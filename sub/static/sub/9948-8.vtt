00:01.301 --> 00:03.844
Anyone watching thinking we know
fuck all about knowing fuck all

00:03.994 --> 00:07.523
about owt,
needs to watch their back...

00:08.286 --> 00:11.365
So you've had your Labour
reclassifying skunk,

00:11.366 --> 00:13.165
sending prices sky-high...

00:13.166 --> 00:17.725
literally, literally taking
the grass from its own roots!

00:17.726 --> 00:19.845
Now you've got your Con-Dem Nation.

00:19.846 --> 00:23.645
Liberals noshing Tories
like altar boys picking dimps up!

00:23.646 --> 00:27.125
Have we had a national
fucking stroke or what?

00:27.126 --> 00:31.005
Is revolution a word?
Or was it never?

00:31.006 --> 00:33.525
Anybody watching needs to know,

00:33.526 --> 00:36.965
we cope better than average
with irony in Chatsworth.

00:36.966 --> 00:40.285
Well, for fucks sake
we live in Manchester

00:40.286 --> 00:43.045
and they charge us for water!

00:43.046 --> 00:48.405
I wandered lonely as a clown,
necking mushrooms rarely found.

00:48.406 --> 00:51.565
This green and pleasant land
in ancient times.

00:51.566 --> 00:54.165
Yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak!

00:54.166 --> 00:57.405
It's not theirs anymore.

00:57.406 --> 00:59.925
This is our England now.

00:59.926 --> 01:02.646
Paaaarty!

01:18.526 --> 01:19.405
Oi!

01:19.406 --> 01:20.805
What?!

01:20.806 --> 01:23.005
Stopping off at your Mam's
for a couple.

01:23.006 --> 01:27.085
Fuck me! Atomic Kitten have let
themselves go a bit, haven't they?

01:27.086 --> 01:29.925
Just come home when the club shuts.
You're on the early.

01:29.926 --> 01:31.485
Yes, Dad - love you.

01:31.486 --> 01:35.005
'The thing about mistakes is,
you can't undo them.

01:35.006 --> 01:39.565
'You can repair them, patch them up,
minimize the consequences.

01:39.566 --> 01:42.325
'But you can't undo them.

01:42.326 --> 01:45.925
'Fuck knows I've made more than most
and they define me.

01:45.926 --> 01:49.765
'Carry them with me everywhere I go.
True of us all.'

01:49.766 --> 01:50.805
Ladies!

01:50.806 --> 01:52.885
Couldn't fucking catch you, though.

01:52.886 --> 01:54.246
'If it's any consolation,

01:54.247 --> 01:58.405
'there's not one of us skates
through life without mistakes.

01:58.406 --> 02:01.326
'Well, none of the interesting ones,
any road.'

02:05.166 --> 02:06.965
Come on, Marty.

02:06.966 --> 02:08.645
Shit!

02:08.645 --> 02:09.764
Careful!

02:09.765 --> 02:10.846
Fuck! Fuck a duck.

02:10.847 --> 02:12.086
Hurry up.

02:21.486 --> 02:25.766
I've got 10 metres of cable round
my neck - it's not easy! Arse wipe!

02:27.526 --> 02:29.725
Fucking hell, you nearly
had my head off.

02:29.726 --> 02:32.845
Stop messing about!
Electric's dangerous, dickhead.

02:32.846 --> 02:35.085
Someone's coming!

02:35.086 --> 02:36.406
Aidan!

02:39.726 --> 02:40.885
Fucking hell.

02:40.886 --> 02:42.365
Hold the fucking ladder!

02:42.366 --> 02:43.606
You sure about this?

02:43.607 --> 02:45.165
Can't pay, won't pay.

02:45.166 --> 02:48.485
If we don't do this we've got
no heating, no fridge, no cooker.

02:48.486 --> 02:49.486
No X-Box.

02:58.246 --> 02:59.246
OW!

03:05.486 --> 03:06.846
Agh!

03:08.686 --> 03:11.086
Oh, my God, Eamonn!

03:17.726 --> 03:19.446
Oh, shit.

03:23.326 --> 03:26.685
All right, calm it.
Just blown a fuse that's all.

03:26.686 --> 03:29.846
I can lend you
a Greek Euro for the meter.

03:39.206 --> 03:41.565
Right, that's the last
from the lock-up.

03:41.566 --> 03:43.685
If you smell burning,
switch it off.

03:43.686 --> 03:45.885
Oh, great. House'll be on fire.

03:45.886 --> 03:47.765
Mimi, all the lights are off.

03:47.766 --> 03:50.206
And I've got Stella,
I just don't know what to do.

03:50.207 --> 03:53.845
Straight upstairs, Tish,
put her next to Cilla and Connor.

03:53.846 --> 03:56.845
Whole area's pitch black,
no street lights nothing.

03:56.846 --> 04:00.725
It's ridiculous! Took 72 hours
to restore power the last time.

04:00.726 --> 04:03.525
Why do people say 72 hours?
Why not just say two days?

04:03.526 --> 04:06.885
Rain Man's got nothing on you,
has he?

04:06.886 --> 04:08.966
Jamie's gonna stay open a bit,
until people can see their way home.

04:08.967 --> 04:10.405
Yeah, proper Maguire.

04:10.406 --> 04:12.965
Any chance to get a few coppers
in your back pocket.

04:12.966 --> 04:15.765
Er, not seen you
turning down shifts, lady.

04:15.766 --> 04:16.846
If they're staying open, can we...?

04:16.846 --> 04:18.644
Yeah, everyone fuck off,

04:18.646 --> 04:22.885
I'll look after the ranch
in the dark, on me own.

04:22.886 --> 04:26.325
Girls, girls,
maybe we don't go into town tonight.

04:26.326 --> 04:28.725
Oh, don't cancel on my account,
I'd feel bad.

04:28.726 --> 04:32.165
You can't see anything out there,
and in these fucking heels?

04:32.166 --> 04:33.444
We'd have to get
a mini-cab in the dark.

04:33.445 --> 04:35.204
Probably no power on in town anyway.

04:35.205 --> 04:36.406
Another night then, ladies?

04:36.407 --> 04:39.965
Right. You go get some smokes,
I'll see you there.

04:39.966 --> 04:41.366
Why do I have to go?

04:42.726 --> 04:44.205
I'll clock you.

04:44.206 --> 04:46.006
See if you can beat your best time.

04:48.126 --> 04:49.246
Go!

04:51.006 --> 04:52.805
What a knobhead.

04:52.806 --> 04:55.405
Eh, don't look at me,
you married him.

04:55.406 --> 04:58.926
I always had shit taste in men.
I married your father.

05:03.566 --> 05:04.566
Oh, fuck!

05:18.166 --> 05:19.805
Fuck off! I've got a weapon!

05:19.806 --> 05:21.926
Ches, it's me - open up.

05:25.406 --> 05:27.805
Fuck!

05:27.806 --> 05:29.965
Fucking hell, man.
I nearly shat myself.

05:29.966 --> 05:31.566
Lock that door!

05:33.366 --> 05:35.765
40 smokes, please, mate, quick-time.

05:35.766 --> 05:36.686
You what?

05:36.687 --> 05:39.445
Hello, earth to Chesney.
I'm on the clock, man.

05:39.446 --> 05:40.366
Shane's timing me.

05:40.367 --> 05:44.165
I'm trying to save my stock.
I'm not open.

05:44.166 --> 05:46.446
I'll help myself,
leave the money on the counter?

05:46.447 --> 05:47.805
I said no.

05:47.806 --> 05:48.926
Fucking hell!

05:50.806 --> 05:52.885
Fuck me, man.

05:52.886 --> 05:55.125
If I help you,
will you let me have my cigs?

05:55.126 --> 05:58.125
Get this in the fucking chest
freezer and I'll give 'em yer!

05:58.126 --> 05:59.126
Hurry up!

06:02.246 --> 06:04.406
Fuck's sake, Jackson!

06:09.806 --> 06:12.206
Fucking hell, boys,
that were a lucky escape.

06:14.606 --> 06:16.325
At least we're not dry, girls.

06:16.326 --> 06:18.245
Yeah!

06:18.246 --> 06:20.365
Actually, I'm gonna
head round Lillian's.

06:20.366 --> 06:21.925
Oh, Kels!

06:21.926 --> 06:24.525
Oh, shut the fuck up!
It's all the more for you, innit.

06:24.526 --> 06:26.765
Walk her round, lad.

06:26.766 --> 06:28.805
It'll get ropey out there
pretty quickly.

06:28.806 --> 06:30.085
I'll go with.

06:30.086 --> 06:32.645
Make sure you drop
a trail of breadcrumbs,

06:32.646 --> 06:34.325
so you can find your way home.

06:34.326 --> 06:35.526
Is this what it was like
during the Blitz, Missus C?

06:35.527 --> 06:38.285
What the feck would I know
about the Blitz?

06:38.286 --> 06:41.325
Do I look as if I'm 112 years old?

06:41.326 --> 06:43.326
Don't answer that, girls!

06:47.646 --> 06:50.885
Right, the pumps are off
so it's bottles and optics only.

06:50.886 --> 06:53.525
And the tills are down,
so cash in hand and no tick.

06:53.526 --> 06:54.286
Ohhh!

06:54.287 --> 06:56.805
It's the end of the night,
no-one's got any money left.

06:56.806 --> 06:59.725
You think I'm letting you lot
fill up on the tab, after dark,

06:59.726 --> 07:01.765
best get the lobotomy reversed, mate.

07:01.766 --> 07:04.685
Jamie, that don't strictly apply
to family though, does it?

07:04.686 --> 07:06.565
Especially family.

07:06.566 --> 07:09.645
All right, stick this behind
the bar and see how far it gets us.

07:09.646 --> 07:12.645
Must be 150 notes here.

07:12.646 --> 07:14.965
Us priests get a lot of stuff,
including money.

07:14.966 --> 07:18.045
It comes and goes.
It's not important.

07:18.046 --> 07:22.245
I'll accept your drink,
but I don't trust you one bit.

07:22.246 --> 07:24.645
Thought your lot
took a vow of poverty?

07:24.646 --> 07:28.325
Well, that we do. But, y'know,
I get a regular monthly stipend.

07:28.326 --> 07:30.285
I don't have much use for it.

07:30.286 --> 07:34.645
Don't fucking cloud the issue
with explanations!

07:34.646 --> 07:38.605
Goes against nature,
a man giving away money.

07:38.606 --> 07:40.845
Stick some tunes on,
it's like death in here.

07:40.846 --> 07:43.885
What part of "power cut"
don't you get?

07:43.886 --> 07:45.006
Oi, what you doing?

07:45.007 --> 07:48.325
We can't play Killer
in the dark, can we?

07:48.326 --> 07:49.686
Use your head, man.

07:51.246 --> 07:53.525
Oooh! Oooh!

07:53.526 --> 07:57.365
Look what that bitch upstairs
has done to my arse.

07:57.366 --> 07:58.805
Have you seen this?

07:58.806 --> 08:00.086
What's going on?

08:00.087 --> 08:02.445
Black-out.
Brings out more horn in folk.

08:02.446 --> 08:04.525
Where's security,
a night like tonight?

08:04.526 --> 08:05.685
Went shopping.

08:05.686 --> 08:08.085
Said he were gonna get
a new telly and trainers.

08:08.086 --> 08:11.445
This is fucking madness,
and not the good kind.

08:11.446 --> 08:12.765
We're on top of it.

08:12.766 --> 08:14.726
Where the fuck d'you think
you're going with that?

08:14.727 --> 08:16.605
I arrived with this, it's mine.

08:16.606 --> 08:18.805
It's the same one as we've got.

08:18.806 --> 08:21.725
Cheers for the guard of honour,
I'm sticking around.

08:21.726 --> 08:22.404
Mind if we stay?

08:22.405 --> 08:23.566
Do what you want.

08:23.567 --> 08:25.326
Just put it fucking down!

08:26.526 --> 08:29.925
So, Terry McInally
is the one I always think of

08:29.926 --> 08:31.485
as the one that got away.

08:31.486 --> 08:33.565
Oooh, God!

08:33.566 --> 08:35.245
Give us one of them.

08:35.246 --> 08:37.284
I don't think I have
"one that got away",

08:37.285 --> 08:39.046
cos I don't think
I've been in love.

08:39.047 --> 08:40.125
Oh, fuck off!

08:40.126 --> 08:42.924
I was in love on a weekly basis
when I was your age.

08:42.926 --> 08:44.445
I've told you before...

08:44.446 --> 08:47.685
love and blow-jobs,
not the same thing.

08:47.686 --> 08:51.765
What kind of women are you,
bragging to anyone who'll listen

08:51.766 --> 08:54.325
about how many men
you've had between your legs?

08:54.326 --> 08:56.565
Quite right, Patricia.

08:56.566 --> 09:00.125
A woman's tickly bits
are for child bearing only.

09:00.126 --> 09:03.166
Anything else,
"it is the Devil's work."

09:05.886 --> 09:08.125
I'm telling you something.

09:08.126 --> 09:11.725
We are for child-rearing,
every one of us.

09:11.726 --> 09:15.085
I've had seven kids

09:15.086 --> 09:18.005
and I'd have seven more
if the clock was on my side.

09:18.006 --> 09:20.045
Having kids is not for everyone.

09:20.046 --> 09:23.525
Fucking should be.
What else are we here for?

09:23.526 --> 09:24.564
I will second that.

09:24.565 --> 09:25.326
I can't go with that.

09:25.327 --> 09:26.965
You don't have kids.

09:26.966 --> 09:29.325
How do you know that, eh?

09:29.326 --> 09:31.805
I've been around a long time
before I met you,

09:31.806 --> 09:34.285
and I've still got a few years
left in me.

09:34.286 --> 09:39.045
And there's more to mothering
than just squeezing one out.

09:39.046 --> 09:43.245
It's not just biology,
it's practical stuff, circumstances.

09:43.246 --> 09:45.085
Oh, what - giving babies away?

09:45.086 --> 09:49.125
Don't get me started on them.
I am a mother

09:49.126 --> 09:54.845
and any woman who gives
a baby away is beyond me.

09:54.846 --> 09:58.045
I'm not having that.

09:58.046 --> 10:00.246
I was adopted.

10:03.846 --> 10:06.406
Oh, fuck!

10:07.726 --> 10:09.725
So Dominic's not your brother?

10:09.726 --> 10:14.365
He is my brother.
Same DNA, same biological parents.

10:14.366 --> 10:16.565
I'm sorry, just...

10:16.566 --> 10:19.245
I could tell there
was something about him.

10:19.246 --> 10:21.805
Not him. Just me.

10:21.806 --> 10:24.885
Born a year ahead of Dominic.

10:24.886 --> 10:29.446
When he arrived, kept him,
sent me out to adoption.

10:31.086 --> 10:32.405
Off I went.

10:32.406 --> 10:36.326
Now there's a story worth
cutting the fecking power for!

10:45.748 --> 10:47.387
Get off me!

10:48.594 --> 10:50.553
This is outrageous!

10:50.554 --> 10:53.794
I want to talk to a fucking lawyer!

11:00.994 --> 11:02.393
Freak!

11:02.394 --> 11:04.713
Fucking hell, I nearly laid an egg.

11:04.714 --> 11:06.913
Didn't mean to startle you.

11:06.914 --> 11:07.834
What are you doing in here?

11:07.835 --> 11:10.473
I think I'm here... for a reason.

11:10.474 --> 11:13.073
What the fuck is this place?

11:13.074 --> 11:15.113
Basements of the Council Buildings,

11:15.114 --> 11:17.713
used to be a jail
in Victorian times.

11:17.714 --> 11:20.593
All the cop shops were shut
and no power - Judas!

11:20.594 --> 11:21.554
What did they get you for?

11:21.555 --> 11:22.873
I was mugged!

11:22.874 --> 11:25.593
Coming back from work
some scumbags thumped me,

11:25.594 --> 11:27.873
grabbed my purse, bag, jacket,
everything.

11:27.874 --> 11:30.873
So... how come they arrested you?

11:30.874 --> 11:32.874
I'm black.

11:34.234 --> 11:38.913
They assumed because of this
and this that I must be a criminal.

11:38.914 --> 11:43.514
You're not, you've got a good soul,
I can tell.

11:52.394 --> 11:54.873
How could she keep one
and give the other away?

11:54.874 --> 11:56.393
You'll have to ask her.

11:56.394 --> 11:58.793
You never traced her?

11:58.794 --> 12:00.993
I've met her a number of times,
with Dominic,

12:00.994 --> 12:05.633
but she made it quite clear she
doesn't give a shit - no regrets.

12:05.634 --> 12:09.033
You're a dark horse,
how long have I known you?

12:09.034 --> 12:10.673
Some things are kept secret.

12:10.674 --> 12:14.353
Not her! I'm married to her son,
and I could tell you

12:14.354 --> 12:17.593
how often she changes
the batteries in her vibrator.

12:17.594 --> 12:23.514
Some people are just cold,
never intended as mothers.

12:25.794 --> 12:28.073
The best guess is that
she's one of these women

12:28.074 --> 12:31.713
who sees other women
as competition, a threat.

12:31.714 --> 12:34.153
Fuck off! Her own daughter?

12:34.154 --> 12:38.033
Dominic's her little prince,
still is to this day.

12:38.034 --> 12:41.753
I'm just some... bitch she had
the misfortune to give birth to

12:41.754 --> 12:42.952
before he arrived.

12:42.953 --> 12:43.954
But you get on all right with Dom?

12:43.955 --> 12:47.874
He's fucked up in his own way,
but he's a good man.

12:50.914 --> 12:52.953
Can't get my head around a mother

12:52.954 --> 12:55.513
keeping one baby
and giving another away.

12:55.514 --> 12:57.113
How old was your Gloria then?

12:57.114 --> 12:59.073
When she was adopted? 11 months.

12:59.074 --> 13:00.354
Does that not bother you?

13:00.355 --> 13:04.074
Course it bothers me, but I haven't
got a time machine, have I?

13:07.234 --> 13:10.033
Probably why she's such
a hard-nosed bitch.

13:10.034 --> 13:12.553
Watch your mouth, Frank, all right?

13:12.554 --> 13:15.633
I'm only speaking the truth.
Lovely girl, your sister,

13:15.634 --> 13:18.433
wrapped around the temperament
of a Tasmanian Devil.

13:18.434 --> 13:23.154
No wonder she's 40, single,
and got her brother for a lodger.

13:24.194 --> 13:26.994
Fine. I will "watch my mouth".

13:30.874 --> 13:32.514
No pressure.

13:35.834 --> 13:36.874
Come here.

13:39.274 --> 13:42.113
I don't fucking think so, mate,
do you?

13:42.114 --> 13:44.313
Try potting a fucking ball first.

13:44.314 --> 13:44.954
Truth or forfeit?

13:44.955 --> 13:46.353
Fuck off.

13:46.354 --> 13:47.514
Hey! Well, don't fucking play, then.

13:47.515 --> 13:49.393
All right - truth.

13:49.394 --> 13:50.794
Okey-doke.

13:53.954 --> 13:56.593
Other than Avril,

13:56.594 --> 14:01.993
which woman have you most recently
had a wank about, you dirty cunt?

14:01.994 --> 14:03.233
Fuck off.

14:03.234 --> 14:05.913
If you don't like the fucking
question, take the forfeit.

14:05.914 --> 14:07.554
Come on, speak the truth.

14:09.154 --> 14:10.633
Your Ruby.

14:10.634 --> 14:13.753
It's her fucking tits, man,
they're hypnotic.

14:13.754 --> 14:15.153
I do know what you mean.

14:15.154 --> 14:17.793
They kind of sit up
all by themselves, don't they?

14:17.794 --> 14:20.313
I mean, I don't think
she's aware of it, Jackson.

14:20.314 --> 14:21.234
Your go, Frank.

14:21.235 --> 14:23.793
All right, all right, fucking hell.

14:23.794 --> 14:25.874
Late for vespers, are we?

14:31.554 --> 14:32.833
Fuck off!

14:32.834 --> 14:35.433
Truth or forfeit? Truth or forfeit?

14:35.434 --> 14:36.554
Forfeit.

14:46.834 --> 14:50.073
I don't like him being exploited
like this.

14:50.074 --> 14:52.353
He's not a circus freak.

14:52.354 --> 14:54.353
Fucking stupid forfeit, anyway.

14:54.354 --> 14:59.833
Not so much a forfeit, as a bet -
the Hare and the Tortoise,

14:59.834 --> 15:01.274
it's the eternal question.

15:01.275 --> 15:06.673
He's right, it's a stupid bet,
I'm five paces from victory.

15:06.674 --> 15:11.474
Then, demonstrate...
your superiority.

15:16.874 --> 15:18.274
Yeah...

15:19.394 --> 15:24.273
a little pre-race pick-me-up...

15:24.274 --> 15:25.714
will see me just fine.

15:35.034 --> 15:39.074
Do I look like I want to be
fucking whipped?

15:40.554 --> 15:41.714
Sorry.

15:43.074 --> 15:45.753
Boiled in your very own milk-pan,

15:45.754 --> 15:47.394
Red Bull for the wrinklies...

15:51.154 --> 15:53.753
cocoa with 12 sugars.

15:53.754 --> 15:55.874
Cor, I could do with a booster.
Not you!

15:57.314 --> 16:00.273
How did it come to this?

16:00.274 --> 16:02.673
We're keeping it together.

16:02.674 --> 16:04.233
You look like a mole with a kink.

16:04.234 --> 16:07.833
It's a mess. There's fellas been
waiting here two hours.

16:07.834 --> 16:10.314
That bloke's so fed up
he's gone home to shag his wife.

16:10.315 --> 16:12.193
That's how desperate he's got.

16:12.194 --> 16:13.953
I thought busy was good.

16:13.954 --> 16:18.113
It's more than just volume,
size does matter, in every sense,

16:18.114 --> 16:19.753
but in here it's about turnover...

16:19.754 --> 16:24.233
count them in, count them out,
the quicker the better.

16:24.234 --> 16:27.113
There's not a man here
I couldn't have shooting his load

16:27.114 --> 16:29.393
in three minutes
from a standing stare,

16:29.394 --> 16:30.834
because I'm a professional.

16:30.835 --> 16:34.353
What are your lot doing upstairs,
rolling about in bed for an hour?

16:34.354 --> 16:38.634
It's time to hang up the gusset,
Trigger, put on the business suit.

16:40.234 --> 16:42.072
Has anybody seen the paddling pool?

16:42.073 --> 16:43.552
They didn't teach us this in Sex Ed.

16:43.553 --> 16:44.914
How do people end up like this?

16:44.915 --> 16:46.793
Like what?

16:46.794 --> 16:52.033
In rubber, nappies, Scottish,
S&M - what's all that about?

16:52.034 --> 16:53.673
They must have been like us once.

16:53.674 --> 16:57.153
Idiots like this put food on
our table when I was little.

16:57.154 --> 17:00.313
Mum brought a different bloke
back every night,

17:00.314 --> 17:02.234
usually sober enough to pay.

17:04.074 --> 17:05.634
What was it like?

17:07.074 --> 17:09.634
Didn't know any better,
so... I didn't care.

17:11.114 --> 17:12.433
And what about now?

17:12.434 --> 17:14.113
Doesn't faze me.

17:14.114 --> 17:17.512
Do me a favour.

17:17.513 --> 17:21.114
Promise me you won't do any shit
like this, even when you get old.

17:26.154 --> 17:30.554
Oi! I insist on speaking
to a legal representative.

17:31.914 --> 17:34.433
Good for you, I'm proud of you.

17:34.434 --> 17:37.633
Whatever happened to human rights?

17:37.634 --> 17:40.714
Don't let it get under your skin -
Gollywog!

17:42.634 --> 17:44.353
You fucking racist.

17:44.354 --> 17:45.713
I'm not.

17:45.714 --> 17:47.953
You're the one who planted
the racist seed,

17:47.954 --> 17:51.033
saying they arrested you because
you're black - rubber lips!

17:51.034 --> 17:52.074
I can't not say it.

17:52.075 --> 17:55.353
So your Tourettes causes you
to be racist?

17:55.354 --> 17:56.713
No, it's like,

17:56.714 --> 17:59.793
if I said to you right now,
"Big hairy arse",

17:59.794 --> 18:01.673
you can't not see one.

18:01.674 --> 18:05.514
In some cultures,
it's a sign of genius.

18:10.034 --> 18:13.593
You little dickheads.
You stay there, little prick.

18:13.594 --> 18:16.513
You're little shit-bags, c'mon then!

18:16.514 --> 18:19.433
Fucking come back!

18:19.434 --> 18:20.553
What?!

18:20.554 --> 18:22.753
Shut up! We don't really want them
to come back.

18:22.754 --> 18:24.034
What, you scared?

18:24.035 --> 18:26.273
Thought you did all
body-building shit.

18:26.274 --> 18:29.153
Yeah, I am scared. Me and you,
trapped here, in the Alamo!

18:29.154 --> 18:31.873
What about when they throw
a fucking petrol bomb in here?

18:31.874 --> 18:35.033
Not with the price of petrol
these days, mate.

18:35.034 --> 18:37.553
And, it's not body building,
it's body-sculpting.

18:37.554 --> 18:40.953
I don't want big fuck-off
Terminator muscles.

18:40.954 --> 18:44.234
I'm a whippet... but I'll be
the perfect whippet.

18:49.914 --> 18:51.273
That's us sorted.

18:51.274 --> 18:53.393
Why don't you come with us, man?

18:53.394 --> 18:55.473
It'll be a riot in The Jockey
tonight.

18:55.474 --> 18:57.312
Oh, you've got to guard
the shop now.

18:57.313 --> 18:58.514
Chill and have a beer.

18:58.515 --> 19:01.873
What do you want to be a little
ferret for anyway?

19:01.874 --> 19:05.113
Big muscles are fucking awesome.

19:05.114 --> 19:07.713
Not ferret, whippet. Cheers.

19:07.714 --> 19:09.314
Cheers, mate.

19:10.594 --> 19:14.873
48, 48, 49, 49, 50, 50.

19:14.874 --> 19:18.433
Light weights, rapid reps,
minimal recovery.

19:18.434 --> 19:20.793
It's cardio,
oxygen into the blood-stream...

19:20.794 --> 19:25.034
exhale on the up,
inhale on the down.

19:26.314 --> 19:28.033
It's about strength and stamina.

19:28.034 --> 19:31.594
I'm naturally fit me, mate.

19:35.434 --> 19:38.794
It's not about fitness,
it's about control, yeah?

19:40.034 --> 19:42.514
Nothing can fucking touch me.

19:43.754 --> 19:46.833
You haven't got any control,
nobody has.

19:46.834 --> 19:47.993
You're wrong.

19:47.994 --> 19:51.313
I'm fucking right. D'you think
I don't know you're laughing at me?

19:51.314 --> 19:52.793
That everybody is?

19:52.794 --> 19:56.073
Fucking Shane, "Go on Billy,
run to the shops, I'll time you".

19:56.074 --> 19:59.073
Know what I mean?
I'm not a complete idiot, you know?

19:59.074 --> 20:02.753
That's my role.
I don't have to accept it, but I do.

20:02.754 --> 20:06.633
Keeps me warm, gives me grub,
what's the alternative?

20:06.634 --> 20:08.033
Be your own man?

20:08.034 --> 20:11.033
Listen, I've got a wife
who's got kids and grandkids here,

20:11.034 --> 20:12.913
I don't want to be my own man.

20:12.914 --> 20:14.152
You're aiming low, mate.

20:14.153 --> 20:15.274
Well, look at you!

20:15.275 --> 20:20.393
What's this gonna do, let you live
three months, six months longer?

20:20.394 --> 20:21.953
Says who, Manchester Man?

20:21.954 --> 20:26.033
Fucking proud, mate! Any exercise
you can name, I'll take you, mate.

20:26.034 --> 20:30.434
Go on then, son. Let's have you
on that fucking bench, eh?

20:34.794 --> 20:38.073
I am sorry, I know what a bastard
words can be, more than most.

20:38.074 --> 20:40.113
Even when people don't say
those words,

20:40.114 --> 20:43.873
you know they're thinking them,
every day.

20:43.874 --> 20:44.954
It's exhausting.

20:44.955 --> 20:49.674
You mustn't judge people,
they know not what they do.

20:52.434 --> 20:56.873
To the English, I'm this fucking...
"darkie",

20:56.874 --> 20:59.633
and to the Africans,
I'm fucking English.

20:59.634 --> 21:03.513
Jackson's mum, a proud Nigerian
woman, she thinks her son married

21:03.514 --> 21:06.153
beneath himself,
cos I'm from the Caribbean.

21:06.154 --> 21:09.953
My mum thinks I've hooked up
with someone from the Dark Ages,

21:09.954 --> 21:12.833
because he's only second generation.

21:12.834 --> 21:14.434
I'm tired of it.

21:18.354 --> 21:22.233
Maybe that's my role, to bring
people together with my words.

21:22.234 --> 21:24.593
Clit-lick every trip!

21:24.594 --> 21:25.794
What are you on about?

21:27.354 --> 21:31.833
I could've died tonight,
enough electricity to power a city,

21:31.834 --> 21:34.234
should've fried me - it didn't.

21:36.634 --> 21:38.634
I think I've been saved for
a reason.

21:42.354 --> 21:44.713
I've been chosen.

21:44.714 --> 21:46.273
Fisher, Martin.

21:46.274 --> 21:50.194
Front and centre,
you're being released.

21:51.354 --> 21:52.474
How comes he gets out?

21:52.475 --> 21:56.713
How the fuck should I know?
It's an order from above.

21:56.714 --> 21:57.993
See?

21:57.994 --> 21:59.473
♪ Hallelujah

21:59.474 --> 22:02.553
♪ Hallelujah, hallelujah... ♪

22:02.554 --> 22:05.273
I'll be back to free you
and all your people.

22:05.274 --> 22:07.473
Ah! Uncle Tom!

22:07.474 --> 22:12.274
On behalf of all "my people"
don't worry about it, jog on!

22:15.594 --> 22:17.953
Where's my fucking phone call?!

22:17.954 --> 22:20.353
C'mon, time's running out, Jackson!

22:20.354 --> 22:23.074
Oi, you're on the fucking baize!

22:24.714 --> 22:27.713
Bastard. Terry, how's Terry?

22:27.714 --> 22:28.834
Moving at a lick.

22:28.835 --> 22:30.994
Time to leap into action, then.

22:33.194 --> 22:35.913
Something amusing
our Vatican correspondent?

22:35.914 --> 22:40.514
I'm a happy drunk, Frank.
The last days of Sodom.

22:43.314 --> 22:45.074
Where's me fags?

22:49.874 --> 22:51.873
Oh, very fucking funny.

22:51.874 --> 22:54.714
You've got ten seconds left, man,
come on!

23:00.434 --> 23:01.753
Fuck off!

23:01.754 --> 23:03.633
Where's my coat?

23:03.634 --> 23:05.233
Wherever you left it.

23:05.234 --> 23:06.753
I hung it over the stool.

23:06.754 --> 23:08.473
Then you must've moved it.

23:08.474 --> 23:10.714
I didn't fucking move it!

23:12.834 --> 23:17.434
SOMEONE'S HAD MY PARKA!

23:22.838 --> 23:24.573
Sorry, mate - no sign.

23:24.636 --> 23:27.515
You don't... it's not just...

23:27.516 --> 23:29.875
Look, it's more than sentimental...

23:29.876 --> 23:31.475
I'll sue!

23:31.476 --> 23:34.035
For the value of a Parka?

23:34.036 --> 23:36.076
Here y'are - call that
a generous out-of-court settlement.

23:36.077 --> 23:38.555
Oh, yeah! It's all right
for you, innit,

23:38.556 --> 23:41.235
with your fucking pub,
and your wife

23:41.236 --> 23:42.875
and your... dimples!

23:42.876 --> 23:44.635
All my dreams come true, this!

23:44.636 --> 23:46.675
But what the fuck have I got, eh?!

23:46.676 --> 23:48.396
Once the lights come on,
we'll find it.

23:48.397 --> 23:51.635
Oh, there's been traffic
in and out all night!

23:51.636 --> 23:55.755
Could be anywhere by now! What kind
of fucking lock-in is it, anyway?!

23:55.756 --> 23:57.115
It's just a coat, mate.

23:57.116 --> 23:58.236
No.

24:00.596 --> 24:04.835
I wore that coat
the night our Fiona was born!

24:04.836 --> 24:08.435
I was wearing it the night
she was conceived.

24:08.436 --> 24:12.355
And now, I've lost two wives!

24:12.356 --> 24:15.635
Monica... Sheila, all me kids...

24:15.636 --> 24:18.755
little Debbie, Lip...

24:18.756 --> 24:19.915
curly hair...?

24:19.916 --> 24:20.875
Liam!

24:20.876 --> 24:23.195
Liam! The other one!

24:23.196 --> 24:25.035
They've all deserted me!

24:25.036 --> 24:25.996
Apart from Stella.

24:25.997 --> 24:28.115
Apart from Stella!

24:28.116 --> 24:32.716
That Parka was... me!

24:33.836 --> 24:39.076
It was as part of me as a...
as an arm, or a leg and...

24:40.636 --> 24:43.315
It's who I am.

24:43.316 --> 24:44.676
Where did you get it from?

24:44.677 --> 24:47.075
I stole it off
a striking miner on the bus.

24:47.076 --> 24:48.395
Fuck!

24:48.396 --> 24:51.835
He was coming back
from the Battle of Orgreave.

24:51.836 --> 24:54.955
He'd had a skinful to numb
the pain of the battering.

24:54.956 --> 24:57.875
Could've took his wallet
as well - didn't!

24:57.876 --> 24:59.996
Oh, you're all heart!

25:01.236 --> 25:03.675
How...

25:03.676 --> 25:08.876
will I... recognise... me?

25:42.876 --> 25:44.235
Come on!

25:44.236 --> 25:47.595
Let's you and me go
and have a look for it, eh?

25:47.596 --> 25:49.756
Never know, your luck might change.

25:52.156 --> 25:54.875
Yeah, maybe.

25:54.876 --> 25:57.156
Thank you, Dominic!

25:59.396 --> 26:02.116
Hey look, Frank - Turtle wins again!

26:17.116 --> 26:19.476
Bless you!

26:25.996 --> 26:28.035
I really admire her.

26:28.036 --> 26:29.715
Fuck off!

26:29.716 --> 26:34.075
I do! Bold as you like, in control,
organising everyone.

26:34.076 --> 26:37.355
Another time, another place,
she could've been someone.

26:37.356 --> 26:39.795
What's with all the make-up, though?

26:39.796 --> 26:45.276
Be back down in 15 minutes or less!
Hair-trigger discount applies, yeah?

26:48.036 --> 26:52.595
The reason it's the world's oldest
profession is because it works...

26:52.596 --> 26:55.915
men are like them little
David Attenborough fucking monkeys

26:55.916 --> 26:58.315
that eat ripe fruit
and tug themselves off...

26:58.316 --> 27:01.755
be at it day and night
if they could - endless demand!

27:01.756 --> 27:04.275
Doesn't mean we have to be
sloppy or inefficient...

27:04.276 --> 27:07.435
we get 'em in, bleed 'em dry
and get 'em out!

27:07.436 --> 27:09.795
We get organised,
we could rule the world.

27:09.796 --> 27:11.956
Is that you, Kelly?

27:13.356 --> 27:16.195
You are the only person
I have ever met

27:16.196 --> 27:19.355
where only one sense works
at a time!

27:19.356 --> 27:23.595
And so, Curtis Pendleton
is "The one that got away".

27:23.596 --> 27:27.515
Ha! Another one?! A fair few seem
to have got away from you.

27:27.516 --> 27:30.555
"Escaped" is the word
we're looking for.

27:30.556 --> 27:33.595
Hey! Not too many
escaped you, did they?

27:33.596 --> 27:38.315
No. I brought pleasure to the masses
and then my prince arrived.

27:38.316 --> 27:43.515
He's my son, and even I think it's
stretching it to call him a prince.

27:43.516 --> 27:44.995
Fuck's sake!

27:44.996 --> 27:49.235
Don't tell me you believe in all
this "Happy Ever After" bollocks!

27:49.236 --> 27:51.555
Yeah, I kinda do!
I think you've got to.

27:51.556 --> 27:58.035
There's a reason it's a fairy-tale -
not one of us can escape our pasts.

27:58.036 --> 27:59.555
Amen!

27:59.556 --> 28:06.155
How can you have a past at 21?
Survive the fall of Saigon, did you?

28:06.156 --> 28:10.915
Five years captive in Guantanamo
without so much as a drink of water?

28:10.916 --> 28:13.195
Yeah - all of that.

28:13.196 --> 28:16.955
We could all sit around
boo-hooing about our past!

28:16.956 --> 28:19.796
Boo-hoo!

28:27.516 --> 28:28.915
Give it up, lads!

28:28.916 --> 28:29.796
Who the fuck's this guy?

28:29.797 --> 28:32.115
Fuck off! Fucking freak!

28:32.116 --> 28:33.276
I won't harm you!

28:33.277 --> 28:34.555
You what?!

28:34.556 --> 28:35.956
I love you! Jesus in a nappy!

28:38.716 --> 28:40.636
Freak!

28:50.516 --> 28:52.395
Fear not!

28:52.396 --> 28:54.236
For I am with you!

28:56.396 --> 28:59.436
Fuck off, Marty!

29:02.916 --> 29:04.715
Everything all right?

29:04.716 --> 29:08.435
Everybody's got history, you know.
Everybody's got a sob story.

29:08.436 --> 29:09.356
Of course.

29:09.357 --> 29:13.835
Sitting round, all sharing each
other's misery - it's like getting

29:13.836 --> 29:18.315
excuses in early to explain why life
isn't fair for "poor little old me"!

29:18.316 --> 29:20.596
I'm not sure
what you're talking about.

29:21.836 --> 29:26.675
Life is hard - you fuck up,
you pay the consequences. I have.

29:26.676 --> 29:30.715
Well, we all have!
So what's your point?

29:30.716 --> 29:33.875
Look, you're adopted,
it's a real shame.

29:33.876 --> 29:37.955
You know, you're not without
your problems yourself.

29:37.956 --> 29:40.875
All that soul searching,
all that support from the group.

29:40.876 --> 29:44.115
I've got an illness,
but have you heard me mention it

29:44.116 --> 29:46.595
once tonight?! Nah!

29:46.596 --> 29:50.035
Oh, so now you are the picture
of blame-free happiness, are you?

29:50.036 --> 29:53.595
Yeah, my life's
pretty fucking great!

29:53.596 --> 29:56.596
And yet, you're still an arsehole!

29:57.676 --> 29:58.436
SMACK!

29:58.437 --> 30:00.035
What was that?!

30:00.036 --> 30:01.755
Oh, for fuck's sake!

30:01.756 --> 30:02.876
Take it easy!

30:04.476 --> 30:08.635
Pack it in! Pack it in!

30:08.636 --> 30:10.395
Pack it in!

30:10.396 --> 30:10.836
Bitch!

30:10.837 --> 30:12.516
Jesus!

30:13.596 --> 30:17.595
You've got some fucking bottle,
going for a Maguire!

30:17.596 --> 30:19.636
Anytime, bitch!

30:25.556 --> 30:28.035
You're too young
for all these responsibilities.

30:28.036 --> 30:30.155
Shut up! I'm concentrating!

30:30.156 --> 30:35.315
I mean, you should be dreaming big!
The world's your oyster and all that!

30:35.316 --> 30:38.755
Fuck all that! Be happy, don't
matter what anyone thinks of you!

30:38.756 --> 30:40.516
Where's that going
to get you anyway?

30:40.517 --> 30:41.635
Ahead.

30:41.636 --> 30:44.275
Fuck "ahead" - you waste
your life to get "ahead".

30:44.276 --> 30:46.515
Before you know it,
it's all behind you.

30:46.516 --> 30:48.995
D'you read that
on an ice lolly stick?

30:48.996 --> 30:51.235
Shut the fuck up!

30:51.236 --> 30:54.035
You might be happy being
the water boy, mate.

30:54.036 --> 30:55.755
Not me.

30:55.756 --> 30:57.635
Fuck off!

30:57.636 --> 31:02.995
You little pussy! What
happened? Thought you'd beat me, eh?

31:02.996 --> 31:04.435
You distracted me!

31:04.436 --> 31:04.876
Yeah?

31:04.877 --> 31:07.275
Let's do some proper
exercise anyway.

31:07.276 --> 31:11.436
All right, OK. Come on, then, son.
Show us how it's done.

31:13.556 --> 31:16.235
'Ere, you never know

31:16.236 --> 31:17.955
It's not in here.

31:17.956 --> 31:22.115
Tell you what. Have my coat,
will you? Keep warm while we find...

31:22.116 --> 31:25.716
Oh, no, fuck off! I've got more
chance of getting in Terry's shell!

31:26.436 --> 31:28.195
Besides, you'll need it

31:28.196 --> 31:30.835
when you wave Dorothy off
down the Yellow Brick Road.

31:30.836 --> 31:34.515
That's cos I'm a Munchkin, right,
yeah? Maybe, but remember...

31:34.516 --> 31:35.835
Nobody stole my jacket.

31:35.836 --> 31:37.436
Well, why would they?

31:39.876 --> 31:42.515
What about there? You never know,
someone might've slung it.

31:42.516 --> 31:43.836
All right, then.

31:46.716 --> 31:49.196
Stay there, won't you?

31:55.596 --> 31:58.915
What is it with you, eh?

31:58.916 --> 32:03.595
I can't work it out,
and it makes me very uneasy.

32:03.596 --> 32:04.596
I dunno what you mean!

32:04.597 --> 32:06.835
Oh, yes, you do!

32:06.836 --> 32:09.755
You're out here scrabbling around

32:09.756 --> 32:14.155
for a coat with some bastard
you can't possibly like!

32:14.156 --> 32:15.875
I like you, Frank, all right?

32:15.876 --> 32:17.395
See? That!

32:17.396 --> 32:17.834
What?

32:17.835 --> 32:18.234
There!

32:18.235 --> 32:18.676
What?

32:18.677 --> 32:22.235
I don't trust it!

32:22.236 --> 32:27.675
I mean, I've done nothing but insult
you all night and you just... smile!

32:27.676 --> 32:32.596
So what is it? Come here.
Come here, Rasputin, what is it?

32:36.356 --> 32:40.395
What is it? And don't give me
all this "Jesus-Zebediah" shite!

32:40.396 --> 32:42.795
Frank...

32:42.796 --> 32:46.795
I believe in God, all right?
There's no two ways about that.

32:46.796 --> 32:48.676
That's rock solid.
See I know that He...

32:48.677 --> 32:49.676
Or She...

32:49.677 --> 32:51.435
yeah, or She, exists.

32:51.436 --> 32:53.995
Grand designs, making all the plans,

32:53.996 --> 32:56.635
whether you're a Jew,
a Buddhist, a Muslim, a Hindu,

32:56.636 --> 32:58.515
a Shinto - we're all the same.

32:58.516 --> 33:03.195
Whatever he, she or it...
it's there.

33:03.196 --> 33:09.195
Well, as an avowed atheist,
I can only believe in God

33:09.196 --> 33:15.075
when I can perceive
a direct personal threat.

33:15.076 --> 33:16.275
Right.

33:16.276 --> 33:19.675
But I'll choose not
to ridicule your superstition.

33:19.676 --> 33:24.515
See, it's just the people
that I don't buy into, yeah.

33:24.516 --> 33:26.075
I mean, they're dishonest,

33:26.076 --> 33:29.395
aren't they, in it for themselves,
it's all about me, me, me!

33:29.396 --> 33:32.915
Yeah, I can see that would be
a draw-back in your game.

33:32.916 --> 33:38.836
Wouldn't want people being selfish
in the church of God, would we?

33:40.396 --> 33:45.155
Eh, confession must be a laugh,
though. And then there's the wine.

33:45.156 --> 33:47.235
Drink?

33:47.236 --> 33:52.755
No, thank you, it's not quite me...
it's not my vintage.

33:52.756 --> 33:56.595
You know what? This is like
a needle in a haystack, isn't it?

33:56.596 --> 34:02.115
Which is easier for a camel to...

34:02.116 --> 34:07.876
pass into... than... rich man.

34:09.156 --> 34:10.556
That.

34:11.795 --> 34:13.435
Bible stuff.

34:13.436 --> 34:15.436
Oh...

34:18.315 --> 34:20.596
Shall we just search in silence?

34:32.716 --> 34:34.235
Frank?

34:37.676 --> 34:39.114
You fucking freak!

34:39.116 --> 34:41.036
I need to save you!

34:42.275 --> 34:47.356
Take you to the cop shop to help free
a Sister... Sledge! Brown Sugar!

34:49.275 --> 34:53.795
I have power,
I don't want to hurt you.

34:53.795 --> 34:57.276
Forgive me for what
I'm about to do. Crucify!

34:59.676 --> 35:02.876
Ah! That's not supposed to happen!

35:08.796 --> 35:11.036
Go!

35:14.916 --> 35:16.836
I don't understand!

35:18.236 --> 35:20.236
I have power!

35:34.493 --> 35:36.512
We're never out, are we?

35:36.552 --> 35:40.031
I'll go back round
the Jockey and get some more.

35:40.032 --> 35:42.711
No, please.
Would you mind if I did?

35:42.712 --> 35:45.511
I could do with some air.

35:45.512 --> 35:46.392
I will walk with you.

35:46.393 --> 35:49.031
No, really. I'd like to go alone.

35:49.032 --> 35:49.992
I'll tell Jamie you're coming.

35:49.993 --> 35:51.951
I'll be quick.

35:51.952 --> 35:53.032
Hey, go round the back at this time.

35:53.033 --> 35:57.752
Don't hang around. Loads of
knobheads roaming the place now.

35:59.672 --> 36:03.511
So is that, y'know, why you left
the dog-collar business?

36:03.512 --> 36:06.312
Lack of... a crisis of faith
in your fellow man?

36:08.352 --> 36:09.432
What?

36:10.992 --> 36:12.272
Tossers.

36:13.352 --> 36:15.072
As far as I'm concerned, yeah.

36:16.752 --> 36:18.312
And the official story?

36:19.752 --> 36:26.272
Alleged alcoholism and the fact
that I impregnated a 16-year-old.

36:29.152 --> 36:31.551
Girl, I take it?

36:31.552 --> 36:34.751
Yeah. It was a girl
I got pregnant, y'know.

36:34.752 --> 36:39.152
But she was all woman, she could've
passed for 20 any day of the week.

36:41.352 --> 36:43.352
But she lost the baby.

36:46.032 --> 36:47.272
Poor thing.

36:49.472 --> 36:53.031
So, are you barred,
or just suspended for a few games?

36:53.032 --> 36:58.591
The diocese put me on a 24-month
sabbatical, to get myself sorted.

36:58.592 --> 36:59.792
Is that likely?

36:59.793 --> 37:03.271
Look, Frank, I can have sex
with any girl I like, all right?

37:03.272 --> 37:08.232
And I drink as hard as I can,
so I can't think, or remember.

37:10.512 --> 37:13.192
But the demons live on.

37:14.312 --> 37:17.832
Yeah, all that shagging and
drinking. Yes, I feel your pain!

37:20.872 --> 37:22.232
I'm just lost, Frank.

37:24.552 --> 37:28.312
So's me coat. Let's just
deal with that first, shall we?

37:30.432 --> 37:31.712
Come on.

37:38.472 --> 37:39.992
All right, darling?

37:47.512 --> 37:48.552
That you, Gloria?

37:48.553 --> 37:51.631
Oh! You near gave me a heart attack.

37:51.632 --> 37:54.271
Sorry. Three bottles,
two white, one red.

37:54.272 --> 37:56.471
Should see you through
till the morning.

37:56.472 --> 37:59.951
Oh, I don't know. Patty really
knows how to put it away.

37:59.952 --> 38:02.191
How's it going inside?

38:02.192 --> 38:05.031
A Sewing Bee. Yeah,
we're all doing one patch each.

38:05.032 --> 38:07.512
Then we'll put them together
and make a big quilt.

38:07.513 --> 38:10.791
You'll be drinking camomile tea
while you're at it!

38:10.792 --> 38:11.952
Something like that!

38:17.472 --> 38:18.551
Fuck!

38:18.552 --> 38:19.872
Hey, what?

38:21.792 --> 38:25.352
I'm sorry. It's just been
a really strange night.

38:26.672 --> 38:27.872
Don't apologise.

38:42.272 --> 38:43.472
Sorry.

38:44.592 --> 38:45.871
No, I'm...

38:45.872 --> 38:47.272
I'm sorry.

39:12.672 --> 39:16.352
Powell, Avril. Off your arse.

39:18.192 --> 39:18.832
Where'd you get it?

39:18.833 --> 39:20.392
Caught the fuckers what did it.

39:23.672 --> 39:25.471
I told you I'd free you!

39:25.472 --> 39:27.831
Yeah, you foretold it.

39:27.832 --> 39:31.992
Free from the shame,
from the chains of history!

39:33.992 --> 39:38.671
It's important you understand this -
I love my history,

39:38.672 --> 39:42.911
love the West Indies.
Nobody's been through what we have.

39:42.912 --> 39:47.751
Shat on for centuries, on three
continents, and still standing,

39:47.752 --> 39:52.472
The most beautiful,
resilient people on the planet.

39:56.712 --> 39:57.872
Where you going?

39:59.672 --> 40:02.231
Tell them I didn't do it.
I saved you.

40:02.232 --> 40:04.751
If you are the Messiah,
maybe this is your destiny.

40:04.752 --> 40:06.351
He's not the Messiah, he's a...

40:06.352 --> 40:07.792
Don't fucking say it.

40:10.512 --> 40:12.191
Oh! Oh, you dirty bint!

40:12.192 --> 40:16.032
Y'know, I wish I was more like you.
I admire you.

40:17.952 --> 40:19.112
I can see that.

40:19.113 --> 40:21.711
I mean, you might rant and rave
and all the rest of it,

40:21.712 --> 40:25.671
but you're not complicated.
You're the sum of your appetites.

40:25.672 --> 40:28.952
I have never been so insulted.

40:31.352 --> 40:32.871
Or flattered.

40:32.872 --> 40:38.151
See, I need the distraction.
You live the distraction.

40:38.152 --> 40:39.472
Takes discipline.

40:43.112 --> 40:45.671
Your Parka's gone, Frank.

40:45.672 --> 40:48.512
Oh, I have faith.

40:50.312 --> 40:51.551
Do you?

40:51.552 --> 40:54.192
The non-existent Lord will provide.

41:00.232 --> 41:01.551
Oh, I'm tired.

41:01.552 --> 41:03.312
Yeah, I know you are, son.

41:07.032 --> 41:09.392
You won't always be, though.

41:12.832 --> 41:15.872
Better get home, back to our Gloria.

41:19.312 --> 41:20.512
Hey, hurry up now!

41:21.712 --> 41:25.031
In case anyone else
has hopped on your toad-stool,

41:25.032 --> 41:26.952
robbed your fishing pole.

41:35.112 --> 41:36.711
I, er, I'd better...

41:36.712 --> 41:37.792
Do you want me to walk you?

41:37.793 --> 41:40.272
No, that wouldn't be a smart move,
would it?

41:41.592 --> 41:42.912
You've, er...

41:48.992 --> 41:50.552
Thank you.

41:55.672 --> 41:57.151
Did Gloria come?

41:57.152 --> 41:58.432
Yeah.

42:02.432 --> 42:06.551
We're not in it to make friends,
sweetheart. It's business.

42:06.552 --> 42:10.111
And never forget that
we're in the fantasy business.

42:10.112 --> 42:12.752
Never forget that
we're in the fantasy business.

42:14.112 --> 42:15.231
Behave!

42:15.232 --> 42:17.072
I am. I'm cold.

42:19.232 --> 42:22.992
The ABC of prostitution -
Always Be Coming.

42:24.192 --> 42:27.511
In the fantasy business,
Always Be Coming.

42:27.512 --> 42:28.832
Are you still a virgin?

42:30.712 --> 42:32.192
No, I lost it when I was 12.

42:35.832 --> 42:37.791
Makes me sad.

42:37.792 --> 42:39.511
Me too.

42:39.512 --> 42:42.751
If I'm still one when I'm 21...

42:42.752 --> 42:44.192
Yeah, I'll marry you.

42:46.992 --> 42:48.191
I mean...

42:48.192 --> 42:50.552
It's OK. I know what you meant.

42:51.632 --> 42:53.232
'It's like old times!'

42:55.552 --> 42:58.151
Two old slappers in Pit Helmets,

42:58.152 --> 43:03.392
talking about spunk-to-cash ratios,
just like old times.

43:06.432 --> 43:09.271
I'll boil a pan on the stove,
make us a cuppa.

43:09.272 --> 43:10.472
Go on then.

43:13.192 --> 43:14.512
I like it here.

43:18.072 --> 43:19.912
18...

43:22.472 --> 43:23.872
19...

43:25.192 --> 43:26.552
20! Ah!

43:29.232 --> 43:31.951
Honestly, you're so shit, man!

43:31.952 --> 43:33.871
By the time you're, like, 30,

43:33.872 --> 43:37.071
you're going to be like, 16 stone,

43:37.072 --> 43:39.031
big fat gut!

43:39.032 --> 43:42.071
I don't give a shit! As long as
I'm happy, and Mimi loves me.

43:42.072 --> 43:45.711
No chance! You want the same as me.
You want to be the same as me!

43:45.712 --> 43:48.111
You're wrong! I am happy.
You should try it.

43:48.112 --> 43:51.951
You're not seeing what I'm facing,
though! Huh?

43:51.952 --> 43:53.912
Another 40 years
behind this counter,

43:53.913 --> 43:55.551
or another one just like it,

43:55.552 --> 43:58.111
told what I'll do, what I'll earn,

43:58.112 --> 44:00.911
what my life is! By who?

44:00.912 --> 44:03.111
By a bunch of old guys with beards.

44:03.112 --> 44:04.192
Yeah, with beards.

44:04.193 --> 44:07.072
See, I need to be strong.
I have to force it.

44:08.552 --> 44:10.471
Aaaaaahhh!

44:10.472 --> 44:13.991
Slow down, man!
It's a marathon, not a sprint.

44:13.992 --> 44:17.151
There is nothing I can't do!

44:17.152 --> 44:18.472
Nothing!

44:20.472 --> 44:21.592
Ches?

44:23.432 --> 44:25.432
Ches, what you doing?

44:27.632 --> 44:30.191
What the fuck?
Chesney, what you doing?!

44:30.192 --> 44:32.152
Ches! Chesney!

44:36.792 --> 44:38.231
Hello?

44:38.232 --> 44:39.872
Eh! Manners!

45:01.792 --> 45:04.071
What do you think you're doing?
Fuck off!

45:04.072 --> 45:05.952
It's me!

45:08.952 --> 45:10.912
Still don't believe in you.

45:14.112 --> 45:17.431
'Some people think you should
embrace your mistakes,

45:17.432 --> 45:19.312
'make them part of you.

45:20.672 --> 45:23.792
'Why waste time and energy
feeling guilty? What's the point?

45:25.992 --> 45:27.992
'We're only human, after all.

45:32.832 --> 45:34.912
'Even those just starting out.

45:37.792 --> 45:41.311
'Thing about mistakes is,
when you're making them,

45:41.312 --> 45:43.551
'when you're in the middle of them,

45:43.552 --> 45:46.511
'they don't feel wrong.

45:46.512 --> 45:48.592
'Some even feel...

45:49.592 --> 45:51.072
'pretty good.'

45:52.832 --> 45:54.871
We need staff and we need 'em now.

45:54.872 --> 45:57.871
We can't advertise for 'em
in the evening news!

45:57.872 --> 46:00.310
One man for me - best-looking
man on the Chatsworth.

46:00.311 --> 46:01.392
It was a mistake.

46:01.393 --> 46:02.871
That happened twice.

46:02.872 --> 46:04.751
That won't happen again.

46:04.752 --> 46:07.311
New fella? You never said.

46:07.312 --> 46:08.831
Nothing special.

46:08.832 --> 46:10.552
Is everyone here
to see Lillian Tyler?

46:10.553 --> 46:12.351
The auditions for the whoring?

46:12.352 --> 46:14.672
I see a bright future for you two.
