01:03.606 --> 01:05.983
<i>Hey, John, you there?</i>

01:10.989 --> 01:12.782
<i>Yeah, go ahead.</i>

01:15.201 --> 01:17.746
<i>These animals are
in a terrible spot.</i>

01:21.374 --> 01:24.084
<i>We're gonna move 'em all
into a pasture that's safer.</i>

01:24.085 --> 01:25.545
<i>They'll be fine.</i>

01:28.548 --> 01:29.966
<i>Copy.</i>

01:42.562 --> 01:46.066
<i>Breaking news in Southern California.
Six major wildfires now.</i>

01:47.275 --> 01:49.444
John, what's going on?
Are you coming with us?

01:50.695 --> 01:53.072
<i>Molly, it's still
really far away.</i>

01:53.073 --> 01:55.157
<i>But just get prepared
in case, okay?</i>

01:55.158 --> 01:57.117
- Whoa.
- Oh, my God.

01:57.118 --> 02:00.329
There's fire
over there on that side.
There's fire down there.

02:00.330 --> 02:02.706
And then there's a fourth one
that's up that way.

02:02.707 --> 02:04.833
As soon as you're done this,
you guys can go.

02:12.717 --> 02:15.385
We're gonna move
the ewes and the lambs

02:15.386 --> 02:18.806
all together in 16,
and that's just one pasture.

02:18.807 --> 02:20.516
John, I'm not okay with this.

02:20.517 --> 02:22.684
I can see a lot of smoke
out the window.

02:22.685 --> 02:23.853
We're gonna go.

02:34.364 --> 02:38.118
<i>I never dreamed we could
even get to this point</i>

02:39.702 --> 02:41.996
<i>to have so much to lose.</i>

02:43.414 --> 02:45.291
<i>But... I was wrong.</i>

03:15.321 --> 03:17.740
Okay, guys, you're gonna
get knocked down.

03:18.199 --> 03:21.995
But just remember,
keep getting up
and keep moving forward.

03:26.666 --> 03:29.085
Look. She's not scared.

03:34.507 --> 03:37.594
<i>Everyone told us
this idea was crazy.</i>

03:42.891 --> 03:45.727
<i>That attempting to farm
in harmony with nature...</i>

03:47.478 --> 03:51.482
<i>would be reckless,
if not impossible.</i>

03:58.323 --> 04:02.242
<i>But what's crazier
is that this all started</i>

04:02.243 --> 04:04.954
<i>with a promise
we made to a dog.</i>

04:21.387 --> 04:25.182
Hi! So I'm doing
a scallop cook-off,

04:25.183 --> 04:28.727
and John ate all the ones
that I had already done.

04:28.728 --> 04:31.521
But they were so good.

04:31.522 --> 04:35.776
<i>John and I were living in a
tiny apartment in Santa Monica.</i>

04:35.777 --> 04:38.904
I just wanted everybody
to see how I started my day.

04:38.905 --> 04:42.574
Oh, he's still half asleep!

04:42.575 --> 04:46.536
<i>John was a cameraman
working on wildlife projects
all over the world.</i>

04:46.537 --> 04:49.915
I love these zucchinis,
'cause look how
they're all different shapes.

04:49.916 --> 04:53.126
<i>Molly was a private chef
and culinary blogger...</i>

04:53.127 --> 04:56.296
And the dense flesh
makes for a really nice soup.

04:56.297 --> 04:58.966
<i>...specializing in
the health benefits</i>

04:58.967 --> 05:01.760
<i>of more traditional
cooking methods.</i>

05:01.761 --> 05:04.304
Bone broths
are rich in gelatin,

05:04.305 --> 05:06.348
which supports
the digestion...

05:06.349 --> 05:09.810
<i>And she knew
an even deeper truth.</i>

05:09.811 --> 05:11.853
You know, the health
of our food

05:11.854 --> 05:14.189
is really determined
by how it's farmed.

05:18.695 --> 05:21.071
<i>We promised each other
that we'd build</i>

05:21.072 --> 05:23.157
<i>a life of purpose together.</i>

05:24.993 --> 05:27.869
<i>And there was no question
for Molly</i>

05:27.870 --> 05:32.124
<i>that we'd both find
plenty of purpose on a farm.</i>

05:32.125 --> 05:36.253
<i>But this farm would have
orchards, gardens, animals...</i>

05:36.254 --> 05:37.587
<i>Not just any farm.</i>

05:37.588 --> 05:39.798
<i>We're talking like something
out of a children's book.</i>

05:39.799 --> 05:42.801
<i>We would grow apricots
and peaches, plums,</i>

05:42.802 --> 05:46.388
<i>nectarines, cherries,
kumquats, grapefruits,
guava, limes...</i>

05:46.389 --> 05:48.598
<i>Her dream was literally to grow</i>

05:48.599 --> 05:50.809
<i>everything she could
possibly cook with.</i>

05:50.810 --> 05:53.020
<i>This vegetable garden,
it wouldn't be just
any vegetable garden.</i>

05:53.021 --> 05:55.188
<i>We would have
flowers, herbs...</i>

05:55.189 --> 05:56.690
<i>And we'd do all of this</i>

05:56.691 --> 05:58.358
<i>in perfect harmony
with nature.</i>

05:58.359 --> 06:00.778
<i>Thyme, rosemary,
oregano, basil...</i>

06:00.987 --> 06:03.447
<i>Like a traditional
farm from the past.</i>

06:03.448 --> 06:05.782
<i>Fennel, strawberries,
boysenberries,</i>

06:05.783 --> 06:07.951
<i>raspberries,
kale, broccoli...</i>

06:07.952 --> 06:09.912
<i>Sounded like a meaningful life.</i>

06:11.622 --> 06:14.416
<i>But our reality
was so far away</i>

06:14.417 --> 06:16.377
<i>from anything like a farm.</i>

06:19.756 --> 06:21.757
Okay, ready?
Go ahead.

06:21.758 --> 06:25.510
So I'm starting to get
the red tomatoes.

06:25.511 --> 06:28.013
<i>Her excitement for
food was infectious.</i>

06:28.014 --> 06:31.558
And that is my
September porch garden.

06:31.559 --> 06:35.563
<i>But I couldn't see any way
to make it happen...</i>

06:36.230 --> 06:38.857
Look, I've got these
little wasabi sprouts.

06:38.858 --> 06:43.404
<i>...until one day,
when we saved a life
that would change ours.</i>

06:49.202 --> 06:52.621
<i>I found myself filming
an animal hoarder for work.</i>

06:52.622 --> 06:55.332
<i>She had 200 dogs
in one house.</i>

06:55.333 --> 06:57.709
Buster, quiet.

06:57.710 --> 07:00.295
<i>And the county was about
to come take them all.</i>

07:00.296 --> 07:02.756
Hey, I like this guy.

07:02.757 --> 07:04.883
<i>That's where I met Todd.</i>

07:04.884 --> 07:06.927
Hey, buddy.

07:06.928 --> 07:09.012
<i>She kept him in a tiny pen
with these huge</i>

07:09.013 --> 07:12.099
<i>Great Pyrenees dogs
three times his size.</i>

07:12.100 --> 07:15.894
Molly, this one right here.
You see him?

07:15.895 --> 07:19.356
<i>Come on, John.
For real? Bad idea.</i>

07:19.357 --> 07:21.483
Yeah,
but look at his eyes.

07:21.484 --> 07:24.778
<i>Today, about 200 animals
have been removed
from a home near Tehachapi.</i>

07:24.779 --> 07:28.074
<i>Many of the dogs had
to be euthanized.</i>

07:29.700 --> 07:33.121
We had a baby.

07:37.583 --> 07:40.753
<i>Todd filled us
with purpose.</i>

07:44.173 --> 07:46.175
Are you gonna do anything fun?

07:51.347 --> 07:53.975
- What's he doing?
- Rollin' on his back.

07:55.268 --> 07:56.977
Roll over. Good.

07:56.978 --> 07:59.188
Shake. Chair.

08:00.523 --> 08:02.232
Speak.

08:02.233 --> 08:03.567
Good boy!

08:03.568 --> 08:05.986
<i>We made one promise to him.</i>

08:05.987 --> 08:09.156
<i>Our home
would be his last.</i>

08:10.992 --> 08:14.536
- <i>Hey, guys, this is Jacob from downstairs.
- The problem was...</i>

08:14.537 --> 08:17.831
<i>Your dog's been barking...
...if we left,
he would bark...</i>

08:17.832 --> 08:20.125
<i>...all day.
...nonstop for eight hours.</i>

08:20.126 --> 08:22.878
<i>Yeah.
We tried everything.</i>

08:22.879 --> 08:26.006
<i>We got Todd one of those
fancy LA dog trainers.</i>

08:26.007 --> 08:28.383
<i>If your dog's
an out-of-control barker,</i>

08:28.384 --> 08:30.177
<i>then this program
is for you.</i>

08:30.178 --> 08:32.929
- <i>Actually,
a couple of them.
- That didn't work.</i>

08:32.929 --> 08:35.640
<i>We got him
a citronella barking collar</i>

08:35.640 --> 08:38.727
<i>that sprays orange in his face
every time he barks.</i>

08:38.727 --> 08:41.229
<i>And when we got home, the whole
entire house smelled like oranges,</i>

08:41.230 --> 08:43.982
<i>and the canister was empty.</i>

08:43.982 --> 08:46.276
<i>Then we got him
this anxiety shirt</i>

08:46.277 --> 08:49.196
<i>that was supposed to
wrap around him
and make him really calm.</i>

08:49.197 --> 08:51.323
<i>That was the day
he tore the carpet up.</i>

08:51.324 --> 08:54.618
<i>Oh, and remember you even
tried that service vest</i>

08:54.619 --> 08:56.454
<i>so that you could
take him everywhere?</i>

08:57.413 --> 09:01.124
Oh, man, Todd.
This is so wrong.

09:01.125 --> 09:03.835
<i>We sensed it was coming.</i>

09:03.836 --> 09:05.338
<i>The landlord called.</i>

09:06.506 --> 09:08.758
<i>Todd had to go.</i>

09:12.178 --> 09:16.473
<i>Moving to another apartment
wouldn't stop Todd's barking.</i>

09:16.474 --> 09:19.559
<i>We couldn't just give up on him.</i>

09:19.560 --> 09:23.355
<i>And then it hit us.</i>

09:26.817 --> 09:29.946
<i>Molly's dream could be
the answer to everything.</i>

09:31.030 --> 09:32.698
<i>We had a great idea</i>

09:34.450 --> 09:37.536
<i>with no way to pay for it.</i>

09:39.163 --> 09:41.790
<i>So we read every farming
book we could find.</i>

09:41.791 --> 09:43.416
<i>Cold-called old farmers.</i>

09:43.417 --> 09:45.377
<i>And we drew up a business plan.</i>

09:45.378 --> 09:48.588
<i>It was time to find an investor.</i>

09:48.589 --> 09:51.216
<i>But first,
we shared our vision</i>

09:51.217 --> 09:53.885
<i>with our closest friends
and family.</i>

09:56.013 --> 09:59.516
<i>Old MacMolly had a farm</i>

09:59.517 --> 10:01.977
<i>E-I-E-I-O</i>

10:01.978 --> 10:03.603
<i>Yeah, they made fun of us.</i>

10:03.604 --> 10:06.648
<i>With an oink-oink here
And an oink-oink there</i>

10:06.649 --> 10:09.234
It's a long story.

10:09.235 --> 10:13.113
<i>But it worked, because one
person told another person...</i>

10:13.114 --> 10:17.450
<i>And the word of our dream
spread and spread.</i>

10:17.451 --> 10:20.829
<i>Until it eventually connected
us to some investors</i>

10:20.830 --> 10:25.333
<i>who actually saw
this old way of farming
as the future.</i>

10:27.086 --> 10:30.089
<i>All we needed was a farm.</i>

10:34.802 --> 10:36.636
The apple orchard could go here.

10:36.637 --> 10:38.763
And we need a lot of
different kinds of chickens.

10:38.764 --> 10:41.600
- We need to find a spot for cherimoya.
- Yeah.

10:41.601 --> 10:44.728
And over there, I saw
a perfect spot for a garden.

10:44.729 --> 10:48.024
- I wonder if we can grow bananas.
- Oh, my God.

10:51.235 --> 10:52.778
Come on, Todd.

10:54.572 --> 10:56.823
Here we are.

10:56.824 --> 10:59.327
Apricot Lane Farms.

11:00.453 --> 11:03.163
There's Todd runnin' by,

11:03.164 --> 11:05.166
the happiest dog
in the world.

11:06.584 --> 11:09.085
<i>Molly's bold vision
has landed us</i>

11:09.086 --> 11:12.130
<i>on over 200 acres of</i>

11:12.131 --> 11:14.341
<i>somewhat neglected land</i>

11:14.342 --> 11:17.053
<i>about an hour north
of Los Angeles.</i>

11:22.600 --> 11:24.309
Looks like
what used to be

11:24.310 --> 11:26.937
an old irrigation pond
or something.

11:29.899 --> 11:32.442
- <i>To Todd, it was perfect.</i>
- Todd, come here!

11:32.443 --> 11:34.653
Come on. Yeah!

11:34.654 --> 11:38.073
Molly, look.
It's a beehive.

11:38.074 --> 11:41.827
- Man, they're all dead.
- Oh.

11:43.204 --> 11:46.624
<i>It didn't quite have
an abundant feeling of life,</i>

11:47.667 --> 11:50.127
<i>yet not much
around here does.</i>

11:53.297 --> 11:57.635
<i>We're surrounded
by these large-scale
monoculture-type farms.</i>

11:58.844 --> 12:01.346
<i>To our north, the ruins</i>

12:01.347 --> 12:04.767
<i>of the largest
indoor egg operation
in the world.</i>

12:07.395 --> 12:11.357
<i>Egg City once housed
3.5 million chickens,</i>

12:11.524 --> 12:14.193
<i>laying about
two million eggs a day.</i>

12:16.195 --> 12:18.446
<i>To our west,</i>

12:18.447 --> 12:22.951
<i>miles of red raspberries
growing under plastic
hoop houses.</i>

12:22.952 --> 12:26.538
<i>And I guess this is what
farming has become,</i>

12:26.539 --> 12:28.791
<i>so that farmers
can make a living.</i>

12:29.709 --> 12:31.501
<i>And the farm we're on</i>

12:31.502 --> 12:34.379
<i>followed a similar
monocrop-type approach.</i>

12:34.380 --> 12:38.425
<i>They were really only
growing lemons and avocados.</i>

12:38.426 --> 12:41.886
<i>So it's pretty clear
that our plan for a farm</i>

12:41.887 --> 12:44.348
<i>is way outside
of the norm.</i>

12:48.018 --> 12:50.437
So, how long you
been beekeepin'?

12:50.438 --> 12:52.480
Forty-eight years.

12:52.481 --> 12:55.734
Whoa. You ever been
out here before?

12:55.735 --> 12:58.654
Nope.
So what do you
think killed 'em?

13:03.701 --> 13:05.703
How long
you been doin' this?

13:07.079 --> 13:08.581
Beekeeping?

13:11.250 --> 13:13.626
This is
what we're fighting.

13:13.627 --> 13:16.130
It doesn't smash.

13:17.173 --> 13:18.923
<i>The soil was dead,</i>

13:18.924 --> 13:23.595
<i>and we had no idea
how to bring it back to life.</i>

13:23.596 --> 13:26.431
<i>And worse yet,
every other farmer</i>

13:26.432 --> 13:29.810
<i>we've mentioned Molly's
dream farm idea to</i>

13:31.020 --> 13:33.563
<i>thinks we're crazy.</i>

13:33.564 --> 13:37.860
Consultant for
traditional farming...

13:41.947 --> 13:44.032
- Okay, anytime.
- <i>She was like, "Hey, John,</i>

13:44.033 --> 13:48.495
<i>"this guy named Alan York
is coming today
to give us some advice."</i>

13:48.496 --> 13:51.165
Are there any questions?

13:52.458 --> 13:55.335
<i>He's like this
world-renowned expert</i>

13:55.336 --> 13:58.129
<i>in traditional
farming practices.</i>

13:58.130 --> 14:01.133
<i>And he shows up
wearing all linen</i>

14:01.300 --> 14:03.010
<i>and sandals.</i>

14:03.260 --> 14:07.430
I can't even...
Get in an inch.

14:07.431 --> 14:10.850
<i>But there was
this emphatic cadence
to his speech</i>

14:10.851 --> 14:13.102
<i>that made him sound
believable.</i>

14:13.103 --> 14:15.356
This is devil weed.

14:15.731 --> 14:17.565
By the end of the day,

14:17.566 --> 14:21.486
you will have such hate
for this plant

14:21.487 --> 14:25.114
that you'll
burn that stuff, man,
as if it's a ritual.

14:25.115 --> 14:28.952
Oh, Molly, here's another
of my favorite plants.

14:28.953 --> 14:30.662
Puncture weed.
What does that do?

14:30.663 --> 14:32.455
Look. Just grab a hold...
Ooh!

14:32.456 --> 14:34.541
Do you love it?
No.

14:34.542 --> 14:37.460
Wow, Molly.

14:37.461 --> 14:38.962
You don't love it.
I hate it.

14:40.339 --> 14:43.132
<i>Molly thinks he's great.</i>
Molly.

14:43.133 --> 14:46.094
<i>But his goal for the farm...</i>
This is your filter.
Pour it through it.

14:46.095 --> 14:48.638
<i>...sounds almost
too good to be true.</i>

14:48.639 --> 14:51.724
The objective is
to emulate

14:51.725 --> 14:54.185
how natural
ecosystems work.

14:54.186 --> 14:57.730
<i>They regulate themselves
through diversity.</i>

14:57.731 --> 15:02.151
So you don't get epidemics
of pests and disease.

15:02.152 --> 15:06.699
<i>The natural ecosystem right now is
in the middle of a record drought,</i>

15:07.533 --> 15:09.284
<i>so to build a life here,</i>

15:09.285 --> 15:11.995
<i>we have to rely entirely</i>

15:11.996 --> 15:15.040
<i>on a finite source of water
from our well.</i>

15:15.791 --> 15:17.876
Okay, Molly, you ready?

15:17.877 --> 15:21.046
Here we go.
Irrigation's comin' on.
All right.

15:24.091 --> 15:25.676
Whoo!

15:31.849 --> 15:34.851
Shoot. John, it's barely
comin' out.

15:34.852 --> 15:37.186
Well, it's goin'
somewhere.

15:37.187 --> 15:41.065
<i>Alan promised that
farming in this way...</i>

15:41.066 --> 15:42.817
It just shut off.

15:42.818 --> 15:45.487
<i>...will eventually
feel like surfing.</i>

15:48.240 --> 15:49.825
Found the broken line.

15:50.993 --> 15:53.494
<i>This feels nothing
like surfing.</i>

15:53.495 --> 15:57.373
Oh, boy. So, we tried
to irrigate our pastures,

15:57.374 --> 15:58.958
and when
we turned on the well...

15:58.959 --> 16:01.420
- You should probably turn it off.
- Okay, I hear you.

16:04.798 --> 16:08.051
<i>Alan didn't really care
about watering the pastures.</i>

16:08.052 --> 16:11.012
<i>He was more focused
on starting over</i>

16:11.013 --> 16:13.097
<i>with everything.</i>

16:13.098 --> 16:16.726
Where can we get rid
of things that should have
never been planted?

16:16.727 --> 16:20.314
<i>That opens up the opportunity
to diversify.</i>

16:25.277 --> 16:28.196
<i>We ripped out
55 acres of old trees.</i>

16:28.197 --> 16:31.324
<i>We built compost piles.</i>

16:31.325 --> 16:34.452
<i>To make money,
we need to be growing crops,</i>

16:34.453 --> 16:36.871
<i>and all we're doing is
ripping the crops out.</i>

16:36.872 --> 16:37.957
Burn it!

16:40.751 --> 16:43.294
<i>We restored an old pond.</i>

16:43.295 --> 16:46.005
<i>We fixed over five miles
of irrigation.</i>

16:46.006 --> 16:48.508
<i>Alan convinced us to build</i>

16:48.509 --> 16:51.719
<i>a state-of-the-art
worm compost facility,</i>

16:51.720 --> 16:55.139
<i>which is essentially
an oversized palace</i>

16:55.140 --> 16:57.058
<i>for collecting worm poop,</i>

16:57.059 --> 17:01.104
<i>what he called
the holy grail of soil food.</i>

17:01.105 --> 17:05.900
<i>And then we're gonna
brew this poop into a tea</i>

17:05.901 --> 17:07.986
<i>and feed it to our soil.</i>

17:07.987 --> 17:11.823
<i>We've blown through the first
year's budget in six months,</i>

17:11.824 --> 17:14.701
<i>and we haven't even
planted a single crop.</i>

17:14.702 --> 17:16.994
<i>You know, we have a
saying in the South,</i>

17:16.996 --> 17:19.039
<i>"Never enough time
to do it right,</i>

17:20.708 --> 17:22.916
"but always enough time
to do it over."

17:22.917 --> 17:25.921
- That's pretty good.
- Barely.

17:26.630 --> 17:28.966
Okay. All right.

17:31.593 --> 17:34.971
<i>We hired two guys,
Flavio and Raul.</i>

17:34.972 --> 17:38.391
<i>Raul had been on this farm
since he was 14 years old</i>

17:38.392 --> 17:40.936
<i>and has actually worked
through five of its owners.</i>

17:43.188 --> 17:46.149
<i>Oh, and two of those owners
were the banks</i>

17:46.150 --> 17:48.860
<i>that foreclosed on the farm
when it failed.</i>

17:48.861 --> 17:51.320
<i>But at least
he knows the farm.</i>

17:52.573 --> 17:56.659
<i>Flavio grew up on his father's
thousand-acre farm in Mexico.</i>

17:56.660 --> 18:00.788
<i>He brought some experience,
but our plan would require
more hands.</i>

18:00.789 --> 18:01.873
Come on, Todd.

18:01.874 --> 18:05.877
"Come join us."
<i>So, Molly got back
on the Internet.</i>

18:05.878 --> 18:08.546
"Traditional farm."

18:08.547 --> 18:10.382
<i>And it worked.</i>

18:12.134 --> 18:15.720
<i>We had young people
from all over the world</i>

18:15.721 --> 18:18.932
<i>coming to learn how to farm,
just like us.</i>

18:19.391 --> 18:21.935
You want to dig in at an angle
and just let the stuff fall down.

18:22.352 --> 18:24.521
Yeah, exactly like that.

18:24.688 --> 18:27.190
We were shoveling weeds
into the trailer
and I saw movement,

18:27.191 --> 18:30.359
<i>and there's a tiny
little newborn baby.</i>

18:30.360 --> 18:31.570
Oh, he's tryin' to hide.

18:32.488 --> 18:33.821
Too much excitement
for one day.

18:33.822 --> 18:35.823
Aw!

18:35.824 --> 18:40.120
We're finally ready to refill
the old irrigation pond.

18:48.754 --> 18:52.632
Go ahead, Maria.
Enjoy your new home, little catfish.

18:52.633 --> 18:56.052
We are adding
the very first worms
to the 40-foot

18:56.053 --> 18:58.638
Apricot Lane Farms bin.

19:00.891 --> 19:03.684
Whoo!

19:03.685 --> 19:05.312
All right, Molly,
open that baby up.

19:08.232 --> 19:10.192
Whoo-hoo!

19:12.402 --> 19:14.571
All right!
We are compost tea-ing!

19:15.322 --> 19:18.450
You introduced us
to all of these things.

19:24.832 --> 19:26.500
<i>Plants build soil.</i>

19:29.002 --> 19:33.340
If there's no plants,
there will never be
any fertility.

19:34.466 --> 19:37.301
<i>We planted
tons of new trees,</i>

19:37.302 --> 19:41.139
<i>we seeded cover crop,
dug culverts
to prevent runoff,</i>

19:41.140 --> 19:45.184
<i>turned a horse arena
into a garden,
planted natives and other...</i>

19:45.185 --> 19:47.103
<i>The list went on for pages.
Built chicken coops.</i>

19:47.104 --> 19:50.899
<i>Every time I crossed
something off my list,
10 more things went on.</i>

19:56.113 --> 19:58.948
<i>Our goal is the highest level</i>

19:58.949 --> 20:01.909
- of biodiversity possible.
- Got it.

20:01.910 --> 20:04.036
<i>And we took that literally.</i>

20:04.037 --> 20:06.205
The post office called
us at what time?

20:06.206 --> 20:07.874
5:30.

20:07.875 --> 20:09.334
For this.

20:12.004 --> 20:15.548
They're the cutest things
I've ever seen!

20:15.549 --> 20:17.800
What do you think
of this, Todd?

20:17.801 --> 20:20.970
Why are you so mean?

20:20.971 --> 20:22.638
<i>It was like every animal</i>

20:22.639 --> 20:24.224
<i>you'd see
in a children's book.</i>

20:25.058 --> 20:26.684
<i>Each...</i>

20:26.685 --> 20:28.270
<i>...with a purpose
to contribute.</i>

20:30.189 --> 20:33.149
One hundred baby ducks.

20:33.150 --> 20:35.985
<i>It was everything that
we had ever talked about.</i>

20:35.986 --> 20:37.778
I can hardly stand it!

20:40.365 --> 20:42.909
Yay! We own a bull!

20:48.582 --> 20:50.542
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

20:52.794 --> 20:56.923
Presenting Caya and Rosie,
our livestock guardian dogs.

20:56.924 --> 20:58.633
Well... One day.

20:58.634 --> 21:01.177
Molly and John are
very happy about this,

21:01.178 --> 21:03.387
but Todd is not.

21:03.388 --> 21:05.890
He won't even look at us.

21:05.891 --> 21:07.725
Here's the new chicken house.

21:07.726 --> 21:09.685
There are some chickens
over there.

21:09.686 --> 21:13.064
And the sheep like
the chicken house, too.

21:13.065 --> 21:15.191
What do you think, chickens?

21:15.192 --> 21:16.525
Why?

21:16.526 --> 21:19.070
What are you guys
doing in my office?

21:19.071 --> 21:21.531
Oh, boy.

21:22.032 --> 21:23.283
Poor Todd.

21:24.576 --> 21:26.828
Back with
Great Pyrenees again.

21:30.958 --> 21:32.834
<i>Their poop is our gold.</i>

21:33.460 --> 21:37.380
<i>It's as valuable as a crop.</i>

21:37.381 --> 21:39.548
<i>And now you can build compost</i>

21:39.549 --> 21:43.344
<i>that is of very high quality.</i>

21:43.345 --> 21:46.138
<i>The animals,
compost and cover crops</i>

21:46.139 --> 21:48.099
<i>all share the same goal,</i>

21:48.100 --> 21:50.893
<i>to bring our soil
back to life,</i>

21:50.894 --> 21:55.482
<i>infusing it with a host
of beneficial microorganisms.</i>

21:56.858 --> 21:58.651
<i>I just hope it works,</i>

21:58.652 --> 22:02.029
<i>because Alan said
without the microorganisms,</i>

22:02.030 --> 22:05.032
<i>our way of farming
won't work at all.</i>

22:05.033 --> 22:08.327
How's it going, Josh?
Every now and then,
when you hit it with the hose,

22:08.328 --> 22:11.414
you get a nice
face full of...

22:11.415 --> 22:14.583
- Come.
- Get in there, Todd.

22:14.584 --> 22:17.461
<i>We had everything on the farm
we could have ever wanted.</i>

22:17.462 --> 22:19.922
That's it.
They went through that fast.

22:19.923 --> 22:22.091
<i>But we were missing something</i>

22:22.092 --> 22:24.094
<i>that every real farm needs.</i>

22:25.387 --> 22:28.640
<i>And the day she arrived,
the farm felt complete.</i>

22:32.978 --> 22:35.563
<i>She came to us pregnant,</i>

22:35.564 --> 22:39.026
<i>but also with
horrible diarrhea.</i>
Ugh!

22:39.568 --> 22:43.070
<i>And the only thing worse
was the name she came with,</i>

22:43.071 --> 22:45.156
<i>Ugly Betty,</i>

22:45.157 --> 22:48.869
<i>which we quickly changed
to Emma.</i>

22:49.661 --> 22:52.538
Oh, man, she pooped
everywhere in here.

22:52.539 --> 22:55.834
<i>When it comes to
the care of our animals,</i>

22:56.209 --> 22:58.753
<i>I've begun to realize
that there's really</i>

22:58.754 --> 23:02.048
<i>only one thing
that Alan knows about them.</i>

23:02.049 --> 23:06.427
You need animals
for a farm to be healthy.

23:06.428 --> 23:07.971
<i>And that's it.</i>

23:16.229 --> 23:19.023
The only way
she'll eat her greens
is if we douse it

23:19.024 --> 23:22.402
in a soaked-grain
apple cider vinegar dressing.

23:25.572 --> 23:27.449
How come
you don't like oranges?

23:29.618 --> 23:31.870
<i>Her first contribution
to the farm was</i>

23:32.746 --> 23:35.540
<i>destroying our pastures</i>

23:36.875 --> 23:38.960
<i>and wasting water.</i>

23:40.003 --> 23:41.922
<i>But she knew
what she was doing.</i>

23:43.590 --> 23:45.300
<i>She was making the farm</i>

23:48.428 --> 23:49.679
<i>her home.</i>

24:03.360 --> 24:06.445
<i>We're a year in
and Molly and Alan</i>

24:06.446 --> 24:09.990
<i>still have one
20-acre orchard to plant.</i>

24:09.991 --> 24:12.786
<i>I only suggested
three fruit tree varieties.</i>

24:13.829 --> 24:17.207
<i>But Alan is making
this farm so complicated.</i>

24:18.250 --> 24:21.753
<i>I feel like we're gonna be
reliant on him forever.</i>

24:23.422 --> 24:25.966
<i>We call it the fruit basket.</i>

24:27.342 --> 24:30.095
<i>Seventy-five different
varieties of stone fruit.</i>

24:31.680 --> 24:34.807
<i>Plums, peaches, nectarines,
cherries, apricots...</i>

24:34.808 --> 24:38.561
You may think
it's a crazy idea,

24:38.562 --> 24:41.231
and it very well may be,

24:42.399 --> 24:44.817
<i>but, diversify,
diversify, diversify.</i>

24:44.818 --> 24:47.988
<i>That's the link
to the whole thing.</i>

24:52.993 --> 24:54.661
Are there piglets?

24:57.581 --> 24:58.748
Good job, Emma.

25:00.959 --> 25:02.585
How many do you think
she'll have?

25:02.586 --> 25:05.839
They said, like,
maybe eight or 10,
but she's pretty small.

25:07.924 --> 25:11.261
Five? Is that
gonna be the end?

25:13.680 --> 25:16.640
She seems like
she might be done.

25:16.641 --> 25:18.602
If she stops now,
I'd be good.

25:20.645 --> 25:21.938
Uh-oh.

25:23.607 --> 25:24.982
She's pushing again.

25:27.194 --> 25:29.278
Seven?

25:29.279 --> 25:30.697
Already ready to run.

25:31.698 --> 25:33.574
Nine!
Yeah.

25:33.575 --> 25:35.368
I'm startin' to get
a little nervous now.

25:36.578 --> 25:39.538
- Another one.
- Okay.

25:39.539 --> 25:41.790
Oh, it's big.

25:41.791 --> 25:44.835
Wait. Is that 11?
I don't know. I lost count.

25:44.836 --> 25:46.962
There's another?
This is crazy.

25:46.963 --> 25:50.383
Another one?
Oh, geez, no.

25:52.302 --> 25:55.054
- How many is that now?
- I do believe we've hit a dozen.

25:55.055 --> 25:58.475
How did she have room?
She was so skinny.
I don't understand.

25:58.642 --> 26:01.519
Yes, but you've been
feeding her well
for the last couple days.

26:01.520 --> 26:05.273
Oh, no.
Another one? She's created
a few more.

26:07.317 --> 26:09.026
She knows what to do.

26:09.027 --> 26:12.321
Oh, no. Oh, my God.

26:12.322 --> 26:13.989
Are you serious?

26:13.990 --> 26:16.200
Oh, my goodness.

26:16.201 --> 26:18.495
- This is so fun!
- I love our life!

26:19.829 --> 26:21.789
Have you washed
your hands, John?

26:21.790 --> 26:23.749
Wow.

26:23.750 --> 26:26.627
- Oh, there's 14.
- Oh, my gosh.

26:26.628 --> 26:29.964
- We're in a lot of trouble.
- Another one. Oh, my gosh.

26:29.965 --> 26:32.967
I think we're
officially pig farmers.

26:32.968 --> 26:35.971
- Hey, John, another one.
- No.

26:38.974 --> 26:43.060
John, please be careful.

26:43.061 --> 26:45.271
<i>I'm not sure
when the moment is</i>

26:45.272 --> 26:48.858
<i>that you actually feel
like you've earned
the title of "farmer."</i>

26:50.944 --> 26:53.154
Uh-oh. What?

26:53.405 --> 26:55.322
Oh, my God.

26:55.323 --> 26:56.865
Oh... Hey!

26:56.866 --> 27:00.161
<i>Each day still feels
both terrifying</i>

27:01.371 --> 27:03.539
<i>and magically unpredictable.</i>

27:03.540 --> 27:08.294
This is an abnormally
large chicken egg,

27:08.295 --> 27:11.005
<i>and we are gonna crack it
to find out</i>

27:11.006 --> 27:13.842
what kind of surprises
are inside.

27:15.176 --> 27:17.219
Another egg!

27:20.432 --> 27:22.391
That's amazing.

27:22.392 --> 27:24.561
It was an egg in an egg.

27:25.270 --> 27:26.896
Oh, hi, Scissor Beak.

27:27.147 --> 27:30.609
<i>We didn't expect this to be
our first breakthrough.</i>

27:30.900 --> 27:33.778
<i>They line up at stores
waiting for our delivery.</i>

27:34.487 --> 27:38.199
<i>Fifty dozen sell out
in less than an hour.</i>

27:39.284 --> 27:41.536
<i>Literally fighting over them.</i>

27:42.579 --> 27:44.080
<i>We're onto something.</i>

27:46.166 --> 27:49.085
<i>So, we got a lot more.</i>

27:53.173 --> 27:54.841
Aw!

27:59.262 --> 28:02.474
<i>We're farming over
200 different things.</i>

28:03.892 --> 28:07.311
<i>And Alan claims that
all of this diversity</i>

28:07.312 --> 28:10.815
<i>will somehow
lead to simplicity.</i>

28:13.068 --> 28:15.527
The flywheel is being built,

28:15.528 --> 28:18.739
<i>so now it becomes
self-perpetuating</i>

28:18.740 --> 28:21.575
<i>and self-regulating.</i>

28:21.576 --> 28:25.120
<i>So I picture this
circle, full of life,</i>

28:25.121 --> 28:28.582
<i>with plants,
livestock, wildlife,</i>

28:28.583 --> 28:31.085
<i>all working together,</i>

28:31.086 --> 28:34.880
<i>pushing us forward,
building our soil,</i>

28:34.881 --> 28:37.174
<i>living in harmony.</i>

28:37.175 --> 28:38.802
<i>That would be great.</i>

28:40.220 --> 28:43.847
<i>Always you're looking for
opportunities to integrate,</i>

28:43.848 --> 28:47.143
<i>so that everything
works in harmony.</i>

28:49.104 --> 28:51.815
<i>For example,
we've established cover crops</i>

28:52.691 --> 28:54.859
<i>to rebuild our soil.</i>

28:55.652 --> 28:57.236
<i>The problem,</i>

28:57.237 --> 28:59.489
<i>this requires
more labor to mow them.</i>

29:00.573 --> 29:03.867
<i>But Alan quickly
shifted our lens,</i>

29:03.868 --> 29:07.747
<i>calling it a problem
with an opportunity.</i>

29:10.500 --> 29:14.295
<i>That cover crop
is food for our sheep.</i>

29:15.672 --> 29:18.883
<i>And then, the X factor.</i>

29:20.218 --> 29:22.219
<i>As they trample the grass,</i>

29:22.220 --> 29:25.598
<i>they leave behind
their droppings and urine.</i>

29:26.516 --> 29:29.351
It all circles back

29:29.352 --> 29:31.604
to the health of the soil.

29:41.656 --> 29:44.324
<i>We're entering a
phase of regeneration</i>

29:44.325 --> 29:46.536
<i>beyond just simply farming.</i>

29:48.705 --> 29:50.914
<i>Intermixed among our animals,</i>

29:50.915 --> 29:54.794
<i>the delicate wildlife
is returning to our land.</i>

30:00.967 --> 30:04.429
<i>The farm is becoming
a habitat for them, too.</i>

30:45.178 --> 30:48.847
<i>The trick will be
to balance the needs
of the farm</i>

30:48.848 --> 30:50.517
<i>with that
of the wildlife,</i>

30:51.559 --> 30:55.647
<i>something Alan has
encouraged from the beginning.</i>

31:01.194 --> 31:03.738
- You found all these around the pump?
- Yeah.

31:06.616 --> 31:07.784
Coyote.

31:10.787 --> 31:12.663
How many did they get?

31:12.664 --> 31:14.499
About a dozen.

31:15.208 --> 31:18.335
We need to put up an
electric fence or something,

31:18.336 --> 31:20.296
so they can make it
to the house.

31:20.463 --> 31:23.924
<i>I know I've got some neighbors
who would probably
shoot a coyote</i>

31:23.925 --> 31:26.094
<i>for chewing
an irrigation line,</i>

31:26.636 --> 31:31.057
<i>but we're trying to figure out
what beneficial role
the coyote plays here.</i>

31:32.058 --> 31:34.476
I feel it's very humane

31:34.477 --> 31:37.062
to try to prevent us
from having to kill them.

31:37.063 --> 31:40.899
Well, if we make it
difficult for the coyote
to kill the ducks,

31:40.900 --> 31:43.152
it'll figure out
another way
to get some food.

31:45.113 --> 31:47.907
You know, it's at least
worth trying again.
Yeah.

31:50.368 --> 31:53.078
So now with the fence
running all the way
to the pond,

31:53.079 --> 31:55.790
hopefully it'll give
the ducks a chance
to get inside.

31:57.500 --> 31:58.793
It's working
with the chickens.

32:03.965 --> 32:06.050
<i>"It's a simple way of farming."</i>

32:06.926 --> 32:08.636
<i>That's what
Alan always says.</i>

32:09.846 --> 32:11.472
<i>It's just not easy.</i>

32:11.973 --> 32:16.853
<i>In his own way, I think
he's always been honest
with us about that.</i>

32:18.980 --> 32:21.857
<i>But today we learned
about something</i>

32:21.858 --> 32:24.319
<i>that Alan had been
keeping from us.</i>

32:25.153 --> 32:26.945
<i>Molly, it's Alan.</i>

32:26.946 --> 32:29.949
<i>Can you please give me a call
when you get a chance?</i>

32:31.868 --> 32:35.872
<i>Apparently, he's been fighting
an aggressive form of cancer.</i>

32:45.340 --> 32:49.177
<i>I don't think he's feeling
up to visiting the farm.</i>

32:49.802 --> 32:53.014
<i>It feels like the ground has
just dropped from beneath us.</i>

32:54.015 --> 32:58.352
<i>And on top of that,
we're starting to face
all these new problems</i>

32:58.353 --> 33:01.772
<i>that we just don't have
the answers for.</i>

33:01.773 --> 33:03.273
Wait, wait. Are you talking
about what happened

33:03.274 --> 33:05.151
in the front valley
or somewhere else?

33:05.610 --> 33:09.322
<i>No, no. I'm talking
about the pig, Emma.</i>

33:11.741 --> 33:14.952
Okay. Let me go down
to the valley first and see
what's going on there,

33:14.953 --> 33:16.871
and then I'll come
to you guys.

33:19.832 --> 33:22.293
There's no way
this was one coyote.

33:25.713 --> 33:28.632
The coyotes
figured out how to

33:28.633 --> 33:31.135
pull this wire open.

33:32.011 --> 33:33.638
Went inside and...

33:38.017 --> 33:39.852
They're all over
the place.

33:53.157 --> 33:56.327
Seventeen, 18, 19, 20.
And then there's 10
in the truck.

33:59.163 --> 34:01.331
<i>Thirty chickens?</i>

34:01.332 --> 34:04.668
Yeah, 30. And now
I'm heading down
to meet Flavio,

34:04.669 --> 34:07.046
because apparently
there's something wrong
with Emma.

34:07.755 --> 34:09.716
<i>Wait, what happened
to Emma?</i>

34:14.387 --> 34:17.848
She's definitely got a fever.
It's like 106.9. It's high.

34:17.849 --> 34:19.641
<i>Uh-huh.
Right. Uh-huh.</i>

34:19.641 --> 34:22.351
All of her udders
are hard on the topside.

34:22.353 --> 34:23.980
<i>Mastitis.</i>
Yeah.

34:24.272 --> 34:25.940
You know, she ended up
having 17.

34:26.315 --> 34:29.317
<i>Probably that litter size
that did it.</i>

34:29.318 --> 34:34.031
<i>We'll knock that fever down
so she doesn't cook her brain,</i>

34:34.032 --> 34:36.159
<i>and then just pray.</i>

34:41.998 --> 34:43.916
Maybe let's take
the babies away.

35:09.776 --> 35:11.486
Septicemia.

35:21.704 --> 35:23.413
<i>Rampant infection.</i>

35:23.414 --> 35:26.666
<i>Over 50% of cases
are caused by</i>

35:26.667 --> 35:28.836
<i>gram-positive organisms.</i>

35:52.819 --> 35:54.904
You got
her fever down, right?

35:56.155 --> 35:57.198
Yeah.

35:57.865 --> 36:00.451
But if she doesn't eat soon,
she's gonna die.

36:16.342 --> 36:18.177
<i>Flavio to John.</i>

36:26.853 --> 36:29.438
I never see something like that.

36:31.983 --> 36:33.151
What happened?

36:35.111 --> 36:38.573
The intestines come out
from the baby.
Oh, man.

36:38.948 --> 36:40.283
It's bad.

36:46.622 --> 36:49.667
It's like a herniated
umbilical cord or something.

36:49.959 --> 36:52.128
I'm gonna have to
put her down.

37:09.854 --> 37:11.689
Just set her down here.

37:24.452 --> 37:26.787
If nothing else,
it's a little more
water for her.

37:30.583 --> 37:32.376
You gotta eat, Emma.

37:39.091 --> 37:43.429
<i>It's all, like,
this slow disillusionment</i>

37:43.971 --> 37:46.557
<i>of our earnest intent.</i>

37:49.185 --> 37:54.273
<i>Intent alone
is not a protector.</i>

38:13.209 --> 38:16.045
<i>I've run out of ways
to get Emma to eat.</i>

38:17.255 --> 38:19.757
<i>She needs to decide
if she wants to live.</i>

38:25.972 --> 38:27.723
Now they're puttin' them in.

38:43.781 --> 38:47.117
I don't know.
She seems excited.

38:51.330 --> 38:52.665
Come on.

39:00.589 --> 39:02.008
Good girl.

39:09.890 --> 39:12.643
You're, like, moving
every piece of lettuce
out of the way.

39:15.354 --> 39:17.273
You're such a finicky pig.

39:30.077 --> 39:32.078
<i>In trying to save
the animals</i>

39:32.079 --> 39:34.874
<i>that will one day
become food,</i>

39:37.209 --> 39:41.589
<i>it naturally develops
this bond.</i>

39:45.468 --> 39:49.388
<i>And that's not something
I've fully processed.</i>

40:11.410 --> 40:14.120
I think I'm okay.

40:14.121 --> 40:16.207
But this is
a swarm of bees.

40:19.418 --> 40:21.379
I can see
why they're showing up.

40:22.713 --> 40:24.589
Take a look at this place.

40:24.590 --> 40:29.719
It's a 500% improvement
compared to where it was
when we first come out here.

40:47.571 --> 40:51.241
I've never seen bees
swarm to one spot
like this before.

40:51.242 --> 40:53.284
This is definitely
a good sign.

40:59.750 --> 41:02.085
They showed up at the
perfect time, huh?

41:02.086 --> 41:04.879
Looks like the fruit trees
are pretty happy, too.

41:04.880 --> 41:05.965
Yeah, right?

41:17.935 --> 41:19.687
<i>The fruit basket.</i>

41:20.646 --> 41:22.856
<i>It's an important orchard</i>

41:22.857 --> 41:25.818
<i>because of the rare
and unique varieties,</i>

41:26.527 --> 41:29.488
<i>and that's what's
gonna give us
an edge at the market.</i>

41:35.661 --> 41:37.830
<i>As we enter
into our third spring,</i>

41:38.539 --> 41:41.083
<i>it's truly become
a paradise.</i>

41:44.003 --> 41:47.423
<i>I can see now
why Alan pushed for this.</i>

41:54.305 --> 41:56.098
Looks like starlings.

41:57.349 --> 41:59.560
Yeah.
That's what I think, too.

42:40.142 --> 42:43.395
- We lost almost 70% of the fruit.
- Oh, my gosh.

42:44.480 --> 42:46.482
We are feeding the birds.

42:50.236 --> 42:54.073
<i>Alan told us that things like
this would eventually balance out.</i>

42:55.908 --> 42:59.036
<i>I'm just not clear on
how that's supposed to happen.</i>

43:05.793 --> 43:08.294
<i>At the tone,
please record your message.</i>

43:08.295 --> 43:10.380
Hey, Alan, it's Molly.

43:10.381 --> 43:12.925
I was just calling
to see how you're doing.

43:13.175 --> 43:15.594
So, we're all
thinking of you here.

43:16.262 --> 43:17.805
Okay, take care.

43:21.600 --> 43:23.310
Hey, Caya, stop!

43:24.937 --> 43:26.188
Caya!

43:30.609 --> 43:34.195
<i>I guess I don't know what
Alan's idea of a perfect harmony</i>

43:34.196 --> 43:36.907
<i>is even supposed
to look like,</i>

43:38.200 --> 43:41.536
<i>because every step we take
to improve our land</i>

43:41.537 --> 43:45.457
<i>seems to just create
the perfect habitat
for the next pest.</i>

43:50.045 --> 43:53.132
<i>Apparently,
snails thrive in cover crops,</i>

43:53.757 --> 43:56.760
<i>and they love
eating the leaves
of our citrus trees,</i>

43:57.011 --> 44:01.181
<i>which directly compromises
the trees' ability
to produce fruit.</i>

44:17.990 --> 44:19.992
<i>Alan would have known
what to do.</i>

44:24.830 --> 44:28.417
<i>But tonight
we got the call
that Alan had died.</i>

44:57.738 --> 45:00.908
<i>In one way,
I feel abandoned,</i>

45:01.158 --> 45:05.621
<i>but I really
just want to cry
because I lost my friend.</i>

45:20.344 --> 45:22.763
Hey, John,
did you see this?

45:27.476 --> 45:29.019
Man.

45:30.646 --> 45:32.231
Yeah, she's bloated.

45:39.238 --> 45:42.740
I know she's got
at least one baby somewhere,

45:42.741 --> 45:45.201
but we'll have to
figure it out
in the morning,

45:45.202 --> 45:47.246
'cause there's no way
we're gonna find it now.

45:53.961 --> 45:55.462
Ah, man.

45:56.839 --> 45:59.216
I think that's
the orphan right there.

46:02.219 --> 46:04.512
The one that lost
its mom last night.

46:04.513 --> 46:06.306
I think so.

46:07.182 --> 46:10.978
Well, we bottle-feed it
three to four times a day,

46:11.145 --> 46:14.356
or we see if he can
work it out on its own.

46:14.940 --> 46:16.358
Yeah.

46:50.350 --> 46:53.936
<i>It's a really weird feeling
to be both heartbroken</i>

46:53.937 --> 46:56.898
<i>and completely frustrated
and angry</i>

46:56.899 --> 46:58.984
<i>at the one who has died.</i>

47:02.696 --> 47:06.116
<i>Obviously, Alan
wouldn't have wanted this
to stop us,</i>

47:06.325 --> 47:11.246
<i>but it's also hard to
move forward without him.</i>

47:21.298 --> 47:23.383
John, come here.

47:26.011 --> 47:28.764
Oh, my God.
I thought that was the trunk.

47:28.972 --> 47:31.809
I mean, what do we do?
This is too many.

47:32.226 --> 47:34.561
So we can't put poison out.
Nope.

47:36.188 --> 47:38.815
So how do
they expect us to...

47:38.816 --> 47:41.401
I have no idea.

47:44.196 --> 47:46.073
This feels overwhelming.

47:48.283 --> 47:50.285
I don't even want
to think about it.

48:20.190 --> 48:21.692
Go on.

48:26.071 --> 48:27.322
Three-twenty.

48:40.168 --> 48:42.045
John,
should we take Bart?

48:45.674 --> 48:46.967
No.

49:01.773 --> 49:05.568
<i>A long dry spell across
the central and western US</i>

49:05.569 --> 49:08.029
<i>has now turned
into a full-scale drought.</i>

49:08.030 --> 49:11.073
<i>Farmers and ranchers
across 11 states
are struggling</i>

49:11.074 --> 49:13.367
<i>with a severe lack
of rain and snow.</i>

49:13.368 --> 49:15.829
<i>Among the hardest-hit
states, California.</i>

49:27.507 --> 49:30.134
<i>As the drought continues,</i>

49:30.135 --> 49:33.220
<i>there's no fresh rainwater
for the pond.</i>

49:33.221 --> 49:37.767
<i>And combined with
excess nutrients
from duck poop,</i>

49:37.768 --> 49:40.646
<i>it has caused
a toxic algae bloom.</i>

49:46.652 --> 49:48.862
<i>Another problem
created by us.</i>

49:50.697 --> 49:54.409
<i>Everything on this farm
must be contributing.</i>

49:55.494 --> 49:56.995
<i>And when it's not...</i>

50:02.167 --> 50:05.045
<i>What do we do
with a hundred ducks?</i>

50:08.465 --> 50:12.134
<i>I feel like Todd is
constantly staring deeply</i>

50:12.135 --> 50:15.806
<i>at these almost
infinitesimal details,</i>

50:19.101 --> 50:23.188
<i>like he's decoding how
the world around him works.</i>

50:38.662 --> 50:41.915
<i>So, I've started
doing the same.</i>

50:47.587 --> 50:50.047
<i>And I think
I've figured out</i>

50:50.048 --> 50:52.884
<i>what ducks love
more than ponds.</i>

51:18.660 --> 51:21.370
<i>In just a single season,</i>

51:21.371 --> 51:23.915
<i>they devoured
over 90,000 snails.</i>

51:27.252 --> 51:31.882
<i>And better yet,
they turned them
into fertilizer for the trees.</i>

51:34.342 --> 51:36.720
<i>So with every new problem
that popped up,</i>

51:37.721 --> 51:39.806
<i>I'd first take a step back</i>

51:40.891 --> 51:42.434
<i>and watch it.</i>

51:44.311 --> 51:48.773
<i>More cows and sheep,
more manure.</i>

51:58.158 --> 52:01.995
<i>To the fly,
this is the food
for their babies.</i>

52:04.372 --> 52:05.749
<i>Maggots.</i>

52:06.416 --> 52:07.834
Oh, gosh.

52:14.007 --> 52:17.511
<i>But I realized maggots
are just more food</i>

52:20.597 --> 52:21.848
<i>for chickens.</i>

52:35.153 --> 52:37.363
<i>This reduced
the fly population</i>

52:37.364 --> 52:40.575
<i>to a manageable level
of coexistence.</i>

52:42.369 --> 52:45.955
It's not like
they're just on one section.
They're kind of everywhere.

52:45.956 --> 52:48.707
<i>Weevils in the garden,
chickens.</i>

52:50.252 --> 52:53.420
<i>Observation followed
by creativity</i>

52:53.421 --> 52:56.007
<i>is becoming
our greatest ally.</i>

53:19.698 --> 53:22.284
Make sure you guys feed
that rooster in with Emma.

53:23.785 --> 53:24.870
Yeah, I got it.

53:26.246 --> 53:29.540
<i>With the piglets now
gone from Emma's woods,</i>

53:29.541 --> 53:33.252
<i>the farm's ecosystem
has responded to this void</i>

53:33.253 --> 53:34.921
<i>in a rather unexpected way.</i>

53:36.339 --> 53:38.175
<i>We call him Greasy.</i>

53:45.724 --> 53:49.936
<i>A beat-up and rejected rooster
in need of a safe home.</i>

54:28.016 --> 54:33.230
<i>Alan told me once that coexistence
with land can't be forced.</i>

54:38.318 --> 54:41.321
<i>It's more of a delicate,
patient dance...</i>

54:46.368 --> 54:48.078
<i>...with no guarantees.</i>

55:10.809 --> 55:16.105
<i>Alan claimed each year
would get easier
and more predictable.</i>

55:17.524 --> 55:19.567
<i>He called it
the rhythm of farming.</i>

55:22.654 --> 55:25.739
<i>Well, the dance
might be familiar,</i>

55:25.740 --> 55:28.868
<i>but the partners
are always changing.</i>

55:36.668 --> 55:39.754
- You've never seen it this bad before?
- Never.

55:43.049 --> 55:45.510
The gophers are
killing the trees.

55:47.095 --> 55:49.389
The gophers
loves the cover crop.

55:51.141 --> 55:53.559
We can't get rid
of the cover crop,
though, Miguel.

55:53.560 --> 55:55.436
It's the only way
we can build the soil.

55:55.437 --> 55:57.105
Oh. Uh...

56:11.453 --> 56:13.412
So owls eat gophers?

56:13.413 --> 56:15.749
Yep.
Hold the bottom.

56:18.209 --> 56:20.086
How do we know
they'll come?

56:21.171 --> 56:22.921
We don't.

56:41.107 --> 56:43.317
<i>At this point,
it feels like</i>

56:43.318 --> 56:46.529
<i>we're just growing fruit
to feed chickens.</i>

56:49.783 --> 56:52.201
<i>I think we both
had always envisioned</i>

56:52.202 --> 56:55.954
<i>that the markets
would be this place</i>

56:55.955 --> 56:58.792
<i>where we share
the bounty of our methods.</i>

57:14.391 --> 57:15.767
Oh, man.

57:17.310 --> 57:20.855
- They killed the rooster.
- Oh, man,
this guy has no head.

57:24.692 --> 57:27.611
Go on!

57:27.612 --> 57:30.531
Alex, how many birds
should have been in that coop
this morning?

57:30.532 --> 57:31.949
There should be
260-something.

57:31.950 --> 57:33.700
And how many were in there
this morning?

57:33.701 --> 57:36.370
Twenty to 30 birds I saw inside.

57:36.371 --> 57:40.582
We're missing 230 birds.
We just don't know
where they are.

57:40.583 --> 57:44.337
Our... Our fences
don't work entirely.

57:52.804 --> 57:54.763
Oh. Oh...

57:54.764 --> 57:56.808
Oh...

57:58.810 --> 58:01.728
So do you see
where they grabbed her?
Yeah.

58:01.729 --> 58:03.939
Looks like it took,
like, multiple bites.

58:03.940 --> 58:06.525
I think we have to
put her down.

58:06.526 --> 58:07.694
John!

58:11.948 --> 58:13.615
It's in
with the chickens!

58:23.084 --> 58:26.004
Where is it?
It went to the next pasture.

58:45.106 --> 58:46.649
Stay there.

59:11.257 --> 59:14.676
<i>Along with the coyote
died part of my belief</i>

59:14.677 --> 59:19.015
<i>in the power
of an uncompromising
idealism,</i>

59:21.267 --> 59:25.980
<i>the very thing
that got us to such
a beautiful place in our life.</i>

59:30.860 --> 59:34.155
<i>A place that
we cannot control.</i>

59:36.866 --> 59:39.952
<i>And just in case
we forget that,</i>

59:39.953 --> 59:42.622
<i>around here
there's a fifth season,</i>

59:44.582 --> 59:46.084
<i>the season of wind.</i>

01:00:54.819 --> 01:00:58.905
<i>This drought has become
California's driest period</i>

01:00:58.906 --> 01:01:01.409
<i>in 1,200 years.</i>

01:01:07.457 --> 01:01:11.502
<i>And as we attempt
to conserve water
on certain parts of the farm,</i>

01:01:13.212 --> 01:01:15.548
<i>it exposes a deeper truth.</i>

01:01:21.387 --> 01:01:24.348
<i>We are overly dependent
on our aquifer,</i>

01:01:24.349 --> 01:01:27.684
<i>a finite source
of groundwater
relying on rain...</i>

01:01:29.354 --> 01:01:31.230
<i>...just like us.</i>

01:02:27.745 --> 01:02:30.081
<i>Eighteen inches of rain.</i>

01:02:31.708 --> 01:02:33.584
<i>All around us,
on other farms,</i>

01:02:36.796 --> 01:02:39.757
<i>topsoil was washing
out to the sea.</i>

01:02:43.803 --> 01:02:45.138
<i>But not here.</i>

01:02:48.725 --> 01:02:52.937
<i>We were able to sequester
over a hundred million
gallons of water,</i>

01:02:55.523 --> 01:02:58.818
<i>because what our plants
and trees didn't use</i>

01:03:01.195 --> 01:03:03.531
<i>went back
into our aquifer</i>

01:03:05.408 --> 01:03:07.368
<i>beneath the ground.</i>

01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:44.071
<i>Our soil stayed.</i>

01:03:47.241 --> 01:03:48.618
<i>But why?</i>

01:03:51.287 --> 01:03:53.414
<i>It was the cover crops,</i>

01:03:54.749 --> 01:03:57.542
<i>essentially soaking in
all the rain</i>

01:03:57.543 --> 01:03:59.879
<i>like a sponge.</i>

01:04:51.973 --> 01:04:54.057
I don't understand.

01:04:54.058 --> 01:04:56.644
What's his plan?
This is ridiculous.

01:04:58.104 --> 01:05:00.356
I don't know.
You gotta ask John.

01:05:04.151 --> 01:05:09.907
<i>I've created an expectation
that to control the coyote</i>

01:05:10.783 --> 01:05:12.368
<i>means to kill him.</i>

01:05:13.703 --> 01:05:15.413
God, there's so many.

01:05:16.998 --> 01:05:19.625
Are we gonna just keep
letting this happen?

01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:32.805
All right.
Let's give this a try.

01:05:36.475 --> 01:05:39.604
Remember what we practiced.
No chasing. Okay?

01:05:42.523 --> 01:05:44.901
No.

01:05:47.194 --> 01:05:48.403
Foley!

01:05:48.404 --> 01:05:50.071
Corey!

01:05:50.072 --> 01:05:51.991
That's not gonna work.

01:05:54.410 --> 01:05:57.495
<i>I either completely
eliminate the coyote,</i>

01:05:57.496 --> 01:06:01.584
<i>or we might as well abandon
our entire egg operation.</i>

01:06:05.588 --> 01:06:08.214
Update on Emma the pig,

01:06:08.215 --> 01:06:12.052
the day before she is to
give birth yet again.

01:06:12.053 --> 01:06:13.762
And then there's the

01:06:13.763 --> 01:06:17.224
nervous boyfriend,
Mr. Greasy.

01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:21.811
A little somethin'
for them

01:06:21.812 --> 01:06:24.773
to reflect
back on the good times,

01:06:24.774 --> 01:06:26.983
when life was simple.

01:06:26.984 --> 01:06:28.944
Aw!

01:06:28.945 --> 01:06:31.447
Any guess what color
the babies are gonna be?

01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:06.768
Do these things see in the dark?

01:09:06.769 --> 01:09:09.354
Mmm-hmm.
How many are you setting up?

01:09:10.481 --> 01:09:14.609
Um, one in each orchard
and a few by the gate.

01:09:15.402 --> 01:09:17.654
Then we'll see
what's really going on
out here.

01:10:45.868 --> 01:10:49.079
<i>So why is a coyote laying
paralyzed in the garden?</i>

01:10:50.497 --> 01:10:52.165
<i>The best I can tell,</i>

01:10:52.166 --> 01:10:55.628
<i>the coyote was chasing
a gopher along the fence</i>

01:10:56.837 --> 01:11:00.089
<i>and hit an irrigation line,</i>

01:11:00.090 --> 01:11:03.636
<i>breaking both the pipe
and his neck.</i>

01:11:15.356 --> 01:11:18.150
Oh, Todd, come on.
You can't let it suffer.

01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:21.904
<i>It's a heartbreaking
realization.</i>

01:11:24.073 --> 01:11:27.159
<i>The coyote might not be
just a pest.</i>

01:11:30.412 --> 01:11:33.707
<i>He may very well be
our friend.</i>

01:11:39.546 --> 01:11:42.966
<i>Whenever I look up
at the Milky Way,</i>

01:11:42.967 --> 01:11:46.261
<i>I feel so captivated
by its complexity.</i>

01:11:46.262 --> 01:11:50.933
<i>And yet it's easy to forget
that Earth is a part of it.</i>

01:11:57.022 --> 01:11:59.817
<i>It's almost impossible
to grasp</i>

01:12:01.026 --> 01:12:03.028
<i>that I actually spin inside</i>

01:12:04.488 --> 01:12:06.615
<i>of that which I see.</i>

01:12:21.005 --> 01:12:22.673
Where's Greasy?

01:12:25.634 --> 01:12:26.969
What?

01:12:45.237 --> 01:12:47.740
I don't know if I can
forgive you for this.

01:12:48.907 --> 01:12:50.409
Look at you.

01:12:51.744 --> 01:12:54.246
I don't think you understand,
Caya, how bad this is.

01:12:56.081 --> 01:12:59.083
And look, Rosie doesn't have
anything on her.

01:12:59.084 --> 01:13:01.420
This was you.

01:13:05.716 --> 01:13:07.967
<i>Sometimes I wish
it weren't true.</i>

01:13:11.221 --> 01:13:15.100
<i>But it's those
tiny revelations
that are born from failure</i>

01:13:16.352 --> 01:13:20.146
<i>that act as a fuel
for the engine
of our ecosystem.</i>

01:13:20.147 --> 01:13:22.774
Here we are.

01:13:22.775 --> 01:13:24.442
Day two.

01:13:24.443 --> 01:13:26.320
Rosie, the chicken guardian.

01:13:26.612 --> 01:13:28.654
<i>And if I'm paying attention...</i>

01:13:28.655 --> 01:13:30.323
Good girl.

01:13:30.324 --> 01:13:31.783
<i>I get to use it.</i>

01:13:31.784 --> 01:13:34.161
Please don't eat
the chickens, Rosie.

01:13:42.252 --> 01:13:45.631
<i>With Rosie the guardian dog
protecting our chickens,</i>

01:13:47.341 --> 01:13:51.178
<i>the coyotes are now focused
on hunting gophers.</i>

01:13:52.596 --> 01:13:55.348
<i>All pests, even gophers,</i>

01:13:55.349 --> 01:13:57.393
<i>have a beneficial role.</i>

01:13:57.601 --> 01:14:01.355
<i>For one,
they aerate our soils.</i>

01:14:01.522 --> 01:14:05.525
<i>But too many gophers,
and the problems start.</i>

01:14:05.526 --> 01:14:08.112
Hey, look. See?
The gophers ate all the roots.

01:14:12.157 --> 01:14:13.282
How many?

01:14:13.283 --> 01:14:16.661
In one month,
I got 900.

01:14:16.662 --> 01:14:18.496
Nine hundred?

01:14:18.497 --> 01:14:21.374
<i>So now, the irony is,</i>

01:14:21.375 --> 01:14:25.128
<i>we actually don't have
enough coyotes</i>

01:14:25.129 --> 01:14:29.341
<i>to bring the gopher population
back into balance.</i>

01:14:33.178 --> 01:14:39.183
<i>Hopefully, there's more
to this delicate dance
of coexistence,</i>

01:14:39.184 --> 01:14:42.979
<i>because
as our farm flourishes,</i>

01:14:42.980 --> 01:14:44.731
<i>so do the pests.</i>

01:14:47.317 --> 01:14:49.319
<i>The healthier our row crops,</i>

01:14:50.529 --> 01:14:52.406
<i>the more the aphids.</i>

01:14:56.869 --> 01:14:59.328
<i>The better the fruit,</i>

01:14:59.329 --> 01:15:01.039
<i>the more the birds.</i>

01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:14.553
<i>Alan told us by
the seventh year,</i>

01:15:17.931 --> 01:15:21.143
<i>we would no longer
be alone in our farming.</i>

01:15:26.982 --> 01:15:29.526
<i>And he was right.</i>

01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:05.979
<i>You will see things that
you did not see before.</i>

01:16:07.731 --> 01:16:11.609
<i>And as I looked closer at
those aphid infestations,</i>

01:16:11.610 --> 01:16:14.112
<i>the eggs of their predator.</i>

01:16:15.822 --> 01:16:19.951
<i>You just tapped into
a power of nature</i>

01:16:19.952 --> 01:16:21.744
<i>that you can ride</i>

01:16:21.745 --> 01:16:25.707
<i>without an extraordinary
amount of effort.</i>

01:16:32.005 --> 01:16:34.049
<i>It's exactly
the same thing as surfing.</i>

01:16:38.512 --> 01:16:40.556
<i>The flywheel in motion.</i>

01:16:42.182 --> 01:16:46.936
<i>You're establishing
this equilibrium.</i>

01:16:56.488 --> 01:16:58.447
<i>Complexity,</i>

01:16:58.448 --> 01:17:00.491
<i>diversity,</i>

01:17:00.492 --> 01:17:03.870
<i>all supporting
and enhancing each other.</i>

01:17:05.497 --> 01:17:08.875
<i>You will see a web of life.</i>

01:17:12.921 --> 01:17:16.090
<i>This year we counted
87 barn owls,</i>

01:17:16.091 --> 01:17:19.720
<i>eating an estimated
15,000 gophers.</i>

01:17:21.221 --> 01:17:23.807
<i>And it didn't stop there.</i>

01:17:25.225 --> 01:17:27.727
<i>A whole host
of specialized players</i>

01:17:27.728 --> 01:17:30.063
<i>arrived to do their part.</i>

01:17:33.442 --> 01:17:36.361
<i>Hawks attacked from above.</i>

01:17:38.822 --> 01:17:41.533
<i>And from below, gopher snakes,</i>

01:17:43.368 --> 01:17:46.371
<i>weasels and badgers.</i>

01:17:52.628 --> 01:17:55.129
<i>And along with the coyotes,</i>

01:17:55.130 --> 01:17:58.216
<i>even the guardian dogs
became hunters, too.</i>

01:18:00.052 --> 01:18:02.471
Looks like Caya
got herself a new job.

01:18:03.722 --> 01:18:07.266
It hasn't even been
in that long here.

01:18:07.267 --> 01:18:08.685
That's from two inches of rain.

01:18:09.269 --> 01:18:10.561
Todd, come.

01:18:10.562 --> 01:18:12.855
<i>Of all the things
that have happened,</i>

01:18:12.856 --> 01:18:16.067
<i>the thing Alan wanted
for this farm the most,</i>

01:18:16.068 --> 01:18:18.861
<i>the most difficult thing
for us to achieve...</i>

01:18:18.862 --> 01:18:20.613
This cover crop looks great.

01:18:20.614 --> 01:18:24.659
<i>...was that which was
happening beneath our feet.</i>

01:18:24.660 --> 01:18:25.911
This is what
we're fighting.

01:18:26.828 --> 01:18:28.454
<i>It was dead.</i>

01:18:28.455 --> 01:18:29.873
<i>Compacted.</i>

01:18:30.832 --> 01:18:33.752
<i>Void of diverse life.</i>

01:18:36.129 --> 01:18:37.714
<i>But not anymore.</i>

01:18:41.176 --> 01:18:44.011
<i>Because as we added cover</i>

01:18:44.012 --> 01:18:45.722
<i>and life on top,</i>

01:18:47.808 --> 01:18:51.812
<i>a process billions
of years old awakened,</i>

01:18:59.069 --> 01:19:01.571
<i>and they returned.</i>

01:19:10.205 --> 01:19:12.998
<i>Now, on this little farm,</i>

01:19:12.999 --> 01:19:17.628
<i>there are up to
nine billion microorganisms.</i>

01:19:17.629 --> 01:19:20.214
<i>Nine billion microorganisms,</i>

01:19:20.215 --> 01:19:23.427
<i>churning away
at decaying life-forms.</i>

01:19:26.471 --> 01:19:29.307
<i>Purpose-driven organisms,</i>

01:19:33.103 --> 01:19:36.106
<i>alchemizing
death to life</i>

01:19:37.691 --> 01:19:40.736
<i>in just one clump
of healthy soil.</i>

01:19:44.406 --> 01:19:47.658
<i>Everything that dies
gets broken down</i>

01:19:47.659 --> 01:19:49.953
<i>into minerals and nutrients
to feed plants.</i>

01:19:52.497 --> 01:19:56.041
<i>Our farm is energized entirely</i>

01:19:56.042 --> 01:19:58.420
<i>by the impermanence of life.</i>

01:20:03.675 --> 01:20:05.968
You might be
an old guy now.

01:20:05.969 --> 01:20:08.847
He's having fun today.
You'll always be
our first baby.

01:20:17.314 --> 01:20:19.315
<i>We not only have the support</i>

01:20:19.316 --> 01:20:22.110
<i>of the wildlife and the soil,</i>

01:20:23.445 --> 01:20:25.863
<i>we are surrounded
by a team</i>

01:20:25.864 --> 01:20:28.241
<i>who believed
in this way enough</i>

01:20:29.284 --> 01:20:30.660
<i>to make it real.</i>

01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:38.084
Oh, boy.

01:20:41.755 --> 01:20:43.631
Come on.

01:20:48.762 --> 01:20:50.679
One more.

01:20:53.391 --> 01:20:54.517
Pull.

01:20:54.518 --> 01:20:58.145
Come on. Come on.
There you go.

01:20:58.146 --> 01:21:00.440
Girl.

01:21:04.653 --> 01:21:06.362
<i>You got a boy.</i>

01:21:06.363 --> 01:21:07.906
Oh, my gosh!

01:21:14.162 --> 01:21:15.497
He's so big.

01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:23.128
<i>It's no longer just
about proving to ourselves</i>

01:21:23.129 --> 01:21:25.215
<i>that this way of farming
can work.</i>

01:21:30.595 --> 01:21:32.597
You're on the outside now.

01:21:35.141 --> 01:21:36.726
<i>It's for him.</i>

01:22:06.256 --> 01:22:08.049
You're a good boy, Todd.

01:22:12.137 --> 01:22:13.430
Aw.

01:22:25.317 --> 01:22:27.151
His name is Todd.

01:22:27.152 --> 01:22:29.237
And he's a doggy.

01:22:36.578 --> 01:22:39.080
<i>By the time Todd died,</i>

01:22:39.915 --> 01:22:42.334
<i>the question
of who saved who</i>

01:22:43.460 --> 01:22:45.503
<i>was no longer a mystery.</i>

01:22:51.301 --> 01:22:54.637
<i>He had led us to this
interconnected beauty</i>

01:22:54.638 --> 01:22:56.222
<i>that surrounds us,</i>

01:23:01.978 --> 01:23:05.649
<i>a place that he will now
become a part of.</i>

01:23:10.654 --> 01:23:15.240
<i>It was as if he knew
his role in our lives
was now complete.</i>

01:23:15.241 --> 01:23:17.410
These are the cherry trees,

01:23:17.744 --> 01:23:20.038
and there are apple trees.

01:23:21.122 --> 01:23:24.960
<i>We now had someone else
to be brave for.</i>

01:23:49.192 --> 01:23:51.068
Wow.
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

01:23:51.069 --> 01:23:54.530
Who's that?
A ladybug!

01:23:54.531 --> 01:23:56.741
You think so?
Yes!

01:24:04.874 --> 01:24:08.920
Tropic snow peaches,
those are going to
Erewhon LA.

01:24:09.963 --> 01:24:13.966
<i>We sold over 500,000 pounds
of food that year.</i>

01:24:13.967 --> 01:24:15.260
These look great this year.
Yeah.

01:24:17.178 --> 01:24:20.557
$3.25.
<i>And that's when it happened.</i>

01:24:22.225 --> 01:24:25.686
<i>It is now the largest wildfire
on record in California.</i>

01:24:25.687 --> 01:24:27.438
Mommy, we gotta go!

01:24:27.439 --> 01:24:29.314
Yeah, let's go.

01:24:29.315 --> 01:24:31.650
I think we're surrounded
by, like, three fires.

01:24:31.651 --> 01:24:33.610
Well, these winds
definitely aren't helping.

01:24:33.611 --> 01:24:36.071
If something happens
on these hills
over here, then...

01:24:36.072 --> 01:24:38.365
Well, then we'd be toast.

01:24:38.366 --> 01:24:40.325
John, I can see it
out the window.

01:24:40.326 --> 01:24:42.911
<i>Molly, it's still
really far away.</i>

01:24:42.912 --> 01:24:44.914
<i>We're just getting prepared
in case, okay?</i>

01:24:45.874 --> 01:24:48.460
No, no, no. Oh, man.

01:24:49.544 --> 01:24:51.295
This is how they start.

01:24:51.296 --> 01:24:54.506
<i>Okay, guys, another
small fire has started.</i>

01:24:54.507 --> 01:24:58.469
<i>It's on the neighbor's
property, but if itj umps
into those fields,</i>

01:24:58.470 --> 01:24:59.928
we're in trouble.

01:24:59.929 --> 01:25:02.139
<i>John, I just heard that.
We're gonna go.</i>

01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:04.850
<i>A massive wildfire raging
in Southern California...</i>

01:25:04.851 --> 01:25:07.269
<i>Our good intent towards nature...</i>
Let's go, go, go.

01:25:07.270 --> 01:25:10.105
<i>...won't shield us from facing
her impermanence.</i>

01:25:12.442 --> 01:25:14.359
John, there's an electric wire.
Careful.

01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:15.986
<i>As it consumes just about
everything in its path...</i>

01:25:15.987 --> 01:25:17.071
I want my toys!

01:25:17.072 --> 01:25:21.325
<i>If we've learned anything,
forward momentum and hope...</i>

01:25:21.326 --> 01:25:24.954
<i>...that's what nurtures luck.</i>

01:25:27.707 --> 01:25:33.378
<i>Which can look
as simple as the winds
changing direction.</i>

01:25:33.379 --> 01:25:35.589
Welcome home, guys.

01:25:35.590 --> 01:25:37.591
This is all the stuff
that she packed

01:25:37.592 --> 01:25:39.551
when she decided
she was gonna evacuate.

01:25:39.552 --> 01:25:42.137
We have a back roller.

01:25:42.138 --> 01:25:44.348
I thought we'd be stressed out.
Yeah.

01:25:44.349 --> 01:25:46.100
Here's one I like right here.

01:25:46.101 --> 01:25:49.228
<i>The Power of Myth,</i>
which I read about 20 years ago.

01:25:51.106 --> 01:25:52.815
A gym bag.
That's a...

01:25:52.816 --> 01:25:56.235
I know. That's, like,
how Mommy packed.

01:25:56.236 --> 01:25:59.071
Here we go, guys.
That looks so good.

01:25:59.072 --> 01:26:03.283
<i>I didn't expect that the
hardships that we would face</i>

01:26:03.284 --> 01:26:07.705
<i>make the actual dream itself
feel so much more alive.</i>

01:26:14.003 --> 01:26:17.297
Hey, everybody,
welcome to Apricot Lane Farms.

01:26:17.298 --> 01:26:19.550
- Who came from the furthest?
- Hong Kong.

01:26:19.551 --> 01:26:20.634
Hong Kong?

01:26:20.635 --> 01:26:22.010
India.
India?

01:26:22.011 --> 01:26:23.303
- China.
- Texas.

01:26:23.304 --> 01:26:24.471
Texas.

01:26:24.472 --> 01:26:27.558
That is almost
another country.
Yes, it is.

01:26:27.559 --> 01:26:29.810
- This is Emma.
- Hi, Emma.

01:26:33.439 --> 01:26:36.275
Her days of breeding
have really come to an end.

01:26:36.276 --> 01:26:40.071
Now her purpose is
entertaining you all.

01:26:42.115 --> 01:26:43.533
You're a good girl.

01:26:44.993 --> 01:26:47.620
And this is Alan York Lookout.

01:26:50.456 --> 01:26:52.541
It's named after our mentor.

01:26:52.542 --> 01:26:55.627
- Amazing!
- That is so beautiful.

01:26:55.628 --> 01:26:58.214
Unfortunately,
he passed away, uh,

01:26:59.924 --> 01:27:01.551
at the wrong time.

01:27:02.510 --> 01:27:03.636
Um...

01:27:08.099 --> 01:27:12.686
I remember I asked Alan
if he designed
the contours of this block

01:27:12.687 --> 01:27:15.064
to prevent water
from running off.

01:27:15.273 --> 01:27:19.360
And he would say,
"Yeah. And...

01:27:19.611 --> 01:27:22.405
""Cause it's beautiful."

01:27:25.950 --> 01:27:28.536
<i>The beautiful complexity
of our land</i>

01:27:29.579 --> 01:27:32.540
<i>is alive
with infinite possibility.</i>

01:28:18.211 --> 01:28:19.587
<i>We were never alone.</i>

01:28:21.130 --> 01:28:22.674
<i>Not for a second.</i>

01:28:25.134 --> 01:28:27.052
Mornin', Bodie!

01:28:27.053 --> 01:28:31.640
<i>And if the whole thing
from the beginning was to live
in harmony with nature...</i>

01:28:31.641 --> 01:28:33.058
Morning, Mama.

01:28:33.059 --> 01:28:35.686
<i>...well, we made it this far</i>

01:28:35.687 --> 01:28:38.563
<i>with a comfortable level
of disharmony.</i>

01:28:43.611 --> 01:28:46.072
<i>The ecosystem
of our entire planet</i>

01:28:47.699 --> 01:28:49.741
<i>works the same way.</i>

01:28:49.742 --> 01:28:51.286
You're a good girl, Caya.

01:28:58.459 --> 01:29:00.211
<i>And when I look at it
like that...</i>

01:29:05.341 --> 01:29:07.509
<i>...it's perfect.</i>

01:29:13.433 --> 01:29:15.225
So, what do you want to pick?

01:29:15.226 --> 01:29:17.227
I want to pick some nectarines.

01:29:17.228 --> 01:29:19.271
Okay.
We'll pick some nectarines.

01:29:19.272 --> 01:29:22.774
You made me happy.

01:29:22.775 --> 01:29:25.278
We should have
brought a paper bag.

01:29:25.611 --> 01:29:28.906
Look how many there are.
Oh, that one's gonna be so good.

01:29:31.701 --> 01:29:34.911
<i>What we are a part of</i>

01:29:34.912 --> 01:29:37.664
<i>Is bigger than we know</i>

01:29:37.665 --> 01:29:41.126
<i>And the height of our ability</i>

01:29:41.127 --> 01:29:44.046
<i>Is further than we go</i>

01:29:44.047 --> 01:29:48.008
<i>And fear is just
another problem</i>

01:29:48.009 --> 01:29:50.469
<i>We will figure out</i>

01:29:50.470 --> 01:29:52.262
Whoa. Hello.

01:29:52.263 --> 01:29:54.890
<i>And we will grow our garden</i>

01:29:54.891 --> 01:29:58.019
<i>Come sun, flood or drought</i>

01:29:59.312 --> 01:30:01.147
Morning, girls.

01:30:03.483 --> 01:30:06.318
<i>How far into a dream</i>

01:30:06.319 --> 01:30:08.070
<i>Would you follow me?</i>

01:30:08.071 --> 01:30:09.696
Come on, Emma!

01:30:09.697 --> 01:30:12.449
<i>And how sure of a thing</i>

01:30:12.450 --> 01:30:14.452
<i>Does it gotta be?</i>

01:30:15.953 --> 01:30:20.958
<i>In the most uncertain times
of certainty</i>

01:30:22.293 --> 01:30:26.798
<i>All that I am counting on
is you and me</i>

01:30:28.341 --> 01:30:30.967
<i>And what we are a part of...</i>

01:30:30.968 --> 01:30:34.305
I'm gonna pick five.
You want to pick
five blueberries?

01:30:35.264 --> 01:30:37.141
Okay, just five, okay?

01:30:37.308 --> 01:30:39.810
One, two...

01:30:39.811 --> 01:30:41.978
You can count 'em
when you start pickin' 'em.

01:30:41.979 --> 01:30:44.022
One...

01:30:44.023 --> 01:30:46.900
One...

01:30:46.901 --> 01:30:49.152
And here's one.

01:30:49.153 --> 01:30:52.823
Hey, buddy,
how many have you picked so far?

01:30:52.824 --> 01:30:54.117
I have...

01:30:55.159 --> 01:30:56.451
One.

01:30:56.452 --> 01:30:59.746
<i>And what we are a part of</i>

01:30:59.747 --> 01:31:02.791
<i>Is bigger than we know</i>

01:31:02.792 --> 01:31:06.044
<i>And the height of our ability</i>

01:31:06.045 --> 01:31:09.172
<i>Is further than we go</i>

01:31:09.173 --> 01:31:13.135
<i>And fear is just
another problem</i>

01:31:13.136 --> 01:31:15.430
<i>We will figure out</i>

01:31:17.432 --> 01:31:20.642
<i>And we will grow our garden</i>

01:31:23.479 --> 01:31:26.858
<i>Yeah, we will grow our garden</i>

01:31:29.777 --> 01:31:32.988
<i>We will grow our garden</i>

01:31:32.989 --> 01:31:35.700
<i>Come sun</i>

01:31:36.367 --> 01:31:39.996
<i>Flood or drought</i>
