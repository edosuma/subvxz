WEBVTT

00:01.280 --> 00:03.709
- You can't put the needs
of our child

00:04.014 --> 00:05.066
above your own.

00:05.067 --> 00:06.244
- I'm not saying that.
- Then what are you saying?

00:06.268 --> 00:08.802
Because I may not be
a mother yet,

00:08.837 --> 00:10.404
but I know that's what
parenthood means.

00:10.439 --> 00:11.716
- You wanna take me on,
you go for it.

00:11.740 --> 00:12.851
'Cause I didn't get where I am

00:12.875 --> 00:14.641
by letting people like you
push me around.

00:14.677 --> 00:16.109
- David Fox wants a fight,

00:16.145 --> 00:17.244
and I'm gonna give him one.

00:17.279 --> 00:18.245
- Are you threatening my job?

00:18.280 --> 00:20.147
- I like you, always have.

00:20.182 --> 00:22.716
But if you don't get yourself
on the right of this thing

00:22.751 --> 00:24.496
you're never gonna go further
than you are right now.

00:24.520 --> 00:27.387
- I care about the kids this
charity is supposed to serve.

00:27.423 --> 00:29.790
But you wouldn't know that
because I just don't...

00:29.825 --> 00:30.791
trust...
- People.

00:30.826 --> 00:32.392
- Are you saying
you took another job?

00:32.427 --> 00:34.928
- No, I'm saying I got someone
else to take another job.

00:34.963 --> 00:36.007
- You still didn't do
what I asked.

00:36.031 --> 00:37.208
- I signed a client
that's gonna be worth

00:37.232 --> 00:38.999
a huge amount
to this firm.

00:39.034 --> 00:41.068
I'm a hell of a goddamn lawyer.

00:41.103 --> 00:43.181
- You start paying those people
what they're worth...

00:43.205 --> 00:44.404
- And?

00:44.440 --> 00:46.351
- You get free legal services
from Harvey Specter himself

00:46.375 --> 00:47.674
for the next year.

00:47.710 --> 00:48.853
You didn't notice that one
of your star attorneys

00:48.877 --> 00:50.077
was thinking about leaving.

00:50.112 --> 00:51.344
And now, thanks to me,

00:51.380 --> 00:52.579
he's gonna stay.

00:52.614 --> 00:55.048
- You're talking about Alex.
- Sometimes, you need

00:55.084 --> 00:58.685
to let us do what we do
the way we do it.

01:02.357 --> 01:04.590
- Hello, stranger...
seems the only thing

01:04.626 --> 01:05.692
I see of you lately

01:05.728 --> 01:07.260
is your name on the wall.

01:07.296 --> 01:08.840
- That's because I've been
out of town a few days,

01:08.864 --> 01:09.763
and I need your help.

01:09.798 --> 01:10.831
- Give it to me.

01:10.866 --> 01:12.610
- I've got a legal situation,
and it's personal.

01:12.634 --> 01:13.467
- Which means you need me

01:13.502 --> 01:15.736
to send one of ours your way.

01:15.771 --> 01:17.437
- I was thinking Alex Williams.

01:17.473 --> 01:18.905
<i>- Would you mind if I ask</i>

01:18.941 --> 01:19.951
why you didn't
just call him yourself?

01:19.975 --> 01:21.808
<i>- I was thinking about</i>

01:21.844 --> 01:23.188
a conversation we had
a few weeks ago.

01:23.212 --> 01:26.646
You helped me see some things
about fostering firm harmony.

01:26.682 --> 01:27.759
- And if you called him
directly,

01:27.783 --> 01:29.561
you wouldn't have had a chance
to tell me that.

01:29.585 --> 01:30.617
- Right again, Red.

01:30.652 --> 01:32.352
- I'm guessing
firm harmony is also why

01:32.387 --> 01:33.854
you want Alex and not Samantha.

01:33.889 --> 01:35.021
<i>- A little bit of that,</i>

01:35.057 --> 01:36.201
and a little
of the nature of the case.

01:36.225 --> 01:39.760
<i>- Then why don't you tell me</i>
<i>where you are,</i>

01:39.795 --> 01:42.162
what Alex needs to bring,
and I will make sure

01:42.197 --> 01:44.131
<i>that he is on his way.</i>

01:48.637 --> 01:50.003
- Harvey Specter.

01:51.173 --> 01:52.739
- David Fox.

01:52.775 --> 01:54.374
To what do I owe the--

01:54.409 --> 01:56.042
what's the opposite
of pleasure?

01:56.078 --> 01:58.044
- I'm here 'cause of this.
It's a deal.

01:58.080 --> 01:59.012
It just needs
a little taking care of.

01:59.047 --> 02:00.714
- Well, in that case,

02:00.749 --> 02:02.160
just go ahead
and throw it in the trash,

02:02.184 --> 02:04.718
'cause I don't work for you
and I'm never going to.

02:05.721 --> 02:06.686
- Uh, I'm not asking.
I'm assigning.

02:06.722 --> 02:07.821
This is part of our deal.

02:07.856 --> 02:10.757
- I don't have any deal
with you.

02:10.793 --> 02:12.492
- She didn't tell you, did she?

02:15.130 --> 02:16.496
- Who didn't tell me what?

02:16.532 --> 02:17.597
- Donna.

02:17.633 --> 02:20.233
We made a deal
where you're my lawyer.

02:20.269 --> 02:21.401
I'm holding you both to it.

02:21.436 --> 02:24.104
And if you got a problem
with that...

02:25.374 --> 02:26.873
Take it up with her.

02:33.682 --> 02:34.726
- Donna.
What can I do for you?

02:34.750 --> 02:35.860
- You can get your ass
into the limo

02:35.884 --> 02:37.951
that's waiting for you
downstairs.

02:37.986 --> 02:40.854
- I didn't call a limo.
- I know you didn't.

02:40.889 --> 02:41.755
Robert Zane did.

02:41.790 --> 02:43.456
- And where exactly
is Robert sending me?

02:43.492 --> 02:44.791
- Upstate New York.

02:44.827 --> 02:45.870
He has some business
he needs help with.

02:45.894 --> 02:48.995
So whatever needs fixing,
fix it fast.

02:49.483 --> 02:50.693
- Did you go through
my underwear drawer?

02:50.717 --> 02:52.550
- As fun as that would have
made my morning,

02:52.586 --> 02:54.216
no, Alex, I didn't.

02:54.217 --> 02:56.078
I bought a bag
with exactly everything

02:56.079 --> 02:57.323
you'll need
for as long as you're gone.

02:57.347 --> 02:58.212
- And how could you
possibly know

02:58.248 --> 02:59.572
that's everything I'll need?

02:59.573 --> 03:01.321
- Because Robert needed me to.

03:02.295 --> 03:04.896
And because I'm Donna.

03:04.931 --> 03:06.798
Limo's not gonna wait
all day, Alex.

03:09.836 --> 03:12.421
Morning, Harvey.
What can I do for you?

03:12.422 --> 03:14.620
- You can tell me
David Fox isn't my client.

03:14.621 --> 03:17.622
- I'm sorry, I can't do that,
because he is.

03:17.657 --> 03:19.524
For a year.
Free of charge.

03:19.559 --> 03:20.559
- How is that possible?

03:20.593 --> 03:22.260
- It's possible
because you empowered me

03:22.295 --> 03:23.328
to negotiate with him,

03:23.363 --> 03:24.573
and that's what it took
to get it done.

03:24.597 --> 03:26.564
- And when were you
gonna tell me

03:26.599 --> 03:28.066
about this brilliant idea
of yours?

03:28.101 --> 03:29.300
- I already did tell you

03:29.336 --> 03:30.579
when I added him
to your updated client roster.

03:30.603 --> 03:31.714
- You know damn well
I don't read

03:31.738 --> 03:34.539
my updated client roster.

03:34.574 --> 03:35.640
- Okay.
You got me.

03:35.675 --> 03:36.886
I just wanted to see
the look on your face

03:36.910 --> 03:39.210
when he came to you
and you realized

03:39.245 --> 03:40.178
you didn't have a choice.

03:40.213 --> 03:42.046
And there it is.

03:42.082 --> 03:44.215
- You think this is funny?
- No, Harvey.

03:44.250 --> 03:45.316
I don't.

03:45.352 --> 03:46.495
And the real reason
I didn't tell you

03:46.519 --> 03:48.199
is because I knew
you'd react like a child.

03:48.524 --> 03:50.110
But I made a deal
that you gave me

03:50.111 --> 03:51.582
the authority to make
because you knew

03:51.583 --> 03:53.019
you couldn't come to one
yourself,

03:53.020 --> 03:54.362
so whatever it is
you're feeling,

03:54.363 --> 03:56.694
suck it up,
take one for the team,

03:56.695 --> 03:58.762
and get this thing done.

- Sheila, I know
we're trying to conceive,

04:39.703 --> 04:41.503
but I can't have sex with you
right now.

04:41.539 --> 04:43.205
I just ate an onion bagel.

04:43.240 --> 04:44.606
- I'm not calling for that,
Louis.

04:44.642 --> 04:45.819
- Well, then, why'd you call
on the sex phone?

04:45.843 --> 04:47.187
- Because I knew you'd answer,
and...

04:47.211 --> 04:50.412
<i>I just couldn't wait</i>
<i>to tell u.</i>

04:50.448 --> 04:51.480
Louis...

04:53.083 --> 04:54.550
We hit the jackpot.

04:54.585 --> 04:55.451
<i>- What jackpot?</i>

04:55.486 --> 04:57.119
- <i> The </i> jackpot.

04:57.154 --> 04:58.465
- Publisher's Clearing House?
<i>- No.</i>

04:58.489 --> 05:01.323
I mean we don't need
the sexphone anymore

05:01.358 --> 05:06.728
because... well, Louis...
you hit the bull's-eye.

05:06.764 --> 05:09.298
- Oh, my God!
My boys can swim?

05:09.333 --> 05:10.632
<i>- Yes, my king.</i>

05:10.668 --> 05:12.234
Yes, they can.

05:12.269 --> 05:14.436
- Sheila, this is amazing!
We need to tell my--

05:14.472 --> 05:17.973
- Louis... I know you're gonna
want to tell everyone,

05:18.008 --> 05:20.609
but, before you do,
I want you to promise

05:20.644 --> 05:22.789
that we'll keep this between
the two of us for a while.

05:22.813 --> 05:24.313
- Wait, so you mean
not tell anyone?

05:24.348 --> 05:25.747
<i>- Yeah, just for a while.</i>

05:25.783 --> 05:27.027
- Okay, Sheila,
can you hold on a sec?

05:27.051 --> 05:29.017
I think I'm getting a call.

05:33.724 --> 05:34.523
Oh. Okay.

05:34.558 --> 05:36.091
It was just a billing question.

05:36.126 --> 05:36.892
All taken care of.

05:36.927 --> 05:38.727
<i>- You just jumped up and down</i>

05:38.762 --> 05:40.796
in your entirely glass office,
didn't you?

05:40.831 --> 05:42.397
- Yes, but I stopped now.

05:43.734 --> 05:45.000
- Then I'll see you tonight.

05:45.035 --> 05:47.102
And we can celebrate properly.

05:52.042 --> 05:54.243
- Ah, Gretchen.
Good, you're here.

05:54.278 --> 05:55.355
Listen, I need you to file--

05:55.379 --> 05:56.812
- Sheila's pregnant, isn't she?

05:56.847 --> 05:57.958
- Oh, shit,
how could you know that?

05:57.982 --> 05:59.982
- Two minutes ago,
you were on your sex phone.

06:00.017 --> 06:02.684
Then you started dancing
up and down like "Footloose,"

06:02.720 --> 06:04.219
pointing
to your nether regions.

06:04.255 --> 06:05.187
What else could it be?

06:05.222 --> 06:06.588
- Nothing else.

06:07.291 --> 06:08.590
Gretchen.

06:10.561 --> 06:11.527
I'm gonna have a baby.

06:11.562 --> 06:14.763
- I can't believe
I'm saying this, Louis.

06:14.798 --> 06:16.298
You're gonna be
a world-class father.

06:16.333 --> 06:17.733
- That I am.

06:17.768 --> 06:18.979
And I intend to be a part
of every moment,

06:19.003 --> 06:20.580
which is why I need you
to look into what it takes

06:20.604 --> 06:21.648
to get certified as a midwife.

06:21.672 --> 06:23.872
- If you think I'm gonna
be midwife to your baby,

06:23.908 --> 06:25.374
you got a whole
nother thing coming.

06:25.409 --> 06:26.542
- No, not for you, for me.

06:26.577 --> 06:27.577
- And I'm out.
- What?

06:27.611 --> 06:28.844
You think I couldn't do it?

06:28.879 --> 06:31.713
- I know you couldn't.
- Well, damn it, Gretchen.

06:31.749 --> 06:33.382
- Do you want to be
a wet nurse too?

06:33.417 --> 06:34.628
- You know what?
I would if I could.

06:34.652 --> 06:36.563
And you just said
that I would be a great father.

06:36.587 --> 06:37.764
So are you gonna help me
with this or not?

06:37.788 --> 06:39.655
- All right, Louis.
I'll look into it.

06:39.690 --> 06:41.857
But it's like I said before.

06:41.892 --> 06:44.860
You're gonna be a great father.

06:47.565 --> 06:48.565
- Okay, David.

06:48.599 --> 06:50.666
What exactly is it
that you want?

06:50.701 --> 06:52.646
Because you certainly don't
need me to hold your hand

06:52.670 --> 06:53.769
while you buy a building.

06:53.804 --> 06:55.971
- I do if that building's owner
is my biggest rival.

06:56.006 --> 06:58.440
- And because that owner knows
what an asshole you are,

06:58.475 --> 06:59.819
you need to make sure
he doesn't know

06:59.843 --> 07:01.343
you're the one
doing the buying.

07:01.378 --> 07:03.645
- See, this is why
I'm paying you the big bucks.

07:03.681 --> 07:05.447
Oh, wait,
I'm not paying you anything.

07:05.482 --> 07:07.583
- Just so we're clear,
you get one of those.

07:07.618 --> 07:09.785
Because I may
have to represent you,

07:09.820 --> 07:12.621
but I don't have to tolerate
your mouth.

07:12.656 --> 07:14.423
- And just so we're clear,

07:14.458 --> 07:16.525
this guy's a douche,
not an idiot.

07:16.560 --> 07:17.637
He's gonna be looking
for me to try to buy

07:17.661 --> 07:19.695
that building,
so I need you to be smart.

07:19.730 --> 07:21.608
- And that's the second time
you've brought this up.

07:21.632 --> 07:23.365
Which makes me wonder
if there's something

07:23.400 --> 07:25.962
going on here,
because hiding a buyer

07:25.963 --> 07:27.839
isn't illegal,
but it sure as hell can be.

07:27.840 --> 07:30.707
- The only thing going on here
is that John Billows has

07:30.743 --> 07:35.145
a piece of candy
and I want to take it from him.

07:35.180 --> 07:37.214
One other thing.

07:37.249 --> 07:39.616
This is my business.

07:39.651 --> 07:41.651
So you take this on,
you get it done,

07:41.687 --> 07:43.787
or you don't take it on at all.

07:55.434 --> 07:56.566
- Robert.
Good to see you.

07:56.602 --> 07:59.603
- Thanks for coming, Alex.
How was the drive?

07:59.638 --> 08:03.406
- Scenic. Let me guess.
The owner's our client.

08:03.442 --> 08:05.675
- The owner's me.

08:05.711 --> 08:07.811
- I gotta tell you, Robert,
making wine's

08:07.846 --> 08:09.513
not exactly the hobby
I pictured for you.

08:09.548 --> 08:11.515
- It's not a hobby,
it's an investment.

08:11.550 --> 08:14.317
And right now,
it's netting less than zero.

08:14.353 --> 08:16.019
- What can I do to help?

08:16.054 --> 08:17.832
- Why don't we first start
with a little tour?

08:22.661 --> 08:24.305
- Samantha, can I talk to you
for a second?

08:24.329 --> 08:26.096
- Sure, what's on your mind?

08:26.131 --> 08:29.466
- You and Alex
and Robert and Harvey...

08:29.501 --> 08:31.468
Harvey's got a case
that he doesn't want,

08:31.503 --> 08:32.813
but there's nothing that says
that he can't

08:32.837 --> 08:34.437
get a little outside help
on it.

08:34.472 --> 08:35.438
- Don't tell me you're trying
to give me a leg up

08:35.474 --> 08:37.407
with Harvey,
because you wouldn't do that

08:37.442 --> 08:38.642
and I don't need it.

08:38.677 --> 08:40.076
- You're right.
I wouldn't.

08:40.111 --> 08:41.477
But sooner or later,
it's gonna be

08:41.513 --> 08:43.413
either you or Alex
who go up on that wall next,

08:43.448 --> 08:44.626
and no matter who
goes up there first,

08:44.650 --> 08:46.483
the other team isn't gonna
be happy about it.

08:46.518 --> 08:48.118
But the more we're bonded
as a family

08:48.153 --> 08:49.264
before that happens,
the more likely

08:49.288 --> 08:52.956
we'll stay a family
after it does.

08:52.991 --> 08:54.035
- Then I just have
one question.

08:54.059 --> 08:54.958
When you said
Harvey doesn't want

08:54.993 --> 08:56.827
to take the case
but he has to...

08:56.862 --> 08:58.028
- I did.
- Why?

08:58.063 --> 08:59.407
- Because I struck a deal
with David Fox,

08:59.431 --> 09:01.164
and Harvey can't stand him.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.500
- Can you?
- Not particularly.

09:03.535 --> 09:04.679
- Then why don't you
get me up to speed

09:04.703 --> 09:08.071
before I go pay a visit
to this David Fox.

09:17.916 --> 09:19.282
- Well?

09:19.318 --> 09:20.895
- I'm more of a craft brew--
- Oh, save the bullshit.

09:20.919 --> 09:24.921
I know. It tastes like ass.
That's my problem.

09:24.957 --> 09:26.134
- So you want me
to fire your winemaker?

09:26.158 --> 09:27.435
- No, I want you
to go after the son of a bitch

09:27.459 --> 09:29.003
who didn't deliver the barrels
that I paid for.

09:29.027 --> 09:33.230
Because I had to let my wine
stay in these vats,

09:33.265 --> 09:35.899
and it turned into that vinegar
you're now holding.

09:35.934 --> 09:37.245
- And no one's interested
in buying vinegar.

09:37.269 --> 09:39.769
- I lost my entire harvest!

09:39.805 --> 09:41.338
- Shit.

09:41.373 --> 09:42.239
What did the guy say

09:42.274 --> 09:44.407
when you called
about the barrels?

09:44.443 --> 09:46.109
- That they'd be here tomorrow.

09:46.144 --> 09:47.477
And tomorrow. And tomorrow.

09:47.512 --> 09:50.547
And meanwhile, all my neighbors
got their barrels just fine.

09:50.582 --> 09:53.383
Which makes me think
there's more going on here

09:53.418 --> 09:54.651
than it looks like.

09:55.196 --> 09:56.273
- You think this is about race?

09:56.297 --> 09:58.866
- I think, between the looks
I got at the bank

09:58.867 --> 10:00.404
and the cold shoulder
I got at the market

10:00.405 --> 10:01.069
and now this...

10:01.069 --> 10:01.834
- You've seen this movie
before.

10:01.870 --> 10:03.036
- Different cast,

10:03.071 --> 10:03.970
different location,

10:04.005 --> 10:05.471
but the same damn script.

10:05.761 --> 10:07.138
- Robert,
if that's what's going on here,

10:07.162 --> 10:09.298
I'm not sure a lawsuit is gonna
get these guys to back off.

10:09.299 --> 10:11.700
- Look, I'm not saying
they're wearing white robes.

10:11.701 --> 10:12.744
I'm saying
they're trying to keep me

10:12.768 --> 10:14.935
out of the country club.

10:13.506 --> 10:14.572
- What do you want to do?

10:14.608 --> 10:16.574
- I want to send a message

10:16.610 --> 10:17.787
that if they try this shit
again,

10:17.811 --> 10:19.577
there's not gonna be
a country club.

10:24.951 --> 10:27.885
- The great Harvey Specter
walking through my door.

10:27.921 --> 10:28.961
Now I know I'm a big deal.

10:28.989 --> 10:29.954
- Not as big as the deal

10:29.990 --> 10:32.423
I'm about to offer you,
Mr. Billows.

10:32.459 --> 10:34.225
- Oh, I like you already.

10:34.261 --> 10:35.738
- Then you're really gonna love
my client.

10:35.762 --> 10:36.728
Santana Developers.

10:36.763 --> 10:37.940
They're an up-and-coming
real estate firm

10:37.964 --> 10:39.442
from the southwest,
and, fortunately for you,

10:39.466 --> 10:43.067
they've taken an interest
in your redevelopment project

10:43.103 --> 10:43.868
on Liberty Avenue.

10:43.903 --> 10:45.470
- Have they, now?

10:45.505 --> 10:47.183
Well, that's a shame,
'cause it's not for sale.

10:47.207 --> 10:50.341
And there's no southwest firm
that I've never heard of.

10:50.377 --> 10:52.644
- All right. You got me.

10:52.679 --> 10:56.147
My client's associated closely
with the government of Dubai.

10:56.182 --> 10:58.316
A fact
they'd rather not announce,

10:58.351 --> 11:02.620
and, in exchange
for that secrecy,

11:02.656 --> 11:04.989
they're willing
to offer you this.

11:09.262 --> 11:10.302
- Thank you for your time.

11:10.330 --> 11:13.598
- John, that's 25%
over market value.

11:13.633 --> 11:14.633
All cash.

11:14.668 --> 11:17.068
- And I told you,
I'm not selling.

11:17.103 --> 11:20.071
Least of all to David Fox.

11:20.106 --> 11:21.806
All right, John, look--

11:21.841 --> 11:22.918
All right, look,
I'll give you credit.

11:22.942 --> 11:24.876
I mean, you do live up
to your reputation.

11:25.013 --> 11:25.945
'Cause a fallback straw man

11:25.981 --> 11:27.519
is something
even I never thought of.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.798
- And if you really knew
my reputation,

11:28.822 --> 11:32.590
you'd know a straw man
is just my first move.

11:32.626 --> 11:33.736
You don't want to see
what I'm gonna

11:33.760 --> 11:35.126
come at you with next.

11:35.161 --> 11:36.060
- Well, I believe you'll try

11:36.096 --> 11:38.363
to cut off my financing.

11:38.398 --> 11:40.965
But my partners are in China.

11:41.001 --> 11:44.102
And I've been in bed with them
for ten years.

11:44.137 --> 11:48.072
They trust me implicitly.

11:48.108 --> 11:49.674
Good day, Mr. Specter.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.277
My regards to David Fox.

12:00.702 --> 12:02.451
Louis, I can't believe

12:02.452 --> 12:04.428
you got us a reservation here
so quickly.

12:04.429 --> 12:07.664
- Sheila, you're gonna be
the mother of my son.

12:07.699 --> 12:09.432
I'm getting you in
wherever you want to go.

12:09.468 --> 12:12.002
- Son?
- Or daughter.

12:12.037 --> 12:13.247
- Well, here's to watching
either one of them

12:13.271 --> 12:18.141
take ballet lessons and tap
and learn to twirl the baton.

12:18.176 --> 12:19.320
- Oh, my God,
I get to teach him the baton.

12:19.344 --> 12:21.778
I can't wait.
It's why I want to have a boy.

12:21.813 --> 12:24.147
- And I can't wait because
we're gonna be a family.

12:24.182 --> 12:25.982
And we're gonna
do everything together.

12:26.018 --> 12:28.084
We're gonna get ready
in the morning together.

12:28.120 --> 12:29.397
We're gonna go
on vacations together.

12:29.421 --> 12:30.665
- We're gonna get to visit him
at Camp Brucha

12:30.689 --> 12:31.799
and see him come running out
in his little--

12:31.823 --> 12:35.592
- Wait a second.
Camp Brucha?

12:35.627 --> 12:37.694
- No, Sheila, I know I told you
that the kids there

12:37.729 --> 12:38.661
burned all my underwear,

12:38.697 --> 12:39.774
but I'm telling you,
it made me stronger.

12:39.798 --> 12:41.409
- Louis, your underwear
isn't what I'm talking about.

12:41.433 --> 12:45.568
I meant
Brucha is a Jewish camp.

12:45.604 --> 12:46.981
- Yeah, so what?
- So it never occurred to me

12:47.005 --> 12:49.172
that you'd want
to raise our child Jewish.

12:49.207 --> 12:50.540
- Of course I do.

12:50.575 --> 12:52.042
I thought
it went without saying.

12:52.077 --> 12:53.488
- Just like I thought
it went without saying

12:53.512 --> 12:54.622
that we wouldn't
raise them anything.

12:54.646 --> 12:58.348
- Why would you think that?
- Okay, Louis.

12:58.383 --> 12:59.794
How would your parents feel
if we said

12:59.818 --> 13:03.153
we were gonna raise
our child Catholic?

13:03.188 --> 13:03.887
Exactly.

13:03.922 --> 13:05.099
That's how my parents
would feel

13:05.123 --> 13:07.524
if we raised our child Jewish.

13:07.559 --> 13:09.726
- Yeah, but it's different.
- Not to me, it isn't.

13:09.761 --> 13:11.761
- Sheila--
- Louis, please.

13:11.797 --> 13:13.897
This is supposed to be
a celebration.

13:13.932 --> 13:16.566
Can't you just let it go?

13:16.601 --> 13:18.034
- Of course, Sheila.

13:18.070 --> 13:20.637
Consider it gone.

13:21.673 --> 13:23.106
- Miles Newton.

13:25.377 --> 13:26.509
- Yes?

13:26.545 --> 13:27.444
- My name is Alex Williams.

13:27.479 --> 13:30.080
I represent Robert Zane.

13:30.115 --> 13:32.048
- Represent?
- That's right.

13:32.084 --> 13:34.384
He's suing you
for breach of contract.

13:34.419 --> 13:35.285
- This is ridiculous.

13:35.320 --> 13:36.597
I told him
it was a clerical error.

13:36.621 --> 13:37.832
- And that error cost him
his yield for the season.

13:37.856 --> 13:39.100
- Look, I also told him
that I'll comp him

13:39.124 --> 13:42.959
all the barrels that he needs
next year to make up for it.

13:42.994 --> 13:44.038
- There may not be a next year
because you

13:44.062 --> 13:45.406
cheated my client out of money,
and now

13:45.430 --> 13:47.008
you're gonna pay him back,
plus his lost revenue,

13:47.032 --> 13:48.276
and any other damages
I can hang on you.

13:48.300 --> 13:49.966
- If I cheated him,
then why would I give

13:50.001 --> 13:54.671
the new guy in town,
your guy, a cut-rate deal?

13:54.706 --> 13:55.638
- What are you talking about?

13:55.674 --> 13:56.884
- My other clients
paid 5% more.

13:56.908 --> 14:00.310
Your client was the one
who actually got a break.

14:00.345 --> 14:01.511
A 30% discount.

14:01.546 --> 14:03.324
- And did the other vintners
know you were doing that?

14:03.348 --> 14:06.316
- We're a community up here,
Mr. Williams.

14:06.351 --> 14:07.550
We protect our own.

14:07.586 --> 14:10.553
So they gave the new guy
a break,

14:10.589 --> 14:11.855
and they took the hit,

14:11.890 --> 14:14.190
so you want to slap me
with a lawsuit?

14:14.226 --> 14:18.595
Go ahead,
and we will just see who wins.

14:23.768 --> 14:25.513
- Look at you sweating it out
in the law library

14:25.537 --> 14:26.836
like a first-year.

14:26.872 --> 14:28.638
I didn't know you could read.

14:28.673 --> 14:29.606
- I'm just looking
at the pictures.

14:29.641 --> 14:31.041
- Then why don't you
let me help you

14:31.076 --> 14:33.343
figure out
how to get that building.

14:33.378 --> 14:34.277
- Excuse me?

14:34.312 --> 14:35.245
- Donna thought you could use

14:35.280 --> 14:36.424
some backup
dealing with David Fox.

14:36.448 --> 14:39.816
- Donna did, or you did?
- What does that mean?

14:39.851 --> 14:41.751
- It means
you want to impress me

14:41.786 --> 14:42.719
so when the time comes,
I'll vote for you.

14:42.754 --> 14:43.720
Well,
let me tell you something,

14:43.755 --> 14:45.255
that's never gonna happen.

14:45.290 --> 14:46.256
- I know that.

14:46.291 --> 14:47.768
And I'm here
because I just might have

14:47.792 --> 14:50.093
a solution to your Fox problem.

14:50.128 --> 14:51.839
So you can either trust me
or you can figure out

14:51.863 --> 14:53.429
how to get out of this
yourself.

14:53.465 --> 14:54.531
But for the record,

14:54.566 --> 14:57.100
not everything I do
comes with a price tag.

14:57.135 --> 14:59.302
- This was Donna's idea?

14:59.337 --> 15:00.637
- Yeah, it was.

15:00.672 --> 15:01.716
- Well, then,
why don't you sit down,

15:01.740 --> 15:03.540
and I'll bring you up to speed.

15:03.575 --> 15:04.440
- I have a better idea.

15:04.476 --> 15:06.910
Why don't I sit down
and tell you

15:06.945 --> 15:09.612
how we're gonna get
that building.

15:10.916 --> 15:11.881
- How did it go?

15:11.917 --> 15:13.983
- Exactly as planned.

15:14.019 --> 15:16.553
- In that case, why don't we
have a drink to celebrate,

15:16.588 --> 15:18.488
and then we'll take care
of everything tomorrow.

15:18.523 --> 15:20.034
- As long as you have
a beer or some scotch,

15:20.058 --> 15:22.036
because I'm not drinking
any more of that vinegar shit.

15:22.060 --> 15:24.227
Don't worry.

15:24.262 --> 15:25.762
Neither am I.

15:28.466 --> 15:30.867
- Robert, I gotta ask.

15:30.902 --> 15:34.304
You're a scotch guy.
You're a lawyer.

15:34.339 --> 15:37.106
Why come up here
to buy a vineyard?

15:37.142 --> 15:39.943
- My sister.

15:39.978 --> 15:42.111
She died years ago.

15:42.147 --> 15:43.357
We used to drink wine together,

15:43.381 --> 15:47.317
and we didn't know shit
about vintage or tannins.

15:47.352 --> 15:49.519
We just knew what we liked.

15:49.554 --> 15:51.721
And when I drink wine,
I think about her.

15:51.756 --> 15:53.523
- I didn't know
you had a sister.

15:53.558 --> 15:55.525
- Well, now you do.

15:55.560 --> 15:58.761
I worked a case with Rachel
last year,

15:58.797 --> 16:00.330
got me thinking about her
even more.

16:00.365 --> 16:01.898
And I realized...

16:03.435 --> 16:05.535
I like thinking about her
even more.

16:05.570 --> 16:07.515
- Then here's to making sure
you're thinking of her

16:07.539 --> 16:09.205
till you're old and gray.

16:09.241 --> 16:11.774
- Got that right.

16:15.714 --> 16:18.481
- Oh, thanks for making time
for me, Esther.

16:18.516 --> 16:19.282
I really appreciate it.

16:19.317 --> 16:20.950
- I have to tell you, Louis,

16:20.986 --> 16:23.753
I haven't stopped smiling
since you told me the news.

16:23.788 --> 16:24.988
Have you told Mom and Dad?

16:25.023 --> 16:27.390
- Actually, that's the reason
I wanted to talk to you.

16:27.425 --> 16:29.959
- Okay.
- Sheila and I were talking.

16:29.995 --> 16:32.295
We're not
raising the baby Jewish.

16:32.330 --> 16:34.697
I need you to help me
explain that to Mom and Dad,

16:34.733 --> 16:37.433
and I need to know
how upset you think they'll be.

16:37.469 --> 16:38.613
- How much would it upset you

16:38.637 --> 16:41.604
to be ostracized by them
for the rest of your life?

16:41.640 --> 16:43.773
- Tell you the truth,
I could think of worse things.

16:43.808 --> 16:45.508
- Louis.

16:45.543 --> 16:48.111
It would crush them,
and you know it.

16:48.146 --> 16:49.345
You're Jewish.

16:49.381 --> 16:50.913
You should
raise your children Jewish.

16:50.949 --> 16:52.649
- Wait a second, wait a second.

16:54.419 --> 16:56.352
You feel the same way too?

16:56.388 --> 16:57.965
- I think
this is between you and Sheila.

16:57.989 --> 17:00.356
It's not up to me.

17:00.392 --> 17:02.458
But if you want the truth,
I always thought

17:02.494 --> 17:05.161
if you ever had kids, that
they would go to Camp Brucha

17:05.195 --> 17:07.163
like mine did,
like you and I did.

17:07.198 --> 17:09.332
- I know. I do too.
Remember?

17:09.367 --> 17:11.701
♪ Because... ♪

17:11.736 --> 17:13.303
♪ We're all mishpucha ♪

17:13.338 --> 17:15.438
♪ Here at Camp Brucha ♪

17:15.473 --> 17:17.073
- Anyway,
that's not gonna happen,

17:17.108 --> 17:18.074
because the way
this whole thing started,

17:18.108 --> 17:18.907
when I brought up Brucha
to Sheila,

17:18.943 --> 17:21.444
she nearly choked on her water.

17:21.479 --> 17:23.445
- Wait a second,
she's driving this?

17:23.481 --> 17:24.724
- Of course she is.
You think I want this?

17:24.749 --> 17:25.960
I just said
the goddamn camp pledge.

17:25.983 --> 17:28.251
- Then you need to tell her
how you're feeling.

17:28.286 --> 17:29.297
- I tried
talking to her about it.

17:29.321 --> 17:31.187
She made it clear
she didn't want to,

17:31.222 --> 17:33.289
and here we are.

17:34.993 --> 17:37.093
Louis, I want to talk to you
about Jeffrey.

17:37.128 --> 17:38.561
- Jeffrey's an asshole.

17:38.596 --> 17:39.696
- No, he's not, Louis.

17:39.731 --> 17:42.332
He's the father of my children,

17:42.367 --> 17:45.134
and the reason
our marriage fell apart

17:45.170 --> 17:47.503
wasn't because of
what he did to me

17:47.539 --> 17:51.174
but because of what
he didn't do with me.

17:51.209 --> 17:53.120
- Express how he felt about
you being the breadwinner.

17:53.144 --> 17:54.043
- Yes.

17:54.079 --> 17:56.312
So if you want me
to help you break the news

17:56.348 --> 17:59.515
to Mom and Dad, I will,
but I'm not gonna do it

17:59.551 --> 18:01.784
until you tell Sheila
how you're feeling.

18:05.975 --> 18:07.185
- All right,
what do we have here?

18:07.209 --> 18:08.289
- I'll tell you what we have.

18:08.290 --> 18:09.367
I got a building;
I don't want to sell it;

18:09.391 --> 18:10.935
and these two are in here
crying to you.

18:10.959 --> 18:12.158
- You don't have a lawyer?

18:12.194 --> 18:13.434
- I don't need
a goddamn lawyer.

18:13.462 --> 18:14.394
- We're not crying.

18:14.429 --> 18:16.167
We are representing
the community.

18:16.168 --> 18:18.316
Because that building
was built in 1896,

18:18.317 --> 18:19.983
and all we're asking for
is a TRO

18:20.018 --> 18:22.507
until the landmark commission
can make a decision.

18:22.508 --> 18:23.474
- Give me a break.

18:23.509 --> 18:25.376
They're not representing
the community.

18:25.411 --> 18:26.377
They're representing David Fox.

18:26.412 --> 18:28.746
- I did not say
he was my client.

18:28.781 --> 18:30.347
- And even if he did,
that doesn't mean

18:30.383 --> 18:32.149
this is connected to that.

18:32.184 --> 18:34.852
- How about the fact
that Mr. Fox has been shoveling

18:34.887 --> 18:36.954
my biggest tenant
tens of thousands of dollars

18:36.989 --> 18:41.091
a month to stay in his lease
so I couldn't kick him out?

18:41.127 --> 18:42.192
Is that connected?

18:42.228 --> 18:43.494
- What?
- Your Honor.

18:43.529 --> 18:46.397
Those payments are repayments
for an unrelated debt.

18:46.432 --> 18:47.676
- Bullshit.
Peter Minto doesn't have

18:47.700 --> 18:49.333
two pennies to rub together,

18:49.368 --> 18:51.869
much less tens of thousands
to loan David Fox.

18:51.904 --> 18:54.905
- And the details of someone's
personal financial arrangements

18:54.940 --> 18:56.373
are not your business.

18:56.409 --> 18:57.409
- That's enough.

18:57.443 --> 18:59.109
You two want to push this
up the hill

18:59.145 --> 19:01.245
with the landmark commission,
be my guest,

19:01.280 --> 19:02.557
but I see no reason
to stop this man

19:02.581 --> 19:03.592
from making a living
in the meantime.

19:03.616 --> 19:05.416
Your restraining order
is denied.

19:08.940 --> 19:09.705
- Okay, what we need to do--

19:09.741 --> 19:11.140
- How the hell did you find out

19:11.176 --> 19:12.742
about those payments?

19:12.777 --> 19:13.777
I'll tell you how.

19:13.812 --> 19:15.611
You went to Fox behind my back.

19:15.647 --> 19:17.613
- No.
I had your back.

19:17.649 --> 19:19.415
You had nothing.
I brought you something.

19:19.451 --> 19:21.451
- Well, that something
just blew up in our faces,

19:21.486 --> 19:22.530
because he's been using
those payments

19:22.554 --> 19:25.021
to launder money,
peddle influence,

19:25.056 --> 19:26.322
or God knows what other crime.

19:26.357 --> 19:28.724
- And that is exactly why
I didn't tell you,

19:28.760 --> 19:30.793
because Donna told me
you don't trust him.

19:30.829 --> 19:32.695
- You're damn right
I don't trust him.

19:32.730 --> 19:34.964
Because when a man like that
hides money,

19:34.999 --> 19:37.333
it's not because he's
secretly donating to Goodwill.

19:37.368 --> 19:38.968
- Harvey, he is our client.

19:39.003 --> 19:40.236
- No. He's not.

19:40.271 --> 19:43.105
- You can't just drop him.
- Yes, I can.

19:43.141 --> 19:44.785
Because I don't give a shit
about Donna's deal.

19:44.809 --> 19:48.644
I'm not representing a client
that lies to my face!

19:52.779 --> 19:54.613
What's the matter,
Mr. Newton?

19:54.648 --> 19:55.659
You don't look happy
to be here.

19:55.683 --> 19:56.683
- I'm not.

19:56.717 --> 19:58.617
I don't appreciate
being subpoenaed.

19:58.856 --> 20:00.589
- Well,
if you don't appreciate that,

20:00.590 --> 20:02.310
you're definitely not
gonna appreciate this.

20:05.729 --> 20:07.795
- You're accusing my client
of intent to defraud?

20:07.831 --> 20:08.696
- That's what he did, isn't it?

20:08.732 --> 20:09.831
- I didn't do anything

20:09.866 --> 20:12.166
except be a little bit late
with your barrels.

20:12.202 --> 20:13.245
- What you did
was entice my client

20:13.269 --> 20:14.580
with a discount,
then sabotage his yield

20:14.604 --> 20:15.570
because you knew
the other vintners

20:15.605 --> 20:17.805
would make you whole.

20:17.841 --> 20:19.640
- My client did no such thing.
- Yes, he did.

20:19.676 --> 20:21.420
He admitted it to my face
last night, and now,

20:21.444 --> 20:22.377
instead of a lawsuit,

20:22.412 --> 20:24.278
you're looking
at criminal charges.

20:24.314 --> 20:26.214
- Criminal charges?
Are you out of your mind?

20:26.249 --> 20:27.682
They can't do this to me,
can they?

20:27.717 --> 20:28.683
- Look at his face.

20:28.718 --> 20:29.684
It says we can.

20:29.719 --> 20:32.053
It should be more than that,
you son of a bitch.

20:32.088 --> 20:32.954
- What the hell
is your problem?

20:32.989 --> 20:34.166
- You know what my problem is?

20:34.190 --> 20:36.491
The oldest problem in the book
for a man like me.

20:36.526 --> 20:37.870
And I'm putting a stop to it
right now.

20:37.894 --> 20:41.329
- Race? Race, is that what
you think this is about?

20:41.364 --> 20:43.364
- I know
that's what this is about.

20:43.400 --> 20:44.699
- Oh, you pompous
piece of shit.

20:44.734 --> 20:46.334
- Miles.
- No, no.

20:46.369 --> 20:48.347
I am not gonna sit here
and let him accuse me of that.

20:48.371 --> 20:50.538
You want to know why
you didn't get your barrels?

20:50.573 --> 20:52.106
Because you don't deserve them.

20:52.142 --> 20:53.875
- And there it is.
- No, no, no, no.

20:53.910 --> 20:54.954
See, our families have worked

20:54.978 --> 20:56.477
those vineyards
for generations,

20:56.513 --> 20:58.346
and you just come
waltzing in here

20:58.381 --> 21:01.015
with your Wall Street money,
acting like you own the place,

21:01.050 --> 21:02.817
and you've been here
for, what, ten minutes?

21:02.852 --> 21:05.086
We've been here
our whole lives.

21:05.121 --> 21:07.188
You bought out that man
before you

21:07.223 --> 21:09.657
after he had one down year.

21:09.692 --> 21:11.492
And we're not gonna let you
get away with it.

21:11.528 --> 21:13.428
- You tell yourself
whatever you want.

21:13.463 --> 21:15.296
But you're right
about one thing.

21:15.331 --> 21:17.064
I'm a big, bad motherfucker,

21:17.100 --> 21:20.034
and I'm here to drink
your goddamn milkshake.

21:30.746 --> 21:31.712
- Let me guess,
Samantha told you

21:31.747 --> 21:33.614
what I'm about to do.
- Yeah, she did.

21:33.649 --> 21:35.082
- Oh, so she keeps shit from me

21:35.117 --> 21:35.883
but shares it with you.

21:35.918 --> 21:36.884
- Don't make this about her.

21:36.919 --> 21:38.919
She does what she wants,
just like you do.

21:38.954 --> 21:40.665
- You're taking her side?
- I'm taking my side.

21:40.689 --> 21:42.389
Because you may be done
with this case,

21:42.425 --> 21:43.502
but she's
gonna keep working on it

21:43.526 --> 21:45.893
because, unlike you,
she cares about my reputation.

21:45.928 --> 21:47.239
- You think
I don't care about you?

21:47.263 --> 21:49.496
You're in your position
because I put you there.

21:49.532 --> 21:50.772
- No, Harvey,
I'm in my position

21:50.800 --> 21:53.600
because I fucking earned it!

21:53.636 --> 21:55.936
Now, if you want to talk
about things you did,

21:55.971 --> 21:58.072
you authorized me
to negotiate this deal,

21:58.107 --> 22:00.607
and if you don't honor it,
Fox is gonna tell the world,

22:00.643 --> 22:01.686
and how's that gonna go
the next time

22:01.710 --> 22:03.577
I try to come to an agreement
with anyone?

22:03.612 --> 22:05.846
- It'll go fine
because he has no integrity.

22:05.881 --> 22:08.015
Nobody will believe him.
- Okay.

22:08.050 --> 22:11.819
Let me put this in words
that you'll understand.

22:11.854 --> 22:13.687
I have integrity.

22:13.722 --> 22:15.856
You let him go,
you're making me a liar.

22:15.891 --> 22:17.069
- You want to talk
about a liar?

22:17.093 --> 22:18.659
He lied to my face.

22:18.694 --> 22:19.974
- And so have
a thousand other clients.

22:19.975 --> 22:21.505
You were just waiting
for an opportunity

22:21.506 --> 22:22.783
to let him go.
- Because we never

22:22.807 --> 22:24.210
should've taken him
on in the first place.

22:24.211 --> 22:25.571
- Well, we did,
and like I said,

22:25.572 --> 22:27.412
you drop him,
you're making me a liar.

22:27.413 --> 22:29.243
And I don't care if the rest
of the world knows it or not.

22:29.244 --> 22:32.211
You'll know it,
and I'll know it.

22:32.247 --> 22:33.846
Now, you go ahead
and do what you want.

22:33.882 --> 22:35.848
You always do anyway.

22:43.524 --> 22:46.692
- Louis, what a surprise.
I was just reading.

22:46.728 --> 22:49.729
- Listen.
Sheila... we need to talk.

22:49.764 --> 22:50.997
- About what?

22:51.032 --> 22:53.132
- I want to raise
our child Jewish.

22:53.167 --> 22:54.345
- Louis, I thought
we talked about this.

22:54.369 --> 22:55.134
- No, Sheila, we didn't,

22:55.169 --> 22:55.935
because we were celebrating,

22:55.970 --> 22:56.736
and you told me to let it go.

22:56.771 --> 22:58.838
And I tried to let it go,

22:58.873 --> 22:59.839
but then I talked to Esther.

22:59.874 --> 23:01.274
And now I can't.

23:01.309 --> 23:02.275
- Okay, so you talked to Esther

23:02.310 --> 23:04.043
after you said
we wouldn't tell anyone yet?

23:04.078 --> 23:06.913
- Yes, I did,
because she's my family.

23:06.948 --> 23:08.058
- I get it,
so you and your sister

23:08.082 --> 23:11.684
have a long conversation
about Sheila, the shiksa.

23:11.719 --> 23:12.730
- Sheila, it's not like that.

23:12.754 --> 23:15.955
Esther helped me realize
that I don't care

23:15.990 --> 23:17.056
what my parents think.

23:17.091 --> 23:18.958
I don't care what
your parents think.

23:18.993 --> 23:20.104
It's what's important to me.

23:20.128 --> 23:21.272
- And how about
what's important to me?

23:21.296 --> 23:22.706
- That's why
I want to talk this out.

23:22.730 --> 23:26.265
Because I don't want to end up
resenting you for this.

23:26.301 --> 23:27.478
- And I don't want
to resent you either,

23:27.502 --> 23:31.370
so why don't you tell me why
this is so important to you.

23:31.406 --> 23:34.340
- What's so important is that
it's a part of who I am.

23:34.375 --> 23:37.109
- And being Catholic
is a part of who I am.

23:37.145 --> 23:38.489
- But you said
you were not religious.

23:38.513 --> 23:39.478
- And so did you.

23:39.514 --> 23:43.082
- That's what I am trying
to explain to you.

23:43.117 --> 23:47.486
Being Jewish
isn't just a religion to me.

23:47.522 --> 23:48.988
It's in my blood.

23:49.023 --> 23:50.100
- And you don't think
it's the same for me?

23:50.124 --> 23:51.535
- No, I don't.
- Then you don't get it.

23:51.559 --> 23:54.293
Because when I said
my parents wouldn't like this,

23:54.329 --> 23:57.363
what I meant was,
the people who raised me,

23:57.398 --> 24:00.866
who are my blood,
have had a hard enough time

24:00.902 --> 24:03.102
accepting the fact
that I don't practice anymore.

24:03.137 --> 24:04.971
And I don't want
to separate myself from them

24:05.006 --> 24:06.973
by telling them that my child

24:07.008 --> 24:10.142
is going to be different
than all of us.

24:10.178 --> 24:11.255
- Sheila, I can't just
rip this out of me.

24:11.279 --> 24:13.980
- Louis, I'm not asking you
to rip it out of you.

24:14.015 --> 24:16.716
I just don't want to raise
our child one way or another.

24:16.751 --> 24:18.718
- You know what, to me,
it's the same damn thing.

24:18.753 --> 24:19.897
- Then I don't know
what to tell you.

24:19.921 --> 24:21.687
- Neither do I.

24:25.460 --> 24:27.193
Neither do I.

24:30.297 --> 24:32.564
- Samantha, can I talk to you
for a minute?

24:32.600 --> 24:34.700
- Looks like you need
more than that.

24:34.735 --> 24:37.302
- I tried to talk Harvey
out of dropping Fox,

24:37.338 --> 24:39.004
but I'm not sure
I convinced him.

24:39.039 --> 24:40.405
- And?
- I told him you said

24:40.441 --> 24:42.407
you'd keep working on the case
anyway.

24:42.443 --> 24:44.376
- That's funny,
because I didn't say that.

24:44.411 --> 24:46.645
- No. You didn't.

24:46.680 --> 24:47.924
But the reason
I told him you did is--

24:47.948 --> 24:49.226
- Because you gave Fox
your word.

24:49.250 --> 24:51.984
And even if Harvey doesn't
live up to it, I can.

24:52.019 --> 24:53.785
- Exactly.

24:53.821 --> 24:55.131
- It looks like I've got
some more work to do.

24:55.155 --> 24:57.789
Because I'm not gonna
make a liar out of you.

24:57.825 --> 25:00.425
- Thank you, Samantha.
- No need to thank me, Donna.

25:00.461 --> 25:03.395
I'm sure
you'd do the same for me.

25:05.299 --> 25:08.600
- Louis, what's going on?

25:08.636 --> 25:12.070
It's not usual for you to come
in so many times in one week.

25:12.106 --> 25:14.239
What did Harvey get into now?

25:14.275 --> 25:15.552
- This isn't about Harvey.
It's about Sheila.

25:15.576 --> 25:18.343
I need you to convince her
to raise our children Jewish.

25:18.379 --> 25:19.878
- Louis,
I'm not going to do that.

25:19.914 --> 25:21.213
- Why not?

25:21.248 --> 25:22.626
I know she came
to see you that time.

25:22.650 --> 25:24.528
Did you think I wouldn't
find out about that one?

25:24.552 --> 25:25.762
- No,
I assumed you would find out

25:25.786 --> 25:28.153
when I explicitly told her
to tell you about it.

25:28.188 --> 25:29.432
- Well, if you can order her
to do that,

25:29.456 --> 25:31.957
why can't you order her
to raise our children Jewish?

25:31.992 --> 25:34.626
What kind of therapist are you?

25:34.662 --> 25:36.228
- Louis.

25:36.263 --> 25:38.163
I know
I've told you this before,

25:38.198 --> 25:39.965
and I know
you refuse to believe me,

25:40.000 --> 25:42.301
but my parents were Jews
in Nazi Germany,

25:42.336 --> 25:43.380
and there was a point for them

25:43.404 --> 25:46.104
where they discussed
renouncing their Judaism

25:46.140 --> 25:47.873
for a chance
to save their lives.

25:47.908 --> 25:49.808
They didn't.

25:49.843 --> 25:52.911
So I understand
as much as anyone

25:52.947 --> 25:55.781
the value of maintaining
a Jewish identity.

25:55.816 --> 25:57.482
- But?
- But, to me,

25:57.518 --> 26:00.586
the heart of Judaism is family.

26:00.621 --> 26:02.087
- What're you saying?

26:02.122 --> 26:03.333
- I'm saying,
if you can't be on

26:03.357 --> 26:06.892
the same page about how
to raise your children,

26:06.927 --> 26:08.860
maybe you should discuss
not having them.

26:11.599 --> 26:14.266
- It's too late for that.

26:14.301 --> 26:15.233
- Ah.

26:15.269 --> 26:17.169
Then, Louis,

26:17.204 --> 26:19.771
I would say it's more important

26:19.807 --> 26:21.673
that you make a decision
together

26:21.709 --> 26:23.942
than what that decision is.

26:23.978 --> 26:25.510
- Thanks, Stan.

26:25.546 --> 26:27.379
- You're welcome, Louis.

26:27.414 --> 26:31.817
And there's just one more
small matter before we move on.

26:31.852 --> 26:33.719
- What's that?

26:36.023 --> 26:37.322
- Mazel tov, my friend.

26:37.358 --> 26:39.625
Mazel tov.

26:47.934 --> 26:48.766
- Where have you been?

26:48.802 --> 26:50.768
- I gave you a chance
to calm down.

26:50.804 --> 26:51.948
Because, Robert,
we need to talk.

26:51.972 --> 26:53.538
- We do.

26:53.573 --> 26:55.607
About how
we're gonna make them pay.

26:55.642 --> 26:56.708
- That's the thing.

26:56.743 --> 26:58.710
I think we should try
to work this out.

26:58.745 --> 27:00.612
- Are you goddamn kidding me?

27:00.647 --> 27:01.724
- Robert, he admitted
to a crime

27:01.748 --> 27:03.748
to convince us
he was telling us the truth.

27:03.783 --> 27:05.294
- Because he probably believes
his own bullshit.

27:05.318 --> 27:07.085
Well, I don't care
what he believes.

27:07.120 --> 27:09.187
There's no way, if I'm white,

27:09.222 --> 27:10.188
we're in this situation
right now.

27:10.223 --> 27:12.557
- I'm not gonna tell you
you're wrong.

27:12.592 --> 27:14.537
But you are wrong about
how to handle this situation.

27:14.561 --> 27:16.094
- What is that
supposed to mean?

27:16.129 --> 27:17.829
- It means
we take him at his word.

27:17.864 --> 27:19.898
- Okay.

27:19.933 --> 27:21.533
Let's say that you're right

27:21.568 --> 27:24.702
and this is more about my money
than the color of my skin.

27:24.738 --> 27:26.371
I'm not gonna let
that son of a bitch

27:26.406 --> 27:28.339
push me out
no matter what the reason.

27:28.375 --> 27:29.385
I've been putting up
with this shit

27:29.409 --> 27:31.476
for more years
than you've been on this earth,

27:31.511 --> 27:33.411
and I've accepted
that the way to deal with it

27:33.446 --> 27:34.646
is to bury a part of myself.

27:34.681 --> 27:36.314
Well, I don't
have to do that anymore,

27:36.349 --> 27:37.393
and you're gonna do what I say.

27:37.417 --> 27:38.383
- No, sir, I'm not,

27:38.418 --> 27:40.084
because the world's
a shitty place

27:40.120 --> 27:41.230
and I'm not
gonna make it worse.

27:41.254 --> 27:42.865
And I don't give a shit
if you're my boss.

27:42.889 --> 27:43.855
I'm your goddamn lawyer.

27:43.890 --> 27:44.789
And you're either
gonna take my advice

27:44.824 --> 27:47.091
or you can hire someone else.

27:47.127 --> 27:49.272
- Then call yourself a car,
and get the hell out of here.

27:49.296 --> 27:50.395
I'll handle it myself.

28:01.093 --> 28:02.973
I hope you're here to tell me
you got it done.

28:03.209 --> 28:05.003
- I'm here to give you
one last chance.

28:05.004 --> 28:06.842
'Cause I know
about the payments

28:06.843 --> 28:09.469
to Peter Minto,
and so does Billows.

28:11.109 --> 28:12.565
- Shit.

28:13.083 --> 28:13.991
Well, how much does he know?

28:13.992 --> 28:15.135
- I'm not here
about what he knows.

28:15.159 --> 28:17.190
I'm here about what I don't,
because I asked you

28:17.191 --> 28:19.580
if something shady is going on,
you lied to my face,

28:19.581 --> 28:21.602
and the only reason
I haven't dropped you yet

28:21.603 --> 28:22.735
is Donna gave you her word.

28:22.771 --> 28:24.124
- You know what,
you wouldn't understand.

28:24.125 --> 28:25.615
- I understand
money laundering,

28:25.616 --> 28:27.375
and, knowing the kind
of man you are,

28:27.376 --> 28:29.008
it's exactly what's
going on here.

28:29.044 --> 28:30.871
- You know, you don't know shit
about the kind of man I am.

28:30.872 --> 28:31.971
- Then tell me right now.

28:32.007 --> 28:33.740
What the hell
is Peter Minto giving you

28:33.775 --> 28:36.275
in exchange
for $10,000 a month?

28:40.015 --> 28:41.415
It was nice
representing you, David.

28:42.684 --> 28:44.320
- It's not what he's giving me.

28:45.556 --> 28:48.156
It's what he gave me.

28:48.191 --> 28:49.891
- What does that mean?

28:51.929 --> 28:53.828
- I was 13 years old.
I didn't have any money.

28:53.864 --> 28:55.697
I needed a pack of cigarettes.

28:55.732 --> 28:57.966
So I took one
from Minto's Market.

28:58.001 --> 28:59.579
And then I thought, you know,
while I'm at it,

28:59.603 --> 29:01.047
I might as well take
a bunch of other shit.

29:01.071 --> 29:02.382
- He didn't press charges.
- No, he didn't.

29:02.406 --> 29:04.639
But he did make me work it off.

29:04.675 --> 29:06.209
Next thing I knew,
he took me under his wing.

29:06.210 --> 29:09.144
Look, I gave him that money
because if I didn't,

29:09.179 --> 29:10.412
he'd go out of business,

29:10.447 --> 29:11.947
and if I can't
get this building,

29:11.982 --> 29:13.193
he's gonna
go out of business anyway.

29:13.217 --> 29:15.526
- Why didn't you just tell me
this in the first place?

29:15.527 --> 29:19.796
- For the same reason
I don't want anyone to know it.

29:19.831 --> 29:22.599
All right, I need people
to believe that I'm ruthless.

29:22.634 --> 29:25.635
- Well, wouldn't you rather
have people know you're loyal

29:25.670 --> 29:27.503
than have them think
you're an asshole?

29:27.539 --> 29:28.649
- Look, Peter Minto taught me
how to do business

29:28.673 --> 29:29.784
as a gentleman,
but there's a reason

29:29.808 --> 29:32.642
he can't keep his business
alive and I can.

29:32.677 --> 29:33.943
- Well...

29:33.979 --> 29:37.947
I can't say I agree with you...

29:37.983 --> 29:40.450
but I'll get you your building.

29:46.688 --> 29:48.287
<i>- Donna. You're up late.</i>

29:48.323 --> 29:49.800
- I'm up late because you said

29:49.801 --> 29:50.700
this thing would be done
by now,

29:50.735 --> 29:52.535
and I haven't heard from you,

29:52.570 --> 29:55.438
which makes me wonder...
how's it going?

29:55.473 --> 29:56.673
<i>- I'll tell you</i>
<i>how it's going.</i>

29:56.708 --> 29:58.608
Instead of getting closer
with Alex,

29:58.643 --> 30:00.143
I had to send him packing.

30:00.178 --> 30:01.511
<i>- What? How did that happen?</i>

30:01.546 --> 30:02.923
- It happened
because I'm his client

30:02.947 --> 30:05.248
and he wouldn't listen
to a word I said.

30:05.283 --> 30:06.494
- Look,
I want to say something,

30:06.518 --> 30:07.795
but I'm hesitant to say it
because it's not something

30:07.819 --> 30:09.263
I would normally say
to a managing partner.

30:09.287 --> 30:12.422
- Speak your mind.
<i>- Well, I don't know</i>

30:12.457 --> 30:13.956
<i>what the issue is,</i>
<i>but I do know</i>

30:13.992 --> 30:15.469
when a lawyer and a client
have a falling out,

30:15.493 --> 30:18.428
more often than not,
it's because

30:18.463 --> 30:19.774
the client wouldn't listen
to the lawyer,

30:19.798 --> 30:20.997
<i>not the other way around.</i>

30:21.032 --> 30:23.032
<i>In particular,</i>
<i>when that lawyer</i>

30:23.067 --> 30:24.634
<i>is Alex Williams.</i>

30:24.669 --> 30:25.968
- Is that all?
<i>- That's it.</i>

30:26.004 --> 30:29.505
I hope you get whatever it is
taken care of, Robert.

30:33.678 --> 30:35.311
- Are you still working
the Fox case?

30:35.346 --> 30:37.079
- I believe
Donna told you I was,

30:37.115 --> 30:39.782
and Donna's no liar, why?

30:39.818 --> 30:42.018
- Because I'm back in.

30:42.053 --> 30:43.330
- What changed your mind?
- Fox did.

30:43.354 --> 30:47.089
Turns out those payments
were because Peter Minto

30:47.125 --> 30:48.257
was Fox's mentor.

30:48.293 --> 30:49.437
He wasn't laundering anything.

30:49.461 --> 30:50.827
He was trying
to save that market.

30:50.862 --> 30:54.096
- So he was basically donating
to Goodwill after all.

30:54.132 --> 30:55.631
- I guess he was.

30:55.667 --> 30:57.733
- Wait a minute.

30:57.769 --> 30:59.402
Goodwill.

30:59.437 --> 31:01.270
Public good.
- What do you got?

31:01.306 --> 31:02.416
- There's a public good
requirement for any project.

31:02.440 --> 31:04.340
- Yeah, and this one
has it covered

31:04.375 --> 31:05.641
with the subsidized housing.

31:05.677 --> 31:06.509
- Because that way,

31:06.544 --> 31:08.311
his Chinese investors
have to cover it.

31:08.346 --> 31:09.312
- How do you know that?

31:09.347 --> 31:10.724
- Because I got a copy
of their agreement,

31:10.748 --> 31:11.981
and if that good

31:12.016 --> 31:13.127
is residential,
they take the hit.

31:13.151 --> 31:14.228
If it's commercial,
Billows does,

31:14.252 --> 31:18.054
and Minto's Market
is a commercial public good.

31:18.089 --> 31:20.790
- Which means all we need to do
is tell those Chinese investors

31:20.825 --> 31:22.525
their trusted partner's
been screwing them.

31:22.560 --> 31:24.193
- And Billows either loses
his partners

31:24.229 --> 31:25.394
or foots the bill himself.

31:25.430 --> 31:28.130
which puts him between a rock
and a hard place.

31:28.166 --> 31:31.968
- And his only way out
is to sell to David Fox.

31:32.003 --> 31:32.935
- Look at that.

31:32.971 --> 31:35.071
We make a pretty good team,
don't we?

31:35.106 --> 31:36.906
- Maybe.

31:36.941 --> 31:38.140
But the only problem is,

31:38.176 --> 31:41.377
it makes this whole project
a money loser for Fox.

31:41.412 --> 31:43.679
- So what? He said he's been
subsidizing Minto anyway.

31:43.715 --> 31:45.715
- Privately.
This is in the public eye,

31:45.750 --> 31:47.027
which means
everyone's gonna think

31:47.051 --> 31:49.685
he's either soft or stupid,
and I'm telling you,

31:49.721 --> 31:51.420
it's that man's
worst nightmare.

31:51.456 --> 31:53.356
- What do you want to do?

31:53.391 --> 31:54.891
- Can you get to the Chinese?
- I can.

31:56.828 --> 31:59.529
- You handle them,
and I'll handle David Fox.

31:59.564 --> 32:01.764
- Sounds like a plan.

32:03.268 --> 32:05.201
- Are you sure
you can handle them?

32:05.236 --> 32:06.569
<i>- Ni gan dadu wo keyi.</i>

32:06.604 --> 32:09.572
- Yeah,
but can you handle them?

32:19.183 --> 32:21.617
- What now?
- I'm calling to say I'm sorry.

32:21.653 --> 32:22.385
I lost my shit.

32:22.420 --> 32:23.286
<i>- Truth is,</i>

32:23.321 --> 32:24.854
<i>if I was in your position,</i>

32:24.889 --> 32:26.289
I'd probably feel the same way.

32:26.324 --> 32:27.690
<i>- Well,</i>
<i>you're not in my position.</i>

32:27.725 --> 32:28.691
<i>You're my lawyer.</i>

32:28.726 --> 32:29.904
And if I'm not
gonna listen to you

32:29.928 --> 32:31.961
and go ahead
and handle this thing myself...

32:31.996 --> 32:33.996
- You've got a fool
for a client.

32:35.700 --> 32:37.767
- Something like that.

32:37.802 --> 32:39.802
Anyway, I think I may
have a way through this.

32:39.837 --> 32:40.636
- What you got?

32:40.672 --> 32:42.004
<i>- You said that you wanted</i>

32:42.040 --> 32:42.872
<i>to take them at their word.</i>

32:42.907 --> 32:44.707
If we did that, the problem is,

32:44.742 --> 32:48.778
we're dealing with a community
that feels threatened.

32:48.813 --> 32:50.012
So I was thinking,

32:50.048 --> 32:52.448
insurance covers my losses
this year.

32:52.483 --> 32:54.016
<i>Next year,</i>
<i>my barrels are free,</i>

32:54.052 --> 32:56.752
and then I can build
a community tasting room

32:56.788 --> 32:57.887
that we all can share.

32:57.922 --> 32:58.966
<i>- That's very generous of you,</i>
<i>Robert.</i>

32:58.990 --> 33:00.401
Mind if I ask you
what brought you around?

33:00.425 --> 33:04.827
<i>- Two things.</i>
<i>A conversation with a friend.</i>

33:04.862 --> 33:06.395
<i>- And?</i>

33:06.431 --> 33:09.932
- Where I grew up,
community was everything.

33:09.968 --> 33:11.934
We were tight and close,

33:11.970 --> 33:15.638
mistrusting of outsiders,
and...

33:15.673 --> 33:18.574
if someone had come in
and done what I did to them...

33:20.845 --> 33:23.079
<i>The community wouldn't</i>
<i>have taken too kindly to it,</i>

33:23.114 --> 33:24.780
no matter what
the color of their skin.

33:26.884 --> 33:30.419
So I thought maybe we're not
so different after all.

33:30.455 --> 33:31.587
- Copy that.

33:31.623 --> 33:34.190
- So you're gonna propose
all of that to them tomorrow.

33:34.225 --> 33:35.558
<i>- Robert, I think</i>

33:35.593 --> 33:37.393
if you're gonna be
a part of this community,

33:37.428 --> 33:38.772
we ought to propose it
to them together.

33:38.796 --> 33:40.007
<i>- So get your ass</i>
<i>back up here then.</i>

33:40.031 --> 33:45.401
And Alex... don't ever
call me a fool again.

33:52.543 --> 33:55.478
- Welcome home, Louis.

33:55.513 --> 33:56.579
- Is that...

33:56.614 --> 33:59.015
- Yes, it is.

33:59.050 --> 34:00.583
Your mother's kugel.

34:00.618 --> 34:02.218
- How did you...

34:02.253 --> 34:04.987
- Your sister called.
- Don't tell me.

34:05.023 --> 34:06.233
She tried to convince you
to see it my way.

34:06.257 --> 34:08.190
- No, Louis, she called

34:08.226 --> 34:09.558
to tell me, whatever happens,

34:09.594 --> 34:10.760
she loves me

34:10.795 --> 34:13.496
and wants to welcome me
to the family.

34:13.531 --> 34:14.864
- So why the kugel?

34:14.899 --> 34:16.677
- Because my sister never
would have done that for me.

34:16.701 --> 34:17.667
Louis, I may not be ready

34:17.702 --> 34:18.812
to make this decision
right now,

34:18.835 --> 34:21.871
but what we were
really struggling with

34:21.906 --> 34:24.840
was how to blend
our identities.

34:24.876 --> 34:27.009
So I thought,
what better way to do that

34:27.045 --> 34:29.011
than by starting with kugel?

34:30.481 --> 34:32.782
- Well, if we're gonna
be doing that,

34:32.817 --> 34:33.683
I don't see
why we can't also have

34:33.717 --> 34:36.118
a Christmas tree this year.

34:36.154 --> 34:37.987
- You'd be open to that?
- Yes, I would.

34:39.824 --> 34:41.456
Because I saw
Dr. Lipschitz today.

34:41.492 --> 34:43.793
Sheila, he reminded me

34:43.828 --> 34:46.295
that the foundation
of everything is family.

34:48.699 --> 34:50.065
So I've been thinking...

34:50.101 --> 34:53.101
- Stop right there.
I've been thinking too.

34:53.137 --> 34:56.572
You asked me last time.

34:56.607 --> 34:59.175
I'd like to ask you this time.

35:02.613 --> 35:04.814
Louis Marlowe Litt...

35:06.517 --> 35:08.317
Will you marry me?

35:08.352 --> 35:09.719
- Yes, Sheila, I will.

35:21.534 --> 35:22.567
- Morning.

35:22.602 --> 35:24.802
I was just thinking
about our wedding.

35:24.838 --> 35:25.937
- Louis...

35:25.972 --> 35:29.407
- I was thinking maybe
we can make it a destination.

35:29.442 --> 35:31.420
- I don't want to talk
about our wedding right now.

35:31.444 --> 35:32.343
- Why not?

35:32.379 --> 35:34.746
- I got my period.
I'm not pregnant.

35:34.781 --> 35:37.415
- But the test said that you--
- It was a false positive.

35:39.519 --> 35:40.718
- Hey.

35:40.754 --> 35:44.722
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

35:44.758 --> 35:45.590
You know what this is?

35:45.625 --> 35:48.192
It's just a bump in the road.

35:48.228 --> 35:49.727
That's all this is.

35:49.763 --> 35:52.563
Just a pause.

35:52.599 --> 35:54.065
And sweetie,
there's a bright side.

35:54.100 --> 35:55.111
Because it gave us a chance

35:55.135 --> 35:58.236
to have
really tough conversations.

35:58.271 --> 36:00.338
And that way,
when we do get pregnant,

36:00.373 --> 36:04.876
and we will get pregnant,

36:04.911 --> 36:08.312
we'll be ready in a way
that we weren't ready before.

36:13.453 --> 36:15.920
Are you okay?

36:15.955 --> 36:18.723
- I will be.

36:18.758 --> 36:21.726
Please tell me you didn't tell
anyone other than Esther.

36:22.829 --> 36:24.929
- I told Gretchen.

36:24.964 --> 36:27.031
- You need to untell her that.

36:34.007 --> 36:35.073
- Hello, Robert.

36:35.108 --> 36:37.408
I assume you're calling me
with good news.

36:37.444 --> 36:38.643
<i>- How do you know that?</i>

36:38.678 --> 36:41.279
- Don't you know by now I have
a sense for these things?

36:41.314 --> 36:43.577
- I just wanted to call
and say thank you, Donna.

36:43.578 --> 36:44.443
We worked it out.

36:44.479 --> 36:45.378
<i>- You and Alex?</i>

36:45.413 --> 36:48.781
- Me, Alex, everybody up here.

36:48.816 --> 36:50.783
And it wouldn't have happened

36:50.818 --> 36:52.485
without you calling me
on my shit.

36:52.520 --> 36:54.854
- You know how they say doctors
make the worst patients?

36:54.889 --> 36:55.922
<i>- Same goes for lawyers?</i>

36:55.957 --> 36:58.758
- No.
Lawyers are much worse.

36:58.793 --> 37:00.826
<i>- I guess they are.</i>

37:00.862 --> 37:02.540
Which is why I'm glad
I have someone like you.

37:02.564 --> 37:04.497
<i>- Wow... calling to thank me,</i>

37:04.532 --> 37:05.998
valuing my leadership,
and giving me

37:06.034 --> 37:09.569
an endearing nickname--
Robert, if we're not careful,

37:09.604 --> 37:13.105
we could become
full-blown friends.

37:13.141 --> 37:15.308
- Oh, that's a chance
I'm willing to take.

37:15.343 --> 37:17.143
- See you soon, Pops.

37:17.178 --> 37:18.277
- Right back at you, Red.

37:31.255 --> 37:32.717
<i>- Let me get this straight,</i>
<i>you're telling me</i>

37:32.718 --> 37:34.229
you can get me the building,
but it's gonna

37:34.253 --> 37:35.819
cost me more
to keep Peter in business

37:35.854 --> 37:36.687
than I was paying
in the first place?

37:36.722 --> 37:38.188
- And on top of that,

37:38.223 --> 37:39.634
the whole world's
gonna know about it,

37:39.658 --> 37:41.469
because Billows is gonna
make sure they know it.

37:41.493 --> 37:42.904
- Are you trying
to stick it to me even more?

37:42.928 --> 37:43.860
- I want you to know
the cost of this thing

37:43.896 --> 37:45.696
before you make a decision.

37:45.731 --> 37:46.930
- This is bullshit.

37:46.965 --> 37:47.764
- David.
- God damn it.

37:47.800 --> 37:49.032
You could have done better.

37:49.068 --> 37:50.211
- And you could've told me
the full fucking story

37:50.235 --> 37:53.570
before I only had two days
to stop it.

37:53.605 --> 37:56.640
- So either
I look like a sucker

37:56.675 --> 38:00.110
or I let the guy who gave me
my start go out of business.

38:00.145 --> 38:02.546
- Helping Peter Minto
stay in business

38:02.581 --> 38:04.281
doesn't make you a sucker.

38:04.316 --> 38:06.717
- It does to the world.

38:08.887 --> 38:11.521
- David,
the deal is what it is.

38:11.557 --> 38:15.225
If I could make it any better,
I would, but I can't.

38:18.764 --> 38:19.629
- What would you do?

38:19.665 --> 38:21.498
- As your lawyer, I'd tell you

38:21.533 --> 38:24.634
get your emotions in check.

38:24.670 --> 38:26.536
It's a shitty deal
and a stupid move.

38:26.572 --> 38:29.106
But if I were in your shoes,
I'd take it.

38:33.479 --> 38:35.912
- Take it.

38:35.948 --> 38:37.759
- You know, I never thought
I'd be saying this,

38:37.783 --> 38:42.219
but... you earned my respect.

38:48.393 --> 38:49.804
- Well, don't you look like
the cat that ate the canary.

38:49.828 --> 38:53.063
- I do. And that canary's name
is Robert Zane.

38:53.098 --> 38:54.064
- Let me guess.

38:54.099 --> 38:56.500
He called you and started
unleashing compliments

38:56.535 --> 38:57.567
like you were his family.

38:57.603 --> 38:59.536
- How'd you know?

38:59.571 --> 39:00.871
- He gets like that sometimes.

39:00.906 --> 39:02.672
- Well, I was thinking
that I wanted

39:02.708 --> 39:04.646
to treat him like family
right back,

39:04.647 --> 39:06.124
and maybe you could
give me some advice

39:06.148 --> 39:07.181
on getting him a gift.

39:07.216 --> 39:09.883
- Oh, no, Donna.
You don't want to do that.

39:09.919 --> 39:11.919
- What? Why not?

39:11.954 --> 39:13.687
- He's a terrible
gift receiver.

39:13.723 --> 39:14.855
- You're kidding.

39:14.890 --> 39:16.156
- I once gave him
vintage copies

39:16.192 --> 39:18.292
of "Inherit the Wind,"
"To Kill a Mockingbird,"

39:18.327 --> 39:20.194
and "Twelve Angry Men"
for his birthday.

39:20.229 --> 39:21.962
The next year,
I found them in his drawer

39:21.997 --> 39:24.431
with the bow still tied on.

39:24.467 --> 39:26.834
He's a lawyer.
They're books about the law.

39:26.869 --> 39:28.602
- Did you say something?
- No.

39:28.637 --> 39:29.948
I just took them back.
He didn't even notice.

39:29.972 --> 39:33.006
I'm gonna regift it to him
when he retires.

39:33.042 --> 39:34.842
What?

39:34.877 --> 39:35.976
- Harvey's the opposite.

39:36.011 --> 39:38.379
- Great gift receiver.
- Awful gift giver.

39:38.414 --> 39:40.158
Heart's in the right place,
but two weeks in,

39:40.182 --> 39:41.115
I realized
if I ever really wanted

39:41.150 --> 39:42.950
to enjoy my birthday present,

39:42.985 --> 39:44.262
I was gonna
have to buy it myself.

39:44.286 --> 39:45.252
- Do you still?

39:45.287 --> 39:47.254
- Got these for the last one.

39:47.289 --> 39:49.423
32,
if you're wondering.

39:49.458 --> 39:50.491
Speak of the devil.

39:50.526 --> 39:51.670
Look who's walking in
empty-handed.

39:51.694 --> 39:55.295
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing, Harvey.

39:56.832 --> 39:59.967
- Well, as long as
you're both here,

40:00.002 --> 40:01.969
you weren't just right
about Fox.

40:02.004 --> 40:04.605
You were right about taking him
on in the first place,

40:04.640 --> 40:08.275
and you were also right
about getting her to help me.

40:08.310 --> 40:09.750
- If I didn't know any better,
Donna,

40:09.779 --> 40:11.812
I'd say
he's apologizing to you.

40:11.847 --> 40:13.425
- That's funny, I was thinking
he was apologizing to you.

40:13.449 --> 40:15.127
- Well, I can understand
why we're both confused.

40:15.151 --> 40:16.161
It's a pretty weak apology.

40:16.185 --> 40:18.552
He didn't even use
the word "sorry."

40:18.587 --> 40:20.427
- I don't even think
he knows the word "sorry."

40:20.456 --> 40:21.967
- Are you two finished?
- We're just getting started.

40:21.991 --> 40:23.023
- Take a chair, Harvey.

40:23.058 --> 40:25.036
- And pour us a couple
of drinks while you're at it.

40:25.060 --> 40:26.860
- If I'd known
this was gonna happen,

40:26.896 --> 40:28.996
I wouldn't have said anything,
much less "I'm sorry."

40:29.031 --> 40:31.331
- Ooh, look at that.
He does know the word.

40:31.367 --> 40:34.401
- Yeah, just not how to use it.
- Mm-hmm.

40:39.542 --> 40:42.609
- Louis, where have you been
all day?

40:44.814 --> 40:46.947
- I needed to spend some time
with Sheila.

40:46.982 --> 40:48.782
- Well, I've got good news.

40:48.818 --> 40:51.084
I found a midwife class
for you.

40:51.120 --> 40:53.253
Turns out, you're not the only
mid-aged white man

40:53.289 --> 40:55.989
that wants to be
Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman.

40:56.025 --> 40:57.958
- That's great.

40:57.993 --> 41:00.461
But I'm gonna need you
to cancel it.

41:00.496 --> 41:04.431
- Louis, what's wrong?

41:04.467 --> 41:07.301
- It was a false positive.

41:07.336 --> 41:08.535
We're not gonna have a baby.

41:08.571 --> 41:10.671
- I'm so sorry.

41:10.706 --> 41:11.850
But that doesn't mean
that she--

41:11.874 --> 41:12.773
- I know that, Gretchen.

41:12.808 --> 41:15.008
I just need a little time
to myself.

41:15.044 --> 41:16.477
- Of course.

41:18.214 --> 41:21.148
You don't have to be strong
for me, Louis.
