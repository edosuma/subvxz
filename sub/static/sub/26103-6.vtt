00:02.000 --> 00:03.240
- Danny Lyons.
- His mum found him.

00:03.280 --> 00:05.000
- Killed himself.
- What,

00:05.040 --> 00:07.080
he puts three people in the hospital,

00:07.120 --> 00:08.760
but we're bullying him?

00:08.800 --> 00:10.720
- I want to deliver it myself.
- That's not possible.

00:10.760 --> 00:13.800
It's his birthday, and you can't see him,
cos you've split up with your wife.

00:13.840 --> 00:17.440
She's sleeping with a billionaire banker.
They've hired lawyers to cut me out.

00:17.480 --> 00:21.040
Danny's mum - she needs to be endorsing
our campaign in two hours.

00:21.080 --> 00:22.760
Get her on video conference. Record it.

00:22.800 --> 00:24.800
- No.

00:24.840 --> 00:29.160
In two weeks' time,
the Herald will become a free paper.

00:29.200 --> 00:30.680
- I want to write about the Post.

00:30.720 --> 00:34.480
The piece would expose all of it, how they
operate and, at the centre of it,

00:34.520 --> 00:37.160
that horrific man. He even has a safe
where he keeps stories.

00:37.200 --> 00:38.120
Did you see it?

00:38.160 --> 00:40.120
- Yeah, he gave me something from it.

00:40.160 --> 00:41.480
All it said was "Resonance".

00:41.520 --> 00:42.680
Remember that man who came forward,

00:42.720 --> 00:45.880
said he worked for MI5? What was the name
of the programme he told you about?

00:45.920 --> 00:46.960
Resonance.

01:46.520 --> 01:48.240
Are you having a good time?

01:50.080 --> 01:53.640
You're...you're right in London.
Are you doing stuff with Mum?

01:57.160 --> 01:59.680
Fred?

01:59.720 --> 02:01.400
My friends aren't here, so...

02:01.440 --> 02:04.160
Well, couldn't they visit?

02:06.960 --> 02:09.360
Look, we're OK.

02:09.400 --> 02:11.040
I beg your pardon?

02:11.080 --> 02:12.680
You don't need to stay.

02:12.720 --> 02:14.920
I'm just enjoying my garden.

02:18.040 --> 02:20.160
Max's garden.

02:22.360 --> 02:24.000
Nine minutes.

02:25.960 --> 02:30.280
Look, you get to speak to Fred
whenever you want.

02:30.320 --> 02:32.320
I get two hours.

02:32.360 --> 02:35.160
If you want to waste your time
with your son arguing with me,

02:35.200 --> 02:36.680
shall we not do it in front of him?

02:36.720 --> 02:38.080
Fine.

02:40.480 --> 02:42.320
I'll just be back in a second.

02:42.360 --> 02:43.760
Love you.

02:44.840 --> 02:46.760
You too.

02:55.120 --> 02:57.640
What are you doing to me?
What's this about?

02:57.680 --> 02:59.920
That was about keeping my son safe.

02:59.960 --> 03:03.480
I've never hit him. Never been rude.

03:03.520 --> 03:05.840
- To him!

03:05.880 --> 03:07.760
You should count yourself lucky.

03:07.800 --> 03:10.440
Max said I could stop you
seeing Fred entirely.

03:10.480 --> 03:12.080
Yeah, but Max is a dick.

03:12.120 --> 03:15.360
You're jealous
because he's a self-made billionaire...

03:15.400 --> 03:18.960
I don't think so.
- ...and you're a grubby rumour-monger.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.120
You used to boast to your friends
about what I do.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.720
Oh, well, I will cope.

03:26.360 --> 03:28.240
You said he was out.

03:28.280 --> 03:30.040
You made me uncomfortable.

03:30.080 --> 03:31.960
Seven minutes.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.200
- Hi.

03:35.280 --> 03:39.480
Oh, well, not my politics, really,

03:39.520 --> 03:42.560
but it's very readable, and it's free.

03:42.600 --> 03:44.920
Isn't that clever?

03:44.960 --> 03:46.280
Max Klein. Hi.

03:46.320 --> 03:50.200
I'll put a photographer on you
24 hours a day.

03:50.240 --> 03:51.720
Oh, here we go.

03:51.760 --> 03:55.640
I've got people spending millions
trying to scandalise me,

03:55.680 --> 03:57.840
but it never works. Do you know why?

03:57.880 --> 03:59.320
He's clean.

03:59.360 --> 04:01.280
No drugs or alcohol.

04:01.320 --> 04:03.880
Slept around, but he's open about that.
No secrets.

04:03.920 --> 04:05.720
Unlike some people.

04:07.760 --> 04:09.920
I told him we're going to stop him
from seeing Fred.

04:09.960 --> 04:11.160
Have you?

04:11.200 --> 04:12.200
Good.

04:12.240 --> 04:13.480
You won't.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.720
Well, we'll see.

04:15.760 --> 04:19.760
Either way,
say goodbye to him properly now.

04:19.800 --> 04:21.760
Dad, what's going on?

05:48.080 --> 05:52.120
Resonance was approved by the government
at the highest level.

05:52.160 --> 05:55.720
It means if a device is connected
to the internet

05:55.760 --> 05:58.360
and has a microphone, we can listen.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.320
And if it's got a camera, we can see,

06:01.360 --> 06:02.720
so...

06:02.760 --> 06:04.920
It's all mobile phones.

06:04.960 --> 06:08.080
It's devices in your home
listening for key words -

06:08.120 --> 06:10.680
laptops or smart TVs.

06:10.720 --> 06:12.160
TVs?

06:12.200 --> 06:14.680
You can see right into my living room?

06:14.720 --> 06:17.440
And you wouldn't know.

06:17.480 --> 06:23.680
We listen to thousands of devices
at any one time for key words.

06:23.720 --> 06:28.240
So if we suspect a terrorist cell
in Birmingham, for instance,

06:28.280 --> 06:32.920
we can monitor 10, 20,000 people
in that area.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.840
And how many times has it been used?

06:34.880 --> 06:36.800
24 hours a day,

06:36.840 --> 06:38.320
different regions,

06:38.360 --> 06:39.960
for the past five months.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.480
14th August 2018.
Does that date mean anything to you?

06:43.520 --> 06:44.920
Yeah.

06:44.960 --> 06:48.200
That's when permission was given
for its wider use.

06:49.760 --> 06:50.760
Any results?

06:50.800 --> 06:53.800
Yeah, I would imagine so. I mean,
there's no doubt it's very valuable

06:53.840 --> 06:55.640
to stop a terrorist attack.

06:55.680 --> 06:57.400
Right.

06:57.440 --> 07:00.440
But, obviously, that's not the point.

07:00.480 --> 07:04.280
- And the evidence I've seen...
- It's a fraction of what I've got.

07:04.320 --> 07:05.520
I mean, details of the whole thing.

07:05.560 --> 07:10.240
E-mails that refer to the prime minister
specifically approving the project.

07:10.280 --> 07:13.400
Have you got a family, Jon?
A relationship?

07:13.440 --> 07:15.600
My parents, yeah.

07:16.680 --> 07:18.200
A boyfriend.

07:18.240 --> 07:19.800
What's your boyfriend's name?

07:19.840 --> 07:21.080
Andrew.

07:22.160 --> 07:23.360
Um...why?

07:23.400 --> 07:26.960
You're breaching the Official Secrets Act.
You could go to prison.

07:28.280 --> 07:30.680
To avoid that, you'll probably have to
leave the country.

07:30.720 --> 07:34.520
You won't see Andrew or your parents
for a very long time.

07:36.120 --> 07:38.880
You really believe this is worth it?

07:40.640 --> 07:44.160
If we allow this to carry on,
it's the end of our freedom.

07:46.120 --> 07:49.080
It's the complete end of society
as we know it.

07:53.720 --> 07:55.040
Thank you.

07:55.080 --> 07:57.960
I'm supposed to be at work tomorrow
afternoon, so if you don't run it...

07:58.000 --> 07:59.680
Of course. We'll let you know
in the morning.

07:59.720 --> 08:01.680
In the meantime,
we'll keep someone outside.

08:01.720 --> 08:03.000
They won't let anyone in this room.

08:03.040 --> 08:04.520
OK. Well, thanks.

08:04.560 --> 08:05.960
Bye.

08:07.480 --> 08:09.040
Bye.

08:09.080 --> 08:10.960
You definitely took the batteries out?

08:11.000 --> 08:14.320
Yeah. And before we started,
I unplugged everything in the room,

08:14.360 --> 08:16.760
and we're both using air-gap computers,
like you specified.

08:16.800 --> 08:20.200
Don't worry. I promise we're doing
everything that we can to protect you.

08:21.720 --> 08:23.640
Thanks.

08:27.920 --> 08:29.520
You OK?

08:32.240 --> 08:34.040
Yeah.

09:05.440 --> 09:07.000
Resonance.

09:07.040 --> 09:12.160
So, I asked every contact but, um,
none of them know anything, so...

09:12.200 --> 09:14.520
...I thought maybe we could go back
to your source?

09:14.560 --> 09:16.040
Daniel Marshall, was that him?

09:16.080 --> 09:18.080
He was so drunk he won't even remember
giving it to me,

09:18.120 --> 09:19.480
and I don't want to remind him.

09:19.520 --> 09:22.240
- Right.

09:22.280 --> 09:25.000
- Um, not yet, but I, um...

09:26.080 --> 09:28.560
Out of time. Forget about it.
I'll find someone else.

09:28.600 --> 09:30.520
- I'm doing my best.
- That's the problem.

09:30.560 --> 09:33.200
Go back to showbiz. Speak to Angie.
She'll find something for you.

09:35.680 --> 09:36.840
Go on.

09:48.160 --> 09:49.760
Duncan?

09:51.520 --> 09:54.200
There's a chunk missing.

09:54.240 --> 09:55.760
Hi.

09:55.800 --> 09:58.440
A slice of our readership has disappeared.

09:58.480 --> 10:03.040
Well, your competitor suddenly decided to
give their paper away. We take a dip -

10:03.080 --> 10:05.240
- that's market forces.
- That sounds complacent.

10:05.280 --> 10:07.360
We cost 50 pence.

10:07.400 --> 10:08.960
The Herald is now free.

10:09.000 --> 10:13.120
Do you want a graph to understand
what happens as a result?

10:14.400 --> 10:16.040
I'm not a fan of banter.

10:16.080 --> 10:18.160
Anyway, I'm not here about that.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.040
The Herald has got something.

10:23.080 --> 10:26.680
Now, I can't tell you what it is,
but it compromises national security.

10:26.720 --> 10:30.120
Now, I'm a fan of national security
but, more than that,

10:30.160 --> 10:32.040
I prefer that my paper's
getting the attention.

10:32.080 --> 10:33.320
We've got a piece coming up

10:33.360 --> 10:34.960
- about child refugees.
- No, no.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.760
On this occasion, I want you to do
more than compete.

10:37.800 --> 10:40.480
- Stop them printing it.

10:40.520 --> 10:45.120
I'm told they won't run it today
but quite possibly tomorrow.

10:45.160 --> 10:48.280
- So you haven't got long.

10:51.840 --> 10:55.200
You're always boasting about
your dark arts. Use them.

10:55.240 --> 10:58.520
One of the reporters on the team
is Holly Evans.

10:58.560 --> 11:02.160
I'm told that you and Evans have had
deep-and-meaningfuls.

11:02.200 --> 11:04.840
I don't know whether that means
tiddlywinks or sex,

11:04.880 --> 11:07.400
but, either way,
you have some kind of influence.

11:07.440 --> 11:09.040
Yes?

11:09.080 --> 11:10.440
Actually, no.

11:10.480 --> 11:13.000
I'm asking a favour,
and you're wriggling. Why?

11:13.040 --> 11:14.320
What's the story?

11:16.600 --> 11:20.160
It'll have come up in D-notice.
Raz can tell you.

11:20.200 --> 11:21.760
D-notice is confidential.

11:21.800 --> 11:23.480
Like that's ever stopped you.

11:29.880 --> 11:33.640
It involves a confidential MI5 programme
called Resonance.

11:35.600 --> 11:37.760
- Yeah.

11:37.800 --> 11:40.200
And someone at MI5 has blown the whistle.

11:41.520 --> 11:43.280
And Holly Evans is writing it?

11:45.160 --> 11:47.000
People are scared. After recent attacks,

11:47.040 --> 11:48.680
they'd be happy with the government
watching them at home

11:48.720 --> 11:49.840
if they knew that they'd be safe

11:49.880 --> 11:51.880
- on the streets.
- Well, we have to make them understand

11:51.920 --> 11:55.840
if everything you do can be utilised by
the government or any business or agency

11:55.880 --> 11:57.240
that they choose to share it with,

11:57.280 --> 11:58.760
then there's no freedom of speech,
there's no democracy.

11:58.800 --> 12:02.160
The government are only scanning it
for credible terrorist threats,

12:02.200 --> 12:04.800
- not interested in using it generally.

12:04.840 --> 12:06.320
The fact they referred it to
such a high level.

12:06.360 --> 12:07.960
What, you just want to trust them?

12:08.000 --> 12:09.680
This is what we always suspect
they're doing.

12:09.720 --> 12:12.000
- At least, with this, we know for sure.
- We can't be intimidated by politicians

12:12.040 --> 12:15.120
and the intelligence services.
It's in their interests to cover this up.

12:15.160 --> 12:19.360
The D-notice committee have issued
a "do not publish" on this.

12:19.400 --> 12:22.400
I mean, that's a serious consideration.
It's extremely rare

12:22.440 --> 12:25.840
- to ignore that.
Holly, are you with us?

12:25.880 --> 12:28.640
Legally, the D-notice
doesn't mean anything.

12:28.680 --> 12:29.720
It's part of the responsibility
of the press.

12:29.760 --> 12:32.200
We have a responsibility to let
people know the truth.

12:32.240 --> 12:33.480
If they wanted it kept secret, they should
have done it legally.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.120
- Actually, they did.

12:35.160 --> 12:37.920
- They have discretionary power.
- There should be more scrutiny.

12:37.960 --> 12:41.240
I'm telling you,
as someone who has children,

12:41.280 --> 12:44.200
I am uneasy about anything
that makes them less safe.

12:44.240 --> 12:47.280
What, anything at all

12:47.320 --> 12:49.320
James, can you say something, please?
This is your story.

12:49.360 --> 12:53.080
- You've been working on it for a month.
- I don't think we should.

12:53.120 --> 12:54.880
- Run it.

12:54.920 --> 12:58.080
What? You found him,
got him to talk to us.

12:58.120 --> 12:59.880
But now I've got the facts,
like Peter says,

12:59.920 --> 13:02.000
I'm not convinced it's justified.

13:02.040 --> 13:05.000
If the issue is oversight, then maybe
I should find a story about that.

13:05.040 --> 13:07.800
You don't have another story.
If the capability becomes public,

13:07.840 --> 13:09.680
it will render the technology useless.

13:09.720 --> 13:11.280
Well, they'll find something else.

13:11.320 --> 13:12.840
You have to trust the experts.

13:12.880 --> 13:14.800
Brooks himself said it would have made
a difference.

13:14.840 --> 13:16.400
I honestly don't know what you're saying.

13:16.440 --> 13:19.200
My 19-year-old cousin Beth
was in Eaton Place

13:19.240 --> 13:22.680
when the bomb went off, so writing this
will be very difficult for me.

13:24.280 --> 13:26.680
OK. Well, I'm sorry that this is personal

13:26.720 --> 13:28.600
but you've worked really hard on this,
James.

13:28.640 --> 13:31.400
If you believe in it, then you do it.

13:31.440 --> 13:35.840
OK. Holly, are you willing to take
this on? I know you're busy

13:35.880 --> 13:38.040
- with the Duncan Allen article.
- Yeah. No, it's fine.

13:38.080 --> 13:40.160
No problem. I'll take it on.

13:40.200 --> 13:44.320
Get the background watertight, and make
arrangements for Brooks for tomorrow.

13:44.360 --> 13:46.120
Flight, receptions at the other end.

13:46.160 --> 13:49.280
And I'll let you know in the morning
if we're on.

13:53.040 --> 13:57.040
Probably worth checking with Imogen again
to make sure legal are across this...

14:00.960 --> 14:02.440
Hello.

14:02.480 --> 14:03.880
You wanna talk?

14:05.720 --> 14:07.680
Let's talk.

14:20.200 --> 14:22.200
Thief.

14:22.240 --> 14:23.560
What?

14:23.600 --> 14:25.760
You're reporting Resonance.

14:29.320 --> 14:32.160
- I'm psychic.

14:33.400 --> 14:36.320
Actually, it's James Edwards' story.

14:36.360 --> 14:38.040
Then where did he get it from?

14:38.080 --> 14:40.720
He was approached by a source
two months ago.

14:40.760 --> 14:42.680
So, nothing to do with you, then?

14:42.720 --> 14:44.240
Actually, no.

14:44.280 --> 14:48.320
Even if it was, I thought that stealing
stories was fair game.

14:52.240 --> 14:54.560
Hmm. Walter Smith.

14:55.720 --> 14:56.800
Yeah.

14:56.840 --> 14:59.160
Give you your first job on
a national paper.

14:59.200 --> 15:02.040
Became your mentor.
You did a reading at his funeral.

15:02.080 --> 15:04.280
Are you making a point -

15:04.320 --> 15:06.680
arranging to meet here...

15:08.280 --> 15:10.560
...the journalists' church?

15:10.600 --> 15:13.360
It's the one place you can be pretty sure
there won't be any journalists.

15:30.040 --> 15:34.640
Look, I realise that things didn't
work out for you at the Post.

15:34.680 --> 15:38.160
I respect that you tried,
so I'm going to do you a favour.

15:38.200 --> 15:39.400
Don't run it.

15:39.440 --> 15:41.680
Resonance. It's a mistake.

15:41.720 --> 15:43.400
And you've made enough of those already.

15:43.440 --> 15:45.000
Why not?

15:45.040 --> 15:49.520
Trust me, there's a good reason that
that programme's in operation.

15:49.560 --> 15:53.240
- And a good reason it's confidential.

15:53.280 --> 15:55.520
You didn't know what it was
a few weeks ago.

15:57.320 --> 15:59.400
I'm not sure you know what it is now.

15:59.440 --> 16:02.320
You've been issued a D-notice warning,

16:02.360 --> 16:07.160
and I guarantee the public won't thank you
for compromising their security

16:07.200 --> 16:09.160
- at this moment.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.760
- As a colleague.

16:19.120 --> 16:21.040
How are you?

16:21.080 --> 16:22.600
Fine.

16:22.640 --> 16:24.080
Good.

16:24.120 --> 16:25.640
Yeah.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.280
Good.

16:31.800 --> 16:33.200
How's your son?

16:33.240 --> 16:36.480
You mentioned before that you were
struggling to see him.

16:36.520 --> 16:38.360
They're bringing lawyers in.

16:38.400 --> 16:40.400
They wanna stop my access.

16:42.480 --> 16:44.440
How are you sleeping?

16:44.480 --> 16:46.400
A lot of questions.

16:46.440 --> 16:48.560
Are you worried about something?

16:48.600 --> 16:51.400
Precarious position at the top,
so I've heard.

16:51.440 --> 16:52.960
Lonely.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.520
The fear that it might all just disappear
in an instant.

16:57.640 --> 16:59.920
If you make a mistake,
if you fall out of favour...

16:59.960 --> 17:03.600
Why do I feel like I'm being interviewed?

17:03.640 --> 17:06.720
Didn't you wonder why
I wanted to speak to you?

17:08.920 --> 17:10.840
You're on the record.

17:10.880 --> 17:12.240
What are you doing?

17:13.880 --> 17:15.640
You're my next story.

17:15.680 --> 17:22.040
- I gave you advice. I'm trying to help.
- Well, we're running Resonance.

17:22.080 --> 17:24.720
- She will.

17:27.200 --> 17:29.800
- Stop it.
- What you do, how you work,

17:29.840 --> 17:32.920
how your personal life contrasts
with the editorials you write.

17:32.960 --> 17:37.160
Your tax arrangements.
How you treated your ex-wife.

17:37.200 --> 17:38.880
- Write what you like.
- The new woman in your life.

17:38.920 --> 17:40.200
How much did she cost, by the way?

17:41.640 --> 17:44.920
No-one gives a shit about that.

17:44.960 --> 17:49.400
I decide what readers are interested in.
They have no idea.

17:51.360 --> 17:53.160
You said that two years ago in a talk.

17:54.760 --> 17:57.560
You decided that Danny Lyons
was interesting.

17:57.600 --> 18:00.920
Drove him to kill himself.
Well, this is my payback on his behalf.

18:00.960 --> 18:02.400
We're running it any minute now.

18:02.440 --> 18:04.920
- Yeah.

18:04.960 --> 18:06.440
Here's my comment.

18:07.600 --> 18:09.040
I dare you.

18:35.880 --> 18:38.400
Hi. This is Sarah.
Please leave a message.

18:47.720 --> 18:51.520
Just to say I'm headed home.
We're getting there with Resonance.

18:51.560 --> 18:53.480
Do you need anything?

18:53.520 --> 18:56.080
No. No, you get home.

18:56.120 --> 18:58.240
See you tomorrow.

18:58.280 --> 18:59.600
Bye.

19:29.520 --> 19:31.080
Thank you.

19:51.200 --> 19:52.760
Hi.

19:54.040 --> 19:55.880
Hi.

19:55.920 --> 19:57.320
I haven't seen you in a while.

19:57.360 --> 19:59.360
True.

19:59.400 --> 20:01.120
You got let off that Geoff Newman story?

20:01.160 --> 20:04.000
And I can't believe you stole Joshua West
from Holly.

20:04.040 --> 20:07.160
Turns out you're a bit of a shit, really,
aren't you?

20:07.200 --> 20:11.000
You know, I was doing better
before you came over.

20:11.040 --> 20:13.520
- Just having a drink.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.200
You don't look happy. What's the problem?

20:15.240 --> 20:17.000
Why are you interested?

20:17.040 --> 20:18.920
Cos I'm interested.

20:18.960 --> 20:21.040
The problem's work.

20:21.080 --> 20:22.840
Then you're very lucky.

20:22.880 --> 20:24.640
- You're not at work.

20:24.680 --> 20:26.120
Excuse me.

20:26.160 --> 20:28.440
- Yeah.

20:28.480 --> 20:30.680
Whisky and Coke, please,
and another glass of wine.

20:30.720 --> 20:32.840
I thought you said I was a shit.

20:34.400 --> 20:35.600
Yeah.

20:35.640 --> 20:37.920
Well, benefit of the doubt.

20:47.960 --> 20:49.400
Freddie's gone to bed.

20:49.440 --> 20:51.080
I need to talk to you.

20:51.120 --> 20:53.280
- No.
- Please. It's raining.

21:03.360 --> 21:05.760
Don't move till you've stopped dripping.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.160
What?

21:09.200 --> 21:12.120
Go on, I'm busy.
The gin won't drink itself.

21:13.280 --> 21:15.000
It'll probably be fine.

21:15.040 --> 21:17.560
They might print it tomorrow, this week,

21:17.600 --> 21:21.320
but there's going to be a story
in the Herald, a takedown piece.

21:21.360 --> 21:23.240
It'll describe me as a bully.

21:24.760 --> 21:26.840
How I work, what I've done.

21:28.040 --> 21:31.440
And it may talk about you...

21:31.480 --> 21:33.600
...and Krystyna.

21:38.720 --> 21:40.880
Krystyna's your whore?

21:43.480 --> 21:46.480
Once it's in print,
I'm sure it'll be picked up.

21:46.520 --> 21:48.320
TV. Internet.

21:48.360 --> 21:49.800
So I wanted to warn you.

21:49.840 --> 21:52.600
No. You don't care about me.

21:52.640 --> 21:54.560
I wanted to warn Fred.

21:54.600 --> 21:55.880
Right.

21:57.640 --> 22:00.560
Because he might get bullied
if his friends see it?

22:02.960 --> 22:04.640
Yeah.

22:04.680 --> 22:07.800
He'll defend his dad,
only to find out it was true.

22:09.040 --> 22:10.040
Yeah.

22:15.280 --> 22:18.280
So, if you could tell him
when he wakes up...

22:18.320 --> 22:20.040
No, it's fine. Fred!

22:21.600 --> 22:23.160
You said he was asleep.

22:23.200 --> 22:25.720
I said he'd gone to bed.
I doubt he's sleeping.

22:25.760 --> 22:28.640
And this is important, right?

22:28.680 --> 22:31.000
Fred, can you come down, please?

22:31.040 --> 22:33.200
Your father's got something to tell you.

22:34.800 --> 22:38.760
Now I'm free of you, I can't understand
why I stayed for so long.

22:41.840 --> 22:43.480
We were happy.

22:43.520 --> 22:45.000
At first.

22:46.320 --> 22:47.800
Then what?

22:47.840 --> 22:49.560
I got too much trouble?

22:49.600 --> 22:50.920
No.

22:50.960 --> 22:53.400
You got bored?

22:53.440 --> 22:55.080
I got shallow.

23:06.560 --> 23:08.520
Come here. Oh...

23:09.880 --> 23:12.560
Fred, sweetheart, your dad's called round
to tell you something.

23:16.160 --> 23:18.920
There's going to be a story about me.

23:18.960 --> 23:21.840
It might come out in the next few days.

23:21.880 --> 23:25.600
It'll say some pretty horrible things.

23:26.760 --> 23:29.840
Er...that I'm a bully,

23:29.880 --> 23:34.720
maybe, and that I've got a new girlfriend,

23:34.760 --> 23:37.360
and I pay her to be my girlfriend.

23:38.960 --> 23:40.720
So I wanted to let you know

23:40.760 --> 23:44.000
in case someone mentions it,
your friends or whatever.

23:45.520 --> 23:46.920
Sorry.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.920
It'll all be forgotten the next day.

23:50.960 --> 23:52.240
Is it true?

23:53.880 --> 23:55.600
It's grown-up stuff.

23:55.640 --> 23:58.160
- I don't think...
- Duncan...

23:59.640 --> 24:00.640
Yes, it's...

24:01.760 --> 24:02.960
...it's true.

24:09.160 --> 24:10.840
You all right there?

24:13.160 --> 24:14.840
I'll see you soon.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.600
This is exactly what we need,

24:20.640 --> 24:23.680
and I guarantee our lawyers are much
better than yours.

24:23.720 --> 24:26.160
Praise be you'll never see him again.

24:27.440 --> 24:30.880
I was there with a recently divorced CEO,

24:30.920 --> 24:33.600
just as his companion for the evening.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.920
He kept on forgetting my name.

24:35.960 --> 24:38.400
Duncan noticed.

24:38.440 --> 24:44.920
So we ended up at the bar talking,
and came to an arrangement.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.680
What's he like?

24:49.720 --> 24:52.440
- I'm sure you know what he's like.
- I've seen him at work,

24:52.480 --> 24:54.840
but what's he like personally,
you know, off duty?

25:01.480 --> 25:03.600
Why did you agree to meet me?

25:03.640 --> 25:06.840
Must have had something
that you wanted to say.

25:06.880 --> 25:09.160
You told me that you knew all about us.

25:09.200 --> 25:13.040
That you were going to run a story about
him and about me.

25:13.080 --> 25:14.480
Yeah.

25:14.520 --> 25:18.440
I thought you could shed some light on
the sort of man he is behind the scenes.

25:21.360 --> 25:23.760
Will you mention my name?

25:23.800 --> 25:25.200
No.

25:25.240 --> 25:27.560
But people will want to know who I am.

25:28.680 --> 25:31.600
They will be after me.
Maybe they'll take some pictures

25:31.640 --> 25:33.600
which then they will publish.

25:33.640 --> 25:35.360
Maybe.

25:35.400 --> 25:37.840
Why are you writing this?

25:37.880 --> 25:42.240
What he does in his own home
with his own money, it's up to him.

25:42.280 --> 25:43.920
Cos it's the truth.

25:43.960 --> 25:45.920
Lots of things are true.

25:45.960 --> 25:49.640
He's written editorials specifically
criticising the exact behaviour...

25:49.680 --> 25:52.960
No. You want to hurt him.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.520
I can see it now.

25:55.560 --> 25:58.720
You're not hiding it well.

25:58.760 --> 26:00.760
You hate him.

26:03.760 --> 26:05.720
Why?

26:10.280 --> 26:12.520
A 17-year-old boy called Danny Lyons

26:12.560 --> 26:16.560
killed himself because Duncan
made a front page calling him a monster.

26:19.080 --> 26:21.760
Duncan persecuted that boy into his grave.

26:42.160 --> 26:44.120
I tried to call you.

26:45.400 --> 26:49.200
When this comes out,
they will want to know everything.

26:49.240 --> 26:51.400
All my friends will know, my parents...

26:51.440 --> 26:56.080
Just...keep a low profile for a while.

26:56.120 --> 26:57.720
And don't talk to anyone.

26:58.800 --> 27:00.200
And it'll pass.

27:01.320 --> 27:02.800
I don't think so.

27:05.800 --> 27:06.840
So...

27:07.880 --> 27:09.160
...what are you going to do?

27:13.880 --> 27:15.880
I'm... I'm sorry...

27:15.920 --> 27:18.840
but I'm going to need to be able to...

27:18.880 --> 27:21.560
say that this was a mistake.

27:22.640 --> 27:23.840
And that it's over.

27:23.880 --> 27:29.160
Also, er, my son...
It's not a good time for scandal, so...

27:29.200 --> 27:31.920
So I'm sorry, but...

27:31.960 --> 27:34.080
we have to stop.

27:34.120 --> 27:36.840
- Yes.
- No, but I thought...

27:43.600 --> 27:45.240
I thought...

27:45.280 --> 27:47.920
maybe if I didn't pay you...

27:47.960 --> 27:51.680
If I could say
you were just my girlfriend,

27:51.720 --> 27:54.720
then maybe that could work.

27:54.760 --> 27:57.320
I mean, it's almost like that anyway.

27:57.360 --> 27:58.480
Right?

27:58.520 --> 28:01.720
I mean, this has moved on...

28:02.920 --> 28:04.160
...from what it was...

28:06.520 --> 28:09.920
It's... It's not about the money
any more...

28:11.080 --> 28:12.440
...really.

28:16.480 --> 28:17.400
Is it?

28:27.240 --> 28:30.040
At least I can feel good about one thing.

28:32.280 --> 28:34.320
I'm really good at my job.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.520
- Yeah, bye!
- See you later.

29:15.240 --> 29:16.960
They think I'm a traitor.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.400
What, because I'm from the Post?

29:18.440 --> 29:20.120
Er, no, we've all got mates at the Post.

29:20.160 --> 29:21.640
It's because of what you did.

29:21.680 --> 29:23.720
- Er...
- Geoff Newman, Josh West...

29:23.760 --> 29:27.080
Sorry if you didn't realise it,
but your rep, my friend, is bad.

29:27.120 --> 29:28.680
Then why are you still talking to me?

29:28.720 --> 29:30.640
I'm hoping to sleep with you,
then steal the story.

29:35.520 --> 29:40.160
I've become a deputy editor
at the new Free Herald.

29:40.200 --> 29:44.560
I'm looking for someone who knows how
to grab the attention of our readers

29:44.600 --> 29:47.400
and I don't think you're all bad.

29:47.440 --> 29:48.760
Right.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.880
So what you working on at the moment?

29:53.280 --> 29:55.480
I don't trust you that much. Not yet.
Excuse me.

30:57.560 --> 30:59.560
That was good.

30:59.600 --> 31:01.440
What?

31:01.480 --> 31:02.800
My wee. Another drink?

31:02.840 --> 31:04.760
You know, actually, I better go.

31:05.840 --> 31:06.840
What?

31:06.880 --> 31:08.440
Stuff to do.

31:08.480 --> 31:09.560
Early start.

31:10.920 --> 31:13.600
- OK.

31:13.640 --> 31:15.960
Er, thanks for the drinks. Mwah.

31:33.280 --> 31:35.240
Sorry I'm late. I had another meeting.

31:35.280 --> 31:36.640
No problem.

31:40.200 --> 31:41.520
Jon?

31:48.400 --> 31:49.880
Jon, it's Holly.

31:51.880 --> 31:53.120
Is he asleep?

31:54.240 --> 31:56.480
Where did you get that sandwich?

31:56.520 --> 31:58.920
Mm, from the shop round the corner.

31:58.960 --> 31:59.920
Who covered?

32:09.720 --> 32:12.400
Oh, shit.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.400
OK, I got it. It's cold.

32:20.440 --> 32:22.520
- See you.
- Bye.

32:24.560 --> 32:25.840
I'll see you later.

32:27.200 --> 32:28.320
No.

32:28.360 --> 32:29.800
- Jon.

32:29.840 --> 32:31.080
I'll walk with you.

32:31.120 --> 32:32.280
You were supposed to visit last night.

32:32.320 --> 32:33.560
James said you'd be there at eight o'clock

32:33.600 --> 32:34.960
- and then you didn't turn up.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.320
I was working on something else.

32:36.360 --> 32:37.760
Oh, something more important?

32:37.800 --> 32:39.360
- No, no, no, I...
- Thought this was your story.

32:39.400 --> 32:40.480
Why, what else are you doing?

32:42.800 --> 32:45.520
James called and told me he thought
it shouldn't be published.

32:45.560 --> 32:48.120
If he thinks that, everyone will.
I'll be giving up my life for no reason.

32:48.160 --> 32:49.840
That's not true.

32:49.880 --> 32:51.280
Do you know how important this is?

32:51.320 --> 32:55.080
I thought, if nobody else gives a shit
anyway, then why should I?

32:56.080 --> 32:58.160
Our team cares, Amina cares,

32:58.200 --> 32:59.920
and I am sorry I was late.

32:59.960 --> 33:02.360
But I'm absolutely serious that
in the whole time I've been at the Herald,

33:02.400 --> 33:05.000
there has never been a story
as important as this.

33:07.600 --> 33:08.960
Please, Jon.

33:32.200 --> 33:33.520
DUNCAN: It's good.

33:33.560 --> 33:35.520
- Yeah.

33:35.560 --> 33:38.960
Yeah, get a series of articles
on the background. Who she is, her family,

33:39.000 --> 33:40.440
- where they are now.
- Mate.

33:40.480 --> 33:41.480
What?

33:44.880 --> 33:46.840
Oh, the Ghost of Christmas Future.

33:51.400 --> 33:52.680
Morning.

33:52.720 --> 33:55.560
- Just about to have a confere...
- Walk with me.

33:59.360 --> 34:02.920
Get Brooks out of the country immediately.
Is he ready to go?

34:02.960 --> 34:05.040
- Yeah. He's just waiting on us.

34:05.080 --> 34:07.320
- Most of it.
- It's really good.

34:07.360 --> 34:09.680
What about the Duncan Allen Post stuff?

34:09.720 --> 34:11.240
We'll, er, link it all together,

34:11.280 --> 34:14.080
that he knew about the story
but covered it up. Leona, you're thinking

34:14.120 --> 34:16.000
- Yeah.

34:16.040 --> 34:17.680
This is not going to be easy.

34:17.720 --> 34:19.120
It's the right decision.

34:19.160 --> 34:20.480
- I agree.
- Let's get on with it.

34:20.520 --> 34:23.480
We'll do a reduced staff
at conference this morning.

34:23.520 --> 34:25.240
Keep this quiet till he's away. All right?

34:25.280 --> 34:26.920
- Sure.
- Yup.

34:26.960 --> 34:28.040
Sure.

34:30.440 --> 34:33.480
The Herald is still intending to publish.

34:33.520 --> 34:35.480
There's honestly nothing I can do.

34:35.520 --> 34:37.040
Oh.

34:37.080 --> 34:40.360
That may be the first excuse
I've ever heard you give.

34:40.400 --> 34:45.280
It's not my job to shut down stories
in other newspapers.

34:45.320 --> 34:49.240
And now principle! Fascinating!

34:49.280 --> 34:52.400
These qualities I never knew you had.

34:52.440 --> 34:54.760
So when you say
there's nothing you can do...

34:55.880 --> 34:57.320
...you mean there's nothing you wanna do.

35:00.040 --> 35:01.720
Now, I don't like the Herald.

35:01.760 --> 35:04.120
And, yes, national security is important.

35:05.320 --> 35:07.720
But, frankly, I think the story
is a disgrace.

35:07.760 --> 35:11.600
Mostly, I'm very keen
for various business reasons

35:11.640 --> 35:14.040
that our prime minister is re-elected,

35:14.080 --> 35:17.560
and agreeing to spying on his own people
isn't a good look.

35:18.680 --> 35:21.120
He's asked me to stop it,
I'm keen to oblige.

35:21.160 --> 35:23.840
But so far, you've failed.

35:23.880 --> 35:27.480
On top of that, sales are declining.

35:27.520 --> 35:30.280
- Not my fault.
- I'm thinking maybe you're in decline.

35:35.720 --> 35:37.400
God, look at this city.

35:38.960 --> 35:41.520
Isn't it something?

35:41.560 --> 35:44.920
It's a mess.

35:44.960 --> 35:47.320
Well, life's a mess.

35:51.080 --> 35:53.920
In the spirit of offering you a carrot...

35:55.040 --> 35:58.280
...as well as showing you the stick,
here's the choice.

35:58.320 --> 36:00.080
You fail to stop them printing it,

36:00.120 --> 36:03.240
and I'll conclude you're no longer
a good fit for the Post.

36:03.280 --> 36:04.320
Or...

36:05.400 --> 36:06.760
...get this done,

36:06.800 --> 36:09.760
and you'll be managing director
of the entire news division.

36:09.800 --> 36:12.800
World News Live, the Post, the Sunday,

36:12.840 --> 36:15.960
new online projects
you don't even know about.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.520
Along with that would come
a very big salary -

36:18.560 --> 36:20.560
enough to do whatever you wanted.

36:20.600 --> 36:22.720
New flat, car...

36:24.280 --> 36:26.680
...the very best divorce lawyers...

36:26.720 --> 36:28.400
You know about that.

36:28.440 --> 36:30.800
I'm friends with Max Klein's father.

36:30.840 --> 36:33.840
- Max is a prick.
- Yes, certainly.

36:33.880 --> 36:37.000
Well, even his father thinks it,
which could be useful.

36:38.360 --> 36:41.280
You want your son back from
his clutches, it makes sense.

36:42.800 --> 36:45.280
Do something about the Herald...

36:46.720 --> 36:49.400
...and this could be the start of
a beautiful new chapter.

36:49.440 --> 36:52.240
Or...do nothing...

36:52.280 --> 36:55.440
and find your things on the step.

36:57.120 --> 36:58.240
Oh!

36:58.280 --> 37:00.280
This would be your office,

37:00.320 --> 37:01.600
if you want it.

37:03.040 --> 37:05.600
The master of all you survey.

37:33.720 --> 37:35.280
Duncan.

37:35.320 --> 37:37.000
- Not now.
- Please.

37:37.040 --> 37:39.560
- Leave me alone. Seriously.
- But it's about Resonance.

37:42.080 --> 37:44.920
Yeah, we need a car to pick him up
in an hour.

37:44.960 --> 37:47.520
I'm going to send the location to you
in a separate email.

37:47.560 --> 37:51.400
Everything's set up in Ecuador.
You've spoken to Justin.

37:53.840 --> 37:56.080
Bye.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.120
You said there was something
I should know.

38:21.160 --> 38:24.200
I've been offered a promotion by Emmerson

38:24.240 --> 38:26.840
to be the editor of
the entire news division.

38:26.880 --> 38:30.600
But I'll only get it if I stop your story
on Resonance.

38:33.040 --> 38:34.960
He wants to protect the PM.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.640
Right.

38:38.560 --> 38:40.680
Sounds like the opposite of journalism
to me.

38:40.720 --> 38:43.440
And he's offered to back me with lawyers

38:43.480 --> 38:46.640
so I can fight for custody of my son.

38:46.680 --> 38:51.280
And look! You can write whatever you want
about me,

38:51.320 --> 38:55.080
but I can't fight for Freddie
without proper money.

38:55.120 --> 38:57.360
You expect me to feel sorry for you?

38:57.400 --> 38:58.920
No, not at all.

38:58.960 --> 39:02.000
I just want to explain the context
of what I'm about to do.

39:02.040 --> 39:04.720
I know where Brooks is.

39:06.040 --> 39:07.680
At the Longworth Hotel.

39:07.720 --> 39:10.280
In Marylebone. Room 503.

39:10.320 --> 39:12.800
And I'm ready to tell the police.

39:13.840 --> 39:16.360
If you agree not to run the story...

39:17.720 --> 39:20.520
...then I'll let you put him on a plane

39:20.560 --> 39:23.240
and get him out of the country,
as I assume you're about to.

39:23.280 --> 39:27.680
Otherwise, I'll make a call
and he'll be arrested in minutes

39:27.720 --> 39:32.080
under the Official Secrets Act,
and he will get a prison sentence.

39:34.720 --> 39:38.160
You're not really supposed to
use your phone in church.

39:44.880 --> 39:46.400
Are you there yet

39:47.600 --> 39:48.600
How long?

39:49.760 --> 39:51.040
Call me when you've got him.

39:53.280 --> 39:55.160
He won't be quick enough.

40:03.600 --> 40:05.400
So what do you think?

40:11.000 --> 40:14.080
Walter Smith thought you were the most
promising journalist he'd ever met.

40:15.520 --> 40:16.880
When you first started out,

40:16.920 --> 40:19.800
you wrote pieces that tore strips
off the Establishment.

40:19.840 --> 40:21.920
You were passionate, funny, and...

40:23.200 --> 40:26.240
...true. And then you built up this
reputation that you don't give a shit,

40:26.280 --> 40:27.800
but, actually, I think that really...

40:29.160 --> 40:30.880
...you're still a journalist.

40:30.920 --> 40:32.240
Walter Smith...

40:33.440 --> 40:36.880
...used to start drinking
at eleven o'clock in the morning...

40:38.720 --> 40:40.720
...and stop at dawn.

40:43.520 --> 40:46.000
Cheated on every one of his three wives.

40:46.040 --> 40:48.440
We all had to cover for him.

40:49.880 --> 40:51.480
What happens if we run it?

40:51.520 --> 40:54.000
What happens if you fail to do
what Emmerson wants?

40:54.040 --> 40:55.520
He fires me.

40:55.560 --> 40:57.040
So there's an option, isn't there?

40:58.600 --> 41:00.360
Go down in flames.

41:00.400 --> 41:03.240
Run a story that you want to run
and resign. Do something else.

41:03.280 --> 41:04.560
Your reputation will be enhanced

41:04.600 --> 41:06.680
and you can tell your son
that you did the right thing.

41:06.720 --> 41:10.360
You want to have a relationship with him,
give him summat to like.

41:12.480 --> 41:14.160
I'm gonna go now.

41:14.200 --> 41:18.120
And trust that you let Jon Brooks
get in our car and fly out the country,

41:18.160 --> 41:19.880
and leave us to run this piece.

41:21.160 --> 41:24.960
And I hope that
underneath this whole pretence

41:25.000 --> 41:28.080
you actually still believe in
our profession.

41:32.560 --> 41:35.600
You leave, he goes to prison.

41:37.400 --> 41:38.720
No.

41:40.080 --> 41:41.280
No, I don't think he will.

42:19.240 --> 42:20.760
Yeah?

42:20.800 --> 42:24.000
The Herald are here. About to head out.

42:24.040 --> 42:26.000
What do you want me to do?

42:26.040 --> 42:28.600
They're moving Brooks.

42:30.320 --> 42:32.040
What should I do?!

43:00.600 --> 43:01.680
Thanks for everything.

43:36.720 --> 43:38.440
Yes. Please.

43:43.880 --> 43:45.320
You got that photo of the refugee girl?

43:45.360 --> 43:47.680
- Mm-hm.
- We're going to lead on that,

43:47.720 --> 43:50.840
and how little this government is doing
given the scale of the crisis.

43:50.880 --> 43:52.920
That's not....

43:52.960 --> 43:55.000
Not the usual take on that, is it?

43:55.040 --> 43:58.600
Emmerson tends to want a harder line.

43:58.640 --> 44:01.560
I don't care what he wants.
That's what we're doing.

44:04.000 --> 44:05.480
No problem.

44:07.680 --> 44:09.160
Lucy!

44:12.840 --> 44:17.080
If you hear anything from Emmerson,
tell him I'm not here.

44:17.120 --> 44:18.880
If he comes down...?

44:18.920 --> 44:21.600
Warn me...and get me a cardboard box.

44:21.640 --> 44:23.560
You mean...to hide in?

44:26.960 --> 44:28.640
No.

44:28.680 --> 44:30.320
For my stuff, from my office.

44:30.360 --> 44:32.160
Your stuff

44:32.200 --> 44:33.640
I'm having a clear-out.

44:33.680 --> 44:35.200
Right.

44:40.920 --> 44:43.640
He's on the plane. Taken off.

44:43.680 --> 44:45.440
- Good.
- It's all ready to go.

44:45.480 --> 44:47.520
I haven't written the Duncan Allen story.

44:47.560 --> 44:50.560
- It didn't work out.

44:50.600 --> 44:52.040
But I thought...

44:52.080 --> 44:54.080
You don't want.... What do you mean?

44:54.120 --> 44:56.360
I focused on Resonance.

44:56.400 --> 44:59.800
Adding Duncan Allen to the mix,
that would just make it look cheap.

44:59.840 --> 45:02.200
I agree.

45:27.360 --> 45:28.920
Hi, Fred. You OK?

45:28.960 --> 45:30.360
Dad.

45:30.400 --> 45:32.640
They won't let me speak to you.

45:32.680 --> 45:34.080
You mean Mum?

45:34.120 --> 45:35.480
Max.

45:35.520 --> 45:38.720
He took my phone away
just in case you tried to call me.

45:38.760 --> 45:40.280
- He's out,

45:40.320 --> 45:41.920
and I found out where he put it.

45:41.960 --> 45:43.920
I hate him.

45:43.960 --> 45:47.000
I told Mum, but she said to shut up.

45:47.040 --> 45:48.760
Dad, I don't want her to be happy.

45:48.800 --> 45:51.320
- Fred!
- I hate it here.

45:51.360 --> 45:53.720
I hate him.

45:53.760 --> 45:57.080
It's OK, Fred. It's OK, it's all right.

45:57.120 --> 45:58.960
- But...
- Yeah, but it's not.

46:00.120 --> 46:01.520
Dad.

46:01.560 --> 46:03.680
I heard them talking about us moving...

46:03.720 --> 46:05.920
...to America.

46:05.960 --> 46:08.280
I am gonna sort it out.

46:09.720 --> 46:11.240
Just leave it to me.

46:12.440 --> 46:14.840
Trust me. Yeah?

46:16.240 --> 46:17.960
I will sort this out...

46:19.240 --> 46:21.560
...then I'll come and get you, OK?

46:23.840 --> 46:25.280
I promise.

46:26.520 --> 46:27.960
OK.

46:31.040 --> 46:32.520
Bye, Fred.

46:32.560 --> 46:33.840
Bye, Dad.

46:33.880 --> 46:35.680
Love you.

47:05.280 --> 47:07.760
Change of plan.

47:24.360 --> 47:25.360
Yeah.

47:25.400 --> 47:27.800
Hi, it's Tom Crispin from World News Live.

47:27.840 --> 47:29.520
- Yeah.

47:29.560 --> 47:32.800
Yeah, we'd like to interview you
regarding this morning's Post.

47:40.400 --> 47:41.440
Amina.

47:41.480 --> 47:42.800
Have you seen it?

47:42.840 --> 47:44.760
No. They said the Post.

47:44.800 --> 47:46.000
What's going on?

47:46.040 --> 47:49.360
We've sent a car. Pack a bag - we'll get
you here, then we'll make a plan.

47:49.400 --> 47:51.600
James is calling for you now.

47:51.640 --> 47:54.680
This is going to get worse as today goes
on, and I'd rather we get you out the way.

47:54.720 --> 47:56.400
Right. Bye.

48:05.240 --> 48:07.400
- Everyone's here looking at me.

48:19.000 --> 48:20.480
You're famous.

48:24.280 --> 48:25.400
Jesus.

48:34.560 --> 48:37.040
Hey. It'll be all right.

48:37.080 --> 48:38.880
You got a back door?

48:38.920 --> 48:41.040
The fire escape.

48:45.480 --> 48:47.160
Why did you come?

48:48.520 --> 48:49.920
They could have sent anyone.

48:49.960 --> 48:52.400
You said running it was a mistake.

48:52.440 --> 48:55.000
I thought you'd want to see
a friendly face.

48:55.040 --> 48:58.320
- You don't deserve this.
- Thanks.

49:18.400 --> 49:20.120
Mr Emmerson.

49:20.160 --> 49:21.640
- Glad you made it.
- Me too.

49:21.680 --> 49:25.000
Congratulations.
It's time to get you the best.

49:27.920 --> 49:29.440
This came for you.

49:29.480 --> 49:30.880
Mmm.

49:45.880 --> 49:47.080
What's that?

50:31.400 --> 50:32.760
Hi.

50:34.560 --> 50:37.320
When I went to pay for my cab last night,

50:37.360 --> 50:40.360
I found the cards in my purse
had been put back in a different order.

50:40.400 --> 50:43.640
I didn't think much about it,
but then, somehow,

50:43.680 --> 50:45.600
the Post found Jon Brooks,

50:45.640 --> 50:49.960
and I realised that one of those cards
was a key to his room.

50:50.000 --> 50:53.440
I left my purse...on the table, with you?

50:53.480 --> 50:54.960
In the pub?

50:55.000 --> 50:58.400
You looked through my bag!

50:58.440 --> 51:00.520
Don't deny it.

51:00.560 --> 51:01.960
OK.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.400
That's the sort of journalist
you want to be.

51:04.440 --> 51:06.800
- I get the story.
- You cheat.

51:06.840 --> 51:08.640
There aren't any roles.

51:08.680 --> 51:11.560
Not any more. Just get the story
and get it out there.

51:11.600 --> 51:12.800
You really believe that?

51:13.880 --> 51:15.160
- Yeah.
- That's a shame.

51:15.200 --> 51:18.200
Because Holly told me you originally
wanted to work at the Herald.

51:19.280 --> 51:21.200
She said your parents were Herald readers,

51:21.240 --> 51:24.320
and for a long time, you couldn't bear to
tell them where you worked.

51:24.360 --> 51:26.280
I went for a drink with you last night

51:26.320 --> 51:28.560
because I thought that maybe
you were really one of us,

51:28.600 --> 51:30.640
but had got caught up on the wrong side.

51:32.120 --> 51:33.920
At least now I know.

51:36.400 --> 51:38.840
You like the Post.

51:41.360 --> 51:43.520
You like cheating.

51:43.560 --> 51:46.440
No lines you won't cross.

51:46.480 --> 51:47.640
You're one of them.

51:48.680 --> 51:51.080
- I want to do well.
- Fine.

51:51.120 --> 51:52.800
Now I know.

51:52.840 --> 51:54.800
And everyone else will, too.

51:55.920 --> 51:58.400
Ed Washburn. Not to be trusted.

51:59.720 --> 52:01.080
Bye.

52:24.560 --> 52:26.840
Edward! Thanks for
the last couple of days.

52:26.880 --> 52:29.520
You are quite a talent.

52:29.560 --> 52:31.600
Have you met Mr Emmerson before?

52:32.720 --> 52:34.240
No.

52:34.280 --> 52:36.360
This is one of our best.

52:36.400 --> 52:40.000
Mr Emmerson is a big fan of
proper journalists.

52:40.040 --> 52:41.840
I give Edward a lot of stick,

52:41.880 --> 52:44.960
but he might just turn into the real thing
one day.

52:45.000 --> 52:46.640
I'll keep my eye out.

52:46.680 --> 52:49.320
Maybe... Maybe we could give you something
a little better.

52:49.360 --> 52:51.800
You know Better pay?

52:51.840 --> 52:54.240
Bit more choice over what you cover?

53:00.120 --> 53:01.120
Here.

53:02.440 --> 53:03.960
What?

53:04.000 --> 53:05.720
I want to stop.

53:07.520 --> 53:09.320
Quit. Now.

53:11.280 --> 53:13.440
Big mistake.

53:13.480 --> 53:15.120
Career-ending.

53:17.320 --> 53:20.080
Hand it in at the desk, not to me.

53:21.320 --> 53:23.240
Don't come back.

53:42.160 --> 53:45.160
We have to remove you from the situation.

53:45.200 --> 53:46.560
Got a better idea.

53:46.600 --> 53:50.120
- Holly, this is not about you.
- Exactly. Here.

53:52.640 --> 53:54.880
I'd do it myself...

54:45.480 --> 54:49.160
EMMERSON: He is a proven editor with bite.

54:49.200 --> 54:53.000
A hard-bitten journalist
with business acumen,

54:53.040 --> 54:56.960
and a keen sense of
what the people are after.

54:57.000 --> 55:00.360
I have no hesitation and enormous pleasure

55:00.400 --> 55:05.000
in introducing our new editor-in-chief
of the news division,

55:05.040 --> 55:06.920
Duncan Allen.

55:09.160 --> 55:11.200
My name is Holly Evans.

55:12.480 --> 55:15.880
I'm a reporter working for the Herald.

55:15.920 --> 55:19.080
I have 15 years' experience in journalism.

55:19.120 --> 55:23.440
Today, the Post,
and specifically Duncan Allen,

55:23.480 --> 55:25.720
put my photograph on the front page

55:25.760 --> 55:29.800
and called me an "enemy of the people".

55:32.880 --> 55:34.640
I want to give you some context to that.

55:34.680 --> 55:37.960
There's a piece in the Herald today
that I wrote

55:38.000 --> 55:39.880
about a man called Jon Brooks.

55:39.920 --> 55:41.200
DUNCAN: News is not comfortable.

55:42.680 --> 55:45.840
It's not always telling us stories
we want to hear.

55:45.880 --> 55:47.800
But that reflects real life.

55:47.840 --> 55:52.680
Taking on this role is a privilege,
and a responsibility.

55:52.720 --> 55:56.320
And you can see that responsibility
in today's edition.

55:56.360 --> 56:00.440
Holly Evans's story in the Herald
is a disgrace.

56:00.480 --> 56:03.600
It flies in the face
of all official advice

56:03.640 --> 56:06.240
and it makes every single person
in this country

56:06.280 --> 56:08.720
more vulnerable.

56:08.760 --> 56:12.880
Jon Brooks discovered that the government
has the power to spy on you.

56:14.280 --> 56:15.520
Right now.

56:15.560 --> 56:20.480
Through any phone, any device,
any...television.

56:22.320 --> 56:24.360
They don't ask permission,
they just do it.

56:25.640 --> 56:29.000
That means any conversation,
even in your own home,

56:29.040 --> 56:31.320
is potentially being listened to,

56:31.360 --> 56:33.800
- right now.
- Starting in this new position

56:33.840 --> 56:35.800
at Worldwide News,
I'm not going to promise you

56:35.840 --> 56:37.160
that we'll always get it right.

56:37.200 --> 56:41.040
I'm not even going to promise Mr Emmerson
that we'll make the most money.

56:41.080 --> 56:43.880
But I will promise you two things.

56:43.920 --> 56:47.360
You'll read how I've compromised
the fight against terrorism,

56:47.400 --> 56:51.520
but if we don't have freedom of speech,
freedom of thought, and privacy

56:51.560 --> 56:54.840
when we need it, then the fight
for our society is already over.

56:54.880 --> 56:56.080
The terrorists have won.

56:56.120 --> 56:58.600
It will be entertaining.

56:58.640 --> 57:02.120
HOLLY: I just ask that before you jump to
a conclusion, a judgment,

57:02.160 --> 57:03.680
that you read the facts.

57:03.720 --> 57:07.200
Jon Brooks has given up his entire life
for this.

57:07.240 --> 57:10.320
- And it will be true.
- And leading from his example,

57:10.360 --> 57:12.680
I'm not sorry about this story.

57:12.720 --> 57:15.040
I'm actually far more determined.

57:15.080 --> 57:16.800
So we'll just keep doing what we do.

57:18.240 --> 57:19.680
I won't give up.

57:26.240 --> 57:27.480
That all right?

57:28.720 --> 57:30.320
It's perfect.

57:50.600 --> 57:53.240
My name is Holly Evans.
