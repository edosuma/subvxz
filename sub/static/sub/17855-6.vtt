00:11.812 --> 00:13.414
- Are skinny jeans
still a thing?

00:13.447 --> 00:15.283
- All right, before we even
talk about jeans,

00:15.316 --> 00:16.750
we need to talk about
cat sweaters.

00:16.784 --> 00:18.352
- Uh-huh?

00:18.386 --> 00:21.322
- No.

00:21.355 --> 00:22.523
- Oh.

00:22.556 --> 00:24.658
- Christmas has come early.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.660
We have the best show
tonight.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.662
Jason Biggs is back with us.

00:28.696 --> 00:32.466
And Jason, as you know, is
kind of a homegrown talent here.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.568
He popped his late-night
talk show cherry

00:34.602 --> 00:36.237
right here on our show.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.805
So it's really exciting
he's coming back.

00:37.838 --> 00:39.407
- He's so hot.

00:39.440 --> 00:40.741
- Honey, back when
I was with men,

00:40.774 --> 00:43.611
Jason Biggs was
totally my type.

00:43.644 --> 00:45.646
My wife agrees,
we'd make a cute couple.

00:45.679 --> 00:47.315
- Okay, let's keep it
in your thong.

00:47.348 --> 00:49.450
Anyway, Jason Biggs
couldn't be nicer.

00:49.483 --> 00:52.653
He is, by all means,
the sweetest guy in Hollywood.

00:52.686 --> 00:55.156
We also have Beth Stern
and her kittens

00:55.189 --> 00:56.857
and comedienne,
Keisha Zollar.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.492
Beth's doing some incredible
work with

00:58.526 --> 01:00.461
the North Shore Animal League

01:00.494 --> 01:02.730
and she brought some kittens
for adoption.

01:02.763 --> 01:04.698
- Baba Booey!

01:04.732 --> 01:07.135
- Okay, we're not gonna do that,
and I'm gonna tell you why.

01:07.168 --> 01:09.637
Because she is not here as
Howard Stern's wife,

01:09.670 --> 01:13.441
she is here as an animal rescuer
and crusader.

01:13.474 --> 01:17.178
- Fafa Phooey.
- Okay, now I'm serious.

01:17.211 --> 01:18.712
- Hey now!
- Okay, stop it.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.781
Enough.
Enough, enough, enough!

01:20.814 --> 01:23.884
- You know, back when I was with
men, Howard was totally my type.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.487
I mean, my wife agrees that
we'd make a cute couple.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.122
- You know, for a guy
with a wife,

01:28.156 --> 01:31.759
you sure do talk about
making love to men a lot.

Tonight professional
pie-hopper, Jason Biggs.

01:42.936 --> 01:47.175
The world's hottest cat-lover,
Beth Stern.

01:47.208 --> 01:48.309
She's not a fortune teller.

01:48.342 --> 01:51.279
She's comedienne Keisha Zollar.

01:51.312 --> 01:53.881
And now, the man who's
number five in the ratings

01:53.914 --> 01:56.217
but number one in our hearts.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.619
Here's Jimmy.

02:02.823 --> 02:04.792
- Mr. Biggs, welcome
to "Nightcap."

02:04.825 --> 02:07.261
We're so excited to have you
on the show today.

02:07.295 --> 02:08.662
- Well, I'm happy
to be here.

02:08.696 --> 02:10.431
I've always wanted to
come on "Nightcap."

02:10.464 --> 02:13.434
- Oh, wait, you've been
on the show before.

02:13.467 --> 02:14.802
- Have I?
- Have you?

02:14.835 --> 02:16.270
- Have I?

02:16.304 --> 02:17.371
- You have?
- I can't recall.

02:17.405 --> 02:19.173
I mean, I may have,

02:19.207 --> 02:23.311
but there's no photo of me
commemorating that, so...

02:23.344 --> 02:25.346
- Oh, wait, no. Isn't there
that great photo of you

02:25.379 --> 02:26.880
in the lobby with all
the other past guests?

02:26.914 --> 02:29.550
Like, I've definitely
seen that before.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.685
- Yeah, me too.
I have seen it before.

02:31.719 --> 02:34.288
But not today,
because today when I came in

02:34.322 --> 02:37.958
this photo was hanging where
my photo used to hang.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.594
- Oh, I love
Jon Bon Jovi.

02:40.628 --> 02:43.264
- Yeah, obviously you love him
more than you love me.

02:43.297 --> 02:45.966
- Oh, my God. No.
I love you both equally.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.536
- Listen, that photo of me
better be back

02:48.569 --> 02:50.371
hanging up
by the end of the day

02:50.404 --> 02:53.641
or Jason Biggs is
gonna come down hard

02:53.674 --> 02:54.842

Whoo!

03:20.834 --> 03:22.536
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:22.570 --> 03:23.671
- What are you doing?

03:23.704 --> 03:25.506
- I'm bagging.

03:25.539 --> 03:28.809
- I can see that.
What are you doing in here?

03:28.842 --> 03:30.378
- Oh, I'm speed bagging.

03:30.411 --> 03:31.679
- Todd, what room
is this?

03:31.712 --> 03:33.481
- It's the greenroom, but...
- Yeah.

03:33.514 --> 03:34.715
- It's white and blue.
- Mm-hmm.

03:34.748 --> 03:35.883
And what happens
in the greenroom?

03:35.916 --> 03:38.719
- The guests eat candy.

03:38.752 --> 03:41.589
- Why would I want
a punching bag

03:41.622 --> 03:44.425
in the middle of
the greenroom space?

03:44.458 --> 03:45.759
- I got an answer for you.

03:45.793 --> 03:48.462
Yeah, this was upstairs
and Jimmy was like,

03:48.496 --> 03:50.431
"It's really annoying,
so bring it downstairs."

03:50.464 --> 03:52.733
So Jimmy told me to
bring it downstairs.

03:52.766 --> 03:54.268
- Okay, look, I get it.
- Uh-huh.

03:54.302 --> 03:55.769
- I get that you didn't
get into college

03:55.803 --> 03:57.405
so you couldn't get into
a fraternity

03:57.438 --> 03:59.473
where you date blow-up dolls
and you hit balls,

03:59.507 --> 04:00.608
- Yeah, I still did all that.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.376
- I get it.
- Uh-huh.

04:02.410 --> 04:04.678
- But you are not taking over
my professional space.

04:04.712 --> 04:06.447
- Okay, yeah.
No, I'm sorry.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.616
Yeah, I'll--I'll--I'll
get this outta here.

04:08.649 --> 04:10.451
But it does feel good.
You wanna give it a punch?

04:10.484 --> 04:12.052
- I don't need to give it
a punch. I play tennis.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.987
- Oh, no. You need to
give this a punch.

04:14.021 --> 04:17.958
No, you're not hitting balls
here, you're hitting a bag.

04:17.991 --> 04:20.694
Everyone says you're
all tightly wound.

04:20.728 --> 04:22.630
- I'm not tightly wound.

04:22.663 --> 04:23.964
- You're tightly wound
right now.

04:23.997 --> 04:25.799
- I am not tightly wound.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.601
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

04:27.635 --> 04:29.470
- Everyone says you are.
- Who's everyone?

04:29.503 --> 04:32.005
- Everybody I've ever met,
old people, young people.

04:32.039 --> 04:34.708
Even a baby one time was like,
"She's tightly wound."

04:34.742 --> 04:37.077
- God forbid I'm in my 40s
and not married

04:37.110 --> 04:39.647
and I don't have children, so
oh, my God, I gotta be uptight.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.482
- I thought you were 58.

04:41.515 --> 04:43.517
- Because I'm in control of
this world of broken toys

04:43.551 --> 04:45.018
and I'm the captain
of this ship.

04:45.052 --> 04:47.054
I'm the captain
of "Nightcap," right?

04:47.087 --> 04:48.656
- Yeah.
- And because I'm a woman

04:48.689 --> 04:50.691
I have to be uptight or a bitch!
- [grunts]

04:50.724 --> 04:52.560
- Now, I know how
Hillary Clinton feels.

04:52.593 --> 04:53.727
- Yeah, take it out, now!

04:53.761 --> 04:55.095
- I--no, no.
- Take it out!

04:55.128 --> 04:56.664
- No! No!
- It feels good.

04:56.697 --> 04:57.765
Take it out.

04:57.798 --> 04:58.832
- [groans]

04:58.866 --> 05:00.601
- Come on, trust me.

05:00.634 --> 05:01.669
Ahh, right?

05:01.702 --> 05:02.770
- All right.

05:02.803 --> 05:03.837
- Ooh.

05:03.871 --> 05:04.938
- Okay.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.007
- Yeah.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.576
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:08.609 --> 05:09.977

05:12.780 --> 05:15.015
[lively trumpet music]

05:15.048 --> 05:16.684
- So we're at the end
of the trip.

05:16.717 --> 05:18.786
We get to Capri and I'm like,
I'm done with him.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.821
I'm done with her.
- Totally.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.390
I just need time
to date me, you know?

05:22.423 --> 05:24.392
- [laughs]
You're so funny.

05:24.425 --> 05:25.793
- Hi, Mrs. Stern.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.027
- Hi.

05:27.060 --> 05:28.362
- I'm Penny from
the talent department.

05:28.396 --> 05:29.797
I'm Staci's assistant.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.965
- Hi, Penny. Great sweater.
It's amazing.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.501
- Oh, my God!
Do you want it?

05:33.534 --> 05:34.668
- Oh, no, no, no, that's okay.
- Okay.

05:34.702 --> 05:36.470
Thank you so much
for having me on

05:36.504 --> 05:38.071
to promote
North Shore Animal League.

05:38.105 --> 05:40.541
Really, it means so much
to me to be here.

05:40.574 --> 05:43.777
- Are you kidding?
We are so excited to have you

05:43.811 --> 05:45.479
and your kittens.
- Thank you.

05:45.513 --> 05:47.948
- I was wondering, could
I possibly meet your kittens.

05:47.981 --> 05:49.750
I mean, if they're here already.
Are they?

05:49.783 --> 05:51.719
- They're in my dressing room.
Go play with them.

05:51.752 --> 05:52.886
You're gonna die,
they're so cute.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.922
- Oh, my God!
Thank you.

05:54.955 --> 05:56.657
- Is she okay?

05:56.690 --> 05:57.925
- Oh, she cries a lot.

05:57.958 --> 06:00.127
Happy tears, sad tears,
just a lot of tears.

- Hello. I'm here to
see Jason Biggs.

06:10.871 --> 06:13.140
- What's your business
with Mr. Biggs?

06:13.173 --> 06:16.744
- I'm here to--to pre-interview
him for the show tonight.

06:16.777 --> 06:18.579
- He didn't say anything
about an interview.

06:18.612 --> 06:20.648
- Well, that's why
he's here.

06:20.681 --> 06:22.950
- Hmm. No, you're not
on the list.

06:22.983 --> 06:24.552
- What list?

06:24.585 --> 06:25.953
- You'd know if you were
on it, wouldn't you?

06:25.986 --> 06:27.721
- How about you just
pop your head in there

06:27.755 --> 06:30.691
and tell him
that I'm here?

06:32.993 --> 06:36.063
- J, yeah, some lady.
All right.

06:38.165 --> 06:39.667
Mr. Biggs will
see you now, ma'am.

06:39.700 --> 06:44.004
- Okay.

06:44.037 --> 06:45.172
- That's a good one
of me.

06:45.205 --> 06:46.874
Ooh, I look
really good there.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.476
Keep it. Mark that one.
Mark that one.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.043
- Oh, gosh, hi.
Hi, everybody.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.211
Hey! Welcome back.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.013
Staci Cole.

06:53.046 --> 06:55.082
I--

06:55.115 --> 06:58.519
I produced your first
late-night talk show segment.

06:58.552 --> 06:59.653
- No, you didn't.
- Yes.

06:59.687 --> 07:00.921
Remember,
I sent you a bike.

07:00.954 --> 07:02.490
- I don't ride bikes.

07:02.523 --> 07:03.857
- You were nervous and...
- No, I wasn't.

07:03.891 --> 07:05.659
- You were young.
- Probably not.

07:05.693 --> 07:07.094
- Okay.
- What would you like?

07:07.127 --> 07:08.962
- Oh, I'm doing
the pre-interview.

07:08.996 --> 07:10.631
- You guys hear this?

07:10.664 --> 07:11.965
- I don't understand.
- I'm sorry.

07:11.999 --> 07:13.601
Why am I pre-interviewing?

07:13.634 --> 07:15.202
No one makes me
pre-interview.

07:15.235 --> 07:16.804
Letterman never made me
pre-interview.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.506
Seth doesn't make me
pre-interview.

07:18.539 --> 07:21.008
Carson, when he was around,
God rest his soul,

07:21.041 --> 07:22.610
didn't make me pre-interview.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.745
But--but please,
enlighten me.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.547
- Actually, Jimmy
and the writers thought

07:26.580 --> 07:29.149
it would be really funny
to do a sketch with you.

07:29.182 --> 07:31.118
- Hmm, cool.
Cool, let's hear it.

07:31.151 --> 07:32.920
Let's--let's hear the genius
that keeps you guys

07:32.953 --> 07:35.789
locked in a solid fifth place in
the ratings every week.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.658
both: [chuckle]

07:37.691 --> 07:40.561
- They were thinking maybe
because you're sort of

07:40.594 --> 07:42.229
famously this really nice guy...
- True.

07:42.262 --> 07:43.664
- That you would play
an asshole.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.599
- No.

07:45.633 --> 07:46.934
- No?

07:46.967 --> 07:48.736
- No. No, that's hacky.
- All right.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.604
- Yeah, and I am a nice guy,

07:50.638 --> 07:52.272
so it's stupid and it doesn't
work at all.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.607
- Okay, that's fine.

07:53.641 --> 07:55.042
Let's not do that.
- Yeah.

07:55.075 --> 07:57.110
- Why don't you go out...
- Yeah.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.712
- And just bring some of that
Biggs magic.

07:58.746 --> 08:00.681
- I have an idea.
- Yeah.

08:00.714 --> 08:03.216
- Why don't I just go out and
bring some of my Biggs magic.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.918
- Great. So we can do that.
- Yeah.

08:04.952 --> 08:06.119
- So I'll--

08:06.153 --> 08:07.621
- So are we good here,
hon?

08:07.655 --> 08:10.023
- Yes.
So just, um...

08:10.057 --> 08:12.092
Oh, my--
Oh, my God!

08:12.125 --> 08:13.927
- Oh, my God.
- What are you doing?

08:13.961 --> 08:16.229
- What happened there?
- I don't understand that.

08:16.263 --> 08:18.065
Did you see what he did?
- Excuse me, what I did?

08:18.098 --> 08:20.067
- He poured a bottle of beer
on my...

08:20.100 --> 08:22.035
- Excuse me. I'm sorry.
- Knock-off Chanel shoes.

08:22.069 --> 08:24.572
- Excuse me.
Did you guys see? Did I?

08:24.605 --> 08:25.973
- What did I--did I--
- No.

08:26.006 --> 08:29.076
I just checked,
and I didn't do anything, so...

08:29.109 --> 08:31.211
- One more thing.
This room is a shithole.

08:31.244 --> 08:33.246
- This is a deluxe room.
- And I need--sorry.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.616
And I need a place
for my peeps to sit.

08:35.649 --> 08:38.652
- Oh, okay.
- So we need some pillows.

08:38.686 --> 08:40.754
- Like loose pillows?

08:40.788 --> 08:43.056
- Loose? Why are you--loose?
I don't care if they're loose.

08:43.090 --> 08:44.825
Why'd you say--
why'd you say loose?

08:44.858 --> 08:46.293
- I don't know if we have any.
- You sound like a fool.

08:46.326 --> 08:48.061
You think I deal with this
at Fallon or Seth?

08:48.095 --> 08:50.030
You think Seth makes me deal
with this shit?

08:50.063 --> 08:53.667
Why--hold up. Why am I--What,
am I producing my own segment?

08:53.701 --> 08:55.268
- It seems like you're--
- That's not my job.

08:55.302 --> 08:57.204
I think I would fucking kill
myself if that's my job.

08:57.237 --> 08:58.906
- Okay.
- Okay?

08:58.939 --> 09:00.340
- Yes, I will go see...
- So let's hop to it.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.009
- If I can find
some loose pillows.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.944
- They don't have--
Why are you saying loose?

09:03.977 --> 09:05.012
Why do you keep saying loose?
- I don't understand.

09:05.045 --> 09:08.616
It's--I'm sorry.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.884
Um, excuse me.

09:24.798 --> 09:27.668
- Whoa!
My favorite gray kitten.

09:27.701 --> 09:29.870
Come back,
little rain cloud.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.104
Uh-oh.

09:33.106 --> 09:37.277
I should let Beth know that
her container is not working.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.212
Quick head count.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.615
One, two, three,

09:41.649 --> 09:45.018
four, five, six.

09:45.052 --> 09:47.154
Oh, shoot.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.792
Phil!

09:51.825 --> 09:53.727
- I was doing
normal things.

09:53.761 --> 09:56.396
- Okay, fine.
Phil, come here.

09:56.429 --> 09:57.798
- Uh...

09:57.831 --> 09:58.966
- Phil!

09:58.999 --> 10:01.268
I need your help.

10:01.301 --> 10:04.004
- Of all the corners I
could have been hiding in.

10:04.037 --> 10:08.776
- Hurry.

10:08.809 --> 10:10.343
We're having
an emergency.

10:10.377 --> 10:13.180
- Oh, man, I don't have
a gun or anything.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.849
- Okay, Phil, you don't
need a gun for this.

10:15.883 --> 10:18.318
We're missing a kitten
and I need your help.

10:18.351 --> 10:20.854
- Well, I don't have any
training to do that.

10:20.888 --> 10:23.791
- Okay, Phil,
there were seven,

10:23.824 --> 10:26.960
and now there are
only six kittens, so...

10:26.994 --> 10:29.863
- It sounds like
one went missing.

10:29.897 --> 10:31.031
- Exactly.

10:31.064 --> 10:32.165
This is really bad.

10:32.199 --> 10:33.166
You can't tell anyone.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.968
I could lose my job
over this.

10:35.002 --> 10:36.369
- I'm gonna check all
the dressing rooms.

10:36.403 --> 10:39.707
You check the greenroom.
Shh, don't tell anyone.

10:39.740 --> 10:43.977
[lively trumpet music]

10:44.011 --> 10:48.348
- [clicking tongue]
Here, kitty.

10:48.381 --> 10:49.249
- What are you doing
with your mouth?

10:49.282 --> 10:52.019
- Oh, hi. Hi. Nothing.

10:52.052 --> 10:56.456
I'm just walking around
enjoying the office and my job.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.191
- What about
Jason Biggs, huh?

10:58.225 --> 11:01.061
- Yeah.
- He was such a nice guy.

11:01.094 --> 11:02.395
You know,
I think that's what happens

11:02.429 --> 11:03.764
when fame goes to your head.
- Yes.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.733
- I mean, this is
Jason Biggs now.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.868
- Yeah, fame,
it's a bitch.

11:07.901 --> 11:10.938
[meowing]

11:10.971 --> 11:12.740
- What's wrong
with you?

11:12.773 --> 11:14.474
I'm sorry, what's wrong
with you right now?

11:14.507 --> 11:17.377
- Oh, nothing.
I'm just--I'm great.

11:17.410 --> 11:19.212
Everything's great.

11:19.246 --> 11:20.814
- Okay.

11:20.848 --> 11:23.350
- Staci, I can't lie
to you.

11:23.383 --> 11:25.986
That's not the foundation
of our relationship.

11:26.019 --> 11:28.922
I lost one of
Beth Stern's kittens.

11:28.956 --> 11:30.157
- Oh, my God,
what happened?

11:30.190 --> 11:31.458
- I don't know.

11:31.491 --> 11:33.794
I--but I'm on it.
I will not let you down.

11:33.827 --> 11:36.730
I will find that kitten
or I will slit my wrists.

11:36.764 --> 11:38.465
- Okay, let's
dial it down, okay?

11:38.498 --> 11:40.033
Let's not slice
anything.

11:40.067 --> 11:42.002
Just find
Beth's kitten.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.971
- I will.

11:52.145 --> 11:55.248
Yeah! Whoa!
Jesus.

11:55.282 --> 11:58.118
- Oh man, Staci, get a load of
Biggs, man. This guy rocks.

11:58.151 --> 12:00.353
- Sandy, where have you
been hiding Todd?

12:00.387 --> 12:01.989
He is the only good part
of this show.

12:02.022 --> 12:03.523
- Yeah, Todd is awesome,

12:03.556 --> 12:05.358
but, Jason, your segment's
coming up so...

12:05.392 --> 12:07.194
- What?
- Your segment's coming up.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.162
- No, I heard you.
No, I'm not ready.

12:09.196 --> 12:10.430
I'm gonna need, like,
at least a half hour

12:10.463 --> 12:12.332
or 30 minutes.

12:12.365 --> 12:14.935
Look, I still have to
pick out which outfit

12:14.968 --> 12:16.169
I'm gonna wear tonight.

12:16.203 --> 12:18.405
Sorry, what is your problem?
[grunts]

12:18.438 --> 12:20.373
- Well, my problem is
it's a live show, so we--

12:20.407 --> 12:23.510
Keisha, why don't I go do your
pre-interview with you now?

12:23.543 --> 12:25.545
- I thought we weren't doing
pre-interviews.

12:25.578 --> 12:28.849
- No, we do pre-interviews, and
Jimmy doesn't know who you are

12:28.882 --> 12:30.784
so I have to prep him.

12:30.818 --> 12:32.319
- Jason said I don't have to
do a pre-interviews.

12:32.352 --> 12:33.520
- What?
- Mnh-mnh.

12:33.553 --> 12:35.288
together: No pre-interviews.
- Boom!

12:35.322 --> 12:37.157
- Hey, Stace, can you grab me
a peach daiquiri

12:37.190 --> 12:38.859
from the guest bar?

12:38.892 --> 12:40.027
- Are you serious?

12:40.060 --> 12:42.329
- Time-out.
Flag on the plizay.

12:42.362 --> 12:43.496
There's a guest bar?

12:43.530 --> 12:45.065
- No, there's not.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.566
- WTF, get me involved.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.401
Peach daiquiris
all around.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.237
[cheering]

12:50.270 --> 12:52.239
All right!
Huh!

12:52.272 --> 12:54.207
Hey, Todd, why don't you show us
all how it's done.

12:54.241 --> 12:56.509
- Yo, watch this, y'all.

12:56.543 --> 12:59.112
- What?
He ain't even looking.

12:59.146 --> 13:00.580
You should look.
- I should look now.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.182
- You should look.
- I should look now, okay.

13:03.583 --> 13:07.254
[lively trumpet music]

13:07.287 --> 13:09.289
- Sometimes I don't know if
I should listen to Howard 100

13:09.322 --> 13:11.258
or if I should listen
to Howard 101.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.560
And then there's that weird time
where there's a commercial

13:13.593 --> 13:15.028
on both,
and then I'm like,

13:15.062 --> 13:17.197
I have no idea what to
do with my life.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.466
Oh, my God, look at us.
We're like two yentas.

13:19.499 --> 13:22.002
Again, I'm Randy
from sound.

13:22.035 --> 13:23.837
I'm gonna have to
mic you.

13:23.871 --> 13:25.973
If you just would take your
dress off, that would be a help.

13:26.006 --> 13:27.474
- Oh, you know what,
I can mic myself.

13:27.507 --> 13:28.909
I've done this before.
We're good.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.010
We're good.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.344
- Oh, okay.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.246
Actually, I am
adopting a cat

13:33.280 --> 13:34.915
from the
North Shore Animal League

13:34.948 --> 13:37.217
so that Howard and I
can be bonded forever.

13:37.250 --> 13:39.552
And I know that you
work with them,

13:39.586 --> 13:42.255
and I would love a letter of
recommendation from you

13:42.289 --> 13:43.523
or just sort of
a good word.

13:43.556 --> 13:45.092
- That's not necessary.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.027
- Do you know about
bonding principles?

13:47.060 --> 13:49.029
That's where you get 'em
while they're real young

13:49.062 --> 13:52.199
and you strap 'em to
your chest shirtless

13:52.232 --> 13:53.633
to replicate the womb.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.368
It's really great
for them.

13:55.402 --> 13:57.037
- Isn't that more like
a baby thing?

13:57.070 --> 13:58.906
- Oh, cats and babies
are the same.

13:58.939 --> 14:00.273
[static crackles]
- Randy, we need you onstage.

14:00.307 --> 14:03.043
- Oh, that's me.
People need me.

14:03.076 --> 14:06.179
You were great. Baba Booey.

14:06.213 --> 14:07.514
[laughs]

14:07.547 --> 14:09.950
- Thanks.
That guy is weird.

14:09.983 --> 14:11.451
- Tell me about it.

14:11.484 --> 14:13.486
- You know, I have to admit,
back when I was with men,

14:13.520 --> 14:15.188
Randy was totally my type.

14:15.222 --> 14:16.423
- He was?

14:16.456 --> 14:18.091
- JK.

14:18.125 --> 14:19.426
[laughter]

14:19.459 --> 14:20.961
He's gross.

14:20.994 --> 14:23.496
- Oh, so gross.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.365
- Who's your favorite
character in "Rocky"?

14:25.398 --> 14:27.167
- Oh, man.
I'd go Ivan Drago.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.036
- I like Rocky.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.370
- You like Rocky?
- Yeah.

14:30.403 --> 14:32.305
- You can't pick Rocky.
- Why?

14:32.339 --> 14:34.207
- No, if you're gonna do--
Obviously, there's Rocky,

14:34.241 --> 14:35.375
but you gotta pick
a different character--

14:35.408 --> 14:36.944
- Hey, guys, what up?

14:36.977 --> 14:38.478
It's not a party
without melon, right?

14:38.511 --> 14:41.281
- Let me see.

14:41.314 --> 14:42.649
Cantaloupe.
- Yeah.

14:42.682 --> 14:45.185
- Cool, man.

dropped something.

ever marry you.

- Ow!

[laughter]

14:57.664 --> 14:59.132

any sense.

do my job.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.704

for loose pillows!

[lively trumpet music]

15:14.047 --> 15:16.016
Who is that?

15:16.049 --> 15:17.384
- The lost kitten.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.252
- No, it's not, Phil.

15:19.286 --> 15:21.288
That's a cat.
That's a full-grown cat.

15:21.321 --> 15:22.555
That's not a kitten.

15:22.589 --> 15:23.723
It's a cat.

15:23.756 --> 15:26.059
- Says you.

15:26.093 --> 15:28.028
- [knock on door]
- Mrs. Stern.

15:28.061 --> 15:30.063
Oh. Hey, have you guys
seen Beth Stern?

15:30.097 --> 15:31.999
'Cause we were in the middle of
this amazing conversation

15:32.032 --> 15:33.633
about Howard's
baby wipes,

15:33.666 --> 15:36.536
and I didn't get the brand
name, and I'm just--

15:36.569 --> 15:38.671
- Beth Stern isn't here,
but guess what.

15:38.705 --> 15:40.507
- What?
- I solved a problem.

15:40.540 --> 15:43.676
This is Beth's lost kitten.

15:43.710 --> 15:46.546
- Hello.
How are the kittens?

15:46.579 --> 15:50.017
- Hey, great news.
I found your missing kitten.

15:50.050 --> 15:51.751
- I'm not missing
a kitten.

15:51.784 --> 15:54.287
I brought six kittens.

15:54.321 --> 15:56.256
That's a cat.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.158
- I had nothing
to do with this.

15:58.191 --> 16:01.328
- Oh, my God. You only
brought six kittens?

16:01.361 --> 16:03.363
Oh, thank God!

16:03.396 --> 16:05.432
We thought that
we had lost one,

16:05.465 --> 16:07.100
and so we were trying
to replace it.

16:07.134 --> 16:09.569
- Oh, don't tell her
the plan.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.638
- Wait a second,
who is that mama cat?

16:11.671 --> 16:14.474
- I found her across the street
at the apartment building.

16:14.507 --> 16:16.776
Some kids were playing with her.
Her name's Lucy.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.079
- Wait, you took Lucy
away from children?

16:19.112 --> 16:20.480
- Well, I told them
it was in the name of

16:20.513 --> 16:22.249
official police business

16:22.282 --> 16:25.052
and that Lucy was
being sacrificed

16:25.085 --> 16:26.219
for the greater good.

16:26.253 --> 16:28.021
- And they were
okay with that?

16:28.055 --> 16:30.057
- No, they were
very, very disappointed

16:30.090 --> 16:31.591
and very sad.

16:31.624 --> 16:33.426
- Who are you people?

16:33.460 --> 16:36.196
- Oh, my God, did we not
introduce ourselves?

16:36.229 --> 16:38.665
I'm Penny.
I'm Staci's assistant.

16:38.698 --> 16:39.699
- Again, I'm Randy.

16:39.732 --> 16:41.468
- You know what?

16:41.501 --> 16:44.271
I feel like this is gonna be
some sort of a thing,

16:44.304 --> 16:47.374
so I'm gonna not tell you
my name.

16:47.407 --> 16:50.310
[lively trumpet music]

16:50.343 --> 16:52.179
- Oh, thank you for coming.
- Thank you so much.

16:52.212 --> 16:53.580
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Thank you.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.082
Great job.
- Have a great night. Thank you.

16:55.115 --> 16:56.716
Thank you for
all that you do.

16:56.749 --> 16:57.784
Thank you. Thank you.
- You're wonderful. Thank you.

16:57.817 --> 16:59.319
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.154
Oh, Jason,
thank you so much.

17:01.188 --> 17:03.256
And I'm so sorry about
the photo debacle in the lobby.

17:03.290 --> 17:05.158
- Yes, I will have it up
ASAP, I promise.

17:05.192 --> 17:09.829
- Please, you guys, stop it.
You guys are too sweet.

17:09.862 --> 17:12.265
Seriously, no worries
at all about it.

17:12.299 --> 17:13.700
- Okay.
- Don't even stress about it.

17:13.733 --> 17:16.403
You guys are
really fantastic.

17:16.436 --> 17:19.139
I hope it's okay, but I had
another picture taken of me

17:19.172 --> 17:21.408
and I took the liberty
of putting it up

17:21.441 --> 17:23.310
on the greenroom wall.
I hope that's okay.

17:23.343 --> 17:25.078
- Oh. Oh!
Thank you so much.

17:25.112 --> 17:26.779
I don't know what to say.
Thank you.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.715
- Oh, God, okay. I didn't want
to, like, overstep my bounds

17:28.748 --> 17:30.183
or anything.
You guys are awesome.

17:30.217 --> 17:33.486
This was truly
such a good time.

17:33.520 --> 17:36.689
- Great. So thank you
so much for coming on.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.825
- Well, will you
have me back?

17:38.858 --> 17:40.627
I hope.
- Yes, it would be our honor.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.495
- Our extreme privilege.
- Fantastic.

17:42.529 --> 17:43.796
Well, love to you all,
okay.

17:43.830 --> 17:45.232
- Love to you.

17:45.265 --> 17:46.666
- Bye you guys.
Thank you so much.

17:46.699 --> 17:47.800
- Okay.
- Bye.

17:47.834 --> 17:48.801
- Bye.
- Love you.

17:48.835 --> 17:52.672
- Don't say love you.

17:56.176 --> 17:58.378

17:59.512 --> 18:02.115

graffiti artist.
