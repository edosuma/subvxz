Elbow up as you draw.

01:34.619 --> 01:36.119
Yuhu Senna!

03:27.498 --> 03:28.497
No!

04:18.647 --> 04:21.783
Jonas, care to tell your brother
and sister the good news?

04:21.817 --> 04:22.851
What happened,
did you get shot again?

04:22.886 --> 04:24.152
Did you give up piano?

04:24.187 --> 04:25.587
- No.
- That'd be good for my ears.

04:25.622 --> 04:28.023
Jeannie. But you'll be
rid of me soon enough.

04:28.058 --> 04:29.824
I made my decision.
Oh.

04:29.860 --> 04:31.993
I'm gonna be going to Princeton.

04:32.029 --> 04:34.763
Where's that, New York?
New Jersey.

04:34.798 --> 04:36.531
Princeton?
Why not Harvard?

04:36.566 --> 04:38.633
'Cause Grandaddy said
Harvard's full of pederasts.

04:38.669 --> 04:40.935
Whoa! Language.
Ladies at the table. Sorry, Mom.

04:40.971 --> 04:43.004
Wait, what'd he say?
Nothing you need to hear.

04:43.040 --> 04:45.040
I don't see how you could say
no to Harvard. They said no to him.

04:45.075 --> 04:47.809
M-My application was deferred.
Rejected.

04:47.844 --> 04:50.312
Well, Harvard's where all the
famous people went... presidents.

04:50.347 --> 04:52.180
President Wilson... President
Wilson went to Princeton.

04:52.215 --> 04:54.849
He did go to Princeton.

04:54.885 --> 04:57.552
Aren't you a little young
for college?

04:57.587 --> 05:00.121
You know, he's gonna be 17.

05:00.157 --> 05:02.390
And it was my idea
to have him apply.

05:03.694 --> 05:06.361
I'd have asked your opinion,
but you weren't here.

05:06.396 --> 05:08.396
So...

05:15.672 --> 05:17.672
My boy.

05:17.708 --> 05:19.674
Congratulations.

05:19.710 --> 05:21.009
Thanks, Daddy.

05:22.379 --> 05:24.646
Now, did I hear you say you're
going out after breakfast?

05:24.681 --> 05:26.581
Yeah. Going out
to see Pink Stewart

05:26.616 --> 05:27.849
about his mineral rights.

05:27.884 --> 05:29.651
He's trying to welsh
on the Colonel.

05:29.686 --> 05:32.687
I need to set it right,
get him to sign that paperwork.

05:32.723 --> 05:34.189
Gonna see anyone else?

05:36.126 --> 05:37.926
No.

05:37.961 --> 05:39.060
Just Pink.

05:41.398 --> 05:43.932
Charles, why don't you
come with me?

05:43.967 --> 05:47.335
Sure thing, Daddy.
Sounds good to me.

06:00.217 --> 06:01.216
Morning.

06:03.320 --> 06:06.054
Colonel McCullough, Sir.

06:07.257 --> 06:08.757
Don't bother.

06:08.792 --> 06:12.026
I fought for the South.

06:12.062 --> 06:14.362
Who the hell are you?

06:14.398 --> 06:17.098
Vincent Hastings, sir.
Here to pick up Phineas.

06:17.134 --> 06:19.267
We're going, uh, sparring.

06:19.302 --> 06:20.268
Boxing.

06:20.303 --> 06:22.070
Hmm.

06:22.105 --> 06:23.638
Mmm, I see you have the keys.

06:23.673 --> 06:25.206
Phineas!

06:27.644 --> 06:31.112
Your sparring partner is here.

06:31.148 --> 06:32.981
At ease, Vincent.

06:33.016 --> 06:36.418
Vincent, Daddy.

06:36.453 --> 06:38.620
We've got Brogan at noon.

06:38.655 --> 06:40.655
Brogan?
What about Looney?

06:40.690 --> 06:43.425
The A.G. has a full dance card.
Don't you read the papers?

06:43.460 --> 06:47.295
I don't drive 10 hours to talk
to a man I've already bought.

06:47.330 --> 06:48.963
That's what the telephone's for.

06:48.999 --> 06:51.099
It's been one day, Daddy.
This is what was possible

06:51.134 --> 06:53.234
for me to arrange in that time.
I'm still working on Looney.

06:53.270 --> 06:55.637
It may take a couple of days.

06:55.672 --> 06:57.305
All right?

06:57.340 --> 06:58.573
Noon.

06:58.608 --> 06:59.974
Mm.

07:00.010 --> 07:02.310
Don't get your teeth
knocked out.

07:05.982 --> 07:07.816
We may need
to work out a system.

07:07.851 --> 07:09.284
You mean so I don't pop over

07:09.319 --> 07:11.653
and run into your father?

07:11.688 --> 07:13.254
"I don't love you, son."

07:13.290 --> 07:15.990
"I prefer your older brother.

07:16.026 --> 07:17.525
He's a real man."

07:17.561 --> 07:19.327
Shh.

07:19.362 --> 07:21.896
I am the older brother, asshole.

07:26.236 --> 07:28.937
Well, I can see how
the Colonel would feel like

07:28.972 --> 07:29.938
we had an agreement.

07:29.973 --> 07:32.006
So you didn't?

07:32.042 --> 07:34.509
I expected
he'd be drilling by now.

07:34.544 --> 07:37.145
You can't buy a lease and just
sit on it till doomsday.

07:37.180 --> 07:39.180
It ain't right. Come on, Pink.
You made a commitment.

07:39.216 --> 07:40.515
You gotta stick by it.

07:40.550 --> 07:43.785
My word's my bond...
normally.

07:43.820 --> 07:46.855
But I need the money.
My family needs it.

07:46.890 --> 07:49.390
Cattle ain't supplying it, and
the other fella's offering more.

07:49.426 --> 07:52.126
How much more?
A seventh.

07:52.162 --> 07:54.162
Plus a signing bonus.

07:54.197 --> 07:56.164
Can y'all match that?

07:56.199 --> 07:58.233
This other fella... I'm guessing
his name's Monahan...

07:58.268 --> 08:00.001
South Texas Improvement Company?

08:00.036 --> 08:01.236
That's him, all right.

08:01.271 --> 08:02.871
Just so you know
who you're dealing with.

08:02.906 --> 08:04.906
He's a front for
Standard Oil of Pennsylvania.

08:04.941 --> 08:07.876
And he's the one
who attacked my cattle.

08:07.911 --> 08:10.178
Shit.
That was him?

08:10.213 --> 08:13.681
You really want to do business
with a man like that?

08:13.717 --> 08:16.084
Well... maybe
there's people who'd say

08:16.119 --> 08:18.753
the McCulloughs' hands
ain't so clean neither.

08:18.788 --> 08:21.055
Like maybe the Garcias.

08:21.091 --> 08:22.924
I don't mean to give no offense,
but from what I heard...

08:22.959 --> 08:24.359
Sir, you are mistaken.

08:24.394 --> 08:27.896
It wasn't the McCulloughs.
It was the whole town.

08:27.931 --> 08:30.198
Our people went there
to arrest the same man

08:30.233 --> 08:33.268
who shot up our house
and shot my little brother.

08:33.303 --> 08:37.071
And my daddy here did everything
he could to prevent bloodshed.

08:37.107 --> 08:39.240
You can ask anyone
who was there.

08:40.477 --> 08:43.578
I'm sorry.
I regret bringing it up.

08:43.613 --> 08:45.880
It's a real damn shame.

08:45.916 --> 08:47.382
But the Garcias brought it
upon themselves.

08:47.417 --> 08:48.950
He apologized, son.

08:48.985 --> 08:50.585
Don't keep after him.

08:56.826 --> 09:00.562
We both know there's blood
in all this land.

09:00.597 --> 09:02.063
There's good
comes out of it, too,

09:02.098 --> 09:04.232
and I'm not just
talking a quick buck.

09:04.267 --> 09:08.536
That oil, it's been there
since the time of Adam.

09:08.572 --> 09:11.539
And if we let these foreign
companies get their hooks in,

09:11.575 --> 09:13.274
they're gonna drain this oil.

09:13.310 --> 09:15.877
It'll be just like Spindletop.
Biggest gusher in history.

09:15.912 --> 09:17.879
Where's that profit?

09:17.914 --> 09:20.148
They sucked it out,
they moved it to Pennsylvania,

09:20.183 --> 09:23.718
and they will do it again if...

09:23.753 --> 09:25.086
if we let 'em.

09:26.823 --> 09:28.790
I'm not gonna match their offer.

09:28.825 --> 09:30.124
I can't.

09:30.160 --> 09:32.460
So it's up to you, Pink.

09:32.495 --> 09:33.828
If you want to be the one

09:33.863 --> 09:36.164
that lets Standard
take what's ours...

09:38.501 --> 09:40.134
...I can't stop you.

09:46.977 --> 09:48.343
You got that paper on you?

09:49.980 --> 09:51.212
I do.

10:00.056 --> 10:01.856
That was amazing.
You talked ol' Pink

10:01.891 --> 10:03.591
from a seventh
down to an eighth.

10:03.627 --> 10:05.627
Hell,
I thought for a second we might

10:05.662 --> 10:07.795
have to come back tonight
and rough him up a little.

10:07.831 --> 10:08.963
Don't say that.

10:11.568 --> 10:12.533
Sorry.

10:16.239 --> 10:18.539
I think we should do more of this...
ride around together.

10:18.575 --> 10:20.842
You can teach me
the oil business.

10:20.877 --> 10:22.343
I think I'd be great at it.

10:22.379 --> 10:24.112
Be like Granddaddy, you know?

10:35.825 --> 10:38.826
So, tell me all about
them Yankee interlopers of yours.

10:38.862 --> 10:40.528
Well, they're hurting us, Cal.

10:40.563 --> 10:43.364
Coming at us with blind tigers,
incorporated in Texas,

10:43.400 --> 10:45.333
but the money's
out of Pennsylvania.

10:45.368 --> 10:47.869
Hmm. These foreigners
can outbid us,

10:47.904 --> 10:50.538
outspend us ten-to-one,
and beat us at distribution.

10:50.573 --> 10:52.206
Well, what do you hear
from the A.G.?

10:52.242 --> 10:53.474
Still setting a meeting.

10:54.611 --> 10:56.678
I wouldn't bother with it.

10:56.713 --> 10:58.880
Looney's in the tank
for Standard...

10:58.915 --> 11:00.548
Common knowledge.

11:00.583 --> 11:03.418
If it's common knowledge, why
isn't something done about it?

11:03.453 --> 11:05.653
The fallen state of man.

11:10.927 --> 11:12.627
I want to know the truth.

11:14.698 --> 11:16.998
Did they get to you, Cal?

11:17.033 --> 11:18.599
Standard?
Mm-hmm.

11:18.635 --> 11:22.036
Hell no.
I've never taken a dime.

11:22.072 --> 11:24.238
What about
South Texas Improvement?

11:24.274 --> 11:27.075
They have been very generous.

11:27.110 --> 11:28.910
They are Standard.

11:28.945 --> 11:30.678
Well, if that's true,

11:30.714 --> 11:33.247
how come the Attorney General's
not on 'em?

11:33.283 --> 11:35.183
Sounds like you've jumped
out of my pocket

11:35.218 --> 11:37.251
and into my enemy's.

11:37.287 --> 11:40.922
Now, hear me out.
Sure, I like the money.

11:40.957 --> 11:42.857
But I hate those foreigners
coming in here

11:42.892 --> 11:44.392
as much as you do.

11:44.427 --> 11:46.594
Now, if I can cut the legs
out from under them

11:46.629 --> 11:50.398
without nicking
the money supply,

11:50.433 --> 11:53.768
well, then all of us here
at this table ought to be happy.

11:53.803 --> 11:56.804
What are you proposing?

11:56.840 --> 11:59.640
What if I was to tell you
there's a vacancy coming up

11:59.676 --> 12:02.777
on the Texas Railroad
Commission?

12:02.812 --> 12:05.113
Oh, I think I might
piss my pants, Cal.

12:05.148 --> 12:06.781
Might die from exhilaration.

12:06.816 --> 12:08.583
Three bureaucrats sitting
in a government office

12:08.618 --> 12:10.118
pricing railroad tickets.

12:10.153 --> 12:11.786
Not for long.

12:11.821 --> 12:13.454
Now, listen.

12:13.490 --> 12:16.457
Nobody knows this...
Not even Standard...

12:16.493 --> 12:19.627
But come the end
of next session,

12:19.662 --> 12:23.431
Texas will be directly
regulating the oil industry.

12:23.466 --> 12:27.268
And they're gonna do it
through the Railroad Commission.

12:27.303 --> 12:31.305
I'm talking every aspect
of the oil business.

12:31.341 --> 12:33.608
Production quotas...

12:33.643 --> 12:35.576
You fellas won't be able
to drill a quart

12:35.612 --> 12:37.578
without the Commission's say-so.

12:37.614 --> 12:40.014
And neither will Standard.

12:40.049 --> 12:42.416
So you get yourself
on that commission,

12:42.452 --> 12:44.352
you can bring Standard
to their knees.

12:50.193 --> 12:52.493
Can we buy you lunch, Cal?

12:53.830 --> 12:56.330
What'd your daddy say about it?

12:56.366 --> 12:58.432
The Colonel wants me
on the Commission

12:58.468 --> 13:00.268
like a dog wants his own balls.

13:01.571 --> 13:02.937
Well, maybe he's right.

13:02.972 --> 13:04.839
He's never right.

13:04.874 --> 13:06.307
Even when he's right,
he's wrong.

13:06.342 --> 13:08.509
Finn, you need to step back.

13:08.545 --> 13:10.845
Nope. If I take this,
it bars me

13:10.880 --> 13:12.947
from holding a place
on the board of McCullough Oil.

13:12.982 --> 13:14.649
I'd be handing the whole
damn enterprise to Pete

13:14.684 --> 13:16.717
with a red bow tied around it.

13:16.753 --> 13:19.387
It's already his, ain't it?

13:19.422 --> 13:21.022
Your words.

13:21.057 --> 13:22.323
Look at it clinically.

13:22.358 --> 13:24.892
Rather not, thank you.

13:24.928 --> 13:26.894
This new version
of the Railroad Commission

13:26.930 --> 13:29.297
sounds like a powerful position.

13:29.332 --> 13:31.299
Sounds like the only thing
wrong with it

13:31.334 --> 13:33.801
is that he wants you there.

13:33.837 --> 13:36.170
Can't keep jumping through hoops
for him my whole life.

13:36.206 --> 13:37.705
Won't stop until I make it stop.

13:37.740 --> 13:39.307
I'm no politician.

13:39.342 --> 13:41.075
Nor are you a backgammon player.

13:41.110 --> 13:44.045
But I see how
this government thing works.

13:44.080 --> 13:46.080
Spend a few years
at a big job like that,

13:46.115 --> 13:47.715
then you go back
to the private sector.

13:47.750 --> 13:50.985
You won't even have to go back
to your father's company.

13:51.020 --> 13:54.055
You become one of those
highly paid advisors.

13:54.090 --> 13:55.556
You could go anywhere.

13:55.592 --> 13:58.492
Shell, Humble Oil.

13:58.528 --> 14:00.061
Standard.

14:02.398 --> 14:04.599
Oh, the look
on the old man's face...

14:04.634 --> 14:06.934
Be worth it just for that.

14:08.371 --> 14:11.172
You owe him nothing.

14:11.207 --> 14:13.174
He made his choice.

14:13.209 --> 14:16.978
Way I see it, he's
your brother's problem now.

14:22.785 --> 14:24.385
The back door's locked.

14:29.626 --> 14:30.958
I've been thinking...

14:33.096 --> 14:34.762
...about
the Railroad Commission.

14:36.900 --> 14:38.132
I'll do it.

14:39.636 --> 14:42.069
It might provide options
for the future.

14:44.841 --> 14:46.073
I'm glad.

14:47.911 --> 14:48.976
I know...

14:51.648 --> 14:54.615
I know life has not
dealt you a good hand.

14:54.651 --> 14:56.450
Hell...

14:56.486 --> 14:58.819
neither have I, sometimes.

14:58.855 --> 15:02.556
You've always stood by me.

15:02.592 --> 15:05.526
And I thank you for that.

15:08.965 --> 15:10.631
Get my bag.

15:17.721 --> 15:20.289
I've been thinking a lot
about what I'm gonna do

15:20.324 --> 15:22.758
when I graduate the Ivy League.

15:22.794 --> 15:24.627
Be a lawyer like my uncle,
diplomat, maybe.

15:24.662 --> 15:27.263
Whatever it is, gonna have
nothing to do with cows.

15:30.501 --> 15:33.002
Oh, sorry.

15:33.037 --> 15:35.504
You... You shitbird!

15:35.540 --> 15:36.906
Not so uppity now.

15:36.941 --> 15:38.841
What's the matter with you?

15:38.876 --> 15:40.976
You think that's funny?

15:41.012 --> 15:42.611
Out of my seat, Tommy.

15:42.647 --> 15:43.946
Or what?

15:43.981 --> 15:46.015
You gonna sic
your boyfriend on me?

15:46.050 --> 15:48.651
You gonna recite a poem?

15:48.686 --> 15:51.020
At least I can read and write.

15:51.055 --> 15:53.322
Why do you even bother
coming to school?

15:53.357 --> 15:55.257
Jonas.

15:55.293 --> 15:58.461
You just... like the way
the chalk tastes?

15:58.496 --> 15:59.829
Jonas, shut up.

16:02.700 --> 16:04.533
Least my daddy didn't
run across the border

16:04.569 --> 16:06.001
with some Mexican whore.

16:23.821 --> 16:25.888
Tell me what happened.

16:25.923 --> 16:28.524
Tell me what happened.

16:28.559 --> 16:29.959
I didn't mean to hurt him.

16:29.994 --> 16:32.194
You meant to walk up
behind him with no warning,

16:32.230 --> 16:35.331
hit him in the back of the head
with a bag full of books,

16:35.366 --> 16:36.565
and not hurt him?

16:36.601 --> 16:38.134
Must have been the buckle.

16:38.169 --> 16:39.468
Why?!

16:39.504 --> 16:41.537
What's your excuse?
What did he do?

16:41.572 --> 16:43.572
Come on, Jeannie. What the hell
set you off like that?

16:43.608 --> 16:44.774
What did Jonas say?

16:47.111 --> 16:48.544
What are you afraid he said?

16:56.387 --> 16:58.521
Tommy was picking on Jonas.

16:58.556 --> 17:00.022
He always does,
and I'm tired of it.

17:00.057 --> 17:01.023
I'm sorry.

17:01.058 --> 17:02.758
That's not enough!

17:02.794 --> 17:05.493
This story's not gonna go away,
you know. It's gonna follow you.

17:05.530 --> 17:07.563
And is this how you want people
to think of you...

17:07.598 --> 17:08.897
As a violent, crazy...

17:08.933 --> 17:10.866
He was talking about Daddy!

17:16.941 --> 17:19.708
Tell me what he said.

17:19.743 --> 17:21.242
Every word.

17:25.750 --> 17:27.550
He said that Daddy left us

17:27.585 --> 17:30.052
and ran off
with a Mexican whore.

17:53.811 --> 17:57.112
Not a word of that is true.

17:57.148 --> 17:58.447
Not a word.

18:00.484 --> 18:02.651
I swear to you.

18:11.295 --> 18:13.162
Go on to your room.

19:17.828 --> 19:19.728
Oh, shit.

19:29.373 --> 19:31.340
Uh...

20:14.652 --> 20:15.818
- Ah.
- Mm.

21:21.185 --> 21:22.651
You want to talk about it?

21:24.789 --> 21:26.255
I think you wanna talk about it.

21:30.361 --> 21:32.328
Okay, how about I talk and you
jump in when you're ready?

21:32.363 --> 21:34.296
I'm holding weapons.

21:34.332 --> 21:37.166
Fat Wolf doesn't want to
move camps because you do.

21:37.201 --> 21:39.835
He'd set his head on fire in
a second if you told him not to.

21:41.739 --> 21:43.005
What is it between you two?

21:46.877 --> 21:49.812
His mother shamed me.

21:49.847 --> 21:53.015
She was my wife, and she laid
with another warrior.

21:53.050 --> 21:54.850
They were all sent away.

21:54.885 --> 21:55.918
Exiled?

21:57.221 --> 21:58.487
Fat Wolf, too?

22:00.057 --> 22:01.690
How old was he?

22:01.726 --> 22:03.959
I don't know.

22:03.995 --> 22:06.228
Pretty young.

22:06.264 --> 22:08.731
Wanted to go with his mother,
so I let him.

22:10.601 --> 22:13.836
They were going back
to his mother's people.

22:13.871 --> 22:16.205
But they were killed
by the whites.

22:16.240 --> 22:18.641
Fat Wolf was captured.

22:18.676 --> 22:20.542
Kept him in a fort
for a couple years

22:20.578 --> 22:22.211
before he escaped.

22:26.017 --> 22:29.685
A son can hate his father,
but he cannot disrespect him.

22:29.720 --> 22:31.654
It's not allowed.

22:31.689 --> 22:33.355
Dishonors them both.

22:37.762 --> 22:39.395
You need to make peace with him.

22:41.132 --> 22:43.332
There was frost this morning.

22:43.367 --> 22:44.767
Winter's here.

22:44.802 --> 22:46.568
If we get kicked out,

22:46.604 --> 22:48.537
my wife and my baby
won't make it.

23:44.026 --> 23:46.861
Good. Good lesson.
Keep working the Rachmaninoff.

23:46.896 --> 23:49.396
And just know that he had
big hands, just like you do.

23:49.432 --> 23:50.865
Why should I know that?

23:50.900 --> 23:52.766
I can think of no reason.

23:52.802 --> 23:54.902
Well done.
See you next Wednesday.

23:54.937 --> 23:56.003
All right.

23:57.807 --> 24:01.508
I, um... I want to thank you
for, uh, the...

24:01.544 --> 24:03.611
But I-I think
you should take it back.

24:05.248 --> 24:09.049
Have I scandalized you, ma'am?

24:09.085 --> 24:10.618
No.

24:19.996 --> 24:21.562
It's just like a cigarette.

24:21.597 --> 24:23.397
Well, I don't know
why you would assume

24:23.432 --> 24:25.566
that I know how
to smoke a cigarette.

24:25.601 --> 24:28.202
You do live on a ranch.

24:30.673 --> 24:32.273
Oh, fair enough.

24:32.308 --> 24:34.808
You know...

24:34.844 --> 24:37.411
it does more
than just relax you.

24:37.446 --> 24:39.413
It also makes you tell
the absolute truth.

24:39.448 --> 24:41.649
So we're playing kid's games?

24:41.684 --> 24:43.584
All right.
You start.

24:43.619 --> 24:48.055
You tell me something
that is the absolute truth.

24:48.090 --> 24:49.123
Okay.

24:52.295 --> 24:53.827
I hate children.

24:56.198 --> 24:58.465
What?
Honestly, I hate children...

24:58.501 --> 25:00.668
Well, "hate" is a strong word.

25:00.703 --> 25:03.404
I intensely dislike them.
They're boring.

25:03.439 --> 25:05.172
Jonas is no exception.

25:06.609 --> 25:09.777
You intensely dislike Jonas?

25:09.812 --> 25:11.645
My son?

25:11.681 --> 25:14.248
Well, he's a fine young man,
as far as it goes.

25:14.283 --> 25:15.716
He's talented.

25:15.751 --> 25:17.117
He's got the makings
of an interesting person,

25:17.153 --> 25:19.787
but there's no guarantee
he'll get there.

25:19.822 --> 25:21.155
And most of them don't, do they?

25:26.796 --> 25:28.462
Your turn.

25:28.497 --> 25:29.863
For what?

25:31.667 --> 25:35.002
To tell me something
completely honest.

25:45.381 --> 25:48.248
I think...

25:48.284 --> 25:49.850
I believe...

25:53.055 --> 25:55.622
...my husband killed a man
in this room.

26:16.312 --> 26:18.645
Hernando.

26:18.681 --> 26:19.646
Hernando qu?

26:19.682 --> 26:20.981
Rojas.

26:21.017 --> 26:23.384
Eduardo Lopez.

26:23.419 --> 26:25.452
Claudio.

27:24.246 --> 27:25.746
Manuel.

27:43.799 --> 27:44.898
Teresa.

28:31.947 --> 28:33.347
Tenga buen dia, Senora.

28:33.382 --> 28:34.648
Gracias, Manuel.

29:06.629 --> 29:09.764
The vaqueros
were of limited use anyway.

29:09.800 --> 29:12.600
All they knew about
is the actual attack.

29:12.636 --> 29:15.103
They know that Eli McCullough's
men shot first.

29:15.138 --> 29:16.738
That's good.

29:16.773 --> 29:20.308
I'm not discounting
the importance of that.

29:20.343 --> 29:23.611
Do you want your land back?

29:23.647 --> 29:26.614
Don't talk down to me.

29:26.650 --> 29:28.783
Of course I do.

29:28.819 --> 29:31.920
Then you're gonna
have to gird yourself...

29:31.955 --> 29:35.457
do things you'd rather not do.

29:35.492 --> 29:38.993
If you want justice,
you've got to drill deep,

29:39.029 --> 29:41.896
and you got to drill
in the right place.

29:41.932 --> 29:44.799
We've got to prove
a whole conspiracy...

29:44.835 --> 29:47.735
Burning the bar,
inciting the vigilantes,

29:47.771 --> 29:49.471
forging the tax records,

29:49.506 --> 29:51.606
faking the auction,
bribing the judge.

29:51.641 --> 29:54.642
And these are things that you
don't have personal knowledge of.

29:54.678 --> 29:58.246
I know my father paid his taxes.

29:58.281 --> 30:02.250
I would sooner doubt
the Scriptures, Senora.

30:02.285 --> 30:04.552
But we need somebody
who was on the inside.

30:06.356 --> 30:10.558
Someone who heard the villains
admit to their atrocities.

30:13.163 --> 30:15.897
Did you have someone
particular in mind?

30:49.566 --> 30:51.900
I need your help.

30:51.935 --> 30:53.167
You need money?

30:53.203 --> 30:55.136
No, Peter.

30:55.171 --> 30:56.371
Well, it's too late now.

30:56.406 --> 30:57.906
Whatever you have to
ask me now, I can't.

30:57.941 --> 30:59.908
I tried.
You know I tried.

30:59.943 --> 31:02.310
Yes.
I know you did.

31:03.613 --> 31:06.381
But that's over.

31:06.416 --> 31:08.650
I'm home now.

31:08.685 --> 31:11.719
I don't blame you
for returning to your family.

31:11.755 --> 31:13.421
I understand that you hate me
for what I di...

31:13.456 --> 31:14.522
I don't.

31:19.195 --> 31:21.829
I wanted to hurt someone.

31:21.865 --> 31:23.631
I was... I...

31:31.441 --> 31:32.740
I got a new one.

31:40.450 --> 31:42.450
Why are you here?

31:42.485 --> 31:45.186
I'm alone in the world, Peter.

31:45.221 --> 31:47.789
And I have nothing.

31:47.824 --> 31:51.125
Nothing except the truth
about what happened here.

31:54.097 --> 31:56.064
What are you saying?

31:56.099 --> 32:00.068
That you are thinking
you can take down the Colonel?

32:00.103 --> 32:02.604
There are people helping me.

32:02.639 --> 32:04.138
But I need you.

32:05.742 --> 32:06.975
If you back my story, we can...

32:07.010 --> 32:09.243
I can't. If you know
anything about me...

32:09.279 --> 32:12.213
I know that you're a good man.

32:12.248 --> 32:15.283
You see your father
for what he really is.

32:20.857 --> 32:23.491
You know he needs to be stopped.

32:28.498 --> 32:30.765
I can't do it without you.

32:36.339 --> 32:39.140
I have to go.

32:39.175 --> 32:41.743
Please...

32:41.778 --> 32:43.311
don't come back here.

33:13.710 --> 33:15.610
Maria Garcia
came and talked to me.

33:21.051 --> 33:23.017
This afternoon.

33:23.053 --> 33:24.218
Yeah?

33:26.656 --> 33:27.955
She said she wanted me to talk

33:27.991 --> 33:30.091
about what happened
to the Garcias.

33:34.431 --> 33:36.798
I think
she's coming after you...

33:36.833 --> 33:37.932
In court.

33:39.569 --> 33:41.502
For what, exactly?

33:41.538 --> 33:43.671
I don't know... all of it.

33:43.707 --> 33:45.073
She's got nothing.

33:47.377 --> 33:49.110
She'd want her land back.

33:51.214 --> 33:55.516
Well, it's not me
she's coming after, then, is it?

33:55.552 --> 33:57.719
It's us.

33:57.754 --> 33:59.353
This whole family.

34:02.225 --> 34:03.991
I guess so.

34:04.027 --> 34:06.260
What did you say?

34:06.296 --> 34:08.830
I said she should
leave me alone.

34:08.864 --> 34:10.098
And she did.

34:12.135 --> 34:13.167
That's it?

34:14.904 --> 34:17.237
She said she had...

34:17.273 --> 34:19.873
help.

34:19.909 --> 34:22.076
Given everything else going on,
I'd say it's a fair bet

34:22.112 --> 34:24.212
Standard's backing her.

34:43.399 --> 34:45.032
You didn't have to tell us.

34:49.105 --> 34:50.772
Thank you.

37:20.396 --> 37:21.528
Senora.

37:21.563 --> 37:24.097
If you could spare a moment.

37:47.756 --> 37:49.923
What do you want?

37:49.958 --> 37:52.693
For one, I want to apologize.

37:52.728 --> 37:54.094
When I...

37:57.266 --> 37:59.933
On that day...

37:59.968 --> 38:02.703
it was never my intention
for anyone to die...

38:02.738 --> 38:04.938
Women and children,
least of all.

38:04.973 --> 38:07.708
It got out of hand.

38:07.743 --> 38:09.543
I do not to expect you
to accept that,

38:09.578 --> 38:12.713
but it is the truth.

38:12.748 --> 38:15.582
I will say one more thing.

38:15.617 --> 38:17.951
Though you may
find it grotesque,

38:17.986 --> 38:20.087
it is also the truth.

38:23.158 --> 38:24.858
I know how you feel...

38:27.196 --> 38:28.729
...to see your family
slaughtered

38:28.764 --> 38:30.197
in front of your eyes.

38:33.802 --> 38:35.068
Do you know how it feels

38:35.104 --> 38:37.437
to sit across from the man
who did it?

38:41.543 --> 38:44.077
I do.

38:44.113 --> 38:45.979
His name was Toshaway.

38:46.014 --> 38:47.881
He was a Comanche chief.

38:49.518 --> 38:51.084
I came...

38:52.721 --> 38:54.588
...in time...

38:54.623 --> 38:56.823
to look upon him as a father.

38:58.293 --> 39:00.994
Many years later on,

39:01.029 --> 39:03.930
after the Apaches killed
my wife and my oldest boy,

39:03.966 --> 39:06.333
it was different.

39:07.369 --> 39:08.702
I tracked them down,

39:08.737 --> 39:11.772
and I killed them all
with their families.

39:11.807 --> 39:14.408
I learned what it was like
to take revenge.

39:17.413 --> 39:19.246
But having a father was better.

39:23.185 --> 39:25.218
One moment.
One moment.

39:31.693 --> 39:32.659
It's an offer.

39:34.696 --> 39:38.064
Twice what any other
landowner is getting.

39:38.100 --> 39:40.734
A one-third royalty deal
on all the oil produced

39:40.769 --> 39:44.004
on what was your family's land
till the end of time.

39:47.776 --> 39:49.576
All you have to do is leave.

39:51.413 --> 39:52.879
For good.

39:56.051 --> 39:59.219
I suggest you have a lawyer
look this over for you.

39:59.254 --> 40:00.921
There's more money
in that piece of paper

40:00.956 --> 40:03.590
than any deal you could strike
with Standard Oil.

40:03.625 --> 40:05.826
Even if you won back every inch

40:05.861 --> 40:07.427
and half my ranch
for good measure,

40:07.463 --> 40:09.496
you would never see
this much money.

40:12.768 --> 40:16.169
And if my family had lived

40:16.205 --> 40:19.406
and not been driven
off our lands...

40:19.441 --> 40:22.742
and we had drilled
our own oil...

40:22.778 --> 40:25.378
Like you are doing...

40:25.414 --> 40:27.447
Then we'd have all of it.

40:29.985 --> 40:32.619
Look around us, Senora.

40:32.654 --> 40:35.222
How many families like yours,

40:35.257 --> 40:38.291
the old hidalgo families,
are left in Texas?

40:42.397 --> 40:45.966
So, this is
what you tell yourself?

40:46.001 --> 40:47.234
That if it hadn't been you,

40:47.269 --> 40:49.102
it would have been
somebody else?

40:49.137 --> 40:50.604
Their time had passed.

40:50.639 --> 40:53.773
Because men like you
made it pass.

40:55.444 --> 40:58.812
We're saying the same thing.
You just don't realize it.

40:58.847 --> 41:01.815
This is your chance to move on,
like I have many times...

41:01.850 --> 41:03.216
Like Pete has to now.
Pete?

41:03.252 --> 41:04.818
He risked his life for you.

41:04.853 --> 41:07.420
He turned his back on his family
to get you to safety.

41:07.456 --> 41:09.456
Now he's trying
to repair that damage

41:09.491 --> 41:13.226
and get his three children
back their father.

41:13.262 --> 41:15.128
Whatever you think of me...

41:17.266 --> 41:19.399
...they, at least,
are innocent.

41:39.187 --> 41:41.588
I will take this to my lawyers.

41:48.564 --> 41:51.998
Perhaps they will find a way
of using it against you.

41:57.172 --> 41:59.606
So, that's it, then, is it?

41:59.641 --> 42:03.143
You're out to destroy me,
plain and simple.

42:04.179 --> 42:06.046
Yes.

42:07.305 --> 42:13.541
