00:01.401 --> 00:03.881
Narrator:
In New York City war on crime,

00:03.904 --> 00:07.408
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:07.441 --> 00:08.886
of the Major Case Squad.

00:08.909 --> 00:11.446
These are their stories.

00:12.846 --> 00:15.190
She's everywhere. A whole article on her.

00:15.215 --> 00:17.661
Like she's the only Mafia
daughter in New York City!

00:17.684 --> 00:20.130
Like I'm not still famous!

00:20.153 --> 00:22.599
Ilana, "Daughter of a Russian Don"

00:22.623 --> 00:25.832
was a terrific book-- five years ago.

00:25.859 --> 00:28.897
Or haven't you noticed
your royalty checks got smaller?

00:28.929 --> 00:31.170
Noah, please,

00:31.198 --> 00:33.474
can't you call one of your
influential friends,

00:33.500 --> 00:35.707
get me a little job?

00:35.736 --> 00:37.807
Little jobs have little salaries.

00:37.838 --> 00:40.114
You want the big money again,
bring me another book.

00:41.108 --> 00:43.110
Woman reporter: Mr. Yushka,

00:43.143 --> 00:45.054
you think a life sentence is fair?

00:45.078 --> 00:46.785
Are you going to appeal this?

00:46.813 --> 00:49.089
- Ilana: Papa!
- Photographer: Look this way, sir!

00:49.116 --> 00:53.462
You are not his daughter. Life in prison.
Life in prison, because of you.

00:53.487 --> 00:56.024
Because of you!

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074

01:06.166 --> 01:07.668
( car door shuts )

01:12.139 --> 01:14.380
( doorbell buzzes )

01:22.049 --> 01:24.051
Oh, God, Kenny.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.792
Ice. I need ice.

01:30.257 --> 01:34.171
I couldn't go home. I don't want
Martha to see me like this.

01:36.830 --> 01:40.437
I have a broken rib.

01:43.937 --> 01:46.008
(huffs)

01:46.039 --> 01:48.110
I will take you to the hospital.

01:48.141 --> 01:51.748
Don't be an idiot. You are so rude.

01:51.778 --> 01:54.952
I was going to ask you how it went today,
but if you're going to be a bitch--

01:54.982 --> 01:57.622
I'm allowed to be a bitch today.
My father will die in jail.

01:57.651 --> 02:00.222
Your book had nothing to do with it.

02:01.388 --> 02:03.629
It was the most liberating
thing you've ever done.

02:03.657 --> 02:06.035
I don't understand why you
don't write another one.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.445
I will take it.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.538
Are you sure you can afford it?

02:15.569 --> 02:19.517
I'm a writer, Sasha. When
writers need money, they write.

02:19.539 --> 02:21.917
And I will write a new book.

02:27.214 --> 02:29.820
( speaking Russian )

02:44.498 --> 02:46.535
Noah: You tell his agent that for 15%

02:46.566 --> 02:48.637
he can bloody well edit the book himself.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.706
What's that? Shouldn't we have it x-rayed?

02:50.737 --> 02:53.343
It's from Ilana Yushka.
Feels like a manuscript.

02:53.373 --> 02:55.683
What? If she's been holding out on me--

02:55.709 --> 02:57.882
( screams )

03:01.048 --> 03:04.586
Oh, dear God! Call the police! Now!

03:07.254 --> 03:11.566
( theme music playing )

03:56.336 --> 03:58.373
Now give me a big close-up

03:58.405 --> 04:00.885
of this smudge on her forehead.

04:02.509 --> 04:04.546
I spoke with her yesterday afternoon.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.558
She said she had an idea
for her next book. A big idea.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.582
- Eames: Which was?
- She wanted to tell me in person

04:08.615 --> 04:10.617
to see the look on my face.
But what else could it be?

04:10.650 --> 04:12.789
The Russian mob's all she knew.

04:12.819 --> 04:15.322
The messenger service said they
picked up the box at 319 Hudson.

04:15.355 --> 04:17.961
- Is that her address?
- Chinese restaurant next door.

04:17.991 --> 04:21.200
Her building doesn't have a doorman.
All pickups and deliveries go there.

04:21.228 --> 04:23.765
I really need to speak to them--
they're with Legal.

04:25.232 --> 04:27.269
You lose a contact lens?

04:28.835 --> 04:31.076
I need long tweezers.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.448
There's something in her mouth.

04:33.473 --> 04:35.680
Take pictures.

04:36.843 --> 04:39.119
( camera shutter clicks )

04:45.952 --> 04:47.556
What do you think this means?

04:47.587 --> 04:49.828
Robbery wasn't the motive?

04:55.428 --> 04:58.568
It's a receipt for a necklace
from two days ago.

04:58.598 --> 05:00.771
She was already spending her advance.

05:00.801 --> 05:04.681
Ostrensky's in Brighton Beach.
Nothing like rubbing it in their faces.

05:04.704 --> 05:08.481
She's got legal pads filled with her
handwriting. She still wrote in Russian.

05:08.508 --> 05:12.547
If you tell me you can
read Russian-- oh, brother.

05:12.579 --> 05:14.490
The restaurant owner downstairs says

05:14.514 --> 05:16.892
a blonde woman dropped
the package off yesterday.

05:16.917 --> 05:20.023
So someone who knew Ilana's
routine-- maybe a friend?

05:21.021 --> 05:23.160
Yeah. A friend...

05:23.190 --> 05:25.534
Who was buzzed in with the killer.

05:25.559 --> 05:28.005
Might explain why there was no forced entry.

05:28.028 --> 05:30.167
Assuming she was killed here.

05:31.898 --> 05:34.378
Not just killed.

05:42.576 --> 05:45.716
That's lye. She went down the drain.

05:45.745 --> 05:48.225
Only the bones would be left.

05:49.282 --> 05:52.354
Goren: The decapitation,
the disposal of the body,

05:52.385 --> 05:55.457
it has all the characteristics
of a Russian mob hit, Mr. Yushka.

05:55.488 --> 05:57.559
Eames: This is what we're talking about.

05:57.591 --> 05:59.696
The rest of your lovely daughter
was turned into pudding

05:59.726 --> 06:02.104
and washed down a sewer pipe.

06:02.128 --> 06:04.836
We know that it's not what you wanted.
We know you had no choice.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.209
He doesn't know what you're talking about.

06:07.234 --> 06:09.305
If you had said no, they
would have done it anyway.

06:09.336 --> 06:11.680
And the rest of your family
would have been next.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.707
In the long run, it makes no difference.

06:13.740 --> 06:17.244
They know it's going to eat at you.
They know you're going to want revenge.

06:17.277 --> 06:20.087
Eames: They won't wait.
They’ll come after you.

06:22.115 --> 06:24.459
Make the first strike, Mr. Yushka.

06:24.484 --> 06:26.555
Give us the names of the people who did this!

06:26.586 --> 06:30.500
( signal buzzes, banging )

06:30.523 --> 06:33.003
You have nothing better to do
than harass an old man?

06:33.026 --> 06:34.733
We can always harass you.

06:34.761 --> 06:37.571
According to the visitor's
log, you visited Mr. Yushka

06:37.597 --> 06:39.736
one day before his daughter was killed.

06:39.766 --> 06:41.768
You were accompanied by a Mr. Oleg Namirov?

06:42.769 --> 06:44.840
He's a translator for Mr. Yushka.

06:44.871 --> 06:48.250
You signed out at 2:40. Mr.
Namirov didn't sign out until 2:50.

06:48.275 --> 06:52.052
He spent 10 minutes alone with Mr. Yushka.

06:52.078 --> 06:55.491
We're curious, what was he translating?

07:03.957 --> 07:06.961
Oleg Namirov's a suspect
in half a dozen mob hits.

07:06.993 --> 07:09.803
Unfortunately, he always seems to be
on an airplane the day of the murders.

07:09.829 --> 07:11.934
What about Wednesday?

07:11.965 --> 07:14.172
Well, let's see what the reports say.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.373
The Bureau has him under surveillance.

07:16.403 --> 07:18.849
Well, 24/7 is a little more
than we can manage right now,

07:18.872 --> 07:21.011
but we do bed checks.

07:21.041 --> 07:24.614
Wednesday, 8:15, his car was parked outside

07:24.644 --> 07:26.817
his mistress's apartment in Sheepshead Bay.

07:26.846 --> 07:31.056
His mistress, she's blonde, right?

07:31.084 --> 07:36.397
Oleg was here Wednesday. We stay
in, we watch TV, we eat dinner.

07:36.423 --> 07:39.302
When you stayed in, you mean you
stayed in Ilana's Yushka's apartment?

07:39.326 --> 07:41.704
- What are you talking about?
- The time it took your boyfriend

07:41.728 --> 07:43.799
to liquefy her body in the bathtub.

07:43.830 --> 07:47.869
That is lie. Oleg was here, with me.

07:47.901 --> 07:50.006
You just came back from a trip?

07:50.036 --> 07:51.379
Woman: No.

07:51.404 --> 07:54.510
I'll bet I can guess where you and Oleg went.

07:54.541 --> 07:59.012
Oh! South. And you left Wednesday night.

08:00.380 --> 08:02.326
You're wrong, smart guy.

08:02.349 --> 08:05.387
We were leaving tonight-- to Hawaii.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.864
That is west.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.807
The airline confirms Oleg Namirov
bought tickets for Hawaii

08:15.829 --> 08:19.675
two hours after visiting Boris Yushka
in prison. The tickets were for tonight.

08:19.699 --> 08:22.737
If Mr. Namirov was true to form,

08:22.769 --> 08:26.649
he was going to do the hit on Ilana
tonight and then jump on a plane.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.778
Well, we were right about one thing.

08:28.808 --> 08:31.379
The Russian mob was planning to kill her.

08:32.379 --> 08:35.155
Except somebody beat them to it.

08:46.559 --> 08:48.971
( faint splash )

08:50.397 --> 08:52.741
Hey, gorgeous. You feeding the fishies?

08:52.766 --> 08:55.246
You going to be feeding
the fishies all night long?

08:55.268 --> 08:59.307
Oh, jeez. My mistake.

09:07.180 --> 09:09.285
Ilana had these photos on her desk.

09:09.315 --> 09:11.386
Probably old friends from high school.

09:11.418 --> 09:15.127
Maybe that was her next project:
"I was a Russian Homecoming Queen."

09:16.689 --> 09:19.226
This is her on her prom night.

09:20.727 --> 09:25.369
“Ilana and Kenny, the Waldorf, 1982."

09:25.398 --> 09:27.708
For what it's worth,

09:27.734 --> 09:30.044
the feds aren't convinced
this wasn't a mob hit.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.380
Tell them to keep an open mind.
That's what we do.

09:32.405 --> 09:35.784
What are you opening your minds to here?

09:35.809 --> 09:37.948
Translations of Ilana's writings.

09:40.046 --> 09:42.788
Maybe her new book wasn't about the mob.

09:42.816 --> 09:45.729
Maybe she found a whole new
group of people to piss off.

09:45.752 --> 09:48.062
Here, it looks like titles for a book.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.864
"Academy of Horrors," "Unusual Punishment,"

09:50.890 --> 09:53.097
"Tales Out of School."

09:53.126 --> 09:57.871
All right, this looks like copies of
Child Welfare cases filed in 1979.

09:58.932 --> 10:02.937
All with the same respondent,
the Chase Academy.

10:05.171 --> 10:07.242
Ilana mentioned it in her first book.

10:07.273 --> 10:10.015
It was a private school
for troubled teenagers.

10:10.043 --> 10:13.354
Rich, troubled teenagers.
We've got Kennedy cousins,

10:13.379 --> 10:15.552
we've got George Tate,
publisher of "The Ledger,"

10:15.582 --> 10:18.256
Arthur L. Korrigan Jr.

10:18.284 --> 10:21.231
Child Welfare went after the school
for beating the students.

10:21.254 --> 10:23.200
I smell a bestseller.

10:23.223 --> 10:25.499
I smell a motive for murder,

10:25.525 --> 10:29.337
especially if there was
more to it than just beatings.

10:29.362 --> 10:31.399
Word must have gotten out
she was writing a book.

10:31.431 --> 10:33.809
Maybe she talked to one of the other students.

10:33.833 --> 10:38.612
We can always ask the heir
to the Strick real estate fortune...

10:40.573 --> 10:44.316
Kenneth "Kenny" Strick.

10:44.344 --> 10:47.325
Her prom date.

10:51.351 --> 10:53.957
If any place deserved
an expose, it was Chase.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.160
That place was a horror.

10:58.091 --> 11:01.004
That's one of the titles Ilana was working on.

11:01.027 --> 11:03.132
"Academy of Horrors."

11:03.163 --> 11:06.372
If she'd told me she was planning a book,
I'd have warned her to be careful.

11:06.399 --> 11:10.040
Some of the staff at Chase were
sadists. Am I exaggerating?

11:10.069 --> 11:12.140
No.

11:14.541 --> 11:16.145
Is that where you two met?

11:16.176 --> 11:18.622
Us? No.

11:18.645 --> 11:20.716
We've known each other much longer than that.

11:20.747 --> 11:22.886
Martha's my sister.

11:25.919 --> 11:29.992
I went to Le Roset in Switzerland.
It's Kenny who was a handful.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.162
That's why our stepfather sent him to Chase.

11:32.192 --> 11:35.105
I'm sorry for the confusion.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.601
You were still in touch with Ilana?

11:39.632 --> 11:42.010
Chase was a bonding experience.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.106
We spoke now and then.

11:44.137 --> 11:46.811
The last time was when her
father was sent to prison.

11:46.839 --> 11:48.876
She was very upset.

11:48.908 --> 11:50.910
The book was the furthest
thing from her mind.

11:50.944 --> 11:53.322
Is there anyone else
she might have talked to?

11:53.346 --> 11:57.385
- Possible. I don't know.
- What about George?

12:00.954 --> 12:03.093
George?

12:03.122 --> 12:05.363
You mean George Tate,
the publisher of "The Ledger"?

12:05.391 --> 12:07.530
Martha: He and Ilana had a thing

12:07.560 --> 12:10.632
the summer after they graduated from Chase.

12:10.663 --> 12:13.576
I thought that you were her prom date?

12:14.567 --> 12:17.548
I had other plans.

12:17.570 --> 12:21.541
Ilana found George hanging
around the punch bowl.

12:28.147 --> 12:31.754
And now, I'm going for my walk.

12:31.784 --> 12:33.923
Ilana's death was shocking.

12:33.953 --> 12:37.730
If there's anything else
we can do, please call.

12:43.796 --> 12:47.175
Well, she never talked to me about a book.

12:47.200 --> 12:50.010
Frankly there wasn't enough going
on at Chase to sustain one.

12:50.036 --> 12:52.107
Physical abuse wasn't the tip of the iceberg?

12:52.138 --> 12:55.676
No, it was the iceberg. Believe me,
if there had been anything more,

12:55.708 --> 12:59.713
my father, who owned several newspapers,
would have been all over it.

12:59.746 --> 13:02.056
Maybe Ilana's exposé
wasn't about the staff at Chase.

13:02.081 --> 13:04.186
Maybe it was about the students.

13:04.217 --> 13:07.596
- What are you talking about?
- A co-ed boarding school full
of troubled teenagers--

13:07.620 --> 13:09.622
I'm getting flushed just thinking about it.

13:09.656 --> 13:11.829
Oh, get a grip, Detective. Ilana knew better.

13:11.858 --> 13:15.362
She had her own indiscretions to worry about.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.875
You can't mean indiscretions
with the opposite sex?

13:17.897 --> 13:19.968
Those wouldn't worry her.

13:19.999 --> 13:23.344
But... another girl at the school?

13:23.369 --> 13:25.849
She wouldn't write about it, so drop it.

13:25.872 --> 13:29.843
Ilana needed money. She had nothing to
lose, Maybe this other person does.

13:32.378 --> 13:35.120
Which one was she?

13:35.148 --> 13:38.288
This girl here, or this one?

13:39.719 --> 13:41.995
Ursula Stovitz.

13:42.021 --> 13:44.501
Who's Ursula Stovitz?

13:44.524 --> 13:48.836
I'm sure you've read her
holiday tips in her magazine:

13:48.861 --> 13:50.898
"Anna's Gracious Home."

13:50.930 --> 13:53.672
This is Anna Llewellyn?

13:53.700 --> 13:56.408
Is there any proof she
had an affair with Ilana?

13:56.436 --> 13:58.507
The story is Anna and Ilana

13:58.538 --> 14:01.985
broke curfew one Friday night--

14:02.008 --> 14:04.682
November, 1978, I think--

14:04.711 --> 14:06.713
they were arrested by the local sheriff

14:06.746 --> 14:08.748
while joy riding in the headmaster's car.

14:08.781 --> 14:11.227
And that means they were having an affair?

14:12.552 --> 14:15.499
They were seen kissing
and fondling each other

14:15.521 --> 14:17.592
in the parking lot of a bar.

14:22.095 --> 14:24.097
I was very saddened when I heard about Ilana.

14:24.130 --> 14:26.167
She and I shared some
difficult times at Chase.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.338
Where were you last Wednesday night?

14:28.368 --> 14:30.507
Here, waiting for a limo
to take me to the airport.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.777
- Alone?
- Yes, Mark and the children
were in Connecticut.

14:32.805 --> 14:35.615
Don't tell me I'm a suspect?

14:35.641 --> 14:37.348
We think Ms. Yushka was putting together

14:37.377 --> 14:39.448
a book about her years at the Chase Academy,

14:39.479 --> 14:42.858
a book that might have been
embarrassing for your wholesome image--

14:42.882 --> 14:44.657
For heaven's sake, not those rumors again.

14:44.684 --> 14:46.755
I assure you, I'm not gay.

14:46.786 --> 14:49.062
- I believe her.
- Thank you.

14:49.088 --> 14:51.728
It's not just because
you're flirting with me,

14:51.758 --> 14:55.501
it's the way that you’re flirting.
It's very subtle.

14:55.528 --> 14:57.701
So, now we've established that I'm straight.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.801
I still could have had a fling with Ilana.

14:59.832 --> 15:02.540
When you were 15?

15:03.970 --> 15:06.678
I'll confess to a schoolgirl crush on Ilana.

15:06.706 --> 15:08.515
We held hands, we kissed a little.

15:08.541 --> 15:10.885
That's as far as it went,
and it lasted all of two weeks.

15:10.910 --> 15:13.823
Did that include joy riding
in the headmaster's car?

15:13.846 --> 15:16.383
That wasn't me. I wish it was.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.896
Sounded like Ilana and that
other girl had a lot of fun.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.831
Eames: You know who the other girl was?

15:21.854 --> 15:24.528
No, I just remember seeing

15:24.557 --> 15:27.401
our local sheriff drop Ilana off
at school early the next morning.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.998
Man: Miss Llewellyn? If you'll excuse me.

15:31.464 --> 15:34.843
I wonder if the local sheriff
remembers it the way she does?

15:38.538 --> 15:42.384
The Chase Academy? It was always one
thing or another with those kids.

15:42.408 --> 15:44.649
They closed the place down, you know.

15:44.677 --> 15:48.147
We know. This was on a Friday
night in November, '78.

15:48.181 --> 15:50.354
One of the girls was Russian-- Ilana Yushka.

15:51.884 --> 15:53.921
A Russian accent?

15:53.953 --> 15:56.297
I vaguely remember her.

15:56.322 --> 15:59.098
If you say her name was Ilana
Yushka, I'll take your word for it.

15:59.125 --> 16:01.196
Eames: What about the other girl?

16:01.227 --> 16:02.968
I don't remember there being another girl.

16:02.995 --> 16:05.601
That's a nice watch.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.941
Thanks. I'm sorry I can't
help you out on that.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.106
You keep rubbing it. Is that a Rolex?

16:10.136 --> 16:12.275
Yeah.

16:13.272 --> 16:15.878
Okay, well, it was nice talking to you.

16:15.908 --> 16:18.388
Oop-- it's loose! Don't let it fall off!

16:20.179 --> 16:24.025
It's a Rolex Gold Shell.

16:24.050 --> 16:27.862
You see, it's got a little higher
profile than other models.

16:27.887 --> 16:31.391
Somebody must like you a lot,
Sheriff, to give you a gold watch.

16:31.424 --> 16:35.236
The boys got it for me
for the years of service.

16:35.261 --> 16:37.537
They gave it to you brand new?

16:37.563 --> 16:39.975
Well, yeah. A couple of years ago.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.138
Really?

16:44.103 --> 16:46.242
This is a vintage watch.

16:46.272 --> 16:48.548
You see, they stopped making it in 1979.

16:48.574 --> 16:50.645
Another thing you should know is...

16:50.676 --> 16:53.589
Rolex never made your watch in solid gold...

16:55.214 --> 17:00.061
No matter what they told you, 20 years ago.

17:03.189 --> 17:05.669
Ilana Yushka's been murdered.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.796
What happened that night

17:07.827 --> 17:10.364
might have something to do with it.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.872
The other girl, what happened to her?

17:17.036 --> 17:20.017
The Russian girl, she didn't
want her folks to find out.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.280
But the other one, soon as I
brought them in, she made a call.

17:22.308 --> 17:27.382
20 minutes later this lawyer
from Bedford, Chester Barrows,

17:27.413 --> 17:30.860
comes in to collect her
on behalf of her parents.

17:30.883 --> 17:33.386
He convinced you to leave her name out
of the report in exchange for a watch?

17:33.419 --> 17:37.390
Well, it wasn't exactly
the crime of the century.

17:37.423 --> 17:39.960
Strick. Her name was Martha Strick.

17:41.928 --> 17:45.899
- Did she show you ID?
- No, but Barrows said that's who she was.

17:45.932 --> 17:47.707
( phone rings )

17:47.733 --> 17:49.872
Excuse me.

17:55.207 --> 17:59.417
Martha Strick was supposed to be at
school 3,000 miles away in Switzerland.

17:59.445 --> 18:01.516
Maybe she was.

18:01.547 --> 18:04.824
Ken Strick doesn't have any
other siblings. I know.

18:04.850 --> 18:07.023
Family sends a lawyer
out in the middle of the night,

18:07.053 --> 18:10.694
they bribe a sheriff, to cover up what?

18:10.723 --> 18:14.227
Little Kenny in a dress.

18:17.530 --> 18:19.874
Kenny: The Chase angle is a smokescreen.

18:19.899 --> 18:22.709
The police are afraid of the Russian mob.

18:22.735 --> 18:24.806
And apparently so is "The Ledger."

18:24.837 --> 18:26.976
That's not fair, Kenneth.

18:27.006 --> 18:29.452
We ran a piece the day
after Ilana was murdered.

18:29.475 --> 18:31.819
It was a trademark Russian mob hit.

18:31.844 --> 18:34.916
Ilana told me she was thinking of
doing a follow-up to her first book.

18:34.947 --> 18:39.896
So why is the NYPD steering the
investigation away from the Russians?

18:39.919 --> 18:42.593
Ilana was your friend and mine,
but that shouldn't influence you.

18:42.622 --> 18:45.831
Neither should the fact that Strick Realty
is one of your biggest advertisers.

18:45.858 --> 18:47.997
But George,

18:48.027 --> 18:50.268
shouldn't someone be asking these questions?

18:53.899 --> 18:56.038
Excuse me.

19:00.039 --> 19:01.882
Man: I wouldn't have brought them here, sir.

19:01.907 --> 19:04.114
But the flight from Toronto got in early.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.214
Drive them around for an hour,
then meet me there.

19:16.455 --> 19:18.628
The male suspect who cut off

19:18.658 --> 19:20.968
Ilana Yushka's head with one blow

19:20.993 --> 19:24.406
and the woman who left the package
at the Chinese restaurant?

19:24.430 --> 19:26.341
Kenneth Strick, one and the same.

19:26.365 --> 19:28.208
That's a hell of a theory.

19:28.234 --> 19:31.238
Is cross-dressing something
people kill for these days?

19:32.371 --> 19:36.342
Transvestitism could be a symptom
of deeper pathology.

19:36.375 --> 19:38.787
I don't know what drives Ken Strick,

19:38.811 --> 19:40.882
but we should find out.

19:40.913 --> 19:43.359
There’s a deeper secret here

19:43.382 --> 19:46.022
and that's probably what
Ilana was writing about.

19:46.052 --> 19:48.532
It'll take more than psychological gleanings

19:48.554 --> 19:51.091
to get a search warrant for a blonde wig

19:51.123 --> 19:53.433
and size 14 dress. Have you
read today's "Ledger"?

19:53.459 --> 19:56.030
Since when do we pay attention to bad press?

19:56.062 --> 19:59.066
The article quotes an "unnamed close friend"

19:59.098 --> 20:01.635
who says Ms. Yushka was planning a follow-up

20:01.667 --> 20:04.273
to her first book and feared for her safety.

20:04.303 --> 20:06.249
The same close friend

20:06.272 --> 20:10.220
who probably manipulates the media.

20:10.242 --> 20:12.552
Ken Strick...

20:12.578 --> 20:15.821
He went to school with the
publisher of "The Ledger."

20:15.848 --> 20:21.093
Detective-- I guess we're not
getting our search warrant?

20:21.120 --> 20:23.896
Not based on a 20-year-old joy ride

20:23.923 --> 20:26.995
and not until you can tell me with certainty

20:27.026 --> 20:30.701
that Martha Strick was not
in that car with Ms. Yushka.

20:34.433 --> 20:37.073
Well, of course it wasn't me.
I wasn't even in the country.

20:37.103 --> 20:40.209
You can contact Le Roset.
They keep excellent records.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.480
I only came home for the summer holidays.

20:42.508 --> 20:44.647
Must have been rough on you.

20:44.677 --> 20:47.453
Didn't you miss your parents?

20:47.480 --> 20:51.428
Our mother had passed away.
There was only our stepfather.

20:51.450 --> 20:53.452
Anyway, Kenny would come
visit during Christmas.

20:53.486 --> 20:55.727
What about Kenny? He ever get into trouble

20:55.755 --> 20:57.428
with the police when he was at Chase?

20:57.456 --> 20:59.060
No.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.594
I really don't understand your fascination

21:01.627 --> 21:04.267
with ancient history.
Don't you people read the paper?

21:04.296 --> 21:08.108
Eames: That phony article your brother
cooked up with his buddy George Tate?

21:08.134 --> 21:10.273
I resent that.

21:10.302 --> 21:12.748
My brother doesn't abuse
his relationships.

21:12.772 --> 21:15.981
Instead of giving anonymous
quotes to the newspaper,

21:16.008 --> 21:18.716
he should have had the guts to talk to us.

21:18.744 --> 21:21.588
What my brother did took guts
and he paid for it.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.685
Eames: Paid for it?

21:23.716 --> 21:25.718
I think you should leave now.

21:29.455 --> 21:31.731
Is he wearing only one boot?

21:31.757 --> 21:33.896
Why would you say that?

21:33.926 --> 21:39.467
Well, because there's only
one lonely boot here.

21:42.434 --> 21:46.507
Is there a reason he's not... wearing it?

21:48.140 --> 21:50.211
Did something happen to his leg?

21:50.242 --> 21:53.314
Eames: Is that what you
meant by "paying for it"?

21:54.446 --> 21:56.585
He came home late last night.

21:56.615 --> 21:59.391
He was limping. He said he'd been mugged.

21:59.418 --> 22:02.524
I wanted to call the police but
he said no and then I understood.

22:02.555 --> 22:04.034
What’s that?

22:04.056 --> 22:06.696
The people who killed Ilana--

22:06.725 --> 22:09.672
they found out Kenny talked
to the newspaper.

22:15.267 --> 22:17.679
My sister has a vivid imagination.

22:17.703 --> 22:20.411
Some thug took my wallet, pushed me down

22:20.439 --> 22:22.350
and that's how I sprained my ankle.

22:22.374 --> 22:24.911
So you didn't get "worked over"
by the Russian mob?

22:24.944 --> 22:27.584
I've said everything I have to say.

22:27.613 --> 22:30.116
You say one thing to us, you say
another thing to the newspapers.

22:30.149 --> 22:33.358
I didn't talk to the papers.
That's pure conjecture on Martha's part.

22:33.385 --> 22:35.524
Don't put it on your sister.

22:39.124 --> 22:41.331
It's you.

22:41.360 --> 22:44.034
You're the one that's trying to
steer it towards the Russians.

22:44.063 --> 22:47.510
I'd be a fool to try.

22:47.533 --> 22:49.740
You steer it wherever you want, Detective.

22:49.768 --> 22:53.215
Okay. Do you know a Chester Barrows?

22:53.239 --> 22:55.776
No.

22:55.808 --> 22:59.153
He was a lawyer in Bedford.
Your stepfather hired him in 1978?

22:59.178 --> 23:02.318
I wouldn't know.

23:02.348 --> 23:05.454
The sheriff in Adler Township

23:05.484 --> 23:09.364
said that Mr. Barrows showed up
the night of November 12th

23:09.388 --> 23:14.098
and bailed out someone
named "Martha Strick."

23:15.294 --> 23:18.002
I doubt that very much.

23:18.030 --> 23:21.477
- Because Martha was away in Switzerland?
- She most certainly was.

23:21.500 --> 23:24.572
And you were fast asleep in
your room at the Chase Academy?

23:24.603 --> 23:27.015
I most certainly was.

23:31.443 --> 23:33.582
What?

23:33.612 --> 23:39.028
Well, it's just what I thought.
You pluck your eyebrows.

24:10.382 --> 24:13.226
Did you tell Kenneth Strick
he plucks his eyebrows?

24:13.252 --> 24:15.254
Yes.

24:15.287 --> 24:17.733
He does, right?

24:18.724 --> 24:20.863
He complained to the mayor.

24:20.893 --> 24:24.739
Now the Chief of Detectives
wants this turned over to the FBI.

24:24.763 --> 24:27.039
It's not a mob case.

24:27.066 --> 24:29.307
They planned a hit on Ilana Yushka.

24:29.335 --> 24:31.372
They put a beat-down on Kenneth Strick.

24:31.403 --> 24:34.475
When the Russians put
a beat-down on someone, it shows.

24:34.506 --> 24:36.645
Strick didn't have a mark
on his face or his hands.

24:36.675 --> 24:39.679
So what's he doing limping
around with a cane?

24:39.712 --> 24:41.851
Strick is a straight guy

24:41.880 --> 24:44.417
who can only get excited
wearing women's clothing.

24:45.417 --> 24:48.694
That usually goes hand in hand with masochism.

24:48.721 --> 24:51.565
I learn something new every day.

24:51.590 --> 24:55.163
A guy like Strick probably hires
a pro to give him a workout.

24:55.194 --> 24:58.038
Here, on his Amex bill.
A couple of days before he was injured

24:58.063 --> 25:02.102
Strick bought two tickets on Air
Canada from Toronto to New York.

25:02.134 --> 25:05.274
Maybe he hired out-of-town talent?

25:09.441 --> 25:12.285
Okay, so now it's a big crime
to go down to the States?

25:12.311 --> 25:14.814
The Free Trade Act doesn't
actually allow prostitutes

25:14.847 --> 25:16.884
to cross the border to ply their trade.

25:16.915 --> 25:20.192
It's still a felony that
you can get extradited for

25:20.219 --> 25:22.358
and your government won't lift
a finger to help you.

25:22.388 --> 25:24.493
He's right about that, missy.

25:24.523 --> 25:27.561
Better answer their questions
and be smart about it.

25:27.593 --> 25:29.869
So, okay.

25:29.895 --> 25:32.933
My girlfriend and me
went down to New York for work.

25:34.400 --> 25:37.142
That's the guy.

25:38.270 --> 25:41.376
And how did these sessions with him play out?

25:42.741 --> 25:45.654
He likes being made
to dress up in women's clothes.

25:45.677 --> 25:48.123
The whole kit,

25:48.147 --> 25:50.286
from high heels to a wig and make-up.

25:50.315 --> 25:52.522
Then what did you do?

25:53.719 --> 25:55.630
( loud clap )

25:55.654 --> 25:59.101
Did you smack him... hard?

25:59.124 --> 26:02.037
Yes. He likes being smacked around.

26:02.061 --> 26:04.473
You got carried away the last time?

26:05.798 --> 26:10.269
I stepped on his foot by mistake,
but he didn't mind much.

26:10.302 --> 26:12.942
The words. The words--

26:12.971 --> 26:15.315
what were the words he had you say
to him while this was going on?

26:15.340 --> 26:18.219
We had to call him "Kenny"
and tell him he's a bad boy

26:18.243 --> 26:20.382
who's getting what he deserves.

26:20.412 --> 26:23.950
What were the words that he used?
The exact words. It's important.

26:26.351 --> 26:28.422
"I didn't mean it.

26:28.454 --> 26:32.095
I'm sorry, Mommy. Don't go away, Mommy."

26:32.124 --> 26:34.627
- Like that.
- Eames: Then what?

26:34.660 --> 26:38.972
Well, after he got smacked around good,
he was ready for the big finish,

26:38.997 --> 26:41.307
so we took care of that
and went back to the hotel.

26:41.333 --> 26:43.472
Is there a computer I can use?

26:43.502 --> 26:45.846
Attorney: Sure. The officer will show you.

26:46.839 --> 26:48.978
Thank you.

26:52.177 --> 26:54.919
- You're being silly.
- You were gone for an hour.

26:54.947 --> 26:57.086
Joshua it's just a bit of fun.

26:57.116 --> 26:58.891
And really, Kenny, do I question you

26:58.917 --> 27:01.955
when you disappear to
God-knows-where with God-knows-who?

27:01.987 --> 27:04.194
Don't change the subject.

27:04.223 --> 27:06.669
The subject is loyalty-- and truthfulness.

27:06.692 --> 27:08.865
I had to find out from the police
you dragged my name

27:08.894 --> 27:10.931
into some adolescent criminal prank.

27:10.963 --> 27:13.534
I told you, it was Ilana.
She's the one who used your name.

27:13.565 --> 27:17.103
I don't know, Kenny. I have to wonder
what other secrets you keep from me.

27:17.136 --> 27:19.275
( screams )
You're not being fair!

27:20.706 --> 27:23.312
I'm going to bed now.

27:23.342 --> 27:26.653
Martha, I'm sorry. Please
don't go to sleep angry.

27:27.913 --> 27:31.019
I swear I'm not hiding anything.

27:33.252 --> 27:36.028
Please say something, Martha.

27:36.054 --> 27:38.364
I need you to trust me.

27:38.390 --> 27:41.894
Martha?

27:44.863 --> 27:47.002
( tearfully )
I'm sorry.

27:49.868 --> 27:53.509
Martha, please, I didn't mean it.

27:57.776 --> 28:00.188
( whimpers )
Don't be mad at me.

28:01.113 --> 28:04.492
I'm not.

28:07.286 --> 28:09.960
I can never stay mad at you--

28:09.988 --> 28:12.127
not my big brother.

28:19.231 --> 28:22.303
The girl said Strick paid her
and her friend $5 grand each.

28:22.334 --> 28:25.713
And here I thought hockey players and maple
syrup were Canada's biggest exports.

28:25.737 --> 28:28.877
His mother, Eloise Strick, died in 1974.

28:28.907 --> 28:31.046
A suicide in the kitchen of the family home.

28:31.076 --> 28:33.147
From eating ant poison.

28:33.178 --> 28:36.785
The only witness was her
10-year-old son, Kenneth.

28:41.987 --> 28:44.991
Eloise Strick, death by suicide,

28:45.023 --> 28:47.299
August 1974. Here you go.

28:48.327 --> 28:50.466
Where's the rest of it?

28:50.495 --> 28:53.305
30-year-old file. It happens.

28:54.333 --> 28:57.041
Anyone check out this file recently?

28:57.069 --> 29:00.915
No. There was a reporter asking
for it a couple of weeks ago.

29:00.939 --> 29:03.078
I told her she'd have
to file an application.

29:03.108 --> 29:06.248
This her? Russian accent?

29:06.278 --> 29:08.315
Yes.

29:08.347 --> 29:11.191
What about the lead detective
on the case, Alan Forbes?

29:11.216 --> 29:14.254
You didn't misplace him, did you?

29:15.254 --> 29:18.201
Alan passed away three years ago.

29:18.223 --> 29:20.328
And John Nemetz, what happened to him?

29:20.359 --> 29:22.498
Who?

29:22.527 --> 29:24.529
The crime scene photographer.

29:28.267 --> 29:32.044
We're looking for photos
of a suicide-- Eloise Strick, 1974.

29:32.070 --> 29:35.847
That would be under
"Famous people suicides."

29:35.874 --> 29:38.013
Of course, the family wasn't famous then.

29:38.043 --> 29:43.117
Mr. Strick just started
his real estate business.

29:57.629 --> 29:59.870
That's the glass that had the ant poison.

29:59.898 --> 30:01.900
She took it with lemonade.

30:01.933 --> 30:03.776
Her son was the only witness?

30:03.802 --> 30:05.975
Yeah.

30:06.004 --> 30:09.884
The nanny-- Miss Mendoza,
something like that--

30:09.908 --> 30:12.184
she'd gone to the store with the daughter.

30:12.210 --> 30:13.883
The stepfather was out of town on business.

30:13.912 --> 30:16.518
Poor little kid. You see that cupboard there?

30:16.548 --> 30:18.391
That's where we found him.

30:18.417 --> 30:21.660
When the mother started dying
from the poison, he ran in there.

30:21.687 --> 30:23.826
I can't imagine what that
poor kid went through,

30:23.855 --> 30:25.926
seeing his mother go like that.

30:27.326 --> 30:30.170
Goren: Do you have a magnifying glass?

30:38.437 --> 30:40.747
In the dining room,

30:40.772 --> 30:43.582
there's a big box of soda
crackers open on the table.

30:43.608 --> 30:45.645
Was somebody eating there?

30:45.677 --> 30:49.022
The boy said Mrs. Strick was
before she took the poison.

30:51.583 --> 30:54.291
Eating soda crackers
on a hot summer morning?

30:54.319 --> 30:57.892
Morning sickness.

30:57.923 --> 30:59.960
That's right. That came out in the autopsy.

30:59.991 --> 31:02.130
She was two months pregnant.

31:08.667 --> 31:10.908
The people who bought this place
aren't going to be thrilled

31:10.936 --> 31:13.177
to hear what happened here.

31:13.205 --> 31:15.344
May I help you?

31:15.374 --> 31:17.854
Good afternoon, ma'am. New York City Police.

31:17.876 --> 31:20.254
We're investigating an incident

31:20.278 --> 31:22.485
involving one the previous
owners of this house.

31:22.514 --> 31:26.462
What previous owner? I've been
living here for almost 25 years.

31:26.485 --> 31:28.931
The incident occurred in 1974.

31:28.954 --> 31:31.867
I don't know anything about that. Sorry.

31:31.890 --> 31:34.530
We'd just like to take a look at the kitchen.

31:34.559 --> 31:36.698
No, you can't go in.

31:36.728 --> 31:40.266
- It's Mrs. Mendoza, right?
- Mendez.

31:40.298 --> 31:42.437
You were the nanny for
the Strick kids? Yes.

31:42.467 --> 31:44.538
You bought the house
from them?

31:44.569 --> 31:47.641
No. They kept it in the family.
I just lease it from them.

31:47.672 --> 31:49.811
It's a tragedy what happened to Mrs. Strick.

31:49.841 --> 31:51.582
I can't imagine how those poor kids felt,

31:51.610 --> 31:54.386
losing their mother and maybe
a little brother or sister.

31:54.413 --> 31:56.620
Oh, no. They didn't know

31:56.648 --> 31:59.128
Mrs. Strick was going to have a baby.
She hadn't told them.

31:59.151 --> 32:01.153
Why's that?

32:01.186 --> 32:04.497
I don't know. She just told me she
didn't want them to know yet.

32:07.092 --> 32:10.596
I'm sorry. At the funeral,
how did the children behave?

32:10.629 --> 32:12.768
Oh, Mr. Kenny,

32:12.798 --> 32:16.541
he was very brave, like a little man.

32:16.568 --> 32:20.641
He stood up very straight,
holding his sister's hand.

32:20.672 --> 32:24.620
What did Martha do? She broke my heart.

32:24.643 --> 32:28.284
She put her favorite teddy bear

32:28.313 --> 32:30.418
in Mrs. Strick's coffin,

32:30.449 --> 32:33.396
so Mrs. Strick "wouldn't
be afraid of the dark."

32:33.418 --> 32:37.127
Has anyone been around
recently asking questions?

32:37.155 --> 32:41.035
You mean snooping? Yeah.
There was this lady--

32:41.059 --> 32:45.166
She parked the car across the house
and she was taking pictures.

32:45.197 --> 32:47.575
- A blonde lady?
- Yeah.

32:47.599 --> 32:49.237
I hope you told Mr. Strick about it.

32:49.267 --> 32:52.680
- Oh yeah, I did.
- Goren: Good for you.

32:52.704 --> 32:55.082
Thanks.

34:02.741 --> 34:04.914
We need a search warrant
for the suicide house.

34:04.943 --> 34:07.082
Search for what?

34:07.112 --> 34:09.353
Motive.

34:10.849 --> 34:13.125
I don't see where it specifies
what you're looking for.

34:13.150 --> 34:15.995
Right there. Cutting instruments, lye.

34:16.021 --> 34:17.967
But why that house?

34:17.989 --> 34:21.027
I only came to inform you
of the warrant as a courtesy,

34:21.059 --> 34:23.402
to give your representatives

34:23.428 --> 34:25.668
an opportunity to be
present during the search.

34:25.697 --> 34:28.074
It's Saturday. Contrary to what you may think,

34:28.099 --> 34:30.237
I don't have lawyers standing by on call.

34:30.268 --> 34:32.612
Either of you is welcome to observe.

34:32.637 --> 34:34.775
They're not entitled to be there.

34:34.806 --> 34:36.945
Why are we kowtowing to these people?

34:36.975 --> 34:38.386
Carver: Detectives, please.

34:38.409 --> 34:40.356
Does this search have to be done today?

34:40.378 --> 34:43.824
Yes. It doesn't matter anyway.
The older lady's there every day.

34:43.848 --> 34:46.192
Mrs. Mendez? Has she been told you're coming?

34:46.217 --> 34:48.356
Eames: Shell find out when we get there.

34:48.386 --> 34:50.831
I have to go. She's by herself.
She'll be very upset.

34:50.855 --> 34:52.926
We're not going back there.

34:52.958 --> 34:56.167
I'll be fine. You stay here.

34:56.194 --> 34:58.231
I'll go, Mr. Carver.

34:58.263 --> 35:00.334
Goren: Fine, just her. Let's go.

35:00.365 --> 35:02.402
I'm going with you.

35:04.469 --> 35:06.881
We can't all fit in our vehicle.

35:06.905 --> 35:09.442
Miss Strick can ride with me.

35:16.948 --> 35:19.019
What we're interested in is in here.

35:19.050 --> 35:21.929
This place is like a time capsule.

35:24.522 --> 35:27.765
Same fridge ...
same stove ...

35:27.792 --> 35:29.794
Same floor, right?

35:32.063 --> 35:34.202
Well...

35:36.201 --> 35:39.307
Two hours you were hiding in there?

35:39.337 --> 35:41.476
You must have been terrified.

35:43.041 --> 35:45.180
I'll wait for Martha outside.

35:46.211 --> 35:48.350
Terrified they'd find out.

35:50.615 --> 35:54.427
We found duplicate photos
of the crime scene.

35:54.452 --> 35:58.195
"Crime scene," because that's
what went on in this kitchen.

35:58.223 --> 36:00.931
I'm warning you, Detective,
stop this right now.

36:00.959 --> 36:04.930
Your mother, sitting there...

36:10.101 --> 36:13.344
...eating crackers to settle her stomach.

36:13.371 --> 36:16.045
She had morning sickness.

36:16.074 --> 36:19.021
She was pregnant by your stepfather.

36:19.044 --> 36:21.320
You didn't like that?

36:21.346 --> 36:24.225
You were scared your mother
wouldn't love you anymore.

36:24.249 --> 36:27.230
That's not true.

36:27.252 --> 36:29.698
We didn't know she was pregnant.
She didn't tell us.

36:29.721 --> 36:33.134
Martha knew. She put her
teddy bear in the coffin.

36:33.158 --> 36:35.365
Not for your mother, for the baby.

36:38.163 --> 36:40.609
Martha was probably excited about the baby.

36:40.632 --> 36:44.136
But you--

36:45.270 --> 36:49.741
you wanted it to go away...

36:50.742 --> 36:55.418
Just a little bit.
"if Mommy only got sick, just a little bit."

36:55.447 --> 36:58.553
Just enough to throw up
the baby from her stomach.

36:58.583 --> 37:00.688
No, no, no.

37:00.719 --> 37:04.132
Your mother was thirsty,

37:04.155 --> 37:07.466
from-- from the crackers.

37:07.492 --> 37:10.735
She asked you to bring her a lemonade.

37:12.964 --> 37:15.945
You poured the glass there.

37:15.967 --> 37:18.470
You--

37:18.503 --> 37:20.983
you mixed in the ant poison.

37:21.973 --> 37:25.352
Spilled some on the floor.

37:25.376 --> 37:28.619
The bitterness from the lemonade--

37:28.646 --> 37:31.252
it masked the taste.

37:33.518 --> 37:37.193
Almost right away she started getting sick.

37:40.792 --> 37:43.432
And she took one look at you and she knew.

37:43.461 --> 37:46.271
- No--
- She came at you.

37:51.436 --> 37:54.849
The glass fell out of her hand-- there.

37:56.908 --> 37:59.855
And you backed away.

38:02.180 --> 38:04.558
"I didn't mean it, Mommy.

38:04.582 --> 38:07.290
I'm sorry, Mommy."

38:08.987 --> 38:11.126
And she collapsed.

38:18.296 --> 38:21.766
She reached out her hand for you.

38:22.767 --> 38:25.646
You hid in the cupboard.

38:29.574 --> 38:31.986
Your mother died.

38:33.912 --> 38:37.018
And no one ever knew the truth.

38:37.048 --> 38:39.722
No one except your partner
in crime at Chase,

38:39.751 --> 38:44.564
Goren: Ilana, who you shared
your most shameful secret with.

38:44.589 --> 38:48.059
20 years later...

38:48.092 --> 38:53.132
Because she became desperate
for money and fame,

38:53.164 --> 38:56.168
she decided to write a book about it.

38:56.201 --> 38:58.772
You couldn't let that happen.

38:58.803 --> 39:01.647
Never mind the whole world finding out

39:01.673 --> 39:05.951
what a sad, misguided
little boy did to his mother,

39:05.977 --> 39:09.720
you couldn't let Martha find out.

39:09.747 --> 39:13.456
The one person who looks up to you--

39:13.484 --> 39:15.930
who loves you...

39:17.422 --> 39:20.960
Whose hand you held at your mother's funeral.

39:28.666 --> 39:31.078
The only family you have.

39:32.403 --> 39:36.681
You-- you couldn't afford to lose her.

39:38.776 --> 39:41.222
And that's why you killed Ilana!

39:41.246 --> 39:43.726
( stammers )
You're-- you're wrong.

39:44.716 --> 39:47.925
This is all an incredible web of lies.

39:50.989 --> 39:54.835
Kenny, you're running out of time.

39:57.161 --> 39:59.198
When Martha gets here,

39:59.230 --> 40:03.337
she's going to learn why you
killed Ilana. The truth.

40:03.368 --> 40:06.440
She'll never believe it.

40:09.340 --> 40:11.843
Or...

40:15.013 --> 40:18.119
A convenient fiction?

40:19.884 --> 40:23.991
Like, Ilana was writing

40:24.022 --> 40:27.265
a scathing exposé

40:27.292 --> 40:29.533
of Eloise Strick,

40:29.560 --> 40:33.133
the selfish, unstable divorcée

40:33.164 --> 40:35.576
who cared so little for her children

40:35.600 --> 40:39.571
she committed suicide
in front of her only son...

40:40.805 --> 40:42.944
Scarring him for life.

40:42.974 --> 40:46.114
And you...

40:46.144 --> 40:49.887
Became enraged by what this
book could do to your family,

40:49.914 --> 40:53.828
so you did what was necessary to stop it.

40:56.854 --> 40:58.993
( door opens )

41:01.359 --> 41:05.569
Truth... fiction.

41:10.835 --> 41:12.815
Kenneth?

41:12.837 --> 41:15.681
Carver: I'm sorry about the delay.

41:15.707 --> 41:17.744
I took the wrong turn off the LIE.

41:23.581 --> 41:26.790
Are they finished?

41:26.818 --> 41:32.200
We just having a long talk
with Kenneth about Ilana Yushka.

41:35.560 --> 41:37.870
We also talked to him

41:37.895 --> 41:40.034
about your mother--

41:45.770 --> 41:48.876
her-- her tragic death.

41:48.906 --> 41:51.045
Martha, I told them I killed Ilana.

41:54.012 --> 41:56.822
Oh, my God, Kenny!

41:59.217 --> 42:01.788
She...

42:01.819 --> 42:05.596
Was writing a book about Mother--

42:05.623 --> 42:09.230
a book of lies and distortions.

42:09.260 --> 42:11.900
I tried to reason with her,

42:11.929 --> 42:15.900
but couldn't talk her-- talk her out of it.

42:15.933 --> 42:19.107
I kept thinking of you.

42:22.940 --> 42:24.886
I don't know what came over me.

42:24.909 --> 42:28.220
I-- I killed her.

42:29.247 --> 42:31.488
I'm so sorry.

42:36.120 --> 42:38.532
It'll be all right, Kenny.

42:50.768 --> 42:54.215
( softly )
I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it to happen.

43:10.455 --> 43:12.628
I'll get the best lawyer, Kenny.

43:12.657 --> 43:15.069
I'll take care of everything.

43:22.700 --> 43:25.203
Thank you.

43:36.981 --> 43:40.360
( theme music playing )

43:41.305 --> 43:47.659
