<i>Previously on "Heartland":</i>

00:01.983 --> 00:03.316
I got these in the mail
this week.

00:03.384 --> 00:04.751
You got accepted
at two places.

00:04.819 --> 00:06.219
Grasslands
Agricultural College

00:06.287 --> 00:07.654
and University of Manitoba.

00:07.721 --> 00:10.056
I'm telling you
that I'm moving away;

00:10.123 --> 00:11.490
That we won't be
working together,

00:11.558 --> 00:12.692
that I won't get to see you
every morning,

00:12.759 --> 00:15.494
that we can't be
together.

00:17.497 --> 00:18.698
That's not so easy.

00:18.765 --> 00:20.332
If you can give up on us
working together

00:20.400 --> 00:22.234
after one day,

00:22.302 --> 00:23.669
what happens if we...

00:23.736 --> 00:24.703
What? If we what?

00:24.770 --> 00:26.004
I don't know,
if we...

00:26.072 --> 00:28.807
Live together...
Or something.

00:28.874 --> 00:30.341
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>You know what?</i>

00:30.409 --> 00:33.878
I don't ever want things
to change.

00:34.847 --> 00:37.615
That doesn't sound
like you at all.

00:37.683 --> 00:38.750
(Laughing)

00:42.521 --> 00:44.922

(Door thunks shut)

01:02.172 --> 01:03.240
(Contented sigh)

01:04.941 --> 01:07.009
(Tailgate clicks open)

01:07.945 --> 01:10.347
(Birds chirp)

01:12.216 --> 01:14.750
(Easel legs snap into place)

(Birds sing)

01:43.445 --> 01:45.845
(Water babbles gently)

01:48.883 --> 01:50.684
I tacked up the horses.

01:50.752 --> 01:52.319
I thought we could go
for a ride.

01:55.990 --> 01:58.792
Well, getting a head start
on the packing?

01:58.859 --> 02:00.059
Yeah.
I've got to.

02:00.127 --> 02:01.960
I'm working
with Scott today so...

02:02.028 --> 02:03.496
I'm not going to see you
until Thanksgiving?

02:03.563 --> 02:05.898
And you're spending
your last day with Scott?

02:05.965 --> 02:07.767
Hey,
I thought we said

02:07.834 --> 02:08.934
we weren't gonna make
a big deal

02:09.002 --> 02:10.102
about this being
my last day.

02:10.169 --> 02:12.237
Well, that was before
you started packing.

02:15.342 --> 02:17.275
You know I hate
long goodbyes.

02:17.343 --> 02:18.576
I'd rather not even go-

02:18.644 --> 02:21.379
Okay, Ty. Let's not talk
about school, okay?

02:21.447 --> 02:23.515
Don't say you're not going,
not because of me.

02:23.582 --> 02:25.149
Drive me nuts.

02:28.887 --> 02:30.922
What if I told you
I was gonna miss you?

02:30.989 --> 02:32.156
Would that drive
you nuts?

02:32.224 --> 02:33.791
Mm-mm.

02:33.858 --> 02:36.393
You can tell me
you'll miss me.

02:36.461 --> 02:38.829
But just a little,
and just this once, okay?

02:38.896 --> 02:39.963
Okay.

02:40.932 --> 02:42.433
(Camera clicks)

02:42.500 --> 02:44.368
Mallory!
What're you doing?

02:44.436 --> 02:45.836
Nothing!
You'll thank me later.

02:48.706 --> 02:50.105
You know,
there's some other things

02:50.173 --> 02:52.875
I'm gonna miss
about this place, too.

02:52.943 --> 02:54.777
Like this guy.

02:54.845 --> 02:57.714
Hey Harley?
How you doin'?

02:57.781 --> 02:59.749
Hey! Where the hell is Caleb?

02:59.817 --> 03:02.752
Who does he think is gonna do
his work? Me?

03:02.820 --> 03:04.386
And some things I'm not.

03:04.454 --> 03:05.520
(Laughing)

03:07.256 --> 03:08.490
Mallory:
Oh, that's perfect!

03:08.558 --> 03:09.591
Hold it right there,
one second.

03:09.659 --> 03:10.592
Mallory!

03:10.660 --> 03:12.427
<i>Give it a rest!</i>

03:12.495 --> 03:13.562
Whatever.

03:18.133 --> 03:19.468
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Okay, so I'm thinking...</i>

03:19.535 --> 03:22.203
Individual size
napoletana pizzas,

03:22.271 --> 03:24.672
and a big Caesar salad.

03:24.740 --> 03:26.474
With lots of anchovies.

03:26.541 --> 03:28.943
Nothing says going away party
like anchovies.

03:29.011 --> 03:30.511
What's that,
Ty's favourite food?

03:30.579 --> 03:31.913
Hm. No, it's mine.

03:31.981 --> 03:34.249
I'm having this
weird craving lately.

03:34.316 --> 03:36.117
Oh my God!
You won't believe this,

03:36.185 --> 03:38.318
but that's exactly
how I found out I was pregnant.

03:38.386 --> 03:39.319
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Really?</i>

03:39.387 --> 03:40.553
Yeah.

03:40.621 --> 03:42.322
Me and Jerry,
we'd been trying for ages.

03:42.390 --> 03:43.757
And one day
we were out for pizza

03:43.824 --> 03:45.492
and instead of ordering
the Hawaiian special,

03:45.559 --> 03:48.128
I ordered the napoletana
with extra anchovies!

03:48.196 --> 03:52.065
And that's when Jerry said,
honey, we must be pregnant!

03:52.133 --> 03:54.233
Because of the anchovies?

03:54.301 --> 03:56.235
That and the forgetfulness.

03:56.303 --> 03:59.238
And when I checked the calendar
I was a whole week late.

03:59.306 --> 04:01.007
Just a week?

04:01.074 --> 04:02.275
By the way,

04:02.342 --> 04:03.442
I'm gonna have
my hands full

04:03.510 --> 04:05.378
shopping for the next
couple of hours.

04:05.445 --> 04:07.513
Maybe you could do me
a little favour?

04:07.580 --> 04:08.647
Sure.

04:11.150 --> 04:13.285
Lou: Oh. Okay. Got it.

04:13.352 --> 04:14.619
All right. See ya.

04:14.686 --> 04:16.788
Don't worry about a thing,
I got him.

04:16.855 --> 04:17.923
Bye.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.495
Don't go anywhere.

04:32.870 --> 04:35.672
One, two, three, four,
five, six...

04:35.740 --> 04:36.807
Yeesh!

04:37.475 --> 04:38.909
Jerry Junior:
(Crying)

04:39.844 --> 04:40.911
Jerry!

04:42.379 --> 04:45.048
(Jerry crying)
Hey, I'm right here.

04:45.983 --> 04:47.783
Don't cry...
Don't cry...

04:49.119 --> 04:50.519
Don't cry.
Yeah!

04:52.356 --> 04:53.756
(Jerry spits up)

04:55.759 --> 04:57.259
Ew!

04:57.327 --> 04:58.593
(Jerry fusses)

04:59.161 --> 05:00.327
Gross!

05:00.596 --> 05:01.897
(Jerry giggles)

05:03.296 --> 05:04.597
Thanks.

05:05.900 --> 05:06.968
Gross.

05:09.105 --> 05:11.173
(Grass crunches underfoot)

05:18.263 --> 05:19.663
Oh no, not again.

05:30.006 --> 05:31.140

06:18.368 --> 06:20.670
Hey Lou,
just wondering...

06:20.738 --> 06:22.772
What time do you want me
to get Ty back?

06:22.840 --> 06:23.873
Ah, five o'clock,

06:23.941 --> 06:25.775
but please
don't be late.

06:25.843 --> 06:28.044
Lou? Is there something
you haven't told me?

06:28.111 --> 06:30.413
Yeah. It's a surprise party,
so please.

06:30.481 --> 06:31.815
No. I mean...

06:32.750 --> 06:34.382
Oh yeah,
this is Jerry Junior,

06:34.451 --> 06:35.717
Marnie's little guy.

06:35.785 --> 06:36.952
I'm babysitting.

06:37.019 --> 06:39.020
Figured. Never saw you
as the baby type.

06:39.088 --> 06:40.556
Uh... excuse me?

06:40.623 --> 06:44.192
I am totally the baby type,
okay? I just...

06:44.260 --> 06:46.428
Here you go.
Yeah...

06:46.496 --> 06:47.563
Uh, (Clears throat)

06:47.630 --> 06:49.431
You're not gonna
test that first?

06:49.498 --> 06:51.732
Oh yeah. Totally.

06:51.800 --> 06:53.033
Mm. Ah!

06:54.436 --> 06:55.503
It's good.

06:55.571 --> 06:57.071
It's just really,
really hot.

06:57.138 --> 07:00.307
That's too hot for you.
Too hot.

07:01.076 --> 07:02.276
Super hot.

07:03.211 --> 07:04.745
Come on, I'm going
to be gone forever.

07:04.813 --> 07:06.412
We can always go riding
when I get back.

07:06.481 --> 07:07.647
Yeah.
Except Lou's probably

07:07.715 --> 07:09.182
gonna wanna have
an early dinner,

07:09.249 --> 07:11.217
and, you know,
make something special...

07:11.285 --> 07:13.687
Hey! Let's go.
See you later, Amy.

07:13.754 --> 07:15.088
See you, Scott.

07:15.155 --> 07:17.190
I thought we said today
wasn't gonna be a big deal.

07:17.257 --> 07:18.391
This better not be
one of Lou's fancy-

07:18.459 --> 07:20.527
It's... no.
It's just dinner, okay?

07:20.595 --> 07:21.894
It's not gonna...

07:21.962 --> 07:25.330
(Scott honks) Okay, okay.
I'm coming.

07:25.398 --> 07:26.098
I'll see you.

07:26.165 --> 07:27.600
Okay. Okay.

07:29.536 --> 07:31.336
(Truck starts up)

07:32.873 --> 07:36.575
(Truck rumbles away)

07:36.643 --> 07:38.843
Wow. The last day...

07:38.911 --> 07:41.546
Not even a goodbye kiss?
Talk about playing it cool.

07:43.081 --> 07:45.149
Mallory, get the camera
outta my face.

07:49.121 --> 07:50.354
<i>Soraya:</i>
<i>She ordered it weeks ago</i>

07:50.422 --> 07:51.389
and keeps "forgetting"
to pick it up.

07:51.456 --> 07:52.657
She's so in denial.

07:52.725 --> 07:53.991
Her latest excuse?

07:54.058 --> 07:54.725
She says she doesn't
wanna go overboard

07:54.792 --> 07:55.526
about him leaving.

07:55.593 --> 07:57.127
Tell me about it.

07:57.194 --> 07:59.229
<i>She keeps saying how okay</i>
<i>she'll be without Ty.</i>

07:59.296 --> 08:00.463
Yeah. How long is that
going to last?

08:00.532 --> 08:01.765
Well,
he's leaving tomorrow,

08:01.833 --> 08:03.800
so I guessing, at least,
one more day.

08:03.868 --> 08:05.201
Caleb: Hey girls.
Girls: Hey.

08:05.269 --> 08:06.637
Aren't you a little late
for work?

08:06.704 --> 08:08.071
Yes I am.

08:08.139 --> 08:09.539
I'm gonna be
a whole lot later, too,

08:09.606 --> 08:12.207
once I polish off one...
ranchman's breakfast special.

08:12.275 --> 08:14.109
Wow.
The ranchman's special.

08:14.177 --> 08:16.512
This is kind of like serving
someone his last meal.

08:16.580 --> 08:17.880
What do you mean?

08:17.948 --> 08:19.281
She means that Jack's
going to kill you.

08:19.349 --> 08:21.250
Yeah,
or give me a raise.

08:21.317 --> 08:22.518
With Ty gone and all,

08:22.586 --> 08:24.654
I figure I'll be doing
twice as much work,

08:24.721 --> 08:26.120
so I deserve twice
as much money.

08:26.188 --> 08:28.023
Please!
Jack is a total cheapskate.

08:28.090 --> 08:29.824
The last of the ten
percent tippers.

08:29.892 --> 08:31.159
Ashley:
You get ten percent?

08:31.226 --> 08:33.160
I still get
Canadian tire money!

08:33.227 --> 08:35.227
Yeah. That's why
I'm changing tactics.

08:35.296 --> 08:36.563
Playing hardball.

08:36.631 --> 08:38.398
Starting off with
being late for work,

08:38.466 --> 08:40.034
Jack's gonna realize
how much he needs me

08:40.101 --> 08:42.135
and have no choice
but to give me that raise.

08:42.203 --> 08:43.336
Ashley:
Yeah. That's a great plan.

08:43.404 --> 08:44.638
Yeah.
Only problem is...

08:44.706 --> 08:47.841
You don't know Jack
about Jack.

08:49.510 --> 08:50.577
(Truck rumbles)

08:55.583 --> 08:58.150
Briar Ridge?
What are they doing here?

08:59.553 --> 09:02.388
Well, I thought you could
use a distraction,

09:02.456 --> 09:06.392
to help keep your mind
off this situation.

09:06.460 --> 09:07.826
You're talking about
with Ty.

09:07.894 --> 09:11.129
Yeah. Well,
something like that.

09:13.032 --> 09:14.600
Hope I'm not late.

09:17.136 --> 09:18.604
<i>Amy:</i> <i>What's seems to be</i>
<i>the problem?</i>

09:18.671 --> 09:19.972
Val: Apollo was bred
for show jumping.

09:20.039 --> 09:21.506
He should be on the circuit.

09:21.574 --> 09:23.373
The problem is Ashley
can't do much with him

09:23.441 --> 09:25.442
ever since he came back
from Heartland.

09:25.510 --> 09:26.911
She says he's jumping
like a camel.

09:26.979 --> 09:28.646
She won't even ride him.

09:28.714 --> 09:30.581
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>He looks good to me.</i>

09:30.649 --> 09:32.750
He's filled out,
he has a nice top line...

09:32.818 --> 09:34.952
<i>Val:</i> <i>Yeah, well,</i>
<i>looks can be deceiving.</i>

09:35.887 --> 09:37.655
I don't know
what you want me to do.

09:38.789 --> 09:40.004
(Chuckles)

09:40.009 --> 09:41.524
You're the horse whisperer.

09:41.525 --> 09:44.393
I think what Val's trying
to say is,

09:44.461 --> 09:47.530
she wants you to make him
more or less like he was.

09:49.934 --> 09:51.001
Well, to tell you
the truth,

09:51.068 --> 09:52.736
I'm not exactly sure
what to expect.

09:52.803 --> 09:53.737
I mean, I haven't been
in a classroom

09:53.804 --> 09:55.004
since grade nine, so...

09:55.071 --> 09:57.139
Don't worry,
the first week is frosh.

09:57.206 --> 09:58.774
(Chuckles)
Frosh.

09:58.842 --> 10:00.509
Another way of saying
free beer.

10:00.576 --> 10:01.944
Yeah. Go easy.

10:02.012 --> 10:03.378
'Cause Monday you'll
wanna have a clear head

10:03.446 --> 10:06.448
before you dissect
your first sheep's brain.

10:06.516 --> 10:07.683
Thanks.

10:07.751 --> 10:08.817
I was really psyched
until you said that.

10:09.853 --> 10:11.352
Ah, you've seen worse.

10:11.419 --> 10:13.187

an assistant here.

<i>I'll do it.</i>
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

10:20.963 --> 10:22.263
Change of plans?

10:22.330 --> 10:24.398
Yeah. I gotta see a woman
about a horse.

10:24.466 --> 10:26.034
In Golden, B.C.?

10:26.251 --> 10:27.851
Isn't that like
300 kilometres from here?

10:27.919 --> 10:29.953
Not as the crow flies.

10:30.021 --> 10:31.087
You're flying in?

10:31.155 --> 10:32.823
Yeah. I'll drop you off
at the ranch

10:32.890 --> 10:33.857
on the way to the airport.

10:33.925 --> 10:35.491
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:35.559 --> 10:37.894
You haven't lost
your assistant yet.

10:37.962 --> 10:39.462
Yeah, but Amy.

10:39.530 --> 10:44.133
I know, it's our last day,
but we're both good with it.

10:44.201 --> 10:46.902
Come on.
A remote vet call?

10:46.970 --> 10:50.873
Okay, but I have to get
you back in time for...

10:50.941 --> 10:54.343
You know,
back in time for supper.

11:02.852 --> 11:03.952
Hey, Jack.

11:04.019 --> 11:05.286
You want me to take over
from here?

11:05.354 --> 11:07.621
I'm glad you finally
decided to show up.

11:07.689 --> 11:09.123
I figured you would be.

11:09.191 --> 11:11.192
That's exactly what I wanted
to talk to you about.

11:11.260 --> 11:13.594
Well, there is something
I wanna say to you too.

11:13.662 --> 11:14.928
The thing is,
with Ty gone and all-

11:14.996 --> 11:16.730
You're fired!

11:16.797 --> 11:17.865
What?

11:20.468 --> 11:21.501
Don't be like that.

11:21.569 --> 11:22.336
I'm just trying
to make a point.

11:22.403 --> 11:23.703
So am I.

11:23.771 --> 11:24.905
Come on, Jack.

11:24.973 --> 11:27.174
I don't need some
rodeo wannabe

11:27.242 --> 11:29.276
with an inflated sense
of his own self worth

11:29.344 --> 11:30.277
working for me.

11:30.345 --> 11:32.478
Pick up your stuff.

11:36.816 --> 11:38.617

on the way out.

a mile away!

Amy:
Look, Mrs. Stanton,

12:21.875 --> 12:23.876
I know you have a lot invested
in this horse,

12:23.943 --> 12:26.345
but if you want me
to do my job,

12:26.413 --> 12:27.547
you're gonna have to...

12:27.614 --> 12:29.014
I'm just trying to help.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.683
Well, see...
That's the thing.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.652
What you're doing is
kind of the opposite of help.

12:33.219 --> 12:34.654
(Phone rings)

12:34.719 --> 12:36.154
Sorry, just...

12:36.322 --> 12:38.557
I have to take this.

12:40.159 --> 12:41.226
Hi.

12:43.095 --> 12:44.396
What?

12:44.463 --> 12:46.264
Ty, on your last day?

12:47.466 --> 12:49.100
No. Whatever.

12:49.168 --> 12:51.368
It just would have been nice
to spend some time together.

12:51.436 --> 12:52.903
Yeah.

12:52.970 --> 12:54.938
Okay. You know what?
I don't care.

12:55.006 --> 12:57.007
Yeah.
Do what you want.

12:58.243 --> 12:59.976
Boyfriend troubles?

13:00.044 --> 13:02.045
No. No troubles.
Just...

13:03.881 --> 13:05.416
I know how you feel.

13:05.483 --> 13:07.084
He's going away to college.

13:07.151 --> 13:08.384
He'll come home
at Thanksgiving

13:08.452 --> 13:10.587
and you'll just be
the old girlfriend.

13:10.654 --> 13:14.023
In my day, they called it
the turkey dump.

13:14.091 --> 13:15.725
You know what?
Um...

13:16.660 --> 13:19.395
I really don't want
that to happen,

13:19.463 --> 13:21.931
so I'm gonna do
something about it.

13:21.998 --> 13:23.532

13:23.600 --> 13:25.066

Scott said I wasn't
the baby type.

14:10.077 --> 14:12.544
I've totally got this
baby thing under control.

14:12.612 --> 14:15.581
Ugh! You need to get that
diaper thing under control.

14:15.649 --> 14:17.549

14:22.889 --> 14:25.924

Jack,
I know you meant well,

15:27.800 --> 15:29.701
but frankly,
I'm put off.

15:29.768 --> 15:32.369
She's just trying to come
to terms with Ty going away

15:32.436 --> 15:33.470
the best she can.

15:33.538 --> 15:35.238
Yeah. Well,
she just took off

15:35.306 --> 15:36.139
and left me
standing there!

15:36.207 --> 15:37.674
She's a young girl,

15:37.742 --> 15:40.010
and long distance
relationships -

15:40.077 --> 15:42.713
well, you know! -
That's not so easy.

15:42.780 --> 15:44.080
Yeah, well,

15:44.148 --> 15:45.916
I guess you're an expert
in that field.

15:45.984 --> 15:47.083

15:47.151 --> 15:48.050
more than she is here,
right?

15:48.118 --> 15:50.486
Well, if I was
such an expert,

15:50.554 --> 15:52.588
maybe she'd stick around
a little bit more.

15:52.656 --> 15:53.856
Listen...

15:53.924 --> 15:57.092
Why don't you leave
this guy with me,

15:57.160 --> 15:59.996
and give Amy
another chance?

16:00.063 --> 16:02.665
Everybody has an off day.

16:11.106 --> 16:12.674

16:12.742 --> 16:14.375
I could have sworn
I put ice.

16:14.443 --> 16:15.577
You're gonna have
to make some.

16:15.645 --> 16:16.845

16:16.913 --> 16:18.079
Come on, what about the thing
for Ty's party.

16:18.147 --> 16:19.514

to do!

16:19.581 --> 16:20.514
You've got a lot of work?

16:20.582 --> 16:21.549
I got the whole party,

16:21.616 --> 16:22.716
plus the ball and chain
here.

16:22.784 --> 16:25.352
You mean the baby?
Nice.

16:26.454 --> 16:28.055
Could you please
just put the beer

16:28.122 --> 16:30.157
in the cooler,
quietly.

16:33.595 --> 16:34.595

while you go get the beer.

16:58.818 --> 17:00.619
No way.

with Jerry Junior.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.223

the ball and chain?

You're right, Lou,
when it come to babies

17:07.060 --> 17:10.895

qualified than me.

Yeah.
Started when I was 30,

18:23.609 --> 18:25.910
picked up
a two-bit oil company.

18:25.978 --> 18:27.545
Gave myself five years
to turn it around

18:27.613 --> 18:29.313
and another five
to take it public and...

18:29.382 --> 18:31.349
It sounds more like
a business plan, baby.

18:31.417 --> 18:32.650
No, no, no.

18:32.718 --> 18:33.751
I've got the personal part
figured out too.

18:33.818 --> 18:35.753
You know,
find a nice girl

18:35.820 --> 18:37.020

of fun,

18:37.088 --> 18:38.989

absolutely crazy!

how pushy that woman can be.

20:03.102 --> 20:04.302
It's not just Val.

20:04.370 --> 20:05.604
And I know it sounds stupid

20:05.672 --> 20:07.339
and I know that Ty's
just gone

20:07.406 --> 20:09.874
for a couple of hours,
but...

20:09.942 --> 20:11.943
It feels like
a big deal to me.

20:12.010 --> 20:13.945
I'm sure it is.

20:14.012 --> 20:15.646
And maybe I wasn't thinking
straight either,

20:15.714 --> 20:17.748
telling Val
that you'd help her.

20:17.816 --> 20:20.217
What with Ty leaving,
I got a lot on my mind, too.

20:21.687 --> 20:23.187
It's okay.

20:23.254 --> 20:25.922
You know, I'll...
I'll give it another shot.

20:25.990 --> 20:28.859
Thanks.
Hey, and uh...

20:28.926 --> 20:33.296
If it doesn't work out,
you let me deal with Val.

20:33.364 --> 20:34.430
Okay.

20:38.669 --> 20:39.569
(Jerry crying)

20:39.637 --> 20:41.371
Oh, is that my little angel?

20:41.438 --> 20:43.138
This is so weird.

20:43.206 --> 20:46.141
He was a little angel
the whole time you were gone.

20:46.209 --> 20:47.643
Oh, don't take it personally,
Lou.

20:47.711 --> 20:48.878
I didn't have
a maternal bone in my body

20:48.945 --> 20:50.345
until Jerry Junior
came along.

20:50.413 --> 20:51.547
You know what,

20:51.615 --> 20:52.815
I think I'm very maternal,
okay?

20:52.883 --> 20:54.016
I cook, I clean.

20:54.083 --> 20:55.684
I look after
this entire family

20:55.752 --> 20:57.052
and I haven't heard
anyone complain...

20:57.120 --> 20:58.620
Except your baby.

20:58.687 --> 21:00.722
Are you saying
it's Jerry Junior's fault?

21:00.789 --> 21:01.923
Because blaming a baby

21:01.991 --> 21:03.190
is pretty much
the least maternal thing

21:03.258 --> 21:04.926
you could do.

21:04.994 --> 21:06.928
Actually, it says on Wikipedia
that guppies eat their young,

21:06.996 --> 21:09.296
so... that's gotta be worse
than blaming.

21:09.364 --> 21:10.965
Mallory, why are you
doing here again?

21:11.033 --> 21:12.033
I need a lift into town.

21:12.100 --> 21:13.067
I need to get a computer cable

21:13.135 --> 21:15.102
for my Goodbye Ty
photo-montage.

21:15.170 --> 21:16.703
Well, we're a little busy,
okay?

21:16.771 --> 21:18.705
Fine! Just don't blame me
if your party sucks

21:18.773 --> 21:20.874
because of a second rate
PowerPoint presentation!

21:24.612 --> 21:25.679
(Exhales)

21:30.484 --> 21:31.751
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Wow!</i>

21:31.818 --> 21:33.920
<i>That's a nice place</i>
<i>you got here.</i>

21:33.987 --> 21:38.024
<i>Scott:</i> <i>No one knows these mountains</i>
<i>better than Jane here does.</i>

21:38.092 --> 21:41.027
<i>Jane:</i> <i>Glad you finally got
your</i> <i>pilot's license, huh?</i>

21:41.095 --> 21:42.628
<i>Maybe we'll be seeing</i>
<i>more of you.</i>

21:42.696 --> 21:44.097
<i>Scott:</i>
<i>That's the idea.</i>

21:48.201 --> 21:50.602
So, one dead horse.

21:51.471 --> 21:54.039
A stallion with an arrow
in his neck?

21:54.107 --> 21:56.741
Jane: And bow-hunting
season just started.

21:56.809 --> 22:00.412
Those guys pay $10,000 a pop
to hunt up here.

22:00.480 --> 22:02.580
They get pretty trigger-happy
if they don't get their elk.

22:02.647 --> 22:03.847
<i>Scott:</i>
<i>This is not the first time</i>

22:03.915 --> 22:05.316
someone's taken a shot
at that herd.

22:05.384 --> 22:07.017
Probably won't be the last.

22:07.086 --> 22:09.720
Yeah, well, a lot of people
wouldn't have noticed or cared.

22:09.788 --> 22:12.256
One wild horse,
more or less.

22:12.924 --> 22:15.159
Make a pretty decent living
painting those horses.

22:15.227 --> 22:16.760
I feel I owe them
for that.

22:21.932 --> 22:24.101
Soraya: Oh! Anything I can
get for you, Ms. Stanton?

22:24.168 --> 22:25.502
No.
Just my daughter.

22:25.570 --> 22:26.603
Her shift's over.

22:26.670 --> 22:27.670
She's just changing
in the back.

22:27.738 --> 22:29.272
Thank God
for small mercies.

22:29.340 --> 22:31.908
I still can't get used to her
in that waitress outfit.

22:31.976 --> 22:33.843
Ashley:
Well, get used to it, mom.

22:33.911 --> 22:36.145
'Cause Maggie says I can keep
working here on weekends

22:36.213 --> 22:37.913
<i>and after school.</i>

22:37.981 --> 22:40.048
I know you're just trying
to provoke me, Ashley,

22:40.117 --> 22:41.617
and I'm not going there.

22:41.684 --> 22:42.985
It's all about independence.

22:43.052 --> 22:44.019
Yeah, well, 'cause it can't be
about the money

22:44.087 --> 22:45.521
she makes in this place.

22:47.324 --> 22:49.091
I got something for Ty.
Would you give it to him?

22:50.593 --> 22:53.128
An iPod?
That's really sweet.

22:53.195 --> 22:54.129
Well, you should give it
to him yourself,

22:54.196 --> 22:55.029
Ms. Stanton.

22:55.097 --> 22:56.331
No, I...

22:56.398 --> 22:57.999
I don't feel like
going to a party.

22:58.066 --> 23:00.001
You're not coming?
Why not?

23:00.568 --> 23:02.369
Because I think I've had
about enough of Amy Fleming

23:02.437 --> 23:04.105
for one day.
That's why.

23:05.040 --> 23:07.040
Anyway,
you guys have a nice time.

23:07.108 --> 23:08.241
Bye-bye.

23:08.308 --> 23:09.643
Bye, mom.

23:13.447 --> 23:15.081
Amy: She said once he
goes away to college,

23:15.149 --> 23:17.483
all I am
is his old girlfriend!

23:17.551 --> 23:19.986
Lou? Lou,
are you listening to me?

23:20.054 --> 23:21.354
Yeah, yeah, I heard you.

23:21.421 --> 23:23.922
Val Stanton.
The "old girlfriend" theory.

23:23.990 --> 23:26.659
At least that's something.
At least it has a name.

23:26.726 --> 23:29.361
What do call dating a guy
whose life plan

23:29.428 --> 23:31.864
doesn't even seem
to include you?

23:31.931 --> 23:33.832
I'm sure he wants
to have babies someday,

23:33.900 --> 23:35.100
with somebody.

23:35.168 --> 23:36.201
But who knows
who that somebody is?

23:36.269 --> 23:37.836
I sure don't!

23:37.904 --> 23:39.737
This doesn't have something
to do with Jerry Junior,

23:39.805 --> 23:40.905
does it?

23:40.973 --> 23:42.439
Not at all.

23:42.507 --> 23:44.642
This has to do with just
dying for a Caesar salad

23:44.710 --> 23:46.577
with extra anchovies.

23:46.645 --> 23:48.212
It has to do with looking
at the calendar

23:48.280 --> 23:50.048
and not liking
what you see.

23:50.115 --> 23:51.515
You think you're-

23:51.583 --> 23:53.384
Psht! Don't go there.
Don't even say the word.

23:53.451 --> 23:57.220
Okay, but if you think
you might be...

23:57.288 --> 24:00.423
Well, you should probably
get one of those,

24:00.491 --> 24:01.758
you know, those tests.

24:01.826 --> 24:03.426
Before you drive yourself
even crazier.

24:03.494 --> 24:05.128
What,
you mean drop everything,

24:05.196 --> 24:06.496
drive all the way to town,

24:06.564 --> 24:08.065
buy a test,
drive all the way back...

24:08.132 --> 24:09.332
And meanwhile,

24:09.400 --> 24:11.167
who's gonna make
the Caesar salad?

24:13.003 --> 24:14.070
Okay.

24:17.708 --> 24:19.041
(Horses nicker)

24:21.712 --> 24:23.946
Yeah, they're still there.

24:26.416 --> 24:28.750
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Yeah, I see them.</i>

24:31.954 --> 24:33.888
The stallion doesn't look
too good.

24:33.956 --> 24:38.359
These tranquilizer guns
don't have much range.

24:38.427 --> 24:39.828
Come with me.

24:39.895 --> 24:41.096
Jane:
I'll stay here,

24:41.163 --> 24:42.996
keep them from coming back
this way.

24:45.767 --> 24:47.101
(Truck rumbles)

24:50.771 --> 24:52.839
The drug store?
What are we doing here?

24:52.906 --> 24:54.641
It doesn't concern you,
okay?

24:54.709 --> 24:56.042
It concerns me that
the computer place

24:56.110 --> 24:57.844
is on the whole other side
of town!

24:57.911 --> 25:00.247
That's our next stop.

25:01.014 --> 25:03.617
I'll be right back.
Don't go anywhere.

25:03.684 --> 25:04.751
(Door shuts)

25:12.825 --> 25:14.360
Uh, hey, Lou!

25:15.027 --> 25:17.730
Caleb. Hey, I was just going
to get some, you know...

25:17.797 --> 25:19.064
I need some advice.

25:19.132 --> 25:20.799
Party supplies -
balloons, streamers...

25:20.867 --> 25:21.700
Jack fired me.

25:21.768 --> 25:23.368
Mixed nuts.

25:23.435 --> 25:24.535
He fired you?

25:24.603 --> 25:25.936
Yeah, for nothing.

25:26.004 --> 25:27.572
What?

25:27.640 --> 25:29.106
Well, I mean...

25:29.174 --> 25:31.542
Maybe I was a little bit
late for work.

25:31.610 --> 25:34.178
Maybe I took it
a step too far.

25:34.246 --> 25:36.046
Maybe I pushed his buttons
one too many times.

25:36.114 --> 25:38.182
So, not exactly
for nothing.

25:38.250 --> 25:40.417
I need this job!

25:40.485 --> 25:42.719
I need your help.
I don't know what else to do!

25:42.787 --> 25:45.155
Okay. Go back and talk
to grampa right now!

25:45.222 --> 25:46.456
And don't bargain,
don't push.

25:46.524 --> 25:48.191
Just beg
for your job back.

25:48.259 --> 25:49.192
Yeah?

25:49.260 --> 25:50.193
Yeah.

25:50.261 --> 25:51.495
That might work,
but...

25:51.562 --> 25:52.962
What do I do if it doesn't?

25:53.030 --> 25:56.365
Just stay far enough away
so he can't hit you.

25:56.433 --> 25:58.967
Yeah.
I'll keep that in mind.

25:59.035 --> 26:00.703
Ladies first.

26:01.705 --> 26:03.806
Party supplies
in a drug store?

26:03.873 --> 26:06.342
What was I...
What was I thinking?

26:13.015 --> 26:15.383
What're we doing now?
Going to the computer place?

26:15.451 --> 26:18.286
No. We are driving
around the block.

26:32.801 --> 26:34.134
(Horses whinny)

26:40.575 --> 26:42.242
(Scope focus clicks)

26:49.583 --> 26:52.985
(Loup pop,
tranquilizer zips through air)

27:01.534 --> 27:02.600
<i>Come on.</i>

27:15.980 --> 27:17.347
Looks pretty deep.

27:19.716 --> 27:22.117
Ah, that's some nasty arrowhead
on that thing.

27:23.887 --> 27:25.954
We're gonna have
to cut it out.

27:29.926 --> 27:30.993
(Snorts)

27:31.928 --> 27:32.995
Needle.

27:34.665 --> 27:37.232
<i>The local kicks in fast.</i>

27:48.244 --> 27:49.311
Scalpel.

27:58.753 --> 28:00.153
<i>Ugh...</i>

28:00.222 --> 28:01.855
Okay, they're could be
some hemorrhaging,

28:01.923 --> 28:03.957
<i>so get those gauze pads ready.</i>

28:04.025 --> 28:05.092
Pliers.

28:07.528 --> 28:09.095
Forceps.

28:09.162 --> 28:12.064
Okay... now get that
right in there.

28:12.566 --> 28:13.700
Open it up?

28:13.767 --> 28:14.934
Yeah, open it up,
as wide as you can.

28:15.001 --> 28:16.102
<i>Scott: There you go.</i>
<i>Ty: Got it.</i>

28:16.169 --> 28:16.902
Scott: Right there.
Ty: Is that good?

28:16.970 --> 28:17.770
Scott:
Yup.

28:17.838 --> 28:18.804
Grab the arrowhead tip.

28:20.241 --> 28:21.307
Okay, there we go.

28:23.176 --> 28:24.409
There we go.

28:25.945 --> 28:26.678
(Grunts)

28:28.013 --> 28:28.947
Wow.

28:29.014 --> 28:30.915
Okay, so far so good.

28:30.983 --> 28:32.351
Not too much bleeding.

28:32.418 --> 28:33.818
<i>Jane:</i>
<i>Wow.</i>

28:33.886 --> 28:36.321
That is a scary looking thing.

28:36.389 --> 28:37.956
Mind if I keep it?

28:39.691 --> 28:41.191
Next time one of those hunters
takes a shot

28:41.260 --> 28:43.060
at one of my horses,

28:43.128 --> 28:45.496
he'll be digging this
outta his butt.

28:45.564 --> 28:47.732
Okay. Now the furacin.

28:47.799 --> 28:49.600
Aren't you gonna
stitch it up first?

28:49.668 --> 28:51.669
Uh, we gotta leave it open,

28:51.737 --> 28:53.036
let it drain.

28:53.104 --> 28:55.338
Whack him full of penicillin.

28:55.406 --> 28:56.539
Syringe?

28:56.607 --> 28:57.940
Uh, which one?

28:58.876 --> 28:59.942
This one.

29:12.922 --> 29:14.757
All right, that's it.

29:14.824 --> 29:16.158
<i>The rest is up to this guy.</i>

29:16.225 --> 29:17.526
Or luck.

29:17.594 --> 29:19.628
Hopefully we haven't used up
our luck already.

29:35.544 --> 29:37.111
Lou!

29:37.179 --> 29:38.713
Val, hi!

29:38.781 --> 29:39.947
I was just...

29:40.015 --> 29:41.482
I'm glad I ran into you.

29:41.550 --> 29:43.684
Look,
I know Amy's very busy,

29:43.751 --> 29:44.984
at least
according to Jack...

29:45.052 --> 29:47.020
Busy... yeah.
Me too.

29:47.087 --> 29:49.055
And I know she's very gifted
with horses.

29:49.123 --> 29:50.390
But, look,
I'm here to tell you

29:50.458 --> 29:52.025
she could use some work
on her people skills.

29:52.126 --> 29:53.226
Right. People skills.

29:53.294 --> 29:55.295
Hey, Val,
let's talk about this later.

29:55.363 --> 29:56.630
At the party.

29:56.698 --> 29:57.698
Well, no, that's just it.
I'm not-

29:57.765 --> 29:58.732
Isn't it always?
I've gotta run.

29:58.800 --> 30:00.833
See you later, Val.
Bye!

30:00.900 --> 30:02.368
(Sighs)

30:02.436 --> 30:05.003
You could use some work
on your people skills too!

30:05.071 --> 30:06.138
God!

30:07.341 --> 30:09.141
Ugh!

30:09.209 --> 30:10.676
Okay,
what's actually going on?

30:10.744 --> 30:13.412
'Cause I'm sick of driving
around the block.

30:13.480 --> 30:14.880
Fine.

30:14.981 --> 30:18.282
I need one of those,
you know... tests,

30:19.218 --> 30:22.019
for a friend
who might be a little bit...

30:22.120 --> 30:23.621
Pregnant?

30:23.723 --> 30:24.823
I hate to tell you,

30:24.923 --> 30:26.424
But you can't be
a little bit pregnant.

30:26.492 --> 30:28.125
And the "friend"?

30:28.160 --> 30:29.394
Oh, come on, Lou,
give me a break.

30:29.462 --> 30:32.295
Who buys a pregnancy test
for a friend?

30:32.364 --> 30:35.098
Okay, I mean, your mother,
sure.

30:35.166 --> 30:38.702
Ever since my mom and dad
decided to try for a boy...

30:38.770 --> 30:39.970
Don't even get me started.

30:40.004 --> 30:41.304
Wait a minute.
What are you saying?

30:41.406 --> 30:44.007
You buy pregnancy tests
for your mother?

30:44.075 --> 30:45.476
I'm a regular.

30:45.543 --> 30:47.677
Okay, I can even put it
on her account.

30:47.745 --> 30:49.078
She wouldn't notice
one more test,

30:49.145 --> 30:50.212
more or less.

30:53.049 --> 30:55.451
(horse grunts,
hooves thud)

31:05.027 --> 31:07.462
Ashley: What happened
with you and my mother?

31:07.530 --> 31:09.498
Well... nothing.
I don't know.

31:09.565 --> 31:10.565
She just brought
Apollo over

31:10.633 --> 31:11.766
so I could take
a look at him.

31:11.833 --> 31:14.167
And, yeah,
maybe I was a little...

31:14.235 --> 31:15.302
Rude?

31:16.237 --> 31:17.471
Why?
Did she say something?

31:17.539 --> 31:19.373
Obviously.
She's my mother.

31:19.441 --> 31:21.008
Well, I don't know.
I was just trying him out

31:21.075 --> 31:22.710
and she was treating it
like it was a jump off

31:22.778 --> 31:24.512
for the Grand Prix!

31:24.579 --> 31:26.647
She has this crazy idea
of taking me and Apollo

31:26.715 --> 31:29.115
on the Arizona show circuit.

31:29.182 --> 31:30.383
You and your mother?

31:30.451 --> 31:31.518
Ashley, haven't you been there,
done that?

31:31.585 --> 31:33.152
Exactly.
Horse shows.

31:33.220 --> 31:35.321
I mean, that's how our problems
started in the first place.

31:35.389 --> 31:37.390
But ever since
I moved back home,

31:37.458 --> 31:38.691
she's been trying
really hard

31:38.759 --> 31:40.126
and I didn't wanna
disappoint her.

31:40.193 --> 31:42.962
So I just figured
blame the horse.

31:43.030 --> 31:45.130
Blame the horse?
Come on, Ash.

31:45.197 --> 31:47.098
Okay,
so it's totally lame,

31:47.166 --> 31:49.000
but it was the easiest thing
to do.

31:49.068 --> 31:50.736
Yeah,
maybe easiest for you.

31:50.804 --> 31:54.139
But what am I supposed
to do now?

31:58.636 --> 32:00.703
Scott: Yeah, he's still
pretty out of it.

32:00.771 --> 32:02.271
But we better get going.

32:02.338 --> 32:04.106
Ty: Hey, come on.
We came all the way up here.

32:04.174 --> 32:05.942
We can at least wait
'til he's on his feet.

32:06.009 --> 32:07.076
I like this kid.

32:07.143 --> 32:08.578
Not exactly afraid of you,
is he?

32:08.645 --> 32:10.279
(Half laughs)
Yeah, it doesn't look good,

32:10.346 --> 32:13.082
my assistant telling me
what to do.

32:13.149 --> 32:15.517
Come on, Scott.
What's the rush?

32:15.585 --> 32:17.518
I just wanna make sure
that I get you back in time

32:17.587 --> 32:19.353
for Lou's...
Supper?

32:19.421 --> 32:20.889
One of Lou's
special suppers...

32:20.957 --> 32:22.356
Where she invites
everyone?

32:22.424 --> 32:23.491
Okay, okay.

32:23.559 --> 32:25.026
It's a party.
It's a surprise party.

32:25.094 --> 32:27.095
But you didn't
hear it from me.

32:27.162 --> 32:28.229
Hear what?

32:31.266 --> 32:32.532
(Horse whinnies)

32:32.601 --> 32:34.267
Hey.

32:34.335 --> 32:35.469
Look at that.

32:40.008 --> 32:41.075
(Whinnying)

32:44.312 --> 32:46.346
Wow... you see?

32:47.281 --> 32:49.782
It was worth waiting for,
after all.

32:49.850 --> 32:52.819
Yeah.
Now we can get going.

32:52.886 --> 32:53.820
If we're late,

32:53.887 --> 32:55.287
Lou's gonna kill me.

33:02.963 --> 33:04.229
Hey, Jack.

33:04.296 --> 33:06.064
If you're back
for Ty's going away party,

33:06.132 --> 33:08.033
you're a little early.

33:10.003 --> 33:11.302
(Sighing)
Well, actually,

33:11.370 --> 33:12.971
I was hoping we could
talk about my job.

33:13.039 --> 33:14.072
What job?

33:14.140 --> 33:16.341
You don't have a job
here any more.

33:16.408 --> 33:17.643
Come on, Jack,

33:17.710 --> 33:18.844
I know you're
a little bit annoyed.

33:18.911 --> 33:21.145
Annoyed?
Why would I be annoyed?

33:21.212 --> 33:25.016
The minute I fired you,
I stopped being annoyed.

33:25.083 --> 33:26.717
I'm begging you,
man!

33:26.785 --> 33:28.686
I need the work.

33:28.754 --> 33:30.454
I'll do anything you ask,
just...

33:30.522 --> 33:33.758
Please, can I have
my job back?

33:33.950 --> 33:35.017
Well...

33:36.252 --> 33:38.787
If I did take you back,

33:38.854 --> 33:41.489
of course,
we'd have to renegotiate.

33:41.556 --> 33:45.293
Thanks, Jack!
I knew you'd come around.

33:46.428 --> 33:47.996
Renegotiate?

33:52.867 --> 33:54.101
Val:
(Exhales)

33:55.369 --> 33:57.337
Well, I'm back.

33:57.405 --> 33:59.139
This better be good.

33:59.207 --> 34:00.407
Mrs. Stanton, look.

34:00.474 --> 34:01.775
It was really unprofessional
of me

34:01.843 --> 34:02.742
to let my personal life

34:02.811 --> 34:03.811
get in the way...

34:03.878 --> 34:04.611
That's Ashley?

34:04.679 --> 34:05.979
(Apollo grunts)

34:07.682 --> 34:09.849
<i>Mrs. Stanton:</i>
<i>Oh, Amy...</i>

34:10.784 --> 34:13.286
Look... Oh...
I don't know what you did, but...

34:13.353 --> 34:14.920
(Sighs)
Ashley and Apollo,

34:14.987 --> 34:16.289
they're great together.

34:16.356 --> 34:17.956
But I don't think
either one of them

34:18.025 --> 34:20.193
are gonna wind up
on the show circuit.

34:20.260 --> 34:21.760
Well,
that's the whole point, dear.

34:21.829 --> 34:24.196
I mean, look,
they're more than ready.

34:24.263 --> 34:27.998
<i>Amy:</i> <i>Yeah, except...
</i> <i>Ashley doesn't want to go.</i>

34:28.067 --> 34:29.301
What?

34:29.368 --> 34:30.735
(Approaching hoof beats,
Apollo grunts)

34:31.670 --> 34:34.605
We don't do well
with horse shows, Mom.

34:34.672 --> 34:36.741
I know it
and I think you know it, too.

34:36.809 --> 34:39.577
So, what was this
little demonstration

34:39.645 --> 34:41.344
the two of you cooked up,
hm?

34:41.411 --> 34:42.813
<i>Ashley:</i>
<i>Amy thought I owed it to you</i>

34:42.880 --> 34:45.216
to show you that there's
nothing wrong with Apollo,

34:45.283 --> 34:46.449
so that you could stop
spending money

34:46.516 --> 34:47.583
on trying to fix him

34:47.652 --> 34:48.685
and spend money
on other things,

34:48.753 --> 34:50.888
like shopping, lunches...

34:52.190 --> 34:54.190
How about a mother/daughter
spa vacation?

35:01.765 --> 35:03.532
I, uh...

35:03.600 --> 35:05.335
I was gonna drop
a couple of these off

35:05.402 --> 35:06.669
at the gift shop
in town.

35:06.737 --> 35:08.171
What do you think?

35:08.239 --> 35:11.707
<i>Ty:</i> <i>Oh, man.
</i> <i>Amy would love this.</i>

35:11.775 --> 35:14.309
I've never bought
a painting before.

35:14.377 --> 35:15.777
How much is it?

35:15.845 --> 35:17.846
Oh, you couldn't afford
one of Jane's paintings.

35:17.914 --> 35:19.982
Not until after
you've graduated vet school

35:20.049 --> 35:22.050
and worked for about
ten years.

35:22.118 --> 35:24.586
That's why
I'm giving it to you.

35:24.653 --> 35:26.121
Something to mark this day.

35:26.189 --> 35:27.256
Ty:
(Stunned gasp)

35:29.224 --> 35:30.624
Thank you!

35:31.393 --> 35:32.793
This is amazing!

35:36.631 --> 35:38.366
Scott: Is there a two-for-one
special in there?

35:38.433 --> 35:41.168
Ah...
I gave you one last time.

35:41.236 --> 35:42.203
You've had your quota.

35:42.271 --> 35:44.404
Come on, Scott.
Let's go!

35:44.471 --> 35:45.906
Yeah, right.

35:45.973 --> 35:47.473
Suddenly, he's got a present
for his girlfriend,

35:47.541 --> 35:48.808
he's the one
in the big hurry.

35:48.876 --> 35:50.443
(Half laughs)

35:50.511 --> 35:51.778
See you later, Jane.

35:51.845 --> 35:54.180
See ya, Jane.
Thanks again!

36:00.120 --> 36:02.187
(Birds twitter outside)

36:08.594 --> 36:10.996
No. Really?

36:16.335 --> 36:17.468
Really?

36:36.285 --> 36:38.286
(Plane buzzes overhead)

36:47.662 --> 36:49.062
(Horse whinnies)

36:52.200 --> 36:54.535
You are a miracle worker.

36:54.602 --> 36:56.704
I mean anyone who can
get my mom off my case

36:56.771 --> 36:57.938
about this horse...

36:58.005 --> 37:00.040
(Laughs)
Well, you owe me.

37:00.107 --> 37:02.074
(Amy and Ashley laugh,
Amy's phone rings)

37:02.142 --> 37:03.609
Hold on.
Actually, could you hold this?

37:03.677 --> 37:04.811
Thanks.

37:05.779 --> 37:07.714
It's Ty.
He's on his way back.

37:07.781 --> 37:09.515
Aren't you going
to go meet him?

37:09.583 --> 37:11.684
Well, he's only been gone
for a few hours.

37:11.752 --> 37:12.852
Yeah, but after tonight,

37:12.919 --> 37:13.986
he's gonna be gone
for months.

37:14.054 --> 37:16.722
Yes, but we discussed that,
I don't know,

37:16.789 --> 37:18.390
we wouldn't make
a big deal about it.

37:18.458 --> 37:19.424
Yeah. I heard.

37:19.492 --> 37:21.626
And whose lame idea
was that?

37:21.694 --> 37:24.462
Well... I don't know.
It was his, I guess,

37:24.529 --> 37:25.796
but I went along with it.

37:25.865 --> 37:27.498
Yeah,
but guys just say that!

37:27.566 --> 37:30.068
You're not supposed
to go along with it!

37:30.135 --> 37:31.769
Oh, come on, Amy.

37:31.837 --> 37:33.071
You buy him a gift

37:33.138 --> 37:35.173
and then you keep it
in the box at Maggie's?

37:35.241 --> 37:37.641
Soraya told you
about the halter...

37:37.709 --> 37:39.610
Well, what do you think?

37:39.678 --> 37:41.311
Today is his last day.

37:41.379 --> 37:42.545
If it was me,

37:42.613 --> 37:45.315
I'd be giving him a day
he wouldn't forget.

37:45.383 --> 37:47.517
(Sighs)
Okay, maybe you're right.

37:47.585 --> 37:49.386
Of course I'm right.

37:50.321 --> 37:52.990
Now you owe me!
Big time!

37:53.057 --> 37:54.124
Go!

37:55.159 --> 37:56.492
Get outta here!

37:58.228 --> 37:59.295
(Door opens)

38:01.698 --> 38:05.301
So, I figure you and Amy
must've worked things out?

38:05.369 --> 38:06.619
(Sighs)

38:06.620 --> 38:07.998
I suppose.

38:09.739 --> 38:13.008
Seems Ashley thinks that
show jumping can be fun,

38:13.075 --> 38:15.210
as long as she doesn't go
to shows with her mother.

38:15.278 --> 38:16.511
(Laughs)

38:17.146 --> 38:19.281
What can I say?

38:19.348 --> 38:21.482
- She's probably right.
- Hm.

38:23.185 --> 38:24.786
<i>(Truck engine revs,</i>
<i>door shuts)</i>

38:24.853 --> 38:26.587
Where's she off to
in such a hurry?

38:26.655 --> 38:28.422
(Truck rumbles)

38:29.257 --> 38:33.027
<i>Jack:</i> <i>My best guess,</i>
<i>it has something to do with Ty.</i>

38:33.094 --> 38:34.962
She's really gonna miss him.

38:35.030 --> 38:37.164
Oh. And you're not?

38:37.665 --> 38:39.333
Well, I'm hoping...

38:40.101 --> 38:42.536
Caleb will manage to pick up
some of the slack.

38:42.603 --> 38:47.206
I'll probably end up putting in
a few extra hours myself.

38:47.274 --> 38:49.008
Jack, shut up.

38:51.678 --> 38:54.580
Yeah. Okay.
I'm gonna miss him.

38:58.252 --> 38:59.985
(Whisk scrapes bowl)

39:01.154 --> 39:02.654
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Hey.</i>

39:02.721 --> 39:04.189
Um, look,

39:04.257 --> 39:05.958
I know I seemed a little bit
stressed out before.

39:06.025 --> 39:07.192
Don't worry, Lou.

39:07.260 --> 39:09.061
I doubled the anchovies
in the dressing.

39:09.128 --> 39:10.495
That's great.

39:11.431 --> 39:13.365
But about that whole
maternal thing,

39:13.433 --> 39:14.899
or lack of.

39:16.268 --> 39:18.769
I would never blame
Jerry Junior for anything.

39:18.837 --> 39:20.071
He's a sweetheart.

39:20.138 --> 39:21.372
It's okay.

39:21.440 --> 39:23.674
I just figured you were
manic about the party.

39:23.741 --> 39:25.742
Yeah, well,
it wasn't the party

39:25.810 --> 39:27.744
so much as what
we had been...

39:27.812 --> 39:30.714
(Marnie shushes Jerry
as he cries)

39:31.950 --> 39:34.484
He's got great timing.
(Jerry Junior cries)

39:34.551 --> 39:37.454
Let me...
Let me just...

39:37.521 --> 39:38.821
You can finish
the salad.

39:38.889 --> 39:40.490
(Jerry junior cries)

39:40.557 --> 39:42.092
Yeah.

39:42.159 --> 39:43.726
Yeah!

39:43.794 --> 39:44.760
(Murmurs softly)

39:44.828 --> 39:47.397
(Laughs)
Is that better?

39:49.765 --> 39:51.900
(Grunts and coos)

39:56.706 --> 39:58.940
(Coos contently)

40:01.711 --> 40:03.045
See, Lou?

40:05.047 --> 40:06.347
When your time comes,

40:06.415 --> 40:07.748
you're gonna have that
maternal thing in spades.

40:07.816 --> 40:10.151
(Jerry junior coos contentedly)

40:15.590 --> 40:17.258
(Exhales)
Hey.

40:17.326 --> 40:18.626
Boy, you cut it
pretty close.

40:18.693 --> 40:20.027
What're you
talking about?

40:20.094 --> 40:21.761
That special overpriced
custom-made halter

40:21.829 --> 40:23.263
you spent hours
agonizing about,

40:23.331 --> 40:25.198
making sure you picked
the perfect one

40:25.266 --> 40:26.733
and double checking
that the engraving guy

40:26.800 --> 40:27.867
knew how to spell
"Harley."

40:27.935 --> 40:29.469
Well, okay.
Do you still have it?

40:29.537 --> 40:31.438
Well, I almost sold it
to another guy

40:31.506 --> 40:32.739
with a horse
named Harley,

40:32.806 --> 40:34.408
but you are in luck.

40:34.475 --> 40:36.775
You're funny.
I'll see you at the party.

40:36.843 --> 40:39.011
Uh. Oh, you can...

40:39.079 --> 40:40.712
You can just pay me later!

40:41.448 --> 40:43.182
So, you're still
working here?

40:43.250 --> 40:45.984
I guess things went well
with Jack.

40:46.053 --> 40:47.853
Well? It went great.

40:47.921 --> 40:49.221
Ashley:
Really?

40:49.289 --> 40:50.856
What happened?

40:50.924 --> 40:53.558
Well, let's just say
negotiations were intense,

40:53.625 --> 40:54.926
but, in the end,

40:54.993 --> 40:57.062
I got pretty much
what I was hoping for.

40:57.129 --> 40:59.531
Jack gave you a raise?

40:59.998 --> 41:01.832
Times are tough.
Haven't you heard?

41:01.900 --> 41:02.934
What did you get?

41:03.001 --> 41:04.202
Because Soraya
and I were betting

41:04.270 --> 41:05.770
that if you were gonna play
hardball with Jack,

41:05.837 --> 41:08.138
he would just fire
your ass.

41:08.206 --> 41:09.873
Well, as a matter of fact,
he did.

41:09.941 --> 41:11.942
But with a little
fancy footwork,

41:12.009 --> 41:13.377
I got my job back.

41:13.445 --> 41:15.679
Really?
That's awesome.

41:15.746 --> 41:18.815
Yeah.
For almost the same pay!

41:56.007 --> 41:57.426
Jack?

41:58.427 --> 41:59.226
(Exhales)

41:59.227 --> 42:00.678
My favourite.

42:00.679 --> 42:02.512
No kidding.
Me, too.

42:05.516 --> 42:06.883
(Laughs)

42:06.951 --> 42:08.385
All right,
I got a confession to make:

42:08.453 --> 42:09.419
Lou told me.

42:09.487 --> 42:12.155
(Laughs)
Yeah, well...

42:12.223 --> 42:13.256
That doesn't surprise me.

42:13.324 --> 42:15.225
Lou doesn't leave much
to chance.

42:15.293 --> 42:17.593
Likes to have everything
pretty well planned out.

42:17.660 --> 42:19.195
Yeah, well, that's something
her and I have in common,

42:19.262 --> 42:20.229
I guess.

42:20.297 --> 42:21.663
Yeah, thing is,

42:21.731 --> 42:24.066
sometimes life throws you
a curve ball.

42:24.134 --> 42:25.401
<i>Yeah,</i>

42:25.469 --> 42:27.603
well, from the little
that Lou told me

42:27.670 --> 42:29.171
about what your family's
been through

42:29.239 --> 42:31.440
the last couple of years,

42:31.508 --> 42:33.475
she throws some
pretty big curves, Jack.

42:36.378 --> 42:38.113
Yeah, big enough
to make you realize

42:38.180 --> 42:39.380
nothing's written in stone.

42:42.351 --> 42:44.852
<i>Mallory:</i> <i>Hey, guys,</i>

You were looking
for the vet.

43:14.781 --> 43:16.682
The Cessna 172.

43:16.750 --> 43:18.884
Is something wrong?

43:20.420 --> 43:23.321
I'm afraid we've lost
radio contact.
