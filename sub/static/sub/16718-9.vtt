WEBVTT

00:05.920 --> 00:07.680
124, officer on the ground.

00:07.840 --> 00:10.000
I repeat, officer on the ground.

00:10.120 --> 00:11.440
Automatic gun
shots are fired here.

00:11.560 --> 00:12.560
Shots are fired.

00:12.720 --> 00:13.320
Shots are fired.

00:13.440 --> 00:14.840
To all units, the suspicious car

00:14.960 --> 00:15.720
drove to the south
side of the building,

00:15.840 --> 00:16.800
between the North Main and...

00:19.120 --> 00:20.320
Is this a firefight?

00:20.480 --> 00:21.800
All units confirm that an
officer is on the ground.

00:21.920 --> 00:23.200
I'm not prepared for that.

00:23.360 --> 00:26.160
To all units, an officer
has passed out here.

00:26.280 --> 00:27.680
I need help right now.

00:27.800 --> 00:28.760
For how much longer?

00:28.880 --> 00:29.840
A minute.

00:31.480 --> 00:33.120
A blatant day to ride in
the emergency vehicle.

00:33.320 --> 00:36.200
Remember, the officers have
a better chance of survival

00:36.400 --> 00:37.520
because you are there.

00:37.640 --> 00:38.760
We'll bring the
emergency room to you.

00:39.000 --> 00:39.960
It's all about this.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.560
The headquarters
said Main and Alameda.

00:44.680 --> 00:45.840
Why are we pulling up here?

00:46.040 --> 00:48.680
We're supposed to hold behind the
barrier until we're allowed through.

00:50.200 --> 00:51.560
It'll be nasty
when we get there.

00:51.720 --> 00:53.200
You have to be prepared for it.

00:53.320 --> 00:55.920
All units, all threats on the
ground have been neutralized.

00:56.040 --> 00:59.200
I ask for two emergency vehicles
for two wounded officers...

00:59.320 --> 01:00.760
Okay, let's go.

01:08.320 --> 01:10.120
Officer wounded.  Fast.  Fast.

01:15.280 --> 01:16.240
Are you going.

01:18.760 --> 01:20.080
Kean!

01:26.120 --> 01:27.840
Gunshot wound
on the right thigh.

01:28.080 --> 01:29.600
Lots of blood.  Printing compound.

01:31.520 --> 01:33.360
Please tell me how
bad is it for you?

01:33.600 --> 01:35.080
How long has she
been passed out?

01:35.200 --> 01:36.760
A few minutes.

01:36.880 --> 01:37.960
-What's her name?
-Fiona.

01:38.120 --> 01:39.280
Officer Burnside,
Fiona Burnside.

01:39.440 --> 01:40.920
Dr.  Kean.

01:41.040 --> 01:42.720
Focus.

01:42.920 --> 01:43.600
Hide everything else.

01:43.720 --> 01:44.720
Just treat the
patient in front of you.

01:48.640 --> 01:50.000
See, Willis, he's hit too!

01:50.120 --> 01:51.240
Take care of the wound.

01:51.360 --> 01:53.240
Put a pressure bandage
on, stop the bleeding.

01:54.480 --> 01:55.760
There's too much blood
in there, I can't stop it.

01:55.880 --> 01:56.880
Put pressure on the wound.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.480
If necessary, put your
fingers in the wound.

01:58.600 --> 01:59.560
You have to stop the bleeding.

01:59.680 --> 02:01.360
Fiona, you have to fight!

02:01.480 --> 02:03.240
Please hold still
so we can help you.

02:03.360 --> 02:05.080
Over here!  He's bleeding to death!

02:05.280 --> 02:06.800
Dr.  Kean, can you do this?

02:06.960 --> 02:07.920
Yes.

02:08.039 --> 02:09.000
Good.  Are you going.

02:09.320 --> 02:10.600
Clear.  Good.

02:11.920 --> 02:13.360
Fiona.

02:13.600 --> 02:14.760
Fiona...

02:14.880 --> 02:16.880
Wake up.  You have to fight.

02:22.480 --> 02:23.920
Let me take it.  I am a doctor.

02:24.120 --> 02:25.560
I have to stop this bleeding.

02:26.960 --> 02:28.400
Check the back-knee pulse.

02:29.720 --> 02:30.880
I have to give an IV.

02:31.080 --> 02:32.080
Can you prepare an IV?

02:34.000 --> 02:36.560
Turn the drip wide open.
It should run as quickly as possible.

02:36.680 --> 02:38.160
Officer, could you put
pressure on that wound, please?

02:38.280 --> 02:40.560
Dr.  Kean!  Management report!
How does it look like?

02:40.800 --> 02:42.400
Massive pelvic trauma.

02:42.720 --> 02:44.840
Arterial bleeding.
Vital signs unstable.

02:45.080 --> 02:47.600
I put on a pressure bandage.
An infusion is now running.

02:51.200 --> 02:52.400
He's trying to say something.

02:52.720 --> 02:55.560
Hail Mary, full of
grace.  The gentleman...

02:56.320 --> 02:57.240
He prays.

02:58.920 --> 03:00.680
It must be transported
immediately.

03:03.280 --> 03:05.160
Hold on, will you?

03:05.840 --> 03:07.880
... this is what it looked like
when 3 officers were shot today...

03:08.040 --> 03:08.920
EMERGENCY ADMISSION AMBULANCE

03:09.160 --> 03:10.280
Downtown L.A. Shootout

03:10.400 --> 03:11.600
... by heavily armed attackers.

03:11.720 --> 03:12.880
It's been three hours.

03:13.080 --> 03:14.440
How long should that take?

03:14.560 --> 03:15.920
We work as fast as we can.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.360
Dr.  Dixon,

03:20.560 --> 03:21.920
here is a patient
who needs help.

03:24.480 --> 03:25.800
Are you a doctor?

03:26.200 --> 03:27.160
How old are they?

03:27.440 --> 03:28.800
I am a doctor.

03:28.920 --> 03:30.480
How can I help you?

03:30.800 --> 03:32.440
I have lupus...

03:32.560 --> 03:33.720
Dr.  Dixon, quickly to the ramp.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.480
Code "Red on Blue",
multiple gunshot wounds.

03:35.840 --> 03:37.960
-I'm on my way.
- Sorry, I spoke to him.

03:38.160 --> 03:39.320
Ma'am, you will have to wait.
We have a problem.

03:39.640 --> 03:40.880
Risa will assist you.

03:41.200 --> 03:43.280
I have a problem!

03:45.280 --> 03:46.760
Woman, 32 years,

03:46.960 --> 03:49.200
a large-caliber gunshot
wound in the right thigh.

03:49.440 --> 03:51.720
Pulsating bleeding on the spot.
Pressure bandage applied.

03:51.840 --> 03:52.920
No exit wound.

03:53.080 --> 03:54.120
Fiona...

04:05.880 --> 04:08.640
Doc, promise me she'll survive.

04:08.760 --> 04:10.000
We'll do everything
we can for them.

04:10.120 --> 04:11.360
No.  Promise me

04:12.600 --> 04:13.560
I promise it.

04:13.880 --> 04:15.360
For how much longer?

04:15.480 --> 04:17.399
A maximum of three minutes.
Dr.  Kean is in the other car.

04:17.680 --> 04:19.200
-I am on the way.
-Good.

04:24.200 --> 04:25.720
I give five units of morphine.

04:27.320 --> 04:29.280
OK.

04:29.520 --> 04:30.680
Tell my wife...

04:31.640 --> 04:33.760
Tell her i love her.

04:34.040 --> 04:37.080
No, you can tell her yourself.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.640
You will not die.

04:53.280 --> 04:54.600
What is a "Red-on-Blue" code?

04:54.720 --> 04:56.040
Wounded police officers.

04:56.440 --> 04:57.800
How does it look like?

04:57.960 --> 04:59.520
Forty year old, extensively
blasted off tissue,

04:59.720 --> 05:01.040
on the right thigh and pelvis.

05:01.240 --> 05:02.840
Systolic blood
pressure is down to 60.

05:03.040 --> 05:04.000
How much blood did he lose?

05:04.120 --> 05:05.240
At least three liters.

05:05.360 --> 05:07.320
How long has he been
in the pressure bandage?

05:07.600 --> 05:09.400
-Dr.  Kean?
-Dr.  Kean.

05:09.640 --> 05:10.880
Sorry... nine minutes.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.400
Okay, Leighton.
Stop the bleeding.

05:12.520 --> 05:14.160
- Let's get him in, go.
-Over here.

05:14.280 --> 05:15.600
Dr.  Kean, you come with me.

05:15.720 --> 05:17.360
A woman with gunshot wounds.

05:17.560 --> 05:19.160
Is the ball still in there?

05:19.320 --> 05:21.320
Yes, with X-rays we rule
out that the sphere wandered.

05:21.600 --> 05:24.720
Officer Eric Hawkins, 33, gunshot
wound in the center of the torso.

05:24.840 --> 05:25.880
Abrasion on the neck.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.120
Blood pressure is 83 to 40.
Heart rate is at 130.

05:28.440 --> 05:29.440
Hey are you OK?

05:29.880 --> 05:30.840
Yes.

05:30.960 --> 05:32.640
Kean, go back inside.
They have driver service.

05:32.760 --> 05:35.960
Dr.  Rorish, would it be
okay if I take care of it?

05:36.160 --> 05:37.920
I'll take care of you.

05:41.080 --> 05:42.880
She is in shock
from the loss of blood.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.160
-Fiona.
-Hey.

05:47.320 --> 05:49.600
-Fiona.
-Mom, 100 units of fentanyl.

05:49.840 --> 05:51.200
-Fiona.
-Hey.  Hey

05:51.400 --> 05:52.960
They are taken care of.
Now it is your turn.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.040
Dr.  Pineda, look at
the wound in the neck.

05:55.480 --> 05:58.280
It appears superficial.
It has to be sewn.

05:58.480 --> 06:00.160
There is a 2 cm
bullet in the left

06:00.280 --> 06:01.760
flank, with a double exit wound.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.480
The bullet went right through.

06:03.640 --> 06:05.080
Hang two units of blood
and help with the bleeding.

06:05.280 --> 06:08.200
0 Append negative and then
usher in mass transfusion.

06:08.320 --> 06:09.280
How far are you, Dixon?

06:09.400 --> 06:10.960
I put an 18 in her
external jugular vein.

06:11.080 --> 06:13.240
I need a thigh x-ray over here!

06:15.760 --> 06:18.320
He needs a lot of blood.
Risa, add two units!

06:18.440 --> 06:19.600
He's bleeding all over the place.

06:19.720 --> 06:21.440
Keep going, will you?
Work faster.

06:21.560 --> 06:23.440
The tamponade does not help.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.200
Tell my wife that I love her.

06:31.400 --> 06:32.840
I'll do it.

06:35.160 --> 06:36.760
I start the resuscitation.

06:36.920 --> 06:38.240
Damn it!  Tony, come on.

06:40.040 --> 06:41.280
Look at me

06:41.440 --> 06:42.360
The more exercise,
the more blood loss.

06:42.600 --> 06:44.200
All right, pulse check.

06:44.520 --> 06:45.640
Stop the massage.

06:45.760 --> 06:48.000
- Stop the massage.
-Dr.  Kean.

06:48.120 --> 06:49.760
Pulse check.  Right away.

06:52.040 --> 06:53.040
CONIOTOMY KIT

06:53.760 --> 06:55.400
Still no pulse.

06:56.240 --> 06:57.200
His heart is empty.

06:57.320 --> 06:58.560
He lost all of his blood.

06:58.680 --> 07:00.240
Can't we use an aortic clamp?

07:00.480 --> 07:01.560
He can't survive with that.

07:01.680 --> 07:02.800
Half of the blood
is on the floor.

07:07.280 --> 07:09.200
Stop the resuscitation.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.800
Time of death is 12:07 p.m.

07:17.920 --> 07:20.040
No, no... Tony, no...

07:20.160 --> 07:21.120
Dr.  Rorish,

07:21.480 --> 07:22.440
you should see that.

07:23.600 --> 07:25.040
It's a big ball.

07:25.200 --> 07:26.920
You see, it's in the
middle of the soft tissue.

07:27.040 --> 07:28.200
She will need an operation.

07:28.320 --> 07:30.680
Risa, call upstairs that
we're on our way, will you?

07:30.800 --> 07:31.960
Out of the way.

07:32.080 --> 07:33.600
Wait.
Where are you taking them?

07:33.720 --> 07:34.840
She undergoes surgery.
All is well.

07:34.960 --> 07:36.200
Doc, you promised me.

07:36.440 --> 07:38.920
-You'll survive, right?
-Yes.

07:40.640 --> 07:42.920
How should we have
managed that today?

07:43.040 --> 07:45.440
Bullets of explosives
pelted us...

07:45.560 --> 07:47.360
... eight units have
already flowed.

07:47.720 --> 07:49.400
It's a big bullet of
unknown caliber

07:49.640 --> 07:52.680
it is probably between
the femur and the muscle...

07:52.880 --> 07:54.120
We are on the way up.

07:54.280 --> 07:54.960
Stop!

07:55.080 --> 07:55.880
Stop!

07:59.480 --> 08:00.920
Stop stop

08:01.120 --> 08:02.360
You better go back.

08:02.560 --> 08:04.600
Please... go back.

08:04.760 --> 08:06.000
What's happening?

08:06.240 --> 08:08.040
Nobody is allowed to move it!

08:08.160 --> 08:11.120
She has undone 20mm
explosive ammunition in her leg.

08:11.400 --> 08:12.360
What?

08:13.880 --> 08:15.280
It has a range of four meters.

08:20.120 --> 08:21.320
They saw what she was
doing to her boyfriend.

08:23.040 --> 08:24.320
Any movement can detonate them.

08:34.520 --> 08:37.480
Go ahead.
We're going down the corridor.

08:38.080 --> 08:40.440
So she has a bomb
in her.  So to say.

08:40.600 --> 08:41.760
And we have to find
a way to get them out.

08:41.960 --> 08:43.240
It is not that easy.

08:43.360 --> 08:45.560
Yes, we have a
professional for such cases.

08:45.680 --> 08:46.640
How long does it take?

08:46.760 --> 08:47.720
An hour, maybe.

08:47.880 --> 08:49.320
I clarify this with my people.

08:49.600 --> 08:52.160
Even with the tamponade,
the bleeding spreads in the leg.

08:52.440 --> 08:54.200
She's bleeding to death
before the doctor can be here.

08:54.440 --> 08:57.080
The hospital has strict
rules in these cases.

08:57.280 --> 08:59.280
We must not let our
employees take part in this case.

08:59.400 --> 09:00.880
You come to me now
with rules?  Look...

09:01.000 --> 09:02.840
-I promised to save her.
-You promised?

09:04.960 --> 09:06.520
Yes.  I promised

09:07.800 --> 09:09.760
Dr.  Campbell, we
can do it in the lobby.

09:09.920 --> 09:12.040
There is enough space
there to shield them far.

09:12.160 --> 09:13.120
No.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.120
I have a responsibility

09:16.200 --> 09:19.480
to the hospital,
staff, and California.

09:19.600 --> 09:22.720
Nobody gets close to the patient
until the bomb specialist arrives.

09:23.160 --> 09:24.280
That is an order.

09:24.480 --> 09:26.160
You can't command me to do anything.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.720
I don't work for you, right?

09:28.000 --> 09:30.160
Willis is right.
You have to let us do this.

09:30.320 --> 09:31.520
Maybe I can't stop you.

09:33.640 --> 09:34.800
But I can stop you.

09:36.400 --> 09:37.880
He does it alone.

09:41.840 --> 09:45.080
That's the hardest
part of this job.

09:45.800 --> 09:48.000
You talk to her
directly, without emotion.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.640
Just say the words.

09:52.040 --> 09:53.000
Which words?

09:53.920 --> 09:55.120
That her husband died.

09:56.440 --> 09:58.840
Dr.  Kean, you need
to hear these words.

09:59.000 --> 09:59.960
Do you understand?

10:00.680 --> 10:01.640
Risa...

10:01.960 --> 10:03.640
Where is Officer
Tony Hall's wife?

10:06.120 --> 10:07.240
Thank you.

10:11.120 --> 10:12.120
Oh God.

10:13.640 --> 10:14.600
They're going to have a baby.

10:14.720 --> 10:17.040
Dr.  Kean, look
at me, listen to me.

10:17.160 --> 10:18.520
No I'm sorry.  I...

10:18.640 --> 10:19.880
All right.  All good.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.680
I can not do this.
I'm so sorry.

10:21.920 --> 10:23.560
The ambulance will be
at the ramp in 2 minutes.

10:24.600 --> 10:26.440
All right, go outside.

10:26.720 --> 10:27.840
I take care of it.

10:28.960 --> 10:29.920
Are you going.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.160
Thirty-year-olds with
blunt facial injuries

10:33.280 --> 10:34.800
Suspected broken
nose, conscious.

10:34.920 --> 10:36.760
Thirty-one year old,
head trauma with forehead

10:36.880 --> 10:37.880
injury, he passed
out in the bathroom.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.320
In a shower...

10:39.480 --> 10:40.560
You chose a great day, Xander.

10:40.680 --> 10:41.960
They are not stressed at all.

10:42.120 --> 10:43.440
How long will it take you?

10:43.560 --> 10:45.000
Our flight to Miami leaves at 9

10:45.120 --> 10:46.400
p.m. for the honeymoon cruise.

10:46.600 --> 10:47.920
Karen and Xander...

10:48.760 --> 10:50.360
My favorite couple is back.

10:51.000 --> 10:51.960
You now her?

10:52.200 --> 10:54.280
Go on, tell her
how you proposed.

10:55.520 --> 10:56.680
The last time we were here

10:56.800 --> 10:58.320
- he put a ring...
- treasure...

10:59.080 --> 11:00.040
Was that you?

11:00.240 --> 11:01.400
You are a legend here.

11:01.840 --> 11:02.840
What did you do now?

11:04.440 --> 11:05.840
Our wedding was last night.

11:06.320 --> 11:07.600
I wanted to do
something special.

11:07.720 --> 11:09.800
He fell on me in the
shower when we...

11:09.960 --> 11:11.480
... danced!

11:11.600 --> 11:13.280
Okay, five and six.
Ll be right there.

11:13.440 --> 11:14.240
Thank you.

11:15.800 --> 11:16.760
How are the cops?

11:16.880 --> 11:18.440
I'll tell you later.
What you have there?

11:18.560 --> 11:20.480
Sixty-one year old,
shortness of breath.

11:20.600 --> 11:21.840
Sounds like fluid in your lungs.

11:21.960 --> 11:23.280
His chest needs an X-ray.

11:23.520 --> 11:24.720
I need your booking agent.

11:24.840 --> 11:26.560
You have more action
here than in Vegas.

11:26.680 --> 11:28.040
He's kind of a magician.

11:28.280 --> 11:29.960
I prefer sleight of
hand, or masters of

11:30.120 --> 11:33.640
deception, if you
like it more dramatic.

11:33.800 --> 11:35.040
I am Johnny Prentiss.

11:35.240 --> 11:36.320
Let's bring him in.

11:36.600 --> 11:37.960
Yes, let's take a look
behind the scenes.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.160
I don't see any free liquid.

11:43.400 --> 11:44.520
The bullet did not
hit any vital organs.

11:44.760 --> 11:47.080
I need to know
how Fiona is doing.

11:47.200 --> 11:48.520
Could we give him more morphine?

11:48.640 --> 11:51.200
Two units of
Dilaudid, intravenous.

11:51.440 --> 11:52.600
Dr.  Rorish...

11:52.720 --> 11:54.240
-Dr.  Rorish.
-Yes what's up?

11:54.360 --> 11:55.760
Weak pulse, blood
pressure drops rapidly.

11:55.880 --> 11:58.400
He seemed okay,
but now suddenly...

11:58.600 --> 12:00.080
He's bloated and hardened.

12:00.240 --> 12:02.360
Describe this breathing
to me, Dr.  Dixon.

12:06.200 --> 12:07.720
Kussmaul breathing.
He's got acidosis.

12:07.880 --> 12:09.200
That's true.

12:09.640 --> 12:11.120
Compartment syndrome.

12:11.280 --> 12:12.880
The swollen abdominal
tissue strangles its

12:13.000 --> 12:15.200
organs, causing the
acid to flow into the blood.

12:16.120 --> 12:17.200
Here, daddy.

12:17.360 --> 12:19.200
So we have to free the
organs from pressure.

12:19.320 --> 12:20.640
Why, Dr.  Dixon?

12:20.800 --> 12:22.160
By cutting open
the abdominal wall

12:22.400 --> 12:24.760
the soft tissue can
expand and regenerate.

12:24.920 --> 12:26.640
That's true.

12:31.040 --> 12:32.120
The blood pressure normalizes.

12:32.240 --> 12:33.960
Okay, let's get him
to the operating room.

12:34.160 --> 12:35.120
Good.

12:35.680 --> 12:36.920
Just a moment.

12:37.040 --> 12:38.200
-Ready?
-Good.

12:38.360 --> 12:39.480
Let's push him out.  Come on.

12:42.160 --> 12:43.760
Are you ready to move them?

12:45.440 --> 12:46.400
Yes.

12:46.520 --> 12:47.480
Slowly.

13:01.880 --> 13:02.960
Stop!

13:05.360 --> 13:06.560
What's happening?

13:07.320 --> 13:08.760
The bed vibrates
through the wheels.

13:09.320 --> 13:10.640
We have to carry it.

13:10.920 --> 13:13.000
Hey doc  We will help.

13:36.400 --> 13:37.840
Fiona, we'll get through this.

13:41.640 --> 13:43.360
Okay one...

13:44.280 --> 13:45.240
Two...

13:45.680 --> 13:46.640
Three.

14:02.240 --> 14:03.360
All right, Fiona.

14:04.080 --> 14:05.040
Let's do it.

14:09.840 --> 14:10.920
Dr.  Campbell,

14:11.200 --> 14:14.200
the other officer has just been
taken to the operating room.

14:16.160 --> 14:17.120
Good.

14:20.160 --> 14:21.600
-Is vascular advice needed?
-Yes.

14:21.720 --> 14:24.080
The lupus patient came
here with the onset of fainting.

14:24.200 --> 14:26.240
The kidney status is
deteriorating, she needs dialysis.

14:26.480 --> 14:27.920
Lupus?
When did you get your diagnosis?

14:28.280 --> 14:30.400
Eight years ago, right
after my son was born.

14:30.800 --> 14:32.760
I had a couple of flare-ups
but it was controllable.

14:32.960 --> 14:35.400
Mom!  Will you get well again?

14:36.800 --> 14:38.200
Uncle Tim said you
weren't feeling well.

14:38.440 --> 14:40.160
Honey, I'm fine

14:40.400 --> 14:42.120
Honey, I'm fine

14:42.360 --> 14:43.960
What's that, Tim?

14:44.160 --> 14:45.200
What have i done now

14:45.360 --> 14:46.880
You should pick him

14:47.000 --> 14:49.040
up, not bring him here!

14:49.360 --> 14:51.480
Sorry, we need to
close the investigation.

14:51.720 --> 14:53.200
We need a complete blood
count with a coagulation test.

14:53.400 --> 14:56.560
We want to see if your
electrolyte levels are okay...

14:56.760 --> 14:58.640
This may make your
mom feel a little dizzy.

15:00.360 --> 15:01.840
What's wrong with you?

15:03.400 --> 15:05.680
Lupus is wrong with
me, do you remember?

15:07.480 --> 15:09.760
We'll get a sister
to do the tests.

15:10.080 --> 15:13.200
It'll take a while,
I'll go to the

15:13.320 --> 15:14.280
cafeteria and get a sandwich.

15:14.400 --> 15:16.280
Are you high?

15:16.760 --> 15:18.360
No, hungry.

15:18.760 --> 15:21.320
Why did you call  Did none
of the "mothers" answer?

15:23.520 --> 15:25.280
Julia, lie down again.

15:25.440 --> 15:26.560
Moment.  Is she
going to be okay?

15:26.720 --> 15:28.320
If everything was all right,
I wouldn't be here, Tim.

15:31.640 --> 15:33.240
I'll get the sister.

15:34.400 --> 15:35.680
Mom?

15:35.960 --> 15:37.240
It's okay.

15:38.640 --> 15:39.880
Do you see that knot, Johnny?

15:40.200 --> 15:42.520
This is a mediastinal tumor.

15:45.840 --> 15:48.800
You look like you've been
in the seventh circle of hell.

15:50.800 --> 15:53.040
You have difficulty breathing
because of the tumor.

15:54.680 --> 15:57.760
Have you ever heard of
the "Ambitious Card" trick?

15:58.880 --> 16:02.400
In 1922 a card artist
named Dai Vernon deceived

16:02.680 --> 16:05.200
with this trick the
unique Houdini who

16:05.360 --> 16:07.320
said that he saw
through every illusion,

16:07.440 --> 16:09.080
if he has seen her three times.

16:09.240 --> 16:11.080
Johnny, we're going to
get started right away.

16:11.240 --> 16:12.920
You may feel a bit
of a tweak, right?

16:14.840 --> 16:18.800
So Houdini is sitting at the
Great Northern Hotel in Chicago.

16:19.520 --> 16:22.640
The 27 year old Canadian
wants him to have his initials

16:22.920 --> 16:24.520
writes on the ace of clubs...

16:24.800 --> 16:26.160
Hold still.

16:26.840 --> 16:30.040
Dr.  Savetti, thread the
needle into the liquid.

16:33.640 --> 16:34.600
I agree.

16:38.800 --> 16:42.080
Johnny, the liquid
looks rather cloudy.

16:42.360 --> 16:45.880
With the lump in the breast,
it appears to be cancer.

16:50.800 --> 16:52.280
We need to do a biopsy, yeah?

16:55.040 --> 16:56.120
Initials.

16:58.640 --> 17:01.000
It is important that you
understand what we are saying.

17:01.200 --> 17:02.680
It is likely that you...

17:02.880 --> 17:04.560
...To have cancer.  Yes.

17:05.240 --> 17:09.240
What are my chances?
I like math.

17:10.200 --> 17:11.599
Ninety-nine percent.

17:12.280 --> 17:13.480
I'm so sorry.

17:14.319 --> 17:15.440
It doesn't have to be.

17:15.880 --> 17:17.560
One percent chance of success.

17:18.440 --> 17:19.640
That's a good trick.

17:20.319 --> 17:21.400
Put them back.

17:24.480 --> 17:26.440
Did Vernon outsmart Houdini?

17:26.800 --> 17:27.760
He did.

17:28.079 --> 17:33.040
He tapped the deck and
Houdini's marked card

17:33.280 --> 17:34.640
jumped straight to the top.

17:34.920 --> 17:37.240
Houdini asked
him to do it again.

17:37.520 --> 17:38.480
Vernon did.

17:39.520 --> 17:40.640
Seven times.

17:49.480 --> 17:53.360
Sometimes you just get
dealt the wrong cards.

17:54.360 --> 17:56.320
Yes, I know the feeling.

17:57.360 --> 18:01.720
But it just depends on
how you play the cards

18:02.920 --> 18:04.560
that you get.

18:08.120 --> 18:09.160
How did you do that?

18:12.200 --> 18:13.360
Do you believe in sorcery?

18:14.680 --> 18:15.640
Not today.

18:16.400 --> 18:19.760
You have to believe, I
use magic to outwit death.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.680
Nobody touches my nose until

18:23.800 --> 18:25.360
I see a licensed
plastic surgeon.

18:25.640 --> 18:27.720
Dr.  Silverman is the
best on the west side.

18:27.920 --> 18:29.120
Xander, tell her!

18:32.040 --> 18:33.800
Are you all right, Xander?

18:35.360 --> 18:36.680
The blood pressure dropped slightly.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.240
Has he complained
of chest pain or fever?

18:39.360 --> 18:40.600
Is he taking new medication?

18:41.480 --> 18:43.120
Just... gingko biloba.

18:43.280 --> 18:45.040
He had trouble memorizing
the marriage vows.

18:45.240 --> 18:46.600
What happened
right before the fall?

18:46.720 --> 18:48.240
Anything unusual?

18:48.600 --> 18:49.880
We had sex three times.

18:51.040 --> 18:52.120
That's not normal.

18:54.680 --> 18:56.320
Did he take sexual enhancers?

18:56.480 --> 18:58.440
You mean the blue pills?

18:58.600 --> 18:59.360
No.

19:01.400 --> 19:03.600
Not that I know of... Xander?

19:05.800 --> 19:07.760
He collapses.
The blood pressure drops rapidly.

19:08.120 --> 19:09.920
It can be heart
failure, sepsis, a clot...

19:10.040 --> 19:11.240
I add a liter of norepinephrine?

19:11.360 --> 19:12.640
I create an access
for vasopressors...

19:12.760 --> 19:13.720
Thank you.

19:13.840 --> 19:15.200
Heart failure?  Xander?

19:15.440 --> 19:16.400
Xander!

19:26.000 --> 19:27.560
Do you smoke weed?

19:29.880 --> 19:32.160
Yes, that's okay.
I have a prescription so...

19:32.360 --> 19:33.320
Glaucoma?

19:34.160 --> 19:36.560
Insomnia.  Nightmares.

19:36.760 --> 19:37.880
Nightmares?

19:38.480 --> 19:40.320
Is my sister sending you?

19:40.520 --> 19:42.000
Maybe she wants to
continue to finish me off.

19:42.120 --> 19:43.400
It won't help you.

19:43.520 --> 19:44.840
Silently condemn me.

19:45.480 --> 19:46.880
She's really good at that.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.920
She likes to see me
as a losing brother

19:50.120 --> 19:51.080
and blames me for everything

19:51.280 --> 19:52.600
Then she feels better.

19:52.880 --> 19:55.320
Your sister is not
feeling well right now.

19:55.920 --> 19:57.080
Damn.

19:59.440 --> 20:00.800
She's been through worse.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.480
Do you believe me okay?
We both have that.

20:04.280 --> 20:06.240
I know she got this lupus thing

20:06.360 --> 20:07.680
that she says she's
got it under control.

20:07.800 --> 20:08.760
So what?

20:12.080 --> 20:13.560
What?  Is she lying?

20:14.200 --> 20:16.720
I can't talk about
your sister's condition.

20:18.480 --> 20:21.480
But I can tell you when
my brother was sick

20:23.720 --> 20:25.920
I learned everything I could.

20:36.520 --> 20:37.960
How long have
you been with Eric?

20:39.200 --> 20:40.440
We are not.

20:43.640 --> 20:45.520
I have been transferred
to a different unit.

20:46.360 --> 20:48.560
We wanted to wait and
see before we made it public.

20:49.520 --> 20:50.720
A rule breaker?

20:52.680 --> 20:53.960
You could say so.

20:55.680 --> 20:56.640
Dr.  Willis?

20:58.040 --> 20:59.360
How are you?

20:59.720 --> 21:02.680
It shouldn't be long now.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.960
Ask how Eric is doing.

21:09.720 --> 21:11.920
He's waiting to see you.

21:14.280 --> 21:15.520
I see the bullet.

21:18.480 --> 21:19.440
Fiona?

21:19.600 --> 21:20.720
Fiona, stay awake...

21:20.840 --> 21:22.720
Talk to me, Ethan.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.120
The ball moved.

21:24.400 --> 21:26.320
She wounded her femoral artery.

21:28.640 --> 21:30.520
Don't come in here.

21:34.240 --> 21:35.520
Doc, stop!

21:37.320 --> 21:38.280
Put that on.

21:44.200 --> 21:45.320
Thank you.

21:48.200 --> 21:49.280
What the fuck are you doing

21:49.520 --> 21:51.200
Wherever you go, I go too.

21:51.400 --> 21:53.040
Jesse, you don't have to do this.

21:53.160 --> 21:56.000
If I didn't, you'd keep
talking about it.  Come on.

21:57.240 --> 21:59.800
Did any of you
hear what I just said?

21:59.920 --> 22:01.840
You like to say it

22:02.040 --> 22:03.360
we don't work for you.

22:04.080 --> 22:05.240
You say it daddy

22:05.840 --> 22:07.120
Campbell won't like this.

22:07.840 --> 22:08.920
He might fire us.

22:09.360 --> 22:10.720
When this ball moves again

22:11.680 --> 22:13.680
there won't be
much left to fire.

22:16.600 --> 22:18.480
Dr.  Pinkney thinks you need a

22:18.600 --> 22:20.280
CT scan to rule
out a few things.

22:20.440 --> 22:21.760
What?

22:22.080 --> 22:24.240
A clot, tear, or
aortic dilation.

22:24.920 --> 22:25.880
That sounds bad.

22:28.760 --> 22:29.720
You are here.

22:29.840 --> 22:33.200
Good.  Can you bring
him to Andrea overnight?

22:33.360 --> 22:35.920
Hey, get your
backpack, okay buddy?

22:42.640 --> 22:44.120
You're sicker than
you told me, aren't you?

22:45.280 --> 22:46.240
No.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.280
Stop lying to me, okay?  Say...

22:49.680 --> 22:51.080
I dont lie.

22:51.280 --> 22:52.520
Now is not the time.

22:52.640 --> 22:54.400
We need to get you
to radiology really fast.

22:54.520 --> 22:58.000
As you always tell
me, silence is also a lie.

22:58.760 --> 23:01.040
I have the right to
know, so please, yes?

23:03.160 --> 23:04.600
Sorry  It's really tough.

23:04.720 --> 23:07.360
Do you have the right to know?

23:07.480 --> 23:09.160
You have the right to know

23:10.640 --> 23:13.120
Knowing if I'm losing
my second sister.

23:15.360 --> 23:16.480
So you do remember
her after all.

23:17.320 --> 23:19.920
Because that's the first
time you mention her in years.

23:20.080 --> 23:23.160
First time I mentioned
her to you, Jules.

23:23.600 --> 23:24.920
What does that mean?

23:25.280 --> 23:26.240
What does this mean?

23:26.360 --> 23:27.480
Do you have to die or not?

23:29.600 --> 23:30.560
Tim, behind you...

23:32.080 --> 23:34.160
God.  Ronny, buddy...

23:34.320 --> 23:35.680
Mom...

23:36.080 --> 23:37.040
Cutie pie.

23:37.360 --> 23:38.920
Stay away from my son, right?

23:39.040 --> 23:40.320
Do you see?  It is.

23:40.560 --> 23:42.680
You can't trust Tim
with children, can you?

23:42.960 --> 23:44.280
You have to protect her, huh?

23:44.400 --> 23:45.760
I didn't mean that, Tim.

23:48.800 --> 23:50.000
Sorry

23:55.200 --> 23:56.560
How are you?

23:56.800 --> 23:58.560
She is... slow.

24:00.160 --> 24:01.360
Slow is good.

24:01.880 --> 24:03.080
Maybe for us.

24:03.200 --> 24:04.240
She's still bleeding.

24:05.240 --> 24:06.200
I have it.

24:06.320 --> 24:07.600
Do we disconnect or do we mend?

24:07.840 --> 24:08.800
Clamps.

24:09.360 --> 24:11.560
We'll mend it as soon as
we get the thing out of her.

24:12.680 --> 24:13.640
How is eric

24:14.600 --> 24:15.760
He is stable.

24:16.440 --> 24:17.600
I don't know how much longer.

24:18.120 --> 24:19.080
They are in love.

24:20.840 --> 24:22.200
I had the same impression.

24:24.160 --> 24:25.440
Do you see what i see?

24:25.720 --> 24:27.840
The sharp tip of
an explosive bullet?

24:28.400 --> 24:29.840
I don't see that.

24:29.960 --> 24:31.560
Then you don't have
to mention that...

24:31.760 --> 24:33.880
... when the ball hits
the femur on the way...

24:34.240 --> 24:35.920
Let's stop that.

24:36.120 --> 24:38.640
I'll spin the ball

24:38.840 --> 24:42.000
so we can keep an eye
on the explosive device.

24:42.400 --> 24:44.040
The muscle is pushed away.

24:55.720 --> 24:57.360
Lieutenant, it's your turn.

25:10.600 --> 25:11.840
Willis, there's blood in the cavity.

25:12.080 --> 25:14.720
That still has to be a rupture of the vessel.

25:15.040 --> 25:16.840
She's bleeding.

25:17.880 --> 25:19.000
Mom, add another unit.

25:19.120 --> 25:20.280
We need the operating room.

25:20.880 --> 25:21.960
Let's bring her up.

25:22.200 --> 25:24.080
-How is Eric doing?
-He is well.

25:24.200 --> 25:25.080
How is she doing?

25:25.280 --> 25:27.120
We clamped off
the femoral artery,

25:27.240 --> 25:28.240
we have to mend it extensively.

25:28.360 --> 25:29.320
It's too torn.

25:31.240 --> 25:32.240
Dr.  Willis.

25:33.480 --> 25:34.840
Get dressed and help me.

25:35.120 --> 25:37.320
You should see this
through to the end.

25:42.360 --> 25:43.640
So, Johnny, ready for surgery?

25:45.600 --> 25:46.840
The better question
is are everyone

25:46.960 --> 25:50.440
ready to see the power and shine

25:50.560 --> 25:51.520
which means real magic?

25:52.360 --> 25:53.720
They'll do a biopsy.

25:54.120 --> 25:57.840
You like to be the knife in
the balloon of life, don't you?

25:59.960 --> 26:01.160
What about you?

26:02.160 --> 26:05.720
Do you think the
tumor is benign?

26:06.240 --> 26:07.200
I hope so.

26:07.920 --> 26:10.120
Some hope, some faith.

26:10.440 --> 26:11.760
I do not need more.

26:12.080 --> 26:13.040
We should go.

26:13.160 --> 26:15.480
You two are perfect
for each other.

26:17.440 --> 26:18.880
Do you have time
for one last trick?

26:19.160 --> 26:20.120
Think of a card.

26:20.360 --> 26:22.760
No come on
Concentrate properly.

26:23.480 --> 26:24.440
Dr.  Savetti.

26:24.560 --> 26:25.520
The map.

26:27.080 --> 26:28.040
OK.

26:29.120 --> 26:30.440
Seven of clubs.

26:30.600 --> 26:31.560
Seven of clubs.

26:37.720 --> 26:39.400
Seven of clubs.

26:41.320 --> 26:42.840
Come on, little one.
Give it a try.

26:44.360 --> 26:45.680
The Queen of Hearts.

26:46.040 --> 26:48.280
The Queen of Hearts.

26:55.720 --> 26:58.600
Well, I'm still working on it.

26:58.800 --> 27:00.320
Perfect.

27:00.440 --> 27:02.160
Does it hurt when you breathe in?

27:02.680 --> 27:04.920
Yes, I am short of breath.

27:05.160 --> 27:09.320
Well, we'll give you more
oxygen and other medicines.

27:09.440 --> 27:11.600
-Uncle Tim.
-Hey buddy.

27:11.760 --> 27:13.640
You're back?

27:17.520 --> 27:19.960
Ronny, why don't
you play your game?

27:25.440 --> 27:27.600
It was my idea.

27:29.080 --> 27:30.040
What?

27:31.960 --> 27:33.200
That day with Leah.

27:34.480 --> 27:36.200
I wanted to swim to
the docks with her.

27:37.640 --> 27:40.440
First I swam slowly

27:40.760 --> 27:43.040
and I kept an eye on her.

27:43.200 --> 27:44.160
But...

27:47.000 --> 27:48.480
I just wanted to win.

27:50.840 --> 27:53.480
I swam across the
lake as fast as I could

27:54.840 --> 27:56.400
and when I looked back

27:58.080 --> 27:59.280
she was gone.

28:00.400 --> 28:01.600
It was my fault.

28:02.880 --> 28:03.840
Jules.

28:04.840 --> 28:05.800
It was my fault.

28:07.560 --> 28:08.960
And every day that I live

28:09.160 --> 28:11.080
I borrowed it at their expense.

28:14.040 --> 28:15.000
Tim...

28:21.680 --> 28:23.280
It's not your fault.

28:27.040 --> 28:28.480
I loved her.

28:30.680 --> 28:33.840
I loved her like him,
you know that, don't you?

28:35.360 --> 28:36.800
I know.

28:40.440 --> 28:43.000
You are a great uncle.

28:47.080 --> 28:48.800
And you are my favorite brother.

28:51.400 --> 28:53.360
I have a kind of monopoly.

28:57.320 --> 28:59.360
Julia, we just got
the CT results.

29:00.040 --> 29:01.360
It's a major pulmonary embolism.

29:01.560 --> 29:02.640
What is that supposed to mean?

29:02.760 --> 29:04.080
That means an operation, immediately.

29:13.920 --> 29:15.280
It was in his hand
the whole time.

29:15.800 --> 29:17.920
No, I saw the hand.
It was empty.

29:18.160 --> 29:19.520
Are you telling me
he can do magic?

29:19.640 --> 29:20.600
I did not say that.

29:20.800 --> 29:22.160
I just haven't
figured it out yet.

29:24.920 --> 29:26.360
You lost a patient today.

29:27.600 --> 29:28.560
Are you all right?

29:30.320 --> 29:32.760
It was crazy out there.
I've never seen anything like it.

29:34.080 --> 29:35.280
He prayed.

29:38.200 --> 29:42.120
He asked me to tell his
wife that he loved her.

29:43.760 --> 29:44.720
I did not do it.

29:47.000 --> 29:47.960
I got scared.

29:48.720 --> 29:49.680
Happens.

29:50.000 --> 29:50.960
She is pregnant.

29:51.640 --> 29:53.160
She will raise the
baby without a father

29:53.520 --> 29:55.080
and I didn't have the
courage to tell her everything.

29:57.480 --> 29:58.600
What does that say about me?

30:00.120 --> 30:01.320
It's not too late yet.

30:02.320 --> 30:03.880
Call her.  Write her a letter.

30:06.680 --> 30:08.440
The longer I've been a doctor,

30:08.560 --> 30:10.440
the more I believe in miracles.

30:11.960 --> 30:12.920
Or sorcery.

30:13.640 --> 30:14.600
What's this?

30:14.840 --> 30:16.640
The result of Johnny's biopsy.

30:17.800 --> 30:18.760
It's not cancer.

30:19.320 --> 30:20.280
You are joking.

30:21.880 --> 30:23.280
Ninety-nine to one.

30:23.680 --> 30:25.120
The man decided it himself.

30:36.400 --> 30:38.360
Dr.  Pinkney, is
everything okay over there?

30:38.480 --> 30:39.880
I now tie up the aortic cannula.

30:40.040 --> 30:42.240
In a few minutes we'll be
ready for cardiac bypass.

30:42.560 --> 30:45.720
I'll help with the embolectomy
as soon as you're done.

30:45.960 --> 30:49.040
She has a heart attack!  Quick,
the paddles, recharge to 50.

30:49.160 --> 30:50.880
Are you going.  I do that.

30:57.360 --> 30:58.520
What do we have?

30:58.680 --> 31:00.840
She has ventricular fibrillation.
I shock her again.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.320
Give her 1 mg Epi.

31:02.440 --> 31:03.400
Shock them again!

31:03.720 --> 31:04.680
Step away!

31:07.440 --> 31:08.560
She is in cardiac arrest

31:08.800 --> 31:09.920
start resuscitation.

31:18.960 --> 31:21.440
I did everything.  I am sure.

31:22.320 --> 31:23.480
The embolism was too big.

31:23.600 --> 31:25.160
There was nothing
you could have done.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.320
Declare them dead.

31:35.640 --> 31:37.640
Time of death is 3:47 p.m.

31:39.080 --> 31:41.840
Dr.  Willis, how is Fiona?

31:42.560 --> 31:43.520
Good.

31:44.040 --> 31:45.640
I'll close if that's okay.

31:47.720 --> 31:48.960
I tell her brother.

32:00.200 --> 32:01.160
Mr. Clark?

32:01.280 --> 32:02.880
Is she out of the operating room yet?

32:04.440 --> 32:05.400
Not yet.

32:10.400 --> 32:14.960
Hey Rons.  Will you
get us two limos, buddy?

32:15.200 --> 32:16.600
-Yes, of course.
-Yes?

32:26.040 --> 32:27.000
You're kidding, aren't you?

32:39.000 --> 32:39.960
She is dead.

32:41.360 --> 32:44.120
There was a big clot in her
lung, her heart collapsed.

32:44.800 --> 32:47.720
This can happen with lupus,
despite the best treatment.

32:48.160 --> 32:49.120
Tim, it...

32:50.840 --> 32:52.320
I'm really sorry.

32:55.440 --> 32:59.320
What will happen to Ronny now?

32:59.480 --> 33:01.200
What will happen to him?

33:01.320 --> 33:02.840
Where will he go

33:03.000 --> 33:05.160
Well, she thought of it.

33:06.960 --> 33:09.000
She recorded this right
before the operation.

33:13.640 --> 33:15.280
Hey tim

33:17.880 --> 33:19.320
I am doing this officially.

33:23.160 --> 33:25.800
If I should die, I'll
transfer Julia Clark

33:27.360 --> 33:29.720
the guardianship of my son,

33:31.080 --> 33:32.200
Ronald clark,

33:33.240 --> 33:34.400
to my brother Timothy.

33:39.880 --> 33:40.840
Tim...

33:41.760 --> 33:44.160
There is only one way
to be a good parent.

33:47.240 --> 33:49.840
All you have to do is love
the child with all your heart.

33:53.400 --> 33:55.640
But you already have
the monopoly on that.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.320
What happened to Leah

34:06.120 --> 34:08.080
wasn't your fault.

34:09.560 --> 34:11.080
You have to start
believing that.

34:13.120 --> 34:14.080
Because I believe that.

34:18.440 --> 34:19.400
So don't be scared.

34:22.199 --> 34:23.520
I love you, button.

34:34.600 --> 34:36.080
I love you too, Jules.

35:02.480 --> 35:03.840
I thought I lost you

35:04.280 --> 35:06.080
You won't get rid
of me that easily.

35:09.160 --> 35:10.480
God are you alright baby

35:16.040 --> 35:17.760
I will get well again.

35:18.000 --> 35:18.960
We both.

35:19.120 --> 35:20.200
I love you.

35:20.480 --> 35:21.720
Say that again.

35:23.200 --> 35:24.160
I love you.

35:27.680 --> 35:28.880
I love you too.

35:36.760 --> 35:38.240
Fortunately that went well.

35:38.920 --> 35:41.800
We were still missing
a sharp artillery here.

35:42.120 --> 35:44.200
"Potency pills," Xander?
Really now?

35:44.360 --> 35:47.160
I wanted to give you
the best night of your life.

35:47.400 --> 35:49.800
You had so much
stress about the wedding.

35:49.920 --> 35:51.720
I didn't have any stress.

35:51.840 --> 35:53.680
You fired six florists.

35:53.840 --> 35:55.600
Sue me for wanting
everything perfect.

35:58.040 --> 35:59.040
I'm so sorry.

35:59.920 --> 36:01.160
You're right.

36:01.400 --> 36:02.680
I also want everything
to be perfect.

36:02.840 --> 36:04.280
I took dance lessons
twice a week so I wouldn't

36:04.440 --> 36:06.800
look like an idiot in
front of your family.

36:07.400 --> 36:08.920
The train has left, dude.

36:09.640 --> 36:10.600
Do not listen to him.

36:11.560 --> 36:12.800
You are not an idiot.

36:12.920 --> 36:13.960
You married me

36:15.080 --> 36:16.680
I love you husband

36:16.840 --> 36:18.240
I love you wife

36:18.360 --> 36:20.200
I can't wait to get
to know your kids.

36:20.440 --> 36:21.840
Hopefully we never will.

36:24.600 --> 36:26.680
Do you want to know
how I come up with tricks?

36:26.800 --> 36:27.760
-Yes.
-I think

36:28.160 --> 36:31.640
an unsolvable
problem, then I hit my

36:31.760 --> 36:33.920
head against the
wall until it goes away,

36:34.040 --> 36:36.200
and then the answer is there.

36:36.320 --> 36:38.640
Just take a card.
Please take it.

36:38.960 --> 36:40.720
We both seem to
be of the same age.

36:40.880 --> 36:42.200
Do you know bob dylan?

36:42.960 --> 36:43.920
I mix it up briefly.

36:44.080 --> 36:45.320
The card you picked was the...

36:48.480 --> 36:52.840
Three of Diamonds.

36:53.080 --> 36:54.440
Is that correct?

36:57.120 --> 36:58.240
The Nobel Prize Winner

36:58.440 --> 37:03.520
Bob Dylan said, "You
should never attain a

37:03.680 --> 37:06.680
state, you must always
be in a constant state

37:08.520 --> 37:12.400
of becoming. "

37:12.720 --> 37:13.840
How did you do that?

37:14.240 --> 37:15.200
Cool.

37:19.080 --> 37:21.640
Unimaginable to be in
a world without magic.

37:21.880 --> 37:22.840
A world without hope.

37:23.080 --> 37:24.040
Remember during the dark times

37:25.640 --> 37:27.320
is it important for all of us

37:27.600 --> 37:30.440
conjure up a little magic.

37:38.240 --> 37:39.400
Dr.  Kean.

37:40.400 --> 37:41.920
What's that in your bag?

37:45.240 --> 37:46.200
The front.

37:55.200 --> 37:56.160
A queen of hearts.

37:58.520 --> 37:59.640
How did you do that?

37:59.840 --> 38:01.160
Why are you asking that?

38:01.640 --> 38:02.960
Because I want to know it.

38:03.080 --> 38:04.800
You don’t want to know.
They want evidence.

38:05.680 --> 38:07.080
If I don't tell you

38:07.760 --> 38:09.200
all you have left is faith.

38:10.760 --> 38:11.960
Evidence is simple.

38:12.320 --> 38:14.600
Faith is damn hard work.

38:17.960 --> 38:19.240
Or, Dr.  Guthrie?

38:20.360 --> 38:21.440
Absolutely.

38:41.960 --> 38:43.560
Hello, is Mrs. Hall there?

38:45.600 --> 38:47.000
My name is dr.  Kean.

38:47.520 --> 38:48.480
Noa.

38:50.760 --> 38:52.960
I was with your
husband when he died...

39:04.760 --> 39:06.920
We had a tradition
in Afghanistan.

39:08.160 --> 39:10.640
After a hard day,
we met on the roof

39:11.720 --> 39:12.920
and smoked a cigar.

39:15.360 --> 39:16.560
You kept your promise.

39:18.000 --> 39:18.960
We.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.080
Caught.
