        Dr. Arthur strauss.

00:02.636 --> 00:04.703
        He was a counselor
        at the boarding school

00:04.705 --> 00:05.904
        That joe went to
        in new hampshire.

00:05.906 --> 00:07.473
Ryan: You're the one
that taught joe.

00:07.475 --> 00:08.307
        I inspired him.

00:08.309 --> 00:10.075
            I want to sanction
            you off the books.

00:10.077 --> 00:11.777
            I know you want to
            find carroll.

00:11.779 --> 00:12.544
            Let me help you.

00:12.546 --> 00:13.712
        Emma: What kind
        of cult is this?

00:13.714 --> 00:16.682
Carroll: Roderick identified
them as a vulnerable group.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.951
        I need your help.
        I want to kill people.

00:18.953 --> 00:20.019
                You have a plan?

00:20.021 --> 00:21.620
I have an epic plan.

00:21.622 --> 00:25.424
Mike: Jana, I need you
to stay where you are.

00:25.426 --> 00:26.759
            No, no!

00:26.761 --> 00:27.960
You find anything?

00:27.962 --> 00:29.828
    Micah: I've decided
    to add lance

00:29.830 --> 00:31.163
    To accompany you two
        to new york.

00:31.165 --> 00:33.832
Emma: It's for a friend--
joe carroll.

00:33.834 --> 00:35.100
            You're going to
            help us!

00:35.102 --> 00:37.102
            Share this
            with the world,
            and if you don't,

00:37.104 --> 00:38.203
            We will come for you

00:38.205 --> 00:40.305
            And everyone you
            care about.

00:40.307 --> 00:42.107
Can I help you?

Man on tv: A live exclusive
from carrie cooke,

00:45.646 --> 00:47.279
Who was inside today's
bookstore massacre.

00:47.281 --> 00:48.480
    Micah: Here we go,
    here we go.

00:48.482 --> 00:49.848
    Carrie: During the attack,
        I was given

00:49.850 --> 00:51.016
    The following video
        and told

00:51.018 --> 00:52.317
        To share it
        with the world.

00:52.319 --> 00:53.385
        Carroll on tv:
        Hello, world.

00:53.387 --> 00:54.953
        I hope I have
        your attention.

00:54.955 --> 00:56.221
What the hell?

00:56.223 --> 00:58.557
        I am joe carroll.

00:58.559 --> 00:59.391
Shh, shh, shh.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.794
        You will never
        feel safe again.

01:01.796 --> 01:02.928
        Praise joe!

01:02.930 --> 01:04.263
Praise joe!

01:04.265 --> 01:05.297

01:20.414 --> 01:22.081
Pressure's dropping!

01:22.083 --> 01:23.315
            She's bleeding out!

01:23.317 --> 01:25.784
I have no pressure.

01:33.827 --> 01:35.761

01:42.035 --> 01:45.571
Hey. Claire.

01:45.573 --> 01:46.405
            Mike.

01:46.407 --> 01:47.840
It's ok, it's ok.

01:47.842 --> 01:49.174
Take it easy.

01:49.176 --> 01:50.275
You were stabbed.

01:50.277 --> 01:52.111
Your lung was punctured,
but you were lucky.

01:52.113 --> 01:53.078
You're gonna be ok.

01:53.080 --> 01:54.947
            Ryan? He was hurt.
            Where is ryan?

01:54.949 --> 01:57.716
He's in surgery.
He's gonna be ok, too.

01:57.718 --> 01:59.184
            And joey?

01:59.186 --> 02:00.752
He's with your mom.

02:00.754 --> 02:03.755
He's safe. It's ok.

02:03.757 --> 02:05.691
            [moans]

02:08.394 --> 02:10.696
Saw joe on tv.

02:10.698 --> 02:13.565
He's alive?

02:13.567 --> 02:17.302
How is that possible?

02:17.304 --> 02:19.905
    We need to protect
    you and joey.

02:19.907 --> 02:21.273
            You want me to go
            into hiding.

02:21.275 --> 02:23.542
    Witness protection.
    We'll relocate you,

02:23.544 --> 02:24.510
    Joey, and your mother,

02:24.512 --> 02:26.078
        We'll give you
        new identities.

02:26.080 --> 02:29.481
            I just give up
            my life?

02:29.483 --> 02:31.183
            Mike.

02:31.185 --> 02:34.386
It's the best way
to protect you and joey.

02:34.388 --> 02:35.787
            I need to talk
            to ryan.

02:35.789 --> 02:38.090
    Look. For this to work,
    everyone has to believe

02:38.092 --> 02:39.358
    You died in the o.R.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.226
    This place is already
    crawling with reporters.

02:41.228 --> 02:42.961
    We can't risk anyone
        seeing you.

02:42.963 --> 02:44.563
    We have to get you
    out of here now.

02:44.565 --> 02:45.964
            I can't even tell
            ryan?

02:45.966 --> 02:47.099
    There's protocol, claire.

02:47.101 --> 02:48.467
    Witness protection
    won't allow it.

02:48.469 --> 02:51.003
            No! No. I have to
            tell ryan.

02:51.005 --> 02:53.472
            You're asking me
            to give up--

02:53.474 --> 02:56.208
            To give up my life.

03:03.349 --> 03:07.319
Joe's followers are
still out there, claire.

03:08.788 --> 03:13.091
Ryan would want you
and joey to be safe.

03:13.093 --> 03:16.895
            I have to tell him.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.130
You can't.

03:18.132 --> 03:18.931
            I have to.

03:18.933 --> 03:21.567
            I can't do this
            to him.

03:21.569 --> 03:22.935
            Mike, I can't.

03:22.937 --> 03:24.970
            Oh, god. Oh, god.

03:24.972 --> 03:28.941

            I--I--

03:28.943 --> 03:30.075

03:30.077 --> 03:33.045
    [heart monitor beeping]

03:45.124 --> 03:47.726
            How's claire?

04:30.570 --> 04:34.573
    Carroll: In the coming days,
    more blood will be spilled,

04:34.575 --> 04:36.275
    And nowhere will be safe,

04:36.277 --> 04:39.711
    Not behind the locked doors
        of your homes

04:39.713 --> 04:41.280
    Or in your streets,

04:41.282 --> 04:44.316
    Or--or even where you eat.

04:44.318 --> 04:49.621
        You will never
        feel safe again.

04:49.623 --> 04:50.555
            Carrie: Ryan?

04:50.557 --> 04:51.723
    Those who suppose--

04:51.725 --> 04:53.725
            Hey. Where are you?

04:53.727 --> 04:55.494
Good morning.

04:55.928 --> 04:57.596
That was very
clandestine.

04:57.598 --> 04:58.830
            Yeah, wasn't it?

04:58.832 --> 05:01.867
Is that where you
do all your secret
joe carroll stuff?

05:01.869 --> 05:04.202
            Sleep ok?

05:04.204 --> 05:06.438
Have you seen
my blouse?

05:07.073 --> 05:09.841
    I think it came off
    over here.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.710
            Oh, yeah. Right.

05:12.679 --> 05:15.213
            Your bodyguards are
            still in the hall.

05:15.215 --> 05:17.849
The walk of shame.

05:17.851 --> 05:18.650
            Coffee?

05:18.652 --> 05:19.918
No. I'm leaving.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.420
Let's not make
this weird.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.622
We both needed to
blow off some steam.

05:23.624 --> 05:25.223
This is
posttraumatic sex.

05:25.225 --> 05:26.525
        Posttraumatic sex?

05:26.527 --> 05:29.828
So really, what's
in the secret room?

05:29.830 --> 05:31.963
            It's a secret.

05:31.965 --> 05:35.000
And what are you
doing today?

05:39.105 --> 05:42.074
You are cute.

05:42.076 --> 05:44.609
You know you can
trust me, right?

05:44.611 --> 05:47.179
If you say,
"off the record,"
it's off the record.

05:47.181 --> 05:50.082
        I had a really nice
        time last night.

05:50.084 --> 05:54.152
Me, too.
It was fun.

05:59.859 --> 06:02.894
I want the story, ryan,

06:02.896 --> 06:05.564
But I also want to
help you.

06:09.736 --> 06:11.236
Carroll: Say it again.

06:11.238 --> 06:13.105
            Are you kidding?

06:13.107 --> 06:14.139
    No.

06:14.141 --> 06:15.207
            Really?

06:15.209 --> 06:17.275
Really.

06:17.277 --> 06:18.710
            Praise joe.

06:18.712 --> 06:21.513
No, no. Louder.

06:21.515 --> 06:22.581
            Come on.

06:22.583 --> 06:23.949
Really. Louder.

06:23.951 --> 06:27.753
            Praise joe!

06:27.755 --> 06:29.621
                No.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.061
Yes, mandy?

            Knock much?

06:37.064 --> 06:38.430
What is it?

06:38.432 --> 06:40.065
        Robert's looking
            for you.

06:40.067 --> 06:43.735
Ok. I'll be there
in a minute.

06:46.038 --> 06:47.839
        She barged in
        on purpose, you know?

06:47.841 --> 06:49.941
Come on. She's
feeling neglected.

06:49.943 --> 06:51.009
She needs a friend.

06:51.011 --> 06:51.943
            She needs manners.

06:51.945 --> 06:54.079
She is a girl who lost
her mother recently,

06:54.081 --> 06:57.349
So play nice, please.

06:57.351 --> 07:02.254
We need more allies here,
not less.

07:04.023 --> 07:06.191
Robert's with us,
though, yeah?

07:06.193 --> 07:07.459
            Yes. We can
            trust him.

07:07.461 --> 07:10.862
            But some others may
            need convincing.

07:10.864 --> 07:12.831
    Oh.

07:12.833 --> 07:13.832
            Joe.

07:13.834 --> 07:15.467
    Hmm?

07:17.437 --> 07:19.871
        I want you
        to promise me

07:19.873 --> 07:24.109
        That you're
        going to include me
        in decisions here.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.944
        Don't shut me out.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.979
No, no.

07:27.981 --> 07:29.915
You're my partner
in this,

07:29.917 --> 07:32.751
My high priestess.

07:35.021 --> 07:37.189
I need you.

07:47.533 --> 07:48.633
[sighs]

07:48.635 --> 07:51.136
What's going on, mike?

07:51.138 --> 07:52.771
    Joe faked his death,

07:52.773 --> 07:53.939
Started again.

07:53.941 --> 07:55.040
            With new followers?

07:55.042 --> 07:57.209
Yeah, for the most part.

07:57.211 --> 07:58.844
We killed
or apprehended

07:58.846 --> 08:01.112
All those from havenport
except for emma.

08:01.114 --> 08:03.215
            How does lily gray
            fit into all this?

08:03.217 --> 08:06.351
She's the female version
of joe, just more elusive.

08:06.353 --> 08:09.354
She's loaded with money,
international connections.

08:09.356 --> 08:10.889
We have her son
in custody,

08:10.891 --> 08:12.724
But he's not talking.

08:12.726 --> 08:17.996
            And, uh, ryan--
            how--how's he?

08:17.998 --> 08:20.332
He's good.

08:20.334 --> 08:22.767
It was hard for him,
but he pulled through

08:22.769 --> 08:24.970
Better than I--

08:25.872 --> 08:29.207
So witness protection
wants to relocate us.

08:29.209 --> 08:30.909
        Well, there's
    the strong possibility

08:30.911 --> 08:32.409
        Joe will try to find
        his son again.

08:32.412 --> 08:33.979
Well, I don't want
to keep running.

08:33.981 --> 08:35.914
            I know.
            We'll find him.

08:35.916 --> 08:38.817
My son will not be safe
until this is over.

08:38.818 --> 08:40.919
I don't want to
find him.

08:40.921 --> 08:43.321
I want to kill him.

08:50.062 --> 08:51.663
So these are
the psychos.

08:51.665 --> 08:54.266
No need to be
quite so pejorative, emma.

08:54.268 --> 08:56.301
            I think these people
            are going to be

08:56.303 --> 08:57.502
            Very useful to us.

08:57.504 --> 08:59.638
    Robert: Patrick is
    former military.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.039
            He was
    dishonorably discharged

09:01.041 --> 09:03.308
        For torturing
        iraqi civilians.

09:03.310 --> 09:04.709
    Tilda's spent a year
    in the mental hospital

09:04.711 --> 09:06.645
    For sticking a knife
    in her brother.

09:06.647 --> 09:10.715
            Oh. Well,
            brothers can be
            most irritating.

09:10.717 --> 09:11.950
            What about
            the pretty boy?

09:11.952 --> 09:13.985
    That's lucas, one
    of our security guards.

09:13.987 --> 09:18.356
    He's smart, well-trained,
    and a total narcissist.

09:18.358 --> 09:19.658
            Hmm. And the other?

09:19.660 --> 09:21.893
            She seems somewhat
            melancholy.

09:21.895 --> 09:25.497
    That's mallory,
    lance's girlfriend.

09:25.499 --> 09:28.066
He never made it back
from the bookstore.

09:28.068 --> 09:31.169
            Oh, right, yes, yes.
            Lance.

09:31.171 --> 09:32.370
    She's light on ability,

09:32.372 --> 09:33.638
    But she is not squeamish
        around blood,

09:33.640 --> 09:36.708
    And she really wants
    to be a part of this

09:36.710 --> 09:38.343
        For lance.

09:38.345 --> 09:40.011
            Any others at all?

09:40.013 --> 09:43.114
    There aren't many more
    like thse in korban.

09:43.116 --> 09:45.951
    This is a--this is
    a new direction.

09:45.953 --> 09:51.156
    They're devoted,
    but they need
    guidance, teaching.

09:51.158 --> 09:52.123
            I see.

09:52.125 --> 09:55.226
Then they know
what's expected of them.

09:55.228 --> 09:58.129
        Yes, and I'll
        shepherd them.

09:58.131 --> 10:00.398
            You've done well,
            robert.

10:00.400 --> 10:05.770
            Oh. You've, uh,
            proven yourself
            to be invaluable.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.339
    Heh.

10:07.341 --> 10:09.274
            Excuse me.

10:18.150 --> 10:19.684
        Man: Thank you.

10:19.686 --> 10:20.852
            Special agent
            jeffrey clarke.

10:20.854 --> 10:22.287
            I'm your liaison to
            director franklin.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.122
            Anything you need
            from the fbi
            task force,

10:24.124 --> 10:25.557
            You just let
            me know.

10:25.559 --> 10:27.859
            We scoured all
            of jana murphy's
            communications.

10:27.861 --> 10:29.794
            We feel confident
            that she acted alone

10:29.796 --> 10:30.962
            In helping
            joe carroll.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.364
Has gina mendez
been cleared yet?

10:32.366 --> 10:33.898
            We believe
            murphy used
            her relationship

10:33.900 --> 10:36.434
            With agent mendez
            to gain access to
            our investigation

10:36.436 --> 10:38.236
            Without mendez's
            knowledge.

10:38.238 --> 10:39.404
            Now once she's
            recovered

10:39.406 --> 10:41.206
            And our internal
            inquiry's complete,

10:41.208 --> 10:42.841
            She'll be back
            to duty.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.909
Good.

10:44.911 --> 10:47.612
            Director franklin
            also wants me
            to tell you

10:47.614 --> 10:49.180
            That you still have
            our full support

10:49.182 --> 10:50.882
            Moving forward
            on this.

10:50.884 --> 10:52.717
            Anything--access,
            resources.

10:52.719 --> 10:56.221
            All we ask is that
            you contact me or
            franklin directly.

10:56.223 --> 10:59.391
So if anything goes wrong,
it's on me.

10:59.393 --> 11:01.292
            Something like that.

11:03.863 --> 11:06.264
That's not necessary.

11:08.901 --> 11:10.268
Why haven't you charged
strauss yet?

11:10.270 --> 11:11.936
        We've been holding off.
        Given his relationship

11:11.938 --> 11:14.839
        To joe carroll,
        we figured we'd find
        additional bodies

11:14.841 --> 11:16.174
        To pin on him.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.809
But you haven't, right?

11:17.811 --> 11:20.512
            He's too smart
            for that.

11:20.514 --> 11:22.580
What are you hoping
to get out of him?

11:22.582 --> 11:24.282
            He said he trained
            other killers.

11:24.284 --> 11:27.419
            I need to know if
            that's who joe's
            reaching out to.

11:27.421 --> 11:30.221

11:30.223 --> 11:33.124
            Ryan: Hello,
            dr. Strauss.

11:38.230 --> 11:39.964
            So, doc,

11:39.966 --> 11:43.301
            We killed one
            of joe's acolytes--

11:43.303 --> 11:47.038
            Lance tierney.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.074
            Was he one of yours?

11:49.076 --> 11:50.108
            Did you
            introduce them?

11:50.110 --> 11:51.943
When will I be able
to speak to my lawyer?

11:51.945 --> 11:53.344
            You've been careful
            for so long.

11:53.346 --> 11:56.114
            Wow! It must kill
            you to know you're
            gonna spend

11:56.116 --> 11:57.549
            The rest of your
            life in a cell

11:57.551 --> 12:00.418
            Because of joe's
            mistake.

12:01.787 --> 12:03.621
                Unh!

12:07.293 --> 12:10.428
Told you your ego
would get you in trouble.

12:10.430 --> 12:13.431
Then you show up here,
half dead,

12:13.433 --> 12:17.435
Jeopardize me
and everything I've built.

12:17.437 --> 12:18.403
            I'm sorry.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.472
When you fail this big,

12:20.474 --> 12:24.275
"I'm sorry" doesn't
cover it.

12:25.411 --> 12:28.646
You betrayed everything
I've taught you.

12:30.249 --> 12:32.050
            You used your
            medical practice

12:32.052 --> 12:33.885
            To cover up your
            murders, didn't you?

12:33.887 --> 12:35.720
            A few dead on
            the operating table.

12:35.722 --> 12:39.657
            As long as
            your death rate
            remains reasonable,

12:39.659 --> 12:41.693
            No one's
            gonna notice.

12:41.695 --> 12:42.727
            It's genius.

12:42.729 --> 12:44.262
You're appealing
to my vanity.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.197
            Is it working?

12:46.199 --> 12:50.602
What's joe done now?

12:50.604 --> 12:51.736
Oh, come now.

12:51.738 --> 12:53.438
If you want something,
you're gonna have to

12:53.440 --> 12:56.775
Give up something.

12:56.777 --> 13:00.011
        He sent followers
        to murder people
        at a book signing.

13:00.013 --> 13:03.314
Followed by a grandiose
pronouncement I'm sure.

13:03.316 --> 13:07.619
I never did quite
understand his need
for attention.

13:07.621 --> 13:11.356
The greater accomplishment
is to kill quietly, unnoticed.

13:11.358 --> 13:14.459
        Hard to see your
        student's shortcomings?

13:14.461 --> 13:17.796
And even harder
for him to admit.

13:17.798 --> 13:20.165
Does he know
you have me?

13:20.167 --> 13:23.368
He can't be happy
about that.

13:27.173 --> 13:28.940
Lance tierney?
This fool isn't

13:28.942 --> 13:31.042
The caliber of student
I'd work with.

13:31.044 --> 13:33.511
I have no idea
where joe found him.

13:33.513 --> 13:37.382
He has quite a gift
to incite obsession

13:37.384 --> 13:41.252
And attract followers.

13:43.289 --> 13:45.757
Like you.

13:45.759 --> 13:47.625
Look at you.

13:47.627 --> 13:50.795
Perfect example
of obsession.

13:50.797 --> 13:55.400
You stole his wife,
wrote a book about him,

13:55.402 --> 13:58.169
Became a teacher
like he was.

13:58.171 --> 14:01.639
            Well, when you
            say it out loud.

14:01.641 --> 14:03.408
Did you know that
one of the many traits
of a psychopath

14:03.410 --> 14:06.010
Is to mirror
another's behavior?

14:06.012 --> 14:09.514
You have no life
of your own.

14:09.516 --> 14:13.051
So you copy
someone else's.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.361

I'm sorry,
but I disagree.

14:23.363 --> 14:26.164
            Joey is not
            gonna have a life
            until joe is gone.

14:26.166 --> 14:27.832
            I don't have a life.

14:27.834 --> 14:31.035
Joe thinks you're dead.
It has to stay that way.

14:31.037 --> 14:32.570
Do you remember
how many people
died last year,

14:32.572 --> 14:33.905
How many women
named claire matthews?

14:33.907 --> 14:35.673
You want to live
through that again?

14:35.675 --> 14:36.908
            I can be of help
            to you.

14:36.910 --> 14:39.377
Yes, you can,
by going home
to your son.

14:39.379 --> 14:40.945
I came here
to fill you in,
and I did.

14:40.947 --> 14:42.080
I told you
everything I know,

14:42.082 --> 14:44.082
But now you have to
cooperate.

14:44.084 --> 14:47.252
Just go home.

14:51.690 --> 14:55.126
Take care
of yourself, claire.

on your offer.

15:07.674 --> 15:10.074
You said I could
trust you, right?

15:10.076 --> 15:13.144
            Yes, completely.
            Off the record.

15:13.146 --> 15:16.648
What if I wanted to
go on the record?

15:16.650 --> 15:19.217
            You just got my
            complete attention.

    You know, god's own son
    was--was sacrificed

    On a cross of blood
    to redeem man's sins,

15:29.329 --> 15:31.996
    But since then,
    those sins have become

    So many, they threaten
    to overwhelm us,

15:37.537 --> 15:45.143
    So surely, surely,
    new blood must be spilled.

15:45.145 --> 15:48.513
    There can be no redemption
        without blood.

No. They couldn't have.

17:46.933 --> 17:48.466
    According to my source,
    dr. Strauss is now

17:48.468 --> 17:50.735
    Cooperating fully
    with the authorities.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.937
            Mandy:
            Who's dr. Strauss?

17:52.939 --> 17:54.839
        [knock on door]

18:00.012 --> 18:01.813
            Dr. Strauss?

18:01.815 --> 18:02.680
            The, um,

18:02.682 --> 18:05.016
            The principal
            sent me.

18:05.018 --> 18:07.351
Have a seat.

18:11.990 --> 18:14.392
            Strauss: Do you know
            why you're here?

18:14.394 --> 18:17.962
Um, no, not really.

18:17.964 --> 18:21.599
You're a school counselor,
right?

18:21.601 --> 18:24.068
        I'm an alum who's
        provided guidance

18:24.070 --> 18:28.039
        To some of the school's
        wayward students.

18:28.041 --> 18:31.642
        I understand your
        parents died recently

18:31.644 --> 18:34.912
        And that your uncle
        sent you here
        from England,

18:34.914 --> 18:38.649
        Far from family
        and friends.

18:41.053 --> 18:42.820
        You took some tests
        when you started here.

18:42.822 --> 18:47.425
        The results indicated
        that you are special.

18:47.427 --> 18:49.694
        Do you know what
        psychopath means?

18:49.696 --> 18:52.697
    Carrie: His arrest is said
    to be a major step forward

18:52.699 --> 18:54.832
        In dismantling
    carroll's criminal network

18:54.834 --> 18:56.334
        And could lead
        to his capture.

18:56.336 --> 18:57.568
            Are they gonna
            find us, joe?

18:57.570 --> 18:59.070
    Strauss revealed
    that he met carroll

18:59.072 --> 19:02.206
    In the early eighties
    at lightford academy,

19:02.208 --> 19:03.774
    A boarding school, where
    the twisted serial killer...

19:03.776 --> 19:05.476
    You can't call strauss.

19:05.478 --> 19:06.811
    The fbi will trace
        the call.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.813
I'm calling jana.

19:08.815 --> 19:09.947
Her phone is protected.

19:09.949 --> 19:11.549
She'll know what to do.

19:11.551 --> 19:12.817
        Even giving them
        more insight

19:12.819 --> 19:14.852
        Into carroll's
        disturbing past.

19:14.854 --> 19:17.989
            Is that enough
            for him to call?

19:17.991 --> 19:19.357
He'll call.

19:19.359 --> 19:22.126
    [cell phone ringing]

19:27.766 --> 19:29.867
        Turn that off.

19:34.439 --> 19:35.373
        You ready?

19:35.375 --> 19:36.874
You guys set up
over there?

19:36.876 --> 19:39.143
    We're online.

19:39.145 --> 19:40.778
    Yep.

19:40.780 --> 19:43.681
Ok. Go.

19:46.451 --> 19:47.952
Jana.

19:47.954 --> 19:49.320
            Hey, joe.

19:49.322 --> 19:50.922
            It's been a while.

19:50.924 --> 19:52.557
        Talk to me, d.C.
        What do we got?

19:52.559 --> 19:54.058
The call is being routed
through the internet.

19:54.060 --> 19:56.661
I'm tracing it back
through albania.

20:02.502 --> 20:04.569
        Ryan hardy?
    Joe, joe, it's a setup!

20:04.571 --> 20:07.171
            Yeah. Your friend
            jana couldn't
            come to the phone.

20:07.173 --> 20:08.973
            Yeah. I hate
            to be the bearer
            of bad news,

20:08.975 --> 20:10.541
            But she had
            a little accident,

20:10.543 --> 20:16.247
            And by accident
            I mean a bullet went
            through her brain.

20:16.249 --> 20:18.482
Well, I expect
you're, uh--

20:18.484 --> 20:21.919
I expect you're feeling
rather clever right now.

20:21.921 --> 20:24.088
            Yeah. I have
            my moments.

20:24.090 --> 20:25.356
Tell, me ryan.
It this a, um,

20:25.358 --> 20:28.125
Keep him on the line
while we trace the call call?

20:28.127 --> 20:30.394
Because you know me
better than that.

20:30.396 --> 20:31.395
It's not gonna work.

20:31.397 --> 20:32.730
            Emma: Don't risk it.
            Hang up the phone.

20:32.732 --> 20:36.467
            Ryan: Hey. Your
            friend dr. Strauss
            says hello.

20:36.469 --> 20:39.971
Yeah. You've, um,
you've been bonding, huh?

20:39.973 --> 20:43.007
            Yeah. He's very
            disappointed
            in you, joe.

20:43.009 --> 20:44.742
Oh, dear. Well...

20:44.744 --> 20:47.111
Well, his disappointment
is about to get

20:47.113 --> 20:48.145
A whole lot worse.

20:48.147 --> 20:49.480
    Clarke: Talk to me, guys.
        Where is he?

20:49.482 --> 20:50.715
Woman: Wherever
the vpn originated,

20:50.717 --> 20:52.984
It's configured to
spread like a virus.

20:52.986 --> 20:56.287
We're in korea
and switzerland.

20:56.289 --> 20:57.121
            Why is that?

20:57.123 --> 20:58.489
Carroll: This is
not really about

20:58.491 --> 20:59.991
You and me anymore, ryan.

20:59.993 --> 21:03.794
No. It's, uh,
it's far, far more
important than that.

21:03.796 --> 21:07.498
        And I take it you
        found some new friends

21:07.500 --> 21:09.267
        Or students.

21:09.269 --> 21:11.002
Ha! You're fishing, ryan.

21:11.004 --> 21:16.040
Yes, I have found
some new disciples,

21:16.042 --> 21:20.177
Followers who are
more devoted to me than ever.

21:20.179 --> 21:23.214
No. As a matter of fact,

21:23.216 --> 21:25.016
I have a holy army
of warriors

21:25.018 --> 21:29.720
Who are about to
rain merry hell
down on this world.

21:29.722 --> 21:32.256
            A holy army, huh?

21:32.258 --> 21:33.591
            So, what, you don't
            love poe anymore?

21:33.593 --> 21:34.992
            You found a new god
            to worship?

21:34.994 --> 21:37.561
Yes, yes, ryan.
We--we no longer live

21:37.563 --> 21:40.131
In--in literature.

21:40.133 --> 21:45.403
No. I've moved on now
to the greatest story
ever told.

21:45.405 --> 21:49.273
I'm gonna save
the world, ryan,

21:49.275 --> 21:50.808
One soul at a time.

21:50.810 --> 21:54.812
So why don't you
sit down, relax,

21:54.814 --> 21:57.915
And enjoy today's show?

21:59.951 --> 22:01.986
Woman: It's gone.

22:02.454 --> 22:04.555
            [beeping]

22:05.691 --> 22:07.758
He's gone.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.468
            Ohh!

22:25.043 --> 22:26.010
Joe--

22:26.012 --> 22:28.779
            Just...

22:28.781 --> 22:31.315
            One moment.

22:41.093 --> 22:42.960
            So?

22:42.962 --> 22:44.295
He's found a new cult.

22:44.297 --> 22:46.030
            There's no way he
            built up a new crew

22:46.032 --> 22:47.031
            When he was
            in arkansas.

22:47.033 --> 22:48.432
He could have co-opted
a religious sect.

22:48.434 --> 22:51.135
Have franklin's people
look into any known
religious cults

22:51.137 --> 22:52.470
    Within a day's drive
        of new york.

22:52.472 --> 22:54.171
            You know
            the way the routed
            that phone call

22:54.173 --> 22:56.874
            To behave like
            a virus, that's
            highly unusual.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.175
        We'll find
        the origination point.

22:58.177 --> 22:59.510
        It's just gonna
        take some time.

22:59.512 --> 23:00.478
    We don't have time.

23:00.480 --> 23:03.914
        Something's
        going down today.

23:03.916 --> 23:06.250
Clarke: Ahem.

23:14.760 --> 23:16.694
    Him.

23:17.696 --> 23:18.629
Why?

23:18.631 --> 23:21.065
    Because he reminds
    me of jeff price.

23:21.067 --> 23:21.999
        Who's jeff price?

23:22.001 --> 23:23.501
    This turd in high school
        who used to

23:23.503 --> 23:24.602
    Call me wide load.

23:24.604 --> 23:27.238
    He's make beeping noises
    when I came down the hall.

23:27.240 --> 23:29.006
    I guess that's something
    you wouldn't know

23:29.008 --> 23:30.074
        Anything about.

23:30.076 --> 23:34.745
I made fun of all
the fat girls
in high school.

23:36.982 --> 23:40.384
            All right.
            Just for you.

23:40.386 --> 23:42.253
    Him.

23:43.755 --> 23:45.656
            Robert: All right.

23:55.534 --> 23:56.367
                Unh!

23:56.369 --> 23:59.403
No redemption
without blood.

24:16.321 --> 24:18.289
Nobody should ever make
you feel anything less

24:18.291 --> 24:21.158
Than beautiful, tilda.

24:35.440 --> 24:36.440
            Where you been?

24:36.442 --> 24:37.608
Went to visit my mom.

24:37.610 --> 24:39.076
            Listen. If you need
            to spend some
            more time--

24:39.078 --> 24:41.812
No. I'm good.
Clarke told me
about joe's call?

24:41.814 --> 24:45.449
    Trying to pin down
    joe's new holy army.

24:45.451 --> 24:46.917
    Lance, the dead follower
    from the bookstore

24:46.919 --> 24:48.319
        Seems like
        our best lead.

24:48.321 --> 24:50.688
Yeah. I talked
with his girlfriend's parents.

24:50.690 --> 24:53.557
Mallory hodge went
off the grid with lance
two years ago.

24:53.559 --> 24:55.125
Her parents said they
were inseparable.

24:55.127 --> 24:56.760
        She lost her job
    at a brooklyn restaurant

24:56.762 --> 24:59.063
    Because she'd
    sneak off with lance
    and miss her shifts.

24:59.065 --> 25:00.831
        Could she be part
        of the new army?

25:00.833 --> 25:02.032
            Well, nothing
            on social media,

25:02.034 --> 25:03.501
            But I'm up on her
            parents' land lines

25:03.503 --> 25:04.735
            And cell phones,
            as well as a few

25:04.737 --> 25:05.836
            Of her high school
            friends.

25:05.838 --> 25:07.805
            Maybe lance's death
            will bring her out.

25:07.807 --> 25:08.706
    You should read in.

25:08.708 --> 25:10.241
    I'll grab a transcript
        of joe's call?

25:10.243 --> 25:15.079
Thanks. Sorry I
disappeared on you guys.

25:16.214 --> 25:21.719
            Hey. You didn't
            have to lie about
            where you were.

25:21.721 --> 25:24.421
            I got worried,
            so I called your mom

25:24.423 --> 25:25.556
            To check in on you.

25:25.558 --> 25:27.157
            You weren't there.

25:27.159 --> 25:29.894
            You don't have to
            tell us where you
            are, ok,

25:29.896 --> 25:33.864
            But you don't
            have to lie
            about it either.

25:33.866 --> 25:35.566
Wait a minute.

25:35.568 --> 25:38.502
You were worried
about me?

25:45.911 --> 25:48.245
            [meow]

25:49.114 --> 25:51.115
        In our temple,

25:51.117 --> 25:53.517
    We give blood willingly

25:53.519 --> 25:57.955
    Because we know it is
    a great privilege,

25:57.957 --> 26:04.161
    But as we--we take
    the message of korban

26:04.163 --> 26:05.663
        Beyond here,

26:05.665 --> 26:09.533
        We will encounter
        those who resist.

26:09.535 --> 26:13.604
    Now they only resist
    because they do not realize

26:13.606 --> 26:17.875
    That the sacrifice
    they make will take them

26:17.877 --> 26:21.645
        To greater glory,

26:21.647 --> 26:25.816
        And when they--
        when they fight,

26:25.818 --> 26:30.287
        You must persist.

26:31.990 --> 26:36.460
        And eventually,
        there is a moment,

26:36.462 --> 26:38.729
        A moment of...

26:38.731 --> 26:39.763
        [cat yowls]

26:39.765 --> 26:41.231
        Acceptance

26:41.233 --> 26:44.268
    When they finally realize

26:44.270 --> 26:47.104
    That what you have
        given them

26:47.106 --> 26:50.574
    Is the ultimate gift.

27:01.820 --> 27:06.590
            She died a few hours
            ago in surgery.

27:06.592 --> 27:09.994
            You can touch her
            if you want.

27:23.842 --> 27:27.211
            It's a powerful
            feeling, isn't it,

27:27.213 --> 27:29.246
            Your own heart
            beating

27:29.248 --> 27:32.783
            When hers
            no longer can?

27:35.720 --> 27:39.123
            Now imagine you're
            the one responsible

27:39.125 --> 27:43.794
            For stilling
            that heart.

    Have returned to us.

39:28.900 --> 39:33.570
    Please help me
    welcome them home.

39:33.572 --> 39:36.706
        Praise them!

39:36.708 --> 39:40.043
        Praise them!

39:40.045 --> 39:41.611
        Praise them!

39:41.613 --> 39:44.547
        [cheering]

39:54.892 --> 39:56.793
            [gasps]

40:00.898 --> 40:02.866
            Death...

40:05.002 --> 40:08.371
        Is a sacred gift.

40:10.908 --> 40:14.744
    It is not to be abused
        or cheapened

40:14.746 --> 40:17.647
        But gloried.

40:24.622 --> 40:26.856
            Tilda...

40:26.858 --> 40:31.194
    And lucas have now
    been anointed.

40:31.196 --> 40:33.763
        [cheering]

40:33.765 --> 40:39.602
        Who here wishes
    to join their sacred rank?

40:39.604 --> 40:45.642
    Who wishes to become
    a harbinger of salvation?

40:45.644 --> 40:49.779
    Oh, then let
    the rivers of blood

40:49.781 --> 40:52.882
        Flow free.

40:52.884 --> 40:57.253
        Korban, embrace
        your destiny!

40:57.255 --> 41:01.157
        [cheering]

41:01.159 --> 41:03.560
        Praise korban!

41:09.333 --> 41:11.734
            We might be a while.

41:16.707 --> 41:18.942
So it didn't work.

41:18.944 --> 41:20.643
I didn't find joe.

41:20.645 --> 41:24.180
Seriously, I'm telling
you the truth.

41:24.182 --> 41:26.616
            I believe you.

41:27.151 --> 41:29.953
            But you saved
            all those people
            at the restaurant.

41:29.955 --> 41:30.987
Yeah, but--

41:30.989 --> 41:32.121
            Hey. Stop.

41:32.123 --> 41:33.389
            There's no "but."

41:33.391 --> 41:36.626
            You saved
            all those people
            at the restaurant.

41:36.628 --> 41:39.829
            That was a good
            thing you did.

41:43.100 --> 41:45.535
            And...

41:45.537 --> 41:51.608
            You actually showed
            me the smallest
            modicum of trust.

41:51.610 --> 41:54.310
            See? Another
            good thing.

41:54.312 --> 42:00.750
    Woman: ¶ 'cause they don't
    have any feelings ¶

42:00.752 --> 42:03.853
    ¶ something in the way ¶

42:03.855 --> 42:06.122
    Man on tv: There was
new carroll cult murder spree

42:06.124 --> 42:07.824
    Today on the east coast.

42:07.826 --> 42:10.627
    6 people are dead,
    including 2 cult members.

42:10.629 --> 42:11.461
Scott.

42:11.463 --> 42:16.566
    ¶ something in the way ¶

42:16.568 --> 42:18.835
        I'm not going
        back to arizona.

42:18.837 --> 42:23.106
    Look. It's not that
    simple. You don't just
    leave witness protection.

42:23.108 --> 42:24.908
I realize that,
so why don't you
get on the phone

42:24.910 --> 42:28.912
With whoever you need to?
Because I'm going
to new york.

42:31.115 --> 42:35.451
    ¶ something in the way ¶

42:35.453 --> 42:40.557
        ¶ yeah, ooh ¶

42:40.559 --> 42:45.562
    ¶ something in the way ¶

42:45.564 --> 42:50.733
        ¶ ooh, ohh ¶
