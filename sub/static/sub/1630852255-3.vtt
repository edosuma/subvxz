00:05.880 --> 00:07.215
I mean,
she's straight-up
stalking me.

00:07.298 --> 00:09.759
She lives in the bushes
outside my apartment
in Queens.

00:09.843 --> 00:12.220
She's like horny
Harriet the Spy.

00:12.303 --> 00:14.222
And my mom lives there.
She's freaking her out.

00:14.305 --> 00:16.683
-I mean, I get it. I'm hot.
-Che: Yeah, you are.

00:16.766 --> 00:18.852
I can barely keep my pants on.
I wanna jump over this table,

00:18.935 --> 00:21.062
and ride you like
a motherfuckin' Citi Bike.

00:21.146 --> 00:23.732
And by that,
I mean, after I come,

00:23.815 --> 00:26.109
-I wanna dump you
on 14th street.
-I'm telling you, dude.

00:26.192 --> 00:27.986
-She will not stop calling me.
-Carrie: Well,

00:28.069 --> 00:29.571
maybe she wants
her credit card back.

00:29.654 --> 00:32.240
-(Jackie laughing)
-Boom! C Bradshaw with a slam!

00:32.323 --> 00:34.617
Nah, she's not old enough
to qualify for credit yet.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.244
Recording:
Trigger warning!

00:36.327 --> 00:38.788
Che: Talking about sex with
a minor is never acceptable,

00:38.872 --> 00:42.208
-especially if the joke's
as lame as that one!
-(laughing)

00:42.292 --> 00:44.753
Uh, Che, listen,
I wanna, I wanna circle
back to something you

00:44.836 --> 00:48.173
-said earlier that
I'm personally triggered by.
-Sure, what?

00:48.256 --> 00:50.425
-Citi Bike.
-Me too, Carrie.

00:50.508 --> 00:52.927
-Oh, Miss Sis is on fire today.
-(laughing)

00:53.011 --> 00:53.803
I love it when you
bring your pussy in,
are you kidding?

00:53.887 --> 00:55.430
Thank you so much!
Soft pussy...

00:55.513 --> 00:59.350
(upbeat music playing)

01:04.147 --> 01:09.778
-Hey, nice job today.
-Oh, thanks. Yeah.

01:09.861 --> 01:11.404
I got a few zingers in.

01:11.488 --> 01:12.947
Oof, if you
weren't in mourning,

01:13.031 --> 01:14.616
I'd do 20 minutes
on you saying "zingers."

01:14.699 --> 01:16.451
Oh, well, phew.

01:16.534 --> 01:17.952
Thank god my husband died.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.413
How're you holdin' up?

01:20.497 --> 01:22.207
You know, it's been, uh,

01:22.290 --> 01:23.625
it's been a rough few weeks.

01:23.708 --> 01:25.919
-Yeah...
-But just keep reminding myself

01:26.002 --> 01:29.339
that at least
we were happy...
at the end.

01:29.422 --> 01:31.174
Never been happier.

01:31.257 --> 01:33.009
God, doesn't that
make it sadder?

01:33.092 --> 01:35.804
Oddly, no.
No, it, um...

01:36.429 --> 01:38.139
it helps.

01:38.223 --> 01:39.766
It's happy sad.

01:39.849 --> 01:41.184
Wow, that's an amazing
way of looking at it.

01:41.267 --> 01:44.562
Anyway, that's what
I'm clinging to, so...

01:46.064 --> 01:48.358
I'll see you at your
Netflix taping Friday.

01:48.441 --> 01:50.944
Oh no, dude, you don't
have to come to that.
It's--

01:51.027 --> 01:51.736
You came to my funeral,

01:51.820 --> 01:54.447
I'm coming to your comedy show.

01:55.698 --> 01:58.368
Besides, I could
use a few zingers.

01:58.451 --> 02:01.704
Oh!
(chuckles)

02:01.788 --> 02:04.332
I listened to
the podcast yesterday.

02:04.415 --> 02:07.168
-Really? I'm shocked.
-I never said never.

02:07.252 --> 02:09.462
-Mm.
-It's a nice blend
of polemics and farts.

02:09.546 --> 02:13.925
Oh, thanks.
Remind me to never ask
you to blurb my books.

02:16.010 --> 02:17.178
And Che is funny.

02:17.262 --> 02:20.515
Oh, good.
I'm glad you think so
because you're coming

02:20.598 --> 02:21.599
with me to their comedy
concert Friday night.

02:21.683 --> 02:23.726
-I am?!
-Carrie: Mm-hm.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.019
Oh, great!

02:26.938 --> 02:29.274
You seem a little
better today.

02:29.357 --> 02:32.694
Well, I feel like I'm in the,
I'm in the home stretch.

02:32.777 --> 02:36.197
The whole death trifecta.

02:36.281 --> 02:40.910
-What's that trifecta?
-Oh, uh, it's the awful night,

02:40.994 --> 02:44.414
funeral, and now,
the reading of the will.

02:44.497 --> 02:45.498
And then,
we get to have lunch.

02:45.582 --> 02:48.209
-I'm thinking I might
even eat today.
-Good!

02:48.293 --> 02:49.878
That's progress.

02:49.961 --> 02:51.963
-That's my story
and I'm stickin' to it.
-(Miranda laughs)

02:52.046 --> 02:54.382
Estate Lawyer:
He will continue his
annual legacy gifts

02:54.465 --> 02:56.175
to Memorial Sloan Kettering,

02:56.259 --> 02:57.051
New York
Public Theater,

02:57.135 --> 03:00.680
and Preservation Hall
in New Orleans.

03:00.763 --> 03:03.266
-He loved his jazz.
-(intercom beeps)

03:03.349 --> 03:05.143
Assistant (on intercom):
Norman, it's your wife again.

03:05.226 --> 03:08.021
I said hold all calls.
Thank you.

03:08.104 --> 03:09.647
-Where were we?
-Not taking your wife's calls.

03:09.731 --> 03:12.734
Sorry... we had a fight.

03:12.817 --> 03:14.152
(phone ringing)

03:14.235 --> 03:17.572
And now,
she's on my Apple Watch.
I better take this.

03:17.655 --> 03:19.032
I'm in the maison du chien.

03:19.115 --> 03:22.201
That's "dog house"
in pompous ass.

03:22.285 --> 03:23.161
Do you wanna keep talking
or do you wanna hear
my side of it?

03:23.244 --> 03:26.497
-God, Gloria...
-Yes, oh, I know, I know.

03:26.581 --> 03:29.083
You've got a lunch, honey,
I know. Okay, so...

03:30.835 --> 03:33.922
-Oh, hello there!
-Stanford! Hi!

03:34.005 --> 03:35.340
What are you doing here?

03:35.423 --> 03:38.635
Oh, I came for lunch.

03:38.718 --> 03:39.344
Carrie invited me.

03:39.427 --> 03:42.263
-Oh...
-Why? Is that a problem?

03:42.347 --> 03:44.349
No, no, of course not.

03:44.432 --> 03:46.935
It's just I reserved
a table for three.

03:47.018 --> 03:49.354
Oh, I don't think
that'll be an issue.

03:49.437 --> 03:51.356
Three-top is
always a four-top.

03:51.439 --> 03:53.483
-Mm, no, no, it isn't.
-Trust me.

03:53.566 --> 03:55.443
I know from when
I used to work at Odeon.

03:55.526 --> 03:57.195
A three-top is
always a four-top.

03:57.278 --> 04:00.531
There is no way you
ever waited tables.

04:00.615 --> 04:04.661
Oh, I was a host back
in the go-go cocaine '80s.

04:04.744 --> 04:06.663
How else do you think
I know Bret Easton Ellis?

04:06.746 --> 04:08.957
Okay, whatever.

04:09.040 --> 04:12.085
It's just it was very
hard to find a place

04:12.168 --> 04:16.255
that Carrie had not
been to with either
Big or Samantha,

04:16.339 --> 04:17.131
so I don't wanna be difficult.

04:19.550 --> 04:21.302
Hm...

04:21.386 --> 04:22.971
Okay, well, this has
been building for years,

04:23.054 --> 04:26.474
so I'm just
gonna say it...

04:26.557 --> 04:28.977
You think I'm not part
of the "inner circle."

04:29.060 --> 04:30.603
That, that, that's right.

04:30.687 --> 04:33.815
My therapist thinks it's
because you're threatened

04:33.898 --> 04:36.109
by my relationship
with Carrie.

04:36.192 --> 04:39.654
You've been talking
about me in therapy?

04:39.737 --> 04:41.322
You've come up.
Gimlet!

04:43.282 --> 04:45.660
Because all you have
to do is walk-- Yeah...

04:45.743 --> 04:46.828
-Jesus Christ.
-Gloria: Okay,

04:46.911 --> 04:48.371
we're up to the last gift.

04:50.206 --> 04:52.500
"I hereby make a bequest
in the amount

04:52.583 --> 04:53.960
of one million dollars to--"

04:54.836 --> 04:56.421
Uh, Miranda?

04:58.715 --> 04:59.257
Do you wanna help me here?

05:01.300 --> 05:04.178
Why?
What's the, uh--

05:04.262 --> 05:05.304
Here it is.
One million dollars to--

05:10.768 --> 05:12.645
What's all the drama?
What's the charity?

05:12.729 --> 05:15.440
(mysterious music plays)

05:22.905 --> 05:26.367
-Natasha?
-His ex-wife.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.745
-What is this?
-I knew nothing about it.

05:28.828 --> 05:30.371
In my experience,
when people have
unfinished business,

05:30.455 --> 05:32.415
they tend to throw
money at it.
Yes, I'm still here.

05:32.498 --> 05:35.251
Gloria:
Norman, get off
the damned phone.

05:39.297 --> 05:40.715
Carrie:
I was doing well.

05:40.798 --> 05:43.509
-Wasn't I doing well
before this?
-Yes, you were.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.428
-Remarkably well.
-I was very impressed.

05:45.511 --> 05:48.056
I mean, I was doing the podcast,
I was washing my hair--

05:48.139 --> 05:49.891
I mean, yes, I wasn't
eating or sleeping,

05:49.974 --> 05:51.642
but at least I felt
good about my marriage,

05:51.726 --> 05:54.353
and now, I'm just
one of the wives

05:54.437 --> 05:56.397
-he was taking care of.
-Ow!

05:56.481 --> 06:00.943
-Worst four-top ever.
-I had a much better table.

06:01.027 --> 06:03.738
-Let it go, Charlotte.
-All right, you know what, here,
I-I'll switch seats with you.

06:03.821 --> 06:05.114
I'm used to getting
slammed from behind.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.158
No, nobody is
switching seats.
Hi!

06:07.241 --> 06:09.452
Uh, could you be more careful?
You keep hitting his seat.

06:09.535 --> 06:12.080
-And can I get another Cabernet?
-And what is she doing

06:12.163 --> 06:13.456
-in his will?
-That's the million
dollar question.

06:15.833 --> 06:17.794
Yeah, a million dollars.
Hello?

06:17.877 --> 06:20.421
Everyone, calm down.

06:20.505 --> 06:24.258
After taxes,
it's really only 450,000.

06:24.342 --> 06:26.260
Which is a shit-ton
of money!

06:26.344 --> 06:28.429
On top of what I'm sure
was a very generous
divorce settlement, right?

06:28.513 --> 06:29.972
All right, you know what,
it's not even about the money.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.724
It really isn't.
I would be just as upset

06:31.808 --> 06:34.727
if I, if I found out
that he left her $10.
But just--

06:35.603 --> 06:37.271
Why is she in there at all?

06:37.355 --> 06:38.189
Well, he did
destroy her life.

06:38.272 --> 06:40.775
Charlotte:
He did not destroy her life.

06:40.858 --> 06:43.569
-I saw her at Bergdorf
pre-pandemic.
-How did she look?

06:43.653 --> 06:46.447
Like someone whose life
was not destroyed.

06:46.531 --> 06:49.951
Well, fuck her perfect,
not-destroyed life,

06:50.034 --> 06:51.702
and her pre-tax
million dollars.

06:51.786 --> 06:53.037
Carrie:
Okay, first of all, no.

06:53.121 --> 06:54.956
We're not doing that.
She didn't do anything wrong.

06:55.039 --> 06:57.208
I'm the one who
had the affair...

06:57.291 --> 07:00.628
-with her husband.
-He was with you first,

07:00.711 --> 07:02.797
so really,
she cheated on you

07:02.880 --> 07:04.006
before you cheated on her.

07:04.090 --> 07:07.927
-God, you're a good friend.
-Seriously, where is my wine?

07:08.010 --> 07:09.053
And why did he
keep it a secret?

07:09.137 --> 07:12.515
He didn't even tell Gloria,
and she knew his blood type.

07:12.598 --> 07:13.599
Do not let this eat you up!

07:13.683 --> 07:17.270
You and Big
were the happiest
couple I know.

07:17.353 --> 07:19.438
Sorry, no offense.

07:19.522 --> 07:20.565
-None taken.
-It's okay.

07:20.648 --> 07:21.649
Oh yeah,
well, thanks.

07:21.732 --> 07:22.775
I thought we
were good, too,

07:22.859 --> 07:24.110
but then, why was
he still thinking

07:24.193 --> 07:26.487
about her after all this time?

07:26.571 --> 07:29.157
And what was their
unfinished business?

07:30.533 --> 07:31.784
I just can't believe it.

07:34.245 --> 07:37.999
Big's gone and Natasha's back.

07:38.082 --> 07:39.542
Did you even know
they were in touch?

07:41.043 --> 07:43.171
-Who said they were in touch?
-Or not...

07:43.254 --> 07:46.424
-Ow!
-You deserved that one.

Why?
Do you have a time machine?

16:10.094 --> 16:11.512
I did not. Why?

It's the prelude to why
I went crazy today.

16:13.597 --> 16:15.891

16:15.974 --> 16:17.851
Well, I was going
through his stuff,

16:17.935 --> 16:21.897
and the single photo
I found in his wallet

16:21.980 --> 16:24.775
is of a dog he
never even mentioned.

16:24.858 --> 16:27.695
Oh! And a Pinkberry punch card.

16:27.778 --> 16:31.865

about him and Natasha,

16:42.626 --> 16:44.878

16:44.962 --> 16:47.881
-to rid myself
of this feeling--
-What feeling?

16:47.965 --> 16:49.925
That there was something
that I didn't know.

16:50.008 --> 16:51.844
-So I decided...
-Mm-hm.

16:51.927 --> 16:55.848
that the best way for me
to just move past this

16:55.931 --> 16:59.727
is to look Natasha
in the eye, and just...

16:59.810 --> 17:02.479
have a grown-up conversation.

17:02.563 --> 17:06.525
-So, I emailed her.
-Y-- Wait, y-you, you did?

17:06.608 --> 17:08.569
Yep, I sure did,
and it wasn't easy.

17:08.652 --> 17:10.404
The first email that
I sent bounced back

17:10.487 --> 17:12.573
because, apparently, she
took some highfalutin job

17:12.656 --> 17:14.742
at Mina Minetti, which is,

17:14.825 --> 17:18.287

your brain around this,

I'll tell you exactly.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.642
At approximately--

17:40.726 --> 17:44.605
Yep. 1:40 today and nothing.

17:44.688 --> 17:47.733
Nothing. Not a word.

17:47.816 --> 17:49.693
doesn't respond

17:49.777 --> 17:52.279
Miranda: A busy one.
It's only been a few hours.

17:52.362 --> 17:54.990
-Carrie, did you get any
sleep at all last night?
- No, of course not.

the apartment, too...

-Pinkberry.

she didn't get my email.

18:19.640 --> 18:22.518
I say we give her another day.
I think it's, it's fine that you

18:22.601 --> 18:24.645
-emailed her. I think--
-Too late, I just did it.

18:25.604 --> 18:28.565
Oh shit...
Now I'm scared.

18:28.649 --> 18:32.861
Don't be scared.
You, you just lost your husband.

18:32.945 --> 18:36.156

She's gonna respond
with compassion.

18:36.240 --> 18:39.284
You're right.
What am I afraid of?

The worst that can
happen already happened.

18:46.583 --> 18:50.462

blocked me on Instagram!

hiding in an SUV
with tinted windows.

19:01.765 --> 19:02.850

no choice.

19:02.933 --> 19:06.019
She blocked me on Instagram,
I can't reach her through email.

19:06.103 --> 19:09.064
I need to somehow
have this conversation...

19:11.108 --> 19:13.318
so I can put an end
to the spiraling.

19:13.402 --> 19:15.445

to the spiraling.

they were in touch.

19:42.973 --> 19:44.057

19:45.517 --> 19:47.311
Oh my god, I don't know
where to begin.

19:48.312 --> 19:51.607
That he regretted
choosing me over her?

19:51.690 --> 19:53.066
He didn't.

19:53.150 --> 19:54.067
That she had
an affair with him

19:54.151 --> 19:56.904
to get back at me
for what I did.

19:56.987 --> 19:58.739
-She didn't!
-Charlotte, you can't
tell me that.

19:58.822 --> 20:00.866

-Years!

of us even thinks about it.

23:59.896 --> 24:02.524
(all yelling, swearing)

24:04.651 --> 24:06.528
♪ ♪

24:09.281 --> 24:10.657
Carrie:
Oh shit.

24:10.740 --> 24:12.576
-Charlotte: Sorry, sorry.
-Miranda: Ow! My knees!

24:12.659 --> 24:15.620
Oh, this is why
I gave up running.

24:15.704 --> 24:17.330
I was pointing at her.

24:17.414 --> 24:20.041
(laughs)
This is so bad,
it's almost funny.

24:20.125 --> 24:22.210
No, not funny.

24:22.294 --> 24:24.921
I have never been
so humiliated,

24:25.005 --> 24:27.841
and I've been humiliated
a lot in front of that woman.

24:27.924 --> 24:31.469
She is the one who should
be humiliated, not you!

24:31.553 --> 24:33.138
You caught her in a lie.

24:34.264 --> 24:35.348
And she caught me in the truth.

24:37.601 --> 24:39.352
Oh... Oh...

24:39.436 --> 24:41.855
-Carrie...
-Charlotte: Aw!

24:41.938 --> 24:43.481
(phone ringing)

24:48.111 --> 24:50.322
Hi. What're you
doing up so early?

24:50.405 --> 24:52.657
Carrie:
Oh, I'm in Central Park,
walking.

24:52.741 --> 24:54.868
It's amazing what you
learn about our city
when you don't sleep.

24:54.951 --> 24:57.370
For instance,
were you aware that
thousands of people jog

24:57.454 --> 25:00.957
every morning at 6 AM,
and everyone has a dog.

25:01.041 --> 25:03.543
I did know that.

25:04.502 --> 25:06.796
So, you didn't sleep again?

25:06.880 --> 25:08.548
Carrie: (laughs)
That's hilarious, sleep.

25:08.632 --> 25:13.511
Every time I closed my eyes,
I saw Natasha up on her throne,

25:13.595 --> 25:14.095
looking down at me.

25:14.179 --> 25:17.057
-(urinating)
-Harry!

25:17.140 --> 25:18.892
I'm on the phone here!

25:18.975 --> 25:21.269
This is the bathroom!
I think I have the right of way.

25:21.353 --> 25:23.897
No, no, I can let you go.
I just wanted to tell
you about tonight.

25:23.980 --> 25:25.815
Um, Miranda's gonna
meet us at Che's taping,

25:25.899 --> 25:28.235
-so I'll pick you up at 8, okay?
-Charlotte: Got it.

25:28.318 --> 25:30.570
-Where ya headed now?
-Carrie: Oh, who knows?

25:30.654 --> 25:33.240
Think I'll follow this
basset hound here...

25:33.323 --> 25:34.783
see where she takes me, hm!

25:34.866 --> 25:36.576
Charlotte:
Okay, bye. I love you.

25:36.660 --> 25:37.619
(urinating)

25:39.537 --> 25:42.249
Still? You're still peeing?

25:42.332 --> 25:44.000
A lotta men my age can't
pull off a stream like this.

25:44.084 --> 25:46.378
Count your blessings.

25:46.461 --> 25:49.923
(urinating continues)

25:51.591 --> 25:53.885
-Oh! Here I am!
-Hey!

25:54.803 --> 25:56.471
I see you.

25:56.554 --> 25:59.432
You're the only 55-year-old
sitting on the university steps.

25:59.516 --> 26:03.103
-And now, there are two of us.
-(laughing)

26:03.186 --> 26:05.647
You know, when I got
your text on the subway,

26:05.730 --> 26:07.649
-I thought your phone
had been hacked.
-Hm.

26:07.732 --> 26:10.735
You really walked
all this way?
In those shoes?!

26:11.611 --> 26:12.737
These are my sneakers.

26:13.863 --> 26:15.031
How much time do you have?

26:15.115 --> 26:16.616
Uh, for you,
all the time in the world,

26:16.700 --> 26:19.786
but I have class
in 12 minutes,
so start talking.

26:19.869 --> 26:22.706
Okay, well,
I guess the headline is,
"I can't stop walking."

26:22.789 --> 26:27.669
It's the only
thing that helps,
and it's not helping.

26:27.752 --> 26:30.005
I guess all that
moving around is better
than sitting still,

26:30.088 --> 26:34.050
and feeling...
whatever it is you're
not wanting to feel.

26:34.134 --> 26:36.845
-And what would that be?
-You tell me.

26:38.638 --> 26:38.680
(sighs)

26:42.058 --> 26:44.185
I'm really mad at Big.

26:46.062 --> 26:49.149
I almost forgot
how I used to feel
all those years ago.

26:49.232 --> 26:51.526
You know, so nervous,
and insecure, and desperate.

26:54.571 --> 26:57.407
You know, like what
we had wasn't enough.

26:57.490 --> 26:59.075
Like I wasn't enough.

27:01.745 --> 27:04.331
And I just hate that
after all the good years,

27:04.414 --> 27:05.957
this is what
I'm left with.

27:09.336 --> 27:12.380
He ruined our happy sad ending.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.679
-Thank you.
-For what?

27:19.763 --> 27:23.391
For not arguing with me,
trying to make me feel better.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.393
Me? Argue?

27:25.477 --> 27:28.438
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

27:31.566 --> 27:33.902
Charlotte:
Go, go. Go.

27:33.985 --> 27:35.737
Go, go, go. Go.

27:35.820 --> 27:38.698
Hey!
I just stopped by your place.
Where are you?

27:38.782 --> 27:42.535
Oh, still walking.
I'm now in a very exotic place

27:42.619 --> 27:45.497
called the Upper West Side.

27:45.580 --> 27:48.375
82nd and Amsterdam,
but unlike the other Amsterdam,

27:48.458 --> 27:49.542
no tulips or wooden shoes.

27:49.626 --> 27:53.046
Still walking?
I am worried about you.

27:53.129 --> 27:55.048
Well, you should be.
I'm a mess.

27:55.131 --> 27:57.384
-You're not a mess, Carrie.
You're just--
-Charlotte, Charlotte.

27:57.467 --> 28:01.137
You have to let
me say I'm a mess.

28:01.221 --> 28:04.224
-Okay.
-I mean,
I appreciate it, I do,

28:04.307 --> 28:05.725
but nobody can
make me feel better.

28:06.476 --> 28:08.686
I have to get there myself,

28:08.770 --> 28:10.271
which is gonna take a hell
of a lot more walking,

28:10.355 --> 28:12.607
but first, I have to pee.

28:12.690 --> 28:14.192
So, I'm gonna go
in this little shop here,

28:14.275 --> 28:16.027
and I'm gonna buy a coffee,

28:16.111 --> 28:18.363
so I can use
their bathroom,
and not feel bad.

28:18.446 --> 28:20.281
Oh, and then,
I'm gonna have to pee again

28:20.365 --> 28:22.534
-in Chelsea.
-Got it.

28:22.617 --> 28:26.162
-It's a vicious cycle.
-I understand. I love you.

28:26.246 --> 28:30.458
Mr. Burton, come!
Come, come, come, come!

28:34.963 --> 28:36.881
-Someone's in here!
-Oh my god! Sor--

28:36.965 --> 28:38.967
-Ah!
-Oh my god!

28:39.050 --> 28:41.136
(screams)

28:41.219 --> 28:43.471
Ouch!
(gasps)

28:55.191 --> 28:57.777
At a coffee shop?
At my job?

28:57.861 --> 28:59.737
Where are you gonna hunt
me down next, Carrie?

28:59.821 --> 29:01.281
In the showers at Equinox?

29:01.364 --> 29:03.950
I swear, this was
a total coincidence.

29:04.033 --> 29:07.203
I never imagined
in a million years
you'd be all the way up here.

29:07.287 --> 29:08.663
This isn't even
your neighborhood.

29:11.541 --> 29:13.460
Yes, I also know
where you live.

29:13.543 --> 29:15.462
What do you
want from me?

29:15.545 --> 29:17.422
What the fuck do
you want from me?!

29:19.257 --> 29:20.717
Carrie:
Um...

29:22.802 --> 29:23.845
I'm not really sure anymore.

29:26.055 --> 29:27.140
But since
you're here,

29:27.223 --> 29:30.351
do you think maybe we could
just talk, just for a minute?

29:30.435 --> 29:31.311
I don't have a minute.

29:31.394 --> 29:33.813
No, I am not doing this.

29:33.897 --> 29:35.815
I cannot think
about you anymore!

29:35.899 --> 29:37.775
I am done
thinking about you!

29:37.859 --> 29:40.904
I've already given you
more minutes of my life
than you ever deserved!

29:42.071 --> 29:42.739
Yes, you have. I agree.

29:51.331 --> 29:52.582
That...

29:53.500 --> 29:54.834
The burn looks bad.

29:54.918 --> 29:56.294
Carrie:
No, it's fine.

29:56.377 --> 29:58.838
It doesn't look fine.
You should ice it.

29:58.922 --> 30:00.256
I'm fine, I'm fine.

30:00.882 --> 30:01.841
(sighs)

30:09.891 --> 30:11.559
My son has...

30:11.643 --> 30:14.062
low blood sugar,
so I have to make sure I...

30:14.145 --> 30:16.189
carry something around
with me at all times.

30:18.024 --> 30:19.609
-You have a son?
-Mm.

30:20.276 --> 30:23.363
Two, actually.

30:23.446 --> 30:25.532
Just dropped
them at Trinity,
right up here.

30:27.033 --> 30:29.160
But you already
know that, don't you?

30:29.244 --> 30:31.371
Actually, I didn't.

30:36.793 --> 30:37.794
Thank you.

30:44.008 --> 30:45.051
(sighs)

30:45.134 --> 30:46.970
If this is about the will...

30:47.053 --> 30:50.265
I've already told
my lawyers I will
not accept it.

30:50.348 --> 30:50.765
Give it to charity.

30:52.725 --> 30:55.562
Why did he leave
it to me anyway?

30:55.645 --> 30:57.605
I haven't spoken
to him since the divorce.

30:59.566 --> 31:00.984
So, neither of us knows?

31:02.151 --> 31:03.778
'Cause I just found out
at the will reading.

31:06.406 --> 31:07.907
Oh...

31:07.991 --> 31:10.660
Well, that must've been...
hard.

31:12.829 --> 31:14.622
(sighs)

31:14.706 --> 31:17.625
Classic John.
Just always a puzzle.

31:18.209 --> 31:19.419
At least with me.

31:21.421 --> 31:23.464
I'll never understand
why he ever married me

31:23.548 --> 31:25.425
when he was always
in love with you.

31:30.013 --> 31:31.389
How's the burn?

31:31.472 --> 31:34.225
It's... It's better.

31:34.309 --> 31:36.811
Well, I am late,
so I should go.

31:43.359 --> 31:45.486
I really am sorry
for your loss.

31:46.154 --> 31:46.904
Thank you for that...

31:48.406 --> 31:49.490
and for the ice.

31:51.284 --> 31:53.369
And for whatever it's worth,

31:54.787 --> 31:56.456
I think the money was his way

31:56.539 --> 32:00.043
of saying that he was sorry.

32:02.003 --> 32:03.713
You know,
he was a finance guy.

32:04.380 --> 32:05.423
He's not--

32:06.049 --> 32:08.301
wasn't great with words.

32:10.053 --> 32:10.845
Agreed.

32:13.931 --> 32:15.683
And I'm sorry as well.

32:18.394 --> 32:21.022
Oh god, for everything.

32:25.276 --> 32:26.527
I appreciate that...

32:28.905 --> 32:31.741
but we're okay.
It's all in the past.

32:33.660 --> 32:36.287
But, maybe, we shouldn't

32:36.371 --> 32:38.122
follow each other on Instagram.

32:38.998 --> 32:41.501
100%. Totally agree.

32:53.638 --> 32:54.514
(sighs)

32:54.597 --> 32:57.350
(light music playing)

33:10.613 --> 33:14.575
(cheers and applause)

33:14.659 --> 33:16.994
Che:
Ohh, yeah, so...

33:17.078 --> 33:18.830
I've dated a lot in my life.

33:18.913 --> 33:21.541
-I've dated men--
-(audience boos)

33:21.624 --> 33:26.170
-I've dated women--
-(audience cheers)

33:26.254 --> 33:27.171
I've dated...

33:27.255 --> 33:29.173
men who actually know
how to please a woman.

33:29.257 --> 33:30.466
-He was nice.
-Woo!

33:30.550 --> 33:33.720
Umm, I've dated...

33:33.803 --> 33:36.222
pretty much everyone in here.
Cheer if I fucked you.

33:36.305 --> 33:39.475
(audience cheers)

33:39.559 --> 33:41.853
-Cheer if you fucked me.
-(audience cheers)

33:41.936 --> 33:44.981
Oh... cheer if you
want me to fuck you.

33:45.064 --> 33:46.691
(audience cheers)

33:46.774 --> 33:48.234
(Che laughs)

33:48.317 --> 33:49.110
When you said
VIP seats,

33:49.193 --> 33:52.530
I assumed there'd
actually be seats.

33:52.613 --> 33:54.782
You know, a lot of people
have no idea how to process

33:54.866 --> 33:57.618
gender individuality,
and that is because

33:57.702 --> 34:00.329
every time we are represented
in mainstream media,

34:00.413 --> 34:03.624
we have to be from some
other galaxy... right?

34:03.708 --> 34:05.752
Or like some super
skinny model.

34:05.835 --> 34:06.919
Or like, uh,
an ethereal magical elf

34:07.003 --> 34:10.298
with an ethereal magical
elf septum nose ring.

34:10.381 --> 34:11.591
(audience laughing)

34:11.674 --> 34:13.050
Oh, and check it out!

34:13.134 --> 34:14.802
When we are earthbound,

34:14.886 --> 34:17.430
we are always
at a murder scene...

34:17.513 --> 34:18.806
never at a birthday party.

34:19.891 --> 34:21.267
Oh, and...

34:21.350 --> 34:23.394
there's always only one of us.

34:23.478 --> 34:25.271
Never with a friend.

34:25.354 --> 34:27.690
Just one sad
nonbinary character,

34:27.774 --> 34:29.650
or just one sad...

34:29.734 --> 34:32.069
trans character just wandering.

34:32.153 --> 34:34.614
"I'm so sad and alone."

34:34.697 --> 34:36.491
"I'm so sad--"
Look...

34:36.574 --> 34:38.409
It's okay to be sad
and alone, all right?

34:38.493 --> 34:39.786
There's plenty to be sad about,

34:39.869 --> 34:41.913
but I have got news
for those motherfuckers,

34:41.996 --> 34:42.497
I'm not always sad!

34:42.580 --> 34:45.291
(audience cheers)

34:45.374 --> 34:47.376
I laugh.
I laugh all the fuckin' time.

34:47.460 --> 34:50.713
(Che laughs)

34:50.797 --> 34:53.007
And I'm not always alone.

34:53.090 --> 34:54.675
I have community,
I have allies,

34:54.759 --> 34:58.763
-I have friends--
-(audience cheers)

34:58.846 --> 35:03.184
Listen, put our real asses
on TV, okay? All right?

35:03.267 --> 35:04.977
We are gonna smell like
pot when we get home.

35:05.061 --> 35:07.814
How am I gonna
explain this to my kids?

35:07.897 --> 35:09.732
How am I gonna explain
this to my doorman?

35:09.816 --> 35:12.193
-You're missing it!
-Che: I think the world
can handle it.

35:12.276 --> 35:14.278
And I know this because
my own family handled it.

35:14.362 --> 35:17.240
Half-Mexican, half-Irish,
all Catholic.

35:17.323 --> 35:19.992
That is... That is
a lotta rice and beads.

35:23.955 --> 35:26.582
The Thanksgiving
I came out to my family,

35:26.666 --> 35:28.584
I stood up in the living room,
and I was like...

35:30.419 --> 35:31.462
"Family...

35:31.921 --> 35:33.464
"I love you!

35:34.966 --> 35:37.885
"And I just want you to know...

35:40.137 --> 35:41.430
"that I am queer...

35:42.014 --> 35:43.516
"and nonbinary...
