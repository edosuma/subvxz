00:31.542 --> 00:33.169
Don't call me.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.173
Fuck, school!

00:44.958 --> 00:46.380
Is there breakfast?

00:48.417 --> 00:50.511
Control freak calling.

00:51.375 --> 00:53.127
What does she want now?

00:53.958 --> 00:55.676
<i>Hi,</i> Lisi.
<i>- Hi...</i>

00:58.625 --> 01:01.549
Are you going to call every morning
to see if I'm awake?

01:01.750 --> 01:04.378
Elisabeth, you left him.

01:04.667 --> 01:07.671
If you kick him out,
who'll look after me?

01:08.833 --> 01:12.417
I want to graduate in Germany,
not in England. We had a deal.

01:13.583 --> 01:15.927
Hey, pass the coffee, Martina.

01:17.083 --> 01:19.836
It's Meike.
We were on a class trip together.

01:20.208 --> 01:21.630
Oh, right

01:24.250 --> 01:28.130
I have to go. Today's your field trip
to the Job Information Center.

01:28.458 --> 01:31.837
Meeting point in 30 minutes
at the subway. It's in your calendar.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.001
I have a calendar?

01:34.000 --> 01:35.547
Take out the waste paper!

01:35.875 --> 01:37.548
Yeah, right.

02:04.708 --> 02:08.211
Dude, buy yourself some deodorant.
- Yeah, he reeks.

02:08.667 --> 02:11.044
It's because I get upset all day long!

02:11.208 --> 02:14.417
He's in puberty!
- I already use three deodorants.

02:14.583 --> 02:17.632
It's just hormones.
It gets better when you reach adulthood.

02:17.792 --> 02:19.385
Tickets, please.

02:21.250 --> 02:23.423
Where are your monthly passes?
- I sold mine.

02:23.750 --> 02:25.127
Lost
- Never had one.

02:25.458 --> 02:27.335
Your tickets, please.

02:28.917 --> 02:30.339
Never mind.

02:34.875 --> 02:37.094
Nice one, bro!

02:38.792 --> 02:40.009
Dear youths,

02:40.333 --> 02:43.758
these are the computers
of the Job Information Center, or JIC.

02:44.083 --> 02:47.963
Answer the questionnaire, and the
computer... Click, clack, ping!

02:48.292 --> 02:50.294
Will suggest
a great job for you.

02:50.625 --> 02:54.050
We're not from the Smurf village,
you can speak normally.

02:55.458 --> 02:57.176
I ENJOY WORKING WITH CHILDREN...

02:57.500 --> 02:59.548
MY DESK IS ALWAYS CLEAN...

03:00.458 --> 03:02.711
I ENJOY WORKING WITH CHILDREN...

03:03.042 --> 03:04.965
ONLY IF NECESSARY.

03:07.167 --> 03:08.669
I LIKE ANIMALS.

03:09.917 --> 03:11.339
CAREER SUGGESTION:
BUTCHER

03:11.667 --> 03:14.546
Are these computers broken?
- No. Kids are often surprised

03:14.708 --> 03:16.210
after proper analysis.

03:16.542 --> 03:18.965
"Mechan..." "Mechantronic engineer"?

03:19.292 --> 03:22.421
"Wastewater specialist".
- Lovely.

03:22.750 --> 03:25.469
"Geriatric nurse"?
- Any questions?

03:26.750 --> 03:29.469
No, I don't want that.
The computer's retarded.

03:29.792 --> 03:31.590
"Police officer"!
- No, a cop?

03:32.375 --> 03:33.922
Well, that's not...
- Lame!

03:34.250 --> 03:36.002
It's all lame!

03:36.167 --> 03:38.465
You call this motivational?
Can you reprogram it?

03:38.792 --> 03:41.545
Experts developed
highly complex algorithms for this.

03:41.708 --> 03:44.427
Experts for suicide or what?
I get "butcher."

03:44.750 --> 03:48.254
Maybe you should've taken the test
before becoming a teacher.

03:48.417 --> 03:51.136
<i>I love my job.
I activate the elderly,</i>

03:51.458 --> 03:54.632
<i>I help the elderly,
and I care for the elderly.</i>

03:55.250 --> 03:57.423
<i>That means joint activities...</i>

03:57.750 --> 03:59.502
OMG, that wart!

04:00.458 --> 04:03.541
She probably got it
from kissing an old man!

04:04.500 --> 04:07.674
<i>We'll all be old someday.
And you get so much in return.</i>

04:08.000 --> 04:10.970
<i>Like money, or jewelry
when someone dies, for example.</i>

04:12.125 --> 04:15.709
<i>I advise customers
on our latest entertainment products.</i>

04:15.917 --> 04:17.418
<i>I have to keep up to date,</i>

04:17.750 --> 04:20.003
<i>save the princess
or fight monsters in kill mode.</i>

04:20.166 --> 04:22.761
<i>A lot of people say
video games make you nervous.</i>

04:23.083 --> 04:24.881
<i>But I disagree.</i>

04:25.625 --> 04:27.252
Who got that job?

04:27.583 --> 04:29.210
<i>Be an entertainment specialist...</i>
- I <i>did.</i>

04:29.542 --> 04:32.091
Why does he get the cool job
and I get sewage plant?

04:32.250 --> 04:35.174
What did you answer?
It's not fair!

04:35.500 --> 04:38.925
Quiet! I've rarely seen
such an unmotivated class.

04:39.250 --> 04:41.924
<i>Chill.
- People think</i> a <i>sewage plant is boring.</i>

04:42.250 --> 04:44.252
<i>This is you, bro.
- But it's</i> a <i>real adventure.</i>

04:44.583 --> 04:47.177
<i>The operation of complex machinery</i>

04:47.500 --> 04:50.470
<i>is only part of this challenging job.</i>

04:50.792 --> 04:54.592
That machine only has one button!
I have to press one button all day long?

04:54.750 --> 04:57.833
One button can hold
a lot of responsibility.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.129
Not that you're overchallenged, Danger.
- Fuck you, girl!

05:02.542 --> 05:04.089
That is so destructive!

05:04.417 --> 05:06.761
Sorry, but based on their grades

05:06.917 --> 05:09.545
and our test results,
these jobs are a good match.

05:09.708 --> 05:12.052
I don't want to change oil!
- Turn it off!

05:12.708 --> 05:14.710
You're scaring me.
What kind of students are they?

05:15.042 --> 05:16.715
They're a bit, well...

05:17.042 --> 05:19.295
Aggressive?
- Sensitive.

05:27.583 --> 05:29.711
We don't want to watch this anymore.

05:30.208 --> 05:32.677
Your behavior is impossible!

05:33.000 --> 05:37.255
Your school will be informed.
Someone will pay for this damage.

05:37.583 --> 05:42.464
I doubt that any of you will ever become
a full-fledged member of society.

05:44.875 --> 05:47.128
That counts for you, especially.

05:58.500 --> 06:00.093
How was school?

06:05.875 --> 06:08.344
You're not asleep, the beer's still cold.

06:08.500 --> 06:10.969
Don't you have to prepare for class?

06:12.667 --> 06:15.511
You realize this is silly, right?

06:17.292 --> 06:20.671
Danger's phone has been off all day.
Did something happen?

06:24.792 --> 06:28.126
This is Danger. I'm not here.
- Danger, it's me again.

06:29.083 --> 06:32.337
This is my fifth message.
What's going on?

06:36.833 --> 06:38.961
Hey, bitches.
- Hey, hustlers.

06:41.792 --> 06:42.714
Thanks.

06:43.833 --> 06:46.461
How long do I work today?

06:47.125 --> 06:49.969
Till 6th period
- Dude, that long?

06:50.125 --> 06:53.129
And the school inspector's coming today.
- Oh, god.

07:06.708 --> 07:09.257
It's a comprehensive school,
any dummy can do it.

07:09.917 --> 07:11.840
Hey!
You're ruining my rep.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.879
What now?
- It's Leimbach-Knorr and the terrier.

07:15.042 --> 07:18.672
We'll see if they're on time today.
- I doubt it.

07:18.833 --> 07:21.461
If they tell Gerster, it's trouble.

07:23.083 --> 07:24.130
Hey!

07:24.875 --> 07:28.209
Guys!
- How will you get to school in 5 minutes?

07:28.375 --> 07:31.345
Squeeze in! -We're not supposed to
ride with old people,

07:31.500 --> 07:33.753
there's a bulletin about that.

07:33.917 --> 07:38.002
The school inspector's coming today.
- Oh, how important.

07:38.333 --> 07:41.667
You think I'll sit in class
while you burst condoms hang out here?

07:41.833 --> 07:44.552
If our future jobs are in sewage plants
and old-age homes,

07:44.875 --> 07:47.173
why keep going to fucking school?

07:47.500 --> 07:48.592
Get in the car!

08:12.042 --> 08:13.043
I know!

08:19.250 --> 08:20.547
Out of the way!

08:31.292 --> 08:32.635
Gonzo!

08:35.292 --> 08:36.794
There you are!

08:38.875 --> 08:41.048
All right, now I got you.

08:41.832 --> 08:43.255
Come along, Gonzo.

08:43.582 --> 08:45.631
How did you find him
using your phone?

08:45.958 --> 08:49.132
I had him chipped. ls yours gone too?
- I have many, unfortunately.

08:49.458 --> 08:52.428
Chip them or castrate them.
Anything else is a waste of time.

08:52.583 --> 08:54.256
Come along, Gonzo!

08:57.167 --> 09:00.091
That's nitpicking, Eckhart, isn't it?
But fine...

09:16.417 --> 09:19.717
Such a great colleague.
We're finished, then?

09:20.042 --> 09:22.340
We still need to see
the sanitary facilities.

09:22.500 --> 09:25.003
Are you coming?
- Yes.

09:25.333 --> 09:27.677
Graffiti was supposed to be removed.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.718
Why this pressure?

09:30.042 --> 09:33.125
You never used to take
these inspections so seriously.

09:33.292 --> 09:37.251
Which way to the restrooms?
I don't see any signs anywhere.

09:52.750 --> 09:56.380
The toilets don't work in the ladies'
room, so this is unisex lavatory

09:56.542 --> 09:59.170
until we get the funding to renovate.
-ls someone smoking in here?

10:01.083 --> 10:02.676
Open up at once!

10:14.958 --> 10:16.960
Don't you have class?

10:17.583 --> 10:20.712
"Mr. Miller. Science club..."

10:21.042 --> 10:22.840
What are you working on?

10:25.792 --> 10:27.419
Drones.

10:29.042 --> 10:30.385
Problem.

10:30.542 --> 10:34.592
I'm going to measure contaminant levels
in the chemistry rooms, then we'll talk.

10:37.083 --> 10:39.461
How embarrassing!
In front of the school inspector.

10:39.792 --> 10:43.092
One more time
and you're on cleaning duty!

10:44.125 --> 10:46.799
When does your class start?
- Around 11, I guess.

10:46.958 --> 10:50.041
Oh. When the big hand
points to "around", or what?

10:51.000 --> 10:55.005
Seems you've already given notice mentally?
- Not just mentally.

10:55.333 --> 10:58.633
Once the little twerps graduate,
I'm out of here.

11:03.125 --> 11:04.968
Oh, no!
- See you later, Honey.

11:05.292 --> 11:09.172
Puke one more time, you'll feel better.
- I'm a pro. Great party, wasn't it?

11:09.500 --> 11:11.878
So awesome!
- You have your lunchbox?

11:12.208 --> 11:13.505
Did you do your homework?

11:13.833 --> 11:15.176
Ms. Enzberger!

11:15.333 --> 11:17.882
Good morning, Sabine.
- I finished the letter.

11:18.042 --> 11:20.170
OK. Love letter, check, check.
Read it to me.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.468
"Dear Marvin, when..."

11:22.792 --> 11:24.294
Bye.

11:24.458 --> 11:25.801
Yup.

11:25.958 --> 11:29.087
"Dear Marvin, when I see you,
I feel like I'm starvin'..."

11:31.250 --> 11:33.844
ls the letter for Marvin, Sabine?

11:34.000 --> 11:34.922
Yes.

11:35.250 --> 11:37.719
"For a long time I've considered..."

11:40.167 --> 11:42.169
Eckhart, you can't smoke in here.

11:42.375 --> 11:44.878
No. Please use the broken jug.

11:45.417 --> 11:48.717
I assume you're here
to talk about the Bunsen burners.

11:48.875 --> 11:51.469
I need 30.
I'd take 20, but no less.

11:52.167 --> 11:55.751
Bunsen burners
are the least of your worries, Gudrun.

11:56.083 --> 11:58.336
Your school could be closed.
There's an official complaint.

11:58.667 --> 12:01.671
From Erika?
- She's really pushing her school.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.550
You share the catchment area,
and she has submitted several complaints

12:05.708 --> 12:08.336
that your school has standards so low

12:08.667 --> 12:11.341
that your kids graduate
without any effort.

12:11.667 --> 12:13.920
Is this because
I wouldn't do dinner with you?

12:14.083 --> 12:15.926
Fine, Italian.
- Gudrun?

12:16.250 --> 12:19.925
My boss thinks you give problem kids
a free ride instead of helping them.

12:20.250 --> 12:22.594
Even late bloomers
deserve a chance at A-levels.

12:22.917 --> 12:25.545
Nowadays you can't
push everyone through. Gudrun!

12:26.667 --> 12:29.591
The '80s are over.
Some don't belong in upper secondary.

12:29.917 --> 12:34.252
They can't all be poets and thinkers.
Somebody has to set the letters,

12:34.583 --> 12:36.756
and turn on the printing machine.

12:37.958 --> 12:39.881
But Erika doesn't mention the refugees.

12:40.208 --> 12:43.337
I have illiterate Syrian kids!
They don't get sent to Erika's school.

12:43.667 --> 12:45.795
I get the headscarves,
she gets a school garden.

12:46.125 --> 12:47.923
Gudrun, please. Gudrun!

12:48.750 --> 12:52.004
Why did you apply for even more funds?

12:52.333 --> 12:55.883
You should've focused
on meeting the requirements instead.

12:56.958 --> 12:59.006
What would a school closure mean for me?

12:59.625 --> 13:02.219
There's a position in Bremen,
and one in Brandenburg.

13:02.375 --> 13:03.752
Brandenburg?

13:03.917 --> 13:06.386
Next I'll get a right-wing voter district,
or what?

13:06.542 --> 13:09.216
Don't get political,
you know this is on record.

13:09.542 --> 13:11.840
I need to report something positive.
- There.

13:12.167 --> 13:14.841
Our new Goethe statue. Bronze.
Culture media funding.

13:18.458 --> 13:20.927
I didn't know Goethe smoked?
- It's Che Guevara's head.

13:21.250 --> 13:24.629
We saved 2,000 euros. The Cuban Embassy
canceled their statue order.

13:27.083 --> 13:29.177
Well, you're the first to notice.

13:29.333 --> 13:32.007
Shouldn't kids know
what Goethe looks like?

13:32.167 --> 13:36.001
They only look as far as his knee.
People think it's a pen in his mouth.

13:37.708 --> 13:39.426
Didn't Mr. Miller mention a drone?

13:39.750 --> 13:41.172
Yes, I think so. Why?

13:41.500 --> 13:43.878
It's flying past your window.

13:44.208 --> 13:45.380
Help!

13:45.542 --> 13:48.011
<i>Mr. Miller, get your drone under control!</i>

13:55.708 --> 13:59.918
Hey, Justin Potter, how is it up there?
- Hasko, cut the crap!

14:04.583 --> 14:06.210
Mr. Miller, help!

14:07.958 --> 14:09.426
I'm coming!

14:11.792 --> 14:13.089
Is my ass showing?

14:13.542 --> 14:15.544
It's fine!

14:17.250 --> 14:19.719
Awesome underwear, by the way.

14:22.125 --> 14:23.342
God, you smell of alcohol!

14:25.333 --> 14:27.461
I was at a bachelorette party.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.627
Tie it down.

14:37.583 --> 14:39.301
Mr. Miller?

14:41.708 --> 14:44.052
For god's sake, not around the statue!

14:50.792 --> 14:53.841
Shit, whose car was that?
- Mine!

14:55.042 --> 14:56.669
Poor Che.

14:56.917 --> 14:58.840
Fallen a second time.

15:03.208 --> 15:04.960
It was your idea?

15:28.750 --> 15:30.673
That was the last straw.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.469
Okay, some of you belong in my class.
Raffael,

15:33.625 --> 15:36.253
eraser out of your nose
before Simon can hit...

15:37.708 --> 15:41.167
Ms. Enzberger!
- Eraser operation inside my classroom.

15:41.500 --> 15:44.959
What requirements do I need to meet?
- I was afraid you'd ask.

15:45.583 --> 15:48.257
I only hope the other grade levels
are better.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.593
I was against it.

16:01.292 --> 16:02.544
What is that!

16:04.583 --> 16:06.756
No, Ms. Leimbach-Knorr,

16:07.083 --> 16:09.506
not with my files!
- Hey, are you crazy?

16:09.667 --> 16:12.170
Okay, let's forget about Bunsen burners,

16:12.500 --> 16:14.798
but this stays between us!
- Gudrun?

16:15.125 --> 16:18.095
This is war.
How on earth can I hide this?

16:18.417 --> 16:20.636
Eckhart!
- Out of my way!

16:20.958 --> 16:23.461
Mr. Miller?
Did your students do this?

16:23.792 --> 16:27.501
They're mad about the JIC.
- What are you talking about?

16:27.833 --> 16:29.676
Turn that off!

16:48.167 --> 16:51.922
<i>Children, we had a technical incident.
Class is canceled today.</i>

16:55.625 --> 16:57.093
Damned stuff is so sticky.

17:03.167 --> 17:06.467
Why did you become a teacher, anyway?
I've always wondered that.

17:06.625 --> 17:08.502
It's just temporary.

17:09.125 --> 17:11.548
With the money I earn
I'll open a beach bar one day.

17:11.875 --> 17:14.627
The job fulfills me.
It feels good

17:14.958 --> 17:17.837
to set things straight that go wrong
at home. You can still mold them,

17:18.166 --> 17:22.297
make real people out of them.
- The way you're always hugging them.

17:22.666 --> 17:24.464
They have diseases, and fleas.

17:25.291 --> 17:28.296
I know.
The minute you have physical contact,

17:28.625 --> 17:32.880
once one of those little shits hugs you,
that's it. Trapped. Teacher forever.

17:33.625 --> 17:36.299
I always feel more like hitting them.

17:40.458 --> 17:42.335
The Culture Minister is furious.

17:42.667 --> 17:47.002
We have four weeks to comply, or our school
will be closed by the end of the year.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.920
Outrageous!
- Will we get paid vacation then?

17:50.625 --> 17:52.423
I want us to fight this!

17:52.750 --> 17:54.502
Mr. Gundlach, must you really eat now?

17:54.833 --> 17:57.916
The room always smells of sausage spread.
- It's my break.

17:58.083 --> 18:00.711
You teach history,
you're always on break.

18:00.875 --> 18:03.003
All you do is watch Spiegel TV.

18:08.958 --> 18:10.335
But drinking is allowed, isn't it?

18:10.667 --> 18:13.967
Who would build a drone with minors?

18:14.875 --> 18:18.425
It worked fine. Who said
I had to make key racks and ashtrays?

18:18.750 --> 18:22.755
The requirements seem quite extensive.
- We need a competition,

18:23.083 --> 18:26.917
in which we get at least second place.
A student newspaper,

18:27.250 --> 18:28.843
or math olympics. Good luck!

18:29.167 --> 18:32.717
Eckhart wants an anti-bullying campaign
that goes viral, with a hashtag.

18:33.042 --> 18:36.171
That one's on you, Ms. Enzberger.
You used the word 'bullying'.

18:36.500 --> 18:38.377
You take care of it.
- Excuse me?

18:38.542 --> 18:41.261
I get the feeling I'm being
thrown in the same pot as Mr. Miller.

18:41.417 --> 18:46.093
Yes, and now there's fire under the pot.
- I said I was being bullied months ago.

18:46.417 --> 18:47.885
The students, Ingrid.

18:48.458 --> 18:53.009
So, do I get a budget? I already bought
toner and toilet paper out of pocket.

18:53.167 --> 18:57.092
I was wondering why it's 4-ply.
- That's from you? Thank you.

18:57.417 --> 19:00.591
Yes, you can take the earnings
from the refugee flea market.

19:00.917 --> 19:04.376
Then we need a musical scholarship
for an 11th grader,

19:04.708 --> 19:07.917
and five new registrations
for next school year,

19:08.250 --> 19:10.878
to stay above
the minimum number of pupils.

19:11.208 --> 19:12.710
That's absurd. How?

19:13.042 --> 19:15.136
No, I'd rather apply elsewhere.

19:15.458 --> 19:19.088
Or just retire, Ingrid.
That would benefit the next school, too.

19:19.417 --> 19:22.045
Can we please stick together?
This is our school!

19:22.208 --> 19:23.676
I saved the best for last:

19:25.083 --> 19:29.463
A performance test for the 11th grade!
To see if they'll qualify for 12th grade.

19:29.625 --> 19:31.878
If the average is too low,
the school closes.

19:32.583 --> 19:36.133
Well, I doubt that'll work.
What if we just expel the dummies?

19:36.458 --> 19:39.917
Haven't you been listening?
We're already short on students as it is.

19:40.708 --> 19:43.552
So work with
the available student material.

19:43.708 --> 19:46.382
It's really the pinnacle of irony

19:46.708 --> 19:48.802
that you of all people were elected
Teacher of the Year.

19:52.333 --> 19:54.711
It was a mistake to believe in you.

19:57.833 --> 20:00.507
Mr. Miller?
If you don't meet the requirements,

20:00.667 --> 20:02.840
I'll report you to the police for forgery,

20:03.167 --> 20:05.420
lies, and endangering the minors

20:05.750 --> 20:09.209
whom you shouldn't have been teaching
with your criminal record!

20:09.542 --> 20:11.920
Because if I go to Brandenburg,

20:12.250 --> 20:14.378
then you're going back to jail.

20:15.167 --> 20:17.420
Now get cleaning.
It was your class, after all.

20:17.583 --> 20:21.213
I want smart solutions.
Elite doesn't come about by force.

20:21.500 --> 20:23.298
I want to see results in four weeks.

20:30.208 --> 20:33.337
Oh my god!
What happened here, Mr. Miller?

20:34.000 --> 20:38.005
Where were you yesterday noon?
- At my place. The JIC bummed us out.

20:38.417 --> 20:40.761
That damned job center means nothing.

20:40.917 --> 20:44.171
Now start cleaning. I don't want stress.
- Why should we clean?

20:44.333 --> 20:47.416
Because you did it!
I got chewed out!

20:48.417 --> 20:49.418
Well,

20:49.750 --> 20:53.334
maybe you shouldn't have given us
so many empty promises.

20:53.500 --> 20:55.468
Was Ms. Gerster very angry?

20:55.792 --> 20:58.011
Get started,
then we have to talk.

20:58.167 --> 20:59.965
There's a performance test for 12th grade.

21:00.292 --> 21:01.544
What?
- No!

21:01.750 --> 21:03.593
So all of a sudden it's not sure?

21:03.917 --> 21:07.251
You promised!
- Then there's no use in coming at all!

21:09.708 --> 21:11.210
Hello, there.
- Hi.

21:12.458 --> 21:16.213
Ms. Drispenstedt from the School
Health Office is here to vaccinate you.

21:17.292 --> 21:19.670
Hello, children.
- Huh? That's a first.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.300
Because you've never been vaccinated.

21:23.625 --> 21:26.174
It's a vaccine against ticks, meningitis

21:26.500 --> 21:28.844
and mental disabilities.

21:29.167 --> 21:31.886
Yes, Chantal, you might ask,
"isn't it too late for that?"

21:37.750 --> 21:40.378
Ow.
- See how slow he reacted?

21:40.542 --> 21:44.092
Why does it say "D-O..."

21:45.000 --> 21:46.593
"Dog"?
- Dog.

21:46.917 --> 21:49.215
That's short for? Who knows it?

21:50.875 --> 21:52.127
I know! Doctor!

21:53.792 --> 21:54.759
<i>Super, Chant“.!</i>

21:55.083 --> 21:58.257
You've learned all you need to know.
You're ready for life.

22:00.167 --> 22:03.341
I googled it!
It's a device for implanting chips in dogs!

22:03.667 --> 22:06.011
Are you crazy, Mr. Miller? Take it out!

22:06.333 --> 22:08.176
No! What if I grow fur?

22:10.375 --> 22:13.424
Stop him! Or do you want to be
the only one forced to go to class?

22:13.750 --> 22:15.752
No, bro!
- Want to sit here all alone?

22:16.083 --> 22:18.051
No, let go!
- Leave me alone!

22:18.750 --> 22:20.377
Please don't, Mr. Miller!

22:21.333 --> 22:23.051
The cooker spaniel is next.

22:24.208 --> 22:25.505
No, no, please!

22:27.917 --> 22:29.544
Hand these out!
- What is it?

22:30.417 --> 22:32.966
The curriculum you have to work over.

22:33.125 --> 22:36.834
But that's for teachers to do.
- You think I'd ruin my afternoon?

22:37.000 --> 22:41.380
As of now, you come to school,
or I'll find you. No more fucking with me!

22:42.083 --> 22:44.802
He just pretended to implant a chip
in our neck.

22:44.958 --> 22:47.586
That would be totally illegal.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.169
Same thing tomorrow?

23:39.500 --> 23:40.797
No, no!

23:41.125 --> 23:43.628
Seriously, you guys are a nightmare.

23:43.792 --> 23:47.422
Like children that weren't aborted
in time. But I like you anyway.

23:48.625 --> 23:50.252
I'll take care of you till you die.

23:51.333 --> 23:52.505
Or till you graduate.

23:53.125 --> 23:55.548
With A-levels, damn it!

23:56.208 --> 23:58.711
I won't go back to jail because of you.

23:58.958 --> 24:01.427
So nice to see you all here.

24:17.042 --> 24:18.589
That's not a job.

24:18.750 --> 24:21.469
We never had this question in class!
- Yeah!

24:21.625 --> 24:23.468
Because it's something you should know.

24:24.083 --> 24:26.051
Don't you have any dreams?
- We do!

24:26.375 --> 24:27.877
But not about jobs.

24:35.333 --> 24:38.086
One of you has to do something musical.
- But I'm Christian.

24:39.875 --> 24:40.842
Seriously?

24:41.167 --> 24:45.297
You broke a GCS school rule,
and you endanger the community.

24:45.458 --> 24:48.462
Fuck off.
- Your photo was sent to the principal.

24:51.042 --> 24:53.545
Why don't you have any goals?
Why don't you fight?

24:53.875 --> 24:57.209
What kind of kids are you?
- What kind of teacher are you?

24:57.542 --> 24:59.840
It's your fault
if we're 'prospectless'.

25:05.958 --> 25:08.586
Miller's students need success.
I always say "Awesome!"

25:08.917 --> 25:12.046
"You are awesome!"
It's all about love and affirmation.

25:12.542 --> 25:14.965
Just getting them interested.
It's not about winning.

25:15.292 --> 25:17.545
Yes, it is. In three weeks
is the newspaper competition.

25:17.875 --> 25:20.424
I've brought some copies
of the "Class Fart".

25:20.583 --> 25:21.675
Awful..

25:22.250 --> 25:24.002
Who's going to deal with it?

25:28.292 --> 25:30.010
Can't I do Science Club?

25:30.250 --> 25:32.048
No, the deadline has passed.

25:32.208 --> 25:37.089
There's an art scholarship program,
but only for outstanding achievements.

25:37.417 --> 25:39.920
I can just see your class,

25:40.083 --> 25:43.292
painting a giant selfie
with a Picasso filter.

25:44.417 --> 25:45.509
Very funny.

25:46.625 --> 25:50.835
How can I put any of them in a competition?
They're so unmotivated!

25:52.417 --> 25:55.091
Mr. Miller,
don't use up all the oxygen, okay?

25:57.083 --> 25:59.085
Who's going
to the elementary school tomorrow?

25:59.417 --> 26:01.886
Mr. Miller can go.
- Sure.

26:04.125 --> 26:05.126
What for?

26:05.458 --> 26:08.257
Because the kids all want to go
to other schools.

26:08.583 --> 26:12.338
Because no one recommends us!
Go there and recruit a few students.

26:12.625 --> 26:15.128
Do an info-event, or whatever,

26:15.292 --> 26:18.466
just make sure they tell their parents
how great the GCS is.

26:35.875 --> 26:37.627
Miller, GCS.

26:41.417 --> 26:42.919
So you're Mr. Miller.

26:43.250 --> 26:45.878
Welcome to elementary school.
- Yeah, I'm thrilled.

26:46.042 --> 26:49.672
We were going outside to collect leaves.
But surely you've prepared something?

26:53.250 --> 26:55.503
Are they Siamese twins?

26:55.667 --> 26:59.342
Kevin, I said to leave the glue
on the teacher's desk.

26:59.875 --> 27:02.628
Show Mr. Miller to the boys' room.
He'll help you clean up.

27:02.958 --> 27:06.963
Hold on, I'm not an errand boy.
- Well, I've got other things to do, myself.

27:07.292 --> 27:08.839
So if there's a problem...

27:09.167 --> 27:11.135
don't call me.

27:15.542 --> 27:18.136
Where's the restroom?

27:18.292 --> 27:20.545
This way.
- Ow!

27:23.250 --> 27:25.503
Shut up or I'll cut off your braids.

27:30.542 --> 27:33.842
What are you grinning at?
- My sister is transsexual.

27:34.333 --> 27:35.334
What can I say?

27:35.667 --> 27:39.422
She wants a penis.
I said she can have mine.

27:39.583 --> 27:41.961
But my mom said it won't grow back,

27:42.125 --> 27:45.709
and that she shouldn't watch
so many series on Amazonia.

27:45.875 --> 27:49.300
Very interesting,
but you're slobbering on my hand.

28:16.917 --> 28:18.214
Why do you do that?

28:18.917 --> 28:22.217
I'm shaking it off so your teacher
will want to put it in her mouth later.

28:26.500 --> 28:29.709
Okay, so who knows
what their next school will be?

28:29.875 --> 28:32.378
Heinrich B6II!
- Schiller High School!

28:33.000 --> 28:34.297
Schiller High School.

28:34.458 --> 28:36.881
Ever heard of
the Goethe Comprehensive School?

28:37.208 --> 28:38.755
No.

28:38.917 --> 28:41.966
My brother goes there.
He gets beat up because he's so fat.

28:42.292 --> 28:45.262
It's a really shitty school.
- Well, uh... Come on.

28:45.583 --> 28:48.211
Look, I have really cool stickers
from the GCS.

28:48.542 --> 28:50.294
To put on your schoolbags.

28:51.875 --> 28:53.673
Calm down,
are you from the East or what?

28:54.667 --> 28:56.544
Hey, one is enough!

28:56.875 --> 28:58.297
Awesome!

28:59.833 --> 29:02.962
Just tell your parents I was nice,
our teachers are great,

29:03.292 --> 29:05.135
and the GCS is awesome.

29:07.042 --> 29:09.295
What's all that?
- We chose our professions.

29:09.458 --> 29:11.927
I'm going to be a molecular biologist!

29:13.958 --> 29:15.926
ARCHITECT...
MOLECULAR BIOLOGIST

29:17.583 --> 29:20.086
You all know
what you want to be later?

29:20.375 --> 29:21.592
Racecar driver!
- Soccer player!

29:21.917 --> 29:23.464
Architect!
- Singer!

29:23.625 --> 29:26.003
Want to see our work clothes?
- Yeah!

29:32.083 --> 29:35.587
Now write down what's so great
about your job, with lots of enthusiasm.

29:37.000 --> 29:37.842
All right?

29:47.208 --> 29:48.801
Finished.
- Great.

29:49.375 --> 29:52.709
Later we'll guess
who wrote what. So make sure you sign

29:53.042 --> 29:55.170
with these wrong names up here.

29:57.208 --> 29:59.586
Funny names.
- Just do it.

29:59.917 --> 30:00.839
Okay.

30:05.667 --> 30:07.510
Architect, huh?

30:08.500 --> 30:09.968
WHAT I WANT TO BECOME

30:10.792 --> 30:12.510
No date!
Erase the date.

30:13.125 --> 30:15.173
We're not allowed to use ink erasers.

30:15.500 --> 30:16.752
Well, today you are.

30:17.000 --> 30:20.584
At the GCS,
students are allowed to use ink erasers!

30:21.250 --> 30:24.584
I love that school already.
Are all the teachers there refugees?

30:30.708 --> 30:32.881
Oh my god, where did you get this?

30:33.208 --> 30:36.087
I got them from your elementary schools.

30:36.583 --> 30:39.587
To remind you
that you weren't always so unmotivated.

30:39.917 --> 30:41.510
You were excited!

30:41.667 --> 30:44.295
My nickname was Danger back then already?

30:44.625 --> 30:46.093
It wasn't.

30:46.417 --> 30:47.794
It says so here.
- Let's see.

30:48.125 --> 30:50.219
How cute you drew yourself, Chanti.

30:50.542 --> 30:54.251
What did you want to be?
- Journalist... journalist!

30:54.417 --> 30:57.546
But why did I give myself black hair?

30:57.708 --> 30:59.756
Maybe you were drawing me.
- Yeah!

31:00.083 --> 31:01.505
Remember?
- Yeah.

31:01.833 --> 31:03.255
Nice.

31:03.583 --> 31:06.587
Shit, I remember when we did this.
I was so excited.

31:06.917 --> 31:08.965
About what?
- About being a singer.

31:09.292 --> 31:10.885
Yeah, right.

31:11.333 --> 31:14.667
"Whenever I sing to my teachers,
they get tears in their eyes..."

31:15.000 --> 31:18.083
Because it was so bad!
and tell me I should study music."

31:18.250 --> 31:21.379
Wow, Zeynep.
- Yeah, but I guess I stopped at some point.

31:21.708 --> 31:23.710
But now you'll stick with it, right?

31:23.875 --> 31:25.877
"Ar-chee..."

31:26.750 --> 31:28.878
<i>“ tent“. Archeetect.</i>

31:29.208 --> 31:31.552
It's so crazy that you forget this.

31:31.875 --> 31:34.094
We used to have dreams, bro.

31:35.208 --> 31:38.667
Okay, here's the deal...
- I know I was typing in 3rd grade.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.422
Something crawled into your ear.

31:40.750 --> 31:43.253
If we set our minds
to achieving your dreams,

32:05.125 --> 32:06.172
CHOIR CLUB

32:11.167 --> 32:12.714
ART CLUB

32:23.917 --> 32:24.918
SCHOOL RADIO

32:25.250 --> 32:27.799
<i>And now, for you, my favorite song...</i>

32:30.250 --> 32:31.502
She's so bad.

32:37.292 --> 32:39.511
Hi, I'm Chantal.

32:40.375 --> 32:43.379
Are you the other editors.
- Uh-huh.

32:44.500 --> 32:46.673
I could write something about beauty.

32:46.833 --> 32:50.838
Do whatever you want.
We're only here because there's a TV.

32:51.167 --> 32:54.046
Whatever.
I'm the head reporter now.

32:54.583 --> 32:56.460
And I hate drugs.

32:57.042 --> 32:58.669
Joke.

33:03.208 --> 33:06.712
"And then you finish it off
with a touch of glitter."

33:06.875 --> 33:10.425
But do you think that will win a prize?
It's pretty superficial.

33:11.958 --> 33:15.167
We've been chilling for quite a while.
I mean, without any action.

33:16.542 --> 33:18.590
Quiet! The film is on.

33:21.750 --> 33:24.253
We've already watched
Lord of the Rings so often!

33:24.583 --> 33:26.927
I'll grow hair on my feet
if I see another Hobbit.

33:27.167 --> 33:30.137
<i>In the life of an Elf.
I'm patient.</i>

33:30.458 --> 33:33.337
<i>I can wait!</i>

33:37.917 --> 33:40.466
Ploppi? Ploppi, come on.

33:40.833 --> 33:42.380
With tongue, just once.

33:42.833 --> 33:45.427
<i>The Arkenstone!</i>

33:47.292 --> 33:49.841
<i>It is precious to you beyond measure.</i>

33:51.583 --> 33:53.585
No, I can't. Too much saliva.

33:55.458 --> 33:58.337
If we can never have sex,
we'll have to break up.

34:02.333 --> 34:04.256
The way you said...

34:04.667 --> 34:06.635
n, "Sex"!

34:06.958 --> 34:09.837
Petting, at least?
- With a finger?

34:10.458 --> 34:11.583
Yes, for example.

34:13.042 --> 34:14.668
That would be unhygienic.

34:14.833 --> 34:18.632
Into someone else's body.
That can't be right, Chantal.

34:19.083 --> 34:20.755
Even the word: "petting."

34:23.208 --> 34:24.050
Chantal?

34:30.167 --> 34:31.384
OK, art club members,

34:31.542 --> 34:34.386
look around and gather inspiration
for your own...

34:34.542 --> 34:35.759
well, art.

34:36.083 --> 34:39.007
I want one of you
to get a scholarship, okay?

34:39.167 --> 34:41.670
Great exhibit.

34:56.708 --> 34:59.552
That's the title.
- Why do artists do that?

35:00.500 --> 35:02.923
It expresses something.
- But what?

35:03.083 --> 35:06.462
Why can't they just say what they mean?

35:06.792 --> 35:08.590
Because they can't say it any other way.

35:08.917 --> 35:12.251
They're like you, they don't
have enough words for a full sentence,

35:12.417 --> 35:14.511
so they use paint and glue instead.

35:14.833 --> 35:16.756
Think about what you want to say.

35:17.083 --> 35:19.836
If he has anything to say.

35:20.667 --> 35:23.090
I wonder where the bistro is?

35:44.625 --> 35:46.753
Think about what you see, take notes,

35:46.917 --> 35:48.669
I expect great presentations.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.970
I considered studying art history.

35:53.042 --> 35:56.171
I studied art history,
then decided to be a teacher.

35:56.500 --> 35:58.298
Really?
- It doesn't pay.

36:00.833 --> 36:03.916
What is this?
Are you crazy? Get this off me at once!

36:06.083 --> 36:09.053
Ms. Leimbach-Knorr, stop!
- Help! I bet this was Daniel!

36:09.375 --> 36:11.924
No respect for teachers.

36:15.250 --> 36:17.753
Outrageous! It was you!

36:35.292 --> 36:37.511
A plastic piece of shit.

36:57.458 --> 36:59.051
OCCUPIED

36:59.667 --> 37:00.668
Strange.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.423
BIG BUSINESS IN THE COLD WAR

37:03.750 --> 37:06.128
Here we have an unusual,

37:06.458 --> 37:09.337
yes, somehow angry installation.

37:09.667 --> 37:10.793
"Piece of Shit".

37:11.125 --> 37:15.460
Next to it, the artist examines
the interiors of intellectual bourgeoisie.

37:16.083 --> 37:19.087
Note above all the poignant irony

37:19.417 --> 37:21.840
in the magazine titles in this artwork.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.209
The topics of these magazines
are biting commentary

37:25.542 --> 37:28.546
on the zeitgeist of the '80s...

37:30.208 --> 37:31.710
It's occupied, girl!

37:35.083 --> 37:37.336
Number one or number two?

37:42.333 --> 37:44.711
PUPIL SHITS ON MODERN ART

38:01.708 --> 38:04.427
This isn't about you, Ingrid,
it's about the school!

38:04.583 --> 38:06.836
It's never about me!

38:08.542 --> 38:10.465
The ice is getting thin.

38:10.792 --> 38:12.886
What about the newspaper?
- Chantal is on it,

38:13.208 --> 38:14.801
now it has a double cover.

38:15.125 --> 38:18.208
I know. Most of the articles
are interviews with herself.

38:38.792 --> 38:42.001
Fact is, I'm the one
who has to deal with those morons.

38:42.375 --> 38:45.675
Can't you say something nice for once?
- You have nice hair.

38:49.375 --> 38:52.709
Maybe I'd actually be a good teacher
if someone here believed in me.

38:53.375 --> 38:58.461
How about a demonstration lesson?
No problem. What do you want this to be?

38:58.792 --> 39:01.796
A guest appearance, or a profession?

39:03.083 --> 39:04.255
Well.

39:09.167 --> 39:10.760
Smaller, Danger.

39:17.250 --> 39:19.548
Why not do your demonstration lesson?

39:21.875 --> 39:24.219
Don't you want to find out
if you can do it?

39:47.542 --> 39:50.625
My name is Afuk, and...

39:51.167 --> 39:54.296
I am in Germany since three months.

39:54.625 --> 39:57.378
My name's Danger
and I've been here for 17 years.

39:57.708 --> 39:59.460
Why he here?
- Yeah, why?

39:59.792 --> 40:01.669
Your German is as bad
as these coconut pickers.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.083
But you didn't have to swallow
liters of water to get here

40:05.250 --> 40:07.799
Hey, Justin is jumping off the roof!

40:12.000 --> 40:13.422
Jump!

40:19.167 --> 40:22.546
This is for all those
who don't believe in superpowers!

40:25.000 --> 40:26.377
Justin!

40:39.375 --> 40:40.843
Justin? Justin!

40:41.583 --> 40:44.086
I didn't fly, did I?
- How many fingers?

40:44.250 --> 40:46.548
Three?
- Can't be that bad.

40:48.292 --> 40:49.760
My leg hurts a bit.

40:58.208 --> 40:59.425
Hello.

40:59.583 --> 41:02.587
Hey. When is your mom coming?

41:03.125 --> 41:04.593
Soon.

41:04.750 --> 41:07.253
She's still working.
But I told her

41:07.583 --> 41:09.756
it doesn't hurt so much.

41:10.083 --> 41:11.881
That's not true, is it?

41:37.083 --> 41:39.302
Justin. Hello.

41:39.458 --> 41:41.677
Hello.
- Mom!

41:41.833 --> 41:43.085
Biggi!

41:43.375 --> 41:46.629
I felt sorry for him.
- Now it happened. You want to be a teacher.

41:46.792 --> 41:48.886
Knock it off.
- Teacher. He's a teacher,

41:49.208 --> 41:51.586
and he always will be.
- No way.

42:22.583 --> 42:24.551
Powering up.

42:27.333 --> 42:29.256
Now put on the goggles.

42:33.167 --> 42:35.295
Oh, Ploppi!

42:42.167 --> 42:44.044
Oh. No, Chantal!
- Ploppi!

42:56.833 --> 42:58.506
Pow.

42:59.875 --> 43:02.378
Won't you try a cookie?
- Now's a bad time.

43:15.875 --> 43:17.969
Are they yummy?
- Chantal?

43:18.292 --> 43:20.465
Do you want one too?

43:24.917 --> 43:28.547
If it's so fun, maybe we can
play it with Grandpa sometime.

43:29.833 --> 43:31.005
Sure, Grandma.

43:44.250 --> 43:46.469
We just had sex with your Grandma.

43:51.000 --> 43:54.925
Don't get me wrong, Ploppi.
The fantasy films and chips are great,

43:55.083 --> 43:57.381
but I don't want to have cybersex
for the rest of my life.

43:57.708 --> 44:01.633
I didn't even want to date you,
but you were so dominant.

44:01.958 --> 44:04.552
Sorry, I thought you wanted it too.

44:06.833 --> 44:09.757
Don't you ever
want to touch a girl for real?

44:12.000 --> 44:14.094
Is there someone else?

44:14.375 --> 44:16.343
Ploppi! Tell me!
- Chantal...

44:16.667 --> 44:17.884
Tell me.
- No, get off!

44:18.208 --> 44:19.460
Or I'll have to kiss you.

44:19.792 --> 44:21.339
No! There was a girl!

44:22.583 --> 44:24.210
Amrei.

44:25.500 --> 44:29.084
We were in the math olympics together,
and she was so good with numbers.

44:50.458 --> 44:52.460
Get off. Off!

44:57.083 --> 44:58.585
I don't think she even likes me.

45:04.625 --> 45:07.253
It really smells like
primary numbers here.

45:08.667 --> 45:11.591
Anyway, I don't need my pussy
wired every week.

45:11.750 --> 45:14.549
So I thought I'd help Ploppi
hook up with that Amrei.

45:14.875 --> 45:17.173
If she's disabled too,
it's a perfect match.

45:17.500 --> 45:19.798
Is she that emo chick from Schiller
who got sent to therapy

45:19.958 --> 45:22.586
for biking on the highway?
- I'll contact her.

45:22.917 --> 45:25.420
She won't talk to you.
They hate pretty kids.

45:25.583 --> 45:29.918
You still have those ugly boots?
The ones that look like they're Hitler's?

45:30.250 --> 45:32.503
Oh, you have them on.
Can I borrow them?

45:32.833 --> 45:35.131
Gimme a smoke.
- Don't have any.

45:36.500 --> 45:37.717
Mr. Miller, no!

45:38.042 --> 45:39.294
See you.
- No! -Chill!

45:39.625 --> 45:41.548
Not those.
- What's the matter?

45:41.708 --> 45:43.710
Not those, Mr. Miller.

45:43.875 --> 45:45.502
Mr. Miller!

46:08.292 --> 46:10.420
Just one more drag.
- You used to be addicted!

46:10.750 --> 46:11.922
Just one.

46:12.250 --> 46:13.547
No!
"Run!

46:13.875 --> 46:16.344
Drugs are not good for you!

46:26.292 --> 46:29.967
Something bad has happened!
Mr. Miller took crack and now he snapped!

46:39.917 --> 46:41.385
Have you seen Chantal?

46:44.750 --> 46:46.343
Find Chantal for me, okay?
- What?

46:46.500 --> 46:48.127
Come on, let's find her.

46:48.458 --> 46:49.459
Go.
- I see.

46:49.792 --> 46:52.341
We're a team!
- We have to get him to come down.

46:52.667 --> 46:53.509
But how?

46:53.833 --> 46:55.335
Not with an injection.

46:55.667 --> 46:57.761
I don't have <i>that</i> with me.

46:58.083 --> 47:00.051
My mom took <i>that</i> away.

47:00.375 --> 47:04.505
Diazepam is the only quick remedy.
He'll be calm, and with a pulse.

47:04.667 --> 47:08.501
But it's a rectal suppository.
- How will we stick it up his ass?

47:08.833 --> 47:10.927
Well, it's doable.

47:28.125 --> 47:30.093
You assholes!
Untie me now!

47:30.417 --> 47:33.387
Whoever does it is going to get it back.
- Gerster can't see him like this.

47:33.542 --> 47:36.261
Danger, pull his pants down.
- What if he farts?

47:36.417 --> 47:38.044
Then we won't smell your sweat.

47:38.375 --> 47:42.050
It's not my fault.
The doctor said it's testastatrone!

47:45.125 --> 47:47.219
Oh my god, it's huge.
- I'm out!

47:47.542 --> 47:49.544
I'll do it.

47:50.792 --> 47:53.921
Grandma always puts Nivea on it.
- Gimme your lip gloss.

47:54.083 --> 47:57.508
No, it was expensive!
Gigi Hadid uses it on Snapchat!

48:00.750 --> 48:02.548
Go ahead, use it up!

48:02.708 --> 48:04.551
It's important.

48:13.542 --> 48:16.170
Mr. Miller? Relax your anus.

48:24.500 --> 48:25.467
<i>Ow'. Chant“!</i>

48:26.042 --> 48:27.919
Then you have to make him swallow it.

48:28.250 --> 48:31.299
But I don't know
how that will change the effect.

48:32.667 --> 48:34.965
You fuckers, gimme the shit
and I'll forget this...

48:35.292 --> 48:37.090
It's the drug speaking, not you.

48:37.250 --> 48:39.673
Now swallow it.
- Or suffocate!

48:42.417 --> 48:44.044
You guys are sick.

48:48.750 --> 48:50.502
Fuck off!

48:53.167 --> 48:55.261
Mr. Miller!

48:55.917 --> 48:57.715
He's out of it!

48:58.042 --> 48:59.589
What's going on?

49:01.542 --> 49:03.340
Ms. Gerster's coming!
- No!

49:05.667 --> 49:06.964
Danger?

49:19.375 --> 49:21.673
You're killing him!

49:36.250 --> 49:37.376
Hi.
- Hey.

49:37.542 --> 49:38.634
$0?
"$0?

49:42.208 --> 49:46.338
Now don't be silly.
I need a few signatures for insurance.

49:47.750 --> 49:50.253
My pleasure.
- Good.

49:53.583 --> 49:55.256
Why are you sweating?

49:56.625 --> 49:58.719
Because it's hot.
- Uh-huh.

49:59.833 --> 50:00.880
A hot topic.

50:02.500 --> 50:05.549
We're on it.
We're in the fast lane!

50:07.208 --> 50:11.008
So motivated, huh?
- Most def. Hey, Gerster!

50:11.333 --> 50:12.755
Careful, okay?

50:13.083 --> 50:15.711
How about that demonstration lesson?
- Yeah, right.

50:18.708 --> 50:22.042
Demonstration lesson!
Demonstration lesson!

50:22.208 --> 50:24.802
Demonstration lesson!
- Are you serious?

50:28.708 --> 50:30.961
I'm a good teacher.

50:31.292 --> 50:33.420
I can do it. Really!

50:33.750 --> 50:36.594
I want you to be proud of me.
- Well...

50:36.750 --> 50:38.673
Yes. Mr. Miller,

50:39.208 --> 50:41.882
I'm glad you see this
as something long-term.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.048
Very well, I'll check the schedule.

50:55.625 --> 50:57.002
Yes!

50:57.333 --> 50:58.505
<i>Wake up!</i>

51:25.833 --> 51:27.380
Demonstration lesson!

51:30.542 --> 51:31.714
Oh, god.

51:33.708 --> 51:35.051
Out!

51:35.375 --> 51:39.005
No, not you! Where did you get it?
Do you take it?

51:39.333 --> 51:42.382
What are you yelling for?
- She had crack with her.

51:43.542 --> 51:46.842
Why didn't you tell me?
We have procedures for this.

51:47.167 --> 51:50.137
How long have you been taking the drug?
- Not at all.

51:53.708 --> 51:56.587
The cigarettes
are from my mom's boyfriend.

51:56.750 --> 51:58.377
Is that so?

51:59.375 --> 52:03.255
I... I steal them from her sometimes
so she can't smoke with him.

52:03.833 --> 52:06.382
She scares me when she smokes it.
She trips out.

52:11.125 --> 52:13.753
I don't want to be the one
with the crack mom.

52:19.875 --> 52:23.550
This frazzles me out more than the finals
of Germany's Next Top Model.

52:25.417 --> 52:28.921
There's something else. Mr. Miller.
- What else?

52:31.417 --> 52:35.217
I stole 250 euros
from Ms. Enzberger's cubicle.

52:35.542 --> 52:37.215
Who cares?

52:37.542 --> 52:39.135
Oh, uh, well...

52:39.292 --> 52:41.636
Why?
- Stealing just sucks.

52:41.792 --> 52:44.011
I'll pay it back from the competition,
I swear.

52:44.167 --> 52:46.886
What did you buy with the money, make-up?
- No!

52:48.208 --> 52:49.209
No.

52:50.583 --> 52:54.258
My mom wants me to pay her rent
as long as I'm not working.

52:56.167 --> 52:58.716
She doesn't want me to go to school.

52:58.875 --> 53:01.924
She says it's wasted on me.
- Yeah.

53:11.667 --> 53:13.465
This is it.

53:13.625 --> 53:15.923
If I freak out, you just give a cough.

53:19.375 --> 53:22.584
Hey, by law she's old enough
to leave school.

53:22.917 --> 53:27.047
Maybe no one told you, but not everyone
quits after 9th grade.

53:28.167 --> 53:31.250
You watch your tone of voice.
Who do you think you are, anyway?

53:31.750 --> 53:35.209
You can't fool kids into thinking
they can pass their A-levels.

53:35.375 --> 53:36.922
I'll tell you something:

53:37.083 --> 53:40.542
My sister, my half-sisters,
the other half-sister,

53:40.708 --> 53:44.212
all my cousins and my 2nd cousin,
Chantal's dad, that is,

53:44.542 --> 53:47.876
none of them graduated
And we're doing just fine.

53:48.208 --> 53:50.586
We went and got our hands dirty.

53:50.750 --> 53:53.924
We learned how to work.
And so can she.

53:54.083 --> 53:59.089
Mom, I can help out after school.
- No! Young lady, we talked about this!

53:59.750 --> 54:02.378
I'm so fed up with this crap!

54:03.042 --> 54:06.251
Always hanging out at school,
doing nothing, earning nothing.

54:06.417 --> 54:09.261
I have to support her.
But the fact is,

54:09.417 --> 54:12.466
we all know
she's too dumb for A-levels.

54:12.792 --> 54:15.341
And now fuck off.
- You want me to fuck off?

54:15.667 --> 54:19.797
You think I can't handle you intellectuals?
- You can fuck off!

54:20.125 --> 54:23.755
You want me to sue you?
- Yeah, go right ahead.

54:23.917 --> 54:27.251
But it smells like
you spent your legal budget on liquor.

54:27.417 --> 54:30.967
Your breath reeks so bad,
I don't dare light a cigarette.

54:43.667 --> 54:45.135
Is this how...
- Hey!

54:45.458 --> 54:48.132
I didn't want off-duty stress,
but this is going too far.

54:48.458 --> 54:50.210
Shut your trap, you...

54:51.833 --> 54:55.042
Now you listen to me:
If Chantal comes to school

54:55.375 --> 54:58.675
with a single bruise,
or if you throw one more thing at her,

54:59.000 --> 55:02.550
the public health department
will pay you a visit,

55:02.875 --> 55:05.845
and your filthy, piss-reeking pub
will be shut in no time.

55:07.708 --> 55:10.257
And if your boyfriend
brings drugs home again,

55:10.583 --> 55:12.460
or takes drugs in front of Chantal,

55:12.792 --> 55:15.762
he will stop by with some buddies
and burn the whole place down.

55:19.083 --> 55:20.380
Well.

55:20.708 --> 55:23.336
What a productive
parent-teacher talk that was.

55:23.667 --> 55:27.422
I think it's time for lunch. Chantal?
- What are we having?

55:27.750 --> 55:29.752
Pizza.
- Vegetables would be good.

55:30.083 --> 55:31.676
And vegetables.

55:37.625 --> 55:39.172
Hi, Zeki.

55:39.917 --> 55:43.000
Hey, Jackie.
Make me a Bloody Mary, will you?

55:44.375 --> 55:45.843
I'm still drunk.

55:48.125 --> 55:50.378
I always thought,
what good is Judo?

55:50.708 --> 55:53.757
Judo, Judo, Judo, I thought,
it's way too physical!

55:54.583 --> 55:56.756
Can you buckle up, please?

55:57.417 --> 56:00.261
Remind me to let you take over
my parent conferences.

56:01.000 --> 56:02.172
Two-fifty.

56:09.167 --> 56:10.919
<i>Whassap? I want to party tonight.</i>

56:11.125 --> 56:14.925
She's crazy. She just dodged
a beer glass, now she wants to party.

56:15.417 --> 56:18.967
Are you in a WhatsApp group with them?
- I tapped Chantal's phone.

56:19.292 --> 56:20.885
Someone has to check on them.

56:21.208 --> 56:23.802
<i>Party at the Fantasia tonight!</i>

56:23.958 --> 56:27.588
They're going out drinking again.
They're supposed to study!

56:28.542 --> 56:30.920
Time for a little lesson.
- The Fantasia, huh?

56:31.250 --> 56:34.800
Last time I was there I was 16. Can I come?
- No!

56:35.125 --> 56:37.378
Please! I could use some cool music.

56:38.500 --> 56:40.969
I don't want to be seen with you.
- I don't believe you.

56:41.125 --> 56:44.629
Even teachers like to party,
even teachers have time off,

56:44.792 --> 56:46.635
even you can come along.

56:47.792 --> 56:48.884
Or maybe not.

56:53.250 --> 56:55.344
ID, please.
- Yes, of course.

56:55.667 --> 56:57.465
That was a joke. This is Paco.

56:59.417 --> 57:00.464
ID, huh?

57:00.625 --> 57:02.844
Your retards are here,
the DJ is briefed.

57:03.000 --> 57:06.209
Strippers use the second door, please.
Thanks.

57:10.792 --> 57:12.089
That's Amrei, by the way.

57:13.708 --> 57:17.508
That's her?
I don't see what's wrong with her foot.

57:17.667 --> 57:19.590
You only see it when she walks.

57:21.542 --> 57:23.010
Man, the music sucks!

57:23.333 --> 57:26.052
You're the one who wanted to go out
once more before it's over.

57:26.375 --> 57:30.505
Why are you such a buzz kill?
- Did you think anyone would talk to you?

57:33.875 --> 57:34.876
Oh, Amrei!

57:37.167 --> 57:39.090
Now look.

57:40.625 --> 57:42.002
Oh, okay.

57:53.917 --> 57:56.090
Yeah.
Can I still screw when I'm on it?

57:56.250 --> 57:58.844
For sure. Like a rabbit.

58:02.917 --> 58:04.294
There.
- Oh.

58:09.708 --> 58:11.255
Let him in, he's with me.

58:11.583 --> 58:12.755
Go ahead, kid.

58:13.917 --> 58:16.761
Where are the drinks?
- Burak, how much did you drink?

58:17.208 --> 58:19.802
He grinded up on me from behind again.

58:43.417 --> 58:45.920
Are you an alcoholic or what?
Gimme that!

58:47.417 --> 58:51.217
Hey party people! What's up?
I thought you're studying?

58:51.375 --> 58:55.255
OMG, go away. You're the oldest
person here. That's so embarrassing!

59:23.667 --> 59:25.965
I don't feel anything.
Shit!

59:27.500 --> 59:29.844
Stop embarrassing us!

59:31.083 --> 59:32.926
Short time-out!

59:37.875 --> 59:42.927
Chantal, Daniel,
Burak and Zeynep!

59:43.083 --> 59:45.927
Thanks for partying
with your teachers tonight!

59:50.042 --> 59:54.092
You are my absolute favorite students!

01:00:00.125 --> 01:00:02.503
Okay, time to go home
and do your homework!

01:00:10.208 --> 01:00:12.961
Britney!

01:00:31.542 --> 01:00:32.794
Biggi!

01:00:33.125 --> 01:00:35.344
I am Britney!

01:01:32.167 --> 01:01:33.760
Hey, Madonna!

01:01:33.917 --> 01:01:35.715
When is your new record out?

01:01:36.042 --> 01:01:39.842
Tomorrow is school.
What was in that drink?

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.752
Why are you shouting?
- The music!

01:01:42.083 --> 01:01:44.711
There is no more music, you're tripping!

01:01:44.875 --> 01:01:48.550
It's not <i>your</i> music!
- Hey, I'm Britney!

01:01:48.875 --> 01:01:50.969
Get in!
- I don't want to.

01:01:51.292 --> 01:01:53.670
Danger, Laura, get in the car!

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.549
Worst evening ever.

01:01:59.708 --> 01:02:01.927
Hey, where do I live?

01:02:08.708 --> 01:02:10.881
It's so dangerous
as an attractive young woman,

01:02:11.208 --> 01:02:13.586
people are always putting something
in your drink.

01:02:15.917 --> 01:02:19.626
<i>Miller and Enzberger,
to the Principal's office, ASAP-issimo.</i>

01:02:19.958 --> 01:02:22.552
It's like with George Orwell.
- You get used to it.

01:02:31.292 --> 01:02:34.136
This is trending.
And no matter how often I watch it,

01:02:34.292 --> 01:02:37.091
I can't seem to find
the pedagogical value in it.

01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:39.753
I think someone was...
- Pardon?

01:02:40.083 --> 01:02:42.506
Impersonating me.
- Were you on drugs?

01:02:42.833 --> 01:02:46.383
And why would you do such a thing?
- Now the whole surprise is ruined,

01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:50.129
It's part of the anti-bullying seminar.

01:02:50.292 --> 01:02:54.172
Ms. Enzberger needed a hashtag
for the seminar, and this is part of it.

01:02:54.333 --> 01:02:59.464
To make the students aware of how fast
such embarrassing videos can spread online.

01:03:00.208 --> 01:03:03.257
And then reconsider their behavior?

01:03:07.833 --> 01:03:10.461
I'm holding the seminar?
We have to report the theft.

01:03:10.792 --> 01:03:14.751
If you get the cops involved, she'll be
kicked out of school and that's it.

01:03:15.083 --> 01:03:18.417
What is the hashtag?
-"Stop shaming".

01:03:18.750 --> 01:03:21.549
"Stop WebShaming", I think it was.
- Yeah, right.

01:03:21.875 --> 01:03:25.880
You have a budget for the seminar.
Weren't you going to get an expert?

01:03:26.208 --> 01:03:28.006
What a little busy bee.

01:03:28.792 --> 01:03:31.215
Wants to do everything herself.

01:03:31.542 --> 01:03:33.294
All right, fine.

01:03:44.083 --> 01:03:47.838
Zeynep! Amrei is meeting someone.
Yeah, I'm on it.

01:03:49.417 --> 01:03:51.920
The emos are chilling at the cemetery.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.968
You don't understand a thing!

01:04:07.292 --> 01:04:10.717
I'm meeting someone!
- You come back! I want you to fight!

01:04:11.042 --> 01:04:13.545
And I'm taking away your computer
for good!

01:04:39.167 --> 01:04:41.261
Are you lsabell?

01:04:41.708 --> 01:04:43.676
Yeah.
- Wow...

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.050
It's so strange meeting for the first time
in person, after all the chatting.

01:04:48.833 --> 01:04:50.801
Yeah, so what's up?

01:04:52.958 --> 01:04:55.461
I mean, I'm in such a shitty mood again.

01:04:55.792 --> 01:05:00.343
I have the mobile home. My grandpa
didn't notice that I stole the keys.

01:05:00.667 --> 01:05:02.761
I have everything for the party, too.

01:05:04.125 --> 01:05:07.675
You don't look so sick.
- You're saying that to a cancer patient?

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.502
Oh, Amrei!

01:05:10.250 --> 01:05:13.094
Oh, god, I'm sorry.
I know it doesn't always show.

01:05:13.417 --> 01:05:15.465
That's okay.
I'm wearing heavy make-up.

01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:19.877
Ow.

01:05:20.208 --> 01:05:23.792
Tell me if my nose starts to bleed.
That happens sometimes.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.970
I really liked your poem about Hades.

01:05:29.125 --> 01:05:31.298
That we'll all go to Hades
and be free at last.

01:05:32.583 --> 01:05:34.927
Yeah, thanks. So sweet of you.

01:05:38.125 --> 01:05:41.425
I have everything you need
to hide out until it's time.

01:05:41.583 --> 01:05:43.506
No more online contact. It's safer.

01:06:01.583 --> 01:06:04.177
That's such a beautiful gravestone.

01:06:04.333 --> 01:06:06.176
I'd like one just like it.

01:06:08.958 --> 01:06:10.380
SO,

01:06:10.708 --> 01:06:13.632
they want to run away,
to a town... I forgot the name.

01:06:13.958 --> 01:06:17.087
They want to be free.
I think they have problems at home.

01:06:17.250 --> 01:06:20.424
Chantal, you have to stop them.
- Relax, I'm on it.

01:06:20.583 --> 01:06:24.008
I want to find out a little more.
Maybe I can interview them.

01:06:24.333 --> 01:06:27.587
"Runaways in Private".
Do you think that could be a good article?

01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:31.334
<i>When will you give her my letter?</i>
- OMG, <i>it's</i> always <i>about you!</i>

01:06:36.625 --> 01:06:38.753
Piss off!
Hey, piss off!

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.968
Is this the Paralympics or what?

01:06:42.292 --> 01:06:43.669
Get her, Mats!

01:06:46.250 --> 01:06:48.378
You jerk!

01:06:53.542 --> 01:06:55.010
Who was that?

01:06:57.167 --> 01:06:59.590
Good morning! Okay.
- Morning.

01:07:00.333 --> 01:07:03.633
Sure, there are anti-bullying experts
for 250 euros.

01:07:03.958 --> 01:07:06.882
But we teachers
keep getting new challenges.

01:07:07.042 --> 01:07:09.591
Bullying, some of you might think,

01:07:10.625 --> 01:07:13.834
is something we can deal with
in the schoolyard.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.301
No, we can't.
We'll deal with it here today, together.

01:07:18.625 --> 01:07:20.172
Remember the annual sports event,

01:07:20.333 --> 01:07:23.883
when Ariane ran the 200-meter race
like crazy?

01:07:24.208 --> 01:07:26.461
She left everyone in the dust,
right Ariane?

01:07:26.792 --> 01:07:29.762
Yup.
- But she stopped, just before the finish.

01:07:30.458 --> 01:07:34.543
I shouted, "Ariane, keep running!
You're winning!"

01:07:35.042 --> 01:07:37.044
And what did you say?
-"No, no, no."

01:07:37.208 --> 01:07:40.712
Ariane waited.
She wanted everyone to finish together.

01:07:40.875 --> 01:07:45.130
She took her best friend's hand and
finished with her. Then what did you say?

01:07:45.917 --> 01:07:49.342
"We'll do it together."
- We'll do it... together.

01:07:50.208 --> 01:07:53.052
We will do it together!

01:07:53.375 --> 01:07:57.334
That's the line I want you to remember
after this seminar is over.

01:07:57.500 --> 01:08:02.051
Okay, who wants to share
what it feels like when people bully you?

01:08:03.125 --> 01:08:05.503
So everyone knows what it means.

01:08:07.208 --> 01:08:08.835
Who has the courage?

01:08:12.167 --> 01:08:13.760
Take your time.

01:08:15.083 --> 01:08:17.301
Oh, man!
- My eyes are burning!

01:08:17.625 --> 01:08:20.127
Maybe not that much time.
- Me.

01:08:20.917 --> 01:08:22.510
Okay, wow.
Come on up.

01:08:23.707 --> 01:08:24.925
Mr. Miller!

01:08:25.250 --> 01:08:28.584
Tell us who mistreated you
in the teachers' room.

01:08:30.832 --> 01:08:34.042
Well, there's this kid who...

01:08:34.375 --> 01:08:37.049
He annoys me.
- Danger.

01:08:37.375 --> 01:08:40.549
I didn't like him,
because he's weak and he's afraid.

01:08:40.707 --> 01:08:42.551
Horrible traits.

01:08:43.292 --> 01:08:45.465
The kid I'm talking about is...

01:08:47.875 --> 01:08:50.002
No, I won't tell you.

01:08:50.332 --> 01:08:52.961
He lived in an orphanage
after his mother died.

01:08:53.292 --> 01:08:55.841
He's too skinny, looks like a gypsy,
and he stinks.

01:08:56.167 --> 01:08:59.171
Danger!
- Now we know who it is.

01:08:59.332 --> 01:09:02.917
He doesn't shower because the older kids
stuff soap in his mouth,

01:09:03.082 --> 01:09:06.166
and hold the showerhead in his face
until he can't breathe.

01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:10.130
At school no one wants to sit next to him
because he's dirty.

01:09:11.207 --> 01:09:16.510
He doesn't wash his T-shirt because it
has a sweat stain that looks like Tupac.

01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:22.255
Everyone calls him gypsy.
No one asks how he's doing.

01:09:23.625 --> 01:09:26.549
Then he starts smoking.
But not cigarettes, crack.

01:09:26.707 --> 01:09:28.836
He thinks it makes him cooler.

01:09:29.167 --> 01:09:33.752
He just wants to be part of the game, or
have a teacher ask if everything's okay.

01:09:34.082 --> 01:09:36.926
But no one asks,
and no one notices anything.

01:09:37.250 --> 01:09:41.460
Not even when he starts skipping school.
He could vanish and nobody would notice.

01:09:41.792 --> 01:09:46.127
And why don't you like the boy?
- I said I didn't like him.

01:09:46.457 --> 01:09:49.712
Because I don't like to be
reminded of him.

01:09:50.042 --> 01:09:54.171
But I think they would've thought twice
if they'd heard his story or why he stinks.

01:09:54.917 --> 01:09:57.921
Because he's afraid
to use the showers.

01:09:58.083 --> 01:10:02.168
Or that they tattooed a penis
on his shoulder with a knitting needle,

01:10:02.375 --> 01:10:04.594
which is why he won't take part in sports.

01:10:04.917 --> 01:10:08.751
I didn't like him because
he never learned how to ask for help.

01:10:10.125 --> 01:10:12.048
He could've found his way more easily,

01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:14.427
and become something other than...

01:10:14.583 --> 01:10:16.426
a teacher.

01:10:16.750 --> 01:10:20.254
Who's he talking about?
- Why do you think I have this lame tribal?

01:10:21.708 --> 01:10:24.917
But I'll pay for anyone's tattoo
who has a penis on their shoulder.

01:10:25.083 --> 01:10:27.085
Okay, I broke the ice.

01:10:29.208 --> 01:10:30.926
Thank you, Mr. Miller.

01:10:32.208 --> 01:10:34.051
Who else dares to speak up?

01:10:35.125 --> 01:10:37.219
Come on. Go ahead.

01:10:37.375 --> 01:10:39.298
Be brave.

01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:41.627
Justin. Come on up.

01:11:25.417 --> 01:11:27.260
My mom wanted to call the police,

01:11:27.583 --> 01:11:32.168
but I said I'd handle it on my own,
because I'm not a baby anymore.

01:11:33.708 --> 01:11:37.838
And I told you to take it off Facebook.

01:11:38.542 --> 01:11:41.625
And you said you would...
if I jump off the roof

01:11:42.667 --> 01:11:44.089
shouting "I can fly."

01:11:47.042 --> 01:11:49.136
And my bone was sticking out,

01:11:49.292 --> 01:11:51.169
and I didn't even cry.

01:11:51.375 --> 01:11:54.128
I thought someone
might visit me at the hospital,

01:11:54.292 --> 01:11:56.511
but not even my best friend came.

01:11:56.833 --> 01:12:00.212
Because they told him
that if he visited me...

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:18.050
Like in the movies, where the outsiders
are always cool in the end.

01:12:18.375 --> 01:12:21.504
Show them why you wear the mask.
Go on.

01:12:42.583 --> 01:12:45.006
Let's all get undressed! For Justin!

01:12:45.542 --> 01:12:48.625
Yeah, we'll all take a photo together.
In underwear, too!

01:12:48.792 --> 01:12:52.046
Yeah! Come on, everybody!
- Let's do it!

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.844
Please remember to use the hashtag
"StopWebShaming,"

01:13:04.167 --> 01:13:07.296
for which Chantal and I
already made a little video.

01:13:34.750 --> 01:13:37.674
Please accept my penis!

01:13:37.833 --> 01:13:39.551
Go away, dude!

01:13:39.708 --> 01:13:41.426
Oh, god!

01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:45.175
Okay kids, everyone can get dressed again.
That's enough, thanks.

01:13:48.917 --> 01:13:50.214
Thanks.

01:13:51.292 --> 01:13:53.294
Hello! I have something to say, too.

01:13:53.875 --> 01:13:57.709
So far. it's been all about the ugly kids,
and the retar... Okay, never mind.

01:13:58.208 --> 01:14:01.587
I wanted to say
that it's a little like bullying

01:14:23.875 --> 01:14:26.173
Chanti, you badass!
- Yeah, Chanti!

01:14:32.583 --> 01:14:33.630
Well,

01:14:33.958 --> 01:14:37.462
I'll admit it's sometimes hard to believe
that people can rise to the occasion.

01:14:37.792 --> 01:14:42.172
But if you or anyone else here writes
a very good article for the school paper,

01:14:42.417 --> 01:14:47.628
that would really help our school. So yes,
I do hope, and I believe in you, Chantal.

01:14:49.375 --> 01:14:51.503
Thank you, Ms. Gerster.

01:14:52.125 --> 01:14:54.093
Goodness, please.
- Just a sec.

01:14:54.417 --> 01:14:57.466
Okay, and now let's take a photo
for #StopWebShaming.

01:14:59.625 --> 01:15:01.343
Smile...

01:15:02.625 --> 01:15:05.003
Ooops!
- Honestly, Chantal!

01:15:06.417 --> 01:15:09.045
Ms. Enzberger, this is a bit too cozy.
It's awkward.

01:15:09.750 --> 01:15:12.674
Okay, kids, that was it.
Back to class.

01:15:12.833 --> 01:15:16.042
I learned a lot, I hope you did too.
Bye.

01:15:22.333 --> 01:15:25.086
Interview, Class Fart,
Leimbach-Knorr tells all.

01:15:27.417 --> 01:15:31.126
Without Spanx, would you wear
two sizes larger, yes or no?

01:15:31.458 --> 01:15:34.758
Would you rather date
a 16- or an 18-year-old?

01:15:34.917 --> 01:15:36.385
Did you know Hitler personally?

01:15:36.708 --> 01:15:38.881
Excuse me?
- If so, what was he like?

01:15:39.208 --> 01:15:41.302
You're nuts.
- How often do you have sex?

01:15:41.458 --> 01:15:45.213
You think these yellow press questions
will win the Class Fart an award?

01:15:46.875 --> 01:15:48.673
What is this?

01:15:50.292 --> 01:15:53.842
You will not print this.
- The editorial board already approved it.

01:15:54.167 --> 01:15:56.340
There's no one on the board besides you.

01:15:56.667 --> 01:16:00.592
Ingrid, since I've been in charge,
the Class Fart is super-successful!

01:16:00.750 --> 01:16:02.297
We're not on a first-name basis.

01:16:02.458 --> 01:16:05.428
Leave now and you'll get nominated
for "worst teacher outfit".

01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:55.049
Look what I found in the boiler room!

01:16:55.375 --> 01:16:57.002
You're lying!
"No!

01:16:57.333 --> 01:17:01.042
And those essays weren't ours either!
He just made it all up to look good!

01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:03.923
I'm a crappy journalist!

01:17:04.833 --> 01:17:06.927
And you're all failures too.

01:17:07.250 --> 01:17:09.093
We'll never amount to anything. Never.

01:17:09.417 --> 01:17:12.671
But I can sing. That part was true.
- No, you can't!

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.594
Why would he do that?
- He wants us to be motivated.

01:17:15.917 --> 01:17:18.670
So we think we're real people
and pass the performance test.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.468
So we'll study and stuff.

01:17:20.792 --> 01:17:23.215
But we'll never be normal people!

01:17:23.375 --> 01:17:25.503
We're damned to be
what came out at the JIC!

01:17:25.833 --> 01:17:28.131
Geriatric nurse!

01:17:31.667 --> 01:17:34.090
I'm having a negative orgasm.

01:17:34.250 --> 01:17:37.220
Archeetect always felt weird to me.

01:18:13.208 --> 01:18:15.256
I hit the wrong note there.

01:18:19.708 --> 01:18:22.882
That wasn't professional to you?
- Calm down, bro.

01:18:27.458 --> 01:18:29.176
We shouldn't have trusted him.

01:18:42.375 --> 01:18:44.673
Those weren't our childhood essays!

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.049
You fucked with us!
We're failures!

01:18:48.375 --> 01:18:49.843
Fuck school!

01:19:03.417 --> 01:19:05.761
You said
you'd let me out in front of school.

01:19:07.333 --> 01:19:09.756
This is so embarrassing!

01:19:20.917 --> 01:19:23.386
Why are the Smurfs on your iPod?

01:19:23.708 --> 01:19:26.461
Turn it off! It's my sister's!

01:19:26.792 --> 01:19:28.214
Stupid kid!

01:19:31.458 --> 01:19:32.550
Here.

01:19:33.208 --> 01:19:34.505
Daniel, don't overdo it!

01:19:34.833 --> 01:19:36.585
Or what? Huh?

01:19:41.875 --> 01:19:45.459
I thought you could use a little
motivation. Now don't freak out!

01:19:45.625 --> 01:19:50.085
You were the only teacher who told us
the truth, but you're like all the rest!

01:19:50.250 --> 01:19:54.585
We want the answers to the exam, or else
we'll tell the police everything about you!

01:19:54.750 --> 01:19:56.093
Hey!

01:19:58.542 --> 01:20:00.135
What... what was that?

01:20:00.958 --> 01:20:02.676
Theater Club!

01:20:06.333 --> 01:20:07.676
Shit.

01:20:12.708 --> 01:20:14.961
Have a good lunch!
- You too!

01:20:21.708 --> 01:20:23.881
FEDERAL MINISTRY
OF EDUCATION

01:21:11.667 --> 01:21:13.635
<i>Eckhart, this is Erika
from Schiller School.</i>

01:21:13.792 --> 01:21:16.341
<i>The test better be hard.
No more gifts to Gudrun.</i>

01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:18.047
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

01:21:18.208 --> 01:21:22.293
<i>And please set the graduation assignments.
Other states already have theirs.</i>

01:21:22.625 --> 01:21:24.343
Oh, shut up.

01:21:25.625 --> 01:21:27.719
PERFORMANCE TEST - GERMAN

01:21:49.542 --> 01:21:52.921
And then, all of a sudden,
my copy card was blocked.

01:21:53.250 --> 01:21:55.298
So I call the technician,

01:21:55.625 --> 01:21:57.627
but of course no one comes!
- Really?

01:21:57.958 --> 01:22:01.041
So I took apart the whole machine,
piece by piece.

01:22:01.375 --> 01:22:03.173
We're looking for Mr. Miller.

01:22:03.333 --> 01:22:06.177
His Art Club applied for
a scholarship.

01:22:06.708 --> 01:22:07.834
That's me.

01:22:08.583 --> 01:22:09.709
Oh.

01:22:10.042 --> 01:22:13.717
We'll have a look at the pieces.
Where's the exhibit?

01:22:13.875 --> 01:22:16.298
Upstairs, but...
- Oh, upstairs!

01:22:19.250 --> 01:22:20.843
But I'm not sure if...

01:22:25.167 --> 01:22:27.761
Niki di Saint Fail!

01:22:35.667 --> 01:22:38.716
What do you think?
- You watched 'Ghost' too often.

01:22:58.167 --> 01:23:00.636
"What's He On About." That's funny.

01:23:00.917 --> 01:23:03.466
We'd like to add it to the catalogue.
- Why?

01:23:03.625 --> 01:23:08.335
We want to give you a scholarship.
And you'll get a museum subscription.

01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:12.130
Maybe you can study art after graduation.
- But I'm not good at school.

01:23:12.458 --> 01:23:14.586
Doesn't matter,
as long as you graduate.

01:23:14.917 --> 01:23:17.545
What you've done here is special. Angry.

01:23:18.292 --> 01:23:19.885
And sad.

01:23:20.042 --> 01:23:24.001
In schools we mostly see conformist crap.
This packs a punch.

01:23:24.625 --> 01:23:26.377
Dope.

01:23:45.583 --> 01:23:49.463
"We're failures. You lied to us.
Blah-blah-blah." Look at Danger.

01:23:50.083 --> 01:23:52.302
What he can do
you can do too.

01:23:54.167 --> 01:23:57.467
But see if I care. Here,
the answers for the performance test.

01:23:57.792 --> 01:24:01.001
Copy it, memorize it,
begin your lives with a lie.

01:24:02.583 --> 01:24:05.006
I know what I'm talking about.

01:24:06.167 --> 01:24:09.467
You can get away with it until your 20s,
then it's all downhill.

01:24:29.792 --> 01:24:33.001
then kick it in, Chantal!

01:24:38.458 --> 01:24:39.675
Your decision.

01:24:45.250 --> 01:24:47.673
The answers!
- Wait!

01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:50.127
Why?

01:25:00.417 --> 01:25:02.044
Mr. Miller!

01:25:02.375 --> 01:25:03.922
I know I'm good!

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:29.968
What?
- We want to know how to study.

01:25:31.625 --> 01:25:33.377
In return, we'll help you in sports class.

01:25:35.208 --> 01:25:38.883
For each class, there's a book
with reference material in the back.

01:25:39.042 --> 01:25:40.919
For every book there's another book?

01:25:42.042 --> 01:25:45.125
Yes, Chantal.
- And how do you find them?

01:26:41.042 --> 01:26:43.386
So many letters!

01:26:44.083 --> 01:26:45.585
And words!

01:27:35.083 --> 01:27:36.710
I'm excited, guys.
- With adverb?

01:27:36.875 --> 01:27:39.048
Deeply excited.
- We're so good.

01:27:40.417 --> 01:27:44.251
Good luck. Jammer is active.
No more googling. We start now!

01:27:46.875 --> 01:27:48.752
11TH GRADE PERFORMANCE TEST

01:28:22.958 --> 01:28:25.507
We can stay at school
and try for A-levels.

01:28:25.833 --> 01:28:26.834
That's right.

01:28:27.167 --> 01:28:30.216
And I'm working on the best article.
- Very good.

01:28:30.542 --> 01:28:31.964
We all passed!

01:28:32.292 --> 01:28:34.135
Mr. Miller had known it.

01:28:34.458 --> 01:28:37.382
Always this past-Heidi-Klum-perfect.
- Huh?

01:29:18.583 --> 01:29:20.677
So cute, with all the candles!

01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:24.843
Uh... okay.

01:29:38.208 --> 01:29:41.758
I'm so glad we're taking this journey.
- Yeah, there's something I need to say.

01:29:42.083 --> 01:29:44.802
To freedom.
- Girls, you sure drink a lot, but okay.

01:29:45.125 --> 01:29:49.005
Cheers to beers
and legs behind your ears.

01:29:51.542 --> 01:29:53.260
Yuck, what is this?

01:29:53.583 --> 01:29:55.756
Emo Colada, or what?

01:30:01.667 --> 01:30:03.010
Okay, no homo!

01:30:05.417 --> 01:30:07.294
Hades, here we come. Together.

01:30:07.625 --> 01:30:09.798
Yeah, what I wanted to say is,

01:30:10.125 --> 01:30:12.594
I can't go to Hades with you, because

01:30:12.833 --> 01:30:16.838
I studied so hard for this one test,
and, yeah, I passed!

01:30:17.125 --> 01:30:19.924
Besides. I have something for you
from Ploppi.

01:30:20.750 --> 01:30:22.593
Who's that?
- Etienne.

01:30:25.167 --> 01:30:26.339
My companion.

01:30:30.083 --> 01:30:32.506
How do you know him?
- So. I suggest

01:30:32.833 --> 01:30:35.256
that we talk a bit about your problems,

01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:40.051
along the lines of "smart people can be
bummed too", then we'll take some photos.

01:30:42.583 --> 01:30:44.256
That heater sure stinks, huh?

01:30:45.333 --> 01:30:48.792
Anyway, maybe we could take a picture
for my article too,

01:30:48.958 --> 01:30:51.802
showing you meeting Ploppi,
where it looks like

01:30:52.125 --> 01:30:55.550
he's stopping you just before
you run away from home. Yeah?

01:30:55.708 --> 01:30:57.585
So, question...

01:30:57.750 --> 01:31:00.720
Hey, this is really kicking in.
Isabell?

01:31:01.458 --> 01:31:04.177
We just drank a toast.
We're going to die.

01:31:06.208 --> 01:31:08.711
I thought this is
a booze cruise to Hades?

01:31:08.875 --> 01:31:11.253
Hades is the Greek underworld.
What did you think?

01:31:11.583 --> 01:31:14.757
Uh, I thought it's a party location
in Bulgaria.

01:31:16.208 --> 01:31:17.926
You're having delusions.

01:31:23.500 --> 01:31:25.844
OMG, you want to kill yourselves!

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.628
Honey, we agreed on all this in the forum.

01:31:28.792 --> 01:31:32.046
Remember, lsabell? You have cancer.
- But he loves you!

01:31:34.250 --> 01:31:35.718
No one loves us.

01:31:38.542 --> 01:31:41.045
And once we're asleep, it'll all go fast.

01:31:41.875 --> 01:31:44.719
No, but I don't want to die.
I don't have cancer!

01:32:11.792 --> 01:32:13.385
This is nice.

01:32:15.125 --> 01:32:17.594
What was in that drink?

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.001
No...

01:32:27.417 --> 01:32:29.590
Siri...

01:32:29.917 --> 01:32:31.169
Ploppi.

01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:32.843
<i>Ploppi, Etienne.</i>

01:32:37.042 --> 01:32:40.091
Any new developments?
- I don't want to...

01:32:40.750 --> 01:32:42.127
die.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:53.300
Are you gonna do that the whole drive?
- I'm afraid so.

01:32:54.042 --> 01:32:56.295
I have to imitate the engine.

01:33:02.417 --> 01:33:03.885
It has to be here somewhere.

01:33:08.583 --> 01:33:11.382
Where?
- Take the next right.

01:33:13.958 --> 01:33:17.007
When 50% of hemoglobin molecules
bind with carbon monoxide,

01:33:17.167 --> 01:33:18.669
you lose consciousness.

01:33:33.958 --> 01:33:35.255
Turn them over.

01:33:35.583 --> 01:33:36.675
Get them out.

01:33:39.583 --> 01:33:40.960
The next one.

01:33:46.167 --> 01:33:48.135
They're only unconscious.

01:33:52.875 --> 01:33:55.094
Who are you screwing?

01:33:55.875 --> 01:33:57.843
Well, I can't... won't answer that.

01:34:03.542 --> 01:34:06.261
I wish I could be unconscious too.

01:34:15.167 --> 01:34:18.171
I'm here. Everything will be fine.

01:35:17.875 --> 01:35:20.219
When are your parents finally coming?

01:35:22.417 --> 01:35:23.885
Just so it's clear:

01:35:24.208 --> 01:35:26.051
This was not for nothing.

01:35:26.208 --> 01:35:28.836
You owe me one,
you suicide bitches.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.423
I wanted to hook you up,
not kick the bucket.

01:35:31.583 --> 01:35:34.427
Oh god, who dressed me in this?

01:35:53.792 --> 01:35:57.001
<i>The group of suicidal kids
was saved by a teacher</i>

01:35:57.208 --> 01:36:01.167
<i>who apparently had his students chipped
as a last resort against truancy.</i>

01:36:01.333 --> 01:36:04.667
<i>How do you feel?
- A salary bonus would be nice.</i>

01:36:05.458 --> 01:36:08.428
<i>Do you enjoy being a teacher?
- No, but I try to hide it.</i>

01:36:09.792 --> 01:36:12.341
<i>He chipped us so he can find us
whenever we fuck up.</i>

01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:14.628
<i>He's just the best.
- Yeah.</i>

01:36:14.792 --> 01:36:17.466
<i>Worm treatment's next,
then she's ready for life.</i>

01:36:17.792 --> 01:36:19.920
<i>What happened
in that camper, Amrei?</i>

01:36:20.167 --> 01:36:22.886
<i>I can't say, I have
an exclusive interview with...</i>

01:36:23.042 --> 01:36:26.296
<i>With the "Class Fart".
I'm the editor, I rescued her.</i>

01:36:26.625 --> 01:36:28.298
<i>Chantal?
- Yes, that's right.</i>

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:35.130
What a hero. Don't we all wish we had
a teacher like that. That's it from me,

01:36:52.292 --> 01:36:54.545
You mean by Mr. Miller, the "problem"?

01:36:54.875 --> 01:36:57.958
The man's a genius.
Since when do pupils cheer their teacher?

01:36:58.125 --> 01:37:00.173
Normally they gun us down!

01:37:00.333 --> 01:37:04.634
You got more registrations in four hours
than the SCG got all last year.

01:37:04.792 --> 01:37:08.001
I thought comprehensive schools
were a lost cause?

01:37:08.167 --> 01:37:11.216
Yes. Yes, I made a mistake.
GCS has to stay,

01:37:30.500 --> 01:37:33.674
Do you realize
how this will help your budget? Gudrun?

01:37:34.208 --> 01:37:37.382
No idea.
What about the Bunsen burners?

01:37:41.708 --> 01:37:45.463
Oh my god, I didn't know
that "Spiegel TV" had a magazine too.

01:38:08.667 --> 01:38:10.260
Don't mind me.

01:38:12.458 --> 01:38:14.631
Good morning.
- Morning!

01:38:15.625 --> 01:38:17.002
Ploppi, clean the blackboard.

01:38:19.250 --> 01:38:22.800
Mr. Miller, put away the beer,
it's time for your teaching demonstration.

01:38:24.375 --> 01:38:26.343
Are you prepared?
- Of course.

01:38:27.375 --> 01:38:29.798
What's the topic?
- What do you think?

01:38:32.833 --> 01:38:35.256
Sit down.
It would be cool if we could...

01:38:58.292 --> 01:39:02.172
Tadpoles and a machine!
- He doesn't like tadpoles!

01:39:02.333 --> 01:39:04.006
OMG, only four more minutes!

01:39:04.167 --> 01:39:07.467
Let's read the book. Everyone one page!
Mark whatever sounds smart.

01:39:07.625 --> 01:39:10.094
No, I don't want to read it.
It's about gays.

01:39:10.250 --> 01:39:12.594
"Homo Faber" is a wordplay
on homo sapiens.

01:39:12.750 --> 01:39:15.048
We're all homo sapi...
- I'll punch you one!

01:39:15.208 --> 01:39:18.417
Oh, come off it!
I mean, who was it who blew Burak?

01:39:28.250 --> 01:39:31.550
Mr. Gehlen, Ms. Sturz-Grube,
Ms. Bergmann and I

01:39:31.875 --> 01:39:34.094
wish you good luck.

01:39:43.125 --> 01:39:44.672
Here we have a picture.

01:39:44.833 --> 01:39:48.417
Who can tell me what it means?
Yes?

01:39:48.750 --> 01:39:52.630
I think it has to do with Homo Faber's
problem with nature.

01:40:08.917 --> 01:40:10.669
Because...
- He falls in love.

01:40:10.833 --> 01:40:12.756
Because he falls in love. With Elisabeth.

01:40:14.583 --> 01:40:16.802
With Elisabeth, yes.

01:40:17.125 --> 01:40:19.469
Don't we all have an Elisabeth...

01:40:19.958 --> 01:40:21.631
for whom we change?

01:40:29.083 --> 01:40:33.042
How do the changes in Faber's character
become evident?

01:40:34.083 --> 01:40:36.927
He gets interested in other things
all of a sudden.

01:40:37.083 --> 01:40:39.962
He gets... nicer.

01:40:40.750 --> 01:40:44.300
Yeah, and he's no longer so...
unemotional.

01:40:44.542 --> 01:40:47.341
Instead, he shows more human traits.

01:40:47.833 --> 01:40:51.667
He's more likable. You want him
to be happy, to find his place in life.

01:40:54.667 --> 01:40:56.544
Text passages?

01:40:58.167 --> 01:40:59.919
Yeah, the foreigner.

01:41:03.792 --> 01:41:05.339
All the best.
- Mr. Miller!

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.503
I'm proud of you.
You saved the school.

01:41:08.667 --> 01:41:12.001
You brought out the best in your students,
and in yourself.

01:41:12.167 --> 01:41:16.673
It pays off to believe in every
problem student, until the very end.

01:41:18.375 --> 01:41:20.719
You did good, assholes.

01:41:33.833 --> 01:41:35.506
Yeah, you've reached adulthood.

01:41:36.167 --> 01:41:37.714
Not at all.

01:41:42.417 --> 01:41:43.919
ONE YEAR LATER

01:41:44.083 --> 01:41:46.336
Freedom is the word
teachers hear most often.

01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:49.424
The freedom to live
a self-determined life,

01:41:49.583 --> 01:41:51.335
without interference.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.048
<i>No, it's still there.</i>

01:42:15.417 --> 01:42:18.751
<i>Funny, why is everyone looking at me?
ls there something on my face?</i>

01:42:20.958 --> 01:42:24.167
<i>Hello?
Does anyone here happen to be single?</i>

01:42:25.500 --> 01:42:26.752
<i>Okay, I'll stop now</i>

01:42:26.917 --> 01:42:30.467
<i>and finally give those buttheads
their report cards.</i>

01:42:54.958 --> 01:42:55.925
Nerd.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:01.217
<i>A-</i>

01:43:03.542 --> 01:43:05.294

01:43:12.125 --> 01:43:14.219
<i>c-</i>

01:44:06.875 --> 01:44:09.628
He saw more in us than many others did.

01:44:10.458 --> 01:44:14.213
And he always wanted us
to win in the end.

01:44:15.292 --> 01:44:19.593
Mr. Miller, we'll always think of you
later in life, when we're unemployed.

01:44:22.625 --> 01:44:24.377
<i>Yeah, Chant“.!</i>

01:44:25.083 --> 01:44:28.257
Thanks. And in case you filmed this,
link me on lnstagram.

01:44:47.792 --> 01:44:49.590
Nope.

01:45:51.958 --> 01:45:55.132
<i>Guess who got an internship
at a regional paper?</i>

01:45:56.500 --> 01:45:57.797
<i>Me.</i>

<i>My article about a sodomist rabbit breeder</i>

01:46:11.208 --> 01:46:13.006
<i>won the newcomer award...</i>

01:46:16.167 --> 01:46:19.546
<i>and got me a traineeship
with a kick-ass magazine.</i>

01:46:47.417 --> 01:46:51.092
Can someone hit me?
I have to get angry.

01:46:51.417 --> 01:46:53.090
Like Hulk.

01:46:57.500 --> 01:46:58.547
Nope.

01:46:58.708 --> 01:47:01.791
<i>Laura decided to do
a social year in Africa,</i>

<i>and fell in love
with a student from Hanover.</i>

01:47:08.042 --> 01:47:09.419
Normally I can do better.

01:47:09.750 --> 01:47:12.424
Mr. Becker, you can go now.

<i>She was fair enough
to inform Danger via text message.</i>

01:47:16.625 --> 01:47:18.377

IF WE SPLIT UP.

01:47:20.208 --> 01:47:22.302
That bitch!

01:47:27.750 --> 01:47:29.969
I told her a thousand times

01:47:30.292 --> 01:47:32.135
not to go to Africa!

01:47:32.458 --> 01:47:34.802
What am I supposed to do now?

01:47:35.125 --> 01:47:38.254
It's so hard
to find a good girlfriend,

01:47:38.417 --> 01:47:40.795
who accepts you the way you are!

01:47:50.250 --> 01:47:53.003
I hate her!

01:47:53.333 --> 01:47:56.337
I hate you, Laura Schnabelstedt!

01:48:48.625 --> 01:48:49.751
Done.

01:48:55.542 --> 01:48:56.714
What happened, Yo?

01:48:57.875 --> 01:48:59.252

I'm on your side,
which saved your school head...

01:53:10.583 --> 01:53:12.085
I mean head.

01:53:12.542 --> 01:53:15.671
I need to report something positive.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:18.718
What happens to me...

01:53:19.792 --> 01:53:22.511
if we close?

01:53:53.500 --> 01:53:56.344
That's right.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:53:59.252
Pass the coffee.

01:54:02.708 --> 01:54:04.255
Hey! Pass the coffee,

01:54:04.542 --> 01:54:08.672
Martina.
- Meike. We were on a class trip together.

01:54:09.375 --> 01:54:12.834
Experts in suicide, or what...
- Yup.

01:54:13.167 --> 01:54:16.296
Experts developed highly
complex algorithms for this...

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.002
I don't know.

01:54:19.333 --> 01:54:21.802
You call this motivational?
Can you reprogram...

01:54:21.958 --> 01:54:24.381
The look on your face.
- I'm sorry!

01:54:24.708 --> 01:54:27.632
You call this motivational?
Can you reprogram it?

01:54:27.792 --> 01:54:30.591
Experts developed highly

Exper"

01:54:32.500 --> 01:54:34.252
It's really tricky.

01:54:34.583 --> 01:54:38.588
Experts developed highly
complex algorithms for it...

01:54:39.417 --> 01:54:40.760
Shit.

01:54:42.042 --> 01:54:45.467
Experts developed highly

Can you reprogram it?

01:55:19.625 --> 01:55:21.002
Yeah...
- What?

01:55:21.167 --> 01:55:22.419
Could you ask again?
- Of course.

01:55:22.583 --> 01:55:23.835
Thanks.
- Sure.

01:55:26.958 --> 01:55:29.837
Why was there a needle in there?
- Ouch.

01:55:32.583 --> 01:55:34.551
No, I can't!
Too much saliva!

01:55:40.958 --> 01:55:43.336
No, I can't!
Too much saliva!

01:56:14.458 --> 01:56:16.881
You throw it to her.
- Throw it, don't shoot it.

01:56:17.083 --> 01:56:19.006
Just throw it.

<i>Action!</i>

01:56:31.542 --> 01:56:34.512
Stay in! Stay in there!

01:57:26.250 --> 01:57:27.923
<i>Okay, now'.
- Action!</i>

01:57:32.292 --> 01:57:35.296
But I'll pay for anyone's tattoo
who has a penis, too.

01:57:35.792 --> 01:57:38.090
No! No, no.

01:57:38.792 --> 01:57:40.760
It looks like a baby made mine.

01:57:49.208 --> 01:57:51.302

He couldn't make it.

01:58:12.625 --> 01:58:14.844
Bullshit.

01:58:15.917 --> 01:58:18.136
Oh, man!

01:58:27.833 --> 01:58:30.803
Okay, who do we have here? Wait...

01:58:31.125 --> 01:58:32.422
<i>And, action!</i>

01:59:02.958 --> 01:59:05.131
Are they broken off?

01:59:07.125 --> 01:59:08.251
No.

01:59:08.542 --> 01:59:10.761
No.
