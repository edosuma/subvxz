23:46.228 --> 23:48.672
It's beautiful up there.

23:51.635 --> 23:53.771
Where are you from?

23:57.074 --> 24:00.918
- What do you want?
- I want to know where you're from.

24:03.613 --> 24:05.955
I'm from Readfield.

24:06.851 --> 24:11.695
- Readfield. Where's that?
- Please, tell me what you want.

24:12.690 --> 24:17.864
I just want to know where Readfield
is. And I want you to relax.

24:34.213 --> 24:36.087
Cheers.

24:37.550 --> 24:42.286
I'll make a toast. Here's to
good friends and hometowns

24:42.287 --> 24:45.892
and Readfield. Wherever that is.

24:51.196 --> 24:53.298
- Listen...
- Tom.

24:53.299 --> 24:55.105
Tom.

24:56.236 --> 25:01.040
I have someplace to be.
I have obligations.

25:01.041 --> 25:05.316
Yeah. I know. Way too many.

25:05.513 --> 25:10.255
You need time for yourself. You don't
need to be at everyone's beck and call.

25:13.420 --> 25:17.025
Then maybe we should get
a drink in the new year.

25:18.960 --> 25:23.998
I've already prepared
everything. It's all here.

25:23.999 --> 25:26.668
I know, and it looks really good.

25:26.669 --> 25:30.505
Yeah? Great. Well, let's eat.

25:30.506 --> 25:32.006
I'm starving.

25:32.007 --> 25:35.009
Tom, this is really sweet
of you, and I mean that.

25:35.010 --> 25:37.579
But my whole family is
expecting me. I have plans.

25:37.580 --> 25:40.387
I guess some plans are
made to be broken.

25:43.553 --> 25:46.429
Do you want to say
grace or should I?

25:48.991 --> 25:53.869
Hell, let's skip it. I've never
been religious anyway.

25:55.865 --> 25:57.739
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

26:03.874 --> 26:06.078
What do you like to do?

26:08.912 --> 26:12.426
After work and stuff?
I guess, hobbies.

26:12.482 --> 26:15.818
That's a mundane question,
but I guess people ask that

26:15.819 --> 26:18.287
just to get to know
each other, right?

26:18.288 --> 26:23.838
I read. Right now I'm reading
Hemingway, The Sun Also Rises.

26:24.328 --> 26:29.675
And you really should eat.
It's gonna get cold.

26:30.603 --> 26:35.640
Anyway, in the book this guy
loves this girl so much

26:35.641 --> 26:40.451
that he's willing to forgive
everything that she does.

26:40.646 --> 26:43.693
Even her infidelities.

26:44.651 --> 26:47.424
That's a pretty
intense story, but...

26:48.588 --> 26:51.361
That's what love is
supposed to be, right?

26:56.129 --> 27:00.575
My boyfriend is gonna get worried
and come looking for me, Tom.

27:10.477 --> 27:12.511
If I don't show up,
he'll come looking for me.

27:12.512 --> 27:14.592
He knows where I work.

27:18.585 --> 27:22.599
How long have you guys been
dating or hanging out?

27:23.456 --> 27:25.968
- Two years.
- Two years?

27:27.862 --> 27:32.137
- Do you live together?
- That's none of your fucking business.

27:33.567 --> 27:36.512
That's not very nice dinner talk.

27:38.006 --> 27:40.712
Yeah, we live together, okay?

27:44.980 --> 27:46.957
Two years...

27:47.784 --> 27:53.621
That's more than a boyfriend.
That sounds like wedding bells.

27:53.622 --> 27:55.793
Do you have any plans?

27:56.125 --> 28:00.604
- Yes.
- What does your fiancé do?

28:01.229 --> 28:02.563
He's a journalist.

28:02.564 --> 28:06.367
I knew he had to be smart.
What kind of journalist?

28:06.368 --> 28:09.037
- Sports.
- What paper?

28:09.038 --> 28:11.039
<i>- Post.</i>
- I read <i>The Post.</i>

28:11.040 --> 28:13.342
- What's his name?
- Mark Clayton.

28:13.343 --> 28:18.017
Clayton. I don't
remember that name.

28:19.950 --> 28:25.124
- I have one over here.
- It's <i>The Post</i> online.

28:33.297 --> 28:36.071
It's amazing

28:36.101 --> 28:40.336
that you're able to keep a relationship
with the amount of hours you work.

28:40.337 --> 28:44.819
He must get really lonely when
you have to work late, right?

28:47.011 --> 28:49.022
Do you love him?

28:49.849 --> 28:52.018
Does he love you?

28:56.857 --> 29:01.996
I'm only asking because I'm worried about
how quickly he's going to get here.

29:03.028 --> 29:05.972
I'm sure he's already on his way.

29:09.602 --> 29:14.073
Right. He's probably on the
Harlem River Drive as we speak.

29:14.074 --> 29:16.374
- What kind of car does he drive?
- I don't know.

29:16.375 --> 29:18.610
You don't know what kind
of car your fiancé drives?

29:18.611 --> 29:23.661
- Toyota, I think.
- Toyota. That is a fast car.

29:23.751 --> 29:26.797
He can be here a lot sooner
than I was thinking.

29:27.286 --> 29:30.391
He could be coming down
this ramp right now.

29:39.332 --> 29:43.346
You haven't been very
talkative since we met.

29:45.373 --> 29:50.046
But now you're telling me all about

29:51.078 --> 29:54.785
your boyfriend.
Oh, sorry, your fiancé.

29:55.919 --> 30:01.558
So either we've become best friends
over dinner or you're lying to me.

30:02.558 --> 30:04.467
I'm guessing

30:04.961 --> 30:07.062
you're lying to me.

30:11.100 --> 30:14.010
You don't really have
a boyfriend, do you?

30:14.403 --> 30:16.573
But you want one.

30:17.673 --> 30:22.051
You want somebody who
cares about you...

30:23.146 --> 30:27.349
- Worries about you...
- Please, don't.

30:27.350 --> 30:30.795
You've got a great family.

30:32.188 --> 30:34.790
You've got Lorraine.

30:35.592 --> 30:39.197
Jimmy and Rose. They love you.

30:41.264 --> 30:44.437
They're probably getting
worried about you.

30:45.569 --> 30:48.672
Maybe we should give
them a call. Yeah?

30:49.306 --> 30:51.579
Tell them you're okay.

30:53.210 --> 30:55.449
What do you think?

31:09.528 --> 31:11.870
What should we say?

31:13.431 --> 31:17.401
I know. We should say
you made other plans.

31:17.402 --> 31:20.677
No. You probably
already said that one.

31:20.874 --> 31:24.147
You know what? You should
think of something.

31:24.912 --> 31:27.014
You're a good liar.

31:28.114 --> 31:30.126
Go ahead.

31:31.617 --> 31:33.424
Go!

31:33.519 --> 31:35.292
No.

31:47.969 --> 31:51.737
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

31:51.738 --> 31:56.077
Hey, Rosie. Can you get
your mommy on the phone?

31:56.078 --> 31:58.247
<i>Who's calling, please?</i>

31:58.846 --> 32:02.655
- It's Auntie Angie.
<i>- Mommy, it's Aunt Angie.</i>

32:03.117 --> 32:06.823
<i>LORRAINE: Give me a second,
okay? Hey, where are you?</i>

32:07.288 --> 32:10.223
<i>- Angela?</i>
- I'm not feeling well.

32:10.224 --> 32:13.062
<i>What do you mean?
We're all waiting for you.</i>

32:13.063 --> 32:14.628
<i>She says she's not feeling well.</i>

32:14.629 --> 32:18.833
<i>MAN: That's what she said the last time.
LORRAINE: Can I talk to my sister, please?</i>

32:18.834 --> 32:20.200
<i>Where are you, Angie?</i>

32:20.201 --> 32:22.782
<i>MOTHER: She's got
a real job. It's not like...</i>

32:23.039 --> 32:24.810
<i>LORRAINE: Angela?</i>

32:25.407 --> 32:28.409
I went home.

32:28.410 --> 32:30.578
<i>MOTHER:
What's wrong? Where is she?</i>

32:30.579 --> 32:32.647
<i>LORRAINE: I don't understand.
Last time I talked to you,</i>

32:32.648 --> 32:35.516
<i>you were on your way.
What about the costume?</i>

32:35.517 --> 32:38.921
<i>MAN: Let's just eat. You should
know your sister by now.</i>

32:38.922 --> 32:40.188
<i>LORRAINE:
It would be nice if you'd try</i>

32:40.189 --> 32:42.157
<i>and put your family ahead
of your work sometimes.</i>

32:42.158 --> 32:44.460
<i>MOTHER:
That's enough. Give me the phone.</i>

32:44.461 --> 32:46.734
<i>Angie, what's wrong?</i>

32:47.631 --> 32:51.166
<i>Hello? I can't hear her.</i>

32:51.167 --> 32:53.903
<i>Sweetie? Can you hear me?</i>

32:53.904 --> 32:58.543
- Hi, Mom. I'm here.
<i>- Honey, what happened? Where are you?</i>

32:59.111 --> 33:01.088
I don't know.

33:02.080 --> 33:03.813
I think it's the flu.

33:03.814 --> 33:08.488
<i>You really sound terrible.
Are you sure you're okay?</i>

33:08.987 --> 33:13.865
Yeah. I just need some rest.

33:14.160 --> 33:15.760
<i>Okay.</i>

33:15.761 --> 33:19.830
<i>Rest up and hopefully you'll
feel better for lunch tomorrow.</i>

33:19.831 --> 33:23.275
<i>And don't worry about
the costume, okay?</i>

33:23.335 --> 33:27.940
<i>- Merry Christmas, angel. I love you.</i>
- I love you too, Mom.

33:39.686 --> 33:43.233
That was the best Christmas
present anyone's ever given me.

33:44.991 --> 33:46.763
Thank you.

33:47.694 --> 33:50.570
And now I have a present for you.

34:12.319 --> 34:14.195
Go ahead.

34:15.091 --> 34:16.760
Open it.

34:20.062 --> 34:22.471
Aren't you even curious?

34:22.864 --> 34:25.239
Open it.

34:27.902 --> 34:29.982
Yes.

34:40.382 --> 34:42.016
Bet you're curious now.

34:42.016 --> 34:43.918
(LAUGHING)

34:43.918 --> 34:46.228
Okay. Enough torture.

34:50.994 --> 34:54.302
Watch. It's all cued up.

34:58.902 --> 35:02.073
- Why are you showing this to me?
- Wait.

35:29.201 --> 35:32.372
You fucked up now, asshole.

35:35.339 --> 35:37.783
Sorry you had to see that.

35:43.149 --> 35:45.785
You want to go for a stroll?

35:50.722 --> 35:55.897
These guys always do
whatever they want.

36:01.901 --> 36:03.741
Here we go.

36:06.706 --> 36:08.175
(ANGELA SCREAMING)

36:08.176 --> 36:10.617
Rocky, sit down!

36:19.553 --> 36:21.497
(GROANING)

36:22.324 --> 36:24.732
Why did you do that?

36:28.662 --> 36:31.244
Rocky, shut the fuck up!

36:34.336 --> 36:35.903
- Let me help you up.
- Don't.

36:35.904 --> 36:38.706
- Don't touch me!
- I'm not gonna hurt you. All right?

36:38.707 --> 36:39.807
You're hurting my arm.

36:39.808 --> 36:42.945
That's because you won't
relax your arms. Okay?

36:46.548 --> 36:49.416
- Come on.
- Just let me go. I won't tell anyone.

36:49.417 --> 36:53.431
Yeah, I believe you. I just
need to show you something.

37:10.240 --> 37:13.344
Let's put that all behind us, yeah?

37:14.011 --> 37:16.716
Here we go.

37:29.394 --> 37:31.338
Uh-oh.

37:31.763 --> 37:34.775
I think I drank too much wine.

37:35.500 --> 37:38.274
I really shouldn't be driving.

37:40.238 --> 37:42.251
I'm just kidding.

37:47.179 --> 37:50.213
You know, I've seen you drive
out of here so many times.

37:50.214 --> 37:53.387
Strange being in the car with you.

37:54.720 --> 37:56.654
It's great, actually.

37:56.655 --> 37:58.626
I thought you said we
were taking a drive.

37:58.752 --> 38:00.254
We are.

38:00.726 --> 38:03.399
Then why are we going down, Tom?

38:03.896 --> 38:06.341
It's freezing out there.

38:06.366 --> 38:10.573
Besides, this is gonna
be much better.

38:20.414 --> 38:22.890
Why are we down here, Thomas?

38:24.851 --> 38:26.522
Tom?

38:42.036 --> 38:43.979
(MUFFLED SCREAMING)

38:45.639 --> 38:47.810
Oh, my God, Tom.

38:48.377 --> 38:50.718
What is this?

38:51.079 --> 38:53.387
This is my present to you.

39:03.225 --> 39:07.602
I want you to take
this and show him.

39:09.331 --> 39:11.435
Show him what?

39:12.035 --> 39:14.470
Show him you're not a slut.

39:14.471 --> 39:19.075
Take this and teach him he can't
be touching every woman he wants.

39:21.210 --> 39:23.845
Are you talking about what
happened in the elevator?

39:23.846 --> 39:28.084
Oh, Tom, no. You don't
understand. That was a mistake.

39:28.085 --> 39:29.786
A stupid mistake.

39:29.787 --> 39:32.867
- What? He tried to rape you.
- No.

39:32.990 --> 39:36.493
He got a little out of hand at a party,
Tom. He hardly tried to rape me.

39:36.494 --> 39:40.870
Look, he was drunk. He apologized.

39:41.365 --> 39:44.071
Oh, he apologized.

39:44.169 --> 39:46.702
You think you're the first
woman he tried to do this to?

39:46.703 --> 39:49.305
I've seen him try to touch
every woman in the building.

39:49.306 --> 39:53.320
- He's a pervert. A degenerate.
- No.

39:54.179 --> 39:56.514
He's a good man, Tom.

39:56.515 --> 40:01.351
Look at him. He has a family.
He has a wife. Tom, please don't.

40:01.352 --> 40:04.655
Tom, Tom... Stop calling
out my name, all right?

40:04.656 --> 40:06.256
I know what you're trying to do.

40:06.257 --> 40:08.860
You're trying to humanize yourself,
like you're some poor victim.

40:08.861 --> 40:12.730
I told you, I'm not gonna
hurt you! All right?

40:12.731 --> 40:15.133
Stop calling out my name!
Enough's enough!

40:15.134 --> 40:18.681
Tom, Tom, Tom! How many
times can you say it?

40:18.737 --> 40:20.511
Okay.

40:29.381 --> 40:32.929
I know you're a person, okay?

40:33.120 --> 40:35.063
I'm a person, too.

40:35.422 --> 40:38.935
I know you have feelings.
I have feelings, too.

40:40.060 --> 40:42.573
I care about your feelings.

40:42.829 --> 40:48.436
He's the one you should be scared of.
He's the one who has no feelings.

40:49.470 --> 40:52.016
So if you want to help him,

40:52.940 --> 40:56.647
take this and teach him a lesson.

41:01.315 --> 41:05.454
I told you, he apologized.

41:05.554 --> 41:08.489
What? He can just apologize
and then he can do it again?

41:08.490 --> 41:10.423
And then he's just gonna
apologize again and then...

41:10.424 --> 41:12.827
You've got to stop letting these
assholes have their way with you!

41:12.828 --> 41:17.765
Tom, please believe me. It was
just a misunderstanding, Tom.

41:17.766 --> 41:22.872
Tom, Tom! Just stop calling
out my name! I told you!

41:23.205 --> 41:26.810
- Didn't I?
- Yes! Yes.

41:27.309 --> 41:31.949
- I'm sorry, but you're scaring me.
- Jesus! When are you gonna understand?

41:33.750 --> 41:37.355
I'm here to help you.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

41:50.433 --> 41:52.342
Okay.

41:55.607 --> 41:57.447
I'll do it.

41:59.077 --> 42:01.623
You untie me and I'll do it.

42:07.720 --> 42:11.766
No. Oh, no. Whoa.

42:11.790 --> 42:14.462
You're a good person.

42:14.859 --> 42:16.227
You're a good person, too.

42:16.228 --> 42:19.064
I should have never asked
you to do this. I'm sorry.

42:19.065 --> 42:24.102
No. It's okay because I want to.

42:24.103 --> 42:29.448
You just have to untie me
and I'll do it for you.

42:39.086 --> 42:41.654
No, no. It's my job to protect you.

42:41.655 --> 42:46.058
No, Tom, listen to me. It's not.
