00:32.323 --> 00:34.618
<i>There are times
when we make history,</i>

00:35.244 --> 00:38.039
<i>and there are times
when history makes us.</i>

00:39.331 --> 00:41.709
<i>This is a crucial moment
for our nation,</i>

00:42.126 --> 00:46.797
<i>and America's colors burn brightest
when we meet challenges head on.</i>

00:46.922 --> 00:48.049
<i>For far too long,</i>

00:49.050 --> 00:52.636
<i>the wealthiest 1%
have seen their fortunes only grow</i>

00:53.095 --> 00:54.930
<i>while the rest of the nation
lies in worry.</i>

00:55.056 --> 00:57.850
<i>That needs to change.</i>

00:57.975 --> 01:01.020
The question is, how do we pay for it?

01:01.145 --> 01:03.481
<i>But the question is,
how do we pay for it?</i>

01:03.939 --> 01:07.443
It's not even in the vicinity
of what we agreed on. No!

01:07.568 --> 01:08.944
This is not a quid pro quo.

01:09.070 --> 01:12.948
This is "You do what I say when I say it
or you suffer the consequences."

01:13.574 --> 01:15.326
Uh, it's beyond bedti--

01:15.451 --> 01:18.829
- Penny, you need to go to sleep right now.
- Let me talk to her.

01:20.331 --> 01:22.625
No, you can't talk to Dad.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.168
Let me talk to her. Come on.

01:24.710 --> 01:26.003
<i>And not just here at home...</i>

01:26.128 --> 01:27.671
Hello?

01:28.005 --> 01:28.881
<i>Hi, Daddy.</i>

01:29.006 --> 01:29.840
Who is this?

01:29.965 --> 01:31.092
It's Penny.

01:31.217 --> 01:32.259
<i>Penny who?</i>

01:32.384 --> 01:35.262
- Penny Kirkman, your daughter.
<i>- No.</i>

01:35.387 --> 01:36.680
That's not possible. My daughter's asleep.

01:36.806 --> 01:38.349
I know that because
I kissed her good night...

01:38.474 --> 01:40.810
almost two hours ago.

01:40.935 --> 01:43.354
- When are you and Mommy coming home?
<i>- It doesn't matter.</i>

01:43.479 --> 01:45.397
You're gonna be asleep by then, right?

01:46.357 --> 01:47.233
Right?

01:48.609 --> 01:50.236
She can't keep pulling this.

01:50.361 --> 01:51.445
I've got an idea.

01:51.821 --> 01:53.280
What if you go to bed right now

01:53.405 --> 01:56.909
and I let you stay up an extra hour
tomorrow night so we can hang out?

01:57.034 --> 01:59.245
<i>- Sound like a deal?</i>
- Deal.

01:59.370 --> 02:00.162
<i>That's my girl.</i>

02:00.287 --> 02:01.288
Give me a kiss.

02:03.582 --> 02:04.542
Good night, Daddy.

02:04.667 --> 02:05.960
Good night, little pea.

02:06.460 --> 02:07.878
See? All good.

02:08.461 --> 02:09.880
Not all good.

02:10.005 --> 02:11.715
- What do you mean, not all good?
- Tom!

02:12.758 --> 02:14.176
You can't do that.

02:14.301 --> 02:16.637
You can't make promises
that you won't be able to keep.

02:16.762 --> 02:19.223
We're in Washington. They're
the only promises we're allowed to make.

02:21.058 --> 02:24.895
You know, you need to learn
how to set some limits with her.

02:25.437 --> 02:29.441
Because if not,
she is gonna walk all over you.

02:29.567 --> 02:30.818
I know.

02:30.943 --> 02:31.902
You're right.

02:32.611 --> 02:37.616
<i>...values that we hold dear,
that represent who we are...</i>

02:38.367 --> 02:39.702
Here come the greatest hits.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.954
<i>...to ensure you
that the same American dream</i>

02:42.079 --> 02:45.082
<i>shared by our fathers, our mothers,</i>

02:45.207 --> 02:46.876
<i>and their fathers and--</i>

02:49.420 --> 02:50.880
That's weird.

02:55.593 --> 02:56.969
- What is it?
- Won't come back on.

02:57.094 --> 02:58.387
See if you can get it to work.

02:58.512 --> 02:59.763
Okay.

02:59.889 --> 03:00.764
Yeah.

03:01.223 --> 03:03.225
No, I know. Ours just went black, too.

03:03.350 --> 03:04.393
Tom!

03:05.519 --> 03:07.438
- Oh, my God!
- I'll get back to you.

03:08.355 --> 03:09.773
Mr. Secretary,
you need to put the phone down.

03:09.899 --> 03:11.817
- Mike, what the hell is going on?
- Put the phone down.

03:11.942 --> 03:13.485
We've lost contact with the Capitol.

03:13.611 --> 03:15.237
We're sheltering in place
until we know more.

03:15.362 --> 03:16.655
I need your government-issued BlackBerry.

03:16.780 --> 03:18.574
- What?
- Do you have any other devices on you?

03:18.699 --> 03:20.701
- There...
- Please, check your bag, ma'am.

03:20.826 --> 03:22.494
But I... But I... I need--

03:22.620 --> 03:24.330
<i>We are getting reports</i>

03:24.455 --> 03:27.958
<i>of some kind of explosion
in or around the Capitol building.</i>

03:28.083 --> 03:29.335
<i>We are still...</i>

03:40.763 --> 03:43.098
Mr. Secretary,
get away from the window, now!

03:43.224 --> 03:44.225
Oh, my God.

03:49.396 --> 03:50.314
Oh.

04:08.832 --> 04:11.335
I thought you said
you were gonna get some sleep.

04:12.586 --> 04:13.837
I'm okay.

04:14.546 --> 04:17.216
National Sleep Foundation
recommends seven hours

04:17.341 --> 04:19.426
to function as a normal human being.

04:19.885 --> 04:21.762
A working mother only needs four.

04:22.221 --> 04:24.348
Uh, correction, only gets four.

04:28.519 --> 04:30.479
Hi.

04:35.442 --> 04:36.819
- No.
- Hmm!

04:36.944 --> 04:40.030
- I'm not doing anything.
- Tom, I have-- Stop it. I have work to do.

04:40.155 --> 04:41.282
So do I, and it's a two-person job.

04:41.407 --> 04:44.243
Come on. You've always said
you're always on my side.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.620
Mm. Yes.

04:46.745 --> 04:48.122
That's all I want.

04:53.043 --> 04:54.420
- Mom!
- No, no, no, no.

04:54.545 --> 04:55.838
Go away!

04:55.963 --> 04:57.006
Dad!

04:57.131 --> 04:58.257
Get out here! I'm hungry!

04:58.382 --> 05:00.926
- I want some breakfast!
- Leave us alone! You are not loved!

05:02.553 --> 05:04.805
Please!

05:04.930 --> 05:06.724
- No.
- Are you kidding?

05:08.058 --> 05:09.935
Okay. You're gonna get
what you deserve.

05:10.060 --> 05:11.478
- I'm making breakfast.
- No.

05:11.603 --> 05:13.063
- Pancakes for everyone!
- Please, no!

05:13.188 --> 05:14.440
Let me go, woman!

05:14.565 --> 05:16.108
Oh, God.

05:16.233 --> 05:18.402
Okay, little pea.
How do you like your eggs?

05:18.527 --> 05:19.903
Scrambled or scrambled?

05:20.029 --> 05:22.031
Um, scrambled, please.

05:22.156 --> 05:24.783
Excellent.
Scrambled eggs coming up

05:24.908 --> 05:27.161
for the beautiful girl
sitting at the counter.

05:28.704 --> 05:31.373
And... there we go.

05:31.749 --> 05:33.959
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

05:34.084 --> 05:35.753
Leo. Perfect timing. What do you want?

05:35.878 --> 05:36.628
Uh...

05:37.421 --> 05:38.505
He's making breakfast?

05:38.630 --> 05:41.633
- Unfortunately.
- Hey, I'm slaving over here.

05:41.967 --> 05:44.261
- I'll just get some toast.
- Toast, toast.

05:44.386 --> 05:46.180
That's made with bread, right?

05:46.847 --> 05:48.724
Come on, you used
to always laugh at my jokes.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.267
I used to be nine.

05:50.392 --> 05:51.310
Ah, the good ol' days.

05:51.435 --> 05:53.228
I need you to watch
your sister tonight, okay?

05:53.354 --> 05:55.689
- No. I can't do it. I'm busy.
- I know, watching your sister.

05:55.814 --> 05:58.525
Come on, it's a big night for me.
I've got the State of the Union.

05:58.650 --> 06:00.527
For me, too. I told Caleb
I'd help him out with something.

06:00.652 --> 06:02.821
- With what?
- It doesn't matter.

06:02.946 --> 06:04.365
Doesn't matter because I won't like it

06:04.490 --> 06:06.450
or doesn't matter
'cause I won't understand?

06:06.950 --> 06:07.826
Both.

06:07.951 --> 06:10.454
Okay, now I really want to know.

06:10.579 --> 06:13.916
He's laying down a new dubstep track,
and I need to write a program for him.

06:16.126 --> 06:17.920
I understood "him."

06:18.045 --> 06:20.130
On a scale of 1 to 10,
how much do I embarrass you?

06:20.255 --> 06:22.383
- 11.
- Excellent.

06:22.841 --> 06:24.760
Hey, you finish your English paper yet?

06:24.885 --> 06:26.720
- Uh, in theory.
- Finish it!

06:27.846 --> 06:30.516
You can take them, right?
I have to be at court by 9.

06:30.641 --> 06:31.767
Yeah, I got 'em.

06:33.227 --> 06:34.103
Bye, peanut.

06:34.228 --> 06:34.937
Bye, Mommy.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.355
Make us proud.

06:39.149 --> 06:41.652
<i>...immigration reform,
but the sad truth of the matter</i>

06:41.777 --> 06:44.029
<i>is that Richmond can promise
all he wants tonight,</i>

06:44.154 --> 06:47.199
<i>this Congress
isn't gonna lift a finger to help him.</i>

06:48.992 --> 06:51.870
This can't be good if it won't wait
till I get to the office.

06:51.995 --> 06:53.122
How about the end of days?

06:53.247 --> 06:54.873
I just spoke to Gillings
at Cabinet Affairs.

06:54.998 --> 06:56.917
He slipped me a final copy
of Richmond's address

06:57.042 --> 06:59.253
and not a single one
of our talking points are included.

06:59.378 --> 07:01.713
You're kidding me.
Not even housing reform?

07:01.839 --> 07:05.300
All of it, everything you and I have
worked our asses off on for months, gone.

07:05.426 --> 07:08.137
Okay, okay. Just get me a meeting
with Langdon as soon as possible.

07:08.262 --> 07:10.013
Already done.
We're going there now.

07:10.139 --> 07:11.181
It's time to war up.

07:11.306 --> 07:12.641
Easy, Hannibal.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.102
We should also talk
about leaking your plan to <i>Politico</i>

07:15.227 --> 07:17.396
- if this doesn't work.
- No, that'll backfire.

07:17.521 --> 07:18.730
Maybe, but it'll be out there.

07:18.856 --> 07:21.525
Tonight is about what's in
the State of the Union, not what's not.

07:21.650 --> 07:25.028
We can't let the White House take
an eraser to our entire domestic agenda.

07:25.154 --> 07:27.239
You're the Secretary of Housing
and Urban Development.

07:27.364 --> 07:29.741
It's the President's domestic agenda, Em.

07:29.867 --> 07:31.827
It's your domestic agenda, Mr. Secretary.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.620
I'll make my argument for it.

07:33.745 --> 07:35.164
Don't get me wrong. I'm as mad as hell.

07:35.289 --> 07:37.708
At the end of the day, I'm not
the President of the United States.

07:37.833 --> 07:38.709
We should remember that.

07:40.210 --> 07:42.838
All right. Then let's go see
the Chief of Staff.

07:43.881 --> 07:44.965
Thank you very much.

07:45.090 --> 07:47.759
...tell the American people how
we're doing, we need to get specific.

07:47.885 --> 07:50.762
Could one of you find me
something heavy to hit Mr. Wright with?

07:50.888 --> 07:53.098
We need to take a look
at the AB-33 section.

07:53.223 --> 07:55.350
The message is muddled.
I wrote it, and I don't know what it says.

07:55.476 --> 07:57.936
That is the mark
of a successful political speech.

07:58.061 --> 07:59.480
Well done. Now, go forth.

08:00.898 --> 08:02.900
- Mr. Secretary, welcome. Please.
- Charlie.

08:03.025 --> 08:05.444
I'm sure you remember Aaron Shore,
my Deputy Chief of Staff.

08:05.569 --> 08:07.279
- Aaron, good to see you.
- Mr. Secretary.

08:07.404 --> 08:09.615
I'm gonna hazard a guess
and say you're not here

08:09.740 --> 08:11.867
to discuss which color tie
the President is wearing tonight.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.036
That is his call...

08:14.161 --> 08:16.663
if he'll put back in
the Secretary's housing initiatives.

08:16.788 --> 08:19.708
These are programs that can help
millions of low-income families.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.460
No one's debating its value here, Emily.

08:21.585 --> 08:24.338
Charlie, there's not a single mention

08:24.463 --> 08:27.007
of any of my programs
in the speech tonight? Not a one?

08:27.132 --> 08:29.885
I'm sorry, but that's how it's gonna be.
The speech is locked.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.554
Does the President value
the Secretary's opinion, Charlie?

08:32.679 --> 08:34.097
Because right now, it's hard to tell.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.182
Em.

08:36.850 --> 08:37.976
Give us a moment.

08:39.977 --> 08:41.355
I'll meet you outside.

08:49.571 --> 08:50.739
What's going on, Charlie?

08:51.448 --> 08:54.868
Well, Tom, we were gonna wait till after
the State of the Union to tell you this,

08:54.993 --> 08:56.745
but the President's looking
to make a change.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.997
He would like to offer you
an ambassadorship

08:59.122 --> 09:01.083
to the International
Civil Aviation Organization.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.834
Are you serious?

09:03.502 --> 09:06.338
Was the Chairman of the International
House of Pancakes unavailable?

09:06.463 --> 09:07.506
Tom...

09:10.300 --> 09:11.552
Wow.

09:13.595 --> 09:16.098
This is really not how I saw today going.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.228
Uh...

09:22.479 --> 09:24.189
The Civil Aviation Committee--

09:24.314 --> 09:25.607
- Organization.
- Organization.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.317
Is that even a real thing, Charlie?

09:27.442 --> 09:30.612
Of course it's a thing.
It's in Montreal. It's under the UN.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.698
Look, it affords you
the rank of ambassador

09:32.823 --> 09:34.533
with all the trimmings
that go along with it.

09:34.658 --> 09:37.035
Come on, Charlie.
We've done some good work here.

09:37.160 --> 09:39.580
And we've got lots left to do, I mean...

09:40.038 --> 09:43.250
I have supported this president
above and beyond for his entire term.

09:43.375 --> 09:44.918
Well, now it's about the second term.

09:45.043 --> 09:47.504
And I serve at the pleasure
of the President.

09:47.629 --> 09:49.381
So do you, Tom.

09:52.259 --> 09:55.637
Don't they realize
what a huge asset you are for them?

09:55.762 --> 09:57.806
Langdon actually tried
to pass it off as a promotion.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.766
You can't take this lying down.

09:59.891 --> 10:01.893
- How else do you want me to take it?
- Fight.

10:02.019 --> 10:03.020
Look, he appointed you,

10:03.145 --> 10:04.605
but he can't fire you.

10:04.730 --> 10:07.357
- You need to hold your ground.
- What do you want me to do?

10:07.482 --> 10:09.860
Go to war with
the President of the United States?

10:09.985 --> 10:13.113
The White House never respected you.
That's the real problem.

10:13.238 --> 10:16.116
No, Alex. The real problem is I didn't
play Richmond's game all the time.

10:16.241 --> 10:17.284
Oh, Tom, come on!

10:17.409 --> 10:19.077
It's called politics.

10:19.202 --> 10:20.579
And maybe if you did--

10:20.704 --> 10:22.664
What? I wouldn't be out of a job?

10:22.789 --> 10:24.666
Maybe but I'd be just like
one of those guys.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.543
When I got into this, we had a deal.

10:26.668 --> 10:30.672
- I wasn't gonna be one of those guys--
- Tom, it's taken three years.

10:32.174 --> 10:34.801
And we finally settled into Washington.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.678
I love my job.

10:37.179 --> 10:38.805
Penny loves her school.

10:38.930 --> 10:40.265
Even Leo's making friends.

10:40.390 --> 10:42.726
We can't do this to our family.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.062
I know.

10:48.607 --> 10:50.025
You're right.

10:54.112 --> 10:56.073
Come here. Come here.

10:56.198 --> 10:57.324
Hey.

10:58.075 --> 10:59.159
I love you.

11:01.411 --> 11:02.996
We'll make this work.

11:06.249 --> 11:07.334
I'll commute.

11:07.459 --> 11:08.335
What?

11:08.460 --> 11:10.504
So, you've made up your mind?

11:11.129 --> 11:12.589
You're stepping down?

11:12.714 --> 11:14.716
I told them I'd give them
my decision tomorrow.

11:17.511 --> 11:19.429
- Wow.
- Alex.

11:25.894 --> 11:27.145
Great.

11:27.270 --> 11:28.230
Yeah?

11:31.525 --> 11:33.527
What's a designated survivor?

11:33.902 --> 11:35.404
Mr. Secretary, we need to leave now.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.030
- Tom!
- Did you see that?

11:37.155 --> 11:38.323
- Tom!
- Did you see that?

11:38.448 --> 11:41.618
...to smoke out any ambush.
White House is secure. Let's go.

12:12.107 --> 12:15.026
Mike, please, just tell us what you know.

12:15.152 --> 12:17.195
Capitol's been attacked.

12:17.946 --> 12:19.740
There's still no word on the President

12:19.865 --> 12:22.534
or his detail.

12:22.659 --> 12:23.660
This is Ritter.

12:28.331 --> 12:31.042
Oh, God.
Don't tell me that.

12:31.168 --> 12:32.627
What is it?

12:33.670 --> 12:34.963
It's confirmed.

12:36.339 --> 12:37.424
Eagle is gone.

12:38.175 --> 12:40.719
- Congress, the Cabinet.
- Oh, oh, my God.

12:41.178 --> 12:42.471
None of them made it.

12:43.180 --> 12:44.347
Yes, sir.

12:45.348 --> 12:46.475
I'll let him know.

12:49.352 --> 12:52.439
Mr. Secretary, we're enacting
continuity of government.

12:52.564 --> 12:55.025
A DC appellate judge
will meet us at the White House.

12:55.859 --> 12:59.696
Sir, you are now the President
of the United States.

13:07.078 --> 13:09.664
<i>Incredibly alarming live shot.</i>

13:09.790 --> 13:12.292
<i>The United States
Capitol Building in flames.</i>

13:12.417 --> 13:15.295
<i>An explosion, should I say
an unconfirmed explosion,</i>

13:15.420 --> 13:17.380
<i>going off just moments ago</i>

13:17.506 --> 13:19.424
<i>during President Richmond's
State of the Union address.</i>

13:19.549 --> 13:21.009
<i>Of course, we're reaching out</i>

13:21.134 --> 13:22.886
<i>to all of our sources...</i>

13:23.011 --> 13:24.721
Pick up. Come on.

13:24.846 --> 13:27.182
<i>Hi. This is Scott.
I'm not available right now.</i>

13:27.307 --> 13:28.934
<i>Please leave me a message
after the beep.</i>

13:30.310 --> 13:32.604
Hey, it's me.
Call me when you get this.

13:33.522 --> 13:35.106
I need to know you're okay.

13:38.902 --> 13:39.903
Hey, Scott?

13:40.028 --> 13:41.947
<i>No, it's Doug.
I need you here right away.</i>

13:42.072 --> 13:43.240
Yes, sir. I'm on my way.

14:11.643 --> 14:12.477
Ma'am...

14:12.602 --> 14:13.728
We got to get our kids here.

14:13.854 --> 14:15.730
We've already sent agents
to bring them here.

14:39.045 --> 14:40.505
Sir, please.

14:40.630 --> 14:42.173
Sir, please.

14:43.717 --> 14:45.677
Ma'am, please hold the Bible.

14:46.678 --> 14:47.888
Just hold the Bible. Thank you.

14:48.722 --> 14:51.182
Sir, place your left hand
on the Bible and repeat after me.

14:51.308 --> 14:53.977
"I, Thomas Adam Kirkman,
do solemnly swear..."

14:54.102 --> 14:56.688
I, Thomas Adam Kirkman,
do solemnly swear...

14:56.813 --> 14:58.648
"...that I will faithfully
execute the office

14:58.773 --> 15:00.567
of President of the United States..."

15:00.692 --> 15:02.319
...that I will faithfully
execute the office

15:02.444 --> 15:03.695
of President of the United States...

15:03.820 --> 15:06.281
"...and will,
to the best of my ability..."

15:06.907 --> 15:08.617
...and will, to the best of my ability...

15:08.742 --> 15:12.746
"...preserve, protect, and defend
the Constitution of the United States."

15:12.871 --> 15:16.541
...preserve, protect, and defend
the Constitution of the United States,

15:16.666 --> 15:18.293
so help me God.

15:18.418 --> 15:19.961
Mr. President.

15:20.921 --> 15:23.381
- Ma'am.
- Mr. President, come with me now.

15:23.506 --> 15:25.926
Mrs. Kirkman, the Secret Service
will take you up to the residence.

15:26.051 --> 15:28.428
- Ma'am, please come with me.
- Mr. President.

15:29.804 --> 15:30.931
Right now.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.433
Please.

15:41.691 --> 15:43.068
Aaron, where are we going?

15:43.193 --> 15:45.236
The Presidential Emergency
Operations Center.

15:59.960 --> 16:03.380
...status report
on every team we have worldwide.

16:03.505 --> 16:06.132
I want every drone waiting on full staff
and deployable...

16:06.257 --> 16:07.634
Excuse me.

16:07.759 --> 16:09.970
Can you do that?
Well, get it done.

16:10.637 --> 16:11.680
Excuse me.

16:14.391 --> 16:16.226
Hey, hey! Hey!

16:17.852 --> 16:19.813
I need you all to be quiet right now.

16:20.647 --> 16:21.815
Please.

16:22.983 --> 16:26.403
Let's take a moment for
our fallen friends, heroes one and all.

16:42.502 --> 16:43.837
Thank you.

16:47.007 --> 16:48.591
Maybe we should go around the table.

16:49.467 --> 16:50.593
Where's the CIA director?

16:50.719 --> 16:52.512
We're still working
to set up a secure comm.

16:52.637 --> 16:55.348
The hell with secure comms.
We have to get him patched in now.

16:55.473 --> 16:58.101
Cellphone, landline, Skype,
whatever we got.

16:58.226 --> 16:58.977
Who's got the networks?

16:59.102 --> 17:01.312
Okay, you tell them
we'll be live in 60 minutes

17:01.438 --> 17:02.856
from the East Room, okay?

17:02.981 --> 17:05.567
Nobody talks to any press
of any office or agency

17:05.692 --> 17:07.318
under threat
of me ripping your insides out.

17:07.444 --> 17:09.069
Do we know who's responsible for this?

17:09.194 --> 17:11.698
- Still too early to determine.
- We got to give them something, Karen.

17:11.823 --> 17:13.199
The whole world's watching us right now.

17:13.324 --> 17:15.743
Exactly. We need to alert
every one of our embassies

17:15.868 --> 17:19.998
to convey to each host nation
that the U.S. is on a war footing

17:20.123 --> 17:22.416
and now is not the time to test us.

17:23.501 --> 17:26.046
Patch me into 24-hour watch
at the Pentagon.

17:26.421 --> 17:29.924
Inform the surviving joint chiefs
we are going to DEFCON 2.

17:30.050 --> 17:31.217
You can't make that call.

17:31.342 --> 17:33.636
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs is gone.

17:34.054 --> 17:35.764
That doesn't give you
any authority, Harris.

17:35.889 --> 17:37.932
We're under attack.
What more authority do you want?

17:38.058 --> 17:39.184
Who do you think you are?

17:39.309 --> 17:41.144
I want the Air Force flying in 15 minutes.

17:41.269 --> 17:44.147
- Who are you to give me orders?
- Who are you to question them, Peter?

17:44.272 --> 17:46.941
I'm not gonna sit on my ass
and hope for the best here.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.337
Let it all out, man.

18:07.462 --> 18:09.589
We're all feeling the same way tonight.

18:10.215 --> 18:11.883
Sorry. I thought I was alone.

18:12.008 --> 18:15.136
Yeah, well,
nothing is what it seems anymore.

18:15.261 --> 18:17.138
An hour ago,
I was throwing back tequila,

18:17.263 --> 18:20.642
celebrating the three lines
I got into a 10,000-word speech.

18:20.767 --> 18:23.228
Swear to God, I dunno how the hell
we're gonna get through this.

18:23.937 --> 18:25.146
Same way we always do.

18:25.271 --> 18:26.523
Yeah, right.

18:26.648 --> 18:28.399
Do you know who's in charge right now?

18:28.525 --> 18:31.069
I'm asking,
because I can't even remember his name.

18:31.194 --> 18:32.779
Kirkman. Tom Kirkman.

18:32.904 --> 18:35.365
Oh, yeah, yeah. Kirkland. That's right.

18:36.366 --> 18:38.076
The lowest rung on the ladder.

18:39.702 --> 18:42.122
Did you know President Richmond
fired him this morning?

18:42.539 --> 18:43.998
Now he's the President.

18:44.124 --> 18:47.836
He's the one the country's
gonna be turning to in our darkest hour.

18:49.712 --> 18:52.090
Well, maybe he'll surprise you.

18:53.633 --> 18:56.094
Yeah, you mean maybe he'll realize

18:56.219 --> 18:58.555
he has no business running the country?

18:58.680 --> 19:01.558
That he should just step aside,

19:01.683 --> 19:05.562
maybe let one of the generals take over,
or the CIA director,

19:05.687 --> 19:07.856
somebody who actually knows
what the hell they're doing?

19:10.066 --> 19:11.401
Fat chance of that happening.

19:12.443 --> 19:14.654
Nobody around here ever gives up power.

19:15.572 --> 19:17.240
Kirkland's a follower.

19:17.365 --> 19:18.741
We need a leader.

19:18.867 --> 19:21.744
I'm telling you, I got half a mind
to make a run to Canada.

19:21.870 --> 19:23.037
You know what I'm saying?

19:24.956 --> 19:25.999
Oh.

19:26.124 --> 19:27.667
Canada.

19:29.252 --> 19:30.795
Uh, Mr. President.

19:32.046 --> 19:34.382
Do you really believe
everything you just said?

19:34.507 --> 19:35.884
Uh, Mr. President, let me explain.

19:36.009 --> 19:37.051
What's your name?

19:38.595 --> 19:39.512
Seth Wright.

19:39.637 --> 19:42.015
Seth Wright. You're a speechwriter.

19:42.140 --> 19:44.684
I saw you coming out
of Charlie's office earlier this morning.

19:44.809 --> 19:46.769
You were arguing
about the President's address.

19:46.895 --> 19:49.689
Uh, the AB-33 section.

19:52.025 --> 19:53.276
Housing reform.

19:57.197 --> 19:59.407
You really think I should step down?

20:02.702 --> 20:03.536
I do.

20:05.413 --> 20:07.081
You may be right.

20:08.875 --> 20:11.753
But for now, I'm all you got,
and you have...

20:12.545 --> 20:14.672
exactly 52 minutes to write a speech

20:14.797 --> 20:17.383
convincing the American people
that that's a good thing.

20:25.808 --> 20:26.726
Penny!

20:26.851 --> 20:27.936
Mommy!

20:49.666 --> 20:50.708
All right, listen up.

20:50.833 --> 20:53.378
No one comes in or out without tin.

20:53.503 --> 20:56.297
I want a secure perimeter,
at least five blocks out.

20:56.422 --> 20:59.342
I want TSA screening equipment
installed now.

20:59.467 --> 21:01.094
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

21:01.219 --> 21:02.470
All right, back to work.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.014
You'll also want to send up
thermo UAVs and air sniffers

21:05.139 --> 21:07.225
to look for anything biological
or radiological in the area.

21:07.350 --> 21:08.935
Hannah, you were supposed
to report to HQ.

21:09.060 --> 21:10.645
I was 10 blocks away.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.689
Any survivors?

21:13.189 --> 21:14.607
No, not yet.

21:14.732 --> 21:16.317
EMS is digging through the rubble.

21:17.652 --> 21:18.653
Make sure Hazmat knows--

21:18.778 --> 21:21.572
Agent Wells, you're SIOC, okay,
you're not a field agent.

21:21.698 --> 21:23.992
I need you heading up a crisis team
at the operations center.

21:24.117 --> 21:26.577
You don't need me behind a computer.
You need me here.

21:26.703 --> 21:28.079
- I worked both bomb sites...
- Hannah--

21:28.204 --> 21:30.039
...on the ground in Brussels and Paris.

21:30.498 --> 21:32.208
I know what to look for.

21:32.333 --> 21:33.251
Jason...

21:35.044 --> 21:36.879
Please, I need to be here.

21:43.511 --> 21:45.305
Nolan. Lawrence.

21:45.430 --> 21:46.639
Yes, Deputy Director?

21:46.764 --> 21:47.849
You're with Wells.

21:48.725 --> 21:49.892
Anyone claiming responsibility?

21:50.018 --> 21:50.977
No, not yet.

21:51.102 --> 21:54.605
I want the license plates of every car
parked in the next three blocks scanned.

21:54.731 --> 21:58.026
If any are stolen or owned by anyone
on a watch list, tear it apart.

21:58.151 --> 21:59.819
Mark, bomb disposal techs, CSI,

21:59.944 --> 22:02.030
we catalog what we find
and where we found it.

22:02.155 --> 22:03.072
Let's move.

22:39.776 --> 22:43.196
<i>Thomas Adam Kirkman
was born December 29th, 1967,</i>

22:43.321 --> 22:44.864
<i>in Port Washington, New York.</i>

22:44.989 --> 22:46.574
<i>Before being appointed</i>

22:46.699 --> 22:48.659
<i>Secretary of Housing
and Urban Development,</i>

22:48.785 --> 22:51.162
<i>Kirkman worked in academia
as an educator...</i>

22:51.287 --> 22:52.330
This is insane.

22:52.455 --> 22:53.956
Guy's never been elected to anything.

22:54.082 --> 22:56.209
He ran HUD.
They find affordable homes for people,

22:56.334 --> 22:58.711
which makes Kirkman
a glorified real-estate agent.

22:58.836 --> 23:02.090
- He was next in the line of succession.
- I'm sorry, no one could've foreseen this.

23:02.215 --> 23:04.759
Why the hell do you think
there's a designated survivor, Nikki?

23:04.884 --> 23:06.177
Because this was foreseen.

23:06.302 --> 23:08.137
Now shut up and let me work.

23:26.489 --> 23:27.240
Hey.

23:28.616 --> 23:30.243
Hey.

23:30.368 --> 23:31.953
What are you doing out here?

23:32.495 --> 23:33.830
I just needed a minute.

23:35.456 --> 23:37.125
How's Penny?

23:37.250 --> 23:38.084
Ah, God.

23:38.209 --> 23:40.378
Scared. Confused.

23:40.503 --> 23:43.089
You know, just like everyone, I guess.

23:43.214 --> 23:45.258
Is this even happening?

23:46.843 --> 23:48.928
What the hell am I doing here, Alex?

23:50.430 --> 23:52.140
I'm not the guy for this.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.184
You want to quit?

23:55.309 --> 23:57.812
I know it's not the right thing to say,

24:00.606 --> 24:03.109
- but I can't help but feel--
- Like running for our lives.

24:05.069 --> 24:06.362
Yeah.

24:06.487 --> 24:08.072
Tom, maybe we should.

24:10.032 --> 24:12.285
Look what happened tonight.

24:12.410 --> 24:15.872
How many people...
We haven't even processed.

24:16.456 --> 24:17.707
And our kids?

24:19.000 --> 24:21.586
Are we putting them in danger?
I mean...

24:24.881 --> 24:26.340
We're a target now.

24:26.466 --> 24:27.758
Are they?

24:27.884 --> 24:29.552
I-I-I don't know--

24:29.677 --> 24:31.846
- Mr. President.
- Yeah?

24:31.971 --> 24:33.764
You said Leo
was at a friend's house tonight.

24:33.890 --> 24:35.016
Yeah, Caleb West.

24:35.141 --> 24:37.643
I just spoke to our agents
at his residence, Leo wasn't there.

24:37.768 --> 24:38.561
He never was.

24:38.686 --> 24:39.687
What?

24:39.812 --> 24:40.980
Where is he?

24:41.105 --> 24:42.482
We don't know.

24:43.774 --> 24:45.443
They're gonna find Leo.

24:46.402 --> 24:47.487
Mike knows him.

24:48.279 --> 24:50.323
Secret Service.
They're the best in the world at this.

24:53.284 --> 24:54.494
I know.

24:55.077 --> 24:56.913
Mr. President. This way, please.

24:57.038 --> 24:59.081
Please give me a sec.

25:00.458 --> 25:02.335
I got this.

25:10.801 --> 25:11.844
After you.

25:14.639 --> 25:16.432
This is Major Cameron.

25:17.642 --> 25:20.853
Mr. President,
this is the nuclear football.

25:22.271 --> 25:24.273
It'll be with you
whenever you leave the White House.

25:24.398 --> 25:27.652
These are the launch codes,
verification codes,

25:27.777 --> 25:31.822
a listing of every classified location
capable of launching nuclear weapons.

25:31.948 --> 25:33.658
In the event of an imminent strike,

25:33.783 --> 25:35.910
you can green-light it using this phone.

25:36.744 --> 25:39.205
It works anywhere on Earth
as well as beneath it.

25:39.747 --> 25:42.667
Do you need my fingerprints
or an eye scan or something?

25:43.251 --> 25:45.753
No, sir. It's not like the movies.

25:45.878 --> 25:47.046
It doesn't work that way.

25:49.340 --> 25:50.132
Of course.

25:50.258 --> 25:53.553
Mr. President,
the UN is in emergency session.

25:53.678 --> 25:56.556
I have a three-page phone list
with every one of our enemies

25:56.681 --> 25:58.766
calling to deny responsibility
for the attack.

25:58.891 --> 26:01.477
All US military bases
are on full alert,

26:01.602 --> 26:03.312
and the USS Eisenhower
is currently hard charging

26:03.437 --> 26:05.565
towards the Fifth Fleet
stationed in the Persian Gulf.

26:05.690 --> 26:07.400
I understand alerting our bases, but...

26:07.858 --> 26:10.486
why are we hard-charging
a US aircraft carrier anywhere?

26:10.611 --> 26:12.613
Mr. President, in the event of an attack--

26:12.738 --> 26:13.781
An attack from who?

26:13.906 --> 26:16.367
You just said all our enemies
are denying responsibility.

26:16.492 --> 26:18.327
Because all warfare is based on deception

26:18.452 --> 26:20.371
and there are still plenty
we haven't heard from.

26:20.496 --> 26:23.040
I just don't feel comfortable
showing that kind of force yet.

26:23.165 --> 26:25.751
With all due respect, sir,
would you mind telling us

26:25.876 --> 26:28.588
when you do plan
on being comfortable?

26:29.297 --> 26:31.048
You'll be the first to know, General.

26:31.173 --> 26:32.133
Excuse me.

26:47.815 --> 26:49.609
Pleasure doing business with you.

26:51.277 --> 26:53.696
<i>♪ Freedom take me tonight ♪</i>

26:54.614 --> 26:56.866
<i>♪ Staring up at the sky... ♪</i>

26:57.617 --> 27:00.077
- How many more bags you got?
- I just sold my last two.

27:00.202 --> 27:00.995
Still got three left.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.913
Save 'em. We got to bounce anyway.

27:03.039 --> 27:04.081
Screw that.

27:04.206 --> 27:06.334
I came here to make money
and have some fun.

27:09.462 --> 27:12.006
<i>♪ Nothing's ever been so clear ♪</i>

27:14.675 --> 27:16.427
- Leo!
- Get off me, man!

27:18.387 --> 27:19.472
Mike?

27:20.473 --> 27:21.766
What are you doing here?

27:27.563 --> 27:28.981
How'd you find me?

27:29.106 --> 27:30.274
It wasn't easy.

27:30.399 --> 27:32.860
We had to open up an ops center at NSA,

27:32.985 --> 27:35.863
run the phone records of all your friends
and classmates through PRISM

27:35.988 --> 27:37.907
till we could piece together
enough chatter keywords

27:38.032 --> 27:40.159
to trace your digital footprint
to the club.

27:41.035 --> 27:41.869
Really?

27:41.994 --> 27:43.704
No, Leo.

27:43.829 --> 27:45.581
We pinged your phone.

27:46.540 --> 27:49.001
You're not exactly a criminal mastermind.

27:53.923 --> 27:55.591
I thought you were taking me home.

27:57.885 --> 27:59.720
I am.

28:01.681 --> 28:03.849
Everyone
is at a complete loss for words.

28:03.974 --> 28:06.268
This is the most devastating
attack on our country since 9/11.

28:06.394 --> 28:07.895
And staffers at the White House

28:08.020 --> 28:10.898
are asking the same question
as the rest of the country:

28:11.023 --> 28:13.901
who's behind this horrific act of terror?

28:14.026 --> 28:14.860
Come on... Look!

28:14.985 --> 28:16.737
Can you check again?
My name's Emily Rhodes.

28:16.862 --> 28:19.031
I'm Secretary Kirkman's Chief of Staff.

28:19.156 --> 28:20.658
He was the designated survivor tonight.

28:20.783 --> 28:22.618
I told you,
you're not on the cleared list.

28:22.743 --> 28:23.869
I was in there this morning.

28:23.994 --> 28:26.122
A lot's happened since then,
in case you haven't noticed.

28:27.248 --> 28:28.916
Step back from the gate.

28:29.041 --> 28:31.377
Intelligence sources
are being tight-lipped

28:31.502 --> 28:33.337
about what has happened
at the Capitol today,

28:33.462 --> 28:36.507
but as of yet,
no one has claimed responsibility

28:36.632 --> 28:39.009
and our nation
remains on high alert.

28:39.135 --> 28:41.137
Thank you for your prayers,
Madam Prime Minister.

28:41.887 --> 28:43.013
You, too.

28:43.139 --> 28:44.432
Goodbye.

28:45.474 --> 28:46.726
Right, where were we?

28:46.851 --> 28:48.352
Uh, the presidential voice.

28:48.477 --> 28:50.855
Which, apparently, I don't have.

28:51.564 --> 28:53.899
You can defend my honor at any time.

28:54.024 --> 28:57.069
I will... when he says something
I disagree with.

28:57.194 --> 28:59.530
Okay, so, what do you think
the presidential voice is?

28:59.655 --> 29:02.199
Uh, "All of us here know
there is work to be done.

29:02.324 --> 29:05.745
We have a responsibility
to light the way for every American."

29:05.870 --> 29:07.246
Sounds good to me.

29:07.371 --> 29:09.874
I imagine it would.
You said it two years ago

29:09.999 --> 29:13.085
in Atlanta
at the Conference for the New Urbanism.

29:13.210 --> 29:14.420
Sir...

29:15.963 --> 29:18.382
Tonight, you're speaking to the world.

29:18.507 --> 29:20.468
America doesn't need
another friend right now.

29:20.593 --> 29:23.053
You can't be relaxed or disarming.
That's not gonna work anymore.

29:24.472 --> 29:28.392
Mr. President, you need to be
stronger than you've ever been before.

29:29.393 --> 29:30.853
We all need that right now.

29:34.273 --> 29:35.483
What is it, Tom?

29:36.984 --> 29:38.277
I've got to go.

29:41.197 --> 29:42.948
Just sit down.

29:46.202 --> 29:48.913
It's okay. We're all feeling it.

29:49.872 --> 29:50.831
Thank you, ma'am.

29:50.956 --> 29:52.291
Alex, please.

29:52.416 --> 29:54.084
Uh, no, ma'am.

29:54.794 --> 29:56.086
You're the First Lady.

30:00.883 --> 30:01.801
Hey.

30:01.926 --> 30:03.803
No, no. Please, sit down.

30:04.512 --> 30:06.972
Sat imagery shows
10 Iranian Navy destroyers

30:07.097 --> 30:08.599
leaving Bandar Abbas port

30:08.724 --> 30:11.477
and taking up positions
along the Strait of Hormuz.

30:11.602 --> 30:14.230
The Strait of Hormuz is where
30% of the world's oil passes through.

30:14.355 --> 30:15.356
I know, Aaron.

30:15.481 --> 30:17.942
Mr. President,
this is a purposeful provocation

30:18.067 --> 30:20.778
by the Iranians to take advantage
of the night's events

30:20.903 --> 30:24.573
and choke off the Western world's
main supply of oil.

30:24.698 --> 30:28.160
Just as we're on our knees,
they're gonna step on our throat.

30:35.793 --> 30:37.837
Aaron.
I finally got past the gate--

30:37.962 --> 30:40.589
I can't talk right now.
I need to get back to the PEOC.

30:40.714 --> 30:42.299
- Is Tom gonna be there?
- It's his meeting.

30:42.424 --> 30:43.551
Then I'm coming with you.

30:43.676 --> 30:45.469
Sorry, Emily,
but it's code-word clearance only.

30:45.594 --> 30:47.388
I've been with Secretary Kirkman's staff
for three years.

30:47.513 --> 30:50.140
It's President Kirkman now,
and you're not authorized.

30:50.266 --> 30:52.059
If you're choosing this moment
for a pissing contest--

30:52.184 --> 30:54.186
That's my point, Emily.
This is no contest.

30:54.979 --> 30:55.938
Now, if you'll excuse me--

30:56.063 --> 30:58.983
President Kirkman needs people he knows
by his side.

30:59.650 --> 31:02.736
You and I have our differences, I know,
and you don't want me in there.

31:03.279 --> 31:04.989
But you also know better than anyone else

31:05.114 --> 31:07.783
why it is important
that I am there for him right now.

31:12.204 --> 31:13.789
How many more ways can I say this?

31:13.914 --> 31:16.667
In the morning, our economy
is going to go over a cliff

31:16.792 --> 31:19.420
and the Iranians
are just seizing the moment.

31:20.129 --> 31:22.882
What do you want me to do, General?
Declare war?

31:24.258 --> 31:27.303
Why not? 40 minutes ago,
they showed me the nuclear football.

31:27.803 --> 31:30.014
I guess I've had it long enough
to try it out.

31:30.139 --> 31:31.140
We've just been attacked.

31:31.265 --> 31:33.225
The world thinks it can test us right now,

31:33.350 --> 31:36.228
and a full, swift show of force
is the only way to remind them

31:36.353 --> 31:38.230
that our flag
is still flying strong tonight.

31:38.355 --> 31:41.692
And all I'm saying is that I think
there are different ways to show force.

31:41.817 --> 31:43.861
What you need to understand
is the Iranians respect

31:43.986 --> 31:46.697
only one course of action,
and that is action.

31:46.822 --> 31:50.784
This is not some consumer group
waiting for a photo op with a figurehead.

31:53.829 --> 31:55.122
Figurehead.

31:56.373 --> 31:59.627
Well, General, this figurehead paid
attention during the Cabinet meetings,

31:59.752 --> 32:01.211
where we dealt with this very issue.

32:01.337 --> 32:03.881
And the Iranians have tried
to close off the Strait of Hormuz

32:04.006 --> 32:08.218
for the last 35 years, so I am having
a difficult time believing...

32:08.552 --> 32:10.721
that they just up
and decided to do that tonight.

32:10.846 --> 32:12.973
And how can you be so certain of that?

32:24.193 --> 32:26.528
When is the Iranian ambassador
due to arrive?

32:26.654 --> 32:27.821
15 minutes.

32:29.156 --> 32:31.033
Okay, General,
you can scramble your bombers,

32:31.158 --> 32:33.202
but they are not to engage.

32:35.079 --> 32:36.956
We are going to do this my way.

32:37.831 --> 32:39.875
If it doesn't work, we'll try yours.

32:43.253 --> 32:46.382
I know you're scared, peanut,
but everything's gonna be okay.

32:47.508 --> 32:49.301
But why are we here?

32:52.846 --> 32:55.891
'Cause this, uh...
this is gonna be our new home.

32:56.016 --> 32:57.601
But why?

32:58.060 --> 33:02.898
Because some bad people
did something bad tonight,

33:03.023 --> 33:05.526
and it's Dad's job
to make sure we're all safe.

33:06.944 --> 33:08.278
Are you scared?

33:08.404 --> 33:09.947
Yeah.

33:11.740 --> 33:13.117
Is Daddy?

33:13.659 --> 33:15.077
Are you kidding?

33:17.663 --> 33:19.164
Dad's not scared of anything.

33:30.634 --> 33:33.053
<i>Hi. This is Scott.
I'm not available right now.</i>

33:33.178 --> 33:35.055
<i>Please leave me a message
after the beep.</i>

33:35.180 --> 33:36.724
It's me again.

33:38.475 --> 33:39.727
Where are you?

33:39.852 --> 33:43.105
Please call me back and...
and tell me you're okay.

33:44.690 --> 33:45.941
I love you.

33:47.067 --> 33:49.111
Agent Wells. I was looking for you.

33:51.864 --> 33:52.906
Are you okay?

33:54.825 --> 33:56.577
- Yeah.
- Did you lose someone?

33:59.121 --> 34:01.540
I think we all lost someone.
What do you got?

34:02.291 --> 34:06.128
I checked all the license plates
in the area against every watch list.

34:06.253 --> 34:07.546
Nothing so far.

34:07.671 --> 34:10.299
All right, get in touch with the NSA.
Make sure they know--

34:10.424 --> 34:11.632
We got something over here!

34:13.177 --> 34:15.763
- What do we got?
- UXO! We got a UXO!

34:18.056 --> 34:20.266
All right. Clear the area!

34:20.391 --> 34:21.685
We've got a bomb!

34:21.810 --> 34:23.603
Back up now!

34:23.728 --> 34:25.481
Clear the area now!

34:36.658 --> 34:39.453
Perimeter is secure.
You may proceed.

34:39.578 --> 34:41.163
Copy that.

34:46.918 --> 34:48.462
All clear. Open it up.

34:48.587 --> 34:51.172
<i>Okay. Removing the outer case.</i>

35:01.266 --> 35:02.267
Hemostat.

35:09.733 --> 35:10.818
What do you see?

35:11.944 --> 35:13.237
Wires to the fuse compartment,

35:14.863 --> 35:16.115
to the creep spring,

35:17.950 --> 35:19.284
to the detonator.

35:19.409 --> 35:20.619
But no pressure plate.

35:22.121 --> 35:23.288
Easy.

35:28.210 --> 35:29.378
It's clear.

35:30.963 --> 35:32.381
<i>Bomb's a dud.</i>

35:41.223 --> 35:42.891
Is he here?

35:43.016 --> 35:45.269
Yes, he's... he's waiting just outside.

35:46.353 --> 35:47.229
Send him in.

35:49.940 --> 35:51.150
Mr. Ambassador.

35:53.652 --> 35:55.154
Mr. Ambassador.

35:55.279 --> 35:56.989
Mr. President.

35:57.114 --> 35:57.990
Please.

35:58.115 --> 35:59.283
Thank you.

36:02.286 --> 36:04.037
Please, allow me to begin

36:04.163 --> 36:06.874
by extending
to you and the American people

36:06.999 --> 36:10.961
my country's most sincere sympathies
on this horrific tragedy.

36:11.086 --> 36:13.505
If there is anything our people can do

36:13.630 --> 36:17.384
in response
to this tremendous act of cowardice,

36:17.509 --> 36:19.261
rest assured, we will do it.

36:19.386 --> 36:21.013
I appreciate that.

36:22.014 --> 36:25.142
You can begin by removing your destroyers
from the Strait of Hormuz.

36:26.018 --> 36:28.854
Mr. President, excuse me,

36:28.979 --> 36:31.481
but I believe you have been misinformed.

36:31.607 --> 36:32.733
Is that a fact?

36:32.858 --> 36:34.234
Yes. We... we have moved

36:34.359 --> 36:36.653
no such destroyers
into the Strait of Hormuz.

36:36.778 --> 36:38.989
My defense department
has war-gamed this out.

36:39.114 --> 36:41.158
They're waiting for me
to give them the green light,

36:41.283 --> 36:42.701
which, I assure you, I will do

36:42.826 --> 36:45.162
unless you pull your destroyers
back to Bandar Abbas

36:45.287 --> 36:46.872
within the next three hours.

36:46.997 --> 36:48.415
Mr. President, I would--

36:48.540 --> 36:51.418
Mr. Ambassador,
you may not know much about me,

36:51.960 --> 36:54.171
but what you should know
is I'm about as straight a shooter

36:54.296 --> 36:56.256
as you're gonna find in Washington.

36:56.381 --> 36:59.176
You should believe me
when I tell you that I do not want,

36:59.301 --> 37:03.138
as my first act as Commander in Chief,
to attack Iran.

37:03.764 --> 37:05.224
But as both of us know,

37:05.349 --> 37:08.560
it's not always up to us
how history plays itself out.

37:08.685 --> 37:10.354
Now, I have chosen to believe

37:10.479 --> 37:13.482
that your country is not playing
on our emotions tonight,

37:13.607 --> 37:15.651
but nevertheless,
you will feel the full impact of them

37:15.776 --> 37:17.694
if you do not comply with my demands.

37:17.819 --> 37:21.198
Mr. Ambassador, dock your destroyers...

37:21.907 --> 37:23.492
or the lead story on the morning news

37:23.617 --> 37:26.078
will not be about the attack
on our capital

37:26.536 --> 37:28.914
but the devastating attack on yours.

37:29.039 --> 37:31.416
Please, Mr. Ambassador,

37:31.541 --> 37:34.253
let's not get off
on the wrong foot here tonight.

37:35.295 --> 37:38.548
Mr. President,
I will speak with my government.

37:39.007 --> 37:40.509
Thank you, Mr. Ambassador.

37:42.678 --> 37:44.513
Mr. Ambassador, this way.

37:48.475 --> 37:49.810
Mr. Ambassador.

37:52.396 --> 37:53.939
Three hours.

38:19.006 --> 38:20.632
Haven't seen one of those before.

38:20.757 --> 38:22.926
It's a Soviet-era anti-tank mine.

38:23.051 --> 38:25.012
There are still thousands of them
in Afghanistan.

38:25.137 --> 38:28.598
Jihadist terror groups have been using
them for years as their primary IEDs.

38:29.057 --> 38:30.309
Hannah, you hearing this?

38:31.727 --> 38:32.978
Agent Wells, the bomb is--

38:33.103 --> 38:34.688
Is an unexploded munition
you think was used

38:34.813 --> 38:37.774
by a Mideast terror group -
either ISIS, Al-Qaeda, or the Taliban -

38:37.899 --> 38:40.652
to blow up our Capitol.
Yes, I heard you.

38:41.945 --> 38:43.196
And that's one theory.

38:43.322 --> 38:44.865
You got another one?

38:46.325 --> 38:47.993
All right.

38:48.118 --> 38:50.287
In the weeks leading up to the big ones -

38:50.412 --> 38:52.414
9/11, Paris, Belgium -

38:52.539 --> 38:54.374
the chatter we were getting
was off the charts.

38:54.499 --> 38:57.461
Something was coming, you know?
We just didn't know what it was.

38:57.961 --> 38:59.421
Do you know what I'm hearing now?

38:59.796 --> 39:00.839
Nothing.

39:02.174 --> 39:05.093
No breaks in any of the routines
of the mosques or camps we're inside,

39:05.218 --> 39:07.095
no one is relocating
their wives or children

39:07.220 --> 39:09.264
in anticipation of our counterattacks.

39:09.723 --> 39:12.184
It's business as usual.
That makes no sense.

39:13.435 --> 39:15.604
So, you're saying the bomb
isn't one of theirs.

39:15.729 --> 39:18.607
I'm saying that if they did this,
they'd be crowing right now.

39:18.732 --> 39:22.569
There is a reason the people who did this
are keeping silent about it.

39:22.694 --> 39:23.737
And that is?

39:27.657 --> 39:30.535
You don't take credit for something
until you're done, right?

39:32.371 --> 39:34.206
So, what if they're just getting started?

39:41.671 --> 39:44.883
I don't remember this suit.

39:45.967 --> 39:47.636
I had to borrow it.

39:53.725 --> 39:55.143
You look the part.

39:57.020 --> 39:59.439
I know this is gonna change
everything for us,

40:00.524 --> 40:01.817
but I have to do it.

40:03.026 --> 40:04.277
If I don't...

40:07.155 --> 40:08.407
I just have to.

40:10.659 --> 40:12.327
You still on my side?

40:13.620 --> 40:15.497
I'm always on your side...

40:16.623 --> 40:18.375
Mr. President.

40:20.127 --> 40:21.545
Something needs to be done, Aaron.

40:21.670 --> 40:24.297
I think we're doing everything
that's expected of us, Harris.

40:25.006 --> 40:26.550
That's not what I'm talking about.

40:30.053 --> 40:32.431
What exactly are you talking about here?

40:33.515 --> 40:35.100
Because if it's what I think it is,

40:35.225 --> 40:37.436
this conversation's
going to be treading dangerously close

40:37.561 --> 40:39.062
to conspiracy to commit treason.

40:39.187 --> 40:41.273
We have a Housing
and Urban Development Secretary

40:41.398 --> 40:43.024
running the free world.

40:43.150 --> 40:46.361
You call it treason.
I call it my civic responsibility.

40:46.486 --> 40:49.072
You're talking
about removing a sitting president.

40:49.197 --> 40:51.158
An unelected president, yes.

40:51.867 --> 40:53.118
Listen to me.

40:53.243 --> 40:57.330
If the country's gonna survive,
we need to act swiftly and definitively.

40:57.873 --> 40:59.749
Tom Kirkman will not get us through this.

40:59.875 --> 41:01.835
And let me guess, you can?

41:01.960 --> 41:03.211
We're in a state of war.

41:04.129 --> 41:06.089
Who would you rather have leading us?

41:30.572 --> 41:32.115
Uh, Mr. President.

41:33.575 --> 41:34.576
Your glasses.

41:35.243 --> 41:37.037
They're not very presidential, sir.

41:37.162 --> 41:38.288
Right.

41:40.624 --> 41:41.666
Thank you.

41:47.756 --> 41:51.885
Mr. President,
you're live in five, four, three...

41:54.262 --> 41:55.764
My fellow Americans...
