13:04.742 --> 13:06.869
Let’s have Drac go next.

13:06.952 --> 13:08.412
Yeah! [CHUCKLES]

13:08.496 --> 13:12.791
Hmm, if I was gonna hide a box for
the flying-est vampire kid in class,

13:12.875 --> 13:15.002
where would I put it?

13:15.085 --> 13:19.840
Oh! Found it! Oh, I
wonder what’s inside.

13:19.924 --> 13:22.013
Well, those are
definitely vampire fangs,

13:22.020 --> 13:24.059
so I know it’s something for my tooth!

13:24.595 --> 13:26.263
How exciting!

13:26.347 --> 13:30.476
Hmm... I think it’s...
Uh, maybe it’s...

13:30.559 --> 13:31.977
Oh, it’s a fang brush!

13:32.061 --> 13:33.354
[GASPS] Oops.

13:33.437 --> 13:35.940
I didn’t mean to do that. Sorry, Drac.

13:36.023 --> 13:39.485
[LAUGHS] It's okay, Zoe. Whoa!

13:41.111 --> 13:43.239
Thanks, Esmie. Thanks, Igor.

13:44.448 --> 13:46.909
I like having a clean, shiny fang.

13:47.785 --> 13:50.663
Hey! Those bricks weren’t here before.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.544
[GRUNTS AND LAUGHS]

13:57.378 --> 14:00.673
This is gonna be awesome, I can tell.

14:00.756 --> 14:04.385
Okay, uh, lightning
bolts and pencils. Just...

14:04.468 --> 14:08.806
[GRUNTS] I can guess
this... I almost have it...

14:08.889 --> 14:09.974
I...

14:11.267 --> 14:14.019
A giant eraser! What a great prize!

14:14.103 --> 14:18.232
[GASPS] Oh, bats! I spoiled the game...

14:18.315 --> 14:21.902
No, you didn’t, Zoe. I
still got to smash things.

14:22.987 --> 14:26.198
And I still get to
keep the eraser, right?

14:26.282 --> 14:30.202
Of course, Frankie. We
picked it out just for you.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.789
- Okay, Katya’s next.
- [GASPS]

14:35.124 --> 14:37.164
Miss Esmie, could I wait outside?

14:37.171 --> 14:40.260
I don’t want to spoil
any more surprises.

14:40.337 --> 14:43.382
Sometimes it can be hard
to control your powers.

14:43.465 --> 14:45.634
Especially when you get excited.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.846
Why don’t you stay here with us,

14:48.929 --> 14:52.349
and we’ll try taking a
deep breath and looking away

14:52.433 --> 14:54.894
if it feels too exciting. Okay?

14:54.977 --> 14:56.395
Okay.

14:57.062 --> 15:02.443
Magic wand before my eyes,
show me how to find my prize!

15:07.948 --> 15:10.576
Deep breath. Look away.

15:11.410 --> 15:15.539
This is so exciting. [GASPS] I
can’t wait to see what it is.

15:15.623 --> 15:18.375
Deep breath. Look away. [GASPS]

15:20.419 --> 15:26.675
A book of spells! Oh,
I did it again! Sorry.

15:27.551 --> 15:28.802
Don’t worry, Zoe.

15:28.886 --> 15:33.223
I have to practice my magic all
the time and I still make mistakes.

15:33.307 --> 15:36.314
And I practice controlling
my strength, and

15:36.321 --> 15:38.985
I still break things. A lot of things.

15:39.063 --> 15:42.399
- Aw. Thanks, guys.
- [ALL CHUCKLE]

15:43.817 --> 15:45.611
- [HOWLS]
- Okay, Lobo.

15:45.694 --> 15:47.071
I can’t wait, I can’t
wait, I can’t wait!

15:47.154 --> 15:49.907
I wonder where your box could be?

15:49.990 --> 15:52.826
[SNIFFS AND HOWLS]

15:53.661 --> 15:56.205
Aw! This is gonna be so great.

16:11.470 --> 16:14.223
At least that’s one
surprise I didn’t spoil.

16:14.932 --> 16:18.060
My turn! I just love prizes.

16:18.143 --> 16:22.731
And surprises. And prizes
that are surprises. Huh...

16:39.415 --> 16:41.834
Deep breath, don’t look.

16:41.917 --> 16:45.629
This is such beautiful wrapping paper.

16:45.713 --> 16:47.756
Deep breaths, don’t look.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.925
Whoa! What do you think it is?

16:50.009 --> 16:52.511
Don't look... [WHIMPERS]

16:52.594 --> 16:56.724
Oh! It’s a coloring
book about ancient Egypt!

16:56.807 --> 16:58.350
Zoe, want to color with me?

16:58.434 --> 17:00.936
Huh? Where did she go?

17:04.189 --> 17:05.398
Oh! She went this way!

17:05.482 --> 17:07.693
[ZOE COUGHS] Deep breath...

17:07.776 --> 17:12.071
Ew! This is the smelliest,
stinkiest closet I’ve ever been in!

17:12.823 --> 17:14.366
We found her!

17:14.450 --> 17:16.201
But the door’s locked.

17:16.285 --> 17:18.203
I’ll go look for the key.

17:18.287 --> 17:20.736
Hopefully Zoe can survive smelling your

17:20.742 --> 17:23.506
stinky old shoes until you get back.

17:23.584 --> 17:25.252
[CHUCKLES]

17:25.335 --> 17:27.588
Zoe, please open the door.

17:27.671 --> 17:30.007
[ZOE] Uh-uh. I’m gonna stay in here

17:30.090 --> 17:33.260
until I can keep from
spoiling everyone’s fun.

17:33.343 --> 17:37.139
- But you didn’t spoil our fun.
- You just got really excited.

17:37.222 --> 17:39.433
It happens to all of us.

17:39.516 --> 17:43.103
Well, if Zoe’s not coming
out, we have to find our way in.

17:43.187 --> 17:46.065

17:54.990 --> 17:57.701
It’s okay, Frankie, you didn’t mean to.

17:57.785 --> 17:59.161
No, he didn’t.

17:59.244 --> 18:01.478
And you didn’t mean to use your zombie

18:01.485 --> 18:04.130
vision to see the prizes in the boxes.

18:04.208 --> 18:06.335
You’re right! I didn’t.

18:06.418 --> 18:10.005
Frankie and I both need to
keep practicing our powers,

18:10.089 --> 18:11.882
until we can control them better.

18:11.965 --> 18:13.342
We all do.

18:13.425 --> 18:17.387
I know a way we can practice
our powers and have fun too!

18:17.471 --> 18:19.014
Let’s play hide-and-seek!

18:19.098 --> 18:21.892
- Okay. Who’s gonna be it?
- You are!

18:21.975 --> 18:25.187
You can try and find us without
using your zombie vision.

18:25.270 --> 18:27.189
It’ll be good practice.

18:27.272 --> 18:30.734
I can do that! Or at least I’ll try.

18:31.735 --> 18:36.073
Everybody ready? One, two, three...

Nine, ten! Ready or not, here I come!

[GASPS] Katya, why aren’t you hiding?

19:02.307 --> 19:05.853
I am. [WHISPERS] I’m invisible.

19:08.438 --> 19:12.317
- Uh-uh.
- Oh! [CHUCKLES]

19:12.401 --> 19:17.364
- I really do need to practice my magic!

- Got you, Lobo!
- [LAUGHS] That was fun!

- Whoa.
- What a pretty statue.

19:59.489 --> 20:02.534
It's almost as pretty as Cleo.

- I did!

not even once!
