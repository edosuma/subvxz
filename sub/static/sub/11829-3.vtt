Previously on "The Secret
Life of the American Teenager"...

00:03.000 --> 00:04.500
Did you tell your parents about...?

00:05.500 --> 00:06.200
No.

00:06.200 --> 00:09.000
OK, people only know
that Amy had sex with Ricky.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.700
So were you with that Amy girl,
the one in the band?

00:11.700 --> 00:13.400
I was only with her the one time.

00:13.400 --> 00:14.600
You've got competion.

00:14.600 --> 00:16.200
What, that total loser Ricky?

00:16.200 --> 00:17.300
They slept together.

00:17.800 --> 00:20.400
If you're interested in Ricky,
I won't go out with him.

00:20.400 --> 00:21.200
I'll back off.

00:21.200 --> 00:22.800
Are you telling people
that we did something?

00:22.800 --> 00:24.700
You didn't tell your two girlfriends,

00:24.700 --> 00:26.300
and your two girlfriends
didn't tell anyone?

00:26.300 --> 00:28.400
I made a mistake,
but I do love her.

00:28.600 --> 00:29.500
Excuse me?

00:29.500 --> 00:30.600
You're lying?

00:30.600 --> 00:32.700
When you do,your face turns bright red,

00:32.700 --> 00:35.300
you get little beads of sweat
on your forehead,

00:35.300 --> 00:37.500
and if it's a really big lie,
you start stuttering again.

00:37.500 --> 00:41.100
Teenaged guys in high school are only
 interested in one thing, and that's sex.

00:41.100 --> 00:42.200
You love this girl,

00:42.800 --> 00:45.700
and you don't know
for sure that she slept with Ricky.

00:45.700 --> 00:48.100
Ricky told you that
we were telling people that?

00:48.100 --> 00:51.200
Hey, you!
I can't believe you told him.

00:51.200 --> 00:54.500
Ben apparently doesn't care if Amy had
some one-night fling with the drummer boy.

00:54.500 --> 00:55.400
He's above all that.

00:55.400 --> 00:57.200
As long as it wasn't more than that.

00:57.200 --> 00:59.700
You embarrassed me
in front of the whole school.

01:00.000 --> 01:00.700
I'm sorry.

01:01.500 --> 01:03.600
I was thinking that maybe
we should talk about

01:03.600 --> 01:04.900
what you heard about me.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.500
The thing with the drummer?

01:07.100 --> 01:10.900
Forget about it. Really,
it's none of my business.

01:10.900 --> 01:12.800
I've never had a boyfriend.
Ever.

01:12.800 --> 01:15.100
Oh. Well,
I've never had a girlfriend,ever.

01:15.100 --> 01:17.100
- I just...
- Love me?

01:17.800 --> 01:18.500
Yeah.

What?It's hot out here.

01:30.200 --> 01:32.800
Please tell me you kept 
that sweater on at school.

01:32.800 --> 01:35.100
Yes, I kept the sweater on at school.

01:35.600 --> 01:37.500
What's wrong with showing
a little cleavage, anyway?

01:37.500 --> 01:40.400
Be mysterious. Less is more.

01:40.400 --> 01:42.000
I thought this is what you meant.

01:45.500 --> 01:48.900
Give me a break. She's 13, you pervert.

01:49.600 --> 01:50.500
Anne?

01:51.900 --> 01:54.300
Oh, Dr. Hightower. Hi.

01:54.300 --> 01:55.900
You're out of the office early.

01:55.900 --> 01:58.600
Oh, but I guess you can do that 
now that you got a new partner.

01:59.900 --> 02:02.100
Hi, Ashley. How's school going this year?

02:02.100 --> 02:04.200
Why?

02:04.200 --> 02:07.800
I knew I should have called you when
Dr. Bowman came into the practice.

02:07.800 --> 02:08.699
That's OK.

02:08.699 --> 02:11.500
You're under no obligation to make
me or my daughters feel comfortable

02:11.500 --> 02:14.900
just 'cause they're your patients and 
have been for their entire lives.

02:14.900 --> 02:18.400
Is that why you didn't bring the girls
in this summer for their school checkup

02:18.400 --> 02:20.100
because of Dr. Bowman?

02:20.200 --> 02:22.300
I thought you were on good terms 
with the Bowmans.

02:22.300 --> 02:25.200
Are you on good terms with 
your husband's ex-wife's husband?

02:25.200 --> 02:27.400
What? I'm not married.

02:27.400 --> 02:28.600
I'm surprised.

02:28.600 --> 02:29.400
Ash.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.800
Look, Anne, Marshall Bowman 
is a very good doctor,

02:33.800 --> 02:36.600
and you know my old partner
left when she had a baby,

02:36.600 --> 02:39.800
and he was having issues with the guys
he was in practice with,

02:39.800 --> 02:42.900
and - I'm sorry, Anne.

02:42.900 --> 02:44.400
Would you like a referral?

02:44.400 --> 02:45.200
Yes, I would.

02:45.900 --> 02:48.700
I'd also like to know why I got a bill 
from the insurance company for Amy

02:48.700 --> 02:52.000
when I know for a fact she's at least
 six months overdue for her physical.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.600
Bill? Gee, I don't know.

02:53.600 --> 02:56.500
I try not to get too involved
with the paperwork.

02:56.500 --> 02:58.500
Just try to focus on the patients.

02:58.500 --> 03:00.600
But I'll check on it for ya, I promise.

03:00.900 --> 03:02.700
Does he ever take an afternoon off?

03:02.700 --> 03:03.700
He does.

03:03.700 --> 03:07.700
He plays golf on Wednesday afternoon,
and I cover for him.

03:07.800 --> 03:11.600
And on Thursday afternoons,
I take off, so here I am.

03:11.600 --> 03:13.600
I'll call you and schedule something.

03:13.600 --> 03:16.300
All right. Bye, Ashley.

03:18.200 --> 03:20.000
Man, she is such a fake.

03:20.300 --> 03:22.200
Fake what? Fake doctor?

03:22.500 --> 03:24.300
No. A fake nice person.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.300
Who's the new guy, anyway?

03:27.900 --> 03:30.000
Your father's ex-wife's husband.

03:31.800 --> 03:34.200
She thinks she's so special
just 'cause she married a doctor.

03:34.800 --> 03:36.400
Come on, she's not sobad, is she?

03:36.400 --> 03:37.300
Are you kidding?

03:37.300 --> 03:39.200
She'd never let you wear that tube top.

03:39.200 --> 03:40.900
Well, you won't let me wear it, either.

03:40.900 --> 03:42.700
You're wearing it,aren't you?

03:44.200 --> 03:47.900
Yeah, well -Well, if it counts 
for anything, I feel fine.

03:47.900 --> 03:49.000
I don't need a checkup.

03:49.200 --> 03:50.600
It's a school requirement.

03:50.600 --> 03:52.300
They just haven't caught up with us yet.

04:02.900 --> 04:04.000
How am I gonna fix this?

04:04.400 --> 04:05.100
Fix what?

04:07.700 --> 04:09.400
Well, are we talking about it or not?

04:09.400 --> 04:13.400
Yeah.We're talking about the fact that
my clothes no longer fit because I'm fat.

04:13.600 --> 04:15.600
Maybe we could get you,like,
a big safety pin, 

04:15.600 --> 04:18.399
like those giant pins 
they put on diapers?

04:18.399 --> 04:20.000
How long is that gonna work?

04:20.000 --> 04:22.100
OK, why are you always so negative?

04:22.100 --> 04:24.100
I'm not negative,but sooner or later,

04:24.100 --> 04:27.800
you're gonna have to
tell your parents that you're... fat

04:28.500 --> 04:31.000
and why you're fat.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.500
Here, picked something up
for you at the gas station.

04:33.500 --> 04:37.500
Free with fill-up.

04:37.600 --> 04:39.600
You guys can have those if you want.

04:39.600 --> 04:43.600
No, that's OK.We have cars to fill up,
so I can get my own.

04:44.300 --> 04:45.500
Fine. Well, I'll take 'em.

04:47.800 --> 04:48.600
Hmm.

04:50.400 --> 04:54.400
Great.

05:51.900 --> 05:53.800
Darn thing's in love with me. Ha.

05:54.100 --> 05:56.500
Oh, man,you need help.

05:56.500 --> 06:00.000
No, no, I like the direction this is going.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.700
At least you're taking an interest in 
someone or something other than Amy.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.400
You're moving way too fast.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.100
But I mean,it's just a kiss.

06:06.200 --> 06:10.200
I mean, I've kissed her,but I really wanna 
kiss her like a man kisses a woman.

06:10.200 --> 06:13.100
Or like a guy kisses a bear in drag.

06:13.100 --> 06:15.900
If you're just doing this to 
compete with Ricky,don't do it.

06:15.900 --> 06:18.900
If you're not gonna kiss her,
what's the pointin going out with her?

06:19.600 --> 06:21.600
What's the point in the two of us going out?

06:22.600 --> 06:23.600
I don't know.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.200
What do you mean you don't know?

06:25.200 --> 06:27.100
Children, let's not fight.

06:27.100 --> 06:28.900
I wanna take that next step.I'm ready.

06:28.900 --> 06:29.900
I have a girlfriend.

06:29.900 --> 06:31.100
With Henry, you idiot.

06:31.900 --> 06:33.200
I wanna decide when.

06:33.200 --> 06:34.700
That's a man's right.

06:35.600 --> 06:36.900
No. Sorry, sorry.

06:37.400 --> 06:38.100
Don't say it.

06:38.500 --> 06:39.300
Privilege.

06:39.300 --> 06:40.300
It's my privilege.

06:40.600 --> 06:41.700
Don't be a control freak.

06:41.700 --> 06:43.400
Oh, I'm a control freak?And you?

06:43.400 --> 06:44.400
What?

06:44.400 --> 06:48.200
You're actually putting time and effort 
into planning a spontaneous moment

06:48.200 --> 06:49.100
where you kiss your girlfriend
for the first time.

06:49.100 --> 06:50.500
Am I wrong for doing that?

06:50.500 --> 06:51.900
No, not necessarily...

06:51.900 --> 06:54.900
not if you're planning it because 
you want it to be special or romantic.

06:54.900 --> 06:57.200
A nice romantic moment executed 
in the right way  

06:57.200 --> 06:59.100
might make up for your lack of experience.

06:59.700 --> 07:01.700
Remember, she has experience.

07:01.700 --> 07:04.800
Of some sort, but we
don't really know.Or care.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.500
You care, or you wouldn't
be going to all this trouble.

07:07.500 --> 07:09.800
Here's the deal.You can't plan
something this big by yourself,

07:09.800 --> 07:11.900
so I'll help you, as a favor.

07:13.700 --> 07:14.400
What?

07:15.600 --> 07:17.900
Like you're so romantic that you 
should plan his first kiss

07:17.900 --> 07:19.000
with a girl he's in love with?

07:20.000 --> 07:20.800
Yes.

07:27.400 --> 07:28.900
Hey, I'll walk you out.

07:29.600 --> 07:30.700
My dad's picking me up.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.000
What, he can't see us talking?

07:32.300 --> 07:34.000
He's thinking about it, OK?

07:34.400 --> 07:36.400
He might be giving in, but I don't know.

07:36.700 --> 07:40.200
How old do you think you'll be when you
stop letting your parents make your decisions?

07:40.200 --> 07:42.900
Huh? You're almost 16.

07:42.900 --> 07:45.200
Don't you think you should be able to 
decide who you can and cannot date?

07:45.200 --> 07:46.700
Jack, don't start this now.

07:46.700 --> 07:47.900
He's gonna be here any minute.

07:47.900 --> 07:50.300
Start what? 
I've been waiting a whole week.

07:50.300 --> 07:52.800
I know that.
It's not like I committed a crime.

07:53.400 --> 07:56.500
I made a small mistake with a girl
who means nothing to me.

07:56.500 --> 08:00.100
You know my family.Your small
mistake was a big deal to them.

08:00.100 --> 08:04.100
Now they're questioning your character,
your morals and my self-esteem.

08:04.100 --> 08:05.800
It was just a kiss. Jeez.

08:05.800 --> 08:09.500
Yeah, it was, a big wet kiss 
in front of the whole school

08:09.500 --> 08:10.800
when you were supposed
to be my boyfriend.

08:10.800 --> 08:14.600
I wanna be your boyfriend,
but I've waited all this time,

08:14.600 --> 08:16.200
and it's not like I can wait forever.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.700
I probably could wait forever,

08:18.700 --> 08:21.000
but what's the point if I'm not
gonna be seeing you anyway?

08:21.000 --> 08:22.400
All the guys think I'm a big wuss.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.900
They think you're in charge of me,
you and your parents.

08:25.500 --> 08:27.900
Well, I wouldn't want the guys to
think you're a big wuss.

08:28.700 --> 08:31.600
I'll try to get a decisiont
out of them tonight, OK?

08:31.600 --> 08:34.600
- Promise.
- Thank you. I miss you.

08:35.200 --> 08:36.100
Me too.

08:36.500 --> 08:37.600
All right,I'll talk to you soon.

08:44.400 --> 08:46.500
Oh, thought I heard someone.

08:46.600 --> 08:47.500
Adrian, right?

08:48.900 --> 08:49.800
Right.

08:50.100 --> 08:51.100
Marc, right?

08:51.100 --> 08:53.500
Marc Molina,the counselor?

08:53.500 --> 08:54.200
I know that.

08:55.200 --> 08:57.000
Funny I should run into you today.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.400
I had your file out, noticed you 
took your PSATs as a freshman.

09:01.400 --> 09:04.500
You did really well.
You're very smart.

09:04.500 --> 09:06.700
And your report card 
last year looks good, too.

09:06.700 --> 09:09.400
All A's and only one "B" last year?

09:09.400 --> 09:11.900
Yeah, well, don't go
spreading that around.

09:11.900 --> 09:13.600
It might ruin my reputation.

09:14.600 --> 09:15.900
Any plans for college?

09:16.300 --> 09:21.700
Maybe. I hear Indiana University
has an awesome sex education program.

09:22.300 --> 09:23.600
Awesome, huh?

09:24.400 --> 09:28.400
I saw that you almost got a perfect
scoreon the verbal side of your PSAT.

09:29.100 --> 09:31.600
Columbia's got a great English Lit department.

09:32.200 --> 09:33.900
I bet you'd really love New York.

09:34.400 --> 09:36.400
I really love sex.

09:38.700 --> 09:42.700
If you have any academic concerns,
stop by the office.

09:43.500 --> 09:47.500
I'd be happy to help you explore 
some options to your...current interest.

09:53.600 --> 09:56.000
So what, do you proposition
every guy you talk to?

09:56.200 --> 09:57.900
I saw you standing there.

10:11.300 --> 10:11.800
Hello.

10:12.800 --> 10:14.800
Hey, I'm not your chauffeur.
Sit up front.

10:14.800 --> 10:16.700
I believe you are our chauffeur.

10:17.600 --> 10:18.400
Seat belts?

10:18.400 --> 10:22.300
Sorry. I thought it would be OK if we put
them on when we're actually in motion.

10:22.500 --> 10:25.100
So, did, um, Amy tell her parents yet?

10:25.100 --> 10:26.300
You told him?

10:27.600 --> 10:29.100
You better not tell anyone, Jason.

10:29.100 --> 10:31.700
I don't know anyone who would care,
and you two couldn't keep a secret

10:31.700 --> 10:33.100
if your lives depended on it.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.200
You shouldn't have told him.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.600
It's not like Amy can keep hiding it.

10:36.600 --> 10:39.300
Her body's gonna change,
and she really should eat right

10:39.300 --> 10:41.900
and take prenatal vitamins and 
stuff to protect the fetus.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.000
Ew.

10:44.000 --> 10:44.600
What?

10:44.600 --> 10:48.100
Don't say things like "fetus" to us.

10:48.100 --> 10:51.700
I can't say fetus, but you can ask me
to take you on a free tampon run?

10:53.400 --> 10:56.300
You know Mom and Dad aren't gonna 
let you hang out with her anymore

10:56.300 --> 10:57.200
when they find out.

10:57.200 --> 10:58.800
They're not going to find out.

10:58.800 --> 11:01.600
Even if they did,
I didn't do anything wrong.

11:01.600 --> 11:03.900
I've been the one encouraging her
to tell her parents.

11:03.900 --> 11:06.900
Still, she had sex,
and no one your age should have sex,

11:06.900 --> 11:08.800
and no one your age should be having a baby.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.700
Mom and Dad definitely aren't gonna 
let you be friends with Amy Juergens,

11:11.700 --> 11:14.600
who had sex with some deviant
and is now having a baby.

11:14.600 --> 11:16.100
I don't think my dad will care.

11:17.700 --> 11:18.200
Will he?

11:22.600 --> 11:24.200
OK, whatever happened to knocking?

11:24.200 --> 11:26.400
Dinner's ready.We're not
waiting on Dad.We're eating.

11:26.400 --> 11:27.800
Anything good?

11:28.000 --> 11:29.700
I don't know. Isn't it always good?

11:29.700 --> 11:31.200
Well, yeah, but what is it?

11:31.200 --> 11:32.400
Just hamburgers.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.700
Hamburgers? Great.

11:34.900 --> 11:37.100
Oh, just so you know, before
Mom brings it up at dinner,

11:37.100 --> 11:39.000
we ran into someone you know
at the gas station.

11:39.200 --> 11:40.100
So?

11:41.500 --> 11:43.600
Dr. Hightower, our pediatrician.

11:45.500 --> 11:46.900
She said we need to
come in for our checkups.

11:47.400 --> 11:51.400
Oh. Um, what did Mom say?

11:51.600 --> 11:53.800
That she'd call her,
but I'm not sure she will,

11:53.800 --> 11:56.900
because Dr. Hightower has
a new doctor in the office.

11:57.400 --> 11:58.500
Dr. Bowman.

11:59.500 --> 12:00.800
Grace Bowman's dad.

12:02.700 --> 12:04.700
Dad's ex-wife's husband.

12:04.900 --> 12:08.600
Uh, wait.Wife number one's husband?

12:08.600 --> 12:10.300
How long has he been working there?

12:10.300 --> 12:11.400
How should I know?

12:11.400 --> 12:12.600
Let's eat.

12:26.300 --> 12:28.800
Jack's a nice guy.
You know he's a nice guy.

12:28.800 --> 12:30.400
He's not a nice guy.

12:30.400 --> 12:32.200
Oh, no?
You don't think Jack is a nice guy?

12:32.200 --> 12:33.700
He made a mistake.

12:33.700 --> 12:35.300
He thought she was you.

12:35.300 --> 12:37.500
Tom, let's just hear Grace out.

12:37.500 --> 12:38.800
She's not making sense.

12:38.800 --> 12:41.500
No, sweetheart,
you're not making any sense.

12:41.500 --> 12:42.400
No.

12:42.400 --> 12:44.700
Sometimes liking someone
doesn't always make sense.

12:44.700 --> 12:46.000
It isn't always logical.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.300
Maybe I have no reason
to like this guy, but I do.

12:49.300 --> 12:50.500
We dated all summer,

12:50.500 --> 12:53.400
and he never gave me or you guys
any reason not to trust him.

12:53.400 --> 12:54.400
Oh, come on.

12:54.400 --> 12:56.300
Yeah, come on, Gracie.

12:56.300 --> 12:58.600
OK, come on, boys.Tom,
will you go get the ice cream, please?

12:58.600 --> 13:01.000
I vote no on dating Jack.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.700
OK. Marshall?

13:02.700 --> 13:05.100
Oh, no, no. There'll be no 
voting in this household.

13:05.100 --> 13:07.100
Your mother and I will decide 
what happens in this household.

13:07.100 --> 13:10.500
It's not a democracy, it's a kingdom.
my kingdom.

13:10.500 --> 13:12.400
Well, your mother and my kingdom.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.600
And we hereby decree that 
you should go get the ice cream.

13:14.600 --> 13:16.300
OK, Mr. King.

13:18.700 --> 13:20.400
I don't know why you guys
think this is so funny.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.200
I wanna date Jack. Please.

13:23.200 --> 13:25.900
Gracie, you keep asking
the same question.

13:25.900 --> 13:27.900
The answer is the same. No.

13:27.900 --> 13:29.300
It's very simple. What's the answer?

13:29.300 --> 13:30.200
No, honey.

13:30.200 --> 13:30.900
No.

13:31.200 --> 13:31.700
See?

13:31.700 --> 13:33.100
I don't understand why.

13:33.100 --> 13:34.100
No, I think you do.

13:34.100 --> 13:36.600
I've heard what you have to say,
over and over and over again.

13:36.600 --> 13:39.400
I've taken it all into consideration, 
and what you need to do -

13:39.400 --> 13:40.800
you need to drop it.

13:40.800 --> 13:43.900
You need to drop him,
and you need to find somebody else.

13:46.600 --> 13:48.200
That's how the king works.

14:08.500 --> 14:09.200
Hello?

14:09.200 --> 14:10.300
Hello, Amy.

14:10.300 --> 14:11.400
It's Dr. Hightower.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.700
I just wanted to see how you were doing.

14:14.100 --> 14:14.900
Fine.

14:15.100 --> 14:16.200
How are you feeling?

14:16.900 --> 14:17.700
Fine.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.300
Any morning sickness?

14:20.000 --> 14:21.100
Nausea.

14:21.500 --> 14:23.500
Um, a little, yeah, sometimes.

14:23.500 --> 14:25.700
Try a few crackers by the bed.

14:25.700 --> 14:27.800
And eat a little something before you get up.

14:28.300 --> 14:29.300
OK.

14:29.800 --> 14:32.900
Your mother's a very nice woman.
She's gonna be a big help to you

14:32.900 --> 14:34.800
when she gets past the news.

14:37.300 --> 14:39.700
You haven't told her or your dad, have you?

14:41.200 --> 14:42.000
No.

14:43.900 --> 14:45.800
Come in.
Come in with her.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.800
Let's talk, the three of us.

14:47.800 --> 14:49.400
Let me help you with this.

14:49.400 --> 14:53.000
Every single day is important
in a pregnancy,Amy,

14:53.000 --> 14:56.500
and weeks have passed since I saw you.

14:57.100 --> 14:57.900
Amy?

14:58.000 --> 14:58.700
Yeah?

14:59.400 --> 15:01.600
You're in charge of another life now.

15:03.400 --> 15:04.800
Yeah, I know that.

15:16.800 --> 15:17.500
Hi, Ricky.

15:18.100 --> 15:18.900
Can I come over?

15:19.700 --> 15:20.700
Oh, wait. Hang on.

15:28.700 --> 15:30.300
I told you to call first.

15:31.500 --> 15:32.200
I did.

15:59.800 --> 16:01.700
Hey, it's Ricky.Leave a message.

16:02.600 --> 16:04.700
Ricky, Ken Fields here.

16:04.700 --> 16:06.200
You missed your appointment.

16:06.200 --> 16:09.300
In fact, you missed several appointments,
and that's really not good.

16:09.300 --> 16:12.200
It's not good for you,
because you need the help.

16:12.200 --> 16:14.900
It's not good for me,
because I need the money.

16:14.900 --> 16:18.900
So listen - I hate to threaten people,
but if that's what you'll respond to...

16:19.400 --> 16:22.000
I'm gonna call your mother, OK?

16:22.000 --> 16:24.500
So you get your ass in here, all right?

16:27.100 --> 16:27.700
Talk to ya.

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
Amy, did your dad mention to you 
anything that he had to do tonight?

16:40.500 --> 16:41.500
Unh-unh.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.500
Your feet are swollen.

16:45.600 --> 16:46.900
N- No, they're not.

16:47.700 --> 16:50.100
Honey, it's not a criticism,
but, yeah, they are.

16:50.800 --> 16:54.500
I think that Mr. Sedlack 
is working this band way too hard.

16:54.500 --> 16:58.300
I mean,the halftime shows are great,
but just so you know,

16:58.300 --> 17:00.200
if you don't wanna spend
all of your free time

17:00.200 --> 17:02.700
trying to form a snowflake with 
a bunch of intermediate musicians,

17:02.700 --> 17:06.300
your dad and I will understand,
and so will Juilliard.

17:06.300 --> 17:07.599
I like marching in a band.

17:08.700 --> 17:09.900
And we like seeing you march in a band.

17:09.900 --> 17:12.700
It's just... maybe those shoes
aren't good enough.

17:12.700 --> 17:15.099
Maybe you just need shoes
with more support.

17:15.099 --> 17:16.200
No, they have fine support.

17:16.200 --> 17:16.900
We just bought 'em.

17:16.900 --> 17:19.800
Still, I wanna take you
shoe shopping tomorrow.

17:19.800 --> 17:22.900
And maybe we'll get something extra,
now that you're dating and all.

17:22.900 --> 17:25.099
We just bought new clothes at
the beginning of the school year.

17:25.099 --> 17:27.700
Yeah, we bought school clothes,
not dating clothes.

17:27.700 --> 17:31.000
You know what?
I think you're getting curves.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.500
N- No, I-I don't think so.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.600
I'm sorry.
Did I embarrass you?

17:37.300 --> 17:38.800
You going out with Ben this weekend?

17:39.600 --> 17:40.300
Mm-hmm.

17:40.300 --> 17:41.500
Let's get something special.

17:41.500 --> 17:43.600
Mom, I really -

17:43.600 --> 17:45.200
I- I don't need anything.

17:45.200 --> 17:46.900
But this isn't about need.

17:46.900 --> 17:49.600
This is about me wanting
to buy my daughter something nice.

17:50.600 --> 17:52.900
Come on, it'll be fun.

17:53.600 --> 17:54.500
Can we take Ashley?

17:54.500 --> 17:55.400
Do we have to?

17:56.800 --> 17:58.800
It was a joke, Amy.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.300
I'm just joking.

18:00.300 --> 18:01.800
OK, we'll make it the three of us.

18:01.800 --> 18:02.600
OK.

18:03.200 --> 18:03.600
Good night.

18:04.000 --> 18:04.600
Night.

18:05.600 --> 18:06.100
I love you.

18:06.100 --> 18:07.100
Love you, too.

18:22.300 --> 18:25.200
At seven, you pick her up.
Do not put any food in the car.

18:25.200 --> 18:26.900
Why not? She loves to eat.

18:26.900 --> 18:28.200
The girl's got an appetite.

18:28.200 --> 18:31.300
Because you're taking her 
to the county fair.

18:32.100 --> 18:34.300
You'll have plenty of 
opportunity to get close.

18:34.300 --> 18:36.500
Just pick a ride, any ride,
but nothing that leaves the ground.

18:36.500 --> 18:38.800
Don't make her kiss you 
in a fearful moment.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.000
That's not romantic.

18:40.400 --> 18:44.000
Go for something dark with 
a tunnel and some water,

18:44.000 --> 18:45.100
like the riverboat ride.

18:45.100 --> 18:46.900
There are people hiding out at every turn. 

18:46.900 --> 18:49.000
It's creepy.
here are guys watching you.

18:49.300 --> 18:49.800
Ignore them.

18:49.800 --> 18:50.600
How?

18:50.600 --> 18:52.000
Focus on Amy.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.300
Focus on the kiss.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.300
How am I supposed to focus on the kiss

18:55.300 --> 18:57.700
when there's some guy lurking 
in the corner with a flashlight?

18:57.700 --> 18:59.600
Who cares about the guy
with the flashlight?

18:59.600 --> 19:02.400
I do.I don't want somebody
watching my big moment.

19:02.400 --> 19:03.800
It's only a big moment to you.

19:03.800 --> 19:06.800
Well, and hopefully for Amy.
We don't want an audience.

19:06.800 --> 19:09.500
What, like you wouldn't have
an audience on any other ride?

19:09.500 --> 19:11.700
Maybe I'll walk her over
to the livestock show.

19:11.700 --> 19:13.000
Where it smells like cow dung?

19:13.000 --> 19:14.300
The tunnels are too obvious.

19:14.300 --> 19:15.300
She'd see it coming.

19:15.600 --> 19:16.000
So what?

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
So I wanna appear to 
be more spontaneous than that.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.500
You're impossible.

19:21.900 --> 19:25.900
Can't you just say, "Great idea, Alice.
You're a genius when it comes to romance"?

19:25.900 --> 19:28.000
It was a good idea, the county fair.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.700
It's a great idea.
I don't know why you and Henry  

19:30.700 --> 19:32.800
don't think I know anything
when it comes to this stuff.

19:32.800 --> 19:34.100
I am a woman, you know.

19:34.700 --> 19:35.800
I know.

19:37.800 --> 19:38.800
Great idea.

19:40.800 --> 19:42.000
OK, the Ferris wheel.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.900
Mm, I'm afraid of heights,
and I'm a tad bit claustrophobic.

19:44.900 --> 19:48.000
Ooh, so it wasn't the strangers lurking 
in the corner with flashlights.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.200
I knew you were lying.

19:51.300 --> 19:53.600
Got it. Carousel.

19:53.600 --> 19:56.200
OK, but we can't really share a horse,

19:56.200 --> 19:58.200
so how does that work in terms of the kiss?

19:58.200 --> 19:59.400
There's always a bench.

19:59.400 --> 20:00.000
Go for the bench.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
Who sits on the bench?

20:01.100 --> 20:03.700
Guys who are afraid of heights
and are a tad bit claustrophobic.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.000
Do what I tell you.

20:06.300 --> 20:09.200
Great idea, Alice.
You're genius when it comes to romance.

20:13.300 --> 20:16.300
Poor Henry.
Poor, poor Henry.

20:16.700 --> 20:19.400
So? What's the final decision?
Where we goin'?

20:19.700 --> 20:22.200
Someplace where you can get out
and roam around on your own.

20:22.200 --> 20:23.000
The county fair.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.100
Ah, little privacy, huh?
You're gonna kiss her.

20:26.100 --> 20:28.100
Uh, it's not like
I haven't kissed her,

20:28.100 --> 20:30.600
but... yeah,
I'm gonna kiss her.

20:30.800 --> 20:31.600
It's about time.

20:31.600 --> 20:32.900
Ha. Yeah.

20:34.700 --> 20:36.700
You can't really rehearse
these things, you know?

20:36.700 --> 20:38.800
Don't worry so much.
Everything's gonna be fine.

20:38.800 --> 20:40.400
Once you kiss her,
it'll be like you been makin' out

20:40.400 --> 20:41.700
with chicks all your life.

20:41.700 --> 20:42.700
Really?

20:42.800 --> 20:44.400
You love this girl.
I can see it.

20:44.900 --> 20:47.300
I do,
and I think she loves me, too.

20:47.300 --> 20:49.500
So even if you bump noses
or something, from there,

20:49.500 --> 20:50.700
it'll just get better.

20:56.400 --> 20:57.600
I'm kidding!

21:01.100 --> 21:03.300
Why don't you just stay
a little while longer

21:03.300 --> 21:04.700
or however long you want?

21:06.600 --> 21:08.700
I know, I know,
you can't.

21:10.000 --> 21:10.800
Good night.

21:11.300 --> 21:11.900
Good night.

21:26.700 --> 21:27.700
Good night.

21:27.900 --> 21:28.600
Good night.

21:44.500 --> 21:45.500
Hello?

21:45.500 --> 21:46.400
Grace?

21:46.400 --> 21:47.600
Yeah. Who is this?

21:47.800 --> 21:49.500
This is Ricky Underwood.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.200
Oh, sure.
Adrian's boyfriend.

21:52.200 --> 21:55.100
Adrian's a friend.
I have a lot of friends.

21:55.100 --> 21:57.100
Thought maybe you and I
could even be friends,

21:57.100 --> 22:00.400
so, I just wanted to,you know,
clear the air with this whole thing.

22:00.400 --> 22:03.100
I feel like you're kind of avoiding me
in the hallway at school,

22:03.100 --> 22:05.400
and I don't want any weirdness
with anyone.

22:05.400 --> 22:08.700
Have I been avoiding you?
I'm so sorry.

22:08.700 --> 22:11.500
Thanks for saying that,
'cause you kinda hurt my feelings.

22:11.500 --> 22:12.900
I had no idea.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.900
I guess I've just been
so upset about Adrian

22:15.900 --> 22:17.400
and how she kissed Jack.

22:17.900 --> 22:18.600
Kissed?

22:18.600 --> 22:20.400
Yeah, right in front of everyone.

22:20.400 --> 22:23.500
Oh, yeah, that kiss.
That was forever ago.

22:23.500 --> 22:24.600
Don't worry about it.

22:24.800 --> 22:26.600
She was just trying
to make me jealous.

22:26.600 --> 22:30.400
She wants to be more than friends,but
I don't really wanna be more than that.

22:30.400 --> 22:32.700
Maybe she just hates me
for some reason.

22:33.300 --> 22:35.600
Maybe she just wants to break us up,
Jack and me.

22:35.600 --> 22:37.800
I don't think so, no.

22:38.200 --> 22:40.000
She was just usin' him to get to me.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
No offense, Grace
but not everything is about you.

22:43.300 --> 22:45.400
Oh, no offense taken.

22:45.800 --> 22:46.500
And you're right,

22:47.600 --> 22:48.900
not everything is about me.

22:48.900 --> 22:52.000
I'm just making this about me because,
I don't know, I guess

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
I'm just jealous because
she's so sexy, and I'm not.

22:55.800 --> 22:58.000
I'm just that good old girl next door.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.800
Is that what you think,
that you're not sexy?

23:01.500 --> 23:05.100
I got news for you.
Guys think you're sexy.

23:05.100 --> 23:06.300
I doubt it.

23:06.700 --> 23:07.700
I don't.

23:07.700 --> 23:10.600
Well, it doesn't matter
what other guys think.

23:10.900 --> 23:13.200
The only guy I wanna
go out with is Jack.

23:13.200 --> 23:14.500
Then go out with him.

23:14.500 --> 23:16.900
I told you, I can't.
My parents won't let me.

23:17.300 --> 23:19.600
They gave me
their final decision tonight.

23:19.600 --> 23:23.000
Grace, you don't have to do
everything your parents tell you to do,

23:23.000 --> 23:24.600
especially if you don't think
it's fair.

23:24.600 --> 23:27.000
I don't think it's fair,
but they're my parents.

23:27.000 --> 23:30.400
I mean I have to do what they tell me.
Don't you do what your parents tell you?

23:30.400 --> 23:31.300
Hell, no.

23:32.100 --> 23:33.300
Ricky...

23:33.300 --> 23:35.000
Would your parents
let you go out with me?

23:35.400 --> 23:38.300
I don't know.
It's not that you're not a nice guy.

23:38.300 --> 23:40.800
They just don't know you.
Besides, people might think

23:40.800 --> 23:43.100
I was going out with you
to make Adrian jealous,

23:43.100 --> 23:45.900
and it wouldn't be fair to you
because I really do think

23:45.900 --> 23:47.400
I'm in love with Jack.

23:47.400 --> 23:50.800
That was a very nice rejection speech,
but don't worry.

23:50.800 --> 23:53.200
I wasn't asking you out on a date.

23:53.200 --> 23:56.100
Oh. OK, well,
that's embarrassing.

23:56.700 --> 23:59.400
Yeah. I was offering to let you
pretend to date me.

23:59.400 --> 24:02.500
I'll pick you up and take you home,
but you and Jack can have any time

24:02.500 --> 24:03.800
in between that.

24:03.800 --> 24:05.100
You mean sneak around?

24:05.200 --> 24:06.300
Come on, Grace.

24:06.300 --> 24:08.400
Stop being the Jesus freak
people think you are

24:08.400 --> 24:10.100
and be normal for once.

24:10.600 --> 24:12.400
Be one of us.
It's not that big a deal.

24:12.400 --> 24:13.600
It'll be fun.

24:16.800 --> 24:17.500
No.

24:17.500 --> 24:18.800
I wasn't asking you, sweetie.

24:18.800 --> 24:20.200
I was telling you.

24:20.200 --> 24:22.000
I'm gonna go pick her up
after the game.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.800
I'll take her to meet Jack,
I'll come over your house,

24:24.800 --> 24:26.900
and then I'll go pick her up
and take her home.

24:27.300 --> 24:29.800
So you said.
No.

24:30.600 --> 24:33.000
You had sex with her boyfriend,
he cheated on her,

24:33.000 --> 24:34.200
and you cheated on me.

24:34.500 --> 24:38.100
It doesn't count as cheating.
You and I hadn't done anything then.

24:38.100 --> 24:39.800
I'm just giving Grace a ride.

24:41.100 --> 24:43.300
She's just doing this
to get back at me.

24:43.300 --> 24:46.100
She's not doing anything.
She asked me to help her.

24:46.100 --> 24:47.600
She's in love with Jack.

24:48.100 --> 24:50.200
You don't me to help get
the two of them together?

24:51.900 --> 24:53.200
You have some interest in Jack?

24:53.200 --> 24:55.500
I told you he's not my type.

24:55.500 --> 24:58.000
If you'd thought about it before
you did whatever you did with him,

24:58.000 --> 24:59.500
then we wouldn't be having
this problem,

24:59.500 --> 25:02.000
because he and Grace
wouldn't be having a problem.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.100
What is your interest
in helping these two idiots

25:04.100 --> 25:05.400
sneak around with each other?

25:05.400 --> 25:07.500
I don't know. She asked me.

25:10.300 --> 25:11.800
You're jealous of Grace Bowman?

25:12.500 --> 25:14.300
She's hardly my type.

25:14.300 --> 25:18.100
And when did type ever matter to you?
You like them all.

25:18.700 --> 25:20.300
Oh, and I'm different from you how?

25:20.300 --> 25:22.600
I am not jealous of some
prissy little virgin who thinks

25:22.600 --> 25:24.100
she's better than everyone else.

25:24.100 --> 25:27.600
You know what?
Go do whatever you want.

25:27.600 --> 25:30.200
After all,
we really aren't even friends.

25:30.200 --> 25:32.300
We're just bed buddies.

25:39.900 --> 25:41.900
So you'd be willing to sneak around
and hang out with me

25:41.900 --> 25:43.000
without your parents' permission?

25:43.300 --> 25:44.600
I tried everything.

25:44.600 --> 25:46.300
I think they're being
totally unreasonable,

25:46.300 --> 25:47.700
and they're treating me
like I'm a baby.

25:49.000 --> 25:49.900
You think we should?

25:49.900 --> 25:50.600
Yes.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.100
Yes, I think we should.

25:52.600 --> 25:55.200
I don't understand why Ricky
would volunteer to help us out.

25:55.700 --> 25:58.300
I don't know.
Because he and I are friends?

25:58.300 --> 25:59.700
Believe me,
that guy's not just interested

25:59.700 --> 26:00.700
in being your friend.

26:00.700 --> 26:02.000
Come on, yes, he is.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.100
No, he's not.

26:03.100 --> 26:04.800
He just wants to be alone
with you in the car.

26:04.800 --> 26:06.000
That's not true.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.800
Besides, what're our other options?

26:07.800 --> 26:09.600
I don't know.
Can't you just walk out of your house

26:09.600 --> 26:10.900
and tell your parents
you're gonna hang out with

26:10.900 --> 26:13.400
one of your friends,
one of your girl friends?

26:13.400 --> 26:14.600
I don't have any friends.

26:15.700 --> 26:17.500
Oh, hey, star-crossed lovers.

26:18.200 --> 26:19.600
Are we gonna do this or not?

26:22.400 --> 26:23.400
I guess.

26:23.900 --> 26:26.300
Mm.
So, where do you two wanna go?

26:27.700 --> 26:28.600
The county fair?

26:28.600 --> 26:30.600
Yeah.
And my dad doesn't really like rides,

26:30.600 --> 26:33.200
so he was gonna drop us off
and come back for us.

26:33.200 --> 26:35.400
Yeah, I'm not big on rides, either.

26:35.500 --> 26:38.100
No? I thought you said
you were one time.

26:38.100 --> 26:39.900
No. No, not really.

26:39.900 --> 26:41.900
Well, we can just walk around.

26:42.100 --> 26:46.000
They've got plenty of food there.
They've got corn dogs, hotdogs,

26:46.000 --> 26:49.100
and sausage and peppers
and onions and churros

26:49.100 --> 26:52.100
and cotton candy and frozen banas
dipped in chocolate.

26:52.100 --> 26:54.300
OK.
You had me at "corn dogs."

26:55.300 --> 26:56.000
Sorry.

26:57.900 --> 26:58.500
Hello.

26:58.700 --> 26:59.300
Amy?

26:59.700 --> 27:00.200
Yeah.

27:00.500 --> 27:01.600
Dr. Hightower.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.200
I haven't heard from you.

27:04.400 --> 27:07.300
Um... not now.

27:09.900 --> 27:11.200
Sorry, it's my mother.

27:13.500 --> 27:15.800
Um, I mean, m- mm-my sister.

27:16.300 --> 27:17.700
I'll call her back later.

27:18.200 --> 27:19.300
Fair sounds great.

27:28.800 --> 27:29.500
Where were you been?

27:29.500 --> 27:30.100
Shopping.

27:31.400 --> 27:32.800
Quite a haul.
What you got in there?

27:33.400 --> 27:35.500
Look who's taking an interest
in his family.

27:35.500 --> 27:36.100
What?

27:37.600 --> 27:38.300
Nothing.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.100
What time's dinner?

27:40.100 --> 27:41.500
Whatever time you go pick it up.

27:43.300 --> 27:44.100
What's going on?

27:44.300 --> 27:45.200
Got me.

27:48.600 --> 27:49.700
Well, we ate at the mall.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.200
Ashley and I did, anyway.

27:51.200 --> 27:52.200
Not Ames?

27:52.600 --> 27:53.800
No. She has a date.

27:53.800 --> 27:55.100
She wants to wait and eat with Ben.

27:57.200 --> 28:00.200
All right, well,
guess I'm going to pick up food.

28:00.400 --> 28:01.200
Will you be back?

28:02.200 --> 28:04.300
Yeah, I'll be back,
when I'm ready.

28:07.200 --> 28:08.500
I could go with you,
if you want.

28:08.800 --> 28:09.900
I'd like that, princess.

28:11.700 --> 28:12.800
You wanna come with us?

28:12.800 --> 28:15.000
We ate already.
And Amy has a date.

28:15.000 --> 28:18.100
So, what, you leave the Sausage Prince
is gonna take advantage of her?

28:18.500 --> 28:19.600
Let's go. She'll be fine.

28:21.300 --> 28:22.200
OK.

28:22.600 --> 28:24.000
Why don't you go tell
your sister we're leaving?

28:28.300 --> 28:29.200
What's going on?

28:29.200 --> 28:30.200
You tell me.

28:46.900 --> 28:48.400
When did you get boobs?

28:48.400 --> 28:49.900
Gained a little bit
of weight, OK?

28:50.900 --> 28:51.700
OK.

28:53.500 --> 28:54.700
Could you stop staring at me?

28:54.700 --> 28:58.400
Well, y-you look kinda...

28:58.400 --> 28:59.600
I look what?

28:59.900 --> 29:01.200
You look kinda sexy.

29:01.200 --> 29:02.700
I do not.

29:04.600 --> 29:06.800
Mom, Dad, and I are gonna
get something to eat, OK?

29:06.800 --> 29:07.600
But you just ate.

29:07.900 --> 29:08.700
So did she.

29:12.200 --> 29:13.000
Bye.

29:13.400 --> 29:14.200
Bye.

29:25.700 --> 29:27.800
Mom, Dad,
this is my friend Ricky.

29:28.200 --> 29:29.200
He's in the band.

29:29.200 --> 29:32.100
Band. Oh, hi, Ricky.
Nice to meet you.

29:33.400 --> 29:33.900
The drummer?

29:33.900 --> 29:35.200
Yeah, he plays the drums.

29:35.300 --> 29:36.100
You like drums?

29:36.100 --> 29:36.900
No.

29:40.200 --> 29:41.200
Where's Jack?

29:41.200 --> 29:44.300
I'm not allowed to see Jack anymore,
partly because of you.

29:45.200 --> 29:47.300
And why would you want to?
He kissed my girlfriend.

29:50.700 --> 29:53.000
We're gonna go to the fair.
We'll be back at ten, OK?

29:53.000 --> 29:53.800
Hang on.

29:54.400 --> 29:55.700
Fair's kinda rough,
don't you think?

29:56.600 --> 29:59.400
My foster mother's a social worker.
We have a lot of foster children

29:59.400 --> 30:00.300
in the house.

30:00.300 --> 30:02.100
Some cop gave us a bunch
of free tickets.

30:02.100 --> 30:04.200
He's gonna be there,
he and a bunch of other cops.

30:06.400 --> 30:07.800
So maybe it is a little rough.

30:07.800 --> 30:09.300
Yeah, maybe it is a little rough.

30:09.400 --> 30:11.000
Maybe we should hang out here.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.700
It's a good idea.
You can hang out here with us,

30:12.700 --> 30:13.700
play "Scruples."

30:14.400 --> 30:17.300
No. The fair can't be that bad.
It sounds like fun.

30:17.300 --> 30:18.400
We used to go every year.

30:18.800 --> 30:20.500
I could go with them.

30:21.100 --> 30:22.700
We're just friends.
We're just going to the fair.

30:22.700 --> 30:25.200
It's no big deal.
I mean, kids go to the fair all the time.

30:26.000 --> 30:26.600
Ahem.

30:26.600 --> 30:28.400
Say no, Mr. King.

30:28.800 --> 30:29.700
Mom...

30:32.300 --> 30:34.500
Tommy, I think we lost this fight.

30:35.700 --> 30:38.100
OK, you can go,
but I want you back

30:38.100 --> 30:40.200
at 9:57 sharp.

30:41.300 --> 30:42.700
And no kissing.

30:42.800 --> 30:44.400
No kissing.
We're just friends.

30:44.400 --> 30:44.700
Yeah, no kissing.

30:44.700 --> 30:45.600
Good night.

30:45.600 --> 30:46.300
Nice meeting you.

30:46.300 --> 30:48.200
Nice meeting you, too.

30:48.700 --> 30:52.400
Hey, drummer boy,I just happen to
know all the cops in town,

30:52.400 --> 30:53.500
in case you were wondering.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
No, he doesn't.
Let's go.

30:58.700 --> 31:00.800
I am feeling 
very uneasy about this.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.100
Ah, don't worry, sweetheart.

31:03.800 --> 31:05.800
They're only going out together
so she can mess with Jack

31:05.800 --> 31:07.500
and he can mess with, um...

31:07.600 --> 31:08.100
Adrian.

31:08.100 --> 31:09.200
Adrian, right.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.200
As far as I'm concerned,
if it annoys Jack,

31:11.200 --> 31:12.900
then it's OK with the King.

31:13.200 --> 31:14.800
Oh, OK.

31:14.900 --> 31:15.500
Yes.

31:15.500 --> 31:16.200
The King.

31:16.800 --> 31:17.400
Thank you.

31:17.400 --> 31:18.300
Mm-hmm.

31:19.000 --> 31:19.700
Wow,

31:21.000 --> 31:24.900
you look seriously,
uh, woman.

31:25.700 --> 31:26.600
Thank you.

31:27.100 --> 31:28.600
My mom made me go shopping.

31:29.100 --> 31:30.500
I mean,
you're always beautiful,

31:30.500 --> 31:33.200
but you look
especially beautiful tonight.

31:35.300 --> 31:38.300
I'm gonna grab my jacket,
just in case I need it.

31:39.700 --> 31:40.700
I hope you don't need it.

31:45.200 --> 31:47.900
Yeah. Yeah, you better
go get it, just in case.

31:53.700 --> 31:55.200
Please don't let me
screw this up.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.700
So, uh,`
how's the date shake?

32:05.500 --> 32:07.300
Interesting. I like it.

32:07.600 --> 32:09.100
So what's your favorite thing
you've eaten so far?

32:09.100 --> 32:10.500
I don't know.

32:10.500 --> 32:13.000
Oh, maybe that sausage thing
with the peppers and onions.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.400
That was really good.

32:14.700 --> 32:15.500
Told you so.

32:24.500 --> 32:26.500
We've gotta get boyfriends.

32:27.400 --> 32:30.100
You said it.
After this, let's find my brother

32:30.100 --> 32:31.100
and go home.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.500
I love the dog.

32:37.900 --> 32:38.400
Good.

32:38.600 --> 32:40.500
It must've cost you,
like, 50 bucks.

32:40.500 --> 32:42.000
Fortunately,
I had 50 bucks

32:42.000 --> 32:43.600
because I hadn't been out
with you in weeks.

32:44.300 --> 32:45.600
We're out now.

32:45.600 --> 32:47.800
Yeah, but I wish we didn't
have to sneak around, you know?

32:48.000 --> 32:49.100
I know, me too.

32:50.300 --> 32:51.600
I don't know,
it's kinda fun.

32:52.300 --> 32:54.300
I've never done anything bad before.

32:54.600 --> 32:56.400
Maybe you'd like to do
other bad things.

32:56.500 --> 32:57.700
Maybe I would.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.700
Should we go out to the car
and wait for Ricky?

33:05.700 --> 33:07.200
Is there more of this involved?

33:07.400 --> 33:08.200
Maybe.

33:08.400 --> 33:10.000
Definitely. Come on.

33:21.400 --> 33:22.700
You want something to eat?

33:22.700 --> 33:23.800
No, thanks.

33:24.800 --> 33:26.600
You can come with me,
if you want.

33:27.100 --> 33:28.400
To pick up Grace?

33:28.400 --> 33:29.200
Yeah.

33:29.600 --> 33:31.200
Uh, no, thanks.

33:31.300 --> 33:32.700
All right, your choice.

33:33.600 --> 33:34.900
Call me after you drop her off.

33:37.900 --> 33:38.900
I'll try.

33:39.500 --> 33:40.400
You'll try?

33:40.900 --> 33:42.500
Mm, not a phone guy.

33:42.700 --> 33:45.900
OK, then drop her off
and come back over here.

33:46.300 --> 33:47.400
I can't do that.

33:47.600 --> 33:49.800
You could if you wanted to.

33:50.100 --> 33:52.100
No, I couldn't.

33:56.600 --> 33:58.600
That was great.
I had a really good time.

33:59.100 --> 34:02.300
Well, we could have a good time
all night long.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.300
I can't sleep over.

34:08.000 --> 34:08.699
Bye.

34:10.400 --> 34:11.699
Go pick up your girlfriend.

34:36.100 --> 34:38.500
Riding this the second time
was not such a great idea.

34:39.100 --> 34:42.000
No, this is great.
I love the benches.

34:42.400 --> 34:43.900
Anyone can just
sit on the horses.

35:00.500 --> 35:01.300
How was it?

35:01.900 --> 35:03.200
Ooh, you scared me.

35:04.100 --> 35:05.200
What's that smell?

35:06.000 --> 35:07.300
Got sick on the carousel.

35:08.700 --> 35:09.700
What did you eat?

35:11.500 --> 35:12.500
Everything.

35:13.400 --> 35:16.400
You rode home in the car with
Ben and the Sausage King like that?

35:16.700 --> 35:19.700
I had to.
I went to the bathroom and washed up,

35:20.600 --> 35:22.000
chewed a piece of gum,
but there was only

35:22.000 --> 35:23.200
so much I could do.

35:25.300 --> 35:26.700
What? I couldn't help it.

35:28.200 --> 35:29.200
Where's Mom and Dad?

35:29.800 --> 35:31.600
They went to bed,
but I think they're fighting.

35:32.000 --> 35:32.700
About what?

35:33.600 --> 35:34.200
I don't know.

35:34.700 --> 35:38.600
She seems mad at him about something,
but they don't tell me that stuff.

35:41.200 --> 35:42.300
Would you go change?

35:43.100 --> 35:44.300
You kinda stink.

35:45.100 --> 35:47.000
Yes, I know. Good night.

35:49.700 --> 35:50.300
Wait.

35:55.300 --> 35:57.700
I stayed up because
I wanted to ask you something.

36:00.600 --> 36:04.100
You're not, like, pregnant
or anything, are you?

36:04.700 --> 36:06.900
W- Why would you
say something like that?

36:06.900 --> 36:08.800
Amy, you're acting
really weird lately,

36:08.800 --> 36:11.500
and you're stuttering again, so know
you're trying to cover something up.

36:11.800 --> 36:14.800
You're lying all the time,
and you're hungry all the time.

36:14.800 --> 36:18.800
You eat everything in sight,
and you've gained weight.

36:18.800 --> 36:20.400
You've got boobs.

36:21.600 --> 36:24.700
And you got sick.
You love the carousel.

36:28.300 --> 36:29.000
So?

36:32.100 --> 36:36.000
I won't tell them if you are.
I won't tell anyone,I promise.

36:36.800 --> 36:38.200
You're gonna need me if you are,

36:38.600 --> 36:40.200
because you know
they're gonna kill you and...

36:41.800 --> 36:43.000
you're gonna need a friend.

36:43.400 --> 36:45.000
I have friends, Ashley.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.100
Not in this house,
not if you're having a baby.

36:47.500 --> 36:48.700
Just tell me, are you?

36:50.200 --> 36:51.400
Are you having a baby?

36:54.700 --> 36:58.700
Yeah.
Don't tell anyone,OK?

36:59.200 --> 37:00.600
I'll tell them when I need to.

37:22.900 --> 37:23.600
Hi, Dad.

37:23.800 --> 37:24.600
You're late.

37:24.600 --> 37:26.900
I called. I told Mom
we were getting something to eat.

37:27.300 --> 37:29.300
You were right about the fair.
It was a little rough.

37:29.300 --> 37:30.900
The food didn't look that safe.

37:30.900 --> 37:31.500
Really?

37:32.800 --> 37:34.600
So, where'd you two wind up eating?

37:34.600 --> 37:36.700
We ate where I told Mom
we were gonna eat

37:37.400 --> 37:38.200
Dairy Shack.

37:38.400 --> 37:39.900
Oh, that's right,
the Dairy Shack.

37:40.600 --> 37:44.500
I was just checking.
That's quite a prize.

37:45.400 --> 37:47.800
You win that dog for my daughter,
drummer boy?

37:47.800 --> 37:49.600
No, not me.
It was Grace.

37:50.400 --> 37:52.400
Fish-bowl toss.
She wanted something for Tom.

37:52.400 --> 37:55.700
Something like that must've set somebody
back at least a hundred bucks at the fair.

37:55.700 --> 37:57.700
No, not really.
More like 50.

37:59.900 --> 38:01.200
Oh, I'm gonna pay you back

38:01.500 --> 38:02.800
for everything you've spent.

38:03.900 --> 38:05.600
We split it.
It was no big deal.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Here.
I'll give you some money for it.

38:08.000 --> 38:08.900
Tom's really gonna love that.

38:08.900 --> 38:11.700
No, I couldn't accept that.
It's part of going to the fair.

38:12.200 --> 38:14.500
We had a really nice time.
I had a really nice time.

38:14.500 --> 38:15.500
Take it.

38:15.500 --> 38:17.700
All right, thank you.

38:18.700 --> 38:20.400
I had a really nice time, too.

38:20.400 --> 38:22.200
That's really nice of you,
Ricky.

38:23.700 --> 38:25.100
Really nice of you,
Gracie.

38:25.900 --> 38:28.400
I better be going.
I'll talk to you tomorrow?

38:28.400 --> 38:29.100
Mm-hmm.

38:29.200 --> 38:30.600
Good night, sir.

38:30.600 --> 38:31.400
Good night, Ricky.

38:31.900 --> 38:32.800
'Night.
Thanks for everything.

38:32.800 --> 38:33.600
YES,Sure.

38:39.400 --> 38:40.400
Fish toss, huh?

38:41.200 --> 38:41.800
Mm-hmm.

38:48.500 --> 38:53.100
Yeah. Something fishy's
going on around here.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.600
Oh, my God,
I think that's Ben.

39:07.100 --> 39:07.700
Hi.

39:08.100 --> 39:09.000
Hi.

39:09.700 --> 39:12.800
I, uh, I know
it's kinda late,

39:12.800 --> 39:14.400
but you forgot something.

39:16.700 --> 39:17.300
Hi.

39:18.000 --> 39:18.600
Bye.

39:23.100 --> 39:23.900
There you go.

39:25.200 --> 39:28.700
Oh, thank you, but
you probably should've thrown that away.

39:28.700 --> 39:31.600
I, uh, I rinsed it off.
I think it's OK.

39:32.400 --> 39:34.600
And I brought you
some ginger ale.

39:35.100 --> 39:37.700
Ginger settles the stomach,
my dad said.

39:39.100 --> 39:39.900
Thank you.

39:40.700 --> 39:41.500
And, um...

39:44.000 --> 39:45.200
I forgot something.

39:47.200 --> 39:48.600
I forgot to do this.

40:04.200 --> 40:05.300
Good night, Amy.

40:06.800 --> 40:07.900
Good night, Ben.

40:08.800 --> 40:11.400
Again,
I'm really sorry for everything.

40:11.900 --> 40:12.700
I'm not.

40:14.100 --> 40:15.700
I'm not sorry
that you kissed me.

40:19.400 --> 40:20.200
I love you.

40:23.800 --> 40:24.500
Me too.

40:45.700 --> 40:46.500
Does he know?

40:49.300 --> 40:49.900
No.
