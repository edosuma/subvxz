00:01.000 --> 00:04.234
<i>The 1970s were
an awesome time to be a kid.</i>

00:04.297 --> 00:06.179
<i>It was the Wild West.</i>

00:06.234 --> 00:08.402
<i>Bike helmets hadn't been
invented yet or car seatbelts</i>

00:08.436 --> 00:11.105
<i>or even normal adult supervision.</i>

00:11.139 --> 00:13.107
<i>Dads weren't around
as much as they are now.</i>

00:13.141 --> 00:15.109
<i>And my mom was busy running the house.</i>

00:15.143 --> 00:18.546
<i>She had a lot on her plate
and no time for tomfoolery...</i>

00:18.580 --> 00:19.547
<i>whatever that is.</i>

00:19.581 --> 00:21.148
<i>There were eight of us boys,</i>

00:21.182 --> 00:23.884
<i>including my oldest brother,
just home from college.</i>

00:23.919 --> 00:26.487
<i>That's a lot of testosterone
under one roof.</i>

00:32.350 --> 00:34.161
Timmy, wipe the crumbs off that
and bring it here.

00:34.195 --> 00:35.796
You think we're made of foil?

00:35.830 --> 00:36.764
Hey!

00:36.798 --> 00:38.354
I've got an important surprise
in the car.

00:38.409 --> 00:40.801
Who wants to help carry it in?
Eddie, Frank, you do.

00:40.835 --> 00:43.170
<i>Like dads since cavemen days...</i>

00:43.204 --> 00:44.972
- Oh, boy.
- <i>...mine loved the heroic feeling</i>

00:45.006 --> 00:47.271
<i>of bringing something home
intended to make life easier</i>

00:47.330 --> 00:48.263
<i>for his mate.</i>

00:48.287 --> 00:49.910
We are the proud recipients

00:49.945 --> 00:52.090
of our very own dielectric oven.

00:52.131 --> 00:55.033
It heats food using
small wavelength radiation.

00:55.067 --> 00:56.768
- Radiation?
- Micro-waves.

00:56.802 --> 00:58.202
- Over here on the counter.
- On the counter?

00:58.237 --> 00:59.270
Where am I supposed to put the baby

00:59.304 --> 01:00.359
when I'm chopping things?

01:00.375 --> 01:03.010
Right up here on top.
It's a prototype from the plant.

01:03.044 --> 01:04.678
Mr. Crane selected us
to be among the first families

01:04.712 --> 01:06.614
to try it out. Here you go, William.

01:06.648 --> 01:08.048
So we're guinea pigs.

01:08.083 --> 01:10.050
We're pioneers. Like Neil Armstrong.

01:10.085 --> 01:11.785
And just like the astronauts,

01:11.820 --> 01:13.153
we need to log our experiences.

01:13.188 --> 01:15.689
Plus any physical symptoms
that may arise.

01:15.714 --> 01:16.657
Symptoms?

01:16.691 --> 01:18.459
"Dizziness, wounds that won't heal,

01:18.493 --> 01:20.227
blurred vision, impotence,
hallucinations..."

01:20.261 --> 01:22.863
Thank you, but I don't think
I need this.

01:22.897 --> 01:24.328
It'll cut your cooking time in half.

01:24.392 --> 01:26.233
You had a chance to
cut my cooking time in half

01:26.267 --> 01:27.835
- four kids ago.
- You are gonna love it.

01:27.869 --> 01:28.969
Just don't put any metal in it.

01:29.004 --> 01:31.038
- I don't want to put anything in it.
- Why no metal?

01:31.072 --> 01:33.073
Well, the scientific
explanation's complicated,

01:33.108 --> 01:35.142
but the dad explanation is "shut up."

01:35.176 --> 01:37.144
This kind of technology
helps defend America.

01:37.178 --> 01:38.182
Then count me in.

01:38.207 --> 01:39.980
It'll cook a hot dog in 30 seconds.

01:40.015 --> 01:41.980
In a war, our boys will have eaten

01:42.012 --> 01:44.199
and launched their missiles while
the Soviets are still

01:44.238 --> 01:45.941
- boiling their dog water.
- Nice.

01:48.088 --> 01:49.422
That's unbelievable.

01:51.092 --> 01:53.172
I know. I know. I'll make myself scarce.

01:53.197 --> 01:55.829
It's okay. Come in. Close the door.

01:55.864 --> 01:58.565
<i>Joey was two years older,
and it was pretty huge</i>

01:58.600 --> 02:00.434
<i>being invited in
on some secret between him</i>

02:00.468 --> 02:02.536
<i>and his ultra-sophisticated
friend Davey.</i>

02:02.561 --> 02:05.764
Hello, Timothy.

02:07.366 --> 02:08.633
What's the skinny?

02:08.667 --> 02:10.001
You know Barbara Eden,

02:10.035 --> 02:11.993
- the genie from "I Dream of Jeannie"?
- Yeah.

02:12.025 --> 02:14.172
Well, Davey's cousin in Maine
called long distance

02:14.206 --> 02:16.207
to tell him to watch
a certain show she's on tonight.

02:16.242 --> 02:17.562
It's on three hours earlier back there

02:17.587 --> 02:19.677
'cause they're all
stupid farmers or something.

02:20.713 --> 02:23.047
Apparently, she's dancing,

02:23.082 --> 02:24.492
and in the middle of it her clothes rip

02:24.517 --> 02:29.154
or something because...
according to Davey's cousin...

02:29.188 --> 02:31.790
you can see everything.

02:34.026 --> 02:35.560
Everything?

02:35.594 --> 02:37.228
Everything.

02:38.998 --> 02:41.132
In the world?

02:43.269 --> 02:45.136
Okay, your brother doesn't
know jack about girls.

02:45.171 --> 02:46.838
I guess not. Let's go.

02:46.872 --> 02:50.241
<i>And just like that,
I was on the outside again.</i>

02:50.276 --> 02:52.243
<i>I didn't figure out
what they meant by "everything"</i>

02:52.278 --> 02:54.212
<i>until it was way too late.</i>

02:56.081 --> 02:58.049
Oh!

02:58.083 --> 03:00.852
Guys!

03:00.886 --> 03:02.253
This will free up all kinds of time

03:02.288 --> 03:03.121
to do the stuff you enjoy...

03:03.155 --> 03:05.056
laundry, sewing, cleaning the house.

03:05.090 --> 03:06.858
You'll be the envy of all your friends.

03:06.892 --> 03:08.226
I'm expected to get friends now, too?

03:08.260 --> 03:09.427
Watch what it does with an egg.

03:12.064 --> 03:13.398
Is that a microwave oven?

03:13.432 --> 03:15.600
See? The whole town's talking about it.

03:15.634 --> 03:16.601
Oh.

03:20.239 --> 03:22.173
Oh, Mike, I don't need this.

03:22.208 --> 03:23.241
I promise, if you don't like it
by tomorrow,

03:23.275 --> 03:25.677
you can keep trying.
Eventually, you'll like it.

03:25.711 --> 03:27.445
I didn't realize these were
approved for home use.

03:27.479 --> 03:29.681
They're not. They take up
too much counter space.

03:29.715 --> 03:30.615
Why is the egg shaking?

03:30.649 --> 03:33.351
It's excited
about innovative technology!

03:35.387 --> 03:36.554
Jiminy Christmas!

03:39.124 --> 03:40.291
Outstanding!

03:40.326 --> 03:42.694
Here.

03:42.728 --> 03:43.695
You clean up the egg stuff,

03:43.729 --> 03:45.463
then let's blow up an orange.

03:47.733 --> 03:50.268
Doesn't sound like
Dad's listening to you, Mom.

03:50.302 --> 03:51.436
You know you have a right to be heard.

03:51.470 --> 03:53.238
Look at you, sticking your nose in

03:53.272 --> 03:54.639
between me and your father.

03:54.673 --> 03:56.598
You aiming for a broken home
or a broken jaw?

03:56.623 --> 03:57.834
<i>When you said something to my mom</i>

03:57.866 --> 04:00.087
<i>that she didn't want to hear,
she tended to respond with hostility.</i>

04:00.112 --> 04:01.302
<i>The more hostility,</i>

04:01.327 --> 04:02.814
<i>the more you knew
you were onto something.</i>

04:02.848 --> 04:04.415
I've just been
reading some psychology and...

04:04.450 --> 04:05.917
Okay. I'll stop you right there.

04:05.951 --> 04:07.283
Your dad and I
don't have any psychology.

04:07.308 --> 04:10.488
We were raised in the Depression
and had to do without.

04:10.522 --> 04:12.657
I got this orange
from Mrs. Strausser's tree.

04:12.691 --> 04:15.293
It dropped on our side after
I beat the branch with a rake.

04:15.327 --> 04:17.095
- We also got a new Frisbee.
- Lawrence read a book

04:17.129 --> 04:19.096
and thinks he can
analyze our psychology.

04:19.130 --> 04:21.666
Oh, don't waste your time.
We're 100% normal.

04:21.700 --> 04:24.669
Now let's make this fruit ball go boom.

04:26.138 --> 04:28.106
I should really cut down on these.

04:28.140 --> 04:30.108
Mm, you know what? Try one of mine.

04:30.142 --> 04:32.277
- They're mild.
- Hmm.

04:32.311 --> 04:34.112
Chicago should be
getting their glimpse of Eden

04:34.146 --> 04:36.180
right about now.

04:36.215 --> 04:39.150
<i>Unlike nowadays when
every aspect of female anatomy</i>

04:39.184 --> 04:40.610
<i>is only a mouse-click away,</i>

04:40.635 --> 04:44.727
<i>in 1972 the level of ignorance
in a house with all boys</i>

04:44.752 --> 04:45.766
<i>was staggering.</i>

04:45.791 --> 04:47.158
I know what you guys were talking about.

04:47.192 --> 04:48.860
What show is Barbara Eden
gonna be on tonight?

04:48.894 --> 04:52.130
We can't let you in on this.
It might scar you.

04:52.164 --> 04:53.298
Well, I wanna be scarred.

04:53.332 --> 04:55.700
Tell me.

04:55.734 --> 04:57.869
"The Bob Hope Special," 9:00.

04:57.903 --> 05:00.305
And according to my cousin,
you can see it all.

05:00.339 --> 05:01.673
The whole kit and caboodle.

05:01.707 --> 05:03.174
Both?

05:05.210 --> 05:06.377
Obviously you don't know much,

05:06.412 --> 05:08.095
so let me teach you the basics.

05:08.120 --> 05:10.615
First off, girls' penises

05:10.649 --> 05:12.383
are totally different from ours...

05:15.530 --> 05:17.357
Food's ready!

05:17.444 --> 05:19.623
Possibly. No guarantees.

05:23.186 --> 05:24.920
Look at us!

05:24.972 --> 05:27.189
It's like dinnertime on Apollo 16.

05:27.262 --> 05:28.796
So far, this thing
hasn't saved me one minute.

05:28.831 --> 05:29.916
And every time I turn it on,

05:29.941 --> 05:31.966
the neighborhood dogs
circle the house and bark.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.235
Seriously?

05:35.671 --> 05:37.872
- That is valuable data.
- Yeah.

05:37.906 --> 05:41.542
William, make a note.
Dogs love the microwave.

05:41.577 --> 05:43.544
Get away from our house!

05:43.579 --> 05:45.112
Timmy and I call the TV for tonight.

05:45.147 --> 05:47.949
We got a show we want to watch.
It's... educational.

05:47.983 --> 05:49.917
Sorry, there's a program
I'm looking forward to.

05:49.952 --> 05:51.919
- Mom, no!
- "The Bob Hope Special" is on.

05:51.954 --> 05:52.854
Okay, your house, your rules.

05:52.888 --> 05:54.789
That man helped us win three wars.

05:54.823 --> 05:55.990
If it weren't for Bob, you'd be watching

05:56.024 --> 05:57.146
"The Ho Chi Minh Show" tonight.

05:57.201 --> 05:58.364
Peg, maybe tomorrow you can

05:58.420 --> 05:59.994
microwave that casserole thing you do,

06:00.028 --> 06:01.285
you know, with the tater-tots,

06:01.310 --> 06:02.630
chipped beef, and the French dressing...

06:02.664 --> 06:04.298
Give away my recipe, why don't you?

06:04.333 --> 06:05.733
No, tomorrow night, we're going to

06:05.767 --> 06:07.802
the Hawaiian Luau Dinner Dance
at the church.

06:07.836 --> 06:09.804
Sorry, Peg. That dinner thing's a no.

06:09.838 --> 06:11.606
I promised the boys I'd take
them to the Dodger game.

06:12.875 --> 06:13.608
It's Bat Night!

06:13.642 --> 06:15.443
I told you about this weeks ago.

06:15.477 --> 06:16.811
Was the TV on?

06:16.845 --> 06:19.447
'Cause if it was, that's on you.

06:19.481 --> 06:20.815
Yeah, well,
bring me a bat from Bat Night

06:20.849 --> 06:22.083
so I can get your attention.

06:22.117 --> 06:23.451
<i>My mom didn't socialize often</i>

06:23.485 --> 06:25.086
<i>because she didn't much like people,</i>

06:25.120 --> 06:26.687
<i>but the occasional dinner out
with my dad</i>

06:26.722 --> 06:28.489
<i>was something she looked forward to.</i>

06:28.524 --> 06:29.957
This pizza's like rubber.

06:29.992 --> 06:32.386
It's better this way.
Makes eating it last longer.

06:32.411 --> 06:33.694
Ow! I burnt my tongue.

06:33.729 --> 06:37.298
Yeah, mine's frozen solid.
Peggy, what did you do wrong?

06:37.332 --> 06:38.503
What I did wrong was let you

06:38.528 --> 06:40.434
bring that crazy food robot
into my home.

06:40.469 --> 06:41.836
All right, tonight after supper,

06:41.870 --> 06:43.471
William and I are gonna
roll up our sleeves

06:43.505 --> 06:45.273
and tackle this thing.

06:45.307 --> 06:47.708
Call your wife.
Tell her you might be home late.

06:49.144 --> 06:51.212
This fish stick is burning my tongue!

06:51.246 --> 06:54.215
Here. Ice it down with this.

06:54.249 --> 06:56.617
All right, William, cream of tomato soup

06:56.652 --> 06:59.887
at two minutes... warm and savory.

06:59.922 --> 07:04.292
Two minutes, four seconds...
Manson crime scene.

07:05.894 --> 07:07.161
"Manson crime scene."

07:08.997 --> 07:11.365
Everything all right
in my kitchen, Mike?

07:11.400 --> 07:13.067
Never better!

07:13.101 --> 07:16.230
<i>Welcome to the Bob
Hope Summer Extravaganza.</i>

07:18.840 --> 07:20.875
You boys seem awfully excited.

07:20.909 --> 07:22.910
It's an extravaganza.

07:22.945 --> 07:25.079
That means there's extra vaganza.

07:26.348 --> 07:27.715
Oh, is it cool if my friend Davey

07:27.749 --> 07:28.983
comes over and watches with us?

07:29.017 --> 07:30.251
Of course Davey's welcome.

07:30.285 --> 07:32.420
I know this is the time of night
his mother gets into her wine.

07:32.454 --> 07:33.554
And when that woman gets started...

07:33.579 --> 07:34.546
Hello, Davey!

07:34.571 --> 07:35.828
Hey. Hi, Mrs. Cleary.
Thanks for having me over.

07:35.853 --> 07:37.562
You mind if I watch this?
My mom's watching something else.

07:37.587 --> 07:39.035
- So she was awake when you left, then?
- Yes.

07:39.063 --> 07:40.018
That's encouraging.

07:40.043 --> 07:42.830
We fixed it so the neighborhood
dogs stop barking.

07:42.864 --> 07:43.831
Who's up for a baked potato?

07:43.865 --> 07:46.000
No one wants a baked potato
at 9:00 at night.

07:46.034 --> 07:47.201
This isn't Europe.

07:47.235 --> 07:49.036
A dessert potato?

07:49.071 --> 07:50.237
Take five minutes to think about it.

07:50.272 --> 07:51.872
The potatoes will be done in two!

07:51.907 --> 07:52.807
Let's light 'em up.

07:52.841 --> 07:55.176
The gang out there
is hollering for taters!

07:55.210 --> 07:56.473
Wow, you're really invested

07:56.497 --> 07:57.411
in that device, Dad.

07:57.412 --> 07:59.046
Oh, it's an honor.
I was the first employee

07:59.081 --> 08:01.248
Mr. Crane asked to test it
after Bob Brogan chickened out

08:01.283 --> 08:02.350
because of the metal plate in his head.

08:02.384 --> 08:05.586
Poor Bob Brogan. A plate
in his head and no microwave.

08:05.621 --> 08:06.587
Hmm.

08:06.622 --> 08:08.094
<i>I've heard of Off-Broadway,</i>

08:08.119 --> 08:10.124
<i>but this is ridiculous.</i>

08:10.158 --> 08:12.266
<i>One year you don't send
a Christmas card to your agent,</i>

08:12.291 --> 08:13.227
<i>look where he sends you.</i>

08:13.252 --> 08:14.508
If you boys really don't like this,

08:14.533 --> 08:16.030
I guess we can turn on something else.

08:16.055 --> 08:17.089
- Oh, no!
- No. No, we love it.

08:17.132 --> 08:18.799
It's... We're laughing on the inside.

08:18.834 --> 08:21.402
<i>It was quite a trip.
Eight hours for flight</i>

08:21.436 --> 08:22.803
<i>and two days to get your luggage.</i>

08:25.607 --> 08:27.408
- Luggage.
- Yeah.

08:27.442 --> 08:30.811
<i>We'll be right back.</i>

08:32.614 --> 08:34.782
I just mean that
your sense of selfworth is...

08:34.816 --> 08:36.317
is maybe tied to your work.

08:36.351 --> 08:38.219
What's tied to it is my paycheck.

08:38.253 --> 08:39.986
Well, it looks like Mr. Crane's regard

08:40.022 --> 08:41.822
- is really important to you.
- It's because he's my friend.

08:41.857 --> 08:44.158
And what does your friend
Mr. Crane call you?

08:44.192 --> 08:45.960
He calls me "Mike"...

08:45.994 --> 08:47.495
...'cause we're friends.

08:47.529 --> 08:49.330
Aah! Man overboard!

08:49.364 --> 08:50.731
We'll give that one to Davey.

08:50.766 --> 08:51.899
<i>Our next guest comes to us</i>

08:51.933 --> 08:53.901
<i>straight from inside her bottle.</i>

08:53.935 --> 08:55.403
Just like Davey's mom.

What's that?

09:32.365 --> 09:34.375
I tried to heat up some cobbler.

09:34.409 --> 09:36.210
You ruined my best Tupperware.

09:36.244 --> 09:37.945
No, it's an old margarine tub.

09:37.979 --> 09:40.881
Exactly, my best Tupperware.

09:40.916 --> 09:42.850
See what I mean
about the mess in there, Peg?

09:44.453 --> 09:47.321
<i>My mom always tried her
best to avoid arguing with my dad,</i>

09:47.355 --> 09:52.159
<i>but she had ways of
expressing herself nonverbally.</i>

09:53.495 --> 09:55.024
<i>Not the best approach</i>

09:55.048 --> 09:56.170
<i>to conflict resolution...</i>

09:56.195 --> 09:57.865
<i>...but better than her first choice...</i>

09:57.890 --> 10:00.192
<i>throwing it at his head.</i>

10:00.235 --> 10:02.236
W-Wait. W-W-What's happening?

10:02.270 --> 10:04.171
This happens sometimes.
Wiggle the antennae.

10:06.541 --> 10:08.476
Not up and down. Side to side.

10:08.510 --> 10:10.068
Is that better?
No, it's worse. That's worse.

10:10.093 --> 10:11.645
- Go back to where you were.
- What?!

10:11.680 --> 10:13.756
No, no. Davey, this way,
this way, this way.

10:13.781 --> 10:15.216
The microwave!

10:15.250 --> 10:16.984
Oh, no.

10:20.622 --> 10:22.590
No! Move it this way! Move it... Yeah!

10:22.624 --> 10:23.591
Yeah!

10:23.625 --> 10:25.059
- Yes!
- Yes!

10:30.465 --> 10:34.025
N-o-o-o-o-o!

10:35.657 --> 10:37.257
Oatmeal, Mike?

10:37.330 --> 10:39.087
Have to warn you,
it'll be 30 seconds longer

10:39.181 --> 10:40.665
since we don't have that thing anymore.

10:40.700 --> 10:44.469
It's interesting.
You know what I found in here?

10:44.503 --> 10:45.746
Something metal.

10:45.785 --> 10:47.597
- Something metal?
- How could that have happened?

10:47.637 --> 10:49.372
- I don't know.
- Hmm.

10:49.406 --> 10:50.339
But I have a theory.

10:50.374 --> 10:54.643
Me too. What's yours?
We'll see if they match.

10:54.678 --> 10:55.845
Has to be one of the kids.

10:55.879 --> 10:57.680
Bingo.

10:57.714 --> 10:58.948
Probably not Andy, though.

11:00.751 --> 11:03.352
Probably.

11:03.387 --> 11:05.154
Maybe there'll be a rerun?

11:05.188 --> 11:06.856
Not after grown-ups get wind of this.

11:06.890 --> 11:08.691
I heard the camera man got arrested.

11:08.725 --> 11:11.727
If only there was a way
to see something on TV again

11:11.762 --> 11:13.729
after it's already been on.

11:13.764 --> 11:16.165
That technology exists, gentlemen.

11:16.199 --> 11:17.566
My brother was watching
at his friend's last night,

11:17.601 --> 11:19.702
- and he took a picture.
- No way.

11:19.736 --> 11:20.738
Right at the moment of truth.

11:20.763 --> 11:21.939
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

11:21.964 --> 11:23.672
- Be cool.
- Sorry.

11:23.707 --> 11:25.708
Now, listen, if we rush
to the drug store right now,

11:25.742 --> 11:27.510
we get it back in no time. 10 days tops.

11:27.544 --> 11:29.078
No. We go to Fotomat.

11:29.112 --> 11:30.312
For a little extra bread,

11:30.347 --> 11:33.516
you get your pictures in 24 hours.

11:33.550 --> 11:34.550
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

11:34.584 --> 11:37.720
All Cleary boys to the living room! Now!

11:37.754 --> 11:41.357
All right, smartest thing
the guilty party could do

11:41.391 --> 11:44.060
would be confess before
I even bring up the crime.

11:44.094 --> 11:45.661
I did it.

11:45.695 --> 11:47.763
- You did?
- I think so.

11:47.798 --> 11:48.764
Then what did you do?

11:48.799 --> 11:51.767
I don't really know.
I kind of just panicked.

11:51.802 --> 11:55.538
Someone put something metal
in our very important microwave

11:55.572 --> 11:56.672
and broke it.

11:56.706 --> 11:58.441
Oh, no. I didn't do that.

11:58.475 --> 12:00.342
Someone did it.
And we're not leaving this room

12:00.377 --> 12:02.545
until your dad and I
find out who it was.

12:02.579 --> 12:03.679
I'll stay here all night.

12:03.713 --> 12:04.580
Can we watch TV?

12:04.614 --> 12:05.781
Try it.

12:05.816 --> 12:08.217
- Try turning it on.
- I'm good.

12:08.251 --> 12:10.619
- Can I pee?
- Nope.

12:10.654 --> 12:13.022
That microwave
was a technological marvel,

12:13.056 --> 12:14.623
a wonder of modern science,

12:14.658 --> 12:17.226
and then some fiend destroyed it.

12:17.260 --> 12:18.928
Frankly, I'm disgusted.

12:18.962 --> 12:20.563
And since none of you are man enough

12:20.597 --> 12:21.764
to admit to your crime,

12:21.798 --> 12:23.732
the Dodger game tonight is off.

12:23.767 --> 12:25.601
- What?!
- Are you serious? But it's Bat Night!

12:25.635 --> 12:28.237
Oh... I know.

12:28.271 --> 12:31.640
Mike, it doesn't seem right
to punish everyone

12:31.675 --> 12:33.609
because your contraption got ruined

12:33.643 --> 12:35.778
in a mystery we may never solve.

12:35.812 --> 12:37.746
No confession, no Dodgers.

12:40.016 --> 12:41.817
Okay.

12:41.852 --> 12:43.986
Look, um... I'm sorry.

12:44.020 --> 12:46.222
Uh... the truth is...

12:46.256 --> 12:47.790
Instead, your mom and I are gonna go

12:47.824 --> 12:48.791
to that stupid dinner dance.

12:48.825 --> 12:50.559
It's exactly the right call.

12:50.594 --> 12:52.128
You boys will thank us one day.

12:52.162 --> 12:53.796
I'm gonna go pick out a dress.

12:55.000 --> 13:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:04.348 --> 13:07.706
Hi. I'm here to drop off pictures.

13:07.768 --> 13:09.979
Cool. What's the name?

13:10.004 --> 13:11.665
Jorgellington.

13:13.016 --> 13:15.084
"J," like Jackson.

13:15.109 --> 13:18.111
- Okay.
- "O," like ostrich.

13:20.957 --> 13:23.526
How much more dancing
until we get to sit down?

13:23.560 --> 13:26.529
You're not any worse
than any of the other husbands.

13:26.563 --> 13:28.130
Except for Herb Milbank.

13:28.165 --> 13:31.934
He and Katy took lessons
at Arthur Murray.

13:31.968 --> 13:33.135
What a loser.

13:33.170 --> 13:34.470
Sad, really.

13:36.873 --> 13:38.874
I guess I'm still bugged
about the microwave.

13:38.909 --> 13:41.710
No one has a right
to be more upset than me.

13:41.745 --> 13:44.280
I'm the one who doesn't
get to use it anymore.

13:44.314 --> 13:47.052
Aloha. Ahiahi, Mike and Peggy.

13:47.077 --> 13:48.284
Concentrate.

13:50.921 --> 13:53.889
You'd think they'd be embarrassed.

13:53.924 --> 13:56.125
I'm kicking myself now

13:56.159 --> 13:57.693
for not ordering the double prints.

13:57.727 --> 13:59.995
My friend Todd's a good tracer.

14:00.030 --> 14:01.830
He can mock something up
for us pretty quickly.

14:01.865 --> 14:05.301
Hey. A lot of whispering going
on between you two lately.

14:05.335 --> 14:07.069
Anything you'd care to open up about?

14:07.103 --> 14:09.872
What? We weren't whispering.

14:09.906 --> 14:10.940
Guys, can you come in here a minute?

14:14.344 --> 14:15.711
- The Dodgers are on.
- Yeah.

14:15.745 --> 14:18.881
Circle up. It'll just take a second.

14:18.915 --> 14:19.682
I want to rap.

14:19.716 --> 14:21.717
Oh, geez. He's sitting backwards.

14:21.751 --> 14:23.352
Sensing a bad vibe in the house

14:23.386 --> 14:25.721
about what happened to the microwave.

14:25.755 --> 14:28.357
Now, I'm not interested in placing blame

14:28.391 --> 14:29.758
or narcing on anyone...

14:29.793 --> 14:30.926
Then I'm out.

14:30.961 --> 14:33.329
...but I believe that Dad

14:33.363 --> 14:36.932
put a lot of his self-worth
inside that little, metal box.

14:36.967 --> 14:40.769
And whoever blew it up,
in a way, also blew up Dad.

14:40.804 --> 14:42.938
And, until he gets closure on this,

14:42.973 --> 14:44.573
it's gonna be really hard for him,

14:44.608 --> 14:46.596
and he's just gonna keep
punishing everybody.

14:46.631 --> 14:48.787
Like you not letting us
watch the Dodger game?

14:48.812 --> 14:52.748
So, if any of us is carrying
around a heavy secret,

14:52.782 --> 14:55.251
I'm here to facilitate
getting it off your chest.

14:55.285 --> 14:56.885
I haven't read the whole Bible,

14:56.920 --> 14:58.887
but pretty sure
when you quit the seminary,

14:58.922 --> 15:00.789
you lose your confession license.

15:00.824 --> 15:03.359
Right on. I've said my piece.

15:03.393 --> 15:04.326
Wait a minute.

15:04.361 --> 15:07.196
- Yes, William?
- Has it occurred to you that

15:07.230 --> 15:10.599
maybe you're throwing all this
psychology at everybody else

15:10.634 --> 15:13.035
as a way of ignoring your own issues?

15:13.069 --> 15:15.404
What do you... What do you mean?

15:15.438 --> 15:17.573
It seems like since
you gave up the priesthood,

15:17.607 --> 15:19.375
you've lost your sense of identity,

15:19.409 --> 15:20.943
so you started poking at all of us

15:20.977 --> 15:23.579
because it's scary to look at yourself

15:23.613 --> 15:26.738
and realize that
you're not that special anymore.

15:26.850 --> 15:28.879
Do you think maybe
that's what's going on here?

15:33.923 --> 15:36.258
Heavy truths from a tiny man.

15:36.293 --> 15:37.926
You've given me a lot to chew on.

15:37.961 --> 15:39.995
Thanks, buddy.

15:42.999 --> 15:46.969
That was amazing. How did you do that?

15:47.003 --> 15:48.937
I just started talking like him.

15:48.972 --> 15:50.506
I think that's all he wanted.

15:57.213 --> 15:59.815
Don't they ever get tired
of making a spectacle?

15:59.849 --> 16:02.451
Sabotaged by one of my own kids.

16:02.485 --> 16:05.621
Oh, let it go. Try to enjoy your poi.

16:05.655 --> 16:07.189
What kind of monsters are we raising?

16:07.223 --> 16:09.625
They're animals. They eat dirt.

16:09.659 --> 16:12.194
They fall off things.
They save their farts in jars.

16:12.228 --> 16:13.996
Probably put that fork in there

16:14.030 --> 16:16.999
just to see what would happen.

16:17.033 --> 16:18.467
I never said it was a fork.

16:20.870 --> 16:21.837
Sure you did.

16:21.871 --> 16:24.840
All I said was something metal.

16:24.874 --> 16:28.644
No, you said fork. I'm sure you...

16:30.413 --> 16:31.847
All right, I hated that thing.

16:31.881 --> 16:32.848
My God, it was you.

16:32.882 --> 16:34.683
Look, I told you I didn't
want it in my kitchen,

16:34.718 --> 16:37.286
which is my domain,
but you never listen!

16:37.320 --> 16:39.688
You always do things your way,
like you're Frank Sinatra.

16:39.723 --> 16:42.491
You stuck a knife in my back...
with a fork!

16:42.525 --> 16:43.529
I'm a housewife, Mike.

16:43.554 --> 16:46.295
I'm not some space woman
from "Star Trek."

16:46.329 --> 16:48.497
I want to cook normal food
my own way in my own house,

16:48.531 --> 16:50.699
except for the one night a year
when I want to eat out and go dancing

16:50.734 --> 16:52.034
because it's our anniversary!

16:52.068 --> 16:53.836
And you wanted to go to Bat Night.

16:53.870 --> 16:56.805
Wait, our... our anniversary.

16:56.840 --> 16:58.173
- Today?
- Mm.

16:58.208 --> 16:59.241
Tonight?

16:59.275 --> 17:01.977
Wh... Why didn't you tell me?

17:02.011 --> 17:03.379
I did, but you never listen.

17:03.413 --> 17:06.080
<i>It was a magnificent
coup de grace by my mother,</i>

17:06.116 --> 17:09.582
<i>particularly because
it wasn't their anniversary.</i>

17:09.607 --> 17:10.786
<i>In a tight spot, my mom was known</i>

17:10.819 --> 17:13.321
<i>to push this button
up to four times a year.</i>

17:13.356 --> 17:16.090
This was unforgivable.

17:16.126 --> 17:18.727
Peg, I...

17:18.762 --> 17:21.329
I am so sorry.

17:21.364 --> 17:23.732
Well...

17:23.767 --> 17:26.335
I'm sorry, too,

17:26.368 --> 17:29.571
for the much less bad thing that I did.

17:29.606 --> 17:32.174
I guess I wasn't listening
to you about the microwave

17:32.208 --> 17:33.575
because I was so excited thinking that

17:33.610 --> 17:34.710
I might be able to help you.

17:34.744 --> 17:37.279
Help me? With what?

17:37.313 --> 17:39.581
I see how you slave for me and the kids.

17:39.616 --> 17:42.017
Shovelling food into us all day

17:42.051 --> 17:44.186
- like it's feeding time at SeaWorld.
- Oh.

17:44.220 --> 17:45.521
I thought maybe that stupid machine

17:45.555 --> 17:47.790
could make things easier,
maybe make you happy.

17:47.824 --> 17:50.192
Oh, hon.

17:50.226 --> 17:52.887
I don't want to be happy.

17:52.912 --> 17:55.814
I like things just the way they are.

18:00.270 --> 18:03.405
I'll do a much better job
listening. I promise.

18:03.440 --> 18:05.407
I'm a big dope,
and I'd be lost without you.

18:05.442 --> 18:09.144
Okay, then.

18:09.179 --> 18:10.979
And I'll try to remember anniversaries.

18:11.014 --> 18:12.781
I guess I could write it down.

18:12.816 --> 18:16.151
Aww, don't worry. I'll remind you.

18:20.023 --> 18:22.391
Guys, wait.

18:22.425 --> 18:24.560
What if the Fotomat guy peeked
and called the authorities?

18:24.594 --> 18:26.462
Lewis is cool.
He's done jobs for me before.

18:26.496 --> 18:28.063
What if Timmy's right?

18:28.097 --> 18:30.446
Maybe just one of us should go.

18:38.174 --> 18:40.175
Good morning.

18:40.210 --> 18:42.411
The name is Jorgellington.

18:42.445 --> 18:45.080
Here you go. $11.47.

18:50.286 --> 18:52.020
Thank you!

18:57.694 --> 18:59.628
Oh, that was close.

18:59.662 --> 19:00.996
That cop might still be on my tail!

19:01.030 --> 19:02.197
You should lay low for a few days.

19:02.232 --> 19:03.765
I know a safe house in Eagle Rock.

19:03.800 --> 19:05.767
Boring stuff at Davey's place,

19:05.802 --> 19:07.169
your mom asleep on the sofa,

19:07.203 --> 19:10.439
your... mom asleep on the floor.

19:10.473 --> 19:13.642
Oh, my God. There it is.

19:13.676 --> 19:15.444
<i>The legend of Barbara Eden's
"Bob Hope Show"</i>

19:15.478 --> 19:16.945
<i>was one of those great urban myths</i>

19:16.980 --> 19:18.741
<i>which sweep across schoolyards
from time to time.</i>

19:18.766 --> 19:21.517
- Let me see it. Joey.
- <i>There was absolutely nothing to see...</i>

19:21.551 --> 19:22.595
<i>...but nearly every</i>

19:22.619 --> 19:24.152
<i>pre-pubescent boy in America</i>

19:24.153 --> 19:25.320
<i>claimed he had seen it.</i>

19:25.355 --> 19:27.523
- I've never seen anything like it.
- Me neither!

19:27.557 --> 19:28.590
I-I mean...

19:28.625 --> 19:34.029
I've seen plenty,
just not one exactly like it.

19:34.063 --> 19:36.465
You can see everything.

19:36.499 --> 19:37.866
<i>Sure, that photo was just a picture</i>

19:37.901 --> 19:39.234
<i>of Davey's brother's thumb,</i>

19:39.269 --> 19:41.236
<i>but it started me and Joey on a path</i>

19:41.271 --> 19:43.238
<i>of raunchy, wonderful boy adventures</i>

19:43.273 --> 19:44.794
<i>all through adolescence and beyond.</i>

19:44.888 --> 19:46.333
Ooh, la, la.

19:48.077 --> 19:49.504
<i>I love you, Barbara Eden.</i>

19:50.661 --> 19:53.169
<i>My dad never gave up
embracing new technology</i>

19:53.240 --> 19:55.036
<i>and trying to make things
better for my mother.</i>

19:55.099 --> 19:56.591
It's called the Strap Vac.

19:56.646 --> 19:57.613
Instead of pushing it,

19:57.647 --> 20:00.142
you carry it on your back
around the house.

20:00.197 --> 20:01.217
Less work.

20:01.251 --> 20:03.786
For who? The vacuum?

20:03.820 --> 20:05.654
<i>And he eventually repaired the microwave</i>

20:05.689 --> 20:06.956
<i>and Mom made her peace with it...</i>

20:06.990 --> 20:08.591
<i>as long as it stayed out in the garage.</i>

20:09.793 --> 20:12.428
Here you go.

20:12.462 --> 20:14.597
Mm! Toasty!

20:14.631 --> 20:16.799
You're the best cook ever, Mom!

20:19.269 --> 20:21.770
It's not even on anymore!
