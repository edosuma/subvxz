I can't believe it.
What's the world coming to?

08:39.589 --> 08:42.673
- Probably to an end,
'cause I'm not bringing a ring.

08:42.756 --> 08:45.464
- Well, at least Donna knows
what she wants,

08:45.547 --> 08:47.714

that's you.

08:47.798 --> 08:49.005

08:49.089 --> 08:50.214

It wasn't my strength.
It was my fucking fear.

- That's right.

was actually

this whole thing to end?

the franchise fee.

in a two-step game.

25:45.547 --> 25:47.464
Now let's begin.

25:47.547 --> 25:49.172
- There's been
an ongoing dialogue

25:49.255 --> 25:50.923
about schedule expansion.

25:51.005 --> 25:53.214
In anticipation of the CBA,

25:53.297 --> 25:55.798
it's time to for clarity
and a consensus

25:55.881 --> 25:57.422
regarding an 18-game schedule.

25:57.506 --> 26:00.172
- Lose two worthless
preseason games

26:00.255 --> 26:02.881
and add two more games
to the schedule.

26:02.964 --> 26:05.339
- That's gonna antagonize
the NFLPA.

26:05.422 --> 26:06.923
- We'll make it part
of a bigger package.

26:07.005 --> 26:08.589
- That's a mistake.

26:08.673 --> 26:11.673
- All in favor of an expanded
schedule say "aye."

26:11.756 --> 26:13.589
[together]
Aye.

26:20.798 --> 26:22.130
- Aye.

26:23.422 --> 26:25.047

26:25.130 --> 26:28.130
Congratulations to our fans.
[laughs]

26:29.422 --> 26:30.631
That's good.

26:30.714 --> 26:32.130
- Shall we move on?

26:32.214 --> 26:34.130
- You have the floor.

26:37.839 --> 26:41.839
- We are the custodians
of an institution.

26:41.923 --> 26:43.798
We owe it to ourselves
to look out

26:43.881 --> 26:46.756
for that institution,
but that starts by looking out

26:46.839 --> 26:48.881
for the people who actually
play the game.

26:50.381 --> 26:54.589
Now our pension package trails
that of every pro sport.

26:54.673 --> 26:59.547
And when you consider that
we're at $43,000 on average...

26:59.631 --> 27:03.714
versus a $57,000 minimum
with the NBA,

27:03.798 --> 27:05.798
when our game
is much more violent

27:05.881 --> 27:08.172
and much more debilitating.

27:09.381 --> 27:14.005
And trust me,
I know about that firsthand.

27:14.089 --> 27:16.714
Jim Brown, Deacon Eller,

27:16.798 --> 27:20.631
Dick Butkus, and Earl Campbell,
they deserve better.

27:20.714 --> 27:24.089
They've earned the right
to be treated right.

27:24.172 --> 27:26.547
And there's no reason
why any of our NFL veterans

27:26.631 --> 27:28.673
should ever go broke
or die lonely

27:28.756 --> 27:30.381
trying to pay medical bills.

27:31.881 --> 27:33.923
We're the gold standard.

27:34.005 --> 27:35.673
We should act like it,

27:35.756 --> 27:37.714
and we should never let
our game

27:37.798 --> 27:41.714
or our NFL veterans
down...ever.
