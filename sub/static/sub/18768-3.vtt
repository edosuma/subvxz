HUMPHREY: Sorry!

00:13.240 --> 00:15.200
I'm coming!

00:15.280 --> 00:16.680
Sorry, I'm coming!

00:16.760 --> 00:18.240
Sorry, sorry...

00:20.360 --> 00:21.520
Sorry.

00:23.840 --> 00:25.200
Bit of an ordeal
locking the station.

00:25.280 --> 00:26.600
Couldn't find my keys.

00:26.680 --> 00:27.800
Er, shall we?

00:27.880 --> 00:28.920
Absolutely.

00:30.800 --> 00:31.880
Hello!

00:31.960 --> 00:32.920
Merci.

00:48.240 --> 00:49.800
Good evening.

00:49.880 --> 00:51.880
Welcome to La Maison Cecile.
We've been expecting you.

00:51.960 --> 00:53.080
My name is Elliot Taylor.

00:53.160 --> 00:54.560
This is my wife, Linda.

00:54.640 --> 00:55.880
Humphrey Goodman.

00:55.960 --> 00:59.320
Er, this is my...
Erm, er, this is Martha.

00:59.400 --> 01:01.520
-Hello.
-Let's get you
up to the hotel.

01:18.120 --> 01:21.040
Irie, this is
Mr and Mrs Goodman
checking in.

01:21.120 --> 01:22.520
Oh, we aren't
actually married...

01:22.600 --> 01:24.280
Elliot will take
your bags to your room.

01:24.360 --> 01:26.840
Now, if there's
anything you need,
you just let us know.

01:26.920 --> 01:31.600
Welcome to La Maison Cecile,
Mr Goodman, Mrs Goodman.

01:31.680 --> 01:36.360
Yes, we aren't, erm,
or rather, er, she isn't my...

01:36.440 --> 01:40.120
So, if I could just take
a copy of the credit card
that you booked with.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.160
Yes, of course.

01:42.680 --> 01:43.760
Oh!

01:43.840 --> 01:45.240
Cecile Dumas.

01:45.320 --> 01:46.960
Is this who
the hotel's named after?

01:47.040 --> 01:48.920
That's right, madam.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.400
Her husband was a very rich
plantation owner
from Saint Marie.

01:52.480 --> 01:54.160
He bought the island
and built this house

01:54.240 --> 01:56.240
to show her how
much he loved her.

01:56.320 --> 01:58.280
There you go, sir.

01:58.360 --> 02:02.680
You are in Room Six
which is just up the stairs
and to the right.

02:02.760 --> 02:04.040
I hope you enjoy your stay.

02:04.120 --> 02:05.000
Thank you.

02:09.160 --> 02:10.120

02:17.320 --> 02:19.280
Oh, it's lovely.

02:26.840 --> 02:28.240
Oh, wow!

02:28.320 --> 02:30.280
This is perfect, Humphrey.

02:30.360 --> 02:33.160
Right. I'm gonna
go and unpack.

02:33.240 --> 02:34.200
OK.

02:40.600 --> 02:41.720
Good evening.

02:42.720 --> 02:43.680
Hi!

02:48.520 --> 02:49.840
There you go,

02:49.920 --> 02:52.200
and in addition to
what is on the menu,

02:52.280 --> 02:54.600
we also have
our house speciality,

02:54.680 --> 02:57.800
grilled fresh lobster.
I highly recommend it.

02:57.880 --> 02:59.840
I'll just get you
an ice bucket for your wine.

03:01.040 --> 03:02.440
Oh, damn it!

03:02.520 --> 03:04.280
-What's that?
-I saw him earlier.

03:04.360 --> 03:05.920
One of the guests, I think.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.760
-Had a bit too
much to drink...
-Oh dear.

03:07.840 --> 03:09.200
ELLIOT: What's going on?
CHARLIE: Nothing.
Everything's fine.

03:09.280 --> 03:11.320
ELLIOT: You're drunk.
CHARLIE: No, I'm not!

03:11.400 --> 03:13.840
ELLIOT: Samuel, get Ernestine
to make him a sandwich
he needs to sober up.

03:13.920 --> 03:15.800
-Get off me.
-Go upstairs.

03:15.880 --> 03:17.760
ELLIOT: The guests
will hear you.
CHARLIE: All right. I'm going.

you'll be back in London.

03:31.240 --> 03:32.320
Yeah.

03:32.400 --> 03:34.440
New job. New start.

03:34.520 --> 03:37.080
-It's all rather exciting.
-(CHUCKLING)

03:37.160 --> 03:38.640
I am gonna miss
Saint Marie though.

03:39.760 --> 03:42.120
And you.

03:42.200 --> 03:44.080
It's been lovely,
our little holiday romance.

03:44.160 --> 03:46.040
Who'd have thought it, eh?

03:46.120 --> 03:49.040
All those years ago,
you serving me coffee
and a blueberry muffin.

03:49.120 --> 03:50.840
-Here we are.
-Yeah.

03:50.920 --> 03:52.520
Here we are.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.640

What the hell was that?

04:08.360 --> 04:11.240
-What's going on?
-Excuse me. Sorry.

04:13.040 --> 04:15.280
Uh, stay here,
keep an eye on the guests.

04:16.400 --> 04:17.360
Ernestine?

04:18.280 --> 04:19.440
It's Charlie...

04:22.880 --> 04:24.080
Oh, God.

04:30.520 --> 04:31.480
He's dead.

04:32.960 --> 04:34.920
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

05:03.320 --> 05:05.520
He's been stabbed,
directly to the abdomen.

05:05.600 --> 05:07.160
Oh, Charlie...

05:07.240 --> 05:08.280
Is he a guest?

05:08.360 --> 05:10.960
Er, no. He's my brother.

05:11.040 --> 05:12.320
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.960
Looks like someone broke in,

05:18.040 --> 05:19.920
possibly looking for something
when they got
interrupted by your brother.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.680
Are there any valuables here
that might have been taken?

05:21.760 --> 05:23.600
Not that I can think of.

05:23.680 --> 05:25.160
They didn't take the laptop.

05:25.240 --> 05:27.600
What about his watch?
It was his father's.

05:27.680 --> 05:28.720
HUMPHREY: No watch.

05:28.800 --> 05:30.000
We should call the police.

05:30.080 --> 05:32.880
Er, actually,
erm, I am the police.

05:32.960 --> 05:34.200
Sorry. Should've mentioned.

05:34.280 --> 05:36.760
I'm Detective Inspector
Humphrey Goodman.

05:36.840 --> 05:38.720
There's no wallet either.

05:38.800 --> 05:41.800
Ernestine, when you came
upstairs, did you see
anyone else up here?

05:41.880 --> 05:42.880
No one.

05:42.960 --> 05:44.480
Apart from the main staircase,

05:44.560 --> 05:45.960
what other points of access
are there to this floor?

05:46.040 --> 05:47.600
None.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.040
You think whoever did this
might still be in the hotel?

05:49.120 --> 05:51.160
I doubt it.

05:51.240 --> 05:53.080
I imagine they'd have wanted
to get out of here as
quickly as possible.

05:53.160 --> 05:56.600
But there is a chance
they might still
be on the island.

05:56.680 --> 05:59.160
So, if you're
mooring a boat here,
the only place is the jetty?

05:59.240 --> 06:01.080
Yes, the rest
of the shoreline's too rocky.

06:01.160 --> 06:02.840
-No beaches on the island?
-No.

06:04.640 --> 06:06.320
ELLIOT: Can't see a boat.

06:07.640 --> 06:10.640
No. Neither can I.

06:10.720 --> 06:13.680
The killer must
still be on the island.
Now, how did they get in?

06:17.440 --> 06:19.000
So which one's Charlie's room?

06:19.080 --> 06:20.280
That's it, there...

06:28.000 --> 06:28.960
Inspector?

06:30.680 --> 06:31.880
Here...

06:33.120 --> 06:35.560
Oh, sorry, no,
I should be doing that.

06:35.640 --> 06:37.480
Don't be silly.
You've had a shock.

06:40.040 --> 06:41.560
Did you find anyone?

06:41.640 --> 06:44.160
No sign of anyone or any boat.

06:44.240 --> 06:46.200
But there's not much more
any of us can do tonight.

06:46.280 --> 06:48.120
The paramedics won't
be able to head over
until the morning.

06:48.200 --> 06:51.040
And I'll arrange
for my colleagues
to join me first thing.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.320
In the meantime,
I suggest
everyone heads to bed.

06:53.400 --> 06:56.520
And make sure
the doors and windows
are locked, just in case.

06:56.600 --> 06:58.480
I'll have to secure
the crime scene.

06:58.560 --> 07:00.120
So I'll need all
the keys you have
to Charlie's room.

07:00.200 --> 07:01.920
And the master,
if there is one.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.200
I'll get them.

07:05.320 --> 07:06.400
Are you all right?

07:06.480 --> 07:08.840
Me? Yeah fine, OK.

07:08.920 --> 07:12.520
Martha, I couldn't
borrow your brain
for a minute, could I?

07:16.400 --> 07:18.160
So...

07:18.240 --> 07:21.240
So that's the balcony
belonging to
the victim's bedroom.

07:21.320 --> 07:24.440
Whoever killed him
climbed up there and broke in.

07:24.520 --> 07:27.480
Here's the thing, look...

07:27.560 --> 07:29.120
MARTHA: What am I looking at?

07:29.200 --> 07:30.480
HUMPHREY: The flower-bed.

07:30.560 --> 07:32.920
-There aren't any footprints.
-Exactly.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.360
The soil's still
perfectly raked.

07:35.440 --> 07:37.640
And if someone had
climbed up there...

07:37.720 --> 07:40.240
There'd be signs of damage,
broken flowers,

07:40.320 --> 07:42.720
ripped stems.
But there's not
a petal out of place.

07:43.800 --> 07:45.840
So, what are you saying?

07:45.920 --> 07:49.280
That someone has staged that
crime scene to look like
a burglary gone wrong.

07:49.360 --> 07:51.480
Committed by some
unknown intruder.

07:51.560 --> 07:53.720
So, there wasn't an intruder?

07:53.800 --> 07:55.840
No, I don't think there was.

07:55.920 --> 07:59.360
In which case you think
it's someone from inside
the hotel who killed him?

07:59.440 --> 08:01.000
I do.

08:01.080 --> 08:04.600
Except, if that is the case...

08:06.400 --> 08:08.120
Then there's a small problem.

08:09.840 --> 08:11.520
Now, I noticed the victim

08:11.600 --> 08:13.120
fall down the stairs.

08:13.200 --> 08:15.240
MARTHA: You thought
he'd had too much to drink.

08:15.320 --> 08:17.600
HUMPHREY: Later on, I saw him
come back from the kitchen,

08:17.680 --> 08:21.120
go through the dining room
with a sandwich
and go upstairs.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.760
Ten minutes later Ernestine,

08:22.840 --> 08:25.800
the hotel chef, went upstairs
and discovered the body.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.120
Which is when we
heard the scream
and you went to investigate.

08:28.200 --> 08:29.680
At which point,
everyone in the hotel,

08:29.760 --> 08:31.760
apart from Ernestine,
was downstairs.

08:31.840 --> 08:33.440
All the guests
were with you in
the dining room,

08:33.520 --> 08:35.440
and all the staff were here
in the hallway.

08:35.520 --> 08:38.080
Well, then I suppose one
of them was already up
there waiting for him,

08:38.160 --> 08:42.040
or they snuck upstairs
after the victim
went into his room.

08:42.120 --> 08:43.800
Killed him and then
snuck back down again

08:43.880 --> 08:45.360
before the body
was discovered.

08:45.440 --> 08:47.280
Yeah, but that's the thing,
you see.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.240
There's no other way
up to his room
apart from this staircase.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.040
And I had full view

08:51.120 --> 08:52.920
from our table
in the dining room
the entire 10 minutes.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.200
I would've noticed
anyone going up and
coming back down again.

08:55.280 --> 08:56.600
And I didn't.

08:56.680 --> 08:57.880
Well, then how did one of them
manage to do it?

09:42.240 --> 09:43.920
Inspector,
the keys you asked for.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.840
Thank you.

09:45.920 --> 09:48.560
Mrs Taylor, I wonder,
was the deceased a smoker,
do you know?

09:48.640 --> 09:51.240
Only I found
a packet of cigarettes
on his bedside table.

09:51.320 --> 09:53.280
Not since I've known him.

09:53.360 --> 09:56.360
It's just that they look like
they're really
rather out of date.

09:57.800 --> 09:59.200
(SHRUGS)

09:59.280 --> 10:01.160
Was there anything else?

10:01.240 --> 10:03.520
Nothing else. Thank you.

10:20.440 --> 10:22.240
-(THUD)
-(CRIES OUT)

10:22.320 --> 10:23.480
Oh...

10:25.560 --> 10:28.200
Sorry, was trying
not to wake you.

10:28.280 --> 10:31.360
So I have to work, I'm afraid.

10:31.440 --> 10:34.200
Not quite what I had planned
for our last weekend together.

10:34.280 --> 10:36.560
Probably best if I head back
to the mainland.

10:36.640 --> 10:37.920
-Leave you to it.
-Yes.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.080
See you tonight though?

10:39.160 --> 10:40.240
Yeah, of course.

10:47.320 --> 10:48.680
You might want to
move that bag though.

10:48.760 --> 10:49.720
(LAUGHING)

10:50.320 --> 10:51.360
Bye.

10:53.680 --> 10:55.680
So, Martha is
leaving the island?

10:55.760 --> 10:59.240
-It's such a shame, sir.
-Yes, is all
rather disappointing.

10:59.320 --> 11:00.600
Nonetheless, a murder
has been committed

11:00.680 --> 11:02.000
and we have a duty
to solve it.

11:02.080 --> 11:03.920
So what do we know?

11:04.000 --> 11:06.360
What we know, Florence,
is the victim is a man
named Charlie Taylor.

11:06.440 --> 11:08.080
His body was
discovered last night

11:08.160 --> 11:10.400
at 10 minutes past 10
by the hotel chef.

11:10.480 --> 11:13.280
A single stab wound
to the abdomen seems
to be what did for him.

11:13.360 --> 11:16.080
A two centimetre
non-serrated knife,
by my reckoning.

11:16.160 --> 11:18.200
There's no sign
of it at the scene.

11:18.280 --> 11:21.080
To all appearances
it looks like an intruder
climbed up to the balcony

11:21.160 --> 11:22.880
outside Mr Taylor's room,

11:22.960 --> 11:25.040
broke in and was
interrupted mid-robbery.

11:25.120 --> 11:26.480
But, what, you don't think
that's the case, sir?

11:26.560 --> 11:28.120
No I do not, JP.

11:28.200 --> 11:30.160
The flowerbeds and trellising
beneath Mr Taylor's room

11:30.240 --> 11:31.880
show no signs of disturbance.

11:31.960 --> 11:34.680
So, however the killer
did make it into his room,

11:34.760 --> 11:36.640
it certainly wasn't
via that balcony.

11:36.720 --> 11:39.280
DWAYNE: So what, you think
it was someone
from inside the hotel?

11:39.360 --> 11:41.240
Very possibly, Dwayne.

11:41.320 --> 11:43.360
Except there's
one slight problem.

11:43.440 --> 11:46.600
We have a key witness
whose statement undermines
that theory entirely.

11:46.680 --> 11:47.680
Really?

11:47.760 --> 11:48.800
Who's the key witness?

11:49.320 --> 11:50.600
It's me.

11:50.680 --> 11:52.720
-You, Chief?
-Yes.

11:52.800 --> 11:53.920
What are the chances, eh?

11:58.800 --> 12:00.760
And the other guests were
down here also?

12:00.840 --> 12:02.400
They were in the dining room

12:02.480 --> 12:04.200
visible to me at the time
when the victim was killed.

12:04.280 --> 12:06.560
But I thought you said
the hotel staff
were downstairs as well?

12:06.640 --> 12:08.280
They were.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.160
Except they were
out of my sight
during the timeframe.

12:10.240 --> 12:12.080
So, they must've
been the only people
who had the opportunity

12:12.160 --> 12:13.400
to kill Charlie Taylor.

12:13.480 --> 12:15.120
I just don't know
how they managed

12:15.200 --> 12:18.320
to get up and down
these stairs
without me noticing.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.520
So, Florence, you and I
need to talk to the staff.

12:20.600 --> 12:22.000
While we're doing that,
Dwayne and JP,

12:22.080 --> 12:23.480
here's the key
to the victim's room.

12:23.560 --> 12:24.920
You know what to do.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.640
Photographs, fingerprints.
Bag the evidence.

12:26.720 --> 12:28.520
And look out for the knife
that killed him.

12:28.600 --> 12:30.440
Oh, and I noticed the victim

12:30.520 --> 12:33.120
carrying a document folder
earlier in the evening.

12:33.200 --> 12:34.520
Might be worth
keeping an eye out for that.

12:34.600 --> 12:35.600
Yes, Chief.

12:44.600 --> 12:47.960
So, I'd like to start by
asking where you all were
in the 10 minutes

12:48.040 --> 12:50.120
prior to the deceased's
body being found.

12:50.200 --> 12:51.680
Mr and Mrs Taylor?

12:51.760 --> 12:54.080
Er, I was in my office
going over the accounts.

12:54.160 --> 12:56.680
In the kitchen,
clearing up for the night.

12:56.760 --> 12:57.800
You were both alone?

12:57.880 --> 12:59.280
-Yes.
-Yes.

12:59.360 --> 13:01.120
And what about
the rest of you?

13:01.200 --> 13:03.360
I was at the hotel
reception all night.

13:03.440 --> 13:05.200
I was down in the wine cellar.

13:05.280 --> 13:07.240
But there wasn't
anyone with me.

13:07.320 --> 13:10.040
Ernestine,
before you headed upstairs,
where had you been?

13:10.680 --> 13:12.080
Out here.

13:12.160 --> 13:14.480
It gets hot in that kitchen
and I needed some air.

13:15.200 --> 13:16.920
So to be clear,

13:17.000 --> 13:18.560
none of you have an alibi

13:18.640 --> 13:20.960
during the 10 minutes in which
the victim was killed?

13:21.040 --> 13:25.520
OK. Did anyone else see
Charlie before he went
upstairs to his room?

13:25.600 --> 13:27.040
When he came into the kitchen

13:27.120 --> 13:30.840
to collect the sandwich
Elliot asked me to make him.

13:30.920 --> 13:33.760
-He took
the sandwich and left?
-Yes, he went straight up.

13:33.840 --> 13:35.000
You saw him as well?

13:36.600 --> 13:37.840
Thank you, Ernestine.

13:40.160 --> 13:42.320
Does anyone know why
Mr Taylor had been drinking?

13:42.400 --> 13:44.320
It's not like Charlie at all.

13:44.400 --> 13:47.840
I saw him returning
from the jetty at the start
of the evening.

13:47.920 --> 13:49.640
Does anyone know
where he'd been?

13:49.720 --> 13:52.560
Looked like he had
a folder with him.

13:52.640 --> 13:55.200
And, how had things been
with him recently?

13:55.280 --> 13:56.360
Any fallings out?

13:56.440 --> 13:58.400
Not as far as I'm aware.

13:58.480 --> 14:00.600
And the deceased ran
the hotel with you?

14:00.680 --> 14:02.160
Not really.

14:02.240 --> 14:03.680
I mean, he had a share in it.

14:03.760 --> 14:06.600
But Charlie moved away
about 20 years ago.

14:06.680 --> 14:09.400
Our parents owned
the place originally.
We took it over from them.

14:09.480 --> 14:12.600
Charlie was involved
in the early days when
I was off at university.

14:12.680 --> 14:15.520
But then he just got
a bit bored with it all.

14:15.600 --> 14:17.480
It wasn't really
Charlie's thing,
was it, love?

14:17.560 --> 14:18.560
No.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.440
When did Charlie come back?

14:20.520 --> 14:22.240
About three months ago.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.120
-Did he often visit?
-We hardly ever saw him,
to be honest.

14:24.200 --> 14:26.240
His room was always here
if he wanted it.

14:26.320 --> 14:30.200
-So why did he come back now?
-I have no idea.

14:30.280 --> 14:33.440
I had wondered if he
might have got himself
in a spot of bother.

14:33.520 --> 14:37.000
Always lived
a little on the edge,
did Charlie.

14:37.080 --> 14:39.480
-How long was he
planning to stay?
-Didn't say.

14:39.560 --> 14:41.640
And what did Mr Taylor
do for a living?

14:41.720 --> 14:44.400
I know he travelled
around a fair bit,

14:44.480 --> 14:47.320
did some volunteering
here and there.

14:47.400 --> 14:51.120
And what about everyone else?
How well did you
all know the deceased?

14:51.200 --> 14:54.000
I met him about
three months ago
when he first arrived.

14:54.080 --> 14:55.920
Me too.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.520
I met him when I started
working at the hotel
a couple of months back.

14:58.600 --> 15:00.120
Ernestine?

15:00.200 --> 15:03.480
It was Elliot and Charlie's
parents took me on here.

15:03.560 --> 15:05.600
I've known them
most of their lives.

15:07.120 --> 15:08.960
I see.

15:09.040 --> 15:12.120
Erm, I think
that's all for now.

15:12.200 --> 15:15.280
We, we, we'll need a room
to base ourselves
in while we're here.

15:15.360 --> 15:16.400
Yeah.

15:16.480 --> 15:17.480
OK, thank you.

15:18.640 --> 15:20.800
You've all been very helpful.

15:30.800 --> 15:32.400
(YAWNING)

15:34.200 --> 15:36.000
(GRUNTING)

15:43.640 --> 15:45.080
Right then, Florence.

15:45.160 --> 15:48.200
Let's work through
what we know. Erm...

15:50.920 --> 15:53.240
-FLORENCE: Sir?
-Sorry, erm...

15:53.320 --> 15:55.200
Erm, our victim...

15:55.280 --> 15:57.000
Charlie Taylor,
50 years of age.

15:57.080 --> 15:58.720
Initial checks
with Immigration

15:58.800 --> 16:01.800
show he arrived on Saint Marie
three months ago from Sudan.

16:01.880 --> 16:03.880
Yes, recently returned home
to the family nest,

16:03.960 --> 16:06.400
but interestingly
no one seems to know
why he came back.

16:06.480 --> 16:09.120
Which leads us
to our suspects.

16:09.200 --> 16:12.240
The victim's brother,
Elliot Taylor.

16:12.320 --> 16:13.680
Forty-five.

16:13.760 --> 16:16.960
He studied hospitality
and catering in Paris.

16:17.040 --> 16:20.000
And he's been
running the family hotel
since he graduated.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.800
And while he may be
the younger of
the two brothers,

16:21.880 --> 16:24.720
it seems Elliot is
the more responsible
of the pair.

16:24.800 --> 16:26.240
Linda Taylor...

16:26.320 --> 16:28.120
Forty-nine.

16:28.200 --> 16:31.000
She and the victim's brother
met when he was
studying in Paris.

16:31.080 --> 16:34.160
They moved back
after graduation
and got married.

16:34.240 --> 16:37.080
Around the same time
the victim moved away.

16:37.160 --> 16:39.000
Next is Samuel Palmer.

16:39.080 --> 16:41.200
Hotel's waiter and barman.

16:41.280 --> 16:42.760
Fifty years old.

16:42.840 --> 16:44.280
Saint Marie born and bred.

16:44.360 --> 16:46.400
He's the only
suspect to have form.

16:46.480 --> 16:49.600
He served a prison sentence
some years ago for arson.

16:49.680 --> 16:51.960
Might be worth
getting hold of
that case file.

16:52.040 --> 16:53.560
Irie Johnson.

16:53.640 --> 16:56.800
Hotel receptionist, 28.
Also local.

16:56.880 --> 16:59.360
He's been working at the hotel
for two years now.

16:59.440 --> 17:01.440
Background checks
show he's a widower.

17:01.520 --> 17:04.400
His wife died three years ago
in a boat accident,

17:04.480 --> 17:06.640
leaving him with one child.
A daughter.

17:06.720 --> 17:09.120
Goodness. Poor guy.

17:09.200 --> 17:11.120
Finally, Ernestine Gray.

17:11.200 --> 17:12.640
Sixty-two years old.

17:12.720 --> 17:14.960
She's the hotel's
long-standing chef.

17:15.040 --> 17:17.160
Worked here since she was 16.

17:17.240 --> 17:18.760
Let us not forget, Florence,

17:18.840 --> 17:21.080
it was Ernestine
who discovered
the victim's body.

17:21.160 --> 17:24.600
Of all our suspects she was
the only one who was
alone with the deceased

17:24.680 --> 17:26.720
after he was last seen alive.

17:26.800 --> 17:31.000
But, would she have had
time to stab him and
stage the crime scene?

17:31.080 --> 17:34.200
Well, admittedly she didn't
have long. But it's not
out of the question.

17:34.280 --> 17:35.480
At the very least,
we should talk to her.

17:37.280 --> 17:39.280
OK, Chief, Sarge.

17:39.360 --> 17:41.480
So, we've processed
the crime scene
and I've bagged up

17:41.560 --> 17:43.480
-all of
the victim's possessions.
-Excellent.

17:43.560 --> 17:46.080
Oh, I thought you might
like to see this.

17:46.160 --> 17:48.520
It was on the floor
next to the victim's desk.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.640
It's a UK telephone number.

17:50.720 --> 17:53.120
-I wonder who he was calling?
-Want me to check it out?

17:54.240 --> 17:56.760
Yes. Yes, why don't you?

17:56.840 --> 17:58.680
I'm going to have
a word with Ernestine.

18:09.080 --> 18:10.680
What are those?

18:10.760 --> 18:13.360
Pomme surette.
My favourite.

18:13.440 --> 18:14.680
Really? I've never
heard of them.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.440
They taste sweet
and sour all at once.

18:17.520 --> 18:20.040
-Here, let me.
-Thank you.

18:20.120 --> 18:23.800
I used to pick these for
Elliot and Charlie when
they were little boys.

18:23.880 --> 18:25.440
They couldn't
get enough of them.

18:25.520 --> 18:26.800
What were they
like growing up?

18:26.880 --> 18:28.400
Like most brothers.

18:28.480 --> 18:29.800
One minute
they're best of friends,

18:29.880 --> 18:32.560
next, they can't stand
the sight of each other.

18:32.640 --> 18:34.400
They were good kids at heart.

18:34.480 --> 18:36.560
Why did Charlie leave
all those years ago?

18:36.640 --> 18:38.960
I think he fell out of love
with the place.

18:39.040 --> 18:40.920
It suited Elliot, you know?

18:41.000 --> 18:42.640
Charlie became restless here.

18:42.720 --> 18:45.480
Like he was
searching for something
he couldn't find.

18:51.920 --> 18:53.440
Wow!

18:53.520 --> 18:55.600
Sweet and sour all at once.

18:55.680 --> 18:57.520
So I'm guessing
that you're stood there

18:57.600 --> 19:00.320
because you think maybe
I had something to do
with Charlie's murder?

19:00.400 --> 19:02.080
Well, I wouldn't
quite put it like that.

19:02.160 --> 19:05.040
But the truth is there was
a short period
of time in which

19:05.120 --> 19:10.920
you and the victim were alone
together, and in theory,
you could've killed him.

19:11.000 --> 19:15.080
I know they only thought of me
as the woman who
cooked their dinners.

19:15.160 --> 19:17.000
But I loved them
like they were my own.

19:17.080 --> 19:19.120
I would never hurt
either one of them.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.080
Is there anyone you think
might have done it?

19:22.120 --> 19:23.520
There was one thing.

19:23.600 --> 19:26.080
The other day I was
taking Charlie his lunch.

19:26.160 --> 19:28.720
And I heard raised voices.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.160
It was Charlie
and Irie arguing.

19:31.240 --> 19:32.520
HUMPHREY: Did you hear
what it was about?

19:32.600 --> 19:34.560
Charlie was angry
about something.

19:34.640 --> 19:37.880
Saying he couldn't
believe Irie thought
he'd get away with it.

19:41.840 --> 19:42.800
Thank you.

19:51.200 --> 19:52.800
How're you getting on
down here?

19:52.880 --> 19:56.160
(CLEARS THROAT) Oh, erm,
no sign of the stolen items.

19:56.240 --> 19:59.160
But I did find
these knives in,
er, one of the drawers,

19:59.240 --> 20:01.760
but none of them match
the width of the one
used to kill Mr Taylor.

20:02.840 --> 20:04.280
You check the dishwasher?

20:04.360 --> 20:06.160
-Dishwasher?
-Yes.

20:06.240 --> 20:08.920
The one right behind you
with the red
flashing light on it.

20:16.560 --> 20:18.960
Someone put on a wash
for just one knife?

20:22.600 --> 20:26.160
Two centimetres exactly.
It's non-serrated.

20:26.240 --> 20:29.400
It's got to be the weapon,
hasn't it?

20:29.480 --> 20:32.120
JP. Is there something
the matter with you today?

20:32.200 --> 20:33.200
With me?

20:33.280 --> 20:35.120
With all due respect,

20:35.200 --> 20:37.480
it doesn't feel like
you're performing
at your absolute best.

20:39.120 --> 20:40.600
(SIGHS)

20:40.680 --> 20:43.480
I, I didn't get much sleep
last night, Dwayne.

20:43.560 --> 20:46.040
Me and Rosey
had our first row.

20:46.120 --> 20:48.920
-Wait. Your first row?
-Mmm.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.600
How long have you
two been together now?

20:50.680 --> 20:51.920
Six months, isn't it?

20:52.000 --> 20:53.480
Yes, and three days.

20:53.560 --> 20:56.680
And in all that time
you've never had one argument?

20:56.760 --> 21:00.400
I, I guess we just,
you know, sort of, get on.

21:01.200 --> 21:03.080
Or rather, we did.

21:04.440 --> 21:05.440
JP.

21:06.160 --> 21:07.800
Couples argue.

21:07.880 --> 21:10.160
Especially married ones.

21:10.240 --> 21:13.480
All you need to do is pick up
some flowers on
your way home tonight,

21:13.560 --> 21:17.760
tell Rosey you're sorry,
it was all your fault and
you love her very much.

21:18.280 --> 21:20.400
Simple.

21:20.480 --> 21:25.560
But the thing is, Dwayne,
I'm not so sure that
it was all my fault.

21:25.640 --> 21:27.760
She had her part to play
as well, you know?

21:27.840 --> 21:30.440
JP, there's something
you have to understand.

21:30.520 --> 21:33.080
You're in a relationship
with a woman.

21:33.160 --> 21:35.880
It's always going
to be your fault.

21:35.960 --> 21:40.280
Now come on, you need to
start focusing on helping
the Chief solve this murder.

21:41.120 --> 21:42.160
Capiche?

21:42.240 --> 21:43.240
Yes.

21:43.880 --> 21:45.080
Capiche.

21:49.480 --> 21:52.200
FLORENCE:
Would you mind telling me
exactly what it is you know?

21:52.280 --> 21:53.400
Chief!

21:55.720 --> 21:58.200
Ah, JP, is this a dagger
I see before me?

21:58.280 --> 21:59.560
It sure is, Chief.

21:59.640 --> 22:02.240
Erm, we, er,
found it in the dishwasher.

22:02.320 --> 22:04.960
It was the only
thing in there.
And it's the right width.

22:05.040 --> 22:08.120
So, having somehow made it
upstairs and back down again
without being noticed,

22:08.200 --> 22:09.760
the killer also
went into the kitchen

22:09.840 --> 22:12.480
to dispose of the knife
after they committed murder?

22:12.560 --> 22:14.760
Right, let's get it back
to the lab when we
head back this evening.

22:14.840 --> 22:17.680
Oh, and the stolen wallet
and watch, any sign of
those on your travels?

22:17.760 --> 22:19.760
Er, not on the ground floor,
I'm afraid, sir.

22:19.840 --> 22:21.880
And not
upstairs either, Chief.

22:21.960 --> 22:24.760
OK. Er, JP, maybe a search
of the gardens
when you're done here.

22:24.840 --> 22:28.120
Those missing items have to be
on the island somewhere.

22:28.200 --> 22:30.200
Chief?

22:30.280 --> 22:32.880
I thought I'd make a start
working through
the victim's phone and laptop,

22:32.960 --> 22:34.840
see who's been
calling and emailing.

22:34.920 --> 22:37.120
-Very good.
-And, Chief...

22:37.200 --> 22:40.040
We found the document folder
you was going on about.

22:40.120 --> 22:41.280
Oh, yes? What was in it?

22:41.920 --> 22:43.520
Empty.

22:43.600 --> 22:46.280
Maybe Charlie Taylor
gave whatever was in it

22:46.360 --> 22:49.280
to whoever it was
he met yesterday afternoon.

22:49.360 --> 22:51.080
Oh, yes. Hmm.

22:51.160 --> 22:53.040
Any joy with the prints
on these cigarettes?

22:53.120 --> 22:55.960
Er, only the victim's
prints were on it, sir.
No one else's.

22:56.040 --> 22:59.160
Why would Charlie Taylor
have a past-its-best
packet of cigarettes?

22:59.240 --> 23:01.160
I mean, these must be
decades old.
Here, smell...

23:02.240 --> 23:03.240
Ooh!

23:03.320 --> 23:04.320
-Sir.
-Yes.

23:04.400 --> 23:05.880
You should hear this.

23:05.960 --> 23:07.360
That phone number we found.

23:07.440 --> 23:09.400
It's for the Metropolitan
Police Fraud Unit.

23:09.480 --> 23:11.080
Go on.

23:11.160 --> 23:12.880
They've been dealing with
a spate of credit card cloning

23:12.960 --> 23:14.480
over the last six months.

23:14.560 --> 23:17.600
Turned out the common link
was this hotel.

23:17.680 --> 23:19.840
The victims had
all stayed here.

23:19.920 --> 23:23.280
So, they called through
and ended up dealing with
Charlie Taylor about it.

23:23.360 --> 23:25.080
He said he'd look into it.

23:25.160 --> 23:26.680
But they never heard back.

23:26.760 --> 23:30.080
So, she still doesn't know
who was behind the crime.

23:30.160 --> 23:32.840
ERNESTINE: All I could tell
was that Charlie was
angry about something.

23:32.920 --> 23:36.600
Saying he couldn't believe
Irie thought he'd
get away with it.

23:36.680 --> 23:37.960
HUMPHREY: She might not know.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.480
But I think I do!

23:40.560 --> 23:41.560
Come on, Florence.

23:43.840 --> 23:45.840
Er, Mr Johnson.

23:45.920 --> 23:47.760
I wondered if we
could have a chat?

23:47.840 --> 23:49.040
Oh!

23:49.120 --> 23:50.920
Somewhere a bit
more private maybe?

23:51.000 --> 23:52.280
OK.

23:52.360 --> 23:54.440
-This way?
-Yeah.

23:54.520 --> 23:56.640
Why don't you have
a little look around?

24:09.680 --> 24:12.320
Sorry... You're saying that
someone's been stealing

24:12.400 --> 24:14.120
our customers'
credit card details?

24:14.200 --> 24:15.800
That's exactly
what I'm saying.

24:15.880 --> 24:17.600
And I'm also saying that
I believe it was you.

24:17.680 --> 24:19.200
Me?

24:19.280 --> 24:20.480
What makes you
think that it was me?

24:20.560 --> 24:22.480
Because I have a witness

24:22.560 --> 24:25.200
who overheard you
and the deceased having
an argument two days ago.

24:25.280 --> 24:28.160
In which Mr Taylor
was clearly heard asking you

24:28.240 --> 24:31.640
"How on earth did you think
you could get away with it?"

24:31.720 --> 24:34.160
Yes, I remember
that discussion.

24:34.240 --> 24:36.200
But it wasn't about
any fraud going on.

24:36.280 --> 24:39.240
It was about something else,
something unimportant.

24:39.320 --> 24:40.320
Sir.

24:40.400 --> 24:41.640
Two days ago.

24:41.720 --> 24:44.120
Text from an un-named contact.

24:44.200 --> 24:46.080
"When's the next
batch coming?"

24:46.160 --> 24:48.720
The reply, "We need to stop.

24:48.800 --> 24:50.480
"They know."

24:50.560 --> 24:53.480
Please stop wasting our time,
Mr Johnson.

25:04.600 --> 25:07.000
My daughter started
school this year.

25:07.080 --> 25:08.680
She's four.

25:08.760 --> 25:10.960
My sister takes care of her
when I'm here, but,

25:11.040 --> 25:15.040
she has a job to
hold down herself
and childcare isn't cheap.

25:15.120 --> 25:17.400
So you thought you'd earn
a bit extra on the side?

25:17.480 --> 25:20.160
I met a friend of
a friend at a bar.

25:20.240 --> 25:21.920
He heard what I did
for a living,

25:22.000 --> 25:24.160
knew I needed some cash.

25:24.240 --> 25:26.400
He said he thought we could
help each other out.

25:26.480 --> 25:28.240
If I got him some names
and card numbers,

25:28.320 --> 25:30.200
he'd pay me a good price.

25:30.280 --> 25:31.680
I knew it was a mistake.

25:31.760 --> 25:34.600
So you were doing it
to help your daughter?

25:34.680 --> 25:38.560
Would it be fair to say
that you would do
anything for her?

25:38.640 --> 25:41.040
Whatever it takes to make sure
you're there for her?

25:44.200 --> 25:45.840
Wait.

25:45.920 --> 25:48.520
You don't mean that
you think that
I'd kill for her?

25:48.600 --> 25:50.680
Charlie Taylor was on to you.

25:50.760 --> 25:52.640
He confronted you

25:52.720 --> 25:54.080
and told you he was going
to pass your name
on to the police.

25:54.160 --> 25:56.080
No.

25:56.160 --> 25:58.560
Which would mean you
were looking at a minimum
two-year sentence.

25:58.640 --> 26:01.640
How do you explain
that to a daughter who's
already lost her mother?

26:01.720 --> 26:03.480
I didn't kill Mr Taylor.

26:03.560 --> 26:05.640
I admit that he knew
what I'd been doing.

26:05.720 --> 26:07.600
And, yes,
he confronted me about it.

26:07.680 --> 26:09.160
But when I told
him about Carly,

26:09.240 --> 26:11.360
that I couldn't let her
see me go to prison...

26:12.240 --> 26:14.360
Well, he understood.

26:14.440 --> 26:16.600
He said he would make it
go away somehow.

26:17.840 --> 26:20.000
You have to believe me.

26:20.080 --> 26:22.240
Well, for now, I guess
we don't have a choice.

26:22.320 --> 26:25.080
Because currently
the only other person
who can corroborate your story

26:25.160 --> 26:27.840
is, unfortunately...dead.

26:35.720 --> 26:37.720
HUMPHREY: Well, you see,
that makes no sense at all.

26:37.800 --> 26:38.800
What's that, sir?

26:38.880 --> 26:40.280
Well, according to this,

26:40.360 --> 26:43.040
Brompton Cigarettes
ceased production in 1993.

26:43.120 --> 26:46.080
Which means that
these cigarettes we found
in Charlie's room

26:46.160 --> 26:48.280
are at least 24 years
out of date.

26:48.360 --> 26:52.600
Maybe he kept them
because they have
a personal attachment.

26:52.680 --> 26:54.640
A packet of old fags?

26:54.720 --> 26:57.360
Why were they there, Florence?
There has to be a reason.

26:58.360 --> 26:59.960
How are you getting on?

27:00.040 --> 27:02.080
Any further gen on our victim?

27:02.160 --> 27:06.320
It seems he spent most
of his time abroad employed
as an aid worker.

27:06.400 --> 27:08.320
Spent the last
three years in Sudan.

27:08.400 --> 27:11.960
And before that
he was working for Action
Against Hunger in Kenya.

27:12.040 --> 27:14.000
Crikey.

27:14.080 --> 27:16.080
Well, that's a bit more
involving than doing
a spot of "volunteering."

27:16.160 --> 27:19.400
Clearly a much more honourable
guy than his brother
led us to believe.

27:19.480 --> 27:21.800
Charlie Taylor was evidently
quite the altruist.

27:21.880 --> 27:23.800
Thank you very much, Tinicia.

27:23.880 --> 27:25.280
You've been very helpful.

27:25.360 --> 27:28.040
Yes. Bye-bye.

27:28.120 --> 27:30.320
-Chief, I've got something.
-Hit me with it, Dwayne.

27:30.400 --> 27:33.080
I've been going through
Mr Taylor's laptop.

27:33.160 --> 27:36.800
And I noticed he'd
exchanged some emails
with Jacob DeCosta.

27:36.880 --> 27:38.520
He's a local solicitor.

27:38.600 --> 27:40.320
Handled the probate
when my
grandparents passed away.

27:40.400 --> 27:42.440
And what were
he and our victim
communicating about?

27:42.520 --> 27:45.160
It seems it was Jacob
who wanted Mr Taylor
to come back home.

27:45.240 --> 27:48.000
And I quote, "His head
is buried in the sand.

27:48.080 --> 27:49.880
"I think it's time you came
and did your bit."

27:49.960 --> 27:52.040
I wonder who "he" is?
Elliot maybe?

27:52.120 --> 27:54.200
Well, that was
Jacob's secretary.

27:54.280 --> 27:57.200
And she said that Charlie
had been to their offices
yesterday afternoon.

27:57.280 --> 27:58.840
To meet with Mr DeCosta?

27:58.920 --> 28:00.160
He's out with clients
at the moment,

28:00.240 --> 28:02.480
but I managed to
get hold of Tinicia.

28:02.560 --> 28:03.560
Tinicia?

28:03.640 --> 28:05.360
Jacob's secretary.

28:05.440 --> 28:09.880
Me and her kinda hit it off
during the probate, you know.

28:09.960 --> 28:12.880
Anyway, I got her to
book me in for an early
appointment with him

28:12.960 --> 28:14.280
first thing tomorrow morning.

28:14.360 --> 28:15.640
Good work, Dwayne.

28:15.720 --> 28:18.000
Er, er, Chief,
I think you should know this.

28:18.080 --> 28:19.600
On the night he was killed,

28:19.680 --> 28:21.680
Charlie Taylor had booked
to fly back to the Sudan.

28:21.760 --> 28:23.360
There was an E-ticket
in his inbox.

28:23.440 --> 28:24.840
He was planning to leave?
When?

28:24.920 --> 28:26.120
First thing this morning.

28:26.200 --> 28:27.480
He was due on
the 7:00 a.m. flight.

28:27.560 --> 28:28.960
Really? How come no
one knew about this?

28:29.040 --> 28:31.320
It's strange he didn't
appear to tell anyone.

28:31.400 --> 28:32.960
Isn't it?

28:33.040 --> 28:36.040
And why all of a sudden
did he decide he needed to go?

28:36.120 --> 28:38.560
Something must have
prompted that decision.

28:38.640 --> 28:41.520
Anyway,
it's, erm, it's getting late.

28:41.600 --> 28:43.440
We need to get the boat back
before it gets dark.

28:46.520 --> 28:47.840
FLORENCE:
You should get off, sir.

28:47.920 --> 28:49.640
I'm sure Martha would
be glad to see you.

28:49.720 --> 28:51.080
Yes, it would be nice to
spend some time with her

28:51.160 --> 28:52.520
if you can manage without me.

28:52.600 --> 28:54.080
Right, I'll see you
all in the morning.

28:54.160 --> 28:55.360
-Chief.
-Bye.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.760
So, JP...

28:57.840 --> 29:00.000
You going home past
the florists this evening?

29:00.080 --> 29:01.280
Make things up with Rosey?

29:01.360 --> 29:03.080
Why? What's happened?

29:03.160 --> 29:06.440
JP's in the doghouse.
They had their
first row last night.

29:06.520 --> 29:10.320
Well, er, the thing is,
Dwayne, erm, I've been
thinking about your advice.

29:10.400 --> 29:12.760
And, while I'm
very grateful for it,

29:12.840 --> 29:14.920
and you're obviously very wise
with these things,

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
I don't want me and Rosey

29:17.080 --> 29:19.120
to be the kind of husband
and wife that don't
talk about our stuff.

29:19.200 --> 29:20.720
I want us to be
able to sit down

29:20.800 --> 29:22.960
and, you know,
work through our issues,
you know?

29:23.040 --> 29:24.120
Oh, man.

29:24.200 --> 29:25.440
(SCOFFS) Ignore him, JP.

29:25.520 --> 29:27.200
That sounds
very mature of you.

29:27.280 --> 29:29.520
OK. You do
as you please.

29:29.600 --> 29:31.000
But don't say
I didn't warn you.

29:45.160 --> 29:47.160
-Boo!
-Oh! (LAUGHS)

29:48.480 --> 29:49.960
Oh, good Lord.
Something's happened?

29:50.040 --> 29:52.640
Hello. I'm cooking, dinner.
For us.

29:52.720 --> 29:54.760
Yes, so I can see, erm...

29:54.840 --> 29:56.200
Gosh, you're messier
than I am.

29:56.280 --> 29:58.640
Oh, sorry.
Got a bit carried away.

29:58.720 --> 30:01.280
-But there is
method to the madness.
-Right!

30:01.360 --> 30:04.680
-Where did I put the parsley?
-Oh, er, the, er...

30:04.760 --> 30:07.360
Oh, erm, how's the case going?

30:07.440 --> 30:11.000
Erm, well, yes,
er, our murderer,
not unlike your parsley,

30:11.080 --> 30:12.560
is, er,
proving to be rather elusive.

30:12.640 --> 30:16.520
But, erm, we'll get
to the bottom of it, I'm sure.

30:18.680 --> 30:19.920
There's wine on the veranda.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.280
Why don't you go
and pour yourself a glass.

30:21.360 --> 30:24.040
Yes, I, I, I think
I'll leave you to it.

30:24.120 --> 30:26.160
-(SIGHS)
-Oh, OK.

30:35.040 --> 30:37.080
This is fantastic!

30:37.160 --> 30:39.480
Sorry about the ice bucket,
it's all you had.

30:39.560 --> 30:40.560
I love it. (CHUCKLES)

30:50.520 --> 30:51.840
Here we are.

30:51.920 --> 30:53.720
Wow!

30:53.800 --> 30:55.760
You don't mind lobster
two nights in a row?

30:55.840 --> 30:58.440
You can never have
too much lobster.
That's what I always say.

31:00.800 --> 31:02.800
So you been reading
a little local history?

31:02.880 --> 31:04.960
Yeah, I got it
from the library.

31:05.040 --> 31:09.320
That story about Cecile Dumas,
it's actually
really rather sad.

31:09.400 --> 31:11.480
The real reason
her husband
bought the island

31:11.560 --> 31:16.400
and built that house for her
wasn't some grand gesture
of romantic love.

31:16.480 --> 31:19.640
It was because he was
worried that she'd fallen
in love with another man.

31:19.720 --> 31:21.360
Really? So, he moved her
onto the island

31:21.440 --> 31:23.480
to try and keep her out
of temptation's way.

31:24.520 --> 31:26.120
Poor Cecile.

31:26.200 --> 31:27.960
Well, come on.

31:28.040 --> 31:29.560
Let's eat it
before it gets cold.

31:29.640 --> 31:31.160
Er, yeah, this is the, er,

31:31.240 --> 31:34.200
first time I've cooked
lobster so, be kind.

31:34.280 --> 31:36.360
-OK.
-Or, perhaps just be careful.

31:36.440 --> 31:38.280
OK. OK.

31:45.240 --> 31:47.400
Mmm, it's delicious.

31:47.480 --> 31:48.520
-Really?
-Really.

32:00.720 --> 32:03.000
-You all right, Humphrey?
-Hmm? Sorry?

32:03.600 --> 32:05.040
Yes.

32:05.120 --> 32:06.120
Couldn't be better.

32:09.000 --> 32:09.960
(CHUCKLES)

32:29.760 --> 32:30.720
(WHISTLING)

32:36.080 --> 32:38.040
-Morning, Dwayne.
-Ey, ey, ey...
What the blood...

32:38.120 --> 32:41.000
Things didn't go
quite as I'd planned
with Rosey.

32:41.080 --> 32:43.560
I, I just don't know
what went wrong.

32:43.640 --> 32:46.720
We sat down to discuss it
like proper grown-ups.

32:46.800 --> 32:48.560
I mean, we both agreed
that it was a silly argument

32:48.640 --> 32:50.280
and it should
never have happened.

32:50.360 --> 32:53.280
And the next thing,
it, it just happened again.

32:53.360 --> 32:55.120
-But I told you...
-I know.

32:55.200 --> 32:58.040
I know, OK.
You don't need to say it.

32:58.120 --> 32:59.480
I should have
just listened to you.

32:59.560 --> 33:01.720
Yes, JP, you should have.

33:01.800 --> 33:04.720
You forget I know
a thing or two
about a thing or two.

33:04.800 --> 33:08.200
That's why I'm not the one
standing there
without any clothes on.

33:08.280 --> 33:10.840
Now stop moping and
go and get dressed.

33:10.920 --> 33:13.280
We've got 15 minutes to get
to the solicitor's office

33:13.360 --> 33:15.920
and Tinicia does not
tolerate latecomers.

33:16.000 --> 33:16.960
So, hurry up!

33:18.360 --> 33:19.440
Go on now!

33:20.080 --> 33:21.040
OK.

33:27.440 --> 33:30.200
So, the post-mortem
came through
this morning, sir.

33:30.280 --> 33:32.320
It confirms the victim died

33:32.400 --> 33:35.720
from profuse internal bleeding
from a single stab
wound to the abdomen.

33:35.800 --> 33:37.840
And, I also heard
back from the lab.

33:37.920 --> 33:40.680
As we expected, they were
unable to recover
any prints from the knife.

33:41.840 --> 33:42.880
What do you think?

33:44.200 --> 33:45.240
Sir?

33:46.000 --> 33:47.480
Good.

33:47.560 --> 33:48.640
That's good, Florence.

33:54.320 --> 33:55.440
HUMPHREY:
What've you got there?

33:55.520 --> 33:56.880
Victim's phone.

33:56.960 --> 33:58.920
Dwayne said there were
quite a few photos on it.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.440
Thought I'd look through.

34:00.520 --> 34:01.920
Really. Anything of interest?

34:02.000 --> 34:03.800
A few from his travels.

34:03.880 --> 34:06.680
But mostly from when
he was here at the hotel.

34:06.760 --> 34:08.160
As a kid.

34:08.240 --> 34:09.920
Some of his parents.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.120
A lot of his brother.

34:12.200 --> 34:14.680
Yes, I can't help but sense
that Elliot feels a little
spurned by his brother.

34:14.760 --> 34:17.760
But I don't think that Charlie
necessarily felt the same,

34:17.840 --> 34:20.080
if he kept all those
photos of him.

34:20.160 --> 34:21.120
It's interesting.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.040
So, to recap.

34:24.120 --> 34:27.040
We have five
possible suspects.

34:27.120 --> 34:29.480
And now, unless
we find any evidence
to prove otherwise,

34:29.560 --> 34:32.640
our instinct is telling us
that Ernestine Gray
is not the killer.

34:32.720 --> 34:34.000
Which leaves us with...

34:34.080 --> 34:35.560
Elliot and Linda Taylor.

34:35.640 --> 34:36.960
HUMPHREY:
The owners of the hotel.

34:37.040 --> 34:38.440
Samuel Palmer.

34:38.520 --> 34:40.520
La Maison Cecile's
resident waiter and barman.

34:40.600 --> 34:41.600
And the receptionist.

34:41.680 --> 34:42.760
Irie Johnson.

34:42.840 --> 34:45.680
But just how did
one of them do it?

34:45.760 --> 34:48.400
When none of them were
seen sneaking up
or coming back down

34:48.480 --> 34:50.360
the one staircase leading up
to Mr Taylor's room.

34:50.440 --> 34:53.680
Just how, Florence?
How did they manage it?

34:53.760 --> 34:57.640
Sir, you should
take a look at this.

34:57.720 --> 35:00.400
HUMPHREY: Oh, that's Charlie,
right, as a teenager?

35:00.480 --> 35:02.360
It's not him you
should be looking at.

35:03.560 --> 35:05.120
Good Lord.

35:05.200 --> 35:07.160
Samuel Palmer. The waiter.

35:07.240 --> 35:08.720
He said he first met
Charlie Taylor

35:08.800 --> 35:10.560
when he started working here
two months ago.

35:10.640 --> 35:14.040
They clearly knew each other
when they were teenagers.

35:14.120 --> 35:17.400
That church
they're stood outside.
It's St Peter's.

35:17.480 --> 35:20.800
I'm sure that was the church
where the fire was started.

35:20.880 --> 35:21.920
Fire?

35:22.000 --> 35:24.520
Samuel Palmer's arson charge.

35:24.600 --> 35:26.400
Let me check the case file.

35:28.640 --> 35:30.560
I'm right.

35:30.640 --> 35:33.880
He set fire to
the community centre
attached to St Peter's Church.

35:33.960 --> 35:35.760
He was 16 at the time.

35:35.840 --> 35:38.440
Roughly about the
same age, I'd say,
he looks in this photo.

35:41.160 --> 35:42.360
Well done, Florence.

35:43.360 --> 35:45.240
When I started working here,

35:45.320 --> 35:47.760
Charlie didn't want
anybody knowing that
we used to be friends.

35:47.840 --> 35:49.080
Why not?

35:49.160 --> 35:50.800
Because he was as responsible

35:50.880 --> 35:54.400
for starting that
community centre fire
as I was.

35:54.480 --> 35:56.840
Only, he didn't get caught.

35:56.920 --> 36:00.320
You're saying you and Charlie
started the fire together?

36:00.400 --> 36:02.800
It was a stupid teenage prank
that went wrong.

36:02.880 --> 36:04.920
And you took the rap for him?

36:05.000 --> 36:09.080
When the police asked me
if anyone else
was involved, I said no.

36:09.160 --> 36:11.200
You served five years.

36:11.280 --> 36:12.560
That's quite a favour.

36:12.640 --> 36:14.360
He was my friend.

36:14.440 --> 36:16.720
He would've done
the same thing for me.

36:16.800 --> 36:19.240
Why did you start working here
after all this time?

36:19.320 --> 36:22.200
Let's say life
hasn't been too kind
these past few years.

36:22.280 --> 36:24.000
I heard Charlie was
back at the hotel,

36:24.080 --> 36:25.160
I came to him for help.

36:25.240 --> 36:26.680
For money?

36:26.760 --> 36:28.600
He said things
were a bit tight
at the moment.

36:28.680 --> 36:31.960
But he heard Elliot
saying they needed a new
hotel waiter and barman.

36:32.040 --> 36:33.960
Charlie suggested me.

36:34.040 --> 36:35.720
Said he had a recommendation.

36:35.800 --> 36:37.840
But without
letting anyone know
you used to be friends.

36:37.920 --> 36:40.320
He cared about people.

36:40.400 --> 36:43.000
And I could see it
still haunted him
what he did.

36:43.080 --> 36:45.040
Seeing me go off to prison.

36:47.360 --> 36:50.480
You want to know
why he kept it secret?

36:50.560 --> 36:52.880
It's because he felt
ashamed, Inspector.

36:54.480 --> 36:57.640
It must've cast quite a shadow
over your life.

36:57.720 --> 37:00.560
People don't often look
kindly on ex-offenders.

37:00.640 --> 37:02.080
What's your point?

37:02.160 --> 37:04.120
My point is your life
hasn't ended up too well,

37:04.200 --> 37:05.920
thanks to that
prison sentence.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.760
And all the guy who
you covered for
could offer in return

37:07.840 --> 37:09.640
was a job as a hotel waiter
and a barman.

37:09.720 --> 37:12.960
It's not exactly the greatest
of thank-you presents, is it?

37:13.040 --> 37:15.360
You think I stabbed Charlie
because I was angry

37:15.440 --> 37:18.800
that he had nothing more
to offer me than a job?

37:18.880 --> 37:21.400
You want to walk in
my shoes, Inspector.

37:21.480 --> 37:23.720
Then you might understand that
I have nothing but gratitude

37:23.800 --> 37:25.400
for what Charlie did for me.

37:28.160 --> 37:30.040
How long have you been
a smoker, Mr Palmer?

37:31.240 --> 37:32.880
Since I was 14 or so.

37:32.960 --> 37:34.920
And what about Charlie,
did he smoke back then?

37:35.000 --> 37:36.440
On and off.

37:36.520 --> 37:38.080
But he never
really took to it.

37:38.160 --> 37:39.800
His mother didn't approve,

37:39.880 --> 37:42.120
so he was always
too busy worrying
he'd get caught.

37:42.200 --> 37:43.200
Mmm-hmm.

37:45.240 --> 37:46.200
Thank you.

37:50.080 --> 37:51.440
FLORENCE:
So, what do you think, sir?

37:51.520 --> 37:53.440
Is Mr Palmer
telling the truth?

37:53.520 --> 37:55.320
Well, he seems
convincing enough, Florence.

37:55.400 --> 37:58.360
And if he is,
the picture he paints
of Charlie Taylor

37:58.440 --> 38:01.800
tallies with the one
Irie Johnson presents.

38:01.880 --> 38:04.400
That of a man with
a strong conscience.

38:04.480 --> 38:06.240
Now, Dwayne, JP, what news?

38:06.320 --> 38:09.560
So, we've just got back
from speaking
to Jacob DeCosta.

38:09.640 --> 38:12.320
And the reason Jacob had
been in communication
with Charlie Taylor

38:12.400 --> 38:14.240
in the last six months

38:14.320 --> 38:18.040
is because it turns out
this hotel is on the brink
of bankruptcy.

38:18.120 --> 38:20.560
And according to him
the business is
failing big time.

38:20.640 --> 38:24.360
And, Elliot has been
refusing to acknowledge
how serious it all is.

38:24.440 --> 38:26.320
So, Linda was
aware of the situation?

38:26.400 --> 38:28.240
Well, Mr DeCosta says

38:28.320 --> 38:29.760
she's no better than
her husband at dealing
with these things.

38:29.840 --> 38:31.680
She just does
whatever he says.

38:31.760 --> 38:33.720
That's why Jacob got
in contact with Charlie.

38:33.800 --> 38:35.440
Says he's more
level-headed and realistic

38:35.520 --> 38:37.080
when it comes to
the family business.

38:37.160 --> 38:38.920
And that's what
the meeting was
about yesterday?

38:39.000 --> 38:42.040
Jacob and Charlie have
arranged for the hotel
to go into liquidation.

38:42.120 --> 38:43.600
Charlie went to
pick up the paperwork

38:43.680 --> 38:45.880
to bring it back here
for him and Elliot to sign.

38:45.960 --> 38:49.000
HUMPHREY: So, that's what
was in the document folder
Charlie was carrying.

38:49.080 --> 38:52.320
But, if that's the case,
where are the documents now?

38:52.400 --> 38:54.480
Dwayne, JP,
I'd like you to search
Mr Taylor's office,

38:54.560 --> 38:55.720
see if you can
find those papers.

38:55.800 --> 38:57.160
Yes, Chief.

38:57.240 --> 38:59.560
Florence, let's go
and speak to the Taylors.

39:03.920 --> 39:05.520
-Mrs Taylor.
-Inspector.

39:08.160 --> 39:09.840
Where's your husband?

39:09.920 --> 39:12.320
Erm, he's, er, er,
gone to drop
some mail at the boat.

39:12.400 --> 39:13.400
He'll be back shortly.

39:15.360 --> 39:18.120
Is everything all right,
Mrs Taylor?
You seem edgy.

39:18.200 --> 39:21.320
I... I haven't slept well
over the past few nights,

39:21.400 --> 39:24.280
these, erm, help keep me calm.

39:24.360 --> 39:27.080
It's all been a bit,
bit tough going.
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

39:27.160 --> 39:28.240
Yes, yes. I can imagine.

39:28.320 --> 39:29.440
Elliot.

39:29.520 --> 39:31.640
It's all right, love.
I'm here.

39:33.320 --> 39:34.400
What's happening?

39:34.480 --> 39:35.880
We know, Mr Taylor.

39:35.960 --> 39:37.400
What do you mean, "We know"?
What do you know?

39:37.480 --> 39:38.960
Everything.

39:39.040 --> 39:41.600
We know that the hotel
is in financial trouble.

39:41.680 --> 39:43.440
We know Charlie
had returned to the island

39:43.520 --> 39:46.560
to convince you
to put the business
into liquidation.

39:46.640 --> 39:49.400
That's why he met
with your family
solicitor yesterday.

39:49.480 --> 39:50.960
-Sir.
-Yes.

39:51.040 --> 39:53.200
They were shoved in the bottom
of his waste-paper bin.

39:53.280 --> 39:54.280
Thank you, JP.

39:56.040 --> 39:57.560
Three separate copies.

39:57.640 --> 40:00.280
All signed and dated
by Charlie Taylor.

40:00.360 --> 40:02.400
And yourself.

40:02.480 --> 40:04.840
I imagine it wasn't quite
so hard for Charlie to
say goodbye to this place

40:04.920 --> 40:07.120
having been absent
for the last 20 years.

40:07.200 --> 40:09.720
But getting you to put
your signature
to these papers...

40:09.800 --> 40:11.960
I sense that would've taken
quite some doing.

40:12.040 --> 40:14.600
Three months
I've had of him
going on at me about it.

40:14.680 --> 40:16.360
Saying we don't have a choice.

40:16.440 --> 40:18.560
But you always have a choice.

40:18.640 --> 40:21.080
You can give up and go
or you can stay and fight on.

40:21.160 --> 40:23.600
Do you not think that maybe
all Charlie was trying
to do was help you?

40:23.680 --> 40:26.640
How can what he did be
seen as some sort of
act of kindness?

40:26.720 --> 40:28.560
As good as bullied
me into it, he did.

40:28.640 --> 40:30.920
Is that why he'd been
drinking last night?

40:31.000 --> 40:31.960
Dutch courage?

40:34.240 --> 40:35.200
So what happened next?

40:36.160 --> 40:38.120
Next?

40:38.200 --> 40:39.920
Well, he'd forced
your hand, literally,
into signing these papers.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.560
So what?

40:41.640 --> 40:43.880
You decided he wasn't gonna
have his way after all?

40:43.960 --> 40:46.600
You were gonna do whatever
you needed to
cling on to this hotel.

40:46.680 --> 40:49.960
What? No. I didn't kill him.

40:50.040 --> 40:52.400
He was my brother,
for Christ's sake!

40:52.480 --> 40:58.320
What my husband is trying
to say is that we
did not kill Charlie.

40:58.400 --> 41:00.720
But we did take
the documents from his room.

41:02.440 --> 41:04.520
When Charlie was found dead,

41:04.600 --> 41:09.120
I realised there was
an opportunity to stop
the liquidation going through.

41:09.200 --> 41:11.440
You didn't give me
all the keys to
Charlie's room, did you?

41:12.640 --> 41:15.000
Inspector,
the keys you asked for.

41:15.080 --> 41:17.640
I told her not to do it.

41:17.720 --> 41:20.240
ELLIOT: Later that night,
I went back to Charlie's room.

41:20.320 --> 41:22.920
It was stupid, I know.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.240
I thought if no one
ever finds them...

41:24.320 --> 41:26.200
No one would ever know
the papers were signed.

41:26.280 --> 41:29.600
La Maison Cecile
would live on to
fight another day.

41:29.680 --> 41:31.320
We could've got
through it, you know.

41:32.520 --> 41:33.560
This rough patch.

41:34.880 --> 41:36.560
Busy season's
just round the corner.

41:37.800 --> 41:39.880
We could survive,
I'm sure of it.

41:42.360 --> 41:44.240
HUMPHREY: So...
DWAYNE: Ow!

41:44.320 --> 41:45.440
We find ourselves presented

41:45.520 --> 41:47.240
-with four suspects.
-DWAYNE: Ow!

41:47.320 --> 41:49.800
All of whom had reason
to benefit from
Charlie Taylor's death.

41:49.880 --> 41:52.440
And all of whom
have lied to us

41:52.520 --> 41:54.160
in some way or another
over the past two days.

41:54.240 --> 41:55.560
So which one of them did it?

41:55.640 --> 41:57.320
Sorry Dwayne,
what are you doing?

41:57.400 --> 41:59.040
Sorry, Chief.

41:59.120 --> 42:01.000
I think I picked up a splinter
on the boat on the way over.

42:01.080 --> 42:02.840
I'm sorry to hear that
but maybe you could
deal with it later.

42:02.920 --> 42:04.600
Of course. Carry on, Chief.

42:04.680 --> 42:07.240
-HUMPHREY: Florence?
-All of the suspects
were downstairs

42:07.320 --> 42:10.040
at the time that the victim
was murdered upstairs,

42:10.120 --> 42:13.560
and as none of them
were seen using the only
possible means of access

42:13.640 --> 42:15.560
-to his bedroom...
-The staircase.

42:15.640 --> 42:19.120
Then there is nothing
to say that they are
not telling the truth.

42:19.200 --> 42:20.600
She's right, Chief.

42:20.680 --> 42:23.040
Yes, it's impossible,
isn't it?

42:23.120 --> 42:26.000
And you know the most
infuriating part of it all?

42:26.080 --> 42:29.560
I, I was there, I was there
the night it happened.

42:29.640 --> 42:31.200
We're not relying
on some second-hand,

42:31.280 --> 42:33.800
half-remembered statement
from a witness here.

42:33.880 --> 42:36.680
I, I was there
and I saw all four suspects

42:36.760 --> 42:39.000
down in the hallway after
the body had been found.

42:39.080 --> 42:41.000
Dwayne, please will you stop
picking at your finger.

42:41.080 --> 42:43.920
-It is so distracting.
-Sorry, Chief.

42:44.000 --> 42:48.480
It's... It's really hurting me
and I can't seem to
get the damn thing out.

42:48.560 --> 42:52.040
Sorry, it's me, it's me,
I'm not really myself today.

42:52.120 --> 42:53.920
I'm not my...

43:00.720 --> 43:01.680
Wait a minute...

43:02.640 --> 43:04.280
Sir?

43:04.360 --> 43:06.440
Tell me, if you would.

43:06.520 --> 43:07.760
What am I?

43:07.840 --> 43:09.600
What are you, Chief?

43:09.680 --> 43:11.360
I went into
the woods and got it.
I sat down to seek it.

43:11.440 --> 43:12.920
I brought it home because
I could not find it.

43:13.000 --> 43:14.400
-What am I?
-I don't know.

43:14.480 --> 43:15.920
A splinter!

43:16.000 --> 43:18.440
I'm a splinter!

43:18.520 --> 43:20.760
Good Lord, Dwayne.
Thank the heavens
for your splinter.

43:20.840 --> 43:22.400
Because if we use that
as a starting point,

43:22.480 --> 43:24.160
it suddenly all starts
to make sense.

43:24.240 --> 43:26.320
HUMPHREY: And I had full view
for the entire 10 minutes.

43:26.400 --> 43:27.920
ERNESTINE:
He came into the kitchen.

43:28.000 --> 43:29.160
LINDA:
Clearing up for the night.

43:29.240 --> 43:31.120
IRIE:
I was at the hotel reception.

43:31.200 --> 43:32.480
ELLIOT: I was in my office...
SAMUEL:
Down in the wine cellar.

43:32.560 --> 43:34.280
Someone put on
a wash for just one knife?

43:34.360 --> 43:36.480
HUMPHREY:
Looks like someone broke in.

43:36.560 --> 43:37.880
ERNESTINE:
What about his watch?

43:37.960 --> 43:39.640
HUMPHREY:
There's no wallet either.

43:39.720 --> 43:41.800
SAMUEL: He was always too busy
worrying he'd get caught.

43:41.880 --> 43:43.920
Why? I don't understand?

43:45.200 --> 43:46.680
Why? His phone...

43:46.760 --> 43:47.760
The photos.

43:47.840 --> 43:49.120
They're not there.

43:49.200 --> 43:50.280
Of course. That's why.

43:50.360 --> 43:52.160
They moved back
and got married.

43:52.240 --> 43:54.120
HUMPHREY: Around the same time
the victim moved away.

43:54.200 --> 43:55.920
Charlie became restless here.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.160
Like he was searching
for something
he couldn't find.

43:58.240 --> 43:59.760
HUMPHREY: Poor Cecile.

43:59.840 --> 44:01.280
MARTHA: The story is
actually really rather sad.

44:01.360 --> 44:02.600
Planned to leave? When?

44:02.680 --> 44:04.000
First thing this morning.

44:04.080 --> 44:05.600
Of course it was.

44:07.120 --> 44:08.840
It's all clear to me now.

44:08.920 --> 44:10.320
You know?

44:10.400 --> 44:12.280
Yes. I know.

44:12.360 --> 44:13.840
Shall we gather
everyone together, Chief?

44:13.920 --> 44:14.920
No!

44:15.840 --> 44:17.800
No, not this time.

44:17.880 --> 44:20.120
Perhaps it's better
if we deal with this
a little differently.

44:20.200 --> 44:22.320
I, I need to go
and check something
in the victim's bedroom first.

44:22.400 --> 44:24.080
Erm, er, Florence
if you wouldn't mind
coming with me.

44:24.160 --> 44:25.200
Of course, sir.

44:25.280 --> 44:26.520
Dwayne, JP.

44:26.600 --> 44:27.840
I need you to fetch someone.

44:27.920 --> 44:29.840
Who, Chief?

44:29.920 --> 44:31.800
The person who murdered
Charlie Taylor.

44:38.360 --> 44:39.400
Shall we?

44:57.800 --> 44:59.400
Please, sit down.

45:03.080 --> 45:04.160
What's going on?

45:05.320 --> 45:07.560
You killed Charlie Taylor.

45:07.640 --> 45:10.040
Oh, don't be absurd.
Of course I didn't.

45:10.120 --> 45:12.600
Please. We know what happened.

45:12.680 --> 45:14.640
I know you didn't
mean to do it.

45:14.720 --> 45:17.920
But you did nonetheless
murder your husband's
brother, didn't you?

45:19.080 --> 45:20.320
Oh, God.

45:22.520 --> 45:23.840
(SIGHS)

45:23.920 --> 45:26.320
I'm so, so sorry.

45:26.400 --> 45:27.840
It was one of my colleagues
getting a splinter

45:27.920 --> 45:30.160
in his finger that led me
to solving this case.

45:31.040 --> 45:33.040
A tiny little splinter

45:33.120 --> 45:36.720
made me alight upon
something I, I just hadn't
considered before.

45:36.800 --> 45:39.520
That a person can receive
an injury in one location

45:39.600 --> 45:42.960
and then carry it
with them to another.

45:43.040 --> 45:44.720
And therein lies the answer
to our riddle.

45:46.160 --> 45:48.520
Charlie was not
stabbed in this bedroom.

45:48.600 --> 45:51.080
He was stabbed downstairs
in the hotel kitchen.

45:53.160 --> 45:54.320
By you.

45:58.360 --> 46:01.160
You know, when I saw
him walking up that
staircase two nights ago,

46:01.240 --> 46:03.520
I assumed that
he was staggering
because he was drunk.

46:03.600 --> 46:06.080
When actually, the real
reason he was so
unsteady on his feet,

46:06.160 --> 46:09.600
was because he'd
sustained a fatal injury.

46:09.680 --> 46:12.400
Charlie proceeded
to his bedroom.

46:12.480 --> 46:16.080
And set about staging
the scene to look like
robbery gone wrong.

46:16.160 --> 46:18.200
But why?

46:18.280 --> 46:20.440
Why, when his life was ebbing
away, would he choose
to make everyone think

46:20.520 --> 46:25.400
that the person who wielded
that fatal blow was
someone other than you?

46:25.480 --> 46:28.960
We found some photos
on Charlie's phone.

46:29.040 --> 46:31.440
Something to remind him
of his past
here on the island.

46:32.040 --> 46:33.040
Family.

46:34.280 --> 46:35.240
Friends.

46:36.400 --> 46:37.920
Lots of his brother, Elliot.

46:39.400 --> 46:41.280
An awful lot.

46:41.360 --> 46:44.160
But not a single one of you.

46:44.240 --> 46:46.440
Almost like he was
trying to erase you
from his memory.

46:47.600 --> 46:49.280
During this investigation,

46:49.360 --> 46:52.320
no one we talked to could
seem to make much sense

46:52.400 --> 46:56.520
of why Charlie decided
to leave this
island 25 years ago.

46:56.600 --> 46:58.240
Charlie became restless here.

46:58.320 --> 47:01.080
He just got a bit
bored of it all.

47:01.160 --> 47:04.120
Like he was
searching for something
he couldn't find.

47:04.200 --> 47:06.120
I don't think either
of them were right.

47:06.200 --> 47:08.760
Charlie left this
island 25 years ago

47:08.840 --> 47:11.840
because that's
the very same time
you arrived on the island.

47:11.920 --> 47:15.840
We know that
after you and Elliot
graduated in Paris

47:15.920 --> 47:18.720
you came back to
La Maison Cecile
and got married.

47:18.800 --> 47:22.760
I hadn't met Charlie
before we moved
here from Paris.

47:22.840 --> 47:26.400
I hadn't even
visited the island.

47:26.480 --> 47:28.840
I can remember the
first time I saw him
standing on the jetty

47:28.920 --> 47:31.520
as the boat pulled in.

47:33.480 --> 47:35.080
And,

47:35.160 --> 47:37.200
I just knew,

47:37.280 --> 47:39.520
in that moment.
Straightaway.

47:41.960 --> 47:43.640
We both did, I think.

47:43.720 --> 47:45.680
That you were in love?

47:45.760 --> 47:48.320
We tried to ignore it.

47:48.400 --> 47:53.040
But the more you deny
something like that,
the more it consumes you.

47:54.320 --> 47:55.640
Yeah, I imagine
it must've broken

47:55.720 --> 47:57.760
both your hearts to have
to give each other up.

47:57.840 --> 48:00.160
But if that's what had to
be done to avoid Charlie
hurting his brother,

48:00.240 --> 48:01.280
betraying him,

48:03.160 --> 48:05.440
then, that's what he would do.

48:05.520 --> 48:07.760
If there's one
thing we've learnt
about Charlie Taylor,

48:07.840 --> 48:11.440
he was a man
driven by compassion.

48:11.520 --> 48:12.880
He understood.

48:12.960 --> 48:14.480
He cared about people.

48:14.560 --> 48:17.000
Charlie Taylor was evidently
quite the altruist.

48:17.080 --> 48:20.920
Which is why
when Jacob DeCosta
got in contact with Charlie

48:21.000 --> 48:25.680
and alerted him to
the dire financial
situation the hotel was in,

48:25.760 --> 48:28.800
Charlie realised that
his brother needed his help.

48:28.880 --> 48:31.480
So he came back.
We can't know
exactly what happened

48:31.560 --> 48:33.840
between you and him
these last few months.

48:35.560 --> 48:37.400
I assume you both
realised the love

48:37.480 --> 48:39.360
that was denied to you
all those years ago,

48:40.400 --> 48:42.160
was a strong as it ever was.

48:42.240 --> 48:45.840
We tried, we tried so hard.

48:45.920 --> 48:47.680
Which brings us
to the evening
of the murder.

48:50.040 --> 48:52.440
The reason Charlie
had been drinking
wasn't, as we thought,

48:52.520 --> 48:55.960
because of his having to
get Elliot to agree to sign
the liquidation papers.

48:56.040 --> 48:59.480
It was a Dutch courage
of a very different nature.

48:59.560 --> 49:01.480
We found out Charlie
had booked a flight

49:01.560 --> 49:05.040
to return to his work in Sudan
the very next morning.

49:05.120 --> 49:08.200
He knew that once he'd got
Elliot to sign the papers,

49:08.280 --> 49:12.040
it was time to force himself
to leave this island again

49:12.120 --> 49:14.800
and resume living life
without you in it.

49:14.880 --> 49:17.120
Charlie had been
drinking that night

49:17.200 --> 49:19.760
because he knew he had
something very hard to do.

49:19.840 --> 49:23.280
He had to say goodbye
to the only woman
he'd ever loved.

49:23.360 --> 49:25.400
I mean, that's why he was
in the state he was in.

49:25.480 --> 49:27.640
And I think, Charlie feeling
the worse for wear,

49:27.720 --> 49:30.240
entered the kitchen
that evening not because
he needed food.

49:30.320 --> 49:31.400
But to come and talk to you.

49:31.480 --> 49:33.160
To tell you he was leaving...

49:33.240 --> 49:35.040
I can't do this any more.

49:35.120 --> 49:38.080
And in that moment
your heart just
broke all over again.

49:38.160 --> 49:40.680
I, I imagine you tried
to convince him otherwise.

49:40.760 --> 49:44.360
Made what
desperate attempt you could
to make him not go.

49:44.440 --> 49:46.560
I think you'd realised that

49:46.640 --> 49:48.920
having spent the best part
of your life living on
an island stuck with a man

49:49.000 --> 49:50.880
you'd never really loved
in the first place,

49:50.960 --> 49:54.880
that you weren't ready
to give up on a chance
of true happiness.

49:54.960 --> 49:56.600
So, you begged him
to take you with him.

49:56.680 --> 49:58.400
FLORENCE: But he refused.

49:58.480 --> 50:00.520
It would mean
betraying his brother.

50:00.600 --> 50:02.560
Devastating him
with the revelation

50:02.640 --> 50:04.600
that his wife and brother

50:04.680 --> 50:08.360
had been secretly in love
with each other
since the day they met.

50:08.440 --> 50:11.160
See, we don't know
exactly what happened.

50:11.240 --> 50:14.040
But, somehow, somehow,
as he made to leave,

50:14.120 --> 50:16.080
to abandon you to
a life of misery,

50:17.480 --> 50:19.040
things got out of hand.

50:19.120 --> 50:21.480
It was the thought
of him walking away again,

50:21.560 --> 50:23.080
I don't know
what happened to me.

50:24.280 --> 50:26.560
I just got so angry.

50:26.640 --> 50:28.520
I'm leaving in the morning
and I'm not coming back.

50:28.600 --> 50:30.680
I reached for the knife
and I threatened him.

50:30.760 --> 50:32.320
No!

50:32.400 --> 50:35.480
I told him I'd make him
tell Elliot, if I had to.

50:35.560 --> 50:37.200
He tried to take
the knife off me,

50:37.280 --> 50:39.320
but I wouldn't
let him have it.

50:39.400 --> 50:41.480
I just thought that,
if I kept trying,

50:41.560 --> 50:47.040
if I, if I didn't give up,
I could convince
him not to leave me.

50:47.120 --> 50:48.680
(VOICE BREAKING)
And that's when it happened.

50:49.800 --> 50:51.040
Argh!

50:53.760 --> 50:57.120
(CRYING)
I didn't mean to,
but I stabbed him.

50:59.160 --> 51:01.200
It was in that moment he knew.

51:01.280 --> 51:03.880
He knew he had
only minutes left to live.

51:03.960 --> 51:08.200
By the time the paramedics
made their way out
on the boat, he'd be dead.

51:08.280 --> 51:10.040
And he knew the result
of you killing him

51:10.120 --> 51:11.720
would not only mean
the woman he loved
going to prison...

51:11.800 --> 51:13.160
But also...

51:13.240 --> 51:14.800
That his brother
would discover

51:14.880 --> 51:18.280
the one thing
Charlie never wanted
him to know.

51:18.360 --> 51:21.920
That his wife and
brother were in love.

51:22.000 --> 51:25.400
So, he decided to cover up
for what you'd done.

51:25.480 --> 51:29.240
HUMPHREY: I assume
he hid his injuries and
said he'd sort everything.

51:29.320 --> 51:30.960
Linda give me the knife.

51:31.040 --> 51:33.800
FLORENCE: He took the knife
and put the dishwasher on.

51:35.240 --> 51:38.280
It's gonna be OK.
I love you.

51:38.360 --> 51:40.480
FLORENCE:
He took the sandwich,
so everyone would assume

51:40.560 --> 51:42.160
that's why he'd
been in the kitchen.

51:42.240 --> 51:43.920
HUMPHREY: And when
he got back to his room...

51:44.000 --> 51:46.440
I think he knew
he didn't have long left.

51:46.520 --> 51:50.320
But all he cared about was
making sure that the truth
would never come out...

51:50.400 --> 51:51.720
(GLASS SHATTERING)

51:51.800 --> 51:54.400
Charlie was protecting
the woman he loved.

51:54.480 --> 51:56.560
To convince us that
whoever killed him

51:56.640 --> 51:58.520
had managed to get away,
he needed to make it look

51:58.600 --> 52:00.800
like the wallet and watch
had been stolen.

52:00.880 --> 52:05.240
I assume he also had to
get rid of whatever he'd
used to stem the blood.

52:05.320 --> 52:07.160
So, how did he achieve
this vanishing act?

52:10.560 --> 52:12.440
The answer lies with this.

52:12.520 --> 52:15.840
Since you'd known Charlie,
he'd never smoked,
you told me.

52:15.920 --> 52:17.840
You see, I later discovered
that he did once smoke,

52:17.920 --> 52:18.920
when he was younger.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.520
His mother didn't approve,

52:20.600 --> 52:23.000
so he was always too busy
worrying he'd get caught.

52:23.080 --> 52:27.560
So maybe these cigarettes were
a remnant of his brief spell
as a teenage smoker.

52:27.640 --> 52:30.400
If Charlie was
worried about his mum
finding out that he smoked,

52:30.480 --> 52:34.520
well then, maybe he had a
secret place where he used
to hide his cigarettes.

52:34.600 --> 52:36.200
And you know if he did,

52:36.280 --> 52:40.920
then maybe that's where he hid
the wallet and the watch.

52:43.080 --> 52:45.680
The packet was here
when I first found it.

52:45.760 --> 52:48.760
So if he'd taken it out to
make room for the items
he wanted to hide,

52:48.840 --> 52:50.800
then the secret hideaway
must be close by.

52:50.880 --> 52:53.000
There were spots of blood
here on the floor.

52:53.080 --> 52:56.840
Charlie must've left them
when he went to hide
the wallet and the watch.

52:56.920 --> 52:58.920
So, wherever he put them,

52:59.000 --> 53:02.200
must be somewhere...

53:05.840 --> 53:06.840
Near here.

53:12.240 --> 53:15.240
And here we have the final,
missing piece.

53:20.640 --> 53:22.520
Your scarf, I believe.

53:25.080 --> 53:27.840
But also,
the wallet and the watch.

53:31.680 --> 53:34.200
Even though
he must have been
crippled with pain,

53:34.280 --> 53:36.320
Charlie went out of
his way to lead us
away from the truth

53:36.400 --> 53:37.560
of what had happened.

53:37.640 --> 53:39.280
He did it
because he loved you.

53:39.360 --> 53:40.440
And he loved his brother.

53:41.920 --> 53:44.520
And he wanted to
protect you both.

53:44.600 --> 53:46.480
He knew he was gonna die.

53:46.560 --> 53:47.960
But if he could die

53:48.040 --> 53:50.040
knowing that the truth
would not be discovered,

53:50.120 --> 53:53.280
then at least he could die
with some sense of peace.

53:53.360 --> 53:55.640
He was that close
to achieving it.

53:55.720 --> 53:58.040
If it wasn't for
an out-of-date
packet of cigarettes.

54:01.320 --> 54:03.200
Mrs Taylor, I'm afraid
we will have to arrest you.

54:03.280 --> 54:04.400
I, I'm sorry.

54:05.840 --> 54:07.080
I think it's unavoidable

54:07.160 --> 54:10.320
that your husband will
find out what happened.

54:10.400 --> 54:14.840
If you want to
take a few minutes,
to tell him yourself...

54:16.800 --> 54:18.280
Thank you, Inspector.

54:32.080 --> 54:33.200
Fancy a beer?

54:33.280 --> 54:34.280
Huh?

54:34.360 --> 54:35.360
I better not.

54:37.440 --> 54:40.600
I think I'm going to buy them
flowers for Rosey.

54:40.680 --> 54:42.920
So you've finally decided
to take my advice, huh?

54:43.840 --> 54:44.800
Uh...

54:45.480 --> 54:46.600
I guess so.

54:49.840 --> 54:50.920
Hey.

54:52.480 --> 54:55.040
What's the problem?

54:55.120 --> 54:57.760
Look, I just don't want it
to feel like I'm saying sorry

54:57.840 --> 54:59.600
to, to have an easy life,
you know?

54:59.680 --> 55:01.360
Then when you say it, mean it.

55:01.440 --> 55:03.480
And, the next time
you and Rosey have a row,

55:03.560 --> 55:06.480
maybe she'll be
the one to apologise.

55:06.560 --> 55:08.560
It's give and take.

55:08.640 --> 55:10.200
Isn't that what they say
about a good marriage?

55:10.280 --> 55:11.280
Huh?

55:12.240 --> 55:13.680
Yes.

55:13.760 --> 55:15.840
You're right. They do.

55:15.920 --> 55:18.280
Well then. There you go.

55:19.760 --> 55:22.760
-Thank you, Dwayne.
-Any time.

55:22.840 --> 55:24.840
And they ask me
why I never got married...

55:34.880 --> 55:36.240
Well done, sir.

55:36.320 --> 55:38.640
That wasn't easy,
what you had to do today.

55:41.120 --> 55:42.600
Night, Florence.

55:46.680 --> 55:47.720
Sir.

55:50.200 --> 55:51.920
I hope you don't
mind me asking.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.560
But you haven't quite
seemed yourself today.

55:56.000 --> 55:57.480
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

55:57.560 --> 55:59.520
In truth, Florence,

55:59.600 --> 56:01.880
well, you see something
really rather awful
appears to have happened.

56:01.960 --> 56:03.560
What?

56:03.640 --> 56:05.680
Last night,
I was having dinner
with Martha and,

56:05.760 --> 56:10.560
and I realised that...
That I love her.

56:12.360 --> 56:16.320
-And that's a bad thing?
-Well, yes it is, rather.

56:16.400 --> 56:19.360
Because any day now,
she's gonna leave
my life forever.

56:19.440 --> 56:21.560
So what are you going to do?

56:21.640 --> 56:24.520
As seems to be my way
with affairs of the heart,
Florence...

56:26.640 --> 56:27.960
I haven't a clue.

56:36.160 --> 56:37.280
I haven't a clue.

56:53.040 --> 56:56.200
SELWYN: Here in the Caribbean,
cricket is in our blood.

56:56.280 --> 56:58.080
HUMPHREY: Jerome Martin, 45...

56:58.160 --> 57:00.280
FLORENCE:
Found dead in the middle
of Honore Cricket pitch

57:00.360 --> 57:02.240
having been shot in the heart.

57:02.320 --> 57:04.840
I loved my husband
a great deal.
Despite everything he'd done.

57:04.920 --> 57:06.240
This was meant to
be a holiday romance.

57:06.320 --> 57:07.920
Until I stupidly
fell in love with her.

57:08.000 --> 57:09.880
JP: But, I'm your partner.

57:09.960 --> 57:12.560
This really big thing
about your past and
I have no idea about it.

57:12.640 --> 57:14.680
Chief, come on, airport!

57:14.760 --> 57:16.160
That's it! That's her plane!

57:16.240 --> 57:17.480
Go! Go!

57:19.000 --> 57:21.080
