Well, what's your plan?

16:45.843 --> 16:49.183
Maybe take the bus to the beach.
Hike the canyon. I haven't decided yet.

16:49.266 --> 16:52.147
Maybe that's what we all need--
a day off.

16:53.776 --> 16:57.074
What? You were just telling me how
it's getting all claustrophobic in here.

16:58.786 --> 17:01.290
-Thanks for that, man.
-No, but you're right.

17:01.374 --> 17:04.046
We could all use a break, a day off.
You know, just--

17:04.128 --> 17:06.175
And then tomorrow we can
decide what's next.

17:09.473 --> 17:11.185
Wilder, what are you gonna do
with a day off?

17:12.396 --> 17:14.526

in your head?

with these adorable balloons?

17:47.341 --> 17:49.846
Twenty years from now we're gonna be
watching this at Xerxes' wedding,

is your spat with mini-Wilder

to "I don't wanna see you, either."

before I could tell you about Darius.

18:01.077 --> 18:02.287
You got nothing to say to us.

18:02.371 --> 18:04.208
Livvie, you think someone set him up,
and I think you're right.

18:04.291 --> 18:07.548
It was my parents and their
shady-ass organization, PRIDE.

-As shit.

18:09.844 --> 18:11.765

my dad killed him.

he didn't make his flight.

is if I saw the guy who shot at us,

21:56.380 --> 21:59.386
and the answer is yes.
He's a guy from our neighborhood.

His name is Anthony something.
I don't know. He goes by AWOL.

who could use your help.

on about, he's a cop now.

was killed at the Gordon Hotel,

so if I can hack into the surveillance
system there and prove it,

my dad to jail for good

once and for all.

24:00.044 --> 24:02.090

24:02.173 --> 24:03.718

24:48.683 --> 24:50.645
He's been seeing Tamar's sister.

and her newborn, because yes, Cat,

28:54.173 --> 28:55.300
Try it.

28:56.762 --> 28:58.516
If this is some ploy
to get me into bed--

28:58.599 --> 29:01.270
Just onto the bed, OK?

29:01.354 --> 29:04.653
You've had a really long day,
and this is gonna take a while.

29:04.736 --> 29:06.782
I'm telling you,
those pillows are no joke.

29:17.887 --> 29:19.098
See what I'm saying?

29:24.776 --> 29:27.991
Do you think anyone would notice
if I took these home with us?

29:28.074 --> 29:30.036
CHASE: Lace will tear 'em up
in a heartbeat.

29:30.120 --> 29:33.753
Oh, just cause she chewed
a little bit on your boot does--

29:33.836 --> 29:35.840
-What are you doing?
-CHASE: Using your bag for our stash.

29:35.923 --> 29:38.386
I don't really wanna see what happens
when chocolate-fondued fruit

29:38.470 --> 29:40.015
gets mixed in with the Fistigons.

29:40.098 --> 29:42.269
Oh, no, no. I-- I have stuff in there.

29:47.196 --> 29:48.281
Hi.

29:49.408 --> 29:51.997
I was gonna tell you
about that. Probably.

29:52.749 --> 29:55.378
I'm applying to colleges.

29:55.462 --> 29:58.301
The school of my dreams.
Et cetera.

29:58.384 --> 30:00.723
-And you didn't say anything?
-I--

30:00.807 --> 30:02.519
Haven't really said
anything to you lately.

30:02.602 --> 30:05.983
You haven't-- You've barely spoken
to me since the hospital.

30:06.067 --> 30:07.277
Yeah, because I was pissed.

30:07.361 --> 30:09.699
You kept something huge from me,
and here we are again.

30:11.035 --> 30:13.164
[beep, door opens]

30:13.248 --> 30:14.793
Come on.

30:26.023 --> 30:27.359
CHASE:
We should stay in here.

30:27.442 --> 30:28.696
GERT:
No, we have to go out there. Put a--

30:28.779 --> 30:30.783
-COORDINATOR: Hello?
-CHASE: No, I don't want to.

30:30.867 --> 30:33.037
Hi! Hi, sorry.

30:33.371 --> 30:35.125
Um, don't mind us.
We're just--

30:35.208 --> 30:36.879
We're on the first night
of our honeymoon.

30:36.962 --> 30:40.051
I am so sorry. We weren't
expecting you for another hour.

30:40.135 --> 30:41.555
Let us make it up to you.

30:41.638 --> 30:43.642
Can I bring you anything?
A bottle of Dom?

30:43.726 --> 30:46.355
We could use something.
A good divorce lawyer.

30:46.439 --> 30:48.443
OK. Honey, your timing is a little--

30:48.527 --> 30:50.823
No, really. Two hours in,
and she's talking about leaving.

30:50.907 --> 30:53.119
OK, I'm not talking
about leaving you.

30:53.202 --> 30:55.625
And also, you wouldn't even want
to move to Massachusetts.

30:55.708 --> 30:57.044
How do you know?
How do you know what I want?

30:57.127 --> 30:59.089
Well, for starters,
it's an all-girls school.

30:59.173 --> 31:01.302
You know, I should, uh, really go.

31:01.385 --> 31:04.016
She never actually asks me what I want,
or if I can handle something.

31:04.099 --> 31:07.189
You make a decision,
you lie, and then you keep shit from me.

31:07.272 --> 31:09.861
It's like with the hospital.
You could've told me what was going on.

31:09.945 --> 31:13.869
But no, instead you screwed me over,
and you outed me to my mom.

31:16.917 --> 31:19.088
Happy honeymooning.
[chuckles awkwardly]

31:22.177 --> 31:23.639
GERT:
Thank you so much!

31:31.822 --> 31:35.412
I know. Juvenile.
But you know what else?

31:37.165 --> 31:38.376
Totally worth it.

31:53.574 --> 31:55.410
Hey, Vaughn. Long time no see.

31:55.493 --> 31:58.249
Karolina?
Oh, thank the Spectrum.

31:58.332 --> 32:00.045
We've been worried sick.

32:00.128 --> 32:03.426
There were rumors. Terrible rumors.

32:03.510 --> 32:06.725
Talk that you, you know,
lost the Light.

32:06.808 --> 32:09.898
And there was that whole thing
about murder and kidnapping.

32:09.981 --> 32:11.610
But I know that wasn't true.

32:12.695 --> 32:14.741
I just needed a little time away.

32:18.957 --> 32:21.170
But I think I left something
in Jonah's office.

32:21.922 --> 32:24.803
And you need help getting in
without fielding a hundred questions

32:24.886 --> 32:27.390
from random congregants.
I get it.

32:27.474 --> 32:30.063
Right. So, do you
think you can help?

32:30.146 --> 32:34.404
Of course. But I'm not sure
you'll find what you're looking for.

32:34.488 --> 32:37.369
That guy, Jonah,
he's left for another European tour.

32:37.452 --> 32:39.874
His things are being packed up
and shipped to him.

32:45.260 --> 32:46.680
[panting]

32:52.399 --> 32:53.610
Is everything OK in there?

32:56.741 --> 32:57.827
God! Yeah.

32:57.910 --> 33:00.248
Yeah, that didn't sound OK.
Should I come in there?

33:00.331 --> 33:03.755
No, no, no! I'm fine.
I need you to watch out for, uh--

33:04.632 --> 33:05.885
I'm good in here.

33:14.234 --> 33:16.197
-Karolina...
-KAROLINA: I'm fine.

33:16.280 --> 33:18.619
Just...

33:18.702 --> 33:20.623
I thought there would be something.

33:22.042 --> 33:25.925
A piece of him, of our family--
but there's nothing.

33:27.511 --> 33:29.849
No photos, no journal, just nothing.

33:31.477 --> 33:33.899
I don't get it.
How could you just...be gone.

33:33.982 --> 33:35.945
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Wizey voice activation.

33:36.028 --> 33:37.489
What? Karolina, I couldn't hear you.

33:37.573 --> 33:41.748
-Vaughn, shh!
-Karolina Dean. Message activated.

33:50.181 --> 33:53.981
JONAH ON RECORDING:
Karolina, if you're hearing this,

33:54.064 --> 33:57.279
it means your mother never
gave me the chance to know you.

33:57.362 --> 33:59.534
And I so badly wanted to know you.

34:00.703 --> 34:03.457
To tell you my side of the story.

34:03.542 --> 34:06.463
Every child deserves to know their father.

34:10.471 --> 34:13.770
There's gotta be um, like a laundry room
or a break room down here.

34:14.938 --> 34:17.402
Maybe there's a vending machine.
I still got some quarters.

34:17.485 --> 34:19.657
We can get you
those sour things you like.

34:21.703 --> 34:22.788
Or not.

34:25.376 --> 34:27.922
You know, I think Gert was right.

34:28.007 --> 34:29.677
You gotta talk about it.

34:31.806 --> 34:33.893
I shouldn't have the staff.

34:36.023 --> 34:38.570
I'm not the right person
to have this kind of power.

34:39.822 --> 34:42.284
And I shouldn't be able
to lift a truck over my head.

34:42.369 --> 34:46.585
But...we can make the world safer,

34:46.668 --> 34:49.007
better, with our powers.

34:49.091 --> 34:50.803
They're a gift.

34:52.472 --> 34:53.641
COORDINATOR:
Oh, my God.

34:53.725 --> 34:55.978
This is so weird.
I was setting up the honeymoon suite,

34:56.063 --> 34:57.775
and our honeymooners
had already checked in.

34:57.858 --> 34:59.444
Then I just got a call
from the newlyweds

34:59.529 --> 35:02.033
saying their flight had been delayed...
in Denver.

35:02.117 --> 35:03.578
GUARD:
Shit. LAPD called us earlier

35:03.662 --> 35:04.872
and told us to watch out

35:04.956 --> 35:06.710
for a group of teenagers
that might show up here.

35:06.793 --> 35:08.505
-Apparently, these kids are dangerous.
-We gotta go.

35:08.588 --> 35:10.091
We gotta go. Now!

35:22.282 --> 35:23.827
[computer beeps]

35:25.748 --> 35:27.459
Guys, I'm in!

35:27.543 --> 35:28.754
Hey! I'm in.

35:31.467 --> 35:33.597
Someone got comfortable.

35:33.680 --> 35:36.435
Trust me, it was necessary
for the mission. Otherwise--

35:36.519 --> 35:38.272
Do you want me to throw something
of yours into the chocolate?

35:38.355 --> 35:39.984
I hear Fistigons pair very nicely.

35:40.067 --> 35:41.403
Oh, wait, there.
Play it. It's Darius.

35:41.487 --> 35:42.907
Oh wait, you found him?
Let me see.

35:46.831 --> 35:48.877
No. No, it can't be gone.

35:48.960 --> 35:50.881
Of course PRIDE would Nixon
the shit out of this.

35:50.964 --> 35:52.885
No, there's gotta be another feed, OK?
Something.

35:52.968 --> 35:56.016
There's gotta be another way
to prove that my dad was here.

35:57.018 --> 35:58.395
What about the other cameras?

35:58.479 --> 35:59.982
There are boutiques downstairs.

36:00.066 --> 36:03.155
Anyone who came in would have to
go through the lobby, so they probably--

36:03.239 --> 36:05.034
They have their own cameras. Yes!

36:05.117 --> 36:08.165
Wow, way to steal the credit
right out of the girl's mouth.

36:08.249 --> 36:10.086
The man-terruption phenomenon
in action.

36:10.169 --> 36:11.171
Or he was just being cute
and finishing her--

36:11.255 --> 36:12.257
Don't start with me.

36:13.425 --> 36:16.181
OK, here we go. All right,
anyone walking through the lobby

36:16.265 --> 36:17.433
will have had to have passed
through this window.

36:17.518 --> 36:18.687
[rewinding]

36:20.607 --> 36:22.485
Detective Flores--
the cop on PRIDE's payroll.

36:22.570 --> 36:24.949
And AWOL--
the guy who shot at us today.

36:25.032 --> 36:26.410
Looks like they're waiting
for someone.

36:26.493 --> 36:30.126
Yeah, my dad. Let's make sure
we got it on tape, then we can go.

36:32.756 --> 36:34.844
GERT:
Holy shit. Alex.

36:34.927 --> 36:36.514
CHASE:
It wasn't your dad.

36:36.598 --> 36:38.100
GERT:
It was your mom.

36:39.645 --> 36:41.524
[dog barking]

36:57.221 --> 36:59.351
-[sighs]
-[doorbell rings]

37:04.987 --> 37:09.120
Nana B, it's me, Geoffrey...Wilder.

37:10.791 --> 37:12.085
[Xerxes crying]

37:12.168 --> 37:14.674
I know who you are.
The hell are you doing here?

37:14.757 --> 37:16.218
I came to see Tamar. Is she--

37:16.301 --> 37:19.892
She's not comin' anywhere near you.
Not after what you did.

37:19.976 --> 37:21.646
TAMAR:
Leave him alone, Nana B.

37:24.109 --> 37:25.779
I told him he can come here.

37:28.158 --> 37:29.369
I'll be with the baby.

37:37.928 --> 37:39.222
What do you want?

37:39.305 --> 37:41.728
The deal I made with Darius
was straight.

37:43.147 --> 37:45.944
Now, that property's all yours, Tam.

37:46.028 --> 37:48.867
I can't take back what happened,
but I can make sure that his family--

37:50.620 --> 37:52.833
your family is taken care of.

38:01.809 --> 38:03.980
Put in a little somethin' extra
for the baby.

38:04.064 --> 38:07.153
Look, I know you have no reason
to believe me,

38:07.236 --> 38:09.199
but I am sorry for all of it.

38:10.284 --> 38:12.121
D always called me his queen.

38:14.877 --> 38:17.340
He said someday he'd even
give me my own kingdom.

38:19.970 --> 38:23.310
This deal was...

38:23.393 --> 38:25.439
it was supposed
to be the start of something.

38:28.655 --> 38:32.453
You may think this
makes us straight, G...

38:32.538 --> 38:34.124
but I'm just gettin' started.

38:37.714 --> 38:40.637
I'm gonna build my own
goddamn kingdom now.

38:42.891 --> 38:44.227
So you better watch your back.

38:56.627 --> 38:58.172
[inner door slams]

39:04.017 --> 39:08.735
Ladies, as I'm sure you're aware, we--
the three of us--

39:08.818 --> 39:10.906
are the most devout members
of this church.

39:12.701 --> 39:14.078
What do you want, Frank?

39:15.372 --> 39:19.422
I'm calling on your inner Light
to help me. To help the church.

39:23.388 --> 39:24.474
[both gasp]

39:25.267 --> 39:26.436
FRANCES:
Who is that?

39:26.520 --> 39:27.940
AURA:
I don't recognize him.

39:28.023 --> 39:30.779
He's not a member of the church,
and too old to be a runaway.

39:30.862 --> 39:34.202
FRANK:
He's not. He's an innocent man

39:34.285 --> 39:36.707
whose life Leslie took, recklessly.

39:38.210 --> 39:41.299
Aura, Frances, we have a problem.

39:43.220 --> 39:45.307
And its name is Leslie Ellerh Dean.

39:49.733 --> 39:51.444
JONAH ON RECORDING:
Before the man you met,

39:51.529 --> 39:54.450
I lived as many men.

39:54.535 --> 39:57.791
I watched cities rise,
religions form, technology advance.

39:59.127 --> 40:00.964
It was a lonely existence,

40:01.047 --> 40:02.926
waiting for your world
to catch up with mine,

40:03.010 --> 40:07.184
so my family, our family,
could be freed.

40:08.061 --> 40:11.401
But when you were born, my dear,
I felt a connection

40:11.484 --> 40:14.658
far deeper
than anything I had ever experienced.

40:14.742 --> 40:16.829
I could not bear to lose it.

40:16.912 --> 40:18.541
The sacrifices that you discovered

40:18.624 --> 40:21.421
were done so that
I could stay in this form,

40:21.505 --> 40:23.718
stay as your father.

40:23.801 --> 40:28.018
To struggle with another host,
risk losing you forever--

40:28.101 --> 40:30.189
I couldn't do it.

40:30.272 --> 40:33.487
Maybe you can't forgive this,
but Karolina,

40:33.571 --> 40:36.952
you have a destiny
that is bigger than all of us.

40:39.123 --> 40:40.960
In inhabiting this human body,

40:41.044 --> 40:44.300
I have learned to love none
more than you.

40:45.302 --> 40:47.849
Carry this with you as you
prepare for what's next.

40:55.030 --> 40:56.032
What are you still doing here?!

40:56.116 --> 40:57.577
MOLLY:
Didn't you get, like, our ten texts?

40:57.661 --> 40:59.497
-We gotta go now!
-Come on!

41:03.338 --> 41:04.382
Alex, come on.

41:15.530 --> 41:18.578
-[elevator bell rings]
-Stairs! Go!

41:29.223 --> 41:31.019
[whoosh]

41:34.400 --> 41:36.279
That's not gonna hold 'em.

41:39.160 --> 41:40.370
GERT:
Molly, come on!

41:40.454 --> 41:42.918
Go! I'll meet you at the Rolls.
Go!

41:51.434 --> 41:52.562
[lock rattling]

41:52.604 --> 41:54.633
[guards shouting]

42:01.454 --> 42:03.083
[grunting]

42:13.395 --> 42:15.440
MOLLY: Are you guys really gonna
lock me in a dungeon?

42:15.525 --> 42:17.319
I mean, do you see me? I'm 14.

42:35.480 --> 42:36.567
Sit down, girl.

42:45.585 --> 42:48.758
Hi, Molly.
So nice to finally meet you.

43:41.028 --> 43:42.782
[pencil scratching]
