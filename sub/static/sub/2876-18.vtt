00:07.383 --> 00:10.344
Monica?
Hey, can I borrow the Porsche?

00:10.511 --> 00:12.263
- Okay.
- All right!

00:12.430 --> 00:14.849
But, uh, ahem, what is it not?

00:15.433 --> 00:18.436
A place to entertain my lady friends.

00:19.020 --> 00:23.524
- And what else is it not?
- A place to eat spaghetti.

00:24.191 --> 00:25.234
- Very good.
- Thanks.

00:25.401 --> 00:28.988
- What do you need it for anyway?
- The, uh, lottery is up to 300 million...

00:29.196 --> 00:33.659
- ...and they don't sell tickets here.
- So you're driving up to Connecticut?

00:33.826 --> 00:37.038
Yeah, Connecticut.
Not West Virginia.

00:38.622 --> 00:41.876
Maybe I'll drive you up there.
I'd like to buy some tickets myself.

00:42.251 --> 00:46.464
Yeah, with Chandler not getting paid,
we could really use $300 million.

00:46.630 --> 00:51.552
Yes, because if I was at my old job,
we'd say, "300 million? No, thank you."

00:53.387 --> 00:55.473
- Will you get me tickets too?
- Yeah, me too.

00:55.639 --> 00:57.349
- Sure.
- Ooh! I have an idea.

00:57.516 --> 01:00.770
Why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks,
we'll pool our money together...

01:00.936 --> 01:04.647
- ...and then if we win, we'll split it.
- That's a great idea!

01:05.191 --> 01:07.526
No, thanks.

01:08.194 --> 01:10.529
- You don't want to win the lottery?
- Uh, sure I do.

01:10.696 --> 01:12.698
I also want to be king
of my own country...

01:12.865 --> 01:15.659
...and find out what happened
to Amelia Earhart.

01:16.243 --> 01:19.413
- Still on Amelia Earhart?
- The woman just vanished!

01:21.123 --> 01:22.917
Seriously, you don't want in on this?

01:23.125 --> 01:26.045
No. Do you know what your odds
are of winning the lottery?

01:26.212 --> 01:29.840
I mean, you have a better chance
of being struck by lightning 42 times.

01:30.049 --> 01:33.219
But there's six of us, so we'd
only have to get struck 7 times.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.596
I like those odds!

01:36.388 --> 01:40.309
Seriously, you guys, I can't believe
you're gonna spend $250 on the lottery.

01:40.476 --> 01:43.729
I mean, that's such a bunch
of boo-hockey.

01:47.066 --> 01:48.984
I'll ask.

01:49.735 --> 01:51.237
"Boo-hockey"?

01:52.196 --> 01:54.365
Oh, we think Emma's about
to start talking...

01:54.532 --> 01:58.160
...so we're trying to be careful about
what words we use in front of her.

01:58.369 --> 02:00.538
So get ready to hear a lot
of, uh, boo-hockey...

02:00.704 --> 02:03.290
...gosh darn it
and brother pucker.

02:04.959 --> 02:06.919
How do you know
she's gonna start talking?

02:07.128 --> 02:10.381
When I talk to her, I almost feel
like she understands what I'm saying.

02:10.548 --> 02:13.008
Kind of like Joey.

02:14.176 --> 02:16.220
What's that now?

03:09.440 --> 03:13.068
God, look at all these tickets.
It's so exciting.

03:13.277 --> 03:15.237
I haven't won anything
since sixth grade.

03:15.446 --> 03:17.740
Pie-eating contest?

03:19.575 --> 03:23.078
You assume because I was heavy that's
the only way I could win something?

03:23.287 --> 03:26.290
No, I saw a picture
of you covered in blueberries.

03:26.498 --> 03:29.335
- That was a good day.
- Yeah.

03:29.919 --> 03:33.881
- They're towing your car!
- I'm parked in a garage on Morton.

03:34.715 --> 03:37.301
They're towing a car.

03:37.468 --> 03:41.180
And I am seeing spots.

03:41.388 --> 03:44.058
Ross, you don't have Emma!
Rachel, you don't have Emma!

03:44.225 --> 03:46.644
- Where's Emma? Who has Emma?
- Joey, relax.

03:46.810 --> 03:51.106
My mother picked her up two hours ago.
You were there.

03:52.107 --> 03:54.902
- I was?
- Yes, and you talked to her.

03:55.319 --> 03:58.405
- I did?
- She dropped off a casserole.

03:58.614 --> 04:01.575
Oh, yeah, the casserole lady.

04:01.867 --> 04:04.161
Did you come by to watch
us win the big bucks?

04:04.370 --> 04:07.915
Yeah. And then I figured after you win,
we can all go out to the balcony...

04:08.082 --> 04:11.627
...and see a night rainbow
with gremlins dancing on top of it.

04:13.629 --> 04:16.005
Don't touch the phone!
I'll get it! I'll get it!

04:16.464 --> 04:19.093
- You think he washed his hands?
- Hello?

04:19.301 --> 04:21.637
- Hey, Charlie, what do you know?
- What's going on?

04:21.845 --> 04:25.057
Chandler's supposed to find out if he's
getting a job at his agency.

04:25.224 --> 04:27.643
But out of 15 interns,
they're only hiring three.

04:27.851 --> 04:29.645
- Ooh. Tough odds.
- Yeah.

04:29.853 --> 04:33.607
If only it were a sure thing
like your 24-state lottery.

04:34.650 --> 04:38.445
Yeah, look who's coming around!

04:38.654 --> 04:42.366
Damn it. All right, call me
when you know more.

04:43.701 --> 04:46.578
- Did you get it?
- One of the slots got filled.

04:47.079 --> 04:51.500
- By you?
- Sense the tone.

04:52.793 --> 04:56.338
- No, that kid Nate got it.
- Oh, I hate that guy.

04:56.505 --> 04:59.758
- I mean, come on, pull up your pants!
- I know.

04:59.925 --> 05:01.802
Well, there's two spots left, right?

05:02.011 --> 05:04.638
Yeah. I mean, I want this so much.
I want to get one.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.016
I want my friend Charlie
to get one.

05:07.182 --> 05:09.268
Except I don't care about Charlie.

05:11.145 --> 05:12.229
Hey!

05:12.396 --> 05:15.149
You are not gonna believe this.
I just saw my psychic...

05:15.316 --> 05:19.194
...and she said I was definitely
gonna win the lottery tonight!

05:20.571 --> 05:22.656
I thought we could use
some extra luck...

05:22.823 --> 05:24.867
...so I brought a wishbone home
from work.

05:25.075 --> 05:31.540
A psychic and a wishbone?
Guys, give someone else a chance.

05:32.041 --> 05:34.084
- All right, who wants to do it?
- Ooh, can I?

05:34.293 --> 05:37.254
Vegetarians never get
to do the wishbone.

05:37.421 --> 05:40.257
It's really not fair.
Just because we don't eat the meat...

05:40.424 --> 05:43.510
...doesn't mean we don't like
to play with the carcasses.

05:44.136 --> 05:45.846
All right. Rash'?

05:46.055 --> 05:48.432
I don't want that turkey smell
all over my hands.

05:48.640 --> 05:52.186
I'll do it! It'll get the casserole
stink off of mine.

05:54.646 --> 05:57.274
- I hope I win.
- Well, it doesn't really matter.

05:57.441 --> 05:59.401
You're both wishing
for the same thing.

05:59.610 --> 06:04.365
I can't tell you what I'm wishing for, or else,
you know, it won't come true. Ha, ha.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.618
Right. But we know
what you're wishing for.

06:07.826 --> 06:10.788
- I can't really say.
- I understand.

06:10.954 --> 06:13.499
But you're wishing
for what we think, aren't you?

06:13.707 --> 06:16.460
I'm not really comfortable
with these questions!

06:16.627 --> 06:18.712
- Please!
- Just do it!

06:18.921 --> 06:20.881
Okay. One, two, three.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.966
I won! Hey!

06:23.133 --> 06:26.261
You know what? I'm sure your
wish is gonna come true.

06:26.428 --> 06:29.973
But, you guys, just in case, maybe a
genie will come out if we rub this lamp.

06:30.140 --> 06:31.683
Qw!

06:32.601 --> 06:34.645
That thing gets hot!

06:34.812 --> 06:36.480
Ross, just keep making yourjokes.

06:36.647 --> 06:38.857
How are you gonna feel
if we actually do win?

06:39.066 --> 06:42.236
- Uh, you're not gonna win.
- I know the odds are against us...

06:42.403 --> 06:46.573
...but somebody has to win, and it could
be us. And then how you gonna feel?

06:46.740 --> 06:50.494
We're gonna be like, "Everybody, let's
take our helicopters up to the Cape."

06:50.661 --> 06:53.038
And you're gonna be all,
like, "Oh, I can't, guys.

06:53.205 --> 06:56.417
I'll have to meet you up there.
I gotta gas up the Hyundai."

07:00.546 --> 07:04.591
Okay, I've heard myself on tape,
and I sound nothing like that.

07:05.384 --> 07:07.970
I can see the headline now:
"Lottery Winners' Friend...

07:08.137 --> 07:10.556
...Filled With Regret,
Eats Own Arm."

07:11.265 --> 07:12.724
Why would I eat my own arm?

07:12.933 --> 07:16.520
Well, you wouldn't, but we own the
paper. We can print whatever we want.

07:16.687 --> 07:19.314
You know what? I'm gonna
throw in 50 bucks for you.

07:19.982 --> 07:21.900
- Why?
- Because I know that you think...

07:22.067 --> 07:25.154
...that the lottery is boo-hockey...

07:25.529 --> 07:29.074
...but we're all here, and we're gonna
watch the numbers and have fun.

07:29.241 --> 07:33.245
And you're my brother,
and I want you to be a part of this.

07:33.954 --> 07:37.666
You don't have to do that.
I mean, I'll pay for myself.

07:37.833 --> 07:41.712
But just the fact that you want me to
have fun with you guys, that's so sweet.

07:41.879 --> 07:43.505
Come here.

07:44.548 --> 07:47.009
Get a room.

07:50.345 --> 07:53.015
So now that you're in,
what are you gonna do if we win?

07:53.223 --> 07:57.853
- I don't know. I'll probably just invest it.
- Ooh. Calm down.

07:58.020 --> 08:00.814
Seriously, that's your fantasy?
To invest it?

08:01.023 --> 08:05.736
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I say, "invest it"?
I meant, "Be cool and piss it all away."

08:06.862 --> 08:11.658
Oh! Oh! I know! We should pool all
our money and buy the Knicks!

08:11.992 --> 08:13.869
I don't really care about the Knicks.

08:14.077 --> 08:16.997
You will when I pick you
as starting forward.

08:17.414 --> 08:21.418
You would do that?
I never get picked!

08:21.793 --> 08:23.795
I'm not sure a sports team
is the way to go.

08:23.962 --> 08:27.466
You won't let me buy the Knicks?
I can't believe you're taking this away.

08:27.633 --> 08:30.802
You're right, it has been your dream
for over 15 seconds.

08:32.513 --> 08:35.974
Uh, how long until they announce
the numbers, Mommy?

08:36.475 --> 08:40.729
I'll take this one too. Uh, "Mommy"?

08:41.188 --> 08:43.941
Oh, I've gotten into the habit
of calling Rachel "Mommy"...

08:44.107 --> 08:45.984
...when we're around Emma.

08:46.151 --> 08:50.030
Which I now realize we are not.

08:51.156 --> 08:53.075
I'm hoping that if she hears it enough...

08:53.242 --> 08:54.576
- ...it'll be her first word.
- Oh.

08:54.785 --> 08:57.829
Although if we're gonna do that,
we should probably call me "Daddy" too.

08:57.996 --> 09:01.959
Mm. I like that, Daddy.

09:05.671 --> 09:08.549
I, uh... I was just talking about Rachel.

09:08.757 --> 09:10.842
Ooh, is Daddy getting angry?

09:13.512 --> 09:16.181
Is Daddy gonna spank me?

09:18.100 --> 09:20.352
Well, that depends.

09:20.519 --> 09:23.272
Have you been a bad...? No, I can't.

09:26.733 --> 09:30.946
Hello? Hello? Hey, Charlie.
Did anybody else hear?

09:31.947 --> 09:34.491
What? Susan got it? How?

09:34.658 --> 09:37.786
Oh, man, I would've slept with him!

09:38.537 --> 09:40.581
All right, bye.

09:41.164 --> 09:43.792
Dude, I'm sorry.
But hey, there's one spot left, right?

09:43.959 --> 09:46.670
- Well, Charlie's gonna get that.
- Hey, don't say that.

09:46.837 --> 09:49.506
You've got just as good a chance
of getting that job.

09:49.715 --> 09:51.383
He is the boss' son.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.469
- Come on, lottery!
- Yeah!

09:54.636 --> 09:57.347
- It starts in, like, 20 minutes.
- Okay, here we go.

09:57.514 --> 10:00.892
We need to sort through the tickets
quickly to see if we've won.

10:01.059 --> 10:03.770
So does anybody have any ideas
how to organize this?

10:03.937 --> 10:06.106
Okay, how about this:

10:06.898 --> 10:08.942
We divide them
into six groups of 40.

10:09.109 --> 10:12.154
The remaining 10 can be read
by whoever finishes first.

10:12.362 --> 10:15.115
- I have another idea.
- I'm sorry, idea time is over.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.661
- Well, are all the tickets in the bowl?
- Yeah.

10:19.870 --> 10:23.332
- What about the ones on the nightstand?
- There are no tickets there.

10:23.540 --> 10:25.834
Yes, there are.
I just saw them a few minutes ago.

10:26.001 --> 10:30.380
Heh. Uh, no, you didn't.
You must be mistaken.

10:30.547 --> 10:33.842
- There are 20 tickets on the nightstand.
- Chandler, sense the tone.

10:35.510 --> 10:39.723
Well, well, well.
Look what Mommy found.

10:40.682 --> 10:44.102
Okay, fine. I bought 20 extra
tickets for me and Chandler.

10:45.479 --> 10:47.981
The psychic also said
that I would be betrayed.

10:49.691 --> 10:52.569
I can't believe this.
I thought we were all in this together.

10:52.778 --> 10:56.114
- Hey, you just got in five minutes ago!
- Three minutes ago!

10:56.281 --> 10:58.825
I don't know why that's important.

10:59.034 --> 11:03.163
I was with you the whole time.
When did you even get those?

11:03.372 --> 11:07.876
When you were reading the dirty
magazines without taking off the plastic.

11:08.210 --> 11:09.961
I'll show you how.

11:10.921 --> 11:14.216
Okay. Well, Monica, suppose one
of your special tickets wins?

11:14.383 --> 11:17.219
How are you gonna feel when you win
and lose your friends?

11:17.427 --> 11:21.223
Please. If I win the lottery,
you guys are not gonna leave me.

11:21.390 --> 11:25.560
Someone gave me muffins last week.
I couldn't get rid of you for three days!

11:26.645 --> 11:29.856
Chandler, would you just tell her
what she did was wrong?

11:30.065 --> 11:32.943
She's right. You shouldn't have
bought tickets just for us.

11:33.151 --> 11:34.778
Let me finish.

11:34.945 --> 11:37.572
However, it doesn't look like
I'm gonna get this job...

11:37.739 --> 11:42.077
...so I can't afford to have principles.
So screw you! The tickets are ours!

11:43.036 --> 11:45.622
There's the man I married.

11:45.872 --> 11:48.166
All right. Believe me,
if you win the lottery...

11:48.333 --> 11:50.335
...it's the last you're gonna hear from us.

11:50.544 --> 11:55.257
Fine. Don't be my friends.
I'll buy new friends.

11:55.507 --> 12:00.429
Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic
surgery so they look just like you!

12:00.595 --> 12:03.223
You know what?
I want my share of the tickets.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.892
I want my tickets too!
And I'm buying the Knicks!

12:06.059 --> 12:08.520
And Steffi Graf! Ha, ha.

12:08.687 --> 12:11.064
Cool. Then I want mine too!
And if I win...

12:11.231 --> 12:14.401
...I'm gonna put it all
into a very low-yield bond!

12:14.609 --> 12:18.947
No. You guys, we gotta keep
all the tickets together.

12:19.114 --> 12:21.158
No. No, we should divide them up...

12:21.324 --> 12:23.744
...and I should get extra because
we used my car!

12:23.952 --> 12:26.663
Hey! Hey! If anybody gets extra tickets,
it should be me!

12:26.830 --> 12:31.460
- This whole thing was my idea!
- Yeah. Thanks for inventing the lottery!

12:32.544 --> 12:35.046
Just give them to me,
and I'll split them up!

12:35.213 --> 12:37.215
Aw!
- Ah!

12:37.382 --> 12:39.426
ROSSI Hey, hey!
- Aah!

12:40.093 --> 12:43.138
God, I can't take it anymore!
I'm putting an end to this!

12:43.346 --> 12:46.683
- Okay, if she jumps, I get her tickets!
- Wait, no, no! Hey!

12:48.477 --> 12:51.480
If we're not doing this together,
we're not doing it at all.

12:51.646 --> 12:53.982
- Say goodbye to your tickets.
- No! No! No!

12:54.191 --> 12:56.777
Do not come any closer!

12:56.943 --> 13:00.655
Can I come a little bit closer?
Valuable things are getting squished.

13:00.864 --> 13:03.533
Now, what's more important,
your friends or money?

13:03.742 --> 13:06.119
- Fflends!
- Money!

13:09.456 --> 13:10.999
Fflends.

13:11.875 --> 13:14.294
Hey, Monica,
what about your extra tickets?

13:14.503 --> 13:16.505
They're all in there.

13:17.255 --> 13:20.592
- Even these five that I hid in my bra.
- Monica!

13:20.759 --> 13:23.595
Okay. Good. You guys were so scared.

13:23.762 --> 13:26.598
There is no way I was
gonna dump this...

13:26.765 --> 13:29.392
- Aah!

13:32.062 --> 13:34.731
I think I broke your bowl.

13:35.023 --> 13:37.692
Go! Go! Go!

13:52.040 --> 13:56.378
What a beautiful night to be running
around the street, looking for tickets.

13:57.128 --> 13:59.339
And the wind sure made it fun.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.634
- Phoebe, we lost half of them.
- So what?

14:02.801 --> 14:04.928
Monica, we have the winning ticket.

14:05.095 --> 14:08.557
My psychic said I was
gonna win, remember?

14:08.723 --> 14:12.477
Weird your psychic didn't mention
anything about the scary pigeon.

14:13.979 --> 14:17.607
As a matter of fact, she said
that's how I'm going to die.

14:17.774 --> 14:22.070
So excuse me
for being a little skittish.

14:22.237 --> 14:24.406
There's two messages.
This could be from work.

14:24.573 --> 14:27.951
- Oh, play them.
- Okay. Here we go.

14:29.327 --> 14:35.166
Hello. This is the pigeon
from the balcony calling to apologize.

14:35.625 --> 14:41.089
I shouldn't have knocked the tickets
out of the pretty lady's hand.

14:41.756 --> 14:46.303
It was all my fault.
Not hers. Bye. Coo.

14:52.100 --> 14:55.353
Well, I bet that was very hard
for him to do.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.065
Hey, Chandler, it's Charlie.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.109
This is it. Shh, Shh!

15:01.276 --> 15:05.447
Listen, um, it turns out I got the last spot.

15:05.614 --> 15:08.450
I'm really sorry, man.
It was a lot of fun working with you

15:08.617 --> 15:11.077
Give me a call if you want.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.997
Gosh, I'm so sorry, honey.

15:14.164 --> 15:15.707
Sorry, Chandler.

15:15.874 --> 15:20.795
It is so unfair. It's like that time they
promoted Saundra over me at work.

15:21.004 --> 15:22.714
Was she related to Ralph Lauren?

15:22.923 --> 15:26.593
No, she was just much better
at her job than me.

15:26.801 --> 15:28.637
You guys, the drawing's about to start.

15:28.803 --> 15:31.806
We should call my mom's
and say good night to Emma...

15:31.973 --> 15:34.017
- ...before she goes down.
- Good idea.

15:34.517 --> 15:37.312
Honey, you're being really strong
about this.

15:37.479 --> 15:40.023
I know how badly you wanted that job.

15:40.231 --> 15:43.026
Yeah, you know,
I really thought I deserved it.

15:43.318 --> 15:48.615
But let's go win the lottery. I mean,
we still have a 130 chances to win, right?

15:50.241 --> 15:52.661
Hundred and thirty-one.

15:53.578 --> 15:56.289
Yeah, good night, sweetheart.
I love you.

15:56.456 --> 16:00.293
And remember,
you're Daddy's little girl. Heh.

16:00.460 --> 16:03.129
Phoebe's totally ruined that for me.

16:06.758 --> 16:08.259
Hi, Mom. Put her back on.

16:08.426 --> 16:10.428
Rach, they're announcing the numbers!

16:11.179 --> 16:14.641
My God, I can already feel
myself changing.

16:15.058 --> 16:18.937
Here are your official Powerball
numbers. We have 53.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.648
- I've got that.
- We have one too!

16:21.815 --> 16:24.609
We are on the road, people!

16:25.944 --> 16:26.987
Come on!

16:27.195 --> 16:32.659
Mom, please, I know you love your new
lips, but I can barely understand you.

16:32.826 --> 16:35.954
Would you please just let me
say good night to my daughter?

16:36.162 --> 16:38.540
And here we go.
The Powerball is seven.

16:38.748 --> 16:42.460
All right, check your numbers!
Make me rich.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.922
You guys,
you're not gonna believe this.

16:46.089 --> 16:49.467
I was just saying good night
to Emma, and she said her first words.

16:49.884 --> 16:51.761
- What?
- Well, what did she say?

16:51.970 --> 16:54.806
She said, "Gleba"!

16:58.643 --> 17:00.895
Make me rich!

17:01.521 --> 17:04.898
- Isn't that amazing?
- Oh, yeah. No, no, no, that's great.

17:05.066 --> 17:06.776
Why aren't you more excited?

17:07.527 --> 17:11.239
Rach, heh, "gleba" is not a word.

17:11.656 --> 17:15.660
- Well, of course it is.
- Okay. What does it mean?

17:15.868 --> 17:18.913
Well, I don't know all the words.

17:19.289 --> 17:22.791
You know, I'm just glad I didn't
miss my daughter's first word.

17:22.959 --> 17:27.297
- Yes you did! Gleba is a word!
- Okay. Use it in a sentence.

17:27.505 --> 17:31.301
Okay. Uh, Emma just said, "Gleba

17:34.345 --> 17:38.349
- It's not a word.
- Ugh. Okay, fine. I'm gonna look it up.

17:38.516 --> 17:40.060
Oh, okay, great.

17:40.268 --> 17:43.980
While you're at it, she said another word
the other day. Why don't you look up:

17:49.861 --> 17:54.240
All right. Okay. Okay. Gleba
Gleba. Gleba. Gleba!

17:54.449 --> 17:59.829
Here it is! "The fleshy, spore-bearing
inner mass of a certain fungi."

18:03.500 --> 18:04.584
Heh.

18:04.751 --> 18:08.171
She's gonna be a scientist.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.972
- Damn it. Anybody got anything?
- No.

18:18.640 --> 18:20.308
I'm still looking through mine.

18:20.517 --> 18:23.686
Just double-checking. No.

18:23.853 --> 18:26.773
No. No.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.655
No!

18:36.866 --> 18:39.661
Hello? Hold on.

18:39.828 --> 18:40.870
It's your boss.

18:41.037 --> 18:43.832
Ah, the "I'm sorry I rejected you"
phone call.

18:43.998 --> 18:46.626
I'm not used to getting these
from guys.

18:47.669 --> 18:50.171
- Hey, Steve.
- Chandler, hi.

18:50.338 --> 18:53.258
I'm sure you've heard
we filled the three positions.

18:53.424 --> 18:55.760
We felt that with your
maturity and experience...

18:55.927 --> 18:58.388
...you wouldn't be happy
being someone's assistant.

18:58.596 --> 19:01.182
I'd love to be somebody's
assistant. Answering phones...

19:01.349 --> 19:03.184
...getting coffee,
I live for that stuff.

19:03.351 --> 19:08.273
And I'm not too mature.
Farts, boobies, butt cracks!

19:10.316 --> 19:13.611
Chandler, you were the strongest
person in the program.

19:13.778 --> 19:17.240
We're offering you the position
of junior copywriter.

19:18.950 --> 19:21.703
Me? That guy
who just said, "butt cracks"?

19:21.870 --> 19:23.079
Yes, that's right.

19:23.288 --> 19:25.623
We're excited about the level
of sophistication...

19:25.790 --> 19:28.126
...you'll be bringing to the job.

19:29.544 --> 19:33.214
Okay. Well, thanks, you won't regret it.
I'll see you tomorrow.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.353
What?

19:47.520 --> 19:49.480
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna
be a junior copywriter!

19:51.566 --> 19:54.527
Congratulations!
Oh, sweetie, I'm so proud of you.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.322
Thanks. Does that mean
I get the good loving tonight?

19:57.488 --> 20:01.326
You bet. No TV or anything.

20:01.993 --> 20:05.330
- Hey, that is so great about the job.
- Thanks, man.

20:05.496 --> 20:07.665
I'd like to think I had
something to do with it.

20:07.874 --> 20:11.085
- Really? Why?
- Well, before with the wishbone.

20:11.252 --> 20:17.008
I, uh, didn't wish we would win the lottery.
I wished you'd get the job.

20:17.467 --> 20:19.510
Oh, yeah?

20:19.844 --> 20:21.888
Don't tell Monica.
She'll rip your heart out.

20:22.096 --> 20:23.264
Oh, yeah.

20:26.017 --> 20:28.519
Well, you know what?
There was a little part of me...

20:28.686 --> 20:30.772
...that really thought we were gonna win.

20:30.980 --> 20:37.445
Me too. So much for my
dinosaur/Amelia Earhart theme park.

20:38.571 --> 20:42.033
You guys? What was the Powerball
number again?

20:42.200 --> 20:44.786
- Seven.
- We won.

20:45.078 --> 20:46.871
- What?
- We won!

20:47.038 --> 20:49.749
- Let me see! Let me see!
- Don't tear it!

20:50.124 --> 20:53.920
Phoebe, you don't have any
of the first five numbers!

20:55.004 --> 21:01.261
I know that, but look, we got
the Powerball number. We won $3!

21:02.136 --> 21:06.224
Wow, you think we should get that over
20 years or go for the big payout?

21:06.391 --> 21:11.020
I don't care. I've never won
anything before. I can't believe this!

21:11.229 --> 21:13.481
So, Pheebs, what are you gonna do
with your $3?

21:13.690 --> 21:16.818
Well, it's not all mine.
We all get 50 cents.

21:17.527 --> 21:20.488
Aw. You know what?
You can have mine.

21:20.655 --> 21:21.906
- Me too.
- Me too.

21:22.073 --> 21:24.409
Me too. Ha, ha.

21:29.122 --> 21:32.000
Well, I guess if everybody else is.

21:41.467 --> 21:44.429
Hey, guys. So I just called
the Powerball hot line.

21:44.762 --> 21:49.892
- Can you believe it? Nobody won.
- Um, I beg to differ.

21:51.394 --> 21:55.023
Maybe nobody won the jackpot,
but there was this guy in here earlier...

21:55.189 --> 22:00.111
...and he found a ticket on the street
right outside and won $10,000.

22:09.620 --> 22:14.751
Coo. Again, don't blame the pretty lady.

22:15.126 --> 22:20.089
It was not her fault.
It was me, the pigeon. Coo.

22:23.634 --> 22:26.929
Seriously, stop staring at her.
