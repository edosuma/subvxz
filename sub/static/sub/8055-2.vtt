WEBVTT

00:02.917 --> 00:05.445
Lots of miserable
dehydrated people

00:05.491 --> 00:07.087
with high fevers and diarrhea.

00:07.453 --> 00:08.633
And one of those

00:08.753 --> 00:11.718
dehydrated, high-fevered
miserable people

00:11.755 --> 00:12.726
is April...

00:13.274 --> 00:14.157
Who hates me.

00:17.891 --> 00:20.361
- I want another nurse.
- Well, there are none.

00:20.481 --> 00:21.732
We're stretched pretty thin
right now.

00:21.852 --> 00:24.023
Then I want a janitor.
They can do what you do, right?

00:24.474 --> 00:27.279
Yep, nurses and janitors
are totally interchangeable.

00:27.527 --> 00:29.180
Except no one dresses up
like a janitor

00:29.210 --> 00:30.110
when they want to be slutty.

00:30.449 --> 00:32.943
I get the sense that maybe
you're angry at me

00:33.063 --> 00:33.882
for kissing Andy...

00:34.002 --> 00:35.558
No, I'm not. What are you talking about?
That's crazy.

00:35.678 --> 00:38.911
And that you think it might be
fun to take it out on me.

00:39.372 --> 00:40.435
Please don't do that.

00:40.641 --> 00:42.572
"Do"?
I can't do anything.

00:43.080 --> 00:44.103
I'm sick.

00:49.089 --> 00:50.881
My blankets are on the floor.

00:55.620 --> 01:05.560
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:12.670 --> 01:13.970
So, JJ, we wanted

01:14.021 --> 01:16.006
to talk to you
about the harvest festival.

01:16.073 --> 01:18.275
Yeah, I heard you were
bringing that back.

01:19.543 --> 01:21.328
Sorry, I haven't been
feeling myself.

01:22.747 --> 01:25.448
Well, I'm organizing
this huge harvest festival,

01:25.516 --> 01:28.518
and I need
at least 80 local businesses

01:28.586 --> 01:29.853
to participate.

01:29.921 --> 01:31.488
And normally, this is
the kind of thing

01:31.555 --> 01:32.756
I would love to do,

01:32.823 --> 01:35.692
but I'm just feeling
really tired.

01:35.760 --> 01:39.029
I think maybe my allergies
are acting up.

01:39.096 --> 01:43.900
I've already vomited,
like, five times today.

01:43.968 --> 01:45.969
We're having a meeting tonight
at the Chamber of Commerce,

01:46.020 --> 01:47.604
and we're gonna go over
all the details,

01:47.672 --> 01:49.673
and we'd just love if you
could come and join us.

01:49.740 --> 01:52.876
Sure, anything
for my favorite customer.

01:52.944 --> 01:54.861
I bet you say that
to all the girls.

01:54.946 --> 01:57.180
Oh, no, no.
Actually, you're my favorite.

01:57.248 --> 02:02.869
You spent over $1,000 last year
on waffles alone.

02:04.722 --> 02:05.755
Here.

02:05.823 --> 02:07.557
I didn't know what
to bring you,

02:07.625 --> 02:10.627
so I just got
some magazines and lipstick...

02:10.695 --> 02:11.745
woman stuff.

02:11.829 --> 02:13.163
Thanks.

02:13.214 --> 02:16.366
All my parents got me was that.

02:16.434 --> 02:17.884
Okay, well, I'm not very good

02:17.969 --> 02:19.869
at visiting people
in hospitals,

02:19.920 --> 02:22.005
so I'm going to go.

02:22.073 --> 02:25.708
Hey, if you see Andy,
will you not tell him I'm here?

02:25.760 --> 02:27.344
- Okay.
- Because of what happened,

02:27.411 --> 02:28.912
- I don't want him to think...
- Stop.

02:28.980 --> 02:31.081
Don't want to know.

02:31.148 --> 02:33.483
The less I know
about other people's affairs,

02:33.551 --> 02:34.651
the happier I am.

02:34.719 --> 02:37.721
I'm not interested
in caring about people.

02:37.788 --> 02:39.990
I once worked
with a guy for three years

02:40.057 --> 02:41.992
and never learned his name...

02:42.059 --> 02:44.694
Best friend I ever had.

02:44.762 --> 02:47.897
We still never talk sometimes.

02:50.401 --> 02:51.951
Mmm.

02:52.036 --> 02:54.921
So we've developed
a revenue-sharing formula

02:55.006 --> 02:57.374
that will hopefully appeal
to most business owners.

02:57.425 --> 02:58.608
Leslie!

02:58.676 --> 03:00.543
Go home.
You're sick.

03:00.611 --> 03:02.462
I'm not sick.
It's just allergies.

03:02.546 --> 03:04.747
Come on, guys.
Just let me in there.

03:04.799 --> 03:06.082
- No.
- You can't come in here.

03:06.133 --> 03:07.417
You're not coming in.

03:07.485 --> 03:09.386
Leslie, you look tired,
and you're all sweaty.

03:09.437 --> 03:11.137
You look tired, and you're
all sweaty all the time.

03:11.222 --> 03:12.889
What's your excuse?
You want to go there, Jerry?

03:12.940 --> 03:14.724
- No.
- Fine, I'm coming in.

03:14.775 --> 03:16.893
Donna, barricade the door, now!

03:16.944 --> 03:19.779
Donna, come on, just let me in.

03:19.864 --> 03:21.097
Un-uh.

03:21.165 --> 03:23.233
Either go home,
or go back into quarantine.

03:23.300 --> 03:24.934
I'm not going home.

03:25.002 --> 03:26.769
Get out of here, Leslie.
Go home.

03:26.821 --> 03:28.438
Hit the bricks.

03:32.309 --> 03:33.643
Oh, come on.
No, no, no, no, no.

03:33.711 --> 03:35.078
She's germing up all my stuff.

03:35.129 --> 03:37.647
Aw, yuck.
Leslie!

03:39.917 --> 03:41.968
- Ann Perkins.
- Hey.

03:42.053 --> 03:43.169
How was your run?

03:43.254 --> 03:44.921
Ended
with a 5 1/2-minute mile,

03:44.972 --> 03:46.139
my personal low.

03:46.223 --> 03:48.508
I think the pavement
in this town is soft.

03:48.592 --> 03:51.010
- What's with the mask?
- Flu prevention.

03:51.095 --> 03:53.329
My body is finely tuned,
like a microchip.

03:53.397 --> 03:55.065
And the flu is like
a grain of sand.

03:55.132 --> 03:57.517
It could literally shut down
the entire system.

03:57.601 --> 03:59.636
My body's like a chip too.

03:59.703 --> 04:01.871
Potato chip.

04:01.939 --> 04:02.989
No.

04:03.074 --> 04:04.157
Speaking of potato chips,

04:04.241 --> 04:06.142
you and I are on
for dinner tomorrow, yes?

04:06.210 --> 04:07.310
Yes, definitely.

04:07.361 --> 04:10.313
I'm super, super excited.

04:10.381 --> 04:11.498
Looking forward to it.

04:11.582 --> 04:13.316
Excellent.

04:15.836 --> 04:17.454
Way to go, buddy.
Way to go.

04:17.505 --> 04:19.089
We've been on a couple
of dates.

04:19.156 --> 04:20.339
I really like him.

04:20.423 --> 04:24.660
The problem is,
he's like a perfect human man.

04:24.712 --> 04:27.497
I can't find one flaw.

04:27.565 --> 04:30.666
There was one time
I thought he farted.

04:30.718 --> 04:32.852
But it was me.

04:34.538 --> 04:38.224
I need to find someone
to fill in for April.

04:38.309 --> 04:40.743
Now, I know I'm not
gonna find someone

04:40.811 --> 04:44.314
who's both aggressively mean
and apathetic.

04:44.381 --> 04:47.750
April really is
the whole package.

04:47.818 --> 04:49.719
But I think
I might know someone

04:49.787 --> 04:52.455
who will be
just as ineffective.

04:55.910 --> 04:58.545
Hello, Andrew.
What's new?

04:58.629 --> 05:00.630
Um, a whole lot.

05:00.697 --> 05:02.599
Check this out.
I just invented it...

05:02.666 --> 05:03.833
super straw.

05:03.884 --> 05:07.537
♪ ♪

05:07.588 --> 05:09.105
Ahh.

05:09.173 --> 05:12.342
So just sit here
and do your thing.

05:12.409 --> 05:14.010
Do I have to tuck my shirt in?

05:14.061 --> 05:15.912
Because, honestly,
that's kind of a deal breaker.

05:15.980 --> 05:17.096
Let 'er fly.

05:17.181 --> 05:18.481
Hey, wait.

05:18.549 --> 05:19.882
Where's April?

05:19.934 --> 05:21.451
Is she all right?

05:21.519 --> 05:24.887
Yeah. I just gave her
the day off.

05:24.939 --> 05:27.790
Would it be weird
if I asked for the day off?

05:27.858 --> 05:30.243
Yeah, no. It's okay.
I didn't think so.

05:30.327 --> 05:32.061
I'm sorry.
Are you leaving?

05:32.129 --> 05:33.730
- I thought we had a meeting.
- No, we do.

05:33.797 --> 05:35.765
It's just I think
it's a little chilly in here.

05:35.833 --> 05:37.200
Are you okay?
Your eyes are glassy.

05:37.251 --> 05:38.418
Oh, my God.
Oh, my...

05:38.502 --> 05:40.069
Is she... is she sick?
Are you sick?

05:40.120 --> 05:43.173
- No.
- Yeah, she's sick.

05:43.240 --> 05:44.807
That's why I'm wearing this

05:44.875 --> 05:47.076
and misting myself
with hand sanitizer.

05:47.127 --> 05:48.795
I am not sick.

05:48.879 --> 05:50.580
I just have allergies, okay?

05:50.631 --> 05:51.914
I took a Claritin,
and I threw that up.

05:51.966 --> 05:53.616
So I took another one.
I threw that up.

05:53.684 --> 05:55.602
And then I took a third,
and it stayed down.

05:55.686 --> 05:56.719
I'm getting better.

05:56.770 --> 05:58.154
All right, you're burning up.

05:58.222 --> 05:59.856
You're burning up.
What?

05:59.923 --> 06:01.057
I have to get out of here.

06:01.108 --> 06:02.942
I have 2.8% body fat.

06:03.027 --> 06:04.310
My body's like a microchip.

06:04.395 --> 06:06.946
A grain of sand
could destroy it.

06:07.031 --> 06:10.066
My body's a microchip.

06:10.117 --> 06:11.100
Leslie, go home.

06:11.151 --> 06:12.535
No, I can't.
I can't go home.

06:12.603 --> 06:14.120
I have to get ready
for the Chamber of Secrets.

06:14.205 --> 06:15.605
Commerce.

06:15.673 --> 06:17.106
If this meeting
does not go perfectly,

06:17.174 --> 06:19.108
then the harvest festival's
gonna be over before it began.

06:19.176 --> 06:20.443
I cannot go home.

06:20.494 --> 06:23.796
- Okay, then who is your doctor?
- Ann's my doctor.

06:23.881 --> 06:26.082
And she's the most beautiful
nurse in the world.

06:26.133 --> 06:27.917
- Come on.
- Oh, God.

06:27.968 --> 06:29.252
Now I'm hot.
Now it's really hot in here.

06:29.303 --> 06:31.087
Okay, well, that's your fever.

06:31.138 --> 06:33.756
Leslie, I typed your symptoms
into the thing up here,

06:33.807 --> 06:37.510
and it says you could have
network connectivity problems.

06:37.595 --> 06:39.979
104.1.

06:40.064 --> 06:42.265
Leslie, you're dehydrated.
I'm admitting you.

06:42.316 --> 06:44.267
If I was sick, could I do this?

06:47.438 --> 06:50.373
- What are you doing?
- Cartwheels.

06:50.441 --> 06:51.708
Am I not doing them?

06:51.775 --> 06:53.676
- No.
- Look, don't worry.

06:53.744 --> 06:55.678
I've done presentations
like this before,

06:55.746 --> 06:56.946
and Tom will be with me.

06:56.997 --> 06:58.481
So you're in good hands.

06:58.532 --> 07:01.451
It's not
that I don't trust Ben.

07:01.502 --> 07:04.787
It's that I don't have
faith in Ben.

07:04.855 --> 07:08.291
And also, I'm starting
to forget who Ben is.

07:11.263 --> 07:13.405
I'll handle the general outline
if you want to uh...

07:13.525 --> 07:14.842
- Look.
- Just jump right in.

07:14.910 --> 07:16.310
The worst thing you can do

07:16.378 --> 07:18.346
with an important presentation
like this is over-prepare.

07:18.413 --> 07:19.947
- Well...
- So...

07:19.998 --> 07:21.716
I think it's best
if I go to the spa.

07:21.783 --> 07:25.386
No, we promised Leslie
we'd prep for the meeting.

07:25.454 --> 07:26.721
No, Ben, you promised Leslie.

07:26.788 --> 07:29.006
See, I never promise
Leslie anything.

07:29.091 --> 07:30.791
That way,
I never disappoint her.

07:30.859 --> 07:31.943
I try to be considerate.

07:32.010 --> 07:33.361
Well...

07:33.428 --> 07:36.830
I am off for a soak
and a schvitz.

07:36.882 --> 07:39.817
"Arrivederch."

07:44.973 --> 07:48.175
Ron Swanson's office.

07:48.243 --> 07:49.277
Yes.

07:49.344 --> 07:51.279
I will transfer you.

07:55.751 --> 07:59.353
I just dropped another call.

08:03.742 --> 08:06.661
I thought you might like
a fresh set of pillows.

08:06.712 --> 08:08.095
Are you trying to smother me?

08:08.163 --> 08:10.364
Help!
The slutty nurse is trying

08:10.415 --> 08:12.333
to smother me to death
with a pillow!

08:12.384 --> 08:13.534
Okay, never mind.

08:13.585 --> 08:15.419
Stay back, slut.

08:15.504 --> 08:17.438
I know what she's trying to do.

08:17.506 --> 08:18.839
She's trying to get me
to break.

08:18.890 --> 08:20.841
And you know what?
I'm not gonna do it.

08:20.909 --> 08:22.093
I'm gonna be professional,

08:22.177 --> 08:23.945
and I'm gonna put on
a happy face,

08:24.012 --> 08:25.513
and then I'm gonna
go into a supply closet

08:25.580 --> 08:27.915
and snap a bunch
of tongue depressors.

08:27.983 --> 08:30.718
Okay, so let's, um,
talk about your opening remarks.

08:30.786 --> 08:32.453
Do you want me
to write you a rap?

08:32.520 --> 08:33.754
I'll write you a rap.
No, you know what?

08:33.822 --> 08:35.323
You're never gonna be able
to pull it off.

08:35.390 --> 08:36.440
You're too white.

08:36.525 --> 08:37.792
How about a show tune
or something?

08:37.859 --> 08:40.861
I was just, uh, planning
to introduce myself...

08:40.912 --> 08:42.196
Non-musically,

08:42.264 --> 08:44.432
and then get everyone
to refer to their packets,

08:44.499 --> 08:46.400
and, uh, blah, blah, blah.

08:46.468 --> 08:48.469
No.
No "blah, blah, blah," okay?

08:48.537 --> 08:50.571
You need to go over
every single detail with me.

08:50.639 --> 08:53.240
Leslie, I promise you,
I won't half-ass this, okay?

08:53.292 --> 08:54.675
Now get some rest.

08:54.743 --> 08:56.911
I have some great news.
I think my fever just broke.

08:56.979 --> 08:58.596
Good-bye.

09:05.053 --> 09:06.087
This came out.

09:06.154 --> 09:07.288
Eh.

09:07.356 --> 09:08.589
I am starving.

09:08.640 --> 09:10.191
I haven't had lunch
since yesterday.

09:10.258 --> 09:11.759
So I'm gonna head over
to Callahan's.

09:11.810 --> 09:13.060
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't go there.

09:13.128 --> 09:14.595
They totally skimp on pickles.

09:14.646 --> 09:16.430
Let me go
to Bighead Joe's for you.

09:16.481 --> 09:18.899
They have
the most insane burritos.

09:18.950 --> 09:20.835
I don't much go
for ethnic food.

09:20.902 --> 09:22.169
No, no, no.
Trust me.

09:22.237 --> 09:24.071
They have one that's called
the meat tornado.

09:24.139 --> 09:26.324
Literally killed a guy
last year.

09:26.408 --> 09:28.776
You had me
at "meat tornado."

09:32.497 --> 09:33.914
What are you doing?

09:33.982 --> 09:35.416
Hey, that flu medicine
really helped.

09:35.467 --> 09:37.118
I feel
a thousand percent better.

09:37.185 --> 09:38.552
Good as new.

09:38.620 --> 09:40.554
Does this scarf look okay?
I don't want to look stuffy.

09:40.622 --> 09:42.423
But I also don't want
to look too schlubby.

09:42.474 --> 09:44.342
- Get back in that bed.
- So no to the scarf?

09:44.426 --> 09:47.128
- Get back in the bed.
- No, I'm going to that meeting.

09:47.195 --> 09:48.696
Either you get back in the bed,

09:48.764 --> 09:50.164
or I will strap you down.

09:50.232 --> 09:52.933
I've done it before.
Don't test me.

09:57.856 --> 09:59.907
- Okay, okay, okay.
- All right.

09:59.975 --> 10:02.143
Now, what superpower
would you rather have?

10:02.210 --> 10:04.995
Would you rather be able to fly
or be invisible?

10:05.080 --> 10:06.313
Ed, go first.

10:06.365 --> 10:09.149
- Uh, fly, I guess.
- I forgot to tell you.

10:09.201 --> 10:10.951
You can only fly five feet
above the ground.

10:12.987 --> 10:15.489
I bring a certain panache
and spice

10:15.557 --> 10:17.358
to the spa experience
for these guys.

10:17.426 --> 10:19.794
Before I joined, they were just
three old white dudes

10:19.845 --> 10:22.012
quietly boiling in hot water.

10:22.097 --> 10:25.199
Would you rather live
in the pocket

10:25.267 --> 10:27.835
of a giant kangaroo

10:27.903 --> 10:31.439
or have a pocket
on your own stomach

10:31.506 --> 10:34.341
that has a tiny kangaroo
in it all the time?

10:34.393 --> 10:35.726
Preston.

10:35.811 --> 10:38.145
Tiny kangaroo
in my stomach pocket.

10:38.196 --> 10:41.182
Forgot to mention,
the tiny kangaroo is a racist.

10:43.118 --> 10:45.519
Hey, Ann.

10:45.570 --> 10:46.821
What happened?

10:46.872 --> 10:49.523
I just saw you a few hours ago,
and you were fine.

10:49.574 --> 10:51.492
Not like, "damn, you're fine,"

10:51.543 --> 10:53.127
but fine health-wise.

10:53.194 --> 10:55.713
My body has no fat
to protect itself from disease.

10:55.797 --> 10:57.798
Things happen very quickly.
Listen to me.

10:57.866 --> 11:00.367
It's very important
that you replenish my body

11:00.419 --> 11:01.886
with electrolytes

11:01.970 --> 11:04.221
after every involuntary loss
of bodily fluids.

11:04.306 --> 11:05.973
- Oh, boy.
- My body tends to lose

11:06.040 --> 11:08.809
a lot of fluids when it's sick.

11:08.877 --> 11:10.728
My brain is on fire.
I'm dying.

11:10.812 --> 11:13.714
Mm. Well, you definitely
have the flu.

11:13.782 --> 11:16.150
Oh, my God.

11:16.218 --> 11:18.352
The microchip
has been compromised.

11:18.420 --> 11:22.323
Pierre Garcon
was a sixth-round pick.

11:22.390 --> 11:25.159
Collie was the fourth round.

11:25.226 --> 11:27.912
Indianapolis Colts
know how to draft so well.

11:27.996 --> 11:29.163
They really do.

11:29.230 --> 11:32.466
Andy, this was delicious.

11:32.534 --> 11:33.701
It's awesome, huh?

11:33.752 --> 11:37.204
It's a whole new
meat delivery system.

11:37.272 --> 11:38.539
Thank you, son.

11:38.590 --> 11:40.407
What do you say
we go out to the parking lot,

11:40.475 --> 11:42.877
run a few pass plays
to burn off the calories?

11:42.944 --> 11:46.080
You are an unstoppable
good-idea machine!

11:47.215 --> 11:48.599
I like Andy.

11:48.683 --> 11:50.618
I'm surrounded
by a lot of women

11:50.685 --> 11:52.453
in this department.

11:52.521 --> 11:54.922
And that includes the men.

11:54.990 --> 11:58.726
Hup, hup, hup!

11:58.777 --> 12:00.444
Peyton Manning
reading the defense!

12:00.529 --> 12:01.762
Reggie Wayne, post corner!

12:03.000 --> 12:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:10.372 --> 12:11.789
Andy, wait up!

12:14.476 --> 12:15.793
Hey, April.

12:15.877 --> 12:18.779
I saw that you called for me.
What can I do for you?

12:18.830 --> 12:22.082
- I need more flu medicine.
- Oh, an actual request.

12:22.150 --> 12:24.018
Well, you can't have any.

12:24.085 --> 12:26.253
That stuff is powerful...
no extra doses.

12:26.321 --> 12:27.972
I didn't take any.

12:28.056 --> 12:30.724
Leslie came in here
and stole it and left.

12:32.727 --> 12:33.978
Leslie?

12:34.062 --> 12:37.648
Leslie!

12:37.732 --> 12:39.200
Hey, have you seen Leslie?

12:39.267 --> 12:40.768
I had a dream

12:40.835 --> 12:42.970
that she came into this room,

12:43.021 --> 12:46.507
stole my flu medicine,
told me not to tell you,

12:46.575 --> 12:48.859
and then disappeared
through that hole in the wall.

12:48.944 --> 12:50.544
The door?

12:50.612 --> 12:53.313
Maybe we should get
a suite here for them, okay?

12:53.365 --> 12:55.216
Ben Wyatt!
Hello!

12:55.283 --> 12:56.650
Uh, hi, Leslie.

12:56.701 --> 12:58.152
- Good to see you.
- You too.

12:58.220 --> 13:00.504
Wow, you're really burning up.

13:00.589 --> 13:01.705
Can I get some money

13:01.790 --> 13:03.541
for the cab that I took
over here, please?

13:03.625 --> 13:04.558
Sure.
How much?

13:04.626 --> 13:05.559
I'm not sure.

13:05.627 --> 13:06.760
I looked at the meter,

13:06.828 --> 13:09.179
and it had
Egyptian hieroglyphics on it.

13:09.264 --> 13:10.831
- Wow.
- Do you know the exchange rate?

13:10.882 --> 13:12.716
So should we do this?

13:12.801 --> 13:15.035
Oh, boy.
Hold on.

13:15.103 --> 13:16.837
- Be careful.
- What?

13:16.905 --> 13:20.341
The floor and the wall
just switched.

13:20.408 --> 13:21.775
Okay.

13:21.843 --> 13:23.978
Walk very carefully.

13:31.958 --> 13:33.500
You know, I find it a little insulting

13:33.620 --> 13:34.954
that you don't trust me
to handle this.

13:35.005 --> 13:37.290
It's not that
I don't trust you, okay?

13:37.358 --> 13:40.059
It's just... This harvest festival
is my project.

13:40.127 --> 13:42.195
It's my career on the line.

13:42.263 --> 13:43.396
And I just need to make sure

13:43.464 --> 13:46.833
that I've done everything I can
to make it work.

13:46.901 --> 13:48.651
Okay.

13:48.736 --> 13:50.170
It's showtime.

13:50.237 --> 13:51.771
Okay.

13:51.822 --> 13:53.940
Good evening, everyone.
I'm Leslie Monster.

13:53.991 --> 13:55.775
And this is <i>Nightline.</i>

13:55.826 --> 13:57.160
Okay, I wouldn't open
with that.

13:57.244 --> 13:58.328
No?

13:58.412 --> 14:00.180
- Why don't we sit down. Okay?
- Yep.

14:00.247 --> 14:04.050
Libertarianism is all
about individual liberty,

14:04.118 --> 14:05.451
and it should never be defined

14:05.519 --> 14:07.837
by the terms "liberal"
or "conservative."

14:07.922 --> 14:10.540
And communism is
no good, right?

14:10.624 --> 14:11.541
That's right.

14:11.625 --> 14:13.359
Big swing and a miss.

14:13.427 --> 14:14.494
And what's the word

14:14.562 --> 14:17.030
for when a few clerics are
in charge?

14:17.097 --> 14:18.064
Religious oligarchy.

14:18.132 --> 14:20.466
Holy [bleep].

14:20.518 --> 14:22.852
- I can remember things.
- I guess.

14:22.937 --> 14:25.405
Mm, hey, keep mine rare.

14:25.472 --> 14:28.558
A man after my own heart.

14:30.377 --> 14:33.413
I vomited
somewhere in this room.

14:33.480 --> 14:35.882
I don't remember where, though.

14:35.950 --> 14:39.586
Wait. You might want to check
that drawer.

14:39.653 --> 14:42.422
Stop...

14:42.489 --> 14:43.890
Pooping.

14:43.958 --> 14:46.059
You have to get up
off the floor now.

14:46.126 --> 14:47.427
This floor is my friend.

14:47.494 --> 14:49.996
Nothing like a complete
physical breakdown

14:50.064 --> 14:52.799
to make a guy seem
less intimidating.

14:52.867 --> 14:54.434
I love the flu.

14:54.501 --> 14:55.919
And then I said,
"uh, you know what?

14:56.003 --> 15:00.340
I think we need to get
these bananas out of here."

15:00.407 --> 15:01.641
Have a seat, boys.

15:01.709 --> 15:03.610
Oh, hey, Tom,
glad you could make it.

15:03.677 --> 15:06.045
Uh, you have a nice day
with your spa buddies?

15:06.113 --> 15:07.730
Actually, yes, Ben, I did.

15:07.815 --> 15:09.415
And my spa buddies own

15:09.483 --> 15:11.234
a couple of car dealerships
in town,

15:11.318 --> 15:12.886
and they've agreed to donate

15:12.953 --> 15:15.255
a fleet of vehicles
for harvest festival...

15:15.322 --> 15:18.124
25 vans for the entire event.

15:18.192 --> 15:20.460
Okay, Tom, I'm ready.
Get up there and introduce me.

15:20.527 --> 15:21.828
You got it.

15:21.895 --> 15:23.663
I can't let you
do this, Leslie.

15:23.731 --> 15:26.699
Hey, this ain't
your call, McCluskey.

15:26.767 --> 15:30.086
Hey, Ron,
can I ask you a question?

15:30.170 --> 15:33.106
- Sure.
- It's about April.

15:33.173 --> 15:36.409
I don't like to get involved
in people's personal...

15:36.477 --> 15:39.629
I hurt her feelings,
and now she's pissed at me.

15:39.713 --> 15:41.247
I feel like
if I could just explain myself,

15:41.298 --> 15:44.250
she'd understand,
but she's avoiding me.

15:44.318 --> 15:46.486
It's making me miserable.

15:49.456 --> 15:52.091
April's in the hospital,
sick with the flu.

15:52.142 --> 15:53.109
What?

15:53.193 --> 15:54.560
I knew it!

15:54.612 --> 15:55.778
I didn't know that.

15:55.863 --> 15:57.730
- Is she okay?
- Yeah, she's fine.

15:57.781 --> 15:59.565
You can go visit her
tomorrow morning.

15:59.633 --> 16:01.117
But don't tell her I told you.

16:01.201 --> 16:03.503
I won't.

16:03.570 --> 16:06.272
No, no.
Nope.

16:06.323 --> 16:07.273
Come here.
Ugh.

16:07.324 --> 16:08.992
Ohhh!

16:09.076 --> 16:12.445
Before we get started,
a quick announcement...

16:12.513 --> 16:15.348
Every Thursday night
is ladies' night

16:15.416 --> 16:18.751
down at the Snakehole Lounge
over on Burnham Avenue.

16:18.819 --> 16:21.254
Ladies get two drinks
for the price of one.

16:21.305 --> 16:22.822
Oh, no, that can't be right.

16:22.890 --> 16:25.425
That's way too good of a deal.

16:25.476 --> 16:27.126
Nope.

16:27.194 --> 16:29.178
That is what it says.

16:29.263 --> 16:30.179
Wow.

16:30.264 --> 16:31.648
That sounds like a fun time.

16:31.732 --> 16:33.700
Anyway, uh,

16:33.767 --> 16:35.401
it is now my great honor
to welcome to the stage

16:35.469 --> 16:38.371
the woman responsible
for the entire harvest festival.

16:38.439 --> 16:40.473
Ladies and gentlemen,
Leslie Knope!

16:53.454 --> 16:54.820
Every one of you,

16:54.872 --> 16:57.206
just by showing
up here tonight,

16:57.291 --> 16:58.624
has already made history.

16:58.676 --> 17:01.527
In days past,
the harvest festival

17:01.595 --> 17:03.212
was the cornerstone

17:03.297 --> 17:05.848
of Pawnee's
small-business community...

17:05.933 --> 17:07.467
a weeklong showcase

17:07.518 --> 17:10.803
for everything from textiles
to small farms.

17:10.854 --> 17:13.021
By our estimates,
as many as 30,000 people

17:13.107 --> 17:14.674
might attend the festival,

17:14.742 --> 17:16.075
and the monetary value

17:16.143 --> 17:18.560
of that kind of direct
customer-to-business exposure

17:18.645 --> 17:21.013
is, frankly, incalculable.

17:23.200 --> 17:25.218
What?

17:25.285 --> 17:26.752
Three, two, one.

17:26.819 --> 17:28.204
And my shift's over.

17:28.288 --> 17:30.189
What the [bleep]
is your problem?

17:30.257 --> 17:31.858
Whoa, I thought
you weren't gonna lose it.

17:31.925 --> 17:33.993
While I was on duty, I didn't.
Now it's just me.

17:34.061 --> 17:36.429
I get that you're mad
that I kissed Andy, okay?

17:36.497 --> 17:37.830
But it was a moment
of confusion,

17:37.898 --> 17:39.198
and it was a mistake.

17:39.249 --> 17:40.700
And I'm very sorry.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.085
You want to hate me forever?

17:42.169 --> 17:43.553
- Okay.
- Fine!

17:43.637 --> 17:44.937
You know what?
I don't care.

17:45.005 --> 17:46.372
But you shouldn't take it out
on Andy,

17:46.440 --> 17:48.874
because he really likes you,
and he did nothing wrong.

17:48.926 --> 17:52.211
And just for the record,
I'm starting to hate you too.

17:54.948 --> 17:57.683
That's the most
I've ever liked Ann.

17:57.735 --> 17:59.769
The time is now.

17:59.853 --> 18:01.904
The place is Pawnee.

18:01.989 --> 18:04.223
Let's make history.

18:06.160 --> 18:08.745
That was amazing.

18:08.829 --> 18:10.396
That was a flu-ridden
Michael Jordan

18:10.464 --> 18:12.598
at the '97 NBA finals.

18:12.666 --> 18:14.233
That was...

18:14.284 --> 18:16.035
Kirk Gibson
hobbling up to the plate

18:16.103 --> 18:17.587
and hitting a homer
off of Dennis Eckersley.

18:17.671 --> 18:20.740
That was...

18:20.808 --> 18:23.476
That was Leslie Knope.

18:23.544 --> 18:25.745
Thank you so much.
Any questions?

18:25.813 --> 18:27.463
Yes, sir?

18:27.548 --> 18:30.149
Are we going to get
the same sales-tax incentives

18:30.217 --> 18:31.267
we used to?

18:31.351 --> 18:33.186
That's a very good
question, sir,

18:33.253 --> 18:36.255
and I would counter
with my own question, which is,

18:36.306 --> 18:38.808
why is half of your face
all swirly?

18:38.892 --> 18:40.293
Okay, um, unfortunately,

18:40.360 --> 18:43.312
Leslie has another very
important meeting right now.

18:43.397 --> 18:44.814
So if you have
any other questions,

18:44.898 --> 18:46.599
you can just direct them,
uh, towards me.

18:46.667 --> 18:47.817
Give it up, everybody,

18:47.901 --> 18:49.602
for Scott Bakula
from <i>Quantum Leap.</i>

18:49.653 --> 18:52.038
All right.
Okay, let's...

18:52.105 --> 18:53.906
Excuse me.

18:53.957 --> 18:56.509
Um, and to answer
your question, sir,

18:56.577 --> 18:58.411
there will be
sales-tax incentives this year.

18:58.479 --> 18:59.912
I think I should drive you
to the hospital.

18:59.980 --> 19:01.581
Was I wearing a tiara
when I came in here?

19:01.648 --> 19:03.116
Because if you happen upon it,

19:03.183 --> 19:04.717
will you have Lady Pennyface
retrieve it

19:04.785 --> 19:06.119
and send it posthence?

19:06.186 --> 19:07.220
Chocolate-covered popcorn.

19:09.956 --> 19:11.974
- Oh, hey.
- Hey, there.

19:12.059 --> 19:14.227
I got you, uh,
some waffles here,

19:14.294 --> 19:16.095
courtesy of JJ's diner,

19:16.146 --> 19:17.897
and chicken soup,
courtesy of me.

19:17.964 --> 19:19.816
- I'll take the waffles.
- Okay.

19:19.900 --> 19:22.235
Thank you.

19:22.302 --> 19:23.903
So how did the rest
of the meeting go?

19:23.970 --> 19:26.823
Um, well, you said you needed

19:26.907 --> 19:28.474
80 total businesses
to participate.

19:28.525 --> 19:30.076
Yeah.

19:30.143 --> 19:31.244
We have 110...

19:31.311 --> 19:32.612
And counting.

19:32.663 --> 19:34.980
So, uh, nice work, Leslie.

19:35.032 --> 19:36.999
- Nice work to you too.
- Oh.

19:37.084 --> 19:39.285
Uh, left the chicken soup there,
just in case.

19:39.336 --> 19:41.537
It's an old family recipe.

19:41.622 --> 19:44.123
It's not a big deal, but...

19:44.174 --> 19:46.292
- Thank you for that.
- Okay.

19:50.848 --> 19:52.164
Hi, April.

19:52.216 --> 19:54.050
It's me, Andy.

19:54.134 --> 19:56.519
Just stay sleeping.

19:56.603 --> 20:00.339
I am going to be here
when you wake up.

20:00.407 --> 20:02.441
I will not leave your side.

20:07.347 --> 20:11.734
You could be asleep for hours.
Maybe I'll come back later.

20:11.818 --> 20:14.019
Hope you feel better.
Okay.

20:14.071 --> 20:16.455
Oh, and I know you think
that I'm a jerk,

20:16.523 --> 20:19.158
but I hope you can forgive me.

20:22.746 --> 20:24.463
Gross.
Your forehead is all sweaty.

20:24.531 --> 20:26.048
That's gross.

20:28.135 --> 20:29.969
But I still like you.

20:30.036 --> 20:31.037
Okay.

20:31.104 --> 20:33.038
Oh, that's disgusting.

20:40.557 --> 20:41.674
Got your message.
What's up?

20:41.758 --> 20:43.476
I got a call
from the boys upstairs.

20:44.064 --> 20:45.726
And they have
a new assignment for us.

20:45.846 --> 20:46.890
- Okay.
- Yeah.

20:47.010 --> 20:50.387
And I feel like we should ask
for an extension to stay here.

20:50.706 --> 20:52.087
Yes, definitely.
You know...

20:52.207 --> 20:54.092
The festival thing's
getting pretty huge,

20:54.120 --> 20:56.717
and, uh, couple loose ends
that need tying up.

20:56.837 --> 20:59.077
Good, so I'll make the call,
then, to get the extension?

20:59.123 --> 21:00.580
- Yeah, they need our help.
- For the loose ends.

21:00.700 --> 21:01.644
- Great.
- Good.

21:01.695 --> 21:03.556
Okay, you need
a ride back to the office?

21:03.607 --> 21:05.576
No, no, I'm gonna go
for a light 15k.

21:05.696 --> 21:06.653
I missed yesterday.

21:08.121 --> 21:09.475
Way to go, buddy.
Way to go.
