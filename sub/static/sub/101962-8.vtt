00:00.200 --> 00:02.320
If our baby is a witch
born of daemons,

00:02.480 --> 00:03.800
she'll be everything
the congregation fears

00:03.960 --> 00:05.600
and wants to destroy.

00:05.760 --> 00:07.720
Well, she's gotthe Knights
of Lazarus to protect her.

00:09.160 --> 00:11.040
-I'm serious.
-They need a rebrand, mate.

00:11.200 --> 00:13.880
And you have got
your work cut out for you.

00:14.040 --> 00:16.720
The Knights did some
amazing things a long time ago.

00:16.880 --> 00:18.360
What's their relevance today?

00:18.520 --> 00:21.280
You're Grand Master.
That's for you to decide.

00:21.440 --> 00:23.920
A vampire
is murdering warmbloods.

00:24.080 --> 00:26.600
Whoever is doing this
is infected with blood rage.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.280
<i>These are dangerous times.</i>

00:28.440 --> 00:30.120
The Knights may be needed
at any moment

00:30.280 --> 00:32.720
and they need an experienced,
committed leader.

00:32.880 --> 00:35.960
-Matthew didn't give me a choice.
-He's been lying to you your whole life.

00:36.120 --> 00:39.000
-Matthew!
-This is what we call a blood rage!

00:39.160 --> 00:42.320
The disease is in my bloodline.
You and I are carriers.

00:42.480 --> 00:45.200
You all knew
and you kept it from me.

00:45.360 --> 00:46.680
<i>If we're linked to the murders,</i>

00:46.840 --> 00:49.080
<i>it will be the end</i>
<i>of the de Clermonts.</i>

00:49.240 --> 00:50.840
<i>Do you have any leads yet?</i>

00:51.000 --> 00:53.800
I did a lot of researchon those
portraits,

00:53.960 --> 00:57.280
but could never
pin their exact origin down.

00:57.440 --> 00:59.240
Whatever it is, just tell me.

00:59.400 --> 01:02.040
I'm a vampire.

01:02.200 --> 01:03.520
Come on, Marcus.

01:03.680 --> 01:05.880
<i>No, Phoebe, seriously,</i>
<i>I'm hundreds of years old.</i>

01:06.040 --> 01:07.440
Goodbye, Marcus.

01:07.600 --> 01:10.120
You can find out what's inside that book
and why it's connected to Diana.

01:10.280 --> 01:12.680
How do we do that exactly?
We only have one page.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.480
<i>We need to connect</i>
<i>with someone who did.</i>

01:14.640 --> 01:16.920
<i>-We know Stephen did.</i>
<i>-Maybe Rebecca did too.</i>

01:17.080 --> 01:20.640
If you're proposing to summon
the dead, forget about it.

01:23.200 --> 01:25.120
Stop screaming!

01:26.800 --> 01:29.800
<i>This books is made from the skin of</i>
<i>creatures, witches, daemons, vampires.</i>

01:29.960 --> 01:32.920
I'm sorry, Diana. But this is
more like a book of death.

02:07.320 --> 02:11.000
I've been trying to understand it,
but it's resisting me.

02:11.160 --> 02:14.840
The harder I try,
the stranger I feel.

02:16.680 --> 02:19.920
It's making you ill.
Stop.

02:23.440 --> 02:27.280
Francoise has prepared some
food for you downstairs.

02:27.440 --> 02:29.960
-I'm not hungry.
-I don't care.

02:40.920 --> 02:43.680
-All right.
-Thank you.

02:59.880 --> 03:03.880
I've located a letter
written by Edward Kelley.

03:04.040 --> 03:06.120
Give me the edited highlights.

03:06.280 --> 03:11.320
It proves your theory that the Book Of
Life was in his possession in 1591.

03:11.480 --> 03:15.400
It also reveals that he tore
three of its pages out.

03:17.680 --> 03:20.400
Kelley claims to have
bequeathed a single page

03:20.560 --> 03:23.360
to each of the three species.

03:26.760 --> 03:29.720
Which would explain why I
couldn't summon up the Book...

03:29.880 --> 03:31.760
It's incomplete.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.520
Diana Bishop managed it.

03:34.680 --> 03:37.000
Perhaps she already had a page?

03:37.160 --> 03:38.840
If we could find one,

03:39.000 --> 03:41.960
it might help us call it
up from the Bodleian.

03:42.120 --> 03:46.960
The vampire page could already be
in the hands of the de Clermonts.

03:48.640 --> 03:50.920
I'll speak to Ysabeau.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.040
And the witches' page?

03:56.800 --> 03:59.200
I'm investigating.

06:37.520 --> 06:39.760
It's all right.
I'm coming.

06:43.200 --> 06:45.880
You've been avoiding me.

06:49.640 --> 06:53.760
-Matthew was trying to...
-To protect me?

06:53.920 --> 06:57.480
Yeah, I've already heard that
bullshit excuse from Ysabeau.

06:58.360 --> 07:00.560
I had a right to know.

07:00.720 --> 07:03.200
Philippe wanted
blood rage eradicated

07:03.360 --> 07:06.440
to prevent humans
discovering our existence.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.880
To protect Ysabeau's secret.

07:10.040 --> 07:11.920
So he used Matthew as his assassin.

07:12.080 --> 07:14.160
Well, then, why didn't
he just kill me?

07:14.320 --> 07:16.600
He failed to follow orders.

07:19.360 --> 07:21.440
You should know by now...

07:21.600 --> 07:25.120
With Matthew, actions
speak louder than words.

07:25.280 --> 07:27.360
He lied to me.

07:28.160 --> 07:30.520
-You all did.
-It wasn't my right to tell.

07:30.680 --> 07:32.440
You've been my friend
for over 200 years...

07:32.600 --> 07:35.520
I'm not family.

07:37.880 --> 07:40.320
You know what?
I'm done with all this.

07:41.920 --> 07:44.200
With my family, with the Knights.

07:44.360 --> 07:47.200
If Baldwin wants to be Grand
Master, then he can have it.

07:47.360 --> 07:50.480
In fact, you know what,
this is great.

07:50.640 --> 07:53.480
Because this has helped me
realize what's important to me.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.600
My friends, my work...

07:59.320 --> 08:01.400
My human life.

08:01.560 --> 08:04.720
Whoever that belongs to,
she's not worth it.

08:08.760 --> 08:10.840
You can't deny what you are, Marcus.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.760
Well, apparently I've been
doing that my whole life.

08:29.640 --> 08:33.360
Marcus, I'm working.
You can't just turn up.

08:33.520 --> 08:36.760
Fine, I'll buy something.
What have you got?

08:36.920 --> 08:38.840
Marcus.

08:40.400 --> 08:42.920
You left this.

08:43.080 --> 08:47.200
-It feels expensive.
-Thank you.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.520
And I was telling the truth, by the way.

08:50.680 --> 08:54.760
Look, if I want stories, I've got
a library full of books at home.

08:54.920 --> 08:57.000
I want you to look at this.

09:03.400 --> 09:07.320
This is the property
of the Knights of Lazarus,

09:07.480 --> 09:11.520
an organization dating
back to the 12th century.

09:18.840 --> 09:21.240
I'm Grand Master of the Knights.

09:21.400 --> 09:24.880
-And I'm Princess Leia.
-Research it.

09:25.040 --> 09:26.920
Run your tests on it.

09:27.080 --> 09:31.440
All you'll find are questions.
And when it's time for answers,

09:31.600 --> 09:33.040
you know where I am.

09:55.600 --> 09:59.400
My whole life I've been
taught to hide who I am.

10:00.120 --> 10:03.080
Not let the humans suspect. And...

10:03.240 --> 10:07.080
Now I wanna convince one,
she won't believe me.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.920
They only see what they want.

10:09.080 --> 10:10.760
The only thing you can
do now is give her time.

10:10.920 --> 10:13.080
I've got all
the time in the world.

10:13.240 --> 10:15.840
I just don't want to wait.

10:16.640 --> 10:20.720
I feel for you, buddy.
But this is personal growth.

10:20.880 --> 10:24.840
You spent hundreds of years being a
bachelor and now you're finally over it.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.720
Hey, Soph.
Can I get you something?

10:28.880 --> 10:30.520
I think the baby's coming.

10:30.680 --> 10:33.000
She can't be.
She's not due for weeks.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.080
Shepherd
my guiding spirits

10:40.240 --> 10:43.520
and bind me to the person
in my thoughts.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.520
Rebecca?

11:10.800 --> 11:12.800
Honey, is that you?

11:13.840 --> 11:15.280
Yes...

11:16.280 --> 11:17.760
I'm here.

11:19.520 --> 11:22.720
-Emily.
-I need your help.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.520
The book... How is it
connected to Diana?

11:28.400 --> 11:31.400
Oh! No, no, no... Wait, wait, wait.
Come back!

11:42.840 --> 11:44.240
Higher magic?
We talked about this.

11:44.400 --> 11:46.400
What the hell were you thinking?

11:46.560 --> 11:48.560
Rebecca has a message for me.

11:48.720 --> 11:51.680
It's like she's been
waiting for me to do this,

11:51.840 --> 11:53.800
and willing me on,
trying to help me.

11:53.960 --> 11:55.680
I can...
I can just feel it.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.800
Sarah, I heard her voice.

11:58.960 --> 12:01.360
-If I could just talk to her...
-Stop.

12:01.520 --> 12:04.280
She's trying to draw me in,
to help me understand something.

12:04.440 --> 12:06.120
Higher magic is drawing
you in, it's addictive.

12:06.280 --> 12:07.640
What are you doing?
What are you...

12:07.800 --> 12:10.560
I'm putting this in a
safe place away from you.

12:10.720 --> 12:12.880
Honey, you could help me.

12:13.040 --> 12:17.360
There is a sacred site,
right outside the chateau walls.

12:17.520 --> 12:20.520
-I can feel its power sometimes...
-Why aren't you listening to me?

12:20.680 --> 12:22.560
Honey, don't you want to help Diana?

12:22.720 --> 12:24.760
Not if it kills you in the process!

12:24.920 --> 12:27.240
Look,
anything can come through.

12:27.400 --> 12:30.960
It's using you, it's showing
you what you want to see.

12:31.120 --> 12:33.280
You know how dangerous that is.

12:33.440 --> 12:35.880
You have to stop.

12:37.600 --> 12:39.800
You don't understand.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.400
You don't understand, Sarah.

12:42.560 --> 12:44.480
Don't you walk away from this!

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
It's time to choose
your side, Ysabeau.

12:58.680 --> 13:01.120
I'm not engaging
with your games, Gerbert.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.880
<i>If you have the Ashmole pages,</i>

13:03.040 --> 13:08.640
I'll tear down that chateau
brick by brick to find them.

13:08.800 --> 13:12.440
You'd do well to remember
who you're threatening.

13:24.640 --> 13:27.480
I know.
I shouldn't be out here.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.360
I thought you might like this.

13:36.120 --> 13:37.960
Thank you.

13:38.120 --> 13:40.400
Never sleep on an argument.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.360
It's time to push now.

13:53.520 --> 13:56.960
I need you to push
with every contraction.

13:59.360 --> 14:02.360
-That's it, good.
-Come on. I love you so much.

14:03.360 --> 14:06.200
-You can do it. Come on.
-Push.

14:06.360 --> 14:08.480
Good girl.
Come on.

14:09.960 --> 14:14.240
Well done. She's coming, she's coming.
I can see her. Come on.

14:15.120 --> 14:18.800
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

14:18.960 --> 14:21.800
Push. Good.

14:27.840 --> 14:31.320
And here she is.
Well done, Sophie.

14:31.480 --> 14:33.240
Well done, Sophie.

14:33.400 --> 14:35.400
-She's here.
-Well done.

14:35.560 --> 14:37.440
Well done.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Is she all right?

14:53.080 --> 14:54.920
She's perfect.

14:58.640 --> 15:00.960
Here you go, my dear.

15:12.840 --> 15:15.040
Oh.

15:43.520 --> 15:45.960
-Good night, Wilf.
-Good night.

16:02.040 --> 16:04.560
I need you
to look at something.

16:05.880 --> 16:07.760
What is it?

16:07.920 --> 16:09.800
You tell me.

16:13.160 --> 16:16.200
It's extraordinary.
Where did you get it?

16:16.360 --> 16:18.280
A new client.

16:19.200 --> 16:21.840
I don't recognize the emblem.

16:25.520 --> 16:27.640
Leave it with me.

17:00.680 --> 17:04.160
-I'm just going down to the vault.
-Okay.

17:22.960 --> 17:25.520
Sorry. Didn't mean
to startle you.

17:25.680 --> 17:28.760
I just have some questions
about the robbery.

17:28.920 --> 17:30.760
You're police.

17:30.920 --> 17:33.160
Right, sorry.

17:34.200 --> 17:37.520
I was just thinking about the
force required to open this door.

17:37.680 --> 17:41.280
I know the stolen goods
are late 16th century,

17:41.440 --> 17:43.040
but do you have an accurate date?

17:43.200 --> 17:44.520
No, I...

17:44.680 --> 17:48.760
I already explained this
in my statement.

17:48.920 --> 17:50.240
Would you like to come to my office?

17:50.400 --> 17:53.000
What did Marcus Whitmore
tell you about them?

17:53.160 --> 17:56.600
-Marcus?
-You've been socializing.

17:57.680 --> 18:01.760
I'm sorry, I didn't quite
catch your name... Detective?

18:03.960 --> 18:05.920
Have you found Joe?

18:06.800 --> 18:10.280
-You're not a police officer.
-Phoebe.

18:10.440 --> 18:13.960
-Sorry, am I interrupting?
-No. Not at all.

18:17.360 --> 18:20.360
I think it's Plantagenet.
Maybe even older.

18:20.520 --> 18:23.680
I've WhatsApped Louise, and she's going
to give us a second opinion tomorrow.

18:23.840 --> 18:25.800
Where did you get that?

18:26.600 --> 18:29.320
Marcus gave it to me.

18:29.480 --> 18:32.480
He's the Grand Master
of the Knights of Lazarus.

18:37.360 --> 18:40.040
Well, thank you for your help.

19:04.040 --> 19:06.120
Can we call a truce?

19:32.960 --> 19:34.760
Everything all right?

19:38.120 --> 19:40.440
Sophie did an amazing job.

19:40.600 --> 19:42.800
She is so beautiful.

19:43.600 --> 19:44.920
I'm a dad.

19:46.360 --> 19:47.920
Bloody hell, I'm a dad.

19:50.640 --> 19:53.080
You guys thought
about a name yet?

19:53.240 --> 19:55.120
Margaret.

19:56.080 --> 19:57.440
Seriously?

19:57.600 --> 19:59.280
We like it.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.880
Why, hey, Margaret.

20:08.800 --> 20:11.080
-Is she all right?
-Yeah.

20:12.440 --> 20:15.040
The baby's blood is singing.

20:15.200 --> 20:17.400
That confirms she's a witch.

20:17.560 --> 20:20.840
The Congregation
can't be allowed to find her.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.800
Once the doctor's given
the all clear,

20:22.960 --> 20:25.200
you should move to
Sept-Tours for a while.

20:26.280 --> 20:30.160
You can decide what to do in the
long-term once the dust has settled.

20:32.280 --> 20:35.760
If she'll be safer there,
then, yeah, of course.

20:41.560 --> 20:44.240
<i>I remember</i>
<i>watching you and Rebecca</i>

20:44.400 --> 20:46.480
<i>doing your higher magic.</i>

20:46.640 --> 20:51.600
I'd practice in my room,
keep failing, over and over.

20:52.480 --> 20:57.920
I was so desperate to surprise you,
to be part of it.

20:59.840 --> 21:01.960
Rebecca wanted to include you.

21:02.120 --> 21:05.120
I know. I wouldn't let her.

21:05.280 --> 21:07.520
You were so goddamn stubborn.

21:07.680 --> 21:10.440
I resented higher magic.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.840
It kept me apart from her.

21:19.480 --> 21:21.400
She loved you, honey.

21:24.080 --> 21:27.160
I don't want that to happen to us.

21:33.200 --> 21:35.560
How do you feel
about a jailbreak tonight?

21:35.720 --> 21:39.120
You're right. We need to
know more about the page.

21:39.280 --> 21:40.840
Serious?

21:41.000 --> 21:43.720
We could find your sacred site.

21:47.680 --> 21:50.480
Honey, I don't think it's far.

21:50.640 --> 21:53.960
Em, if I can just harness its power,

21:54.120 --> 21:56.760
I know it can help me go deeper.
I know...

21:56.920 --> 22:01.000
Okay. I'm not gonna pretend
it doesn't frighten me.

22:01.880 --> 22:04.240
But I don't want you
to do this alone.

22:08.800 --> 22:10.960
Okay.

22:12.920 --> 22:14.960
Thank you.

22:31.480 --> 22:33.760
I'm ready for answers.

22:35.280 --> 22:37.640
This looks like the
man in those portraits.

22:37.800 --> 22:40.400
That's my father,
Matthew de Clermont.

22:40.560 --> 22:44.120
The man who sired me,
well, who turned me into a vampire.

22:44.280 --> 22:47.840
That's why you wanted
the miniatures so badly.

22:48.720 --> 22:51.080
And who's the woman?

22:51.240 --> 22:53.240
Diana Bishop.

22:53.400 --> 22:54.840
She's a witch.

22:55.840 --> 22:58.280
Yeah. It's a long story.

22:58.960 --> 23:02.200
But those miniatures
and this artwork,

23:02.360 --> 23:05.240
they were painted
hundreds of years apart.

23:08.840 --> 23:12.320
So, those photos
from the other night,

23:14.240 --> 23:16.920
they were all of you.

23:17.080 --> 23:18.680
Yeah.

23:23.400 --> 23:26.280
When were you born?

23:28.280 --> 23:30.600
1757.

23:32.200 --> 23:34.440
But Matthew sired me in 1781.

23:34.600 --> 23:36.480
And how did it happen?

23:36.640 --> 23:40.400
I was a surgeon's assistant in the
Continental Army, dying of fever.

23:40.560 --> 23:42.480
Matthew offered me survival

23:42.640 --> 23:44.760
and I took it.

23:45.800 --> 23:50.400
Do you like it?
Being a... Uh...

23:50.560 --> 23:53.440
I do, yeah.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.800
It can be lonely sometimes.

23:55.960 --> 23:58.640
But your family, your human family,

23:58.800 --> 24:02.000
they died hundreds
of years ago, right?

24:04.360 --> 24:07.120
I have a vampire family now.

24:07.280 --> 24:10.520
-But human friends?
-Of course.

24:10.680 --> 24:14.800
And do any of them know
what you are?

24:18.320 --> 24:20.440
Only you.

24:22.800 --> 24:24.960
Give me your hand.

24:33.520 --> 24:36.040
Oh, it's not beating.

24:44.920 --> 24:46.840
It beats slower.

24:48.520 --> 24:51.240
And it loves longer.

25:03.680 --> 25:08.520
We eat raw meats
and rare if we're in company.

25:08.680 --> 25:13.160
And some nuts and berries.
But we don't really crave food.

25:13.320 --> 25:15.640
You crave blood.

25:16.720 --> 25:18.440
Do you crave my blood?

25:18.600 --> 25:20.280
You're not in
any danger from me.

25:20.440 --> 25:25.680
No, but do you bite people?
Is that how you feed?

25:25.840 --> 25:30.960
Generally, we try not to feed
on humans anymore.

25:32.840 --> 25:34.840
Animals?

25:35.000 --> 25:36.560
I work in A&E.

25:36.720 --> 25:39.320
The blood in your fridge.

25:39.480 --> 25:42.640
-Do you just, like, glug it down?
-Yep.

25:42.800 --> 25:46.160
-What, straight from the bag?
-No! In a mug.

25:46.320 --> 25:48.680
I'm not a heathen.

25:48.840 --> 25:50.880
So I've met creatures before.

25:51.040 --> 25:54.040
Yeah. Met.
Worked with.

25:54.200 --> 25:56.640
Maybe even loved.

25:56.800 --> 25:59.520
There used to be a lot more of us,

25:59.680 --> 26:02.040
but our numbers are dwindling.

26:03.240 --> 26:08.280
-We're slowly dying out.
-That's awful. Why?

26:08.440 --> 26:10.160
We don't really know.

26:10.320 --> 26:13.920
Some vampires are unable to sire,

26:14.080 --> 26:17.720
witches are losing their powers,
many daemons are driven to madness.

26:17.880 --> 26:21.320
But right now, it's a mystery.

26:21.480 --> 26:24.080
You know, there was a time
many millennia ago

26:24.240 --> 26:27.320
where 50% of the population
were non-human,

26:27.480 --> 26:29.160
and we all intermingled.

26:29.320 --> 26:34.200
But the humans grew afraid
of the "other."

26:34.360 --> 26:36.120
We still are.

26:36.280 --> 26:38.840
Technologically,
you're advancing so fast,

26:39.000 --> 26:41.360
but socially?
You're going backwards,

26:41.520 --> 26:44.600
building walls
and enforcing borders.

26:44.760 --> 26:48.440
Human prejudice is worse than ever.

26:51.360 --> 26:53.640
Who is the oldest vampire
you've ever met?

26:53.800 --> 26:56.040
My grandfather Philippe.

26:57.080 --> 27:00.960
He never told anyone how long he'd
been around, but it was millennia.

27:01.960 --> 27:05.600
He saw the whole
of modern human history.

27:06.840 --> 27:10.640
He died in the 1940s.

27:12.680 --> 27:15.160
But my grandmother has seen it too.

27:24.480 --> 27:28.480
I remember when Blankers-Koen
won her fourth gold medal.

27:28.640 --> 27:31.200
Ysabeau was ecstatic.

27:35.200 --> 27:36.640
So...

27:36.800 --> 27:39.640
-So she was with...
-Philippe.

27:39.800 --> 27:42.920
...for thousands of years.

27:43.760 --> 27:46.560
It must have broken her heart
when he died.

27:46.720 --> 27:48.680
Yeah.

27:48.840 --> 27:50.760
And what about you?

27:50.920 --> 27:53.640
You're hundreds of years old.

27:53.800 --> 27:57.200
You must've lost
lots of human friends.

27:59.600 --> 28:01.520
Your lives are short.

28:01.680 --> 28:05.800
Most of us try and move on from
place to place, every few decades.

28:05.960 --> 28:10.960
Create new identities,
make new connections.

28:11.120 --> 28:13.040
It's easier that way.

28:20.080 --> 28:21.440
Well...

28:21.600 --> 28:25.200
Turns out vampires
make amazing hot chocolate.

28:28.320 --> 28:30.520
So...

28:30.680 --> 28:33.480
What else should I know?

28:36.720 --> 28:39.160
<i>We heal quicker.</i>

28:40.440 --> 28:43.560
<i>Our senses are heightened.</i>

28:45.960 --> 28:48.520
<i>We're stronger,</i>

28:49.560 --> 28:50.920
<i>faster.</i>

28:51.080 --> 28:54.320
Okay, nearest supermarket's
two blocks away, right?

28:54.480 --> 28:57.000
Okay. I fancy an ice cream.

28:57.160 --> 28:59.920
Salted caramel.

29:00.080 --> 29:01.680
Oh, Marcus?

29:03.920 --> 29:05.880
I'm timing.

29:17.840 --> 29:19.240
Fifty-six seconds.

29:19.400 --> 29:21.320
There was a queue at the till.

29:24.080 --> 29:26.560
Oh, my God, can you
change into a bat?

29:26.720 --> 29:28.080
No.

29:28.240 --> 29:30.400
And we don't sleep
in coffins either.

29:30.560 --> 29:32.960
-Or wear capes.
-Well, that's a shame.

29:33.120 --> 29:35.080
-I like a cape.
-Yeah?

29:36.400 --> 29:39.320
What about these guys?
The Knights?

29:39.480 --> 29:43.800
A guy came into my work asking
questions about the robbery.

29:43.960 --> 29:47.200
I think maybe he was a vampire.

29:48.320 --> 29:49.640
That's Domenico.

29:49.800 --> 29:53.640
He recognized that emblem.
He respected it.

29:53.800 --> 29:58.480
As all vampires would.
The Knights are a noble institution.

29:58.640 --> 30:01.280
That you're in charge of.

30:04.280 --> 30:06.600
Not anymore.

30:08.080 --> 30:10.320
I'm giving it up.

30:10.480 --> 30:12.160
The longer we live,

30:12.320 --> 30:15.760
the more anachronistic
our culture becomes.

30:16.800 --> 30:18.120
Stuck in the past.

30:18.280 --> 30:21.840
Everything you've told me
sounds amazing.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.320
I was the son of a farmer,

30:24.480 --> 30:27.120
an American revolutionary.

30:27.280 --> 30:29.320
I know what I believe in.

30:29.480 --> 30:32.040
I've got my work, my friends.

30:32.200 --> 30:34.720
I don't need anything else.

30:36.360 --> 30:39.880
You see...
I don't buy it.

30:40.040 --> 30:42.600
You could've had
any life you wanted,

30:42.760 --> 30:45.960
but you chose to be a doctor.

30:46.120 --> 30:48.240
To help humans.

30:48.400 --> 30:50.520
That's the kind of man you are.

30:50.680 --> 30:54.040
You couldn't turn your back
on your own species.

30:54.200 --> 30:58.680
Look, you were born in revolution.

30:58.840 --> 31:01.600
If you disagree
with creature politics

31:01.760 --> 31:04.000
or infrastructure, change it.

31:04.160 --> 31:07.440
Fix it like you fix your patients.

31:07.600 --> 31:11.560
Use the Knights to help everyone.

31:12.440 --> 31:15.520
For future generations.

31:23.440 --> 31:25.480
All you have to do is
name me Grand Master

31:25.640 --> 31:27.000
and the transition of power is...

31:27.160 --> 31:28.880
I can't do that.

31:30.880 --> 31:33.960
Sorry, but I'm keeping it.

31:34.120 --> 31:36.600
I'll be using the Knights
to make positive change,

31:36.760 --> 31:39.480
for all creatures.

31:46.440 --> 31:51.160
The Knights of Lazarus were formed
to protect de Clermont interests.

31:52.880 --> 31:54.760
It's not a charity.

31:54.920 --> 31:57.840
You still have an
important part to play.

31:59.360 --> 32:01.120
I need your help.

32:02.200 --> 32:03.880
To do what?

32:07.000 --> 32:08.760
Not here.

32:15.040 --> 32:19.040
A witch, born to daemons.

32:19.200 --> 32:20.880
The family have done nothing wrong,

32:21.040 --> 32:24.000
but they'll have to live
their entire lives in hiding

32:24.160 --> 32:26.360
unless we do something.

32:27.680 --> 32:29.440
If this is true,

32:29.600 --> 32:31.800
the witches will want the child

32:31.960 --> 32:34.160
and the Congregation
will support them.

32:34.320 --> 32:36.560
My first act as Grand Master

32:36.720 --> 32:39.920
will be to protect her
and the family.

32:40.920 --> 32:42.800
Now, if word of this
gets to the Congregation,

32:42.960 --> 32:45.760
I will need your help
to divert attention.

32:45.920 --> 32:50.440
We have a blood-raged
killer on our hands

32:50.600 --> 32:53.720
and you're worried
about fucking daemons?

32:53.880 --> 32:57.760
-They're my friends.
-Listen to yourself.

32:57.920 --> 33:00.720
You've spent too much
time with humans.

33:00.880 --> 33:04.120
-You're practically one of them.
-Because I've got a conscience?

33:04.280 --> 33:08.480
No.
It's 'cause you're soft.

33:08.640 --> 33:11.160
And you're stupid.

33:11.320 --> 33:15.640
-As Grand Master...
-I don't take orders from infants!

33:17.640 --> 33:21.320
Your ideology is contaminated.

33:21.480 --> 33:23.600
Like your blood.

33:24.800 --> 33:27.240
I already know I'm a carrier.

33:33.160 --> 33:38.640
Philippe should've culled every member
of Ysabeau's verminous blood line,

33:38.800 --> 33:40.600
including you.

33:42.600 --> 33:45.720
I actually understand now...

33:50.120 --> 33:55.080
why Philippe was always
so disappointed in you.

34:05.160 --> 34:07.640
I trust you're here
with solid information.

34:07.800 --> 34:09.360
Or the killer's head.

34:09.520 --> 34:12.040
I've established a connection
I think will interest you.

34:12.200 --> 34:14.880
Suspense doesn't work for me,
Domenico. Get to the point.

34:15.040 --> 34:17.360
First, we need to agree terms.

34:19.600 --> 34:23.320
-We already have.
-My price just went up.

34:24.240 --> 34:26.120
I won't be held to ransom
by you or anybody else.

34:26.280 --> 34:28.040
And I don't take orders.
I'm the one on the ground

34:28.200 --> 34:30.520
and I am this close
to identifying the killer.

34:30.680 --> 34:33.760
That's not close enough.

34:34.760 --> 34:37.680
Now there's something
you don't see every day.

34:39.600 --> 34:41.680
Don't overplay your hand,

34:41.840 --> 34:44.680
or I may end up reneging
on our deal.

34:46.360 --> 34:48.000
I'll be waiting.

34:50.440 --> 34:52.640
Impudent fucker.

34:56.240 --> 34:58.640
What's the Whitmore boy doing here?

34:58.800 --> 35:01.160
Next time, knock
before you stroll in.

35:01.320 --> 35:03.840
No other de Clermont sets foot on
this island without good reason.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.720
It's a family matter.

35:09.400 --> 35:11.960
Oxford? Tell me, how was the
weather during your visit?

35:12.120 --> 35:13.680
Whitmore lives there,
doesn't he? Matthew too,

35:13.840 --> 35:16.080
when he's not gallivanting
through time.

35:16.240 --> 35:19.440
I'd hate to assume you were part
of some de Clermont conspiracy

35:19.600 --> 35:21.520
involving blood rage.

35:23.120 --> 35:26.800
Whatever you know,
you should tell me

35:26.960 --> 35:28.840
now.

35:32.880 --> 35:35.440
He's protecting a child.

35:37.040 --> 35:38.560
What child?

35:40.480 --> 35:42.360
Are you scared?

35:44.840 --> 35:46.960
No.

35:47.120 --> 35:48.600
You?

35:49.640 --> 35:54.200
Not for us. For her.
Her future.

35:55.200 --> 35:57.520
The world is so messed up right now.

36:01.200 --> 36:03.360
Maybe she'll help fix it.

36:19.920 --> 36:22.240
There's a link

36:22.400 --> 36:25.520
between Matthew
and the Oxford murders.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.360
See, I saw the stolen portraits.

36:28.520 --> 36:31.440
Sixteenth century, worst
holiday destination ever.

36:31.600 --> 36:35.120
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

36:37.000 --> 36:41.040
Sooner or later I'll catch
the Oxford vampire.

36:41.200 --> 36:44.920
Their identity and my
loyalty will be for sale.

36:45.080 --> 36:46.440
In exchange for what?

36:46.600 --> 36:50.480
You're Grand Master
of the Knights Of Lazarus.

36:50.640 --> 36:52.840
I'm sure you'll think of something.

36:53.000 --> 36:56.520
But when you actually
have something to sell,

36:56.680 --> 36:58.320
come and talk to me.

37:08.640 --> 37:12.640
A witch born to daemons?
It's unheard of.

37:12.800 --> 37:14.800
And as it's a witch,

37:14.960 --> 37:19.040
the child is entirely
under your jurisdiction.

37:19.200 --> 37:22.600
How do I know it isn't
a wild goose chase?

37:22.760 --> 37:27.880
Don't pretend you're not
chomping at the bit to find out.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.560
You took your time...

37:42.720 --> 37:44.680
Oh, sorry.

37:44.840 --> 37:47.160
Can we help you?

37:49.880 --> 37:51.400
Nat!

37:51.560 --> 37:54.320
Sleep now.

38:03.360 --> 38:05.840
Hush now.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.560
You have nothing to fear.

38:19.880 --> 38:22.120
Well. This is a surprise.

38:22.280 --> 38:23.800
What have you done to them?

38:23.960 --> 38:27.760
-They'll live.
-Get the hell away from her.

38:27.920 --> 38:30.800
Such a special child.

38:30.960 --> 38:33.600
I'm here to confirm
the child's existence.

38:33.760 --> 38:36.600
The arrangements
will follow at a later date.

38:36.760 --> 38:38.880
What arrangements?

38:39.040 --> 38:40.520
She's a witch,

38:40.680 --> 38:43.560
so she'll be raised
by her own species.

38:43.720 --> 38:47.040
Sooner or later we'll come for her.

38:48.320 --> 38:51.120
If you ever go
near my grandchild again,

38:51.280 --> 38:54.160
I'll kill you with my bare hands.

38:56.080 --> 38:58.920
Make the most of your time together.

39:35.120 --> 39:38.080
This place is beautiful.

39:38.240 --> 39:40.560
You were right about its power.

39:40.720 --> 39:42.120
Come on, honey.
We need to hurry.

39:42.280 --> 39:46.680
If Ysabeau catches us outside the
chateau, she's gonna go nuts.

39:47.880 --> 39:50.040
Okay.

39:51.040 --> 39:52.640
For you.

39:54.120 --> 39:56.960
-Ready?
-Mmm-hmm.

39:57.120 --> 39:59.640
Honey, don't be afraid.
It's okay.

39:59.800 --> 40:03.200
Remember, heartbeat. Yeah?

40:03.360 --> 40:06.400
Yeah.

40:29.000 --> 40:32.360
This space is safe and sacred,
this path is closed to evil.

40:32.520 --> 40:36.440
Shepherd my guiding spirit and bind me
to the person in my thoughts.

40:38.920 --> 40:42.080
This space is safe and sacred,
this path is closed to evil.

40:42.240 --> 40:45.840
Shepherd my guiding spirit and bind
me to the person in my thoughts.

41:05.360 --> 41:09.120
Rebecca...
What are you trying to tell us?

41:09.280 --> 41:11.840
What do you know of the book?

41:12.000 --> 41:13.600
<i>Sarah...</i>

41:13.760 --> 41:15.440
Oh, my God.

41:15.600 --> 41:17.000
<i>Sarah.</i>

41:20.280 --> 41:22.800
Rebecca...

41:22.960 --> 41:24.880
Shit.

41:25.040 --> 41:26.520
Oh...
I'm sorry.

41:26.680 --> 41:30.120
-I couldn't help it.
-It's okay.

41:30.280 --> 41:32.360
-Oh...
-Honey, it's okay.

41:32.520 --> 41:34.240
It's okay.

42:35.560 --> 42:37.720
Is everything all right?

42:39.040 --> 42:40.800
I don't think so.

42:48.640 --> 42:51.560
We are the last of the weavers now.

42:52.480 --> 42:55.880
Her Majesty is keen to hear
why you failed your mission.

42:56.040 --> 42:58.080
<i>The Emperor's odious ambassador</i>

42:58.240 --> 43:02.040
<i>informed me that you preferred</i>
<i>to liberate a book!</i>

43:04.640 --> 43:08.680
With knot of six, this spell I fix.

43:08.840 --> 43:10.400
<i>Matthew.</i>

43:10.560 --> 43:12.360
Are you sure
this is the right place?

43:12.520 --> 43:14.320
I'm certain of it.

43:15.800 --> 43:19.200
<i>So this is the creature</i>
<i>who bewitched my brother.</i>
