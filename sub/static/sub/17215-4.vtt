WEBVTT

00:02.203 --> 00:03.571
Previously on Chance...

00:03.604 --> 00:06.474
(panting)

00:06.507 --> 00:08.176
Stop it, stop it.

00:10.078 --> 00:13.181
-Was it Jackie?
-Yes, I believe it was.

00:13.214 --> 00:15.015
We're gonna be doing some cases
for them pro bono.

00:15.049 --> 00:17.985
You think that will
give you someone to
talk to about Raymond?

00:18.018 --> 00:20.154
He's not omnipotent.
There are limits.

00:20.188 --> 00:22.656
Not until he's dead.
Him or me.

00:22.690 --> 00:24.925
D: How's it coming with
your cop buddy, Blackstone?

00:24.958 --> 00:27.027
BLACKSTONE:
You'd be amazed at how many
coincidences I hear about.

00:27.061 --> 00:29.763
I'm getting to the point
where I don't even
believe in such things.

00:29.797 --> 00:31.699
Next time
we coincide like this,

00:31.732 --> 00:33.267
that's on you.
ELDON: He threatened me.

00:33.301 --> 00:35.536
D: There's ways of handling
a guy like that,

00:35.569 --> 00:38.005
because right now
he's the feeder.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.440
You need to turn
the tables on him.

00:39.473 --> 00:41.375
WOMAN: We are willing
to consider Nicole's

00:41.409 --> 00:44.578
continuing at Havenwood
under strict probation.

00:44.612 --> 00:47.215
It won't be necessary for us
to discuss anything further.

00:47.248 --> 00:49.583
-What are you doing?
-Being the feeder.

00:49.617 --> 00:51.619
You were right.
Shit has hit the fan.

00:51.652 --> 00:55.189
My daughter was attacked. Some
stranger hit her in the face.

00:55.223 --> 00:56.624
This is Blackstone, D.
I know it.

00:56.657 --> 00:58.459
This guy is out to crush me.

00:58.492 --> 01:00.894
D: He's out to show you
he ca crush you.

01:00.928 --> 01:02.430
This is not a game.

01:02.463 --> 01:03.597
Question is not,
is it a game?

01:03.631 --> 01:06.800
Question is,
who sets the rules?

01:09.670 --> 01:12.406
**

01:57.185 --> 02:01.255
Frontotemporal dementia is
a degenerative brain disorder

02:01.289 --> 02:03.691
that affects the nerves
and blood vessels

02:03.724 --> 02:05.826
of the frontal lobe.

02:05.859 --> 02:08.095
Someone with this condition
will experience dramatic changes

02:08.128 --> 02:09.363
in their behavior --

02:09.397 --> 02:12.099
socially inappropriate actions.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.468
Hypersexuality is common.

02:14.502 --> 02:17.838
* More than you ought to be
-Babe, tapping out?

02:17.871 --> 02:19.707
I know you want in on these.

02:23.043 --> 02:27.981
* Lately, I find
you're on my mind *

02:28.015 --> 02:32.019
* More than you ought to be,
yeah *

02:35.689 --> 02:38.926
* Thoughts of you
should bring joy *

02:41.028 --> 02:44.031
* But they only bring misery

02:44.064 --> 02:47.801
Also, emotional indifference
to others' pain or suffering.

02:47.835 --> 02:51.071
ALICE: As in not reacting
to the possibility

02:51.104 --> 02:52.906
of his beloved
wife drowning?

02:52.940 --> 02:54.275
Yes.

02:55.909 --> 02:58.879
And how is FT diagnosed?

02:58.912 --> 03:02.850
Dr. Kushel's SPECT scans
revealed abnormal dark regions

03:02.883 --> 03:04.518
in his prefrontal cortex,

03:04.552 --> 03:07.087
indicating deterioration
in areas

03:07.120 --> 03:09.390
associated with feelings
of shame or empathy,

03:09.423 --> 03:11.158
also impulse control.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.661
We've heard testimony
from friends and family

03:13.694 --> 03:15.596
who described Dr. Kushel
as a sensitive,

03:15.629 --> 03:18.332
self-controlled physician
before he was, um...
(cellphone chimes)

03:18.366 --> 03:20.934
Oh, shit. My jury's back.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.035
-It's all right.
-Sorry.

03:22.069 --> 03:23.437
No, no. Go, go.

03:23.471 --> 03:26.073
Judge Klockner just cleared
her docket, FYI.

03:26.106 --> 03:28.008
We're definitely
gonna be up this time.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.510
But I think
we're in good shape.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.279
Do you feel ready?

03:31.312 --> 03:33.414
As I'll ever be.

03:33.447 --> 03:34.648
Okay.

03:57.938 --> 03:59.307
(elevator dings)

04:11.952 --> 04:14.488
Getting in?

04:14.522 --> 04:16.457
Forgot something.

04:16.490 --> 04:18.526
Sorry.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.862
(siren wails in distance)

04:23.797 --> 04:25.366
Hey.

04:27.535 --> 04:29.737
Listen,
about Blackstone.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.505
Our investigation.
Yep.

04:31.539 --> 04:34.442
Can you hand me that wood glue
on the top shelf?

04:34.475 --> 04:37.277
I...I guess
I don't understand.

04:37.311 --> 04:41.248
It's been --
It's been two days now.

04:41.281 --> 04:44.485
Start right now
if you want.

04:44.518 --> 04:47.488
Well, what I'm saying is
I thought we had started.

04:47.521 --> 04:48.989
I mean, what are we doing?
We're waiting for Blackstone

04:49.022 --> 04:50.458
to make some
other move on us?

04:50.491 --> 04:52.426
He's already shown you
what he can do.

04:52.460 --> 04:54.995
He's not gonna do anything else
till he sees what you do.

04:55.028 --> 04:57.331
Well, what I did was
give you money.

04:57.365 --> 04:59.299
Unless this is you
angling for more.

04:59.333 --> 05:00.868
Not unless you've
changed your mind

05:00.901 --> 05:03.203
about what you want.

05:03.236 --> 05:04.772
5 gets you his computer.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.707
10 gets him a beating,
20 makes him go away.

05:06.740 --> 05:09.209
No, no, no,
that's not -- I --

05:09.242 --> 05:12.179
All I want is something
that I can give the D.A.

05:12.212 --> 05:13.781
You need to
give them something.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.849
Otherwise, it's your word
against Blackstone's.

05:15.883 --> 05:16.984
You don't want that.

05:17.017 --> 05:19.052
All good with the money.

05:19.086 --> 05:20.821
Just a little short
on wheels.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.523
You --
You don't have a car?

05:22.556 --> 05:25.158
License. When I came back
from my last tour,

05:25.192 --> 05:26.660
I just never renewed it.

05:26.694 --> 05:28.462
It seemed best.

05:28.496 --> 05:31.532
So, you can't drive.

05:31.565 --> 05:33.967
Oh, I used to drive
all over the fucking place.

05:34.001 --> 05:37.838
It just didn't go so well.
There were issues.

05:37.871 --> 05:39.206
Let's go find this fucker.

05:39.239 --> 05:43.010
What? Right now?
Okay, uh...

05:43.043 --> 05:45.646
My car is parked
in the alley.

05:45.679 --> 05:48.348
You said Blackstone
broke into your car.

05:48.382 --> 05:50.684
That means he knows
what it looks like.

05:50.718 --> 05:54.688
We'll have to fix that.
Let's go rent something.

05:54.722 --> 05:56.490
Your butter
has to be salted,

05:56.524 --> 05:58.191
and it has to be
real butter.

05:58.225 --> 06:00.661
Cheese can be whatever
kind of cheese people like.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.430
I prefer good
American cheese.

06:02.463 --> 06:06.434
Then you put some olive oil
in a pan, and then your butter.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.268
The oil keeps the butter
from burning too quickly.

06:08.301 --> 06:10.170
Put your bread
and cheese together,

06:10.203 --> 06:11.905
salt and pepper
between the cheese.

06:11.939 --> 06:14.374
Then throw it in the pan
on top of the hot oil.

06:14.408 --> 06:16.677
Now, the key here
is temperature control.

06:16.710 --> 06:19.246
You want to crisp the bread
without melting out the cheese.

06:19.279 --> 06:20.881
Now you take it off.

06:20.914 --> 06:23.050
Use a paper towel
to wipe up the excess oil

06:23.083 --> 06:24.885
and do the same thing
on the other side.

06:24.918 --> 06:27.788
It will be crispy
but fluffy.

06:27.821 --> 06:30.023
The perfect grilled
cheese sandwich.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.959
-Are we done here?
-Why?

06:31.992 --> 06:33.794
It's still light out.

06:33.827 --> 06:38.198
I don't know. It just
feels weird sitting outside.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.800
I feel overmatched.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.869
You're looking
at the smoke, brother.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.437
The trappings of power.

06:43.471 --> 06:45.606
Blackstone rests on that.

06:45.639 --> 06:47.875
We call it
domain specificity.

06:47.908 --> 06:50.043
Within a certain domain,
he's powerful.

06:50.077 --> 06:52.713
Put yourself in his
crosshairs in his domain,

06:52.746 --> 06:53.947
he can use that power.

06:53.981 --> 06:55.415
To my point.

06:55.449 --> 06:56.917
I'm feeling like
I'm in the crosshairs.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.786
I'm feeling a little
more rabbit-like

06:58.819 --> 07:00.087
than I would prefer.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.789
But here's the thing
about a dirty cop.

07:01.822 --> 07:05.726
He's already stepping
outside his domain.

07:05.759 --> 07:06.960
That's a big chink
in his armor.

07:06.994 --> 07:08.462
I want to take down
a guy like that,

07:08.496 --> 07:10.831
I'm going right there --
Catch him where he lives.

07:10.864 --> 07:13.634
What's he gonna do?
(chuckling) Call a cop?

07:13.667 --> 07:15.969
You're looking at this
like a receiver.

07:16.003 --> 07:18.338
We're gonna feed
this fucker.

07:21.809 --> 07:24.177
There he is.
That's him.

07:26.046 --> 07:27.615
You see him?
-Yeah.

07:27.648 --> 07:31.184
Shoulders loose,
hands by his waistband.

07:31.218 --> 07:32.653
What does that mean?

07:32.686 --> 07:34.588
Means he's ready
to fight.

07:34.622 --> 07:36.323
Also to pull a weapon.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.960
Operator I worked
with in Kandahar

07:39.993 --> 07:43.864
used to say --
feet never killed anyone.

07:49.336 --> 07:50.538
Audi, right?

07:50.571 --> 07:52.172
Yeah.

07:52.205 --> 07:56.076
Good enough detective he ranks
a prime parking spot.

08:02.750 --> 08:05.052
Here we go.

08:05.085 --> 08:07.187
Steady, man.
It's all good.

08:07.220 --> 08:10.658
Far back as we can
without losing sight.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.459
And if we do lose sight...

08:12.492 --> 08:14.995
Who gives a shit?

08:15.028 --> 08:19.232
Yep. Loose to lose --
that's the technique.

08:19.266 --> 08:22.536
Follow as far as we can
without getting burned.

08:22.570 --> 08:23.704
And that's the rule --

08:23.737 --> 08:25.739
never get burned.

08:25.773 --> 08:28.542
If we lose him,
come back the next day,

08:28.576 --> 08:30.510
pick him up right
where were we lost him.

08:30.544 --> 08:33.346
Then we're back to our map,
and we're marking our route.

08:33.380 --> 08:35.583
Over time, we know
where he lives

08:35.616 --> 08:38.151
and where he goes,
and we've got a formula,

08:38.185 --> 08:39.853
and you're sticking to it.

08:39.887 --> 08:42.122
You're making
a grilled cheese sandwich.

08:44.224 --> 08:47.527
A faster fucking car
wouldn't hurt.

08:49.296 --> 08:51.098
Just sayin'.

08:56.637 --> 08:58.105
Same time tomorrow, Doc?

08:58.138 --> 08:59.907
What? Uh, no, I can't.

08:59.940 --> 09:02.576
I-I, you know --
I do have a practice.

09:02.610 --> 09:03.577
What time you close?

09:03.611 --> 09:05.212
What time do we close?

09:05.245 --> 09:06.747
We close at 6:00.

09:06.780 --> 09:07.948
I don't see patients
after 4:00.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.116
Perfect.

09:09.149 --> 09:10.283
Be here at 4:30.

09:10.317 --> 09:13.086
Okay.

09:13.120 --> 09:16.423
I got to say, this --
this is all so weird, you know?

09:16.456 --> 09:18.926
I mean, I'm a medical
professional,

09:18.959 --> 09:21.595
not some Raymond Chandler
character.

09:21.629 --> 09:23.496
You want to help
this Jaclyn or not?

09:25.265 --> 09:27.701
-What?
-Your lady.

09:27.735 --> 09:29.536
She's not my lady.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.038
You said you were trying
to help someone,

09:31.071 --> 09:33.106
and the last person
who tried got murdered.

09:33.140 --> 09:35.308
She's not your lady?
What is she?

09:35.342 --> 09:37.577
(sighs)
I consulted on her case.

09:37.611 --> 09:39.813
I made a referral.
How do you know her name?

09:39.847 --> 09:41.314
You said you went
to a Chinese restaurant

09:41.348 --> 09:42.582
to meet with Jaclyn

09:42.616 --> 09:43.951
when Blackstone
threatened you.

09:43.984 --> 09:46.253
I remember things
people say.

09:47.755 --> 09:49.657
He...terrorizes her.

09:49.690 --> 09:51.058
You know?

09:51.091 --> 09:53.627
He -- He --
He attacked her so violently

09:53.661 --> 09:56.096
he triggered
a dissociative state.

09:56.129 --> 09:58.666
Second personality.

09:58.699 --> 09:59.933
I've met her -- Jackie.

09:59.967 --> 10:01.835
She your lady?

10:01.869 --> 10:03.671
N-- Neither --

10:03.704 --> 10:04.938
4:30, Doc.

10:04.972 --> 10:06.339
On time is late.

10:33.701 --> 10:36.704
(line ringing)

10:36.737 --> 10:39.539
JACLYN: Leave a message.
(beep)

10:39.572 --> 10:42.209
Hi, it's Eldon.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.644
Uh, I just thought
I'd check in,

10:44.678 --> 10:46.714
see how things were
going with Suzanne.

10:46.747 --> 10:49.817
I hope it's going well.
I'm sure it is.

10:49.850 --> 10:54.321
But, uh, I was, uh --
I was thinking about you

10:54.354 --> 10:56.489
and, uh, wondering about...

10:56.523 --> 10:58.692
everything.

10:59.727 --> 11:06.066
Um, the way you left
my apartment and, uh...

11:06.099 --> 11:07.901
Anyway, any time you --

11:07.935 --> 11:09.837
you want to call me back,
I'll be around.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.504
Uh...

11:11.538 --> 11:14.074
Oh, by the way,
probably best not to mention

11:14.107 --> 11:15.375
to Suzanne that I called.

11:15.408 --> 11:17.044
Okay, thanks.

11:26.453 --> 11:28.756
(cellphone rings)

11:36.596 --> 11:40.200
Yeah, I'm, uh, just on my way
to the office, Christina --

11:43.904 --> 11:45.839
Why?
(door slams)

11:45.873 --> 11:49.376
What the hell would he build
a workout space down there for?

11:49.409 --> 11:50.577
So he could train
more clients,

11:50.610 --> 11:51.879
so he could contribute.

11:51.912 --> 11:54.347
He knocked out two
support pillars.

11:54.381 --> 11:55.715
He had to hang a heavy bag,

11:55.749 --> 11:56.950
and then there was
all the other equipment.

11:56.984 --> 11:58.585
That was
a weight-bearing wall.

11:58.618 --> 12:02.289
Ugh. The foundation
is damaged now. Am I wrong?

12:02.322 --> 12:03.924
Andrea said the buyer
bought a structural engineer

12:03.957 --> 12:06.226
who says the house
is now potentially unsafe.

12:06.259 --> 12:08.195
I know this.
He fucked up, okay?

12:08.228 --> 12:09.797
And he's very regretful
about it, and so am I.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.464
Does Neil understand

12:11.498 --> 12:13.801
what's involved financially here
if we can't sell that house?

12:13.834 --> 12:16.603
Jesus, we've got
unpaid attorney's fees.

12:16.636 --> 12:17.938
We got taxes,
got a double mortgage.

12:17.971 --> 12:19.807
-Yes, he understands.
-Well, do you?

12:19.840 --> 12:22.409
You know, there's at least
a couple of people

12:22.442 --> 12:24.577
living in tents
on Division Street right now

12:24.611 --> 12:25.779
who thought it could
never happen to them.

12:29.149 --> 12:30.317
Man.

12:30.350 --> 12:31.718
You know what, honey?

12:31.751 --> 12:32.953
I've got some time.

12:32.986 --> 12:34.955
I'd like to take you out
for a while,

12:34.988 --> 12:35.989
show you something, okay?

12:36.023 --> 12:37.157
-Really, now?
-Why not?

12:37.190 --> 12:38.491
It's not like
she's got school.

12:38.525 --> 12:41.561
-Yeah.
-Eldon, man, I'm really sorry.

12:41.594 --> 12:44.664
Okay, seriously,
I-I didn't mean to...

12:44.697 --> 12:46.333
What can I do?

12:46.366 --> 12:48.668
You can make it right.
That's what.

12:48.701 --> 12:50.237
You want to make it
right, Neil?

12:50.270 --> 12:52.072
Yeah.

12:52.105 --> 12:55.242
Yeah, no, I'll -- I'll put it
all back the way it was.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.276
All of it.

12:56.309 --> 12:58.611
I will.

12:58.645 --> 13:00.480
Okay, well,
you can tell Andrea

13:00.513 --> 13:02.282
to tell people that the price
is the price as is.

13:02.315 --> 13:03.683
They can take it
or leave it.

13:03.716 --> 13:06.319
I'll get Nic back by lunch.

13:06.353 --> 13:09.122
Divorce has had a pretty
magical effect on you, huh?

13:09.156 --> 13:12.159
You're just making big decisions
all over the place now.

13:12.192 --> 13:14.494
Full of fuck-you's
for the world.

13:14.527 --> 13:16.563
Yeah, that's me.

13:18.531 --> 13:21.869
And Berkeley High is
less than a mile that way.

13:21.902 --> 13:24.704
Uh, that way.

13:24.737 --> 13:27.540
Hey, how bad did Neil
fuck up the house?

13:27.574 --> 13:29.943
It's not your problem,
sweetie.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.544
It is if it falls down.

13:31.578 --> 13:33.947
It won't.

13:33.981 --> 13:35.949
What about earthquakes?

13:35.983 --> 13:38.651
All he did was he just made it
a little harder to sell.

13:38.685 --> 13:39.887
That's it.

13:42.089 --> 13:43.456
Here we are.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.725
Whoa.
This is the place?

13:45.758 --> 13:47.861
-What you think?
-It's actually a possibility?

13:47.895 --> 13:49.629
Averages out at less
than I pay in the city.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.664
How'd you even find it?

13:51.698 --> 13:54.234
Well, gee, I used this thing
called the interweb.

13:54.267 --> 13:55.869
(chuckles)

13:55.903 --> 13:57.670
They want an answer
by Friday.

13:57.704 --> 13:59.907
There's a group of engineering
grad students

13:59.940 --> 14:02.910
who've got great credit,
and they're in the offing.

14:02.943 --> 14:05.045
Want to check out the unit?

14:05.078 --> 14:07.147
Sure.
But I already like it.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.549
Okay, but, you know,
you might not like the --

14:09.582 --> 14:11.318
the sauna
and the roof garden.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.921
-Are you kidding?
-Only about it having those.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.555
Aw!

14:15.588 --> 14:18.225
Man walks down
the middle of road.

14:18.258 --> 14:21.094
There are no lights,
no moon.

14:21.128 --> 14:23.897
He's dressed all in black.

14:23.931 --> 14:25.999
Car drives down
the same road.

14:26.033 --> 14:28.902
The car has no lights
but swerves,

14:28.936 --> 14:31.004
missing the man
at the last second.

14:31.038 --> 14:32.105
How does this happen?

14:32.139 --> 14:33.673
I have no idea.

14:33.706 --> 14:36.276
You want a hint?

14:36.309 --> 14:38.511
Nope, I give up.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.847
It's daylight, professor.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.216
Here we go.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.784
What do you think?

14:44.817 --> 14:47.220
Liquor store,
check-cashing joint,

14:47.254 --> 14:49.756
or the massage parlor?

14:49.789 --> 14:51.724
Out of his domain.

14:51.758 --> 14:52.759
(camera shutter clicks)

14:52.792 --> 14:54.127
It's -- It's a brothel, right?

14:54.161 --> 14:58.565
Happy Hands it is.
See how long he stays.

14:58.598 --> 15:00.100
You hungry?

15:01.634 --> 15:03.236
Uh, no.

15:03.270 --> 15:04.972
(car door opens)
I'll be right back.

15:05.005 --> 15:06.206
(car door closes)

15:06.239 --> 15:08.508
(siren wails in distance)

15:18.151 --> 15:21.488
Excuse me, sir, but could you
spare some change, please?

15:21.521 --> 15:24.491
Anything -- baby's hungry.

15:24.524 --> 15:26.593
Uh...Yeah, sure.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.161
Hold on a second.

15:29.296 --> 15:30.363
Hey.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.569
Get the fuck out of here.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.205
Fuck you.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.585
What I'm feeling --

15:52.619 --> 15:54.321
you're not much
into riddles.

15:56.456 --> 15:59.526
Maybe it's 'cause
I'm not that good at them.

15:59.559 --> 16:01.161
Also, 'cause much
of the time,

16:01.194 --> 16:03.030
feels to me like
someone's got an answer

16:03.063 --> 16:04.097
and wants to show you
how smart they are.

16:04.131 --> 16:05.598
(chuckles)

16:05.632 --> 16:08.535
I don't give a fuck
about answers.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.870
What I want to know is,
what is the formula

16:10.903 --> 16:12.605
that's being used
to trick me?

16:12.639 --> 16:16.009
If I can recognize the formula,
then I can sidestep the trap.

16:16.043 --> 16:18.445
The one with the guy
walking down the road --

16:18.478 --> 16:20.613
that's using extraneous
detail to mask

16:20.647 --> 16:22.115
what's not being said.

16:22.149 --> 16:23.316
There he is.

16:26.053 --> 16:27.520
What do we do?
We stay with him?

16:27.554 --> 16:29.656
Fucker was in there
for two hours.

16:29.689 --> 16:32.992
What we need to know now
is how often.

16:33.026 --> 16:37.197
Once a week?
Same day, same time?

16:37.230 --> 16:40.333
Rule number one --
never get burned.

16:40.367 --> 16:43.036
Rule number two --
never press your luck.

16:45.238 --> 16:46.506
(engine starts)

16:46.539 --> 16:48.141
You're on an island
with two tribes.

16:48.175 --> 16:49.509
Oh, Jesus.

16:50.777 --> 16:54.381
JUDGE: Does the prosecution have
any questions for the witness?

16:54.414 --> 16:59.052
Does frontotemporal dementia
diminish intellectual capacity,

16:59.086 --> 17:01.354
or moral clarity?

17:01.388 --> 17:03.490
No, it does not.

17:03.523 --> 17:06.159
A disorder that doesn't
remove the concept of law

17:06.193 --> 17:09.028
but encourages
or allows a person to behave

17:09.062 --> 17:10.730
badly seems convenient,
doesn't it?

17:10.763 --> 17:12.265
Editorializing phrased
as question, Your Honor.

17:12.299 --> 17:13.333
Withdrawn.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.034
Dr. Chance, does a person

17:15.068 --> 17:16.569
with frontotemporal
dementia know

17:16.603 --> 17:18.671
the difference
between right and wrong?

17:18.705 --> 17:19.906
They certainly can.

17:19.939 --> 17:23.910
Does Dr. Kushel,
in your opinion?

17:24.777 --> 17:26.613
Yes, I believe he does.

17:29.582 --> 17:33.253
Although, to be clear,
you can know the difference

17:33.286 --> 17:35.255
between right and wrong
intellectually,

17:35.288 --> 17:36.856
but still be unable
to stop yourself

17:36.889 --> 17:38.758
from doing wrong.

17:43.263 --> 17:46.233
CHANCE: Kushel sprung from
med school with prescription pad

17:46.266 --> 17:49.636
and a broad mantra --
do no harm.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.271
Easier said than done.

17:51.304 --> 17:53.140
Well, he does it.

17:53.173 --> 17:55.442
He got married, kids, house.

17:55.475 --> 17:58.978
He's caring, reliable
(breathes deeply)

17:59.011 --> 18:01.047
consistent.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.716
Until suddenly, he stops
obeying traffic lights,

18:03.750 --> 18:06.319
the stop signs,
starts shoplifting

18:06.353 --> 18:07.787
and taking off
his shirt in public.

18:07.820 --> 18:11.124
From there he goes
to trading Oxy scripts

18:11.158 --> 18:14.494
for oral sex like it's the most
natural thing in the world.

18:14.527 --> 18:16.263
What you call
a mid-life crisis.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.231
Oh, that's the question.

18:18.265 --> 18:21.634
Where does personality end
and neurological damage begin?

18:23.203 --> 18:24.937
This guy's case stemmed

18:24.971 --> 18:27.140
from visible
neurological damage.

18:27.174 --> 18:29.976
The point is
that the very organ

18:30.009 --> 18:34.414
that he had trained to save
is betraying him.

18:34.447 --> 18:37.317
Might land him in jail.

18:37.350 --> 18:40.119
You want to have some food
with your salt?

18:40.153 --> 18:41.254
It's a cleansing agent.

18:41.288 --> 18:43.122
When it's salted?

18:43.156 --> 18:45.024
What they clean cast-iron
skillets with,

18:45.057 --> 18:46.626
not soap and water.

18:46.659 --> 18:49.662
They scour it with
a big fistful of salt.

18:49.696 --> 18:53.633
You think your blood pressure
is a cast-iron skillet?

18:53.666 --> 18:56.236
'Cause I can assure you
it's not.

18:59.706 --> 19:01.708
He likes dogs.

19:01.741 --> 19:03.810
Yeah. So did Hitler.

19:08.915 --> 19:11.017
This is interesting.

19:24.197 --> 19:26.666
Who are they?

19:26.699 --> 19:28.000
Fuck if I know.

19:50.857 --> 19:54.093
He gave the dog
to the girl.

19:54.126 --> 19:55.728
Do we stay with him?

19:57.564 --> 19:59.065
D?
No.

19:59.098 --> 20:01.200
Uh, too risky
to follow on foot.

20:01.234 --> 20:03.069
Let's call it a day.

20:22.322 --> 20:25.392
(keys clatter)

20:26.493 --> 20:28.328
(sniffs)

20:38.638 --> 20:40.473
(cellphone rings)

20:40.507 --> 20:41.741
(sets down bottle)

20:46.145 --> 20:49.148
Hey, honey.
-Did you get the apartment?

20:49.181 --> 20:50.917
-The...
-Did you call?

20:50.950 --> 20:52.485
What did they say?

20:55.154 --> 20:56.589
Yeah, uh, I did.

20:56.623 --> 20:59.158
I called, and...

20:59.191 --> 21:02.128
they gave it
to the grad students.

21:02.161 --> 21:03.730
I thought you were
before them.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.765
Yeah, so did I.
I-I don't know.

21:05.798 --> 21:07.634
The building manager
must have --

21:07.667 --> 21:09.469
must have made a mistake.

21:09.502 --> 21:10.903
I'm sorry.

21:10.937 --> 21:12.905
(downcast voice)
Okay. Love you.

21:12.939 --> 21:13.940
Hey --

21:13.973 --> 21:15.608
(line clicks)

21:24.050 --> 21:25.452
We've heard testimony
from friends and family

21:25.485 --> 21:28.588
who say Dr. Kushel
was an empathetic

21:28.621 --> 21:31.924
and self-controlled physician
before he was diagnosed.

21:31.958 --> 21:33.660
That doesn't surprise me.

21:33.693 --> 21:35.695
Then could Dr. Kushel,
in your opinion,

21:35.728 --> 21:38.998
have exercised willpower
to stop himself

21:39.031 --> 21:41.368
from writing his wife
or anyone else

21:41.401 --> 21:43.570
prescriptions for narcotics
that they didn't need?

21:50.242 --> 21:52.612
Uh...I'm sorry.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.847
Wha-- the, uh...
-Could he -- Could Dr. Kushel

21:54.881 --> 21:56.983
have stopped himself
from writing prescriptions?

21:57.016 --> 22:00.286
Uh, in my opinion, no.

22:00.319 --> 22:01.488
And why is that?

22:01.521 --> 22:03.155
Frontotemporal dementia

22:03.189 --> 22:04.991
robbed him
of that capacity.

22:05.024 --> 22:07.960
He could no more force himself
to do the right thing than a man

22:07.994 --> 22:10.963
with a severed spinal column
could force himself to walk.

22:10.997 --> 22:13.366
And does Dr. Kushel know
what's wrong with him?

22:13.400 --> 22:14.734
In my view, he --

22:14.767 --> 22:17.236
Fucking right I do.
I'm a Goddamn doctor.

22:17.269 --> 22:19.539
Dr. Kushel, I'm not going
to warn you again.

22:23.175 --> 22:26.513
This is Officer Kirk, SFPD.

22:26.546 --> 22:30.650
Building security called us
about Mr. Taylor's car.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.685
Well, it looks like
somebody broke into it.

22:32.719 --> 22:34.086
Big mess.

22:34.120 --> 22:37.189
He available to come down
to level 2?

22:37.223 --> 22:41.594
No, has to be him in person.
He needs to sign the report.

22:41.628 --> 22:43.896
Thanks.

22:43.930 --> 22:46.365
What kind of
errand is this?

22:46.399 --> 22:49.268
The kind where you go
someplace and surprise a guy.

23:01.748 --> 23:03.015
Hey, Frank.

23:03.049 --> 23:05.184
You suck at your job.

23:05.217 --> 23:06.519
I found you, didn't I?

23:06.553 --> 23:09.188
Yeah, but how long
did it take you?

23:09.221 --> 23:10.222
(grunts)

23:10.256 --> 23:11.323
Open your trunk.

23:12.425 --> 23:15.094
This can go one
of two ways, Frank.

23:15.127 --> 23:16.829
If I was you, I'd go
with the first one.

23:18.097 --> 23:19.699
Why are you looking at him?
Don't look at him.

23:19.732 --> 23:20.800
Look at me.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.072
Good.

23:26.105 --> 23:27.574
Put your hands on the bumper
there, both hands.

23:27.607 --> 23:28.808
What?

23:28.841 --> 23:29.942
Did you really not hear me?

23:29.976 --> 23:31.210
Or are you trying
to buy time?

23:31.243 --> 23:32.579
Wait, listen.
Just listen to me.

23:32.612 --> 23:33.680
Shut up.

23:45.758 --> 23:49.462
Looking pretty fucking
scared there, Frank.

23:51.363 --> 23:53.933
You ever want
to find me again,

23:53.966 --> 23:55.968
this'll help you remember what
you looked like when you did.

23:56.002 --> 23:57.604
You got that?

23:59.271 --> 24:00.540
(grunts)

24:07.480 --> 24:09.782
(crying softly)

24:12.652 --> 24:14.721
(golf club clatters)

24:18.825 --> 24:21.027
What the fuck was that?

24:21.060 --> 24:22.662
Picture connects the fear
and the pain,

24:22.695 --> 24:24.330
crushes the spirit.

24:24.363 --> 24:27.333
Plus, we got a watch.
-Not an answer.

24:27.366 --> 24:29.268
Whatever it was,
I don't want to be a party

24:29.301 --> 24:31.638
to anything like
that ever again.

24:31.671 --> 24:33.606
You are a party to it,
Doc.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.608
What that asshole was doing
was gonna interfere

24:35.642 --> 24:38.344
with what you
and I are doing here now.

24:38.377 --> 24:40.580
It already has.
We're late.

24:43.583 --> 24:45.151
That guy was in the bar.

24:45.184 --> 24:47.554
Yes, he was.
Good get.

24:47.587 --> 24:49.055
So, why?!

24:50.757 --> 24:53.793
Scumbag's not a cop, okay?
He's private.

24:53.826 --> 24:55.862
It was a private matter.

24:55.895 --> 24:57.463
But you did good,
by the way.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.131
He looked at you.

24:59.165 --> 25:01.167
I thought you were gonna say
something, show weakness,

25:01.200 --> 25:02.669
but you didn't.

25:02.702 --> 25:05.504
You just gave him
a fucking hard-ass stare.

25:05.538 --> 25:07.974
Were you aware of that?

25:08.007 --> 25:09.576
I was not.

25:09.609 --> 25:12.745
He thinks we're a damn team.
Killers on the road.

25:12.779 --> 25:15.815
You see his fucking face
in that picture?

25:15.848 --> 25:18.117
(chortles)

25:19.518 --> 25:23.122
Let's go see what other nuggets
we can chisel out of this day.

25:24.256 --> 25:26.693
(men shouting indistinctly)
(motor revs in distance)

25:39.038 --> 25:41.941
Routine really is like
having a target on your back.

25:41.974 --> 25:43.442
There you go.

25:43.475 --> 25:44.410
(camera shutter clicks)

25:44.443 --> 25:45.612
Another cop?

25:45.645 --> 25:48.948
Maybe they come
for the wings.

25:54.954 --> 25:57.389
What the fuck?

26:01.160 --> 26:04.764
Oh, Christ.

26:04.797 --> 26:08.334
He's just a cop
being a cop.

26:10.302 --> 26:13.305
(groans)

26:13.339 --> 26:15.708
This is what we've been watching
this whole fucking time?

26:15.742 --> 26:18.377
Him setting up this bust?

26:18.410 --> 26:19.979
Doing the job doesn't
change who he is.

26:20.012 --> 26:22.915
(camera shutter clicking)

26:25.017 --> 26:29.088
Anyway, massage parlor
hand jobs are vice.

26:29.121 --> 26:31.257
He's homicide.

26:31.290 --> 26:33.125
Why is he wasting
his time on something

26:33.159 --> 26:34.927
that isn't even
his department?

26:34.961 --> 26:37.997
Your not knowing the reason
doesn't mean there isn't one.

26:38.030 --> 26:40.933
I know there is one.
That's my point.

26:40.967 --> 26:43.102
Blackstone is the guy
walking down the road --

26:43.135 --> 26:45.738
using extraneous details
to mask what is not --

26:45.772 --> 26:49.776
Oh, Christ on a bike,
stop it with the riddles!

26:51.610 --> 26:56.983
He's -- He's a cop, D.
He's doing cop stuff.

26:57.016 --> 26:58.250
We're two assholes
sitting in car

26:58.284 --> 26:59.852
that smells of onion rings.

26:59.886 --> 27:01.087
Have it your way, Doc.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.855
What other way
is there to have it?

27:02.889 --> 27:04.023
We've been sitting here --

27:04.056 --> 27:05.257
how long have we been
sitting here?

27:05.291 --> 27:06.993
For this?
I'm sorry.

27:07.026 --> 27:09.095
I forgot the riddles
and the fine dining.

27:09.128 --> 27:11.764
-Your lady --
-She's not my --

27:11.798 --> 27:13.332
Jaclyn never
said her husband

27:13.365 --> 27:15.802
didn't get his day job
done, right?
(siren wails)

27:15.835 --> 27:17.804
She said he's dirty.

27:17.837 --> 27:20.272
The point is
we get to know him,

27:20.306 --> 27:22.474
so we're there when
he trips over his dick.

27:22.508 --> 27:24.811
Maybe there is
no fucking point.

27:28.681 --> 27:31.583
Maybe I want my money back
'cause this is all bullshit.

27:33.753 --> 27:36.889
(camera shutter clicks)

27:36.923 --> 27:39.358
How about we change it up?

27:39.391 --> 27:42.161
Day after tomorrow's Saturday.
We know where he lives.

27:42.194 --> 27:45.364
How about we see
what he does on his day off?

27:45.397 --> 27:48.534
We get no joy out of that,
we can talk about a refund.

27:50.036 --> 27:53.405
This -- This...

27:53.439 --> 27:54.807
Jesus.

27:54.841 --> 27:57.009
You want a soda?

27:58.110 --> 27:59.478
Or a cone?

27:59.511 --> 28:01.013
I think they got
ice cream in there.

28:02.114 --> 28:03.582
No, thank you.

28:05.351 --> 28:07.086
I'll get you some water.

28:07.119 --> 28:10.089
(car door opens)

28:10.122 --> 28:11.390
(cellphone rings)

28:16.028 --> 28:18.230
Suzanne.

28:18.264 --> 28:21.834
Jesus, El, how much
have you had?

28:21.868 --> 28:24.236
It is the shank of the evening,
as they say.

28:24.270 --> 28:26.338
What's up?

28:26.372 --> 28:28.274
There's been, um,
an incident with Jaclyn.

28:28.307 --> 28:29.942
I wanted to be sure
before I told you.

28:29.976 --> 28:32.912
She -- She took some money
from her student's house.

28:32.945 --> 28:34.046
Stole it.
-What?

28:34.080 --> 28:35.748
When?
-Yesterday.

28:36.949 --> 28:39.752
And you're --
you're sure about this?

28:39.786 --> 28:42.054
Her mother's
my friend, remember?

28:42.088 --> 28:44.623
Father's a developer,
keeps a lot of cash around,

28:44.656 --> 28:46.558
$2,000 of which
is now gone, apparently.

28:46.592 --> 28:48.060
Christ.

28:48.094 --> 28:50.596
They're not pressing charges,
thank God.

28:50.629 --> 28:53.365
They just want her gone.

28:53.399 --> 28:54.600
Did you talk to Jaclyn?

28:54.633 --> 28:56.102
What did she say?
-She denies it.

28:56.135 --> 28:58.370
But then she denies
her memory

28:58.404 --> 29:01.140
and the existence of time
and everything else.

29:01.173 --> 29:05.077
And besides, she's really
the only one it could have been.

29:05.111 --> 29:06.578
It could have been Jackie.

29:06.612 --> 29:08.280
I mean, she could --
she could --

29:08.314 --> 29:12.584
Whatever it is,
I don't know what to do now.

29:12.618 --> 29:13.953
You have another plan?

29:16.422 --> 29:20.259
No. I-I don't.

29:42.114 --> 29:45.751
(line ringing)

29:45.784 --> 29:48.220
JACLYN: Leave a message.
(beep)

29:52.024 --> 29:53.960
(cellphone clatters)

30:04.536 --> 30:05.637
Hey.

30:08.240 --> 30:09.708
Where's, uh...

30:09.741 --> 30:12.544
Hong -- he canceled.
His wife called.

30:12.578 --> 30:17.549
He's under a 72-hour
involuntary hold at SF General.

30:17.583 --> 30:19.018
Okay.

30:19.051 --> 30:23.489
Uh, that guy,
the mad doctor -- Kushel --

30:23.522 --> 30:25.557
his verdict came in guilty.

30:25.591 --> 30:30.562
Yeah, well, I guess
that's not really a surprise.

30:30.596 --> 30:32.398
He's asking to see you.

30:32.431 --> 30:35.868
Who? Kushel? Why?

30:35.902 --> 30:37.469
I don't know.

30:37.503 --> 30:40.039
His attorney reached out.

30:40.072 --> 30:43.242
They've got him at County
waiting transfer to Vacaville,

30:43.275 --> 30:44.977
and he wants you to visit.

30:45.011 --> 30:47.579
Oh, man. I'll have
to think about that.

30:47.613 --> 30:50.549
Also, my maternity leave.

30:50.582 --> 30:53.219
Yeah, right.
Yes, that's starting...

30:53.252 --> 30:55.587
-Tomorrow.
-No.

30:55.621 --> 30:57.323
Yeah, it starts tomorrow.

30:57.356 --> 30:59.391
No, no, I thought it was
gonna be next month.

30:59.425 --> 31:02.794
It was gonna be,
and...now it's not.

31:04.196 --> 31:06.598
What do you mean?
What happened?

31:06.632 --> 31:09.268
Is there something
wrong with the baby?

31:09.301 --> 31:12.438
Well, then, what changed?

31:12.471 --> 31:13.539
You did.

31:13.572 --> 31:15.407
Yeah.

31:15.441 --> 31:17.109
Well, you know, I've had
a lot on my plate.

31:17.143 --> 31:19.878
Yeah, it's not just lately.

31:19.912 --> 31:22.448
You haven't been yourself
for a long time.

31:22.481 --> 31:24.783
Although, these days,
you're just so jumpy

31:24.816 --> 31:28.020
and shady and...
I don't know.

31:28.054 --> 31:31.557
But I keep waiting for you
to react or something

31:31.590 --> 31:33.725
or come back to your normal self
or at least show

31:33.759 --> 31:36.262
that you know that you've
changed, but you never do.

31:36.295 --> 31:38.397
And I don't know --
it's your life.

31:38.430 --> 31:41.633
And I just -- I really --

31:41.667 --> 31:44.703
I really like
working here and now.

31:44.736 --> 31:47.873
I don't want to do
shady right now.

31:47.906 --> 31:51.944
Anyway, so, I'm just
gonna not have ankles

31:51.978 --> 31:53.212
and try not
to drink grape soda

31:53.245 --> 31:56.748
at home on the couch
instead of here.

31:56.782 --> 31:59.551
I do know.
And I'm gonna fix it.

31:59.585 --> 32:00.953
Please don't leave.

32:00.987 --> 32:03.122
I was leaving
in a month anyway.

32:03.155 --> 32:04.991
I'll make sure there's
a temp in the morning.

32:11.530 --> 32:15.467
D: Never would've figured you
for a motorcycle guy.

32:15.501 --> 32:19.405
ELDON: That was 30 years ago,
give or take.

32:19.438 --> 32:21.940
I wasn't really.
Broke my femur.

32:21.974 --> 32:26.145
Silver lining was I got to spend
a year abroad in Oxford.

32:26.178 --> 32:27.679
What'd you do there?

32:27.713 --> 32:30.082
Studied French
and German literature.

32:30.116 --> 32:31.517
Not medicine?

32:31.550 --> 32:34.320
It was medicine I was
trying to get away from.

32:34.353 --> 32:35.954
Among other things.

32:35.988 --> 32:37.623
Oh, what do we have here?

32:37.656 --> 32:39.625
(camera shutter clicking)

32:43.829 --> 32:46.165
You okay?

32:46.198 --> 32:48.967
Wait. Is that Jaclyn?

32:50.902 --> 32:52.038
Yes.

32:52.071 --> 32:53.205
Mm.

32:53.239 --> 32:55.041
I guess I get it now.

32:55.074 --> 32:57.276
You never said
what she looked like.

32:57.309 --> 32:59.011
(camera shutter clicking)

32:59.045 --> 33:02.281
But I thought you said
she was leaving him, though.

33:02.314 --> 33:04.883
Oh, wait, is this the other one?
Which one is this?

33:04.916 --> 33:06.952
Is this Jackie?

33:06.985 --> 33:08.387
I don't know who that is.

33:18.897 --> 33:20.232
You okay?

33:23.269 --> 33:24.536
Yeah.

33:24.570 --> 33:26.972
-You sure?
-Yeah.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.374
Do you know
what's going on?

33:28.407 --> 33:29.675
What's the deal with them?

33:31.710 --> 33:34.580
No, I...I don't know.

33:35.714 --> 33:37.216
(sighs)

33:37.249 --> 33:40.018
All right, listen.
Sit tight.

33:40.052 --> 33:42.888
I'm gonna get you some water.

33:44.223 --> 33:46.092
(car door closes)

33:49.761 --> 33:51.263
(car beeps)

34:09.915 --> 34:13.252
(indistinct conversation)

34:48.754 --> 34:50.156
Did he see you?

34:55.294 --> 34:57.296
Did he?

34:57.329 --> 34:59.265
I don't know.
I don't think so.

35:02.434 --> 35:04.570
Why'd you go in there?

35:04.603 --> 35:06.305
Do you even know?

35:06.338 --> 35:09.575
A man who cannot cover
nor restrain his emotions

35:09.608 --> 35:11.477
is no longer
his own master.

35:11.510 --> 35:13.111
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah.

35:13.145 --> 35:14.980
Don't be stupid.

35:15.013 --> 35:16.782
You're not stupid.

35:19.951 --> 35:24.089
You familiar with the concept
of the frozen lake?

35:24.122 --> 35:25.657
No, I'm not.

35:25.691 --> 35:28.827
Learned it
when I was in the Teams.

35:28.860 --> 35:31.297
Something you want so badly

35:31.330 --> 35:35.967
you'll go out to the center
of a frozen lake to reach it.

35:36.001 --> 35:37.769
Where the ice is thinnest.

35:37.803 --> 35:40.972
But you won't see that.

35:41.006 --> 35:43.742
Everyone else will,
just not you.

35:46.912 --> 35:48.547
I'm rolling with my guys.

35:48.580 --> 35:51.683
Someone says to me,
"You're on your frozen lake."

35:53.519 --> 35:55.721
I stop and take time
right then

35:55.754 --> 35:57.989
because he sees
something I can't.

35:58.023 --> 36:00.692
And I need to hear that.

36:00.726 --> 36:03.995
Whatever it is I'm doing,
I need to stop.

36:05.364 --> 36:07.633
I need to...

36:07.666 --> 36:11.970
I need to step back from this,
whatever this is.

36:12.003 --> 36:15.006
It's just...
I can't get it straight.

36:16.842 --> 36:18.244
I almost got us
caught today.

36:18.277 --> 36:20.178
I can't even tell you why.

36:21.747 --> 36:24.550
I just told you.

36:24.583 --> 36:28.053
She's your
frozen lake, bro.

36:28.086 --> 36:32.524
My opinion --
she's Blackstone's, too.

36:40.532 --> 36:42.268
(buzzer, indistinct shouting
in distance)

37:00.286 --> 37:02.354
I wanted to
ask you something.

37:02.388 --> 37:05.291
Can I just --
What happened to your teeth?

37:05.324 --> 37:09.895
Some guy cut me
in line at dinner.

37:09.928 --> 37:11.897
Called me a fucking Jew.

37:11.930 --> 37:13.732
And I said, "Fuck you,
you're a Nazi."

37:13.765 --> 37:15.634
(chuckles)

37:15.667 --> 37:17.936
Guard hears this,
comes over,

37:17.969 --> 37:19.771
takes them out
with the stick.

37:19.805 --> 37:23.942
-I'm sorry about that.
-Well, don't be.

37:23.975 --> 37:26.445
Not about that.

37:27.646 --> 37:30.048
You can know the difference
between right and wrong

37:30.081 --> 37:32.984
and still not be
able to stop.

37:33.018 --> 37:34.386
That's what you said.

37:34.420 --> 37:36.221
Yes, I did.

37:36.254 --> 37:37.989
But who's deciding?

37:38.023 --> 37:40.726
That's what we have
to settle now.

37:40.759 --> 37:42.227
Just you and me.

37:42.260 --> 37:45.764
Right and wrong.

37:45.797 --> 37:50.001
Who's deciding
which is which?

37:50.035 --> 37:51.002
You tell me.

37:51.036 --> 37:54.139
Other people.

37:54.172 --> 37:56.575
Other people who don't think
about you for longer

37:56.608 --> 38:00.145
than they have to,
and then they're gone.

38:00.178 --> 38:01.447
How can you trust them?

38:02.648 --> 38:06.685
They don't know,
and they don't care.

38:06.718 --> 38:09.187
Trust yourself.

38:09.220 --> 38:10.822
What if you can't
trust yourself?

38:10.856 --> 38:12.591
Who's telling you that?

38:12.624 --> 38:15.427
And how can you
live that way?

38:15.461 --> 38:17.796
You can't.

38:17.829 --> 38:20.231
The way you feel
is all you have.

38:22.167 --> 38:23.769
Even if you're broken.

38:23.802 --> 38:26.972
What happens to you
happens to your life.

38:28.173 --> 38:31.877
What other way can you
be than who you are?

38:31.910 --> 38:33.579
(buzzer in distance)

38:40.051 --> 38:45.557
Lesson one --
don't get burned.

39:20.726 --> 39:23.061
(siren wails in distance)

41:05.864 --> 41:08.133
Jaclyn.

41:08.166 --> 41:09.868
What -- What -- No!
No! No.

41:09.901 --> 41:12.170
What was that today?

41:12.203 --> 41:13.972
What were you doing?
-You can't be here.

41:14.005 --> 41:15.473
You came to me,

41:15.507 --> 41:17.275
and you told me
that you had to get away.

41:17.308 --> 41:18.677
It was death -- him or you.

41:18.710 --> 41:21.813
Then I see you today
like that with him?

41:21.847 --> 41:24.382
I want to help you.
I'm trying to help you.

41:24.415 --> 41:26.117
I care about you.

41:26.151 --> 41:28.520
But I don't know what
the fuck is happening!

41:28.554 --> 41:30.188
He has something of mine,
all right?

41:30.221 --> 41:32.157
Something important.
-What? What does he have?

41:32.190 --> 41:33.224
My daughter.

41:33.258 --> 41:35.193
What do you mean?

41:35.226 --> 41:36.361
You told me
you had a miscarriage.

41:36.394 --> 41:37.796
I was 17.

41:37.829 --> 41:39.130
I wasn't married
to her father.

41:39.164 --> 41:40.298
I gave her up.

41:40.331 --> 41:42.701
We reconnected
two years ago.

41:42.734 --> 41:44.703
She's in school now --
Chico State.

41:44.736 --> 41:47.072
Raymond pays her tuition.

41:47.105 --> 41:48.473
Because she serves
a purpose for him.

41:48.506 --> 41:49.808
Why didn't you tell me?

41:49.841 --> 41:52.143
You think
he's gonna hurt her?

41:52.177 --> 41:54.846
He said as much,
which is why

41:54.880 --> 41:57.015
if he wants to get breakfast
or go shopping,

41:57.048 --> 41:58.550
I don't say no.

41:58.584 --> 42:00.451
Whatever he wants.

42:02.220 --> 42:03.388
Will she be all right?

42:03.421 --> 42:06.224
That's my problem.

42:06.257 --> 42:09.160
You're good.

42:09.194 --> 42:11.329
I know you are.

42:11.362 --> 42:13.665
But you're not
strong enough.

42:13.699 --> 42:16.501
It's not an insult.
No one is.

42:16.534 --> 42:18.770
There's always someone
strong enough.

42:20.572 --> 42:22.107
You're better than this.

42:25.076 --> 42:27.278
Whatever this is,

42:27.312 --> 42:30.616
it won't end
how you think.

42:42.493 --> 42:44.663
(car alarm chirps)

42:52.604 --> 42:54.806
(sighs)

43:42.287 --> 43:44.222
(cellphone vibrates)

43:50.829 --> 43:54.632
D:
Battle is a joyous thing.

43:54.666 --> 43:56.668
When we see that
our cause is just,

43:56.702 --> 43:59.304
tears come to our eyes.

43:59.337 --> 44:03.508
A sweet delight
fills our hearts.

44:03.541 --> 44:05.510
Do you think that someone
who has felt this

44:05.543 --> 44:07.645
is afraid of death?

44:10.415 --> 44:12.851
Doc, I know you called
a time-out,

44:12.884 --> 44:15.220
but you needed to see.

44:18.724 --> 44:21.492
ELDON: It's the woman
from the dog park.

44:21.526 --> 44:23.061
Yeah.

44:23.094 --> 44:24.796
She thought
he was a nice guy

44:24.830 --> 44:28.366
with a nice dog
helping her get settled.

44:28.399 --> 44:31.169
The other two he poached
from the Happy Hands bust.

44:31.202 --> 44:32.537
What do you mean
"poached"?

44:32.570 --> 44:35.707
What's he doing?
-Business.

44:37.208 --> 44:39.077
Trafficking women.

44:46.584 --> 44:49.187
He's getting them
ready to work...

44:49.220 --> 44:50.989
for him.

44:51.022 --> 44:53.992
Jaclyn, Jackie,
whatever her name is,

44:54.025 --> 44:56.828
your lady --

44:56.862 --> 44:59.530
she was telling the truth.
