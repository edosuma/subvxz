00:39.639 --> 00:42.437
We're not a threat. We're salvation.

00:42.609 --> 00:44.577
The world will have to deal with us.

00:46.679 --> 00:48.613
Previously on The 4400:

00:48.782 --> 00:51.649
What? So Navarro was really
some kind of mind reader?

00:51.818 --> 00:54.082
I believe "telepath" is the word
you're looking for.

00:54.254 --> 00:56.916
Just concentrate
on what you wanna ask me,

00:57.090 --> 00:58.284
and I'll hear you.

00:58.458 --> 00:59.948
He definitely knew
what we were thinking.

01:00.126 --> 01:02.117
I can think of a few
practical applications for it.

01:02.295 --> 01:03.922
You should've come to me first.

01:04.096 --> 01:06.031
I'd have treated you better
than they ever will.

01:06.199 --> 01:08.724
We're at war here.
Don't pick the losing side.

01:08.902 --> 01:13.737
There's a synthetic substance present
in the blood of every 4400.

01:13.907 --> 01:16.774
They call it promicin inhibitor.

01:16.943 --> 01:18.808
NTAC's been studying the 4400
since they got back.

01:18.978 --> 01:20.502
- They should've known.
- They do know.

01:20.680 --> 01:23.979
I was ordered to work on a drug
to suppress the production of promicin.

01:24.150 --> 01:27.278
Once I synthesized the inhibitor,
we gave it to every 4400.

01:27.454 --> 01:29.115
But if it comes down to a choice

01:29.289 --> 01:31.484
between the safety
of the American people

01:31.658 --> 01:36.857
and the welfare of the 4400, Tom,
that's no choice at all.

01:37.030 --> 01:39.590
Because if you're holding on to
any hope of keeping this covered up,

01:39.766 --> 01:43.167
you're gonna have to start by putting
me in the ground right here, right now.

01:43.937 --> 01:46.701
Every male in this building
has got a gallon of adrenaline

01:46.873 --> 01:49.501
coursing through his veins right now,
and most of them are armed.

01:51.144 --> 01:53.942
A 4400 nearly took down
a fortified government facility,

01:54.114 --> 01:55.638
and walked away
without breaking a sweat.

01:56.216 --> 01:58.684
I wasn't pregnant
when I was abducted,

01:58.852 --> 02:00.342
but I was when I got back.

02:00.520 --> 02:01.817
You've seen what she's capable of,

02:01.988 --> 02:03.649
what she can do
when she feels threatened.

02:03.823 --> 02:05.450
You know Isabelle has connections

02:05.625 --> 02:07.684
between the right
and left hemispheres of her brain

02:07.861 --> 02:09.089
that have never been seen before.

02:09.262 --> 02:10.695
You are the stewards of the future.

02:10.864 --> 02:12.297
Your daughter is the Rosetta stone

02:12.465 --> 02:14.160
for understanding
what happened to the 4400.

02:15.268 --> 02:17.065
Isabelle?

02:20.340 --> 02:21.398
Isabelle!.

02:21.975 --> 02:24.375
Hello, Shawn. I'm lsabelle.

02:31.651 --> 02:32.879
The world has changed.

02:33.486 --> 02:35.579
Everything is different now.

02:35.755 --> 02:37.985
The Promicin lnhibitor Program
was an international effort.

02:39.325 --> 02:42.158
Its goal was to prevent
the coming of a world

02:42.328 --> 02:45.263
dominated by a tiny fraction
of the population.

02:45.431 --> 02:47.922
In short, we were doing
everything we could

02:48.101 --> 02:52.561
to prevent the 4400 from developing
extra-human capabilities.

02:52.739 --> 02:55.503
We believe
that without the inhibitor program,

02:55.675 --> 02:58.109
these abilities would show up
in virtually every one of the 4400.

03:01.281 --> 03:03.146
I don't think I need to explain
to this committee

03:03.316 --> 03:07.013
why that would be something less
than the best-case scenario.

03:08.521 --> 03:10.386
Overnight, normal human beings
like you and I,

03:10.557 --> 03:12.286
and all the institutions
we've come to rely on

03:13.893 --> 03:15.622
would be obsolete.

03:20.466 --> 03:24.061
The program wasn't perfect.
People got sick. Some died.

03:24.237 --> 03:25.534
That was not our intent.

03:26.873 --> 03:28.841
But now it's gone.

03:30.376 --> 03:32.367
And the future that we were trying
to prevent is here,

03:32.545 --> 03:35.036
and we are not ready.

03:36.516 --> 03:38.677
I believe it comes down
to a question of power.

03:40.019 --> 03:43.386
Who is going to hold it?
Us or them?

03:43.556 --> 03:50.155
Because, believe me, it's going
to come down to us against them.

03:58.404 --> 04:01.464
Shawn, you're not making any sense.
Just tell me what's wrong with lsabelle.

04:01.641 --> 04:03.939
I told you, I can't explain.

04:04.110 --> 04:05.975
Is she sick? Is she hurt?

04:06.145 --> 04:08.238
You gotta see for yourself.

04:10.116 --> 04:11.413
Dad.

04:12.752 --> 04:14.652
Who the hell is this?
Where's lsabelle?

04:15.021 --> 04:17.079
I am your daughter. I'm lsabelle.

04:21.160 --> 04:23.651
- I don't get it.
- It's not a joke.

04:23.830 --> 04:26.560
Something happened. I changed.
I don't know how.

04:26.733 --> 04:28.132
She just walked in here.

04:28.301 --> 04:30.394
She knew my name. She seems
to know about you and Lily--

04:30.570 --> 04:31.867
Stop.

04:33.506 --> 04:36.964
I don't know what game
you're playing here, and I don't care.

04:37.610 --> 04:39.601
Richard. Richard...

04:43.616 --> 04:44.640
Lily.

04:45.985 --> 04:47.646
Lily.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.444
Lily?

04:50.423 --> 04:51.651
Is lsabelle with you?

04:52.925 --> 04:54.722
Lily? Lil--

04:57.363 --> 04:59.695
Lily, are you all right?

04:59.866 --> 05:02.494
Oh, Richard. I must've fainted.

05:03.770 --> 05:05.135
Is lsabelle with you?

05:06.472 --> 05:08.736
Who are you? Where's my wife?

05:08.908 --> 05:11.399
Richard, what are you talking about?

05:11.978 --> 05:14.344
I'm Lily, your wife.

05:14.514 --> 05:15.981
Why are you looking at me like--?

05:19.152 --> 05:22.144
- Oh, my God.
- Ma'am, I don't know who you are.

05:31.564 --> 05:32.656
Oh, my God.

05:41.607 --> 05:42.699
No!.

05:45.878 --> 05:49.075
Your blood pressure is elevated.

05:49.248 --> 05:52.012
But I suppose that's to be expected.

05:52.185 --> 05:56.849
Heart, lungs, reflexes,
all within the normal range.

05:57.623 --> 05:58.715
Doctor, you call this normal?

05:58.891 --> 06:01.792
Richard, I wanna see lsabelle.
Where is my daughter?

06:01.961 --> 06:03.895
She's right outside.
I'll bring her in in a minute.

06:04.063 --> 06:06.759
I realize how alarming this must be.

06:06.933 --> 06:08.764
But at least you can take
some solace in the fact

06:08.935 --> 06:11.062
that your wife is a perfectly healthy
older woman.

06:11.237 --> 06:14.206
If I had to guess,
I'd say she's about 75.

06:14.374 --> 06:17.104
I'm 29, and I don't understand.

06:17.276 --> 06:21.269
Please, help me understand.
How could this happen?

06:21.948 --> 06:26.044
Maybe it's a reaction to being taken off
the promicin inhibitor.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.914
But truthfully, I don't know.

06:28.087 --> 06:32.990
There is a condition called progeria.
It's associated with rapid aging.

06:33.159 --> 06:36.458
So this kind of thing
has happened before?

06:36.629 --> 06:40.224
Mr. Tyler, when your wife
fainted this morning,

06:40.400 --> 06:41.389
she was a young woman.

06:41.567 --> 06:43.660
When she woke up
less than a minute later,

06:43.836 --> 06:47.067
she was 50 years older.

06:47.240 --> 06:51.438
I can guarantee you, this is a first.

06:53.312 --> 06:55.109
Excuse me.

06:58.584 --> 07:01.815
- Are you okay, Dr. Burkhoff?
- I'm fine. Not enough sleep, that's all.

07:01.988 --> 07:03.580
Research.

07:03.756 --> 07:07.817
Well, what do we do now?
Is there any way to reverse this?

07:07.994 --> 07:13.296
I wish I knew.
I need to do some thinking.

07:21.908 --> 07:23.773
Are you my mother?

07:35.188 --> 07:37.019
Isabelle?

08:01.848 --> 08:06.148
Every day, the 4400 are changing
and getting stronger.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.753
Instead of mobilizing
to meet this challenge,

08:08.921 --> 08:12.652
we're wringing our hands and trying
to determine who knew what when.

08:13.092 --> 08:17.654
I will save this committee the trouble
and expense of a long investigation.

08:17.830 --> 08:20.196
The inhibitor program was my idea.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.932
I was proud to lead it.

08:23.102 --> 08:26.333
The men on this board
were simply following my orders.

08:26.506 --> 08:30.237
If there's blame to be assigned,
it's mine.

08:30.409 --> 08:32.206
Mine alone.

08:33.913 --> 08:35.403
Yeah, I know Kyle
doesn't wanna see me.

08:35.581 --> 08:37.071
Is there some way
we can force him to?

08:37.250 --> 08:39.878
I'm his father.
I wanna know how he's doing.

08:40.052 --> 08:41.212
Look, I realize you're trying,

08:41.386 --> 08:44.322
but it'll be months before he goes
to trial, I'm not gonna wait that long.

08:44.490 --> 08:46.890
Do you really think people
are gonna let Ryland position himself

08:47.059 --> 08:48.287
as some kind of patriotic martyr?

08:48.461 --> 08:51.294
The man headed a conspiracy
that caused 28 deaths.

08:51.464 --> 08:52.658
He says it was accidental.

08:52.832 --> 08:55.027
A significant percentage
of this country believes him.

08:55.201 --> 08:57.761
Try overwhelming.
You guys listen to talk radio lately?

08:57.937 --> 09:00.098
I mean, the calls are, like,
90 percent in his favor.

09:00.273 --> 09:02.798
You can buy a "Free Dennis Ryland"
T-shirt within a block of here.

09:02.975 --> 09:05.205
Maybe they should put him up
for the Nobel Peace Prize.

09:05.378 --> 09:08.108
Just tell him I need to see him.
We don't have to talk about the case.

09:08.281 --> 09:10.875
I just have to see my son.

09:13.085 --> 09:15.315
Just ask him one more time, okay?

09:15.488 --> 09:18.514
And tell him we love him.

09:20.293 --> 09:21.851
Give him some time, Thomas.

09:22.028 --> 09:25.088
Kyle needs to live with his choice
for a while.

09:25.731 --> 09:27.528
We're back.

09:29.168 --> 09:31.966
Tom, break's over.

09:47.853 --> 09:51.448
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like
to call the proceedings to order.

09:51.624 --> 09:53.854
Everyone, just take your seats
so we can get started.

09:54.560 --> 09:56.084
Members of the press,
I was including you

09:56.262 --> 09:59.425
in that "ladies and gentlemen"
designation, thank you.

10:00.466 --> 10:05.130
Mr. Ryland, I'd like to pick up
the questioning where we left off.

10:05.304 --> 10:07.431
You insist that you alone
gave the go-ahead

10:07.607 --> 10:10.303
for the Promicin lnhibitor Program,
is that right, sir?

10:10.476 --> 10:12.671
Yes, sir.
It was my program all the way.

10:12.845 --> 10:16.508
So this committee is to understand
that your department

10:16.682 --> 10:18.843
was able to plan and implement
an international conspiracy

10:20.853 --> 10:22.980
without some
Cabinet-level approval?

10:23.155 --> 10:25.385
That's correct.
I was given a broad mandate

10:25.558 --> 10:28.049
in my duties as head of NTAC.

10:28.227 --> 10:30.855
I felt that the project fell
within that mandate.

10:31.030 --> 10:34.295
So there was no need
to seek outside approval--

10:37.336 --> 10:40.464
- Excuse us, everybody.
- Did you hear that?

10:40.640 --> 10:42.301
Well, yeah, the microphones
went haywire.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.705
No, not that. Something else.

10:45.177 --> 10:48.078
Just set that approval issue to the side
for the moment.

10:50.383 --> 10:53.841
Did you ever discuss the project
with anyone outside of NTAC?

10:54.020 --> 10:56.215
I mean, someone, somewhere,
must have taken an interest

10:56.389 --> 10:58.084
in what your people
were doing over there.

10:58.257 --> 10:59.747
- Listen to me.
- What? What's wrong?

10:59.925 --> 11:02.553
- A simple question, Mr. Ryland.
- What do you mean, "What's wrong"?

11:03.663 --> 11:06.962
Surely, it can't be that difficult
to answer.

11:07.767 --> 11:09.667
If I could have your attention
up here, Mr. Ryland.

11:09.835 --> 11:11.860
You need to relax, Miles.

11:21.080 --> 11:23.173
Security!. Stop that man!

11:29.355 --> 11:32.119
Get some protection on Ryland.
Stay here. I'll be right back.

11:32.291 --> 11:34.555
We need an ambulance!
Someone call an ambulance!

11:34.727 --> 11:36.217
Stand back, please. Back. Back.

11:42.134 --> 11:43.726
Hey!

11:58.584 --> 12:00.245
Stop! T.J.!

12:10.896 --> 12:12.989
Someone get these photographers
out of here.

12:13.165 --> 12:14.530
You stay with him.

12:14.700 --> 12:17.032
I don't understand what I did.

12:17.203 --> 12:20.695
Would somebody please tell me
what I just did?

12:22.708 --> 12:25.871
Hang on, Dennis.
The ambulance is coming.

12:33.519 --> 12:34.645
Yeah, it was her.

12:34.820 --> 12:37.618
The blood we picked up at the scene
matches the DNA in our records.

12:37.790 --> 12:39.519
That was T.J. Kim running
from the courthouse.

12:39.692 --> 12:41.990
When she hit this place,
T.J. drove every man in the building

12:42.161 --> 12:43.287
into a homicidal rage.

12:43.462 --> 12:45.794
Now it sounds like
she just zapped one guy.

12:45.965 --> 12:48.525
She's learning to control
what she can do. They all are.

12:48.701 --> 12:50.293
Ever since we took them off
the inhibitor,

12:50.469 --> 12:52.027
they're either developing
new abilities,

12:52.204 --> 12:54.069
or they're refining the ones
that they've got.

12:54.240 --> 12:57.300
So they are getting more dangerous.
I guess Ryland was right.

12:57.476 --> 12:59.103
I'll be sure to mention that
to my daughter.

12:59.278 --> 13:01.212
Okay, save the point-counterpoint.

13:01.380 --> 13:03.177
At the moment,
we've been tasked with two jobs.

13:03.349 --> 13:06.318
We track down T.J. Kim.
What's the second job?

13:06.485 --> 13:08.282
We are to protect Ryland's
co-conspirators

13:08.454 --> 13:09.512
from any further reprisals.

13:09.688 --> 13:11.622
So we arrest them,
and now we're their bodyguards?

13:11.791 --> 13:15.090
Well, the entire country just saw
a 4400 turn a government hearing

13:15.261 --> 13:16.694
into her own personal slasher film.

13:17.029 --> 13:20.396
If T.J. gets to Ryland again, or any
of them, before we can bring her in,

13:20.566 --> 13:22.966
people are gonna start to wonder
if the United States government

13:23.135 --> 13:24.625
is capable of protecting its citizens.

13:25.137 --> 13:27.162
And that's the beginning of chaos.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.301
Back to work, please.

13:38.884 --> 13:40.374
Tom.

13:40.719 --> 13:45.281
In case you're wondering,
Dennis is still in surgery.

13:45.457 --> 13:48.290
They say that it is touch-and-go.

14:16.589 --> 14:19.217
It's okay. Give me your hands.
Try and relax.

14:19.391 --> 14:20.619
Relax.

14:40.312 --> 14:42.007
Is it better?

14:44.850 --> 14:46.647
Much better.

14:49.855 --> 14:50.913
For now.

14:55.928 --> 14:58.192
When this thing first came on,
it was bad,

14:58.364 --> 14:59.626
but at least she was healthy.

14:59.798 --> 15:01.629
Now she's had diabetes,
emphysema.

15:01.800 --> 15:03.427
Seems like every day,
there's something new.

15:03.602 --> 15:05.126
I'll come help her every day.

15:05.304 --> 15:06.896
Listen, we got everyone
working on this.

15:07.072 --> 15:08.334
We're gonna figure it out.

15:08.507 --> 15:11.704
- Is my mother okay?
- Yeah.

15:12.278 --> 15:15.008
She had a little problem.
Shawn fixed it.

15:15.180 --> 15:17.307
It's all in the wrists.

15:17.883 --> 15:18.941
Can I see her?

15:22.888 --> 15:24.082
Please?

15:32.631 --> 15:34.223
Mom?

15:37.970 --> 15:39.870
Isabelle.

15:41.040 --> 15:44.134
- Come here.
- Is there anything I can do?

15:44.710 --> 15:49.113
I'm fine. Really. Sit down.

15:54.420 --> 15:56.820
You were such a beautiful baby.

15:56.989 --> 15:59.423
I used to hold you all day long.

15:59.591 --> 16:03.288
I knew exactly what you were feeling,
what you wanted.

16:03.696 --> 16:04.993
We were so close.

16:05.164 --> 16:08.895
I'm sorry for growing up so fast.
I didn't mean to.

16:09.068 --> 16:11.002
I didn't want to.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.999
Neither did l.

16:18.911 --> 16:23.143
Crazy thing is, I keep thinking
about Patty, Ryland's wife.

16:23.315 --> 16:26.182
I feel like I should call her
or something, help her through this.

16:26.352 --> 16:29.150
Maybe you should. You and Ryland
were friends for a long time.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.149
It's okay to be conflicted.

16:31.323 --> 16:34.815
Yeah, well, Ryland's little experiment
almost got you killed. Shawn too.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.656
The guy knew that Kyle was stalking
Jordan Collier and he did nothing.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.559
I'd say that trumps friendship.

16:41.100 --> 16:42.829
You have so much on your mind.

16:43.302 --> 16:46.465
Kyle, Ryland, the 4400s.

16:46.638 --> 16:49.903
I need to get you away from here,
away from your problems.

16:50.075 --> 16:53.567
Yeah, well, it sounds nice.
But I can't go anywhere.

16:53.746 --> 16:56.271
I'm starting investigation
in the morning.

16:56.448 --> 16:58.348
What if I told you
I could take you away

16:58.517 --> 17:00.781
between now and then?

17:02.488 --> 17:04.183
My ability.

17:04.356 --> 17:10.192
Since I'm off the inhibitor,
I think I can control it now.

17:10.896 --> 17:12.887
What, you mean you wanna--?

17:13.065 --> 17:15.363
You wanna take me into another
dream world? Alternate real--?

17:15.534 --> 17:18.367
- I don't even know what to call it.
- Call it a vacation.

17:18.537 --> 17:23.372
A week. A year. As long as we want.

17:23.976 --> 17:26.069
All that in the space
of a few moments.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.878
Should we try it?

17:30.749 --> 17:33.343
What, right here? Now?

17:34.953 --> 17:38.548
- What do we do?
- We're already doing it.

17:49.334 --> 17:51.063
There's no one on the beach.

17:51.236 --> 17:54.603
It's all ours, Thomas, so is the hotel.

17:54.773 --> 17:57.503
We can stay here
for as long as we like.

17:57.676 --> 17:59.507
There is no jet lag.

17:59.678 --> 18:02.943
That sounds perfect.
It is perfect too.

18:27.139 --> 18:28.800
The door's open. Come in.

18:32.144 --> 18:34.442
What? What is it?

18:36.448 --> 18:38.814
- You're naked.
- I'm more comfortable this way.

18:38.984 --> 18:41.646
Haven't really gotten used
to them. Clothes.

18:42.321 --> 18:43.720
I have a bathrobe.

18:49.228 --> 18:51.162
Is this better?

18:53.465 --> 18:55.228
Almost.

18:57.469 --> 18:58.993
Just--

19:14.653 --> 19:16.518
Never met anybody
that read the encyclopedia

19:16.688 --> 19:18.986
- from cover to cover before.
- Oh, I'm not finished.

19:19.158 --> 19:22.150
I just delivered those
to you yesterday.

19:22.995 --> 19:25.520
Okay, you're a fast reader.
That's really cool.

19:26.598 --> 19:28.657
Listen, they're looking for you
down in the labs.

19:28.834 --> 19:29.858
You're like an hour late.

19:30.235 --> 19:31.862
They sent you to get me?

19:34.473 --> 19:36.907
- Aren't you in charge?
- Well, yeah, more or less.

19:37.075 --> 19:38.542
You know, I go where I'm needed.

19:39.444 --> 19:41.207
They were scared of me,
weren't they?

19:41.380 --> 19:42.745
- Pretty much.
- That's all right.

19:42.915 --> 19:44.542
I think my parents are frightened of me.

19:44.716 --> 19:46.707
I don't think your mom and dad
are scared of you.

19:46.885 --> 19:48.011
I think they're just confused.

19:48.187 --> 19:51.088
I don't blame them.
It's mostly how I feel too.

19:51.256 --> 19:53.918
I don't understand
what happened to me.

19:54.092 --> 19:56.219
I don't understand
what happened to my mother.

19:56.595 --> 20:02.261
And I'm trying to read and learn things,
but mostly, I just--

20:02.534 --> 20:04.365
I still feel lost.

20:04.870 --> 20:07.600
See, now you sound like
a real 4400.

20:08.106 --> 20:11.132
But I'm not a 4400.

20:11.677 --> 20:17.445
Not like my mother and father,
or you.

20:21.820 --> 20:23.651
Looks like I'm gonna live.

20:24.089 --> 20:26.751
Sorry to disappoint you, Tom.

20:29.027 --> 20:30.585
Why'd you ask to see me, Dennis?

20:31.263 --> 20:35.427
I hear that you and Skouris
are in charge of the investigation.

20:35.601 --> 20:37.796
Yeah. We know who did it.
We'll find her.

20:38.303 --> 20:42.103
T.J. Kim attacked this building
six weeks ago.

20:42.274 --> 20:44.105
No one's tracked her down yet?

20:44.276 --> 20:46.642
We got a little sidetracked
cleaning up your mess, Dennis.

20:46.812 --> 20:49.144
Did you ever think
that maybe she has help?

20:49.314 --> 20:55.719
Other 4400s who feel the same way
about the government she does?

20:55.887 --> 20:57.445
When we catch her, we'll ask.

20:58.824 --> 20:59.848
Will you?

21:01.126 --> 21:06.189
I wanna make sure you're gonna take
this thing as far as it goes, Tom.

21:06.365 --> 21:09.300
The same way you did
when you came after me.

21:10.969 --> 21:14.803
And I want my people protected.

21:14.973 --> 21:17.032
They were acting under my orders.

21:17.209 --> 21:18.198
They're under guard.

21:18.377 --> 21:21.039
So was the courthouse
when Kim attacked.

21:21.580 --> 21:26.381
I'd feel better if you brought them in.

21:27.419 --> 21:30.445
We offered sanctuary
to every single conspirator.

21:30.622 --> 21:32.180
There were no takers.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.256
I guess no one wanted to cooperate

21:35.427 --> 21:37.827
with the organization
that was working to put you in prison.

21:37.996 --> 21:39.554
We had to fight
just to get them to let us

21:39.731 --> 21:41.699
post agents outside their houses.

21:41.867 --> 21:45.132
Crocket, are you ready to go
for a walk, boy?

21:46.204 --> 21:47.398
Come on, Crocket. Let's go.

21:47.572 --> 21:49.039
They wanted no part of us.

21:49.207 --> 21:53.109
They all seemed confident
that T.J. Kim was acting alone.

21:58.083 --> 21:59.573
Crock?

21:59.751 --> 22:01.218
What's wrong? It's me.

22:37.255 --> 22:40.315
This just arrived 1 5 minutes ago.

22:41.326 --> 22:43.226
This is a message
from the Nova Group.

22:43.395 --> 22:46.262
We are the defensive wing
of the 4400.

22:46.431 --> 22:47.591
Today, the world has seen

22:47.766 --> 22:50.030
what happens to those
who try to harm us.

22:50.202 --> 22:52.193
A second demonstration
of our capabilities

22:52.371 --> 22:54.737
is planned for October 1 9th.

22:54.906 --> 22:56.373
A new era dawns.

22:56.541 --> 22:57.872
Defensive wing, huh?

22:58.076 --> 22:59.805
What happens
when they decide to play offense?

22:59.978 --> 23:02.640
- I guess we find out in five days.
- They didn't say what they want.

23:02.814 --> 23:04.645
No demands.
No room for compromise.

23:04.816 --> 23:07.011
We don't even know how many 4400s
are in this Nova Group.

23:07.185 --> 23:10.052
We couldn't handle one when she
walked in here and attacked the place.

23:10.222 --> 23:12.782
Now there's a whole team of assassins
out there, all with abilities?

23:12.958 --> 23:15.984
They got someone who can kill you
by lowering your body temperature.

23:16.161 --> 23:17.719
Don't forget the beast master.

23:17.896 --> 23:19.955
What? That dog got pissed off
pretty quick.

23:20.132 --> 23:21.258
I've been all over the files,

23:21.433 --> 23:23.901
and none of these abilities
have been registered with us.

23:24.069 --> 23:26.003
They're off the inhibitor now.
We can't even pretend

23:26.171 --> 23:28.332
to have a comprehensive list
of what these people can do.

23:28.507 --> 23:32.238
Is anyone else feeling
a little overmatched here?

23:40.419 --> 23:42.649
You two remember Gary Navarro?

23:43.855 --> 23:46.619
Hey, Gary. Been a while.

23:48.026 --> 23:49.891
You're right, Baldwin.

23:50.061 --> 23:51.926
I do think you two sold me out.

23:52.097 --> 23:53.621
It really bothered me for a while,

23:53.799 --> 23:56.063
but now I understand
it's just standard operating procedure.

23:56.234 --> 23:58.702
Well, I guess that mind-reading thing's
working pretty well, huh?

23:58.870 --> 23:59.894
Better than ever, actually.

24:00.071 --> 24:01.971
Gary's telepathic abilities
have been very useful

24:02.140 --> 24:03.937
to the National Security Agency.

24:04.109 --> 24:06.805
They've agreed to let us borrow him
while we investigate the Nova Group.

24:06.978 --> 24:08.206
You're clear on what we're doing?

24:08.380 --> 24:11.008
You want to use a 4400
to track down other 4400s.

24:11.183 --> 24:13.117
- Do you have a problem with that?
- Not at all.

24:13.385 --> 24:14.818
It won't be my first time.

24:16.455 --> 24:19.686
So can we get started?

24:23.395 --> 24:26.421
Never heard of the Nova Group.
Not until this morning, anyway.

24:26.598 --> 24:28.065
Now I gotta go on television
in an hour

24:28.233 --> 24:30.565
and explain that the Center
had nothing to do with this.

24:30.735 --> 24:31.724
Shawn.

24:32.237 --> 24:34.728
I know there's a lot of history
between NTAC and this place.

24:34.906 --> 24:36.897
But I trust you realize
how serious this is.

24:37.075 --> 24:39.703
Believe me, if I knew anything,
I would tell you.

24:39.878 --> 24:42.176
Well, do you mind if the three of us
walk around the place,

24:42.347 --> 24:44.247
- talk to people?
- You and your pet mind reader?

24:44.416 --> 24:45.815
No, I can't let you do that.

24:45.984 --> 24:47.508
These people
haven't done anything wrong.

24:47.686 --> 24:49.085
I won't let you invade their privacy.

24:49.254 --> 24:51.882
And I actually can't believe
that you brought this guy here again.

24:52.691 --> 24:54.852
How much do they pay you
to spy on your own kind?

24:55.026 --> 24:58.189
Are you getting a clear signal?
See anything you like up there?

25:00.832 --> 25:02.561
As far as I can tell,
he's not hiding anything.

25:04.803 --> 25:07.966
I have a lot of work to do.
If I hear anything, I'll give you a call.

25:08.139 --> 25:10.369
For now, that's the best I can do.

25:21.820 --> 25:23.014
Sorry about my nephew.

25:23.889 --> 25:26.289
- Why?
- He was kind of rude back there.

25:26.458 --> 25:29.018
I get that kind of stuff a lot.
I don't take it personally.

25:29.194 --> 25:30.286
You mind if I ask you--?

25:30.462 --> 25:34.125
You've sort of implied
that you've pursued 4400s in the past.

25:34.299 --> 25:36.358
What exactly do you do
for the NSA?

25:36.535 --> 25:39.629
- Overseas stuff, mostly.
- But like what? Give me an example.

25:40.171 --> 25:41.763
They fly me someplace.

25:41.940 --> 25:44.568
I approach the subject,
find out what he's thinking.

25:44.743 --> 25:46.438
And I tell the people I work for,

25:46.611 --> 25:48.806
who then fly me home
where I live comfortably.

25:48.980 --> 25:50.743
What happens to the subject?

25:52.417 --> 25:53.782
I don't ask.

26:05.830 --> 26:07.058
That's good.

26:07.232 --> 26:09.723
The neural pathway comparisons
are particularly illuminating.

26:09.901 --> 26:11.801
Make sure you understand them
before you move on.

26:12.137 --> 26:14.970
Dr. Burkhoff,
I don't understand any of this.

26:15.140 --> 26:17.734
A bunch of her neurons
don't work anymore.

26:17.909 --> 26:20.571
Every time one of hers turns off,
one of mine turns on.

26:20.745 --> 26:21.973
Exactly.

26:22.147 --> 26:23.910
And what's true for neurons

26:24.082 --> 26:26.482
is true for muscle fibers,
synaptic pathways.

26:26.918 --> 26:31.082
There is a one-to-one
correspondence

26:31.256 --> 26:34.157
between the amount you lost
and the amount you gained.

26:34.326 --> 26:36.590
So all this is just a way
of saying I'm doing this to her?

26:36.761 --> 26:40.288
The correlation is too precise
to be random.

26:40.465 --> 26:45.129
Your rapid aging
has caused her rapid aging.

26:45.303 --> 26:47.464
How do we stop it?
Put me back the way I was?

26:47.639 --> 26:50.107
- I'm afraid I can't.
- So, what do we do about it?

26:50.275 --> 26:54.837
There is a possibility
that if the aging agent were eliminated,

26:55.013 --> 26:57.481
that Lily might be restored
to her normal self.

26:57.649 --> 27:00.174
- The aging agent?
- He means me.

27:00.352 --> 27:01.614
I'm killing you.

27:01.786 --> 27:04.254
The only way for you to live
is for me to die. Isn't that right?

27:04.422 --> 27:06.083
Don't answer that, Dr. Burkhoff.

27:06.257 --> 27:09.522
Thank you for your time,
but we're done here.

27:10.195 --> 27:12.095
Where are you going?

27:12.497 --> 27:14.965
We're not discussing this.

27:15.133 --> 27:16.327
Not now.

27:17.068 --> 27:18.695
Not ever.

27:26.311 --> 27:29.769
- It's true, isn't it?
- I think so.

27:35.286 --> 27:36.719
But it's only a theory.

27:38.790 --> 27:41.156
Guys, I went over this six weeks ago
with the men in black.

27:41.326 --> 27:42.418
Humor us.

27:42.594 --> 27:45.722
I went on two dates with T.J. Kim.
Then I cut it off.

27:45.897 --> 27:47.888
- Girl had a lot of baggage.
- How long ago was that?

27:48.066 --> 27:49.431
About two months ago.

27:49.601 --> 27:51.364
If I'd known there would be
government agents

27:51.536 --> 27:53.697
showing up every other day
to ask me about her,

27:53.872 --> 27:54.930
I would've taken notes.

27:56.741 --> 28:00.768
Hey, so listen.
All this stuff about October 1 9th,

28:00.945 --> 28:02.537
you guys think it's serious?

28:03.782 --> 28:05.647
I mean, like,
should I be getting out of town?

28:06.084 --> 28:07.278
I don't think that's the answer.

28:07.452 --> 28:09.886
As far as we know,
you're as safe here as anywhere else.

28:13.058 --> 28:16.255
That kid was lying. Or at least
he wasn't telling you everything.

28:16.428 --> 28:17.918
The whole time
you were talking to him,

28:18.096 --> 28:19.620
he was thinking about an address.

28:19.798 --> 28:21.732
331 Reynolds Avenue.

28:35.246 --> 28:38.079
Looks like it's clear. Nobody's home.

28:38.249 --> 28:40.945
Nobody's been home for a while,
I'd say.

28:42.787 --> 28:44.448
Look at this.

28:44.622 --> 28:47.557
It's the government report
on the return of the 4400.

28:47.726 --> 28:48.920
I tried to read this once.

28:49.561 --> 28:50.653
Kind of dry.

28:53.965 --> 28:57.423
It looks like someone made it
right through to the end.

29:01.539 --> 29:03.507
"Wesley Hauser."

29:06.177 --> 29:10.238
- "Wesley Hauser. Wesley Hauser."
- Who the hell is Wesley Hauser?

29:10.482 --> 29:14.441
Hauser was a Marine.
Did two tours of duty in Vietnam.

29:14.619 --> 29:17.850
He led protests against the war
after he got home in '72.

29:18.022 --> 29:19.114
Disappeared in '75.

29:19.290 --> 29:21.417
Once he got out of quarantine,
he never checked back in.

29:21.593 --> 29:23.686
Guy's been living off the grid
for almost two years.

29:23.862 --> 29:25.796
Which means he never went
on the inhibitor.

29:25.964 --> 29:27.932
So who knows
what he's capable of by now.

29:28.099 --> 29:30.567
He was disillusioned with the
government before he disappeared.

29:30.735 --> 29:33.295
I wouldn't say we've done much
to win him over since he's been back.

29:33.471 --> 29:35.769
When he was in quarantine,
he was housed in barracks three,

29:35.940 --> 29:37.464
same building as T.J. Kim.

29:37.876 --> 29:40.470
An agitator. An organizer. A radical.

29:40.645 --> 29:42.806
Sounds like we have our
second member of the Nova Group.

29:45.650 --> 29:47.117
Baldwin.

29:48.820 --> 29:49.946
You're kidding me.

29:50.221 --> 29:52.052
All right. All right. I know.
Put him through.

29:52.490 --> 29:55.516
- He says he's Wesley Hauser.
- No way.

29:58.630 --> 29:59.892
Yeah, hello?

30:00.064 --> 30:01.725
How'd you like my apartment?

30:01.900 --> 30:04.198
Well, to be honest, it felt a little empty
without you there.

30:04.369 --> 30:07.270
I'm on a tight schedule.
A lot to do before next week.

30:07.438 --> 30:10.305
Sounds like you have interesting plans.
Why don't we get together someplace,

30:10.475 --> 30:12.739
- talk them over?
- No more talking.

30:12.911 --> 30:16.210
There's nothing to say.
Your time is ending.

30:16.381 --> 30:18.212
Ours begins October 19th.

30:25.290 --> 30:26.279
Come on. Let me go.

30:27.625 --> 30:29.286
Why'd you run
when we asked you about Hauser?

30:30.094 --> 30:31.721
You two used to eat together
in quarantine.

30:31.896 --> 30:33.761
- We've got it on camera.
- So...?

30:33.932 --> 30:35.399
The guy had a lot
of good war stories.

30:35.567 --> 30:37.558
- Doesn't make us best friends.
- So why did you run?

30:37.735 --> 30:40.135
Because when I see NTAC agents,
I run the other way.

30:40.305 --> 30:44.173
You people almost killed us all.
Can you blame me?

30:46.744 --> 30:49.008
Turn around. Turn around.

30:53.384 --> 30:56.319
- Are we done here?
- Get out of here.

30:58.590 --> 31:00.558
I mean, call me sensitive,

31:00.959 --> 31:03.951
but I felt like saying to him,
"We exposed the inhibitor.

31:04.128 --> 31:06.392
We saved your life."

31:09.934 --> 31:12.630
You guys just don't really get it,
do you?

31:12.804 --> 31:14.396
It's not just that guy.

31:14.572 --> 31:17.700
Every 4400 we've talked to today,
they're scared of you.

31:18.076 --> 31:19.941
Or they don't trust you.
Or they hate you.

31:20.378 --> 31:22.141
I'm sorry, but the days
when you could expect

31:22.313 --> 31:24.907
friendly conversation
from these people, they're gone.

31:25.383 --> 31:27.442
You're the bad guys now.

31:27.952 --> 31:29.749
Get used to it.

31:40.798 --> 31:42.789
Now, I'm just warning you,
motherhood's no cakewalk.

31:42.967 --> 31:45.026
Since when are you an expert?

31:45.203 --> 31:49.196
I'm only saying she landed on twins.
Kind of a big responsibility.

31:49.374 --> 31:51.865
Especially when she's trying to get by
on a teacher's salary.

31:52.043 --> 31:55.171
- What are you gonna name them?
- I don't really want to play anymore.

31:55.346 --> 31:57.940
- Is that okay?
- Oh, what's wrong, sweetheart?

31:58.316 --> 32:00.944
Nothing,
except I know Marco's gonna win,

32:01.119 --> 32:04.714
I'm gonna come second, and you're
gonna end up alone with no money.

32:10.662 --> 32:11.651
Don't be jealous.

32:11.829 --> 32:14.992
He is smarter than you,
but Mom likes you better.

32:20.438 --> 32:22.463
So who's smarter than me?

32:22.941 --> 32:24.704
Who knows?

32:25.376 --> 32:27.844
I'm not even sure
she knows exactly.

32:28.012 --> 32:30.242
In some ways she was better off
on the promicin inhibitor.

32:30.415 --> 32:32.542
At least she wasn't overwhelmed
back then.

32:33.051 --> 32:36.987
All she wants to do is record
what she sees in those notebooks.

32:37.555 --> 32:40.683
It's like some kind of compulsion.

32:42.293 --> 32:45.854
Well, think about it for a minute.

32:46.097 --> 32:50.056
Every morning she wakes up
and knows pretty much what's coming.

32:50.401 --> 32:52.767
She's already lived the whole day
once in her head.

32:52.937 --> 32:54.996
By the time
something actually does happen,

32:55.173 --> 32:56.162
it's like a rerun.

32:56.341 --> 33:00.471
- I hate watching reruns.
- Yeah, try living one.

33:01.646 --> 33:03.079
Hey, what about Kevin Burkhoff?

33:03.815 --> 33:06.545
Maybe he can figure out a way
for Maia to control her visions.

33:06.918 --> 33:10.217
- He's brilliant.
- I don't say this about many people,

33:10.388 --> 33:12.322
but he is smarter than me.

33:17.362 --> 33:18.351
I know you.

33:18.529 --> 33:21.657
- Of course you do. It's Diana Skouris.
- You work at NTAC.

33:21.833 --> 33:25.564
I'm not here on business, though.
I'm here about my daughter, Maia.

33:25.970 --> 33:28.666
The precog. What about her?

33:28.840 --> 33:31.400
She's still 1 0, right?
She's not 65 now, is she?

33:31.943 --> 33:33.877
Interesting guess.

33:34.045 --> 33:37.037
- Kind of wide of the mark, though.
- Good.

33:42.954 --> 33:44.979
Might as well come on in.

33:45.590 --> 33:47.353
Thank you.

33:49.494 --> 33:51.962
- Oh, sorry about the clutter.
- That's okay.

33:52.130 --> 33:55.725
I fired the maid last week.
She was always cleaning.

34:01.305 --> 34:03.068
Excuse me.

34:06.277 --> 34:10.235
So your daughter,

34:11.815 --> 34:12.804
what's troubling her?

35:18.015 --> 35:19.812
I'll let you do it.

35:20.485 --> 35:22.043
I caused all this, right?

35:22.587 --> 35:24.817
And getting rid of me is the only way
to save my mother.

35:24.989 --> 35:25.978
No.

35:26.157 --> 35:28.057
That's what you were thinking,
wasn't it?

35:28.292 --> 35:29.589
No, it wasn't.

35:29.760 --> 35:31.125
I don't want her to die either.

35:31.295 --> 35:34.196
So I'll let you do it.
I'll even shut my eyes.

35:34.899 --> 35:38.858
Isabelle, I would never hurt you.

35:39.837 --> 35:41.361
Why?

35:42.340 --> 35:44.205
I don't understand.
It's the only way to save her.

35:44.375 --> 35:45.364
We don't know that.

35:45.543 --> 35:47.636
And I won't make a choice
between the two of you.

35:48.412 --> 35:49.811
Won't or can't?

36:03.928 --> 36:06.920
Sorry. I don't mean
to invade anyone's space.

36:07.098 --> 36:10.431
Oh, that's okay. It's not my desk.

36:10.902 --> 36:13.530
But it looks like you'll be here
for a while now, huh?

36:13.704 --> 36:16.104
Assuming this place is still standing
on October 20th, yeah.

36:16.274 --> 36:20.233
Maybe we should talk to Jarvis.
Get you a room of your very own.

36:20.411 --> 36:21.503
That's fine with me.

36:23.047 --> 36:25.914
To tell you the truth,
I could use a little bit of a buffer zone.

36:28.019 --> 36:32.683
This problem you're having
with your daughter's precog ability.

36:33.858 --> 36:36.383
I keep wanting to give you
my opinion.

36:36.561 --> 36:37.960
But I don't want to intrude.

36:38.129 --> 36:41.690
So you are listening to my thoughts.

36:42.066 --> 36:45.502
You and Baldwin. I can't help it.

36:45.770 --> 36:46.794
I try to tune you guys out,

36:46.971 --> 36:49.439
but every now and then
something leaks through.

36:49.974 --> 36:52.340
I'll try to keep that in mind.

36:55.846 --> 36:59.282
You said you had an opinion
about Maia. What is it?

36:59.817 --> 37:03.981
When I first developed
this thing of mine,

37:04.322 --> 37:06.654
I was a basket case. You saw me.

37:06.824 --> 37:09.258
I truly thought I was going insane.

37:09.493 --> 37:12.155
So I fought against it.

37:12.496 --> 37:14.396
And that just made it worse.

37:14.565 --> 37:17.830
I had to give in to it,
let it take control of me.

37:18.469 --> 37:22.997
And then slowly,
I learned how to take control of it.

37:23.574 --> 37:24.905
Listen, your kid stops fighting,

37:25.076 --> 37:30.446
and eventually it'll become like seeing,
or hearing, or any other sense.

37:30.615 --> 37:32.310
She won't even think about it.

37:33.351 --> 37:35.819
It's just a part of who she is.

37:39.557 --> 37:41.650
That's how it worked for me,
anyway.

37:45.263 --> 37:46.696
Thank you.

37:47.298 --> 37:49.027
Diana, we just got a call
from Seattle police.

37:49.200 --> 37:53.034
Someone down there read our APB.
They know exactly where Hauser is.

37:56.307 --> 37:59.140
You guys are lucky, actually.
In another day or two,

37:59.310 --> 38:01.369
we would've buried him
in the potter's field.

38:01.545 --> 38:03.945
- Buried who?
- Him.

38:04.115 --> 38:05.480
I always read the APB memos

38:05.650 --> 38:08.050
when they circulate
in the police department.

38:08.219 --> 38:09.811
Kind of a hobby.

38:09.987 --> 38:11.352
Gets boring in here.

38:11.856 --> 38:14.154
Anyway, there was a description
of a regimental tattoo

38:14.325 --> 38:15.383
on the memo for Hauser.

38:15.559 --> 38:18.119
82nd Airborne.
"Death From Above."

38:18.296 --> 38:20.821
I remember it from a John Doe
they brought in here three weeks ago.

38:21.365 --> 38:22.730
This guy drowned in the harbor.

38:22.900 --> 38:25.198
Well, a lot of veterans
have that tattoo.

38:25.369 --> 38:28.532
Do a lot of veterans look exactly
like the mug shot you circulated?

38:29.674 --> 38:32.074
Don't believe me?
Take a look for yourselves.

38:35.079 --> 38:37.877
Say hello to Wesley Hauser.

38:44.088 --> 38:46.454
Hauser died two and a half weeks
before Ryland was attacked.

38:46.624 --> 38:48.615
Obviously, that wasn't him
on the phone the other day.

38:48.793 --> 38:52.559
And that copy of the 4400 report
with all his notes over it?

38:52.730 --> 38:55.221
For all we know,
that could've been a plant.

38:55.399 --> 38:56.696
Somebody wanted us distracted.

38:56.867 --> 38:58.266
They deliberately put us on the trail

38:58.436 --> 39:00.370
of some phantom member
of the Nova Group.

39:00.538 --> 39:02.028
How did we first find out
about Hauser?

39:02.206 --> 39:04.197
T.J.'s old boyfriend
gave us the address.

39:04.375 --> 39:05.933
No, he was thinking it.

39:07.778 --> 39:09.211
At least according to Gary he was.

39:09.380 --> 39:11.905
Gary Navarro put us
on to Wesley Hauser.

39:34.138 --> 39:35.127
Get in.

39:41.946 --> 39:43.971
You lied to me, Daniel.

39:44.148 --> 39:46.241
You never said anything
about killing people.

39:46.417 --> 39:48.544
No, we were protecting you, Shawn.

39:48.719 --> 39:51.950
If we tell you in advance,
you're culpable.

39:57.061 --> 39:59.723
- What is she doing here?
- She's dying. She needs your help.

39:59.897 --> 40:02.991
I told you, I don't want anything more
to do with you.

40:03.167 --> 40:04.794
The Nova Group
was supposed to protect us.

40:04.969 --> 40:06.698
That's why I gave you money,
Daniel.

40:06.871 --> 40:09.840
That's why I gave you money.
Not to start a terrorist organization!

40:10.007 --> 40:11.440
We'll talk about your concerns later.

40:11.609 --> 40:13.372
She's got a stomach wound
and it's infected.

40:13.544 --> 40:16.274
She needs you right now
or she's not gonna make it.

40:16.447 --> 40:19.382
Shawn, she's a 4400.

40:19.550 --> 40:22.610
And if we don't help each other,
what hope do we have?

40:27.091 --> 40:28.888
Give me your hand.

41:55.846 --> 41:57.211
What are you doing here?

41:58.516 --> 42:01.144
You're awake. Good.

42:03.087 --> 42:05.555
It's important
that you know it was me.

42:10.895 --> 42:12.863
I'm the guy who killed you.

42:36.453 --> 42:38.944
Med post, do you have a 20
on Gary Navarro?

42:39.490 --> 42:43.221
- Yeah, he just walked by. Why?
- Get him.

42:43.394 --> 42:44.827
Hey. Stop!

42:44.995 --> 42:46.895
Go. I'll check on Ryland.

42:48.532 --> 42:50.727
He's seizing. He's bradying down.

42:50.901 --> 42:54.997
I need a crash cart and Ativan.
Find Dr. Danoff. Now!

43:02.546 --> 43:05.014
Stay right there, Gary.

43:10.387 --> 43:11.649
Isabelle.

43:11.822 --> 43:14.484
Isabelle. Oh, God!

43:14.658 --> 43:16.182
Somebody call an ambulance!

43:17.695 --> 43:19.060
What's everybody
standing around for?

43:19.229 --> 43:22.528
- Somebody call an ambulance!
- They're on their way.

43:27.004 --> 43:28.699
- Somebody call an ambulance.
- Dad.

43:44.121 --> 43:46.351
What am l?

43:48.092 --> 43:49.616
It's miraculous, Shawn.

43:51.095 --> 43:53.620
When I watch you heal someone,

43:53.797 --> 43:56.789
well, it makes me wonder
why they hate us so much.

43:57.334 --> 43:59.928
They hate us
because you're killing them, Daniel.

44:00.104 --> 44:02.800
They're afraid of us.
I can't blame them.

44:03.707 --> 44:08.076
You make it sound like we acted out
of some sort of blood lust.

44:08.879 --> 44:12.212
These were precise,
tactical strikes, Shawn.

44:12.383 --> 44:14.180
And you and every other 4400

44:14.351 --> 44:16.080
were ultimately much safer
because of them.

44:16.253 --> 44:17.550
You killed people.

44:17.721 --> 44:20.349
That's not what we discussed
when you approached me.

44:20.524 --> 44:22.651
I gave you money to start
a defensive arm for the Center,

44:22.826 --> 44:24.657
in case the government
ever came after us again.

44:24.828 --> 44:25.886
It was a precaution.

44:26.063 --> 44:28.088
And all we've done
is taken precautionary measures.

44:28.265 --> 44:31.098
Shawn, do you think that because
their inhibitor program was exposed,

44:31.268 --> 44:33.862
that the government's just gonna
leave us in peace?

44:34.038 --> 44:36.871
They know we've gotten stronger,
which threatens their hold on power,

44:37.041 --> 44:38.668
which increases their need
to eliminate us.

44:38.842 --> 44:41.072
So we strike first?

44:41.779 --> 44:43.838
Is that it?

44:44.548 --> 44:46.106
Is that what happens on the 1 9th?

44:46.483 --> 44:48.314
Look, Shawn.

44:49.053 --> 44:50.953
You do great work
at that center of yours.

44:51.522 --> 44:53.285
You just focus on that.

44:53.457 --> 44:55.857
I don't wanna distract you.
Knowledge can be a burden.

44:59.129 --> 45:00.926
And thanks for helping T.J. out.

45:01.532 --> 45:03.466
You're a hero to your own people.

45:03.634 --> 45:05.568
Don't forget that.

45:08.872 --> 45:10.339
Yeah.

45:13.744 --> 45:15.371
It did not work, you know.

45:15.546 --> 45:18.777
Ryland was OD'ing,
but the doctors pulled him out of it.

45:18.949 --> 45:20.814
He'll be awake
within a couple of hours.

45:20.984 --> 45:22.952
Well, I'm sure
you're as disappointed as I am.

45:24.154 --> 45:26.088
Don't worry, we'll get him.

45:26.356 --> 45:30.383
Let's talk about Wesley Hauser.
You first met him in quarantine.

45:31.228 --> 45:32.252
I liked Wes.

45:32.429 --> 45:35.489
He was ten kinds of crazy,
but his heart was in the right place.

45:35.666 --> 45:39.033
I guess he was bipolar or something,
but he never took medication.

45:39.203 --> 45:41.398
After quarantine,
he lived on the streets.

45:42.406 --> 45:44.101
I used to visit him
down at the docks.

45:44.274 --> 45:45.969
You know, give him food,
a little money.

45:46.143 --> 45:47.804
So when did you decide to kill him?

45:47.978 --> 45:51.243
Wes, he didn't need
my help with that.

45:51.415 --> 45:53.679
He drank about three bottles
of Mad Dog a day.

45:54.151 --> 45:58.554
One morning, about a month ago,
I went down to see him,

45:59.757 --> 46:02.988
and I found him by the dumpster,
dead.

46:03.160 --> 46:05.151
And somewhere in the middle
of your grieving process,

46:05.329 --> 46:06.660
you figured
he'd make a handy decoy.

46:06.830 --> 46:08.422
No, Hauser wouldn't have minded it.

46:08.599 --> 46:11.693
I mean, he hated people like you
going back to his Marine Corps days.

46:12.069 --> 46:15.971
So when I found him,
I said a word or two over his body.

46:17.674 --> 46:19.335
And I pushed him into Elliot Bay.

46:19.510 --> 46:21.637
So how long you been working
with this Nova Group?

46:21.812 --> 46:23.905
Did someone approach you?
Was the whole thing your idea?

46:24.081 --> 46:27.448
Tell me.
You and this girlfriend of yours.

46:27.618 --> 46:30.519
Is it like a role-playing thing
you get up to,

46:30.687 --> 46:32.382
or is she actually taking you
into these...?

46:33.223 --> 46:35.714
I don't know. What do you call it?
Fantasy worlds?

46:37.494 --> 46:39.189
Oh, and this guy, Marco.

46:40.364 --> 46:43.800
Does he know that you're too

46:43.967 --> 46:47.198
embarrassed to tell your partner
that you two have been dating?

46:48.705 --> 46:50.036
Done showing off?

46:50.974 --> 46:53.738
Why don't you tell us what's
gonna happen on October 1 9th?

46:54.044 --> 46:56.877
I guess you're gonna have
to find yourself another telepath.

47:02.820 --> 47:04.549
Good luck with that.

47:05.422 --> 47:07.822
- So you got nothing out of him?
- He told us about Hauser.

47:07.991 --> 47:10.585
But as far as the Nova goes,
it's gonna take time to break him down.

47:10.761 --> 47:12.422
- How much time?
- He's a telepath.

47:12.596 --> 47:14.689
- He knows what we're thinking.
- Longer than usual.

47:14.865 --> 47:15.923
Okay, so it's not easy.

47:16.099 --> 47:18.897
But Gary Navarro
has a Level 7 security clearance.

47:19.069 --> 47:20.297
We must assume he's been using it

47:20.470 --> 47:22.233
to funnel national secrets
to the Nova Group.

47:22.406 --> 47:24.772
We need to know what he knows.
Now.

47:24.942 --> 47:26.500
He'll talk.

47:26.677 --> 47:28.144
Gary's been inside our heads
for a year.

47:28.312 --> 47:30.177
I think I know
how to get inside of his.

47:34.785 --> 47:37.845
- Careful with this, please.
- Matthew.

47:39.590 --> 47:41.751
I didn't expect to see you back
for a couple weeks.

47:41.925 --> 47:44.689
Nova Group provides
my calendar for me.

47:44.862 --> 47:47.160
Wiped it clean, actually.

47:47.331 --> 47:49.162
It's difficult to lobby
on behalf of the 4400

47:49.333 --> 47:51.494
when some of them are boasting
about their body count.

47:51.668 --> 47:53.135
I suppose.

47:53.303 --> 47:55.396
How's Lily?
Any improvement since I left?

47:55.572 --> 47:59.030
- If anything, she's getting worse.
- Sorry to hear that.

47:59.209 --> 48:00.642
Isabelle?

48:00.811 --> 48:03.439
She tried to kill herself
this morning.

48:04.381 --> 48:06.679
She jumped off the roof.

48:06.850 --> 48:09.751
A few minutes later, she was walking
around like nothing happened.

48:09.920 --> 48:10.909
I gotta tell you, Matthew.

48:11.088 --> 48:14.114
I'm not gonna lie.
I'm really glad you're back.

48:37.147 --> 48:38.910
Hello, lsabelle.

48:40.450 --> 48:42.350
Hello. Who are you?

48:43.387 --> 48:47.289
My name is Matthew Ross.
I work closely with Shawn.

48:47.658 --> 48:51.685
I'm an adviser to the 4400.
May I come in?

49:00.203 --> 49:03.195
I understand
there was an incident this morning.

49:04.041 --> 49:07.169
You attempted to harm yourself.

49:09.780 --> 49:11.407
I see.

49:14.151 --> 49:16.142
You had no right to do that!

49:16.320 --> 49:18.151
Don't you understand who you are?

49:18.322 --> 49:20.483
What you're here to do?

49:20.657 --> 49:22.625
- No.
- Well, I do.

49:22.793 --> 49:24.727
I know everything about you.
I know why you're here,

49:24.895 --> 49:27.056
and I know
what you're supposed to do.

49:28.298 --> 49:29.663
Sit.

49:29.833 --> 49:31.994
And I'll tell you a story.

49:32.970 --> 49:34.335
You'll like it.

49:34.504 --> 49:37.302
It's about your past
and it's about your future.

49:46.650 --> 49:49.016
I know you went
to a lot of trouble to get this.

49:49.186 --> 49:51.051
- Thank you.
- But...?

49:51.221 --> 49:52.779
I'm not sure
I wanna send Maia to a school

49:52.956 --> 49:55.151
that only teaches 4400s.

49:55.325 --> 49:59.455
It sounds like a great way to get her to
withdraw even further from the world.

49:59.629 --> 50:03.895
Just pretend it's got nothing to do
with the 4400 for a second.

50:04.067 --> 50:06.331
It's a good school.
You know, topnotch faculty.

50:06.503 --> 50:09.063
The facilities are great.
And it's all free.

50:09.239 --> 50:11.935
The 4400 Center picks up
the whole tab.

50:12.109 --> 50:14.600
They even have a class
on how to manage your abilities.

50:14.978 --> 50:17.708
Just give me some time
to think about it, okay? It's a big step.

50:19.816 --> 50:21.716
I was kind of hoping
Dr. Burkhoff would have,

50:21.885 --> 50:24.615
I don't know,
a magic pill or something.

50:24.788 --> 50:28.519
What's he working on?
Anything interesting?

50:28.692 --> 50:33.152
You know that promicin serum
that he invented that saved everybody?

50:33.330 --> 50:37.767
Well, I saw a syringe at his place,
and it looked like there was some in it.

50:37.934 --> 50:39.458
Well, he's a researcher, right?

50:39.636 --> 50:42.434
He's probably injecting into, what?
Mice? Guinea pigs?

50:42.606 --> 50:45.234
The only animals I saw at his place
were a couple of cockroaches.

50:45.409 --> 50:48.242
You don't think he's injecting it
into himself, do you?

50:49.046 --> 50:50.479
That's ridiculous.

50:50.647 --> 50:53.548
I am not injecting myself
with the promicin serum.

50:53.717 --> 50:55.947
Good. I'm glad to hear it.

50:56.119 --> 50:57.746
I'm injecting myself

50:57.921 --> 51:01.857
with a modified version
of the promicin serum.

51:02.025 --> 51:04.858
Dr. Burkhoff, I have to ask you this:

51:05.762 --> 51:07.320
Have you stopped taking
your medication?

51:07.497 --> 51:10.830
Of course not.
I'm as sane as you are.

51:12.769 --> 51:15.897
Once the course of treatment
is finished,

51:16.073 --> 51:19.509
I will have taught my body
how to produce promicin.

51:19.676 --> 51:21.906
And then I will be the first

51:22.079 --> 51:25.207
non-returnee
to develop 4400 abilities.

51:25.382 --> 51:27.748
The first of many.

51:27.918 --> 51:31.115
You're talking about the next step
in human evolution.

51:31.288 --> 51:32.846
Do you think
the world's ready for that?

51:33.023 --> 51:35.514
The world is never ready for change.
You have to force it on them.

51:35.692 --> 51:38.593
Isn't that why the 4400
were brought back?

51:38.762 --> 51:41.959
Isn't that why the future
woke me up?

51:43.400 --> 51:47.029
You shouldn't be doing research
of this magnitude

51:47.204 --> 51:49.866
in, excuse me, but-- In a dump.

51:50.040 --> 51:53.009
These are hardly sterile
working conditions.

51:53.176 --> 51:54.666
You could help me with that.

51:54.845 --> 51:56.710
You have a scientific background,
right?

51:56.880 --> 51:59.849
I have graduate degrees
in microbiology and epidemiology.

52:00.016 --> 52:02.985
Good. That'll be handy.

52:03.153 --> 52:06.020
I need someone
to monitor my progress

52:06.189 --> 52:09.317
as the changes continue.

52:10.994 --> 52:12.723
Changes?

52:18.735 --> 52:22.364
I think it's an exciting first step,
don't you?

52:25.542 --> 52:27.476
I was thinking, next time,
we could make a world

52:27.644 --> 52:30.807
where Kyle never shot Jordan Collier,
never went to prison,

52:31.248 --> 52:33.808
the inhibitor scandal
never happened.

52:33.984 --> 52:35.679
Sounds nice.

52:35.852 --> 52:37.444
Although I have to tell you,
at the moment,

52:37.621 --> 52:39.350
I'm not really feeling a need
to be transported

52:39.523 --> 52:41.855
to some kind of fantasy world.

52:42.025 --> 52:43.253
As long as this water stays hot,

52:43.426 --> 52:47.954
things are A-okay with me
right here and now.

52:48.565 --> 52:51.125
Maybe tomorrow we can try it again.

52:51.301 --> 52:52.290
I'll take a rain check.

52:52.469 --> 52:56.997
I'm going to a seminar
at the 4400 Center tomorrow.

52:59.142 --> 53:00.973
It's about what
we can expect physically

53:01.144 --> 53:02.509
now that we're off the inhibitor.

53:02.679 --> 53:05.648
Is everything okay? You're not
having any problems, are you?

53:05.815 --> 53:09.546
No, I feel fine. I feel great, actually.

53:10.854 --> 53:13.721
Well, then I don't get it.
Why do you need to go?

53:13.890 --> 53:17.917
I don't. I wanna go. I'm curious.

53:18.094 --> 53:21.063
But why? You never wanted
to go to the Center before.

53:21.231 --> 53:22.755
Why start now?

53:22.933 --> 53:27.632
I never felt the need
to be around other 4400s before.

53:27.804 --> 53:29.863
Now you do?

53:30.040 --> 53:33.168
It's just a seminar, Thomas.

53:34.311 --> 53:35.642
Yeah, okay.

53:37.214 --> 53:38.738
I get it.

53:46.823 --> 53:48.450
Do you recognize those names?

53:48.892 --> 53:51.759
They're 4400s.
All of them foreign nationals.

53:51.928 --> 53:53.793
Alesandro Ortiz from Venezuela.

53:53.964 --> 53:56.933
Ismael Namir from Libya.
Chitra Singh from lndonesia.

53:57.100 --> 53:58.931
They've all gone missing
in the past year.

53:59.102 --> 54:00.729
That's one year.

54:00.904 --> 54:03.668
That's about as long as you've worked
for the NSA, isn't it, Gary?

54:04.074 --> 54:05.564
We checked your travel records.

54:05.742 --> 54:09.041
You left Venezuela two days
before Ortiz disappeared.

54:09.212 --> 54:12.340
Same thing in Libya, lndonesia.
Everyone on that list.

54:12.515 --> 54:13.914
You were there. They went away.

54:14.084 --> 54:17.576
What exactly did you do
for the NSA, Gary?

54:18.154 --> 54:19.781
There's an arms race going on,
isn't there?

54:19.956 --> 54:21.548
Only now it's with 4400s.

54:21.725 --> 54:24.592
These people, I bet their abilities
make the wrong people very nervous.

54:24.761 --> 54:25.887
And the NSA couldn't stand by

54:26.062 --> 54:30.499
while foreign and potentially
hostile governments developed what?

54:30.667 --> 54:32.635
Human weapons
of mass destruction?

54:33.069 --> 54:34.559
Is this list complete, huh?

54:34.738 --> 54:37.036
Because I'm just wondering
how many 4400s you did kill.

54:37.207 --> 54:40.040
- I did not kill anyone.
- Oh, no, no, no.

54:40.210 --> 54:41.939
You got the right people
in the right ZlP code

54:42.112 --> 54:43.602
because you were living back home.

54:44.581 --> 54:46.105
What did you say? Oh, yeah.

54:46.283 --> 54:49.844
"Very comfortably
when the actual dirty work was done."

54:51.421 --> 54:55.118
And that's why you went across
to the Nova Group, isn't it, Gary?

54:55.292 --> 54:57.624
Because you just couldn't live
with yourself.

54:58.395 --> 55:03.856
The NSA told me
that I was helping my country.

55:07.304 --> 55:09.795
They didn't fill in the blanks.

55:11.174 --> 55:13.233
I had to do that myself.

55:13.576 --> 55:15.100
You felt used.

55:15.278 --> 55:17.212
They made you a weapon
against your own people.

55:17.380 --> 55:19.746
So when did you figure it out?

55:20.417 --> 55:22.408
What's up? Who are these guys?

55:22.585 --> 55:25.315
This is Agent Wood
and Dr. Boll of the NSA.

55:25.488 --> 55:28.685
They've been brought in
to help expedite the interrogation.

55:30.293 --> 55:32.818
First of all, no more sitting.

55:32.996 --> 55:34.224
What's going on here?

55:34.397 --> 55:37.389
- Brought in by whom?
- Gary Navarro tried to kill me.

55:37.567 --> 55:38.829
I made a phone call.

55:39.002 --> 55:40.469
You should be in jail right now,
Dennis.

55:40.637 --> 55:43.834
- I still have a few friends, Tom.
- I had him talking.

55:44.007 --> 55:46.999
- I was making progress.
- Not fast enough.

55:47.177 --> 55:49.907
The members of Gary's cell
know he's been taken.

55:50.080 --> 55:52.571
They're already changing
their plans.

55:52.749 --> 55:56.845
If it takes too long to break him,
the information he gives us is stale.

55:57.020 --> 56:00.217
- October 1 9th is three days away.
- Yeah.

56:00.390 --> 56:03.120
I know you find this
hard to believe, Tom,

56:03.293 --> 56:05.659
but we are on the same side.

56:05.829 --> 56:08.297
We have the same goal.

56:08.465 --> 56:11.161
Those agents are tools.

56:12.001 --> 56:13.593
Use them.

56:23.546 --> 56:26.037
You're sitting in my spot.

56:26.216 --> 56:27.513
Sorry.

56:27.684 --> 56:31.245
It's okay.
There's room for two people to sit.

56:37.727 --> 56:41.686
You've got Stalin, Pol Pot
and the Marquis de Sade?

56:41.865 --> 56:43.093
Did you finish all the fun books?

56:43.833 --> 56:45.801
Well, I'm interested
in learning more about evil.

56:45.969 --> 56:49.496
Everybody's scared of me.
So I thought, what if they're right?

56:50.440 --> 56:53.898
- What if I'm bad?
- Why would you think that?

56:54.744 --> 56:57.508
Sometimes, I think
I feel it inside of me,

56:57.680 --> 56:59.147
Iike, I could be capable of anything.

57:00.216 --> 57:02.776
Everyone's capable of anything.

57:02.952 --> 57:05.011
- Believe me, I know.
- How?

57:05.522 --> 57:08.616
- Have you done bad things?
- Yeah, of course I have.

57:08.792 --> 57:09.986
Will you tell me about them?

57:12.195 --> 57:13.685
Okay.

57:14.864 --> 57:17.833
- I slept with my brother's girlfriend.
- How bad is that?

57:18.001 --> 57:21.027
Some people would call that
a major betrayal.

57:21.204 --> 57:22.466
A lot of hurt feelings.

57:24.040 --> 57:27.908
- This man did much worse than that.
- Well, I'm not a dictator.

57:28.077 --> 57:31.342
But I've done the big kind of bad too.

57:31.514 --> 57:32.503
I can't say much about it,

57:32.682 --> 57:35.344
but I gave some money
to some people.

57:35.518 --> 57:37.679
They used it for something
really, really wrong.

57:37.854 --> 57:40.379
And I don't think
that they're finished.

57:40.824 --> 57:43.190
- Well, can you stop them?
- I could turn them in.

57:43.359 --> 57:45.725
The thing is, so far, they've
only gone after bad people.

57:45.895 --> 57:48.420
- People that tried to kill me.
- Tried to kill all of us.

57:48.598 --> 57:50.327
So if they've only gone
after bad people,

57:50.500 --> 57:54.459
- then doesn't that make them good?
- Maybe.

57:55.071 --> 57:56.732
I don't know.

58:06.850 --> 58:09.375
We're relating now, aren't we?

58:09.552 --> 58:11.179
I read about this.

58:13.223 --> 58:15.817
Yeah, we are.

58:20.196 --> 58:22.061
How was it for you?

58:22.565 --> 58:24.465
I liked it.

58:25.702 --> 58:28.000
We talked.

58:28.171 --> 58:29.661
It helped me understand
good and evil.

58:30.240 --> 58:32.800
According to you, you get to pick.

58:32.976 --> 58:34.170
It's a choice.

58:35.645 --> 58:37.272
I have it right, don't l?

58:41.284 --> 58:42.774
Yeah, you do.

58:50.927 --> 58:52.554
I can't open my hand.

58:52.729 --> 58:56.392
I woke up from a nap,
and it was all bunched up like this.

58:56.566 --> 58:57.863
Arthritis, I can handle.

59:17.153 --> 59:18.142
Feels good.

59:27.764 --> 59:30.562
You're like a human heating pad.

59:32.068 --> 59:33.433
I like that.

59:33.603 --> 59:36.504
Human heating pad.
I'll take it as a compliment.

59:36.673 --> 59:39.164
Seriously, you better?

59:39.342 --> 59:40.775
Yeah.

59:45.582 --> 59:46.606
I've been trading e-mails

59:46.783 --> 59:48.774
with somebody
down at the Mayo Clinic.

59:48.952 --> 59:52.911
He says we should go to Sweden
and try this experimental treatment.

59:53.656 --> 59:55.089
Here.

59:55.825 --> 59:57.258
What's this?

59:57.727 --> 59:59.251
Open it.

01:00:07.403 --> 01:00:10.861
Can you believe that the Air Force
lets you do that now?

01:00:12.275 --> 01:00:15.733
You give them some money,
and they let you ride along in an F-1 6.

01:00:15.912 --> 01:00:17.641
It says here
I get to take the controls.

01:00:17.814 --> 01:00:19.748
I talked to the guy
who was in charge of the program

01:00:19.916 --> 01:00:22.214
and I told him about
your background as a pilot,

01:00:22.385 --> 01:00:26.822
and he said he would let you drive
for 30 seconds.

01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:29.049
Lily, I was a pilot in 1 950.

01:00:29.225 --> 01:00:32.353
That's why it's only 30 seconds.

01:00:33.329 --> 01:00:35.456
Happy birthday, Richard.

01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:37.827
Thanks, but it's not my birthday
for another six weeks.

01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:42.799
Richard, I'm not going to be here
in six weeks.

01:00:44.874 --> 01:00:47.809
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

01:00:47.977 --> 01:00:50.411
You and I have both known
for a while.

01:00:52.015 --> 01:00:53.915
Richard, I'm dying.

01:00:55.151 --> 01:00:56.618
Lily,

01:00:56.786 --> 01:01:00.620
I know how hard this is on you,
but you can't give up.

01:01:00.790 --> 01:01:03.315
Shawn said he's willing to stay
here with you all day if he has to.

01:01:03.926 --> 01:01:06.918
- He'll keep you healthy.
- He can't.

01:01:08.231 --> 01:01:10.028
Not anymore.

01:01:23.179 --> 01:01:25.374
Are all these people 4400s?

01:01:25.548 --> 01:01:28.142
Some are.
Some just wish they were.

01:01:28.317 --> 01:01:30.251
Why would they want that?

01:01:31.654 --> 01:01:33.713
Good morning.
Welcome to the Center.

01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:35.016
Are you a 4400?

01:01:35.792 --> 01:01:38.488
No, sweetie. Are you?

01:01:40.296 --> 01:01:41.923
Well, it is an honor to meet you.

01:01:42.398 --> 01:01:45.526
- Are you here to take our seminar?
- No. We're here to look at the school.

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:47.602
We have an appointment
with Ms. Tobey.

01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:49.567
I'll get her right away.

01:01:49.739 --> 01:01:53.072
In the meantime, would you sign in
and register your ability?

01:01:53.242 --> 01:01:56.075
We're creating a database.

01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:03.380
You sure you wanna do this?

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:06.454
I wanna meet kids like me.

01:02:08.558 --> 01:02:11.527
My name is Alana Mareva.

01:02:11.694 --> 01:02:14.754
I have to admit,

01:02:14.931 --> 01:02:18.423
I was pretty hesitant
about coming here today.

01:02:19.135 --> 01:02:24.402
I was lucky. My life was pretty much
intact when I was returned.

01:02:26.175 --> 01:02:29.508
I never thought much
about being a 4400.

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:33.643
But when we all got sick,

01:02:33.816 --> 01:02:38.150
and seeing everyone together
in quarantine,

01:02:39.555 --> 01:02:43.582
it made me feel like
I had been denying a part of myself.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:47.287
So here I am.

01:02:47.463 --> 01:02:49.454
And I'm glad I came.

01:03:03.312 --> 01:03:05.473
Anything you wanna tell me?

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:12.485
Gary.

01:03:15.358 --> 01:03:17.417
Let's end this.

01:03:18.861 --> 01:03:21.227
I'll let you sit down.

01:03:22.131 --> 01:03:23.894
Who contacted you first?

01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:26.565
Just give me a name.

01:03:28.504 --> 01:03:31.132
Oh, man.

01:03:42.385 --> 01:03:44.046
So how about it?

01:03:45.988 --> 01:03:49.219
October 1 9th is two days away.

01:03:49.625 --> 01:03:52.321
Now, you got something
to tell me or not?

01:03:53.963 --> 01:03:55.863
Suit yourself.

01:04:00.336 --> 01:04:02.167
One of our members
has been compromised.

01:04:02.338 --> 01:04:04.203
I have to assume
he's gonna give up my name.

01:04:04.373 --> 01:04:05.431
What, so you call me?

01:04:05.608 --> 01:04:07.667
For all I know,
NTAC is monitoring this line.

01:04:07.844 --> 01:04:09.368
Well, we're gonna have
to go underground.

01:04:09.545 --> 01:04:10.603
It's gonna cost money.

01:04:11.047 --> 01:04:12.639
You think I'm just gonna write you
a check?

01:04:12.815 --> 01:04:14.248
You can arrange it
however you want.

01:04:14.417 --> 01:04:15.441
I need it tomorrow.

01:04:15.618 --> 01:04:18.416
I will see you at the usual spot,
at the usual time.

01:04:18.788 --> 01:04:22.280
We are in a war,
and we all have to do our part.

01:04:38.374 --> 01:04:41.309
Talk to me, Gary.
What do you got to say, man?

01:04:41.944 --> 01:04:43.639
Talk to me! Talk to me.

01:04:47.450 --> 01:04:49.441
I need names.

01:04:52.521 --> 01:04:54.421
Give me a name!

01:05:01.297 --> 01:05:04.755
- Talk to me, Gary.
- Daniel Armand.

01:05:04.934 --> 01:05:07.095
Daniel Armand.

01:05:08.271 --> 01:05:10.330
Daniel Armand.

01:05:12.141 --> 01:05:14.507
Okay. That's a start.

01:05:15.311 --> 01:05:17.279
- Who else?
- That's it.

01:05:17.446 --> 01:05:19.676
He was my only contact.

01:05:20.316 --> 01:05:24.616
I never met anyone else in the group.
He kept us all separate.

01:05:24.787 --> 01:05:27.449
I'm sorry. I'm just having
a hard time believing that's true.

01:05:27.623 --> 01:05:30.922
His pulse is tachy at 21 0.
Systolic's up to 240.

01:05:31.093 --> 01:05:33.084
- We need to lay off.
- We've only got one name.

01:05:33.262 --> 01:05:34.991
Can't put him under again.
Not for a few hours.

01:05:35.164 --> 01:05:38.998
We haven't got a few hours.
Don't worry. He's my responsibility.

01:05:39.168 --> 01:05:40.760
No. No.

01:05:40.937 --> 01:05:44.498
No, he's not. He's ours.
And he's done for the day.

01:05:53.115 --> 01:05:57.643
Okay, so he's back.
It's not like we weren't expecting this.

01:05:58.421 --> 01:06:00.548
No. Relax.

01:06:00.756 --> 01:06:02.747
He won't get anywhere
near lsabelle.

01:06:02.925 --> 01:06:05.621
We'll find him, and we'll deal with it.

01:06:08.531 --> 01:06:09.691
You made a mistake.

01:06:09.865 --> 01:06:12.993
- You got the wrong person.
- I have to go. I don't think I do.

01:06:13.169 --> 01:06:15.831
Those things you told me,
those things you said I'm going to do.

01:06:16.005 --> 01:06:18.337
That's not me. I have a choice.

01:06:18.541 --> 01:06:19.633
And I don't know who you are,

01:06:19.809 --> 01:06:21.936
and I don't know how you think
you know so much about me,

01:06:22.111 --> 01:06:25.012
- but you're wrong.
- lsabelle,

01:06:25.448 --> 01:06:27.507
I understand
why you're having trouble adjusting.

01:06:28.117 --> 01:06:31.348
Growing up is hard,
but don't be angry at the messenger.

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:32.782
It's not my plan.

01:06:32.955 --> 01:06:38.257
I'm just here to help facilitate,
to help you reach your full potential.

01:06:38.761 --> 01:06:40.695
Think of me as a favorite uncle.

01:06:40.863 --> 01:06:43.195
No. No, I don't have any uncles.

01:06:43.399 --> 01:06:45.924
I don't have any uncles,
and I won't be a part of any plan.

01:06:46.102 --> 01:06:49.663
That's fair enough.
You can always opt out.

01:06:50.606 --> 01:06:53.734
You can even try saving
your mother if you like.

01:06:54.810 --> 01:06:55.799
How?

01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:15.028
- What is that?
- Open it.

01:07:18.901 --> 01:07:21.836
There aren't a lot of things
that'll hurt you, lsabelle.

01:07:22.004 --> 01:07:25.496
But that right there, that'll do the job.

01:07:26.142 --> 01:07:27.871
If you can't accept the fact
that your life

01:07:28.044 --> 01:07:29.944
is vastly more important
than your mother's,

01:07:30.112 --> 01:07:32.603
just give yourself that shot.
You'll be dead in minutes.

01:07:33.949 --> 01:07:35.746
And Lily? Who knows?

01:07:35.918 --> 01:07:39.046
Maybe she'll wake up
and be a young woman again.

01:07:42.024 --> 01:07:47.223
- Will it really save her?
- I don't know. It's a gamble.

01:07:47.396 --> 01:07:51.093
But if you can't live
with who you are, then don't.

01:08:04.346 --> 01:08:06.337
Sorry about that.

01:08:07.483 --> 01:08:09.542
I knew it. I knew it.

01:08:09.785 --> 01:08:12.447
I knew I had a clean cup
somewhere.

01:08:12.621 --> 01:08:15.249
Now, where are the filters?

01:08:15.458 --> 01:08:18.484
- It's okay. I don't need coffee.
- I swear I just saw them.

01:08:18.661 --> 01:08:20.595
Do you mind
if I just use paper towels?

01:08:20.796 --> 01:08:24.357
- Kevin, if I do this...
- If you do it?

01:08:26.902 --> 01:08:28.095
You're already doing it.

01:08:28.871 --> 01:08:29.859
You're here, right?

01:08:30.038 --> 01:08:32.769
If I monitor you
throughout this experiment,

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:34.500
I need you to know one thing.

01:08:35.044 --> 01:08:37.136
If it gets to a point
where your life is in danger,

01:08:37.313 --> 01:08:39.178
I am cutting this off.

01:08:39.348 --> 01:08:41.542
I will not stand by
and watch you die.

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:46.917
Well, I would hope not,
because I'm too valuable.

01:08:48.890 --> 01:08:50.950
I think this is gonna be fun.

01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:55.859
I haven't really worked with anyone
for quite some time.

01:08:56.031 --> 01:08:59.330
- I'm looking forward to it.
- Me too.

01:09:00.402 --> 01:09:01.960
So...

01:09:03.506 --> 01:09:05.531
Wanna draw some blood?

01:09:12.581 --> 01:09:13.741
Nina.

01:09:14.049 --> 01:09:17.212
We were just downstairs. The guard
on duty said Wood signed Gary out.

01:09:17.386 --> 01:09:19.513
Gary was transferred
to an NSA-run facility.

01:09:19.688 --> 01:09:21.484
But he's a 4400.
He's our jurisdiction.

01:09:21.657 --> 01:09:24.057
And someone at the Pentagon
signed an order overriding us.

01:09:24.225 --> 01:09:25.886
Apparently,
they feel we lack experience

01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:27.460
in high-pressure interrogation.

01:09:27.662 --> 01:09:29.654
And who do you think put
that little bug in their ear?

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:32.767
I don't know if it was Ryland or not.
But we had our shot at Navarro.

01:09:32.935 --> 01:09:34.095
Now, tomorrow is October 1 9th.

01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:36.397
We are a day away
from an announced terrorist attack.

01:09:36.572 --> 01:09:39.096
The NSA thinks
they can get him to talk.

01:09:39.274 --> 01:09:42.573
- So where are they taking him?
- They didn't share that information.

01:09:42.745 --> 01:09:45.542
This is so wrong.
This is the only place in the country

01:09:45.714 --> 01:09:48.011
that's at least somewhat equipped
to handle 4400s.

01:09:48.184 --> 01:09:50.413
Do you think
that I didn't tell him that?

01:09:50.586 --> 01:09:52.611
They weren't interested.

01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:09.867
- lsabelle.
- Hi.

01:10:10.039 --> 01:10:12.007
May I come in?

01:10:16.512 --> 01:10:17.774
Are you going somewhere?

01:10:17.947 --> 01:10:20.108
I saw Dad putting luggage
into his car.

01:10:20.282 --> 01:10:24.810
Oh, we're just gonna try another clinic,
but we will be away for a while.

01:10:24.987 --> 01:10:26.921
- Do you want me to come with you?
- No.

01:10:27.089 --> 01:10:29.080
No, it's all right. Thank you.

01:10:29.625 --> 01:10:32.788
Now, if there's anything that you need,
you can talk to Shawn.

01:10:32.962 --> 01:10:33.951
He's...

01:10:34.129 --> 01:10:37.223
He'll be looking out for you, okay?

01:10:39.435 --> 01:10:40.527
And...

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:43.470
I wanna give you this.

01:10:45.808 --> 01:10:49.744
It's my wedding band.
I inherited it from my grandmother.

01:10:50.446 --> 01:10:52.880
Her name was Lily too.

01:10:55.551 --> 01:10:58.645
You used to love to play with it
when you were a little baby.

01:10:59.521 --> 01:11:01.489
I remember.

01:11:02.558 --> 01:11:06.255
- I used to like to bite on it.
- And my finger too.

01:11:07.630 --> 01:11:08.756
You can wear it if you want.

01:11:08.964 --> 01:11:12.627
I always knew
that I would give it to you one day.

01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:18.333
It doesn't fit me anymore,
and I'd hate to lose it.

01:11:19.908 --> 01:11:21.967
I'll keep it safe for you.

01:11:23.812 --> 01:11:25.439
I know you will.

01:11:27.616 --> 01:11:30.847
I'm sorry I have to leave so soon.

01:11:31.387 --> 01:11:33.480
I wish we had more time together.

01:11:34.056 --> 01:11:36.024
Well, when do you think
you'll be back?

01:11:36.191 --> 01:11:37.317
It's hard to say.

01:11:38.594 --> 01:11:40.619
Goodbye, lsabelle.

01:11:48.637 --> 01:11:50.332
Bye.

01:12:16.665 --> 01:12:19.031
Thank you very much.
I'll take her from here.

01:12:19.201 --> 01:12:20.828
Thank you.

01:12:21.603 --> 01:12:22.831
Okay,

01:12:23.405 --> 01:12:26.374
you told her we were going over
to the hospital?

01:12:27.743 --> 01:12:31.235
- How'd it go over?
- Oh, fine.

01:12:31.413 --> 01:12:34.644
I had it easy. I got to lie.

01:12:39.588 --> 01:12:42.648
You're the one
who has to tell her the truth.

01:13:19.928 --> 01:13:21.953
What's going on?

01:13:22.264 --> 01:13:24.198
What's happening?

01:13:40.215 --> 01:13:41.204
We'll get him.

01:13:41.383 --> 01:13:43.647
Funny, that's the exact same thing
Navarro said about you.

01:13:43.819 --> 01:13:44.979
So far, he's wrong.

01:13:45.154 --> 01:13:47.054
He never should've been moved
in the first place.

01:13:47.222 --> 01:13:49.053
- There was no reason.
- There was every reason.

01:13:49.224 --> 01:13:51.692
You're too soft, Tom.
I don't know what's happened to you.

01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:53.589
No, I had him, Dennis! You lost him.

01:13:55.130 --> 01:13:56.256
Sunset's in four hours.

01:13:56.432 --> 01:13:58.400
At this point, we can't even say
with 1 00% certainty

01:13:58.567 --> 01:14:00.159
that it's gonna rise again
in the morning.

01:14:00.335 --> 01:14:01.802
And the one guy
who can tell us is gone.

01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:04.837
That's a defeatist attitude.
We'll get him.

01:14:05.307 --> 01:14:08.640
Yeah, I know. You keep saying that.

01:14:19.922 --> 01:14:21.355
Hey, Shawn.

01:14:21.523 --> 01:14:23.684
- You got something for me?
- Where's Daniel?

01:14:24.259 --> 01:14:25.385
Busy. He sent me.

01:14:27.162 --> 01:14:29.960
- No, no, no. That's not how we work.
- Today it is.

01:14:31.133 --> 01:14:32.293
You can trust me.

01:14:32.468 --> 01:14:36.404
You saved my life. I owe you.

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:41.075
Come on. Let's get this over with.
I feel a little naked standing out here.

01:14:45.981 --> 01:14:47.710
Thanks.

01:14:48.984 --> 01:14:51.578
Listen,
if there's ever anything you need--

01:14:57.392 --> 01:14:59.383
You sold us--

01:15:05.701 --> 01:15:06.725
Get in there, get in there.

01:15:11.573 --> 01:15:14.167
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:15:14.877 --> 01:15:16.970
I don't guess we'll be seeing her
in court anytime soon.

01:15:17.145 --> 01:15:19.306
No, you did the right thing
by calling us, Shawn.

01:15:19.481 --> 01:15:20.607
Seriously.

01:15:21.049 --> 01:15:22.949
You're a hero.

01:15:45.841 --> 01:15:47.809
One minute to go.

01:15:49.111 --> 01:15:52.740
Just tell me one thing.
Are we as prepared as we can be?

01:15:52.915 --> 01:15:54.883
The entire country's
on level-red terror alert.

01:15:55.050 --> 01:15:57.883
All commercial air traffic
has been suspended for the day.

01:15:58.053 --> 01:16:01.022
The National Guard
has been deployed to likely targets.

01:16:01.323 --> 01:16:03.553
"Likely targets." Kind of a broad term.

01:16:03.725 --> 01:16:05.556
I wish T.J. could've narrowed
that down for us.

01:16:05.727 --> 01:16:09.686
Well, me too. But we have to keep her
sedated to inhibit her ability.

01:16:09.865 --> 01:16:13.323
She's already turned this place
into a war zone once.

01:16:14.336 --> 01:16:16.429
So now we wait.

01:16:17.139 --> 01:16:20.802
Anyone else feel like they're staring
at a doomsday clock?

01:16:33.555 --> 01:16:35.250
Well, that's it.

01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:37.517
October 1 9th.

01:16:39.127 --> 01:16:41.618
Looks like the world's still here.

01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:44.025
For the moment, anyway.

01:17:01.149 --> 01:17:03.083
Oh, my God!

01:17:06.088 --> 01:17:09.182
- What? What happened?
- It's the Nova Group.

01:17:09.358 --> 01:17:11.121
Certainly, "miracle"
is an imprecise term,

01:17:11.293 --> 01:17:13.261
but I'm not sure how else
to describe it.

01:17:13.428 --> 01:17:14.417
To repeat:

01:17:14.596 --> 01:17:17.224
I'm broadcasting live from
the Nubian Desert, north of Khartoum,

01:17:17.399 --> 01:17:20.891
where overnight,
a thousand-acre patch of barren sand

01:17:21.069 --> 01:17:24.300
has somehow been transformed
into fertile wheat fields.

01:17:24.473 --> 01:17:27.067
Scientists are at a loss
to explain the conversion,

01:17:27.242 --> 01:17:30.268
but tests confirm that the wheat
is real and edible.

01:17:30.479 --> 01:17:32.572
There hasn't been food growing
in that part of the world

01:17:32.748 --> 01:17:34.443
since before the birth of Christ.

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:36.811
They make us all terrified,

01:17:36.985 --> 01:17:40.148
and then rather than attacking us,
they give us a gift.

01:17:40.322 --> 01:17:42.722
Our station
has just received a statement

01:17:42.891 --> 01:17:46.554
from the radical 4400 organization
known as the Nova Group,

01:17:46.728 --> 01:17:50.357
claiming responsibility
for this morning's transformation.

01:17:50.532 --> 01:17:53.000
You are witnesses to the beginning
of a new era.

01:17:53.168 --> 01:17:55.033
What happens next is up to you.

01:17:55.203 --> 01:17:58.730
The 4400 can be mankind's
greatest ally,

01:17:58.907 --> 01:18:01.341
or its most dangerous adversary.

01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:05.207
Don't kid yourself. It's an attack.
An act of aggression, anyway.

01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:07.575
They just showed everyone
that they can change the world,

01:18:07.749 --> 01:18:10.240
and there's not a damn thing
we can do about it.

01:18:33.008 --> 01:18:36.603
- Hello?
- I'm very disappointed in you, Shawn.

01:18:36.778 --> 01:18:40.270
- Daniel.
- I realize you're still a young man.

01:18:40.816 --> 01:18:43.683
But I'm afraid I can't forgive you.

01:19:07.476 --> 01:19:11.310
Keith, I'm broadcasting live
from the Nubian Desert...

01:19:53.388 --> 01:19:55.879
It's okay, Kyle. Daddy's...

01:19:56.057 --> 01:19:59.493
Daddy's here. I'm right here.

01:19:59.928 --> 01:20:01.919
I'm right here.

01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:04.622
Just go to sleep.

01:20:52.581 --> 01:20:54.344
Hey, I'm Tyler.

01:20:54.850 --> 01:20:56.283
Maia.

01:21:34.556 --> 01:21:35.648
Lily.

01:21:39.094 --> 01:21:40.994
We are here.

01:21:44.766 --> 01:21:48.702
- Hasn't changed much, has it?
- No.

01:21:50.138 --> 01:21:52.231
We were so happy here.

01:21:52.407 --> 01:21:55.035
Just you and me, and the baby.

01:21:55.443 --> 01:21:57.638
It was so much simpler.

01:21:58.914 --> 01:22:03.783
- Would you like to head on inside?
- No, not just yet.

01:22:04.753 --> 01:22:07.620
No, let's stay out here for a while.

01:22:07.789 --> 01:22:09.950
It's so peaceful.

01:22:31.346 --> 01:22:32.938
Remember when you went
into labor?

01:22:33.348 --> 01:22:35.612
I could hardly get the car into gear.

01:22:41.356 --> 01:22:43.790
But you gave me directions
to the hospital.

01:22:43.959 --> 01:22:45.551
How did you stay so calm?

01:22:49.464 --> 01:22:50.988
Lily?

01:22:51.305 --> 01:22:57.196
