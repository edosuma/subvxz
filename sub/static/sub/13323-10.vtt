Well, I'm actually getting

00:10.444 --> 00:13.114
back into the photography thing,

00:13.147 --> 00:15.049
so I hope you'll
keep me in mind

00:15.083 --> 00:17.218
for any work that comes up.

00:17.251 --> 00:18.219
- But your work was safe.

00:18.252 --> 00:19.220
It had no teeth...

00:19.253 --> 00:20.488
or balls, really.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.523
- Awesome, George.

Hello, bellman.

your doorman shots?

00:26.460 --> 00:27.761
- Yeah, why?
You knew they were nude.

00:29.097 --> 00:30.498
- Graham is here.

00:30.531 --> 00:31.499
- Graham had his
chance with you,

00:31.532 --> 00:33.101
and he blew it.

00:33.134 --> 00:34.568
Don't let him
suck you back in.

00:34.602 --> 00:37.338

Brooke von Weber,

00:56.690 --> 00:58.359
will you be my re-bride?

01:00.894 --> 01:02.863
Yes!
The answer is yes.

like somebody

01:13.607 --> 01:15.309
bought a photo
from my website!

01:15.343 --> 01:17.611
- Hey, that's terrific,
honey.

01:17.645 --> 01:20.581
Kids, Mommy sold a photo!

01:20.614 --> 01:22.183
- Is this
really happening?

01:22.216 --> 01:24.818
A total stranger
bought one of my photos!

01:24.852 --> 01:26.787
- What happened?
- Kids, listen up.

01:26.820 --> 01:28.822
I was about to
bail on myself

01:28.856 --> 01:30.491
after tons of rejection,

01:30.524 --> 01:32.393
and this is living proof

01:32.426 --> 01:35.463
that if you work hard enough
and you're patient,

01:35.496 --> 01:37.365
eventually it will pay off!

01:37.398 --> 01:39.700
[kids cheer]

01:39.733 --> 01:42.203

Grisly, grisly breath.

Go brush your teeth, okay?

01:45.406 --> 01:46.674
Trixie can suck it.

01:46.707 --> 01:47.841
There's somebody out there

01:47.875 --> 01:49.643
who thinks my work
does have balls.

01:49.677 --> 01:51.312
- See, all you needed
was a little encouragement.

01:51.345 --> 01:52.713
Honey, you are an artist.

01:54.648 --> 01:55.816
- Yeah.

01:55.849 --> 01:57.751
- [chuckles]
- Wait.

01:57.785 --> 01:58.786
- What?

01:58.819 --> 02:00.588
- Oh, my god.

02:00.621 --> 02:03.056
It was you.

02:03.090 --> 02:03.991
You bought it!

02:04.024 --> 02:05.058
Oh my God.

02:05.092 --> 02:06.494
It was a pity-buy?

02:06.527 --> 02:08.396
- No, I-- I just--
- Kids!

02:08.429 --> 02:10.798
Forget everything
I just said.

02:10.831 --> 02:12.466
- I liked the photo, honey.

02:12.500 --> 02:13.467
You just needed
a little boost.

02:13.501 --> 02:14.668
- No.

02:14.702 --> 02:16.570
That is a false
sense of confidence.

02:16.604 --> 02:17.571
Like water-wings.

02:17.605 --> 02:18.839
- Oh, stop.

02:18.872 --> 02:20.841
- I'm Jennifer Beals
in "Flashdance"

02:20.874 --> 02:22.543
when Michael Nouri
got her the audition

02:22.576 --> 02:23.944
she thought she'd earned.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.579

that audition!

She was awesome!

Vaness.

02:37.090 --> 02:38.559
And you're my plug-puller.

02:38.592 --> 02:40.361
Can we just call time of death?

02:40.394 --> 02:41.395
- Not yet.

02:41.429 --> 02:42.930
I still see vital signs.

02:42.963 --> 02:45.333
- So Graham is
leaving tomorrow.

02:45.366 --> 02:46.534
Have you guys had a talk?

02:46.567 --> 02:48.336
Are you gonna
see other people?

02:48.369 --> 02:50.070
- You don't have a talk when
you're just having fun.

02:50.103 --> 02:51.839
That's the opposite of fun.

02:51.872 --> 02:53.607
Pass the hot sauce.

02:54.742 --> 02:56.009
What?

02:56.043 --> 02:58.512
- Okay, well, you're not
gonna like it,

02:58.546 --> 03:00.514
but I'm tired
of guys like Graham

03:00.548 --> 03:03.551
parking in your husband
parking spot just for "fun."

03:03.584 --> 03:04.918
- [laughs]

03:04.952 --> 03:07.688
Jill, I'm never
getting married again.

03:07.721 --> 03:09.823
There is no husband
parking spot.

03:09.857 --> 03:10.991
- I don't believe you.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.426
I think you're ready
for love--

03:12.460 --> 03:13.694
maybe even with Graham--

03:13.727 --> 03:15.263
but you're just too cool
to admit it.

03:15.263 --> 03:16.597
- Listen to me:

03:16.630 --> 03:18.766
I am happy with
my love life.

03:18.799 --> 03:21.034
You're the one who's unhappy
with my love life,

03:21.068 --> 03:23.537
so that's your cross to bear.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.773
Or whatever the Jewish
equivalent is.

03:25.806 --> 03:27.140

Just have mercy on me,
I have to get it up

03:28.976 --> 03:31.879

"vows renewal."

03:31.912 --> 03:34.482

"rediscovered love."

What happened to
the guava gown I picked out?

04:19.159 --> 04:20.728
- Well, it's funny:

04:20.761 --> 04:22.896
I must have lost a few pounds
on my cleanse,

04:22.930 --> 04:24.665
because it was literally
falling off of me.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.834
And I just thought that this
would be more festive.

04:26.867 --> 04:29.770
But you know, it's still
a little big.

04:29.803 --> 04:31.572

After a very challenging time,
I have it all:

a booming company,
several fabulous homes,

04:50.858 --> 04:52.993
a husband who loves me
so much

04:53.026 --> 04:54.928
he wants to marry me
a second time--

04:54.962 --> 04:56.364
- Four healthy kids...

04:56.397 --> 04:58.265

And I couldn't have arrived
at this moment without...

my chompers.

- Well, of course.
- What can I say?

08:16.196 --> 08:17.698
We made some good returns
that summer.

08:17.731 --> 08:20.467
- Ooh!
- Mr. Manassian.

08:20.568 --> 08:22.169
So good of you to be here.

08:22.202 --> 08:24.404
The artwork in my wife's office
looks phenomenal.

08:24.437 --> 08:25.472
- Well, she's got
a great eye.

08:25.573 --> 08:26.774
Makes my job easy.

08:26.807 --> 08:28.341
- And I see
you met Mr. Ernie Krevitt,

08:28.375 --> 08:30.778
genius investor?
He's like a father to me.

08:30.811 --> 08:33.113
- [whispers] Guess that means
we're married.

08:33.146 --> 08:36.083
We'd better be careful.
I'm very fertile.

08:36.116 --> 08:37.417
- Good to know!

08:37.450 --> 08:39.086
- Nice to see you.

08:39.119 --> 08:41.188
- Oh, hi.

08:41.221 --> 08:45.425
- Oh, excuse me--
I think you dropped this.

08:45.458 --> 08:48.461
- That's it!

08:48.495 --> 08:50.864
Now I remember
where I know you from!

08:50.898 --> 08:52.766
- I really don't know
what you're referring to.

08:52.800 --> 08:56.103
- Um, oops!

08:56.136 --> 08:57.437
Does that jog your memory?

08:57.470 --> 08:59.673
- No, I don't know
what you mean.

08:59.707 --> 09:01.609
- Oh, really?

09:01.609 --> 09:02.776
Nothing?

09:02.810 --> 09:05.445
Hmm?
How 'bout now?

09:05.478 --> 09:06.479
- Ugh!

09:06.513 --> 09:07.748
- [laughing]

09:07.781 --> 09:10.517
I knew I hated you
from somewhere!

09:10.618 --> 09:11.852
You're the one
who called me a Nazi

09:11.885 --> 09:12.853
on the Montauk Highway.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.287
- Because you were littering

09:14.321 --> 09:15.488
and I was trying
to protect the Earth.

09:15.522 --> 09:17.257
What is wrong with you?

09:17.290 --> 09:18.859
Aren't you supposed
to be the Queen of Happiness?

09:18.892 --> 09:21.361
- Oh, I'm very happy
right now.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.764
I'm enjoying this delightful
little coincidence.

09:23.797 --> 09:24.865
Sir!

09:24.898 --> 09:26.700
Thank you.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.268
- Don't you think
you should wait

09:28.301 --> 09:29.336
till after you're done
officiating

09:29.369 --> 09:30.704
to get shitfaced?

09:30.738 --> 09:34.507
- Oh, you're also
on booze patrol now?

09:34.541 --> 09:36.209
I think I can handle this:

09:36.243 --> 09:38.411
Brooke,
do you renew your vow

09:38.445 --> 09:40.547
to cherish Lex
till death do you part?

09:40.648 --> 09:42.816
Lex, do you promise not to
bang any more secretaries?

09:42.850 --> 09:44.217
- Hey!

09:44.251 --> 09:45.518
Don't trash my family.

09:45.552 --> 09:47.688
That's my thing.
- Oh, please.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.489
Everyone knows
what "vows renewal" means.

09:49.522 --> 09:51.391
- Yeah, no shit.
Someone boned.

09:51.424 --> 09:52.492
But people can change.

09:52.525 --> 09:53.861
- [scoffs]
Yeah, right.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.663
And my ex-husband
isn't going down dog

09:55.696 --> 09:57.497
on my old yoga instructor
right now.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.733
My next book's
gonna be called,

09:59.767 --> 10:02.335
"Rich Men Who Cheat
and the Women

10:02.369 --> 10:04.237
Who Don't Want to Downsize."

10:04.271 --> 10:05.438
- Ms. Green?

10:05.472 --> 10:06.907
I'm sorry to interrupt, but

10:06.940 --> 10:08.742
your book changed my life.

10:08.776 --> 10:09.743
- Mine, too!

10:09.777 --> 10:12.445
- Oh.
Namaste.

10:12.479 --> 10:13.914
Of course.
Namaste.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.916
- Namaste away
from me.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.384
- So are you going to
be attending

10:17.417 --> 10:18.786
my reading at the 92nd Street Y?

10:18.819 --> 10:19.787
- I wouldn't miss it.

10:19.820 --> 10:20.854
- Oh.

10:20.888 --> 10:22.589
You have the glow
of happiness.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.761
- Brooke?
Hi. Sorry.

10:27.795 --> 10:30.263
So, um...
[sighs]

10:30.297 --> 10:31.732
Given our history,

10:31.765 --> 10:35.002
I feel like I should
share some information with you

10:35.035 --> 10:36.569
that could be upsetting.

10:36.603 --> 10:37.838
Will be upsetting.

10:37.871 --> 10:38.972
- We're T-minus ten.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.273
Can't it wait?

10:40.307 --> 10:41.374
- No.

10:41.408 --> 10:44.277
Um...

10:44.311 --> 10:45.813
I know you idolize Joy,

10:45.846 --> 10:47.681
but she is a fraud

10:47.715 --> 10:49.683
and does not
have your back.

10:49.717 --> 10:53.386
- Jill, I can't take in
this negativity right now.

10:53.420 --> 10:54.755
As Joy says,

10:54.788 --> 10:57.057
"There are radiators
and there are drains."

10:57.090 --> 10:59.893
And I need to surround myself
with radiators

10:59.927 --> 11:02.529
before I remarry
the man I love.

11:02.562 --> 11:04.031
- Yeah, I just don't think
you realized--

11:04.064 --> 11:05.966
- Who's ready
to get married again?

11:05.999 --> 11:08.869
- Joy, perfect timing.

11:08.902 --> 11:11.471
I was actually just going over
the final script,

11:11.504 --> 11:14.441
and there's one paragraph
I think we can do without.

11:14.474 --> 11:15.442
- Oh, really?

11:15.475 --> 11:16.744
- Yes, it's a small one,

11:16.744 --> 11:18.445
about your trip to Yemen?

11:18.478 --> 11:20.480
Lovely story.
It brought me to tears.

11:20.513 --> 11:23.650
I just don't think it's germane
to this particular occasion.

11:23.751 --> 11:25.485
- Well, that's surprising.

11:25.518 --> 11:29.757
Because it is the centerpiece
of chapter 14,

11:29.757 --> 11:31.558
"Sticking to it
When You're Most Stuck,"

11:31.591 --> 11:34.427
which you quoted at length
in your TED talk.

11:34.461 --> 11:35.796
- Of course.

11:35.829 --> 11:39.767
But today is really more about
chapter 17,

11:39.800 --> 11:40.901
"Seeing Past Rage

11:40.934 --> 11:43.070
and Finding Love
and Acceptance."

11:43.103 --> 11:44.905
- That's funny, because
I thought

11:44.938 --> 11:47.440
that I was the architect
of my own work

11:47.474 --> 11:49.076
and that's why you hired me.

11:49.109 --> 11:51.912
- Yes, but I assumed
when you accepted the job,

11:51.945 --> 11:54.414
you did so
in a collaborative spirit.

11:54.447 --> 11:55.816
chapter 7,

11:55.849 --> 11:58.819
"Bettering Yourself by
Taking the Best from Others."

11:58.852 --> 12:00.821
- You seem to be forgetting
chapter 22,

12:00.854 --> 12:04.191
"If You're Talking,
You're Not Learning," so...

12:04.224 --> 12:07.527
are you ready to embrace
Joy Green or not?

12:07.560 --> 12:08.996
- Joy,

12:09.029 --> 12:12.499
this entire conversation
is...surprising

12:12.532 --> 12:13.934
and frankly...

12:13.967 --> 12:15.668
unacceptable.

12:15.702 --> 12:17.971
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave right now.

12:18.005 --> 12:20.007
- Your deposit
is non-refundable.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.674
- Devon, please
call security.

12:21.708 --> 12:22.910
- On it!

12:22.943 --> 12:25.278
- I'm quite fine
exiting on my own.

12:25.312 --> 12:26.579
Chapter 29,

12:26.613 --> 12:27.680
"Know How to Mic-Drop

12:27.714 --> 12:29.883
Out of a Toxic-Situation."

12:37.891 --> 12:38.358
- Brooke, I'm so sorry.

12:39.827 --> 12:41.628
- Guys, what's the hold-up?

12:41.661 --> 12:42.996
People are getting restless.

12:43.030 --> 12:44.865
- Oh, Lex,
it'll break your heart

12:44.898 --> 12:46.133
just like it broke mine.

12:46.166 --> 12:47.300
- What?

12:47.334 --> 12:49.102
- Brooke shit-canned
Joy Green.

12:49.136 --> 12:50.838
She's a lying, seething,

12:50.838 --> 12:54.541
vile, disgusting,
horrible psychopath.

12:54.574 --> 12:55.843
And a litterbug.

12:55.876 --> 12:58.545
- There's a special place
in hell

12:58.578 --> 12:59.847
for litterbugs.

12:59.847 --> 13:03.283
- Lex, we have no one
to officiate!

13:04.317 --> 13:05.853
- What about Jilly-beans?

13:07.855 --> 13:09.622
- Brooke and Lex,

13:09.656 --> 13:13.126
you have chosen to
weave a tapestry of traditions

13:13.160 --> 13:15.728
from around the globe
for this renewal.

13:15.762 --> 13:17.630
We're here
because we acknowledge

13:17.664 --> 13:20.200
our foibles, our weaknesses.

13:20.233 --> 13:22.870
Coming out this fall
in paperback,

13:22.870 --> 13:24.304
look for the "Joy Manifesto"--

13:24.337 --> 13:25.873
Oops.
Sorry!

13:25.873 --> 13:27.274
[hums]
Where are we?

13:27.307 --> 13:29.242
And...
[clicks tongue]

13:29.276 --> 13:34.047
And join us now as we begin
our spiritual journey

13:34.081 --> 13:37.017
around the world.

13:37.050 --> 13:38.952
From the Chinese tradition,

13:38.986 --> 13:40.787
the tea ceremony...

13:40.888 --> 13:44.191
[gong crashes loudly]

13:45.258 --> 13:46.994
- From the Hindu tradition,

13:47.027 --> 13:51.198
the placement of the "Thali"
around the bride's neck.

13:51.231 --> 13:53.666
* Hey, dilly da

13:53.700 --> 13:55.903
* Simmy, simmy, simmy wah

13:55.936 --> 13:57.304
[roars]

13:57.337 --> 14:03.911
[chanting in Latin]

14:03.944 --> 14:07.915
The Haka war dance is used
to show victory in love

14:07.915 --> 14:10.250
and also as a pre-game ritual

14:10.283 --> 14:12.819
for the Dartmouth
La Crosse team.

14:13.921 --> 14:16.924
- [screaming and stomping]

14:23.363 --> 14:25.765
In sickness and in health...

14:25.798 --> 14:27.935
- For richer, for poorer...

14:27.968 --> 14:30.370
Both: Till death do we part.

14:30.403 --> 14:32.973
- Borrowing from
the Bhutanese tradition,

14:33.006 --> 14:35.808
Brooke and Lex will
bind themselves to each other

14:35.842 --> 14:37.945
through the windows
of their souls

14:37.978 --> 14:41.848
by staring into each other's
eyes in silence for...

14:41.949 --> 14:44.017
for 30 minutes?

14:44.051 --> 14:45.953
[all gasp, groan]
- [quietly] Oh, shit.

14:51.024 --> 14:52.425
- [sighs]

14:52.459 --> 14:53.961
- [whispers]
Devon.

14:53.961 --> 14:55.162
Can I get
a shot of espresso?

14:55.195 --> 14:56.229
A double shot?

15:01.201 --> 15:03.003
[bones cracking]

15:06.306 --> 15:07.340
[grunts]

15:09.276 --> 15:11.478
[stomach growls]

15:13.080 --> 15:16.984
[cell phone buzzing]

15:16.984 --> 15:18.551
Sorry.
I'm just gonna...

15:18.585 --> 15:21.354
Excuse me one sec.
Just keep staring.

15:21.388 --> 15:23.223
Hi.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.291
Talk fast, I'm officiating.

15:24.324 --> 15:25.358
- I'm mad at you.

15:25.392 --> 15:26.994
- Me?
What'd I do?

15:26.994 --> 15:28.561
- Everything was fine,
and now Graham is gone,

15:28.595 --> 15:30.230
and I'm sad,
and it's all your fault.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.665
- What?
Wait, you're sad he's gone?

15:32.699 --> 15:34.101
But that's a good thing.

15:34.134 --> 15:36.236
- No, it's not.
It--

15:36.269 --> 15:37.904
There's crumbs everywhere.

15:38.005 --> 15:39.339
Is this a cherry pit?

15:39.372 --> 15:42.075
He is so thoughtless
and selfish,

15:42.109 --> 15:43.110
and now I miss him.

15:43.143 --> 15:44.444
You!

15:44.477 --> 15:46.313
You put me in this situation.
- Me?

15:46.346 --> 15:48.315
I'm the one who told you
not to see him

15:48.348 --> 15:50.083
the minute
I heard he was in town!

15:50.117 --> 15:52.019
- But you knew I would get
sucked back in!

15:52.019 --> 15:54.354
You should've tried harder
to prevent this from happening.

15:54.387 --> 15:57.257
- Okay, I am not gonna try
to defend myself,

15:57.290 --> 15:59.426
because you sound like
an escapee

15:59.459 --> 16:01.428
from a mental asylum.

16:01.461 --> 16:02.729
Now, stop blaming me

16:02.762 --> 16:04.097
and tell him how you feel.

16:04.131 --> 16:05.598
- He's gone.
Off to Laos.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.667
- Well, what time's his flight?

16:07.700 --> 16:09.269
Put down the remote
and focus!

16:09.302 --> 16:10.670
- [sighs]

16:10.703 --> 16:12.172
I'm not going to the airport.

16:12.205 --> 16:13.773
I already washed my face.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.109
I'm in my sweat pants.
I just needed to yell at you.

16:16.143 --> 16:18.045
How's the party?
- So that's it?

16:18.045 --> 16:19.546
You're just gonna watch TV

16:19.579 --> 16:22.249
while Graham waltzes off
and gets scooped up

16:22.282 --> 16:25.585
by some sexy, do-goody field
worker in the rice paddies?

16:25.618 --> 16:27.054
[timer beeps]

16:27.054 --> 16:29.122
I gotta go.
Time's almost up.

16:29.156 --> 16:30.390
- [sighs]

16:32.092 --> 16:33.493
- And that's 30.

16:33.526 --> 16:36.363
Good Morning, Vietnam!

16:36.396 --> 16:38.331
Okay, homestretch, people.

16:38.365 --> 16:41.368
If you will all open the boxes
under your seats,

16:41.401 --> 16:45.138
for the release of the
Purple Emperor butterflies,

16:45.172 --> 16:48.808
a symbol of metamorphosis
and freedom...

16:48.841 --> 16:50.243
Release.

16:50.277 --> 16:54.147
[audience murmuring
indistinctly]

16:54.181 --> 16:55.482
Release.

16:55.515 --> 16:59.386
- [whispers] They're dead.

16:59.419 --> 17:01.754
- Life is short,
carpe diem.

17:04.791 --> 17:05.125
[swanky music]

17:08.161 --> 17:09.662
- Very nice service.

17:09.696 --> 17:11.464
- [laughs]
Thanks.

17:11.498 --> 17:13.466
A sister-in-law's work
is never done.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.602
- Oh, you must be
the photographer.

17:15.635 --> 17:17.237
I like your work.

17:17.270 --> 17:18.805
- Oh, no, I think you're
thinking of someone else.

17:18.838 --> 17:20.640
- No, no, you shot
the doorman, right?

17:20.673 --> 17:23.310
In various states
of undress?

17:23.343 --> 17:25.745
My own doormen
was very proud of his.

17:25.778 --> 17:27.280
- [laughs]
Oh, my god, yes.

17:27.314 --> 17:29.282
That's me.
- Where do you show?

17:29.316 --> 17:32.552
- [laughs]
Uh, on my laptop, mostly.

17:32.585 --> 17:35.155
You made my night!
Thank you.

17:35.188 --> 17:36.523
What do you do?

17:36.556 --> 17:38.725
- Oh, I have a small
gallery in Chelsea.

17:38.758 --> 17:41.428
In fact, I'm gonna do
a group show

17:41.461 --> 17:43.463
on men in uniform
in the fall.

17:43.496 --> 17:45.898
It's mostly military
and law enforcement,

17:45.932 --> 17:49.269
but your doormen
would give it a nice twist.

17:49.302 --> 17:51.671
I'd love to include you,
if you're interested.

17:51.704 --> 17:55.175
- [laughs] Thank you.
- Call me. We'll talk.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.344
- Jill.
- Yeah?

17:57.377 --> 17:59.412
- Do you realize
who you were speaking with?

17:59.446 --> 18:00.613
- Yes, this nice guy.

18:00.647 --> 18:02.915
He says he has a gallery
in Chelsea.

18:02.949 --> 18:04.251
Larry Manassian?

18:04.284 --> 18:05.418
[gasps]

18:05.452 --> 18:07.687
That's Larry Manassian?

18:07.720 --> 18:10.022
- I just hope
you didn't say anything

18:10.056 --> 18:11.591
to him to embarrass me.

18:11.624 --> 18:13.960
He lives in my building.

18:13.993 --> 18:16.563
- Oh, my god.
Andy! Andy!

18:20.300 --> 18:22.635
- What are you--
- Sorry, I forgot my phone.

18:22.669 --> 18:23.936
Such an idiot.

18:23.970 --> 18:25.538
And the car's waiting
outside.

18:25.572 --> 18:27.274
Where--I thought
I left it in the kitchen.

18:27.307 --> 18:29.942
[both groan]

18:29.976 --> 18:31.711
Over here with my bag.

18:31.744 --> 18:32.745
I was packing my bag.

18:32.779 --> 18:33.813
Where the hell is it?

18:33.846 --> 18:35.448
Ah!
Found it!

18:35.482 --> 18:37.817
Okay.

18:37.850 --> 18:39.586
Wait, what--are you--
are you okay?

18:39.619 --> 18:42.555
- [groans]
- Holy shit, what is happening?

18:42.589 --> 18:44.724
- This really sucks.
God damn it!

18:44.757 --> 18:47.860
I know you have
a plane to catch,

18:47.894 --> 18:49.962
and this is not
an ultimatum.

18:49.996 --> 18:52.565
I just have to get this
stupid thing off my chest,

18:52.599 --> 18:54.734
and then you can go.

18:54.767 --> 18:57.804
I wish you would stay.

18:57.837 --> 19:00.540
There, I said it.
Are you happy now?

19:01.774 --> 19:04.444
- I am.

19:04.477 --> 19:05.545
Very.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.619
- You better go;
your car's waiting.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.454
- Are you sure?
Is this a test?

19:14.487 --> 19:15.755
- No.
No.

19:15.788 --> 19:17.990
I just wanted you to know
how I feel.

19:18.024 --> 19:19.492
We'll figure
the rest out later.

19:19.526 --> 19:20.660
Now leave.

19:24.096 --> 19:25.632
Seriously.

19:25.665 --> 19:26.766
- You're very weird.

19:34.941 --> 19:36.843
- I can't believe
Larry Manassian

19:36.876 --> 19:38.611
wants to put me
in a group show!

19:38.645 --> 19:39.846
Was that a dream?

19:39.879 --> 19:41.113
- Never doubted you, honey.

19:41.147 --> 19:43.583
I knew it was
just a matter of time.

19:43.616 --> 19:46.853
This is turning into
quite the day.

19:46.886 --> 19:48.955
- Hey, what's--
what's going on?

19:48.988 --> 19:50.557
- All right.

19:50.590 --> 19:51.824
I don't know, but that's
Ernie Krevitt,

19:51.858 --> 19:52.892
Mom's money-guy...

19:52.925 --> 19:54.527
And Lex's.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.095
- How embarrassing.

19:56.128 --> 19:57.830
I wonder what he did.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.165
- Devon!
What's happening?

19:59.266 --> 20:00.933
- They're saying
he pulled a Madoff!

20:00.967 --> 20:02.769
[all gasping]
Yeah. Yeah.

20:02.802 --> 20:04.170
Brooke just got me
in with him.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.938
Where is Brooke?

20:05.972 --> 20:07.073
Brooke?

20:07.106 --> 20:08.541
- This can't be happening.

20:08.575 --> 20:10.076
We moved all our money
over to him.

20:10.109 --> 20:11.077
Sebastian!

20:11.110 --> 20:12.144
- Us too.

20:12.178 --> 20:13.212
Jared?

20:13.246 --> 20:15.448
I don't look good in poor, Jill!

20:15.482 --> 20:17.850
[voices overlapping]

20:17.884 --> 20:19.986
- Dude,
of course I went all in.

20:20.019 --> 20:21.821
Ernie was our
best performing manager.

20:21.854 --> 20:23.122
He was killing it for us.

20:23.155 --> 20:24.056
You would've done
the same thing!

20:24.090 --> 20:25.958
- But--but--no, but

20:25.992 --> 20:28.961
we're gonna be okay,
right?

20:28.995 --> 20:31.798
Pete, tell me we still have
the rainy day fund at JPM.

20:31.831 --> 20:33.566
- [sighs]

20:33.600 --> 20:34.834
- Pete?

20:34.867 --> 20:36.703
- Should we be freaking out?
- No.

20:36.736 --> 20:39.472
Fortunately, we never had enough
money to invest with him.

20:39.506 --> 20:41.007
But Mother did.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.542
- Where is Mother?

20:42.575 --> 20:43.743
- Candace?

20:43.776 --> 20:45.244
[all gasping]
Candace?

20:45.278 --> 20:46.746
Give me some help here.

20:46.779 --> 20:48.147
- Lex, everyone's saying
something

20:48.180 --> 20:49.816
about a Ponzi scheme.

20:49.849 --> 20:52.619
We didn't have much money
with him, did we?

20:54.854 --> 20:55.888
- Babe.

20:55.922 --> 20:58.825
We still have each other,

20:58.858 --> 21:01.894
and we have our health.

21:01.928 --> 21:04.331
And...
[dry heaves]

21:04.331 --> 21:06.566
And that is all that matters.

21:06.599 --> 21:09.235
- Huh.

21:09.336 --> 21:12.339
[screaming]
No!

21:15.107 --> 21:17.209
- [retches]

21:17.243 --> 21:20.347
[instrumental music]

21:20.347 --> 21:21.681
*

21:21.714 --> 21:24.851
[muffled crying]

21:24.884 --> 21:28.688
- Oh my God,
we got to get out of here.

21:28.721 --> 21:29.789
Kids?

21:29.822 --> 21:31.358
Kids, kids, let's go.

21:31.391 --> 21:32.792
[man screams]
Kids!

21:32.825 --> 21:34.927
- Oh, my god!
[both scream]

21:34.961 --> 21:36.095
- Kids?
Let's go.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.697
both: Kids?
Let's go.

21:37.730 --> 21:39.366
- Let's leave a party
while it's good.

21:39.366 --> 21:40.367
- Yeah, come on, guys!

21:40.400 --> 21:41.901
- But what about dessert?

21:41.934 --> 21:43.069
- Um, we'll have it at home.

21:43.102 --> 21:44.203
Terrific.
- Ooh.

21:44.236 --> 21:46.105
- Okay, so, basically

21:46.138 --> 21:48.274
we're the richest people
at this party?

21:48.375 --> 21:51.110
- It would appear so.

21:51.143 --> 21:53.145
[all sobbing]

21:53.179 --> 21:56.148
- For more "Odd Mom Out,"
go to bravotv.com.

21:57.149 --> 21:58.150
- Oh, dear.
