How's it going?

02:36.056 --> 02:37.056
It's shit.

02:37.925 --> 02:39.391

03:35.015 --> 03:37.282
Ah, then I actually

03:54.768 --> 03:56.568
It's really
not like that.

03:56.570 --> 03:59.037

a place to party.

03:59.039 --> 03:59.905
Trev?

03:59.907 --> 04:02.074
It's underground.

04:02.076 --> 04:03.742

9/11 so they built this place.

And,

06:14.508 --> 06:15.640
this one.

06:15.642 --> 06:18.043
Maybe you should eat
something other than mushrooms.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.444
Maybe you should
stop being such a faggot

06:19.446 --> 06:20.545
and have one yourself.

06:23.617 --> 06:25.484
Come on, anybody? Hm?

Sure.

06:47.408 --> 06:49.775

emo dyke chick? Hm?

06:49.777 --> 06:52.644
You want one, what's
your name again?

06:52.646 --> 06:53.845
Shut up, Scott.

06:53.847 --> 06:56.181
What, Joshy, she's emo.

06:56.183 --> 06:58.683
You're emo, you're like
a sad trip to the mall.

06:59.153 --> 07:00.952
Look at her bro, she's got
a face like the food court

07:00.954 --> 07:02.554

07:03.724 --> 07:06.124
You're a dick.

07:06.126 --> 07:07.159
What, I mean you're hot

07:07.161 --> 07:09.227
but like, would it
kill you to smile?

07:10.063 --> 07:12.731
Man, she's such a
fucking downer, bro.

07:12.733 --> 07:14.699
Her mom just
died, fuckhead.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.102
Oh.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.037
Sorry, all right.

07:19.039 --> 07:22.107
Sorry, that sucks,
I'm an asshole.

07:28.449 --> 07:30.081
<i>You have a family
here at home though.</i>

07:30.083 --> 07:32.217
Yeah I know. I'm actually
just wrapping up now, so...

07:32.219 --> 07:34.119
I told you to watch him.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.053
That was your sole purpose.

07:35.055 --> 07:36.421
Yeah, and I'm gonna
do that right now.

07:36.423 --> 07:38.790
If he is down there
fucking some 15 year old,

07:38.792 --> 07:40.292
it's your job.

07:40.294 --> 07:41.359
Understood.

07:48.368 --> 07:49.835
Uh-oh.

07:49.837 --> 07:51.136
Morning.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.271
And I say that because
it's in fact the next day.

07:53.273 --> 07:56.074
You guys have 10 minutes
to clean all this shit up

07:56.076 --> 07:58.009

07:58.011 --> 07:59.244
Oooh.

07:59.746 --> 08:01.046
That's not an empty threat.

08:01.048 --> 08:02.481

08:02.783 --> 08:04.449

I'm not kidding.

08:08.889 --> 08:10.188
Yeah, that's funny.

So how about you, huh?

08:19.333 --> 08:20.432
Feeling good?

08:20.934 --> 08:23.502
Kit doesn't have feelings.

08:23.504 --> 08:26.571
Per se, I mean. She's not
like a traditional human.

08:32.379 --> 08:33.879
Okay, I'm gonna
go to the bathroom,

08:33.881 --> 08:35.347

08:35.349 --> 08:36.349
Yes.

09:56.330 --> 09:59.631
Haha, hahaha, what the fuck.

09:59.633 --> 10:00.999
The lights should
be back on by now.

10:02.502 --> 10:03.401

10:03.403 --> 10:04.536
Those aren't

Oh.

10:29.997 --> 10:31.396
Thank god.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.632
See, it's just a glitch.

10:37.471 --> 10:38.671
Glitch, whatever, fuck.

10:39.206 --> 10:40.372
I'm getting out of here.

11:00.293 --> 11:02.260
Just, he's right,
listen to him.

11:02.262 --> 11:04.696
Look, those doors
have blast valves

11:04.698 --> 11:06.798
that are set to seal
when the wave hits.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.200

he's a nuclear scientist!

11:09.202 --> 11:10.669

Look, you can't
open the door.

11:15.242 --> 11:17.308
Just in case, okay?

11:20.247 --> 11:21.446
Fine, assholes.

11:21.448 --> 11:23.381
So, what are we supposed to do?

11:27.120 --> 11:28.420
I'm not sure.

No.

12:55.375 --> 12:56.674

12:58.345 --> 13:00.044

13:05.752 --> 13:06.818
What?

13:07.320 --> 13:08.820
Do you know, when
you were a little girl,

13:08.822 --> 13:10.522
you always feel like
there's that one person

13:10.524 --> 13:12.323
who's gonna come and save you?

13:15.796 --> 13:17.896
For me it's my dad.

13:20.734 --> 13:24.235
I just feel like he's up there
figuring everything out,

13:24.237 --> 13:25.870
like he's hit the
roads or whatever

13:25.872 --> 13:28.940
and he'll find a way down here.

13:40.654 --> 13:41.853
Kit, hey.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.261
I really think we
should stop trying the phone

13:50.263 --> 13:52.764
and just concentrate
on the radio.

15:41.875 --> 15:43.074
You okay?

15:43.443 --> 15:44.809
Yeah.

15:45.745 --> 15:48.112
Told you to stop
asking me if I'm okay.

15:54.587 --> 15:56.220
No, that's not
what we're saying.

15:56.222 --> 15:57.155
That's what you said.

15:57.157 --> 15:58.356
Center line to
the house is dead.

15:58.358 --> 15:59.557
There's no
radio signal either.

15:59.559 --> 16:02.493
Okay. So worst
case scenario, right?

16:02.495 --> 16:04.095
How long exactly?

16:04.097 --> 16:05.763
We can't be exact, Amy.

16:05.765 --> 16:07.598
If we conserve, there's
the diesel generator.

16:07.600 --> 16:10.535
And if the water
calculations are correct

16:10.537 --> 16:12.437
I think we probably have
about eight to nine months.

16:12.439 --> 16:14.305
Okay. But not
worst case scenario,

16:14.307 --> 16:17.342
it is completely possible that
whatever happened out there

16:17.344 --> 16:18.977
is just local.

16:18.979 --> 16:20.511
Like three mile island.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.074
That's our
positive scenario?

16:24.484 --> 16:25.950
Okay, just checking.

16:25.952 --> 16:29.387
Local or not, it
may be toxic out there.

16:29.389 --> 16:30.955
So we wait.

16:30.957 --> 16:32.991
I thought you said the
radiation levels were good?

16:32.993 --> 16:34.392
They are, down here.

16:34.394 --> 16:35.426
It doesn't matter.

16:35.428 --> 16:37.328
Kitty dick doesn't
make the rules.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.363
Don't call him that.

16:38.365 --> 16:39.397
He doesn't
make the rules,

16:39.399 --> 16:41.132
not for me, not for
anyone, okay Chris?

16:41.134 --> 16:42.734
I'm just trying
to keep everyone safe.

16:42.736 --> 16:44.369
Yeah, well
reading a couple pages

16:44.371 --> 16:46.537
in a fucking manual
doesn't make you king

16:46.539 --> 16:48.272
of this crisis plan, okay?

16:50.910 --> 16:52.076
Look, there.

16:52.579 --> 16:55.079
See, I got a text.

16:55.081 --> 16:56.614
You know what that means?

16:56.616 --> 16:57.982
World's still out there.

17:19.973 --> 17:21.672
Wanna sit down?

17:21.674 --> 17:23.207
No, I don't
wanna sit down.

17:23.209 --> 17:25.343
You know what I wanna do?
I'll tell you what I wanna do.

17:25.345 --> 17:27.979
I want to open
this fucking door.

17:31.618 --> 17:33.718
Josh, turn that shit off.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.486
We're not turning off
our only point of contact

17:35.488 --> 17:36.921
with the outside world.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.624
Are you fucking stupid?

17:39.626 --> 17:42.093
I got a text. My mom
texted me from Dubai.

17:42.095 --> 17:43.761
One text doesn't
prove anything.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.564
It could be a satellite
bouncing off delayed signals.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.633
It doesn't prove there's
anybody out there.

17:48.635 --> 17:49.700
Turn that shit off!

17:49.702 --> 17:51.702
- Leave it on.
- Easy, Scott.

17:51.704 --> 17:52.870
Well then get
some fucking headphones.

17:52.872 --> 17:55.706
Keep it on. If
there's someone out there,

17:55.708 --> 17:57.108
they need to be able to hear us.

17:57.110 --> 18:01.312
Jesus, I am so sick of
your stupid shit, you bitch!

18:01.314 --> 18:02.947
Jesus.

18:02.949 --> 18:05.049
Back off.

18:06.219 --> 18:07.251
Okay.

18:07.253 --> 18:08.293
You stay out of this.

18:11.624 --> 18:12.824
Apologize.

18:15.061 --> 18:16.427
I swear to God.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.729
I'll put a bullet through
your fucking head.

18:22.235 --> 18:24.035
I'm sorry, okay?

18:29.742 --> 18:31.642
Now we have a problem
to solve here.

18:31.644 --> 18:33.711
And I think it'd be best
if we put our efforts

18:33.713 --> 18:35.713
towards that instead
of having to babysit

18:35.715 --> 18:37.648
the oldest person in here.

18:38.818 --> 18:40.017
Right?

18:40.019 --> 18:41.052
Yeah.

18:41.054 --> 18:42.153
Yeah, you're right.

18:42.722 --> 18:46.190
So why doesn't everybody just

18:49.829 --> 18:50.862
breathe?

19:03.509 --> 19:05.309
Where the hell
did you find that?

19:06.546 --> 19:08.246
Closet in the back.

19:08.848 --> 19:10.081
Just lying there?

19:10.350 --> 19:11.350
Yeah.

19:11.851 --> 19:14.685
I mean, it was in a case.

19:14.687 --> 19:15.887
Okay, um.

19:18.024 --> 19:20.324
Do you wanna show me
where you got this from?

19:26.533 --> 19:27.865
You okay?

19:27.867 --> 19:29.167
I can't fucking breathe.

19:29.169 --> 19:32.003
There is no air and
my heart is pounding

19:32.005 --> 19:34.372
out of my fucking
chest, all right?

19:34.374 --> 19:35.806
And you know what, bro?

19:35.808 --> 19:36.941
I'm starting to
get a bad feeling.

19:36.943 --> 19:39.844
Like a real bad
feeling, alright?

19:40.446 --> 19:41.679
Fuck.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.249
Everything's
gonna be okay.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.191
Based on?

20:04.037 --> 20:05.557
You may wanna
start saving those.

21:20.580 --> 21:22.446
Well I
found the tampons.

21:25.285 --> 21:26.317
Nice.

21:28.755 --> 21:30.821
Scrambled eggs and tampons.

21:43.136 --> 21:44.136
Fuck.

21:47.206 --> 21:48.472
Come on, come on.

21:49.842 --> 21:51.442
Come on, please.

21:51.444 --> 21:52.444
Please call.

22:45.231 --> 22:46.330
Antipsychotic?

22:47.333 --> 22:48.466
What?

22:48.601 --> 22:50.034
Oh, I know my pills.

22:50.036 --> 22:51.869
Those are antipsychotics.

22:53.139 --> 22:54.638
You went through my shit?

22:56.175 --> 22:57.241
Whatever.

22:59.612 --> 23:00.911
I don't need them.

23:01.614 --> 23:03.647
They're just in case.

23:03.649 --> 23:04.915
Yeah.

23:05.785 --> 23:08.652
What have you
got, like 12 left? Hm?

23:10.990 --> 23:13.491
You ever actually
go cold turkey?

23:20.299 --> 23:21.299
Me and you,

23:23.002 --> 23:25.302
oh we're in trouble down here.

23:26.139 --> 23:31.108
See I got brothers here
or half brothers, anyway.

23:31.778 --> 23:33.377
Half family.

23:34.747 --> 23:37.314
They should at least
half look out for me.

23:39.852 --> 23:41.752
But when shit gets bad for you,

23:43.423 --> 23:48.325
and your brain goes
off the fucking rails,

23:50.897 --> 23:52.596
who's gonna have
your back down here,

23:55.468 --> 23:57.001
Kit?

24:12.185 --> 24:13.551
Here.

24:14.854 --> 24:16.387
You should take this.

24:17.957 --> 24:19.423
Just in case.

24:30.169 --> 24:33.003
First you pull a gun on
me and then you give it to me.

24:33.739 --> 24:35.606
You're more fucked up than I am.

24:37.376 --> 24:38.709
Beautiful.

24:51.290 --> 24:53.991
You know you can't
stay here either, Kit.

24:55.394 --> 24:57.695
You and me, we are not
like these assholes.

25:01.734 --> 25:03.534
You should come with me.

25:14.680 --> 25:16.647
You should go with him.

25:18.084 --> 25:19.550
At least think about it.

25:19.986 --> 25:21.585
Where?

25:21.587 --> 25:23.020
Where am I supposed to go?

25:25.224 --> 25:26.690
I don't know clinic?

25:28.160 --> 25:30.160
There's food
and water here.

25:32.231 --> 25:34.465
We have no idea
what's out there.

25:36.903 --> 25:38.569
There's only two suits.

25:40.039 --> 25:43.807
If they take them, that's
it. You're stuck in here.

25:45.778 --> 25:47.578
You can leave, but,

25:56.022 --> 25:58.689
This is a fucking
deathtrap down here!

25:59.659 --> 26:01.458
All right, even if you're right
about the water holding up,

26:01.460 --> 26:03.694
even if the world's gone
to some kind of shit,

26:05.064 --> 26:07.231
you've only got another
eight months left.

26:08.834 --> 26:10.768
Wouldn't you rather know, huh?

26:12.104 --> 26:17.007
Wouldn't any of you rather
make some kind of effort?

26:17.009 --> 26:19.076
You need to
leave us a suit.

26:19.078 --> 26:20.277
You can't take both.

26:20.279 --> 26:22.580
Yeah, the fuck I can't.

26:22.582 --> 26:23.647
You guys are just gonna sit here

26:23.649 --> 26:25.983
and follow Kitty dick's
little crisis plan.

26:25.985 --> 26:27.484
We might need
one in an emergency.

26:27.486 --> 26:29.053
Yeah, well you know
what, this is an emergency.

26:29.055 --> 26:31.655
No, she's right.
You can't have both.

26:32.091 --> 26:33.457
Okay, genius, okay.

26:33.459 --> 26:35.092
If I can't have
both, then who gets

26:35.094 --> 26:37.361
the second suit, huh?
The one fucking suit.

26:37.363 --> 26:39.396
Because when shit
goes tits up in here

26:39.398 --> 26:42.333
and believe me, it will,
who gets the suit, huh?

26:42.335 --> 26:43.467
Amy.

26:44.170 --> 26:45.502
Oh come on.

26:45.504 --> 26:47.771
Why does she get the one thing
that's gonna help you guys...

26:47.773 --> 26:49.139
Because I'm pregnant.

26:52.845 --> 26:54.345
I'm pregnant.

26:57.583 --> 27:00.117
Come on, bullshit.
Bullshit you're pregnant.

27:00.119 --> 27:01.518
You're going to
college in the fall.

27:01.520 --> 27:02.553
Uh huh.

27:02.555 --> 27:05.923
And I'll let you do the
math on that one, genius.

27:06.592 --> 27:08.525
You're pregnant,
Trav: She's pregnant.

27:09.428 --> 27:11.362
The second suit stays.

27:13.032 --> 27:14.698
Kit, what the fuck, come
on. We talked about this.

27:14.700 --> 27:16.367
I can't leave them with no suit

27:16.369 --> 27:18.002
and I'm not going
out there without...

27:18.004 --> 27:19.236
Yes, we're
gonna get halfway to...

27:19.238 --> 27:20.671
before these guys do
anything down here.

27:20.673 --> 27:22.706
They get to sit here
and fucking die, okay?

27:22.708 --> 27:23.874
Come on, let's go, let's go.

27:23.876 --> 27:24.942
- I can't.
- Yes you can.

27:24.944 --> 27:26.010
- I can't.
- Yes you can.

27:26.012 --> 27:27.244
- I can't.
- Yes you can!

27:27.246 --> 27:28.746
- I can't!
- I know you can,

27:28.748 --> 27:30.447
so let's go!

27:31.884 --> 27:33.417
I'm sorry.

27:38.124 --> 27:40.224
Ah, this is
a coffin, Chris.

27:41.093 --> 27:43.661
All right bro, it's
a big fucking coffin.

27:45.331 --> 27:48.032
Once you leave
you can't come back,

27:48.034 --> 27:49.266
suit or no suit.

27:49.969 --> 27:51.168
You could be
radioactive to the point

27:51.170 --> 27:52.436
of getting us sick.

27:52.438 --> 27:55.372
Scotty, please, just
give it another week.

27:57.043 --> 27:58.375
No.

27:59.378 --> 28:01.178
Why don't you come
with me, Chris, huh?

28:03.015 --> 28:04.481
Why don't you come with me?

28:05.851 --> 28:08.552
Come on, I need you, little
bro, come with me, please.

28:10.356 --> 28:12.322
Please, I need someone, man.

28:13.893 --> 28:14.992
Okay?

28:14.994 --> 28:15.926
- I can't.
- Please?

28:15.928 --> 28:16.960
I'm sorry.

28:16.962 --> 28:19.196
- Please.
- Scott.

28:20.032 --> 28:22.032
- Please.
- I can't.

28:46.325 --> 28:48.625
Nobody's coming with me?

29:29.168 --> 29:31.401
<i>Warning, warning.</i>

29:31.403 --> 29:34.838
<i>Main access point inner
doors have been opened.</i>

29:34.840 --> 29:39.109
<i>Breach, breach. Elevated
risk of contamination.</i>

30:17.049 --> 30:18.248
You okay?

30:18.250 --> 30:19.483
Yeah.

30:20.085 --> 30:21.885
I'm fine.

30:23.088 --> 30:24.088
Can I come in?

30:27.293 --> 30:28.592
Yeah.

30:37.069 --> 30:39.436
It's just a lot.

30:43.008 --> 30:45.609
Guess you won't mind
if I take all the tampons.

30:48.280 --> 30:49.680
They're all yours.

30:59.158 --> 31:00.838
Just hope
he's okay out there.

31:03.796 --> 31:04.796
Thanks.

31:06.232 --> 31:07.564
For staying.

31:11.337 --> 31:13.704
Just gotta keep
our heads up, huh.

31:28.554 --> 31:29.987
Still think
it's worth it?

31:29.989 --> 31:31.405
It's not.

31:31.406 --> 31:32.822
We can get 2,000 calories
a day without it

31:32.825 --> 31:34.324
and we save a ton
of energy and water.

31:34.326 --> 31:36.026
It doesn't make any sense.

31:36.028 --> 31:37.828
Okay, vote.

31:37.830 --> 31:40.631
Hydroponics and planting,
hands up for yes.

31:45.437 --> 31:46.570
Stupid.

31:46.572 --> 31:49.773
Okay, so um, Josh, you'll
be in charge of the farm.

31:49.775 --> 31:50.941
Rationing is done.

31:50.943 --> 31:52.876
Is there anything else
anyone wanted to talk about?

31:52.878 --> 31:58.248
Um, intimacy aids? Some
of which require batteries.

31:58.450 --> 31:59.750
Just like Kit.

32:04.056 --> 32:08.525
Um, just seeing as I
seem to be the only one

32:08.527 --> 32:10.160
that holds unpopular
opinions here,

32:12.831 --> 32:13.931
sorry Amy.

32:15.034 --> 32:16.034
But if you were,

32:18.837 --> 32:20.971
maybe we should think
about an abortion.

32:24.576 --> 32:27.878
It sounds terrible
but it's safer by far.

32:28.681 --> 32:30.514
And it saves resources.

32:36.088 --> 32:37.821
Just something to think about.

33:13.392 --> 33:14.591
Sorry.

33:16.228 --> 33:18.195
If that was insensitive.

33:20.699 --> 33:21.832
I just,

33:24.870 --> 33:26.503
sometimes I can
be a little blunt.

33:28.540 --> 33:29.840
It's okay.

33:49.094 --> 33:51.228
I like what you've
done with the place.

33:58.170 --> 34:01.905
I just wanted to say,
we'll get through this.

34:04.443 --> 34:06.910
Both this and that.

34:08.647 --> 34:10.914
Your optimism is impressive

34:12.317 --> 34:14.518
and sometimes a little annoying.

34:14.520 --> 34:18.188
Maybe a little charming.

34:19.591 --> 34:20.690
Or a little sexy?

34:20.692 --> 34:23.460
Okay all right, bye.

34:49.353 --> 34:51.221
She's up at night.

34:51.223 --> 34:52.355
You're up at night.

34:52.357 --> 34:53.422
No, it's different.

34:53.425 --> 34:55.592
She's like a little
weasel or something.

34:55.594 --> 34:56.726
A weasel?

34:56.728 --> 35:00.330
I mean first
she's going with him

35:00.332 --> 35:02.099
and now she's not.

35:02.434 --> 35:03.667
She didn't know
Amy was pregnant.

35:03.669 --> 35:05.936
Yeah, now she wants
her to have an abortion.

35:07.406 --> 35:08.705
I don't like her.

35:10.175 --> 35:11.741
And I don't trust her.

36:20.746 --> 36:22.179
Fall leaves.

36:28.453 --> 36:29.953
Wood smoke.

36:33.058 --> 36:34.457
Apples.

36:38.430 --> 36:40.430
Suntan lotion.

36:45.103 --> 36:46.436
Coconut smell.

37:28.080 --> 37:29.479
My dog.

37:30.816 --> 37:32.482
Like taking walks outside,

37:33.819 --> 37:35.952
or being outside at all.

37:37.456 --> 37:39.990
Yeah.

37:39.992 --> 37:40.992
Kit.

37:41.660 --> 37:42.993
Your turn, same question.

37:43.562 --> 37:45.362
What do I miss the most?

37:47.132 --> 37:48.164
Hm.

37:49.801 --> 37:51.301
The newspaper.

37:54.740 --> 37:57.007
Like the morning
ritual of reading it.

37:59.544 --> 38:01.478
Sitting next to my mom.

38:02.848 --> 38:04.414
The smell of her coffee.

38:10.789 --> 38:12.829
Hey, do you know what's
wrong with puppy love?

38:16.028 --> 38:17.494
Your assholes are too tight.

38:18.563 --> 38:20.430
Barum tss! Thank you so much.

38:20.432 --> 38:23.633
I'm gonna be here for
nine months, every night!

38:23.635 --> 38:24.968
Yeah, you're disgusting.

40:24.990 --> 40:25.989
She's stealing.

40:25.991 --> 40:27.056
There's no proof.

40:27.058 --> 40:28.858
No, we have
to search her room.

40:30.629 --> 40:31.629
Josh?

40:32.697 --> 40:34.397
We're not the gestapo.

40:48.613 --> 40:51.414
I was told there
would be a free Continental.

40:53.018 --> 40:54.717
What kind of resort is this?

40:58.757 --> 41:00.397
So what are
we talking about?

41:01.860 --> 41:03.059
We're gonna
burn her at the stake

41:03.061 --> 41:04.627
'cause she's a
fucking insomniac.

41:04.629 --> 41:07.630
She was taking food,
Josh. I know what I saw.

41:09.134 --> 41:11.267
You may not realize this
because of where you grew up

41:11.269 --> 41:14.404
but in the real world,
bad shit does happen.

41:14.406 --> 41:17.507
People lie and they
cheat and they steal.

41:18.877 --> 41:20.510
And people die.

41:22.514 --> 41:23.680
Okay, Jesus.

41:24.015 --> 41:25.281
Your mom died.

41:26.485 --> 41:28.551
Doesn't make you the queen
of everything shitty.

41:30.755 --> 41:32.555
That's not fair.

41:32.557 --> 41:34.123
All our moms are dead.

41:36.428 --> 41:38.061
So fucking save it.

41:43.735 --> 41:45.902
I'm sorry.

41:45.904 --> 41:47.170
I'm sorry too.

41:55.981 --> 41:57.180
Hi.

42:00.652 --> 42:02.519
Sorry, just passing out lunch.

42:07.926 --> 42:10.460
You know, I always pictured

42:10.462 --> 42:14.864
the end of the world as
like a big inclusive orgy.

42:14.866 --> 42:17.867
But, no.

42:17.869 --> 42:20.503
Even the apocalypse
is heteronormative.

42:36.288 --> 42:38.454
Great expectations.

42:43.728 --> 42:45.295
That was a memorable day

42:46.164 --> 42:48.398
for it made great changes in me.

42:50.168 --> 42:52.302
But it is the same
with any life.

42:53.104 --> 42:56.506
Imagine one selected
day struck out of it

42:56.508 --> 42:59.809
and think how different
its course would have been.

43:01.613 --> 43:03.212
Pause you who read this

43:03.214 --> 43:06.249
and think for a moment
of the long chain

43:06.251 --> 43:10.687
of iron or gold, of
thorns or flowers,

43:10.689 --> 43:12.822
that would never have bound you.

43:14.392 --> 43:16.593
But for the formation
of the first link

43:16.595 --> 43:19.162
on one memorable day.

43:32.744 --> 43:36.713
We are in Bunker
1899 Canandega Lane

43:36.715 --> 43:38.247
requesting assistance please.

43:38.883 --> 43:42.518
Repeat, we are in bunker 1899

43:42.520 --> 43:45.254
Canandega Lane requesting
assistance please.

43:47.492 --> 43:49.158
Repeat.

43:49.160 --> 43:52.228
Repeat, we are in bunker 1899

43:52.230 --> 43:54.297
Canandega Lane requesting
assistance please.

43:55.400 --> 43:59.569
Repeat, we are in bunker one...

43:59.571 --> 44:04.107
Repeat, we are in bunker
1899 Canandega Lane

44:04.109 --> 44:06.809
requesting assistance please.

44:10.482 --> 44:11.482
Chris.

44:13.218 --> 44:14.384
You need to sleep.

44:20.358 --> 44:21.358
Chris.

44:31.836 --> 44:33.936
We can't let him in.
We'll all be sick in a day!

44:33.938 --> 44:35.438
Josh, there is no proof
that there is anything...

44:35.440 --> 44:36.806
He's writing
something else!

44:44.382 --> 44:46.582
He says everything is fine.

44:46.584 --> 44:48.551
Then why does he
wanna come back in here?

44:49.220 --> 44:50.420
Oh my god.

44:51.089 --> 44:52.221
Look at his face.

45:20.318 --> 45:22.985
Look, he's got the gun.

45:25.690 --> 45:29.192
We can't just
leave him out there.

45:29.194 --> 45:30.593
We need to know what's going on.

45:30.595 --> 45:31.728
Don't.

47:27.245 --> 47:29.812
It's beautiful.

47:30.748 --> 47:31.981
Yeah.

47:35.653 --> 47:37.119
I don't know, I
thought we could have

47:37.121 --> 47:39.055
a little memorial or something.

47:43.094 --> 47:44.694
Add whoever you want.

47:52.136 --> 47:53.669
No offense, Camilla.

47:54.439 --> 47:57.473
But the tree looks kinda
like a mushroom cloud.

48:05.984 --> 48:07.083
Well fuck.

48:08.019 --> 48:09.952
Yeah it does.

48:09.954 --> 48:12.889
It's a nuclear killer tree,
it's a tree of mass destruction.

48:12.891 --> 48:13.923
Awesome.

48:32.310 --> 48:33.542
Hey.

48:35.580 --> 48:38.414
I know this isn't something
either of you asked for.

48:39.817 --> 48:41.717
But I decided it's
safer to wait.

48:44.088 --> 48:47.556
So if no one comes for
us, I might have the baby.

48:49.294 --> 48:51.460
So I was wondering
if you guys might...

48:53.798 --> 48:55.464
Yes.

49:36.541 --> 49:37.940
You're stealing food!

49:37.942 --> 49:38.908
No, no, I wasn't!

49:39.811 --> 49:41.243
You're
fucking kidding me!

49:42.613 --> 49:44.914
I should
fucking kill you.

50:24.756 --> 50:26.122
I was saving food.

50:28.259 --> 50:29.725
For your baby.

50:32.230 --> 50:34.030
Kit. You-

50:37.235 --> 50:38.968
Thank you.

50:51.582 --> 50:52.848
I'm sorry.

50:54.452 --> 50:55.851
I made a mistake.

51:00.425 --> 51:01.857
I'm sorry.

51:03.461 --> 51:05.027
It's fine.

51:06.264 --> 51:07.296
Forgiven.

51:09.267 --> 51:10.633
Forgotten.

51:48.706 --> 51:50.172
Did you make
another fat joke?

52:12.330 --> 52:13.729
Hello.

52:16.534 --> 52:17.800
It's late.

52:21.272 --> 52:23.272
Someone has
to do something.

52:25.643 --> 52:28.644
There needs to be rules
against stuff like that.

52:29.714 --> 52:31.313
What he did.

52:35.786 --> 52:37.453
Adults can have
baby from there too, Kit,

52:37.455 --> 52:39.054
same as babies.

52:42.326 --> 52:44.393
My mom did a lot
of stupid things.

52:45.329 --> 52:46.428
Smoked a pack a
day, for example,

52:46.430 --> 52:47.897
gave herself cancer.

52:49.400 --> 52:50.866
I'm sorry.

52:52.970 --> 52:54.570
The one thing she said to me,

52:54.572 --> 52:56.639
over and over again,
she swore by it

52:56.641 --> 52:58.107
like a fucking
religion, she said

52:58.109 --> 53:00.176
"Never trust a girl
with shifty eyes."

53:03.314 --> 53:04.380
You don't believe me.

53:05.583 --> 53:06.949
You think I stole food.

53:11.923 --> 53:13.956
You have
shifty eyes, Kit.

53:52.296 --> 53:53.963
What?

53:53.965 --> 53:56.565
You went out and took the
suit off Scott's body?

53:56.567 --> 53:58.867
I washed it all in deacon.

53:58.869 --> 54:00.469
You should have
consulted with us.

54:00.471 --> 54:01.904
I took a shower!

54:01.906 --> 54:04.573
Have you done an
updated radiation reading?

54:04.575 --> 54:06.442
You should up your
iodine probably.

54:06.444 --> 54:09.778
- Let me worry about that.
- How was it up there?

54:12.350 --> 54:13.630
Here's what's gonna happen.

54:14.619 --> 54:18.320
I keep my room, you stay out.

54:20.858 --> 54:22.858
We split off the
remaining resources.

54:23.594 --> 54:27.496
Food, water,
medicine, everything.

54:27.498 --> 54:29.365
I want my share.

54:30.768 --> 54:32.668
Divide it into sevens.

54:32.670 --> 54:33.902
Why sevens?

54:34.272 --> 54:35.704
The baby.

54:35.706 --> 54:37.006
This isn't right.

54:37.608 --> 54:39.041
We were better off
pooling resources.

54:39.043 --> 54:41.143
I am not
asking for opinions.

54:42.813 --> 54:44.546
I am done pooling.

54:45.983 --> 54:47.850
We need to vote.

54:48.286 --> 54:49.918
We didn't vote
on Scott leaving.

54:51.188 --> 54:52.988
We didn't vote on
letting him back in.

54:53.658 --> 54:55.024
So?

54:55.026 --> 54:56.425
So let's not pretend
this is some kind

54:56.427 --> 54:57.726
of functional democracy.

54:57.728 --> 54:59.495
Okay, fine.

54:59.864 --> 55:02.331
That's what you want?

55:02.333 --> 55:03.799
Divide the stuff.

56:52.543 --> 56:56.845
<i>Warning. Oxygen
recycling degrading.</i>

56:56.847 --> 56:58.747
<i>22 percent remaining.</i>

56:58.749 --> 57:00.883

57:00.885 --> 57:04.153

57:04.155 --> 57:05.988
<i>Begin conservation mode.</i>

58:03.347 --> 58:05.013
Thanks

58:09.253 --> 58:10.385
Sorry.

58:12.957 --> 58:15.057
I shouldn't have taken
one of your puffs.

58:18.095 --> 58:20.229
Feels like the air is getting...

58:21.031 --> 58:22.297
Thinner.

58:29.306 --> 58:30.405
What?

58:32.576 --> 58:34.076
Nothing.

58:37.915 --> 58:39.147
I was just wondering.

58:39.917 --> 58:41.650
Maybe if we'd ever...

58:49.660 --> 58:52.127
I mean, life is short, right?

58:54.932 --> 58:58.066
Real short potentially.

01:00:17.881 --> 01:00:19.348
<i>Emergency reserves.</i>

01:00:19.350 --> 01:00:22.050
<i>Medical supplies at

01:00:22.052 --> 01:00:26.388

01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:28.490

01:00:33.263 --> 01:00:35.797
<i>will repeat broadcast

01:00:36.934 --> 01:00:39.468
Okay, Detroit is only
600 miles away, give or take.

01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:40.636
I wanna go.

01:00:41.772 --> 01:00:43.105
I'm coming with you.

01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:47.609
Can you walk that far?

01:00:47.611 --> 01:00:48.810
If the roads are
closed, then she...

01:00:48.812 --> 01:00:50.278
I don't care.

01:00:50.748 --> 01:00:52.748
I need to go.

01:00:53.984 --> 01:00:55.784
I'm already
sitting in a hot tub

01:00:55.786 --> 01:00:57.886
with an ice cream cone.

01:00:58.889 --> 01:01:00.589
I can also see the sky.

01:01:01.025 --> 01:01:02.457
Oh!

01:01:02.459 --> 01:01:05.894
Hot tub, ice
cream and the sky.

01:01:05.896 --> 01:01:07.362
And me?

01:01:07.898 --> 01:01:09.097
No bathing suit.

01:01:09.099 --> 01:01:10.499
Never.

01:02:12.096 --> 01:02:13.628
Help.

01:02:14.598 --> 01:02:16.465
Ow.

01:02:17.267 --> 01:02:19.000
I don't know.

01:02:19.002 --> 01:02:20.736
What's happening?

01:04:01.071 --> 01:04:02.437
It's okay.

01:04:03.473 --> 01:04:04.639
It's okay.

01:04:17.487 --> 01:04:19.154
Go to the beach
and we'll go swimming,

01:04:19.156 --> 01:04:21.857
would you like that?

01:04:21.859 --> 01:04:23.191
Mhmm?

01:04:23.193 --> 01:04:25.193
I'll take you away
from these bad people.

01:04:25.195 --> 01:04:27.829
I'll take you away
from these bad people.

01:04:27.831 --> 01:04:28.997
Kit?

01:04:30.834 --> 01:04:32.901
What are you?

01:04:32.903 --> 01:04:34.936
She was hungry.

01:04:35.272 --> 01:04:37.606
I think you
should give me the baby.

01:04:41.144 --> 01:04:42.711
She needed me.

01:04:43.413 --> 01:04:45.146
It's okay.

01:04:45.148 --> 01:04:47.382
Yeah, I'll just take her.

01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:52.587
I'm-
Camilla: It's okay, it's okay.

01:04:55.459 --> 01:04:56.791
Come here.

01:04:57.261 --> 01:04:58.593
Come here.

01:04:59.096 --> 01:05:00.729
Come here.

01:05:01.298 --> 01:05:02.931
There you go.

01:05:02.933 --> 01:05:04.599
Here we go.

01:05:05.535 --> 01:05:06.735
Here.

01:05:07.704 --> 01:05:08.837
Yeah.

01:06:20.911 --> 01:06:22.831
<i>I'm gonna give
Amy a proper burial.</i>

01:06:25.482 --> 01:06:28.650
<i>This is the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.</i>

01:06:31.188 --> 01:06:32.587
<i>Goodbye.</i>

01:06:35.492 --> 01:06:37.959
<i>Love, Chris.</i>

01:06:48.605 --> 01:06:51.239
You took
your hand in mine.

01:06:51.241 --> 01:06:54.743
And we went out
of the ruined place.

01:06:56.646 --> 01:07:00.582
In all the broad expanse
of tranquil light.

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:04.986
I saw no party for me.

01:09:10.747 --> 01:09:12.386
What the hell
are you doing?

01:09:14.718 --> 01:09:16.584
I'm taking care of her.

01:09:16.586 --> 01:09:18.153
Give me the baby.

01:09:19.389 --> 01:09:20.421
She was crying.

01:09:20.423 --> 01:09:21.689
No she wasn't.

01:09:31.434 --> 01:09:33.134
Stay away from her.

01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:32.126
For Sarah.

01:10:32.696 --> 01:10:34.462
That's not her name.

01:10:38.768 --> 01:10:40.301
For her.

01:10:42.339 --> 01:10:43.404
I promised Amy.

01:10:47.444 --> 01:10:48.444
Kit.

01:10:52.349 --> 01:10:53.414
We'd like the gun.

01:10:55.885 --> 01:10:59.320
You have it, right?

01:11:01.391 --> 01:11:02.790
Give us the gun.

01:11:04.661 --> 01:11:06.594
Lay her down here.

01:11:06.596 --> 01:11:07.795
Josh.

01:11:08.298 --> 01:11:09.430
She's tired.

01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:18.373
Hey.

01:11:19.442 --> 01:11:20.541
Hey!

01:11:23.179 --> 01:11:24.279
Look at me.

01:11:24.281 --> 01:11:27.115
Stop fucking around,
stop looking at her!

01:11:29.019 --> 01:11:32.987
You get the gun and
you bring it in here.

01:11:32.989 --> 01:11:34.656
You get that fucking thing

01:11:34.658 --> 01:11:36.357
and you give us the gun.

01:11:39.663 --> 01:11:40.828
Make me.

01:12:23.139 --> 01:12:24.706
Where the
fuck are you going?

01:12:24.708 --> 01:12:26.207
She's mine.

01:12:26.209 --> 01:12:28.649
You stay away from her
or I'll fucking kill you, Kit.

01:12:39.255 --> 01:12:40.255
Okay.

01:12:41.358 --> 01:12:42.824
Okay.

01:12:42.826 --> 01:12:44.025
There we go.

01:12:44.794 --> 01:12:46.561
I can't sleep either.

01:13:26.669 --> 01:13:28.903
<i>Warning, warning.</i>

01:13:28.905 --> 01:13:32.140
<i>Water leak in

01:13:32.142 --> 01:13:35.676
<i>Shutting down tanks B1 and B2.</i>

01:13:35.678 --> 01:13:38.146
<i>Diverting flow.</i>

<i>Immediate action required.</i>

01:13:40.683 --> 01:13:44.018
<i>Immediate action required.</i>

01:13:45.688 --> 01:13:47.688
Kit, where's the baby?

01:14:12.248 --> 01:14:14.282
<i>Immediate
action required.</i>

01:14:14.284 --> 01:14:16.951
<i>Preparing hibernation mode.</i>

01:14:16.953 --> 01:14:19.287
<i>All essential

01:14:19.289 --> 01:14:22.890
<i>Heating, water, and

<i>Electrical

<i>Temporary suspension and
rebooting the current.</i>

01:16:47.403 --> 01:16:49.904
I don't wanna
hurt you, Camilla.

01:16:57.547 --> 01:16:58.879
Give me the baby.

01:17:02.518 --> 01:17:04.418
Give her to me.

01:17:05.888 --> 01:17:08.556
I need to take care of her.

01:17:14.397 --> 01:17:17.398
We're all on
the same side.

01:17:18.701 --> 01:17:20.167
Scott.

01:17:21.504 --> 01:17:22.703
Travis.

01:17:25.808 --> 01:17:27.274
Amy.

01:17:28.011 --> 01:17:29.577
Chris.

01:17:31.514 --> 01:17:32.546
You.

01:17:34.350 --> 01:17:35.549
Us.

01:17:37.253 --> 01:17:40.287
We're all on the same side.

01:17:46.896 --> 01:17:49.163
Give her the baby.

01:17:54.604 --> 01:17:57.238
Let her hold the baby.

01:18:30.139 --> 01:18:31.779
We're going
to call her Amy.

01:18:38.748 --> 01:18:39.947
Yeah.

01:19:08.778 --> 01:19:10.411
We need to leave.

01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:12.279
Now?

01:19:12.281 --> 01:19:13.781
Tonight.

01:19:15.284 --> 01:19:17.418
Okay.

01:19:17.987 --> 01:19:19.687
Okay, we'll leave.

01:19:24.293 --> 01:19:26.293
Fuck, then what?

01:19:26.295 --> 01:19:28.028
I don't know, okay.

01:19:29.031 --> 01:19:31.866
I don't have a fucking clue.

01:19:32.435 --> 01:19:34.969
We go out there and
we do what we can.

01:19:36.439 --> 01:19:37.738
And we love each other.

01:19:39.909 --> 01:19:41.442
And we take care of the baby.

01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:45.780
An honest answer.

01:19:48.184 --> 01:19:49.984
I'm so fucking scared.

01:19:53.289 --> 01:19:54.455
Hey.

01:19:55.892 --> 01:19:57.358
But we're together.

01:19:58.561 --> 01:20:00.327
