00:00.744 --> 00:02.812
Okay, everybody,
time for the hummingbird lottery.

00:04.080 --> 00:05.914
[all groaning] yay, okay.

00:05.982 --> 00:07.149
You know how it works.

00:07.216 --> 00:08.483
Write your name down
on a piece of paper.

00:08.551 --> 00:10.352
No, they don't win a hummingbird.

00:10.420 --> 00:11.787
I installed hummingbird feeders

00:11.854 --> 00:13.155
In all of the parks.

00:13.222 --> 00:16.558
So the winner gets to
refill those feeders.

00:16.626 --> 00:20.061
Scientifically, hummingbirds
are the world's cutest animals.

00:20.129 --> 00:23.631
I mean, they're so small,
and they have tiny beaks.

00:28.001 --> 00:31.337
Come on. Baby monkeys in diapers?

00:31.404 --> 00:33.706
Yeah. They do.

00:33.773 --> 00:35.441
Baby monkeys in diapers
are the cutest.

00:35.509 --> 00:36.942
Okay, who's it gonna be?

00:37.010 --> 00:39.044
All: Not me. Not me. Not me.

00:39.112 --> 00:41.547
- Jerry.
- Yeah!

00:41.615 --> 00:43.048
You can stop by tomorrow
morning before work.

00:43.116 --> 00:44.550
This is my third time in a row.

00:44.618 --> 00:46.051
It's just a bad
luck streak, buddy.

00:46.119 --> 00:48.254
Next time, I'm sure it'll
definitely be one of us.

00:48.321 --> 00:53.125
But it won't be me
because I always write...

00:53.193 --> 00:55.227
[laughs] yeah.

00:55.295 --> 00:56.729
Yup.

00:56.796 --> 00:59.265
No. I always write my own name.

00:59.332 --> 01:05.236
But just to be safe,
I do add 20 extra jerrys.

01:05.305 --> 01:08.374

01:25.358 --> 01:26.125
And finally we are going

01:26.193 --> 01:28.261
To kick off the
children's concert series

01:28.328 --> 01:30.997
This weekend with a performance
by freddy spaghetti.

01:31.065 --> 01:33.132
I thought freddy
spaghetti o.D.'d.

01:33.200 --> 01:34.333
No. That's mr. Funny noodle.

01:34.401 --> 01:36.135
And he didn't o.D.
His drummer shot him.

01:36.203 --> 01:38.171
- Oh.
- Where's jerry, by the way?

01:38.238 --> 01:39.839
Why isn't he back?
How long does it take

01:39.907 --> 01:40.907
To fill bird feeders?

01:40.974 --> 01:42.508
Maybe he fell into the toilet.

01:42.576 --> 01:43.976
Remember when he
fell into the toilet?

01:44.044 --> 01:45.378
[laughter]

01:45.446 --> 01:46.813
"oh, sorry, guys. Sorry I'm late.

01:46.880 --> 01:48.247
"I got confused and took a shower

01:48.315 --> 01:50.016
After I got dressed
'cause I'm jerry."

01:50.084 --> 01:51.284
[laughter]

01:51.351 --> 01:54.153
David meyers,
the jewish guy who works

01:54.221 --> 01:56.322
At city hall,
once told me something.

01:56.390 --> 02:00.726
A schlemiel is the
guy who spills soup

02:00.794 --> 02:01.794
At a fancy party.

02:01.862 --> 02:05.298
A schlimazel is the
guy he spills it on.

02:05.365 --> 02:10.870
Jerry is both the schlemiel and
the schlimazel of our office.

02:10.937 --> 02:12.905
"and then I put my
underwear on my head

02:12.973 --> 02:14.340
Instead of my butt."

02:14.408 --> 02:16.342
[laughter]

02:16.410 --> 02:18.744
Okay, okay, guys, that's enough.

02:18.812 --> 02:20.413
Unless somebody has
another good one.

02:20.481 --> 02:22.515
[cell phone rings]

02:22.583 --> 02:24.383
Oh. [clears throat]

02:24.451 --> 02:26.486
Hey, ann.

02:26.553 --> 02:28.054
Oh, no.

02:28.122 --> 02:29.989
Jerry, jerry, are you okay?

02:30.057 --> 02:31.691
Ann, is jerry okay?
What's wrong with your arm?

02:31.758 --> 02:33.092
Ann, tell me what's
wrong with jerry's arm.

02:33.160 --> 02:35.027
Jerry, talk to me.
Ann, get jerry to talk to me.

02:35.095 --> 02:37.029
Okay. He's okay.

02:37.097 --> 02:39.565
He's got a couple of scrapes
and a dislocated shoulder.

02:39.633 --> 02:43.102
- What happened?
- You guys are just gonna laugh.

02:43.170 --> 02:44.303
Why? Did you throw
out your shoulder

02:44.371 --> 02:46.005
Trying to swing a honey
pot off your hand?

02:46.073 --> 02:47.106
I was mugged.

02:47.174 --> 02:49.008
- Oh.
- Oh, my god.

02:49.076 --> 02:50.743
Oh, I'm so sorry, jerry.

02:50.811 --> 02:52.411
I was on my way to the
hummingbird feeders,

02:52.479 --> 02:55.114
And I was walking
lord sheldon. - Ew.

02:55.182 --> 02:57.683
Is that code for some
kind of weird sex act?

02:57.751 --> 02:59.018
Lord sheldon is my dog.

02:59.086 --> 03:00.286
My wife named him.

03:00.354 --> 03:01.621
Ew.

03:01.688 --> 03:02.889
These kids,
they came out of nowhere.

03:02.956 --> 03:05.158
They pinned my arm back,
they grabbed my wallet,

03:05.225 --> 03:06.425
And they knocked me to the ground.

03:06.493 --> 03:07.727
How did you counterattack?

03:07.794 --> 03:09.095
Fist to the throat?

03:09.163 --> 03:10.696
Did you hit 'em in the beanbag?

03:10.764 --> 03:13.766
There's no shame in attacking
a criminal's beanbag.

03:13.834 --> 03:15.601
No, I just curled up and
laid still till they left.

03:15.669 --> 03:19.438
Well, that's another
way to play it.

03:19.506 --> 03:20.840
Did any of them
have weird tattoos

03:20.908 --> 03:22.108
Or scars or anything?

03:22.176 --> 03:23.743
If even one of them
had a unique scar,

03:23.810 --> 03:24.810
We got 'em.

03:24.878 --> 03:26.479
I didn't get a good look.

03:26.547 --> 03:28.247
Damn it, jerry.

03:28.315 --> 03:29.782
Sorry. You're the victim.

03:29.850 --> 03:31.817
Sorry. Sorry. [sighs]

03:31.885 --> 03:33.986
I feel like we're
responsible for this.

03:34.054 --> 03:35.855
Why? We didn't mug jerry.

03:35.923 --> 03:38.157
Well, why was he in the
park in the first place?

03:38.225 --> 03:39.492
'cause we tricked
him into going there.

03:39.560 --> 03:41.127
I don't see the connection.

03:41.195 --> 03:42.361
Oh, no, no. This is on us.

03:42.429 --> 03:44.030
It's karma. - Wouldn't it be karma

03:44.097 --> 03:45.498
If we were the ones
that got mugged?

03:45.566 --> 03:46.566
Yeah, that's how
pathetic jerry is.

03:46.633 --> 03:47.934
He can't even get karma right.

03:48.001 --> 03:49.669
[laughter]

03:49.736 --> 03:50.836
No, that's not funny.

03:53.640 --> 03:55.541
Our friend got mugged this morning.

03:55.609 --> 03:57.510
And we will not let
that happen in vain.

03:57.578 --> 03:59.111
He doesn't have a black eye.

03:59.179 --> 04:01.547
Well, frankly, the whole
department has a black eye.

04:01.615 --> 04:02.982
This is our wakeup call, guys.

04:03.050 --> 04:05.017
Jerry's face is the
symbol of failure.

04:05.085 --> 04:06.118
[snickers]

04:06.186 --> 04:08.588
Our failure.
To keep the parks safe.

04:08.655 --> 04:10.022
I have some folders.

04:10.090 --> 04:11.424
Inside are some assignments.

04:11.491 --> 04:13.759
And some homemade taffy.

04:13.827 --> 04:16.161
All: Mm.

04:16.230 --> 04:18.531
April, I want you to check
in with our police liaison.

04:18.599 --> 04:20.132
Donna, I need you to
go to ramsett park.

04:20.200 --> 04:21.434
Tom, you're with me.

04:21.500 --> 04:23.402
So when you say you
want me to check in

04:23.470 --> 04:26.339
With the police liaison,
you mean hook up with him, right?

04:26.406 --> 04:29.375
No. Just check in with him.

04:29.443 --> 04:31.644
Everybody dismissed.
Wait. I want to help.

04:31.712 --> 04:33.179
- What?
- I'm gonna teach everybody

04:33.247 --> 04:36.449
Self-defense, so you
can defend yourselves.

04:36.516 --> 04:38.951
We need it 'cause we certainly
are a bunch of weaklings.

04:39.019 --> 04:40.219
Especially tom.

04:40.287 --> 04:41.887
I am not a weakling.

04:41.955 --> 04:45.124
- Arm-wrestle me right now.
- Okay.

04:45.192 --> 04:48.861
I think I'm more than
holding my own here.

04:48.929 --> 04:54.467
- Three, four, five...
- Hey.

04:54.534 --> 04:55.868
Six.

04:55.936 --> 04:58.037
Hey. How you doing? - Not too bad.

04:58.105 --> 05:00.673
I was just dropping off
jerry from the hospital.

05:00.741 --> 05:01.807
He was mugged in the park.

05:01.875 --> 05:03.709
No. Jerry?

05:03.777 --> 05:05.711
<i>Uh, the black guy with the
looney tunes ties?</i>

05:05.779 --> 05:06.946
I love him.

05:07.014 --> 05:08.814
No, jerry who works with leslie.

05:08.882 --> 05:10.883
[laughs] that jerry?

05:10.951 --> 05:12.652
- Yeah.
- He got mugged?

05:12.719 --> 05:14.887
[laughs] oh, oh, wow.

05:14.955 --> 05:16.322
I mean, that's kind
of a bummer too.

05:16.390 --> 05:20.326
Hey, while I have you here,
what do you think of this?

05:20.394 --> 05:22.595
- Uh...
- Scrotation marks.

05:22.663 --> 05:24.330
I don't know what
you're talking about,

05:24.398 --> 05:25.665
But my gut says no.

05:25.732 --> 05:27.066
New band name.

05:27.134 --> 05:29.835
'cause, mouse rat,
it's a great name,

05:29.903 --> 05:32.605
But, at the same time, it sucks.

05:32.673 --> 05:34.407
So I think we have to change
it just one more time.

05:34.474 --> 05:36.776
Dude, you've got
to stop doing that.

05:36.843 --> 05:38.344
How are people gonna become fans

05:38.412 --> 05:39.745
If they literally don't
know the name of the band

05:39.813 --> 05:41.447
They're listening to?

05:41.515 --> 05:42.682
That is a really good point.

05:42.749 --> 05:45.785
I always had fun with andy.

05:45.852 --> 05:47.453
The problem is,
when you're his girlfriend,

05:47.521 --> 05:50.189
You're also his mother and his maid

05:50.257 --> 05:51.857
And his nurse.

05:51.925 --> 05:53.092
He's completely helpless.

05:53.160 --> 05:55.861
He's like a baby in
a straightjacket.

05:55.929 --> 05:58.764
Ooh, baby in a straightjacket.
That's a good band name.

05:58.832 --> 06:00.866
I should tell him that.

06:00.934 --> 06:02.435
Ha ha, guys, really funny.

06:02.502 --> 06:03.636
Where's the real banner?

06:03.704 --> 06:04.737
We only had an hour.

06:04.805 --> 06:05.971
So did I.

06:06.039 --> 06:07.239
Look what I did.

06:07.307 --> 06:09.642
- Hey, guys.
- Jerry!

06:09.710 --> 06:11.911
Welcome back. All: Hi.

06:11.978 --> 06:13.446
Wow. Really. My gosh.

06:13.513 --> 06:14.880
You should not have gone
to all this trouble.

06:14.948 --> 06:17.049
Oh, it's no trouble
for our buddy.

06:17.117 --> 06:19.051
Here you go. - Oh. Thank you.

06:19.119 --> 06:20.152
Listen. Today is jerry day.

06:20.220 --> 06:21.153
We'll do whatever you want to do.

06:21.221 --> 06:22.254
Anything at all.

06:22.322 --> 06:23.756
Honestly, what I would like to do

06:23.824 --> 06:25.958
Is just have everything
go back to normal.

06:26.026 --> 06:27.626
- That sounds good to me.
- Okay?

06:27.694 --> 06:29.662
I believe you were going
to do a presentation?

06:29.730 --> 06:31.464
Yes, sir, I was.
I will go set up.

06:31.531 --> 06:33.833
Okay.

06:33.900 --> 06:34.900
Remember, you guys,

06:34.968 --> 06:36.602
No jokes, no comments,

06:36.670 --> 06:38.237
Nothing but support.

06:38.305 --> 06:41.240
- He needs a lot of support.
- Tom.

06:41.308 --> 06:42.842
I'm talking about
a bra for a man.

06:42.909 --> 06:44.643
[laughter]

06:44.711 --> 06:47.079
Okay, seriously,
that was the last one.

06:47.147 --> 06:51.350
So as we know,
spring hunting season is upon us.

06:51.418 --> 06:57.089
Uh, anyway, here's the info
about the new licensing system.

06:57.157 --> 06:59.859
Uh... - Jerry, I don't think

06:59.926 --> 07:01.160
Your computer's plugged in.

07:01.228 --> 07:03.929
I'm sorry, guys.
Just gotta power up.

07:03.997 --> 07:06.565
First thing we should
have is my graph

07:06.633 --> 07:08.401
About the season. What?

07:08.468 --> 07:09.502
Wait a minute. No.

07:09.569 --> 07:11.504
That is not the graph.

07:11.571 --> 07:13.305
That is a picture from
my vacation in muncie.

07:13.373 --> 07:14.607
You went on a vacation,

07:14.674 --> 07:16.475
And you chose muncie, indiana?

07:16.543 --> 07:18.310
Yeah. My wife and
I have a timeshare.

07:18.378 --> 07:20.679
- In muncie?
- Tom.

07:20.747 --> 07:23.449
Muncie is a lovely city.

07:23.517 --> 07:26.285
Anyway, hunting and fishing
season is winding down.

07:26.353 --> 07:29.555
Okay, and we all know that it is
already closed season on twout.

07:29.623 --> 07:32.691
So now-- I said twout

07:32.759 --> 07:34.193
Instead of trout.

07:34.261 --> 07:35.694
It happens to everyone.

07:35.762 --> 07:37.830
My marbles are
full of mouth today.

07:37.898 --> 07:41.200
You know what,
has anybody seen my glasses?

07:41.268 --> 07:42.802
I don't even think I can...

07:42.869 --> 07:44.270
[flatulence]

07:51.711 --> 07:53.179
It says here 1:00 meeting.

07:53.246 --> 07:55.014
Who are we meeting with?
Don't worry about it.

07:55.081 --> 07:56.515
Oh, no, please no.

07:56.583 --> 07:58.584
Tom, it's important to
meet with the park rangers.

07:58.652 --> 08:00.586
They are the first line of defense.

08:00.654 --> 08:04.023
- [sighs]
- [loud voice] leslie knope!

08:04.090 --> 08:06.725
- Hey, carl.
- What's up, pencil pushers?

08:06.793 --> 08:08.260
Haverford. Good to see you, man.

08:08.328 --> 08:09.695
[laughs]

08:09.763 --> 08:11.897
Is it hot in here? I feel hot.

08:11.965 --> 08:14.133
Are you guys hot?
How you guys doing? I'm good.

08:14.201 --> 08:15.668
You guys got any snacks?

08:15.735 --> 08:18.737
Carl is the head of
all outdoor security.

08:18.805 --> 08:21.640
Why was he transferred from
his indoor desk job, you ask.

08:21.708 --> 08:22.875
Listen. - It's so sweet.

08:22.943 --> 08:25.077
<i>Hey, leslie, have you seen avatar?</i>

08:25.145 --> 08:27.079
<i>I never saw avatar.</i>

08:27.147 --> 08:28.747
I wanted to read the book first,

08:28.815 --> 08:32.418
<i>But then I realized there's no
book version of avatar.</i>

08:32.486 --> 08:34.320
What'd you guys do for st.
Patty's day?

08:34.386 --> 08:37.423
I was wearing this t-shirt that said,
"kiss me. I'm irish."

08:37.491 --> 08:38.924
But no one would kiss me.

08:41.666 --> 08:43.967
So you're too important for me

08:44.034 --> 08:45.802
Until one of your
own gets attacked.

08:46.170 --> 08:49.172
I just feel like
there's more we can do

08:49.240 --> 08:50.540
To keep the parks safe.

08:50.608 --> 08:52.942
Oh, you think you
know how to do my job?

08:53.010 --> 08:54.210
Well, you might not be so confident

08:54.278 --> 08:57.614
Once you've walked a
mile in my size sevens.

08:57.681 --> 08:59.082
Kind of small feet.

08:59.149 --> 09:01.384
Actually, seven is
the worldwide average.

09:01.452 --> 09:03.686
- Boom!
- Hup!

09:05.155 --> 09:07.323
Welcome to the emergency
self-defense class.

09:07.391 --> 09:09.425
I'll be showing you how
to escape from a variety

09:09.493 --> 09:10.893
Of situations

09:10.961 --> 09:12.929
While inflicting maximum damage

09:12.997 --> 09:14.297
On your attackers.

09:14.365 --> 09:16.132
Ron, do you think that
maybe I should put mark

09:16.200 --> 09:17.467
In a headlock?

09:17.534 --> 09:20.236
That way I can show everyone
how to escape a pervert.

09:20.304 --> 09:23.006
In the scenario
you just laid out,

09:23.073 --> 09:24.140
You're the pervert.

09:24.208 --> 09:25.241
You understand that, right?

09:25.309 --> 09:27.543
- [scoffs] you wish.
- Enough.

09:27.611 --> 09:29.078
I'm gonna start off simple

09:29.146 --> 09:33.750
And demonstrate how to extract
oneself from a wrist grab.

09:33.817 --> 09:36.452
Andy, ann, step up here.

09:36.520 --> 09:38.588
I watch a lot of lifetime movies.

09:38.656 --> 09:41.324
<i>There was this one,
how far is too far enough:</i>

09:41.392 --> 09:43.259
<i>The teri palliber lonergan story.</i>

09:43.327 --> 09:44.661
This woman had agoraphobia,

09:44.728 --> 09:46.229
And her therapist was
obsessed with her.

09:46.297 --> 09:48.631
And he hid in her house,
and then he attacked her

09:48.699 --> 09:50.333
And tried to eat her toes.

09:50.401 --> 09:52.935
Also, her daughter was
having sex way too young.

09:53.003 --> 09:58.441
So yeah, free self-defense
class, I'm there.

09:58.509 --> 10:00.043
- And just twist your weight.
- [yells]

10:00.110 --> 10:01.444
Oh. - Very good.

10:01.512 --> 10:02.612
Very good. Well done.

10:02.680 --> 10:05.181
Oh, what's up now, mugger?

10:05.249 --> 10:06.683
Ann, that was awesome.
That was really good.

10:08.786 --> 10:10.119
I don't know, leslie.

10:10.187 --> 10:11.788
I'd rather be back at the office.

10:11.855 --> 10:13.823
I know this is
painful for you, jerry,

10:13.891 --> 10:16.759
But you have to be strong.

10:16.827 --> 10:19.395
You guys ready?

10:19.463 --> 10:21.731
Oh, boy, yeah. Okay, we're ready.

10:21.799 --> 10:22.999
I'm gonna show you guys

10:23.067 --> 10:24.967
All the problems we've been facing.

10:25.035 --> 10:27.503
I'm gonna show you we've
been doing everything we can.

10:27.571 --> 10:29.505
I'm looking forward to
working together, carl.

10:29.573 --> 10:32.041
And after that, I'm gonna
show you this log I found.

10:32.109 --> 10:35.345
It's got, like, 50 worms on it.

10:35.412 --> 10:38.681
I call it worm log.

10:38.749 --> 10:40.917
Yeah, I've always been a
bit of an outdoorsman.

10:40.984 --> 10:43.252
Uh, when I was a kid,
my parents used to make me hang out

10:43.320 --> 10:45.221
In the backyard a lot
and just run around

10:45.289 --> 10:47.023
Till I got tired.

10:47.091 --> 10:48.925
But if there's any criminals
out there watching,

10:48.992 --> 10:51.694
I never get tired.

10:51.762 --> 10:53.930
And ladies too.

10:56.066 --> 10:57.433
This thing is a mess.

10:57.501 --> 10:59.369
We used to have
three carts actually.

10:59.436 --> 11:02.338
The first one got pushed
into the creek by some kids.

11:02.406 --> 11:04.741
The second one raccoons got onto.

11:04.808 --> 11:06.342
There was urine everywhere.

11:06.410 --> 11:08.511
And the third one
was recently stolen.

11:08.579 --> 11:09.846
What's this one?

11:09.913 --> 11:13.549
This is the second one.
The raccoon piss one.

11:13.617 --> 11:16.419
All right, so we're
gonna just head out.

11:16.487 --> 11:18.721
[screeching]

11:18.789 --> 11:20.356
Oh, no.

11:20.424 --> 11:22.325
You know what, I think
we got too much weight.

11:23.861 --> 11:25.695
Oh. That's tom probably.

11:25.763 --> 11:27.764
Are you serious?

11:27.831 --> 11:29.198
Tom, can you get off please?

11:29.266 --> 11:31.701
Just run alongside the cart, okay?

11:31.769 --> 11:32.869
Okay, here we go.

11:32.936 --> 11:34.370
Whoa.

11:34.438 --> 11:37.006
So let me tell you a
little bit about the park.

11:37.074 --> 11:38.408
Up here on the left

11:38.475 --> 11:41.244
Is one of our most
beautiful grass fields.

11:41.311 --> 11:44.180
Uh, it's primarily grass.

11:44.248 --> 11:45.615
All right, I'm gonna
make a hard left here.

11:45.682 --> 11:47.784
Stick with us, tom.

11:47.851 --> 11:50.486
Okay. Lesson learned.

11:50.554 --> 11:51.587
[applause] thank you.

11:51.655 --> 11:56.426
Next, andy. Impressive.

11:56.493 --> 11:58.995
I'm going to engage
andy in an attack hold,

11:59.062 --> 12:00.096
And he's gonna try and break free.

12:00.164 --> 12:01.464
Cool.

12:01.532 --> 12:03.099
Now I don't want to hurt you, ron.

12:03.167 --> 12:05.435
Don't worry about that.
Just try to escape my attack.

12:05.502 --> 12:09.405
Now when I get out,
am I allowed to counterstrike?

12:09.473 --> 12:12.442
Sure. When you get out,

12:12.509 --> 12:13.776
You may counterattack.

12:13.844 --> 12:16.245
But just promise
me you'll be ready

12:16.313 --> 12:20.082
Because, I mean,
I don't want to destroy you.

12:20.150 --> 12:21.517
Okay.

12:21.585 --> 12:25.655
I see where we're going with this.

12:25.722 --> 12:27.290
Now when your arms are
pinned to your sides,

12:27.357 --> 12:29.091
Use your legs to break free

12:29.159 --> 12:31.594
Instead of your neck,
which is what andy's trying to do.

12:34.031 --> 12:36.199
Okay, hold on. [shouts]

12:36.266 --> 12:37.400
Let him go.

12:41.805 --> 12:44.507
Andy.

12:44.575 --> 12:46.809
- Oh, god.
- Oops.

12:46.877 --> 12:48.711
Any of this looking familiar?

12:48.779 --> 12:51.781
Yeah, it happened
right over there.

12:51.849 --> 12:53.783
Oh, yeah, I'm not surprised.

12:53.851 --> 12:55.952
Take a look at this path.

12:56.019 --> 12:59.155
With budget cuts, we can't
afford a single safety light.

12:59.223 --> 13:01.457
There's been ten assaults
already this year.

13:01.525 --> 13:04.026
Wow. Really? Can't you
station a park ranger

13:04.094 --> 13:05.461
Out here? - We have.

13:05.529 --> 13:06.963
[shouting] who do you
think they're assaulting?

13:07.030 --> 13:09.332
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to yell.

13:09.399 --> 13:10.666
One way or another,

13:10.734 --> 13:13.069
I'm gonna get money so
you can protect jerry

13:13.136 --> 13:15.805
And all the other helpless,
pathetic people in this town.

13:15.873 --> 13:18.074
[breathing heavily]

13:18.141 --> 13:20.476
You guys got to slow down.

13:20.544 --> 13:21.611
Can I just take a
rest for a minute?

13:21.678 --> 13:23.179
No, tom. Sorry. No can do.

13:23.247 --> 13:24.847
Sun's going down.
It's real dangerous out here.

13:24.915 --> 13:28.784
Let's roll, carl.
Okay, going fast.

13:28.852 --> 13:30.853
[grumbles]

13:30.921 --> 13:32.488
Okay, what day is it today?

13:32.556 --> 13:33.990
I don't know.

13:34.057 --> 13:36.325
Okay, but to be fair,
you never know.

13:36.393 --> 13:37.460
That's kind of true.

13:37.528 --> 13:40.997
I'm super bad at days.

13:41.064 --> 13:42.865
But honestly I'm fine.

13:42.933 --> 13:45.768
Sorry I squeezed your
lights out there, son.

13:45.836 --> 13:48.871
No worries. Will you show me
how to do that move, though?

13:48.939 --> 13:49.972
Sure. I can teach you right now.

13:50.040 --> 13:51.274
No, no, no.

13:51.341 --> 13:52.842
Andy, you should really
just take it easy, I think.

13:52.910 --> 13:55.411
Do you want some more water
or maybe some pancakes?

13:55.479 --> 13:57.580
No, no, no. I'm fine.

13:57.648 --> 13:58.781
Thank you though.

13:58.849 --> 14:00.483
What's the first
move in any fight?

14:00.551 --> 14:02.018
Punch to the balls.

14:02.085 --> 14:04.954
We've all heard the old saying,

14:05.022 --> 14:06.956
"parks are supposed to be fun,"

14:07.024 --> 14:09.559
But sometimes muggers
have their own ideas.

14:09.626 --> 14:11.894
Leslie knope is with us again

14:11.962 --> 14:14.530
From the parks department. Leslie.

14:14.598 --> 14:16.566
Tell us your story.

14:16.633 --> 14:18.768
This is my coworker
jerry gergich,

14:18.835 --> 14:22.538
Diabetic, sloppily out of shape,

14:22.606 --> 14:24.106
Friend.

14:24.174 --> 14:27.310
He was mugged this
morning in ramsett park.

14:27.377 --> 14:30.613
Who's next? Your frumpy uncle?

14:30.681 --> 14:32.448
Your simple neighbor?

14:32.516 --> 14:35.384
Your unpopular coworker?

14:35.452 --> 14:38.387
Head of security carl
lorthner is doing his best

14:38.455 --> 14:40.323
To keep the parks safe,
but he's failing.

14:40.390 --> 14:42.825
So what is the
solution to fix this?

14:42.893 --> 14:47.163
To make it right and not bad?

14:47.230 --> 14:49.865
We need money from city hall,

14:49.933 --> 14:51.133
And it's not coming through.

14:51.201 --> 14:53.970
And, pawnee, I am sorry to say this

14:54.037 --> 14:55.838
But your government is failing you.

14:55.906 --> 15:00.242
Up next, ten objects you
didn't know you can eat.

15:00.310 --> 15:03.746
What possessed you to do that?

15:03.814 --> 15:04.880
I'm sorry, paul,

15:04.948 --> 15:06.816
But one of my guys got
mugged in the park.

15:06.883 --> 15:09.418
I don't care how upset you are,

15:09.486 --> 15:12.588
You do not badmouth your
own government on tv.

15:12.656 --> 15:15.358
I'm sure you'll be happy to know

15:15.425 --> 15:16.659
Your little stunt worked.

15:16.727 --> 15:19.428
The mayor's going to divert $2,500

15:19.496 --> 15:22.365
To the parks for security upgrades.

15:22.432 --> 15:24.266
There's going to be an
announcement tomorrow

15:24.334 --> 15:27.269
At 10:00 in the press room,
so make sure

15:27.337 --> 15:29.605
You bring the doofus
that got his ass kicked.

15:29.673 --> 15:31.040
I don't know who
you're referring to.

15:31.108 --> 15:32.708
We treat everyone with
respect around here.

15:33.710 --> 15:35.945
[softly] okay.

15:36.013 --> 15:37.947
[clears throat] good morning.

15:38.015 --> 15:39.448
As many of you know,

15:39.516 --> 15:43.719
There was an incident involving
a government employee

15:43.787 --> 15:45.521
In ramsett park.

15:45.589 --> 15:46.589
Jerry, are you nervous?

15:46.657 --> 15:48.958
Just talk about how
hard it was for you.

15:49.026 --> 15:51.227
Speak from the heart.
You'll be fine.

15:51.294 --> 15:55.031
Leslie, I wasn't mugged.

15:55.098 --> 15:56.432
-...Safety of our citizens.

15:56.500 --> 15:57.700
That's why we're here today,
to give pawnee...

15:59.708 --> 16:00.909
Jerry, why don't
you step on up here?

16:00.976 --> 16:04.979
No, no, I will get up here.

16:05.547 --> 16:07.481
I'm gonna speak for jerry.

16:07.549 --> 16:12.052
He can't talk right now because
he has hysterical muteness.

16:12.120 --> 16:13.788
From trauma. - Correct.

16:13.855 --> 16:16.123
Jerry.

16:16.191 --> 16:18.025
What about this? Is this fake?

16:18.093 --> 16:19.527
Huh? Is this fake? - This is real.

16:19.594 --> 16:21.228
I really dislocated my shoulder.

16:21.296 --> 16:23.063
Were you even in
the park yesterday?

16:23.131 --> 16:25.399
Look, I was on my way
to feed the hummingbirds,

16:25.467 --> 16:28.169
And I stopped for a
breakfast burrito.

16:28.236 --> 16:29.770
- The farting.
- Yeah.

16:29.838 --> 16:31.906
And, lord sheldon,
he lunged at a bird,

16:31.973 --> 16:35.309
I dropped the burrito,
and it lands on a log in the creek.

16:35.377 --> 16:36.677
So I go to reach for it,
I lose my balance,

16:36.745 --> 16:38.546
And I fall on my
shoulder really weird.

16:38.613 --> 16:40.548
Well, why didn't you just
tell everybody the truth?

16:40.615 --> 16:41.649
Are you kidding me?

16:41.716 --> 16:45.052
Imagine what tom would have said.

16:45.120 --> 16:48.055
[as tom] damn, jerry,
you jumped in a creek for a burrito?

16:48.123 --> 16:49.590
What would you do
for a klondike bar?

16:49.658 --> 16:51.258
Kill your wife?

16:51.326 --> 16:54.662
Block the opponent's punch
and counterpunch to the jaw.

16:54.729 --> 16:57.431
Whooh. Shoeshine?

16:57.499 --> 16:59.266
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

16:59.334 --> 17:01.335
Ann perkins in the shoe shouse.

17:01.403 --> 17:03.170
[laughs]

17:03.238 --> 17:04.305
I wanted to check in.

17:04.372 --> 17:05.439
I brought some stuff
from the hospital--

17:05.507 --> 17:08.509
Water, compress, aspirin,
some lollipops.

17:08.577 --> 17:09.577
I know you love those.

17:09.644 --> 17:10.810
You know, hey, thank you,

17:10.878 --> 17:12.378
But I'm really-- I'm feeling great.

17:12.446 --> 17:13.547
I took a couple of aspirin

17:13.615 --> 17:14.815
And slept right through the night

17:14.883 --> 17:15.883
And-- hold on a second.

17:15.951 --> 17:18.185
Uh, ludgate! What the hell?

17:18.252 --> 17:20.221
I got you one of
those veggie muffins

17:20.288 --> 17:21.387
That you're always eating. - Score.

17:21.455 --> 17:23.357
Yeah. Tastes like a rug.

17:23.425 --> 17:25.192
Shut up.

17:25.260 --> 17:27.094
[protests indistinctly] anyhow.

17:27.162 --> 17:28.929
Good, well, I'm glad
you're feeling better.

17:28.997 --> 17:30.231
I am. Thank you for that.

17:30.298 --> 17:32.533
That's so cool.

17:32.601 --> 17:34.001
Since when did he
start doing stuff

17:34.069 --> 17:35.803
For other people?

17:35.871 --> 17:39.540
Now I actually am worried that
something happened to his brain.

17:39.608 --> 17:42.610
People change, I guess.

17:42.677 --> 17:45.379
Wouldn't you rather the money
go to keeping the parks safe?

17:45.447 --> 17:47.915
Yes, but now we have the
money under false pretences.

17:47.983 --> 17:50.384
I actually think that you have
a bigger problem than the money.

17:50.452 --> 17:52.086
What?

17:52.153 --> 17:54.188
There is someone in your
department who is willing to lie

17:54.256 --> 17:57.057
About being mugged because
he's afraid of his coworkers.

17:57.125 --> 17:58.759
[cell phone rings]

17:58.827 --> 18:01.695
Knope. Yup.

18:01.763 --> 18:02.830
No!

18:05.233 --> 18:06.901
Carl, what are you doing here?

18:06.968 --> 18:08.569
Oh, leslie.

18:08.637 --> 18:11.038
Well, since you decided
to drag my name

18:11.106 --> 18:13.641
Through the mud on tv,
I figured why not return the favor?

18:13.708 --> 18:15.376
Carl, could you
quietly quiet down

18:15.443 --> 18:18.412
For a second and please tell
me what's going on quietly?

18:18.480 --> 18:21.282
Okay? In a quiet voice.

18:21.349 --> 18:23.217
[loud as usual] a
citizen handed in

18:23.285 --> 18:25.486
A very interesting
home video that I think

18:25.554 --> 18:28.622
The people of pawnee will
find very interesting.

18:28.690 --> 18:31.191
Take a peek at this.

18:31.259 --> 18:33.360
[flatulence]

18:33.428 --> 18:37.164
Keep your eyes on the creek.

18:37.232 --> 18:38.933
There he is.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.801
Oh, this is my favorite part.

18:40.869 --> 18:44.004
Not willing to share with a dog.

18:44.072 --> 18:46.073
So it would appear
that park security

18:46.141 --> 18:47.841
Was not to blame after all.

18:47.909 --> 18:51.211
Okay, look, I have a
proposition for you.

18:51.279 --> 18:54.014
Fine. I'll have sex with
you in exchange for the tape.

18:54.082 --> 18:56.951
That's not what I'm saying! Okay?

18:57.018 --> 19:00.788
Just listen to what I have to say.

19:00.855 --> 19:04.558
The ramsett park
mugging story continues

19:04.626 --> 19:06.493
With a shiny new twist.

19:06.561 --> 19:10.631
Ranger carl lorthner is here today.

19:10.699 --> 19:14.568
Now I understand that
you have a bombshell

19:14.636 --> 19:18.172
To drop that you are
just sitting on.

19:18.239 --> 19:20.140
Yes, that's correct.

19:20.208 --> 19:21.976
I came on today because I have

19:22.043 --> 19:24.211
Some very important
information to share.

19:24.279 --> 19:26.814
<i>I finally saw avatar,</i>

19:26.881 --> 19:29.350
And I thought it
lived up to the hype.

19:29.417 --> 19:32.486
Wow, I'm not sure what that
has to do with the mugging.

19:32.554 --> 19:34.121
[laughs]

19:34.189 --> 19:36.523
Um, leslie, counterpoint.

19:36.591 --> 19:37.992
I disagree with carl.

19:38.059 --> 19:41.161
<i>- Okay.
- I have seen avatar as well.</i>

19:41.229 --> 19:43.497
And I think it exceeded the hype.

19:43.565 --> 19:46.500
- What?
- Oh, boy.

19:46.568 --> 19:48.936
We... - Disagreement.

19:49.004 --> 19:51.572
[sighs] well, things are
really heating up in here.

19:51.640 --> 19:52.606
Aren't they?

19:52.674 --> 19:54.541
We should probably take some calls.

19:54.609 --> 19:57.911
That segment was a disaster!

19:57.979 --> 19:59.780
Don't you ever [bleep]
me like that again.

19:59.848 --> 20:02.116
<i>This is pawnee [bleep] today.</i>

20:02.183 --> 20:03.684
Do you know that I bumped a cat

20:03.752 --> 20:06.120
That can stand up on
its hinders for you?

20:06.187 --> 20:08.455
You disgust me, knope.
Get out of my sight.

20:08.523 --> 20:10.891
- Yes, ma'am.
- Go.

20:10.959 --> 20:12.960
Go. No, no, no.

20:13.028 --> 20:14.695
Don't make me chase you.

20:14.763 --> 20:15.963
You want to go eat something.

20:16.031 --> 20:17.631
[softly] okay.

20:17.699 --> 20:19.299
I am part of a great team.

20:19.367 --> 20:23.737
And sometimes the best way
to maintain a strong team

20:23.805 --> 20:25.873
Is just by letting someone know
that he is still a part of it.

20:25.940 --> 20:28.208
Okay. This is the only copy.

20:28.276 --> 20:31.679
And I am going to destroy it.

20:31.746 --> 20:34.882
Right after I watch
it one more time.

20:34.949 --> 20:38.352
I'm sorry, but it is so good.

20:39.910 --> 20:40.876
- Hey, jerry.
- Mm-hmm.

20:41.544 --> 20:42.978
I got you a peppermint latte.

20:43.045 --> 20:45.480
Seriously?

20:45.548 --> 20:47.315
My goodness. I love a pepp--

20:47.383 --> 20:48.984
I know.

20:49.051 --> 20:52.788
Ah, jeez. Go ahead.

20:52.855 --> 20:55.223
We should just directly apply
the food to your clothes.

20:55.291 --> 20:57.559
[laughter] - yay!

20:57.627 --> 21:00.295
Making fun of jerry's back.

21:00.363 --> 21:01.897
They can laugh at
me all they want.

21:01.964 --> 21:04.432
Because two more
years until I retire

21:04.500 --> 21:06.201
With full benefits and pension.

21:06.269 --> 21:07.636
And my wife and I, we have bought

21:07.703 --> 21:08.904
A little cottage on a lake.

21:08.971 --> 21:10.238
And I am going to get myself

21:10.306 --> 21:13.208
A stack of mystery novels,
a box of cigars,

21:13.276 --> 21:16.812
And I am going to sit
back and enjoy my life.

21:16.879 --> 21:19.915
Hey, jerry, April was just
double-checking the lunch order.

21:19.982 --> 21:22.150
Do you want the
salmon or the twout?

21:22.218 --> 21:23.086
Twout! Both: Twout! Twout! Twout!

21:23.087 --> 21:26.087
