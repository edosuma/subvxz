WEBVTT

00:07.563 --> 00:08.959
I'm sure
they'll be back soon.

00:09.027 --> 00:11.318
- You can count on it.
- What?

00:11.899 --> 00:13.742
Oh! That's probably them.

00:14.165 --> 00:17.239
Ha! Remember
the old saying, kids.

00:17.307 --> 00:18.740
"Beans, beans,
the magical fruit,

00:18.808 --> 00:20.787
just plant your beans
then grab some loot."

00:20.855 --> 00:23.340
Man, I've been saying
that rhyme all wrong.

00:27.059 --> 00:28.315
Don't worry, Uncle Scrooge.

00:28.383 --> 00:30.568
We'll take this so you don't
throw out your old man back.

00:30.636 --> 00:33.037
Nice try, lad,
but you know the drill.

00:33.105 --> 00:34.684
"All money goes to the bin..."

00:34.752 --> 00:36.791
"Not next of kin."

00:40.237 --> 00:41.510
Beakley!

00:43.000 --> 00:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:50.426 --> 00:52.228
Your board of directors called.

00:52.296 --> 00:53.629
They say your recent adventures

00:53.697 --> 00:56.646
are causing costly damages
to the city of Duckburg.

00:58.638 --> 01:00.610
Which I always pay for!

01:00.678 --> 01:02.522
Adventure leads to treasure,

01:02.590 --> 01:04.015
treasure helps the company,

01:04.083 --> 01:06.158
the company helps the town
through appreciating investments

01:06.226 --> 01:07.964
in long-term
civic fiduciary interests.

01:08.032 --> 01:10.168
Yes, what's not to understand?

01:10.236 --> 01:12.873
The board has set up a television
interview with Roxanne Featherly

01:12.941 --> 01:14.592
to help "boost your character."

01:14.660 --> 01:17.094
My character
does not need boosting.

01:17.197 --> 01:18.549
They're overreacting.

01:18.617 --> 01:19.781
Good news, Mr. McDee!

01:19.788 --> 01:22.037
The beanstalk
missed the orphanage!

01:22.971 --> 01:26.344
Uh... what time
is the interview?

01:27.583 --> 01:28.974
Ah.

01:38.871 --> 01:40.793
Oh! Lena!

01:40.871 --> 01:42.812
Yeah,
I'm not really a hugger.

01:42.920 --> 01:44.422
Oh, yeah, no, me neither.

01:44.490 --> 01:46.860
Hugs are, like,
whatever or whatever, huh.

01:47.546 --> 01:48.935
Are you excited
for our sleepover?

01:49.007 --> 01:51.390
We're gonna brush our
teeth, go to bed on time,

01:51.458 --> 01:52.538
wake up in the middle
of the night

01:52.605 --> 01:54.492
confused saying, "Where am I?"

01:54.560 --> 01:57.017
Oh, that's right.
I'm at the best sleepover ever!"

01:57.085 --> 01:59.366
Mm, so this is
your first sleepover?

01:59.524 --> 02:01.133
Yeah. Last one up the stairs

02:01.201 --> 02:02.915
has to brush their teeth twice!

02:03.059 --> 02:04.264
Hup! Huh!

03:26.566 --> 03:28.675
Huh! Nuh! Guh!

03:28.886 --> 03:31.504
Did you know there's a
military-grade bedsheet tuck-in

03:31.572 --> 03:33.656
that's often used
as an interrogation technique?

03:34.060 --> 03:35.069
Bathroom?

03:35.137 --> 03:36.579
Down the hall, on the left.

03:39.539 --> 03:40.624
Aah!

03:40.824 --> 03:42.419
Aunt Magica.

03:43.911 --> 03:46.872
The home of Scrooge McDuck
is safe no more!

03:46.940 --> 03:47.960
What do we do first?

03:48.035 --> 03:50.678
My current plan is make
popcorn, watch a movie,

03:50.746 --> 03:52.848
and then Webby really wants us
to brush our teeth.

03:52.916 --> 03:55.108
Dental hygiene can wait!

03:55.187 --> 03:56.443
I can feel my powers growing

03:56.511 --> 03:59.586
the closer I get to Scrooge's
precious Number One Dime.

03:59.654 --> 04:01.407
Listen to this:

04:04.637 --> 04:06.383
The amulet thing
is already in the bin.

04:06.451 --> 04:08.280
So I just hang out here
and wait, right?

04:08.385 --> 04:10.841
Ugh! You wait here
while the Hunter's Stone

04:10.909 --> 04:12.352
searches for Scrooge's dime.

04:12.430 --> 04:13.740
It will bring the dime to you,

04:13.820 --> 04:15.280
you will bring the dime to me,

04:15.348 --> 04:17.594
and I will unleash
its secret mysterious power,

04:17.661 --> 04:19.228
striking from
within his very home

04:19.310 --> 04:22.760
and laying my grim vengeance
upon Scrooge McDuck!

04:22.871 --> 04:25.742
Mm, mm-hmm. So, just hang out
here and wait, right?

04:25.810 --> 04:27.738
Could you please try to care

04:27.806 --> 04:29.357
about our
centuries-old blood feud?

04:29.425 --> 04:30.930
You know what I care about.

04:30.998 --> 04:33.383
Bleck. Fine. Whatever.

04:33.541 --> 04:35.265
Do this and I'll grant you

04:35.333 --> 04:37.904
your dark
heart's fondest desire.

04:37.972 --> 04:39.286
Unless you're
too busy hanging out

04:39.353 --> 04:40.941
with Pinky McHappyBow
over there.

04:41.009 --> 04:42.716
Relax, it's just an act.

04:42.784 --> 04:45.595
The lunar eclipse is soon
at hand, you little whelp!

04:46.008 --> 04:47.296
Don't trust them, Lena.

04:47.298 --> 04:48.591
They'd turn on you in an instant

04:48.659 --> 04:51.101
if they knew
what you really are.

04:52.429 --> 04:54.947
Tell me where the warheads are!

04:55.514 --> 04:57.394
We're not done here.

05:00.167 --> 05:02.026
I made us matching
friendship bracelets!

05:02.121 --> 05:03.495
Mmm, thanks.

05:03.572 --> 05:05.727
Hey, what's
this board all about?

05:05.909 --> 05:08.933
This is all the info I collected
about the McDuck family.

05:09.003 --> 05:10.913
Family tree,
articles of importance,

05:10.981 --> 05:12.488
lifelong foes...

05:12.490 --> 05:14.046
It says here
Scrooge hates magic.

05:14.181 --> 05:15.507
Oh, yeah, all kinds.

05:15.584 --> 05:17.648
Curses, incantations,
card tricks.

05:17.716 --> 05:20.348
He says magic is a supernatural
shortcut for hard work.

05:20.416 --> 05:23.784
He won't even allow
any spell books in the house.

05:24.900 --> 05:26.945
Wanna see what I snuck
into the house?

05:30.565 --> 05:32.668
<i>The Grimoire Du Merlock.</i>

05:32.747 --> 05:34.391
An ancient book of magic.

05:34.459 --> 05:37.677
Ever wonder what dark forces
loom in the shadows,

05:37.745 --> 05:39.698
waiting for the right time
to pounce?

05:39.775 --> 05:42.126
Uh, no.
Can't say that I have.

05:42.202 --> 05:44.159
Ooh! We should try some spells.

05:44.227 --> 05:45.296
No! Ahem.

05:45.372 --> 05:47.527
Uh, how about we play a game?

05:47.605 --> 05:48.893
According to an article
I read about

05:48.960 --> 05:50.142
slumber parties online,

05:50.210 --> 05:51.714
the perfect sleepover game is...

05:51.782 --> 05:52.619
Pillow fight!

05:52.696 --> 05:53.515
- Huh?
- Huh?

05:53.583 --> 05:54.583
Unh!

05:55.866 --> 05:57.290
- Hiyah!
- Yah! Yah!

05:57.359 --> 05:58.582
I regret everything!

05:58.650 --> 05:59.824
Aah! You Win!

06:00.197 --> 06:01.887
Get out, get out, get out!

06:04.883 --> 06:06.918
Why would we pick
a fight with Webby?

06:07.570 --> 06:09.664
Oh! Grab your swim trunks, boys!

06:09.732 --> 06:11.646
I know
how to salvage the night.

06:12.775 --> 06:16.217
So, Roxanne, I suppose
my greatest weakness

06:16.285 --> 06:18.616
is that I care too much.

06:18.684 --> 06:19.864
Fascinating.

06:19.932 --> 06:21.895
Well, Mr. McDuck,
I can assure you

06:21.963 --> 06:23.519
that
you will not come off

06:23.587 --> 06:25.327
"likable" doing any of that.

06:25.396 --> 06:27.082
Unfold those arms.
Drop the frown.

06:27.150 --> 06:29.286
"When dealing
with the press, S.O.S."

06:29.354 --> 06:32.763
Be sincere,
open, and smile!

06:33.001 --> 06:35.917
Some find my scowl
very appealing.

06:35.995 --> 06:36.890
Aah!

06:36.958 --> 06:40.139
The press are vultures looking
for the next story to feast on.

06:40.207 --> 06:42.753
I can handle
a puff-piece reporter.

06:42.821 --> 06:44.461
Fine, I'll go easy on you.

06:44.529 --> 06:47.309
Now, Mr. McDuck,
I love your accent.

06:47.377 --> 06:50.884
Tell me, what part
of <i> Ireland</i> are you from?

07:07.356 --> 07:09.274
Up next to
the diving board is Dewey Duck,

07:09.323 --> 07:11.282
representing
the proud country of Dew-donia.

07:11.350 --> 07:12.290
When asked if he was concerned

07:12.358 --> 07:13.624
about the possibly
injuring himself

07:13.692 --> 07:16.783
on the cold hard cash below,
he simply replied, "Nerp!"

07:17.008 --> 07:18.660
We hold now
for his national anthem.

07:18.728 --> 07:22.396
<i>♪ Oh Dew-donia,
land of the few ♪</i>

07:22.503 --> 07:26.590
<i>♪ Home of the duck,
clothed all in bluuuuue! ♪</i>

07:28.018 --> 07:29.808
Dewey Duck makes his approach.

07:29.927 --> 07:31.664
Word has it he's got a new move:

07:31.732 --> 07:33.557
The triple corks-Dew.

07:35.496 --> 07:38.593
Nailed it!

07:38.728 --> 07:40.182
Aaaah!

07:48.854 --> 07:50.581
Okay, it's been 20 minutes.

07:50.649 --> 07:52.258
Let me show you
how it's done. Truth.

07:52.326 --> 07:55.144
Okay! What's your deepest,
darkest secret?

07:55.255 --> 07:57.132
Uh, mmm, dare.

08:02.057 --> 08:04.829
Dewey was eaten by a magical
money shark in the Bin!

08:05.948 --> 08:07.658
What?
I'm really good at charades.

08:07.767 --> 08:09.066
It's just swimming
around in there!

08:09.133 --> 08:11.041
Eating money!
And children! And money!

08:11.112 --> 08:12.404
We have to tell, Mr. McDuck.

08:12.472 --> 08:13.181
- No!
- No!

08:13.249 --> 08:16.614
We... might have snuck into the
Money Bin without permission.

08:16.724 --> 08:19.156
You realize getting your
brother eaten is way worse.

08:19.224 --> 08:20.098
Louie's right.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.150
If we tell Scrooge
they snuck into the Bin,

08:22.218 --> 08:24.255
Scrooge'll feed them
to the shark himself.

08:24.364 --> 08:25.956
Well, we need do something!

08:26.033 --> 08:28.071
We need to take care
of it ourselves.

08:28.139 --> 08:29.649
Don't you trust me?

08:30.378 --> 08:32.528
Okay. But if there's
a monster in the Bin,

08:32.596 --> 08:34.482
we need a way to keep safe
while looking for it.

08:34.551 --> 08:35.654
- Like a boat?
- But how do we get

08:35.721 --> 08:37.164
a boat
into the money bin?

08:37.340 --> 08:39.159
My best friend Dewey's
in trouble!

08:39.251 --> 08:40.417
I can feel it.

09:00.386 --> 09:01.717
Now what do we do?

09:02.274 --> 09:03.606
We wait.

09:10.445 --> 09:12.072
You lure real sharks with chum,

09:12.152 --> 09:13.587
so logically we should be able

09:13.655 --> 09:15.615
to lure a money shark
with expensive stuff.

09:15.683 --> 09:19.062
Mmm, so long,
future inheritance.

09:25.154 --> 09:27.516
Ha ha!
I would never have thought

09:27.584 --> 09:29.439
to feed Scrooge's family
to the Hunter's Stone

09:29.532 --> 09:31.681
<i>before</i> it ushers about
his destruction.

09:31.749 --> 09:33.660
Well, done, Lena!

09:34.604 --> 09:37.551
Next time you give me an amulet
that turns into a monster,

09:37.619 --> 09:39.096
I'd appreciate
a little heads up.

09:39.164 --> 09:40.900
That monster has a name.

09:40.968 --> 09:42.821
Show Tiffany some respect!

09:43.400 --> 09:45.806
Are you wearing a
colorful personalized bracelet?

09:46.230 --> 09:48.014
It's not that colorful.

09:48.941 --> 09:53.198
Oh my sweet,
dumb, dumb little Lena,

09:53.266 --> 09:55.220
you're being
the worst fool of all:

09:55.300 --> 09:57.118
A sentimental fool.

09:57.186 --> 09:59.116
You're actually trying
to help them.

09:59.192 --> 10:00.850
No. I had to do something

10:00.926 --> 10:02.681
to keep them from
getting Scrooge involved.

10:02.768 --> 10:06.041
And I'm sorry if I don't wanna
be killed by a money shark!

10:06.135 --> 10:09.108
I doubt the sincerity
of your apology!

10:09.176 --> 10:10.508
Now get out there and stall

10:10.542 --> 10:11.938
while Tiffany accumulates mass.

10:12.006 --> 10:13.329
Wait. It's gonna get bigger?

10:13.397 --> 10:16.801
Oh, she's going to get
really big and really mad

10:16.869 --> 10:18.253
until she gets that dime.

10:18.321 --> 10:20.673
Just don't get eaten until then.

10:20.903 --> 10:23.237
This is coming out of Dewey's
portion of the inheritance.

10:23.305 --> 10:24.387
Help!

10:29.173 --> 10:31.763
Did you know sharks
never run out of teeth?

10:31.831 --> 10:33.347
They have the most powerful
jaws on the planet.

10:33.414 --> 10:35.691
On average, there are
about 100 shark attacks a year.

10:35.759 --> 10:37.246
Dude, now is not the time!

10:37.314 --> 10:39.238
Facts comfort me
when I'm nervous!

10:39.316 --> 10:40.924
It's clearly a magical creature.

10:41.001 --> 10:42.686
So there's only one way
to defeat it:

10:42.812 --> 10:44.579
- Magic!
- Nope!

10:44.647 --> 10:46.353
It's a shark, and the
Junior Woodchuck Guide

10:46.420 --> 10:47.743
clearly states once a shark is...

10:47.811 --> 10:49.956
- Back!
- It's back. Look!

10:55.782 --> 10:57.261
I'm just gonna crash into it.

10:57.329 --> 10:58.641
No, Dewey's in there!

10:58.709 --> 10:59.991
Louie! Money bags!

11:11.589 --> 11:12.755
Gotcha!

11:15.426 --> 11:17.660
Ha ha ha! Stupid shark!

11:18.809 --> 11:19.809
Aah!

11:24.411 --> 11:25.757
Ya know, until the 16th century,

11:25.825 --> 11:28.243
sharks were referred
to as "sea dogs." Aaah!

11:28.687 --> 11:30.800
Whoa!
Dewey's brothers!

11:33.154 --> 11:35.975
There's the man of the hour!
Roxanne Featherly.

11:36.043 --> 11:38.978
It's an honor and privilege
to meet you, Mr. McDuck.

11:39.046 --> 11:40.335
Such a fan.

11:40.403 --> 11:42.899
When you forced Medusa
to take a good hard look

11:42.967 --> 11:44.897
at herself in the mirror,
it changed me.

11:44.965 --> 11:46.760
And her. Into stone.

11:48.902 --> 11:50.327
Most people
don't know about that.

11:50.404 --> 11:51.989
Well, most people aren't me.

11:52.057 --> 11:53.634
Now, don't worry, this interview

11:53.702 --> 11:56.365
is just the two of us
having a conversation.

12:00.573 --> 12:03.667
I'm here with multi-millionaire
menace Scrooge McDuck,

12:03.735 --> 12:06.171
who values profit
over people's lives.

12:06.239 --> 12:07.608
I'll take your awkward smile

12:07.676 --> 12:09.700
as a confirmation that you
enjoy feeling superior

12:09.768 --> 12:12.151
to everyone in the now-ravaged
town of Duckburg.

12:12.219 --> 12:13.872
- No, I...
- Now, Mr. McDuck,

12:13.940 --> 12:15.743
I can't quite place your accent.

12:15.856 --> 12:19.239
Tell me, what part
of <i> Ireland</i> are you from?

12:23.086 --> 12:24.466
I found a protection spell!

12:24.534 --> 12:26.235
We'll need a bunch
of herbs and a cauldron.

12:26.312 --> 12:30.413
Uh, grab that spice rack and, um,
that collectable popcorn bucket.

12:30.481 --> 12:32.197
Uh, I don't know, Webby.

12:32.265 --> 12:34.321
It's not good to mess
with this magic stuff.

12:34.389 --> 12:36.257
I'm pretty sure I got this.

12:37.469 --> 12:40.166
All evil energies
leave this space.

12:40.234 --> 12:41.906
Go back from whence you came,

12:41.974 --> 12:43.892
you get outta my face!

12:43.960 --> 12:45.501
Ugh, I hate Magic.

12:45.644 --> 12:46.712
You hold your tongue.

12:46.780 --> 12:48.802
Magic is the family business.

12:48.870 --> 12:50.729
And the more we use it,

12:50.800 --> 12:52.558
the more likely
I am to get caught.

12:52.626 --> 12:54.895
Don't need magic.
Need your wits.

12:54.963 --> 12:56.942
And some kind
of shark-stopping thing.

12:57.029 --> 12:58.082
And maybe a snack.

12:58.150 --> 12:59.352
Uh, Launchpad?

12:59.420 --> 13:01.056
Uh-oh.
Launchpad's hungry.

13:01.124 --> 13:02.204
Hungry for vengeance.

13:02.272 --> 13:03.492
Launchpad...

13:03.560 --> 13:05.722
Vengeance.
For Dewey!

13:05.985 --> 13:07.436
- Launchpad!
- Launchpad!

13:07.785 --> 13:09.061
Anyway, crash boat now?

13:09.129 --> 13:10.313
Yes! Or no!

13:10.411 --> 13:11.837
- Just go!
- Move!

13:17.427 --> 13:18.754
Nnn!

13:19.041 --> 13:20.153
- Oh!
- Oh!

13:21.239 --> 13:22.544
Nnn!

13:23.466 --> 13:25.102
I'm comin', Dewey!

13:25.332 --> 13:26.978
Aaah!

13:27.374 --> 13:28.597
Jump!

13:30.661 --> 13:32.638
Oh, hey, guys!

13:35.737 --> 13:38.763
Next time, we have
a sleepover at my house.

13:38.831 --> 13:41.659
With a rich Celtic tradition
connected to,

13:41.727 --> 13:45.591
but entirely distinct from the
rest of the United Kingdom!

13:45.669 --> 13:48.769
And, secondly,
I have done far more good

13:48.837 --> 13:50.350
than harm for Duckburg.

13:50.418 --> 13:51.423
Ask anyone!

13:51.491 --> 13:52.382
Will do.

13:52.450 --> 13:54.109
Joining us for comment
via satellite

13:54.177 --> 13:56.109
from his office
that was recently ravaged

13:56.177 --> 14:00.111
by Scrooge's blameworthy
beanstalk, Flintheart Glomgold.

14:00.254 --> 14:01.958
Curse you, McDuck!

14:02.042 --> 14:03.529
Roxanne, good to see you.

14:03.597 --> 14:04.656
And you.

14:04.724 --> 14:07.509
You can't believe this
tam o'shanter-wearing terror!

14:07.577 --> 14:08.584
Oh, shameful.

14:08.692 --> 14:11.544
<i>We can't all afford
top hats, you rich snob!</i>

14:11.612 --> 14:14.236
You're rich, too,
you malevolent mountebank!

14:14.304 --> 14:15.822
<i>You'd best believe it, Scroogey!</i>

14:15.890 --> 14:16.901
<i>I'm rolling in it!</i>

14:16.969 --> 14:19.266
Then what is your point?!

14:19.334 --> 14:22.141
I'm glad that beanstalk
crushed your office!

14:22.342 --> 14:23.366
Ohh!

14:23.596 --> 14:25.100
"Lena, do my bidding."

14:25.168 --> 14:27.554
Lena, find a tiny dime
in a sea of dimes.

14:27.622 --> 14:28.633
Lena, don't get mad

14:28.701 --> 14:30.509
"when my money shark
tries to eat you!"

14:30.577 --> 14:31.924
Lena, I found something!

14:31.992 --> 14:33.922
According to this, to
stop an enchanted force,

14:33.990 --> 14:35.892
you must remove its power source

14:35.977 --> 14:37.942
or beat it with
a stronger magical totem.

14:38.055 --> 14:39.626
We can use
our friendship bracelets!

14:39.694 --> 14:42.338
Friendship is
the greatest magic of all!

14:42.406 --> 14:44.110
That's not how magic works.

14:44.178 --> 14:46.251
But the shark is made of coins,

14:46.330 --> 14:49.004
so maybe if we can
find some kind of coin

14:49.072 --> 14:51.791
that holds a special
significance, we can stop it.

14:51.859 --> 14:53.882
Oh! Like Scrooge's
Number One Dime?

14:53.950 --> 14:55.838
Oh, is that a thing?

14:55.906 --> 14:58.480
Like, do you know
where it could be?

14:58.591 --> 15:00.561
Scrooge keeps it
in his pocket at all times.

15:00.688 --> 15:03.224
What?! The stupid dime
isn't even stupid in here?

15:03.338 --> 15:05.043
We need to get to Scrooge now.

15:05.111 --> 15:06.205
What are you doing?

15:06.273 --> 15:08.226
Our friendship
is all the magic we need.

15:08.294 --> 15:09.682
Don't you trust me?

15:10.539 --> 15:13.044
With the
hand of my best friend,

15:13.112 --> 15:16.165
we bring about
the money shark's end!

15:16.625 --> 15:18.651
Webby, stop!
It's not working!

15:18.739 --> 15:19.774
Just believe!

15:19.842 --> 15:20.978
Again, with feeling.

15:21.056 --> 15:23.341
With the hand of my best friend,

15:23.409 --> 15:26.011
we bring about
the money shark's end.

15:26.079 --> 15:28.606
With the hand of my best friend,

15:28.674 --> 15:31.038
we bring about
the money shark's end.

15:31.106 --> 15:33.305
With the hand
of my best friend...

15:33.373 --> 15:35.505
You sentimental fool!

15:35.573 --> 15:36.812
You don't know
what you're doing!

15:36.880 --> 15:38.573
You're gonna get us killed!

15:46.344 --> 15:47.822
<i>My building was destroyed,</i>

15:47.890 --> 15:49.408
<i>and he just gets away with it?</i>

15:49.476 --> 15:51.032
You tried to blow up my office

15:51.100 --> 15:52.261
at least twice this week.

15:52.329 --> 15:54.946
<i>Three times
if you count right now!</i>

15:55.332 --> 15:56.535
<i>Now!</i>

15:56.655 --> 15:57.791
<i>Now!</i>

15:57.868 --> 15:59.333
<i>Well, this is embarrassing.</i>

15:59.401 --> 16:02.616
Roxanne, you can't trust
the word of my sworn enemies

16:02.684 --> 16:05.603
whose only pastime is
constantly plotting against me.

16:05.671 --> 16:07.700
There is absolutely no truth

16:07.768 --> 16:09.644
to the claims
that my treasure hunting

16:09.712 --> 16:12.490
is in any way dangerous
to Duckburg.

16:12.558 --> 16:13.712
This just in,

16:13.780 --> 16:15.678
Scrooge McDuck's treasure
has transformed

16:15.746 --> 16:17.969
into a money shark and...
Hold on.

16:18.057 --> 16:19.927
I'm being told it now has legs.

16:19.995 --> 16:21.734
Of course it does.

16:22.890 --> 16:24.232
For those just tuning in,

16:24.300 --> 16:26.813
a money shark appears
to be heading to Duckburg,

16:26.924 --> 16:29.535
where it's sure
to cause untold destruction.

16:29.603 --> 16:31.266
Citizens are rushing
over in boats

16:31.334 --> 16:33.169
to collect
the falling gold debris.

16:33.280 --> 16:36.031
It seems Scrooge's fortune
is now up for grabs.

16:36.099 --> 16:37.612
Glomgold, your thoughts?

16:37.747 --> 16:38.790
<i>Huh!</i>

16:38.867 --> 16:40.320
Awk! Me money!

16:40.448 --> 16:44.211
And the safety of
the fine citizens of Duckburg.

16:59.103 --> 17:02.629
On the bright side, it's not
just trying to kill <i> us</i> anymore.

17:02.716 --> 17:04.218
Why did you break our chant?

17:04.311 --> 17:06.531
Is our friendship
not magical enough for you?

17:06.645 --> 17:08.008
Webby...

17:10.922 --> 17:12.372
When I see Launchpad,

17:12.449 --> 17:14.617
I'm docking him a day's wages.

17:21.181 --> 17:23.998
Look! It must be
after Scrooge's Number One Dime!

17:24.078 --> 17:25.330
Why would you think that?

17:25.398 --> 17:27.573
I dunno, a... a reason.

17:27.675 --> 17:29.687
No time to think. We gotta go!

17:33.908 --> 17:36.408
Heave off!
That's my money!

17:36.503 --> 17:38.375
Oy! Gilt gills!

17:38.443 --> 17:40.189
Come and get me.

17:51.755 --> 17:53.783
My Number One Dime!

17:57.260 --> 17:58.857
Ohh!

18:03.688 --> 18:06.640
Oh, no you don't,
you predatory piggy bank!

18:06.781 --> 18:08.467
Yaah!

18:11.532 --> 18:12.900
Yaah!

18:14.459 --> 18:16.581
- Hi, Uncle Scrooge!
- Hi, Mr. McDee!

18:16.695 --> 18:17.773
Everyone.

18:17.841 --> 18:19.304
Mr. McDuck!

18:30.394 --> 18:31.480
Hah!

18:32.286 --> 18:33.877
Hyah!

18:37.266 --> 18:38.368
The dime!

18:38.436 --> 18:40.596
Ha! Here! Here, girl!

18:41.518 --> 18:43.296
Oh! Whoa!

18:45.110 --> 18:46.732
Get me that dime,
and you'll finally have

18:46.800 --> 18:47.989
everything you've ever wanted!

18:48.056 --> 18:49.200
And how am I supposed to get it

18:49.268 --> 18:50.514
without being eaten alive?

18:50.582 --> 18:51.625
Ah, you'll figure it out.

18:51.693 --> 18:52.970
Lena! Look out!

18:55.978 --> 18:57.510
Webby! No!

19:00.927 --> 19:02.801
Aah! Aah!

19:04.312 --> 19:05.598
Huh?

19:06.146 --> 19:07.600
Lena!

19:08.085 --> 19:09.422
Why'd you save me?

19:09.492 --> 19:10.739
I thought you were mad at me.

19:10.807 --> 19:12.613
We're friends,
you beautiful idiot!

19:12.681 --> 19:14.639
I don't care what you did!

19:15.965 --> 19:17.407
Aah!

19:17.475 --> 19:18.659
Webby!

19:23.483 --> 19:26.269
With the hand
of my best friend...

19:26.963 --> 19:29.765
we bring about
the money shark's end!

19:36.051 --> 19:38.901
Looks like someone's
a hugger after all.

19:39.120 --> 19:41.768
- Don't tell anyone.
- Mmm!

19:42.579 --> 19:44.782
Dewey! Don't you ever get eaten

19:44.850 --> 19:47.563
by a magical Money Bin shark
again, you hear me, boy?

19:47.631 --> 19:49.577
Uh! Okay.

19:51.342 --> 19:52.970
Yah!

19:57.276 --> 19:59.302
No, no, not you again.

19:59.622 --> 20:02.153
<i>Roxanne Featherly

20:02.221 --> 20:04.181
<i>where Scrooge's
apparent generosity</i>

20:04.249 --> 20:07.237
<i>has provided a much-needed
economic boost to Duckburg.</i>

20:27.181 --> 20:29.553
<i>Thank you, kind sir!</i>

20:29.621 --> 20:32.361
<i>You're... welcome.</i>

20:43.601 --> 20:45.636
My Number One Dime!

20:45.704 --> 20:46.938
Mwah!

20:47.318 --> 20:48.655
Let's get out of here

20:48.723 --> 20:51.305
before these scavengers
throw me a parade.

20:51.396 --> 20:54.466
But how did all this happen
in the first place?

20:55.130 --> 20:57.464
You had the dime in your grasp!

20:57.532 --> 21:00.551
No, your crazy shark
had the dime in its throat,

21:00.619 --> 21:03.265
so excuse me if I didn't
want to be eaten!

21:03.333 --> 21:06.291
You would've probably survived!

21:06.359 --> 21:08.329
But you cared more
about your stupid "friends"

21:08.397 --> 21:10.179
than you did
about your own family!

21:10.247 --> 21:12.020
Your shark was out of control.

21:12.088 --> 21:14.406
The dime does neither
of us any good if I'm dead.

21:14.474 --> 21:15.643
I had no choice.

21:15.711 --> 21:18.319
You had a choice,
and you chose wrong!

21:18.387 --> 21:19.579
You're not supposed to think.

21:19.647 --> 21:21.199
You're supposed
to follow orders.

21:21.267 --> 21:23.415
Maybe I'm tired
of following orders.

21:23.483 --> 21:24.553
I'm done.

21:24.621 --> 21:26.687
- You can't get rid of me.
- Hmm!

21:27.243 --> 21:30.425
I'm the only one who can give
you what you truly want.

21:31.689 --> 21:34.580
Your dark heart's
