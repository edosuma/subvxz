00:00.870 --> 00:02.524
Previously on Z Nation.

00:04.091 --> 00:06.180
You were pretty banged up.
I did my best to sew you up.

00:09.052 --> 00:10.532
He was gonna take you away,
Roberta.

00:10.575 --> 00:13.839
No one else knows what I know
about you.

00:15.232 --> 00:16.842
Goodbye, Cooper.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.586
What if lithium is the secret
ingredient to the bizkits?

00:21.630 --> 00:23.066
We just found out that Estes

00:23.110 --> 00:25.286
is in charge of this whole
operation.

00:25.329 --> 00:26.548
The Talkers are in the wind

00:26.591 --> 00:27.853
George and Warren
infiltrate Altura

00:27.897 --> 00:29.551
the day before the election.

00:29.594 --> 00:31.074
Where are the Talkers hiding?

00:32.989 --> 00:34.773
It seems they've set
a staging area

00:34.817 --> 00:35.948
for the Talkers
near Pacifica.

00:35.992 --> 00:37.559
I'm gonna send
every available Alturan

00:37.602 --> 00:39.822
to wipe their kind
off this godforsaken earth.

00:40.127 --> 00:41.128
I did it.

00:41.171 --> 00:42.520
The vaccine works.

00:42.564 --> 00:45.871
But what you need for the cure
is right up here.

00:45.915 --> 00:47.308
The only way to be sure

00:47.351 --> 00:50.224
is to take my brain
and preserve it before I die.

00:57.187 --> 00:58.623
You are spiteful!

00:58.667 --> 01:00.495
No one stands against Altura!

01:00.538 --> 01:02.975
Find them and kill them all!

01:26.521 --> 01:29.393
I wish we could've given Sun Mei
a proper burial.

01:29.437 --> 01:31.352
She died for a reason.

01:31.395 --> 01:33.354
That's more than most people
can say.

01:33.397 --> 01:34.268
Yeah.

01:35.747 --> 01:37.880
Stash her brain someplace
where Estes can't find it.

01:37.923 --> 01:41.492
If anything happens to us,
you get her to Murphy.

01:47.411 --> 01:49.761
A reminder for all citizens.

01:49.805 --> 01:51.415
Don't forget to vote.

01:51.459 --> 01:54.070
Remember you'll need
two forms of I.D...

01:54.114 --> 01:57.682
Don't let that get to you.
It ain't over.

01:57.726 --> 01:58.727
I know.

01:59.641 --> 02:01.208
I was just thinking,

02:02.209 --> 02:03.166
remembering.

02:03.732 --> 02:05.386
We put that poster up,

02:05.995 --> 02:07.692
me and Dante.

02:07.953 --> 02:10.565
The artist who designed it.
Talkers who helped.

02:11.348 --> 02:12.741
They're all dead.

02:14.221 --> 02:15.961
And now Sun Mei.

02:18.442 --> 02:19.791
What if we win?

02:19.835 --> 02:21.619
What if we kill all the zombies?

02:21.663 --> 02:23.143
And there's no one left to know
but Talkers?

02:23.186 --> 02:24.318
We're not there yet.

02:25.928 --> 02:28.757
There's still a lot of people
with the will to survive.

02:30.585 --> 02:32.456
Including you.

02:34.545 --> 02:36.417
But at what cost?

02:37.287 --> 02:39.376
Keep your head in it.

02:39.420 --> 02:40.551
Let's go.

02:49.604 --> 02:52.259
Careful. Those blood samples are
from all over the apocalypse.

02:52.302 --> 02:55.958
God only knows what's in there.
Take them straight to my office.

03:01.093 --> 03:02.312
Colonel Keeler.

03:05.228 --> 03:07.187
Let's take a look at those maps.

03:08.275 --> 03:10.886
Are the militia
still assembling?

03:11.278 --> 03:12.888
As we speak, sir.

03:12.931 --> 03:16.892
Every able bodied volunteer is
being armed and sworn in as well

03:18.633 --> 03:19.851
Pandora?

03:20.243 --> 03:21.853
Yes, my love?

03:21.897 --> 03:23.942
Could you please come here and
show us what George told you?

03:23.986 --> 03:25.292
Of course.

03:29.034 --> 03:31.036
Well it took a little
convincing.

03:31.080 --> 03:32.777
But once I found her weakness,

03:32.821 --> 03:36.390
she gave it up
like the human that she is.

03:40.568 --> 03:42.613
There. Where these two roads
intersect.

03:42.657 --> 03:45.268
You'll find a clearing
in the trees.

03:45.312 --> 03:47.444
How many Talkers
did she say are there?

03:47.488 --> 03:49.054
All of them.

03:49.098 --> 03:51.622
Well then, that's perfect.

03:51.666 --> 03:53.233
Far from prying eyes.

03:53.276 --> 03:54.451
We'll need to hit them

03:54.495 --> 03:55.974
before George has a chance
to warn them.

03:56.018 --> 03:58.107
And before they can hit us.

03:58.150 --> 04:00.283
Your rules of engagement
haven't changed.

04:00.892 --> 04:02.372
I understand, sir.

04:15.951 --> 04:17.866
Why so tense?

04:20.129 --> 04:23.654
Forget about
the sick crazy circus.

04:24.612 --> 04:26.440
It's just you and me, baby.

No, no.

05:12.529 --> 05:14.096
Hopefully that's a good thing.

05:14.139 --> 05:14.966
Yeah.

05:15.010 --> 05:15.837
Come on.

05:27.849 --> 05:29.329
Something wrong?

05:29.807 --> 05:32.070
Let me take a look at your eye.

05:32.506 --> 05:33.376
I'm okay.

05:33.420 --> 05:35.030
You don't look okay.

05:37.641 --> 05:41.253
Listen, you got to
clear your mind of hate.

05:41.297 --> 05:42.907
There's no room for mistakes.

05:43.343 --> 05:46.737
It's about justice,
not vengeance.

05:48.086 --> 05:50.437
What happened back there
with Pandora?

05:51.002 --> 05:53.527
Exactly what was supposed to
happen.

05:53.570 --> 05:56.965
Well you look like you held out
for a long time.

05:57.618 --> 05:59.837
I could've gone the distance.

05:59.881 --> 06:01.535
I'm sure you could've.

06:03.450 --> 06:04.755
Let's find Kaya and CZ.

06:04.799 --> 06:07.758
They got a lot
of work to do before we're done.

06:10.587 --> 06:12.720

06:21.511 --> 06:22.643
we're out of here.

Where is Kaya?

07:44.333 --> 07:45.029
She's safe.

07:45.073 --> 07:47.205
She's with Nana and JZ.

07:47.249 --> 07:48.163
What now?

07:50.557 --> 07:52.341
We stick to the plan.

08:09.097 --> 08:12.753
This has got to be Warren's
most half baked plan yet.

08:13.101 --> 08:14.842

No.

You know what you're doing?

08:20.630 --> 08:21.501
Pretty much.

Oww.

Sorry.

No worries. Get going.

we can keep them hidden.

Not a lot. Flakes. Hopefully
we're not waiting much longer.

Everybody get ready.
Here they come.

08:59.321 --> 09:00.975
It's just a rando.

09:01.671 --> 09:02.542
Looks old school.

09:03.630 --> 09:05.283
Alright, I'll take care of this.

09:09.418 --> 09:12.116
You guys, just cool your jets,
will ya?

09:36.706 --> 09:37.620
Addy, wait!

Come and get it.
You guys hungry?

09:45.889 --> 09:46.542
Eat up.

09:48.631 --> 09:50.720
Well, that ought to hold them
for a while.

10:00.251 --> 10:01.949
It's a pretty low turnout.

10:01.992 --> 10:05.213
Lots of people are afraid
to travel, or dead.

10:05.256 --> 10:06.606
By the looks of this,

10:06.649 --> 10:08.390
a 'yes' vote for 'safety first'

10:08.433 --> 10:10.044
is really a vote
for Martial Law.

10:10.087 --> 10:12.176
People have given up
on Newmerica.

10:12.481 --> 10:16.093
They don't care who's in charge
as long as they feel safe.

Without the Talker vote,
Estes will win in a landslide.

remains.

everybody, look alive.

10:56.612 --> 10:58.745
Just remember,
you're not just dead.

10:58.788 --> 11:00.050
You're dead citizens.

11:00.094 --> 11:01.182

I don't like
all of this waiting.

11:02.923 --> 11:04.359
We're like sitting ducks
out here.

11:04.402 --> 11:06.709
Okay, don't go being yourself.
Just stick to the plan.

11:06.753 --> 11:10.539
Sweetie, we did not last this
long by sticking to the plan.

maybe all of them.

11:43.137 --> 11:45.400
Excellent. And they haven't
spotted you yet?

11:45.443 --> 11:48.577
No, sir. They're right where
your source said they'd be.

Who's a good little torturer?

11:50.318 --> 11:51.232
You are.

11:52.799 --> 11:54.278
As soon as your forces are
in place, execute your orders.

11:54.322 --> 11:56.933
Let's show them the meaning
of mercy and end this now.

11:56.977 --> 11:58.326
Yes, sir.

12:10.381 --> 12:11.252
On my orders.

12:17.649 --> 12:18.607
They spotted us.

12:18.650 --> 12:20.087
No prisoners! Charge!

12:32.839 --> 12:36.320
Here they come!
Fire! Fire! Fire!

12:36.756 --> 12:39.062

Mercy One. Come in, Mercy One.

14:03.712 --> 14:06.236

Talker-free future has begun.

14:06.280 --> 14:08.456
Not yet, sir.
There's been a setback.

14:08.499 --> 14:09.500
Setback?

14:09.544 --> 14:11.938
Yes, sir. There's nobody here.

14:11.981 --> 14:13.896
The camp was a decoy.
They set us up.

14:13.940 --> 14:18.422
That's impossible. I made sure
George was telling the truth.

14:18.466 --> 14:20.033
The Talkers aren't there?

14:20.381 --> 14:21.556
Nobody here.

14:21.599 --> 14:24.298
Just an old man with a bullhorn.

14:25.125 --> 14:26.430
A bull...

14:26.691 --> 14:29.999
Find out if he knows
where the Talkers are.

14:30.434 --> 14:33.698
Yes, sir. If he knows
where they are, he'll tell me.

14:33.742 --> 14:35.700
Right before I mercy him.

14:36.527 --> 14:38.703
Apparently George lied to you.

14:39.052 --> 14:42.142
Well I guess you can't trust
anybody these days.

14:47.582 --> 14:49.236
Where are the Talkers?

14:50.498 --> 14:53.631
You might want to save
your bullets.

14:59.724 --> 15:01.770
Eight thousand nine hundred
and ninety nine.

15:01.813 --> 15:03.554
In case that happens.

15:14.435 --> 15:15.566
What are you looking at?

15:16.567 --> 15:17.307
Get away from me.

15:17.917 --> 15:18.961
That's my cue.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.792
]

15:28.928 --> 15:29.972

15:30.538 --> 15:32.235
Can you hear me

15:34.498 --> 15:35.586
Colonel?

15:35.630 --> 15:37.849
Operation Mercy.
Can you hear me?

15:44.856 --> 15:46.902

15:57.043 --> 15:58.653
Gate three to Estes. Over.

15:58.696 --> 16:00.568
This is Estes.
Go ahead, gate three.

16:00.611 --> 16:04.572
You better get down here, sir.
I think you need to see this.

16:08.532 --> 16:09.969
Umm, state your business.

16:10.012 --> 16:11.057
Yeah.

16:11.100 --> 16:12.319
We're here to vote.

16:15.931 --> 16:18.107
You'll need two forms of I.D.

16:18.673 --> 16:20.066
And a pulse.

16:21.458 --> 16:24.244
I'm not seeing
many likely voters here.

16:24.287 --> 16:26.507
I'm not even sure you'd qualify.

16:32.469 --> 16:34.428
What's the matter, Estes?

16:34.471 --> 16:37.648
Hard to mass mercy
when they can still talk?

16:37.692 --> 16:39.172
The militia will be back soon.

16:39.215 --> 16:40.434
We both know that's not true!

16:45.265 --> 16:47.267
Your militia aren't coming back.

16:48.746 --> 16:50.574
At least not as humans.

16:50.618 --> 16:52.098
This cycle of death can end now.

16:52.141 --> 16:53.882
You say that
like it's a good thing.

16:53.925 --> 16:55.405
It's over, Estes.

16:55.666 --> 16:57.842
The people have already
opened the other gates

16:57.886 --> 16:59.235
and let the Talkers in.

16:59.279 --> 17:02.369
All they want to do
is be with their loved ones.

17:02.804 --> 17:05.067
You have no idea
what you're doing.

17:05.937 --> 17:07.026
Shut up.

17:07.069 --> 17:07.548
Gun!

17:09.898 --> 17:10.594
Open the gate!

17:11.378 --> 17:12.379
Estes!

17:13.554 --> 17:14.598
Don't let what's-her-face
get away!

17:14.903 --> 17:16.035
He's turning feral.

17:16.078 --> 17:16.948
I have lithium!

17:17.601 --> 17:19.125
Come on. Move it. Move it.

17:19.864 --> 17:21.214
Come on, get them all in here!

17:21.257 --> 17:22.824
The election polls close
in fifteen minutes!

17:22.867 --> 17:25.087
George, you and I go after
Pandora and Estes!

17:25.131 --> 17:26.741
You two, hold it down!

17:26.784 --> 17:28.612
Save some beat-down for us!

17:42.670 --> 17:43.453
On Estes.

17:43.845 --> 17:44.802
I'll take Pandora.

18:04.605 --> 18:05.345
Bitch.

18:54.568 --> 18:56.309
Hello, Roberta.

19:06.014 --> 19:07.581
I know. I know.

19:07.624 --> 19:09.757
It's a bit of a surprise.

19:16.677 --> 19:18.331
I can't...I can't do this
right now.

19:18.374 --> 19:19.332
No. Listen.

19:20.594 --> 19:22.117
I came a long way to see you.
Hear me out.

19:22.161 --> 19:22.726
Hey!

19:23.553 --> 19:25.164
Is this guy bothering you?

19:29.342 --> 19:30.995
Oh. You!

19:33.433 --> 19:35.086
I'm glad you're alive.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.567
I gotta go.

19:44.357 --> 19:46.228
Hey man,
I don't want any trouble.

19:46.272 --> 19:49.492
You know, she may be glad
you're alive. Me,

19:50.580 --> 19:51.886
not so much.

20:02.592 --> 20:04.159
Warren, over here.

20:10.687 --> 20:12.472
Estes is inside.

20:12.733 --> 20:13.995
Pandora?

20:16.345 --> 20:17.912
All right, on three.

20:17.955 --> 20:18.826
One,

20:18.869 --> 20:19.783
two,

20:19.827 --> 20:20.523
three.

20:33.493 --> 20:36.800
Hello, George.
Lieutenant Warren.

20:36.844 --> 20:39.803
Welcome to the beating heart
of Altura.

20:42.023 --> 20:42.850
Come on up.

20:46.941 --> 20:50.161
Let me show you
what all the fuss is about.

20:50.205 --> 20:53.687
Energy. Security.
To build our new world upon.

21:02.304 --> 21:03.653
All the fuss,

21:04.263 --> 21:05.438
for a battery.

21:07.788 --> 21:09.224
I'm sorry, George.

21:09.877 --> 21:13.184
I know all of this
has been very hard on you.

21:13.228 --> 21:16.231
Learning you can be wrong
is part of growing up.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.059
We'll see who's teaching who
a lesson.

21:18.102 --> 21:19.930
It's over, Estes.

21:19.974 --> 21:22.106
We're gonna let everybody know
what you did.

21:22.150 --> 21:25.719
Taking lithium from the Talkers
so you can have a battery.

21:25.762 --> 21:27.329
Not so I can have a battery.

21:27.373 --> 21:28.765
So what's left of human kind

21:28.809 --> 21:30.898
can have a means
to power the future.

21:30.941 --> 21:34.510
Reliable storage
twenty four hours a day.

21:34.815 --> 21:37.121
So at night
when the solar power is gone,

21:37.165 --> 21:38.384
we have lights

21:39.820 --> 21:41.691
and communications and
an electric fence around us.

21:41.735 --> 21:44.085
While others of us
are left to starve and turn.

21:44.128 --> 21:45.826
These are desperate times.

21:46.522 --> 21:49.308
Choices have to be made.
Hard choices.

21:49.786 --> 21:51.048
The kind of decisions

21:51.092 --> 21:53.529
you can't just leave up to
a traumatized mob.

21:53.573 --> 21:57.533
Radical change always involves
collateral damage.

21:57.577 --> 21:59.187
Darwin doesn't have a heart.

21:59.230 --> 22:00.536
Neither do you.

22:00.580 --> 22:02.277
It's not about me.

22:02.886 --> 22:05.324
It's about the future
of humanity.

22:05.976 --> 22:06.803
Yes,

22:07.413 --> 22:09.153
I staged the attacks.

22:09.763 --> 22:11.242
A necessary evil

22:11.286 --> 22:13.549
to push a reluctant population
into action.

22:13.593 --> 22:16.160
Starving the Talkers
was a necessary evil?

22:16.204 --> 22:17.336
Do the math.

22:18.946 --> 22:20.426
Our known reserve of lithium
would be used up by the Talkers

22:20.469 --> 22:21.862
at the current rate of
consumption

22:21.905 --> 22:24.560
in less than three years.
And then what?

22:24.604 --> 22:26.432
Sun Mei found an alternative.

22:26.475 --> 22:27.346
It's too late.

22:28.564 --> 22:29.130
By the time a working vaccine
was ready,

22:30.044 --> 22:31.045
we'd have used up the lithium.

22:32.568 --> 22:34.483
We'd be left with a large
population of feral Talkers

22:34.527 --> 22:35.789
and no electricity.

22:35.832 --> 22:38.661
You paid for batteries
with human souls.

22:38.705 --> 22:39.923
Souls?

22:43.884 --> 22:47.061
Talkers are a small price
to pay for security.

22:47.801 --> 22:50.194
They're freaks. A mistake.

22:50.238 --> 22:52.240
Is that what you tell Pandora?

22:52.588 --> 22:53.502
How romantic.

22:53.763 --> 22:55.591
She's a useful tool.

22:55.896 --> 22:59.682
But in the end, she's a mumbling
corpse like the rest of them.

22:59.726 --> 23:01.423
We're gonna let everybody know

23:01.467 --> 23:03.338
how you were behind
all the attacks.

23:03.904 --> 23:05.427
No one would believe you.

23:07.298 --> 23:10.650
No? But they'll believe you.

23:10.954 --> 23:12.695
Did you get all that, CZ?

23:12.956 --> 23:14.044
Yes, ma'am.

23:14.088 --> 23:15.611
Every word has been broadcast
live.

23:17.570 --> 23:19.093
I don't believe you.

23:19.136 --> 23:22.792
Crank up the volume, CZ.
The man doesn't believe us.

23:24.751 --> 23:25.969
This is insane.

23:26.013 --> 23:27.493
Insane.

23:27.797 --> 23:29.843
You're right. This is insane.

23:29.886 --> 23:31.932
But why don't you go back
and tell us

23:31.975 --> 23:34.108
how the Talkers are freaks
and a mistake?

23:35.370 --> 23:37.459
A mumbling corpse?
That's how you see me?

23:40.070 --> 23:42.116
That isn't how I meant it, baby.

23:42.725 --> 23:45.424
Well then how exactly
did you mean it,

23:45.946 --> 23:46.773
baby?

23:46.816 --> 23:48.557
This shit about to get real.

23:50.516 --> 23:51.821
This is ridiculous.

23:51.865 --> 23:53.257
This is ridiculous.

23:55.434 --> 23:58.393
This proves nothing.
What I did, I did for humanity.

23:58.437 --> 24:00.439
What if there's a new definition
of humanity?

24:00.743 --> 24:02.528
There's only one direction
that goes.

24:02.571 --> 24:05.661
The dead will be all that's
left. What happens then?

24:05.705 --> 24:06.749
When we've traded our future

24:07.924 --> 24:09.143
to buy a few more years
for the Talkers?

24:09.186 --> 24:11.362
When there's no more living
to feed upon?

24:11.406 --> 24:13.321
How long before the last vestige
of humanity

24:13.364 --> 24:15.976
rots away and turns to dust?

24:16.019 --> 24:16.890
Amen.

24:16.933 --> 24:18.239
We can't get rid of the Talkers

24:18.282 --> 24:19.893
just because
they're inconvenient.

24:19.936 --> 24:21.764
Or mercy them
just because they're dead.

24:21.808 --> 24:24.898
The Talkers are rotting bags
of putrified meat.

24:25.289 --> 24:27.422
And we must cleanse them
from society

24:27.466 --> 24:29.337
before they drag us all down
to their level.

24:29.380 --> 24:30.686
Is that what you think
I've been doing?

24:30.730 --> 24:32.079
Dragging you down to my level?

24:32.122 --> 24:33.863
We talked about this.
You're different.

24:36.126 --> 24:36.823
Am I?

24:41.392 --> 24:45.266
Or am I just a rotting bag
of putrified flesh?

24:45.701 --> 24:47.224
What is it, baby?

24:51.490 --> 24:53.361
You know
maybe if you were a Talker,

24:53.404 --> 24:55.276
you'd feel differently
about this whole dead thing.

25:03.937 --> 25:04.851
Buzz off!

25:13.816 --> 25:15.818
Pandora, please.

25:15.862 --> 25:17.864
Stop whining.

25:18.647 --> 25:21.128
I hate it when you whine.

25:21.171 --> 25:23.652
It's just so whiney.

25:29.440 --> 25:32.487
You know, I had big plans
for us, Roman.

25:33.793 --> 25:35.359
It's a pity.

25:42.671 --> 25:44.499
What have you done?

25:44.717 --> 25:46.457
If the lithium overheats,

25:46.719 --> 25:49.025
it'll kill everyone in Altura!

25:49.504 --> 25:51.332
George was right
about one thing.

25:51.375 --> 25:53.552
Humans and Talkers are equal.

25:54.509 --> 25:57.860
I guess we all deserve
final mercy in the end.

25:59.166 --> 26:01.081
I have to restart the pumps.

26:01.124 --> 26:04.606
We only have a few more minutes
before the coolant boils off!

26:05.346 --> 26:06.086
Go.

26:13.789 --> 26:16.444
So you think you can mercy me,
George?

26:16.487 --> 26:17.663
Did you change your outfit?

26:19.186 --> 26:21.405
Well I always want to look
my best before a big fight.

26:21.971 --> 26:22.885
You like?

26:24.017 --> 26:24.931
No.

26:49.085 --> 26:50.913
I don't want to have to
mercy you.

26:52.611 --> 26:53.699
Really?

26:55.091 --> 26:57.746
Not even after I chopped up
poor helpless Dante?

26:59.705 --> 27:02.142
Your life isn't enough
to pay for Dante,

27:02.185 --> 27:03.970
let alone the others
you've killed.

27:04.013 --> 27:06.233
Oh, boo hoo.

27:09.105 --> 27:09.976
What are you doing?!

27:10.019 --> 27:11.847
Stopping a catastrophe!

27:11.891 --> 27:13.806
I can't get control
of the power flow.

27:13.849 --> 27:15.198
The lithium could catch fire
and explode

27:15.242 --> 27:17.026
if we don't get these pumps
working!

27:20.203 --> 27:21.509
Help me!

27:41.703 --> 27:43.618
The coolant is starting to boil!

27:43.966 --> 27:46.708
We have to get this valve open
and restore circulation!

27:46.752 --> 27:47.796
If the lithium is exposed
to oxygen,

27:47.840 --> 27:49.885
it'll start
an uncontrolled burn!

27:55.108 --> 27:56.022
Move!

28:27.009 --> 28:27.923
You're burned.

28:27.967 --> 28:28.924
I know.

28:30.056 --> 28:30.665
The main cooling pump
is burned out.

28:31.753 --> 28:33.668
We need to bypass it
using this hose.

28:33.712 --> 28:34.538
Hook it up over there.

28:34.582 --> 28:37.019
-Hurry!

28:39.369 --> 28:41.415
Damn apocalypse piece of shit.

28:50.032 --> 28:54.384
It's your humanity.
That's what makes you so weak.

29:00.129 --> 29:02.218
You should be happy.

29:04.003 --> 29:05.395
You'll get to see Dante
real soon.

29:25.938 --> 29:28.288
We should do this more often.

29:29.376 --> 29:30.899
You talk too much.

30:03.279 --> 30:04.454
What?

30:07.196 --> 30:09.633
Do I disgust you?

30:14.682 --> 30:17.206
Look at me! Look at me!

30:24.779 --> 30:25.606
No you don't.

30:25.998 --> 30:28.174
You don't get off that easy.

30:39.272 --> 30:40.926
I could've been you.

30:45.365 --> 30:46.409
No!

31:12.914 --> 31:14.655
I think it's working.

31:17.266 --> 31:19.442
What are you doing? It's over.

31:19.486 --> 31:22.097
You're ruining humanity's
last chance.

31:22.141 --> 31:24.012
I can't let that happen.

31:46.992 --> 31:48.428
Warren?

31:56.088 --> 31:58.351
There's no blood.

32:16.673 --> 32:18.458
Cooper?

32:22.418 --> 32:24.464
Was it all a dream?

32:25.508 --> 32:26.422
No.

32:35.475 --> 32:37.042
Where's everyone?

32:38.739 --> 32:40.175
They're voting.

32:43.265 --> 32:44.527
Estes?

32:45.093 --> 32:46.965
He's in custody.

32:53.536 --> 32:55.147
What about Murphy?

32:56.800 --> 32:59.194
Me and the red devil,
we're cool.

32:59.978 --> 33:03.590
Once he understood why I was
here, he brought me to you.

33:11.076 --> 33:13.121
How are you feeling?

33:13.165 --> 33:14.688
Empty.

33:19.127 --> 33:22.000
What was it
you wanted to tell me?

33:28.049 --> 33:29.355
Back at the farm,

33:30.617 --> 33:32.967
when I found you,

33:34.403 --> 33:38.494
I was operating on you,
and you bled out.

33:40.322 --> 33:42.455
There was nothing I could do.

33:45.023 --> 33:47.199
Roberta, you died.

33:53.074 --> 33:54.206
I'm dead?

33:59.515 --> 34:02.083
I was dead this whole time?

34:02.344 --> 34:04.607
But you came back

34:04.651 --> 34:07.306
as a Talker but different.

34:09.656 --> 34:12.572
Maybe it was the Black Rain
you got exposed to.

34:13.181 --> 34:14.791
I don't know.

34:16.271 --> 34:18.186
Damn apocalypse.

34:18.578 --> 34:20.884
I didn't want to tell you that.

34:23.104 --> 34:25.324
I thought it might change you.

34:27.500 --> 34:29.850
I didn't want you to change.

34:31.591 --> 34:34.550
You came all this way
to tell me this?

34:37.031 --> 34:39.120
I wanted you to know.

34:41.818 --> 34:43.603
You forgive me?

34:44.734 --> 34:46.780
Do I forgive you?

34:50.566 --> 34:53.787
Do you forgive me
for locking you in the trunk?

34:59.184 --> 35:01.577
Everything that I said to you

35:02.926 --> 35:04.319
still applies.

35:05.190 --> 35:07.192
It was from the heart.

35:13.241 --> 35:15.939
What we had together was real.

35:17.724 --> 35:19.595
It was good.

35:20.335 --> 35:24.818
And it was so worth
fighting for.

35:28.691 --> 35:32.956
I just don't know how much fight
I have left in me.

35:38.092 --> 35:40.790
I just found out I was dead.

35:44.185 --> 35:46.187
Well you don't look dead.

35:50.017 --> 35:51.149
Did you vote?

35:51.540 --> 35:52.976
Always.

35:53.629 --> 35:56.023
I'm not a joiner though.

35:56.545 --> 35:58.460
So,

35:58.504 --> 36:00.506
I said my piece.

36:02.421 --> 36:04.031
I'm gonna go.

36:06.251 --> 36:08.035
But I want you to know...

36:08.078 --> 36:13.258
If you ever want to dance
with this man,

36:13.301 --> 36:15.390
you want to hear
some good music...

36:17.131 --> 36:19.438
I know where to find you.

36:22.832 --> 36:24.617
Goodbye, Roberta.

36:42.417 --> 36:44.027
Goodbye, Cooper.

37:06.441 --> 37:07.660
Goodbye.

37:12.534 --> 37:14.841
May I have your attention!

37:14.884 --> 37:18.410
Ladies and gentlemen, living
and dead and those in between.

37:18.453 --> 37:20.629
The polls are now
officially closed.

37:20.673 --> 37:22.762
The votes are now being tallied.

37:24.024 --> 37:25.068
Hey.

37:29.464 --> 37:31.205
I'm glad that worked out.

37:31.249 --> 37:34.991
Oh, yeah. Chicks dig a man
with a hook.

37:35.601 --> 37:37.559
I'm not even gonna touch that.

37:38.430 --> 37:39.561
What's next for you, Doc?

37:39.605 --> 37:42.260
Maybe I'll mosey back to
the Water Keepers.

37:42.303 --> 37:44.958
See if Kuruk wants help
with that dam.

37:45.741 --> 37:46.481
You?

37:47.047 --> 37:48.788
Haven't thought about it.

37:48.831 --> 37:49.484
You know, probably just

37:50.703 --> 37:51.747
wander the earth doing
random good deeds.

37:51.791 --> 37:53.271
Yeah, right.

37:54.010 --> 37:56.317
No, right. Right on.

37:56.361 --> 37:58.450
And killing shit
with the Z Whacker.

37:58.493 --> 38:01.801
Now that,
that goes without saying.

38:04.282 --> 38:05.674
You nervous?

38:06.501 --> 38:08.764
I will feel better
when this is all over.

38:08.808 --> 38:11.289
So if they ratify
the constitution, then what?

38:11.811 --> 38:14.074
We elect people
to uphold the constitution.

38:14.117 --> 38:15.597
People like...

38:16.032 --> 38:16.990
you?

38:17.991 --> 38:19.122
Maybe.

38:19.862 --> 38:20.950
Yeah.

38:22.778 --> 38:24.780
But I'll need a lot of help.

38:24.824 --> 38:26.304
That's fair.

38:35.400 --> 38:36.792
What's that?

38:38.054 --> 38:40.666
Sun Mei said to give it to you.

38:41.797 --> 38:44.887
She said you would know
what to do with it.

38:48.848 --> 38:49.501
Everybody,

38:51.154 --> 38:52.634
what do you say we get George
up here to announce the results?

38:52.678 --> 38:54.288
Come on, George!

38:54.332 --> 38:56.203
George! George!
George!

38:56.246 --> 38:59.162
You have come so far.

38:59.206 --> 39:01.948
George! George!
George!

39:11.523 --> 39:13.394
George! George!
George!

39:24.927 --> 39:26.842
I was going to give this
speech...

39:32.152 --> 39:33.327
Sorry.

39:34.023 --> 39:35.547
Can everyone hear me?

39:35.590 --> 39:36.504
Yes!

39:37.026 --> 39:38.114
Good.

39:45.948 --> 39:48.255
I was going to give this speech,

39:50.083 --> 39:51.998
it feels like a lifetime ago,

39:52.607 --> 39:54.740
before the bombings.

39:54.783 --> 39:57.438
It was a different speech
back then.

39:58.134 --> 39:59.832
For a different world.

39:59.875 --> 40:01.921
And so much has changed.

40:02.965 --> 40:04.706
I know I have.

40:05.490 --> 40:09.407
But one thing
has always remained the same.

40:11.452 --> 40:13.454
My belief in democracy

40:14.368 --> 40:16.631
and the rule of law.

40:23.769 --> 40:26.467
I lost a lot of friends
getting here.

40:27.120 --> 40:28.426
We all did.

40:30.732 --> 40:33.909
But I gained some new friends
too.

40:35.824 --> 40:37.826
Friends who taught me
the meaning

40:37.870 --> 40:41.482
of the words loyalty
and courage.

40:42.614 --> 40:46.618
Who showed me what can be done
when we have each other's backs.

40:46.879 --> 40:50.578
What could be accomplished
when we believed in one another.

40:51.361 --> 40:55.496
And carry each other forward,
no matter the obstacle.

40:56.105 --> 40:57.585
There were so many times

40:57.629 --> 40:59.544
I thought this moment
would never come.

40:59.805 --> 41:01.937
And yet, here we are.

41:03.373 --> 41:04.462
So,

41:05.419 --> 41:07.247
without further delay,

41:07.987 --> 41:11.991
the moment we've all been
waiting so very long for!

41:12.339 --> 41:14.472
Let's get to the results.

41:34.492 --> 41:35.667
Sun Mei.

42:02.345 --> 42:04.652
That's it.

42:06.262 --> 42:09.265
Of course.
