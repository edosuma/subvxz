01:26.378 --> 01:29.548
As a child, I heard stories about Trantor,

01:31.049 --> 01:34.303
the city that was a planet
at the heart of the galaxy.

01:36.346 --> 01:40.642
I was told the people who lived there
were sinners who followed a false prophet…

01:42.811 --> 01:46.315
a man who believed himself
above the Sleeper's words.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.693
I didn't believe the stories

01:50.569 --> 01:51.695
until I met him.

02:01.997 --> 02:04.833
You have just completed the jump, Empire.

02:05.834 --> 02:09.128
We'll be reaching the Surah System
within a few hours.

02:24.853 --> 02:29.525
I was told that the Emperor
could create or destroy worlds,

02:29.608 --> 02:34.613
that he had triumphed over death itself
and would live forever.

02:35.781 --> 02:37.533
And when I looked into his eyes…

02:38.742 --> 02:43.747
I saw a man who, in all his lifetimes,
had never known doubt…

02:46.667 --> 02:49.753
until he encountered Hari Seldon.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.486
I'm ready to review for--

03:16.822 --> 03:20.158
A moment, Empire.
I wasn't expecting you so soon.

03:24.997 --> 03:27.666
Even as a child,
you'd watch my preparations.

03:38.468 --> 03:40.637
Are you feeling quite well, Empire?

03:41.346 --> 03:42.723
It's just the jump.

03:44.266 --> 03:48.478
I know the Spacers are engineered for it,
but I barely consider them human.

03:50.272 --> 03:53.066
It can be disconcerting, I know.

03:54.276 --> 03:55.319
What's it like…

03:56.528 --> 03:58.197
to be awake for it?

03:58.280 --> 03:59.781
When space folds?

04:01.867 --> 04:05.162
The human mind can't tolerate
the discontinuity.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.246
But…

04:08.248 --> 04:09.499
yours can.

04:09.583 --> 04:13.212
If I could explain it,
you wouldn't have to sleep through it.

04:20.427 --> 04:22.221
Leviathan crystal.

04:22.304 --> 04:26.058
Salt from the leviathan mines
on the Maiden.

04:26.141 --> 04:27.851
And its significance?

04:27.935 --> 04:30.562
It symbolizes the journey
of the three goddesses,

04:30.646 --> 04:32.648
Maiden, Mother and Crone.

04:32.731 --> 04:36.527
Adherents pray
by ritualistically touching it.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.948
Goes to the central theme of Luminism,

04:41.031 --> 04:44.868
cycles, ouroboros,
nature seeking completion.

04:45.994 --> 04:47.079
Origination?

04:47.162 --> 04:50.541
Luminists believe the goddesses
were once a single entity,

04:50.624 --> 04:53.877
but when Surah collided
with the planet of…

04:56.964 --> 04:58.298
Begins with a D.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.592
Dol.

05:01.260 --> 05:04.596
It split the goddesses apart,
creating the three moons.

05:05.180 --> 05:07.140
The only habitable moon is the Maiden.

05:08.350 --> 05:09.643
Age of faith?

05:09.726 --> 05:11.854
15,000 years.

05:14.064 --> 05:15.983
Predates the Empire itself.

05:17.359 --> 05:18.944
Number of believers?

05:19.570 --> 05:20.904
Three trillion.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.081
I've never asked you,

05:32.374 --> 05:34.877
how is it that you believe?

05:36.503 --> 05:39.047
How? Or why?

05:39.131 --> 05:40.215
The latter.

05:42.509 --> 05:47.014
From the moment you come into the world,
you and your brothers know your purpose.

05:47.097 --> 05:49.641
But the rest of us have to seek
these things on our own.

05:49.725 --> 05:52.811
But… you know your purpose.

05:54.229 --> 05:57.274
It's to serve my brothers, to serve me,
to serve the Empire above all.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.109
It's literally written into your code.

05:59.193 --> 06:01.904
And I am quite fulfilled in that service.

06:02.946 --> 06:06.325
But the search for meaning
is not always about the answer.

06:06.408 --> 06:08.994
It's also the process of seeking
that enlightens.

06:10.329 --> 06:13.290
The goddesses didn't choose
to be split into three.

06:13.916 --> 06:15.751
They long to be made one again.

06:16.627 --> 06:19.880
The salty terrain of the Maiden
is said to be their tears.

06:19.963 --> 06:23.842
But it was their sacrifice that graced
the rest of us with wholeness.

06:23.926 --> 06:28.096
At every point in our lives,
we have the power to choose our own path.

06:28.180 --> 06:33.143
The goddesses guide us at every step
toward service and truth,

06:33.936 --> 06:36.438
as though toward the center
of a great spiral.

06:40.484 --> 06:44.780
And this Zephyr Halima who challenges us,
what has her path been?

06:45.322 --> 06:48.951
She hails from Mirrus Twelve,
born into the faith.

06:49.034 --> 06:52.162
After the earthquakes there,
she became a sort of a savior,

06:52.246 --> 06:54.039
spearheading the recovery effort.

06:54.122 --> 06:56.708
But she's been elevated to Zephyr
for less than a year.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.587
She's only just pulled herself
out from the rubble.

07:01.547 --> 07:03.966
Forgive me, Empire, but we have
entered the Maiden's atmosphere

07:04.049 --> 07:06.343
and will be approaching
the Salt Palace in moments.

07:31.577 --> 07:33.620
Ready to meet the clamoring masses?

07:34.663 --> 07:37.082
I was planning on staying aboard the ship.

07:37.165 --> 07:38.333
Why?

07:38.417 --> 07:41.378
Clearly, many on the Maiden know
I embrace their faith.

07:41.879 --> 07:44.089
This could be used to your disadvantage.

07:44.173 --> 07:45.674
Don't be ridiculous.

07:47.134 --> 07:51.471
You're my only real insight
into the Luminist beliefs.

07:55.809 --> 07:56.810
You're going.

08:25.047 --> 08:26.590
Zephyr Halima.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.968
Welcome to the Maiden, Empire.

08:31.720 --> 08:35.640
I know preparing for a formal ceremony
can be daunting,

08:36.140 --> 08:38.101
which is why I petitioned
the Ring of Zephyrs

08:38.184 --> 08:40.854
and was granted the honor
of welcoming you alone.

08:41.563 --> 08:42.648
Alone?

08:42.731 --> 08:47.027
Empire is undoubtedly accustomed
to a certain degree of pageantry,

08:47.611 --> 08:51.114
but given the somber circumstances
of the Proxima's passing,

08:51.907 --> 08:54.368
a more florid reception felt somehow…

08:55.452 --> 08:56.787
indecorous.

08:56.870 --> 08:57.913
Of course.

08:58.997 --> 09:03.043
I want to thank you, from my heart,
for making the journey to us.

09:03.126 --> 09:07.673
Your presence speaks to how important
Luminism must be to the Empire.

09:08.257 --> 09:12.594
As a gesture of my gratitude,
I'd like to offer you a drink.

09:22.187 --> 09:25.148
The water is from the Womb
of the Mother itself.

09:25.732 --> 09:28.861
The salt from this cup is said to draw out
any impure intentions

09:28.944 --> 09:30.863
from the minds of those who drink from it.

09:30.946 --> 09:34.616
Sadly, Empire is not able to accept
any untested potables.

09:34.700 --> 09:39.913
I'm afraid whatever impurities
I may harbor will have to remain hidden.

09:39.997 --> 09:42.833
Something tells me
that's how you'd prefer it.

09:45.169 --> 09:48.672
In any case, I look forward
to getting to know each other better.

09:50.048 --> 09:51.717
Triple blessings to you all.

10:01.685 --> 10:04.021
What is the word I'm looking for?

10:04.605 --> 10:05.606
Worthy?

10:06.398 --> 10:07.524
That will do.

10:09.067 --> 10:11.570
I don't think
she was trying to poison you.

10:11.653 --> 10:13.488
No, not literally.

10:13.572 --> 10:15.782
But I don't think anyone
with pure intentions

10:15.866 --> 10:18.744
would wheedle their way
on to my welcoming committee.

10:37.721 --> 10:38.931
Stay sharp.

10:39.515 --> 10:41.225
Our target may be armed.

10:42.559 --> 10:44.144
Or he might be dead.

10:45.229 --> 10:46.230
He's alive.

10:46.730 --> 10:49.566
Empire ships are as good
at preserving their people's lives…

10:50.108 --> 10:51.652
as they are at taking others'.

11:02.204 --> 11:04.998
Commander,
you're alive because you're useful to us.

11:06.208 --> 11:07.751
And you're already dead.

11:10.379 --> 11:11.797
You just don't know it yet.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.090
Course we know it.

11:15.592 --> 11:17.427
We're an army of ghosts.

11:41.952 --> 11:44.162
Hey. This way.

12:08.312 --> 12:09.354
You okay?

12:11.982 --> 12:13.358
Gia.

12:16.778 --> 12:17.905
What happened here?

12:21.074 --> 12:22.409
Oh, geez.

12:22.492 --> 12:24.870
It's okay. You're fine.

12:25.954 --> 12:28.707
Make for a nice story one day,
if we survive this.

12:33.045 --> 12:35.547
Now, let's get out of here
before we get shot.

12:53.774 --> 12:55.317
We have the manifest.

12:56.026 --> 12:57.694
Sort the names.

12:57.778 --> 13:02.783
I need environmental, propulsion,
and astronautics engineers.

13:03.367 --> 13:05.118
And contact Team Alder.

13:05.953 --> 13:07.871
I want the corvettes ready for launch.

13:08.413 --> 13:10.290
They're still at the caldera.

13:10.374 --> 13:12.751
Tell them to work faster.

13:13.585 --> 13:15.420
The Invictus won't wait forever.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.131
Why is she still alive?

13:20.884 --> 13:22.928
That vault.

13:23.345 --> 13:24.847
It's the worst kind of unknown.

13:25.722 --> 13:27.724
And she seems to be the key to it.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.228
Once we've neutralized it,

13:31.311 --> 13:32.938
we'll kill her.

13:33.856 --> 13:35.858
Are you sure this will work, Huntress?

13:36.316 --> 13:38.527
The Invictus is our redemption,

13:39.236 --> 13:42.364
and we have earned it with our pain.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.381
You ready?

14:10.726 --> 14:12.519
Are these the names of your original crew?

14:13.103 --> 14:15.731
Every person who served
on the Deliverance.

14:16.481 --> 14:20.903
You can see we lost some people to age
or accidents when we settled Terminus.

14:21.403 --> 14:23.280
Show me the environmental engineer.

14:37.461 --> 14:38.921
Astronautics?

14:40.672 --> 14:41.798
Who was his second?

14:43.050 --> 14:45.761
I was. I took over that specialty.

14:47.346 --> 14:48.680
Propulsion?

14:50.641 --> 14:53.685
Studied at Crito Orbital Academy.

14:54.770 --> 15:00.943
Logged over 5,000 hours on
imperial transport and merchant vessels,

15:01.026 --> 15:02.528
sub-light and FTL.

15:05.614 --> 15:07.574
You're trying to crew a jumpship.

15:07.658 --> 15:09.868
So why did you shoot down
Commander Dorwin's?

15:10.452 --> 15:14.373
Because I needed the man himself,
not his little crater jumper.

15:14.456 --> 15:16.834
What you've done is an act of war.

15:17.417 --> 15:18.669
We have who we need.

15:18.752 --> 15:21.630
Restore power to the fence and recode it.

15:21.713 --> 15:24.216
I don't want these people sneaking away
before we're done.

15:30.681 --> 15:32.766
-Hi.
-Hiya.

15:45.529 --> 15:47.447
I will explain this only once.

15:48.240 --> 15:51.076
The Foundation has
a breadth of knowledge we lack.

15:51.660 --> 15:54.288
And so we require a handful of your people

15:55.080 --> 15:57.749
to assist us in repairing a starship.

15:57.833 --> 16:00.002
If the repairs go as planned,

16:00.085 --> 16:04.047
we leave Terminus, and you return
to life as you've known it.

16:04.131 --> 16:06.884
If you refuse us, then we all die,

16:07.676 --> 16:09.553
Anacreons, Terminus alike.

16:09.636 --> 16:12.097
Jacenta Rov, step forward.

16:16.935 --> 16:19.688
You were the chief environmental engineer
on the Deliverance?

16:19.771 --> 16:22.024
I was. But I won't work for you.

16:22.524 --> 16:24.610
My loyalty lies with the Foundation.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.621
I shot one leg.

16:35.704 --> 16:37.331
Your husband has another.

16:37.998 --> 16:39.708
Do we understand each other?

16:46.048 --> 16:47.216
Akiva Lee.

16:50.802 --> 16:54.056
Can you maintain a quantum folding engine
on an Altair-class warship?

16:55.474 --> 16:56.475
Yes.

17:03.106 --> 17:04.483
Lewis Pirenne.

17:04.566 --> 17:07.152
Please, it's been 30 years since I've--

17:14.535 --> 17:17.162
You're certain this is everyone we need?

17:23.836 --> 17:25.963
I thought you were trying to poison me.

17:27.589 --> 17:30.008
They helped, the wolvesbreath leaves.

17:30.926 --> 17:32.594
I'm less sore today.

17:32.678 --> 17:33.971
I'm glad, Empire.

17:34.805 --> 17:37.099
It would be my honor
to be of any further assistance.

17:37.182 --> 17:39.643
You can be of further assistance

17:40.227 --> 17:45.023
in accepting my regret that I spoke to you
as I did the other day.

17:51.446 --> 17:52.990
Perfect symmetry here.

17:53.657 --> 17:55.409
Hedges trimmed every day.

17:56.201 --> 17:58.954
Foolish attempt to control
the uncontrollable.

18:05.836 --> 18:08.505
A plant will grow
in the direction of light…

18:10.174 --> 18:11.175
won't it?

18:12.259 --> 18:13.385
It will, Empire.

18:24.271 --> 18:26.523
I know I told you to get rid of those…

18:29.026 --> 18:30.027
but leave them.

18:31.236 --> 18:32.988
May the light never dim.

18:34.406 --> 18:35.616
I suspect it won't.

18:41.788 --> 18:46.126
When I summon you,
I expect you to arrive promptly.

18:47.377 --> 18:50.297
As you can see, I have a surprise for you.

18:50.881 --> 18:53.550
A challenge on your first time out.

18:53.634 --> 18:56.887
Ghillie raptors. Now, they blend
into their surroundings so well

18:56.970 --> 18:59.681
you can hardly find them,
let alone shoot them.

19:00.307 --> 19:03.685
Look for the movement, not the color.

19:04.811 --> 19:08.524
Under normal circumstances, Brother Day
would introduce you to the hunt.

19:08.607 --> 19:11.985
But since he's decided to buck tradition
and leave Trantor,

19:12.069 --> 19:14.321
that responsibility falls to me.

19:14.404 --> 19:16.365
-Have you heard from him?
-No.

19:16.949 --> 19:18.283
Neither will you.

19:19.660 --> 19:22.246
Consider it the rare opportunity

19:22.329 --> 19:25.958
for you to exercise your independence.

19:34.716 --> 19:36.218
First one of the day.

19:36.301 --> 19:39.304
I doubt you even saw that creature
before I shot--

19:46.436 --> 19:47.771
Lucky shot.

19:47.855 --> 19:48.856
It was.

19:49.523 --> 19:52.526
Give me the day,
and I'll mold that luck into skill.

19:53.110 --> 19:54.987
I'd rather mold it myself.

19:56.113 --> 19:58.824
Well then, good hunting to you.

19:59.992 --> 20:01.034
And to you.

20:05.998 --> 20:08.792
Four moons, she's heavy.

20:08.876 --> 20:10.335
-Poly?
-Oh, shit.

20:11.587 --> 20:12.921
Damn it, Poly. That hurt.

20:13.005 --> 20:14.256
Sorry.

20:15.632 --> 20:16.633
Where are we?

20:16.717 --> 20:18.135
Geothermal tunnels.

20:18.218 --> 20:20.345
We saw you in the brig
and dragged you out here.

20:21.221 --> 20:23.015
You're way heavier than you look.

20:26.351 --> 20:27.352
Thanks.

20:30.147 --> 20:31.148
Warden?

20:31.648 --> 20:32.900
What's an Invictus?

20:33.483 --> 20:34.735
Where'd you hear that name?

20:35.569 --> 20:39.573
Phara said it when she was with you.
It was the only word I could make out.

20:40.073 --> 20:43.327
It was a legendary destroyer.
But it disappeared centuries ago.

20:43.410 --> 20:44.786
It's like a ghost ship.

20:44.870 --> 20:47.706
Well, I think Phara's found it.

20:55.714 --> 20:58.217
-On the ground. On the ground!
-Get down. Get down.

20:58.842 --> 21:01.261
-Salvor.
-Dad. Dad.

21:01.345 --> 21:02.638
Hugo!

21:04.348 --> 21:06.683
-You too!
-Mayor Hardin.

21:07.976 --> 21:09.228
Thank Seldon.

21:09.311 --> 21:10.854
What are you doing here?

21:10.938 --> 21:13.232
The Anacreons recoded the fence,
locked us out.

21:13.315 --> 21:15.817
We figured the hulk was
as safe a place as any to hide.

21:15.901 --> 21:18.028
Told him it was one of the stops
on your nightly rounds.

21:18.111 --> 21:20.072
You can save all that pillow talk
for later.

21:20.155 --> 21:21.990
Right now, we need a plan
to get back inside.

21:22.074 --> 21:23.784
We're not going back.

21:23.867 --> 21:25.702
What do you mean, we're not going back?

21:28.163 --> 21:30.707
The Anacreon corvettes are
on the geothermal field.

21:30.791 --> 21:34.378
Forget the corvettes.
We need to protect the Foundation.

21:34.461 --> 21:36.964
This is about protecting the Foundation.

21:37.047 --> 21:40.884
Phara's after a warship. I think.
A planet-killer.

21:40.968 --> 21:43.929
If she gets her hands on it, she'll pull
the whole galaxy into conflict.

21:44.012 --> 21:46.306
This is the first Seldon Crisis.

21:46.890 --> 21:50.352
The Vault waking up now,
the instincts driving me…

21:52.062 --> 21:56.108
Hari put me here to stop the Anacreons,
and he's helping me figure out how.

21:57.025 --> 22:00.028
So I'm following those instincts,

22:00.112 --> 22:02.781
and we're taking out those corvettes.
Understood?

22:04.533 --> 22:05.951
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

22:06.034 --> 22:07.953
Not you two. You're staying here.

22:08.036 --> 22:09.288
But we saved you.

22:10.330 --> 22:12.040
And I'm grateful.

22:12.124 --> 22:13.750
But this is wild work,

22:13.834 --> 22:15.752
and I'm not having your blood on my hands.

22:28.891 --> 22:30.434
Esteemed Empire.

22:30.517 --> 22:33.937
I expected the clamoring masses
upon my arrival,

22:34.021 --> 22:36.732
but instead I'm greeted by a heretic.

22:36.815 --> 22:39.026
Profuse apologies, Empire.

22:39.109 --> 22:41.862
I assure you, a proper welcome awaits.

22:43.739 --> 22:46.033
May I present Zephyr Gilat.

22:46.950 --> 22:48.911
Triple blessings to you, Empire.

22:49.912 --> 22:51.830
The pleasure is mine, Zephyr.

22:52.331 --> 22:56.335
My condolences on the passing
of Proxima Opal.

22:56.418 --> 23:00.506
Thank you, Empire. It is a sad occasion,
but also a hopeful one.

23:00.589 --> 23:02.132
Especially for you.

23:02.216 --> 23:05.719
I shall gracefully accept whatever
the Ring of Zephyrs should decide.

23:05.802 --> 23:07.971
Tell us, what is your sense
of how they currently lean?

23:08.055 --> 23:11.391
Zephyr Gilat is still most likely
to be named Proxima.

23:11.475 --> 23:16.271
However, it will not take much
to tip things in a less desirable fashion.

23:16.355 --> 23:17.356
I understand.

23:19.107 --> 23:21.818
We want to help you
in whatever way we can.

23:21.902 --> 23:23.737
That is most generous.

23:23.820 --> 23:28.075
We cannot deny that Halima has
a natural charisma.

23:28.867 --> 23:32.412
I feel it is necessary for me
to offer something concrete.

23:32.496 --> 23:37.417
With all due respect, Empire,
the infrastructure's crumbling.

23:37.501 --> 23:40.796
Fresh water has long been expensive
and hard to come by.

23:40.879 --> 23:44.675
Something in this Halima
is quenching their thirst.

23:44.758 --> 23:47.010
I think we have a solution for that.

23:47.094 --> 23:51.181
We'll take Halima's metaphor
and make it literal.

23:55.811 --> 24:00.858
Zephyr Gilat, in honor of your rising
as the next Proxima,

24:00.941 --> 24:04.444
Empire will build a moon-wide
desalination system.

24:05.028 --> 24:09.074
Your people will never go
without clean drinking water again.

24:13.662 --> 24:16.582
I am without words, Empire.

24:17.875 --> 24:21.170
Triple blessings to you, Zephyr Gilat.

24:39.229 --> 24:40.230
You okay?

24:40.939 --> 24:43.275
I was not cut out for this wind.

24:43.859 --> 24:46.695
I spent those first years
with my fists clenched.

24:47.196 --> 24:48.363
One day your mother said,

24:48.447 --> 24:50.824
"Open your fists, man.
You can't punch the wind."

24:50.908 --> 24:53.160
You go on, Hugo. We'll catch up.

24:56.788 --> 25:01.001
Growing up on Trantor, childhood indoors…

25:02.628 --> 25:03.879
makes you soft.

25:05.255 --> 25:07.633
You never talk much about Trantor.

25:08.842 --> 25:10.010
What's the point?

25:10.886 --> 25:12.262
We're never going back there.

25:12.763 --> 25:14.014
Was it bad?

25:14.765 --> 25:17.601
On the contrary. It was incredible.

25:17.684 --> 25:21.522
Your grandparents worked the Star Bridge,
so we were pretty well-off.

25:22.147 --> 25:23.565
Miracles everywhere.

25:24.566 --> 25:26.693
Floating fountains,

25:26.777 --> 25:29.696
synchronized water shows with whales

25:29.780 --> 25:32.658
and things swimming
above your head in zero G.

25:33.367 --> 25:35.202
And the food-- Oh, my God.

25:35.285 --> 25:37.496
The finest everything.

25:38.121 --> 25:39.623
You think I'm fat now?

25:42.042 --> 25:43.585
But here's the thing, Sal.

25:45.587 --> 25:51.593
We knew it was built
on a mountain of lies and deception,

25:52.553 --> 25:55.138
a trillion people working
behind the scenes

25:55.222 --> 25:56.682
just to make everything shine.

25:56.765 --> 25:59.768
You scratch the surface of it,
and it just couldn't go on.

26:01.019 --> 26:03.856
And then Hari started making waves
about the collapse.

26:03.939 --> 26:07.484
You know, I couldn't make heads or tails
of anything he was saying.

26:07.568 --> 26:09.611
But you believed in the Plan.

26:09.695 --> 26:13.365
I believed in a girl named Mari Hardin,

26:13.448 --> 26:16.076
who I desperately wanted
to go to bed with.

26:16.159 --> 26:17.536
Dad.

26:19.496 --> 26:21.331
She believed in the Plan.

26:21.915 --> 26:23.834
You joined the Foundation for a girl?

26:23.917 --> 26:25.377
I did.

26:25.460 --> 26:28.005
Do you ever regret it? Coming here?

26:32.301 --> 26:34.303
I got you out of it, didn't I?

26:35.262 --> 26:36.263
Come on.

27:00.746 --> 27:02.247
That does not look good.

27:08.837 --> 27:11.340
They're setting charges
around the hydro-cells.

27:11.423 --> 27:12.966
It'll destroy the entire city.

27:13.759 --> 27:16.053
We need to throw a very large wrench
into the works.

27:18.847 --> 27:22.059
If I could get closer, I could snipe
one of those explosive disks,

27:22.559 --> 27:24.645
maybe take out a corvette or two.

27:26.813 --> 27:29.483
A better shot could keep her distance
and take out all three.

27:29.566 --> 27:30.651
Salvor.

27:30.734 --> 27:32.486
No. Nothing doing, Dad.

27:32.569 --> 27:34.696
You're too old, too fat,
and your eyesight's for shit.

27:34.780 --> 27:35.906
You'll never make it.

27:36.907 --> 27:39.284
You are definitely your mother's daughter.

27:53.173 --> 27:55.676
Your focus and skill
are extraordinary, Empire.

27:56.426 --> 27:57.845
Six kills.

27:57.928 --> 28:01.765
Brother Dusk will be impressed.
You've broken his record.

28:01.849 --> 28:03.183
How many did he kill?

28:03.267 --> 28:04.977
On his best hunt, three.

28:05.060 --> 28:06.728
And after a good deal of practice.

28:08.146 --> 28:10.023
Sneaky bastard.

28:11.275 --> 28:12.818
That would have made four.

28:13.402 --> 28:16.071
Throw these into the bushes.
Take them now. I killed three.

28:16.947 --> 28:18.949
I killed three. Do you understand? Go!

28:22.953 --> 28:25.664
Brother Dawn, how was your hunt?

28:26.623 --> 28:27.624
Three.

28:27.708 --> 28:30.335
You matched my record
on your first attempt.

28:30.419 --> 28:31.962
Romus helped considerably.

28:32.838 --> 28:34.339
Exceptional work, Brother Dawn.

28:34.423 --> 28:36.133
You're a natural hunter.

28:36.633 --> 28:37.759
Here, to celebrate.

28:45.517 --> 28:49.605
Well, you hunt like a man.
Do you consider yourself a man now?

28:50.564 --> 28:52.816
I don't know. I suppose?

28:52.900 --> 28:56.361
Only a man can replace the man.

28:58.655 --> 29:01.867
I think it's time you paid a visit
to Gossamer Court.

29:03.702 --> 29:07.664
The business of Empire is challenging.

29:07.748 --> 29:10.042
And we are human, after all.

29:10.125 --> 29:15.380
We need to voice our fears,
our hatreds, our resentments.

29:16.006 --> 29:18.842
Their memories are wiped clean
before they leave Trantor.

29:18.926 --> 29:21.845
Cleon I developed the system.

29:21.929 --> 29:23.180
It's perfect, really.

29:24.181 --> 29:25.182
So?

29:27.726 --> 29:29.228
Which one would you like?

29:33.857 --> 29:36.568
What pleasures do you seek, Empire?

29:36.652 --> 29:38.445
You'll have no memory of this?

29:40.155 --> 29:42.407
None that will endure
past the night, Empire.

29:43.492 --> 29:46.870
I could say anything to you,

29:47.621 --> 29:49.122
and you won't remember tomorrow?

29:49.206 --> 29:50.374
That's correct.

29:51.083 --> 29:52.751
And that doesn't bother you?

29:53.752 --> 29:55.879
Memories of this liaison are not
my possession.

29:56.672 --> 29:58.215
They belong to Empire.

30:05.681 --> 30:09.726
Do you care for the pleasure of discourse?
I'm conversant in many subjects.

30:24.825 --> 30:25.868
Turn away.

30:39.965 --> 30:41.633
I'll tell them you did well.

30:43.677 --> 30:47.222
And as far as you'll remember, you did.

30:49.016 --> 30:50.559
He didn't touch me.

30:51.560 --> 30:53.020
What did he do then?

30:54.980 --> 30:56.064
He just talked.

30:58.734 --> 31:00.569
Tell me everything he said.

31:10.996 --> 31:12.247
You good, Sal?

31:12.831 --> 31:14.166
Almost in range now.

31:14.249 --> 31:16.502
Just need to take a wind reading
and I'm good to go.

31:36.396 --> 31:38.273
Salvor? Sal?

31:39.775 --> 31:41.193
-It's happened again.
-What?

31:41.276 --> 31:43.487
It's a mind-slip, seizure, something.

31:44.321 --> 31:46.448
If we don't pull her back,
they'll spot her.

31:46.532 --> 31:49.868
You get Salvor. I'll get the corvettes.

31:54.164 --> 31:57.626
There's only one scenario
in which you leave the ship as planned,

31:57.709 --> 32:02.130
and that's the one in which it becomes
impossible for you to remain on board.

32:02.214 --> 32:04.299
I don't take my life.

32:06.635 --> 32:07.678
You do.

32:08.679 --> 32:11.098
You're Hari Seldon. You can fix this.

32:11.181 --> 32:12.975
I'm telling you I can't.

32:13.058 --> 32:14.393
Don't you see?

32:14.476 --> 32:20.357
This whole thing collapses
because you stay with her.

32:21.191 --> 32:25.320
And everything everyone has sacrificed,
all wasted.

32:26.029 --> 32:28.240
You know what I'm saying is true.

32:29.533 --> 32:30.868
Do you trust the math?

32:31.952 --> 32:33.120
I hate the math.

32:33.912 --> 32:35.205
Do you trust me?

32:35.706 --> 32:37.499
I wish I'd never met you,

32:38.000 --> 32:40.043
never stolen your damn books.

32:41.128 --> 32:42.212
But you did.

32:43.046 --> 32:45.174
And we are here now,

32:45.841 --> 32:50.637
an entire galaxy pivoting around
the actions of an individual. You.

32:58.270 --> 33:01.773
Go straight to the cryo-pod.
It's programmed for you.

33:01.857 --> 33:04.318
And don't stop to say goodbye to her.

33:05.694 --> 33:07.487
Don't implicate her in this.

33:28.550 --> 33:30.093
Salvor?

33:32.095 --> 33:34.723
-It happened again.
-I know. Can you shoot?

33:34.806 --> 33:36.642
-Yeah.
-Then go. Go.

34:02.543 --> 34:04.211
Where's my dad?

34:04.294 --> 34:06.755
Gone for the corvettes.
He went in after you dropped.

34:09.174 --> 34:10.551
He won't make it.

34:16.723 --> 34:18.225
There are too many.

34:47.379 --> 34:49.715
Keep covering me, Sal.
I'll take out those ships.

34:49.797 --> 34:51.592
No, Dad. No.

35:12.446 --> 35:13.947
Help!

35:15.282 --> 35:16.283
Dad!

35:22.623 --> 35:24.958
Salvor Hardin, Warden of Terminus.

35:25.042 --> 35:28.045
-Dad.
-You have to protect the Plan.

35:28.128 --> 35:29.671
Dad, please.

35:57.533 --> 35:59.326
Open your fists, Salvor.

36:03.580 --> 36:04.998
No, Daddy!

36:05.082 --> 36:06.792
Don't fight the wind.

36:12.714 --> 36:14.925
Daddy!

36:16.134 --> 36:17.135
No.

36:18.554 --> 36:20.722
No.

36:40.742 --> 36:42.870
You should see the view from up here.

36:48.917 --> 36:51.295
Empire, I shouldn't be here.

36:53.881 --> 36:56.008
Come. It's all right.

37:08.020 --> 37:09.354
Thought you might like that.

37:25.662 --> 37:26.747
Parterres.

37:28.874 --> 37:29.917
Walkways.

37:31.627 --> 37:32.669
Grand lawn.

37:35.088 --> 37:38.425
Look how precise they are, how neat.

37:39.426 --> 37:41.011
Everything in its place.

37:43.805 --> 37:45.015
I've always loved that.

37:48.143 --> 37:49.770
Come see it from here.

37:57.486 --> 37:59.738
I don't have a force field, Empire.

38:02.157 --> 38:03.242
You do now.

38:18.715 --> 38:19.800
Take it.

38:22.511 --> 38:23.637
I won't if you're not.

38:32.563 --> 38:33.772
It's beautiful.

38:36.108 --> 38:38.110
If you can see beauty, it is.

38:39.987 --> 38:41.280
Tell me what those are.

38:44.491 --> 38:45.659
The rose garden?

38:46.952 --> 38:49.705
Rosa arvensis, then Rosa persica.

38:49.788 --> 38:52.165
-Rosa kordesii--
-Their colors.

38:53.208 --> 38:54.501
White and yellow.

38:55.335 --> 38:57.629
A bright yellow with a dark red center,

38:59.131 --> 39:01.258
and a deep, brilliant red.

39:01.341 --> 39:03.844
What else is that color? That red.

39:05.053 --> 39:06.305
In nature?

39:07.139 --> 39:08.765
The scarlet maple tree.

39:09.808 --> 39:11.476
The summer tanager bird.

39:12.269 --> 39:13.979
The shell of the red crab.

39:14.771 --> 39:16.106
Red sandalwood.

39:20.694 --> 39:22.905
I wasn't aware Empire was color-blind.

39:24.656 --> 39:26.116
Empire isn't.

39:26.200 --> 39:28.243
Cleons are exact replicas.

39:29.161 --> 39:31.205
None has ever been color-blind…

39:34.166 --> 39:35.167
before me.

39:36.460 --> 39:37.920
Isn't it fairly common in men?

39:39.338 --> 39:41.006
There are simple ways to correct it.

39:41.089 --> 39:42.424
It's not common to us.

39:44.843 --> 39:46.261
And none of it's simple.

39:48.013 --> 39:49.223
That's my secret.

39:51.892 --> 39:53.143
And now you know it.

39:56.063 --> 39:57.314
Now what do I do?

40:09.660 --> 40:13.413
If I were trying to keep a secret,
I'd push me off.

40:13.497 --> 40:15.999
It's the safest way to ensure my silence.

40:24.842 --> 40:25.926
You could push me.

41:38.415 --> 41:39.666
Sal.

41:42.085 --> 41:44.087
He joined the Foundation for a girl.

41:48.383 --> 41:49.551
Isn't that strange?

41:51.678 --> 41:53.472
He believed in the end, but…

41:55.599 --> 41:57.351
he did it all for my mom.

42:02.314 --> 42:03.607
I'm so sorry.

42:12.449 --> 42:14.117
I screwed up, Hugo.

42:15.744 --> 42:18.413
If I hadn't blacked out,
my father would still be alive.

42:18.497 --> 42:19.957
No.

42:20.541 --> 42:24.461
I was just so certain
taking their ships was the right play.

42:24.545 --> 42:25.754
Maybe it was.

42:26.505 --> 42:28.131
Maybe the other plays were worse.

42:30.133 --> 42:33.303
And Hari said--
He said an entire galaxy can pivot

42:33.387 --> 42:35.430
around the actions of an individual.

42:36.014 --> 42:38.141
So then you are
one of those individuals, right?

42:38.767 --> 42:40.894
Hari is guiding you
to keep the Plan on course.

42:42.521 --> 42:45.691
Because I'm, what? Special?

42:47.317 --> 42:50.153
The Anacreons took the city
because of me--

42:50.237 --> 42:53.740
No. They took it because of Lewis
and the idiots in the tower.

42:55.826 --> 42:57.995
And right now
the only chance the Foundation has

42:58.078 --> 43:00.205
of surviving this crisis is you.

43:01.915 --> 43:03.542
I don't care about the crisis.

43:04.459 --> 43:06.503
All I care about is making Phara pay.

43:08.213 --> 43:09.548
We just blew up her ships.

43:09.631 --> 43:11.508
Your rig's the only way off planet now.

43:11.592 --> 43:14.595
We get to the Beggar before they do,
they are stranded. Come on.

43:24.563 --> 43:29.193
As we mourn Proxima Opal's
compassion and her strength,

43:29.776 --> 43:32.237
let us be grateful for her many blessings.

43:33.238 --> 43:36.325
In honor of Opal's passage to rebirth,

43:36.408 --> 43:40.120
and as a gesture of faith
to our next Proxima,

43:40.204 --> 43:46.877
our esteemed Empire will be installing
a moon-wide desalination system.

43:51.715 --> 43:54.301
Let us now praise Empire

43:54.384 --> 43:58.388
and turn to the words of the New Octavo.

44:01.183 --> 44:03.727
"With the gifts of our protectors…

44:05.604 --> 44:06.772
our hearts…

44:11.235 --> 44:16.073
our hearts are multiplied
and our spirits emboldened.

44:16.156 --> 44:20.160
By the will of their souls
aligned with ours…

44:23.455 --> 44:24.581
our path"--

44:33.799 --> 44:36.426
Zephyr Gilat speaks holy words,

44:37.553 --> 44:39.221
and we thank her for them.

44:42.933 --> 44:45.477
We extend our gratitude to the Empire.

44:46.186 --> 44:50.232
As we celebrate Proxima Opal's
passage to her next life,

44:51.191 --> 44:54.987
let us take a moment to be grateful
for the Mother's gift,

44:56.029 --> 44:58.323
the gift of rebirth.

45:00.826 --> 45:03.871
There was a time, millennia ago,

45:04.997 --> 45:07.708
when our souls were like wax candles.

45:07.791 --> 45:10.544
They burned through once,
and then they were snuffed out.

45:11.461 --> 45:14.923
But the Mother looked down
and saw that this was insufficient.

45:15.966 --> 45:19.136
A single life in a single body,

45:20.137 --> 45:22.347
raised in a single world,

45:23.599 --> 45:29.438
such a soul had no foothold to climb
from the trenches of ignorance

45:30.105 --> 45:32.232
to grow into holiness.

45:33.233 --> 45:37.362
And so the Mother took
that straight line of life

45:37.446 --> 45:39.865
and shaped it into a circle,

45:40.490 --> 45:43.660
bestowing upon us the gift of rebirth.

45:45.078 --> 45:46.788
But what does this gift mean?

45:47.289 --> 45:49.958
Some believe the purpose of reincarnation

45:50.042 --> 45:53.712
is to ascend to the highest planes
of enlightenment.

45:55.255 --> 45:57.049
But we know better, don't we?

45:57.132 --> 46:00.302
For there is no end to this journey.

46:01.094 --> 46:03.430
For our capacity for growth

46:04.681 --> 46:06.350
is infinite.

46:07.768 --> 46:12.064
Even a soul that appeared holy
400 years ago

46:13.273 --> 46:16.068
would not be holy today.

46:17.486 --> 46:19.988
This is the Mother's lesson.

46:20.572 --> 46:23.158
As the galaxy changes, so must we.

46:23.825 --> 46:28.038
We must embrace
the value of transformation,

46:28.121 --> 46:29.748
of evolution,

46:30.791 --> 46:32.459
of difference.

46:32.543 --> 46:35.420
The greatest failure of humanity,

46:35.504 --> 46:39.299
the greatest sin against the Mother,
is stagnation.

46:40.801 --> 46:42.636
And so we rejoice

46:43.428 --> 46:48.725
that Proxima Opal's soul will not stagnate
and rust into corruption.

46:49.560 --> 46:54.940
We rejoice that her soul is not bound
to a single, immutable body.

46:56.316 --> 47:00.445
We rejoice that her soul is
an ever-transformative, evolving soul.

47:06.785 --> 47:09.496
Our lives in these bodies may be brief…

47:11.290 --> 47:14.209
but our souls are endless.

47:14.293 --> 47:19.590
And as we shape and sculpt our souls
into a never-ending quest for holiness,

47:19.673 --> 47:20.799
remember this.

47:21.800 --> 47:27.598
This will not always be your life.
But it is your life now.

47:28.307 --> 47:30.851
Your choice now.

47:31.894 --> 47:35.022
Your change now.

47:35.981 --> 47:37.357
Make it count!

47:41.528 --> 47:42.738
To the Mother!

47:42.821 --> 47:44.239
To the Mother!
