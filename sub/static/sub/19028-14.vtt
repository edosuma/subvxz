00:02.836 --> 00:05.430
<i>When a terminal patient
seems to have given up,</i>

00:05.672 --> 00:08.232
<i>a good doctor will try anything
to keep them going.</i>

00:08.466 --> 00:11.299
Betty, there's got to be something
I can do to cheer you up.

00:11.553 --> 00:13.464
I just wish I could see my dog.

00:13.930 --> 00:15.807
So I'd just bring the dog in
for a quick visit.

00:16.015 --> 00:18.166
It would mean the world to her.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.524
<i>Ever since Elliot
went into private practise,</i>

00:20.729 --> 00:23.084
<i>Dr Kelso refused to speak to her.</i>

00:23.314 --> 00:24.542
<i>He wouldn't say hello.</i>

00:24.733 --> 00:26.291
Good morning, Dr Kelso.

00:27.944 --> 00:30.697
<i>He wouldn't even say,
"Watch out for that bucket. "</i>

00:30.947 --> 00:33.097
See you. I've got to go
give an endocrinology lecture.

00:35.535 --> 00:36.934
I got you.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.110
My bad.

00:42.292 --> 00:44.681
<i>But Elliot didn't let it get to her.</i>

00:45.337 --> 00:48.568
Okay, let's talk
about ectopic ACTH-secreting tumors.

00:48.965 --> 00:50.683
Guys, cell phones off, please.

00:51.968 --> 00:55.165
<i>She didn't help things
by bringing up Kelso's dead dog.</i>

00:55.430 --> 00:59.139
Oh, come on, you brought Baxter
to the hospital when he was alive.

00:59.434 --> 01:01.390
Did you want to ask me something?

01:01.603 --> 01:04.480
Can a doctor bring a patient's dog
into the hospital for a visit?

01:04.730 --> 01:06.767
I'm going to say the same thing
I said to my new gardener

01:06.983 --> 01:09.736
when he asked me for Easter off.
"No way, Jose. "

01:09.986 --> 01:12.454
His name's actually Jose.
That's why I hired him.

01:13.740 --> 01:16.254
Look, so we just hired a new nanny,
and she is super hot.

01:16.493 --> 01:18.961
Please don't make a big deal
out of this, or Carla will go crazy.

01:19.204 --> 01:23.277
Turk, who are you talking to?
I've seen a lot of hot girls. I know how...

01:28.004 --> 01:29.323
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

01:29.756 --> 01:31.428
We're going for a run with Izzy.

01:31.633 --> 01:33.942
- Oh, J.D., this is Heather.
- Hi, how are you?

01:34.177 --> 01:35.292
What's up?

01:35.470 --> 01:37.062
Oh, my God, she's so hot,
I have to go hug her "hello. "

01:37.263 --> 01:39.094
- Keep it together.
- I can't, I'm gonna make a scene.

01:39.307 --> 01:40.820
Just grab my leg. Grab my leg.

01:41.601 --> 01:42.829
See you later.

01:45.772 --> 01:47.330
- I'm light-headed.
- I can't feel my leg.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.480
- I'm light-headed.
- I can't feel my...

01:50.068 --> 01:51.865
You know what, it's too dark out.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.751
I just realised, this tank top's
a little see-through.

01:57.367 --> 01:58.356
Go ahead.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:18.430 --> 02:20.819
Thank you so much for helping me
sneak Boomer in, Janitor.

02:21.057 --> 02:22.854
No problem. Here you go, boy.

02:23.059 --> 02:25.175
- Okay, boy, okay.
- Oh, what a good boy!

02:25.395 --> 02:27.863
Wait, what happened
to all of your cleaning supplies?

02:28.106 --> 02:29.937
Actually, that's a very funny story.

02:31.484 --> 02:32.519
And?

02:32.694 --> 02:34.491
Nothing. I'm just looking
at my cleaning supplies.

02:34.696 --> 02:37.927
I got drunk last night
and threw them up in that tree.

02:39.492 --> 02:42.086
Anyway, let's do this. Just stay cool.

02:42.328 --> 02:43.477
No problemo.

02:44.956 --> 02:46.753
Top of the morning,
Dr Walter Mickhead.

02:46.958 --> 02:49.711
Snoop Dogg Resident,
when we hitting the clubs, yo?

02:49.961 --> 02:52.873
Oh, Colonel Doctor,
that tie looks finger-lickin' good.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.368
Wow, so natural.
Did you act in college?

02:55.592 --> 02:57.230
- I did, thank you.
- I can tell.

02:57.427 --> 02:59.895
Hey, Carla. Check it out.

03:00.972 --> 03:03.770
- He's so cute!
- Heads up, here comes trouble.

03:05.602 --> 03:06.717
Oh, no. Don't worry.

03:06.895 --> 03:09.807
Dr Kelso never makes eye contact
with the patients.

03:10.065 --> 03:11.418
Morning, sir.

03:19.532 --> 03:21.409
Right. Hello again, sir.

03:22.702 --> 03:24.454
Nice job, Mr Berkland.

03:26.498 --> 03:29.535
<i>Since Jordan had pre-natal surgery,
she'd been on bed rest.</i>

03:29.793 --> 03:31.067
<i>Dr Cox, however, was not.</i>

03:31.252 --> 03:34.562
Okay, I made you breakfast,
the kitchen's as clean as a whistle,

03:34.839 --> 03:37.114
I'm gonna drop Jack off at daycare
on the way to work.

03:37.342 --> 03:39.731
Is there anything else I can do for you?

03:39.969 --> 03:41.448
I need you to go to the video store

03:41.638 --> 03:43.993
and get me anything
with Viggo something-sen.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.897
I need white chocolate,
strawberry seltzer, peppercorn brie

03:47.143 --> 03:49.099
and a Polaroid of the tomato plant
that I planted last spring

03:49.312 --> 03:51.268
because I'm worried it may have snails.

03:51.481 --> 03:53.597
Oh, and if you see that neighbour,
Lena, from down the hall,

03:53.817 --> 03:56.206
I want you to roll your eyes and
say the word "slut" under your breath,

03:56.444 --> 03:58.002
but loud enough so she can hear.

03:58.196 --> 03:59.948
And don't forget to be home by 6:30

04:00.156 --> 04:02.954
because you gotta give Jack his bath
before you make my dinner.

04:03.201 --> 04:05.840
But when will I have time to kill myself?

04:06.121 --> 04:07.873
That's not my problem.

04:10.583 --> 04:12.414
You know what sucks
about having a hot nanny?

04:12.627 --> 04:15.460
I can't even look at Heather
without Carla going ballistic.

04:15.714 --> 04:17.944
Sceptical air-five.

04:18.173 --> 04:19.322
She can't be that hot.

04:19.509 --> 04:22.819
Oh, really? Because I just so happen
to have a video from my nanny-cam

04:23.096 --> 04:24.814
that begs to differ.

04:25.015 --> 04:27.290
My mom put a nanny-cam
in our bathroom.

04:27.517 --> 04:29.667
She said my baths were too long.

04:32.397 --> 04:33.830
Fire up the smut.

04:35.233 --> 04:37.144
How did you assemble everybody
so quickly?

04:37.360 --> 04:38.839
Oh, I got the word out.

04:41.906 --> 04:46.775
Booby!

04:47.245 --> 04:50.954
Booby!

04:51.333 --> 04:54.769
Booby!

04:55.962 --> 04:57.918
We did everything we could
for your mom,

04:58.131 --> 04:59.689
but sometimes life just...

04:59.883 --> 05:01.396
Booby!

05:01.593 --> 05:03.345
Got to go. Booby horn.

05:06.890 --> 05:08.403
<i>Here they come!</i>

05:14.689 --> 05:17.487
God, Keith and I haven't had sex
in so long.

05:17.734 --> 05:20.328
Okay, you said the same thing when
you saw me changing Izzy's diaper.

05:20.570 --> 05:22.526
What are you and Keith
doing to each other?

05:22.739 --> 05:25.458
Oh, thank you so much, Dr Reid.

05:27.077 --> 05:29.033
Can you believe
how different she looks?

05:29.245 --> 05:32.078
I mean, thanks to Boomer, Betty has
more energy, her vitals have improved.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.892
If we keep this up, she might even
get home and have a few more months.

05:35.126 --> 05:36.400
Move.

05:36.961 --> 05:38.235
What's up your butt?

05:38.421 --> 05:40.776
Yeah, what is all up in there?

05:41.007 --> 05:44.158
Why don't you hop aboard the
What's-up-Dr. -Cox's-butt Trolley,

05:44.427 --> 05:46.497
and we can begin our tour.

05:46.721 --> 05:50.077
Coming up on the left is my bloated,
bed-ridden ex-wife

05:50.350 --> 05:52.625
who's not allowed to lift a finger, which,

05:52.852 --> 05:56.083
thankfully, leaves it
all up to these guys.

05:56.356 --> 05:59.666
Now, if you'll look to your right,
you'll see my waning libido,

05:59.943 --> 06:02.377
my crushed soul
and my very last nerve,

06:02.612 --> 06:06.002
which I would advise you not to get on,
under or even close to.

06:06.282 --> 06:08.921
Does it help to know
that Jesus loves you?

06:09.202 --> 06:10.521
It does not.

06:10.870 --> 06:13.179
Well, everything happens for a reason.

06:13.415 --> 06:14.894
Are you really trying to tell me

06:15.083 --> 06:18.359
that things like New Orleans, AIDS,
sugar-free ice cream, crack babies,

06:18.628 --> 06:21.381
Hugh Jackman and cancer
all happen for a reason?

06:21.631 --> 06:25.021
Because I'm sorry, I'm...
I'm just not buying that.

06:25.552 --> 06:29.670
"God works all things for good. "
Romans, 8:28.

06:30.348 --> 06:31.701
Bull dinky.

06:31.933 --> 06:35.130
Perry Cox, 6'1 ".
A buck eighty-five after lunch.

06:40.191 --> 06:43.024
<i>What's the matter? You're so fussy.</i>

06:43.695 --> 06:45.367
<i>Why are you so fussy?</i>

06:45.947 --> 06:49.735
I'd let her give me a bath,
I don't care if my mom was watching.

06:51.327 --> 06:53.443
Could you make her eat a banana?

06:53.830 --> 06:55.786
It's not interactive, Todd.

06:57.042 --> 06:58.316
<i>There it is!</i>

06:58.918 --> 07:00.636
<i>There it is, let me...</i>

07:02.714 --> 07:03.863
Hey, baby!

07:04.049 --> 07:05.846
- What are you guys watching?
- Football.

07:06.051 --> 07:07.643
- Yeah, football.
- Yeah, football.

07:07.844 --> 07:09.755
- Good game, good game.
- Football. Yeah.

07:12.474 --> 07:14.669
Football? Isn't the season over?

07:14.893 --> 07:18.169
<i>And then every male in the room
fell totally in sync,</i>

07:18.438 --> 07:20.906
<i>resulting in the rarest
of all phenomenon,</i>

07:21.149 --> 07:23.617
<i>the seamless, collaborative guy-lie.</i>

07:23.860 --> 07:26.932
The American season is over.
We were watching Mexican football.

07:27.197 --> 07:29.711
- They started late this year.
- Because of the churro vendors.

07:29.949 --> 07:32.622
They went on strike and the players
wouldn't cross the picket line.

07:32.869 --> 07:36.225
When the dispute turned violent,
they called in Rodrigo Vasquez,

07:36.498 --> 07:38.648
the owner of the Baja Banditos,
to step in.

07:38.875 --> 07:42.993
Thanks to Senor Vasquez's experience
dealing with the fruit-pickers' unions,

07:43.296 --> 07:46.766
he was able to broker a last-minute
deal, and the season was salvaged.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.539
And that's why
we're watching football in the spring.

07:50.804 --> 07:51.998
Whatever.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.869
<i>And then Turk gave us
the slightest of nods,</i>

07:55.100 --> 07:59.537
<i>which was the universal man-sign for,
"Well done, men. She'll never know. "</i>

08:06.444 --> 08:08.116
Turk, what the hell?

08:10.323 --> 08:13.360
Janitor, thank you so much for helping
me sneak Boomer in again today.

08:13.618 --> 08:16.894
No problem. I once snuck a mongoose
in this thing to kill all the snakes.

08:17.163 --> 08:20.314
- Why were there snakes in here?
- I snuck them in to kill all the mice.

08:20.583 --> 08:21.902
Where's the disinfectant, Lurch?

08:22.085 --> 08:25.361
I spilled soda on my desk this morning,
and now it's all sticky.

08:25.630 --> 08:28.144
Well, I'm all out. Here, use this.

08:28.383 --> 08:30.977
You want me to clean soda with soda?

08:31.219 --> 08:32.890
Are you questioning the way
I do my job?

08:33.096 --> 08:35.735
Did I question you when you did
iliac bone marrow autopsy

08:35.974 --> 08:38.568
and failed to anesthetise
the periosteum adequately?

08:38.809 --> 08:41.119
No. No, you didn't.

08:43.940 --> 08:47.216
Hey, the little fellow
figured out the latch.

08:47.485 --> 08:48.964
Just like the snakes.

08:50.989 --> 08:54.902
Well, if it isn't Nurse
"Everything Happens For A Reason. "

08:55.702 --> 08:57.412
Oh, gosh darn it!

08:57.996 --> 08:59.793
I went ahead and spilled a little coffee.

08:59.998 --> 09:02.558
I wonder what the reason was for that?

09:06.087 --> 09:09.079
Okay, I am not moving
until you at least offer to help me up.

09:09.341 --> 09:12.617
There is no rhyme or reason
to anything,

09:12.886 --> 09:14.604
why can't you just get that?

09:14.804 --> 09:18.035
Why is it so important that
everyone believes what you do?

09:18.308 --> 09:21.539
Because I'm right,
and I'm the only one with any proof.

09:22.228 --> 09:23.707
I'm still down here!

09:23.897 --> 09:26.889
You don't need proof when
the good Lord fills your heart with faith.

09:27.150 --> 09:28.378
Oh, my God.

09:29.861 --> 09:31.613
Thank you for that, Noelle.

09:31.821 --> 09:34.494
You can keep on huffing and puffing
all you want to,

09:34.741 --> 09:37.050
you're never gonna change
the way I feel.

09:37.285 --> 09:39.640
Oh, please! I am so angry right now...

09:39.871 --> 09:42.339
You know what?
We're no longer speaking!

09:43.958 --> 09:45.755
Guys, I need some help over here.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.315
<i>There are lots of different ways
to win an argument.</i>

09:48.546 --> 09:50.059
<i>You can win it with an ultimatum.</i>

09:50.256 --> 09:53.328
I interviewed 23 girls
until I found Heather,

09:53.593 --> 09:57.711
but if I ever catch you eyeballing her
again, I will fire her tight little butt.

09:58.014 --> 10:00.403
And then you'll get to spend
every waking moment

10:00.642 --> 10:03.110
interviewing the next 23
fugly-ass candidates

10:03.353 --> 10:05.344
until we find another good one.

10:07.190 --> 10:09.101
<i>You can try to win it with logic.</i>

10:09.317 --> 10:11.672
Tell Dr Kelso that I know
it's against hospital policy

10:11.903 --> 10:14.861
but that this dog has literally
helped keep Mrs Dombrow alive.

10:17.075 --> 10:20.067
Mrs Dombrow passed away
this morning at 4:00 a. m.

10:20.328 --> 10:24.082
Tell Dr Reid there will be
consequences for her insubordination,

10:24.374 --> 10:25.807
and say it with this face.

10:29.212 --> 10:30.486
<i>But the best way to win an argument</i>

10:30.672 --> 10:32.708
<i>is to simply
leave your opponent speechless.</i>

10:32.924 --> 10:35.358
Patient was stabbed by a guy
in a grocery store.

10:35.593 --> 10:37.424
She's eight years old.

10:38.513 --> 10:41.630
Why don't you go ahead
and tell me what the reason is for this?

10:45.520 --> 10:47.476
Then...

10:48.064 --> 10:51.136
I blew Laverne's argument
clean out of the water when I asked her

10:51.401 --> 10:53.915
why an eight-year-old got knifed.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.382
Oh, my God, that is so lucky.

10:55.572 --> 11:00.282
I know. I was thrilled, but then
Laverne ruined everything.

11:01.578 --> 11:03.534
There's a reason for this.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.548
God's gonna show us eventually.

11:06.624 --> 11:07.898
It's infuriating.

11:08.084 --> 11:09.642
I must break her.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.626
That feels so good.

11:14.132 --> 11:16.123
I can't believe
I'm about to say this, Per,

11:16.343 --> 11:20.575
but what the hell. You know how
I can never use the word "love"

11:20.889 --> 11:22.083
except in a sarcastic way,

11:22.265 --> 11:26.941
like, "I love other people's kids,"
or, "I love that haircut!"

11:27.270 --> 11:29.500
By the way, love that haircut, Per!

11:29.731 --> 11:31.130
Everybody does.

11:32.108 --> 11:35.418
I just wanted to let you know that

11:36.529 --> 11:40.966
you've really been there for me
these past few weeks, and

11:43.453 --> 11:45.489
I'm really glad I have you.

11:47.582 --> 11:49.573
That was embarrassing for you.

11:49.793 --> 11:51.590
I know, and I don't care.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.452
What's he smiling about?

11:58.635 --> 11:59.988
Because of the dog thing,

12:00.178 --> 12:02.692
Dr Kelso wants me to tell you
that he has informed your office

12:02.931 --> 12:06.048
that you're temporarily suspended
from practicing at Sacred Heart.

12:06.309 --> 12:08.777
Just so you know,
I told him he was being ridiculous.

12:09.020 --> 12:10.055
What did he say?

12:10.230 --> 12:12.619
He said, "Careful, Jumpsuit.
Who signs your paychecks?"

12:12.857 --> 12:16.167
And I said, "I don't know. The Chief
Accountant, Charles Fickinson

12:16.444 --> 12:18.002
"or Dickinson or something,
I can't read the signature.

12:18.196 --> 12:21.154
"And, for the hundredth time, this is not
a jumpsuit, it's a shirt and a pants.

12:21.408 --> 12:22.727
"Who wears a belt with a jumpsuit?"

12:22.909 --> 12:25.582
- And he says, "I may not have the... "
- Random nurse,

12:25.829 --> 12:28.582
could you please send out a memo
that unauthorised personnel

12:28.832 --> 12:31.062
are not allowed in the hospital?

12:35.296 --> 12:36.411
Oh, here's Heather.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.547
Why don't you look away and think
about the kind of husband you are?

12:39.801 --> 12:41.917
Look who's here, Izzy.

12:42.137 --> 12:45.334
She's been a little fussy, so I'm going
to walk her to the car with you, okay?

12:45.598 --> 12:46.826
- See you, Mr Turk.
- See you.

12:47.017 --> 12:51.135
You know, Heather? I actually have
a little nanny-related question.

12:52.105 --> 12:55.859
Does a spoonful of sugar
really make the medicine go down?

12:56.693 --> 12:58.809
You know what? Sometimes it does.

12:59.029 --> 13:02.226
<i>That was totally worth the six hours
I spent last night writing that.</i>

13:02.490 --> 13:04.799
All right, look,
I need you to do me a solid.

13:05.035 --> 13:06.309
Ask Heather out on a date.

13:06.494 --> 13:08.962
Don't worry, buddy.
You know how I roll.

13:09.205 --> 13:12.720
I start with a couple off-the-cuff jokes
just like that one.

13:13.001 --> 13:15.435
Next up, I need you to find out
if she's allergic to anything.

13:15.670 --> 13:17.626
That way,
I'll say I'm allergic to the same thing.

13:17.839 --> 13:21.388
Women love that. "Gluten! Me, too!
We can eat together. "

13:21.676 --> 13:24.668
Thirdly, if I lose
a patient, I'll be able to cry

13:24.929 --> 13:27.204
<i>like I just watched
Extreme Home Makeover.</i>

13:27.432 --> 13:29.388
If everything goes according to plan,

13:29.601 --> 13:31.831
I should be out with her on a casual,

13:32.062 --> 13:35.577
not-a-real-date, just-two-friends-
having-a-beer-talking-about-their-lives

13:35.857 --> 13:38.166
thing in about seven to nine weeks.

13:38.401 --> 13:40.153
I need you to ask her
on a date right now.

13:40.362 --> 13:43.320
I never told you this before,
but any time you hook up with a chick,

13:43.573 --> 13:45.450
she automatically becomes
hideous to me.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.455
- Really?
- Hey, guys.

13:50.580 --> 13:53.811
- Have you seen Carla?
- Yeah, she just went outside.

13:54.084 --> 13:57.474
Thanks. I'm having
a horrible fricking day.

13:57.754 --> 13:58.982
I'll say.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.179
You don't see that?

14:06.930 --> 14:10.559
Laverne, excuse me, this is...
This is Mr Peterson.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.522
He's that young lady's father.

14:12.727 --> 14:16.561
As you can imagine, he's having
a pretty tough time with all of this.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.324
And since you believe that everything
happens for a reason,

14:19.567 --> 14:23.401
I was hoping you'd be able
to tell him why this happened.

14:24.280 --> 14:27.113
That's not her dad.
That's the delivery guy in a sweater.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.437
- My name's Lloyd.
- Stay in character.

14:29.661 --> 14:31.219
She's my world!

14:31.413 --> 14:35.452
Okay, imagine that this idiot
were her father.

14:35.834 --> 14:37.153
What the hell would you say to him?

14:37.335 --> 14:39.485
Oh, my God!
There's a tumour the size of a golf ball

14:39.713 --> 14:41.385
right where the knife went in.

14:41.589 --> 14:43.659
If we hadn't found this,
she'd be a goner.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.521
I think that's what I'd say.

14:47.137 --> 14:49.492
- How'd we do?
- Great. Go.

14:55.937 --> 14:57.689
So until Kelso reinstates me here,

14:57.897 --> 15:00.536
my practise has me doing house calls
on all their rich clients.

15:00.775 --> 15:02.413
During the last one,
I'm taking the woman's vitals

15:02.610 --> 15:06.080
and her grandson kept trying to poke
his tiny little finger up my butt.

15:06.364 --> 15:09.481
- Kids, huh?
- He's 41, Carla.

15:09.743 --> 15:11.540
He just has very small hands.

15:11.745 --> 15:13.064
Well, that's not right.

15:13.246 --> 15:14.998
Can you believe Kelso?

15:15.206 --> 15:17.356
Dr Kelso's just angry, Elliot.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.636
I mean, have you ever
considered it from his side?

15:20.879 --> 15:24.110
His hospital trains you for five years,
and you go get a better job.

15:24.382 --> 15:28.261
Which is great!
But, I mean, let me ask you this.

15:29.304 --> 15:31.181
Have you ever once thanked him?

15:34.434 --> 15:38.143
- So how was your date with Heather?
- It was touch-and-go at the end.

15:40.065 --> 15:43.614
- I had a really good time tonight.
- Thanks. Me, too.

15:44.152 --> 15:47.827
<i>But I knew you needed me,
so I went for it, Italian-style.</i>

15:48.865 --> 15:50.742
That's not what you want.

15:52.744 --> 15:55.463
<i>And just when it couldn't get
any better...</i>

15:56.498 --> 15:57.613
J. D?

15:58.541 --> 16:03.057
Oh, my God. Chad Miller,
Danny Murphy, Jim Stegger?

16:03.380 --> 16:06.372
The three football players
who used to beat me up in high school.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.703
Looks like we were
wrong about you, man.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.222
What are you guys up to now?

16:12.430 --> 16:14.227
We're all gay together.

16:15.558 --> 16:18.516
- Do you remember Kristin Fisher?
- Of course!

16:18.770 --> 16:21.045
You turned me down
for homecoming and prom,

16:21.272 --> 16:23.103
even though I didn't ask you
to either one.

16:23.316 --> 16:26.308
Well, I'd love to make it up to you
and have sex with both of you.

16:26.569 --> 16:28.207
If that's all right with you, Heather.

16:28.405 --> 16:30.077
As long as we make it all about J.D.

16:30.281 --> 16:31.509
Sure!

16:32.283 --> 16:33.557
Come on in.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.885
Enough of this, let's go bang.

16:43.294 --> 16:48.004
And that's why Heather
will never look attractive to you again.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.218
- Come on, buddy.
- Where did I lose you?

16:50.427 --> 16:52.497
How did Kristin know Heather's name?

16:52.721 --> 16:55.235
- Damn, you're good!
- Yeah.

16:55.473 --> 16:58.510
We went line dancing,
and I cut her with one of my spurs.

16:58.768 --> 17:00.247
I'm sorry, buddy.

17:00.437 --> 17:02.428
All right, baby, here it is.

17:02.689 --> 17:05.282
Our nanny is very attractive,

17:05.525 --> 17:08.642
but you and I, we're married,
our relationship is rock-solid.

17:09.612 --> 17:11.250
So I think we both know
it's no big deal

17:11.448 --> 17:13.598
if I look at her
every once in a while, right?

17:16.328 --> 17:18.887
Heather, we're gonna
have to let you go.

17:20.248 --> 17:21.476
So sorry.

17:27.213 --> 17:30.011
Dr Kelso, I need to talk to you,
and I know that you won't speak to me,

17:30.258 --> 17:33.011
but that's okay,
because I just need you to listen.

17:33.261 --> 17:37.015
You're a scary, scary man,
and because I've been petrified of you,

17:37.307 --> 17:39.946
I've stayed up every night for five years
studying medical books

17:40.185 --> 17:42.858
which I can pretty much now recite
in my sleep.

17:43.104 --> 17:45.334
I don't have a husband or kids,

17:45.565 --> 17:49.274
<i>and the last movie I went to see was
The Blair Witch Project,</i>

17:49.569 --> 17:52.447
which is the main reason
I've stopped camping.

17:53.156 --> 17:55.909
That and the time a wolf mounted me...

17:57.118 --> 18:01.396
My point is you've helped push me
to become the doctor that I am today.

18:02.540 --> 18:05.179
And for that, I want to thank you.

18:06.628 --> 18:10.416
One more thing. I'm sure that no dog
could ever replace Baxter,

18:11.549 --> 18:14.143
but this little guy needs a home.

18:14.386 --> 18:18.015
If you decide you don't want him,
just bring him back to me.

18:27.065 --> 18:30.216
- That was a coincidence.
- What?

18:30.485 --> 18:32.999
That knife, it just happened
to go into the exact right spot.

18:33.238 --> 18:35.035
You do not get a win for dumb luck.

18:35.240 --> 18:39.438
Look, if that's the way you choose
to see the world, then so be it,

18:39.744 --> 18:42.861
but don't you dare try
to take this away from me.

18:43.123 --> 18:46.081
I've been coming in here
every day for 24 years,

18:46.334 --> 18:49.849
watching children die
and seeing good people suffer,

18:50.130 --> 18:53.440
and if I quit believing that there was
a bigger plan behind all this, well,

18:53.717 --> 18:55.230
I just wouldn't be able
to show up tomorrow.

18:55.427 --> 18:56.940
So just stop it!

18:58.638 --> 19:00.435
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

19:02.976 --> 19:03.965
You'd be surprised

19:04.144 --> 19:07.056
how many bad things
happen around here for a reason.

19:07.313 --> 19:09.588
Well, I wish I could believe that.

19:10.608 --> 19:14.317
It was awful that Jordan
had to have pre-natal surgery,

19:14.612 --> 19:16.728
but how have you two been since then?

19:18.658 --> 19:20.614
I'm really glad I have you.

19:21.578 --> 19:23.091
Better than ever.

19:23.913 --> 19:25.187
Good night.

19:26.416 --> 19:29.089
<i>So maybe sometimes bad things
do happen for a reason.</i>

19:29.336 --> 19:31.247
<i>Like your hot nanny getting fired.</i>

19:31.463 --> 19:33.055
Turk, look at this!

19:37.260 --> 19:38.375
<i>You know, for a half-breed baby,</i>

19:38.553 --> 19:40.987
<i>your parents have
some pretty nice stuff.</i>

19:43.767 --> 19:45.439
She was a racist thief.

19:45.643 --> 19:47.918
A smoking-hot racist thief.

19:49.898 --> 19:51.251
You look pretty.

19:51.441 --> 19:54.160
<i>Or how getting suspended
can get a relationship back on track.</i>

19:54.402 --> 19:55.630
Dr Reid!

19:57.572 --> 19:59.642
Consider your suspension over.

20:00.825 --> 20:04.295
That said, you're still
a ridiculous excuse for a doctor.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.052
He talked to me.

20:11.461 --> 20:14.692
<i>Or how facing a tough situation
can bring you closer together.</i>

20:14.964 --> 20:17.603
- How's that baby?
- She's hanging in there.

20:22.806 --> 20:24.842
<i>Be careful, though,
because around here,</i>

20:25.058 --> 20:27.367
<i>if you start believing that
bad things happen for a reason,</i>

20:27.602 --> 20:30.116
<i>it hurts that much more
when they don't.</i>

20:30.355 --> 20:32.471
What's with all the sad faces?

20:32.899 --> 20:35.891
Laverne was in a car accident
on her way to work.

20:37.112 --> 20:39.467
She's in a coma and unresponsive.
