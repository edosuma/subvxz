00:02.536 --> 00:04.105
Hi, I'm Jeffrey Tanner.

00:04.138 --> 00:05.506
Welcome to Sophe.

00:05.539 --> 00:08.076
We all know the Internet
changed the world.

00:08.109 --> 00:10.244
The only question is:
into what?

00:10.278 --> 00:11.612
It can be a platform
to bring us together

00:11.645 --> 00:13.347
or to tear us apart.

00:13.381 --> 00:14.548
I know, because I spent my life

00:14.582 --> 00:16.484
trying to turn it
into something

00:16.517 --> 00:18.586
that would connect us all.
Then...

00:18.619 --> 00:20.588
I love you, Dad.
...my daughter was murdered.

00:20.621 --> 00:22.523
Nothing else mattered anymore.

00:22.556 --> 00:24.558
Everyone was sure
they knew who did it--

00:24.592 --> 00:26.427
the police, my ex-wife--

00:26.460 --> 00:28.229
but I was convinced the wrong
man had been convicted

00:28.262 --> 00:30.264
and the real killer
was still out there.

00:30.298 --> 00:32.233
So together with my team,
I built Sophe,

00:32.266 --> 00:34.568
a crowdsource
crime solving platform

00:34.602 --> 00:37.438
powered by the smartest,
most diverse,

00:37.471 --> 00:40.541
independent collection of
detectives on the planet:

00:40.574 --> 00:43.144
you.

00:43.177 --> 00:44.078
Let's get to work.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.282
Previously on
Wisdom of the Crowd...

00:48.316 --> 00:50.418
TANNER: I have evidence
that leads me to believe

00:50.451 --> 00:53.087
the cops have
incarcerated the wrong man.

00:53.121 --> 00:55.156
This is not the
kind of distraction
that we need right now.

00:55.189 --> 00:56.457
The more they start loving this,
the more they're gonna

00:56.490 --> 00:57.658
start to believe
that Jeffrey's actually right

00:58.726 --> 00:59.560
and Mia's killer
is still out there.

01:00.794 --> 01:01.495
You've been divorced nine years,
you don't owe him anything.

01:02.230 --> 01:02.663
TANNER:
How can you be so sure

01:03.131 --> 01:03.864
that Carlos Ochoa

01:03.897 --> 01:05.433
wasn't the secret boyfriend?

01:05.466 --> 01:07.668
LORI:
Because Carlos wasn't a secret.

01:07.701 --> 01:09.437
We've got something.
About Mia?

01:09.470 --> 01:11.239
SARA:
No, something new.

01:11.272 --> 01:15.109
"Has anyone seen
Antoine Reddick?"

01:15.143 --> 01:16.477
Is that blood?!

01:16.510 --> 01:18.246
We don't know anything
for sure yet.

01:18.279 --> 01:20.148
Can you please help us?

01:20.181 --> 01:21.649
People are responding.
He's alive.

01:21.682 --> 01:23.584
We need paramedics,
but he's alive.

01:23.617 --> 01:25.686
(all cheering, whooping)

01:25.719 --> 01:27.121
TANNER:
Someone sent this photo.

01:27.155 --> 01:28.322
Your daughter
with some guy

01:28.356 --> 01:29.523
who could be anybody.
Or he could be the one

01:30.591 --> 01:31.625
walking out of her place
the night she was murdered.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.228
I checked all the arrests
from Berkeley that night.

01:34.262 --> 01:35.563
TANNER:
Ryan Booth...

01:35.596 --> 01:37.531
Same shirt as in the picture.

01:37.565 --> 01:39.433
Tattoos match, too.

01:39.467 --> 01:40.634
Can I put this on Sophe?

01:40.668 --> 01:42.236
Well, that's up to you.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.108
(air blowing)

01:58.486 --> 02:00.621
Dude, you have got to
be the most expensive

02:00.654 --> 02:02.623
data entry clerk in the Valley.

02:02.656 --> 02:04.925
It's not data entry,
it's data translation.

02:04.958 --> 02:08.362
From what, hard copy to .txt?

02:08.396 --> 02:10.231
These are old crime stats
from the state archives.

02:10.264 --> 02:11.932
See-- don't touch that--
every police department

02:11.965 --> 02:13.601
reports crime data
in a different format.

02:13.634 --> 02:14.702
Please stop.

02:14.735 --> 02:17.705
So we've got to convert
all of it to a uniform schema.

02:17.738 --> 02:20.441
Luckily, it's something
crowds are good at.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.643
In fact, right now,
I've got 2,187 users

02:22.676 --> 02:24.512
helping with data
verification...
I take it back.

02:24.545 --> 02:26.447
...and conversion.
You're not just a clerk.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.682
You are the king
of all data entry.

02:28.716 --> 02:31.552
What do we need with these
old police reports, anyway?

02:31.585 --> 02:34.522
We are bootstrapping
Sophe's machine learning.

02:34.555 --> 02:37.691
By having her input crime data,
her pattern-matching algorithms

02:37.725 --> 02:39.693
can analyze old cases,
see if there's any links

02:39.727 --> 02:42.363
between Mia's murder
and past crimes.

02:42.396 --> 02:45.666
Then we feed those links back
into the crowd for verification.

02:45.699 --> 02:48.302
It's like a perfect, symbio...
(computer beeping)

02:48.336 --> 02:50.271
(Josh typing)

02:52.440 --> 02:55.309
TARIQ: What?
JOSH: It's saying these
three cases are connected.

02:55.343 --> 02:57.411
But they don't have
anything to do with Mia.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.682
Where's Tanner?

03:01.715 --> 03:04.785
He's dealing with something.

03:07.388 --> 03:09.790
TANNER:
Ryan Booth.

03:09.823 --> 03:14.262
Did Mia ever mention
anything about him to you?

03:14.295 --> 03:17.331
No, not that
I can remember. Why...?

03:17.365 --> 03:19.567
TANNER:
Mia's friend Lori Meyers

03:19.600 --> 03:22.403
said that Mia
had a secret boyfriend.

03:22.436 --> 03:24.372
Someone that she was scared of.

03:24.405 --> 03:26.840
That no one knew about.
Mm-hmm.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.809
I've gone through
all the conversations

03:28.842 --> 03:31.512
that I've had with Mia
a thousand times.

03:31.545 --> 03:35.015
If she had said something to me
about a person like this,

03:35.048 --> 03:37.017
I would've told the police.
I don't r-- I don't know

03:37.050 --> 03:39.320
who this guy is.
Okay, what about "sports shop"?

03:39.353 --> 03:41.655
"Sports" what? I don't...

03:41.689 --> 03:44.558
Lori overheard Mia
say that to him.

03:44.592 --> 03:47.795
It could be a-a nickname,
a place he worked.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.597
Okay, Jeffrey.

03:49.630 --> 03:50.831
(sniffles)
You need to stop this.

03:50.864 --> 03:53.501
Please.

03:53.534 --> 03:57.371
Listen to me, for as long
as we've been divorced,

03:57.405 --> 03:59.239
I've always cared about you.

04:00.408 --> 04:01.642
But you're spiraling right now.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.844
I'm spiraling?
You're s... The police

04:03.877 --> 04:05.846
have caught
our daughter's murderer.

04:05.879 --> 04:07.748
Carlos Ochoa?
Yeah.

04:07.781 --> 04:09.750
No. No.

04:09.783 --> 04:12.486
I looked him in the eye
in that prison,

04:12.520 --> 04:16.324
and that is not
how he felt about Mia.

04:16.357 --> 04:19.860
You went to visit
Carlos Ochoa in prison?

04:19.893 --> 04:21.862
Because I needed
to know the truth.

04:21.895 --> 04:25.633
There isn't a part of you
that doesn't wonder?

04:25.666 --> 04:27.368
Of course there is.

04:27.401 --> 04:29.770
I miss her
every single day.

04:29.803 --> 04:31.639
And if I thought any of this
were true,

04:31.672 --> 04:33.874
I would... I would
stand next to you,

04:33.907 --> 04:36.510
and I would tell the police
they're wrong.

04:36.544 --> 04:37.911
But they're not.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.913
We looked at
the crime scene photos.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.515
Yeah.

04:41.549 --> 04:42.916
Okay, we sat through the trial.

04:42.950 --> 04:47.388
And we had to ID our
daughter's body together.

04:47.421 --> 04:52.426
Jeffrey, I can't keep
reliving this anymore.

04:52.460 --> 04:56.664
I am begging you
to stop chasing ghosts.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.799
This isn't a ghost.

04:58.832 --> 05:02.770
This is a drug addict with
a violent criminal record,

05:02.803 --> 05:04.805
caught on camera
assaulting our daughter.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.707
Honey...

05:06.740 --> 05:09.710
And I am gonna find him.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.417
CAVANAUGH:
Yeah, that's right. "Booth."

05:16.450 --> 05:18.852
B-O-O-T-H.

05:20.454 --> 05:21.955
No, I'm looking
for whatever you have.

05:21.989 --> 05:24.425
He's a person of interest
in a case down here.

05:24.458 --> 05:26.560
So I was hoping that...

05:26.594 --> 05:28.629
Yeah. Yeah, of course I'll hold.

05:28.662 --> 05:31.532
Again.

05:31.565 --> 05:32.933
Working a case?

05:32.966 --> 05:35.903
You're a cop.
What does the evidence say?

05:35.936 --> 05:38.739
For us? Or are you moonlighting
for Jeffrey Tanner again?

05:40.708 --> 05:42.476
H-Hello?

05:42.510 --> 05:44.845
Th-- nothing?

05:44.878 --> 05:45.946
Really?

05:45.979 --> 05:48.382
(sighs)

05:48.416 --> 05:50.350
Yeah, thank you.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.821
Apparently, neither.

05:53.854 --> 05:56.524
You do know your job
is to take care of the cases

05:56.557 --> 05:57.891
on your desk, right?

06:00.428 --> 06:03.464
My job, Lieutenant,

06:03.497 --> 06:04.898
is to solve crimes.

06:04.932 --> 06:07.535
And in case you forgot,

06:07.568 --> 06:08.769
Tanner's helped us take down

06:08.802 --> 06:10.671
two pretty big ones
in the past week.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.574
Look, Tommy, I'm just trying
to help you out, okay?

06:13.607 --> 06:15.676
If the brass catch on that
you're helping Jeffrey Tanner

06:15.709 --> 06:17.678
undermine a closed
murder case...

06:17.711 --> 06:19.547
Your closed murder case.

06:19.580 --> 06:20.948
Whatever.
(phone beeps)

06:20.981 --> 06:22.516
I'm just saying.

06:24.685 --> 06:26.687
Where are you going?

06:26.720 --> 06:28.956
To do my job.

06:32.993 --> 06:34.862
It's been three days.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.697
We still have nothing
on Ryan Booth?

06:36.730 --> 06:39.667
It takes time. If he's out
there, we'll find him.

06:39.700 --> 06:43.471
In the meantime, you're not
gonna believe what Sophe's done.

06:43.504 --> 06:44.905
What?
Well...

06:44.938 --> 06:46.507
we've been building
out the system

06:46.540 --> 06:47.708
by having Sophe
look at links

06:47.741 --> 06:51.879
between Mia's murder
and past crimes.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.013
And?

06:53.046 --> 06:54.648
Unfortunately,
we didn't find any.

06:54.682 --> 06:56.650
But we did find this.

06:56.684 --> 06:58.519
Ten months ago, a
woman named Mei Chang

06:58.552 --> 06:59.853
was murdered in an alley

06:59.887 --> 07:01.622
down in Hunters Point
in San Francisco.

07:01.655 --> 07:02.890
Two weeks later,
Ramon Ortiz

07:02.923 --> 07:04.792
was found in a field
in San Bruno.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.059
A month after that,
Olivia Medina

07:06.093 --> 07:07.795
was shot and killed
over in Alameda.

07:07.828 --> 07:10.030
The San Bruno and Alameda
victims were both shot.

07:10.063 --> 07:12.232
CBI linked the murders
through ballistics,

07:12.265 --> 07:15.068
but Mei Chang, the Hunters Point
victim, was suffocated.

07:15.102 --> 07:18.572
SFPD ruled it
as a random act of violence.

07:18.606 --> 07:21.008
And I'm guessing that
Sophe says otherwise.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.511
Yeah. Our cluster-weighted
modeling engine inferred

07:23.544 --> 07:25.746
an 81% likelihood that
all three cases are related.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.014
SARA:
And when we put it

07:27.047 --> 07:28.849
to the crowd to eliminate

07:28.882 --> 07:31.652
any coincidental overlaps,
the links only got stronger.

07:33.621 --> 07:35.623
Anyone notify the SFPD?

07:35.656 --> 07:38.058
SARA: I did. Cavanaugh
should be here any minute.

07:38.091 --> 07:41.562
(whirring)

07:41.595 --> 07:42.796
(clicks, whirring stops)

07:42.830 --> 07:44.598
TANNER:
Lemon-ginger-beet.

07:44.632 --> 07:46.567
It'll clear your head.
You want some, Detective?

07:46.600 --> 07:47.835
I'm not a big beet guy,
actually.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.737
All right.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.805
So what now, you guys
are just gonna insert yourself

07:51.839 --> 07:53.874
into any open case you see fit?

07:53.907 --> 07:55.509
I thought you were
looking for Ryan Booth.

07:55.543 --> 07:56.610
We are.

07:56.644 --> 07:58.912
But the Internet can multitask.

07:58.946 --> 08:00.781
Every case that Sophe solves
just makes her smart...

08:00.814 --> 08:02.883
Yeah, smarter, yeah. I know.

08:02.916 --> 08:04.652
So good for Sophe,
but I'm the one

08:04.685 --> 08:06.019
getting the dirty looks at work.

08:06.053 --> 08:08.656
This isn't about me, Detective.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.691
These victims are all
the kinds of people

08:10.724 --> 08:14.294
who slip through the cracks:
low income, minorities.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.896
Justice isn't just supposed

08:15.929 --> 08:17.831
to be for people
like me, is it?

08:17.865 --> 08:19.032
Oh, here we go.

08:19.066 --> 08:21.802
Jeffrey Tanner,
man of the people.

08:21.835 --> 08:22.970
You're a pain in my ass.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.605
I am acutely aware of that.

08:24.638 --> 08:26.607
You got the case notes
on the Mei Chang murder?

08:26.640 --> 08:28.709
Yeah.

08:28.742 --> 08:30.010
Sure, I remember this case.

08:30.043 --> 08:31.612
The investigating detective

08:31.645 --> 08:33.113
thought that was
a carjacking gone bad.

08:33.146 --> 08:35.115
But I remember thinking
there was something more.

08:35.148 --> 08:36.817
Josh, will you do me a favor?

08:36.850 --> 08:39.019
Will you pull up the
woman in, um, Alameda?

08:39.052 --> 08:40.554
(typing)

08:40.588 --> 08:42.155
JOSH:
Okay.

08:42.189 --> 08:44.725
(typing)

08:44.758 --> 08:47.127
There. There, look.

08:47.160 --> 08:48.829
The victim's shoes were missing.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.698
Just like Mei Chang.

08:50.731 --> 08:52.099
What do you mean,
"missing shoes"?

08:52.132 --> 08:54.101
I don't remember that from
the official report, do you?

08:54.134 --> 08:55.836
No, it wasn't in there.
Uh, that could've
been held back

08:55.869 --> 08:57.605
for investigative purposes.

08:57.638 --> 09:01.041
Or possibly, whoever was typing
it up got really lazy.

09:01.074 --> 09:04.645
People wonder why I question
the Carlos Ochoa murder.

09:04.678 --> 09:06.146
Okay. "Missing shoes."

09:06.179 --> 09:07.981
That should close the link
between Mei Chang

09:08.015 --> 09:09.717
and Alameda.

09:10.951 --> 09:12.653
Huh.

09:12.686 --> 09:14.021
I thought it'd be higher.

09:16.824 --> 09:18.959
CAVANAUGH:
All right, what's happening?

09:18.992 --> 09:21.161
Detective,

09:21.194 --> 09:24.364
you don't just have three
interconnected cases here.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.566
You've got, uh...
Fourteen.

09:27.868 --> 09:29.870
CAVANAUGH:
What the hell?

09:29.903 --> 09:31.371
Are you saying
all these cases are connected?

09:31.404 --> 09:33.741
I'm not. Sophe is.

09:33.774 --> 09:37.177
Like some sort of
serial killer.

09:41.849 --> 09:43.116
Post it.

09:43.150 --> 09:45.185
Wha-- whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold up, hold up.

09:45.218 --> 09:47.087
What?
Look, if you're right,

09:47.120 --> 09:49.089
the public might freak.
We got to think about
how we're gonna do this.

09:49.122 --> 09:50.691
Done.
What?

09:50.724 --> 09:52.159
Power to the people, am I right?

09:52.192 --> 09:53.627
Read 'em and weep.

10:02.970 --> 10:04.938
*

10:15.015 --> 10:16.917
What the hell, Tommy?

10:16.950 --> 10:19.152
You let Tanner take this thing
live without vetting it first?

10:19.186 --> 10:21.021
I didn't let Tanner
do anything. Free speech.

10:21.054 --> 10:22.923
If they want to cry
"serial killer,"

10:22.956 --> 10:24.992
there's not a whole lot
I can do to stop them.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.929
14 unrelated DBs?

10:28.962 --> 10:30.898
Yeah.

10:30.931 --> 10:33.366
If this had been serial,
someone would've noticed.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.035
Actually,
I'm not so sure.

10:35.068 --> 10:38.371
I mean, spread over eight
jurisdictions and 11 years.

10:38.405 --> 10:40.373
I mean...

10:40.407 --> 10:43.076
what these cases have in common
are little bits of trace,

10:43.110 --> 10:45.813
minor background details.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.447
Like the shoes,
they must be trophies.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.149
Most cases have them,
but some cases don't.

10:49.182 --> 10:53.020
They're all connected
in tiny, different ways.

10:53.053 --> 10:56.156
Kind of stuff
even good cops would miss.

10:56.189 --> 10:58.892
I know you like to obsess
over your own cases, Tommy.

10:58.926 --> 11:01.829
Now you want to obsess
over everyone else's?

11:01.862 --> 11:03.163
Fine.

11:03.196 --> 11:05.165
Where do we start?

11:07.167 --> 11:08.969
"We"?

11:09.002 --> 11:10.838
Deputy chief's orders.

11:10.871 --> 11:13.040
If I didn't know better,
I'd think she didn't trust you.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.241
CAVANAUGH:
Fine, let's start

11:14.274 --> 11:15.776
with the one
in our jurisdiction.

11:15.809 --> 11:16.944
Mei Chang.

11:16.977 --> 11:18.211
WOMAN:
You wouldn't even be here

11:18.245 --> 11:20.180
if it weren't for
this Web site.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.449
CAVANAUGH: Mrs. Chang,
I assure you that the SFPD

11:22.482 --> 11:25.819
remains committed to finding
your daughter's killer.

11:25.853 --> 11:28.756
I was looking
through Mei's police file

11:28.789 --> 11:31.959
and it seems as though she had
a bit of a troubled past,

11:31.992 --> 11:33.260
a few drug busts.

11:33.293 --> 11:35.162
We did the best
we could, but...

11:35.195 --> 11:37.197
Maybe you see trouble,
but this was our little girl.

11:37.230 --> 11:40.834
Of course.

11:40.868 --> 11:42.936
We think she may have worked

11:42.970 --> 11:46.740
with a man named Ramon Ortiz

11:46.774 --> 11:48.041
at Daly City Produce.

11:48.075 --> 11:51.779
You know, they dated for a bit.

11:51.812 --> 11:54.815
Uh, is he a suspect now?

11:54.848 --> 11:56.917
RUIZ: Ramon Ortiz
is dead, Mr. Chang.

11:56.950 --> 11:58.485
He was one of the victims.

11:58.518 --> 12:01.021
(sighs heavily)

12:01.054 --> 12:03.857
At the funeral,
Ramon pulled me to the side

12:03.891 --> 12:07.027
and he said he-he might have
an idea who killed Mei.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.829
When I never heard
from him again,

12:08.862 --> 12:12.165
I figured he was just talking.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.837
So, what do you think?

12:16.870 --> 12:18.772
Ortiz went looking
for the killer

12:18.806 --> 12:20.540
and that's what
got him shot?

12:20.573 --> 12:22.509
What I think is there's
13 more families out there

12:22.542 --> 12:24.177
just like this one.

12:24.211 --> 12:27.247
And if a low-grade banger
can find this guy, so can we.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.484
TANNER:
Three more unsolved murders.

12:31.518 --> 12:33.120
Yes.
How the hell is that?

12:33.153 --> 12:34.822
User submissions.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.056
The details haven't
been uploaded

12:36.089 --> 12:37.791
to the statewide
database yet.

12:37.825 --> 12:39.259
Serial killer is sexy,

12:39.292 --> 12:41.194
so there is a flood
of new registration.

12:41.228 --> 12:43.063
That's bumping up our
user base, big time.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.264
TANNER: These have almost
nothing in common

12:44.297 --> 12:45.265
with the first three murders.

12:45.298 --> 12:47.234
Except the killer.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.969
Uh, that's the thing
with probabilistic graphing.

12:49.002 --> 12:50.838
We're actually more certain

12:50.871 --> 12:52.940
of their interconnectedness
because of the commonalities

12:52.973 --> 12:54.274
with the intermediate nodes.

12:54.307 --> 12:55.943
Even I don't
understand that.

12:55.976 --> 12:57.310
JOSH: Basically...
The more cases come in,

12:57.344 --> 12:59.346
the stronger the links get.
Yeah.

12:59.379 --> 13:01.314
Here's one the users found.
There were synthetic

13:01.348 --> 13:02.816
green fibers on
half the victims

13:02.850 --> 13:04.051
and what appears
to be latex burns

13:05.185 --> 13:06.286
on several more.
SARA: The challenge
at the moment

13:07.387 --> 13:08.856
is trying to keep up
with the rate of submissions.

13:08.889 --> 13:10.190
What is it about
serial killers

13:10.223 --> 13:12.592
that makes everyone want
to play along at home?

13:12.625 --> 13:15.062
Stay on it.

13:15.095 --> 13:17.564
Anything breaks,
let me know.

13:17.597 --> 13:19.099
I will.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.901
Hear the news?

13:20.934 --> 13:22.569
I did not.

13:22.602 --> 13:24.938
Hmm.

13:24.972 --> 13:29.309
AllSourcer just named Nell
DeGraf as their new CEO.

13:29.342 --> 13:30.844
Nell DeGraf?

13:30.878 --> 13:32.279
She's a quant.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.314
She's not a visionary.

13:34.347 --> 13:38.118
She is asking
for a sit-down.

13:38.151 --> 13:41.121
She would like
to pick your brain.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.256
She's been handed the keys
to a car she can't drive.

13:43.290 --> 13:45.859
A parley with me
isn't gonna fix it.

13:45.893 --> 13:47.060
You left AllSourcer

13:47.094 --> 13:49.329
under less than
ideal circumstances.

13:49.362 --> 13:52.332
All right? The last thing we
need right now is a fight.

13:52.365 --> 13:54.134
With their user base and
their market share--

13:54.167 --> 13:56.003
thank you--
if they decided

13:56.036 --> 13:58.605
to actually drive traffic
away from our site,

13:58.638 --> 14:00.140
we're looking at a...
All right,
all right, whatever.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.942
I'll sit down.

14:01.975 --> 14:05.245
(sighs)

14:05.278 --> 14:09.082
And you'll, you'll-you'll
promise to be pleasant?

14:09.116 --> 14:11.284
Am I ever unpleasant, Mike?

14:11.318 --> 14:14.154
Don't speak.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.395
*

14:45.252 --> 14:47.955
GUARD: Keep it moving,
keep it moving.

14:59.366 --> 15:01.101
This is for that
white girl.

15:04.337 --> 15:07.007
Hey, Carlos, relax.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.475
Relax. Calm down, man.

15:08.508 --> 15:11.078
Listen, you want protection
in here, homie,

15:11.111 --> 15:12.445
you stick with your
own kind, all right?

15:12.479 --> 15:13.646
You just stay at my car,

15:13.680 --> 15:15.448
nothing's gonna
happen to you.

15:15.482 --> 15:16.683
I'll take care
of you, man.

15:16.716 --> 15:17.684
Let's go.

15:22.055 --> 15:23.423
Sara.

15:23.456 --> 15:24.691
Hmm?

15:24.724 --> 15:26.226
Can I borrow you
for a second?

15:26.259 --> 15:27.694
Sure.

15:32.465 --> 15:34.234
What do you need?

15:34.267 --> 15:37.470
What do we have on
that sports shop clue?

15:37.504 --> 15:41.241
Um, as of this moment,

15:41.274 --> 15:43.977
836 distinct hypotheses.

15:44.011 --> 15:45.445
Give me.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.114
(exhales)

15:47.147 --> 15:48.481
What are you thinking?

15:48.515 --> 15:50.117
Well, that if you can
Where's Waldo?

15:50.150 --> 15:52.019
a serial killer
out of thin air...
Mm.

15:52.052 --> 15:55.455
...you can link one of our
sports shop clues to Ryan Booth.

15:55.488 --> 15:57.424
Let me drive.

16:00.360 --> 16:03.496
Let a professional
take the wheel.

16:03.530 --> 16:06.433
(clears throat)

16:06.466 --> 16:08.001
What?

16:08.035 --> 16:09.269
Nothing, nothing.

16:09.302 --> 16:12.005
I just, I like
the way you code.

16:12.039 --> 16:13.240
SARA:
Right. (clears throat)

16:13.273 --> 16:15.008
TANNER: Yes.
SARA: So...

16:15.042 --> 16:17.277
number one match is
a sporting goods store

16:17.310 --> 16:21.381
called The Sport Stop,
16 miles from Mia's apartment.

16:21.414 --> 16:26.519
Probability of connection
to Ryan Booth is...

16:26.553 --> 16:28.521
(sighs)

16:28.555 --> 16:31.358
...0.015%.
Oh.

16:31.391 --> 16:34.561
The next match
is half that.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.729
This man is a ghost.

16:36.763 --> 16:38.531
Yeah, that seems to be
the consensus.

16:38.565 --> 16:40.367
MIKE: Uh...
(clears throat)

16:40.400 --> 16:43.136
Excuse me, guys. Um, I just
got a call from security.

16:43.170 --> 16:45.238
There's somebody here
you're gonna want to meet.

16:45.272 --> 16:46.339
Who's that?

16:46.373 --> 16:48.375
It's Ryan Booth's brother.

16:48.408 --> 16:50.043
MAN:
You had no right.

16:50.077 --> 16:52.145
You had no right
to plaster Ryan's face

16:52.179 --> 16:54.514
all over your Web site.
All right, Mr. Booth,

16:54.547 --> 16:56.749
I understand that you want to
protect your brother, just...

16:56.783 --> 16:59.186
(chuckles)
Protect him?

16:59.219 --> 17:02.289
My brother sucked up
every resource my family had.

17:02.322 --> 17:04.124
My dad took out
a second mortgage

17:04.157 --> 17:05.758
just to send him to Grand Pines.

17:05.792 --> 17:07.360
Grand Pines?

17:07.394 --> 17:09.262
Some fancy treatment center.

17:09.296 --> 17:11.198
Look, six weeks
after Ryan graduated,

17:11.231 --> 17:13.366
he got nailed
for another DUI.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.068
Where is he now?

17:15.102 --> 17:16.269
I don't know.

17:16.303 --> 17:18.605
We cut contact
after his last relapse.

17:18.638 --> 17:20.173
And you stuck your nose in

17:20.207 --> 17:21.474
and you ripped
that wound right open.

17:21.508 --> 17:23.443
If you have any
humanity at all,

17:23.476 --> 17:27.147
you will take his picture down
and let this go.

17:27.180 --> 17:29.149
I can't do that.

17:29.182 --> 17:31.618
That figures.

17:31.651 --> 17:33.353
The shrink told Ryan

17:33.386 --> 17:36.356
he had narcissistic
personality disorder.

17:36.389 --> 17:40.093
Said his brain was so consumed
with the next fix

17:40.127 --> 17:45.132
that anybody standing in his way
was just collateral damage.

17:45.165 --> 17:47.367
That sound like
anyone you know?

17:49.402 --> 17:51.371
(quietly):
All right.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.373
All right, thank
you. Come on.

18:01.414 --> 18:04.584
I take it
he isn't going to help.

18:04.617 --> 18:07.854
Oh, no, he-he wants me
to die in a fire.

18:07.887 --> 18:09.589
But, on the bright side,

18:09.622 --> 18:14.561
he mentioned that his brother
was a patient

18:14.594 --> 18:16.496
at a place called Grand Pines.

18:16.529 --> 18:19.399
Okay. Well, that's
another potential link.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.234
It's actually
better than that.

18:21.268 --> 18:23.903
Mia's program at Berkeley was
affiliated with that hospital

18:23.936 --> 18:27.240
and that's how they met.

18:27.274 --> 18:29.142
It all makes sense.

18:29.176 --> 18:31.544
JOSH: ...because
it wasn't a murder.

18:31.578 --> 18:34.414
It should be easy for you.
You're a wizard, Harry.
Okay, that's really cute.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.449
I'm gonna call Cavanaugh
and let him know.
Go ahead,
call Cavanaugh.

18:36.483 --> 18:38.618
Let him know what?
Uh...

18:38.651 --> 18:40.653
we have another victim.

18:40.687 --> 18:43.256
But this one's alive.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.397
I was training for a marathon.

18:50.430 --> 18:53.400
Uh, you know, bad
breakups and whatever.

18:53.433 --> 18:54.801
Um, it was pretty late.

18:54.834 --> 18:57.204
I was working long
hours back then.

18:57.237 --> 18:59.672
I had just finished
my run and, uh,

18:59.706 --> 19:02.209
I ducked in to get
a bottle of water.

19:04.577 --> 19:05.845
There was a...

19:05.878 --> 19:07.914
there used to be

19:07.947 --> 19:11.684
a convenience store
there on the corner.

19:11.718 --> 19:14.487
But they've torn this
whole block down.

19:14.521 --> 19:16.756
So, you come out and you head...

19:16.789 --> 19:20.260
Uh, back towards my house.

19:20.293 --> 19:23.963
And then the next thing I know,
there's a, uh...

19:23.996 --> 19:28.668
there's a-a plastic bag
over my head.

19:28.701 --> 19:32.205
And, um, he's trying
to get me down on the ground.

19:33.706 --> 19:36.576
Take your time.

19:36.609 --> 19:38.811
It... it was the gloves.

19:38.845 --> 19:41.748
When I read on Sophe
that some of the victims

19:41.781 --> 19:44.551
had friction burns
from the latex,

19:44.584 --> 19:47.287
that's when I knew
it was the same guy.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.589
Did you see his face?

19:49.622 --> 19:51.624
It was dark.

19:51.658 --> 19:54.961
But I remember that
he smelled like strawberries.

19:54.994 --> 19:57.764
Not the real kind,

19:57.797 --> 19:58.865
the, um...

19:58.898 --> 20:01.701
sickly sweet medicine kind,

20:01.734 --> 20:04.871
like the... the artificial kind.

20:04.904 --> 20:07.274
Um...

20:07.307 --> 20:10.643
and then I fought him off.
(takes deep breath)

20:10.677 --> 20:11.744
I don't know how.

20:11.778 --> 20:14.013
I kicked, I fought, I...

20:14.046 --> 20:16.916
I just ran.

20:16.949 --> 20:19.952
As tired as my legs were,
I ran all the way home.

20:21.821 --> 20:24.824
But, you know,
I haven't run since.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.995
Every day
I just stare at those shoes,

20:29.028 --> 20:30.963
and...

20:30.997 --> 20:33.533
I can't.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.868
We're gonna get this guy,
Ms. Vincent.

20:35.902 --> 20:38.237
I promise you that.

20:40.773 --> 20:42.675
Mr. Tanner,
I've already told you
Yes?

20:42.709 --> 20:44.577
that due to the...
HIPPA regulation,
I know, you already...

20:44.611 --> 20:45.845
Yes. I cannot
divulge information

20:45.878 --> 20:47.647
regarding any patient
who may or may not have

20:47.680 --> 20:48.981
been treated
at this facility.
Will you listen?

20:49.015 --> 20:50.717
We, uh, we...
The door's right here, sir.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.885
...we both... we both know...
Not here, not now.

20:52.919 --> 20:55.722
...that Ryan Booth was
a patient here at this facility.

20:55.755 --> 20:58.291
Okay, I understand

20:58.325 --> 21:00.026
that you have these laws
to protect people,

21:00.059 --> 21:01.794
and I get it
and I respect that.

21:04.063 --> 21:06.299
My daughter was...
was 22 years old,

21:06.333 --> 21:10.670
and she could have done whatever
she wanted with her life.

21:10.703 --> 21:14.741
And she chose to devote herself
to helping others.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.909
And she volunteered here.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.945
That has to account
for something.

21:18.978 --> 21:21.948
Mr. Tanner, I am sorry
for your loss.

21:21.981 --> 21:24.784
I truly am.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.686
But I'm afraid there
is nothing I can do,

21:26.719 --> 21:29.055
and you must go.

21:29.088 --> 21:31.290
Have a good day, sir.

21:32.825 --> 21:35.061
Mr. Tanner.
I'm a huge fan.

21:35.094 --> 21:38.698
I actually met my partner
in a AllSourcer chat group--

21:38.731 --> 21:40.800
"Quidditch Quorum."

21:40.833 --> 21:43.603
Are you still looking
for Ryan Booth?

21:43.636 --> 21:44.904
Did you know him?

21:44.937 --> 21:48.641
Oh, no, he was way
before my time.

21:48.675 --> 21:50.076
But when I saw on Sophe
you were looking for him,

21:50.109 --> 21:52.345
it reminded me
of something.

21:52.379 --> 21:55.615
I found it cleaning
out the art room.

21:55.648 --> 21:58.818
One of the other nurses said
that Ryan Booth made it.

21:58.851 --> 22:01.654
I guess he made one
for everybody.

22:01.688 --> 22:02.989
I was gonna write in,

22:03.022 --> 22:05.324
but I didn't want
to get in trouble.

22:06.125 --> 22:08.094
Did I help?

22:10.963 --> 22:13.966
More than you know.
Thank you.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.035
Yeah.

22:42.795 --> 22:44.363
(camera shutter clicks)

23:03.215 --> 23:05.418
(no audio)

23:10.056 --> 23:11.824
Zwart Schaap.

23:11.858 --> 23:14.393
(no audio)

23:16.929 --> 23:18.431
MAN'S VOICE:
Zwart Schaap.

23:23.069 --> 23:25.438
CARLOS:
No, he can't call me back.

23:25.472 --> 23:27.440
I told you,
because I'm in...

23:27.474 --> 23:30.042
Never mind, just tell him
that it's an emergency.

23:32.111 --> 23:33.813
(quietly):
Tell him I might know

23:33.846 --> 23:35.448
who killed Mia Tanner.

23:41.721 --> 23:45.191
What's up? You, uh, get
everything you need, or...

23:45.224 --> 23:48.895
No. Not yet.

23:55.535 --> 23:57.470
This is pointless.

23:57.504 --> 23:59.472
17 murders and
an attempted murder,

23:59.506 --> 24:00.773
and they're all
over the place.

24:00.807 --> 24:01.941
Physical evidence is different

24:01.974 --> 24:03.976
form victim to victim.

24:04.010 --> 24:05.845
I mean, this one had
latex burns but no fiber.

24:05.878 --> 24:07.179
This one has fiber,
no latex.

24:07.213 --> 24:09.949
Cause of death for most of them
is asphyxiation,

24:09.982 --> 24:12.084
except for these three,
they were shot.

24:12.118 --> 24:13.553
Some of the bodies are
left at the scene,

24:13.586 --> 24:15.021
Some are traveled and dumped.

24:15.054 --> 24:16.255
And what does the smell
of strawberries

24:16.288 --> 24:17.790
have to do with any of it?

24:17.824 --> 24:19.058
He's out there.

24:19.091 --> 24:20.126
The sick bastard
that did all this

24:20.159 --> 24:21.894
is still out there.

24:21.928 --> 24:23.162
If it was any other case,
we'd be looking for

24:23.195 --> 24:25.832
geographic similarities.

24:25.865 --> 24:28.034
Look at this map.

24:28.067 --> 24:30.202
Here.

24:30.236 --> 24:32.772
This is the corner where
Miranda Vincent was attacked.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.807
Not only is the convenience
store not there,

24:34.841 --> 24:36.108
but this alley is supposed
to be right next to it.

24:36.142 --> 24:37.810
That's not there, either.

24:37.844 --> 24:39.211
Yeah, I know.
The whole region has changed.

24:39.245 --> 24:40.847
Some of these maps are too old,
but some are too new.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.549
How are we supposed
to find similarities

24:42.582 --> 24:44.283
if we don't know what
the area looked like

24:44.316 --> 24:45.918
when the murders went down?

24:50.990 --> 24:52.992
I have an idea.

24:55.027 --> 24:57.163
Where are you going?

24:57.196 --> 25:00.032
We are going
down the rabbit hole.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.537
(indistinct chatter)

25:06.906 --> 25:08.875
Lieutenant Ruiz.

25:08.908 --> 25:11.143
Glad you finally figured out
that we can help.

25:11.177 --> 25:14.080
Believe me,
this wasn't my idea.

25:14.113 --> 25:17.016
Well, you just leave
the ideas to us.

25:17.049 --> 25:19.018
I think those together
would be great.

25:19.051 --> 25:21.253
Hey, so, um, it
took a little doing,

25:21.287 --> 25:24.156
but between construction permits
and city change orders,

25:24.190 --> 25:26.292
we managed to reconstruct
what the neighborhoods

25:26.325 --> 25:28.628
would have been like
at the exact date

25:28.661 --> 25:30.630
of each of
the attacks.
You can do that?

25:30.663 --> 25:33.933
I've always wondered, do
police phones have buttons now

25:33.966 --> 25:35.635
or is it still that
old rotary-dial-type...

25:35.668 --> 25:36.769
Ignore him.

25:36.803 --> 25:39.939
As I was saying, we discovered
an interesting trend.

25:39.972 --> 25:41.841
Yes. Each of these
neighborhoods was undergoing

25:41.874 --> 25:44.243
rapid redevelopment at the
time these murders occurred.

25:44.276 --> 25:46.312
Can you see that?

25:46.345 --> 25:49.148
CAVANAUGH: Construction.
TANNER: Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

25:49.181 --> 25:51.083
It's not that
the neighborhoods changed.

25:51.117 --> 25:52.251
It's the construction itself.

25:52.284 --> 25:53.620
Exactly.
Precisely.

25:53.653 --> 25:55.154
At the time of
each of the murders,

25:55.187 --> 25:56.889
there was
an active construction site

25:56.923 --> 25:58.324
within three blocks
of where the body was found.

25:58.357 --> 26:00.927
That might explain
the trace minerals we found

26:00.960 --> 26:02.194
on some of the bodies.

26:02.228 --> 26:03.630
We're looking for someone
who worked

26:03.663 --> 26:04.997
at every one of these sites.
Mm-hmm.

26:05.031 --> 26:08.134
Find him, and you'll
find your killer.

26:13.673 --> 26:16.676
I'll have the grass-fed wagyu,
very rare, and no potatoes.
Mm-hmm.

26:16.709 --> 26:18.210
Thank you.

26:18.244 --> 26:20.813
So, Jeffrey,
I'll get right to the point.

26:20.847 --> 26:22.081
I think the board was crazy

26:22.114 --> 26:23.883
to let you walk out the door
with Sophe.

26:23.916 --> 26:25.618
We both know
crowdsourcing

26:25.652 --> 26:27.820
is the next evolution
in social networks.

26:27.854 --> 26:29.722
I want AllSourcer in
on the action.

26:29.756 --> 26:31.724
And they said
you weren't a visionary.

26:31.758 --> 26:33.159
(Mike chuckles)
Look at that.
(chuckles)

26:33.192 --> 26:35.094
Right?
I think... I think...
I think, actually,

26:35.127 --> 26:36.963
what Jeffrey means
is that he's looking...
Look, uh...

26:36.996 --> 26:39.065
I-I spent the
better part of a year

26:39.098 --> 26:41.668
trying to get Sophe
away from AllSourcer.

26:41.701 --> 26:43.670
Why would I want to
put her right back in?

26:43.703 --> 26:48.107
Well, I understand you're having
some cash flow issues.

26:48.140 --> 26:50.810
Word gets around.

26:50.843 --> 26:52.812
You know, we're willing to make
a substantial investment

26:52.845 --> 26:55.748
that will enable you
to grow Sophe organically.

26:55.782 --> 26:58.785
And all I ask in return
is access to Sophe's

26:58.818 --> 27:00.219
underlying I.P.

27:00.252 --> 27:03.222
The I.P. that I specifically
carved out before I left?

27:03.255 --> 27:06.225
(chuckles) Why... No, I'm sorry,
why would I want to do that?

27:06.258 --> 27:08.127
Or I could just wait for you
to fail and then pick up

27:08.160 --> 27:10.029
the pieces.
Ah, see, I thought

27:10.062 --> 27:12.031
this was gonna be
a hostile takeover.

27:12.064 --> 27:13.199
I was completely wrong.

27:13.232 --> 27:15.434
It's a passive-aggressive one.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.069
MIKE: Look, maybe
there's a way

27:17.103 --> 27:19.906
that we can arrange a mutually
beneficial partnership.

27:19.939 --> 27:21.974
Look, the-the problem
with any partnership

27:22.008 --> 27:23.142
is there are strings attached.

27:23.175 --> 27:24.777
The only way, moving forward,

27:24.811 --> 27:27.146
to make AllSourcer whole
is to monetize Sophe.

27:27.179 --> 27:29.248
So making money
is a problem now?

27:29.281 --> 27:30.983
What Sophe is about

27:31.017 --> 27:32.885
is people wanting to be a part

27:32.919 --> 27:34.854
of something bigger
than themselves.

27:34.887 --> 27:36.255
Yes, I understand that, Jeffrey,

27:36.288 --> 27:37.690
but I don't think
you understand...
(phone chimes)

27:37.724 --> 27:39.158
...what I'm offering here.

27:39.191 --> 27:40.292
I have to take this.

27:40.326 --> 27:43.062
I got to go.
The... You're gonna go?

27:44.230 --> 27:46.699
Jeffrey, where...
What do you think...

27:46.733 --> 27:48.067
Jeffrey.

27:49.936 --> 27:51.938
*

28:23.903 --> 28:26.005
So, we combed
through the official records,

28:26.038 --> 28:28.174
but we couldn't find any
one worker who was ever

28:28.207 --> 28:29.976
at more than a few
of the locations.

28:30.009 --> 28:32.779
But you've got subcontractors
and off-the-book workers.

28:32.812 --> 28:34.781
Exactly. That's where
our users come in.

28:34.814 --> 28:37.083
Yeah, we've got photographs
and all kinds of documentation

28:37.116 --> 28:38.985
coming in on all
17 construction sites.

28:39.018 --> 28:40.887
Uh, what's with
all the flashing?

28:40.920 --> 28:42.221
User input.

28:42.254 --> 28:44.223
People are highlighting regions
for analysis.

28:44.256 --> 28:46.225
SARA: They're trying to find
common elements in the photos.

28:46.258 --> 28:48.227
So, one user selects an item,
and then the others

28:48.260 --> 28:50.296
weigh in on whether
it seems relevant or not.

28:50.329 --> 28:52.031
Wouldn't a computer be faster?

28:52.064 --> 28:54.834
Mm. Visual comprehension is
actually one of those things

28:54.867 --> 28:56.969
that's better done by
humans than by microchips.

28:57.003 --> 28:59.906
It's not elegant, but
intuition plays a big part.

28:59.939 --> 29:04.010
(beeps)
And we have a match.

29:04.043 --> 29:07.780
"Ever-Fresh
Sanitation Services."

29:07.814 --> 29:09.782
How's portable outhouses
for a link?

29:09.816 --> 29:12.251
(gasps) That
strawberry smell.

29:12.284 --> 29:14.086
Deodorizer.
Yeah.

29:14.120 --> 29:15.988
TARIQ: A company like this,
they probably have

29:16.022 --> 29:17.256
a dozen open construction sites
right now.

29:17.289 --> 29:19.125
CAVANAUGH:
Then we better hurry.

29:19.158 --> 29:21.360
Send the address to my phone.
We'll get it on the way.

29:24.030 --> 29:26.132
Damn it, Jeffrey,

29:26.165 --> 29:28.835
that was her asking nice, okay?

29:28.868 --> 29:33.305
The next offer is going to come
across some lawyer's table.

29:33.339 --> 29:34.941
So just...

29:34.974 --> 29:38.144
Just... call me back.

29:38.177 --> 29:39.912
Where the hell is he?

29:39.946 --> 29:41.080
He's not with you?

29:41.113 --> 29:42.882
No. He pulled
a Houdini on lunch.

29:42.915 --> 29:44.951
He got some text,
then just took off.

29:44.984 --> 29:46.919
Oh, that might have been me.
Yeah, some user in Cleveland

29:46.953 --> 29:49.021
tracked down that wire sculpture
Tanner posted on Sophe.

29:49.055 --> 29:51.290
Said he bought one online
a couple months ago.

29:51.323 --> 29:52.959
Return address was up in

29:52.992 --> 29:54.226
Guerneville
somewhere.

29:54.260 --> 29:55.828
Guerneville?

29:55.862 --> 29:57.329
(engine revs)

30:27.359 --> 30:29.361
*

30:55.454 --> 30:57.990
RYAN: I didn't kill
your daughter.

30:58.024 --> 30:59.959
I knew you were
looking for me.

30:59.992 --> 31:01.327
I'm not a total hermit.

31:01.360 --> 31:04.163
But I'm not the guy.

31:04.196 --> 31:06.933
Not the guy
that killed my daughter?

31:06.966 --> 31:08.367
Put the axe down.

31:08.400 --> 31:10.336
Put it down.

31:17.143 --> 31:20.012
I'm not the guy.

31:20.046 --> 31:22.248
The night Mia died,
I was on day three

31:22.281 --> 31:24.316
of a two-week
intensive care stay.

31:24.350 --> 31:27.219
I got a stack of bills
inside I could show you.

31:27.253 --> 31:28.687
They're still trying
to collect on them.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.122
Then why?

31:30.156 --> 31:31.457
Why what?

31:31.490 --> 31:34.426
Why were you grabbing
her arm in the photo?

31:43.035 --> 31:45.037
Why don't you have a seat?

31:54.180 --> 31:56.182
Here you go.

32:02.188 --> 32:04.923
I was crazy about her.

32:06.993 --> 32:10.062
Completely unrequited,
might I add.

32:10.096 --> 32:11.430
Hell, anyone who met her was.

32:11.463 --> 32:13.499
There was a party

32:13.532 --> 32:15.134
the night of the protest.

32:15.167 --> 32:17.403
I knew she'd be there,
so I showed up.

32:17.436 --> 32:21.440
I was messed up by
the time I found her.

32:21.473 --> 32:25.344
Drunk, high, whatever else
you can think of.

32:25.377 --> 32:27.413
(laughs softly)

32:27.446 --> 32:30.049
Uh, she read me the Riot Act.

32:30.082 --> 32:34.486
Wanted me to call my sponsor,
you know, go to a meeting.

32:36.488 --> 32:38.290
Even as mad
as she was,

32:38.324 --> 32:41.327
she always wanted to
do the right thing.

32:43.429 --> 32:46.298
I grabbed her.

32:46.332 --> 32:48.500
I'm not proud of that.

32:50.602 --> 32:53.372
I was just trying to convince
her to come home with me.

32:54.373 --> 32:56.608
She didn't.
(chuckles)

32:56.642 --> 32:59.111
You'd be proud.

33:00.279 --> 33:02.381
Man.

33:02.414 --> 33:04.616
It's a hell of a thing,
pissing off the nicest person

33:04.650 --> 33:08.254
you ever knew.

33:08.287 --> 33:12.058
She wouldn't even let me
visit her at work.

33:12.091 --> 33:14.293
She said that, uh,

33:14.326 --> 33:15.494
she thought it
might be distracting

33:15.527 --> 33:17.096
if everyone knew that...

33:17.129 --> 33:20.066
she was
Jeffrey Tanner's daughter.

33:20.099 --> 33:22.468
(chuckles)
Yeah.

33:22.501 --> 33:25.104
Did you see much of her,
at Grand Pines?

33:25.137 --> 33:27.506
What she was like with
the doctors and the patients?

33:27.539 --> 33:29.108
'Cause I know
that interning

33:29.141 --> 33:31.577
is like 90% coffee
and paperwork,

33:31.610 --> 33:34.280
but she must have left
an impression.

33:35.447 --> 33:37.449
Oh.

33:37.483 --> 33:40.319
Um...

33:40.352 --> 33:42.054
Mr. Tanner.

33:43.289 --> 33:46.425
Mia wasn't an intern
at Grand Pines.

33:47.626 --> 33:49.328
She was a patient.

33:51.863 --> 33:55.134
She was... She was a what?

33:55.167 --> 33:56.502
Checked in the same day as me.

33:58.204 --> 33:59.638
She said, you know,
he was depressed

33:59.671 --> 34:01.540
and needed to get
her head straight.

34:01.573 --> 34:04.510
You know, otherwise,
she'd do something she'd regret.

34:22.294 --> 34:24.163
Well...

34:24.196 --> 34:27.499
if he has any more dead bodies,
we sure won't smell them.

34:31.237 --> 34:33.239
(creaking)

34:39.145 --> 34:41.147
Well, hello.

34:41.180 --> 34:42.781
Don't get many
walk-ins around here.

34:42.814 --> 34:44.383
Byron O'Malley?

34:44.416 --> 34:46.485
You can call me B.J.,
sweetheart.

34:46.518 --> 34:48.720
You, uh, want to rent
some units?

34:48.754 --> 34:50.256
San Francisco Police.

34:50.289 --> 34:51.357
Oh.

34:51.390 --> 34:53.225
Keep your hands
where I can see them.
Oh, no, I...

34:53.259 --> 34:55.827
I'm not much of a threat.

34:55.861 --> 34:58.230
Come on in.

34:58.264 --> 35:00.732
(grunts)

35:02.534 --> 35:03.802
Come on.

35:04.903 --> 35:06.405
You're, uh...

35:06.438 --> 35:09.775
Y'all acting kind of
jumpy, aren't you?

35:09.808 --> 35:11.777
Business records indicate
that you're the sole proprietor.

35:11.810 --> 35:12.911
Is that correct?

35:12.944 --> 35:14.746
Sure.
One of your workers

35:14.780 --> 35:16.848
might know something
about a criminal matter.

35:16.882 --> 35:18.450
Well, you're gonna
have to be more specific.

35:18.484 --> 35:20.919
Um, I've got guys
coming and going all the time.

35:20.952 --> 35:22.254
CAVANAUGH: Uh, someone
who's worked here

35:22.288 --> 35:24.323
for 12 years or more.

35:24.356 --> 35:26.792
Uh, there's only one guy
been there that long.

35:26.825 --> 35:28.260
Don Farrel.

35:28.294 --> 35:29.861
What's Donnie done now?

35:29.895 --> 35:32.431
Well, you tell us where
we can find him, and we'll see.

35:32.464 --> 35:34.433
Well, you're not
gonna have to go far.

35:34.466 --> 35:36.402
He's right here.

35:37.903 --> 35:39.871
RUIZ (whispers):
Tommy.

35:39.905 --> 35:41.373
Where's he going?

35:41.407 --> 35:43.775
CAVANAUGH:
Police!

35:47.579 --> 35:50.549
Give yourself up, Farrel!

36:10.869 --> 36:12.838
(clattering)

36:12.871 --> 36:14.406
Police! Stop!

36:14.440 --> 36:16.608
RUIZ (over radio):
There's a room in the back.

36:16.642 --> 36:18.810
I got him.

36:24.483 --> 36:26.252
(thudding)

36:31.623 --> 36:33.225
San Francisco Police.

36:33.259 --> 36:34.293
Show me your hands.

36:36.528 --> 36:38.897
Show me your hands now!

36:40.499 --> 36:42.268
I'd do what he says.

36:44.303 --> 36:46.872
Interlace your fingers
behind your head.

36:46.905 --> 36:48.974
Hurry up.

36:49.007 --> 36:50.976
What took you so long?

36:55.481 --> 36:57.449
(handcuffs clicking)

37:06.592 --> 37:10.962
SARA:
He was trying to dispose
of the shoes in a vat of acid.

37:10.996 --> 37:12.964
Machine learning, baby.

37:12.998 --> 37:15.334
How's that
for the power of math?

37:15.367 --> 37:17.569
TARIQ: Uh, not so fast there,
Archimedes.

37:17.603 --> 37:19.305
My photo-matching software
found those toilets.

37:19.338 --> 37:21.473
I broke the case. Q.E.D.,
move, I push the button.

37:21.507 --> 37:23.575
Uh, you wouldn't have
even known where to look
if it weren't for Sophe.

37:23.609 --> 37:25.911
And that's not
the correct use of "Q.E.D."
Boys. Boys.

37:25.944 --> 37:27.579
That is the correct use
of Q.E.D. You don't even
know what it stands for.

37:27.613 --> 37:28.714
Calm down.
What does it stand for?

37:28.747 --> 37:30.015
You're both pretty.

37:32.451 --> 37:34.420
Nice one.

37:36.488 --> 37:39.325
Josh.

37:52.638 --> 37:54.640
REPORTER: This seemingly
innocent warehouse

37:54.673 --> 37:56.575
hid the secrets of a man
police believe

37:56.608 --> 37:58.009
is responsible for 17 deaths

37:58.043 --> 38:01.613
in the Bay Area
over the past 12 years.

38:01.647 --> 38:02.648
(camera clicking, beeping)

38:03.715 --> 38:05.751
ALEX:
Perfect.

38:05.784 --> 38:07.018
I think we have it.
Okay, wonderful.
Thank you.

38:07.052 --> 38:08.654
Thank you.
See you gentlemen soon.

38:08.687 --> 38:11.089
Can I just ask you
to wait outside for a moment?

38:11.122 --> 38:12.624
I just need...

38:15.427 --> 38:17.429
You knew, didn't you?

38:19.531 --> 38:20.666
Knew what?

38:20.699 --> 38:22.734
About Mia's stay at Grand Pines.

38:22.768 --> 38:24.102
Jeffrey...

38:24.135 --> 38:25.437
Of course you did.

38:25.471 --> 38:26.605
You had to pay for it.

38:26.638 --> 38:28.407
What are you talking about?

38:29.441 --> 38:31.510
I found Ryan Booth.

38:31.543 --> 38:32.644
He didn't kill her.

38:32.678 --> 38:35.947
But he and Mia
were patients together

38:35.981 --> 38:37.383
at Grand Pines.
Wait a minute.

38:37.416 --> 38:39.084
Unbeknownst to me...
Okay, hold on a second.

38:39.117 --> 38:40.652
That's what this whole thing
is about, Jeffrey?
So-- yes.

38:40.686 --> 38:42.621
Why didn't you tell me?

38:42.654 --> 38:44.390
I couldn't tell you, Jeffrey.

38:44.423 --> 38:46.725
Mia was an adult at the time;
she was 20 years old.

38:46.758 --> 38:48.994
And she didn't want
anyone to know.

38:49.027 --> 38:51.029
She didn't want
you to know.
I could've helped her.

38:51.062 --> 38:52.764
No, you couldn't have.

38:54.099 --> 38:56.067
Jeffrey.

38:56.101 --> 38:59.771
I'm not even...
I'm not even mad at you.

38:59.805 --> 39:04.042
I'm mad at myself because
I keep getting sucked in.

39:04.075 --> 39:05.076
Just a moment.

39:06.678 --> 39:09.114
It's just...
(sighs)

39:16.054 --> 39:17.523
You're gonna kill me

39:17.556 --> 39:19.591
if you don't
let this go.

39:19.625 --> 39:23.462
And you're gonna end up
killing yourself.

39:28.500 --> 39:30.802
TANNER:
What if we never find him?

39:30.836 --> 39:35.173
What-what if I am
just, really...

39:35.206 --> 39:37.175
chasing ghosts?

39:37.208 --> 39:40.479
Then we'll learn that together.

39:40.512 --> 39:43.482
Okay?

39:43.515 --> 39:45.150
The tech works.

39:45.183 --> 39:47.052
I mean, an hour ago,
we just pulled

39:47.085 --> 39:49.621
a serial killer off the street.

39:51.657 --> 39:53.124
Yeah.

39:53.158 --> 39:55.727
We're gonna find
the truth about Mia.

39:55.761 --> 39:57.796
Okay?

40:00.766 --> 40:03.502
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

40:06.805 --> 40:10.075
We solved AllSourcer's
reboot algorithm

40:10.108 --> 40:12.177
with 12 hours...
Mm-hmm.

40:12.210 --> 40:14.780
...a whiteboard, and,
from what I remember,

40:14.813 --> 40:17.115
was contaminated moo shu pork.
(laughs)

40:17.148 --> 40:18.484
Yeah.

40:18.517 --> 40:21.219
It was disgusting.
It was.

40:21.252 --> 40:22.821
We've got this. Okay?

40:22.854 --> 40:24.790
Yeah.

40:48.647 --> 40:50.816
(metal door clattering, closing)

40:52.217 --> 40:54.219
(water running)

40:58.690 --> 41:00.659
(grunts)

41:00.692 --> 41:02.661
(water stops running)

41:02.694 --> 41:05.564
(exhales)

41:05.597 --> 41:07.666
Man, I thought they was gonna
throw down back there, man.

41:07.699 --> 41:08.834
(scoffs)

41:11.236 --> 41:12.804
I told you.

41:12.838 --> 41:16.141
You stick with us,
you stay protected.

41:17.275 --> 41:20.111
Man, thanks, homie.

41:20.145 --> 41:22.113
(slices)
(Carlos grunts)

41:26.918 --> 41:28.820
You should've just

41:28.854 --> 41:30.822
kept your mouth shut
about that girl.

41:35.260 --> 41:38.129
