01:37.974 --> 01:41.394
<i>In Reykjavik, Iceland today,
Bobby Fischer failed to show up</i>

01:41.519 --> 01:43.855
<i>for his second game
against Boris Spassky.</i>

01:55.450 --> 01:58.787
<i>Unpredictable Bobby Fischer
stayed in bed today</i>

01:58.870 --> 02:00.455
<i>rather than show up
for Game Two</i>

02:00.538 --> 02:03.958
<i>in his world title match with chess
champion Boris Spassky of Russia.</i>

02:04.042 --> 02:05.960
<i>The match between
the world's chess champion</i>

02:06.044 --> 02:09.422
<i>Boris Spassky and Bobby Fischer
took a strange turn</i>

02:09.506 --> 02:12.467
<i>when Fischer failed to show up
at the scheduled time</i>

02:12.550 --> 02:14.469
<i>and forfeited Game Two.</i>

02:14.552 --> 02:17.222
<i>The entire world seems to
be asking the same question.</i>

02:17.764 --> 02:19.891
<i>What will Bobby
Fischer do next?</i>

03:43.683 --> 03:44.893
...half
the witnesses they call

03:44.976 --> 03:46.536
are Communists,
the other half are Jews.

03:46.603 --> 03:48.271
If you're both,
do you testify twice?

03:48.354 --> 03:49.981
Go ahead,
make jokes, Mr. Liberal.

03:50.064 --> 03:52.066
Your entire family
wasn't gassed at the camps.

04:00.825 --> 04:02.327
Mama.

04:03.453 --> 04:05.288
Mama!
Not now, Bobby.

04:06.205 --> 04:07.749
I have to talk to you.

04:09.876 --> 04:12.170
Bobby, it's past
your bedtime. Joan?

04:13.504 --> 04:15.006
There's a car out there.

04:15.173 --> 04:16.716
What car?

04:17.132 --> 04:20.511
You told me to tell you.
A red 1952 Chevy.

04:26.309 --> 04:28.937
Bobby, you remember
what I told you?

04:29.020 --> 04:32.273
There are bad people
out there who want to intimidate us,

04:32.357 --> 04:35.485
because we represent
something very threatening to them,

04:35.568 --> 04:37.487
to the status quo.
You remember what that is?

04:37.570 --> 04:38.613
Revolution?

04:38.696 --> 04:43.076
Yes. And sometimes these bad
people want to know about our work.

04:43.159 --> 04:45.036
So they spy on us.

04:46.162 --> 04:47.538
So if someone comes
up to you on the street

04:47.622 --> 04:49.415
and asks you
questions about me

04:49.499 --> 04:50.899
or Mommy's friends,
what do you say?

04:51.125 --> 04:52.502
I have nothing
to say to you.

04:54.045 --> 04:55.505
That's my big boy.

04:58.716 --> 05:01.511
Ugh. Joan, Joan, Joan,
he's got mustard on his shirt.

05:01.594 --> 05:03.721
He's gotta wear that to school tomorrow.
Would you soak it for me?

05:03.846 --> 05:05.139
Love to.

05:05.223 --> 05:06.391
And put him to bed.

05:07.141 --> 05:08.476
Bedtime for Bonzo.

06:42.987 --> 06:47.116
I'm Carmine Nigro,
and I'm told you are a chess player.

06:48.076 --> 06:50.828
Our church, all colors
and creeds welcome.

07:00.296 --> 07:01.297
Bobby.

07:02.673 --> 07:03.674
Choose.

07:05.927 --> 07:07.762
Let's see
what we got here, eh?

07:08.346 --> 07:11.933
Most young people don't have
the concentration to play at a high level,

07:12.016 --> 07:14.018
so please don't get
your hopes up.

07:14.352 --> 07:17.146
He's beaten
everyone he's ever played.

07:17.355 --> 07:20.942
My hopes are he will give up
on the damned game if someone beats him.

07:22.568 --> 07:24.445
Okay. It's your move.

07:26.531 --> 07:27.824
Do you like baseball,
Bobby?

07:29.033 --> 07:30.952
Eh? Jackie Robinson,
Pee Wee Reese?

07:31.035 --> 07:32.036
Mmm-hmm.

07:33.371 --> 07:35.414
Bobby, have you ever been
to the moon on the subway?

07:35.706 --> 07:37.208
Mmm-hmm.

07:37.959 --> 07:39.519
If I take the pieces away,
he just keeps

07:39.544 --> 07:40.962
playing in his head.
Day and night.

07:41.045 --> 07:43.297
Took him to a shrink,
he said to come here.

07:43.840 --> 07:47.426
Well, his game is good,
not exceptional, though.

07:51.722 --> 07:52.890
Hmm.

08:05.236 --> 08:06.404
Who taught him
to move like this?

08:06.529 --> 08:07.738
He taught himself.

08:12.535 --> 08:14.871
Bobby, shall we call it
a draw?

08:17.832 --> 08:19.417
Hmm?

08:26.674 --> 08:27.842
He hates draws.

08:38.644 --> 08:39.645
Check.

08:47.695 --> 08:48.696
Mate.

09:07.506 --> 09:10.186
I'm officially the 25th best
chess player in New York City.

09:10.259 --> 09:12.261
I can tell you
he has great potential.

09:23.314 --> 09:24.649
Come here. Come here.

09:28.903 --> 09:29.987
Again.

09:30.112 --> 09:32.406
Carmine, it's your move.

09:32.490 --> 09:33.991
I know
it's my move.

09:34.075 --> 09:35.243
Come on.

09:35.368 --> 09:36.535
I'm thinking.

09:41.499 --> 09:43.751
<i>Come on, Carmine.
It's your turn.</i>

09:43.834 --> 09:45.169
Bobby, I know
it's my turn.

09:45.503 --> 09:46.671
Just go.

09:51.259 --> 09:52.260
<i>Come on.</i>

09:52.343 --> 09:54.262
<i>Bobby, I still have
time on the clock, okay?</i>

09:54.345 --> 09:55.346
<i>Let me think.</i>

09:55.429 --> 09:56.514
Fine.

10:02.853 --> 10:04.230
Your move, Bobby.

10:08.818 --> 10:09.819
Mate.

10:09.902 --> 10:11.696
<i>There's a rising star
in the chess world,</i>

10:11.779 --> 10:13.447
<i>and he's only 12 years old.</i>

10:14.198 --> 10:15.283
<i>His name is Bobby Fischer.</i>

10:15.825 --> 10:17.785
<i>Today he played
American Master Donald Byrne</i>

10:17.868 --> 10:19.578
<i>and beat him
in what is already</i>

10:19.662 --> 10:21.998
<i>being described as
"The Game of the Century."</i>

10:22.081 --> 10:23.582
So, Bobby,
what's next for you?

10:24.083 --> 10:26.083
It's either I beat them,
or they beat me. You know?

10:27.169 --> 10:29.171
<i>With an impressive string
of five victories,</i>

10:29.255 --> 10:31.299
<i>Bobby today became
the youngest ever</i>

10:31.382 --> 10:32.800
<i>United States Chess Champion.</i>

11:47.583 --> 11:49.085
Mmm.

12:20.157 --> 12:21.325
You're back.

12:22.368 --> 12:24.161
And you won.
Congratulations.

12:26.622 --> 12:28.666
Every night,
I hear you two screw.

12:28.999 --> 12:30.543
Bobby, put those down.

12:30.960 --> 12:32.378
Bobby...
Shut up, Size 12.

12:32.711 --> 12:35.172
You live in my house
and you're not my father, okay?

12:36.173 --> 12:37.758
Bobby.
Where is my father?

12:37.842 --> 12:39.593
Come on.
I was born, right?

12:39.802 --> 12:42.596
What did you do with him?
Is he on Earth?
Does he even exist?

12:42.680 --> 12:45.724
Honey. That was
a long time ago.

12:45.850 --> 12:47.309
So what?
You can't remember?

12:47.393 --> 12:48.769
Where is he?

12:49.645 --> 12:51.021
Gone.
Gone where?

12:51.105 --> 12:52.523
It doesn't matter.

12:52.857 --> 12:54.733
It matters to me.

12:57.278 --> 13:00.698
You know what?
Get the fuck outta here.

13:01.157 --> 13:04.452
You know what?
Go back to Moscow with your Commie friends.

13:04.535 --> 13:09.457
I am studying, day and night.
And I'm gonna be the next world champion.

13:09.540 --> 13:10.749
Do you understand me?

13:10.833 --> 13:15.546
I need silence.
Do you understand?
I want silence.

13:28.392 --> 13:30.728
Mom said you're staying
at the chess club.

13:30.811 --> 13:32.146
It's quiet there.

13:34.899 --> 13:36.734
And what about
high school?

13:36.817 --> 13:38.068
Ha.

13:38.903 --> 13:40.321
She still there?

13:40.404 --> 13:44.825
She fixed up the apartment.
Even got the hot water heater working.

13:47.244 --> 13:49.121
She won't be
living there anymore.

13:49.663 --> 13:53.250
She's going to do politics
in California with Cyril.

13:53.334 --> 13:55.461
You mean King Kong. Mate.

13:55.544 --> 13:57.171
Mom was worried.

13:57.254 --> 14:00.424
She thought if they went away,
you'd go home.

14:00.925 --> 14:02.301
Sleep in a bed.

14:02.927 --> 14:04.595
That's what
she told you? Huh?

14:05.262 --> 14:06.889
And you bought it?

14:06.972 --> 14:09.850
She's running away with some
nutcase Bigfoot Communist.

14:09.934 --> 14:12.269
Oh, oh, and you know what?
"It's for Bobby's benefit."

14:12.353 --> 14:13.979
You said you wanted quiet.

14:15.105 --> 14:16.357
You won, Bobby.

14:16.857 --> 14:18.359
Be happy.

14:24.365 --> 14:26.242
<i>In Portoroz,
Yugoslavia today,</i>

14:26.325 --> 14:28.494
<i>American chess prodigy
Bobby Fischer</i>

14:28.577 --> 14:31.205
<i>became the youngest ever
Grandmaster in the history of the game.</i>

14:31.580 --> 14:34.250
Congratulations, Bobby.
Where do you go from here?

14:34.833 --> 14:37.211
Well, uh, I want to play
the Russians.

14:37.294 --> 14:38.546
They're the best
in the world,

14:38.629 --> 14:39.755
and I'm gonna beat 'em all.

15:03.195 --> 15:05.823
<i>Having won the Interzonal,
he is the odds-on favorite</i>

15:05.906 --> 15:07.199
<i>to win
the Candidates Tournament</i>

15:07.324 --> 15:09.743
<i>and gain a match
against the current world champion.</i>

15:15.499 --> 15:16.584
How are you feeling?

15:16.709 --> 15:17.793
I'm ready.

15:17.876 --> 15:18.877
It's my time.

15:57.958 --> 15:59.838
Mr. Spassky,
a quick chat please?

16:52.304 --> 16:53.639
This is ridiculous.

16:53.931 --> 16:55.933
King to rook three.
Knight to king six.

16:56.100 --> 16:58.143
Pawn takes queen,
bishop to knight seven.

16:58.977 --> 17:00.145
It's over.

17:03.732 --> 17:06.652
The Russians are drawing games
on purpose to save their strength

17:06.734 --> 17:08.612
and they're dumping games
to pad their points,

17:08.695 --> 17:11.323
making it statistically impossible
for me to win.

17:11.448 --> 17:13.909
Mr. Fischer,
your complaint has been lodged.

17:13.992 --> 17:15.035
There's nothing
we can do.

17:15.118 --> 17:16.412
Of course there's
something you can do.

17:16.494 --> 17:18.997
They're playing a team game.
It's five guys against one.

17:19.123 --> 17:20.207
Against me!
Can we go back inside?
Please?

17:20.290 --> 17:21.290
No, I'm not interested...
Bobby, don't...

17:21.375 --> 17:23.127
What the hell are you doing
about this anyways?

17:23.210 --> 17:25.963
All right.
Come here, gather 'round.
I got something to say.

17:26.547 --> 17:28.173
I want to make
this very clear.

17:28.799 --> 17:30.426
The Russians are cheats.

17:30.509 --> 17:32.261
Everybody knows
what's going on.

17:32.344 --> 17:34.722
The corrupt Federation
does nothing to stop it.

17:35.139 --> 17:38.308
And there can be no legitimate
world champ if I'm not playing.

17:38.392 --> 17:39.852
And I'm not gonna play.

17:39.935 --> 17:43.230
Because this is unfair.
It's unjust. It's immoral!

17:43.313 --> 17:44.481
I quit!

17:44.732 --> 17:47.484
I don't just quit this tournament,
I am quitting chess!

17:50.487 --> 17:51.572
Move. Move.

17:51.655 --> 17:52.906
Bobby.

17:53.157 --> 17:56.076
Bobby, wait.
We'll go back inside and apologize.

17:56.160 --> 17:57.327
You can still
place well...

17:57.453 --> 17:59.079
What are you talking about?

17:59.163 --> 18:00.163
This was it!

18:00.205 --> 18:01.248
What do you think
I've been working the past

18:01.331 --> 18:02.416
10 years of my life for?

18:02.499 --> 18:05.335
I was gonna be the youngest world
champ in the history of the game!

18:05.669 --> 18:07.045
That's over now.

18:07.337 --> 18:09.882
They stole it from me,
Carmine, they took it!

18:10.340 --> 18:13.093
That was today! Today!

19:23.747 --> 19:25.624
English.
This is America.

19:28.669 --> 19:32.256
Ah, the American boy who hates
us but cannot resist our magazines.

19:32.756 --> 19:34.800
Spassky is becoming
the new messiah.

19:35.384 --> 19:37.469
They say he won't
ever lose a match.

19:39.346 --> 19:41.098
Someone left this for you.

19:42.015 --> 19:45.185
A lawyer.
You are in trouble, maybe?

20:15.924 --> 20:16.925
Do you want a game?

20:18.552 --> 20:19.553
You think I'm stupid?

20:20.387 --> 20:21.471
So you know who I am.

20:21.555 --> 20:22.764
Yeah. I know who you are.

20:22.848 --> 20:23.891
I've been trying
to reach you.

20:23.974 --> 20:25.767
You don't answer
your phone.

20:26.977 --> 20:28.896
Ah. You're that lawyer.

20:29.730 --> 20:31.064
What did I do?

20:31.148 --> 20:33.233
Nothing.
Nothing. You did nothing.

20:33.317 --> 20:35.152
You do nothing.
That's why I'm here.

20:36.361 --> 20:38.238
I read your article
in <i>Sports Illustrated.</i>

20:38.322 --> 20:39.740
You told the truth
about the Russians.

20:39.823 --> 20:40.866
Yeah, that's right,
I did.

20:40.949 --> 20:42.242
Oh, did you see this?

20:43.785 --> 20:46.663
"Soviet invasion
to hit California surf."

20:47.247 --> 20:49.791
"World's greatest
chess players to visit U.S."

20:49.875 --> 20:52.085
Yeah, I saw that.
They say it's just a game

20:52.169 --> 20:54.546
for fun, hand of friendship,
all that crap.

20:54.630 --> 20:56.506
But you know the truth.
They're laughing at us.

20:57.716 --> 21:00.093
They think their
chess dominance proves

21:00.177 --> 21:04.056
Soviet intellectual
superiority over the decadent West.

21:04.139 --> 21:05.307
I don't really care
about politics.

21:05.390 --> 21:07.434
They're using chess to say...
"Screw America."

21:07.517 --> 21:09.019
Yeah, I'm about the game,
you see.

21:09.186 --> 21:11.063
Two guys at a board,
one makes a move,

21:11.188 --> 21:13.023
the other makes a move,
and that's it.

21:14.441 --> 21:16.485
I'm a chess fan myself.

21:19.488 --> 21:21.657
I'm also
hopelessly patriotic.

21:24.076 --> 21:27.079
I take an interest in people like yourself.
Creative people.

21:28.580 --> 21:31.667
I create the wherewithal
that allows them to do what they do.

21:32.501 --> 21:33.669
Ask Jimi Hendrix.

21:34.336 --> 21:37.130
Ask the Rolling Stones.
If I can help them, I can help anybody.

21:37.923 --> 21:40.092
I'd like to represent you,
Mr. Fischer.

21:41.343 --> 21:43.011
So you're out
to make a buck.

21:43.095 --> 21:45.389
No, I don't need the money.
I'd be doing this for free.

21:45.472 --> 21:46.723
Pro Bono.

21:47.557 --> 21:50.519
You're the one man
in this country who could put up a fight.

21:50.978 --> 21:52.562
Maybe even beat them.

21:52.646 --> 21:54.648
I'd like a front row seat
when the good guys win.

21:56.900 --> 21:58.443
If I went back
to competition,

21:58.527 --> 22:00.028
there'd have to be
some real changes.

22:00.737 --> 22:01.737
It's got to be fair.

22:01.780 --> 22:05.492
If you're serious about playing,
I'll see what I can do.

22:07.452 --> 22:09.079
That is if you
still wanna play.

22:11.707 --> 22:12.708
Call me.

22:30.684 --> 22:32.394
He's very excited
about this.

22:32.728 --> 22:34.062
I'm only a selector
on the committee.

22:34.146 --> 22:37.149
You see, he apologizes
to the Federation.

22:37.232 --> 22:39.234
With profanity
on that first line.

22:40.152 --> 22:41.153
Ah.

22:41.278 --> 22:44.239
Well, he's nursed a grudge for a long time.
Mmm-hmm.

22:44.906 --> 22:47.576
He's studied how
the Russians play.

22:48.076 --> 22:50.037
Every day.
Eighteen hours a day.

22:50.120 --> 22:51.663
For four years.
Mmm-hmm.

22:51.747 --> 22:56.043
For him, Vietnam and the Beatles
never happened.

22:56.585 --> 22:59.421
I'm guessing he still
has his opinions about the Soviets?

22:59.921 --> 23:03.133
Well, you'll promise the committee
we'll keep him out of trouble.

23:03.216 --> 23:06.636
The Piatigorsky was organized to build bridges,
not to burn them.

23:07.804 --> 23:11.016
So we lose 12 to zero,
and that's a bridge?

23:12.934 --> 23:14.269
He asked for you.

23:15.520 --> 23:16.730
Wants you to be his second.

23:19.149 --> 23:20.484
He respects you.

23:20.859 --> 23:22.499
You're the only one
who ever beat Spassky.

23:22.819 --> 23:25.113
We were young.
He'd destroy me now.

23:27.908 --> 23:29.951
And you've beaten Bobby.

23:30.368 --> 23:32.120
That was a long time ago.

23:35.624 --> 23:36.833
Bobby has problems.

23:38.043 --> 23:39.377
So did Mozart.

23:42.839 --> 23:44.007
He might crack.

23:45.967 --> 23:47.969
Bobby won't crack.

23:49.304 --> 23:50.597
He will explode.

23:55.519 --> 23:57.187
Bobby, Bill's here.

23:57.312 --> 23:58.438
Ah.

23:58.522 --> 23:59.815
Hey, Bobby,
how you doing?

23:59.898 --> 24:03.026
Against Petrosian in Zurich,
you sacrificed your king's pawn.

24:03.110 --> 24:04.528
You know that's the thing
that got you, right?

24:04.903 --> 24:06.154
You always play
too cautiously,

24:06.238 --> 24:07.656
and you go crazy
in the other direction.

24:07.739 --> 24:09.282
That's a real weakness.

24:10.033 --> 24:12.160
Hey, if I criticize a priest,
do I go to hell?

24:12.244 --> 24:13.444
Depends if you
believe in hell.

24:14.663 --> 24:16.206
Yeah. All right.

24:16.498 --> 24:19.626
I'm gonna show you how you
could have won in 13 moves.

24:19.709 --> 24:20.710
Huh.

24:21.711 --> 24:23.296
Castle, pawn,

24:24.381 --> 24:26.800
knight, bishop, rook...
That's you.

24:27.259 --> 24:28.260
All right.

24:28.885 --> 24:30.804
King goes there, pawns...

24:32.764 --> 24:34.724
All right. Now here,
here's where you screwed up.

24:35.517 --> 24:38.311
You got greedy,
and you traded knight for bishop

24:38.436 --> 24:40.647
and you sacrificed your pawn, right?
Mmm-hmm.

24:40.730 --> 24:41.731
Now,

24:42.607 --> 24:45.735
what if you'd done
this instead?

24:48.822 --> 24:51.741
You see, the Russians
are like boa constrictors.

24:51.825 --> 24:54.161
If you do nothing,
they strangle you to death.

24:54.244 --> 24:57.372
But if you confuse them,
you attack them from everywhere,

24:58.081 --> 24:59.241
then all they can do
is react.

24:59.916 --> 25:01.877
Now here, you see,
I got my machine gun

25:02.002 --> 25:03.920
lined up,
bearing down on the king.

25:04.004 --> 25:07.757
Now he tries to defend himself.
I sacrifice my rook.

25:08.967 --> 25:10.927
And now
the real attack begins.

25:11.595 --> 25:13.013
Check.

25:13.096 --> 25:15.724
Check. Take.

25:15.807 --> 25:19.060
Hey, Bobby, you know
this tournament's about diplomacy.

25:19.936 --> 25:22.981
No, this tournament,
like all tournaments, is about winning.

25:23.064 --> 25:24.357
So...

25:24.441 --> 25:26.193
Okay, well.
Rook takes bishop.

25:26.276 --> 25:27.277
Of course.

25:27.777 --> 25:31.072
Now, he thinks he's safe,
but I've been developing a plot to kill his king.

25:31.156 --> 25:33.200
You see, my rook
is sitting there waiting,

25:33.283 --> 25:34.534
forgotten about
in the background.

25:34.618 --> 25:36.036
I bring him into the hunt.

25:37.037 --> 25:38.455
Now the king flees.

25:39.331 --> 25:41.958
Even his beloved queen
can't do anything.

25:42.459 --> 25:45.170
She's just sitting there,
watching... Mmm-hmm.

25:45.253 --> 25:46.463
...as the noose tightens.

25:46.546 --> 25:47.547
And finally...

25:49.341 --> 25:50.592
He sees the end.

25:51.635 --> 25:52.802
Holy shit.

25:53.053 --> 25:56.264
Hey, I didn't know a priest
could use bad language.

25:57.557 --> 25:58.683
I like this guy.

25:59.517 --> 26:01.645
So, uh, we going
to California?

26:18.662 --> 26:22.165
<i>This is 93 KHJ Los Angeles.</i>

26:22.707 --> 26:25.043
<i>Don't be fooled
by the warm weather, kids.</i>

26:25.126 --> 26:27.921
<i>Because the Cold War
just blew into town.</i>

26:28.505 --> 26:32.092
<i>The Soviet chess team arrived today in L.A.
for a goodwill tournament.</i>

26:32.342 --> 26:36.179
<i>With them is the current
world champion, Boris Spassky.</i>

26:39.599 --> 26:42.352
<i>The comrades are booked into
the Beverly Hilton Hotel.</i>

26:42.435 --> 26:44.688
<i>So much for
working-class values.</i>

26:45.063 --> 26:46.648
<i>If you're listening, guys,</i>

26:46.731 --> 26:50.026
<i>welcome to the Free World
and enjoy the sunshine.</i>

27:18.221 --> 27:19.556
Four C... What?
Yeah, yeah.

27:19.639 --> 27:22.225
Six A. It's really hot in here.
What's going on?

27:22.309 --> 27:23.351
Repair guy didn't show.

27:23.435 --> 27:26.521
You know, you promised hotels.
This place is a real dive.

27:26.604 --> 27:28.231
Are you a rock star?
He acts like a rock star.

27:28.398 --> 27:30.025
You realize I have
to prepare, right?

27:31.443 --> 27:32.986
Right?
Yeah.

27:33.069 --> 27:34.612
Well, you know what?
What?

27:34.696 --> 27:36.239
I ain't stayin' here.

27:37.032 --> 27:38.033
Bobby.

27:38.616 --> 27:40.285
These are
improved accommodations?

27:40.368 --> 27:41.369
This is improved.

27:41.453 --> 27:42.579
Staying at a roach motel.

27:42.746 --> 27:43.830
Somebody else
is paying for it.

27:43.913 --> 27:45.373
Yeah, well, where are
the Russians staying?

27:45.498 --> 27:46.818
We don't have
their kind of money.

27:46.875 --> 27:48.335
Didn't we invent money?

27:48.835 --> 27:50.378
We rely
on private donors.

27:50.462 --> 27:51.504
Yeah, right.

27:51.588 --> 27:53.256
The Russians,
they get whatever they want

27:53.423 --> 27:55.133
because they know
what it takes to win.

27:55.508 --> 28:00.555
And I end up staying next to Route 66.
All I want is some quiet!

28:01.222 --> 28:02.432
So stop yelling.

28:06.102 --> 28:08.897
Yeah, yeah. Right. Sorry.

28:09.773 --> 28:10.774
Hey, what's your name?

28:11.441 --> 28:12.442
I'm Donna.

28:13.943 --> 28:17.364
Yeah, well, uh... Yeah,
I'll see you later, Donna.
I'm going for a walk.

28:17.447 --> 28:18.531
Want some company?

28:20.950 --> 28:21.951
Sure.

28:22.744 --> 28:24.329
Wait. I'll be right there.

28:27.332 --> 28:28.333
Uh...

28:28.458 --> 28:30.293
And he hasn't even
started playing.

29:35.400 --> 29:36.860
You walk pretty fast.

29:39.320 --> 29:40.697
This all you
wanted to do?

29:42.323 --> 29:43.491
We could sit down.

29:44.742 --> 29:45.743
Oh. Okay.

29:53.168 --> 29:55.003
So what do you do,
Donna?

29:55.753 --> 29:56.754
I screw people.

29:57.297 --> 29:58.298
Yeah?

29:58.381 --> 29:59.466
Mmm-hmm.

30:01.718 --> 30:03.761
Oh. So do I.

30:07.724 --> 30:09.309
Listen, uh...

30:10.226 --> 30:12.187
I was thinking about
getting rid of my virginity.

30:13.897 --> 30:14.939
Is that right?

30:15.064 --> 30:16.191
Yeah, that's right.

30:24.449 --> 30:25.742
Bishop to queen three.

30:27.118 --> 30:28.620
Bishop to knight five.

30:28.745 --> 30:30.246
Knight to knight five.

30:31.247 --> 30:34.292
Mmm. King rook
to queen one.

30:34.626 --> 30:37.128
Ah. Queen to knight four.

30:39.130 --> 30:42.217
Yeah, that's not even me.
That's Morphy versus Anderssen.

30:42.800 --> 30:45.386
Pawn to queen rook four.

30:46.763 --> 30:47.931
Queen to king seven.

30:48.473 --> 30:49.724
Queen takes queen.

30:49.807 --> 30:50.892
Rook takes queen.

30:51.935 --> 30:53.895
Shit!

30:54.437 --> 30:55.980
Hey. You ready?
Yeah.

30:56.397 --> 30:57.941
Background on the Soviets.

30:58.566 --> 30:59.901
You're kidding, right?

30:59.984 --> 31:02.570
Yeah, I know every game every one
of these guys has ever played.

31:02.654 --> 31:04.155
You know,
they're sitting by the pool

31:04.239 --> 31:06.908
at their fancy hotel,
laughing, having drinks.

31:08.117 --> 31:09.452
They have no idea.

31:10.286 --> 31:11.746
You guys coming?

31:12.288 --> 31:14.123
I think he's ready.
Yeah.

31:22.632 --> 31:24.801
Bobby's disappeared.
He'll be here.

31:24.884 --> 31:26.804
If he's not seated in three minutes,
he forfeits.

31:26.886 --> 31:28.763
He'll be here.
Yeah? A little prayer wouldn't hurt.

31:28.846 --> 31:30.473
I pray for his opponent.

31:32.684 --> 31:33.810
Bobby? You here?

31:33.977 --> 31:35.144
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:35.645 --> 31:37.730
What the hell? You've got, like,
seconds to take your seat.

31:37.814 --> 31:38.856
Great. If my mom comes,

31:38.982 --> 31:40.142
will you give that to her?
Yes.

31:40.191 --> 31:41.526
Yeah, she lives
in California now,

31:41.609 --> 31:42.860
so you never know.
She might show.

31:42.944 --> 31:44.654
Bobby, you've drawn
Ivanovich in the first round.

31:44.737 --> 31:47.574
Hey, whatever you do, don't let her get in.
It screws up my game.

31:47.657 --> 31:49.742
I told her she could
listen on the radio.

31:49.826 --> 31:52.954
Bobby, Ivanovich is officially the
third best chess player in the world.

31:53.496 --> 31:54.497
Fourth.

31:56.749 --> 31:57.750
Fourth.

32:01.045 --> 32:04.165
If he doesn't make his move in 60 seconds,
the game will be forfeited.

32:38.791 --> 32:40.126
Adjust.

33:30.677 --> 33:32.970
<i>Americans don't beat
Russians at chess.</i>

33:33.638 --> 33:35.515
<i>But it happened today
in Santa Monica.</i>

33:36.015 --> 33:39.018
<i>And when American chess sensation
Bobby Fischer's around,</i>

33:39.102 --> 33:40.895
<i>it just keeps on happening.</i>

33:44.440 --> 33:45.817
We have a problem.

33:52.657 --> 33:53.741
Mr. Fischer?

33:55.451 --> 33:58.204
Yeah. I've decided
I'm not playing again

33:58.287 --> 33:59.872
until all my conditions
are met.

34:01.708 --> 34:03.376
What conditions?

34:03.459 --> 34:07.213
Well, first off,
I want to arrive in a big black car,

34:07.296 --> 34:08.576
you know,
just like the Russians.

34:09.172 --> 34:11.050
Limousines cost money.

34:11.134 --> 34:13.974
And number two, you know I was on the
front page of the <i>L.A. Times</i> today?

34:14.011 --> 34:15.888
Ticket sales are through the roof.
Mmm-hmm.

34:15.972 --> 34:19.726
A thousand people are paying
$5 apiece just to see me play.

34:19.809 --> 34:21.436
That's $5,000.
Mmm.

34:21.518 --> 34:23.312
I want 30%. That's $1,500.

34:23.771 --> 34:24.813
Uh, Bobby...

34:24.897 --> 34:26.649
No. Money is respect, Paul.

34:27.567 --> 34:30.902
And number three, I want at least five
feet between me and the audience.

34:30.987 --> 34:32.739
You know,
I can smell their breath.

34:33.364 --> 34:35.074
It's almost like I hear their thoughts,
you know.

34:35.158 --> 34:36.993
My thoughts need
to be on the board.

34:42.831 --> 34:44.000
Is that all?

34:44.125 --> 34:45.251
Well, why don't you
have someone check

34:45.333 --> 34:47.094
and make sure our phones
aren't being bugged.

34:47.128 --> 34:48.504
The rest is on the list.

35:00.391 --> 35:01.392
Hey.

35:02.018 --> 35:05.313
Hi. So, I heard you won.

35:05.938 --> 35:07.440
So congrats.
Oh, thanks.

35:08.316 --> 35:10.067
What's wrong with
the phone in your room?

35:10.234 --> 35:12.361
Oh, I heard
this click-click,

35:12.445 --> 35:14.864
I thought maybe, you know,
my phone was bugged.

35:15.156 --> 35:16.491
Who you calling?
Uh, hold on...

35:16.783 --> 35:20.077
Uh, hello, operator?
I'm looking for a number for Regina Fischer.

35:21.037 --> 35:24.415
Uh... I don't know,
I thought maybe...

35:24.499 --> 35:25.875
Well, I don't know,
somewhere near the beach.

35:25.958 --> 35:27.084
I'm in Santa Monica,

35:27.168 --> 35:28.928
so I don't know,
maybe somewhere around here?

35:29.086 --> 35:31.047
I'm making sure my mom
doesn't come tomorrow.

35:31.380 --> 35:33.007
She can be distracting.

35:33.090 --> 35:34.801
And I'll say
hello to her and...

35:35.802 --> 35:37.386
Hello? Uh...

35:37.970 --> 35:41.474
Oh, okay.
Well, never mind, then.

35:45.019 --> 35:47.563
So, you wanna lose
your virginity tonight?

35:47.897 --> 35:49.106
Uh, oh, uh...

35:49.190 --> 35:50.691
Well, I haven't forgotten
about our arrangement,

35:50.775 --> 35:53.361
and I am looking forward
to it, but, uh...

35:54.028 --> 35:55.571
But I gotta stay
focused tonight.

35:56.197 --> 35:57.657
I slaughtered
one of them today,

35:57.740 --> 36:00.076
so tomorrow they're going
to come at me like banshees.

36:03.371 --> 36:04.372
Okay.

36:04.455 --> 36:05.957
All right. Uh...

36:06.082 --> 36:07.583
Well, good luck.
See you later.

36:16.008 --> 36:18.010
I passed up
having sex for this.

36:19.345 --> 36:21.013
Passed it up
for 20 years.

37:29.790 --> 37:32.168
So, Boris,
it looks like Bobby has improved his game.

37:32.251 --> 37:33.252
What do you think?

37:36.881 --> 37:40.051
<i>Tomorrow, a record crowd
will watch the American Bobby Fischer</i>

37:40.134 --> 37:42.011
<i>as he faces
Russian World Champion</i>

37:42.136 --> 37:44.013
<i>Boris Spassky
in the final match.</i>

37:44.847 --> 37:46.599
<i>Fischer, whose demands
for more money</i>

37:46.724 --> 37:48.517
<i>have infuriated
tournament promoters,</i>

37:49.143 --> 37:51.938
<i>has won a remarkable
eight matches in a row.</i>

37:52.563 --> 37:55.691
<i>But tomorrow will definitely
be his greatest test.</i>

37:57.985 --> 38:03.074
Pawn to king three.
Queen to king one.
Knight to rook four...

38:03.783 --> 38:05.034
What?

38:05.117 --> 38:06.285
Uh...

38:06.869 --> 38:08.371
I, uh...

38:08.955 --> 38:10.706
I like to play
the King's Indian,

38:10.831 --> 38:12.583
but he's an expert
on the Samisch, so...

38:12.667 --> 38:13.709
Who?

38:13.793 --> 38:16.003
Spassky. So I thought
maybe a Grunfeld,

38:16.087 --> 38:19.632
but then I have to find an answer
to pawn bishop four.

38:19.715 --> 38:22.718
You know, I was wondering,
did you reach your mom yet?

38:23.761 --> 38:25.388
I bet she'd be proud.

38:26.681 --> 38:27.890
Uh...

38:28.599 --> 38:31.268
I need to go through this.

38:31.394 --> 38:34.105
I need to work through this,
so I thought maybe...

38:34.855 --> 38:36.065
Uh...

38:38.859 --> 38:40.528
Sure. Yeah.

38:41.278 --> 38:42.571
Well, that was great
for me, too.

38:42.989 --> 38:43.990
Thank you.

38:44.073 --> 38:45.241
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

39:59.273 --> 40:00.483
How you feeling?

40:00.566 --> 40:01.567
I'm fine.

40:02.860 --> 40:03.861
Did you eat?

40:04.653 --> 40:06.113
You mind not talking?

40:14.121 --> 40:15.539
That's good.
Okay.

40:15.623 --> 40:16.624
Thanks.

40:45.653 --> 40:47.113
Bobby,
how does it feel to lose?

40:47.238 --> 40:48.697
That's a stupid question.

40:48.781 --> 40:51.867
How'd he beat you, Bob?
Would you understand if I answered that?

40:52.535 --> 40:53.828
He was playing to draw.

40:53.911 --> 40:55.955
Bobby, no one expected you
to beat Spassky.

40:56.038 --> 40:57.039
Yeah, I did.

40:57.123 --> 40:58.916
They're waiting to give you
the runner's-up medal.

40:58.999 --> 41:00.334
Ha! No thanks.

41:01.377 --> 41:04.713
At least, uh, talk to the TV people!
Oh, forget him. Forget him.

42:03.647 --> 42:05.441
He's disappeared.
He'll be back.

42:07.151 --> 42:08.611
What makes you
so sure?

42:08.736 --> 42:11.697
It's all that matters to him.
Without chess, he doesn't exist.

42:12.072 --> 42:13.616
You think he can
ever beat Spassky?

42:15.201 --> 42:16.493
Hypothetically,

42:17.328 --> 42:20.164
what would it take
to make him world champion?

42:21.957 --> 42:25.502
The desk clerk asked why we
were making so many calls to D.C.

42:25.586 --> 42:27.129
I haven't been calling D.C.

42:28.756 --> 42:30.049
Who've you been
talking to?

42:30.132 --> 42:31.717
There are people
in high places

42:31.800 --> 42:33.636
who take an interest
in any confrontation

42:33.719 --> 42:34.803
between us
and the Soviet Union.

42:34.887 --> 42:36.096
State Department? CIA?

42:36.805 --> 42:37.806
White House?

42:38.724 --> 42:40.601
Bobby wants limos,
he gets limos.

42:40.684 --> 42:43.103
And they'll throw
in "honorariums" for each victory.

42:43.187 --> 42:44.480
Paid for by whom?

42:46.857 --> 42:48.359
Are you a patriot, Father?

42:49.944 --> 42:50.986
Mostly.

42:52.112 --> 42:53.781
Bobby may be a little off,

42:53.864 --> 42:56.659
but he understands
this whole thing better than you.

42:56.742 --> 42:57.910
We're at war.

42:58.911 --> 43:02.915
Only it's not being fought
by guns and missiles. Not yet, at least.

43:03.207 --> 43:04.917
It's a war of perception.

43:05.626 --> 43:10.631
The poor kid from Brooklyn against
the whole Soviet Empire.

43:10.923 --> 43:12.591
The perfect American story.

43:12.675 --> 43:14.551
So your interest in
this is ideological.

43:17.554 --> 43:19.390
But what's in it for you?

43:20.057 --> 43:23.269
There's such a thing
as doing well by doing good.

43:24.103 --> 43:25.980
And you haven't
answered my question.

43:26.397 --> 43:27.606
Bobby Fischer...

43:28.816 --> 43:32.820
Bobby Fischer is the second best
chess player I've ever seen.

43:36.532 --> 43:38.172
He's also got severe
problems in his head.

43:38.200 --> 43:40.661
Which need to be
understood and managed.

43:40.744 --> 43:42.288
Managed? Bobby?

43:44.832 --> 43:46.458
You ever hear
of Paul Morphy?

43:47.501 --> 43:50.421
1855. Greatest player
this country ever had.

43:50.504 --> 43:53.590
Before Bobby, that is.
But by 21,

43:55.134 --> 43:57.761
he'd beat every
master in Europe.

43:58.846 --> 44:02.391
But then, things started
to get a little weird.

44:03.892 --> 44:07.021
He started having visions,
and became

44:08.188 --> 44:09.481
convinced that people
were trying to

44:09.565 --> 44:11.233
poison him, and he quit

44:12.484 --> 44:14.111
at 26,

44:14.737 --> 44:17.573
and eventually
killed himself

44:18.115 --> 44:21.035
in a bathtub surrounded by 12 pairs
of ladies' shoes.

44:23.120 --> 44:24.872
So, this game...

44:30.753 --> 44:32.129
It's a rabbit hole.

44:35.632 --> 44:39.511
After only four moves, there's more
than 300 billion options to consider.

44:39.595 --> 44:42.931
There's more 40-move games
than there are stars in the galaxy.

44:43.932 --> 44:47.728
So, it can take you
very close to the edge.

44:56.528 --> 44:57.780
Could he win?

45:02.242 --> 45:04.036
If Bobby were to go
for the title,

45:04.119 --> 45:05.679
it would mean
traveling around the world

45:05.704 --> 45:07.122
playing tournaments
for three years.

45:08.457 --> 45:10.542
In my opinion,
he might not make it that long.

45:10.626 --> 45:12.294
It's your job
to see that he does.

45:17.800 --> 45:18.842
If we can ever find him.

45:54.420 --> 45:55.504
Holy shit.

45:57.339 --> 45:58.507
They following me?

46:01.093 --> 46:02.177

47:06.658 --> 47:09.161
I feel good.
You know, these guys

<i>Over here, Bobby.

47:22.883 --> 47:26.553

47:27.221 --> 47:30.224
You know, I'm kinda
picking these guys off,

47:30.307 --> 47:31.767
but they've been
preparing for me,

47:31.892 --> 47:33.310

You're looking great.

48:40.669 --> 48:41.670
I have to see him.

48:42.713 --> 48:44.840
Every time I call,
they say his phone is broken.

48:46.717 --> 48:47.843
That happens.

48:48.302 --> 48:49.344
You mean he breaks them.

48:52.889 --> 48:54.516
I want to take him
to see a doctor.

48:55.934 --> 48:59.354
Uh, well, that just won't be possible.
He's already in Vancouver.

49:01.106 --> 49:02.107
These.

49:03.025 --> 49:04.234
Every week,

49:05.235 --> 49:06.612
his letters, they...

49:07.863 --> 49:09.031
They get more crazy.

49:09.865 --> 49:11.742
More crazy.
You take a look.
Go ahead.

49:12.075 --> 49:15.662
Um, they're private letters
to you, Joan. I, um...

49:17.039 --> 49:18.540
I respect his privacy.

49:19.916 --> 49:22.044
I showed them to
a psychiatrist friend.

49:23.045 --> 49:25.589
He said that Bobby
is displaying signs of, um...

49:27.424 --> 49:31.303
Of paranoia
and delusional psychosis.

49:31.386 --> 49:35.307
Well...
Chess is a crazy world.

49:35.891 --> 49:38.602
Some of the things he says
about the Soviets are true.

49:38.727 --> 49:42.230
In Tunis, we found listening devices
in his hotel room.

49:47.194 --> 49:52.407
"The Communists infect my mind
with words that just keep repeating.

49:52.824 --> 49:55.243
"The Jews
are helping them, too.

49:55.577 --> 49:58.622
"The Jews want to keep
the Chess Federation all to themselves,

49:58.747 --> 50:00.040
"just like they own
New York,

50:00.123 --> 50:02.501
"and own and control
most governments in the world."

50:02.584 --> 50:03.585
We...

50:04.544 --> 50:05.545
We are Jewish.

50:06.588 --> 50:08.548
Bobby is Jewish.
What do you people say to him

50:08.632 --> 50:10.008
when he comes out
with this trash?

50:10.092 --> 50:11.760
He doesn't listen to me.

50:13.011 --> 50:14.221
He doesn't listen
to anybody.

50:15.097 --> 50:18.141
Joanie, look. I swear,
this isn't just about the title anymore.

50:18.266 --> 50:20.268

of games he's playing.

50:20.769 --> 50:23.146

the crazy stuff,

50:26.108 --> 50:27.818
such unimaginable beauty.

A da Vinci, they're saying,
from Brooklyn.

50:31.697 --> 50:36.618

grandmasters are watching Bobby play

50:37.619 --> 50:39.371

52:23.892 --> 52:25.727
No, this is not
ordinary press, Bobby.

52:25.811 --> 52:27.896
I know, I know, I know.
I'll do the big ones.

52:27.979 --> 52:29.481
That's great.
That is great. Only...

52:29.564 --> 52:31.149
Hey, I'm starved.
Let's get some food.

52:31.233 --> 52:32.359
When we do these shows...

52:32.484 --> 52:34.486
Yeah... just go easy on
the bugging and the teeth.

52:34.569 --> 52:35.904
What are you
talking about?

52:36.238 --> 52:38.573
I'm just saying what's on my mind.
No, I know.

52:38.657 --> 52:40.033
I'm telling the truth.
I know. I know. I know.

52:40.158 --> 52:41.535
There's nothing wrong with what I'm saying.
I know.

52:41.660 --> 52:43.328
And people like that.
It's just, you need to be careful.

52:43.411 --> 52:45.163
Some things you say,
they can be misinterpreted.

52:45.247 --> 52:47.165
People get worried
when you talk like that.

52:47.249 --> 52:48.750
What are you saying?
"People get worried."

52:48.834 --> 52:50.168
Who? What people?
No one. No one.

52:50.252 --> 52:51.711
You're talking
about yourself.

52:51.795 --> 52:53.421
Which of these interviews
do you want to do?

52:53.505 --> 52:56.299
Now, wait a second.
What did you mean, "People begin to worry"?

52:56.424 --> 52:58.009
What are you talking about?
Doesn't matter.

52:58.093 --> 52:59.219
I think Cavett
is a great idea.

52:59.302 --> 53:00.846
Hey, what...
Why do you keep changing the subject?

53:00.929 --> 53:02.097
I'm not changing...
I'm asking you a question.

53:02.138 --> 53:04.018
You said people get worried.
What people?

53:07.727 --> 53:09.437
Uh... Joan.

53:09.521 --> 53:11.921
Joan? My sister?
How would you know that?
Did you talk to her?

53:11.982 --> 53:13.608
I was in New York.

53:15.277 --> 53:16.444
We, um...

53:17.445 --> 53:18.530
We had a cup
of coffee.

53:18.613 --> 53:20.699
You met with my sister?
Without telling me?

53:20.782 --> 53:22.117
What... Why would you
do that?

53:22.158 --> 53:24.278
She called me, Bobby.
What were you guys talking about?

53:24.327 --> 53:25.912
Were you talking about me?

53:25.996 --> 53:27.831
I was looking out
for your interests.

53:29.457 --> 53:31.177
That's my job.
Hey, don't "lawyer" me, Paul.

53:31.251 --> 53:32.611
I'm not trying to.
Don't lawyer me.

53:32.669 --> 53:34.921
You're talking with my family
behind my back.

53:35.005 --> 53:36.631
Did I ask you to do that?

53:37.132 --> 53:38.758
What were you doing?
You spying on me?

53:38.884 --> 53:40.385
I was trying to help you, Bobby.
I don't understand

53:40.468 --> 53:42.512
why you thought
that was a good idea.

53:42.596 --> 53:43.930
There are a hundred
more of you, you know.

53:44.014 --> 53:46.808
Just right behind you,
waiting in line to be here.

53:51.980 --> 53:53.815
Hey, pull over.
Um...

53:54.024 --> 53:55.984
Stop the car.
Wait a minute.
Bobby, Bobby.

53:56.067 --> 53:57.987
We're about to get everything
you've ever wanted.

53:58.028 --> 53:59.029
Stop the car!

53:59.112 --> 54:01.323
Pull over!
Stop the car now!

54:15.545 --> 54:17.005
Bishop, bishop six.

54:18.673 --> 54:19.674
Uh...

54:19.883 --> 54:21.051
King to queen four.

54:22.552 --> 54:23.678
Rook, rook five.

54:25.847 --> 54:27.015
Pawn to king five.

54:42.781 --> 54:43.823
So?

54:48.536 --> 54:49.829
He's back in his room.

54:50.330 --> 54:51.331
Is he okay?

54:51.831 --> 54:54.042
He's in there listening
to those tapes of his.

54:58.922 --> 55:01.716
Isn't that some kind
of God Squad?

55:03.051 --> 55:05.261
Those people know
as much about God as you do.

55:06.429 --> 55:08.098
I'd have thought
you'd approve.

55:12.519 --> 55:15.563
Should we try to get him to see someone?
A psychiatrist?

55:15.897 --> 55:17.148
Never gonna happen.

55:18.441 --> 55:21.277
Concierge told me he asked to have the TV
removed from his room

55:21.403 --> 55:24.003
'cause he thinks the Russians
are watching him through the screen.

55:24.531 --> 55:26.199
Maybe they are.

55:28.576 --> 55:32.414
He also believes they're gonna try
to blow up his plane.

55:35.709 --> 55:37.585
What good would a doctor do?

55:37.794 --> 55:39.087
Give him a diagnosis.

55:41.840 --> 55:42.841
Give him a pill.

55:42.924 --> 55:46.469
That would be like pouring
concrete down a holy well.

55:51.641 --> 55:53.727
<i>Bobby Fischer,
the United States Chess Champion,</i>

55:53.810 --> 55:57.731
<i>has challenged World Champion
Boris Spassky in a 24-game series.</i>

55:57.814 --> 56:00.066
...playing Boris Spassky.
Are you afraid?

56:00.150 --> 56:02.110
I'm not afraid of him.
He's afraid of me.

56:02.235 --> 56:05.030
Last time we played,
a couple of people said they saw him trembling.

56:06.239 --> 56:08.033
<i>Fischer, the first
American in history</i>

56:08.116 --> 56:10.326
<i>to reach the finals
of the World Championship,</i>

56:10.785 --> 56:13.830
<i>is the latest arrival
in our growing culture of celebrity.</i>

56:14.289 --> 56:15.957
<i>But who would have
thought that a chess player</i>

56:16.041 --> 56:18.126
<i>could suddenly become
a rock star?</i>

56:19.294 --> 56:22.172
<i>My next guest is prepared
to take on the Russians single-handed.</i>

56:22.297 --> 56:23.548
<i>And he may win.</i>

56:23.923 --> 56:26.801
<i>Will you welcome a bright boy from Brooklyn,
Mr. Bobby Fischer.</i>

56:29.804 --> 56:30.930
All right.

56:31.014 --> 56:32.724
Do you honestly think
that you probably

56:32.807 --> 56:34.434
are the world's
greatest chess player?

56:34.517 --> 56:35.769
Yeah. Yeah. Right.

56:37.687 --> 56:38.855
You know what
<i>LIFE</i> magazine said?

56:38.980 --> 56:41.483
"Bobby Fischer is single-handedly
changing the face of chess,

56:41.608 --> 56:43.109
"making it
the fastest-growing sport."

56:43.193 --> 56:44.736
<i>And what's the moment
of pleasure for you?</i>

56:44.819 --> 56:46.696
Is it when you see
the guy in trouble?

56:46.780 --> 56:48.156
What is the
greatest pleasure?

56:48.281 --> 56:50.825
What would correspond
to hitting the home run in baseball?

56:51.367 --> 56:52.494
Greatest pleasure?

56:53.703 --> 56:56.498
When you break his ego.
That's where it's at.

56:56.831 --> 56:58.333
<i>- Really?
- Yeah.</i>

56:59.793 --> 57:02.545
And when does that occur?
When he sees that he's finished?

57:02.837 --> 57:05.799
When he sees it coming.
And breaks all up inside.

57:07.509 --> 57:11.012
<i>Their goal is nothing short
of world domination.</i>

57:11.513 --> 57:15.266
<i>And unless they are stopped,
that goal will soon be within their grasp.</i>

57:15.975 --> 57:17.811
<i>Look at the godless
Soviet Union</i>

57:17.894 --> 57:20.814
<i>and their relentless march
across Eastern Europe.</i>

57:21.231 --> 57:23.024
<i>Look at the illegitimate
state of Israel,</i>

57:23.566 --> 57:27.779
<i>whose expansionist ambitions
have usurped Palestine from its true heirs</i>

57:27.862 --> 57:29.948
<i>in the kingdom of Judah.</i>

57:30.031 --> 57:33.451
<i>Indeed, the people of Israel
are not even the real Jews.</i>

57:33.535 --> 57:34.953
<i>That tribe was taken captive</i>

57:35.036 --> 57:38.540
<i>by King Nebuchadrezzar
of Babylon in 600 B.C...</i>

57:56.057 --> 57:57.767
Bobby, turn the music down.

57:57.892 --> 58:00.186
He doesn't want the Russians
to know what plane we're taking.

58:00.270 --> 58:03.148
And I want the food
to travel with us on the plane, Paul.

58:03.231 --> 58:04.315
You got it, Bobby.

58:04.399 --> 58:05.400
We have some issues.

58:05.483 --> 58:08.153
Yeah, well, the plane leaves in two hours.
With the traffic...

58:08.236 --> 58:10.655
And make sure there's enough oranges.
Check.

58:10.738 --> 58:12.907
There's never enough oranges.
Uh-huh.

58:13.408 --> 58:16.452
He wants all the food flown in and
prepared in front of him.

58:16.536 --> 58:17.537
Okay.

58:18.037 --> 58:22.917
He also wants $46,875
in his bank account before he plays.

58:23.251 --> 58:24.752
He'll pick up
the rest when he wins.

58:24.836 --> 58:26.546
Well, that's not going
to happen.

58:26.629 --> 58:28.089
Yeah, otherwise
he's not going.

58:28.715 --> 58:30.842
Which is what
he wants anyway.

58:31.426 --> 58:33.469
Hey, what are you guys
whispering about in there?

58:33.553 --> 58:36.431
Just talking travel plans, Bobby.
Who's traveling?

58:39.100 --> 58:40.540
You're really serious
about all this?

58:41.269 --> 58:42.770
They gotta give me
what I want.

58:42.854 --> 58:44.439
Mmm-hmm.
And if they don't?

58:44.772 --> 58:46.733
Well, we can play in this hotel room.
I like it here.

58:46.816 --> 58:47.859
Let me get this straight,

58:47.942 --> 58:49.694
you're willing to throw all this away
for money and oranges?

58:49.777 --> 58:52.488
That's right.
I don't need to play.
I know I'm the best.

58:52.572 --> 58:53.615
I think you're scared.

58:55.450 --> 58:56.650
And I think
you're overwhelmed.

58:57.577 --> 58:59.913
What is that, like,
um, pop psychology?

59:03.625 --> 59:04.792
Yeah.

59:07.170 --> 59:08.410
You've got the passports,
right?

59:08.463 --> 59:09.923
You've got them?
Yeah.

59:10.006 --> 59:11.049
I want my passport.

59:12.300 --> 59:13.885
Look, you...

59:16.137 --> 59:17.722
We're not leaving
for a half an hour.

59:17.805 --> 59:21.559
Yeah. Yeah, maybe I'll take a later flight.
Or not. Okay.

59:22.644 --> 59:23.645
Okay.

59:25.396 --> 59:27.565
Well, that's kind of funny,
seeing a priest get mad.

59:27.649 --> 59:29.817
I'm getting
on the phone right now.

59:30.485 --> 59:32.403
I'm gonna make this work.

59:32.487 --> 59:33.863
I don't mind either way.

59:33.947 --> 59:35.490
I really got
nothing to prove.

01:00:10.108 --> 01:00:12.193
I'm not so sure
about the deal, Paul.

01:00:13.027 --> 01:00:14.904
Well, um,
what's the issue, Bobby?

01:00:14.988 --> 01:00:16.388
I don't know.
Something's not right.

01:00:26.541 --> 01:00:28.626
We settled too low.
I ought to get 30%.

01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:30.712
Bobby, we agreed on 25%.

01:00:30.795 --> 01:00:33.006
Well, it's 30% now.
We agreed.

01:00:33.339 --> 01:00:35.049
Well, I changed
my mind, Paul.

01:00:35.133 --> 01:00:38.386
I understand that. But, Bobby, you just
can't change your mind like that.

01:00:38.511 --> 01:00:39.791
We're here.
We're at the airport.

01:00:39.846 --> 01:00:40.972
What am I supposed
to do about it?

01:00:41.055 --> 01:00:42.140
I don't have to
get on the plane.

01:00:42.223 --> 01:00:43.641
I don't know what you're supposed
to do about it.

01:00:43.725 --> 01:00:44.976
You're not gonna
get on the plane? Now?

01:00:45.059 --> 01:00:46.227
There he is!
Bobby! Bobby!

01:00:46.311 --> 01:00:47.562
What is this, Paul?

01:00:47.645 --> 01:00:48.771
I told you,
no photographers!

01:00:48.855 --> 01:00:49.856
Move it!
Out of the way!

01:00:49.939 --> 01:00:50.982
All right, fine.

01:00:51.065 --> 01:00:52.233
Bobby! Bobby!

01:01:05.496 --> 01:01:07.248
Where to?
Just go! Drive!

01:01:14.839 --> 01:01:17.719
<i>Another bizarre turn today
in the World Chess Championships,</i>

01:01:17.759 --> 01:01:21.137
<i>when Bobby Fischer failed to
appear for the opening ceremonies.</i>

01:01:21.429 --> 01:01:24.682
<i>Meanwhile, Bobby's opponent,
Boris Spassky, arrived in Reykjavík today,</i>

01:01:24.766 --> 01:01:27.268
<i>to the excitement
of all of Iceland.</i>

01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:30.438
<i>FIDE adjudicator,
Wolfgang Schmidt, had this to say.</i>

01:01:30.938 --> 01:01:33.274
I am honored but confused.

01:01:33.399 --> 01:01:37.070
I was always led to believe
that chess needed two people for a game.

01:01:37.862 --> 01:01:39.947
Unfortunately,
our American friends

01:01:40.031 --> 01:01:42.658
have managed to lose
their famous Mr. Bobby Fischer.

01:01:43.034 --> 01:01:44.494
Ooh!

01:01:44.702 --> 01:01:47.372
One hopes they are
not so careless with their nuclear weapons.

01:01:48.915 --> 01:01:50.458
Mr. Tremblay,
is Bobby not showing

01:01:50.541 --> 01:01:52.043
affecting Iceland
relationships?

01:01:52.126 --> 01:01:54.796
Is it true he denied
$2 million to come to Reykjavík?

01:01:54.879 --> 01:01:56.714
I love chess.
The world loves chess.

01:01:56.798 --> 01:01:58.132
We are here
to celebrate chess.

01:01:58.216 --> 01:01:59.217
Excuse us, please.

01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:00.718
<i>Still no sign

01:02:00.802 --> 01:02:03.846
<i>the American chess player

01:02:03.930 --> 01:02:06.391
<i>Fischer today was supposed to be

01:02:06.474 --> 01:02:09.060

<i>in what promises to be

01:02:14.315 --> 01:02:16.235
<i>Fischer is still

01:02:16.317 --> 01:02:17.819

Mama?
Yeah, baby?

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:20.905
There are men
on the lawn.

01:02:21.656 --> 01:02:23.574
<i>Today the International
Chess Federation said,</i>

01:02:23.658 --> 01:02:26.411
<i>"If Fischer is not

<i>"he will be disqualified."</i>

01:02:50.852 --> 01:02:52.979
Yeah. I, uh...

01:02:53.479 --> 01:02:55.022
They promised me
no photographers,

01:02:55.148 --> 01:02:56.357
and a bunch of them
showed up,

01:02:56.441 --> 01:02:57.650
so I had to get out
of there.

01:02:57.859 --> 01:02:58.860
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:02:58.943 --> 01:03:00.862

<i>So, I was going

01:03:06.993 --> 01:03:08.870
I had to show them, Joan.

01:03:09.454 --> 01:03:11.747
They told me
no photographers.

01:03:11.831 --> 01:03:13.291
They keep
doing this to me,

01:03:13.374 --> 01:03:15.209
everywhere I go,
all the time.

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:18.129
People keep doing this to me.
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:03:18.212 --> 01:03:19.213
It's not fair.

01:03:20.339 --> 01:03:21.883
Hey, Bobby, are you okay?

01:03:22.175 --> 01:03:24.427
<i>Well, you know that
727 that went down?</i>

01:03:24.510 --> 01:03:26.804
You know, they said
the fuel tank exploded.

01:03:27.889 --> 01:03:30.892
Yeah, well, that seemed
kind of funny to me. Right?

01:03:30.975 --> 01:03:32.810
<i>You know, they don't
tell us everything.</i>

01:03:32.894 --> 01:03:35.104
Yeah, no, they don't,
that's true.

01:03:35.188 --> 01:03:39.317
<i>And the KGB, they kill people.
They do. That's real.</i>

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:42.570
<i>They put poison on the tips
of their umbrellas... Crazy things.</i>

01:03:42.653 --> 01:03:44.197
<i>You understand?</i>
Yeah.

01:03:45.239 --> 01:03:48.493
Baby, you stay there, okay?
I'm going to come over.

01:03:48.576 --> 01:03:51.287
These people,
I wouldn't put anything past them.

01:03:51.871 --> 01:03:55.333
Who? Who people, Bobby?
<i>The Russians. You believe me.</i>

01:03:55.917 --> 01:03:58.377
They would like it if
I dropped dead tonight.

01:03:59.670 --> 01:04:01.088
You hear that?

01:04:02.256 --> 01:04:04.091
Oh, my God.
<i>What? Do I hear what?</i>

01:04:04.175 --> 01:04:05.551
Shh.

01:04:07.428 --> 01:04:09.013
I don't know.
There's a noise on the phone.

01:04:09.096 --> 01:04:10.181
Do you hear it?

01:04:10.264 --> 01:04:11.682
<i>No, I don't hear anything.</i>

01:04:13.935 --> 01:04:15.269
Bobby?

01:04:19.565 --> 01:04:23.611
We have a NATO base out there and
I asked for the Marines to guard me.

01:04:24.111 --> 01:04:26.864
They said no to me.
They said no, Joan!

01:04:26.948 --> 01:04:30.117
With all the prestige
I am bringing to this country.

01:04:30.201 --> 01:04:32.328
I'm the most
famous man in the world.

01:04:33.621 --> 01:04:34.622
Do you hear that?

01:04:35.748 --> 01:04:39.961
<i>They put stuff in my food
to mess with my mind, you know?</i>

01:04:40.545 --> 01:04:41.712
I don't know.

01:04:41.796 --> 01:04:43.881
<i>Bobby, you stay there.
I'm gonna come over.</i>

01:04:44.131 --> 01:04:47.134
No, no, no.
Listen... Joan, listen to me.

01:04:48.135 --> 01:04:49.845
I'm trying to
tell you something.

01:04:50.930 --> 01:04:53.516
I keep...
I keep thinking about this.

01:04:54.559 --> 01:04:57.436
<i>Just going over it
and over it and over it in my mind.</i>

01:04:58.145 --> 01:05:01.148
I can't figure out
what's next, Joan.

01:05:02.984 --> 01:05:04.610
Do you know what I mean?
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:05:04.652 --> 01:05:07.697
Do you understand?
<i>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I understand, baby, yeah.</i>

01:05:11.659 --> 01:05:12.702
Bobby...
Shh!

01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:16.998
<i>Joan. God damn it,
do you hear that?</i>

01:05:23.254 --> 01:05:24.672
There's a noise.

01:05:26.591 --> 01:05:27.592
Joan.

01:05:31.846 --> 01:05:33.931
I gotta get off the phone.
Bobby, you...

01:05:47.069 --> 01:05:48.070
Uh...

01:05:48.279 --> 01:05:49.363
Who's there?

01:05:49.488 --> 01:05:50.823
Hey, pal,
you in there?

01:05:53.117 --> 01:05:55.494
Hey, can I come in?
Got big news.

01:05:55.828 --> 01:05:56.828
Yeah, what's that?

01:05:56.871 --> 01:06:00.416
You wanted more money?
I just got you an extra 130K.

01:06:00.791 --> 01:06:04.211
Some English chess nut
wants to see you play so bad.

01:06:05.796 --> 01:06:07.131
Is the money real?

01:06:07.214 --> 01:06:09.592
It's real.
It's good. It's secure.

01:06:10.343 --> 01:06:12.845
May I use your phone?
Let folks know you're okay?

01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:18.017
Hey, who's that?
That's, uh, security.

01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:19.352
They've fixed it
for us at the airport.

01:06:19.435 --> 01:06:21.771
We can go straight
to the plane. No press.

01:06:25.232 --> 01:06:28.402
Yes. Hello?
I found him.

01:06:30.321 --> 01:06:31.739
Henry Kissinger.

01:06:34.158 --> 01:06:35.451
Pretty amazing, huh?

01:06:39.205 --> 01:06:40.247
Hello?

01:06:40.331 --> 01:06:41.832
<i>Dr. Kissinger's
on the line.</i>

01:06:43.209 --> 01:06:45.836
<i>Hello, this is
the worst chess player in the world</i>

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:48.047
<i>calling the best
chess player in the world.</i>

01:06:49.173 --> 01:06:51.717
<i>We just want you to know,
the President and I,</i>

01:06:51.801 --> 01:06:53.481
<i>that we are thrilled
that you will be going</i>

01:06:53.552 --> 01:06:55.805
<i>to Iceland to play
for the U.S.A., Bobby.</i>

01:06:57.848 --> 01:06:59.684
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

01:07:00.643 --> 01:07:02.061
I decided to play.

01:07:05.648 --> 01:07:07.817
<i>This is
the BBC World Service.</i>

01:07:08.526 --> 01:07:10.945
<i>American chess
Grandmaster Bobby Fischer</i>

01:07:11.028 --> 01:07:13.489
<i>is believed to be
finally on his way to Iceland</i>

01:07:13.572 --> 01:07:15.282
<i>for his match
with Boris Spassky.</i>

01:07:25.376 --> 01:07:27.795
This is how we used to
get Jagger out of here.

01:07:27.878 --> 01:07:29.588
<i>After months
of negotiation,</i>

01:07:29.672 --> 01:07:33.008
<i>Fischer will now face
the current world champion, Boris Spassky.</i>

01:07:33.092 --> 01:07:34.510
What do you think
of Bobby?

01:07:34.593 --> 01:07:35.803
I don't know.

01:07:37.054 --> 01:07:39.390
At least there's one reason
to feel good about America.

01:07:39.473 --> 01:07:40.891
A bit impolite.

01:07:40.975 --> 01:07:43.102
Fischer is to chess
like Ali is to boxing.

01:07:43.185 --> 01:07:46.564
He's tedious, he's arrogant,
he's inconsiderate.

01:07:46.647 --> 01:07:49.607
<i>At long last, Bobby Fischer
arrived in Reykjavik today</i>

01:07:49.650 --> 01:07:52.361
<i>after months of speculation
that he wouldn't appear at all.</i>

01:07:52.445 --> 01:07:55.573
Yeah, well, the Russians have been
telling lies about me since I was a kid.

01:07:55.656 --> 01:07:57.158
How do you like
Iceland, Bobby?

01:07:57.241 --> 01:07:59.577
Iceland? Yeah, I'm, uh,
happy to be here.

01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:01.245
I feel like a Viking,
ready to conquer.

01:08:17.803 --> 01:08:21.307
Come on in.
Take a look around.
Yeah.

01:08:21.390 --> 01:08:22.390
There's good.

01:08:22.892 --> 01:08:24.560
It's five bedrooms.

01:08:26.395 --> 01:08:27.897
Place even has a sauna.

01:08:28.022 --> 01:08:30.274
All right. I'm gonna check out the rooms,
see which one I want.

01:08:30.357 --> 01:08:31.358
Go for it.

01:08:37.698 --> 01:08:38.698
Yeah?

01:08:42.870 --> 01:08:44.205
Ah.

01:08:44.412 --> 01:08:45.706
Hey, uh...

01:08:47.041 --> 01:08:48.125
What are you doing here?

01:08:53.546 --> 01:08:54.631
I took a little time.

01:08:56.216 --> 01:08:57.218
All right.

01:09:01.138 --> 01:09:04.015
You want to work?
Want to analyze some positions?

01:09:04.099 --> 01:09:05.309
Maybe later.

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:07.394
What's wrong, you sick?

01:09:07.478 --> 01:09:08.938
I'm just taking a break.

01:09:11.273 --> 01:09:13.901
Okay. I'll check up
on you in a few hours.

01:09:15.152 --> 01:09:17.154
It's good to see you, Bobby.

01:09:18.697 --> 01:09:19.907
Yeah, sure.

01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:26.412
Couldn't stay away, huh?

01:09:27.747 --> 01:09:28.749
I get it.

01:09:29.416 --> 01:09:32.336
Yankees are playing in the series,
you want a seat in the dugout.

01:09:32.627 --> 01:09:34.087
Can I get one of these?

01:09:37.966 --> 01:09:41.303
Billion people around the world watching
two guys play chess.

01:09:42.888 --> 01:09:45.558
Nixon's put a TV
in the Oval Office.

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:46.809
Oh, yeah?
Mmm.

01:09:46.892 --> 01:09:48.435
World War III
on a chess board.

01:09:52.106 --> 01:09:53.399
We lost China.

01:09:54.608 --> 01:09:56.068
We're losing Vietnam.

01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:01.240
We have to win this one.

01:10:18.299 --> 01:10:20.175
This is <i>ABC's</i>
<i>Wide World of Sports,</i>

01:10:20.259 --> 01:10:23.637
bringing you live coverage
of the World Championship of Chess.

01:10:23.971 --> 01:10:25.556
<i>Best of 24 games.</i>

01:10:25.639 --> 01:10:29.059
<i>Each win is worth a point,
each draw is half a point.</i>

01:10:29.393 --> 01:10:33.397
It's the chess version
of a 15-round heavyweight prize fight.

01:10:34.773 --> 01:10:38.068
And the noise from the crowd tells us
that Boris Spassky...

01:10:43.032 --> 01:10:46.243
...in what will surely be
a historic confrontation.

01:11:02.384 --> 01:11:03.719
Where is he?

01:11:43.092 --> 01:11:45.427
If the press could
please take their seats.

01:11:45.511 --> 01:11:48.639
We will now come together
for the drawing of the colors.

01:11:49.223 --> 01:11:50.223
Mr. Spassky?

01:11:50.265 --> 01:11:51.475
Mr. Fischer, choose.

01:11:56.021 --> 01:11:58.565
Mr. Fischer chose black.
Mr. Spassky will begin.

01:12:47.322 --> 01:12:49.158
So far, so good, yeah?

01:12:49.450 --> 01:12:52.119
Mmm. They're playing
a variation on a Nimzo.

01:12:52.411 --> 01:12:54.204
A draw would be fine
for our side.

01:13:12.806 --> 01:13:14.308
Is that bad?

01:13:14.391 --> 01:13:16.477
No, no.
It simplifies the game.

01:14:13.367 --> 01:14:15.702
The cameras are making too much noise.
It's distracting.

01:14:15.786 --> 01:14:16.829
I'll be back.

01:14:17.371 --> 01:14:18.455
From the cameras?

01:14:18.539 --> 01:14:20.659
Yeah, they're going like...

01:14:24.628 --> 01:14:25.754
Come here.

01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:33.554
Do you hear that?

01:14:33.679 --> 01:14:34.721
It's just a camera.

01:14:34.805 --> 01:14:36.056
Yeah. Well,
you've got to move it back.

01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:37.141
What?

01:14:37.224 --> 01:14:40.936
Move the camera back.
Move it back.
Move the camera back.

01:14:41.061 --> 01:14:43.272
You've got to get
the audience under control, too.

01:14:43.397 --> 01:14:45.399
What's wrong with the audience?
They're making too much noise

01:14:45.482 --> 01:14:47.109
and you're not doing anything about it.
That's your job.

01:14:47.192 --> 01:14:49.111
All right? Do your job.

01:14:50.070 --> 01:14:52.573
Mr. Spassky's made
his move. It's good.

01:15:01.123 --> 01:15:02.249
Yes, yes.

01:15:02.374 --> 01:15:05.919
Mr. Schmidt, he's trying
to upset my player.

01:15:06.003 --> 01:15:09.006
You see, the camera was making noise,
we just moved it back.

01:15:09.089 --> 01:15:10.632
He is upsetting
my player.

01:15:10.716 --> 01:15:13.010
Yes, it's fine.
If you could just take your seats, please.

01:15:13.093 --> 01:15:14.303
Thank you.

01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:21.722
You don't look well,
Robert James.

01:17:51.126 --> 01:17:54.254
First game goes to
Boris Spassky.

01:18:14.775 --> 01:18:18.320
Bobby! Bobby!
Hold on a second!

01:18:18.445 --> 01:18:20.864
- Don't yell at him.
- I'm not yelling at him. Bobby!

01:18:21.281 --> 01:18:22.282
Bobby.

01:18:23.450 --> 01:18:25.452
It's just one game.

01:18:25.535 --> 01:18:27.287
One point.
You'll take the next one.

01:18:28.038 --> 01:18:31.041
Twelve and a half points
is a long match.

01:18:33.502 --> 01:18:35.670
The reporters will
go after Spassky.

01:18:35.754 --> 01:18:37.130
We could slip out
another way.

01:18:39.466 --> 01:18:40.467
You all right?

01:18:41.676 --> 01:18:43.011
You hear that?

01:18:44.388 --> 01:18:45.722
It's quiet in here.

01:18:46.973 --> 01:18:49.017
Boris! Boris!

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:51.853
How did you feel?

01:19:59.546 --> 01:20:01.006
How you doing, Bobby?

01:20:01.798 --> 01:20:03.008
I'm not going
to do it anymore.

01:20:03.091 --> 01:20:04.301
Do what?

01:20:04.384 --> 01:20:06.803
Play with all of these distractions.
It's like a circus.

01:20:07.929 --> 01:20:09.473
It's not what we agreed to.

01:20:10.390 --> 01:20:12.809
You know, they've been
doing this to me for years.

01:20:12.893 --> 01:20:15.187
Making me all these promises, and they all
turn out to be lies.

01:20:15.270 --> 01:20:17.397
They've been doing it to me
since I was a kid.

01:20:17.481 --> 01:20:20.692
You know, I would get stuck in Europe
with huge hotel room bills

01:20:20.775 --> 01:20:22.277
when I was 15 years old.

01:20:23.278 --> 01:20:25.238
The Federation
would raise money

01:20:25.322 --> 01:20:27.824
off of my back and
funnel it to Reshevsky.

01:20:28.408 --> 01:20:30.494
Another Jew, by the way.
I don't know what I ever did to them.

01:20:30.577 --> 01:20:32.897
And they're all out to screw me,
the Russians and the Jews.

01:20:33.413 --> 01:20:35.813
They got their dirty
little fingerprints all over everything.

01:20:36.833 --> 01:20:38.752
What are we talking about?
The Jews.

01:20:38.835 --> 01:20:39.836
Ah.

01:20:40.003 --> 01:20:41.338
Bobby, you made
a stupid mistake

01:20:41.421 --> 01:20:42.380
and you got your
ass handed to you.

01:20:42.464 --> 01:20:44.049
No. I am not going to
submit to their game...

01:20:44.132 --> 01:20:45.300
If you don't get
your head in the game...

01:20:45.383 --> 01:20:46.968
We are going to play my way,
with no audience...

01:20:47.093 --> 01:20:48.762
...you're not just going to lose.
...and no distractions!

01:20:48.845 --> 01:20:50.847
You're going to get humiliated in
front of billions of people.

01:20:50.931 --> 01:20:54.851
You guys brought me here under false pretenses,
and you're going to fix it!

01:20:56.645 --> 01:20:58.438
This is how I play!

01:21:06.154 --> 01:21:10.367
You know, his mistake
is that he didn't see this bishop.

01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:13.680
Unless the rest of
the games are played

01:21:13.745 --> 01:21:15.580
without an audience
and without cameras,

01:21:15.664 --> 01:21:17.082
he isn't going to show up.

01:21:20.502 --> 01:21:22.712
He won't continue unless the games
are played in the Ping-Pong room?

01:21:22.796 --> 01:21:24.881
That's the only place
that's quiet, he says.

01:21:24.965 --> 01:21:26.550
He also wants
a different board.

01:21:26.633 --> 01:21:29.636
It makes too much noise
when he puts the pieces down.

01:21:29.719 --> 01:21:31.471
He prefers wood.

01:21:32.305 --> 01:21:34.724
It's like Morphy,
it's destroying his brain.

01:21:34.975 --> 01:21:36.601
No, chess isn't
destroying him.

01:21:36.685 --> 01:21:38.845
Why all the demands?
It's like he wants them to say no.

01:21:39.813 --> 01:21:41.973
I think he's afraid of
what's gonna happen if he loses.

01:21:42.315 --> 01:21:44.901
No. He's afraid of what's going to
happen if he wins.

01:21:56.746 --> 01:21:59.874
If the press...
If the press could please take their seats.

01:22:00.667 --> 01:22:03.420
The match was scheduled
to begin at 5:00.

01:22:04.296 --> 01:22:05.797
We will now
start the clock.

01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:38.705
Mr. Fischer failed to show.

01:22:39.205 --> 01:22:41.791
Mr. Spassky
wins by forfeit.

01:22:42.751 --> 01:22:44.836
According to
Federation rules,

01:22:45.211 --> 01:22:48.632
Mr. Fischer has 24 hours
to indicate in writing

01:22:48.715 --> 01:22:50.133
that he wishes to continue,

01:22:50.216 --> 01:22:53.386
otherwise Mr. Spassky
will be declared world champion.

01:22:55.388 --> 01:22:58.224
<i>The match between
Boris Spassky and Bobby Fischer</i>

01:22:58.308 --> 01:23:00.977
<i>has taken a decidedly
disappointing turn.</i>

01:23:01.353 --> 01:23:03.229
<i>- News in Reykjavik,
- Iceland today,</i>

01:23:03.396 --> 01:23:05.231
<i>Bobby Fischer
failed to show up...</i>

01:23:05.315 --> 01:23:07.596
<i>...the match is Spassky's,
regardless of what happens now.</i>

01:23:07.651 --> 01:23:10.278
<i>A two-point advantage is considered
practically insurmountable.</i>

01:23:14.699 --> 01:23:17.869
<i>Unpredictable
Bobby Fischer stayed in bed today</i>

01:23:17.952 --> 01:23:19.704
<i>rather than show up
for Game Two</i>

01:23:19.788 --> 01:23:22.666
<i>in his world title match
with chess champion Boris Spassky.</i>

01:23:22.999 --> 01:23:25.460
<i>The future of the match
now is clouded in doubt,</i>

01:23:25.543 --> 01:23:28.088
<i>although Game Three
is still scheduled for Sunday.</i>

01:24:13.091 --> 01:24:14.300
Bobby?

01:24:14.843 --> 01:24:17.262
I have messages
from people all over the world

01:24:17.345 --> 01:24:19.347
who want you
to open this door.

01:24:23.476 --> 01:24:25.019
Bobby?

01:24:48.752 --> 01:24:52.338
The President of
the United States called three times.

01:24:52.714 --> 01:24:53.882
Three.

01:24:54.966 --> 01:24:58.011
Ah, well. He's been
trying to reach you.

01:24:59.971 --> 01:25:01.181
In Moscow,

01:25:02.515 --> 01:25:08.688
Brezhnev opened
his only bottle of 1868 Louis Roederer.

01:25:09.105 --> 01:25:11.941
Left over from the Revolution.
You know why?

01:25:12.567 --> 01:25:15.779
Because he heard you quit.

01:25:18.364 --> 01:25:21.826
There are boys your age in Vietnam
giving their lives right now

01:25:21.910 --> 01:25:23.328
in the fight
against Communism,

01:25:23.411 --> 01:25:26.498
and all you have to do
is play a game of chess.

01:25:36.966 --> 01:25:41.387
Bobby. I've been arguing
on your behalf all night long.

01:25:43.932 --> 01:25:46.476
I've been
threatening them for you.

01:25:46.559 --> 01:25:50.730
I have cajoled, I have begged them,
now I'm begging you.

01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:54.692
Please, please, please.

01:25:55.652 --> 01:25:57.487
Go back in there and play.

01:26:00.740 --> 01:26:01.940
You're one of them,
aren't you?

01:26:02.909 --> 01:26:04.786
What?
Who got to you?

01:26:06.079 --> 01:26:08.373
KGB? CIA?

01:26:08.456 --> 01:26:09.749
Are you serious?

01:26:15.922 --> 01:26:17.590
<i>This is BBC News.</i>

01:26:18.341 --> 01:26:21.511

01:26:21.845 --> 01:26:23.721
<i>for the American,
Bobby Fischer,</i>

01:26:23.805 --> 01:26:26.057

01:29:35.246 --> 01:29:36.330
Thank you.

01:29:38.583 --> 01:29:39.625
You won't believe it.

01:29:39.959 --> 01:29:42.045
Spassky's agreed to play
in the Ping-Pong room.

01:29:43.963 --> 01:29:45.173
Yeah. Right.

01:29:46.132 --> 01:29:47.842
Wait,
where are you going?

01:29:50.053 --> 01:29:54.140
Only one camera.
It does not move.
It makes no sound.

01:29:58.644 --> 01:29:59.812
Good?

01:30:01.981 --> 01:30:03.608
Good day, thank you.

01:30:04.317 --> 01:30:05.318
<i>Spasibo.</i>

01:30:07.779 --> 01:30:09.947
So, please, gentlemen.

01:30:10.490 --> 01:30:13.493
If we can remember,
the world is watching.

01:30:21.834 --> 01:30:23.211
Did Nixon really call you?

01:30:23.294 --> 01:30:24.629
Game's starting.

01:31:14.011 --> 01:31:15.555
What's he doing?

01:31:16.514 --> 01:31:17.515
I don't know.

01:31:27.233 --> 01:31:28.901
He's playing the Benoni.
Black, two games down.

01:31:28.985 --> 01:31:30.528
He thinks it's suicide.

01:31:30.736 --> 01:31:31.821
Is it suicide?

01:31:31.946 --> 01:31:33.030
Yeah.

01:32:27.376 --> 01:32:28.878
What's happening?
He's exposing his king.

01:32:28.961 --> 01:32:30.296
He's going to end up with
doubled-up pawns here.

01:32:30.588 --> 01:32:32.468
And yet he wants him
to take it with the bishop.

01:33:12.838 --> 01:33:14.799
Yeah, shit.

01:33:53.879 --> 01:33:55.464
Oh, my God.

01:34:03.431 --> 01:34:04.807
He's threatening mate
in one.

01:34:04.932 --> 01:34:06.892
He's going to force
the exchange of these knights.

01:34:10.813 --> 01:34:11.981
He hates draws.

01:34:15.067 --> 01:34:16.110
He takes him.

01:34:27.538 --> 01:34:28.706
Check.

01:35:45.825 --> 01:35:46.951
Go U.S.A.!

01:35:48.202 --> 01:35:49.829
Bobby! Bobby!

<i>This is really amazing, Jim.</i>

01:36:08.139 --> 01:36:09.932
<i>You can't imagine

Excuse me?

01:36:15.354 --> 01:36:16.605
Spassky took
Bobby's bishop.

01:36:17.273 --> 01:36:19.233
Yeah, well,
I took his virginity.

01:36:19.525 --> 01:36:21.152
Oh, wait, wait.
Bobby's making a move.

01:36:22.194 --> 01:36:24.321
Excuse me?
They drew Game Four last night, you know?

01:36:24.613 --> 01:36:26.533
Yeah, we know, asshole,
we're watching the rerun.

01:38:16.225 --> 01:38:19.520
Game Five goes
to Mr. Bobby Fischer.

01:38:44.795 --> 01:38:45.963
Mr. Spassky.

01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:49.258
An electrical engineer
examined the light fixture

01:38:49.341 --> 01:38:51.844
and made
an astounding discovery.

01:38:52.344 --> 01:38:55.014
Inside, he found this.

01:38:55.556 --> 01:38:56.682
Two dead flies.

01:39:03.188 --> 01:39:06.817
<i>Bobby Fischer's comeback in this match.
That's historic in chess.</i>

01:39:07.026 --> 01:39:08.777
<i>Certainly, Jim.
And at this stage,</i>

01:39:08.861 --> 01:39:10.779
<i>it looks as though
whoever wins this game</i>

01:39:10.863 --> 01:39:12.990
<i>will most likely go on
to take the entire match.</i>

01:39:13.073 --> 01:39:15.784
<i>This one game, Game Six,
will determine the outcome?</i>

01:39:15.868 --> 01:39:16.869
I certainly think so.

01:39:17.202 --> 01:39:19.455
<i>Well, now we'll just
have to see what happens.</i>

01:39:19.538 --> 01:39:22.041
<i>Fischer has agreed to return
to play in the Main Hall.</i>

01:39:24.209 --> 01:39:26.712
Press can step back,
please. Thank you.

01:40:22.184 --> 01:40:23.310
What's he doing?

01:40:23.936 --> 01:40:26.188
<i>We all can't quite
believe it up here, Jim,</i>

01:40:26.271 --> 01:40:28.440
<i>but in this,
the pivotal game of the match,</i>

01:40:28.774 --> 01:40:31.860
<i>Fischer has abandoned
his trademark Sicilian opening.</i>

01:40:32.111 --> 01:40:36.198
<i>All of Spassky's careful preparation
is suddenly out the window.</i>

01:40:56.969 --> 01:40:59.680
<i>Grandmasters are shaking
their heads in confusion.</i>

01:40:59.763 --> 01:41:02.349
<i>Fischer's moves
are unprecedented in chess history.</i>

01:41:02.725 --> 01:41:06.145
<i>No one seems to be
able to decipher what he's doing.</i>

01:42:53.126 --> 01:42:54.294
Bravo.

01:43:09.810 --> 01:43:12.855
<i>Grandmasters never applaud
an opponent's victory,</i>

01:43:13.105 --> 01:43:16.149
<i>but I guess this is something
no one has ever seen before.</i>

01:44:24.509 --> 01:44:26.219
Bobby?
Can I get you anything?

01:44:27.387 --> 01:44:28.555
No, thanks.

01:44:30.515 --> 01:44:32.184
It'll be light soon.

01:44:32.726 --> 01:44:34.519
Yeah, it's never
really dark here.

01:44:49.993 --> 01:44:50.994
Bobby.

01:44:54.373 --> 01:44:56.792
The chess you've been playing
is really inspired.

01:45:07.260 --> 01:45:10.597
It's almost all
theory and memorization.

01:45:12.391 --> 01:45:14.559
People think there are
all these options,

01:45:17.688 --> 01:45:19.564
but there's usually
one right move.

01:45:21.066 --> 01:45:23.735
Of course, in the end,
there's no place to go.

01:47:30.695 --> 01:47:33.865
<i>The United States
is based on lies, it's based on theft.</i>

01:47:33.949 --> 01:47:35.269
<i>Look at all I've
done for the U.S.</i>

01:47:35.325 --> 01:47:37.577
<i>But now I'm not
useful anymore, you see?</i>

01:47:37.661 --> 01:47:41.206
<i>The Cold War is over,
and now they want to put me in prison.</i>

01:47:43.625 --> 01:47:47.254
<i>I'm not sure,
but if I know the Jews and the U.S.,</i>

01:47:47.337 --> 01:47:50.715
<i>they may come at me
with some attack I don't expect.</i>

01:47:51.216 --> 01:47:54.803
<i>Life is like that when people are
living in a dream world.</i>

01:47:54.886 --> 01:47:56.805
<i>It's not really paradoxical.</i>

01:47:57.222 --> 01:48:00.725
<i>Chess is basically
a search for truth, right?</i>

01:48:01.226 --> 01:48:03.770
<i>So, I'm searching
for the truth.</i>
