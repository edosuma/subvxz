[wind howling]

02:19.758 --> 02:22.719
[heart monitor beeps steadily]

02:24.804 --> 02:26.765
[whispers] I'm so cold.

02:29.559 --> 02:31.686
Why is there no heat?

02:32.520 --> 02:33.438
[exhales]

02:33.521 --> 02:36.816
[heart monitor echoes]

02:36.900 --> 02:38.484
[whispers] Riley.

02:40.028 --> 02:41.613
[whispers] Magnus.

02:43.489 --> 02:45.075
Come with me.

02:49.412 --> 02:51.539
You stupid girl.

02:55.001 --> 02:57.378
I told you this would happen.

02:59.589 --> 03:01.216
[voice breaks] I'm sorry.

03:03.885 --> 03:06.805
You've been apologizing
your whole life.

03:07.931 --> 03:10.642
You won't have to anymore.

03:10.725 --> 03:13.353
- [gasps softly]
- [Yrsa] Yes...

03:18.233 --> 03:20.360
you're going to die here.

03:23.822 --> 03:27.075
- [gasps]
- What? God, what? Nomi! Wh-- What is it?

03:27.159 --> 03:29.535
They know what she is.
They're gonna cut her open.

03:29.619 --> 03:32.413
They're gonna turn her into a Bolger.
We gotta do something.

03:32.497 --> 03:33.832
Bu-- What?

03:33.915 --> 03:34.916
We need information.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.961
We need to know if BPO has been alerted,
if someone's made the diagnosis...

03:38.044 --> 03:40.797
I could hack into the hospital
in a second,

03:40.880 --> 03:43.216
but I don't have any equipment.
They took everything.

03:43.300 --> 03:46.219
Can't you... use your police codes
or something and call them?

03:46.303 --> 03:48.138
- Is that the cop?
- Yeah.

03:48.221 --> 03:49.597
I was suspended.

03:50.390 --> 03:51.850
- Great.
- What?

03:51.933 --> 03:53.977
- He got suspended.
- Great.

03:54.894 --> 03:56.396
[Nomi] What do we do?

03:56.479 --> 03:57.689
[knocking at door]

04:01.567 --> 04:03.153
I-- I wouldn't answer that.

04:03.862 --> 04:06.156
No one looking for a fugitive
would knock like that.

04:11.494 --> 04:13.913
[Neets breathes heavily, gasps]

04:16.249 --> 04:17.083
Bug!

04:18.168 --> 04:20.003
Hello, Angels.

04:21.504 --> 04:23.715
Bug, what are you doing here?

04:23.798 --> 04:25.633
Feds are funny, you know.

04:25.717 --> 04:29.929
They spend all that money
protecting things that nobody cares about.

04:30.013 --> 04:32.598
Then they leave
the real information lying around

04:32.682 --> 04:35.643
like a Post-it note on a refrigerator.

04:36.436 --> 04:41.024
For instance, when they confiscate
illegal electronic equipment,

04:41.107 --> 04:43.609
it's inventoried to a site...

04:43.693 --> 04:46.571
that's like a shopping list
to a guy like me.

04:48.740 --> 04:50.950
So-- Thank you, baby.

04:51.034 --> 04:56.039
So when I saw exactly the things
that I had just sold you posted,

04:56.122 --> 05:00.419
well... the Bug suspected foul play.

05:03.004 --> 05:06.799
Oh, I-- I don't have
any money to pay you, Bug.

05:07.550 --> 05:09.344
I didn't come for money.

05:10.553 --> 05:13.223
I'd still be in prison
if it weren't for you, Mike.

05:14.474 --> 05:16.435
I mean Nomi. Nomi.

05:17.977 --> 05:22.148
Look, I don't know what kind of fight
you're getting yourself into, but...

05:22.982 --> 05:29.114
I do know... you can't shoot back
without any bullets in your gun.

05:29.197 --> 05:30.407
So...

05:32.451 --> 05:36.413
consider yourselves... reloaded.

05:37.497 --> 05:39.040
Oh...

05:45.797 --> 05:47.340
Hey, partner. What's up?

05:47.424 --> 05:49.175
I thought we agreed
we'd be starting tomorrow.

05:49.259 --> 05:53.596
[sighs] We did, but, uh...
there's something I have to do,

05:53.679 --> 05:54.847
and I need a favor.

05:55.515 --> 05:56.516
Who's this?

05:59.936 --> 06:03.148
Hey, beautiful girl. I'm Jela.
What's your name?

06:03.231 --> 06:07.068
I'm Amondi Kabaka.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Jela.

06:11.239 --> 06:12.824
I was hoping she could stay here with you.

06:13.950 --> 06:17.203
I believe someone else
will come by later to collect her.

06:18.330 --> 06:19.580
Where will you be?

06:20.581 --> 06:22.167
If it gets too late...

06:24.043 --> 06:25.711
here is the number of her French teacher.

06:26.963 --> 06:29.048
She will know what to do.

06:29.132 --> 06:32.718
Capheus... where are you going?

06:33.470 --> 06:35.388
I have to settle a debt.

06:35.472 --> 06:38.850
- You're coming back, aren't you?
- [Capheus chuckles]

06:39.851 --> 06:42.521
Van Damme always comes back.

06:49.569 --> 06:50.945
Take care of her, Jela.

06:51.946 --> 06:53.072
I will.

06:59.745 --> 07:01.164
[Jela] Hey, Van Damme.

07:03.041 --> 07:04.459
See you tomorrow.

07:15.554 --> 07:18.639
[Rajan] The doctors are saying
it's a miracle he's still alive.

07:19.807 --> 07:21.767
I'm not sure which
would upset my father more:

07:21.851 --> 07:24.645
the idea of fanatics trying to kill him,

07:24.729 --> 07:27.148
or a god getting credit for saving him.

07:29.150 --> 07:30.485
How is your mother?

07:31.486 --> 07:37.617
As he improves, she becomes convinced...
that it's because she's praying again.

07:37.700 --> 07:39.285
She wants to go to the temple with you.

07:41.580 --> 07:45.708
Rajan? I know you
want to get back to the hospital...

07:47.502 --> 07:49.128
It's actually nice to get outside,

07:49.212 --> 07:50.046
so thank you.

07:50.129 --> 07:51.964
Though I am a little nervous about

07:52.048 --> 07:53.674
what you've been wanting to talk about.

07:57.053 --> 08:00.890
It's about... something I didn't
tell the police when they questioned me

08:00.973 --> 08:02.559
about the attack on your father.

08:03.560 --> 08:07.606
It had no bearing on what happened.
It was... a private matter.

08:08.314 --> 08:11.526
As such,
I felt that I should tell only you.

08:13.111 --> 08:15.405
Your father did not want us
to get married.

08:16.489 --> 08:19.659
He told me that he had reconsidered
and asked me to say no to you,

08:19.742 --> 08:21.411
for your own good.

08:21.494 --> 08:23.704
He thought that we were not well matched.

08:28.209 --> 08:30.044
What did you say?

08:30.128 --> 08:32.964
There was no time
to say very much of anything.

08:35.883 --> 08:39.095
How difficult it must have been
for you to hold all this inside.

08:39.929 --> 08:42.265
I thought it was important
for you to know.

08:43.849 --> 08:47.479
A lesser woman would have said
he wished us well,

08:47.562 --> 08:50.064
that he wanted us
to be married no matter what...

08:51.065 --> 08:52.858
and he gave us his blessings.

08:52.942 --> 08:54.944
And I would have known that she was lying.

08:56.154 --> 08:58.406
You knew he was against our marriage?

08:58.990 --> 09:00.199
Of course.

09:03.662 --> 09:05.830
So is that what I was to you?

09:05.913 --> 09:09.417
- An act of rebellion against your father?
- Never.

09:09.501 --> 09:11.419
I told you the truth.

09:11.503 --> 09:13.754
Maybe it added a bit of spice
to my attraction to you,

09:13.838 --> 09:16.591
but it has nothing to do
with why I asked you to marry me.

09:18.050 --> 09:21.596
I want you to marry me,
not to be for or against anyone else,

09:21.680 --> 09:24.765
because I love you,
I trust you...

09:24.849 --> 09:28.227
and I can imagine no better life
than growing old with you.

09:33.274 --> 09:34.859
All I need to know now is...

09:36.110 --> 09:40.281
after everything that has happened,
do you still want to marry me?

09:45.620 --> 09:47.622
[typing]

09:51.917 --> 09:56.172
[Nomi] OK, I fixed it so that
any information, requisition or test

09:56.255 --> 10:00.134
that goes out with her name on it
will look like spam to other computers.

10:00.218 --> 10:02.345
Great. So she's safe.

10:02.428 --> 10:05.306
I figure they would've moved her
somewhere more secure if they knew,

10:05.390 --> 10:07.225
like they did to me.

10:07.308 --> 10:10.687
- [sighs] Her poor father.
- Yeah.

10:10.770 --> 10:13.272
He's been there the whole time.

10:18.903 --> 10:21.656
[singing "Baba O'Riley"]

10:38.964 --> 10:40.299
How is she?

10:41.509 --> 10:45.680
She's still in the ICU...
but she's not alone.

12:34.121 --> 12:35.707
[singsong] Come on out.

12:38.543 --> 12:39.502
Eh?

12:39.585 --> 12:41.170
[chattering in Swahili]

12:41.253 --> 12:42.380
It's empty!

12:42.463 --> 12:44.382
Where is she?

12:44.465 --> 12:46.843
Amondi. Where the fuck is the girl?!

12:48.302 --> 12:49.721
She has nothing to do with this.

12:49.804 --> 12:51.681
[screams] Bullshit!

12:51.764 --> 12:53.808
She's Kabaka's daughter.

12:53.892 --> 12:55.560
[Capheus] She's just a child.

12:56.561 --> 12:59.021
He killed my sister.

12:59.104 --> 13:02.066
I'm here because
you have a quarrel with me,

13:02.149 --> 13:05.444
not my mother... and not a child.

13:07.112 --> 13:08.865
Let us settle our debt...

13:10.282 --> 13:11.325
like men.

[laughter]

13:56.537 --> 13:57.956
Like men!

14:05.337 --> 14:07.882
You are hilarious.

14:07.966 --> 14:09.174
I like you, Van Damme.

14:09.258 --> 14:10.635
Come!

- Walk!

14:50.257 --> 14:51.342
[guard] No touching!

15:02.895 --> 15:04.063
Sister...

15:06.691 --> 15:08.317
it's good to see you.

15:09.861 --> 15:11.821
What are you doing here, Joong-Ki?

15:15.700 --> 15:19.161
[sighs] There's no easy way to say this.

15:23.123 --> 15:25.459
Last night, Father was very upset.

15:25.543 --> 15:27.169
He was drinking.

15:27.252 --> 15:28.587
You know how he can be.

15:30.172 --> 15:32.341
I told him to go home.

15:32.424 --> 15:33.926
He said he couldn't.

15:34.593 --> 15:39.891
He said he was a failure, that he deserved
no home, that he deserved to die.

15:41.851 --> 15:44.062
I couldn't listen to him anymore.

15:44.144 --> 15:45.145
I left.

15:45.229 --> 15:48.858
I wish to God I hadn't, but I did.

15:51.402 --> 15:53.487
I have to live with that mistake.

15:59.118 --> 16:01.079
We had a meeting this morning.

16:01.161 --> 16:03.205
He never showed up.

16:03.288 --> 16:05.374
I had everyone looking for him.

16:06.876 --> 16:10.129
I had a lunch...
when the police showed up.

16:15.927 --> 16:17.302
They found him.

16:18.930 --> 16:20.598
He was in his car.

16:21.432 --> 16:24.435
A hose connected
the exhaust to the window.

16:26.938 --> 16:28.522
But the police are wrong.

16:30.315 --> 16:32.234
He didn't kill himself.

16:33.485 --> 16:35.821
It was shame.

16:35.905 --> 16:37.740
Like a kind of cancer.

16:39.199 --> 16:41.160
Shame killed our father.

16:44.329 --> 16:48.459
Sun... we cannot blame ourselves, OK?

16:49.501 --> 16:52.713
What happened was beyond our control.

16:53.547 --> 16:56.634
But I didn't want you
to hear it from someone else.

16:56.717 --> 16:58.970
That's why I had to come myself.

17:04.934 --> 17:06.644
[breath quivering]

17:06.727 --> 17:08.646
I'm so sorry.

17:19.615 --> 17:23.911
At least... we still have each other.

17:50.146 --> 17:51.522
You killed him.

17:53.565 --> 17:56.777
You... killed him.

18:00.739 --> 18:05.244
[sniffles]
Sun... I know this is a terrible blow.

18:05.327 --> 18:08.455
He was going
to tell the truth to the court,

18:08.539 --> 18:13.293
so you had to stop him,
because you're afraid of prison.

18:20.843 --> 18:22.427
[sniffs]

18:22.511 --> 18:23.721
Sun...

18:24.972 --> 18:27.808
do not say something
you're going to regret.

18:29.935 --> 18:32.271
The police said it was a suicide.

18:32.354 --> 18:36.275
You murdered... our father.

18:45.617 --> 18:47.661
[whispers] I was nowhere near him.

18:53.918 --> 18:55.335
[sniffs] OK...

18:56.254 --> 18:57.713
obviously, you're upset.

to house-train her, but...

20:14.206 --> 20:18.169
See... I was going
to make this bitch watch me

20:18.252 --> 20:21.797
as I killed the only thing
in her life that mattered.

20:22.714 --> 20:25.217

and put this bitch out of her misery.

20:47.281 --> 20:48.407
You do it.

21:10.388 --> 21:16.143
You cut her fucking head off...
and we'll call our debt even.

21:18.354 --> 21:19.730
It's a little dull.

21:19.813 --> 21:24.609
You might have to hack a few times...
but you can do it.

21:24.693 --> 21:28.280
You are Van-fucking-Damme.
[chuckles]

21:31.491 --> 21:33.160
[whispers] Do it quick!

21:41.126 --> 21:45.339
Come on, Van Damme.
Like a man, huh?

21:46.173 --> 21:47.841
Like a man!

22:03.607 --> 22:05.484
[Silas sobbing]

22:06.360 --> 22:07.652
What's the problem?

22:09.321 --> 22:11.282
I'll tell you the problem.

22:12.241 --> 22:16.703
The problem is... you aren't a man.

22:16.787 --> 22:19.123
You're just another bitch!

22:24.253 --> 22:26.880
[Silas whimpering]

22:26.964 --> 22:28.882
Bitch, come on!

22:28.966 --> 22:30.592
[grunting]

22:35.139 --> 22:37.141
It's you or him, bitch!

22:44.273 --> 22:46.942
[softly] Call me a bitch one more time...

22:48.026 --> 22:49.569
and I will kill you.

22:49.653 --> 22:50.946
Say what?

22:52.072 --> 22:53.282
Bitch!

22:58.745 --> 23:00.789
- [screams]
- [Sun shouts]

23:00.872 --> 23:03.417
[man screams]

23:04.251 --> 23:05.669
- [Sun] Aah!
- [man shouts]

23:15.846 --> 23:18.474
[grunting] Aah!

23:21.018 --> 23:22.102
[chuckles]

23:25.147 --> 23:26.231
[Sun shouts]

23:33.531 --> 23:34.698
[screams]

23:48.879 --> 23:50.172
[screams]

24:11.943 --> 24:13.487
Van Damme.

24:14.405 --> 24:16.823
Fucking Van Damme.

24:18.992 --> 24:20.202
[sighs]

24:23.330 --> 24:24.706
[engine revving]

25:09.000 --> 25:10.252
What the fuck are you doing here?

25:12.087 --> 25:13.838
[groans]

25:22.847 --> 25:24.933
[screams] Find them!

25:49.958 --> 25:52.127
[Wolfgang] "What's best in life?

25:52.210 --> 25:54.421
Crush your enemies,

25:54.505 --> 25:56.756
see them driven before you,

25:56.840 --> 25:59.384
and hear the lamentations
of their women."

26:15.859 --> 26:17.110
Thank you.

26:18.696 --> 26:22.240
- Thank you.
- No... it's we who should thank you.

26:22.324 --> 26:25.577
- This means so much.
- Yes, so much.

26:26.495 --> 26:28.664
Remover of obstacles.

26:28.747 --> 26:31.500
As the obstacle to our faith was removed.

26:31.583 --> 26:35.337
- What are you... talking--
- She is our hero.

26:35.420 --> 26:37.797
She brought him here.

26:38.507 --> 26:41.510
- No.
- Yes. God worked through you.

26:41.593 --> 26:45.055
- No!
- Yes. You brought the defiler to us.

26:45.138 --> 26:46.931
You brought him
where we could reach him at last.

26:47.015 --> 26:49.351
No one likes violence.

26:49.434 --> 26:51.186
God does not like violence.

26:51.269 --> 26:52.688
This is obscene!

26:52.771 --> 26:56.692
But he knows...
sometimes it is necessary--

26:56.775 --> 26:58.860
No, don't touch me.

26:58.943 --> 27:01.029
You have nothing to be afraid of.

27:01.112 --> 27:02.822
- You are one of us.
- [man] Yes.

27:02.906 --> 27:03.907
- [woman] Yes.
- No!

27:03.990 --> 27:05.492
[man] You're one of us!

27:06.702 --> 27:08.119
Don't touch her!

27:09.954 --> 27:14.752
If I see you... any of you, here again,

27:14.834 --> 27:16.795
I will show you what violence looks like.

27:20.465 --> 27:22.676
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Come on, come on!

27:22.760 --> 27:24.052
Let's go.

27:25.596 --> 27:26.888
Thank you.

27:26.971 --> 27:28.807
They'll be back.

27:28.932 --> 27:31.560
- So will I.
- Well...

27:32.269 --> 27:33.520
so will I.

27:35.647 --> 27:37.733
This is India. Wow.

27:38.358 --> 27:40.318
Uh, where are you?

27:41.236 --> 27:43.947
Chicago... sort of.

27:44.030 --> 27:45.407
Sort of?

27:46.199 --> 27:47.867
My thoughts aren't really there.

27:50.287 --> 27:51.663
They're with her.

27:52.956 --> 27:55.375
[softly] I remember listening to music.

27:55.459 --> 27:57.419
Yeah, her father
was playing with the orchestra,

27:57.502 --> 27:58.837
and it triggered something in her.

28:00.213 --> 28:02.424
- What is wrong with her?
- I'm not sure.

28:02.507 --> 28:05.302
I'm afraid that soon
they'll realize what she is.

28:05.385 --> 28:07.011
And then?

28:07.929 --> 28:09.180
I don't know.

28:22.068 --> 28:23.987
- Are we clear?
- I don't know.

28:26.239 --> 28:30.410
Van Damme-- Capheus, thank you.

28:30.494 --> 28:32.454
Thank you for not giving them Amondi.

28:32.537 --> 28:34.205
I'm going to make you a rich man.

28:34.289 --> 28:36.541
I don't want your money, sir.
You can keep it.

28:36.625 --> 28:39.503
Tell me then, why did you save me?

28:40.253 --> 28:42.840
To be honest,
it wasn't exactly a part of my plan.

28:45.967 --> 28:47.552
Oh, no!

29:18.583 --> 29:20.585
Any weapons in here? Knives, guns?

29:20.669 --> 29:22.713
No, no, I don't have any weapons.

29:31.179 --> 29:33.807
- Capheus!
- [Will] What is it? What's the matter?

29:33.891 --> 29:35.266
I think I'm about to die.

29:36.518 --> 29:38.019
Nobody's gonna die.

29:40.856 --> 29:41.690
[grunts]

29:51.575 --> 29:52.743
Buckle up!

29:56.872 --> 29:58.790
- [screams]
- [man shouting]

30:18.810 --> 30:20.896
Move, move, move, move. Move!

30:21.772 --> 30:23.523
- Fuck!
- [man shouts in Swahili]

30:27.318 --> 30:29.613
[horns honking]

30:30.989 --> 30:32.365
Move, move, move!

30:34.868 --> 30:35.702
Sorry!

30:35.786 --> 30:37.245
[engine revving]

30:41.040 --> 30:42.459
[whispers] Shit!

30:44.795 --> 30:46.337
[tires squealing]

31:01.979 --> 31:03.438
[motorcycle approaching]

31:05.983 --> 31:07.358
Oh, shit!

31:25.669 --> 31:27.004
- [gun clicking]
- Shit!

31:40.892 --> 31:42.727
[engine revving]

31:50.568 --> 31:51.903
Is he gone?

32:16.053 --> 32:17.721
Let's settle this.

32:40.243 --> 32:41.953
[revving]

33:00.304 --> 33:01.347
[screams]

33:01.431 --> 33:02.390
[gunshot]

33:06.686 --> 33:08.813
[screaming]

33:16.071 --> 33:17.155
Aah!

33:42.555 --> 33:45.475
You will take good care of him,
you understand?

33:46.517 --> 33:48.979
If anyone comes looking
for a man matching his description,

33:49.062 --> 33:51.982
you say nothing, you do nothing,
you call me.

33:53.524 --> 33:54.692
How long will it be?

33:56.277 --> 33:59.197
What I have to do now...
shouldn't take long.

34:01.825 --> 34:03.284
What name should I use?

34:07.455 --> 34:09.082
Conan.

34:09.166 --> 34:10.583
Is that a first name, a last name?

34:13.336 --> 34:14.462
Yes.

34:41.990 --> 34:44.159
[indistinct chatter]

34:46.077 --> 34:47.120
Try it.

34:54.085 --> 34:55.461
Nice.

34:58.297 --> 34:59.298
Capheus!

35:01.259 --> 35:02.468
Capheus...

35:03.553 --> 35:06.931
Ah! Capheus!

35:07.015 --> 35:08.558
Oh, my God!

35:12.187 --> 35:13.312
I knew you'd come back.

35:14.231 --> 35:16.315
Van Damme always comes back.

35:17.400 --> 35:19.986
Papa, are you all right?

35:20.070 --> 35:22.906
I'm fine.
No, I'm better than fine.

35:24.115 --> 35:25.366
I'm lucky.

35:28.995 --> 35:31.206
- Who loves you?
- You do.

35:45.095 --> 35:47.764
- [heart monitor beeps steadily]
- [exhales]

35:49.015 --> 35:51.184
[wind howling]

35:51.268 --> 35:52.643
[sharp inhale]

35:58.233 --> 36:00.068
[woman] I've never seen anything like it.

36:00.151 --> 36:02.361
The growth of the substantia alba.

36:02.445 --> 36:04.864
[exhales] I'm so cold.

36:04.948 --> 36:07.284
[Magnus] Here, take my coat.

36:07.366 --> 36:08.285
No.

36:13.706 --> 36:14.958
- No!
- [monitor beeps rapidly]

36:15.041 --> 36:17.376
I can't believe she can even move
with what we've given her.

36:18.502 --> 36:20.546
Kids today have
huge tolerance for drugs.

36:23.133 --> 36:24.550
[heart monitor stabilizes]

36:24.634 --> 36:28.346
- Did we hear back from the neurologist?
- Not yet. Still waiting.

36:30.140 --> 36:31.682
Did you do that?

36:32.475 --> 36:35.270
It was easy.
Hacking's what I do.

36:36.437 --> 36:37.355
Did you do this, too?

36:39.941 --> 36:42.986
How'd you get access
to the Australian fugitive alert?

36:43.736 --> 36:45.780
I'm an all-access kind of girl.

36:47.949 --> 36:49.993
Looks totally real, doesn't it?

36:50.076 --> 36:52.578
I figured it would
buy us a little more time.

36:52.662 --> 36:53.997
That's the question.

36:54.080 --> 36:56.040
How much time do we have,
how much time does she have?

36:56.124 --> 36:58.376
None. You're out of time.

36:58.459 --> 36:59.794
Jonas.

36:59.877 --> 37:01.296
I told you I made a mistake.

37:01.379 --> 37:03.422
I wish there was some way to fix it,
but there's not.

37:04.757 --> 37:08.094
I was just afraid if I didn't help you,
you wouldn't be alive right now.

37:08.178 --> 37:10.013
That's not a mistake, that's true.

37:10.096 --> 37:12.890
No, the mistake was mine.
I should've trusted you.

37:12.974 --> 37:15.726
The real question we face is,
can you trust me now?

37:15.810 --> 37:17.103
Yes.

37:17.187 --> 37:19.814
Even when I tell you
that Whispers knows about Riley?

37:20.815 --> 37:23.276
How? I have all the information
locked down.

37:23.360 --> 37:25.695
You know about her
and Will knows about her...

37:26.737 --> 37:28.198
and I know you.

37:29.782 --> 37:33.244
And Whispers... knows me.

37:34.120 --> 37:35.788
Be careful what you tell them.

37:35.872 --> 37:38.291
Not too much, or they won't believe you.

37:40.335 --> 37:41.919
He's here with me now.

37:43.004 --> 37:45.048
He wants me to tell you
that he's going to Iceland,

37:45.131 --> 37:46.883
that he's going to find Riley,

37:46.966 --> 37:49.802
and once he does, it won't be long
until he finds the rest of you.

37:49.886 --> 37:52.680
And why would he tell us that?
Why not just go straight to Iceland

37:52.763 --> 37:54.265
or have Riley arrested?

37:54.349 --> 37:57.060
Tell Will I look forward to meeting him.

37:59.937 --> 38:02.065
Don't underestimate him, Will.

38:02.148 --> 38:04.692
He's very good at manipulating people.

38:04.775 --> 38:08.363
Right now he's smiling because
he knows the only thought in your head

38:08.446 --> 38:10.823
is getting on the next plane to Iceland.

38:34.222 --> 38:35.681
This is a bad place.

38:37.058 --> 38:38.809
You should not be here.

38:43.273 --> 38:44.857
You don't have to do this.

38:46.025 --> 38:48.403
You could just... turn around.

38:48.486 --> 38:50.905
It is so simple a thing, just...

38:50.988 --> 38:54.533
just turn the wheel,
and the future changes.

38:54.617 --> 38:57.245
- It is not that simple.
- It is.

38:57.328 --> 38:59.538
You stopped your wedding,
but it's still going to happen.

39:02.375 --> 39:04.001
You don't know that.

39:06.504 --> 39:09.673
Some things in our lives are inevitable.

39:11.134 --> 39:12.969
Don't do this.

39:13.052 --> 39:15.346
They will kill you.

39:15.430 --> 39:17.307
There are worse things than dying.

39:20.268 --> 39:21.852
Wolfgang, please!

39:24.147 --> 39:26.899
There are things I will never be able
to understand about your world,

39:26.983 --> 39:29.819
just as there are things
you will never understand about mine.

39:34.282 --> 39:36.575
I understand how I feel about you.

39:38.661 --> 39:42.915
And somehow, I know
that you feel the same way about me.

39:45.335 --> 39:47.170
This is why I'm here.

39:53.968 --> 39:55.845
After what I did...

39:58.597 --> 40:00.850
as long as that man is alive...

40:02.893 --> 40:05.563
no one I care about will ever be safe.

40:40.014 --> 40:41.098
[console beeps]

40:42.725 --> 40:43.726
It's Wolfgang.

41:11.212 --> 41:13.089
[Sun] Crying won't help him.

41:17.927 --> 41:19.929
I can feel what you're feeling.

41:22.348 --> 41:24.392
This is what life is.

41:25.684 --> 41:30.607
Fear, rage, desire... love.

41:34.985 --> 41:39.115
To stop feeling emotions,
to stop wanting to feel them...

41:39.907 --> 41:43.119
is to feel... death.

41:44.328 --> 41:46.623
What do you suggest I do?

41:48.124 --> 41:51.210
I take everything I am feeling...

41:52.420 --> 41:55.256
everything that matters to me...

41:57.592 --> 42:02.846
I push all of it... into my fist...

42:06.809 --> 42:08.561
and I fight for it.
