01:04.772 --> 01:07.617
<i>My dear Frodo:</i>

01:13.115 --> 01:14.617
<i>You asked me once...</i>

01:14.741 --> 01:19.497
<i>...if I had told you everything
there was to know about my adventures.</i>

01:19.621 --> 01:23.421
<i>And while I can honestly say
I have told you the truth...</i>

01:24.626 --> 01:26.924
<i>...I may not have told you all of it.</i>

01:34.970 --> 01:37.018
<i>I am old now, Frodo.</i>

01:38.473 --> 01:41.272
<i>I'm not the same Hobbit I once was.</i>

01:44.563 --> 01:49.069
<i>I think it is time for you to know...</i>

01:49.234 --> 01:51.908
<i>...what really happened.</i>

01:53.447 --> 01:56.872
<i>It began long ago...</i>

01:57.993 --> 02:01.167
<i>...in a land far away to the east...</i>

02:01.330 --> 02:06.336
<i>...the like of which you will not find
in the world today.</i>

02:16.303 --> 02:18.897
<i>There was the city of Dale.</i>

02:19.056 --> 02:21.479
<i>Its markets known far and wide.</i>

02:21.642 --> 02:24.987
<i>Full of the bounties of vine and vale.</i>

02:25.145 --> 02:28.649
<i>Peaceful and prosperous.</i>

02:30.984 --> 02:36.787
<i>For this city lay before the doors
of the greatest kingdom in Middle-earth:</i>

02:37.449 --> 02:38.541
<i>Erebor.</i>

02:39.826 --> 02:44.047
<i>Stronghold of Thror,
King Under the Mountain.</i>

02:44.206 --> 02:47.005
<i>Mightiest of the Dwarf Lords.</i>

02:48.085 --> 02:50.804
<i>Thror ruled with utter surety...</i>

02:50.962 --> 02:53.385
<i>...never doubting his house would endure...</i>

02:53.548 --> 02:57.644
<i>...for his line lay secure
in the lives of his son...</i>

02:57.803 --> 02:59.680
<i>...and grandson.</i>

03:00.806 --> 03:04.106
<i>Ah, Frodo. Erebor.</i>

03:04.226 --> 03:06.570
<i>Built deep within the mountain itself...</i>

03:06.728 --> 03:10.403
<i>...the beauty of this
fortress city was legend.</i>

03:10.565 --> 03:12.988
<i>Its wealth lay in the earth...</i>

03:13.360 --> 03:15.909
<i>...in precious gems hewn from rock...</i>

03:16.071 --> 03:18.415
<i>...and in great seams of gold...</i>

03:18.573 --> 03:21.668
<i>...running like rivers through stone.</i>

03:24.329 --> 03:27.708
<i>The skill of the Dwarves was unequaled...</i>

03:27.916 --> 03:31.090
<i>...fashioning objects of great beauty...</i>

03:31.253 --> 03:35.508
<i>...out of diamond, emerald,
ruby and sapphire.</i>

03:36.299 --> 03:40.099
<i>Ever they delved deeper,
down into the dark.</i>

03:40.846 --> 03:43.349
<i>And that is where they found it.</i>

03:49.730 --> 03:51.732
<i>The Heart of the Mountain.</i>

03:53.650 --> 03:55.652
<i>The Arkenstone.</i>

03:56.528 --> 03:59.327
<i>Thror named it "The King's Jewel."</i>

03:59.531 --> 04:04.332
<i>He took it as a sign,
a sign that his right to rule was divine.</i>

04:04.703 --> 04:07.081
<i>All would pay homage to him.</i>

04:07.247 --> 04:11.627
<i>Even the great Elven King, Thranduil.</i>

04:12.753 --> 04:16.882
<i>But the years of peace and plenty
were not to last.</i>

04:17.798 --> 04:21.099
<i>Slowly the days turned sour...</i>

04:21.470 --> 04:23.848
<i>...and the watchful nights closed in.</i>

04:31.271 --> 04:35.697
<i>Thror's love of gold had grown too fierce.</i>

04:37.152 --> 04:41.077
<i>A sickness had begun to grow within him.</i>

04:41.990 --> 04:44.618
<i>It was a sickness of the mind.</i>

04:47.370 --> 04:50.214
<i>And where sickness thrives...</i>

04:50.916 --> 04:53.669
<i>...bad things will follow.</i>

05:02.219 --> 05:05.314
<i>The first they heard
was a noise like a hurricane...</i>

05:05.514 --> 05:07.687
<i>...coming down from the North.</i>

05:07.849 --> 05:13.026
<i>The pines on the mountain
creaked and cracked in the hot, dry wind.</i>

05:17.192 --> 05:20.071
Balin, sound the alarm.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.366
Call out the guard. Do it now!

05:24.533 --> 05:25.830
What is it?

05:25.992 --> 05:27.619
Dragon.

05:28.203 --> 05:31.127
Dragon!

05:32.624 --> 05:34.626
<i>He was a firedrake from the North.</i>

05:42.884 --> 05:46.229
<i>Smaug had come.</i>

06:13.915 --> 06:16.885
<i>Such wanton death was dealt that day.</i>

06:17.919 --> 06:21.389
<i>For this city of Men was nothing to Smaug.</i>

06:22.007 --> 06:25.762
<i>His eye was set on another prize.</i>

06:30.181 --> 06:36.154
<i>For dragons covet gold
with a dark and fierce desire.</i>

07:04.424 --> 07:05.425
Aah!

07:08.219 --> 07:10.313
No!

07:15.727 --> 07:17.070
Come on.

07:18.396 --> 07:20.945
<i>Erebor was lost.</i>

07:25.904 --> 07:28.498
<i>For a dragon will guard his plunder...</i>

07:28.657 --> 07:31.001
<i>...as long as he lives.</i>

07:40.085 --> 07:41.837
Run for your lives!

07:42.045 --> 07:44.719
Ah! Help us!

07:57.227 --> 08:02.199
<i>Thranduil would not risk the lives of his
kin against the wrath of the dragon.</i>

08:02.983 --> 08:06.533
<i>No help came from the Elves that day...</i>

08:06.820 --> 08:08.242
<i>...nor any day since.</i>

08:10.740 --> 08:12.993
<i>Robbed of their homeland...</i>

08:13.159 --> 08:16.538
<i>- -the Dwarves of Erebor
wandered the wilderness...</i>

08:16.663 --> 08:20.008
<i>...a once mighty people brought low.</i>

08:22.335 --> 08:25.805
<i>The young Dwarf prince took work
where he could find it...</i>

08:25.964 --> 08:28.308
<i>...laboring in the villages of Men.</i>

08:28.466 --> 08:31.015
<i>But always he remembered...</i>

08:31.177 --> 08:33.645
<i>...the mountain smoke beneath the moon...</i>

08:33.804 --> 08:37.058
<i>...the trees like torches blazing bright.</i>

08:37.183 --> 08:40.562
<i>For he had seen dragon fire in the sky...</i>

08:40.729 --> 08:43.198
<i>...and a city turned to ash.</i>

08:45.150 --> 08:47.278
<i>And he never forgave...</i>

08:47.694 --> 08:49.571
<i>...and he never forgot.</i>

08:55.243 --> 08:59.544
<i>That, my dear Frodo, is where I come in.</i>

08:59.664 --> 09:02.588
<i>For, quite by chance,
and the will of a Wizard...</i>

09:02.792 --> 09:07.548
<i>...fate decided I would become
part of this tale.</i>

09:08.339 --> 09:09.807
<i>It began...</i>

09:09.966 --> 09:12.219
<i>Well, it began as you might expect.</i>

09:13.970 --> 09:16.064
<i>In a hole in the ground...</i>

09:16.222 --> 09:18.771
<i>...there lived a Hobbit.</i>

09:20.602 --> 09:26.109
<i>Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole
full of worms and oozy smells.</i>

09:26.316 --> 09:28.444
<i>This was a Hobbit hole.</i>

09:28.651 --> 09:33.908
<i>And that means good food, a warm hearth...</i>

09:34.407 --> 09:37.126
<i>...and all the comforts of home.</i>

10:11.611 --> 10:13.454
Thank you.

10:14.322 --> 10:15.744
What's this?

10:15.907 --> 10:18.786
That is private. Keep your sticky paws off.

10:20.411 --> 10:22.413
It's not ready yet.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.127
Not ready for what?

10:24.290 --> 10:25.337
Reading.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.473
What on earth are these?

10:32.006 --> 10:33.567
Replies to the party invitations.

10:34.050 --> 10:38.476
Ah. Good gracious. Is it today?

10:38.638 --> 10:40.015
They all say they're coming.

10:40.140 --> 10:44.020
Except for the Sackville-Bagginses,
who are demanding you ask them in person.

10:44.144 --> 10:47.318
Are they, indeed? Over my dead body.

10:47.480 --> 10:51.201
They'd probably find that quite agreeable.
They seem to think you have tunnels...

10:51.401 --> 10:55.998
- ...overflowing with gold.
- It was one small chest, hardly overflowing.

10:56.781 --> 10:58.783
And it still smells of Troll.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.835
What on earth are you doing?

11:04.080 --> 11:06.048
Taking precautions.

11:06.332 --> 11:09.051
You know, I caught her making off
with the silverware once.

11:09.210 --> 11:13.135
- Who?
- Lobelia Sackville-Baggins.

11:13.506 --> 11:17.010
She had all my spoons
stuffed in her pocket. Ha!

11:17.177 --> 11:18.349
Dreadful woman.

11:18.553 --> 11:22.057
Make sure you keep an eye on her
after I'm...

11:23.016 --> 11:25.519
When I'm... When I'm...

11:25.727 --> 11:28.025
When you're what?

11:31.649 --> 11:34.994
It's nothing. Nothing.

11:39.616 --> 11:42.711
You know, some people are beginning
to wonder about you, Uncle.

11:42.911 --> 11:45.585
- Huh?
- They think you're becoming odd.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.299
Odd? Oh. Hm.

11:48.499 --> 11:49.751
Unsociable.

11:49.959 --> 11:52.883
Unsociable, me? Nonsense.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.515
Be a good lad and put that on the gate.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.728
- Do you think he'll come?
- Who?

12:08.186 --> 12:09.187
Gandalf.

12:09.395 --> 12:12.820
Oh-ho. He wouldn't miss a chance
to let off his Whizpoppers.

12:12.982 --> 12:15.076
He'll give us quite a show, you'll see.

12:15.276 --> 12:17.404
- Right, then. I'm off.
- Off to where?

12:17.570 --> 12:19.743
East-farthing Woods.
I'm going to surprise him.

12:19.906 --> 12:24.207
Well, go on, then.
You don't want to be late.

12:27.872 --> 12:31.547
<i>He doesn't approve of being late. Oh, no.</i>

12:31.709 --> 12:33.962
<i>Not that I ever was.</i>

12:34.128 --> 12:37.098
<i>In those days, I was always on time.</i>

12:37.799 --> 12:40.643
<i>I was entirely respectable.</i>

12:41.886 --> 12:44.514
<i>And nothing unexpected...</i>

12:46.099 --> 12:48.101
<i>...ever happened.</i>

13:12.000 --> 13:14.344
- Good morning.
- What do you mean?

13:14.794 --> 13:16.421
Do you wish me a good morning...

13:16.629 --> 13:19.883
...or do you mean that it is a good morning
whether I want it or not?

13:20.550 --> 13:25.147
Or perhaps you mean to say that you
feel good on this particular morning?

13:25.805 --> 13:29.776
Or are you simply stating
that this is a morning to be good on? Hm?

13:31.144 --> 13:33.146
All of them at once, I suppose.

13:34.397 --> 13:35.899
Hmm.

13:39.944 --> 13:40.991
Can I help you?

13:41.279 --> 13:44.283
That remains to be seen.

13:45.199 --> 13:49.420
I'm looking for someone
to share in an adventure.

13:52.540 --> 13:54.258
An adventure?

13:55.960 --> 14:01.638
No, I don't imagine anyone west of Bree
would have much interest in adventures.

14:01.799 --> 14:05.895
Nasty, disturbing, uncomfortable things.

14:06.637 --> 14:09.015
Make you late for dinner. Heh, heh.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.776
Mm. Huh.

14:12.310 --> 14:13.937
Hmm.

14:14.937 --> 14:17.065
Oh. Ah.

14:17.231 --> 14:18.403
Good morning.

14:18.649 --> 14:21.528
To think that I should have lived
to be "good morninged"...

14:21.694 --> 14:26.700
...by Belladonna Took's son
as if I were selling buttons at the door.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.368
Beg Your pardon?

14:28.534 --> 14:32.209
You've changed, and not entirely
for the better, Bilbo Baggins.

14:32.372 --> 14:33.544
I'm sorry, do I know you?

14:33.706 --> 14:36.755
Well, you know my name,
although you don't remember I belong to it.

14:36.959 --> 14:38.552
I'm Gandalf.

14:38.753 --> 14:40.926
And Gandalf means...

14:42.965 --> 14:44.308
...me.

14:44.675 --> 14:46.677
Gandalf?
Not Gandalf the wandering Wizard...

14:46.844 --> 14:48.892
...who made such excellent fireworks?

14:49.055 --> 14:52.901
Old Took used to have them on
Midsummer's Eve. Heh, heh. Ahem.

14:53.434 --> 14:55.186
No idea you were still in business.

14:56.270 --> 14:57.817
And where else should I be?

14:57.980 --> 15:00.733
Where else...? Ahem.

15:02.735 --> 15:06.456
Well, I'm pleased to find you remember
something about me...

15:06.739 --> 15:09.618
...even if it's only my fireworks.

15:10.284 --> 15:12.753
Yes. Well, that's decided.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.710
It'll be very good for you...

15:16.332 --> 15:17.959
...and most amusing for me.

15:18.126 --> 15:19.753
I shall inform the others.

15:19.961 --> 15:23.261
Inform the who? What?
No. No. No... Wait.

15:23.423 --> 15:28.930
We do not want any adventures here,
thank you. Not today. Not...

15:29.095 --> 15:32.895
I suggest you try Over the Hill
or Across the Water.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.687
Good morning.

17:00.520 --> 17:03.820
Dwalin, at your service.

17:04.065 --> 17:06.739
Hm. Uh...

17:07.026 --> 17:10.872
Bilbo Baggins, at yours.

17:11.739 --> 17:13.082
Do we know each other?

17:14.157 --> 17:15.454
No.

17:16.536 --> 17:19.415
Which way, laddie?
Is it down here?

17:19.579 --> 17:21.924
Is what down where?

17:22.124 --> 17:23.171
Supper.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.503
He said there'd be food and lots of it.

17:26.712 --> 17:29.886
He... He said? Who said?

17:32.051 --> 17:33.519
Mmm.

17:37.932 --> 17:39.354
Mmm.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.530
Very good, this. Any more?

17:43.980 --> 17:47.735
What? Oh, yes, yes. Ah.

17:53.447 --> 17:55.074
Help yourself.

17:57.868 --> 18:03.216
Hmm. It's just that, um,
I wasn't expecting company.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.634
That'll be the door.

18:12.758 --> 18:15.853
Balin, at your service.

18:16.637 --> 18:19.607
- Good evening.
- Yes. Yes, it is.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.568
- Though I think it might rain later.
- Hm?

18:22.727 --> 18:23.944
Am I late?

18:24.562 --> 18:26.280
Late for what?

18:26.897 --> 18:29.525
Oh! Ha, ha!

18:29.775 --> 18:31.448
Evening, brother.

18:32.820 --> 18:34.914
By my beard...

18:35.072 --> 18:38.076
...you're shorter and
wider than last we met.

18:38.242 --> 18:39.869
Wider, not shorter.

18:40.494 --> 18:42.963
Sharp enough for both of us.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.843
Uh, excuse me? Sorry, I hate to interrupt.

18:55.009 --> 18:59.139
But the thing is, I'm not entirely sure
you're in the right house.

18:59.305 --> 19:00.306
Have you eaten?

19:00.514 --> 19:05.486
It's not that I don't like visitors.
I like visitors as much as the next Hobbit.

19:05.645 --> 19:09.195
But I do like to know them
before they come visiting.

19:09.398 --> 19:10.741
- What is this?
- I don't know.

19:10.900 --> 19:13.824
- I think it's cheese. Gone blue.
- It's riddled with mold.

19:13.944 --> 19:18.666
The thing is, I don't know either of you.
Not in the slightest.

19:18.824 --> 19:21.668
I don't mean to be blunt,
but I had to speak my mind.

19:21.869 --> 19:23.837
- I'm sorry.
- You think...?

19:26.707 --> 19:28.084
Apology accepted.

19:28.250 --> 19:30.548
- Ah.
- Now, fill it up, brother, don't stint.

19:31.962 --> 19:35.341
- You wanna get stuck in?
- I could eat again if you insist, brother.

19:37.218 --> 19:39.095
- Fili.
- And Kili.

19:39.220 --> 19:41.097
At your service.

19:41.222 --> 19:43.566
- You must be Mr. Boggins.
- Nope! You can't come in.

19:43.766 --> 19:46.144
- You've come to the wrong house.
- What?

19:46.310 --> 19:48.563
- Has it been canceled?
- No one told us.

19:49.146 --> 19:51.569
- No, nothing's been canceled.
- That's a relief.

19:55.861 --> 19:59.616
Careful with these.
I just had them sharpened.

19:59.740 --> 20:01.617
- It's nice, this place.
- Yeah.

20:01.742 --> 20:04.996
- Did you do it yourself?
- What? No, it's been in the family for years.

20:05.162 --> 20:08.041
That's my mother's glory box.
Can you please not do that?

20:08.207 --> 20:10.835
Fili, Kili. Come on, give us a hand.

20:11.001 --> 20:13.379
Mr. Dwalin. Ha, ha.

20:14.130 --> 20:17.134
Shove this in the hallway.
Otherwise we'll never get everyone in.

20:17.299 --> 20:19.017
"Everyone"? How many more are there?

20:19.218 --> 20:21.220
- Where do you want this?
- Oh, no.

20:21.387 --> 20:25.108
- It's really heavy.
- No. No. There's nobody home!

20:25.224 --> 20:28.068
Go away and bother somebody else.

20:28.185 --> 20:31.405
There's far too many Dwarves
in my dining room as it is.

20:31.564 --> 20:35.535
If this is some clot-head's
idea of a joke...

20:35.735 --> 20:39.205
...I can only say it is in very poor taste.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.584
Get off, you big lump!

20:49.206 --> 20:50.503
Gandalf.

20:50.791 --> 20:54.967
Those are my pri...! Excuse me, not my wine.
Put that back. Put that back.

20:55.129 --> 20:57.223
Not the jam, please.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

20:57.381 --> 21:00.134
It's a tad excessive, isn't it?
Have you got a cheese knife?

21:00.301 --> 21:03.271
- "Cheese knife"? He eats it by the block.
- Ugh.

21:03.429 --> 21:06.774
No, that's Grandpa Mungo's chair...
No, so is that. Take it back, please.

21:06.932 --> 21:10.778
- I cannot hear what you're saying. BILBO:
- It's an antique. Not for sitting on.

21:11.312 --> 21:16.694
That is a book, not a coaster.
And put that map down.

21:16.859 --> 21:18.907
- Excuse me, Mr. Gandalf?
- Yes?

21:19.069 --> 21:21.743
May I tempt you with a cup of chamomile?

21:21.906 --> 21:26.753
Oh, no, thank you, Dori.
A little red wine for me, I think.

21:29.163 --> 21:32.292
- Whoop! Mind out.
- Yes. Ah.

21:34.084 --> 21:37.008
Uh, Fili, Kili. Uh...

21:37.171 --> 21:39.265
Oin, Gloin.

21:39.423 --> 21:42.427
Dwalin, Balin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur...

21:42.593 --> 21:45.221
- ...Dori, Nori. Ori!
- No. Not my prizewinners, thank you.

21:45.346 --> 21:47.019
No, thank you.

21:50.142 --> 21:52.691
Yes, you're quite right, Bifur.

21:52.853 --> 21:55.151
We appear to be one Dwarf short.

21:55.314 --> 22:00.787
He is late, is all. He traveled north
to a meeting of our kin. He will come.

22:00.945 --> 22:04.700
Mr. Gandalf? A little glass of red wine,
as requested.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.872
It's got a fruity bouquet.

22:07.076 --> 22:09.374
Oh. Cheers.

22:09.537 --> 22:13.383
Bombur's on his second leg of lamb already.

22:14.083 --> 22:15.130
Hmm.

22:16.502 --> 22:19.051
No chance. Not from that distance.

22:19.213 --> 22:20.385
Wanna bet?

22:20.506 --> 22:22.053
Bombur, catch!

22:25.594 --> 22:27.312
I'll help you with that.

22:34.395 --> 22:36.397
Oh, you great galumphing git!

22:36.647 --> 22:39.696
- Who wants an ale? There you go.
- Over here, brother.

22:39.859 --> 22:43.033
I said have another drink. Here you go.

22:48.158 --> 22:49.535
Ale on the count of three!

22:49.702 --> 22:51.124
One, two...

22:51.287 --> 22:52.334
Up!

23:03.549 --> 23:05.051
I knew you had it in you!

23:05.217 --> 23:07.936
Excuse me, that is a
doily, not a dishcloth.

23:08.095 --> 23:09.142
But it's full of holes.

23:09.263 --> 23:11.436
It's supposed to look like that.
It's crochet.

23:11.640 --> 23:14.564
And a wonderful game it is too,
if you've got the balls for it.

23:14.727 --> 23:16.695
Be bother and confusticate these Dwarves!

23:16.896 --> 23:19.740
My dear Bilbo, what on earth is the matter?

23:19.899 --> 23:22.743
What's the matter?
I'm surrounded by Dwarves.

23:22.902 --> 23:24.449
What are they doing here?

23:24.695 --> 23:28.416
Oh, they're quite a merry gathering
once you get used to them.

23:28.574 --> 23:30.576
I don't want to get used to them.

23:30.701 --> 23:33.875
Look at the state of my kitchen.
There's mud trod into the carpet.

23:34.038 --> 23:35.460
They've pillaged the pantry.

23:35.581 --> 23:38.050
I won't tell you what they've done
in the bathroom.

23:38.208 --> 23:42.008
They've destroyed the plumbing. I don't
understand what they're doing in my house!

23:42.212 --> 23:47.434
Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt,
but what should I do with my plate?

23:47.635 --> 23:49.854
Here you go, Ori. Give it to me.

23:54.683 --> 23:56.685
Take that back. Excuse me.

23:56.852 --> 23:58.775
That's my mother's West Farthing pottery.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.940
It's over 100 years old!

24:04.360 --> 24:06.829
And can you not do that? You'll blunt them.

24:06.987 --> 24:08.989
Ooh. Do you hear that, lads?

24:09.740 --> 24:12.493
He says we'll blunt the knives.

24:12.660 --> 24:14.628
<i>♪ Blunt the knives, bend the forks ♪</i>

24:14.745 --> 24:17.248
<i>♪ Smash the bottles and bum the corks ♪</i>

24:17.456 --> 24:20.585
<i>♪ Chip the glasses and crack the plates ♪</i>

24:20.793 --> 24:22.636
<i>♪ That's what Bilbo Baggins hates ♪</i>

24:22.795 --> 24:24.342
<i>♪ Cut the cloth, tread on the fat ♪</i>

24:50.864 --> 24:53.162

24:56.078 --> 24:58.126
Bilbo.

25:07.131 --> 25:08.678
He is here.

25:12.886 --> 25:14.888
Gandalf.

25:16.056 --> 25:18.525
I thought you said this place
would be easy to find.

25:18.726 --> 25:20.728
I lost my way, twice.

25:20.894 --> 25:24.319
I wouldn't have found it at all
had it not been for that mark on the door.

25:24.481 --> 25:27.360
Mark? There's no mark on that door.
It was painted a week ago.

25:27.526 --> 25:30.871
There is a mark. I put it there myself.

25:31.572 --> 25:35.668
Bilbo Baggins, allow me to introduce
the leader of our company:

25:36.243 --> 25:38.211
Thorin Oakenshield.

25:38.370 --> 25:39.872
So...

25:41.457 --> 25:43.334
...this is the Hobbit.

25:44.209 --> 25:46.553
Tell me, Mr. Baggins,
have you done much fighting?

25:46.712 --> 25:48.214
- Pardon me?
- Ax or sword?

25:48.881 --> 25:50.349
What's your weapon of choice?

25:50.549 --> 25:54.053
Well, I do have some skill at conkers,
if you must know...

25:54.219 --> 25:57.814
...but I fail to see why that's relevant.

25:58.223 --> 25:59.816
Thought as much.

25:59.975 --> 26:02.774
He looks more like a grocer than a burglar.

26:08.067 --> 26:11.742
What news from the meeting in Ered Luin?
Did they all come?

26:11.904 --> 26:14.908
- Aye. Envoys from all seven kingdoms.
- All of them!

26:15.115 --> 26:17.709
And what did the Dwarves
of the Iron Hills say?

26:18.911 --> 26:20.834
Is Dain with us?

26:23.207 --> 26:24.629
They will not come.

26:28.045 --> 26:32.300
They say this quest is ours and ours alone.

26:34.259 --> 26:36.853
You're going on a quest?

26:37.554 --> 26:42.902
Bilbo, my dear fellow,
let us have a little more light.

26:43.393 --> 26:45.395
Far to the east...

26:45.771 --> 26:48.524
...over ranges and rivers...

26:48.816 --> 26:52.116
...beyond woodlands and wastelands...

26:52.277 --> 26:54.655
...lies a single, solitary peak.

26:58.158 --> 26:59.956
"The Lonely Mountain."

27:00.619 --> 27:03.589
Aye, Oin has read the portents...

27:03.789 --> 27:07.259
...and the portents say it is time.

27:07.584 --> 27:12.431
Ravens have been seen flying back
to the mountain, as it was foretold.

27:12.589 --> 27:16.514
"When the birds of yore return to Erebor...

27:16.718 --> 27:20.188
...the reign of the beast will end."

27:22.474 --> 27:24.602
Uh, what beast?

27:24.768 --> 27:27.021
That would be a reference
to Smaug the Terrible...

27:27.187 --> 27:31.033
...chiefest and greatest
calamity of our age.

27:31.859 --> 27:33.577
Airborne fire-breather.

27:33.735 --> 27:36.534
Teeth like razors, claws like meat hooks.

27:36.697 --> 27:39.701
- Extremely fond of precious metals.
- Yes, I know what a dragon is.

27:39.908 --> 27:41.501
I'm not afraid. I'm up for it.

27:41.660 --> 27:44.584
I'll give him a taste of Dwarfish iron
right up his jacksie!

27:44.705 --> 27:46.207
- Good lad, Ori!
- Sit down.

27:46.456 --> 27:49.380
The task would be difficult enough
with an army behind us...

27:49.501 --> 27:51.674
...but we number just 13.

27:51.879 --> 27:53.802
And not 13 of the best...

27:54.423 --> 27:55.720
...nor brightest.

27:56.008 --> 27:58.136
Here, who are you calling dim?

27:58.302 --> 27:59.849
Sorry, what did he say?

28:00.012 --> 28:01.980
We may be few in number...

28:02.764 --> 28:06.519
...but we're fighters, all of us,
to the last Dwarf.

28:06.685 --> 28:09.063
And you forget,
we have a Wizard in our company.

28:09.229 --> 28:12.028
Gandalf will have killed
hundreds of dragons in his time.

28:12.232 --> 28:14.200
Oh, well, no. I wouldn't say...

28:14.401 --> 28:16.403
- How many, then?
- What?

28:16.570 --> 28:18.868
Well, how many dragons have you killed?

28:20.949 --> 28:23.327
Go on. Give us a number.

28:25.954 --> 28:27.001
Excuse me. Please.

28:32.002 --> 28:33.379
If we have read these signs...

28:33.545 --> 28:36.219
...do you not think others
will have read them too?

28:38.550 --> 28:41.099
Rumors have begun to spread.

28:41.511 --> 28:44.185
The dragon, Smaug,
has not been seen for 60 years.

28:45.849 --> 28:48.068
Eyes look east to the
mountain, assessing...

28:49.019 --> 28:52.239
...wondering, weighing the risk.

28:52.689 --> 28:55.488
Perhaps the vast wealth of our people
now lies unprotected.

28:55.651 --> 28:59.121
Do we sit back while others claim
what is rightfully ours?

28:59.863 --> 29:02.707
Or do we seize this chance
to take back Erebor?

29:04.952 --> 29:07.751
You forget, the Front Gate is sealed.

29:08.455 --> 29:11.299
There is no way into the mountain.

29:11.458 --> 29:14.758
That, my dear Balin, is not entirely true.

29:18.799 --> 29:20.267
How come you by this?

29:21.051 --> 29:23.600
It was given to me by your father.

29:23.804 --> 29:27.104
By Thrain. For safekeeping.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.977
It is yours now.

29:37.359 --> 29:38.781
If there is a key...

29:39.820 --> 29:41.413
...there must be a door.

29:42.281 --> 29:46.536
These runes speak of a hidden
passage to the Lower Halls.

29:46.660 --> 29:48.833
There's another way in.

29:49.037 --> 29:52.837
Well, if we can find it,
but Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

29:55.210 --> 29:58.054
The answer lies hidden somewhere
in this map...

29:58.213 --> 30:00.215
...and I do not have the skill to find it.

30:00.340 --> 30:04.766
But there are others in Middle-earth
who can.

30:05.595 --> 30:08.940
The task I have in mind
will require a great deal of stealth...

30:09.141 --> 30:11.143
...and no small amount of courage.

30:12.352 --> 30:17.153
But if we are careful and clever,
I believe that it can be done.

30:17.316 --> 30:18.863
That's why we need a burglar.

30:19.192 --> 30:22.662
Hmm. And a good one too.
An expert, I'd imagine.

30:22.821 --> 30:25.119
And are you?

30:27.659 --> 30:29.036
Am I what?

30:29.202 --> 30:31.955
He said he's an expert. Hey.

30:32.497 --> 30:37.344
Me? No. No, no, no. I'm not a burglar.
I've never stolen a thing in my life.

30:37.502 --> 30:40.221
Well, I'm afraid I have to agree
with Mr. Baggins.

30:40.380 --> 30:42.382
He's hardly burglar material.

30:42.591 --> 30:43.638
Nope.

30:43.800 --> 30:48.101
Aye, the Wild is no place for gentle folk who
can neither fight nor fend for themselves.

30:48.221 --> 30:50.144
He's just fine.

30:55.729 --> 30:56.946
Enough!

30:57.105 --> 31:02.032
If I say Bilbo Baggins is a burglar,
then a burglar he is.

31:03.028 --> 31:05.872
Hobbits are remarkably light on their feet.

31:06.031 --> 31:09.285
In fact, they can pass unseen by most,
if they choose.

31:09.451 --> 31:13.081
And, while the dragon is accustomed
to the smell of Dwarf...

31:13.246 --> 31:16.341
...the scent of a Hobbit
is all but unknown to him...

31:16.500 --> 31:19.674
...which gives us a distinct advantage.

31:19.836 --> 31:24.262
You asked me to find the 14th member of
this company and I have chosen Mr. Baggins.

31:24.549 --> 31:27.519
There's a lot more to him
than appearances suggest.

31:27.677 --> 31:30.521
And he's got a great deal more to offer
than any of you know.

31:32.099 --> 31:33.442
Including himself.

31:39.189 --> 31:41.692
You must trust me on this.

31:44.736 --> 31:46.033
Very well.

31:46.405 --> 31:47.952
- We will do it your way.
- No, no.

31:48.156 --> 31:50.579
- Give him the contract.
- We're in. We're off.

31:50.742 --> 31:51.789
It's just the usual.

31:51.952 --> 31:53.954
Summary of out-of-pocket expenses...

31:54.121 --> 31:55.714
...time required, remuneration...

31:56.081 --> 31:57.754
...funeral arrangements, so forth.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.127
Funeral arrangements?

32:05.924 --> 32:07.426
I cannot guarantee his safety.

32:08.135 --> 32:09.387
Understood.

32:09.845 --> 32:12.394
Nor will I be responsible for his fate.

32:16.309 --> 32:17.606
Agreed.

32:17.769 --> 32:22.320
"Terms: Cash on delivery, up to but not exceeding
one-fourteenth of total profit, if any."

32:22.524 --> 32:24.401
Hmm. Seems fair.

32:24.568 --> 32:28.289
"Present company shall not be liable
for injuries inflicted by...

32:28.447 --> 32:33.704
...or sustained as a consequence thereof,
including, but not limited to lacerations...

32:35.120 --> 32:36.793
...evisceration..."

32:39.458 --> 32:40.459
Incineration?

32:40.625 --> 32:43.595
Aye. He'll melt the flesh off your bones
in the blink of an eye.

32:48.842 --> 32:51.766
- You all right, laddie?
- Huh? Yeah.

32:53.513 --> 32:54.856
Feel a bit faint.

32:55.223 --> 32:57.191
- Think furnace with wings.
- Air.

32:57.350 --> 32:58.852
I need air.

32:59.019 --> 33:01.613
Flash of light, searing pain, then poof.

33:01.771 --> 33:03.773
You're nothing more than a pile of ash.

33:03.940 --> 33:05.317
Hmm.

33:10.155 --> 33:11.156
Nope.

33:12.365 --> 33:14.242
Oh, very helpful, Bofur.

33:14.576 --> 33:17.170
I'll be all right.
Just let me sit quietly for a moment.

33:17.329 --> 33:20.674
You've been sitting
quietly for far too long.

33:20.999 --> 33:25.129
Tell me, when did doilies
and your mother's dishes...

33:25.337 --> 33:26.964
...become so important to you?

33:27.506 --> 33:32.307
I remember a young Hobbit who was always
running off in search of Elves in the woods.

33:32.511 --> 33:35.685
Who would stay out late,
come home after dark...

33:35.847 --> 33:39.477
...trailing mud and twigs and fireflies.

33:39.643 --> 33:42.021
A young Hobbit who would have liked
nothing better...

33:42.229 --> 33:45.654
...than to find out what was beyond
the borders of the Shire.

33:46.316 --> 33:50.071
The world is not in your books and maps.

33:51.363 --> 33:53.286
It's out there.

33:54.991 --> 33:57.244
I can't just go running off into the blue.

33:57.410 --> 34:00.584
I am a Baggins of Bag-end.

34:00.705 --> 34:02.878
You are also a Took.

34:04.834 --> 34:08.213
Did you know that your
great-great-great-great-uncle Bullroarer Took...

34:08.380 --> 34:11.007
...was so large, he could
ride a real horse?

34:11.216 --> 34:13.344
- Yes.
- Yes, well, he could.

34:13.510 --> 34:16.389
In the Battle of Green Fields,
he charged the Goblin ranks.

34:16.554 --> 34:20.400
He swung his club so hard, it knocked
the Goblin king's head clean off...

34:20.559 --> 34:24.735
...and it sailed 100 yards through the air
and went down a rabbit hole.

34:24.980 --> 34:26.652
And thus, the battle was won.

34:27.440 --> 34:30.444
And the game of golf invented
at the same time.

34:33.572 --> 34:35.791
I do believe you made that up.

34:35.949 --> 34:39.704
Well, all good stories
deserve embellishment.

34:41.246 --> 34:45.217
You'll have a tale or two to tell
of your own when you come back.

34:48.962 --> 34:51.181
Can you promise that I will come back?

34:53.132 --> 34:54.635
No.

34:54.842 --> 34:56.891
And if you do...

34:57.721 --> 35:00.019
...you will not be the same.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.352
That's what I thought.

35:04.519 --> 35:07.568
Sorry, Gandalf, I can't sign this.

35:09.107 --> 35:11.360
You've got the wrong Hobbit.

35:17.782 --> 35:21.412
It appears we have lost our burglar.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.456
Probably for the best.

35:24.623 --> 35:27.001
The odds were always against us.

35:27.167 --> 35:30.171
After all, what are we?

35:30.670 --> 35:33.514
Merchants, miners...

35:34.132 --> 35:36.305
...tinkers, toy-makers.

35:36.468 --> 35:39.438
Heh, heh. Hardly the stuff of legend.

35:39.929 --> 35:42.773
There are a few warriors amongst us.

35:43.433 --> 35:45.310
Old warriors.

35:45.477 --> 35:47.855
I would take each and every one
of these Dwarves...

35:47.979 --> 35:50.152
...over an army from the Iron Hills.

35:50.357 --> 35:53.281
For when I called upon them,
they answered.

35:54.027 --> 35:56.621
Loyalty, honor...

35:57.030 --> 35:58.828
...a willing heart.

36:00.450 --> 36:03.044
I can ask no more than that.

36:03.620 --> 36:05.793
You don't have to do this.

36:06.206 --> 36:07.833
You have a choice.

36:07.999 --> 36:11.003
You've done honorably by our people.

36:11.836 --> 36:15.636
You have built a new life for us
in the Blue Mountains.

36:15.965 --> 36:18.969
A life of peace and plenty.

36:19.803 --> 36:24.775
A life that is worth more than
all the gold in Erebor.

36:25.308 --> 36:30.235
From my grandfather to my father,
this has come to me.

36:31.856 --> 36:35.736
They dreamt of the day when the Dwarves
of Erebor would reclaim their homeland.

36:37.570 --> 36:40.039
There is no choice, Balin.

36:41.491 --> 36:43.038
Not for me.

36:45.412 --> 36:47.085
Then we are with you, laddie.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.384
We will see it done.

39:05.176 --> 39:06.894
Hello?

39:17.021 --> 39:18.193
Yes.

39:18.731 --> 39:21.200
Yes.

40:32.680 --> 40:35.103
Here, Mr. Bilbo, where are you off to?

40:35.266 --> 40:38.019
- Can't stop, I'm already late!
- Late for what?

40:38.311 --> 40:41.281
I'm going on an adventure!

40:46.819 --> 40:50.244
I said it. Didn't I say it?
Coming here was a waste of time.

40:50.406 --> 40:51.953
That's true enough.

40:52.158 --> 40:55.082
Ridiculous notion. Use a Hobbit?
A Halfling?

40:55.244 --> 40:56.621
Whose idea was it anyway?

40:56.829 --> 40:57.830
Wait!

40:58.748 --> 40:59.795
Wait!

40:59.958 --> 41:01.505
Whoa, whoa.

41:03.169 --> 41:05.422
Whoa, whoa.

41:11.010 --> 41:12.603
I signed it.

41:14.305 --> 41:15.602
Here.

41:24.941 --> 41:27.444
Everything appears to be in order.

41:27.610 --> 41:29.988
Welcome, Master Baggins...

41:30.655 --> 41:34.205
...to the company of Thorin Oakenshield.

41:39.580 --> 41:40.752
Give him a pony.

41:41.207 --> 41:42.800
No, no, that won't be necessary.

41:42.959 --> 41:45.178
Thank you. I'm sure I can keep up on foot.

41:45.336 --> 41:47.885
I've done my fair share of
walking holidays, you know?

41:48.089 --> 41:50.137
Even got as far as Frogmorton once. Aah!

42:04.022 --> 42:05.899
Come on, Nori. Pay up.

42:07.900 --> 42:09.994
- One more.
- Thanks, lad.

42:10.153 --> 42:11.746
What's that about?

42:11.863 --> 42:16.460
Oh, they took wagers
on whether or not you'd turn up.

42:16.617 --> 42:19.461
Most of them bet that you wouldn't.

42:20.830 --> 42:22.423
And what did you think?

42:22.540 --> 42:24.167
Well...

42:27.211 --> 42:31.808
My dear fellow,
I never doubted you for a second.

42:36.679 --> 42:40.604
It's horse hair. Having a reaction.

42:42.226 --> 42:43.853
No, wait, wait, stop.

42:44.479 --> 42:46.573
Stop! We have to turn around.

42:46.898 --> 42:48.900
What on earth is the matter?

42:49.025 --> 42:51.244
- I forgot my handkerchief.
- Here.

42:52.904 --> 42:53.905
Use this.

42:58.367 --> 42:59.835
Move on.

43:07.001 --> 43:09.800
<i>You'll have to manage
without pocket handkerchiefs...</i>

43:10.004 --> 43:12.348
<i>...and a good many other things,
Bilbo Baggins...</i>

43:12.465 --> 43:15.890
<i>...before we reach our journey's end.</i>

43:16.552 --> 43:21.900
<i>You were born to the rolling hills
and little rivers of the Shire.</i>

43:22.934 --> 43:25.813
<i>But home is now behind you.</i>

43:25.978 --> 43:29.107
<i>The world is ahead.</i>

44:09.814 --> 44:13.193
Hello, girl. Who's a good girl?

44:16.737 --> 44:18.660
It's our little secret, Myrtle.

44:18.823 --> 44:20.791
You must tell no one. Shh, shh.

44:25.538 --> 44:26.585
What was that?

44:27.957 --> 44:29.004
Orcs.

44:29.709 --> 44:30.710
Orcs?

44:32.420 --> 44:35.344
Throat-cutters.
There'll be dozens of them out there.

44:35.840 --> 44:37.638
The lone-lands are crawling with them.

44:37.800 --> 44:40.679
They strike in the wee small hours
when everyone's asleep.

44:40.845 --> 44:44.019
Quick and quiet, no screams.
Just lots of blood.

44:48.561 --> 44:50.234
You think that's funny?

44:52.190 --> 44:54.568
You think a night raid by Orcs is a joke?

44:55.359 --> 44:56.781
We didn't mean anything by it.

44:57.945 --> 44:59.743
No, you didn't.

45:00.072 --> 45:02.370
You know nothing of the world.

45:03.993 --> 45:06.246
Don't mind him, laddie.

45:06.412 --> 45:11.134
Thorin has more cause than most
to hate Orcs.

45:15.963 --> 45:19.012
After the dragon took
the Lonely Mountain...

45:19.217 --> 45:25.020
...King Thror tried to reclaim
the ancient Dwarf kingdom of Moria.

45:26.891 --> 45:30.236
<i>But our enemy had got there first.</i>

45:42.531 --> 45:46.581
<i>Moria had been taken by legions of Orcs...</i>

45:46.744 --> 45:51.466
<i>...led by the most vile of all their race:</i>

45:51.916 --> 45:55.045
<i>Azog the Defiler.</i>

45:57.338 --> 46:00.057
<i>The giant Gundabad Orc...</i>

46:00.508 --> 46:05.480
...had sworn to wipe out the line of Durin.

46:09.684 --> 46:11.436
He began...

46:12.520 --> 46:14.397
...by beheading the king.

46:25.783 --> 46:28.627
No!

46:29.829 --> 46:34.676
Thrain, Thorin's father,
was driven mad by grief.

46:34.834 --> 46:37.462
He went missing. Taken
prisoner or killed...

46:38.129 --> 46:40.223
...we did not know.

46:41.090 --> 46:42.558
We were leaderless.

46:43.301 --> 46:46.851
<i>Defeat and death...</i>

46:47.013 --> 46:48.856
<i>...were upon us.</i>

46:51.809 --> 46:55.655
That is when I saw him.

46:57.898 --> 46:59.616
A young Dwarf prince...

47:00.609 --> 47:04.204
<i>...facing down the pale Orc.</i>

47:08.451 --> 47:12.046
<i>He stood alone against this terrible foe.</i>

47:21.797 --> 47:23.390
<i>His armor rent...</i>

47:23.591 --> 47:27.061
<i>...wielding nothing but an oaken branch
as a shield.</i>

47:40.149 --> 47:44.780
<i>Azog the Defiler learned that day...</i>

47:45.404 --> 47:49.705
...that the line of Durin
would not be so easily broken.

48:17.686 --> 48:19.188
<i>Our forces rallied...</i>

48:20.439 --> 48:22.908
<i>wand drove the Orcs back.</i>

48:24.777 --> 48:26.074
<i>And our enemy...</i>

48:26.904 --> 48:28.872
<i>...had been defeated.</i>

48:30.366 --> 48:32.710
But there was no feast...

48:33.411 --> 48:36.164
<i>...nor song that night...</i>

48:36.330 --> 48:41.131
<i>...for our dead
were beyond the count of grief.</i>

48:42.211 --> 48:45.556
<i>We few had survived.</i>

48:52.721 --> 48:55.645
<i>And I thought to myself then...</i>

48:58.394 --> 49:02.740
<i>...there is one who I could follow.</i>

49:04.900 --> 49:06.994
There is one...

49:07.778 --> 49:09.746
...I could call king.

49:28.716 --> 49:30.013
And the pale Orc?

49:32.428 --> 49:33.896
What happened to him?

49:34.054 --> 49:37.604
He slunk back into the hole
whence he came.

49:38.058 --> 49:41.653
That filth died of his wounds long ago.

50:27.733 --> 50:31.363
Here, Mr. Gandalf, can't you do something
about this deluge?

50:31.987 --> 50:34.410
It is raining, Master Dwarf...

50:34.573 --> 50:38.294
...and it will continue to rain
until the rain is done.

50:38.869 --> 50:42.919
If you wish to change the weather of the world,
you should find yourself another Wizard.

50:44.583 --> 50:45.880
- Are there any?
- What?

50:46.043 --> 50:48.671
- Other Wizards.
- There are five of us.

50:48.837 --> 50:53.343
The greatest of our order
is Saruman the White.

50:53.551 --> 50:56.020
Then there are the two Blue Wizards...

50:57.346 --> 50:59.724
Do you know,
I've quite forgotten their names.

51:00.891 --> 51:02.108
And who is the fifth?

51:02.309 --> 51:06.280
Well, that would be Radagast the Brown.

51:06.438 --> 51:10.193
Is he a great Wizard?
Or is he more like you?

51:12.278 --> 51:16.954
I think he's a very great Wizard,
in his own way.

51:17.449 --> 51:21.750
He's a gentle soul who prefers
the company of animals to others.

51:21.912 --> 51:24.961
He keeps a watchful eye
over the vast forest lands...

51:25.165 --> 51:27.714
<i>...to the east. And a good thing too.</i>

51:27.876 --> 51:32.928
<i>For always evil will look to find
a foothold in this world.</i>

51:39.430 --> 51:42.604
Not good. Not good at all.

51:49.982 --> 51:51.325
Eww.

52:06.749 --> 52:09.093
Oh, no. Sebastian.

52:12.796 --> 52:13.843
Good gracious.

52:34.735 --> 52:35.782
Come on.

52:35.944 --> 52:39.039
Move back! Give him some air,
for goodness sake.

52:48.957 --> 52:50.630
There. There.

52:51.960 --> 52:54.634
I don't understand why it's not working.

52:54.797 --> 52:57.266
It's not as if it's witchcraft.

53:00.260 --> 53:02.558
Witchcraft.

53:03.639 --> 53:07.735
Oh, but it is.

53:08.644 --> 53:14.322
A dark and powerful magic.

54:46.116 --> 54:50.667
Where on this good earth
did those foul creatures come from?

54:52.915 --> 54:54.588
The old fortress?

54:55.209 --> 54:56.381
Show me.

55:29.952 --> 55:31.704
We'll camp here for the night.

55:32.204 --> 55:36.584
Fili, Kili, look after the ponies.
Make sure you stay with them.

55:36.834 --> 55:40.884
A farmer and his family used to live here.

55:41.046 --> 55:43.845
- Oin, Gloin. Get a fire going.
- Aye.

55:44.007 --> 55:45.054
Right you are.

55:45.217 --> 55:48.847
I think it would be wiser to move on.

55:49.847 --> 55:52.726
We could make for the Hidden Valley.

55:53.016 --> 55:54.893
I have told you already...

55:55.060 --> 55:56.937
...I will not go near that place.

55:57.104 --> 55:59.402
Why not? The Elves could help us.

55:59.565 --> 56:01.659
We could get food, rest, advice.

56:01.859 --> 56:03.907
I do not need their advice.

56:04.111 --> 56:08.161
We have a map that we cannot read.
Lord Elrond could help us.

56:08.323 --> 56:09.700
Help?

56:10.701 --> 56:12.829
A dragon attacks Erebor.

56:12.995 --> 56:15.248
What help came from the Elves?

56:16.331 --> 56:18.254
Orcs plunder Moria...

56:18.417 --> 56:20.840
...desecrate our sacred halls.

56:21.003 --> 56:23.882
The Elves looked on and did nothing.

56:24.882 --> 56:28.932
And you ask me to seek out the very people
who betrayed my grandfather.

56:29.094 --> 56:30.391
Who betrayed my father.

56:30.554 --> 56:32.352
You are neither of them.

56:33.223 --> 56:36.727
I did not give you that map and key
for you to hold onto the past.

56:36.894 --> 56:38.942
I did not know that they
were yours to keep.

56:45.152 --> 56:47.871
Everything all right?
Gandalf, where are you going?

56:48.030 --> 56:51.455
To seek the company of the
only one around here who's got any sense.

56:51.617 --> 56:54.291
- And who's that?
- Myself, Mr. Baggins.

56:54.745 --> 56:57.248
I've had enough of Dwarves for one day.

56:59.207 --> 57:01.130
Come on, Bombur, we're hungry.

57:01.793 --> 57:03.921
Is he coming back?

57:08.383 --> 57:09.635
He's been a long time.

57:09.843 --> 57:11.140
- Who?
- Gandalf.

57:11.261 --> 57:13.434
He's a Wizard. He does as he chooses.

57:13.639 --> 57:16.688
Here, do us a favor. Take this to the lads.

57:17.267 --> 57:18.814
Stop it. You've had plenty.

57:18.977 --> 57:22.607
Aye, it's not a bad stew, Bombur.
I've had worse.

57:22.773 --> 57:24.821
Dori could've cooked it. Ha-ha-ha.

57:24.942 --> 57:27.240
Hilarious.

57:37.955 --> 57:39.252
What's the matter?

57:39.456 --> 57:43.836
- We're supposed to be looking after the ponies.
- Only we've encountered a slight problem.

57:44.002 --> 57:45.845
We had 16.

57:46.046 --> 57:48.845
Now there's 14.

57:52.260 --> 57:54.479
Daisy and Bungo are missing.

57:54.680 --> 57:56.478
Well, that's not good. Ha, ha.

57:56.640 --> 57:59.268
And that is not good at all.
Shouldn't we tell Thorin?

57:59.434 --> 58:02.358
Uh, no. Let's not worry him.

58:02.521 --> 58:05.775
As our official burglar,
we thought you might like to look into it.

58:05.941 --> 58:07.318
Well, uh...

58:07.859 --> 58:11.989
- Look, something big uprooted these trees.
- That was our thinking.

58:12.197 --> 58:16.668
It's something very big
and possibly quite dangerous.

58:17.536 --> 58:18.583
Hey.

58:19.162 --> 58:20.664
There's a light.

58:21.331 --> 58:22.753
Over here.

58:25.293 --> 58:26.294
Stay down.

58:31.758 --> 58:33.180
What is it?

58:33.343 --> 58:34.765
Trolls.

58:53.071 --> 58:54.072
Oh.

59:01.705 --> 59:03.673
He's got Myrtle and Minty.

59:04.750 --> 59:07.503
I think they're gonna eat them.
We have to do something.

59:07.711 --> 59:09.509
Yes, you should.

59:09.796 --> 59:13.767
Mountain Trolls are slow and stupid,
and you're so small, they'll never see you.

59:13.967 --> 59:15.935
It's perfectly safe. We'll be behind you.

59:16.094 --> 59:19.724
If you run into trouble, hoot twice
like a barn owl and once like a brown owl.

59:19.890 --> 59:22.860
Twice like a barn owl.
No, twice like a brown... Once like a...

59:23.060 --> 59:24.983
Like a... Are you sure this is a good idea?

59:25.353 --> 59:28.402
Mutton yesterday, mutton today...

59:28.565 --> 59:32.035
...and, blimey, if it don't look like
mutton again tomorrow.

59:33.111 --> 59:35.113
Quit your griping.

59:35.322 --> 59:39.577
These ain't sheep. These is fresh nags.

59:39.743 --> 59:45.091
Oh! I don't like horse. I never have.
Not enough fat on them.

59:45.248 --> 59:47.592
Well, it's better than leathery old farmer.

59:47.751 --> 59:52.131
All skin and bone, he was. I'm still
picking bits of him out of me teeth.

59:53.465 --> 59:56.594
Well, that's lovely, that is. A floater.

59:56.802 --> 59:58.725
Might improve the flavor.

59:58.887 --> 01:00:01.436
Ah. There's more where that came from.

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:02.937
- Oh, no, you don't!
- Ow!

01:00:06.895 --> 01:00:08.772
Sit down!

01:00:16.905 --> 01:00:21.126
Well, I hope you're gonna gut these nags.

01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:24.003
I don't like the stinky parts.

01:00:24.287 --> 01:00:27.131
- Ow!
- I said sit down.

01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:28.337
I'm starving!

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:31.595
Now, are we having horse tonight or what?

01:00:31.753 --> 01:00:35.803
Shut your cakehole.
You'll eat what I give you.

01:00:36.675 --> 01:00:40.350
How come he's the cook?
Everything tastes the same.

01:00:40.512 --> 01:00:42.139
Everything tastes like chicken.

01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:43.477
Except the chicken.

01:00:43.682 --> 01:00:45.025
What tastes like fish!

01:00:45.142 --> 01:00:48.487
I'm just saying,
a little appreciation would be nice.

01:00:50.856 --> 01:00:54.611
Oh. "Thank you very much, Bert.
Lovely stew, Bert."

01:00:54.818 --> 01:00:58.743
- How hard is that?
- Shh. Shh, shh. Shh.

01:00:59.197 --> 01:01:01.996
Just needs a sprinkle of squirrel dung.

01:01:03.118 --> 01:01:05.041
Here, that's my grog.

01:01:07.664 --> 01:01:10.668
Sorry. Ow!

01:01:12.544 --> 01:01:16.799
Ooh. That is beautifully balanced, that is.

01:01:17.424 --> 01:01:20.348
Wrap your laughing gear around that, eh?

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:22.345
Good, isn't it?

01:01:24.306 --> 01:01:26.855
That's why I'm the cook.

01:01:34.608 --> 01:01:38.829
Oh, my guts are grumbling.
I got to snaffle something.

01:01:38.987 --> 01:01:41.740
- Flesh, I need flesh.
- Ah! Ah!

01:01:45.243 --> 01:01:46.244
Blimey!

01:01:47.037 --> 01:01:49.916
Bert. Bert!
Look what's come out of me hooter.

01:01:50.081 --> 01:01:52.209
It's got arms and legs and everything.

01:01:52.542 --> 01:01:54.010
What is it?

01:01:54.169 --> 01:01:56.843
I don't know. But I don't like
the way it wriggles around.

01:02:00.842 --> 01:02:04.062
What are you, then? An oversized squirrel?

01:02:04.221 --> 01:02:05.939
I'm a burglar... Uh, Hobbit.

01:02:06.097 --> 01:02:08.191
A burglar Hobbit?

01:02:08.350 --> 01:02:09.977
Can we cook him?

01:02:10.101 --> 01:02:12.695
We can try.

01:02:15.482 --> 01:02:17.576
He wouldn't make more than a mouthful.

01:02:17.734 --> 01:02:20.533
Not when he's skinned and boned.

01:02:20.737 --> 01:02:23.707
Perhaps there's more burglar Hobbits
around these parts.

01:02:23.865 --> 01:02:26.869
Might be enough for a pie.

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:29.128
- Grab him!
- He's too quick.

01:02:29.329 --> 01:02:32.629
Right. Come here, you little...

01:02:32.791 --> 01:02:34.008
Gotcha.

01:02:34.417 --> 01:02:37.967
Are there any more of you little fellas
hiding where you shouldn't?

01:02:38.171 --> 01:02:39.764
No.

01:02:40.048 --> 01:02:41.300
He's lying.

01:02:41.508 --> 01:02:45.854
- No, I'm not!
- Hold his toes over the fire.

01:02:46.054 --> 01:02:48.728
Make him squeal!

01:02:52.143 --> 01:02:53.235
Drop him!

01:02:53.395 --> 01:02:54.817
You what?

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:57.073
I said...

01:02:57.357 --> 01:02:58.404
...drop him.

01:03:21.339 --> 01:03:25.094
Get the sacks! Stick them in the sacks!

01:03:47.324 --> 01:03:48.792
Ow!

01:04:14.392 --> 01:04:16.565
Come on! Get up!

01:04:16.853 --> 01:04:18.150
- Bilbo!
- Don't!

01:04:19.773 --> 01:04:21.775
Lay down your arms...

01:04:22.442 --> 01:04:24.240
...or we'll rip his off.

01:04:38.875 --> 01:04:40.877
Oh! That's hot, that's hot, that's hot!

01:04:41.044 --> 01:04:42.671
Don't bother cooking them.

01:04:42.837 --> 01:04:47.092
Let's just sit on them
and squash them into jelly.

01:04:47.258 --> 01:04:51.434
They should be sautéed and grilled
with a sprinkle of sage.

01:04:51.638 --> 01:04:53.140
Is this really necessary?

01:04:53.348 --> 01:04:55.100
That does sound quite nice.

01:04:55.266 --> 01:04:57.735
- Untie me, mister.
- Eat someone your own size.

01:04:58.436 --> 01:05:00.359
Never mind the seasoning.

01:05:00.522 --> 01:05:02.274
We ain't got all night.

01:05:02.482 --> 01:05:05.827
Dawn ain't far away.
Let's get a move on.

01:05:05.944 --> 01:05:08.413
I don't fancy being turned to stone.

01:05:11.116 --> 01:05:12.459
Wait!

01:05:12.617 --> 01:05:15.621
You are making a terrible mistake.

01:05:15.787 --> 01:05:18.040
You can't reason with them.
They're half-wits!

01:05:18.206 --> 01:05:20.300
Half-wits? What does that make us?

01:05:20.917 --> 01:05:23.716
I meant with the seasoning.

01:05:24.045 --> 01:05:26.639
What about the seasoning?

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:28.092
Well, have you smelt them?

01:05:28.425 --> 01:05:31.975
You're gonna need something stronger
than sage before you plate this lot up.

01:05:32.137 --> 01:05:35.232
- Traitor!
- What do you know about cooking Dwarf?

01:05:35.807 --> 01:05:36.854
Shut up.

01:05:37.183 --> 01:05:40.858
Let the flurgaburburhobbit talk.

01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:44.695
The secret to cooking Dwarf is...

01:05:44.858 --> 01:05:47.953
- Yes? Come on. Tell us the secret.
- It's, uh...

01:05:48.153 --> 01:05:50.201
Yes, I'm telling you. The secret is...

01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:54.492
...to skin them first.

01:05:54.659 --> 01:05:56.627
What? Skin us?

01:05:56.744 --> 01:05:59.293
Tom, get me filleting knife.

01:05:59.456 --> 01:06:01.129
I'll skin you, you little...!

01:06:01.291 --> 01:06:03.168
I won't forget that. I won't forget it.

01:06:03.334 --> 01:06:05.632
What a load of rubbish.

01:06:05.837 --> 01:06:08.761
I've eaten plenty with their skins on.

01:06:08.923 --> 01:06:11.301
Scarf them, I say, boots and all.

01:06:11.926 --> 01:06:14.224
He's right.

01:06:14.345 --> 01:06:17.019
Nothing wrong with a bit of raw Dwarf.

01:06:19.767 --> 01:06:21.940
Nice and crunchy.

01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:24.819
Oh, not that one. He's infected.

01:06:25.106 --> 01:06:26.733
- Huh?
- You what?

01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:30.996
Yeah, he's got worms in his tubes.

01:06:31.196 --> 01:06:33.164
- Eww!
- Aah!

01:06:33.406 --> 01:06:36.660
In fact, they all have.
They're infested with parasites.

01:06:36.826 --> 01:06:39.830
It's a terrible business.
I wouldn't risk it. I really wouldn't.

01:06:39.996 --> 01:06:41.873
Parasites? Did he say "parasites"?

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:44.839
We don't have parasites.
You have parasites!

01:06:45.543 --> 01:06:47.511
What are you talking about, laddie?

01:06:51.049 --> 01:06:52.926
I've got parasites as big as my arm.

01:06:53.092 --> 01:06:55.686
Mine are the biggest parasites.
I've got huge parasites.

01:06:57.722 --> 01:06:59.190
- We're riddled.
- Yes, I'm riddled.

01:06:59.349 --> 01:07:00.646
Yes, we are, badly.

01:07:00.808 --> 01:07:03.687
What would you have us do, then?

01:07:03.853 --> 01:07:05.355
Let them all go?

01:07:05.813 --> 01:07:09.067
- Well...
- You think I don't know what you're up to?

01:07:09.526 --> 01:07:13.622
This little ferret is taking us for fools.

01:07:14.072 --> 01:07:15.619
- Ferret?
- Fools?

01:07:15.782 --> 01:07:18.706
The dawn will take you all.

01:07:20.161 --> 01:07:21.754
- Who's that?
- No idea.

01:07:21.913 --> 01:07:23.085
Can we eat him too?

01:07:49.232 --> 01:07:51.781
Get your foot out of my back.

01:07:57.740 --> 01:07:59.037
Ah.

01:08:01.286 --> 01:08:03.459
Where did you go to, if I may ask?

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:05.298
To look ahead.

01:08:05.623 --> 01:08:08.467
- What brought you back?
- Looking behind.

01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:10.712
Nasty business.

01:08:10.878 --> 01:08:12.380
Still, they're all in one piece.

01:08:12.547 --> 01:08:14.049
No thanks to your burglar.

01:08:15.466 --> 01:08:17.594
He had the nous to play for time.

01:08:19.011 --> 01:08:21.390
None of the rest of you thought of that.

01:08:23.474 --> 01:08:26.398
They must have come down
from the Ettenmoors.

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:29.314
Since when do Mountain Trolls
venture this far south?

01:08:29.522 --> 01:08:31.616
Ooh. Not for an age.

01:08:32.399 --> 01:08:35.779
Not since a darker power ruled these lands.

01:08:41.658 --> 01:08:45.254
They could not have moved in daylight.

01:08:45.787 --> 01:08:48.166
There must be a cave nearby.

01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:01.099
Oh, what's that stench?

01:09:01.261 --> 01:09:04.435
It's a Troll-hoard.

01:09:04.807 --> 01:09:07.356
Be careful what you touch.

01:09:19.822 --> 01:09:22.917
Seems a shame
just to leave it lying around.

01:09:24.327 --> 01:09:26.955
- Anyone could take it.
- Agreed.

01:09:27.121 --> 01:09:28.794
- Nori.
- Yeah?

01:09:28.956 --> 01:09:30.332
Get a shovel.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.648
These swords were not made by any Troll.

01:09:55.650 --> 01:09:59.871
Nor were they made
by any smith among Men.

01:10:04.617 --> 01:10:06.665
These were forged in Gondolin...

01:10:06.828 --> 01:10:10.332
...by the High Elves of the First Age.

01:10:10.832 --> 01:10:13.051
You could not wish for a finer blade.

01:10:27.056 --> 01:10:28.854
- Set it down.
- That's good.

01:10:29.809 --> 01:10:31.482
All right, come on. Quick.

01:10:39.819 --> 01:10:42.493
We're making a long-term deposit.

01:10:43.114 --> 01:10:44.715
Let's get out of this foul place.

01:10:45.158 --> 01:10:46.785
Come on, let's go.

01:10:46.993 --> 01:10:48.961
Bofur, Gloin, Nori.

01:11:08.431 --> 01:11:10.149
- Bilbo.
- Hmm?

01:11:11.642 --> 01:11:12.643
Here.

01:11:12.852 --> 01:11:15.401
This is about your size.

01:11:21.068 --> 01:11:22.445
I can't take this.

01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:24.788
The blade is of Elvish make...

01:11:24.989 --> 01:11:29.961
...which means it will glow blue
when Orcs or Goblins are nearby.

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:33.464
I have never used a sword in my life.

01:11:33.623 --> 01:11:35.591
And I hope you never have to.

01:11:36.542 --> 01:11:38.215
But if you do, remember this:

01:11:39.629 --> 01:11:44.931
True courage is about knowing
not when to take a life...

01:11:45.593 --> 01:11:47.812
...but when to spare one.

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:54.689
Something's coming!

01:11:54.852 --> 01:11:56.980
- Gandalf.
- Stay together!

01:11:57.814 --> 01:12:01.193
Hurry now! Arm yourselves!

01:12:19.001 --> 01:12:22.380
Thieves! Fire! Murder!

01:12:24.048 --> 01:12:25.925
Radagast.

01:12:26.467 --> 01:12:28.344
It's Radagast the Brown.

01:12:28.553 --> 01:12:30.180
Well...

01:12:32.473 --> 01:12:34.146
What on earth are you doing here?

01:12:34.308 --> 01:12:35.855
I was looking for you, Gandalf.

01:12:36.018 --> 01:12:37.395
Something’s wrong.

01:12:37.562 --> 01:12:39.690
Something’s terribly wrong.

01:12:39.856 --> 01:12:41.028
Yes?

01:12:43.526 --> 01:12:44.778
Oh.

01:12:46.487 --> 01:12:48.410
Just give me a minute.

01:12:48.656 --> 01:12:51.626
Oh. I had a thought and now I've lost it.

01:12:51.742 --> 01:12:55.212
It was right there on the tip of my tongue.

01:12:55.913 --> 01:12:58.917
Oh. It's not a thought at all.

01:12:59.166 --> 01:13:01.214
It's a silly old...

01:13:01.961 --> 01:13:03.929
...stick insect.

01:13:07.842 --> 01:13:11.597
The Greenwood is sick, Gandalf.

01:13:12.096 --> 01:13:14.224
A darkness has fallen over it.

01:13:14.432 --> 01:13:16.434
Nothing grows anymore.

01:13:16.851 --> 01:13:18.899
At least, nothing good.

01:13:19.061 --> 01:13:21.735
The air is foul with decay.

01:13:21.898 --> 01:13:23.696
But worse are the webs.

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:26.028
Webs? What do you mean?

01:13:26.193 --> 01:13:28.287
Spiders, Gandalf.

01:13:28.487 --> 01:13:29.909
Giant ones.

01:13:30.072 --> 01:13:34.418
Some kind of spawn of Ungoliant,
or I am not a Wizard.

01:13:34.744 --> 01:13:36.792
I followed their trail.

01:13:36.954 --> 01:13:39.798
They came from Dol Guldur.

01:13:40.875 --> 01:13:42.422
Huh?

01:13:42.752 --> 01:13:44.754
Dol Guldur?

01:13:44.921 --> 01:13:48.141
But the old fortress is abandoned.

01:13:49.008 --> 01:13:50.760
No, Gandalf.

01:13:52.219 --> 01:13:54.096
'Tis not.

01:14:02.313 --> 01:14:05.112
<i>A dark power dwells in there...</i>

01:14:05.316 --> 01:14:08.991
<i>...such as I have never felt before.</i>

01:14:10.529 --> 01:14:14.830
<i>It is the shadow of an ancient horror.</i>

01:14:20.957 --> 01:14:24.302
<i>One that can summon the spirits...</i>

01:14:25.044 --> 01:14:27.092
<i>...of the dead.</i>

01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:44.488
<i>I saw him, Gandalf.</i>

01:14:45.648 --> 01:14:48.276
<i>From out of the darkness...</i>

01:14:48.693 --> 01:14:51.822
<i>...a Necromancer has come.</i>

01:14:52.655 --> 01:14:54.874
Radagast.

01:15:00.287 --> 01:15:02.039
Quick! Quick, quick! Quick, quick!

01:15:04.959 --> 01:15:06.632
Wait for me!

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:21.566
Sorry.

01:15:21.726 --> 01:15:24.149
Try a little Old Toby.

01:15:24.311 --> 01:15:25.858
It'll help settle your nerves.

01:15:29.442 --> 01:15:30.489
And out.

01:15:38.242 --> 01:15:42.713
Now, a Necromancer. Are you sure?

01:15:56.343 --> 01:15:57.845
That is not...

01:15:58.054 --> 01:16:02.104
...from the world of the living.

01:16:08.022 --> 01:16:10.821
Was that a wolf?
Are there wolves out there?

01:16:10.941 --> 01:16:13.911
Wolves? No, that is not a wolf.

01:16:19.366 --> 01:16:20.834
Kili! Get your bow!

01:16:28.125 --> 01:16:29.593
Warg scouts.

01:16:29.752 --> 01:16:32.926
- Which means an Orc pack is not far behind.
- Orc pack?

01:16:33.089 --> 01:16:35.933
Who did you tell about your quest
beyond your kin?

01:16:36.092 --> 01:16:37.935
- No one.
- Who did you tell?

01:16:38.094 --> 01:16:39.437
No one, I swear.

01:16:40.221 --> 01:16:41.939
What in Durin's name is going on?

01:16:42.098 --> 01:16:43.270
You are being hunted.

01:16:44.433 --> 01:16:47.312
- We have to get out of here.
- We can't. We have no ponies.

01:16:48.813 --> 01:16:50.440
They bolted.

01:16:50.606 --> 01:16:51.949
I'll draw them off.

01:16:52.149 --> 01:16:55.073
These are Gundabad Wargs.
They will outrun you.

01:16:55.236 --> 01:16:57.159
These are Rhosgobel rabbits.

01:16:58.322 --> 01:17:01.576
I'd like to see them try.

01:17:10.167 --> 01:17:12.420
Come on! Come on!

01:17:12.628 --> 01:17:14.881
Come and get me! Ha, ha!

01:17:24.181 --> 01:17:25.854
Come on.

01:17:53.711 --> 01:17:54.837
Stay together.

01:17:55.004 --> 01:17:56.051
Move!

01:18:07.224 --> 01:18:09.727
Ori, no! Get back.

01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:14.232
All of you, come on. Quick!

01:18:17.526 --> 01:18:19.494
Where are you leading us?

01:19:27.972 --> 01:19:29.098
Move!

01:19:29.265 --> 01:19:30.437
Run!

01:19:47.449 --> 01:19:48.951
There they are!

01:19:50.619 --> 01:19:52.917
This way! Quickly!

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:05.677
There's more coming!

01:20:06.802 --> 01:20:09.976
Kili! Shoot them!

01:20:13.767 --> 01:20:15.314
We're surrounded!

01:20:19.648 --> 01:20:21.116
Where's Gandalf?

01:20:21.275 --> 01:20:23.448
He's abandoned us.

01:20:29.533 --> 01:20:31.831
Hold your ground!

01:20:41.253 --> 01:20:42.379
This way, you fools!

01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:44.506
Come on, move!

01:20:46.925 --> 01:20:48.802
Quickly! All of you!

01:20:49.011 --> 01:20:50.354
Come on!

01:20:50.929 --> 01:20:52.226
Go, go, go!

01:21:02.983 --> 01:21:04.860
Eight, nine, 10.

01:21:06.236 --> 01:21:08.204
Kili! Run!

01:21:48.362 --> 01:21:49.705
Elves.

01:21:52.574 --> 01:21:56.499
I cannot see where the pathway leads.
Do we follow it or not?

01:21:56.703 --> 01:21:58.580
Follow it, of course.

01:22:01.792 --> 01:22:03.965
I think that would be wise.

01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:06.297
Come on now, brother.

01:23:01.685 --> 01:23:04.985
The Valley of Imladris.

01:23:05.564 --> 01:23:09.444
In the common tongue,
it's known by another name.

01:23:09.818 --> 01:23:11.786
Rivendell.

01:23:14.031 --> 01:23:18.958
Here lies the Last Homely House
East of the Sea.

01:23:20.204 --> 01:23:22.798
This was your plan all along.

01:23:23.332 --> 01:23:25.380
To seek refuge with our enemy.

01:23:25.542 --> 01:23:28.887
You have no enemies here,
Thorin Oakenshield.

01:23:29.087 --> 01:23:32.967
The only ill will to be found in this
valley is that which you bring yourself.

01:23:34.301 --> 01:23:37.475
You think the Elves will give our quest
their blessing?

01:23:38.639 --> 01:23:40.061
They will try to stop us.

01:23:40.265 --> 01:23:44.190
Of course they will. But we have questions
that need to be answered.

01:23:47.814 --> 01:23:51.364
If we are to be successful,
this will need to be handled with tact.

01:23:51.527 --> 01:23:52.870
And respect.

01:23:53.070 --> 01:23:55.573
And no small degree of charm.

01:23:55.781 --> 01:23:59.786
<i>Which is why you will leave the talking
to me.</i>

01:24:56.258 --> 01:24:58.010
Mithrandir.

01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:01.263
Ah. Lindir.

01:25:01.471 --> 01:25:03.064
Stay sharp.

01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:08.403
I must speak with Lord Elrond.

01:25:08.604 --> 01:25:10.527
My Lord Elrond is not here.

01:25:11.064 --> 01:25:12.782
Not here?

01:25:13.775 --> 01:25:14.776
Where is he?

01:25:29.499 --> 01:25:31.217
Close ranks!

01:25:55.275 --> 01:25:58.620
- Gandalf.
- Lord Elrond.

01:26:15.379 --> 01:26:19.475
Strange for Orcs to come
so close to our borders.

01:26:19.633 --> 01:26:23.638
Something or someone
has drawn them near.

01:26:23.804 --> 01:26:26.102
That may have been us.

01:26:31.144 --> 01:26:34.489
Welcome, Thorin, son of Thrain.

01:26:34.648 --> 01:26:37.026
I do not believe we have met.

01:26:37.567 --> 01:26:40.616
You have your grandfather's bearing.

01:26:40.779 --> 01:26:43.248
I knew Thror
when he ruled Under the Mountain.

01:26:43.490 --> 01:26:46.710
Indeed? He made no mention of you.

01:26:57.921 --> 01:27:00.219
What is he saying?

01:27:00.382 --> 01:27:02.851
Does he offer us insult?

01:27:03.009 --> 01:27:06.684
No, Master Gloin, he's offering you food.

01:27:13.353 --> 01:27:16.948
Well, in that case, lead on.

01:27:17.899 --> 01:27:18.991
Hey. Come on.

01:27:19.192 --> 01:27:22.116
Try it. Just a mouthful.

01:27:22.279 --> 01:27:23.872
I don't like green food.

01:27:25.031 --> 01:27:26.078
Where's the meat?

01:27:27.701 --> 01:27:29.203
Have they got any chips?

01:27:30.412 --> 01:27:32.631
Kind of you to invite us.

01:27:32.789 --> 01:27:34.416
Not really dressed for dinner.

01:27:34.583 --> 01:27:35.800
Well, you never are.

01:27:56.563 --> 01:28:00.659
This is <i>Orcrist,</i> the Goblin-cleaver.

01:28:00.817 --> 01:28:02.444
A famous blade...

01:28:02.611 --> 01:28:08.493
...forged by the High Elves of the West,
my kin.

01:28:08.658 --> 01:28:10.626
May it serve you well.

01:28:10.744 --> 01:28:13.167
And this is <i>Glamdring...</i>

01:28:14.831 --> 01:28:18.631
...the Foehammer.
Sword of the King of Gondolin.

01:28:18.835 --> 01:28:21.304
These were made for the Goblin Wars
of the First Age.

01:28:21.421 --> 01:28:26.302
I wouldn't bother, laddie. Swords are
named for the great deeds they do in war.

01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:28.763
What are you saying,
my sword hasn't seen battle?

01:28:29.304 --> 01:28:31.272
I'm not actually sure it is a sword.

01:28:32.724 --> 01:28:34.647
More of a letter opener, really.

01:28:35.727 --> 01:28:37.149
How did you come by these?

01:28:37.312 --> 01:28:40.282
We found them in a Troll-hoard
on the Great East Road...

01:28:41.149 --> 01:28:44.369
...shortly before we were
ambushed by Orcs.

01:28:44.611 --> 01:28:49.162
And what were you doing
on the Great East Road?

01:28:50.325 --> 01:28:52.327
Our business is no concern of Elves.

01:28:52.494 --> 01:28:55.498
For goodness sake, Thorin,
show him the map.

01:28:55.622 --> 01:28:57.624
It is the legacy of my people.

01:28:57.833 --> 01:29:01.428
It is mine to protect, as are its secrets.

01:29:01.586 --> 01:29:04.135
Save me from the stubbornness
of Dwarves.

01:29:04.339 --> 01:29:07.263
Your pride will be your downfall.

01:29:07.384 --> 01:29:10.308
You stand in the presence
of one of the few in Middle-earth...

01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:14.145
...who can read that map.
Show it to Lord Elrond.

01:29:21.314 --> 01:29:22.987
Thorin, no.

01:29:32.450 --> 01:29:34.043
Erebor.

01:29:35.537 --> 01:29:39.132
What is your interest in this map?

01:29:40.542 --> 01:29:41.885
It's mainly academic.

01:29:42.544 --> 01:29:47.345
As you know, this sort of artifact
sometimes contains hidden text.

01:29:52.846 --> 01:29:55.520
You still read ancient Dwarvish,
do you not?

01:30:03.690 --> 01:30:06.068
Moon runes?

01:30:06.234 --> 01:30:07.861
Of course.

01:30:08.904 --> 01:30:10.656
An easy thing to miss.

01:30:10.780 --> 01:30:12.407
Well, in this case, that is true.

01:30:12.574 --> 01:30:15.077
Moon runes can only be read
by the light of a moon...

01:30:15.243 --> 01:30:19.669
...of the same shape and season
as the day on which they were written.

01:30:20.498 --> 01:30:22.250
Can you read them?

01:30:26.838 --> 01:30:29.933
These runes were written
on a Midsummer's Eve...

01:30:30.091 --> 01:30:34.312
...by the light of a crescent moon
nearly 200 years ago.

01:30:35.013 --> 01:30:37.812
It would seem you were meant
to come to Rivendell.

01:30:38.725 --> 01:30:40.727
Fate is with you, Thorin Oakenshield.

01:30:40.936 --> 01:30:44.782
The same moon shines upon us tonight.

01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:08.176
"Stand by the gray stone
when the thrush knocks...

01:31:08.338 --> 01:31:13.094
...and the setting sun with the last light
of Durin's Day...

01:31:13.259 --> 01:31:17.639
...will shine upon the keyhole."
- Durin's Day?

01:31:17.806 --> 01:31:21.276
It is the start of the Dwarves' new year,
when the last moon of autumn...

01:31:21.434 --> 01:31:24.313
...and the first sun of winter
appear in the sky together.

01:31:24.479 --> 01:31:26.356
This is ill news.

01:31:26.564 --> 01:31:29.113
Summer is passing.
Durin's Day will soon be upon us.

01:31:29.275 --> 01:31:30.572
We still have time.

01:31:30.777 --> 01:31:33.200
- Time? For what?
- To find the entrance.

01:31:33.363 --> 01:31:37.163
We have to be standing in exactly
the right spot at exactly the right time.

01:31:37.325 --> 01:31:41.330
Then, and only then,
can the door be opened.

01:31:41.496 --> 01:31:44.841
So this is your purpose,
to enter the mountain?

01:31:45.750 --> 01:31:47.093
What of it?

01:31:47.293 --> 01:31:50.217
There are some
who would not deem it wise.

01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:52.887
What do you mean?

01:31:54.384 --> 01:31:58.981
You are not the only guardian
to stand watch over Middle-earth.

01:33:49.666 --> 01:33:51.464
No, you did the same thing.

01:33:51.626 --> 01:33:55.927
- It's not like you didn't do it.
- Dori! Here, take that.

01:34:01.136 --> 01:34:02.809
Bombur!

01:34:09.018 --> 01:34:13.114
With or without our help, these Dwarves
will march on the mountain.

01:34:13.273 --> 01:34:16.197
They're determined to reclaim
their homeland.

01:34:16.359 --> 01:34:21.536
I do not believe Thorin Oakenshield
feels that he is answerable to anyone.

01:34:21.698 --> 01:34:23.416
Nor, for that matter, am I.

01:34:23.575 --> 01:34:27.455
It is not me you must answer to.

01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:41.013
Lady Galadriel.

01:34:41.426 --> 01:34:43.679
Mithrandir.

01:35:02.030 --> 01:35:05.751
I had no idea Lord Elrond had sent for you.

01:35:05.950 --> 01:35:07.577
He didn't.

01:35:07.911 --> 01:35:09.834
I did.

01:35:15.043 --> 01:35:16.340
Ah.

01:35:17.837 --> 01:35:19.555
Saruman.

01:35:19.714 --> 01:35:24.220
You've been busy of late, my friend.

01:35:24.385 --> 01:35:26.763
Tell me, Gandalf...

01:35:26.930 --> 01:35:32.608
...did you think these plans and schemes
of yours would go unnoticed?

01:35:32.769 --> 01:35:34.737
Unnoticed?

01:35:35.438 --> 01:35:36.815
No.

01:35:36.981 --> 01:35:39.655
I'm simply doing what I feel to be right.

01:35:39.817 --> 01:35:43.071
The dragon has long been on your mind.

01:35:43.571 --> 01:35:45.573
That is true, my lady.

01:35:45.740 --> 01:35:48.118
Smaug owes allegiance to no one.

01:35:48.284 --> 01:35:51.128
But if he should side with the enemy...

01:35:51.287 --> 01:35:54.211
...a dragon could be used
to terrible effect.

01:35:54.415 --> 01:35:55.917
What enemy?

01:35:56.626 --> 01:35:59.470
Gandalf, the enemy is defeated.

01:35:59.629 --> 01:36:04.385
Sauron is vanquished.
He can never regain his full strength.

01:36:04.801 --> 01:36:09.932
Gandalf, for 400 years
we have lived in peace...

01:36:10.098 --> 01:36:12.977
...a hard-won, watchful peace.

01:36:13.101 --> 01:36:16.105
Are we? Are we at peace?

01:36:17.272 --> 01:36:19.616
Trolls have come down
from the mountains.

01:36:19.774 --> 01:36:22.243
They are raiding villages,
destroying farms.

01:36:22.402 --> 01:36:24.700
Orcs have attacked us on the road.

01:36:24.821 --> 01:36:26.698
Hardly a prelude to war.

01:36:26.823 --> 01:36:29.121
Always you must meddle...

01:36:29.284 --> 01:36:31.286
...looking for trouble where none exists.

01:36:31.452 --> 01:36:33.796
Let him speak.

01:36:34.747 --> 01:36:39.674
There is something at work
beyond the evil of Smaug.

01:36:39.877 --> 01:36:42.380
Something far more powerful.

01:36:43.131 --> 01:36:48.513
We can remain blind to it, but it will not
be ignoring us, that I can promise you.

01:36:48.678 --> 01:36:51.522
A sickness lies over the Greenwood.

01:36:51.681 --> 01:36:54.104
The woodsmen who live there now
call it Mirkwood.

01:36:54.267 --> 01:36:56.065
And they say...

01:36:58.438 --> 01:37:01.157
Well? Don't stop now.

01:37:01.316 --> 01:37:03.660
Tell us what the woodsmen say.

01:37:03.818 --> 01:37:07.118
They speak of a Necromancer
living in Dol Guldur.

01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:10.705
A sorcerer who can summon the dead.

01:37:10.867 --> 01:37:12.335
That's absurd.

01:37:12.493 --> 01:37:15.337
No such power exists in this world.

01:37:15.496 --> 01:37:19.592
This Necromancer is nothing more
than a mortal man.

01:37:19.917 --> 01:37:22.420
A conjurer dabbling in black magic.

01:37:22.587 --> 01:37:24.214
And so I thought too.

01:37:24.380 --> 01:37:27.805
- But Radagast has seen...
- Radagast?

01:37:28.134 --> 01:37:31.354
Do not speak to me
of Radagast the Brown.

01:37:31.554 --> 01:37:33.352
He's a foolish fellow.

01:37:33.556 --> 01:37:37.777
Well, he's odd, I grant you.
He lives a solitary life.

01:37:37.935 --> 01:37:42.315
It's not that. It's his excessive
consumption of mushrooms.

01:37:42.857 --> 01:37:46.862
They've addled his brain
and yellowed his teeth.

01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:48.742
I've warned him.

01:37:48.863 --> 01:37:52.208
It is unbefitting one of the Istari
to be wandering the woods...

01:37:52.367 --> 01:37:54.995
<i>You carry something.</i>

01:37:56.162 --> 01:37:59.132
<i>It came to you from Radagast.</i>

01:37:59.290 --> 01:38:02.760
<i>He found it in Dol Guldur.</i>

01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:04.837
<i>Yes.</i>

01:38:05.838 --> 01:38:07.886
<i>Show me.</i>

01:38:09.384 --> 01:38:10.556
...Listen to me.

01:38:10.802 --> 01:38:14.602
I would think I was talking to myself
for all the attention that he paid.

01:38:14.764 --> 01:38:17.108
By all means...

01:38:17.683 --> 01:38:20.732
What is that?

01:38:20.895 --> 01:38:23.614
A relic of Mordor.

01:38:34.117 --> 01:38:36.085
A Morgul Blade.

01:38:36.244 --> 01:38:39.418
Made for the Witchking of Angmar.

01:38:39.580 --> 01:38:43.084
And buried with him.

01:38:44.877 --> 01:38:46.925
When Angmar fell...

01:38:47.088 --> 01:38:50.558
...the Men of the North took his body
and all that he possessed...

01:38:50.758 --> 01:38:53.887
...and sealed it within
the High Fells of Rhudaur.

01:38:54.137 --> 01:38:57.107
Deep within the rock they buried him...

01:38:57.849 --> 01:39:01.023
...in a tomb so dark...

01:39:01.185 --> 01:39:02.812
...it would never come to light.

01:39:02.979 --> 01:39:05.482
This is not possible.

01:39:06.107 --> 01:39:08.860
A powerful spell lies upon those tombs.

01:39:08.985 --> 01:39:10.908
They cannot be opened.

01:39:11.070 --> 01:39:15.917
What proof do we have this weapon
came from Angmar's grave?

01:39:16.617 --> 01:39:19.336
- I have none.
- Because there is none.

01:39:20.621 --> 01:39:22.464
Let us examine what we know.

01:39:23.249 --> 01:39:25.468
A single Orc pack...

01:39:25.626 --> 01:39:27.924
...has dared to cross the Bruinen.

01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:31.803
A dagger from a bygone age
has been found.

01:39:31.966 --> 01:39:37.314
And a human sorcerer who calls himself
"The Necromancer"...

01:39:37.597 --> 01:39:41.727
...has taken up residence
in a ruined fortress.

01:39:42.310 --> 01:39:46.281
It's not so very much after all.

01:39:46.439 --> 01:39:51.491
The question of this Dwarvish company,
however, troubles me deeply.

01:39:51.652 --> 01:39:53.370
I'm not convinced, Gandalf.

01:39:53.529 --> 01:39:56.954
I do not feel I can condone such a quest.

01:39:57.450 --> 01:40:01.671
If they'd come to me, I might have
spared them this disappointment.

01:40:01.871 --> 01:40:04.966
I do not pretend to understand your reason
for raising their hopes.

01:40:05.124 --> 01:40:06.751
<i>They are leaving.</i>

01:40:09.378 --> 01:40:10.800
<i>Yes.</i>

01:40:12.882 --> 01:40:14.509
<i>You knew.</i>

01:40:18.262 --> 01:40:22.563
No, I'm afraid there is
nothing else for it.

01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:26.153
My Lord Elrond.

01:40:26.479 --> 01:40:29.449
The Dwarves, they're gone.

01:40:34.737 --> 01:40:36.705
Be on your guard.

01:40:36.822 --> 01:40:39.166
We're about to step over
the Edge of the Wild.

01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:42.078
Balin, you know these paths. Lead on.

01:40:42.245 --> 01:40:43.838
Aye.

01:40:49.377 --> 01:40:51.425
Master Baggins...

01:40:51.587 --> 01:40:53.965
...I suggest you keep up.

01:41:07.687 --> 01:41:10.236
- You will follow them.
- Yes.

01:41:10.439 --> 01:41:13.568
You are right to help
Thorin Oakenshield.

01:41:13.734 --> 01:41:16.954
But I fear this quest has set in motion...

01:41:17.113 --> 01:41:20.708
...forces we do not yet understand.

01:41:20.866 --> 01:41:24.746
The riddle of the Morgul Blade
must be answered.

01:41:24.954 --> 01:41:28.504
Something moves in the shadows unseen,
hidden from our sight.

01:41:28.624 --> 01:41:30.718
It will not show itself.

01:41:30.876 --> 01:41:32.628
Not yet.

01:41:32.837 --> 01:41:35.636
But every day it grows in strength.

01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:37.808
You must be careful.

01:41:42.263 --> 01:41:44.015
Mithrandir?

01:41:45.725 --> 01:41:47.819
Why the Halfling?

01:41:49.729 --> 01:41:51.731
I do not know.

01:41:54.275 --> 01:41:58.075
Saruman believes
that it is only great power...

01:41:58.237 --> 01:42:01.411
...that can hold evil in check.

01:42:01.616 --> 01:42:04.119
But that is not what I have found.

01:42:05.244 --> 01:42:08.965
I have found it is the small things...

01:42:09.123 --> 01:42:11.501
...everyday deeds of ordinary folk...

01:42:11.626 --> 01:42:14.846
...that keeps the darkness at bay.

01:42:15.379 --> 01:42:18.849
Simple acts of kindness and love.

01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:23.730
Why Bilbo Baggins?

01:42:25.848 --> 01:42:28.522
Perhaps it is because I'm afraid...

01:42:30.478 --> 01:42:32.947
...and he gives me courage.

01:42:37.693 --> 01:42:41.038
Do not be afraid, Mithrandir.

01:42:42.823 --> 01:42:44.200
You are not alone.

01:44:24.425 --> 01:44:27.178
Hey! Hold on!

01:44:33.392 --> 01:44:35.565
- Aah!
- Bilbo!

01:44:38.105 --> 01:44:41.109
We must find shelter!

01:44:41.275 --> 01:44:42.697
Look out!

01:44:48.365 --> 01:44:49.958
Look out, brother!

01:44:50.785 --> 01:44:52.332
Hold on!

01:44:56.207 --> 01:44:57.800
This is no thunderstorm.

01:44:58.334 --> 01:45:00.837
It's a thunder-battle!

01:45:01.670 --> 01:45:03.388
Look!

01:45:07.718 --> 01:45:09.686
Well, bless me.

01:45:09.887 --> 01:45:11.685
The legends are true.

01:45:11.847 --> 01:45:15.818
Giants! Stone-Giants!

01:45:22.399 --> 01:45:24.948
Take cover, you fool!

01:45:25.820 --> 01:45:27.618
Hold on!

01:45:35.871 --> 01:45:38.465
- What's happening?
- Grab my hand!

01:46:02.231 --> 01:46:05.201
- Go, go, go!
- Run! Get off! Get off!

01:46:09.530 --> 01:46:12.158
- Run!
- Look out!

01:46:17.204 --> 01:46:18.626
Look out!

01:46:38.976 --> 01:46:40.569
Jump!

01:46:40.769 --> 01:46:41.861
Come on!

01:46:45.900 --> 01:46:47.368
Hold on!

01:46:55.451 --> 01:46:57.624
No!

01:46:57.745 --> 01:46:59.338
No!

01:47:08.088 --> 01:47:10.557
No! Kili!

01:47:16.472 --> 01:47:18.725
It's all right! They're alive!

01:47:20.476 --> 01:47:22.820
Where's Bilbo? Where's the Hobbit?

01:47:24.313 --> 01:47:25.610
There!

01:47:28.567 --> 01:47:29.944
Get him!

01:47:30.819 --> 01:47:31.820
Aah!

01:47:32.071 --> 01:47:34.369
- Grab my hand!
- Bilbo!

01:47:35.699 --> 01:47:38.168
- Ori, be careful!
- Take it!

01:47:38.327 --> 01:47:40.796
- I've got you, lad.
- Grab on! Grab on!

01:47:51.006 --> 01:47:53.850
Come on. Get him.

01:47:54.009 --> 01:47:55.682
Come on, lad. Up you get.

01:47:58.931 --> 01:48:01.275
I thought we'd lost our burglar.

01:48:01.767 --> 01:48:04.270
He's been lost ever since he left home.

01:48:05.145 --> 01:48:06.988
He should never have come.

01:48:07.189 --> 01:48:09.112
He has no place amongst us.

01:48:10.985 --> 01:48:12.783
Dwalin!

01:48:18.742 --> 01:48:21.291
- It looks safe enough.
- Search to the back.

01:48:21.745 --> 01:48:24.544
Caves in the mountain
are seldom unoccupied.

01:48:28.043 --> 01:48:30.011
There's nothing here.

01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:33.974
Right, then. Let's get a fire started.

01:48:34.174 --> 01:48:37.053
No. No fires. Not in this place.

01:48:37.219 --> 01:48:38.937
Get some sleep.

01:48:39.096 --> 01:48:41.565
We start at first light.

01:48:41.807 --> 01:48:45.482
We were to wait in the mountains
until Gandalf joined us.

01:48:45.644 --> 01:48:48.614
- That was the plan.
- Plans change.

01:48:48.814 --> 01:48:52.284
Bofur, take the first watch.

01:50:06.642 --> 01:50:08.394
Where do you think you're going?

01:50:11.522 --> 01:50:12.819
Back to Rivendell.

01:50:13.941 --> 01:50:16.239
No, no, you can't turn back now, eh?

01:50:16.485 --> 01:50:19.409
You're part of the company.
You're one of us.

01:50:19.571 --> 01:50:21.539
I'm not, though, am I?

01:50:22.908 --> 01:50:26.208
Thorin said I should never have come
and he was right.

01:50:26.411 --> 01:50:30.507
I'm not a Took, I'm a Baggins.
I don't know what I was thinking.

01:50:31.667 --> 01:50:35.763
- I should never have run out my door.
- You're homesick. I understand.

01:50:35.921 --> 01:50:38.390
No, you don't. You don't understand.
None of you do.

01:50:38.590 --> 01:50:41.309
You're Dwarves.
You're used to this life.

01:50:41.510 --> 01:50:45.265
To living on the road, never settling
in one place, not belonging anywhere!

01:50:49.393 --> 01:50:50.940
Oh, I am sorry. I didn't...

01:50:56.608 --> 01:50:58.406
No, you're right.

01:51:01.655 --> 01:51:03.657
We don't belong anywhere.

01:51:11.832 --> 01:51:14.085
I wish you all the luck in the world.

01:51:17.337 --> 01:51:19.055
I really do.

01:51:23.177 --> 01:51:24.554
What's that?

01:51:26.805 --> 01:51:28.148
Hmm?

01:51:47.034 --> 01:51:49.082
Wake up! Wake up!

01:51:49.369 --> 01:51:50.416
Whoa!

01:52:13.060 --> 01:52:14.778
Look out! Look out!

01:52:18.023 --> 01:52:19.696
Get away!

01:52:23.779 --> 01:52:25.281
Filthy scum!

01:52:25.447 --> 01:52:27.541
Get back!

01:52:31.245 --> 01:52:33.168
You'll pay for this!

01:52:39.503 --> 01:52:41.551
Got you.

01:52:41.797 --> 01:52:44.300
All right, all right. Don't push.

01:52:46.093 --> 01:52:48.937
Get off! Get your hands off me!
Get off me!

01:52:54.476 --> 01:52:56.444
Get off me!

01:54:43.418 --> 01:54:48.845
Who would be so bold
as to come armed into my kingdom?

01:54:49.007 --> 01:54:52.511
Spies? Thieves? Assassins?

01:54:52.677 --> 01:54:54.395
Dwarves, You r Malevolence.

01:54:54.554 --> 01:54:56.272
Dwarves?

01:54:56.431 --> 01:54:58.183
We found them on the Front Porch.

01:54:58.392 --> 01:55:02.738
Well, don't just stand there. Search them.

01:55:02.896 --> 01:55:05.445
Every crack. Every crevice.

01:55:11.029 --> 01:55:13.407
What are you doing in these parts?

01:55:14.491 --> 01:55:16.744
Speak!

01:55:18.412 --> 01:55:23.964
Very well. If they will not talk,
we'll make them squawk.

01:55:24.126 --> 01:55:25.628
Bring up the mangler.

01:55:25.794 --> 01:55:28.638
Bring up the bonebreaker.

01:55:28.839 --> 01:55:31.888
- Start with the youngest.
- Wait!

01:55:34.469 --> 01:55:37.769
Well, well, well.

01:55:37.931 --> 01:55:40.434
Look who it is.

01:55:41.184 --> 01:55:44.688
Thorin, son of Thrain, son of Thror...

01:55:45.397 --> 01:55:48.571
...King Under the Mountain.

01:55:49.401 --> 01:55:53.406
Oh, but I'm forgetting.
You don't have a mountain.

01:55:53.572 --> 01:55:55.165
And you're not a king...

01:55:55.365 --> 01:55:59.711
...which makes you nobody, really.

01:56:03.123 --> 01:56:07.970
I know someone who would
pay a pretty price for your head.

01:56:08.837 --> 01:56:10.760
Just a head.

01:56:10.922 --> 01:56:12.640
Nothing attached.

01:56:13.842 --> 01:56:17.517
Perhaps you Know of whom I speak.

01:56:17.721 --> 01:56:20.474
An old enemy of yours.

01:56:22.809 --> 01:56:27.440
A pale Orc, astride a white Warg.

01:56:28.899 --> 01:56:32.199
Azog the Defiler was destroyed.

01:56:34.488 --> 01:56:36.786
He was slain in battle long ago.

01:56:37.032 --> 01:56:40.832
So you think his defiling days are done,
do you?

01:56:42.871 --> 01:56:45.374
Send word to the pale Orc.

01:56:45.540 --> 01:56:49.044
Tell him I have found his prize.

If Baggins loses, we eats it whole.

02:03:13.011 --> 02:03:14.684
Fair enough.

02:03:18.933 --> 02:03:20.401
Well, Baggins first.

It's wind. Of course it is.

02:04:38.805 --> 02:04:41.775
Very clever, Hobbitses.

Birds, beasts... Beasts?
Trees, flowers.

02:06:21.074 --> 02:06:22.496
I don't know this one.

02:06:22.658 --> 02:06:25.878
Is it tasty?

02:06:26.037 --> 02:06:30.417
Is it scrumptious?

02:06:30.583 --> 02:06:32.085
Is it crunchable?

The answer is time.

02:07:03.533 --> 02:07:04.955
Actually it wasn't that hard.

02:07:07.411 --> 02:07:08.628
Last question.

02:07:10.414 --> 02:07:12.166
Last chance.

02:07:12.333 --> 02:07:14.006
Okay.

02:07:16.504 --> 02:07:18.506
Ask us.

02:07:19.757 --> 02:07:22.476
- Ask us!
- Yes, yes. All right.

02:07:26.722 --> 02:07:31.068
What have I got in my pocket?

That's no fair.

02:07:36.691 --> 02:07:39.820
It's not fair! It's against the rules!

02:07:41.821 --> 02:07:43.198
Now ask us another one.

02:07:43.656 --> 02:07:44.953
No. No, no, no.

02:07:45.116 --> 02:07:49.041
You said ask me a question.
Well, that is my question.

What have I got in my pocket?

02:07:53.499 --> 02:07:56.548
Three guesses, precious.
It must give us three!

02:07:56.836 --> 02:07:59.089
Three guesses. Very well, guess away.

02:07:59.255 --> 02:08:00.472
Handses!

02:08:00.673 --> 02:08:02.346
Wrong. Guess again.

02:08:03.843 --> 02:08:07.939
Fishbones, Goblins' teeth,
wet shells, bats' wings...

String. Or nothing.

Two guesses at once.
Wrong both times.

02:08:24.864 --> 02:08:26.366
So...

02:08:27.867 --> 02:08:31.417
Come, then. I won the game.
You promised to show me the way out.

02:08:32.121 --> 02:08:35.000
Did we say so, precious?

02:08:35.166 --> 02:08:38.340
Did we say so?

02:08:41.380 --> 02:08:45.931
What has it got in its pocketses?

02:08:47.220 --> 02:08:48.847
That's no concern of yours.

I know that sword!
It is the Goblin-cleaver!

02:10:52.219 --> 02:10:53.516
The Biter!

02:10:53.971 --> 02:10:57.191
The blade that sliced 1000 necks!

02:10:57.391 --> 02:11:01.316
Slash them! Beat them! Kill them!

02:11:01.479 --> 02:11:03.197
Kill them all!

02:11:03.356 --> 02:11:04.983
Cut off his head!

02:11:35.096 --> 02:11:37.269
Take up arms.

02:11:37.973 --> 02:11:39.225
Fight.

02:11:40.601 --> 02:11:41.898
Fight!

02:11:48.734 --> 02:11:51.704
He wields the Foehammer! The Beater!

02:11:51.946 --> 02:11:54.074
Bright as daylight!

02:12:03.499 --> 02:12:04.751
Thorin!

02:12:18.222 --> 02:12:20.316
Follow me. Quick!

02:12:23.727 --> 02:12:25.229
Run!

02:12:33.529 --> 02:12:35.657
Give it to us!

02:12:54.967 --> 02:12:57.891
It's ours.

02:12:58.053 --> 02:13:01.603
It's ours!

02:13:25.289 --> 02:13:27.838
Thief!

02:13:28.918 --> 02:13:32.047
Baggins!

02:13:38.219 --> 02:13:40.688
Quickly!

02:13:41.347 --> 02:13:43.315
Faster!

02:13:53.150 --> 02:13:54.493
Post!

02:13:57.071 --> 02:13:58.197
Charge!

02:14:45.119 --> 02:14:46.587
Cut the ropes!

02:15:09.685 --> 02:15:10.902
Come on, quickly!

02:15:11.061 --> 02:15:13.063
- Come on, move!
- Bombur!

02:15:19.445 --> 02:15:21.493
Go, go, go!

02:15:24.992 --> 02:15:26.414
Jump!

02:15:32.166 --> 02:15:33.463
Jump, lad!

02:15:53.979 --> 02:15:54.980
Come on!

02:15:57.608 --> 02:15:58.985
Push!

02:16:17.878 --> 02:16:19.801
Come on!

02:16:25.511 --> 02:16:26.979
Come on!

02:16:32.558 --> 02:16:36.314
- Watch your backs!
- You thought you could escape me.

02:16:39.941 --> 02:16:42.411
What are you going to do now, Wizard?

02:16:50.869 --> 02:16:52.666
That'll do it.

02:17:27.364 --> 02:17:29.867
Well, that could have been worse.

02:17:30.743 --> 02:17:32.120
Haver!

02:17:32.286 --> 02:17:34.914
You've got to be joking!

02:17:40.878 --> 02:17:42.299
Gandalf!

02:17:46.884 --> 02:17:49.102
There's too many. We can't fight them.

02:17:49.261 --> 02:17:51.308
Only one thing will save us, daylight!

02:17:51.513 --> 02:17:54.517
Come on! Here! On your feet.

02:17:57.059 --> 02:17:59.279
- Balin.
- Come on!

02:18:01.231 --> 02:18:02.483
Wait!

02:18:02.648 --> 02:18:06.119
My precious. Wait!

02:18:06.320 --> 02:18:09.119
Gollum, gollum!

02:18:13.494 --> 02:18:15.588
Quick, quick!

02:18:17.581 --> 02:18:18.628
This way.

02:18:21.376 --> 02:18:24.471
- Come on.
- Come on, come on. Quickly.

02:18:27.132 --> 02:18:28.850
Right, good!

02:19:55.888 --> 02:19:57.231
Baggins!

02:19:58.599 --> 02:20:00.567
Thief!

02:20:01.435 --> 02:20:05.941
Curse it and crush it!
We hates it forever!

02:20:18.577 --> 02:20:21.706
Five, six, seven, eight.

02:20:22.205 --> 02:20:24.458
Bifur. Bofur. That's 10.

02:20:24.583 --> 02:20:27.132
Fili, Kili! That's 12.

02:20:27.461 --> 02:20:30.635
And Bombur. That makes 13.

02:20:30.839 --> 02:20:32.887
Where's Bilbo?

02:20:33.467 --> 02:20:35.595
Where is our Hobbit?

02:20:36.678 --> 02:20:38.180
Where is our Hobbit?

02:20:39.848 --> 02:20:42.647
Curse that Halfling! Now he's lost?

02:20:42.809 --> 02:20:44.152
I thought he was with Dori!

02:20:44.311 --> 02:20:47.406
- Don't blame me!
- Well, where did you last see him?

02:20:47.564 --> 02:20:50.283
I think I saw him slip away
when they first collared us.

02:20:50.442 --> 02:20:51.864
And what happened, exactly?

02:20:51.985 --> 02:20:54.329
- Tell me!
- I'll tell you what happened.

02:20:54.488 --> 02:20:57.332
Master Baggins saw his chance
and he took it.

02:20:58.241 --> 02:21:01.245
He has thought of nothing
but his soft bed and his warm hearth...

02:21:01.411 --> 02:21:03.789
...since first he stepped out of his door.

02:21:03.956 --> 02:21:06.300
We will not be seeing our Hobbit again.

02:21:06.959 --> 02:21:08.506
He is long gone.

02:21:20.931 --> 02:21:23.309
No. He isn't.

02:21:27.688 --> 02:21:29.531
Bilbo Baggins.

02:21:29.690 --> 02:21:32.489
I have never been so glad
to see anyone in my life.

02:21:34.569 --> 02:21:36.492
Bilbo. We'd given you up.

02:21:36.655 --> 02:21:38.578
How on earth
did you get past the Goblins?

02:21:38.740 --> 02:21:40.333
How, indeed.

02:21:49.501 --> 02:21:52.471
Well, what does it matter? He's back.

02:21:53.547 --> 02:21:56.391
It matters. I want to know.

02:21:58.635 --> 02:22:00.308
Why did you come back?

02:22:03.682 --> 02:22:06.777
Look, I know you doubt me.
I know you always have.

02:22:08.311 --> 02:22:11.281
And you're right, I often think of Bag-end.

02:22:11.857 --> 02:22:13.905
I miss my books.

02:22:14.651 --> 02:22:17.404
And my armchair and my garden.

02:22:18.447 --> 02:22:19.790
See, that's where I belong.

02:22:20.490 --> 02:22:22.413
That's home.

02:22:23.910 --> 02:22:26.038
And that's why I came back. Because...

02:22:28.373 --> 02:22:31.252
...you don't have one. A home.

02:22:31.918 --> 02:22:33.511
It was taken from you.

02:22:36.590 --> 02:22:39.343
But I will help you take it back if I can.

02:23:12.584 --> 02:23:14.086
Out of the frying pan.

02:23:14.252 --> 02:23:16.596
And into the fire. Run.

02:23:16.922 --> 02:23:18.720
Run!

02:23:34.064 --> 02:23:35.486
Go!

02:24:02.008 --> 02:24:03.305
Up into the trees!

02:24:03.510 --> 02:24:06.013
All of you! Come on, climb! Bilbo, climb!

02:24:06.972 --> 02:24:08.394
Quickly!

02:24:18.108 --> 02:24:19.109
They're coming!

02:24:57.647 --> 02:24:59.365
- Hang on!
- Hold on, brothers!

02:25:20.837 --> 02:25:22.305
Azog.

02:25:48.990 --> 02:25:50.742
It cannot be.

02:26:43.628 --> 02:26:45.756
It's going!

02:27:35.305 --> 02:27:36.557
Fili!

02:28:01.164 --> 02:28:02.256
Yeah!

02:28:11.383 --> 02:28:12.930
No!

02:28:19.641 --> 02:28:21.234
Oh, no.

02:28:25.688 --> 02:28:27.065
Mr. Gandalf!

02:28:32.946 --> 02:28:34.038
Oh, no, Dori!

02:29:45.059 --> 02:29:46.527
Help!

02:30:04.370 --> 02:30:07.123
No!

02:30:18.259 --> 02:30:20.808
Thorin! No!

02:33:19.148 --> 02:33:20.570
Look.

02:34:08.197 --> 02:34:09.915
Thorin!

02:35:24.816 --> 02:35:26.363
Thorin!

02:35:30.154 --> 02:35:31.155
Thorin.

02:35:48.714 --> 02:35:49.840
The Halfling?

02:35:50.925 --> 02:35:52.973
It's all right.

02:35:53.344 --> 02:35:56.598
Bilbo is here. He's quite safe.

02:36:06.482 --> 02:36:07.529
You!

02:36:11.487 --> 02:36:13.330
What were you doing?

02:36:13.489 --> 02:36:16.038
You nearly got yourself killed!

02:36:17.994 --> 02:36:20.668
Did I not say that
you would be a burden?

02:36:21.455 --> 02:36:24.504
That you would not survive in the Wild?

02:36:25.084 --> 02:36:27.007
That you had no place amongst us?

02:36:32.592 --> 02:36:36.722
I have never been so wrong in all my life.

02:36:48.691 --> 02:36:50.238
But I'm sorry I doubted you.

02:36:50.401 --> 02:36:53.280
No, I would have doubted me too.

02:36:53.446 --> 02:36:56.575
I'm not a hero or a warrior.

02:36:58.576 --> 02:37:00.328
Not even a burglar.

02:37:19.722 --> 02:37:22.271
Is that what I think it is?

02:37:37.239 --> 02:37:38.286
Erebor...

02:37:39.909 --> 02:37:41.786
...the Lonely Mountain...

02:37:41.994 --> 02:37:46.545
...the last of the great Dwarf kingdoms
of Middle-earth.

02:37:49.085 --> 02:37:51.053
Our home.

02:37:55.424 --> 02:37:56.676
A raven!

02:37:56.884 --> 02:38:00.104
The birds are returning to the mountain.

02:38:03.349 --> 02:38:07.354
That, my dear Oin, is a thrush.

02:38:08.354 --> 02:38:10.527
But we'll take it as a sign.

02:38:10.690 --> 02:38:13.944
- A good omen.
- You're right.

02:38:14.151 --> 02:38:17.280
