Block of ice to beef bourguignon

02:01.121 --> 02:02.706
Lucky things.

02:02.831 --> 02:06.335
Dad, did you know that
the ancient Greek warriors...

02:06.460 --> 02:09.338
Had to learn 44 different
ways of unarmed combat?

02:09.463 --> 02:13.091
Well, at least we've got
a two-speed hedge cutter.

02:14.635 --> 02:18.722
They were trained to kill people
26 different ways with their bare hands.

02:18.847 --> 02:22.434
Bedtime for you, Kevin. It's 9:00.

02:22.559 --> 02:24.603
And this king agamemnon,
he once fought...

02:24.728 --> 02:26.980
Go on, dear.
Your father said.

02:27.105 --> 02:29.983
- Oh, all right.
- 'The man you all love, Kenny lange.'

02:30.108 --> 02:31.777

turn that light off!

02:47.959 --> 02:49.753
It is off.

04:15.380 --> 04:18.466
What the hell
is going on up here?

04:18.591 --> 04:22.637
I told you to put that light out
and get to bed.

04:22.763 --> 04:26.016
- But...
- And no more noise!

04:36.735 --> 04:40.030
It came off just like that.
The whole thermostat.

04:40.155 --> 04:43.116
That's the toaster, the spreader
and the slicer all gone.

04:43.241 --> 04:45.577
- She's in a terrible state.
- Should've bought German.

04:45.702 --> 04:49.414
- Mum?
- It would've matched her rotissomat.

04:49.539 --> 04:53.376
- Mum, dad, can I...
- You're going to bed in good time tonight.

04:53.502 --> 04:57.589
- I was thinking of going to bed now.
- Now? Certainly not.

04:57.714 --> 05:01.468
- You must wait for your food to go down.
- I haven't eaten any food.

05:01.510 --> 05:03.512
Well, you must eat
your food.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.639
And then wait for it
to go down.

05:08.099 --> 05:11.269
Oh, no!
Not the carvery again.

05:15.607 --> 05:20.070
Oh, clear me, beryl.
Now, all I want to know...

05:20.195 --> 05:23.198
Is what famous film star
begins with "c"?

05:23.323 --> 05:25.325
Do you understand
the question, my darling?

05:27.577 --> 05:31.456
Come on, beryl. Come on. Jumbo's
gonna end up in the soufflÃ©, beryl.

05:31.581 --> 05:35.544
You've got to answer it, beryl.
Come on. Come on, beryl.

05:36.795 --> 05:40.048
- It's gone down now.
- Come on, beryl. Come on.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.676
- What?
- My supper. It's gone down.

05:42.801 --> 05:44.970
I can feel it.
Can I go to bed now?

05:45.095 --> 05:47.347
Yeah, all right.
Off you go. But no noise.

05:47.472 --> 05:49.516
- What?
- No noise!

05:49.641 --> 05:51.518
All right. Okay.

05:51.643 --> 05:55.480
No, beryl. Capetown is not a film star.

06:08.493 --> 06:13.373
Oh dear. Oh, well.
That's your money or your life.

07:00.545 --> 07:02.505
Well, it takes money.

07:02.631 --> 07:05.133
With a kitchen like that?

07:05.258 --> 07:07.552
Our kitchen's all right, isn't it?

07:07.677 --> 07:10.138
Our kitchen is light-years behind.

07:51.471 --> 07:54.391
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

07:54.516 --> 07:58.103
- Well, look at the map.
- It's not on the map.

07:58.228 --> 08:02.941
- Is he coming after us?
- I think we gave him the slip.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.487
It's him!
Run for it!

08:07.612 --> 08:10.407
- Which way?
- This way. Careful.

08:21.584 --> 08:24.462
We can explain everything, sir.

08:24.587 --> 08:28.091
It's not as bad as it looks.

08:28.216 --> 08:30.468
We just borrowed the map.

08:30.593 --> 08:34.014
Sort of got rather happy
about it, and, uh...

08:34.139 --> 08:36.349
Ran off in high spirits.

08:36.474 --> 08:38.393
Yeah, we did.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.186
Who are you?

08:41.395 --> 08:43.273
That's not him.

08:43.398 --> 08:45.442
It didn't sound
like him, did it?

08:45.567 --> 08:48.278
It doesn't even
look like him.

08:48.403 --> 08:51.114
- It isn't him.
- Let's get him!

08:58.705 --> 09:02.542
Strutter, get his torch.
Shine it right in the face.

09:02.667 --> 09:04.586
His face, dummy!

09:04.711 --> 09:07.088
It's a kid!

09:07.213 --> 09:09.549
Og, fidgit,
check the door.

09:13.595 --> 09:15.472
All clear.

09:15.597 --> 09:17.974
Strutter, the light.

09:18.099 --> 09:21.561
Just tell us how we get out of here,
keep quiet and you won't get hurt.

09:21.686 --> 09:24.439
Wh-why don't you get out
the way you came?

09:24.564 --> 09:27.150
Don't try and be smart
with me, you little creep.

09:27.275 --> 09:28.526
Yeah.

09:28.651 --> 09:32.405
If you want to play it smart,
I'll introduce you to vermin.

09:32.530 --> 09:34.699
He eats anything,
you know.

09:34.824 --> 09:38.036
I'm not trying to be smart.
I'm just trying to help.

09:38.161 --> 09:41.039
- You know, don't you?
- I don't know anything.

09:41.164 --> 09:43.124
You know,
and you're not going to tell us.

09:43.249 --> 09:45.376
I'm getting angry,
and vermin's getting hungry.

09:45.502 --> 09:46.544
I don't kno... ooh!

09:46.669 --> 09:49.380
- He's found it!
- What?

09:49.506 --> 09:52.383
- The way out.
- It's never done that before.

09:52.509 --> 09:55.178
Come on, you lot, push!

09:57.305 --> 10:01.017
Oh, no!
Not like that!

10:01.142 --> 10:04.646
Wait for me to give
the order, all right?

10:04.771 --> 10:07.565
Ready? One...

10:09.692 --> 10:13.571
Stop! Stop!
You never start on one.

10:13.696 --> 10:17.158
Who ever heard of anybody
starting anything on one?

10:17.283 --> 10:20.411
- What is it then, two or three?
- Three.

10:20.537 --> 10:24.332
" - And push!

10:24.457 --> 10:28.128
- It's him!
- He's found us!

10:31.131 --> 10:34.467
Help us! Please!
Help us!

10:39.848 --> 10:43.560
- Come on!
- Who is that?

10:45.603 --> 10:51.025
Return what you
have stolen from me!

10:51.151 --> 10:56.281
Return!
Return the map!

10:56.406 --> 11:00.577
It will bring you
great danger!

11:00.702 --> 11:03.246
Stop! Now!

11:30.148 --> 11:31.524
- Where are we?
- I'm stuck!

11:31.649 --> 11:33.151
Quick! The barn!

11:33.276 --> 11:36.154
Get under here.
Hold him, strutter.

11:40.408 --> 11:42.577
Shut up!

11:44.412 --> 11:46.289
All clear. Wally?

11:46.414 --> 11:48.333
Yeah.

11:48.458 --> 11:50.293
- Strutter?
- Yeah.

11:50.418 --> 11:52.921
- Move it. Go.
- Okay.

11:53.046 --> 11:56.132
- Fidgit?
- Yeah.

11:57.634 --> 12:02.388
Where are we?
What happened to my bedroom?

12:02.513 --> 12:04.432
Who was that man?

12:04.557 --> 12:07.477
That was no man.
That was the supreme being.

12:07.602 --> 12:09.229
You mean god?

12:09.354 --> 12:11.606
We don't know him that well.
We only work for him.

12:11.731 --> 12:15.109
Shut up!
Now, are we all here?

12:15.235 --> 12:17.987
- What?
- Og, are you here?

12:18.112 --> 12:21.241
- Yeah, he's here.
- Vermin?

12:23.826 --> 12:26.037
Vermin, will you stop eating!

12:26.162 --> 12:29.624
It's too dangerous to stay here.
He's probably still after us.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.418
So we better keep moving.
Hey, where are you going?

12:32.543 --> 12:36.297
- Hey, where are you going?
- Get him! He'll give us away.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.934
Help! Help!

13:16.129 --> 13:18.131
Farmers!

13:24.637 --> 13:27.640
Look what you've done, boy.

13:27.765 --> 13:32.228
Sorry.
What town is that?

13:32.353 --> 13:36.274
Castiglione, or what
Napoleon's left of it.

13:36.399 --> 13:40.069
- Napoleon?
- Yes. It's his city now.

13:40.194 --> 13:42.447
Come on, boy.
You come with us.

13:42.572 --> 13:44.032
No, thanks.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.451
Come with us
if you know what's good for you.

13:47.785 --> 13:50.496
You're going the wrong way.

13:55.460 --> 13:57.503
Napoleon?

13:57.628 --> 14:00.256
- Get down!
- You nearly got us caught!

14:00.381 --> 14:03.176
You silly fool.
You could've ruined everything.

14:03.301 --> 14:06.512
- Do you know where we are?
- Shut up. Of course I do.

14:06.637 --> 14:09.557
1796.
Battle of castiglione.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.267
See?

14:11.392 --> 14:13.895
Are you sure we're not
in somebody's bedroom?

14:14.020 --> 14:16.939
Look, do you want to be
leader of this gang?

14:17.065 --> 14:21.194
- We agreed no leader.
- Right. So shut up and do as I say.

14:21.319 --> 14:24.197
Now, we've got to get
into the city.

14:24.322 --> 14:27.742
We can't.
The roads are too dangerous.

14:27.867 --> 14:31.329
I've got an idea.
We can use the river.

14:31.454 --> 14:33.206
Come on!

14:46.803 --> 14:48.638
Aaaah!

15:03.653 --> 15:06.280
What are we
going to do here?

15:06.406 --> 15:09.242
- A robbery.
- Shhh.

15:09.367 --> 15:12.412
- A robbery?
- Of course.

15:12.537 --> 15:15.498
We're international
criminals. We do robberies.

15:15.623 --> 15:17.542
Shut up back there.

15:39.689 --> 15:43.526
Aim! Fire!

15:47.405 --> 15:50.491
Take aim! Fire!

16:14.348 --> 16:15.683
That's him.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.560
You're not gonna rob him?

16:17.685 --> 16:20.188
Yeah. Every single
penny he's got.

16:20.313 --> 16:23.649
- But that's Napoleon.
- And he's rich.

16:29.572 --> 16:32.366
Monsieur commander...

16:32.492 --> 16:36.120
I think that the mayor of
castiglione and his council...

16:36.245 --> 16:38.706
Would like very much
to surrender now, please.

16:38.831 --> 16:42.335
Look at that!
Look at the little fellow!

16:44.545 --> 16:49.217
With the city, we have the whole area
of western lombardy at our feet.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.427
Oh, go away!

16:51.552 --> 16:54.138
I never should've
married you!

16:54.263 --> 16:56.599
Oh, stop it!

16:56.724 --> 17:00.061
Yes! Yes!

17:00.186 --> 17:04.440
Mon commander,
they are very keen to surrender.

17:04.565 --> 17:06.483
They have been here
eight hours.

17:06.608 --> 17:09.945
Don't stand so close
to me, neguy!

17:10.070 --> 17:13.115
I've told you
about that before.

17:13.241 --> 17:15.451
You on one side
and him on the other...

17:15.576 --> 17:18.538
It's like being on the bottom
of a bloody well!

17:18.663 --> 17:20.705
Just because
you think I'm small.

17:20.830 --> 17:23.542
No, commander, you are
not small at all.

17:23.667 --> 17:27.088
No, not by any means.
Five-foot-one is not small.

17:27.213 --> 17:30.550
Yeah, five-foot-one
and conqueror of Italy.

17:30.675 --> 17:33.469
- Not bad, huh?
- Very, very good.

17:33.594 --> 17:36.472
(Puppets chattering,
gunshob

17:36.597 --> 17:40.560
- oh! Oh! Oh!
- What just happened?

17:40.685 --> 17:42.311
Where'd they... I just...

17:53.197 --> 17:55.199
Bravo!

17:58.286 --> 18:01.622
More! I want more!

18:01.747 --> 18:05.543
- I... thank you. Thank you very much.
- Encore!

18:05.668 --> 18:11.424
I wonder if you would like
to see some of our other items.

18:12.800 --> 18:16.512
We have zuzu and Benny.

18:16.637 --> 18:18.556
I

18:18.681 --> 18:20.808
fun on a unicycle.

18:23.311 --> 18:25.521
No?

18:25.646 --> 18:29.692
How about
the great rumbozo?

18:29.817 --> 18:34.614
He sing
and lift heavy things.

18:36.407 --> 18:40.536
No. How about, uh...

18:40.661 --> 18:42.413
Come on.

18:42.538 --> 18:45.124
This I think you'll like.

18:45.249 --> 18:47.209
It's very funny.

18:47.335 --> 18:50.379
The three idiots...

18:50.504 --> 18:52.632
Uh, from Latvia.

18:52.757 --> 18:58.471
It's a very funny act.
They swallow brushes.

18:58.596 --> 19:01.223
No, no!
They're all freaks!

19:01.349 --> 19:03.517
Not one of them
under five-foot-six.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.561
What kind of theatre
are you running, huh?

19:05.686 --> 19:07.563
I'm sorry, sir, but...

19:07.688 --> 19:10.107
No, no.
More of the funny show,

19:10.232 --> 19:13.569
the little puppets
hitting each other.

19:13.694 --> 19:17.990
That's what I like!
Little things hitting each other!

19:36.217 --> 19:38.386
Come on.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.600
Psst.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.604
- Huh?
- Play something like this.

19:48.729 --> 19:51.190
Tsk. Hmm.

19:56.195 --> 20:00.282
I like the wallpaper
sticks to the wall

20:00.408 --> 20:03.536
I like the seashore
sticks to the sea

20:03.661 --> 20:06.414
I like you never
get rid of your shadow

20:06.539 --> 20:10.710
I boy, you didn't
get rid of me

20:10.835 --> 20:12.712
ime

20:12.837 --> 20:17.675
I and my shadow

20:17.800 --> 20:22.263
I strolling down the Avenue

20:22.388 --> 20:25.391
I Avenue, Avenue, Avenue

20:25.516 --> 20:27.560

20:27.685 --> 20:31.605
I and my shadow

20:31.731 --> 20:35.609
- I not a soul to tell our troubles to
- please let go!

20:35.735 --> 20:38.696
I we stick together like glue

20:38.821 --> 20:42.575
I and when it's 12:00

20:42.700 --> 20:46.287
I we climb the stairs

20:46.412 --> 20:49.582
I we never, never knock

20:49.707 --> 20:52.418
I 'cause nobody's there...

20:56.797 --> 21:01.135
I me and my shadow

21:05.639 --> 21:08.559
I feeling blue I

21:16.692 --> 21:19.612
well, what do you think?

21:38.255 --> 21:40.716
Marvellous show.

21:45.596 --> 21:51.268
Young man, you stick with these boys,
you have a great future.

21:55.272 --> 21:59.276
You know, you are
the best thing...

21:59.401 --> 22:02.613
To happen to me
since this whole campaign.

22:04.198 --> 22:06.575
You know, I come
to conquer Italy...

22:06.700 --> 22:09.286
Because I thought they
were all small, you know?

22:09.411 --> 22:11.413
I heard they was
really tiny guys.

22:11.539 --> 22:14.083
Sir, I really think there
are more important things...

22:14.208 --> 22:16.126
Shut up!

22:16.252 --> 22:19.547
Don't you dare to tell me
my business.

22:21.674 --> 22:26.262
You are dismissed, you hear?
You, lucien, the rest of you.

22:26.387 --> 22:28.222
Great streaks of misery.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.432
- But sir...
- No!

22:33.727 --> 22:38.315
I'm going to have
some new generals for a bit.

22:40.317 --> 22:43.487
Alexander the great...

22:43.612 --> 22:47.241
Five feet exactly.

22:47.366 --> 22:50.160
Isn't that incredible?

22:50.286 --> 22:56.166
Alexander the great, whose empire
stretched from India to Hungary...

22:56.292 --> 23:00.296
One inch shorter than me.

23:07.219 --> 23:09.179
Oliver cromwell...

23:10.431 --> 23:14.268
The only man with any guts
in British history...

23:18.230 --> 23:20.441
Not a big man at all.

23:27.781 --> 23:31.493
Louis iv, 5' 2 1/2".

23:33.704 --> 23:36.874
Charlemagne...

23:36.999 --> 23:39.919
A dumpy little five-footer.

23:40.044 --> 23:43.756
Squat little chap.

23:51.347 --> 23:54.475
Attila the hun, 5' 1 1/2".

23:58.646 --> 24:04.318
<i>Cyrano de bergerac,
5' 3 h2â€œ.</i>

24:05.653 --> 24:10.658
Tamburlaine the great,
four-foot-nine...

24:13.827 --> 24:16.664
And three quarters.

24:26.924 --> 24:29.385
Wasn't he interesting?

24:29.510 --> 24:32.221
Strutter, wake up.
Wake up.

24:32.346 --> 24:34.556
According to this map,
there's a time hole outside.

24:34.682 --> 24:36.350
- See if you can find it.
- Right.

24:36.475 --> 24:39.186
The rest of you,
the hole disappears at 12:00, right?

24:39.269 --> 24:41.271
So let's get moving.

24:41.355 --> 24:43.732
Vermin, fidgit,
the tapestry.

24:43.857 --> 24:46.527
Hey, that's 16th century!
It's nice, isn't it?

24:46.652 --> 24:48.529
Get it!

24:49.863 --> 24:51.824
Okay.

24:57.788 --> 25:00.082
We're rich!
We're rich!

25:00.207 --> 25:02.751
Ten-hut!

25:45.627 --> 25:48.464
- Come on. We've got 30 seconds left.
- You found the time hole?

25:48.589 --> 25:50.591
- Yes.
- Let's go.

25:56.638 --> 25:59.725
Come on, Kevin.

26:12.237 --> 26:14.740
Ten-hut!

26:14.865 --> 26:16.784
About turn!

26:43.435 --> 26:46.438
- Stopl
" go! <i>'</i>

26:47.439 --> 26:50.692
thieves!
After them!

26:50.818 --> 26:53.737
Follow them!

27:19.555 --> 27:22.391
Oh, sir Vincent,
you came for me!

27:22.516 --> 27:25.561
Oh, good mistress pansy,
i could not have ridden faster.

27:25.686 --> 27:28.480
Four horses have I exhausted
this day from Nottingham.

27:28.605 --> 27:33.193
Oh, the way you leapt to my chamber,
so full of... manliness.

27:33.318 --> 27:36.029
I could scarce restrain
the rushing of my feet.

27:36.155 --> 27:39.741
These 12 long years have been
like chains that bound me.

27:39.867 --> 27:42.494
Oh. And the personal
problem?

27:43.662 --> 27:46.331
- Much, much better.
- Ohhh.

27:46.456 --> 27:50.627
And now we will ride full tilt to Dover,
and there embark for France.

27:50.752 --> 27:53.338
Oh, you don't have
to wear the special...

27:53.463 --> 27:56.383
No, no, I don't have to wear
the special... anymore.

27:56.508 --> 27:59.636
Oh, pansy.
No more worries now, pansy.

27:59.761 --> 28:01.889
- Oh.
- Oh.

28:02.014 --> 28:04.474
No. No.

28:19.323 --> 28:22.159
Hey!

28:29.416 --> 28:31.585
- Quick! Quick!
- We did it!

28:31.710 --> 28:34.213
- Your problem, Vincent.
- Forget the problem. Get me the money.

28:34.338 --> 28:39.134
We did it! We did it!

28:39.259 --> 28:42.763
I told you. You stick with me,
and you won't go far wrong.

28:42.888 --> 28:46.099
Sometimes I almost
believe you, Randall.

28:46.225 --> 28:48.685
- Hey, where are we?
- Where are we?

28:48.810 --> 28:51.730
Why, it's obvious.
We're, um...

28:51.855 --> 28:53.690
Vincent, don't
worry about a thing.

28:53.815 --> 28:56.026
I'm not worrying.

28:56.151 --> 28:59.154
- Exactly...
- In the middle ages.

29:01.657 --> 29:04.493
Hmm... in
the middle ages.

29:04.618 --> 29:08.789
Five hundred years before the man
we just robbed was even born.

29:08.914 --> 29:11.792
- Fantastic!
- Try that one in a court of law.

29:11.917 --> 29:14.211
Vermin, that is not
meant to be eaten.

29:14.336 --> 29:16.630
You never know
until you've eaten it.

29:16.755 --> 29:19.174
Is it always like this
when you've done a raid?

29:19.299 --> 29:21.635
I don't know.
We've never done one before.

29:26.431 --> 29:29.184
But I thought you were
international criminals.

29:29.309 --> 29:31.353
Going to be.
Going to be.

29:31.478 --> 29:33.855
Yeah, going to be.
Aren't we? Going to be?

29:33.981 --> 29:36.400
Especially now
that we've got you, Kevin.

29:36.525 --> 29:40.237
Hang on. He's just a kid.
He's not one of us.

29:40.362 --> 29:42.281
He knows an awful lot.

29:42.406 --> 29:45.409
Yeah, and he's bigger
than any of us.

29:45.534 --> 29:48.787
- Do you really want to join us?
- Can we really go anywhere?

29:48.912 --> 29:51.373
You name it.
If it's down here.

29:56.295 --> 29:59.339
I don't understand.
What's so special about that map?

29:59.464 --> 30:02.134
This map used to belong
to the supreme being.

30:02.259 --> 30:05.637
- You stole it?
- No. Well, sort of.

30:05.762 --> 30:08.765
He used to be our employer.
He made all the big stuff,

30:08.890 --> 30:11.518
like good and evil,
men and women, night and day.

30:11.643 --> 30:14.646
And when he did trees and shrubs,
we helped make all this.

30:14.771 --> 30:16.606
Whew, that's not bad.

30:16.732 --> 30:20.485
Yeah, and did we get
a thimbleful of credit for it?

30:20.610 --> 30:24.906
No, all we got was the sack,
just for creating the pink bunkadoo.

30:25.032 --> 30:28.201
- Pink bunkadoo?
- Yeah. Beautiful tree that was.

30:28.327 --> 30:31.204
Og designed it, didn't you? Yeah.

30:31.330 --> 30:35.584
Six-hundred feet high,
bright red and smelled terrible.

30:35.709 --> 30:40.589
As a disciplinary measure, we were
sent down to the repairs department.

30:40.714 --> 30:43.550
What?

30:43.675 --> 30:48.263
You see, to be quite frank, the fabric
of the universe is far from perfect.

30:48.388 --> 30:52.267
It was a bit of a botched job.
We only had seven days to make it.

30:52.392 --> 30:56.438
And that's where this comes in.
This is the only map of all the holes.

30:56.563 --> 31:00.400
Well, why repair them?
Why not use them to get stinkin' rich?

31:00.525 --> 31:02.652
Yeah, stinkin' rich!

31:02.778 --> 31:06.573
Lads, here's to stinkin' rich!

31:06.698 --> 31:09.451
Stinkin' rich.
Stinkin' rich.

31:09.576 --> 31:12.412
- And to Kevin!
- Yeah, Kevin!

31:12.537 --> 31:16.333
- Here's to Kevin!
- Stinkin' Kevin!

31:16.458 --> 31:18.377
Hey, hold it there.

31:18.502 --> 31:21.338
Smile.

31:21.463 --> 31:24.591
- Hey, the map.
- Yeah, the map. Don't forget the map.

31:24.716 --> 31:28.261
Hey, come on! Smile!

31:30.847 --> 31:33.767
Help! Robbers!

31:33.892 --> 31:36.770
- Hey, that's us!
- Someone's in trouble. Come on!

31:36.895 --> 31:39.272
Grab the loot.

31:43.735 --> 31:47.489
It's a bit tight.

31:50.700 --> 31:54.204
- Now, those are our sort of people.
- Yeah!

31:57.791 --> 32:01.211
Vincent! Oh!
Oh, dear!

32:01.336 --> 32:03.547
- Help!
- Come on.

32:03.672 --> 32:06.049
Oh, Vincent,
someone's coming.

32:06.174 --> 32:08.510
Help! Help I say!

32:08.635 --> 32:11.430
Oh, at last.
Oh, I say!

32:11.555 --> 32:15.392
I say, my fiancÃ© and I would appreciate
a bit of assistance.

32:15.517 --> 32:18.562
- Oh, no! The problem, pansy!
- Oh! Oh!

32:18.687 --> 32:21.440
- It's started again! Oh! Oh!
- Oh, don't worry, darling.

32:21.565 --> 32:23.483
- I say!
- I must have fruit!

32:30.699 --> 32:33.285
- Where are we?
- We've lost them.

32:33.410 --> 32:35.787
Come on.
Don't be so wet.

32:43.753 --> 32:46.756
Hey!

32:48.800 --> 32:51.428
What do we do now,
Randall?

32:53.221 --> 32:58.059
Just leave this to me, Wally.
We've just got to treat them right.

32:58.185 --> 33:01.229
What do you want,
you tatty-faced old scumbag?

33:01.354 --> 33:04.191
- What's your business, gob face?
- We're robbers!

33:04.316 --> 33:06.193
- Villainous robbers?
- The worst.

33:06.318 --> 33:08.236
- Stop at nothing?
- Nothing at all.

33:08.361 --> 33:11.072
- Steal a cup outta a beggar's hands?
- Rather.

33:11.198 --> 33:14.284
- The teeth from blind old ladies?
- Of course.

33:14.409 --> 33:17.537
- Toys from children?
- Whenever we can.

33:25.629 --> 33:28.673
Right.
Let 'em down!

33:28.798 --> 33:31.426
They always crack
in the end.

33:34.804 --> 33:36.890
Wow.

33:37.015 --> 33:40.852
Listen, I've got a few ideas
for, uh, a linkup...

33:40.977 --> 33:44.231
Between your gang
and our gang,

33:44.356 --> 33:46.441
but I only want
to talk to the boss.

33:46.566 --> 33:48.360
The boss?

33:48.485 --> 33:50.862
- The boss?
- That's right.

33:53.198 --> 33:55.534
They serious?

33:56.576 --> 33:58.453
Ohhh.

34:06.336 --> 34:08.420
All right! Do it!

34:08.547 --> 34:11.757
Anyone else wanna go?

34:13.467 --> 34:15.303
Come on, you weasels.

34:15.428 --> 34:17.806
What's this?

34:17.931 --> 34:21.560
Lose yourself, leprechaun.

34:24.353 --> 34:26.356
Move yourself, lad.

34:45.750 --> 34:48.712
- That's disgusting!
- Wait here! I'll get him!

35:00.473 --> 35:02.475
Hello. L-l'm hood.

35:02.601 --> 35:04.477
- It's Robin hood.
- Yeah.

35:05.687 --> 35:09.691
Say good morning, you scum.

35:09.816 --> 35:11.776
Good morning, scum.

35:11.901 --> 35:15.488
- Good morning. You're all robbers, then?
- The best, Mr. hood.

35:15.530 --> 35:18.950
Jolly good.
And you're a robber, are you?

35:20.035 --> 35:22.495
Jolly good.

35:22.579 --> 35:24.706
And do you enjoy
robbing, then?

35:24.831 --> 35:27.292
Well, it helps
pay the rent, sir.

35:31.588 --> 35:34.382
Jolly good.

35:34.507 --> 35:37.510
And you're a robber too?
How long have you been a robber?

35:37.636 --> 35:40.221
- Four-foot-one.
- Good lord!

35:40.347 --> 35:42.349
- Jolly good. Four-foot-one?
- Yes.

35:42.474 --> 35:46.269
Well, th-th-th-that is
a long time, isn't it?

35:46.394 --> 35:50.190
Well now, I hear you've made
a pretty good haul.

35:50.315 --> 35:52.317
Well, see for yourself, sir.

35:53.610 --> 35:57.030
Gosh! I say!

35:57.155 --> 36:00.450
Crikey! I mean,
I've been in robbing for years,

36:00.575 --> 36:03.787
but I've never seen
anything like this.

36:03.912 --> 36:07.248
Crumbs! And you acquired
all of this by yourselves?

36:07.374 --> 36:09.334
Well, it was a good day,
Mr. hood.

36:09.459 --> 36:11.670
- Jolly good day!
- It's nice, isn't it?

36:11.795 --> 36:14.589
Rather! Well, I mean,
what can I say? Thank you.

36:14.714 --> 36:17.676
Thank you all
very, very much indeed.

36:17.801 --> 36:20.345
Oh, don't ment... what?

36:20.470 --> 36:22.639
Well, I mean,
it's frightfully kind of you.

36:22.764 --> 36:25.600
The poor are going to be
absolutely thrilled.

36:25.725 --> 36:28.144
- Have you met them?
- Who? The poor?

36:28.269 --> 36:31.189
Oh, you must meet them.
I just know you'll like them.

36:31.314 --> 36:33.692
Of course, they haven't
got two pennies to rub together.

36:33.817 --> 36:38.279
But that's because they're poor.

36:43.827 --> 36:48.081
Uh, Marion, would you be so kind
as to ask the poor to come in, please?

36:48.206 --> 36:50.417
- No problem.
- Thank you so much.

36:50.542 --> 36:53.545
- Right. Come on, you lot.
- Let's just see what we've got.

36:53.670 --> 36:56.673
This is going to be
so much help in our work.

36:56.798 --> 37:00.260
No, you don't understand.
All this stuff is ours. We stole it.

37:00.385 --> 37:04.472
Oh, yes, I know, and believe you me the
poor are going to be not just thrilled,

37:04.597 --> 37:07.434
but also considerably less poor,
aren't they, redgrave?

37:07.559 --> 37:11.479
You see? What did he say?

37:11.604 --> 37:14.566
- He said, "yeah, what with Christmas
coming up and all." - Ah, jolly good.

37:14.607 --> 37:19.612
Yes, well, there we are.
Congratulations. Well clone.

37:22.490 --> 37:25.493
There we are. Well clone.
Congratulations.

37:29.372 --> 37:32.584
Ls that... ls that
absolutely necessary?

37:32.709 --> 37:35.170
What did he say?

37:35.295 --> 37:38.548
- He says, yeah, he's afraid it is.
- Ah, fine. Fine.

37:38.673 --> 37:40.675
There we are, madam.
Congratulations.

37:40.800 --> 37:42.761
- Congratulations. Jolly good.
- Thank you.

37:46.765 --> 37:50.435
Incidentally, would any of you like
to stay on and help us with our work?

37:50.560 --> 37:52.687
There's still so much wealth
to redistribute.

37:52.812 --> 37:54.522
Oh, I'd like to stay.

37:54.647 --> 37:57.317
Jolly good.
What's your name?

37:57.442 --> 38:01.362
- Uh, ke...
- Ke... what a jolly nice name.

38:01.488 --> 38:04.032
- Let me go.
- Well, never mind.

38:04.157 --> 38:07.660
Cheerio. Thank you very much.

38:07.786 --> 38:10.663
Thank you very much.

38:10.789 --> 38:13.917
Thank you very, very,
very, very much.

38:16.503 --> 38:18.797
Awful people.

38:20.507 --> 38:23.843
- This can't wait! - I'll never get a chance
to meet Robin hood again.

38:23.927 --> 38:26.638
- Any chance of a rescue?
- Stop moaning!

38:26.763 --> 38:29.682
He's obviously a dangerous man.
Unbalanced, if you ask me.

38:29.808 --> 38:32.435
Giving away
what isn't even his!

38:32.560 --> 38:34.896
That's what Robin hood
always did. Even I know that.

38:35.021 --> 38:38.691
- Oh, of course. You know it all.
- He was one of my heroes.

38:38.817 --> 38:42.570
Heroes! Heroes!
What do they know about a day's work?

38:42.695 --> 38:45.615
- Leave him alone, Randall!
- Well, it makes me sick.

38:45.740 --> 38:48.076
Anyone who's always right
makes me sick.

38:48.201 --> 38:51.454
- That's why you get on with yourself!
- Watch it!

38:51.579 --> 38:52.872
Big mouth!

38:52.997 --> 38:54.958
Horseflesh wouldn't have
got us into this.

38:55.083 --> 38:58.419
- Horseflesh is dead.
- Then give me the map. I'm taking over!

38:58.461 --> 39:01.464
Get off me! Get...

39:14.227 --> 39:17.105
So... these are
the sort of people...

39:17.230 --> 39:19.816
The supreme being
allows to steal his map?

39:21.234 --> 39:24.696
Look at them.
Stunted little proles.

39:24.821 --> 39:27.782
I wouldn't even trust them
to wipe their own noses.

39:27.907 --> 39:33.246
Oh, no, sir. It's much
too difficult for them.

39:33.371 --> 39:36.416
What sort of supreme being
created such riffraff?

39:36.541 --> 39:39.669
Is it not the workings
of a complete incompetent?

39:39.794 --> 39:42.964
But he created you,
evil one.

39:45.466 --> 39:47.468
What did you say?

39:48.720 --> 39:53.433
Well, he created you,
so he can't be totally...

39:57.562 --> 39:59.898
Never talk to me
like that again!

40:02.483 --> 40:06.571
No one created me!
I am evil!

40:06.696 --> 40:10.199
Evil existed
long before good.

40:10.325 --> 40:14.370
I made myself.
I cannot be unmade.

40:14.495 --> 40:17.749
I am all-powerful!

40:17.874 --> 40:20.376
Yeah.

40:23.463 --> 40:27.383
But why,
if that's the case,

40:27.508 --> 40:30.845
are you unable to escape
from this fortress?

40:39.479 --> 40:41.689
That's a good question.

40:41.814 --> 40:44.692
Why have I let the supreme being
keep me here...

40:44.817 --> 40:47.695
In the fortress
of ultimate darkness?

40:47.820 --> 40:50.740
- Because you...
- Oh, shut up. I'm speaking rhetorically.

40:50.823 --> 40:53.326
- Of course.
- I let him keep me here...

40:53.451 --> 40:55.870
In order to lull him
into a false sense of security.

40:55.995 --> 40:58.665
Ah, clever, clever.

40:58.790 --> 41:02.377
When I have the map,
i will be free...

41:02.502 --> 41:05.797
And the world will be different
because I have understanding.

41:05.922 --> 41:09.926
- Uh, understanding of what, master?
- Of digital watches.

41:10.051 --> 41:14.055
Soon I shall have understanding of video
cassette recorders and car telephones.

41:14.347 --> 41:17.684
And when I have understanding of them,
i shall have understanding of computers.

41:17.725 --> 41:22.313
And when I have understanding of
computers, I shall be the supreme being.

41:22.438 --> 41:25.191
God isn't interested
in technology.

41:25.316 --> 41:29.529
He knows nothing of the potential of the
micro-chip or the silicon revolution.

41:29.654 --> 41:33.282
Look how he spends his time.
Forty-three species of parrots!

41:33.408 --> 41:36.244
- Nipples for men!
- Slugs.

41:36.369 --> 41:39.664
Slugs! He created slugs.

41:39.789 --> 41:43.543
They can't hear. They can't speak.
They can't operate machinery.

41:43.668 --> 41:46.713
Are we not in the hands
of a lunatic?

41:46.838 --> 41:48.881
Sir... look!

41:49.007 --> 41:53.261
If I were creating a world, I wouldn't mess
about with butterflies and daffodils.

41:53.386 --> 41:56.806
I would have started
with lasers, 8:00 day one.

41:56.931 --> 41:59.350
Sorry.

41:59.475 --> 42:04.564
I just can't wait for a new tech...
Techno... technological dawn.

42:04.689 --> 42:07.275
Sir... look!

42:07.400 --> 42:08.693
What is it, Benson?

42:08.818 --> 42:12.655
The map, sir. The map!
They've brought it with them!

42:12.780 --> 42:17.660
- What?
- I saw the map, master, just now.

42:17.785 --> 42:21.539
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure, master.

42:21.664 --> 42:26.461
Down there!
The little one has it.

42:26.586 --> 42:28.504
The little one?

42:28.629 --> 42:33.134
This is our chance.
This is what we've been waiting for!

42:33.259 --> 42:36.512
- It will set us free.
- Shut up!

42:36.637 --> 42:41.392
If you're wrong, Benson,
my revenge will be slow and unpleasant.

42:41.517 --> 42:45.772
I will turn you inside out
over a very long period of time.

42:45.897 --> 42:49.358
Oh, thank you, master.
Thank you.

42:49.484 --> 42:53.571
Now we must bait the hook,
see if they bite...

42:53.696 --> 42:55.990
And pull them in.

42:57.575 --> 43:02.205
Stand by for mind control.

43:03.456 --> 43:05.333
What about Babylon?

43:05.458 --> 43:08.586
- Who?
- It's a city of legendary wealth.

43:08.711 --> 43:10.421
Ahh.

43:10.546 --> 43:13.424
I've got a better idea.

43:13.549 --> 43:15.259
Who said that?

43:15.384 --> 43:19.305
I've got an idea
forming in my head.

43:19.430 --> 43:22.225
You haven't had an idea
for thousands of years.

43:22.350 --> 43:27.772
There is a place where we could find
the greatest thing man could want,

43:27.897 --> 43:32.735
the goal of everybody's
hopes and dreams.

43:32.860 --> 43:36.489
What the hell
are you talking about?

43:36.614 --> 43:40.827
The most fabulous
object in the world.

43:40.952 --> 43:43.704
- That sounds like a good idea.
- Yeah.

43:43.830 --> 43:46.624
They're hooked,
the greedy little fish.

43:46.749 --> 43:48.793
Why do you always
have to go after money?

43:48.918 --> 43:50.211
Who's this?

43:50.336 --> 43:52.839
I don't know, master.
I haven't seen him before.

43:52.964 --> 43:55.341
He's stronger than the rest.
Who is he?

43:55.466 --> 43:58.219
- I don't know.
- I'm losing them.

43:58.344 --> 44:01.472
Something's going on down there.
We've lost them!

44:01.597 --> 44:03.516
Randall, look, over there!

44:03.641 --> 44:06.519
- We'd better move!
- Don't rush me.

44:06.644 --> 44:08.479
The forest!
It's on fire!

44:08.604 --> 44:11.524
It's raining,
pudding head!

44:11.649 --> 44:14.110
- Oh, no!
- What is it?

44:14.235 --> 44:15.736
- It's him!
- It's him!

44:15.862 --> 44:18.698
Return the map.

44:18.823 --> 44:20.908
- Make for the hole!
- Where is it?

44:21.033 --> 44:23.494
It's over there.
Quick! Come on!

44:23.619 --> 44:26.622
- Stop! Return!
- Hurry up!

44:26.747 --> 44:31.252
Return what you
have stolen from me.

44:31.377 --> 44:33.713
Return the map!

44:33.838 --> 44:37.300
There are two holes, Randall.
Which one? Which one?

44:37.425 --> 44:39.886
Go, Kevin!
Just get away!

44:40.011 --> 44:44.807
Go! Not that one!

46:35.876 --> 46:38.170
Where did you
come from? Huh?

46:38.296 --> 46:40.423
I'm not quite sure.

46:40.548 --> 46:42.758
Who sent you?
The gods?

46:43.884 --> 46:46.929
Was it Zeus?
Apollo?

46:47.054 --> 46:48.973
Athena?

47:01.485 --> 47:05.448
Well, you're certainly a chatty
little fellow, aren't you?

47:05.573 --> 47:08.909
I don't believe it!

47:09.035 --> 47:11.537
You don't believe what?

47:11.662 --> 47:14.832
I don't believe
the way you killed him.

47:14.957 --> 47:19.503
Yes. But it
has to be done sometimes.

47:19.628 --> 47:22.465
No. I mean it was
such a good shot.

47:22.590 --> 47:25.301
I bet you've killed
lots of people.

47:27.928 --> 47:30.431
Well, the gods must
have given you a name.

47:30.556 --> 47:32.892
Oh, yeah. Kevin.

47:33.017 --> 47:35.394
Kevin?

47:35.519 --> 47:38.773
Well, Kevin,
here, it's yours.

47:38.898 --> 47:41.776
- What?
- You don't want it?

47:41.901 --> 47:44.653
Oh, yes, please.
You mean I can really have it?

47:44.779 --> 47:47.740
Well, on condition that you
carry it back to the city for me.

47:47.865 --> 47:51.369
Oh, great. But no,
i can't really.

47:51.494 --> 47:54.455
I must wait. You see,
I'm with friends.

47:56.123 --> 47:59.752
You see, if I lose them,
i may never be able to get back.

47:59.877 --> 48:02.671
Get back? To where?

48:02.797 --> 48:05.508
I'm not really sure.

48:07.802 --> 48:10.930
Here, you better take this.
You'll need it. It's water.

48:11.055 --> 48:14.600
There's enough there for your friends,
too, if they ever turn up.

48:17.812 --> 48:20.606
Oh, and by the way,
thank you.

48:27.613 --> 48:30.574
No. Please.
I'd like to come, really.

48:30.699 --> 48:33.077
No, no, please.
I'd like to come.

48:37.498 --> 48:39.583
Better? No.

48:39.708 --> 48:42.086
I

50:05.461 --> 50:08.797
you saved my life.
Remember?

50:10.466 --> 50:13.177
The enemy of the people
is dead!

50:18.849 --> 50:21.894
Hail king agamemnon!

50:34.949 --> 50:38.619
There's a man being
cut in half here.

50:38.744 --> 50:42.414
It must have been a brilliant battle.
Choc)! Choc)!

50:42.540 --> 50:46.877
All three are to receive
summary executions today.

50:47.002 --> 50:50.422
If the queen wishes to see me,
I'll be in the courts all afternoon.

50:55.678 --> 50:59.473
Remind the queen that
i still rule this city.

50:59.598 --> 51:03.352
I wish I'd been
in the trojan wars.

51:03.477 --> 51:05.896
Will you teach me
how to sword fight?

51:08.440 --> 51:12.570
Come here. I'll teach you
something much more useful.

51:26.709 --> 51:29.378
- Where is it?
- There.

51:35.050 --> 51:37.094
That one.

51:39.471 --> 51:42.850
Kings aren't supposed
to do things like that.

52:12.421 --> 52:16.508
You know, I never, ever
want to go back.

52:18.010 --> 52:20.804
Don't you want to see
all your friends again?

52:20.929 --> 52:22.806
No, thanks.

52:22.931 --> 52:27.728
To be in your own home, to be
with your own father and mother?

52:29.396 --> 52:31.523
No.

52:31.649 --> 52:33.776
Very well, then.

52:33.901 --> 52:36.654
- I can stay?
- We'll decide that tomorrow.

54:01.321 --> 54:05.492
I have decreed that this boy
shall remain here with us in our city.

54:05.617 --> 54:09.913
Furthermore, he shall
from this day forward be my own son...

54:10.038 --> 54:12.374
And heir to the throne
of mycenae.

54:14.918 --> 54:17.588
Let the banquet begin.

56:04.987 --> 56:07.614
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

56:07.739 --> 56:10.868
a masterly miracle of modern
magic before your very eyes.

56:10.993 --> 56:13.996
Abracadee, abracadoo!

56:14.121 --> 56:16.874
You're doing a great job.

56:16.999 --> 56:19.293
If we can borrow this
for a moment, sir.

56:19.418 --> 56:22.796
Please give generously
as my assistants pass amongst you.

56:22.921 --> 56:25.549
Thank you very much.
That's very kind.

56:29.845 --> 56:32.848
Come on. Come on.

56:38.478 --> 56:42.524
- Now all we need is a volunteer. Yes,
young man, you'll do fine. - No! Please!

56:42.649 --> 56:44.568
No! Leave me!

56:44.860 --> 56:47.237
Come on!
Come on!

56:47.362 --> 56:50.324
- No way!
- May I? The crown?

56:50.449 --> 56:53.410
Don't! Help me!

56:53.535 --> 56:57.205
Kevin, let's get
out of here!

56:57.331 --> 56:58.999
No! Please, no!

56:59.124 --> 57:01.001
Thank you.

57:01.126 --> 57:04.546
- No! Please!
- Watch this!

57:04.671 --> 57:06.965
We make a great team,
don't we?

57:07.966 --> 57:09.968
Now!

57:44.753 --> 57:47.839
- Alone, at last.
- Isn't it glorious?

57:47.965 --> 57:50.425
Yes. I love the ocean.

57:50.550 --> 57:53.387
God, how I, howl love her.

57:53.512 --> 57:57.599
- She's so, so damn...
- Wet?

57:58.642 --> 58:00.519
Wet. Yes. Yes.

58:00.644 --> 58:04.940
So damn... damn... wet.

58:06.483 --> 58:08.944
Pansy.
Pansy, look at me.

58:09.069 --> 58:12.823
- Yes, Vincent?
- Do you love me?

58:12.948 --> 58:18.036
- Of course, I love you. - You don't mind
the, the thing on the end of my nose?

58:18.078 --> 58:20.664
- Oh, you mean your... no, darling.
- Yes, my...

58:20.789 --> 58:23.166
Don't be silly.

58:23.291 --> 58:25.252
Could you share a house

58:25.377 --> 58:28.046
with a chap who has a thing like this
on the end of his nose?

58:28.130 --> 58:33.093
Of course, my love.
Everyone has something odd about them.

58:33.176 --> 58:35.887
- Why, I've got an enormous...
- Pansy!

58:36.013 --> 58:38.390
Pansy, I'm so glad
you feel the way you do.

58:38.515 --> 58:41.977
Because now I can ask you
what I've always wanted to ask you.

58:42.102 --> 58:44.646
Oh, ask me.

58:44.771 --> 58:46.565
Ask me!

58:46.690 --> 58:50.944
Pansy, will you...

58:53.697 --> 58:55.532
Will you...

58:59.911 --> 59:02.581
Where the hell are we?

59:02.706 --> 59:04.833
Someone hit me! Oh!

59:04.958 --> 59:07.753
Pansy! Pansy!

59:07.878 --> 59:11.715
Give me that!

59:11.840 --> 59:14.926
You've ruined everything!
Pansy! Pansy, I can explain!

59:15.052 --> 59:18.847
It's only the thing on my nose and the
hairpiece! Everything else is fine!

59:18.972 --> 59:21.975
I

59:25.729 --> 59:27.647
fidgit, you're not supposed
to eat that.

59:27.773 --> 59:30.734
- You're supposed to drink it.
- I like that. It's very nice.

59:30.859 --> 59:32.778
Oh.

59:33.862 --> 59:36.615
Six more plates
of caviar, please.

59:36.740 --> 59:38.575
Anyone else want any?

59:38.700 --> 59:41.953
No, none for me, thank you.
I'll stick with the quail's eyeballs.

59:42.079 --> 59:44.414
The caviar makes me throw up,
you know.

59:44.539 --> 59:47.834
- Waiter.
- Sorry, Randall. Sorry.

59:47.959 --> 59:52.422
Cheer up, Kevin. Kings aren't
the only ones with money, you know.

59:52.547 --> 59:54.800
The money wasn't important
to him.

59:54.925 --> 59:57.511
He didn't have anything
to spend it on, did he?

59:57.636 --> 01:00:01.807
Stuck out in Greece... lowest
standard of living in Europe.

01:00:01.932 --> 01:00:06.853
You make me sick!

01:00:13.193 --> 01:00:16.655
What?
Things are looking better all the time.

01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:20.534
- I've got something to say to you.
- Go away!

01:00:20.659 --> 01:00:24.621
It's about the map.

01:00:24.746 --> 01:00:28.375
The map?
I don't understand you, Randall.

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:30.585
You've got something
really brilliant like that,

01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:33.380
and you're just wasting it.

01:00:33.505 --> 01:00:36.133
I wouldn't call this exactly...
Wasting it.

01:00:36.258 --> 01:00:39.469
Why couldn't you leave me
where I was happy?

01:00:39.594 --> 01:00:42.806
Because when you hear
what I've got planned,

01:00:42.931 --> 01:00:46.518
you're gonna be a lot happier.

01:00:46.643 --> 01:00:50.981
I was havin' a close look at the map
last night. Do you know what I found?

01:00:51.106 --> 01:00:55.277
Og was right.
The most fabulous object in the world.

01:00:55.402 --> 01:00:57.195
It does exist.

01:00:59.531 --> 01:01:01.449
Look.

01:01:01.575 --> 01:01:05.954
- The time of legends... - The time of
legends! There's no such thing.

01:01:05.996 --> 01:01:08.707
But there is.
You just gotta believe in it.

01:01:08.832 --> 01:01:11.042
Otherwise, horseflesh
wouldn't have put it on the map.

01:01:11.168 --> 01:01:15.380
"In the middle of the time of legends
is a fortress of ultimate darkness,

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:19.634
and inside the fortress
of ultimate darkness,

01:01:19.759 --> 01:01:22.804
the most fabulous object
in the world."

01:01:22.929 --> 01:01:24.556
Give it up, Randall.

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:26.892
Look.

01:01:27.017 --> 01:01:29.853
You and me... we got a lot in common.

01:01:29.978 --> 01:01:32.522
Not like that lot.

01:01:32.647 --> 01:01:34.816
We like a risk.

01:01:34.941 --> 01:01:37.444
We like adventure.

01:01:37.569 --> 01:01:39.863
Well, this is it.

01:01:39.988 --> 01:01:42.866
This is the big one.

01:01:42.991 --> 01:01:45.619
No namby-pamby
time holes here.

01:01:45.744 --> 01:01:50.415
We risk all.
We win everything.

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:52.876
Waiter, more champagne.

01:01:53.001 --> 01:01:55.462
Yes, sir.

01:01:55.587 --> 01:01:57.797
And plenty of ice.

01:02:18.652 --> 01:02:20.570
Hello!

01:02:20.695 --> 01:02:22.864
I want to go home!
I can't stand it!

01:02:22.989 --> 01:02:24.866
You'll get us all killed,
Randall!

01:02:24.991 --> 01:02:26.868
Stop whimpering, fidgit!

01:02:26.993 --> 01:02:29.871
How could I know we were gonna
run slap-bang into an iceberg?

01:02:29.996 --> 01:02:32.999
It didn't say "get off before
the iceberg" on the ticket.

01:02:35.502 --> 01:02:37.963
Now... now is the time...

01:02:38.088 --> 01:02:43.468
To star... to start our quest for the...
For the most fabulous object, Randall.

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:46.846
- Og's right! I've got the map.
- No!

01:02:46.972 --> 01:02:49.432
- Let's go!
- What?

01:02:49.557 --> 01:02:54.688
Randall, we are in the middle
of the Atlantic ocean!

01:02:54.813 --> 01:02:58.858
It doesn't matter where we are.
You just gotta believe in it!

01:02:58.984 --> 01:03:00.527
Youure
crazy'

01:03:00.652 --> 01:03:03.530
- we must try!
- No, don't!

01:03:03.655 --> 01:03:05.865
- Abandon plank!
- No!

01:03:05.991 --> 01:03:10.537
I can't swim!
I can't swim!

01:03:10.662 --> 01:03:12.747
Help! Help!

01:03:15.041 --> 01:03:18.878
- Don't worry, fidgit! I'm coming!
- Help!

01:03:19.004 --> 01:03:21.589
<i>'</i> - Help!

01:03:21.715 --> 01:03:25.719
- Now we have them!
- Oh, well done. Well done, master.

01:03:34.102 --> 01:03:37.564
Suddenly, I feel...
Very, very good.

01:03:37.689 --> 01:03:39.899
- I'm sorry, master.
- It'll pass. It'll pass.

01:03:40.025 --> 01:03:43.778
- Shall I bring them in, master?
- Yes, Benson.

01:03:43.903 --> 01:03:47.240
Bring them into the time of legends.

01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:21.608
Hey!
Hey, I can swim!

01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:27.697
Look.

01:04:27.822 --> 01:04:30.742
Look!

01:04:41.169 --> 01:04:42.629
Morning, dear.

01:04:46.132 --> 01:04:49.135
Ooh!

01:04:51.012 --> 01:04:54.724
- Help!
- Who's that?

01:04:54.849 --> 01:04:58.478
- What, dear?
- Thought I heard a noise.

01:04:58.603 --> 01:05:02.816
No. It's your nerves, dear.

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:05.735
Here we are, darling.

01:05:08.530 --> 01:05:10.365
Come on.

01:05:12.617 --> 01:05:16.704
And the ointment for the leg.

01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:19.290
I grew too fast
when I was young.

01:05:19.416 --> 01:05:23.586
- That was the problem.
- You've been overdoing it a bit, dear.

01:05:23.711 --> 01:05:27.424
You try being beastly and terrifying
when you...

01:05:27.549 --> 01:05:32.345
You can only get one hour's sleep
a night because your back hurts,

01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:36.057
and you daren't cough
in case you pull a muscle.

01:05:36.182 --> 01:05:38.768
But you are horrible, dear.

01:05:38.893 --> 01:05:40.854
You're just sayin' that.

01:05:43.731 --> 01:05:45.775
And gargle.

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:49.404
Come on, now. There's a good fellow.

01:05:55.702 --> 01:05:57.537
- What's that?
- I don't know.

01:05:59.497 --> 01:06:02.500
Wait for me!

01:06:05.003 --> 01:06:07.005
Look at these bloody spots.

01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:09.549
That's diet, that is.

01:06:09.674 --> 01:06:14.262
- You'll outgrow them, dear.
- Look at all this bloody fish!

01:06:14.387 --> 01:06:17.849
There used to be
a time when you could be sure...

01:06:17.974 --> 01:06:20.810
Of catchin'
old boots, cans,

01:06:20.935 --> 01:06:22.854
hat racks, boxes.

01:06:22.979 --> 01:06:25.940
Now it's prawns
all the bloody time!

01:06:26.065 --> 01:06:30.653
Anti-pollution! Wife!

01:06:32.822 --> 01:06:35.450
What d'you want, dear?
Do you want the foot powder?

01:06:35.575 --> 01:06:39.078
No! Come out here
and help me!

01:06:39.204 --> 01:06:41.664
- Quick!
- Dear.

01:06:44.125 --> 01:06:48.671
- What's in there?
- I don't know, but it's not prawns.

01:06:48.796 --> 01:06:50.798
Here.

01:06:50.924 --> 01:06:53.510
Here, dear.
Leave that to me, please.

01:06:53.635 --> 01:06:56.012
Yeah.

01:06:59.807 --> 01:07:04.395
Aren't they lovely?
We can have them for breakfast.

01:07:04.521 --> 01:07:06.606
Ah, you mean
eat their boots?

01:07:06.731 --> 01:07:10.443
No,dean
i mean, eat all of them.

01:07:10.568 --> 01:07:12.487
Every little bit.

01:07:12.612 --> 01:07:15.740
That means the big pot
and the large skewers.

01:07:15.865 --> 01:07:19.035
What shall I do, dear?

01:07:21.579 --> 01:07:23.498
Terrify them.

01:07:23.623 --> 01:07:25.792
Oh, but what about me back?

01:07:25.917 --> 01:07:28.545
Well, you don't have
to jump around.

01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:31.047
Just shout horribly...

01:07:31.172 --> 01:07:34.592
And leer at them.

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:38.054
You know,
the way you used to.

01:07:38.179 --> 01:07:40.890
Right.

01:07:41.015 --> 01:07:43.601
Right.

01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:48.231
Oh, I'm so happy
'cause I'm bus-bus-bus-busy.

01:07:49.524 --> 01:07:52.026
Right.

01:07:56.406 --> 01:07:58.283
- Go away!

01:08:03.037 --> 01:08:04.872
Let's see.
What have we here?

01:08:04.998 --> 01:08:07.250
Some tasty
little morsels, eh?

01:08:07.375 --> 01:08:09.836
Help! Get off!

01:08:09.961 --> 01:08:12.297
Hey! Put me down! Put me down!

01:08:15.592 --> 01:08:18.886
Put me down!

01:08:21.014 --> 01:08:25.893
I yes, it's wonderful
to be making a fondue again

01:08:29.647 --> 01:08:31.566
be quiet!

01:08:34.569 --> 01:08:36.446
D-d-does your back hurt?

01:08:36.571 --> 01:08:40.073
- Huh?
- I know a cure for bad backs.

01:08:40.198 --> 01:08:43.661
Bad back?
Me? An ogre?

01:08:48.750 --> 01:08:52.879
- W-what you need i-is stretching.
- Stretching?

01:08:53.004 --> 01:08:56.381
I to be melting the cheese
in the southerly breeze

01:08:56.506 --> 01:08:59.510
I to be sharpening
the skewer again I

01:08:59.636 --> 01:09:02.846
heave!

01:09:02.971 --> 01:09:04.849
That's better!

01:09:04.974 --> 01:09:08.685
That's better!
That's wonderful!

01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:12.398
Heave again!

01:09:12.523 --> 01:09:15.484
Are they in the pot, dear?

01:09:15.609 --> 01:09:17.944
Yeah. Just about.

01:09:18.071 --> 01:09:21.783
And one more for luck.
Heave!

01:09:21.908 --> 01:09:26.328
- Two, three, left, right, left, right!
- Hey, what's going on?

01:09:26.453 --> 01:09:29.290
Left, right!

01:09:32.417 --> 01:09:35.921
Are you all right, dear?

01:09:36.046 --> 01:09:38.716
- Oh! Quick! Into the pot!
- Yeah!

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:40.885
Winston?

01:09:42.553 --> 01:09:44.555
Winston!

01:09:50.269 --> 01:09:52.897
Ls this part of the cure?

01:09:55.066 --> 01:09:57.443
Winston.

01:09:57.568 --> 01:09:59.487
What are you doing
in the water, dear?

01:10:06.828 --> 01:10:11.624
Oh, my back is wonderful!

01:10:11.749 --> 01:10:14.836
You've got to stop them, Winston!

01:10:17.046 --> 01:10:19.006
I can cough!

01:10:19.132 --> 01:10:21.926
At last,
i can really cough!

01:10:28.558 --> 01:10:30.518
- Look out!
- We're going! We're saved!

01:10:30.643 --> 01:10:33.104
- Yes! To that side! Quick!
- We're saved!

01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:35.606
Catch all! Come on!

01:10:42.196 --> 01:10:45.950
- Hold on!
- Hold on tight, Wally!

01:10:50.830 --> 01:10:53.499
How're we doing now, Randall?

01:10:53.624 --> 01:10:55.543
Just fine.

01:10:55.668 --> 01:10:58.755
We're on the right course.

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:02.425
As long as this wind keeps up,
nothing can go wrong.

01:11:05.094 --> 01:11:08.890
- Keep the rudder straight, strutter.
- It is straight!

01:11:12.143 --> 01:11:15.646
All hands on the tiller!

01:11:15.772 --> 01:11:18.941
- Quick! Drop the sail!
- All right! Leave it to me!

01:11:21.068 --> 01:11:23.696
Qne!

01:11:23.821 --> 01:11:25.740
How about it? Eh?

01:11:25.865 --> 01:11:27.950
I got it.

01:11:28.075 --> 01:11:30.870
- That's it.
- That's better. We're out of that.

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:42.507
Randall! Randall?

01:11:42.632 --> 01:11:44.926
I think there's something
that you should know.

01:11:59.190 --> 01:12:01.776
Everybody below decks!

01:12:07.114 --> 01:12:09.575
- Come on! Get in here!
- Quick! Get in!

01:12:26.050 --> 01:12:27.927
- What's going on?
- You tell me.

01:13:01.836 --> 01:13:03.045
Pull these boards out!

01:13:03.170 --> 01:13:06.007
- You might sink the ship!
- Oh, shut up!

01:13:15.099 --> 01:13:17.476
- Here's a hammer!
- That's it!

01:13:17.602 --> 01:13:20.021
That's it! Now!

01:13:22.982 --> 01:13:26.193
- Do it again!
- Harder! Really hard!

01:13:28.988 --> 01:13:31.198
Oh, stop him!

01:13:35.077 --> 01:13:38.664
Drugs! Hey!
I've got an idea!

01:13:48.549 --> 01:13:50.593
Sleeping potion!

01:13:54.055 --> 01:13:55.973
Strutter, take this!

01:13:58.225 --> 01:14:00.186
Take the plug out!

01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:09.070
Here!

01:14:10.947 --> 01:14:12.823
Hey. Yeah!

01:14:12.949 --> 01:14:15.034
- Hey.
- Yeah.

01:14:15.159 --> 01:14:18.537
- Do it!
- And, heave!

01:15:22.184 --> 01:15:25.062
Hey! On!

01:15:30.651 --> 01:15:33.362
Come on! Come!

01:15:40.619 --> 01:15:42.580
Hey, what's out there?

01:15:57.219 --> 01:15:59.221
Shh! Shh! Shh!

01:16:08.647 --> 01:16:11.734
- Come on. Let's go. Run! Run!
- Quick!

01:16:30.586 --> 01:16:34.465
The fortress of ultimate darkness
is somewhere over there, I promise you!

01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:37.468
Oh, you're joking, Randall.
There's nothing over there!

01:16:37.593 --> 01:16:40.054
Look! We're so close!

01:16:40.179 --> 01:16:42.556
Y-you've been saying that
for the last 40 miles!

01:16:42.681 --> 01:16:44.725
Let's go back!
We'll all die out here!

01:16:44.850 --> 01:16:46.727
- Yeah!
- You can't give up now.

01:16:46.852 --> 01:16:49.105
- When can we give up?
- Come on. It's just a bit further...

01:16:58.823 --> 01:17:00.699
What is it?

01:17:00.825 --> 01:17:04.829
I don't know,
but it hurts.

01:17:06.038 --> 01:17:08.749
It's some kind
of invisible barrier.

01:17:08.874 --> 01:17:12.962
Oh! So that's what
an invisible barrier looks like.

01:17:13.087 --> 01:17:15.381
It's what this line
must be.

01:17:15.506 --> 01:17:17.383
And just on the other side,

01:17:17.508 --> 01:17:20.094
the fortress
of ultimate darkness.

01:17:20.219 --> 01:17:23.639
We've made it, lads!
We're here!

01:17:26.016 --> 01:17:27.893
You're mad, Randall!

01:17:28.018 --> 01:17:30.062
Your brain's gone.
Do you know that?

01:17:30.187 --> 01:17:32.398
I promise you,
this is it!

01:17:32.523 --> 01:17:34.608
We are here!

01:17:34.733 --> 01:17:37.403
- We're nowhere, Randall!
- Yeah!

01:17:37.528 --> 01:17:41.115
- Look around! There's nothing!
- Yeah.

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:43.075
There's only one way
to go now.

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:45.786
- That's right. Back! Come on.
- Right!

01:17:45.911 --> 01:17:47.830
- Come on. We're going back.
- No! Listen!

01:17:47.955 --> 01:17:49.707
- No! Stop! Stop!
- No, you don't! Get out of the way!

01:17:49.832 --> 01:17:52.543
- Listen to me!
- Get out of the way!

01:17:55.921 --> 01:17:58.591
You'll never get back
without me.

01:17:58.716 --> 01:18:00.885
Do you wanna bet?

01:18:02.928 --> 01:18:06.348
- Wally, give that back.
- Get out of the way, Randall.

01:18:06.473 --> 01:18:09.393
You give that back,
or I'll take your head off.

01:18:09.518 --> 01:18:12.021
Randall! Don't do it!

01:18:35.169 --> 01:18:37.796
We have found it!

01:18:40.966 --> 01:18:42.968
Thank you.

01:19:09.703 --> 01:19:12.373
Brilliant, evil one.

01:19:12.498 --> 01:19:15.084
- Is everything ready?
- Yes, master.

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:31.600
Fantastic.

01:19:35.062 --> 01:19:37.940
Amazing.

01:19:38.065 --> 01:19:40.776
Magnificent.

01:19:43.028 --> 01:19:44.947
Look.

01:19:54.999 --> 01:19:56.875
- Move!
- Get out of the road!

01:20:01.797 --> 01:20:06.218
Yes, folks. Moderno designs present
the latest in kitchen luxury:

01:20:06.343 --> 01:20:11.515
The moderna wonder major
all-automatic convenience center-ette.

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:16.520
And here they are... the winners of
the most fabulous object in the world.

01:20:16.645 --> 01:20:19.815
The answer to all their
problems and yours...

01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:22.901
Is here for them tonight!

01:20:23.027 --> 01:20:25.237
- Chattering)
- Hey!

01:20:25.362 --> 01:20:29.908
- Don't go! Where are you going?
- We found it!

01:20:30.034 --> 01:20:31.660
Wait! You're mad!

01:20:31.785 --> 01:20:34.288
Come back!

01:20:40.085 --> 01:20:41.962
- Let's go get it!
- Come on!

01:20:42.087 --> 01:20:45.257
Here they come!
So let's give 'em a big welcome!

01:20:45.341 --> 01:20:48.594
Trevor, Diane...
Oh, don't they look lovely!

01:20:48.719 --> 01:20:51.180
' <i>'</i> Mum!

01:20:53.724 --> 01:20:55.642
Dad!

01:20:59.188 --> 01:21:03.192
Come on. Lead us in a big hand
for the lucky winners!

01:21:05.861 --> 01:21:07.780
Come back!

01:21:07.905 --> 01:21:11.116
- It's a trap!
- Fabulous.

01:21:19.333 --> 01:21:21.502
Fabulous.

01:21:21.627 --> 01:21:24.088
Here they are.
Congratulations.

01:21:24.213 --> 01:21:28.759
But before they collect their prize, let's just
have a look at what made it possible...

01:21:28.842 --> 01:21:31.887
For them to be here
with us tonight.

01:21:32.012 --> 01:21:33.972
The map, please.

01:21:47.111 --> 01:21:50.697
Let us out!

01:21:53.158 --> 01:21:56.829
Let us out! Come back!

01:21:56.954 --> 01:22:00.874
I have the map!
I have the map!

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.586
And the day after tomorrow,

01:22:04.711 --> 01:22:06.797
the world!

01:22:06.922 --> 01:22:08.924
Oh, no!

01:22:23.730 --> 01:22:26.775
Rat, anybody?
Might be the last meal you get.

01:22:27.860 --> 01:22:29.820
No. Leave off!

01:22:32.656 --> 01:22:36.702
- That's it, then.
- It's all over.

01:22:36.827 --> 01:22:39.580
We could've stayed at home
making trees.

01:22:39.705 --> 01:22:43.917
- Oh, shut up.
- How could we have been so stupid?

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:47.087
I don't know.

01:23:03.061 --> 01:23:06.482
Hey! Look, look!
Quick! Come on! Look!

01:23:06.607 --> 01:23:08.734
Look at this.
Quickly!

01:23:08.859 --> 01:23:11.028
- Look!
- Good one of Wally.

01:23:11.153 --> 01:23:12.988
No! Look!

01:23:13.113 --> 01:23:14.948
It's the map!

01:23:15.073 --> 01:23:18.118
I can see it's the map.
What use is that to us now?

01:23:18.243 --> 01:23:21.121
Look, closer.
The time of legends, see?

01:23:22.247 --> 01:23:24.208
See the fortress
of ultimate darkness?

01:23:25.792 --> 01:23:27.878
- That's a hole?
- Exactly!

01:23:28.003 --> 01:23:30.339
- It could lead almost anywhere.
- Everywhere!

01:23:30.464 --> 01:23:31.590
What?

01:23:31.715 --> 01:23:34.301
We just found
the biggest hole in the universe,

01:23:34.426 --> 01:23:36.678
and it's practically below
our feet!

01:23:36.803 --> 01:23:38.972
Kevin, you're a genius!

01:23:39.097 --> 01:23:42.768
- Come on, you lot! Shift!
- We'll never get out of here!

01:23:42.851 --> 01:23:44.811
Wanna bet?

01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:49.942
No!

01:23:50.067 --> 01:23:53.487
That's right, og. Show 'em we can do
something right for a change.

01:23:58.242 --> 01:24:00.202
That's it.

01:24:11.713 --> 01:24:13.632
Let's have that.

01:24:49.001 --> 01:24:50.919
Give us some more.

01:24:52.713 --> 01:24:54.548
That's enough, Wally!

01:24:54.673 --> 01:24:56.550
Okay, strutter.

01:25:10.897 --> 01:25:12.816
- Have you got the rope?
- Hold on!

01:25:12.941 --> 01:25:14.985
Right.

01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:17.696
Hold tight!
Keep straight!

01:25:17.821 --> 01:25:20.824
- Watch your feet. Watch your feet.
- Easy.

01:25:31.043 --> 01:25:33.003
Hold it.

01:25:38.759 --> 01:25:42.137
Steady. Watch it.
Watch it.

01:25:42.262 --> 01:25:45.098
Hold your fingers.

01:25:50.145 --> 01:25:52.814
He's going!

01:26:01.573 --> 01:26:04.743
- It's coming.
- Go now.

01:26:04.868 --> 01:26:07.663
Ready? And...

01:26:36.108 --> 01:26:38.068
Again! Again!

01:26:44.324 --> 01:26:47.577
- Ready, Wally!
- Okay, strutter.

01:26:49.162 --> 01:26:52.999
Here we go!
Geronimo!

01:26:53.125 --> 01:26:56.169
Yeah!

01:26:58.964 --> 01:27:01.091
Okay! Go, strutter!

01:27:09.933 --> 01:27:12.018
- Strutter!
- Hey! We've made it!

01:27:12.144 --> 01:27:13.687
Okay, Wally.

01:27:21.027 --> 01:27:23.071
Take up the slack.

01:27:29.202 --> 01:27:31.705
Quick, Wally.

01:27:32.748 --> 01:27:35.125
" Go!

01:27:40.255 --> 01:27:42.966
Come on!

01:27:43.091 --> 01:27:45.177
Go, vermin!

01:27:45.302 --> 01:27:48.346
- Go, fidgit!
- I don't wanna go! I don't wanna go!

01:27:50.807 --> 01:27:54.728
- I'm going!
" Go!

01:27:57.189 --> 01:27:59.983
Come on!

01:28:00.108 --> 01:28:02.027
- Wally!
- Come on, Wally!

01:28:02.152 --> 01:28:05.155
Right, lads!
Watch this!

01:28:19.002 --> 01:28:22.005
- Wally!

01:28:27.844 --> 01:28:29.679
Pull the rope.

01:28:35.936 --> 01:28:37.896
There he is!

01:28:38.021 --> 01:28:39.940
- Wally!
- Wally!

01:28:42.192 --> 01:28:45.028
Pull him up!
That's it!

01:28:48.406 --> 01:28:50.575
- Well, we've done it.
- Yeah, we've done it.

01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:53.537
- Now all we need is the map.
- What?

01:28:53.662 --> 01:28:57.165
We don't need the map. We know where
the time hole is. Let's get out of here.

01:28:57.165 --> 01:29:00.669
- But evil's got the map, Randall!
- Oh, damn right, yes.

01:29:00.794 --> 01:29:02.963
Last thing we want to do
is see him again. Come on.

01:29:03.088 --> 01:29:06.174
But you can't leave it with him,
or he'll destroy the world!

01:29:09.553 --> 01:29:12.848
Oh, Robert, Benson,

01:29:12.973 --> 01:29:16.142
I feel the power of evil
coursing through my veins,

01:29:16.268 --> 01:29:20.564
filling every corner of my being
with the desire to do wrong.

01:29:20.689 --> 01:29:24.150
- I feel so bad, Benson.
- Good! Good!

01:29:24.276 --> 01:29:28.738
Yes, it is good, for this is the worst
kind of badness that I'm feeling.

01:29:28.864 --> 01:29:32.659
- Kill me, master! Kill me!
- Not now, Benson. We have work to do.

01:29:32.784 --> 01:29:36.204
No less a work than the overthrowing
of creation itself.

01:29:36.329 --> 01:29:40.750
We will remake man
in our image, not his.

01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:44.838
We will turn mountains
into sea,

01:29:44.963 --> 01:29:48.133
and the skies into rivers,
and fjords into deserts.

01:29:48.258 --> 01:29:51.177
- Come on! Come on!
- And deserts into quagmires.

01:29:51.303 --> 01:29:54.097
The boy's insane.
We can't go in there.

01:29:54.222 --> 01:29:56.141
Shh!

01:29:56.266 --> 01:29:58.143
Oh!

01:29:58.268 --> 01:30:00.687
- Let me see!
- And icebergs into fire!

01:30:00.812 --> 01:30:04.983
And the fire into a mighty rushing wind
which will cover the face of the earth...

01:30:04.983 --> 01:30:08.945
And wipe clean the scourge of woolly
thinking once and for all.

01:30:09.070 --> 01:30:12.032
We can make beans
into peas!

01:30:13.158 --> 01:30:15.285
Oh, Benson.

01:30:15.410 --> 01:30:19.998
Dear Benson, you are so mercifully free
of the ravages of intelligence.

01:30:20.123 --> 01:30:24.836
- You say... such nice things, master.
- Yes, I know. I'm sorry.

01:30:27.213 --> 01:30:32.010
Now, Benson, I shall have to turn you
into a dog for a while.

01:30:32.135 --> 01:30:34.095
Thank you, master.

01:30:38.391 --> 01:30:41.311
Stay, Benson.
Guard the map.

01:30:43.104 --> 01:30:46.149
Robert, we must plan
a new world together.

01:30:46.274 --> 01:30:48.151
This time
we'll start it properly.

01:30:48.276 --> 01:30:50.153
Tell me about computers.

01:30:50.278 --> 01:30:54.574
Uh, a computer
is an automatic electronic apparatus...

01:30:54.699 --> 01:30:57.160
For making calculations.

01:31:00.205 --> 01:31:03.041
Or controlling operations...

01:31:03.166 --> 01:31:05.168
That are expressible...

01:31:05.293 --> 01:31:08.088
In numerical
or logical terms.

01:31:09.214 --> 01:31:11.716
And fast breeder reactors?

01:31:11.841 --> 01:31:14.761
Ah, fast breeder reactors...

01:31:14.886 --> 01:31:18.640
Use a fast fission process...

01:31:18.765 --> 01:31:22.018
For the generation
of fissile isotopes.

01:31:28.066 --> 01:31:31.903
Be quiet, Benson!

01:31:32.028 --> 01:31:34.656
Show me more, Robert.

01:31:34.781 --> 01:31:36.992
Show me...

01:31:37.117 --> 01:31:41.705
Show me...
Subscriber trunk dialling.

01:31:41.830 --> 01:31:44.124
I must know everything.

01:32:09.274 --> 01:32:12.694
Come on! Throw!

01:32:12.819 --> 01:32:14.320
Throw it!

01:32:23.204 --> 01:32:25.290
Stop!

01:32:34.299 --> 01:32:36.217
Come on! Oh, no!

01:32:36.342 --> 01:32:39.304
Let's get out of here!

01:32:39.429 --> 01:32:41.347
Come on!

01:32:41.473 --> 01:32:44.976
Stop them by every means
in my power!

01:33:10.835 --> 01:33:13.838
It's coming this way!
Run for it!

01:33:13.963 --> 01:33:17.258
I'm coming!
I'm coming!

01:33:33.983 --> 01:33:35.902
We're trapped.

01:33:36.986 --> 01:33:39.280
- We've got to separate.
- What?

01:33:39.405 --> 01:33:42.742
Go down the time hole.
Go wherever you can and get help.

01:33:42.867 --> 01:33:45.703
- I'll divert them.
- But you can't do it on your own.

01:33:46.913 --> 01:33:50.125
No. I'll take one other.

01:33:51.209 --> 01:33:53.169
Well done, og.

01:33:53.294 --> 01:33:55.964
Yes. Og and me'll stay.
Ready?

01:33:58.967 --> 01:34:01.136
Hey! Hey! This way!

01:34:41.551 --> 01:34:45.096
You are a very troublesome
little fellow.

01:34:49.100 --> 01:34:52.729
I think I should teach you
one of my special lessons.

01:34:52.854 --> 01:34:54.731
What do you think, Robert?

01:34:54.856 --> 01:34:57.358
Benson, what would look nice?

01:34:58.610 --> 01:35:00.570
Half donkey?

01:35:00.695 --> 01:35:03.072
Half warthog?
Half oyster?

01:35:04.616 --> 01:35:06.034
Half carrot?

01:35:08.119 --> 01:35:11.080
Or the diseased left tonsil...

01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:18.087
Call off those, those creatures,
or I'll destroy the map forever.

01:35:18.213 --> 01:35:21.216
- Don't, don't be so stupid.
- Call them off!

01:35:24.093 --> 01:35:26.888
Very well.
I have no need of them.

01:35:29.224 --> 01:35:31.935
- Robert.
- Yes, master?

01:35:32.060 --> 01:35:34.062
Your time has come.

01:35:34.187 --> 01:35:38.191
Oh, wonderful, master! Wonderful!

01:35:38.316 --> 01:35:41.194
- Wonderful!
- Don't mention it.

01:35:51.204 --> 01:35:52.372
Benson.

01:35:59.045 --> 01:36:01.005
I'm a reasonable man.

01:36:02.632 --> 01:36:04.592
Give me the map,

01:36:04.717 --> 01:36:07.178
and you might at least walk out
of here on human feet.

01:36:07.303 --> 01:36:09.389
- 0g!

01:36:11.099 --> 01:36:13.059
No!

01:36:21.025 --> 01:36:22.777
" No!

01:36:33.329 --> 01:36:35.081
No!

01:37:09.907 --> 01:37:12.285
This way, men.
Over there.

01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:28.134
Wally!

01:37:36.601 --> 01:37:38.853
- Where's the trouble, Sonny?
- Down there!

01:37:38.978 --> 01:37:40.688
A-ha!

01:37:40.813 --> 01:37:43.775
So... this is the best...

01:37:43.900 --> 01:37:47.362
The supreme being can do.

01:37:47.487 --> 01:37:50.198
I guess we'll have
a lynchin', eh? Yippee!

01:37:52.241 --> 01:37:54.911
Wait!

01:38:04.545 --> 01:38:06.089
Got him!

01:38:07.173 --> 01:38:10.885
See, Sonny? No problem.

01:38:15.264 --> 01:38:17.683
Wait a minute!
Wait!

01:38:17.809 --> 01:38:20.019
Wait a minute!
Oh! Oh! Hey!

01:38:20.144 --> 01:38:23.022
Hold on! Hey! Hey!

01:38:23.147 --> 01:38:25.525
- Let me go!
- I don't feel so good!

01:38:25.650 --> 01:38:28.653
I

01:39:06.107 --> 01:39:07.733
fire!

01:39:23.374 --> 01:39:25.168
Look out!

01:39:42.977 --> 01:39:45.021
Charge!

01:40:19.722 --> 01:40:21.807
Strutter! Quick!

01:40:21.933 --> 01:40:23.851
Strutter!

01:40:28.981 --> 01:40:30.107
Next!

01:40:32.860 --> 01:40:35.071
Get him!

01:40:39.951 --> 01:40:41.869
Randall, go!

01:40:43.162 --> 01:40:45.122
Go!

01:41:11.857 --> 01:41:14.902
- I can't control it!
- Of course you can't, you silly man.

01:41:15.027 --> 01:41:17.655
I control them!

01:41:28.291 --> 01:41:30.084
Hurry! Help me!

01:41:46.392 --> 01:41:48.936
Get me down!

01:41:49.061 --> 01:41:51.689
Stay where you are!
Something's happening!

01:42:03.951 --> 01:42:06.787
Get out of the way, fidgit!

01:42:07.788 --> 01:42:11.042
Get out of the way!

01:42:25.139 --> 01:42:27.767
- Fidgit!
<i>'</i> Hey' hey, fidgit!

01:42:30.102 --> 01:42:32.146
Fidgit!

01:42:32.271 --> 01:42:35.691
Quick! Push it off him!
Push it off. Quick.

01:42:38.027 --> 01:42:40.529
- He's dead.
- What?

01:42:40.655 --> 01:42:42.531
Fidgit's dead.

01:42:42.657 --> 01:42:45.701
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

01:42:45.826 --> 01:42:49.080
- It wasn't your fault, Wally.
- It was, it was his fault.

01:42:49.205 --> 01:42:51.457
- Get down, Wally!
- Get down!

01:42:51.582 --> 01:42:53.751
- Wally! Get down, Wally!
- Evil!

01:42:53.876 --> 01:42:56.962
Come on back!

01:42:57.088 --> 01:43:00.216
Evil!
He killed my friend!

01:43:01.300 --> 01:43:04.011
I'll kill him!
Get off me!

01:43:04.136 --> 01:43:06.055
Get down!

01:43:10.309 --> 01:43:12.895
I'll kill him!

01:43:52.852 --> 01:43:55.604
Huh?

01:43:55.730 --> 01:43:58.023
- Oh, no!
- He's found us!

01:43:58.149 --> 01:44:00.151
Quick! Run for it!

01:44:12.663 --> 01:44:16.542
Oh! I hate
having to appear like that.

01:44:16.667 --> 01:44:18.794
Really,
it's the most tiresomely...

01:44:18.919 --> 01:44:20.755
Noisy manifestation.

01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:23.674
Still, rather expected
of one, I suppose.

01:44:23.799 --> 01:44:25.801
Get down! Get down!

01:44:25.926 --> 01:44:29.138
O great one!
O supreme being!

01:44:29.263 --> 01:44:31.140
O creator of all the universe,

01:44:31.265 --> 01:44:34.435
without whom we would be naught
but scarab beetles on the...

01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:37.897
What a dreadful mess!
Ls the pig with you?

01:44:40.816 --> 01:44:43.569
Right.
Well, we'll sort him out first.

01:44:46.906 --> 01:44:48.866
<i>'</i> - 0g!

01:44:48.991 --> 01:44:53.454
- Og, here! Quick! Out of the way!
- I was enjoying that.

01:44:53.579 --> 01:44:56.665
One thing I can't stand,
it's mess.

01:44:56.791 --> 01:44:59.084
I want all this stuff
picked up.

01:44:59.210 --> 01:45:02.463
Yes, sir.
Anything you say.

01:45:03.798 --> 01:45:06.926
- Anything you say, sir.
- Wally, tidy up!

01:45:09.678 --> 01:45:12.014
But, but he's dead, Randall.

01:45:12.139 --> 01:45:14.016
Fidgit, fidgit's dead.

01:45:14.141 --> 01:45:17.812
Dead?
No excuse for laying off work.

01:45:23.567 --> 01:45:25.152
- Fidgit.
- Fidgit.

01:45:25.277 --> 01:45:28.906
- Fidgit?

01:45:29.031 --> 01:45:32.535
- What happened?
- I'm sorry I killed you, fidgit.

01:45:32.660 --> 01:45:34.829
He's okay!
He's okay!

01:45:34.954 --> 01:45:37.623
Oh, do hurry up.

01:45:37.748 --> 01:45:39.792
- Oh, yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

01:45:39.917 --> 01:45:42.044
I'd like to explain everything.

01:45:42.169 --> 01:45:45.130
We didn't mean to steal the map.
We didn't mean to run away...

01:45:45.256 --> 01:45:48.467
What do you mean, you didn't
mean to steal the map?

01:45:48.592 --> 01:45:51.887
- It, it just sort of...
- Of course you didn't mean to steal it.

01:45:52.012 --> 01:45:56.851
I gave it to you.
You silly man. And that.

01:45:59.603 --> 01:46:02.481
- Do you really think I didn't know?
- Sir?

01:46:02.606 --> 01:46:06.068
I had to have some way
of testing my handiwork.

01:46:06.193 --> 01:46:09.446
I think it turned out
rather well.

01:46:09.572 --> 01:46:12.366
" Don't you?
" Hmm?

01:46:13.701 --> 01:46:17.204
Evil turned out rather well.
Mm-hmm.

01:46:20.207 --> 01:46:23.085
Whose are these?

01:46:23.961 --> 01:46:25.880
Mine, sir.

01:46:26.005 --> 01:46:28.549
They're mine, sir.

01:46:28.674 --> 01:46:31.218
You really are an untidy boy.

01:46:31.343 --> 01:46:34.221
Sign... here.

01:46:37.933 --> 01:46:40.227
Do you mean you knew
what was happening to us all the time?

01:46:40.352 --> 01:46:43.147
Well, of course.
I am the supreme being.

01:46:43.272 --> 01:46:45.691
- I'm not entirely dim.
- Oh, no, sir.

01:46:45.816 --> 01:46:47.735
We're not suggesting that, sir.
It's just...

01:46:47.860 --> 01:46:51.614
That I let you borrow
my map.

01:46:53.699 --> 01:46:57.494
Now I want every bit of evil...

01:46:57.620 --> 01:46:59.663
Placed in here.

01:46:59.788 --> 01:47:01.832
- Right away.
- Of course, sir.

01:47:02.917 --> 01:47:04.793
Come on.

01:47:04.919 --> 01:47:09.089
You mean you let all those people die,
just to test your creation?

01:47:09.214 --> 01:47:13.135
Yes.
You really are a clever boy.

01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:16.597
Why did they have to die?

01:47:16.722 --> 01:47:18.974
You might as well say,
"why do we have to have evil?"

01:47:19.099 --> 01:47:21.810
Oh, we wouldn't dream of asking
a question like that, sir.

01:47:21.936 --> 01:47:24.688
Yes. Why do we have
to have evil?

01:47:24.813 --> 01:47:26.690
Ah.

01:47:29.026 --> 01:47:31.445
I think it's something to do with freewill.

01:47:32.988 --> 01:47:35.032
Do be careful.

01:47:35.157 --> 01:47:36.992
You weren't watching.

01:47:37.117 --> 01:47:40.663
Don't lose any of that stuff.
That's concentrated evil.

01:47:40.788 --> 01:47:43.999
One drop of that could turn
you all into hermit crabs.

01:47:44.124 --> 01:47:46.961
I'm sorry, sir.

01:47:47.086 --> 01:47:49.880
I, I was just wondering
if there's, um,

01:47:50.005 --> 01:47:53.884
any chance we might
have our old jobs back, sir.

01:47:54.009 --> 01:47:57.972
Oh, you certainly were
appallingly bad robbers.

01:47:58.097 --> 01:47:59.348
Yes, sir.

01:47:59.473 --> 01:48:03.102
I really should do something
very extrovert and vengeful with you.

01:48:03.102 --> 01:48:05.020
Honestly, I'm too tired.

01:48:05.145 --> 01:48:08.983
But I think I'll just transfer you
to the undergrowth department...

01:48:09.108 --> 01:48:11.944
Yes, bracken, small shrubs...
That sort of thing...

01:48:12.069 --> 01:48:17.116
With a 19% cut in salary
backdated to the beginning of time.

01:48:17.241 --> 01:48:19.243
- Thank you, sir.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

01:48:19.368 --> 01:48:23.038
Well, I am the nice one.

01:48:23.163 --> 01:48:25.791
Is it all ready? Right!

01:48:25.916 --> 01:48:29.169
Come on, then.
Back to creation.

01:48:29.294 --> 01:48:32.464
- I mustn't waste any more time.
- Bye, Kevin.

01:48:32.589 --> 01:48:37.052
They'll think I've lost control
again and put it all down to evolution.

01:48:37.177 --> 01:48:39.054
- Come on.
- Sir?

01:48:39.179 --> 01:48:42.224
- Yes? - What about my friend, sir?
Can he come with us?

01:48:42.307 --> 01:48:45.978
No, of course not.
This isn't a school outing.

01:48:46.103 --> 01:48:47.896
But, sir,
he deserves something.

01:48:48.022 --> 01:48:51.608
- I mean, without him...
- Oh, don't go on about it.

01:48:51.734 --> 01:48:54.820
- He's got to stay here to carry on the fight.
- Fidgit!

01:48:54.862 --> 01:48:57.156
Come on. Fidgit!

01:48:57.281 --> 01:49:00.617
Hey! You can't go!

01:49:00.743 --> 01:49:03.746
- Hey, you can't leave me!
- Fidgit!

01:49:03.871 --> 01:49:05.539
- Fidgit, come on!
- Wait, please!

01:49:05.664 --> 01:49:09.043
- Come on, fidgit!
- Hey! Stop!

01:49:09.168 --> 01:49:12.713
Hey!
Hey! Don't leave me!

01:49:12.838 --> 01:49:16.008
Hey! Help! Stop!

01:49:16.133 --> 01:49:19.803
Don't go! Help! Don't leave me!

01:49:19.928 --> 01:49:23.098
Hey! Don't go! Stop!

01:49:23.223 --> 01:49:26.852
Don't leave me! Please! Wait!

01:49:26.977 --> 01:49:28.979
Don't leave me! Please!

01:49:40.115 --> 01:49:42.034
Come on! Come on!

01:49:44.161 --> 01:49:46.163
Let's go!

01:49:53.712 --> 01:49:57.132
- Let go! I've got to save it!
- Don't be a fool, Diane!

01:49:57.257 --> 01:50:00.052
- I'm going in for the toaster!
- No! No!

01:50:00.177 --> 01:50:03.222
- Oh, Trevor!
- Me super deluxe steamer!

01:50:03.347 --> 01:50:05.474
Oh!

01:50:05.599 --> 01:50:07.643
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:50:07.768 --> 01:50:09.978
I think so.

01:50:10.104 --> 01:50:13.148
You're a very lucky boy.

01:50:13.273 --> 01:50:16.652
Honestly, Trevor.
If you'd been half a man,

01:50:16.777 --> 01:50:19.071
you'd have gone in there
after the blender.

01:50:31.375 --> 01:50:33.252
- This is what started it.
- Eh?

01:50:33.377 --> 01:50:35.295
Left the Sunday joint
cookin' all night, didn't we?

01:50:35.420 --> 01:50:39.633
Sunday joint?
It's Thursday.

01:50:39.758 --> 01:50:41.426
I never touched it!

01:50:41.552 --> 01:50:44.721
Well, someone put it on.

01:50:44.847 --> 01:50:46.723
Well, there was no meat
in there last night.

01:50:46.849 --> 01:50:49.184
Oh! Well, what do you
call this then?

01:50:54.148 --> 01:50:56.024
Mum! Dad!

01:50:56.150 --> 01:50:58.026
It's evil!

01:50:58.152 --> 01:51:00.863
Don't touch it!

01:51:29.725 --> 01:51:31.685
Mum?

01:51:34.229 --> 01:51:36.190
Dad?

01:52:18.023 --> 01:52:22.986
I

01:52:33.830 --> 01:52:35.707
I midnight sunshine

01:52:35.832 --> 01:52:40.212
I silence under sky
is black as day

01:52:43.298 --> 01:52:46.218
I only a dream away

01:52:48.303 --> 01:52:51.181
I

01:53:04.069 --> 01:53:07.698
I waking while you're still
deep sleeping

01:53:07.823 --> 01:53:11.201
I finding you're not here

01:53:13.829 --> 01:53:16.331
I watchin' a dream appear

01:53:22.212 --> 01:53:24.131
I tumbling through

01:53:24.256 --> 01:53:27.968
I a thousand centuries

01:53:28.093 --> 01:53:30.679
I you don't know
where you'll land

01:53:30.804 --> 01:53:33.974
I it's so dark in mythology

01:53:36.435 --> 01:53:39.229
I treasures of history

01:53:39.354 --> 01:53:41.231
I to be found

01:53:41.356 --> 01:53:45.277
I within the legends of time

01:53:45.402 --> 01:53:48.905
I all the handiworks we made

01:53:49.031 --> 01:53:52.784
I were only a dream away

01:53:55.078 --> 01:53:58.040
I

01:54:10.635 --> 01:54:12.596
I greedy feeling

01:54:12.721 --> 01:54:14.473
I wheeling, dealing

01:54:14.598 --> 01:54:16.975
I losin' what you won

01:54:20.145 --> 01:54:23.231
I see the dream come undone

01:54:28.820 --> 01:54:33.116
I stumble you may
with your mentoring

01:54:34.242 --> 01:54:37.037
I lucky you got so far

01:54:37.162 --> 01:54:40.290
I all you owe is apologies

01:54:42.876 --> 01:54:45.212
I measure the mystery

01:54:45.337 --> 01:54:47.714
I and the sound

01:54:47.839 --> 01:54:51.176
I it's like taking up time

01:54:51.301 --> 01:54:55.806
I it shows the handiworks
we've made

01:54:55.931 --> 01:54:59.017
I only a dream away
