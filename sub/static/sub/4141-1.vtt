00:27.204 --> 00:29.332
You don't make up for your sins in church.

00:30.207 --> 00:33.044
You do it in the streets. You do it at home.

00:34.712 --> 00:36.672
The rest is bullshit and you know it.

03:47.071 --> 03:49.073
What the hell is this?

03:50.575 --> 03:52.952
Not in my fuckin' place!

04:02.086 --> 04:04.714
Keep out of my place! I know your face!

04:05.339 --> 04:07.758
And you, scumbag!

04:08.801 --> 04:11.178
I told ya about passin'
that shit in my place.

04:11.262 --> 04:12.597
I didn't do nothin'!

04:14.599 --> 04:16.350
You're supposed to be the bouncer.

04:16.434 --> 04:19.228
-I didn't do nothin'.
-That's it. Ya didn't do nothin'.

04:39.957 --> 04:42.293
Come on, hurry up with that shit, huh?

05:06.484 --> 05:07.944
What's this, more shit?

05:08.152 --> 05:10.988
No, that ain't shit. That's a German lens.

05:11.072 --> 05:13.449
I've got two shipments of those.
That's good stuff.

05:13.532 --> 05:14.951
Can't use it.

05:15.034 --> 05:16.953
What do ya mean ya can't use it?

05:17.119 --> 05:19.830
That's a telescopic one.
That's the best one they make.

05:20.164 --> 05:24.001
It's not German, it's Jap.
This is an adaptor, it's not a lens.

05:24.252 --> 05:27.171
You bought two shipments
of Jap adaptors, not lenses.

05:31.175 --> 05:32.635
Jap adaptors.

06:17.680 --> 06:20.683
Lord, I'm not worthy to eat your flesh.

06:21.892 --> 06:23.519
Not worthy to drink your blood.

06:23.561 --> 06:25.730
Not worthy to drink your blood.

06:28.190 --> 06:30.192
Okay, I just come out of confession, right?

06:30.276 --> 06:31.402
Right.

06:32.904 --> 06:34.739
And the priest gives me the usual penance:

06:34.780 --> 06:38.075
Ten ''Hail Marys'', ten ''Our Fathers'',
ten whatever.

06:39.785 --> 06:42.955
Next week, I'll come back and he'll give me
another ten ''Hail Marys'' and...

06:43.039 --> 06:44.999
... another ten ''Our Fathers'' and....

06:45.499 --> 06:47.710
I mean, you know how I feel
about that shit.

06:48.002 --> 06:51.547
Those things, they don't mean anything
to me. They're just words.

06:53.257 --> 06:56.594
Now, that may be okay for the others,
but it just doesn't work for me.

06:56.886 --> 07:00.264
I mean, if I do somethin' wrong,
I just want to pay for it my way.

07:00.640 --> 07:03.434
So, I do my own penance for my own sins.

07:03.935 --> 07:05.269
What do ya say, huh?

07:05.686 --> 07:09.231
It's all bullshit except the pain, right?
The pain of hell.

07:10.274 --> 07:13.319
The burn from a lighted match
increased a million times.

07:13.611 --> 07:14.820
In finite.

07:15.279 --> 07:18.616
Ya don't fuck around with the in finite.
There's no way you do that.

07:20.117 --> 07:22.036
The pain in hell has two sides:

07:22.203 --> 07:24.622
The kind you can touch with your hand.

07:25.039 --> 07:27.124
The kind you can feel in your heart.

07:27.625 --> 07:29.961
Your soul, the spiritual side.

07:31.212 --> 07:32.672
And ya know...

07:33.130 --> 07:34.966
...the worst of the two...

07:35.091 --> 07:36.550
...is the spiritual.

08:56.380 --> 08:58.007
Hey, Charlie, you're crazy.

08:58.257 --> 08:59.717
The priest taught me this.

08:59.884 --> 09:01.552
Terrific. You know any other tricks?

09:01.636 --> 09:04.055
Yeah, but I'll show 'em to ya
when I learn this one.

09:16.817 --> 09:19.737
You know somethin'?
She is really good-lookin'.

09:20.738 --> 09:23.366
I gotta say that again.
She is really good-lookin'!

09:25.117 --> 09:26.244
But she's black.

09:27.411 --> 09:29.247
You can see that real plain, right?

09:30.581 --> 09:33.376
Look, there's not much
of a difference anyway, is there?

09:33.417 --> 09:35.253
Well, is there?

09:44.553 --> 09:45.763
Oh, great.

09:46.931 --> 09:48.140
Hey, Marlboro.

09:48.266 --> 09:50.851
For these prices, Charlie,
you shouldn't complain.

09:51.811 --> 09:54.939
But it's the best I could do.
Maybe next week I can do better.

09:55.940 --> 09:58.901
If ya can't smoke 'em,
maybe ya can sell 'em.

09:59.944 --> 10:01.404
No, I'll be okay for a week.

10:01.988 --> 10:03.155
Bless you.

10:03.614 --> 10:05.116
Seen Johnny Boy?

10:05.825 --> 10:06.951
No.

10:07.159 --> 10:08.953
He's supposed to be here.

10:09.203 --> 10:11.831
But who knows what goes on
in that kid's head, right?

10:11.914 --> 10:14.959
I'd like to know, Charlie.
I think the kid's trying to duck me.

10:16.586 --> 10:19.463
Don't you think you oughta care more
about Johnny's payments to me?

10:19.547 --> 10:21.340
I think you should. You know that.

10:21.424 --> 10:23.968
Michael...nobody's out to screw you.

10:24.927 --> 10:26.387
I guarantee that.

10:27.054 --> 10:30.391
Well, you're not lookin' at it from my side.
You vouched for the kid.

10:30.641 --> 10:33.477
What happens if he doesn't pay?
I gotta collect from you?

10:33.978 --> 10:36.022
-I don't want to do that.
-You're right.

10:37.148 --> 10:39.025
I made a deal with him, not you, right?

10:39.108 --> 10:41.444
You're right. I'm not gonna pay his debts,
believe me.

10:41.485 --> 10:43.237
I'll talk to him. I'll straighten him out.

10:43.321 --> 10:45.740
Straighten him out?
The bum owes money left and right.

10:45.823 --> 10:47.658
Don't worry, Michael--

10:47.950 --> 10:49.911
Hey! Hey, come on!

10:51.996 --> 10:53.122
Get out of here!

10:54.624 --> 10:56.375
-Come on, sit down.
-Take it easy.

10:56.584 --> 10:59.921
-Hey, what's the matter with you?
-Everybody's friends here, right?

11:00.588 --> 11:02.006
Come on, sit down.

11:02.089 --> 11:04.216
Dammit, Charlie, I don't understand you.

11:05.092 --> 11:07.845
I don't understand why you hang around
with a punk kid.

11:08.012 --> 11:09.931
I mean, he's the biggest jerk off around.

11:10.014 --> 11:12.141
Don't say that. Don't quarrel man, will ya?

11:12.224 --> 11:13.517
What's the matter?

11:14.560 --> 11:17.438
Family things, a few things.
I can't explain it, all right?

11:17.521 --> 11:18.981
He really is a good kid.

11:19.565 --> 11:22.568
All right, sure. I'll see you.

11:22.693 --> 11:24.362
Right, later. Be well.

11:34.080 --> 11:36.832
Come on, girls. Give her your coats.
Give her your coats.

11:40.044 --> 11:43.005
If you don't mind, young lady,
I would like to check these.

11:45.216 --> 11:48.552
But I'm keeping my skin pants.

11:50.638 --> 11:52.181
Hey, here he is!

11:57.061 --> 11:59.188
Are those the shorts
with the hearts on 'em?

12:01.107 --> 12:02.733
Girls, after you.

12:02.900 --> 12:06.362
All right, okay. Thanks a lot, Lord.
Thanks a lot for opening my eyes.

12:07.071 --> 12:09.907
You talk about penance
and you send this through the door.

12:10.741 --> 12:12.910
Well, we play by your rules, don't we?

12:12.994 --> 12:14.245
Well, don't we?

13:11.636 --> 13:13.512
-How are ya?
-All right. How are you?

13:13.596 --> 13:16.390
I want you to meet
two beautiful young ladies here.

13:16.474 --> 13:18.100
This is my good friend, Charlie.

13:18.184 --> 13:20.478
This is my good friend, Tony,
who owns the joint.

13:20.519 --> 13:22.104
This is, what's your name, darling?

13:22.146 --> 13:24.273
-Sarah.
-Sarah, Sarah Kline, right?

13:24.523 --> 13:27.151
Sarah Kline, this is Tony.

13:27.235 --> 13:28.945
This is...what's your name?

13:29.111 --> 13:31.447
Heather, Heather Weintraub, right?

13:35.826 --> 13:37.370
I met them in the Village.

13:37.495 --> 13:38.412
Bohemian.

13:38.496 --> 13:40.206
Yeah, over at the Cafe Bizarre.

13:42.500 --> 13:44.752
-What do ya want to drink, huh?
-Tequila.

13:45.378 --> 13:47.338
-You got tequila?
-No.

13:48.381 --> 13:50.007
Never mind. Listen....

13:50.508 --> 13:53.177
I'll order somethin'
that's good for the both of ya.

13:53.344 --> 13:56.973
Go on, give yourself a drink.
Give me and Charlie a J& B, will ya, please?

13:57.014 --> 13:58.432
-What's this?
-What's what?

13:58.516 --> 14:00.184
-This.
-What?

14:00.559 --> 14:03.396
-That. What does this look like? Huh?
-What?

14:03.521 --> 14:04.855
Where did you get this?

14:05.398 --> 14:07.149
-What?
-Where did you get this?

14:07.275 --> 14:09.026
-This.
-What?

14:09.360 --> 14:12.196
-This?
-Yeah. In the back, come on.

14:17.368 --> 14:19.328
You're makin' me look bad, Charlie.

14:19.912 --> 14:21.038
In front of the girls here.

14:21.122 --> 14:23.916
Oh, excuse me.
I didn't mean to be rude, girls.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.004
Mr. Civello, I'd like your presence
in the back room, if you got a moment.

14:28.421 --> 14:32.216
Well, you mean you request my presence
for a moment or two in the back room?

14:32.383 --> 14:33.551
I most certainly do.

14:33.634 --> 14:35.177
Well, after you.

14:35.261 --> 14:37.054
-Nah, after you.
-No, after you.

14:37.430 --> 14:40.016
-Mr. Civello, after you.
-No, after you.

14:40.141 --> 14:41.392
In the back!

14:42.727 --> 14:45.062
Tony, give them whatever they want.

14:46.022 --> 14:48.316
Hey, girls, excuse me.

14:48.399 --> 14:50.860
Tony, keep an eye on these nice girls here.

14:50.985 --> 14:53.404
Don't let none of the vultures look, okay?

14:53.571 --> 14:54.697
What are ya doin'?

14:54.906 --> 14:57.033
What do ya mean?
What are ya doin' to me, huh?

14:57.074 --> 14:57.909
What do ya mean?

14:57.992 --> 15:00.536
Michael's been on my back all night.
He's botherin' me.

15:00.578 --> 15:02.914
Why didn't ya make your payment
last Tuesday?

15:03.080 --> 15:05.708
I made my payment last Tuesday.
What are you talkin' about?

15:05.791 --> 15:07.960
-You paid him last week?
-Yeah, I paid him last week.

15:08.044 --> 15:11.505
What did he say, I didn't pay him?
He's a fuckin' liar. Where is he?

15:11.589 --> 15:13.299
-You paid him?
-Yeah, I paid him.

15:13.633 --> 15:15.384
-Last week?
-Yeah!

15:15.760 --> 15:17.303
-Last Tuesday?
-Yeah.

15:18.596 --> 15:20.222
-Charlie, you don't know....
-He's here.

15:20.306 --> 15:21.974
-Where?
-Out front.

15:22.058 --> 15:23.309
-He's here?
-Yeah.

15:23.434 --> 15:24.560
So, what do I care?

15:24.894 --> 15:27.939
Let me go get him.
We'll straighten this thing out, all right?

15:28.606 --> 15:30.149
Hey, wait a minute, Charlie.

15:30.232 --> 15:32.109
-What?
-Well, you're right.

15:32.360 --> 15:33.277
I'm right?

15:33.402 --> 15:35.404
Yeah, was it last Tuesday?

15:35.780 --> 15:39.325
It's the Tuesday that was last week,
that's before the one about to come up.

15:39.408 --> 15:43.204
My mistake, I'm sorry. It was last week,
the week before, that I was thinking of.

15:43.287 --> 15:45.164
-Oh, yeah. It was, huh?
-That's right.

15:45.831 --> 15:48.793
What's the matter with you?
You can't bullshit people that way.

15:48.876 --> 15:50.795
You give your word, you gotta keep it.

15:50.878 --> 15:53.631
You know what happened?
I'm so depressed about other things.

15:53.714 --> 15:55.925
I can't worry about payments,
you know what I mean?

15:55.967 --> 15:58.803
I come home last Tuesday.
I have my money in cash.

15:59.762 --> 16:01.806
Comin' home, I ran into Jimmy Sparks.

16:01.889 --> 16:04.725
I owe him $700, like for four months.
I gotta pay the guy.

16:04.809 --> 16:07.520
He lives in my buildin', hangs out
across the street. I gotta pay him.

16:07.603 --> 16:08.896
So what happened?

16:08.980 --> 16:10.690
I had to give some to my mother.

16:10.773 --> 16:12.817
I wound up with $25
at the end of the week.

16:12.900 --> 16:15.361
And today, you ain't gonna believe,
'cause it's incredible.

16:15.444 --> 16:17.321
-I can't believe it myself.
-What?

16:17.405 --> 16:20.157
I was in a game.
I was ahead like $600 or $700, right?

16:20.199 --> 16:21.534
-You're kiddin'?
-That's the streak.

16:21.617 --> 16:22.994
You know Joey Clams?

16:23.119 --> 16:24.287
Joey Scala, yeah.

16:24.537 --> 16:27.164
-I know him, too, yeah.
-No, Joey Scala is Joey Clams.

16:27.290 --> 16:28.499
-Right.
-Right.

16:28.791 --> 16:30.585
-They're the same person.
-Yeah.

16:32.253 --> 16:35.506
So I was in there playin'
bankers and brokers. All of a sudden...

16:35.840 --> 16:38.259
...I'm ahead like $600, $700.
I'm really winnin'.

16:38.342 --> 16:42.305
All of a sudden some kid walks in
and yells that the bulls are comin', right?

16:42.430 --> 16:45.600
The cops are comin'. Everybody runs
away. I grab all the money. I go in.

16:45.683 --> 16:47.351
It's an excuse, like to get away.

16:47.435 --> 16:50.646
I'd give everybody the money later,
and that way I'd get out.

16:50.730 --> 16:53.316
I don't have to get into the game
and get a losin' streak.

16:53.357 --> 16:55.943
When I come out into the yard,
I don't know this buildin'.

16:56.027 --> 16:58.571
I don't know nothin'.
I couldn't get out. It was like a box.

16:58.654 --> 17:00.698
Big, like this. So I gotta go back in.

17:00.865 --> 17:04.577
Not only do I go back in,
but this kid says it's a false alarm.

17:04.952 --> 17:07.204
Imagine that?
I wanted to kill this fuckin' kid.

17:09.373 --> 17:11.584
I was so crazy, I wanted to kill this kid.

17:11.709 --> 17:15.338
Meanwhile, I gotta get back in the game.
Bing, bing, bing! I lose $400.

17:16.547 --> 17:18.715
Meanwhile, Frankie Bones is over there.

17:18.799 --> 17:21.135
I owe him $1,300 for seven,
eight months already.

17:21.218 --> 17:24.137
He's after me. I can't walk on the street
without duckin' that guy.

17:24.221 --> 17:26.973
He's like waitin' for me.
Like I can't move, you know.

17:27.058 --> 17:29.852
He sees that I'm losin', right?
So he's waitin' for me.

17:29.894 --> 17:31.729
He's tappin' me on the shoulder.
He's saying, ''Hey.''

17:31.771 --> 17:34.023
Tappin' me like this. Like a hawk.

17:34.106 --> 17:36.192
''Hey, get it up. You're losin'.
Give me some money.''

17:36.234 --> 17:40.112
I say, ''Frankie, come on. Give me a break
over here. Let me win some back.

17:40.238 --> 17:42.323
''I got debts. I'm in a big hole.''

17:42.406 --> 17:45.326
He says, ''Never mind, give me the money.''
I say, ''Okay, Frankie.''

17:45.409 --> 17:47.703
So I give him $200.
Meanwhile, I lost the deal.

17:47.912 --> 17:49.372
I go outside, a little depressed--

17:49.413 --> 17:52.208
I'll cut the story short
'cause you don't want to hear all this.

17:52.250 --> 17:53.584
I know, I know, I know.

17:53.626 --> 17:54.877
Make a long story short.

17:54.919 --> 17:57.129
So anyway, I went out shoppin'.

17:57.213 --> 18:00.383
Got a new tie, got this shirt, right?
You like the shirt?

18:00.466 --> 18:01.926
It's nice. This tie--

18:02.093 --> 18:05.846
Michael doesn't care if you're depressed!
What is he, your priest?

18:05.930 --> 18:09.100
Why are ya goin' shoppin'
when ya owe money? It ain't right.

18:09.350 --> 18:10.601
How much ya got there?

18:10.685 --> 18:12.728
I'm gonna pay him next week.
I'm gonna pay him!

18:12.812 --> 18:14.605
You're gonna and ya don't do nothin'.

18:14.689 --> 18:16.023
How much you got there?

18:16.107 --> 18:18.442
I got about, I don't know, I got about $40.

18:19.151 --> 18:20.528
What are ya doin'?

18:22.947 --> 18:24.907
I got about $40 there. That's all.

18:30.288 --> 18:31.414
What are ya doin'?

18:31.497 --> 18:34.750
I'm holdin' on to this till next week,
till ya make the next payment.

18:34.792 --> 18:37.086
Why, there's a little more than $40?

18:37.128 --> 18:38.754
-It's a mistake.
-Mistake, huh?

18:38.838 --> 18:42.633
Hey, listen, I swear to my mother,
you come with me next Tuesday...

18:42.967 --> 18:46.887
...I sign the paycheck over to you. I swear
to my mother, swear to Christ, okay?

18:46.971 --> 18:49.056
Come on, it's $110. You give it to Michael.

18:49.140 --> 18:52.184
Come on, give me some money.
We got those beautiful girls out there.

18:52.268 --> 18:53.644
We're gonna get laid now.

18:53.686 --> 18:56.188
I met those chicks in that Cafe Bizarre.

18:56.564 --> 18:59.191
They were fuckin' around
with these two other guys.

18:59.317 --> 19:02.945
That one, Weintraub, is very nice.
Very nice. I want to bang her like crazy.

19:03.029 --> 19:03.946
Here.

19:05.323 --> 19:08.326
-That's enough for you.
-Give me another five. Come on.

19:08.409 --> 19:09.827
Which one do you want?

19:12.038 --> 19:14.332
You're leavin' me with nothin'.
We gotta go eat chinks?

19:14.373 --> 19:16.709
That's it and you better make do with this
for the week.

19:16.792 --> 19:18.544
Which one do you want?

19:19.045 --> 19:21.422
I want the Weintraub one. She's nice.
I like that one.

19:21.505 --> 19:22.965
She's the one on the left?

19:23.507 --> 19:25.843
Nah, she's the one-- Your left or my left?

19:26.552 --> 19:29.597
-We're both standin' the same way.
-Well, it don't matter.

19:29.680 --> 19:33.434
Hey, girls, we had a little business
to talk over. Everything's okay now.

19:33.517 --> 19:34.936
It's beautiful.

19:35.353 --> 19:38.064
Hey, Tony, you think maybe
you could put this on the tab...

19:38.147 --> 19:42.109
...because somethin' happened before?
You'll be doin' me a favor, you know?

19:43.778 --> 19:45.196
Big tab or the little tab?

19:45.738 --> 19:49.158
Don't you think it's better
that you should put it on the small tab...

19:49.200 --> 19:51.702
...so that it balances out with the big tab?

19:52.745 --> 19:54.914
-Oh, so things even out?
-Yeah, right.

19:55.456 --> 19:57.708
Joey, where'd you get those beads?

19:58.542 --> 20:00.503
How about me, too? I don't get a drink?

20:00.544 --> 20:03.047
-Hey, Mikey!
-Long time no see.

20:03.214 --> 20:04.799
You don't get a drink!

20:04.882 --> 20:07.218
Does a bear shit in the woods over here?

20:12.556 --> 20:14.558
Come on, give him a double, Tony.
Give him a double.

20:14.725 --> 20:15.643
Long time no see.

20:15.726 --> 20:17.853
I know what you're gonna say,
but don't say it...

20:17.895 --> 20:20.481
...because I'm not payin' for these drinks.
They're all on the tab.

20:20.564 --> 20:23.401
And I'm gonna see ya Tuesday payday,
I swear on my mother.

20:23.442 --> 20:27.029
Not only on my mother,
but Jesus Christ and-- Okay?

20:27.738 --> 20:30.283
All right, I just want to tell ya
to stay on top of it.

20:30.366 --> 20:32.493
-I will.
-We don't want it to get out of hand.

20:32.577 --> 20:35.913
-Don't worry, it ain't gonna get out of hand.
-I'm doin' it for you.

20:35.955 --> 20:37.373
Come on, have a drink.

20:39.417 --> 20:41.252
The queen!

20:45.798 --> 20:47.258
-You know what the queen said?
-What?

20:47.300 --> 20:49.260
If I had balls I'd be the king.

21:04.650 --> 21:06.819
Hey, they told me you were here,
and you're here.

21:07.445 --> 21:09.780
How are you? How's the classes going?

21:09.947 --> 21:12.408
Okay, Oscar.
How's everything goin' with you?

21:12.783 --> 21:16.120
I was in the basement fixin' the freezer.
Would you believe that?

21:16.454 --> 21:19.749
Charlie, you're a good boy.
Will you tell your uncle I have nothing?

21:19.999 --> 21:21.959
I can't make this week's payment.

21:23.461 --> 21:25.588
Listen, you talk to Giovanni, not me.

21:25.713 --> 21:27.757
I should hand this place over to him,
you know that?

21:27.798 --> 21:29.383
I don't need this aggravation.

21:29.467 --> 21:32.595
He'd rather have the loan paid.
You know that, Oscar.

21:32.970 --> 21:35.056
Your uncle's a good man.
I'm not gonna stick him.

21:35.139 --> 21:37.350
He either gets the money
or he gets the place.

21:37.433 --> 21:39.560
Right now it looks like
he's gettin' the place.

21:39.644 --> 21:40.978
You tell me why I should care.

21:41.020 --> 21:43.898
I got a partner who is a bum.
He disappears!

21:44.106 --> 21:45.900
I don't understand this. Where's Groppi?

21:45.983 --> 21:48.402
I should know? His wife don't even know!

21:48.527 --> 21:51.113
If he don't give a damn,
why should I kill myself?

21:53.616 --> 21:55.576
Thank you very much, Natalie!

22:36.409 --> 22:37.952
How are you feeling?

22:44.709 --> 22:47.795
About that shooting last night,
I was there, Uncle.

22:47.878 --> 22:49.380
No, you were not.

22:51.173 --> 22:53.634
Yes, I must have confused it
with something else.

22:53.718 --> 22:55.344
-Yes, you did.
-Si.

22:56.887 --> 22:58.097
So?

22:58.973 --> 23:00.182
About Oscar.

23:01.058 --> 23:02.935
I think he's puttin' on this act
about the restaurant...

23:03.019 --> 23:04.812
...bein' in bad shape and all that.

23:04.895 --> 23:06.355
He says he can't make the payments.

23:06.397 --> 23:08.566
He says his partner, Groppi,
has disappeared.

23:10.276 --> 23:11.611
What should I do?

23:13.195 --> 23:14.697
Don't do anything.

23:14.989 --> 23:16.407
His business is bad.

23:16.741 --> 23:18.034
Can I help?

23:19.577 --> 23:21.704
Yeah, you can help by waiting.

23:23.164 --> 23:24.957
Don't be impatient.

23:25.249 --> 23:26.584
You like restaurants?

23:27.418 --> 23:28.628
Yes, sure.

23:31.631 --> 23:34.759
Well, you know what I do have?
I got a good buy on toilet paper.

23:38.804 --> 23:39.680
What?

23:39.764 --> 23:41.265
I got stock.

23:41.349 --> 23:43.893
No, I got toilet paper comin' from the PX,
the Army.

23:43.935 --> 23:45.811
Tryin' to steal from the Army, huh?

23:45.937 --> 23:49.065
-I can get it cheap. You want it?
-Steal from the American Army.

23:49.148 --> 23:52.360
-Army of the United States of America.
-Hey, you sell firecrackers?

23:52.443 --> 23:54.278
What? Come here.

23:54.946 --> 23:56.530
-What do ya want?
-Firecrackers.

23:56.614 --> 23:57.865
No, that's illegal.

23:57.949 --> 24:00.368
We just went down to Chinatown.
They don't have any stuff.

24:00.451 --> 24:02.870
Keep away from those chinks.
All they have is shit.

24:02.954 --> 24:04.413
We have $40.

24:04.538 --> 24:06.290
Why didn't you say so?

24:07.708 --> 24:09.961
We don't know if we want to spend all $40.

24:10.044 --> 24:12.588
-You want good stuff or you want shit?
-We want good stuff.

24:12.630 --> 24:14.966
You know where this stuff comes from?
Maryland.

24:15.007 --> 24:17.635
-You know what that means?
-That means it's good.

24:17.969 --> 24:19.720
-Tony, can we borrow your car?
-Sure.

24:19.804 --> 24:21.472
All right, come on. Across the street.

24:21.555 --> 24:22.807
Ya got sparklers?

24:22.890 --> 24:24.976
Cherry bombs? Ash cans?

24:25.142 --> 24:26.894
-Cones?
-Cones, yes.

24:26.978 --> 24:28.062
Women?

24:28.896 --> 24:31.816
-What are you, a comedian?
-Comedians, Tony.

24:42.827 --> 24:44.579
-Nice car.
-Yeah, well.

24:45.830 --> 24:47.331
Must've cost a lot.

24:48.499 --> 24:51.836
You got a good buy on this, didn't ya?
You need a tune-up there.

24:53.045 --> 24:55.172
Did you kids come down here for the feast?

24:56.841 --> 25:00.428
Now what we're gonna do is
let ya out right over there on that corner.

25:00.511 --> 25:02.096
And we're gonna come back for ya.

25:02.179 --> 25:03.431
Can't we come with you?

25:03.514 --> 25:05.975
No. I can't let anybody see
where I got the stuff.

25:06.017 --> 25:08.144
That's good business,
ya know what I'm sayin'?

25:08.185 --> 25:08.936
Yeah.

25:09.020 --> 25:11.022
-Be back in about 30 minutes.
-Okay.

25:11.814 --> 25:14.692
Wait, wait, wait. What about the cash?

25:15.192 --> 25:16.485
Take a check?

25:16.694 --> 25:18.070
Take a check?

25:18.779 --> 25:21.115
-Where are you guys from?
-Riverdale.

25:21.198 --> 25:24.869
Maybe that's what they do up in Riverdale,
but down here we gotta take cash.

25:25.036 --> 25:26.871
Now, ya got it or ya don't got it.

25:28.623 --> 25:30.041
Okay, here.

25:31.709 --> 25:34.921
All right, now wait over there
and keep your mouth shut.

25:41.719 --> 25:44.180
Checks? Tony, you take checks, right?

25:44.388 --> 25:47.058
Sure I take checks. How much did we get?

25:47.224 --> 25:50.561
You know, I don't know.
Let me see here. What do we got here?

25:50.645 --> 25:52.229
What do we got here?

25:57.026 --> 25:59.820
What do you know!
We got stiffed by them kids.

26:00.071 --> 26:01.906
They only gave me $20.

26:03.407 --> 26:04.617
Here.

26:05.785 --> 26:08.079
Take $5. Tell you what:
I'll write you a check.

26:08.120 --> 26:09.830
I'll tell ya what: Get out of the car.

26:09.914 --> 26:11.916
I'll tell you what: Take the $5.

26:11.999 --> 26:13.251
Give me the $5.

26:14.085 --> 26:15.336
Let's go to the movies.

26:15.419 --> 26:16.921
And the movie's on you.

26:17.088 --> 26:19.715
Pull over here. Pull over here.
There he is!

26:20.591 --> 26:21.634
Hey, Michael!

26:21.759 --> 26:23.678
Charlie, get in the car. Come here.

26:23.761 --> 26:24.637
Comin' in?

26:24.720 --> 26:26.389
Nah, come here.

26:26.430 --> 26:28.933
So, I'll see ya tomorrow, right?
Frankie, be good.

26:31.435 --> 26:34.063
-What's the matter?
-We just stiffed a couple of kids.

26:34.146 --> 26:35.898
-How much ya take 'em for?
-$20.

26:35.940 --> 26:38.943
What are you laughin' about? $20?
Let's go to the movies.

26:39.777 --> 26:42.446
-That's right and you pay.
-What are you talkin' about?

26:42.530 --> 26:43.990
It's my business.

26:58.963 --> 27:00.798
You guys better enjoy yourselves.

27:01.090 --> 27:02.800
It's costin' me a lot of money.

27:02.883 --> 27:05.511
Hey, get down. Leave me alone!

27:07.597 --> 27:10.016
Shut up, give me a break,
I'm tryin' to watch the picture.

27:10.099 --> 27:13.811
You watch it. I'll get the manager in here.
He'll throw ya out in the street!

27:13.894 --> 27:16.105
Go ahead. Go get the fuckin' manager!

27:16.147 --> 27:17.607
-He's a fruit!
-You're a fruit!

27:17.648 --> 27:19.692
Me? I'm no fruit!

27:28.034 --> 27:32.330
It feels good, huh, Charlie?
Streets are empty. Nice, thank God.

27:32.371 --> 27:35.249
With that feast on, ya can't even move
in your own neighborhood.

27:35.333 --> 27:37.126
I hate that feast with a passion.

27:37.168 --> 27:38.502
Never mind the feast!

27:38.586 --> 27:40.338
Just remember, I'll do the talkin'.

27:40.421 --> 27:42.256
That's the trouble.

27:42.506 --> 27:45.134
Don't fool around, John.
Jimmy asked me to settle this.

27:45.217 --> 27:46.636
How much do they owe him?

27:46.677 --> 27:48.262
I don't know, a couple of hundred.

27:48.346 --> 27:51.474
Look at this character!

27:51.682 --> 27:53.643
He's probably the next judge!

27:54.185 --> 27:55.436
He's the mayor's aide.

27:55.519 --> 27:57.939
-Where's he gonna meet us?
-In the pool room.

27:58.022 --> 27:59.607
Where is it, near Sullivan's?

27:59.690 --> 28:02.151
No, it's on King Street. What are ya doin'?

28:02.235 --> 28:03.945
Show me where to go.
I don't know my way around.

28:04.028 --> 28:07.573
Make a right turn over here
when the light turns green.

28:10.034 --> 28:11.911
Next time, we don't bet
outside the neighborhood.

28:11.994 --> 28:15.581
Come on with this light. What is this,
a coffee and cake light over here?

28:16.582 --> 28:19.168
Why don't you get farther away
from the car please?

28:24.215 --> 28:27.301
It'll be okay. I know these guys.
They're not gonna stiff him.

28:27.635 --> 28:28.803
How do you know?

28:28.886 --> 28:30.930
Keep your mouth shut. I'll take care of it.

28:31.013 --> 28:34.016
-Just don't say nothin'.
-I'm not sayin' nothin'.

28:35.059 --> 28:37.186
-Where the fuck is he?
-Here he is.

28:38.229 --> 28:39.313
Charlie.

28:41.023 --> 28:42.900
The number I bet was 235.

28:42.984 --> 28:45.236
I bet a combination
'cause I dreamt of my grandfather.

28:45.319 --> 28:47.905
-How much did you bet on that?
-What did I say?

28:50.992 --> 28:52.868
Clark, you seen Joey Gatucci around?

28:52.994 --> 28:54.912
Yeah, he's in the back room.

28:55.830 --> 28:58.624
When he died, the number
on the funeral parlor was 235...

28:58.708 --> 29:01.877
...so I figured that would be a good bet,
you know?

29:03.421 --> 29:07.049
Well, well, well, Saint Charles is here.
Everybody, benediction!

29:07.592 --> 29:09.760
Hey, you may rise. Rise, please.

29:09.927 --> 29:12.263
Thank you.
My good friend, Tootie, over here.

29:16.517 --> 29:19.228
-You can't lose with that.
-How about Mushy?

29:19.437 --> 29:21.480
Mushy! Vote for the lamp!

29:22.273 --> 29:24.817
Mushy, this will definitely
get you to Hollywood.

29:26.277 --> 29:28.905
Chalkboard, the pool cues!

29:28.946 --> 29:31.949
How about the balls? Bless my balls.

29:32.116 --> 29:33.743
Bless his balls!

29:35.328 --> 29:37.538
-How ya been, Joey?
-All right.

29:37.622 --> 29:39.582
Looks like ya took off a couple of tons.

29:40.625 --> 29:42.460
What brings ya down here, Charlie?

29:44.211 --> 29:47.632
Look, Joey, on Friday the 25th
I placed a bet with Sally.

29:47.715 --> 29:49.258
-Never heard of it.
-Never heard of it?

29:49.342 --> 29:52.136
Never heard of Sally.
Who the fuck is Sally?

29:52.303 --> 29:54.263
Oh, Joey, really.

29:54.305 --> 29:57.516
Come on, we're all friends here.
Now let's cut the bullshit, huh?

30:02.647 --> 30:04.565
You know you got a good friend here.

30:04.649 --> 30:05.566
Wonderful.

30:05.650 --> 30:07.610
Come to think of it, I do remember now.

30:07.652 --> 30:09.987
All we need. That guy is a real scumbag.

30:10.029 --> 30:11.280
Wanna shut up?

30:11.364 --> 30:15.201
Hey, Friday's a busy day.
A mistake can be made, ya know?

30:15.326 --> 30:17.286
-All right, no problem.
-All right.

30:17.370 --> 30:19.288
I forget myself, too, sometimes.

30:19.330 --> 30:21.332
-Okay, let's have a drink.
-Good enough.

30:21.374 --> 30:24.543
Come on, now let's have a drink.
Jimmy, Tony, finish the rack.

30:24.627 --> 30:26.379
-Who's buyin'?
-Me.

30:42.019 --> 30:43.854
Can I have a beer, Joey?

30:44.021 --> 30:45.982
-Go ahead.
-Nah, I got scotch here.

30:46.232 --> 30:47.692
I got a dry throat.

30:47.942 --> 30:49.735
Where did ya get the hat?

30:49.944 --> 30:53.656
Ya like this hat? This is a $25 Dobbs hat.

30:54.073 --> 30:56.033
Where did ya get those sneakers?

30:56.158 --> 30:58.035
These are $2 sneakers.

30:59.954 --> 31:02.248
Why don't ya lower the jukebox?
I can't hear nothin'.

31:02.331 --> 31:04.834
Hey, the girls like the music loud.

31:05.459 --> 31:08.004
Girls? You call those skanks girls?

31:09.547 --> 31:11.674
Hey, what's the matter with this kid, huh?

31:11.757 --> 31:14.302
Ain't nothin' wrong with me.
I'm feelin' fine.

31:14.385 --> 31:17.305
-Keep your mouth shut.
-You tellin' me that in front of this asshole?

31:17.388 --> 31:20.099
All right. We're not gonna pay,
we're not payin'.

31:20.891 --> 31:22.852
Why? We just said
we're gonna have a drink.

31:22.935 --> 31:25.229
We're not payin' because this guy...

31:25.896 --> 31:27.732
...this guy's a fuckin' mook.

31:27.940 --> 31:29.275
But I didn't say nothin'.

31:29.358 --> 31:31.235
And we don't pay mooks.

31:32.445 --> 31:34.280
A mook? I'm a mook?

31:34.405 --> 31:35.448
Yeah.

31:36.073 --> 31:37.074
What's a mook?

31:37.241 --> 31:38.326
What's a mook?

31:38.409 --> 31:39.994
-I don't know.
-What's a mook?

31:41.078 --> 31:42.330
You can't call me a mook.

31:42.413 --> 31:43.372
I can't?

31:43.539 --> 31:44.624
No!

31:46.918 --> 31:48.377
I'll give you mook!

32:00.932 --> 32:02.767
Come on, I got a bad hand!

33:30.187 --> 33:32.148
What's the matter with you, Joey?

33:49.248 --> 33:51.334
-Hey, Officer. Can I get my hat?
-No.

33:51.500 --> 33:53.878
-Can I call my wife?
-Nope.

34:00.968 --> 34:02.386
What ya got here?

34:02.720 --> 34:04.055
That's a nail file.

34:04.138 --> 34:06.057
-That's a knife.
-No.

34:06.140 --> 34:08.391
-This is a knife.
-No, it's got a toothpick in there.

34:08.476 --> 34:11.520
Davis, Davis this is very embarrassing.

34:12.063 --> 34:14.565
Look, how long have I known ya,
Davis, huh?

34:14.649 --> 34:17.652
You've never seen fights like this.
These are my friends.

34:17.735 --> 34:20.487
-This is my cousin, Charlie. We're friends.
-Friends.

34:20.571 --> 34:21.530
Your cousin?

34:21.614 --> 34:23.032
-Where you from?
-East Side.

34:23.074 --> 34:25.076
The East Side. What is this, a knife?

34:25.117 --> 34:28.788
No! It's got a toothpick in there.
You see over there?

34:28.871 --> 34:30.956
Davis, come here. I wanna talk to ya.

34:31.040 --> 34:33.167
You coverin' for the East Side
or the West Side?

34:33.251 --> 34:37.088
-Let me just talk to ya over here a minute.
-What are ya gonna say about this knife?

34:37.170 --> 34:39.090
-It's a harmless penknife.
-Harmless?

34:39.130 --> 34:41.509
It's a dangerous weapon!
Do you know the penalty?

34:41.592 --> 34:44.428
-I'm sure we can settle this.
-How are we gonna settle this?

34:44.844 --> 34:47.556
-Let me give you some car fare.
-All right.

34:47.598 --> 34:50.101
Took ya a long time. Where ya goin'?

34:50.309 --> 34:52.061
-New Jersey.
-New Jersey.

34:52.228 --> 34:54.105
Okay, here.
This is for you and your partner--

34:54.188 --> 34:55.606
Goin' to Philadelphia.

34:57.608 --> 34:58.609
Here.

34:58.818 --> 35:00.528
-Thank you.
-Okay.

35:00.611 --> 35:02.738
Thanks a lot, Davis.

35:02.947 --> 35:04.073
Here.

35:05.241 --> 35:06.909
Johnny, come on.

35:10.454 --> 35:14.083
And you guys here, listen.
No more of this fooling around, huh?

35:14.166 --> 35:16.586
You guys'll get hurt like that. All right?

35:16.669 --> 35:17.795
Okay.

35:18.337 --> 35:20.006
So long, Davis.

35:21.007 --> 35:24.385
-Come on, let's have a drink.
-Come on, let's have a drink, everybody.

35:24.969 --> 35:26.596
Who were those mooks that jumped us?

35:26.637 --> 35:28.973
Every day is Christmas with these cops.

35:31.350 --> 35:34.645
We were gonna pay ya.
We just don't like bein' pushed around.

35:35.146 --> 35:38.065
-Come on, Joey, we're pushin' you around?
-Yeah!

35:38.691 --> 35:40.526
Let's have a drink and forget about it.

35:40.610 --> 35:42.403
This is the drink we never had before.

35:42.486 --> 35:43.821
Come on, salute.

35:43.988 --> 35:45.239
Salute.

35:51.162 --> 35:53.289
All right, there's your money.

35:55.791 --> 35:57.543
You don't have to count it. It's all there.

35:57.627 --> 35:59.503
No, you go ahead and count it.

35:59.629 --> 36:02.173
Hey, come on, no bullshit, friends.

36:02.673 --> 36:05.134
Hey, don't fuckin' touch me, scumbag.

36:11.557 --> 36:13.351
Fuck ya all!

36:19.023 --> 36:20.733
That's for you!

36:21.108 --> 36:22.360
Up your ass!

36:23.194 --> 36:26.614
Come back here again,
you'll find out what's gonna happen to ya.

36:26.697 --> 36:28.449
Fuckin' douche bags!

36:29.408 --> 36:30.618
Mook, Johnny.

36:32.078 --> 36:33.704
Stop with the mook.

36:34.330 --> 36:36.165
Look at that, look at that.

36:37.041 --> 36:38.668
Don't touch it, it hurts.

36:38.876 --> 36:41.629
-Ya got somethin' we can put on it?
-Yeah, I got somethin'.

36:41.879 --> 36:44.548
-First, I wanna show ya somethin'.
-What does mook mean?

36:44.632 --> 36:46.050
Hey, Jimmy. Mook.

36:50.054 --> 36:52.682
Okay, baby, just relax. Take it easy, okay?

36:57.061 --> 36:58.729
You're supposed to be workin'.

36:58.980 --> 37:00.898
Tony, give me a break. I've got a girl.

37:01.232 --> 37:02.566
Yeah, go out and work.

37:03.901 --> 37:05.570
Charlie, give him a break.

37:05.653 --> 37:07.238
Close the door, George.

37:09.156 --> 37:11.367
Okay. Before we take care of you.

37:11.450 --> 37:14.036
There's somethin' I gotta show you.
Watch this.

37:19.625 --> 37:20.710
Oh, hey!

37:20.876 --> 37:22.086
Where did ya get this?

37:22.169 --> 37:23.879
Look at the size of these guys!

37:23.921 --> 37:25.548
Tony, you gotta be kiddin' me!

37:26.507 --> 37:30.136
Look at this one. That's beautiful.
That panther. Where did you get this?

37:30.219 --> 37:32.346
How many pounds of meat you feed him?

37:32.597 --> 37:35.182
Keep quiet about this.
I don't have a license for him yet.

37:35.266 --> 37:36.225
Where did you get him?

37:36.267 --> 37:39.729
Nobody can go near him but me.
I'm the only one who can feed him.

37:39.937 --> 37:40.855
Watch.

37:40.980 --> 37:44.025
-You got their claws taken out or what?
-What are ya doin'?

37:47.028 --> 37:49.030
-You crazy or what?
-Be careful.

37:49.113 --> 37:51.157
What are you, out of your mind, Tony?

37:51.365 --> 37:54.660
What are ya doin', cowards?
No wonder Italy lost the war.

37:54.744 --> 37:56.245
Here's Daddy, here's Daddy.

37:56.370 --> 37:57.914
Tony, be careful.

37:58.289 --> 38:02.251
I really wanted to get a tiger, Charlie.
Ol' William Blake and all that.

39:09.068 --> 39:11.320
You believe anything anybody says.

39:11.404 --> 39:14.365
That's right, I believe anybody.
That's my charm.

39:14.782 --> 39:16.867
Some charm, pops.

39:19.412 --> 39:22.582
-What about the time you went on retreat?
-What about it?

39:24.542 --> 39:26.627
Charlie goes on this retreat.

39:26.752 --> 39:30.089
He tells me this story about this priest
who used to...

39:30.381 --> 39:33.259
...let this couple borrow his car for dates.

39:34.260 --> 39:36.721
They didn't make it,
'cause they weren't married.

39:36.762 --> 39:40.057
But, two weeks before the marriage,
they decided to make it.

39:40.391 --> 39:43.978
So, they pull over to the side of the road
in the priest's car.

39:45.062 --> 39:47.898
Boom! Mack truck comes along,
and they're both killed.

39:55.156 --> 39:58.034
That's great. That's true?
This really happened?

39:58.117 --> 39:59.452
No, wait.

40:00.745 --> 40:02.580
Charlie believes it.

40:03.122 --> 40:05.875
I tell him two years before that...

40:06.083 --> 40:09.420
...I went on a retreat
and the priest tells me the same story.

40:09.754 --> 40:12.381
It's a different priest,
it's the exact same story.

40:12.757 --> 40:14.175
-So that--
-Ya get it?

40:14.258 --> 40:16.552
Yeah, you mean the story ain't true, right?

40:19.430 --> 40:22.934
Yeah, but the point is, he's really upset.

40:23.935 --> 40:25.770
But he don't understand...

40:26.103 --> 40:29.941
...it's a business, it's work,
it's an organization.

40:30.107 --> 40:32.944
You got a way about talkin'
about one thing and then zap...

40:33.027 --> 40:36.864
...you slide right into somethin' else
that nobody's even supposed to notice.

40:36.948 --> 40:38.783
I was mad because they lied to me.

40:38.950 --> 40:41.994
I'm gonna tell ya one thing:
I ain't never goin' on no retreat.

40:42.078 --> 40:43.246
Never.

40:43.579 --> 40:46.207
Why do you let those guys get to you?

40:46.666 --> 40:48.876
'Cause they're supposed to be guys.

40:48.960 --> 40:52.088
Hey, listen, that's where you and I differ.
What can I tell ya?

40:53.214 --> 40:54.799
You want me to say it?

40:55.508 --> 40:57.468
You gotta be like me.

41:00.721 --> 41:02.139
You wanna be saved.

41:14.068 --> 41:15.570
Bar's closed, kid.

41:16.320 --> 41:17.905
I'm just waitin' for Joey.

41:19.156 --> 41:20.866
All right, sit down.

41:46.475 --> 41:48.102
I gotta go to the bathroom.

41:49.312 --> 41:52.189
So, go ahead. What do ya want,
somebody to hold it for ya?

41:52.273 --> 41:54.108
-Jesus!
-What a jerk off!

41:57.028 --> 41:58.571
Charlie, hold it for him.

42:01.490 --> 42:03.034
George....

42:04.869 --> 42:06.203
You wanna do somethin'?

42:06.245 --> 42:08.331
Yeah...you know how he gets.

42:08.414 --> 42:10.124
You know how my chairs get?

42:17.006 --> 42:18.549
Jesus, this guy!

42:18.633 --> 42:20.676
This place is really gettin' depressin'.

42:20.760 --> 42:22.219
That's an understatement.

42:22.345 --> 42:23.930
If I had my place, every night...

42:24.013 --> 42:26.891
...I'd get bums like this down,
have things happen.

42:26.974 --> 42:29.352
Call it somethin' like Season of the Witch.
Get it?

42:29.393 --> 42:30.519
-Got it.
-Good.

42:30.645 --> 42:31.938
Bullshit!

42:32.396 --> 42:36.609
Who's talkin' bullshit? Who's the guy
with William Blake and the tigers?

42:37.109 --> 42:40.947
Hey, come on. Will you guys shut up
with the tigers and the witches over here?

42:41.030 --> 42:42.657
Come on. Let's get out of here.

42:42.740 --> 42:44.033
Come on, close the place.

42:44.075 --> 42:46.410
I'll get outta here
when the place is ready to close.

42:46.494 --> 42:49.413
Why don't ya close it now?
We get out of here, get somethin' to eat.

42:49.497 --> 42:51.332
When everybody leaves, we close.

42:51.916 --> 42:54.835
Don't forget what's-his-name
in the bathroom.

42:56.504 --> 42:59.507
Charlie, come here.
Look at the picture of yourself.

43:02.134 --> 43:04.971
Not quite, but keep tryin'. Dummkopf.

43:08.307 --> 43:10.559
-Ya wanna have a game after we close?
-No.

43:10.643 --> 43:12.687
Yeah, come on. For how much?

43:12.937 --> 43:14.313
Scumbag!

43:14.397 --> 43:16.065
Hey, don't call me no scumbag.

43:16.107 --> 43:18.192
You can't pay what you owe.
As soon as a game shows up...

43:18.276 --> 43:19.986
...bang! You wanna jump in.

43:20.069 --> 43:21.445
''For how much?''

43:21.946 --> 43:24.031
Why don't you use your head?

43:25.700 --> 43:29.203
Hey, hold it! What's the matter
with you guys? We're friends!

43:32.123 --> 43:33.916
What the fuck is wrong with you?

43:33.958 --> 43:36.919
-Me? He's callin' me a scumbag!
-You, too!

43:37.003 --> 43:39.213
-All right, enough!
-Fuckin' moron!

43:44.885 --> 43:48.097
Go ahead. Hit each other
with the fuckin' chairs, why don't ya?

43:51.017 --> 43:53.436
-Come on, we gonna go eat now?
-All right, enough.

43:53.477 --> 43:55.146
You oughta know better than that.

43:55.229 --> 43:56.647
I'm sorry.

43:57.315 --> 43:58.441
Sorry.

43:59.275 --> 44:01.444
I'm sorry, Tony. I'm sorry.

44:03.779 --> 44:06.449
-Wanna play a little cards?
-No.

44:12.663 --> 44:14.874
Anybody wanna have a game?

44:18.002 --> 44:21.422
Michael, I've got a game
you cannot say no to.

44:21.881 --> 44:23.049
No.

44:23.424 --> 44:24.800
You said no.

44:25.843 --> 44:27.178
Lot of sports.

44:32.099 --> 44:33.476
A little blackjack?

45:38.374 --> 45:39.667
Somebody get the gun!

45:47.883 --> 45:49.135
Everybody out!

45:49.510 --> 45:50.928
George, kill the lights!

46:04.108 --> 46:06.235
Don't run!

46:06.319 --> 46:07.445
Don't run!

46:10.573 --> 46:11.866
Don't run!

46:14.994 --> 46:16.537
Don't run!

46:18.623 --> 46:19.874
Don't run!

46:21.292 --> 46:23.794
George, where are you goin'?
Where's your car?

46:26.297 --> 46:27.632
Mikey!

46:29.342 --> 46:31.177
Michael, let us go with you.

46:31.260 --> 46:33.095
Hey, chauffeur!

46:33.679 --> 46:35.431
-Hey, chauffeur--
-Shut up, will ya?

46:36.140 --> 46:37.725
Shut up, I'll ask him.

46:37.975 --> 46:40.978
Uptown, James. Come on, you guys.
Hurry up. Where are we gonna go?

46:41.062 --> 46:42.313
Michael, give us a lift.

46:42.396 --> 46:45.358
Get outta here. Get the fuck outta here!

46:45.524 --> 46:47.818
Hey, get outta here!

46:49.237 --> 46:51.072
You're startin' to make too much noise.

46:51.155 --> 46:53.491
Let me in. I'm standin' out here in the rain.

46:53.574 --> 46:55.117
What's the matter with you guys?

46:55.159 --> 46:58.829
Hey, stay there. Come on, get away.
Get outta here. Move over.

47:01.415 --> 47:03.918
Hey, where are we?
Come on, where are we?

47:05.211 --> 47:07.171
Sammy, will you behave yourself?

47:07.255 --> 47:09.882
I'm so sorry.
It's just that he's terribly frightened.

47:09.966 --> 47:11.759
Just keep him quiet, all right?

47:12.802 --> 47:14.011
Are these friends of yours?

47:14.303 --> 47:15.721
What are you, a comedian?

47:16.847 --> 47:19.016
I can't get over the way
he kept goin' at him.

47:19.100 --> 47:21.769
Yeah, must've been
all that liquor in him, boy.

47:22.687 --> 47:23.854
Chetarsi!

47:23.938 --> 47:26.607
Yeah, chetarsi.
You know what chetarsi means, Sammy?

47:26.941 --> 47:28.901
Sounds like somethin' dirty.

47:29.193 --> 47:30.987
What are you lookin' at?

47:31.237 --> 47:33.531
What are we doin' with these faggots?
Throw them out.

47:33.573 --> 47:34.448
Are ya nuts?

47:34.532 --> 47:37.868
What do ya want me to do,
leave 'em in front of Tony's place?

47:38.244 --> 47:40.871
Hey, Benton, look at that number. Wow!

47:41.038 --> 47:42.832
-Hey, beautiful!
-Hey, shut up!

47:42.915 --> 47:44.375
Hey! Keep it down!

47:44.458 --> 47:45.710
-Quiet.
-What's the matter?

47:50.631 --> 47:52.049
Sammy, behave yourself.

47:52.091 --> 47:55.094
I won't. I won't. Why should I?

47:55.678 --> 47:57.680
Let me out of this car!

47:58.889 --> 48:00.224
Look at that one!

48:00.266 --> 48:01.517
Oh, my God!

48:01.726 --> 48:03.853
Hey, baby, got any meat?

48:04.145 --> 48:08.858
Hey, baby, I want to suck on that! Baby!
I want to suck on that, baby!

48:10.526 --> 48:12.069
I want it all!

48:14.280 --> 48:16.490
Get 'em outta here! All right, that's it.

48:16.991 --> 48:18.117
Get outta here!

48:19.911 --> 48:20.786
Hey, don't push!

48:21.746 --> 48:23.414
What do ya mean, get out?

48:23.539 --> 48:24.415
Get out!

48:24.707 --> 48:26.334
I just got in!

48:26.709 --> 48:28.294
-Go, go!
-Get out!

48:28.377 --> 48:29.545
-Animals!
-Take it easy.

48:29.629 --> 48:32.048
All right, just a minute, please!

48:34.800 --> 48:36.677
-Good goin', Mike. Thanks.
-See ya around.

48:36.761 --> 48:38.554
Hey, wait a minute. What is this?

48:39.472 --> 48:41.140
Hey, fellas, ya goin' my way?

48:41.641 --> 48:42.934
Come on, knucklehead.

48:43.601 --> 48:45.603
What's your problem?

48:45.937 --> 48:47.521
Those two bastards.

48:50.983 --> 48:52.818
Hey, look at the piece, John.

48:54.153 --> 48:56.614
It's one of those little jobs
cops carry in their sock.

48:56.697 --> 48:59.200
Yeah, cop beat me on the head
with one of those.

48:59.283 --> 49:01.953
Remember that time I got beaten
from those cops?

49:02.119 --> 49:04.538
Yeah, you recovered from that one,
didn't ya?

49:04.705 --> 49:06.374
I never recovered.

49:06.707 --> 49:09.335
If I wasn't there to be used
as a punching bag...

49:09.418 --> 49:11.420
...in order for you to leave fast--

49:11.504 --> 49:15.466
That's because you're stupid.
You should've ran and left safely with me.

49:15.800 --> 49:18.302
With you?
I'm stupid for gettin' my head punched in?

49:18.386 --> 49:19.428
You schweinehund!

49:23.307 --> 49:24.850
My hand, my bad hand!

49:25.810 --> 49:27.144
Wait a minute!

49:27.186 --> 49:28.271
What are you doin'?

49:28.312 --> 49:29.981
Joey Barker.

49:30.064 --> 49:32.858
Joey Barker. I owe him money.

49:35.403 --> 49:37.780
-I don't think that's him.
-Yeah, it's him.

49:38.322 --> 49:39.448
Where is he?

49:39.615 --> 49:40.866
He's turned the corner.

49:41.867 --> 49:42.702
Is he gone?

49:43.077 --> 49:44.161
He turned the corner.

49:44.287 --> 49:45.454
That don't mean he's gone.

49:45.788 --> 49:49.500
Come on, get over here. He turned
the corner. What's the matter with you?

50:05.641 --> 50:06.726
What's the matter?

50:10.271 --> 50:12.356
You can't go home like that. Stay with me.

50:12.440 --> 50:13.691
Is your mother there?

50:13.774 --> 50:16.110
No, she's on the island
carin' for my grandmother.

50:16.193 --> 50:18.613
Hey, let's get some bread
from my uncle's store.

50:20.573 --> 50:22.491
-I'm sick about my hat.
-Here.

50:26.245 --> 50:27.955
Your grandma's gonna die, right?

50:29.040 --> 50:29.999
Yeah, right.

50:31.459 --> 50:32.793
Did you like her?

50:33.461 --> 50:35.546
What do ya mean? She's my grandmother.

50:35.630 --> 50:37.298
So what? That don't mean nothin'.

50:37.423 --> 50:38.549
So what?

50:38.883 --> 50:41.802
-What's the matter with you?
-What's the matter with you?

50:43.137 --> 50:46.140
Anyway, she ain't dead yet,
God forbid. So, shut up.

50:47.725 --> 50:49.018
Charlie!

50:49.936 --> 50:52.396
You ain't got nothin' to eat over here.

50:52.438 --> 50:54.148
I could've told you that before.

50:54.231 --> 50:56.943
Got nothin'.
I tell you, I know what we do.

50:57.276 --> 50:59.320
-What do ya want?
-Tell you what we do.

51:00.780 --> 51:02.782
I'll go to my aunt's. She's got lots of food.

51:02.865 --> 51:05.701
She has food all the time.
I'll go through the fire escape.

51:05.743 --> 51:06.619
Don't do that!

51:06.702 --> 51:09.664
You'll scare your cousin, Teresa,
if you go in there that way.

51:10.498 --> 51:13.668
Oh, that's right, yeah.
Hey, you know what we can do?

51:14.001 --> 51:16.212
She can have a seizure.
Then we can watch.

51:16.254 --> 51:19.507
That's not funny.
You gonna be a jerk off all your life?

51:20.675 --> 51:22.093
Grow up, huh?

51:22.802 --> 51:26.013
You want some food from your aunt,
go and knock on her door.

51:26.097 --> 51:27.598
Yeah, yeah, I know.

51:27.682 --> 51:28.724
Go to sleep.

51:28.933 --> 51:31.435
Besides, where are you goin'
at six o'clock in the morning?

51:32.812 --> 51:34.188
I don't know.

52:11.225 --> 52:13.227
Did ya say your prayers?

52:13.561 --> 52:16.564
Very funny, ha-ha.
Hey, why don't ya tuck me in, sweetie?

52:30.870 --> 52:33.706
Teresa, I had a dream last night
about you and me.

52:34.040 --> 52:38.002
I gotta tell you this.
We're in this room and we're both naked.

52:38.169 --> 52:42.298
And there's this huge white bed and
you're lyin' on it and I'm standin' over ya.

52:42.757 --> 52:45.843
And we're just about to make love
and I come.

52:46.928 --> 52:49.263
The only thing is, I come blood.

52:50.765 --> 52:52.934
And blood went all over the place!

52:53.142 --> 52:57.521
Squirtin' all over the place, all over you,
all over me, my hands, and everything.

52:57.605 --> 52:59.106
I don't think that's funny.

53:00.274 --> 53:02.693
Girls bother me.
They got no sense of humor.

53:02.735 --> 53:03.819
Well, I'm a girl.

53:03.903 --> 53:05.404
Do you like me?

53:06.405 --> 53:07.740
Yeah, I like you.

53:08.074 --> 53:09.408
I love you.

53:11.077 --> 53:12.745
Well, I don't love you.

53:13.079 --> 53:14.080
We'll see.

53:14.997 --> 53:17.124
Hey, forget it.

53:17.541 --> 53:21.254
If there was a chance of me fallin' in love
with you, I wouldn't be here right now.

53:21.337 --> 53:22.672
Because?

53:23.297 --> 53:25.091
Because with you, I can't get involved.

53:25.258 --> 53:27.677
-Because?
-Because you're a cunt.

53:28.386 --> 53:31.013
-It was a joke.
-Where do you get off talkin' like that?

53:31.097 --> 53:33.557
It was only a joke, for Christ's sake.
Hey, come here.

53:33.641 --> 53:34.934
Hell it was.

53:36.060 --> 53:38.854
What are ya standin'
in front of the window like that for?

53:38.896 --> 53:41.899
Someone might see you.
Get over here. Come on.

53:43.609 --> 53:46.445
Go ahead. Jump out the fuckin' window.

53:48.030 --> 53:49.156
Don't look.

53:51.951 --> 53:53.160
Don't look.

53:54.245 --> 53:58.082
-You really don't want me to look?
-Yeah, I really don't want you to look.

54:18.102 --> 54:19.145
I see what you're doing.

54:21.689 --> 54:22.732
I saw you!

54:23.024 --> 54:24.942
What? I wasn't doin' nothin'.

54:34.952 --> 54:37.163
You wild woman.

54:37.747 --> 54:38.748
Let me alone!

54:39.206 --> 54:42.126
-Get your hands off me!
-Let go of me!

54:45.671 --> 54:47.048
You're killing me.

54:49.258 --> 54:51.052
You should've seen it. Unbelievable!

54:54.013 --> 54:56.098
Kid went right to the bathroom
and shot him.

54:56.182 --> 54:58.225
Guy was just comin' at him like Rasputin.

54:58.309 --> 55:00.019
Oh, and that kid was scared!

55:00.227 --> 55:01.562
We were more scared!

55:01.729 --> 55:05.316
It doesn't make any sense. He shot him
just because he insulted Mario?

55:05.566 --> 55:07.235
It wasn't anything personal?

55:08.569 --> 55:10.571
The kid's a climber, not very bright.

55:10.905 --> 55:14.492
He kills a guy who insulted a big man,
gets a reputation and thinks he's made it.

55:14.575 --> 55:15.701
It's still sick.

55:15.993 --> 55:17.703
Not sick, just stupid.

55:18.371 --> 55:20.831
Which reminds me,
last night Johnny decided...

55:20.873 --> 55:23.626
...to break into your mother's house
and get some food.

55:25.878 --> 55:28.547
-So, why didn't you let him?
-Oh, that's funny.

55:30.091 --> 55:32.426
Put that shit down. What are you doin'?

55:32.927 --> 55:34.136
What's the matter with you?

55:34.595 --> 55:36.514
He doesn't know anything about us,
does he?

55:37.139 --> 55:38.182
-Really?
-No.

55:38.266 --> 55:39.934
I don't want him to know.

55:40.768 --> 55:42.979
Nobody knows anything.
Your reputation's safe.

55:43.062 --> 55:45.690
Hey, come on, smile. What's the matter?

55:45.773 --> 55:49.944
You look like you wanna kill me.
Wanna kill me? Go ahead, kill me.

55:56.617 --> 55:58.077
You can make up the room now.

55:58.411 --> 56:00.871
-I only got two hands.
-Well, use 'em.

56:01.080 --> 56:03.165
-Cut that out, will ya?
-I hate shit like that.

56:03.249 --> 56:04.500
Excuse me, ma'am.

56:06.127 --> 56:08.546
-You got some mouth, you know that?
-Kiss me.

56:08.796 --> 56:10.131
I'll give ya a zap.

56:35.823 --> 56:37.742
-Hash, how ya feelin'?
-Pretty good.

56:37.992 --> 56:38.826
My uncle out back?

56:39.160 --> 56:40.828
Yeah, I think he's busy right now.

56:41.495 --> 56:44.749
Hey, Charlie,
bet a 4-6-3 combination today.

56:45.750 --> 56:47.209
Yeah, thanks.

57:15.863 --> 57:17.114
What are you talkin' about?

57:18.699 --> 57:21.035
There was no insult. I know the kid.
He was drunk.

57:21.118 --> 57:23.037
He made a fool of himself, not me.

57:23.371 --> 57:24.872
Nobody had to shoot him.

58:14.672 --> 58:16.841
I hate the sun. Let's go inside, will ya?

58:16.924 --> 58:18.259
What else do you hate?

58:18.509 --> 58:22.430
I hate the ocean, and I hate the beach,
and I hate the sun.

58:23.264 --> 58:27.101
And the grass and the trees
and I hate heat!

58:27.518 --> 58:29.145
-Charlie?
-What?

58:29.645 --> 58:30.771
What do you like?

58:31.105 --> 58:34.942
I like spaghetti with clam sauce.
Mountains.

58:37.570 --> 58:39.947
Francis of Assisi.

58:40.031 --> 58:42.033
Chicken with lemon and garlic.

58:43.576 --> 58:44.577
John Wayne.

58:44.911 --> 58:47.246
You know, there aren't any mountains
in Manhattan.

58:47.413 --> 58:49.957
Tall buildings. Same thing. And I like you.

59:02.178 --> 59:03.971
I like it here alone.

59:07.308 --> 59:11.062
You know, I'm really going
to take that apartment...the one uptown.

59:11.187 --> 59:13.105
-Are you?
-Yeah, I'm really gonna do it.

59:13.564 --> 59:14.523
Why don't ya this time?

59:14.607 --> 59:18.277
I'm gonna. The hell with my parents.
I just can't take it anymore.

59:19.111 --> 59:20.780
I think it would be a good move.

59:20.905 --> 59:22.198
And I'm gonna do it.

59:22.782 --> 59:24.116
So what are ya waitin' for?

59:24.575 --> 59:25.826
For you.

59:26.327 --> 59:29.747
Teresa, now ya can't wait for me.

59:29.830 --> 59:32.583
I'm closin' in on somethin'
in the neighborhood. I gotta stay.

59:32.667 --> 59:33.834
What are you afraid of?

59:34.252 --> 59:38.172
Afraid? What are ya talkin' about, afraid?
Go on. What's stoppin' you?

59:38.506 --> 59:41.676
You say you're not afraid of your parents,
so go ahead, move out.

59:42.301 --> 59:43.886
All I've got is the neighborhood.

59:43.970 --> 59:45.137
What about me?

59:45.471 --> 59:48.933
The neighborhood and the guys--
That's all that's important to me right now.

59:49.016 --> 59:50.810
Right, guys like my cousin, Johnny.

59:51.143 --> 59:52.812
No, not exactly your cousin, Johnny.

59:53.145 --> 59:55.398
Well, I hope not, because he is crazy!

59:55.606 --> 59:58.693
He's drivin' me nuts.
How can you be with him all the time?

59:58.776 --> 01:00:00.111
He's like an insane person!

01:00:00.194 --> 01:00:01.195
What's wrong with you?

01:00:01.279 --> 01:00:03.656
How can you talk that way
about your own cousin?

01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:05.741
That's terrible.

01:00:07.702 --> 01:00:09.829
Who's gonna help him if I don't?

01:00:09.912 --> 01:00:12.123
It's supposed to matter.
Nobody tries anymore.

01:00:12.248 --> 01:00:13.124
Tries what?

01:00:13.291 --> 01:00:17.003
Just tries to help, that's all.
To help people.

01:00:17.253 --> 01:00:18.546
You help yourself first.

01:00:18.629 --> 01:00:21.007
Bullshit, Teresa.
That's where you're all wrong!

01:00:21.090 --> 01:00:23.134
Francis of Assisi had it all down.

01:00:23.217 --> 01:00:25.469
-He knew.
-What are you talkin' about?

01:00:25.553 --> 01:00:28.472
-He knew.
-What are you talkin' about?

01:00:28.514 --> 01:00:30.558
Saint Francis didn't run numbers.

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:34.562
Me, neither. I don't run numbers.

01:00:55.833 --> 01:00:57.335
Diane, how're you feeling?

01:00:57.627 --> 01:00:59.337
Fine. Excuse me, please.

01:00:59.837 --> 01:01:03.966
You know, Diane, I've been wanting
to talk to you for a while now.

01:01:04.508 --> 01:01:05.801
Excuse me.

01:01:08.179 --> 01:01:10.598
Besides all that jokin' around
that you and I do....

01:01:10.681 --> 01:01:13.100
-You know, when you're on, I--
-Excuse me.

01:01:13.684 --> 01:01:16.520
I really think you're a terrific performer.

01:01:17.188 --> 01:01:18.189
Fine.

01:01:18.522 --> 01:01:21.025
Hey, no, I'm serious.
You're really very good.

01:01:21.359 --> 01:01:22.360
I know.

01:01:23.402 --> 01:01:24.445
Groovy.

01:01:25.529 --> 01:01:29.116
In a little while I'm gonna have
the opportunity of openin' my own place.

01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:30.326
Much nicer.

01:01:31.035 --> 01:01:32.495
Much nicer than this.

01:01:33.537 --> 01:01:37.833
Uptown, sort of a nightclub restaurant
and everything.

01:01:40.378 --> 01:01:43.839
I was thinkin' you'd do much....
You'd do very nicely for the place.

01:01:43.881 --> 01:01:45.216
Dancin'?

01:01:46.050 --> 01:01:49.053
No, as the hostess. That's nice.

01:01:49.345 --> 01:01:50.221
Hostess?

01:01:50.554 --> 01:01:55.017
The people come in, you greet 'em
and you show 'em to the tables.

01:01:55.101 --> 01:01:59.230
Listen, why don't we get together later on?
We'll talk about it a little bit.

01:02:00.815 --> 01:02:04.026
-Chinese food?
-Hey, Chinese food.

01:02:07.572 --> 01:02:09.532
Where do you want me to drop you off?

01:02:09.907 --> 01:02:12.577
No, don't stop.
Just pass by real slow, okay?

01:02:18.916 --> 01:02:20.167
Hey, stop there.

01:02:20.293 --> 01:02:22.253
What, am I crazy?

01:02:23.629 --> 01:02:26.215
Would you take me back
to where you picked me up?

01:02:26.257 --> 01:02:28.217
-Sorry.
-All right.

01:02:40.104 --> 01:02:41.606
Hey, you crazy?

01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:45.526
That's all I need now:
to get caught in the village with a--

01:02:50.615 --> 01:02:51.824
Hi, Lou.

01:02:53.075 --> 01:02:55.578
-Come sta?
-Fine, thank you.

01:02:56.037 --> 01:02:57.538
-Good to see you.
-Good to see you.

01:02:57.622 --> 01:02:58.497
Here you go, Lou.

01:03:31.322 --> 01:03:33.074
-How are ya, kid?
-Nice to see you.

01:03:37.161 --> 01:03:38.663
-Giovanni, can I sit?
-Sure.

01:03:46.003 --> 01:03:47.171
Can I talk?

01:03:47.713 --> 01:03:48.589
What is it?

01:03:48.839 --> 01:03:50.132
It's about Groppi.

01:03:50.675 --> 01:03:53.344
I know all about it.
We'll discuss it later, huh?

01:03:53.678 --> 01:03:57.181
Sure, I understand.
Shall I serve the tripe now?

01:03:57.348 --> 01:03:59.725
-Anytime. Thank you, Oscar.
-You're welcome.

01:04:15.324 --> 01:04:16.784
They are not like us.

01:04:17.076 --> 01:04:19.370
They know where to come
when they need us.

01:04:19.579 --> 01:04:22.331
I realized this a long time ago,
during World War II.

01:04:22.873 --> 01:04:26.377
Charlie Lakey was working for
the government, taking care of the docks.

01:04:27.169 --> 01:04:28.337
What did he do?

01:04:29.213 --> 01:04:31.048
He was there, that's what he did.

01:04:33.217 --> 01:04:35.720
I said the same thing to your father
20 years ago.

01:04:37.054 --> 01:04:38.222
He didn't listen.

01:04:43.603 --> 01:04:45.896
You're still around that kid, Johnny Boy.

01:04:47.398 --> 01:04:49.525
This Johnny Boy is named after me.

01:04:49.609 --> 01:04:51.193
Nice, huh? Oh, sure.

01:04:52.153 --> 01:04:56.073
But this Johnny Boy is a little bit
like your friend, Groppi-- Half-crazy.

01:04:57.408 --> 01:05:01.037
I understand you try to help him out
because of our family and his family.

01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:02.914
Well, that's nice. I understand.

01:05:03.331 --> 01:05:05.917
But watch yourself, don't spoil anything.

01:05:06.250 --> 01:05:08.586
Honorable men go with honorable men.

01:05:11.255 --> 01:05:12.590
Don't forget that.

01:05:14.425 --> 01:05:16.344
His whole family has problems.

01:05:16.427 --> 01:05:19.972
His cousin, the girl who lives
next door to you....

01:05:20.139 --> 01:05:22.934
Teresa. The one who's sick in the head.

01:05:23.267 --> 01:05:25.436
No, she's got epilepsy.

01:05:25.770 --> 01:05:28.064
That's what I said. She's sick in the head.

01:05:28.773 --> 01:05:30.900
Her mother and father came to me
for advice.

01:05:31.442 --> 01:05:34.946
She wants her own apartment.
What am I gonna tell 'em? Lock her up?

01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:37.406
You know I'm compato with them.

01:05:38.115 --> 01:05:39.116
So I listen.

01:05:39.951 --> 01:05:41.744
I have to take an interest.

01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:44.247
You live next door. Keep an eye open.

01:05:44.288 --> 01:05:45.957
But don't get involved.

01:05:46.582 --> 01:05:49.961
Charlie, why don't you take a look
around the place if you want to?

01:05:50.962 --> 01:05:53.923
I've been in and outta this place
about 50 times already.

01:05:53.965 --> 01:05:56.217
Well, maybe you missed something.

01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:58.302
After all, you should get to know the place.

01:05:58.386 --> 01:05:59.387
Yeah.

01:06:12.108 --> 01:06:14.151
Jesus Christ, you are disgusting!

01:06:19.824 --> 01:06:21.867
Hi, Charlie, how are ya?
Hot enough for ya?

01:06:21.951 --> 01:06:23.828
Yeah, how are ya doin' there, Cookie?

01:06:43.514 --> 01:06:44.348
Fire.

01:06:57.820 --> 01:06:59.030
Teresa!

01:07:02.116 --> 01:07:03.117
Downstairs.

01:07:04.368 --> 01:07:06.954
Meet me downstairs now. Yeah.

01:07:12.335 --> 01:07:13.085
What is it?

01:07:17.715 --> 01:07:18.758
Come on.

01:07:30.019 --> 01:07:31.729
I can't make it tonight.

01:07:34.899 --> 01:07:37.735
All right, so, is that all?
So I'll see you on Friday?

01:07:38.236 --> 01:07:39.862
Friday...

01:07:40.071 --> 01:07:42.073
...I can't make it Friday either.

01:07:44.242 --> 01:07:45.368
What do you mean?

01:07:46.827 --> 01:07:48.579
I can't see you for a while.

01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:51.082
Don't tell me that.

01:07:51.165 --> 01:07:53.000
-Teresa.
-Why?

01:07:53.084 --> 01:07:55.711
Because you're fuckin' things up!
Between you and Johnny...

01:07:55.795 --> 01:07:58.047
-...you're gonna ruin everything for me.
-What?

01:07:58.256 --> 01:07:59.257
Ruin what...?

01:08:02.385 --> 01:08:04.887
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rucco, pardon me.
Come on inside.

01:08:06.472 --> 01:08:08.057
Why am I ruining everything?

01:08:08.099 --> 01:08:11.686
Because. Be quiet! I'll give you
a slap in the mouth, Teresa! Shut up!

01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:13.771
Listen to me for a minute.

01:08:14.605 --> 01:08:18.526
My uncle wants me to run a restaurant,
but I gotta stay away from you and Johnny.

01:08:18.609 --> 01:08:21.069
-Does he know about you and me?
-No.

01:08:21.153 --> 01:08:23.154
Does he know about Johnny
and those loans?

01:08:23.281 --> 01:08:26.117
No, what are ya kiddin' me?
Of course not.

01:08:27.285 --> 01:08:30.955
He doesn't understand, Johnny.
You know, he's just a kid who needs to be--

01:08:31.122 --> 01:08:32.122
Answer me!

01:08:32.290 --> 01:08:33.791
What do you want from me?

01:08:34.125 --> 01:08:36.919
I said: Do you feel the way
he does about me?

01:08:36.961 --> 01:08:37.837
No!

01:08:39.630 --> 01:08:42.425
I don't feel that way.
I don't want to stop seein' you.

01:08:42.466 --> 01:08:44.135
What are you afraid of?

01:08:45.970 --> 01:08:47.138
I love you.

01:08:48.305 --> 01:08:49.932
-Don't ever say that.
-What?

01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:52.475
-That.
-What? That you love me?

01:09:02.819 --> 01:09:04.613
Let's just get out of here.

01:09:10.493 --> 01:09:14.497
Let me get the restaurant first, all right?
Then I think things are gonna be easier.

01:09:14.582 --> 01:09:15.416
Okay.

01:09:45.529 --> 01:09:47.365
So, where have you been?

01:09:48.407 --> 01:09:49.242
Around.

01:09:50.326 --> 01:09:52.370
You heard what happened to Groppi, huh?

01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:54.413
Groppi? No, what?

01:09:54.872 --> 01:09:57.917
Well, Oscar found out where his partner is.

01:09:58.668 --> 01:10:00.878
It seems Groppi went to visit his mother.

01:10:01.087 --> 01:10:03.839
He went to her room
where she was watching television...

01:10:04.048 --> 01:10:06.217
...and he says to her that he's sorry.

01:10:06.634 --> 01:10:09.053
That's all. Just, he's sorry.

01:10:10.054 --> 01:10:13.224
He goes into the next room, gets a gun,
puts it in his mouth....

01:10:13.391 --> 01:10:14.392
That's it!

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:20.022
How do you like that? I tell you
that Groppi was always half-crazy...

01:10:20.231 --> 01:10:22.233
...half-crazy to say the least.

01:10:27.238 --> 01:10:28.364
What is it?

01:10:29.407 --> 01:10:30.533
Not now, huh?

01:10:31.075 --> 01:10:33.077
Doesn't he see that we are talking?

01:10:33.411 --> 01:10:35.162
A couple of minutes, will ya? Outside.

01:10:39.625 --> 01:10:40.585
What does he want?

01:10:40.668 --> 01:10:42.712
He wants to talk to me about somethin'.

01:10:43.838 --> 01:10:45.172
Hey, you spit on my shoe.

01:10:48.342 --> 01:10:51.053
Okay, Charlie, lot of aggravation though,
you know.

01:10:51.721 --> 01:10:53.055
Like Johnny Boy...

01:10:53.264 --> 01:10:54.890
...I figure...

01:10:55.182 --> 01:10:57.518
...I give him all the breaks I can give him.

01:10:57.768 --> 01:10:58.936
-Oh, look, Michael....
-No.

01:10:59.395 --> 01:11:02.898
No, Charlie, it's no good, see?
He's a punk bastard, Charlie.

01:11:03.608 --> 01:11:06.235
I call them down there at work
and I ask them...

01:11:06.277 --> 01:11:09.113
...if Johnny Boy's there.
He doesn't even show up anymore.

01:11:09.488 --> 01:11:11.449
-They told ya that down at his place?
-Yeah.

01:11:11.782 --> 01:11:13.534
How's he gonna pay me, Charlie?

01:11:13.618 --> 01:11:16.120
I've talked to him, I've talked to him.

01:11:19.332 --> 01:11:21.792
-What more can I do?
-I don't know.

01:11:24.128 --> 01:11:26.756
Tonight at the party,
the three of us get together...

01:11:26.797 --> 01:11:29.508
...and we knock some sense into his head.
Okay?

01:11:29.634 --> 01:11:34.138
All right, Charlie. You know I don't like
bein' taken advantage of.

01:11:34.805 --> 01:11:37.516
I mean, you're inside there
with your uncle and all that.

01:11:37.808 --> 01:11:39.685
It's kind of embarrassing to me, you know?

01:11:39.769 --> 01:11:41.896
I apologize, Michael.
We had some business.

01:11:41.979 --> 01:11:43.314
Private. Ya know what I mean?

01:11:44.857 --> 01:11:46.025
I'm late. I gotta meet someone.

01:11:46.108 --> 01:11:47.944
All right. We'll settle it tonight.

01:11:48.027 --> 01:11:49.403
-Okay.
-Ciao.

01:11:49.487 --> 01:11:52.114
And, Michael, I appreciate
what you're doin' for me.

01:11:52.156 --> 01:11:53.658
All right.

01:13:02.059 --> 01:13:03.894
-Very intelligent, too, you know?
-Yeah.

01:13:04.103 --> 01:13:06.230
She's goin' to college.
She's gonna be a school teacher.

01:13:09.317 --> 01:13:11.110
I've been out with her a few times.

01:13:11.193 --> 01:13:12.862
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

01:13:13.905 --> 01:13:16.741
-Let me see that picture.
-Yeah, she's gonna be a teacher.

01:13:17.909 --> 01:13:20.745
-Oh, I know this girl.
-Yeah?

01:13:21.746 --> 01:13:24.248
I seen her kissin' a nigger
under the bridge in Jersey.

01:13:24.415 --> 01:13:26.417
What are you talkin' about?

01:13:26.709 --> 01:13:29.420
A nigger, that's a--
A black, a nigger.

01:13:29.879 --> 01:13:31.255
What do ya mean, kissin'?

01:13:32.423 --> 01:13:36.427
I mean kissing. Her lips on his lips.
Kissing.

01:13:36.844 --> 01:13:38.554
-You sure?
-I'm sure.

01:13:43.100 --> 01:13:45.269
I kissed her.

01:13:45.770 --> 01:13:47.104
Don't worry about it, brother.

01:14:08.125 --> 01:14:12.755
Hallelujah, I've come to create order.
Carl, J& B and soda, please.

01:14:13.130 --> 01:14:15.299
God be with you and with his spirit.

01:14:21.305 --> 01:14:22.598
-Let me ask you somethin'.
-What?

01:14:22.723 --> 01:14:24.267
Art thou the king of the Jews?

01:14:25.476 --> 01:14:28.479
Does thou say this of thyself
or have others told thee of me?

01:14:28.896 --> 01:14:29.981
Am I a Jew?

01:14:30.481 --> 01:14:31.983
My kingdom's not of this world.

01:14:32.066 --> 01:14:35.570
Jerry, hey, how ya doin'?

01:14:41.993 --> 01:14:43.327
To Jerry...

01:14:44.996 --> 01:14:46.831
...who served in Vietnam.

01:14:47.164 --> 01:14:48.958
The immortal words of John Garfield:

01:14:49.041 --> 01:14:51.502
''Get him in the eyes,
get him right in the eyes.''

01:14:52.169 --> 01:14:54.797
Came back with a silver star.
From the boys.

01:14:57.383 --> 01:14:58.968
Drinks for everybody!

01:15:06.517 --> 01:15:08.185
Hey, drinks for everybody!

01:15:11.522 --> 01:15:13.691
Could make a shirt outta that, Jerry.

01:15:22.033 --> 01:15:24.535
-We drink and then we bullshit!
-We bullshit!

01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:29.874
George, my man.

01:15:29.957 --> 01:15:30.958
Watch this.

01:15:32.501 --> 01:15:33.711
Put your mouth down there.

01:16:01.948 --> 01:16:02.865
-Michael.
-What?

01:16:03.032 --> 01:16:04.700
Play only old ones tonight.

01:16:07.036 --> 01:16:08.246
Only old ones.

01:16:51.455 --> 01:16:53.291
''Did you ever hear of a wish sandwich?

01:16:53.374 --> 01:16:55.418
''It's the kind
that you're supposed to take...

01:16:55.501 --> 01:16:57.837
''...two pieces of bread
and wish you had some meat.

01:17:16.105 --> 01:17:18.149
''The other day I ate a ricochet biscuit.

01:17:18.441 --> 01:17:22.153
''It's the kind that's supposed
to bounce off the wall back in your mouth.

01:17:22.486 --> 01:17:25.364
''If it don't bounce back, you go hungry!''

01:17:47.678 --> 01:17:49.347
Charlie, Flash ain't here yet.

01:17:51.682 --> 01:17:52.975
He said he'd be here.

01:17:53.142 --> 01:17:56.228
Well, he isn't. Nice, real nice.

01:18:00.441 --> 01:18:01.692
He'll be here.

01:18:05.947 --> 01:18:07.156
Look...

01:18:07.949 --> 01:18:10.034
...I'll give ya $20 to hold ya for now.

01:18:10.201 --> 01:18:14.205
What, are ya kidding? Twenty dollars
doesn't pay the interest for two hours.

01:18:15.206 --> 01:18:18.834
-Now with this week, it's almost $3,000.
-Three thousand?

01:18:20.086 --> 01:18:23.214
Shit, you charge a guy
from the neighborhood 1800 vig?

01:18:25.049 --> 01:18:26.842
One day he's late with his payments.

01:18:26.884 --> 01:18:28.052
What am I, his father?

01:18:28.552 --> 01:18:31.180
Ya could have come to me
a little sooner, friend.

01:18:31.264 --> 01:18:33.057
Charlie, this is business.

01:18:33.391 --> 01:18:34.517
Be realistic.

01:18:34.558 --> 01:18:37.061
Where's he gonna come up
with $3,000, huh?

01:18:38.062 --> 01:18:39.397
Let's work somethin' out.

01:18:41.565 --> 01:18:42.900
Make it $1,800.

01:18:43.150 --> 01:18:44.235
Don't hustle me.

01:18:44.443 --> 01:18:45.736
I'm not hustlin' you.

01:18:51.409 --> 01:18:53.077
Let's make it $2,000.

01:18:56.581 --> 01:18:58.874
All right, now you're bein' sensible about it.

01:18:58.916 --> 01:19:01.419
I swear to Jesus Christ
and the goddamn cross.

01:19:01.711 --> 01:19:04.880
If he thinks he's makin' a jerk off outta me,
I'll break his legs.

01:19:04.964 --> 01:19:07.049
Michael, come on, huh?

01:19:08.009 --> 01:19:10.052
You should be smart enough
not to get involved.

01:19:10.094 --> 01:19:11.721
Don't tell me what to do, huh?

01:19:11.762 --> 01:19:12.888
I'm tellin' you the truth.

01:19:12.930 --> 01:19:15.433
The fuckin' truth is
you're more involved than anyone.

01:19:15.474 --> 01:19:17.268
What do I look like, a jerk?

01:19:18.769 --> 01:19:20.813
On next payday
I'm comin' down here to Tony's.

01:19:21.355 --> 01:19:23.816
Johnny Boy better show
or I'm gonna find him and...

01:19:23.899 --> 01:19:25.568
...I'm gonna break his fuckin' legs.

01:19:26.277 --> 01:19:27.904
We understand each other?

01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:30.281
I heard ya.

01:19:33.367 --> 01:19:35.578
Good.

01:19:37.288 --> 01:19:38.956
Amen, I say to thee.

01:19:40.291 --> 01:19:43.794
Thou will not come out from it
till thou hast paid the last penny.

01:19:47.131 --> 01:19:48.633
Michael, you look tired.

01:19:48.799 --> 01:19:50.134
You said it.

01:20:17.536 --> 01:20:20.331
Jerry, take it easy!
We're in America, Jerry!

01:21:01.664 --> 01:21:02.623
Dance?

01:21:27.565 --> 01:21:28.816
Do you like this song?

01:22:04.769 --> 01:22:06.520
Charlie, there's a girl here to see you.

01:22:11.609 --> 01:22:14.362
-Charlie?
-What is it? What's wrong?

01:22:14.987 --> 01:22:17.406
Johnny Boy is up on that building
on the corner.

01:22:17.448 --> 01:22:19.450
He's been on the roof for half an hour.

01:22:19.492 --> 01:22:21.827
-All right, don't get excited.
-He's got a gun.

01:22:22.203 --> 01:22:23.329
Don't get excited.

01:22:24.455 --> 01:22:26.332
-You stay here.
-I'm coming with you.

01:22:26.499 --> 01:22:28.167
-Teresa, stay here.
-I don't want to--

01:22:28.251 --> 01:22:29.752
You stay here. Tony....

01:22:29.835 --> 01:22:31.295
Hey, Teresa, stay here.

01:22:32.213 --> 01:22:34.298
-Come on, have a drink.
-I don't want a drink.

01:22:34.382 --> 01:22:36.217
-Carl, give her a drink.
-I don't want one!

01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:37.260
Have a drink.

01:22:37.551 --> 01:22:39.595
-I'll have a seven and seven.
-Okay.

01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:44.684
Charlie. Hey, watch out.

01:22:45.184 --> 01:22:46.435
Crazy bastard's on the roof.

01:22:50.898 --> 01:22:53.484
Johnny! It's me, Charlie!

01:22:53.609 --> 01:22:54.402
Hey, watch this!

01:22:54.485 --> 01:22:56.696
I'll shoot the light out
in the Empire State Building.

01:22:57.029 --> 01:22:59.031
Hey, cut it out, stupid. It's me.

01:23:10.084 --> 01:23:11.544
Hey, what do ya got up there?

01:23:11.752 --> 01:23:13.087
A .38!

01:23:13.421 --> 01:23:15.464
-That ain't real, is it?
-Yeah.

01:23:16.757 --> 01:23:19.385
What's wrong with him?
I'll throw that fucker off the roof.

01:23:25.683 --> 01:23:30.438
Oh, shit. Hey, lady, I'm sorry.
Lady, I didn't mean it, I swear to God!

01:23:30.688 --> 01:23:31.689
I'm very sorry.

01:23:32.898 --> 01:23:34.859
Are you crazy? What are you doin'?

01:23:35.026 --> 01:23:36.235
I scared the shit out of 'em!

01:23:36.903 --> 01:23:38.237
Very funny. Give me that.

01:23:38.571 --> 01:23:41.115
I hit that lady.
I tried to get her clothesline.

01:23:41.699 --> 01:23:42.575
What's wrong with you?

01:23:42.658 --> 01:23:43.618
What do ya mean?

01:23:43.951 --> 01:23:45.620
You have Teresa half-crazy about this.

01:23:45.953 --> 01:23:48.372
Why? I wasn't shootin' at nobody.
Just up in the air.

01:23:48.414 --> 01:23:50.625
I want to wake up the neighborhood.
It's dead.

01:23:51.125 --> 01:23:54.253
I hate that woman
with a vengeance, a passion.

01:23:56.756 --> 01:23:58.299
You and your numbers!

01:23:58.424 --> 01:23:59.759
Fuckin' chicken shits!

01:24:01.510 --> 01:24:02.595
Back to Bataan.

01:24:04.889 --> 01:24:06.807
Now they're gonna get
a real back to Bataan.

01:24:07.433 --> 01:24:09.727
An atom bomb,
wake up the neighborhood.

01:24:09.977 --> 01:24:12.229
-What the fuck? Put that out!
-Put what out?

01:24:12.313 --> 01:24:14.982
-Johnny, put that out!
-Surprise, you want to see?

01:24:15.191 --> 01:24:17.652
-Want to see?
-Johnny, put that--

01:24:36.837 --> 01:24:38.464
Let's hide in here for a while.

01:24:40.091 --> 01:24:41.634
What's wrong with the door?

01:24:41.717 --> 01:24:44.637
-What are you kickin', stupid? Get in there.
-About time.

01:24:48.182 --> 01:24:49.934
Remember when we played hide-and-seek?

01:24:50.017 --> 01:24:52.687
Never mind that.
What's this crap about last week?

01:24:53.521 --> 01:24:54.355
What?

01:24:55.523 --> 01:24:58.109
You got some balls not showin' up
for work last week.

01:24:58.192 --> 01:25:00.820
After all we had to do
to get you on that truck, stupid!

01:25:00.903 --> 01:25:02.280
What's the matter with you?

01:25:02.363 --> 01:25:04.574
Charlie, come on, man.
My arm was hurtin'--

01:25:04.657 --> 01:25:07.535
Your hand was hurtin'.
Your mouth's gonna hurt from this kick!

01:25:07.618 --> 01:25:10.580
For what? Hey, I swear to you,
what are you talkin' about?

01:25:11.038 --> 01:25:13.040
Besides, I don't like loadin' crates.

01:25:13.124 --> 01:25:15.543
You're not supposed to like it.

01:25:16.460 --> 01:25:17.712
What gets me is your attitude.

01:25:17.795 --> 01:25:20.089
My attitude?
What gets me is your attitude.

01:25:20.631 --> 01:25:24.010
-Did you ever load crates? You don't work.
-My attitude....

01:25:24.635 --> 01:25:27.221
You tell me to go to work
and then you do all the talkin'.

01:25:27.305 --> 01:25:28.472
What do you do? You do nothin'.

01:25:28.556 --> 01:25:32.184
I'll tell ya somethin' I don't do:
I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams, stupid!

01:25:35.646 --> 01:25:38.524
I got Michael to make it $2,000,
give ya a break on that.

01:25:38.608 --> 01:25:39.567
Oh, yeah?

01:25:40.234 --> 01:25:42.737
Go to work tomorrow
or I'll break both your arms.

01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:44.488
-We understand each other?
-Yeah.

01:25:44.614 --> 01:25:46.449
I'm sorry. I really am. I mean...

01:25:47.617 --> 01:25:51.162
...'cause I appreciate everything
you're doin' for me. I mean, I do.

01:25:53.331 --> 01:25:56.667
So I was figurin' that the next
logical thing to do-- Don't get mad!

01:25:56.792 --> 01:25:57.960
-How?
-How you get.

01:25:58.336 --> 01:26:00.129
-You know a way out of this?
-Yeah.

01:26:00.212 --> 01:26:01.756
Well, let me hear this one.

01:26:02.590 --> 01:26:03.758
Talk to your uncle.

01:26:05.801 --> 01:26:09.096
Oh, that'd be just really great for you,
wouldn't it, huh?

01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:10.932
But not for me!

01:26:11.390 --> 01:26:15.061
Johnny, one more word out of your mouth,
my uncle hears one word about this--

01:26:17.146 --> 01:26:18.397
All right.

01:26:18.981 --> 01:26:20.566
I was just askin', that's all.

01:26:21.567 --> 01:26:23.736
That's what I get for gettin' involved.

01:26:24.487 --> 01:26:25.446
Look...

01:26:26.030 --> 01:26:29.700
...on payday, at least show up
at Tony's place to meet him, okay?

01:26:29.784 --> 01:26:32.870
This way he won't think
you're tryin' to make a jerk off out of him.

01:26:32.954 --> 01:26:36.123
-Yeah, all right.
-I'm not askin' ya, I'm tellin' ya!

01:27:31.137 --> 01:27:32.722
-Johnny, come on.
-What?

01:27:33.014 --> 01:27:34.098
Come on.

01:27:34.348 --> 01:27:35.683
What, we are goin' now?

01:27:58.372 --> 01:28:01.208
-Hey, Shorty!
-Fuck you, Charlie, will you?

01:28:02.001 --> 01:28:04.503
Shorty, you must be havin'
illusions of grandeur.

01:28:04.587 --> 01:28:06.672
-What do ya want from me?
-Talk to him.

01:28:07.173 --> 01:28:09.800
Gonna see you and Johnny Boy
down here tonight, right?

01:28:09.884 --> 01:28:11.218
Yeah, we'll be here.

01:28:11.385 --> 01:28:14.931
I'm tellin' ya, Charlie, that kid doesn't
show up tonight, I'll find him.

01:28:15.014 --> 01:28:16.724
I'm gonna drag him down here.

01:28:17.308 --> 01:28:19.727
I'll tie one of his legs
to that Cadillac bumper.

01:28:19.810 --> 01:28:22.355
I'll tie the other to the Ford. And, boom!

01:28:24.649 --> 01:28:25.691
We'll be here!

01:28:25.983 --> 01:28:27.360
Better be here, Charlie.

01:28:27.735 --> 01:28:29.862
Michael, don't you fuckin' threaten me.

01:28:34.533 --> 01:28:37.203
Miss? Excuse me, Miss?

01:28:38.079 --> 01:28:39.413
What do you want?

01:28:39.538 --> 01:28:43.000
I just want you to remind your cousin
he's gotta see Michael tonight.

01:28:43.084 --> 01:28:44.252
Then tell him yourself.

01:28:44.335 --> 01:28:45.962
I'd love to. Where is he?

01:28:46.003 --> 01:28:47.296
I don't know. He's not here.

01:28:47.380 --> 01:28:48.673
He's here all the time.

01:28:48.756 --> 01:28:50.466
-Fuck you!
-Fuck me?

01:28:51.342 --> 01:28:53.427
Why am I taking this from you?

01:28:54.011 --> 01:28:55.763
Look what you did--

01:28:58.099 --> 01:29:00.017
Here.

01:29:01.852 --> 01:29:02.770
What am I doin'?

01:29:02.853 --> 01:29:05.648
Would you just give me
my fuckin' eggplant, please?

01:29:09.860 --> 01:29:11.320
You got some mouth, you know that?

01:29:11.362 --> 01:29:12.655
Get outta here!

01:29:16.909 --> 01:29:20.288
Now just be sure and tell him
to be here tonight, all right?

01:30:00.286 --> 01:30:02.538
You sure he didn't say anything
about tonight?

01:30:02.622 --> 01:30:04.290
I told you before, nothing.

01:30:05.541 --> 01:30:09.629
Charlie, will you listen to me?
I can't stay here too long this time of night.

01:30:09.712 --> 01:30:12.548
Now, Michael was looking for him.

01:30:13.424 --> 01:30:15.176
-What's happening?
-Nothin'.

01:30:17.094 --> 01:30:19.096
I don't believe you.

01:30:21.390 --> 01:30:22.433
Son of a bitch.

01:30:22.516 --> 01:30:25.269
What? What did you just say?

01:30:25.353 --> 01:30:27.021
Teresa, watch the hands already!

01:31:10.439 --> 01:31:12.400
Charlie, what do you think?

01:31:14.860 --> 01:31:17.363
Well, don't you realize
what this apartment means?

01:31:20.241 --> 01:31:22.785
Maybe after a while
you could even move in yourself.

01:31:22.868 --> 01:31:26.038
Enough with that apartment already!
I don't want to hear anymore!

01:31:26.664 --> 01:31:28.749
I got enough on me
with your bastard cousin.

01:31:28.833 --> 01:31:31.752
You want to move, go on.
But leave me out of it!

01:33:00.132 --> 01:33:04.011
Teresa, I didn't mean that,
but we've got a situation right now.

01:33:04.178 --> 01:33:05.638
-Yeah, a situation.
-Come on.

01:33:05.972 --> 01:33:09.350
Look, go and play your fuckin' games
with that dunkhead. I don't care.

01:33:10.518 --> 01:33:11.852
Teresa, it's no game.

01:33:21.946 --> 01:33:25.032
-Hey, hello.
-Where were you?

01:33:25.116 --> 01:33:26.576
Where was I? I was around.

01:33:26.659 --> 01:33:29.620
Answer me, you son of a bitch!
Where were you? Shut up!

01:33:29.704 --> 01:33:33.082
Shut up, Teresa. We don't want
to get Charlie in trouble here, do we?

01:33:33.165 --> 01:33:35.668
Don't be cute. I've been goin' crazy here!

01:33:37.003 --> 01:33:38.296
What's the matter with you?

01:33:40.172 --> 01:33:41.799
You're about an hour and a half late!

01:33:41.882 --> 01:33:43.384
Oh, that's too bad.

01:33:44.719 --> 01:33:47.346
Michael's waitin' for us.
You forget or what?

01:33:49.432 --> 01:33:52.018
Your cousin was gettin' sick
worryin' about you.

01:33:52.101 --> 01:33:54.186
We'd have started callin' up everybody!

01:33:55.688 --> 01:33:58.691
Yeah? That's too bad. Isn't that too bad?

01:33:59.650 --> 01:34:01.777
Huh, Teresa?

01:34:01.861 --> 01:34:04.530
So, kiddies,
yas make any plans yet, or what?

01:34:04.614 --> 01:34:05.948
When are yas gettin' married?

01:34:06.032 --> 01:34:07.617
-Gonna get engaged?
-Don't get smart.

01:34:07.658 --> 01:34:09.660
What do ya mean?
I'm stupid, remember?

01:34:09.702 --> 01:34:11.245
-You heard me.
-I'm a stronzo.

01:34:11.370 --> 01:34:13.748
I'm so stupid
you gotta look out for me, right?

01:34:17.251 --> 01:34:19.378
What's the matter? Hey, Teresa.

01:34:20.254 --> 01:34:22.590
She's upset.
Now what are you so upset about?

01:34:23.090 --> 01:34:24.467
You don't understand Charlie.

01:34:24.550 --> 01:34:27.386
Charlie likes everybody,
everybody likes Charlie.

01:34:27.511 --> 01:34:29.722
-Enough!
-Fuckin' politician over here.

01:34:29.805 --> 01:34:31.641
-Watch your mouth!
-I'm goin' home.

01:34:31.682 --> 01:34:34.018
Hey, no. Wait Teresa!
Teresa, whoa!

01:34:34.101 --> 01:34:35.937
Hold it. Teresa, come on, stay here.

01:34:36.020 --> 01:34:39.357
I don't wanna break up
a nice, happy household here.

01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:41.776
-No, I'll be honest--
-Stop foolin' around.

01:34:41.859 --> 01:34:44.570
I swear to God,
if you open your mouth about any of this--

01:34:44.654 --> 01:34:45.821
About what?

01:34:46.197 --> 01:34:47.698
You know what I'm talkin' about.

01:34:47.782 --> 01:34:49.158
About what? You two?

01:34:49.242 --> 01:34:52.912
Who cares? I won't even say nothin'
to my aunt and uncle.

01:34:52.995 --> 01:34:54.872
The guys don't give a shit.
What do they care?

01:34:54.956 --> 01:34:57.458
I won't even say nothin'
to your uncle, Giovanni.

01:35:05.549 --> 01:35:07.593
I wanted to ask you somethin', Charlie.

01:35:07.802 --> 01:35:11.097
I always wondered about her.
This is the God's honest truth.

01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:14.517
I always wondered about what happens
when she comes. She get a fit?

01:35:15.393 --> 01:35:17.395
What happens when she comes, I mean--

01:35:18.896 --> 01:35:22.024
You dirty, fuckin' bastard!
Don't ever hit me again!

01:35:25.778 --> 01:35:26.821
I'll tell your uncle!

01:35:26.904 --> 01:35:30.408
-Go ahead. Go on, right now!
-Don't do it!

01:35:30.616 --> 01:35:32.910
I'll tear your fuckin' eyes outta your head!

01:35:33.077 --> 01:35:36.122
-I'm gonna kill you, bastard!
-Go on!

01:35:39.584 --> 01:35:41.961
Teresa! What did you do?
You know about this?

01:35:45.131 --> 01:35:47.466
Hey, how should I know?
She's your fuckin' girl.

01:35:52.555 --> 01:35:54.557
Teresa?

01:35:55.266 --> 01:35:57.393
Hey, you! Come here, get out!

01:35:58.978 --> 01:36:00.563
Do you know what to do?

01:36:03.316 --> 01:36:05.735
I don't know. She had an attack.

01:36:29.884 --> 01:36:33.804
What do you mean what you did for me?
You didn't do nothin' for me, you fuck!

01:36:33.888 --> 01:36:36.098
Fuckin' bastard, you're a fuckin' bastard!

01:36:36.307 --> 01:36:38.017
-Come on.
-You're a fuckin' bastard!

01:36:38.100 --> 01:36:39.685
Come on, what are you doin'?

01:36:40.019 --> 01:36:41.520
What are you doin' for me?

01:36:42.355 --> 01:36:45.024
Don't show up tonight.
We'll see what happens to you.

01:36:50.529 --> 01:36:52.698
How much money you got
for Michael tonight?

01:36:53.866 --> 01:36:54.867
I got nothin'.

01:36:55.201 --> 01:36:56.369
You got anything?

01:36:56.494 --> 01:36:58.371
I got eight fuckin' dollars on me.

01:37:02.083 --> 01:37:06.712
Well then, here. Take $20.
Take $22. At your rate that'll...

01:37:06.837 --> 01:37:10.091
...make $30 we'll give to Michael.
I'll keep $11 for the weekend.

01:37:11.008 --> 01:37:12.927
Maybe we'll get some chinks later.

01:37:14.053 --> 01:37:16.430
Take it stupid, I'm doin' it for you!
Come on.

01:37:17.890 --> 01:37:20.059
Carryin' on, huh? Cut it out, will ya?

01:37:20.184 --> 01:37:22.645
Come on, Charlie.
$30 ain't nothin', you know that.

01:37:22.728 --> 01:37:25.481
The only way you're gonna do is
if you talk to your uncle.

01:37:25.523 --> 01:37:26.649
-That's it.
-Get away.

01:37:26.732 --> 01:37:29.402
-Why not?
-I ain't gonna do it. Forget about that.

01:37:30.528 --> 01:37:31.737
Did I hurt you?

01:37:45.126 --> 01:37:49.088
You're over an hour late.
Michael said he'd be back though.

01:37:54.010 --> 01:37:56.012
-Have a drink.
-I don't want any.

01:38:01.767 --> 01:38:03.269
Hey, cut it out, will ya?

01:38:08.482 --> 01:38:10.484
-Where are ya goin'?
-To the bathroom.

01:38:11.652 --> 01:38:14.155
All right, now.
Take it easy, don't get excited.

01:38:16.908 --> 01:38:17.909
No!

01:38:22.955 --> 01:38:24.290
Who's the girl?

01:38:24.624 --> 01:38:25.458
Jewish.

01:38:25.791 --> 01:38:27.543
-How do you know?
-Look at her.

01:38:28.961 --> 01:38:30.212
She don't look Jewish.

01:38:30.296 --> 01:38:33.799
She's in here every night with
a different guy. You know how they are.

01:38:39.472 --> 01:38:40.806
I love you.

01:38:42.516 --> 01:38:46.354
Ever since that first day when I saw you
playing volleyball with the nuns....

01:38:47.021 --> 01:38:48.356
I couldn't help myself.

01:38:50.691 --> 01:38:52.360
-Let's go.
-Fuck off.

01:38:52.485 --> 01:38:54.654
-Let's go.
-You go. I'm staying.

01:38:55.655 --> 01:38:59.033
It's obvious the girl doesn't want
to go with you. What do you think?

01:38:59.116 --> 01:39:00.660
Look, fella, this is private.

01:39:00.826 --> 01:39:01.994
Nothin' is private.

01:39:02.328 --> 01:39:03.829
I want to go.

01:39:04.664 --> 01:39:06.916
If she wants to go or not, she's not.
How's that?

01:39:06.999 --> 01:39:08.251
Let go of her.

01:39:08.334 --> 01:39:10.044
-Take her away.
-You're hurting me!

01:39:10.127 --> 01:39:12.505
Physically, you take her away from me.
Go ahead.

01:39:14.340 --> 01:39:15.633
You bastard!

01:39:16.634 --> 01:39:17.885
Hey, Joyce?

01:39:26.060 --> 01:39:28.020
Maybe we'll meet at bingo some night.

01:39:40.783 --> 01:39:41.826
Hey, Mike!

01:39:44.954 --> 01:39:46.539
What's the story, John?

01:39:47.873 --> 01:39:51.419
I was here earlier tonight.
You kept me waiting for an hour.

01:39:51.836 --> 01:39:53.838
Hey, I'm sorry, Mikey, but you know...

01:39:53.921 --> 01:39:55.423
...I had somethin' to do.

01:39:55.506 --> 01:39:57.008
But I got somethin' for ya.

01:39:57.091 --> 01:39:59.093
Not much, but I got somethin' for ya.

01:40:01.137 --> 01:40:04.557
He has about $30.
That's all he's got on him, Michael.

01:40:07.393 --> 01:40:09.604
-Where's the rest?
-Yeah, where's the rest?

01:40:10.354 --> 01:40:12.648
I bought a few rounds of drinks
while I was waitin'.

01:40:12.690 --> 01:40:13.983
You know what I mean?

01:40:15.693 --> 01:40:17.904
Tony says my credit ain't no good no more.

01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:25.286
You know $30 is enough of an insult.

01:40:26.787 --> 01:40:28.706
But I'd take it for Charlie here.

01:40:30.875 --> 01:40:32.001
John...

01:40:33.085 --> 01:40:34.086
...$10!

01:40:48.267 --> 01:40:50.019
You're really somethin', you know that?

01:40:50.061 --> 01:40:52.772
You too good for this $10, huh?

01:40:52.855 --> 01:40:54.106
It's a good $10.

01:40:55.733 --> 01:40:57.151
You know somethin', Mikey?

01:40:57.735 --> 01:40:59.487
You make me laugh, you know that?

01:40:59.987 --> 01:41:01.989
I borrow money
all over this neighborhood...

01:41:02.073 --> 01:41:05.076
...left and right, from everybody,
and I never paid 'em back.

01:41:05.117 --> 01:41:07.954
So I can't borrow no money
from nobody no more, right?

01:41:08.287 --> 01:41:10.957
Who does that leave me
to borrow money from but you?

01:41:11.249 --> 01:41:14.418
I borrow money from you
because you're the only jerk off around...

01:41:14.502 --> 01:41:17.672
...that I could borrow money from
without payin' back, right?

01:41:18.839 --> 01:41:20.132
'Cause that's what you are...

01:41:20.216 --> 01:41:22.468
...that's what I think of you, a jerk off.

01:41:23.469 --> 01:41:26.639
He's smilin' because you're a jerk off.
You're a fuckin' jerk off.

01:41:29.767 --> 01:41:31.519
And I'll tell you somethin' else.

01:41:32.353 --> 01:41:34.605
Mikey, I fucked you right
where you breathe...

01:41:34.689 --> 01:41:37.692
...'cause I don't give two shits
about you or nobody else.

01:41:41.821 --> 01:41:43.072
Easy!

01:41:46.492 --> 01:41:48.578
Come on, fuck-face!

01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:53.624
I got somethin' for ya, motherfucker!
Come on.

01:41:56.335 --> 01:41:57.420
I'm a big shot.

01:42:00.172 --> 01:42:02.425
Come on, D.D., disappointed dunce sky.

01:42:03.092 --> 01:42:05.428
Right, asshole! Come on.

01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:07.430
You don't have--

01:42:07.471 --> 01:42:10.516
-You don't have the guts to use it.
-I don't, huh?

01:42:10.725 --> 01:42:13.436
I don't have the guts.
Come on, asshole. Come over here.

01:42:13.519 --> 01:42:15.062
I'll put this up your ass!

01:42:20.192 --> 01:42:22.695
Hey, asshole, this is for you asshole.

01:42:23.070 --> 01:42:24.322
Fuckin' asshole.

01:42:26.073 --> 01:42:28.534
You stupid bastard,
were you gonna use that?

01:42:28.993 --> 01:42:30.202
Were you gonna use that?

01:42:30.286 --> 01:42:32.747
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
I'll fuckin' kill you, Johnny.

01:42:37.335 --> 01:42:38.920
Big fuckin' man.

01:42:48.888 --> 01:42:50.056
All right.

01:42:51.933 --> 01:42:53.434
So, now you did it.

01:42:57.396 --> 01:42:58.773
No bullets in this.

01:43:01.192 --> 01:43:02.485
Now ya did it!

01:43:02.985 --> 01:43:05.071
Get him outta here before this blows up.

01:43:05.154 --> 01:43:06.989
Hide the gun, Tony. Throw it away.

01:43:09.158 --> 01:43:11.702
Listen, Tony, I gotta borrow your car.
We oughta...

01:43:11.911 --> 01:43:14.330
...take a ride.
We shouldn't be around here now.

01:43:19.043 --> 01:43:21.128
Don't go driving around.
Go to a movie or somethin'.

01:43:21.212 --> 01:43:23.839
This is no good, all right.
You know what I mean?

01:43:25.174 --> 01:43:27.134
-You understand?
-Maybe.

01:43:32.556 --> 01:43:34.141
You got what you wanted.

01:44:16.642 --> 01:44:18.185
Get in the car, John!

01:44:52.303 --> 01:44:53.471
Murderer!

01:44:54.889 --> 01:44:55.890
Murderer!

01:45:13.115 --> 01:45:14.617
Teresa, you all right?

01:45:14.784 --> 01:45:15.826
Yeah.

01:45:16.744 --> 01:45:17.745
I'm sorry.

01:45:19.789 --> 01:45:21.123
I told ya I'm sorry.

01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:24.710
He's in trouble.

01:45:24.794 --> 01:45:26.504
What do you mean? What's going on?

01:45:26.587 --> 01:45:28.589
Look, Teresa, just trouble, all right?

01:45:28.673 --> 01:45:32.009
We gotta leave for a few days,
till I get a chance to talk to some people.

01:45:32.093 --> 01:45:34.512
I need a couple of bucks
to get to Greenwood Lake.

01:45:34.595 --> 01:45:36.472
-Where are you goin'?
-To Greenwood Lake.

01:45:36.514 --> 01:45:38.474
-I'm coming with you.
-No, you're not.

01:45:39.100 --> 01:45:41.352
Do you want more trouble?
I'm comin' with you.

01:45:41.435 --> 01:45:43.271
Teresa, I got no time for this.

01:45:43.604 --> 01:45:45.815
-So, what happened?
-Forget it.

01:45:46.482 --> 01:45:49.735
I really think we should talk to your uncle.
That's the only way.

01:45:49.819 --> 01:45:50.820
No!

01:45:51.821 --> 01:45:54.740
-What happened?
-It's all right, Teresa. Will you forget it?

01:45:54.824 --> 01:45:56.993
What are you gonna do, hide me or what?

01:45:57.159 --> 01:45:58.286
That's right.

01:46:03.624 --> 01:46:07.128
I guess you could safely say
that things haven't gone so well tonight.

01:46:08.129 --> 01:46:10.298
But I'm tryin', Lord. I'm tryin'.

01:46:13.634 --> 01:46:15.303
What are you, talkin' to yourself?

01:46:30.401 --> 01:46:32.028
Louder, louder!

01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:34.530
Go right ahead. Turn on the radio, John!

01:46:35.197 --> 01:46:37.158
We're goin' to a party.
How about some fun?

01:46:37.241 --> 01:46:38.993
Where are you goin'? To Brooklyn?

01:46:39.076 --> 01:46:41.037
Why don't ya make it louder? Go ahead!

01:46:41.078 --> 01:46:43.331
-Where are we goin'?
-Seriously, do you know?

01:46:43.414 --> 01:46:46.208
Where are we goin'?
You don't know where you're goin'.

01:46:46.292 --> 01:46:47.960
We don't know Brooklyn. What's this?

01:46:48.044 --> 01:46:48.878
Right you are.

01:46:54.592 --> 01:46:55.593
Is this the right way?

01:46:55.676 --> 01:46:58.137
Do I know Brooklyn? Do I know the jungle?

01:47:13.694 --> 01:47:15.529
Yeah, you know Brooklyn.

01:47:15.947 --> 01:47:18.491
-Watch where you're goin'!
-I'm crazy!

01:47:18.574 --> 01:47:21.202
You're outta your mind.
Didn't you see that light?

01:47:21.285 --> 01:47:22.870
The light was red, right?

01:47:24.121 --> 01:47:26.749
-Slow down. Will you slow down?
-What does red mean?

01:47:26.791 --> 01:47:29.001
I wish you'd slow down your mouth a little.

01:47:34.423 --> 01:47:35.424
What is that guy, crazy?

01:47:35.508 --> 01:47:37.134
Hey, jerk!

01:47:37.385 --> 01:47:38.552
Now's the time!

01:47:48.020 --> 01:47:49.188
Get down!

01:47:55.528 --> 01:47:56.571
John!

01:47:56.821 --> 01:47:57.947
Johnny!

01:48:07.707 --> 01:48:08.749
Get down!

01:48:08.833 --> 01:48:11.335
Get down! Johnny!

01:50:33.936 --> 01:50:35.980
Good luck and God bless you.
