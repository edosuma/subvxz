"Greek Tragedy"
Closed Captioned

00:01.835 --> 00:03.002
Previously on 90210:

00:03.128 --> 00:04.588
Annie Wilson, will you marry me?

00:06.173 --> 00:06.632
(quietly):
No.

00:08.801 --> 00:10.010
Just so we're clear,
this is a loan.

00:10.135 --> 00:12.179
You're family, Navid,
and family should never say no.

00:12.304 --> 00:13.012
I have this meeting
with Juice Randall tomorrow

00:13.138 --> 00:14.515
and I only have two tracks done.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.099
I'm gonna have to pull
a all-nighter

00:16.224 --> 00:18.018
and I'm already
losing energy.

00:18.143 --> 00:21.146
I got my ADHD medication
here somewhere. Here you go.

00:21.271 --> 00:22.397
LIAM:
You are a reminder of what
happened this summer,

00:22.523 --> 00:24.065
but not just the accident.

00:24.191 --> 00:25.484
See, I was supposed

00:25.609 --> 00:27.611
to be comforting
my friend's wife.

00:27.736 --> 00:29.822
And instead, I
started falling for
her.

00:32.073 --> 00:33.492
We've needed a bigger
house for years,

00:33.617 --> 00:35.369
and then you came
along and stole it.

00:35.494 --> 00:36.537
You're the other bidder.

00:36.662 --> 00:38.372
You had me going through hell,

00:38.497 --> 00:40.666
even though I never had a chance
to get into Kappa.

00:40.791 --> 00:43.669
Your house was perfect
for Kappa, but you never were.

00:43.794 --> 00:44.252
I'm planning revenge
on that bitch Holly.

00:44.378 --> 00:46.755
What she did was awful.

00:46.881 --> 00:48.590
I'm gonna go drop out
of Kappa.

00:48.716 --> 00:51.301
No! No, no, no, you can't.
I need someone on the inside.

01:02.312 --> 01:03.939
(chuckles)

01:04.063 --> 01:06.525
Oh, look, the janitors
got new uniforms.

01:06.650 --> 01:08.569
I kind of preferred
the old ones.

01:08.694 --> 01:10.111
This one's very Sunset
streetwalker.

01:10.237 --> 01:12.280
Go to hell, Holly.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.115
This is all your fault.

01:14.241 --> 01:15.951
It may be my fault that you
terrorized the football team,

01:16.076 --> 01:17.244
but it's your fault

01:17.369 --> 01:18.829
the dean sentenced you
to community service.

01:18.954 --> 01:22.374
(chuckles) Please, I don't need
you or your stupid sorority.

01:22.499 --> 01:25.335
Right.

01:25.460 --> 01:27.922
Well, I guess we'll see you at
the Greek Mixer tomorrow night.

01:28.047 --> 01:30.340
Oh, wait.

01:30.465 --> 01:32.593
We won't because
it's for Greek members only.

01:32.718 --> 01:34.302
Too bad.

01:37.056 --> 01:38.599
Missed a spot.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.561

♪ ♪

01:50.736 --> 01:52.446
Mmm.

01:52.571 --> 01:53.530
Go!

01:53.655 --> 01:55.824
Later.
(laughs)

01:55.950 --> 01:56.992
You've been saying
that all week.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.786
There's no more later.

01:58.911 --> 02:01.246
You've a bar to open.

02:01.371 --> 02:03.373
Yeah, but this is more fun.

02:05.084 --> 02:06.752
This isn't gonna
pay the mortgage.

02:06.877 --> 02:09.463
Well, as long as they don't
repossess the bed, we're fine.

02:09.588 --> 02:11.673
(chuckles)

02:11.799 --> 02:15.010
Seriously,

02:15.135 --> 02:16.595
we can't keep
avoiding real life.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.806
Get out there and
scrub something.

02:18.931 --> 02:19.848
(groans)

02:19.974 --> 02:20.849
(laughs)

02:20.975 --> 02:22.768
Fine.

02:30.734 --> 02:31.944
You coming?

02:32.069 --> 02:33.445
In a minute.

03:00.305 --> 03:02.808
Nice coat. Does it come
with an igloo?
(chuckles)

03:02.933 --> 03:05.769
I stocked the walk-in with
eight-dozen cases of beer.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.481
So you and Jane seem cute
together.

03:09.606 --> 03:11.566
How's it going
with you guys?

03:11.692 --> 03:12.818
Yeah, can we not talk
about that?

03:12.943 --> 03:15.194
Sure.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.238
Is everything okay?

03:17.364 --> 03:20.617
Listen, with everything
that you did to Silver,

03:20.742 --> 03:23.495
it's just kind of hard
to pretend that we're friends.

03:24.955 --> 03:27.541
I mean, we've been working
together for a week.

03:28.667 --> 03:29.751
You hired me.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.586
As a favor to Dixon.

03:36.967 --> 03:39.178
Look, I'm happy to help you out
with a job,

03:39.302 --> 03:40.679
I really am,

03:40.804 --> 03:42.848
but let's just keep us
at coworkers, okay?

03:42.973 --> 03:44.975
Mm-hmm.

03:45.893 --> 03:48.103
(pop music playing)

03:51.106 --> 03:54.234
(both laughing)

03:54.359 --> 03:56.028
Don't lose eye contact.

03:59.073 --> 04:01.158
Yes! It is so good!
Dude.

04:02.784 --> 04:05.245
It's so... It's
like Jay-Z meets

04:05.370 --> 04:07.497
some crazy rave dance party
in the desert kind of good.

04:07.622 --> 04:08.999
You did it
in three days?

04:09.124 --> 04:12.044
Yeah. Yeah, I've been
really focused lately.

04:12.169 --> 04:14.295
And with Austin
gone for a week,

04:14.421 --> 04:16.130
I can get a lot of work done,

04:16.255 --> 04:18.175
especially wit him
not singing Garth

04:18.298 --> 04:19.466
or sweating Taylor.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.928
Taylor Swift is hot.
Yes.

04:22.053 --> 04:25.182
I mean, if you're into that
whole blonde, perfect smile,

04:25.306 --> 04:27.184
perfect voice type of thing,
which I'm clearly not.

04:27.308 --> 04:30.562
He's not making it better.
He has no idea.

04:30.687 --> 04:32.355
So, um, do you guys think
it's ready

04:32.480 --> 04:33.523
for Liam's bar opening?

04:33.648 --> 04:36.151
Definitely.
Are you kidding me?

04:36.276 --> 04:37.318
Don't-don't second-guess
yourself. It's perfect.

04:37.444 --> 04:39.279
Yeah.
All right,
all right, cool

04:39.404 --> 04:42.116
'cause the producer,
Juice Randall, he's coming,

04:42.241 --> 04:44.868
and if he likes it,

04:44.993 --> 04:45.911
there's no telling
what could happen.

04:46.036 --> 04:48.622
He could let me produce a track
on his next album.

04:48.747 --> 04:49.915
Mmm! It's amazing!

04:50.040 --> 04:51.708
(laughs)

04:51.833 --> 04:56.296
Oh, uh, but I kinda promised him
some stage time

04:56.421 --> 04:58.132
at the studio
for a discount.

04:58.257 --> 05:01.176
You know, the-the record company
kinda cut his budget.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.887
No, no problem, man.

05:04.012 --> 05:07.808
Just, uh, have him call
my, uh, my assistant.

05:07.933 --> 05:09.643
Call me. (laughs)
(Dixon laughs)

05:21.488 --> 05:22.614
(knocking)

05:24.950 --> 05:26.160
Knock, knock.

05:26.285 --> 05:27.202
Hi.
Hi.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.203
Hi.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.788
What's in the box?

05:29.913 --> 05:31.957
Oh, just some old junk.

05:32.082 --> 05:35.043
How's my newest Kappa sister
doing?

05:35.169 --> 05:37.712
Uh, I'm okay.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.881
You know,
it's just a big transition.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.382
Yeah, I totally know
how you feel.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.260
It's really hard leaving behind
family and friends.

05:43.384 --> 05:44.636
And speaking of friends,

05:44.761 --> 05:47.555
I'm sorry I was so harsh
with your friend Naomi.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.266
That's not usually
how I do things here.

05:49.390 --> 05:50.600
Oh, no. (scoffs) Naomi?

05:50.725 --> 05:53.187
I mean, we just went
to school together.

05:53.312 --> 05:54.604
We were never really that close.

05:54.729 --> 05:56.106
Makes sense.

05:56.231 --> 05:57.607
(chuckles)

05:57.732 --> 06:00.359
You're so sophisticated,
and she's so nouveau riche;

06:00.485 --> 06:02.654
living proof
you can't buy class.

06:02.779 --> 06:05.824
Anyway, now that
you're officially

06:05.949 --> 06:07.826
a Kappa girl, it's time
to pay your house dues.

06:07.951 --> 06:10.829
Uh, about that...

06:10.954 --> 06:14.333
Look, I was supposed to get
this inheritance money,

06:14.457 --> 06:17.127
and then things just got
really complicated.

06:17.252 --> 06:19.671
You think there's any way
that I could get an extension?

06:19.796 --> 06:21.048
Yeah, no worries.

06:21.173 --> 06:22.132
We'll figure something out.

06:22.257 --> 06:24.801
Actually, maybe
you could do me

06:24.926 --> 06:26.845
a favor in the meantime.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.555
Kappa is hosting the Greek Mixer
tomorrow night,

06:28.680 --> 06:31.308
and as you know, the house isn't
big enough to fit the crowd.

06:31.432 --> 06:32.767
So I've been looking
for other locations.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.770
I hear you know someone
who owns a beach bar.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.106
Maybe you could hook
a sister up?

06:38.232 --> 06:41.151
Oh... I-I-I don't know
about that.

06:41.276 --> 06:42.194
Liam and I are not exactly

06:42.319 --> 06:43.945
on the best
of terms.

06:44.071 --> 06:45.488
Oh.

06:45.613 --> 06:48.200
But you know what?

06:48.325 --> 06:49.743
That's no problem.

06:49.868 --> 06:53.288
Yeah, it's fine. I should
probably talk to him anyway.

06:53.412 --> 06:55.707
Thank you so much.
You're the best.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.167
Thanks.
Bye.

06:57.292 --> 06:58.126
I'll see you later.

07:02.421 --> 07:04.549
(loud rock playing)

07:08.427 --> 07:09.637
Hi.

07:14.976 --> 07:16.477
(music stops)

07:16.603 --> 07:17.812
Hi.

07:20.232 --> 07:23.777
Uh, well, look, I just came
to ask a favor.

07:23.902 --> 07:25.362
Not that I'm in any position

07:25.486 --> 07:26.821
to be asking
for favors

07:26.947 --> 07:30.033
right now, but I wanted
to see if you'd be able

07:30.158 --> 07:31.785
to host this thing
for my sorority tomorrow night.

07:31.910 --> 07:35.580
I know, it's so weird
I'm in a sorority.

07:35.705 --> 07:39.584
But yeah, I know you guys
haven't even opened yet,

07:39.709 --> 07:40.752
so if you're too busy,
I totally understand.

07:40.877 --> 07:43.713
No.

07:43.838 --> 07:45.132
No. I mean, it's great.

07:45.257 --> 07:47.801
It'll be, you know,

07:47.926 --> 07:49.386
great to get people in the door.

07:49.510 --> 07:50.387
Yeah.

07:50.511 --> 07:52.139
It's... it's great.

07:52.264 --> 07:54.641
Well, great.

07:54.766 --> 07:59.771
But, um, that's not really
why I came.

07:59.896 --> 08:01.815
I mean, it is,

08:01.940 --> 08:03.900
but it's not.

08:04.025 --> 08:05.986
I miss you, Liam.

08:06.111 --> 08:09.739
And I know that that sounds
crazy coming from the girl

08:09.864 --> 08:11.032
that turned down your
marriage proposal.

08:11.158 --> 08:11.741
Twice.

08:11.866 --> 08:14.786
Right, yeah.

08:14.911 --> 08:17.080
Look, I know that our
relationship has always been

08:17.205 --> 08:18.748
really complicated,

08:18.873 --> 08:20.459
but I don't know.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.961
I thought maybe
we could just

08:23.086 --> 08:25.297
start over and see
where it goes.

08:27.924 --> 08:32.511
Uh, maybe you'll even
ask me again sometime.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.308
Third time's a charm, right?

08:36.433 --> 08:37.517
Liam...

08:39.727 --> 08:42.688
I need to talk to you.

09:10.091 --> 09:12.427
Annie, wait!

09:12.552 --> 09:14.471
You proposed to me last week,

09:14.595 --> 09:15.889
and you're already sleeping
with somebody else?

09:16.014 --> 09:17.182
No, it's not like that.

09:17.307 --> 09:18.266
I met Jane over
the summer.

09:18.392 --> 09:21.686
What?! So you were with her

09:21.811 --> 09:24.731
before you proposed to me?
Oh, my God...

09:24.856 --> 09:28.402
I-I can't believe I spent
all this time missing you

09:28.527 --> 09:29.777
and you've just
been with her.

09:29.903 --> 09:30.862
I wasn't with her!

09:30.987 --> 09:31.821
I feel like such an idiot.

09:31.946 --> 09:33.990
I can't believe
that you would do this to me.

09:34.115 --> 09:35.200
You were the one
that turned me down.

09:35.325 --> 09:38.245
And it's a good thing
that I did!

09:38.370 --> 09:40.247
You said that you loved me
and that you wanted to spend

09:40.372 --> 09:41.498
the rest of your life with me.

09:41.622 --> 09:42.582
Were you just lying
the whole time?

09:42.707 --> 09:45.126
No, I did love you.

09:45.252 --> 09:46.794
I still love you. Just...

09:46.920 --> 09:49.548
You know what?
Save it for your new girlfriend.

10:04.271 --> 10:07.399
You proposed
to someone last week?

10:07.524 --> 10:10.110
I'm sorry. I should have told
you about Annie.

10:10.235 --> 10:12.237
We used to be together,

10:12.362 --> 10:14.697
and then everybody decided
they wanted to go to college.

10:14.822 --> 10:16.366
And I didn't know what I wanted.

10:16.491 --> 10:17.576
I just, I knew

10:17.700 --> 10:18.910
I didn't want that,
you know?

10:19.035 --> 10:20.454
So I left
to figure stuff out.

10:20.579 --> 10:22.830
And instead, I met you

10:22.956 --> 10:25.250
and...

10:25.375 --> 10:28.753
things got... you know.

10:30.505 --> 10:34.050
So I came back,
and Annie was here,

10:34.175 --> 10:35.802
and I asked her to marry me.

10:37.762 --> 10:39.931
I guess I didn't really know
what I wanted.

10:42.642 --> 10:43.768
You don't have to explain

10:43.893 --> 10:45.061
anything to me.

10:45.186 --> 10:47.063
Of course, you had
a life before me.

10:47.188 --> 10:48.648
I want to be with you.

10:48.773 --> 10:52.110
We're two people
in a lot of pain

10:52.235 --> 10:53.903
after someone close to us died.

10:54.028 --> 10:55.447
The truth is

10:55.572 --> 10:58.158
we both have lives
that are complicated

10:58.283 --> 11:02.036
enough as they are.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.246
I'm going back to Alaska.

11:03.371 --> 11:04.872
Don't... don't leave.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.500
I have to.

11:09.294 --> 11:11.212
SILVER:
Okay, for tomorrow,

11:11.338 --> 11:12.922
you have a conference call

11:13.047 --> 11:14.757
with some prospective
clients at 9:00.

11:14.882 --> 11:16.468
Okay.
You have a lunch
with the head

11:16.593 --> 11:17.969
of Buildings
and Grounds at 1:00.

11:18.094 --> 11:19.678
And then Juice,
who is Dixon's friend,

11:19.804 --> 11:21.306
starts on Stage Four.

11:21.431 --> 11:23.682
You really are
doing a great job.

11:23.808 --> 11:25.477
Thank you.

11:27.395 --> 11:28.771
No, thank you.

11:30.482 --> 11:32.442
Okay, why didn't you tell
me about your Uncle Amal?

11:32.567 --> 11:34.110
What about him?

11:34.235 --> 11:35.236
He's starting work over
there on Stage Seven.

11:35.362 --> 11:36.821
I met him this morning.

11:36.946 --> 11:38.490
He's a nice guy.

11:38.615 --> 11:40.617
Oh, uh, right.
I completely forgot.

11:40.741 --> 11:42.952
I'm actually going to go
catch up with him.

11:43.077 --> 11:44.371
Uh, see you at home?

11:44.496 --> 11:46.039
Yeah.
Okay.

11:46.164 --> 11:47.706
Bye.

11:54.339 --> 11:56.424
Keep up the good work.

11:56.550 --> 11:59.219
What do you think
you're doing here?

11:59.344 --> 12:02.597
You owe me money, and
I haven't seen a dime yet.

12:02.721 --> 12:06.142
So I decided that I will accept
rent-free stage time as payment

12:06.267 --> 12:08.478
until you square up.
Are you seriously
shooting porn back there?

12:08.603 --> 12:10.813
You know what, I don't
even want to know.

12:10.938 --> 12:12.731
It was a huge mistake
asking for your help.

12:12.857 --> 12:14.609
I will get you your money,

12:14.733 --> 12:16.528
and you're getting
the hell out of here.

12:18.655 --> 12:20.823
Oh, thank you
for the smoothie,

12:20.948 --> 12:23.910
but any chance you have some
vodka to spike it with?

12:24.035 --> 12:24.994
Rough day?

12:25.119 --> 12:27.121
Rough month.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.123
Well, lay it on me.
Max detail.

12:29.249 --> 12:32.085
I'm a psych major and I come
from a long line of head cases,

12:32.210 --> 12:34.837
so there is nothing that you
could say that would shock me.

12:34.962 --> 12:36.923
Okay, well, you know

12:37.048 --> 12:38.466
my ex-boyfriend

12:38.592 --> 12:41.094
who proposed to me,
has already found somebody new.

12:41.219 --> 12:42.679
Guys suck.

12:42.803 --> 12:45.390
And that is why you have
sorority sisters now.

12:46.725 --> 12:48.767
Hey, I've got some
friends visiting

12:48.893 --> 12:50.103
from out of town tomorrow.

12:50.228 --> 12:51.812
Why don't you come
have dinner with us?

12:51.938 --> 12:53.064
Take your mind off things.

12:53.189 --> 12:54.608
Oh, I can't.

12:54.733 --> 12:56.484
The cherry on top
of my sad sundae--

12:56.610 --> 12:57.444
I'm broke,

12:57.569 --> 12:59.362
and my parents
are tapped out.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.906
Can't even afford
my sorority dues.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.366
No worries.

13:03.491 --> 13:05.201
My friends are
totally rich.

13:05.326 --> 13:05.993
They'll pay for everything.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.371
Like everything.

13:08.496 --> 13:09.038
It's no big deal.

13:09.163 --> 13:10.873
So you'll come?

13:10.998 --> 13:12.417
Sure, why not?

13:12.542 --> 13:13.752
I mean, it can't get
much worse, right?

13:13.876 --> 13:17.547
Yay!

13:17.672 --> 13:19.048
NAOMI:
Agh!

13:19.173 --> 13:20.675
Worst day ever.

13:20.799 --> 13:22.552
What's up?

13:22.677 --> 13:24.763
I tried petitioning
the administration

13:24.887 --> 13:26.640
to let me start
my own sorority.

13:26.765 --> 13:28.266
And apparently,

13:28.391 --> 13:29.517
it's a whole process.

13:29.643 --> 13:31.102
Whatever happened
to the good old days

13:31.227 --> 13:33.271
when you could just buy
your way into high society?

13:33.396 --> 13:36.483
Girl, there was nothing
good about those days.
You look horrible.

13:36.608 --> 13:39.068
What have I told you about
moisturizer-- twice a day
keeps the bags away.

13:39.193 --> 13:40.987
Yeah, I know, all right?

13:41.112 --> 13:42.322
I just...

13:42.447 --> 13:45.908
Raj is in, like,
a lot of pain these days,

13:46.033 --> 13:47.619
and I can't, like,

13:47.744 --> 13:49.537
do anything about it,
you know.

13:49.663 --> 13:52.165
I just... I can't, like,
make it go away.

13:52.290 --> 13:54.501
It's just hard.

13:54.626 --> 13:56.169
I know exactly what
you mean about pain.

13:56.294 --> 13:57.878
Holly is torturing me.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.714
I mean, without being
part of Greek life

13:59.838 --> 14:01.174
I can't get into any
of the good parties.

14:01.299 --> 14:04.260
Yeah. Yeah, no, I, yeah.

14:04.385 --> 14:06.471
I mean, that's actually exactly
what I was talking about.

14:06.596 --> 14:08.765
That's exactly
what I'm going through.

14:08.889 --> 14:10.391
WOMAN: Slice of pie?
Because my husband's cancer

14:10.517 --> 14:13.728
equals not having
a social life.

14:13.852 --> 14:15.313
WOMAN:
Pie?

14:15.438 --> 14:18.107
Would you like a slice
of pie?

14:18.232 --> 14:20.360
Pie?

14:20.485 --> 14:22.069
NAOMI:
Oh, my God, that's it.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.781
That's it.

14:28.618 --> 14:30.953
So you're trying to
help save your charter?

14:31.078 --> 14:32.163
That's what the sign says.

14:32.288 --> 14:35.625
And do you have enough here
with your bake sale

14:35.750 --> 14:36.584
to cover everything?

14:36.710 --> 14:39.170
Oh, gosh no.
We're in the red pretty deep.

14:39.295 --> 14:42.131
Would you like to buy
another slice of pie?

14:42.256 --> 14:44.925
If you let me in
your sorority,

14:45.051 --> 14:46.344
I'll buy your entire charter.

14:46.469 --> 14:49.597
You want to be
in our sorority?

14:50.390 --> 14:53.226
Look at you and look at us.

14:53.351 --> 14:55.144
It's like before and after
pictures.

14:55.269 --> 14:58.606
I... I don't see the difference.

14:58.732 --> 15:01.150
I've always wanted
to be a Zeta Rho Phi.

15:01.275 --> 15:02.151
Pi.

15:02.276 --> 15:03.277
Whatever.

15:03.403 --> 15:04.028
What do say,
am I in?

15:04.153 --> 15:06.155
I don't think so.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.157
Give her a chance.
I like her shoes,

15:08.282 --> 15:09.868
and she smells like
lavender ice cream.

15:17.458 --> 15:18.626
Fine.

15:18.752 --> 15:19.544
Yay!
Yay!

15:27.218 --> 15:28.469
As your new president,

15:28.595 --> 15:30.971
I'd like to welcome you
to your new home.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.181
We get to live here?

15:32.306 --> 15:34.517
Cool. There's a pond
for my snakes.

15:34.642 --> 15:35.852
That's a dipping pool.

15:35.976 --> 15:37.270
The only time there'll be
snakes in that water

15:37.395 --> 15:38.646
is when we have frat guys over
for late-night soirees.

15:40.314 --> 15:41.524
All right, ladies,

15:41.649 --> 15:44.360
tonight is the first
Greek Mixer

15:44.485 --> 15:46.112
of the season, and
with the fashion gods

15:46.237 --> 15:47.988
as my witness, we will
make a good impression.

15:48.114 --> 15:50.032
Good thing I brought my
fashion god rosary beads.

15:50.157 --> 15:52.786
You. I wouldn't change
anything about you.

15:52.911 --> 15:53.953
Really?
No!

15:54.078 --> 15:56.831
See, sarcasm isn't
always funny.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.333
How is a guy going to know
you're flirting with him

15:59.459 --> 16:01.127
if he can't tell that
you're being serious?

16:01.252 --> 16:03.546
Those guys aren't worth my time.
(laughing) That's a good one.

16:03.671 --> 16:05.715
Alexis,

16:05.840 --> 16:08.384
you have an
incredible body.

16:08.509 --> 16:10.344
Bitch. It's almost
as good as mine.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.012
I dig the ink,

16:12.138 --> 16:14.766
but I don't like skulls
or dead unicorns.
It's art.

16:14.891 --> 16:16.350
Well, then hang it
at another gallery.

16:16.476 --> 16:19.145
Alana, I get it--

16:19.270 --> 16:21.564
geek is chic, but I'm
calling my hair stylist.

16:21.689 --> 16:24.984
You need a new look
from the neck up.

16:25.109 --> 16:27.403
And judging by the lip brow,

16:27.528 --> 16:29.238
perhaps a little grooming
from the waist down?

16:29.363 --> 16:31.699
Okay.

16:31.825 --> 16:33.451
You all are beautiful women.

16:33.576 --> 16:36.245
I see a bit of me
in each of you.

16:36.370 --> 16:37.580
And I love that part of me.

16:37.705 --> 16:40.875
And tonight, CU's
going to love it, too.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.670
(phone ringing)

16:43.795 --> 16:46.088
Shirazi Studios.
Silver speaking.

16:48.132 --> 16:50.176
You know, actually I'm going
to have you speak

16:50.301 --> 16:52.345
to Mr. Shirazi.
One second.

16:52.470 --> 16:53.930
Navid.
Yeah?

16:54.054 --> 16:55.389
Justin Bieber's manager

16:55.515 --> 16:57.517
is on the phone.
They're shooting a video.

16:57.642 --> 16:59.018
Stage flooded.
They need space immediately.

16:59.143 --> 17:00.269
We're booked.

17:00.394 --> 17:01.938
No, we're not.

17:02.062 --> 17:04.315
Hi. Navid Shirazi here.

17:04.440 --> 17:05.608
How may I help you?

17:05.733 --> 17:06.818
All right.

17:06.943 --> 17:08.109
Sure.

17:08.234 --> 17:10.029
That's very generous
of you,

17:10.154 --> 17:12.156
but it would cost us
at least that much

17:12.281 --> 17:13.491
to rearrange
our schedule.

17:13.616 --> 17:14.992
Add 20 grand

17:15.117 --> 17:17.118
to that number
and we have a deal.

17:17.243 --> 17:19.121
Great.
Well, I'll see you tonight.

17:19.246 --> 17:21.165
What are you doing?
We're booked.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.625
What else am I going to do?

17:22.750 --> 17:23.917
I need to make money somehow.

17:26.587 --> 17:28.673
Let's put them on Stage Four.

17:28.798 --> 17:30.424
No, no, no, that's where
Dixon's producer's working.

17:30.550 --> 17:33.052
Yeah. I'll talk to him.
I'm doing Dixon a favor anyway.

17:33.177 --> 17:34.971
Maybe he'll be okay

17:35.095 --> 17:36.430
if I give him a good deal
next week.

17:46.941 --> 17:48.985
Look who it is.

17:49.109 --> 17:50.486
You know,
I'm impressed.

17:50.611 --> 17:52.780
I rarely see people carry
their freshman 15 so well.

17:52.906 --> 17:54.615
I need tickets
to the Greek Mixer.

17:54.741 --> 17:58.244
Are you as dense as
you are undignified?

17:58.369 --> 18:00.454
You can't go because you're
not a member of a sorority.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.708
Not only am I a member of
the sorority, I'm the president.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.835
Of what, the new money,
no taste house?

18:05.960 --> 18:08.713
Zeta Rho Pi.

18:08.838 --> 18:10.464
You joined my big fat
Greek sorority?

18:10.590 --> 18:12.884
They're total losers.

18:13.009 --> 18:15.511
Of course they're losers.
That doesn't matter.

18:15.636 --> 18:18.765
All that matters
is that I'm in a sorority.

18:20.391 --> 18:22.351
Anyway, I think
you'll be quite impressed

18:22.476 --> 18:23.603
by their new look tonight.

18:23.728 --> 18:26.272
Well, you're lucky
it's a toga party.

18:26.397 --> 18:29.692
Drapery hides
a lot of flaws.

18:29.817 --> 18:31.485
As do masks.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.487
You should definitely
keep that in mind.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.031
Keep the change.

18:41.203 --> 18:43.539
Hey. Got some take-out
if you want some.

18:43.664 --> 18:47.043
Uh, no, thanks.
I'm not really hungry.

18:47.167 --> 18:49.253
Are you okay?

18:49.378 --> 18:52.381
I actually just booked
a flight home.

18:52.506 --> 18:54.884
Things didn't
work out with Liam.

19:02.349 --> 19:03.350
Because you're pregnant?

19:03.476 --> 19:05.812
I saw the home
pregnancy test

19:05.937 --> 19:07.229
in the girls' bathroom garbage.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.527
What am I going to do?

19:13.653 --> 19:15.362
I'm 20 years old.

19:15.488 --> 19:18.365
And the baby's father is dead.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.118
I can't do this alone.

19:20.242 --> 19:21.535
You're not alone.
You have Liam.

19:21.661 --> 19:24.038
This isn't going
to scare him off.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.915
Exactly. He'll feel like
he has to be with me

19:26.040 --> 19:28.334
even though he has feelings
for someone else.

19:28.459 --> 19:30.753
Promise me that you won't
say anything.

19:34.632 --> 19:37.343
Okay.

19:37.468 --> 19:38.761
I promise.

19:56.195 --> 19:59.281
My feet hurt, and we
haven't even walked yet.

19:59.406 --> 20:01.283
Must I go over
this again?

20:01.408 --> 20:03.661
What is rule number one?

20:03.786 --> 20:06.873
Sleep on your back so gravity
can fight age lines.

20:06.998 --> 20:09.208
Close, but that's
number five.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.794
Number one-- it's better to look
good than to feel good.

20:11.919 --> 20:14.797
That's right, Margene.
Good job.

20:14.922 --> 20:16.590
MARGENE:
I know this may sound silly,

20:16.716 --> 20:19.301
it's just, I don't usually
feel pretty

20:19.426 --> 20:20.720
and tonight I do.

20:20.845 --> 20:24.223
Margene, it's because
you are pretty.

20:24.348 --> 20:25.892
All of you are pretty.

20:26.017 --> 20:27.393
This is it, ladies.

20:27.518 --> 20:29.103
Remember the three Ps--

20:29.228 --> 20:33.566
Poise, posture, and when in
doubt, purse those lips.

20:33.691 --> 20:34.984
To Zeta Rho Pi, bitches.

20:35.109 --> 20:37.570
ALL:
To Zeta Rho Pi.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.749
ALEXIS:
I thought you said
this was a toga party.

20:49.874 --> 20:51.667
MARGENE:
Oh, my God.

20:51.792 --> 20:54.461

32:18.144 --> 32:19.688
But I know it was wrong,

32:19.813 --> 32:21.064
and I shouldn't
have hurt you like that.

32:23.817 --> 32:25.652
Then I saw you with that guy,
and I just...

32:25.778 --> 32:28.113
Oh, please, that...
that was so stupid.

32:28.238 --> 32:29.573
I'm sorry.
No, no.

32:29.698 --> 32:31.575
It's just...

32:31.700 --> 32:33.744
(sighs)

32:33.869 --> 32:35.370
It seems like we keep
hurting each other.

32:37.205 --> 32:38.749
I mean, if...

32:38.874 --> 32:41.877
if it's this complicated,
maybe it's just not meant to be.

32:42.001 --> 32:44.588
(sighs)

32:44.713 --> 32:49.217
Uh, yeah, I mean,
maybe you're right.

32:49.342 --> 32:50.135
(chuckles softly)

32:50.260 --> 32:51.887
I still love you, Annie.

32:52.011 --> 32:52.971
(laughs)

32:53.096 --> 32:54.932
I always will.

32:55.974 --> 32:56.642
You, too.

33:12.031 --> 33:14.200
♪ ♪

33:23.961 --> 33:25.754
Hi. Hey.

33:25.879 --> 33:27.130
Where you been? Dixon's
just finishing his set.

33:27.255 --> 33:29.508
I just
spoke to Juice.

33:29.633 --> 33:31.718
I totally screwed up.
He got so upset.

33:31.844 --> 33:32.845
Hey, guys.

33:33.887 --> 33:35.639
Um...
Hey.

33:35.764 --> 33:37.766
Have you seen Juice?
I-I don't think he showed up.

33:37.891 --> 33:40.936
Look, man, um, it's my fault
he's not here.

33:41.060 --> 33:43.605
W-What do you mean?

33:43.730 --> 33:46.525
I gave his stage space
to someone else last minute

33:46.650 --> 33:48.109
because th-they were
willing to pay more,

33:48.234 --> 33:49.110
and Juice got pissed.

33:49.235 --> 33:50.737
That's why he's not here.

33:50.863 --> 33:53.281
What the hell?

33:53.406 --> 33:55.283
Do you know how much
this means to me?

33:55.408 --> 33:57.160
Yeah.
Do you know how much
I worked for this?

33:57.285 --> 33:58.161
Yeah, I know.

33:58.286 --> 33:59.621
No, you don't!

33:59.746 --> 34:01.623
Because if you did,
then you wouldn't have done it!

34:01.748 --> 34:03.625
Dixon, bro..

34:06.085 --> 34:08.588
Whoa!

34:08.714 --> 34:09.755
Are you okay?
That's not like you.

34:09.882 --> 34:11.842
What's going on?

34:11.967 --> 34:13.259
I'm fine.

34:13.385 --> 34:15.012
I'm just tired.

34:15.136 --> 34:17.054
Haven't slept in two days 'cause
I been working on this set.

34:17.179 --> 34:18.974
I'm really sorry.

34:19.098 --> 34:20.475
Yeah, you should be.

34:34.531 --> 34:35.866
I don't want
you to leave.

34:37.909 --> 34:39.995
I have to.

34:40.119 --> 34:41.621
Listen, I've made a lot
of mistakes in my life,

34:41.746 --> 34:43.248
and I have hurt the
people that I love most,

34:43.373 --> 34:44.708
and I don't want
to do that anymore.

34:44.833 --> 34:47.126
I just want to be in
a good relationship,

34:47.252 --> 34:49.295
where you can be
open about stuff

34:49.420 --> 34:53.632
and talk or whatever
and be honest.

34:53.759 --> 34:54.592
And I want that with you.

35:01.099 --> 35:02.768
I'm pregnant.

35:04.603 --> 35:06.312
I know.

35:08.023 --> 35:09.482
Adrianna.

35:09.608 --> 35:11.985
She only told me
because she cares.

35:12.110 --> 35:14.362
Look, I don't know how
we're gonna live together

35:14.487 --> 35:17.950
or run a bar or
raise a baby.

35:18.075 --> 35:20.243
Matter of fact, I'm pretty
sure it's impossible.

35:20.368 --> 35:22.120
But I want to
give it a try.

35:24.957 --> 35:27.918
Most guys would run
the other way if they found out

35:28.043 --> 35:31.088
the girl they were seeing
is carrying someone else's baby.

35:31.212 --> 35:33.882
I'm not running away.

35:34.007 --> 35:35.092
I'm done running.

35:35.216 --> 35:37.510
I'm staying
right here.

35:37.636 --> 35:39.805
So, will you stay?

36:00.158 --> 36:03.954
Annie! Annie.

36:04.079 --> 36:06.498
Great night, right?

36:06.623 --> 36:07.958
Ugh, not really.

36:08.083 --> 36:09.626
I kind of just
want to go home.

36:09.751 --> 36:10.710
Too many drinks?

36:10.836 --> 36:13.088
I totally
understand.

36:13.212 --> 36:15.214
Maybe...

36:15.340 --> 36:18.051
this will make
you feel better.

36:18.176 --> 36:19.094
Uh, okay.

36:19.218 --> 36:21.387
What is this for?

36:21.513 --> 36:24.808
It's your... cut
for the night.

36:24.933 --> 36:26.309
From the guys.

36:28.603 --> 36:32.482
Wha... Oh, my God.

36:32.607 --> 36:35.193
They-They paid us to
hang out with them.

36:35.318 --> 36:37.154
Bree, we are like
prostitutes.

36:37.278 --> 36:38.071
No, we're not prostitutes.

36:38.196 --> 36:39.614
We're escorts.

36:39.739 --> 36:41.449
It's totally legal.

36:41.574 --> 36:43.576
My clients are
basically tourists,

36:43.702 --> 36:46.245
who just want to hang out
and get the local experience.

36:46.371 --> 36:47.580
I keep it completely "G."

36:49.166 --> 36:50.249
Well, at least I did

36:50.375 --> 36:52.418
until you went
and kissed that guy.

36:52.544 --> 36:53.879
Well...
If I'd known

36:54.004 --> 36:55.047
you were gonna
make out with him,

36:55.172 --> 36:56.048
I totally would've charged more.

36:56.173 --> 36:57.423
You tricked me.

36:57.549 --> 36:59.425
I-- No, Annie.

36:59.551 --> 37:01.887
I just, I wanted you to see
how fun we could have

37:02.012 --> 37:04.723
before you got all... judge-y.

37:04.848 --> 37:06.349
Well, it would not
have been as much fun

37:06.474 --> 37:07.726
had I known what was going on.

37:07.851 --> 37:09.728
I mean, the whole
thing is gross, okay?

37:09.853 --> 37:10.395
This money is dirty.

37:10.520 --> 37:12.564
Okay. Fine,
I can take it back.

37:14.191 --> 37:15.692
You know,
there would've been more,

37:15.817 --> 37:19.320
except I already
took out your sorority dues.

37:33.585 --> 37:35.336
Just want this day to be over.

37:39.925 --> 37:41.718
Why did you need
the money so badly

37:41.843 --> 37:42.969
that you bumped
Juice for Justin?

37:43.095 --> 37:44.804
I'm running a business, Silver.

37:44.930 --> 37:47.182
You saw for yourself,
we're not turning a profit.

37:48.266 --> 37:49.809
I have to change that.

37:51.853 --> 37:52.812
Okay.

37:52.938 --> 37:54.397
But I feel like you're
not telling me something.

37:54.522 --> 37:56.691
Can we please
just drop it?
No.

37:56.816 --> 37:58.985
Look, I'm a part of
Shirazi Studios, too.

37:59.111 --> 38:00.987
If something is wrong,
you got to let me in.

38:01.113 --> 38:03.907
Come on, we're
in this together.

38:04.032 --> 38:06.076
Right?

38:06.201 --> 38:08.995
No, you're right.

38:09.121 --> 38:10.789
Okay.

38:10.914 --> 38:11.623
I have been keeping
something from you.

38:14.251 --> 38:15.127
(sighs)

38:15.252 --> 38:16.628
(sighs)

38:20.882 --> 38:22.634
I don't, I don't think
we should be working together.

38:24.469 --> 38:27.013
So you're firing me?

38:27.139 --> 38:28.640
No, that's not...
You just told
me yesterday

38:28.765 --> 38:29.307
what a great
job I'm doing.

38:29.432 --> 38:31.350
You were doing a great job.

38:31.476 --> 38:33.311
Then what is this?
It's...

38:35.272 --> 38:37.107
I want to protect you.

38:37.232 --> 38:40.152
Protect me from what?

38:40.277 --> 38:41.153
I...

38:41.278 --> 38:42.654
What is going on?

38:42.779 --> 38:45.282
Come on. I love you,
and I want to help you.

38:45.406 --> 38:47.242
I know, and I love you, too,
and that's part of the reason

38:47.366 --> 38:48.285
I can't tell you
what's going on.

38:50.120 --> 38:51.871
I just need you to trust me.

38:51.997 --> 38:53.748
Okay?

39:00.338 --> 39:01.798
Silver.

39:20.608 --> 39:22.735
If you're here
to get back at me

39:22.861 --> 39:25.197
for what I did, I'm not even
gonna put up a fight.

39:25.322 --> 39:26.906
You can yell at me, hit me,

39:27.032 --> 39:29.284
throw me into the dipping pool,
whatever you want.

39:29.408 --> 39:30.035
I know I deserve it.

39:30.160 --> 39:31.494
You do deserve it.

39:31.619 --> 39:34.080
But that's not why we're here.

39:34.206 --> 39:35.790
MARGENE:
We talked about it,
and we know you're sorry.

39:35.915 --> 39:36.875
People make mistakes.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.294
Part of being a sorority sister
is accepting each other,

39:39.418 --> 39:40.295
faults and all.

39:40.419 --> 39:41.671
I lied to you.

39:41.796 --> 39:43.422
I ruined your night.

39:43.548 --> 39:46.509
True, but I got a guy's number,
and he's taller than me.

39:46.634 --> 39:48.469
Our babies would totally
rule the galaxy.

39:48.594 --> 39:50.263
(laughter)

39:50.388 --> 39:52.390
And my gladiator
asked me out to dinner.

39:52.515 --> 39:56.477
It turns out, we have matching
dead unicorn tattoos.

39:58.021 --> 39:58.855
Sometimes the
darkest nights

39:58.980 --> 39:59.522
give rise to
brightest mornings.

40:01.691 --> 40:03.860
Sometimes good comes from bad.

40:03.985 --> 40:05.320
Despite all the bad parts

40:05.444 --> 40:08.073
of tonight, it
was actually

40:08.198 --> 40:09.615
one of the best nights
our sorority's ever had.

40:12.911 --> 40:15.496
And that's all because of you.

40:15.621 --> 40:17.249
MARGENE:
And so we refuse

40:17.374 --> 40:19.334
to accept your resignation.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.298
Guys, I don't deserve this.
We know.

40:25.423 --> 40:27.175
Sisters?

40:29.427 --> 40:30.678
Sisters.

40:30.803 --> 40:32.389
Now that our troops
are in line,

40:32.513 --> 40:34.515
we have a common enemy
to attack.

40:34.640 --> 40:35.433
We do?

40:35.558 --> 40:37.227
Holly. She made us
look like fools,

40:37.352 --> 40:39.979
and she called us losers.

40:40.105 --> 40:41.647
Another part of being
a sorority sister

40:41.773 --> 40:42.107
is having each
other's backs.

40:42.232 --> 40:44.025
So what do you say?

40:44.150 --> 40:45.693
Should we give Holly a
dose of her own medicine?

40:46.986 --> 40:49.572
I say the bitch is going down.

40:49.697 --> 40:50.573
Yes!

40:50.698 --> 40:52.992
(laughter)

41:04.462 --> 41:05.838
Find anything yet?

41:07.882 --> 41:09.884
Look at this.

41:12.095 --> 41:13.596
(chuckles)

41:13.721 --> 41:15.598
I knew Annie
was hiding something.

41:15.723 --> 41:17.725
Perfect.

41:19.936 --> 41:21.729
It's a love letter from

41:21.854 --> 41:24.190
Naomi's ex-boyfriend
breaking her heart.

41:24.316 --> 41:25.900
Aw.

41:26.025 --> 41:27.402
This'll come in handy when
I'm bringing that bitch down.
