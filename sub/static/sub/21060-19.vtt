-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.433 --> 00:36.500
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.533 --> 00:39.067
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:39.100 --> 00:40.933
in a court of law.

00:42.867 --> 00:45.800
-Bronson: I definitely enjoy
the investigative aspect.

00:45.833 --> 00:48.267
I like hunting down suspects.

00:48.300 --> 00:51.400
I like trying to dig
and find out what I can,

00:51.433 --> 00:55.033
um, get to know them
as best as I can even though
they-- I don't know them,

00:55.067 --> 00:57.933
or they don't know me,
and just locating them

00:57.967 --> 01:02.967
and, uh, getting justice
for the victim, pretty much.

01:03.067 --> 01:05.100
So right now
we're attempting to locate

01:05.133 --> 01:07.600
a subject, uh,
that is known to District 3

01:07.633 --> 01:10.333
as the Target of the Month
for the month of March.

01:10.367 --> 01:12.500
Uh, we're trying to locate
the subject.

01:12.533 --> 01:15.133
He's got a warrant, uh,
violation of probation,

01:15.167 --> 01:17.867
burglary, and fleeing to elude.

01:17.900 --> 01:22.100
Uh, so we're tryin' to, uh,
go to one of the many addresses

01:22.133 --> 01:23.267
that he's known to be at,

01:23.300 --> 01:27.367
um, see if we can, uh,
locate him.

01:27.400 --> 01:31.067
-Dispatcher: 10-4.
The owner's reporting dogs
that are constantly barking.

01:38.800 --> 01:39.800
-Man on radio:
10-4.

01:43.767 --> 01:48.067
An open window.
I'm gonna go... back, back.

02:00.700 --> 02:02.500
-Officer on radio:
I'm goin' inside.
I'm goin' inside.

02:08.600 --> 02:10.500
-(indistinct radio chatter)

02:10.533 --> 02:12.067
-Bronson:
Hey, hey! Stop!

02:13.367 --> 02:14.933
3-86-2, 10-31.

02:17.900 --> 02:19.400
On foot!

02:19.433 --> 02:22.733
We're heading southbound
through the-- through
the residential--

02:22.767 --> 02:23.833
-Man:
Ooh-ooh!

02:23.867 --> 02:26.767
-(Bronson breathing hard)

02:26.800 --> 02:28.300
Stop!

02:28.333 --> 02:30.433
-Officer:
You're not gonna make it!
You're not gonna make it, buddy.

02:35.667 --> 02:38.900
-(man yelling)
-Officer: Get your hands
behind your back!

02:43.133 --> 02:45.133
Let me see
your other hand, Kevin!

02:45.167 --> 02:46.600
-Hi, 6-2, we're 10-12.

02:51.767 --> 02:55.100
We're gonna be on the street
just south of Oak.

02:55.133 --> 02:56.167
-Why do you guys
want me so bad?

02:56.200 --> 02:58.400
-'Cause you got a warrant.

02:58.433 --> 03:01.067
Please turn around.

03:01.100 --> 03:03.367
Got anything
in your pockets, Kevin?
-No.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.100
-Hey, try to sit up
for us, okay?

03:05.133 --> 03:06.400
Can you sit up for us?
-I can't.

03:06.433 --> 03:07.833
-Yes, you can.

03:08.933 --> 03:11.500
-(Kevin mumbles)

03:12.533 --> 03:13.600
-Bronson:
You're all right.

03:14.967 --> 03:16.067
-Thanks, man.

03:17.467 --> 03:19.267
-(exhaling)

03:20.833 --> 03:21.967
-Why'd you run?

03:23.067 --> 03:24.367
-Scared.
I didn't wanna go to jail.

03:24.400 --> 03:26.367
-What are you scared about?
-Just didn't wanna go to jail.

03:26.400 --> 03:28.367
-You didn't wanna go to jail?

03:28.400 --> 03:30.867
-I got work tomorrow.
I didn't wanna go, and...

03:30.900 --> 03:32.667
-Why didn't you just
turn yourself in?

03:32.700 --> 03:34.633
Could've been a lot easier.

03:34.667 --> 03:36.067
-(sighs)
I know.

03:36.100 --> 03:39.167
-Right?
You been runnin'
for a while, right?

03:39.200 --> 03:41.267
I mean, I don't mean today.
I just mean in general.

03:41.300 --> 03:45.800
-Oh, um...
I just picked a dumb thing,
goin' on probation.

03:45.833 --> 03:48.267
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

03:48.300 --> 03:51.400
-Well, you kinda made it
a little worse, okay?

03:51.433 --> 03:53.167
'Cause you caught
another charge.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.733
-Resisting arrest.
-Resisting without violence.

03:55.767 --> 03:57.500
-Yeah.

03:57.533 --> 03:59.567
-On top of your others.

03:59.600 --> 04:00.967
You understand?
-Yeah.

04:02.733 --> 04:04.500
-Hang tight, okay?
-Yep.

04:06.533 --> 04:08.600
-Reagan:
All right, what happened
when you got to the door?

04:08.633 --> 04:11.733
-Schaub: I got to the door,
I saw someone that looked
similar to Kevin,

04:11.767 --> 04:14.367
I said, "Kevin," twice.
He said, "No, I'm Scott,

04:14.400 --> 04:15.900
but Kevin's inside."

04:15.933 --> 04:17.467
He immediately let me inside.

04:17.500 --> 04:19.333
As soon as I went inside,
I got on the radio,

04:19.367 --> 04:21.400
keyed up, let you guys know
I was goin' inside,

04:21.433 --> 04:24.067
um, lost visual of him,
and that's when I heard

04:24.067 --> 04:28.067
Bronson was in a foot pursuit,
and I found out that you guys
later made contact with him.

04:28.100 --> 04:29.800
-Yeah, well, I was behind
the wrong house.

04:29.833 --> 04:31.633
I heard you-- I heard you
get on the radio,

04:31.667 --> 04:33.867
say that we were-- that you
were goin' in,

04:33.900 --> 04:37.567
I heard you call a 10-31,
and I just s-- I had to sit
at the back of the house

04:37.600 --> 04:39.967
with the fence, and just
wait to see where you were gonna
come from.

04:40.067 --> 04:42.767
-Yeah.
-That's when I saw him running.
You were behind him,

04:42.800 --> 04:45.833
and then that's when we gave--
that we were in 10-30--
or pursuit,

04:45.867 --> 04:47.400
and we ended up tackling him
up over here.

04:47.433 --> 04:49.467
-Yeah, that was
a good catch, man.
Good tackle.

04:49.500 --> 04:50.500
-It was awesome.

04:50.533 --> 04:52.067
This is Dad.

04:52.100 --> 04:54.867
What's up, man?
-We're gonna let you
talk to him if you want to.

04:54.900 --> 04:56.833
-Yeah, okay.
Thank you.

04:56.867 --> 04:58.467
-Uh, just briefly, okay?
-All right.

04:58.500 --> 05:00.300
-'Cause we need to get going.

05:01.967 --> 05:04.567
-Hey, what's-- what's up?
-(Kevin mumbles)

05:04.600 --> 05:06.767
I might not be around
for a while.

05:06.800 --> 05:09.900
-Well, give us a call
when you get there.

05:09.933 --> 05:13.200
-Yeah.
-You got your-- you got
your free minute or so,

05:13.233 --> 05:17.967
and-- on the phone.
Give us a call and we'll--

05:18.067 --> 05:19.467
we'll find out what's goin' on.

05:19.500 --> 05:21.467
-Yeah.
-When you get, uh...

05:22.533 --> 05:25.433
give us further notice.
-Yep.

05:25.467 --> 05:28.100
-All right?
-Yeah.

05:28.133 --> 05:29.300
-All right, talk to you
in a while.

05:29.333 --> 05:31.233
-All right, tell her
I'll call her soon.

05:31.267 --> 05:33.467
-All right.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.067
-Bronson:
So, with you runnin' today,

05:35.067 --> 05:37.200
did you think you were
gonna get away?

05:37.233 --> 05:38.700
I mean, you seem--
-No.

05:38.733 --> 05:39.733
-No?
-No.

05:39.767 --> 05:40.967
-So why even try? Why--

05:41.067 --> 05:43.067
-It was the dumbest (bleep)
thing I've ever done.

05:43.100 --> 05:47.067
-Yeah.
-I just-- I don't know why,
I just-- I don't know why

05:47.067 --> 05:50.300
I do that (bleep).
I really don't. When it's
just, like, just-- whatever,

05:50.333 --> 05:52.900
you came there, you seen me,
you shoulda just took me, like--

05:52.933 --> 05:57.167
I don't know why I do that.
-Well, listen, you're gonna
go ahead and take care--

05:57.200 --> 05:59.633
care of everything now, right?

05:59.667 --> 06:02.100
-And be locked up, though.
-Hopefully, start off
with a clean slate

06:02.133 --> 06:03.500
once you take care
of everything.

06:03.533 --> 06:05.200
-I'll be gone for a while.

06:08.433 --> 06:09.767
-Is that why
you were runnin'?

06:09.800 --> 06:11.800
'Cause you figured
you were gonna be
gone for a while?

06:11.833 --> 06:15.100
-Yeah, that I'm lookin' at
at least five years,

06:15.133 --> 06:18.600
so I figured...
"What the hell."

06:18.633 --> 06:20.433
-Do you understand
your charges today?

06:20.467 --> 06:23.967
The violation of your probation,
the warrant that you had out
since August of last year,

06:24.067 --> 06:27.233
and then, uh, the resisting
without violence, and then,
you-- you provided

06:27.267 --> 06:32.567
the-- the false name
to Leo, which is my partner
back there, at the front door.

06:34.500 --> 06:35.700
All right?

06:35.733 --> 06:38.100
Do you have
any questions for me?

06:38.133 --> 06:40.367
-No.
-All right, man, well,
I wish you luck.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.900
-(radio chatter)
-I hope-- I hope things
get better for you, okay?

06:43.933 --> 06:46.267
-Yeah, I hope so, too.
-All right, buddy.

06:46.300 --> 06:47.300
-All right, ma'am.
Thank you.

06:47.333 --> 06:48.600
-Yeah.

06:50.467 --> 06:52.467
-Reagan: We'd been
to the house a few times.
-Bronson: Yeah.

06:52.500 --> 06:54.600
I heard something about
him hiding in the mattress?

06:54.633 --> 06:57.233
-Yeah.
Mom cut out a-- a hole
in the box spring.

06:57.267 --> 06:59.133
That's where
he'll stash at-- yeah.
-That's pretty clever.

06:59.167 --> 07:00.600
-Yeah.
-He wasn't too clever
today, though.

07:00.633 --> 07:01.667
-No.
-No.

07:01.700 --> 07:03.167
-He likes to run.
-Exactly.

07:06.067 --> 07:07.900
-Blaszyk:
I was the Army for five years.

07:07.933 --> 07:08.967
Military Police.

07:09.067 --> 07:12.067
And then, decided to come
to Martin County.

07:12.067 --> 07:15.667
It's a great agency.
The Sheriff's Office
really takes care of you.

07:15.700 --> 07:17.433
Lotta good people
live in Martin County.

07:17.467 --> 07:19.300
They-- they really love
the Sheriff's Office.

07:19.333 --> 07:21.733
It motivates you to make sure
that they don't have to worry

07:21.767 --> 07:24.467
at night when they're sleepin',
that we're gonna be out here,

07:24.500 --> 07:26.567
checkin' and keepin' an eye
on their property

07:26.600 --> 07:28.833
and their-- their community.

07:31.200 --> 07:34.567
All right, this vehicle
we're stoppin' for no tag light.

07:34.600 --> 07:36.633
He's out of Palm Beach.
We've been havin' a lot
of burglaries,

07:36.667 --> 07:39.200
where they've been takin',
uh, boat motors...

07:41.267 --> 07:43.867
Boat motors with, uh, SUVs.

07:43.900 --> 07:46.833
So far, he's not stoppin.
-(siren blaring)

07:48.433 --> 07:49.800
-(radio chirps)

07:49.833 --> 07:52.967
-If you could advise
St. Lucie County.

07:53.067 --> 07:55.600
Maybe they got someone
closer to the county line
with sticks?

07:55.633 --> 07:58.833
-Man on radio:
3-0-4, I got sticks
just north of Britt Road.

07:58.867 --> 08:04.067
-(siren continues)
-Uh, we're doin' 50.
All right, so we're gonna

08:04.100 --> 08:06.800
put out some stop sticks
that we can stop
this vehicle

08:06.833 --> 08:08.267
we have fleeing and eluding.

08:08.300 --> 08:11.867
Um... so we're gonna stop
and see what happens.

08:11.900 --> 08:14.100
-Man on radio:
Back off a little bit,
so you don't hit the sticks.

08:14.133 --> 08:15.633
Careful.

08:15.667 --> 08:18.167
-Blaszyk:
There he is on the right
with the sticks.

08:18.200 --> 08:20.467
-(siren continues)

08:20.500 --> 08:22.600
-Man on radio:
10-4, I got sticks.

08:22.633 --> 08:24.300
-Blaszyk:
He's hit the stop sticks.

08:27.133 --> 08:29.167
-Man on radio:
I want all units
just to back off,

08:29.200 --> 08:31.733
let the air out of 'em
until he stops.

08:31.767 --> 08:34.533
-(siren continues)

08:34.567 --> 08:36.900
-Man on radio:
He's slowing down.
Only doing right 40 now.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.767
We're gonna wait
till he comes to a stop,
surround him and take him out.

08:39.800 --> 08:41.267
-Blaszyk:
Here we go, here we go.

08:43.300 --> 08:44.833
-Man on radio:
He's stopped full here.

08:48.467 --> 08:50.733
-Get out the car!

08:50.767 --> 08:52.267
Drop the keys!

08:52.300 --> 08:55.067
Step out!
Back up to me!

08:55.067 --> 08:57.167
Turn around!
Turn around! Back up!

08:57.200 --> 08:58.900
Back up!
Keep walkin'!

08:58.933 --> 09:00.167
Keep walkin'!

09:02.267 --> 09:03.567
Keep walkin'!

09:03.600 --> 09:05.900
-Officer: Hey, everyone?
Hold on until we get
one secured.

09:05.933 --> 09:08.933
-Blaszyk:
Keep comin',
keep comin', keep comin'.

09:08.967 --> 09:11.167
-Everyone?
-Blaszyk: Keep comin',
keep comin'.

09:11.200 --> 09:12.933
Lay down on the ground.

09:12.967 --> 09:14.433
Get on the ground.

09:17.900 --> 09:19.667
What you runnin' for, dude?

09:19.700 --> 09:21.133
-Man:
I had weed in the car tonight.

09:21.167 --> 09:22.733
-Officer 2:
Right here in his hand.

09:22.767 --> 09:24.833
-Blaszyk: You're runnin'
because you had a little
weed on you?

09:24.867 --> 09:26.500
That little bag
you had in your hand?

09:27.833 --> 09:30.133
That's... a pretty stupid
reason to run.

09:30.167 --> 09:33.067
-(radio chatter)
-In a vehicle.

09:34.667 --> 09:36.300
Just lean up against the car.

09:37.933 --> 09:39.667
Nothin' else on you
or in you, right?

09:39.700 --> 09:41.967
'Cause we're goin' to the jail,
so it'll be another felony.

09:42.067 --> 09:44.967
-No...
-No? Okay.
Step back with me.

09:47.867 --> 09:50.700
All right, man, just
have a seat, I'll be back
with you in a second, okay?

09:50.733 --> 09:52.967
What's your name?
-Jonte.

09:53.067 --> 09:54.067
-Jonte?
-Yeah.

09:54.100 --> 09:56.267
-All right, Jonte.
Why you runnin' from me?

09:56.300 --> 10:00.467
'Cause the weed?
Is that the only reason
you ran for?

10:00.500 --> 10:05.233
-(mumbles)

10:05.267 --> 10:06.667
Well, look at me, um...

10:06.700 --> 10:09.200
-I know it's-- it's a lot
to deal with, but it's over now.

10:09.233 --> 10:12.933
-I made somethin' bigger
than it was, 'cause I had weed.
I was just scared, bro.

10:12.967 --> 10:14.100
-Just scared?
-Yeah.

10:14.133 --> 10:16.100
-Scared of me?
-Yeah, I'm scared of police.

10:16.133 --> 10:19.200
-Why are you
scared of me, dude?
I don't know you.

10:19.233 --> 10:21.300
-Why?
Y'all kill people.

10:21.333 --> 10:22.833
-Oh, come on, man,
I don't wanna hear that.

10:22.867 --> 10:24.000
-Y'all kill black males.

10:24.033 --> 10:25.333
-I woulda-- You know
what I woulda done?

10:25.367 --> 10:26.600
I'd a wrote you a ticket.
That was it.

10:26.633 --> 10:28.467
Now you gotta go to jail.
I gotta tow your car.

10:28.500 --> 10:31.600
Your car's got a bunch
of flat tires 'cause you ran
from me.

10:31.633 --> 10:34.267
All right?
Now you get a felony
fleeing and eluding.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.367
You know what I'm sayin'?

10:35.400 --> 10:37.633
All for some
little baggie of weed.

10:37.667 --> 10:39.767
Okay? Now we're tearin' up
the car right now,

10:39.800 --> 10:41.367
I'm not gonna find
nothin' else, right?

10:41.400 --> 10:43.367
-That's true.
-Where you from?

10:43.400 --> 10:44.500
-Palm Beach.
-From Palm Beach?

10:44.533 --> 10:45.700
What you doin' up here?

10:45.733 --> 10:47.400
-Oh, just pickin' up
my boy.

10:47.433 --> 10:49.133
-Pickin' up your boy?
-Yeah.

10:49.167 --> 10:50.833
Okay, let me go talk
to your friend over here.

10:50.867 --> 10:51.900
Just sit tight.

10:55.433 --> 10:57.233
All right, man.
Where y'all comin' from?

10:57.267 --> 11:00.067
-Uh, I'm just catchin' a ride,
so I'm a passenger, sir.

11:00.067 --> 11:01.600
-You're a passenger?
-Yes, sir.

11:01.633 --> 11:03.667
-You're a passenger,
you just a had a little bit
of weed on you?

11:03.700 --> 11:06.500
-Yeah, I got a little bud.
I didn't even know
that was here.

11:06.533 --> 11:09.167
That's all, all right?
-What was with that
little half a pill,

11:09.200 --> 11:10.667
whatever that was?

11:10.700 --> 11:12.833
-That was mine, sir.
-That was yours?

11:12.867 --> 11:14.233
-I got anxiety.
-You got anxiety?

11:14.267 --> 11:16.333
-Yes, sir.
-All right.
What, uh--

11:16.367 --> 11:18.100
what-- what was your boy
runnin' from?

11:18.133 --> 11:21.333
-I haven't-- I don't--
that's not my boy, sir.
I just caught a ride, sir.

11:21.367 --> 11:22.533
I'm catchin' a ride.

11:22.567 --> 11:23.567
-You catchin' a ride
to where?

11:23.600 --> 11:25.600
-Back home, sir,
Riviera Beach.

11:25.633 --> 11:27.067
-Where--
home is in Riviera?

11:27.100 --> 11:28.167
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

11:28.200 --> 11:30.233
All right, just sit tight.

11:30.267 --> 11:32.433
Let's go check out the car.

11:32.467 --> 11:33.833
This is where the sticks hit.

11:33.867 --> 11:36.733
-(radio chatter)
-Typically, when--
when someone's trying

11:36.767 --> 11:39.500
to hide somethin', they like
to hide it around them,
real close,

11:39.533 --> 11:42.367
'cause that's all
they have time to do,
without lookin' too obvious.

11:42.400 --> 11:44.867
So I like to check, uh,
around their immediate area.

11:44.900 --> 11:48.867
In the door,
underneath the seat,
in between the seat.

11:50.933 --> 11:54.067
There's a lotta trash,
a lotta stuff in this car.

11:54.067 --> 11:55.900
Just gotta go through it all.

11:58.767 --> 12:04.133
All right, there's like,
a, uh... a little white--
a little clear bag.

12:04.167 --> 12:08.267
-(radio chatter)
-It's got, uh, residue
in it, possibly heroin.

12:08.300 --> 12:11.200
We'll have to field test it
and see what it comes back to.

12:11.233 --> 12:14.767
But that was obviously
stuffed there from the driver.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.633
Okay, man, well, listen up.
You both are gonna
go to jail, okay?

12:17.667 --> 12:19.567
-Yes, sir.
-All right.
Given all that,

12:19.600 --> 12:21.733
I can't just write you a ticket
when I'm chasin' cars

12:21.767 --> 12:24.500
and flattenin' tires.
I got helicopters
followin' you,

12:24.533 --> 12:26.200
you know what I'm sayin'?
-Yes, sir.

12:26.233 --> 12:27.567
-So you're gonna go up
to the county jail

12:27.600 --> 12:28.900
for your possession
of marijuana charge,

12:28.933 --> 12:30.933
and, uh, you'll be able
to bond out and go home, okay?

12:30.967 --> 12:33.667
-I gotta get
expedited back to Riv--
-You gotta get what?

12:33.700 --> 12:35.633
-Expedited.
-Expedited?

12:35.667 --> 12:37.267
-Yeah.
'Cause this isn't my county.

12:37.300 --> 12:39.500
-You gotta get extradited.
-Extradited. Yeah.

12:39.533 --> 12:41.700
-No, you're just gonna bond out,
they're gonna let you go home.

12:41.733 --> 12:43.333
That's it.
You just have to get a ride.

12:43.367 --> 12:44.733
Why?
You got a warrant?

12:44.767 --> 12:46.233
-No.
-No, then, you're just
gonna go home.

12:46.267 --> 12:47.667
That's it.
It's over.

12:47.700 --> 12:50.200
This next time,
be careful who you
get in the car with, okay?

12:53.833 --> 12:55.767
All right, Jonte,
this is what's goin' on, man.

12:55.800 --> 12:57.367
Obviously, you know
what happened, right?

12:57.400 --> 13:01.267
We got in a--
we got in a chase, all the tires
are flat, um...

13:01.300 --> 13:02.867
that is fleeing
and eluding, okay?

13:02.900 --> 13:05.133
And when you do somethin'
like that, I c-- I can't
cut you no breaks,

13:05.167 --> 13:07.567
I can't write you a ticket
and tell you to go home, okay?

13:07.600 --> 13:11.067
So we're gonna go up
to Martin County Jail,
they'll give you a bond,

13:11.067 --> 13:14.367
you'll post bond
up there, bond out
and-- and go home, okay?

13:14.400 --> 13:16.800
-All right.
-Next time the lights come on,
the sirens come on,

13:16.833 --> 13:19.967
just-- just stop,
you know, and walk away
with a ticket

13:20.067 --> 13:22.067
instead of all this drama.

13:22.100 --> 13:23.900
All for some
little baggie of weed.

13:26.600 --> 13:28.233
-Milazzo:
Lafayette's a great city
to live in.

13:28.267 --> 13:29.633
I love livin' here.

13:29.667 --> 13:31.500
Every weekend there seems
there's some kind of festival.

13:31.533 --> 13:34.067
They have great music.
The food's amazing.

13:34.067 --> 13:36.433
Uh, the social scene,
the night life.

13:36.467 --> 13:37.600
Very diverse.

13:37.633 --> 13:39.433
They have
a great university here.

13:39.467 --> 13:42.467
Uh, a lotta college sports
are played in the city.

13:42.500 --> 13:44.733
Overall, it's just great.
It's not hard to find
somethin' to do

13:44.767 --> 13:47.567
while you're here.
-Dispatcher on radio: 133?

13:47.600 --> 13:50.633
-Be code 20, it's gonna be
a switched plate.

13:50.667 --> 13:53.367
It's on a black GMC Envoy.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.200
We're gonna conduct
a traffic stop on this vehicle.

13:55.233 --> 13:56.567
It's got
a switched license plate.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.267
The plate's comin' back
to a different type of vehicle,

13:58.300 --> 14:00.667
so we're gonna
contact the driver and see
what's goin' on with it.

14:03.067 --> 14:04.600
-Dispatcher:
133?

14:04.633 --> 14:07.333
-Uh, we'll be at 49
northbound onramp.

14:07.367 --> 14:11.300
Will you start me another unit?
It's takin' a while to stop.

14:11.333 --> 14:14.333
-(radio chatter)
-Driver, step out the vehicle.

14:14.367 --> 14:18.867
-(radio chatter)

14:18.900 --> 14:20.967
-Driver, step out
of the vehicle!

14:23.167 --> 14:24.733
Step back here.

14:24.767 --> 14:26.967
Walk to the front
of my car.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.700
Who's in the vehicle
with you?

14:28.733 --> 14:29.833
-Just me and my girlfriend.

14:29.867 --> 14:31.800
Okay. Put your hands
on my push bumper.

14:31.833 --> 14:33.267
Put your hands
on my push bumper.

14:33.300 --> 14:34.300
Put your phone right here.

14:34.333 --> 14:36.433
-(radio chatter)

14:36.467 --> 14:38.067
-Listen to me, the reason
I'm stoppin' you

14:38.067 --> 14:41.133
is that license plate
on your vehicle doesn't belong
on that vehicle.

14:41.167 --> 14:42.633
-That's my girlfriend's vehicle.

14:42.667 --> 14:44.300
-That's your
girlfriend's vehicle?

14:44.333 --> 14:45.800
No weapons in the vehicle?
-No, sir.

14:45.833 --> 14:48.800
-Okay.
Hang tight for me.

14:48.833 --> 14:50.733
How y'all doin' today?
-All right.

14:50.767 --> 14:53.667
-You have IDs on you?
-Yeah, somewhere.

14:57.467 --> 14:59.767
-Listen,
put your hands on the roof.
Put your hands on the roof.

14:59.800 --> 15:02.967
Put your hands on the roof.
Ma'am! Put your hands
on the roof.

15:03.067 --> 15:04.300
-Oh! I'm sorry.
-Do it now.

15:04.333 --> 15:05.533
Is there a gun in this vehicle?

15:05.567 --> 15:08.067
-No.
-Keep-- on the roof.

15:08.067 --> 15:11.467
Back passenger, step out
of the vehicle.

15:11.500 --> 15:13.067
You have anything on you
I need to know about?

15:13.100 --> 15:15.733
-No, sir, no, no.
-Ma'am, keep your hands
on the roof.

15:15.767 --> 15:17.500
Hey, they got a--
uh, a gun magazine

15:17.533 --> 15:19.167
that was sittin'
on the driver's seat.

15:19.200 --> 15:21.133
So there's probably
gonna be a gun somewhere.

15:23.367 --> 15:25.567
I got it.
There's one, I don't know
if there's more.

15:29.600 --> 15:31.633
Step out.

15:31.667 --> 15:33.067
Open your mouth.

15:33.067 --> 15:35.200
It's just gum.

15:35.233 --> 15:36.500
-Turn around.

15:37.933 --> 15:39.633
Step to the back of the car.

15:40.900 --> 15:45.733
Got a-- gonna have
a Smith & Wesson 9mm.

15:45.767 --> 15:47.700
Probably that magazine
I put on top of the roof.

15:47.733 --> 15:49.233
-All right.
-Probably gonna
go to this,

15:49.267 --> 15:51.200
'cause it ain't
got a mag in it.

15:51.233 --> 15:52.400
Are you a convicted felon?

15:52.433 --> 15:54.600
-Yes, sir.
-Okay. Do you know
where the magazine

15:54.633 --> 15:56.167
for the gun was sittin'?
-No, sir.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.967
-Right on the driver's seat.
Right where you were sittin'.

15:59.067 --> 16:00.800
Okay?
-Sir, that was not mine.

16:00.833 --> 16:03.067
-I-- I'm just tellin' you
the facts right now.

16:03.067 --> 16:04.733
Okay?
I'm not askin' you
any questions,

16:04.767 --> 16:06.800
I'm just tellin' you
what's goin' on.

16:06.833 --> 16:08.800
So you can--
listen to me, you can
sit here and deny

16:08.833 --> 16:11.467
you had no knowledge
of it, you can say this, that
and the other,

16:11.500 --> 16:14.467
but when you're sittin'
on top of it, it's an issue.

16:14.500 --> 16:17.567
You on parole?
-No, I mean, I'm just
currently on probation

16:17.600 --> 16:19.400
right now.
-Probation for what?

16:19.433 --> 16:22.067
-Um, for a possession charge.

16:22.067 --> 16:24.767
-Possession of...?
-It was, uh, of meth.

16:24.800 --> 16:27.400
-Possession of meth?
-Do you have a problem
with me searchin' that vehicle?

16:27.433 --> 16:30.133
Am I gonna find any more
weapons or drugs
in that vehicle?

16:30.167 --> 16:32.267
-It's not my vehicle, sir.
-I'm-- That's not what
I'm askin' you.

16:32.300 --> 16:34.933
-I'm not giving consent
to anything, sir, 'cause
I don't even know what I would--

16:34.967 --> 16:37.333
-Right now you're under arrest,
and I am gonna search
the vehicle.

16:37.367 --> 16:40.233
I was just askin' you,
but I have the-- the legal right
to search the vehicle.

16:40.267 --> 16:41.567
-Why am I bein'
under arrest, sir?

16:41.600 --> 16:43.767
-Okay. Right now
you're under arrest--
listen to me--

16:43.800 --> 16:46.367
Right now you're under arrest
for possession of a firearm
by a convicted felon.

16:46.400 --> 16:47.800
-Sir, I did not have
any gun on me.

16:47.833 --> 16:49.833
-(radio chatter)
-Can you start workin'
on their information,

16:49.867 --> 16:52.667
run 'em?
I'm gonna finish up
a search of the car.

16:55.533 --> 16:57.900
There's several items
of, uh, drug paraphernalia.

16:57.933 --> 17:02.067
We got, uh, a used pipe
to smoke, uh, crystal meth
amphetamine.

17:02.067 --> 17:06.067
We have, uh, another pipe.
A butane torch, which is
what's used to heat up

17:06.067 --> 17:07.833
the methamphetamine,
to smoke it.

17:07.867 --> 17:10.733
Baggies.
Fuel, syringes.

17:10.767 --> 17:15.100
We also have, uh, an additional
magazine to a, uh, 9mm handgun,

17:17.333 --> 17:20.867
which, uh, most likely
gonna belong to the firearm
that we found earlier.

17:22.233 --> 17:24.367
Your name's Amy?
-Uh-huh.

17:24.400 --> 17:27.767
The firearm in the vehicle.
Who does that belong to?

17:27.800 --> 17:30.200
-I don't-- I don't--
I don't do guns.

17:30.233 --> 17:32.067
I don't--
-Is that your purse
right there?

17:32.100 --> 17:34.333
-Yeah.
-Okay. I have enough
to book you on.

17:34.367 --> 17:36.200
I-- I'm not gonna sit here
and lie to you.

17:36.233 --> 17:39.333
So if you wanna
tell the truth, but I'm giving
the opportunity for you

17:39.367 --> 17:41.267
to explain--
-It's not my gun.
It's really not my gun.

17:41.300 --> 17:43.200
It's not his
in the back seat, either.

17:43.233 --> 17:45.633
-Okay.
So you're tellin' me
it's for the driver.

17:45.667 --> 17:47.867
-Mm.
-There was a magazine,
a gun magazine

17:47.900 --> 17:49.467
for that gun
sittin' on the driver's seat

17:49.500 --> 17:50.700
right where he was sittin'.

17:50.733 --> 17:53.667
-Okay.
-Who is he to you, first off?

17:53.700 --> 17:56.167
-Boyfriend.
-So obviously you've seen him
with the gun before.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.067
If you live together,
you're drivin' the same vehicle.

17:58.067 --> 18:00.067
Is your vehicle registered
to you or him?

18:00.067 --> 18:02.567
-No, it's actually
from my ex.

18:02.600 --> 18:05.767
-So you're ridin'
with your new boyfriend
in your ex-boyfriend's vehicle?

18:05.800 --> 18:07.200
-Yes.
-Okay, you know
the license plate

18:07.233 --> 18:08.900
on the vehicle
doesn't match?
It's not for this vehicle?

18:08.933 --> 18:10.933
-(sighs)
-That's the reason
I'm stoppin' you

18:10.967 --> 18:12.500
in the first place.
-Wow.

18:12.533 --> 18:15.633
-Yeah.
How did the extra magazine
get in your ve--

18:15.667 --> 18:17.067
in your property?

18:17.100 --> 18:18.433
-No?

18:18.467 --> 18:20.867
I have--
-I can show you
what I'm talkin' about, too.

18:22.700 --> 18:27.600
Along with--
that's what was in the bag.

18:27.633 --> 18:28.833
-That's not my bag.

18:28.867 --> 18:30.167
-Okay.
Who's bag is this?

18:30.200 --> 18:31.900
It's not mine.
-What about the scales
and the pipes

18:31.933 --> 18:33.667
and everything?
Are you a meth user?

18:33.700 --> 18:35.367
-Yes, I am a drug addict.
-How long you been using?

18:35.400 --> 18:39.233
-Um... probably on and off
since I was 16.

18:39.267 --> 18:41.067
-All right.
Go stand by the back
of the car.

18:41.067 --> 18:42.900
I'll be back with you
and explain to you
what's goin' on.

18:46.133 --> 18:48.833
Okay.
Obviously, you got several
felony drug convictions,

18:48.867 --> 18:51.233
all right?
So right now, you're gonna
be charged with possession

18:51.267 --> 18:53.533
of a, uh, firearm
by a convicted felon, all right?

18:53.567 --> 18:55.933
-I was not
in possession of it, sir.
-Okay.

18:55.967 --> 18:57.067
-That was not my gun.

18:57.100 --> 18:58.467
-All the occupants
in the vehicle,

18:58.500 --> 19:00.500
they all seem to think
that you were pretty aware

19:00.533 --> 19:03.067
of that gun in the vehicle,
and they've seen you
with the gun before.

19:03.067 --> 19:04.867
-It's not my gun, sir,
and I wasn't drivin'
that vehicle.

19:04.900 --> 19:07.967
-Okay, do you wanna say
who's gun it is, if you're
claimin' it's not yours?

19:09.800 --> 19:12.633
Okay.
You're goin' down for--
The reason for the traffic stop,

19:12.667 --> 19:14.967
you may have not have been
aware of it, but you're
operatin' a vehicle

19:15.067 --> 19:16.400
with switched
license plate, okay?

19:16.433 --> 19:18.267
And, uh, your driver's license
is suspended.

19:18.300 --> 19:20.267
All right?
So right now, we're
about to get you down

19:20.300 --> 19:22.567
to the, uh, jail, downtown
Lafayette, the parish jail?

19:22.600 --> 19:24.400
And you'll be
able to use the phone
and everything else.

19:24.433 --> 19:25.633
Make contact
with your girlfriend.

19:25.667 --> 19:27.767
All right.
-(radio chatter)

19:27.800 --> 19:30.700
-Amy.
Hopefully you're gonna take this
as a learning experience.

19:30.733 --> 19:32.433
-Oh god, yes.

19:32.467 --> 19:36.167
-He's gonna be booked in
for the gun, for being
a convicted felon with a gun,

19:36.200 --> 19:39.233
uh... he's got
a suspended driver's license,
he's not supposed

19:39.267 --> 19:40.467
to be drivin'
in the first place.

19:40.500 --> 19:42.800
See how one thing
leads to another?
-Yeah. Yeah.

19:42.833 --> 19:44.900
-All from a switched plate.
All right?

19:44.933 --> 19:47.267
Give me a second,
I'll have you out of here
in just a minute, all right?

19:47.300 --> 19:48.333
-All right.
-All right.

19:49.433 --> 19:51.600
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:51.633 --> 19:53.567
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:53.600 --> 19:54.733
Cover is code three.

19:54.767 --> 19:57.733
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:04.267 --> 20:06.433
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:06.467 --> 20:09.467
