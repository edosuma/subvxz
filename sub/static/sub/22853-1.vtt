I'm just gonna drive her.

00:29.597 --> 00:32.232

Because he hired and fired you?

If she has urges, she won't act on them.

21:45.472 --> 21:46.839
Everybody move.

21:46.873 --> 21:49.041
-Hey, you a mess, boy.
-Give me your hand.

21:51.578 --> 21:53.680
Watch out.

21:55.782 --> 21:57.550
What you got?

21:57.584 --> 21:58.585
Nothing.

22:01.020 --> 22:04.624
Hmm. All right.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.793
Well, let's just roll on out then.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.495
Come on.

22:13.065 --> 22:14.667
Let's go.

22:24.744 --> 22:27.880
Please, Daniel, get that out of here.

22:27.914 --> 22:29.749
What are the prints?

22:29.782 --> 22:32.452
One is the deceased, Oliver Mendia.

22:32.485 --> 22:35.455
The other belongs to a California resident who was arrested

22:35.488 --> 22:37.156
for drunk driving six years ago,

22:37.189 --> 22:39.125
Jeremiah Rose.

22:39.158 --> 22:42.729
And, you know, I found what I thought was blood,

22:42.762 --> 22:45.832
but I couldn't find a match.

22:45.865 --> 22:48.635
I couldn't even find a type.

22:48.668 --> 22:50.169
I don't know what else it could be.

22:50.202 --> 22:54.507
Ange, I need a big solid.

22:55.975 --> 22:57.143
Keep those prints on Rose

22:57.176 --> 23:00.880
between us until I tell you, cool?

23:26.138 --> 23:27.774
[Knocking]

23:27.807 --> 23:28.908
Arnie.

23:44.223 --> 23:45.692
We're closed.

23:45.725 --> 23:48.928
Dude, come on, man.
I need your help.

23:51.197 --> 23:52.832
Arnie, don't answer the door, don't pick up the phone,

23:52.865 --> 23:54.166
don't talk to anyone.

23:54.200 --> 23:56.002
[Arnie] man, I mean, look at this chick.

23:56.035 --> 23:57.604
You ain't cut out for this.

23:57.637 --> 23:59.205
Look, I know there's trouble in this.

24:06.078 --> 24:08.515
Jesus Christ.

24:08.548 --> 24:10.082
Come on.

24:12.118 --> 24:15.588
If people are gonna chase you, she's gotta be fast.

25:00.232 --> 25:02.101
[Phone ringing]

25:02.134 --> 25:03.235
[Growling]

25:03.269 --> 25:09.041
[Ringing continues]

25:09.075 --> 25:12.845
What the hell are you doing?

25:12.879 --> 25:17.116
[Arnie]
Jerr, what's up? Jerr.

25:17.149 --> 25:18.851
Oliver and Max are dead.

25:20.920 --> 25:22.655
[Arnie] 
Listen, whoever these people are,

25:22.689 --> 25:23.856
Are you listening to me?

25:23.890 --> 25:26.058
You gotta get out of your place.

25:26.092 --> 25:28.060
-[Arnie] you have to give her up.
-No, you listen to me.

25:28.094 --> 25:30.830
The guy who killed them is on his way to you.

25:30.863 --> 25:33.633
[Arnie]
Jeremiah, what the fuck have you done?

25:33.666 --> 25:36.636
I'm sorry.

25:38.805 --> 25:40.773
Please get her somewhere safe.

25:40.807 --> 25:43.643
[Arnie]
I'm gonna take her to my cabin, the place I told you about.

25:43.676 --> 25:44.844
Nobody'll find her there.

25:44.877 --> 25:48.114
-Arnie.
-Yeah?

25:48.147 --> 25:49.148
You got a gun?

25:49.181 --> 25:51.618
Yeah, I have a gun.

25:52.619 --> 25:54.754
I'm gonna need it.

27:01.220 --> 27:03.255
Jeremiah.

27:03.289 --> 27:05.792
You know, killing's a funny thing.

27:08.227 --> 27:09.962
Most people stay dead.

27:17.403 --> 27:22.341
Your best chance is to bring her back.

27:22.374 --> 27:27.213
If you do that, I'll give you 50-50.

27:29.481 --> 27:34.153
If you don't, what happens is 100%.

27:35.888 --> 27:40.059
You have until the end of tomorrow night.

27:43.462 --> 27:45.798
But if you overrun that,

27:45.832 --> 27:50.737
or anything happens to that girl,

27:50.770 --> 27:54.106
you'll find my word is gold.

28:01.914 --> 28:03.850
[Arnie]
Jeremiah, we're on our way.

28:03.883 --> 28:05.384
Yeah, the cabin's not easy to find.

28:05.417 --> 28:07.353
I'll text you the turn-off.
Gotta go.

28:07.386 --> 28:08.821
Stop the car.

28:08.855 --> 28:10.322
We're two miles from the next rest stop.

28:10.356 --> 28:13.826
Stop the car.

28:13.860 --> 28:15.361
We're in the middle of the road.

28:15.394 --> 28:17.329
-[Demonic voice] Stop the car!
-What the fuck?

28:20.532 --> 28:22.301
[Car horn honking]

28:36.448 --> 28:38.217
I need your blood.

28:38.250 --> 28:40.052
Please, please, don't be afraid.

28:40.086 --> 28:42.454
I'm not gonna hurt you.

28:42.488 --> 28:45.291
You're not going to take my blood.

28:45.324 --> 28:47.459
Just one... you're in the middle of the road!

28:53.465 --> 28:56.402
[Horn honking]

30:23.555 --> 30:27.526
You were supposed to find the ones that took her,

30:27.559 --> 30:29.896
kill them, and bring her back.

30:29.929 --> 30:31.864
I gave the driver until the end of tomorrow night.

30:31.898 --> 30:34.433
That's not what I wanted.

30:34.466 --> 30:36.202
I never break my word.

30:37.603 --> 30:39.605
[Gasps]

30:43.242 --> 30:47.046
You see, you had your chance.

30:47.079 --> 30:48.047
Stay out of it now.

30:48.080 --> 30:49.415
I can't do that.

30:49.448 --> 30:51.517
-I want you...
-[gasping]

30:51.550 --> 30:53.419
to see something.

30:53.452 --> 30:56.322
I'm not answerable just to you.

30:56.355 --> 30:57.489
Not anymore.

30:57.523 --> 31:01.994
Every breath you draw,

31:02.028 --> 31:04.596
you owe to me.

31:04.630 --> 31:08.000
If you're threatening me with that girl,

31:08.034 --> 31:11.303
she means nothing to me.

32:41.127 --> 32:43.129
Jerr, what the fuck is going on?

32:47.766 --> 32:49.301
Is Anna safe?

32:50.769 --> 32:52.471
She's safe.

32:55.674 --> 32:57.476
I need 24 hours.

33:01.213 --> 33:02.481
Is it a girl?

33:14.693 --> 33:16.462
I need 24 hours.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.735
In 24 hours it won't be up to me.

34:07.646 --> 34:09.481
Where's Arnie?

34:16.388 --> 34:19.324
You can't be alone out here like that.

34:24.730 --> 34:27.498
What happened to your face?

34:32.504 --> 34:34.572
You're healed.

34:45.751 --> 34:49.221
Thank you for saving my life.

34:49.255 --> 34:52.190
You're the only person I can trust now.

35:07.206 --> 35:09.208
You won't be needing this.

35:43.542 --> 35:45.544
[Gasping]

37:32.083 --> 37:33.852
Just let me go.

37:36.021 --> 37:37.356
You know I can't do that.

37:39.325 --> 37:40.659
Kill him.

37:40.692 --> 37:43.495
I want to take it back.

37:43.529 --> 37:45.697
Whatever it is, this thing I'm becoming?

37:45.731 --> 37:47.933
I'd rather die.

37:51.437 --> 37:53.839
I will not kill him.

37:55.607 --> 37:57.309
Is that what you really want?

38:00.045 --> 38:05.751
Because if it is, you won't be able to do it yourself.

38:05.784 --> 38:10.556
Your insides, they won't let you.

38:10.589 --> 38:11.590
Let him do it.

38:13.492 --> 38:17.796
If you want a real death,

38:17.829 --> 38:21.633
he can give it to you.

38:22.968 --> 38:24.436
I don't understand.

38:24.470 --> 38:27.005
Everything I've promised you is real.

38:27.038 --> 38:28.774
This is the opposite of life.

38:28.807 --> 38:29.841
Don't!

38:33.812 --> 38:35.614
I felt his heart.

38:35.647 --> 38:36.948
You know what you have to do.

38:36.982 --> 38:40.118
Come daybreak tomorrow, none of it will matter.

38:40.151 --> 38:41.887
You said when the time came, I would have a choice.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.755
-He's dead already!
-[Thunder]

38:43.789 --> 38:46.458
By asking for his help, you chose that.

38:46.492 --> 38:47.793
And the longer you are with him,

38:47.826 --> 38:50.862
the more the urge will take over.

38:57.469 --> 38:59.771
Did you think there were no consequences?

39:03.475 --> 39:06.478
You see, whatever...

39:06.512 --> 39:10.482
life or death...

39:10.516 --> 39:12.984
that you choose,

39:13.018 --> 39:15.020
there are always consequences.

40:09.741 --> 40:11.176
Where'd you go?

40:13.745 --> 40:15.413
I'm sorry.

40:20.586 --> 40:22.488
For what?

40:30.896 --> 40:32.531
I have something to confess.

40:35.634 --> 40:36.935
What is it?

40:36.968 --> 40:40.572
I went to your place yesterday,

40:40.606 --> 40:43.775
because I wasn't...

40:43.809 --> 40:46.478
I wasn't sure.

40:49.080 --> 40:51.650
Then I found this.

40:55.621 --> 40:58.223
See? It's monogrammed.

40:58.256 --> 41:01.893
My dad gave it to me when I was young.

41:03.562 --> 41:06.464
I got this crazy idea...

41:10.969 --> 41:13.772
that maybe you took this from me

41:13.805 --> 41:17.108
because, you know,

41:17.142 --> 41:18.977
you had feelings for me.

41:22.881 --> 41:24.783
This was something to hold onto

41:24.816 --> 41:26.752
Because we couldn't be together.

41:32.791 --> 41:34.225
I'm not that sentimental.

Hey. Got gas and picked up some food.

43:22.067 --> 43:24.069
We should keep moving.

43:33.712 --> 43:34.880
Take this from me.

43:39.084 --> 43:40.351
What are you doing?

43:57.135 --> 43:59.905
Give me your hand.

44:03.041 --> 44:05.877
Don't be afraid.

44:06.945 --> 44:08.246
I'm not.

44:44.082 --> 44:46.351
You have to kill me.

44:48.854 --> 44:51.156
If the baby has R.H. Positive blood

44:51.189 --> 44:53.324
inherited from the father

44:53.358 --> 44:57.462
and the mother and baby's blood cells

44:57.495 --> 45:00.966
become mixed during gestation,

45:00.999 --> 45:04.335
the mother's body may treat the baby's blood cells

45:04.369 --> 45:06.137
as foreign substances

45:06.171 --> 45:08.840
and produce, um,

45:08.874 --> 45:11.342
antibodies against them.

45:11.376 --> 45:13.845
As a result of this,

45:13.879 --> 45:17.482
the baby may be born seriously ill,

45:17.515 --> 45:22.788
and unless there's a blood transfusion right after birth,

45:22.821 --> 45:24.856
the baby could die.

45:26.424 --> 45:28.359
I don't understand.

45:28.393 --> 45:30.862
Are you saying that my blood is no good?

46:36.127 --> 46:38.163
We should have brought the blade.

46:38.196 --> 46:39.965
That'd be like accepting defeat.

46:48.106 --> 46:50.808
The light's awesome when it's dying.

46:54.612 --> 46:58.149
It's one of the few times I think maybe there is a god.

47:00.385 --> 47:02.287
I hope there is.

47:07.225 --> 47:09.327
Ballistics report came back today.

47:14.332 --> 47:16.167
Car accident or something.

47:19.370 --> 47:21.873
That's a nice tattoo.

47:30.148 --> 47:32.183
Seems like all your boys is dying today.

47:33.952 --> 47:36.154
And this one right here don't even look like a flip.

47:39.690 --> 47:44.329
You know, I figured that it's tough on all of us

47:44.362 --> 47:49.167
with all this lawlessness we got to deal with every day.

47:49.200 --> 47:52.337
So I really don't like questioning other badges,

47:52.370 --> 47:54.505
but I got to tell you,

47:54.539 --> 47:56.574
I'm having a hard time shaking this feeling

47:56.607 --> 48:00.011
that you... you're hiding something from me.

48:00.045 --> 48:03.448
All them boys dead got to have something to do with somebody in common.

48:05.050 --> 48:07.418
And I think it's somebody you know.

48:18.063 --> 48:23.701
I think the symbol of sacrifice is quite beautiful.

48:23.734 --> 48:26.537
-Don't you?
-If you say so.

48:29.374 --> 48:32.577
You're employer's grown Morose.

48:32.610 --> 48:34.379
We thought he would be a fine person

48:34.412 --> 48:38.216
to begin a West Covina chapter.

48:38.249 --> 48:44.055
But this whole incident has become messier than need be.

48:44.089 --> 48:48.093
And now you claim he doesn't want you to kill the driver?

48:48.126 --> 48:51.929
That is what you said, isn't it?

48:56.367 --> 48:59.237
I miss the days when we could all do our own killings.

48:59.270 --> 49:01.372
Vampires didn't need men like you.

49:01.406 --> 49:06.511
It was very libertarian.

49:06.544 --> 49:09.714
You mentioned something about a lead.

49:09.747 --> 49:12.350
If the girl has changed her mind,

49:12.383 --> 49:15.386
there is this woman they might see.

49:19.757 --> 49:22.393
I knew you'd come.

49:26.064 --> 49:29.067
I never wanted this.

49:29.100 --> 49:33.471
I can see you actually thought about killing him.

49:36.174 --> 49:38.043
Did she show you the blade?

49:39.644 --> 49:42.647
He didn't want to bring the blade.

49:42.680 --> 49:46.117
That blade is the only thing that will stop her

49:46.151 --> 49:47.652
if she wanted to kill you.

49:54.225 --> 49:56.394
You haven't got much time.

49:56.427 --> 49:58.329
When did it happen?

50:00.498 --> 50:03.134
Six nights ago.

50:03.168 --> 50:05.136
The seventh is your last.

50:05.170 --> 50:09.707
If you don't die, you will kill,

50:09.740 --> 50:12.343
and he won't be able to stop you.

50:16.681 --> 50:20.151
Do you still want to help me?

50:20.185 --> 50:23.321
Jeremiah, you have to kill Roman.

50:23.354 --> 50:26.057
And if you do... if...

50:26.091 --> 50:28.059
mix a drop of his blood

50:28.093 --> 50:31.329
in this vial of newly blessed holy water.

50:31.362 --> 50:36.301
Drink it and you'll be human again, Crystal.

50:36.334 --> 50:37.768
Remember, the blessing has to be fresh.

50:37.802 --> 50:39.670
The water that you use at church,

50:39.704 --> 50:43.241
once everyone's touched it,

50:43.274 --> 50:45.176
that's not holy water anymore.

50:45.210 --> 50:46.511
This is bullshit.

50:46.544 --> 50:47.712
She doesn't know what she's talking about.

50:47.745 --> 50:51.616
Listen, it has to be father Mena.

50:51.649 --> 50:54.352
You can't just explain all this to any priest in the middle of the night.

50:54.385 --> 50:58.223
Jeremiah, we have to go back and get the blade.

50:58.256 --> 50:59.390
All the rest of this is bullshit.

50:59.424 --> 51:01.459
I want to believe you.

51:01.492 --> 51:03.060
You have to kill me...

51:05.563 --> 51:08.699
-Before I kill you.
-I'll prove it to you.

51:08.733 --> 51:12.637
Emily! Come out here, sweetheart.

51:15.340 --> 51:18.676
Tonight was her last night, too.

51:18.709 --> 51:22.680
She's just like you, Crystal.

51:22.713 --> 51:26.817
Little Emily didn't deserve this.

51:26.851 --> 51:29.720
I infected her.

51:29.754 --> 51:32.490
I wanted the child I never had.

51:33.891 --> 51:39.464
And now, I have to kill her

51:39.497 --> 51:42.600
before the sickness I gave her destroys her.

51:45.603 --> 51:49.474
But I hoped you'd come, and I saw father Mena today

51:49.507 --> 51:51.876
and had some water blessed myself.

51:53.244 --> 51:57.682
This blade belongs to me.
Kill me.

51:57.715 --> 51:59.650
-No!
-And then you'll believe.

51:59.684 --> 52:04.189
-No!
-Jeremiah, please.

52:08.326 --> 52:10.861
Help me free her.

52:10.895 --> 52:14.165
You don't kill us in the heart

52:14.199 --> 52:15.600
Like all the stories say.

52:16.834 --> 52:19.237
You kill us in the throat.

52:23.874 --> 52:27.445
-Do it.
-Show me how strong you are, Jeremiah.

52:27.478 --> 52:29.847
Roman is much stronger than me.

52:36.321 --> 52:37.322
Do it!

[Psychic]
There you go.

52:51.769 --> 52:55.873
Aah! Aah!

54:18.489 --> 54:21.025
You were never a believer.

54:21.058 --> 54:23.428
But now in your time of desperation...

55:34.565 --> 55:37.602
before you take this,

55:37.635 --> 55:39.504
in your heart, do you believe?

55:41.472 --> 55:42.840
Father, there's no time.

55:42.873 --> 55:44.509
[Gunfire]

56:21.078 --> 56:22.547
Are you shot?

56:22.580 --> 56:25.516
I have a small cut from the altar.

56:27.652 --> 56:29.987
Oh, son, that doesn't look good.

56:32.557 --> 56:35.560
You know I could end this right now.

56:35.593 --> 56:38.195
-Are you hit?
-Father...

56:38.228 --> 56:39.764
Yes.

56:41.031 --> 56:44.034
-Are you?
-I told you not to run.

56:44.068 --> 56:47.538
Her fate is inevitable.

56:48.739 --> 56:51.642
Yours, you can change.

56:53.478 --> 56:56.647
-I don't believe in fate.
-Do you believe in god?

57:32.650 --> 57:35.119
[Whimpering]

58:52.897 --> 58:54.865
We have to go.

59:01.105 --> 59:04.208
You have to go to a hospital.

59:04.241 --> 59:06.844
You don't have much time.

59:06.877 --> 59:09.780
You might die.

59:09.814 --> 59:14.218
If we don't make it and I'm anywhere near you,

59:14.251 --> 59:17.955
you will probably kill me anyway.

59:34.739 --> 59:37.574
Detective, this little girl says she's looking for you.

59:40.678 --> 59:43.380
How old are you?

59:43.413 --> 59:45.816
I'm not sure.

59:45.850 --> 59:47.184
How'd you get here?

59:56.260 --> 59:58.162
[Coughing]

01:00:35.966 --> 01:00:38.769
I'm not going to hurt you.

01:00:38.803 --> 01:00:41.672
Do you know how long I've waited for you?

01:00:41.706 --> 01:00:46.010
What you've done?
It's immoral.

01:00:46.043 --> 01:00:48.312
The whole world is immoral.

01:00:50.314 --> 01:00:53.183
The people who lecture you are hypocrites.

01:00:53.217 --> 01:00:57.387
The honest ones wallow in their own despair.

01:00:59.289 --> 01:01:02.659
He was going to take me back.

01:01:04.394 --> 01:01:06.130
Help him.

01:01:14.171 --> 01:01:18.075
-Do one thing and I will.
-Anything.

01:01:21.378 --> 01:01:23.814
[Roman]
Take his blood.
Know what you can be.

01:01:23.848 --> 01:01:27.251
If you do that, I will save him.

01:01:28.786 --> 01:01:34.358
Crystal, what you do with him after,

01:01:34.391 --> 01:01:36.693
I leave to you.

01:02:55.405 --> 01:02:58.575
You wanna tell me what the hell is going on?

01:02:58.608 --> 01:03:02.512
This little girl has been missing damn near a week now.

01:03:02.546 --> 01:03:05.916
And her folks that was on the news, we can't find them either.

01:03:05.950 --> 01:03:09.186
Now, child services is here to take her.

01:03:09.219 --> 01:03:11.521
And she said somebody that you know

01:03:11.555 --> 01:03:13.824
told her to come here looking for you.

01:03:13.858 --> 01:03:16.560
Now you wanna tell me who that friend is?

01:05:39.003 --> 01:05:41.371
Am I dead?

01:05:47.244 --> 01:05:48.445
Roman saved you.

01:05:48.478 --> 01:05:53.017
God, you're beautiful.

01:05:55.185 --> 01:05:56.987
How do you feel?

01:06:01.525 --> 01:06:05.195
I feel amazing.

01:06:13.503 --> 01:06:17.507
I do, too.
I feel strong.

01:06:19.476 --> 01:06:23.113
I feel like I could do anything.

01:06:27.217 --> 01:06:29.653
Are you hungry?

01:06:37.761 --> 01:06:40.097
This is my parent's house.

01:06:42.832 --> 01:06:45.202
Why do work in that place then?

01:06:49.606 --> 01:06:52.242
Where are they now?

01:06:55.479 --> 01:06:57.147
They're dead.

01:07:07.157 --> 01:07:09.759
You see this dress?

01:07:09.793 --> 01:07:11.595
My mom had actually put in her will

01:07:11.628 --> 01:07:16.533
that she wanted to be buried in this.

01:07:21.538 --> 01:07:24.208
Why wasn't she?

01:07:29.713 --> 01:07:32.382
Their bodies burned in a fire.

01:07:49.233 --> 01:07:51.067
I don't wanna die.

01:08:57.701 --> 01:09:00.270
What are you doing at my desk, Hobbs?

01:09:00.304 --> 01:09:03.573
I'm just sitting here thinking about that little girl.

01:09:03.607 --> 01:09:05.908
You still have that address to the strip club?

01:09:05.942 --> 01:09:08.912
Yes, siree, I do.

01:09:14.484 --> 01:09:16.553
All of a sudden, you wanna be a cop now.

01:09:17.587 --> 01:09:20.357
Hm. That's funny.

01:09:21.491 --> 01:09:23.493
You know what?
Fuck you, man.

01:09:39.843 --> 01:09:42.312
-I still don't trust Bill.
-I don't either,

01:09:42.345 --> 01:09:43.712
but it's gonna be daylight soon.

01:09:43.747 --> 01:09:45.814
I don't feel any changes in me.

01:09:45.849 --> 01:09:47.317
Maybe the psychic was wrong.

01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:48.818
Maybe there is no ticking clock.

01:09:48.852 --> 01:09:50.754
We're going in through the back way.

01:09:58.262 --> 01:10:00.730
This was an unnecessary mess...

01:10:02.031 --> 01:10:06.370
but I took an oath never to harm him.

01:10:08.004 --> 01:10:10.540
You'll need this.

01:10:10.574 --> 01:10:12.542
Manningham says it's the one.

01:10:13.543 --> 01:10:15.845
I can't vouch for that.

01:10:15.879 --> 01:10:19.683
But if you choose to take the risk,

01:10:19.716 --> 01:10:21.651
that's what he told me.

01:10:21.685 --> 01:10:23.487
The way I see it, you don't have much choice.

01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:28.425
-Who's Manningham?
-Take the blade.

01:10:28.458 --> 01:10:29.926
Just take it.

01:10:46.676 --> 01:10:49.813
Remember what I told you, Jeremiah.

01:10:49.846 --> 01:10:53.383
I always keep my word.

01:10:53.417 --> 01:10:54.551
You understand.

01:11:07.431 --> 01:11:09.666
Maybe I should run right now.

01:11:09.699 --> 01:11:11.868
Get away from you just to be safe

01:11:11.901 --> 01:11:14.371
and see what happens.

01:11:14.404 --> 01:11:17.040
Maybe nothing happens.

01:11:17.073 --> 01:11:19.576
Look, something is different.

01:11:19.609 --> 01:11:21.044
I should be sick, but I'm not...

01:11:21.077 --> 01:11:25.081
Why did Roman save me?

01:11:25.114 --> 01:11:27.317
Must have been something you promised.

01:11:34.458 --> 01:11:36.560
I should go somewhere now.

01:11:38.562 --> 01:11:41.431
-Somewhere where?
-Somewhere.

01:11:43.099 --> 01:11:46.970
If things turn out right,

01:11:47.003 --> 01:11:49.806
that's where you'll find me.

01:11:51.808 --> 01:11:55.345
That's kind of like a promise, right?

01:12:30.113 --> 01:12:31.881
What are you doing?

01:12:31.915 --> 01:12:34.117
Go back to sleep.

01:12:35.519 --> 01:12:38.121

Someplace I shouldn't.

01:12:47.964 --> 01:12:51.167
-Then don't go.
-I have to.

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:53.937
You don't have to do anything.

01:12:53.970 --> 01:12:59.042
-I have to do something.
-About what?

01:13:00.844 --> 01:13:03.847
The things that are going on out there.

01:13:11.054 --> 01:13:13.523
If I come back from tonight, we should try again.

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:19.128
The doctor said blood treatments could work.

01:13:19.162 --> 01:13:22.131
Maybe we're not supposed to have a child.

01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:27.003
Wait, what do you mean, if you make it back?

01:13:27.036 --> 01:13:29.673
I have to go.

01:13:59.769 --> 01:14:02.205

01:14:02.238 --> 01:14:06.710
Mr. Manningham, why are you here?

01:14:09.946 --> 01:14:12.181
She'll be coming back.

01:14:14.618 --> 01:14:16.452
But she won't come back to you.

01:14:18.254 --> 01:14:20.757
She'll come to kill you.

01:14:23.693 --> 01:14:26.229
She's bringing the driver.

01:14:26.262 --> 01:14:27.997
They spoke with the psychic.

01:14:28.031 --> 01:14:32.001
I think they know the steps.

01:14:34.538 --> 01:14:37.941
I never liked that psychic.

01:14:37.974 --> 01:14:39.743
