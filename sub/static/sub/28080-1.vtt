09:24.189 --> 09:25.148
For you.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.984
Yeah, what about how
there's always, like, some main chick,

09:28.068 --> 09:29.319
and she's super clumsy.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.154
She's always like... "Oh! Whoops!"

09:31.237 --> 09:33.865
And everyone goes, "She's so charming."

09:33.948 --> 09:37.994
No. In real life, people'd think
she had muscular dystrophy.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.913
Your flaws are what make you beautiful.

09:39.996 --> 09:43.666
Uh, your flaws are what make you ugly.
That's why they're called flaws.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.376
And then, like, in those movies,

09:45.460 --> 09:47.295
when there are two women
in the same workplace,

09:47.378 --> 09:48.922
they have to be, like, mortal enemies.

09:49.005 --> 09:51.382
Look at us. Like, I love you,
I think you're the best.

09:52.008 --> 09:54.844
The idea that two women
can't root for each other at work

09:54.928 --> 09:55.929
is just disgusting.

09:56.554 --> 10:00.850
And apparently, there's no HR at any
of those businesses in rom-com world,

10:00.934 --> 10:02.977
because there's no diversity,

10:03.061 --> 10:05.605
and people are always
boning their co-workers.

10:05.688 --> 10:08.817
Oh, and don't even get me started
about the cliché gay best friend

10:08.900 --> 10:12.821
whose sole purpose in the story
is just to help the main hot chick.

10:12.904 --> 10:14.531
And, like, does he have a job?

10:14.614 --> 10:17.450
Like, what's going on in his life?
Who cares?

10:17.534 --> 10:19.577
It's so insulting, don't you think?

10:19.661 --> 10:22.163
And then they always have
some stupid voiceover

10:22.247 --> 10:24.499
that comes on to tell you
what you're supposed to think.

10:24.582 --> 10:26.668

What about how,
at the end of those rom-coms,

10:35.343 --> 10:38.721
they always do this stupid, like,

Well, guess what?

10:45.812 --> 10:47.313
He doesn't love you.

10:47.397 --> 10:49.691
That's why he's not currently with you

He does love you,
and he's there to complete you.

that romantic comedies are bad.

21:52.019 --> 21:55.439
[camply] With the key you gave me,
'cause I'm your favorite neighbor.

21:55.523 --> 21:56.690
Why are you talking like that?

21:56.774 --> 21:58.609
Erm, talking like what?

21:58.692 --> 22:00.444
Like an offensive version of a gay guy.

22:00.528 --> 22:03.113
[gasps] Miss Girl Thing Bouffant, please.

22:03.197 --> 22:04.782

22:11.622 --> 22:13.749
-What presentation?
-Um, I don't know.

22:13.833 --> 22:14.917
The big presentation.

Okay, booch,

Oh, uh, I wasn't fully done with that...

23:06.969 --> 23:09.638
Hey, Natalie, your 3D printer
was running a little bit slow,

23:09.722 --> 23:11.765
so I had IT come by

23:11.849 --> 23:13.017
Just preventative maintenance.

I don't have to explain shit to you.
I don't work for you.

Actually, you're my assistant, so...

23:35.998 --> 23:37.499

-Me working for you.

Okay, I really need your help.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.246
What's goin' on?

24:16.330 --> 24:17.790
I got mugged last night.

24:17.873 --> 24:19.541
And suddenly, my apartment is tits,

24:19.625 --> 24:22.753
and my neighbor Donny is setting
gay rights back, like, a hundred years.

24:22.836 --> 24:24.880
And Whitney is giving me
resting murder face.

24:24.964 --> 24:26.006
Nat, are you okay?

24:26.090 --> 24:29.760
No, my dog is now clean
and guys look at me in the eyes.

24:30.928 --> 24:32.805
-See?
-[chuckles] Hey, guys.

24:33.597 --> 24:35.307
I think that's a good thing though, right?

24:35.391 --> 24:38.519
Uh... Maybe in theory, but this is
some kind of parallel universe.

24:38.978 --> 24:40.396
This isn't our office.

24:40.813 --> 24:41.897
Josh, it's not.

24:41.981 --> 24:43.482
Look, it's not real.

24:43.565 --> 24:45.317
I think I might be going crazy.

24:45.442 --> 24:48.487
Hey, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Come on.

24:48.570 --> 24:49.697

24:52.616 --> 24:53.826
Hey, it's okay.

24:53.909 --> 24:57.037
You... [chuckles] You're a lot of things,
but you are not crazy.

24:57.121 --> 24:58.122
So...

24:58.205 --> 24:59.623
So you see it, too.

25:00.082 --> 25:02.668
Oh! Yeah, thank God.

25:02.751 --> 25:05.337
I think we should get out of here
before they bite us

25:05.421 --> 25:07.923
-or impregnate us--
-Okay, yeah. Let's get you some air.

25:08.007 --> 25:09.717
No one's gonna impregnate us. Come on.

Doesn't this all feel really weird?

25:14.138 --> 25:16.932
Okay, you have to calm down, okay?

25:24.773 --> 25:26.984
Okay, you're still looking at me

25:27.735 --> 25:30.446
Please, just don't commit me
to some super beautiful insane asylum.

25:30.529 --> 25:31.989
I don't think you're crazy.

25:32.406 --> 25:34.116
But what you were telling me is...

25:34.742 --> 25:36.368
a little cuckoo.

25:36.785 --> 25:39.079
But since you are the one saying it,
I believe you.

25:39.163 --> 25:40.581
-I'll help you, okay?
-Okay.

25:40.664 --> 25:41.790
Let's figure this out.

25:42.332 --> 25:44.793
All right, well, maybe if I retrace
my steps

You saved my life.

I can't thank you enough.

That is such a beautiful name.

Josssssh.

26:31.340 --> 26:34.009
I like how you say it. Josh! [chuckles]

26:34.093 --> 26:36.095
I don't know.
I think it's kinda... ordinary.

26:36.178 --> 26:37.054
No.

26:37.137 --> 26:38.847
I love ordinary.

26:38.931 --> 26:39.807
-You do?
-Yes.

26:39.890 --> 26:42.017
Okay, well, I am a very ordinary guy.

26:42.101 --> 26:44.269
I am a seven across the board.

26:44.353 --> 26:45.687
That's perfect.

26:45.771 --> 26:47.189
Oh, so...

26:48.482 --> 26:51.193
What do you do?
That's a thing an ordinary guy would ask.

26:51.276 --> 26:52.653
I'm a yoga ambassador.

26:53.362 --> 26:54.363
Namaste.

26:54.446 --> 26:55.280
Namaste. [laughs]

26:55.823 --> 26:58.033
But my real job is...
I'm a swimsuit model.

26:58.117 --> 27:01.120
-That makes sense.
-But really, I'm a role model.

27:01.203 --> 27:03.831
Because I believe in giving back
to the underprivileged.

27:03.914 --> 27:05.207
I'm underprivileged.

27:05.290 --> 27:07.751

Good to meet you. Um, I... I...

27:23.934 --> 27:26.436
I don't...
I can't believe I'm gonna do this, but...

27:27.312 --> 27:29.731
Would a man like you ever...

27:29.815 --> 27:31.775
have a drink with a girl like me?

27:34.653 --> 27:36.029
Oh, let me think about it.

27:37.698 --> 27:39.700
Yes. I will meet you back at the office.

has now become my mortal enemy.

29:26.181 --> 29:29.851

-What? No!
-Yeah, like that.

-Ugh!

41:55.722 --> 41:57.140
Good morning, beautiful.

41:57.223 --> 41:58.891
Last night was amazing.

41:58.975 --> 42:01.185

it's like I'm seeing it
for the first time.

42:06.065 --> 42:08.901
If I can't have sex, I'm at least
taking this nice purse with me.

42:09.986 --> 42:11.821
This little koala thing,
it looks expensive.

42:12.030 --> 42:14.115
Yeah, all right, give it to me.

42:15.158 --> 42:16.117
Natalie...

42:17.535 --> 42:18.703
I love you.

42:22.790 --> 42:24.709
Er... Can you just say that one more time?

42:24.792 --> 42:25.877
-What?
-Er...

42:25.960 --> 42:27.837
[chuckles] You know how us girls are.

42:28.379 --> 42:31.299
We love hearin' it.
Just say it. Say it again.

Well, check you out.

before the big presentation.

43:03.831 --> 43:06.334
This seems incredibly unnecessary, okay?

43:06.417 --> 43:09.587
Just 'cause we're two female colleagues,
we don't automatically have to be enemies.

43:09.670 --> 43:11.339
We marched together, remember?

43:11.422 --> 43:15.301
We had that great sign. Girls Just Wanna
Have Fun-damental Human Rights.

43:16.594 --> 43:17.512
Whitney?

43:18.346 --> 43:20.765
Whitney, what are you doing?
We're friends.

43:20.848 --> 43:23.017
Whitney, come on, we shared a T-shirt.

43:23.101 --> 43:26.062
And I stretched it out and you said,
"You can have that one now."

43:26.145 --> 43:27.355
I was like, "Score."

43:32.568 --> 43:34.362
Natalie, we're so glad you're here.

43:35.404 --> 43:37.240
-Oh.
-So, we have three days

43:37.323 --> 43:38.658
before the presentation.

43:38.741 --> 43:40.868
Give us your big idea for the hotel.

43:40.952 --> 43:43.871
But I... I... I don't, erm...
design the whole hotels.

43:43.955 --> 43:46.040
I normally, erm,
just do the parking garages.

[chuckles] You're our star architect,
come on.

43:48.751 --> 43:49.669

43:56.676 --> 43:57.844
It's a surprise.

43:57.927 --> 43:58.803
Yeah.

43:58.886 --> 44:01.264
And you're saving the best

44:01.347 --> 44:03.474

So, figured you're probably workin'
so hard you forgot to eat.

44:44.724 --> 44:46.809
I got us a little Mister Wongs.

-Uh-huh.

Erm...

45:02.909 --> 45:04.160
I just kind of ran with it.

45:04.243 --> 45:06.329
Nat, this is so like you.

45:06.412 --> 45:09.498
Hm... To waste so much time
on a dumb idea.

45:10.708 --> 45:11.834
No.

45:11.918 --> 45:15.755
No, to come up with, like, the best,
most original idea, just like that.

45:15.838 --> 45:17.632
Clearly, you don't need my help,

he's the one that makes the decision.

Ah.

47:22.506 --> 47:23.382
He seems sweet.

Someone should tell him not to wear
a brown belt with black shoes, though.

[Natalie] Erm... Yes.

47:45.654 --> 47:47.907
[Blake] He once said that true happiness

47:47.990 --> 47:51.744
was when what you think,
what you say, and what you do

47:51.827 --> 47:53.245
are in perfect harmony.

47:53.704 --> 47:55.164

all these sayings by heart, Blake.

-You didn't tell me

was Nat's assistant.

-Architect.

I called him Mush?

that thing that I love, when you do.

-[Josh] Uh...
-Come on. Do it.

48:37.248 --> 48:39.208
-Maybe not right now.
-Do it. Do it, do it!

48:39.291 --> 48:40.167
Okay. [grunts]

-Oh, Blake and I?
-Uh, let me guess.

48:52.680 --> 48:55.516
You guys met at some fabulous yacht party.

48:55.599 --> 48:56.851

48:56.934 --> 48:59.103
Actually, it was a really
disappointing yacht party.

-You remember that?
-It was the worst yacht party ever!

49:01.522 --> 49:03.149
-[Isabella] It was terrible.
-[Blake] Oh!

49:03.232 --> 49:04.900
But, speaking of great parties,

49:04.984 --> 49:07.695
you guys have to come
to the Hamptons this weekend.

49:07.778 --> 49:10.197
We're having a few of my friends over

49:10.281 --> 49:11.991
at my charming little beach house.

49:12.074 --> 49:13.200
[Blake] That sounds lovely.

49:13.284 --> 49:15.369
Well, I was gonna take
my helicopter out anyway, so...

49:15.453 --> 49:18.581
So funny. I was gonna offer you guys
a ride in my helicopter.

49:18.664 --> 49:21.584
That's so sweet, darling,
but better we take our own.

49:21.667 --> 49:25.421
Nat and I might wanna hit the, er,
old Caperoo, if you know what I mean.

49:25.504 --> 49:28.966
-Oh, I know what you mean. I see you.
-I... I don't. What does that mean?

49:29.049 --> 49:30.509
[Isabella chuckles]

49:30.593 --> 49:33.012
You two have such amazing chemistry.

49:33.804 --> 49:35.014
Maybe we should swap.

49:38.976 --> 49:40.269
[chuckles]

49:40.352 --> 49:42.188
-She's joking. Yeah, she's joking.
-What?

49:42.897 --> 49:44.315
Well, what do you think? Hamptons?

49:45.483 --> 49:47.359
You had me at hello-copter.

50:10.174 --> 50:11.175
This lobster...

50:11.926 --> 50:13.302
is the size of a cat.

50:13.969 --> 50:15.095
Yet it's...

50:15.846 --> 50:17.348
as tender as a marshmallow.

50:17.431 --> 50:19.558
[chuckles] "Tender as a marshmallow."

50:20.518 --> 50:22.228
[sighs] You are beguiling.

50:23.187 --> 50:25.940
Did you just learn that word?
'Cause you tend to say it a lot.

50:26.023 --> 50:27.775
If you want me to stop saying it, I will.

50:28.526 --> 50:31.028
But you're gonna have to stop
being so damn beguiling.

-Oh. Sorry, it's my father.

50:35.157 --> 50:36.116
Y'ello?

[Josh] It's so good to see you guys.
Thanks for coming.

50:46.669 --> 50:47.670
Thank you. Thank you.

50:47.753 --> 50:50.548
Okay. Oh, you're squeezing some too, yeah.

50:50.631 --> 50:52.550
Okay, we're gettin' it. Oh.

50:52.633 --> 50:53.801

-There you go. Get on you...

50:56.804 --> 50:57.930
Phew.

51:00.391 --> 51:01.559
-Hey.
-Hey.

51:03.227 --> 51:06.313
So, you and Blake
are kind of a thing, huh?

51:06.397 --> 51:08.607
-Well, you and Isabella...
-[chuckles]

51:08.691 --> 51:09.567
-I know.
-Huh?

51:09.650 --> 51:12.361
Who'd have thought that me and you
would both end up with just, like...

51:12.444 --> 51:13.487
perfect humans?

51:14.196 --> 51:15.364
-Yeah. It's...
-Crazy.

51:15.447 --> 51:17.950
-[chuckling] Yeah, really... really crazy.
-Yeah.

51:19.076 --> 51:19.994
Aah.

51:20.578 --> 51:21.704
You know what's funny?

51:22.788 --> 51:25.499
The fact that all those rich ladies
have crabs?

51:25.583 --> 51:26.917
Well, yes, that is funny.

51:27.001 --> 51:29.920
But, at one point, I thought
it would actually be me and you

51:30.004 --> 51:31.380
that would end up together.

51:32.006 --> 51:32.881
You did?

51:33.424 --> 51:34.633
Yeah, in the beginning.

ask me out right now?

51:42.308 --> 51:43.976
[laughs] I did.

51:44.059 --> 51:45.686
All the time. You'd always say no.

51:45.769 --> 51:47.313
You'd shoot me down, and...

51:47.396 --> 51:49.231
And then we became
such good friends, so...

51:49.315 --> 51:50.733
What are you talking about?

51:51.317 --> 51:52.860
Uh... I never shot you down.

51:53.360 --> 51:55.404
I asked you out, like, a million times.

51:56.196 --> 51:59.199
For, like, drinks
at happy hour after work,

51:59.283 --> 52:01.910
or to go to the karaoke bar
with your kickball team.

52:01.994 --> 52:05.873
I didn't wanna sit there and listen to you
chat about some girl you had a crush on.

52:05.956 --> 52:09.460
Okay, why do you say kickball team
like it's a bad thing? Hm?

52:10.002 --> 52:12.838

52:22.640 --> 52:24.642
Are you comfortable with that nickname?

52:24.975 --> 52:26.477
It seems kind of like a negative.

52:26.560 --> 52:27.770
Oh, you don't like it?

52:28.604 --> 52:31.815

Hi, everyone, and thank you so much
for coming to this modest little thing

52:45.496 --> 52:47.414
we threw together last minute. [chuckles]

52:47.498 --> 52:51.168
I think we all know the story
of how Isabella and I met,

52:51.669 --> 52:53.379
but I will tell it again.

52:53.462 --> 52:54.797
I was walking.

52:54.880 --> 52:58.217
Yeah, with me, his best friend. I'm...
I'm his best friend, so...

52:58.300 --> 53:00.219
Yep, I was just walking,

53:00.302 --> 53:02.971
and I saw this beautiful woman
choking, so--

53:03.055 --> 53:04.640
-Like... [gags]
-Yeah.

53:04.723 --> 53:05.891
So I ran up to her...

53:06.558 --> 53:08.018
and gave her the Heimlich...

53:08.477 --> 53:10.104
and then she gave me her heart.

53:10.187 --> 53:11.480
[all] Aww!

53:11.563 --> 53:12.606
That's gross.

53:13.524 --> 53:15.192
Isabella, you are totally...

53:15.776 --> 53:17.236
and utterly yourself.

53:17.611 --> 53:20.698
And you are so confident,

53:20.781 --> 53:23.742
and you're never afraid
to go after what you want.

53:23.826 --> 53:27.246

-Come here.

54:11.874 --> 54:14.501

And then I took a bus here like an animal.
Oh, my goodness.

I sat next to a woman eating spaghetti
out of a Ziploc bag. Uh, no.

54:21.467 --> 54:23.719
-Okay. I don't need the play-by-gay.
-And then--

54:29.266 --> 54:31.310
Yeah, and the weirdest thing
just happened.

54:31.393 --> 54:33.812
He just said to me that he thought
we'd always end up together.

54:33.896 --> 54:35.022
But now he's getting married.

54:35.105 --> 54:37.608

had a ton of chemistry with

-Okay.

54:45.365 --> 54:47.284

you two couldn't have sex.

Erm... No, we can't, but...

54:57.961 --> 55:00.172

-That's my booch.

55:08.764 --> 55:10.474

-Yeah.

55:11.016 --> 55:12.851

'Cause he's such a nerd
and he's so sweet and...

55:16.146 --> 55:17.898
he just... like, he really gets me,

and that one time when I thought
he was moving away forever...

55:21.485 --> 55:22.611

I knew you were gonna
be weird about this.

1:01:24.139 --> 1:01:25.432
Because it's weird.

1:01:25.515 --> 1:01:28.852
We met under, like,
really intense circumstances.

1:01:28.935 --> 1:01:31.313
You know, it, like...
like, speeds things up.

1:01:32.647 --> 1:01:35.567
That's dopamine,
that's your brain on drugs.

1:01:35.650 --> 1:01:36.860
-Aah...
-It is.

1:01:37.402 --> 1:01:39.654
What are you gonna do
when the drugs wear off?

1:01:41.281 --> 1:01:42.407
I don't know. We'll...

1:01:43.450 --> 1:01:44.618
figure it out.

1:01:46.203 --> 1:01:48.663
Don't you wanna figure it out
with someone you really know?

1:01:50.248 --> 1:01:53.084
I guess that's why they say
you should marry your best friend.

1:02:04.012 --> 1:02:05.430
Maybe in a different world.

1:02:08.391 --> 1:02:09.601
I should get goin'.

1:02:11.811 --> 1:02:12.812
Big day tomorrow.

1:02:15.732 --> 1:02:16.608
Yeah.

1:02:18.318 --> 1:02:19.444
Yep, big day.

1:02:25.325 --> 1:02:28.161
[Blake] Oh, that's so great, Dad.
I'm so glad you love it.

1:02:28.245 --> 1:02:31.164
You're right, it is innovative.
And I came up with it all by myself.

1:02:31.831 --> 1:02:35.085
I'll fill in the architects and they can
work up the official plans and models.

1:02:35.168 --> 1:02:36.628
Okay? Goodbye.

1:02:37.170 --> 1:02:38.713
-[seagulls calling]

1:02:39.839 --> 1:02:41.841
Oh, good morning, beautiful.

1:02:41.925 --> 1:02:43.510
Are they my plans?

1:02:43.593 --> 1:02:44.511
[sighs]

1:02:44.594 --> 1:02:47.055
God, you look beautiful
in the morning light.

1:02:47.138 --> 1:02:49.808
Were you just pitching my idea
and passing it off as your own?

1:02:49.891 --> 1:02:50.934
No.

1:02:51.017 --> 1:02:53.144
Well, I saw them
when I was in your apartment.

1:02:53.228 --> 1:02:56.815
And the idea was for me, so...
whose idea is it, really? [chuckles]

1:02:57.774 --> 1:02:59.776
-Mine.
-Whoa. Hey.

1:03:01.027 --> 1:03:03.947
Don't know where all this crazy
assertiveness is coming from.

1:03:04.030 --> 1:03:06.700
Let's be honest, you weren't gonna be able
to pitch it to me now anyways.

1:03:06.783 --> 1:03:10.036
-Yeah, I was. Why wouldn't I?
-No, you... No, you weren't.

1:03:10.120 --> 1:03:12.497
Darling, now that you're with me,
you're not gonna be working anymore.

1:03:12.580 --> 1:03:16.167
My girl, slumming it in the realm
of the employed? Not on my watch.

1:03:16.251 --> 1:03:18.753
Mmm... I like being an architect.

1:03:18.837 --> 1:03:19.921
Come on, don't be silly.

1:03:21.006 --> 1:03:24.092
We should also, at some point,
talk about changing your name.

1:03:24.175 --> 1:03:27.679
You're really projecting.
You think, what, we're gonna get married?

1:03:27.762 --> 1:03:29.389
[chuckles] Well, yes.

1:03:30.265 --> 1:03:31.933
And obviously,
we'll change your last name.

1:03:32.017 --> 1:03:34.519
But no, I'm talking about your first name.
Natalie?

1:03:35.061 --> 1:03:37.397
I really don't think it's gonna work
in my circles.

1:03:37.480 --> 1:03:39.399
So I was thinking Georgina.

1:03:39.482 --> 1:03:42.819
What do you think? Georgina? [chuckles]

1:03:43.320 --> 1:03:44.988
-You are...
-Beguiling.

1:03:45.071 --> 1:03:46.031
...horrible.

1:03:47.866 --> 1:03:49.409
You're a horrible person.

1:03:50.660 --> 1:03:53.621
Okay, I... I think you're just tired,
darling. Why don't you go back to bed?

1:03:53.705 --> 1:03:55.165
Why don't you piss off?

1:03:56.583 --> 1:03:58.084
[sighs]

1:03:59.961 --> 1:04:01.254
It is so sad...

1:04:01.838 --> 1:04:04.174
to watch someone you love
go mad with ambition.

1:04:04.591 --> 1:04:06.593
-Do you know who said that?
-No.

1:04:06.968 --> 1:04:08.136
And now you never will.

1:04:12.015 --> 1:04:13.141
I could Google it.

1:04:28.114 --> 1:04:29.866
Erm... Where are you going?

1:04:30.367 --> 1:04:32.243
-Home, booch.
-Home?

1:04:32.744 --> 1:04:35.538
-The wedding starts in, like, 20 minutes.
-Uh, yeah.

1:04:35.622 --> 1:04:37.123
-I don't give a shit.
-What?

1:04:37.207 --> 1:04:39.125
I tried to just be open.

1:04:39.209 --> 1:04:41.753
I tried to get Josh
to fall in love with me,

1:04:41.836 --> 1:04:43.630
but that's not on the cards.

1:04:44.964 --> 1:04:47.384
Not for a girl like me. Mm-mm.

1:04:47.467 --> 1:04:49.552
Not even in this dumb, perfect world.

1:04:51.179 --> 1:04:52.013
[sighs]

1:04:58.895 --> 1:05:01.106
You know, when I was younger...

1:05:02.440 --> 1:05:06.653
I was so afraid
to put myself out there for love

1:05:06.736 --> 1:05:09.906
that I became this quirky little queen

1:05:09.989 --> 1:05:13.326
that just followed all my handsome
gay guy friends around.

1:05:13.410 --> 1:05:15.328
Like I was a pilot fish. Ugh!

1:05:15.412 --> 1:05:16.621
And I would make 'em laugh,

1:05:16.704 --> 1:05:19.707
and I would find, like,
the best parties to go to,

1:05:19.791 --> 1:05:22.877
and I would always comfort them
when their hearts were broken.

1:05:24.045 --> 1:05:25.880
But you know what nobody ever knew?

1:05:27.590 --> 1:05:28.550
That my heart...

1:05:29.217 --> 1:05:30.677
was constantly broken.

1:05:33.388 --> 1:05:34.347
Constantly.

1:05:37.100 --> 1:05:38.476
I mean, and how could they?

1:05:39.352 --> 1:05:40.770
I never let them see it.

1:05:43.440 --> 1:05:45.859
And it wasn't until I met
this palm reader in Ibiza,

1:05:45.942 --> 1:05:47.861
and she said to me, she said...

1:05:48.570 --> 1:05:50.738
"You can search the entire universe...

1:05:52.031 --> 1:05:54.451
and never find a being
more worthy of love...

1:05:55.535 --> 1:05:56.411
than yourself."

1:05:59.497 --> 1:06:02.250
So that's why I'm such the happy
little whore that I am today.

1:06:02.417 --> 1:06:04.794
[chuckles]
'Cause I love my bitchy little ass.

1:06:05.378 --> 1:06:06.212
[sighs]

1:06:07.547 --> 1:06:08.965
Who do you love, Natalie?

1:06:16.097 --> 1:06:16.973
Josh.

1:06:17.765 --> 1:06:19.893
I've never had the chance
to tell him that.

1:06:20.643 --> 1:06:22.187
I need to tell him that.

1:06:22.270 --> 1:06:23.605
Right now. Erm...

1:06:24.189 --> 1:06:27.192
Oh, I'm never gonna make it.
But I have to try.

1:06:27.275 --> 1:06:30.320
Oh, my God, of course. Why am I so dumb?

1:06:30.403 --> 1:06:32.906
It was always gonna come down
to running to stop the wedding!

1:06:32.989 --> 1:06:34.324
Well, then, you run, girl.

1:06:34.866 --> 1:06:37.535

It's tableside guac.

1:12:41.732 --> 1:12:44.402
Oh, no. You're still gay,
you must be trapped.

1:12:44.485 --> 1:12:46.654
Wait, what? What do you mean, trapped?

1:12:46.737 --> 1:12:48.072
I've been gay for forever.

1:12:48.155 --> 1:12:50.491
What? What about all those girls
that come to the apartment?

1:12:50.575 --> 1:12:54.120
I sell weed, and we live like a block
from an all-girls school.

1:12:54.203 --> 1:12:56.455
-Did you not know that?
-Huh?

1:12:56.539 --> 1:12:58.708
Oh, right, 'cause gay guys
can't be drug dealers.

1:12:58.791 --> 1:12:59.876
-That's offensive.
-Yeah.

1:12:59.959 --> 1:13:02.336
[camply] You like your gay guys
to talk like this? Is that it?

1:13:02.420 --> 1:13:03.921

1:13:04.005 --> 1:13:05.756

1:13:15.141 --> 1:13:16.058

1:13:19.228 --> 1:13:21.022

1:13:27.403 --> 1:13:30.072
Hey, Nat. I'm running late to a meeting.
Can you clean this up for me?

1:13:30.156 --> 1:13:33.910
Erm, I have things to do and places to be,
so why don't you clean that shit up?

1:13:33.993 --> 1:13:35.828

You? Call you?
Is that what you were gonna ask me?

1:13:44.795 --> 1:13:47.173
You're the person to call
when something breaks in the office.

1:13:47.256 --> 1:13:50.134
-No, actually, I was gonna--
-Sorry, one second, I'm just gonna call.

1:13:50.217 --> 1:13:51.802

1:13:51.886 --> 1:13:53.971

[Natalie] Oh, Whitney.

1:13:59.185 --> 1:14:01.479
-Oh, my God! Hi!
-Hi.

1:14:01.562 --> 1:14:02.980
I know it was only like one day,

1:14:03.064 --> 1:14:05.691
but I missed you, like, a lot,
an unhealthy amount.

1:14:05.775 --> 1:14:07.193
What happened? Are you okay?

1:14:07.276 --> 1:14:09.403
I am actually the best I've ever been.

1:14:10.363 --> 1:14:11.572
But please, okay,

1:14:11.656 --> 1:14:14.367
you need to promise me
that we will never ever fight again.

1:14:14.450 --> 1:14:16.035
What? We would never fight.

1:14:16.118 --> 1:14:18.704
Mostly because you let me
watch movies all day.

1:14:18.788 --> 1:14:21.874
Well, about that, I was thinking
that we cut back on the movies.

1:14:22.583 --> 1:14:24.001
-You're right, totally right.
-Yeah.

1:14:24.085 --> 1:14:25.628
I could stop whenever I want.

1:14:25.711 --> 1:14:27.046
They're unimportant to me.

1:14:27.129 --> 1:14:28.381
Erm... How about one a day?

1:14:28.464 --> 1:14:29.382
How about none a week?

1:14:29.465 --> 1:14:30.675
Okay, tough but fair.

1:14:30.758 --> 1:14:32.093
Yeah, like my leg hair.

1:14:42.311 --> 1:14:43.688

1:14:44.939 --> 1:14:45.815
What do you do?

1:14:46.440 --> 1:14:47.942
Take a seat, darl, you'll find out.

1:14:48.025 --> 1:14:51.195
I think you'll find it very... beguiling.

1:14:51.904 --> 1:14:52.780
[boss] Natalie.

1:14:53.072 --> 1:14:55.449
I'm presenting my idea for his hotel.

1:14:55.533 --> 1:14:57.410
We're not doing that yet.

1:14:57.493 --> 1:14:59.453
Well, I am. I'm ready.

1:14:59.996 --> 1:15:01.038
Ow! Oh.

1:15:01.539 --> 1:15:06.669
Okay, Mr. Lewis, I've been thinking
a lot lately about what we value,

1:15:07.003 --> 1:15:11.132
what we deem worthy of investing
our time and love

1:15:11.215 --> 1:15:13.926
and, of course, our money into, so...

1:15:14.010 --> 1:15:17.054
as we design your exciting new hotel,

1:15:17.513 --> 1:15:20.349
I would like to first focus
on the parking garage.

1:15:20.975 --> 1:15:22.351
The parking garage?

1:15:23.769 --> 1:15:24.854
Yep.

1:15:25.354 --> 1:15:29.025
Think about it.
They're dark... they're closed off.

1:15:30.860 --> 1:15:34.238
[chuckles]
Nobody ever really notices them.

1:15:37.199 --> 1:15:38.701
But what if we open them up?

1:15:40.828 --> 1:15:42.121
What if we actually...

1:15:42.955 --> 1:15:44.373
made something of them?

1:15:45.041 --> 1:15:46.250
Made them bright and airy...

1:15:46.876 --> 1:15:49.420
and there were glass walls everywhere?

1:15:49.503 --> 1:15:50.963
And then, suddenly...

1:15:51.756 --> 1:15:53.966
something that was invisible,

1:15:54.050 --> 1:15:56.635
something nobody ever cared about

1:15:56.719 --> 1:15:58.179
or looked twice at...

1:15:59.346 --> 1:16:01.390
suddenly, they're not invisible anymore.

1:16:02.183 --> 1:16:03.934
People actually look at them and...

1:16:04.727 --> 1:16:05.728
see beauty.

1:16:07.438 --> 1:16:08.522
They see something...

1:16:09.231 --> 1:16:10.107
at least.

1:16:11.192 --> 1:16:13.069
I think that could be,
like, really special.

1:16:13.152 --> 1:16:14.070
[Blake] Hm.

1:16:18.282 --> 1:16:19.617
It's actually not a bad idea.

1:16:19.700 --> 1:16:20.576
Thank you.

1:16:21.035 --> 1:16:23.370
It's actually a great idea,
that I thought of.

1:16:24.246 --> 1:16:26.123
And I'm just gonna get started on it.

1:16:26.624 --> 1:16:27.958
All right, let's do it.

1:16:28.042 --> 1:16:30.169
Okay, I'll see you guys later. Peace out.

1:16:31.504 --> 1:16:32.838
What does beguiling mean?

1:16:32.922 --> 1:16:35.007

1:16:46.811 --> 1:16:48.229
-Yeah, okay.
-What's up, Nat?

1:16:48.312 --> 1:16:51.023
You need to stop staring out that window

1:16:51.107 --> 1:16:53.692
at some stupid girl
in some stupid little swimsuit.

1:16:53.776 --> 1:16:55.986
Okay? That's not all
it's cracked up to be.

1:16:56.070 --> 1:16:58.405
You need to start living
in the real world,

1:16:58.489 --> 1:17:00.699
and stop thinking
that you're gonna get with some model,

1:17:00.783 --> 1:17:02.368
and that that's gonna make you happy.

1:17:02.451 --> 1:17:03.327

1:17:03.410 --> 1:17:05.454
Okay, here, take a seat.

Come on, sit down.

1:17:07.790 --> 1:17:08.999
-You're not--
-Come on.

1:17:09.083 --> 1:17:10.835
-You're not pushing me again?
-No, no, no, no.

1:17:10.918 --> 1:17:12.503
Hang on. Okay.

1:17:12.586 --> 1:17:14.255

1:17:18.717 --> 1:17:19.969

1:17:39.155 --> 1:17:41.073

1:17:57.298 --> 1:17:58.424

I'm always lookin' at you.

1:18:03.345 --> 1:18:04.221
Josh...

1:18:05.848 --> 1:18:06.974
You're such an idiot.

1:18:18.110 --> 1:18:19.195
Okay.

1:18:19.612 --> 1:18:21.614
-Well!
-[chuckles]

1:18:23.657 --> 1:18:25.409
Maybe we should go out sometime, then.

1:18:25.492 --> 1:18:26.452
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1:18:26.535 --> 1:18:27.912
-If you wanted to.
-That'd be great.

1:18:27.995 --> 1:18:30.289
Okay. Yeah, good. Good-- Great. Great.

1:18:30.372 --> 1:18:31.957
-Yeah, let's...
-Yeah.

1:18:32.625 --> 1:18:35.044
Why are we talkin'
like we're angry with each other?

1:18:35.127 --> 1:18:37.588
I don't know. I was just on a roll
this morning, and now I'm...

1:18:40.424 --> 1:18:42.009
Now I'm really happy. [chuckles]

1:18:42.092 --> 1:18:43.761
So, uh, this weekend?

1:18:44.595 --> 1:18:45.596
Karaoke or something?

1:18:46.055 --> 1:18:47.348
Yeah, that'd be...

1:18:48.015 --> 1:18:50.559
Yeah. I mean, I might outshine you, but...

1:18:52.561 --> 1:18:53.729
-Okay, all right.
-Cool.

1:19:08.202 --> 1:19:10.204
-Yeah, it should...
--This is gonna take a long time.

1:19:45.698 --> 1:19:47.491
Wait, did you just run down the stairs?

1:19:47.574 --> 1:19:49.618
I'm trying to be calm,
but where are you going?

1:19:49.702 --> 1:19:51.370
I'm just getting a coffee.

1:19:51.453 --> 1:19:53.372
'Cause I'm now my own coffee bitch.

1:19:53.455 --> 1:19:56.625
I just wanted to say I'm so proud of you.
Upstairs was amazing.

1:19:56.709 --> 1:19:59.586
Just to be clear,
Josh does not complete me.

1:19:59.712 --> 1:20:01.213
I complete myself.

1:20:01.964 --> 1:20:03.173
You know, God...

1:20:04.049 --> 1:20:05.509

1:20:05.592 --> 1:20:08.637
