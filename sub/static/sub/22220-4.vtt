WEBVTT

00:06.799 --> 00:08.209
Crichton:
Fine, yes, you're right.

00:08.342 --> 00:10.253
We know almost nothing about
the Tavloids.

00:10.386 --> 00:11.091
Tavleks.

00:11.220 --> 00:12.300
Whatever. Tavloid, Tavlek.

00:12.430 --> 00:14.967
We do know that they will
pay us to haul cargo

00:15.099 --> 00:18.387
which they're not going to do
if you go in there doing your
John Wayne impression.

00:18.519 --> 00:20.180
John Wayne? Who's that?
A relative?

00:20.313 --> 00:22.144
John Wayne? The big guy.

00:22.273 --> 00:25.231
True Grit, The Searchers,
The Cowboys, Genghis Khan.

00:25.359 --> 00:27.816
Look, forget about Genghis Khan
everybody makes a bad movie...

00:27.945 --> 00:29.196
but the point is...

00:29.322 --> 00:32.155
No. The point is, I'm not going
to meet that shuttle unarmed.

00:32.283 --> 00:33.648
It's as simple as that.

00:33.784 --> 00:35.399
Kung Fu...

00:35.536 --> 00:37.618
Kung Fu... never carried a gun.

00:37.747 --> 00:43.208
We, Rygel the 16th, Dominar
of the Hynerian Empire

00:43.336 --> 00:50.378
and beloved sovereign of over
600 billion subjects...

00:52.053 --> 00:54.669
welcome to our yacht.

00:54.805 --> 00:57.182
I still say it's a bad idea.

00:57.308 --> 00:59.014
I should be taller.

00:59.143 --> 01:00.428
It's tall enough already.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.643
I need them to look up to me.

01:02.772 --> 01:04.262
Why? we don't.

01:04.398 --> 01:05.478
Well, you should.

01:05.608 --> 01:08.315
If it wasn't for me,
we'd starve.

01:08.444 --> 01:10.025
On Porzin Two, it was I...

01:10.154 --> 01:13.146
All you got was stale
food cubes.

01:13.282 --> 01:18.026
Which you ate more than your
fair share of, as I recall.

01:18.162 --> 01:19.993
Who are you to order me around?

01:20.122 --> 01:22.033
Order? l was offering a
suggesﬂon.

01:22.166 --> 01:23.781
Well, who are you to offer
suggesﬂons?

01:23.918 --> 01:27.206
Am I the only species in
creation that doesn't thrive
on conflict?

01:27.338 --> 01:29.169
All of you, shut up.

01:29.298 --> 01:30.754
Yes, that's right. Shut up.

01:30.883 --> 01:32.259
Now, the Tavleks believe...

01:32.385 --> 01:34.876
"Shut up" includes you.

01:35.012 --> 01:37.094
Now, we don't even know what
this Tavlek cargo is.

01:37.223 --> 01:40.090
It could be contraband,
vermin-infested, even toxic.

01:40.226 --> 01:41.887
Well, let's hope so.

01:42.019 --> 01:43.634
We could charge more.

01:43.771 --> 01:46.353
D'argo, we've had this
discussion. You were outvoted.

01:46.482 --> 01:47.847
Oh, argue later.

01:47.984 --> 01:48.689
They've docked.

01:48.818 --> 01:51.605
Positions, please. Come on now.

01:51.737 --> 01:56.572
If you must address me, do so
as your Supreme Eminence.

01:56.701 --> 02:00.444
Which you should be
doing anyway.

02:03.874 --> 02:05.250
No movement.

02:05.376 --> 02:07.412
Remain where you are.

02:09.714 --> 02:12.000
Move and you die.

02:16.512 --> 02:18.093
Try me.

02:21.892 --> 02:24.099
You... you've misunderstood...

02:26.564 --> 02:28.725
What do you think you're doing?

02:29.859 --> 02:32.851
I demand someone help me!

02:32.987 --> 02:34.978
D'argo, look out.

02:35.114 --> 02:36.570
Someone put a stop to this!

02:42.204 --> 02:44.035
You'll pay for...

02:47.585 --> 02:48.700
And now you die.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.372
Crichton:
Yo, buttkissl

02:54.717 --> 02:56.878
Cover me. I'll get the Dominar.

02:57.470 --> 02:59.506
Pilot, shut the door!

03:01.682 --> 03:04.674
Rygel:
Unhand me! Please!

03:05.144 --> 03:07.385
Please!

03:11.275 --> 03:12.936
How does it work?

03:14.320 --> 03:15.150
Junk!

03:15.279 --> 03:16.109
Where's Rygel?

03:16.238 --> 03:17.944
D'Argo:
Junk!

03:19.241 --> 03:21.857
Our Supreme Eminence
has been bagged.

03:29.377 --> 03:31.333
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut...

03:31.462 --> 03:34.295
...a radiation wave hit and I
got shot through a wormhole...

03:34.423 --> 03:36.914
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe

03:37.051 --> 03:38.587
on a ship-- a living ship

03:38.719 --> 03:41.005
Full of strange alien
life-forms...

03:41.138 --> 03:41.968
Help me, help me...

03:42.098 --> 03:43.133
Listen, please.

03:43.265 --> 03:45.392
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

03:45.518 --> 03:49.557
...I'm being hunted by an
insane military commander...

03:49.688 --> 03:52.065
...doing everything I can...

03:52.191 --> 03:54.432
I'm just looking for
a way home.

04:18.759 --> 04:21.171
Pilot, get a tractor beam
on that shuttle!

04:21.303 --> 04:22.634
Trakterbeem?

04:22.763 --> 04:23.923
What's that?

04:24.056 --> 04:26.297
Graviton field, attracto-ray,
super glue...

04:26.434 --> 04:28.265
Whatever it is you yanked
me aboard with.

04:28.394 --> 04:29.554
You mean the docking web.

04:29.687 --> 04:31.177
Fine, use it on the shuttle.

04:31.313 --> 04:32.223
It's out of range.

04:32.356 --> 04:34.142
Well, then go after it.

04:34.275 --> 04:37.267
Correction, Pilot. Break orbit
and take us away from this
wretched planet.

04:37.403 --> 04:39.064
Take us away?
They've got Rygel.

04:39.196 --> 04:42.063
Rygel brought this on himself.
I say we leave him there.

04:42.199 --> 04:43.063
Let Crichton finish.

04:43.200 --> 04:46.112
Look, enough talk.
We are leaving now.

04:51.292 --> 04:53.704
Th-that can't be normal.
H-how did you do that?

04:53.836 --> 04:55.497
It just happened.

04:56.422 --> 04:57.377
Wait.

04:57.506 --> 05:00.088
That is a very versatile
and powerful weapon.

05:00.217 --> 05:02.173
If we can work out how
to use it...

05:02.303 --> 05:04.134
What is this? Is it injecting
something into you?

05:04.263 --> 05:06.049
lt stuck some needles
in my arm.

05:06.182 --> 05:07.547
Oh, no, that can't be good.

05:07.683 --> 05:08.593
Take it off.

05:08.726 --> 05:10.011
Let go of me!

05:10.144 --> 05:11.384
D'argo...

05:11.520 --> 05:14.307
This ship needs a leader, and
none of you have what it takes.

05:14.440 --> 05:18.183
From now on, lam in charge.

05:22.615 --> 05:27.985
Never lay your hands
on me again.

05:29.413 --> 05:31.369
You go after him.
I'll revive the boy.

05:36.086 --> 05:37.246
Crichton:
D'argo, would you wait?

05:37.379 --> 05:38.835
No. I'm giving the orders now.

05:38.964 --> 05:40.579
D'argo, just listen.

05:42.801 --> 05:44.507
He's not good at listening,
is he?

05:44.637 --> 05:46.093
Well, he'll listen to this.

05:46.222 --> 05:47.712
Aeryn, no.

05:51.810 --> 05:53.892
Would you listen?

05:56.023 --> 05:57.604
( sniffing )

05:57.733 --> 05:58.939
Take it easy, child.

05:59.068 --> 05:59.978
Child?!

06:00.110 --> 06:01.099
Don't be afraid.
We won't hurt you.

06:01.237 --> 06:03.102
Speak for yourself.

06:03.239 --> 06:04.479
That weapon of yours.
How do we get it off?

06:04.615 --> 06:07.027
You mean one of you was stupid
enough to put it on?

06:07.159 --> 06:08.399
You're too weak to handle it.

06:08.536 --> 06:10.743
Why? what is that stuff
it pumps in you?

06:10.871 --> 06:13.328
A stimulant.
Adds to our strength.

06:13.457 --> 06:14.993
A stimulant?

06:15.125 --> 06:16.865
It's a little more than
cappuccino, pal.

06:17.002 --> 06:18.538
Our friend just tried
to kill us.

06:18.671 --> 06:19.251
Good.

06:19.380 --> 06:20.916
How do we remove it?

06:21.048 --> 06:22.959
You can't.

06:23.092 --> 06:26.084
Well, it came off when
I knocked you out.

06:26.220 --> 06:28.176
That'd make sense. If you're
left unconscious in battle

06:28.305 --> 06:30.637
you don't want the enemy
cutting your arm off to
get your weapon.

06:30.766 --> 06:34.554
Hmm. You can be disarmed
without having to be dis-armed.

06:34.687 --> 06:36.223
Great.

06:36.355 --> 06:38.846
So what do we got that can
knock D'argo out?

06:38.983 --> 06:40.268
Stun gun?

06:40.401 --> 06:41.607
Gas grenade?

06:41.735 --> 06:43.020
Sleep mist.

06:43.153 --> 06:45.018
I can formulate one.

06:49.118 --> 06:50.153
Was that necessary?

06:50.286 --> 06:53.198
It felt good.
Give me navigation, now.

06:53.330 --> 06:54.536
But we can't leave orbit...

06:54.665 --> 06:56.872
Do as I say or I'll rip off
all your arms.

06:57.001 --> 06:58.286
Enough of this stupid voting.

06:58.419 --> 07:00.626
From now on, I'll make
the decisions.

07:02.381 --> 07:04.121
Don't even think about it.

07:04.258 --> 07:08.126
Unless we leave orbit D'argo's
actually threatening
to injure me.

07:08.262 --> 07:11.675
Stall him. Tell him there's
a systems malfunction
or something.

07:11.807 --> 07:15.675
I told him that but he
doesn't believe me.

07:15.811 --> 07:17.312
In fact, he...

07:17.438 --> 07:20.350
Hold on. Transmission
from the planet.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.936
Bekhesh:
We've got your king.

07:24.069 --> 07:25.479
You can buy him back.

07:25.613 --> 07:27.444
Aeryn:
We've got your boy, and if you
want him back undamaged...

07:27.573 --> 07:29.529
Whoa! Ho! How about
an even swap?

07:29.658 --> 07:30.943
No.

07:31.076 --> 07:34.409
He's part of the price, but
he's not worth a king.

07:34.538 --> 07:36.699
We want corvinium, purity nine.

07:36.832 --> 07:39.073
Enough to fill your
transport hangar.

07:39.209 --> 07:40.710
This hangar?

07:40.836 --> 07:45.079
Divided among 600 billion
affluent subjects it's
not so much.

07:45.215 --> 07:46.716
You won't get it.

07:46.842 --> 07:49.458
Pilot:
D'argo's getting angrier.
Do something.

07:49.595 --> 07:53.179
Look, this isn't a good time.

07:53.307 --> 07:54.137
How about we call you back?

07:54.266 --> 07:55.130
Bekhesh:
No.

07:55.267 --> 07:58.555
We'll contact you in
one solar day.

07:58.687 --> 08:03.147
If your homeworld hasn't
agreed to our terms by
then your king dies.

08:03.275 --> 08:05.687
John, it's finished.

08:08.405 --> 08:11.317
Check it out.
It's a water balloon.

08:11.450 --> 08:12.235
Here.

08:12.368 --> 08:13.653
What?

08:13.786 --> 08:15.697
Oh, you think you can throw
it with any accuracy?

08:15.829 --> 08:17.694
Yeah. I grew up with
these things.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.287
Excellent.

08:19.416 --> 08:21.623
Lock him away.

08:21.752 --> 08:23.083
Well, I suppose we must.

08:23.212 --> 08:24.577
Come.

08:27.508 --> 08:30.090
Pilot, get Moya moving.

08:30.219 --> 08:32.301
I told you, I can't.

08:32.429 --> 08:33.384
You're lying.

08:33.514 --> 08:35.379
You're all undermining
my command...

08:40.437 --> 08:42.769
Crichton:
Good night, sweet prince.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.362
Uh-oh.

08:54.493 --> 08:56.029
(growling)

08:56.954 --> 08:58.160
This way.

08:58.288 --> 09:00.244
Oh, is that another
suggestion of yours?

09:00.374 --> 09:04.959
Pilot, on my signal give me all
the acceleration Moya's got.

09:05.087 --> 09:06.202
No.

09:06.338 --> 09:08.750
I can't activate propulsion.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.964
Moya has a systems malfunction.

09:11.093 --> 09:12.173
For real?

09:12.302 --> 09:14.759
Propulsion control is
completely out.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.879
I've had to shut down
and vent manually.

09:17.015 --> 09:19.176
The ship's excess supercoolant
has to be released.

09:19.309 --> 09:20.845
Look, we're wasting time here.

09:20.978 --> 09:22.718
Wait. Wait, just wait.

09:22.855 --> 09:24.186
Close all the vents.

09:24.314 --> 09:25.895
I can't do that.

09:26.024 --> 09:28.185
The pressure could build
to dangerous levels.

09:28.318 --> 09:29.307
No, it won't.

09:29.445 --> 09:31.436
I got a plan.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.113
I'm not afraid of you.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.286
You're soft and weak.

09:45.419 --> 09:46.249
Pilot:
Zhaan?

09:46.378 --> 09:48.118
Yes?

09:52.384 --> 09:56.093
Soft, yes. Weak, no.

09:56.221 --> 09:57.176
What was that, Pilot?

09:57.306 --> 09:58.716
Secure for acceleration.

09:58.849 --> 10:00.134
Crichton has an idea.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.383
( sighs ):
Did you say Crichton?

10:02.519 --> 10:05.056
Pa'u delvia, kolmot
gorr tibnol.

10:09.276 --> 10:12.734
D'Argo:
Come out from where you're
hiding, you cowards.

10:12.863 --> 10:14.023
Cool it.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.363
Now.

10:18.035 --> 10:19.275
D'argo.

10:19.411 --> 10:21.402
D'Argo:
Peacekeeper coward!

10:25.417 --> 10:30.161
( breathing heavily)

10:30.297 --> 10:31.207
Now.

10:31.340 --> 10:33.046
You challenge my command...

10:33.175 --> 10:33.800
Now.

10:33.926 --> 10:35.132
Do it to my face.

10:35.260 --> 10:36.670
-Do it now!
-We'll see who's left standing.

10:39.264 --> 10:41.129
(groaning)

10:42.434 --> 10:44.049
That was your plan?

10:44.186 --> 10:45.801
Yeah. Worked pretty good.

10:45.938 --> 10:47.223
Oh, barely.

10:47.356 --> 10:49.813
That is the last time | go
along with one of your plans.

10:49.942 --> 10:51.352
Fine!

10:53.028 --> 10:55.735
Next time you get to
make the plan.

11:17.803 --> 11:20.545
Rygel:
I demand to speak to
whoever's in charge.

11:20.681 --> 11:22.922
I will not be treated
like this.

11:23.058 --> 11:26.266
How dare you bury me in mud.

11:26.395 --> 11:27.805
Are you listening?

11:27.938 --> 11:30.270
You're nothing but barbarians.

11:30.399 --> 11:33.607
Don't you know this is
an act of war?!

11:35.404 --> 11:37.816
When my council hears of this

11:37.948 --> 11:41.907
the Hynerian Navy will
scorch this hellhole!

11:42.035 --> 11:45.027
Hmm, that should get
them thinking.

11:45.163 --> 11:47.779
Jotheb:
My sleep cycle has
been disturbed.

11:47.916 --> 11:50.874
As if I give a garanta's brax!

11:52.462 --> 11:53.497
Who are you?

11:53.630 --> 11:55.131
Jotheb...

11:55.257 --> 11:58.420
Next in succession to preside
over the Consortium of Trao.

11:58.552 --> 11:59.792
And you?

11:59.928 --> 12:04.092
Dominar Rygel the 16th, ruler
of the Hynerian Empire.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.510
The Hynerian empire is not
familiar to me.

12:06.643 --> 12:09.726
Yeah? Well, I never heard of
the Consortium of Trao.

12:09.855 --> 12:12.517
The imperfection is yours.

12:12.649 --> 12:13.559
How big is it?

12:13.692 --> 12:14.647
Ten thousand.

12:14.776 --> 12:15.856
Ha! Ha!

12:15.986 --> 12:18.227
l have six hundred
billion subjects!

12:18.363 --> 12:23.608
Ten thousand planets, each
averaging per planet
four billion Trao.

12:23.744 --> 12:25.780
I don't believe you.

12:25.913 --> 12:28.199
The imperfection is yours.

12:32.961 --> 12:35.373
This malfunction is
Rygel's fault?

12:35.505 --> 12:37.041
Pilot:
That's right.

12:37.174 --> 12:39.210
He asked if he could borrow a
vital component of Moya's

12:39.343 --> 12:41.959
control circuitry just
for a while.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.130
And you let him?

12:43.263 --> 12:45.845
Certainly not. I flatly
forbade it.

12:45.974 --> 12:47.555
What did he want it for?

12:47.684 --> 12:50.972
He said it was important to
impress our visitors.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.184
lmpress...?

12:52.314 --> 12:55.226
How is a control circuit going
to impress somebody?

12:55.359 --> 12:58.943
Oh, Moya's synaptic processors
are quite attractive objects.

12:59.071 --> 13:03.735
trillions of silico-neurons
suspended in a semi-organic
crystalline matrix.

13:03.867 --> 13:05.778
Crystal... no...

13:05.911 --> 13:08.573
Reddish crystal?
About that big?

13:08.705 --> 13:10.161
Yes.

13:10.290 --> 13:14.829
His scepter. The little hair
ball took it to decorate
his scepter.

13:14.962 --> 13:16.202
I'm going to kill him.

13:16.338 --> 13:18.624
How long can Moya maintain
orbit without the crystal?

13:18.757 --> 13:21.499
Her orbit's deteriorating
even now.

13:21.635 --> 13:23.717
l'll torture him, then
I'll kill him.

13:24.596 --> 13:25.802
Zhaan?

13:26.431 --> 13:28.217
Can't you rouse D'argo?

13:28.350 --> 13:31.137
No. He's not injured, but he's
sleeping off the drug.

13:31.269 --> 13:32.884
There's no telling when
he'll awaken.

13:33.021 --> 13:34.557
I can't wait for him.

13:34.690 --> 13:35.645
Pilot, prepare the Prowler.

13:35.774 --> 13:36.809
Very well.

13:36.942 --> 13:38.148
Come on.

13:38.276 --> 13:40.312
You're not going down there?

13:40.445 --> 13:43.653
If we don't get that crystal
back we're going to crash
into the planet.

13:43.782 --> 13:44.817
I've got a plan.

13:44.950 --> 13:47.066
Oh, no, please, let me guess.
Your plan.

13:47.202 --> 13:50.694
Jam down to the planet, conduct
a commando-style raid
against what?

13:50.831 --> 13:55.120
A couple of dozen heavily-armed
Tavloids and then haul ass
back up to the ship.

13:55.252 --> 13:56.617
Tavleks.

13:56.753 --> 13:59.039
That's your plan?

13:59.172 --> 14:02.084
Wile E. Coyote would come up
with a better plan than that!

14:02.217 --> 14:04.503
You're just going to go down
there by yourself?

14:04.636 --> 14:06.547
No, of course not.
You're coming with me.

14:06.680 --> 14:09.137
Oh, in your dreams I'm
coming with you.

14:09.266 --> 14:10.927
This is my turn.

14:11.059 --> 14:12.265
My plan.

14:12.394 --> 14:13.224
Now, let's go.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.968
No. Absolutely not.

14:15.105 --> 14:17.141
There are other things that
we can do.

14:17.274 --> 14:19.606
We can try negotiating
with the Tavloids...

14:22.154 --> 14:24.145
Tavleks.

14:28.410 --> 14:30.446
Aeryn:
Has Moya located the
Tavlek shuttle?

14:30.579 --> 14:33.286
No. Her sensors can't penetrate
the jungle canopy.

14:33.415 --> 14:35.827
Too many chloroferric compounds
in the vegetation.

14:35.959 --> 14:38.746
Pilot says we can reconfigure
the sensors.

14:38.879 --> 14:41.586
Even if you can't, I'm
following the same trajectory
their shuttle did

14:41.715 --> 14:43.956
and I should land reasonably
close to them.

14:44.092 --> 14:46.299
We can negotiate with the...

14:49.890 --> 14:51.300
You hit me.

14:51.433 --> 14:53.094
Hit? |...

14:53.226 --> 14:54.557
No, a Panthakjab.

14:54.686 --> 14:57.268
You were more susceptible
than most.

15:01.151 --> 15:03.437
Next time you hit me make sure
that I don't wake up.

15:03.570 --> 15:04.776
(clicking tongue ):
Oh...

15:04.905 --> 15:07.066
Oh, don't...
(clicking tongue ) me.

15:07.199 --> 15:09.565
This is not over with.

15:09.701 --> 15:12.943
And when it is, you and l are
going to sit down and have
a serious talk.

15:13.080 --> 15:17.915
Sure. When this is over, you
and I will probably be dead.

15:30.305 --> 15:31.511
Care for some food?

15:31.640 --> 15:33.722
I'm not hungry.

15:33.850 --> 15:34.930
Are you in discomfort?

15:35.060 --> 15:37.176
What kind of fastener is this?

15:37.312 --> 15:40.304
Where's my clothes?
I want them back now.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.429
We had to borrow them.

15:41.566 --> 15:42.476
Had to?

15:42.609 --> 15:46.193
Or did you just want
to strip me?

15:46.321 --> 15:48.186
What's the matter?
Too prim to sneak a peak?

15:48.323 --> 15:50.780
You afraid you might like
what you saw?

15:50.909 --> 15:53.571
You ever looked at a
male before, huh?

15:53.703 --> 15:55.659
Well, here you go.

16:00.168 --> 16:02.284
Quite respectable for your age.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.082
Did you think you'd shock me?

16:05.215 --> 16:07.251
ls nudity a taboo in
your culture?

16:07.384 --> 16:09.249
Are you ashamed of your bodies?

16:09.386 --> 16:11.752
Well, we would be if we
looked like you.

16:11.888 --> 16:13.719
I doubt it.

16:30.365 --> 16:31.866
Are you sure you're not hungry?

16:31.992 --> 16:33.823
(quietly):
No.

16:43.712 --> 16:47.625
Before we landed, I saw signs
of an encampment past
that ridge.

16:48.717 --> 16:50.082
(grunts)

16:50.218 --> 16:55.212
You shanghai my ass down here.
Now you want me to lead?

16:56.266 --> 16:58.131
Give me one good reason.

16:58.268 --> 16:59.383
Lots of reasons.

16:59.519 --> 17:04.183
Land mines, fire snakes,
razor grass,

17:04.316 --> 17:08.434
night-vision snipers,
morlian death spiders...

17:08.570 --> 17:10.026
(grunting)

17:10.155 --> 17:11.270
(stomach growling )

17:11.406 --> 17:14.443
Jotheb:
That dreadful noise is what?

17:14.576 --> 17:16.487
That's my stomach. What of it?

17:16.620 --> 17:19.487
You have failed to dine?
My meal was just delivered.

17:19.623 --> 17:20.863
(grunts)

17:20.999 --> 17:23.411
They fed you first?

17:23.543 --> 17:25.283
I don't want any food anyway.

17:25.420 --> 17:26.705
I want out.

17:26.838 --> 17:29.420
There must be a way.
There's always a way.

17:29.549 --> 17:32.211
Our captors may be annoyed
by escape attempts.

17:32.344 --> 17:34.630
We just can't lie around
waiting to be ransomed.

17:34.763 --> 17:35.878
We have to push!

17:36.014 --> 17:37.220
(grunting)

17:38.266 --> 17:39.221
Rygel:
Here!

17:39.351 --> 17:41.216
Let me show you.

17:41.353 --> 17:43.093
You don't have to worry, Jotheb.

17:43.230 --> 17:46.768
When my fleet arrives, it'll
lay waste to this planet.

17:46.900 --> 17:49.812
Anyone who defends Bekhesh
will be killed

17:49.945 --> 17:52.061
but anyone who helps us
will, uh...

17:52.197 --> 17:53.812
Your rations.

17:53.949 --> 17:55.655
( nervous chuckle)

17:55.784 --> 17:57.194
You see?

17:57.327 --> 18:00.114
First you give them something
to think about and then you...

18:00.247 --> 18:01.032
Ah!

18:01.164 --> 18:02.700
Is there a problem?

18:02.832 --> 18:04.788
This bowl.

18:04.918 --> 18:07.034
It's a skull.

18:07.170 --> 18:09.331
That can be no one you knew.

18:09.464 --> 18:12.627
Ah, excuse me, will you?

18:14.302 --> 18:16.293
Stop looking at me.

18:24.479 --> 18:25.309
Hey, hey!

18:25.438 --> 18:27.224
Tentacles off! Tentacles off!

18:27.357 --> 18:28.187
What do you think you're doing?

18:28.316 --> 18:30.022
It was unwanted by you.

18:30.151 --> 18:31.277
Doesn't mean you can have it.

18:31.403 --> 18:33.359
(groaning softly)

18:33.780 --> 18:35.111
Feeling better?

18:35.240 --> 18:38.107
He insists on helping us
adjust the sensors despite
his fatigue.

18:38.243 --> 18:39.733
Only because you'll
do it wrong.

18:39.869 --> 18:41.154
(angry grunt)

18:41.288 --> 18:43.199
If you need more rest...

18:43.331 --> 18:45.162
No, no. |, uh...

18:45.292 --> 18:49.535
(wearily ):
I need to do something.
Make myself useful.

18:49.671 --> 18:53.334
Your assistance would
be welcomed.

19:02.434 --> 19:04.140
Enjoying yourself?

19:04.269 --> 19:05.384
Oh, yeah.

19:05.520 --> 19:09.934
Marching through a smelly,
bug-infested jungle.

19:10.066 --> 19:13.775
If this is your idea of a good
time, I bet you don't get
a lot of second dates.

19:13.903 --> 19:15.404
(guns fire)

19:18.700 --> 19:20.190
Hand me the oculars.

19:20.327 --> 19:21.442
What?

19:30.920 --> 19:32.251
Aeryn:
Hunting party.

19:32.380 --> 19:33.836
They've made a kill.

19:36.760 --> 19:38.216
I say we follow them.

19:38.345 --> 19:40.757
They might lead us back to
their camp, back to Rygel.

19:40.889 --> 19:42.550
We don't have time to let them
lead us back to their camp.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.219
I'm going to have to force them
to tell me where Rygel is.

19:45.352 --> 19:46.888
Force them? How are you
going to force them?

19:47.020 --> 19:48.635
There's one of you and
three of them.

19:48.772 --> 19:51.309
(metallic whirring)

19:52.484 --> 19:53.564
Whew.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.274
Are you nuts?

19:55.403 --> 19:58.145
After what that thing did to
D'argo, we agreed only as
a last resort.

19:58.281 --> 20:00.272
Besides, if we go in
there blazing...

20:00.408 --> 20:03.366
I'm going in.
You're staying here.

20:04.454 --> 20:05.489
(grunts)

20:05.622 --> 20:07.032
This won't take long.

20:07.165 --> 20:10.328
When I get back, you can put me
under and remove the gauntlet.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.952
The minute you get back.

20:14.089 --> 20:15.420
(sighs)

20:22.931 --> 20:24.887
Your pardon.

20:25.016 --> 20:28.975
I'm on my way back to Bekhesh
but I seem to have gotten my
bearings confused.

20:29.104 --> 20:30.389
You mean you're lost.

20:30.522 --> 20:33.059
Yeah, okay, I'm lost.

20:33.191 --> 20:34.226
Find your own way back.

20:34.359 --> 20:35.974
We're busy.

20:36.111 --> 20:37.897
(yells and grunts)

20:42.117 --> 20:43.357
(gagging )

20:43.493 --> 20:46.075
All right, I'll ask again.

20:46.204 --> 20:47.284
Where's Bekhesh?

20:48.540 --> 20:50.246
Crichton:
Come on, Aeryn.

20:51.251 --> 20:53.287
Crichton:
They're getting up.

20:55.672 --> 20:58.084
Follow the outcropping around...

21:01.094 --> 21:04.006
(soft, high-pitched whining )

21:06.015 --> 21:07.880
What the hell?

21:08.017 --> 21:09.052
(loud droning)

21:09.185 --> 21:11.141
Oh, shit!

21:11.271 --> 21:12.351
(Crichton yelling )

21:12.480 --> 21:14.766
( explosion )

21:15.942 --> 21:16.852
We're under attack!

21:16.985 --> 21:17.895
Get to cover!

21:18.027 --> 21:19.312
Move! This way!

21:19.446 --> 21:22.483
Pilot, are you sure those
reconfigured sensors
are working?

21:22.615 --> 21:24.116
That looked like an explosion.

21:24.242 --> 21:25.072
It was.

21:25.201 --> 21:27.817
Also picking up weapons fire.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.910
Didn't take them long to
get into trouble.

21:30.039 --> 21:31.745
Ready a transport.

21:33.293 --> 21:35.124
Oh, what happened?

21:35.253 --> 21:36.709
Wait. Where's the rifle?

21:36.838 --> 21:38.248
All over the place.

21:38.381 --> 21:39.245
Am I bleeding?

21:39.382 --> 21:40.588
You blew up the rifle?

21:40.717 --> 21:42.082
It's not like I meant to.

21:42.218 --> 21:43.719
Damn thing malfunctioned
or something.

21:43.845 --> 21:45.460
Or you overloaded the
pulse chamber.

21:45.597 --> 21:46.928
Just-just drop it.

21:47.056 --> 21:48.262
Let's move before they find us.

21:48.391 --> 21:50.131
It's all right.
I'll take them all on.

21:50.268 --> 21:51.804
Aeryn, move.

21:51.936 --> 21:53.346
Stop. I'm going!

21:55.398 --> 21:59.186
Bekhesh:
Jotheb, message from
your people.

22:00.403 --> 22:03.110
Two days till your
ransom arrives.

22:03.239 --> 22:05.730
You're free to go
once it shows up.

22:05.867 --> 22:08.279
Hey! Hey! What about me?

22:08.411 --> 22:10.322
Keep silent, Rygel.

22:12.248 --> 22:13.749
What about you?

22:13.875 --> 22:16.582
I demand better treatment.

22:16.711 --> 22:22.331
You dare serve me with this
grotesquery of a bowl?

22:26.262 --> 22:29.254
My apologies your Eminence.

22:31.434 --> 22:34.176
I should think so.

22:34.312 --> 22:38.681
So, Jotheb, your subjects came
up with your ransom?

22:38.816 --> 22:41.683
It was not in doubt. Why?
Yours will not?

22:41.819 --> 22:43.400
Absolutely.

22:43.530 --> 22:45.771
Who says they won't?

22:46.324 --> 22:48.280
Ah, there you are.

22:48.409 --> 22:50.320
Now, what have you got for me?

22:50.453 --> 22:52.660
An extra helping.

22:58.294 --> 23:04.005
Any more trouble and it'll be
your skull that serves as
someone's bowl.

23:04.133 --> 23:06.966
(anguished yelling)

23:16.145 --> 23:18.056
(groaning)

23:19.440 --> 23:21.146
Get out!

23:28.992 --> 23:30.357
(grunts)

23:33.705 --> 23:35.070
I can help you.

23:41.421 --> 23:43.082
l-l don't want your help!

23:43.214 --> 23:45.671
You're in no condition
to choose.

23:58.980 --> 24:02.564
This should relieve the
symptoms of withdrawal.

24:08.406 --> 24:10.692
And this will remove the pain.

24:21.794 --> 24:24.376
I can't eat this.

24:24.505 --> 24:26.496
I couldn't eat this.

24:26.633 --> 24:29.921
l mustn't eat this.

24:30.637 --> 24:32.673
Hmm...

24:32.805 --> 24:36.923
Maybe it has another use.

24:37.060 --> 24:37.799
Hmm...

24:37.935 --> 24:41.223
In what way, friend Rygel?

24:41.356 --> 24:44.268
Loosening up the soil.

24:49.072 --> 24:51.188
Right. The camp should be
just up ahead.

24:51.324 --> 24:52.359
I'm going to enjoy this.

24:52.492 --> 24:54.073
No. No, you're not going
anywhere near there.

24:54.202 --> 24:55.442
Not till we get that
gauntlet off.

24:56.913 --> 24:59.746
You agreed. Only as long
as it was necessary.

24:59.874 --> 25:02.707
And it is necessary.
Bekhesh is still breathing.

25:02.835 --> 25:05.292
Aeryn, that gauntlet is messing
with your head.

25:05.421 --> 25:08.288
No, it's not. I am going to
take out every last Tavlek.

25:08.424 --> 25:09.880
No survivors, no mercy.

25:10.009 --> 25:11.590
Now give me the oculars!

25:12.804 --> 25:14.385
Fine.

25:24.023 --> 25:26.400
I believe you and l have
some business first.

25:26.526 --> 25:27.732
Oh, yes.

25:27.860 --> 25:30.852
You called me a coward, and
you'll die for that.

25:30.988 --> 25:34.355
Your gauntlet against my
Qualta Blade?

25:34.492 --> 25:36.448
D'Argo:
You truly are cowardly.

25:36.577 --> 25:39.159
Can't you defeat me without
your weapons?

25:40.123 --> 25:42.114
What a barbarian.

25:42.250 --> 25:44.832
Okay, so you'll die more slowly.

25:48.506 --> 25:50.542
(yelling)

25:50.675 --> 25:52.336
(hissing)

25:54.262 --> 25:56.253
Nice blanket you got
there, D'argo.

25:56.389 --> 25:58.380
A lumpy blanket. Get her off.

26:00.727 --> 26:02.968
(grunting)

26:04.397 --> 26:05.227
Jotheb?

26:05.356 --> 26:06.186
A little help?

26:06.315 --> 26:08.101
Help? Of what sort?

26:08.234 --> 26:09.144
Pull.

26:09.277 --> 26:11.484
(grunting)

26:16.242 --> 26:18.574
(grunting)

26:20.830 --> 26:22.366
Pull.

26:24.834 --> 26:27.746
Maybe around the throat
isn't a good idea.

26:29.547 --> 26:31.754
Rygel:
Yes, that's it.

26:32.341 --> 26:33.672
Yes!

26:33.801 --> 26:35.757
( grunting ):
That did it!

26:35.887 --> 26:37.718
I'm free!

26:37.847 --> 26:40.259
(grunting)

26:42.643 --> 26:45.100
Jotheb:
Rygel, look out! Rygel!

26:45.229 --> 26:46.685
No, no, no, don't!

26:46.814 --> 26:49.271
(gasping)

26:49.400 --> 26:50.981
Bekhesh, you're killing him.

26:51.110 --> 26:53.897
Yes, you're right.

26:54.030 --> 26:55.986
(gasping and grunting)

27:11.339 --> 27:12.670
Why was he killed?

27:12.799 --> 27:15.791
Why not? Who'd pay to
get him back?

27:15.927 --> 27:17.758
The Consortium of Trao will.

27:17.887 --> 27:19.718
There's truth to my
words, Bekhesh.

27:19.847 --> 27:21.678
I will prove his value.

27:30.733 --> 27:32.098
(coughing)

27:32.235 --> 27:35.272
The fame of Dominar Rygel has
spread even to my worlds.

27:35.404 --> 27:40.774
If the ransom is not paid by
his people it will be
paid by mine.

27:40.910 --> 27:43.151
(coughing)

27:43.287 --> 27:45.539
I could always kill him again.

27:45.665 --> 27:48.202
(wheezing )

27:52.880 --> 27:54.791
(grunting)

27:57.260 --> 27:59.501
Lie still. You're wiped out.

27:59.637 --> 28:01.002
The gauntlet has drained you.

28:01.138 --> 28:02.218
Oh? You called me a coward.

28:02.348 --> 28:04.259
-You called me a barbarian.
-Well, you are.

28:04.392 --> 28:07.350
Well, perhaps "coward" is too
good a word for a Peacekeeper.

28:07.478 --> 28:10.311
Both of you, knock it off.

28:10.439 --> 28:12.145
You didn't mean what you said.
It was the gauntlet talking.

28:12.275 --> 28:14.436
I meant everything I said.

28:14.569 --> 28:16.184
Yeah, so did I.

28:16.320 --> 28:18.436
You also mean everything
you did?

28:18.573 --> 28:20.859
You attacked us, tried to
take over the ship

28:20.992 --> 28:23.028
and you, you're ready to
slaughter every Tavloid
on the planet anyway.

28:23.160 --> 28:24.195
-Tavlek.
-Tavlek.

28:24.328 --> 28:26.319
Whatever.

28:26.455 --> 28:31.620
The gauntlet brings out the
real you, both of you think
long and hard about therapy.

28:31.752 --> 28:35.210
I'm going to go check things
out. Play nice while I'm gone.

28:38.467 --> 28:40.879
Has the pain ceased?

28:41.012 --> 28:42.627
Hmm...

28:45.224 --> 28:49.843
That stimulant in your
gauntlet, it must have been
extremely addictive.

28:49.979 --> 28:53.597
But once your body purifies
the hunger for the drug
should pass.

28:53.733 --> 28:57.521
Look, I don't need a
damn sermon.

28:57.653 --> 29:03.193
ldidn't ask for your help so
keep your speeches to yourself.

29:03.326 --> 29:06.614
But about the gauntlet,
it's not as if I ever
had any choice.

29:06.746 --> 29:08.111
There are always choices...

29:08.247 --> 29:10.659
Look, I told you, I don't
need a sermon.

29:10.791 --> 29:12.873
All right, no sermons.

29:13.002 --> 29:15.038
What do you need?

29:17.048 --> 29:19.414
Actually, I am a bit hungry.

29:21.093 --> 29:23.345
I hate this.

29:23.930 --> 29:25.170
Does your head hurt?

29:25.306 --> 29:27.171
Yes.

29:27.475 --> 29:28.760
Yours?

29:28.893 --> 29:32.477
Pounding like a Maxzillian
Pilater Day Parade.

29:33.147 --> 29:36.810
I'm so tired.

29:36.943 --> 29:39.104
It took a few hours for me
to fully recover,

29:39.236 --> 29:42.524
so I imagine for a Sebacean we
should probably double that.

29:44.116 --> 29:48.359
Oh, don't be so childish.

29:51.207 --> 29:55.792
Perhaps it took quite a few
hours for me to recover.

29:56.921 --> 29:59.458
Crichton should be back by now.

29:59.590 --> 30:05.631
Well, he's probably at the
wrong end of some Tavlek
weapon somewhere.

30:05.763 --> 30:10.723
Imagine, somewhere out there
there's a whole world
full of Crichtons.

30:10.851 --> 30:13.809
How useless that must be.

30:13.938 --> 30:17.226
It's amazing he could provide
us with some common ground.

30:17.358 --> 30:21.852
Who would have thought there'd
be a race more clumsy and
pathetic than the Luxans.

30:25.825 --> 30:28.066
Ow!

30:28.202 --> 30:30.158
I'm sorry.

30:30.287 --> 30:33.245
You know how clumsy we
Luxans can be.

30:33.374 --> 30:37.287
Jotheb:
Rygel, you're welcomed into the
Consortium of Trao.

30:37.420 --> 30:38.455
Oh, yes.

30:38.587 --> 30:40.999
Well, thank you for the
invitation, but I...

30:41.132 --> 30:42.463
It is not an invitation.

30:42.591 --> 30:45.378
You were killed by Bekhesh
and revived by me.

30:45.511 --> 30:48.924
You are, therefore, owned by
me, as are your subjects.

30:49.056 --> 30:51.513
Is that so?

30:51.642 --> 30:53.553
You're going to pay
my ransom, too?

30:53.686 --> 30:58.271
The expense is small and
billions of Hynerians will be
brought into the consortium.

30:58.399 --> 31:01.391
(laughing)

31:01.527 --> 31:04.234
You multi-throated moron.

31:04.363 --> 31:05.944
I don't have any subjects.

31:06.073 --> 31:07.108
(growling)
How dare you!

31:07.241 --> 31:09.106
l was deposed over a hundred
cycles ago.

31:09.243 --> 31:12.110
Ransom me if you want but
all you'll get is me!

31:12.246 --> 31:14.032
Just you? No subjects?

31:14.165 --> 31:15.655
No. Not a one.

31:15.791 --> 31:20.251
My treacherous bastard of a
cousin stole my throne and
imprisoned me.

31:20.379 --> 31:24.713
l escaped with a few other
fugitives and they're the only
ones who know I'm here!

31:24.842 --> 31:27.174
Won't they ransom you?

31:27.303 --> 31:32.093
They couldn't if they wanted
to, and they don't want to,
because they hate me!

31:32.224 --> 31:33.839
Then you will die here.

31:33.976 --> 31:37.093
So why are you laughing?!

31:39.732 --> 31:43.224
(sobbing)

32:04.048 --> 32:06.915
The camp's pretty deserted.
It looks like most of
them are napping.

32:07.051 --> 32:08.507
Go for it now, or wait
till nightfall?

32:08.636 --> 32:11.093
We don't even know if
this planet rotates.
It may never get dark.

32:11.222 --> 32:13.304
This may be our only chance.
Let's go.

32:13.432 --> 32:15.093
No. You're wiped out.

32:15.226 --> 32:17.717
You stay here. Two's enough.

32:17.853 --> 32:19.138
Well take the gauntlet, then.

32:19.271 --> 32:21.762
No, no, no, no, no.
No, the damn thing's a menace.

32:21.899 --> 32:24.265
Besides, it'd still be one
gauntlet against a whole
camp full of them.

32:24.401 --> 32:27.108
If we can't pull this thing off
without being spotted,
we're screwed.

32:27.238 --> 32:29.354
And what if you are spotted?

32:29.490 --> 32:31.105
Cover our retreat.

32:31.242 --> 32:33.233
Well, with what?

32:33.369 --> 32:35.735
Well, someone blew up
our only weapon.

32:39.166 --> 32:40.155
Take this.

32:40.292 --> 32:42.408
Oh, yes, a sword.

32:42.545 --> 32:43.751
Thank you.

32:43.879 --> 32:45.995
That'll be really helpful.

32:48.509 --> 32:52.218
It is more than just a sword.

32:52.346 --> 32:54.302
(grunting)

33:02.148 --> 33:03.388
is it charged?

33:03.524 --> 33:07.187
It was, when the Peacekeepers
took it from me.

33:07.319 --> 33:09.571
How long ago was that?

33:09.697 --> 33:11.904
Eight cycles.

33:14.034 --> 33:16.616
Ah, this food is horrible.

33:16.745 --> 33:18.360
Almost inedible.

33:18.497 --> 33:19.577
You're welcome.

33:19.707 --> 33:22.198
Thank you for being such a
gracious guest.

33:24.503 --> 33:25.913
What are you?

33:26.046 --> 33:28.662
Older, wiser.

33:28.799 --> 33:31.336
Certainly not as hungry as you.

33:31.468 --> 33:40.058
When I was sick before,
sweating and shaking, you did
that thing where you...

33:41.353 --> 33:42.342
When I kissed you?

33:42.479 --> 33:43.468
No.

33:43.606 --> 33:45.517
Ah, yes.

33:45.649 --> 33:48.106
When you took the pain away.

33:49.236 --> 33:50.772
How did you do that?

33:50.905 --> 33:52.987
I am a Delvian Pa'u.

33:53.115 --> 33:54.821
A priest of the Ninth Level.

33:54.950 --> 33:57.908
We learn to share others' pain.

33:58.621 --> 34:00.157
Tavleks learn how to inflict it.

34:00.289 --> 34:03.156
Yes, I've seen you in action.
Very impressive.

34:03.292 --> 34:05.203
Yes, it was.

34:05.336 --> 34:09.295
We boarded your ship,
stole your king.

34:09.423 --> 34:10.663
l was a part of that.

34:10.799 --> 34:13.256
That is who you are when you
wear the gauntlet.

34:14.678 --> 34:16.464
But perhaps the real you is...

34:16.597 --> 34:19.384
Sick of hearing your plok.

34:20.559 --> 34:23.642
That I know for sure.

34:23.771 --> 34:25.511
Have you ever been through
anything like this before?

34:25.648 --> 34:27.229
Your body being freed
of poisons.

34:27.358 --> 34:28.143
Poison?

34:28.275 --> 34:31.608
This is the only poison
I have in my body.

34:31.737 --> 34:33.477
Why would I want to be free'?

34:33.614 --> 34:38.574
Our gauntlet is our food,
our blood, our life.

34:38.702 --> 34:42.320
It makes us capable of anything.

34:45.042 --> 34:47.408
I know that is what you believe.

34:47.544 --> 34:53.380
But what I wonder is what you
alone are capable of.

35:53.610 --> 35:54.690
(yelling)

35:54.820 --> 35:56.151
Sorry.

35:56.280 --> 35:58.191
Offense is not taken.

35:58.324 --> 36:00.531
Hey, check out the critter.

36:00.659 --> 36:01.990
"Critte r"?

36:02.119 --> 36:03.325
"Critte r"?

36:05.289 --> 36:08.531
D'Argo:
What's your problem?
Find Rygel.

36:18.427 --> 36:19.883
Hey!

36:21.305 --> 36:23.842
It's the scepter, but where
is the crystal?

36:23.974 --> 36:27.637
It's gone, and so is Rygel.

36:27.770 --> 36:29.931
Dominar Rygel?

36:30.064 --> 36:31.179
He was taken away.

36:31.315 --> 36:33.055
To where?

36:33.192 --> 36:36.059
Through my efforts Rygel is
believed to be valuable
by Bekhesh.

36:36.195 --> 36:40.939
Therefore, Rygel is being moved
via shuttle to a more
secure location.

36:41.075 --> 36:44.488
Any more secure, and we'll
never get that crystal back.

36:44.620 --> 36:46.360
Come on, let's get this guy
out of here.

36:46.497 --> 36:48.488
Staying here is my preference.

36:48.624 --> 36:50.489
I am awaiting my release.

36:50.626 --> 36:55.837
Rygel should be informed that
his ransom will not be paid by
the Consortium of Trao.

36:55.964 --> 36:59.832
His presence has been decided
to be too disruptive.

36:59.968 --> 37:01.219
I can dig that.

37:01.345 --> 37:03.176
Fine, I'll tell him.

37:03.305 --> 37:05.341
As you will.

37:08.894 --> 37:11.601
Crichton:
Hi. Uh... Where's Bekhesh?

37:11.730 --> 37:13.231
We came to discuss the
ransom terms.

37:13.357 --> 37:14.346
I think we can reach a deal.

37:14.483 --> 37:15.393
Stand fast.

37:15.526 --> 37:16.936
Right, D'argo?

37:18.028 --> 37:19.484
Mmm...

37:28.580 --> 37:30.241
Go, go, go!

37:41.385 --> 37:42.295
(groaning)

37:51.186 --> 37:52.266
Good work.

37:52.396 --> 37:54.227
That's how you create
a diversion.

37:54.356 --> 37:57.393
It's a fine weapon.

37:57.526 --> 38:00.393
( panting ):
I request that you
bury me with it.

38:01.071 --> 38:02.732
Oh, damn.

38:11.457 --> 38:12.572
Just take it easy.

38:12.708 --> 38:15.245
D'Argo:
The blood, what color is it?

38:15.377 --> 38:17.208
It's, uh...

38:17.337 --> 38:19.464
it's dark red, almost black.

38:19.590 --> 38:21.501
(panting)

38:26.346 --> 38:28.007
What are you doing?

38:28.140 --> 38:30.222
Bleeding freely is the only
thing that will help
heal the Luxan.

38:30.350 --> 38:32.306
The wound isn't cleansed until
the blood flows clear.

38:32.436 --> 38:33.721
D'Argo:
Just do it!

38:33.854 --> 38:35.264
(Aeryn grunts )

38:36.773 --> 38:39.515
(pounding continues)

38:46.450 --> 38:47.280
Tired?

38:47.409 --> 38:48.444
(mumbles)

38:48.577 --> 38:49.942
You need more sleep.

38:50.078 --> 38:52.114
I'll take you back to your
quarters.

38:52.247 --> 38:56.081
Pilot:
Zhaan, you're needed in the
Command. Quickly, please.

38:56.210 --> 38:58.246
I know my way back.

39:09.515 --> 39:14.100
Pilot:
Crichton wants us to scan the
area for any signs of the Tavlek shuttle.

39:20.317 --> 39:23.354
I've picked up a shuttle in
your area. It's priming
for takeoff.

39:23.487 --> 39:25.148
No more than three minutes.

39:25.280 --> 39:26.315
Locaﬂon?

39:26.448 --> 39:29.440
Delta six, pemno nine,
Ierg eight.

39:30.369 --> 39:32.405
Is that anywhere near here?

39:33.705 --> 39:35.366
Directional vector.

39:36.875 --> 39:38.536
(DRD squeaking)

39:45.008 --> 39:46.794
(frantically squeaking )

39:46.927 --> 39:49.134
That young savage!

39:49.263 --> 39:51.174
He's attacked one of the DRDs.

39:51.306 --> 39:52.056
Where?

39:52.182 --> 39:53.968
Maintenance Bay, Lab Section.

39:54.101 --> 39:56.217
Lerg eight there. We're here.

39:56.353 --> 39:59.311
We'll never cover that ground
in three minutes.

39:59.439 --> 40:01.475
You two won't, that's for sure.

40:01.608 --> 40:03.144
Neither can you.

40:03.277 --> 40:06.269
I might, with a little help.

40:06.405 --> 40:09.021
D'Argo:
Oh, no. It's too dangerous.

40:09.157 --> 40:10.533
D'argo's right.

40:10.659 --> 40:11.739
Yeah, yeah, I know. I'm just
nothing but a frail human

40:11.868 --> 40:13.153
but we need that gem,

40:13.287 --> 40:16.779
so unless one of you two's
got a better idea.

40:16.915 --> 40:19.827
Right. So once I get it on,
how do I get it to work?

40:19.960 --> 40:23.293
Itjust, uh... does.

40:23.755 --> 40:24.870
Right.

40:25.007 --> 40:29.797
Willpower, like the Green
Lantern's ring.

40:29.928 --> 40:33.091
( sighing ):
Okay, here goes nothing.

40:33.223 --> 40:34.929
(mechanical swishing)

40:37.436 --> 40:40.974
(swishing continues)

40:41.106 --> 40:43.313
I'm sorry, I... I don't
feel anything.

40:44.276 --> 40:46.733
In fact, I feel pretty good.

40:48.280 --> 40:49.895
Feel real good.

40:50.616 --> 40:52.982
Oh, right.

40:53.118 --> 40:54.528
It's working.

40:58.206 --> 40:59.241
(door opening)

40:59.374 --> 41:01.365
Couldn't sleep?

41:01.501 --> 41:03.162
Give that to me.

41:03.295 --> 41:05.286
I need it! Give it to me!

41:05.422 --> 41:07.458
Is this the way you
repay my help?

41:07.591 --> 41:09.957
How would you like your
arm torn off?

41:10.093 --> 41:11.708
(groaning)

41:11.845 --> 41:13.005
(derisive chuckle)

41:13.138 --> 41:14.344
You don't scare me.

41:14.473 --> 41:17.590
You don't even have the
guts to fight me!

41:18.769 --> 41:19.884
( crackling )

41:20.020 --> 41:21.226
(groaning)

41:21.355 --> 41:22.219
Hear me.

41:22.356 --> 41:25.439
I could rip you apart
right now,

41:25.567 --> 41:27.774
Khalaan help me, I'd enjoy it,

41:27.903 --> 41:29.313
but you know why I don't?

41:29.446 --> 41:31.937
Because we're not enemies.

41:32.074 --> 41:33.359
( groans )

41:33.492 --> 41:36.950
This is your enemy.

41:37.079 --> 41:39.661
Contemplate that in solitude.

41:52.260 --> 41:53.875
Is it running clear?

41:54.012 --> 41:55.843
No, it's still reddish black.

41:55.972 --> 41:57.428
(sighing)

41:57.557 --> 41:59.297
Give it up.

41:59.434 --> 42:03.018
Oh, so you'd die without
putting up a fight.

42:03.146 --> 42:05.228
Then you're the coward.

42:05.357 --> 42:06.016
(pounding)

42:06.149 --> 42:07.855
(groaning)

42:08.610 --> 42:11.898
and you're... the barbarian.

42:12.030 --> 42:15.147
You're going to have to hit it
a lot harder than that

42:15.283 --> 42:16.989
to increase the bleeding.

42:17.119 --> 42:18.279
Hmm.

42:18.412 --> 42:20.494
(pounding)
(groaning)

42:20.622 --> 42:21.782
Again.

42:21.915 --> 42:23.371
(grunting)

42:28.422 --> 42:30.003
Okay, let's see what you got.

42:30.132 --> 42:31.417
(Rygel grumbling)

42:34.094 --> 42:35.550
Freeze!

42:35.679 --> 42:36.668
(groaning)

42:38.890 --> 42:40.426
(groaning)

42:40.559 --> 42:41.389
(snickering )

42:41.518 --> 42:42.633
Rygel:
What's going on?

42:42.769 --> 42:43.519
Who's out there?

42:43.645 --> 42:45.636
Someone answer me!

42:45.772 --> 42:47.387
(Rygel grumbling)

42:50.902 --> 42:52.233
You didn't kill them.

42:52.362 --> 42:55.229
Guess I'm not that
kind of a guy.

42:57.242 --> 42:59.858
Crichton, is that you?
Get me out of here.

42:59.995 --> 43:02.202
Shut up, Rygel.

43:02.330 --> 43:02.989
Hand me the bag.

43:03.123 --> 43:04.329
(Rygel groaning)

43:04.458 --> 43:05.322
Take him.

43:05.459 --> 43:06.448
(groaning)

43:06.585 --> 43:08.576
If you can.

43:09.463 --> 43:11.294
Oh, have it your way.

43:12.424 --> 43:13.334
(groaning)

43:14.843 --> 43:16.049
(snickering )

43:16.178 --> 43:18.385
Fool. You'll have to do
better than that.

43:18.513 --> 43:19.298
(swishing)

43:19.431 --> 43:21.171
Just watch me.

43:21.308 --> 43:22.639
(whirring )

43:27.314 --> 43:28.679
(sighs)

43:30.567 --> 43:33.434
( clears throat)

43:33.570 --> 43:36.937
Hey, Bekhesh, how about we
call this thing a draw?

43:38.241 --> 43:39.697
You don't really want
Rygel anyway.

43:39.826 --> 43:41.111
Why don't I?

43:41.244 --> 43:43.360
Because, uh, he's not
really a king.

43:43.497 --> 43:44.236
I'm not?

43:44.372 --> 43:45.748
He's not?

43:45.874 --> 43:47.660
He's an escaped mental patient;
delusions of royalty.

43:47.793 --> 43:51.251
You're the mental patient if
you expect anybody'd to
believe that I...

43:51.379 --> 43:52.414
Oh!

43:54.341 --> 43:55.205
He's not insane.

43:55.342 --> 43:56.798
I could be.

43:56.927 --> 44:00.761
Okay, right, yeah. No, he's not
insane, but, uh, he is sick.

44:00.889 --> 44:02.845
(coughing)

44:02.974 --> 44:04.475
He's very sick.

44:04.601 --> 44:07.013
Very contagious.

44:07.145 --> 44:08.681
You ever hear of chicken pox?

44:08.814 --> 44:10.304
He's not sick.

44:10.440 --> 44:12.817
Right, he's not sick, but he...

44:12.943 --> 44:15.184
but he is worthless.

44:15.320 --> 44:18.187
No one is going to pay
his ransom.

44:18.323 --> 44:20.905
The Consortium of Trao will.

44:21.034 --> 44:21.989
No...

44:22.118 --> 44:24.109
they won't.

44:24.246 --> 44:26.532
I just talked to your other
prisoner the four-throated cat?

44:26.665 --> 44:28.451
They're not going to do it.
What, do you blame them?

44:28.583 --> 44:32.792
Rygel is an obnoxious gas-bag
and who's going to shell
out for that?

44:32.921 --> 44:36.129
He's right. I'm unloved,
unwanted, unpopular...

44:36.258 --> 44:38.089
(weakly):
unconscious.

44:38.218 --> 44:40.709
Look, Bekhesh, we couldn't pay
your ransom if we wanted to.

44:40.846 --> 44:43.758
Rygel lied to impress you.

44:43.890 --> 44:45.721
We got nothing.

44:45.851 --> 44:47.182
No corvinium?

44:47.310 --> 44:52.805
No corvinium, no gold,
no jewels, no munitions.

44:52.941 --> 44:56.433
You don't believe me call my
ship.

44:57.320 --> 44:59.436
Talk to your boy.

45:00.699 --> 45:03.315
Your leader wishes to
speak with you.

45:03.451 --> 45:04.782
( beeping )

45:07.414 --> 45:08.199
Bekhesh.

45:08.331 --> 45:09.741
You've spent time with them.

45:09.875 --> 45:12.617
Tell me, are they wealthy?

45:12.752 --> 45:15.744
Have you seen any
riches onboard?

45:18.174 --> 45:19.675
I won't lie for you.

45:20.760 --> 45:22.546
No one's asked you to.

45:24.139 --> 45:26.425
I've seen much of their ship.

45:26.558 --> 45:28.139
It's pathetic.

45:28.268 --> 45:30.930
They have no riches and all they
have to eat is food cubes.

45:31.062 --> 45:33.769
Are they forcing you
to say that?

45:33.899 --> 45:35.685
If they mistreated you
in any way?

45:35.817 --> 45:41.312
You just say the word, and I'll
re-take their ship and
slaughter the lot of them.

45:44.659 --> 45:46.775
No, they haven't mistreated me.

45:46.912 --> 45:49.449
In fact, they've been trying
to help me.

45:49.581 --> 45:52.118
Help you? Why?

45:52.250 --> 45:54.491
I don't really know.

45:54.628 --> 45:55.993
( beeps )

45:57.547 --> 46:00.459
Perhaps I like to
offer choices.

46:07.390 --> 46:10.006
Suppose I still don't
believe you?

46:10.143 --> 46:16.389
Then you might as well shoot us
all because I've told you
the truth.

46:19.444 --> 46:23.983
It's been so long since
anyone's told me the truth,

46:24.115 --> 46:27.323
I don't recognize it anymore.

46:33.291 --> 46:35.873
(Rygel whimpering)

46:36.002 --> 46:38.960
Take this royal pain
out of my sight.

46:39.089 --> 46:40.795
( Rygel screaming )

46:45.428 --> 46:47.089
(Rygel groaning)

46:47.222 --> 46:48.428
(coughing)

46:48.556 --> 46:49.841
Where's the you-know-what?

46:49.975 --> 46:53.308
I knew you wouldn't come
back just for me.

46:53.436 --> 46:55.222
What'd you do with it?

46:55.355 --> 46:57.562
It's safe and sound.

46:59.150 --> 47:00.139
Did you swallow it?!

47:00.276 --> 47:02.483
Swallow it? Yes, yes.

47:02.612 --> 47:05.103
Which means you're going to
have to take me back as I am

47:05.240 --> 47:08.107
or disembowel me here.

47:09.119 --> 47:11.110
Don't you tempt me, fluffy.

47:11.246 --> 47:12.281
Whoa...

47:14.749 --> 47:16.705
( exhausted ):
Well...

47:16.835 --> 47:18.871
am I to live or die?

47:19.004 --> 47:21.245
Die...

47:21.381 --> 47:23.212
but not today.

47:23.341 --> 47:24.251
Rygel:
Hurry up, Crichton.

47:24.384 --> 47:27.296
Crichton:
Shut up, Rygel.

47:27.429 --> 47:29.169
(Rygel grumbling)

47:32.350 --> 47:33.886
Piece of cake.

47:34.019 --> 47:35.304
(groaning)

47:35.437 --> 47:36.597
(Rygel yelling)

47:36.730 --> 47:39.346
(Rygel coughing, groaning)

47:47.157 --> 47:49.193
( Rygel grunting )

47:49.325 --> 47:51.532
Rygel, hurry up.

47:51.661 --> 47:53.367
Rygel:
You can come in if you want to.

47:53.496 --> 47:56.203
No! No, you, uh...

47:56.332 --> 47:59.620
you just, uh, get a move on.

47:59.753 --> 48:03.416
(Rygel grunting, spits loudly)

48:03.548 --> 48:05.413
Rygel:
Well, I don't see why
you're so upset.

48:05.550 --> 48:09.714
I would have put it right back
if those savages hadn't
kidnapped me.

48:14.059 --> 48:16.516
I did wash it.

48:19.689 --> 48:21.896
Well, I think I did.

48:22.025 --> 48:25.392
(humming mischievously)

48:32.202 --> 48:34.614
(screen whirring )

48:34.746 --> 48:36.156
Curious how you're doing.

48:36.289 --> 48:37.745
Kyr:
Much better

48:37.874 --> 48:41.662
now that I have the
gauntlet back on.

48:42.378 --> 48:44.289
My choice.

48:48.343 --> 48:49.674
(whirring )

48:54.057 --> 48:56.093
No sermons.
