00:46.159 --> 00:50.091
Have you ever
seen anything so beautiful?

00:50.253 --> 00:51.934
We'll get out there soon.

00:52.535 --> 00:54.543
I just wish my dad
would let me get out

00:54.611 --> 00:56.749
and see the real world.

00:56.826 --> 00:58.883
This is where they
found the miracle flower

00:58.975 --> 01:00.496
that saved your mom.

01:00.573 --> 01:02.486
- What are they?
- Don't know.

01:02.563 --> 01:03.864
They're unbreakable.

01:06.803 --> 01:09.633
You touched a mysterious rock

01:09.710 --> 01:12.182
that somehow caused
your hair to return.

01:12.259 --> 01:14.666
We once tried to double
cross this guy called The Baron.

01:14.743 --> 01:16.355
He hasn't stopped
hunting us since.

01:16.432 --> 01:17.922
Of course, it didn't
help matters

01:17.999 --> 01:20.272
that Eugene stole
his prized stallion.

01:20.349 --> 01:22.677
<i>Those black rocks
are actually some kind of...</i>

01:22.754 --> 01:24.395
<i>Of ancient darkness.</i>

01:24.472 --> 01:27.497
<i>These rocks hold
a secret, and somehow,</i>

01:27.753 --> 01:29.466
<i>I'm connected to it.</i>

01:30.050 --> 01:32.653
<i>I can see now that
they're pointing in a direction.</i>

01:32.762 --> 01:34.732
<i>Pointing you in a direction.</i>

01:34.870 --> 01:38.380
<i>It's like the rocks
want us to follow them.</i>

02:57.222 --> 03:00.934

Well, uh, let's see.

04:38.472 --> 04:40.968
Excited? To follow
a bunch of creepy rocks?

Try not to run off like that.

05:34.543 --> 05:36.199
Not that I don't think
you can handle yourself,

05:36.276 --> 05:38.170
but I promised your dad
I'd keep you safe,

05:38.247 --> 05:40.681
and I'd hate to lose you
less than a week on the road.

05:40.758 --> 05:42.555
Has it been
that long already?

05:42.632 --> 05:45.378
You've got to exercise at least
some caution out here.

05:45.455 --> 05:48.465
Trust me, Raps. The real world
isn't all fun and games.

05:48.542 --> 05:51.276
Next stop: Vardaros!

05:51.353 --> 05:53.444
City of fun and games!

05:54.145 --> 05:57.397
I am so glad we decided
to bring those two along.

05:57.474 --> 05:58.895
Oh, come on, Cass!

is a new thing for you.

Come on, Pascal!

06:05.386 --> 06:08.626

06:52.088 --> 06:53.960
Not that you shouldn't
trust the endorsement

06:54.037 --> 06:56.331
of three lifetime
criminals, Raps,

06:56.408 --> 06:58.708
but maybe you should
trust me, too.

06:58.900 --> 07:00.921
I just want to make sure
that we're not losing sight

07:00.998 --> 07:02.464
of what we're doing out here.

07:02.628 --> 07:04.931
I know!
Believe me, Cass.

07:05.008 --> 07:07.471
I want answers
more than anyone.

07:07.651 --> 07:11.326
I feel like whatever is waiting
for us at the end of this road,

07:11.403 --> 07:14.145
is only part of why
we're out here.

07:20.538 --> 07:22.162
Alright, boys,
we're gonna try

07:22.239 --> 07:23.752
this proposal thing
one more time,

07:23.829 --> 07:25.815
and where better
than Vardaros?

07:25.892 --> 07:28.838
One of the most beautiful cities
in the world. It's perfect!

07:28.915 --> 07:31.348
Didn't she say "no"
the first time you proposed?

07:32.311 --> 07:33.605
I'm just sayin'.

07:33.682 --> 07:35.973
You probably thought that
was gonna be perfect, too.

07:36.440 --> 07:38.535
Thank you, Lance.

07:38.612 --> 07:40.598
It makes
perfect sense to me!

07:40.675 --> 07:42.722
The princess is out
in the free world

07:42.799 --> 07:44.385
for the first time
in her life!

07:44.462 --> 07:46.628
I'm sure she's just
itchin' to settle down

07:46.705 --> 07:48.268
with you!

07:49.594 --> 07:50.868
We're here.

07:50.945 --> 07:53.546
Woohoo! I'm gonna
find a picnic spot!

07:53.623 --> 07:56.095
No way! You got
to choose last time,

07:56.172 --> 07:58.070
and there were ants
all over the place!

07:58.147 --> 08:00.293
Come on, Fitzherbert,
forget Hookfoot!

08:00.370 --> 08:01.329
Forget Lance!

08:01.406 --> 08:03.628
This is Rapunzel
we're talking about.

08:03.705 --> 08:05.827
Of course, she wants
to get married.

08:05.904 --> 08:07.967
Besides, I'm not
asking her to settle down

08:08.044 --> 08:09.176
and throw her life away.

08:09.253 --> 08:10.908
I'm just asking her to...

08:11.351 --> 08:12.395
settle down.

08:12.472 --> 08:13.628
Okay, enough already!

08:13.705 --> 08:15.978
You just have to
ask her flat out!

08:16.253 --> 08:17.426
Rapunzel...

08:17.503 --> 08:19.280
Will you...

08:44.020 --> 08:47.202
Eugene, did you just
ask me to marry you?

08:47.279 --> 08:48.855
What?! Ha ha!

08:48.932 --> 08:50.662
No! That's crazy!

08:50.739 --> 08:52.082
No, I just...
I dropped something.

08:52.159 --> 08:53.261
- Uh...
- And I got it.

08:53.338 --> 08:55.705
That... that something that I dropped,
and I knelt down and I picked it up,

08:55.782 --> 08:57.658
which would explain
why I was on one knee.

08:57.735 --> 08:59.561
I can see how you
would, uh...

08:59.816 --> 09:02.475
- You know.
- I thought I heard you say "marry me."

09:02.558 --> 09:04.185
Oh, I see now!

09:04.262 --> 09:05.134
There's the confusion,

09:05.211 --> 09:06.423
because I didn't
say "marry me."

09:06.500 --> 09:08.412
I said, "Laramie."

09:08.489 --> 09:10.816
Uh, I was talking about
my old dog, Laramie.

09:10.893 --> 09:13.322
You were talking about
your old dog, Laramie?

09:13.399 --> 09:14.579
To yourself?

09:14.722 --> 09:16.673
Yep! Good ole scruffy,
totally real,

09:16.750 --> 09:18.507
and totally not
made up, Laramie!

09:21.878 --> 09:23.827
Okay, Cass! Cass!
Are you okay?

09:23.918 --> 09:25.220
We heard a scream!

09:25.297 --> 09:26.803
That wasn't me.

09:32.377 --> 09:34.416
- Shorty?!
- How did you get here?

09:34.493 --> 09:35.882
How indeed!

09:35.959 --> 09:37.616
The circumstances
which lead

09:37.693 --> 09:40.228
to my unexpected
departure from Corona,

09:40.305 --> 09:43.483
make for a long,
yet fascinating, tale.

09:43.560 --> 09:45.403
Bottom line us, beardy.

09:45.552 --> 09:47.631
I fell asleep in a food trunk.

09:47.770 --> 09:49.475
Huh? No, no, no, no, no!

09:49.552 --> 09:51.152
The food! He ate all the food!

09:51.229 --> 09:52.303
The bread! The cheese!

09:52.380 --> 09:54.556
Those little cocktail wienies
in the peppercorn jelly.

09:54.633 --> 09:56.019
Gone! All gone!

09:56.096 --> 09:57.855
Why? Why?!

09:57.932 --> 09:59.366
You're a monster.

09:59.448 --> 10:00.949
<i>This is the worst day...</i>

10:01.026 --> 10:02.838
Well, I guess someone
should head into town

10:02.915 --> 10:04.189
and pick up more supplies.

10:04.266 --> 10:07.192
- Anyone up for a walk?
- Um, I'll go.

10:07.328 --> 10:09.788
- If that's okay.
- Sure!

10:09.932 --> 10:12.199
I mean, if you want
to go for a walk,

10:12.276 --> 10:14.303
you don't need
to feel pressured.

10:14.380 --> 10:16.515
No, no. I...
I won't.

10:16.592 --> 10:20.249
But just to be clear, I didn't
officially ask you to go for a walk.

10:20.338 --> 10:21.685
Okay,

10:21.762 --> 10:24.426
but the question
was still out there.

10:24.503 --> 10:26.425
- Doesn't that count?
- That depends.

10:26.502 --> 10:28.671
Are you officially
asking me if it counts?

10:28.789 --> 10:30.555
Would that
change your answer?

10:30.632 --> 10:32.168
I don't know.
Would it change yours?

10:32.245 --> 10:33.765
A question's a question.

10:33.842 --> 10:36.355
The answer should be
the same either way.

10:36.432 --> 10:38.168
Yeah, now,
I'm confused, Rapunzel.

10:38.245 --> 10:40.342
Do you want to go
for a walk or not?

10:41.455 --> 10:42.928
Do you want to go
for a walk?

10:43.005 --> 10:44.628
Guys, I can't take any more!
Enough!

10:44.705 --> 10:45.886
No one's going for a walk!

10:45.963 --> 10:47.600
Let's just take
the caravan into town!

10:47.677 --> 10:48.739
Together!

11:02.150 --> 11:03.671
Here we are.

11:05.580 --> 11:08.569
Vardaros! Here we...

11:08.651 --> 11:10.824
Oh! Uh...

11:10.980 --> 11:12.544
Ew.

11:12.712 --> 11:15.011
Wow, guys!
You were right!

11:15.079 --> 11:16.165
This is great!

11:16.233 --> 11:17.339
What do you wanna do first?

11:17.407 --> 11:19.003
Get matching face tattoos?

11:20.012 --> 11:22.724
Or see if we can get a deal
on a rusty hatchet?

11:22.801 --> 11:24.460
Oh, I know!

11:24.537 --> 11:26.866
Let's see who can
catch the plague first!

11:26.943 --> 11:28.423
I don't understand!

11:28.500 --> 11:29.615
What happened?

11:29.692 --> 11:31.055
Come on, guys!

11:31.132 --> 11:33.648
Maybe it's not exactly
how you remembered it,

11:33.725 --> 11:36.463
but that doesn't mean
it's not a fun-loving city!

11:36.571 --> 11:37.869
Hello, there!

11:37.946 --> 11:40.862
We're new in town. My
name's... -Get lost.

11:41.032 --> 11:43.637
Maybe you should hold off
on the introductions.

11:43.714 --> 11:45.128
Something tells me
if word got out

11:45.205 --> 11:47.225
that actual royalty
were in town,

11:47.302 --> 11:48.315
we could be in trouble.

11:48.392 --> 11:50.271
You know, I hate saying this,
but she's right.

11:50.348 --> 11:51.984
Let's keep a lower
profile, princess.

11:52.061 --> 11:53.218
We'll go get the supplies.

11:53.295 --> 11:55.535
You guys take the caravan
back up to the camp.

11:55.612 --> 11:57.892
The last thing you need is
for someone to recognize you.

11:58.824 --> 12:01.154
I recognize that guy.

12:04.199 --> 12:06.659
Spread the word.
Flynn Rider's in town.

12:09.087 --> 12:10.456
Flynn Rider's in town.

12:10.548 --> 12:11.975
Hey! Flynn Rider.

12:12.052 --> 12:13.347
Flynn Rider's in town.

12:13.424 --> 12:15.063
- Flynn Rider.
- It's Flynn Rider.

12:15.140 --> 12:17.022
- Flynn Rider.
- Flynn Rider's in town.

12:17.099 --> 12:18.569
Flynn Rider?

12:18.728 --> 12:20.715
Here in Vardaros?

12:20.798 --> 12:22.501
Yes, Baron.

12:22.578 --> 12:25.644
And he's with his friends
from Corona.

12:28.012 --> 12:29.699
Let me dispose of him.

12:29.776 --> 12:32.254
- Please!
- Baron: No.

12:32.471 --> 12:34.008
That's not how this ends.

12:34.085 --> 12:37.168
Bring me the man who
stole my precious stallion.

12:37.245 --> 12:40.116
I want to settle things
with Rider.

12:40.193 --> 12:41.410
Properly.

12:55.381 --> 12:57.426
He asked you
to marry him again, huh?

12:59.330 --> 13:00.623
Come on!

13:00.700 --> 13:02.584
I know you guys
well enough by now!

13:02.661 --> 13:05.725
I-I guess he maybe asked me.

13:05.802 --> 13:08.587
Well? What did you maybe say?

13:08.664 --> 13:10.327
I didn't say anything.

13:10.404 --> 13:12.612
And I'm not sure why.

13:12.689 --> 13:14.639
Oh, I can tell you why.

13:17.762 --> 13:20.215
You have bigger things
lying ahead of you.

13:22.682 --> 13:24.072
Greetings.

13:24.556 --> 13:26.897
I told you she was
gonna say "no."

13:26.974 --> 13:28.185
She wasn't ready!

13:28.262 --> 13:31.283
For the last time,
she didn't say "no," Hookfoot.

13:31.360 --> 13:32.949
She didn't say anything.

13:33.342 --> 13:35.358
Which, in a way, is kind
of worse than saying no,

13:35.435 --> 13:37.680
so I'd appreciate it, if you'd
just change the subject.

13:37.757 --> 13:38.884
You got it, pal.

13:38.961 --> 13:41.528
- I'm not gonna say another word.
- Thank you!

13:43.885 --> 13:45.428
Hey! Here's a fun fact.

13:45.505 --> 13:47.602
Rapunzel's agreed
to marry me

13:47.679 --> 13:49.746
as many times as
she's agreed to marry you!

13:49.823 --> 13:51.789
And I didn't even
have to ask... -

13:51.918 --> 13:53.660
Now, that's enough, Hookfoot!

13:53.737 --> 13:54.785
Eugene's in pain.

13:54.862 --> 13:56.886
It's not his fault
he couldn't see

13:56.963 --> 13:59.972
that asking a girl who is free
for the first time in her life,

14:00.049 --> 14:01.749
to clip her wings
and get hitched,

14:01.826 --> 14:03.719
would be a horrible idea,

14:03.796 --> 14:05.761
but Eugene
is still our friend!

14:05.838 --> 14:07.185
And we should stick by him,

14:07.262 --> 14:09.142
- no matter how oblivious or...
- Desperate!

14:09.219 --> 14:12.082
- Yeah.
- Downright pathetic he comes across.

14:12.182 --> 14:14.121
Isn't that right, buddy?

14:16.682 --> 14:18.928
You are all just
awful, awful people.

14:19.005 --> 14:21.097
Vex:
Hey! You!

14:21.635 --> 14:24.575
You guys are friends with that annoying
girl with the long hair, right?

14:24.652 --> 14:27.332
Hey, hey! Easy! That happens
to be the woman I love.

14:27.409 --> 14:28.608
And she's not annoying!

14:28.685 --> 14:31.361
We like to use
the term "irrepressible."

14:31.455 --> 14:33.676
No! She's in trouble.

14:33.791 --> 14:35.441
You better come with me.

14:42.576 --> 14:43.935
Where is she?

14:44.012 --> 14:45.063
How should I know?

14:45.140 --> 14:46.779
Some guy just gave me
a sliver of gold

14:46.856 --> 14:48.379
to get you to come
down here.

14:48.541 --> 14:50.754
Hello, Rider.

14:53.722 --> 14:56.800
Hoo! Anthony,
The Weasel.

14:56.877 --> 14:58.878
See, I knew it was you
before I even turned around!

14:58.955 --> 15:00.762
Must be standing downwind.

15:03.716 --> 15:04.791
Oof!

15:04.928 --> 15:07.141
And I thought I was
a big, ugly goon!

15:07.302 --> 15:10.465
An old friend would like to do
some catching up with you.

15:13.509 --> 15:16.194
I'm sorry,
who are you, exactly?

15:16.271 --> 15:17.913
Oh, right, sorry!

15:17.990 --> 15:21.293
Princess Rapunzel,
my name is Adira.

15:21.471 --> 15:23.561
And what do you want, Adira?

15:23.638 --> 15:27.032
A word with Rapunzel
is all... alone.

15:27.109 --> 15:28.824
If you don't mind.

15:29.174 --> 15:30.555
Not gonna happen.

15:30.632 --> 15:32.049
Just a second, Cass.

15:32.126 --> 15:34.144
Let's hear her out.

15:34.392 --> 15:36.680
Okay, I gotta be honest.

15:36.757 --> 15:37.987
I know we just met,

15:38.064 --> 15:41.306
but, uh, I'm not a big fan
of people touching me.

15:41.383 --> 15:44.816
And I'm not a fan of people
who lurk in the shadows.

15:44.968 --> 15:48.371
Okay, last chance
to do this the nice way.

15:50.049 --> 15:51.819
And where's the fun in that?

15:51.896 --> 15:54.418
Cass, no! Wait.

16:02.307 --> 16:03.315
Hey!

16:03.392 --> 16:05.008
I don't know who you are,

16:05.085 --> 16:08.582
but you do not get
to do that to my best friend!

16:13.097 --> 16:14.551
Alright, then.

16:20.512 --> 16:21.783
Whoa!

16:22.783 --> 16:25.457
Let's try that again, weirdo.

16:27.135 --> 16:28.272
I'm not a weirdo.

16:28.349 --> 16:30.338
Am I?
Eccentric, maybe.

16:30.415 --> 16:31.735
Unconventional, sure,

16:31.812 --> 16:33.769
but weirdo?

16:38.660 --> 16:41.543
Oh, come on, guys.
This is ridiculous.

16:41.775 --> 16:43.527
I don't wanna fight you.

16:44.714 --> 16:46.699
You could've fooled me.

16:50.317 --> 16:52.433
You guys aren't even trying.

16:55.010 --> 16:57.069
Oh, wait. They are trying.

16:57.146 --> 16:58.822
That's it!

16:59.015 --> 17:01.002
Huh? Huh?

17:11.752 --> 17:13.292
Enough!

17:16.182 --> 17:19.472
Yeah, see, I thought
we covered this.

17:19.549 --> 17:22.012
I don't like being touched!

17:28.306 --> 17:30.667
- Huh?
- It didn't cut.

17:30.744 --> 17:32.896
It didn't break.

17:32.973 --> 17:34.766
It must be made of...

17:34.843 --> 17:36.887
Princess! Cass!

17:37.329 --> 17:38.517
Hookfoot!

17:38.660 --> 17:41.363
Are you okay? -Adira: I can
see you have your hands full.

17:41.461 --> 17:43.066
I'll seek you out later.

17:45.080 --> 17:46.777
I fought as hard as I could,

17:46.854 --> 17:48.762
and... barely got away alive!

17:48.846 --> 17:50.716
Wait, wait?
Fought? Fought who?

17:50.793 --> 17:52.152
Where's Eugene?

17:52.869 --> 17:54.668
I'm so sorry.

17:54.871 --> 17:57.512
Eugene... they took him.

18:21.658 --> 18:22.769
It's the...

18:22.846 --> 18:25.352
- Oh, it's... it's the...
- Baron!

18:25.429 --> 18:28.183
Haha! Long time, no see.

18:28.262 --> 18:30.855
I'm glad to see you've set up
shop here in Vardaros now.

18:30.932 --> 18:33.548
In fact, we were just admiring
what you've done with the place.

18:33.625 --> 18:35.014
If you'd like to keep
your tongue,

18:35.091 --> 18:37.824
I suggest you stop
moving it now.

18:38.094 --> 18:40.363
Anthony, enough.

18:41.674 --> 18:43.410
Quit playing games, Rider.

18:43.552 --> 18:45.691
I've been waiting
for this moment.

18:45.804 --> 18:47.519
It's time to make amends

18:47.693 --> 18:49.584
for what you did
to my Stalyan.

18:49.661 --> 18:51.175
Oh, right!

18:51.252 --> 18:52.347
The Stalyan Incident.

18:52.424 --> 18:54.852
You really should let
this whole Stalyan thing go.

18:54.929 --> 18:56.506
Come on! I mean,
it's ancient history.

18:56.583 --> 18:58.407
Let's all just move on.

18:58.484 --> 19:00.002
Let's not.

19:05.098 --> 19:06.558
Hello, Stalyan.

19:10.525 --> 19:12.762
Hello, Rider.

19:17.676 --> 19:19.326
I'm so confused.

19:19.403 --> 19:20.984
Stalyan is
the Baron's daughter.

19:21.061 --> 19:22.146
And Eugene's ex.

19:22.223 --> 19:23.783
I see!

19:23.997 --> 19:25.964
And who's this
Eugene guy?

19:26.049 --> 19:28.555
Hey! Stalyan!

19:28.632 --> 19:31.652
How are ya? Uh, look, before you
get too upset, I can explain.

19:31.729 --> 19:33.269
Oh, I'm not upset, Rider,

19:33.346 --> 19:35.040
besides, what's to explain?

19:35.117 --> 19:36.844
You left me at the altar!

19:36.921 --> 19:38.968
Did I? Did I... do that?

19:39.045 --> 19:40.244
Is that how it went down?

19:40.321 --> 19:41.724
Because that's not
how I remember it!

19:41.801 --> 19:42.990
But hey, you know, it was...

19:43.067 --> 19:44.785
It was quite some time ago.

19:44.862 --> 19:46.465
Who's to say who
did what that day?

19:46.542 --> 19:48.159
- I mean...
- Stop talking.

19:48.950 --> 19:51.826
After what you did, I swore
that if I ever saw you again,

19:51.903 --> 19:53.937
I would break a lot of bones.

19:54.014 --> 19:55.031
Fair, fair.

19:55.108 --> 19:56.880
We're talking about
my bones, is that correct?

19:56.957 --> 19:59.332
But with time
comes perspective.

19:59.432 --> 20:02.508
I realized that we were meant
for each other, Flynn Rider.

20:02.585 --> 20:04.082
Partners in crime.

20:04.159 --> 20:05.555
Partners in life.

20:05.632 --> 20:07.735
We can't change
what we are.

20:07.812 --> 20:09.839
Wait, what?
What are you talking about?

20:09.916 --> 20:12.083
I'm making you
a proposition, Rider.

20:12.160 --> 20:15.073
Keep good on the promise
you made to my daughter,

20:15.168 --> 20:16.456
and marry her.

20:16.533 --> 20:18.030
Waiting for the "or."

20:18.107 --> 20:22.746
Or you, Strongbow
and your pet troll

20:22.823 --> 20:24.287
will perish.

20:24.598 --> 20:25.941
Painfully.

20:26.166 --> 20:29.569
You can't make
me marry her, Baron!

20:29.646 --> 20:32.944
Oh, I'd like to give it a try.

20:33.021 --> 20:34.400
It's a spider. Eugene!

20:34.477 --> 20:35.908
Eugene, it's a spider.

20:35.985 --> 20:38.413
You know I hate spiders.

20:39.270 --> 20:40.952
Not just any spider.

20:41.029 --> 20:43.420
It's a venomous Kai spider.

20:43.497 --> 20:46.256
Its bite causes fever
and delirium.

20:46.333 --> 20:49.433
Only when there's swelling
of the tongue and throat,

20:49.510 --> 20:51.499
do you know the end is near.

20:54.629 --> 20:56.449
Spiders bite.
He's on me! He's on me!

20:56.526 --> 20:59.590
He's walking! He's walking!
He's on my hand! He's... ow!

21:00.042 --> 21:02.015
No! Is he dead?

21:02.092 --> 21:05.850
No. The half-wit
passed out from fear.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.582
He's right.
That's exactly what happened.

21:07.659 --> 21:10.858
But he will be
dead by nightfall.

21:11.168 --> 21:14.448
Unless, of course,
you have this.

21:14.525 --> 21:15.680
The anti-venom.

21:15.757 --> 21:20.395
Marry Stalyan, and this will be
your wedding present from me.

21:21.232 --> 21:23.077
Trust me, Rider.

21:23.154 --> 21:24.904
It's meant to be.

21:27.865 --> 21:31.015
Congratulations, Mr. Groom.

21:33.842 --> 21:37.007
Somebody somewhere
has to know who took Eugene.

21:37.099 --> 21:39.624
We'll cover more ground
if we split up.

22:05.707 --> 22:07.538
No one wants to talk!

22:08.576 --> 22:09.928
Look, Raps,

22:10.005 --> 22:11.327
we've been at this
for hours.

22:11.404 --> 22:12.823
Maybe we should
go back to Corona

22:12.900 --> 22:14.054
and send for the cavalry.

22:14.131 --> 22:16.207
If we leave now,
we can be back in two wee...

22:16.284 --> 22:19.327
Oh! You're right!
I'm so sorry!

22:19.404 --> 22:20.878
Please stop
looking at me like that.

22:20.955 --> 22:23.604
What's the matter, Princess?

22:23.681 --> 22:26.227
Looking for your boyfriend?

22:26.760 --> 22:28.354
You!

22:32.198 --> 22:33.782
You know something!

22:33.859 --> 22:35.176
What do you know?

22:35.253 --> 22:37.392
Tell me now,
or so help me!

22:37.469 --> 22:40.249
I don't need
to tell you nothing!

22:55.216 --> 22:59.593
Alright! Shut your faces
and listen up, you scum.

22:59.677 --> 23:02.046
Hey! That's the guy
that attacked us.

23:02.123 --> 23:05.242
The Baron has something
he'd like to say.

23:06.019 --> 23:08.218
"The Baron" Baron?

23:08.932 --> 23:10.812
People of Vardaros,

23:10.962 --> 23:13.734
I bring you cause
for celebration.

23:13.968 --> 23:15.460
A glint of joy

23:15.537 --> 23:19.132
into your otherwise
meaningless and pitiful lives.

23:20.630 --> 23:22.955
Baron: My people will
be collecting gifts

23:23.032 --> 23:26.273
for the occasion.
From each of you.

23:26.974 --> 23:28.395
Hang in there, buddy.

23:28.654 --> 23:30.390
I'm gonna get you
outta this.

23:30.708 --> 23:31.927
Wow!

23:32.059 --> 23:34.315
You should see all
the people out there!

23:34.392 --> 23:36.185
Stalyan, come on.
This is stupid.

23:36.262 --> 23:38.838
I know it is. I told my dad
the spider wasn't necessary,

23:38.915 --> 23:40.223
but you know bad guys.

23:40.300 --> 23:41.718
They have such
a flair for drama.

23:41.795 --> 23:43.342
That's not what I meant!

23:43.419 --> 23:44.645
I know what you meant.

23:44.722 --> 23:46.506
Stalyan, I can't do this.

23:46.583 --> 23:47.968
I'm in love
with someone else.

23:48.045 --> 23:49.315
Yeah, I know.

23:49.392 --> 23:51.420
We've all heard
the story by now.

23:51.497 --> 23:53.540
How the daring,
ne'er do well thief

23:53.617 --> 23:56.048
rescued the lost princess
from her tower.

23:56.125 --> 23:57.185
Let me ask you.

23:57.262 --> 23:59.681
Do you really think
it's fair to ask a girl

23:59.758 --> 24:02.579
who spent the first
18 years of her life in prison

24:02.656 --> 24:05.697
to give up her freedom
for a lifelong relationship

24:05.774 --> 24:08.173
with someone like you?

24:11.691 --> 24:13.718
Baron:
I am pleased to announce

24:13.795 --> 24:16.341
the re-engagement
of my daughter,

24:16.418 --> 24:17.593
Stalyan.

24:18.144 --> 24:20.463
Wait. The Baron's daughter?

24:20.547 --> 24:22.128
Oh! What a daughter!

24:22.205 --> 24:23.916
And her fiancé,

24:23.993 --> 24:25.370
Flynn Rider.

24:25.748 --> 24:27.444
Huh?

24:35.146 --> 24:36.436
Eugene!

24:37.976 --> 24:39.015
Rapunzel.

24:39.092 --> 24:41.722
Eugene, I don't understand.

24:41.799 --> 24:43.342
What's going on?

24:44.842 --> 24:46.145
Rapunzel, I...

24:46.222 --> 24:47.270
He's with us now.

24:47.347 --> 24:49.650
This is some
kind of joke, right?

24:53.429 --> 24:54.984
I, uh...

24:55.562 --> 24:58.312
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry, Rapunzel,

24:58.389 --> 25:00.059
but I've made my choice.

25:01.429 --> 25:03.062
Eugene?

25:03.396 --> 25:05.146
Eugene!

25:08.452 --> 25:09.726
Eugene.

25:14.994 --> 25:18.094
Your nose. It
looks like a strawberry.

25:18.171 --> 25:20.171
You know,
speaking of strawberry...

25:20.248 --> 25:21.325
I get the berry part.

25:21.402 --> 25:23.520
That part makes
perfect sense, but what?!

25:23.597 --> 25:25.830
Where does the "straw" come in?

25:25.907 --> 25:27.956
They should call it noseberry.

25:28.033 --> 25:29.902
Cause it looks like your nose.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.931
I'm gonna eat your nose.

25:33.973 --> 25:35.264
How's he doing, Shorty?

25:35.341 --> 25:37.072
He's doing great!

25:39.262 --> 25:40.815
Lance, buddy,

25:40.892 --> 25:42.145
just hang on, alright?

25:42.222 --> 25:43.332
I'm gonna get you
that antidote.

25:43.409 --> 25:45.319
I promise I'll do
whatever it takes.

25:45.396 --> 25:48.108
It's the right thing, you know.
Getting hitched.

25:48.185 --> 25:50.124
Stalyan, you need
to call this off,

25:50.201 --> 25:52.195
and get me that
antidote right now.

25:52.272 --> 25:54.025
You know what I was
thinking about earlier?

25:54.102 --> 25:55.733
Our trip to Pencosta.

25:55.810 --> 25:57.718
Remember you said
stealing the sultan's jewels

25:57.795 --> 25:59.641
was one of the worst ideas
I've ever had,

25:59.718 --> 26:01.411
but then, I made you
go through with it,

26:01.488 --> 26:04.556
and well, we made
a fortune that day.

26:04.687 --> 26:08.020
My point is, I know
what's best for you, Rider.

26:08.097 --> 26:09.595
I always have.

26:09.711 --> 26:12.428
I know in my heart that
this is where you belong, Flynn.

26:12.505 --> 26:15.369
And deep down,
you know it too.

26:15.487 --> 26:16.714
Well...

26:17.156 --> 26:18.265
it's bad luck for the groom

26:18.342 --> 26:19.508
to see the bride
before the wedding,

26:19.585 --> 26:21.782
and the last thing
any of us needs is...

26:21.898 --> 26:23.395
bad luck.

26:23.842 --> 26:25.395
Right, Flynn?

26:25.686 --> 26:26.790
It's Eugene, now.

26:26.858 --> 26:27.969
No, it's not.

26:28.038 --> 26:29.664
See you out there.

26:33.608 --> 26:35.213
I don't understand.

26:35.290 --> 26:38.836
Pascal, how can Eugene
be getting married?

26:39.435 --> 26:42.539
What if that's the last time
we ever talked?

26:43.114 --> 26:45.444
Why didn't I say "yes"?

Uh, Rapunzel?

28:45.780 --> 28:47.119
We all know
that Eugene and I

28:47.196 --> 28:49.118
don't always agree
on everything.

28:49.445 --> 28:51.005
But over the last year or so,

28:51.082 --> 28:53.428
I've noticed something
that makes him...

28:53.505 --> 28:54.725
less detestable.

28:54.802 --> 28:56.337
He loves you, Rapunzel.

28:56.421 --> 28:58.668
- More than anyone
has ever loved anybody.

28:58.745 --> 29:01.970
And I feel the same way
about him.

29:02.072 --> 29:04.231
I'm just sorry
it took all of this

29:04.338 --> 29:06.485
to truly realize that.

29:06.762 --> 29:08.923
Look, I know what
we both saw down there,

29:09.057 --> 29:10.338
but you and I both know,

29:10.415 --> 29:12.849
this isn't something
Eugene would ever do.

29:12.926 --> 29:13.926
I know.

29:14.003 --> 29:15.294
And you want
to hear something

29:15.362 --> 29:17.165
I know Rapunzel
would never do?

29:17.320 --> 29:19.448
Rapunzel would never give up.

29:19.525 --> 29:20.937
She'd pick herself up,

29:21.014 --> 29:22.681
stop feeling sorry for herself,

29:22.758 --> 29:25.093
and she'd fight back
with everything she had.

29:25.170 --> 29:27.010
So what do you say
we get out there...

29:27.087 --> 29:29.394
And get Eugene back!

29:37.932 --> 29:40.697
Careful, Raps. Remember what happens
when you touch one of those.

29:40.774 --> 29:41.780
Right.

29:41.857 --> 29:43.195
That would be bad.

29:44.114 --> 29:45.950
I was hoping
there would be more people here

29:46.027 --> 29:47.356
to make it easier to slip by.

29:47.433 --> 29:50.806
I guess Stalyan doesn't
have that many friends.

29:50.883 --> 29:53.343
What kinda name
is "Stalyan" anyway?

29:53.432 --> 29:54.747
Who names their kid that?

29:54.824 --> 29:56.510
What's her sister's name?

29:56.587 --> 29:58.815
- Bronco?
- Rapunzel, focus.

29:58.892 --> 30:00.566
We don't have time
for jealousy.

30:00.643 --> 30:02.647
Jealous?
No, I am not jealous.

30:02.724 --> 30:04.152
You're jealous.

30:09.222 --> 30:11.588
Now, the benefit
to only having a few guests

30:11.665 --> 30:14.667
is that we might have
a chance fighting our way in.

30:15.592 --> 30:18.552
A slim chance, but a chance.

30:19.472 --> 30:21.630
We may not have to fight.

30:21.707 --> 30:23.036
I think I have an idea.

30:23.113 --> 30:25.878
Does this idea require
the use of any hooks?

30:26.124 --> 30:30.430
No, but we will need the
help of Vardaros' little sweetheart.

30:30.507 --> 30:31.798
Then what's the plan?

30:31.875 --> 30:34.909
We are gonna crash a wedding.

30:42.182 --> 30:44.055
Remember what
we talked about.

30:44.134 --> 30:46.968
Act normal, and you'll get the
other half when we're done.

30:47.045 --> 30:49.503
I'm good for being
stuck at a wedding.

30:49.580 --> 30:51.476
Yeah. Come to think of it,

30:51.553 --> 30:53.891
I've never actually
been to a wedding before.

30:53.959 --> 30:56.055
Hmm. If we didn't
have to be in disguise,

30:56.132 --> 30:57.334
and it wasn't so dangerous,

30:57.411 --> 31:00.087
and my boyfriend wasn't
marrying another woman,

31:00.228 --> 31:02.159
this might have been fun.

31:07.677 --> 31:10.308
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold up, fellas.

31:11.452 --> 31:12.715
What's this?

31:13.345 --> 31:15.605
The Baron
wanted wedding flowers.

31:19.771 --> 31:21.140
A battle bouquet.

31:21.217 --> 31:22.419
Brilliant.

31:22.512 --> 31:24.051
What was that?

31:25.689 --> 31:28.140
What about you?
Who are you?

31:28.217 --> 31:29.642
I'm Cobra!

31:29.837 --> 31:31.854
Cobra Mc, uh...

31:31.931 --> 31:33.206
McBloodpuncher!

31:33.283 --> 31:34.895
You're not on the list.

31:34.972 --> 31:37.508
Cobra McBloodpuncher
doesn't do lists!

31:37.585 --> 31:39.712
Then what do you do?

31:43.262 --> 31:44.361
Eh?

31:44.762 --> 31:46.636
You should see
what I do to people.

31:50.259 --> 31:52.225
You're alright,
McBloodpuncher!

31:52.302 --> 31:53.725
Why don't you on in there, eh?

31:53.802 --> 31:56.316
Have yourself a good time.
Get some cake.

31:56.439 --> 31:57.492
Phew!

32:16.855 --> 32:18.093
Thank you, Vex.

32:18.170 --> 32:19.756
That was really...

32:19.878 --> 32:20.932
Oh.

32:23.676 --> 32:24.842
Thanks.

32:29.043 --> 32:32.218
Why was I the one to get stuck
in a box with Captain Foot Odor?

32:32.295 --> 32:34.368
You've got enough stink
for two feet!

32:34.445 --> 32:36.690
How dare you,
Miss Viking Breath!

32:36.767 --> 32:38.604
What? Do you brush
your teeth with onions?

32:38.681 --> 32:41.232
- Okay, guys!
Guys! Stick to the plan.

32:41.324 --> 32:43.224
You two grab our friends...

32:43.700 --> 32:46.131
while I cause a distraction.

32:53.675 --> 32:56.896
Look, Lance, I'm sorry
I got you into this.

32:57.128 --> 33:00.381
No matter what,
I just want you to know,

33:00.458 --> 33:01.740
I love you.

33:04.459 --> 33:06.302
I...

33:06.468 --> 33:09.571
I've always wanted
a cat named Clovis.

33:09.754 --> 33:11.805
Clov-Clov-Clovis?

33:12.045 --> 33:13.709
It does have a fun ring to it.

33:13.786 --> 33:16.224
I'm glad we could...
Glad we could share this moment.

33:17.878 --> 33:19.325
Wait here, guys.

33:20.011 --> 33:21.785
I've got to do
this one thing.

33:25.182 --> 33:27.349
He's doing great!

33:41.473 --> 33:43.048
Oh, come on!

33:43.125 --> 33:44.989
Really? Ugh!

33:45.066 --> 33:47.508
I don't usually make fun
of other people's tastes,

33:47.585 --> 33:49.355
but that's just tacky!

33:49.512 --> 33:52.365
- I bet Stalyan picked it out.
- Rapunzel!

33:55.808 --> 33:57.980
Oh, look! There he is.

34:15.472 --> 34:17.435
Let's get on with it. Shall we?

34:17.512 --> 34:18.513
Funny!

34:18.590 --> 34:21.088
I was just thinking
the same thing!

34:21.165 --> 34:22.904
- Blondie!
- Eugene!

34:26.222 --> 34:27.922
Blondie,
you shouldn't be here.

34:27.998 --> 34:30.020
Yeah, move along, Blondie.

34:30.097 --> 34:32.599
Hey, Eugene,
just listen, please.

34:32.676 --> 34:34.891
I may not know
what my future holds,

34:34.969 --> 34:38.130
but I do know that
you are meant to be in it.

34:38.208 --> 34:39.471
I love you.

34:40.924 --> 34:43.106
And now that I've
spilled my heart out

34:43.183 --> 34:44.915
to a room full
of hostile strangers,

34:44.992 --> 34:46.928
feeling a little
self-conscious.

34:47.005 --> 34:48.641
Well, that was lovely.

34:48.719 --> 34:50.003
Are we done here?

34:50.080 --> 34:51.764
Not even close.

34:51.855 --> 34:53.507
I'm just warming up.

34:53.585 --> 34:55.145
Cass! Hookfoot!

34:55.222 --> 34:56.438
Brace yourself!

34:56.514 --> 34:59.107
It's about to get rough in here!

35:10.861 --> 35:14.824
Uh... uh... rough in here!

35:15.236 --> 35:16.356
Impressive.

35:16.917 --> 35:18.541
Uh, come on.

35:18.618 --> 35:19.866
Come on, come on, come on.

35:19.943 --> 35:22.369
Okay, yeah! That played out
differently in my head.

35:22.468 --> 35:24.442
Get them outta here.

35:25.567 --> 35:27.567
Hey! Leave them alone!

35:28.645 --> 35:30.598
Tick-tick, Rider.

35:31.393 --> 35:33.432
Guys! They poisoned Lance!

35:33.573 --> 35:35.265
Hi.

35:35.409 --> 35:37.082
Okay, Raps,
if you have a Plan "B"

35:37.159 --> 35:38.695
now would be a
great time to pitch it.

35:38.772 --> 35:40.400
We need that antidote!

35:40.477 --> 35:41.652
Never, Rider.

35:41.729 --> 35:43.465
Time for a new plan.

35:59.302 --> 36:01.546
Max! That one was mine!

36:07.370 --> 36:08.450
Max!

36:09.849 --> 36:11.435
Sorry, Cass.

36:11.512 --> 36:13.447
You were so right
about being on the road.

36:13.524 --> 36:15.548
It is not all fun and games!

36:15.625 --> 36:17.176
Are you kidding?!

36:17.253 --> 36:19.405
This is fun!

36:23.489 --> 36:25.991
You might want
to give up now.

36:29.608 --> 36:31.960
You're not getting
off the hook that easy.

36:32.037 --> 36:34.334
I thought I said "no hooks!"

36:34.411 --> 36:36.042
Now get out of my way.

36:36.119 --> 36:38.499
Oh, I'm not going anywhere.

36:40.302 --> 36:41.887
Oh, Lance!

36:41.991 --> 36:43.465
Lance, wake up, buddy!
Lance!

36:43.542 --> 36:45.499
Say something! Please!

36:46.012 --> 36:47.170
Clovith.

36:47.247 --> 36:49.091
You grew a goatee.

36:50.052 --> 36:53.241
No, no, no, no. Swollen tongue.
We're running out of time!

36:53.458 --> 36:55.061
Well, this party stinks.

36:55.138 --> 36:56.916
Alright, Rider,
let's get outta here.

36:56.993 --> 36:58.816
His name...

36:58.893 --> 37:00.013
is Eugene.

37:00.133 --> 37:02.975
His name is Rider,
and he belongs with me!

37:03.052 --> 37:04.151
How would you know?

37:04.228 --> 37:06.542
You had to poison his best
friend to get him to marry you!

37:06.619 --> 37:08.191
That is a good point, Rapunzel.

37:08.268 --> 37:10.428
In fairness, that was
my dad's idea!

37:10.505 --> 37:14.056
Ladies! There's probably
a better way to work this out.

37:14.133 --> 37:18.051
We'll work this out as soon
as we get back to the caravan!

37:20.848 --> 37:23.701
And just what are you
gonna do, frog?

37:25.002 --> 37:26.295
I love you!

37:26.440 --> 37:28.998
We need that antidote, Pascal.

37:35.636 --> 37:37.756
Hooray! Sky chicken!

37:39.262 --> 37:41.048
Raps! Time to roll out
that Plan "C."

37:41.125 --> 37:42.646
I don't have a Plan "C."

37:42.723 --> 37:44.070
I thought these rocks
would react

37:44.147 --> 37:46.077
like they did back in Corona!

37:46.168 --> 37:48.818
They're not reacting
because they found the sundrop.

37:48.895 --> 37:50.388
That would be you.

37:51.832 --> 37:53.932
Great. Weird shadow lady.

37:54.009 --> 37:56.834
I'm not that weird!
Hee-yah!

37:56.918 --> 37:59.177
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
I'm with the good guys!

37:59.285 --> 38:02.498
Wow! Thank you, tall person.

38:02.845 --> 38:05.394
Yes! Yes!

38:09.480 --> 38:11.102
You got something I want, Baron.

38:11.179 --> 38:13.381
Come and get it, Rider.

38:25.888 --> 38:28.951
I should've done this
from the beginning.

38:29.054 --> 38:30.927
Alright! Floor chicken!

38:31.168 --> 38:33.685
Oh!

38:33.762 --> 38:36.583
Ah! No! No! No!

38:36.660 --> 38:37.815
No!

38:37.892 --> 38:39.221
The anti-venom.

38:39.298 --> 38:41.473
Where is the anti-venom?

38:48.386 --> 38:49.817
Clovis.

38:49.928 --> 38:51.757
You shaved your goatee.

38:51.949 --> 38:54.014
If I'm going down,

38:54.262 --> 38:56.338
then I'm taking you with me!

38:56.415 --> 38:58.889
Hey, Baron!

39:02.393 --> 39:03.855
Blondie!

39:04.127 --> 39:06.301
Eugene! Oh!

39:12.222 --> 39:13.677
We'll find the anti-venom,

39:13.768 --> 39:16.098
and then I will
settle this, Rider.

39:16.213 --> 39:18.927
The name's Eugene.

39:43.586 --> 39:46.495
I wanted to talk about
when you asked to marry me.

39:46.620 --> 39:50.589
I didn't quite
know what to say.

39:57.283 --> 39:58.893
But I do now.

39:59.103 --> 40:01.229
Eugene, will you...

40:01.306 --> 40:03.255
No. That's not necessary.

40:03.338 --> 40:04.384
What?

40:04.470 --> 40:06.240
You're finally free
and out in the real world.

40:06.317 --> 40:08.534
I understand now that
making a lifetime commitment

40:08.611 --> 40:10.960
is probably the furthest
thing from your mind.

40:11.037 --> 40:13.740
In other words,
now's just not the time.

40:13.902 --> 40:16.749
Oh. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're right, you're right.

40:16.826 --> 40:17.950
Now is not the time.

40:18.027 --> 40:20.741
That is... totally what
I was about to say.

40:21.895 --> 40:25.188
I'm really glad
you feel the same.

40:25.763 --> 40:27.355
But if the time does come,

40:27.432 --> 40:28.694
we need to have a serious talk

40:28.779 --> 40:30.280
about the ceremony
decorations beforehand.

40:30.348 --> 40:31.590
I mean, did you see that swan?

40:31.667 --> 40:33.015
I know, right?!

40:33.092 --> 40:34.827
- So tacky!
- Tack...?

40:34.904 --> 40:36.991
No, that swan is aw...

40:38.466 --> 40:39.743
Awesomely tacky.

40:39.820 --> 40:41.393
I mean, what?!

40:41.470 --> 40:42.679
Outrageous.

40:45.950 --> 40:47.376
This may be the fever talking,

40:47.453 --> 40:50.069
but was there a tall,
angelic enchantress

40:50.146 --> 40:51.645
with a sword here
a second ago?

40:51.722 --> 40:54.280
Yeah! Where did Weirdo go?

41:12.798 --> 41:16.194
Where is it taking us, Pascal?

41:18.472 --> 41:21.038
To fulfill your destiny.

41:22.521 --> 41:24.044
Adira.

41:24.403 --> 41:25.483
Who are you?

41:25.560 --> 41:27.179
Look, I am a friend.

41:27.302 --> 41:29.829
And I am here to make sure
you get to the end

41:29.906 --> 41:32.257
of this journey
you're embarking on.

41:32.464 --> 41:35.038
Listen, I don't have
all the answers,

41:35.208 --> 41:38.077
but now that
I've seen all that I have,

41:38.355 --> 41:39.827
I have no doubt.

41:40.036 --> 41:42.413
These rocks were
looking for you,

41:42.700 --> 41:44.773
