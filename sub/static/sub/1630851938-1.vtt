because the suburbs
lean conservative

A friend of mine back home
just killed himself.

48:14.940 --> 48:16.700
Oh. Well, uh, that's...

48:16.700 --> 48:16.940
Apparently, the bank was gonna
Oh. Well, uh, that's...

48:16.940 --> 48:19.380
Apparently, the bank was gonna
take his farm away, so...

48:21.060 --> 48:22.580
..he gave away his dogs.

48:22.580 --> 48:26.700
Uh, well, I'm not quite sure why
we're hearing about this now, but...

48:26.700 --> 48:28.660
He rode his wheelchair
down the main street...

48:30.300 --> 48:31.820
..and set himself on fire.

48:31.820 --> 48:33.780
Oh, Jesus, Alex, uh...

48:33.780 --> 48:35.660
What are we doing
for people like him?

48:37.580 --> 48:39.100
What are we doing for my son?

48:40.620 --> 48:43.100
What are we doing for anyone
back home?

48:45.020 --> 48:47.740
You don't want an inquiry
into Marcie and Jess, do you?

48:48.820 --> 48:51.180
You just want a black face
to cover it all.

48:51.180 --> 48:51.420
You just want a black face
Well, you should...stop right there.

48:51.420 --> 48:54.580
Well, you should...stop right there.

48:54.580 --> 48:54.820
Alex, I don't think
Well, you should...stop right there.

48:54.820 --> 48:58.220
Alex, I don't think
you actually understand

48:58.220 --> 48:58.460
Alex, I don't think
how easy this has been made for you.

48:58.460 --> 49:00.700
how easy this has been made for you.

49:00.700 --> 49:02.420
You've been given everything.

49:02.420 --> 49:05.340
You've been given a seat.
You've been given campaign support.

49:05.340 --> 49:07.580
You have been promised
a Cabinet post right at the end.

49:07.580 --> 49:11.660
Everything...everything
has been given to you

49:11.660 --> 49:11.900
Everything...everything
on a nice, shiny, silver platter.

49:11.900 --> 49:15.500
on a nice, shiny, silver platter.

49:16.540 --> 49:18.140
And what do you bring to the party?

49:18.140 --> 49:19.580
You come in here and you say,

49:19.580 --> 49:22.100
"What are you gonna do about
the folks back home?"

49:23.620 --> 49:27.060
Well, if your precious folks
back home vote for us,

49:27.060 --> 49:27.300
Well, if your precious folks
we'll do something for the fuckers.

49:27.300 --> 49:28.620
we'll do something for the fuckers.

49:30.260 --> 49:31.780
Until that day...

49:33.820 --> 49:37.020
..you're lucky I don't sack you
right here on the spot.

REPORTER: Laurie Martin's
in damage control today

49:59.940 --> 50:02.420
in the wake of Alex Irving's
shock departure,

50:02.420 --> 50:04.860
just hours after
the election was called.

50:04.860 --> 50:06.620
The volatile former senator

50:06.620 --> 50:09.020
cited a clash of core values

50:09.020 --> 50:13.380
as the reason for her walking away
from yet another political party,

50:13.380 --> 50:13.620
as the reason for her walking away
a move many predict

50:13.620 --> 50:14.940
a move many predict

50:14.940 --> 50:15.180
will mark the end
a move many predict

50:15.180 --> 50:17.940
will mark the end
of her political career.

ALEX ON TV: I no longer trust
our two major parties.

50:20.700 --> 50:23.220
I've seen how they work
and they're not working for us.

50:23.220 --> 50:25.620
There's gotta be a better way
to govern ourselves.

50:25.620 --> 50:25.860
There's gotta be a better way
We're a smart country.

50:25.860 --> 50:27.580
We're a smart country.

It's time we stopped acting
We're a smart country.

50:27.820 --> 50:30.260
It's time we stopped acting
so bloody stupid.

50:30.260 --> 50:34.100
I know some people out there think
I'm a turncoat, a wrecker,

50:34.100 --> 50:34.340
I know some people out there think
a bomb thrower,

50:34.340 --> 50:35.660
a bomb thrower,

50:35.660 --> 50:38.300
because I won't toe a party line.

50:38.300 --> 50:40.060
Well, if that's what it takes

50:40.060 --> 50:42.980
to get the government to listen to
the people who elected them,

50:42.980 --> 50:43.220
to get the government to listen to
then that's what I'll keep doing.

50:43.220 --> 50:44.780
then that's what I'll keep doing.

My home town is in
the electorate of Freeman.

50:48.500 --> 50:51.740
They need someone in Parliament
who knows them,

50:51.740 --> 50:53.060
which is why

50:53.060 --> 50:55.180
I'll be standing as an independent.

50:55.180 --> 50:59.700
And it'll be up to the people of
Freeman to decide if they want me.

50:59.700 --> 50:59.940
And it'll be up to the people of
No-one else.

by lunch, Alex.

51:12.860 --> 51:13.620
You know that.

51:13.620 --> 51:14.620
What do you want, Nick?

Question, former prime minister,

51:16.020 --> 51:17.300
is what do you want?

51:17.300 --> 51:18.380
I've been disendorsed.

51:18.380 --> 51:21.900
There's another word
for 'disendorsed'. Freedom.

51:21.900 --> 51:22.140
That bitch won't die.
for 'disendorsed'. Freedom.

51:22.140 --> 51:23.420
That bitch won't die.

They want you on 'Q+A'.

This doesn't end for me.
