WEBVTT

00:06.537 --> 00:08.679
COME ON, STAN,
KEEP UP.

00:08.679 --> 00:11.712
YOU KNOW HAWK IS SUPER STRICT
ABOUT ME BEING LATE FOR WORK
THE FOOD TRUCK.

00:11.712 --> 00:15.546
YET WHEN IT COMES TO MEAT,
HE PLAYS FAST AND LOOSE
WITH THE EXPIRATION DATES.

00:15.546 --> 00:18.089
THERE HE IS!

00:18.089 --> 00:19.590
Stan:
THIS IS THE HAWK--

00:19.590 --> 00:22.053
WHOA WHOA! WAIT!
I DON'T KNOW WHO THIS IS!

00:22.053 --> 00:24.755
UNFREEZE! UNFREEZE!

00:24.755 --> 00:27.558
YOU MUST BE TYLER.

00:27.558 --> 00:30.261
I'M HAWK'S SISTER,
GATOR!

00:30.261 --> 00:33.264
OW. I THOUGHT HE SAID
HIS SISTER'S NAME WAS LEONA.

00:33.264 --> 00:35.206
ONLY ON MY BIRTH
CERTIFICATE.

00:35.206 --> 00:37.368
YOU CAN CALL ME LEONA
IF YOU WANT TO,

00:37.368 --> 00:40.111
BUT IT'LL BE THE LAST THING
YOU EVER SAY.

00:40.111 --> 00:42.173
HA HA HA HA!

00:42.173 --> 00:44.745
GOT IT. SO, UH,
WHERE'S HAWK?

00:44.745 --> 00:47.178
SQUATCHIN'.
OH, HE'S LOOKING
FOR SASQUATCH?

00:47.178 --> 00:49.520
NO! HE'S LIVIN'
LIKE SASQUATCH.

00:49.520 --> 00:52.723
SLEEPING IN CAVES,
LOOTIN' S'MORES
FROM CAMPSITES--

00:52.723 --> 00:56.587
JUST LIKE HE DREAMED OF
GROWIN' UP.

00:56.587 --> 00:58.759
SO DOES THIS MEAN
YOU'RE TAKING OVER
THE FOOD TRUCK?

00:58.759 --> 01:03.764
NO. I'M WEARING THIS
'CAUSE I'M A APRON MODEL.

01:03.764 --> 01:05.436
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

01:05.436 --> 01:07.438
WELL, I THINK YOU'RE
TAKING OVER THE FOOD TRUCK,

01:07.438 --> 01:09.640
BUT IF YOU ARE AN APRON MODEL,
I DON'T WANT TO OFFEND YOU.

01:09.640 --> 01:11.842
I KNOW MODELS CAN BE
VERY SENSITIVE.

01:11.842 --> 01:14.645
YES, I'M TAKING OVER
THE FOOD TRUCK.

01:14.645 --> 01:17.748
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I'M NOT SENSITIVE.

01:17.748 --> 01:19.610
SO DO I STILL HAVE A JOB?

01:19.610 --> 01:21.512
OF COURSE.

01:21.512 --> 01:23.614
HAWK SAID YOU'RE HARD WORKIN',
CHEERFUL,

01:23.614 --> 01:27.658
NEVER EXAMINE YOUR PAYCHECK
FOR TYPOS.

01:27.658 --> 01:30.721
OH! AND FYI, MY DAUGHTER'S
STOPPIN' BY.

01:30.721 --> 01:32.663
WE'RE NEW IN TOWN,
SHE DOESN'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS.

01:32.663 --> 01:34.595
SO YOU TWO SHOULD MEET.
SHE'S SUPER SWEET.

01:34.595 --> 01:37.528
WHAT'S HER NAME?
THE BEAST!

01:37.528 --> 01:41.702
HER REAL NAME IS EMILY,
BUT EVERYONE CALLS HER
THE BEAST!

01:41.702 --> 01:43.634
WELL, I CAN'T WAIT TO MEET HER.

01:43.634 --> 01:46.307
WELL, THE THING IS,
YOU TWO HAVE A LOT IN COMMON.

01:46.307 --> 01:48.179
SHE'S INTO BMX TOO.

01:48.179 --> 01:50.641
PROBABLY LANDED ON HER FACE
A HUNDRED TIMES,

01:50.641 --> 01:53.584
BUT IT ALWAYS SNAPS BACK.

01:53.584 --> 01:56.116
SHE SOUNDS...RUBBERY.

01:57.548 --> 02:00.421
WELL, I'M SURE YOU TWO
WILL HIT IT OFF.

02:00.421 --> 02:02.623
IF YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.628
THIS IS INSANE.

02:07.628 --> 02:10.261
HAWK'S GONE AND MY NEW BOSS
IS TRYING TO SET ME UP
WITH HER DAUGHTER,

02:10.261 --> 02:12.132
THE BEAST!

02:12.132 --> 02:14.665
Stan:
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TYLER'S
SO WORRIED ABOUT.

02:14.665 --> 02:17.238
I KNEW A DOG NAMED "THE BEAST."

02:17.238 --> 02:20.671
SHE WAS A HOT LITTLE NUMBER--
NOT WHAT YOU'D EXPECT.

02:20.671 --> 02:24.215
♪ OOH HOO, OOH OOH ♪

02:24.215 --> 02:26.677
THERE'S THE SUGAR.

02:46.797 --> 02:49.770
(exaggerated)
HA HA HA HA!

02:49.770 --> 02:52.673
( exaggerated )
HA HA HA HA!

02:52.673 --> 02:55.206
OHHH...
WHERE HAVE YOU GUYS BEEN?

02:55.206 --> 02:58.849
WE WERE DOWN
AT TAMMY'S BUTTONHOLE
GETTIN' OUR SCRAPBOOK ON.

02:58.849 --> 03:01.882
LEARNED ALL ABOUT EMBELLISHMENTS
AND DOO-DADS

03:01.882 --> 03:03.914
AND NOT TO ASK HOW THE STORE
STAYS IN BUSINESS,

03:03.914 --> 03:05.586
BECAUSE TAMMY GETS
REALLY DEFENSIVE.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.619
I LOVE IT HOW SHE SAYS,

03:08.619 --> 03:12.663
"A PICTURE WITHOUT
A DECORATIVE BORDER
IS JUST A PHOTO."

03:12.663 --> 03:15.626
HA HA HA HA HA!
HA HA HA HA!

03:15.626 --> 03:18.629
OH, YOU SO HAD TO BE THERE.
I'M SO GLAD I WASN'T.

03:20.431 --> 03:23.374
HEY, YOU GUYS ARE GETTING
YOUR SCRAPBOOKING JUNK
ALL OVER MY HOMEWORK.

03:23.374 --> 03:25.406
THIS GEOMETRIC PROOF
IS EXCITING ENOUGH.

03:25.406 --> 03:26.877
THE GLITTER IS REDUNDANT.

03:26.877 --> 03:29.640
AVERY, YOU SHOULD GO
DO YOUR HOMEWORK IN
THE FAMILY ROOM.

03:29.640 --> 03:32.443
WHAT? I MEAN, I ALWAYS
DO MY HOMEWORK HERE.

03:32.443 --> 03:34.285
WHY DON'T YOU GO SCRAPBOOK
IN THE FAMILY ROOM?

03:34.285 --> 03:36.787
SCRAPBOOKING IN
THE FAMILY ROOM?

03:36.787 --> 03:38.619
HA HA HA HA HA!
HA HA HA HA HA!

03:38.619 --> 03:42.423
IMAGINE WHAT TAMMY WOULD SAY!

03:42.423 --> 03:45.596
AVERY, WE NEED THE TABLE.
WE GOT MORE CRAFT BAGS COMING.

03:45.596 --> 03:48.329
THAT TAMMY COULD SELL
A SCRAPBOOK TO A FRUIT FLY.

03:48.329 --> 03:50.701
GET IT? SHORT LIFE,
NOT A LOT OF MEMORIES--

03:50.701 --> 03:52.232
WHY WOULD IT NEED
A SCRAPBOOK?

03:52.232 --> 03:53.464
HA HA HA HA HA!
HA HA HA HA!

03:53.464 --> 03:55.606
GOOD ONE, E!
THANKS, C!

03:57.668 --> 03:59.610
DID YOU JUST CALL EACH OTHER
"E" AND "C"?

03:59.610 --> 04:01.672
YEAH. IT'S SCRAPPER TALK.

04:01.672 --> 04:03.844
THAT'S HOW WE DO IT
AT THE BUTTONHOLE.

04:05.776 --> 04:07.518
HEY, IS THAT MY HAIR CLIP?

04:07.518 --> 04:09.019
IT'S THE ONE
YOU GAVE TO ME.

04:09.019 --> 04:10.951
WELL, I WANT IT BACK.
RIGHT NOW?

04:10.951 --> 04:14.425
THE CLIP'S HOLDING
THIS WHOLE THING TOGETHER.

04:14.425 --> 04:16.857
THERE. MAYBE YOU AND "E"
CAN CRAFT A NEW ONE

04:16.857 --> 04:19.259
ON MY HOMEWORK TABLE.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.832
AND IF "A" GETS A "B"
BECAUSE OF "C" AND "E,"

04:21.832 --> 04:24.535
SHE'S GONNA BE TEED...
OFF.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.943
STAN, I JUST
DID SOMETHING BAD.

04:32.943 --> 04:37.708
WELL, JUST GO "OHH!
AAAHH! OHHH!"

04:37.708 --> 04:40.651
THEY'LL ASSUME YOU WERE SICK
AND YOU COULDN'T HOLD IT.

04:40.651 --> 04:42.713
YOU WEREN'T REALLY SICK THEN?

04:42.713 --> 04:45.686
I SPOON-FED YOU FROSTING
BECAUSE YOU SAID THAT'S ALL
YOU COULD KEEP DOWN.

04:45.686 --> 04:49.690
IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER,
THE FROSTING MADE ME SICK.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.492
BUT I THINK WE'RE ALL
FORGETTING HERE

04:51.492 --> 04:54.725
THAT YOU'RE THE ONE THAT
JUST DID SOMETHING BAD.
NOW, WHAT WAS IT?

04:54.725 --> 04:57.297
I JUST GOT
REALLY MAD AT CHLOE
OUT OF NOWHERE,

04:57.297 --> 04:58.599
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY.

04:58.599 --> 05:00.701
I SUSPECT THAT I'M RIGHT,
BECAUSE I ALWAYS AM,

05:00.701 --> 05:02.673
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHY.

05:02.673 --> 05:05.576
WELL, YOU'VE BROUGHT
YOUR DYSFUNCTION
TO THE RIGHT PLACE.

05:05.576 --> 05:08.509
I'VE RECENTLY
BEEN HELPING YOUR DAD OUT
AS A THERAPY DOG.

05:08.509 --> 05:11.742
APPARENTLY, PETTING DOGS
MAKES PATIENTS MORE RELAXED
AND HAPPY.

05:11.742 --> 05:13.544
IT'S ACTUALLY A REAL THING,

05:13.544 --> 05:15.886
AND NOT JUST A SCAM
MADE UP BY MY FAKE ORGANIZATION,

05:15.886 --> 05:17.588
THE PETMORE GROUP.

05:17.588 --> 05:20.921
THE PETMORE GROUP--
NOT A FAKE ORGANIZATION.

05:23.354 --> 05:25.396
SERIOUSLY? THE PETMORE GROUP?

05:25.396 --> 05:27.327
WHY ARE YOU WASTING MY TIME
WITH THIS?

05:27.327 --> 05:29.700
WOW, YOU'RE MAD
AT EVERYONE TODAY.

05:29.700 --> 05:33.404
BUT I CAN HELP YOU.
I'VE REALLY LEARNED A LOT
ABOUT BEING A THERAPIST.

05:33.404 --> 05:35.936
OKAY, MARY, I'M TRYING
A NEW TECHNIQUE.

05:35.936 --> 05:38.609
THIS IS MY THERAPY DOG, STAN.

05:38.609 --> 05:41.472
AND IF YOU PET HIM,
IT WILL HELP YOU RELAX

05:41.472 --> 05:45.876
SO WE CAN BETTER DEAL
WITH YOUR FEAR OF, UM...

05:45.876 --> 05:47.748
DOGS.

05:51.582 --> 05:54.685
BUT AFTER TWO WEEKS SHE GOT
COMPLETELY COMFORTABLE WITH ME.

05:54.685 --> 05:58.489
IN FACT, TOO COMFORTABLE.
OBSESSIVE, EVEN.

05:58.489 --> 06:01.031
SHE'S AT THE WINDOW,
ISN'T SHE?

06:03.934 --> 06:05.896
COME ON, MARY.

06:05.896 --> 06:07.968
SORRY.

06:07.968 --> 06:11.772
ANYHOO, BACK TO
YOUR BRAND OF NUTTINESS.

06:11.772 --> 06:15.476
I WAS PROBABLY JUST ANNOYED
THAT MOM AND CHLOE ASKED ME
TO LEAVE THE TABLE.

06:15.476 --> 06:19.109
AS YOUR THERAPY DOG,
I SUGGEST THAT YOU PEE
UNDER THE TABLE A LITTLE BIT.

06:19.109 --> 06:20.681
MARK YOUR TERRITORY.

06:20.681 --> 06:23.684
IT'S A TECHNIQUE I'M HOPING
TO BE KNOWN FOR SOMEDAY.

06:23.684 --> 06:26.417
SKINNER HAD HIS BOX,
PAVLOV HAD HIS BELL,

06:26.417 --> 06:28.959
I HAVE MY PEE-ON-THINGS.

06:28.959 --> 06:33.023
OR I COULD JUST TELL THEM
THE TABLE IS MY HOMEWORK SPOT

06:33.023 --> 06:34.164
AND I NEED THEM
TO RESPECT THAT.

06:34.164 --> 06:35.866
GREAT. AND IF THAT
DOESN'T WORK--

06:35.866 --> 06:37.698
STAN, I'M NOT
PEEING UNDER THE TABLE.

06:37.698 --> 06:40.731
YOU HAVE TO WANT TO
GET BETTER, AVERY!

06:47.077 --> 06:49.810
OOH, THE BEAST SHOULD
BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

06:49.810 --> 06:52.713
OHHH. TOO BAD
I'M GONNA MISS THAT.

06:52.713 --> 06:54.144
WE'RE ALL OUT OF
PICKLED PEPPERS.

06:54.144 --> 06:56.717
I'M GONNA GO PICK A PECK
OF PICKLED PEPPERS.

06:56.717 --> 06:58.549
BY THE SEASHORE.

06:58.549 --> 07:00.691
THAT'S NONSENSE.

07:00.691 --> 07:02.853
I GOT A PECK OF PICKLED PEPPERS
RIGHT HERE!

07:04.725 --> 07:06.597
( thud )

07:06.597 --> 07:08.529
THE BEAST HAS LANDED!

07:18.509 --> 07:20.711
Stan:
EMILY "THE BEAST" ADAMS.

07:20.711 --> 07:23.544
NOT MY TYPE,
BUT CUTE FOR A HUMAN.

07:23.544 --> 07:25.716
AND I THINK TYLER AGREES.

07:27.678 --> 07:31.722
OH...THIS IS
MY LITTLE GIRL.

07:31.722 --> 07:32.883
THE BEAST!

07:34.024 --> 07:35.626
HEY, I'M TYLER,

07:35.626 --> 07:37.628
AND YOU DO NOT LOOK
LIKE A BEAST.

07:37.628 --> 07:40.190
ACTUALLY, "THE BEAST"
IS FOR HOW I RIDE.

07:40.190 --> 07:42.733
YA KNOW, I'M A REALLY
GOOD RIDER MYSELF.

07:42.733 --> 07:45.536
NO WAY. YOU'RE TOO PRETTY
TO BE ANY GOOD.

07:45.536 --> 07:49.600
THANK YOU. BUT I CAN RIDE
AS GOOD AS ANY UGLY PERSON.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.241
MAYBE I SHOULD
SHOW YOU AROUND,

07:51.241 --> 07:53.003
IMPRESS YOU WITH
MY RIDING SKILLS.

07:53.003 --> 07:54.775
AND I MIGHT IMPRESS YOU.

07:54.775 --> 07:57.678
YOU ALREADY HAVE.
REMEMBER WHEN I WAS LIKE THIS?

07:57.678 --> 07:59.750
THAT WAS IMPRESSED.

08:01.081 --> 08:03.584
OH, I THOUGHT MAYBE
YOU NEEDED THE HEIMLICH,

08:03.584 --> 08:04.955
WHICH I CALL
"THE HUG N' CHUCK"

08:04.955 --> 08:06.857
BECAUSE IT SOUNDS
MORE AMERICAN.

08:06.857 --> 08:09.690
ANYWAY, YOU TWO KIDS
GO RIDE AROUND.

08:09.690 --> 08:12.863
I'M JUST GONNA UNPACK
THAT PECK OF PICKLED PEPPERS
AND PUT IT IN THE PANTRY.

08:17.528 --> 08:18.599
BEAST, WAIT FOR---

08:18.599 --> 08:20.000
OHH! UHH!

08:21.672 --> 08:23.674
--WAIT FOR BEAUTY!

08:29.710 --> 08:31.642
( onlookers oohing )

08:36.817 --> 08:38.549
YOU'RE PRETTY COOL.

08:38.549 --> 08:40.791
AND YOU RIDE LIKE SOMEBODY
WHO SHOULD HAVE SCARS
ALL OVER HIS FACE

08:40.791 --> 08:41.852
AND A COUPLE OF MISSING TEETH.

08:41.852 --> 08:43.754
I'VE HIT MY HEAD A BUNCH,

08:43.754 --> 08:46.597
BUT NEVER REALLY HARD ENOUGH
TO DO ANY REAL--

08:46.597 --> 08:47.858
WHAT WAS I SAYING?

08:47.858 --> 08:49.199
( laughing )

08:49.199 --> 08:51.762
YOU'RE FUNNY.
THANKS FOR THE TOUR.

08:51.762 --> 08:52.863
AND MAYBE I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.

08:52.863 --> 08:54.705
YEAH, I HOPE SO.

08:57.267 --> 08:59.840
HEY, TINY DANCER,
HOW WAS YOUR RIDE?

08:59.840 --> 09:03.644
BEST RIDE EVER.
EMILY IS AMAZING.

09:03.644 --> 09:05.776
WELL, I'M GLAD YOU TWO
HIT IT OFF.

09:05.776 --> 09:08.719
YA KNOW, I WAS A LITTLE WORRIED
AT FIRST WHEN YOU WANTED TO
SET ME UP WITH HER--

09:08.719 --> 09:11.582
WHOA! JUMP OFF THAT VINE,
TARZAN!

09:12.953 --> 09:16.727
I THOUGHT YOU TWO
WOULD GET ALONG AS FRIENDS
BECAUSE YOU BOTH LIKE BMX.

09:16.727 --> 09:18.959
I WASN'T TRYING
TO SET YOU UP WITH HER!

09:18.959 --> 09:22.292
BUT YOU SAID IT'D BE GREAT
IF "YOU TWO HIT IT OFF,
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN,"

09:22.292 --> 09:23.764
THEN YOU WINKED.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.796
I ALWAYS WINK WHEN I SAY
"YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN,"

09:25.796 --> 09:28.298
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

09:28.298 --> 09:31.642
HAWK TOLD ME ABOUT YOU,
HE SAID YOU WERE
A PLAYER WITH THE LADIES.

09:31.642 --> 09:34.144
SO YOU BETTER NOT BE
MAKING THE FLIRTS
WITH MY DAUGHTER!

09:34.144 --> 09:36.807
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?!

09:36.807 --> 09:38.649
AND THIS IS NOT A WINK!

09:38.649 --> 09:41.812
I JUST CAN'T STAND
TO LOOK AT YOU
WITH MY WHOLE FACE!

09:46.887 --> 09:49.790
SWEETIE, I LOVE THIS WHOLE
INDIVIDUAL PIZZA THING

09:49.790 --> 09:51.221
YOU AND MOMMY CAME UP WITH.

09:51.221 --> 09:53.624
IT GIVES US A CHANCE
TO EXPRESS WHO WE ARE.

09:53.624 --> 09:54.825
YOURS HAS NOTHING ON IT.

09:54.825 --> 09:56.166
IT'S A DEEP-DISH.

09:56.166 --> 09:58.028
IT'S ALL BUBBLING
BENEATH THE SURFACE.

09:58.028 --> 10:00.230
HAM, PEPPERONI, OLIVE,
SELF-DOUBT--

10:00.230 --> 10:01.702
I-I MEAN, BASIL.

10:03.774 --> 10:05.676
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
WHILE WE'RE ALL HERE

10:05.676 --> 10:08.078
I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT
THE INCIDENT THAT OCCURRED

10:08.078 --> 10:09.780
AT THIS VERY TABLE
A SHORT WHILE BACK--

10:09.780 --> 10:12.783
OH! THERE'S A BEAD
ON MY PIZZA!

10:12.783 --> 10:14.745
HA HA HA!
A SCRAPPING BEAD!

10:14.745 --> 10:16.987
IT FELL ON MY PIZZA!
OH! TAKE A PICTURE!

10:19.750 --> 10:21.652
HA HA HA HA!
HA HA HA HA!

10:21.652 --> 10:22.793
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

10:22.793 --> 10:24.394
REAL-TIME SCRAPBOOKING.

10:24.394 --> 10:26.126
TO IMMORTALIZE THIS GREAT MEAL

10:26.126 --> 10:29.359
AND ONE DAY
RE-LIVE THE HILARIOUS
"PIZZA BEAD" EPISODE.

10:29.359 --> 10:31.261
HA HA HA HA!

10:31.261 --> 10:33.633
MOM, THIS EPISODE
IS BARELY WORTH LIVING,

10:33.633 --> 10:35.405
LET ALONE RE-LIVING.

10:35.405 --> 10:37.768
AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN
MAKE THE MEAL.

10:37.768 --> 10:40.811
YOU JUST PUT A BUNCH OF TOPPINGS
IN BOWLS AND OPENED
A JAR OF SAUCE!

10:40.811 --> 10:43.774
I ACTUALLY OPENED THE SAUCE.

10:43.774 --> 10:46.146
WHY DO I NEED
VALIDATION FOR THAT?

10:46.146 --> 10:47.748
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU, AVERY?

10:47.748 --> 10:51.351
WELL, I WAS TELLING YOU,
BUT YOU WERE SO BUSY
WITH YOUR LIVE SCRAPPIN'

10:51.351 --> 10:53.383
AND SHODDY ADHESIVE WORK--

10:53.383 --> 10:56.286
I MEAN, LOOK AT
CHLOE'S GLUE JOB.
IT'S ALL LUMPS.

10:56.286 --> 10:58.689
WELL, TAMMY SAID
USE A DAB.

10:58.689 --> 11:00.861
BUT WHAT'S A DAB?
A LITTLE OR A LOT?

11:00.861 --> 11:01.862
I DON'T KNOW!

11:03.233 --> 11:04.735
AVERY, IF THIS HOW
YOU'RE GONNA BEHAVE,

11:04.735 --> 11:06.767
YOU CAN LEAVE THIS TABLE
AND GO TO YOUR ROOM.

11:06.767 --> 11:09.339
OH, PERFECT.
KICK ME OFF THE TABLE AGAIN.

11:09.339 --> 11:12.242
MAYBE THIS TIME
I'LL JUST TAKE IT WITH ME.

11:17.377 --> 11:18.448
I SAID "MAYBE"!

11:24.885 --> 11:27.457
WHY DO I HAVE TO DO THIS
BEFORE I LAY DOWN?

11:27.457 --> 11:29.760
STAN, I NEED YOUR HELP.

11:29.760 --> 11:33.163
IT'S ABOUT EMILY. THE BEAST?
WHO IT TURNS OUT IS GORGEOUS.

11:33.163 --> 11:34.965
CALLED IT!

11:34.965 --> 11:37.968
WHY DON'T YOU
STEP INTO MY OFFICE
AND WE'LL DISCUSS IT.

11:40.370 --> 11:42.102
JUST A FEW RULES:

11:42.102 --> 11:43.734
YOU MIGHT FEEL
THE URGE TO PET ME.

11:43.734 --> 11:45.776
DON'T. THAT'S CALLED
TRANSFERENCE.

11:45.776 --> 11:48.779
IF YOU NEED COMFORTING
YOU CAN PET MY THERAPY MONKEY,
ROBERT.

11:50.140 --> 11:52.783
BUT PLEASE, DO NOT
PUT HIM IN YOUR MOUTH,

11:52.783 --> 11:55.415
BECAUSE THEN I'LL HAVE TO
BARK AT YOU AND IT'LL UNDERMINE
THE PROCESS

11:55.415 --> 11:59.419
BY REMINDING YOU THAT
DOGS ARE NOT THERAPISTS.

11:59.419 --> 12:00.891
NOW, THEN--

12:00.891 --> 12:02.823
YA KNOW WHAT? I'M GOOD.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.825
OHH! ROBERT!

12:06.726 --> 12:08.428
I'LL JUST STAY AWAY
FROM EMILY.

12:08.428 --> 12:09.860
EASIER SAID THAN DONE.

12:09.860 --> 12:11.862
YOU NEED SOME BEHAVIORAL
THERAPY TOOLS.

12:11.862 --> 12:13.233
LIKE WHAT?

12:13.233 --> 12:14.835
STAY AWAY FROM EMILY!

12:22.742 --> 12:23.774
OH, MAN SHE'S HERE.

12:23.774 --> 12:25.816
SHE'S SO CUTE.
DON'T THINK LIKE THAT!

12:27.417 --> 12:29.780
HEY, YOU'RE BACK.

12:29.780 --> 12:31.982
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PLAY IT
SUPER CASUAL.

12:31.982 --> 12:33.223
I LIKE YOU TOO.

12:33.223 --> 12:35.185
YOU GOT ALL THAT
FROM "HEY, YOU'RE BACK"?

12:35.185 --> 12:37.958
THAT AND THE FACT THAT
YOU SAID, "SHE'S SO CUTE,
DON'T THINK LIKE THAT,"

12:37.958 --> 12:39.489
AND HIT YOURSELF IN THE HEAD
WITH A NEWSPAPER.

12:40.991 --> 12:42.032
THE BEAST!

12:42.032 --> 12:43.463
DID YOU TELL TYLER THE NEWS?

12:43.463 --> 12:45.095
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO.

12:45.095 --> 12:46.266
HEY, TYLER, GUESS WHAT?

12:46.266 --> 12:47.767
I'M GONNA BE WORKING HERE
WITH YOU.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.269
SWEET!

12:51.101 --> 12:53.874
YOU KNOW, SO SHE CAN HAVE
MONEY FOR INCIDENTALS

12:53.874 --> 12:56.046
OR INCIDENTS
THAT REQUIRE DENTAL.

12:56.046 --> 12:58.909
AS FOR YOUR DENTAL PLAN...

12:58.909 --> 13:00.550
IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR TEETH,

13:00.550 --> 13:03.113
YOU'LL KEEP THINGS PROFESSIONAL
BETWEEN YOU AND EMILY.

13:03.113 --> 13:06.356
AND BRUSH AND FLOSS REGULARLY.

13:11.221 --> 13:13.123
ALL RIGHT, YOU HEARD
WHAT YOUR MOM SAID.

13:13.123 --> 13:15.795
THIS JOB MEANS A LOT TO ME,
AND I DON'T WANT TO
MESS THAT UP.

13:15.795 --> 13:19.129
SO WE HAVE TO KEEP OUR DISTANCE,
BECAUSE IT'S GETTING PRETTY HOT
IN HERE.

13:19.129 --> 13:21.201
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE
LEANING ON THE GRILL.

13:21.201 --> 13:22.472
OH.

13:22.472 --> 13:24.434
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE JUST HAVE TO GET TO WORK

13:24.434 --> 13:26.136
AND START MAKING
THE BURGERS.

13:26.136 --> 13:27.407
NOT THE FLIRTS.

13:27.407 --> 13:30.010
YOU MEAN LIKE THIS?

13:30.010 --> 13:33.844
♪ OOH OOH OOH ♪

13:33.844 --> 13:36.386
♪ OOH OOH OOH ♪

13:36.386 --> 13:37.817
WHOA!

13:37.817 --> 13:39.419
I TOLD HER
THIS WAS WRONG!

13:39.419 --> 13:41.952
WELL, OF COURSE
IT'S WRONG.

13:41.952 --> 13:44.554
THAT'S NOT HOW
YOU MAKE PATTIES!

13:44.554 --> 13:49.299
YA GOTTA SLAP THAT MEAT
LIKE IT PINCHED YOUR HEINIE
AND CALLED YOU LEONA!

13:49.299 --> 13:51.461
LET ME SHOW YA HOW.

13:51.461 --> 13:54.905
OH, I'M SORRY, I SWEATED OFF
MOST OF MY DEODORANT
BEFORE I GOT TO WORK.

13:56.406 --> 13:59.539
♪ OOH OOH OOH ♪

14:01.171 --> 14:03.513
THIS ISN'T WORKING.
WE'RE FLIRTING TOO MUCH.

14:03.513 --> 14:04.614
GATOR'S GONNA SEE.

14:04.614 --> 14:06.346
I THINK ONE OF US
IS GONNA HAVE TO QUIT.

14:06.346 --> 14:09.579
OR WE COULD JUST START DATING
AND KEEP IT A SECRET.

14:09.579 --> 14:12.352
Gator: NOT ON MY WATCH.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.184
I GOT MUSTARD ON MY WATCH.

14:22.162 --> 14:25.565
SO AVERY HATES ME
ALL OF A SUDDEN
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY.

14:25.565 --> 14:28.939
OKAY, WELL, THIS KIND OF
PUTS ME IN AN AWKWARD POSITION.

14:28.939 --> 14:32.002
YOU SEE, AVERY IS ALSO
ONE OF MY PATIENTS.

14:32.002 --> 14:34.544
OH, GOOD. I'M GLAD
SHE'S GETTING HELP.

14:34.544 --> 14:39.349
THE ONLY ADVICE
I CAN GIVE YOU IS:
BE EXTRA NICE TO AVERY.

14:39.349 --> 14:41.211
DROP A DEAD BIRD
AT HER FEET.

14:41.211 --> 14:42.652
AND IT THAT DOESN'T WORK,

14:42.652 --> 14:45.215
SCRATCH UNDER HER CHIN,
BEHIND HER EAR,

14:45.215 --> 14:47.517
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT
ON THE TOP OF HER HEAD.

14:50.120 --> 14:51.421
( knocking )
OH.

14:51.421 --> 14:52.562
MY FIVE-THIRTY IS HERE.

14:52.562 --> 14:54.594
THAT'S GONNA HAVE TO BE IT
FOR TODAY.

14:54.594 --> 14:56.896
ALL RIGHT.
THANKS, STAN.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.499
SO DO YOU HAVE ANY DEAD BIRDS
I COULD MAYBE...

14:59.499 --> 15:01.571
YEAH, NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

15:01.571 --> 15:04.074
I KINDA NEED
ALL THE ONES I HAVE.

15:06.176 --> 15:08.508
STAN, I'M HAVING
MAJOR ISSUES WITH EMILY.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.010
STAY AWAY FROM EMILY!

15:12.212 --> 15:14.084
I'VE BEEN DOING THAT.
IT DOESN'T WORK.

15:14.084 --> 15:15.645
HAVE YOU TRIED
THE SUNDAY EDITION?

15:18.348 --> 15:20.650
EMILY WANTS TO DATE
AND KEEP IT A SECRET,

15:20.650 --> 15:22.322
BUT HER MOM THINKS
I'M A PLAYER.

15:22.322 --> 15:25.525
WELL, HER MOM HAS A POINT.
YOU ARE KIND OF A PLAYER.

15:25.525 --> 15:27.457
HA HA! OH, YEAH!

15:27.457 --> 15:29.960
NO! I MEAN, NOT WITH THIS GIRL.

15:29.960 --> 15:32.602
NO, EMILY'S DIFFERENT.
SHE'S LIKE THE GIRL ME.

15:32.602 --> 15:34.434
I WOULDN'T PLAY MY GIRL SELF.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.666
I WOULD TREAT HER LIKE
THE LADY SHE IS.

15:36.666 --> 15:38.608
WELL, THEN JUST
TELL HER MOM THAT.

15:38.608 --> 15:40.940
I MEAN, NOT ABOUT TREATING
YOUR GIRL SELF LIKE A LADY,

15:40.940 --> 15:43.974
BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE
THAT MEANS WHAT
YOU THINK IT MEANS.

15:43.974 --> 15:47.577
BUT TELL HER THAT
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE THAT WAY
WITH HER DAUGHTER.

15:47.577 --> 15:49.049
OKAY?

15:49.049 --> 15:51.121
AND I WILL NOT BE THAT WAY
WITH YOUR DAUGHTER.

15:51.121 --> 15:53.653
WELL, I RESPECT YOU FOR
BEING UP FRONT WITH ME.

15:53.653 --> 15:55.355
AND TO SHOW YOU MY GRATITUDE,

15:55.355 --> 15:57.687
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
A TEN-MINUTE HEAD START.

15:57.687 --> 15:59.489
GO.
YOU'RE SO FUNNY.

15:59.489 --> 16:00.560
THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT
I LIKE MOST ABOUT--

16:00.560 --> 16:02.092
GO!!!!
AAAH!

16:11.701 --> 16:13.473
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

16:13.473 --> 16:14.674
STAN SAID THIS WOULD HELP.

16:14.674 --> 16:16.346
WELL, IT'S NOT.

16:16.346 --> 16:18.708
HE HAD ONE OTHER
SUGGESTION.

16:18.708 --> 16:20.610
WHAT IS THAT?

16:20.610 --> 16:23.313
MY OLD GOLDFISH,
RALPH SKIMMERSCOOTER.

16:23.313 --> 16:26.016
STAN WOULDN'T GIVE ME
ONE OF HIS DEAD BIRDS,
SO I DUG UP RALPH.

16:26.016 --> 16:27.057
WE GOOD?

16:28.258 --> 16:30.360
CHLOE, THAT IS DISGUSTING.

16:30.360 --> 16:31.661
YOU DON'T DIG UP YOUR PETS.

16:31.661 --> 16:33.523
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO DO SOMETHING NICE.

16:33.523 --> 16:35.425
IT'S NOT NICE.

16:35.425 --> 16:37.197
WELL, YOU'RE NOT NICE.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.529
I DON'T APPRECIATE
HAVING DEAD ANIMALS...
THAT IS SO RUDE...

16:39.529 --> 16:41.631
( both yelling )
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

16:41.631 --> 16:42.672
GIRLS, WHAT'S GOING ON?

16:42.672 --> 16:44.604
CHLOE IS BEING DRAMATIC.

16:44.604 --> 16:47.077
PROBABLY BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN
HANGING OUT WITH YOU TOO MUCH.

16:47.077 --> 16:49.409
AVERY, THAT IS NO WAY
TO TALK TO YOUR MOTHER.

16:49.409 --> 16:51.711
YOU SHOULDA HEARD HOW
SHE WAS TALKING TO RALPH!

16:51.711 --> 16:54.344
RALPH!

16:54.344 --> 16:59.049
( both yelling )
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE.

16:59.049 --> 17:01.421
BENNETT,
PLEASE HELP ME OUT HERE.

17:01.421 --> 17:04.654
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.
MY OFFICE. NOW.

17:04.654 --> 17:08.198
I THOUGHT I SENSED
SOME TENSION AROUND THE HOUSE.

17:08.198 --> 17:12.602
MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR A LITTLE
PROFESSIONAL INTERVENTION.

17:12.602 --> 17:14.434
Stan: ARE YOU
POACHING MY CLIENTS?

17:14.434 --> 17:16.766
I KNEW I SHOULDA
PEED ON THEM!

17:18.568 --> 17:21.711
SO, WE'RE GONNA DO A LITTLE
GROUP THERAPY SESSION.

17:21.711 --> 17:22.672
CHLOE, YOU START.

17:22.672 --> 17:25.175
WELL, I WAS JUST GETTING
MY SCRAPBOOK ON,

17:25.175 --> 17:27.147
AND THEN AVERY
TOOK MY HAIR CLIP.

17:27.147 --> 17:31.721
Bennett and Stan:
AND HOW DID THAT MAKE YOU FEEL?

17:31.721 --> 17:34.554
I DON'T KNOW. SAD, I GUESS.

17:34.554 --> 17:37.727
IT'S JUST A STUPID CLIP,
BUT YOU GAVE IT TO ME, AVERY,

17:37.727 --> 17:40.260
SO IT WAS SPECIAL.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.332
CHLOE, I--

17:42.332 --> 17:45.435
SWEETIE. WE CAN GO TO TAMMY'S
AND CRAFT A NEW CLIP,

17:45.435 --> 17:47.567
HAVE A LITTLE "E" AND "C" TIME.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.539
OH, BARF IN MY MOUTH!

17:49.539 --> 17:52.572
ALL YOU'VE BEEN HAVING
IS "E" AND "C" TIME!

17:52.572 --> 17:56.306
YOU GO TO THE MALL TOGETHER,
THE STORE, YOU HELP HER OUT
AT SCHOOL.

17:56.306 --> 17:59.449
I MEAN, WHAT KIND OF ADULT
SPENDS SO MUCH TIME WITH
A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD?

17:59.449 --> 18:03.283
A MOTHER, AVERY.
ELL, YOU WERE MY MOTHER FIRST.

18:05.185 --> 18:08.087
I'M SORRY. I DON'T KNOW
WHERE THAT CAME FROM.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.620
Both: THIS IS WHAT
WE CALL A BREAKTHROUGH.

18:14.864 --> 18:18.498
COME ON, CHLOE.
I THINK YOUR MOMMY AND AVERY

18:18.498 --> 18:20.530
NEED A LITTLE "E" AND "A" TIME.

18:20.530 --> 18:23.133
YOU AND I CAN HAVE
SOME "B" AND "C" TIME.

18:23.133 --> 18:26.536
DON'T TALK LIKE A SCRAPPER
IF YOU'RE NOT A SCRAPPER.

18:26.536 --> 18:29.179
IT'S MOMENTS LIKE THIS
THAT MAKE THOSE FOUR MINUTES

18:29.179 --> 18:31.441
I SPENT MAKING
MY FAKE DIPLOMA

18:31.441 --> 18:33.313
ALL WORTH IT.

18:33.313 --> 18:34.614
COME ON, STAN.

18:37.187 --> 18:38.718
I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

18:43.823 --> 18:47.257
LOOK AT YOU.
YOU LOOK LIKE
AN ITTY-BITTY BUG.

18:49.229 --> 18:52.702
I JUST WANTED TO
PIN YOU TO A BOARD
AND HANG YOU ON A WALL.

18:52.702 --> 18:56.536
YOU ALWAYS KNOW
JUST WHAT TO SAY--
IF NOT HOW TO SAY IT.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.839
THAT'S WHY I STARTED
SCRAPBOOKING,

18:59.839 --> 19:02.672
TO REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE
AND NEEDED ME.

19:02.672 --> 19:06.346
THOSE WERE SOME OF
THE BEST TIMES OF MY LIFE.

19:06.346 --> 19:07.677
YOU KNOW, I'M...

19:07.677 --> 19:11.721
ALWAYS TRYING TO BE
SO INDEPENDENT AND MATURE.

19:11.721 --> 19:14.254
BUT THE TRUTH IS,

19:14.254 --> 19:16.656
SOMETIMES I WISH I WAS...

19:16.656 --> 19:20.159
JUST A LITTLE KID AGAIN,
AND I HAD MY MOM.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.661
OH, SWEETIE!

19:21.661 --> 19:23.563
YOU ALWAYS HAVE YOUR MOM!

19:23.563 --> 19:25.335
ALWAYS!

19:27.467 --> 19:29.599
WHY DON'T WE GO
DO SOMETHING TOGETHER?
JUST YOU AND ME.

19:29.599 --> 19:31.501
I WOULD LOVE THAT.

19:31.501 --> 19:34.774
BUT FIRST, I HAVE TO
RETURN THIS HAIR CLIP TO CHLOE.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.606
THAT'S SWEET, HONEY.

19:36.606 --> 19:39.609
AND THEN WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE GO TO THE MALL AND DO
A LITTLE SHOPPING?

19:39.609 --> 19:40.950
THAT'D BE GREAT.

19:40.950 --> 19:42.952
WE SHOULD GO TO
ONE OF YOUR OLD LADY PLACES.

19:42.952 --> 19:44.754
I DON'T WANT MY FRIENDS
TO SEE ME.

19:47.487 --> 19:49.689
I KNOW SHE'S OUT THERE
SOMEWHERE.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.391
HEY, TYLER.

19:51.391 --> 19:53.463
DAD, I JUST WANT
TO LET YOU KNOW

19:53.463 --> 19:55.465
THAT EVERYTHING I AM
IS BECAUSE OF YOU.

19:55.465 --> 19:56.926
DO NOT PIN THAT ON ME.

19:56.926 --> 20:00.430
AND MOM, I JUST WANT TO
TELL YOU THAT--

20:01.771 --> 20:02.772
AAAH!

20:04.474 --> 20:06.576
WHAT? IS SOMETHING
ON MY FACE?

20:06.576 --> 20:07.937
IN MY NOSE?
DO I HAVE A DANGLER?

20:09.809 --> 20:12.582
GATOR'S COME FOR ME.
I'VE GOT TO MAKE A RUN FOR IT.

20:12.582 --> 20:13.543
I CAN BITE HER.

20:13.543 --> 20:15.685
AS A THERAPIST
I COULD BE SUED,

20:15.685 --> 20:17.687
BUT AS A DOG
I COULD BE MUZZLED.

20:17.687 --> 20:19.749
I BETTER BITE HER
AS A THERAPIST.

20:19.749 --> 20:21.621
NO NEED, STAN.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.753
I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE.

20:23.753 --> 20:24.954
AAH!

20:24.954 --> 20:27.557
I'M NOT GONNA HURT YOU.

20:27.557 --> 20:30.600
I WAS LOOKING IN THE WINDOW
TO MAKE SURE I DIDN'T
GET THE WRONG HOUSE AGAIN.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.602
SCARED A COUPLE
OF YOUR NEIGHBORS,

20:32.602 --> 20:34.734
( siren approaches )
TRIPPED A COUPLE OF ALARMS.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.235
WELL, IT TOOK 'EM LONG ENOUGH.

20:36.235 --> 20:39.008
I COULD HAVE
CLEANED THAT PLACE OUT
AND TAKEN A BATH.

20:39.008 --> 20:42.972
THE POINT IT, WHEN I GOT HERE
AND I WAS LOOKING THROUGH
THE WINDOWS,

20:42.972 --> 20:47.377
I OVERHEARD YOUR MOM AND SISTER
TALKING ABOUT GIRLS GROWING UP
AND GETTING INDEPENDENT,

20:47.377 --> 20:50.950
AND I REALIZED THAT EMILY
IS NOT GOING TO BE
MY LITTLE GIRL FOREVER.

20:50.950 --> 20:54.784
I HAVE TO HER MAKE
HER OWN DECISIONS
ABOUT WHO TO DATE.

20:54.784 --> 20:55.925
THANKS, GATOR.

20:57.487 --> 20:58.588
( voice breaking )
YOU CAN CALL ME "MOM."

21:00.660 --> 21:02.632
YOU CAN USE OUR BATH.

21:02.632 --> 21:03.833
PLEASE.

21:07.397 --> 21:08.598
ANYONE SEEING THIS?

21:08.598 --> 21:10.400
ANYONE GONNA, YOU KNOW,
DO ANYTHING?

21:10.400 --> 21:11.771
NO? YOU'RE JUST GONNA
LET THIS HAPPEN?

21:11.771 --> 21:13.943
NOTHING? NOBODY? HELLO?

21:16.005 --> 21:18.678
WELL, MARY EVENTUALLY
BROUGHT ME BACK HOME.

21:18.678 --> 21:22.712
DESPITE MY BEST EFFORTS,
I COULD NOT GET HER TO BE
AFRAID OF DOGS AGAIN.

21:22.712 --> 21:24.584
GOOD THING
SHE'S AFRAID OF CLOWNS.

21:29.689 --> 21:31.691
SORRY I TRACKED MUD
IN THE HOUSE EARLIER.

21:33.563 --> 21:34.694
OOPS.
OKAY, CHLOE,

21:34.694 --> 21:37.727
YOU HAVE TO STOP
DROPPING DEAD ANIMALS
BY PEOPLE.

21:37.727 --> 21:39.799
ESPECIALLY WHEN
IT'S DINNER, SWEETIE.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.931
NOW PLEASE PICK UP THAT CHICKEN
AND RINSE IT OFF.

21:41.931 --> 21:45.004
I'M NOT EATING THIS.
IT'S BEEN ON THE FLOOR.

21:48.077 --> 21:51.541
WHERE DID SHE GET THE IDEA
TO DROP DEAD ANIMALS
AT PEOPLE'S FEET?

21:51.541 --> 21:54.984
MY FAULT. I'M SORRY.
PLEASE ACCEPT THIS
APOLOGY RAT.

21:54.984 --> 21:56.986
AAH! AAH!

21:56.986 --> 21:59.349
OOPS, I GUESS
IT WASN'T REALLY DEAD.

21:59.349 --> 22:01.351
JUST AS WELL.
I WASN'T REALLY SORRY.
