WEBVTT

00:32.253 --> 00:33.912
Somebody call 911!

00:51.829 --> 00:53.043
Brutal murder.

00:53.043 --> 00:55.472
Broad daylight in
the middle of the grove?

00:55.472 --> 00:57.180
Thought I'd seen it all.

00:57.180 --> 01:00.016
Paramedics sure left a mess.

01:00.599 --> 01:03.056
Certainly did.
So we have a frozen crime scene.

01:03.056 --> 01:04.480
What about preliminary?

01:04.480 --> 01:06.044
Multiple stab wounds.

01:06.044 --> 01:09.461
Paramedics said they
worked on him for 20 minutes.

01:09.461 --> 01:11.142
He was a fighter!

01:11.142 --> 01:13.947
yes, he was a figther and
he was a runner, too, wasn't he?

01:13.947 --> 01:16.739
The blood runs all
the way back to the house

01:16.739 --> 01:20.204
which means the killer
followed him down here

01:20.204 --> 01:22.035
to finish the job.

01:22.035 --> 01:23.152
Anyone see anything?

01:23.152 --> 01:27.125
No, we have four eye witnesses
and four different stories.

01:27.125 --> 01:28.507
Typical!

01:28.507 --> 01:30.483
We also have the weapon.

01:30.626 --> 01:32.752
Balisong Butterfly knife.

01:32.752 --> 01:34.712
What about a wound pattern?

01:36.814 --> 01:40.865
Yeah, plus there's
stabs around the chest.

01:41.595 --> 01:43.468
It doesn't make sense.

01:43.468 --> 01:45.254
Most knife murders are sloppy.

01:45.254 --> 01:47.719
It doesn't make sense
if we're dealing with and amateur,

01:47.933 --> 01:50.645
but we...

01:50.645 --> 01:53.417
are looking for a pro.

02:28.449 --> 02:31.241
MIAMI
2x18 Wannabe

03:05.824 --> 03:07.560
(Are) you working
on the blood trail?

03:07.560 --> 03:09.903
yeah, a 150 feet and counting.

03:09.903 --> 03:11.232
This guy was strong as an ox.

03:11.232 --> 03:12.897
Get multiple samples please.

03:12.897 --> 03:15.316
Right. The killer might have
cut himself during the struggle.

03:15.316 --> 03:17.092
- We could get lucky.
- Keep me posted.

03:17.092 --> 03:18.383
I will. Where are you going?

03:18.383 --> 03:20.458
I am going to get some
love from the Feds.

03:20.458 --> 03:22.176
They owe me a favor.

03:36.540 --> 03:38.397
Hey,

03:38.553 --> 03:39.951
Yeah, you!

03:39.951 --> 03:41.072
Gotta back off!

03:41.072 --> 03:42.529
This is my crime scene.

03:42.529 --> 03:44.124
Still active.

03:47.125 --> 03:48.753
What are you doing?

03:53.718 --> 03:55.153
He's got evidence.

03:56.461 --> 03:58.534
He's got evidence.

03:59.010 --> 04:00.020
Hey.

04:05.395 --> 04:07.179
Come back here!

04:09.642 --> 04:10.850
What happened?

04:10.850 --> 04:12.396
- How do I know?
- You let him under the tape!

04:12.396 --> 04:14.993
He was waring a raid jacket.
I thought he was one of you guys.

04:14.993 --> 04:17.773
He just stole evidence
from a murder investigation.

04:17.947 --> 04:19.601
Well, so who was he?

04:19.704 --> 04:21.041
Killer coming back to the scene?

04:21.041 --> 04:23.710
I don't know but now I've
gotta find out what he took.

04:27.829 --> 04:29.801
Patrol officer just dropped that off.

04:29.801 --> 04:32.582
Vic's name is Avi
Golan, Israeli citizen.

04:32.582 --> 04:35.347
And look what's
listed under occupation.

04:35.347 --> 04:37.664
Import/Export how organized crime.

04:37.664 --> 04:41.261
It's consistent with this
type of murder, and there's this!

04:42.304 --> 04:45.219
Looks like our friend
Avi got a little bikini wax.

04:45.219 --> 04:47.893
- Or he's wearing a wire.
- Hidden surveillance mic.

04:47.893 --> 04:49.720
Wonder who he was working for.

04:53.265 --> 04:56.456
The FBI, right on Q.

04:58.559 --> 05:01.083
Last November, quadruple
murder, West Palm Beach.

05:01.083 --> 05:03.755
Israeli business man, his wife
and two kids. I remember it.

05:03.755 --> 05:06.618
The hit was the work of
the A'lad crime syndicate,

05:06.618 --> 05:09.663
Your vic Avi Golan was
one of their top lieutenants.

05:09.663 --> 05:12.454
You flipped him, when
hunting for inditements on the killer.

05:12.454 --> 05:14.060
Did you get anything? / Not yet.

05:14.060 --> 05:17.207
Primary suspect though
is one of A'lad's top killers.

05:17.207 --> 05:20.059
A psycopath, named Danny Fisch.

05:20.059 --> 05:24.465
Very scary customer, likes to work
up close and personal, favors knives.

05:24.465 --> 05:28.055
Specifically a butterfly knife that
he likes to leave at the scene right?

05:28.055 --> 05:29.901
Yeah, that's Fisch's MO.

05:31.368 --> 05:34.820
That family in west palm,

05:34.820 --> 05:39.497
he took his time on the kids.

05:39.497 --> 05:42.396
I've never seen so much blood.

05:42.396 --> 05:45.203
- Avi Golan was all we had.
- Can I bring him in?

05:45.203 --> 05:49.201
Sure, he's a federal parolee.

05:51.151 --> 05:52.548
Excuse me a minute will you?

05:52.548 --> 05:54.702
Yeah.

05:58.389 --> 06:00.140
- We lost a piece of evidence?
- We didn't loose it.

06:00.140 --> 06:02.448
Some guy dressed like one
of us walked under the tape,

06:02.448 --> 06:05.092
he picked something up and
before we can catch up to him he split.

06:05.092 --> 06:07.257
Ok Speed we have to find it.

06:07.716 --> 06:10.667
Well, Bellmonte's cataloguing
in the evidence right now.

06:12.286 --> 06:13.982
We've gotta fix it.

06:28.801 --> 06:30.947
Garbage man found
her on the morning run.

06:30.947 --> 06:34.777
Do we have an ID? / No, not yet
but we did find this in the alley.

06:39.583 --> 06:41.434
Magazine's not full.

06:42.418 --> 06:43.797
Any idea where she came from?

06:43.797 --> 06:45.327
No, but the way she dressed,

06:45.327 --> 06:48.436
she could havebeen clubing
just about anywhere on Collins.

06:48.574 --> 06:50.846
Club yes but a party girl?
I don't know.

06:50.846 --> 06:52.107
Look at her shoes.

06:52.107 --> 06:55.573
It's got a crape sole,
try this at the bottom?

06:56.076 --> 06:57.648
sticky, smells like alcohol.

06:57.648 --> 07:01.156
Those are definitely the kind of shoes you wear
when you're serving the drinks not ordering them.

07:01.156 --> 07:03.783
I'll start canvassing
all the clubs in the area.

07:06.252 --> 07:09.024
All right, are you ready
for a little dumpster diving?

07:13.785 --> 07:16.089
Okay,

07:16.089 --> 07:19.012
You know I don't mind
getting my hands dirty.

07:19.012 --> 07:22.479
I mean maggots,
wet trash I'm the first one in.

07:22.479 --> 07:24.621
Okay, so what are you waiting for?

07:25.545 --> 07:27.460
Ants.

07:30.844 --> 07:33.183
Ants? / Yes, I have
got a problem with ants.

07:33.183 --> 07:35.933
They are sneaky and they are
mobile and when they get on you,

07:35.933 --> 07:37.732
- even if you get them off...
- Ok, Kelly chill,

07:37.732 --> 07:40.016
I'll take care of it.

07:40.194 --> 07:42.163
You can get our next floater.

07:42.163 --> 07:45.213
Oh, I'd love that. Thank you.

07:55.377 --> 07:58.435
Can you get anything off the
plastic bag she was wrapped in?

07:58.435 --> 08:01.567
Yeah, markings on the perforations
should give us the manufacturer.

08:01.567 --> 08:04.843
Well it's as good as a fingerprint
if we can find the role it came off of.

08:04.843 --> 08:07.612
Got a purse, could be our vic's.

08:14.419 --> 08:17.187
Barbara Nance, Hialeah.

08:17.697 --> 08:21.271
Cause of death, exsanguination
due to multiple gun shots.

08:21.271 --> 08:24.315
One to the cheek, one to the chest,

08:24.910 --> 08:27.326
and this is the one
that killed you honey!

08:27.833 --> 08:30.274
Ricochetted off your rib.

08:31.703 --> 08:33.611
Bullet nose is distorted.

08:33.611 --> 08:36.134
Looks like there's
something caught on the tip.

08:40.672 --> 08:42.688
Silver flecks.

08:42.807 --> 08:44.754
- Part of the bullet?
- No, it's non metallic.

08:44.754 --> 08:47.401
It looks like some sort of paint or latex.

08:47.401 --> 08:51.798
Well, What ever it is, it was the last
thing the bullet touched before it hit her.

08:51.798 --> 08:54.119
Alright, I'll take it to trace.

08:54.119 --> 08:55.951
Don't be running off yet!

08:58.933 --> 09:01.291
What is that?
Some kind of insect?

09:01.407 --> 09:04.936
It's an ant. Girl you
needed an exterminator.

09:05.064 --> 09:07.151
She had ants on her face.

09:07.151 --> 09:10.969
Well, these aren't your
garden variety dumpster ants

09:10.969 --> 09:13.381
and not related to decomp.

09:13.381 --> 09:14.697
Why are they in her stomach?

09:14.697 --> 09:15.945
Hormiga Culona.

09:15.945 --> 09:17.535
Leaf colored ants.

09:18.369 --> 09:20.430
It's a columbian dish.

09:20.587 --> 09:22.419
Are you saying that people eat them?

09:22.419 --> 09:27.477
Fried. / Okay, so we're looking
for a club that serves fried ants.

10:02.006 --> 10:03.679
That's her.

10:03.679 --> 10:05.493
That's Barb.

10:06.593 --> 10:07.913
Had she worked here long?

10:07.913 --> 10:10.845
We started together
so, uh, about a year.

10:10.845 --> 10:14.213
Any customers ever get angry
with her, or act inappropriately?

10:14.213 --> 10:17.770
- We're cocktail waitresses...
- But nobody ever got violent?

10:18.298 --> 10:19.811
No.

10:20.204 --> 10:22.576
You don't sound so sure.

10:24.039 --> 10:26.236
The customers we can handle.

10:26.370 --> 10:28.389
Just give us a name.

10:29.914 --> 10:31.460
Our bartender Mark

10:31.460 --> 10:36.193
if he isn't grabbing you he ignores your
orders until you give him half your tips.

10:38.226 --> 10:39.934
Thanks.

10:41.467 --> 10:42.434
Mr. Hobbs.

10:42.434 --> 10:44.600
You were tending bar last night?

10:44.600 --> 10:46.380
Yeah, ever sincethe club re-opened.

10:46.380 --> 10:49.326
Re-opened with a new
name and a new gimmick?

10:49.326 --> 10:50.440
Yeah,

10:50.440 --> 10:53.795
these club kids eat
those ants up like popcorn.

11:03.212 --> 11:05.438
Must be an aphrodisiac.

11:05.557 --> 11:08.052
- I just don't see how.
- You're not the only one.

11:08.052 --> 11:10.723
Hey, it keeps the place packed!

11:10.803 --> 11:12.242
yeah, it seems like
you're doing very well.

11:12.242 --> 11:14.380
Our owner is making
all the money, not me.

11:14.380 --> 11:18.323
Waitress' tips could make for
a good down payment on your own club.

11:18.323 --> 11:22.531
What? / Any problems, anything happen
between you and Barbara last night?

11:22.531 --> 11:26.231
No. We get along real well.

11:26.599 --> 11:30.538
Look, I'll help you
anyway I can but

11:30.538 --> 11:32.507
my people are waiting.

11:37.056 --> 11:39.607
Mr. Hobbs!

11:44.354 --> 11:46.899
I'd like your left shoe please.

11:46.899 --> 11:49.583
- My what?
- I need your left shoe.

12:00.275 --> 12:03.638
Found a casing from a bullet.
It's got some unusual trace on it.

12:03.638 --> 12:06.237
I'll see if Bellmonte is
gonna help us out. / Alright.

12:06.498 --> 12:09.040
See where this clown
keeps his trash bags.

12:09.040 --> 12:11.209
That's where our
waitress was wrapped in.

12:42.593 --> 12:44.071
Tim!

12:44.071 --> 12:45.240
Tell me you're kidding.

12:45.240 --> 12:46.740
Fifty blood stains?

12:46.740 --> 12:49.617
Sorry, the next time,
I'll ask the victim to die in one spot.

12:49.617 --> 12:52.288
Funny. How about I do half of them?

12:53.150 --> 12:54.624
Suit yourself Princess but,

12:54.624 --> 12:56.730
if you find anything foreign
you're going to have to do them all.

12:56.730 --> 12:59.688
That's fair. / Alright.

13:02.360 --> 13:03.702
This guy's running for his life,

13:03.702 --> 13:07.056
bleeding everywhere and Delgado is
complaining about a little extra work.

13:07.056 --> 13:10.347
Yeah, it's not like she let
someone walk off with evidence.

13:10.443 --> 13:12.436
That's not funny.

13:12.559 --> 13:15.609
- What did he end up taking anyway?
- I don't know, that's what we've got to figure out.

13:15.609 --> 13:17.857
If something's missing I don't see it.

13:17.857 --> 13:19.440
Other than the knife,

13:19.440 --> 13:22.427
there's gauze pads latex gloves.

13:22.427 --> 13:24.998
The latex gloves,
how many did you log?

13:25.964 --> 13:27.364
Four into evidence,

13:27.364 --> 13:29.353
but paramedics double glove, so

13:29.353 --> 13:31.345
even number, it's normal.

13:31.345 --> 13:34.930
Right, but I've got,
uh, five in my sketch.

13:37.034 --> 13:39.421
So we're missing the killer's gloves.

13:40.928 --> 13:43.773
Well, I guess that explains
why somebody might come back.

13:43.773 --> 13:47.812
Mr. Fisch was no where near the
location where Avi Golan was killed.

13:47.812 --> 13:51.585
Tell your client that
I can place him at the scene.

13:51.585 --> 13:53.209
It's not what I hear.

13:53.209 --> 13:54.591
What's that supposed to mean?

13:54.591 --> 13:58.509
The responding officer reported
that the scene was compromised.

13:59.981 --> 14:03.429
Procedure was followed and
the evidence will be credible.

14:03.429 --> 14:06.373
Well, have fun proving that.

14:07.236 --> 14:09.908
Are we done?

14:09.908 --> 14:11.912
I have a lunch reservation at the Nobu.

14:11.912 --> 14:14.172
Lieutenant Caine?

14:14.172 --> 14:16.322
A word?

14:24.184 --> 14:27.158
A key piece of evidence was stolen
and this is the first I hear about it?

14:27.158 --> 14:29.268
What exactly was taken?

14:30.786 --> 14:33.560
- It was a bloody latex glove.
- The killer's glove?

14:33.560 --> 14:36.711
We think so. / Dennis, Relax!
We're going to find the glove.

14:36.711 --> 14:37.942
You'd better.

14:37.942 --> 14:41.176
If the Bureau goes down
on this, CSI is coming with us.

14:54.518 --> 14:56.116
Foreign object here, sir.

15:03.151 --> 15:05.862
No that's not foreign.

15:06.619 --> 15:08.248
Just keep moving.

15:52.398 --> 15:54.903
Speedle, I just got
copied on your report.

15:54.903 --> 15:57.023
- Are you trying to get me relieved of duty?
- I'm not trying to jam you up.

15:57.023 --> 16:00.831
- Everything I reported was accurate.
- Look, I just check'em in, that's it.

16:00.831 --> 16:03.232
Once they sign into the log
it's none of my business.

16:03.232 --> 16:04.931
Are you saying that
he signed the log?

16:04.931 --> 16:07.736
I wouldn't let him under
the tape otherwise Speedle.

16:07.736 --> 16:09.128
Let me see that.

16:13.338 --> 16:15.029
Ah, that's cute.

16:15.029 --> 16:16.926
Edmond Locard.

16:17.093 --> 16:18.079
Who's that?

16:18.079 --> 16:21.737
He's the father of modern forensics.

16:21.737 --> 16:23.477
Figures...

16:24.415 --> 16:25.904
I found this at the scene.

16:25.904 --> 16:29.387
It's uh, lycopodium,
its fingerprint powder.

16:29.387 --> 16:31.884
He must have lost it
when he went over the fence.

16:35.513 --> 16:37.121
So what, he had fingerprint powder?

16:37.121 --> 16:39.071
It's fluorescent green.

16:39.285 --> 16:42.484
I mean that's like having
brush guards on your SUV.

16:42.857 --> 16:45.308
I have brush guards on my SUV.

16:46.860 --> 16:50.028
And how many times
have you gone off road?

16:52.199 --> 16:55.108
Exactly. It's for appearance.

16:55.108 --> 16:57.511
It's like using Locard's name in a log.

16:57.511 --> 16:58.811
So who is this guy?

16:58.811 --> 17:02.291
Some weirdo, like a CSI wannabe.

17:02.362 --> 17:03.941
Sorry I took so long.

17:03.941 --> 17:06.773
I did what I could with these.
Not your best work.

17:06.773 --> 17:08.085
I was on a foot pursuit.

17:08.085 --> 17:10.111
Right. / What's that
on the back of the scooter?

17:10.111 --> 17:12.362
Can you clean that up? / Sure.

17:15.598 --> 17:19.693
See that streak?
That's a reflection off the fender.

17:19.693 --> 17:24.454
If I can reduce this to
single point of light,

17:26.502 --> 17:28.682
M.D.C.L.

17:28.682 --> 17:30.420
Some kind of Logo.

17:30.420 --> 17:33.513
You know what?
Do a search for forensics clubs.

17:33.513 --> 17:36.802
Sure.

17:37.913 --> 17:40.320
Gees, there's got to
be a hundred of them.

17:40.755 --> 17:43.855
Put up that one,
Miami-Dade Criminalist League.

17:48.023 --> 17:50.486
That's him, that's the wannabe.

17:52.576 --> 17:54.278
You Wally Shmagin?

17:54.817 --> 17:56.988
Miami-Dade Crime Lab.

17:57.866 --> 18:00.858
Wow, I mean

18:00.858 --> 18:02.936
Wow, how did you
guys find me so fast?

18:02.936 --> 18:04.306
- Can we come in?
- Was it latent prints,

18:04.306 --> 18:06.458
DNA, did my Scooter
leave a tread mark?

18:06.458 --> 18:08.773
Where's that glove that
you took from the crime scene?

18:08.773 --> 18:11.116
The glove? / Yeah.

18:11.283 --> 18:15.297
I thought it was junk,
you know, a castoff. It's in the shrine.

18:15.297 --> 18:16.953
In the shrine?

18:17.057 --> 18:18.773
What is all this?

18:19.014 --> 18:20.852
My collection.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.665
What, do you sell this stuff on E-bay?

18:23.665 --> 18:25.688
No, I buy it.

18:25.688 --> 18:29.231
I have one of the finest
forensics museum in the country.

18:29.321 --> 18:31.209
How do you pay for it?

18:31.303 --> 18:33.737
It's my father's money.

18:40.700 --> 18:43.778
I really hope that's in from Value jet.

18:44.627 --> 18:48.175
Hey hey hey hey,
be careful with that.

18:48.432 --> 18:50.152
Is that really Lizzy Borden's ax?

18:50.152 --> 18:52.219
That's right.

18:52.219 --> 18:54.126
Cost me 15 grand($15000).

18:54.193 --> 18:55.428
Well, you should get your money back

18:55.428 --> 18:58.878
because the real ax
doesn't have a handle on it.

18:58.997 --> 19:01.657
It's on display,
Fault River Massachussettes.

19:01.657 --> 19:04.754
No way, the guy who sold me
that gave me a certificate of authenticity

19:04.754 --> 19:06.696
but I can find it. I know
it's around here somewhere.

19:06.696 --> 19:08.507
Wally! / Yeah.

19:08.507 --> 19:10.247
Get the glove will ya?

19:10.320 --> 19:12.153
Yeah, right.

19:25.001 --> 19:26.459
Bagged and tagged,

19:26.459 --> 19:28.939
chain of custody still intact.

19:38.133 --> 19:39.954
Hook him up.

19:41.929 --> 19:45.990
The casing we found on your shoe
matches the gun we found in the alleyway,

19:45.990 --> 19:49.059
matches the bullet we
got out of Barb's body.

19:52.480 --> 19:55.428
I must have stepped on it
taking trash out to the dumpster.

19:55.428 --> 19:59.153
Was that before or after you and
Barb got into an argument over tips?

19:59.881 --> 20:03.989
The bouncer said he had to break the two
of you up by the dumpster last night around ten.

20:04.171 --> 20:05.755
I know you're stealing tips Barb.

20:05.755 --> 20:07.534
Don't touch me.

20:08.341 --> 20:10.504
They're always screwing
me on the tip money.

20:10.504 --> 20:12.925
Every night!

20:13.465 --> 20:16.254
She was on a cigarette break.

20:16.803 --> 20:19.604
I told her I was tired of her stiffing me.

20:19.604 --> 20:21.881
You finally just got fed up.

20:22.570 --> 20:27.513
Do you really think I'd throw my
whole life away over some tip money?

20:28.128 --> 20:31.435
I found the source for that plastic
bag that waitress was stuffed in.

20:31.435 --> 20:34.546
It's like a fingerprint.
Each tear is unique.

20:34.546 --> 20:36.804
Looks like a match
to nail our bartender.

20:36.804 --> 20:40.531
I collected it from the break room.

20:40.674 --> 20:42.353
Well, bartenders take breaks.

20:42.353 --> 20:45.465
May be, but the break room is for
women only and you need a key to get in.

20:45.465 --> 20:47.687
And you're sure the
bartender doesn't have a key?

20:47.687 --> 20:50.415
He's actually the reason
they put locks in the first place.

20:50.415 --> 20:53.124
So we're looking at
one of our waitresses.

20:53.363 --> 20:54.822
Hey,

20:54.822 --> 20:57.394
heard you have a groupie.

20:58.278 --> 21:00.458
Our little creep's a forensic junkie.

21:00.458 --> 21:02.512
I know, there's a lot of
those around these days.

21:02.512 --> 21:06.355
Yeah, I mean who dreams
about being a criminalist?

21:07.639 --> 21:08.821
You're kidding, right?

21:08.821 --> 21:10.503
Hey, I grew up watching Quincey.

21:10.503 --> 21:13.332
- You mean you didn't?
- This is a paycheck,

21:13.332 --> 21:18.489
- it's a job, it's not my life.
- Well, Mr. Paycheck, you just hit paydirt.

21:19.882 --> 21:22.807
- Epithelials inside the glove.
- With a name,

21:22.807 --> 21:24.891
courtesy of CODIS

21:26.185 --> 21:27.828
Thanks, Kerry.

21:31.626 --> 21:34.502
Got a hit on the glove.
Danny Fisch is our killer.

21:34.502 --> 21:36.368
Good, let's hope it's still admissible.

21:36.368 --> 21:37.299
Why what happened?

21:37.299 --> 21:41.333
Fisch's attorney is moving to
suppress the glove, department F, 10AM

21:41.333 --> 21:43.390
They're going to put
Wally on the stand?

21:45.464 --> 21:47.287
- That kid doesn't have a chance!
- No, I agree,

21:47.287 --> 21:50.188
so we have to give him one.
He is our last shot!

21:57.672 --> 22:00.253
Hey what's going on? They wanna
arrest me, they won't let me go,

22:00.253 --> 22:02.671
officer Everheart here won't even
let me go to the bathroom you know.

22:02.671 --> 22:04.094
I could sue. I know my rights.

22:04.094 --> 22:05.684
Listen to me you little punk.

22:05.684 --> 22:06.927
You gotta get a haircut,

22:06.927 --> 22:08.518
we're gonna put you in a suit and tie,

22:08.518 --> 22:11.910
and we have to get you prepped.
You understand?

22:11.910 --> 22:13.101
What for?

22:13.101 --> 22:15.764
The defense is going
to put you on the stand.

22:15.764 --> 22:19.354
They're going to discredit
the evidence through you.

22:19.354 --> 22:21.015
You got it?

22:21.129 --> 22:22.229
So,

22:22.229 --> 22:25.518
what kind of analysis are we going
to do first, like Co-file or Mass-spec?

22:25.518 --> 22:26.907
I know my stuff, I'm
ready for the big guns.

22:26.907 --> 22:28.796
Are you ready for this?

22:31.485 --> 22:32.766
What is this for?

22:32.766 --> 22:34.419
Tell me exactly what happened.

22:39.206 --> 22:43.010
I picked up the glove, it was bloody.

22:43.175 --> 22:44.557
Alright, hold on.

22:44.557 --> 22:47.416
You collected the glove.

22:47.754 --> 22:51.052
Upon closer examination,

22:51.052 --> 22:55.950
you saw what appeared to be a red
blood stain on the exterior of the glove.

22:55.950 --> 22:57.164
And what time did you leave?

22:57.164 --> 22:59.931
The hell if I know,
I was running away from you.

23:02.478 --> 23:05.037
You left at 11:15.

23:05.264 --> 23:07.997
Upon arrival,

23:08.126 --> 23:10.819
at your personal residence,

23:10.819 --> 23:12.782
you placed the glove

23:12.782 --> 23:17.367
in a secure and
locked drawer for safe keeping.

23:17.504 --> 23:19.622
Don't you guys have someone
to do this kind of stuff for you?

23:19.622 --> 23:21.091
Keep writing.

23:23.325 --> 23:25.683
So, so, did you,

23:25.683 --> 23:28.337
did you get that match
you needed on the glove?

23:29.107 --> 23:32.709
Come on, I found it,
I think I deserve to know.

23:32.709 --> 23:35.209
You stole that glove from
the Avi Golan crime scene,

23:35.209 --> 23:38.150
and you may have
blown a federal murder case.

23:38.150 --> 23:40.914
You know what you deserve? Jail time.

23:41.623 --> 23:45.345
I mean we'd be lucky
if that glove is taken admissible.

23:49.169 --> 23:52.548
I'm always messing things up.

23:53.752 --> 23:56.098
I'm sorry.

23:58.392 --> 24:00.369
Let's just make it right.

24:00.369 --> 24:02.737
Ok? Keep writing.

24:02.832 --> 24:04.821
Safe keeping.

24:08.969 --> 24:10.226
Hey, you alright?

24:10.226 --> 24:11.947
Alright. / You're gonna get some sleep,

24:11.947 --> 24:12.984
and you're going to
meet me here at seven.

24:12.984 --> 24:15.728
Not 7:01, 7:00, you got it?

24:15.728 --> 24:18.713
There's this little party
I'm supposed to go to tonight.

24:18.713 --> 24:20.988
- Alright, fine.
- Just don't drink anything.

24:20.988 --> 24:22.258
I mean that.

24:22.258 --> 24:25.173
- I won't.
- And you're gonna wear this.

24:25.273 --> 24:28.469
A vest? / And a tie,
and I want them both back.

24:28.651 --> 24:30.818
This is about appearance.
You've got to be credible.

24:30.818 --> 24:32.294
You understand?

24:32.476 --> 24:34.864
Absolutely. / Alright.

24:38.408 --> 24:40.880
I don't even know if I can do this.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.563
Welcome to the big leagues.

24:47.388 --> 24:50.263
You remember the bullet
we pulled out of our waitress?

24:50.263 --> 24:53.920
The silver flecks on it were polyisoprene
with a trace amount of ammonia.

24:53.920 --> 24:55.358
Isoprene, that's latex.

24:55.358 --> 24:57.191
Ammonia turns it into liquid latex.

24:57.191 --> 24:58.382
Yeah,

24:58.382 --> 25:01.277
the bullet whole was
through the top of her blouse.

25:03.147 --> 25:04.872
When a girl has no pockets,

25:04.872 --> 25:08.177
you keep things one or two places,
in your shoe or in your bra.

25:08.177 --> 25:11.118
So the bullet was shot through
whatever she was hiding in her blouse.

25:11.118 --> 25:13.280
Bartender said she was hiding tips.

25:13.280 --> 25:15.110
Except there's no latex in money.

25:15.110 --> 25:18.391
An airline ticket, a concert ticket?

25:20.060 --> 25:21.836
Lottery ticket.

25:23.323 --> 25:26.386
I lose every week, but
I can't seem to throw them away.

25:28.959 --> 25:31.529
Same silver flecks as
on the bullet and the dress.

25:31.529 --> 25:34.955
So our dumpster girl was
shot through a lottery ticket.

25:40.494 --> 25:42.987
No one kills for a losing ticket.

25:42.987 --> 25:45.730
And what do you use
to scratch a lottery ticket.

25:46.158 --> 25:48.231
So you two worked
with Barb last night?

25:48.231 --> 25:49.678
Our night to close, why?

25:49.678 --> 25:51.411
Can we see your keys?

26:06.396 --> 26:07.930
Happy enough?

26:07.930 --> 26:09.684
No,

26:09.684 --> 26:13.178
but I'm getting there. Do either
one of you girls play the lottery?

26:13.178 --> 26:14.775
Everybody here does.

26:14.775 --> 26:18.451
The material that we found on the bullet
that killed your friend was liquid latex.

26:18.451 --> 26:21.330
You use liquid latex on lottery tickets.

26:24.177 --> 26:27.206
Jackpot on those gets up to $250,000.

26:27.206 --> 26:31.270
And forensics confirmed that
Barb was shot through a lottery ticket.

26:31.270 --> 26:34.041
Funny thing is we never,

26:34.041 --> 26:35.444
never found the ticket on her.

26:35.444 --> 26:39.302
Well, we play lottery together,
so if you find that ticket it's ours.

26:39.760 --> 26:42.067
It's not the first thing we have to find.

26:42.067 --> 26:44.788
We need a crime scene.

27:06.296 --> 27:08.357
Looks like a crime scene to me!

27:25.783 --> 27:28.288
Found him wandering
around outside the building.

27:28.288 --> 27:30.208
He says he knows you?

27:31.193 --> 27:33.152
Yeah,

27:33.152 --> 27:35.715
thanks, Paula. / Sure.

27:38.301 --> 27:40.460
You're a little early Wally.

27:40.821 --> 27:43.254
I couldn't sleep.

27:43.392 --> 27:45.560
I guess I'm a little nervous.

27:47.668 --> 27:49.851
How was your party?

27:52.682 --> 27:55.307
You know I always feel like

27:55.307 --> 27:58.337
I'm too late or too early
when I go to parties.

27:59.807 --> 28:06.015
Just was out of there
in like two minutes.

28:06.365 --> 28:08.046
What are you doing?

28:08.046 --> 28:10.776
Top secret forensics work.

28:10.909 --> 28:13.853
Case numbers,
initials on every page.

28:17.857 --> 28:22.112
You scared giving testimony
against guys like Danny Fisch?

28:23.204 --> 28:25.364
I'm more scared of
letting a guy like that walk.

28:25.364 --> 28:27.485
Right, me too.

28:35.491 --> 28:37.272
Wally, you should go home.

28:37.272 --> 28:39.977
Get some sleep,
you've got a big day tommorrow.

28:40.212 --> 28:42.140
I could number pages.

29:19.023 --> 29:22.154
Hey, Bellmonte's getting anything
off that bullet casing from the shirt?

29:22.154 --> 29:24.898
It wasn't trace, I sent it over to DNA.

29:24.898 --> 29:26.513
Telling that the substance was organic?

29:26.513 --> 29:29.005
It was human skin burn on the casing.

29:31.035 --> 29:34.225
And the weird thing is we don't
have any burn marks on our victim.

29:34.225 --> 29:38.578
And two gunshots with
a minimum of spatter but I,

29:38.578 --> 29:40.679
I think I figured that out.

29:42.895 --> 29:45.250
There's a void in blood
below the waist band.

29:45.250 --> 29:47.082
Something blocked the spatter,

29:47.082 --> 29:49.398
preventing the blood
from travelling below the waist.

29:49.398 --> 29:50.973
Or someone.

29:56.762 --> 29:58.850
The shooter was sitting on her.

29:58.995 --> 30:00.671
Let's confirm that.

30:18.261 --> 30:21.670
The shooter was approxiamtely 6 feet away
so they couldn't have been sitting on her.

30:21.670 --> 30:25.287
Which means at least two
people were involved in the killing.

30:25.287 --> 30:27.290
One to hold her down,
and one to shoot her.

30:27.290 --> 30:29.835
If we measure the height of the
blood spatter, we can nail the sitter.

30:29.835 --> 30:32.294
Problem with the crime scene
is that we didn't find any spatter.

30:32.294 --> 30:34.214
Then we have to go back.

30:41.860 --> 30:43.876
Wanna take a ride?

30:50.661 --> 30:53.167
I called my kid three times,
he knows about this hearing.

30:53.167 --> 30:55.712
We got a call out
to Wally's condominium.

30:55.712 --> 30:57.554
What does he want?
A ride out to the courthouse?

30:57.554 --> 31:00.035
There's been a developement.

31:00.164 --> 31:02.531
Great, what kind of developement?

31:02.683 --> 31:06.133
The Paramedics found Wally dead.

31:15.805 --> 31:18.597
Mm, he was just here last night.

31:18.695 --> 31:22.251
I know, I'm sorry.

31:24.384 --> 31:26.738
I guess we're not going to court.

31:26.868 --> 31:28.276
No.

31:28.276 --> 31:29.846
You know what?

31:29.846 --> 31:31.820
Let's go to see Wally, / Yeah,

31:31.820 --> 31:33.349
Okay? / yeah

32:13.682 --> 32:16.469
Dual lacerations on the scalp,

32:16.469 --> 32:18.494
chap wounds.

32:18.702 --> 32:20.892
Danny Fisch used
different blade this time.

32:20.892 --> 32:26.230
Wounds are consistent with an ax
but it's too soon to draw any conclusions.

32:27.333 --> 32:30.445
Alexx, it is pretty obvious what happened.
There's a bloody ax over there.

32:30.445 --> 32:32.212
Maybe to you,

32:32.212 --> 32:34.477
but I still have to do my post, okay?

32:34.540 --> 32:37.839
I think we should round up
Fisch before he skips town.

32:37.839 --> 32:39.256
Speed, let's go slow

32:39.256 --> 32:41.040
I'll see you back at the lab

32:41.157 --> 32:42.817
I'd like to process as soon as I could

32:42.817 --> 32:44.545
Ok, but we have one
compromised crime scene,

32:44.545 --> 32:46.127
I don't want another one.

32:46.201 --> 32:47.955
Alright? I'll see you back there.

32:52.034 --> 32:53.627
Okay. / Okay.

32:56.689 --> 32:58.526
Something feels strange to you?

32:58.526 --> 33:01.418
Yes, something is strange.
No forced entry,

33:01.418 --> 33:03.877
and no sign of struggle
with the killer, is there?

33:03.877 --> 33:05.860
I'll look in on my findings.

33:06.489 --> 33:08.183
Good work Alexx.

33:17.470 --> 33:18.676
Hi

33:18.828 --> 33:20.276
Did you get anything out of Wally here?

33:20.276 --> 33:23.753
Massive cerebral trauma,
burn on by penetration of the skull.

33:23.753 --> 33:25.545
So it's killing by the ax?

33:30.158 --> 33:32.533
But not by another's hand

33:32.634 --> 33:35.492
Wait a minute, you're
saying it was self-inflicted?

33:35.492 --> 33:38.663
First few blows are
shallow along a parallel axis

33:38.663 --> 33:40.296
Yes, the killer missed

33:40.296 --> 33:45.416
No, there would be defensive wounds
on Wally's hands and arms, Timmy

33:45.416 --> 33:47.352
These shallow cuts on his head,

33:47.352 --> 33:50.000
hesitation marks,
classic indicator of a suicide

33:50.000 --> 33:51.108
Look, Danny Fish is a pro,

33:51.108 --> 33:54.333
I mean, he could have staged
this to be a suicide, no problem.

33:54.333 --> 33:57.151
That's not my finding, baby.

33:57.151 --> 33:59.667
The fatal blow is self-inflicted.

33:59.667 --> 34:01.347
So Danny Fisch's gonna walk now?

34:01.347 --> 34:03.750
Like you said, the guy's a pro.

34:04.738 --> 34:06.635
Nobody's that good.

34:14.822 --> 34:16.341
What are you doing?

34:16.406 --> 34:19.817
All these stains from
the blood trail in the park?

34:19.817 --> 34:22.255
Yeah, I got them organized.
What do you want?

34:22.255 --> 34:24.451
There's been change of plans.

34:24.451 --> 34:25.976
I need these get
these done now. / Okay,

34:25.976 --> 34:30.251
first, Step away from the desk
You're not a DNA analyst.

34:30.251 --> 34:32.696
If you want them done, I'll do them.

34:32.696 --> 34:34.525
There's gotta be blood
from Danny Fisch at the scene.

34:34.525 --> 34:36.210
There has to be.

34:36.686 --> 34:38.672
How long do you think
this is gonna take?

34:38.672 --> 34:40.697
Several hours.

34:42.521 --> 34:45.699
Once I get the samples in the 3-10,
there's not much to see.

34:45.699 --> 34:48.038
I'm not looking for entertainment

34:50.875 --> 34:52.422
What do you say,

34:52.422 --> 34:55.034
I call you when the results are up?

34:55.034 --> 34:57.020
You can grab dinner or something.

34:57.020 --> 34:58.985
I'm not hungry.

34:59.717 --> 35:01.830
I'd prefer it.

35:15.017 --> 35:16.744
You won't even know I'm here.

35:20.853 --> 35:24.085
We know she was shot right here.

35:24.210 --> 35:26.218
Okay.

35:26.218 --> 35:29.106
The blood that she spit
hit the person sitting on her.

35:29.106 --> 35:31.899
So the rest of it's
got to be somewhere.

35:38.325 --> 35:42.130
You know, places like this
usef sheers to create privacy?

35:42.130 --> 35:44.848
Only tie it back when
they clean the (joint).

36:25.019 --> 36:26.706
So what of the accomplice?

36:26.706 --> 36:29.354
Barb's blood outlined
one of the killers.

36:54.813 --> 36:56.442
You're too tall,

36:56.442 --> 36:58.593
let me try.

37:11.618 --> 37:13.027
What's that for?

37:13.027 --> 37:14.946
This is for our own lottery.

37:14.946 --> 37:17.019
And the winner doesn't
have to go to jail.

37:17.019 --> 37:18.761
38 inches

37:22.946 --> 37:25.963
33 inches, that's still too tall.

37:30.795 --> 37:32.567
30 inches.

37:32.847 --> 37:35.544
So, I guess you were telling the truth.

37:35.709 --> 37:38.092
You didn't shoot Barb after all.

37:38.547 --> 37:41.778
You just held her down
while someone else did.

37:51.677 --> 37:54.148
That's an interesting burn,
how did you get it?

37:55.046 --> 37:58.488
I flat iron before every shift.

37:58.925 --> 38:01.319
Our hair doesn't look good,
we get docked.

38:04.014 --> 38:05.548
Can we go now?

38:06.744 --> 38:08.257
You can.

38:08.257 --> 38:09.946
Not you.

38:12.686 --> 38:17.940
See, the thing about cleavage,
Rachel, is that it just begs you to look.

38:18.876 --> 38:20.292
Pays the rent.

38:20.292 --> 38:22.456
Well, it may have done more than that.

38:22.456 --> 38:24.488
That is not burn from the flat iron.

38:24.488 --> 38:27.114
We know Barb was
hiding a winning ticket

38:29.820 --> 38:31.101
I know you have it

38:31.101 --> 38:34.941
I swear I don't have it. / That is
not true. We know you won.

38:34.941 --> 38:36.288
You watched while
Barb and Jen fought,

38:36.288 --> 38:39.437
and then you went behind
the bar and you got the gun.

38:39.555 --> 38:40.762
Where did you put it?

38:40.762 --> 38:43.236
Quit messing around Barb!

38:43.652 --> 38:45.348
- I swear.
- She's not talking Rachel!

38:45.348 --> 38:46.805
Quit messing around.

38:48.384 --> 38:50.954
- You shot her.
- Shut up and find the ticket.

39:01.052 --> 39:03.965
DNA from your swab
matches DNA from the casing

39:03.965 --> 39:06.016
Which means we know
that you're the shooter.

39:17.429 --> 39:21.565
She has to borrow my tip
money to buy lotto tickets.

39:22.739 --> 39:28.296
I said just, cut me in
if you win anything.

39:30.176 --> 39:31.979
She never said a word.

39:31.979 --> 39:33.477
Where's the ticket now?

39:33.477 --> 39:36.419
Yeah, right. So you can
have the money, I don't think so.

39:36.419 --> 39:38.118
It really doesn't matter that much,

39:38.118 --> 39:43.467
because lottery tickets expire after a year
and you're going to be doing at least twenty.

39:44.098 --> 39:46.345
So where's the ticket?

39:49.641 --> 39:51.221
I'll get this.

39:51.450 --> 39:55.169
No. The best way to deal
with fear is to face it, right?

39:55.303 --> 39:57.014
Absolutely.

40:23.751 --> 40:25.793
Two hundred fifty
thousand dollar winner.

40:25.793 --> 40:27.593
Now that's evidence.

40:33.454 --> 40:35.029
I'll just be a minute

40:37.746 --> 40:39.757
Stragglers? / A few.

41:11.985 --> 41:14.982
So far all we've got is
your victim's blood.

41:18.236 --> 41:19.168
What?

41:19.168 --> 41:22.039
Sample 48 is different
than your victim's.

41:32.841 --> 41:34.184
That's a gravitational drop.

41:34.184 --> 41:36.543
Avi Golan must have
took a swing at his killer.

41:44.425 --> 41:47.120
He left one drop of
blood at the scene.

41:49.641 --> 41:51.601
Danny Fisch?

41:52.054 --> 41:53.404
Hang on.

41:54.391 --> 41:56.861
14, 15

41:56.861 --> 41:58.753
15, 16

41:58.753 --> 42:00.571
19, 25

42:01.898 --> 42:03.961
It's a match.

42:04.727 --> 42:06.705
We've got him.

42:36.876 --> 42:38.894
DNA's a lock.

42:39.210 --> 42:42.457
Found Danny Fisch's blood
at Avi Golan's crime scene.

42:42.457 --> 42:44.218
But, Fisch stabbed him to death.

42:45.105 --> 42:47.567
The US attoney is gonna
move for the death penalty.

42:47.567 --> 42:49.399
It's our case,
why don't we run with it.

42:49.498 --> 42:51.899
This is a tricky conflict of interests.

42:51.899 --> 42:53.150
You know?

42:53.150 --> 42:54.780
Wally?

42:56.215 --> 42:58.776
Speed, Wally did this to himself.

43:01.434 --> 43:03.420
Poor kid was so
frightened that he offed himself.

43:03.420 --> 43:05.845
It's not true.
I spoke with Wally's parents,

43:05.845 --> 43:10.472
And apparently it's not the
first time he tried to kill himself

43:10.472 --> 43:12.994
Now they gave up on him

43:12.994 --> 43:14.767
but you didn't

43:19.490 --> 43:21.799
So uh,

43:21.799 --> 43:24.248
what happens now?

43:24.990 --> 43:27.807
Well, you go home,

43:27.807 --> 43:29.258
you get some rest,

43:29.258 --> 43:31.433
and you come back to work.

43:31.524 --> 43:33.397
Just like that.

43:34.638 --> 43:37.051
Not that easy, is it?

43:39.066 --> 43:41.059
No

43:41.185 --> 43:43.271
No...

43:46.282 --> 43:48.822
Anyway, I'll see you tomorrow.

43:49.079 --> 43:50.609
Yup,

43:50.609 --> 43:52.332
as always.

43:53.918 --> 43:56.550
Hey Speed,

43:56.927 --> 43:58.280
Nice job.
