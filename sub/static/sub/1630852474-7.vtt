WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:05.040
The captain of the SS Carnatic has
reported Mr Fogg as missing at sea,

00:05.040 --> 00:07.040
and feared dead. Fogg is dead?

00:07.040 --> 00:09.280
HELP! Who was that man with the gun?

00:09.280 --> 00:11.040
Why would he do this to us?

00:12.440 --> 00:15.240
My daughter -
she was travelling with Mr Fogg.

00:15.240 --> 00:19.080
One of the other two people missing
is a woman - Miss Abigail Fix.

00:20.640 --> 00:22.680
You were right about Bellamy,
Passepartout.

00:22.680 --> 00:25.760
Who else has a motive to sabotage
our trip? He's not a bad sort.

00:25.760 --> 00:28.560
I don't need to tell anybody here
what kind of man Phileas Fogg was

00:28.560 --> 00:31.280
because you all knew him.
The very best kind of man.

00:31.280 --> 00:34.080
Abandoning Estella like that is
the thing I most regret.

00:34.080 --> 00:37.360
And I've never felt that same
close bond with anyone again.

00:37.360 --> 00:39.240
Well, until this trip, with you two.

00:41.680 --> 00:44.200
That's how we say goodnight,
in France.

00:54.320 --> 00:56.240
WHINNYING

01:00.800 --> 01:02.440
Hey!

01:04.120 --> 01:05.640
Hey!

01:05.640 --> 01:08.200
WHINNYING

01:13.520 --> 01:15.160
This is impossible.

01:15.160 --> 01:18.080
Worse than that lifeboat.
This'll save us a whole day.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.680
Ooh.

01:21.680 --> 01:23.120
Sorry. Sorry.

01:23.120 --> 01:24.880
Ya!

01:29.480 --> 01:31.120
TICKING

01:32.280 --> 01:35.120
You know, looking at that
won't make us go any faster.

01:35.120 --> 01:37.160
The guard on the train said
the Transcontinental

01:37.160 --> 01:38.880
stopped at Iron Point
to repair an axle.

01:38.880 --> 01:40.920
He estimated an eight-hour delay,
so...

01:40.920 --> 01:43.400
..would put it in
Battle Mountain sometime after five.

01:43.400 --> 01:44.840
That was his best guess.

01:44.840 --> 01:46.760
A lot riding on guesswork.

01:46.760 --> 01:49.560
Informed guesswork.
Also known as planning ahead.

01:52.480 --> 01:54.600
WHINNYING

01:56.720 --> 01:59.720
Did this planning involve
bringing any food with us?

02:16.560 --> 02:18.680
Is this all we have?
Between leaving the ship

02:18.680 --> 02:21.400
and boarding the train
in San Francisco, we had 30 minutes.

02:21.400 --> 02:24.120
I'm sorry I didn't have time
to prepare a picnic.

02:24.120 --> 02:26.160
There was all that business
with the luggage too.

02:26.160 --> 02:27.480
You only had to reclaim yours.

02:27.480 --> 02:29.520
I had to go buy a whole new outfit.

02:29.520 --> 02:31.320
Yes, I suppose that does excuse it.

02:31.320 --> 02:33.080
The picnic?

02:33.080 --> 02:34.520
No, the...

02:34.520 --> 02:37.520
I can't believe the shipping company
just gave away your clothes.

02:37.520 --> 02:39.120
Donated to a sailors' charity.

02:40.400 --> 02:41.800
At least it went to a good cause.

02:42.800 --> 02:44.680
At this rate, my trousers will

02:44.680 --> 02:47.440
make it round the world
before we do.

03:03.240 --> 03:05.000
CHAINS JANGLE

03:08.840 --> 03:11.120
Hey, whoa.

03:11.120 --> 03:13.440
TICKING ECHOES

03:29.280 --> 03:31.480
WHINNYING

03:42.960 --> 03:44.640
No need for that.

03:44.640 --> 03:46.200
Your hands ain't empty.

03:47.240 --> 03:48.280
What do you want?

03:49.760 --> 03:51.360
Need a ride.

03:52.920 --> 03:54.560
Ain't my problem, Mister.

03:56.880 --> 03:58.480
It is now.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.480
Why have we stopped?

05:03.400 --> 05:04.600
Who are you?

05:08.640 --> 05:10.160
Name's Bass Reeves.

05:11.400 --> 05:13.120
US Deputy Marshal.

05:14.520 --> 05:16.160
Lost a horse to a wrangler.

05:16.160 --> 05:19.040
Heading for the railroad
at Battle Mountain.

05:19.040 --> 05:21.720
Taking this man back to Louisiana
to stand trial.

05:24.080 --> 05:27.640
- For what?
- Violation of civil rights.

05:27.640 --> 05:30.120
What does that mean?
It's a political invention.

05:30.120 --> 05:32.680
To stop people complaining
about the treatment of the South

05:32.680 --> 05:34.960
since the war. The war you lost.

05:36.160 --> 05:37.520
I'm a gentleman, sir.

05:38.760 --> 05:40.360
A man of honour.

05:40.360 --> 05:42.000
This is a ridiculous conspiracy.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.560
Judge'll decide that.

05:47.880 --> 05:50.080
Looks like you're heading
the same way.

05:50.080 --> 05:52.120
Can take us into town.

05:52.120 --> 05:54.480
Not so fast, Mister.

05:54.480 --> 05:58.040
You two look like trouble
in a box to me.

05:58.040 --> 06:02.040
I ain't asking. I'm insisting.

06:03.040 --> 06:06.520
This is Mr Fogg's hire.
His call, I guess.

06:09.960 --> 06:12.040
Well, um...

06:12.040 --> 06:14.200
More weight slows us down.

06:14.200 --> 06:16.720
He's a US Marshal.
On government business.

06:16.720 --> 06:18.440
With a dangerous criminal.

06:18.440 --> 06:20.320
Don't be ridiculous, woman.

06:22.720 --> 06:24.760
Call me ridiculous one more time.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.080
I wouldn't do that, ma'am.

06:29.880 --> 06:32.880
Call me ma'am again,

06:32.880 --> 06:34.600
and you're next.

06:36.480 --> 06:39.200
Get ready to fight.Now, stop.
We're wasting time here.

06:41.520 --> 06:43.440
So, the Marshal?

06:44.640 --> 06:46.880
Well, we can't just
leave him out here.

06:46.880 --> 06:48.280
We sure can.

06:48.280 --> 06:52.360
And I'll put you all on a Federal
wanted list soon as I make town.

06:54.160 --> 06:56.040
All right. Fine.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.880
But can we please just get going?

06:57.880 --> 06:59.760
Your funeral.

07:01.760 --> 07:03.320
Much obliged.

07:04.600 --> 07:06.120
Get in there.

07:07.480 --> 07:09.560
I said, get in there.

07:09.560 --> 07:11.160
Right, um...

07:37.680 --> 07:39.400
Colonel Ambrose Abernathy.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.360
Phileas Fogg. Fogg?

07:41.360 --> 07:43.080
The adventurer?

07:44.080 --> 07:45.760
Um...

07:45.760 --> 07:48.160
Well, yes, I suppose.
So this must be...

07:48.160 --> 07:50.560
My companions.
Abigail Fix, journalist,

07:50.560 --> 07:52.280
and Passepartout.

07:52.280 --> 07:55.440
I've been reading about you
in the newspapers.Really?!

07:55.440 --> 07:57.240
But they said you were all dead.

07:57.240 --> 07:58.720
What?!Dead? When?

07:58.720 --> 08:00.840
Read it in New York Times
about a week ago.

08:00.840 --> 08:03.600
Paper probably came out
about a week before that. Dead?

08:03.600 --> 08:05.760
Missing, and presumed drowned.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.080
Did it say anything else?
I think there was something

08:09.080 --> 08:11.560
from Miss Fix's father.Fortescue.
What did he say?

08:11.560 --> 08:14.200
That he was heart-broken with grief,
if I recall.

08:18.280 --> 08:20.880
I told you we should have
telegrammed from San Francisco.

08:20.880 --> 08:22.760
There was no time.
At Battle Mountain, then.

08:22.760 --> 08:24.960
So Bellamy can send someone
to kill us again?

08:24.960 --> 08:26.960
But my poor father.
Is not in danger.

08:28.080 --> 08:31.400
It's safer for us to stay dead.
Someone tried to kill you?

08:31.400 --> 08:33.040
No! Yes.

08:34.720 --> 08:37.160
It was a misunderstanding.
He's actually an old friend.

08:38.240 --> 08:40.640
Old friends do not hire assassins.

08:40.640 --> 08:41.920
Passepartout might be right -

08:41.920 --> 08:44.040
sending a telegram might
stir things up. But...

08:44.040 --> 08:45.680
I'll sort it out when I get back.

08:45.680 --> 08:47.200
Man to man.

08:53.080 --> 08:55.320
CHATTER

08:57.560 --> 09:00.560
CLOCK BELL CHIMES

09:07.480 --> 09:09.840
Mr Bellamy?

09:09.840 --> 09:11.400
What do you want?

09:13.320 --> 09:16.200
That is a court warrant for debt.

09:16.200 --> 09:19.840
Pay up, or you'll be
seeing me again.

09:19.840 --> 09:21.400
Very soon.

09:30.760 --> 09:33.080
WHINNYING

09:44.600 --> 09:46.600
Take a GOOD look, if you like.

09:46.600 --> 09:48.960
I'm so sorry. Forgive me.

09:48.960 --> 09:51.800
Um, did you get that in the war?

09:51.800 --> 09:53.920
From when I was a slave.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.160
You were a slave?

09:57.160 --> 09:59.560
So how did you end up a US Marshal?

09:59.560 --> 10:01.840
Escaped from Texas
when the war started.

10:02.840 --> 10:04.920
North into Oklahoma.

10:06.280 --> 10:09.560
Hid out in the Indian Territories
till it was safe.

10:09.560 --> 10:11.040
Took to farming.

10:12.360 --> 10:15.120
But the Government thought
escaping from the South

10:15.120 --> 10:18.040
and living with the Cherokee
meant that I might be useful.

10:19.400 --> 10:23.680
Made me the first black man
west of Mississippi with this badge.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.880
We're a long way from Oklahoma.

10:27.880 --> 10:29.920
Special tracking job.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.880
Recovering this fugitive.

10:35.440 --> 10:37.040
Is he important?

10:37.040 --> 10:38.840
Not any more.

11:07.040 --> 11:09.960
One on horseback, one on foot now.

11:09.960 --> 11:12.360
Looks like Reeves got
the Colonel walking.

11:13.560 --> 11:16.040
Just going to make him
easier to catch.

11:16.040 --> 11:17.720
Now, let's go.

11:25.400 --> 11:27.640
Why have we stopped?

11:27.640 --> 11:29.640
Water. Horses need a drink.

11:29.640 --> 11:31.200
Will it take long?

11:31.200 --> 11:33.680
You know how these things are,
Mr Fogg.

11:33.680 --> 11:35.480
Some things just can't be rushed.

11:36.720 --> 11:39.840
All right,
time to stretch your legs, folks.

11:41.240 --> 11:42.520
All righty.

12:11.280 --> 12:13.240
Your associate, Mr Fogg.

12:13.240 --> 12:15.840
French?Passepartout?Yes.

12:16.840 --> 12:19.280
I thought the English
despised the French.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.840
Well, not individually.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.400
I'm a great admirer of your country.

12:25.480 --> 12:27.560
We share the same values, I think.

12:27.560 --> 12:29.400
Honour.

12:29.400 --> 12:30.880
Order.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.760
Order? A place for everyone.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.320
Everyone in their place.

12:37.920 --> 12:39.680
So, Miss Sally,

12:39.680 --> 12:42.240
have you ever thought about
finding yourself a husband?

12:42.240 --> 12:45.680
Course. Soon as I can find myself
a man who'll let me

12:45.680 --> 12:48.360
carry on doing
whatever the hell I like.

12:48.360 --> 12:49.880
But I ain't holding my breath!

12:49.880 --> 12:51.440
THEY CHUCKLE

12:57.360 --> 12:59.880
Abernathy -
is he actually dangerous?

13:01.560 --> 13:03.680
Some white folks
down in Tennessee...

13:05.480 --> 13:07.080
..formed a secret society.

13:08.880 --> 13:11.320
Dressed up with robes and hoods.

13:11.320 --> 13:13.160
Called themselves the Klan.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.840
CHUCKLES

13:13.160 --> 13:14.840
The what?

13:14.840 --> 13:16.240
No joke.

13:17.720 --> 13:19.480
They put their masks on...

13:20.720 --> 13:23.120
..and they go out
murdering black folk.

13:25.200 --> 13:26.520
Abernathy?

13:26.520 --> 13:28.200
One of the ringleaders.

13:30.600 --> 13:33.560
People like to think
that the war settled all this.

13:33.560 --> 13:35.640
But men like that don't change.

13:37.480 --> 13:40.240
Only, now, they work in the shadows.

13:41.400 --> 13:42.680
Wear hoods.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.920
But given half the chance...

13:55.000 --> 13:57.840
Come on, come on, we're going
to miss this blasted train.

13:59.160 --> 14:01.120
Right, here we go.

14:01.120 --> 14:03.560
WHINNYING, FIX CHUCKLES

14:08.000 --> 14:10.480
The young lady. You know her father?

14:10.480 --> 14:13.040
Fortescue? Yes.
We were at school together.

14:13.040 --> 14:14.520
Yeah, good friend.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.960
Then, you should be more
mindful of your duty.

14:16.960 --> 14:19.880
My duty?
To protect her reputation.

14:20.880 --> 14:23.360
From what? The French boy.

14:23.360 --> 14:25.000
Pardon?

14:25.000 --> 14:27.200
Can't you see how intimate they are?

14:27.200 --> 14:29.320
What?! No.

14:29.320 --> 14:30.680
I mean, they...

14:30.680 --> 14:32.200
Hold on. Intimate? What?

14:32.200 --> 14:33.960
You've been negligent, sir.

14:33.960 --> 14:36.120
Negligent?! What would YOU call it?

14:37.280 --> 14:39.000
You think Fix and Passepartout...

14:39.000 --> 14:40.920
It's obvious.Really?

14:40.920 --> 14:42.800
And what would Fortescue say -

14:42.800 --> 14:45.200
his daughter, with a man like that?

14:45.200 --> 14:47.440
Well, yeah, no, I...

14:47.440 --> 14:48.880
I mean, um...

14:50.280 --> 14:52.200
Passepartout - it's hard to believe.

14:52.200 --> 14:53.600
Believe it, Mr Fogg.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.200
Then do something about it.

15:04.440 --> 15:07.560
Anything happens,
get yourself out of the way.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.480
You AND your friends.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.240
What about you?

15:16.600 --> 15:20.000
I had to fight for the chance
to live as a free man.

15:21.960 --> 15:24.400
If people like Abernathy
want to take that away...

15:25.720 --> 15:27.560
..I'm ready to fight again.

15:32.480 --> 15:34.680
You sound like my brother.

15:34.680 --> 15:36.400
He died fighting for his cause.

15:40.600 --> 15:42.360
If something matters enough...

15:49.640 --> 15:52.600
I'm not sure there's anything
I'd be willing to die for.

15:54.960 --> 15:56.600
You can't say.

15:58.600 --> 16:02.320
Moment comes and you just know.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.760
But not up here.

16:07.120 --> 16:08.640
In here.

16:20.960 --> 16:22.480
All right, folks.

16:22.480 --> 16:24.040
Back on board.

16:24.040 --> 16:25.600
Finally.

16:26.720 --> 16:29.800
So, if there are no delays,
we should still arrive in time.

16:29.800 --> 16:31.440
Hurry up, Mr Fogg.

16:31.440 --> 16:33.960
Don't be slowing us down, now.
Me?! What do you...?

16:33.960 --> 16:35.880
Come on. Don't argue with the woman.

16:35.880 --> 16:37.520
She's got a rifle.

16:37.520 --> 16:39.760
And her sights might be set on YOU.

16:55.440 --> 16:58.240
Looks like they hooked up with
a stage. We're gaining on 'em.

16:58.240 --> 17:00.240
Headed for Battle Mountain.

17:00.240 --> 17:03.080
Must be fixing
to catch a train east. Ya!

17:14.040 --> 17:15.880
Single Action Colt?

17:15.880 --> 17:17.160
It is.

17:18.200 --> 17:19.640
The Peacemaker.

17:23.080 --> 17:24.640
May I?

17:41.640 --> 17:43.320
It's very nice.

17:44.360 --> 17:47.720
My father taught me to shoot
his old Army pistol when I was 12.

17:49.160 --> 17:50.880
Don't know what prompted him.

17:50.880 --> 17:53.560
Fathers always worry
about their little girls.

17:53.560 --> 17:57.040
Makes it easier knowing they can
shoot the eyes of a rattlesnake.

17:57.040 --> 17:59.920
THEY CHUCKLE

17:59.920 --> 18:03.120
I'm not sure it's the rattlesnakes
he needs to be worrying about.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.480
Here.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.400
Try this one.

18:13.440 --> 18:15.880
Colt .22 Pocket pistol.

18:19.480 --> 18:21.040
It's very elegant.

18:22.360 --> 18:24.040
That's because it's mine.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.320
LOOKS fancy.

18:27.320 --> 18:28.680
But kills people.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.840
Keep it.

18:35.840 --> 18:38.800
Safer with you than with him.

18:47.920 --> 18:50.960
KNOCKING

18:47.920 --> 18:50.960
Battle Mountain up ahead.

18:53.160 --> 18:57.040
Let's pray the calculations
about the broken axle were accurate.

19:19.480 --> 19:21.360
HUBBUB

19:39.240 --> 19:41.200
Everybody ready? We're here.

19:42.720 --> 19:45.120
The Transcontinental -
are we on time?

19:45.120 --> 19:47.280
The Transcontinental?
Have we missed it?

19:47.280 --> 19:48.880
It's due half past five, sir.

19:48.880 --> 19:50.880
Ah! It worked!

19:50.880 --> 19:53.040
We made it! Well done!

19:53.040 --> 19:54.880
Ugh! Good!

19:57.440 --> 19:59.680
WHINNYING

20:06.200 --> 20:08.440
CHATTER QUIETENS DOWN

20:12.280 --> 20:14.760
Causing quite a stir.

20:14.760 --> 20:18.040
Yeah. Maybe they've never seen
a Frenchman before.

20:18.040 --> 20:19.680
Maybe it's the suit.

20:22.640 --> 20:25.120
We've made it! I told you.

20:25.120 --> 20:26.680
Think you'll find I told YOU.

20:29.960 --> 20:33.480
Ah, we still have 30 minutes.
We have time to eat. Thank God.

20:33.480 --> 20:35.920
Oh, um, saloon along
the street'll do you something

20:35.920 --> 20:38.200
if you ain't too fussy.
Tres bien.

20:38.200 --> 20:41.320
What are we waiting for? Oh,
I'll be heading back to Mill City.

20:42.360 --> 20:44.960
Then, time to say goodbye.
Thank you. My pleasure.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.720
You got real soft hands, Mr Fogg.

20:56.400 --> 20:57.800
Thank you.

21:00.520 --> 21:02.280
Thank you.

21:08.840 --> 21:10.160
Au revoir.

21:21.480 --> 21:23.400
Inside. Black man with a gun.

21:23.400 --> 21:25.200
You're scaring people, Marshal.

21:25.200 --> 21:27.520
Less talkin', more walkin'.

21:28.800 --> 21:31.200
Thought any more
about your French problem?

21:31.200 --> 21:32.920
Yes, I have, as a matter of fact.

21:32.920 --> 21:34.480
So what are you going to do?

21:34.480 --> 21:36.360
I'm going to leave them alone.

21:36.360 --> 21:37.880
Pardon?

21:37.880 --> 21:41.440
Can't be easy for them, with me
constantly playing gooseberry.

21:41.440 --> 21:44.440
Are you joking? You need to end it,
not encourage it.

21:46.160 --> 21:47.880
Passepartout is a fine young man.

21:47.880 --> 21:50.440
Miss Fix is a fine
young white woman.

21:57.640 --> 21:59.600
All this talk of shared values.

21:59.600 --> 22:01.480
This is what you meant.

22:01.480 --> 22:03.400
Confederate values, sir.

22:03.400 --> 22:05.440
Where everyone knows their place.

22:06.440 --> 22:08.400
Violation of civil rights?

22:08.400 --> 22:10.120
Murder and intimidation.

22:11.480 --> 22:13.640
Had you as a man of vision, Fogg.

22:13.640 --> 22:15.960
But your globe-trotting
has corrupted you.

22:15.960 --> 22:18.880
You've seen the world
but you've understood nothing.

22:18.880 --> 22:20.200
Shut up.

22:26.080 --> 22:28.120
Break up, boys. Bar's closed.

22:28.120 --> 22:31.000
GRUMBLING

22:28.120 --> 22:31.000
Don't want no trouble.

22:33.240 --> 22:35.160
Abernathy thinks you and I...

22:36.400 --> 22:40.640
He thinks we're too...comfortable
with each other.

22:40.640 --> 22:42.400
How do YOU know?

22:42.400 --> 22:45.200
I heard him talking to Fogg
at the water stop.

22:45.200 --> 22:47.200
About us?

22:47.200 --> 22:50.000
He told Fogg to keep us apart.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.440
Mr Fogg...

22:53.080 --> 22:56.080
..what were you discussing
with Abernathy at the water hole?

22:58.000 --> 23:00.120
Um...

23:00.120 --> 23:01.680
Pardon?

23:01.680 --> 23:03.720
I heard you.We were just talking.

23:03.720 --> 23:06.200
About me?Not just you. Me too.

23:06.200 --> 23:08.800
The thing is, I hadn't realised...
How dare you?Look,

23:08.800 --> 23:11.200
Abernathy asked me what was going on
with you two...

23:11.200 --> 23:13.680
There is nothing going on.
It's none of his business.

23:17.520 --> 23:20.160
IS there? YOU seem pretty certain.

23:20.160 --> 23:22.120
Abernathy said it was obvious.
Obvious?

23:22.120 --> 23:24.840
I thought he was worried about
Fortescue but really... My father?

23:24.840 --> 23:27.080
Turns out he was only trying
to... You were discussing

23:27.080 --> 23:29.320
me AND my father with a criminal?
No, no. No. Um...

23:29.320 --> 23:30.720
No...

23:30.720 --> 23:32.000
That...that...

23:32.000 --> 23:33.840
No, he was discussing YOU with ME.

23:33.840 --> 23:36.320
How was it obvious?
I don't know. It wasn't to me.

23:36.320 --> 23:38.080
Or to you, apparently.

23:39.280 --> 23:41.720
But I thought...
So there IS something?

23:41.720 --> 23:43.040
I... No!

23:43.040 --> 23:45.920
Why is everyone being...? People
should mind their own business.

23:47.160 --> 23:48.840
You're a journalist.

23:48.840 --> 23:50.640
Right, that's it.

23:51.920 --> 23:54.120
Where are you going?
I don't know.

23:54.120 --> 23:56.360
Maybe I'll go ride shotgun
on a stagecoach.

23:56.360 --> 23:59.000
Abigail?
Keep your nose out of my affairs.

24:02.680 --> 24:04.280
When she says "affairs"...

24:16.320 --> 24:18.120
Where I come from,

24:18.120 --> 24:20.640
look like that gets
a boy like you hung.

24:22.520 --> 24:27.440
And where I come from, a mouth like
that gets a man like you punched.

24:34.800 --> 24:36.240
Don't rise to it.

24:38.440 --> 24:40.000
It's what he wants.

24:46.280 --> 24:47.880
And you, sir,

24:47.880 --> 24:50.320
you need to work out
which side you're on.

24:52.560 --> 24:54.240
I know which side I'M on.

24:58.320 --> 25:00.800
The one that stands up
to people like you.

25:04.360 --> 25:06.040
Could we see the menu, please?

25:07.800 --> 25:09.320
Bacon.

25:09.320 --> 25:11.120
Beans.

25:11.120 --> 25:12.680
Or bacon and beans.

25:12.680 --> 25:15.680
Are you going to ask him
for the wine list too?

25:15.680 --> 25:17.320
Then, bacon and beans.

25:17.320 --> 25:19.000
For five. Thank you.

25:23.200 --> 25:24.920
We are in something of a hurry.

25:26.160 --> 25:27.640
Everybody's in a hurry.

25:28.960 --> 25:30.320
Right.

25:32.160 --> 25:33.480
Very good.

25:36.680 --> 25:39.240
WHINNYING

25:43.720 --> 25:46.040
Meet us back at the station.

25:52.040 --> 25:53.320
All done.

25:53.320 --> 25:55.320
London, England.

25:55.320 --> 25:58.440
Furthest I ever sent before
is Chicago.

25:58.440 --> 26:00.280
I have something else too.

26:00.280 --> 26:02.680
Oh, sure.
I'll tell them there's more coming.

26:02.680 --> 26:05.000
Hey, move. Out of my way.

26:25.640 --> 26:27.560
Seen any strangers in town?

26:27.560 --> 26:29.040
Try the saloon.

26:30.920 --> 26:32.200
Is he done? Yeah.

26:32.200 --> 26:33.960
Let's get ourselves a drink.

26:33.960 --> 26:35.000
Ya!

26:35.000 --> 26:36.720
WHINNYING

26:36.720 --> 26:39.000
Something wrong?

26:39.000 --> 26:40.720
I've lost the line.

26:40.720 --> 26:42.840
Can't send or receive now.

26:42.840 --> 26:46.640
I got your first message out, and
then everything just went dead.

26:46.640 --> 26:48.640
Someone's cut the wire.

26:49.920 --> 26:51.600
Well, what does that mean?

26:51.600 --> 26:54.280
Means either the bank's
about to get robbed

26:54.280 --> 26:56.480
or somebody's about to get killed.

27:19.320 --> 27:22.360
CLOCK BELL CHIMES

27:26.440 --> 27:27.920
Fortescue?

27:29.280 --> 27:30.960
What on earth are you doing?

27:32.240 --> 27:33.880
Do you know what time it is?

27:38.320 --> 27:39.640
Fortescue.

27:44.640 --> 27:47.600
For God's sake, man.
This is pathetic.

27:50.120 --> 27:52.560
Do you think Abigail would want
to see you like this?

27:52.560 --> 27:55.040
HE SCOFFS

27:52.560 --> 27:55.040
Abigail's gone.

27:57.720 --> 27:59.760
What about poor old Fogg?

28:01.440 --> 28:04.000
Don't you think
we ought to do right by him?

28:04.000 --> 28:06.680
What are you talking about?
You're his executor.

28:08.760 --> 28:10.880
His affairs need to be settled.

28:12.040 --> 28:13.600
What does it matter?

28:14.640 --> 28:16.200
Foggy's gone too.

28:17.960 --> 28:19.560
What does anything matter?

28:19.560 --> 28:21.320
Oh, well, of course it matters.

28:21.320 --> 28:23.200
It's important.

28:23.200 --> 28:25.040
You need to settle the wager.

28:25.040 --> 28:27.000
Phileas is dead.

28:28.520 --> 28:31.080
You can't still expect him
to pay you.

28:31.080 --> 28:33.400
Well, I can.

28:33.400 --> 28:34.760
I must.

28:35.800 --> 28:38.120
It's a matter of honour.

28:38.120 --> 28:39.840
Of...Fogg's honour.

28:41.760 --> 28:44.640
You don't want to tarnish his
reputation as a gentleman, do you?

28:45.640 --> 28:47.800
Well, no, no, of course not.

28:47.800 --> 28:51.760
Look, why don't I make an
appointment with Fogg's solicitors?

28:53.440 --> 28:56.320
We can go together.
Get the ball rolling.

28:57.440 --> 28:59.400
What do you say? Well, I...

28:59.400 --> 29:01.400
Good. Excellent.

29:03.640 --> 29:05.280
And for God's sake...

29:06.840 --> 29:09.800
..pull yourself together, man,
and go home.

29:17.880 --> 29:20.480
DOOR OPENS, CLOSES

29:30.080 --> 29:32.800
DOORS CLATTER, CREAKING

29:35.880 --> 29:37.280
DOOR BANGS

29:44.160 --> 29:46.480
SQUEAKING

29:53.320 --> 29:55.720
BUZZING

30:05.120 --> 30:06.760
Thank you.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.720
Looks lovely.

30:10.720 --> 30:12.680
Bon appetit, monsieur.

30:12.680 --> 30:14.240
And you.

30:18.760 --> 30:20.480
Took long enough.

30:39.080 --> 30:40.440
Whisky.

30:41.600 --> 30:42.920
GUN CLICKS

30:45.120 --> 30:46.880
Bar's shut.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.840
What you gonna do with that?

30:56.440 --> 30:57.480
Shoot.

30:59.240 --> 31:00.360
I don't think so.

31:02.920 --> 31:04.840
Why not?

31:04.840 --> 31:11.200
Cos then my friend will kill you
and those two behind you.

31:11.200 --> 31:13.120
GUN CLICKS

31:15.640 --> 31:17.640
GUN CLICKS

31:18.800 --> 31:20.400
GUN CLICKS

31:25.960 --> 31:27.880
Drop your weapon, Marshal.

31:29.920 --> 31:32.880
Natural order has been restored.

31:39.520 --> 31:41.680
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

31:49.360 --> 31:51.240
Why don't you just go, get away?

31:52.880 --> 31:54.400
Oh, I will.

31:54.400 --> 31:57.360
But first, there's going to be
a reckoning.

32:00.320 --> 32:01.680
What does that mean?

32:03.200 --> 32:04.880
Sergeant...

32:04.880 --> 32:06.960
Do you still carry that switchblade?

32:08.760 --> 32:10.240
Yes, sir.

32:17.440 --> 32:19.160
What are you going to do to me?

32:20.560 --> 32:22.960
To YOU?

32:22.960 --> 32:24.640
Nothing.

32:24.640 --> 32:26.280
The question is,

32:26.280 --> 32:28.640
what are YOU going to do

32:28.640 --> 32:30.080
to HIM?

32:52.320 --> 32:54.360
I won't do it. I can't.

32:54.360 --> 32:55.920
Oh, I think you will, Mr Fogg.

32:57.480 --> 32:59.800
Otherwise three people
are going to die here.

33:00.960 --> 33:02.520
Not just these two.

33:05.200 --> 33:07.520
Like I said.

33:07.520 --> 33:10.160
You need to work out
which side you're on.

33:24.440 --> 33:26.040
Pick up the knife, Mr Fogg.

33:28.480 --> 33:30.640
PANICKED BREATHING

33:32.680 --> 33:34.640
Now, I'm gonna make this easy.

33:36.200 --> 33:37.800
Let's go for a finger.

33:39.560 --> 33:41.480
And you can walk out of here.

33:43.680 --> 33:45.760
I'd say that was a generous offer.

33:48.800 --> 33:50.280
Wouldn't you?

33:54.000 --> 33:56.560
Do it.

33:56.560 --> 33:59.280
What? Do as he says.
Then get out of here.

33:59.280 --> 34:01.400
Look after Fix.But I can't...

34:01.400 --> 34:03.200
It's not you, it's him. Do it.

34:07.600 --> 34:10.040
Go! Get on with it, then.

34:17.440 --> 34:18.760
It's all right.

34:20.360 --> 34:22.160
It's fine. You can do this.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.520
Stop!

34:36.520 --> 34:38.000
Huh! What?!

34:38.000 --> 34:39.360
I haven't done anything.

34:39.360 --> 34:42.200
If you are going to cut,
make sure it is clean.

34:42.200 --> 34:43.960
You know, like an axe.

34:43.960 --> 34:46.000
Don't saw at it
like you do with a steak.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.240
You're not carving a roast.
Carving a roast?!

34:48.240 --> 34:50.520
What are you talking about?
This man is English.

34:50.520 --> 34:53.040
He lives on boiled beef
and brown Windsor soup.

34:53.040 --> 34:55.520
He never slices anything
more difficult than toast!

34:56.560 --> 34:58.920
So, if he's going to do this,

34:58.920 --> 35:02.880
I just want him to...be prepared.

35:06.400 --> 35:07.960
Just be prepared.

35:15.440 --> 35:17.760
WHINNYING

35:25.880 --> 35:28.160
WHINNYING

35:28.160 --> 35:30.440
GUNSHOTS

35:36.160 --> 35:38.400
CLICKING

35:41.120 --> 35:42.680
Out of bullets?

35:48.960 --> 35:50.600
Stay down.

36:03.560 --> 36:05.360
Oh, I got you now, girl!

36:07.040 --> 36:09.360
That pretty little head.

36:19.800 --> 36:21.800
HE GRUNTS SOFTLY

36:25.080 --> 36:26.680
Here.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.840
GUNSHOT

37:00.120 --> 37:02.200
COUGH

37:12.560 --> 37:14.920
PASSEPARTOUT ROARS

37:18.560 --> 37:21.000
Argh!

37:21.000 --> 37:22.560
Ugh!

37:31.720 --> 37:33.960
Are you all right? I'm fine.
But you? I thought...

37:33.960 --> 37:35.960
I know. Don't worry.
Abernathy's gone.

37:35.960 --> 37:37.480
I've got to get after him.

37:37.480 --> 37:39.000
We've got to get after him.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.840
You've got to go.
This ain't your fight.

37:40.840 --> 37:42.480
Yes, it is. Ours too.

37:42.480 --> 37:43.680
Yes.

37:44.920 --> 37:46.440
All right.

37:46.440 --> 37:49.200
Mr Fogg, you're with me.
Very good. We'll take the front.

37:49.200 --> 37:50.560
You two take the back.

37:50.560 --> 37:53.280
Swoop down towards the station.
Fire a shot if you see him.

37:53.280 --> 37:54.920
Don't take any chances.

37:56.440 --> 37:57.800
You ready?

37:57.800 --> 38:00.000
Well, let's find out.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.800
Steady now. Steady.

38:06.840 --> 38:08.120
Here.

38:10.360 --> 38:11.920
Agh! Ugh!

38:13.720 --> 38:15.520
Arghh!

38:16.920 --> 38:19.440
HE GROANS

38:20.520 --> 38:21.920
Stay here.

38:21.920 --> 38:25.040
Watch him.
Cover the street down this way.

38:26.040 --> 38:28.680
On my own?
Holler if you see anything.

38:30.160 --> 38:32.120
I've got to check down here.

38:32.120 --> 38:33.640
All right.

38:35.240 --> 38:36.760
You'll be fine.

39:07.400 --> 39:09.080
HE COUGHS

39:26.200 --> 39:28.320
HE GASPS

39:31.880 --> 39:33.880
DOOR CREAKS

40:23.840 --> 40:26.280
SHUFFLING

40:33.080 --> 40:34.600
Stop.

40:37.400 --> 40:39.400
Drop the pistol and turn around.

40:48.960 --> 40:51.200
Well, if it isn't Mr Fogg.

40:51.200 --> 40:52.680
Drop the gun.

40:55.800 --> 40:57.640
I said drop it.

40:57.640 --> 40:59.480
Or what?

41:01.360 --> 41:03.240
You gonna shoot me?

41:08.720 --> 41:10.880
Takes guts

41:10.880 --> 41:12.960
to kill a man face-to-face.

41:18.520 --> 41:21.160
You think you have the stomach
for it?

41:33.120 --> 41:34.520
Yeah.

41:34.520 --> 41:36.400
I had you pegged as a coward.

41:37.480 --> 41:39.160
Drop it.

41:50.240 --> 41:52.160
Would you have done it?

41:54.240 --> 41:55.720
Tell me.

41:59.520 --> 42:01.240
If he wouldn't,

42:01.240 --> 42:03.320
I certainly will.

42:04.480 --> 42:05.680
You can't.

42:07.040 --> 42:08.520
I'm unarmed.

42:11.480 --> 42:13.280
When did that ever stop you?

42:14.400 --> 42:16.120
Hmm?

42:17.240 --> 42:19.600
No, my friend.

42:21.880 --> 42:23.280
Let's deal in justice...

42:25.200 --> 42:27.440
..not revenge.

42:33.880 --> 42:35.880
We gotta be better than his kind.

43:02.160 --> 43:03.440
I'm wounded.

43:04.480 --> 43:06.400
I need a doctor.

43:07.480 --> 43:09.160
Don't worry.

43:11.760 --> 43:13.720
You'll get everything you deserve.

43:16.960 --> 43:18.680
Nice work, Mr Fogg.

43:18.680 --> 43:21.880
Well, to be honest, I'm not sure
I could've...you know.

43:21.880 --> 43:23.360
You got him.

43:23.360 --> 43:24.840
That's all that matters.

43:26.600 --> 43:29.440
Can't take a Winchester
into the Reform Club, can I?

43:29.440 --> 43:31.360
Can I? No.

43:31.360 --> 43:32.720
No.

43:39.560 --> 43:41.320
The gun don't make the man.

43:41.320 --> 43:42.800
Does it get any easier?

43:43.920 --> 43:46.600
Standing up to people like that?

43:46.600 --> 43:49.320
Does if there are people
who'll stand with you.Mm.

43:50.640 --> 43:53.920
Reckon I've got a few things to tidy
up round here now before I head out.

43:53.920 --> 43:56.200
But, uh...
TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS

43:56.200 --> 43:58.400
..shouldn't you people be...?
Oh, my Lord!

44:06.760 --> 44:08.880
When you came in on the horse...

44:08.880 --> 44:10.600
I saved your life.

44:10.600 --> 44:12.280
True.

44:12.280 --> 44:13.520
And I saved yours.

44:14.600 --> 44:16.280
Lucky for both of us.

44:19.200 --> 44:21.600
But the world is full of Abernathys.

44:21.600 --> 44:23.080
And Kneedlings.

44:23.080 --> 44:24.840
And Bellamys.

44:24.840 --> 44:26.680
And Bass Reeves.

44:26.680 --> 44:28.720
And Phileas Fogg.

44:28.720 --> 44:30.880
And Jean Passepartout.

44:35.880 --> 44:37.160
What are you doing?!

44:37.160 --> 44:39.800
We've got a train to catch!
We're heading home! Come on!

44:39.800 --> 44:41.520
Just a train ride and a boat trip.

44:41.520 --> 44:43.080
What could possibly go wrong?

44:43.080 --> 44:44.760
PASSEPARTOUT LAUGHS

44:53.920 --> 44:55.880
We're going to be late.

44:55.880 --> 44:57.600
There's no rush.

44:57.600 --> 45:00.400
The meeting's at five.
It's already a quarter to.

45:00.400 --> 45:02.600
I don't even know why
you need to come with me, Bellamy.

45:02.600 --> 45:05.280
Well, I thought you might appreciate
some help with the details.

45:05.280 --> 45:06.680
Wills can be complicated things.

45:06.680 --> 45:08.680
Telegram for you, Mr Fortescue.

45:08.680 --> 45:10.640
Oh, God... Oh, thank you.

45:17.960 --> 45:19.680
You can read it on the way!

45:30.080 --> 45:31.880
What on earth is it?

45:36.480 --> 45:38.120
"Reports exaggerate.

45:38.120 --> 45:40.200
"All...all are alive"?!

45:41.360 --> 45:43.880
"En route to New York.
London soon.

45:43.880 --> 45:45.080
"Abigail."

45:45.080 --> 45:46.680
They're alive.

45:46.680 --> 45:48.320
All of them!

45:48.320 --> 45:49.840
Alive!

45:49.840 --> 45:51.280
Abigail.

45:51.280 --> 45:52.920
And Fogg.

45:52.920 --> 45:54.520
They're alive!

45:54.520 --> 45:57.440
EXCITED CHATTER

45:54.520 --> 45:57.440
And heading for New York!

45:57.440 --> 45:58.720
ALIVE!

46:00.120 --> 46:01.520
CHEERING

46:10.800 --> 46:12.800
EXCITED SHOUTING

46:15.880 --> 46:20.400
Hip-hip! Hooray! Hip-hip! Hooray!

46:33.120 --> 46:35.000
New York City!

46:35.000 --> 46:37.040
At last.

46:37.040 --> 46:40.840
First thing is to book a passage
on the fastest boat possible.

46:40.840 --> 46:42.600
What's this? Mr Fogg!

46:47.640 --> 46:50.320
Mr Fogg! You think you can still
win the wager?

46:50.320 --> 46:52.400
Of course he can.

46:52.400 --> 46:55.280
And is it true you captured
a dangerous fugitive single-handed?

46:55.280 --> 46:57.040
Single-handed?

46:57.040 --> 46:59.080
How long are you staying?

46:59.080 --> 47:00.520
VOICES FADE

47:00.520 --> 47:02.360
Miss Fix, have you heard
from your father?
