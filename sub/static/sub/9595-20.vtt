08:51.231 --> 08:52.998
Dre, hey.
You were so right.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.600
"the good wife" is totally
"girls" meets "downton abbey."

08:55.602 --> 08:56.568
Thanks for the reco.

08:56.570 --> 08:58.870
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

08:58.872 --> 09:03.875
<i>Was actually thinking of</i>
<i>putting charlie over me.</i>

09:03.877 --> 09:08.013
<i>White jay was going to put</i>
<i>charles in charge of</i> me!

09:11.851 --> 09:13.718
Yo, hot sauce on goldfish?
That's genius.

09:13.720 --> 09:14.886
I like to call it
"hotfish."

09:14.888 --> 09:16.655
Yo, do you ever
turn it off?

09:16.657 --> 09:17.656
No.

09:17.658 --> 09:18.290
[ giggles ]

09:18.292 --> 09:23.995
If charlie get this account,
<i>he'll</i> be<i> my</i> boss.

09:23.997 --> 09:25.931
Can you imagine that?

09:28.334 --> 09:29.868
Two-piece cat,

09:29.870 --> 09:32.137
Hush puppies with fries,
and 'tatah salad!

09:32.139 --> 09:33.672
We're almost of of slaw!

09:33.674 --> 09:34.673
I said 'tatah salad!

09:34.675 --> 09:35.974
You don't know
the difference

09:35.976 --> 09:37.876
Between 'tatah salad
and cole slaw, dre?

09:37.878 --> 09:39.711
Man, I really
don't think he do.

09:39.713 --> 09:41.680
Could not be
more basic.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.782
Aah!

09:43.784 --> 09:45.116
I got to make
a big move.

09:45.118 --> 09:46.952
I got it.

09:46.954 --> 09:49.087
I'm gonna invite jay
to my house for dinner.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.255
Brilliant.
Mm-hmm.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.324
Invite jay over
for a home-cooked meal

09:52.326 --> 09:54.359
To distract him
from how corny you are

09:54.361 --> 09:56.628
By using "those people"
you live with.

09:56.630 --> 10:00.165
"those people"
are my black family,

10:00.167 --> 10:02.167
The exact demographic
that jay's looking for.

10:02.169 --> 10:03.368
I don't understand.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.604
But I do want to come
to dinner.

10:05.606 --> 10:07.072
Absolutely not.
[ sighs ]

10:07.074 --> 10:08.907
So, what do you need me to do
for your project?

10:08.909 --> 10:10.875
You just sit there
and look pretty.

10:10.877 --> 10:12.777
I was really hoping
for junior's help.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.813
What?
But why not me?

10:14.815 --> 10:18.083
Well, no offense,
but this is an academic project,

10:18.085 --> 10:22.053
I'm academic.
I get almost straight a's.

10:22.055 --> 10:23.755
Yeah, but that's only
for looks.

10:23.757 --> 10:25.890
You don't really care
about school.
Junior: Preach!

10:25.892 --> 10:27.158
It's like I always say,

10:27.160 --> 10:29.227
"a's are like
the new skinny jeans --

10:29.229 --> 10:30.795
Everybody's getting them,

10:30.797 --> 10:32.998
But nobody really
looks good in them."

10:33.000 --> 10:33.932
Yeah.

10:33.934 --> 10:38.136
Anyway, diane, I'll lend you
my superior intellect.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.271
Sorry, jack.
Jack: I don't care.

10:40.273 --> 10:43.041
I was actually going to ask zoey
to help me.

10:43.043 --> 10:45.410
This project
is all about presentation,

10:45.412 --> 10:48.813
And nerds do not know
about presentation.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.715
Oh, so I'm a nerd?

10:50.717 --> 10:52.717
If the glasses fit.

10:52.719 --> 10:53.952
Oh, I think they fit.

10:53.954 --> 10:54.986
Mm-hmm.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.254
Tax man's coming.
What?

10:56.256 --> 10:57.989
I don't know when,
but I got to be ready.

10:57.991 --> 11:00.291
Found these in dre's closet.
Which one?

11:00.293 --> 11:02.160
I think this says "sellout."
uh-huh.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.062
And I think this says
"I'm harmless,"

11:04.064 --> 11:05.196
You know, forgettable.

11:05.198 --> 11:08.967
My daddy told me there ain't
but three things in life

11:08.969 --> 11:12.904
Stay black, pay taxes,
and die.

11:12.906 --> 11:16.741
The black-man rules
don't seem too hard.

11:16.743 --> 11:17.976
The I.R.S.
Came after my daddy,

11:17.978 --> 11:19.878
Scared his black ass
white as a ghost.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.080
Wouldn't let the poor man die
until he paid what he owed.

11:22.082 --> 11:24.883
Poor bastard
lived to be 126.

11:24.885 --> 11:28.353
Pops, I think
you're gonna be fine.

11:28.355 --> 11:32.190
There were a couple of doctors
at work that got audited,

11:32.192 --> 11:34.259
And it all worked itself out.
Really? What happened?

11:34.261 --> 11:36.027
Well, let's see.
There was dr. Davis.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.862
And he showed them
his paperwork,

11:37.864 --> 11:38.997
And they left him alone.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.198
It was no biggie.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.467
And then dr. Patel, and --
oh, yeah.

11:42.469 --> 11:43.902
What?

11:43.904 --> 11:45.737
He killed himself.

11:45.739 --> 11:47.372
But that was because
his wife left him.

11:48.374 --> 11:51.142
Because the I.R.S.
Took all his money.

11:51.144 --> 11:52.210
What else
is in that bag?

11:53.079 --> 11:54.412
Not enough.

11:55.381 --> 11:56.247
[ growls softly ]

11:56.249 --> 11:57.849
Hey, bow?
Yeah?

11:57.851 --> 11:59.417
All right,
did you get my message?

11:59.419 --> 12:01.152
Operation keepin' it real --
it's a go.

12:01.154 --> 12:04.956
But it sounded like you were
calling me from a kennel.

12:04.958 --> 12:08.927
Which now makes sense.
What happened to your hair?

12:08.929 --> 12:10.128
Huh?
No, no, no, no, no, no.

12:10.130 --> 12:11.796
This is
a "keepin' it real" evening.

12:11.798 --> 12:14.933
Hey, hey, hey.
No! Dre, stop it!
I need your curls.
I need your curls.

12:14.935 --> 12:16.234
Stop, stop!
What?

12:16.236 --> 12:18.903
Dre, I know want to keep it
super real, okay?

12:18.905 --> 12:21.272
But it took me a month
to get this appointment.

12:21.274 --> 12:22.474
Okay.
Look at it.

12:22.476 --> 12:24.743
Okay, okay, you know what?
Cornrows.

12:24.745 --> 12:26.111
I want everybody
in cornrows.

12:26.113 --> 12:28.947
We're gonna have cornrow line
from biggest to smallest.

12:28.949 --> 12:31.282
He can anchor the rear
in a do-rag.

12:31.284 --> 12:32.383
We're not braiding
our hair.

12:32.385 --> 12:35.386
You stay down here
and prepare dinner.

12:35.388 --> 12:37.255
I'll go upstairs,
and I'll get ready.

12:37.257 --> 12:40.825
Hey, whatever you do,
do not pet this dog.

12:40.827 --> 12:42.494
All right?
Or startle him.

12:42.496 --> 12:44.496
Or, god forbid,
speak spanish.

12:44.498 --> 12:46.397
He's got
a lot of triggers.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.201
So, my famous american hero
that I chose --

12:50.203 --> 12:54.139
I don't know or care anything
about your "hero,"

12:54.141 --> 12:55.440
But I think we should go

12:55.442 --> 12:58.143
With a japanese selvedge
denim and cotton blend

12:58.145 --> 12:59.911
For our costume fabric base.

12:59.913 --> 13:02.914
It says, "yeah, we're high-end,
but we're also american."

13:02.916 --> 13:05.283
Buh-bang, buh-bang!
[ exhales sharply ]

13:06.986 --> 13:08.887
Junior: We have to approach
this project

13:08.889 --> 13:11.289
With the same kind of fervor
and attention

13:11.291 --> 13:13.892
I approached my dungeon
& dragons career with.

13:13.894 --> 13:17.028
"career" feels like
a strong word.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.329
I went from level 1

13:18.331 --> 13:21.366
To creating
my own plane of existence --

13:21.368 --> 13:23.001
<i>Before</i> high school.

13:24.537 --> 13:26.571
I played this all wrong.
I played this all wrong.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.506
<i>So, jack and diane</i>
<i>had their epiphany,</i>

13:28.508 --> 13:29.941
<i>And mine was on its way,</i>

13:29.943 --> 13:32.410
<i>Which brings us back</i>
<i>to where we started.</i>

13:32.412 --> 13:34.546
<i>Time to go keep it one hundred.</i>

13:34.548 --> 13:37.048
<i>Oh, damn it!</i>
<i>I mean a hunnit!</i>

13:37.050 --> 13:39.984
So, we had to run from five-o
and hid in a dumpster.

13:39.986 --> 13:42.987
Had to stay there overnight --
in the dumpster.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.155
Hold on a second.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.824
Realness!
Shut up!

13:45.826 --> 13:47.125
My dog's name is realness.

13:47.127 --> 13:49.894
But he don't listen real good,
though, huh?

13:49.896 --> 13:52.163
He don't listen to nobody --
that's how real he is.

13:52.165 --> 13:53.231
No doubt.
Uh-huh.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.033
Respect that.
No doubt.

13:55.035 --> 13:57.535
Hey, hey, hey. Son,
what are you doing wearing that?

13:57.537 --> 13:59.971

after 6:00.

Leather jacket.

Okay, mr. Tax man,
you want to dance?

14:45.118 --> 14:46.251
We can dance.

14:48.387 --> 14:50.922
This is my take
on collard greens.

Jay: Oh, my goodness!

14:52.125 --> 14:54.058
I love me
some collard green, girl.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.560
Yeah, but they're made
out of kale.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.462
I call them
kale-ard greens.

Oh, god.

Oh, I also made
mac and cheese.

15:02.335 --> 15:03.935
I love me
some mac and cheese.

15:03.937 --> 15:07.038
But at least I'm gonna be
in the grave smilin'.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.140
Well, nobody's gonna be dying
from my mac and cheese.

15:09.142 --> 15:11.910
Of course it is.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:11.912 --> 15:13.211
You got vegan
mac and cheese?

15:13.213 --> 15:15.146
But aren't the main ingredients
butter and cheese?

15:15.148 --> 15:16.481
Yeah! [ laughs ]

15:16.483 --> 15:19.050
But I used
olive oil and teese.

15:19.052 --> 15:20.518
What?
Teese is like cheese,

15:20.520 --> 15:22.553
But it's actually --
no, no, no.

That is so brutal.

from this moment?

until I was in the prius

16:59.119 --> 17:00.018
Thanks.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.452
No, no. Thank you.

17:01.454 --> 17:02.553
And good day.

17:02.555 --> 17:04.489
Hey, pops.
What are you doing?

17:04.491 --> 17:06.124
I said,
"good day," sir.

17:10.662 --> 17:13.331
<i>So, my attempt to keep it real</i>
<i>for jay had failed.</i>

17:13.333 --> 17:14.532
<i>And my lesson on "roots"</i>

17:14.534 --> 17:16.434
<i>Wasn't faring much better.</i>
Wait.
Hmm?

17:16.436 --> 17:18.136
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:18.138 --> 17:22.407
People have been hounding me
to watch an o.J. Movie?

17:22.409 --> 17:24.542
Where the father
from "brady bunch"

17:24.544 --> 17:25.777
Plays a slave owner?

17:25.779 --> 17:27.078
[ sighs ]

17:27.080 --> 17:30.181
I'm gonna go catch up
on my "empires."

17:30.183 --> 17:32.083
[ sighs ]

17:32.085 --> 17:34.519
What you sittin' around with
your head droopin' down for?

17:34.521 --> 17:36.821
You didn't try to bribe
the wrong white guy.

17:36.823 --> 17:39.123
Pops, my career is over.

17:39.125 --> 17:42.293
I'm about to lose this account
to charlie.

17:42.295 --> 17:44.128
He lives in his car.

17:44.130 --> 17:45.663
He put a humidifier in it.

17:45.665 --> 17:46.831
Listen to me, son.

17:46.833 --> 17:48.299
Don't let some white man
convince you

17:48.301 --> 17:50.068
That your ability
to move between both worlds

17:50.070 --> 17:51.602
Is something
you shouldn't be proud of.

17:51.604 --> 17:54.806
Being able to switch it up
is a necessity.

17:54.808 --> 17:56.307
And the way you do it --

17:56.309 --> 17:58.376
Smooth, son, smooth,
like a superhero.

17:58.378 --> 17:59.844
I mean,
I'm almost jealous.

17:59.846 --> 18:01.679
How much of my scotch
have you had?

18:01.681 --> 18:04.082
Look, all I'm saying is
being able to switch it up

18:04.084 --> 18:05.817
Has gotten you
some nice things --

18:05.819 --> 18:08.820
This house, your wife,
this scotch.

18:08.822 --> 18:10.621
By the way, you're out.

18:10.623 --> 18:12.757
Ahh.
But I got to tell you.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.826
The thing I'm probably
the most proud of you for is --

18:14.828 --> 18:16.861
[ cellphone beeps, vibrates ]
oh, hold that thought.

18:16.863 --> 18:18.396
Yep, that's my uber.

18:18.398 --> 18:19.630
Got to go, son.

18:19.632 --> 18:21.365
You probably won't be seeing me
for a while,

18:21.367 --> 18:23.101
At least not until
this tax thing blows over.

18:23.103 --> 18:24.769
And I would give you
a forwarding address,

18:24.771 --> 18:26.537
But you liable to tell
the white man anything.

18:26.539 --> 18:28.539
Blessing and a curse, son.
Blessing and a curse.

18:28.541 --> 18:32.176
<i>Despite pops'</i>
<i>wesley snipes-ian understanding</i>

18:32.178 --> 18:35.146
<i>Of american tax law,</i>
<i>he was right.</i>

18:35.148 --> 18:37.882
<i>How did white jay</i>
<i>make me feel bad</i>

18:37.884 --> 18:41.853
<i>About being a successful</i>
<i>black man?</i>

18:41.855 --> 18:43.855
So, uh, these are bushes,

18:43.857 --> 18:46.791
Which is a great place where
you can hide your packages.

18:46.793 --> 18:49.127
Also, you can hide
your packages,

18:49.129 --> 18:51.529
Uh, here or...

18:51.531 --> 18:52.597
Here...

18:52.599 --> 18:54.265
Or one of my favorites...

18:54.267 --> 18:56.134
Uh, here.

18:56.136 --> 18:59.403
Hey, look.
Uh, I'm sorry to interrupt.

18:59.405 --> 19:01.606
Charlie, you can stop.
Look, the account is his.

19:01.608 --> 19:03.808
Dre, what are you doing?
All week, I've been listening

19:03.810 --> 19:05.843
To the white cornel west
over there

19:05.845 --> 19:09.714
Make me feel like I wasn't
black enough for this campaign.

19:09.716 --> 19:11.682
You know what?
Screw you.

19:11.684 --> 19:12.850
Okay. You know what?

19:12.852 --> 19:14.752
Dre, that is not
a closer move.

19:14.754 --> 19:18.589
Keepin' it real
isn't some checklist you find

19:18.591 --> 19:19.891
On "yo! Mtv raps."

19:19.893 --> 19:22.860
It's about being you,
and for me,

19:22.862 --> 19:25.863
Sometimes that mean watching
"the good wife" with the missus

19:25.865 --> 19:28.266
While we eat mac and teese,
all right?

19:28.268 --> 19:30.835
It's got my cholesterol down.
I'm off the lipitor, son.

19:30.837 --> 19:34.438
Dre, you know, I really --
I really don't think --

19:34.440 --> 19:35.873
Jay: Yes. Yes, yes.
[ claps ]

19:35.875 --> 19:37.508
This is what I wanted
to see.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.810
This is the dre johnson
I've heard so much about.

19:39.812 --> 19:41.479
You've been
walking around here

19:41.481 --> 19:45.316
You haven't given me any
of that swag you're famous for.

19:45.318 --> 19:46.851
Okay.
So, what are you saying?

19:46.853 --> 19:48.686
I want you to head up
this account.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.855
Do you? Hmm.

19:50.857 --> 19:53.691
Beg me.
Nah, I ain't doin' that,
playboy.

19:53.693 --> 19:54.926
I will.

19:54.928 --> 19:56.794
Please, dre,
take the account.

19:56.796 --> 19:57.962
Please.

19:57.964 --> 19:59.597
My back
is against the wall.

19:59.599 --> 20:00.831
Ch-charlie, I got you.

20:01.934 --> 20:04.502
All right.
I'll take it.

20:04.504 --> 20:08.239
Just make this is the guy
that shows up to work every day.

20:08.241 --> 20:09.907
All day, every day.

20:09.909 --> 20:12.343
100% uncut dre.

20:12.345 --> 20:15.313
"the white cornel west" --
I like that.

20:15.315 --> 20:18.316
Uh, do you want me
to finish?

20:18.318 --> 20:19.584
'cause me and laura,

20:19.586 --> 20:21.485
We was up late
putting this together.

20:21.487 --> 20:23.421
Like, you'll never find one
here.

20:23.423 --> 20:25.323
Uh, decoy boxes
could be awesome.

20:25.325 --> 20:26.457
Ooh, how about a wig?

20:29.695 --> 20:31.629
Hey, pops.

20:31.631 --> 20:32.763
What are you doing back?

20:32.765 --> 20:33.664
Pops: Oh, uh...

20:33.666 --> 20:37.835
If anyone comes looking for me,
I have not been here.

20:37.837 --> 20:39.837
Okay, hold on.
This letter came today.

20:39.839 --> 20:42.873
Turns out the I.R.S.
Was only sending someone here

20:42.875 --> 20:46.877
As courtesy because you are
on their senior citizen's list.

20:46.879 --> 20:49.347
They only want a copy
of the sales receipt
of your old lincoln.

20:49.349 --> 20:51.482
Your mama took that lincoln
from me in the divorce --

20:51.484 --> 20:52.850
Out of pure spite,
I might add.

20:52.852 --> 20:55.920
That means I didn't sell it --
she did.

20:55.922 --> 20:58.289
They're not looking for me.
They're looking for her.
Okay.

20:58.291 --> 20:59.490
Oh, my goodness.

20:59.492 --> 21:02.360
The I.R.S.
Is finally going to do for me

21:02.362 --> 21:04.929
What I was never able to do
for myself.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.964
What?
Bury her.

21:06.966 --> 21:08.866
I love this country.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.901
Hey, pops,
I hope this little scare

21:10.903 --> 21:13.871
Has taught you a lesson
in fiscal responsibility.

21:13.873 --> 21:15.306
Oh, yes.

21:15.308 --> 21:17.575
I am...Untouchable.

21:17.577 --> 21:20.611
If anyone comes looking for me,
you know where I'll be.

21:20.613 --> 21:21.912
At the track.
At the track.

21:21.914 --> 21:23.047
Yeah.
