WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:07.923
- Ah!
- You had the nightmare again?

00:08.080 --> 00:09.730
- Who are you?
- I'm Dr. Peacock.

00:09.880 --> 00:12.087
- Your psychiatrist, remember?
- I don't have a shrink.

00:12.280 --> 00:14.282
I've been your doctor
ever since your psychotic break.

00:14.440 --> 00:15.566
My What?

00:15.720 --> 00:17.529
- (laughs, screams)
- Meet Ashy Slashy.

00:17.680 --> 00:20.126
Let's rid ourselves of
the Necronomicon, Ash.

00:20.280 --> 00:22.647
(screams)

00:22.800 --> 00:25.041
- I didn't do this!
- You're a murderer.

00:25.200 --> 00:26.565
- No! (grunts)
- Dr. Peacock: Think it's time

00:26.720 --> 00:28.324
that we tried a new tactic.

00:28.480 --> 00:30.881
Rid yourself of the book
and the nightmare will be over.

00:31.040 --> 00:32.246
Kill the book, Ash.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.845
- (laughing maniacelly)
- (electrodes zapping)

00:34.000 --> 00:37.447
- Kill the book.
- (grunts)

00:37.640 --> 00:40.211
I think I'm losing my mind.

00:40.360 --> 00:41.361
Dr. Peacock/Baal:
You're mine now.

00:41.560 --> 00:43.085
You know what you have to do,
don't you?

00:43.920 --> 00:47.003
I must destroy the book.

00:47.760 --> 00:49.842
Pablo's voice: Jefe?

00:57.040 --> 00:58.451
(thunder rumbling)

00:58.600 --> 01:01.001
Kelly: All right,
if we actually do find him,

01:01.200 --> 01:04.602
no one can tell him it was
'cause of that stupid pet tracker.

01:04.760 --> 01:06.728
- (beeping)
- He'll never let us forget it.

01:06.920 --> 01:10.641
Come on, guys,
let's go save the world.

01:11.960 --> 01:13.530
Can I get a Ghost Beaters!

01:13.680 --> 01:15.523
(grunts)

01:15.720 --> 01:17.449
(sighs)

01:20.480 --> 01:23.802
Kelly: Well, good thing this place
isn't creepy at all.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.685
(growls)

01:34.520 --> 01:36.568
What is it?

01:36.720 --> 01:38.370
Nothing.

01:39.920 --> 01:41.365
I thought I saw something.

01:41.520 --> 01:43.522
You Okay?

01:44.480 --> 01:45.641
No, I'm not.

01:45.800 --> 01:48.087
I got a really bad feeling
about this.

01:48.240 --> 01:50.402
Really, 'cause I haven't
had a good feeling

01:50.560 --> 01:53.404
- since we met Ash and his stupid book.
- That's exactly it.

01:53.560 --> 01:56.245
The Book of the Dead
never lets anybody off easy.

01:56.400 --> 01:59.927
It's like Ash said,
everyone around him gets...

02:00.080 --> 02:01.525
dead.

02:01.720 --> 02:03.370
And now I am the book,

02:03.560 --> 02:05.528
and I can never be okay
with myself if something bad...

02:05.680 --> 02:07.489
Hey, where'd
my powerful vagina go?

02:07.640 --> 02:09.926
Huh?
(chuckles)

02:10.080 --> 02:12.287
Pablo, it's going to be
a piece of cake, all right?

02:12.480 --> 02:15.450
We'll find Ash,
you'll take out that goth demon.

02:15.600 --> 02:19.571
- And then back to Jacksonville.
- Mm, maybe not Jacksonville.

02:19.720 --> 02:21.449
But listen, you take care of this,

02:21.600 --> 02:23.364
I'll even make sure
Ash gets the first round.

02:23.520 --> 02:24.885
(scoffs)
Yeah, right.

02:27.040 --> 02:28.565
We're going to be okay.

02:28.720 --> 02:31.564
- Trust me.
- No, trust me.

02:31.720 --> 02:34.121
We are not going to be okay
if we underestimate Baal.

02:34.280 --> 02:36.931
All right? Let's go.

02:37.080 --> 02:39.526
I did what you said.
He bought it.

02:39.720 --> 02:40.926
All of it!

02:41.080 --> 02:43.162
Now, please...

02:43.320 --> 02:45.402
just let Lacey go.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.921
Emery: I brought Linda and Lacey
here like you wanted, Baal.

02:48.080 --> 02:49.923
Now, come on, you got to
keep your end of the deal.

02:50.080 --> 02:52.970
But keeping my end of the deal
is so boring.

02:53.120 --> 02:55.248
It's more fun to change things up
at the last minute.

02:55.440 --> 02:56.805
Keeps everyone on their toes.

02:56.960 --> 02:58.928
This is your fault, Thomas!

02:59.080 --> 03:00.286
Emery: No, no, no.
He said he would protect us!

03:00.440 --> 03:03.410
- All I had to do was get you here!
- No.

03:03.560 --> 03:06.131
Looks like someone's sleeping
on the couch tonight.

03:06.280 --> 03:08.726
- (thunder rumbling)
- (chuckles)

03:08.880 --> 03:11.087
(laughter echoing)

03:16.720 --> 03:18.324
Ruby:
I'll take this end.

03:24.640 --> 03:26.244
- (creaking)
" (gasps)

03:26.400 --> 03:28.402
Don't shoot.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.682
It's me, Sheriff Emery.

03:32.040 --> 03:34.964
You think knowing who you are
makes me want to shoot you any less?

03:35.120 --> 03:37.202
Shh.

03:37.400 --> 03:38.811
(whispers)
You shouldn't be here.

03:38.960 --> 03:40.405
Kelly:
Tell us where Ash is.

03:40.560 --> 03:42.289
NQW!

03:42.440 --> 03:45.410
I didn't do it.
Any of it.

03:45.560 --> 03:47.722
It was Baal.

03:47.880 --> 03:49.530
He messed with my head.

03:49.680 --> 03:51.808
Lacey: Daddy?

03:52.000 --> 03:54.970
Is that you?

03:55.120 --> 03:57.168
- Sweetheart?
- Pablo: Lacey?

03:57.320 --> 04:00.244
- (gun cocks)
- Are you...

04:01.840 --> 04:03.001
okay?

04:03.160 --> 04:05.242
Yeah, I'm okay.

04:05.400 --> 04:07.129
I mean...

04:08.280 --> 04:10.248
I could be better...

04:10.400 --> 04:13.131
if my father
didn't bring me here.

04:14.240 --> 04:16.925
Because I have to say, dying...

04:17.079 --> 04:18.684
(distorted)
totally sucks!

04:18.839 --> 04:20.649
<i>'</i> No!
<i>'</i> (grunting)

04:21.160 --> 04:22.525
Fuck!

04:22.680 --> 04:24.284
Pablo!

04:24.440 --> 04:26.363
(both grunting)

04:26.520 --> 04:28.170
Now, honey, we can fix this!

04:31.520 --> 04:33.488
(screaming)

04:33.640 --> 04:35.847
Pablo, I can't get a shot!

04:36.040 --> 04:37.724
- (Deadite Lacey laughing maniacally)
- Huh?!

04:37.920 --> 04:40.810
(yells, grunts)

04:43.120 --> 04:45.248
- Kelly: Get out of here!
- (yelling)

04:45.400 --> 04:46.925
Watch out!

04:47.080 --> 04:51.324
(shrieks)
Look, Daddy! A unicorn!

04:51.480 --> 04:53.323
- (static crackling)
- Magic is real!

04:53.520 --> 04:55.090
- Abracadabra.
- No!

04:56.560 --> 04:58.324
- Shit!
- (shrieking)

04:59.440 --> 05:01.442
Lacey!

05:01.600 --> 05:04.126
- Are you okay?
- I'm good! Find Ash!

05:05.680 --> 05:07.921
Pablo:
Ash? Ruby?

05:08.080 --> 05:09.889
Ahh!

05:10.040 --> 05:11.644
(clattering)

05:11.800 --> 05:14.644
- Deadite Lacey: Daddy?
- Lacey.

05:14.800 --> 05:16.529
(clattering continues)

05:16.680 --> 05:19.809
- Daddy.
- Lacey?

05:22.520 --> 05:24.921
What's happening to me?

05:25.080 --> 05:27.082
I don't know.

05:27.240 --> 05:30.084
- It's going to be okay.
- Promise?

05:30.240 --> 05:32.402
Kelly:
Get out of the way, Sheriff.

05:34.160 --> 05:35.764
Daddy, she wants to hurt me.

05:35.920 --> 05:38.491
That's not your daughter
anymore, Sheriff.

05:38.640 --> 05:40.563
She's still in there.

05:42.200 --> 05:44.646
- I can save her.
- No, you can't.

05:45.560 --> 05:46.641
I've been there.

05:46.800 --> 05:50.600
Now I know that we've had
our differences,

05:50.760 --> 05:55.049
but I need you to trust me
and get out of the way.

05:56.880 --> 05:59.770
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- (sighs)

05:59.960 --> 06:01.769
Daddy... I love you.

06:01.960 --> 06:04.167
I just want us
to be a family again.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.289
Oh...

06:09.440 --> 06:12.284
The only thing you sucked at
more than being the sheriff...

06:13.280 --> 06:15.442
was being a father.

06:15.640 --> 06:18.644
- (bones crack)
- No!

06:21.520 --> 06:23.522
(music playing)

06:27.240 --> 06:30.801
(shrieks) Oh, look!
He does have a backbone after all!

06:30.960 --> 06:34.169
(laughing)
Tag! You're it!

06:34.320 --> 06:36.368
(yelling)

06:37.640 --> 06:39.210
Damn it!

06:45.840 --> 06:48.525
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

06:57.920 --> 07:01.003
- (gasping)
- Tag! You're dead!

07:17.200 --> 07:18.201
- You're it.
- (shrieking)

07:20.360 --> 07:23.682
- (thunder rumbling)
- (gunfire in distance)

07:25.160 --> 07:26.400
(gasps)

07:31.360 --> 07:33.601
I'm sorry, Lacey.

07:33.800 --> 07:36.087
Sorry you got caught up
in this bullshit.

07:36.240 --> 07:39.881
And I'm sorry that your father
was a self-serving son of a bitch.

07:40.040 --> 07:41.883
You were a good kid.

07:43.680 --> 07:47.605
I'm also sorry I'm now totally alone
in this creepy ass place.

07:48.880 --> 07:50.644
Yay me.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.643
Linda: Lacey?

08:01.800 --> 08:04.087
- (laughing in distance)
- Where are you, baby?

08:05.080 --> 08:06.809
Lacey?

08:08.400 --> 08:10.368
Please answer me.

08:11.800 --> 08:14.406
(laughing in distance)

08:14.560 --> 08:16.847
Baby?
(grunts)

08:18.760 --> 08:20.569
What...

08:29.600 --> 08:30.965
Thomas?

08:31.120 --> 08:32.246
(gasps)

08:37.080 --> 08:39.003
(scraping continues)

08:47.920 --> 08:50.207
(squeaking in distance)

08:51.040 --> 08:53.122
Jefe?

09:04.240 --> 09:06.288
(breathing heavily)

09:06.480 --> 09:08.608
Oh, fuck.

09:08.760 --> 09:12.128
(voice whispers)

09:12.320 --> 09:15.529
- (gasps)
- Pablo.

09:18.240 --> 09:19.969
Um...

09:20.160 --> 09:21.969
I got a feeling whatever power
this pendant has

09:22.160 --> 09:24.811
to hold back the book
isn't going to last.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.162
I'm with you now.

09:27.320 --> 09:29.243
(creaking)

09:29.400 --> 09:30.970
(gun cocks)

09:41.240 --> 09:44.164
Oh, this is Baal's work for sure.

09:44.320 --> 09:46.004
He knows we're here.

09:47.160 --> 09:50.528
We got to get to Ash before
Baal scrambles his peanut brain.

09:50.680 --> 09:52.250
Shit.
(grunts)

09:52.440 --> 09:54.169
What is it?

09:54.360 --> 09:57.011
This is going to happen
whether we like it or not, isn't it?

09:57.160 --> 09:59.606
Look, we're going to find Baal,
you're going to harness the power

09:59.760 --> 10:01.922
of that book against him,
and none of this is going to be in vain.

10:02.120 --> 10:04.691
And you promise me that we're all
going to live happily ever after?

10:04.840 --> 10:08.003
Even if this goes perfectly,
there's a good chance you'll die.

10:08.160 --> 10:09.525
Wow.

10:09.680 --> 10:12.047
Ruby, I know you're new
to this whole mortal thing,

10:12.200 --> 10:13.964
but in our world,
where people don't live forever,

10:14.120 --> 10:16.407
the idea of dying really sucks.

10:16.560 --> 10:18.449
Well, I was just trying
to be honest.

10:18.600 --> 10:21.888
But all right, you go on thinking about
all the sweet things you're going to do,

10:22.040 --> 10:24.441
if you survive or not,
I'll find a way out of here.

10:24.640 --> 10:27.405
I do have this one idea
for a Honduran food truck

10:27.600 --> 10:29.841
that also fixes electronics.

10:30.720 --> 10:32.961
Pablito's Fish and Chips.

10:33.880 --> 10:35.405
Like computer chips.

10:35.560 --> 10:37.961
- You get it?
- No. That's awful.

10:38.120 --> 10:39.201
What else you got?

10:42.240 --> 10:45.244
Oh, good,
another pitch-black hallway.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.641
(sighs)

10:48.800 --> 10:51.087
Place is a maze.

10:52.400 --> 10:55.165
(faint breathing)

10:58.680 --> 10:59.841
(sighs)

11:04.680 --> 11:07.365
- (indistinct whispering)
- Kelly: Ash?

11:10.000 --> 11:13.447
He's not here... but he's here.

11:14.920 --> 11:16.649
And he won't get out.

11:16.800 --> 11:18.802
No matter what I do!

11:18.960 --> 11:21.804
- Get it?
- Yeah, yeah, sure I do.

11:21.960 --> 11:23.450
Hey, I'm looking for a friend.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.762
He's, uh, tall, dumb,

11:25.920 --> 11:28.127
smells like... bread.

11:28.280 --> 11:30.328
Um, oh, yeah, chainsaw arm.

11:30.480 --> 11:33.643
Probably should've led
with that one, but...

11:33.800 --> 11:37.600
♪ Ashy Slashy,
heaven and hell ♪

11:37.800 --> 11:39.882
Okay, so you know him.

11:40.040 --> 11:41.405
I know I'm not Kelly.

11:41.560 --> 11:43.801
No, I'm-- I'm Kelly.

11:43.960 --> 11:46.361
Then Ash is looking for you.

11:46.520 --> 11:48.966
Okay, good.
Where is he?

11:49.120 --> 11:52.010
Maybe he's in his room
with his... friend.

11:52.160 --> 11:54.640
All right,
now we're getting somewhere.

11:54.800 --> 11:56.370
Where is his room?

11:56.520 --> 11:58.568
(cackling)

12:04.560 --> 12:06.164
Pablo:
Quick question.

12:06.320 --> 12:09.164
What do you think Baal's been doing to
Ash this entire time he's been missing?

12:09.320 --> 12:12.563
Oh, he wants to break him...
bend him to his will.

12:12.720 --> 12:16.327
He wants Ash to destroy the book
and kill anyone who tries to stop...

12:17.000 --> 12:19.321
But... I am the book.

12:19.480 --> 12:21.403

13:28.720 --> 13:30.722
(lock clicks)

13:31.400 --> 13:33.562
Oh, come on!

13:34.320 --> 13:35.890
Shit!

13:36.080 --> 13:37.923
Ashy Slashy: Kelly...

13:38.080 --> 13:39.445
(footsteps skittering)

13:43.560 --> 13:45.369
No.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.850
(whispers)
What the fuck?

13:54.680 --> 13:56.409
- (faint whispering)
- Lacey?

13:57.360 --> 13:59.840
Baby? Oh.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.843
- (growling)
- It's Mommy.

14:03.160 --> 14:04.764
Lacey?

14:08.400 --> 14:10.289
Is that you, baby?

14:10.440 --> 14:12.363
(screaming, cackling)

14:13.600 --> 14:16.922
Ashy Slashy's got Kelly!
Won't be long now!

14:17.120 --> 14:18.610
What? Wait!

14:18.760 --> 14:20.364
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

14:24.920 --> 14:26.604
(panting)

14:26.800 --> 14:28.643
I think we lost him.

14:28.840 --> 14:30.888
I don't think so.

14:36.800 --> 14:38.689
Is he...

14:38.840 --> 14:40.808
Peeing?

14:40.960 --> 14:43.964
- That's not pee, is it?
- Nope.

14:44.120 --> 14:45.804
(chainsaw buzzing)

14:50.800 --> 14:53.690
Jefe, listen,

14:53.840 --> 14:55.569
this isn't you.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.245
It's Baal.

14:57.400 --> 14:59.767
He's controlling your mind,
all right?

14:59.960 --> 15:02.645
You got to show him
you're stronger than that, Jefe.

15:02.800 --> 15:04.768
Come on!
You can do it!

15:08.160 --> 15:10.606
No, no, no.

15:10.800 --> 15:12.802
No fucking way.

15:12.960 --> 15:15.167
Ashy Slashy: Aww, don't sweat it,
sweet cheeks, you're safe with me.

15:15.320 --> 15:16.685
- (footsteps skittering)
- Ah!

15:16.840 --> 15:19.810
- Peek-a-boo!
- What the fuck?

15:19.960 --> 15:22.770
- Wanna play?
- What? No.

15:22.920 --> 15:24.843
Ah, why am I talking
to a Muppet?

15:25.000 --> 15:26.525
(gasps)
Muppet?!

15:26.680 --> 15:28.921
Uh, well, you're awfully
judgmental for a--

15:29.080 --> 15:30.889
- Hey! For a what?
' (9395)

15:31.040 --> 15:33.008
What were you going to say,
you little motherfuck?

15:33.200 --> 15:34.611
Sack up.
What were you going to say?

15:34.760 --> 15:37.730
Wow, check out
the potty-mouth on you.

15:37.880 --> 15:40.645
You really are... filthy.

15:40.800 --> 15:42.211
And fine.

15:42.360 --> 15:44.408
Yeah, heard that one before, pervert.

15:44.560 --> 15:47.530
Girl, you're the one with your hand
all up in my puppet pooper.

15:47.680 --> 15:50.684
You want me to return the favor?

15:50.880 --> 15:53.247
(both grunting)

15:54.720 --> 15:56.643
Ah! Shit!

15:58.160 --> 16:00.162
Wait! Wait!
I-l can tell you where Ash is!

16:00.320 --> 16:02.049
- Where?
- (snarling)

16:02.200 --> 16:04.567
- Got you!
- Fuck!

16:04.720 --> 16:06.961
Whoa, whoa, oh!

16:07.120 --> 16:09.168
(laughing maniacally)

16:09.360 --> 16:13.001
Oh! Kinky.
Wish I had my fluffy cuffs.

16:13.200 --> 16:15.441
(both yelling)

16:24.560 --> 16:27.643
Oh... oh, yeah.

16:29.040 --> 16:31.122

16:31.280 --> 16:33.442
Uh, get... off!

16:33.600 --> 16:36.331
_ (laughing maniacally)
- (yelling)

16:38.920 --> 16:41.321
You filth-- fuck!

16:49.360 --> 16:50.441
Don't be so pissed.

16:50.600 --> 16:52.762
Some people pay good money
for this sort of thing, you know.

16:52.920 --> 16:55.366
(yelling)

17:00.240 --> 17:02.846
Somebody... likes it... rough!

17:04.680 --> 17:06.170
Safe word, safe word!

17:06.319 --> 17:09.642
(chuckling) I'm sorry
I'm going to have to kill you,

17:09.839 --> 17:12.127
but I think
we've both learned a lot today.

17:13.280 --> 17:14.441
- (Qaggiflg)
- Yeah.

17:14.599 --> 17:17.729
Always bring a gun
to a puppet fight.

17:24.280 --> 17:26.089
- (both panting)
- Ruby: Here!

17:27.200 --> 17:28.884
Haven't we been
down this way before?

17:29.040 --> 17:31.930
- Why would he lead us this way?
- Because it's a damned dead end.

17:33.960 --> 17:35.962
(chainsaw buzzing)

17:37.600 --> 17:40.251
Can't let Ash get you
before we find Baal.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.608
- Get in.
- (grunts)

17:45.240 --> 17:46.480
Kelly:
What the hell am I doing?

17:46.640 --> 17:50.042
I'm just-just taking orders
from everyone else.

17:50.200 --> 17:52.043
Oh, and look where that got me.

17:52.200 --> 17:55.010
Locked in a room, talking to a...

17:55.920 --> 17:57.888
dead, perverted puppet.

17:58.040 --> 18:00.964
' (gasps)
<i>'</i> Kelly?

18:02.160 --> 18:04.208
What-what are you doing here?

18:07.760 --> 18:10.240
(groans)

18:12.160 --> 18:14.481
(groans)
Damn!

18:14.640 --> 18:16.244
What the fuck was that for?!

18:16.400 --> 18:18.050
(groans)
I'm sorry.

18:18.240 --> 18:20.049
I just had to make sure
you weren't Baal.

18:20.240 --> 18:22.447
And that works?

18:22.600 --> 18:24.284
Yes?

18:24.440 --> 18:26.204
What are you doing here?

18:26.360 --> 18:29.523
I'm with Pablo and Ruby.
We're looking for Ash.

18:29.680 --> 18:31.808
- You?
- I'm looking for my family.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.207
I found Thomas and--

18:34.360 --> 18:37.330
Well, what was left of him...

18:38.720 --> 18:41.041
I haven't found Lacey yet.

18:41.200 --> 18:43.441
- Have you-- have you seen her?
- No.

18:45.200 --> 18:47.202
Linda, come with me.

18:47.360 --> 18:50.250
We finally have a way
to stop Baal.

18:50.440 --> 18:52.408
And after that...

18:53.880 --> 18:56.087
I'll help you find your daughter.

18:59.040 --> 19:01.407
Okay-

19:01.560 --> 19:03.528
(chainsaw buzzing)

19:05.720 --> 19:07.927
(whispering)
He's at the dead end.

19:08.120 --> 19:10.248
I'm going to pin him there,
you make a run for it.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.562
(whispering)
What? No, I-l can't, no.

19:12.720 --> 19:14.609
Pablo, you know
what has to be done.

19:14.760 --> 19:17.809
You find Baal,
say the incantation, send him back.

19:17.960 --> 19:19.803
I know what has to be done.

19:19.960 --> 19:21.450
I just don't know
if I'm the one to do it.

19:21.600 --> 19:23.728
You can do it.
You have to.

19:24.520 --> 19:27.285
All those fish and chips
customers are depending on it.

19:28.080 --> 19:29.605
I knew you cared.

19:29.760 --> 19:32.843
You can keep pretending like you don't,
but each day you spend as a mortal,

19:33.000 --> 19:35.082
you become
a little bit more human.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.163
- It suits you.
- That's creepy talk.

19:37.360 --> 19:38.771
Let's go.

19:38.920 --> 19:40.684
- (chainsaw buzzing faintly)
- Wait.

19:44.920 --> 19:46.809
(gasping)

19:46.960 --> 19:49.566
- (chainsaw buzzing)
- (Pablo yelling)

20:01.520 --> 20:03.921
Having a heart-to-heart?
(groans)

20:04.400 --> 20:06.528
<i>No, don't!</i>

20:06.720 --> 20:08.802
Pablo, you are our only hope.

20:08.960 --> 20:11.645
I cannot let anything happen to you,
but it's over for Ash now.

20:11.800 --> 20:13.165
No, it's not!

20:13.320 --> 20:16.529
Ash would never give up on me,
and I'm not giving up on him, all right?

20:16.680 --> 20:19.889
_ Asmg)

20:21.760 --> 20:23.762
Ash, I know the real you is in there.

20:23.920 --> 20:25.649
You're the guy who worked
at Value Stop with me,

20:25.800 --> 20:27.962
and, uh, we used to watch
"Monday Night Raw" together.

20:29.280 --> 20:31.567
Look, the point is
that we're a team, Jefe.

20:32.880 --> 20:34.006
We're a team.

20:36.720 --> 20:38.324
Ruby: Pablo, get back!

20:41.080 --> 20:42.525
- (grunting)
- Got you!

20:42.680 --> 20:43.966
Ruby: Pablo!

20:45.840 --> 20:47.330
- (lock clicks)
- Pablo!

20:48.800 --> 20:51.849
- Don't shoot me!
- Pablo...

20:52.000 --> 20:54.241
(Pablo wailing)

21:02.120 --> 21:04.122
She's dead, isn't she?

21:05.000 --> 21:06.684
- What?
- Don't.

21:06.840 --> 21:09.764
- Linda...
- Just...

21:09.920 --> 21:12.207
tell me the truth.

21:13.640 --> 21:16.211
- I'm sorry.
- (gasping, breathing heavily)

21:19.440 --> 21:21.522
I know this moment.

21:21.680 --> 21:24.570
After this,
nothing will be the same again.

21:24.760 --> 21:27.604
You will never be the same again.

21:28.720 --> 21:32.566
It can sink you lower
than you thought possible,

21:32.720 --> 21:36.566
or it can ignite a fire
inside of you.

21:39.040 --> 21:41.042
I know why you didn't tell me.

21:43.640 --> 21:45.244
You didn't think
I could handle it.

21:47.120 --> 21:49.487
You didn't think
I was strong enough.

21:50.480 --> 21:52.164
That's the same mistake
people have been

21:52.320 --> 21:54.846
making about me my entire life.

21:57.160 --> 22:00.926
And it's the last mistake that
fucking demon is ever going to make.

22:01.080 --> 22:03.082
You're damn right it is.

22:03.240 --> 22:04.765
- (Pablo wailing)
- (both gasp)

22:10.320 --> 22:12.084
- Pablo.
- Kelly.

22:12.240 --> 22:14.925
- No! Linda, you guys got to go!
- What the hell happened to you?

22:15.080 --> 22:16.605
Get out of here now! Go!

22:16.760 --> 22:19.604
- Why?
- Because I'm going to kill you.

22:20.600 --> 22:23.080
I'm going to kill all of you
and put an end to this nightmare.

22:23.240 --> 22:25.368
- (whispers) Ash?
- That's not Ash.

22:25.520 --> 22:27.921
- Baal is controlling his mind.
- Linda: Ash, no!

22:28.080 --> 22:30.526
It's me, Linda.
You know I'm real.

22:30.680 --> 22:32.170
You don't want to do this.

22:32.320 --> 22:35.130
What I want is to
destroy my delusions.

22:35.280 --> 22:37.328
Isn't that right, Dr. Peacock?

22:37.480 --> 22:39.130
(thunder rumbling)

22:39.280 --> 22:41.442
You motherfucker!
What did you do to him?!

22:41.600 --> 22:43.443
- (bones crack)
- (Linda and Kelly yelling)

22:46.200 --> 22:48.362
He can help you as much
as your husband can.

22:48.520 --> 22:50.443
Such a weak mind.

22:50.600 --> 22:54.161
Not like Ash, he took some real effort,
and it's finally paying off.

22:54.320 --> 22:58.120
So tell me, Ash, you ready to destroy
your delusions for good?

22:59.120 --> 23:02.602
Oh, no!
No, Ash, you-you can't do this!

23:03.480 --> 23:05.164
We mean something to each other!

23:05.360 --> 23:07.124
I know you feel that, too!

23:07.320 --> 23:09.561
It's all in the past now,
and so are you!

23:09.720 --> 23:11.484
- No!
- No, really, you're good, Ash!

23:11.640 --> 23:13.961
(yells, grunts)

23:14.160 --> 23:16.447
- (chainsaw turns off)
- (breathing heavily)

23:21.160 --> 23:23.322
Baal:
Ash, what are you doing?

23:23.480 --> 23:25.164
- Kill them!
- Sorry, Bill.

23:25.320 --> 23:28.005
- You played right into my hand.
- What?

23:28.160 --> 23:29.491
(Ash laughs)

23:29.640 --> 23:32.325
See my friends here thought I couldn't
get you and the book in the same room.

23:32.480 --> 23:34.403
Whoopsie,
looks like my plan worked.

23:34.560 --> 23:36.642
Both: What?

23:42.520 --> 23:44.568
What do you mean your "plan?"

23:44.720 --> 23:46.688
No, you-you remember, don't you?
Back at the house.

23:46.840 --> 23:48.080
That's a pet tracker.

23:48.280 --> 23:51.090
All I got to do is find Baal once,
I shove this down his throat,

23:51.280 --> 23:53.681
we get Pablo right up close,
he does his voodoo,

23:53.840 --> 23:55.683
and, well, the rest
will just fall into place.

23:55.840 --> 23:57.888
- (gunshot)
- That was it?

23:58.080 --> 24:00.401
- That was your entire plan?
- Don't thank me yet.

24:00.560 --> 24:03.291
We still got to send
this hairy ball sack back to hell.

24:05.200 --> 24:07.601
Little buddy, do your magic.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.570
(thunder rumbling)

24:11.760 --> 24:14.161
(chanting in Sumerian)

24:18.160 --> 24:20.208
- Ah!

24:26.520 --> 24:29.126
(gasping)

24:31.960 --> 24:34.247
Guess I'm not the only one
who underestimated you.

24:34.400 --> 24:36.004
Apology accepted.

24:36.200 --> 24:37.770
- (thunder rumbling)
- (exhales sharply)

24:37.920 --> 24:39.843
Jefe, bring him to me.

25:45.120 --> 25:47.441
Well, shit fuzzy fire,
and save the matches,

25:47.600 --> 25:48.806
you did it, Pablo!

25:48.960 --> 25:51.122
There's not enough left of him
to spread on toast.

25:51.280 --> 25:53.328
You slayed that shit, Pablo.
