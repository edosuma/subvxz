WEBVTT

00:00.078 --> 00:02.342
So this is what happened
last time on Star...

00:02.367 --> 00:04.100
No justice, no peace!

00:04.125 --> 00:05.889
I'm gonna call the ambulance
for you right now.

00:05.914 --> 00:06.980
You got the wrong guy.

00:07.015 --> 00:09.831
If you're lucky, they'll offer you a
plea deal with a minimum of five years.

00:09.856 --> 00:11.012
I might consider that.

00:11.037 --> 00:12.253
We got to get him out of this.

00:12.278 --> 00:14.462
Ain't nobody got $25,000 layin' around.

00:14.487 --> 00:16.239
You might want to donate
to a good cause.

00:16.274 --> 00:18.142
Take some money.

00:19.145 --> 00:20.845
I met a man, children.

00:20.880 --> 00:22.613
I still have a penis.

00:22.648 --> 00:24.849
I hope I don't let you down.

00:24.884 --> 00:26.016
I am a man.

00:26.052 --> 00:27.284
Say it!

00:27.320 --> 00:28.619
- Just trying to help.
- Get out.

00:28.654 --> 00:31.021
What if they come looking for us?

00:31.057 --> 00:33.023
They won't, okay?
Just put it out your head.

00:33.059 --> 00:34.658
Where's my daughter?

00:34.694 --> 00:36.060
That's rented to an Otis Leecan.

00:36.095 --> 00:37.351
Looks like we got our John Doe.

00:37.376 --> 00:39.030
There's cameras everywhere.

00:39.065 --> 00:40.765
It's called an alibi.

00:40.800 --> 00:43.300
Turns out she has mad pipes.

00:43.336 --> 00:45.504
- It's a hit.
- That new girl is fire.

00:45.536 --> 00:46.937
I'm adding Eva to the group.

00:46.973 --> 00:48.099
I quit.

00:49.976 --> 00:52.309
Lord, she's out there somewhere,

00:52.345 --> 00:54.445
hurt, upset and confused.

00:54.480 --> 00:57.915
She needs to realize
she's her own worst enemy.

00:57.950 --> 01:00.685
I got to talk some sense into this girl.

01:01.888 --> 01:04.422
Why don't you come
in the house, sweetie?

01:04.456 --> 01:06.557
You must be freezing cold.

01:06.592 --> 01:09.460
Oh, God. Cut the crap, Arlene.

01:11.564 --> 01:13.164
You don't like me, and the only
reason you haven't called

01:13.199 --> 01:14.865
the cops yet is because you know exactly

01:14.901 --> 01:17.034
what I'll them that your son did to me.

01:18.471 --> 01:21.238
Perfect, let's just act
like we normally do.

01:21.274 --> 01:22.807
Whatever issue that you have

01:22.842 --> 01:26.811
with my son can be handled,
I'm sure, very quietly.

01:26.846 --> 01:29.080
We're not gonna have any
problems as long as your son

01:29.115 --> 01:31.749
learns to keep his hands
off of me. And he will.

01:31.784 --> 01:34.085
Yes.

01:34.120 --> 01:36.587
Arlene, regardless of what you think,

01:36.622 --> 01:38.756
I like your son.

01:38.791 --> 01:41.792
And I'm gonna fix whatever it is
you messed up in him.

01:41.828 --> 01:43.194
- Oh, let me just...
- Mom. Mom, relax.

01:43.229 --> 01:45.763
- Star isn't going anywhere.
- Shut up.

01:45.798 --> 01:49.266
You will not do what your
father did to me. Am I clear?

01:50.369 --> 01:52.269
Yeah.

01:56.375 --> 01:58.576
That you're willing to take all of this

01:58.611 --> 02:01.178
says a lot about who you are.

02:07.620 --> 02:09.520
Wow.

02:09.555 --> 02:12.289
I don't know who's worse
between you and your mother.

02:12.325 --> 02:16.275
But you sure are
a weird-ass little couple.

02:18.664 --> 02:20.164
Why didn't you call me?

02:20.199 --> 02:21.966
I was home. I would've let you in.

02:22.001 --> 02:24.168
I left the group.

02:24.203 --> 02:25.369
Why?

02:25.404 --> 02:27.538
Jahil put Eva in the group.

02:27.573 --> 02:29.173
Probably sleeping with her, too.

02:29.208 --> 02:30.608
I don't know

02:30.643 --> 02:32.977
where that conniving
little lost puppy came from,

02:33.012 --> 02:35.045
but if he wants her, he can have her.

02:35.081 --> 02:37.081
What'd the girls say?

02:37.116 --> 02:39.250
I haven't talked to them
since I walked out of rehearsal,

02:39.285 --> 02:42.478
which is... the only reason
that I'm here.

02:45.091 --> 02:46.657
Don't touch me.

02:48.361 --> 02:50.594
How do you think this
is about to go, Hunter?

02:50.630 --> 02:54.064
Do you really think I haven't been
through this scenario before?

02:54.100 --> 02:55.900
I don't care what issues you have.

02:55.935 --> 02:57.668
I do not feel bad for you.

02:57.703 --> 02:59.603
And if you ever try to put
your hands on me again,

02:59.639 --> 03:03.541
I will end you and destroy your career.

03:05.478 --> 03:07.845
I'm sorry.

03:13.386 --> 03:15.986
I really appreciate you stepping in.

03:16.022 --> 03:17.822
Girl, I'm just glad you called me.

03:17.857 --> 03:20.858
We was getting robbed left and right
over there at Curls and Weaves.

03:20.893 --> 03:23.019
- Mm.
- Kids coming in with guns.

03:23.044 --> 03:25.062
I was scared to go to work.

03:25.097 --> 03:26.797
What you laughing at, Bruce?

03:26.833 --> 03:28.632
Girl, ain't nobody
stupid enough to come in here.

03:28.668 --> 03:31.902
Not with your crazy ass, the way you
keep secret weapons stashed in here.

03:33.806 --> 03:35.072
Look, I want to know why Cotton left.

03:36.976 --> 03:39.777
I want to know if your
check gonna bounce again.

03:40.708 --> 03:43.067
- God's Blessings.
- Is Cotton there?

03:43.458 --> 03:44.808
No. Cotton's not here right now.

03:44.833 --> 03:46.456
- How can I help you?
- I want to make an appointment.

03:46.481 --> 03:47.667
Where is that Latin niece of Jahil's

03:47.692 --> 03:49.437
that's supposed to be
round here helping?

03:49.462 --> 03:51.488
The only available time we got
isn't till next Friday.

03:51.524 --> 03:53.255
Next Friday?!
I need to see her tomorrow.

03:53.280 --> 03:56.293
Well, I don't need an attitude.
I told you that Cotton's not here.

03:57.363 --> 03:58.796
Hello?

03:58.831 --> 04:00.831
Girl, you know that
Star done ran off, too.

04:00.867 --> 04:01.999
Hush!

04:02.034 --> 04:03.868
Man, people be rude.

04:03.903 --> 04:05.736
Any word from her?

04:05.771 --> 04:07.938
She ain't calling me back.

04:07.974 --> 04:09.874
Jahil really got to her this time.

04:09.909 --> 04:13.244
Yeah, but Jahil was wrong
for what he did.

04:13.279 --> 04:14.111
This is crazy.

04:14.146 --> 04:16.046
Miss Carlotta?

04:16.082 --> 04:17.947
Alex is gonna take me to school today.

04:17.983 --> 04:19.483
Okay, good.

04:19.517 --> 04:22.186
I got enough going on
around here as it is.

04:24.480 --> 04:26.814
Simone, what are you doing?

04:26.839 --> 04:28.759
- Where we going?
- Hunter's.

- Wow.
- Good.

05:35.594 --> 05:36.794
'Cause I don't belong there.

05:36.829 --> 05:38.662
You know you don't.

05:39.999 --> 05:41.966
I love this song.

05:42.001 --> 05:43.968
Where'd it come from?

05:44.003 --> 05:46.203
I wrote it back in the day.

05:46.238 --> 05:48.038
You wrote it?

05:48.074 --> 05:49.940
It's hot.

05:49.976 --> 05:51.709
How come you never recorded it?

05:51.744 --> 05:54.812
I don't know, I guess
because of the Spanish.

05:54.847 --> 05:57.147
I never had no one
who could sing it before.

05:57.183 --> 05:59.216
- Huh.
- Until now.

05:59.251 --> 06:03.187
So, now you trying to connect
with your Latin roots?

06:03.222 --> 06:05.322
What's that supposed to mean?

06:05.358 --> 06:07.458
I didn't think you were about that.

06:07.493 --> 06:09.231
I don't know, I guess I always thought

06:09.256 --> 06:10.694
that having a white girl
up front and center

06:10.730 --> 06:12.796
was gonna be the thing
that rakes in the cash.

06:12.832 --> 06:15.165
But, you know, you get to
a point where it's like,

06:15.201 --> 06:16.867
maybe you're finally
even proud of who you are.

06:16.902 --> 06:18.969
- I mean me. As a Latino.
- Yeah.

06:19.005 --> 06:21.200
It ain't got to be all
about the great white way.

06:21.225 --> 06:23.340
I mean, there's this whole
beautiful Latin market

06:23.365 --> 06:25.676
out there that's just
waiting for me. For us.

06:25.711 --> 06:26.944
And it's big.

06:27.880 --> 06:29.513
Yeah.

06:30.416 --> 06:32.953
Anyway.

06:39.225 --> 06:41.225
Where's Star?

06:41.260 --> 06:42.860
I know she's here.

06:42.885 --> 06:44.061
- She's upstairs.
- Okay.

06:44.096 --> 06:47.531
Well, we'll just stand here
until she's ready to talk.

06:47.566 --> 06:48.799
Hmm.

06:48.834 --> 06:50.539
Star!

06:50.905 --> 06:52.104
Star!

06:52.304 --> 06:53.570
Sta...

06:56.275 --> 06:58.509
I'm gonna shower.

07:00.880 --> 07:03.280
Why haven't you been answering
my phone calls?

07:03.315 --> 07:05.082
'Cause I wasn't ready to talk to you.

07:05.117 --> 07:07.351
And because you've
already taken your side.

07:07.386 --> 07:08.886
What's that even supposed to mean?

07:08.921 --> 07:11.288
Neither one of you
had a damn thing to say

07:11.323 --> 07:13.524
when Jahil decided
to put Eva in the group.

07:13.559 --> 07:16.293
Okay, well, none of us knew about it,
it was a shock to both of us.

07:16.328 --> 07:18.495
Well, we sure had different
reactions to it, didn't we?

07:18.531 --> 07:20.197
We're not here to fight. All right?

07:20.232 --> 07:21.565
Just come home.

07:21.600 --> 07:23.300
We have things to figure out.

07:23.335 --> 07:25.469
It's nothing to figure out, Alex.

07:25.504 --> 07:28.372
If JLo's in, I'm out. That's it.

07:31.810 --> 07:33.410

09:40.606 --> 09:42.172
Nah, you always
got my back with the girls,

09:42.207 --> 09:45.075
so I got you.

09:45.110 --> 09:47.277
Look, I didn't know you worked
this shift, at the club.

09:47.313 --> 09:50.314
I don't. I came trying
to pick up some more hours.

09:50.349 --> 09:52.015
What did Maggie say?

09:52.051 --> 09:53.583
No.

09:53.619 --> 09:55.686
Well, between working here,
and at your mom's

09:55.721 --> 09:57.554
and that little side hustle you got,

09:57.589 --> 09:59.256
I figure you'd be stacking paper.

09:59.291 --> 10:00.691
I quit.

10:00.726 --> 10:03.160
Quit Carlotta's?

10:03.195 --> 10:04.728
And that side hustle.

10:04.763 --> 10:06.496
What?

10:06.532 --> 10:07.998
No. Come on.

10:08.033 --> 10:09.733
Whoa!

10:09.768 --> 10:11.234
Yeah, I had to get out of there.

10:11.259 --> 10:13.877
No, look. I get it.
You know, leaving your mom,

10:13.906 --> 10:15.739
and that whole born again thing.

10:15.774 --> 10:19.376
But you sure you ready
to give up the life?

10:19.411 --> 10:22.212
Yeah, it's time.

10:22.247 --> 10:23.947
I mean, I hate it here.

10:23.982 --> 10:25.882
I can't stand these hoes.

10:25.918 --> 10:27.584
♪ All there, yeah... ♪

10:27.619 --> 10:29.653
Hey, I need a place to stay.

10:29.688 --> 10:32.556
Do you know anybody
maybe with an extra room?

10:32.591 --> 10:33.790
♪ All there... ♪

10:33.826 --> 10:35.925
You know what? Actually, I do.

10:40.733 --> 10:43.286
Damn, baby. Look at you.
Looking fine as ever.

10:43.311 --> 10:45.141
- How you doing?
- What's up, babe?

10:45.404 --> 10:46.903
Oh, hell no, Jahil.

10:46.939 --> 10:48.138
She can't stay here.

10:48.173 --> 10:49.339
Hey, I know I didn't
tell you who it was,

10:49.375 --> 10:51.441
but we take care of each other, right?

10:51.477 --> 10:52.809
Yeah.

10:52.845 --> 10:53.944
And I've been good to you?

10:53.979 --> 10:54.979
You have.

10:55.013 --> 10:56.546
You'll let me make it up to you?

10:56.582 --> 10:57.981
Yeah.

10:58.016 --> 10:59.649
Just let her stay for like a second.

10:59.685 --> 11:01.551
I'm gonna make it up to you,

11:01.587 --> 11:03.854
in a special way,
you know what I'm saying?

11:03.889 --> 11:04.924
- Hmm?
- All right.

11:04.949 --> 11:08.096
But I want you to know
that I'm only doing this for Jahil.

11:08.121 --> 11:11.256
I can't believe I'm letting
this bitch stay in my house.

11:13.732 --> 11:16.833
Hey, thank you, baby.
You know I love you, right?

11:18.771 --> 11:21.772
- Really?
- What?

11:28.747 --> 11:32.716
What can I do to make you feel better?

11:32.751 --> 11:36.353
I don't know, you could start
with not hitting me?

11:41.059 --> 11:43.193
Why, why are we laughing?

11:45.464 --> 11:49.499
You know you can stay here
as long as you want.

11:49.535 --> 11:51.935
It's just gonna be a few days.

11:51.970 --> 11:53.804
I really can't leave my sister,

11:53.839 --> 11:56.106
but I got to grab
a few things from the salon,

11:56.141 --> 11:57.974
so it'll be like five minutes, cool?

11:58.010 --> 11:59.543
Cool.

11:59.578 --> 12:01.645
I think we got through to her.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.781
She knows she needs us.

12:04.817 --> 12:08.852
You really think Star knows
that she needs somebody?

12:08.887 --> 12:11.188
Actually, yes.

12:11.223 --> 12:13.256
She's smart-ish.

12:13.292 --> 12:16.860
She's gonna kick us to the curb
one day, but for now,

12:16.895 --> 12:19.729
she knows good and well she needs us.

12:19.765 --> 12:21.832
We all need each other.

12:24.870 --> 12:28.505
I'm not gonna take the plea.

12:28.540 --> 12:30.841
I'm not guilty.

12:30.876 --> 12:35.245
So, I might as well go to
a trial, take my chances.

12:35.280 --> 12:37.180
So what if it is a risk?

12:40.819 --> 12:43.153
Now you're talking
like you got some sense.

12:50.762 --> 12:52.829
Get in the house, right now!

12:52.865 --> 12:55.198
What are they doing here?

12:55.234 --> 12:57.033
I don't know.

12:59.000 --> 13:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here

13:09.248 --> 13:11.047
Hold up, what y'all want?

13:11.083 --> 13:13.950
Detective Batista, Atlanta Homicide.

13:13.986 --> 13:15.318
We're looking for Carlotta Brown.

13:15.354 --> 13:16.753
Can I help you?

13:16.788 --> 13:19.360
Juanita Phillips, with Child Services.

13:19.385 --> 13:22.110
Miss, you don't understand.
I can explain everything.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.102
Simone, I'm gonna
need you to come with me.

13:24.127 --> 13:26.663
No, you're crazy if you think
I'm going back there.

13:26.698 --> 13:28.565
Miss Carlotta, do something.
They can't just take her.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.000
Simone, please,
don't make this difficult.

13:30.035 --> 13:31.835
Miss Carlotta, please don't
let them take me away.

13:31.870 --> 13:34.124
Look, don't do this. The-The
girl has been through enough.

13:34.149 --> 13:36.155
- Simone! No!
- No, I said I ain't going there!

13:36.180 --> 13:38.382
No! Don't take her!

13:38.406 --> 13:40.406
You can't take her!

13:43.415 --> 13:44.681
Carlotta!

13:44.716 --> 13:46.316
No! Get off of her!

13:46.351 --> 13:47.751
- C, no! C!
- Let her go!

13:47.776 --> 13:49.653
- Get off of me!
- She don't want to go with you.

13:49.688 --> 13:50.987
Miss Carlotta, please!

13:54.297 --> 13:55.940
What'd I do?

13:55.965 --> 13:59.266
Nothing, you just got me tripping.

13:59.302 --> 14:00.901
Well, you can trip.

14:00.937 --> 14:03.304
You deserve it.

14:07.009 --> 14:09.209
You know, you're the real thing, Cotton.

14:09.245 --> 14:11.145
You live your life by your own rules,

14:11.180 --> 14:14.048
and you don't give a damn
if people don't get it.

14:14.083 --> 14:16.517
It's taken me a long time to get there.

14:18.688 --> 14:20.788
Look, I got to ask you something.

14:25.027 --> 14:26.961
Do you have HIV?

14:26.996 --> 14:29.897
No. No, and I'm on PrEP.

14:33.703 --> 14:35.869
Are you still hooking?

14:38.441 --> 14:40.507
Yeah.

14:40.543 --> 14:42.209
You still got a pimp?

14:44.547 --> 14:46.313
Come on, Elliot.

14:46.349 --> 14:48.115
Look at this face, baby.

14:48.150 --> 14:50.451
Does this look like the face
of a street walker to you?

14:57.960 --> 15:00.461
Sometimes I don't know. I just...

15:00.496 --> 15:02.229
I feel like another john.

15:02.264 --> 15:07.701
No, baby, you mean
so much more than that.

15:15.645 --> 15:19.680
Here, if you want me
to stop hooking, okay.

15:21.517 --> 15:23.917
I want you all to myself.

15:30.383 --> 15:31.960
Okay.

15:32.228 --> 15:34.194
I'll answer any question you want.

15:34.230 --> 15:36.563
Please, just tell me
where you took Simone.

15:36.599 --> 15:38.699
She's being taken care of.

15:38.734 --> 15:41.048
This is crazy. I can't believe
you guys are doing this.

15:41.073 --> 15:43.170
- Do you know what happened to her?
- We're doing our job.

15:43.205 --> 15:45.806
Y'all can't let that girl
go back into the system.

15:47.176 --> 15:48.475
You knew Simone was a runaway

15:48.511 --> 15:51.048
and you never reported it
to authorities?

15:51.345 --> 15:53.280
My babies just showed up here
out the blue.

15:53.315 --> 15:55.149
They needed me.

15:55.184 --> 15:58.352
So, Simone didn't come alone.

15:58.387 --> 16:00.220
Her sister, Star, came, too.

16:03.025 --> 16:05.325
Right now you're being considered

16:05.361 --> 16:07.861
as a person of interest
in the murder of Otis Leecan.

16:11.801 --> 16:13.400
Now, I'm gonna give you a minute.

16:13.436 --> 16:14.768
Collect your thoughts.

16:14.804 --> 16:16.136
And when I come back in,

16:16.172 --> 16:17.692
you're gonna start from the beginning.

16:19.809 --> 16:21.942
What you think you gonna find?

16:33.489 --> 16:36.056
What the hell is this?

16:36.092 --> 16:37.391
Hunter, stop the car.

16:44.166 --> 16:46.166
Girl, go on in there!
I don't know what's going on.

16:46.202 --> 16:48.135
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

16:50.239 --> 16:51.672
Excuse me, ma'am!

16:51.707 --> 16:53.729
- Ma'am!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

16:53.754 --> 16:55.743
- You can't be here.
- I can be here. I live here.

16:55.778 --> 16:56.944
I understand that, but there's
an investigation going on.

16:56.979 --> 16:58.078
I need to see Miss Carlotta.

16:58.114 --> 17:00.126
This is her salon
and I live in this house,

17:00.151 --> 17:02.009
- so I'm going inside. Thank you.
- Who do you think you're talking to?

17:02.034 --> 17:03.217
- Are you touching me now?
- Relax.

17:03.252 --> 17:04.837
- Did you just touch me?
- Star, right?

17:04.862 --> 17:06.453
Yeah.

17:06.489 --> 17:08.888
I'm Detective Batista.
Why don't you come inside?

17:08.924 --> 17:11.157
To my own house? Thank you so much.

17:11.193 --> 17:12.459
Miss Brown's in the kitchen.

17:15.464 --> 17:17.097
Where is Simone?

17:18.701 --> 17:19.833
Where's Simone?

17:19.868 --> 17:21.001
Look, Star...

17:21.036 --> 17:22.402
Yo, you're scaring me. Where is she?

17:22.438 --> 17:24.238
Carlotta, where is Simone?

17:24.272 --> 17:25.405
She's gone.

17:26.242 --> 17:28.942
Child Protective Services took her.

17:30.913 --> 17:32.513
You were supposed to protect us.

17:32.548 --> 17:34.648
I'm sorry, there was nothing I could do.

17:38.988 --> 17:42.022
You can't keep me in here like this.

17:42.057 --> 17:44.258
I need to see my sister.

17:44.293 --> 17:46.360
Take a seat.

17:48.164 --> 17:50.931
Please.

18:05.681 --> 18:08.415
I can't believe this is happening.

18:08.450 --> 18:12.286
The police isn't telling me too much,

18:12.321 --> 18:14.588
but they think that someone
in Miss Brown's house

18:14.623 --> 18:16.657
might've been the one
that murdered Otis.

18:19.562 --> 18:22.262
This isn't going away, Simone.

18:22.298 --> 18:24.398
You need to talk to me.

18:29.205 --> 18:31.138
Otis was last seen in Atlanta.

18:31.173 --> 18:33.874
Did he try to make contact with you?

18:33.909 --> 18:35.809
But you ain't white, Simone.

18:35.845 --> 18:38.078
You ain't no better
than anybody else in this house.

18:38.113 --> 18:41.215
When was the last time you saw him?

18:42.518 --> 18:44.384
The police think that he came to Atlanta

18:44.420 --> 18:45.819
to try to find you.

18:45.855 --> 18:47.487
Don't matter where you are.

18:47.523 --> 18:50.490
I'm gonna always find you.

18:50.526 --> 18:53.498
Because you belong to me, Simone.

18:53.523 --> 18:55.996
Y'all didn't do nothing, so I did.

18:59.201 --> 19:01.034
What are you saying, Simone?

19:03.606 --> 19:07.040
I killed Otis.

19:08.205 --> 19:10.172
You killed Mr. Leecan?

19:11.508 --> 19:13.942
I took Miss Carlotta's gun and shot him.

19:14.521 --> 19:17.312
You realize you're confessing a murder.

19:17.810 --> 19:19.589
Yes.

19:19.750 --> 19:22.011
And I would do it again.

19:22.286 --> 19:24.246
Why didn't you come to me?

19:24.454 --> 19:25.921
I could've helped you.

19:25.956 --> 19:27.155
Had you put in another home.

19:27.190 --> 19:29.691
Have it happen all over again?

19:29.726 --> 19:33.295
You know that ain't the first time
a foster father has raped me.

19:47.444 --> 19:49.978
So, the three of you girls
came here to do music?

19:50.013 --> 19:52.647
- Where is my sister?
- She's fine.

19:52.683 --> 19:54.749
Simone's at the police station
with her social worker.

19:54.785 --> 19:57.118
- I would like to see her now.
- We'll get to that.

19:57.154 --> 19:59.988
How were you able
to track down Carlotta Brown?

20:00.023 --> 20:01.890
She's a friend of my mother's.

20:01.925 --> 20:04.759
But you hadn't seen her
in years, so how'd you find her?

20:04.795 --> 20:05.961
The Internet.

20:05.996 --> 20:07.262
Through the salon.

20:08.999 --> 20:11.399
You girls seem very determined.

20:11.435 --> 20:13.435
Not gonna let anyone stand in your way.

20:13.470 --> 20:16.338
What's that supposed to mean?

20:16.373 --> 20:18.773
Otis was stabbed
at the same time that his car

20:18.809 --> 20:20.375
and his foster daughter went missing.

20:20.410 --> 20:22.610
Then the three of you
show up here in Atlanta.

20:22.646 --> 20:25.480
That's one hell of a
coincidence, wouldn't you say?

20:26.717 --> 20:29.117
Yeah, it seems like it.

20:31.822 --> 20:33.154
Excuse me.

20:38.528 --> 20:40.128
Now is not a good time.

20:40.163 --> 20:41.329
Yo, what's going on?

20:41.365 --> 20:43.531
What's the deal with all the cops?

20:43.567 --> 20:45.433
Where are you?

20:45.469 --> 20:46.468
I'm parked down the street.

20:46.503 --> 20:48.903
They're in here searching around,

20:48.939 --> 20:50.572
questioning us.

20:52.309 --> 20:53.608
I mean, this whole damn thing

20:53.643 --> 20:55.510
could potentially blow up in our faces.

20:55.545 --> 20:57.145
Which is why you should
turn your ass around

20:57.180 --> 20:58.313
and get out of here right now.

21:00.517 --> 21:02.751
Got to go.

21:02.786 --> 21:04.519
Make sure you look deep, brother.

21:04.554 --> 21:06.788
Hey, Batista, come take a look.

21:06.823 --> 21:09.391
Excuse me.

21:19.469 --> 21:22.162
I think we found
what we were looking for.

21:24.408 --> 21:26.771
What if I go to jail?

21:27.177 --> 21:29.644
I don't want to go to jail.

21:30.847 --> 21:32.580
I don't want to go to jail.

24:09.644 --> 24:11.361
Name as it appears
on the driver's license,

24:11.479 --> 24:13.342
Carlotta Brown.

24:14.119 --> 24:15.711
Miss Brown.

24:19.617 --> 24:21.454
I-I can't believe this is happening.

24:21.541 --> 24:22.773
I know.

24:25.890 --> 24:28.090
I got to call Cotton.

24:32.412 --> 24:34.297
How many times I got to tell you?

24:34.332 --> 24:35.831
I don't know Otis Leecan.

24:35.867 --> 24:37.934
You're lying.

24:37.969 --> 24:39.201
What makes you think that?

24:39.237 --> 24:41.037
Cut the crap, Carlotta.

24:41.072 --> 24:43.973
We have surveillance
footage of the hair show.

24:44.008 --> 24:47.076
It shows you interacting
with Mr. Leecan.

24:47.111 --> 24:49.712
Man, I spoke to hundreds
of people that night.

24:51.749 --> 24:54.317
You know what's interesting
about that footage?

24:56.354 --> 24:59.422
Your interaction with Otis is
the last time he was seen alive.

24:59.457 --> 25:02.158
So what that got to do with me?

25:02.193 --> 25:04.160
We know you wrote letters
to Social Services

25:04.195 --> 25:05.995
begging for the custody of those kids.

25:06.030 --> 25:08.998
You said you'd do anything to get them.

25:10.368 --> 25:13.235
I think that included
killing Mr. Leecan.

25:16.407 --> 25:18.174
Do I need a lawyer?

25:18.209 --> 25:19.609
You will...

25:19.644 --> 25:21.777
if the ballistics report
on the gun that we found

25:21.813 --> 25:23.946
at your home turns out
to be the murder weapon.

25:23.982 --> 25:26.449
It's funny.

25:26.484 --> 25:28.317
On paper, you seem to be

25:28.353 --> 25:31.487
a hardworking, Bible-thumping,
Christian woman.

25:35.059 --> 25:37.493
But a zebra can't change its stripes.

25:37.528 --> 25:40.229
Can it, Carlotta?

25:49.240 --> 25:53.042
I just keep thinking about
the first time we got separated.

25:53.077 --> 25:56.779
I'm not about to let it happen again.

25:58.249 --> 26:01.617
She's all that I've got left.

26:01.653 --> 26:03.419
Yeah, well, you've got me, too.

26:03.454 --> 26:06.455
And clearly, I'm not going anywhere.

26:11.829 --> 26:14.096
This is all your fault,

26:14.132 --> 26:15.931
- and I hope you know that.
- Don't even try it, Star.

26:15.967 --> 26:18.434
You put her in the house
with that sick man.

26:18.469 --> 26:19.880
If you hadn't had done that,
she wouldn't be here.

26:19.905 --> 26:21.037
Look, calm down and listen to me.

26:21.072 --> 26:23.239
I'm not about to calm down, Juanita!

26:23.274 --> 26:26.242
I begged you for how many
years to let me have her.

26:26.277 --> 26:28.277
- I could've protected her.
- I was doing my job.

26:28.312 --> 26:30.184
All you did was help
the courts keep us separated!

26:30.209 --> 26:31.447
I'm the reason you two are together now.

26:31.482 --> 26:33.916
You're the reason
we were torn apart again!

26:33.951 --> 26:36.218
Simone just confessed
to killing that man.

26:39.924 --> 26:41.257
I'm gonna call my lawyer.

26:41.292 --> 26:43.826
Juanita... you got
to let me talk to her.

26:43.861 --> 26:46.068
You got to let me talk to her
because she doesn't understand

26:46.093 --> 26:47.247
what's going on. She's scared, okay?

26:47.272 --> 26:48.794
There's nothing else I
can do to help you, Star.

26:48.819 --> 26:49.965
She's just making stuff up
because she's af...

26:50.001 --> 26:53.502
I already turned over Simone's
confession to Detective Batista.

26:53.538 --> 26:54.603
Why would you...?

26:54.639 --> 26:56.806
It is out of my hands right now.

27:11.355 --> 27:13.823
Daughter's here to see you.

27:24.769 --> 27:26.302
You okay?

27:27.739 --> 27:29.472
I'm fine.

27:31.909 --> 27:34.243
Cotton, I'm so sorry about everything.

27:34.278 --> 27:37.446
Look, I'm not here
to fix anything with you.

27:37.482 --> 27:40.449
I just wanted to make sure
you was all right.

27:40.485 --> 27:43.119
Cotton, you don't understand.

27:43.154 --> 27:45.654
No, I do understand.

27:45.690 --> 27:48.190
You abandoned me when I was little.

27:48.226 --> 27:50.459
And then you chose
your pastor and your church

27:50.495 --> 27:52.728
over your own child.

27:54.365 --> 27:58.267
What he did... was wrong.

27:58.302 --> 28:02.371
And I got to live with that.

28:02.406 --> 28:04.106
Me, too.

28:08.713 --> 28:11.347
How them girls doing? I'm worried.

28:14.418 --> 28:16.318
Mama, you in jail.

28:16.354 --> 28:19.188
Why don't you stop thinking
about those girls for one second

28:19.223 --> 28:21.223
and start thinking about yourself?

28:21.259 --> 28:24.794
What's gonna happen if
charges is brought against you?

28:24.829 --> 28:26.829
And what's gonna happen to me?

28:26.864 --> 28:30.833
And don't I deserve a mother, too?

28:34.839 --> 28:38.274
You know what, I can't even do this.

28:39.811 --> 28:41.944
Cotton.

28:43.481 --> 28:45.281
Wait.

28:52.056 --> 28:54.390
But you're my baby.

28:59.363 --> 29:01.496
All right.

29:03.830 --> 29:05.897
Batista, I need to talk to you.

29:05.932 --> 29:07.899
Simone didn't do it.

29:07.934 --> 29:09.667
She didn't kill Otis.

29:10.114 --> 29:12.547
I know what she's saying to you,
but she's just scared.

29:12.572 --> 29:14.372
She's just telling you
whatever it is you want to hear.

29:14.407 --> 29:16.507
She seemed pretty adamant.

29:16.542 --> 29:18.175
She said she took Miss Brown's gun

29:18.200 --> 29:20.584
- and shot him.
- Okay, well, she didn't.

29:20.824 --> 29:22.967
She didn't do it. I did.

29:23.616 --> 29:25.857
I got to give it to all three of you.

29:25.985 --> 29:27.450
Nice try.

29:27.475 --> 29:28.753
What?

29:28.788 --> 29:30.955
The ballistics report came in.

29:30.990 --> 29:34.192
The gun we found on Miss Brown's
property was never fired.

29:34.227 --> 29:37.995
None of the bullets match the
ones recovered at the autopsy.

29:38.031 --> 29:39.730
We know Simone was lying.

29:39.766 --> 29:41.365
She didn't kill Otis,

29:41.401 --> 29:43.801
and neither did you.

29:49.175 --> 29:52.276
So, when do I get to see my sister?

29:52.312 --> 29:54.278
Right this way.

30:14.734 --> 30:16.701
I'm sorry.

30:17.637 --> 30:19.291
I'm sorry.

30:20.306 --> 30:22.440
It's over.

30:23.388 --> 30:24.620
It's over.

30:25.947 --> 30:27.778
What do you...?

30:27.814 --> 30:29.780
What do you mean?

30:29.816 --> 30:32.183
They know you didn't kill Otis.

30:33.052 --> 30:37.989
Star, I'm so confused.
I... I thought I actually killed him.

30:38.024 --> 30:39.523
I took Miss Carlotta's gun

30:39.559 --> 30:41.225
and you took it out of my hands and...

30:41.261 --> 30:43.361
I know. I know.

30:43.396 --> 30:45.596
But the bullets didn't match.

30:46.499 --> 30:48.176
It wasn't you.

30:51.918 --> 30:54.723
Then-then who killed Otis?

30:56.176 --> 30:58.109
Oh, my God.

31:01.214 --> 31:03.014
What's going on? Where's
Simone? Is she all right?

31:03.049 --> 31:05.750
She's fine. She's with Star.

31:05.785 --> 31:08.185
You can go, Ms. Brown.

31:08.221 --> 31:10.087
Just like that?

31:10.123 --> 31:12.824
We'll be holding on
to your gun due to your prior.

31:15.094 --> 31:17.676
- What about Simone? Can she...?
- I'm gonna request

31:17.701 --> 31:19.530
the judge grant you
temporary guardianship,

31:19.565 --> 31:21.499
pending a formal hearing.

31:22.232 --> 31:24.466
Praise God.

31:26.339 --> 31:28.306
We need to do what's right by Simone.

31:28.341 --> 31:30.741
And right now, that's being with you.

31:32.812 --> 31:34.512
I let these girls down once.

31:34.547 --> 31:36.681
I won't do it again.

31:41.353 --> 31:44.134
Today turned out to be your lucky day.

31:44.524 --> 31:47.509
I hope you find whoever did that
to Mr. Leecan.

31:47.727 --> 31:50.161
Trust me, I will.

31:58.972 --> 32:01.105
It's good seeing you again, sweetheart.

32:01.140 --> 32:03.307
I'll give you a call
next time I'm in town.

32:03.343 --> 32:05.943
- Thank you, babe.
- Mm-hmm.

32:20.560 --> 32:22.387
Who was that?

32:22.562 --> 32:24.450
Nobody.

32:24.839 --> 32:27.177
Now you're just lying to me.

32:29.208 --> 32:32.677
- I can explain, Elliot...
- You said you were working late.

32:33.206 --> 32:35.248
Figured I'd surprise you.

32:38.044 --> 32:40.077
You told me you quit.

32:40.113 --> 32:41.979
I did.

32:42.015 --> 32:43.914
But you know my surgery is coming up.

32:43.950 --> 32:45.850
I had to stop working at the salon.

32:45.885 --> 32:48.285
Look, I didn't have a choice.

32:48.321 --> 32:50.943
We all have choices.

32:52.091 --> 32:54.045
What I liked about you most...

32:55.428 --> 32:57.803
...was you lived in your truth.

33:01.901 --> 33:03.834
I told you you were beautiful.

33:05.671 --> 33:07.171
I had you wrong.

33:07.206 --> 33:09.273
No, you don't. Baby, don't say that.

33:09.308 --> 33:11.042
Stop. Elliot, stop.

33:11.077 --> 33:14.278
I think you enjoy what you do.

33:17.518 --> 33:18.884
Elliot.

33:19.360 --> 33:20.951
Elliot.

33:32.914 --> 33:34.713
Baby, I...

33:36.611 --> 33:38.244
Can we talk?

33:38.930 --> 33:40.563
What do you want?

33:43.284 --> 33:45.039
Can I come in?

33:58.066 --> 34:00.220
My man just left me today.

34:00.335 --> 34:01.868
I ain't in the mood for you.

34:02.033 --> 34:04.580
Come home, babe, please.

34:05.440 --> 34:08.641
This-this has gone far enough...

34:10.045 --> 34:13.612
You've been embarrassed of me
since day one.

34:13.648 --> 34:16.516
I mean, you just tolerate me.

34:16.551 --> 34:19.552
Me coming home is to feed your guilt.

34:21.690 --> 34:23.656
I'm not embarrassed by you.

34:25.126 --> 34:26.859
You are a kind,

34:26.895 --> 34:29.462
and loving spirit,

34:29.496 --> 34:32.565
despite everything
that you've been through.

34:34.536 --> 34:37.469
That I've put you through.

34:39.455 --> 34:41.554
Do you know how it feels every time

34:41.580 --> 34:43.947
I think about what these men do to you?

34:45.735 --> 34:47.735
It breaks my heart.

34:47.938 --> 34:50.516
You know how I feel to do it?

34:50.552 --> 34:52.485
Do you?

34:54.456 --> 34:57.557
Oh, you think I like it?

34:57.592 --> 35:01.994
It makes my skin crawl.

35:02.030 --> 35:05.932
And you know how long I been doing it?

35:05.967 --> 35:07.433
Hmm?

35:07.469 --> 35:10.403
Since I was 12.

35:16.945 --> 35:18.711
Just get out.

35:20.615 --> 35:23.116
All right, this is my house now.

35:23.151 --> 35:26.686
Go tend to your other daughters.

35:28.089 --> 35:29.522
Cotton.

35:29.557 --> 35:30.923
Just get out!

35:30.959 --> 35:33.126
Get out.

35:33.161 --> 35:35.394
Just leave me alone.

36:00.155 --> 36:02.588
Don't tell me you using again.

36:02.624 --> 36:04.590
Well, then I won't tell you.

36:07.061 --> 36:09.729
You don't need that.

36:10.765 --> 36:14.534
I want you to look at these lyrics.

36:14.569 --> 36:15.868
Okay...

36:15.904 --> 36:19.438
I wrote it when Derek was arrested.

36:20.060 --> 36:22.327
I mean, I haven't worked
on it in a few days,

36:22.432 --> 36:24.721
but with everything
that's gone on today,

36:24.846 --> 36:27.146
I got inspired to finish it.

36:27.815 --> 36:29.682
