WEBVTT

00:02.371 --> 00:04.904
-<i> Previously on</i> The Strain...
- If you guys stay, you'll die.

00:04.906 --> 00:07.907
- Will you come with us?
-<i> You can save her, Gus. But</i>

00:07.909 --> 00:11.243
the only way is to give her up.
- Tell me who has the book.

00:11.245 --> 00:13.745
- Rudyard Fonescu.

00:13.747 --> 00:17.148
-<i> The boy from the convent.</i>
- Rudyard! Run!

00:17.150 --> 00:19.583
(quick breathing)

00:19.585 --> 00:21.743
- Nothing is more
important than the<i> Lumen!</i>

00:21.769 --> 00:23.853
 We must find it before
somebody else does!

00:23.855 --> 00:26.222
<i> It is said to be cursed,</i>
<i> bringing death and disaster</i>

00:26.224 --> 00:29.258
<i> to anyone who reads it, but</i>
<i> I'm willing to take that risk.</i>

00:29.260 --> 00:31.093
- I'm going to kill
Eldritch Palmer.

00:31.095 --> 00:33.595
- Sniper his ass?
- We need a clean shot.

00:33.597 --> 00:36.164
We'll never get another chance.
Now! Do it!

00:36.166 --> 00:39.066
(gunshot)
(screaming)

00:39.068 --> 00:41.101
Go!

00:42.604 --> 00:45.037
(sirens)
- Freeze! Stay right there!

00:45.039 --> 00:47.339
- Hold on a second!
I'm the one that you want!

00:47.341 --> 00:49.574
(snarling and screeching)

00:49.576 --> 00:51.542
(sizzling)

00:51.544 --> 00:53.677
- Where's Dutch?
- Mayfield Hotel.

00:53.679 --> 00:56.079
(screaming)

01:04.221 --> 01:06.955
(clinking)

01:28.744 --> 01:31.677
- Dutch Velders.

01:33.113 --> 01:35.780
I brought you some company.

01:40.919 --> 01:43.286
(choking sounds)

01:43.288 --> 01:46.889
I always enjoyed schnapps.

01:46.891 --> 01:49.524
Especially on a cold day.

01:52.262 --> 01:54.495
(glass shattering)

01:57.933 --> 02:00.967
(shriek)
(moaning)

02:12.679 --> 02:15.479
(crunch)
(thumping)

02:21.987 --> 02:24.620
Every once in a while

02:24.622 --> 02:27.489
I enjoy a human cocktail.

02:27.491 --> 02:32.025
(whimpering)
It relaxes me.

02:32.027 --> 02:35.061
- What are you going
to do to me?

02:38.266 --> 02:41.500
- Everything.

02:44.004 --> 02:46.504
(theme music)

03:10.062 --> 03:13.896
(heavy breathing)
(distant siren)

03:13.898 --> 03:16.031
(distant bang)

03:27.143 --> 03:31.445
(hollow scraping)

03:33.582 --> 03:38.151
- That is not going to work.
- Show yourself.

03:47.828 --> 03:52.362
Where did you get that book?
- I'll ask the questions.

03:52.364 --> 03:54.597
Who are you?

03:54.599 --> 03:57.199
- Your ear.

03:57.201 --> 03:59.401
Your father burned it
against a stove

03:59.403 --> 04:03.337
when you were a young boy.
Am I right, Rudyard?

04:03.339 --> 04:05.272
- Who told you that?

04:05.274 --> 04:10.076
- In 1966, a man arrived
at a nunnery in Austria.

04:10.078 --> 04:12.244
Right after your mother died.

04:12.246 --> 04:15.580
That man found you
hiding in the library,

04:15.582 --> 04:17.748
and that man saved your life.

04:24.556 --> 04:26.589
- You.

04:26.591 --> 04:28.490
- You didn't recognize the cane?

04:30.694 --> 04:33.094
Untie me.

04:41.236 --> 04:44.070
- Tell me something
about yourself

04:44.072 --> 04:47.106
that no one else knows.

04:50.744 --> 04:52.744
- I'm a mystery to myself,

04:52.746 --> 04:55.213
Mr. Eichorst.

04:58.884 --> 05:02.051
- You enjoy being looked at.

05:02.053 --> 05:04.286
Your hair,

05:04.288 --> 05:06.588
your clothes.

05:06.590 --> 05:09.791
Your perfume.

05:09.793 --> 05:14.828
It's all very calculated.

05:14.830 --> 05:17.931
- I don't wear perfume.

05:17.933 --> 05:20.066
- Ah.

05:20.068 --> 05:24.403
(sniffing)
(short breathing)

05:26.240 --> 05:28.773
Yes, you're right.

05:28.775 --> 05:31.308
Shampoo.

05:33.145 --> 05:36.312
I'll tell you
something about myself

05:36.314 --> 05:38.614
that nobody knows.

05:38.616 --> 05:42.184
Your scent

05:42.186 --> 05:44.953
reminds me of a certain perfume

05:44.955 --> 05:47.322
that used to fill me
not only with desire

05:47.324 --> 05:49.590
but despair

05:49.592 --> 05:53.593
because I knew I could never
possess the woman who wore it.

05:53.595 --> 05:57.096
My life didn't include
that for some reason.

05:57.098 --> 06:00.632
I possessed other things:

06:00.634 --> 06:03.301
power,

06:03.303 --> 06:06.070
respect of other men.

06:10.676 --> 06:13.677
(chuckle)
Listen to me,

06:13.679 --> 06:16.212
the philosopher.

06:16.214 --> 06:19.215
Funny to long for desire

06:19.217 --> 06:21.416
when it never brought me
any happiness.

06:23.953 --> 06:27.287
- So you joined the Nazi party
because you couldn't get laid.

06:37.198 --> 06:40.299
- Someone like you
could never understand

06:40.301 --> 06:42.467
a thing like that.

07:02.755 --> 07:05.388
(bell ringing)
(throat clearing)

07:07.725 --> 07:09.725
- Yes?

07:09.727 --> 07:12.894
- Good day, Madam.
My name is Thomas Eichorst.

07:12.896 --> 07:15.096
I'm here to offer you
an exciting

07:15.098 --> 07:17.098
opportunity
to radioize your home,

07:17.100 --> 07:20.734
courtesy of the Triebig
Electrotech Company.

07:25.507 --> 07:28.007
- Oh, my. They're beautiful.

07:28.009 --> 07:30.009
- Yes, the mahogany cabinets

07:30.011 --> 07:34.713
make for an exciting
addition to any parlor.

07:34.715 --> 07:36.781
Now, with a simple twist

07:36.783 --> 07:41.118
of this knob, you'll have the
power of an orchestra conductor,

07:41.120 --> 07:43.720
(music plays)
calling forth the melodies

07:43.722 --> 07:46.456
of Beethoven and Wagner.

07:46.458 --> 07:49.025
- How much is it?

07:49.027 --> 07:51.460
- Triebig's easy
installment plan

07:51.462 --> 07:56.130
lets you acquire
this very model for just

07:56.132 --> 07:58.532
two marks a month.

07:58.534 --> 08:02.669
Just sign here
and the radio's yours.

08:10.144 --> 08:12.644
- Oh! I am buying you
a new radio.

08:14.314 --> 08:16.147
- They are laying people off
at the plant.

08:16.149 --> 08:18.382
I might not even have
a job next week.

08:18.384 --> 08:21.451
- It's just two marks
a month, sir,

08:21.453 --> 08:23.419
a very modest sum.

08:23.421 --> 08:25.354
- There is no such thing.

08:47.778 --> 08:50.010
(boisterous laughter)

08:52.014 --> 08:54.647
- Ah, Tommy! We're all waiting

08:54.649 --> 08:56.949
to declare a winner.

08:56.951 --> 09:01.486
So, how many radios
did you unload today, hmm?

09:03.423 --> 09:05.456
- Today? None.

09:05.458 --> 09:07.491
- Why do I even ask, hmm?

09:07.493 --> 09:11.694
- Tommy, your problem is you
have no fire in your belly.

09:11.696 --> 09:14.129
- Most people can't afford
a luxury item

09:14.131 --> 09:15.997
like a radio right now.

09:15.999 --> 09:18.099
- People aren't buying
the radio.

09:18.101 --> 09:21.702
They're buying you! You have
to project confidence, huh?

09:21.704 --> 09:24.438
Especially in times like these.

09:24.440 --> 09:27.674
If they sense your weakness,

09:27.676 --> 09:30.677
you are dead before
you even say a word, huh?

09:32.480 --> 09:36.514
Helga, may I have
the sales bonus, please?

09:36.516 --> 09:38.950
Thank you.
-<i> Bitte.</i>

09:40.553 --> 09:43.754
- To Karl Spurzem!
A salesman who leads

09:43.756 --> 09:46.056
with courage and strength!

09:46.058 --> 09:48.625
(clapping)

09:48.627 --> 09:52.227
To the bar!
Drinks on me.

09:52.229 --> 09:55.196
(men chatting)

09:59.268 --> 10:02.035
(sigh)
(phone ringing)

10:11.612 --> 10:15.580
- Oscar is a bully who will
never be more than a salesman.

10:15.582 --> 10:18.816
I think you're terrible
at selling radios, Tommy,

10:18.818 --> 10:21.185
because you're destined
for bigger things.

10:21.187 --> 10:24.655
- Thank you.

10:24.657 --> 10:26.757
Thank you for saying that.

10:26.759 --> 10:29.025
- I mean it.

10:29.027 --> 10:31.260
- Helga,

10:31.262 --> 10:35.697
I was wondering...
- Yes?

10:35.699 --> 10:38.499
- Would you have dinner
with me tonight?

10:40.202 --> 10:44.269
- I can't. I have plans.
- Oh.

10:44.271 --> 10:47.272
- But I could on Saturday.

10:47.274 --> 10:50.842
- Saturday it is!

11:07.693 --> 11:10.093
- Hey Aanya?

11:15.233 --> 11:17.967
Angel told me you might
be up here.

11:17.969 --> 11:20.636
- Yeah, I'm just doing
some sorting.

11:20.638 --> 11:23.939
- Is it OK if I come in?
- Sure.

11:30.546 --> 11:34.147
- (laughing): What?

11:34.149 --> 11:36.048
- Nothing, it's just,

11:36.050 --> 11:38.250
it's just funny having
somebody else up here.

11:38.252 --> 11:40.719
- Is it OK?

11:40.721 --> 11:43.054
- Yeah, you can help me
remember it after we leave.

11:55.834 --> 11:58.234
You're not coming with us.

12:00.705 --> 12:03.172
- It's not in me to run,

12:03.174 --> 12:05.340
you know?

12:10.012 --> 12:12.012
- It was a stupid idea anyways.

12:12.014 --> 12:15.148
I mean, how would that work?

12:49.483 --> 12:51.683
(men shouting)

13:05.231 --> 13:07.130
- This can't be the place.

13:07.132 --> 13:10.566
- Wow, this is the National
Guard Headquarters.

13:10.568 --> 13:12.801
- Now what?

13:34.924 --> 13:37.157
(distant thump)

13:39.694 --> 13:42.594
(distant door closing)

13:42.596 --> 13:45.630
- Aanya.

13:45.632 --> 13:47.898
(soft groaning)
Aanya.

13:51.336 --> 13:54.537
It's time to go.

13:54.539 --> 13:57.840
(clanking)
(distant sirens)

14:44.187 --> 14:48.088
- Would you mind? Please?
- Yeah, yeah. No problem.

14:48.090 --> 14:52.992
Um...
- Angel, you are with us. Come.

14:57.865 --> 14:59.865
- Alright. Smile, guys.

14:59.867 --> 15:02.567
One, two, three.
(shutter sound)

15:02.569 --> 15:05.670
Got it.

15:05.672 --> 15:08.539
- Now we can go.

15:08.541 --> 15:10.407
Are you ready, Angel?

15:10.409 --> 15:13.076
Is everything alright?
- Yeah, everything is alright.

15:13.078 --> 15:16.379
Ready to go.
(door unlocking)

15:16.381 --> 15:19.582
(door opening)
(foreign men's voices)

15:19.584 --> 15:21.951
(distant siren)

15:33.964 --> 15:36.464
(loud engine running)

15:41.737 --> 15:45.538
(squealing breaks)
- That cop lied.

15:45.540 --> 15:47.907
- He said she'd be here.

15:47.909 --> 15:51.710
There's only one Mayfield Hotel.
Come on. Let's look around.

16:02.956 --> 16:06.691
- Fet.
- What the hell?

16:17.170 --> 16:19.103
- She was here.

16:19.105 --> 16:22.506
- Shit.
- She could have been moved to another car.

16:22.508 --> 16:24.674
- If you're gonna switch cars,
you don't do it

16:24.676 --> 16:27.009
behind the National Guard
Headquarters.

16:34.651 --> 16:36.484
It's right there.

16:36.486 --> 16:38.953
Right in front
of our goddamn faces.

16:38.955 --> 16:42.156
- Look at the hotel...
The right side is all lit up

16:42.158 --> 16:44.124
but the left is dark
all the way to the top.

16:44.126 --> 16:47.594
- No lights at all.
Not even a television.

16:47.596 --> 16:50.530
The Mayfield was a famous hotel

16:50.532 --> 16:53.165
in the '30s and '40s,
then it became a flea-bag,

16:53.167 --> 16:56.668
transient kinda place until the
1980s when they remodeled it.

16:56.670 --> 16:59.604
At some point they must
have sealed that section off.

16:59.606 --> 17:01.939
Maybe they ran outta money.
I dunno.

17:01.941 --> 17:04.107
- Alright. How do we get inside?

17:05.810 --> 17:08.043
- Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

17:09.679 --> 17:12.413
- Not the answer
I would expect, but OK...

17:19.521 --> 17:21.387
- Are you going to untie me?

17:21.389 --> 17:24.189
- Why would I do that?
- I saved your life.

17:24.191 --> 17:26.124
- Yes.

17:26.126 --> 17:28.893
- So, now you need
to pay me back.

17:28.895 --> 17:31.695
- But if I let you go,
you'll take my book.

17:31.697 --> 17:34.898
- I'll purchase it.
Name your price.

17:34.900 --> 17:37.400
- Mother Superior told me

17:37.402 --> 17:41.203
it was cursed,
that I should burn it.

17:41.205 --> 17:43.538
But it's never
been cursed for me.

17:43.540 --> 17:45.506
It's been special.

17:45.508 --> 17:48.075
- It is special, Rudyard.
Very special.

17:48.077 --> 17:51.711
In the right hands,
it could save all of mankind.

17:51.713 --> 17:54.647
- It's in the right hands now.

17:54.649 --> 17:57.916
- Please, just tell me
what you want for it.

17:57.918 --> 18:00.551
- You're not the only person
who wants to buy it.

18:00.553 --> 18:03.554
Maybe someone else
will give me more.

18:03.556 --> 18:05.722
- Who else have you spoken to?

18:05.724 --> 18:07.990
Eldritch Palmer?

18:07.992 --> 18:09.758
Rudyard,

18:09.760 --> 18:11.926
you are making
a calamitous mistake!

18:11.928 --> 18:16.263
The fate of the world
is literally in your hands!

18:19.434 --> 18:22.435
- People always
underestimate me.

18:22.437 --> 18:25.070
They talk to me like you do now.

18:25.072 --> 18:29.340
Like I don't understand.
But I do understand.

18:31.177 --> 18:33.410
I have the book.

18:33.412 --> 18:36.546
All this time,
I've kept it safe.

18:36.548 --> 18:38.948
People would say,
"You couldn't even find

18:38.950 --> 18:41.617
Tahiti on a map, Rudyard."

18:41.619 --> 18:45.553
But I am going there now.

18:45.555 --> 18:48.055
And this is my silver ticket.

18:48.057 --> 18:50.424
- Rudyard, please!

18:50.426 --> 18:52.459
Don't.

18:52.461 --> 18:57.697
Rudyard! Rudyard!

19:07.708 --> 19:10.375
- (man): OK, you're clear to go.
Close the gate!

19:21.086 --> 19:23.086
How can I help you?

19:23.088 --> 19:27.990
- Augustin Elizalde. Gus.

19:27.992 --> 19:30.325
- You have some papers,
Mr. Elizalde?

19:32.295 --> 19:34.762
- I didn't know
I needed any papers.

19:34.764 --> 19:36.598
- You living under a rock?
'Cause everyone

19:36.624 --> 19:38.599
knows that this gate is
only open to government

19:38.601 --> 19:40.546
officials and citizens
with special credentials.

19:40.572 --> 19:41.635
- Can you do me a favor and

19:41.637 --> 19:45.472
check that list for my name?
- This isn't a nightclub. There is no list.

19:45.474 --> 19:48.308
- Please. Can't you just
let us go through?

19:48.310 --> 19:50.677
- Just relax, Ms. Gupta, OK?
I'll take care of it.

19:50.679 --> 19:53.613
(loud honking)

19:53.615 --> 19:57.750
- (muttering): What the hell?
Hey! Turn off your brights!

20:08.094 --> 20:11.862
- What do you want me to do?
- Nothing.

20:11.864 --> 20:14.431
Don't do nothing.

20:16.535 --> 20:21.703
- (guard, quietly): Clear?
OK.

20:24.274 --> 20:26.374
Drive through. Let's go.

20:26.376 --> 20:29.944
- Aanya! Wait!
- You know, you can still change your mind.

20:31.681 --> 20:35.049
- Just so you know?
We would've worked,

20:35.051 --> 20:39.152
just not right now.

20:39.154 --> 20:42.221
When it's all over,
I'm coming to get you.

20:42.223 --> 20:45.057
OK?

20:45.859 --> 20:48.459
OK?

20:48.461 --> 20:51.061
- Hey, c'mon! C'mon!

20:51.063 --> 20:53.129
Let's move!

20:58.902 --> 21:01.068
- See you guys later, alright?
- Thank you, Gus.

21:01.070 --> 21:04.271
- Yes. We are very grateful.
- Be safe, alright?

21:15.583 --> 21:17.816
- Hey, guys. Let 'em through!

21:28.895 --> 21:32.630
(low talking)

21:32.632 --> 21:37.100
- (Mr. Gupta): Thank you.
- (Angel): Goodbye.

21:39.871 --> 21:42.371
Thank you.

21:52.682 --> 21:54.881
- (guard): Alright, gate secure.

21:56.317 --> 21:58.684
- What is this?

21:58.686 --> 22:01.720
- This...

22:01.722 --> 22:04.189
this is the Silver Angel.

22:04.191 --> 22:06.858
- Nice to meet you.
- Now, are we gonna talk

22:06.860 --> 22:09.460
or we gonna drive?

22:15.167 --> 22:17.467
(screeching tires)

22:24.742 --> 22:27.442
(opera music playing)

22:49.665 --> 22:51.931
(jaunty music playing)
(lively chatter)

22:54.735 --> 22:58.036
- I don't feel as though
I'm playing the violin

22:58.038 --> 23:00.838
so much as it's playing me.

23:00.840 --> 23:03.540
- (chuckling):
What-- what do you mean?

23:03.542 --> 23:07.510
- Well, it had so many
owners before me.

23:07.512 --> 23:10.112
Each with their own
way of playing.

23:10.114 --> 23:12.180
Their own emotional life.

23:12.182 --> 23:14.448
It seemed to me as if the violin

23:14.450 --> 23:16.583
absorbed all that and

23:16.585 --> 23:20.853
created its own
personality and sound.

23:23.123 --> 23:26.757
Sounds kind of crazy, I guess.
- No! Not at all!

23:26.759 --> 23:30.293
But why haven't you pursued
a professional career?

23:30.295 --> 23:33.129
- That was my dream.

23:33.131 --> 23:35.131
I was hoping to go to Vienna;

23:35.133 --> 23:38.134
audition for the symphony.

23:38.136 --> 23:40.703
But then the crash came.

23:40.705 --> 23:43.439
Father lost his job.

23:43.441 --> 23:45.874
My family needs every penny
I can bring in.

23:45.876 --> 23:48.142
- But you must go to Vienna.

23:48.144 --> 23:50.844
If you don't, you'll regret it.

23:59.154 --> 24:02.054
- What about you, Tommy?

24:02.056 --> 24:03.789
Do you have any idea

24:03.791 --> 24:06.057
what you want to do
with your life?

24:06.059 --> 24:09.226
- Oh, I don't know.

24:09.228 --> 24:11.895
I envy you, Helga.

24:11.897 --> 24:14.230
You have a passion. A direction.

24:14.232 --> 24:17.600
At school, my friends...
they all knew

24:17.602 --> 24:20.235
they wanted to be
lawyers or engineers,

24:20.237 --> 24:22.770
or what have you.

24:22.772 --> 24:26.673
But me? Nothing's worked.

24:26.675 --> 24:29.909
I can't seem to find anything
at which I can excel.

24:29.911 --> 24:32.411
- Some people are late bloomers.

24:32.413 --> 24:35.647
- (man): Pardon me,
I need that table.

24:35.649 --> 24:39.517
Gentlemen, ladies, please

24:39.519 --> 24:41.485
may I have your attention!

24:41.487 --> 24:44.754
On my way here tonight, I passed
a bread line that stretched

24:44.756 --> 24:46.856
over a kilometer. People who

24:46.858 --> 24:50.659
have lost their jobs,
their pensions, their homes,

24:50.661 --> 24:52.694
their self-respect.

24:52.696 --> 24:56.197
Some say Germany's days
as a great nation are finished.

24:56.199 --> 24:59.166
But I refuse to believe that,

24:59.168 --> 25:01.668
my friends.
- Let's get out of here.

25:01.670 --> 25:04.037
- Just a minute.
- A Third Reich is rising

25:04.039 --> 25:05.718
like a phoenix from the ashes
of the Weimar Republic.

25:05.744 --> 25:06.806
A Reich in which
there are no more

25:06.808 --> 25:10.609
bread lines. A Reich
in which each and every German

25:10.611 --> 25:13.111
has a job, a sense of purpose

25:13.113 --> 25:16.013
and pride. A Reich that needs

25:16.015 --> 25:17.981
the blood and sweat
of true Germans.

25:17.983 --> 25:21.451
- (all):<i> Ja! Ja!</i>
- A Reich that needs you!

25:21.453 --> 25:23.152
And you! And you!

25:23.154 --> 25:26.622
Yes, you, my friend.

25:26.624 --> 25:28.624
Germany needs you!

25:28.626 --> 25:31.159
Who here has lost his pension?

25:31.161 --> 25:33.227
Who here has lost his home?

25:33.229 --> 25:36.262
Who here thinks they've lost
the ability to hope?

25:38.232 --> 25:41.499
- What is the matter?
That was a great speech.

25:41.501 --> 25:43.834
Hitler wants to unite
all the German people.

25:43.836 --> 25:46.169
- Except the Jews.

25:46.171 --> 25:48.404
You do know what
the Nazis think?

25:48.406 --> 25:50.873
- Of course. They're finally
saying it out loud:

25:50.875 --> 25:53.508
the Jewish bankers crashed
the stock market.

25:53.510 --> 25:55.576
They're the ones who saddled
Germany with debts

25:55.578 --> 25:57.544
and ruined our economy.

25:57.546 --> 26:01.447
They're parasites and leeches.

26:03.050 --> 26:05.483
What?

26:05.485 --> 26:08.018
- You're so blind.

26:08.020 --> 26:10.687
You can't see what's right
in front of your face.

26:10.689 --> 26:12.755
- What, Helga?

26:12.757 --> 26:15.724
- I'm a Jew.

26:15.726 --> 26:19.927
Is that how you see me?

26:19.929 --> 26:22.596
Am I a parasite?

26:22.598 --> 26:26.833
Or a leech?
- Oh, I didn't mean you...

26:26.835 --> 26:31.670
or your family. Hitler was
talking about the foreign Jews.

26:31.672 --> 26:33.872
From Poland and from Russia.

26:33.874 --> 26:38.743
Hitler has no problem with the
German Jews. And neither do I.

26:40.513 --> 26:45.182
- I was wrong about you. You're
not destined for better things.

26:45.184 --> 26:47.784
You're right where you belong.

26:47.786 --> 26:50.119
At the bottom of the blackboard.

26:50.121 --> 26:53.021
- No, Helga.

26:56.459 --> 26:58.692
(whispering): Helga.

27:00.929 --> 27:03.095
(door opening)

27:09.570 --> 27:12.370
I brought you a snack.

27:16.709 --> 27:18.809
- What? You're seasoning me now?

27:18.811 --> 27:21.111
No, thanks!

27:21.113 --> 27:23.212
(whispering): No, thanks.

27:25.382 --> 27:28.416
(small cry)
- Did you hear me ask,

27:28.418 --> 27:31.452
"Would you care
for some pineapple?"

27:31.454 --> 27:34.354
No, you did not.

27:36.424 --> 27:40.926
This isn't a dinner party where
someone passes you the peas

27:40.928 --> 27:44.562
and you say,
"No, thanks. I'm fine."

27:44.564 --> 27:47.464
(loud breathing)

27:47.466 --> 27:51.200
Tell me you will
eat the pineapple.

27:52.970 --> 27:55.170
- Yes, I'll eat it.

27:55.172 --> 27:57.238
- No! Say,

27:57.240 --> 28:00.741
"Yes, I will eat the pineapple."

28:03.278 --> 28:05.344
- Yes,

28:05.346 --> 28:07.312
I will eat the pineapple.

28:10.350 --> 28:13.384
(coughing)

28:24.830 --> 28:28.064
- Good girl.

28:31.135 --> 28:33.101
And yes,

28:33.103 --> 28:36.737
as a seasoning,
pineapple is exquisite.

28:53.855 --> 28:56.722
(whimpering)

29:07.033 --> 29:09.633
(distant siren)

29:14.038 --> 29:18.240
(scraping)
(heavy breathing)

29:40.730 --> 29:43.263
(distant voices)

30:28.643 --> 30:30.876
(grunt)

30:33.080 --> 30:36.381
(eerie music)

30:56.001 --> 30:58.401
Take off your pants.

31:01.172 --> 31:03.305
- (scoffing): What?

31:03.307 --> 31:05.740
- Remove your pants, Dutch.

31:08.177 --> 31:11.711
Now!

31:24.625 --> 31:27.692
- Well, I know you lost
your dick 70 years ago,

31:27.694 --> 31:29.760
so what are you gonna do?

31:29.762 --> 31:33.163
- You'll be surprised.

31:33.165 --> 31:36.267
It is a night

31:36.269 --> 31:39.270
for trying new things.

31:39.272 --> 31:41.272
Your mouth.

31:41.274 --> 31:43.474
Give it to me.

31:48.046 --> 31:51.347
(short breaths)

32:00.123 --> 32:02.723
<i> Gut...</i>

32:02.725 --> 32:05.491
<i> gut.</i>

32:07.294 --> 32:09.294
<i> Gut.</i>

32:09.296 --> 32:11.729
<i> Gut.</i>

32:25.911 --> 32:28.411
(whispering): Spread your legs.

32:31.516 --> 32:33.749
Bend over.

32:36.520 --> 32:40.321
(croaking)

32:40.323 --> 32:43.523
(low squealing)

32:46.327 --> 32:48.260
(spraying sound)

32:48.262 --> 32:51.830
(yelling and shrieking)

33:10.683 --> 33:12.716
- Ah! Ah!

33:12.718 --> 33:15.085
Shit!

33:18.523 --> 33:21.056
(crying out)

33:21.058 --> 33:23.558
Ah, God!

33:23.560 --> 33:26.460
(whimpering)

33:51.186 --> 33:54.487
Come on, come on,
please! Come on!

33:59.260 --> 34:02.828
(whispering): What is this?

34:18.778 --> 34:21.845
- Now, the Mayfield sits right
above two dead-end lines

34:21.847 --> 34:24.948
from Grand Central,
tracks 61 and 63.

34:24.950 --> 34:26.883
Now, back in the day,

34:26.885 --> 34:29.518
they used those lines
as a private subway entrance

34:29.520 --> 34:32.888
for President Roosevelt
whenever he came to New York.

34:32.890 --> 34:36.725
So then no one would see him
in his wheelchair. Here we go.

34:36.727 --> 34:39.961
- Careful. Looks like a<i> strigoi</i> passage.
- Exactly.

34:39.963 --> 34:42.863
Not good. Let's go!

34:45.100 --> 34:48.501
- Agh!

34:53.274 --> 34:56.375
Ah...

35:01.815 --> 35:05.116
(low growling)

35:22.935 --> 35:25.167
- We got it!

35:26.937 --> 35:29.404
(bang)

35:34.677 --> 35:38.445
(heavy breathing)

35:38.447 --> 35:42.715
- (distant): Where are you,
<i> Fraulein</i> Velders?

35:44.652 --> 35:47.252
Please stop running.

35:50.523 --> 35:53.390
There is no way to go.

36:17.515 --> 36:21.016
Your shampoo,<i> Fraulein,</i>
and your blood...

36:21.018 --> 36:25.253
I'm almost there.

36:52.414 --> 36:56.315
- No! No!
No! No!

36:58.218 --> 37:02.553
No, please! Please!

37:02.555 --> 37:06.088
(footsteps)

37:06.090 --> 37:08.323
(growling)

37:13.162 --> 37:15.395
Get away from me!

37:19.767 --> 37:22.033
(muffled): No!

37:22.035 --> 37:24.001
- Did you hear that?

37:24.003 --> 37:26.036
- (muffled): No!
Get away from me!

37:26.038 --> 37:28.405
- Come on!

37:28.407 --> 37:32.542
- Thank you for an engaging
chase,<i> Fraulein.</i>

37:32.544 --> 37:35.444
- No, stay away from me!

37:35.446 --> 37:37.746
Oh, please.

37:37.748 --> 37:41.116
- You know, most days,
eating is simply a duty.

37:41.118 --> 37:43.551
But this...

37:43.553 --> 37:47.187
I have not looked forward
to a meal like you in...

37:47.189 --> 37:49.689
I can't remember how long.

37:49.691 --> 37:52.091
- I hope you choke on me!

37:52.093 --> 37:54.826
Aah!
(grunting)

37:57.096 --> 37:59.229
- Time for us to be going.

37:59.231 --> 38:01.631
- No! No!

38:03.635 --> 38:06.402
- What? No!

38:06.404 --> 38:09.738
- Screw you, you arsehole!

38:09.740 --> 38:12.107
(thumping)
Ah!

38:12.109 --> 38:14.976
- Dutch!
(grunting)

38:14.978 --> 38:17.111
(screaming)
Dutch!

38:17.113 --> 38:21.147
(clinking)

38:21.149 --> 38:23.649
I'm coming for you!

38:34.628 --> 38:36.861
You all might wanna get back.

38:59.151 --> 39:01.351
- (distant): No! No!

39:01.353 --> 39:04.954
Help! Help!

39:04.956 --> 39:08.957
No! No! No!

39:08.959 --> 39:11.125
(screaming)

39:11.127 --> 39:14.895
Somebody! Help!

39:17.532 --> 39:19.265
(curses in German)

39:22.436 --> 39:25.603
- Dutch!

39:28.107 --> 39:30.373
(crying)

39:30.375 --> 39:32.875
You alright? Hmm?

39:38.948 --> 39:41.114
- Gah!

39:47.455 --> 39:50.622
(crying)

40:04.403 --> 40:06.569
(sizzling)

40:06.571 --> 40:09.405
(loud yell)

40:25.823 --> 40:27.689
- Ah,<i> Untersturmfuhrer.</i>

40:27.691 --> 40:31.159
Thank you so much for coming.
- How can I help?

40:42.738 --> 40:45.872
- This Jew claims to know you.

40:45.874 --> 40:49.408
- I'm so sorry to bring
you into this,

40:49.410 --> 40:51.576
but they are threatening
to deport me,

40:51.578 --> 40:55.512
and my whole family.
Thomas, please tell--

40:55.514 --> 40:57.614
(gasp)
- You do not address an officer

40:57.616 --> 41:00.183
of the SS by his first name.

41:00.185 --> 41:02.585
Do you understand?

41:02.587 --> 41:04.820
- Yes.

41:07.925 --> 41:11.459
- Is it true?

41:11.461 --> 41:14.361
That you have a relationship?

41:17.733 --> 41:20.900
- We worked in the same office

41:20.902 --> 41:23.202
for seven months.

41:29.409 --> 41:31.609
Then she was accused
of stealing.

41:31.611 --> 41:35.478
- What?
- It was never proven, but...

41:35.480 --> 41:37.146
the money was gone, nonetheless.

41:37.148 --> 41:39.548
- None of this is true!
- That was the extent

41:39.550 --> 41:41.716
of my relationship with her.

41:45.121 --> 41:49.156
- Thank you for clarifying
this matter,<i> Untersturmfuhrer.</i>

41:50.893 --> 41:53.693
(crying)

42:02.469 --> 42:04.702
(indistinct chatter)

42:07.239 --> 42:09.405
-<i> Heil.</i>

42:12.610 --> 42:15.010
-<i> Sieg heil.</i>

42:15.012 --> 42:17.645
-<i> Guten tag, mein herr.</i>

42:21.617 --> 42:24.016
-<i> Heil Hitler,</i>
<i> Herr Untersturmfuhrer!</i>

42:25.919 --> 42:29.253
It's good to see you again, sir.

42:37.596 --> 42:40.964
(birds cawing)

42:49.306 --> 42:51.539
(creaking)

42:56.144 --> 42:59.545
(violin music)

43:26.173 --> 43:28.405
(gulp)

43:30.142 --> 43:32.909
(sirens)
(honking)

43:39.016 --> 43:41.249
(soft crying)

44:37.206 --> 44:40.240
(distant sirens)

44:48.249 --> 44:50.449
- Wait right there.

44:54.154 --> 44:57.555
State your business.
- Mr. Rudyard Fonescu

44:57.557 --> 44:59.757
to see Alonso Creem.

44:59.759 --> 45:03.827
- Is he expecting you?
- Cardinal MacNamara sent me.

45:07.165 --> 45:09.165
(static click)
- There's a man here.

45:09.167 --> 45:11.767
Wants to see you.
Says the Cardinal sent him.

45:11.769 --> 45:14.202
- (man): He's good.

45:14.204 --> 45:17.304
- Move over.

45:18.240 --> 45:20.773
(distant siren)

45:20.775 --> 45:23.307
OK, let's go.

45:25.878 --> 45:28.311
- (guard): Right.
- (second guard): Clear.

45:42.126 --> 45:46.828
(throat clearing)
- My name is Rudyard Fonescu.

45:48.865 --> 45:51.699
The Cardinal said
you could help me.

45:51.701 --> 45:54.034
- Cardinal's dead.

45:54.036 --> 45:55.969
- This was before he died.

45:55.971 --> 45:58.571
In fact, I think
it's why he died.

45:58.573 --> 46:02.074
I have something.

46:02.076 --> 46:03.975
Something people
would pay a lot

46:03.977 --> 46:07.277
of money for.
- The<i> Lumen.</i>

46:09.114 --> 46:12.415
- How do you know?
- Let me see it.

46:12.417 --> 46:15.117
- I need money.
I need safe passage--

46:15.119 --> 46:17.853
- I need to see the book.

46:55.025 --> 46:58.426
I think we can do business.

47:04.032 --> 47:07.099
(theme music)
