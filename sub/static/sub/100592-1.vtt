[whimsical orchestral music]

00:35.897 --> 00:39.073
[alarm clock sounding]

00:48.772 --> 00:51.361
Good morning, beautiful.

00:51.361 --> 00:53.329
Shouldn't I be the one
saying that to you?

00:53.329 --> 00:54.123
Mm hmm.

00:55.779 --> 00:59.024
Careful, or I will
fall back asleep,

00:59.024 --> 01:01.061
and guess who will have
to get the kids ready?

01:01.061 --> 01:03.304
Oh, well, we can't
have that, can we?

01:03.304 --> 01:04.754
Mm mm.

01:04.754 --> 01:08.689
Although, we could just
take a lazy day today.

01:08.689 --> 01:10.725
I have 30 pages to write.

01:10.725 --> 01:13.176
You and your
self-imposed deadlines.

01:13.176 --> 01:15.282
I have a photo portrait
session later this afternoon,

01:15.282 --> 01:17.146
but you don't hear me
complaining, do you?

01:17.146 --> 01:18.768
30 pages takes much longer

01:18.768 --> 01:21.357
than you clicking
away on your camera.

01:21.357 --> 01:22.185
Ouch.

01:22.185 --> 01:23.117
[Megan giggles]

01:23.117 --> 01:24.084
[children giggling]

01:24.084 --> 01:26.120
Mm, uh oh, here they come.

01:27.466 --> 01:29.019
Boy Dino is here.

01:29.019 --> 01:31.263
Let go of Mom or face justice.

01:31.263 --> 01:34.473
Oh, no no, no need for justice,
Boy Dino, I'll cooperate.

01:34.473 --> 01:36.165
Oh, come here, my superhero.

01:36.165 --> 01:38.477
Oh, you're too big
for mommy kisses now?

01:38.477 --> 01:39.685
Good morning, Isabelle.

01:39.685 --> 01:41.480
You're late for my wizard show.

01:41.480 --> 01:43.206
My deepest apologies.

01:43.206 --> 01:46.209
Why don't you show me while I
start cooking you breakfast?

01:46.209 --> 01:47.210
Cinnamon rolls!

01:47.210 --> 01:48.453
Ooh, I want some.

01:48.453 --> 01:51.111
If we can have the
kind in the can, sure.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.905
If not, I'll make them appear.

01:52.905 --> 01:53.734
Yes!

01:53.734 --> 01:55.253
[children giggling]

01:55.253 --> 01:59.326
Ow, oh, Dylan, Boy Dino, can
you pick up your minions?

02:01.328 --> 02:03.123
What do you want me
to make for lunches?

02:03.123 --> 02:04.779
I'll do it.

02:04.779 --> 02:05.849
I'll come in after my shower.

02:05.849 --> 02:08.404
All right.

02:08.404 --> 02:11.026
[mellow music]

02:23.384 --> 02:27.630
All right, what do you
want for lunches today?

02:27.630 --> 02:30.184
Oh, a game of hide and go seek.

02:31.634 --> 02:35.948
Okay, watch out, Boy Dino,
and Isabelle the Wizard.

02:35.948 --> 02:38.261
Mom is up for the challenge.

02:39.193 --> 02:40.056
Gotcha!

02:48.754 --> 02:53.552
Wow, you kiddos are actually
being pretty quiet this time.

02:54.795 --> 02:57.694
[mysterious music]

02:59.593 --> 03:02.009
Hey, Thomas, do you
know where the kids are?

03:02.009 --> 03:05.254
[mysterious music]

03:05.254 --> 03:08.602
Isabelle, come on,
you're gonna be late.

03:10.120 --> 03:13.641
[mysterious music]

03:13.641 --> 03:14.918
Dylan!

03:14.918 --> 03:17.335
[mysterious music]

03:17.335 --> 03:19.095
Where's my superhero?

03:20.959 --> 03:23.962
Okay, guys, this game
isn't fun anymore!

03:23.962 --> 03:27.379
How about you all
come out already?

03:27.379 --> 03:30.279
[mysterious music]

03:35.042 --> 03:35.870
Thomas!

03:37.044 --> 03:39.943
[mysterious music]

03:56.719 --> 04:00.585
[machines humming and beeping]

04:08.627 --> 04:11.251
[mysterious music]

04:11.251 --> 04:16.185
Megan, sweetie, can you hear me?

04:17.947 --> 04:20.950
If you can hear me,
squeeze my hand.

04:22.053 --> 04:22.986
Where am I?

04:22.986 --> 04:25.437
Megan, calm down, calm down.

04:26.990 --> 04:31.132
I need a doctor in room
610, patient is awake.

04:31.132 --> 04:32.030
Look at me.

04:33.549 --> 04:34.550
Thank you.

04:37.069 --> 04:39.658
Hi, Megan, I'm, I'm Dr. Taylor.

04:41.246 --> 04:45.077
Okay, I got a little
light here for you.

04:45.077 --> 04:48.115
Oh [groaning].

04:48.115 --> 04:49.392
I know, I know, it's bright.

04:49.392 --> 04:50.911
Just bear with me.

04:53.776 --> 04:54.708
Can you follow my pen?

04:54.708 --> 04:56.123
Mm hmm.

04:58.712 --> 05:02.232
Good, do you know where you are?

05:02.232 --> 05:03.786
The hospital.

05:03.786 --> 05:05.477
That's right,
listen, I know things

05:05.477 --> 05:07.928
are rather confusing
for you right now.

05:07.928 --> 05:11.103
We're gonna call your
parents, all right?

05:11.103 --> 05:13.278
I'm gonna run some tests
while we wait for them.

05:13.278 --> 05:15.867
[Megan grunts]

05:26.429 --> 05:28.189
Hi, it's a miracle.

05:29.259 --> 05:32.124
Oh, sweetheart, you're awake.

05:32.124 --> 05:33.333
What happened?

05:33.333 --> 05:35.645
Careful, just take
it easy, Megan.

05:35.645 --> 05:37.302
The doctor said
you'd be a bit stiff.

05:37.302 --> 05:40.650
You just need to get your
muscles used to movement.

05:40.650 --> 05:42.203
Where's Thomas?

05:42.203 --> 05:44.274
What?

05:44.274 --> 05:46.207
Where's Thomas?

05:46.207 --> 05:47.416
Who's Thomas?

05:48.382 --> 05:49.487
My husband.

05:51.109 --> 05:52.421
Husband?

05:52.421 --> 05:55.355
Megan, you're not married.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.943
Um, my, my kids, where are they?

05:57.943 --> 05:59.462
Kids?

05:59.462 --> 06:02.914
Yes, Isabelle and
Dylan, where are they?

06:04.191 --> 06:06.538
Megan, listen to us.

06:06.538 --> 06:10.162
You are not married, and
you don't have any children.

06:10.162 --> 06:13.234
No, no, you're
wrong, you're wrong.

06:15.409 --> 06:18.032
Megan, let's try to
breath and calm down.

06:18.032 --> 06:21.829
No, Thomas, Isabelle and
Dylan, where are they?

06:21.829 --> 06:24.038
What happened to my family?

06:24.038 --> 06:25.557
Megan, listen to us.

06:25.557 --> 06:30.390
Whatever other family you think
you have, they don't exist.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.633
But I was just with them.

06:35.464 --> 06:38.984
Why would she think she's
married or has children?

06:38.984 --> 06:42.160
The accident wouldn't make her
think these things, would it?

06:42.160 --> 06:44.265
The brain is a delicate thing.

06:44.265 --> 06:46.233
Okay, we don't
understand it all.

06:46.233 --> 06:48.822
It's most likely a side
effect of the coma.

06:48.822 --> 06:50.513
You can think of it as a dream.

06:50.513 --> 06:52.791
She thinks this really happened.

06:52.791 --> 06:55.725
I expected her to be happy.

06:55.725 --> 06:57.934
Instead she's miserable.

06:57.934 --> 07:01.110
Remember, she just woke
up today, all right?

07:01.110 --> 07:04.493
It's, it's gonna take
some time to adjust.

07:04.493 --> 07:06.391
Good news is she
remembers both of you,

07:06.391 --> 07:08.324
so we know it's not amnesia.

07:08.324 --> 07:09.601
Could she get worse at all?

07:09.601 --> 07:11.741
I wanna confirm with
the test results,

07:11.741 --> 07:15.227
but from what I've
seen, this is recovery.

07:15.227 --> 07:17.506
Honestly, from a
medical standpoint,

07:17.506 --> 07:20.301
this is the best
possible outcome.

07:20.301 --> 07:21.337
Thank you, Dr. Taylor.

07:21.337 --> 07:22.580
Yeah, thanks.

07:26.307 --> 07:29.587
The crash happened
two months ago.

07:29.587 --> 07:31.485
You were driving by yourself,

07:31.485 --> 07:34.177
and I was on the phone with you.

07:38.250 --> 07:39.804
This weather is insane.

07:39.804 --> 07:41.357
Don't speed.

07:41.357 --> 07:42.772
Who would speed in
this weather, Mom?

07:42.772 --> 07:45.292
I think your father will
love his birthday gift.

07:45.292 --> 07:46.604
Yeah, well, he better.

07:46.604 --> 07:48.985
I had to drive two
hours to pick it up.

07:48.985 --> 07:50.539
Have you ever heard of delivery?

07:50.539 --> 07:51.919
It can be from both of us.

07:51.919 --> 07:53.162
No, it's okay, I
already got him--

07:53.162 --> 07:54.025
[tires screeching]
[Megan gasping]

07:54.025 --> 07:56.821
[car crashing]

07:56.821 --> 07:58.236
I heard it all.

07:59.651 --> 08:02.585
We didn't think that you'd
make it the first two days.

08:02.585 --> 08:05.415
And after that came the
news that you might live,

08:05.415 --> 08:06.727
but not wake up.

08:07.935 --> 08:10.386
I know that you are confused.

08:11.732 --> 08:15.667
I know that everything
is a lot to take in.

08:15.667 --> 08:18.394
Just don't forget
how much we love you.

08:18.394 --> 08:21.708
I've prayed for this every
moment over the last months.

08:21.708 --> 08:24.331
[mellow music]

08:26.644 --> 08:27.507
I know.

08:28.646 --> 08:31.234
[mellow music]

08:32.201 --> 08:33.513
I love you, Mom.

08:36.446 --> 08:40.208
[whimsical orchestral music]

08:41.244 --> 08:42.900
Hey, honey.

08:42.900 --> 08:47.492
[whimsical orchestral music]

08:47.492 --> 08:48.424
Come on now.

08:48.424 --> 08:49.218
All right, you guys take care.

08:49.218 --> 08:50.322
Thank you so much.

08:50.322 --> 08:52.117
Thank you.

08:52.117 --> 08:55.845
[whimsical orchestral music]

09:01.057 --> 09:01.989
We stopped by your apartment,

09:01.989 --> 09:03.715
and we picked up some things.

09:03.715 --> 09:04.889
Is my apartment--

09:04.889 --> 09:07.063
It's fine, we've
kept your rent going,

09:07.063 --> 09:09.894
and we've also been
picking up your mail.

09:09.894 --> 09:11.758
Okay, well, we
could just go there.

09:11.758 --> 09:13.242
Well, the doctor
said you shouldn't

09:13.242 --> 09:15.313
be alone for a few
days, besides, we--

09:15.313 --> 09:16.590
We want you home.

09:16.590 --> 09:18.281
Yeah.

09:18.281 --> 09:20.180
So, what do you want
to do for dinner?

09:20.180 --> 09:22.458
How about my famous Alfredo?

09:22.458 --> 09:23.286
Deb.

09:23.286 --> 09:24.115
What?

09:24.115 --> 09:25.495
Ease up.

09:25.495 --> 09:27.428
Alfredo sounds great.

09:32.917 --> 09:35.160
So, do you remember this?

09:36.472 --> 09:38.336
Of course [chuckles].

09:38.336 --> 09:39.820
Doesn't hurt to ask.

09:39.820 --> 09:41.201
I will get dinner going then.

09:41.201 --> 09:42.996
All right, okay.

09:42.996 --> 09:44.514
Why don't you rest
a little, Megan?

09:44.514 --> 09:45.964
I'm fine.

09:45.964 --> 09:47.207
The doctor said--

09:47.207 --> 09:49.899
Okay, do you have my
phone or my computer?

09:49.899 --> 09:51.970
Oh, promise me that
you're gonna take it easy.

09:51.970 --> 09:53.558
Yeah, of course.

09:53.558 --> 09:56.285
[Howard groans]

09:56.285 --> 10:00.013
[whimsical orchestral music]

10:02.187 --> 10:04.189
Okay, Thomas Claybourne.

10:05.674 --> 10:09.436
[whimsical orchestral music]

10:21.344 --> 10:23.553
No, where are you?

10:23.553 --> 10:27.419
[whimsical orchestral music]

10:27.419 --> 10:29.249
[Megan sighs]

10:29.249 --> 10:30.630
Things should start
getting back to normal

10:30.630 --> 10:32.217
now that she's home.

10:32.217 --> 10:36.808
Normal, do you realize
she isn't the same person?

10:36.808 --> 10:38.707
Maybe not now, but she will be.

10:38.707 --> 10:40.674
She just needs time,

10:40.674 --> 10:42.849
and the doctor
suggested a therapist.

10:42.849 --> 10:44.540
Psychiatrist.

10:44.540 --> 10:46.024
Call it what you want,

10:46.024 --> 10:48.855
but it's somebody that can help
her, you know, emotionally.

10:48.855 --> 10:52.237
Our daughter thinks she
has a husband and children.

10:52.237 --> 10:54.792
You think a shrink's
gonna fix that?

10:54.792 --> 10:57.173
I don't know, but we need to do

10:57.173 --> 11:00.176
anything and everything
we can to help her.

11:00.176 --> 11:01.074
All right.

11:02.903 --> 11:07.080
[whimsical orchestral music]

11:07.080 --> 11:08.978
[doorbell ringing]

11:08.978 --> 11:10.117
Mom?

11:10.117 --> 11:12.016
Can you get that?

11:12.016 --> 11:12.844
Yep.

11:16.330 --> 11:17.400
Hey, hi [giggles].

11:17.400 --> 11:19.782
Hi, oh, oh, am I hurting you?

11:19.782 --> 11:21.128
No, I'm, I'm fine.

11:21.128 --> 11:22.509
Come on in.

11:22.509 --> 11:24.476
Oh, you had us all so scared.

11:24.476 --> 11:25.305
I know.

11:26.824 --> 11:29.205
So, how's it been?

11:29.205 --> 11:30.034
What?

11:30.931 --> 11:32.036
Being back?

11:34.555 --> 11:37.904
From your tone, I know
my parents warned you.

11:37.904 --> 11:38.732
Fine.

11:39.871 --> 11:41.114
Did they tell you I'm crazy?

11:41.114 --> 11:42.494
No, not really.

11:43.979 --> 11:47.085
Great.

11:47.085 --> 11:49.778
So, you totally think
you were married?

11:49.778 --> 11:52.435
Yeah, but it's more than that.

11:54.472 --> 11:55.749
It felt so real.

11:57.751 --> 12:01.824
Wow, I'm hearing you, but
it still sounds weird.

12:05.621 --> 12:08.313
Can you take me somewhere?

12:08.313 --> 12:10.799
[whimsical orchestral music]

12:10.799 --> 12:11.731
This is it.

12:13.871 --> 12:15.735
Hey, easy.

12:15.735 --> 12:19.497
[whimsical orchestral music]

12:22.534 --> 12:24.088
It's completely empty.

12:24.088 --> 12:26.711
Sure, it's still being built.

12:27.643 --> 12:28.955
He's not here.

12:30.232 --> 12:31.992
His name is Thomas.

12:31.992 --> 12:34.029
He's four years to
the day older than me.

12:34.029 --> 12:36.134
He, he loves photography,

12:36.134 --> 12:39.241
and, and he's built up this
amazing business with it,

12:39.241 --> 12:43.176
and he loves me, and our, our
children, Isabelle, and Dylan,

12:43.176 --> 12:48.181
and they get along, and they
have the most creative minds.

12:48.940 --> 12:50.217
It's not just a dream.

12:51.701 --> 12:53.393
You don't miss a dream.

12:53.393 --> 12:58.363
You don't feel heartbroken
from a dream [crying].

12:58.985 --> 13:00.296
I'm sorry.

13:01.159 --> 13:04.818
[whimsical orchestral music]

13:07.510 --> 13:11.031
[Debra clears throat]

13:11.031 --> 13:13.309
We set up an
appointment tomorrow

13:13.309 --> 13:16.692
with the therapist Dr.
Taylor recommended.

13:16.692 --> 13:18.418
I don't need a therapist.

13:18.418 --> 13:19.937
Just go once.

13:19.937 --> 13:24.804
See if they can find a reason
for what you thought was real.

13:24.804 --> 13:29.394
Plus, I think it would help
Dr. Taylor's peace of mind.

13:33.019 --> 13:38.024
Well, the power of the mind
can make anything seem real.

13:38.507 --> 13:39.749
Okay.

13:39.749 --> 13:41.890
It can be confusing.

13:41.890 --> 13:44.616
You might think, what
does it all mean?

13:44.616 --> 13:48.241
Is your subconscious
telling you something?

13:48.241 --> 13:49.725
Sure.

13:49.725 --> 13:52.555
Do you think your subconscious
is telling you something?

13:52.555 --> 13:55.041
I think it's telling
me that I'm an author,

13:55.041 --> 13:56.766
ah, which I'm not,

13:56.766 --> 13:58.838
but I would like to be one day,

13:58.838 --> 14:02.151
and that I have a
husband and two children.

14:02.151 --> 14:03.981
Hmm, confusing, huh?

14:07.225 --> 14:09.193
I'm sorry, I'm, I'm tired.

14:09.193 --> 14:11.333
You know, head injury and all.

14:11.333 --> 14:12.817
Yeah, of course, of course.

14:12.817 --> 14:16.959
Well, actually, rest will
help quite a bit and routine.

14:16.959 --> 14:18.167
Routine?

14:18.167 --> 14:19.410
Yeah, get back to
your usual activities,

14:19.410 --> 14:21.412
exercise, work, hobbies.

14:22.792 --> 14:27.038
Well, my work let me go, because
I was in a coma too long.

14:27.038 --> 14:29.040
What type of work?

14:29.040 --> 14:31.215
Executive Assistant.

14:31.215 --> 14:32.837
Hmm, tough break.

14:34.080 --> 14:37.014
Well, get a new job, it'll help.

14:37.014 --> 14:38.463
It'll keep you focused
on something else

14:38.463 --> 14:40.465
while giving you perspective
you might not get

14:40.465 --> 14:44.193
if you keep trying to figure
out what happened to you.

14:44.193 --> 14:45.022
Thanks.

14:46.092 --> 14:49.889
[whimsical orchestral music]

14:55.895 --> 14:56.965
Hey, sweetie.

14:56.965 --> 14:59.243
Hey, Mom.

14:59.243 --> 15:01.038
Let's get to work.

15:01.038 --> 15:03.281
So, did you dust this table?

15:03.281 --> 15:04.869
No.

15:04.869 --> 15:06.698
You would think not
being here for two months

15:06.698 --> 15:08.493
would mean it'd be cleaner.

15:08.493 --> 15:10.357
Mm hmm.

15:10.357 --> 15:13.395
So, what have you thought
about going back to work?

15:13.395 --> 15:16.777
I'm working on it,
not my old job though.

15:16.777 --> 15:18.952
Well, good, I can
ask some friends.

15:18.952 --> 15:21.851
See if anyone knows of an
Executive Assistant job.

15:21.851 --> 15:24.820
Yeah, I'm not
going back to that.

15:24.820 --> 15:26.477
Why not?

15:26.477 --> 15:28.617
Well, I don't know.

15:28.617 --> 15:33.622
I wanna do more than just help
someone else in their career.

15:34.450 --> 15:36.556
All right, and instead?

15:38.247 --> 15:39.939
I don't know.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.147
I thought about it.

15:41.147 --> 15:44.840
It's just nothing
else seems appealing.

15:44.840 --> 15:46.911
You need some way
to pay the bills.

15:46.911 --> 15:48.533
I, I know, of course.

15:48.533 --> 15:53.124
Look, I will find something
temporary to start,

15:53.124 --> 15:54.470
other than writing.

15:54.470 --> 15:55.920
That's a hobby.

15:57.749 --> 16:00.545
Nothing else sounds interesting.

16:02.789 --> 16:05.033
Well, we've had a few
calls for an assistant,

16:05.033 --> 16:06.966
promising things actually.

16:06.966 --> 16:10.624
Ah, I want to expand my
experiences beyond that.

16:10.624 --> 16:14.042
All right, ah, any
particular industry?

16:14.042 --> 16:15.112
Not really.

16:16.354 --> 16:18.908
Okay, we have a
need for a nanny,

16:18.908 --> 16:23.051
billing for a dental
practice, receptionist,

16:23.051 --> 16:28.056
ah, assembly line at a packing
company, cleaning assistant.

16:28.677 --> 16:30.127
Any of those?

16:30.127 --> 16:31.991
I guess it doesn't really
matter for right now.

16:31.991 --> 16:36.029
Okay, well, looking
at your experience,

16:36.029 --> 16:37.582
let's stay in the same arena.

16:37.582 --> 16:39.412
The receptionist
job is a short-term,

16:39.412 --> 16:43.174
but the owner did hint
at something permanent,

16:43.174 --> 16:45.590
if that's something you want.

16:45.590 --> 16:47.247
Oh, okay, all right.

16:51.355 --> 16:52.183
Yeah, there it is.

16:52.183 --> 16:53.874
Here is the address.

16:53.874 --> 16:55.531
Be there tomorrow
morning at nine.

16:55.531 --> 16:56.670
Thanks.

16:56.670 --> 16:58.051
You're welcome.

[whimsical orchestral music]

17:39.886 --> 17:43.545
Oh, hi, hey, you must
be the temp, Thomas.

17:44.753 --> 17:45.650
It's you.

17:46.996 --> 17:49.240
Ah, yes, Thomas, you are?

Um, Megan Murph, Megan
Murphy, Meg, together.

18:04.945 --> 18:05.774
Megan Murphy.

18:05.774 --> 18:07.293
Mm hmm.

18:07.293 --> 18:07.845
Well, Megan Murphy, let me
show you the phone, okay?

18:07.845 --> 18:08.501
Okay.

18:08.501 --> 18:09.502
All right.

18:12.056 --> 18:15.024
So, not ringing
off the hook yet,

18:15.024 --> 18:16.888
but business is
starting to pick up.

18:16.888 --> 18:19.857
I just opened about
a month ago, so.

18:19.857 --> 18:21.686
[whimsical orchestral music]

18:21.686 --> 18:23.240
Megan?

18:23.240 --> 18:24.103
Yeah?

18:24.103 --> 18:24.931
Phone.

18:24.931 --> 18:26.139
Right, right.

18:27.830 --> 18:29.142
Okay, so mostly, I just need you

18:29.142 --> 18:31.144
to schedule appointments
for customers,

18:31.144 --> 18:32.939
ah, which I'm sorry to say,

18:32.939 --> 18:35.044
are handwritten
in a planner here,

18:35.044 --> 18:37.046
but when people call in,

18:38.496 --> 18:41.120
I'm sorry, are you,
are you all right?

18:41.120 --> 18:45.676
Yeah, yeah, um, I'm sorry,
you just look so familiar.

18:49.680 --> 18:53.718
[clears throat]
Do, do you know me?

18:53.718 --> 18:56.411
I'm sorry, no, I don't think so.

18:56.411 --> 18:58.344
[telephone ringing]

18:58.344 --> 18:59.241
Oh, oh, okay, here we go.

18:59.241 --> 19:01.830
Ah.

19:01.830 --> 19:04.591
Berry Patch Photography,
can I help you?

19:04.591 --> 19:06.904
Yes, yes, okay, for
a group that size,

19:06.904 --> 19:09.286
I recommend about
an hour session.

19:09.286 --> 19:11.736
It takes just a little while
to get everyone positioned.

19:11.736 --> 19:13.428
And you could bring in a
couple changes of clothes,

19:13.428 --> 19:15.326
but we just need to
keep an eye on the time,

19:15.326 --> 19:17.535
so everyone has enough.

19:17.535 --> 19:19.330
Um, yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:19.330 --> 19:20.573
[camera clicks]

19:20.573 --> 19:24.404
Okay, yeah, just call
when you wanna schedule,

19:24.404 --> 19:26.234
and we'll get you
on the books, okay.

19:26.234 --> 19:28.028
Thanks, you too, bye.

19:30.203 --> 19:31.549
I'm just, I'm just
taking a photo

19:31.549 --> 19:34.000
of the, the phone, and
the planner, you know?

19:34.000 --> 19:36.796
So I don't, don't
forget where they are.

19:36.796 --> 19:37.624
Okay.

19:39.005 --> 19:41.249
Ah, sorry, I should've,
I should've got that.

19:41.249 --> 19:42.802
Nah, you get the next one.

19:42.802 --> 19:46.046
So, Berry Patch Photography.

19:46.046 --> 19:48.773
Yeah, yeah, it's kind of
a cutesy name, I know,

19:48.773 --> 19:50.775
but I figure it brings
in kids and families,

19:50.775 --> 19:52.432
and it's a start.

19:52.432 --> 19:54.434
Not Claybourne Photography,

19:54.434 --> 19:56.298
or something with
your name in it?

19:56.298 --> 19:57.541
I, I don't know.

19:57.541 --> 20:00.129
One day maybe I'll
ah, wait, I'm sorry.

20:00.129 --> 20:02.822
How'd you know my
name was Claybourne?

20:02.822 --> 20:06.653
Ah, because, because,
it's right here.

20:06.653 --> 20:09.484
It's on your card, Thomas
Claybourne [chuckles].

20:09.484 --> 20:12.211
Right, right, ah, so
like I was saying,

20:12.211 --> 20:13.695
yeah, someday I'll
change the name,

20:13.695 --> 20:16.007
but I just, I don't know, I
don't feel like I'm there yet.

20:16.007 --> 20:17.526
I figured, better to go
for marketing right now,

20:17.526 --> 20:20.391
than to feed my ego, I think.

20:20.391 --> 20:22.911
You'll definitely get there.

20:24.464 --> 20:29.262
Okay, well, I have an
appointment in about 10 minutes,

20:29.262 --> 20:33.232
so you need anything,
ah, photo policy, prices,

20:34.543 --> 20:36.096
payments, cancellation
policies, anything like that,

20:36.096 --> 20:38.789
they are ah, right in here.

20:38.789 --> 20:40.100
Got it.

20:40.100 --> 20:41.826
So, I'll be back
there if you need me.

20:41.826 --> 20:42.655
Okay.

20:42.655 --> 20:43.483
Okay.

20:43.483 --> 20:44.450
Thank you.

Welcome, do you
have an appointment?

21:00.431 --> 21:02.537
Yes, ah, last name Wiley.

21:02.537 --> 21:06.368
Okay, gotcha, okay,
just give me one minute.

21:07.404 --> 21:08.267
Oh, oh, oh.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.268
Oh [chuckles].

21:09.268 --> 21:10.096
Sorry.

21:10.096 --> 21:11.270
That's okay, yeah.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.719
Hey, you guys all ready?

21:12.719 --> 21:13.651
Yeah.

21:13.651 --> 21:14.376
Oh, great, what's your name?

21:14.376 --> 21:15.239
Jack.

21:15.239 --> 21:16.067
Jack, and you?

21:16.067 --> 21:17.517
Isabelle.

21:17.517 --> 21:20.313
Isabelle, you know, that
is my favorite girl's name.

21:20.313 --> 21:21.694
All right, come on back.

21:21.694 --> 21:24.283
Have you set up right over here.

21:24.283 --> 21:28.010
[whimsical orchestral music]

21:33.326 --> 21:35.811
No way it's the same guy.

21:35.811 --> 21:37.434
I think I know my husband.

21:37.434 --> 21:38.849
Your dreamed up husband.

21:38.849 --> 21:40.333
You know what?

21:40.333 --> 21:43.129
Same name, same appearance,
same mannerisms, it's him.

21:43.129 --> 21:44.268
It's blurry.

21:45.752 --> 21:47.098
Well, he was moving.

21:47.098 --> 21:50.101
You're serious?

21:50.101 --> 21:51.689
You don't believe me?

21:51.689 --> 21:53.242
You obviously want
it to be true.

21:53.242 --> 21:55.969
What if your mind is just
somehow making it seem real.

21:55.969 --> 21:57.557
So, not only did I have

21:57.557 --> 22:00.457
a delusional dream
in my coma, Dr. Eve,

22:00.457 --> 22:02.390
but now I'm
hallucinating at work?

22:02.390 --> 22:03.839
Everyone has a doppelganger.

22:03.839 --> 22:05.358
Not with the same name.

22:05.358 --> 22:07.326
He's a photographer
like my Thomas.

22:07.326 --> 22:10.605
He loves the name Isabelle,
which is our daughters name.

22:10.605 --> 22:15.506
I even made an entire list of
things that I know about him.

22:16.818 --> 22:18.302
His favorite color's purple?

22:18.302 --> 22:19.752
Yeah.

22:19.752 --> 22:22.341
Oh, hot chocolate over
coffee, movies over books,

22:22.341 --> 22:23.894
Asian food, but not too spicy,

22:23.894 --> 22:24.998
hates hamburgers
and strawberries.

22:24.998 --> 22:26.517
Who hates strawberries?

22:26.517 --> 22:28.139
That's not the point.

22:28.139 --> 22:29.934
Only likes football,
no other sports.

22:29.934 --> 22:32.661
Likes music, but also
likes it quiet too.

22:32.661 --> 22:34.249
Parent's names are
Patrick and Mary.

22:34.249 --> 22:35.457
I didn't meet her.

22:35.457 --> 22:37.356
She died before we met.

22:37.356 --> 22:39.219
Favorite photography spots.

22:39.219 --> 22:40.324
See?

22:40.324 --> 22:42.499
This is just in your dream.

22:42.499 --> 22:46.848
Look, you, why couldn't you
find his photography studio?

22:46.848 --> 22:49.471
You searched for him
and came up empty.

22:49.471 --> 22:51.266
Well, just because
I didn't find it,

22:51.266 --> 22:52.750
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

22:52.750 --> 22:53.993
Yeah, but why?

22:53.993 --> 22:55.926
You know everything
else about him.

22:55.926 --> 22:57.583
Maybe it was before we met.

22:57.583 --> 22:59.585
You met in a dream.

22:59.585 --> 23:01.552
Where did you meet
in your dream?

23:01.552 --> 23:03.658
We were standing in
line at a bookstore.

23:03.658 --> 23:05.522
He asked me what I was buying.

23:05.522 --> 23:06.868
We hit it off from there.

23:06.868 --> 23:08.352
And it's not the same because?

23:08.352 --> 23:10.285
It's not an exact science.

23:10.285 --> 23:13.012
It's not a science at all.

23:13.012 --> 23:15.048
Do you hear how
bizarre this sounds?

23:15.048 --> 23:16.464
We're about to spiral
down some weird,

23:16.464 --> 23:18.362
time matrix
continuum or whatever

23:18.362 --> 23:20.191
just to try to explain this.

23:20.191 --> 23:23.781
Okay, I can't explain
this, I admit that,

23:25.265 --> 23:29.200
but that doesn't mean that
it isn't real or real yet.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.650
Look, think this
through a moment.

23:30.650 --> 23:32.134
Actually, forget what I think.

23:32.134 --> 23:33.412
What does he think?

23:33.412 --> 23:34.758
[Megan grunts]

23:34.758 --> 23:36.967
Exactly, you haven't told him,

23:36.967 --> 23:37.899
and you can't tell him,

23:37.899 --> 23:40.280
or he'd think you're crazy too.

23:40.280 --> 23:41.730
Wait, too?

23:41.730 --> 23:44.871
Crazy, he'd think you're crazy.

23:44.871 --> 23:46.873
I think you're creative.

23:48.841 --> 23:50.808
Okay, you know what?

23:50.808 --> 23:51.982
I'm gonna prove it to you,

23:51.982 --> 23:53.362
and not for your sake,

23:53.362 --> 23:55.813
but no matter what
you or my mom,

23:55.813 --> 23:59.610
or Doctor what's his face
think, Thomas is real,

23:59.610 --> 24:03.511
and I love him too much
to let him go, so there.

24:10.897 --> 24:14.453
Hey, that's a really nice
photo of your parents.

24:14.453 --> 24:15.315
Oh, ah.

24:16.834 --> 24:21.356
Ah, assuming that those two
people are your parents.

24:23.462 --> 24:24.980
Sure are.

24:24.980 --> 24:28.156
Ah, anyway, um, I think
that there are messages,

24:28.156 --> 24:29.398
but I can't get them,

24:29.398 --> 24:30.607
because I don't
know the password.

24:30.607 --> 24:33.057
Yeah, yeah, okay, you
can access those online.

24:33.057 --> 24:34.403
You open up the browser,

24:34.403 --> 24:36.854
it'll default to
the voicemail inbox.

24:36.854 --> 24:38.511
Just make sure you don't trust

24:38.511 --> 24:40.858
the auto-transcripts
from those messages.

24:40.858 --> 24:42.998
Yeah, I know, I once
got a voicemail,

24:42.998 --> 24:45.518
and I thought it was
about a giant platypus,

24:45.518 --> 24:50.523
like this is, [sighs], not
important right now, thank you.

24:52.456 --> 24:55.217
[sighs] Oh, boy.

24:56.149 --> 24:58.600
[bell ringing]

24:58.600 --> 25:00.015
Hi, can I help you?

25:00.015 --> 25:01.638
Oh, I'm here for Tommy.

25:01.638 --> 25:02.673
Let me go get him for you.

25:02.673 --> 25:03.743
Are you the temp?

25:03.743 --> 25:05.504
Yeah, ah, Megan Murphy.

25:05.504 --> 25:08.886
Natalie Gray, I'm
Tommy's girlfriend.

25:08.886 --> 25:10.267
Are you sure?

25:10.267 --> 25:11.164
Um, what?

25:13.097 --> 25:16.273
I mean, you are
Thomas's girlfriend.

25:19.138 --> 25:23.073
Yes, um, are you part
of an exchange program?

25:24.143 --> 25:24.971
Um, no.

25:26.179 --> 25:29.389
Well, he forgot his
cellphone at lunch.

25:29.389 --> 25:33.462
Okay, that's great.

25:35.982 --> 25:40.400
[whimsical orchestral music]

25:40.400 --> 25:41.470
Thanks.

25:41.470 --> 25:43.576
Yeah, see you tomorrow.

25:43.576 --> 25:44.543
Megan] Same time?

25:44.543 --> 25:45.785
Ah, yeah.

25:45.785 --> 25:47.131
Goodnight, Thomas.

25:47.131 --> 25:48.063
Yeah.

25:48.063 --> 25:50.583
[whimsical orchestral music]

25:50.583 --> 25:52.481
It's temporary.

25:52.481 --> 25:54.967
[whimsical orchestral music]

25:54.967 --> 25:56.071
Can you take this?

25:56.071 --> 25:56.900
Yeah.

25:56.900 --> 25:57.832
Thank you.

25:57.832 --> 25:58.936
Thanks for having me over.

25:58.936 --> 25:59.868
Of course.

25:59.868 --> 26:02.284
So, Mom says you have a new job.

26:02.284 --> 26:03.769
How is it?

26:03.769 --> 26:07.600
It's fine, I'm just answering
phones, making appointments.

26:07.600 --> 26:08.463
Yeah.

26:08.463 --> 26:09.568
Nothing too hard.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.466
Do you like the place?

26:11.466 --> 26:15.677
Yeah, it's a cute, little
photography studio.

26:15.677 --> 26:16.540
[Howard chuckles]

26:16.540 --> 26:18.266
And how are the people?

26:18.266 --> 26:20.164
The customers are fine.

26:20.164 --> 26:22.960
How about the photographers
and the others?

26:22.960 --> 26:25.031
Ah, it's just the boss really.

26:25.031 --> 26:26.550
Oh.

26:26.550 --> 26:28.276
Is he not that nice?

26:28.276 --> 26:30.554
You know, you don't
have to put up with it.

26:30.554 --> 26:32.383
No, he's, he's fine.

26:33.971 --> 26:35.628
He's sweet actually.

26:36.905 --> 26:40.840
Sort of everything you
could ask for in a boss.

26:43.602 --> 26:47.571
Eh, anyway, there's ah, a
friend of his that comes by,

26:47.571 --> 26:50.091
it's, it's kind of awkward.

26:50.091 --> 26:51.540
Well, it's just temporary.

26:51.540 --> 26:53.232
You can just quit any time.

26:53.232 --> 26:54.509
It's fine.

26:54.509 --> 26:57.236
Well, they're lucky
to have you, Megan.

26:57.236 --> 26:59.825
You ah, you just do your best.

26:59.825 --> 27:03.242
Your work will stand
out [chuckles].

27:03.242 --> 27:04.968
Thanks, Dad.

27:04.968 --> 27:07.695
[whimsical orchestral music]

27:07.695 --> 27:10.145
[bell rings]

27:12.976 --> 27:14.287
Hi, um.

27:14.287 --> 27:15.219
Good morning.

27:15.219 --> 27:16.462
Here.

27:16.462 --> 27:20.121
Hmm, you didn't have
to do that, thank you.

27:20.984 --> 27:23.469
Mm, wow, that's hot chocolate.

27:24.643 --> 27:28.647
Yeah, just seemed
like the day for it.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.821
It's my favorite
kind, extra creamer.

27:30.821 --> 27:32.512
How'd you know?

27:32.512 --> 27:34.583
Um, I'm glad that you like it.

27:34.583 --> 27:36.102
Listen, I was thinking about

27:36.102 --> 27:37.759
setting up the
appointments online.

27:37.759 --> 27:39.830
It might be easier
and more reliable.

27:39.830 --> 27:41.936
You know, I kept actually
meaning to do that,

27:41.936 --> 27:43.213
but getting this place going,

27:43.213 --> 27:44.663
it just kept moving off my list.

27:44.663 --> 27:46.285
Yeah, well, maybe
I can find a way

27:46.285 --> 27:49.046
for the clients to book
a session themselves.

27:49.046 --> 27:50.910
Do you know how to do that?

27:50.910 --> 27:52.981
I can look into it.

27:52.981 --> 27:54.742
Please let me know
what you find.

27:54.742 --> 27:55.777
Okay.

27:55.777 --> 27:56.778
Thank you.

27:58.090 --> 28:01.749
[whimsical orchestral music]

28:03.267 --> 28:05.442
Hey, just a big smile, buddy.

28:05.442 --> 28:07.202
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:07.202 --> 28:08.790
Come on, just smile.

28:08.790 --> 28:10.827
I'll take for ice
cream, I promise.

28:10.827 --> 28:14.831
How about a stuffed
animal to play with, yeah?

28:15.728 --> 28:16.660
Yeah, okay.

28:19.732 --> 28:21.665
I, I don't really
want that in the shot.

28:21.665 --> 28:23.253
Maybe just to calm him down.

28:23.253 --> 28:26.670
[stuffed animal squeaks]

28:27.878 --> 28:30.639
Oh no [sighs].

28:31.848 --> 28:36.542
No, this will not do
[exhales heavily].

28:39.062 --> 28:42.134
I haven't seen that in years.

28:42.134 --> 28:44.239
Oh, ah yeah, there it is.

28:49.279 --> 28:52.040
Okay, hmm, give
me this and this.

29:02.430 --> 29:04.259
This is a magic crate.

29:05.605 --> 29:07.711
Okay, goodbye, old bunny.

29:11.957 --> 29:15.029
Do you wanna help me
with the magic trick?

29:15.029 --> 29:16.513
[boy whimpers]

29:16.513 --> 29:19.067
I need you to say the
magic word, which is poof.

29:19.067 --> 29:20.862
On the count of three.

29:20.862 --> 29:22.726
One, two, three, poof.

29:29.491 --> 29:32.563
[gasps] There it is!

29:34.738 --> 29:37.810
Do you like airplanes, yeah?

29:37.810 --> 29:42.435
[whimsical orchestral music]

29:42.435 --> 29:47.440
Do you wanna hold that and
take care of it for me, okay.

29:48.856 --> 29:52.514
[Megan imitates plane engine]
[whimsical orchestral music]

30:15.744 --> 30:17.332
I got the green curry for you.

30:17.332 --> 30:18.851
Yes, Baan Thai?

30:18.851 --> 30:23.062
Yep, so my department is
opening up a new field of study.

30:23.062 --> 30:24.132
Oh yeah?

30:24.132 --> 30:26.307
Linguistic
anthropology, finally.

30:26.307 --> 30:28.585
I have been telling
them for three years now

30:28.585 --> 30:29.931
that it should be a focus.

30:29.931 --> 30:32.037
Good, and they're gonna
let you head it up?

30:32.037 --> 30:35.040
Mm, working on that, you know?

30:35.040 --> 30:36.455
Good.

30:36.455 --> 30:39.838
Mm, so, how's the
new temp working out?

30:40.908 --> 30:42.944
Good, yeah, yeah, good.

30:44.635 --> 30:45.705
A little bit worried at first.

30:45.705 --> 30:47.224
She seemed ah, odd.

30:49.986 --> 30:51.297
But she was better today.

30:51.297 --> 30:53.782
I'm glad, yeah, I
got the weird vibe

30:53.782 --> 30:55.267
from her too the other day.

30:55.267 --> 30:59.236
Yeah, well, she's actually
helping now, so, hmm.

30:59.236 --> 31:00.030
Good.

31:02.584 --> 31:05.001
Mm, they got this just right.

31:05.864 --> 31:07.727
Yeah, let me try it.

31:09.074 --> 31:10.523
Good?

31:10.523 --> 31:13.319
Oh, wow, that's hot
[inhales deeply].

31:13.319 --> 31:14.873
I just ordered medium heat.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.046
Medium there is like nuclear

31:16.046 --> 31:18.877
compared to
everywhere else, whew.

31:19.774 --> 31:21.327
Mm, it's perfect.

31:23.709 --> 31:27.437
[whimsical orchestral music]

31:28.852 --> 31:30.681
Hey, so some of the clients
in the appointment book

31:30.681 --> 31:32.683
had an outdoor
location selected.

31:32.683 --> 31:34.064
Have you transferred that over?

31:34.064 --> 31:37.757
Yeah, except some of the
appointments seem to be in code.

31:37.757 --> 31:39.414
What's P-C-F-H?

31:39.414 --> 31:42.348
Oh, that's this little
farmhouse I found.

31:42.348 --> 31:43.902
[whimsical orchestral music]

31:43.902 --> 31:46.870
Oh, it's the Pine
Creek Farmhouse.

31:48.113 --> 31:50.046
Right, yeah, how'd you know?

31:50.046 --> 31:53.463
Ah, I've been there, sort of.

31:53.463 --> 31:56.811
Ah, I'm guessing it's one
of your favorite spots?

31:56.811 --> 32:00.332
Yeah, ah, when is
that appointment?

32:00.332 --> 32:01.781
Ah, it's Friday.

32:03.542 --> 32:04.474
You know, it might
be good to get

32:04.474 --> 32:06.200
an extra set of hands that day.

32:06.200 --> 32:07.718
Wanna get out of the studio?

32:07.718 --> 32:08.788
Sure, yeah.

32:10.169 --> 32:11.136
All right.

32:11.136 --> 32:12.206
Okay.

32:12.206 --> 32:14.622
[whimsical orchestral music]

32:14.622 --> 32:17.245
The hardest thing is not having
that common ground anymore.

32:17.245 --> 32:18.798
You know, it's just one-sided.

32:18.798 --> 32:19.903
He's not psychic.

32:19.903 --> 32:21.042
Ugh, I know.

32:22.216 --> 32:25.667
Although, it'd be really
helpful if he was.

32:25.667 --> 32:27.221
I just miss it.

32:27.221 --> 32:28.912
You know, the
closeness that we had.

32:28.912 --> 32:30.155
Which he can't
really have with you

32:30.155 --> 32:31.639
when he has a girlfriend.

32:31.639 --> 32:34.538
Ugh, and I wanna hate
her, but she seems normal.

32:34.538 --> 32:35.954
Oh, you're so much
better than me.

32:35.954 --> 32:38.404
I'd have a voodoo doll
or something by now.

32:38.404 --> 32:39.612
Eh, it's not her fault

32:39.612 --> 32:40.959
she fell in love
with the wrong guy.

32:40.959 --> 32:42.374
I love your logic.

32:42.374 --> 32:43.789
You know what I mean.

32:43.789 --> 32:46.067
Thomas, he's my
other half, you know?

32:46.067 --> 32:49.243
Mm, been there, my other
half turned out rotten.

32:49.243 --> 32:50.796
Yeah, I know.

32:50.796 --> 32:52.763
Oh, it's okay, bud.

32:52.763 --> 32:55.283
It's just gonna take a
little getting used to.

32:55.283 --> 32:58.631
Poor guy, he got his paw
run over by his owners bike.

32:58.631 --> 33:00.116
Ouch.

33:00.116 --> 33:03.740
You ever think that maybe
Thomas is too good to be true?

33:03.740 --> 33:04.983
You had a dream.

33:04.983 --> 33:07.778
What if on the inside,
he's not the same guy.

33:07.778 --> 33:11.023
Yeah, but it seems really
coincidental for him not to be.

33:11.023 --> 33:12.852
You wanna dive
into coincidences?

33:12.852 --> 33:13.922
Good point.

33:15.303 --> 33:16.235
You know, you said about Thomas

33:16.235 --> 33:18.927
being the same on the inside.

33:18.927 --> 33:20.999
What about the outside?

33:20.999 --> 33:23.001
You're asking me
if I believe you?

33:23.001 --> 33:23.829
Maybe.

33:26.038 --> 33:29.352
Yeah, I do, although,
I wanna meet him,

33:29.352 --> 33:31.285
and see what all
the fuss is about.

33:31.285 --> 33:32.734
Thank you.

33:32.734 --> 33:34.184
I know you, Megan.

33:34.184 --> 33:38.154
You believe it and what you're
saying, it has to be true.

33:38.154 --> 33:40.777
I wish I could count on the
same trust from my parents.

33:40.777 --> 33:43.297
The parent, child dynamic
clouds their view.

33:43.297 --> 33:44.505
Mm hmm.

33:44.505 --> 33:45.713
When I was going
through my divorce,

33:45.713 --> 33:48.129
my mom asked me what
happened over and over,

33:48.129 --> 33:50.821
just in different ways.

33:50.821 --> 33:52.306
I mean, when you found
out about me and Kyle,

33:52.306 --> 33:54.825
you were just supportive.

33:54.825 --> 33:58.415
No doubts, no questions,
just there for me.

33:59.347 --> 34:00.590
You remember that?

34:00.590 --> 34:03.765
Why does everyone
think my memory's gone?

34:03.765 --> 34:05.146
Has Thomas seen
that side of you?

34:05.146 --> 34:06.354
What side?

34:06.354 --> 34:08.943
Just you, who you are?

34:08.943 --> 34:12.119
So he can see for himself

had to go through.

44:39.090 --> 44:40.091
Thank you.

44:41.299 --> 44:44.716
Um, I'm gonna set up for
your first appointment.

44:44.716 --> 44:45.579
Okay.

44:53.691 --> 44:54.692
Tommy, oh.

44:59.731 --> 45:00.939
How's your dad?

45:01.837 --> 45:02.838
About how you'd expect.

45:02.838 --> 45:04.184
I am so sorry.

45:06.358 --> 45:11.329
You know, in many cultures,
death is a celebration of life.

45:11.329 --> 45:15.264
It can be a way to acknowledge
good things to come,

45:15.264 --> 45:17.749
especially for those
who have passed.

45:17.749 --> 45:21.995
For example, in Ghana,
they have fantasy coffins,

45:21.995 --> 45:24.031
shaped and decorated in anything

45:24.031 --> 45:28.656
from a symbol of a favorite
hobby or profession

45:28.656 --> 45:31.901
to celebrate what
that person loved.

45:31.901 --> 45:35.353
It's honoring what
they did in this life,

45:36.595 --> 45:39.495
and letting them
continue on after.

45:41.048 --> 45:45.535
What do you think your mom's
coffin would be like there?

45:45.535 --> 45:47.468
I really don't know.

45:47.468 --> 45:49.712
Hi, have we had a chance
to look at the menu?

45:49.712 --> 45:51.956
I'm, yeah, I'm actually not
really hungry right now,

45:51.956 --> 45:55.718
so I think I need to get
back to the studio, thanks.

45:55.718 --> 45:56.892
Are you all right?

45:56.892 --> 45:59.998
Yeah, yeah, I'm
just ah, I'm tired.

46:01.759 --> 46:04.002
You know, I'm still
processing everything, so.

46:04.002 --> 46:06.453
Okay, get some rest, Tommy.

46:08.351 --> 46:10.768
Eh, could you not
call me that anymore?

46:10.768 --> 46:13.115
I thought you liked it?

46:13.115 --> 46:14.564
It's just that my
mom was the only one

46:14.564 --> 46:16.049
who would call me Tommy,

46:16.049 --> 46:18.258
and I just would kind of
like to keep it that way.

46:18.258 --> 46:19.604
Oh, of course.

46:21.709 --> 46:22.710
Okay, bye.

46:29.821 --> 46:31.478
Thanks.

46:31.478 --> 46:33.583
Sorry, for cutting
the day short today.

46:33.583 --> 46:35.620
Oh, you got your
sessions in, that's fine.

46:35.620 --> 46:39.072
Yeah, I, I'm not
super focused today,

46:39.072 --> 46:41.557
but I'm gonna finish retouching
those photos tomorrow.

46:41.557 --> 46:43.145
I'll see you tomorrow.

46:43.145 --> 46:44.491
Thanks, Megan.

46:45.630 --> 46:48.115
Hey, if you don't
have any plans today,

46:48.115 --> 46:51.498
do you wanna come
to the aquarium?

46:51.498 --> 46:53.327
The aquarium?

46:53.327 --> 46:54.881
Yeah, it's just
something different,

46:54.881 --> 46:57.331
and it has one of my
favorites spots to write.

46:57.331 --> 46:59.333
Thanks, I, I ah, I, I.

47:02.578 --> 47:03.751
You know what?

47:04.649 --> 47:06.651
Yeah, that sounds great.

47:07.686 --> 47:11.380
Okay, come on [chuckles].

47:11.380 --> 47:15.108
[whimsical orchestral music]

47:18.663 --> 47:19.491
Wow.

47:22.425 --> 47:24.462
Not bad.

47:24.462 --> 47:28.190
Yeah, I like to come
here whenever I can.

47:28.190 --> 47:30.917
I hate to point out
the obvious though.

47:30.917 --> 47:31.849
What?

47:31.849 --> 47:33.091
It's dark, it's noisy.

47:33.091 --> 47:34.334
How do you get any
writing done here?

47:34.334 --> 47:36.508
You just have to know
the right times to come.

47:36.508 --> 47:41.513
Between school groups, toddler
nap time, you can find quiet.

47:42.687 --> 47:45.034
I come here for more
than just writing.

47:45.034 --> 47:50.039
I like to brainstorm, think
things through and people-watch.

47:51.489 --> 47:55.355
Maybe find some interesting
characters for your books?

47:55.355 --> 47:56.666
Maybe.

47:56.666 --> 47:57.875
[Thomas chuckles]

47:57.875 --> 47:59.221
And I got in an
accident recently,

47:59.221 --> 48:02.327
so it has been a bit
of an adjustment.

48:05.261 --> 48:06.884
You're, you're all
right now though?

48:06.884 --> 48:07.815
Oh, yeah.

48:10.991 --> 48:13.718
Interesting just how much is
out of our control, isn't it?

48:13.718 --> 48:17.929
Yeah, it's maddening
really, but what can you do?

48:19.724 --> 48:22.554
Still trying to figure that out.

48:24.418 --> 48:27.042
Are your parents, they
ah, they still around?

48:27.042 --> 48:30.114
Yep, I have dinner with
them every Sunday night,

48:30.114 --> 48:32.254
whether I like it or not.

48:32.254 --> 48:34.428
Consider yourself lucky.

48:35.705 --> 48:37.949
Right, um, I'm sorry.

48:37.949 --> 48:38.812
Nah.

48:42.885 --> 48:47.614
I had a dear friend, he lost
his mom suddenly like you.

48:49.547 --> 48:50.928
It was before I met him,

48:50.928 --> 48:52.860
and it always bothered him

48:52.860 --> 48:55.829
how things could
change overnight,

48:55.829 --> 49:00.765
but I think I finally understand
that he just missed her.

49:01.628 --> 49:04.010
My heart aches for both of you.

49:04.010 --> 49:05.943
What happened to him?

49:06.978 --> 49:10.016
Um, we sorted drifted
apart I guess.

49:12.742 --> 49:15.159
Tell me about your parents.

49:15.159 --> 49:17.333
Well, my dad means well,

49:18.507 --> 49:21.820
and he likes to fix what
he can fix [chuckles].

49:21.820 --> 49:26.377
Ah, my mom, it's fun to see
how she balances him out.

49:26.377 --> 49:27.723
She's very supportive,

49:27.723 --> 49:30.174
but she does like to
nudge in the direction

49:30.174 --> 49:32.693
that she thinks is best.

49:32.693 --> 49:34.661
What about your parents?

49:34.661 --> 49:39.666
My mom, pure love, that's the
best way I can describe her.

49:41.875 --> 49:43.981
No matter what happened,

49:43.981 --> 49:47.053
I never doubted how
much she loved me.

49:47.053 --> 49:48.226
She knew what was important,

49:48.226 --> 49:51.298
and what she did
everyday showed that.

49:53.335 --> 49:55.751
I wish I could've met her.

49:55.751 --> 49:58.133
My dad is lost without her.

49:59.548 --> 50:02.275
I'm bringing him freezer
meals so he doesn't starve.

50:02.275 --> 50:03.966
Just give him time.

50:03.966 --> 50:05.519
He'll find his way.

50:06.486 --> 50:08.971
I wish I had your confidence.

50:08.971 --> 50:10.524
Well, he has you.

50:11.422 --> 50:12.595
He knows that.

50:14.149 --> 50:17.945
You seem so sure about
everything all the time.

50:17.945 --> 50:22.778
It feels like ah, I don't know,
it feels like you know me.

50:23.986 --> 50:26.299
I know what you mean.

50:26.299 --> 50:29.302
[telephone ringing]

50:38.621 --> 50:40.278
So what have you been
doing for your writing?

50:40.278 --> 50:42.211
Ugh, not enough.

50:42.211 --> 50:43.799
Obviously, if you wanna
be good at something,

50:43.799 --> 50:45.870
you have to dedicate time to
it every single day, right?

50:45.870 --> 50:47.803
Yeah, but you have to
have a good idea first.

50:47.803 --> 50:49.046
I'm sure you have a good idea.

50:49.046 --> 50:50.495
What's a good plot?

50:50.495 --> 50:51.841
I'm kicking some things around.

50:51.841 --> 50:53.291
Yeah, like what?

50:54.499 --> 50:56.191
Okay, one.

50:56.191 --> 50:57.157
Mm hmm?

50:57.157 --> 50:59.401
Is spooky mystery about a woman

50:59.401 --> 51:01.782
who learns to be invisible.

51:01.782 --> 51:03.405
Really?

51:03.405 --> 51:05.510
Okay, I didn't say
they were good ideas.

51:05.510 --> 51:06.580
[Thomas laughs]

51:06.580 --> 51:08.720
Second one is a medieval romance

51:08.720 --> 51:09.963
about a political assassination

51:09.963 --> 51:11.792
that brings two people together.

51:11.792 --> 51:12.724
Okay, I mean, you just went from

51:12.724 --> 51:14.657
sci-fi to historical romance.

51:14.657 --> 51:17.833
And wait until you hear my
idea for a Christmas book.

51:17.833 --> 51:20.491
[Thomas laughs]

51:24.046 --> 51:26.359
So, the follow-up
tests are okay?

51:26.359 --> 51:29.431
Absolutely, I'm glad to
see you're doing so well.

51:29.431 --> 51:30.328
Thanks for coming in.

51:30.328 --> 51:31.329
Thank you.

51:33.090 --> 51:34.160
You seem pretty
happy for someone

51:34.160 --> 51:36.438
who's been poked and prodded.

51:36.438 --> 51:39.303
I'm just glad to have all
the medical stuff behind me.

51:39.303 --> 51:42.202
Hmm, I think it's
more than that.

51:43.307 --> 51:44.584
What do you mean?

51:44.584 --> 51:46.448
I don't know.

51:46.448 --> 51:50.072
Remember when you had that
crush on Peter Melina?

51:50.072 --> 51:51.522
In high school?

51:51.522 --> 51:52.902
Like that, but,

51:55.388 --> 51:56.975
are you in love?

51:56.975 --> 51:58.253
[Megan scoffs]

51:58.253 --> 52:00.565
I was never really
in love with Peter.

52:00.565 --> 52:02.740
But you are in love now?

52:04.845 --> 52:05.674
Who is he?

52:08.055 --> 52:11.093
Just a guy I met at work.

52:11.093 --> 52:12.508
The boss at the studio?

52:12.508 --> 52:13.647
Shh.

52:13.647 --> 52:16.788
Oh, it is, oh,
honey, that is great.

52:16.788 --> 52:19.170
I mean, you were so
convinced about your dream,

52:19.170 --> 52:22.484
so it's nice to see
that you've moved on.

52:22.484 --> 52:23.312
Sure.

52:25.038 --> 52:27.661
No, I'm happy for
you, very much so.

52:27.661 --> 52:30.008
Okay, thanks, thanks, Mom.

52:35.324 --> 52:38.189
Wonderful, that'll do it.

52:38.189 --> 52:39.190
Thank you.

52:40.536 --> 52:43.470
Let me help you get your coats.

52:43.470 --> 52:45.783
Thank you, dear.

52:45.783 --> 52:49.511
[whimsical orchestral music]

52:51.651 --> 52:54.136
How's your dad doing?

52:54.136 --> 52:56.932
He's well enough,
call him everyday,

52:56.932 --> 52:59.486
try to stop by as much as I can.

52:59.486 --> 53:02.351
You mentioned he's not so great
at taking care of himself.

53:02.351 --> 53:04.905
I'm assuming that
includes cooking.

53:04.905 --> 53:07.494
Burns pancakes
beyond recognition.

53:07.494 --> 53:10.704
Well, I made a big pot
of French onion soup,

53:10.704 --> 53:13.293
and there's plenty left over
if you wanna take some to him.

53:13.293 --> 53:15.985
Well, French onion
soup's his favorite.

53:15.985 --> 53:19.126
That, yeah, that would
be amazing, thank you.

53:19.126 --> 53:20.473
Okay, well, I'll just
go home and get it,

53:20.473 --> 53:21.681
and then you can take it over.

53:21.681 --> 53:24.753
Oh, I'd hate to take
credit for that.

53:24.753 --> 53:27.652
Wanna give it to him yourself?

53:27.652 --> 53:28.481
Sure.

53:30.414 --> 53:34.866
[whimsical orchestral music]

53:34.866 --> 53:37.352
Oh, this is a wonderful treat.

53:37.352 --> 53:39.457
Do you mind if I help
myself to another bowl?

53:39.457 --> 53:40.458
Please do.

53:42.357 --> 53:46.568
Thomas tells me you're making
that studio of his fly.

53:46.568 --> 53:49.191
Well, I'm trying to
help however I can.

53:49.191 --> 53:52.229
Good, he's always
had a camera in hand.

53:52.229 --> 53:53.333
Did you know that?

53:53.333 --> 53:56.198
Yeah, I mean, I'm not surprised.

53:57.751 --> 53:59.408
And you always thought
I'd grow out of it.

53:59.408 --> 54:00.651
Well, all parents
want their kids

54:00.651 --> 54:03.516
to grow up to be
doctors at first.

54:03.516 --> 54:06.035
As long as you can live off
what you choose to do in life,

54:06.035 --> 54:09.763
and are happy, well,
that's all that matters.

54:11.524 --> 54:15.044
Do you have a
favorite photo of his?

54:15.044 --> 54:17.184
Oh, yes.

54:17.184 --> 54:18.013
Oh, no.

54:20.360 --> 54:22.638
Thomas commandeered
the family camera

54:22.638 --> 54:24.640
at age, oh, maybe eight.

54:26.055 --> 54:28.506
Well, he turns nine
and for his birthday,

54:28.506 --> 54:30.577
Mary convinces me
we should cave in,

54:30.577 --> 54:33.787
and buy him a pet
rabbit he wanted.

54:33.787 --> 54:35.272
So, we get him this rabbit.

54:35.272 --> 54:38.447
I never knew he was
a rabbit person.

54:39.690 --> 54:43.003
And he took photo
after photo of it.

54:43.003 --> 54:48.008
He went through so many rolls
of film, we had to limit him.

54:49.424 --> 54:51.564
We made him do extra chores
to pay for all the photos.

54:51.564 --> 54:53.635
You mean like this one.

54:55.015 --> 54:57.811
He posed that rabbit
with carrots, toys,

54:57.811 --> 55:00.538
with me holding it,
with Mary holding it,

55:00.538 --> 55:02.885
him when he could get
the timer to work.

55:02.885 --> 55:04.162
That's adorable.

55:04.162 --> 55:06.268
I remember him arguing
with that rabbit.

55:06.268 --> 55:08.132
I didn't argue with it.

55:08.132 --> 55:12.516
About not moving and holding
the carrot just right.

55:13.758 --> 55:15.070
So, that is how you get

55:15.070 --> 55:17.797
your patience with
child's portraits.

55:17.797 --> 55:18.970
Clearly.

55:18.970 --> 55:20.178
Mm hmm.

55:20.178 --> 55:21.973
I agreed that I wouldn't
tease him about it.

55:21.973 --> 55:25.045
Which I see you're
going back on right now.

55:25.045 --> 55:29.049
As long, as long as I
can keep one on display.

55:33.951 --> 55:37.679
[whimsical orchestral music]

55:40.682 --> 55:42.925
It was really nice
to meet your father.

55:42.925 --> 55:44.789
Well, he clearly
loved the company.

55:44.789 --> 55:45.721
[Megan giggles]

55:45.721 --> 55:47.240
And thank you for the soup.

55:47.240 --> 55:48.379
Oh.

55:48.379 --> 55:49.138
I think he finished
the whole pot.

55:49.138 --> 55:51.209
[Megan giggles]

55:51.209 --> 55:53.695
[bell rings]

55:53.695 --> 55:54.523
Oh, hi.

55:55.766 --> 55:56.594
Hi.

55:58.009 --> 56:00.080
I'm glad that he liked the soup.

56:00.080 --> 56:01.737
Thank you.

56:01.737 --> 56:03.394
Goodnight.

56:04.602 --> 56:06.949
I tried calling and I
stopped by your place,

56:06.949 --> 56:08.157
but you weren't there,

56:08.157 --> 56:10.953
so I just figured you
were working late.

56:10.953 --> 56:13.093
I must've had my
phone off, sorry.

56:13.093 --> 56:15.613
Just getting back
from visiting my dad.

56:15.613 --> 56:17.235
With Megan?

56:17.235 --> 56:21.101
Yeah, she's just sharing
some dinner she made.

56:21.101 --> 56:23.034
That was nice of her.

56:25.520 --> 56:28.005
You've been a little
distant lately.

56:28.005 --> 56:28.833
I must have--

56:28.833 --> 56:30.801
No, hear me out.

56:30.801 --> 56:31.974
It's my fault.

56:34.011 --> 56:38.084
I know I wasn't what you
needed when your mom passed.

56:38.084 --> 56:43.089
I think about things I said
trying to be comforting, but.

56:43.952 --> 56:46.610
I've spent so much time studying

56:46.610 --> 56:49.820
other cultures, other people,

56:49.820 --> 56:53.720
maybe in my work I forgot
to be a person first.

56:56.067 --> 56:59.485
I promise I will be
there for you better.

57:01.625 --> 57:04.662
Natalie, I'm, I'm not upset.

57:04.662 --> 57:06.146
But I am.

57:06.146 --> 57:10.116
I wanted to kick myself calling
you Tommy all this time too.

57:10.116 --> 57:12.290
Even your receptionist knew.

57:12.290 --> 57:13.775
What?

57:13.775 --> 57:17.295
Megan, she said you didn't
like being called Tommy.

57:17.295 --> 57:19.332
How would she know that?

57:19.332 --> 57:20.540
I don't know.

57:21.714 --> 57:24.371
[whimsical orchestral music]

57:24.371 --> 57:27.202
What if Thomas doesn't
see me that way.

57:27.202 --> 57:28.721
You mean as a
potential girlfriend?

57:28.721 --> 57:30.136
No, that sounds so trivial.

57:30.136 --> 57:32.621
I mean as someone he could love.

57:32.621 --> 57:34.692
Are you doubting your
whole dream coma thing?

57:34.692 --> 57:37.730
Well, what if someone
distracts him?

57:37.730 --> 57:39.007
A girlfriend doesn't matter

57:39.007 --> 57:40.318
if he's spending all
this time with you.

57:40.318 --> 57:42.148
Yeah, but I don't
wanna be that person.

57:42.148 --> 57:43.563
What person?

57:43.563 --> 57:45.427
Ah, the person who steals
someone's boyfriend.

57:45.427 --> 57:46.704
Well, is it really stealing

57:46.704 --> 57:49.086
if you know you belong together?

57:49.086 --> 57:51.433
Now you're making me
sound like a stalker.

57:51.433 --> 57:54.505
Okay, you know after your
divorce how you were.

57:54.505 --> 57:56.542
I mean, there were some
hard times, obviously.

57:56.542 --> 57:57.474
Understatement.

57:57.474 --> 57:59.441
And I remember that you thought

57:59.441 --> 58:01.029
you wouldn't get another
happily ever after

58:01.029 --> 58:05.551
because you'd already had
it before it went downhill.

58:05.551 --> 58:08.450
What if things don't work
out the way that I hope?

58:08.450 --> 58:09.934
I'll still be here for you.

58:09.934 --> 58:11.280
We could be two old ladies

58:11.280 --> 58:13.420
who gripe about
Valentine's Day every year,

58:13.420 --> 58:14.939
and cruise dating
sites and apps for men

good enough for us.

[whimsical orchestral music]

58:27.089 --> 58:28.850
Back through there.

58:32.232 --> 58:34.131
You ever get this
point in your life?

58:34.131 --> 58:38.653
Engaged, ah, no, I've
had a few boyfriends,

58:38.653 --> 58:40.862
but none of them the right one.

58:40.862 --> 58:42.139
Okay, guys, that is perfect.

58:42.139 --> 58:44.728
Take a little step over
so I can see the light.

58:44.728 --> 58:46.039
Great, right there.

58:46.039 --> 58:47.558
What about you?

58:47.558 --> 58:50.527
Same, I'm dating
Natalie, of course,

58:50.527 --> 58:53.771
but ah, before that,
nothing, nothing too serious.

58:53.771 --> 58:55.290
Okay, guys, take a
couple steps back,

58:55.290 --> 58:57.119
and then walk
toward me leisurely,

58:57.119 --> 58:58.914

58:58.914 --> 59:01.365
just like that, that's perfect.

They're really
cute, aren't they?

Young.

59:04.264 --> 59:07.198
Yeah.

59:08.061 --> 59:09.511
Kind of makes you wonder, huh?

59:09.511 --> 59:10.961
What?

59:10.961 --> 59:14.240
Well, how someone could be
so sure they're with the one.

59:14.240 --> 59:16.760
Just following their hearts.

59:16.760 --> 59:20.557
Um, that sounded
really warm and fuzzy.

59:20.557 --> 59:21.937
I mean, what about your mind?

59:21.937 --> 59:23.387
You have to follow that too.

59:23.387 --> 59:26.321
Mm hmm, I think most of the time

59:26.321 --> 59:29.427
your heart and your mind
are saying the same things,

59:29.427 --> 59:31.222
just in different ways.

59:31.222 --> 59:33.328
Then why all the confusion?

59:33.328 --> 59:37.574
Maybe you're not being
honest with yourself.

59:37.574 --> 59:38.816
All right, guys, that's great.

59:38.816 --> 59:40.715
Ah, come towards
me one more time,

59:40.715 --> 59:44.477
casually, just relax, be
yourselves, love that.

right here on the bench.

hair real quick?

So, my dad thinks
your a famous chef.

01:00:00.458 --> 01:00:01.701
Hardly.

01:00:01.701 --> 01:00:02.909
Well, apparently, you have

the new best French
onion soup standing, so.

01:00:05.774 --> 01:00:10.572
Well, I'm flattered and
quite frankly, proud.

01:00:10.572 --> 01:00:14.680
Can I ask you ah, why'd you
come with me that night?

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:15.957
What do you mean?

01:00:15.957 --> 01:00:18.649
Not many people would
come visit a stranger.

01:00:18.649 --> 01:00:20.651
Well, how could I not.

01:00:21.548 --> 01:00:23.102
That's not really an answer.

01:00:23.102 --> 01:00:25.345
Can I ask you a question?

01:00:26.795 --> 01:00:28.625
Why did you invite me?

01:00:29.936 --> 01:00:31.110
Okay, ready.

Thanks so much, okay.

What do you look for in a photo?

01:00:46.435 --> 01:00:47.816
How do you mean?

01:00:47.816 --> 01:00:51.095
I mean like what makes
a photo good to you?

01:00:51.095 --> 01:00:54.892
Um, I guess it depends
on the kind of photo.

Hey, come on.

01:01:00.829 --> 01:01:03.970
Okay, so pick something
interesting that you see.

01:01:03.970 --> 01:01:06.041
Interesting, ah, there.

01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:10.667
Is that too obvious?

01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:12.530
Nothing's too obvious.

01:01:12.530 --> 01:01:15.188
You just gotta find
something unique about it,

01:01:15.188 --> 01:01:18.502
a composition, a
framing, an element

01:01:18.502 --> 01:01:22.609
that comes together and
makes the photo pop.

01:01:22.609 --> 01:01:23.818
But not just the main part

01:01:23.818 --> 01:01:25.785
of the photo,
everything together.

Okay.

Come on.

And don't stress about it.

that's interesting.

perfectly framed.

01:01:52.087 --> 01:01:53.226
Ah, come here.

01:01:54.538 --> 01:01:57.023
Now, don't just focus
on the tower itself.

01:01:57.023 --> 01:02:00.371
It's everything around it
that can make it interesting.

01:02:00.371 --> 01:02:01.787
So, like you take that tower,

01:02:01.787 --> 01:02:02.891
and you put that in the middle
of a warehouse district,

01:02:02.891 --> 01:02:05.238
it changes the entire photo.

01:02:05.238 --> 01:02:09.380

makes that interesting?

something unique.

behind the camera?

around just in case.

and one for here?

much a good tripod costs?

it's so expensive,

all that about me?

Megan, maybe we should
call someone for you.

01:04:00.733 --> 01:04:03.218
No, listen, I was
in a car accident,

01:04:03.218 --> 01:04:05.186
and it put me in a
coma for two months,

01:04:05.186 --> 01:04:08.637
and I don't know how
or why, but I saw you,

01:04:08.637 --> 01:04:12.849

beautiful life together,

and two beautiful children.

I'm not explaining
this very well.

Listen, everybody told
me that it was a dream,

01:04:21.305 --> 01:04:23.031
and I started to believe them

01:04:23.031 --> 01:04:26.759
until I met you here,
completely by chance,

01:04:26.759 --> 01:04:30.936
and that has to mean
something, right, it has to.

01:04:30.936 --> 01:04:33.248

up a story about me,

01:04:33.248 --> 01:04:35.802

No, no, it's, it's memories.

Don't you see?

01:04:41.636 --> 01:04:44.881
Look, the color purple,
it's your favorite color,

01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:47.918
but you lie and tell
everybody that it's green,

more purple shirts and ties

No, it's because you
think the number of games

baseball is ridiculous

to care about.

hangs in our house of me

01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:05.444
Isabelle and Dylan, they're?

01:06:06.963 --> 01:06:10.690
Our children, look, I
know how that sounds.

01:06:11.864 --> 01:06:15.316
It's, it's bizarre,
but it, but it's true.

01:06:18.388 --> 01:06:22.116
I believe that you
think this is real,

01:06:22.116 --> 01:06:23.634
and you think it
means something,

01:06:23.634 --> 01:06:26.706
but just because you think
it, doesn't mean that I do.

01:06:26.706 --> 01:06:30.020
[mellow music]

01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:32.057
I think you need to leave now.

01:06:32.057 --> 01:06:34.611
[mellow music]

01:06:34.611 --> 01:06:35.715
Okay, okay.

01:06:40.306 --> 01:06:42.895
[mellow music]

01:07:15.997 --> 01:07:19.725
Woman in coma after
horrific wreck.

01:07:19.725 --> 01:07:22.314
[mellow music]

01:07:30.770 --> 01:07:34.498
I'm gonna make some scrambled
eggs, you want some?

01:07:34.498 --> 01:07:36.604
No, Megan lost her job.

01:07:38.847 --> 01:07:40.918
What happened?

01:07:40.918 --> 01:07:42.713
She said the temp agency called,

01:07:42.713 --> 01:07:45.406
and the studio didn't
need her anymore.

01:07:45.406 --> 01:07:49.099
Oh, well, maybe
it's for the best.

01:07:49.099 --> 01:07:53.621
I'll call Bob Wentworth, see
if that job's still open.

01:07:55.381 --> 01:07:57.003
You have to see him.

01:07:57.003 --> 01:07:59.454
I'm pretty sure he'll lock
his door if he sees me coming,

01:07:59.454 --> 01:08:02.043
or call a stated
ordered psychiatrist.

01:08:02.043 --> 01:08:03.320
Did he understand it all?

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:05.805
Ah, did you the first
time I told you?

01:08:05.805 --> 01:08:07.013
See, exactly my point.

01:08:07.013 --> 01:08:08.705
It's not a one sitting
type conversation.

01:08:08.705 --> 01:08:10.189
You can call him.

01:08:10.189 --> 01:08:11.811
He fired me, Eve.

01:08:11.811 --> 01:08:14.366
Then you have nothing to lose.

01:08:14.366 --> 01:08:16.506
Nothing I haven't lost already.

01:08:16.506 --> 01:08:17.506
He's not gonna answer.

01:08:17.506 --> 01:08:19.024
Well, we'll see.

01:08:20.268 --> 01:08:21.096
[telephone ringing]

01:08:21.096 --> 01:08:22.719
Here, it's ringing.

01:08:24.582 --> 01:08:25.515
You've reached Berry
Patch Photography.

01:08:25.515 --> 01:08:26.240
It's going to studio voicemail.

01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:27.724
Leave a message.

01:08:27.724 --> 01:08:28.380
It's not the type of thing
you leave a message--

01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:29.898
It's gonna beep.

01:08:29.898 --> 01:08:32.004
Hi, ah, hi, it's Megan.

01:08:33.143 --> 01:08:36.077
Ah, if you haven't
hung up already,

01:08:37.216 --> 01:08:39.356
I don't know what to say.

01:08:39.356 --> 01:08:43.602
Um, I don't blame you for
how you took what I said.

01:08:46.604 --> 01:08:48.710
I didn't tell you
because I was afraid

01:08:48.710 --> 01:08:51.368
you'd react exactly how you did.

01:08:54.130 --> 01:08:56.096
Maybe I should've
ignored what happened,

01:08:56.096 --> 01:08:59.100
but maybe one day
you'll understand,

01:09:02.586 --> 01:09:06.417
and if you don't, I just
want you to be happy.

01:09:11.388 --> 01:09:15.011
Ah, so, good luck with
everything, and bye.

01:09:19.327 --> 01:09:22.122
[mellow music]

01:09:22.122 --> 01:09:24.676
[Megan groans]

01:09:28.957 --> 01:09:31.201
The department budget just
came out for next year,

01:09:31.201 --> 01:09:33.029
and it's peanuts,

01:09:33.029 --> 01:09:35.171
but I keep hearing rumors
of a private donor or two,

01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:36.930
circling the university.

01:09:36.930 --> 01:09:37.932
Maybe that'll change things,

01:09:37.932 --> 01:09:40.590
but right now, I
would be shocked

01:09:40.590 --> 01:09:43.317
to find new grants
for this new position.

01:09:43.317 --> 01:09:45.250
I did apply for a
couple of grants,

01:09:45.250 --> 01:09:48.460
and if they go
through, you know,

01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:52.809
there may be some bargaining
for the university too.

01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:56.640
That boss is crazy
to let you go.

01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:57.848
Let it go, Howard.

01:09:57.848 --> 01:09:59.160
I'm just saying.

01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:01.438
Well, you just
said, let's move on.

01:10:01.438 --> 01:10:03.371
She's obviously upset about it.

01:10:03.371 --> 01:10:04.924
Dad, it's fine.

01:10:04.924 --> 01:10:07.375
Well, Bob Wentworth is
ready to interview you.

01:10:07.375 --> 01:10:08.652
Dad.

01:10:08.652 --> 01:10:09.895
He's still looking
for an assistant?

01:10:09.895 --> 01:10:12.380
Yeah, he tried one,
but it was a disaster.

01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:14.313
Did I give you his
number last time?

01:10:14.313 --> 01:10:15.728
Yes, thank you.

01:10:15.728 --> 01:10:16.660
Okay.

01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:18.075
And I'm still not interested.

01:10:18.075 --> 01:10:19.422
Howard, she needs time.

01:10:19.422 --> 01:10:22.321
Time, this isn't a breakup.

01:10:22.321 --> 01:10:23.805
The temp job's over.

01:10:23.805 --> 01:10:25.876
This is a great time
for bigger and better.

01:10:25.876 --> 01:10:26.912
Not if she's--

01:10:26.912 --> 01:10:29.190
I'm gonna be a writer.

01:10:29.190 --> 01:10:30.571
For a job?

01:10:30.571 --> 01:10:31.572
Hopefully.

01:10:32.676 --> 01:10:34.230
Now, Megan, we talked
about this and--

01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:36.646
I know what you think,

01:10:36.646 --> 01:10:38.406
but it's what I want.

01:10:40.408 --> 01:10:44.550
It's time I go after a
dream I can make come true.

01:10:45.827 --> 01:10:48.244
All right.

01:10:48.244 --> 01:10:49.486
Post the test scores tomorrow.

01:10:49.486 --> 01:10:51.039
I don't wanna ruin
anyone's night,

01:10:51.039 --> 01:10:53.179
and let's copy
these for next week.

01:10:53.179 --> 01:10:54.664
Got it.

01:10:54.664 --> 01:10:55.630
Hey.

01:10:55.630 --> 01:10:58.254
Hi, what are you doing here?

01:10:58.254 --> 01:11:01.257
Do we wanna get some takeout?

01:11:01.257 --> 01:11:02.672
No.

01:11:02.672 --> 01:11:03.949
What's wrong?

01:11:05.882 --> 01:11:07.642
Is it that other girl, the temp?

01:11:07.642 --> 01:11:12.164
No, no, she was ah, she
doesn't work for me anymore.

01:11:14.131 --> 01:11:19.136
I just realized I needed
to be honest with myself,

01:11:19.136 --> 01:11:20.586
and I think I was just
letting this keep going,

01:11:20.586 --> 01:11:22.519
because it felt easier,

01:11:24.659 --> 01:11:28.525
and that's not how
I wanna treat you.

01:11:28.525 --> 01:11:31.148
I appreciate that, I suppose.

01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:36.292
Maybe the timing's for the best.

01:11:36.292 --> 01:11:40.399
Yeah, why's that?

01:11:40.399 --> 01:11:44.645
I got approval on a
field study to China.

01:11:44.645 --> 01:11:45.956
China?

01:11:45.956 --> 01:11:48.649
I'm going to tour the
country for six months

01:11:48.649 --> 01:11:52.238
studying the variations of
lifestyle in different villages,

01:11:52.238 --> 01:11:55.552
and their impact
on the dialects.

01:11:55.552 --> 01:11:57.865
Wow, that's, that's great.

01:12:00.730 --> 01:12:03.422
I would've loved to
have you come with me,

01:12:03.422 --> 01:12:06.701
especially since I know how
much you enjoy Chinese food.

01:12:06.701 --> 01:12:09.497
Yeah, I guess I'll just have

01:12:09.497 --> 01:12:11.499
to make do with takeout.

01:12:13.363 --> 01:12:14.709
I'll miss you.

01:12:16.090 --> 01:12:17.471
No, you won't.

01:12:17.471 --> 01:12:18.403
You'll get going.

01:12:18.403 --> 01:12:19.714
You'll get lost in your work,

01:12:19.714 --> 01:12:20.888
and you'll come back wishing

01:12:20.888 --> 01:12:23.753
you could've stayed
there forever.

01:12:23.753 --> 01:12:26.583
And you, what will you be doing?

01:12:27.481 --> 01:12:28.930
Moving forward.

01:12:32.382 --> 01:12:34.729
You sure you wanna
sell mom's car?

01:12:34.729 --> 01:12:36.593
I don't need two cars.

01:12:36.593 --> 01:12:41.115
Besides, I can never see
well when I drove that.

01:12:41.115 --> 01:12:42.668
[camera shutter clicking]

01:12:42.668 --> 01:12:45.084
Listen, I know your grossly
overqualified for this,

01:12:45.084 --> 01:12:46.465
but thank you.

01:12:46.465 --> 01:12:47.742
Ah, I'm happy to help, Dad.

01:12:47.742 --> 01:12:49.641
Don't worry about that.

01:12:50.642 --> 01:12:52.298
So, how's Natalie?

01:12:53.783 --> 01:12:56.682
She's good, we
broke up actually.

01:12:58.166 --> 01:13:00.376
She take it okay?

01:13:00.376 --> 01:13:02.516
How'd you know I was the
one who broke up with her?

01:13:02.516 --> 01:13:05.346
[Dad chuckles]

01:13:05.346 --> 01:13:08.625
Yeah, she was pretty
okay about it.

01:13:08.625 --> 01:13:11.559
How's the French
onion soup girl?

01:13:11.559 --> 01:13:13.250
She's, she's fine.

01:13:15.114 --> 01:13:18.497
That sounds a lot
more complicated.

01:13:18.497 --> 01:13:21.189
She wasn't exactly
who I though she was.

01:13:21.189 --> 01:13:22.777
I had to let her
go unfortunately.

01:13:22.777 --> 01:13:24.503
Oh, that's too bad.

01:13:26.332 --> 01:13:27.920
She seemed special.

01:13:29.335 --> 01:13:33.339
Yeah, maybe, got ah,
well, it got complicated.

01:13:36.412 --> 01:13:37.274
I see.

01:13:38.690 --> 01:13:41.071
I think I got some
good options here.

01:13:41.071 --> 01:13:42.556
Good, and while your here,

01:13:42.556 --> 01:13:45.421
you can put those on the
computer and list it for me.

01:13:45.421 --> 01:13:47.284
You know, it's not
really all that hard.

01:13:47.284 --> 01:13:49.425
It wasn't hard when I
just called the newspaper

01:13:49.425 --> 01:13:51.427
and told them what to type up.

01:13:51.427 --> 01:13:53.359
They don't do that anymore.

01:13:53.359 --> 01:13:54.291
Okay.

01:13:54.291 --> 01:13:55.465
Come on, I'll make you some

01:13:55.465 --> 01:13:56.846
hot chocolate while
you're working.

01:13:56.846 --> 01:13:59.676
[Thomas chuckles]

01:14:01.229 --> 01:14:03.715
[Megan sighs]

01:14:08.340 --> 01:14:10.963
[knocking on door]

01:14:10.963 --> 01:14:12.033
Mom?

01:14:12.033 --> 01:14:13.241
Sorry to barge in.

01:14:13.241 --> 01:14:15.554
I needed to talk to you.

01:14:15.554 --> 01:14:17.453
If this is about Mr.
Wentworth and the job, I--

01:14:17.453 --> 01:14:19.731
Eve told me about Thomas.

01:14:22.009 --> 01:14:25.357
I never imagined your
boss would be him.

01:14:27.083 --> 01:14:27.911
Thomas.

01:14:29.188 --> 01:14:30.017
Yeah.

01:14:31.570 --> 01:14:34.470
You still don't believe
it's the same man, do you?

01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:36.610
No, I do, I believe you.

01:14:38.646 --> 01:14:39.475
Now.

01:14:40.683 --> 01:14:44.100
Yes, before I [sighs].

01:14:46.067 --> 01:14:48.691
How does someone wrap
their head around that?

01:14:48.691 --> 01:14:52.142
It can't be real, but
you didn't give up.

01:14:53.558 --> 01:14:57.493
And I see now that doesn't
mean you made something up.

01:14:58.839 --> 01:15:01.117
You never stopped believing.

01:15:02.567 --> 01:15:06.156
Doesn't matter, because
I lost him again.

01:15:07.330 --> 01:15:10.506
Maybe, but don't
start quitting now.

01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:15.234
He basically thinks I'm crazy,

01:15:15.234 --> 01:15:18.479
which is a pretty
common reaction I think.

01:15:18.479 --> 01:15:22.034
Honey, who cares what
other people think?

01:15:23.277 --> 01:15:25.969
You stood your ground
now about your writing,

01:15:25.969 --> 01:15:28.869
and to be honest,
I'm proud of you.

01:15:31.734 --> 01:15:34.391
So, stand your ground.

01:15:34.391 --> 01:15:39.155
If you really love him, as I
know you do, hang onto that.

01:15:40.363 --> 01:15:42.468
I know that I love him,

01:15:43.608 --> 01:15:46.127
and I know that
he could love me,

01:15:46.127 --> 01:15:47.888
but I can't make him.

01:15:52.962 --> 01:15:56.068
When you were in the hospital,

01:15:56.068 --> 01:15:58.726
the doctors and nurses, they ah,

01:15:59.865 --> 01:16:03.593
they told me everyday
to prepare myself,

01:16:03.593 --> 01:16:05.837
that you might not make it,

01:16:07.183 --> 01:16:10.600
that you would
probably never wake.

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:14.535
I couldn't give up, but
I could keep believing.

01:16:15.398 --> 01:16:18.643
No one could take that from me.

01:16:18.643 --> 01:16:23.648
What you've been through is
powerful, don't doubt it.

01:16:24.787 --> 01:16:26.754
I'll be here for
you, no matter what.

01:16:28.307 --> 01:16:29.481
Thanks, Mom.

01:16:31.138 --> 01:16:33.416
[telephone ringing]

01:16:33.416 --> 01:16:35.452
Clarissa, it's Clarissa, right?

01:16:35.452 --> 01:16:37.627
Could you get that, please?

01:16:39.595 --> 01:16:41.389
Photography studio.

01:16:42.528 --> 01:16:44.116
It's ah, Berry Patch.

01:16:44.116 --> 01:16:47.188
Uh huh, when did
you wanna come in?

01:16:50.226 --> 01:16:52.538
Tuesday at 10 a.m.

01:16:52.538 --> 01:16:56.197
Fine, give me your
name then, okay.

01:16:56.197 --> 01:16:57.647
[mellow music]

01:16:57.647 --> 01:17:01.893
Pine Creek Farmhouse,
I've been there, sort of.

01:17:03.066 --> 01:17:05.621
I'm guessing it's one
of your favorite spots.

01:17:05.621 --> 01:17:07.830
Bye, bye.

01:17:07.830 --> 01:17:10.211
Maybe she did already know.

01:17:10.211 --> 01:17:11.212
Excuse me?

01:17:13.145 --> 01:17:13.974
Nothing.

01:17:20.187 --> 01:17:21.015
What're you writing then?

01:17:21.015 --> 01:17:22.189
Did you decide?

01:17:22.189 --> 01:17:23.742
I'm actually working
on two things,

01:17:23.742 --> 01:17:26.434
one is a children's
story about a superhero

01:17:26.434 --> 01:17:28.644
named Boy Dino and
the Wizard Isabelle.

01:17:28.644 --> 01:17:29.541
I like that.

01:17:29.541 --> 01:17:30.991
What about the other?

01:17:30.991 --> 01:17:33.856
The second is about a woman
who wakes up from a coma

01:17:33.856 --> 01:17:36.721
with the memory of a husband
and children who do not exist,

01:17:36.721 --> 01:17:40.103
and everybody
thinks she's crazy,

01:17:40.103 --> 01:17:42.002
and then she meets that husband.

01:17:42.002 --> 01:17:43.659
I'd buy that.

01:17:43.659 --> 01:17:44.867
Does it have a happy ending?

01:17:44.867 --> 01:17:46.385
Yeah, benefits of fiction.

01:17:46.385 --> 01:17:49.595
Well, when you need an
editor, I'm here for you.

01:17:49.595 --> 01:17:53.910
You misuse your and you're
literally all the time.

01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:58.087
I will offer a reader's
perspective, not grammar.

01:17:58.087 --> 01:18:00.054
Mm hmm.

01:18:00.054 --> 01:18:02.608
[mellow music]

01:18:14.068 --> 01:18:15.449
There's a portrait
that hangs in our house

01:18:15.449 --> 01:18:18.694
of me in front of
that exact same barn.

01:18:20.316 --> 01:18:23.595
How could she have
known I took that?

01:18:24.596 --> 01:18:27.599
[whimsical orchestral music]

01:18:27.599 --> 01:18:30.050
[telephone ringing]

01:18:30.050 --> 01:18:31.292
Libby King.

01:18:31.292 --> 01:18:33.536
Hey, Libby, Thomas
Claybourne here.

01:18:33.536 --> 01:18:36.815
Ah, so I was just going through
the receptionists desk here,

01:18:36.815 --> 01:18:40.025
and I found some things
Megan Murphy left behind.

01:18:40.025 --> 01:18:41.544
Oh, I can give her a call.

01:18:41.544 --> 01:18:43.926
Is there an address
I can send that to?

01:18:43.926 --> 01:18:46.204
Let me look at what I have.

01:18:46.204 --> 01:18:48.793
[mellow music]

01:18:55.661 --> 01:18:58.595
[doorbell buzzing]

01:19:01.702 --> 01:19:03.842
Who are you looking for?

01:19:04.878 --> 01:19:06.983
Ah, Megan Murphy.

01:19:06.983 --> 01:19:08.847
Oh, ah, she must not be home.

01:19:08.847 --> 01:19:10.297
Who are you?

01:19:10.297 --> 01:19:11.885
Ah, Thomas.

01:19:11.885 --> 01:19:13.196
Thomas?

01:19:13.196 --> 01:19:15.164
Do you know Megan?

01:19:15.164 --> 01:19:16.406
I'm her mother.

01:19:16.406 --> 01:19:17.235
Oh.

01:19:18.408 --> 01:19:19.824
So, you're him.

01:19:23.689 --> 01:19:26.934
Seems so.

01:19:28.867 --> 01:19:30.489
Why are you here?

01:19:31.456 --> 01:19:33.527
I need to tell her, ah,

01:19:35.184 --> 01:19:38.359
I haven't really
phrased it right yet.

01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:43.088
Do you think she
imagined it all?

01:19:43.088 --> 01:19:46.678
Yeah, but she was
right about everything.

01:19:50.130 --> 01:19:53.167
So, you'll give her a chance?

01:19:53.167 --> 01:19:57.862
Honestly, I'm more worried
about her giving me a chance.

01:19:57.862 --> 01:20:00.623
Do you know when she'll be back?

01:20:00.623 --> 01:20:03.177
She's been writing a lot lately.

01:20:03.177 --> 01:20:05.317
Writing, really?

01:20:05.317 --> 01:20:07.319
I can give her a call.

01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:11.668
No wait, I think I know
where to find her, thank you.

01:20:11.668 --> 01:20:15.431
[whimsical orchestral music]

01:20:33.656 --> 01:20:36.970
Sorry to barge in on
your favorite spot.

01:20:38.834 --> 01:20:40.628
It's a public place.

01:20:42.182 --> 01:20:45.737
So ah, I need a
receptionist, a good one.

01:20:47.877 --> 01:20:49.879
I'm pretty sure you let me go.

01:20:49.879 --> 01:20:51.777
Any chance you'd
forget about that?

01:20:51.777 --> 01:20:56.058
Contrary to popular belief,
I do not have amnesia.

01:20:58.025 --> 01:20:59.958
Got your message.

01:20:59.958 --> 01:21:01.166
You didn't call me back.

01:21:01.166 --> 01:21:04.618
I know, I couldn't
handle what you said.

01:21:05.791 --> 01:21:08.587
It was easier for
me to push it away,

01:21:08.587 --> 01:21:12.695
till I realized maybe this
isn't so unbelievable.

01:21:15.629 --> 01:21:17.182
You recognize this?

01:21:22.601 --> 01:21:24.431
It hangs in our house.

01:21:24.431 --> 01:21:27.123
I took that that day
at the farmhouse,

01:21:27.123 --> 01:21:28.607
and I didn't show it
to you at the studio,

01:21:28.607 --> 01:21:32.542
because I thought you
would think it was creepy.

01:21:33.647 --> 01:21:36.339
I know, under normal
circumstances.

01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:41.172
Nothing about this is normal.

01:21:41.172 --> 01:21:44.589
It's not normal to know
this much about a stranger.

01:21:44.589 --> 01:21:46.556
I can't help that
I know that much.

01:21:46.556 --> 01:21:49.283
I know, and that made me think.

01:21:51.078 --> 01:21:54.530
You know almost
everything about me,

01:21:54.530 --> 01:21:58.120
and honestly, Megan,
that scares me,

01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:02.124
until I started thinking about
how much I know about you.

01:22:02.124 --> 01:22:04.057
You are good with kids.

01:22:04.989 --> 01:22:06.576
You work hard.

01:22:06.576 --> 01:22:10.649
You even find ways to fix things
I didn't know were broken.

01:22:10.649 --> 01:22:12.858
You care about what you do,

01:22:12.858 --> 01:22:15.792
even if it's not your dream job.

01:22:15.792 --> 01:22:17.104
You make a mean bowl of soup.

01:22:17.104 --> 01:22:19.210
[Megan giggles]

01:22:19.210 --> 01:22:21.453
And you care about
the people around you.

01:22:21.453 --> 01:22:23.662
And even when I pushed you away,

01:22:23.662 --> 01:22:26.942
you just wanted me to be happy,

01:22:26.942 --> 01:22:29.461
and I, I couldn't
let go of that.

01:22:29.461 --> 01:22:33.051
And I thought if I know
this much about you,

01:22:33.051 --> 01:22:35.743
how could I not wanna know more?

01:22:37.780 --> 01:22:40.507
I don't know, but you're wrong.

01:22:43.579 --> 01:22:44.407
I am?

01:22:46.064 --> 01:22:49.965
About me knowing
everything about you.

01:22:49.965 --> 01:22:51.725
I didn't know about
the rabbit thing,

01:22:51.725 --> 01:22:54.210
and that's really weird.

01:22:54.210 --> 01:22:56.695
[both chuckle]

01:22:56.695 --> 01:22:58.732
Maybe we can figure out

01:22:59.975 --> 01:23:02.839
what we don't know
about each other.

01:23:02.839 --> 01:23:05.325
Yeah, I'd like that.

01:23:05.325 --> 01:23:09.087
[whimsical orchestral music]

01:23:16.508 --> 01:23:20.133
I hope I live up to
what you know about me.

01:23:20.133 --> 01:23:21.651
I'm not worried.

01:23:22.894 --> 01:23:27.243
And maybe we can go on
a real date, dinner?

01:23:27.243 --> 01:23:28.589
I'd like that.

01:23:31.834 --> 01:23:35.596
[whimsical orchestral music]

01:23:45.641 --> 01:23:49.058
[sighs] What do you
think, is that straight?

01:23:49.058 --> 01:23:50.094
I like it.

01:23:50.094 --> 01:23:52.786
Nice job, Mrs. Claybourne.

01:23:52.786 --> 01:23:53.614
Want some?

01:23:55.099 --> 01:23:56.307
Hot chocolate?

01:23:56.307 --> 01:23:58.930
Of course, don't
you know me at all?

01:23:58.930 --> 01:24:00.725
Mm hmm.

01:24:00.725 --> 01:24:04.177
[whimsical orchestral music]

01:24:04.177 --> 01:24:05.695
This is perfect.

01:24:07.421 --> 01:24:08.595
Yeah, it is.

01:24:13.082 --> 01:24:16.879
