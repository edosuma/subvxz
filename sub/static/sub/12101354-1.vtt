00:12.828 --> 00:14.931
<i>"Dear diary.
I finally got the courage</i>

00:14.964 --> 00:16.898
<i>to write a good-bye letter
to my father.</i>

00:16.932 --> 00:19.569
<i>'Dad, I am thankful
for all you've done for me.</i>

00:19.602 --> 00:22.371
<i>But I can't be afraid for
my physical health anymore.</i>

00:22.404 --> 00:25.274
<i>You don't listen. You're lost!</i>

00:25.307 --> 00:27.810
<i>I hope you find peace
and forgive yourself.</i>

00:27.843 --> 00:32.948
<i>I'm sorry, I can't stay here.
Not like this. It's time.</i>

00:32.982 --> 00:37.320
<i>Goodbye. I love you.
I'm fucking out of here.'"</i>

00:52.034 --> 00:55.505
I'm just starting to realize
how much I'm gonna miss my mom.

01:03.512 --> 01:06.348
Do you think it's a good
idea to turn our phones on?

01:06.381 --> 01:07.916
I just wanted to tell her
I'm okay,

01:07.949 --> 01:11.253
- and that I'm sorry...
- Lily!

01:11.287 --> 01:12.555
Okay, you're right.

01:14.589 --> 01:16.392
Is it off?

01:16.425 --> 01:17.893
Neil, I'm not stupid.

01:20.595 --> 01:21.963
Are you serious right now?

01:21.996 --> 01:25.300
You'll get it back
once you start thinking clearly.

01:55.963 --> 01:56.965
Don't.

01:59.100 --> 02:00.669
You told me he didn't hit you.

02:02.970 --> 02:04.407
It's nothing.

02:04.440 --> 02:06.842
Get your lazy ass outside now!

02:06.874 --> 02:08.910
Leave me alone.

02:08.944 --> 02:12.348
Look at your daddy
when he's talking to you.

02:12.380 --> 02:14.950
You're not my dad
and you smell like a cheap beer.

02:18.520 --> 02:20.856
We said we'd be honest
with each other.

02:51.552 --> 02:52.688
Do we still have water?

02:54.556 --> 02:55.558
No.

02:57.058 --> 02:59.127
How much longer?

02:59.160 --> 03:00.762
Just a little.

03:06.534 --> 03:07.969
This looks like a good place.

03:08.003 --> 03:09.472
For bears, maybe.

03:11.105 --> 03:13.908
You know, I never realized
how much anxiety you have.

03:13.942 --> 03:15.677
You would
if you really knew me.

03:15.711 --> 03:18.113
Stay here.

03:18.147 --> 03:20.650
Let me see if I can
find that river.

03:24.420 --> 03:26.689
You can pitch the tent
while I'm gone.

03:26.722 --> 03:28.057
I won't be long.

03:48.075 --> 03:49.010
Oh, no.

03:53.849 --> 03:55.818
Neil!

03:57.785 --> 03:59.921
Neil!

04:15.037 --> 04:19.608
I asked you to clean up
the kitchen and what did you do?

04:19.640 --> 04:23.111
Run off to your room
to write in your fucking diary.

04:26.481 --> 04:29.452
Now maybe we'll get some
actual work done around here.

04:38.527 --> 04:39.462
Neil?

04:41.597 --> 04:42.931
Are you there?

05:58.974 --> 06:02.712
Hello? Is anyone here?

06:21.897 --> 06:23.065
Oh, God.

06:36.344 --> 06:39.047
Hi. Um....

06:40.248 --> 06:41.918
Hello, sir, I-I need help.

06:45.621 --> 06:47.823
I'm so sorry for banging
on the door like that.

06:49.924 --> 06:53.127
- I was with my boyfriend...
- It's all right. It's all right.

06:53.161 --> 06:54.597
I'm just happy you're safe.

06:56.832 --> 06:58.734
Thanks.
Do you have a phone...

06:58.767 --> 07:02.972
Don't just stand there.
Come inside. Come on.

07:06.241 --> 07:08.611
I'll get you some water.

07:08.644 --> 07:10.913
Thanks. You're very kind.

07:10.945 --> 07:12.080
Can I use your phone?

07:12.113 --> 07:14.282
My boyfriend
probably needs help.

07:17.719 --> 07:18.654
Here.

07:20.322 --> 07:22.758
- I really need to use the phone.
- Here you go.

07:30.065 --> 07:32.635
- Oh...
- I'm so sorry.

07:32.667 --> 07:33.902
I'm not mad.

07:35.736 --> 07:39.775
You stink. You go take a shower,
we'll talk later.

07:39.808 --> 07:40.810
Excuse me?

07:43.044 --> 07:46.280
Um, thank you
for the glass of water,

07:46.313 --> 07:49.149
but I think it's better
if I go now.

07:49.183 --> 07:52.087
Where you're going?
Hey! No, no, wait, wait, wait.

07:52.120 --> 07:53.389
Hey, Come back here.

07:53.421 --> 07:54.922
What is the matter with you?

07:54.955 --> 07:56.325
What do you want from me?

07:56.358 --> 07:57.793
I want you to come inside

07:57.825 --> 07:59.761
so we can have
a normal conversation.

07:59.794 --> 08:01.830
- What?
- I am not gonna say it again!

08:04.099 --> 08:06.068
- Get inside now.
- Okay.

08:09.337 --> 08:11.407
- What do you... Wait...
- Come on. You come.

08:13.308 --> 08:16.312
Oh, God. Stay.

08:18.412 --> 08:21.216
Oh. Goddamn it.

08:29.056 --> 08:30.659
Give me your bag.

08:32.360 --> 08:33.428
Come on.

08:37.399 --> 08:38.333
Sit.

08:41.870 --> 08:42.871
Please.

08:46.475 --> 08:47.877
More water?

08:52.114 --> 08:54.783
You don't understand how serious
my situation is.

08:54.816 --> 08:56.785
Well, you can tell me.

08:56.818 --> 08:59.087
I'm here for you.

08:59.121 --> 09:01.323
There's nothing to tell you.
I don't get it!

09:01.356 --> 09:04.793
- I came here for help and...
- Hey, shh, shh.

09:04.826 --> 09:08.163
- You hear me yelling?
- You were a minute ago.

09:08.196 --> 09:09.431
I'm sorry.

09:09.463 --> 09:11.132
- This is ridiculous.
- No, sit down!

09:11.165 --> 09:13.434
- You can't tell me what to do...
- You... Sit!

09:19.540 --> 09:22.276
- I just wanna go.
- You wanna go.

09:22.309 --> 09:24.279
Well, you can come with me then.
Come on.

09:24.312 --> 09:25.948
- What are you doing?
- Shut up. I don't wanna hear it.

09:25.981 --> 09:27.282
- You are coming with me now.
- You are hurting me.

09:27.314 --> 09:28.784
And you are going in here.

09:28.817 --> 09:31.352
Get in there.
Get in and think about it.

09:34.389 --> 09:37.058
Let me out, you psycho!

10:27.141 --> 10:29.778
Let me out, you psycho.

11:50.191 --> 11:52.127
I've got to get the hell
out of here.

11:59.701 --> 12:01.135
What are you doing?

12:04.105 --> 12:06.308
What were you gonna do
with that?

12:06.341 --> 12:08.543
Get away from me.

12:08.576 --> 12:10.946
Well, I was gonna come down
and let you out.

12:10.978 --> 12:12.480
I was gonna say sorry,
but now

12:12.514 --> 12:15.484
I find you've been messing
around with all my stuff.

12:18.720 --> 12:21.390
Congratulations.
You're grounded.

13:08.569 --> 13:11.539
I thought
you'd be hungry by now.

13:15.376 --> 13:17.145
Sorry I left you down here,

13:17.178 --> 13:18.612
but you left me no choice.

13:18.645 --> 13:20.281
What's going on?

13:20.314 --> 13:22.183
Come upstairs,
we'll get you a shower.

13:22.217 --> 13:24.352
Don't touch me.

13:24.385 --> 13:26.054
I'm not gonna hurt you.

13:28.055 --> 13:29.424
I wanna go find my boyfriend.

13:29.457 --> 13:33.195
Enough with this shit.
You just do as I say.

13:35.764 --> 13:37.466
I'm sorry.

13:37.499 --> 13:42.471
I'm sorry, I... Look...

13:42.504 --> 13:45.741
I'll get you a new sandwich.
We'll sort everything out.

13:45.774 --> 13:47.542
How does that sound?

13:47.574 --> 13:49.310
I can't have you leaving again.

13:49.343 --> 13:50.445
Again?

13:52.313 --> 13:54.750
I can't even talk to you,
for God's sake!

13:54.783 --> 13:59.321
It's okay, honey.
Come here. Give me a hug.

13:59.353 --> 14:02.056
- Leave me alone!
- What is the matter with you?

14:02.090 --> 14:05.226
What's the matter with me? Does
any of this make sense to you?

14:05.260 --> 14:06.727
All right, that is it.

14:06.760 --> 14:09.063
- I'm not playing games.
- What are you doing? Stop!

14:09.097 --> 14:10.231
- Get off me.
- Come with me.

14:10.265 --> 14:12.601
You get in here, now!
In you go.

14:18.807 --> 14:19.741
Hop on!

14:21.576 --> 14:23.077
You're crazy!

14:23.111 --> 14:25.614
- It's time for you to train.
- Train for what?

14:25.646 --> 14:27.448
Can we just try
to make this work?

14:27.481 --> 14:30.785
You promise not to grab me
like that again?

14:30.818 --> 14:32.253
I'm really sorry.

14:35.557 --> 14:37.759
What can I do
to make it right?

14:37.792 --> 14:40.062
Just leave me alone.

14:45.632 --> 14:47.635
I'll give you the weekend.

14:53.374 --> 14:54.676
Goodnight.

15:28.409 --> 15:30.379
Let me out, please.

15:36.851 --> 15:39.321
Let me out, please.

15:51.399 --> 15:52.801
Let me out, please.

15:58.740 --> 16:00.875
Just let me out, please.

16:02.809 --> 16:04.612
It's Sunday.

16:04.645 --> 16:07.281
Sunday is a day of rest.

16:07.314 --> 16:10.151
So how about you save your
strength, stop all the yelling

16:10.184 --> 16:12.286
and accept this is the way
things have to be

16:12.319 --> 16:15.189
I'm not gonna let it happen
again. You're going to win.

16:15.222 --> 16:17.192
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

16:17.225 --> 16:19.161
- Stay focused.
- What am I supposed to win?

16:19.193 --> 16:21.295
- I told you many times.
- Win what? Win what?

16:21.328 --> 16:23.298
We both need a clear mind. Argh!

16:25.699 --> 16:26.834
Enough.

16:30.404 --> 16:31.573
One more day.

16:34.976 --> 16:38.347
Wait. Please. I'm hungry.

16:39.646 --> 16:40.781
I know.

16:42.382 --> 16:45.452
What are you doing?
I asked you to wash the car.

16:45.486 --> 16:47.856
Can I please do it tomorrow?
I just got my period.

18:30.490 --> 18:32.627
Morning.
How was your breakfast?

18:48.409 --> 18:50.544
It's time. Lie down.

18:52.813 --> 18:54.515
I said lie down.

18:55.850 --> 18:57.953
Come on. Come on.
Chop, chop, chop.

19:04.391 --> 19:05.326
Legs up.

19:16.403 --> 19:18.439
We're gonna start
with some sit-ups.

19:21.575 --> 19:23.778
And... one.

19:24.911 --> 19:26.347
That's it.

19:27.648 --> 19:28.717
Two. Come on.

19:31.552 --> 19:33.822
Three. Oh, come on,
you can do. it.

19:37.391 --> 19:38.759
And four.

19:38.793 --> 19:42.731
No. Keep... Look... Stop.
Take a breath.

19:42.764 --> 19:47.135
- Get your lazy ass outside now.
- Leave me alone.

19:47.168 --> 19:48.803
<i>Are you ready to go again?</i>

19:48.835 --> 19:49.803
No.

19:49.836 --> 19:51.405
Yes! Go.

19:51.438 --> 19:52.907
Don't be such a lazy ass.

20:23.670 --> 20:24.805
Fuck you!

20:26.474 --> 20:27.409
Shit!

20:29.910 --> 20:31.578
Okay.

20:31.611 --> 20:33.480
I'm hoping
you've calmed down a bit.

20:33.514 --> 20:35.183
Are you ready
to give it another try?

20:39.954 --> 20:41.489
What's going on?

20:41.522 --> 20:42.457
What?

20:45.892 --> 20:48.796
- Why did you do that?
- I didn't do anything.

20:48.830 --> 20:51.064
You're allowed to touch
the box with your name,

20:51.098 --> 20:52.767
you're not allowed
to touch anything else.

20:52.800 --> 20:53.835
This is all organized.

20:57.537 --> 20:59.440
- What were you trying to do?
- Nothing.

20:59.474 --> 21:02.043
Do you think I'm happy
leaving you down here?

21:02.075 --> 21:04.178
If you'd just behave,
I wouldn't have to.

21:06.179 --> 21:08.650
Look, it's fine, fine.

21:08.682 --> 21:10.751
Let's just do five, huh?

21:10.784 --> 21:14.221
Then we can go upstairs,
we can have a nice dinner.

21:14.255 --> 21:16.457
- Really?
- Yes.

21:16.490 --> 21:18.092
But you have to do
what I want first.

21:20.727 --> 21:23.130
- Okay.
- Okay. Come on.

21:25.065 --> 21:27.201
You just needed motivation. Hmm?

21:27.235 --> 21:28.837
I'll keep that in mind.

21:31.037 --> 21:32.106
And one.

21:34.742 --> 21:35.944
And two.

21:38.778 --> 21:40.080
And three. Come on.

21:42.949 --> 21:44.486
And four.

21:47.021 --> 21:48.890
Oh, never mind.

21:48.922 --> 21:50.891
Wait. I'm trying.

21:55.095 --> 21:58.799
Come upstairs.
I made you something special.

22:34.669 --> 22:37.906
I take it by your reaction
that it's satisfactory?

22:39.140 --> 22:41.775
Have a seat. Hmm?

23:01.227 --> 23:04.832
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No.

23:04.864 --> 23:06.668
Grace.

23:11.037 --> 23:15.676
We always say grace.
Go on, Katherine.

23:18.211 --> 23:19.914
I thought you were hungry.

23:28.054 --> 23:31.258
Our father who art in heaven.

23:35.095 --> 23:41.068
Thank you for the meal.

23:41.101 --> 23:46.574
Please bless the food
that we are going to...

23:50.910 --> 23:54.881
Going to... To...

23:54.915 --> 23:58.887
I will take that.
Thank you very much.

24:00.987 --> 24:04.359
I don't understand why you are
disrespecting this food.

24:04.391 --> 24:06.794
What, you can't even say grace
properly now?

24:06.826 --> 24:08.228
What are you?
A baby?

24:08.262 --> 24:10.198
I try to do something nice,
you go ahead

24:10.230 --> 24:13.000
and destroy everything.
If you're gonna act like a baby,

24:13.034 --> 24:15.203
you can eat with that.

24:19.305 --> 24:24.011
Don't understand why we can't
have a nice dinner together.

24:24.044 --> 24:26.014
Well, go ahead and eat.

24:27.915 --> 24:29.351
Eat your salad.

24:37.257 --> 24:38.258
What are you doing?

24:40.061 --> 24:42.864
Katherine,
do not throw food on the floor.

24:42.897 --> 24:44.198
What...

24:46.867 --> 24:49.103
- Don't you dare.
- Fuck you!

24:49.136 --> 24:51.673
Hey! You can get back
to the basement.

24:51.706 --> 24:53.440
You gonna disrespect the food?
Get back to the basement.

24:53.474 --> 24:56.044
You go, go. Get out of here.
I don't wanna see you.

24:56.076 --> 24:58.111
Get out of my sight.

25:21.334 --> 25:22.937
Take off your clothes.

25:24.405 --> 25:25.774
Here.

25:28.208 --> 25:29.910
Where do you expect me
to change?

25:30.910 --> 25:32.179
In there.

25:33.781 --> 25:34.916
I'll be waiting.

25:56.336 --> 25:59.339
Hurry up.
We've got a lot to do today.

26:08.783 --> 26:12.986
Wow. You've lost more than a few
pounds since you've been gone.

26:13.019 --> 26:16.156
You're gonna be eating better
from now on.

26:16.189 --> 26:18.826
Oh, don't give me that look.
Come on, hop up.

26:21.094 --> 26:22.462
Okay.

26:22.496 --> 26:24.498
You're gonna go.

26:24.532 --> 26:26.768
You know, five-minute walk,

26:26.801 --> 26:29.437
up here to a five-minute run.

26:29.469 --> 26:31.338
I'll be back in 10 minutes.

26:59.400 --> 27:01.002
Oh.

27:01.034 --> 27:02.469
- Hey, Jeff.
- Hey.

27:02.503 --> 27:04.339
Good to see you. Come on in.

27:11.911 --> 27:13.280
So, what brings you out here?

27:13.313 --> 27:15.015
Well, you don't answer
your phone,

27:15.048 --> 27:16.850
so I had to come see you
myself.

27:16.883 --> 27:19.152
Ah. Hey, you want a cup of tea?

27:19.186 --> 27:22.590
Nah, I'm-I'm gonna go
in a minute.

27:22.622 --> 27:24.859
What do you mean?
You just got here, man.

27:24.891 --> 27:26.226
Come on. Take a seat.

27:29.196 --> 27:31.365
So how is everything?

27:31.398 --> 27:33.568
Everything
is really, really great.

27:33.601 --> 27:35.570
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

27:35.602 --> 27:37.572
Hey. Guess what?

27:37.604 --> 27:38.939
What?

27:42.008 --> 27:43.443
She's back.

27:43.476 --> 27:45.545
And she started training again.

27:45.579 --> 27:48.482
She's not in the best shape,
but we're gonna get there.

27:48.515 --> 27:50.051
- Who's back?
- Katherine.

27:52.986 --> 27:54.421
Have you stop taking the meds?

27:57.056 --> 28:00.227
Jeff, I'm fine.

28:00.261 --> 28:04.165
God, everything is great, man.
I mean, she's back.

28:04.198 --> 28:06.467
Evan. Have you stopped
taking the meds or not?

28:08.936 --> 28:10.404
Look, I'm just excited.

28:10.437 --> 28:12.305
I've been waiting for this
for this for months...

28:12.339 --> 28:14.075
- Evan, listen.
- We're gonna go for gold.

28:14.108 --> 28:15.877
- Evan, listen, okay?
- If we can reach our goal

28:15.909 --> 28:19.246
- within two months.
- Evan stop. We all love you!

28:19.280 --> 28:21.115
Okay? You know this.

28:24.651 --> 28:26.286
Why did you come out here, Jeff?

28:29.390 --> 28:30.324
Hey.

28:33.427 --> 28:35.663
And once you come all this way,
for God knows...

28:35.696 --> 28:39.634
It's been ages since you've come
out here. Why? To piss me off?

28:39.667 --> 28:41.435
- No, listen...
- Yeah, to bring me down.

28:41.467 --> 28:44.572
- I came all the way to see you.
- Just like Dad's memorial.

28:44.604 --> 28:47.440
You hugged a teenage girl out of
nowhere. What'd you expect?

28:47.474 --> 28:49.944
I expect my brother
to give me a bit of support.

28:49.976 --> 28:52.045
- I do support you, Evan.
- Oh.

28:52.079 --> 28:53.681
Will you do me a favor?
Let's just...

28:53.714 --> 28:56.250
- I'll take you to the doctor.
- I don't...

28:56.283 --> 28:58.486
- I don't need that stuff anymore.
- I can take you there now.

28:58.518 --> 29:00.121
No, I don't
have time for that.

29:00.153 --> 29:02.355
- I got Katherine, we gonna work.
- Evan.

29:02.389 --> 29:04.358
I can't do this anymore.

29:04.390 --> 29:07.294
- What do you mean?
- I'm leaving, Evan.

29:08.696 --> 29:11.064
This time for good.

29:15.703 --> 29:17.672
- I'm gonna call that doctor.
- Oh.

29:17.705 --> 29:20.942
And he better tell me
that he's seen you recently.

29:20.975 --> 29:25.513
I'll go, I promise. I-I will.

29:25.545 --> 29:27.148
Take care, okay?

29:28.247 --> 29:29.350
Yeah, yeah, sure.

29:30.583 --> 29:33.053
Hey, Jeff.

29:33.086 --> 29:35.655
Wanna say hello to Katherine?

29:35.688 --> 29:39.592
I'm tired, Evan. Get some help.

30:16.130 --> 30:18.999
Sorry I took so long.
Your uncle stopped by.

30:25.339 --> 30:28.075
Hey, I'm down here, hey.

30:28.108 --> 30:30.044
What are you doing? He's gone.

30:33.380 --> 30:36.283
Call him and tell him
to come back, please.

30:36.315 --> 30:38.785
- I wanna see my uncle.
- I know, honey.

30:38.819 --> 30:41.122
I told him you wanted to see him
but he had to go.

30:41.155 --> 30:43.257
Oh, look at you.
You're all sweaty.

30:43.290 --> 30:46.360
You were running for a long
time. I'm very proud of you.

30:46.392 --> 30:49.329
Here. Come upstairs.
We'll get you cleaned up.

31:08.681 --> 31:10.418
Here you go.
I've got your towel.

31:10.450 --> 31:12.285
What are you doing?
Get the fuck out!

31:12.319 --> 31:14.455
- All right, all right. Okay.
- Out!

31:14.487 --> 31:17.525
Keep your hair on.
Nothing I haven't seen before.

31:56.596 --> 31:58.131
In here, sweetie.

32:19.285 --> 32:20.621
Must feel good.

32:24.257 --> 32:25.258
To be home.

32:29.463 --> 32:31.265
Did you leave the water running?

32:31.297 --> 32:33.500
- Oh, I forgot.
- We can't waste water.

32:46.780 --> 32:51.185
You kind of left the room in
a bit of a mess. But you know,

32:52.753 --> 32:55.590
I think I managed to get
everything back in its place.

32:56.590 --> 32:59.427
Yeah. Thank you.

33:04.331 --> 33:06.167
Mr. Mo's been waiting for you.

33:08.569 --> 33:11.505
Oh, come on.
You remember Mr. Mo.

33:13.673 --> 33:15.608
I love you.

33:15.641 --> 33:17.210
Of course.

33:20.546 --> 33:24.817
Well, you take some time,
and I'll go make some food.

33:24.851 --> 33:26.454
Okay.

33:33.759 --> 33:34.827
Daddy.

34:52.673 --> 34:55.508
That's not gonna happen
this year.

34:55.541 --> 34:57.277
You're a champion.

34:57.311 --> 34:59.280
You're gonna get
that scholarship.

35:00.981 --> 35:03.450
I thought you might wanna
eat in the room.

35:06.419 --> 35:10.825
Hey. I'm sorry for acting
like such an idiot.

35:15.829 --> 35:17.932
I'm not proud of my behavior.
Just...

35:19.900 --> 35:23.637
I want things to go back to the
way that they were between us.

35:30.876 --> 35:32.380
I love you.

35:34.881 --> 35:36.884
I love you too, Daddy.

38:56.849 --> 38:57.817
Hey.

38:57.851 --> 38:58.852
Oh, hey.

38:58.885 --> 39:01.655
- Where were you going?
- Huh?

39:01.688 --> 39:04.525
I just wanted to see
if you needed help.

39:04.557 --> 39:05.925
You wanna help with cooking?

39:05.959 --> 39:07.027
Yeah.

39:08.662 --> 39:09.830
You hate cooking.

39:11.298 --> 39:14.066
I know, but I just figured
maybe you needed help.

39:14.099 --> 39:16.569
Say no more. Come with me.

39:28.648 --> 39:30.150
I got a job for you.

39:34.153 --> 39:37.823
Here. You cut the tomatoes.

39:40.059 --> 39:42.563
Making tea.
You want some?

39:42.595 --> 39:43.831
Sure.

39:48.767 --> 39:51.137
I thought I'd surprise you
and make your favorite.

39:51.171 --> 39:53.240
What do you think about that?

39:58.644 --> 40:00.046
Risotto. I love it.

40:01.280 --> 40:05.785
Risotto.
Since when do we have risotto?

40:05.818 --> 40:08.822
- Is that what you like now?
- No.

40:08.854 --> 40:12.325
Well, yeah.
But whatever you wanna make.

40:12.358 --> 40:15.996
I'm making spaghetti.

40:16.028 --> 40:18.599
Oh, I love spaghetti.
It's my favorite.

40:18.631 --> 40:19.967
Go ahead
and chop that tomato.

40:19.999 --> 40:21.568
- We're gonna need that.
- Okay.

40:25.204 --> 40:26.739
When did you learn
to do that?

40:26.773 --> 40:29.309
- My mom taught...
- Your mom?

40:29.342 --> 40:31.744
She was terrible
at chopping tomatoes.

40:31.778 --> 40:34.848
I didn't finish.
She taught me how not cut them.

40:34.881 --> 40:37.251
She was so bad at it.

40:41.021 --> 40:42.389
Oh, that.

40:42.421 --> 40:45.358
That's the Katherine
that I know and love.

40:45.392 --> 40:47.794
- I'm done with cooking now.
- Okay.

40:47.827 --> 40:49.095
You go off and have a rest.

40:49.128 --> 40:51.097
We're gonna have
to work out later.

40:59.039 --> 41:01.207
So where are you off to now?

41:01.240 --> 41:03.376
I was just gonna get
some fresh air.

41:03.410 --> 41:05.379
It's really hot in here.

41:05.412 --> 41:06.814
You forgot your tea.

41:08.914 --> 41:10.416
I changed my mind.

41:10.450 --> 41:12.186
You've changed a lot lately.

41:15.755 --> 41:17.289
You know...

41:17.322 --> 41:21.394
I think it may be best
for you to go to your room now.

42:05.171 --> 42:09.976
"Dear diary, my dad took away
my friend, Mr. Mo today.

42:10.008 --> 42:13.414
I miss him but dad says I need
to be a grown-up girl now."

42:21.287 --> 42:23.857
"All my family was here
for my birthday.

42:23.889 --> 42:27.159
After everyone left, my mom
started cleaning as usual.

42:27.193 --> 42:30.796
Dad and I played our game
in total darkness.

42:30.829 --> 42:32.765
He tried to chase me
around the house,

42:32.798 --> 42:34.333
but he caught me right away.

42:34.367 --> 42:37.204
He was mad at me for being
too slow and now I'm grounded."

42:38.872 --> 42:42.142
What was all that about?
You can do better than that.

42:42.175 --> 42:44.343
I mean, that was not fast.
If I can catch you,

42:44.376 --> 42:46.947
the guy in the back
can definitely catch you. Okay?

42:46.979 --> 42:50.050
I told you time and time again,
you got to stay focused.

42:50.082 --> 42:52.084
You can't get distracted.

42:52.117 --> 42:54.053
"We played hide and seek again.

42:54.086 --> 42:57.791
I love this game, but my
parents always fight afterwards.

42:57.823 --> 43:00.327
He's so bossy
and always makes me cry."

43:08.133 --> 43:11.871
I want all lights on
from now on.

43:11.905 --> 43:15.108
That's the second of my vases
you've broken in two months.

43:15.140 --> 43:16.476
Ivy, is just a vase.

43:16.508 --> 43:18.445
Don't you dare raise
your voice at me.

43:18.477 --> 43:19.912
Sorry.

43:19.945 --> 43:21.148
Here.

43:23.282 --> 43:25.818
- What you're doing is wrong.
- What is wrong?

43:28.988 --> 43:31.057
What's happened to you,
Evan?

43:31.090 --> 43:32.925
I don't know what to do anymore.

43:32.959 --> 43:35.529
I want our daughter to succeed.
Is that a crime?

43:35.561 --> 43:40.366
She's 12 years old. It's sick.
Let her enjoy her childhood.

43:40.400 --> 43:42.468
She's not just a child anymore.

43:42.501 --> 43:45.438
It is not normal at her age
to get that much exercise.

43:45.470 --> 43:48.207
- Don't you get it?
- We were just playing.

43:50.843 --> 43:52.445
It's good for her.
She loves it.

43:54.213 --> 43:56.282
Let her choose her own dreams.

43:56.316 --> 43:58.018
Not yours.

43:59.418 --> 44:02.354
You've become like your father.

44:02.387 --> 44:03.889
Oh, don't.

44:03.923 --> 44:05.425
It's the truth.

44:07.894 --> 44:09.796
She doesn't want this.

44:17.403 --> 44:20.974
Look,
am I really like my father?

44:25.110 --> 44:27.513
You can't just throw that
in my face and walk away.

44:27.546 --> 44:30.182
She's gonna thank me one day.
You're gonna see that.

44:30.215 --> 44:33.619
- She's gonna thank me.
- You need to stop this madness.

45:00.380 --> 45:01.515
"Sweet 16."

45:06.184 --> 45:07.987
- Dad?
- Uh-huh?

45:08.021 --> 45:10.923
- I'm gonna go out tonight.
- Mm? What's that?

45:10.956 --> 45:12.358
What? Oh, no you're not.

45:12.392 --> 45:14.394
It's your birthday.
It's time for family, hon.

45:14.427 --> 45:18.131
Yeah, but dad I-I'm 16,
I wanna go out.

45:18.164 --> 45:20.534
- Who with?
- Does it matter?

45:23.336 --> 45:26.206
- Um, with Jared.
- No.

45:26.238 --> 45:28.073
Dad, please don't do this.

45:28.106 --> 45:30.643
I promise I'll come home early
and spend time with you.

45:30.677 --> 45:32.646
You heard what I said,
don't make me say it again.

45:32.678 --> 45:35.014
- Daddy, I'm begging you.
- Look, your Uncle Jeff

45:35.048 --> 45:37.284
is gonna be here in two hours,
then have a lovely dinner

45:37.316 --> 45:39.418
your mother's worked
really hard to make.

45:39.452 --> 45:41.121
We're gonna play some games.

45:41.153 --> 45:43.489
Besides,
you've got to get to bed early.

45:43.523 --> 45:45.557
You got that five-mile run
in the morning.

45:45.590 --> 45:46.525
Mom!

45:59.405 --> 46:01.608
Hello? Hey, Jeff.

46:03.608 --> 46:06.979
Look, Jeff.
I'm gonna go, okay?

46:07.012 --> 46:09.916
It doesn't help
just having you nag me, okay?

46:11.617 --> 46:16.189
Yes, yes, anything
that makes you happy, okay?

46:16.222 --> 46:19.325
Yeah, okay.
Au revoir to you too.

46:20.693 --> 46:23.229
Katherine,
food's ready in 10 minutes.

46:25.030 --> 46:26.400
Okay, Daddy.

46:30.503 --> 46:32.539
"Today, I got my period again.

46:32.572 --> 46:35.108
Dad doesn't handle this well,

46:35.140 --> 46:37.177
every single time.

46:37.209 --> 46:39.211
He's so awkward
with the whole situation.

46:40.445 --> 46:42.414
Food's ready.

46:42.447 --> 46:44.150
Oh, no.

46:44.182 --> 46:47.086
Uncle Jeff's driving me bananas.

46:51.657 --> 46:54.760
Hello. Oh, hi there, Jeff.

46:54.793 --> 46:56.395
Nice to hear from you again.

46:56.428 --> 46:59.331
Look, look, Jeff, okay,
everything is fine over here.

46:59.365 --> 47:04.204
Could you just...
Would you please stop calling.

47:10.575 --> 47:12.211
I'm serving dinner.
Come on.

47:12.244 --> 47:15.448
Daddy,
I just started my period.

47:18.184 --> 47:23.723
Ah... Oh, uh,
but your dinner's ready.

47:23.756 --> 47:26.292
- I need some pads.
- Oh, okay.

47:26.325 --> 47:28.128
Can you just
use something else?

47:28.160 --> 47:30.229
I don't wanna drive
to town again...

47:30.262 --> 47:31.697
I need some pads right now.

47:31.731 --> 47:33.466
But I don't want to drive,
though.

47:33.499 --> 47:35.068
- Daddy!
- Okay, look.

47:35.101 --> 47:37.137
I'm sorry, look,
I'm sorry, please.

47:37.169 --> 47:39.039
Okay, please, don't cry,
don't cry.

47:39.072 --> 47:40.106
I'll go.

47:41.206 --> 47:43.042
I'll be like an hour.

47:53.686 --> 47:57.256
Hey, hon, I think
it would be a really good idea

47:57.289 --> 47:59.391
if you went to the basement
and trained while I was gone.

47:59.425 --> 48:02.461
- No, please, can I stay here?
- No, Katherine.

48:02.494 --> 48:04.830
I really want you to go
to the basement and train.

48:04.863 --> 48:08.534
You can either go nicely
or I can take you down there.

48:08.568 --> 48:09.636
Fine.

48:11.137 --> 48:13.606
Just let me
grab something first.

48:13.639 --> 48:15.407
What do you got there?

48:15.441 --> 48:17.611
It's just my diary. Jeez.

48:38.231 --> 48:40.233
- <i>Hey mom.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

48:40.265 --> 48:41.767
<i>How did you meet Dad?</i>

48:45.238 --> 48:47.340
Oh, you're taking me
way back now.

48:47.372 --> 48:49.342
I thought your dad
already told you.

48:49.374 --> 48:52.079
Yeah, but I want to hear
your version.

48:53.579 --> 48:57.851
Well, we were working
at the same school together,

48:57.883 --> 49:01.220
and we kind of liked each other.

49:01.253 --> 49:05.124
It took your dad
two semesters to ask me out.

49:06.892 --> 49:11.530
You can't tell by looking at
him now, but he used to be shy.

49:11.564 --> 49:14.367
- No way.
- Yeah.

49:14.400 --> 49:17.137
I still remember
when he asked me out.

49:17.169 --> 49:21.240
His hand were shaking,
his face was all red,

49:21.273 --> 49:25.611
sweating all over
this horrible brown shirt.

49:30.448 --> 49:31.517
You're set, honey.

49:32.818 --> 49:34.321
You're gorgeous.

49:35.454 --> 49:37.590
Jared's gonna lose it tonight.

49:41.293 --> 49:44.263
- He's home early.
- It's okay.

49:44.296 --> 49:45.664
Just let me do the talking.

49:45.697 --> 49:48.500
<i>He must been speeding, again.</i>

49:50.570 --> 49:51.705
Shit.

50:25.671 --> 50:28.675
Hello, good sir.
The name is Neil.

50:28.707 --> 50:31.510
Sorry to bother you,
but do you have a minute?

50:32.912 --> 50:34.847
What do you need?

50:34.880 --> 50:36.950
Have you seen my girlfriend?

50:43.923 --> 50:45.258
Have you seen her?

50:45.291 --> 50:46.825
She's lost.

50:50.729 --> 50:52.398
- Is this a joke?
- Excuse me?

50:52.430 --> 50:53.733
Do you think this is funny?

50:53.765 --> 50:55.668
- I don't understand.
- What was your name?

50:55.700 --> 50:57.570
- Neil.
- Neil.

50:57.602 --> 51:00.340
Let me get this straight, Neil.
You're coming on my property,

51:00.372 --> 51:01.807
you tell me the girl
in this picture

51:01.840 --> 51:03.375
she's your girlfriend
and she's missing.

51:03.409 --> 51:05.345
That's right, sir.

51:05.378 --> 51:06.512
Who put you up to this?

51:06.544 --> 51:07.813
I'm just here to...

51:07.847 --> 51:09.950
It's Jeff!
Jeff put you up to this.

51:11.483 --> 51:12.851
Excuse me?

51:12.885 --> 51:14.821
I want you to get off
of my property

51:14.854 --> 51:16.756
and not come back.

51:16.789 --> 51:19.258
- Can I...
- Am I making myself clear?

51:19.291 --> 51:21.927
- Can I get my picture back...
- You're on a private property.

51:21.961 --> 51:23.396
Want me
to call the cops?

51:23.428 --> 51:24.796
Sir, I just want
the picture back...

51:24.829 --> 51:27.032
No, I want you out of here.

51:27.066 --> 51:28.602
It's your final warning.

51:30.436 --> 51:32.972
Okay, jeez, psycho.

51:34.039 --> 51:35.775
I'm not gonna say it again.

51:39.979 --> 51:41.581
Drive safe.

52:08.374 --> 52:11.778
<i>"Dad got mad at me
again for no apparent reason.</i>

52:11.811 --> 52:13.845
It always happens randomly.

52:13.878 --> 52:15.447
One second he's calm,

52:15.481 --> 52:17.917
and the next,
he becomes a different person.

52:17.950 --> 52:19.452
A beast.

52:19.485 --> 52:21.521
You can't escape from a beast.

52:21.553 --> 52:24.057
He needs help. I need help.

52:24.090 --> 52:25.591
I miss mom."

52:39.003 --> 52:40.772
Sorry, I'm late back.

52:40.805 --> 52:44.910
I, uh... I got your... You know.

52:44.943 --> 52:48.314
Uncle Jeff wouldn't stop nagging
me about going to the doctor.

52:50.749 --> 52:53.352
So I...

52:53.385 --> 52:57.823
I called in while I was out,
uh, picked up some meds.

53:04.396 --> 53:07.733
Oh, look, it's nothing,
it's just, uh...

53:07.767 --> 53:10.370
When you left I was, uh,

53:10.403 --> 53:12.372
seeing him for a bit just,
you know,

53:12.405 --> 53:15.006
to help with my anger
and my anxiety and stuff.

53:15.039 --> 53:17.710
Hey, don't worry,
I'm working on my nerves.

53:20.479 --> 53:22.115
You want me to stay here?

53:22.148 --> 53:23.749
I was gonna fix dinner.

53:23.782 --> 53:26.017
I'm gonna go to my room.

53:28.854 --> 53:32.558
I promised myself
I wasn't gonna ask say this.

53:32.590 --> 53:35.594
During this little break
you had,

53:35.628 --> 53:36.863
where were you?

53:39.597 --> 53:42.034
- Who were you with?
- What do you mean?

53:42.066 --> 53:43.635
You know exactly what I mean.

53:43.668 --> 53:46.438
I was with my boyfriend.
Jared.

53:49.974 --> 53:52.644
You were with Jared.

53:52.677 --> 53:54.613
Yeah, why?

53:55.847 --> 53:57.416
No reason.

53:57.450 --> 53:58.585
Wait.

53:59.952 --> 54:01.988
Since we're here,
let's check your height.

54:02.021 --> 54:03.756
See if you've grown any taller.

54:03.789 --> 54:05.191
- I'm not feeling well.
- Come on.

54:05.224 --> 54:06.459
We're gonna get
your measurements.

54:06.492 --> 54:07.593
Up against the wall.

54:07.626 --> 54:09.662
Come on.

54:09.695 --> 54:12.097
Up straight, up straight.

54:12.131 --> 54:15.768
Keep your head up.
I don't wanna make a mistake.

54:15.800 --> 54:17.836
All right. Step aside.

54:19.104 --> 54:20.540
No, that can't be right.

54:20.572 --> 54:21.840
What are you? Hunchbacked?

54:21.874 --> 54:23.109
Come on, try again.

54:23.142 --> 54:24.744
Put your back against the wall.

54:28.213 --> 54:29.181
Here.

54:32.584 --> 54:33.952
That's better.

54:33.985 --> 54:36.188
Looks like we've got
to strengthen your back.

54:36.222 --> 54:37.823
Come on. We'll get your weight.

54:40.159 --> 54:41.193
Hop up.

54:43.628 --> 54:45.097
A hundred pounds?

54:48.566 --> 54:53.238
You've lost 20 pounds. Oh.
Oh, cool, no don't worry.

54:53.271 --> 54:56.141
God. It's not a problem, you
know, nothing to worry about.

54:56.175 --> 54:57.209
Keep your cool.

55:01.247 --> 55:02.582
Here.

55:02.615 --> 55:05.685
- How many?
- I don't know how many.

55:05.718 --> 55:09.822
Years of preparation
just went to hell. Jesus.

55:09.854 --> 55:12.157
- You don't have any respect.
- Sorry.

55:12.191 --> 55:14.593
Just do it till I say stop,
come on.

55:17.530 --> 55:18.798
Did I say stop?

55:18.831 --> 55:20.932
I don't even know why I bother.

55:20.965 --> 55:23.134
It's just
a complete waste of time...

55:23.168 --> 55:24.503
Ow!

55:29.207 --> 55:30.142
Psycho.

55:47.191 --> 55:48.594
Katherine!

55:54.166 --> 55:55.802
Give me the keys.

55:58.202 --> 56:00.739
I said give me the fucking keys.

56:07.947 --> 56:10.115
How could you do that?

56:11.916 --> 56:14.619
How could you do that
to your own father?

56:14.653 --> 56:18.658
How could you do that?
Your own father.

56:20.858 --> 56:23.996
How could you do that
to someone who loves you?

56:46.385 --> 56:48.955
"First day at the hospital."

56:48.988 --> 56:50.923
Oh, no.

56:54.959 --> 56:56.795
Your dinner is on the table.

58:26.952 --> 58:27.887
I'm sorry.

58:36.794 --> 58:37.729
Daddy.

58:40.465 --> 58:42.868
Can you say the prayer tonight?

58:46.137 --> 58:47.340
Sure.

58:50.309 --> 58:52.244
Bless us, oh lord,
for these, thy gifts,

58:52.276 --> 58:56.247
which we are about to receive
from thy bounty, though Christ.

58:56.280 --> 58:58.249
Bless us, oh lord,
for these, thy gifts,

58:58.282 --> 59:00.085
which we are about to receive
from the bounty,

59:00.119 --> 59:01.421
through Christ, our lord.

59:06.492 --> 59:09.195
Thank you for bringing
my daughter back to me.

59:12.530 --> 59:14.467
I promise to love her
with all my heart,

59:14.499 --> 59:17.135
no matter what she does.

59:17.168 --> 59:20.038
Everything I have is hers.

59:20.072 --> 59:24.175
Please, just give me
the patience,

59:24.209 --> 59:26.011
to help her achieve her dreams,

59:26.043 --> 59:30.115
without losing my cool
like a complete freakin' idiot.

59:30.148 --> 59:31.316
Amen.

59:37.822 --> 59:39.257
Well, go ahead. Just...

59:39.291 --> 59:41.160
Eat your dinner.

59:55.072 --> 59:56.174
Dad?

59:57.209 --> 59:58.511
Yes, sweetie.

59:58.543 --> 1:00:01.112
The schools are gonna open
again soon.

1:00:01.146 --> 1:00:02.414
When do you have to go back?

1:00:04.515 --> 1:00:05.885
I've retired, hon.

1:00:08.253 --> 1:00:11.758
I retired after you left.
I just... I...

1:00:15.526 --> 1:00:17.530
So, what about me?

1:00:17.563 --> 1:00:21.901
Well, your Uncle Jeff.
He said it was better

1:00:21.934 --> 1:00:25.004
that I stay out here,
so I'm gonna be teaching you.

1:00:26.604 --> 1:00:29.440
You're gonna be doing
some homeschooling.

1:00:44.222 --> 1:00:47.992
You know, they-they named
the library after your mother.

1:00:48.026 --> 1:00:51.097
- Oh, I didn't know that.
- You should have been there.

1:00:53.564 --> 1:00:55.601
If you haven't blamed me
and just run off.

1:00:55.633 --> 1:00:59.070
- I don't blame you. That's not...
- You know, don't. Don't.

1:00:59.104 --> 1:01:00.306
- I'm not.
- Just...

1:01:02.340 --> 1:01:05.577
Finish your dinner
then wash the dishes.

1:01:25.363 --> 1:01:26.865
Dad?

1:01:28.133 --> 1:01:29.435
Yeah?

1:01:29.468 --> 1:01:31.270
Could we have some music?

1:01:31.302 --> 1:01:33.538
It's really quiet in here.

1:01:33.572 --> 1:01:36.041
You wanna hear your lullaby?

1:01:36.073 --> 1:01:37.242
Sure.

1:01:52.291 --> 1:01:53.426
What the hell?

1:02:02.300 --> 1:02:04.003
Hey, you know
what I was thinking?

1:02:04.035 --> 1:02:05.470
What?

1:02:05.503 --> 1:02:08.973
We haven't play our little game
for a long time.

1:02:09.006 --> 1:02:11.175
How about we have
a bit of fun?

1:02:11.209 --> 1:02:12.278
Yeah.

1:02:17.515 --> 1:02:18.483
Ready?

1:02:42.340 --> 1:02:43.608
Here comes Daddy.

1:02:45.010 --> 1:02:47.278
- Ow!
- What? What?

1:02:47.311 --> 1:02:50.014
- Are you okay? Are you okay?
- It's my ankle.

1:02:50.048 --> 1:02:52.351
Come on. Up. Up. Oh, I got you.

1:02:52.383 --> 1:02:56.155
I got you. Keep it still.
Here we go. Here we go.

1:04:00.385 --> 1:04:02.488
Come on.
We're getting out of here.

1:04:02.521 --> 1:04:04.156
Watch your ankle.

1:04:17.068 --> 1:04:20.271
- Is it over?
- Yeah, I think so.

1:04:20.305 --> 1:04:22.207
Okay, come on, let's go in.

1:04:22.240 --> 1:04:24.209
- I can walk.
- Okay.

1:04:33.084 --> 1:04:34.352
Katherine?

1:04:35.720 --> 1:04:38.124
I wanna stay out here
a little longer.

1:04:40.492 --> 1:04:43.195
It will be a mess inside.

1:04:43.227 --> 1:04:45.463
I need you to help me
clean it up.

1:04:47.666 --> 1:04:49.168
Okay.

1:05:09.720 --> 1:05:12.657
Oh, no. Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'll take that.

1:05:14.693 --> 1:05:16.428
Your mom made that.

1:05:16.461 --> 1:05:19.765
- Oh, I-I forgot.
- Yeah. Better get it fixed up.

1:05:25.336 --> 1:05:26.604
It's the photo damaged?

1:05:26.637 --> 1:05:28.706
No. The glass is broken, though.

1:05:30.775 --> 1:05:32.311
That was my last race.

1:05:33.611 --> 1:05:36.247
Now, that is not
gonna happen to you.

1:05:37.414 --> 1:05:39.351
Your father cares.

1:05:39.383 --> 1:05:41.419
You are gonna win.

1:05:50.427 --> 1:05:52.864
Well, about time.
How you feeling?

1:05:52.898 --> 1:05:54.466
- Good. Yeah.
- Yeah? Feeling good?

1:05:54.499 --> 1:05:56.135
- Feeling strong?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

1:05:56.168 --> 1:05:57.803
Let's go, girl. Go.

1:06:03.307 --> 1:06:05.443
Three laps around the lines. Go!

1:06:09.947 --> 1:06:13.218
See if you can beat my record
any time soon, hon.

1:06:15.653 --> 1:06:17.389
No, Katherine.
Eyes straight ahead.

1:06:17.421 --> 1:06:19.257
Don't get distracted.

1:06:19.291 --> 1:06:20.758
That's it girl. That's it!

1:06:24.195 --> 1:06:27.498
Come on. Put the pace on.
Keep the pace up.

1:06:27.532 --> 1:06:30.702
Keep the pace up.
One more lap. Come on.

1:06:33.505 --> 1:06:34.840
No, wait, wait, Katherine.

1:06:34.872 --> 1:06:37.575
No, Katherine.

1:06:41.445 --> 1:06:44.516
Katherine. Katherine.

1:06:46.684 --> 1:06:48.320
Please, no, don't leave.

1:06:48.352 --> 1:06:49.521
Don't leave.

1:06:50.722 --> 1:06:53.592
My ankle. My ankle.

1:06:53.624 --> 1:06:58.164
What? What? Oh, no.
Oh, no. Oh, no.

1:07:11.409 --> 1:07:14.746
Careful. Okay.

1:07:14.778 --> 1:07:16.581
Can we eat it?

1:07:16.615 --> 1:07:17.783
- Yep.
- Great.

1:07:37.735 --> 1:07:38.770
Okay.

1:07:42.340 --> 1:07:46.345
Seventy-one, 72, 73...

1:08:20.711 --> 1:08:24.015
Whoa, whoa, no, whoa, whoa. Oh.

1:08:25.950 --> 1:08:27.686
You're not ready.

1:08:27.719 --> 1:08:29.755
Am I not ready or is it you?

1:08:29.787 --> 1:08:32.424
Switch around. Come on.

1:09:01.753 --> 1:09:04.322
Come on, you must've
finished your homework by now.

1:09:04.356 --> 1:09:06.090
- Your dinner's getting cold.
- I did. Okay.

1:09:06.124 --> 1:09:07.860
Come on, grab the plates.

1:09:14.631 --> 1:09:17.469
I know somebody who's gonna have
a birthday soon.

1:09:19.437 --> 1:09:21.773
- Oh, right.
- What?

1:09:21.805 --> 1:09:24.643
Oh, you did not forget
your birthday, did you?

1:09:24.675 --> 1:09:26.777
Just for a second,
I remember now.

1:09:28.545 --> 1:09:30.682
Better start thinking
about what you want.

1:09:32.750 --> 1:09:34.352
Anything you like. Name it.

1:09:34.385 --> 1:09:36.388
You know exactly what I want,
Dad.

1:09:36.420 --> 1:09:41.058
I just wanted to say how very,
very proud I am of you.

1:09:41.092 --> 1:09:43.762
It's true. I, uh...

1:09:43.795 --> 1:09:47.032
you worked towards your goals
with determination, commitment,

1:09:47.064 --> 1:09:49.934
and you've got out of your
comfort zone every single day...

1:09:49.968 --> 1:09:51.670
- Would you stop it already?
- Why?

1:09:51.702 --> 1:09:53.571
I just want to say
what I really feel.

1:09:53.604 --> 1:09:55.072
We did it together, Dad.

1:09:55.106 --> 1:09:57.742
If it weren't for you,
I wouldn't come this far.

1:09:57.776 --> 1:09:59.411
- So you're feeling ready?
- Yeah.

1:09:59.443 --> 1:10:02.747
Hey, that's good, 'cause
I've entered you in a race.

1:10:02.781 --> 1:10:06.651
- What?
- Oh, yeah.

1:10:06.683 --> 1:10:10.688
You're gonna be running
in seven weeks.

1:10:10.722 --> 1:10:13.791
- I'm running in seven weeks?
- You sure are.

1:10:19.597 --> 1:10:20.999
Thanks, Dad.

1:10:21.031 --> 1:10:23.467
I waited for such a long time.
That's it!

1:10:23.500 --> 1:10:25.169
- What's it?
- The best present.

1:10:25.202 --> 1:10:28.139
- Oh.
- You forgot the tomatoes.

1:10:51.528 --> 1:10:54.665
That, uh, bird
was driving me nuts.

1:10:56.867 --> 1:10:58.003
- Here, get in.
- What?

1:10:58.036 --> 1:10:59.871
Oh, no. Don't.
You don't want that.

1:10:59.903 --> 1:11:03.107
- I wanna remember the moment.
- I'm terrible at selfies.

1:11:18.589 --> 1:11:19.924
I love you, Dad.

1:11:21.159 --> 1:11:22.994
I love you more.

1:11:23.027 --> 1:11:24.763
Hey, come on. Let's eat.

1:11:27.499 --> 1:11:28.934
We have to pray first.

1:11:30.802 --> 1:11:32.737
Bless us, oh lord,
for these, thy gifts,

1:11:32.769 --> 1:11:34.872
which we're about to receive
from thy bounty

1:11:34.906 --> 1:11:37.642
through Christ,
our Lord. Amen.

1:11:37.674 --> 1:11:40.177
And 98, come on.

1:11:40.210 --> 1:11:42.780
Here she comes, 99.

1:11:42.813 --> 1:11:46.684
Here we go, ladies and gentlemen
and it's a hundred.

1:11:46.718 --> 1:11:48.787
Ladies and gentlemen,
she did a hundred.

1:11:48.820 --> 1:11:49.987
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yeah!

1:11:50.021 --> 1:11:52.256
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1:11:52.290 --> 1:11:55.660
You. I am so proud of you,
you're amazing.

1:11:55.692 --> 1:11:57.495
Come on. Up here. Let's go.

1:11:57.528 --> 1:12:01.499
Stand up straight,
stand up straight. Here we go.

1:12:01.532 --> 1:12:02.767
And...

1:12:04.302 --> 1:12:07.938
She's getting bigger.
Come on, moment of truth.

1:12:07.972 --> 1:12:10.942
Here we go. Up you get. Come on.

1:12:10.974 --> 1:12:12.677
You get.

1:12:12.710 --> 1:12:13.912
Don't look. Don't look!

1:12:15.647 --> 1:12:17.015
- Oh, no.
- What?

1:12:17.048 --> 1:12:18.517
It's freaking perfect.

1:12:18.549 --> 1:12:20.619
- It is freaking perfect!
- Whoo!

I know.

1:13:49.206 --> 1:13:51.108
You look just like her.

1:14:57.942 --> 1:15:00.211
Hey, honeybun.
Didn't know you were up.

1:15:00.244 --> 1:15:02.313
- I'm gonna go for a run.
- Oh, no, you're not.

1:15:02.345 --> 1:15:03.714
This is your special day.

1:15:03.747 --> 1:15:05.316
But the race
is in a couple of days.

1:15:05.348 --> 1:15:08.786
Oh, yes. And today is Sunday
and Sunday is...

1:15:08.820 --> 1:15:10.688
- A day of rest.
- That's right.

1:15:12.022 --> 1:15:13.290
Close your eyes.

1:15:23.267 --> 1:15:24.936
Open.

1:15:24.969 --> 1:15:26.271
Happy birthday.

1:15:26.304 --> 1:15:28.440
- Is this...?
- It is.

1:15:28.473 --> 1:15:31.242
- Thanks, Dad.
- Ah! Forgetting something?

1:15:31.275 --> 1:15:32.811
Hm-mm.

1:15:34.879 --> 1:15:37.349
Gotcha. Off you go.

1:15:41.352 --> 1:15:43.254
I'm gonna be heading out
for a while.

1:15:43.286 --> 1:15:45.189
No birthday without cake.

1:17:37.268 --> 1:17:38.537
What are you doing out here?

1:17:39.937 --> 1:17:41.173
Hi, dad.

1:17:43.406 --> 1:17:45.375
Well, don't just stand there.

1:17:45.409 --> 1:17:49.380
Get over here. Give your old
man a hand, huh? Come on.

1:17:54.986 --> 1:17:59.256
Here. You take that one.
And you take that one.

1:18:00.390 --> 1:18:02.027
I'll take this one.

1:18:04.562 --> 1:18:06.064
Oh!

1:18:07.497 --> 1:18:09.433
Come on. Come inside.

1:18:11.969 --> 1:18:13.238
Come on.

1:18:29.687 --> 1:18:31.590
Dad? Are you okay?

1:18:34.191 --> 1:18:37.562
Better get that ice cream
in the freezer before it melts.

1:18:37.594 --> 1:18:40.497
I got your favorite.
Chocolate fudge sundae.

1:18:40.531 --> 1:18:42.433
Oh, yeah, I know.
There goes the diet.

1:18:42.465 --> 1:18:44.302
But hey, it's only once a year.

1:18:53.344 --> 1:18:55.013
What are you doing?

1:18:55.045 --> 1:18:57.682
No, I don't want you in here
while I'm setting up.

1:18:57.714 --> 1:19:00.951
You go to your room.
This could take a while.

1:19:00.985 --> 1:19:02.653
How'd you know I'd be here?

1:19:02.687 --> 1:19:05.089
You are going to spoil
the surprise.

1:19:05.121 --> 1:19:07.325
Go to your room. Go on,
quick, quick, go, go!

1:19:07.357 --> 1:19:09.326
That's it?
Go to your room?

1:19:09.360 --> 1:19:11.496
How about I miss you,
I love you, I hate you,

1:19:11.528 --> 1:19:13.231
where the hell have you been?

1:19:13.263 --> 1:19:16.668
Of course I love you. What the
hell kind of question is that?

1:19:20.271 --> 1:19:22.506
Are you on your period?

1:19:22.540 --> 1:19:24.142
I don't understand.

1:19:24.174 --> 1:19:27.177
Just go to your room, please?
Go on. Do some homework.

1:19:27.210 --> 1:19:29.179
- Homework? I don't have homework.
- Just go.

1:19:29.213 --> 1:19:30.447
Okay, I'm going.

1:19:56.107 --> 1:19:57.542
Hey. Heh-heh.

1:20:53.531 --> 1:20:55.566
I love your handwriting.

1:20:55.598 --> 1:20:57.001
Who are you?

1:21:04.842 --> 1:21:06.811
Did you read my diary?

1:21:06.844 --> 1:21:09.113
Yes. To study you.

1:21:09.146 --> 1:21:10.782
I've admired you
for a long time.

1:21:10.814 --> 1:21:12.517
What?

1:21:12.549 --> 1:21:14.619
I never thought
I'd meet you in person.

1:21:14.652 --> 1:21:17.188
All right, enough.

1:21:17.220 --> 1:21:21.558
It's funny. Your voice
is just like I imagined it.

1:21:22.826 --> 1:21:25.729
- Happy birthday, by the way.
- Thanks.

1:21:25.763 --> 1:21:27.799
How does it feel
to finally be an adult?

1:21:29.265 --> 1:21:31.702
Free? Independent?

1:21:33.437 --> 1:21:36.107
Must not have liked it much,
or you wouldn't be back.

1:21:36.139 --> 1:21:39.343
Enough about me.
I want to know who you are.

1:21:42.580 --> 1:21:45.316
I'm you, a year younger.

1:21:46.450 --> 1:21:48.352
Excuse me?

1:21:48.384 --> 1:21:50.454
I live here now.

1:21:50.487 --> 1:21:54.726
I sleep in your bed, eat
your food, wear your clothes.

1:21:57.428 --> 1:21:59.697
I chose this dress for tonight.

1:22:01.298 --> 1:22:02.233
What do you think?

1:22:06.336 --> 1:22:08.072
Dad likes it on me.

1:22:09.772 --> 1:22:12.110
He says green is my color.

1:22:22.286 --> 1:22:25.456
I broke your record
for the mile, by the way.

1:22:25.488 --> 1:22:27.258
I finally made Dad proud.

1:22:27.290 --> 1:22:31.128
Dad? Why do you keep calling
my dad that? What's going on?

1:22:31.161 --> 1:22:33.865
You see, I'm not afraid
of anything anymore.

1:22:35.499 --> 1:22:37.300
It's because
I'm finally happy now.

1:22:37.334 --> 1:22:40.871
- You're starting to freak me out.
- I know. You're scared.

1:22:43.640 --> 1:22:45.710
- I was scared too.
- Please stay there.

1:22:46.744 --> 1:22:48.478
You don't get it, do you?

1:22:51.281 --> 1:22:54.184
I don't know what you want.
I just came here to see my dad.

1:22:54.218 --> 1:22:55.920
I'm not looking
for any trouble.

1:22:55.952 --> 1:22:58.688
He needed help
after the accident.

1:22:58.722 --> 1:23:00.457
Even if he was
speeding that night,

1:23:00.491 --> 1:23:02.360
you could have supported him.

1:23:02.393 --> 1:23:04.162
He didn't do it on purpose.

1:23:04.195 --> 1:23:08.866
Oh, look at her.

1:23:08.898 --> 1:23:11.468
She's crying.

1:23:11.501 --> 1:23:14.839
What a poor little bitch!

1:23:16.307 --> 1:23:18.409
He loves you.

1:23:20.510 --> 1:23:22.312
You have no idea
how it really feels

1:23:22.345 --> 1:23:24.348
to have a monster
type of a father.

1:23:24.380 --> 1:23:25.349
A beast!

1:23:29.719 --> 1:23:31.421
I can't go back.

1:23:36.259 --> 1:23:37.195
I'm sorry.

1:23:51.875 --> 1:23:53.911
Everything okay in
there, sweetheart?

1:23:53.943 --> 1:23:56.479
Everything's fine, Daddy.

1:23:56.513 --> 1:23:59.417
Don't keep me waiting.

1:23:59.450 --> 1:24:00.617

Can we go for a drive?

1:24:47.997 --> 1:24:50.335
Yeah, sure. Of course we can.

1:24:52.870 --> 1:24:53.871
I'm driving.

1:24:55.673 --> 1:25:00.812
Sure and I'll just get my wallet
and I'll see you in the car.

1:25:59.103 --> 1:26:02.340
- Be careful.
- Always.
