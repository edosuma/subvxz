<i>...the accountants who look after Ireland
don't see forest like that at all.</i>

03:00.455 --> 03:04.318
<i>And subsequently Greece isn't the only
member of the Poor Eurozone club</i>

03:04.418 --> 03:07.796
<i>to consider selling off bits of
its environment to make some money.</i>

03:07.921 --> 03:10.924
<i>But this would leave Ireland
as the only country in the developed world</i>

03:11.049 --> 03:13.260
<i>without a publicly-owned forest.</i>

03:13.385 --> 03:15.929
<i>And it isn't even as though
it's going to get rich out of it.</i>

03:16.054 --> 03:20.976
<i>Hence the backlash we experienced today
at the Free Our Trees rally.</i>

03:21.435 --> 03:25.230
<i>Those parasites can show up and try
but I'll tell you one thing for sure</i>

03:25.355 --> 03:29.234
<i>over our dead bodies
will they take our trees from us!</i>

03:34.531 --> 03:35.849
Yeah.

03:35.949 --> 03:39.328
There's enough trees to keep Daddy
busy until you're all grown up.

03:42.247 --> 03:44.082
I know.

03:44.207 --> 03:46.209
I like it, too.

04:17.908 --> 04:20.911
A lot of them are gonna have
to come down, Finn.

04:21.244 --> 04:22.980
Yeah.

04:23.080 --> 04:25.040
It's sad.

04:31.880 --> 04:35.425
Alright. Let's get you back to Mom.

04:37.135 --> 04:38.804
Iggy!

05:04.287 --> 05:06.081
Iggy!

05:08.709 --> 05:11.069
Hey, come on, Finnball.

05:11.169 --> 05:13.338
Let's go and find Iggy.

05:14.840 --> 05:16.591
Iggy!

05:28.103 --> 05:29.771
Iggy!

05:30.939 --> 05:32.733
Iggy!

05:34.026 --> 05:35.736
Yeah.

05:44.286 --> 05:46.538
What do you think of that, Finn?

05:54.546 --> 05:56.256
Hey.

06:17.527 --> 06:19.404
What's going on?

07:00.946 --> 07:02.364
Don't tell Mom.

08:00.547 --> 08:02.424
Shit!

08:14.603 --> 08:17.856
I'm sorry, Mr. Donnelly. He's not here.

08:22.319 --> 08:24.696
You can come in and wait if you like.

08:25.906 --> 08:28.408
He's in the forest again, is he?

08:36.541 --> 08:39.586
- He's trespassing.
- It's his job, Mr. Donnelly.

08:39.711 --> 08:43.256
It's dangerous for him...
and the little one.

08:49.971 --> 08:53.642
I'm sorry. I'll make sure my husband
stops by your farm first thing tomorrow.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.310
Tonight.

08:55.435 --> 08:58.021
He comes to see me tonight.

09:28.010 --> 09:31.496
- Christ! When did you get home?
- Just got in. Can you take Finn?

09:31.596 --> 09:35.292
- Colm is out there. Go talk to him.
- No, not today.

09:35.392 --> 09:38.879
Why? Adam, please just go,
buy him a pint and hear him out.

09:38.979 --> 09:40.797
Tried that. Still not mates.

09:40.897 --> 09:44.109
That's the third time since we moved here.
He's creeping me out.

09:44.234 --> 09:45.902
Look, they're just words.

09:46.028 --> 09:49.614
He's just not happy they're selling
the forest, neither am I.

09:50.657 --> 09:52.993
But I have work to do
and he's gonna have to deal with it.

09:53.118 --> 09:57.122
- I can't not do my job, now, can I?
- Please, just talk to him.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.210
Okay.

10:21.355 --> 10:23.482
What did you find, Iggs?

10:31.114 --> 10:34.993
Come on, darling. Come on. Hey.

12:01.788 --> 12:03.457
Adam?

12:03.957 --> 12:07.002
Adam! The roof's falling in.

12:07.127 --> 12:08.837
Literally?

12:08.962 --> 12:12.382
Yes, Adam. Five hundred years
of ancient Irish sludge

12:12.507 --> 12:14.843
are dripping all over Finn's bed.

12:17.596 --> 12:19.164
I'll move the cot.

12:19.264 --> 12:21.641
Can you check the attic, please?

13:27.958 --> 13:30.210
Didn't find anything.

13:31.336 --> 13:33.005
Everything's okay.

13:33.380 --> 13:37.300
Probably just damp. It's an old place.

13:38.468 --> 13:41.638
- Are you missing London?
- Oh, God, no.

13:43.223 --> 13:45.100
Me neither.

13:47.978 --> 13:50.897
Wine. Wine.

13:51.857 --> 13:54.067
It's like camping.

14:08.874 --> 14:11.335
Have I ever shown you a cordycep?

14:11.460 --> 14:13.003
Probably.

14:13.128 --> 14:16.365
You show me lots of weird shit
when you smoke weed.

14:16.465 --> 14:20.177
It's the Trojan Horse of parasitic fungi.

14:21.011 --> 14:23.055
Come see this.

14:24.556 --> 14:26.391
This little beauty.

14:26.516 --> 14:30.395
Its spores can penetrate
the skull of an ant...

14:30.520 --> 14:32.814
take control of its mind.

14:33.523 --> 14:35.776
That's disgusting.

14:35.901 --> 14:37.844
It's amazing.

14:37.944 --> 14:42.574
It gets inside the nest, drops its spores
over the entire colony...

14:43.200 --> 14:46.186
creating thousands of little...

14:46.286 --> 14:48.121
fungus...

14:49.623 --> 14:52.959
controlled automatons.

14:53.085 --> 14:55.379
You're so high.

14:56.880 --> 14:59.007
Not when I found it.

15:02.344 --> 15:04.204
I wasn't.

15:04.304 --> 15:08.709
- I was with Finn.
- Fine, fine, Doctor Attenborough.

15:08.809 --> 15:11.645
Just don't go bringing
any of those in here.

15:14.272 --> 15:16.483
Of course you did.

15:27.411 --> 15:30.414
Those ants really do it
for you, don't they?

15:33.375 --> 15:36.461
- I need to drain the pasta.
- I know.

15:38.588 --> 15:41.842
Is that why you're stepping on my foot?

16:04.197 --> 16:08.410
I do. I really... I really need
to get the pasta now. I do.

16:36.938 --> 16:40.275
Don't creepy-eye me, Ant Man.

16:40.651 --> 16:43.303
I remember you back in school.

16:43.403 --> 16:47.115
Poor girls. Bring the pot, please?

16:54.456 --> 16:56.249
Just baby dreams.

17:20.272 --> 17:22.108
Okay.

17:24.111 --> 17:25.820
Colm.

17:26.195 --> 17:29.491
- It's okay. It's okay.
- It's Colm.

17:32.077 --> 17:34.871
Honey, it's okay. It's o...

17:55.350 --> 17:56.768
Yeah, police.

18:02.107 --> 18:04.776
Well, your window's definitely broke

18:04.901 --> 18:06.778
but your frame looks intact.

18:06.903 --> 18:09.306
I understand stuff like this
can get quite unnerving

18:09.406 --> 18:11.975
especially when it happens
in the middle of the night.

18:12.075 --> 18:14.311
But I wouldn't worry about it too much
it's probably just some bird

18:14.411 --> 18:16.330
that's dipped his beak in too many pints.

18:16.496 --> 18:18.415
How does a bird throw a lamp?

18:18.915 --> 18:20.625
Well...

18:22.044 --> 18:24.613
see a shiny object through the window

18:24.713 --> 18:26.865
flies in, gets injured,
flies around the room

18:26.965 --> 18:29.760
knocks over a lamp. Happens all the time.

18:29.885 --> 18:31.745
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

18:31.845 --> 18:35.807
Mr. Hitchens, this isn't London.
Things here go bump in the night.

18:36.433 --> 18:39.478
Look, we've not been well received here.

18:39.603 --> 18:41.046
- Our neighbor...
- Colm?

18:41.146 --> 18:43.257
- Colm, yes.
- Not without cause.

18:43.357 --> 18:45.425
You're aware?

18:45.525 --> 18:48.695
Everybody is. You're making people
nervous when you're out there.

18:48.820 --> 18:51.406
- It's my job.
- I know, Mr. Hitchens.

18:51.531 --> 18:55.202
- But these people have got certain beliefs.
- Beliefs?

18:55.494 --> 19:00.916
They believe that the forest that you're
trampling on belongs to the Hallow.

19:01.041 --> 19:03.569
- The Hallow?
- The good people.

19:03.669 --> 19:08.590
Fairies, banshees, baby stealers.

19:09.174 --> 19:12.452
You're not afraid with your Irish folklore,
are you, Mr. Hitchens?

19:12.552 --> 19:16.206
A conquered people, forever in hiding

19:16.306 --> 19:20.894
driven from their sacred lands
by man with iron and fire.

19:21.645 --> 19:23.897
Beautifully told.

19:24.022 --> 19:26.108
So you're a believer?

19:26.858 --> 19:30.570
No, not me. I'm from Belfast.

19:30.946 --> 19:33.407
Different sort of boogeyman up there.

19:34.533 --> 19:38.996
But we're dealing with a very
superstitious people around here.

19:39.538 --> 19:41.398
Especially Mr. Donnelly.

19:41.498 --> 19:43.792
You see, his beautiful wee daughter Cora

19:43.917 --> 19:46.461
she wandered into the woods one day.

19:47.254 --> 19:49.381
She never came back.

19:50.298 --> 19:53.051
And he would have you believe
that they took her.

20:17.284 --> 20:19.353
I'm sorry.

20:19.453 --> 20:21.496
Should have just...

20:21.955 --> 20:24.207
gone and talked to Colm.

20:25.250 --> 20:28.003
- Do you really think...
- Or what?

20:28.462 --> 20:30.714
A drunken bird?

20:31.882 --> 20:33.759
Or a...

20:35.302 --> 20:37.387
A Hallow?

20:41.725 --> 20:44.478
He's just trying to scare us, that's all.

20:51.652 --> 20:53.820
You should sleep.

20:54.946 --> 20:56.448
I'll be right back.

20:57.532 --> 21:01.328
- Where are you going?
- Just gonna take some pictures.

21:01.912 --> 21:03.789
For evidence.

22:14.818 --> 22:16.403
Iggs?

22:18.030 --> 22:19.781
Iggy?

22:20.782 --> 22:22.868
Come here, Iggs.

22:43.638 --> 22:45.932
What's wrong, Iggs?

24:34.124 --> 24:36.626
Adam, love.

24:39.671 --> 24:42.507
- It's noon.
- Shit.

24:44.676 --> 24:46.553
Fell asleep.

24:51.224 --> 24:53.669
I'm gonna get the window mended.

24:53.769 --> 24:55.354
And Colm?

24:56.229 --> 24:59.608
Yeah. I'll see him tonight. Promise.

27:23.627 --> 27:27.547
Gotta get out there, here you go.

27:43.981 --> 27:46.358
We had an incident.

27:46.817 --> 27:51.029
Police seem to think a pissed off
bird mistook my house for his.

27:51.655 --> 27:55.325
- You're the tree doctor?
- Not exactly, but, yeah.

27:57.953 --> 28:00.455
If you trespass upon them...

28:00.956 --> 28:03.609
- they'll trespass upon you.
- Is that right?

28:03.709 --> 28:05.277
Look, I'll fix this

28:05.377 --> 28:09.256
but if your wife doesn't put the iron
back up there's really no point.

28:44.291 --> 28:46.376
You don't listen.

28:51.089 --> 28:53.383
You think I'm crazy?

29:03.143 --> 29:05.771
Please. Plea...

30:02.494 --> 30:05.664
Come on, Finn. We're almost home.

30:11.962 --> 30:13.964
Here we go.

31:02.888 --> 31:06.767
Finn. Come on, buddy. It's okay.

31:08.018 --> 31:09.728
Fuck.

31:20.822 --> 31:23.075
Back in a minute.

33:12.351 --> 33:14.227
Finn? Finn!

33:30.994 --> 33:32.788
Finn?

33:50.847 --> 33:53.058
It's alright, Finn.

34:00.315 --> 34:02.025
Hey.

34:02.359 --> 34:05.070
Come on. Come on.

34:07.489 --> 34:09.366
It's alright.

34:17.708 --> 34:19.543
Oh, my...

34:41.898 --> 34:43.467
Come on.

34:43.567 --> 34:45.527
Good boy.

35:08.550 --> 35:11.345
- Claire?
- In here.

35:11.637 --> 35:14.556
- Where have you been?
- I was hoofin'.

35:14.681 --> 35:18.544
- You okay?
- I tried to call you. Colm was here.

35:18.644 --> 35:20.562
In the house?

35:20.687 --> 35:23.674
Take Finn upstairs. Call the police.

35:23.774 --> 35:26.026
Adam, what's going on?

35:27.152 --> 35:30.072
- Answer me.
- Just call the police.

35:35.369 --> 35:37.120
Adam?

35:40.457 --> 35:42.084
Do you know how to use that?

35:42.209 --> 35:45.087
- Doesn't matter.
- No, it's not right.

35:45.420 --> 35:47.339
It's just in case.

35:47.464 --> 35:49.841
Until the police arrive.

36:42.936 --> 36:45.731
Stay here. Lock the door.

36:53.739 --> 36:57.242
It's okay. It's okay.

37:16.345 --> 37:18.639
The police are coming!

37:40.410 --> 37:42.120
Colm.

37:43.413 --> 37:45.916
whatever happened to your daughter...

37:46.083 --> 37:48.251
has nothing to do with us.

38:33.630 --> 38:35.382
Adam?

38:47.144 --> 38:48.562
Adam?

38:55.610 --> 38:57.930
Adam, are you okay?

38:58.030 --> 39:01.700
No. No, I'm not okay.

39:03.452 --> 39:06.163
He came into our house.

39:06.997 --> 39:08.790
He came into our home.

39:24.556 --> 39:27.059
Stop! Adam, stop!

39:27.517 --> 39:29.478
Don't lose your head.

39:31.605 --> 39:33.649
Hey, hey, hey...

39:47.537 --> 39:49.314
This...

39:49.414 --> 39:52.542
- this is not right.
- I know.

39:53.085 --> 39:57.506
- We just need to leave.
- We're not fucking leaving.

39:58.006 --> 40:02.260
We've been here a month.
We haven't bothered anyone.

40:02.386 --> 40:04.471
I'm not being intimidated by that man!

40:04.596 --> 40:08.141
Adam, just calm down.

40:20.404 --> 40:22.447
What's this?

40:22.864 --> 40:25.242
Colm brought it over.

40:48.181 --> 40:50.684
It's a book of fucking fairy tales.

40:50.809 --> 40:53.253
We need to leave now.

40:53.353 --> 40:55.063
Okay.

40:56.064 --> 40:58.400
Get Finn's bag.

40:59.526 --> 41:01.278
I'm sorry, Claire.

41:13.123 --> 41:14.875
Iggy!

41:20.505 --> 41:22.282
Iggy!

41:22.382 --> 41:23.967
Stay here, Claire.

41:42.694 --> 41:44.446
Iggs.

41:46.281 --> 41:47.908
Iggs.

41:56.833 --> 41:58.627
Iggy.

42:10.806 --> 42:14.726
Jesus, Iggs. What did they do to you?

42:15.185 --> 42:17.437
Come on. Let's go.

42:32.995 --> 42:34.788
Iggs.

42:36.832 --> 42:38.417
Iggy.

42:46.842 --> 42:49.928
- Iggy! Come back here.
- Iggy!

42:59.646 --> 43:03.258
- Bastard! Bastards.
- Come on. Adam, come on.

43:03.358 --> 43:05.235
Cowards.

43:19.499 --> 43:21.752
Claire, take the bag.

43:29.801 --> 43:32.220
- You ready?
- No, wait.

43:33.221 --> 43:35.015
Come on.

43:35.140 --> 43:37.017
Okay, now.

43:44.691 --> 43:46.777
It's not.

43:50.530 --> 43:52.574
Okay, hit it again.

44:01.291 --> 44:02.668
- Adam.
- Wait!

44:02.793 --> 44:04.528
Quick, Adam! There's something back there!

44:04.628 --> 44:06.296
Go, now.

44:13.136 --> 44:15.389
Well, come on, Adam! Come on!

44:21.061 --> 44:23.981
Get in, get in, get in.

44:25.357 --> 44:28.135
Get in, get in, get in!

44:28.235 --> 44:30.070
Get in!

44:32.447 --> 44:34.241
Sorry!

44:35.575 --> 44:38.704
Adam, get in! Get in, get in, get in!

44:39.746 --> 44:41.206
Go!

44:44.418 --> 44:47.587
- Get to the road, Claire!
- I am, I am!

44:53.385 --> 44:55.178
Let's go!

44:59.433 --> 45:01.727
Is he okay? Is he okay?

45:30.464 --> 45:33.842
Claire, you alright? Finn.

45:35.218 --> 45:36.637
Finn.

45:44.186 --> 45:45.771
Careful.

45:47.898 --> 45:50.442
- It's okay. He's okay.
- Finn?

45:50.567 --> 45:52.444
He's okay!

45:57.157 --> 45:59.993
Come on. Come on, come on, come on.

46:15.258 --> 46:17.052
Claire.

46:17.761 --> 46:19.246
- Please listen, okay?
- What?

46:19.346 --> 46:21.748
- Claire.
- Adam, what?

46:21.848 --> 46:24.559
- It's... it's...
- Stop. Stop. Don't try.

46:24.851 --> 46:27.938
We saw the same thing. The Hallow.

46:28.563 --> 46:30.482
It's real.

46:54.798 --> 46:57.367
God! Goddamn it!

46:57.467 --> 47:00.721
- Show me, show me, show me.
- Something in my eye.

47:37.466 --> 47:39.509
Get the other torch!

47:40.677 --> 47:44.164
Upstairs. Go quickly. Upstairs.

47:44.264 --> 47:45.682
Now!

47:51.563 --> 47:53.815
Watch out, Claire.

47:57.110 --> 47:59.154
Go up there.

47:59.780 --> 48:02.991
Take this. Hide up there, Claire.

48:03.408 --> 48:06.603
- Why?
- If the light hurt it, I gotta go back out.

48:06.703 --> 48:09.081
I've gotta start the generator.

48:09.206 --> 48:11.124
Go up there now.

50:16.124 --> 50:17.876
Honey, it's okay.

50:38.772 --> 50:41.817
Adam? Adam?

50:42.484 --> 50:44.945
- Claire?
- Adam.

50:50.826 --> 50:52.619
Claire?

51:12.222 --> 51:14.266
It's okay, Finnball.

51:15.350 --> 51:16.810
It's okay.

54:04.144 --> 54:05.687
Adam?

54:34.383 --> 54:37.010
No, no!

54:58.448 --> 55:00.575
Bastards.

55:22.306 --> 55:25.976
- Are you okay?
- I'm alright. Fine.

55:34.443 --> 55:36.361
It's okay.

55:37.487 --> 55:39.906
I'm gonna need your help with these.

55:48.248 --> 55:50.250
Light and iron.

55:50.375 --> 55:52.711
That's what the policeman said.

55:54.212 --> 55:56.965
Claire, can you put it across the middle?

55:57.466 --> 56:00.177
Hold it there. Okay.

56:04.014 --> 56:07.351
- Hang these up.
- How do you know this is going to work?

56:07.601 --> 56:08.894
I'm certain.

57:00.696 --> 57:02.489
- Alright?
- What are you doing?

57:02.614 --> 57:04.866
It's not safe for him.

57:08.161 --> 57:10.522
- You... you can't put him in there.
- Where else?

57:10.622 --> 57:12.482
With us.

57:12.582 --> 57:14.376
Claire...

57:14.501 --> 57:16.695
the generator's gonna die.

57:16.795 --> 57:20.215
When it does, he's safer
in here than he is with us.

57:20.590 --> 57:22.467
I promise.

57:22.759 --> 57:25.429
If he so much as whimpers,
we'll get him out.

57:25.554 --> 57:27.306
Okay?

57:38.817 --> 57:41.069
It's just till dawn.

57:42.195 --> 57:43.864
Listen.

57:45.866 --> 57:47.617
Listen.

57:48.410 --> 57:51.021
See? It's fine.

57:51.121 --> 57:52.873
Alright.

58:48.971 --> 58:51.306
"Hallow be thy name.

58:51.598 --> 58:54.726
"Blessed be thy claim.

58:56.395 --> 59:00.757
"If you who trespass put down roots...

59:00.857 --> 59:04.903
"then Hallow be your name."

59:07.155 --> 59:08.949
Adam?

59:22.587 --> 59:24.423
"Changeling."

59:26.049 --> 59:27.467
Adam?

59:33.932 --> 59:36.418
- Checking on Finn.
- Don't. You'll wake him.

59:36.518 --> 59:38.895
I don't care. I want to see him.

59:39.021 --> 59:40.647
You have the monitor.

59:40.772 --> 59:43.233
Just listen. He's fine.

59:47.821 --> 59:49.489
See?

59:49.614 --> 59:51.033
He's asleep.

01:00:48.632 --> 01:00:51.134
Heya, Finnball.

01:00:56.556 --> 01:00:58.266
Adam...

01:01:01.144 --> 01:01:04.147
No! No, no, no, no! Adam!

01:01:05.691 --> 01:01:08.026
It's taken him.

01:01:08.443 --> 01:01:09.945
Finn!

01:01:11.863 --> 01:01:14.449
Please give him back!

01:01:15.158 --> 01:01:17.160
Please give him back!

01:01:20.747 --> 01:01:22.624
Finn!

01:01:23.333 --> 01:01:25.194
- Finn!
- It's in the beam! It's in the beam!

01:01:25.294 --> 01:01:27.004
It's in the beam.

01:01:32.634 --> 01:01:34.136
No, no!

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:38.140
- You'll hit him! You'll hit him!
- It's gone up.

01:01:38.724 --> 01:01:41.310
Please find him. Please find him.

01:01:48.817 --> 01:01:51.111
There you are.

01:02:03.874 --> 01:02:05.584
Adam.

01:02:06.918 --> 01:02:10.505
Adam? Adam? Adam?

01:02:12.716 --> 01:02:14.384
Finn.

01:02:20.098 --> 01:02:23.310
Come on. Come on. Get up!

01:02:23.935 --> 01:02:25.937
Please get up!

01:02:26.521 --> 01:02:29.733
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

01:03:44.850 --> 01:03:46.810
Finn!

01:04:26.266 --> 01:04:28.226
No!

01:05:51.018 --> 01:05:52.894
Give me.

01:05:59.651 --> 01:06:02.029
He needs to be dried and changed.

01:06:09.786 --> 01:06:12.456
Quick, Adam, he's freezing.

01:06:14.082 --> 01:06:15.834
Here.

01:06:18.837 --> 01:06:20.631
Adam?

01:06:25.302 --> 01:06:28.847
- It's not Finn.
- What did you say?

01:06:36.229 --> 01:06:38.190
Look at him.

01:06:40.734 --> 01:06:41.818
Adam?

01:06:44.279 --> 01:06:46.490
It's a changeling.

01:06:46.615 --> 01:06:48.241
No.

01:06:51.244 --> 01:06:54.915
You need help. We need to get you help.

01:06:56.416 --> 01:06:58.585
Give him to me.

01:07:04.257 --> 01:07:05.550
Give him to me.

01:07:05.676 --> 01:07:08.011
- It's a trick.
- No.

01:07:08.929 --> 01:07:10.931
Adam, look at yourself.

01:07:11.056 --> 01:07:13.558
They're in your head! Like the ants!

01:07:13.976 --> 01:07:16.228
It's not Finn.

01:07:16.436 --> 01:07:17.312
- This is...
- Listen.

01:07:17.437 --> 01:07:19.314
- Give him to me.
- No!

01:07:19.439 --> 01:07:20.883
- No!
- Give him to me!

01:07:20.983 --> 01:07:22.843
Adam!

01:07:22.943 --> 01:07:25.904
Listen to me, they're in your head.

01:07:51.013 --> 01:07:54.416
Show yourself. Show yourself!

01:07:54.516 --> 01:07:56.768
Show yourself.

01:07:59.271 --> 01:08:00.981
Show yourself.

01:08:14.911 --> 01:08:17.205
Show yourself.

01:08:20.125 --> 01:08:21.917
Please, Adam.

01:08:32.638 --> 01:08:34.680
Where's my boy?

01:08:46.526 --> 01:08:48.319
Claire!

01:08:57.746 --> 01:08:59.857
- Claire, wait!
- No, no, no! Stay back!

01:08:59.957 --> 01:09:01.649
Wait, you don't know what you're doing!

01:09:01.750 --> 01:09:03.752
- We have to find Finn!
- This is Finn!

01:09:03.877 --> 01:09:06.029
They tried to trick us!
They tried to trick us!

01:09:06.129 --> 01:09:09.116
- You're sick!
- It's not Finn!

01:09:09.216 --> 01:09:11.635
It's not Finn!

01:09:22.312 --> 01:09:25.357
- Claire!
- No!

01:09:30.904 --> 01:09:32.322
Claire!

01:09:36.535 --> 01:09:38.537
Claire!

01:10:26.752 --> 01:10:29.171
Give me the boy, Claire.

01:10:30.213 --> 01:10:32.549
He's not yours.

01:10:33.050 --> 01:10:36.620
He's not yours at all, Claire.

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:39.765
- Can't you tell?
- Please, Adam, please.

01:10:39.890 --> 01:10:41.833
You're wrong. You're sick.

01:10:41.933 --> 01:10:47.481
No, Claire. No, Claire.
No, please, please. No, no, no.

01:10:48.315 --> 01:10:50.942
It's... it's not me.

01:10:51.318 --> 01:10:55.572
I'm not the one that...
that's going to hurt you.

01:10:56.740 --> 01:11:01.161
The boy... the boy... the boy is.

01:11:01.286 --> 01:11:03.372
The boy is.

01:11:04.498 --> 01:11:08.543
You really... think
they'd give him back to you?

01:11:10.045 --> 01:11:13.048
They want you.

01:11:15.258 --> 01:11:16.493
Give him to me.

01:11:16.593 --> 01:11:19.638
They want... Claire!

01:11:19.763 --> 01:11:21.974
- Please.
- They want all of us!

01:11:22.099 --> 01:11:24.267
All of us!

01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:30.273
No!

01:11:38.824 --> 01:11:40.325
Get back!

01:11:40.993 --> 01:11:43.078
Stay away!

01:11:59.386 --> 01:12:01.096
Adam?

01:12:02.889 --> 01:12:04.975
What's happening?

01:12:08.687 --> 01:12:10.605
Adam?

01:12:28.206 --> 01:12:29.958
Adam?

01:12:30.083 --> 01:12:31.585
Adam?

01:12:34.588 --> 01:12:36.465
No!

01:12:36.590 --> 01:12:40.093
No! No!

01:12:41.136 --> 01:12:42.929
Claire!

01:12:46.558 --> 01:12:48.560
Claire!

01:12:56.943 --> 01:12:58.945
Claire!

01:14:36.293 --> 01:14:38.337
Claire!

01:14:58.940 --> 01:15:00.734
Claire!

01:17:20.874 --> 01:17:22.834
Please, I need help!

01:17:24.586 --> 01:17:26.421
Please.

01:17:26.838 --> 01:17:28.882
Thank you.

01:17:30.968 --> 01:17:32.844
Oh, thank...

01:17:37.391 --> 01:17:38.959
Get away from here.

01:17:39.059 --> 01:17:41.253
You... you have to help us.

01:17:41.353 --> 01:17:43.397
I already did.

01:17:44.147 --> 01:17:46.525
I know, but please.

01:17:47.234 --> 01:17:49.778
I can't help you. I can't.

01:17:50.278 --> 01:17:52.531
They took my Cora.

01:17:52.990 --> 01:17:55.450
They took my little girl.

01:17:56.994 --> 01:17:59.079
They take what we love most, and...

01:18:01.748 --> 01:18:04.668
Be gone now before you
bring them down here.

01:18:05.544 --> 01:18:09.047
Take my baby, please. Just until morning.

01:18:09.381 --> 01:18:13.035
- Please, Colm, please!
- He should've listened!

01:18:13.135 --> 01:18:14.886
Go!

01:18:15.012 --> 01:18:16.722
Go!

01:18:20.726 --> 01:18:23.437
You should never have come here!

01:18:59.056 --> 01:19:00.557
Cora?

01:19:54.987 --> 01:19:56.697
No, Cora.

01:22:51.246 --> 01:22:52.998
Claire?

01:23:02.633 --> 01:23:04.051
Adam?

01:23:16.897 --> 01:23:19.107
I got him back.

01:23:19.608 --> 01:23:22.761
- What is that?
- It's... it's Finn.

01:23:22.861 --> 01:23:25.280
No. Adam, no.

01:23:32.162 --> 01:23:34.748
That's why they're here.

01:23:36.166 --> 01:23:38.377
They want... Finn.

01:23:41.755 --> 01:23:44.591
They want him for their family.

01:23:49.888 --> 01:23:51.139
Take him.

01:23:53.684 --> 01:23:56.795
Leave that thing. It's one of them.

01:23:56.895 --> 01:24:00.357
It's... it's nothing. It's a trick.

01:24:12.828 --> 01:24:14.079
Adam!

01:24:39.062 --> 01:24:41.606
Claire... take him.

01:24:44.484 --> 01:24:46.361
Take him.

01:25:00.459 --> 01:25:02.169
Adam?

01:25:04.046 --> 01:25:05.964
I did...

01:29:17.382 --> 01:29:20.218
You're so beautiful.
