00:02.628 --> 00:04.380
(indistinct announcement
over intercom)

00:13.055 --> 00:15.353
MAN (over intercom):
International arrivals,

00:15.557 --> 00:16.979
please proceed directly
to passport control.

00:17.184 --> 00:19.937
All international
arrivals should

00:20.145 --> 00:21.567
proceed directly
to passport control.

00:27.236 --> 00:29.204
Attention, passengers,

00:29.404 --> 00:32.078
please do not leave
your luggage unattended.

00:32.281 --> 00:34.205
Unattended luggage is
subject to collection

00:34.409 --> 00:37.037
and search by airport police.
Thank you for your cooperation.

00:37.246 --> 00:39.749
Hand, please.

00:45.337 --> 00:46.930
Gary Lester.

00:49.716 --> 00:51.013
What's the nature of your visit?

00:51.218 --> 00:53.641
Um... visiting a friend.

00:55.973 --> 00:58.192
You traveling alone?

00:58.392 --> 01:00.986
Uh, yes. Alone.

01:01.186 --> 01:03.029
Nothing to declare?

01:03.230 --> 01:05.528
No... sir.

01:05.732 --> 01:07.109
Nothing.

01:15.784 --> 01:17.502
Khartoum to Atlanta.

01:18.370 --> 01:20.793
What's that... 19
hours, give or take?

01:20.998 --> 01:22.841
You must be running on fumes.

01:25.836 --> 01:27.930
What were you doing in Sudan?

01:28.130 --> 01:31.350
Uh... just hanging out.

01:31.550 --> 01:32.847
You know...

01:33.051 --> 01:34.052
tourist stuff.

01:34.261 --> 01:35.934
Yeah, fascinating.

01:36.138 --> 01:39.142
Tell me about the bottle.

01:39.349 --> 01:41.477
Um, it's-it's an antique.

01:41.685 --> 01:44.689
It's very precious.

01:44.896 --> 01:46.148
Oh, please.

01:46.356 --> 01:48.575
Don't touch it.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.956
Yeah, the residue test
didn't turn up nothing.

01:54.156 --> 01:55.954
But here's the
wrinkle, Mr. Lester.

01:56.158 --> 01:58.126
This ain't my first rodeo.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.461
Look, I'm warning you, man,

02:03.665 --> 02:05.042
this is not a game.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.628
Don't open the bottle.

02:07.836 --> 02:10.806
Please... please.

02:12.299 --> 02:13.516
(grunts)

02:18.263 --> 02:20.561
The hell?

02:58.053 --> 03:00.602
(indistinct chatter)

03:00.806 --> 03:02.103
ZED:
You were right about the park.

03:02.307 --> 03:03.729
This closeness to nature,

03:03.934 --> 03:06.153
the energy, the people.

03:06.353 --> 03:07.525
Yeah.

03:07.729 --> 03:08.981
My senses, they feel heightened.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.816
It's-it's like a...

03:11.024 --> 03:12.321
A drug?

03:12.526 --> 03:13.698
I wouldn't know.

03:13.902 --> 03:15.825
Seriously?

03:16.029 --> 03:17.497
You've never dabbled?

03:17.698 --> 03:18.915
Seriously.

03:19.116 --> 03:20.868
You try having
visions like mine,

03:21.076 --> 03:22.043
and see if you're still
interested in dabbling.

03:22.244 --> 03:24.793
I need more control, not less.

03:24.996 --> 03:26.464
Huh.

03:26.665 --> 03:29.134
Well, sometimes control
is about letting go.

03:29.334 --> 03:30.802
Psychic energy is all around us.

03:31.002 --> 03:33.175
It's like a network.

03:33.380 --> 03:36.099
You have the ability
to travel that network.

03:36.299 --> 03:38.597
But you have to lower
your walls first.

03:38.802 --> 03:40.304
And then you'll be able to see

03:40.512 --> 03:41.855
how far you can really go.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.194
I see coins.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.572
(laughs)
They're falling all around us.

03:50.772 --> 03:53.616
It's so beautiful!

04:00.323 --> 04:03.076
CONSTANTINE:
Pennies from heaven?

04:03.285 --> 04:05.788
Subtle as a serpent.

04:05.996 --> 04:07.589
People have their
own unique markers

04:07.789 --> 04:09.962
for when celestial
beings are close by.

04:10.167 --> 04:13.762
She's, uh, rather
traditional, it seems.

04:13.962 --> 04:16.385
How's she doing?
You think she can help us?

04:16.589 --> 04:18.512
Well, she's more than
handled herself this far.

04:18.716 --> 04:20.935
MANNY: You're putting a lot
of time and effort into her.

04:21.136 --> 04:22.809
Let's hope it's not wasted.

04:23.013 --> 04:25.015
Wouldn't want to go
down that road again.

04:26.892 --> 04:29.987
Well, she's as tough as
they come, this one.

04:30.187 --> 04:32.064
And it's just until
we can sort out

04:32.272 --> 04:35.196
this, uh, Rising
Darkness nonsense.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.869
Then she's free to go
on her own merry way.

04:38.069 --> 04:40.492
Unless you scare her off before.

04:40.697 --> 04:43.416
Not everybody's cut out
to do what you do.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.415
And not everybody has
the stomach to watch you do it.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.371
Well, then I'll have
to go it alone.

04:47.579 --> 04:49.422
Like I always have.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.000
Now, you gonna make me guess?

04:51.208 --> 04:53.256
Or are you gonna tell me
what's going on?

04:53.460 --> 04:54.552
I know something is.

04:54.753 --> 04:56.130
Why else would you be here?

04:56.338 --> 04:58.761
I'm not.

05:09.392 --> 05:11.690
(bird squawks)

05:13.522 --> 05:15.866
ZED: Where's Chas?

05:16.066 --> 05:18.239
CONSTANTINE: I told him
to fix that cab of his.

05:18.443 --> 05:20.787
Figured we'd work
on your training today.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.864
So, how am I doing?

05:23.073 --> 05:26.373
You're showing flashes
of precognition,

05:26.576 --> 05:27.828
retrocognition,

05:28.036 --> 05:29.663
clairtangence.
You're a real bitsa.

05:29.871 --> 05:30.417
Come again?

05:30.622 --> 05:31.168
Uh, a bitsa, you know?

05:31.373 --> 05:32.590
You've got bits of
everything in you.

05:32.791 --> 05:33.667
Hold up.

05:35.210 --> 05:37.258
A break-in.

05:37.462 --> 05:39.135
Pretty clumsy one, too.

05:39.339 --> 05:43.060
You might want to stay out here.

05:43.260 --> 05:45.308
The intruder...
Whoever or whatever it is...

05:45.512 --> 05:46.559
Will still be in there.

05:46.763 --> 05:47.935
How do you know that?

05:48.139 --> 05:49.891
Ol' Jasper went
to a lot of trouble

05:50.100 --> 05:52.102
to safeguard everything
contained in these walls.

05:52.310 --> 05:55.564
I almost feel sorry
for whatever's inside.

05:55.772 --> 05:57.991
(door closes)

06:05.156 --> 06:08.376
Seriously disgusting.

06:08.577 --> 06:09.999
Khapra beetles.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.422
One of the most destructive
pests in the world.

06:12.622 --> 06:15.466
I'll assume that's
not a good sign?

06:15.667 --> 06:17.214
It's a pretty safe bet.

06:17.419 --> 06:18.295
GARY: John?

06:18.503 --> 06:21.256
John, is that you?

06:21.464 --> 06:24.183
Well, bugger me.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.512
Gary bloody Lester.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.724
I... I knocked,
but nobody was home.

06:29.931 --> 06:31.433
So...

06:31.641 --> 06:33.143
You got yourself caught
in the zero gravity trap?

06:33.351 --> 06:34.898
I don't know
what you call it, man. I...

06:35.103 --> 06:36.229
Oh!

06:36.438 --> 06:38.907
I just want it to stop!

06:39.107 --> 06:41.235
It's been a long time, Gary.

06:41.443 --> 06:44.322
I haven't seen you since, uh...

06:44.529 --> 06:45.746
Newcastle.

06:45.947 --> 06:46.664
Yeah.

06:46.865 --> 06:48.788
I know.

06:48.992 --> 06:50.994
You know, nobody knew
where you went, Gaz.

06:51.202 --> 06:52.829
You just vanished.

06:54.664 --> 06:56.007
I had to get away.

06:56.207 --> 06:57.299
I needed
to straighten myself out.

06:57.500 --> 06:58.752
Oh, yeah.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.212
Bang-up job you've
done of that, mate.

07:02.297 --> 07:04.140
GARY: Well, with everything
that happened, you know,

07:04.341 --> 07:07.971
with Astra...

07:09.971 --> 07:13.066
I just needed to escape, man.

07:13.266 --> 07:16.395
Well, good for you, Gary.

07:18.563 --> 07:20.236
Who's Astra?

07:23.693 --> 07:25.445
Well, go on then.

07:25.654 --> 07:28.407
What daft mess have you
gotten yourself into now?

07:28.615 --> 07:29.832
And why is this place

07:30.033 --> 07:32.912
crawling with bugs?

07:33.119 --> 07:34.496
It's bad, John.

07:34.704 --> 07:37.002
It's really bad. But I di...

07:37.207 --> 07:39.005
I didn't mean for it to happen
this way, I swear it.

07:40.669 --> 07:43.513
It started out as a bender.

07:43.713 --> 07:47.434
Uh, then one night turned
into two and then a week.

07:47.634 --> 07:50.979
And then, well,
I-I-I just got lost in it all.

07:51.179 --> 07:53.728
I don't even know how,
but next thing I know,

07:53.932 --> 07:56.731
I'm in Sudan.

07:56.935 --> 07:59.029
And, uh, I'm looking to get on.

07:59.229 --> 08:02.733
But as soon as Isaw him...
I knew.

08:02.941 --> 08:06.115
He had these, these containment
markings all over his face.

08:06.319 --> 08:09.698
You know, the power
patterns for binding.

08:09.906 --> 08:12.625
Some bastard had trapped
a demon in him.

08:12.826 --> 08:16.501
I knew what I had to do.

08:16.705 --> 08:19.959
This was my chance
to make up for Newcastle.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.294
This was my chance

08:22.502 --> 08:24.550
to atone.

08:26.965 --> 08:30.720
It was like
an irresistible passion

08:30.927 --> 08:33.304
just seized me.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.732
It wasn't
that I wanted to do it.

08:37.058 --> 08:38.230
I needed to.

08:41.520 --> 08:42.613
(grunting)

08:42.813 --> 08:44.236
(indistinct chanting)

08:48.528 --> 08:52.032
You should've seen me, John.

08:52.198 --> 08:53.745
You really should've seen me.

08:53.950 --> 08:56.578
(chanting in ancient language)

09:13.928 --> 09:16.306
I did it, John.

09:16.514 --> 09:20.314
I trapped a demon in a bottle.

09:21.811 --> 09:23.108
Where's the bottle now?

09:28.318 --> 09:28.910
Hey!

09:29.110 --> 09:29.702
(screams)

09:29.903 --> 09:32.577
What's your problem, man?!

09:32.781 --> 09:35.409
Hey! (grunts)

09:35.575 --> 09:38.169
(growling)

09:38.369 --> 09:39.712
MAN: What's going on here?!

09:39.913 --> 09:41.540
Hey! What do you think
you're doing...?

09:41.748 --> 09:42.419
(screams)

09:42.624 --> 09:44.171
(screaming, clamoring)

09:44.375 --> 09:46.753
Hey! (Yells)

09:46.961 --> 09:48.429
MAN: Someone get security!
This guy's crazy!

09:48.630 --> 09:51.053
Hey! Hey! What are you doing?!

09:51.257 --> 09:54.352
(crowd clamoring)

09:54.552 --> 09:56.975
(crowd gasping, screaming)

10:25.750 --> 10:27.377
It looks like the Star of David.

10:27.585 --> 10:29.212
No, this is the Seal of Solomon.

10:29.420 --> 10:32.014
And this is the Taba'at Shlomo.

10:32.215 --> 10:33.888
Also known as the
Ring of Solomon.

10:34.092 --> 10:35.218
It was passed down to Solomon

10:35.426 --> 10:36.473
directly from heaven
to trap genies.

10:36.678 --> 10:38.100
So, you're gonna put

10:38.304 --> 10:39.806
Gary's genie back in the bottle?

10:40.014 --> 10:41.561
The Taba'at Shlomo has
strong containment magic.

10:41.766 --> 10:43.814
It's perfect for preparing

10:43.977 --> 10:45.194
any demon binding vessel.

10:45.395 --> 10:46.521
Should be sufficient

10:46.729 --> 10:48.106
to clean up that tosser's mess.

10:50.567 --> 10:51.739
You know, he's lucky
to have you as a friend.

10:53.903 --> 10:56.531
He's all right.

10:56.739 --> 10:58.366
He's just bloody hopeless.

10:58.575 --> 11:00.452
Nobody's hopeless.

11:03.621 --> 11:05.999
I wish that were true.

11:06.207 --> 11:07.880
His old man used
to have a car dealership

11:08.084 --> 11:09.757
and more money than
he could count.

11:09.961 --> 11:12.089
So, Gary always had
everything he ever wanted.

11:12.297 --> 11:14.140
Gary was good for cash and...

11:14.340 --> 11:17.014
well, that's about it.

11:17.218 --> 11:20.313
We had a bit of a crew that used
to run together back then.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.561
Gary was the only one
with a car.

11:22.765 --> 11:24.392
So, you used him.

11:26.561 --> 11:27.938
That depends on your
perspective, doesn't it?

11:28.146 --> 11:29.773
Maybe he used us,

11:29.981 --> 11:32.575
bought our friendship.

11:32.775 --> 11:35.654
If there was one thing Gary knew
how to do, it was use.

11:35.862 --> 11:38.456
Back in the day, he used
to love to get high.

11:38.656 --> 11:40.784
Just the party stuff,
nothing hard.

11:40.992 --> 11:45.088
But it seems that
after Newcastle,

11:45.288 --> 11:48.167
he's graduated
to full-blown junkie.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.468
You want to tell me
about Newcastle?

11:50.668 --> 11:52.466
It's a town
in the north of England.

11:52.670 --> 11:53.842
Horrible weather

11:54.047 --> 11:56.596
and even worse football team.

11:56.799 --> 11:59.393
You don't end up like Gary
over bad weather.

11:59.594 --> 12:02.097
Well, that's just him, isn't it?

12:02.305 --> 12:04.433
Gary's had more opportunities
handed to him in his life

12:04.641 --> 12:05.938
than I've had hot dinners.

12:06.142 --> 12:08.315
And he's pissed them all away.

12:08.519 --> 12:10.112
Gary's is a life wasted.

12:14.484 --> 12:18.034
B'hoah Shlomoh,
kvosh et hahosheh.

12:20.531 --> 12:22.659
All done.

12:22.867 --> 12:26.371
Now all we got to do is
find the bastard demon.

12:32.794 --> 12:35.297
(Pipes groan)

12:50.937 --> 12:53.315
##

13:10.331 --> 13:12.504
- How come she gets whatever she wants?
- Shh.

13:12.709 --> 13:13.631
She's over there!

13:13.835 --> 13:15.837
Ma'am, you cannot be doing that!

13:16.045 --> 13:17.843
(guard grunting,
spectators gasping)

13:20.174 --> 13:21.221
I'm hungry!

13:21.426 --> 13:22.973
I need help!

13:24.637 --> 13:26.890
(screaming)

13:30.184 --> 13:32.437
FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR: It is not
yet known whether the virus is

13:32.645 --> 13:35.273
transmitted via these insects
or person to person.

13:35.481 --> 13:37.609
There is, however, little doubt

13:37.817 --> 13:39.819
that this outbreak could
mushroom, and rapidly...

13:40.028 --> 13:41.951
The gift that keeps on
giving, eh, Gaz?

13:42.155 --> 13:44.453
Msuggest that the victims
were gorging on food

13:44.657 --> 13:45.909
just prior
to their sudden deaths.

13:46.117 --> 13:49.417
Diagnostic tests are underway
on these vic...

13:49.620 --> 13:51.793
Sounds like a hunger demon.

13:51.998 --> 13:54.296
Nasty mindless bastards
with no thought

13:54.500 --> 13:56.753
other than to consume to excess.

13:56.961 --> 13:57.837
Sound familiar?

13:58.046 --> 13:59.423
I'm clean now, John,

13:59.630 --> 14:01.177
and it's gonna stay
that way, I swear.

14:01.382 --> 14:03.851
Oh, leave it out, Gaz,
I don't have the time.

14:04.052 --> 14:05.725
That thing's gonna eat its way
through the heart of the city,

14:05.928 --> 14:07.726
one poor wretch at a time,
unless I stop it.

14:07.930 --> 14:08.977
I'm coming with you.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.274
Are you taking the piss?

14:10.475 --> 14:11.226
It's my responsibility.

14:11.434 --> 14:12.185
Forget it.

14:12.393 --> 14:15.988
You're the last person I
want by my side on this.

14:17.607 --> 14:18.984
On anything.

14:20.401 --> 14:21.744
Do us a favor, will you?

14:21.944 --> 14:23.070
Watch over him.

14:24.822 --> 14:26.039
John.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.617
John.

14:27.825 --> 14:28.997
You know, I don't see
a lot of people

14:29.202 --> 14:30.124
lining up to lend you a hand.

14:31.454 --> 14:33.001
Maybe you should
accept his help.

14:33.206 --> 14:33.877
People can change, you know?

14:34.082 --> 14:34.753
Bollocks.

14:34.957 --> 14:37.460
We are who we are.

14:37.668 --> 14:39.011
Eventually.

14:44.926 --> 14:47.520
There he goes again.

14:47.720 --> 14:51.475
Charging head first
into the face of danger.

14:51.682 --> 14:53.810
Is that what happened
at Newcastle?

14:54.018 --> 14:55.941
John doesn't seem to want
to talk about it.

14:56.145 --> 14:59.570
Too much pain.

14:59.774 --> 15:01.572
Same reason I got
into the junk...

15:01.776 --> 15:03.949
Try to forget.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.154
Thing like that...

15:07.323 --> 15:08.825
you don't ever forget.

15:11.119 --> 15:12.792
Back then, we all thought
John was the duck's nuts.

15:12.995 --> 15:15.589
I mean, some of the crew were
interested in the occult,

15:15.790 --> 15:18.839
but most of us just wanted
to be around him.

15:19.043 --> 15:23.173
So when he started talking
about this trip to Newcastle,

15:23.381 --> 15:25.804
we all jumped at the chance.

15:26.008 --> 15:30.684
Road trip, some black magic
with the John Constantine.

15:30.888 --> 15:33.812
Who could say no?

15:35.518 --> 15:37.941
But then there was this girl.

15:38.146 --> 15:41.320
She was a daughter
of one of John's friends.

15:41.524 --> 15:43.993
She was possessed.

15:44.193 --> 15:48.369
Nobody knew what to do,
how to save her.

15:48.573 --> 15:50.450
John?

15:50.658 --> 15:52.285
He had a plan.

15:52.493 --> 15:54.086
Astra?

15:54.287 --> 15:57.507
I heard you mention
that name before.

15:57.707 --> 15:59.004
What happened to her?

16:05.506 --> 16:08.555
Hey, man.

16:08.759 --> 16:13.765
I'm sure you did what you could.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.271
You cared enough to try,
and that's what counts.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.071
Gary!

17:07.401 --> 17:10.200
Excuse me.

17:10.404 --> 17:12.202
You mind if I ask you
a few questions?

17:12.406 --> 17:14.534
I already told everybody...
We didn't see anything.

17:14.742 --> 17:16.869
Look, I know
what you're thinking.

17:17.078 --> 17:18.625
If I tell this guy what I saw,

17:18.829 --> 17:19.876
he's gonna think
I'm crazy, right?

17:20.080 --> 17:21.252
Look, we just want to go home.

17:21.457 --> 17:22.333
Please.

17:22.541 --> 17:24.135
Two minutes, that's all I need.

17:25.711 --> 17:28.430
There were bugs.

17:29.799 --> 17:31.551
Lots of bugs.

17:31.759 --> 17:32.851
Is that so?

17:34.387 --> 17:36.481
When the woman died,

17:36.681 --> 17:39.355
they just came up out of her,
like a swarm.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.357
I mean, most people
had run off by then,

17:41.561 --> 17:42.858
but we were still there.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.736
What happened to them
after they left the woman?

17:45.940 --> 17:47.863
Well, that's where
it gets real crazy

17:48.067 --> 17:49.944
because they just
flew into a swarm

17:50.152 --> 17:51.529
and then there was
this guy, this, uh...

17:51.737 --> 17:52.829
a meat delivery guy,

17:53.030 --> 17:54.907
and they all just flew
right into him.

17:55.116 --> 17:56.663
You happen to catch
the name of the company

17:56.867 --> 17:57.743
the delivery guy worked for?

18:00.496 --> 18:02.248
There was a pig and a cow
dancing on his shirt.

18:02.456 --> 18:04.254
Dancing, were they?

18:04.417 --> 18:06.294
Wow, that's something
I'd like to see.

18:07.253 --> 18:09.301
Thanks a lot.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.810
You wouldn't be laughing if you
knew what was in store for you.

18:35.489 --> 18:37.912
There anyone in here?

19:03.601 --> 19:05.478
##

19:28.084 --> 19:31.714
Ah, this gets more fun
by the second.

19:31.921 --> 19:34.674
Anyone in here still alive?

19:34.882 --> 19:36.429
Preferably not possessed
and feeling peckish?

19:41.597 --> 19:42.689
Hello.

19:42.848 --> 19:44.395
(hisses)

19:44.600 --> 19:45.601
Uh, Jo.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.354
Well, we can chat later,

19:48.562 --> 19:51.190
but right now I'm addressing
the entity inside you.

19:51.399 --> 19:52.321
(growls)

19:58.489 --> 20:00.662
Melech Eloheem...

20:00.866 --> 20:01.992
(growls)

20:02.201 --> 20:03.373
hab0reh vehayotzer
pokehz ahleyhah.

20:03.577 --> 20:04.544
(growling)

20:04.745 --> 20:05.837
Shmah nah yeshoot...

20:07.373 --> 20:09.171
(chanting in Hebrew)

20:31.897 --> 20:33.365
Bollocks.

20:36.402 --> 20:37.449
(grunts)

21:02.762 --> 21:04.184
How the bloody hell

21:04.388 --> 21:05.981
did a scuzzy little toe rag
like you manage

21:06.182 --> 21:07.650
to capture a thing like that?

21:07.850 --> 21:09.693
What happened?

21:09.894 --> 21:11.521
You Okay?

21:12.646 --> 21:13.989
Are you okay, more like?

21:14.190 --> 21:16.192
I'm fine.

21:17.860 --> 21:19.862
You find it, the demon?

21:20.070 --> 21:23.324
You sure know how
to pick them, Gary.

21:25.075 --> 21:27.328
May be the Rising
Darkness, but, uh,

21:27.536 --> 21:30.210
it's stronger than any hunger
demon I've ever encountered.

21:33.334 --> 21:35.177
(sighs)

21:35.377 --> 21:36.845
I've trapped it for now,

21:37.046 --> 21:38.798
but it'll be loose again
soon enough.

21:39.006 --> 21:41.725
We need to identify it
with absolute certainty

21:41.926 --> 21:42.973
to put it down for good.

21:43.177 --> 21:44.554
You know, maybe...

21:44.762 --> 21:47.356
maybe this will help.

21:52.394 --> 21:54.943
There's no "maybe"
about it, luv.

21:55.147 --> 21:56.364
If they're authentic.

21:56.565 --> 21:58.192
Well, earlier today,

21:58.400 --> 21:59.652
Gary and I, we touched,

21:59.860 --> 22:01.988
and I experienced a...

22:02.196 --> 22:03.743
a psychic transference.

22:03.948 --> 22:05.825
You, uh...

22:06.033 --> 22:07.250
touched?

22:07.451 --> 22:09.203
No. No, no, not like that.

22:09.411 --> 22:11.163
I mean, we only touched
for, like, a second.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.752
But the connection...

22:12.957 --> 22:14.174
it wasn't like
I was just in his head,

22:14.375 --> 22:15.422
'cause it was deeper than that.

22:15.626 --> 22:16.843
I felt his pain

22:17.044 --> 22:18.842
and his guilt

22:19.046 --> 22:20.298
and his addiction.

22:20.506 --> 22:21.678
And after...

22:21.882 --> 22:23.759
His withdrawal symptoms.

22:25.636 --> 22:28.435
You got all the lows
and none of the highs.

22:28.639 --> 22:30.767
Rough deal, I'd say.

22:30.975 --> 22:32.397
It's probably best

22:32.601 --> 22:34.274
if you two kids keep
your hands to yourself.

22:34.478 --> 22:35.695
For now.

22:35.896 --> 22:37.318
All right?

22:39.567 --> 22:41.740
I'm off to see a man
about a dog.

22:43.237 --> 22:47.333
Or, rather, a shaman
about a bloody demon.

22:56.125 --> 22:58.423
##

23:02.590 --> 23:03.682
Not hungry?

23:03.883 --> 23:05.385
Not particularly, mate.

23:05.593 --> 23:06.765
I expected you sooner.

23:06.969 --> 23:09.438
The goat entrails
indicated yesterday

23:09.638 --> 23:10.434
as your time of arrival.

23:10.639 --> 23:12.107
(both laughing)

23:12.308 --> 23:14.231
Well, don't believe
everything you read, Nommo.

23:14.435 --> 23:16.733
Check out today's Inquirer,
and they'll have you

23:16.937 --> 23:18.655
believing a virus
is sweeping the city.

23:18.856 --> 23:20.608
But you know better.

23:20.816 --> 23:21.988
Mm.

23:22.192 --> 23:24.069
Not about most
things, but, uh...

23:24.278 --> 23:26.030
afraid it's less a case of

23:26.238 --> 23:27.455
runny nose,

23:27.656 --> 23:29.249
more a case
of nasty hunger demon.

23:29.450 --> 23:31.794
The problem's contained
for the moment,

23:31.994 --> 23:33.587
but I need answers
to finish it off.

23:36.165 --> 23:38.338
We've traced it back
as far as Sudan,

23:38.542 --> 23:40.795
but we're not sure
if that's where it originated.

23:41.003 --> 23:42.801
Sudan? Mmm.

23:43.005 --> 23:44.348
Khartoum.

23:46.008 --> 23:47.555
Used to call this poor sod home

23:47.760 --> 23:49.353
Before it flew the coop.

23:52.222 --> 23:54.600
Demon you seek
is called Mnemoth.

23:54.767 --> 23:56.815
How do we stop it?

23:57.019 --> 23:58.692
I don't know.

23:58.896 --> 24:00.898
There's a way for us
to discover it together,

24:01.106 --> 24:03.825
but it requires some... travel.

24:06.695 --> 24:09.369
So, by "travel,"
you mean "trip."

24:09.573 --> 24:10.665
A shared vision.

24:10.866 --> 24:11.913
I can guide you through it,

24:12.117 --> 24:13.164
but you need to see it

24:13.369 --> 24:15.337
the way I do, through my eyes.

24:15.537 --> 24:18.461
It's been a while since
I've taken any psychedelics.

24:18.666 --> 24:20.464
Most of them make me puke
these days.

24:23.128 --> 24:24.345
This isn't most psychedelics.

24:24.546 --> 24:25.638
The Mist may well be

24:25.839 --> 24:27.967
the most powerful
drug in the world.

24:28.133 --> 24:30.352
Once taken, its effects
last forever.

24:30.552 --> 24:31.769
(laughs)

24:31.971 --> 24:33.018
Well, you know me...

24:33.222 --> 24:34.474
I'm game for a laugh,

24:34.682 --> 24:37.276
but forever seems
a bit excessive, no?

24:37.476 --> 24:38.602
The Nectar of Nhialic.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.484
A natural counteragent.

24:52.282 --> 24:53.784
Oh... bloody hell.

24:53.993 --> 24:55.540
That is heinous.

24:55.744 --> 24:57.212
An acquired taste, certainly.

24:57.413 --> 24:58.460
So...

24:58.664 --> 25:01.508
if we're tripping balls,

25:01.709 --> 25:03.711
how do we know
to take the nectar?

25:03.919 --> 25:05.887
(laughing)

25:23.272 --> 25:26.151
Call it a hunch, but, uh...

25:26.358 --> 25:29.282
I think this might be working.

25:48.881 --> 25:51.600
NOMMO: Mnemoth has
always been with us.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.723
Through all the famines,

25:53.927 --> 25:55.099
the hunger of
the starving masses

25:55.304 --> 25:57.727
gave the spirit strength.

25:57.931 --> 25:59.183
Nothing could satisfy
the demon's appetite.

25:59.391 --> 26:00.608
After consuming a body,

26:00.809 --> 26:03.153
it moved on to the next,

26:03.353 --> 26:05.196
leaving a growing
trail of death.

26:05.397 --> 26:06.819
The shaman couldn't sit by

26:07.024 --> 26:09.527
and watch his people starve.

26:09.735 --> 26:11.282
He could see what
no one else could.

26:11.487 --> 26:14.036
This was the evil work
of a dark spirit.

26:14.239 --> 26:15.331
He faced

26:15.532 --> 26:16.954
an impossible choice,

26:17.159 --> 26:19.127
for they were all his children.

26:19.328 --> 26:22.252
There was only one way
to stop it.

26:22.456 --> 26:24.879
The demon was invited
to enter the boy

26:25.084 --> 26:27.052
whom the shaman offered
as a sacrifice.

26:28.253 --> 26:30.631
The sacred kusa knife.

26:30.839 --> 26:32.136
Used for the scarification.

26:32.341 --> 26:34.014
Passed down by
generations of shaman,

26:34.218 --> 26:38.189
centuries of powerful magic
contained within.

26:38.388 --> 26:40.265
(screaming)

26:40.474 --> 26:42.852
The tongue had to be removed

26:43.060 --> 26:44.812
so the shaman could not be
cursed for what he did.

26:48.774 --> 26:50.572
The pattern...

26:50.776 --> 26:52.574
had to be precise.

26:52.778 --> 26:54.121
(groaning)

26:54.321 --> 26:55.948
(shaman chanting)

27:04.414 --> 27:06.257
Mnemoth could not resist
the offering.

27:06.458 --> 27:08.210
Upon entering the boy,

27:08.418 --> 27:10.341
it began consuming him,

27:10.546 --> 27:12.014
but as the demon was now
trapped by the containment

27:12.214 --> 27:13.636
markings, the shaman left,

27:13.841 --> 27:15.843
knowing it would ultimately

27:16.051 --> 27:17.894
consume the boy and itself.

27:18.095 --> 27:19.938
(boy groaning)

27:23.308 --> 27:24.400
CONSTANTINE: Decent plan.

27:24.601 --> 27:27.024
Shame it didn't stick.

27:27.229 --> 27:29.152
I mean...

27:29.356 --> 27:31.859
what are the odds
the kid lands himself

27:32.067 --> 27:33.193
in the one bloody alley

27:33.402 --> 27:35.700
that Gary Lester stumbles into?

27:39.908 --> 27:41.785
(Qasps)

27:41.994 --> 27:43.621
Take it slowly, my friend.

27:43.829 --> 27:45.376
Ah, don't worry, mate.

27:45.581 --> 27:47.299
It's not my first disco.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.126
(grunts)

27:49.334 --> 27:51.803
So, the headline here is, uh...

27:52.004 --> 27:54.427
I'm gonna need one of
those fancy blades, right?

27:54.631 --> 27:56.258
The sacred kusa.

27:56.466 --> 27:58.309
Good luck finding one
in this town.

27:58.510 --> 28:02.140
Well, we wouldn't want to make
things easy, now, would we?

28:07.144 --> 28:08.236
I'm sorry, I just...

28:08.437 --> 28:11.486
feel... sort of trapped in here.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.033
Useless.

28:13.233 --> 28:15.577
Just concentrate
on feeling better.

28:15.777 --> 28:17.245
John can handle the rest.

28:17.446 --> 28:19.699
Come on, Gary.

28:19.907 --> 28:21.079
There's nothing for you to do.

28:21.283 --> 28:22.876
I beat that demon once.

28:24.161 --> 28:26.380
I can do it again.

28:28.457 --> 28:30.209
No.

28:31.251 --> 28:33.049
No.

28:34.880 --> 28:35.676
(Qasps)

28:37.633 --> 28:39.556
I didn't want to do this,

28:39.760 --> 28:41.433
but you didn't give me a choice.

28:41.637 --> 28:44.641
It's my fault that
thing's out there.

28:44.848 --> 28:47.271
It's my responsibility
to stop it.

28:47.476 --> 28:49.570
Sorry.

28:49.770 --> 28:51.989
(Zed whimpering)

29:07.204 --> 29:09.753
Zed? Gary?

29:12.292 --> 29:13.589
What'd I tell you two

29:13.794 --> 29:15.467
about keeping your hands
to yourselves?

29:16.964 --> 29:18.841
You're not as funny
as you think.

29:22.970 --> 29:24.472
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Take it easy.

29:24.680 --> 29:26.728
Take it easy.

29:29.726 --> 29:31.319
What happened?

29:34.773 --> 29:36.320
Bastard!

29:36.525 --> 29:37.526
He just...

29:37.734 --> 29:39.532
he just wants to help.

29:39.736 --> 29:41.704
He's so racked with guilt

29:41.905 --> 29:44.624
that he's going after
the demon himself.

29:44.825 --> 29:46.498
Told you that, did he?

29:46.702 --> 29:47.794
Yes, he did.

29:47.995 --> 29:49.918
And he meant it.
'Cause I felt it.

29:50.122 --> 29:52.796
That's not what's happening,
trust me.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.468
Why do you always want to see
the worst in people?

29:54.668 --> 29:57.137
I see the truth.

29:57.337 --> 30:00.341
Gary's hopelessly
addicted to heroin.

30:00.549 --> 30:03.018
And let me give you
a little tip about addicts:

30:03.218 --> 30:05.812
between thought and action
comes temptation.

30:07.055 --> 30:08.648
Always.

30:08.849 --> 30:10.692
(man grunting in pain)

30:14.271 --> 30:16.023
Ooh, nice one, lads.

30:16.231 --> 30:17.608
Think ljust heard a rib crack.

30:17.816 --> 30:18.942
Oh, no, no, no, no.

30:19.151 --> 30:20.653
Don't stop on my account.

30:20.861 --> 30:22.704
In fact, maybe I can help.

30:24.781 --> 30:26.954
I'm guessing that this
little misunderstanding

30:27.159 --> 30:28.877
has something to do with the
purchase of narcotics, correct?

30:30.912 --> 30:33.756
Best high you'll ever have.

30:34.708 --> 30:35.755
On my life.

30:41.131 --> 30:43.975
Must be getting soft.

30:44.176 --> 30:45.723
Should've let those two
keep going on you.

30:45.927 --> 30:46.974
Get you out of my hair

30:47.179 --> 30:48.726
for good.

30:48.930 --> 30:50.557
So why didn't you?

30:50.766 --> 30:52.439
(laughs)

30:52.642 --> 30:54.360
You are a massive pain
in the arse, Gary Lester.

30:55.812 --> 30:58.406
But you're still my mate.

30:58.607 --> 31:00.154
More's the pity.

31:01.985 --> 31:03.987
Friends don't betray each other.

31:08.658 --> 31:09.875
I betrayed you.

31:11.453 --> 31:13.000
I betrayed her.

31:13.205 --> 31:14.377
Oh, don't worry about Zed.

31:14.581 --> 31:15.707
She's a tough bird, that one.

31:15.916 --> 31:17.463
I'm talking about Astra.

31:24.841 --> 31:27.094
There's something
I need to tell you, John.

31:29.054 --> 31:30.180
About Newcastle.

31:31.807 --> 31:32.808
Gaz, you don't...

31:33.016 --> 31:34.063
Please.

31:35.394 --> 31:37.237
I need to say this.

31:39.981 --> 31:41.858
I was high.

31:43.402 --> 31:45.279
Been smoking all clay.

31:47.489 --> 31:50.242
By the time
the séance started...

31:50.450 --> 31:52.373
(scoffs)

31:52.577 --> 31:55.171
I was well caned.

31:55.372 --> 31:57.841
And then, when...

31:58.041 --> 32:01.762
everything started
going pear-shaped...

32:01.920 --> 32:03.342
I hid.

32:07.467 --> 32:09.890
Under a bed in a room upstairs.

32:10.095 --> 32:12.348
Her screams...

32:12.556 --> 32:14.399
I can still hear them, John.

32:14.599 --> 32:16.818
She was being dragged to Hell.

32:18.520 --> 32:20.568
Ijust laid there in
me own stinkin' piss,

32:20.772 --> 32:23.901
closed me eyes,
covered me ears...

32:24.109 --> 32:25.827
and when it was all done...

32:27.904 --> 32:30.157
I ran.

32:33.201 --> 32:36.922
John?

32:37.122 --> 32:40.376
Say something, please.

32:40.584 --> 32:43.178
Wasn't your fault, mate.

32:43.378 --> 32:46.507
Should've never gotten
you all involved.

32:46.715 --> 32:48.467
You, especially.

32:48.633 --> 32:50.101
Because I'm a coward.

32:50.302 --> 32:52.054
Because it's not your world.

32:52.262 --> 32:54.731
Never was and I knew it.

32:54.931 --> 32:57.730
And I knew you were high.

32:57.934 --> 33:00.278
We all did.

33:00.479 --> 33:02.948
The thing is, Gaz...

33:03.148 --> 33:05.446
I don't blame you.

33:05.650 --> 33:08.870
I never did.

33:09.070 --> 33:11.664
You had every right
to be afraid.

33:14.826 --> 33:16.169
And you know
what I always say, Gaz?

33:18.079 --> 33:21.299
Everyone has
the capacity to change.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.719
I've never heard
you say that before.

33:23.919 --> 33:26.513
Exactly.

33:29.382 --> 33:30.884
WOMAN (on television): We're
live outside the Fox Theater

33:31.092 --> 33:33.015
in mid-town Atlanta,
which is now on lockdown,

33:33.220 --> 33:35.689
following reports
of another virus outbreak.

33:35.889 --> 33:39.063
Get it in you, mate.

33:40.393 --> 33:41.861
We've got a demon to catch.

33:42.020 --> 33:44.739
Together.

33:54.908 --> 33:56.125
Nothing too elaborate.

33:56.326 --> 33:59.296
Just a simple distraction.

34:00.914 --> 34:02.757
Then what?

34:02.958 --> 34:05.336
Then you break in
and steal the bloody kusa knife.

34:05.544 --> 34:07.888
It's not rocket surgery.

34:08.088 --> 34:09.304
Me?

34:09.505 --> 34:11.474
Are you sure?

34:11.675 --> 34:14.895
All the faith in
the world, old son.

34:15.094 --> 34:17.688
Now, you might
want to stand back.

34:19.306 --> 34:20.900
(yells)

34:22.686 --> 34:24.938
(quiet laugh)

34:32.654 --> 34:35.032
You sure you really want
to go through with this?

34:35.239 --> 34:36.708
It's just a bit of glass.

34:36.908 --> 34:38.534
It's easy to replace.

34:38.743 --> 34:40.495
That's not
what I'm talking about.

34:40.704 --> 34:42.502
And you know it.

34:45.958 --> 34:47.960
I can do this.

34:56.553 --> 34:58.521
(alarm ringing)

34:58.722 --> 35:00.099
Right.

35:01.766 --> 35:03.609
I'm off then.

35:03.768 --> 35:04.769
You there! Stop!

35:04.978 --> 35:05.979
(Qfoans)

35:06.187 --> 35:08.030
Stop where you are!

35:35.634 --> 35:37.136
Very nice.

35:37.344 --> 35:39.438
And now let's see a plié.

35:39.638 --> 35:42.232
Oh, I think I saw that left heel

35:42.432 --> 35:44.480
wobble a bit, otherwise perfect.

35:44.684 --> 35:47.563
Now, uh... express yourself.

35:47.771 --> 35:49.819
How long's he gonna
be under for?

35:50.023 --> 35:52.025
Until the music stops.

35:53.818 --> 35:56.697
The alarm.

35:56.905 --> 35:59.249
How'd you fare?

36:02.577 --> 36:05.672
Attaboy.

36:05.872 --> 36:06.873
I knew I could count on you.

36:07.082 --> 36:08.629
Come on.

36:10.460 --> 36:12.337
Watch that left heel.

36:24.724 --> 36:27.102
(indistinct chatter)

36:28.353 --> 36:30.230
Oh, sorry.

36:32.023 --> 36:33.946
Impressive.

36:34.150 --> 36:35.402
Should be.

36:35.610 --> 36:37.453
Learned from the best.

36:54.379 --> 36:57.303
By the look on that bloke,
time's not on our side.

36:57.507 --> 36:58.759
The demon will be out of him,

36:58.967 --> 37:00.389
looking for his
next victim soon.

37:00.552 --> 37:01.974
We need to get started.

37:02.178 --> 37:03.270
(growling)

37:06.015 --> 37:07.187
So, what's the plan then?

37:07.392 --> 37:09.144
This demon requires a sacrifice.

37:09.352 --> 37:11.650
That's what I learned
from the shaman.

37:11.855 --> 37:14.859
No cage, bottle
or vessel can hold it.

37:15.066 --> 37:17.114
Only a body.

37:17.318 --> 37:19.946
A live, human...

37:20.155 --> 37:21.657
body.

37:24.159 --> 37:25.411
Mine.

37:27.287 --> 37:30.086
We could draw straws.

37:33.376 --> 37:36.346
It was your plan all
along, wasn't it?

37:44.763 --> 37:47.892
That's why it's
just you and me here.

37:48.099 --> 37:49.567
(possessed man growling)

37:56.399 --> 37:58.697
You sneaky bastard.

38:02.280 --> 38:04.123
My chance...

38:04.324 --> 38:07.498
to finally make
my life mean something.

38:09.162 --> 38:11.039
It won't be quick.

38:11.247 --> 38:13.170
Could take days of sheer agony

38:13.374 --> 38:15.877
before you die.

38:16.085 --> 38:18.087
And there's no going back.

38:18.296 --> 38:20.469
Do you understand?

38:24.302 --> 38:27.681
There's no better way to go out.

38:29.224 --> 38:30.726
A mage.

38:30.934 --> 38:34.188
Like John Constantine.

38:39.275 --> 38:41.573
I'm proud of you, Gaz.

38:43.279 --> 38:45.327
Truly.

38:56.417 --> 38:58.590
Let's do this.

39:04.801 --> 39:07.179

39:22.110 --> 39:24.613

Well done there, mate!

40:17.665 --> 40:19.087
Not long now.

40:19.292 --> 40:21.465
(Gary screaming)

40:23.379 --> 40:25.882
(grunting)

40:51.908 --> 40:53.910
He's coming around.

40:54.118 --> 40:55.540
We need to get him inside
and into a secure room.

40:55.745 --> 40:56.712
You put the demon inside of him?

40:56.913 --> 40:57.914
There was no other way.

40:58.122 --> 41:00.545
You're sacrificing him, you're
sacrificing your friend's life.

41:00.750 --> 41:02.127
It was his choice.
And it was a brave one.

41:02.335 --> 41:03.302
You need to respect that.

41:03.503 --> 41:04.880
You manipulated him.

41:05.088 --> 41:06.214
You tricked him into it.

41:06.422 --> 41:07.890
That demon was
one of the most powerful

41:08.091 --> 41:09.468
and malevolent entities
I've ever come across.

41:09.676 --> 41:11.223
What we did saved
countless lives!

41:11.427 --> 41:12.474
I don't care!

41:12.679 --> 41:14.101
Gary loved you,
and you betrayed him!

41:14.305 --> 41:16.103
All he cared about
was to make you proud.

41:16.307 --> 41:18.526
And for what, John, huh?

41:18.726 --> 41:20.228
He wanted to be just like you.
Thank God he's not!

41:20.436 --> 41:21.358
He came to me!

41:23.481 --> 41:25.233
You think I wanted this?

41:25.441 --> 41:26.442
Any of it?

41:26.651 --> 41:29.279
I told you this would happen.

41:29.487 --> 41:31.865
People around me die.

41:33.282 --> 41:35.330
If you can't handle it, then go.

41:41.624 --> 41:43.467
Which room
do you want to put him in?

41:43.668 --> 41:46.342
Downstairs.

41:46.546 --> 41:48.344
End of the hallway.

41:50.883 --> 41:52.931
(Gary screaming)
