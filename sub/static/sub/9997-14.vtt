WEBVTT

00:05.600 --> 00:07.410
Happy birthday, baby.

00:11.460 --> 00:13.000
Donald, honey?

00:13.870 --> 00:14.420
Get up.

00:16.290 --> 00:17.760
It's dinnertime, sweetie.

00:18.830 --> 00:20.440
I sent the staff home early.

00:20.550 --> 00:22.710
I thought maybe we could celebrate your birthday alone.

00:23.330 --> 00:24.230
Wonderful.

00:24.710 --> 00:26.660
There's food and champagne downstairs.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.630
But if you want to make a wish

00:28.720 --> 00:30.270
and blow out your candles right here...

00:31.060 --> 00:35.080
What do I have to wish for when I've already got you?

00:35.360 --> 00:36.770
Oh, that's sweet, honey.

00:37.240 --> 00:39.030
But the wax is dripping onto the cake.

00:41.000 --> 00:47.074

00:50.540 --> 00:52.850
Ooh, look at you in that dress.

00:53.780 --> 00:56.560
What I wouldn't give to be 20 years younger.

00:59.220 --> 01:00.310
Try 60.

01:05.760 --> 01:07.220
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

01:07.630 --> 01:10.140
I had a call from Dr. Carroll today.

01:10.560 --> 01:12.060
He told me that the last

01:12.140 --> 01:15.290
of the malignant cells in my prostate are gone.

01:15.920 --> 01:17.360
It's a miracle, he said.

01:17.520 --> 01:20.090
Someone my age, making a full recovery.

01:21.530 --> 01:23.170
A full recovery? Yeah.

01:24.360 --> 01:27.860
So... there's no chance the cancer's coming back?

01:28.250 --> 01:29.600
Carroll didn't think so.

01:30.120 --> 01:32.070
You know what I think made me better?

01:32.690 --> 01:33.350
You.

01:33.770 --> 01:35.810
It helps to have a young wife.

01:36.350 --> 01:38.710
Who knows, the way I feel now,

01:40.340 --> 01:42.610
I might just push for 100!

01:46.440 --> 01:47.570
Sweetie pie, what are you doing?

01:48.020 --> 01:49.460
I thought we were going downstairs.

01:49.820 --> 01:51.590
We are. You are.

01:52.250 --> 01:53.160
I'm sorry, Donnie.

01:53.600 --> 01:55.050
But this isn't what I signed up for.

01:55.470 --> 01:56.890
You weren't supposed to live this long.

02:20.080 --> 02:21.530
Oh, my God.

02:27.240 --> 02:29.070
Why won't you die already?

02:34.960 --> 02:36.920
No.

03:12.820 --> 03:18.130
medium 614

03:24.900 --> 03:26.650
...following a one-day adjournment,

03:26.790 --> 03:27.980
court will resume this afternoon

03:28.060 --> 03:29.930
in the Mallory Kessinger trial.

03:30.310 --> 03:32.540
Kessinger, as virtually every news outlet

03:32.630 --> 03:33.900
in the country will tell you,

03:34.170 --> 03:37.060
stands accused of murdering her billionaire husband,

03:37.260 --> 03:39.530
J. Donald Kessinger, last August.

03:39.670 --> 03:43.360
Come on, would you marry that guy for a billion dollars?

03:43.900 --> 03:46.530
Would anyone marry that guy for a billion dollars?

03:46.720 --> 03:48.830
Okay, enough talking, not enough eating.

03:49.020 --> 03:51.060
Come on, guys. We're leaving in ten minutes.

03:51.380 --> 03:52.930
Mommy's got a meeting with the district attorney,

03:52.940 --> 03:53.820
and I can't be late.

03:54.100 --> 03:55.140
Yeah, almost forgot.

03:55.250 --> 03:56.390
I won't be home for dinner tonight.

03:56.480 --> 03:57.960
I'm babysitting. For the Quinlans?

03:58.160 --> 03:59.270
A friend of theirs.

03:59.850 --> 04:01.570
Her name is, uh, Dr. Behrend.

04:02.490 --> 04:03.820
I think she's a therapist or something.

04:04.310 --> 04:07.410
And according to Mrs. Quinlan, if I do a good job,

04:07.500 --> 04:09.950
this could turn into a regular thing.

04:10.330 --> 04:11.800
Well, make sure we have her information.

04:12.130 --> 04:14.160
Name, address, phone number.

04:14.320 --> 04:15.830
And if I'm there past 8:00, I'll call.

04:17.350 --> 04:18.390
...to murder her husband.

04:18.390 --> 04:21.240
This video footage was taken while Mallory Kessinger

04:21.370 --> 04:23.040
was vacationing in St. Bart's

04:23.310 --> 04:25.530
just one week after her husband's death.

04:28.000 --> 04:28.660
What?

04:30.250 --> 04:32.040
I'm taking an interest in your work.

04:47.210 --> 04:49.230
Uh, I'm guessing this is yours?

04:50.750 --> 04:51.560
Oh, thanks.

04:52.800 --> 04:53.950
That kind of morning, you know?

04:54.320 --> 04:56.070
I finally get an interview with the city planning department

04:56.170 --> 04:57.980
and the lock on my briefcase gives.

04:58.480 --> 04:59.570
Here's hoping I find the paper

04:59.640 --> 05:01.540
that told me what floor I'm supposed to go to.

05:01.730 --> 05:03.530
Well, I'm heading that way. I could show you.

05:04.110 --> 05:07.100
Oh, thanks, but I think I still have some things

05:07.170 --> 05:08.060
I have to collect.

05:08.920 --> 05:10.100
Maybe, if I'm very lucky,

05:10.220 --> 05:12.150
I won't have to crawl under any cars to get them.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.280
Wow, how did you beat me up here?

05:21.510 --> 05:22.760
And what happened to your vest?

05:23.440 --> 05:25.690
Oh, don't tell me you had to crawl under those cars.

05:30.180 --> 05:31.760
Manny, I'm only interested

05:31.830 --> 05:32.890
in what's best for my client

05:32.960 --> 05:34.060
and what's best for my client

05:34.130 --> 05:35.810
is for this whole ordeal to be over.

05:37.140 --> 05:39.000
In fact, nothing would please Mrs. Kessinger more

05:39.120 --> 05:40.660
than to be able to get on with the business

05:40.750 --> 05:42.510
of grieving for her husband.

05:43.550 --> 05:44.190
Hmm.

05:44.590 --> 05:46.170
I'm sure she also wouldn't mind

05:46.280 --> 05:48.540
getting her hands on the inheritance as well.

05:48.860 --> 05:50.370
Well, since you mention it,

05:51.400 --> 05:54.290
the fact that her assets are frozen while she's on trial

05:54.430 --> 05:56.690
has proven to be an additional hardship.

05:58.120 --> 06:00.350
But look, we've both been in that courtroom

06:00.450 --> 06:01.480
for more than a week now.

06:01.660 --> 06:04.190
We've both seen the way the jury is looking at my client.

06:04.340 --> 06:05.570
They're captivated by her.

06:06.130 --> 06:07.500
They're not going to send her to prison.

06:08.120 --> 06:09.040
Face it, Manny.

06:09.900 --> 06:11.330
It's time to cut your losses.

06:12.240 --> 06:13.040
Make a deal.

06:13.570 --> 06:15.820
If your offer does not include

06:15.910 --> 06:17.340
the charge of first-degree murder,

06:17.410 --> 06:18.830
we don't have anything to talk about.

06:19.060 --> 06:20.330
Come on, Manny.

06:20.460 --> 06:22.510
There are no witnesses to this so-called murder.

06:22.790 --> 06:25.090
Your whole case comes down to some forensics guy

06:25.160 --> 06:26.080
who's willing to testify

06:26.140 --> 06:28.070
the blow to the head of Mr. Kessinger

06:28.210 --> 06:32.120
was not the result of his unfortunate fall down the stairs.

06:32.240 --> 06:32.780
Well, guess what?

06:32.850 --> 06:34.100
I got a forensics guy, too.

06:34.450 --> 06:36.160
And he's gonna say the exact opposite.

06:36.500 --> 06:37.890
I'll take my chances. Really?

06:38.680 --> 06:40.480
Are you that sure you're in the catbird seat here?

06:41.490 --> 06:42.860
I mean, I haven't put Mallory

06:42.950 --> 06:43.840
on the stand yet.

06:44.030 --> 06:45.170
When I do, believe me,

06:45.610 --> 06:47.610
the jury will see that she was the very definition

06:47.680 --> 06:48.780
of a loving wife.

06:49.460 --> 06:52.650
She gave Donald Kessinger the best 14 months of his life.

06:52.940 --> 06:54.340
Fourteen and a half.

06:55.790 --> 06:56.410
Uh-huh.

06:57.800 --> 06:58.300
All right,

07:00.060 --> 07:01.730
sorry we couldn't work anything out.

07:03.460 --> 07:04.380
I'll see you back in court.

07:07.310 --> 07:08.450
Impressions?

07:08.460 --> 07:11.050
???aa

07:11.070 --> 07:14.030
I mean, I think if he was 40 years older

07:14.300 --> 07:15.770
and a billion dollars richer,

07:15.860 --> 07:17.540
they would make a perfect couple.

07:19.840 --> 07:20.470
Sir...

07:23.170 --> 07:24.760
What is that man doing in your office?

07:25.100 --> 07:26.160
Oh, him?

07:26.270 --> 07:28.130
He's tech support. Apparently, there's

07:28.220 --> 07:29.600
some sort of glitch in the municipal mainframe

07:29.610 --> 07:30.960
that's got a lot of the computers

07:30.970 --> 07:32.420
in the building acting buggy.

07:32.990 --> 07:33.530
Why?

07:33.810 --> 07:36.300
Because I ran into him this morning in the parking garage.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.580
You know, he told me that he was interviewing for a job

07:38.670 --> 07:40.160
with the city planning department.

07:41.810 --> 07:43.660
Okay, so, maybe he was.

07:45.040 --> 07:46.210
Yeah, but he keeps changing his clothes.

07:46.280 --> 07:48.090
That's the third outfit I've seen him in today.

07:49.550 --> 07:51.440
Uh, there's no law against that.

07:55.670 --> 07:56.570
Yeah, but it's weird.

07:57.370 --> 07:59.550
Okay, let's see, uh...

08:00.420 --> 08:01.340
What else?

08:01.640 --> 08:02.700
You've got all my numbers.

08:02.830 --> 08:05.530
You know when and what Jeb's supposed to eat.

08:06.430 --> 08:09.370
Uh, I think we've pretty much covered it all.

08:09.740 --> 08:12.470
You have nothing to worry about, Dr. Behrend.

08:12.560 --> 08:13.750
Jeb is in good hands.

08:14.880 --> 08:16.670
Real quick, uh, before I go,

08:17.040 --> 08:19.960
in the interest of full disclosure, Jeb can be

08:20.120 --> 08:21.480
a little bit of a handful.

08:21.630 --> 08:23.560
Especially when it comes to sitters.

08:23.790 --> 08:25.260
And that's why I'm going to pay you double

08:25.370 --> 08:26.550
whatever the Quinlans pay you.

08:27.610 --> 08:29.850
Wow, um, okay.

08:30.020 --> 08:33.090
But Jeb doesn't look like a handful at all.

08:33.840 --> 08:35.049
Yeah, don't fall for that.

08:35.200 --> 08:35.960
He'll eat you alive.

08:36.580 --> 08:37.289
Seriously?

08:38.080 --> 08:39.370
Just keep an eye on him.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.559
Oh, and if he does do something bad,

08:41.650 --> 08:44.230
do not let him convince you that it was Mr. Teefers.

08:45.680 --> 08:47.750
He's Jeb's imaginary friend.

08:47.840 --> 08:48.780
He's a beaver.

08:48.960 --> 08:51.090
About yea high, big teeth.

08:51.320 --> 08:53.300
He gets blamed for a lot around here, if you know what I mean.

08:53.770 --> 08:54.570
Isn't that right, Jebby?

08:58.380 --> 08:58.890
Anyway.

08:59.090 --> 09:00.200
I'll be gone a few hours,

09:00.270 --> 09:01.750
and you have my cell phone if you need me, okay?

09:03.050 --> 09:03.560
Okay.

09:10.460 --> 09:11.310
Bye-bye, sweetheart.

09:12.350 --> 09:14.540
Be a good boy for Mama, okay?

09:15.630 --> 09:16.820
She's begging you.

09:28.650 --> 09:30.500
So, Jeb. What do you, uh...

09:30.930 --> 09:33.150
what do you say we play outside before it gets too dark?

09:35.180 --> 09:35.850
What do you say?

09:40.500 --> 09:42.380
What was that, Mr. Teefers?

09:42.930 --> 09:44.310
You think that sounds like a lot of fun?

09:45.990 --> 09:47.040
He's not there.

09:47.930 --> 09:48.750
He's not?

09:50.260 --> 09:51.360
Well, then, where is he?

10:06.620 --> 10:07.790
Did you hear anything at work

10:07.890 --> 10:09.230
about our voting district changing?

10:09.630 --> 10:10.450
No, why?

10:10.730 --> 10:12.850
I got an e-mail from the city that says it moved.

10:13.530 --> 10:15.680
Sort of a weird time of the year to tell us, though.

10:16.150 --> 10:17.670
I mean, there's not gonna be another election

10:17.750 --> 10:18.890
for what, ten months?

10:18.990 --> 10:20.400
Well, Devalos mentioned something about

10:20.460 --> 10:23.360
there being a glitch in the municipal mainframe today.

10:23.510 --> 10:25.910
Maybe that e-mail went out before it was supposed to.

10:26.090 --> 10:27.950
Oh, shoot, my computer's about to die.

10:28.400 --> 10:30.290
I'm still downloading these specs from Keith.

10:30.350 --> 10:31.360
Could you grab my power cord?

10:31.920 --> 10:34.120
It's in the dining room in my briefcase.

10:52.230 --> 10:53.710
Honey, honey, can you come here now?!

10:57.630 --> 10:58.810
What's going on? There's a man outside.

10:59.100 --> 11:01.130
He's walking a dog. He's wearing a dress.

11:01.940 --> 11:02.900
I think he's following me.

11:03.650 --> 11:04.930
I saw him three times at work today.

11:05.240 --> 11:06.900
Each time he was wearing something different.

11:07.150 --> 11:07.830
Different dress?

11:08.220 --> 11:10.180
No. It's the first time I've seen him in a dress.

11:10.510 --> 11:11.450
The dress thing is new.

11:12.030 --> 11:13.330
I don't know what to tell you.

11:13.920 --> 11:15.800
Maybe he's changing into a pantsuit or something.

11:16.050 --> 11:16.720
Look, I'm telling you.

11:16.820 --> 11:18.140
There was a man out there.

11:18.480 --> 11:20.580
He was walking a dog and wearing a dress.

11:20.950 --> 11:22.360
He's been following me all day.

11:22.540 --> 11:24.380
Allison, you work for the district attorney's office.

11:24.450 --> 11:26.310
It's not like anybody can just wander around in there.

11:26.450 --> 11:28.320
Well, this guy does. Sort of.

11:28.380 --> 11:30.230
I mean, he fixes computers or something.

11:30.380 --> 11:31.790
Well, so he's not really a stranger.

11:32.090 --> 11:34.330
I mean, I-I bet if you ask around work tomorrow

11:34.400 --> 11:35.880
you can probably find out who he is.

11:35.880 --> 11:36.390
I guess so.

11:36.390 --> 11:37.980
But I've never seen him before today.

11:38.250 --> 11:40.090
Well, for all we know, he could live in the neighborhood.

11:40.210 --> 11:41.220
I mean, maybe you seeing him now,

11:41.300 --> 11:42.700
that could just be a big coincidence.

11:42.830 --> 11:44.290
No. Maybe.

11:44.530 --> 11:45.480
I don't know. It's dark.

11:45.570 --> 11:47.740
It's a pretty good distance from here to the sidewalk.

11:48.110 --> 11:50.190
You know, maybe he's wearing a billowy coat or something

11:50.250 --> 11:51.780
and your eyes are playing tricks on you.

11:51.920 --> 11:52.870
A billowy coat?

11:53.450 --> 11:54.870
I'm just trying to find a logical explanation

11:54.930 --> 11:56.940
so I back to checking my e-mail. Your e-mail.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.280
Okay, go back and check your e-mail.

12:19.390 --> 12:20.810
Please, don't do this!

12:21.030 --> 12:21.930
You've gotta believe me.

12:21.980 --> 12:22.770
I'm begging you.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.550
I didn't take anything

12:24.750 --> 12:25.410
from you!

12:25.820 --> 12:27.950
I'm just as much a victim in this as you are!

12:28.810 --> 12:30.160
I'm going to ask you just one more time.

12:30.540 --> 12:31.710
You tell me what I want to hear,

12:31.810 --> 12:33.820
and you come out of this with nothing more than a severe limp.

12:34.240 --> 12:36.820
Where is my money?

12:37.390 --> 12:38.210
Please, Charlie.

12:38.510 --> 12:39.330
I didn't take it.

12:39.590 --> 12:41.710
I'd give you my own money, but that's all gone, too!

12:42.430 --> 12:44.000
Please. You have to believe me.

12:44.220 --> 12:45.420
I'm begging you, please.

12:46.040 --> 12:47.650
I got good news for you, old buddy.

12:48.120 --> 12:49.280
Looks like you're not going to have to worry

12:49.370 --> 12:50.300
about that limp after all.

12:54.520 --> 12:55.300
Charlie...

12:56.330 --> 12:57.290
You okay?

12:57.830 --> 12:59.720
Yeah, just a weird dream.

12:59.920 --> 13:02.670
That guy that I saw outside the window was in it.

13:03.960 --> 13:04.780
Wait a second.

13:04.880 --> 13:06.470
Now you're dreaming about this guy?

13:07.430 --> 13:07.960
Mmm.

13:09.420 --> 13:12.910
Al, please, for your sake, for my sake...

13:13.720 --> 13:15.980
you gotta find a way to get this guy out of your head.

13:16.290 --> 13:19.480
Al, what the hell are you doing?

13:20.680 --> 13:21.470
Where's my husband?

13:21.970 --> 13:24.130
What did you with him? Al, your husband?

13:24.210 --> 13:25.450
What the hell are you talking about?

13:25.520 --> 13:27.130
Where is he?! Tell me where he is now!

13:27.770 --> 13:28.290
Mom?

13:29.650 --> 13:30.750
What do you think you're doing?

13:30.810 --> 13:32.260
Why are you pointing that at Dad?

13:32.370 --> 13:32.950
Step back.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.250
Ariel, look at him.

13:34.560 --> 13:36.090
This man is not your father.

13:36.350 --> 13:37.290
Dad, what is she talking about?

13:37.400 --> 13:38.630
Why is she acting this way?

13:38.980 --> 13:41.290
No, Mommy! I don't care if you guys are fighting.

13:41.350 --> 13:43.170
You can't hurt Daddy.

13:43.400 --> 13:44.290
I don't understand.

13:44.500 --> 13:46.260
Why are you protecting this man?

13:46.620 --> 13:48.150
Why do you keep calling him Daddy?

13:48.830 --> 13:52.510
Because that's who he is: our dad,

13:52.670 --> 13:54.870
and we're not going to let you hurt him.

14:04.050 --> 14:05.710
It wasn't easy, but everyone's calmed down

14:05.800 --> 14:07.010
and getting ready for school.

14:07.190 --> 14:09.390
The official story is, you had a whopper of a nightmare

14:09.480 --> 14:10.750
and woke up pretty confused.

14:15.550 --> 14:16.100
Okay.

14:17.620 --> 14:18.730
Once more with feeling.

14:20.900 --> 14:22.290
My name is Joe Dubois.

14:22.450 --> 14:23.680
You and I got married on the beach

14:23.750 --> 14:25.720
in San Luis Obispo, California.

14:25.920 --> 14:26.720
It was beautiful,

14:26.940 --> 14:28.840
even though it happened a day after it was supposed to.

14:29.510 --> 14:32.480
We tell people that's probably the weekend Ariel was conceived,

14:32.750 --> 14:34.570
although we both know you were about five weeks pregnant

14:34.570 --> 14:35.470
when we got married.

14:36.800 --> 14:39.230
For the last time, Al, I'm your husband.

14:39.930 --> 14:43.360
When our daughters look at me, they see your husband.

14:45.650 --> 14:47.500
Something's going on with you, obviously.

14:48.730 --> 14:50.330
It might be obvious to you, but...

14:51.990 --> 14:52.610
Joe...

14:54.140 --> 14:56.400
when I look at you, I still just see a stranger.

14:57.030 --> 14:57.600
Okay.

14:57.940 --> 14:59.500
Well, is he better-looking than the real me?

15:00.310 --> 15:01.170
It's not funny.

15:03.220 --> 15:04.520
What are you doing anyway?

15:04.690 --> 15:05.550
What does it look like I'm doing?

15:05.630 --> 15:06.600
I'm getting on with my day.

15:07.360 --> 15:08.780
Look, this is definitely weird.

15:08.870 --> 15:10.470
But you're not in danger.

15:11.280 --> 15:12.320
And now that you aren't pointing

15:12.390 --> 15:14.890
a pair of scissors at me anymore, I'm not in danger.

15:14.970 --> 15:17.320
So let's just ride it out.

15:21.090 --> 15:23.820
Temperature's up to an unseasonably warm 78 degrees.

15:23.930 --> 15:26.590
So you can leave your jackets at home today, folks.

15:26.700 --> 15:27.290
Dan?

15:28.670 --> 15:29.450
Thanks, Ted.

15:29.610 --> 15:31.380
The governor returned to Phoenix today,

15:31.440 --> 15:33.520
insisting that his trip to Washington doesn't mean

15:33.580 --> 15:35.500
he's interested in a run at a higher office...

15:35.660 --> 15:37.130
Okay, those guys on TV right now--

15:37.770 --> 15:38.720
they both look like you.

15:40.170 --> 15:42.100
All those people that I saw yesterday,

15:42.850 --> 15:44.900
they all look exactly like you do now.

15:46.010 --> 15:48.360
I mean, I know I wasn't looking at the same guy.

15:48.430 --> 15:49.450
They were different people.

15:49.550 --> 15:51.900
I just... I just couldn't recognize them

15:51.970 --> 15:52.880
for who they were.

15:53.420 --> 15:54.790
So, everyone looks like me?

15:54.790 --> 15:55.900
Like this to you now?

15:56.230 --> 15:57.400
Well, no, not everyone.

15:57.930 --> 15:59.020
No, not the girls.

15:59.120 --> 16:00.300
Not my boss.

16:00.790 --> 16:02.730
Not that lawyer I met with yesterday.

16:03.640 --> 16:04.330
I don't get it.

16:04.410 --> 16:05.990
Why do some people look different

16:06.690 --> 16:07.580
and some people don't?

16:08.960 --> 16:09.830
In other news,

16:09.920 --> 16:11.580
the corpse of an apparent murder victim

16:11.630 --> 16:13.060
was found in a patch of forest near Chandler

16:13.140 --> 16:14.880
that's being cleared for a housing development.

16:15.480 --> 16:17.230
Authorities have yet to identify the man,

16:17.470 --> 16:18.990
but evidence at the scene suggests

16:19.080 --> 16:21.570
that he was chased through the woods and shot several times.

16:22.310 --> 16:25.040
Oh, my God, I had a dream about that murder last night.

16:25.770 --> 16:27.080
Oh, yeah? Did you see the guy who did it?

16:27.780 --> 16:29.150
Yeah, I saw him as clear as day.

16:29.230 --> 16:30.060
I saw the victim, too.

16:32.680 --> 16:33.350
They both looked...

16:34.900 --> 16:35.780
a lot like you.

16:51.140 --> 16:53.230
The body appears to have been shot several times.

16:53.480 --> 16:56.130
It was found early this morning by an indigent man.

16:56.460 --> 16:57.990
It was about 6:00 a.M.

16:59.450 --> 17:01.100
He was out walking his dog...

17:11.300 --> 17:12.210
Hey, what are you doing here?

17:12.450 --> 17:13.380
Lee, is that you?

17:15.569 --> 17:17.980
Uh, yeah, is there someone else you think I might be?

17:20.180 --> 17:20.880
Just don't worry about it.

17:20.950 --> 17:22.430
I'm just having a very weird morning.

17:23.760 --> 17:24.450
This murder--

17:25.770 --> 17:27.079
I dreamt about it last night--

17:27.690 --> 17:28.319
sort of.

17:29.090 --> 17:29.690
Okay.

17:30.090 --> 17:31.710
We know the victim's name is Peter Musgrove,

17:31.800 --> 17:33.030
but if you happened to get a look at the shooter...

17:33.660 --> 17:35.210
I did and I didn't.

17:35.530 --> 17:37.840
But I actually saw some things I think could be useful.

17:39.110 --> 17:40.630
The victim and the murderer knew each other.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.750
They-they were arguing about money.

17:43.130 --> 17:43.960
And the guy who got shot

17:44.130 --> 17:45.420
kept calling the other guy Charlie.

17:45.720 --> 17:47.190
Charlie. That's a start.

17:47.670 --> 17:48.320
Anything else?

17:50.410 --> 17:52.560
Nothing that-that you could use.

17:53.290 --> 17:54.900
Peter! Peter!

17:55.680 --> 17:56.770
Peter!

18:00.420 --> 18:01.930
We I.D.'d the victim from a fingerprint check.

18:02.120 --> 18:03.080
Looks like his wife just got here.

18:04.000 --> 18:04.770
Handsome woman.

18:06.720 --> 18:08.470
Hey, Jeb, do you want your sandwich cut in half

18:08.550 --> 18:09.340
or just regular?

18:10.180 --> 18:11.660
Cut in half, please.

18:13.120 --> 18:15.120
One late afternoon snack coming right up.

18:16.730 --> 18:17.790
Oh, my God, what are you doing?!

18:17.840 --> 18:18.960
That's my history book!

18:21.070 --> 18:23.290
My take-home quiz-- you ruined it!

18:29.110 --> 18:30.540
MAN : Doesn't it just break your heart?

18:31.990 --> 18:33.880
Deep down he wants to be good,

18:34.160 --> 18:37.270
but he just can't help himself sometimes.

18:37.910 --> 18:38.810
You scared me.

18:41.510 --> 18:42.590
You're still scaring me.

18:43.460 --> 18:44.080
Yeah, well...

18:46.010 --> 18:47.890
you scared me yesterday, so I guess we're even.

18:49.630 --> 18:50.470
I scared you?

18:50.850 --> 18:51.390
Sure.

18:51.730 --> 18:53.880
I'm not used to anyone but Jeb being able to see me,

18:53.960 --> 18:55.800
so I guess you're, uh, special

18:56.090 --> 18:56.780
like he is.

18:57.720 --> 18:58.440
Who are you?

18:59.220 --> 18:59.950
Who do you think I am?

19:01.020 --> 19:01.740
I don't know.

19:03.420 --> 19:05.220
Some dead guy in a beaver costume?

19:05.970 --> 19:07.210
Not just any dead guy

19:07.270 --> 19:08.210
in a beaver costume.

19:09.260 --> 19:11.230
You ever hear of Ashmore University?

19:11.940 --> 19:13.010
Yeah. You ever watch

19:13.020 --> 19:14.570
one of their football games on TV?

19:14.760 --> 19:16.400
The Beavers-- the Ashmore Beavers.

19:17.040 --> 19:18.570
We finished eight and four this year.

19:19.730 --> 19:21.620
I am the Ashmore Beaver.

19:22.140 --> 19:22.790
Or was.

19:23.270 --> 19:24.230
Dressed up like this for games.

19:24.280 --> 19:25.550
Got the crowd going.

19:26.650 --> 19:27.520
Or used to, anyway.

19:29.140 --> 19:30.000
I climbed on top of the scoreboard

19:30.070 --> 19:31.570
during the homecoming game this year.

19:31.630 --> 19:32.670
Fell off and broke my neck.

19:33.590 --> 19:35.140
Oh, I'm...

19:36.540 --> 19:37.410
uh, I'm sorry.

19:40.610 --> 19:42.290
Did you die while you had the costume on?

19:43.370 --> 19:43.960
Yeah.

19:44.540 --> 19:45.990
Of course, never having been dead before,

19:46.080 --> 19:47.790
I didn't realize how things worked.

19:48.370 --> 19:50.760
Like, you know, I died in this costume,

19:52.240 --> 19:53.560
so now I'll be stuck in it forever.

19:54.460 --> 19:55.160
Okay.

19:56.940 --> 19:58.040
What are you doing here?

19:59.230 --> 20:01.270
I mean, did you know Jeb while you were alive or something?

20:02.400 --> 20:03.680
Just sort of crossed paths one day.

20:04.420 --> 20:05.610
Realized he could see me.

20:07.180 --> 20:09.350
He thought I was one of those, you know, magical creatures.

20:09.510 --> 20:10.520
So I hammed it up a little bit.

20:10.580 --> 20:12.930
Starting talking like that stupid dinosaur on TV.

20:13.010 --> 20:15.350
: Hey, Jeb, I'm your friend Mr. Teefers.

20:15.690 --> 20:16.330
: Like that.

20:17.090 --> 20:18.300
Turns out the kid could use my help,

20:18.350 --> 20:19.730
so I decided to hang around for a while--

20:19.790 --> 20:21.530
pretend to be his imaginary friend.

20:22.230 --> 20:23.760
I give him advice sometimes,

20:23.860 --> 20:25.270
try to keep him on the straight and narrow.

20:27.700 --> 20:28.960
Honestly, it works out for both of us.

20:29.020 --> 20:30.230
I get pretty lonely sometimes.

20:33.040 --> 20:34.980
Look, I'm sorry if I'm weirding you out.

20:35.480 --> 20:36.620
It's just you seem nice.

20:37.110 --> 20:38.460
So I wanted to warn you about Jeb.

20:39.570 --> 20:40.340
Uh...

20:40.940 --> 20:42.440
Kid's got more issues than a newsstand.

20:42.490 --> 20:43.490
Seriously, if I were you,

20:43.550 --> 20:45.150
I'd find myself a new babysitting gig

20:45.210 --> 20:47.070
before he Krazy-Glues my hands together.

20:47.660 --> 20:48.350
He did that, you know.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.270
Two sitters ago. Not pretty.

20:51.660 --> 20:53.550
I can't... I mean, I can't just leave now.

20:54.350 --> 20:56.550
I already promised his mom that I'd stay and help out all week.

20:56.610 --> 20:57.640
I'm supposed to drive him to school tomorrow

20:57.710 --> 20:58.830
and then pick him up.

20:58.890 --> 21:00.280
She can't find anyone to replace me now.

21:00.940 --> 21:02.050
Well, you do what you have to do,

21:02.670 --> 21:05.240
but, honestly, I don't see things working out.

21:08.450 --> 21:10.680
Jeb can be a real handful when he doesn't like someone.

21:11.530 --> 21:13.850
And that stuff about your homework, trust me,

21:14.470 --> 21:16.440
that's not even close to the worst he can do.

21:19.270 --> 21:19.840
So you think this trial's

21:19.840 --> 21:21.130
actually going to wrap up tomorrow?

21:21.740 --> 21:23.600
I don't know. Devalos seems to think so.

21:24.460 --> 21:25.480
He doesn't think that Mallory's lawyer

21:25.560 --> 21:27.550
will actually put her on the stand.

21:30.420 --> 21:32.600
I'm sorry. I can't do this.

21:33.680 --> 21:34.240
Do what?

21:34.740 --> 21:35.460
This.

21:37.090 --> 21:37.760
Oh.

21:39.180 --> 21:40.380
You want me to sleep in the living room?

21:40.930 --> 21:41.740
You would do that?

21:42.420 --> 21:44.030
I'm not happy about it, but sure.

21:46.020 --> 21:46.900
I'm your husband.

21:47.900 --> 21:48.950
I know this will pass.

21:49.940 --> 21:50.850
No, wait a second.

21:51.070 --> 21:53.570
No, don't. Just stay.

21:55.520 --> 21:56.210
But do me a favor.

21:56.280 --> 21:58.450
Will you check my e-mail before you shut that thing down?

21:59.540 --> 22:00.720
Devalos said that the computers

22:00.800 --> 22:01.970
at the office aren't working.

22:05.700 --> 22:09.000
You have one new e-mail from the city of Phoenix.

22:09.390 --> 22:11.010
"Your voting district has changed?"

22:11.280 --> 22:12.610
Come on. Didn't we already get this e-mail?

22:12.670 --> 22:13.480
Just delete it.

22:24.290 --> 22:24.890
What?

22:25.230 --> 22:28.180
Nothing. It's just the kids are all asleep.

22:28.450 --> 22:30.780
It might be a good time for a little adult swim.

22:31.740 --> 22:33.440
Are you serious? Come on.

22:33.530 --> 22:35.640
Isn't it bad enough that I'm in bed with someone

22:35.710 --> 22:37.080
who looks like a stranger?

22:37.470 --> 22:39.400
Do you think I'm really gonna compound that felony

22:39.460 --> 22:40.900
by actually sleeping with you?

22:41.300 --> 22:41.840
Are you sure?

22:41.950 --> 22:42.730
Might be kinda fun.

22:43.540 --> 22:44.850
We are still in the same room.

22:45.210 --> 22:46.770
Don't push your luck.

22:56.490 --> 22:58.200
I knew we agreed on 100,000,

22:58.280 --> 23:00.140
but you know, I'm the one taking all the risk here.

23:00.210 --> 23:02.890
And I gotta be honest with you, I'm starting to get cold feet.

23:03.960 --> 23:07.240
Look, what I'm doing for you, it's a pretty unique service.

23:07.390 --> 23:08.860
I figure it's worth $200,000.

23:09.880 --> 23:11.670
Excellent. I'm glad you agree.

23:13.560 --> 23:14.110
Excuse me.

23:14.470 --> 23:15.680
You're gonna have to wrap up your call now.

23:15.990 --> 23:17.840
The recess is over. You need to return to the jury box.

23:18.850 --> 23:20.630
Don't worry. You just bought yourself an acquittal.

23:32.780 --> 23:34.000
What do you mean, they all look the same?

23:34.220 --> 23:36.080
They all look like him. They all look

23:36.150 --> 23:37.350
like the man I've been seeing.

23:37.440 --> 23:38.540
Every single one of 'em.

23:39.560 --> 23:42.010
Look, I know how crazy this sounds. Do you?

23:42.840 --> 23:45.130
Look, in my dream, one of the jurors

23:45.210 --> 23:48.230
was negotiating a bribe: $200,000

23:48.310 --> 23:49.610
for an acquittal in this case.

23:50.980 --> 23:52.810
Allison, I don't know what to do with that.

23:53.570 --> 23:54.390
Talk to the judge.

23:54.800 --> 23:56.230
The case has been compromised.

23:56.310 --> 23:58.790
So you say, but I'm about to make my closing argument.

23:59.590 --> 24:01.270
Now if you could identify the juror you saw,

24:01.390 --> 24:02.420
maybe I could make a case

24:02.490 --> 24:03.900
for an investigation of that person,

24:03.980 --> 24:06.920
but barring that, I'm afraid my hands are tied.

24:13.550 --> 24:14.050
Hello.

24:14.140 --> 24:14.810
Hey, it's Lee.

24:15.070 --> 24:16.590
Thought you'd want to know we just arrested someone

24:16.660 --> 24:18.090
for the murder of Peter Musgrove.

24:18.570 --> 24:19.370
Was his name Charlie?

24:19.790 --> 24:21.790
Charlie Boller-- Peter Musgrove's brother-in-law.

24:22.160 --> 24:24.220
And get this: Charlie's got a history.

24:24.650 --> 24:26.800
He already assaulted this guy once last year.

24:26.950 --> 24:28.480
We got him dead to rights, and he knows it.

24:28.540 --> 24:29.700
He's copping a plea.

24:29.980 --> 24:31.850
So listen, given you're the one who put us onto him,

24:31.920 --> 24:32.800
I thought you might want to sit in

24:32.870 --> 24:33.940
while I take his statement.

24:40.270 --> 24:41.140
Allison, you still there?

24:42.830 --> 24:43.790
Yeah. Sorry.

24:44.320 --> 24:46.940
Um, hey, do me a favor.

24:47.040 --> 24:48.130
When I get there, can you make sure

24:48.190 --> 24:49.280
you're wearing your badge?

24:49.340 --> 24:52.530
I'm having... some trouble with faces today.

24:56.180 --> 24:59.180
Okay, last stop: preschool.

24:59.310 --> 25:01.260
Everybody out.

25:01.890 --> 25:03.670
Mom told me that after this week,

25:03.790 --> 25:05.850
you won't be babysitting me anymore.

25:06.380 --> 25:07.730
But I don't want you to go.

25:08.090 --> 25:08.970
I like you.

25:10.540 --> 25:11.260
Sure you do.

25:12.060 --> 25:13.750
Why else would you ruin my homework

25:13.810 --> 25:15.110
and tear up my textbook?

25:15.700 --> 25:16.720
Is that why you're quitting?

25:17.130 --> 25:19.730
Because Mr. Teefers told me to play a joke on you?

25:20.060 --> 25:21.170
What are you talking about?

25:21.280 --> 25:24.810
What do you mean Mr. Teefers told you to play a joke on me?

25:25.710 --> 25:27.650
He tells me to do a lot of stuff.

25:28.200 --> 25:29.340
I try to tell people

25:29.450 --> 25:31.870
when Mr. Teefers tells me to do things,

25:32.010 --> 25:35.950
but they never believe me, Mom especially.

25:36.210 --> 25:38.390
She just cries.

25:39.160 --> 25:40.240
I gotta go now.

25:51.480 --> 25:53.240
I told you to find yourself a new gig.

25:54.900 --> 25:56.830
I tried to be nice about it, but you wouldn't listen.

25:56.910 --> 25:59.590
So now? No more Mr. Nice Beaver.

26:01.090 --> 26:03.780
No more Mr. Nice Beaver?

26:07.760 --> 26:09.080
Jeb doesn't need you, okay?

26:09.710 --> 26:11.090
I'm his friend, not you.

26:11.940 --> 26:13.290
If you're his friend,

26:14.030 --> 26:16.400
then why do you keep getting him into so much trouble?

26:17.420 --> 26:20.060
A few weeks before I died, my girlfriend broke up with me.

26:20.880 --> 26:22.840
We'd been together since our freshman year in high school.

26:24.430 --> 26:26.290
When I asked her why, she said her therapist thought

26:26.370 --> 26:28.210
I'd become a domineering influence,

26:28.380 --> 26:29.570
that she needed to get away from me

26:29.640 --> 26:31.190
to find out who she really was.

26:32.060 --> 26:33.020
I don't understand.

26:34.470 --> 26:36.110
What does any of that have...?

26:41.420 --> 26:43.880
Jeb's mother is a therapist.

26:45.890 --> 26:47.510
Was she treating your girlfriend?

26:48.640 --> 26:52.030
Are you seriously using her five-year-old

26:52.130 --> 26:53.100
to get back at her?

26:53.640 --> 26:54.400
Hey, what can I say?

26:54.530 --> 26:57.240
Once a domineering influence, always a domineering influence.

26:59.070 --> 27:00.960
You happen to notice those bags under her eyes?

27:02.070 --> 27:02.810
All me, baby.

27:03.950 --> 27:05.560
She hardly even sleeps these days

27:05.630 --> 27:08.210
'cause she's so worried about what Jeb might get into.

27:12.540 --> 27:13.560
Someone's waving at you.

27:23.140 --> 27:23.840
Yeah, that's him.

27:24.040 --> 27:25.800
That's my brother-in-law, Peter Musgrove.

27:26.830 --> 27:28.330
And yeah, I'm the one who killed him.

27:28.540 --> 27:29.310
I'm not denying it.

27:30.020 --> 27:31.760
A bullet in the brain. Any particular reason

27:31.830 --> 27:33.220
or are you just finishing what you started a year ago

27:33.220 --> 27:34.200
when you assaulted him?

27:34.210 --> 27:36.790
I didn't assault him. I beat the crap out of him.

27:37.060 --> 27:38.390
He stole some checks from me.

27:38.810 --> 27:40.830
Went out and bought himself a lot of expensive things.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.040
I told him I'd kill him if he ever did it again.

27:43.580 --> 27:45.500
Couple days ago, I get a call from the phone company.

27:45.770 --> 27:47.000
They say my last check bounced.

27:47.160 --> 27:48.330
I tell them that's impossible.

27:48.690 --> 27:49.500
They don't want to listen.

27:49.690 --> 27:51.010
So I get on the phone with my bank.

27:51.330 --> 27:53.200
They say there's a reason the last check didn't clear.

27:53.310 --> 27:55.140
They say I logged onto my account that morning,

27:55.140 --> 27:57.680
transferred every penny I had to some account offshore.

27:57.800 --> 27:59.810
Thing is, I hadn't been on my online account in weeks.

28:00.040 --> 28:00.610
Are you saying your

28:00.690 --> 28:02.560
brother-in-law cleaned you out? He was always messing

28:02.610 --> 28:04.630
with my computer every time he and my sister came over.

28:05.170 --> 28:06.200
He hacked me or something.

28:06.810 --> 28:08.790
So I loaded up my rifle, went to pay him a visit.

28:09.030 --> 28:10.200
He swore it wasn't him,

28:10.350 --> 28:12.020
that the same exact thing had happened to him;

28:12.280 --> 28:13.920
his bank account had been cleared out, too.

28:14.310 --> 28:16.780
I didn't believe him, so I shot the dumb son of a bitch.

28:17.970 --> 28:18.910
Joke was on me, though

28:19.160 --> 28:20.280
'cause I found out the very next day

28:20.490 --> 28:22.190
everything Peter was telling me was the truth.

28:23.020 --> 28:25.190
What? My sister called,

28:25.300 --> 28:26.210
asked me if I'd seen him.

28:27.220 --> 28:28.030
She was a wreck.

28:28.720 --> 28:30.260
She thought he'd run off on her because-- get this--

28:30.350 --> 28:31.940
their bank accounts had been wiped out

28:32.010 --> 28:32.940
Just like Peter said.

28:33.330 --> 28:34.120
But couldn't he have

28:34.190 --> 28:35.110
cleaned out those accounts?

28:35.200 --> 28:36.940
Maybe he really was planning on leaving your sister.

28:37.110 --> 28:38.200
He knew I'd kill him if he left.

28:38.450 --> 28:40.200
Besides, later that day, I had a friend of mine

28:40.290 --> 28:41.250
take a look at my computer,

28:41.360 --> 28:43.130
see if he could figure out what had happened with my money.

28:43.470 --> 28:45.730
He said it was all because of an e-mail I got from the city.

28:46.220 --> 28:47.980
Something about my voting district changing.

28:48.630 --> 28:49.880
Turns out the e-mail was a fake.

28:50.200 --> 28:51.800
When I opened it, I downloaded something

28:51.900 --> 28:53.780
called spyware onto my hard drive.

28:54.110 --> 28:54.880
And just like that,

28:55.200 --> 28:57.610
the guy who sent it had access to all of my information:

28:57.770 --> 28:58.900
my credit card statements,

28:59.010 --> 29:00.320
my PIN numbers, my social.

29:00.760 --> 29:02.890
It was easy for him to make the bank think he was me.

29:03.600 --> 29:04.840
He had all the numbers. He was me.

29:05.730 --> 29:06.790
He was you.

29:08.250 --> 29:09.080
That e-mail you opened--

29:09.190 --> 29:10.240
you said it was about voting districts?

29:11.210 --> 29:11.950
I opened one of those.

29:14.170 --> 29:15.160
Of course you did.

29:20.830 --> 29:21.600
Keep an eye on this guy.

29:26.500 --> 29:28.550
Hey. Where you going?

29:29.120 --> 29:30.050
What do you mean, "Of course you did"?

29:30.710 --> 29:32.500
The last few days, I've been seeing this face

29:32.600 --> 29:36.080
almost everywhere I go. I see it when I look at Joe.

29:36.600 --> 29:37.850
I saw it on those men in there.

29:38.010 --> 29:39.180
I see it when I look at you.

29:39.860 --> 29:42.210
And now I think I'm finally starting to understand why.

29:43.600 --> 29:44.680
I think it's the face of the man

29:44.780 --> 29:46.220
who's been sending out those e-mails

29:46.320 --> 29:48.170
telling everyone that their voting district has changed.

29:48.820 --> 29:50.300
He's an identity thief.

29:50.840 --> 29:54.530
That's why when I look at you or I look at Joe, I see him.

29:55.110 --> 29:56.740
Because he's taken your identities.

29:57.120 --> 29:59.820
Considering how often I've been seeing him lately,

30:00.060 --> 30:01.260
he must have done it to hundreds,

30:01.360 --> 30:02.420
maybe even thousands of people.

30:03.120 --> 30:03.850
I look like who now?

30:05.130 --> 30:06.170
Look, Lee, just trust me.

30:06.640 --> 30:07.270
Do what I'm doing.

30:07.350 --> 30:09.460
Go to your bank. Talk to somebody.

30:10.340 --> 30:12.460
Maybe we could stop him from taking anything else.

30:12.630 --> 30:14.140
Hi, you've reached Joe Dubois.

30:14.350 --> 30:16.010
Please leave your name and number and I'll call you back.

30:17.170 --> 30:18.810
Hey, honey, it's me again.

30:19.450 --> 30:20.850
Look, I just want to let you know

30:20.930 --> 30:22.920
I just put our credit cards on hold.

30:23.220 --> 30:25.670
Sorry to leave so many messages.

30:25.760 --> 30:27.010
Just... I'm at the bank.

30:27.150 --> 30:28.230
Call me when you get this, okay?

30:32.870 --> 30:36.490
Hey! Hey, stranger.

30:36.760 --> 30:38.330
Uh! Long time no see.

30:39.160 --> 30:39.740
It's you.

30:40.360 --> 30:41.420
It's the real you.

30:42.270 --> 30:43.390
I can finally see you.

30:44.190 --> 30:46.400
I guess this craziness is finally over.

30:48.280 --> 30:49.000
Did you get my message?

30:49.010 --> 30:49.740
Is that why you're here?

30:49.930 --> 30:50.860
Sorry. Do I know you?

30:52.850 --> 30:54.750
Thanks again for your patience, Mr. Dubois.

30:54.850 --> 30:55.610
If I could just get your signature,

30:55.620 --> 30:58.240
we can complete the wire transfer

30:58.320 --> 30:59.260
for your new account.

30:59.470 --> 31:01.120
Wire transfer? What are you talking about?

31:01.620 --> 31:03.410
Honey, why are you transferring our mon...?

31:06.980 --> 31:07.750
It was easy for him

31:07.820 --> 31:09.250
to make the bank think he was me.

31:09.570 --> 31:11.040
He had the numbers. He was me.

31:11.570 --> 31:13.030
You're him, aren't you?!

31:14.090 --> 31:16.710
You're the man who's been sending out all those e-mails!

31:17.660 --> 31:20.790
When I've been looking at Joe, I see you.

31:20.880 --> 31:23.200
And now that you're here, pretending to be Joe, I see him.

31:24.600 --> 31:26.090
You're the identity thief.

31:27.280 --> 31:29.050
Sir, this man's not my husband.

31:37.270 --> 31:39.060
Hey! Stop him!

31:40.830 --> 31:42.980
So this is the man whose face you've been seeing everywhere?

31:43.050 --> 31:44.760
The actual man? ALLISON: That's right.

31:45.030 --> 31:46.260
Well, how can you be so sure of that?

31:46.510 --> 31:48.720
If everyone looks like this man to you, it's...

31:48.840 --> 31:49.600
Well, that's over now.

31:49.790 --> 31:51.110
The only time I see his face now is

31:51.210 --> 31:52.820
when I see him, the real him.

31:53.010 --> 31:54.190
We checked the guy out.

31:54.260 --> 31:55.330
Turns out his name's Fred Rovick,

31:55.410 --> 31:57.760
and he does have a record-- not long, but colorful.

31:58.140 --> 31:59.840
Way back in the '80s, he got arrested for hacking

31:59.920 --> 32:03.540
his way behind an IRS firewall and erasing his dad's tax bill.

32:03.950 --> 32:05.540
This is when he was a sophomore in high school.

32:06.860 --> 32:09.220
Turns out a felony conviction makes it difficult

32:09.220 --> 32:11.780
????ff

32:11.780 --> 32:13.850
to land a gig with the big software firms,

32:14.060 --> 32:15.310
so Fred's had a tough go of it.

32:16.650 --> 32:18.630
Spent the last couple years fixing computers

32:18.640 --> 32:19.720
with the Brain Brigade.

32:19.850 --> 32:21.020
You know, those guys who come over to your place

32:21.110 --> 32:22.950
and fix your computer for 25 bucks an hour?

32:23.300 --> 32:24.200
Yeah, I've heard of them.

32:24.280 --> 32:26.630
My wife used them to help set up our wireless network at home.

32:26.930 --> 32:29.020
Well, turns out Fred meets a lot of wives

32:29.110 --> 32:30.370
while he's out doing his job.

32:30.980 --> 32:34.220
His, uh, manager told us over the past six months or so

32:34.300 --> 32:36.600
that Fred's been going on a bunch of maintenance calls

32:36.740 --> 32:38.180
for one client, in particular:

32:38.240 --> 32:41.210
a woman by the name of, uh, Mallory Kessinger.

32:43.140 --> 32:43.950
Mallory Kessinger?

32:45.470 --> 32:46.800
The woman I'm prosecuting?

32:47.010 --> 32:48.150
He wasn't just working for her.

32:48.930 --> 32:50.830
According to his manager at the Brain Brigade,

32:51.080 --> 32:53.560
he's been bragging about the big game he bagged

32:53.660 --> 32:54.450
up at the Kessinger estate.

32:55.310 --> 32:56.120
They're lovers.

32:56.690 --> 32:59.320
I think he may be the-the person who's attempting

32:59.400 --> 33:02.480
to pay off that juror to make sure that Mallory's acquitted.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.430
Okay. Wait a second.

33:04.510 --> 33:07.160
Didn't you tell me that the juror was asking for $200,000?

33:07.420 --> 33:09.070
Where does someone who works for the Brain Brigade

33:09.160 --> 33:10.170
get a hold of that kind of money?

33:10.390 --> 33:11.270
Oh, from us.

33:12.820 --> 33:14.960
Every single computer that the city owns

33:15.040 --> 33:16.860
has been acting weird the last few days.

33:17.130 --> 33:18.650
We checked with the IT department.

33:19.050 --> 33:20.620
They've been investigating the possibility

33:20.690 --> 33:22.710
that it's not just some weird glitch.

33:23.290 --> 33:24.450
They think they've been hacked,

33:24.840 --> 33:26.730
that someone broke into the city mainframe

33:26.900 --> 33:29.040
and used it to send out thousands of e-mails

33:29.150 --> 33:31.300
telling everyone that their voting district had changed.

33:31.740 --> 33:34.560
Oh, yeah. I got one of those.

33:34.640 --> 33:36.660
I've just been too busy with this trial to open it.

33:37.030 --> 33:37.710
Delete it.

33:37.940 --> 33:39.250
Those e-mails are full of spyware.

33:39.980 --> 33:41.470
Anyone who downloaded the attachment

33:41.570 --> 33:42.700
with the map of the new districts

33:42.790 --> 33:44.810
got, uh, software on their hard drive

33:44.900 --> 33:47.190
that gave the hacker access to everything on their computer:

33:47.280 --> 33:49.350
personal information, passwords, you name it.

33:50.210 --> 33:51.560
You got to admit, it's a pretty good plan.

33:52.300 --> 33:53.800
Official-looking e-mail from the city?

33:53.890 --> 33:55.480
No one's gonna think twice about opening it.

33:56.240 --> 33:56.940
I didn't.

33:57.300 --> 33:58.850
I think that's why I've been seeing this guy everywhere.

33:59.360 --> 34:00.750
Everyone who opened this e-mail,

34:01.120 --> 34:03.790
everyone whose, uh, identity was stolen,

34:03.960 --> 34:05.320
they all looked like Fred Rovick.

34:06.410 --> 34:06.910
Look, sir,

34:07.110 --> 34:08.710
the jury's still deliberating.

34:09.469 --> 34:10.360
We need to tell the judge

34:10.449 --> 34:12.120
that one of the jurors has been tampered with.

34:12.219 --> 34:14.830
Maybe we can get her to-to declare a mistrial.

34:16.360 --> 34:17.650
Based on what, exactly?

34:19.260 --> 34:21.330
Look, I'm inclined to believe you both,

34:21.420 --> 34:22.639
but even so, there's no proof,

34:22.730 --> 34:24.170
nothing I can present to the judge.

34:24.500 --> 34:27.199
I can't even tell her which juror is compromised.

34:31.159 --> 34:31.840
Well...

34:32.389 --> 34:34.420
I guess it's a moot point. I'm needed back in court.

34:34.860 --> 34:37.409
The jury in the Kessinger case just came back.

34:38.920 --> 34:40.170
What the hell did you say to Jeb?

34:42.330 --> 34:43.600
Mr. Teefers.

34:44.030 --> 34:45.219
Good. You're here.

34:45.980 --> 34:46.710
Yeah, I'm here.

34:47.219 --> 34:48.280
I'm here every night at 9:00.

34:48.380 --> 34:49.540
That's when Jeb and I usually talk.

34:49.650 --> 34:51.040
But tonight, he just ignored me.

34:51.860 --> 34:53.389
He kept mumbling, "Go away."

34:54.620 --> 34:55.340
What gives?

34:56.570 --> 34:58.650
Yeah. Sorry.

34:58.760 --> 34:59.660
But I don't think Jeb's going

34:59.720 --> 35:01.400
to be paying much attention to you anymore.

35:02.100 --> 35:02.600
Really?

35:03.340 --> 35:04.070
I doubt that.

35:04.870 --> 35:06.170
See, you might have said something to him

35:06.250 --> 35:07.230
that will work in the short term,

35:07.330 --> 35:09.000
but think about it. You can't outlast me.

35:09.740 --> 35:10.970
I'm in this for eternity.

35:11.440 --> 35:14.350
I can visit Jeb whenever and wherever I want.

35:14.710 --> 35:15.560
And eventually...

35:16.690 --> 35:17.750
he'll start listening again.

35:18.760 --> 35:20.150
See, you're missing the point.

35:22.000 --> 35:22.590
Come with me.

35:23.670 --> 35:24.850
There's something I want to show you.

35:32.770 --> 35:33.320
What is that?

35:35.820 --> 35:36.810
What the hell is that?

35:37.190 --> 35:39.380
You can rent one at a costume shop.

35:40.310 --> 35:41.880
Cost all the money I earned this week,

35:41.960 --> 35:45.690
but it was worth it, to get you out of Jeb's life.

35:46.050 --> 35:47.130
Get me out of Jeb's life?

35:48.470 --> 35:49.890
I don't know what you're talking about,

35:50.430 --> 35:52.520
but I think I just figured out who I'm gonna mess with

35:52.590 --> 35:53.890
after I get tired of Jeb's mom.

35:54.830 --> 35:56.100
Hope you're ready to get it on, kid,

35:56.160 --> 35:56.900
'cause you just made my list

35:56.960 --> 35:57.790
of things to do.

35:58.230 --> 35:59.590
After I put Jeb to bed,

36:00.510 --> 36:02.090
: Mr. Teefers paid him a visit.

36:03.890 --> 36:05.060
That stupid voice you do?

36:05.490 --> 36:06.750
It was easy to imitate.

36:07.670 --> 36:09.450
I told Jeb that I was going away.

36:09.920 --> 36:11.930
That he wouldn't be seeing Mr. Teefers anymore.

36:13.680 --> 36:16.070
He was sad, but I explained

36:16.160 --> 36:17.540
that he was ready to be on his own.

36:18.960 --> 36:21.200
And that there was one thing that he had to look out for.

36:23.380 --> 36:24.980
Mr. Teefers' evil twin.

36:26.680 --> 36:27.650
And I warned him

36:27.880 --> 36:28.950
that he would be showing up

36:29.030 --> 36:30.490
and trying to get him to do stuff,

36:30.550 --> 36:31.860
but that Jeb should ignore him.

36:32.590 --> 36:33.690
Until he goes away.

36:34.830 --> 36:37.640
And he will go away.

36:38.300 --> 36:40.140
You seriously think the kid's gonna buy that?

36:41.480 --> 36:42.650
I'm gonna walk in there right now

36:42.740 --> 36:44.620
and tell him I'm the real Mr. Teefers.

36:45.080 --> 36:46.540
That one he saw earlier tonight?

36:47.220 --> 36:48.420
That's the evil twin.

36:49.290 --> 36:50.690
You could give it a shot.

36:52.140 --> 36:53.640
But I wouldn't get my hopes up.

36:54.900 --> 36:56.910
See, after our conversation,

36:58.440 --> 37:00.520
I told him that we had to seal our pact.

37:01.710 --> 37:03.190
And I had Jeb tie

37:03.780 --> 37:07.260
a red ribbon around Mr. Teefers' wrist,

37:07.800 --> 37:09.340
so that he'd be able to tell

37:09.910 --> 37:12.400
whether he was talking to the real Mr. Teefers.

37:13.230 --> 37:13.760
Come on.

37:15.080 --> 37:16.310
Sucks, huh?

37:17.040 --> 37:19.830
That the one thing that you can't change

37:19.910 --> 37:20.970
is the way that you look.

37:23.350 --> 37:24.740
So I guess you'll be moving along now.

37:27.260 --> 37:27.980
You played me.

37:29.160 --> 37:31.710
I can't believe you played me. What are you, like, 16?

37:31.760 --> 37:33.780
You're already worse than that bitch therapist.

37:34.770 --> 37:35.270
Leave.

37:36.160 --> 37:37.320
Do something else.

37:38.140 --> 37:39.860
Or go to wherever it is you're supposed to be heading

37:39.940 --> 37:42.510
because there's nothing for you here.

37:43.070 --> 37:44.230
Okay? Not anymore.

37:46.990 --> 37:50.080
Now. I have Spanish homework.

37:57.130 --> 37:59.950
Am I surprised that the jury declared itself

38:00.030 --> 38:01.270
to be hopelessly deadlocked?

38:01.680 --> 38:02.330
Yes and no.

38:02.580 --> 38:04.210
Frankly, I was expecting the speedy acquittal

38:04.420 --> 38:05.870
that my client deserves.

38:06.590 --> 38:07.500
But at the end of the day,

38:08.000 --> 38:09.440
a mistrial works in our favor, too.

38:10.280 --> 38:13.390
Mallory Kessinger is walking home a free woman,

38:13.810 --> 38:15.770
and that's clearly the most important thing.

38:16.070 --> 38:18.390
Do you expect the district attorney

38:18.490 --> 38:20.380
to refile charges against your client?

38:21.000 --> 38:23.510
That would be a very foolhardy move indeed.

38:23.660 --> 38:25.580
Mr. Devalos has had his day in court.

38:26.420 --> 38:28.370
I think it's time for everyone to move on.

38:29.860 --> 38:31.330
REPORTER 2: Mallory, do you have any comments?

38:31.960 --> 38:32.740
Um...

38:35.140 --> 38:36.520
I loved my husband.

38:37.680 --> 38:38.950
I loved Donald,

38:39.350 --> 38:41.550
and I miss him so, so badly.

38:42.480 --> 38:44.560
I just hope everyone realizes that now.

38:45.570 --> 38:48.340
200 grand to get access to a couple billion?

38:48.860 --> 38:51.090
That'll be the best money she ever spent.

38:51.590 --> 38:52.600
Well, she didn't even spend her own money.

38:52.880 --> 38:54.040
She and her boyfriend stole it.

38:54.290 --> 38:54.810
True.

38:56.070 --> 38:57.420
But there is a bright side.

38:58.170 --> 39:00.330
They didn't steal anything from us.

39:01.510 --> 39:03.560
Thank goodness you showed up at the bank

39:03.660 --> 39:05.130
before the transfer went through.

39:05.670 --> 39:06.360
Hmm.

39:12.700 --> 39:13.400
Coming to bed?

39:15.450 --> 39:18.610
Well, you certainly are in an awfully good mood.

39:18.780 --> 39:19.850
Well, the girls are asleep.

39:20.110 --> 39:22.520
When you look at me, you no longer see Fred Rovick,

39:22.600 --> 39:24.400
international man of mystery.

39:24.910 --> 39:27.730
And I'm holding a certain rain check.

39:28.430 --> 39:29.020
Hmm.

39:29.880 --> 39:30.430
Come on.

39:31.480 --> 39:33.160
I'm dying to cash this thing in.

39:51.750 --> 39:52.940
Hmm. Hello?

39:53.100 --> 39:53.860
FRED : Hey, Mallory.

39:53.950 --> 39:55.530
How's the first day of the rest of your life going?

39:55.930 --> 39:56.530
Freddy!

39:57.590 --> 39:59.080
Going just fine.

40:00.020 --> 40:01.650
Well, there is the occasional moment

40:01.720 --> 40:03.750
where I do miss the late J. Donald.

40:04.400 --> 40:05.630
But then I just go on the computer

40:05.710 --> 40:06.750
and buy myself something.

40:07.260 --> 40:08.550
And that helps me feel better.

40:09.340 --> 40:10.260
Now, listen, Freddy.

40:10.520 --> 40:12.220
I've been seeing your face all over the news

40:12.270 --> 40:13.220
the past couple days.

40:13.480 --> 40:15.090
I'm so sorry that the police figured out

40:15.150 --> 40:16.650
you stole all those identities.

40:17.120 --> 40:17.940
Yeah. Me, too.

40:18.410 --> 40:20.070
Don't think I'll be back in Phoenix for a while,

40:20.550 --> 40:21.540
or even the U.S.

40:22.170 --> 40:25.380
Aww. I'm gonna miss you so, so much.

40:25.730 --> 40:27.530
I'm so glad to get to hear your voice.

40:28.410 --> 40:28.950
Mmm.

40:29.530 --> 40:32.170
But, Freddy, listen, if you ever need anything...

40:32.420 --> 40:34.880
maybe a loan to keep you afloat wherever you are ...

40:35.040 --> 40:36.570
I'm only a phone call away.

40:36.770 --> 40:39.120
Actually, Mallory, I'm pretty well set for money.

40:39.450 --> 40:40.810
I've been working something else

40:40.920 --> 40:41.870
since I went underground.

40:43.630 --> 40:45.090
Well, I'm glad you're doing all right, Freddy.

40:45.220 --> 40:47.120
But I'm gonna have to get off now, okay?

40:47.520 --> 40:49.140
It's my late husband's business manager,

40:49.260 --> 40:50.570
and I've been waiting for him to confirm

40:50.650 --> 40:52.510
that the last of the assets are in my name now.

40:53.040 --> 40:54.320
Sure. You go.

40:54.700 --> 40:55.890
But the business guy's not calling

40:55.920 --> 40:57.210
to tell you you're swimming in money.

40:57.520 --> 40:59.130
He's calling to tell you you're dead broke.

40:59.620 --> 41:00.670
That's not funny.

41:01.740 --> 41:02.560
It's true, Mallory.

41:03.330 --> 41:04.720
Every single penny is gone.

41:05.510 --> 41:06.550
I cleaned you out.

41:07.980 --> 41:09.090
See, I didn't like having to steal

41:09.180 --> 41:10.280
from all those innocent people,

41:10.340 --> 41:11.310
but I knew there was no other way

41:11.370 --> 41:12.830
to get that juror in our pocket.

41:13.330 --> 41:14.330
I needed you to get off

41:14.400 --> 41:16.150
so you'd have access to your husband's money.

41:16.300 --> 41:17.800
Then I'd have access to it, too.

41:18.340 --> 41:19.920
You-You messed with my computer, too?

41:20.180 --> 41:21.650
What did you think was gonna happen, Mallory?

41:21.760 --> 41:23.090
You and me'd live happily ever after?

41:23.550 --> 41:26.590
Couple billion dollars goes a long way where I am.

41:26.740 --> 41:27.830
I'm feeling so flush

41:27.900 --> 41:29.620
that I even returned the 200K I stole

41:29.690 --> 41:32.790
from those poor working stiffs, plus 7% interest.

41:33.220 --> 41:34.030
It only seemed right.

41:34.750 --> 41:36.620
What about me? How the hell am I supposed to live?

41:36.870 --> 41:37.940
You'll figure something out.

41:38.240 --> 41:40.610
After all, you've still got your looks.

41:48.790 --> 41:49.420
You okay?

41:50.480 --> 41:51.100
Yeah.

41:52.070 --> 41:52.570
Honey,

41:53.760 --> 41:57.990
what is seven percent of $25,000?

41:59.100 --> 42:02.720
It's a little over $1,700. Why?

42:03.240 --> 42:05.670
Oh, nothing.

42:06.040 --> 42:07.460
I'm just starting to wish

42:08.120 --> 42:09.950
that Fred Rovick had been able

42:09.960 --> 42:11.430
to get that money out of our account.

42:14.530 --> 42:16.760
We could have come out ahead on the deal.
