Right?

15:45.278 --> 15:47.989
Okay. Then why was her last contact
with anyone

15:48.072 --> 15:50.324
a 23-minute phone call to 911?

16:23.983 --> 16:26.068
The report says the unit arrived at 5:40.

16:26.152 --> 16:28.988
Officers interviewed several residents
who said they...

16:29.071 --> 16:31.949
saw your daughter leave on her own
with no sign of, um...

16:33.034 --> 16:34.452
suspicious activity.

16:37.288 --> 16:38.706
This is her jacket.

16:38.789 --> 16:40.917
[detective] Yeah, well,
as far as the 911 call goes,

16:41.000 --> 16:42.919

16:46.130 --> 16:48.633
[detective] You got a close relationship
with her, Ms. Gilbert?

16:49.342 --> 16:50.259
Excuse me?

16:50.843 --> 16:53.346
[detective] What was she doing
in a gated community,

16:54.347 --> 16:56.933
100 miles away from home
in the middle of the night?

16:57.016 --> 16:58.434
[Sarra continues tapping]

16:58.518 --> 17:01.103
Can I be frank here with you
just for a minute, please?

17:02.522 --> 17:05.149
When girls like this go missing,

17:05.650 --> 17:07.109
it's a high-risk environment.

17:07.985 --> 17:11.197
You know, I mean, maybe she ran away,
maybe she'll turn up.

17:11.280 --> 17:14.742
Hey. Do you think you could stop that
for one second, please, sweetheart?

17:14.825 --> 17:16.035
Just one.

17:16.118 --> 17:17.620
My daughter isn't on drugs.

17:18.412 --> 17:20.581
She didn't run away. She's missing.

17:21.874 --> 17:25.086
Now, I have been hung up on,
dismissed, and ignored,

17:25.169 --> 17:27.505

17:27.588 --> 17:28.673

17:28.756 --> 17:30.716
Now, you say she's not missing. Fine.

17:30.800 --> 17:33.052
That's your position, but here's mine.

17:33.135 --> 17:35.471
She called for help at 4:51,

17:35.555 --> 17:37.139
and you arrived at 5:40.

17:37.223 --> 17:41.185

This is an anomaly. There's...

she's a ghost.

Residents seemed pretty calm about it.
Everything seemed to be kosher.

21:03.053 --> 21:06.515
They figured that it was
a domestic disturbance

21:06.599 --> 21:07.767

-What kind of parties?

-No. I don't.

You're searching everywhere, right?

22:26.303 --> 22:27.680
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

22:29.932 --> 22:33.561
I wanted to ask you some questions
about Shannan, if that's okay.

22:33.644 --> 22:37.648
Is there anything that you can tell me
about the men in Shannan's life?

22:38.107 --> 22:40.609
She has a boyfriend, Alex Diaz.

22:41.193 --> 22:43.153
Anybody else we should be looking at?

22:43.237 --> 22:45.155
A driver. Pak. Michael Pak.

22:45.656 --> 22:46.782
What about the doctor?

22:47.867 --> 22:49.410
[Dormer] What doctor?

22:49.493 --> 22:52.079
He called me
the morning after she went missing.

22:52.538 --> 22:54.415
He said he saw her and he helped her.

22:54.498 --> 22:56.292
He runs a home for wayward girls.

22:57.001 --> 22:58.002
What about her jacket?

22:58.085 --> 23:00.254
We have the jacket and it's being tested.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.843
Can you recall this doctor's name?

23:07.303 --> 23:09.138
[quietly] Fuck. Oh.

23:09.805 --> 23:11.682
Harper? Haskell?

23:11.765 --> 23:14.435
-It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
-I don't remember.

23:15.769 --> 23:19.189
[Dormer] Mrs. Gilbert, there's a lot
we don't know at the moment.

23:20.316 --> 23:22.818
Which is why it's really important

23:23.736 --> 23:25.404
that you don't talk to the media.

23:25.988 --> 23:27.031
Let us handle that.

23:28.032 --> 23:30.492
One wrong word,
and they'll make a meal out of it.

It's in your best interest.

23:33.120 --> 23:34.038

Well, what do you expect them

24:15.537 --> 24:16.789
You've never said that.

It sounds like you're blaming her.

24:21.335 --> 24:22.670
Maybe I should blame you

24:22.753 --> 24:25.255
for not telling me
she's in an abusive relationship.

she was a prostitute?

25:01.208 --> 25:02.751
[softly] Fucking kidding me?

25:02.835 --> 25:05.379
So, I went inside and...

25:05.879 --> 25:09.341
Shannan was behind the couch
on her hands and knees, shaking.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.720
-And she called 911.
-[Shannan over recording] <i>Help me!</i>

-[Pak] Shannan!

25:19.184 --> 25:21.854
So then I said, "I'm trying to help you."

26:58.575 --> 27:01.745
[news reporter]<i> Oak Beach resident,</i>
<i>Joseph Brewer, who hired Shannan Gilbert,</i>

27:01.829 --> 27:05.541
<i>has been cleared by Suffolk County Police</i>
<i>after taking a polygraph,</i>

27:05.624 --> 27:08.293
<i>leaving two questions still unanswered:</i>

27:08.377 --> 27:10.587
<i>who is killing sex workers on Long Island,</i>

27:10.671 --> 27:12.256
<i>and where is Shannan Gilbert?</i>

27:12.339 --> 27:14.007
[male reporter]
<i>Police have identified the remains</i>

27:14.091 --> 27:15.801
<i>-of the four women...</i>
-Yes, hello.

27:15.884 --> 27:18.345
It's the 20th goddamned time I've called!

27:19.096 --> 27:22.724
What are they doing to find her,
and why did they let that fuck go?

27:22.808 --> 27:23.642
He hire...

27:23.725 --> 27:25.519
[female reporter]
<i>...a prostitute who went missing</i>

27:25.602 --> 27:27.771
<i>after apparently meeting a client</i>
<i>on Craigslist. </i>

27:27.855 --> 27:31.984
<i>Are dozens more murdered women</i>
<i>dumped like trash</i>

27:32.609 --> 27:34.736
<i>on the same strip of beach,</i>

27:34.820 --> 27:36.697
<i>waiting to be uncovered?</i>

27:36.822 --> 27:40.409
<i>We are live</i>
<i>at the beach-turned-burial-ground.</i>

27:40.492 --> 27:44.163
[man on TV] <i>The girls are very available.</i>
<i>They're very vulnerable.</i>

27:44.705 --> 27:47.666
<i>They have no family, and there's nobody</i>
<i>out there looking for them.</i>

28:11.106 --> 28:11.940
[exhales sharply]

28:29.833 --> 28:31.084
What's going on, Mrs. Gilbert?

28:31.168 --> 28:33.545
Either your phone's broke
or your secretary's a moron

28:33.629 --> 28:35.881
because I must have left 50 messages
for you.

28:36.924 --> 28:40.302
This is my daughter,
Shannan Maria Gilbert.

28:40.385 --> 28:43.263
There's one here
for every day that she's missing.

28:43.347 --> 28:44.973
and I'm gonna continue posting these

28:45.057 --> 28:47.309
until you either find her
or die of paper cuts.

28:47.893 --> 28:51.939
-Do not ignore me.
-Nobody is ignoring you, Mrs. Gilbert.

28:52.814 --> 28:55.567
I have a talent for holding grudges
and unless you help me,

28:55.651 --> 28:57.986
I'm gonna raise more hell
than you can handle.

28:58.570 --> 29:02.574
And don't you ever fucking call
my daughter a prostitute again!

29:05.994 --> 29:08.789
[man laughing]

29:08.872 --> 29:09.706
[door bangs shut]

29:09.790 --> 29:11.625
[keyboard clacking]

29:11.708 --> 29:15.045
Okay, tell them we'll do the vigil,
but we want to meet them first.

29:15.128 --> 29:18.090
-And make sure everybody comes.
-What are you wearing?

29:23.011 --> 29:25.764
[keyboard clacking]

29:37.317 --> 29:40.487
[beeping]

29:40.570 --> 29:42.948
It's a long way to Oak Beach.

29:44.116 --> 29:46.827
-What were you guys talking about?
-[Pak] I don't know. I...

29:48.787 --> 29:49.788
work.

29:51.248 --> 29:52.249
The weather...

29:55.002 --> 29:56.753
Her and her boyfriend sneaking Taco Bell

29:56.837 --> 29:59.256
in the new Freddy movie
over at the Hudson Mall.

30:01.383 --> 30:03.635
Did she say anything
about going to visit her mom?

30:04.303 --> 30:06.054
[beeping continues]

30:06.722 --> 30:08.307
[laughs]

30:08.765 --> 30:10.809
Wait. Are you serious?

30:11.476 --> 30:14.938
[beeping continues]

30:15.022 --> 30:17.024
Do you know anything about her mom?

30:20.819 --> 30:23.739
Oh, my God. These women are so pathetic.

30:24.573 --> 30:25.991
The less we say, the better.

30:26.074 --> 30:28.535
We don't need them knowing
our personal business.

30:30.287 --> 30:31.288
What's that for?

30:31.371 --> 30:33.123
My notebook. I'm gonna take notes.

30:34.750 --> 30:35.584
[Mari sighs]

30:39.755 --> 30:41.256
Maybe we should go around?

30:42.382 --> 30:46.345
I'm Missy. I drove in from Connecticut
for my sister, Maureen.

30:47.304 --> 30:49.473
It's so good
to finally meet all of you in person.

30:50.682 --> 30:51.600
Mom.

30:53.935 --> 30:54.936
Say something.

30:59.191 --> 31:00.067
Uh, Lorraine.

31:01.568 --> 31:03.362
My daughter's Megan.

31:06.490 --> 31:08.700
I sold my TV to be here from Maine,

31:08.784 --> 31:11.495
so I have the cash to stay here
until the vigil.

31:12.829 --> 31:14.039
I'm Lynn.

31:15.582 --> 31:18.210
My daughter is Melissa.

31:19.169 --> 31:21.421
This is my other daughter, Amanda.

31:21.505 --> 31:23.048
We came here from Buffalo.

31:24.424 --> 31:25.258
[horn honks]

31:27.886 --> 31:29.262
[Lorraine] Oh. Kim is here.

31:32.808 --> 31:35.060
-[door opens]
-[Kim] Sorry, I'm late, y'all.

31:36.019 --> 31:38.230
[Missy] We were just going around
introducing ourselves.

31:38.313 --> 31:40.565
Where we're from, who we've lost.

31:40.649 --> 31:41.650
Okay. Kim...

31:42.484 --> 31:44.403
North Carolina. Um...

31:44.486 --> 31:46.530
I like Rocky Road ice cream

31:46.613 --> 31:48.573
and long walks on the beach,

31:48.657 --> 31:50.033
and my sister was Amber.

31:50.617 --> 31:51.451
[sniffs]

31:53.912 --> 31:54.913
Did I miss anything?

31:57.207 --> 32:00.377
[Pak over recording, laughing]
<i>Wait. Are you serious?</i>

32:01.002 --> 32:03.088
<i>Do you know anything about her mom?</i>

32:03.797 --> 32:05.715
<i>'Cause she's a real piece of work.</i>

32:06.716 --> 32:09.302
<i>Yeah, abandoned her own daughter</i>
<i>when she was just a kid.</i>

32:10.887 --> 32:13.557
<i>Shannan was in and out of foster homes</i>
<i>her whole life.</i>

32:14.516 --> 32:16.810
<i>All her mom is good for</i>
<i>is taking her money.</i>

32:18.645 --> 32:21.064
<i>Doesn't even care how Shannan made it.</i>

32:22.482 --> 32:24.734
<i>Just as long as she shared the wealth.</i>

32:26.278 --> 32:28.238
[Lorraine]
My daughter had three cellphones.

32:28.905 --> 32:30.740
[Lynn]
My daughter had three cellphones.

32:30.824 --> 32:34.703
She was working on the... Craigslist.

32:34.786 --> 32:36.538
[Missy] Yes, so did Maureen.

32:36.621 --> 32:38.081
[Lynn] So did Melissa.

32:38.165 --> 32:40.584
They all did.
That's why they're all so the same,

32:40.667 --> 32:42.711
because online,
you can practically go shopping.

32:42.794 --> 32:44.963
[Lorraine] Sooner or later,
they're gonna get this guy.

32:45.046 --> 32:46.298
There's gotta be some...

32:46.798 --> 32:48.508
computer trace they can do.

32:48.592 --> 32:50.552
[Kim]. Mm-mm. They don't get you on email.

32:50.635 --> 32:52.471
You post a number, then they call.

32:52.554 --> 32:56.224
Which is untraceable
because the girls work on burner phones.

32:56.308 --> 32:58.059
Look at you, knowing your shit.

32:58.727 --> 33:01.229
They think they're all drug addicts.

33:01.313 --> 33:04.232
-Melissa wasn't even into drugs.
-Neither was Maureen.

33:04.316 --> 33:05.192
She drank.

33:05.275 --> 33:08.153
[Kim] Drinking's better than drugs
because it's legal.

33:08.236 --> 33:10.780
But coke is the best way
to keep a call going.

33:11.490 --> 33:12.741
Make some real bank.

33:14.075 --> 33:17.037
Your girls knew that,
whether you want to believe it or not.

33:19.122 --> 33:20.457
[Lorraine sighs]

33:20.540 --> 33:23.210
They told me
Megan was where she wants to be.

33:24.044 --> 33:24.878
That, uh...

33:26.880 --> 33:28.173
That she didn't love me.

33:29.925 --> 33:31.092
[sighs, groans]

33:31.968 --> 33:34.679
As sad as it is,
I feel some kind of relief.

33:35.180 --> 33:37.265
At least they're finally paying attention.

33:37.349 --> 33:38.266
Are you shitting me?

33:39.726 --> 33:43.188
If you think they give one goddamn
about these girls, you're delusional.

33:44.189 --> 33:45.941
They weren't searching for them.

33:46.983 --> 33:50.612
A cop stopped along the side of the road
to let his dog take a shit.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.781
He accidentally found them.

33:52.864 --> 33:54.199
What I meant was...

33:55.492 --> 33:59.037
at least it's on the news
and people are aware of it.

33:59.996 --> 34:01.665
Have you watched the news?

34:02.457 --> 34:05.627
It's all, "He's a cop," "He's a clammer,"
he's this, he's that.

34:05.710 --> 34:07.379
It's all "him," "him," "him."

34:08.213 --> 34:10.549
What about our girls?
Who's talking about them?

34:11.383 --> 34:15.095
And when they do,
it's "prostitute," "hooker,"

34:15.512 --> 34:17.514
"sex worker," "escort."

34:18.056 --> 34:20.517
Never "friend," "sister,"

34:21.268 --> 34:22.477
"mother," "daughter."

34:23.812 --> 34:24.854
They don't care.

34:25.605 --> 34:26.731
They blame them.

34:28.358 --> 34:30.694
And it's our job, as mothers,

34:31.194 --> 34:32.487
and sisters,

34:33.363 --> 34:35.532
to make sure these girls
are not forgotten.

34:37.200 --> 34:38.827
So, should we wait on the vigil?

34:39.661 --> 34:42.455
No, we're doing the vigil.
We're going to Oak Beach,

34:43.039 --> 34:44.958
to their front fucking yard.

35:10.942 --> 35:12.360
Who tipped them off?

35:16.448 --> 35:20.285
This is a private community!
I'll call the police!

35:20.368 --> 35:22.662
Go ahead.
It'll take them an hour to get here.

35:25.915 --> 35:27.792
Speaking of which,
can I borrow your phone?

35:27.876 --> 35:29.628
Sure. Why?

35:29.711 --> 35:31.338
They already know my number.

35:35.967 --> 35:38.887
There's a crazy lady
about to tear through Oak Beach.

35:38.970 --> 35:40.889
[all giggle]

35:40.972 --> 35:42.265
Come quick.

36:08.500 --> 36:09.584
Who lives here?

36:10.543 --> 36:13.213
[sighs] The son of a bitch who hired her.

36:35.485 --> 36:36.861
[knocking on door]

37:12.522 --> 37:13.356
[exhales]

37:19.446 --> 37:21.030
[Shannan panting]

37:21.114 --> 37:22.031
[Sarra] Mom?

37:26.786 --> 37:27.620
Mom.

37:27.704 --> 37:28.621
[police siren blares]

37:43.303 --> 37:44.304
[Mari] Twelve minutes.

37:45.472 --> 37:49.517
Now we both you know you can show up
on time and your secretary's not a retard.

37:50.351 --> 37:53.146
Can we just go back to my office
and talk about this?

37:53.229 --> 37:54.439
[Mari] We'll talk right here.

37:56.316 --> 37:57.233
This is a...

37:57.317 --> 37:59.486
This is a private community.

37:59.569 --> 38:01.613
Well, then why don't you arrest me?

38:01.696 --> 38:03.698
Listen, I came here to do you a favor.

38:03.782 --> 38:05.909
I don't want to see you
hauled away in handcuffs.

38:05.992 --> 38:08.369
Don't you understand
that when the uniforms get here,

38:08.453 --> 38:12.081
-they're gonna cite you for trespassing.
-Okay, let me get this straight.

38:12.165 --> 38:15.168
My daughter calls for help
but it takes you an hour to get here,

38:15.251 --> 38:16.920
but the Stepford Wives call you

38:17.003 --> 38:19.547
and you show up in less time
than it takes to make a sandwich!

38:19.631 --> 38:23.635
Whatever it is that you're looking for,
Mrs. Gilbert, it is not here.

38:24.219 --> 38:27.096
Okay, then why did my 14-year-old
just find her sister's earring

38:27.180 --> 38:29.432
outside the home of the man
that you just set free?

38:30.475 --> 38:33.394
Shannan went screaming through here
at 4:51 in the morning,

38:33.478 --> 38:35.271
and no one helped her.

38:35.355 --> 38:37.482
Where is the outrage? Where's the concern?

38:38.316 --> 38:40.485
Four dead bodies show up
in my neighborhood,

38:40.568 --> 38:43.238
I'd be shouting from the rooftops
to get to the bottom of it.

38:44.239 --> 38:45.323
What are they hiding?

38:47.575 --> 38:49.452
What are you hiding, Mrs. Gilbert?

38:50.495 --> 38:53.331
You never told me
that Shannan grew up in foster care.

38:57.085 --> 38:59.379
You never told me
you nearly got shit-canned

38:59.462 --> 39:01.297
for mismanaging your department.

39:03.758 --> 39:05.176
Keep up the good work, Commissioner.

39:16.062 --> 39:17.313
[Dormer, quietly] Fuck's sake.

39:17.397 --> 39:20.191
[dog barking]

39:23.278 --> 39:26.114
I wrote down every house number
and license plate I saw.

39:26.197 --> 39:29.200
We need to talk to these people
and these people.

39:30.076 --> 39:31.244
They might've seen her.

39:31.327 --> 39:33.496
[Mari] No one's gonna talk
'cause they want us out.

39:34.455 --> 39:38.251
These guys are looking out for each other.
They all have friends in Suffolk PD.

39:38.334 --> 39:41.838
The police said
everybody passed lie detector tests.

39:41.921 --> 39:44.382
[Mari] Yeah, but anybody
can pass a lie detector test

39:44.465 --> 39:47.385
if all they ask you is "What's your name,
and your favorite color?"

39:48.636 --> 39:50.763
It sounds like Shannan's running
from her driver.

39:50.847 --> 39:53.016
You can hear him in the 911 call.

39:53.099 --> 39:54.267
[Kim] That makes no sense.

39:54.934 --> 39:58.479
I don't care how fucked up I am,
my ass is going to that driver

39:58.563 --> 39:59.814
because he's my way out.

39:59.898 --> 40:02.108
He's my safety.
That's what you pay him for.

40:04.861 --> 40:07.280
Well, maybe he was mad she didn't pay him.

40:07.363 --> 40:09.407
Why would she all of a sudden
not pay her driver?

40:13.411 --> 40:15.622
Maybe because she was bringing money home.

40:17.582 --> 40:20.209
Okay, do you don't know
she didn't pay him. You're just guessing.

40:20.293 --> 40:21.711
Well, I'm assuming.

40:21.794 --> 40:25.548
She's probably forced to get stoned,
drunk, high--

40:25.632 --> 40:27.425
-Not forced.
-[Mari] Okay, whatever.

40:27.508 --> 40:29.552
[Kim] I'm just saying, I've lived it.

40:29.636 --> 40:31.763
Well, I'm just saying, you're not Shannan.

40:35.516 --> 40:37.226
Mari, I feel for you...

40:38.394 --> 40:39.854
more than I feel for myself

40:39.938 --> 40:43.691
or any of the other ladies here,
because Shannan's still missing.

40:44.984 --> 40:46.945
And knowing is better than not knowing.

40:49.322 --> 40:51.115
But you don't really think that...

41:02.627 --> 41:05.964
I'm just saying it might be good to accept
that there's another ending to all this.

41:07.340 --> 41:09.884
What's that ending,
if you know so goddamned much?

41:17.141 --> 41:18.142
[soda can pops open]

41:48.006 --> 41:48.923
[sighs]

42:02.937 --> 42:04.772
[phone rings]

42:05.898 --> 42:08.026
[ringing continues]

42:10.278 --> 42:11.112
Hello?

42:12.030 --> 42:13.406
[man] <i>Is this Mari Gilbert?</i>

42:14.115 --> 42:14.949
Yes.

42:15.366 --> 42:16.784
<i>My name's Joe Scalise.</i>

42:16.868 --> 42:20.204
<i>I have some information</i>
<i>you're gonna want to hear.</i>

42:21.080 --> 42:24.250
[rain patters]

43:09.462 --> 43:11.464
[engine starts]

43:14.217 --> 43:16.761
[Joe] I'm a neighbor of Joe Brewer,
the john.

43:17.887 --> 43:21.390
I got your number
from one of those fliers you posted.

43:21.474 --> 43:24.310
Suffolk PD don't return my calls no more.

43:25.686 --> 43:28.689
You're gonna learn
that the good people of Oak Beach,

43:29.982 --> 43:32.068
if they live by one thing, it's this:

43:32.151 --> 43:34.195
be wary of those who would...

43:35.988 --> 43:38.491
who would ruin a very good thing.

43:38.574 --> 43:43.162
You are, madam,
the wayfarer they've been dreading.

43:44.163 --> 43:45.414
[exhales sharply]

43:45.498 --> 43:46.332
[sniffs]

43:52.672 --> 43:54.841
[Sherre]
I didn't know Shannan was a prostitute.

43:55.675 --> 43:58.052
I didn't know she was bringing home money.

44:00.096 --> 44:01.889
She doesn't let anyone help her.

44:03.599 --> 44:06.018
I thought we were doing this together.

44:07.812 --> 44:09.605
So fucking annoying.

44:11.065 --> 44:12.358
Sorry.

44:12.441 --> 44:13.943
We weren't following you.

44:14.026 --> 44:15.111
We kind of were.

44:15.194 --> 44:16.487
[chuckles]

44:18.614 --> 44:19.991
What are you two talking about?

44:20.741 --> 44:22.201
Families.

44:22.743 --> 44:23.953
Yeah.

44:25.079 --> 44:26.956
Tell me something nice about Shannan.

44:29.041 --> 44:31.586
She graduated high school two years early.

44:33.254 --> 44:34.505
She was smart.

44:35.381 --> 44:38.217
And she was the first one
in our family to go to college.

44:40.428 --> 44:42.263
I called her "Diva."

44:42.847 --> 44:44.015
[Sherre laughs]

44:44.098 --> 44:45.975
Because she's such a little diva.

44:48.144 --> 44:50.271
Amber stood 4'11"

44:50.354 --> 44:52.732
and weighed 100 pounds soaking wet.

44:52.815 --> 44:54.317
[everyone laughs]

44:54.817 --> 44:57.486
Her legs looked like
little chicken drumsticks.

45:01.949 --> 45:03.951
I spoke to her the day she went missing.

45:04.035 --> 45:04.869
[sighs]

45:07.079 --> 45:08.039
We were in a fight.

45:13.753 --> 45:14.587
[chuckles wryly]

45:21.093 --> 45:22.428
-[sighs]
-[car trunk closes]

45:29.769 --> 45:30.853
[Joe] You're walking through

45:30.937 --> 45:33.064
what used to be
the killer's dumping ground.

45:33.147 --> 45:35.024
He only moved the bodies to the road

45:35.107 --> 45:39.028
because this whole area is set to be
drained as part of the mosquito project.

45:42.114 --> 45:45.451
That means people poking around,
seeing things they shouldn't.

45:50.373 --> 45:51.207
Here.

45:51.874 --> 45:52.750
Look.

45:54.961 --> 45:56.963
This is where he keeps his supplies.

45:58.172 --> 45:59.257
But... where?

46:01.926 --> 46:04.095
[vehicle approaching]

46:04.178 --> 46:05.346
[Joe whispers] Go, go, go.

46:05.429 --> 46:08.182
-[Mari panting]
-[Joe shushes]

46:08.266 --> 46:10.643
-[Joe whispers] Shit like that happens.
-[whispers] What's up?

46:11.811 --> 46:12.853
Oh, God.

46:12.937 --> 46:14.563
Easy. Just...

46:18.234 --> 46:19.110
[car door closes]

46:19.610 --> 46:20.528
[car door lock beeps]

46:28.577 --> 46:31.080
Joe Brewer didn't kill Shannan.

46:32.373 --> 46:35.251
He may be a sociopath,
but he's not the psychopath.

46:35.334 --> 46:37.628
That honor goes to Peter Hackett.

46:40.172 --> 46:41.424
[whispers] Dr. Hackett?

46:49.098 --> 46:51.434
[Dormer] Look, I know you
and your buddies don't give a shit.

46:51.517 --> 46:54.103
Don't worry. You're not gonna have to
put up with me much longer.

46:54.186 --> 46:56.897
But for the moment, this is my case.
Okay?

46:57.398 --> 46:59.734
-I want a suspect. I want a name.
-Okay.

46:59.817 --> 47:02.403
[Mari] Peter Hackett. Dr. Peter Hackett.

47:02.486 --> 47:03.988
He lives in Oak Beach.

47:04.488 --> 47:06.240
It's nice to see you again, Ms. Gilbert.

47:06.324 --> 47:08.909
I saw spools of burlap in a shed
by his house.

47:08.993 --> 47:12.204
Come on. What are you talking about?
Every clammer, contractor, landscaper

47:12.288 --> 47:14.999
-has got burlap by his house. Come on.
-But a doctor?

47:15.708 --> 47:18.836
I tell you what, why don't you let
the policemen do the police work, honey?

47:18.919 --> 47:20.796
-Why don't you suck my dick?
-Classy.

47:20.880 --> 47:22.048
This is the guy who called me

47:22.131 --> 47:24.633
the morning after she disappeared.
He said that he helped her.

47:26.010 --> 47:27.553
Come on. Aren't you gonna write it down?

47:27.636 --> 47:29.388
Are you fucking kidding me? Hmm?

47:30.806 --> 47:31.891
Write it down.

47:31.974 --> 47:32.808
What?

47:33.225 --> 47:35.603
I said write it down.

47:35.686 --> 47:38.230
[man speaking indistinctly on TV]

47:55.748 --> 47:56.582
[door opens]

47:58.584 --> 47:59.418
[door shuts]

48:01.962 --> 48:04.340
[brushing teeth]

48:10.179 --> 48:12.098
I googled Sarra's medication.

48:12.181 --> 48:14.350
So I know it's a mood stabilizer.

48:18.354 --> 48:20.940
She told me you took her
to a psychiatrist.

48:21.357 --> 48:22.525
Why didn't you tell me?

48:23.651 --> 48:24.902
There's nothing to tell.

48:25.945 --> 48:28.697
It takes six weeks for the medication
to have any effect,

48:28.781 --> 48:29.990
so we'll know more then.

49:18.539 --> 49:21.000
[man] Hello. Can I help you?

49:24.003 --> 49:26.088
[hens clucking]

49:26.172 --> 49:28.883
[man] Peter Hackett's the best neighbor
you can have.

49:28.966 --> 49:32.303
Ever there's a problem,
he's always the first one to call.

49:32.386 --> 49:34.763
Do you remember anything from that night?

49:35.598 --> 49:37.766
Yeah,
that girl was pretty well drugged up.

49:37.850 --> 49:40.102
-What?
-She couldn't hardly stand.

49:40.644 --> 49:42.688
-Excuse me?
-She almost fell down twice

49:42.771 --> 49:45.274
-when I was talking to her.
-Wait, you saw her?

49:45.357 --> 49:47.526
-Why didn't you call the police?
-I did.

49:48.944 --> 49:51.614
-What was she saying?
-It wasn't making sense.

49:52.198 --> 49:54.492
"Help me. Help me.
They're going to kill me."

49:55.075 --> 49:56.994
So I sat her down on the porch,

49:57.077 --> 49:59.371
and I said, "Relax."

49:59.455 --> 50:02.750
I told her that I called the police
and they were on their way.

50:03.542 --> 50:05.878
As soon as I said that, she ran.

50:06.545 --> 50:07.546
Anyhow...

50:08.506 --> 50:10.883
-What?
-...she fell down the stairs and...

50:11.800 --> 50:12.843
she ran that way.

50:15.888 --> 50:18.390
[Mari] Wait,
do those security cameras work?

50:37.743 --> 50:39.954
[Mari] Is this where they keep
the security footage?

50:40.496 --> 50:41.830
Are you from the news?

50:41.914 --> 50:44.542
We, unfortunately, don't have it
from that night.

50:44.625 --> 50:47.878
It gets taped over automatically.
It runs on a loop. I'm sorry.

50:47.962 --> 50:49.630
But the police got a copy, right?

50:50.589 --> 50:52.675
[woman] We found it odd they never asked.

50:55.886 --> 50:57.388
I'm sorry, who are you?

51:00.057 --> 51:01.475
Why didn't you give it to them?

51:01.934 --> 51:03.519
Why don't I get my husband?

51:03.602 --> 51:05.229
He oversees all that.

51:05.312 --> 51:07.314
I just came by to drop off his lunch.

51:08.148 --> 51:11.193
[breathes deeply]

51:28.544 --> 51:31.213
How can I help you? Dr. Peter Hackett.

51:32.339 --> 51:34.758
My wife tells me you're a reporter.

51:35.259 --> 51:36.510
I've lived here for 30 years.

51:36.594 --> 51:38.596
There's not a thing I don't know
about Oak Beach.

51:39.305 --> 51:43.809
We're like a miniature government here,
and I pound the gavel. [laughs]

51:47.688 --> 51:49.982
Barbara, why don't you put on some coffee?

51:50.399 --> 51:51.400
It's on, dear.

51:52.484 --> 51:54.069
Then why don't you refresh it?

51:59.199 --> 52:03.704
I, uh... recognize you from the news.

52:04.455 --> 52:05.581
I'm so sorry.

52:07.249 --> 52:09.043
-What happened?
-[Dr. Hackett laughs]

52:09.668 --> 52:12.796
Well, that's the $64,000 question.

52:13.922 --> 52:15.507
But you called me.

52:17.176 --> 52:18.135
I beg your pardon?

52:21.513 --> 52:23.223
[indistinct chatter on police radio]

52:23.349 --> 52:26.518
[dispatch officer on radio] <i>Unit report</i>

52:31.273 --> 52:33.442
[officer] Just arriving.
Going to check it out. Stand by.

52:59.134 --> 53:03.472
We got a 10-54 on Ocean Parkway
near Cedar Beach.

53:06.016 --> 53:06.892
Fuck.

53:12.690 --> 53:13.941
[scanner beeps]

53:21.490 --> 53:24.993
[Mari] Last place Shannan was seen
was in clear view of a video camera,

53:25.077 --> 53:27.413
and Hackett's in charge of the footage!

53:27.496 --> 53:29.498
Okay. I'll look into it.

53:29.581 --> 53:30.749
He erased it.

53:31.750 --> 53:33.377
What? Did you find something?

53:33.460 --> 53:35.129
Mrs. Gilbert,
you really shouldn't be here.

53:35.212 --> 53:37.464
-Can you take her to the road?
-[Mari] What did you find?

53:38.799 --> 53:39.883
Let go of me.

53:40.509 --> 53:41.677
What's in the bag?

53:42.261 --> 53:44.096
[officer]
This one's not like the other four.

53:44.179 --> 53:46.014
Those were in the bramble a mile away.

53:46.557 --> 53:49.476
There's no burlap on this one, either,
or hyoid bones.

53:52.020 --> 53:54.231
[Dormer] Any indication of a jaw plate?

53:54.314 --> 53:55.274
[officer] No, sir.

53:57.735 --> 53:59.194
[Dormer] Right. Let's go.

[door closes]

55:05.385 --> 55:06.386
Kim's working again.

55:07.387 --> 55:10.432
"Carolina" is her street name.
She posted this an hour ago.

55:11.517 --> 55:12.851
[Mari] Oh, Kim.

55:12.935 --> 55:14.311
What is she thinking?

55:19.149 --> 55:20.317
[Dr. Hackett] I'm a busy guy.

55:20.776 --> 55:22.861
I make and take a lot of calls.

55:22.945 --> 55:26.323
But how would I call a woman
I don't even know?

55:26.865 --> 55:27.908
I'm a doctor...

55:28.909 --> 55:30.035
not a magician.

55:33.622 --> 55:36.041
[sighs]
She said that...

55:36.750 --> 55:39.711
that you told her
that you helped her daughter.

55:39.795 --> 55:40.671
[Dr. Hackett chuckles]

55:41.213 --> 55:43.048
I hope she doesn't blame herself

55:44.174 --> 55:45.968
for the life her daughter led.

55:46.927 --> 55:48.095
But...

55:49.429 --> 55:51.765
apples don't fall far from the tree.

55:52.266 --> 55:53.600

[groans]

55:55.561 --> 55:56.395
[sighs]

55:57.062 --> 56:00.941
So, what do you remember from that night?

56:02.025 --> 56:06.113
I think that's when Barbara and I
were in Florida.

56:07.239 --> 56:09.241
-[Dormer] Oh.
-You ever been marlin fishing?

56:09.992 --> 56:10.993
But you were here.

56:11.743 --> 56:15.998
Because when the daughter's boyfriend
came the next morning to look for her,

56:17.207 --> 56:19.585
didn't you offer to help search for her?

56:21.086 --> 56:23.422
Florida might have been...

56:24.673 --> 56:26.675
-the week before.
-Oh, okay.

56:26.758 --> 56:30.012
That's right.
I saw this kid tooling around,

56:30.095 --> 56:33.599
and he told me his story
and I couldn't turn him away.

56:33.682 --> 56:36.184
That's what we do around here,
we help people.

56:38.145 --> 56:41.773
[scoffs]
With all due respect, Dr. Hackett,

56:42.858 --> 56:45.944
you're living in a gated community
with a sign that says:

56:46.028 --> 56:47.821
"Be nice or leave."

56:49.072 --> 56:52.618
I don't know that that sends
that particular message.

56:52.701 --> 56:55.078
Look... the police came.

56:55.162 --> 56:56.997
They said everything was kosher.

56:57.080 --> 56:57.915
Right.

56:59.666 --> 57:00.500
But...

57:02.127 --> 57:05.130
why didn't you show them
the security footage?

57:05.714 --> 57:06.924
Why didn't they ask for it?

57:08.216 --> 57:10.677
This is not my investigation, <i>kemosabe.</i>

57:11.261 --> 57:12.846
You're the head honcho.

57:14.723 --> 57:16.558
Maybe you ought to teach your cops better.

57:18.560 --> 57:19.686
A girl goes missing

57:20.354 --> 57:21.521
and you have a tape.

57:23.857 --> 57:27.861
[scoffs] Are you telling me
that you didn't at least watch it?

57:30.155 --> 57:32.240
That would be tampering with evidence.

57:33.992 --> 57:35.035
Am I right?

58:07.317 --> 58:09.945
[Joe] Peter Hackett
is a self-important blowhard.

58:10.529 --> 58:13.573
The very fact
that he's not leading the charge in this

58:13.657 --> 58:16.493
is all the evidence you need
to point a finger.

58:17.035 --> 58:18.370
[Mari] Okay, if that's true,

58:18.453 --> 58:21.206
why wasn't Shannan found
with the other girls?

58:21.289 --> 58:23.834
[Joe] 'Cause the attack on her
didn't go as planned.

58:23.917 --> 58:25.168
She'd gone off running.

58:25.627 --> 58:27.754
People had seen her. The police came.

58:27.838 --> 58:29.840
It just became too risky.

58:29.923 --> 58:33.301
He tells people
that he runs a home for wayward girls.

58:33.385 --> 58:36.013
That he rehabs them. That he saves them.

58:36.096 --> 58:38.348
What he really means is he buries them.

58:39.182 --> 58:41.893
He's got an examination table
in his living room.

58:42.728 --> 58:45.022

1:15:24.979 --> 1:15:26.188
saving lives.

1:15:29.108 --> 1:15:31.193
If she's out there, we gotta find her.

1:15:35.906 --> 1:15:37.283
You're the real hero.

1:15:39.201 --> 1:15:41.537
A mother who would go to any lengths

1:15:42.705 --> 1:15:43.748
for her daughter.

1:15:46.917 --> 1:15:49.336
That is true heroism.

1:15:56.218 --> 1:15:57.553
-[door shuts]
-[Dormer] Oh.

1:15:58.554 --> 1:15:59.638
Mrs. Gilbert.

1:16:02.224 --> 1:16:03.559
Nice to see you again.

1:16:04.643 --> 1:16:07.104
[Mari] Don't worry.
I left my staple gun at home.

1:16:07.188 --> 1:16:08.022
[chuckles]

1:16:08.731 --> 1:16:10.107
So how did you get in my office?

1:16:11.150 --> 1:16:12.777
It's not your office anymore.

1:16:13.444 --> 1:16:15.154
True. True.

1:16:16.781 --> 1:16:20.826
Yeah, they're putting me out to pasture,
as they say.

1:16:20.910 --> 1:16:23.329
What do you think
you'll be most remembered for?

1:16:24.330 --> 1:16:25.873
What can I help you with?

1:16:29.335 --> 1:16:30.878
Why haven't you searched the marsh?

1:16:31.754 --> 1:16:34.590
It's the only place in Oak Beach
you haven't searched.

1:16:34.673 --> 1:16:37.927
Because a grown man
can't get through there,

1:16:38.010 --> 1:16:40.554
never mind a 100-pound girl.

1:16:40.638 --> 1:16:43.599
Yeah, but it borders Anchor Way
where Shannan was last seen,

1:16:43.682 --> 1:16:46.018
and Larboard Court
where Peter Hackett lives.

1:16:46.102 --> 1:16:48.771
Ah, so this is about Hackett.

1:16:49.396 --> 1:16:51.565
We've already cleared him.

1:16:51.649 --> 1:16:53.943
What... You gotta talk to Joe Scalise.

1:16:54.026 --> 1:16:57.863
Joe Scalise
is a paranoid conspiracy freak.

1:16:57.947 --> 1:16:59.532
He and Hackett hate each other.

1:16:59.615 --> 1:17:01.826
Some dispute they had years ago over land.

1:17:02.409 --> 1:17:03.661
He wants to bury Hackett.

1:17:03.744 --> 1:17:05.079
Maybe he's giving you the shovel.

1:17:05.996 --> 1:17:07.540
What about her jacket?

1:17:08.165 --> 1:17:11.961
If Hackett had contact with Shannan,
her jacket would prove it.

1:17:12.044 --> 1:17:14.922
It would have skin cells
or fibers on it or something.

1:17:17.967 --> 1:17:19.301
We don't have the jacket.

1:17:20.553 --> 1:17:23.055
When they first picked it up,
Shannan wasn't officially missing

1:17:23.139 --> 1:17:24.849
and it got lost.

1:17:27.726 --> 1:17:31.188
What is this, some kind of cover-up
or just incompetence?

1:17:31.772 --> 1:17:33.983
Search the marsh or I'm going on the news.

They failed to keep them safe
when they were at risk.

1:25:37.215 --> 1:25:40.052
They failed to take their disappearances
seriously,

1:25:40.135 --> 1:25:43.472
and they failed to go after the people
who took advantage of our girls.

1:25:43.555 --> 1:25:45.515
Some of them may even be those people.

1:25:46.642 --> 1:25:47.809
<i>And they ignored me,</i>

<i>the night she called for help</i>

<i>and waited an hour for them to arrive.</i>

1:26:01.073 --> 1:26:06.036
Why are our girls to blame
at the exclusion of everybody else?

1:26:08.121 --> 1:26:11.708
