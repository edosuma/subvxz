07:35.163 --> 07:37.291
...of the Bond Foundation?

07:37.332 --> 07:40.127
Bond Plaza?

07:37.332 --> 07:40.127
The Bond Trade Towers?

07:40.168 --> 07:43.171
Uh. The Bond Trade Towers

07:40.168 --> 07:43.171
was my father.

07:43.213 --> 07:46.383
And this was our house

07:43.213 --> 07:46.383
before daddy hit it big.

07:46.425 --> 07:49.261
I lived here the first

07:46.425 --> 07:49.261
12 years of my life.

07:49.303 --> 07:51.638
Lots of marvelous memories.

07:51.679 --> 07:53.514
Really?

07:53.556 --> 07:55.683
Maybe you could explain to me

07:53.556 --> 07:55.683
about the scuff mark

07:55.725 --> 07:57.811
that was on the landing

07:55.725 --> 07:57.811
when we moved in.

08:02.441 --> 08:03.858
Okay, why don't

08:02.441 --> 08:03.858
I show you around?

08:03.900 --> 08:06.111
- Oh, alright.

08:03.900 --> 08:06.111
- Right this way, please.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.238
Alright, if he wants

08:06.153 --> 08:08.238
to have a family meeting

08:08.280 --> 08:10.198
I'll make a list

08:08.280 --> 08:10.198
of complaints.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.117
My first complaint..

08:12.159 --> 08:15.036
...I hate family meetings.

08:15.078 --> 08:18.039
Jess, give it a rest, huh?

08:18.081 --> 08:20.667
Hey, uh, the boys are napping.

08:20.708 --> 08:22.543
And you know what that means?

08:27.257 --> 08:31.052
- Oh, yeah.

08:27.257 --> 08:31.052
- We get to use the<i> slide.</i>

08:31.094 --> 08:33.388
- No, honey. I wanna go first.

08:31.094 --> 08:33.388
- I'm go first.

08:33.430 --> 08:35.640
No, no! Let me go first!

08:35.682 --> 08:37.142
No, you get back here

08:35.682 --> 08:37.142
right now.

08:37.184 --> 08:39.019
The ears. Ow. Ow. Ow.

08:39.060 --> 08:42.230
'Ow. Ow. Ha. Ha. Ha.'

08:42.272 --> 08:47.027
Guys...I hope we're not

08:42.272 --> 08:47.027
interrupting anything weird.

08:48.069 --> 08:50.030
No problem.

08:51.656 --> 08:55.202
Uh, Jesse, Rebecca,

08:51.656 --> 08:55.202
this is, uh, Lou.

08:55.243 --> 08:56.495
Bond Lou.

08:57.371 --> 08:59.080
I screwed that up, didn't I?

08:59.122 --> 09:00.665
- How do you do, Lou?

08:59.122 --> 09:00.665
- How do you do?

09:00.707 --> 09:02.250
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.250
- Nice to meet you.

09:02.292 --> 09:04.336
Ah, uh, Mr. Bond actually

09:02.292 --> 09:04.336
grew up in this house.

09:04.378 --> 09:05.504
- Really.

09:04.378 --> 09:05.504
- Oh, look.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.255
They're still there

09:07.297 --> 09:10.008
the initials I carved

09:07.297 --> 09:10.008
in the beam

09:10.050 --> 09:13.928
B. L. B.

09:13.970 --> 09:17.140
Uh, Mr. Tanner, I'd, uh, like to

09:13.970 --> 09:17.140
talk to you about something.

09:17.182 --> 09:19.642
What do you say to cigars

09:17.182 --> 09:19.642
on the back porch?

09:20.601 --> 09:21.895
I'd say, "Hello, cigars

09:21.936 --> 09:24.022
it's a lovely evening

09:21.936 --> 09:24.022
we're having, isn't it."

09:27.942 --> 09:30.653
Little cigar humor.

09:27.942 --> 09:30.653
Kind of a joke.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.614
Good one.

09:36.201 --> 09:38.453
No, no, no!

09:38.495 --> 09:40.038
[instrumental music]

09:41.622 --> 09:43.124
Okay.

09:43.166 --> 09:44.876
You all know, I called this

09:43.166 --> 09:44.876
little family meeting

09:44.918 --> 09:46.961
because we've all be getting

09:44.918 --> 09:46.961
on each other's nerves.

09:47.003 --> 09:48.588
Which is bound to happen

09:47.003 --> 09:48.588
when so many nerves

09:48.629 --> 09:50.882
live so close together.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.342
What I'm about to say

09:50.924 --> 09:52.342
might actually

09:52.384 --> 09:53.676
solve everyone's problems.

09:53.718 --> 09:57.138
We're sending Michelle

09:53.718 --> 09:57.138
to harmonica camp?

09:57.180 --> 10:00.725
We're sending you

09:57.180 --> 10:00.725
to be-a-nicer-sister camp!

10:00.767 --> 10:02.643
Girls, girls, girls, make up.

10:02.685 --> 10:04.229
Okay, now that's taken care of.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.189
On the more important matters.

10:06.231 --> 10:07.524
Alright.

10:07.566 --> 10:08.942
[clears throat]

10:08.983 --> 10:11.111
"Lack of consideration..

10:11.152 --> 10:13.905
"...on March 4, 1989,

10:11.152 --> 10:13.905
Danny paints the banister

10:13.947 --> 10:15.782
"without telling anyone.

10:15.823 --> 10:17.784
"I slide down said banister

10:23.123 --> 10:24.624
Jess, I still have

10:23.123 --> 10:24.624
the floor here.

10:24.665 --> 10:25.792
Fine, if you gonna

10:24.665 --> 10:25.792
have the floor

10:25.833 --> 10:27.586
and you're gonna wax it,

10:25.833 --> 10:27.586
tell us.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.130
Okay. Alright.

10:30.171 --> 10:32.924
Now, as you all know,

10:30.171 --> 10:32.924
Mr. Bond

10:32.966 --> 10:34.717
Lou Bond..

10:34.759 --> 10:36.470
...is a very wealthy man.

10:36.511 --> 10:38.472
Now, he has everything

10:36.511 --> 10:38.472
he's ever wanted

10:38.513 --> 10:39.598
his entire life

10:39.639 --> 10:41.182
except for one thing.

10:41.224 --> 10:43.893
To live here in the house

10:41.224 --> 10:43.893
he grew up in.

10:43.935 --> 10:46.729
Forget it. There's enough people

10:43.935 --> 10:46.729
living here already.

10:48.523 --> 10:50.650
He's sharing your bathroom.

10:50.691 --> 10:53.487
[chuckles]

10:50.691 --> 10:53.487
No, guys, he doesn't wanna

10:50.691 --> 10:53.487
live here with us.

10:53.528 --> 10:54.862
He wants to buy the house.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.697
- He wants to buy our house?

10:54.904 --> 10:56.697
- What?

10:56.739 --> 10:58.533
Yes. Yes, and he's offering me

10:56.739 --> 10:58.533
twice what it's worth.

10:58.575 --> 11:00.201
- Wow!

10:58.575 --> 11:00.201
- 'Are you serious?'

11:00.243 --> 11:02.454
Yeah, which means we could buy

11:00.243 --> 11:02.454
an even bigger house

11:02.496 --> 11:03.704
in this exact same

11:02.496 --> 11:03.704
neighborhood.

11:03.746 --> 11:04.789
and then may-be we wouldn't

11:04.831 --> 11:06.249
drive each other so crazy maybe.

11:06.291 --> 11:08.709
- That's a great idea.

11:06.291 --> 11:08.709
- Let's do that.

11:08.751 --> 11:11.671
- I can have my own room.

11:08.751 --> 11:11.671
- I can have my own bathroom.

11:11.712 --> 11:13.340
I can have my own kitchen,

11:11.712 --> 11:13.340
I can have my own living room

11:13.381 --> 11:14.633
I can have my own backyard.

11:14.673 --> 11:17.260
Honey, it's called the house.

11:17.302 --> 11:18.345
That's what I'm saying, I mean..

11:18.386 --> 11:19.471
You know, we've been

11:18.386 --> 11:19.471
talking about

11:19.513 --> 11:21.097
moving to our own

11:19.513 --> 11:21.097
house someday.

11:21.139 --> 11:23.517
Maybe-maybe that someday is now.

11:23.558 --> 11:25.810
Well, the boys could use

11:23.558 --> 11:25.810
some more growing space.

11:25.852 --> 11:27.937
I mean, they're not getting

11:25.852 --> 11:27.937
any shorter.

11:27.979 --> 11:30.607
I'm definitely ready

11:27.979 --> 11:30.607
to move into my own place.

11:30.649 --> 11:32.442
After all, I'm a grown man.

11:32.484 --> 11:35.945
Plus I need more

11:32.484 --> 11:35.945
shelf space for my toys.

11:35.987 --> 11:38.114
[laughs]

11:35.987 --> 11:38.114
You know, what I think this is

11:35.987 --> 11:38.114
the first family meeting

11:38.156 --> 11:40.325
where we all actually

11:38.156 --> 11:40.325
agree on something.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.700
Well, that-that's it then.

11:41.742 --> 11:43.620
I mean, we're-we're out of here.

11:41.742 --> 11:43.620
We're moving.

11:43.662 --> 11:46.540
- This is great.

11:43.662 --> 11:46.540
- I can't believe it.

11:46.581 --> 11:48.542
I'm gonna have

11:46.581 --> 11:48.542
my own bathroom.

11:48.583 --> 11:50.918
(D.J.)

11:48.583 --> 11:50.918
'I don't have to share

11:48.583 --> 11:50.918
with Joey anymore.'

12:00.679 --> 12:02.639
Look, Jess, look at this house

12:00.679 --> 12:02.639
on Linwood Street.

12:02.681 --> 12:04.182
- It's got a big backyard..

12:02.681 --> 12:04.182
- Huh.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.142
- Central air..

12:04.224 --> 12:06.142
- Hmm.

12:06.184 --> 12:07.352
And a hot tub.

12:07.394 --> 12:10.104
Ooh, a hot tub.

12:07.394 --> 12:10.104
I love hot tubs.

12:10.146 --> 12:11.398
Hey, hey, boys.

12:11.439 --> 12:13.316
How would you like

12:11.439 --> 12:13.316
to live in a house

12:13.358 --> 12:14.609
with a hot tub?

12:14.651 --> 12:17.278
What's a hot tub?

12:17.320 --> 12:18.946
It's cool. I-I-it's like,

12:17.320 --> 12:18.946
uh, it's like, uh

12:18.988 --> 12:20.114
a really big bathtub.

12:20.156 --> 12:22.158
No bath.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.660
No way.

12:25.786 --> 12:29.249
No, no, guys,

12:25.786 --> 12:29.249
this tub is outside

12:29.290 --> 12:31.501
and you don't

12:29.290 --> 12:31.501
have to use soap.

12:31.543 --> 12:33.587
Now you tell me.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.717
Oh, hey, Michelle,

12:36.423 --> 12:38.717
hot tub party

12:38.757 --> 12:40.968
our new house,

12:38.757 --> 12:40.968
be there.

12:41.010 --> 12:42.637
You got a new house

12:41.010 --> 12:42.637
already?

12:42.679 --> 12:44.305
No we don't have it yet,

12:42.679 --> 12:44.305
but we're just, uh

12:44.347 --> 12:46.433
we're looking, I mean, it's kind

12:44.347 --> 12:46.433
of fun to think about, huh?

12:46.474 --> 12:48.767
Yeah. I can't stop

12:46.474 --> 12:48.767
thinking about it.

12:48.809 --> 12:50.604
Good.

12:50.645 --> 12:52.731
- What do you got?

12:50.645 --> 12:52.731
- Hey, Jess, look at this.

12:52.813 --> 12:55.858
This house has central

12:52.813 --> 12:55.858
blow-drying.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.360
Let me see that.

12:57.402 --> 12:59.153
Let me..

12:57.402 --> 12:59.153
Where?

12:59.195 --> 13:01.197
Gotcha.

13:01.239 --> 13:02.823
So my mom says if you

13:01.239 --> 13:02.823
buy a condo

13:02.865 --> 13:04.117
from her real estate office

13:04.158 --> 13:05.577
I get half the commission

13:05.619 --> 13:07.828
plus one of those

13:05.619 --> 13:07.828
really cool yellow jackets.

13:07.870 --> 13:09.289
Hmm.

13:09.330 --> 13:11.874
Oh, hey,

13:09.330 --> 13:11.874
look at this one, huh?

13:11.916 --> 13:13.293
Natural Meadows.

13:13.334 --> 13:16.379
Yeah, yeah, I sold

13:13.334 --> 13:16.379
one of those yesterday.

13:16.421 --> 13:18.548
Wow, and look at all

13:16.421 --> 13:18.548
these cool activities

13:18.590 --> 13:19.716
lawn bowling

13:19.758 --> 13:22.719
shuffleboard,

13:19.758 --> 13:22.719
tether ball.

13:22.761 --> 13:25.138
Oh, and look

13:22.761 --> 13:25.138
how happy everyone is.

13:26.556 --> 13:27.599
That's 'cause

13:26.556 --> 13:27.599
they're all naked.

13:27.641 --> 13:29.476
It's a nudist colony.

13:30.977 --> 13:32.604
Oh, my God!

13:32.646 --> 13:35.356
I better give Father O'Connell

13:32.646 --> 13:35.356
his check back.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.778
[harmonica music]

13:46.576 --> 13:47.744
Thanks.

13:47.786 --> 13:50.497
I was playing the blues.

13:51.790 --> 13:56.127
I liked the part

13:51.790 --> 13:56.127
when the spit shot out.

13:56.169 --> 13:57.836
When I decorate my own room

13:57.878 --> 13:59.422
I'm gonna put my bed

13:57.878 --> 13:59.422
by my window

13:59.464 --> 14:00.757
my dress above my door

14:00.799 --> 14:03.134
and Michelle

14:00.799 --> 14:03.134
down the hall.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.512
Ha ha ha.

14:05.553 --> 14:06.805
Michelle, when we move out

14:06.845 --> 14:08.306
you're gonna have your own room.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.350
If Stephanie comes in,

14:08.348 --> 14:10.350
you can throw her out.

14:10.391 --> 14:13.102
Can I practice now?

14:15.271 --> 14:17.106
Later, dad said

14:15.271 --> 14:17.106
we have to clean up

14:17.148 --> 14:19.526
because tonight Mr. Bond's

14:17.148 --> 14:19.526
coming for an inspection.

14:19.567 --> 14:21.486
What's he inspecting for?

14:21.528 --> 14:22.821
Well, he has to check

14:21.528 --> 14:22.821
everything out

14:22.862 --> 14:23.904
make sure everything's perfect
