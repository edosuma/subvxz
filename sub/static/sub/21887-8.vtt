36:20.017 --> 36:22.184
All I did was my job, same as you.

36:38.239 --> 36:41.544
You just better hope you can
pay up when your bill's due.

36:42.891 --> 36:44.302
And it'll come due.

Ah. You've met Martin, I see.

37:13.695 --> 37:15.937
Shh. He's practicing.

37:15.939 --> 37:17.772
No. It's up.

Upward, Martin, so that way you drive

ribs and into the heart.

Urgent matters, Mr. Cobblepot.

37:36.726 --> 37:40.294
It seems that Ms. Kean and
her associates have failed

37:40.296 --> 37:42.463
to retrieve Mr. Nygma.

37:42.465 --> 37:44.713
Did you dispatch Firefly?

37:44.716 --> 37:45.666
I did.

37:45.668 --> 37:49.153
And Ms. Firefly was
herself, in turn, disabled.

There's more.

The mayor,

37:55.322 --> 37:57.511

to the rank... of captain.

[CLEARS THROAT]

38:12.362 --> 38:15.763
That is... quite a lot

38:15.766 --> 38:17.630

Business is not the end-all of life.

38:29.345 --> 38:31.512
There are other rewards to be had.

38:31.514 --> 38:33.748
Companionship, peace of mind.

Oh, I have to get back to the estate.

do for the fund-raiser.

Will you be joining me later for dinner?

38:46.429 --> 38:48.296
I think not.

Okay.

Martin,

38:59.676 --> 39:01.742
remind me.

39:01.744 --> 39:04.011
What did we learn today?

39:04.013 --> 39:07.148
What did we learn about friendship?

39:13.028 --> 39:15.990
Exactly. Sometimes,

39:15.992 --> 39:18.044
if you're not very careful,

39:18.047 --> 39:19.727
friendship can blind you

39:19.729 --> 39:21.629
to what is staring
you right in the face.

You're the only thing
that stinks around here."

They're, uh...

40:11.739 --> 40:15.082
They're acknowledging their new leader.

Well, like I said, they love you.

40:18.270 --> 40:21.589
Uh, Lee, I'm supposed
to be the stupid one.

40:21.591 --> 40:23.549
You heal their children.

You stitch up their warriors.

You've slain a fire-breathing monster,

I'm not here to celebrate.

you captain, didn't I?
