We are doing this.

09:54.546 --> 09:57.129
And...that wasn't
a documentary.

09:57.229 --> 09:58.650
- Dude.
[phone buzzing]

09:58.750 --> 10:00.852
Kaia's calling you?
Nice.

10:00.952 --> 10:02.814
Pick it up. Pick it up.
Pick it up. Pick it up.

10:02.914 --> 10:04.095
Pick it up. Pick it up.
Pick it up.

10:04.195 --> 10:05.617
- Yeah, she can
leave a message.

10:05.717 --> 10:08.619
- Oh, I see you.
Making her wait for it.

10:08.719 --> 10:10.541
I see you, playa.
Playa play.

10:10.641 --> 10:12.343
- This is hell.

10:12.443 --> 10:14.105
Now I know
what hell feels like.

10:14.205 --> 10:16.267
People will say,
"See you in hell,"

10:16.367 --> 10:19.510
and I'll say, "Already
been there. In my Mini Cooper."

10:19.610 --> 10:21.351
- Zoey, we're definitely going
the wrong way.

10:21.451 --> 10:23.273
- This is exactly how
most horror movies start.

10:23.373 --> 10:24.995
- "Hello, Satan.

10:25.095 --> 10:27.257
Yeah. No, it's warm down here."

10:30.820 --> 10:32.882
- Siri, is "Blair Witch" real?

10:32.982 --> 10:34.444
- [softly]
Okay.

10:34.544 --> 10:37.166
[rock music]

10:37.266 --> 10:39.008
- Hey, guys.
Hey. What's up?

10:39.108 --> 10:40.770
Is this a good time?
- Hey, dude. Yeah.

10:40.870 --> 10:42.091
Yeah, come on in.
- Great.

10:42.191 --> 10:43.973
- Brock, Karan,
this is Zoey's brother.

10:44.073 --> 10:45.454
- I also go by David.

10:45.554 --> 10:47.696
This is Miles.
This is a--

10:47.796 --> 10:49.818
it's a nice studio
you got here.

10:49.918 --> 10:51.460
Really a sweet setup. Yeah.

10:51.560 --> 10:54.543
Who's tickling your ivories?

10:54.643 --> 10:58.266
I mean, is anyone on keyboards?

10:58.366 --> 11:00.869
- Oh, we don't have
a keyboard player.

11:00.969 --> 11:02.590
- I just mess around with it
sometimes.

11:02.690 --> 11:04.632
It was my dad's.

11:04.732 --> 11:07.335
[playing smoothly]

11:09.577 --> 11:11.679
- Just a little taste.

11:11.779 --> 11:13.681
- You're welcome to come
jam with us if you want.

11:13.781 --> 11:14.682
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

11:14.782 --> 11:16.684
- Oh, how about now?

11:16.784 --> 11:18.005
[tuning]

11:18.105 --> 11:19.967
Actually,
on further reflection,

11:20.067 --> 11:22.249
my chest just got warm.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.411
Looks like this little guy
needs a quick change

11:24.511 --> 11:26.132
between sets, but, uh,

11:26.232 --> 11:30.016
we'll just pick this up
on the flipside.

11:30.116 --> 11:32.118
[whispers]
Daddy's gonna be in the band.

11:33.159 --> 11:34.340
- Okay, everyone.

11:34.440 --> 11:36.382
Tomorrow night, it begins.

11:36.482 --> 11:37.944
But just to refresh,

11:38.044 --> 11:40.186
this is a warm
and welcoming atmosphere.

11:40.286 --> 11:41.907
Be complimentary,
but don't hover.

11:42.007 --> 11:44.069
I hate that.
And above all,

11:44.169 --> 11:46.632
I don't wanna hear anyone
ask a customer,

11:46.732 --> 11:48.353
"Are you still working
on your meal?"

11:48.453 --> 11:50.956
[enunciates]
A meal is not work.

11:51.056 --> 11:52.677
Capisce?

11:52.777 --> 11:55.080
Capisce. Okay.

11:55.180 --> 11:57.402
Wow, this inspection
is really thorough

11:57.502 --> 11:59.404
and...taking a while.
We all good?

11:59.504 --> 12:01.406
- No.

12:01.506 --> 12:03.007
You can't have
permanent extension cords

12:03.107 --> 12:05.610
taped to the floor, the
installations in the ceiling

12:05.710 --> 12:07.211
are too close
to the sprinklers,

12:07.311 --> 12:09.293
and this one probably feels
like I'm stating the obvious,

12:09.393 --> 12:12.096
but you cannot bejewel
an exit sign.

12:12.196 --> 12:14.218
- Uh-uh, it is not "bejeweled."

12:14.318 --> 12:16.019
It is bedazzled.

12:16.119 --> 12:17.781
- It's a code violation.

12:17.881 --> 12:19.302
You also have
to eliminate three tables

12:19.402 --> 12:20.744
to allow egress
to the front door,

12:20.844 --> 12:23.587
but I can live with them
on that platform.

12:23.687 --> 12:24.908
- Oh, my God.
You are killing me now.

12:25.008 --> 12:27.390
This is not a platform.
It's a stage.

12:27.490 --> 12:29.792
I need a stage.
- Obviously.

12:29.892 --> 12:31.634
- You know what?
You're right.

12:31.734 --> 12:33.676
Safety first.

12:33.776 --> 12:35.117
But it'll be a bit
of a tight squeeze

12:35.217 --> 12:36.839
what with our opening
tomorrow night.

12:36.939 --> 12:38.921
Maybe we can negotiate?

12:39.021 --> 12:41.844
Like an IOU?

12:41.944 --> 12:45.567
- When you find a way
to negotiate with fire,

12:45.667 --> 12:47.249
please let me know.

12:47.349 --> 12:48.450
But in the meantime, no permit

12:48.550 --> 12:51.413
until all of these fixes

12:51.513 --> 12:53.515
have been made.

12:54.155 --> 12:56.778
- Yes, sir.

12:56.878 --> 12:58.459
I told you we need
to allow egress.

12:58.559 --> 13:00.561
- Boy, hush.

13:03.604 --> 13:04.986
- Couldn't we have brought
a telescope

13:05.086 --> 13:07.388
from, I don't know,
like, this millennia?

13:07.488 --> 13:09.270
My birding goggles
are more effective.

13:09.370 --> 13:11.992
- Okay, well, it was my...

13:12.092 --> 13:14.595
It was a gift.
- How old is this blanket?

13:14.695 --> 13:17.157
It's got a "My Little Pony"
Band-Aid stuck to it.

13:17.257 --> 13:19.159
- Can you guys just stop
complaining about everything?

13:19.259 --> 13:20.640
I am trying
to create a tableau here

13:20.740 --> 13:23.403
and I want it...
the way that I want it.

13:23.503 --> 13:26.366
Okay? So that's this blanket,
this telescope,

13:26.466 --> 13:29.889
these sandwiches,
this meteor shower.

13:29.989 --> 13:31.771
- Okay.
- [sighs]

13:31.871 --> 13:35.254
- Okay, here I am looking at it
with my naked eye.

13:35.354 --> 13:37.356
And now...

13:39.518 --> 13:42.020
It looks a tiny bit bigger.

13:42.120 --> 13:44.102
Yeah, this is way better
than scrimmaging

13:44.202 --> 13:47.345
with Go Axe Alice.

13:47.445 --> 13:50.669
Wait a second.
I think something's happening.

13:50.769 --> 13:52.190
- Tobin, let me look at it.

you can go view it at?

to read it for you.

Yeah. That could work.

for the ribbon cutting.

Hey there, Leif.

17:20.166 --> 17:21.907

"a once-in-a-generation feast
for the eyes,"

to axe us from the team.

He'll calm down.

17:31.697 --> 17:32.878

- Yeah.

17:32.978 --> 17:34.920
Can't believe we missed it.

17:35.020 --> 17:37.722
So I noticed,

17:37.822 --> 17:40.005
you seemed pretty distracted

17:40.105 --> 17:42.567
by that girl, Kaia,
calling you.

17:42.667 --> 17:44.729
- Of course you noticed that.
Right.

17:44.829 --> 17:47.131
And whatever superpower
you have, I want it.

17:47.231 --> 17:48.493
- [chuckles nervously]
It's yours.

17:48.593 --> 17:50.855
Take it.

17:50.955 --> 17:52.536
- [dramatically]
I'm starving!

17:52.636 --> 17:54.738
Walk with me.
- Okay.

17:54.838 --> 17:56.220
- Get me something
with rice in it.

17:56.320 --> 17:58.262
- After Joan,
I had a really hard time

17:58.362 --> 18:00.584
putting myself out there,
but eventually, I said

18:00.684 --> 18:02.346
I had to start dating again.

18:02.446 --> 18:06.189
So I met Kaia online, we had
this great text exchange

18:06.289 --> 18:08.912
for, like, two months
before we decided to meet IRL.

18:09.012 --> 18:11.754
In real life.
- I know what that means.

18:11.854 --> 18:13.836
- So we decided
to go to Marlowe B's,

18:13.936 --> 18:16.519
which is like the apex
of molecular gastronomy.

18:16.619 --> 18:18.080
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Isn't that the place

18:18.180 --> 18:20.923
with the nitrogen-infused
"foam burger"?

18:21.023 --> 18:22.765
- Yeah.
You eat it with a straw.

18:22.865 --> 18:25.047
So we go to the bar

18:25.147 --> 18:27.249
to have a drink
while we wait for our table,

18:27.349 --> 18:29.892
and she gets this text

18:29.992 --> 18:32.734
and says she has to go because
her grandma had a stroke

18:32.834 --> 18:35.457
and died.
- That's terrible.

18:35.557 --> 18:37.018
- Yeah, if it were true.

18:37.118 --> 18:38.580
But she just wasn't into me,

18:38.680 --> 18:41.342
so she made up an excuse
and bailed.

18:41.442 --> 18:44.465
And I haven't been
on a single date since.

18:44.565 --> 18:47.188
- Okay, but...

18:47.288 --> 18:49.550
she called you again,
didn't she?

18:49.650 --> 18:51.952
So whatever happened
in the past,

18:52.052 --> 18:54.234
it sounds like the universe
is giving you another shot

18:54.334 --> 18:55.876
with Kaia.

18:55.976 --> 18:57.878
And we're gonna take it.

18:57.978 --> 18:59.980
- We are?
- We are!

19:01.942 --> 19:02.963
- I'm confused.

19:03.063 --> 19:04.324

28:51.937 --> 28:53.959
- And the thing is,
I just--I wanted

28:54.059 --> 28:56.282
to recreate
that special memory,

28:56.382 --> 28:59.444
but, I mean, how can
I leave Leif like this?

28:59.544 --> 29:02.267
It's my fault that
he asked her out again.

29:04.950 --> 29:06.771
I'm sorry to be such a burden.

29:06.871 --> 29:08.493
- Do you know who's a burden?

29:08.593 --> 29:11.135
My mother, who thinks I still
haven't found the right girl.

29:11.235 --> 29:14.339
You, darling, are
a walk in the park.

29:14.439 --> 29:16.581
- Zoey! What up?

29:16.681 --> 29:18.663
Came by to see how my boy
Leif's doing on his date.

29:18.763 --> 29:20.344
And to get some of that
sweet discounted food

29:20.444 --> 29:21.625
Max promised us.

29:21.725 --> 29:23.067
- I need a drink.
- [screams weakly]

29:23.167 --> 29:25.469
- Tobin, what douchey cocktail
can I buy you?

29:25.569 --> 29:26.990
- Hot Toddy
and a cup of cherries.

29:27.090 --> 29:28.912
You trying to get me drunk?
- Trying to get me drunk.

29:29.012 --> 29:31.835
Just hate doing it alone.

29:31.935 --> 29:34.077
- You saw that, right?

29:34.177 --> 29:36.559
What's wrong with you?
You look unhappier than usual.

29:36.659 --> 29:38.361
- Leif's date
isn't going so well.

29:38.461 --> 29:39.963
- What?
- Turns out

29:40.063 --> 29:43.086
Kaia's just networking,
but Leif thinks it's "game on."

29:43.186 --> 29:45.208
- No, no, no, no.
This is not good, Zoey.

29:45.308 --> 29:46.809
It took him a month
to get back on solids

29:46.909 --> 29:48.290
after Joan dumped him.

29:48.390 --> 29:50.613
Who knows what this will do?
I gotta warn him--

29:50.713 --> 29:53.055
- No, let me.
This is my fault.

29:53.155 --> 29:55.017
I'm the one
who pushed him into this,

29:55.117 --> 29:57.119
so I will take care of it.

30:03.365 --> 30:05.307
- Hey, so tell me everything
she said.

30:05.407 --> 30:07.629
10 bucks says she used
the word "electric."

30:07.729 --> 30:09.751
- Kaia's not into you.
She's looking for a job.

30:09.851 --> 30:12.273
And...you work at Sprqpoint,

30:12.373 --> 30:13.634
and she thinks
you're gonna hook her up,

30:13.734 --> 30:16.077
so...

30:16.177 --> 30:18.399
She thinks I'm a waitress.
- Wait.

30:18.499 --> 30:20.521
You're the one who told me
to go out with her again.

30:20.621 --> 30:23.083
And now, you're telling me
she's using me as a reference?

30:23.183 --> 30:25.125
- [sighs]
I'm really sorry.

30:25.225 --> 30:27.768
I am. I was actually
trying to help,

30:27.868 --> 30:30.050
but I don't want this
to get you down

30:30.150 --> 30:31.852
because you are
a really great guy

30:31.952 --> 30:33.733
and you don't deserve
to get hurt again.

30:33.833 --> 30:36.015
- Then why are you trying
to hurt me?

30:36.115 --> 30:38.458
All right, I don't know
what game you're playing,

30:38.558 --> 30:41.380
but I don't like it, okay?

30:41.480 --> 30:43.482
I'll take it from here.

30:48.007 --> 30:49.548
- [laughs]
- Hello.

30:49.648 --> 30:51.230
How's everybody's night going?

30:51.330 --> 30:53.432
Any compliments
I should relay to the owner?

30:53.532 --> 30:55.674
Speak freely.
- Guys, this is my friend, Max.

30:55.774 --> 30:57.956
Max, these are my friends,
Ildiko and Alyssa.

30:58.056 --> 31:00.078
- This place is spectacular.

31:00.178 --> 31:01.439
What inspired the murals?

31:01.539 --> 31:03.121
- Oh, that's all
my business partner, Mo.

31:03.221 --> 31:04.843
He's the artist.
I'm more of the

31:04.943 --> 31:06.444
app designer/man in the corner

31:06.544 --> 31:08.726
praying this wasn't
a horrible mistake...guy.

31:08.826 --> 31:09.807
[laughter]

31:09.907 --> 31:10.968
- Max and I went
to camp together.

31:11.068 --> 31:12.690
He was my first kiss ever.

31:12.790 --> 31:14.732
- Well, only in a skit
about water safety.

31:14.832 --> 31:15.973
- That still counts.

31:16.073 --> 31:17.695
I tried to drown myself
during Color War

31:17.795 --> 31:19.136
so you'd give me
mouth-to-mouth again.

31:19.236 --> 31:21.238
- I tried to down myself once.

31:23.040 --> 31:25.462
- Oh, uh, please.
It's on the house.

31:25.562 --> 31:26.703
- Thank you.
That's very nice of you.

31:26.803 --> 31:28.425
- Oh. Camp pride.

31:28.525 --> 31:30.907
So I guess,
have a nice trip back?

31:31.007 --> 31:32.389
- I'm actually here
for a couple months.

31:32.489 --> 31:34.270
I'm installing a show
at SF MoMA.

31:34.370 --> 31:35.872
- Well, I am

31:35.972 --> 31:38.594
SF excited.

31:38.694 --> 31:40.516
- We should hang out, right?
- Yeah.

31:40.616 --> 31:42.638
Well, since we clearly both
follow each other on the 'gram,

31:42.738 --> 31:44.960
I guess DM me?
- Yeah.

31:45.060 --> 31:47.062
Okay.
- Bye, Rose.

32:01.676 --> 32:03.378
- There you are.

32:03.478 --> 32:06.140
Hey, so I went to a thing.

32:06.240 --> 32:08.903
And then, I left
so that I could see you.

32:09.003 --> 32:11.345
And the restaurant, yeah,
but mainly you.

32:11.445 --> 32:13.988
And wow.
You look amazing.

32:14.088 --> 32:17.111
- Oh. Simon Haynes,
are you tipsy?

32:17.211 --> 32:19.032
- I was at a fundraiser
with an open bar,

32:19.132 --> 32:22.155
so probably, but I stand
by every word I said.

32:22.255 --> 32:24.918
- Hmm, Mr. Haynes.

32:25.018 --> 32:27.080
Look at you
looking all extra fly.

32:27.180 --> 32:29.602
- Ooh! Zoey did ask me
to dress nice,

32:29.702 --> 32:31.404
so how'd I do?

32:31.504 --> 32:33.886
- I'm not mad at it.

32:33.986 --> 32:36.249
- Oh! Well,
why are you still here?

32:36.349 --> 32:38.451
Aren't you supposed to be
at, like, Nerd-a-palooza?

32:38.551 --> 32:40.453
- Oh, not anymore.
I missed my window.

32:40.553 --> 32:43.255
It's okay.
They'll be back. Someday.

32:43.355 --> 32:44.897
- Mo?

32:44.997 --> 32:47.099
Hey, I think now's a good time
to speak to everybody.

32:47.199 --> 32:48.500
Shall we?
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

32:48.600 --> 32:51.143
If you all just
take one moment and...

32:51.243 --> 32:54.506
acknowledge
what you've done here.

32:54.606 --> 32:56.508
I mean, look at this! Look!

32:56.608 --> 32:59.110
All kinds of food.
All kinds of people.

32:59.210 --> 33:00.431
I mean, this is
a beautiful thing

33:00.531 --> 33:01.793
that you both put together,

33:01.893 --> 33:03.755
and I just wanna say how

33:03.855 --> 33:05.556
proud I am

33:05.656 --> 33:08.439
of the both of you.

33:08.539 --> 33:11.081
- Baby, you are drunk,
and I love it.

33:11.181 --> 33:12.443
- I--
[laughter]

33:12.543 --> 33:13.884
- Now, can we do this?
- Yes.

33:13.984 --> 33:15.806
- Okay. Can we have
everyone's attention, please?

33:15.906 --> 33:16.927
- Speech!

33:17.027 --> 33:18.448
- Uh,

33:18.548 --> 33:20.651
we wanted to make a quick toast

33:20.751 --> 33:22.933
to everyone who contributed
to tonight.

33:23.033 --> 33:25.735
- We wanted to create a space
that celebrated inclusivity

33:25.835 --> 33:27.257
from the food that we served

33:27.357 --> 33:29.138
to our entire wait staff

33:29.238 --> 33:31.220
to the people that we welcome
through our doors,

33:31.320 --> 33:33.903
so thank each and every one
of you for being here tonight.

33:34.003 --> 33:36.846
[cheers and applause]

33:38.127 --> 33:40.069
- Especially Zoey Clarke,

33:40.169 --> 33:41.951
who helped us form
our partnership

33:42.051 --> 33:43.712
and find our main investor--

33:43.812 --> 33:46.555
her boss and Sprqpoint CEO,
Danny Michael Davis.

33:46.655 --> 33:49.438
[cheers and applause]

33:49.538 --> 33:51.800
- Wait, she works
at Sprqpoint?

33:51.900 --> 33:54.643
- Yeah, she's my boss.

33:54.743 --> 33:57.605
- You have to introduce me.

33:57.705 --> 33:59.087
[glass clinking]

33:59.187 --> 34:01.049
- Oh, did Danny Michael Davis
have anything

34:01.149 --> 34:02.770
he wanted to say?
- Oh, yeah. Let me check.

34:02.870 --> 34:04.732
Uh, yeah, it just came in.
- Oh.

34:04.832 --> 34:06.173
- "Max and Mo,

34:06.273 --> 34:08.295
"I'm sorry I couldn't be
with you tonight.

34:08.395 --> 34:10.698
I'm in Telluride
with my probation officer."

34:10.798 --> 34:12.419
- Oh, boy.
- "But I want you both to know

34:12.519 --> 34:15.542
"that your stars
have been on the rise

34:15.642 --> 34:17.744
"since the day you decided
to launch this idea

34:17.844 --> 34:19.186
"into the stratosphere.

34:19.286 --> 34:22.309
"Your future shines as bright
as a supernova,

34:22.409 --> 34:25.311
and I know your success
will be meteoric."

34:25.411 --> 34:26.753
Huh.

34:26.853 --> 34:29.315
There's a lot of
celestial language in here.

34:29.415 --> 34:30.797
- Wrap it up, Red!
- Sorry.

34:30.897 --> 34:32.758
[laughter]

34:32.858 --> 34:34.920
"And if you're wondering

34:35.020 --> 34:38.244
"why I'm using all of
these astrological metaphors,

34:38.344 --> 34:40.686
"it's because
Officer Randall and I

34:40.786 --> 34:43.288
"are about
to watch the Leodons,

34:43.388 --> 34:45.851
"a once-in-a-generation wonder,

34:45.951 --> 34:49.054
"so...

34:49.154 --> 34:52.377
"Take it all in and remember,

34:52.477 --> 34:56.180
"you can never recreate
the memory of this night,

34:56.280 --> 34:59.343
"so, uh, don't try.

34:59.443 --> 35:01.946
"Just...enjoy the moment

35:02.046 --> 35:04.468
"'cause...

35:04.568 --> 35:06.190
you can never
get it back again."

35:06.290 --> 35:08.832
I'm sorry.
[stammers]

35:08.932 --> 35:11.715
I didn't mean that to happen.
Max and Mo, congratulations.

35:11.815 --> 35:13.817
Um, sorry.
I gotta go.

35:17.300 --> 35:20.063
[indistinct, distant chatter]

35:26.469 --> 35:28.131
- Zoey, are you okay?
- No. No, no, no.

35:28.231 --> 35:31.173
This is your night, and uh,

35:31.273 --> 35:33.135
I didn't want any attention
on me, and look what happened.

35:33.235 --> 35:35.618
- And what did happen?

35:35.718 --> 35:37.620
[solemn music]

35:37.720 --> 35:39.541
- It's gonna sound
really stupid when I say it,

35:39.641 --> 35:42.664
but...
[sighs]

35:42.764 --> 35:45.227
The whole reason that
that meteor shower

35:45.327 --> 35:48.390
meant a lot to me was
because of a memory

35:48.490 --> 35:50.392
I had of seeing it with my dad,
and--

35:50.492 --> 35:52.073
- Why didn't you say anything?

35:52.173 --> 35:54.235
- Because I'm tired
of being a burden,

35:54.335 --> 35:56.557
and...

35:56.657 --> 35:57.799
You guys are always there
for me,

35:57.899 --> 36:00.321
and I just--I don't want
our friendship

36:00.421 --> 36:01.722
to be one-sided.

36:01.822 --> 36:04.165
- Hey, Zoey, honestly,

36:04.265 --> 36:07.528
you can come to us anytime
about anything.

36:07.628 --> 36:10.891
No matter how busy
or wildly successful we get,

36:10.991 --> 36:12.372
we are here for you.

36:12.472 --> 36:14.895
- Well, unless Idris Elba
walks in,

36:14.995 --> 36:17.817
and then, you're a literal
stranger to me, okay, sweetie?

36:17.917 --> 36:19.459
- Let's go look
at the meteors now.

36:19.559 --> 36:22.021
- No, it's...

36:22.121 --> 36:24.143
It's your big night, and

36:24.243 --> 36:25.985
we missed the whole thing
anyway.

36:26.085 --> 36:28.107
- Okay, look.

36:28.207 --> 36:30.750
Maybe we can't
recreate that memory,

36:30.850 --> 36:33.032
but we can make a new one.

36:33.132 --> 36:35.594
There's still stars in the sky,
right?

36:35.694 --> 36:38.477
So let's get a group and go.

36:38.577 --> 36:39.878
- Yeah.

36:39.978 --> 36:42.481
You guys go do that.

36:42.581 --> 36:44.082
What?

36:44.182 --> 36:45.764
Oh, baby.
This is an indoor wig.

36:45.864 --> 36:47.686
We're not doing that.
Enjoy. Have fun.

36:47.786 --> 36:49.787
- Come here.

37:01.799 --> 37:04.341
- [sighs]

37:04.441 --> 37:06.864
Hey, bud.

37:06.964 --> 37:08.585
You all right?

37:08.685 --> 37:10.307
- Not really.

37:10.407 --> 37:11.948
Kaia was just using me
to get a job.

37:12.048 --> 37:14.190
- [sighs]
Oh, man.

37:14.290 --> 37:16.753
There are so many
more important people than you

37:16.853 --> 37:18.795
she could've used.

37:18.895 --> 37:21.637
- Look, man, dating's brutal.

37:21.737 --> 37:26.002
And, as shocking
as this may seem,

37:26.102 --> 37:28.724
even I don't score every time.

37:28.824 --> 37:31.086
Here's the thing, dude.
You went for it.

37:31.186 --> 37:32.928
And that's huge!

37:33.028 --> 37:36.732
And to make you feel better,

37:36.832 --> 37:38.173
I even agreed to go back

37:38.273 --> 37:42.057
to that creepy
stargazing spot again.

37:42.157 --> 37:43.818
- Just admit it--you get
the appeal now, don't you?

37:43.918 --> 37:45.620
- I bought a telescope.

37:45.720 --> 37:47.722
This morning.

37:50.324 --> 37:51.706
- I'm sure
they are the same beat--

37:51.806 --> 37:53.267
- Hey there. Hello.

37:53.367 --> 37:54.989
- Hey! Zoey's brother.

37:55.089 --> 37:57.071
What's up?
- You know it's David.

37:57.171 --> 37:59.954
So...I thought
about what you said.

38:00.054 --> 38:02.676
And you were right.
I am a dad.

38:02.776 --> 38:04.438
But you know who else is a dad?

38:04.538 --> 38:06.400
Many, many famous rock stars.

38:06.500 --> 38:08.241
Slash, Flea, Ozzy.

38:08.341 --> 38:10.644
Lenny Kravitz.
Now that's a cool dad.

38:10.744 --> 38:13.446
Look, I'm a good
keyboard player, okay?

38:13.546 --> 38:16.729
And your songs could benefit
from a fuller sound.

38:16.829 --> 38:18.491
