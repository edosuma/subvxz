01:11.205 --> 01:14.373
<i> I am out of this world.</i>

01:15.309 --> 01:17.743
<i> How else can I explain</i>
<i> how strange I feel</i>

01:17.745 --> 01:24.183
<i> on this planet</i>
<i> and in my skin?</i>

01:24.185 --> 01:30.122
<i> My body is a costume,</i>
<i> I cannot take off.</i>

01:30.758 --> 01:35.794
<i> I must have landed here</i>
<i> from Venus.</i>

04:01.342 --> 04:03.742
Hey! Kid!

04:04.812 --> 04:05.844
Excuse me!

04:06.981 --> 04:08.647
Excuse me, stalker boy.

04:08.649 --> 04:11.917
Yeah... hi, I've seen you
following me around

04:11.919 --> 04:13.685
for the past couple of days,

04:13.687 --> 04:16.355
and it's super creepy
and super weird.

04:16.357 --> 04:18.390
Could you just tell me
who the hell you are

04:18.392 --> 04:19.791
and what the hell you want?

04:23.264 --> 04:24.429
Um...

04:25.699 --> 04:27.633
You're sid Gill?

04:31.805 --> 04:33.038
Yeah.

04:36.810 --> 04:40.746
You dated my mom, right?
Kirsten Lewis?

04:45.019 --> 04:46.351
Yeah.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.389
Um...

04:50.391 --> 04:54.426
Well, you're my dad.

05:11.845 --> 05:13.779
Wait, what?

05:56.890 --> 05:58.023
How was school?

06:01.462 --> 06:02.761
I got an a in math.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.096
What was that?

06:04.732 --> 06:05.964
Nothing.

06:09.770 --> 06:12.604
The school play is next week.
All the parents will be there.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.740
-What day?
-Friday.

06:14.742 --> 06:16.875
Okay, we'll be there.

06:17.144 --> 06:18.910
I have to be at the site.

06:20.948 --> 06:22.481
Can't you find a replacement?

06:22.483 --> 06:23.849
I doubt it.

06:23.984 --> 06:25.117
There's still time.

06:25.652 --> 06:27.753
Yeah, that's not the issue.

06:27.755 --> 06:28.987
What's the issue?

06:29.623 --> 06:30.789
Well, the cement guy--

06:30.791 --> 06:32.157
I said parents.

06:34.495 --> 06:35.861
He's not my dad.

06:39.566 --> 06:40.799
Just drop it.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.920
<i> What's the matter?</i>
<i> Aren't you going to eat?</i>

07:34.922 --> 07:36.555
I made it myself.

07:38.158 --> 07:43.462
Thanks, ma, but I'm watching
my weight a bit these days.

07:43.464 --> 07:45.797
Watching your weight?
Men don't diet.

07:45.799 --> 07:46.731
<i> Why not?</i>

07:46.733 --> 07:48.200
You're a special case.

07:48.202 --> 07:51.803
Special case? What do you mean
special case?

07:51.805 --> 07:53.905
I mean, you're a special case.

07:54.808 --> 07:55.540
<i> What are you doing?</i>

07:55.542 --> 07:57.042
Too much sugar.

07:57.044 --> 07:58.894
You're ruining my cake.

07:58.895 --> 08:00.745
I spent hours making
those swirly designs.

08:00.747 --> 08:02.647
<i> Swirly designs?</i>

08:02.649 --> 08:04.216
<i> Deadly designs.</i>

08:04.218 --> 08:06.117
What do you mean
deadly designs?

08:06.119 --> 08:08.887
Do I look dead to you?

08:08.888 --> 08:11.656
Ma, papaji, can we please
stop bickering about the cake?

08:15.229 --> 08:17.496
Sweetie, forget about Daniel.

08:17.498 --> 08:20.031
Let me set you up
with a nice girl, huh?

08:21.034 --> 08:22.601
Why not a guy?

08:22.603 --> 08:26.137
Ma, how about you set me up
with a nice guy?

08:27.674 --> 08:29.908
You know how I feel
about the gay things,

08:29.910 --> 08:32.143
and you are not
a girl, okay?

08:32.145 --> 08:34.044
You want to spend your whole
life alone?

10:13.113 --> 10:14.613
Hello, Sylvia.

10:15.248 --> 10:16.815
So...

10:16.817 --> 10:18.783
The bitch
has left the building.

10:18.785 --> 10:21.653
<i> Damn, girl.</i>
<i> So, where are you?</i>

10:21.655 --> 10:23.088
I'm outside.

10:23.090 --> 10:25.056
<i> Nooo...</i>

10:25.058 --> 10:26.391
I am indeed.

10:26.393 --> 10:30.328
I think the day
is going pretty well so far,

10:30.330 --> 10:32.831
except that some guy just gave
me a really nasty look.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.834
<i> Just keep</i>
<i> the blinders on, honey. </i>

10:35.836 --> 10:39.838
<i> Put one foot after another </i>
<i> and never forget to breathe.</i>

10:40.307 --> 10:42.307
Got it. Except that
i may be having

10:42.309 --> 10:44.376
a bit of a panic attack,
but okay.

10:45.045 --> 10:46.911
<i> Just keep walking.</i>

10:48.281 --> 10:51.416
Okay... I'm walking.

10:52.119 --> 10:53.918
<i> You're fabulous.</i>

10:53.920 --> 10:55.787
I am freaking fabulous.

10:59.092 --> 11:00.325
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

11:05.298 --> 11:08.033
Look, I am still shaking.
Just a little bit though.

11:08.035 --> 11:10.135
You know, first time
out in the open, all of this,

11:10.137 --> 11:11.736
but it's good.

11:11.738 --> 11:14.239
Of course, you are.
I am so proud of you.

11:14.241 --> 11:17.142
Thank you... thanks.

11:17.144 --> 11:19.411
If everything goes
according to plan

11:19.413 --> 11:22.814
I start hormones in about
three months from now.

11:23.817 --> 11:28.887
And, oh my god,
at work today, let's just say,

11:28.889 --> 11:31.122
if looks could kill.

11:33.160 --> 11:36.027
Don't worry about it.
You've got this.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.463
Yes, I do.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.933
Oh... it's you again.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.236
Oh, shit.

12:54.141 --> 12:55.507
Well, that was easy.

12:58.879 --> 13:02.113
I found my skateboard...
It was just there.

13:04.351 --> 13:07.118
-You want to...
-Come inside?

13:08.922 --> 13:11.089
Do you have aspirin
in your backpack?

13:15.428 --> 13:19.430
So...
How did you meet my mom?

13:20.300 --> 13:22.367
We went to high school together.

13:25.539 --> 13:29.040
Why did you guys break up?

13:29.042 --> 13:31.276
That's complicated.

13:31.278 --> 13:33.077
Uh...

13:33.079 --> 13:37.048
We were friends
all through school

13:37.050 --> 13:41.820
and then eventually
we started dating.

13:41.822 --> 13:47.926
Then we began having the sex--

13:47.928 --> 13:50.195
wait.
Way too much information.

13:50.197 --> 13:51.596
-Okay.
-Thanks though.

13:55.202 --> 14:03.241
You dated my mom, so does
that make you...A lesbian?

14:03.243 --> 14:06.277
No... I'm not a lesbian.

14:08.148 --> 14:16.254
When, uh, I knew your mom
i was still a guy, sort of, ish.

14:16.256 --> 14:18.923
Now you're not a guy?

14:18.925 --> 14:21.492
Correct, I am not a guy now.

14:23.096 --> 14:24.462
Why?

14:27.400 --> 14:32.136
Because that's not how
i feel on the inside.

14:32.138 --> 14:37.542
I have never felt like
a guy on the inside, so...

14:42.983 --> 14:44.349
Are you still Indian?

14:45.318 --> 14:47.886
Um, yeah...

14:47.888 --> 14:52.257
That's...Not something
you can just...

14:52.259 --> 14:54.259
Yeah, that's all still there.

14:54.261 --> 14:56.928
All the Indian,
it's still there.

14:59.933 --> 15:03.101
Well, this was really fun,
and I'm so glad

15:03.103 --> 15:07.105
you came by unannounced,
unexpectedly.

15:08.975 --> 15:12.977
Um, I think it's best now
if you just head home

15:12.979 --> 15:15.246
and forget that
any of this ever happened,

15:15.248 --> 15:19.951
because, um,
I'm not your father, so...

15:21.588 --> 15:25.957
But you're...A transgender?

15:27.394 --> 15:28.393
Yeah.

15:30.397 --> 15:34.065
Are you, like, famous?

15:34.067 --> 15:35.199
What?

15:42.542 --> 15:46.511
My dad's transgender...
That is so cool.

15:54.421 --> 15:57.622
<i> So, how old was the boy?</i>

15:57.624 --> 15:59.490
<i> 14 years old.</i>

15:59.492 --> 16:02.460
<i> How long ago</i>
<i> did you date his mother?</i>

16:02.462 --> 16:04.262
Almost 15 years ago.

16:04.264 --> 16:06.364
All it takes is one little
sperm, right?

16:06.366 --> 16:08.499
-Just one.
-Shit.

16:08.501 --> 16:09.534
What?

16:09.536 --> 16:12.303
I'm looking at her profile page.

16:13.073 --> 16:15.707
Look, here is a photo
of her looking very pregnant

16:15.709 --> 16:20.078
and she's wearing my favorite
Cher t-shirt from high school.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.579
I've been looking
for this freaking t-shirt

16:21.581 --> 16:23.214
for 15 years now.

16:23.216 --> 16:25.483
Looks like
the shirt found you.

16:28.521 --> 16:30.521
Why don't you just
give her a call?

16:35.395 --> 16:36.778
Uh oh...

16:36.779 --> 16:38.162
I only started dating her
because I wanted to

16:38.164 --> 16:39.564
get closer to her brother,

16:39.566 --> 16:42.133
who I may have also
kinda sorta had sex with.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.136
No.

16:45.138 --> 16:46.437
I hate you.

17:07.394 --> 17:08.626
Hey...

17:08.627 --> 17:10.428
I picked them myself.

17:10.430 --> 17:12.597
Ah... I can tell.

17:19.239 --> 17:22.507
This is marinated bocconcini,

17:22.509 --> 17:26.044
grilled courgette
with truffle oil,

17:26.046 --> 17:31.616
and wild rice
with persian walnuts...

17:31.618 --> 17:34.252
And, uh, bread.

17:35.422 --> 17:37.422
Um...

17:37.424 --> 17:40.358
I thought you were
going to make Indian.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.260
I don't know how to cook
Indian food.

17:43.496 --> 17:45.797
I've actually
never even been to India.

17:45.799 --> 17:47.465
Just because
my parents are from there

17:47.467 --> 17:50.334
doesn't mean I know
how to cook the...Whatever.

17:52.305 --> 17:55.440
Well, there goes
my orange chicken theory.

17:58.111 --> 18:00.178
Why don't you just dig in?

18:00.780 --> 18:02.814
Can I have some soda?

18:02.816 --> 18:06.250
I don't have soda.

18:06.252 --> 18:09.487
There's filtered water
and carrot juice.

18:09.823 --> 18:11.255
Oh, and vodka.

18:15.261 --> 18:18.763
Are you hoping that I will
run down to the corner store

18:18.765 --> 18:22.133
and pick up some carbonated
artificial sugar water for you?

18:23.203 --> 18:24.502
Yeah, pretty much.

18:25.538 --> 18:27.138
That's not gonna happen.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.307
Look, kid,
let's just cut to chase.

18:29.309 --> 18:33.311
You are white and scrawny;
I am brown and beautiful.

18:33.313 --> 18:35.146
We don't look anything alike.

18:35.148 --> 18:36.481
There is no possible way

18:36.483 --> 18:38.516
that I could be
your biological father.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.853
Well, I snuck into
my mom's diary

18:41.855 --> 18:44.589
and she said
that you are my dad.

18:44.591 --> 18:46.457
I am going to
need better proof

18:46.459 --> 18:49.193
than just some
silly high school diary.

18:49.195 --> 18:52.497
Oh, it's not on a silly
high school diary...

18:52.499 --> 18:55.333
It's an embarrassing
grownup diary.

18:57.437 --> 18:58.536
Oh.

18:59.272 --> 19:00.338
Yeah.

19:03.409 --> 19:04.675
Okay.

19:05.178 --> 19:06.744
So your mom,
she doesn't know

19:06.746 --> 19:09.614
that you are here
with me right now, right?

19:09.616 --> 19:11.916
-She'd kill me if she knew.
-Why?

19:11.918 --> 19:14.485
Then she'd know
i snuck into her diary.

19:14.487 --> 19:17.588
Call her up right now
and tell her where you are.

19:18.458 --> 19:19.724
<i> Do it.</i>

19:19.726 --> 19:21.659
I don't want to call her now.

19:26.599 --> 19:28.566
Are you sure you're not famous?

19:28.568 --> 19:30.368
Oh, my god, this again?

19:34.541 --> 19:36.340
I'm going to get some vodka.

19:51.257 --> 19:54.225
Don't you have
homework or something?

19:54.961 --> 19:58.629
<i> It's summer,</i>
<i> there's no homework.</i>

19:58.631 --> 19:59.897
Oh, right.

20:05.638 --> 20:09.707
<i> Don't drink that soda.</i>
<i> It's so disgusting for you.</i>

20:11.377 --> 20:13.311
<i> You should drink milk.</i>

20:13.313 --> 20:16.514
Milk has hormones.
It'll give me boobs.

20:22.589 --> 20:23.654
Right.

20:34.367 --> 20:36.334
Okay, kid. Time to go.

21:38.598 --> 21:39.697
Thank you.

21:50.977 --> 21:53.411
Aren't you going to work?

21:53.413 --> 21:55.479
Yeah, why? You want a lift?

21:57.483 --> 21:58.399
<i> No.</i>

21:58.400 --> 21:59.316
Well, let me know
if you want me or Max

21:59.319 --> 22:00.551
to come get you later.

22:09.896 --> 22:11.996
Ralph, your water bottle!

22:33.386 --> 22:36.520
You're early,
I'm not even dressed yet.

22:36.522 --> 22:39.790
You want me
to come back later?

22:39.792 --> 22:41.625
No, of course not.

22:41.627 --> 22:42.693
Good.

22:45.732 --> 22:46.997
No, please come in.

22:46.999 --> 22:49.066
No, please,
just come in, it's fine.

22:59.011 --> 23:01.779
Wow... Indian.

23:05.418 --> 23:07.752
Oh...

23:07.754 --> 23:09.520
Can you bake me cookies?

23:10.656 --> 23:12.423
Chunky chocolate chip, please.

23:13.526 --> 23:15.659
Awesome.

23:41.521 --> 23:42.953
Hey, kid,
what's taking you so long?

23:42.955 --> 23:44.855
Did you fall into the toilet
or something?

23:50.496 --> 23:51.896
Oh, that's just great.

23:53.533 --> 23:55.499
Listen... I am only gonna
go over this one time

23:55.501 --> 23:57.468
so make sure
you pay close attention.

23:57.470 --> 23:58.803
Got it?

24:01.874 --> 24:05.142
This is not your enemy,
this is your friend.

24:05.144 --> 24:07.144
-Friend.
-Exactly.

24:07.146 --> 24:09.680
Like most friends, you only
want to keep her around

24:09.682 --> 24:11.615
as long as she stays sharp

24:11.617 --> 24:14.952
and keeps you looking
and feeling sharp.

24:14.954 --> 24:17.238
As soon as she goes dull,

24:17.239 --> 24:19.523
you want to get rid of her
because she just might cut you.

24:19.525 --> 24:21.826
That's how you ended up
with those nicks on your face.

24:21.828 --> 24:23.594
Do you know what a Nick is?

24:23.596 --> 24:27.598
-It's, uh, like a cut.
-Exactly.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.667
That over there is gel,
and that is foam.

24:29.669 --> 24:31.135
You should probably
use gel more often

24:31.137 --> 24:32.670
because it moisturizes.

24:32.672 --> 24:34.138
Moisturizes?

24:34.140 --> 24:36.106
Yes. And then...

24:37.543 --> 24:38.943
You do realize
you're not going to

24:38.945 --> 24:40.578
need to know
any of this stuff

24:40.580 --> 24:41.846
for another few years, right?

24:41.848 --> 24:43.080
No, I don't.

24:43.082 --> 24:44.648
Yeah.

24:44.650 --> 24:46.984
Another few years to go.

24:46.986 --> 24:48.786
-Not at all.
-Yes, at all.

24:49.622 --> 24:51.672
Whatever.

24:51.673 --> 24:53.723
Kid, I would kill to have
a face as smooth as yours.

24:53.726 --> 24:55.559
I'm not smooth...

24:56.696 --> 24:57.995
I'm rough.

25:00.933 --> 25:03.033
They call me rough Ralph,
you know.

25:04.136 --> 25:07.605
It's my nickname...
On the streets.

25:14.614 --> 25:15.980
Let's go out.

25:17.717 --> 25:19.183
<i> I'm bored.</i>

25:19.952 --> 25:21.218
<i> Can we? </i>

25:28.594 --> 25:30.127
I'm bored.

25:33.199 --> 25:35.599
You know,
it's unhealthy to stare

25:35.601 --> 25:37.201
at a computer screen
for that long.

25:37.203 --> 25:40.604
<i> It's bad for the physical </i>
<i> and psychological health. </i>

25:46.612 --> 25:48.679
<i> People and their technology.</i>

26:10.636 --> 26:12.169
I got to get something.

26:22.915 --> 26:25.015
Happy one-year anniversary.

26:33.359 --> 26:34.758
What's wrong?

26:35.161 --> 26:36.594
<i> Let's go out.</i>

26:39.198 --> 26:41.165
Let's go out!!

26:41.167 --> 26:45.069
Ralph, shut up, okay?
God!

26:45.071 --> 26:46.837
Why don't you just
go out on your own?

26:46.839 --> 26:51.075
Don't you have kids your own age
that you can hang out with?

26:51.077 --> 26:52.343
Jesus!

27:07.727 --> 27:09.059
Hey...

27:09.061 --> 27:11.095
I'm sorry.

27:12.331 --> 27:14.264
I shouldn't have
snapped at you.

27:18.037 --> 27:19.403
What do your folks
think about you

27:19.405 --> 27:21.105
hanging out with me, anyways?

27:21.107 --> 27:23.807
You know - with your lady dad?

27:25.211 --> 27:28.012
Well, I don't know.

27:28.347 --> 27:31.148
Oh god, you still haven't
told them yet, have you?

27:31.150 --> 27:32.816
Come on, you promised.

27:32.818 --> 27:35.019
Well, why don't you?

27:35.021 --> 27:36.887
Because you said you would.

27:36.889 --> 27:39.123
You're the grownup, not me.

27:39.125 --> 27:41.425
Look, kid, don't call me
a grownup, all right?

27:41.427 --> 27:44.361
I decide when I am a grownup.

27:44.363 --> 27:47.164
I already have a lot of things
on my plate now.

27:47.166 --> 27:50.267
I don't need to add
growing up to the platter.

27:50.269 --> 27:52.202
I'm going to be
transitioning, Ralph.

27:52.204 --> 27:53.837
That's huge.

27:53.839 --> 27:56.774
It's like going through
a second puberty, basically.

27:56.776 --> 28:00.244
Once those hormones kick in,
watch out.

28:02.048 --> 28:05.716
Basically, it's like you and i
are the same age.

28:06.986 --> 28:10.320
You think they'd freak out
and not let us hang out?

28:10.322 --> 28:11.755
Yeah, probably.

28:13.125 --> 28:15.926
Maybe that would be
a good thing, Ralph.

28:15.928 --> 28:18.929
I already have a life of my own.

28:18.931 --> 28:22.132
I am young and I am single,

28:22.134 --> 28:25.102
and I am wild...Ish.

28:26.839 --> 28:30.107
So then this penguin
jumps out of this helicopter.

28:30.109 --> 28:34.878
It's on fire, and he says,
"well, I guess it's Tuesday."

28:36.449 --> 28:38.415
Oh, penguins.

28:38.417 --> 28:41.385
-Because earlier in the joke...
-I tracked that.

28:41.387 --> 28:43.353
-...the reference.
-I caught it.

28:43.355 --> 28:45.355
-Awesome.
-Yeah.

28:45.357 --> 28:47.491
You can't beat
a good penguin, you know.

28:47.493 --> 28:49.493
That's what I say.

28:49.495 --> 28:52.262
They're everything
you want them to be, you know.

28:54.200 --> 28:57.468
Yeah, penguins. Pretty neat.

28:59.105 --> 29:02.473
<i> Pretty girls.</i>
<i> Just dancing.</i>

29:02.475 --> 29:04.808
Just dancing...
Being girls.

29:05.478 --> 29:09.079
Who would ever join...
A random group

29:09.081 --> 29:11.348
of people dancing in the park?

29:11.350 --> 29:13.016
I know I wouldn't.

29:13.819 --> 29:15.819
Ralph...

29:15.821 --> 29:17.788
Ralph, come back.

29:18.290 --> 29:20.057
<i> You shouldn't talk</i>
<i> to strangers, Ralph. </i>

29:21.961 --> 29:23.160
Leave them...

29:31.437 --> 29:32.970
Leave them alone.

29:37.042 --> 29:40.043
No, I'm feeling uncomfortable
right now.

29:40.813 --> 29:42.346
Ralph, this is...

29:44.283 --> 29:45.215
Hi.

29:47.253 --> 29:48.452
How is everyone?

31:01.927 --> 31:02.893
Hey.

31:03.963 --> 31:04.995
Hey.

31:06.031 --> 31:08.632
Wow. You look good.

31:09.568 --> 31:10.534
Thanks.

31:11.403 --> 31:13.470
I wasn't sure it was you.

31:13.472 --> 31:15.072
It's me.

31:15.074 --> 31:16.139
Yeah.

31:19.445 --> 31:22.112
And who's this?

31:23.949 --> 31:26.316
This is my son...

31:26.318 --> 31:27.584
Ralph.

31:30.089 --> 31:33.090
Yeah.
Your son?

31:34.226 --> 31:37.527
Yeah. I'm, uh, his father...
Mother.

31:37.529 --> 31:40.597
Well, father originally,
mother currently.

31:40.599 --> 31:43.166
We're working that part out.

31:47.539 --> 31:48.672
Yeah, well,
we should get going.

31:49.275 --> 31:50.540
Wait, sid?

31:50.542 --> 31:51.608
Yeah.

31:56.181 --> 31:57.915
It's good to see you.

32:03.122 --> 32:04.321
Yeah.

32:13.032 --> 32:13.997
<i> Who was that?</i>

32:13.999 --> 32:16.033
That was nobody.

32:16.535 --> 32:18.135
Why were you being weird?

32:18.137 --> 32:20.337
It's complicated.

32:20.339 --> 32:22.005
You have a boyfriend?

32:22.007 --> 32:24.141
That's even more complicated.

32:24.143 --> 32:25.542
Why?

32:27.146 --> 32:28.378
Just keep walking.

32:53.505 --> 32:54.972
Ralph!

32:54.974 --> 32:56.707
Where the heck have you been?

32:56.709 --> 32:59.343
At the skatepark.
I told you that already.

32:59.345 --> 33:00.510
All this time?

33:01.413 --> 33:03.180
Where did you get that?

33:03.182 --> 33:04.381
What?

33:04.383 --> 33:05.649
That sweatshirt.

33:05.651 --> 33:09.219
Oh, it belonged to
one of the skaters.

33:09.221 --> 33:11.688
What are you doing
in someone else's clothes?

33:12.725 --> 33:16.059
It didn't fit the guy anymore.

33:16.595 --> 33:19.663
Enough with the questions.
Can I go now, please?

33:21.266 --> 33:22.699
Do you have a girlfriend?

33:22.701 --> 33:27.771
What? No. Are you crazy?

33:32.745 --> 33:37.280
Thou shan't repeat
thy parents sins...

33:39.651 --> 33:42.319
And avoid creating new ones.

33:53.766 --> 33:55.632
<i> I'm just outside.</i>

34:15.821 --> 34:19.089
What are you, uh,
doing here this late?

34:19.625 --> 34:22.592
I mean, isn't your new
lady friend going to be upset

34:22.594 --> 34:24.194
that you're here
with me right now?

34:24.329 --> 34:25.728
<i> There's no lady friend.</i>

34:27.266 --> 34:29.433
There never was a lady friend.

34:32.771 --> 34:33.703
But I thought--

34:33.705 --> 34:36.273
sid, listen.

34:38.377 --> 34:40.342
<i> Sid, you mean everything.</i>

34:43.215 --> 34:45.282
<i> I've ever been</i>
<i> with anyone like you.</i>

34:51.322 --> 34:52.755
I just...

34:55.260 --> 35:00.597
I just wanted to
tell you I'm...Sorry.

35:07.840 --> 35:09.639
So...

35:09.641 --> 35:11.541
You're on hormones now?

35:11.743 --> 35:13.810
Um... not yet.

35:14.713 --> 35:18.615
I'm going to be meeting with
an endocrinologist soon, though.

35:23.722 --> 35:27.157
I go away
and look what happens.

35:27.159 --> 35:30.627
You come out as a woman
and you become a parent.

35:37.302 --> 35:39.603
Could you, just...?

35:41.607 --> 35:42.572
No.

35:47.246 --> 35:49.346
-It started acting up.
-Uh huh.

35:50.649 --> 35:52.782
You're so predictable.

35:54.486 --> 35:55.619
It's so good.

35:59.291 --> 36:01.458
Now you know
the real reason I came here.

36:01.460 --> 36:02.659
Uh huh.

36:06.532 --> 36:08.298
That and
your breakfast omelets.

36:18.844 --> 36:23.813
I have to get up really early
in the morning to get to work.

36:23.815 --> 36:25.348
Yeah, me too.

36:25.350 --> 36:27.317
I could drive you to work.

36:27.319 --> 36:29.653
No. I don't want you
to go out of your way.

36:29.655 --> 36:31.621
If we leave before rush hour

36:31.623 --> 36:33.390
it won't take
more than 20 minutes.

36:39.364 --> 36:40.630
Daniel, listen.

36:40.632 --> 36:45.669
I'm in a very
different place now.

36:45.671 --> 36:47.938
I don't want to go back.

36:47.940 --> 36:49.706
I don't want to go back?

36:52.411 --> 36:54.377
Sid, we can make this work.

36:54.379 --> 36:56.413
Make this work...

36:56.415 --> 36:57.781
What does that even mean?

37:00.419 --> 37:01.585
Our relationship.

37:02.955 --> 37:06.590
A real relationship.

37:06.592 --> 37:09.793
Our relationship never stopped
feeling real to me.

37:09.795 --> 37:10.827
I know.

37:15.901 --> 37:17.000
Come on.

37:31.750 --> 37:36.753
<i> Hi. Ma, papaji, welcome.</i>
<i> Come on in.</i>

37:39.791 --> 37:40.857
Or not.

37:44.429 --> 37:45.695
Uh...

37:46.565 --> 37:47.964
<i> Yes, I know it's a lot</i>

37:47.966 --> 37:50.267
but you see how ma just ran off
down the hallway?

37:50.269 --> 37:51.735
Do you think you could
just take a deep breath,

37:51.737 --> 37:53.536
turn around and go bring
her back, please?

37:55.741 --> 37:57.040
<i> Thank you.</i>

37:58.510 --> 37:59.876
Jan, wait!

38:02.848 --> 38:04.514
Papaji,
how are we doing over there?

38:04.516 --> 38:05.615
Awesome.

38:05.617 --> 38:07.050
All right, cool.

38:22.834 --> 38:29.673
Ma, here is your chai
and some sponge cake.

38:40.852 --> 38:43.920
Do you like how
i have fixed my place?

38:43.922 --> 38:46.690
You should
hang that over there.

38:46.692 --> 38:48.725
It will look better.

38:48.727 --> 38:51.695
Okay...

38:51.697 --> 38:53.563
You know what.
I think that's a great idea.

38:53.565 --> 38:56.032
You've always had
really good taste.

38:58.403 --> 39:00.570
Where is the golden temple
picture I gave you,

39:00.572 --> 39:02.539
and the batik?

39:02.541 --> 39:03.673
Uh...

39:03.675 --> 39:06.509
Well, I had those things
at my old place

39:06.511 --> 39:10.680
when I was still at university
and graduate school,

39:10.682 --> 39:16.553
but they don't really go with
the layout of this place.

39:16.555 --> 39:18.955
It's not very Indian.

39:19.591 --> 39:21.124
Okay, great.

39:27.766 --> 39:28.732
Got it.

39:32.404 --> 39:34.003
I was thinking that maybe
you could help me

39:34.005 --> 39:36.673
open this up
around the chest area.

39:36.675 --> 39:37.841
Show me.

39:37.843 --> 39:39.359
Right here.

39:39.360 --> 39:40.876
It's fine in the hips
and the shoulders

39:40.879 --> 39:42.946
but it's tight near the chest.

39:42.948 --> 39:45.448
It's possible, but not much.

39:45.450 --> 39:46.983
I can open this up

39:46.985 --> 39:49.152
and it would make it
a bit more loose.

39:49.154 --> 39:50.620
Let me try.

39:50.622 --> 39:52.055
<i> Thanks.</i>

39:52.924 --> 39:55.058
<i> Shopping these days, well,</i>

39:55.060 --> 39:59.896
<i> it's a bit more challenging </i>
<i> finding things in my size.</i>

40:00.465 --> 40:01.998
<i> Oh, here's another one.</i>

40:02.000 --> 40:04.567
I got this one
in a thrift shop...

40:14.045 --> 40:15.111
Ma?

40:18.717 --> 40:20.450
Ma, why are you crying?

40:22.087 --> 40:23.987
Where is my son?

40:25.490 --> 40:26.923
I want my son.

40:31.196 --> 40:33.096
Ma, don't be like that.

40:33.799 --> 40:35.532
Where is he?

40:42.040 --> 40:43.540
I'm right here...

40:45.911 --> 40:48.511
I'm still your child.

40:51.016 --> 40:52.749
It's not like I'm dead.

40:53.618 --> 40:56.219
It have been better
if you were dead.

40:58.690 --> 41:00.890
It would have been
better if you were dead!

41:05.530 --> 41:07.497
What's going on?

41:07.498 --> 41:09.465
I want my son back!
I want my son.

41:09.468 --> 41:10.867
Bring him back.

41:11.870 --> 41:15.472
<i> God, why has this</i>
<i> happened to me?</i>

41:15.874 --> 41:17.874
<i> What have I done</i>
<i> to deserve this?</i>

41:18.643 --> 41:20.143
<i> What have I done?</i>

41:20.145 --> 41:22.078
<i> What have I done?</i>

41:25.784 --> 41:28.117
By this age,
you should be married.

41:28.119 --> 41:31.221
You should have a family.
Who will pass on our name?

41:34.593 --> 41:37.660
It's funny that
you mentioned that, ma...

41:37.662 --> 41:44.501
Because...I recently
learned that...

41:48.006 --> 41:53.576
Papaji, ma...
I have a son.

42:00.185 --> 42:01.217
What?

42:02.020 --> 42:03.086
I know.

42:04.623 --> 42:05.755
Surprise!

42:07.893 --> 42:08.992
Ralph?

42:17.302 --> 42:18.968
<i> Ralph.</i>

42:20.171 --> 42:22.005
Is that a punjabi name?

42:22.607 --> 42:24.040
Uh, not so much.

42:26.144 --> 42:27.644
Ralph.

42:27.646 --> 42:29.712
What kind of nonsense
name is that?

42:31.550 --> 42:34.017
I will call you rajinder.

42:36.621 --> 42:38.888
Rajinder?

42:38.890 --> 42:42.225
Yes, I can see the resemblance.

42:42.227 --> 42:44.260
You have my high cheekbones.

42:47.299 --> 42:50.934
Sid, look, just like you.

42:52.037 --> 42:53.770
Do you do well in school?

42:54.673 --> 42:56.739
Um...

42:56.741 --> 42:57.974
I guess.

42:58.810 --> 43:00.610
You're a good boy then.

43:01.580 --> 43:03.346
Are you hungry?

43:03.348 --> 43:05.214
You want something to eat?

43:05.216 --> 43:07.617
<i> He's always hungry.</i>

43:07.619 --> 43:09.018
I'm always hungry.

43:09.788 --> 43:12.755
Guru nanak
has finally answered my prayers.

43:14.693 --> 43:15.792
Do you have orange chicken?

43:15.794 --> 43:17.226
That would be phenomenal.

43:17.762 --> 43:21.598
And guru nanak
has answered mine.

43:27.172 --> 43:28.905
Mmm, that's good.

43:29.608 --> 43:32.141
Ma, that's way too much food.

43:32.143 --> 43:34.143
You're gonna give the kid
a heart attack.

43:34.145 --> 43:36.779
Nonsense. The boy is hungry.

43:36.781 --> 43:41.017
He's skin and bones.
Look at him. Skinny.

43:41.019 --> 43:43.286
-Here, Ralph, drink this.
-Why?

43:45.090 --> 43:47.790
Because it will help him
to digest better.

43:47.792 --> 43:51.227
Digest water
is what he'll digest.

43:51.229 --> 43:53.096
No, ma.
Haven't you been reading

43:53.098 --> 43:54.998
that new parenting book?

43:55.000 --> 43:56.799
Are you calling me a fool?

43:56.801 --> 44:00.103
No. I'm just saying
I'm actually reading

44:00.105 --> 44:02.872
about how to
properly raise a kid.

44:02.874 --> 44:05.174
What? I need a book?

44:05.176 --> 44:07.110
You are the fool
reading that book.

44:41.112 --> 44:43.813
Rajinder! Come.

44:46.384 --> 44:48.084
Here...

44:48.086 --> 44:50.720
When he was your age
he had braces,

44:50.722 --> 44:52.989
and so for one year
he didn't smile,

44:52.991 --> 44:55.425
and when he ate
he looked like a fish.

44:56.428 --> 44:57.694
<i> Who's that?</i>

44:59.798 --> 45:01.264
<i> It was Halloween.</i>

45:01.266 --> 45:04.233
For days and days he shouted,

45:04.235 --> 45:07.437
"i want to be a cowgirl.
I want to be a cowgirl."

45:07.439 --> 45:09.972
<i> What a headache.</i>

45:09.974 --> 45:14.911
So finally I told him,
"okay then, be a cowgirl."

45:14.913 --> 45:18.981
So, I made him a costume
out of one my old saris.

45:20.285 --> 45:21.884
She was so happy.

45:23.188 --> 45:26.456
Ma, you just called me she.

45:27.859 --> 45:29.258
I did not.

45:29.260 --> 45:31.060
Yeah, you did.
You just said she.

45:31.062 --> 45:34.230
You said, "she looked so happy."

45:34.933 --> 45:38.301
Amran! Where did that man go?

45:43.108 --> 45:46.008
Hey, is this my mom?

45:46.010 --> 45:47.376
Let me see.

45:51.282 --> 45:54.701
Oh, my gosh.

45:54.702 --> 45:58.121
That is indeed Kirsten at my
disaster of a birthday party.

45:58.123 --> 45:59.889
I think the only
reason she came

45:59.891 --> 46:02.992
is because she
felt sorry for me.

46:02.994 --> 46:05.528
I was kind of a dork back then.

46:05.530 --> 46:06.829
Back then?

46:08.366 --> 46:10.133
Were you dating?

46:10.135 --> 46:13.069
No, that was
a few years later.

46:16.307 --> 46:18.808
I'm pretty sure
she doesn't hate you.

46:18.810 --> 46:21.377
I'm pretty sure she
would hate me

46:21.379 --> 46:23.412
if she knew
i had kidnapped her son

46:23.414 --> 46:26.082
and adopted him
into my crazy Indian family.

46:26.985 --> 46:28.351
Yeah, that would do it.

47:06.524 --> 47:09.091
There are three times

47:09.093 --> 47:10.827
when I have seen her
this happy.

47:11.429 --> 47:13.396
Today, seeing Ralph,

47:13.398 --> 47:15.932
and the day you were born.

47:19.504 --> 47:21.270
So, what was the third?

47:22.373 --> 47:24.607
The day she left her in-laws.

47:31.149 --> 47:33.149
You think
she doesn't understand you.

47:34.085 --> 47:36.586
She has been in your shoes.

47:38.623 --> 47:40.990
She always spoke her mind.

47:40.992 --> 47:43.059
She did what she wanted.

47:45.430 --> 47:47.029
Sound familiar?

48:02.947 --> 48:05.081
Thanks, ma. Good night.

48:12.090 --> 48:14.523
So, what do you think
of your grandparents?

48:14.525 --> 48:16.125
They're pretty special.

48:17.462 --> 48:20.062
Hey, I should start
exploring my Indian roots.

48:20.064 --> 48:22.398
Yeah...

48:22.400 --> 48:23.633
Seriously, I think you should.

48:26.004 --> 48:27.904
Here, wait.

48:27.906 --> 48:32.441
These are the keys to my place.

48:32.443 --> 48:37.313
In case you need a place
to hang out or something. Okay?

48:39.150 --> 48:40.249
Cool.

48:41.686 --> 48:44.120
I could call you mom
if you want.

48:44.122 --> 48:46.989
I thought you wanted a dad?

48:46.991 --> 48:48.391
I don't care.

48:48.393 --> 48:51.394
I just want someone nice
who at least knows I exist.

49:56.427 --> 49:57.760
I got it.

50:11.209 --> 50:12.408
Who are you?

50:13.111 --> 50:14.443
Tabarnak!

50:16.314 --> 50:19.482
Ralph!
Hey, Ralph.

50:19.784 --> 50:23.419
How are you?
It's great... hi!

50:23.421 --> 50:24.687
<i>You two know each other, right?</i>

50:24.689 --> 50:26.422
<i> Ralph, Daniel. Daniel, Ralph.</i>

50:26.424 --> 50:28.357
This is such a pleasant--

50:28.359 --> 50:31.761
you're here and I'm happy
to see you, Ralph.

50:32.663 --> 50:34.330
<i> Come back. Ralph!</i>

50:38.236 --> 50:40.669
Ralph. Hey!
What are you doing?

50:40.671 --> 50:42.538
I'm out here
in my underwear for you.

50:42.540 --> 50:44.206
Come on back in.

50:45.109 --> 50:46.642
Why is he in your place?

50:46.644 --> 50:49.378
Daniel and i
are back together now.

50:50.348 --> 50:52.782
He's a nice guy, you'll see.

50:52.784 --> 50:54.717
You never told me.

50:54.719 --> 50:56.619
Well, I'm telling you now!

50:56.621 --> 50:59.121
So come on back in
and you two can

50:59.123 --> 51:01.090
get to know each other better.

51:01.659 --> 51:03.325
I thought you didn't like him.

51:03.327 --> 51:05.261
Why are you
freaking out about this?

51:06.197 --> 51:08.798
You're doing like my mom.
Screw you!

51:09.700 --> 51:12.201
Ralph! Hey!

51:13.738 --> 51:15.271
Ralph, come back!

51:15.273 --> 51:19.275
You did not just give me
your middle finger, young man!

51:31.422 --> 51:32.421
Hi.

51:33.724 --> 51:35.291
Hi.

51:35.293 --> 51:37.760
Hi papaji. Um...

51:39.464 --> 51:42.832
This is Daniel.
Daniel, this is my dad.

51:42.834 --> 51:43.866
Hi, Daniel.

51:43.868 --> 51:46.102
-Hi. Nice to meet you.
-And you.

51:46.104 --> 51:48.304
-Come in.
-Thanks.

51:56.280 --> 51:59.782
Hi, ma. This is Daniel.

51:59.784 --> 52:01.717
Daniel, this is my mom.

52:05.323 --> 52:06.755
Hello, Daniel.

52:15.399 --> 52:16.799
Mmm.

52:21.172 --> 52:23.339
My son says...

52:23.341 --> 52:26.242
Oh, I'll have to get used to
calling sid my daughter.

52:27.245 --> 52:29.345
...says you have a big family.

52:29.347 --> 52:33.716
Yes, well,
i have one brother, Alex,

52:33.718 --> 52:37.720
and a large extended family.

52:38.923 --> 52:42.258
Your brother Alex -
is he also...?

52:45.429 --> 52:51.200
Alex is getting married
this summer...To a woman.

52:52.570 --> 52:54.436
A woman woman?

52:54.438 --> 52:56.472
A woman like you, yeah.

52:56.474 --> 52:59.241
How nice!

52:59.243 --> 53:05.314
Well, this situation between
both of you is a bit sensitive.

53:06.584 --> 53:11.587
<i>For one thing I am just getting</i>
<i> used to sid as a woman,</i>

53:11.589 --> 53:14.657
<i> and now seeing you both </i>
<i> as a couple.</i>

53:14.659 --> 53:16.225
<i> So confusing.</i>

53:16.894 --> 53:19.862
You see, I always imagined
sid with a woman,

53:19.864 --> 53:21.830
not as a woman.

53:21.832 --> 53:26.835
And now that sid has a son,
well, it's so modern!

53:26.837 --> 53:29.605
Blender family situation,
you know.

53:29.607 --> 53:31.657
Yes.

53:31.658 --> 53:33.708
Actually, ma, I think you
meant to say, 'blended' family.

53:33.711 --> 53:35.678
-That's what I figured.
-Okay, never mind.

53:35.680 --> 53:37.746
What do you think of rajinder?

53:39.684 --> 53:41.250
I'm sorry?

53:41.251 --> 53:42.817
She's talking about Ralph.
Just go with it.

53:43.487 --> 53:47.089
Oh, yes!

53:47.090 --> 53:50.692
Well, I don't think sid and i
see ourselves as his parents.

53:50.695 --> 53:52.761
He already has a family.

53:52.763 --> 53:56.265
Why not? He's family to me.

53:56.267 --> 53:57.900
I'm his grandmother!

53:57.902 --> 54:00.569
<i> Yes, yes, of course! </i>
<i> No, please don't get me wrong.</i>

54:00.571 --> 54:02.471
Family is
extremely important to us.

54:02.473 --> 54:03.772
As it should be.

54:03.774 --> 54:05.241
Absolutely.

54:05.243 --> 54:06.875
Uh, what I meant--

54:06.877 --> 54:09.311
oh! There he is!

54:09.313 --> 54:10.779
I'll get the door.

54:12.450 --> 54:15.417
Wait, what?
Ralph is here, now?

54:15.419 --> 54:17.920
Yes. You never bring him over,

54:17.922 --> 54:20.256
so we told him
to come on his own.

54:20.258 --> 54:22.891
Great... great.

54:28.032 --> 54:30.399
<i> Sat Sri akal.</i>

54:32.770 --> 54:35.571
<i> Ki hal hai, beta? </i>

54:53.658 --> 54:56.925
That's just so nice!

55:48.746 --> 55:50.913
-Is everything okay in here?
-Yeah.

55:53.684 --> 55:55.784
-You're sure?
-Go, it's fine.

55:56.520 --> 55:59.121
Mom! Come check this out.
Look, look, look!

56:19.810 --> 56:22.478
Ah, look who's joining
the partay!

56:24.048 --> 56:26.382
Yes, he's got moves.

56:30.454 --> 56:32.054
You got the best deal.

56:32.056 --> 56:33.155
What do you mean?

56:33.157 --> 56:35.491
You got to skip
the dirty-diaper phase,

56:35.493 --> 56:37.760
the potty training,
the temper tantrums,

56:37.762 --> 56:39.395
blah, blah, blah,

56:39.396 --> 56:41.029
and skipped straight ahead
to a pre-programmed,

56:41.031 --> 56:45.134
pre-packaged teenager.
No assembly required.

56:45.136 --> 56:47.102
No assembly.

56:47.104 --> 56:50.472
Yeah, I guess I'm the one
needing all the assembly, right?

56:50.474 --> 56:51.840
Don't we all?

56:51.842 --> 56:55.844
Speaking of, how are things
with the assemblage

56:55.846 --> 56:58.580
of Sylvia and Mira
under one roof?

56:58.582 --> 56:59.848
How is it?

57:00.918 --> 57:05.053
Well, there's laundry...
But it doesn't suck.

57:05.055 --> 57:06.588
Well, there you have it.

57:06.590 --> 57:08.957
The exciting life
of a married couple!

57:11.128 --> 57:12.194
Hey, babe.

57:14.932 --> 57:17.699
You didn't buy these things
for Ralph, did you?

57:17.701 --> 57:18.867
No.

57:21.672 --> 57:23.539
You picking him up
from the skatepark?

57:23.541 --> 57:24.673
No.

57:24.675 --> 57:26.208
Then how is he getting home?

57:27.478 --> 57:29.745
Taking the bus,
like everybody else.

57:31.081 --> 57:33.449
This stuff
is no small change, Max!

57:33.451 --> 57:35.951
It must be worth
at least 500 bucks.

57:45.062 --> 57:47.529
He said he's just trading things
with his friends.

57:52.670 --> 57:54.536
I'm gonna
keep an eye on him.

58:02.546 --> 58:03.612
This is...

58:03.614 --> 58:04.913
This is boring.

58:05.216 --> 58:07.583
This is the best cardio
you'll ever get.

58:07.585 --> 58:09.117
The heart is a muscle, you know.

58:09.119 --> 58:11.253
Yeah? Well my heart's bored.

58:11.255 --> 58:13.188
Your heart is out of shape.

58:13.190 --> 58:15.824
That's what happens when you sit
around playing video games.

58:20.264 --> 58:21.530
Breathe.

58:22.633 --> 58:24.199
What about
your parents, Ralph?

58:24.201 --> 58:26.268
Don't they want to meet us?

58:26.270 --> 58:29.872
Yeah!
My mom says she's gonna call.

58:33.844 --> 58:36.178
<i> Hey! My boys are back!</i>

58:36.180 --> 58:38.130
<i> I was running with you guys</i>

58:38.131 --> 58:40.081
<i> the whole time in spirit,</i>
<i> really, I was. </i>

58:40.084 --> 58:42.017
If he keeps it up,
he'll be able to run

58:42.019 --> 58:44.586
the half marathon
by the time he's 40.

58:44.588 --> 58:46.154
-<i> Oh, yeah?</i>
-Yeah.

58:47.691 --> 58:49.725
Oh shit,
i have to get ready.

58:49.727 --> 58:51.159
Ready for what?

58:52.796 --> 58:54.630
My brother's engagement.

58:57.201 --> 58:59.034
Engagement...

58:59.036 --> 59:02.004
I don't think you
had mentioned that before.

59:03.173 --> 59:05.591
Of course, I did.

59:05.592 --> 59:08.010
No, I mean I guess you didn't
tell me that it was today.

59:09.013 --> 59:10.045
Oh.

59:10.047 --> 59:14.883
So I guess you're not going
to be bringing a date with you?

59:17.254 --> 59:21.690
Sid, it's just
a family thing, really.

59:21.692 --> 59:24.192
Okay. Sure.

59:25.963 --> 59:27.329
Go on, get ready.

59:34.238 --> 59:36.104
Can I ask you something?

59:36.106 --> 59:38.106
Yeah, go for it.

59:41.211 --> 59:43.645
How come you guys
never go out?

59:47.851 --> 59:49.117
Eat your granola.

01:00:54.051 --> 01:00:55.117
Oh!

01:00:55.753 --> 01:00:57.252
God...

01:01:00.157 --> 01:01:03.659
I thought you...
Had already left.

01:01:03.661 --> 01:01:04.726
No.

01:01:08.132 --> 01:01:11.667
You should have at least
texted me before coming over.

01:01:11.669 --> 01:01:12.968
Yes, definitely.

01:01:19.343 --> 01:01:21.109
You're drunk.

01:01:22.846 --> 01:01:24.112
I'm not drunk.

01:01:31.155 --> 01:01:32.421
What are you doing?

01:01:32.423 --> 01:01:34.456
I just want to feel
your real hair.

01:01:34.458 --> 01:01:37.993
No, don't.
I'm still growing it out.

01:01:38.862 --> 01:01:41.096
It doesn't matter, seriously.

01:01:41.098 --> 01:01:44.232
It... it matters to me.

01:01:50.708 --> 01:01:53.075
<i> So, did you have fun</i>
<i> at the engagement party?</i>

01:01:53.077 --> 01:01:54.376
Oh, yeah.

01:01:57.081 --> 01:02:01.149
Were there a lot of women
there for you to dance with?

01:02:01.151 --> 01:02:03.018
-Yeah. Lots.
-Great.

01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:07.422
I spent the night with
aunt Marie and Sophie.

01:02:07.424 --> 01:02:10.859
Lots of beautiful aunts
and grandmothers.

01:02:12.229 --> 01:02:13.995
Right.

01:02:13.997 --> 01:02:15.363
Family, you know.

01:02:18.035 --> 01:02:23.105
Seeing my
brother getting married...

01:02:23.107 --> 01:02:26.408
<i> I thought maybe I could too,</i>
<i> you know,</i>

01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:29.111
<i> marry a woman like you.</i>

01:02:31.315 --> 01:02:34.316
And what makes you think
a woman like me

01:02:34.318 --> 01:02:38.286
would even want to marry
a man like you?

01:02:42.292 --> 01:02:44.276
<i> I don't know.</i>

01:02:44.277 --> 01:02:46.261
Would a woman like you
marry a man like me?

01:02:52.770 --> 01:02:55.904
Okay, whatever.
You're totally drunk right now.

01:03:05.048 --> 01:03:06.515
Right?

01:03:21.498 --> 01:03:24.299
You never told me
Daniel was so handsome.

01:03:25.302 --> 01:03:27.235
I can see why
you're in love with him.

01:03:27.971 --> 01:03:32.307
He's successful, smart,
he carries himself so well.

01:03:33.243 --> 01:03:35.377
I'm so happy you found someone.

01:03:37.347 --> 01:03:38.413
Oh!

01:03:40.350 --> 01:03:42.017
I bought you something.

01:03:45.088 --> 01:03:47.589
Perkyplum,
there was a 2-for-1.

01:03:49.993 --> 01:03:51.159
When is your surgery?

01:03:51.161 --> 01:03:52.928
Your father and i
want to help out.

01:03:54.598 --> 01:03:55.864
What?

01:03:57.534 --> 01:04:01.269
Why would you
want to help out with surgery?

01:04:02.439 --> 01:04:03.839
Why not?

01:04:03.841 --> 01:04:05.874
Well, because that's my...

01:04:08.478 --> 01:04:14.049
Is that the only way you would
see me as a woman woman?

01:04:16.453 --> 01:04:18.920
Is that the only way
it would be okay with you

01:04:18.922 --> 01:04:21.623
for me to be with a man?

01:04:21.625 --> 01:04:25.927
Nonsense...
I never had objections.

01:04:25.929 --> 01:04:27.896
You never
brought home anyone suitable.

01:04:27.898 --> 01:04:29.531
Every man you brought home wa--

01:04:29.533 --> 01:04:32.968
I've never brought home
a man before, ever.

01:04:32.970 --> 01:04:34.603
Because you forbade it.

01:04:35.906 --> 01:04:38.240
-I did not.
-Yes, you did.

01:04:38.242 --> 01:04:39.574
I just want you to be happy.

01:04:39.576 --> 01:04:41.977
No. You want you to be happy.

01:04:43.213 --> 01:04:45.914
And?
What's wrong with that?

01:04:45.916 --> 01:04:48.149
Don't I deserve to be happy?

01:04:48.151 --> 01:04:52.420
If you are unhappy in any way,
that's all my fault?

01:04:52.422 --> 01:04:55.390
I never said that.

01:04:56.927 --> 01:04:58.593
You sort of just did.

01:04:59.930 --> 01:05:02.097
You tell me
you want to be a woman,

01:05:02.099 --> 01:05:05.533
then you get angry
when I accept you as a woman.

01:05:05.535 --> 01:05:08.670
I only have one child;
Tell me what you want?

01:05:08.672 --> 01:05:11.339
I want you to accept me
as I am now.

01:05:11.341 --> 01:05:13.575
What are you, huh?
Tell me!

01:05:18.382 --> 01:05:20.299
You can't win on a serve.

01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:22.217
-What? What is that?
-You can't win on a serve...

01:05:22.219 --> 01:05:23.685
-...whatever.
-It's a new rule.

01:06:09.967 --> 01:06:11.667
How are you doing?

01:06:11.668 --> 01:06:13.368
-Good. Yourself?
-Good, thank you.

01:06:17.641 --> 01:06:19.274
You pickin' up your kid?

01:06:19.276 --> 01:06:22.344
Yeah. Well, my girlfriend's.

01:06:22.346 --> 01:06:23.645
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

01:06:23.647 --> 01:06:25.513
-Me, it's my stepson.
-Oh, really?

01:06:25.515 --> 01:06:27.382
-A lot of work.
-Oh, yeah.

01:06:28.685 --> 01:06:29.985
Hey, Ralph!

01:06:32.122 --> 01:06:33.254
That's mine.

01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:38.259
Don't look so happy
to see me, man?

01:06:43.633 --> 01:06:46.134
Hey, Ralph...
Get in the truck.

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:51.673
Go ahead, get in the truck.

01:06:54.311 --> 01:06:57.512
But it's not like we're really
doing anything so wrong.

01:06:57.514 --> 01:06:59.748
No, of course not.
What we're doing is a crime.

01:07:00.617 --> 01:07:04.219
Sid, wake up.
This isn't real, none of it is.

01:07:04.221 --> 01:07:05.787
We're like playing house.

01:07:05.789 --> 01:07:07.088
Daniel, calm down.

01:07:07.090 --> 01:07:08.723
Calm down? Wha...

01:07:08.725 --> 01:07:10.492
I can't believe
we got sucked into this.

01:07:10.494 --> 01:07:15.096
This kid is manipulating us,
not to mention your parents.

01:07:15.098 --> 01:07:17.132
Do they know what's going on?
I don't think so.

01:07:17.134 --> 01:07:18.333
What do you mean?

01:07:18.335 --> 01:07:19.734
You've let them get attached
to him already.

01:07:19.736 --> 01:07:22.404
What happens when
he's taken away from them?

01:07:28.078 --> 01:07:29.210
Ralph, hi.

01:07:29.713 --> 01:07:32.213
Um...

01:07:32.215 --> 01:07:34.682
I think we need to have a talk.

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:04.512
Where did you get that?

01:08:04.514 --> 01:08:05.713
Huh?

01:08:16.426 --> 01:08:17.492
Oh!

01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:20.562
All right, all right...

01:08:22.365 --> 01:08:24.198
Sid, I'm taking off now.

01:08:31.207 --> 01:08:33.541
Hey, listen, uh...

01:08:36.145 --> 01:08:37.879
Once this
wedding business is over

01:08:37.881 --> 01:08:39.581
you'll come meet
my family, okay?

01:08:42.752 --> 01:08:46.187
<i> Everyone will be more relaxed.</i>
<i> You know...</i>

01:08:51.361 --> 01:08:52.493
<i> Trust me.</i>

01:08:57.134 --> 01:08:58.633
I'll see you tonight.

01:09:02.272 --> 01:09:03.505
Okay, bye.

01:09:04.541 --> 01:09:09.611
<i> Once you have</i>
<i> hmm-mm, hmm-mm...</i>

01:09:09.613 --> 01:09:13.413
<i> Just try to make it</i>
<i> so you're thinking</i>

01:09:13.416 --> 01:09:15.783
<i> a higher-resonance sound.</i>

01:09:18.755 --> 01:09:21.689
<i> So I decided I wanted</i>
<i> to do a voice video</i>

01:09:21.691 --> 01:09:26.361
<i> to help with the</i>
<i> feminization of the voice.</i>

01:09:27.531 --> 01:09:32.332
<i> Okay, stuff you do.</i>
<i> Hmm-mm, hmm-mm,</i>

01:09:32.335 --> 01:09:36.437
<i> meow, meow, meow, meow.</i>

01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:38.939
Meow, meow...

01:09:38.942 --> 01:09:42.377
<i> And you want</i>
<i> to transition to meow -</i>

01:09:42.379 --> 01:09:47.582
<i> meow drove all day,</i>
<i> meow drove all day...</i>

01:09:47.584 --> 01:09:53.488
<i> Um, try and do that with</i>
<i> some of those sentences...</i>

01:10:06.203 --> 01:10:07.268
Hey.

01:10:08.738 --> 01:10:10.672
I'm sorry.
The party went on all night.

01:10:25.422 --> 01:10:26.854
What are you doing?

01:10:26.856 --> 01:10:28.456
Trying to win.

01:10:33.263 --> 01:10:36.731
Okay, well...
I got to go to bed.

01:10:37.667 --> 01:10:38.967
Hey, babe...

01:10:38.969 --> 01:10:41.269
Can you just give me an idea

01:10:41.271 --> 01:10:46.441
of how much longer you plan on
keeping us in the closet?

01:10:46.443 --> 01:10:49.877
Because it's getting
pretty suffocating in here,

01:10:49.879 --> 01:10:51.579
if you ask me.

01:10:52.649 --> 01:10:55.650
Can we talk about this later?
I really need to sleep.

01:10:55.652 --> 01:10:57.552
Why? It was
a pretty simple question.

01:11:04.327 --> 01:11:05.927
See, I think
that's the main difference

01:11:05.929 --> 01:11:08.730
between you and Ralph.

01:11:08.732 --> 01:11:11.666
He is not
constantly concerning himself

01:11:11.668 --> 01:11:14.335
with what other people
think of him.

01:11:14.337 --> 01:11:15.870
Maybe you should be
hanging out with him.

01:11:15.872 --> 01:11:17.372
Maybe I should.

01:11:17.374 --> 01:11:18.706
Except that, oh yes,

01:11:18.708 --> 01:11:21.276
he is no longer in our lives

01:11:21.278 --> 01:11:24.445
because you decided that
he can't ever see us again.

01:11:24.447 --> 01:11:25.880
We decided that together.

01:11:25.882 --> 01:11:28.016
You know exactly why
he couldn't stay.

01:11:28.018 --> 01:11:29.668
He's my son.

01:11:29.669 --> 01:11:31.319
<i> It wasn't about him</i>
<i> being your son;</i>

01:11:31.321 --> 01:11:34.289
<i> it was about</i>
<i>keeping his parents in the dark.</i>

01:11:34.291 --> 01:11:35.957
You would know all about

01:11:35.959 --> 01:11:38.660
keeping parents in the dark,
wouldn't you?

01:11:38.662 --> 01:11:41.362
Yeah, right. Well, this isn't
easy for me either, you know.

01:11:41.364 --> 01:11:42.697
If you wanted easy,

01:11:42.699 --> 01:11:44.565
why did you bother
coming back here?

01:11:44.567 --> 01:11:46.067
I came back
for what we were...

01:11:47.837 --> 01:11:49.771
And now I don't know
what we are.

01:12:20.937 --> 01:12:21.936
Hey.

01:12:24.574 --> 01:12:25.640
Hey.

01:12:31.581 --> 01:12:33.715
I got in a fight
with my brother.

01:12:48.598 --> 01:12:50.465
If the guys hadn't
pulled me off,

01:12:50.467 --> 01:12:51.766
I would have killed him.

01:12:54.671 --> 01:12:56.671
He called me faggot.

01:13:00.977 --> 01:13:02.543
Things got ugly, and...

01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:08.750
I think he suspects
I'm seeing you.

01:13:15.091 --> 01:13:17.392
However, my brother is an idiot.

01:13:18.762 --> 01:13:20.695
It's been like this
since we were kids.

01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:34.976
I can't do this anymore.

01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:39.147
It's too hard.

01:13:42.786 --> 01:13:45.520
It's like I'm two people
living this double life.

01:13:45.522 --> 01:13:46.554
I just...

01:13:48.725 --> 01:13:49.924
I just can't.

01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:55.196
What are you saying?

01:13:59.502 --> 01:14:01.068
I'm saying I'm sick of it.

01:14:04.507 --> 01:14:07.775
I'm saying that I can't play
this stupid game anymore.

01:14:07.777 --> 01:14:09.577
I'm done with them.

01:14:25.195 --> 01:14:29.163
If you're sick of playing
their stupid game...

01:14:29.165 --> 01:14:38.506
Then come out...
And play with me.

01:14:42.178 --> 01:14:43.678
Come out.

01:14:44.981 --> 01:14:49.250
Come out,
you and me, out.

01:14:52.489 --> 01:14:53.888
Can you do that for me?

01:14:59.629 --> 01:15:01.062
Because you know this genie,

01:15:01.064 --> 01:15:03.731
she ain't goin' back
in her bottle, so.

01:15:13.843 --> 01:15:14.976
Yes.

01:15:17.847 --> 01:15:18.880
Okay.

01:16:09.933 --> 01:16:11.198
Oh, shit.

01:16:16.773 --> 01:16:17.838
Yes?

01:16:18.975 --> 01:16:20.775
Kirsten, hi.

01:16:22.045 --> 01:16:25.279
It's me - sid.

01:16:28.051 --> 01:16:29.684
What are you doing here?

01:16:30.153 --> 01:16:31.986
Um...

01:16:31.988 --> 01:16:34.956
We really need to have a talk.

01:16:38.695 --> 01:16:40.795
This isn't a good time.

01:16:40.797 --> 01:16:46.267
I realize that, and I'm sorry,
but this is important.

01:16:46.269 --> 01:16:47.668
Just go.

01:17:20.803 --> 01:17:23.871
Hey, kid, it's me.

01:17:23.873 --> 01:17:26.407
As I'm sure
you know by now,

01:17:26.409 --> 01:17:32.013
my little visit to your mom
didn't go very well.

01:17:33.316 --> 01:17:35.082
But I just want you
to know that

01:17:35.084 --> 01:17:37.051
I'm going to figure it all out.

01:17:37.053 --> 01:17:43.290
And, uh, I just wanted to check
in and say, "what's up?"

01:17:43.292 --> 01:17:45.660
I hope you're doing good,

01:17:45.662 --> 01:17:48.162
and I'll talk to you soon.

01:17:48.164 --> 01:17:50.297
Okay, bye.

01:19:54.357 --> 01:19:55.556
Baby girl.

01:19:57.493 --> 01:19:59.894
It just gets easier from here.

01:20:28.191 --> 01:20:29.323
Hello?

01:21:01.624 --> 01:21:03.190
Uh uh...

01:21:15.238 --> 01:21:16.403
Ah...

01:22:36.352 --> 01:22:37.651
What are you doing here?

01:22:41.123 --> 01:22:42.489
Where is sid?

01:22:46.095 --> 01:22:48.362
Do your parents know
you're here, Ralph?

01:22:50.733 --> 01:22:52.366
All right, screw this.
I'm calling your mom.

01:22:52.368 --> 01:22:54.401
No, no, no!

01:22:55.104 --> 01:22:56.971
<i> This isn't a game, you know.</i>

01:22:57.206 --> 01:22:58.505
<i> How long do you plan to keep</i>

01:22:58.507 --> 01:23:00.140
lying to your parents
like that?

01:23:05.047 --> 01:23:07.414
Wow, Daniel,
that was delicious.

01:23:07.416 --> 01:23:09.283
Hearing those words
coming out of your mouth.

01:23:09.285 --> 01:23:10.718
It was special.

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:14.755
Sid. I'm so sorry
about what happened.

01:23:14.757 --> 01:23:17.124
I was totally caught off guard,

01:23:17.126 --> 01:23:20.561
and, you know, this won't
happen again, I promise you.

01:23:20.563 --> 01:23:22.496
You're right. It's not
going to happen again

01:23:22.498 --> 01:23:25.366
because we're done.

01:23:25.367 --> 01:23:28.235
Sid, wait...
I just told them everything.

01:23:28.237 --> 01:23:30.170
I told them about us!

01:23:30.172 --> 01:23:33.273
That's so great.
I'm really happy for you.

01:23:33.275 --> 01:23:35.342
Now get the fuck
out of my house.

01:23:49.792 --> 01:23:53.160
Max, Ralph is not in his room.
I think he ran away.

01:23:53.162 --> 01:23:54.061
<i> What?</i>

01:23:54.063 --> 01:23:55.429
Yeah...

01:23:55.431 --> 01:23:57.631
He left his phone
so I might know where he is.

01:23:58.667 --> 01:23:59.600
<i> Come on.</i>

01:23:59.602 --> 01:24:01.101
Where are you going?

01:24:01.103 --> 01:24:02.770
<i> I'll explain in the car.</i>
<i> Come on.</i>

01:24:11.781 --> 01:24:14.581
Go home, Ralph.
You shouldn't be here.

01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:17.751
Go home?

01:24:22.425 --> 01:24:24.324
I don't want
to live with them.

01:24:24.326 --> 01:24:26.627
I want to live with you.

01:24:29.498 --> 01:24:32.266
Ralph, you need
to realize something...

01:24:33.436 --> 01:24:35.302
I think maybe
you should have never

01:24:35.304 --> 01:24:37.371
come looking for me
in the first place.

01:24:39.108 --> 01:24:44.178
I think maybe your real dad...
Doesn't know anything

01:24:44.180 --> 01:24:46.346
about how to be a good parent.

01:24:48.517 --> 01:24:51.585
You already have
two parents in your life,

01:24:51.587 --> 01:24:53.620
and despite what you think,

01:24:53.622 --> 01:24:56.156
they seem to be doing
a pretty good job with you,

01:24:56.158 --> 01:24:58.225
including your stepdad.

01:24:59.495 --> 01:25:04.331
Go home to them
and leave me alone. Okay?

01:25:12.208 --> 01:25:13.540
-Wait here.
-Why?

01:25:13.542 --> 01:25:15.142
Max, please.

01:25:16.112 --> 01:25:17.444
Fine.

01:25:28.524 --> 01:25:30.290
We could take care
of each other.

01:25:36.532 --> 01:25:42.236
You can teach me about...
Dance and design, and stuff.

01:25:45.641 --> 01:25:47.241
I'm serious.

01:25:51.914 --> 01:25:53.914
I... I don't want to lose you.

01:25:55.317 --> 01:25:57.184
Because that would suck.

01:26:16.939 --> 01:26:19.339
Oh, my god,
what are you wearing?

01:26:25.548 --> 01:26:26.680
<i> Ralph.</i>

01:26:27.483 --> 01:26:28.883
What are you doing here?

01:26:28.884 --> 01:26:30.284
I told you
you're not to come here!

01:26:31.687 --> 01:26:34.221
Huh? Answer me!

01:26:36.225 --> 01:26:37.758
What the hell
are you doing with my boy?

01:26:38.627 --> 01:26:40.427
Ralph, get your stuff,
we're going home.

01:26:40.429 --> 01:26:41.495
No.

01:26:42.231 --> 01:26:44.198
This isn't up for negotiation.

01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:45.566
I'm not leaving.

01:26:45.568 --> 01:26:48.435
Let's just go home
and I'll explain everything.

01:26:48.437 --> 01:26:49.803
I'm not going home!

01:27:07.289 --> 01:27:09.223
I'm sorry...

01:27:09.225 --> 01:27:11.992
I know I should have
told you the truth.

01:27:13.362 --> 01:27:15.629
But you were too young
to understand.

01:27:16.298 --> 01:27:17.998
I really did try to
look for him, honey.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.668
Bullshit...
You didn't try at all.

01:27:22.972 --> 01:27:23.937
Ralph--

01:27:23.939 --> 01:27:25.005
no.

01:27:26.742 --> 01:27:27.708
Ohh!!

01:27:29.545 --> 01:27:31.912
Look, kid, I think you
should listen to your mom.

01:27:31.914 --> 01:27:33.847
She's scaring me
a little bit right now.

01:27:45.494 --> 01:27:49.630
When I was pregnant
with you, Ralph,

01:27:49.632 --> 01:27:54.268
I found out that your dad...

01:27:54.270 --> 01:27:56.503
Didn't feel the way
i felt about him.

01:27:57.973 --> 01:28:01.008
He wanted to be
with someone else.

01:28:04.747 --> 01:28:06.480
I was angry...

01:28:08.784 --> 01:28:10.651
I was hurt.

01:28:13.022 --> 01:28:14.921
So, I pushed him away.

01:28:23.799 --> 01:28:25.932
Kirsten, I'm....

01:28:29.538 --> 01:28:32.572
I'm sorry things happened
the way that they did.

01:28:38.647 --> 01:28:41.081
<i> Ralph, your mom and I...</i>

01:28:44.453 --> 01:28:46.720
We didn't know
what we were doing.

01:28:46.722 --> 01:28:49.990
We were just kids, you know?

01:28:58.367 --> 01:29:00.834
<i> Are...Those your mom's?</i>

01:29:00.836 --> 01:29:05.639
<i> Yes, they are indeed</i>
<i> her homemade samosas.</i>

01:29:07.376 --> 01:29:08.942
<i> -Would you like one?</i>
<i> -Yes, I would.</i>

01:29:08.944 --> 01:29:10.744
Just like old times.

01:29:16.051 --> 01:29:17.818
Oh, my god!

01:29:19.922 --> 01:29:21.922
This is how you lured my boy.

01:29:22.591 --> 01:29:23.824
It helped.

01:29:25.928 --> 01:29:27.561
How are your parents?

01:29:28.530 --> 01:29:29.896
They're hanging in there.

01:29:34.470 --> 01:29:35.836
<i> So, um...</i>

01:29:38.107 --> 01:29:41.875
Some of the things
that I did back then

01:29:41.877 --> 01:29:44.044
when you and I were...

01:29:46.782 --> 01:29:53.053
It's mainly because
i was still figuring myself out.

01:29:53.055 --> 01:29:54.654
I know.

01:29:55.791 --> 01:29:57.124
Okay.

01:30:04.066 --> 01:30:05.399
Whoa, whoa, wait.

01:30:16.111 --> 01:30:17.177
Come on.

01:30:19.114 --> 01:30:20.914
-We'll talk soon.
-Okay.

01:31:01.523 --> 01:31:03.623
My rajinder! Come.

01:31:17.506 --> 01:31:18.805
Ma?

01:31:22.010 --> 01:31:23.810
Ma!
