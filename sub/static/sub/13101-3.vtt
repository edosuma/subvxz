WEBVTT

00:05.833 --> 00:08.458
- Delenn, I need a favor.
- You have only to ask.

00:08.542 --> 00:09.958
I need to borrow
one of the White Star ships.

00:10.042 --> 00:11.250
I heard what you have in mind.

00:11.333 --> 00:13.125
I'll get it back to you
before the deadline.

00:13.208 --> 00:15.750
We can spare the ship,
but may I ask why?

00:15.833 --> 00:17.208
Listen, if you're gonna
attack Z'Ha'Dum

00:17.292 --> 00:19.250
you're gonna need
all the help you can get.

00:19.333 --> 00:20.750
There may still be
some First Ones out there

00:20.833 --> 00:22.250
that we haven't found yet.

00:22.333 --> 00:24.042
I have all the information
at hand that I need

00:24.125 --> 00:25.625
to go out looking for them.

00:25.708 --> 00:27.750
And some of them might be at
least as strong as the Shadows.

00:27.833 --> 00:29.625
We found one last time we tried.

00:29.708 --> 00:31.625
I think if we get a few more
to sign on--

00:31.708 --> 00:33.250
I agree.

00:33.333 --> 00:36.250
You'll need a translator.
The crews only speak Minbari.

00:36.333 --> 00:37.583
Lennier must stay with me, but--

00:37.667 --> 00:38.792
That's not necessary.

00:38.875 --> 00:41.042
I've been
teaching myself Minbari.

00:41.125 --> 00:42.583
I figure, what the heck,
you know

00:42.667 --> 00:44.000
it gave me something to do.

00:44.083 --> 00:45.458
I can handle the crew.

00:45.542 --> 00:47.500
Oh, it's such
a very difficult language.

00:47.583 --> 00:50.458
I know, but, uh, it's okay.

00:51.958 --> 00:55.083
[speaking in foreign language]

01:01.708 --> 01:03.625
Ah...it's--

01:03.708 --> 01:05.125
Very good!

01:05.208 --> 01:07.167
A bit of an accent..

01:07.250 --> 01:09.375
...but, yes, very good.

01:09.458 --> 01:12.958
Yes, but, um,
in the heat of battle

01:13.042 --> 01:15.083
you must do more
than speak Minbari.

01:15.167 --> 01:17.083
You must be able to think
in our language.

01:17.167 --> 01:19.792
It can take a few seconds
to translate an order.

01:19.875 --> 01:21.500
We know what can happen
in a few seconds.

01:21.583 --> 01:23.417
Boom, crash, burn.

01:23.500 --> 01:26.958
Exactly, so, uh, Marcus will
go with you, just to help--

01:27.042 --> 01:28.667
- Uh, that's really not--
- Do you mind?

01:28.750 --> 01:30.250
Not at all, love to.

01:31.667 --> 01:33.083
[sighs]

01:33.167 --> 01:35.833
Alright, then. Meet me in
docking bay four in two hours.

01:35.917 --> 01:38.958
If you're not packed and ready
to go, I'm going without you.

01:39.042 --> 01:40.500
I'll be there!

01:42.458 --> 01:43.667
Tell the crew

01:43.750 --> 01:47.042
anyone who laughs
will answer to me personally.

01:50.167 --> 01:52.625
[dramatic music]

01:57.750 --> 01:59.208
[indistinct chattering]

01:59.292 --> 02:02.500
- 'Looks like there's a party.'
- That's curious.

02:02.583 --> 02:05.250
There was no announcement
on the emperor's schedule.

02:09.625 --> 02:11.250
[all laughing]

02:11.333 --> 02:12.875
- Come, Narn.
- Oh.

02:12.958 --> 02:14.708
- Come
- Whoa.

02:14.792 --> 02:17.208
You must be terribly thirsty.

02:17.292 --> 02:19.667
You haven't had a drink
in three days.

02:21.292 --> 02:22.792
Here it is.

02:27.500 --> 02:29.667
All you have to do
is ask for it

02:29.750 --> 02:33.250
politely, of course,
and it's yours.

02:43.958 --> 02:45.250
(male #1)
'Oh!'

02:45.333 --> 02:48.083
[laughing]

02:50.542 --> 02:53.542
[laughing]

02:59.125 --> 03:00.917
He slipped on his pride

03:01.000 --> 03:02.917
and fell on his honor!

03:03.000 --> 03:04.917
[laughing]

03:06.333 --> 03:07.667
G'Kar.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.625
[instrumental music]

03:14.708 --> 03:18.542
- It was the year of fire.
- The year of destruction.

03:18.625 --> 03:21.250
(G'Kar)
The year we took back
what was ours.

03:21.333 --> 03:25.500
- It was the year of rebirth.
- The year of great sadness.

03:25.583 --> 03:28.667
- The year of pain.
- And a year of joy.

03:28.750 --> 03:32.542
- It was a new age.
- It was the end of history.

03:32.625 --> 03:35.667
(Ivanova)
It was the year
everything changed.

03:38.042 --> 03:40.708
(Garibaldi)
The year is 2261.

03:40.792 --> 03:43.792
The place, Babylon 5.

03:43.875 --> 03:46.333
[theme music]

04:13.958 --> 04:16.458
[music continues]

04:40.917 --> 04:42.958
[instrumental music]

04:46.375 --> 04:47.917
(Delenn)
By the human calendar

04:48.000 --> 04:52.167
this is January 17th, 2261.

04:52.250 --> 04:55.083
Everyone I hold dear is gone.

04:56.458 --> 04:58.083
It is over two standard weeks

04:58.167 --> 05:01.000
since John failed to return
from Z'Ha'Dum

05:01.083 --> 05:04.583
two weeks since
Mr. Garibaldi disappeared.

05:04.667 --> 05:07.208
Londo and Vir have returned
to Centauri Prime

05:07.292 --> 05:11.000
and G'Kar is also gone
searching for Mr. Garibaldi.

05:12.750 --> 05:15.875
Marcus and Ivanova have taken
one of the White Star fleet.

05:15.958 --> 05:18.833
Where they are, I have no idea.

05:18.917 --> 05:20.833
They hope to find
more of the First Ones

05:20.917 --> 05:24.250
for our final assault
on Z'Ha'Dum.

05:24.333 --> 05:26.458
It is a desperate mission

05:26.542 --> 05:29.583
but these are desperate times.

05:29.667 --> 05:31.042
Anything, anything at all?

05:31.125 --> 05:33.417
We've scanned
all the planets in the area.

05:33.500 --> 05:34.833
There may have been
something here once

05:34.917 --> 05:37.583
a long time ago,
but it's gone now.

05:37.667 --> 05:40.750
That's three dead ends in a row.

05:40.833 --> 05:43.958
Susan, apart from
our little run in last year

05:44.042 --> 05:46.083
there hasn't been a confirmed
sighting of the First Ones

05:46.167 --> 05:47.542
for almost a thousand years.

05:47.625 --> 05:49.500
- It's gonna take time.
- We don't have time.

05:49.583 --> 05:52.083
Then I suggest we move on.
We spent almost two days here.

05:52.167 --> 05:55.750
We can't afford
to waste another day.

05:55.833 --> 05:58.750
I-I just thought
from all the stories

05:58.833 --> 05:59.917
that this place would be perfect

06:00.000 --> 06:02.125
and I was sure
we'd find something.

06:03.375 --> 06:06.792
Alright.
What's next on the list?

06:06.875 --> 06:09.667
Sector 87 by 20 by 42.

06:09.750 --> 06:11.125
At least a dozen ships
have reported

06:11.208 --> 06:14.083
seeing something
rather godlike in the area.

06:14.167 --> 06:16.167
And since
neither you nor I were there

06:16.250 --> 06:18.208
it must be
one of the First Ones.

06:19.458 --> 06:21.333
You're having delusions
of grandeur again.

06:21.417 --> 06:22.792
Well, if you're gonna
have delusions

06:22.875 --> 06:26.042
may as well go
for the really satisfying ones.

06:26.125 --> 06:27.667
Shall I set course?

06:30.458 --> 06:34.125
(Delenn)
I hope they have had luck
in their journey..

06:34.208 --> 06:37.667
...because we are badly
outnumbered by our enemies.

06:40.917 --> 06:42.375
Ambassador.

06:42.458 --> 06:43.875
I've got
the information G'Kar wanted

06:43.958 --> 06:46.583
on the transport
that found Garibaldi's fighter.

06:46.667 --> 06:48.792
I tried sending word,
but I couldn't reach him.

06:48.875 --> 06:50.875
Nobody's heard from G'Kar
in days.

06:50.958 --> 06:52.292
Can it wait until he calls in?

06:52.375 --> 06:53.792
No, too risky.

06:53.875 --> 06:55.792
If this really is a lead
on Mr. Garibaldi

06:55.875 --> 06:57.208
and we wait too long

06:57.292 --> 06:59.500
we could lose
our only chance of finding him.

06:59.583 --> 07:00.917
Now, I can chase this down

07:01.000 --> 07:02.667
but if you'd rather send
someone after G'Kar--

07:02.750 --> 07:05.542
No, we can't afford to send
anymore people after him.

07:05.625 --> 07:08.792
The deadline for our attack
is too close.

07:08.875 --> 07:11.583
I can only hope he's alright.

07:11.667 --> 07:12.917
Yeah.

07:17.833 --> 07:19.875
[birds chirping]

07:27.250 --> 07:29.750
I-I-I can't believe it!
Did you see him?

07:29.833 --> 07:31.625
I was right there, Vir.
I saw him.

07:31.708 --> 07:34.792
How can you see G'Kar like that
and feel nothing?

07:34.875 --> 07:36.625
I feel, Vir.

07:36.708 --> 07:39.417
I wish that I didn't.
It would make this much easier.

07:39.500 --> 07:42.250
But we must play along
until the time is right.

07:42.333 --> 07:44.750
I don't know
if G'Kar can survive that long!

07:44.833 --> 07:46.708
He will survive, he must

07:46.792 --> 07:49.208
for my sake as well as his own.

07:49.292 --> 07:52.833
If we succeed, we will take back
our world from Cartagia

07:52.917 --> 07:55.292
and G'Kar will win back his,
as well.

07:55.375 --> 07:57.208
That was our deal.

07:57.292 --> 07:59.458
But I hear
that they're torturing him.

07:59.542 --> 08:01.875
Apparently,
Cartagia was dissatisfied

08:01.958 --> 08:03.667
with his performance
this morning.

08:03.750 --> 08:06.875
- As I told you, a monster.
- I know, I know.

08:06.958 --> 08:09.500
It's just that I've never been
involved in a conspi..

08:11.417 --> 08:13.250
I've never been involved
in a conspiracy

08:13.333 --> 08:14.875
to kill anyone before

08:14.958 --> 08:16.958
not to mention, the emperor!

08:17.042 --> 08:19.167
I thought we were past this
centuries ago!

08:19.250 --> 08:21.042
I mean, there's got to be
another way, Londo.

08:21.125 --> 08:23.000
I mean, can't we reason with him
or something--

08:23.083 --> 08:25.458
- Shh!
- 'Damn!'

08:25.542 --> 08:27.250
Damn him, damn him, damn him!

08:27.333 --> 08:30.250
Damn his silence!

08:30.333 --> 08:32.792
Ha, he refuses to bow,
he refuses to drink!

08:32.875 --> 08:33.917
Majesty.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.167
Do you know
that we assigned him

08:35.250 --> 08:36.958
one of our best
pain technicians?

08:37.042 --> 08:38.792
Pain technicians, they used
to be called torturers.

08:38.875 --> 08:41.750
Ever since they got organized,
it's pain technicians.

08:41.833 --> 08:43.542
- Why are you here?
- Uh, I--

08:43.625 --> 08:45.625
One of our very best torturers!

08:45.708 --> 08:47.292
I felt certain
he would break him.

08:47.375 --> 08:49.708
Two hours he worked,
not a sound.

08:49.792 --> 08:51.625
I said, give me a cry, Rintinzi

08:51.708 --> 08:54.583
give me a shout,
a whimper, a scream.

08:54.667 --> 08:57.083
Silence,
so I got into it myself.

08:57.167 --> 08:59.042
You can't leave these things
to others.

08:59.125 --> 09:01.583
They never get it right! It..

09:01.667 --> 09:04.875
Well, you can see for yourself.

09:04.958 --> 09:08.167
If I didn't know better,
I'd say he was a mute!

09:08.250 --> 09:10.167
Silence. Hm.

09:10.250 --> 09:11.375
I'm beginning to understand

09:11.458 --> 09:12.792
what you're going through with
this G'Kar.

09:12.875 --> 09:15.208
How you've put up with him
this long, I've no idea.

09:15.292 --> 09:18.125
He was a small burden.

09:18.208 --> 09:21.250
So towards the end I decided..

09:21.333 --> 09:22.792
...cut off his hands

09:22.875 --> 09:25.417
maybe that would get a reaction.

09:25.500 --> 09:27.958
- Great Maker. Did you--
- 'No, no.'

09:28.042 --> 09:31.042
Unfortunately, he passed out
before we got that far.

09:31.125 --> 09:32.917
Loss of blood, I suppose.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Very inconvenient.

09:35.083 --> 09:36.375
We'll start again
when he's conscious.

09:36.458 --> 09:39.292
And this time
if he remains silent..

09:39.375 --> 09:41.458
Silence! Silence! Well, well..

09:41.542 --> 09:44.500
Well, where is the joy
in that, really?

09:44.583 --> 09:46.000
He's so insubordinate.

09:46.083 --> 09:48.625
I can't have him challenging
my authority that way.

09:48.708 --> 09:51.625
I know I made a present of him
to you, Mollari

09:51.708 --> 09:53.875
but if I don't get my scream

09:53.958 --> 09:55.667
he'll have to be killed.

09:55.750 --> 09:56.958
You do understand, don't you?

09:57.042 --> 09:58.792
Oh, yes, Majesty, of course.

09:58.875 --> 10:00.125
Ah.

10:02.667 --> 10:03.792
Ah..

10:05.583 --> 10:07.833
It'll help the flowers, hm?

10:07.917 --> 10:11.958
Life and death
in perfect balance.

10:12.042 --> 10:14.792
- Good day, Mollari.
- 'Good day.'

10:21.000 --> 10:23.708
Londo, remember
what I said before

10:23.792 --> 10:26.917
about there must be another way?

10:27.000 --> 10:28.500
I was wrong.

10:30.667 --> 10:31.833
Kill him.

10:41.375 --> 10:45.333
(Zack on radio)
'Convoy one to C-and-C,
standing by.'

10:45.417 --> 10:48.667
Clear to proceed, Mr. Allan.
Good hunting to you.

10:54.792 --> 10:57.708
Now, hold your fire
until I give the word.

10:57.792 --> 10:59.583
Mr. Garibaldi
really is on board.

10:59.667 --> 11:01.625
We don't wanna risk
injuring him.

11:01.708 --> 11:04.750
It'd just make him mad,
and you know what he's like.

11:04.833 --> 11:07.083
(man on radio)
'That's a roger, Shuttle One.'

11:15.333 --> 11:18.250
- 'Yes?'
- Lyta, it's Delenn.

11:18.333 --> 11:21.000
- May I talk to you?
- 'Oh, uh..'

11:21.083 --> 11:24.042
(Lyta)
'T-this isn't a good time.
Could you come back later?'

11:24.125 --> 11:26.917
I'm afraid not.
Please, may I come in?

11:29.333 --> 11:31.000
I know it's late, but..

11:32.458 --> 11:33.833
[door closes]

11:33.917 --> 11:37.042
Lyta...what happened?

11:38.500 --> 11:39.708
Your furniture?

11:39.792 --> 11:41.083
The new ambassador instructed me

11:41.167 --> 11:43.375
to get rid of everything
but the mattress.

11:43.458 --> 11:46.958
And that was only a concession
to the human need for sleep.

11:47.042 --> 11:49.667
He said it was a distraction
from the work.

11:51.208 --> 11:55.542
But he cannot force you
to live like this, can he?

11:57.917 --> 12:00.375
Yes, he can.

12:00.458 --> 12:04.208
Was there something
that you wanted, ambassador?

12:04.292 --> 12:05.375
In less than a week

12:05.458 --> 12:07.292
the Rangers
and a few of the League worlds

12:07.375 --> 12:09.292
will launch an attack
on Z'Ha'Dum.

12:09.375 --> 12:11.083
I've sent word
to the Vorlon ambassador

12:11.167 --> 12:14.458
asking if his government would
commit ships to our cause.

12:14.542 --> 12:16.458
He has never replied.

12:16.542 --> 12:19.667
The ambassador
has been very busy.

12:19.750 --> 12:21.083
I thought
he would welcome the chance

12:21.167 --> 12:23.208
to strike at the Shadows.

12:23.292 --> 12:25.875
I think the Vorlons
have plans of their own.

12:27.625 --> 12:30.250
There's, there's
something going on..

12:31.667 --> 12:33.542
...something they
haven't told us yet.

12:36.083 --> 12:39.125
- Do you have any idea?
- No.

12:39.208 --> 12:41.875
And frankly, I'm afraid to ask.

12:43.208 --> 12:44.542
I don't think
that they care about

12:44.625 --> 12:47.042
what happens to us anymore,
Delenn.

12:47.125 --> 12:49.458
I think the game
just got bigger than that.

12:49.542 --> 12:51.417
I know this is hard for you

12:51.500 --> 12:54.625
but you must try and find out
what they're planning.

12:54.708 --> 12:56.042
I can't!

12:56.125 --> 12:58.833
You do not know what
this new Vorlon is like, Delenn

12:58.917 --> 13:00.958
or the things he can do.

13:01.042 --> 13:04.250
Lyta, in less than
seven standard days

13:04.333 --> 13:06.333
our ships are leaving
for Z'Ha'Dum.

13:06.417 --> 13:08.333
We cannot
walk into this blindly.

13:08.417 --> 13:12.333
If there's something going on,
we need to know what it is.

13:12.417 --> 13:13.500
Please!

13:17.125 --> 13:18.542
I'll do what I can.

13:20.125 --> 13:23.083
That's all I ask.
Thank you.

13:25.292 --> 13:26.833
[door opens]

13:29.208 --> 13:32.333
(Zack)
'I repeat, you are ordered
to surrender your vessel'

13:32.417 --> 13:35.500
or we will be forced to attack.

13:35.583 --> 13:38.750
This is your last warning.
Please respond.

13:38.833 --> 13:40.958
[radio static]

13:43.833 --> 13:45.458
Alright.

13:45.542 --> 13:49.542
Bravo One and Three, target main
engines and control systems

13:49.625 --> 13:50.917
but stay clear of the hull.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.750
(man on radio)
'Roger that, Shuttle One.'

13:52.833 --> 13:55.417
[gunfire]

13:57.750 --> 13:59.958
[explosion]

14:00.042 --> 14:02.292
System is still operational.

14:02.375 --> 14:03.958
Come around
for another pass at..

14:04.042 --> 14:05.667
Wait a second. Stand by.

14:09.667 --> 14:12.083
They've launched a life pod.

14:12.167 --> 14:14.167
It could be him.

14:14.250 --> 14:16.917
They'll probably try to make
a run for it. Stand by to..

14:17.000 --> 14:19.167
[explosion]

14:23.625 --> 14:25.375
Shuttle One to Bravo convoy.

14:27.167 --> 14:28.958
Any sign of survivors?

14:29.042 --> 14:31.125
(man on radio)
'Negative, Shuttle One.'

14:31.208 --> 14:33.167
[sighs]
I don't get it.

14:33.250 --> 14:35.625
We didn't do that much damage.

14:35.708 --> 14:39.458
(man on radio)
'We could've hit
a primary system somehow.'

14:39.542 --> 14:40.792
Maybe.

14:43.125 --> 14:46.167
Alright. Let's pick up
the life pod.

14:47.542 --> 14:49.500
I only hope
they decided to surrender

14:49.583 --> 14:51.875
before they knew
how badly they were hit.

14:51.958 --> 14:53.875
(man on radio)
'Roger. Moving in.'

15:22.125 --> 15:24.208
(automated message)
'Contact confirmed.'

15:24.292 --> 15:26.250
'Initiating program.'

15:32.083 --> 15:34.375
[dramatic music]

15:37.542 --> 15:39.250
(male #2)
'Alright, watch it.'

15:39.333 --> 15:41.583
I want full body and cardiac
stimulation, alright?

15:41.667 --> 15:43.167
Oxygenate his blood!

15:43.250 --> 15:44.500
Run bioplasma up the carotid

15:44.583 --> 15:46.292
to minimize injury
to the brain cells.

15:46.375 --> 15:48.000
Doc, will he be okay?

15:48.083 --> 15:50.125
I'm not sure until we do
a full scan, but I think so.

15:50.208 --> 15:53.000
He should be okay as long as
we don't find any surprises.

15:53.083 --> 15:54.625
Now, what happened?
How'd you find him?

15:54.708 --> 15:56.333
We had a lead on the guy
who found his fighter

15:56.417 --> 15:58.333
and turned it over
to a salvage operation.

15:58.417 --> 16:00.500
When we ran a check
on Earth-registered ships

16:00.583 --> 16:02.750
we came up lucky,
got his flight plan.

16:02.833 --> 16:03.958
You know
what they were doing to him?

16:04.042 --> 16:04.958
Negative.

16:05.042 --> 16:06.125
Ship was destroyed right after

16:06.208 --> 16:07.542
they ejected his life pod.

16:07.625 --> 16:09.708
Doctor, there's a rise
in blood pressure.

16:09.792 --> 16:11.042
Alright, I'm coming in.

16:11.125 --> 16:12.542
Good going on this,
Zack, alright?

16:12.625 --> 16:14.250
It's about time we had
a little luck around here.

16:14.333 --> 16:15.542
Thanks.

16:19.792 --> 16:22.917
Yeah. We were lucky, alright.

16:25.375 --> 16:28.292
[indistinct chattering]

16:41.417 --> 16:44.333
[dramatic music]

16:58.917 --> 17:00.833
You didn't have
to pull out of me so fast.

17:00.917 --> 17:02.375
You hurt me.

17:04.917 --> 17:08.375
While I was carrying you,
you felt..

17:08.458 --> 17:10.542
...cold, hard.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.667
What are you hiding from me?

17:14.750 --> 17:17.542
Your work for now
is done here.

17:18.500 --> 17:20.833
Go. Sleep.

17:22.542 --> 17:25.458
I have a right to know.

17:25.542 --> 17:28.083
I have done
everything you asked.

17:28.167 --> 17:30.958
I let your people modify me

17:31.042 --> 17:32.542
enhance my telepathic ability

17:32.625 --> 17:35.875
so I'd be more suited to carry
a Vorlon around in my head

17:35.958 --> 17:37.833
because I believed!

17:41.542 --> 17:44.750
Kosh, the real Kosh
wasn't like this.

17:44.833 --> 17:48.167
I think in some odd way
he cared about us..

17:48.250 --> 17:49.500
...about me.

17:51.333 --> 17:53.375
But with you,
it's as if I'm being used

17:53.458 --> 17:56.000
and then thrown away
when I'm not needed anymore.

17:56.083 --> 17:58.458
Damn it, I have earned
some respect!

17:59.875 --> 18:02.083
And I have earned some answers.

18:05.375 --> 18:06.958
Respect?

18:08.042 --> 18:10.125
From whom?

18:26.125 --> 18:27.417
[groans]

18:30.333 --> 18:33.875
Would you know my thoughts?
Would you?

18:33.958 --> 18:36.000
[Lyta screaming]

18:38.708 --> 18:40.625
A little scream.

18:40.708 --> 18:43.250
Is that so much to ask for?

18:43.333 --> 18:46.125
I know what it is with you.
It's your pride.

18:46.208 --> 18:48.208
You would rather stay silent

18:48.292 --> 18:49.875
than give him the satisfaction

18:49.958 --> 18:52.500
of seeing you
cry out in pain, hm?

18:52.583 --> 18:56.208
I would probably do the same
myself, but not now!

18:56.292 --> 18:58.042
There's too much at stake!

18:58.125 --> 19:01.875
I need a live ally,
not a dead martyr!

19:01.958 --> 19:05.125
What you ask I cannot give.

19:05.208 --> 19:07.917
Is your pride worth more to you
than saving your world?

19:08.000 --> 19:09.250
We had a deal!

19:09.333 --> 19:12.708
You help me with Cartagia,
I help free Narn!

19:12.792 --> 19:16.375
We do not oblige conquerors.

19:16.458 --> 19:19.667
If I give him what he wants

19:19.750 --> 19:23.875
if I beg for mercy, cry out

19:23.958 --> 19:25.833
I would no longer be a Narn.

19:25.917 --> 19:29.000
And if you are dead,
are you still a Narn, then?

19:29.083 --> 19:30.083
No!

19:30.167 --> 19:32.583
You are food
for Cartagia's pets

19:32.667 --> 19:35.333
and your people
are still prisoners!

19:35.417 --> 19:38.250
They, too, are no longer Narns,
only slaves

19:38.333 --> 19:40.333
and then dead slaves.

19:40.417 --> 19:44.292
Is that what you want, G'Kar?
Is it?

19:46.667 --> 19:48.958
One scream, that's all!

19:49.042 --> 19:51.958
One little scream
and he will let you live

19:52.042 --> 19:54.625
and we will both get
what we want!

19:54.708 --> 19:56.917
You don't know
what you're asking.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
- You don't understand.
- Yes, I do!

20:04.208 --> 20:05.875
Yes, I do.

20:11.083 --> 20:12.833
[groans]

20:28.958 --> 20:32.625
- What's our ETA?
- Two, three hours.

20:32.708 --> 20:35.667
All this technology and it still
takes forever to get anywhere.

20:39.417 --> 20:40.958
Ask you a question?

20:43.708 --> 20:45.875
Assuming we live through this

20:45.958 --> 20:48.417
what do you want to do
when the war's over?

20:50.417 --> 20:52.583
[sighs]
Go home.

20:52.667 --> 20:55.500
See St. Petersburg, Paris.

20:55.583 --> 20:57.667
I wanna visit my father's grave.

20:57.750 --> 20:58.833
I didn't make it
to the funeral.

20:58.917 --> 21:01.083
I couldn't take it
at the time.

21:01.167 --> 21:02.958
Then travel.

21:03.042 --> 21:05.417
I wanna walk outside..

21:05.500 --> 21:08.542
[chuckles]
I think the last time I looked
up and saw a sky

21:08.625 --> 21:12.292
was...six years ago.

21:12.375 --> 21:14.542
Anyone special waiting for you
back home?

21:15.958 --> 21:18.917
No, not anymore.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
You?

21:21.083 --> 21:24.500
Someone.
She doesn't know it yet.

21:24.583 --> 21:27.042
That's a strange way
to pursue a relationship.

21:27.125 --> 21:29.167
I suppose so.

21:29.250 --> 21:32.542
Ah, I want this thing
to go right.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.583
I want it to be special.

21:34.667 --> 21:37.542
Oh. A romantic.

21:37.625 --> 21:38.875
I don't think I've felt that way

21:38.958 --> 21:42.083
since the first time.

21:42.167 --> 21:44.250
That's what I'm talking about.

21:47.208 --> 21:48.583
You mean, you don't..

21:50.208 --> 21:53.125
- You haven't..
- Yes.

21:54.792 --> 21:57.833
- You're a..
- Exactly.

21:57.917 --> 21:59.458
With anyone?

21:59.542 --> 22:01.667
Never met
the right person before.

22:03.167 --> 22:04.250
Wow!

22:04.333 --> 22:06.542
I thought
the first ones were rare.

22:07.917 --> 22:11.042
Well, I-I hope
she appreciates it.

22:11.125 --> 22:12.708
So do I. It's..

22:12.792 --> 22:15.208
[beeping]

22:15.292 --> 22:16.917
I'm picking something up.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.333
A unicorn? Sorry.

22:20.417 --> 22:23.667
It's some kind of
distortion field in hyperspace.

22:26.708 --> 22:28.583
It's as if someone's taken
a part of hyperspace

22:28.667 --> 22:31.750
and folded it on itself
like a pocket.

22:31.833 --> 22:33.042
It's barely noticeable.

22:33.125 --> 22:34.750
The only reason we can
detect it at all

22:34.833 --> 22:37.542
is because this thing's partly
based on Vorlon technology.

22:37.625 --> 22:41.500
- Can you track it?
- I think so. Coming about.

22:46.958 --> 22:49.375
It could be some kind
of a hiding place

22:49.458 --> 22:51.375
built right into hyperspace

22:51.458 --> 22:52.917
so no one else could find it.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.375
- First Ones?
- Maybe.

22:55.458 --> 22:57.667
Who else would know
how to do it?

22:57.750 --> 23:00.000
Approaching distortion field.

23:13.750 --> 23:15.125
[beeping]

23:15.208 --> 23:17.083
- Getting anything?
- Not sure.

23:17.167 --> 23:19.333
Instruments
are all over the place.

23:25.208 --> 23:27.708
- Marcus.
- Trying to correct.

23:27.792 --> 23:30.833
Marcus.
You better take a look.

23:42.292 --> 23:43.875
Bloody hell!

24:03.417 --> 24:05.375
[instrumental music]

24:19.500 --> 24:21.042
(man on speaker)
'What happened
after you left Babylon 5?'

24:21.125 --> 24:22.875
I told you,
I don't remember anything!

24:22.958 --> 24:24.125
(man on speaker)
'What happened
after you left Babylon 5?'

24:24.208 --> 24:25.583
I don't remember anything!

24:25.667 --> 24:27.167
God, I don't remember!

24:27.250 --> 24:28.708
I don't remember!

24:28.792 --> 24:32.375
Stop it! Stop it, stop it!

24:32.458 --> 24:33.750
No!

24:39.000 --> 24:40.458
(Zack)
'Chief?'

24:43.458 --> 24:45.792
- Chief?
- Zack?

24:46.542 --> 24:48.042
Yeah.

24:48.125 --> 24:52.042
- You okay?
- I think so.

24:52.125 --> 24:56.333
I had a bad dream.
What happened?

24:56.417 --> 24:58.833
I was about to ask you
the same thing.

24:58.917 --> 25:01.875
Last time anybody saw you
was over two weeks ago.

25:02.958 --> 25:05.042
Two weeks? No, it can't be.

25:05.125 --> 25:07.375
I-I was just..

25:08.667 --> 25:10.292
(Zack)
'Just what?'

25:13.500 --> 25:16.583
I-I-I don't know.
Every-everything's a blur.

25:16.667 --> 25:20.167
Do you remember anything that
happened to you after you left?

25:20.250 --> 25:23.042
No. No, nothing, I..

25:25.167 --> 25:27.583
I don't remember anything.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.042
Two weeks?

25:32.333 --> 25:35.167
- Where's Sheridan?
- Then you don't know?

25:37.250 --> 25:39.583
Captain Sheridan's dead.

25:39.667 --> 25:41.542
He died at Z'Ha'Dum.

25:50.833 --> 25:53.750
(Delenn)
Thank you for bringing this
to my attention, Lethke.

25:53.833 --> 25:56.375
I only wish
that I had better news.

25:56.458 --> 25:57.833
The other League worlds
are worried

25:57.917 --> 26:00.458
about your decision
to attack Z'Ha'Dum.

26:00.542 --> 26:01.792
They believe that in doing so

26:01.875 --> 26:04.042
you will only provoke
a deadly response.

26:04.125 --> 26:06.083
Response is coming either way.

26:06.167 --> 26:08.333
The Shadows
will strike again soon.

26:08.417 --> 26:09.750
We have nothing more to lose.

26:09.833 --> 26:11.125
Unfortunately,
people never believe

26:11.208 --> 26:12.458
that they have
nothing else to lose

26:12.542 --> 26:13.875
until they've already lost it.

26:13.958 --> 26:16.292
- They're afraid!
- We're all afraid.

26:16.375 --> 26:19.167
But their fear may cause them
to act against you.

26:19.250 --> 26:21.667
They asked if I would attend
an open rally

26:21.750 --> 26:23.958
to protest your actions.

26:24.042 --> 26:26.292
They hope to stir up
popular support

26:26.375 --> 26:28.625
to cause the few worlds
that have sided with you

26:28.708 --> 26:30.708
to withdraw their ships.

26:30.792 --> 26:32.125
Do you know when?

26:32.208 --> 26:34.042
Later today.
That's all I know.

26:34.125 --> 26:35.500
When I declined to participate

26:35.583 --> 26:38.083
they kept the rest
of the information from me.

26:38.167 --> 26:40.708
How do you plan to stop them?

26:40.792 --> 26:42.833
I don't.

26:42.917 --> 26:44.667
I do not agree
with what they're doing.

26:44.750 --> 26:47.917
Their fear is making them act
against their own interests

26:48.000 --> 26:51.167
but they must be free
to speak their minds..

26:51.250 --> 26:53.875
...or we have nothing left
worth fighting for.

26:53.958 --> 26:55.792
But you will be there?

26:57.208 --> 26:59.542
My voice is as free as theirs.

26:59.625 --> 27:01.500
They'll hear my side, as well.

27:01.583 --> 27:03.458
The truth will attend to itself.

27:03.542 --> 27:05.292
I hope you're right, Delenn.

27:07.125 --> 27:08.958
Oh, one last thing.

27:09.042 --> 27:12.500
We received a message from
one of our long-range probes.

27:12.583 --> 27:14.208
It picked up an unfamiliar ship

27:14.292 --> 27:15.750
moving on a hyperspace beacon

27:15.833 --> 27:18.375
that might be taking it
toward Babylon 5.

27:18.458 --> 27:20.667
'I wondered if you knew
anything about this.'

27:20.750 --> 27:22.583
No. I'm sorry.

27:22.667 --> 27:24.375
Well, if it's coming here,
I suppose

27:24.458 --> 27:26.333
we'll find out soon enough, hm?

27:28.292 --> 27:30.708
[dramatic music]

27:36.625 --> 27:39.625
Ah, I see they've dragged you
out of bed, too, hm?

27:39.708 --> 27:42.083
Yes. They told me to come,
but I still don't know why.

27:42.167 --> 27:44.542
Yes, and this one
was not being very helpful.

27:44.625 --> 27:46.458
Where are we going, hm?

27:47.542 --> 27:48.667
You don't think they know,
do you?

27:48.750 --> 27:50.500
- No. Shh.
- But it's so late.

27:50.583 --> 27:52.583
Where are we going?
I don't like it.

27:53.667 --> 27:55.917
Well, why are we stopping?

28:15.333 --> 28:17.333
Approach. We've been
waiting for you.

28:18.625 --> 28:22.458
- Majesty?
- This is my private place.

28:22.542 --> 28:25.208
I come here to think, to dream

28:25.292 --> 28:28.417
to plan for my eventual godhood

28:28.500 --> 28:29.875
and to play.

28:29.958 --> 28:33.083
Very few who come in here
ever leave again.

28:33.167 --> 28:35.167
You should feel honored.

28:39.833 --> 28:41.833
The electro whip is set

28:41.917 --> 28:44.083
'to give an increasing level
of pain'

28:44.167 --> 28:46.125
each time it is used.

28:46.208 --> 28:49.583
At 40 strokes
it will kill even a Narn.

28:50.500 --> 28:53.458
It stops when he screams.

28:53.542 --> 28:55.333
Majesty, there must be another--

28:55.417 --> 28:58.000
I must have my scream.

28:58.083 --> 29:02.125
If he does not scream,
he dies at 40.

29:08.875 --> 29:11.208
It's his choice, not mine.

29:12.542 --> 29:13.750
Proceed, one..

29:15.458 --> 29:18.333
'...two, three'

29:18.417 --> 29:21.333
four, five

29:21.417 --> 29:24.250
'six, seven'

29:24.333 --> 29:27.208
'eight, nine'

29:27.292 --> 29:30.000
'ten, eleven'

29:30.083 --> 29:32.708
twelve, thirteen

29:32.792 --> 29:35.500
fourteen, fifteen

29:35.583 --> 29:38.958
'sixteen, seventeen'

29:39.042 --> 29:42.292
eighteen, nineteen

29:42.375 --> 29:45.292
'twenty, twenty one'

29:45.375 --> 29:48.500
'twenty two, twenty three'

29:48.583 --> 29:51.667
twenty four, twenty five

29:51.750 --> 29:54.208
twenty six, twenty seven

29:54.292 --> 29:57.208
twenty eight, twenty nine

29:57.292 --> 29:58.708
thirty

29:58.792 --> 30:01.667
thirty one, thirty two

30:01.750 --> 30:05.208
'thirty three, thirty four'

30:05.292 --> 30:08.125
thirty five, thirty six

30:08.208 --> 30:11.542
thirty seven, thirty eight

30:11.625 --> 30:13.833
thirty nine..

30:13.917 --> 30:16.375
[screaming]

30:22.458 --> 30:23.667
Ah.

30:30.125 --> 30:31.833
[dramatic music]

30:34.417 --> 30:37.500
- 'Ivanova to C-and-C.'
- 'C-and-C online.'

30:37.583 --> 30:39.417
We're coming in.
Find Lyta Alexander.

30:39.500 --> 30:41.167
I need to see her
as soon as possible.

30:41.250 --> 30:42.917
(man on radio)
'Confirmed. Anything else?'

30:43.000 --> 30:44.125
Yes, I want you to run a probe

30:44.208 --> 30:46.250
on all transmissions
from sector..

30:46.333 --> 30:49.625
- 70 by 10 by 53.
- Did you get that?

30:49.708 --> 30:52.083
(man on radio)
'Got it.
What are we looking for?'

30:52.167 --> 30:53.458
I don't know.

30:53.542 --> 30:55.792
But we'll know it
when we find it.

31:02.750 --> 31:05.667
[indistinct chattering]

31:30.208 --> 31:31.292
Yes?

31:31.375 --> 31:32.917
There is quite a bit
of movement going on

31:33.000 --> 31:34.417
in the Zocalo, Delenn.

31:34.500 --> 31:37.292
I would suggest, the gathering
we were warned about

31:37.375 --> 31:39.292
is coming soon.

31:39.375 --> 31:41.500
I'll be there as fast as I can.

31:45.708 --> 31:47.667
- Anything yet?
- Nothing, commander.

31:47.750 --> 31:50.208
- Keep looking. Where's Lyta?
- We're tracking her down now.

31:50.292 --> 31:51.625
[beeping]

31:51.708 --> 31:54.542
Commander, we've got something
coming through the jumpgate.

31:54.625 --> 31:57.250
Signature and silhouette
unknown.

31:57.333 --> 31:59.000
- Could it be the Vorlons?
- I hope not.

31:59.083 --> 32:00.833
- How soon?
- Now.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.708
It's coming in on approach.

32:09.792 --> 32:12.167
Open up a frequency.

32:12.250 --> 32:14.958
I can't. I-it's not using
any of the standard frequencies.

32:15.042 --> 32:16.792
- Then it'll just have to wait--
- Commander.

32:16.875 --> 32:18.167
It's using our own access codes.

32:18.250 --> 32:20.208
I-it's activated
docking bay sequence.

32:20.292 --> 32:22.792
What? Ivanova to Security,
red alert!

32:29.417 --> 32:31.833
[alarm blaring]

32:34.583 --> 32:36.542
(man on PA)
'It's moving
into the central docking bay.'

32:36.625 --> 32:39.000
'All units move into position.'

32:50.625 --> 32:53.542
[indistinct chattering]

32:58.917 --> 33:01.167
(Drazi)
'Everyone listen!'

33:01.250 --> 33:03.375
Listen to us!

33:03.458 --> 33:06.833
There's something
that you don't know!

33:06.917 --> 33:09.667
We must tell you the truth

33:09.750 --> 33:13.167
because the Minbari never
tell anyone the whole truth.

33:13.250 --> 33:14.417
[indistinct chattering]

33:14.500 --> 33:17.958
Delenn and others
conspiring with her

33:18.042 --> 33:20.583
are risking all of your lives

33:20.667 --> 33:22.500
by organizing an attack

33:22.583 --> 33:25.250
against the homeworld
of the Shadows!

33:25.333 --> 33:27.792
[indistinct chattering]

33:29.333 --> 33:31.542
[indistinct yelling]

33:31.625 --> 33:32.708
(male #3)
'Let's go! Blue level, go!'

33:32.792 --> 33:34.208
Hey, chief. What are you doing?

33:34.292 --> 33:35.750
If someone's boarding
the station, I oughta be there.

33:35.833 --> 33:36.917
But look,
you're in no condition--

33:37.000 --> 33:38.458
Hey, tough. I'm going, huh?

33:38.542 --> 33:39.750
I'm betting you can't
spare the people

33:39.833 --> 33:41.750
to put me back to bed, can you?

33:41.833 --> 33:43.750
Alright. Come on.

33:43.833 --> 33:46.917
(Drazi)
The Shadows
have withdrawn for now.

33:47.000 --> 33:50.083
There have been no new attacks.

33:50.167 --> 33:54.000
We believe we can find
a peaceful solution.

33:56.375 --> 34:00.042
If there is another pointless
attack against Z'Ha'Dum

34:00.125 --> 34:02.250
they will destroy us all!

34:02.333 --> 34:06.083
- They will come anyway!
- You don't know that!

34:07.708 --> 34:10.167
[dramatic music]

34:35.417 --> 34:37.167
Well, I'll be damned.

34:37.250 --> 34:40.833
It has been a 1000 years
since the last Shadow War.

34:40.917 --> 34:42.792
If we do nothing
to provoke them

34:42.875 --> 34:45.625
it may be another 1000 years
before they move again.

34:45.708 --> 34:49.167
We cannot allow the fleet
to leave for Z'Ha'Dum.

34:49.250 --> 34:50.833
That fleet is our only chance!

34:50.917 --> 34:53.875
Don't listen to her.
She must be silenced!

34:55.667 --> 34:57.667
You're acting out of fear!

34:57.750 --> 34:59.917
And you're acting
out of grief and loss!

35:00.000 --> 35:02.542
If Sheridan has died,
then why not the rest of us?

35:02.625 --> 35:05.500
You cannot attack Z'Ha'Dum.

35:05.583 --> 35:08.333
No one has ever succeeded.

35:08.417 --> 35:11.208
Ships go there and never return.

35:11.292 --> 35:13.417
Lives are wasted.

35:13.500 --> 35:16.583
'Sheridan died
trying to attack Z'Ha'Dum.'

35:16.667 --> 35:19.500
No one who goes there
comes back alive.

35:24.167 --> 35:26.667
[indistinct chattering]

35:40.625 --> 35:41.917
Captain.

35:42.833 --> 35:44.708
We're sorry.

35:44.792 --> 35:46.917
We thought you were dead.

35:49.292 --> 35:50.708
I was.

35:51.625 --> 35:53.375
I'm better now.

36:00.917 --> 36:04.542
The ambassador is correct.
I went to Z'Ha'Dum.

36:05.792 --> 36:08.125
I've seen the face of the enemy.

36:09.917 --> 36:13.083
They're not gods
and they're not indestructible.

36:13.167 --> 36:15.833
I've fought them
and I've killed many of them..

36:17.083 --> 36:18.833
...and I've survived.

36:20.500 --> 36:21.875
'There is a way out of this'

36:21.958 --> 36:25.917
a way to stop this insanity
once and for all.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.250
Now, Delenn's fleet is a start.

36:29.375 --> 36:31.458
Now we have to build on it.

36:33.333 --> 36:36.625
Together we will form
the largest fleet in history

36:36.708 --> 36:39.083
not just for a battle..

36:39.167 --> 36:42.417
...but to change
the shape of the galaxy!

36:42.500 --> 36:46.250
'Not just for ourselves,
but for our children'

36:46.333 --> 36:48.750
'and our children's children.'

36:51.208 --> 36:52.458
You tell your governments

36:52.542 --> 36:54.875
that the only man
to survive Z'Ha'Dum

36:54.958 --> 36:56.792
sends this message.

36:58.583 --> 37:01.958
We can end this,
not just for now

37:02.042 --> 37:04.833
not just for the next
1000 years, but forever!

37:04.917 --> 37:06.292
(male #4)
'Yes!'

37:06.375 --> 37:10.208
I stand before you as proof
that it can be done!

37:11.667 --> 37:13.542
We can fight and we can win

37:13.625 --> 37:16.833
'but only if we do it together!'

37:19.750 --> 37:21.458
Can I count on you?

37:21.542 --> 37:23.792
[indistinct chattering]

37:24.958 --> 37:27.542
Can I count on you?
Will you stand together?

37:27.625 --> 37:29.333
- Yes!
- Yes!

37:29.417 --> 37:31.292
- Yes!
- Yes!

37:31.375 --> 37:33.917
[cheering]

37:50.583 --> 37:53.000
I thought
I'd never see you again.

37:55.542 --> 37:57.542
I'll never leave you, Delenn

37:57.625 --> 38:00.583
not if the whole universe
stood between us.

38:14.625 --> 38:17.750
(man on speaker)
'This is C-and-C
to Lyta Alexander.'

38:17.833 --> 38:19.750
'Your presence
is requested at once'

38:19.833 --> 38:22.042
'in Captain Sheridan's office.'

38:22.125 --> 38:26.083
'Repeat, this is C-and-C
to Lyta Alexander.'

38:26.167 --> 38:28.208
'Your presence
is requested at once'

38:28.292 --> 38:30.625
'in Captain Sheridan's office.'

38:30.708 --> 38:33.625
'This is C-and-C
to Lyta Alexander.'

38:33.708 --> 38:35.750
'Your presence
is requested at once'

38:35.833 --> 38:38.375
'in Captain Sheridan's office.'

38:42.542 --> 38:44.500
You know, don't you?

38:45.375 --> 38:46.875
It's started.

38:56.292 --> 38:58.417
(Sheridan)
When most
of the First Ones left

38:58.500 --> 39:02.250
two of them, the Shadows
and Vorlons, stayed behind.

39:02.333 --> 39:04.083
And their job was to keep an eye

39:04.167 --> 39:06.792
on the younger races,
help them along

39:06.875 --> 39:09.625
but they couldn't
decide or agree

39:09.708 --> 39:11.375
on what had to be done.

39:11.458 --> 39:13.208
'The Vorlons believe
that strength comes'

39:13.292 --> 39:15.250
through order and discipline.

39:15.333 --> 39:17.250
The Shadows believe
in promoting evolution

39:17.333 --> 39:19.500
through conflict, starting wars.

39:19.583 --> 39:22.125
Those are diametrically
opposite positions.

39:22.208 --> 39:23.542
Exactly.

39:23.625 --> 39:26.750
Now, at first, there was
a balance between the two sides.

39:26.833 --> 39:29.292
Yeah, they abided
by rules of engagement

39:29.375 --> 39:31.750
respected
each other's positions

39:31.833 --> 39:33.958
but that changed over time.

39:38.250 --> 39:41.000
Something, Mr. Garibaldi?

39:41.083 --> 39:44.458
I just wanna know who our
new best friend is over here.

39:44.542 --> 39:46.500
(Sheridan)
His name is Lorien.

39:46.583 --> 39:48.458
That's all you need
to know for now.

39:48.542 --> 39:50.250
Yeah? Who decided that?

39:50.333 --> 39:52.750
- He did.
- Well, isn't that convenient?

39:52.833 --> 39:55.042
Michael, what the hell is that?
I told you I trust him.

39:55.125 --> 39:58.000
I know, I know. Secrets
on top of secrets, right?

39:58.083 --> 40:00.083
I'm getting too old
for this stuff.

40:00.167 --> 40:02.667
[laughs]

40:02.750 --> 40:04.833
What? That's funny to you?

40:04.917 --> 40:08.917
Lorien is...older than he looks.

40:13.417 --> 40:16.625
John, what I don't
understand is

40:16.708 --> 40:19.167
why the wars,
why the fighting?

40:19.250 --> 40:21.333
If each side agreed
to respect the other--

40:21.417 --> 40:23.500
Oh, I don't know
who started it first, Delenn

40:23.583 --> 40:26.000
but somewhere along the line,
they both decided

40:26.083 --> 40:29.000
that their way
was the right way, the only way.

40:29.083 --> 40:32.250
And we've been caught
in the middle ever since.

40:32.333 --> 40:34.500
Hello, captain.

40:34.583 --> 40:36.333
Welcome back, John.

40:36.417 --> 40:37.375
Hey.

40:37.458 --> 40:39.292
[laughs]

40:40.750 --> 40:42.875
Ah..

40:42.958 --> 40:46.625
Hey, I heard that you three
went to Z'Ha'Dum after me.

40:46.708 --> 40:49.042
That was foolish and dangerous.

40:50.625 --> 40:52.917
And I can't thank you enough
for trying.

40:54.750 --> 40:57.500
Listen, I hate to bring this up
at a time like this.

40:57.583 --> 40:59.042
It seems like every time
we get good news

40:59.125 --> 41:01.167
and you guys coming back alive

41:01.250 --> 41:02.375
there's always something
that comes up

41:02.458 --> 41:04.292
and smacks us in the head.

41:04.375 --> 41:06.375
What is it?

41:06.458 --> 41:09.208
[sighs]
When Marcus and I were out
looking for the First Ones

41:09.292 --> 41:12.208
we came across a Vorlon fleet
hiding in hyperspace.

41:12.292 --> 41:17.042
Not dozens, not hundreds,
but thousands of ships.

41:17.125 --> 41:20.458
A couple of them
were three, four miles across.

41:20.542 --> 41:21.833
We tried to track them

41:21.917 --> 41:24.250
but we lost them somewhere
around Sector 70.

41:24.333 --> 41:26.417
There's a Shadow base
not far from there.

41:26.500 --> 41:28.583
Exactly,
so as soon as we got back

41:28.667 --> 41:30.542
I had C-and-C
monitor that area

41:30.625 --> 41:33.500
for any transmissions,
anything unusual.

41:33.583 --> 41:34.583
The Shadow base was located

41:34.667 --> 41:37.708
on a planet called Arcata VII

41:37.792 --> 41:39.667
but it's not there anymore.

41:39.750 --> 41:43.500
- The base?
- No, the planet.

41:44.958 --> 41:47.667
They destroyed..

41:47.750 --> 41:50.417
They destroyed an entire planet.

41:50.500 --> 41:51.708
Lyta.

41:53.167 --> 41:55.167
There are over four million
people on Arcata VII.

41:55.250 --> 41:57.833
You, you can't be serious.

41:57.917 --> 42:01.292
This latest incident, everything
that's happened lately

42:01.375 --> 42:04.417
it's convinced the Vorlons
that their only alternative

42:04.500 --> 42:07.583
is to destroy the Shadows
and anyone touched by them

42:07.667 --> 42:10.417
like an infection,
you have to cut it out.

42:10.500 --> 42:12.500
And any healthy tissue
that's cut out along the way

42:12.583 --> 42:14.875
well, that's okay because
it's all for a good cause.

42:14.958 --> 42:18.833
Since the Shadows are about
to strike back any time now..

42:18.917 --> 42:20.542
...we're caught
in the middle again.

42:20.625 --> 42:22.417
In Valen's name.

42:22.500 --> 42:24.625
We could barely stop
the Shadows.

42:24.708 --> 42:26.958
How do we stop them
and the Vorlons?

42:27.042 --> 42:30.792
I don't know, all I know
is that unless you do stop them

42:30.875 --> 42:33.292
it won't matter
who wins and who loses

42:33.375 --> 42:35.958
because none of us,
not a single world

42:36.042 --> 42:38.917
in 70 light years
in any direction

42:39.000 --> 42:40.875
will live to see it.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.917
