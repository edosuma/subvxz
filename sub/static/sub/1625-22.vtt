WEBVTT

00:02.171 --> 00:05.207
Get the birthday candle ready,
'cause...

00:05.458 --> 00:09.594
Here comes Chestnut's
carrot cake!

00:09.595 --> 00:11.763
I know we want this
to be special,

00:11.764 --> 00:13.431
but Chestnut is a horse.

00:13.432 --> 00:15.433
Any day he's not being made
into an Ikea meatball

00:15.434 --> 00:18.770
is a birthday.

00:18.771 --> 00:21.139
And remember, even though
it's his tenth birthday,

00:21.140 --> 00:24.642
we have to pretend he's six or
he'll be in a bad mood all week.

00:27.413 --> 00:28.813
Surprise!

00:28.814 --> 00:32.217
Happy Birthday, Chestnut!

00:32.218 --> 00:34.119
Max! He was supposed
to do that!

00:34.120 --> 00:36.154
What?
I know what he wished for.

00:36.155 --> 00:38.256
That one day,
he and I live in a world

00:38.257 --> 00:39.724
where our love is recognized

00:39.725 --> 00:42.293
and we have the same rights
as gay couples.

00:42.294 --> 00:44.963
There you go, baby.

00:44.964 --> 00:47.399
Hey, look,
his shoe just fell off.

00:47.400 --> 00:51.302
Or maybe he kicked it off 'cause
he's getting ready to par-tay.

00:51.803 --> 00:53.338
What are we gonna do?

00:53.339 --> 00:54.572
We don't have any money.

00:54.573 --> 00:56.174
I wanted a massage last week,

00:56.175 --> 00:57.675
so I just sat next
to someone on the bus

00:57.676 --> 00:59.844
who looked like he'd touch me.

01:00.345 --> 01:02.881
I may have an idea
how we can get 'em.

01:02.882 --> 01:05.817
A guy I picked up at Oktoberfest
is a blacksmith.

01:05.818 --> 01:07.252
At least I think he was.

01:07.253 --> 01:11.254
I remember a leather apron and
something being heated in a fire.

01:12.258 --> 01:14.626

01:16.262 --> 01:20.332

01:28.473 --> 01:30.274
Well, I found my blacksmith.

01:30.275 --> 01:31.809
He now shares
an artisan barn

01:31.810 --> 01:35.213
with a lady who makes clothing
out of bees.

01:35.214 --> 01:37.215
I guess that's why
our cupcake shop didn't work.

01:37.216 --> 01:40.351
We weren't providing a service
that everyone needs.

01:40.352 --> 01:41.719
I looked at our boy,

01:41.720 --> 01:44.222
and not only does Chestnut
need four new shoes,

01:44.223 --> 01:45.723
he has a hoof fungus.

01:45.724 --> 01:49.093
A hoof fungus?
That's so ghetto.

01:49.094 --> 01:50.695
I'm pretty sure
he got it from me

01:50.696 --> 01:53.364
because we shower together.

01:53.365 --> 01:56.467
And the cost of new shoes
and vet fee? $1,400.

01:56.468 --> 01:58.236
Max, I feel awful.

01:58.237 --> 01:59.737
I'm a bad mother.

01:59.738 --> 02:00.972
You're not a bad mother.

02:00.973 --> 02:04.742
I know bad mothers.
I came out of one.

02:04.743 --> 02:07.178
Ladies, what's happening
over there?

02:07.179 --> 02:09.513
You know a gathering of more
than two white people

02:09.514 --> 02:12.383
makes me nervous.

02:12.384 --> 02:13.718
Earl, one of them's Asian.

02:13.719 --> 02:16.554
Ah, same thing.

02:16.555 --> 02:18.155
Who would I talk to
about the diner?

02:18.156 --> 02:19.991
We're interested
in renting this location

02:19.992 --> 02:21.425
to film a TV show.

02:21.426 --> 02:24.629
We think your diner would be
a great place to kill someone.

02:24.630 --> 02:25.863
I get it.

02:25.864 --> 02:27.798
'Cause every time I come
in here, I die a little.

02:27.799 --> 02:29.400
Here's my card.

02:29.401 --> 02:31.102
Tom Woo, <i>Law & Order:</i>
<i>Special Victims Unit.</i>

02:31.103 --> 02:34.505
Shut your face, Tom Woo!

02:34.506 --> 02:38.309
I love all the <i>Law & Orders,</i>
especially <i>SVU.</i>

02:38.310 --> 02:40.311
Their stories are ripped
from the headlines,

02:40.312 --> 02:41.779
and I don't read
the newspaper,

02:41.780 --> 02:43.714
so that's where I get
all my news.

02:43.715 --> 02:45.283
Cool.
Let me go get the director.

02:45.284 --> 02:46.784
That's him over there.

02:46.785 --> 02:51.122
Look how cute the director is.
He's my rugged guy type.

02:51.123 --> 02:52.657
Not really rugged at all,

02:52.658 --> 02:54.158
but buys expensive,
rugged-looking clothing

02:54.159 --> 02:56.060
from Saks 5th Avenue.

02:56.561 --> 02:58.596
Hi.
DJ Kingsley.

02:58.597 --> 02:59.797
Nice beard.

02:59.798 --> 03:01.098
You grow out that stubble

03:01.099 --> 03:03.100
or just set your razor
to "Jason Statham."

03:03.101 --> 03:04.935
Excuse me, sir.

03:04.936 --> 03:06.437
You've got a great face.

03:06.438 --> 03:08.072
Have you ever done
any extra work?

03:08.073 --> 03:10.441
Well, I was
in the 1973 classic

03:10.442 --> 03:13.377
<i>Scream, Blackula, Scream.</i>

03:13.378 --> 03:16.047
Pam Grier kicked me
in the nuts

03:16.048 --> 03:19.150
and called me a "jive turkey."

03:19.151 --> 03:20.484
If you'd consider it,

03:20.485 --> 03:21.952
I'd love to have your look
in the episode.

03:21.953 --> 03:23.254
Hey, what about me?

03:23.255 --> 03:25.256
You can shave my head,
drag me behind a car,

03:25.257 --> 03:27.558
or anything else
I've already done for free.

03:27.559 --> 03:30.294
Sure. And you must be
an actress.

03:30.295 --> 03:32.496
You're way too pretty
to just be a waitress.

03:32.497 --> 03:34.231
Thank you!

03:34.232 --> 03:37.268
In fact I have done
a little acting.

03:37.269 --> 03:42.873
In high school, I portrayed
Fantine in <i>Les Miserables.</i>

03:43.374 --> 03:46.977
Just hearing you say that
makes me "miser-obble."

03:46.978 --> 03:48.746
Well, how about it?

03:48.747 --> 03:51.015
You wanna hang with me and be an
extra on <i>Special Victims Unit?</i>

03:51.016 --> 03:52.383
It pays 112 a day

03:52.384 --> 03:54.118
plus whatever
you normally make in tips.

03:54.119 --> 03:57.121
Oh, so about 115?
I'm in.

03:57.122 --> 03:59.623
Mama needs a new pair
of horseshoes.

03:59.624 --> 04:01.292
So where's the boss?

04:01.293 --> 04:04.295
I'm the boss, but I'll get
the guy who owns the place.

04:04.296 --> 04:06.097
Oleg!

04:06.098 --> 04:07.431
They're shooting
a TV show here,

04:07.432 --> 04:08.799
and the back of my head
or the side of my boob

04:08.800 --> 04:10.267
is gonna be in it!

04:10.268 --> 04:11.936
Good for you, Max.

04:11.937 --> 04:14.138
I was on Ukraine's version
of <i>Big Brother</i> once,

04:14.139 --> 04:17.173
better known as
<i>Just living in Ukraine.</i>

04:18.844 --> 04:21.478
Han! <i>Law and Order:</i>
<i>Special Victims Unit</i>

04:21.480 --> 04:23.581
wants to shoot in the diner,
and if you don't say yes,

04:23.582 --> 04:26.650
you'll be my special victim
when I cut your unit off.

04:27.351 --> 04:28.652
Please say yes, Han.

04:28.653 --> 04:30.388
They're gonna pay us
to be in the background.

04:30.389 --> 04:32.156
But do you know how to act?

04:32.157 --> 04:34.091
Actually we do.

04:34.092 --> 04:38.429
My acting's method,
whereas hers is more meth head.

04:40.499 --> 04:41.899
Hey, come in.

04:41.900 --> 04:44.668
And remember, if he says no,
he doesn't mean it.

04:44.669 --> 04:46.737
He just wants you
to flirt with him a little bit.

04:46.738 --> 04:48.172
Not so fast, Max.

04:48.173 --> 04:51.409
Hello, I'm Han Lee,
the owner and proprietor.

04:51.410 --> 04:52.643
Oh, "proprietor."

04:52.644 --> 04:55.012
That's word's bigger
than you are.

04:55.713 --> 04:57.515
What kinda compensation
do you want?

04:57.516 --> 05:00.651
Whoa, whoa,
my Asian brother.

05:00.652 --> 05:02.887
Slow down!
Let's enjoy the dance.

05:02.888 --> 05:04.355
We'd like to shoot here.

05:04.356 --> 05:06.123
It's got the right amount
of funk and skank.

05:06.124 --> 05:07.691
If we do real good in this

05:07.692 --> 05:09.827
and get a spin-off, that'll be
the name of our show--

05:09.828 --> 05:11.829
<i>Funk and Skank.</i>

05:11.830 --> 05:14.231
Okay,
but I don't wanna be Skank.

05:14.232 --> 05:17.134
Oh, clearly I'm Skank.

05:17.135 --> 05:18.936
And may I say I'm honored

05:18.937 --> 05:21.705
I have such a worthy opponent
to barter with.

05:25.310 --> 05:27.545
Dude, I'm from Pasadena.

05:29.681 --> 05:31.081
I can't believe this!

05:31.082 --> 05:32.550
I never thought I'd be
in a TV show

05:32.551 --> 05:34.752
where no one was yelling,
"You are not the father!"

05:42.812 --> 05:45.147
Let's go.
Bring in the waitress extras.

05:45.148 --> 05:46.815
Ooh, I love these uniforms!

05:47.316 --> 05:48.917
I feel like Brenda
from <i>90210</i>

05:48.918 --> 05:52.020
when she was dressed as that
'50s waitress at the peach pit.

05:53.021 --> 05:54.890
Well, when we're the big stars
of <i>Funk and Skank,</i>

05:54.891 --> 05:56.525
we won't have to wear
any uniforms.

05:57.526 --> 05:59.227
But wait,
aren't Funk and Skank cops?

05:59.728 --> 06:02.363
Uh, no, they're hookers.

06:02.364 --> 06:04.065
How about a compromise?

06:04.066 --> 06:06.401
Cops by day,
prostitutes by night?

06:06.402 --> 06:08.703
You know, copstitutes.

06:09.204 --> 06:12.307
Either way,
we're New York's finest.

06:12.308 --> 06:14.909
Okay, everybody, ready!
Here we go.

06:14.910 --> 06:17.312
Look at Earl
over there.

06:17.313 --> 06:18.980
Good luck, Earl!

06:18.981 --> 06:20.915
Camera on the door.
Scene eight, take one.

06:20.916 --> 06:24.752
And action!
Shooter comes in.

06:28.591 --> 06:30.825
And cut! Good!
Reset.

06:30.826 --> 06:33.494
Earl, that was inspiring.

06:33.495 --> 06:36.264
I hope everyone who sees you
goes out and ignores a crime.

06:36.265 --> 06:39.300
It was like that scene
was about the cash register guy.

06:39.301 --> 06:41.102
You really brought
something extra.

06:41.103 --> 06:42.937
I smell an Emmy.

06:42.938 --> 06:45.607
Oh, that's weed.

06:45.608 --> 06:48.610
Hi. Sorry we haven't gotten
to you guys yet.

06:48.611 --> 06:49.911
Why don't you hang out
in the office?

06:49.912 --> 06:51.279
I hear there's good Sushi.

06:51.280 --> 06:52.580
You look pretty.

06:53.281 --> 06:55.817
I think the director
kinda likes me.

06:55.818 --> 06:58.621
Well, I don't know about him,
but his penis does.

06:59.622 --> 07:01.556
Okay, camera on the door.

07:01.557 --> 07:03.424
Scene eight, take two.

07:03.425 --> 07:06.227
And action!
Shooter comes in.

07:06.728 --> 07:09.330
Bang! Bang!

07:09.831 --> 07:11.165
Cut!

07:11.566 --> 07:13.568
Excuse me,
how did you get through?

07:13.569 --> 07:15.203
Oh, please.

07:15.204 --> 07:16.604
I once got through
the Berlin Wall.

07:16.605 --> 07:20.475
You think two kids
with walkie-talkies can stop me?

07:20.476 --> 07:22.877
Damn, this room's got
a sweet spread.

07:22.878 --> 07:25.413
Free Sushi? Uh-yes.

07:25.814 --> 07:28.483
Free dessert? Uh-duh.

07:28.484 --> 07:29.751
This is great.

07:29.752 --> 07:31.486
We've gotta figure out a way
to get paid

07:31.487 --> 07:34.289
to sit around, eat free food,
and do nothing more often.

07:34.290 --> 07:38.159
Oh, I think you cracked
that code a long time ago.

07:38.160 --> 07:39.694
Would it be tacky

07:39.695 --> 07:41.596
if I packed some Sushi
in my purse for later?

07:41.597 --> 07:44.132
Already packed mine,
already packed yours.

07:44.833 --> 07:47.402
This is the VIP lounge.

07:47.403 --> 07:51.439
See? The shrimp
have already been de-turded.

07:51.440 --> 07:52.607
Oh, hi, girls.

07:52.608 --> 07:56.678
You finally got new uniforms.
You look stupid.

07:56.679 --> 07:59.280
These are actually
from the costume department

07:59.281 --> 08:01.282
of a little show called
<i>Law & Order: SVU</i>

08:01.283 --> 08:03.217
that Max and I
are costarring in.

08:03.218 --> 08:07.588
Costars? Honey, please.
You two are just extras.

08:07.589 --> 08:12.660
Um, extra paid
and full of purse Sushi.

08:12.661 --> 08:14.962
- They're ready for you two.
- Oh! Be right there.

08:14.963 --> 08:17.465
Just gonna put my purse
in the fridge.

08:17.466 --> 08:19.934
Thomas. Tom. T-pain.
Can we chat?

08:19.935 --> 08:21.235
What is it, dude?

08:21.236 --> 08:23.738
Your crew got soy sauce
all over my computer.

08:23.739 --> 08:26.574
And according to our agreement,
you must pay all the damages.

08:26.575 --> 08:29.210
- How much do you want?
- $300.

08:29.211 --> 08:31.012
It's a piece of crap.

08:31.013 --> 08:33.514
But it was a gift
from my father.

08:33.515 --> 08:35.650
And you know how important
family is in our culture.

08:35.650 --> 08:38.986
Again, I don't.
I was raised by two white women.

08:38.986 --> 08:40.621
Oh, hey, hey.

08:40.621 --> 08:44.058
Yes, uh, who do I talk to
about becoming a star?

08:47.396 --> 08:49.864
This is so exciting!

08:49.865 --> 08:52.166
God! That woman keeps
pushing my head down.

08:52.167 --> 08:55.236
I feel like I'm on a date
with her.

08:55.237 --> 08:57.405
Okay, so you guys are here
behind the counter,

08:57.406 --> 08:58.740
doing your waitress thing.

08:58.741 --> 09:00.174
Shooter aims for the cook

09:00.175 --> 09:02.577
but hits her,
our featured waitress.

09:02.578 --> 09:04.879
Hey, didn't I already see you
on <i>SVU?</i>

09:04.880 --> 09:06.414
Oh, yeah, I remember.

09:06.415 --> 09:08.182
They found your head
in a mini fridge in the Hudson.

09:08.183 --> 09:09.517
I knew I recognized you.

09:09.518 --> 09:11.285
Wait, we've already
killed you?

09:11.286 --> 09:13.154
Sorry, babe, you're out.

09:13.155 --> 09:14.789
Aw.

09:14.790 --> 09:16.791
Well, you gave great head.

09:16.792 --> 09:19.260
Tom, we gotta bump someone up
to the featured waitress.

09:19.261 --> 09:21.129
Pays 1,000 more bucks.

09:21.130 --> 09:22.463
Max, that could be
the extra money

09:22.464 --> 09:23.765
we need for Chestnut.

09:23.766 --> 09:25.266
Could one of us do it?

09:25.267 --> 09:26.634
Can either of you act like
you've been hit with a bullet?

09:26.635 --> 09:28.503
Well, it just so happens

09:28.504 --> 09:30.838
I have been hit
by a bullet twice--

09:30.839 --> 09:33.107
once at a 7-Eleven
and once running away

09:33.108 --> 09:34.542
in the parking lot
of a 7-Eleven.

09:34.543 --> 09:36.577
So yeah, I think I got this.

09:36.978 --> 09:38.546
I'm thinking maybe a blonde
would be better.

09:39.047 --> 09:39.847
Caroline?

09:39.848 --> 09:42.750
Well, I did have a pretty
convincing death scene

09:42.751 --> 09:44.685
as Fantine,
and I died like--

09:44.686 --> 09:47.422
well, should I just show you?

09:49.000 --> 09:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:58.934 --> 10:02.370
You are such a nerd.

10:04.039 --> 10:05.239
That's great, Caroline.

10:05.240 --> 10:06.441
Special effects,

10:06.442 --> 10:07.809
put the blood device
on Caroline.

10:07.810 --> 10:08.976
She's our special victim.

10:08.977 --> 10:10.411
Really? I got it?

10:10.412 --> 10:12.413
Yes, but a little less
"French Revolution,"

10:12.414 --> 10:15.383
and a lot more
"Face down on the floor."

10:15.884 --> 10:18.953
You can't take a shot.
You can't even do a shot.

10:18.954 --> 10:21.589
Don't be mad, Max.
I'm doing this for Chestnut.

10:21.590 --> 10:23.758
And it's not my fault
he liked my death scene.

10:23.759 --> 10:26.828
He liked your death scene
with his penis.

10:27.329 --> 10:30.264
Wow, Max, show business really
brings out the worst in you.

10:30.265 --> 10:31.968
You haven't seen me
at a wedding.

10:34.269 --> 10:35.870
Hello!
You just put your hand

10:35.871 --> 10:37.472
down a woman's blouse
without asking?

10:37.473 --> 10:39.540
Every day.

10:40.241 --> 10:42.143
Well, here.
Can I help you?

10:42.144 --> 10:45.713
No, it's a union thing.

10:45.714 --> 10:47.515
Aren't you in there
a little long?

10:47.516 --> 10:50.084
Yeah. Let me just--

10:52.321 --> 10:53.921
Caroline, that special
effects rig you're wearing

10:53.922 --> 10:55.089
is very sensitive,

10:55.090 --> 10:56.257
so don't let anything
near your chest.

10:56.258 --> 10:57.794
Except me.

11:01.195 --> 11:02.630
And don't be nervous.

11:02.631 --> 11:04.632
The camera's gonna love you.
How could it not?

11:04.633 --> 11:06.601
DJ, stop flirting with me.

11:06.602 --> 11:10.172
I'm gonna die soon
and you'll never get over me.

11:11.173 --> 11:14.008
Promise you'll die soon?

11:15.009 --> 11:16.310
Max, I'm about to be shot,

11:16.311 --> 11:18.279
and I can't die
with bad blood between us.

11:18.280 --> 11:20.548
We're good.
You're living my dream, girl.

11:20.549 --> 11:23.017
- Do me proud.
- I will.

11:23.018 --> 11:25.253
No! Don't hug with it!

11:31.727 --> 11:33.761
Caroline,
you set the thing off.

11:33.762 --> 11:35.229
We weren't rolling.

11:35.230 --> 11:38.833
Really? That's too bad,
because that was gold.

11:39.334 --> 11:42.270
That's a wrap, everybody.
We'll pick it up tomorrow.

11:42.271 --> 11:44.572
I'm so sorry.
It just went off.

11:44.573 --> 11:47.074
Prettiest screw-up all day.

11:47.075 --> 11:48.309
After you get cleaned up,

11:48.310 --> 11:49.844
why don't we have dinner
at my hotel?

11:49.845 --> 11:51.712
Dinner?
Yeah, I'd like that.

11:51.713 --> 11:53.080
Let's say 8:00.

11:53.081 --> 11:55.650
My assistant will give you
the address and my room number.

11:57.719 --> 11:59.720
You know, this is exactly
how you look in all my dreams

11:59.721 --> 12:01.389
where I shoot you.

12:01.390 --> 12:03.791
The director just invited me
to dinner at his hotel,

12:03.792 --> 12:05.326
but it's in his room.

12:05.327 --> 12:06.527
- Do you think he--
- Yes.

12:06.528 --> 12:07.628
- Is that why he--
- Yes.

12:07.629 --> 12:08.796
- Will you come with?
- Yes.

12:08.797 --> 12:09.964
Maybe you're wrong.

12:09.965 --> 12:11.165
Maybe he thought my audition
was really--

12:11.166 --> 12:12.333
No.

12:12.334 --> 12:15.804
Caroline, next time,
maybe a little less.

12:24.035 --> 12:24.969
Now, remember.

12:24.970 --> 12:27.337
This director slips you anything
that looks like a sweet tart,

12:27.338 --> 12:29.172
it's probably that date rape
drug that knocks you out

12:29.173 --> 12:30.607
and distorts your memory.

12:30.608 --> 12:32.675
Or at least that's what it does
to the guys I give it to.

12:33.676 --> 12:36.379
It's never gonna get to that.
I have my own date rape drug.

12:36.630 --> 12:38.197
I talk about myself
incessantly

12:38.198 --> 12:40.700
till guys get bored
and pass out.

12:40.701 --> 12:42.802
So if that doesn't work,
what are your limits?

12:42.803 --> 12:44.403
A little over the sweater,
under sweater,

12:44.404 --> 12:47.507
a little front door, back door,
a little secret staircase?

12:47.508 --> 12:50.643
I don't know what that is,
but no one goes up my staircase,

12:50.644 --> 12:52.178
not even for Chestnut.

12:52.179 --> 12:54.280
At the most,
I'll do kissing.

12:55.582 --> 12:56.816
You are thinking
like an extra.

12:56.817 --> 12:58.684
You need to think
like a star

12:58.685 --> 12:59.952
if you're gonna
buy Chestnut shoes,

12:59.953 --> 13:02.522
then therapy, then a way
out of scientology.

13:04.124 --> 13:06.692
Oh, hi.
You brought company.

13:06.693 --> 13:09.529
Yes, she's my ride.
We share a subway card.

13:09.530 --> 13:10.830
Well, she uses the card.

13:10.831 --> 13:12.832
I jump the turnstile
and she pretends to chase me,

13:12.833 --> 13:15.101
yelling "Don't worry, I'll get her!"

13:15.102 --> 13:16.569
Well, come on in.

13:16.570 --> 13:18.037
Stay for a glass
of champagne, Max.

13:18.038 --> 13:19.972
Oh, and don't worry about
taking the subway home alone.

13:19.973 --> 13:21.407
My driver can take you.

13:21.408 --> 13:22.742
Now I'm torn.

13:22.743 --> 13:24.110
Because as much
as I don't want you

13:24.111 --> 13:25.444
to have sex
against your will,

13:25.445 --> 13:28.381
I do wanna roll up
to the McDonald's in a limo.

13:28.382 --> 13:29.782
There's no rush.

13:29.783 --> 13:31.083
Come on, let's sit down
and hang out.

13:31.084 --> 13:33.119
It was really nice of you
to invite me up here

13:33.120 --> 13:35.555
to have a casual,
work-related dinner.

13:35.556 --> 13:40.226
Max there, Caroline there,
and me, well, here.

13:40.227 --> 13:42.595
Can't turn it off,
still directing.

13:44.398 --> 13:47.266
Oh! You know,
I love this hotel.

13:47.267 --> 13:49.335
I came here once
to do a photo shoot

13:49.336 --> 13:50.803
for a "20 under 20:

13:50.804 --> 13:52.438
Teen millionaires
to watch" spread,

13:52.439 --> 13:55.708
and I remember I had
just gotten my haircut,

13:55.709 --> 13:56.976
which was a big decision,

13:56.977 --> 13:58.811
'cause I was kinda known
for my long hair.

13:58.812 --> 14:00.479
And he wanted
to take an inch off,

14:00.480 --> 14:01.747
which doesn't sound
like a big deal,

14:01.748 --> 14:03.818
but when you're known
for your long hair...

14:05.819 --> 14:09.722
People are expecting
to see you with long hair.

14:10.523 --> 14:11.657
So was that okay?

14:11.658 --> 14:14.160
Oh!
Yeah, sure.

14:14.161 --> 14:15.461
It--it's just Max is here,

14:15.462 --> 14:16.662
and I don't want her
to feel left out.

14:16.663 --> 14:19.365
Sorry.
Got it.

14:23.002 --> 14:24.470
That was nice.

14:24.971 --> 14:26.439
You're a good kisser.

14:26.440 --> 14:29.408
Are you eating
a cinnamon altoid?

14:30.409 --> 14:32.878
I'm eating
a cinnamon altoid.

14:35.948 --> 14:38.618
Well,
then I just tasted you.

14:38.619 --> 14:40.820
Look, DJ, I think
you have the wrong idea.

14:42.322 --> 14:44.056
Oh!
Hold that thought.

14:44.057 --> 14:46.492
I would never interrupt this
for a work call,

14:46.493 --> 14:49.929
but it's my wife and I wanna
say "good night" to the kids.

14:50.630 --> 14:51.864
That guy's a player.

14:51.865 --> 14:53.532
I'm not talking my way
out of this one.

14:53.533 --> 14:55.067
We're screwed.

14:55.068 --> 14:56.802
Yeah!
He's got a high tolerance.

14:56.803 --> 15:00.172
Your long-hair speech
almost roofied me.

15:00.173 --> 15:02.608
What do we do, Max?
I don't want to offend him.

15:02.609 --> 15:04.877
We need that extra money
for Chestnut.

15:04.878 --> 15:06.846
This is the oldest tale
in the book--

15:06.847 --> 15:09.548
a woman forced to trade her body
to get her child shoes.

15:09.549 --> 15:11.284
It's Shakespearian,
it's Dickensian,

15:11.285 --> 15:13.119
it's Kardashian.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.887
Look at the bright side.

15:14.888 --> 15:16.656
You already thought
he was sexy,

15:16.657 --> 15:18.424
so you were probably
gonna sleep with him eventually.

15:18.425 --> 15:19.859
And now that he's married,

15:19.860 --> 15:21.427
you know he won't cheat on you
with somebody else

15:21.428 --> 15:23.229
because you're
that somebody else.

15:23.230 --> 15:25.231
You a side bitch!

15:25.232 --> 15:28.200
No, Max, I can
just tell him how I feel.

15:28.201 --> 15:29.435
Besides, he probably
already got it.

15:29.436 --> 15:31.570
You heard me tell him
he read the signs wrong.

15:35.442 --> 15:39.879
Apparently the sign he read
said "Three-way up ahead."

15:39.880 --> 15:41.213
Pretty good, right?

15:41.214 --> 15:42.748
Hit show, wife, kids.

15:42.749 --> 15:44.850
Still find time
to get to the gym.

15:44.851 --> 15:47.253
So you guys need to drink
a little more before we do this?

15:47.254 --> 15:49.355
'Cause I don't.

15:49.356 --> 15:50.723
All right,
I'm just gonna say this

15:50.724 --> 15:52.291
before that towel
comes off.

15:52.292 --> 15:54.627
I think you've misread
the signals here.

15:54.628 --> 15:56.729
Really!
That sucks.

15:56.730 --> 15:59.031
I'm sorry.
These things happen.

15:59.032 --> 16:00.766
It reminds me of that time
I had tea

16:00.767 --> 16:03.502
with that prince in Dubai
and he thought he bought me.

16:04.003 --> 16:05.838
Turns out he bought
a different blonde.

16:05.839 --> 16:08.107
Oh, men!

16:15.214 --> 16:17.116
- Good morning, DJ.
- Morning!

16:18.117 --> 16:19.385
See, Max?
No hard feelings.

16:19.386 --> 16:21.687
I told you
it was gonna work out.

16:22.188 --> 16:25.091
Hi! I'm ready
for my fake blood pouch.

16:26.760 --> 16:30.429
Um, I think you got
the wrong breasts.

16:30.430 --> 16:32.698
But for a rough guy,
you got a soft touch.

16:32.699 --> 16:33.899
Yup.

16:33.900 --> 16:35.468
There's been a change.

16:35.469 --> 16:37.870
Uh, Max is now getting featured,
and you're in the B.G.--

16:37.871 --> 16:39.505
Background.

16:39.506 --> 16:41.807
- These are real?
- Yep.

16:41.808 --> 16:44.410
Nice job.

16:44.411 --> 16:47.046
You hear that, Max?
Now I'm in the B.G.

16:47.047 --> 16:49.548
I didn't do DJ,
so I'm in the B.G.

16:49.549 --> 16:51.183
Max!

16:51.184 --> 16:53.586
We have time for
one full take before lunch,

16:53.587 --> 16:55.921
then we'll come back and do
the rest of your coverage after.

16:55.922 --> 16:57.723
Hey, maybe you and I could
have a little lunch together

16:57.724 --> 16:58.991
in my trailer.

16:58.992 --> 17:01.093
Well,
I do love a trailer.

17:01.094 --> 17:02.895
Okay, let's stay
on schedule, people.

17:02.896 --> 17:04.730
My kid's reading a poem
at school.

17:04.731 --> 17:07.031
By the way,
your rack looks fantastic.

17:07.032 --> 17:10.703
You seem like
a great dad.

17:10.704 --> 17:12.771
DJ, is this
about last night,

17:12.772 --> 17:14.006
'cause I wouldn't
wear a towel?

17:14.007 --> 17:16.040
No.
No, we're good.

17:16.041 --> 17:17.810
I don't wanna see that.
Bury her deep.

17:17.810 --> 17:19.145
"Bury her deep"?

17:19.146 --> 17:20.880
Did he just say,
"Bury her deep"?

17:20.881 --> 17:23.015
Caroline, you need
to work back there.

17:23.016 --> 17:24.884
Is this how Hollywood
treats women?

17:24.885 --> 17:26.786
This is how Hollywood
treats everyone.

17:26.787 --> 17:28.186
Everybody ready.

17:28.188 --> 17:31.624
Max, if you do this,
you'll be getting paid for sex.

17:31.625 --> 17:34.226
Well, it's about time.

17:34.227 --> 17:35.728
Places, everyone.

17:35.729 --> 17:39.131
You don't have to do this.
Chestnut is my horse.

17:39.132 --> 17:41.400
And action!
Max, you're wiping the counter.

17:41.401 --> 17:43.669
The killer comes in.
You look up.

17:43.670 --> 17:45.004
Don't do it.

17:45.005 --> 17:46.405
We can find money
somewhere else.

17:46.406 --> 17:48.574
Cut!
Tom, I don't wanna see her.

17:48.575 --> 17:50.409
- Caroline.
- Here they come.

17:50.410 --> 17:52.778
Come on, everybody.
Back to one.

17:52.779 --> 17:55.614
And action!
Max, you're wiping the counter.

17:55.615 --> 17:58.217
The killer comes in.
You look up.

17:58.218 --> 18:00.586
Pick up!

18:02.622 --> 18:04.824
Max, seriously,
it's not worth it.

18:04.825 --> 18:06.592
Cut!
Get her out of there.

18:06.593 --> 18:08.894
Reset, reset.
Sorry about all that, people.

18:08.895 --> 18:10.229
Now, let's give me
the bullet

18:10.230 --> 18:12.932
I've been waiting for
my whole life.

18:14.433 --> 18:15.968
I haven't felt
this unwanted

18:15.969 --> 18:18.204
since I tried to teach
those inner-city school kids

18:18.205 --> 18:19.338
how to knit.

18:19.339 --> 18:20.840
Seriously Caroline,
you have to stay here,

18:20.841 --> 18:22.074
away from the shot,

18:22.075 --> 18:23.242
or neither of you
is gonna be paid.

18:23.243 --> 18:25.811
Hey, Tom, you know
what this scene needs?

18:25.812 --> 18:28.981
A little more cashier.

18:29.482 --> 18:32.751
Oy, that crew is doing
a lot of damage to this diner.

18:32.752 --> 18:36.655
Well, I'm doing some damage
to this fancy French water.

18:36.656 --> 18:40.359
150 for the floor,
20 for the napkins they used,

18:40.360 --> 18:41.598
and...

18:45.599 --> 18:49.835
And 55 bucks for that
gorgeous picture of the city.

18:50.536 --> 18:51.971
This is ridiculous.

18:52.472 --> 18:54.740
How much longer do I have
to wait to be discovered?

18:54.741 --> 18:56.775
Do what every other
American would do--

18:56.776 --> 18:59.745
skip the hard work
and put out a sex tape.

18:59.746 --> 19:02.982
No, I'm gonna go out there.
Where's my lipstick?

19:02.983 --> 19:06.252
Here, hold my Shake Weight.

19:06.253 --> 19:08.721
And my Fresca.

19:09.789 --> 19:11.824
Oh, hi.

19:11.825 --> 19:14.894
Who do I talk to about
getting a part in this thing?

19:14.895 --> 19:17.363
I mean, I already let the guy
who puts out the cookies

19:17.364 --> 19:19.532
touch my boobs.

19:19.533 --> 19:21.066
We don't have a guy
who puts out cookies.

19:21.067 --> 19:22.801
Yo.

19:22.802 --> 19:25.671
Okay, everybody ready!
Camera up!

19:25.672 --> 19:27.673
Oh, he looks important.

19:27.674 --> 19:29.041
- Oh, no, no! Stop, stop!
- No! Let go!

19:29.042 --> 19:30.509
- Ooh!
- Not the blood switch!

19:33.246 --> 19:35.881
Ahhh!

19:35.882 --> 19:39.418
Someone shot Max!

19:39.419 --> 19:42.421
Cut!
Tom, get rid of Max too.

19:42.422 --> 19:44.123
Get me another girl.

19:44.124 --> 19:45.691
Typical!

19:45.692 --> 19:49.261
Shoot on my chest
and you're done with me.

19:51.197 --> 19:55.668
Hi, you looking
for a new girl?

19:58.138 --> 19:59.471
Last time I looked
like this,

19:59.472 --> 20:00.739
I was coming out
of an acid trip

20:00.740 --> 20:04.109
and my friend Daniel
was missing.

20:04.110 --> 20:05.477
I gotta admit,

20:05.478 --> 20:08.147
getting shot felt
kinda gangsta waitress.

20:08.148 --> 20:11.116
I'm like Notorious BLT.

20:11.817 --> 20:13.085
So here's the deal.

20:13.086 --> 20:14.286
We'll pay you
for the day yesterday,

20:14.287 --> 20:16.922
but not for today
or for the featured extra.

20:16.923 --> 20:19.625
- Say what?
- Not so fast, my brother.

20:19.626 --> 20:22.494
Here is the latest tally
for my diner damage.

20:22.495 --> 20:24.797
What's this last
$1,000 charge?

20:24.798 --> 20:27.333
That is for the damage
done to Max and Caroline.

20:27.334 --> 20:29.034
According
to crew scuttlebutt,

20:29.035 --> 20:31.604
the director tried
some funny business last night.

20:31.605 --> 20:32.871
This is not cool, dude.

20:32.872 --> 20:35.574
It is most decidedly
not cool, pal.

20:35.575 --> 20:38.410
So maybe there is someone
in a union I can talk to

20:38.411 --> 20:40.279
about this particular
damage.

20:40.280 --> 20:42.581
Not to mention the child
labor laws you violated

20:42.582 --> 20:44.950
by working with Han.

20:44.951 --> 20:47.486
Don't talk to anyone.
I'll get 'em paid.

20:47.487 --> 20:49.188
This sucks.

20:49.189 --> 20:50.923
I knew we should've
shot at a Denny's.

20:52.559 --> 20:54.727
Han, that is the sweetest,
coolest thing

20:54.728 --> 20:56.395
you just did for us.

20:56.396 --> 20:59.264
It is, and Caroline is totally
gonna put out for you tonight.

20:59.265 --> 21:01.000
That's kind of her thing now.

21:01.001 --> 21:04.236
Well, I don't want anyone
to take advantage of you two.

21:04.237 --> 21:05.804
You're my girls.

21:05.805 --> 21:09.274
And tonight, on a very special
episode of <i>Funk and Skank,</i>

21:09.275 --> 21:12.044
the cute, tiny Asian guy
turns out to be the girls' pimp,

21:12.045 --> 21:15.447
and the copstitutes
are able to buy new horseshoes.
