05:36.078 --> 05:38.078
Now?
You're just asking this now?

05:38.172 --> 05:40.188
It's an archetypal story
about Odette,

05:40.190 --> 05:42.082

an evil wizard named Rothbart,

05:42.234 --> 05:43.991
who turns her
into a swan by day.

05:44.127 --> 05:45.010

once someone
swears true love to her.

So it's like<i> Shrek</i>
only not funny?

05:49.165 --> 05:50.907

the most important issue

05:51.000 --> 05:53.093
is, how do we
commemorate Paula?

05:53.245 --> 05:54.094
We minimize her.

05:54.262 --> 05:56.337
Wh--she was a huge part
of the show.

05:56.464 --> 05:58.339
-What does that even mean?
-We have to do something.

05:58.359 --> 06:00.192

shows to be sad about someone

06:00.419 --> 06:02.009

06:03.864 --> 06:06.439
and finally found love but died
of cancer way too young,

06:06.592 --> 06:09.534
because that is a reminder
that life is crushingly unfair,

06:09.611 --> 06:12.746
which is exactly, exactly what
people tune into these shows

06:12.897 --> 06:14.280

25:55.112 --> 25:58.371
There's been an incident
at school.

25:58.391 --> 26:00.799
Uh, it is...

26:00.951 --> 26:03.376
quite striking.

26:03.396 --> 26:05.137
I would characterize it as art.

26:05.231 --> 26:06.897
I would characterize it
as vandalism!

26:07.049 --> 26:08.457
Oh, of course
that's how you'd see it.

26:08.459 --> 26:10.050
Sweetheart, you're just making
things worse, so I would--

26:10.144 --> 26:11.885
This is a protest against
the school's sexist

26:13.314 --> 26:15.814

flying out of the womb?

Yes, honey, we all see
the angel

26:18.135 --> 26:19.468

Yes, I am, but your sister
painted a giant vagina

41:32.139 --> 41:33.639
-(clears throat)
-Oh, you're kidding me.

41:33.658 --> 41:35.383
Jessica said there was a huge
accident on the highway,

41:35.401 --> 41:37.218
and it looks like Reggie's
not gonna get here on time.

41:37.237 --> 41:39.144
Text her back, tell her to do
whatever she has to.

41:39.164 --> 41:40.571
-Get him here.
-Yeah, I'll do it.

41:40.665 --> 41:41.814
You hear me?

41:41.833 --> 41:43.148
Yes, I hear you,
loud and clear.

41:43.243 --> 41:45.502
Oh, my God.
(sighs)

41:45.670 --> 41:47.319
Thank you, honey.

41:47.339 --> 41:50.173
Here we are.
Do you hear them out there?

41:50.324 --> 41:52.917
After all those months
of hard work,

41:52.994 --> 41:54.902
we have an audience.

41:54.996 --> 41:56.662
(cheers and applause)

41:56.756 --> 41:59.665
Now, I know you are nervous.
I most certainly am.

41:59.684 --> 42:04.521
But I hope that you are proud
of yourselves...

42:04.672 --> 42:07.524
proud of the accomplishments
you have made,

42:07.675 --> 42:10.193
the friendships
you have forged,

42:10.344 --> 42:14.013
the moments of beauty...

42:14.107 --> 42:17.108
you've created and shared...

42:17.202 --> 42:19.536
the losses and triumphs
you have experienced

42:19.763 --> 42:21.454
along the way.

42:23.099 --> 42:25.858
Dancers, get excited!

42:25.877 --> 42:28.936
(cheers and applause)

42:29.030 --> 42:31.330
<i> Tonight is your night!</i>

42:31.441 --> 42:32.882
No.

42:33.034 --> 42:35.793
And I would like to dedicate
this performance

42:35.887 --> 42:38.704
to our dear Paula.

42:38.723 --> 42:40.615
Paula, this one is for you.

42:40.633 --> 42:42.392
ALL: For Paula.

42:42.543 --> 42:43.726
Nice.
(sighs)

42:43.878 --> 42:45.286
(electricity crackles)

42:45.305 --> 42:46.545
Oh, God.
What now?

42:46.565 --> 42:48.472
(electricity crackles)

42:48.567 --> 42:51.401
WAYNE: Everyone, stay calm.
It's fine. It's fine.

42:51.552 --> 42:52.977
Babe?

42:53.129 --> 42:54.979
I thought you wanted me
to do the show?

42:55.073 --> 42:56.314
Guys, I lost picture.
Talk to me.

42:56.390 --> 42:57.465
Dad, what's happening?

42:57.576 --> 42:58.741
We're ten minutes to curtain.
Where's my power?

42:58.968 --> 42:59.817
We're trying
to locate the problem.

42:59.953 --> 43:01.226
Well, let's locate faster,
please.

43:01.395 --> 43:02.412
Street's still lit.
It's probably not a grid issue.

43:02.639 --> 43:03.821
Really? You need to get
a special license

43:03.973 --> 43:04.897
to figure that out?

43:04.916 --> 43:06.082
Come on, I need the power back.

43:06.233 --> 43:07.917
I've found that sarcasm
isn't really helpful

43:08.069 --> 43:09.902
-in times of crisis.
-(breathing heavily)

43:09.921 --> 43:11.646
Dad, you okay?

43:11.664 --> 43:13.423
-Uh-huh.
-Dad...

43:13.592 --> 43:16.467
