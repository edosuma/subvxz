WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:07.925
Good morning.

00:08.008 --> 00:10.928
Oh, I'm starving.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.846
What's for breakfast, bitch?

00:12.930 --> 00:15.641
Ooh, you look rough in the morning.

00:18.685 --> 00:20.145
- Ah.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.571
Babe, I had the weirdest dream.

00:29.655 --> 00:31.615
- Huh?

00:31.698 --> 00:33.700
- Yeah, I was, like...

00:52.970 --> 00:54.763
- Hey, babe?

00:54.847 --> 00:57.182
- Hmm?
- What you up to today?

00:57.266 --> 00:58.600
- Nothing.

00:58.684 --> 01:00.769
- Want to come to my ADR session?

01:09.069 --> 01:11.154
- All right. That's a wrap.

01:11.238 --> 01:12.990
I think we're all set here.
- Sounds good, Jason.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.658
I'll get the stems uploaded

01:14.741 --> 01:17.160
to the FTP and ship 'em off to Editorial.

01:17.244 --> 01:19.371
- Rick and Morty is literally my religion.

01:19.454 --> 01:21.290
I wanted to do a voice since season one,

01:21.373 --> 01:23.292
and my agents were all like,
"Oh, but we got you

01:23.375 --> 01:25.419
this part as this hot girl,
and she doesn't know it."

01:25.502 --> 01:26.837
Who needs that?

01:26.920 --> 01:29.381
Oh, and I have to say, that apology

01:29.464 --> 01:32.593
you gave about crossing romantic
boundaries in the workplace?

01:32.676 --> 01:34.636
So beautiful.
- Thank you.

01:34.720 --> 01:36.972
- Um, I actually talked about it
on my podcast.

01:37.055 --> 01:40.184
I, uh, have a podcast
about, uh, Jungian archetypes

01:40.267 --> 01:41.894
in the world of cosplay.

01:41.977 --> 01:44.188
Oh, uh, could I grab a hot water
with some lemon?

01:44.271 --> 01:45.898
You made me scream so loud
on that last take.

01:45.981 --> 01:47.107
- Oh, no, this is my girlfriend Cody.

01:47.191 --> 01:48.442
- Hi.

01:48.525 --> 01:50.235
- Oh, my God. Hi!
- Hi. So nice to meet you.

01:50.319 --> 01:52.237
- Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
- No, not at all. It's fine.

01:52.321 --> 01:53.572
I can...
- Forget I said anything.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.115
- Cody's a writer, too.
- Oh, wow!

01:55.199 --> 01:56.909
- No, not like Dan.
- Oh, two legends at work?

01:56.992 --> 02:00.579
Is that what that is?
- No. No. Um, I can
get you the water, um...

02:00.662 --> 02:02.581
- No, no, no. Please.
- I'm happy to do it.
- What are you doing?

02:02.664 --> 02:04.416
- It's totally fine.
- I can get the...
- Tell her to stop. No.

02:28.941 --> 02:29.942
- Bean?

02:30.025 --> 02:31.944
- Huh?

02:32.027 --> 02:32.945
- You okay? What happened?

02:33.028 --> 02:34.321
You've been gone for, like, ten minutes.

02:34.404 --> 02:36.198
- Oh, shit. Yeah, I'll just

02:36.281 --> 02:37.199
bring it to her right now.

02:37.282 --> 02:38.325
- Oh, no, she left already.

02:38.408 --> 02:40.118
- Oh.

02:40.202 --> 02:42.079
- You bummed you couldn't valet her car?
- Shut up.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.580
- I bet you she has some dry-cleaning

02:43.664 --> 02:45.207
she'd like you to pick up.
- Don't.

02:45.290 --> 02:48.168
Stop.
I was just trying to be nice.

02:48.252 --> 02:49.545
- Are you okay?

02:51.171 --> 02:52.923
- Yeah, um, you know, I think

02:53.006 --> 02:54.925
I left my, um,
computer charger at your house.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.760
Is it cool if I go grab it?

02:56.844 --> 02:58.929
- Oh, yeah. I, um...

02:59.012 --> 03:00.639
I have a spare key.

03:00.722 --> 03:03.100
- Okay, cool. I'll just...

03:47.186 --> 03:48.478
- Psych!

03:48.562 --> 03:50.480
- Oh, what the fuck?!

03:50.564 --> 03:52.774
Fuck, man! Shit!

03:52.858 --> 03:54.151
- I knew you were gonna
come back here, being like,

03:54.234 --> 03:55.694
"Was that a dream?
Was that drugs?"

03:55.777 --> 03:57.154
I was like, "I'm gonna prank this bitch."

03:57.237 --> 03:58.822
Did you see me? I was like...

03:58.906 --> 04:01.033
- Stop. Stop!
That freaks me out!

04:02.784 --> 04:05.913
- Oh, my God.
Your face is so stupid.

04:05.996 --> 04:07.289
- You suck, dude.
- You suck.

04:07.372 --> 04:08.874
- You suck.
- You suck.

04:08.957 --> 04:10.667
You ready to do this?

04:10.751 --> 04:12.503
- What?

04:12.586 --> 04:14.838
- My pussy.
I've got, like, years' worth

04:14.922 --> 04:16.381
of Dan's pole milk
congealed up in there.

04:16.465 --> 04:18.133
- Okay. Okay.

04:18.217 --> 04:19.510
Okay.

04:19.593 --> 04:20.928
This isn't real.

04:21.011 --> 04:22.554
You're not real.

04:22.638 --> 04:23.555
- I'm real.

04:23.639 --> 04:25.474
- But...

04:25.557 --> 04:27.434
the yeast infection
I could get is real,

04:27.518 --> 04:31.063
so I'm just gonna... do this.

04:31.146 --> 04:32.689
- Oh, I love baths!

04:32.773 --> 04:34.733
I love how at first,
it feels like they're so hot,

04:34.816 --> 04:36.109
and you're like, "I'm gonna fucking die.

04:36.193 --> 04:37.736
It's like my skin's gonna crawl off."

04:37.819 --> 04:40.280
And then it gets kind of cold
and it's just heaven.

04:42.115 --> 04:45.661
Oh, it's 'cause
you saw my perfect body, huh?

04:45.744 --> 04:47.371
- What?

04:47.454 --> 04:50.040
- Why you're in such a bad mood.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.042
- No. No.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.794
- Is it because you're scared
Dan's gonna cheat on you

04:53.877 --> 04:56.213
with the redheaded actress
from that nerdy podcast

04:56.296 --> 04:58.257
who's like a way less hot version of me?

04:58.340 --> 05:02.135
- No. Barbara, I'm in a bad mood,

05:02.219 --> 05:04.513
because I'm having
a fucking nervous breakdown.

05:04.596 --> 05:06.515
My boyfriend's sex doll is talking to me.

05:06.598 --> 05:08.183
- Okay. I don't know if you're trying

05:08.267 --> 05:10.143
to diminish my self-worth
by calling me a sex doll,

05:10.227 --> 05:11.812
but I have news for you, babe.

05:11.895 --> 05:14.356
We're all sex dolls
until we topple the patriarchy.

05:14.439 --> 05:16.817
- Great. That's great.
You're a feminist sex doll.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.569
- Yeah. I am. Yeah.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.237
I've read The Feminine Mystique, so, yeah.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.531
- No, see, no, you haven't.

05:22.614 --> 05:24.116
You're just me.

05:24.199 --> 05:25.826
You're not your own person.

05:25.909 --> 05:27.244
And I haven't read The Feminine Mystique.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.620
I just pretend that I've read it

05:28.704 --> 05:30.205
when it comes up in conversation.

05:30.289 --> 05:32.499
So you can't have read it.
- I have read it.

05:32.583 --> 05:34.585
- Tell me one thing about it.
Tell me one thing.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.003
- You know what, Cody?
I'm not gonna sit here

05:36.086 --> 05:38.380
in a bath in my peaceful time for me

05:38.463 --> 05:40.507
and justify myself
to a crazy person, okay?

05:40.591 --> 05:42.259
I mean, you've got a dark cloud energy.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.636
Oh, my God, is it Dan?
- No, it's my agent.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.430
- He's, like, a real estate agent?

05:46.513 --> 05:48.265
- Hello.
- Hi, Cody.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.934
I have Jason Levy for you.
- Who?

05:51.018 --> 05:53.270
- Hey, Cody, I'm Jason.
I'm your new agent.

05:53.353 --> 05:54.938
- Okay. What are you...?

05:55.022 --> 05:56.481
- Yeah, I don't know if you heard or not,

05:56.565 --> 05:57.983
but, uh, Bryan Chang got MeToo'd.

05:58.066 --> 05:59.443
He's no longer with the company.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.904
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

06:01.987 --> 06:03.947
So I've taken over his roster,
the whole roster,

06:04.031 --> 06:05.407
and, uh, it looks like you owe us

06:05.490 --> 06:07.618
a new spec pilot for staffing season?

06:07.701 --> 06:09.620
- Oh, yeah.
I'm... I'm... working on...

06:09.703 --> 06:10.996
I'm kind of halfway through...

06:11.079 --> 06:12.414
more than halfway through this thing.

06:12.497 --> 06:14.249
It's, like, you know,

06:14.333 --> 06:16.585
the-the tooth fairy,
but she's also a stripper.

06:16.668 --> 06:18.670
You know, because both jobs, like...

06:18.754 --> 06:20.297
'Cause dollar bills.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.840
- You know, honestly, uh,

06:21.924 --> 06:23.300
you're a female writer.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.093
It doesn't have to be that good.

06:25.177 --> 06:26.970
- Really?
- Oh, not at all.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.889
- Not sure how to feel about that.

06:28.972 --> 06:30.641
- Ah, feelings are good.
Put those in there.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.434
We need more female voices.

06:32.518 --> 06:34.144
- Okay.
- I can't wait to read it.

06:34.228 --> 06:35.479
Oh, sorry. Bad connection. Bye.

06:39.650 --> 06:41.818
- Oh, my God.

06:41.902 --> 06:44.112
- Oh, my God.
Your agent was MeToo'd?

06:44.196 --> 06:46.114
- Yeah. Shit.

06:46.198 --> 06:48.408
- Babe, I'm so sorry. That's crazy.
- Right?

06:48.492 --> 06:50.577
- Oh, my God.
You want to talk about it?

06:50.661 --> 06:52.955
You were probably, like, harassed, right?

06:53.038 --> 06:54.414
- No. No.

06:54.498 --> 06:56.583
- Wait. What?
I'm just confused,

06:56.667 --> 06:59.336
'cause I thought you said
that he was MeToo'd.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.672
Did he, like, whip his dick out
at you ever?

07:03.090 --> 07:05.300
- No. I mean, thank God, no.

07:05.384 --> 07:07.302
- So he didn't, like,
call you late at night

07:07.386 --> 07:10.264
and say it was for work, but
really was just trying to bone?

07:10.347 --> 07:12.850
- No, but I'm-I'm... I mean,
I'm sure that's 'cause he, like,

07:12.933 --> 07:14.601
respected me too much
as a writer to do...

07:14.685 --> 07:17.980
- I'm sorry.
I'm really not trying to laugh,

07:18.063 --> 07:19.606
but, like, it's funny,
'cause, like, obviously,

07:19.690 --> 07:22.734
he didn't respect you
as a writer or want to fuck you.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.780
- Is your pussy clean yet?
Can we...? Come on.

07:26.864 --> 07:28.740
- So, you're a comedy writer.

07:28.824 --> 07:30.659
So cool.

07:30.742 --> 07:32.703
It's just, you haven't made me laugh.

07:32.786 --> 07:36.331
- Well, wasn't trying to.
- Well, I'm waiting.

07:36.415 --> 07:38.333
Oh, Cody, I forgot to tell you.

07:38.417 --> 07:40.127
I'm not just a regular sex doll.

07:40.210 --> 07:41.795
I'm actually a special order.

07:41.879 --> 07:43.297
- That's great, Barbara.

07:43.380 --> 07:45.048
- I know. It's so sweet.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.967
Dan designed me from top to bottom.

07:47.050 --> 07:49.761
I'm, like, his ideal woman.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.391
- I make Dan laugh.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.393
- I'm sorry. What?

07:56.476 --> 07:58.103
- I said, I make Dan laugh.

07:58.187 --> 08:00.397
- You do? When?
I never hear him laughing.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.191
- I hear you laughing.

08:02.274 --> 08:04.067
And I guess sometimes I hear, like,

08:04.151 --> 08:05.903
incidental laughter on his part?

08:05.986 --> 08:08.155
But then that... No, that was
always kind of connected back

08:08.238 --> 08:09.823
to whatever his original joke was.

08:09.907 --> 08:11.742
You know what, Cody?
Don't feel bad.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.411
Like, I just do not expect you
to be as funny as Dan.

08:14.494 --> 08:15.954
Like, he's Dan Harmon.

08:16.038 --> 08:17.956
He's won Emmys and created two hit shows.

08:18.040 --> 08:21.001
You know who else is super funny?
His ex-wife.

08:21.084 --> 08:22.961
Back then, I used to live in the basement,

08:23.045 --> 08:26.715
and I swear to God, she was so funny.

08:26.798 --> 08:29.635
Like, I would be like,
"Guys, stop laughing so hard!

08:29.718 --> 08:31.053
I can't sleep!"

08:31.136 --> 08:33.347
They'd be, like, howling.

08:33.430 --> 08:34.681
- Okay, great. Bye!

08:34.765 --> 08:37.226
- Wait! Wait!

08:37.309 --> 08:39.603
Babe? Oh, my God, you're stupid.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.647
This isn't how I was positioned.

08:41.730 --> 08:43.065
- So?

08:43.148 --> 08:44.816
- So, Dan's gonna know you snooped,

08:44.900 --> 08:46.318
and then he's gonna think
you're a crazy bitch,

08:46.401 --> 08:47.903
and then he's gonna break up with you.

08:47.986 --> 08:51.073
- Okay. Fine. How were you?

08:51.156 --> 08:52.699
- My right arm was higher.

08:52.783 --> 08:54.117
Because I had
just finished running my hands

08:54.201 --> 08:56.370
through my beautiful hair.
No, higher.

08:56.453 --> 08:58.247
- Why are you so hard to move?

08:58.330 --> 09:00.290
- Pull harder.
Why are you so weak?

09:00.374 --> 09:02.125
Harder!
- I'm trying. God.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.460
- Oh, we get...

09:04.545 --> 09:06.004
- Fuck, shit!

09:06.088 --> 09:07.548
- It hurts!

09:07.631 --> 09:09.091
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

09:09.174 --> 09:10.926
- Is my arm there? Is it there?
