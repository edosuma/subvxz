WEBVTT

00:01.894 --> 00:03.818
Okay, so you remember
last night at the cat funeral?

00:03.912 --> 00:05.653
I was mad at Oscar because
he said that Mr. Meowskers was

00:05.673 --> 00:07.564
"just a cat," but, of course,
Max handled it perfectly.

00:07.583 --> 00:09.657
But then Oscar saved the day
because he drove to Chicago

00:09.752 --> 00:11.735
to get the cat's ashes, and then
Max said he wanted to kiss me.

00:11.754 --> 00:12.586
Wait, what?!

00:12.680 --> 00:13.995
Yes, Max!

00:14.015 --> 00:15.906
Max! Max! Max! Ma-ax!

00:15.999 --> 00:17.516
Okay, okay, I'm all Maxed out.

00:17.743 --> 00:19.834
Sorry, I was up all night.
I'm hopped up on coffee.

00:19.928 --> 00:21.503
-Are you done with this?
-I just got it.

00:21.597 --> 00:23.063
All right, come again.

00:24.933 --> 00:27.342
My heart's going a mile
a minute, I need to slow down.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.527
Do you want me to slap you?

00:28.678 --> 00:30.103
No, 'cause you never take
your rings off.

00:30.256 --> 00:32.013
How could he do that to you?

00:32.033 --> 00:33.681
Who did what to who?

00:33.776 --> 00:35.534
Max told Kat that he wanted
to kiss her last night.

00:35.761 --> 00:37.185
(gasps)
How romantic.

00:37.204 --> 00:38.203
No, it's not!

00:38.430 --> 00:40.097
But she's liked Max forever.

00:40.115 --> 00:41.206
But she has a boyfriend.

00:41.358 --> 00:42.449
And Oscar is wonderful.

00:42.601 --> 00:45.452
Yeah, but Max wears
those tight jeans.

00:45.546 --> 00:47.621
Well, Oscar has
those delivery man calves.

00:47.715 --> 00:50.791
Okay, stop! You sound
like the inside of my head.

00:50.943 --> 00:52.367
Look at you, Kat.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.461
Two pigs nosing
around your trough.

00:54.555 --> 00:57.205
I know, I'm not used
to having such a busy trough!

00:57.892 --> 00:59.633
Well, I say love
the one you're with.

00:59.785 --> 01:01.042
Please don't start singing.

01:01.062 --> 01:03.287
What I have with Oscar is real.

01:03.380 --> 01:06.047
You know, Max has been
the dream for so long.

01:06.067 --> 01:08.692
I say go with the dream.

01:10.071 --> 01:11.144
I'm sorry, I don't like to

01:11.297 --> 01:12.071
get involved in
other people's business,

01:12.298 --> 01:13.146
but I'm a big believer

01:13.299 --> 01:14.798
in dream-following.

01:14.891 --> 01:16.316
He loves to get
into other people's business.

01:16.468 --> 01:18.059
Oh, my gosh.
You look just like--

01:18.153 --> 01:18.985
Wait, are you...?

01:19.080 --> 01:20.728
-I'm not.
-He is.

01:20.823 --> 01:21.822
And you're...

01:21.974 --> 01:23.640
-She's not.
-I am.

01:23.733 --> 01:25.309
(screams)

01:25.402 --> 01:27.068
Okay, wait,
what's going on over here?

01:27.088 --> 01:29.663
These two were on my favorite
TV show when I was growing up!

01:29.815 --> 01:31.090
I was on it, I was on it, too.

01:31.317 --> 01:33.483
-I was on the show.
-Oh, which episode?

01:33.577 --> 01:34.668
All of them.

01:34.762 --> 01:36.153
I was, I was the older brother.

01:36.246 --> 01:38.079
Yeah, I'm not remembering that.

01:38.099 --> 01:39.581
Oh, no, I get it, you know?
She talked real fast.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.934
He was an idiot.
I was just a boring, old,

01:42.161 --> 01:44.252
heartfelt, three-dimensional
character, whatever.

01:44.346 --> 01:46.346
Joey, I was so obsessed

01:46.498 --> 01:48.348
with you. I had posters
of you all over my room.

01:48.442 --> 01:49.850
There was one where
you were going like this.

01:49.944 --> 01:51.501
I had that on the ceiling
right over my bed.

01:51.520 --> 01:53.595
Wow, that's flattering.
(laughs)

01:53.614 --> 01:56.431
-And disturbing.
-What are y'all doing
in Louisville?

01:56.525 --> 01:58.450
Oh, we're here for a celebrity
charity golf tournament.

01:58.602 --> 02:00.844
You know, it's our way to give
back, be part of the solution.

02:00.863 --> 02:03.438
Plus I get balls
with my face on them.

02:04.441 --> 02:06.608
Is Matthew McConaughey
gonna be there?

02:06.627 --> 02:07.626
I don't know.

02:07.777 --> 02:09.536
Well, if-if he is,
would you tell him

02:09.630 --> 02:11.855
that Phil Crumpler is very sorry

02:11.874 --> 02:13.540
about what happened at the 1996

02:13.692 --> 02:15.175
Tennessee State Fair?

02:15.285 --> 02:17.469
First thing I'll mention
when I see him.

02:18.530 --> 02:20.714
Any chance you'd do the dance
with me? I know it by heart.

02:20.866 --> 02:23.791
Oh, I only dance for money.
Wait, that came out wrong.

02:23.811 --> 02:26.145
No, what I'm trying
to say is-is I only do it

02:26.372 --> 02:28.054
if I'm getting paid. Damn it.

02:28.874 --> 02:30.649
Why don't I take a picture
of all of you together?

02:30.876 --> 02:32.484
-Oh, yeah, yeah!
-Oh, a picture...

02:32.711 --> 02:33.986
uh, okay, okay, here.

02:34.137 --> 02:35.379
Use my phone, though,
it's auto-set

02:35.397 --> 02:36.655
to accentuate my cheekbones.

02:36.882 --> 02:38.139
Ooh, I'm gonna have
Joey Lawrence's number

02:38.233 --> 02:39.383
when he sends it to me.

02:39.476 --> 02:40.975
That's okay,
you can use your phone.

02:41.069 --> 02:42.310
KAT:
Okay.

02:42.329 --> 02:43.978
-All right, here we go.
-Um, wait, no, uh,

02:44.072 --> 02:45.572
-wait, I want
to be next to Joey.
-Okay, oh!

02:45.724 --> 02:48.892
I'm gonna get cropped
right out of this thing.

02:48.985 --> 02:50.227
All right, one, two, three.

02:50.320 --> 02:51.578
(laughter, clamoring)

02:51.672 --> 02:54.173
Um, so whatever happened
to the girl with the flower hat?

02:54.324 --> 02:56.425
I heard she was hosting
quiz shows.

02:57.920 --> 02:59.236
Well, it doesn't matter.

02:59.254 --> 03:00.345
The show was really
just a vehicle for you.

03:00.497 --> 03:01.680
You know,
I always felt that way.

03:01.907 --> 03:03.515
I got to tell you something,
though, it's very nice

03:03.667 --> 03:06.852
to hear it from, uh,
regular people.

03:07.003 --> 03:08.745
Can I get you
free refills on the house?

03:08.838 --> 03:11.356
-They're always on the house.
-Just let her have this.

03:11.508 --> 03:13.767
-Coffee coming right up.
-Oh, hey!

03:13.919 --> 03:15.343
-She knows the dance.
-How about that!

03:15.362 --> 03:16.695
JOEY: Whoa, look at that,
she knows the whole dance!

03:16.846 --> 03:17.529
Oh, my goodness.

03:17.756 --> 03:19.847
Hey, wow.
(whooping)

03:19.867 --> 03:21.107
Pet some cats, you said.

03:21.260 --> 03:22.701
It'll be relaxing, you said.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.520
♪<i> Me, oh, my, oh, my, oh, me</i> ♪

03:25.539 --> 03:27.372
♪<i> Nothin' wrong with you</i>
<i> but I'd rather be me.</i> ♪

03:27.599 --> 03:29.282
This trash bag

03:29.435 --> 03:31.101
is overflowing like an outhouse

03:31.194 --> 03:33.545
in a rainstorm.

03:33.697 --> 03:34.713
Not it.

03:34.864 --> 03:36.381
Yes, you is "it."

03:36.533 --> 03:39.109
I had to take the trash out
four times last week

03:39.127 --> 03:40.535
because you kept disappearing.

03:40.629 --> 03:42.429
Where you been going anyway?

03:50.547 --> 03:52.731
It don't matter
where I be going.

03:52.882 --> 03:54.474
I'll take it out.

03:54.626 --> 03:55.234
Really?

03:55.385 --> 03:56.735
Sure, I finished my coffee

03:56.886 --> 03:58.052
and if I go home now,

03:58.146 --> 03:59.220
it's just me and the emptiness

03:59.240 --> 04:01.365
of my declining years.

04:04.319 --> 04:06.578
Look who I found
with two paws in the catio

04:06.730 --> 04:08.305
and two paws on the sidewalk?

04:08.398 --> 04:10.082
Today is not the day
for hijinks.

04:10.309 --> 04:12.142
Sorry, Hijinks,
not talking to you.

04:12.160 --> 04:13.643
Houdini chewed
through the screen again?

04:13.737 --> 04:16.070
Yes. We need to keep
the catio doors closed

04:16.090 --> 04:17.481
until he is adopted.

04:17.499 --> 04:19.258
I mean, where are you going
that's better than here?

04:19.409 --> 04:20.908
When I found you,
you were eating scraps

04:20.928 --> 04:22.261
at the back of a Hooters.

04:22.412 --> 04:24.596
And if that's
not hitting bottom, what is?

04:25.582 --> 04:27.432
(phone ringing)

04:27.584 --> 04:28.767
Oh, shoot, it's Oscar.

04:28.994 --> 04:30.010
What if he knows something's up?

04:30.162 --> 04:31.495
Don't answer.

04:31.588 --> 04:32.587
Well, then he'll really
know something's up,

04:32.681 --> 04:34.564
I love to answer the phone!

04:35.592 --> 04:37.183
Hi, boyfriend of mine.

04:37.278 --> 04:39.444
My boo-thang, my booger-bear.

04:39.671 --> 04:41.113
I thought we were gonna vet
nicknames

04:41.264 --> 04:42.689
before we put 'em
in the rotation.

04:42.841 --> 04:45.025
Yeah, sorry, I don't know what
I'm saying, too much coffee.

04:45.177 --> 04:46.676
And a personal romantic crisis

04:46.695 --> 04:48.512
for which there is no precedent.

04:48.530 --> 04:50.514
I just found out
there's a meteor shower tonight.

04:50.532 --> 04:52.541
And I thought maybe we could
watch it on your roof.

04:54.110 --> 04:55.943
<i> -Hello?</i>
-Um...

04:55.963 --> 04:57.945
<i> -Kat?</i>
-Yeah.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.798
I'm here, I'm here, uh...

05:00.025 --> 05:01.858
that sounds really fun, yeah.

05:01.877 --> 05:02.859
I'll, uh...

05:02.952 --> 05:05.045
I'll meteor you up there.

05:05.139 --> 05:06.880
I'll see you tonight,
booger-bear.

05:07.032 --> 05:08.473
Nope, still weird.

05:08.700 --> 05:11.343
Hey, Kat, what muffin
do you want tomorrow?

05:11.495 --> 05:13.720
-Blueberry or lemon poppyseed?
-I don't know!

05:13.872 --> 05:16.389
How many decisions do I have
to make in one day?!

05:16.483 --> 05:17.891
Wait, what are you
over here yelling about?

05:18.043 --> 05:19.526
You're scaring the customers
and the cats.

05:19.711 --> 05:21.969
I'm sorry, just this
whole Oscar-Max situation's

05:21.989 --> 05:23.213
got me "kerfuffled."

05:23.231 --> 05:24.806
Why don't you
just take the day off?

05:24.900 --> 05:26.158
Why don't you take the day off?!

05:26.385 --> 05:27.734
You know what, I think
I should take the day off.

05:28.812 --> 05:31.163
Yeah, uh, Randi and I can
handle the café.

05:31.314 --> 05:32.497
Okay, thank you. Here's the list

05:32.649 --> 05:33.981
of what I wanted
to get done today and,

05:34.001 --> 05:35.316
and tell the cats I'm sorry.

05:35.336 --> 05:37.243
And Mommy's not mad at them.

05:37.338 --> 05:39.171
Ew!

05:39.322 --> 05:41.231
She really does handle all
the gross stuff.

05:41.249 --> 05:44.176
I don't even know
what the "furry finger test" is.

05:44.327 --> 05:46.261
Anything else I can do?

05:47.330 --> 05:48.213
You sure?

05:48.365 --> 05:50.407
Yeah. I retired early.

05:50.425 --> 05:53.093
Huge mistake.
Taking out that trash

05:53.187 --> 05:55.912
was the most rewarding thing
I've done all week.

05:57.006 --> 06:00.433
Well, I suppose we could find
a few more things for you to do.

06:00.527 --> 06:02.176
I'll get right on it.

06:02.196 --> 06:03.511
Ooh, the shake and sniff!

06:03.530 --> 06:06.013
I can't wait to find out
what that is!

06:06.033 --> 06:07.774
(whoops)
I feel naughty.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.350
Like when I used to put on

06:09.370 --> 06:12.496
one of Mama's cocktail dresses
and smoke.

06:14.208 --> 06:16.041
So you just walked up to her

06:16.192 --> 06:18.377
at her cat's funeral and said,
"I want to kiss you"?

06:18.528 --> 06:21.938
I did, I wanted to say it,
and I said it.

06:21.957 --> 06:23.106
And?

06:23.125 --> 06:24.457
Nothing.

06:24.610 --> 06:26.793
And then she avoided me
the whole rest of the party.

06:26.887 --> 06:29.054
And then this morning was weird.

06:29.281 --> 06:31.615
You know, usually she's like...

06:31.633 --> 06:34.801
You know,
sometimes there's even a kick.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.210
But...

06:36.230 --> 06:37.954
-today she ducked.
-Mm.

06:38.047 --> 06:40.232
Or tripped.
With her it's hard to tell.

06:40.383 --> 06:42.475
And you're not used
to hearing no.

06:42.628 --> 06:44.069
Well, that's not true.

06:44.296 --> 06:45.720
Hey, would you like
another drink?

06:45.739 --> 06:46.988
I shouldn't.

06:48.300 --> 06:50.909
(chuckles)
Okay, maybe just one more.

06:51.060 --> 06:52.485
See? This is why

06:52.579 --> 06:54.471
I hired a bartender
with no experience.

06:54.564 --> 06:56.748
You know Kat has a boyfriend.

06:56.900 --> 06:58.417
Yes, I am aware of that.

06:58.644 --> 07:01.402
But we have
such an amazing connection.

07:01.496 --> 07:03.496
And why wouldn't I want
to be with somebody who...

07:03.590 --> 07:06.332
makes me laugh
and makes me feel good?

07:06.485 --> 07:08.075
-(phone dings)
-(laughs)

07:08.095 --> 07:10.503
-What was that?
-Nothing.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.172
(laughs)

07:12.324 --> 07:13.990
Who are you texting with?

07:14.083 --> 07:15.325
Jimmy the beer guy.

07:15.343 --> 07:17.494
Are you and Jimmy the beer guy
having sex?

07:17.512 --> 07:19.438
Because that's
your "I'm getting some" giggle.

07:19.665 --> 07:21.756
All right, look,
I'm gonna tell you something.

07:21.775 --> 07:24.834
But you got to swear
on the sanctity of our bromance

07:24.928 --> 07:26.695
that you won't say anything.

07:28.690 --> 07:30.006
It's Randi.

07:30.099 --> 07:31.783
Really?

07:31.893 --> 07:33.618
(both laughing)

07:33.845 --> 07:35.269
She said she would die of shame

07:35.289 --> 07:37.180
before she'd even give you
the time of day.

07:37.199 --> 07:39.607
I guess she lowered
her standards.

07:39.626 --> 07:42.002
Up top for lower standards.

07:43.464 --> 07:45.038
For the first time in my life,

07:45.132 --> 07:47.782
I have two men interested in me,
I just...

07:47.801 --> 07:49.283
I don't know who to pick.

07:49.303 --> 07:51.619
May I first say, bravo.

07:51.713 --> 07:54.121
And second,
you've come to the right place.

07:54.216 --> 07:56.049
Are either of them old money?

07:56.201 --> 07:57.476
-No.
-New money?

07:57.627 --> 08:00.103
-No.
-Any money?

08:01.039 --> 08:02.296
Mother, you know both of them.

08:02.316 --> 08:03.556
Forgive me for wanting you

08:03.650 --> 08:05.800
to be taken care of
after I'm gone.

08:05.894 --> 08:08.061
I own my own business.

08:08.213 --> 08:10.380
And it's adorable.

08:10.398 --> 08:12.657
Okay, come on,
I need real advice.

08:12.884 --> 08:14.826
Okay, fine. Um...

08:14.978 --> 08:16.720
well, maybe it's as simple as...

08:16.813 --> 08:19.055
just imagining
what your life would be like

08:19.074 --> 08:20.749
with each one of them.

08:21.818 --> 08:23.409
Hmm.

08:23.504 --> 08:25.319
Hi, honey, I'm home.

08:25.339 --> 08:28.006
I picked up the antacids
and scrunchies you asked for.

08:28.157 --> 08:30.324
And I got you a Kit Kat.

08:30.418 --> 08:31.918
Oh, I love foods

08:32.045 --> 08:34.012
with my name in them.

08:34.906 --> 08:36.598
Hi, honey, I'm home.

08:38.760 --> 08:41.427
Sorry I'm late. I stopped
a train from derailing,

08:41.522 --> 08:43.730
and saved these kittens.

08:45.100 --> 08:47.584
BOTH:
Aw!

08:47.677 --> 08:49.653
Oh, and I got you a Kit Kat.

08:50.589 --> 08:52.179
Wow, thanks.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.848
Hey, uh, what's for dinner?

08:53.942 --> 08:55.258
I was gonna make veggie burgers.

08:55.351 --> 08:57.202
I was thinking I'd fly you
to Japan for sushi.

08:57.353 --> 08:59.020
And then to France for dessert.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.264
Oh, so hard to choose.

09:01.357 --> 09:02.932
I've got two kinds of mustard.

09:02.951 --> 09:04.626
Did I mention I can fly?

09:05.528 --> 09:07.361
Hi, honey, I'm home.

09:07.381 --> 09:09.272
Damn it, Joey Lawrence,
don't make this harder

09:09.291 --> 09:10.940
than it already is.

09:10.959 --> 09:12.199
Again, I can fly.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.110
And we have reservations
in Japan in six minutes.

09:14.203 --> 09:16.263
Then I guess we should go.

09:23.121 --> 09:24.454
How do I compete with that?

09:24.472 --> 09:25.272
You don't.

09:25.381 --> 09:26.898
You want to take a selfie?

09:27.050 --> 09:28.641
I do.

09:28.735 --> 09:29.901
(camera clicks)

09:30.128 --> 09:31.719
<i> SHEILA:</i>
<i> Katharine?</i>

09:31.813 --> 09:32.962
Katharine?

09:32.981 --> 09:34.406
What were you doing?

09:34.633 --> 09:35.907
Oh, you said to imagine.

09:36.134 --> 09:37.558
Oh, I meant on your own time.

09:37.685 --> 09:39.636
That was boring for me.

09:39.729 --> 09:40.728
Well...

09:40.822 --> 09:42.472
-did it at least help?
-No!

09:42.490 --> 09:44.140
Now I'm more confused than ever.

09:44.233 --> 09:46.659
I'm sorry, honey.

09:46.753 --> 09:49.421
The universe has a sense
of humor though, doesn't it?

09:49.572 --> 09:51.423
All those years
of pining over Max,

09:51.574 --> 09:54.033
then the minute
you have a boyfriend,

09:54.185 --> 09:55.910
he's interested.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.837
Come here.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.682
Did my mother
just say something helpful?

10:06.106 --> 10:08.982
-Hey.
-Hey.

10:15.431 --> 10:16.615
Can I come in?

10:16.842 --> 10:18.450
Sure, yeah.

10:19.194 --> 10:20.285
Can I get you some water?

10:20.436 --> 10:22.362
No, I need
a clear head for this.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.697
Right. Something less strong.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.124
Uh, tea? Coffee?

10:26.275 --> 10:29.044
No more caffeine.
I'm starting to smell colors.

10:30.021 --> 10:32.047
Happy to see you.

10:33.282 --> 10:34.858
Unless I'm not happy to see you.

10:34.951 --> 10:36.376
I can't read your face.

10:36.528 --> 10:39.471
And usually it's easy to read,
it's basically a pop-up book.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.641
I need to ask you something.

10:42.792 --> 10:43.958
Okay.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.702
Shoot.

10:45.720 --> 10:47.203
Why now?

10:47.222 --> 10:49.147
Why after all this time,

10:49.298 --> 10:52.233
do you want to be with me?

10:52.969 --> 10:54.653
Uh...

10:54.880 --> 10:56.154
well, because...

10:56.381 --> 10:57.805
we are great together.

10:57.899 --> 10:59.140
We're Kat and Max.

10:59.234 --> 11:01.201
But we've always been
Kat and Max.

11:01.386 --> 11:02.719
Why now?

11:02.812 --> 11:04.721
I... (stammers)

11:04.814 --> 11:06.072
Does it matter?

11:06.224 --> 11:07.481
I mean, it wasn't that long ago

11:07.575 --> 11:09.316
that you said
you wanted to be with me.

11:09.378 --> 11:12.729
And you said that we were
better off friends.

11:12.747 --> 11:14.506
What changed?

11:14.657 --> 11:16.383
(exhales)

11:17.344 --> 11:18.510
I don't know.

11:18.737 --> 11:20.586
I guess, I guess
I just saw you with Oscar...

11:20.739 --> 11:22.329
-That's what changed!
I have a boyfriend!
-Whoa!

11:22.349 --> 11:23.998
-I have a boyfriend!
-Okay, okay...

11:24.092 --> 11:25.575
okay, but what's wrong with me

11:25.593 --> 11:26.926
not wanting to lose you?

11:27.078 --> 11:29.020
Max, I've been considering

11:29.172 --> 11:30.596
blowing up
my entire relationship

11:30.691 --> 11:33.024
with a guy who makes me
really, really happy.

11:33.176 --> 11:34.675
You know what,
I was gonna do that

11:34.769 --> 11:36.695
for a fantasy-- like, I don't
even believe you can fly!

11:36.846 --> 11:40.532
But I know that Oscar has
at least two kinds of mustard.

11:42.277 --> 11:44.093
Okay, you're doing
that thing again,

11:44.112 --> 11:45.428
where it makes sense to you,

11:45.521 --> 11:47.263
but not the person
you're talking to.

11:47.356 --> 11:48.948
You want to be with me

11:49.042 --> 11:50.934
because I'm not available.

11:50.952 --> 11:52.785
Okay, that's harsh.

11:52.879 --> 11:55.029
But I think it's true.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.215
So you're staying with Oscar?

11:57.442 --> 11:59.592
I am.

12:00.962 --> 12:02.369
Okay.

12:03.448 --> 12:05.281
I'm sorry that I made things
hard for you.

12:05.300 --> 12:08.042
Well, it's kind of
a nice change of pace.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.802
I usually do it to myself.

12:09.955 --> 12:11.730
(both laugh)

12:11.881 --> 12:12.972
Are we okay?

12:13.066 --> 12:15.716
Yeah. Yeah.

12:15.810 --> 12:17.218
Yeah, we're fine.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.812
I'm-I'm really happy
that you're happy though.

12:19.906 --> 12:21.388
Thank you.

12:21.483 --> 12:23.057
Now I'm gonna go home
and take a nap.

12:23.118 --> 12:24.317
I've been awake for 30 hours.

12:24.469 --> 12:25.635
And the paint on your walls
is starting

12:25.653 --> 12:28.246
to smell like purple--
like, bad purple.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.751
(door closes)

12:34.570 --> 12:35.569
Should we feel bad

12:35.589 --> 12:38.256
that Wyatt is
doing all of our work?

12:38.407 --> 12:40.925
You heard him--
he retired too early.

12:41.152 --> 12:42.910
If anything, we're helping him.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.320
We're good people.

12:44.339 --> 12:45.930
The best!

12:46.157 --> 12:47.991
What would you do
if you retired?

12:48.009 --> 12:49.267
From what?

12:49.418 --> 12:51.010
I don't even know what I want
to do with my life.

12:51.162 --> 12:52.771
I thought you were going
to art school.

12:52.998 --> 12:54.680
Well, yes,
but I still haven't decided

12:54.833 --> 12:57.183
what kind of art I want to do--
I mean, there's photography,

12:57.277 --> 13:00.169
painting, ceramics, sculpture...

13:00.263 --> 13:01.929
I'm sure you'll figure it out,
honey.

13:01.948 --> 13:04.431
When, Phil? When?!

13:04.451 --> 13:06.785
All right, the floor is swept,

13:07.012 --> 13:08.453
litter boxes are scooped.

13:08.604 --> 13:10.530
I had to wait
for the orange one.

13:10.624 --> 13:13.182
He sure takes his time.

13:13.276 --> 13:14.700
Anything else
before we close up?

13:14.795 --> 13:17.854
Unless you want to pick
my major, that's everything.

13:17.872 --> 13:19.539
Wait.

13:19.633 --> 13:21.707
Why is the catio door open?

13:21.802 --> 13:23.635
Oh, no, oh, no.

13:23.862 --> 13:25.470
In our haste to be lazy,
we forgot

13:25.697 --> 13:27.138
to tell him about Houdini.

13:27.365 --> 13:28.807
Well, maybe he didn't escape.

13:28.958 --> 13:29.957
Of course he escaped!

13:29.976 --> 13:32.143
His name is Houdini!

13:32.295 --> 13:34.203
Here, kitty, kitty.

13:34.222 --> 13:35.980
Houdini, we got tuna.

13:36.132 --> 13:38.558
Smelly, fishy, disgusting tuna.

13:38.652 --> 13:41.010
What are y'all doing out here?

13:41.012 --> 13:42.712
Tuna break.

13:42.730 --> 13:45.698
Nothing like canned fish
to top off the workday.

13:47.052 --> 13:48.809
Mmm.

13:48.903 --> 13:50.978
You want some?

13:50.997 --> 13:52.497
I'll join you tomorrow.

13:52.648 --> 13:55.983
I hate tuna, but I hate
being left out even more.

13:56.077 --> 13:57.168
He's not in the dumpsters!

13:57.395 --> 13:59.462
I'll check the garbage cans
out front!

14:00.081 --> 14:01.064
What was that?

14:01.082 --> 14:02.006
What was what?

14:02.233 --> 14:03.657
How you doing?

14:03.751 --> 14:06.419
I'm actually feeling pretty
good-- I had a nice, long nap.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.237
I had an apple
with some almond butter.

14:08.331 --> 14:10.239
Girl, I don't care
about naps and nut butter!

14:10.258 --> 14:11.832
I'm talking about Max and Oscar.

14:11.852 --> 14:14.077
Oh, oh, yeah, I've decided

14:14.170 --> 14:15.520
I'm staying with Oscar.

14:15.671 --> 14:17.413
We're actually gonna watch
the meteor shower later tonight.

14:17.432 --> 14:19.248
I'm glad you figured that out.

14:19.267 --> 14:21.601
You were scary today.

14:21.753 --> 14:23.086
Hey, Kat.

14:23.104 --> 14:24.845
Did you visit Max earlier?

14:24.939 --> 14:25.938
Yeah.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.181
Had a nice little chat, did ya?

14:27.200 --> 14:28.941
I think it went pretty well.

14:29.094 --> 14:30.076
Wrong! He just quit!

14:30.261 --> 14:31.369
-He quit?!
-Yeah.

14:31.520 --> 14:32.612
You owe me a bartender.

14:32.706 --> 14:35.665
Well, if you can find Wyatt,
he might do it.

14:42.790 --> 14:45.383
(groans) What, do you have
a key to the building?

14:45.534 --> 14:48.219
-(sighs) Can I come in?
-No, I'm busy.

14:48.371 --> 14:50.279
With what?
You just quit your job.

14:50.298 --> 14:52.448
Well, that news traveled fast.

14:52.541 --> 14:54.708
-I think we should talk.
-I don't want to talk.

14:54.728 --> 14:56.227
All right.

14:57.731 --> 15:01.232
-Aha! Did the same thing
with your doorman!
-Ah! Slippery.

15:01.902 --> 15:03.142
Wait.

15:03.294 --> 15:04.718
What is all this?
Where are you going?

15:04.812 --> 15:07.964
I'm gonna take off,
give us a little space.

15:07.982 --> 15:09.482
Oh, Max, don't do this.

15:09.634 --> 15:11.576
I don't want to get in the way
of you and Oscar being happy.

15:11.727 --> 15:13.578
You can tell yourself that
all you want,

15:13.729 --> 15:16.063
but when things get difficult
or uncomfortable, you bolt.

15:16.082 --> 15:18.249
-Do not.
-Oh, please, it's what you do!

15:18.401 --> 15:20.643
Get a D on a test,
you drop the class.

15:20.662 --> 15:21.920
That professor hated me.

15:22.071 --> 15:24.756
One bad gig at a nightclub
and you give up on music.

15:24.907 --> 15:26.165
People threw fruit!

15:26.317 --> 15:27.833
Where did they even get fruit?!

15:27.928 --> 15:29.427
Then you run off to Paris,

15:29.578 --> 15:31.654
Brigitte breaks up with you,
and you run back here.

15:31.747 --> 15:34.173
How am I supposed to stay here
after what I did?

15:34.325 --> 15:35.916
I mean, what do we do?

15:35.936 --> 15:37.418
Just pretend it never happened?

15:37.512 --> 15:39.178
Yeah, welcome
to the last year of my life!

15:39.330 --> 15:40.939
When you rejected me,

15:41.090 --> 15:42.181
I was hurt and embarrassed,

15:42.333 --> 15:44.000
but I got through it.

15:44.093 --> 15:46.260
And it was worth it because...

15:46.354 --> 15:48.112
you are my best friend.

15:48.264 --> 15:50.597
You're my best friend, too.

15:50.617 --> 15:53.192
And if leaving is
what you really want to do,

15:53.286 --> 15:55.286
I will support you.

15:55.513 --> 15:58.498
But I would miss
seeing you every day.

16:00.368 --> 16:02.961
When you're not yelling at me,
we do have a lot of fun.

16:03.779 --> 16:05.946
So are we packing or unpacking?

16:06.040 --> 16:08.132
Unpacking.

16:08.359 --> 16:09.467
Great.

16:10.195 --> 16:11.544
And I'm sorry...

16:11.696 --> 16:13.304
what is this shirt?

16:13.456 --> 16:15.381
That's a real panty-dropper
in Budapest.

16:15.533 --> 16:16.641
Oh.

16:16.792 --> 16:20.311
I guess gravity
works differently over there.

16:25.318 --> 16:28.027
Hey, buddy.
What are you doing up here?

16:29.063 --> 16:30.971
Mm, aren't we friendly?

16:31.065 --> 16:32.973
I'm waiting for my girlfriend,

16:32.993 --> 16:35.718
who's also a Kat-- a human Kat.

16:35.811 --> 16:37.570
She's kind,

16:37.664 --> 16:40.665
beautiful, really funny...

16:43.503 --> 16:45.228
She's also a little late.

16:45.246 --> 16:47.380
Any idea where she is?

16:49.234 --> 16:51.492
Wait, am I supposed
to follow you?

16:51.511 --> 16:53.845
Oscar, have you seen
a black and gray cat?

16:53.996 --> 16:55.179
Yeah, he went that way.

16:55.331 --> 16:56.906
You had him and you let him go?!

16:56.999 --> 16:58.741
I didn't know he was on the lam.

16:58.760 --> 16:59.833
There he is!

16:59.927 --> 17:01.077
Don't you jump!

17:01.095 --> 17:03.412
That nine lives thing
may not be true!

17:03.431 --> 17:05.248
BOTH:
No!

17:05.266 --> 17:08.175
Oh, dang!
Now he's on that ledge?

17:08.194 --> 17:10.177
And he's on the move.

17:10.196 --> 17:12.488
You see, I try to like cats,
I really do.

17:14.517 --> 17:15.867
Maybe you're right.

17:16.094 --> 17:17.777
I do run when things get tough.

17:17.929 --> 17:19.203
Like...

17:19.355 --> 17:21.039
I wish
I'd stuck with songwriting.

17:21.190 --> 17:22.707
You were really good at it, too.

17:22.858 --> 17:24.042
I just, I got

17:24.269 --> 17:25.526
so tired of being rejected

17:25.620 --> 17:27.361
that I convinced myself
I didn't really want it.

17:27.380 --> 17:28.713
Well, you should try again.

17:28.940 --> 17:31.365
I mean, think of all the
heartache you've had this year.

17:31.384 --> 17:34.126
Brigitte dumped you, I rejected
you, you're unemployed.

17:34.279 --> 17:36.462
That's, like, enough
for a Taylor Swift album.

17:37.632 --> 17:39.965
Only you can make
those things sound positive.

17:40.060 --> 17:41.893
Mm, positivity is my drug.

17:42.044 --> 17:43.803
That and Christmas movies
in July.

17:43.955 --> 17:45.063
Just July?

17:45.290 --> 17:47.807
Okay, year-round.
I have a problem.

17:47.959 --> 17:49.141
(chuckles)

17:49.294 --> 17:51.235
I hope Oscar knows
what he's getting into.

17:51.387 --> 17:52.795
Oscar!

17:52.814 --> 17:54.906
Oscar who's on my roof right now
probably wondering

17:55.057 --> 17:56.557
where the hell I am! Got to run.

17:56.576 --> 17:59.318
Glad you're staying.
Burn that shirt.

17:59.470 --> 18:00.653
(door closes)

18:00.805 --> 18:03.247
Don't you listen to her--
you're awesome.

18:08.404 --> 18:10.755
I don't know why I have
to be the dangler!

18:10.906 --> 18:13.316
Because I have
trust issues with you.

18:13.409 --> 18:15.818
Randi, you're gonna fall back
and Phil will catch you.

18:15.837 --> 18:17.929
-Got it.
-One, two...

18:18.156 --> 18:19.655
-three.
-Oh!

18:19.674 --> 18:20.990
Hey!

18:21.083 --> 18:23.175
Don't got it.

18:23.269 --> 18:25.328
Just remember,
you fell onto carpet.

18:25.346 --> 18:28.088
I will become street pizza.

18:28.108 --> 18:29.682
(singsongy):
Houdini.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.109
(giggles) Come here.

18:31.260 --> 18:34.003
Damn it, Phil,
why aren't you taller?

18:34.021 --> 18:36.114
My mother smoked!

18:36.265 --> 18:38.023
Kitty, kitty, kitt-- I got him!

18:38.176 --> 18:40.326
I got him-- oh! Don't got him.

18:43.014 --> 18:44.347
Well...

18:44.365 --> 18:46.958
this is a different kind of day.

18:49.187 --> 18:51.203
I'm here, I'm here.

18:51.297 --> 18:54.281
Oh, good, I thought
you were gonna miss it.

18:54.375 --> 18:56.041
(exhales)

18:56.194 --> 18:58.386
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

19:12.301 --> 19:15.044
So it says here on your résumé
that you quit your last job

19:15.155 --> 19:16.879
and you left
your employer/friend

19:16.972 --> 19:17.971
high and dry.

19:18.065 --> 19:19.640
I said I'm sorry.

19:19.734 --> 19:22.568
It also says that your height
and good looks are annoying.

19:23.329 --> 19:25.145
Not the first time
I've heard that.

19:25.165 --> 19:26.664
Can I have my job back?

19:26.891 --> 19:27.957
No.

19:29.394 --> 19:31.669
Okay, yes. Damn that smile!

19:33.173 --> 19:35.915
So how was the golf tournament?

19:36.009 --> 19:38.492
Did you by chance get to talk
to Matthew McConaughey?

19:38.586 --> 19:41.012
Gosh, you know,
he was really busy.

19:41.239 --> 19:42.405
Oh, yeah, that's okay.

19:42.498 --> 19:44.998
I'm sure he's
forgotten about it anyway.

19:45.092 --> 19:46.575
(chuckles)
Totally.

19:46.594 --> 19:48.519
(laughs)

19:48.671 --> 19:50.763
You know,
when I mentioned Phil's name,

19:50.915 --> 19:52.339
he threw his golf clubs
in the lake

19:52.433 --> 19:54.609
and then he head-butted
Ted Danson.

19:56.196 --> 19:57.920
I can't believe they came back.

19:57.939 --> 20:00.272
Should I pitch them my idea
for a TV show?

20:00.425 --> 20:02.366
-No, you should not.
-But it's really good.

20:02.593 --> 20:04.017
No, it is not.

20:04.111 --> 20:05.703
Can you just try to be normal.

20:05.854 --> 20:07.872
You know how hard
that is for me.

20:08.099 --> 20:10.499
It's really hard.

20:11.544 --> 20:12.785
Oh, yay!

20:12.879 --> 20:14.603
Whoa, she's at it again!

20:14.697 --> 20:16.105
-Oh!
-There it is.

20:16.123 --> 20:17.273
I still got it.

20:17.291 --> 20:19.866
I think I'm gonna
adopt this fella.

20:19.961 --> 20:21.201
Oh!

20:21.295 --> 20:23.112
Well, that's fantastic!

20:23.130 --> 20:24.889
Celebrity cat.

20:25.040 --> 20:27.800
Hey, that would be a great show.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.060
Normal!

20:29.287 --> 20:31.211
Well, we're gonna miss

20:31.231 --> 20:32.805
this little ball of fur.

20:32.957 --> 20:35.066
Houdini's created quite a bit
of excitement around here.

20:35.293 --> 20:37.460
Oh, Oscar, Oscar,
come meet the stars

20:37.478 --> 20:39.737
of my favorite TV show
when I was growing up.

20:39.964 --> 20:41.814
Oscar, this is Joey

20:41.908 --> 20:43.890
and Jenna and...

20:43.910 --> 20:45.243
Michael.

20:45.394 --> 20:47.136
Right, right, Michael.
The older brother.

20:47.154 --> 20:49.638
-Ah!
-Nice to meet you all.

20:49.657 --> 20:51.749
Nice meeting you, too.
Congrats on being chosen, man.

20:51.900 --> 20:53.066
Thanks.

20:53.160 --> 20:54.234
-Chosen for what?
-Um, dodgeball.

20:54.328 --> 20:55.478
We're thinking
of starting a team.

20:55.496 --> 20:57.088
Can you go grab me
a coffee, please?

20:57.315 --> 20:59.590
Way to go, Joey Lawrence.

20:59.742 --> 21:01.333
Ow!
