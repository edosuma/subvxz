WEBVTT

00:12.083 --> 00:14.208
Well, that's the last of Dad's stuff.

00:14.291 --> 00:16.875
It doesn't spark joy,
which is why I'm getting rid of it.

00:16.958 --> 00:19.041
It's the same reason
I got rid of your father.

00:19.125 --> 00:20.666
Jesus, Mom, harsh.

00:20.750 --> 00:22.833
-Are you talking about me?

00:22.916 --> 00:24.416
I'm not dealing with this!

00:24.500 --> 00:26.541
I'm filled with light and love.

00:26.625 --> 00:28.375
Light and love, asshole!

00:28.458 --> 00:30.375
Oh, the hell you are!

00:30.958 --> 00:32.125
Okay, I kind of get it.

00:32.208 --> 00:35.458
Luckily, divorcing your father this year
has finally given me time

00:35.541 --> 00:37.666
to transform my pain into art.

00:38.250 --> 00:43.416
"Knight of Passion,
a sexventure by Tamiko Ridley."

00:43.500 --> 00:45.750
"One woman's erotic personal journey

00:45.833 --> 00:47.875
divorcing her narcissist husband

00:47.958 --> 00:50.666
and dealing with a daughter
with Asperger's."

00:50.750 --> 00:53.500
Wait, what the hell?
You think I have Asperger's?

00:54.250 --> 00:56.041
-No.
-Oh, okay.

00:56.125 --> 00:57.541
See, you couldn't tell I was lying.

00:57.625 --> 01:00.041
You ought to look that condition up.
It gets worse over time.

01:00.125 --> 01:01.541
Ciao, darling!

01:02.041 --> 01:04.125
How was she? Did she look unhappy?

01:04.208 --> 01:06.250
How fulfilled did she look, physically?

01:06.333 --> 01:07.291
She's still Mom,

01:07.375 --> 01:10.583
undercutting my confidence
in ways I didn't know existed.

01:11.083 --> 01:12.541
Man, what is all this stuff?

01:12.625 --> 01:14.000
My old inventions.

01:14.083 --> 01:16.833
Remember that robot
teddy bear I invented for you?

01:16.916 --> 01:19.250
And here's
that pair of walkie-talkie headgear.

01:19.333 --> 01:21.458
Remember your third grade photo?

01:22.041 --> 01:26.125
Ugh! Dad, I can't keep track
of every traumatizing thing you invented.

01:26.208 --> 01:27.083
What's this?

01:27.166 --> 01:29.041
Eh. Probably a garage door opener.

01:35.083 --> 01:38.541
-Three, two, one.

02:04.250 --> 02:06.541
Sorry I'm late.
I've dealt with nuclear standoffs

02:06.625 --> 02:08.208
less stressful than my parents' divorce.

02:08.291 --> 02:11.291
-Ooh, girl, your eyes are sunken.

02:11.375 --> 02:14.333
You look like if Steve Buscemi
made it with Steve Buscemi. You okay?

02:14.416 --> 02:15.541
Guys, I'm honestly fine.

02:15.625 --> 02:19.083
I've been channeling my stress
into this scream bag

02:19.166 --> 02:20.875
and into my latest invention.

02:20.958 --> 02:23.791
Behold, the Productivitron.

02:23.875 --> 02:25.666
-Oh God, robot arms!
-Christ Almighty!

02:25.750 --> 02:27.375
I'm still working out the kinks,

02:27.458 --> 02:32.791
but it's a set of bio-cranial robot arms
that will increase my productivity 600%!

02:32.875 --> 02:36.708
Now I can simultaneously finish paperwork,
ignore my dad's texts,

02:36.791 --> 02:39.500
and, you know,
strangle anyone who crosses me, I guess.

02:41.791 --> 02:44.375
Every day you edge closer
to becoming a supervillain.

02:46.458 --> 02:47.291
Oh God, what's that?

02:47.375 --> 02:49.416
Is it a nuclear disaster?

02:49.500 --> 02:52.958
No, it's even worse! It's a PR disaster!

02:53.041 --> 02:57.000
I'm not gonna sugarcoat it.
This is a 13-alarm crap fire.

02:57.083 --> 03:00.791
I accidentally hit "reply all"
to a company-wide email

03:00.875 --> 03:05.416
where I made
a very un-PC joke about reptoids.

03:05.500 --> 03:08.250
-Question. What is reptoids?

03:08.333 --> 03:10.583
Oh, just your classic
shape-shifting lizard people

03:10.666 --> 03:12.250
that live in secret amongst humanity.

03:12.916 --> 03:15.833
Mm-hmm.
We're talking politicians, celebrities.

03:15.916 --> 03:18.375
Madonna's an iguana?

03:18.458 --> 03:21.125
Reptoids provide
a lot of our company's funding,

03:21.208 --> 03:24.750
and in exchange, we prevent the world
from doing anything about global warming

03:24.833 --> 03:26.541
to keep them at their preferred body heat.

03:26.625 --> 03:27.916
The system works.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.500
If we wanna keep this year's funding,

03:29.583 --> 03:32.500
we need to kiss ass
at their annual Reptoid Gala

03:32.583 --> 03:34.291
to get them to sign this contract.

03:34.375 --> 03:36.875
It's being held
at their stronghold at Yale.

03:36.958 --> 03:38.666
Ah, I remember my days at Yale.

03:38.750 --> 03:40.791
I was the most popular guy in my frat.

03:40.875 --> 03:42.833
They hazed me every year.

03:42.916 --> 03:44.916
-Sounds like they hated you?

03:45.000 --> 03:47.166
Nice haze burn, Andre.
You must really like me.

03:47.750 --> 03:48.583
Do I have to go?

03:48.666 --> 03:50.583
Follow-up question.
Do I have to wear a dress?

03:50.666 --> 03:53.708
Follow-up to the follow-up.
Does it have to be a stain-free dress?

03:53.791 --> 03:55.291
No, you can't recycle

03:55.375 --> 03:58.541
your old Space Jam prom dress
yet again, Reagan.

03:58.625 --> 03:59.625
This is serious.

03:59.708 --> 04:01.291
What? That dress is awesome.

04:01.375 --> 04:03.708
And if you don't agree, you're a Mon--

04:03.791 --> 04:05.125
Monstar. Yeah, yeah.

04:05.208 --> 04:06.083
Normal dress!

04:06.166 --> 04:08.333
And for the love of God, comb your hair.

04:08.416 --> 04:09.875
It's a sign of respect.

04:09.958 --> 04:12.833
Why should we give
those reptoid freaks respect?

04:12.916 --> 04:15.750
Half-man, half-animal. They're disgusting!

04:15.833 --> 04:18.125
Easy, big guy. Have a mackerel.

04:19.833 --> 04:24.208
Glenn, that's exactly the kind
of no-no talk that could end our funding,

04:24.291 --> 04:28.583
which is why I've signed you all up
for reptoid sensitivity training.

04:30.166 --> 04:31.708
Training? Hell yeah.

04:31.791 --> 04:33.583
Who's ready to get some reps in?

04:33.666 --> 04:34.958
Oh no.

04:35.041 --> 04:38.250
Is "reps" offensive to say?

04:39.166 --> 04:42.166
Hi, everyone.
Welcome to Inhuman Resources.

04:42.250 --> 04:43.958
I'm Mr. Mothman.

04:44.041 --> 04:45.541
I'm a Mothman.

04:45.625 --> 04:47.708
Let's talk about reptoids.

04:47.791 --> 04:52.208
Be sure to follow these dos and don'ts
to avoid a diplomatic incident.

04:52.291 --> 04:56.208
Do offer them a cricket,
mouse, or vole out of your pocket.

04:56.291 --> 04:57.958
Fun fact about voles,

04:58.041 --> 04:59.458
a vole ate my father.

05:00.625 --> 05:04.125
Don't use loaded phrases like "hissy fit,"

05:04.208 --> 05:06.208
or "see you later, alligator."

05:06.291 --> 05:09.583
Got it. Be respectful.
So when do we talk about the orgies?

05:09.666 --> 05:11.250
-Boo!
-Oh, come on!

05:11.333 --> 05:14.208
What? Everyone knows
reptoids have orgies.

05:14.291 --> 05:19.375
Sign me up. I love sex,
and I am fucking good at it.

05:19.458 --> 05:21.208
This is okay to say in here, right?

05:21.291 --> 05:23.083
This is an HR meeting!

05:23.166 --> 05:26.000
Andre, Myc, shut the hell up,
or I will castrate you.

05:26.083 --> 05:29.583
Ha! Good luck figuring out
which one of my tentacles is a dick.

05:30.916 --> 05:33.541
Trick question, it's all of them.

05:34.916 --> 05:36.583
As a final training step,

05:36.666 --> 05:39.166
we're gonna practice
the traditional reptoid greeting,

05:39.250 --> 05:42.333
a firm, nonsexual hug to transfer warmth.

05:42.416 --> 05:44.958
Hugs! This is my jam.

05:45.041 --> 05:49.125
Hug? Like, with… with our bodies
touching other people's bodies?

05:50.041 --> 05:52.375
Mmm. Oh that's nice.

05:52.458 --> 05:54.500
Mmm. Huh, back for seconds?

05:56.083 --> 05:58.791
-You okay, Reagan?
-Yeah, I'm… I'm just… I'm… I'm fine.

05:58.875 --> 06:02.291
I'm ju… I'm practicing a hug
that a normal person would do.

06:05.791 --> 06:07.250
What was that?

06:07.333 --> 06:08.625
I… I don't know.

06:08.708 --> 06:11.416
Elliot Mothman,
you need to finish your master's

06:11.500 --> 06:13.333
and get the fuck out of this office.

06:15.416 --> 06:17.208
Brett, congratulations.

06:17.291 --> 06:19.458
As the one person
who didn't assault anyone,

06:19.541 --> 06:21.666
physically or sexually, in that meeting,

06:21.750 --> 06:25.125
I want you to give the ceremonial toast
at the gala tonight.

06:25.208 --> 06:26.125
Nice!

06:26.208 --> 06:28.500
And, Reagan,
whatever this problem is, fix it.

06:28.583 --> 06:31.541
We can't risk an episode like this
in front of the reptoids.

06:31.625 --> 06:34.208
I am so sorry about that.
I don't know what came over me.

06:34.291 --> 06:37.666
My body just auto-punched
when I felt that hug close in.

06:37.750 --> 06:41.458
-I'm done listening now.
-What the hell is wrong with me?

06:41.541 --> 06:44.750
Yeah, not gonna lie, even for you,
that's Reaganier than usual.

06:44.833 --> 06:47.875
Maybe you should tell J.R.
you're gonna sit this one out.

06:47.958 --> 06:51.666
Brett, I'm going to this goddamn party.
I'm gonna figure this out and prove

06:51.750 --> 06:55.000
that I am not the socially inept weirdo
that everyone thinks I am.

06:57.666 --> 06:59.625
Diggity denial. I love it.

07:01.958 --> 07:04.083
Bullshit, lies, slander!

07:04.166 --> 07:07.000
This novel is
all thinly veiled horny criticism

07:07.083 --> 07:07.916
of our lives.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.583
Oh, you found Mom's book.

07:09.666 --> 07:10.500
Listen to this.

07:10.583 --> 07:14.458
"Lord Randrew was a terrible husband
and an even worse father."

07:14.541 --> 07:16.166
Me? A bad dad?

07:17.000 --> 07:19.708
Would a bad dad make his little girl this?

07:21.041 --> 07:24.125
Ugh. Why are you putting
that horror show back together?

07:24.208 --> 07:27.250
To set the record straight.
I took care of your every need,

07:27.333 --> 07:30.625
and I have a whole box
of inventions to prove it.

07:30.708 --> 07:33.875
Look at this!
Boy-repelling pheromone spray, huh?

07:33.958 --> 07:35.625
Who needs birth control now?

07:35.708 --> 07:39.500
The Britney Spears perfume you gave me
was literal boy repellent?

07:39.583 --> 07:43.750
Yep. See? Any time you had a problem,
I invented something to fix it.

07:44.250 --> 07:47.291
"Invented something to fix it."

07:57.375 --> 08:00.041
This place smells like
Teslas and inbreeding.

08:00.125 --> 08:01.083
Ooh, boy.

08:01.166 --> 08:04.666
This fungi
is ready for fun, guys!

08:06.083 --> 08:06.916
What was that?

08:07.000 --> 08:09.666
Nothing.
Who's ready to partay?

08:10.166 --> 08:13.625
Now, remember, everyone,
we need that contract, so no slipups.

08:13.708 --> 08:17.166
Don't point and stare.
Don't touch their throat sacs.

08:17.250 --> 08:21.333
And if a lizard asks you your favorite
Hogwarts house, what do you say?

08:21.416 --> 08:24.250
-Slytherin!
-Hufflepuff. I mean, Slytherin.

08:24.333 --> 08:26.500
Oh, honey, you ain't fooling anybody.

08:29.291 --> 08:30.125
Password.

08:30.208 --> 08:32.875
Oh hell, it's something in Latin, I think.

08:32.958 --> 08:36.000
Uh, dra… draconius pluribus… I don't know.

08:36.083 --> 08:38.500
Look, here's how much money's
in my bank account.

08:39.125 --> 08:40.208
Welcome.

08:42.458 --> 08:45.000
-Welcome to the other side.

08:45.083 --> 08:49.250
You wanna talk about connections?
These preptiles literally have blue blood.

08:50.375 --> 08:52.541
This is incredible.

08:52.625 --> 08:55.083
I can't believe who's secretly a reptoid.

08:55.166 --> 08:58.041
Anderson Cooper? Taylor Swift?

08:58.125 --> 09:01.458
So the song "Shake It Off" was about
how I shed my skin every thousand years,

09:01.541 --> 09:03.125
and the song "Bad Blood" was about

09:03.208 --> 09:05.541
how I drink blood
out of my Grammys.

09:06.208 --> 09:08.291
A toast to blood!

09:08.375 --> 09:09.833
Save some blood for Paul Rudd!

09:11.833 --> 09:14.541
So that's why Paul Rudd never ages.

09:14.625 --> 09:17.791
Oh, oh, look. Sex masks. It's happening.

09:18.916 --> 09:21.416
Reagan, did you take care
of your hug problem?

09:21.500 --> 09:24.958
-Let's just say I've got it in the bag.

09:25.041 --> 09:28.125
Unless you have 30 years of therapy
in there, I'm skeptical.

09:28.208 --> 09:31.041
I'm going to find the diplomats.
Brett, practice your speech.

09:31.125 --> 09:32.666
Glenn, don't say anything racist.

09:32.750 --> 09:34.875
Gigi, make sure Glenn
doesn't say anything racist.

09:34.958 --> 09:36.708
Just like Mel Gibson's Hanukkah special.

09:36.791 --> 09:37.625
-Got it.

09:37.708 --> 09:38.750
And Reagan…

09:38.833 --> 09:39.875
Reagan?

09:45.083 --> 09:47.208
Prepare to interact socially.

09:47.291 --> 09:49.333
Reaction hologram on.

09:49.416 --> 09:51.208
I am reacting appropriately

09:51.291 --> 09:54.125
to the thing you just said.
Small talk acknowledged.

09:54.208 --> 09:56.875
Eh, that's a bit much.
But these work!

09:58.291 --> 10:01.583
Ha ha! Who's an antisocial weirdo now?

10:01.666 --> 10:04.583
Not the girl who invented robot arms
to hug strangers.

10:04.666 --> 10:06.500
Oh my God, I sound insane.

10:09.250 --> 10:12.916
Ah, Yale. I've gone from public streaker
to public speaker.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.666
If only my frat brothers could see me now.

10:15.750 --> 10:17.166
Handjob?

10:17.250 --> 10:19.291
PJ? Skwoo?

10:19.375 --> 10:21.083
Up, down, roofie, roofie,

10:21.166 --> 10:23.125
become a Supreme Court justice.

10:23.208 --> 10:25.333
And nut punch!

10:27.000 --> 10:29.916
Oh man, I haven't been punched
in the nuts in years.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
What are you two doing here?

10:32.083 --> 10:33.500
Don't you know this event is for…

10:33.583 --> 10:35.541
…izard-lay eople-pay?

10:35.625 --> 10:37.625
So about that…

10:39.750 --> 10:43.541
What? You guys
were reptoids all this time?

10:43.625 --> 10:46.291
Why didn't you tell me?
I'm your frat brother.

10:46.375 --> 10:48.458
I gave you my kidney.

10:48.958 --> 10:50.875
And it was delicious.

10:50.958 --> 10:54.833
Honestly, we only revealed our secrets
to brothers who reached level six.

10:55.416 --> 10:57.291
-You never got that high.

10:57.375 --> 11:00.916
Guys, I'm Brett Hand, campus legend.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.416
Whatever it takes, I'm getting that ring.

11:03.500 --> 11:06.583
I don't know. I mean,
first you'd have to prove your loyalty

11:06.666 --> 11:08.083
-by stripping down and--

11:08.750 --> 11:11.833
Wow, you just didn't even wait for me
to finish my sentence.

11:11.916 --> 11:14.083
Let the hazing begin!

11:22.000 --> 11:23.500
Reagan, there you are.

11:23.583 --> 11:25.625
Try not to look like
you're getting a colonoscopy.

11:25.708 --> 11:27.250
I need to find the reptoid honchos and--

11:27.333 --> 11:28.750
-J.R.
-Ah!

11:28.833 --> 11:32.208
Oh!
There you are, you old rascals.

11:32.291 --> 11:35.083
Reagan,
meet my favorite reptoidsentatives,

11:35.166 --> 11:39.541
Barb Shrike and Zarthax Griswold Walton
of the Reptoid High Council.

11:39.625 --> 11:41.958
Good evening, Your, uh, Lizardness.

11:42.041 --> 11:43.875
Oh, we're not that important.

11:43.958 --> 11:47.666
It's not like we control the world… yet!

11:51.333 --> 11:54.541
You know, all this laughing
is putting me in a contract-signing mood.

11:54.625 --> 11:56.291
I've got next year's budget right here

11:56.375 --> 11:58.375
if you wanna just
give her the old John Hancock.

11:58.458 --> 11:59.958
Not so fast, J.R.

12:00.041 --> 12:03.375
Don't think we missed
your hilarious email.

12:03.875 --> 12:05.916
If you want us to embrace your funding,

12:06.000 --> 12:09.333
we need to know
that your company takes us seriously.

12:09.416 --> 12:11.125
We absolutely do.

12:11.625 --> 12:12.541
Right, Reagan?

12:14.000 --> 12:15.416
Uh…

12:20.041 --> 12:22.791
Well, that was an impressively firm hug.

12:22.875 --> 12:25.333
I think you might have popped
a disc back into place.

12:25.416 --> 12:27.291
-Oh, my turn.

12:27.375 --> 12:29.291
Wow, can you be my chiropractor?

12:29.375 --> 12:30.708
Not for free, I can't.

12:33.208 --> 12:36.375
She gets it.
And I absolutely love your skin.

12:36.458 --> 12:38.041
How do you get it that scaly?

12:38.125 --> 12:41.250
Hey, fuck you… using moisturizer!

12:41.333 --> 12:43.291
The drier the better, right, baby?

12:43.375 --> 12:45.041
Mmm, I like this one.

12:45.125 --> 12:47.625
J.R., let's talk contracts
after the ceremony.

12:47.708 --> 12:49.166
And make sure you bring her.

12:49.250 --> 12:52.625
Ha! I did it! I think I just conquered
my weird mental hang-up

12:52.708 --> 12:54.583
without any self-examination.

12:54.666 --> 12:56.291
-Yeah!
-You're a hit!

12:56.375 --> 12:58.458
Ooh, let me introduce you to Al Gore.

12:58.541 --> 13:01.958
My real name is Alligator Gore.

13:08.041 --> 13:11.000
-Huh?
-Oh. Come on, man. Where's the action?

13:11.083 --> 13:13.291
I'm peaking. I don't wanna miss this.

13:13.375 --> 13:15.916
One of these has gotta be
the secret door. Okay, what is it?

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Secret door, secret door…

13:19.916 --> 13:21.958
Ugh, these are just actual books.

13:22.041 --> 13:23.916
Books are like the opposite of sex!

13:24.000 --> 13:26.166
This place is such a croc tease.

13:26.250 --> 13:28.625
-Harder, my bros!

13:28.708 --> 13:31.416
Whoo.
Yeah, you got it.

13:31.500 --> 13:34.708
Don't patronize me, Skwoo.
Make me earn it.

13:34.791 --> 13:37.291
Eh, you're right.
We've been holding back on you.

13:37.375 --> 13:42.166
Uh, it's time to take you
to the Chamber of Secrets.

13:42.250 --> 13:46.208
Reveal your secrets to the chamber.

13:46.291 --> 13:48.125
Here's one. Um, I stay awake at night…

13:48.208 --> 13:50.666
…because I don't even know
what my favorite color is,

13:50.750 --> 13:53.083
and I'm afraid I don't have
a real personality.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.333
Wow, that is dark.

13:55.416 --> 13:57.208
Speaking of dark,
catch you on the other side.

13:59.791 --> 14:02.166
Hiss, hiss. So lovely to meet you.

14:04.083 --> 14:05.208
Lovely.

14:05.291 --> 14:07.291
Reagan, you're the life of this party.

14:07.375 --> 14:10.625
That's the most natural smile
I've ever seen out of Mark Zuckerberg.

14:13.916 --> 14:16.000
Huh. You never should've doubted me, J.R.

14:16.083 --> 14:20.083
With this brain and these arms,
I can do literally anything.

14:20.166 --> 14:25.125
Everyone to the main stage.
The celebration is about to begin!

14:25.208 --> 14:27.833
Boo! Go back to your terrariums!

14:34.333 --> 14:37.875
All rise for the reptilian anthem!

14:51.333 --> 14:54.041
Let's get down to lizness.

14:54.125 --> 14:56.291
We reptoids have had a great decade.

14:56.375 --> 14:58.458
Thanks to propaganda in the media,

14:58.541 --> 15:01.666
we have made society
more tolerant of our kind,

15:01.750 --> 15:04.125
from the Geico Gecko
to The Shape of Water.

15:05.166 --> 15:09.375
We even got K. Rool in Smash!
We did it, everyone!

15:09.458 --> 15:11.416
The world temperature is rising.

15:11.500 --> 15:13.125
The time is coming, brethren.

15:13.208 --> 15:15.375
Soon we shall fulfill the prophecy,

15:15.458 --> 15:21.500
overthrow humanity,
and become the true rulers of the world!

15:21.583 --> 15:24.583
They say that every year,
but they're never gonna do it.

15:24.666 --> 15:28.833
And now, a look back
at the reptoids we lost this year.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.958
-It's almost time for the speech.

15:37.041 --> 15:38.291
Where's Brett?

15:40.041 --> 15:43.208
Oh man,
I can't wait till I get to level six.

15:43.291 --> 15:45.666
I bet that's when they let you
into the group text chat.

15:45.750 --> 15:47.041
Hey, my blindfold!

15:48.833 --> 15:50.583
Oh my God! Oh my God!

15:50.666 --> 15:53.583
He's just as pathetic
as he was in college.

15:53.666 --> 15:55.208
Hey, hey. Who am I? Who am I?

15:55.291 --> 15:59.250
Uh, I think I'm popular,
but nobody can stand me.

15:59.333 --> 16:00.208
Brett Hand.

16:00.291 --> 16:01.375
Ooh!

16:01.458 --> 16:02.791
He got it! He got it!

16:02.875 --> 16:05.875
-Bros? But I thought I was a legend.

16:08.375 --> 16:10.041
Maybe you'll be my friends.

16:10.541 --> 16:12.125
Ah! Ah! Ah! Rats!

16:12.208 --> 16:13.708
Rats are biting my dick!

16:13.791 --> 16:15.708
…soon hear
from our human partner.

16:15.791 --> 16:17.625
This is a disaster. Brett's missing!

16:17.708 --> 16:20.416
And I can't give the speech,
because I spilled dip on my crotch,

16:20.500 --> 16:22.208
and I cannot stand up!

16:22.291 --> 16:24.250
Reagan, I need you to give the speech.

16:24.333 --> 16:25.291
What, me?

16:25.375 --> 16:27.958
You said it yourself.
You've conquered all your issues.

16:28.041 --> 16:30.125
-But--
-Go, go! You're going to crush it.

16:31.291 --> 16:36.583
And now, please give a warm welcome
to Cognito Inc.

16:44.583 --> 16:47.166
Ah! What is up, reptoids?

16:47.250 --> 16:51.625
Anybody here from a… a subterranean lair?

16:54.125 --> 16:55.333
But seriously,

16:55.833 --> 16:59.083
reptoids, humans, we're not so different.

16:59.166 --> 17:02.708
We all have hearts, minds, um,

17:02.791 --> 17:03.916
cloacas?

17:04.000 --> 17:05.583
I do have a cloaca.

17:07.500 --> 17:09.958
Sure, we may have messed up in the past

17:10.041 --> 17:14.291
but not as bad as those idiot Atlantians.

17:14.375 --> 17:16.583
-Fuck Atlantis!

17:16.666 --> 17:18.125
Oh my God.

17:18.708 --> 17:20.458
I'm Reagan Ridley,

17:20.541 --> 17:22.750
and on behalf of Cognito Inc.,

17:22.833 --> 17:26.125
let us raise a glass
to our continued alliance.

17:33.958 --> 17:35.333
Oh, thank Christ.

17:35.416 --> 17:38.416
Reagan Ridley from Cognito Inc., everyone.

17:38.500 --> 17:40.458
Ha! Bring it in, buddy.

17:40.541 --> 17:42.625
-That's too tight. Help.

17:42.708 --> 17:45.541
-You're crushing me!
-Wait, sorry. Let me just-- Reverse!

17:51.083 --> 17:53.875
Oh God, my arms! My arms!

18:03.875 --> 18:06.291
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

18:06.375 --> 18:08.208
She's trying to run! Grab her!

18:08.958 --> 18:10.875
Sorry! I didn't mean that!

18:11.458 --> 18:13.208
-Hmm.

18:21.833 --> 18:22.750
Huh?

18:23.333 --> 18:24.708
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

18:24.791 --> 18:27.291
-We're not friends at all!

18:31.166 --> 18:32.333
Go, go, go!

18:34.333 --> 18:36.833
Are you also being chased
by a horde of rats?

18:36.916 --> 18:39.000
What? No. Why are you naked?

18:39.083 --> 18:40.666
Tonight was complicated!

18:42.791 --> 18:45.208
Please don't cut our funding.
I have mistresses to feed.

18:45.291 --> 18:46.125
Funding?

18:46.208 --> 18:49.833
After what just happened, you're lucky
we don't launch war on humanity right now.

18:51.125 --> 18:54.083
There's gotta be a way out of this.
What about a human sacrifice, huh?

18:54.166 --> 18:56.875
I carry a saber of sacrifice at all times.

18:58.041 --> 19:00.541
This is a disaster. Where's Reagan?

19:00.625 --> 19:02.583
The heir
to the Griswold Walton fortune

19:02.666 --> 19:05.875
was rushed to the hospital tonight
after having his arms brutally ripped off.

19:05.958 --> 19:06.958
He had this to say.

19:07.041 --> 19:11.375
The lizard army
will bathe in the blood of man!

19:11.458 --> 19:13.500
In other news,
global temperature raised

19:13.583 --> 19:14.708
one degree today.

19:14.791 --> 19:17.875
Well, I'm definitely
a fugitive from the law now.

19:17.958 --> 19:21.666
I don't know why I can't hug anyone
without losing my fucking mind.

19:21.750 --> 19:24.125
You know, Reagan,
I get mad social anxiety too,

19:24.208 --> 19:28.166
but talking about it with my therapist
has cut my panic attacks in half!

19:28.250 --> 19:29.250
Brap, brap, brap!

19:29.333 --> 19:31.250
Are you saying that I should…

19:31.333 --> 19:33.291
…talk about my feelings?

19:33.375 --> 19:35.458
When's the last time
you were hugged? Hit me.

19:35.541 --> 19:37.541
The last time I was hugged was…

19:38.041 --> 19:39.125
Huh.

19:39.208 --> 19:40.833
Wow, I actually can't remember.

19:40.916 --> 19:42.791
That's really weird, right?

19:42.875 --> 19:45.083
You'll figure it out. You always do.

19:45.166 --> 19:47.875
Just like I'm gonna figure out
a way to impress PJ and Skwoo

19:47.958 --> 19:49.166
and get to level six,

19:49.250 --> 19:51.958
because I need everyone to like me,
and I freak out if they don't.

19:52.041 --> 19:53.666
Brett, why do you care about those guys?

19:53.750 --> 19:56.583
They pushed you in a ventilation shaft
and covered you with rats.

19:56.666 --> 19:58.833
Yeah, but isn't that what friends do?

19:58.916 --> 20:02.333
No. Friends give each other rides
and good advice.

20:09.041 --> 20:12.291
Come out with your hands up,
you pink-fleshed motherfuckers!

20:12.375 --> 20:13.750
You tell 'em, Bill.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.958
-Thanks so much. Be kind to one another.

20:22.041 --> 20:23.791
-Okay.

20:26.625 --> 20:28.750
Time to load up my Emmy cannon.

20:30.458 --> 20:33.416
I'll take my tea
in the panic room, thank you.

20:33.500 --> 20:35.666
-Anderson Cooper coming to you live from--

20:35.750 --> 20:37.541
Uh, sorry, one moment.

20:39.583 --> 20:42.625
Coming to you live
from the Reptoid Supreme Court.

20:43.666 --> 20:45.375
Well, Reagan, the bad news is,

20:45.458 --> 20:47.583
if you lose this trial, it may mean war.

20:47.666 --> 20:50.833
The good news is, I got you
the best lawyer who cost us nothing.

20:50.916 --> 20:54.041
Don't worry about it, honey.
I can convince anyone of anything.

20:54.125 --> 20:57.166
Just today,
I convinced myself I was a lawyer.

21:00.458 --> 21:03.500
Please welcome
our high justice of the Reptoid Court,

21:03.583 --> 21:06.125
the immortal queen of darkness herself,

21:06.208 --> 21:08.083
Judge Judy!

21:08.166 --> 21:10.416
-Judge Judy!

21:10.500 --> 21:12.458
Thank you, bailiff.
I have a shoot in 20 minutes,

21:12.541 --> 21:14.666
so let's make this quick.
What are the charges?

21:14.750 --> 21:17.750
Your Honor,
Ms. Ridley ripped off our leader's arms

21:17.833 --> 21:20.416
in an act of hostile bigotry
towards reptoids.

21:22.708 --> 21:24.291
-Boo!
-Boo!

21:24.375 --> 21:26.125
This true? You rip his arms off?

21:26.208 --> 21:27.958
Yes, technically. But--

21:28.041 --> 21:31.000
All right, rip her arms off
and call it even. Thank you.

21:31.083 --> 21:32.041
Your Honor, please.

21:32.125 --> 21:36.083
I intend to prove that my client might be,
damn, weird as shit,

21:36.166 --> 21:39.541
but she doesn't discriminate.
She's like that to everybody.

21:39.625 --> 21:41.750
The defense calls Brett Hand!

21:41.833 --> 21:44.333
Oh yeah, Reagan can't hug anybody.

21:44.416 --> 21:45.791
See this bruise on my face?

21:45.875 --> 21:48.791
That's from one of her hugs,
and we're friends.

21:49.416 --> 21:52.375
I don't wanna diagnose,
but maybe Asperger's?

21:52.458 --> 21:53.500
Oh, come on!

21:53.583 --> 21:55.208
I plead the Fifth

21:55.291 --> 21:56.291
and the Second!

21:57.625 --> 22:00.458
She's always had
the hots for me but won't admit it.

22:00.541 --> 22:01.833
I mean, can you believe that?

22:01.916 --> 22:04.208
She's on her 95th HR violation.

22:04.291 --> 22:05.541
But who's counting?

22:05.625 --> 22:09.083
Me, I'm counting. Mr. Mothman is counting.

22:09.166 --> 22:10.375
I think this is working.

22:10.458 --> 22:12.916
Yeah,
I love this. It feels great.

22:14.291 --> 22:15.208
Sorry I'm late.

22:15.291 --> 22:17.791
A father should never miss
his daughter's first sentencing.

22:17.875 --> 22:21.291
On the bright side, I finally finished
reassembling Bear-o, so…

22:21.375 --> 22:22.666
…that's something.

22:22.750 --> 22:23.958
You brought that thing?

22:24.041 --> 22:25.750
Dad, this is serious.

22:25.833 --> 22:28.083
I could be going to jail for a long time,

22:28.166 --> 22:30.250
all because for some mysterious reason,

22:30.333 --> 22:32.583
I am unable to fucking hug.

22:32.666 --> 22:36.041
Hello, Reagan.
Would you like to give Bear-o a hug?

22:36.708 --> 22:39.541
A hug, a hug, a…

22:42.625 --> 22:44.375
Uh-oh. Someone needs a hug.

22:45.416 --> 22:49.458
There, there.
It's me, Bear-o. Initiating hug.

22:49.541 --> 22:51.375
No, Bear-o!

22:52.916 --> 22:54.416
-Initiating hug.
-Agh! Bear-o!

22:55.000 --> 22:56.500
-Initiating hug.
-Agh! Bear-o!

22:57.458 --> 22:58.916
-Initiating hug.
-No, Bear-o!

22:59.000 --> 23:00.916
-Initiating hug.

23:02.875 --> 23:06.166
Holy shit. You never hugged me.

23:06.250 --> 23:09.083
You made a robot bear do it instead.

23:09.166 --> 23:12.083
And I was so traumatized
that I repressed the memory for years!

23:12.166 --> 23:14.958
That's why I can't hug anyone
without losing my shit!

23:15.041 --> 23:16.458
Order! Ms. Ridley.

23:16.541 --> 23:19.958
Your Honor, allow me to call
Rand Ridley to the stand.

23:21.041 --> 23:23.375
I swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

23:23.458 --> 23:26.333
and nothing but the truth,
so help me Godzilla 2000.

23:26.958 --> 23:29.500
Would you call yourself a good father?

23:29.583 --> 23:32.541
I gave you a roof and stellar genetics,

23:32.625 --> 23:36.208
so despite what you may read
in any poorly written airport rags,

23:36.291 --> 23:38.208
yeah, I was a good father.

23:38.791 --> 23:41.291
I even created this amazing robot

23:41.375 --> 23:43.416
so it could hug you
whenever I wasn't around,

23:43.500 --> 23:44.458
which was always.

23:45.791 --> 23:48.500
What, people?
That touchy-feely crap makes you weak.

23:48.583 --> 23:50.666
My outside-the-box parenting

23:50.750 --> 23:54.375
raised a girl who's strong enough
to nearly murder a diplomat.

23:54.458 --> 23:56.625
Bear-o is proud of Reagan.

23:56.708 --> 23:58.875
Oh, shut the fuck up, Bear-o.

23:58.958 --> 24:01.625
Your shitty parenting
messed me up for life,

24:01.708 --> 24:04.625
and now I guess I'm broken forever.

24:06.416 --> 24:09.875
Hey, look, you know,
family is an experiment.

24:09.958 --> 24:13.375
And maybe not all my experiments
are perfect.

24:15.541 --> 24:18.375
I guess we could give this a try.

24:22.583 --> 24:25.000
All right. I mean,
is this doing anything for you?

24:25.083 --> 24:26.750
-No, not really.
-Yeah, it feels weird.

24:26.833 --> 24:28.583
-Right? That's what I'm saying.
-Super forced.

24:28.666 --> 24:30.458
-Why do people do this?

24:31.041 --> 24:33.208
-That helped.

24:33.291 --> 24:34.208
Well, I've seen enough.

24:34.291 --> 24:37.333
Ms. Ridley, you've clearly learned
some bad habits from this man.

24:37.416 --> 24:39.458
I'm surprised
you don't rip everyone's arms off.

24:39.541 --> 24:41.125
But I can't just let you off the hook,

24:41.208 --> 24:43.375
so I'm sentencing
you to court-ordered therapy

24:43.458 --> 24:45.125
in the form of…

24:45.208 --> 24:47.208
…the traditional reptoid group hug.

24:47.291 --> 24:48.166
Wait, what's this now?

24:53.750 --> 24:56.083
I'm deciding this is okay.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.750
Oh God, this is an orgy, isn't it?

25:02.833 --> 25:04.750
Oh yes. Yes, it is!

25:04.833 --> 25:07.416
-Gavel. Give me the gavel.

25:07.500 --> 25:08.833
Give me the gavel!

25:08.916 --> 25:11.291
This is it. It's happening.

25:11.375 --> 25:16.208
Hello, HR.
Who's ready for some gross misconduct?

25:16.291 --> 25:18.208
Incoming!

25:18.291 --> 25:19.416
Hey, guys, wait for…

25:20.041 --> 25:21.458
You know what? No.

25:21.541 --> 25:25.000
I don't need to have sex
with 100 strangers just to fit in,

25:25.083 --> 25:28.416
'cause I have a new frat now, Cognito Inc.

25:28.500 --> 25:31.500
I'm gonna watch though. I have questions.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.250
Zarthax, I hope
you'll accept these as an apology.

25:37.333 --> 25:39.916
They might be helpful
till your real ones grow back.

25:40.916 --> 25:43.000
Well, these will do nicely.

25:43.083 --> 25:45.541
What do you say, J.R.? Ready to re-up?

25:45.625 --> 25:47.541
Really? After all this?

25:47.625 --> 25:48.791
Business is business.

25:48.875 --> 25:51.875
We were hoping you'd found an upgrade
since Rand's departure,

25:51.958 --> 25:54.666
and as far as we can tell, you have.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.875
Maybe physical boundaries are good.
Maybe no one should touch each other ever.

26:02.958 --> 26:03.958
Want a ride, kiddo?

26:04.791 --> 26:06.250
Yeah, I'll take a ride.

26:07.541 --> 26:09.833
Hey, Dad, I just wanted to say…

26:09.916 --> 26:11.750
…I tolerate you.

26:12.250 --> 26:14.041
I tolerate you too, kiddo.

26:14.625 --> 26:17.625
-So, one question.
-Please don't ask me if you're a good dad.

26:17.708 --> 26:20.458
Eh? I was gonna ask
if you think I could pull off a goatee.

26:20.541 --> 26:21.791
Of course I'm a good dad.

26:21.875 --> 26:24.000
-I just saved your ass.
-No, I saved my ass.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.541
-Okay, well…
-Is anyone taping this?

26:26.625 --> 26:29.000
Just kidding. I am.

26:29.666 --> 26:33.000
I'm sorry, sir,
but you tested positive for iguanarrhea.

26:33.083 --> 26:35.083
-Motherfucker!
-I wasn't done.

26:35.166 --> 26:38.375
Iguanarrhea, clawmydia, sssyphilis,

26:38.458 --> 26:41.458
scalebies, explosive cloaca disease.

26:41.541 --> 26:42.791
Oh yeah, and mushroom herpes.

26:42.875 --> 26:44.458
Wait. What was that last one?
