WEBVTT

00:01.795 --> 00:03.713
We were born in space.

00:03.922 --> 00:05.924
They told us the ground
was uninhabited,

00:06.132 --> 00:08.802
but they were wrong, and we've
been fighting for our lives

00:09.010 --> 00:11.346
since the moment we landed.

00:11.554 --> 00:14.474
Some of us have been
broken by it,

00:14.683 --> 00:16.476
but most of us are still here

00:16.685 --> 00:18.853
searching for other
survivors from the ark,

00:19.062 --> 00:21.106
trying to build something
real and lasting

00:21.314 --> 00:23.608
out of the wilderness--
a home.

00:23.817 --> 00:25.193
Our leaders believe
that to survive,

00:25.402 --> 00:27.904
we need to make peace
with the grounders,

00:28.113 --> 00:32.075
but peace is
a foreign concept here.

00:32.283 --> 00:33.994
The reason for this
summit has changed.

00:34.202 --> 00:36.871
We are not here to negotiate
a treaty with the Skaikru,

00:37.080 --> 00:38.790
but rather to
initiate them

00:38.999 --> 00:39.916
into the coalition.

00:40.125 --> 00:41.126
Nngh!

00:41.334 --> 00:42.711
Moving people
into mount weather

00:42.919 --> 00:45.547
puts our entire
agenda at risk.

00:47.799 --> 00:49.300
- Aah!
- Aah!

00:49.509 --> 00:50.468
Uh!

00:50.677 --> 00:52.846
The grounders attacked
mount weather.

00:53.054 --> 00:57.392
The ice nation did
what Lexa was too weak to do.

01:05.442 --> 01:07.736
Ambassadors
of the coalition,

01:07.944 --> 01:10.530
today we honor our covenant.

01:10.739 --> 01:13.366
The clan that stands
against one of us

01:13.575 --> 01:16.244
stands against us all.

01:35.847 --> 01:38.016
Queen Nia
of Azgeda has confessed

01:38.224 --> 01:39.893
to the destruction
of mount weather

01:40.101 --> 01:43.354
resulting in the death
of 49 members of Skaikru.

01:43.563 --> 01:46.483
Wanheda,
what say you?

01:47.859 --> 01:50.737
Skaikru demands justice.

01:56.367 --> 01:59.829
The punishment for
your crime is death.

02:00.038 --> 02:01.623
Do you have anything
to say in your defense?

02:01.831 --> 02:05.168
I need no defense.
She does.

02:05.376 --> 02:08.213
Today is
judgment day.

02:08.421 --> 02:12.258
I call for a vote
of no confidence.

02:13.885 --> 02:16.471
Take this queen
to meet her fate.

02:21.935 --> 02:23.728
Take them away, too!

02:27.398 --> 02:28.358
Lexa, please execute
these traitors--

02:28.566 --> 02:30.610
let her make
her move.

02:35.448 --> 02:36.699
Commander,
what is this?

02:36.908 --> 02:38.409
This is a coup.

02:38.618 --> 02:41.454
This is the law,
her law--

02:41.663 --> 02:44.207
a unanimous vote
of the ambassadors

02:44.415 --> 02:46.501
or death are all
that can remove

02:46.709 --> 02:48.419
a commander
from power.

02:48.628 --> 02:50.672
It's not unanimous.

02:50.880 --> 02:54.634
We don't recognize the
legitimacy of Skaikru.

02:54.843 --> 02:56.970
We do.

02:57.178 --> 02:59.681
Yesterday Skaikru
took the brand.

02:59.889 --> 03:02.392
They are
the 13th clan.

03:02.600 --> 03:05.145
This vote of
no confidence fails.

03:05.353 --> 03:07.522
All these coup plotters
will suffer

03:07.730 --> 03:10.316
the exact same fate
as the ice queen.

03:12.068 --> 03:13.945
She won't take our heads
because she knows

03:14.154 --> 03:17.740
our armies
will retaliate.

03:17.949 --> 03:21.411
None of us here
wants war.

03:21.619 --> 03:25.165
We both know
what you want, Nia.

03:28.668 --> 03:32.130
If you think me
unfit to command,

03:32.338 --> 03:35.300
issue the challenge
and let's get on with it.

03:35.508 --> 03:39.095
Very well.
You are challenged.

03:39.304 --> 03:41.139
And I accept
your challenge.

03:44.517 --> 03:46.227
So be it.

03:47.729 --> 03:51.065
Warrior against warrior
to the death.

03:52.692 --> 03:54.861
Queen Nia of Azgeda,

03:55.069 --> 03:57.030
who do you choose
to be your champion?

03:57.238 --> 04:01.701
My son roan,
prince of Azgeda.

04:04.746 --> 04:07.540
Heda, who will
fight for you?

05:16.734 --> 05:19.612
Best we can tell,
mount weather was destroyed

05:19.821 --> 05:22.490
by an internal
self-destruct mechanism.

05:22.699 --> 05:23.992
It worked
as designed.

05:24.200 --> 05:26.452
49 of our citizens
were lost.

05:26.661 --> 05:28.079
So when do we
strike back?

05:28.288 --> 05:29.539
We don't.

05:30.206 --> 05:32.166
The ice nation took
credit for the attack,

05:32.375 --> 05:34.335
and the commander
will bring them to justice.

05:34.544 --> 05:36.879
So now we're
trusting grounders

05:37.088 --> 05:38.339
to punish grounders?

05:38.548 --> 05:40.633
Now, I'm sorry,
madam chancellor,

05:40.842 --> 05:42.927
but I lost
more than half

05:43.136 --> 05:45.054
of my remaining
people yesterday

05:45.263 --> 05:47.390
and 4 times that many
since we landed.

05:47.598 --> 05:49.600
Now, in my experience,
grounders understand

05:49.809 --> 05:51.269
one thing--strength.

05:51.477 --> 05:53.104
It's simple.

05:53.313 --> 05:54.772
We need to hit them now.

05:54.981 --> 05:57.775
We need to hit them hard,
leave no survivors.

05:57.984 --> 06:00.278
There's nothing
simple about this.

06:00.486 --> 06:02.238
This attack
by the ice nation

06:02.447 --> 06:04.407
was against Lexa,
not us.

06:04.615 --> 06:05.992
Are you saying this
isn't our fight?

06:06.409 --> 06:07.702
I'm saying we were
collateral damage

06:07.910 --> 06:09.078
in someone else's war.

06:09.287 --> 06:11.706
But it's not someone
else's war anymore.

06:12.707 --> 06:14.334
Look. If we don't
defend ourselves,

06:14.542 --> 06:15.668
they will take
what we have.

06:15.877 --> 06:19.797
That's what they do.
Mark my words.

06:20.006 --> 06:22.216
The grounders
are coming for us.

06:22.425 --> 06:25.678
We'll take it
under advisement.

06:25.887 --> 06:28.639
Meeting adjourned.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.486
After the election
tomorrow,

06:41.694 --> 06:43.654
he's your problem.

06:52.622 --> 06:54.248
Sir--

06:54.457 --> 06:56.918
why aren't you
at your post?

07:03.674 --> 07:07.178
Don't do this.

07:07.387 --> 07:10.598
49 of the people
I swore to protect

07:10.807 --> 07:12.600
died yesterday
because I left.

07:12.809 --> 07:15.436
That's not
your fault, Bellamy.

07:15.645 --> 07:19.315
Place the blame
where it belongs,

07:19.524 --> 07:20.608
on the ice nation.

07:20.817 --> 07:23.694
Ice nation didn't tell
Gina to stay there.

07:23.903 --> 07:27.156
That was me.

07:30.326 --> 07:32.203
Given the information
you had at the time,

07:32.412 --> 07:35.123
you made
a reasonable choice.

07:35.331 --> 07:37.208
You were trying
to save lives.

07:39.752 --> 07:42.338
But I didn't.

07:57.937 --> 08:00.148
Jasper, Jasper--

08:00.356 --> 08:01.732
get away from me.

08:01.941 --> 08:04.026
Hey...

08:04.235 --> 08:05.653
Jasper,
what's wrong?

08:05.862 --> 08:07.196
He's not going
to the memorial.

08:07.405 --> 08:08.614
It's a little late
for a mount weather

08:08.823 --> 08:10.950
memorial,
don't you think?

08:11.159 --> 08:12.910
All Arkadia
security personnel,

08:13.119 --> 08:13.911
report to main gate.

08:14.120 --> 08:15.246
What now?

08:15.455 --> 08:16.539
All Arkadia
security personnel,

08:16.747 --> 08:18.583
report to the main gate.

08:21.169 --> 08:22.879
Nyko.

08:24.755 --> 08:26.966
No weapons.

08:27.175 --> 08:28.968
Everybody, check him.

08:32.597 --> 08:34.348
- Uh!
- Hey!

08:34.557 --> 08:36.142
Leave them alone.
They're sick.

08:36.350 --> 08:39.979
Hey, hey, hey,
that's enough. Stop it.

08:41.439 --> 08:43.107
The chancellor told Nyko
that we would help.

08:43.316 --> 08:45.610
You're one of them.
You take them in.

08:50.239 --> 08:52.950
I got him.
Come on.

08:57.413 --> 08:59.457
I heard about
mount weather.

08:59.665 --> 09:02.418
I'm very sorry.

09:06.214 --> 09:07.465
Uh!

09:07.673 --> 09:10.092
Jasper, camp's in lockdown.
What are you doing?

09:10.301 --> 09:13.429
Uh! Go to your
memorial, Monty.

09:13.638 --> 09:15.848
- Maybe I will.
- Maybe you should.

09:16.057 --> 09:18.392
- Fine.
- Good.

09:37.870 --> 09:40.164
Talk her
out of it yet?

09:40.373 --> 09:44.961
No, but maybe
you can.

09:45.169 --> 09:47.213
I don't understand.

09:47.421 --> 09:49.590
The queen's not fighting.
Why should she?

09:49.799 --> 09:52.343
The queen's strength
is not in doubt.

09:52.552 --> 09:55.805
Thanks to you,
Heda's is.

10:09.735 --> 10:12.154
Aden, stay.

10:13.698 --> 10:16.450
Clarke,
this is Aden.

10:16.617 --> 10:17.868
Aden is the most
promising

10:18.077 --> 10:19.203
of my novitiates.

10:19.412 --> 10:20.705
If I should
die today,

10:20.913 --> 10:23.874
he will likely
succeed me.

10:24.083 --> 10:27.003
Clarke worries
about our people.

10:27.211 --> 10:28.254
Tell her what
will happen to them

10:28.462 --> 10:30.840
when you become
Heda, Aden.

10:31.048 --> 10:33.384
If I become Heda,

10:33.593 --> 10:37.346
I pledge my loyalty
to the 13th clan.

10:37.555 --> 10:40.558
Thank you. Now go
join the others.

10:46.105 --> 10:49.817
See? Nothing
to worry about.

10:49.984 --> 10:52.278
I'm sorry if I'm worried
the fate of my people

10:52.486 --> 10:54.196
lies in the hands
of a child.

10:54.405 --> 10:55.656
Then you worry
for nothing.

10:55.865 --> 10:57.074
I've sent Indra
to raise an army

10:57.283 --> 10:59.243
from the villages
near Arkadia.

10:59.452 --> 11:00.786
Your people
are protected,

11:00.995 --> 11:02.079
as I vowed
they would be.

11:02.288 --> 11:05.291
This is not just
about my people.

11:05.499 --> 11:07.668
You don't stand a chance
against roan.

11:07.877 --> 11:09.253
You've never
seen me fight.

11:09.462 --> 11:11.964
No, but I saw him kill
3 men in the time it took

11:12.173 --> 11:13.549
the first one
to hit the ground.

11:13.758 --> 11:15.676
If you're right,
today's the day

11:15.885 --> 11:17.803
my spirit will choose
its successor,

11:18.012 --> 11:20.222
and you need
to accept that.

11:20.431 --> 11:22.600
Like hell I do.

11:36.614 --> 11:38.115
Focus, roan.
You're here to practice.

11:38.324 --> 11:41.410
Remember, anticipate
her reflexes.

11:41.619 --> 11:43.037
When you feel
overconfident,

11:43.245 --> 11:44.997
you forget that your enemy
has strengths, too.

11:45.206 --> 11:47.333
I don't need
your help.

11:47.541 --> 11:49.543
You're upset
that I chose you.

11:49.752 --> 11:52.004
I'm not surprised.

11:52.213 --> 11:53.547
When you kill Lexa,

11:53.756 --> 11:55.466
your banishment
will be over.

11:55.675 --> 11:57.635
In the wake of your victory,
our people will be

11:57.843 --> 12:00.012
more powerful
than ever.

12:00.221 --> 12:03.140
That will be your legacy
and your legend.

12:03.349 --> 12:06.102
Don't pretend you do
anything for me, mother.

12:07.436 --> 12:09.230
You're right.

12:09.438 --> 12:12.441
Everything I do
is for Azgeda.

12:12.650 --> 12:16.153
What's good for Azgeda
is good for you.

12:16.362 --> 12:18.572
My sword.

12:27.248 --> 12:29.500
If you won't fight
for your mother

12:29.709 --> 12:34.547
or your queen,
fight for your clan.

12:36.799 --> 12:39.135
I want her head.

12:47.184 --> 12:48.978
Hah.

12:50.813 --> 12:53.607
Huh! Is that death I
hear stalking me...

12:55.317 --> 12:56.902
Or just the
commander of death?

12:57.111 --> 12:58.279
We need to talk.

12:58.446 --> 13:00.865
We have nothing
to talk about.

13:01.073 --> 13:02.700
I need to prepare.

13:02.908 --> 13:04.910
I know you had nothing
to do with mount weather.

13:05.119 --> 13:07.204
That's why I didn't tell Lexa
you gave me the knife.

13:07.413 --> 13:09.915
This is what your mother
wanted all along.

13:10.124 --> 13:12.626
What do you want?
Spit it out.

13:12.835 --> 13:15.212
I want you
to become the king.

13:16.505 --> 13:19.508
I know you've
thought of it.

13:19.717 --> 13:22.720
She was willing
to let you die,

13:22.928 --> 13:25.306
willing to let you
be banished.

13:25.514 --> 13:27.224
I know you just
want to go home.

13:27.433 --> 13:28.726
When I win today,
I will.

13:28.934 --> 13:31.020
For how long?

13:31.228 --> 13:33.355
How long until your mother
finds another reason

13:33.564 --> 13:36.317
to cast you out,
to sacrifice you?

13:38.569 --> 13:41.155
No one can cast a king
out of his kingdom.

13:42.239 --> 13:44.241
I can't do it--

13:44.450 --> 13:46.786
my people would
never take me back--

13:51.916 --> 13:53.501
but...

13:56.086 --> 13:58.756
I can help you do it.

14:02.343 --> 14:05.888
All that's certain
is that we die.

14:06.096 --> 14:09.892
How we die is up to us.

14:10.100 --> 14:13.145
Who will speak
for iris Jones?

14:20.528 --> 14:25.199
Iris was strong,
good with a knife.

14:25.407 --> 14:28.285
She saved my life.

14:28.494 --> 14:30.704
I'm just sorry I couldn't
do the same for her.

14:41.298 --> 14:45.261
We will miss iris.
May we meet again.

14:45.469 --> 14:46.846
May we meet again.

14:47.054 --> 14:49.098
Who will speak
for Gina Martin?

15:01.402 --> 15:03.529
Gina was real.

15:03.737 --> 15:06.907
She always saw the light,
even here.

15:09.994 --> 15:13.247
She deserved better.

15:13.455 --> 15:15.416
May we meet again.

15:19.837 --> 15:21.297
Just came in.

15:21.505 --> 15:23.841
We saw a whole
encampment, 300 strong,

15:24.049 --> 15:26.302
just behind
the tree Ridge.

15:26.510 --> 15:28.345
There's a bunch of them.
It's grounders.

15:28.554 --> 15:30.347
They're coming.

15:32.057 --> 15:35.853
Grounders are here,
an army 300 strong

15:36.061 --> 15:37.730
camped less
than a mile from here.

15:37.938 --> 15:39.356
- We know.
- What?

15:39.565 --> 15:40.858
Indra radioed.

15:41.066 --> 15:43.193
You gave a grounder
one of our radios?

15:46.280 --> 15:49.366
Sir, are
we under attack?

15:49.575 --> 15:51.827
No.
We are not under attack.

15:52.036 --> 15:54.496
The commander sent
a peacekeeping force

15:54.705 --> 15:56.916
to ensure that we can defend
against any further attacks

15:57.124 --> 15:58.459
from the ice nation.

15:58.626 --> 15:59.919
Peacekeeping
force?

16:00.127 --> 16:02.212
Even you can't be
that naive, Marcus.

16:02.421 --> 16:03.422
Watch your tongue.

16:03.631 --> 16:05.841
You're talking to
the next chancellor.

16:06.050 --> 16:08.177
We're all grieving.

16:08.385 --> 16:10.930
This has been hard
on all of us,

16:11.138 --> 16:13.307
but we can't let anger
drive our policy.

16:13.515 --> 16:15.851
Anger is our policy.

16:16.060 --> 16:17.978
- Yeah.
- You bet.

16:18.187 --> 16:21.440
Now, if they're here
to defend us, as you say,

16:21.649 --> 16:24.568
then tell them
to go home.

16:24.777 --> 16:27.029
We can defend ourselves.

16:27.237 --> 16:30.199
- Right. Yeah.
- Right.

16:30.407 --> 16:33.619
You, you don't
belong here.

16:33.827 --> 16:35.120
- He's one of them.
- Yeah.

16:35.329 --> 16:37.539
- Go on. Get out.
- Right.

16:37.748 --> 16:39.625
My boy is dead!

16:43.337 --> 16:45.673
- Back off!
- Arrest him.

16:45.881 --> 16:47.049
Stop!

16:49.510 --> 16:51.804
- Hey!
- Break it up.

16:52.012 --> 16:55.849
We do not
attack our own.

16:56.058 --> 16:59.186
Fighting each other
only makes us weak.

16:59.395 --> 17:02.690
The enemy
is not in this camp.

17:02.898 --> 17:05.776
The enemy is out there.

17:08.278 --> 17:10.614
Lincoln,
are you OK?

17:10.823 --> 17:12.700
I'm fine.

17:12.908 --> 17:15.369
Lincoln, you need
to go to medical.

17:23.377 --> 17:25.671
Ugh!

17:31.260 --> 17:33.971
Rrgh...Uh! Uh!

17:48.610 --> 17:50.029
Nngh...

18:07.379 --> 18:10.257
What the hell are we
doing here, Jasper?

18:10.424 --> 18:13.010
Visiting old friends.

18:28.650 --> 18:30.861
I think you've
had enough.

18:31.070 --> 18:33.614
You have no idea.

18:33.781 --> 18:36.492
Time to give
some back.

19:15.989 --> 19:18.325
Tell me this
isn't what I--

19:41.390 --> 19:44.852
no. No charges.

19:45.060 --> 19:46.728
Lincoln, we need
to set an example.

19:46.937 --> 19:48.438
Yeah.
We do.

19:48.647 --> 19:50.524
The man just lost
his son, Marcus.

19:50.732 --> 19:53.443
Lincoln
didn't do that.

19:53.652 --> 19:54.611
What happened?

19:54.820 --> 19:56.113
I said,
no charges.

19:56.321 --> 19:58.323
Thank you.

20:06.331 --> 20:08.667
He'll be fine.

20:12.379 --> 20:13.881
Oh...

20:15.257 --> 20:17.134
Was it farm station?

20:17.342 --> 20:19.011
Doesn't matter.

20:19.219 --> 20:21.346
Indra's army's
outside the wall,

20:21.555 --> 20:23.640
and Lexa lifted the kill
order on you at the summit.

20:23.849 --> 20:27.352
Maybe she'll take us back.
We can get out of here.

20:27.561 --> 20:29.938
The only way they're
ever gonna see us

20:30.147 --> 20:33.692
as different from Azgeda
is if I stay.

20:33.901 --> 20:36.361
Lincoln,
you OK to translate?

20:36.570 --> 20:39.364
Nyko's got his hands full.

20:41.116 --> 20:43.702
Octavia...

20:45.996 --> 20:47.456
It'll pass.

21:17.277 --> 21:19.488
To what do I owe
the pleasure?

21:19.696 --> 21:22.491
What if I changed
my vote?

21:24.743 --> 21:28.747
Now you're thinking like
a leader of your people.

21:28.956 --> 21:32.459
I would need
so assurances first.

21:32.668 --> 21:34.544
Skaikru
will be safe.

21:34.753 --> 21:36.171
And me?

21:36.380 --> 21:39.967
My quarrel is
with Lexa, not you.

21:41.093 --> 21:42.844
Once she's gone,

21:43.053 --> 21:45.681
I won't need the
power of Wanheda.

21:45.889 --> 21:47.641
- OK.
- "OK"?

21:47.849 --> 21:50.227
You don't want vengeance for
the dead at mount weather?

21:50.435 --> 21:52.604
My priority
is with the living,

21:52.813 --> 21:54.731
not the dead.

22:02.531 --> 22:04.032
Uh...

22:05.200 --> 22:07.244
I see you've
learned our oath.

22:15.419 --> 22:17.212
Do you accept?

22:36.690 --> 22:39.359
Could've been
allies, Clarke.

22:39.568 --> 22:41.570
Instead, I declare you
and your people

22:41.778 --> 22:44.573
enemies of Azgeda.

22:44.781 --> 22:47.326
Ontari,
hold out your hand.

22:51.204 --> 22:56.460
I'm letting you live for now
to send a message to Lexa.

22:59.880 --> 23:01.882
I have my own Natblida...

23:03.216 --> 23:06.678
And she will be
the next commander.

23:18.273 --> 23:21.109
A commander
from the ice nation?

23:21.318 --> 23:23.737
Now all of Nia's
provocations make sense,

23:23.945 --> 23:25.530
and we played
right into it.

23:25.739 --> 23:27.157
She knew you would
accept her challenge.

23:27.366 --> 23:29.368
I've never seen blood
that color before.

23:29.576 --> 23:31.787
Goes back to
the first commander.

23:31.995 --> 23:33.330
When a nightblood
child is found,

23:33.538 --> 23:35.207
they're brought here
to be trained,

23:35.415 --> 23:36.625
or supposed to be.

23:36.833 --> 23:38.251
Your legacy
is no longer secure.

23:38.460 --> 23:39.795
There is still time
to choose a champion.

23:40.003 --> 23:41.546
You know
I can't do that.

23:41.755 --> 23:44.216
- Heda--
- leave us!

23:48.762 --> 23:50.639
Titus is right.

23:50.847 --> 23:52.849
You're giving her
exactly what she wants.

23:53.058 --> 23:55.894
Only if I lose.

23:56.103 --> 23:58.480
I know you're just
trying to help, Clarke,

23:58.688 --> 24:00.399
but there's nothing
you can do here.

24:00.607 --> 24:02.776
I can't just let
roan kill you.

24:02.984 --> 24:05.112
If that is to be
my fate, you must.

24:05.320 --> 24:07.781
You're driven to fix
everything for everyone,

24:07.989 --> 24:10.367
but you can't
fix this.

24:10.575 --> 24:12.786
I have to do this
on my own,

24:12.994 --> 24:14.496
and you
have to let me.

24:14.704 --> 24:17.666
I won't just sit there
and watch you die.

24:21.336 --> 24:23.338
Heda...

24:26.925 --> 24:30.637
Then this
is good-bye...

24:30.804 --> 24:32.055
For now.

24:42.732 --> 24:44.484
Exit is secure.

24:44.693 --> 24:47.195
Let's talk
about mount weather.

24:49.281 --> 24:51.283
I know you think
it was your fault.

24:52.993 --> 24:54.870
That why you resigned?

25:04.379 --> 25:06.840
You're right.
It was your fault...

25:09.217 --> 25:10.719
Mine, too.

25:12.137 --> 25:14.764
Every life we honored
at the memorial

25:14.973 --> 25:17.809
was lost because
we trusted a grounder.

25:18.018 --> 25:19.519
I talked you
into it.

25:19.728 --> 25:21.480
I knew her, and
I vouched for her.

25:21.688 --> 25:24.441
No. You don't get
to own this one alone.

25:30.113 --> 25:32.532
I knew what they
were capable of,

25:32.741 --> 25:35.202
but I let my guard
down one day,

25:35.410 --> 25:38.747
and 35 of
my people died.

25:43.376 --> 25:45.253
Never again.

25:47.255 --> 25:49.132
Never again.

25:57.349 --> 26:00.519
Kane's a good man--
I know you're close to him--

26:00.727 --> 26:04.397
but he doesn't believe
that we're fighting a war.

26:04.606 --> 26:07.108
He thinks grounders
can police grounders.

26:07.317 --> 26:08.777
I mean, out there
in the woods

26:08.985 --> 26:13.240
outside our home with
a peacekeeping force?

26:14.866 --> 26:16.493
What would you do?

26:16.701 --> 26:18.620
What I wouldn't do...

26:20.580 --> 26:22.791
Is wait for them
to hit us.

26:26.545 --> 26:28.630
My scouts tell me
that they've got

26:28.838 --> 26:34.010
300 soldiers and not
a single gun between them.

26:34.219 --> 26:38.515
10 highly motivated men
with automatic rifles

26:38.723 --> 26:41.560
is all it would take.

26:41.768 --> 26:44.020
I've got the men.

26:48.483 --> 26:52.404
You're asking me
to get you the guns.

26:52.612 --> 26:55.407
- That's treason.
- That's survival.

26:55.615 --> 26:59.286
The grounders out there
will attack this camp,

26:59.494 --> 27:01.246
and our leaders
do nothing.

27:01.454 --> 27:03.498
Right now, we have
the element of surprise.

27:03.707 --> 27:06.084
We wait, we die.

27:06.293 --> 27:08.169
If they want
to call it treason,

27:08.378 --> 27:10.964
I'm willing to suffer
the consequences

27:11.172 --> 27:13.883
to save our people.

27:14.092 --> 27:16.553
Are you?

27:33.403 --> 27:35.071
Heda!

27:35.280 --> 27:36.990
Heda, Heda!

28:25.497 --> 28:27.624
I'm glad you came.

28:28.833 --> 28:30.251
Me, too.

28:44.933 --> 28:46.685
Uh! Huh!

28:46.893 --> 28:48.728
Uh! Aah!

28:50.397 --> 28:51.773
You're done.

28:56.444 --> 28:58.530
Uh...Huh!

28:58.738 --> 29:00.657
Huh! Huh! Uh!

29:00.865 --> 29:02.283
Uh! Oh!

29:02.492 --> 29:03.868
Huh! Huh!

29:04.077 --> 29:05.370
Huh!

29:05.578 --> 29:07.205
Ah!

29:14.421 --> 29:15.255
Uh!

29:15.463 --> 29:16.339
Oh!

29:20.385 --> 29:22.345
Yah! Uh!

29:22.554 --> 29:24.264
Rragh!

29:24.431 --> 29:26.766
- Uh!
- Uh!

29:26.975 --> 29:28.560
Hah!

29:59.966 --> 30:01.050
Raagh!

30:02.510 --> 30:03.303
Hah!

30:03.511 --> 30:05.638
Huh! Uh!

30:05.847 --> 30:07.098
Uh!

30:12.520 --> 30:14.230
Hah!

30:14.439 --> 30:15.607
Uh!

30:15.815 --> 30:19.194
Oh...Uh!

30:20.487 --> 30:21.946
Uh!

30:38.755 --> 30:40.840
Get it over with.

30:46.262 --> 30:47.597
Uh!

31:06.407 --> 31:08.618
The queen is dead.

31:11.579 --> 31:13.706
Long live the king.

31:13.915 --> 31:15.959
Long live the king!

31:18.753 --> 31:21.840
Heda! Heda! Heda! Heda!

31:22.048 --> 31:25.510
Heda! Heda!
Heda! Heda!

31:25.718 --> 31:29.138
Heda! Heda! Heda! Heda!

31:29.347 --> 31:32.308
Heda! Heda! Heda!

31:43.111 --> 31:45.446
It's time.

32:02.547 --> 32:04.799
You need to step
aside right now.

32:05.008 --> 32:06.092
What are the guns for?

32:06.259 --> 32:07.510
There's an army
out there.

32:07.719 --> 32:09.220
We need to hit them
before they hit us.

32:09.429 --> 32:11.764
That army was sent
to protect us.

32:11.973 --> 32:13.725
Do we have
a problem?

32:13.933 --> 32:17.312
No. I have always done
what is best for us.

32:17.520 --> 32:21.316
I need you to trust
that I'm doing that now.

32:21.524 --> 32:23.902
Monroe.

32:29.157 --> 32:31.159
Harper.

32:31.367 --> 32:33.286
Sorry, Lincoln.

32:34.412 --> 32:36.331
You, too, Lincoln.

32:36.539 --> 32:39.292
You want to prove
you're one of us,

32:39.500 --> 32:42.003
let us pass.

32:43.838 --> 32:46.049
I'm not moving.

32:46.257 --> 32:47.634
Get out of the way,
grounder.

32:47.842 --> 32:50.094
Oh! Ugh!

32:50.303 --> 32:52.513
Put guns down.
Guns down!

32:52.722 --> 32:55.350
Do what
he says now.

32:55.558 --> 32:57.226
So much for
the good grounder.

32:57.435 --> 32:59.437
Quiet, Hannah.

32:59.646 --> 33:01.731
Whose people are you
defending here, Lincoln?

33:01.940 --> 33:04.359
Lincoln, put down the knife.
No one has to get hurt here.

33:04.567 --> 33:05.902
Can't let you
start a war.

33:06.110 --> 33:07.946
We're already
at war.

33:08.154 --> 33:10.239
You can't stop this.

33:10.448 --> 33:12.867
All Arkadia
security personnel,

33:13.076 --> 33:15.870
report to the main gate.

33:16.079 --> 33:19.999
All Arkadia security personnel,
report to main gate now.

33:20.208 --> 33:22.043
What's wrong
with you?

33:22.251 --> 33:26.631
Move off here. Let's go.
Clear the area.

33:26.839 --> 33:28.299
Calm down, people.

33:28.508 --> 33:31.094
Farm station, guns
on the ground, on the ground.

33:31.302 --> 33:33.471
Lincoln, it's all right.
Let him go.

33:33.680 --> 33:35.306
Nngh!

33:37.183 --> 33:38.935
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

33:39.143 --> 33:41.229
What you didn't
have the guts to.

33:41.437 --> 33:43.398
Did you arm
these people?

33:47.235 --> 33:50.446
Guards, take them
to lockup now.

33:50.655 --> 33:52.699
What is she doing?
What is this?

33:52.907 --> 33:55.618
Come on.
How can you do this?

33:55.827 --> 33:58.413
Everybody, back
to your quarters.

33:58.621 --> 34:02.041
- It's over.
- Nothing is over.

34:02.250 --> 34:05.461
We are surrounded by
warriors who want us dead.

34:05.670 --> 34:08.506
- That's enough.
- No. It isn't, not even close.

34:08.715 --> 34:10.174
Why don't you
show us all

34:10.383 --> 34:13.052
what you let the grounders
do to you yesterday?

34:13.261 --> 34:14.554
Come on, Kane.

34:14.721 --> 34:16.305
I think that the people
who are about

34:16.514 --> 34:19.642
to vote for you
have a right to know.

34:19.851 --> 34:21.394
We do.

34:21.602 --> 34:23.396
Show us, Kane.

34:29.944 --> 34:33.740
It's the mark
of the commander's coalition.

34:33.948 --> 34:37.243
It means we
are the 13th clan.

34:37.452 --> 34:39.537
It means we are in
this fight together.

34:39.746 --> 34:44.000
No. It's what farmers used
to do to their livestock.

34:44.208 --> 34:46.127
Right before
the slaughterhouse.

34:46.335 --> 34:47.920
You bet.
I ain't no grounder.

34:48.087 --> 34:49.714
Pike for chancellor!

34:49.922 --> 34:53.301
Sir, you should be
on the ballot tomorrow.

34:53.509 --> 34:57.346
That's enough.

34:57.555 --> 35:00.516
Take him away.

35:00.725 --> 35:03.728
Pike! Pike!

35:03.936 --> 35:06.481
Pike! Pike!

35:06.689 --> 35:10.234
Pike! Pike! Pike!

35:10.443 --> 35:14.947
Pike! Pike!
Pike! Pike!

35:15.156 --> 35:19.535
Pike! Pike! Pike! Pike! Pike!

35:24.290 --> 35:26.626
Mm...

35:26.834 --> 35:28.586
Uh...Ugh...

35:28.795 --> 35:30.046
Hmm.

35:30.254 --> 35:32.423
What the hell
were you thinking?

35:33.841 --> 35:35.551
Home sweet home.

35:35.760 --> 35:37.762
Does Abby know
you took these?

35:37.970 --> 35:40.640
Uh...

35:40.848 --> 35:44.102
Since I stole them,
probably not.

35:46.604 --> 35:48.314
It's Memorial Day,
all right?

35:48.523 --> 35:51.651
Let's, uh, scatter them
with the others.

35:51.859 --> 35:54.821
Finn's ashes aren't
yours to scatter.

35:55.029 --> 35:56.531
What about raven?

35:56.739 --> 35:58.157
Besides, if Abby
still has them,

35:58.366 --> 36:00.701
it means she's
saving them for Clarke.

36:00.910 --> 36:03.830
Who cares who
it hurts, right?

36:04.038 --> 36:06.207
Yeah, whatever Jasper wants,
and screw the rest of us.

36:06.415 --> 36:09.585
No. No.
Screw Clarke.

36:09.794 --> 36:11.504
You are both

36:11.712 --> 36:15.049
mass murderers,
as far as I'm concerned.

36:17.927 --> 36:21.055
I get why she did it

36:21.264 --> 36:24.475
and why Bellamy
helped her, but you--

36:24.684 --> 36:27.270
Maya was your friend.
She was my--

36:28.521 --> 36:31.065
how is it that you

36:31.274 --> 36:33.568
can wipe out
an entire civilization,

36:33.776 --> 36:35.361
yet I'm the one that
can't sleep at night?

36:35.570 --> 36:37.071
How--how can you
just be fine?

36:37.280 --> 36:39.115
I'm not fine!

36:39.323 --> 36:40.867
Just because I'm not
drinking myself

36:41.075 --> 36:42.034
into a stupor
every night

36:42.243 --> 36:44.328
doesn't mean
I'm not screwed up,

36:44.537 --> 36:45.913
but we had
no other choice.

36:46.122 --> 36:49.292
Ha ha ha!

36:49.500 --> 36:52.587
You hear that, Finn?
He thinks he's innocent.

36:52.795 --> 36:55.923
- None of us is innocent.
- OK. Float you!

36:57.758 --> 36:59.427
For 3 months,

36:59.635 --> 37:01.596
I've watched you
torture yourself

37:01.804 --> 37:04.265
and everyone
around you, mostly me,

37:04.473 --> 37:06.726
but I'm done being
your punching bag.

37:06.934 --> 37:08.102
Either you pull
yourself together

37:08.311 --> 37:09.770
and get on
with your life,

37:09.979 --> 37:12.565
or you fall apart
alone.

37:12.773 --> 37:15.151
Are you done?

37:16.527 --> 37:19.280
I miss
my best friend.

37:19.488 --> 37:22.450
He died
that day, too.

37:30.208 --> 37:32.585
You're leaving?

37:41.052 --> 37:42.929
See you on the other side!

37:49.477 --> 37:51.354
Oh, God...

37:53.689 --> 37:55.191
Oh...

37:58.694 --> 37:59.695
Oh...

38:06.827 --> 38:09.288
Oh...

38:28.474 --> 38:30.601
Is this
"I told you so"?

38:30.810 --> 38:33.479
No. This is
"thank you."

38:35.690 --> 38:37.566
Come in.

38:42.446 --> 38:44.490
Sit down. Let me
change that for you.

38:55.042 --> 38:58.963
That girl
that was with Nia,

38:59.171 --> 39:02.633
Ontari, what will
happen to her?

39:06.512 --> 39:09.890
She won't be back until
the conclave after my death.

39:10.099 --> 39:11.934
Do you ever talk
about anything

39:12.143 --> 39:14.312
other than
your death?

39:22.903 --> 39:24.989
Thank you
for backing me.

39:25.197 --> 39:28.826
I was just doing what
was right for my people.

39:33.664 --> 39:37.001
Your ambassadors
betrayed you.

39:37.209 --> 39:40.171
How do you
move forward?

39:41.422 --> 39:43.257
They were doing
what they believed

39:43.466 --> 39:45.885
was right for
their people, too.

40:00.941 --> 40:02.777
Good night,
ambassador.

40:40.856 --> 40:44.068
Congratulations,
Mr. chancellor.

40:53.494 --> 40:55.079
Where's Abby?

40:55.287 --> 40:56.622
Wishes she
could be here.

40:58.416 --> 41:00.292
The vote wasn't close.

41:00.501 --> 41:02.962
Our people are now your
responsibility, Charles.

41:03.170 --> 41:05.506
I hope you take
that seriously.

41:05.714 --> 41:08.509
Thank you, Marcus.
I certainly intend to.

41:12.346 --> 41:16.058
For my first official
action as chancellor,

41:16.267 --> 41:19.562
I pardon myself
and the others.

41:19.770 --> 41:22.314
For my second
official action,

41:22.523 --> 41:28.154
I reject the brand that
made us the 13th clan.

41:28.362 --> 41:30.197
For my third...

41:32.741 --> 41:34.702
Let's finish
what we started.

41:34.910 --> 41:37.371
Yes, sir.

41:40.499 --> 41:42.168
All right.

41:47.381 --> 41:50.468
It's not too late
to choose the right side.

41:50.676 --> 41:52.803
I already have.
