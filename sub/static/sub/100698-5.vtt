WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:01.837
Previously on Siren...

00:01.843 --> 00:03.875
The procedure went exceptionally well.

00:03.881 --> 00:05.731
I'm seeing accelerated development

00:05.737 --> 00:08.335
beyond that of a human fetus.

00:09.396 --> 00:11.676
This is an honor to have your baby.

00:11.682 --> 00:13.602
Big push.

00:29.528 --> 00:30.695
Xander's a cop?

00:30.729 --> 00:32.764
- I'm training.
- Whatever.

00:32.798 --> 00:36.034
Listen to me. I won't go back to
being a drunk-ass fisherman alone.

00:41.141 --> 00:42.774
What I thought I saw...

00:44.043 --> 00:45.610
It was real.

00:45.644 --> 00:48.112
When I saw Sarge again,

00:48.147 --> 00:51.983
he told me, "War is coming."

00:54.553 --> 00:57.989
It is here. Tia, she
wants our territory.

01:55.179 --> 01:57.481
My name is Ben Pownall.

01:57.515 --> 02:01.985
I'm a marine biologist from
Bristol Cove, Washington.

02:03.755 --> 02:06.757
I've been conducting
an ongoing experiment,

02:06.791 --> 02:09.826
using myself as a test subject.

02:09.860 --> 02:11.495
Ben.

02:11.529 --> 02:14.231
Ryn. You're back.

02:14.265 --> 02:15.666
Are you okay?

02:15.700 --> 02:16.967
Okay, yes.

02:21.939 --> 02:24.007
She likes the ocean.

02:24.042 --> 02:25.676
A good swimmer.

02:25.710 --> 02:27.444
That makes sense.

02:38.289 --> 02:40.157
What about Tia?

02:40.191 --> 02:41.525
I did not see her.

02:41.559 --> 02:44.227
She must be far away, with her tribe.

02:44.872 --> 02:46.730
The water is quiet.

02:49.233 --> 02:51.335
I was worried about you.

02:52.337 --> 02:53.637
Both of you.

03:04.310 --> 03:05.477
Yeah.

03:05.483 --> 03:07.084
Shh.

03:09.487 --> 03:10.721
Yeah.

03:10.755 --> 03:12.389
She's beautiful.

03:18.096 --> 03:19.996
Wow.

03:20.031 --> 03:22.699
That is a lot of mermaid merch.

03:22.734 --> 03:25.068
Yeah, that's my friend Helen's shop.

03:25.103 --> 03:28.138
Oh. Does Helen also own...

03:28.172 --> 03:30.040
I don't know, like a hundred cats?

03:30.074 --> 03:33.243
She's not a crazy cat lady, if
that's what you're implying.

03:33.277 --> 03:35.145
I'm not implying, I'm
straight-out accusing.

03:36.681 --> 03:38.582
So, Bristol Cove,

03:38.616 --> 03:40.217
mermaid capital of the world.

03:40.251 --> 03:41.552
Why is that?

03:41.997 --> 03:43.309
I don't know.

03:43.315 --> 03:45.717
Guess every place has to
be known for something.

03:45.723 --> 03:46.923
Oh.

03:46.958 --> 03:48.558
I like this town.

03:50.628 --> 03:52.446
What if my organization were to

03:52.452 --> 03:54.269
rent some space from the MRC?

03:54.298 --> 03:57.567
You'd move it all from San
Francisco to Bristol Cove?

03:57.602 --> 03:58.935
No, not all of it.

03:58.970 --> 04:01.338
Work would still continue down south.

04:01.372 --> 04:03.340
But the currents off the coast here

04:03.374 --> 04:05.771
would be a great testing
ground for our technology.

04:06.763 --> 04:09.579
At least that's what the big
brains on my staff tell me.

04:09.614 --> 04:12.282
And maybe I could be involved.

04:12.316 --> 04:14.284
Not maybe.

04:14.318 --> 04:15.556
Definitely.

04:15.562 --> 04:17.120
I want your help.

04:17.154 --> 04:19.428
And I imagine a hefty rent

04:19.434 --> 04:21.416
would help fund the MRC.

04:22.293 --> 04:23.560
Win-win.

04:23.594 --> 04:26.163
Yes. One sec.

04:28.566 --> 04:30.434
Oh, I'm sorry. It's my
friend who just had her baby.

04:30.468 --> 04:32.302
- Oh.
- I'd have to check with Ben,

04:32.336 --> 04:33.937
see what he thinks, but...

04:33.971 --> 04:35.405
Yeah, of course.

04:35.440 --> 04:39.309
I've got a fundraising
thing in Portland today.

04:39.343 --> 04:41.311
Would you be up for a
late dinner tonight?

04:41.345 --> 04:43.747
Yes. I'd love that.

04:43.781 --> 04:45.382
- Okay, great.
- I got to run, but...

04:45.416 --> 04:47.317
Right. Yes.

04:47.351 --> 04:49.119
- See you tonight.
- Okay.

05:04.869 --> 05:08.972
How many people are wearing glasses?

05:10.641 --> 05:12.275
Three.

05:14.846 --> 05:16.480
Yes!

05:16.514 --> 05:18.148
Sorry.

05:18.182 --> 05:22.686
Okay, how many men have beards?

05:23.544 --> 05:25.667
And are those ironic hipster beards?

05:25.763 --> 05:28.286
Oh, hey. You ready for the exam?

05:28.292 --> 05:30.789
I've never been too
good at taking tests,

05:30.795 --> 05:32.362
but sure, I guess.

05:32.396 --> 05:33.630
You?

05:33.664 --> 05:34.865
Two.

05:34.899 --> 05:36.166
What?

05:36.200 --> 05:38.368
Two men... beards.

05:38.402 --> 05:39.695
I'm impressed, McClure.

05:39.701 --> 05:41.501
You're actually showing up.

05:41.507 --> 05:42.841
Because the last thing this world needs

05:42.847 --> 05:44.581
is more drunk-ass fishermen.

05:44.587 --> 05:47.377
You heard me say that to Calvin?

05:47.411 --> 05:49.513
Power of inclusive listening.
Chapter five.

05:50.681 --> 05:52.415
See you at the exam.

05:55.820 --> 05:57.387
Ted.

05:57.421 --> 05:58.555
What brings you here?

05:58.589 --> 06:01.057
- Good morning, Helen.
- I'm very busy.

06:01.092 --> 06:02.826
Big sale today.

06:07.164 --> 06:09.199
Not at all what they're
really like, is it?

06:14.672 --> 06:17.073
I've had some time to
think about this, Helen,

06:17.108 --> 06:19.209
and I have some questions.

06:25.283 --> 06:27.484
In the story you told me,

06:27.518 --> 06:29.886
Charles Pownall and the
mermaid had a baby, okay?

06:29.921 --> 06:31.275
And that child...

06:31.281 --> 06:32.949
My great-grandmother.

06:35.726 --> 06:36.993
So you're one of them?

06:37.028 --> 06:39.062
One-eighth, to be exact.

06:39.096 --> 06:41.197
A hybrid of sorts.

06:43.327 --> 06:45.128
What does that mean for you? Physically?

06:45.530 --> 06:46.997
Well...

06:48.582 --> 06:51.151
I'm not much of a swimmer,
if that's what you're asking.

06:52.743 --> 06:53.977
What about Ryn?

06:54.784 --> 06:56.852
As pure as they come.

06:57.481 --> 06:59.449
When I saw them in the water,

06:59.483 --> 07:01.184
they were scary as hell.

07:01.218 --> 07:02.452
Aggressive.

07:02.486 --> 07:04.387
Apex predators.

07:06.390 --> 07:08.491
It's like some kind of
twisted fairy tale, isn't it?

07:10.995 --> 07:13.063
Welcome to Bristol Cove, Ted.

07:23.872 --> 07:25.206
Where's Ryn?

07:25.212 --> 07:27.232
She's putting the baby to sleep.

07:27.238 --> 07:28.939
I put baby under bed.

07:28.973 --> 07:30.337
Oh, you mean in bed.

07:30.343 --> 07:31.744
No, under.

07:32.848 --> 07:34.381
I don't think that's safe.

07:34.387 --> 07:36.355
In the ocean, we sleep in caves.

07:36.389 --> 07:37.589
She likes it.

07:37.624 --> 07:39.774
I hope you dusted under there.

07:39.780 --> 07:41.193
What is this?

07:41.227 --> 07:42.461
Have a look.

07:42.495 --> 07:44.296
We weren't sure what you needed,

07:44.330 --> 07:47.633
so we brought a collection
of the greatest hits.

07:47.667 --> 07:50.582
That's so you can carry
her close to your body.

07:50.588 --> 07:52.938
- And this?
- A diaper.

07:52.972 --> 07:55.307
Smells good.

07:55.341 --> 07:56.541
Like candy.

07:56.576 --> 07:58.310
Yeah. Not for long.

07:58.344 --> 08:00.579
You put this bit under her bottom,

08:00.613 --> 08:02.614
and then when there's pee or poo,

08:02.649 --> 08:04.216
the diaper catches it.

08:04.250 --> 08:06.118
She keeps it with her?

08:06.152 --> 08:07.552
In her clothes?

08:07.587 --> 08:09.721
Well, no, you change it.

08:11.024 --> 08:12.786
I'll tell her to use the toilet.

08:12.792 --> 08:14.788
Might be a bit young for that.

08:14.794 --> 08:16.662
She will learn.

08:16.668 --> 08:19.003
One of my best-sellers.

08:21.637 --> 08:24.272
Ryn, what made you come back so soon?

08:24.278 --> 08:25.511
Is it Tia?

08:25.967 --> 08:27.434
No.

08:27.774 --> 08:31.241
I want my baby to learn
about sea and land.

08:31.565 --> 08:32.999
To know both worlds.

08:33.479 --> 08:35.313
Like I do.

08:36.950 --> 08:39.851
I want you to show me how
to be a mother on land.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.630
Large coffee and an egg sandwich to go.

08:51.664 --> 08:54.007
- Thanks, Jodi.
- You got it, Mr. Pownall.

08:54.013 --> 08:55.647
Be about ten minutes.

08:59.005 --> 09:00.405
Patty.

09:01.708 --> 09:04.042
- Ted.
- Good to see you.

09:04.077 --> 09:05.143
Good to see you too.

09:05.178 --> 09:06.378
Have a seat.

09:07.826 --> 09:10.027
How's Elaine and the boys?

09:10.062 --> 09:11.262
Good, yeah.

09:11.296 --> 09:12.863
Yeah, everyone's good.

09:12.898 --> 09:14.932
How about you? How are you holding up?

09:14.967 --> 09:17.105
Oh, well...

09:17.111 --> 09:20.238
... just becomes one long day.

09:21.147 --> 09:23.949
And Xander, he's worried about me,

09:23.983 --> 09:26.016
so I force myself to leave the house,

09:26.022 --> 09:27.319
be social.

09:28.411 --> 09:31.147
But I find myself sitting alone,

09:31.153 --> 09:32.866
no matter where I am.

09:33.124 --> 09:35.340
Come over to our place
for dinner tonight.

09:35.346 --> 09:36.594
We'd love that.

09:38.207 --> 09:39.674
I appreciate that.

09:40.733 --> 09:43.335
I would have thought
finding Sean's body,

09:43.581 --> 09:45.883
being able to put him to rest,

09:46.178 --> 09:49.113
that I could start to find some peace.

09:49.119 --> 09:50.919
Yeah. These things take time.

09:50.925 --> 09:52.292
There's no way around it.

09:53.578 --> 09:56.547
My brain is on a never-ending loop.

09:56.553 --> 10:00.523
I cannot stop picturing the
moment he fell overboard.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.818
It just doesn't add up, Ted.

10:02.824 --> 10:06.303
How does a man work on
a boat his entire life

10:06.837 --> 10:08.838
and die like that?

10:10.341 --> 10:11.985
Freak accident.

10:12.917 --> 10:14.418
Things happen.

10:15.780 --> 10:17.281
Not to Sean.

10:29.607 --> 10:31.561
I saw Robb this morning.

10:31.567 --> 10:33.660
He had an idea about the MRC.

10:34.581 --> 10:36.482
He'd like to rent some space.

10:36.516 --> 10:39.493
Maybe the warehouse? It
could help cover our funding.

10:39.499 --> 10:42.134
You want to rent space to a stranger?

10:42.140 --> 10:43.489
He's not a stranger.

10:43.523 --> 10:45.124
He is to me.

10:45.158 --> 10:47.426
It's too risky having someone in there,

10:47.461 --> 10:50.229
close to all of the
stuff we're working on.

10:50.629 --> 10:51.963
Don't you see that?

10:55.335 --> 10:56.502
Nice catch.

10:56.536 --> 10:58.404
Look who just woke up.

11:02.021 --> 11:03.455
Hi, Mama.

11:03.461 --> 11:05.696
- This is food for her?
- Yeah.

11:09.483 --> 11:11.250
Oh, no, Ryn.

11:11.284 --> 11:12.852
We...

11:12.886 --> 11:15.554
On land, they just drink
straight from the bottle.

11:17.057 --> 11:18.457
Like this.

11:21.628 --> 11:23.529
Yeah, that's it.

11:23.563 --> 11:24.630
Nice.

11:25.081 --> 11:26.715
Good girl.

11:28.735 --> 11:30.436
Oh, good appetite.

11:32.059 --> 11:34.027
Maybe we could go to the library,

11:34.033 --> 11:35.834
get some children's books.

11:35.840 --> 11:37.808
A lot of mothers like
reading to their kids.

11:37.933 --> 11:39.678
Yes. Reading.

11:39.713 --> 11:41.380
I like this.

11:41.414 --> 11:44.316
Never too young to start.

11:44.351 --> 11:47.186
I'll see you all later. I
got to get back to the shop.

11:47.220 --> 11:48.754
Hi! Mwah, mwah!

11:50.323 --> 11:53.163
We will go when she's done eating.

11:55.162 --> 11:56.896
Yummy.

11:59.266 --> 12:00.599
Okay, okay...

12:07.574 --> 12:08.574
Oh, hey.

12:08.608 --> 12:10.042
Oh, hey.

12:10.076 --> 12:12.056
Wow. That's her.

12:12.257 --> 12:13.824
Yes.

12:14.614 --> 12:16.048
Wow.

12:17.250 --> 12:18.584
What's her name?

12:19.187 --> 12:21.188
Baby.

12:22.622 --> 12:26.091
Well, she's a miracle.

12:26.463 --> 12:28.931
Okay, I'm happy for you.

12:28.937 --> 12:30.905
Thank you, Xander.

12:30.911 --> 12:32.078
You helped me.

12:33.435 --> 12:35.402
Oh, sorry. I got to run.

12:35.437 --> 12:37.638
Big exam, but wish me luck.

12:37.672 --> 12:38.772
Good luck!

12:41.701 --> 12:43.669
You don't have to call
her Baby, you know.

12:43.703 --> 12:45.604
You can pick any name you want.

12:46.940 --> 12:48.474
No.

12:48.508 --> 12:50.266
She's Baby.

12:50.810 --> 12:52.278
Okay, that works.

13:09.796 --> 13:11.530
Miss Brennan, the exam is over.

13:11.564 --> 13:13.361
Doing my best, ma'am.

13:13.367 --> 13:14.667
Miss Brennan.

13:27.747 --> 13:32.718
I started this research to
help my mother, Elaine Pownall.

13:32.752 --> 13:35.187
She's been confined to a wheelchair.

13:35.221 --> 13:38.724
Paraplegic for the past decade
due to a boating accident.

13:38.758 --> 13:41.193
To date, she has received

13:41.227 --> 13:44.382
three doses of aquatic stem cells,

13:44.388 --> 13:46.732
has recovered minor sensation

13:46.766 --> 13:49.068
throughout her lower extremities.

13:49.578 --> 13:53.748
Her treatments were terminated
due to a shortage of cells.

13:55.775 --> 13:59.244
But I have located another source.

13:59.279 --> 14:04.249
And rather than expose
my mother to any risk,

14:04.284 --> 14:08.487
I have decided to conduct
an experiment on myself

14:08.521 --> 14:11.023
to better understand its viability.

14:11.057 --> 14:13.759
As of today, I have injected myself

14:13.793 --> 14:17.763
with three doses of aquatic stem cells.

14:17.797 --> 14:20.766
The same as my mother.

14:20.800 --> 14:26.672
I've experienced rapid
and complete healing

14:26.706 --> 14:29.074
of a deep wound on my right hand...

14:32.812 --> 14:35.347
... leaving no visible signs of trauma.

14:35.382 --> 14:37.683
This morning, I had an episode

14:37.717 --> 14:38.784
of acute hearing...

14:42.288 --> 14:46.725
I've also had moments of
improved reflex response.

14:50.568 --> 14:53.603
I will continue to inject myself

14:53.609 --> 14:54.967
with the stem cells,

14:55.001 --> 14:56.868
and monitor my results.

14:57.837 --> 15:01.140
So far, the effects
have been significant.

15:02.742 --> 15:06.078
But what I hope to discover is...

15:07.280 --> 15:08.814
What are the limits?

15:40.361 --> 15:41.828
Waiting to gloat?

15:42.033 --> 15:44.835
No. I just wanted to
see if you were okay.

15:44.841 --> 15:46.101
What are you up to?

15:46.107 --> 15:47.567
Okay.

15:47.602 --> 15:49.636
Someone must have seriously
hurt you in your life,

15:49.671 --> 15:51.772
because, I mean, you
don't trust for shit.

15:51.806 --> 15:53.473
I know I failed.

15:53.508 --> 15:54.841
I can't screw up again.

15:54.876 --> 15:56.443
Okay, so you won't.

15:56.477 --> 15:58.445
Hey, let me buy you a drink, okay?

15:58.479 --> 15:59.846
Tonight, at the Anchor.

15:59.881 --> 16:02.948
Maybe all you need to
do is just chill out.

16:03.851 --> 16:06.353
That's your solution?
Get drunk at the Anchor?

16:06.387 --> 16:08.088
Yeah.

16:08.122 --> 16:10.357
Thanks, but no thanks.

16:10.391 --> 16:12.159
Not really in a social mood.

16:17.300 --> 16:20.302
I'm trying to find this book

16:20.308 --> 16:22.536
about an elephant who loved letters.

16:22.570 --> 16:25.172
Welcome.

16:25.206 --> 16:26.773
Come on in.

16:26.808 --> 16:28.875
Nice to see you.

16:28.910 --> 16:30.944
Welcome to Mommy & Me.

16:34.119 --> 16:36.086
Oh, won't you join us?

16:37.300 --> 16:39.601
- Okay, yes.
- Okay.

16:41.990 --> 16:44.591
Maybe it was a lion who loved letters.

16:46.139 --> 16:48.295
One, two, three...

16:48.329 --> 16:50.030
Oh, God.

16:51.445 --> 16:52.679
Okay.

16:53.434 --> 16:55.335
This is a group.

16:55.370 --> 16:57.170
I've been invited.

16:57.205 --> 16:58.505
Okay.

16:58.539 --> 17:00.440
It takes a village to raise a child,

17:00.446 --> 17:03.414
so all are welcome to
stay and participate.

17:03.420 --> 17:04.887
Thank you.

17:08.717 --> 17:12.239
Well, looks like we have
a few new moms today.

17:12.244 --> 17:15.821
So please introduce
yourself, your little one,

17:15.857 --> 17:17.955
and tell us how old your baby is.

17:18.907 --> 17:21.709
Hi, I'm Kate. This is my baby, Beckett.

17:21.714 --> 17:25.416
And Beckett just turned
two months old yesterday.

17:25.423 --> 17:27.357
Aw.

17:27.670 --> 17:29.669
Hi, I am Ryn.

17:29.704 --> 17:32.072
And this is my baby, Baby.

17:32.613 --> 17:34.981
And how old is Baby?

17:36.411 --> 17:38.078
Two months old yesterday.

17:38.112 --> 17:40.930
How fun. They have the same birthday.

17:41.949 --> 17:43.850
I thought it would be nice

17:43.885 --> 17:45.271
to go around the circle

17:45.277 --> 17:47.660
and just say the first
thing that comes to mind

17:47.666 --> 17:50.501
when I ask you what you
want most for your baby.

17:50.658 --> 17:52.243
Let's go ahead and start with you.

17:52.249 --> 17:53.960
To be happy.

17:53.995 --> 17:55.629
Wonderful.

17:55.663 --> 17:57.998
I agree. Just to be happy.

17:59.179 --> 18:00.613
To find purpose.

18:01.436 --> 18:03.203
To be successful.

18:04.906 --> 18:06.273
To survive.

18:06.806 --> 18:09.641
Yeah, I mean, it's a
scary world out there.

18:10.311 --> 18:11.778
To swim.

18:11.813 --> 18:13.980
Water safety. So important.

18:14.015 --> 18:15.649
To hunt for herself.

18:18.986 --> 18:20.587
She lives on a farm.

18:20.621 --> 18:21.988
That's...

18:32.745 --> 18:34.212
Marissa.

18:34.535 --> 18:36.704
Mr. Pownall, what can I do for you?

18:36.710 --> 18:37.943
I need Dale.

18:37.949 --> 18:40.618
Sheriff's still out on that case.

18:41.042 --> 18:42.776
If I can help you...

18:45.805 --> 18:48.540
This is something I need to
discuss with Dale in private.

18:48.816 --> 18:50.317
Tell him to call me.

18:51.452 --> 18:52.853
Yes, sir.

18:56.057 --> 18:59.981
I appreciate you getting
out, helping me train.

18:59.987 --> 19:02.336
Well, it's good for me too.

19:02.342 --> 19:04.543
Clear the mind.

19:05.833 --> 19:08.468
Hey, I saw Ryn's baby...

19:08.807 --> 19:10.541
earlier, at the library.

19:11.739 --> 19:13.306
It's weird, man.

19:13.341 --> 19:15.075
Feels like she's mine.

19:17.512 --> 19:19.045
I'm going to help raise her.

19:19.080 --> 19:21.982
That seems normal to me.

19:22.016 --> 19:23.350
Dude!

19:23.384 --> 19:24.651
Dude!

19:25.887 --> 19:27.154
Sorry, man. I...

19:28.523 --> 19:29.823
I thought I was in better shape.

19:31.722 --> 19:34.458
You been... You been training, huh?

19:34.965 --> 19:36.732
Yeah.

19:37.064 --> 19:39.008
Something like that.

19:39.700 --> 19:42.536
Your granddaughter's going to love it.

19:42.570 --> 19:44.037
I'm sure she will.

19:44.071 --> 19:45.639
Thank you.

19:51.112 --> 19:52.779
Hello, Helen.

19:54.682 --> 19:56.116
What's brought you to land?

19:58.119 --> 19:59.686
My sale?

20:04.125 --> 20:06.993
All these toys are designed

20:07.028 --> 20:10.730
to stimulate visual and auditory senses.

20:11.866 --> 20:13.767
Here, like this.

20:13.801 --> 20:16.102
This just, like, makes a sound.

20:16.137 --> 20:18.004
Just... yeah.

20:28.975 --> 20:30.509
What is this song?

20:31.452 --> 20:33.920
Oh, a lullaby.

20:33.955 --> 20:37.624
Sometimes moms sing this
to comfort their babies,

20:37.658 --> 20:38.925
get them to sleep.

20:40.161 --> 20:41.595
I like this song.

20:41.629 --> 20:43.976
Nowadays, there are
so many different ways

20:43.982 --> 20:45.283
to raise a child,

20:45.289 --> 20:48.401
and just as many styles of parenting.

20:48.436 --> 20:51.705
One such style is called
attachment parenting.

20:51.739 --> 20:55.257
It promotes continuous
bodily closeness and touch.

20:55.263 --> 20:57.864
You're never supposed to
put your baby down, right?

20:57.870 --> 20:59.203
Yes, that's the ideal.

20:59.209 --> 21:00.809
If you never put the baby down,

21:00.815 --> 21:02.983
then how does the baby learn to fight?

21:03.017 --> 21:04.484
Well...

21:05.753 --> 21:07.153
That's an interesting question.

21:10.524 --> 21:12.537
What is it doing?

21:12.543 --> 21:14.648
I suppose your baby never cries?

21:14.654 --> 21:15.895
No.

21:15.930 --> 21:18.164
If my baby cried, it would be eaten.

21:20.101 --> 21:21.167
What?

21:23.304 --> 21:25.772
All these babies would be eaten.

21:27.489 --> 21:29.276
Okay, Ryn, I think we should go.

21:30.978 --> 21:32.482
Thank you. We have to...

21:32.488 --> 21:34.180
Yeah, we have to head out.

21:34.215 --> 21:35.348
So, thank you so much.

21:35.383 --> 21:37.284
Thank you.

21:51.678 --> 21:53.522
_

21:53.528 --> 21:55.826
_

22:14.021 --> 22:16.022
Hey.

22:18.282 --> 22:20.226
Looks like you have some visitors.

22:20.261 --> 22:22.562
We have come to take baby.

22:22.596 --> 22:24.060
What? Take her?

22:24.066 --> 22:25.660
It is time.

22:25.666 --> 22:27.600
No. Never.

22:38.621 --> 22:40.121
Ben.

22:42.258 --> 22:43.324
Friend.

22:43.359 --> 22:44.959
It's good to see you, Levi.

22:44.994 --> 22:47.095
Ben.

22:47.129 --> 22:48.329
Friend.

22:49.498 --> 22:51.099
Yeah.

22:51.133 --> 22:53.368
- Where's Ryn?
- Talking.

22:54.470 --> 22:55.970
I'm going to check on them.

23:00.009 --> 23:01.342
What's going on?

23:01.377 --> 23:03.611
Levi and Mate came to get the baby,

23:03.646 --> 23:05.346
take it to the water.

23:06.669 --> 23:08.036
Why?

23:08.042 --> 23:10.351
The men always take the babies.

23:10.386 --> 23:12.250
They teach them to fight,

23:12.256 --> 23:14.194
to survive in the water.

23:14.223 --> 23:15.657
That is their job.

23:18.027 --> 23:19.294
Hey.

23:20.396 --> 23:21.696
What do you want?

23:21.730 --> 23:25.300
I know this is how is it done.

23:25.334 --> 23:27.202
My mother, she gave me away.

23:28.460 --> 23:31.161
I did not see her again
until I was older.

23:31.509 --> 23:32.809
But...

23:33.742 --> 23:36.377
There is something...

23:36.981 --> 23:38.715
In here.

23:39.215 --> 23:40.782
A feeling

23:40.816 --> 23:43.418
that tells me not to give her away.

23:44.587 --> 23:46.888
Your maternal instinct.

23:46.922 --> 23:49.757
Your human maternal instinct.

23:53.095 --> 23:55.706
Maybe I can raise Baby on land.

23:56.027 --> 23:58.900
Maybe I can do it differently.

23:58.934 --> 24:01.402
If she doesn't go back to the water,

24:02.023 --> 24:04.758
she may never adapt.

24:05.222 --> 24:07.790
She may never be one of your kind.

24:08.043 --> 24:09.578
Ryn,

24:09.584 --> 24:12.580
this child is your people's hope.

24:14.183 --> 24:16.251
Does it have to be the males?

24:16.285 --> 24:19.520
Maybe you could be the one to
take her in the water instead.

24:20.723 --> 24:21.956
No.

24:24.360 --> 24:27.428
They give her things I cannot.

24:27.463 --> 24:30.598
We've seen it in other aquatic species.

24:30.633 --> 24:34.202
The males trigger a different
hormonal response in the young.

24:35.174 --> 24:38.042
It can affect their growth, development.

24:42.911 --> 24:44.178
She's crying.

24:44.213 --> 24:46.114
She's not supposed to cry.

24:46.148 --> 24:48.750
She's been on land too long.

24:54.923 --> 24:57.325
Ben, we must go.

25:03.332 --> 25:05.400
I need you to promise me

25:05.567 --> 25:08.469
that you will protect
the baby in the water.

25:08.504 --> 25:10.271
Promise?

25:10.306 --> 25:14.409
A promise is when you say
that you will do something

25:14.443 --> 25:17.245
and you do it, no matter what.

25:17.279 --> 25:19.347
Then, yes, I promise.

25:21.450 --> 25:22.817
With my life.

25:28.991 --> 25:30.758
We'll wait until dark.

25:30.793 --> 25:32.427
It'll be safer then.

25:46.568 --> 25:48.513
_

25:49.044 --> 25:51.079
I'm sorry, wait.

25:51.113 --> 25:52.847
So you get a shot
because I passed my exam?

25:52.881 --> 25:54.315
Is that how this is working?

25:54.350 --> 25:56.517
Yeah. Celebration by association.

25:58.120 --> 26:00.521
- Okay, all right. Fair enough.
- Let's go.

26:00.556 --> 26:02.033
Congratulations, Xander.

26:02.039 --> 26:03.985
Having never passed an
exam in high school,

26:03.991 --> 26:06.127
- the odds were with you.
- Ah-ha.

26:06.161 --> 26:08.363
Funny. You got jokes. You're hilarious.

26:08.397 --> 26:10.498
Annie, hey! Come on.
Come on over, come on.

26:10.532 --> 26:12.600
- She seems familiar.
- Yeah, she's my partner.

26:12.634 --> 26:14.535
Remember, the one that helped me

26:14.570 --> 26:16.281
save both your asses the other night?

26:16.287 --> 26:18.206
- No?
- Oh. Yeah, right.

26:18.240 --> 26:20.041
Look, I'm glad you changed your mind.

26:20.075 --> 26:22.043
- Janine, could we get three more shots?
- Coming up.

26:22.077 --> 26:24.312
How's your Girls Gone
Wild cruise line going?

26:24.346 --> 26:25.546
Hm.

26:25.581 --> 26:28.149
That was merely a bump in the road.

26:28.183 --> 26:31.880
We run a very reputable mermaid
sighting excursion line.

26:31.886 --> 26:34.855
I wouldn't call one boat a "line."

26:34.861 --> 26:37.225
- Shall we?
- Oh, I should probably not drink that.

26:37.259 --> 26:39.894
Okay, well, last I checked,

26:39.928 --> 26:41.562
today was Friday.

26:41.597 --> 26:43.398
Which means we've got two days

26:43.432 --> 26:45.566
to be whatever kind of idiots we want.

26:45.601 --> 26:48.057
Yeah, come on. I got your back.

26:48.063 --> 26:50.064
Okay, fine, McClure.

26:50.669 --> 26:52.102
You make a solid argument.

26:52.108 --> 26:54.609
When it comes to
drinking, he always does.

27:27.414 --> 27:29.845
_

27:41.056 --> 27:45.660
_

27:57.439 --> 27:58.773
Ready, Ryn?

28:01.577 --> 28:04.566
It's dark. It'll be
safer for them to go now.

28:05.212 --> 28:06.412
Yes.

28:06.418 --> 28:07.882
It's the right decision.

28:07.916 --> 28:09.550
She needs to be back in the water.

28:09.928 --> 28:11.576
It's where she belongs.

28:12.488 --> 28:13.688
For now.

28:46.701 --> 28:49.810
_

28:49.832 --> 28:52.685
_

28:56.886 --> 28:58.285
_

28:58.291 --> 29:00.336
_

29:00.342 --> 29:03.483
_

29:04.563 --> 29:07.040
_

29:07.046 --> 29:08.619
_

29:10.321 --> 29:12.641
_

29:12.647 --> 29:15.637
_

29:25.984 --> 29:28.945
_

29:50.885 --> 29:53.713
She must learn to survive in the water.

29:56.830 --> 29:58.397
It's the only way.

29:58.432 --> 30:00.132
You're doing the right thing.

30:01.462 --> 30:04.403
Helen said she is hope for my people.

30:07.441 --> 30:09.875
This will be her new name.

30:09.910 --> 30:11.611
"Hope."

30:11.645 --> 30:13.245
Ryn, that's beautiful.

30:19.332 --> 30:23.302
When we meet again, you will be grown.

30:23.883 --> 30:27.085
You will not remember this time with me.

30:29.296 --> 30:32.865
So I will remember for us both.

30:41.141 --> 30:44.877
Go learn and be strong.

31:01.324 --> 31:02.624
I will protect.

31:03.530 --> 31:04.797
I promise.

31:21.714 --> 31:24.216
I was wrong about you.

31:24.251 --> 31:26.118
You're one of the good ones.

31:26.153 --> 31:29.689
Yeah, well, I was wrong about you too.

31:29.723 --> 31:31.214
I mean, you know, you're still a pain

31:31.220 --> 31:32.630
in the ass and everything, but...

31:32.659 --> 31:34.152
I take that as a compliment.

31:34.158 --> 31:36.162
We definitely got to, you know,

31:36.196 --> 31:38.776
work on the whole
liquor tolerance thing.

31:38.782 --> 31:39.899
But you're cool.

31:44.404 --> 31:46.005
It's my ex-girlfriend.

31:46.039 --> 31:47.707
What?

31:47.741 --> 31:50.734
The one who hurt me so bad
I don't trust for shit.

31:50.936 --> 31:52.269
Oh, no.

31:52.275 --> 31:53.642
Wow.

31:53.947 --> 31:55.915
What happened?

31:55.949 --> 31:59.051
It's so boring and cliché
it'll put you to sleep.

31:59.086 --> 32:00.701
Oh. She cheated.

32:02.114 --> 32:03.656
The first time was okay.

32:03.690 --> 32:06.058
The second time was bearable.

32:06.093 --> 32:08.027
And it was after that
I started wondering

32:08.061 --> 32:09.962
what was wrong with me.

32:11.557 --> 32:14.459
Well, you know, for what it's worth,

32:14.465 --> 32:15.832
what she did,

32:15.838 --> 32:20.675
seems more about her
than it does about you.

32:20.907 --> 32:24.410
What the hell? Look.

32:24.444 --> 32:26.245
Those guys, they're going in the water.

32:26.279 --> 32:27.747
- They got a baby.
- No, wait...

32:27.781 --> 32:30.449
Hey, stop! Wait!

32:30.484 --> 32:34.353
Yes, hello? There's two men in
the ocean, and they've got a baby.

32:34.387 --> 32:36.277
- They just went under!
- Who are you calling?

32:36.283 --> 32:37.623
911.

32:37.657 --> 32:39.959
What? Yes, Thompson Beach.

32:39.993 --> 32:41.127
We'll be here.

32:44.998 --> 32:46.966
How long will they keep Hope for?

32:47.000 --> 32:48.968
Until she is grown.

32:49.002 --> 32:50.436
Able to hunt.

32:50.470 --> 32:51.971
Given the pregnancy,

32:52.005 --> 32:54.206
they grow a lot faster than we do.

32:54.241 --> 32:56.008
Might not be as long as we think.

32:59.653 --> 33:01.387
Oh...

33:01.782 --> 33:04.011
- You are okay?
- _

33:04.017 --> 33:06.786
I forgot I had this dinner plan.

33:06.820 --> 33:07.987
I just need to cancel it.

33:08.021 --> 33:09.655
- It's...
- Robb?

33:09.689 --> 33:11.724
Yeah.

33:11.758 --> 33:13.025
You should go.

33:14.027 --> 33:15.194
It is good.

33:17.497 --> 33:18.964
You are love.

33:19.663 --> 33:21.100
Ben is love.

33:22.269 --> 33:23.896
That doesn't change,

33:23.902 --> 33:26.437
even if you two are not together.

33:31.978 --> 33:33.512
I'm always here for you.

33:43.623 --> 33:46.392
Look, Hope won't be gone forever.

33:49.162 --> 33:50.963
You miss her too?

34:03.643 --> 34:06.045
You're positive that's what you saw?

34:06.079 --> 34:07.313
Yes.

34:07.347 --> 34:09.215
Two men, and they had a baby.

34:09.248 --> 34:11.984
They just disappeared under the waves.

34:12.018 --> 34:13.351
And you saw that too?

34:14.855 --> 34:16.288
I didn't see anything.

34:16.322 --> 34:18.826
What? You were standing
right next to me.

34:18.831 --> 34:22.232
Miss Brennan, it'd be real
wise of you to let him finish.

34:22.237 --> 34:25.130
I mean, you know, we've
been drinking some, so...

34:25.165 --> 34:28.400
Making a false 911 call
is a serious violation

34:28.435 --> 34:30.135
of state penal code.

34:30.170 --> 34:31.904
It wasn't false.

34:31.938 --> 34:34.406
A deputy in training ought to know that.

34:35.442 --> 34:36.876
Both of you.

34:36.909 --> 34:39.322
Come on, guys, let's go!

34:50.177 --> 34:52.379
What the hell was that about?
Why'd you do that?

34:52.397 --> 34:53.864
I didn't tell you to call 911.

34:53.898 --> 34:56.800
Well, I see two men walking
a baby into the water,

34:56.833 --> 34:58.135
I'm calling it in.

34:58.169 --> 34:59.703
Unless that isn't what you saw.

34:59.737 --> 35:01.905
You know, maybe it
could've been the shadows.

35:01.940 --> 35:03.473
What? Are you crazy?

35:03.508 --> 35:05.642
Maybe you just had more
to drink than you thought.

35:05.677 --> 35:07.406
That's how you want to play it?

35:07.412 --> 35:09.413
I didn't see what you saw.

35:09.512 --> 35:13.143
You said you had my back.
This is how you show it?

35:13.573 --> 35:15.307
She could report me.

35:15.313 --> 35:17.381
Come on, she's not going
to report you, okay?

35:17.387 --> 35:19.354
She's going to forget
about it in, like, an hour.

35:19.360 --> 35:21.561
Oh, no, she won't. Even
if she doesn't report me,

35:21.595 --> 35:24.364
she's going to remember it
every time she sees my face.

35:26.700 --> 35:28.601
Thanks for having my back.

35:28.636 --> 35:30.103
Partner.

35:30.137 --> 35:31.537
Ann...

35:36.377 --> 35:39.345
I'm so sorry I messed
up our fancy dinner.

35:39.380 --> 35:40.974
Are you kidding me?

35:40.980 --> 35:43.082
I have been to thousands
of fancy dinners,

35:43.117 --> 35:46.386
and trust me, none compare to this.

35:49.950 --> 35:51.083
Mm.

35:51.118 --> 35:52.801
- Oh, my God.
- Wow.

35:52.807 --> 35:54.040
Mm-hmm.

35:54.046 --> 35:55.880
Why does this combo taste so good?

35:55.914 --> 35:59.584
I guess some things just
work better together.

36:02.921 --> 36:04.555
Cheers.

36:04.590 --> 36:06.758
- How was Portland?
- Great.

36:06.792 --> 36:08.726
We raised some more money.

36:08.732 --> 36:11.783
This movement, it's
really gaining momentum.

36:11.789 --> 36:13.369
People want change.

36:13.375 --> 36:15.843
Can't keep treating the planet
like it's an endless resource.

36:15.849 --> 36:18.903
- Totally agree.
- This project's moving forward.

36:18.937 --> 36:21.139
Beta testing here is the next step.

36:21.173 --> 36:22.807
Get this technology working.

36:23.485 --> 36:25.633
Oh, and did you speak to Ben

36:25.639 --> 36:28.146
about renting space at the MRC?

36:29.711 --> 36:31.538
He didn't go for it.

36:32.036 --> 36:33.270
Sorry.

36:33.304 --> 36:34.838
That's cool.

36:34.873 --> 36:36.673
We'll find another place to rent.

36:38.643 --> 36:39.877
Mm.

36:41.846 --> 36:42.946
You know what?

36:42.981 --> 36:44.248
Forget it.

36:44.282 --> 36:45.849
- What?
- Come on.

36:45.884 --> 36:48.352
- Where are we going?
- Come on.

36:49.269 --> 36:50.836
You'll see.

36:53.461 --> 36:54.694
Okay.

37:04.903 --> 37:06.870
You're back.

37:06.905 --> 37:09.699
- Use your words.
- She sent me.

37:09.705 --> 37:11.706
- Who?
- Tia.

37:11.740 --> 37:13.392
Katrina chooses Tia.

37:13.398 --> 37:14.865
Katrina is with them now?

37:14.871 --> 37:17.506
They were her family when she was born.

37:17.512 --> 37:19.914
- What about the others?
- Some got away.

37:19.948 --> 37:23.525
Others try to fight and are killed.

37:23.531 --> 37:25.686
- What, and you got out?
- No.

37:25.721 --> 37:27.521
She let me go.

37:27.556 --> 37:28.890
To tell you.

37:28.924 --> 37:30.324
Tell me what?

37:30.359 --> 37:32.059
Come with her...

37:32.094 --> 37:33.427
Or die.

37:38.867 --> 37:40.635
Ta-da!

37:41.829 --> 37:43.571
Wow.

37:45.321 --> 37:47.642
- This could work.
- Yeah.

37:49.357 --> 37:51.379
Is there a weird smell in here?

37:51.413 --> 37:52.613
Like a little musty?

37:52.648 --> 37:53.848
No.

37:55.117 --> 37:56.456
Like something rotting.

37:56.462 --> 37:58.129
No, I don't smell it.

37:58.135 --> 37:59.620
- Really?
- No.

38:00.923 --> 38:03.055
I think it's coming from here.

38:03.061 --> 38:07.164
We used to store food for
the sea lions in the freezer.

38:11.419 --> 38:13.153
Yeah, trust me,

38:13.159 --> 38:15.761
the sea lions definitely don't
want whatever's in there.

38:16.071 --> 38:17.471
Okay.

38:27.966 --> 38:29.200
What is that?

38:37.557 --> 38:40.594
I must make the water safe for Hope.

38:42.130 --> 38:43.698
I want to help you.

38:46.223 --> 38:48.558
This is a fight beneath the water.

38:49.893 --> 38:51.561
There's nothing you can do.

39:19.293 --> 39:22.528
- Ted.
- So, how was the sale?

39:22.534 --> 39:24.268
A windfall.

39:25.711 --> 39:27.964
I ran into Patty yesterday.

39:27.998 --> 39:29.899
Asked her how she was holding up.

39:29.933 --> 39:31.234
Know what she said?

39:31.268 --> 39:33.328
Of course I do.

39:33.334 --> 39:34.634
She's my friend.

39:35.998 --> 39:38.407
They killed her husband, those things.

39:39.610 --> 39:40.743
Didn't they?

39:42.043 --> 39:44.914
We've managed to keep
everything under control

39:44.948 --> 39:48.651
for the past 150 years.

39:48.685 --> 39:52.076
Three deaths in town, shots fired.

39:52.482 --> 39:54.498
Two murders.

39:55.392 --> 39:58.728
Does not feel like things
are under control, Helen.

39:58.762 --> 40:01.063
What do you want, Ted?

40:01.658 --> 40:03.192
I want information.

40:03.198 --> 40:05.419
I want to know where they are.

40:05.796 --> 40:07.230
How many there are.

40:08.038 --> 40:10.606
And what are you going to
do with this information?

40:10.641 --> 40:12.642
I don't know yet.

40:14.077 --> 40:15.611
Then I say no.

40:15.646 --> 40:19.749
There's no point in your having it.
