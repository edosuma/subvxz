00:10.596 --> 00:11.896
Turn off the computer.

00:11.932 --> 00:13.706
- He's dating her.
- You don't need him.

00:13.706 --> 00:14.756
- Say it.
- I don't need him.

00:14.792 --> 00:16.840
- You're better off without him.
- I'm better without him.

00:16.875 --> 00:18.407
- You fall hard and...
- And too fast.

00:18.442 --> 00:20.576
And what I need is to be myself.

00:20.611 --> 00:22.377
On my own.

00:22.413 --> 00:24.413
By stepping away from the computer.

00:26.283 --> 00:27.683
Well, are you stepping?

00:28.886 --> 00:30.198
- I hate you.
- Good girl.

00:30.223 --> 00:31.363
Now hang up so I can go back to sleep.

00:45.778 --> 00:47.744
You ever tried going down a fire pole?

00:47.780 --> 00:49.880
It's not easy.

00:49.915 --> 00:51.281
There's no perfect way to get down.

00:52.355 --> 00:54.249
But there's definitely a wrong way.

00:55.252 --> 00:57.352
Hold on too tight, and you won't slide...

00:57.388 --> 00:59.121
you'll just hang there, dangling.

00:59.156 --> 01:00.690
Stuck.

01:00.725 --> 01:02.224
Nobody wants to get stuck.

01:02.259 --> 01:04.961
That's why I decided a long time ago

01:04.995 --> 01:06.562
just to use the damn stairs.

01:13.144 --> 01:15.166
I know you all know this,
but I'm still gonna say it...

01:15.166 --> 01:16.165
contain the flame and get the hell out!

01:16.200 --> 01:18.668
Laminar smoke flow,
small chance of flashover.

01:18.703 --> 01:19.935
My guess is the back of the house.

01:19.970 --> 01:21.136
Hey, Gibson, you in a hurry?

01:21.172 --> 01:22.769
I haven't even given the plan yet.

01:22.797 --> 01:24.162
Just ready to get in there, sir.

01:24.198 --> 01:26.366
- Miller, partner with Gibson.
- You got it.

01:26.402 --> 01:28.666
Andy, you and Bishop
handle search and rescue.

01:28.702 --> 01:31.669
And let's get somebody
up on that roof to vent!

01:33.072 --> 01:35.172
Entryway's clear. Left wall... check.

01:35.208 --> 01:36.449
Right wall... check.

01:45.250 --> 01:46.921
Living room... clear.

01:46.957 --> 01:48.451
Kitchen and dining room... clear!

01:51.490 --> 01:52.656
We got somebody!

01:52.691 --> 01:54.958
We got a conscious victim inside...
gonna need medics standing by out front.

01:54.994 --> 01:55.993
Thank God.

01:56.028 --> 01:56.960
Ma'am, can you walk?

01:56.996 --> 01:58.489
- We need to get you out of here.
- Hang on.

01:58.524 --> 02:00.399
- Did she really just say, "Hang on"?
- Okay, no.

02:00.434 --> 02:01.998
No, no, no, no, no.

02:06.237 --> 02:08.169
Charge the line!

02:08.205 --> 02:09.348
Okay, you got it!

02:11.075 --> 02:13.475
The wet stuff on the red stuff!

02:25.121 --> 02:27.355
Check her vitals. Watch her ABCs.

02:30.427 --> 02:32.694
- BP's 80/60.
- Can you tell me your name?

02:32.729 --> 02:33.743
Tiffany.

02:33.778 --> 02:35.062
Tiffany, this is very important.

02:35.097 --> 02:37.164
Was there anyone else inside with you?

02:38.596 --> 02:40.827
Charlie.

02:43.238 --> 02:44.665
Hold on the pipe!

02:45.407 --> 02:47.041
Fire's out.

02:47.076 --> 02:48.408
Another possible victim inside, guys.

02:48.444 --> 02:50.873
Name's Charlie. Repeat... Charlie.

02:50.908 --> 02:52.511
Damn. If he's in there,
he's already toast.

02:52.547 --> 02:53.596
- Shut up.
- What?

02:53.632 --> 02:54.847
The whole place is charcoal.

02:54.883 --> 02:56.749
Dean. Enough.

02:56.785 --> 02:58.384
You think anybody would
survive this kind of burnout?

02:58.419 --> 02:59.719
Shut up!

02:59.754 --> 03:01.054
You guys hear that?

03:02.123 --> 03:04.290
Oh, my God. It's a kid.

03:04.325 --> 03:05.511
- Charlie!
- Charlie?

03:05.546 --> 03:07.259
- Charlie!
- Charlie!

03:07.295 --> 03:08.310
- Charlie!
- Charlie!

03:08.345 --> 03:09.290
- Charlie!
- Charlie!

03:09.325 --> 03:10.095
- Charlie!
- Charlie!

03:10.130 --> 03:12.030
Wait, guys, guys, stop.

03:14.001 --> 03:15.033
There.

03:26.579 --> 03:28.245
Dibs on the puppy.

03:29.315 --> 03:31.415
You can't call dibs on the puppy.

03:31.450 --> 03:32.641
I just did.

03:32.676 --> 03:34.752
Dibs on that puppy.

03:51.036 --> 03:52.135
Charlie!

03:52.170 --> 03:53.236
Oh, my gosh!

03:53.271 --> 03:54.671
Oh, thank you, thank you!

03:54.706 --> 03:56.239
Yeah, of course.

03:56.274 --> 03:57.741
- Oh!
- I'm here to serve.

03:57.776 --> 03:59.141
Do you think he practices?

03:59.176 --> 04:01.409
Like, does he go to dog parks
on his days off?

04:01.445 --> 04:02.945
Yeah, cradle puppies under one arm,

04:02.980 --> 04:04.913
- wipe away pretend soot with the other.
- He must.

04:04.949 --> 04:06.314
I mean, look at him.

04:07.561 --> 04:09.417
You notice we're the ones
who saved her life,

04:09.453 --> 04:10.825
but he's the one she's thanking?

04:10.860 --> 04:12.975
That stuff's not gonna fly
when we're running this place.

04:13.010 --> 04:15.323
Next time, we save the puppy.

New Guy!

04:30.874 --> 04:31.906
Yo.

04:33.341 --> 04:35.508
Gonna need you to decon
the rest of these hand lines.

04:35.544 --> 04:37.144
Yeah, um.

04:37.179 --> 04:38.519
You... You know I'm not exactly new.

04:38.554 --> 04:41.048
I've been working here full time
for a couple weeks now.

04:41.083 --> 04:42.760
I chose to stop being a surgeon.

04:42.795 --> 04:44.551
I mean, I've... I've held
actual beating hearts

04:44.586 --> 04:46.319
in my hands.

04:46.354 --> 04:49.355
Look, all I'm saying is that
I'm not some clueless kid

04:49.391 --> 04:51.323
who doesn't understand
hard work and discipline.

04:51.358 --> 04:53.225
I can do more than just clean hoses.

04:53.260 --> 04:54.326
Yeah.

04:54.361 --> 04:56.016
Sure thing, New Guy. Follow me.

04:57.231 --> 04:58.698
Also, I have a name.

05:00.367 --> 05:01.500
Do these, as well.

05:01.535 --> 05:02.766
Clean 'em. Hang 'em.

05:02.801 --> 05:04.070
Oh, and one of them has a hole,

05:04.105 --> 05:05.504
so you'll need to patch that up.

05:05.539 --> 05:07.405
Um, which one has the hole?

05:09.209 --> 05:11.242
You're not new?

05:11.277 --> 05:12.476
Figure it out.

05:15.515 --> 05:17.348
Fast containment today, sir.

05:17.383 --> 05:18.599
No casualties.

05:18.635 --> 05:20.719
Think that means today
might be a Pole Day?

05:20.754 --> 05:23.021
- You saved a puppy.
- And a Tiffany.

05:23.056 --> 05:26.690
Puppies and Tiffanys
do not equal pole days.

05:26.726 --> 05:28.892
Then what does? 'Cause in the
two years I've been here,

05:28.928 --> 05:29.893
not once have...

05:29.929 --> 05:32.162
Gibson, I enjoy your joy. I do.

05:32.198 --> 05:34.564
But I will know the perfect Pole Day
when I see the perfect Pole Day.

05:34.600 --> 05:37.334
Trust me... today's not it.

05:38.971 --> 05:41.570
It's so tall and shiny.

05:41.606 --> 05:45.174
Just staring down at us and mocking.

05:45.210 --> 05:46.743
I can feel it mocking.

05:46.778 --> 05:48.510
What's the point of having a fire pole

05:48.546 --> 05:50.179
if nobody ever gets to use it?

05:52.450 --> 05:54.283
It's like they think
the only thing on my mind

05:54.318 --> 05:55.451
is the damn pole.

05:55.486 --> 05:56.886
Yep. Sign this.

05:56.921 --> 05:58.253
And how many times do I have to say it?

05:58.288 --> 05:59.779
Don't "cross country" when we vent...

05:59.814 --> 06:01.422
Stick to a beam or stay off the roof.

06:01.458 --> 06:02.630
It's how people get hurt.

06:02.666 --> 06:04.459
- Drink.
- We have got to remember

06:04.494 --> 06:06.616
to watch the perimeter more Clo...

06:09.099 --> 06:10.298
This isn't water.

06:10.333 --> 06:11.532
It's a protein kale smoothie.

06:11.568 --> 06:12.700
You've been skipping meals.

06:12.736 --> 06:14.236
Keeping tabs on my food intake now?

06:14.271 --> 06:16.270
Someone needs to. I also
filed your incident reports,

06:16.305 --> 06:18.038
put the calendar out for approval,

06:18.074 --> 06:19.774
arranged maintenance checks on each...

06:36.457 --> 06:38.524
- You're lucky you're my daughter.
- So are you.

06:41.029 --> 06:42.461
All I'm saying is,

06:42.497 --> 06:45.165
the whole point of a meat loaf
is the meat.

06:45.200 --> 06:47.400
I don't mind the veggie kind,
especially when Travis makes it.

06:47.435 --> 06:49.779
- Yeah, it's pretty good.
- Ah. Thank you.

06:49.815 --> 06:51.728
- It's my husband's recipe.
- What's the matter, Dean?

06:51.763 --> 06:54.006
Trying to bulk up to rescue
more itty-bitty puppies?

06:54.041 --> 06:55.573
You gonna tell me that you
trained for the Olympics

06:55.609 --> 06:57.509
eating spaghetti made from squash?

06:57.544 --> 07:00.179
Consuming a plant-based
meal even once a week

07:00.214 --> 07:01.479
has quantifiable health benefits.

07:01.515 --> 07:03.315
That's true, actually.

07:03.350 --> 07:04.449
I've witnessed it firsthand,
in, you know, in the OR.

07:04.484 --> 07:05.684
Oh, of course you did.

07:05.719 --> 07:06.951
Yeah, I saw everything...

07:06.986 --> 07:08.445
the clogged arteries, the fatty tissue.

07:08.480 --> 07:09.790
You... You know,
I used to open people up...

07:09.826 --> 07:11.406
Okay. Okay, we got that.

07:11.441 --> 07:14.258
It takes guts to cut somebody open.

07:14.294 --> 07:16.427
I like guts.

07:16.462 --> 07:18.376
I expect everyone on my team
to have guts.

07:18.411 --> 07:21.532
Okay. Um, but how...
how do you mean, exactly?

07:21.567 --> 07:22.571
- Oh, God.
- Now you did it.

07:22.607 --> 07:24.534
- Here we go.
- There he goes.

07:24.569 --> 07:27.770
9/11, when I went to go help
with the Towers...

07:27.806 --> 07:29.472
Mm-hmm.

07:29.507 --> 07:31.641
...it was the worst thing
I ever saw in my life...

07:31.676 --> 07:32.843
It still is...

07:32.878 --> 07:34.811
and it got to me, all of it.

07:34.847 --> 07:37.113
And Andrea... she came out there.

07:37.149 --> 07:39.449
She hopped on a plane by herself,

07:39.484 --> 07:40.449
she came to New York,

07:40.484 --> 07:43.319
and she ordered me to come home.

07:45.422 --> 07:47.117
Saved my life.

07:48.667 --> 07:49.986
She was 12.

07:50.912 --> 07:53.690
And she hauled my ass back.

07:54.332 --> 07:55.825
My daughter's got guts.

07:55.861 --> 07:56.960
She's a force.

07:56.995 --> 07:59.316
She needs no one. She's Baby Rambo.

07:59.351 --> 08:00.996
And Baby Rambo says,

08:01.032 --> 08:02.831
let's talk about something else.

08:02.867 --> 08:05.554
I will talk about something else... Dean.

08:05.589 --> 08:06.642
- What the hell I do now?
- How about you

08:06.667 --> 08:07.703
stop throwing your dress blues

08:07.738 --> 08:08.871
in with my wash?

08:08.906 --> 08:10.005
Ah, please.

08:10.041 --> 08:12.175
I'm not your rookie anymore.
Do your own damn laundry.

08:12.210 --> 08:13.809
Hang on. That's not
really a thing, is it?

08:13.844 --> 08:16.010
- The rookies have to do the laundry?
- Actually, yes.

08:16.046 --> 08:17.579
Yes, it is.

08:21.218 --> 08:22.817
Ohh, I hate that story.

08:22.852 --> 08:24.819
I've always hated that story.

08:24.854 --> 08:26.221
Yeah. He thinks it's cute.

08:26.256 --> 08:27.855
It wasn't cute... it was messed up.

08:27.891 --> 08:29.123
- Forget about it.
- I can't.

08:29.159 --> 08:30.692
I... Mm.

08:36.232 --> 08:38.832
- Distracted yet?
- I'm Getting there.

08:39.368 --> 08:41.702
This is bold. Even for you.

08:41.736 --> 08:43.636
Say the word. I'll stop.

08:57.719 --> 08:58.884
Um...

08:58.920 --> 09:00.613
No, wait.

09:00.649 --> 09:01.821
I...

09:03.124 --> 09:05.890
Uh.

09:05.926 --> 09:07.759
No, we're not doing that right now.

09:07.794 --> 09:09.160
Hand it back.

09:09.196 --> 09:10.662
It's not...

09:10.698 --> 09:12.331
- You weren't supposed to see that yet.
- Okay.

09:12.366 --> 09:13.898
- Okay.
- Okay, yeah.

09:13.934 --> 09:15.531
I mean, I guess I thought...

09:16.704 --> 09:18.456
You... You don't seem happy about this.

09:18.492 --> 09:20.004
Yeah, no, it's not... I mean...

09:20.040 --> 09:22.073
Oh, God. I-I-I don't know...

09:22.109 --> 09:23.741
I... don't know what to say here.

09:23.776 --> 09:25.376
Do you just not want to get married?

09:25.411 --> 09:28.805
Or... do you not want
to get married to me?

09:29.982 --> 09:31.415
 Ladder, Engine,

09:31.451 --> 09:33.718
Aid Car 19, respond...

09:33.753 --> 09:35.085
apartment fire.

09:56.407 --> 09:57.831
What happened?

09:58.842 --> 10:00.667
Something bad?

10:01.412 --> 10:02.811
With Jack?

10:02.846 --> 10:04.112
How bad?

10:04.148 --> 10:05.414
What?

10:07.251 --> 10:08.651
He proposed!

10:08.686 --> 10:09.851
Andy, that's...

10:11.589 --> 10:13.488
Oh, we are not happy.

10:13.523 --> 10:15.657
Wait. How... Why... Why would we be?

10:15.692 --> 10:16.891
I mean, what was he thinking?

10:16.926 --> 10:18.293
He's a monster.

10:18.328 --> 10:20.094
You don't want to settle.
You're focused on work.

10:20.129 --> 10:22.062
You know, and the fun

10:22.098 --> 10:24.024
is in having secret sex, not...

10:24.059 --> 10:25.193
Hey, what're we talking about?

10:25.228 --> 10:26.668
- Nothing, New Guy.
- Nothing, New Guy.

10:34.009 --> 10:35.975
Hey, we've got a problem...
blocked hydrant.

10:36.011 --> 10:37.544
Oh, hell no.

10:38.295 --> 10:39.413
Everything is under control.

10:39.448 --> 10:40.646
Let's go. Thank you.

10:40.681 --> 10:42.015
Tanner speaking.

10:42.050 --> 10:43.917
Red zone applies to everyone.

10:46.855 --> 10:47.986
Crap.

10:48.022 --> 10:50.856
It goes... little old ladies,
cops, bomb squad, FBI...

10:50.891 --> 10:52.858
- Stop. Wait! I'm on my way!
- ...CIA, Homeland Security...

10:52.893 --> 10:55.027
...Fire Department,
anyone escaping the apocalypse,

10:55.062 --> 10:57.863
and then God. Are you God?
Because if not...

11:07.789 --> 11:09.207
- Really?
- Well, I needed the hydrant.

11:09.242 --> 11:10.809
- You weren't around.
- I was around,

11:10.844 --> 11:12.728
literally down the street,
evacuating people.

11:12.763 --> 11:13.878
But your car was blocking

11:13.913 --> 11:16.113
the water source we need
to fight the fire.

11:16.149 --> 11:17.615
I can't just ignore a call to help.

11:17.651 --> 11:19.951
I don't expect you to ignore it. I
expect you to watch where you're parking

11:19.986 --> 11:21.985
- when you answer it.
- You gave me no time.

11:22.020 --> 11:23.053
- I called.
- To gloat!

11:23.088 --> 11:24.054
- To tell you!
- Too late.

11:24.089 --> 11:26.223
- You can't just ram my car!
- You can't just block my hydrant!

11:26.258 --> 11:27.437
This isn't... You...

11:27.472 --> 11:29.059
I'm telling my boss.

11:29.094 --> 11:30.361
Great! And I'm telling mine!

11:31.165 --> 11:32.963
She, uh... She always talk
to cops like that?

11:34.233 --> 11:36.367
Only the ones she went to prom with.

11:36.402 --> 11:39.469
Pair up. No freelancers.

11:39.504 --> 11:40.903
Nobody goes off on their own.

11:40.938 --> 11:41.904
Understood?

11:47.445 --> 11:49.078
Fire's in there... we're out here.

11:49.113 --> 11:50.155
What's our next move?

11:50.191 --> 11:51.647
Think faster. What's our move?

11:51.683 --> 11:53.983
Uh, uh. Break the glass,
create a point of access?

11:54.018 --> 11:55.048
All right, good. Watch out.

11:57.521 --> 11:59.388
All right. Door open or shut?

11:59.423 --> 12:00.989
- Shut?
- Is that a question?

12:01.024 --> 12:03.024
Shut! Uh, maintain a protective barrier

12:03.059 --> 12:04.025
between us and the flames.

12:04.060 --> 12:05.894
Good. We'll hit her from here.

12:17.707 --> 12:19.039
Now we go in?

12:19.074 --> 12:20.040
Now we go in.

12:25.247 --> 12:29.082
Careful. Watch for active flame.

12:29.118 --> 12:31.017
Low visibility.

12:31.052 --> 12:32.919
It'll be slow going. Stay close.

12:32.954 --> 12:34.421
Copy that.

12:48.502 --> 12:51.069
Found a kid's room. Gonna double-check...

12:51.104 --> 12:52.738
make sure no one's hiding.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.407
Hello?

12:55.443 --> 12:57.776
Anyone in here?

12:59.012 --> 13:00.646
We're clear in here, Captain.

13:00.681 --> 13:01.980
Coming out to rejoin you.

13:02.015 --> 13:04.214
How's your sweep?

13:06.185 --> 13:07.284
Captain?

13:10.089 --> 13:11.355
Captain?

13:14.928 --> 13:16.293
Herrera, you there?

13:16.329 --> 13:17.662
Go ahead. What do you need?

13:17.697 --> 13:19.129
- I lost him.
- What?

13:19.165 --> 13:21.164
I lost him, Andy.
I can't find him anywhere.

13:21.199 --> 13:22.766
I lost your dad.

13:27.330 --> 13:29.016
How the hell did you get separated?!

13:29.041 --> 13:31.042
- He said not to go off on your own.
- I know.

13:31.043 --> 13:32.009
Where have you looked already?

13:32.044 --> 13:34.232
Kid's room, kitchen, and I
doubled back through here.

13:34.257 --> 13:35.489
All right, let's case each room again,

13:35.525 --> 13:36.824
inch by inch.

13:43.799 --> 13:45.999
Maya;

13:46.035 --> 13:47.167
Ow!

13:47.203 --> 13:48.438
Maya, what?

13:48.473 --> 13:49.836
Get over here!

13:54.209 --> 13:56.843
Hey! Come on.

13:56.878 --> 13:58.778
Grab his tank.
We'll get him into the hallway.

13:58.813 --> 14:00.280
Grab it!

14:00.315 --> 14:02.148
We'll manage him down the stairs
from there.

14:02.183 --> 14:03.450
Stop!

14:03.485 --> 14:05.803
No, we don't have time. We don't
know how long he's been down for.

14:05.838 --> 14:07.319
- He's not breathing.
- We don't know that yet.

14:07.355 --> 14:08.820
That's why we need to get him
out of here quickly.

14:08.856 --> 14:11.457
Not him... it.
Look up... look at the smoke.

14:13.694 --> 14:14.860
It's swirling down.

14:14.895 --> 14:16.049
It's choking.

14:16.084 --> 14:17.329
The fire's not breathing.

14:17.365 --> 14:18.697
We're at flashpoint.

14:18.733 --> 14:20.499
- Damn it, come on.
- We gotta move!

14:20.534 --> 14:22.667
Go, go, go!

14:31.511 --> 14:34.111
We got about 5 or 6 minutes
before that door's gone

14:34.147 --> 14:35.780
and this room ignites, too.

14:35.815 --> 14:37.682
We gotta get out of here!

14:37.717 --> 14:38.992
No way out but the window.

14:39.028 --> 14:40.317
- Window won't work.
- Guys.

14:40.352 --> 14:42.852
As soon as we open it and introduce
oxygen into this room...

14:42.888 --> 14:44.278
- Boom.
- Guys!

14:44.314 --> 14:45.822
The Captain doesn't have a pulse.

14:48.394 --> 14:49.673
Help me get his turnout gear open!

14:49.708 --> 14:51.695
Andy, if we do that
and this place explodes...

14:51.730 --> 14:53.997
Then he's dead, anyway.
Help me get it off!

14:55.000 --> 14:56.632
- Take the tank off.
- We got to get the button.

14:56.668 --> 14:58.066
Ohh.

15:02.239 --> 15:03.572
Fire's at the door.

15:03.608 --> 15:04.807
We got, I don't know,
2 minutes, maybe less.

15:04.842 --> 15:06.269
This building has fire escapes.

15:06.304 --> 15:08.787
- If we could get to them...
- Can't make the jump from this angle,

15:08.822 --> 15:10.062
especially not carrying the Captain.

15:10.097 --> 15:11.213
Mayday. Ladder 19.

15:11.248 --> 15:13.081
We need a jumper, Charlie-Delta side.

15:13.117 --> 15:14.716
I repeat... Mayday.

15:14.751 --> 15:16.115
Anybody copy?

15:16.151 --> 15:18.085
One way or another,
we're getting out of here.

15:18.121 --> 15:19.793
I'm making an anchor point.

15:19.828 --> 15:21.556
- Gibson...
- I'll start the harness.

15:35.871 --> 15:37.609
Flames at the door.

15:37.636 --> 15:38.936
We gotta go now!

15:38.971 --> 15:40.103
Harness or not. Andy!

15:40.139 --> 15:41.438
- No.
- Andy.

15:41.473 --> 15:44.374
Nobody leaves until he has a pulse!

15:56.988 --> 15:59.021
- Pulse! I've got a pulse!
- Let's go!

16:03.061 --> 16:04.293
1, 2, 3.

16:06.830 --> 16:08.263
- Get him up. Get him up.
- We've got it.

16:08.298 --> 16:10.431
The fire's starved for air.

16:10.467 --> 16:12.367
As soon as we break the glass,
it'll light up.

16:12.402 --> 16:14.435
So we jump. Fast as we can.

16:14.471 --> 16:15.871
Fly or fry.

16:15.906 --> 16:17.168
No helmets.

16:18.441 --> 16:19.741
We gotta be exact.

16:19.776 --> 16:22.376
No margin of error down there.

16:22.411 --> 16:23.508
Time's up, you guys.

16:24.247 --> 16:25.880
- We'll make it!
- We better.

16:25.915 --> 16:27.014
Guys. Are we doing this?

16:56.810 --> 16:58.310
I can't believe that worked.

17:19.565 --> 17:21.332
Are you okay?

17:21.367 --> 17:23.968
Oh, he lost his pulse.
He's in danger of clotting.

17:24.002 --> 17:25.536
We need to start a drip line,
get him on heparin.

17:25.570 --> 17:27.671
No. We need to get him on O2
and O2 only, all right?

17:27.705 --> 17:29.773
Let's go. Let's go right now.

17:37.249 --> 17:38.514
You all right?

17:56.100 --> 17:57.566
Breathe, Andrea.

17:57.601 --> 17:59.401
You're outside. You got him out.

17:59.437 --> 18:00.502
You can breathe now.

18:01.839 --> 18:04.472
Just breathe, okay?

18:06.443 --> 18:09.177
Breathe.

18:09.212 --> 18:11.079
- Okay.

18:17.176 --> 18:19.511
You're all right.

18:19.622 --> 18:22.555
- Okay.

18:22.591 --> 18:25.592
Let's get him to the hospital,

18:25.627 --> 18:27.494
right damn now!

18:34.697 --> 18:36.898
BP's 80/50... that's low.

18:36.933 --> 18:38.532
Does he have a history
of cardiac distress?

18:38.567 --> 18:39.700
You coulda killed him.

18:39.735 --> 18:40.861
Excuse me?

18:40.897 --> 18:42.803
You can't start a patient
on blood thinners

18:42.838 --> 18:43.905
in the field.

18:43.940 --> 18:45.439
You don't know his history

18:45.474 --> 18:47.107
or if he suffered any underlying trauma.

18:47.142 --> 18:48.166
And if he has?

18:48.201 --> 18:50.110
You're looking at internal hemorrhages,

18:50.145 --> 18:51.978
cranial bleeding...

18:52.014 --> 18:54.447
we can't treat a brain bleed on this rig.

18:54.909 --> 18:56.649
You would've killed him

18:56.684 --> 18:57.951
right in front of his daughter.

18:58.662 --> 19:00.387
What we can treat on this rig

19:00.422 --> 19:01.654
and what you do in the OR

19:01.689 --> 19:03.222
are two very different things.

19:07.213 --> 19:08.794
We're here.

19:25.878 --> 19:27.116
62-year-old male,

19:27.152 --> 19:28.779
found unconscious at the scene of a fire,

19:28.815 --> 19:31.015
possible smoke inhalation.

19:31.051 --> 19:32.650
He collapsed while on duty,

19:32.685 --> 19:34.252
arrested and resuscitated on the scene.

19:34.287 --> 19:36.120
Okay.

19:36.156 --> 19:38.121
On my count... 3.

19:38.157 --> 19:41.024
And 1... 2... 3.

19:47.275 --> 19:48.660
We need an EKG.

19:57.541 --> 20:00.509
Okay, I'm gonna need
a portable ultrasound.

20:06.384 --> 20:07.850
- You should get some O2.
- I'm fine.

20:07.885 --> 20:09.352
- No, you're not.
- Yeah.

20:09.387 --> 20:11.293
- Okay, you're right. I'm really not.
- You're mad.

20:12.189 --> 20:14.489
- Me too. I'm mad at myself.
- No, you...

20:14.524 --> 20:16.024
you shouldn't have split off on your own.

20:16.059 --> 20:17.025
You should've been paying more attention.

20:17.060 --> 20:19.060
I was paying attention.
I saw a kid's room.

20:19.096 --> 20:20.628
- You know how kids hide.
- You... You do this.

20:20.663 --> 20:22.063
You... You jump into things

20:22.099 --> 20:23.898
without thinking them through,

20:23.933 --> 20:25.733
- without consulting anybody first.
- Don't do that.

20:25.768 --> 20:27.135
Don't mix it all up.

20:27.170 --> 20:28.302
I'm not mixing up anything.

20:28.337 --> 20:29.803
You were careless and reckless.

20:29.838 --> 20:31.538
You're mad about before.

20:31.573 --> 20:32.806
And the ring.

20:32.841 --> 20:35.376
- And now you're scared about your dad.
- Are you kidding me?

20:35.411 --> 20:37.311
You think I care even a little

20:37.346 --> 20:39.846
about a stupid engagement ring right now

20:39.882 --> 20:42.049
- when my dad may not wake up?!
- No, that's not...

20:42.084 --> 20:44.318
You left him in the middle of a fire!

20:44.353 --> 20:45.851
I know! I know!

20:59.600 --> 21:00.833
Herrera?

21:00.868 --> 21:02.600
Hi.

21:02.636 --> 21:04.369
I heard your dad was down here.

21:04.405 --> 21:05.837
I just wanted to check in.

21:05.872 --> 21:08.106
Bailey's taking him up for an ex-lap,

21:08.142 --> 21:09.841
and I thought I would join.

21:09.876 --> 21:11.109
You okay?

21:17.817 --> 21:19.950
Let's go.

22:01.858 --> 22:05.060
Okay, that's enough.

22:07.164 --> 22:08.564
Put your game face on.

22:08.599 --> 22:11.065
We got your dad.
Now you go be brave for him.

22:11.101 --> 22:12.066
Okay?

22:12.102 --> 22:14.102
- Okay.

22:41.196 --> 22:42.996
He did great.

22:43.031 --> 22:44.163
Thank you so much.

22:44.198 --> 22:45.258
- That's great.
- Thank you.

22:46.367 --> 22:48.033
Andy, I need to speak with you alone

22:48.068 --> 22:49.560
for a minute.

22:58.513 --> 23:00.779
How long was I out?

23:07.754 --> 23:10.289
Peritoneal mesothelioma.

23:10.823 --> 23:14.325
Tumors in your abdomen... bleeding.

23:14.361 --> 23:16.161
I know because I wrote it all down.

23:16.754 --> 23:18.922
It's why you passed out.

23:19.665 --> 23:21.965
You have cancer, Dad.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.900
- Stage 2.
- Andrea.

23:23.935 --> 23:26.370
Symptoms include,
in order of escalation...

23:26.405 --> 23:29.005
stomach pain, fatigue,

23:29.041 --> 23:31.241
loss of appetite, irritability,

23:31.277 --> 23:33.043
cardiac arrest.

23:34.746 --> 23:37.746
How many of these have you been having?

23:37.782 --> 23:39.048
Were you ignoring them

23:39.083 --> 23:40.749
or just neglecting to tell me?

23:40.785 --> 23:42.985
I have to step down as Captain,

23:43.020 --> 23:44.086
effective immediately.

23:44.121 --> 23:45.321
Did you already know about this?

23:45.356 --> 23:48.658
There's no time to be angry, m'ija.

23:48.693 --> 23:50.359
I don't have that time.

23:50.395 --> 23:52.194
We don't.

23:53.430 --> 23:54.929
The Department will take a while

23:54.964 --> 23:57.265
to fill the post, of course...

23:57.301 --> 23:59.234
they always do.

23:59.269 --> 24:00.320
Gibson'll...

24:00.355 --> 24:03.171
will have to run the place till they do.

24:03.207 --> 24:05.073
You're leaving Jack in charge?

24:05.108 --> 24:06.908
He's my Lieutenant.

24:06.943 --> 24:09.376
Now, go on.

24:09.412 --> 24:11.204
Let me sleep.

24:14.450 --> 24:15.949
Dad.

24:15.984 --> 24:17.050
Dad.

24:49.815 --> 24:51.648
- What are you doing here?
- I have lived next door

24:51.684 --> 24:53.236
for pretty much our entire lives.

24:53.271 --> 24:54.885
No, your parents live there.

24:54.920 --> 24:56.519
You moved away years ago.

24:56.555 --> 24:58.119
And... I moved back in. Last week.

24:58.154 --> 25:00.823
Well, yesterday, technically,
is when I moved all my stuff,

25:00.858 --> 25:02.858
but it's only temporary,
and none of that matters.

25:02.894 --> 25:04.526
At all, because...

25:05.897 --> 25:06.996
How's your dad?

25:07.031 --> 25:08.064
Is he okay?

25:08.099 --> 25:10.566
- How are you?
- Oh, I am fine, actually.

25:10.602 --> 25:11.667
Today's been great.

25:11.703 --> 25:12.936
I'm fantastic.

25:12.972 --> 25:14.870
Uh, I turned down a marriage proposal,

25:14.906 --> 25:16.738
my dad came this close
to getting killed...

25:16.773 --> 25:18.773
so did I, for that
matter... but who cares?

25:18.809 --> 25:20.842
'Cause it turns out
my dad's filled with cancer

25:20.877 --> 25:22.711
and promoting my would-be fiancé
to be my new boss.

25:22.746 --> 25:25.680
Everyone's making decisions
about my life without me,

25:25.716 --> 25:27.315
so, yeah, my world's falling apart,

25:27.350 --> 25:29.651
I'm on my third load of laundry
and as many beers.

25:29.686 --> 25:32.854
Things are great. Today's... great.

25:34.090 --> 25:35.656
Come on in.

25:36.185 --> 25:37.658
Your dad's stepping down?

25:37.693 --> 25:39.927
- Cancer, Ryan. Keep up.
- Yeah, okay, about...

25:39.962 --> 25:41.729
I mean, Jack will just take over.

25:41.764 --> 25:45.165
Never mind that he's impulsive and rash.

25:45.652 --> 25:47.534
I mean, half that job is filing reports.

25:47.569 --> 25:48.836
He's never filed a report.

25:48.871 --> 25:50.070
You wanna know how I know?

25:50.106 --> 25:51.738
'Cause I file them.

25:51.773 --> 25:53.606
- So you do it.
- What?

25:53.642 --> 25:55.608
You should take over for your dad.

25:55.644 --> 25:57.209
- Right.
- Why not?

25:57.245 --> 25:59.445
You're about as badass as they come.

25:59.480 --> 26:01.213
You've literally been training
your entire life.

26:01.249 --> 26:02.381
It doesn't work like that.

26:02.416 --> 26:04.951
- Jack made Lieutenant before me.
- And who decides on that?

26:04.986 --> 26:06.185
Your dad?

26:06.188 --> 26:07.886
What are you saying?

26:07.911 --> 26:09.711
Look...

26:09.790 --> 26:11.757
I love your dad, and I always have.

26:11.792 --> 26:13.347
You know that.

26:13.994 --> 26:16.128
But he loves having you around
to take care of things,

26:16.163 --> 26:19.765
which is different than...
letting you lead them.

26:24.149 --> 26:25.943
Mm.

26:28.808 --> 26:31.642
Doctors think he's probably been
sick for a while.

26:33.646 --> 26:34.879
- Has he had any symptoms?
- I don't know.

26:34.914 --> 26:36.411
He didn't tell me.

26:37.083 --> 26:38.282
I live with him.

26:38.317 --> 26:39.917
I clean up after him.

26:39.952 --> 26:41.185
I do his damn laundry.

26:41.220 --> 26:42.426
He didn't tell you about
something like this?

26:42.451 --> 26:43.610
- Apparently not.
- What the hell?

26:43.645 --> 26:44.954
Exactly! It pisses me off!

26:44.990 --> 26:46.122
- Me too! For you!
- Thank you!

26:46.158 --> 26:47.123
You're welcome!

26:51.930 --> 26:54.130
For real, though.

26:55.934 --> 26:57.224
I'm sorry.

27:08.112 --> 27:10.278
I can't do it again, Ryan.

27:12.883 --> 27:15.855
I can't bury another parent.

27:16.997 --> 27:18.829
It'll be different this time.

27:19.622 --> 27:20.747
Before...

27:21.818 --> 27:23.317
You were 9.

27:23.342 --> 27:25.475
We were 9.

27:34.970 --> 27:37.037
Andy, you've been drinking and...

27:37.072 --> 27:39.940
Well, we're not
in high school anymore, Ryan,

27:39.975 --> 27:41.108
and I'm not drunk.

27:42.144 --> 27:43.877
I'm not.

27:43.912 --> 27:45.311
Come on. Try me.

27:45.347 --> 27:47.347
Give me a Breathalyzer if you want.

27:47.382 --> 27:48.615
Go on.

27:48.650 --> 27:50.049
Mm? See?

27:51.085 --> 27:53.152
I know what I'm doing.

28:24.016 --> 28:26.617
So, this is it?

28:26.652 --> 28:28.119
This is it.

28:28.154 --> 28:29.316
Pretty impressive.

28:31.224 --> 28:32.389
What's that look?

28:34.026 --> 28:36.526
Hey, I just gave
your new home away from home

28:36.562 --> 28:38.294
an unsolicited compliment.

28:38.329 --> 28:40.529
Yeah, I know. I just...

28:41.566 --> 28:42.999
I thought I'd be better at this.

28:43.034 --> 28:44.333
I aced my training.

28:44.369 --> 28:46.302
I know trauma medicine.

28:46.337 --> 28:49.305
I figured "I got this,"

28:49.340 --> 28:51.641
but... then, last night...

28:54.779 --> 28:56.044
...I messed up, Miranda.

28:56.510 --> 28:58.313
I mean, it could've been really bad.

28:58.348 --> 29:01.183
I wanted to show everybody
how good I was at this,

29:01.218 --> 29:02.384
but, instead, I just...

29:02.419 --> 29:03.752
That's your problem right there.

29:03.788 --> 29:05.353
Stop showing off.

29:05.389 --> 29:08.390
The only way to prove
that you're any good

29:08.425 --> 29:09.892
is to just be good.

29:17.566 --> 29:20.656
Look, if anyone can do it, it's you.

29:21.971 --> 29:24.438
- Just be good.
- Just be good.

29:24.473 --> 29:25.873
You make it sound so easy.

29:26.456 --> 29:28.408
For some of us, it is.

29:34.082 --> 29:35.304
Hey, is Andy with you?

29:35.340 --> 29:37.951
An hour before shift
starts to go running?

29:37.986 --> 29:39.986
Funny. You're funny.

29:41.156 --> 29:43.290
Did she tell you about the ring?

29:43.325 --> 29:45.257
- Oh, yeah.
- Did she tell you

29:45.293 --> 29:46.425
I wasn't even trying
to give it to her yet?

29:46.460 --> 29:47.893
And she just freaks out,

29:47.929 --> 29:50.429
like it's the stupidest idea
in the world.

29:52.399 --> 29:54.433
You know, I think she was also

29:54.468 --> 29:56.902
kind of freaking out about her dad.

29:56.938 --> 29:58.370
It's not that crazy.

29:58.405 --> 30:00.139
You know, my parents
got married after six months.

30:00.174 --> 30:01.406
They were happy.

30:01.442 --> 30:03.374
And Andy and I are pretty great together.

30:03.409 --> 30:05.076
You know, I'm not a terrible choice.

30:05.111 --> 30:06.410
You're right.

30:06.446 --> 30:08.213
You are so hot.

30:08.248 --> 30:09.380
You can get all the ladies.

30:09.415 --> 30:10.581
That's not...

30:12.819 --> 30:14.552
I don't want that.

30:14.587 --> 30:16.321
I just...

30:16.356 --> 30:17.453
I love her,

30:17.488 --> 30:19.289
and if she doesn't feel it, then...

30:19.325 --> 30:21.391
what the hell? just tell me.

30:27.199 --> 30:28.298
You slept with Ryan?!

30:28.334 --> 30:30.000
And kicked him out
and came to find you and...

30:30.035 --> 30:31.401
Police Officer Ryan?

30:31.436 --> 30:32.484
"Best friends since diapers" Ryan?

30:32.519 --> 30:34.137
Okay, really, it's hard to talk to you

30:34.173 --> 30:35.405
when you're constantly moving.

30:35.440 --> 30:36.438
Hell, yes.

30:36.474 --> 30:38.007
I mean, go after that. He's hot.

30:38.042 --> 30:39.575
Except, there's Jack.

30:39.610 --> 30:41.244
Your jumped your ex
the night your dad almost died.

30:41.279 --> 30:42.811
Been there, seen it naked before.

30:42.847 --> 30:44.613
- It's basically just recycling.
- Is it, though?

30:44.648 --> 30:45.883
I don't know. I mean...

30:45.918 --> 30:48.784
He wants me to tell him
if I don't have feelings,

30:48.819 --> 30:50.619
but I do... I feel things,

30:50.654 --> 30:51.921
just maybe not marrying things.

30:51.956 --> 30:53.521
Okay, okay. No, no. Stop.

30:53.556 --> 30:55.423
You're spinning. Hey, we don't spin.

30:55.458 --> 30:57.359
Not over something like guys.

30:57.394 --> 30:59.127
We are way too awesome for that.

30:59.162 --> 31:00.128
Maya, I'm awful.

31:00.163 --> 31:01.496
No. You feel awful.

31:01.531 --> 31:03.428
There's a difference.

31:04.401 --> 31:05.700
- What's my rule?
- This isn't...

31:05.735 --> 31:07.802
What's my rule?

31:07.837 --> 31:09.214
Embrace the pain.

31:09.249 --> 31:11.805
- But this isn't a workout or anything.
- Embrace the pain.

31:11.840 --> 31:14.141
Go ahead... feel awful for a minute.

31:14.176 --> 31:15.842
Then use it.

31:15.878 --> 31:17.644
That's how I won my medal.

31:17.679 --> 31:19.513
Forget about the boys for now.

31:19.548 --> 31:21.448
Ignore the distractions.

31:21.483 --> 31:24.718
Find your medal and go after it.

31:24.753 --> 31:26.820
The rest will fall into place from there.

31:31.426 --> 31:33.559
- You're very sweaty and wet.
- Mm. I am.

31:33.594 --> 31:35.428
Gross.

31:43.338 --> 31:44.502
What?

31:46.440 --> 31:48.264
Something's different.

31:49.243 --> 31:51.410
Your energy, your whole look.

31:54.581 --> 31:56.214
Something happened.

31:56.250 --> 31:58.383
Something last night.

31:59.286 --> 32:01.419
You got laid!

32:01.454 --> 32:03.254
You have sex swagger!

32:03.289 --> 32:04.454
My energy told you all that?

32:04.490 --> 32:07.024
No, your phone's blowing up,
and I'm nosy.

32:44.962 --> 32:46.128
- What've we got?
- This way.

32:46.163 --> 32:47.429
I've secured the perimeter.

32:47.465 --> 32:50.866
College senior, awake, a little
disoriented... name's Becca.

32:50.901 --> 32:52.633
Some students heard her calling out.

32:52.668 --> 32:53.901
Hi, by the way.

32:53.936 --> 32:55.123
Hi.

32:57.307 --> 32:58.873
Help.

33:05.848 --> 33:09.582
Uh, that... that thing
that happened at my house...

33:09.618 --> 33:12.452
we don't have to talk about that.

33:12.488 --> 33:13.920
Yeah, of course.

33:13.955 --> 33:16.623
Nothing to talk about, anyway.

33:16.658 --> 33:17.896
We're all good.

33:19.428 --> 33:21.094
"We're all good"?

33:21.130 --> 33:23.296
Wait... what do you mean we're all good?

33:27.197 --> 33:29.101
Becca, my name's Andy.

33:29.137 --> 33:30.403
I'm here to help.

33:30.438 --> 33:32.071
I thought this was a shortcut.

33:32.106 --> 33:34.306
It looked like a shortcut last night,

33:34.342 --> 33:35.141
in the dark.

33:35.176 --> 33:37.176
You've been here since last night?

33:37.211 --> 33:39.111
You know how, when you're drunk,

33:39.147 --> 33:40.246
stupid happens?

33:40.281 --> 33:41.680
I do.

33:41.715 --> 33:43.281
I tried to push myself out of here.

33:43.316 --> 33:45.616
I thought I could make it,
but the more I tried...

33:45.652 --> 33:46.851
No, don't... don't do that.

33:46.886 --> 33:48.653
You've sustained crush injuries.

33:48.688 --> 33:50.688
Every time you move, you could
be hurting yourself more.

33:50.723 --> 33:53.124
Just... squeeze my finger, Becca.

33:53.160 --> 33:54.321
- Can you do that?
- Mm-hmm.

33:54.356 --> 33:55.693
Can you gimmie a squeeze?

33:55.728 --> 33:58.296
- Hey. How's it going?
- Fine.

33:58.331 --> 34:00.197
What's wrong? What's going on?

34:00.232 --> 34:01.963
- It's okay.
- I can't breathe! I c...

34:01.998 --> 34:03.633
- Becca.
- The walls are crushing me!

34:03.669 --> 34:04.801
- No.
- Oh, God! Oh, God!

34:04.836 --> 34:06.437
Becca, no, no. Don't move.

34:06.472 --> 34:07.490
- Just...
- Oh, God!

34:07.525 --> 34:09.706
- Just stay calm.
- This is it, isn't it?!

34:09.741 --> 34:12.275
This is how I die... freezing and stuck

34:12.311 --> 34:14.378
between two stupid walls
'cause I was too dumb...

34:14.413 --> 34:15.978
- Becca.
- ...to realize they were crushing me!

34:16.014 --> 34:17.313
No, you're okay.

34:17.348 --> 34:18.714
- You can breathe. Just...
- I can't.

34:18.748 --> 34:20.449
- Just try to breathe.
- I can't.

34:20.485 --> 34:21.984
Becca, you're spinning. Stop it.

34:23.920 --> 34:25.688
Take a deep breath.

34:26.929 --> 34:28.824
And then another.

34:28.859 --> 34:30.626
And then, you just have to decide

34:30.661 --> 34:32.695
that you can do this.

34:32.730 --> 34:34.795
You can figure this out... trust me.

34:34.831 --> 34:35.909
Trust yourself.

34:35.945 --> 34:37.532
You can do this, Becca. You can.

34:37.568 --> 34:41.335
Just relax and let go.

34:49.846 --> 34:51.145
Ohh.

34:51.179 --> 34:52.146
Aah!

34:52.181 --> 34:53.246
That's it.

34:53.282 --> 34:54.880
It's okay. I got you.

34:54.917 --> 34:56.382
Okay, Jack, go, go!

34:56.418 --> 34:57.485
Go, go, go, go!

34:57.520 --> 34:58.586
That's it. That's it.

34:58.621 --> 35:00.754
Yes!

35:07.730 --> 35:09.229
You were great.

35:11.766 --> 35:12.999
You're so good at this.

35:14.736 --> 35:16.636
I am, aren't I?

35:23.711 --> 35:26.608
I know sometimes
you get overlooked by your dad.

35:27.781 --> 35:29.615
For the record...

35:29.650 --> 35:31.362
I notice.

35:32.319 --> 35:34.186
I've always noticed.

35:35.556 --> 35:37.422
And I dunno what's going on
with him and his recovery,

35:37.458 --> 35:41.793
but if I have to... step up,

35:41.828 --> 35:43.661
take over at the station...

35:45.998 --> 35:47.698
...I won't overlook you.

35:48.501 --> 35:50.067
For what it's worth.

35:59.844 --> 36:01.378
Oh, good. It's you.

36:01.413 --> 36:03.046
I swear, if another damn intern
comes in...

36:03.081 --> 36:05.021
I want to be considered, too.

36:05.784 --> 36:07.750
For the Captain position.

36:07.786 --> 36:10.153
If you have to step down...

36:10.189 --> 36:11.321
I want to step up.

36:11.356 --> 36:13.590
Andrea, you have to be a Lieutenant.

36:13.625 --> 36:14.957
You can't just jump ranks.

36:14.993 --> 36:16.792
- Then promote me.
- Just like that?

36:16.827 --> 36:18.661
You've never even applied for Lieutenant.

36:18.696 --> 36:20.829
I've had to focus on other things...

36:20.864 --> 36:22.598
like you.

36:22.633 --> 36:23.965
Me?

36:24.001 --> 36:25.100
Andrea.

36:25.135 --> 36:27.436
It's Ground Zero over and over.

36:27.471 --> 36:29.572
I take care of you,

36:29.607 --> 36:32.741
chase you down, watch your back.

36:32.776 --> 36:35.677
I've been pulling you
out of the rubble my whole life.

36:36.613 --> 36:37.778
But now...

36:40.116 --> 36:42.783
I know I can lead.

36:42.819 --> 36:46.588
I have the skills, I have the experience,

36:46.623 --> 36:48.556
and I want this, Papi.

36:50.938 --> 36:53.069
This is my medal.

36:54.463 --> 36:56.129
I'm putting my hat in the ring.

37:04.039 --> 37:05.639
Gonna swing by the hospital after lunch,

37:05.674 --> 37:06.707
visit the captain.

37:06.742 --> 37:09.174
I, uh, need your keys.

37:10.712 --> 37:12.678
- Yeah.
- No lights. No sirens.

37:12.714 --> 37:14.747
Oh, I'm totally doing the sirens.

37:16.083 --> 37:18.884
Oh. New Guy, 10 o'clock.

37:21.856 --> 37:24.723
Okay, uh, listen.

37:24.758 --> 37:27.726
Uh, I don't think
I'm better than anybody else.

37:27.761 --> 37:28.826
I'm here to learn.

37:28.862 --> 37:30.695
And, yes, I-I'm a surgeon.

37:30.731 --> 37:33.798
And basically all surgeons do
is talk about surgery.

37:34.444 --> 37:35.900
I'm a surgery nerd.

37:35.935 --> 37:37.636
And, uh... And you guys are...

37:37.671 --> 37:39.170
are fire nerds, right?

37:39.205 --> 37:43.206
And I-I don't speak Fire Nerd yet.

37:44.543 --> 37:46.042
But I want to.

37:48.947 --> 37:51.181
Yeah, that sounded a lot better
in my... in my head.

37:54.819 --> 37:56.007
Hey.

37:57.258 --> 37:58.854
You can start by cleaning.

37:58.890 --> 38:00.490
Warren. Heads up.

38:06.105 --> 38:08.615
- Did, um, Did you just call me by my...
- Just start polishing.

38:08.651 --> 38:10.115
- Shut up and scrub.
- Okay?

38:10.151 --> 38:13.403
Most stations don't even
have fire poles anymore.

38:13.438 --> 38:16.037
They're considered too risky.

38:16.072 --> 38:18.039
Better off to just... play it safe.

38:18.074 --> 38:19.874
You're not coming back?

38:19.910 --> 38:22.778
I've got cancer, Jack.

38:22.813 --> 38:24.446
Looking at chemo, radiation.

38:24.481 --> 38:27.916
It's just the way
things work out sometimes.

38:27.951 --> 38:29.884
So, I will be counting on

38:29.920 --> 38:31.787
my two highest-ranking officers

38:31.822 --> 38:32.920
to run the station

38:32.955 --> 38:34.622
until the department appoints

38:34.657 --> 38:36.390
a new permanent Captain.

38:36.426 --> 38:37.958
Two officers, sir?

38:37.993 --> 38:40.260
I'm promoting Andrea
to Lieutenant, as well.

38:42.799 --> 38:44.085
Screw safe.

38:44.120 --> 38:46.934
The two of you will be
in running for Captain.

38:49.238 --> 38:50.937
Try not to burn the place down.

38:57.579 --> 39:01.381
Oh, that's a Lotta meat.

39:01.416 --> 39:02.882
It was a gift for us.

39:02.917 --> 39:04.917
From a friend.

39:04.953 --> 39:07.386
As a thank you for all of our hard work.

39:07.421 --> 39:08.587
Friend?

39:08.622 --> 39:09.888
Dirty dirty texting friend?

39:09.923 --> 39:10.956
Puppy Lady.

39:12.460 --> 39:15.160
- I... I sort of invited her over.
- No!

39:15.195 --> 39:16.795
Dean, you know better than that.

39:16.831 --> 39:18.597
Don't invite the rescues in.

39:18.632 --> 39:19.931
She didn't leave yet, did she?

39:19.967 --> 39:21.144
Is she at your house right now?

39:21.179 --> 39:22.668
- Her house burned down.
- Oh, my God.

39:22.703 --> 39:23.968
- What?
- She had nowhere else to go.

39:25.037 --> 39:26.937
Guys...

39:26.973 --> 39:28.205
we have some news.

39:29.376 --> 39:30.808
My dad is not coming back.

39:30.844 --> 39:33.845
Safe paralyzes you.

39:33.880 --> 39:35.980
He collapsed because
he was bleeding internally...

39:36.015 --> 39:37.948
Safe makes you hold on too tight.

39:37.984 --> 39:39.083
...pretty badly.

39:39.118 --> 39:42.853
For now, we'll be filling
my dad's position in-house...

39:42.888 --> 39:44.788
That's how you get stuck.

39:44.823 --> 39:46.122
Congrats, man.

39:46.157 --> 39:48.992
...by both Jack and myself.

39:50.028 --> 39:51.928
Oh. Okay.

39:53.732 --> 39:57.000
Also, congrats... man.

39:58.870 --> 40:00.673
Look.

40:01.706 --> 40:04.507
My dad's always run things
a certain way around here.

40:04.542 --> 40:08.043
He likes us to chase a rabbit on a track,

40:08.078 --> 40:11.881
but it's just a stupid trick
to keep us all running,

40:11.916 --> 40:13.783
just a stupid prize,

40:13.818 --> 40:15.182
the Pole Day.

40:17.821 --> 40:19.854
I'm done chasing the rabbit.

40:20.443 --> 40:23.057
I am the rabbit.

40:23.092 --> 40:25.627
The rabbit runs because she loves it.

40:25.662 --> 40:29.063
I do this job because I love it.

40:29.098 --> 40:30.263
I don't need a prize.

40:30.298 --> 40:34.367
Every day here is the prize.

40:34.403 --> 40:36.169
Every life saved.

40:36.204 --> 40:39.172
Every fire put out.

40:40.910 --> 40:43.744
We're Seattle firefighters.

40:43.779 --> 40:46.079
Station 19 is where we choose to be.

40:46.114 --> 40:48.381
And that pole belongs to us.

40:48.417 --> 40:50.223
We earned it...

40:50.852 --> 40:52.718
one fire at a time.

40:52.754 --> 40:54.353
Which means

40:54.388 --> 40:56.355
forget how things are usually done...

40:56.390 --> 41:00.159
every day is a damn Pole Day.

41:00.194 --> 41:02.462
Starting right now.

41:05.908 --> 41:07.031
Let's go.

41:08.401 --> 41:09.668
Wait. Really?

41:09.703 --> 41:11.870
Really.

41:26.500 --> 41:28.146
The trick is to breathe in...

41:30.389 --> 41:32.089
...and loosen your grip.

41:34.760 --> 41:37.227
You can't overthink it.

41:39.998 --> 41:41.097
We both know we're in trouble

41:42.233 --> 41:43.275
Gotta grab on.

41:46.437 --> 41:47.937
Come on!

41:52.511 --> 41:53.776
Take the next step...

41:53.812 --> 41:55.478
Oh, no. Your turn.

41:55.514 --> 41:58.046
You can't declare a Pole Day
and not go, too.

42:01.284 --> 42:02.384
Trust yourself...

42:13.430 --> 42:14.682
...and...

42:15.498 --> 42:16.898
let go.

42:16.933 --> 42:17.958
Whoo!
