WEBVTT

00:09.481 --> 00:10.883
Chief Kent is here, sir.

00:12.199 --> 00:15.048
Well, let's have him, Baker.

00:15.049 --> 00:16.415
Thank you.

00:16.417 --> 00:17.515
Hey.

00:17.516 --> 00:18.746
Hey, hey.

00:18.748 --> 00:20.587
Man voted least popular
by the gangs of New York.

00:20.589 --> 00:22.527
(chuckles)
Thank you very much.

00:22.529 --> 00:23.594
Please.

00:23.596 --> 00:25.162
It's an honor.

00:25.164 --> 00:26.835
On the other hand,

00:26.837 --> 00:28.531
you're sending
so much business

00:28.533 --> 00:31.371
over to the DA's office
that they owe you

00:31.373 --> 00:33.338
a thank-you note
and a nice bottle.

00:33.340 --> 00:35.210
And every one is
a good collar.

00:35.212 --> 00:36.505
And by the book.

00:36.507 --> 00:39.912
Then they owe you
a case of nice bottles.

00:39.914 --> 00:42.542
I won't hold my breath.

00:42.544 --> 00:44.246
Seriously, Don,
great work.

00:44.248 --> 00:45.612
Incredible results.

00:45.614 --> 00:46.947
We're getting there.

00:46.949 --> 00:49.577
Briefing said
you're mopping up.

00:49.579 --> 00:50.946
As we speak.

00:50.948 --> 00:53.316
Well, then take a rest
on your laurels for a minute,

00:53.318 --> 00:54.758
starting now.

00:54.760 --> 00:56.623
I'm good.

00:58.034 --> 01:00.164
And how's Maggie?

01:02.072 --> 01:03.638
She's great.
(chuckles)

01:03.640 --> 01:06.447
Taking her out to lunch
today for our 30th.

01:07.281 --> 01:09.912
Congratulations
on that, too, then.

01:10.883 --> 01:12.554
Department should have
a medal for the wives

01:12.556 --> 01:13.692
that put up with us.

01:13.694 --> 01:15.959
I'll work on that.

01:15.961 --> 01:18.730
And let's book a date for
dinner, just the three of us.

01:18.732 --> 01:20.706
That sounds good.

01:20.708 --> 01:22.402
But you know Maggie will want
to bring along

01:22.404 --> 01:23.506
one of her girlfriends for you.

01:23.508 --> 01:25.979
What, she's still on about that?

01:25.981 --> 01:27.243
Same as it ever was.

01:27.245 --> 01:28.643
But you got my back, right?

01:28.645 --> 01:30.979
Until you say otherwise, boss.

01:37.790 --> 01:39.788
Little something
to wear at your lunch.

01:41.758 --> 01:43.164
What did you do?

01:49.540 --> 01:51.209
Wow.

01:51.211 --> 01:53.209
You earned it.

01:53.211 --> 01:55.544
Like father, like son.

01:55.546 --> 01:59.479
As of now, you are
officially a two-star chief.

02:00.481 --> 02:02.280
Don't know what to say, Frank.

02:02.282 --> 02:04.520
Then I'll say it for both of us.

02:04.522 --> 02:07.057
Thank you, Chief Kent.

BAEZ: <i> That's the car</i>
<i>we're looking for.</i>

02:32.436 --> 02:35.268
You guys ever heard of the DMV?
Huh?

02:35.270 --> 02:36.838
Your tag's expired.

02:36.840 --> 02:39.048
Turn off the ignition,

02:39.050 --> 02:41.786
put your keys and the hands
on the dashboard, both of you.

02:41.788 --> 02:43.451
Just write me a ticket, man.

02:43.453 --> 02:46.294
I got a better idea-- how about
you get your ass out of the car?

02:46.296 --> 02:48.159
You, too. Let's go.
DANNY: Come on.

02:48.161 --> 02:51.231
Come on, on
the sidewalk.

02:51.233 --> 02:54.032
Face the car.
Hands on the car.

02:54.034 --> 02:56.274
Anything in the trunk,
tough guy?

02:56.276 --> 02:58.178
Nah.
You mind if we take a look?

02:58.180 --> 02:59.210
You got a warrant?

02:59.212 --> 03:01.442
Don't need a warrant.

03:01.444 --> 03:03.178
What, are you a law
professor or something?

03:03.180 --> 03:05.019
Since when do you ask
all the questions?

03:07.422 --> 03:08.957
There's my warrant.

03:08.959 --> 03:10.726
(keyless lock beeping)

03:18.371 --> 03:20.802
Get on the ground.

03:20.804 --> 03:22.370
Get on the ground!
On the ground, on the ground!

03:22.372 --> 03:23.507
Turn around, get
on the ground now!

03:23.509 --> 03:25.243
Move!
Hands behind your head!

03:26.517 --> 03:27.977
Hands behind your
back. Let's go.

03:27.979 --> 03:29.513
I hope you got
a receipt for those.

03:29.515 --> 03:31.617
The judge will toss this out,
and we'll walk.

03:31.619 --> 03:33.217
You may walk, but you're
gonna have a tough time

03:33.219 --> 03:34.554
explaining how you lost

03:34.556 --> 03:36.354
$50,000 worth
of stolen hardware

03:36.356 --> 03:37.787
to your boss, aren't you?

03:37.789 --> 03:39.660
Now where's your law degree?

03:39.662 --> 03:41.534
Come on, get up.

03:50.408 --> 03:51.941
Hey, what are you
guys doing out here?

03:51.943 --> 03:54.213
Do me a favor-- take your hands
out of your pockets.

03:54.215 --> 03:56.277
Thanks a lot.
Why you hassling us?

03:56.279 --> 03:59.145
We've had multiple complaints
of drug activity on this block.

03:59.147 --> 04:00.881
You guys fit
the general description.

04:00.883 --> 04:01.977
Let me see your I.D.

04:01.979 --> 04:04.913
I want to see
all your I.D.'s.

04:08.323 --> 04:10.289
You got a weapon here?

04:11.123 --> 04:12.626
Man...

04:14.333 --> 04:17.798
What's this, your cold medicine?

04:20.168 --> 04:22.302
Hey, it's Curtis, Eddie.

04:25.009 --> 04:26.544
He got anything on him?

04:26.546 --> 04:28.449
No, he's clean.

04:28.451 --> 04:31.051
Curtis, come here.

04:31.053 --> 04:32.724
What are you doing
out here today, Curtis?

04:32.726 --> 04:34.621
I was just heading to work.

04:34.623 --> 04:35.989
Stopped to talk
for a minute,

04:35.991 --> 04:37.662
and then y'all show up.

04:37.664 --> 04:38.895
Your friends are wearing colors.

04:38.897 --> 04:40.857
What are you doing talking
to gangbangers, Curtis?

04:41.634 --> 04:43.106
They called me over.

04:43.108 --> 04:44.739
They run the neighborhood.

04:44.741 --> 04:46.781
I didn't want to disrespect 'em.

04:46.783 --> 04:48.078
All right, you still working
with your mother

04:48.080 --> 04:49.047
at St. Victor's Hospital?

04:49.049 --> 04:50.784
Yeah.
She talked

04:50.786 --> 04:52.888
to my sister-in-law-- she
asked me to check up on you.

04:52.890 --> 04:54.824
Said she's worried about you
hanging out with bad guys.

04:54.826 --> 04:57.191
Hey, I didn't
do anything wrong, so...

04:57.193 --> 04:59.390
Well, your friends,
they certainly did.

04:59.392 --> 05:02.694
Like I said,
they run the neighborhood.

05:02.696 --> 05:04.566
What else am I supposed to do?

05:04.568 --> 05:06.933
All right, you got a pass
this time, Curtis.

05:06.935 --> 05:09.101
But you got to watch the company
you keep, understand?

05:09.103 --> 05:11.437
Yeah.
All right.

05:11.439 --> 05:13.003
I'm late for work. Can I go?

05:13.005 --> 05:14.234
Yeah, take off.

05:16.339 --> 05:17.936
What do you think?

05:17.938 --> 05:19.272
I think he's a good kid.

05:19.274 --> 05:21.472
Hope it's enough
to keep him out of trouble.

05:24.180 --> 05:26.283
You've got the Brooklyn
borough president at 4:00,

05:26.285 --> 05:28.621
then cocktails
at Gracie Mansion.

05:28.623 --> 05:30.695
Five bucks if you get me
out of drinks with the mayor.

05:30.697 --> 05:33.360

But one of your chiefs

If you ask me,
I say screw the mayor,

08:13.155 --> 08:14.688
the DA, the press
and whoever else

08:14.690 --> 08:16.423
might be looking
over your shoulder.

08:16.425 --> 08:18.222
No one's looking over
my shoulder.

08:18.224 --> 08:20.029
Then why?

08:20.031 --> 08:22.292
When I revised the guidelines
for detectives...

08:22.294 --> 08:25.058
it was Don Kent
who had the most input.

08:25.060 --> 08:26.793
So we do it his way.

08:26.795 --> 08:29.127
Yeah.
That's how we honor him.

08:29.129 --> 08:30.231
Frank.

(siren whoops)

08:37.575 --> 08:39.269

08:39.270 --> 08:42.173
I'm so sorry.

08:42.174 --> 08:43.606
Thomas.

08:43.607 --> 08:45.982
Your mom and dad
were the best of us.

08:45.984 --> 08:48.151
Thank you, sir.

09:09.370 --> 09:11.375
New York City police
chief gets gunned down

09:11.377 --> 09:13.804
in broad daylight and
nobody sees a damn thing?

09:13.806 --> 09:17.245
I got a few descriptions of two
individuals in a black SUV.

09:17.247 --> 09:18.876
Nothing that we can use.
Right.

09:18.878 --> 09:20.347
You spoke to Thomas Kent.

09:20.349 --> 09:22.978
Is there any way this could be
a personal beef against his dad?

09:22.980 --> 09:24.913
Most people don't
settle personal beefs

09:24.915 --> 09:27.144
by carrying out
public executions.

09:27.146 --> 09:30.321
Which makes me think this
is exactly what it looks like.

09:30.323 --> 09:31.417
A gang hit.

09:31.419 --> 09:33.026
Retribution for Chief Kent's

09:33.028 --> 09:34.658
antigang crackdown.

09:34.660 --> 09:36.826
But they got to know it's gonna
bring down the wrath of God.

09:36.828 --> 09:37.995
Ordinarily
it would, but

09:37.997 --> 09:39.865
now One PP
wants our every move

09:39.867 --> 09:41.665
to be right out
of the patrol guide.

09:41.667 --> 09:42.665
I heard that.

09:42.667 --> 09:44.097
Chief Kent was by the book,

09:44.099 --> 09:46.065
so we got to do it
by the book.

09:46.067 --> 09:47.803
I hear a "but."

09:47.805 --> 09:49.075
Course you hear a "but."

09:49.077 --> 09:50.941
Look how it worked out
for Chief Kent.

09:52.848 --> 09:55.120
BAEZ:
We got company.

09:55.122 --> 09:58.089
We'll be working out of this office.
I'll be back.

09:58.091 --> 10:00.028
Hey.

10:00.030 --> 10:01.565
What are you doing here?

10:01.567 --> 10:04.400
DA has set up
a special task force to assist

10:04.402 --> 10:06.472
with the Kent investigation.
I'm heading it up.

10:06.474 --> 10:08.335
Oh. All right, well,
we're just getting started,

10:08.337 --> 10:10.807
so if we need a warrant
or anything, we'll let you know.

10:10.809 --> 10:12.143
It's not gonna
work that way, Danny.

10:12.145 --> 10:13.775
What's that supposed to mean?

10:13.777 --> 10:15.414
I have
instructions

10:15.416 --> 10:18.381
to ensure this investigation
follows the letter of the law,

10:18.383 --> 10:21.314
so when charges are brought,
they stand up in court.

10:21.316 --> 10:23.217
So you're here to babysit.

10:23.219 --> 10:25.184
On whose orders?

10:25.186 --> 10:26.848
The DA, the mayor.

10:26.850 --> 10:29.686
The powers that be
want to make sure this

10:29.688 --> 10:32.653
entire investigation
is done by the book.

10:32.655 --> 10:34.253
So?

10:34.255 --> 10:36.357
So I'm the book.

10:41.768 --> 10:44.366
Chief Kent served
this department with honor

10:44.368 --> 10:46.903
and distinction for 33 years.

10:46.905 --> 10:50.742
He and his wife Maggie
both committed their lives

10:50.744 --> 10:53.708
to making this city
a better place.

10:53.710 --> 10:56.411
And they will be sorely missed.

10:56.413 --> 10:58.547
For the record...

10:58.549 --> 11:00.441
MAN: Commissioner? This
incident is being referred to

11:00.443 --> 11:02.848
as an execution--
is that accurate?

11:02.850 --> 11:04.649
"Execution," assassination,

11:04.651 --> 11:07.986
massacre-- you can call it
what you want.

11:07.988 --> 11:11.322
It is certainly
the most barbaric assault

11:11.324 --> 11:13.192
targeting this department

11:13.194 --> 11:16.453
that I have seen
in all my years on the job.

11:16.455 --> 11:18.125
Do you believe
this is retribution

11:18.127 --> 11:20.556
for the department's recent
antigang initiative?

11:20.558 --> 11:22.429
If they were gang members.

11:22.431 --> 11:24.661
At this moment,
affiliation and motive

11:24.663 --> 11:27.533
run a distant second
to finding who did this

11:27.535 --> 11:29.533
and bringing them in.

11:29.535 --> 11:31.541
Do you consider this
part of a recent pattern

11:31.543 --> 11:33.878
of tension between
the public and police?

11:36.545 --> 11:39.447
Seriously?

11:39.449 --> 11:41.844
Is that a real question?

11:41.846 --> 11:43.883
Here? Now?

11:43.885 --> 11:46.282
Yes, sir. Certainly the
commissioner is aware...

11:46.284 --> 11:49.248
The commissioner is aware

11:49.250 --> 11:51.815
that a chief and his wife

11:51.817 --> 11:55.592
were gunned down in cold blood.

11:55.594 --> 11:58.394
If you need someone
to frame that

11:58.396 --> 12:00.396
in some larger narrative,

12:00.398 --> 12:02.437
I'm not your guy today.

12:05.875 --> 12:09.083
For the record, I consider this
a double homicide

12:09.085 --> 12:13.753
and a tragic personal loss
for myself

12:13.755 --> 12:15.953
and this department.

12:15.955 --> 12:18.153
(reporters clamoring)

12:22.165 --> 12:23.868
Chief and his wife exit here.

12:23.870 --> 12:26.198
Make their way down
to the sidewalk.

12:26.200 --> 12:28.135
Driver's facing the door,
so he doesn't see

12:28.137 --> 12:29.903
the shooter
approaching in an SUV.

12:29.905 --> 12:32.743
Pop, pop, pop--
they get hit here.

12:32.745 --> 12:34.679
Shooter makes a clean getaway.

12:36.983 --> 12:38.979
Were you working
yesterday...

12:38.981 --> 12:40.083
Trent?

12:40.085 --> 12:42.282
Negative.
My boy Hector had the com.

12:42.284 --> 12:43.482
That would be Hector Florez?

12:43.484 --> 12:44.817
That it would.
Hector hasn't been

12:44.819 --> 12:46.681
interviewed yet.
Do you know where he is?

12:46.683 --> 12:48.521
He flaked, and they called me in
to cover.

12:48.523 --> 12:50.426
I was supposed
to rehearse with my band.

12:50.428 --> 12:51.722
Oh, you missed band practice,
huh?

12:51.724 --> 12:53.093
What a tragedy.

12:53.095 --> 12:55.398
How about you just tell us
where Hector Florez is?

12:55.400 --> 12:56.735
I heard he's at St. Victor's.

12:56.737 --> 12:58.738
He's in the hospital?
Well, you didn't think

12:58.740 --> 13:00.676
to tell us that
in the first place?

13:00.678 --> 13:02.247
Chill, dude. I just did.

13:02.249 --> 13:04.017
How about you chill, dude?

13:04.019 --> 13:06.659
Okay. Thank you, Trent.

13:06.661 --> 13:08.756
Come on. Let's go.

13:13.167 --> 13:15.995
Like I said, Ma, they're
just friends of mine.

13:15.997 --> 13:18.131
The kind of friends
who get stopped by the police?

13:18.133 --> 13:19.803
They're going to put you
in danger, Curtis.

13:19.805 --> 13:22.372
I'm a lot safer if they like me
than if they don't, Ma.

13:22.374 --> 13:24.476
You need to
trust me.

13:24.478 --> 13:28.243
Uh, sorry. Faith, Dr.
Taylor's asking for you.

13:28.245 --> 13:29.977
We're not done, young man.

13:35.353 --> 13:36.816
You had to tell her?

13:36.818 --> 13:38.753
Your mom's my friend, Curtis.

13:38.755 --> 13:40.519
She's worried about you.

13:40.521 --> 13:42.821
Yeah, but she doesn't know what
it's like for me on the streets.

13:42.823 --> 13:43.989
Well, she's trying.

13:43.991 --> 13:45.523
She just wants you to be safe.

13:45.525 --> 13:47.257
You got to
be careful.

13:47.259 --> 13:48.888
You're as bad as she is.

13:48.890 --> 13:51.958
Well, us overprotective moms
got to stick together.

13:51.960 --> 13:54.294
Now get back to work.

13:56.431 --> 13:57.756
Hey.

13:57.758 --> 13:59.361
What are you
doing here?

13:59.363 --> 14:01.527
You got a patient here,
a Hector Florez?

14:01.529 --> 14:04.157
Yeah. Came into the E.R.
last night.

14:04.159 --> 14:05.859
Gunshot wound to the abdomen.

14:05.861 --> 14:06.963
What happened?

14:06.965 --> 14:09.130
Claims he was cleaning his gun
and it went off,

14:09.132 --> 14:11.298
but the wound doesn't appear
to be self-inflicted.

14:11.300 --> 14:13.098
Did you guys report it?

14:13.100 --> 14:15.803
Yeah. But with the chief
and his wife getting shot,

14:15.805 --> 14:17.836
no one's been down
to question him.

14:17.838 --> 14:20.572
Great. We'll take care of that
right now.

14:20.574 --> 14:22.311
<i>So you were working</i>
<i>the parking stand</i>

14:22.313 --> 14:24.511
when Chief Kent and his wife
were killed?

14:24.513 --> 14:26.520
Yeah. He was a real nice guy,
you know?

14:26.522 --> 14:30.154
He tipped me just for opening
the car door when they came in.

14:30.156 --> 14:31.891
Not everyone does that.

14:31.893 --> 14:34.595
What did you see, Hector?
Well, they...

14:34.597 --> 14:36.865
they passed by me when they were
leaving the restaurant.

14:36.867 --> 14:38.329
I thanked them for coming.

14:38.331 --> 14:39.801
And then I heard the shots.

14:39.803 --> 14:42.233
And people started screaming.
It was...

14:42.235 --> 14:44.033
it was crazy.

14:44.035 --> 14:46.272
Did you happen to see
who did the shooting?

14:47.106 --> 14:48.808
Nah.

14:48.810 --> 14:50.177
I hit the ground

14:50.179 --> 14:51.945
as soon
as I heard the shots.

14:51.947 --> 14:54.113
You say
you accidentally shot yourself

14:54.115 --> 14:55.745
while you were cleaning
your gun?

14:55.747 --> 14:58.520
Yeah.
(chuckles) Stupid.

14:58.522 --> 15:00.689
It's also stupid to lie to cops.

15:01.586 --> 15:03.119
I mean,
self-inflicted

15:03.121 --> 15:04.886
gunshot wounds look
a certain way, Hector,

15:04.888 --> 15:06.990
and I got to tell you,
that's not it.

15:08.760 --> 15:10.591
I didn't see nothing, Detective.

15:10.593 --> 15:12.464
Entry wound suggests
you were facing the shooter

15:12.466 --> 15:13.401
when you got hit.

15:13.403 --> 15:15.434
That tells us
you saw something.

15:15.436 --> 15:17.505
I'm willing to bet the slug
the docs pull out of your gut

15:17.507 --> 15:19.673
is gonna match the ones that
killed Chief Kent and his wife.

15:19.675 --> 15:22.576
Hector,

15:22.578 --> 15:24.176
we're not trying
to jam you up here.

15:24.178 --> 15:25.608
We're trying to help you.

15:25.610 --> 15:28.449
But we need you
to help us, too, okay?

15:29.316 --> 15:31.483
(sighs)

15:32.324 --> 15:35.226
You got kids, Detective?

15:35.228 --> 15:37.058
I have two boys.

15:37.060 --> 15:39.090
I got
twin girls.

15:39.092 --> 15:41.992
They just turned three.

15:41.994 --> 15:45.096
I want to watch them grow up.
Hector,

15:45.098 --> 15:46.696
whatever you're afraid of,

15:46.698 --> 15:49.071
we can give you protection.

15:52.504 --> 15:54.973
I'm sorry.

15:54.975 --> 15:57.739
I can't help you.

16:09.125 --> 16:11.231
Listen, your best
isn't good enough, okay?

16:11.233 --> 16:13.127
Now, if you don't get me
the ballistics on the slugs

16:13.129 --> 16:15.334
you pulled from the chief and
his wife in the next two hours,

16:15.336 --> 16:16.662
I'm coming down there myself.

16:16.664 --> 16:18.198
You're not
gonna like it.

16:18.200 --> 16:20.070
Get ready to be happy.

16:20.072 --> 16:22.468
Don't I look happy to you?

16:22.470 --> 16:23.867
Took this off
of surveillance

16:23.869 --> 16:25.938
three blocks away
from the crime scene.

16:25.940 --> 16:27.801
All right.
I'm getting a little happier.

16:28.874 --> 16:30.375
Warrior Kings tattoo.

16:31.671 --> 16:33.540
And they got the guy's face.

16:33.542 --> 16:36.476
That's why God invented
facial recognition software.

16:36.478 --> 16:38.947
Son of a bitch.

16:38.949 --> 16:40.473
Mario Hunt.

16:40.475 --> 16:42.176
This guy's a stone-cold killer.

16:42.178 --> 16:44.079
He's one
of Clinton Wallace's made men.

16:44.081 --> 16:46.510
Head of the Warrior Kings.
Yeah.

16:46.512 --> 16:49.149
He's cooling his jets in Rikers
right now. He's awaiting trial.

16:49.151 --> 16:52.180
But these guys never make a move
without Wallace's blessing.

16:52.182 --> 16:54.147
You think Wallace would have
the stones to order Hunt

16:54.149 --> 16:56.082
to take out a police chief
and his wife?

16:56.084 --> 16:57.418
Let's grab Hunt and find out.

16:57.420 --> 16:59.585
I'll be right back.

17:02.795 --> 17:04.289
I need a warrant

17:04.290 --> 17:06.559
to arrest this piece of crap
and to toss his place.

17:06.560 --> 17:07.829
What have you got?

17:07.832 --> 17:09.326
We got him on tape
near the crime scene.

17:09.328 --> 17:10.964
Is that it?

17:10.965 --> 17:13.099
He's a known felon and
a gang member in one

17:13.102 --> 17:15.101
of the most notorious
gangs in the city,

17:15.103 --> 17:17.102
and we got a dead police
chief-- and why the hell

17:17.104 --> 17:18.405
am I answering to you?

17:18.406 --> 17:19.772
ERIN:
You need more, Danny.

17:19.775 --> 17:21.741
Check the file.

17:22.911 --> 17:25.141
The only reason this mutt
is still on the street

17:25.143 --> 17:27.277
is because your office
let him skate twice

17:27.279 --> 17:28.781
on separate manslaughter trials.

17:28.783 --> 17:31.718
Come on, Danny. We wouldn't ask
a judge to issue this warrant

17:31.720 --> 17:33.383
on a regular
homicide investigation.

17:33.385 --> 17:35.521
This isn't
a normal homicide investigation.

17:35.523 --> 17:37.531
We grew up with these people.

17:37.533 --> 17:39.468
It can't be about that.

17:39.470 --> 17:43.135
What...? Is this Dad
talking now or you?

17:44.778 --> 17:47.345
Okay, then, Dad,
do I get my warrant or not?

17:47.347 --> 17:48.712
Not.

17:57.825 --> 17:59.624
Come.

18:04.627 --> 18:06.899
Thought you told me
you weren't with these guys.

18:06.901 --> 18:08.574
I'm not.
We were just hanging out.

18:08.576 --> 18:10.711
Arresting officer said
your pals were selling drugs.

18:10.713 --> 18:12.375
I don't know anything
about that.

18:12.377 --> 18:14.343
How about this?

18:14.345 --> 18:16.647
Yeah, it's no big deal.
They gave it to me.

18:16.649 --> 18:19.046
Actually, Curtis, possession of
an illegal weapon is a big deal,

18:19.048 --> 18:21.151
especially when it's got
Warrior King markings on it.

18:21.153 --> 18:22.920
It's not what it looks like.

18:22.922 --> 18:25.560
Good. Because it looks like
these guys are recruiting you.

18:27.290 --> 18:29.327
Those guys in there make more
in one night

18:29.329 --> 18:32.562
than I do working the entire
month working at the hospital.

18:32.564 --> 18:34.667
Selling guns and drugs.

18:34.669 --> 18:36.539
Trust me, that money
won't do them much good

18:36.541 --> 18:38.939
when they're all dead or in jail
in a year or two.

18:38.941 --> 18:42.139
Look, okay,
they want to recruit me...

18:42.141 --> 18:45.148
(quietly): but I don't want to, okay?
It's not that easy.

18:45.150 --> 18:48.485
Gangs like the Warrior Kings
feed off guys like you, Curtis.

18:48.487 --> 18:51.220
You do the dirty work,
and they get rich.

18:51.222 --> 18:52.923
I appreciate you trying
to help me out, all right,

18:52.925 --> 18:54.523
but I think I know
what I'm doing.

18:56.092 --> 18:58.593
Could've fooled me.

19:05.733 --> 19:07.571
Hey. Wait, wait.

19:08.773 --> 19:11.603
Do you think you could help
me out with the weapons charge?

19:13.413 --> 19:15.547
You want to be a gangbanger,

19:15.549 --> 19:19.148
you should get used
to spending time behind bars.

19:33.882 --> 19:36.478
WOMAN:
Hey, man, watch it!

19:36.480 --> 19:38.046
DANNY:
Move your ass.

19:39.352 --> 19:40.382
Get out of the way.

19:40.384 --> 19:42.086
Mario,

19:42.088 --> 19:43.614
where the hell are you going?

19:43.616 --> 19:46.223
Look, man, I ain't carrying
nothing, all right?

19:46.225 --> 19:48.623
Really? What do you look
so afraid for, huh?

19:48.625 --> 19:50.292
A big-shot cop got hit.

19:50.294 --> 19:53.354
Which means you guys is
out here kicking ass.

19:53.356 --> 19:55.089
That's true. Shoot him.

19:55.091 --> 19:56.288
Whoa.

20:00.595 --> 20:02.433
What the hell is this?

20:02.435 --> 20:04.001
Modern policing. You rolling?

20:04.003 --> 20:05.832
Great.
Mario Hunt,

20:05.834 --> 20:08.536
you're a person of interest
in a double homicide.

20:08.538 --> 20:10.735
Will you willingly submit
to questioning?

20:11.737 --> 20:13.711
You telling me
I ain't gonna get a beating?

20:13.713 --> 20:17.007
Will you willingly submit
to questioning? Yes or no.

20:18.145 --> 20:21.550
Yeah, why not? I mean,
I ain't got nothing to hide.

20:21.552 --> 20:23.981
I'm sure you don't. Turn it off.

20:25.685 --> 20:27.914
I was really hoping
you would've tried to run.

20:27.916 --> 20:30.018
Let's go.

20:36.457 --> 20:39.159
(door slams outside)

20:42.463 --> 20:43.763
(sighs)

20:43.765 --> 20:45.690
Something smells good.

20:45.692 --> 20:47.497
Your mother's beef stew.

20:47.499 --> 20:50.697
I figured you'd be needing some
about now.

20:50.699 --> 20:51.930
Make it to go, will you?

20:51.932 --> 20:55.338
I'm just changing my clothes
and heading back.

20:55.340 --> 20:58.275
Then I won't offer
to buy you a drink.

20:58.277 --> 21:01.148
Wouldn't make a dent anyway.

21:01.150 --> 21:03.350
You okay, Francis?

21:05.290 --> 21:07.393
No.

21:07.395 --> 21:09.724
You'll get 'em.

21:12.767 --> 21:14.734
Not all of 'em.

21:14.736 --> 21:16.470
What's that mean?

21:16.472 --> 21:18.640
It means, yes,
we'll get the guys

21:18.642 --> 21:20.242
who shot Don and Maggie.

21:20.244 --> 21:21.948
At least, I hope we will.

21:21.950 --> 21:23.285
That's what I meant.

21:23.287 --> 21:25.318
But more will
take their place,

21:25.320 --> 21:27.961
and more after them.

21:29.396 --> 21:33.359
And maybe raise the bar
even higher.

21:33.361 --> 21:34.765
What bar?

21:34.767 --> 21:37.826
The bar, the... threshold

21:37.828 --> 21:42.230
where the guy
in my shoes goes...

21:42.232 --> 21:46.426
"They'll do anything.
They'll stop at nothing."

21:46.428 --> 21:48.926
It's an unwinnable war.

21:48.928 --> 21:52.100
You can't let yourself
think that way, son.

21:52.102 --> 21:54.501
I'm not letting myself
think that way, Pop.

21:54.503 --> 21:58.236
It's just kind of rolling
over me in big, cold waves.

21:58.238 --> 22:00.171
But you're built to take it.

22:00.173 --> 22:02.937
Maybe I was.

22:02.939 --> 22:05.735
Maybe I'm not anymore.

22:05.737 --> 22:08.740
This war--

22:08.742 --> 22:12.610
there's no end, no Appomattox.

22:12.612 --> 22:16.840
Francis, I'm gonna say "enough."

22:16.842 --> 22:18.879
Oh, come on, Pop.

22:18.881 --> 22:21.615
You're telling me
there never came a day

22:21.617 --> 22:23.550
where you didn't say "enough"?

22:23.552 --> 22:25.613
Admit it was a zero-sum game

22:25.615 --> 22:27.013
and get the hell out?

22:27.015 --> 22:28.580
No.

22:30.484 --> 22:33.918
Then I'm saying
you're lying to me, Pop.

22:37.916 --> 22:40.280
I'll take some
of that stew to go.

22:45.285 --> 22:47.816
DANNY: These photos place you in
the vicinity of the crime scene

22:47.818 --> 22:49.184
minutes before
the murders took place.

22:49.186 --> 22:51.887
Me and, like, 10,000 other people.
Yeah, well,

22:51.889 --> 22:53.687
none of those 10,000
have a rap sheet

22:53.689 --> 22:55.158
quite as impressive
as yours, tough guy.

22:55.160 --> 22:56.758
Now, what the hell
were you doing

22:56.760 --> 22:58.022
in that neighborhood
at that time of day?

22:58.024 --> 23:00.031
Hanging out with this girl, man.

23:00.033 --> 23:01.967
You know how that go.

23:01.969 --> 23:03.063
What's her name?

23:04.136 --> 23:05.734
Don't know her that well.

23:05.736 --> 23:07.134
You think this is funny?

23:07.136 --> 23:10.104
Nah. I think it's a waste
of my damn time.

23:10.106 --> 23:11.872
Well, why don't you stop
wasting ours?

23:11.874 --> 23:13.977
You've been popped twice
for manslaughter.

23:13.979 --> 23:15.513
Walked both times.

23:15.515 --> 23:18.051
Prosecutors ain't
what they used to be.

23:18.053 --> 23:20.156
Both times, weapon used
was a .45 caliber

23:20.158 --> 23:21.987
semiautomatic handgun.

23:21.989 --> 23:24.188
Same as the one used
to kill the chief and his wife.

23:24.190 --> 23:26.093
There's a million
of those things on the street.

23:26.095 --> 23:28.124
BAEZ: Kent was coming
down pretty hard

23:28.126 --> 23:29.460
on the Warrior Kings.

23:29.462 --> 23:31.267
You guys must have been
pissed off.

23:31.269 --> 23:33.363
Doesn't mean we took him out.

23:33.365 --> 23:35.467
Why don't we just cut
to the chase here?

23:35.469 --> 23:37.801
We know your boss, Wallace,
called you from Rikers Island,

23:37.803 --> 23:39.599
and ordered the hit
on the chief.

23:39.601 --> 23:41.765
I have no idea what
you're talking about, Officer.

23:46.439 --> 23:48.975
There's no officers here,
only detectives.

23:48.977 --> 23:50.648
You're gonna make this

23:50.650 --> 23:52.753
real tough
on yourself, Mario.

23:52.755 --> 23:56.017
Look, we both know,
if you had anything on me,

23:56.019 --> 23:58.490
my ass would already be
in the system.

23:59.356 --> 24:00.594
Look, I'm done talking.

24:00.596 --> 24:05.668
Either arrest me, or let
me the hell up out of here.

24:07.807 --> 24:10.669
Yeah, thought so.

24:10.671 --> 24:11.878
That's right. Beat it.

24:11.880 --> 24:13.510
Bring me back a bottle of water

24:13.512 --> 24:14.813
or something.

24:17.816 --> 24:20.088
I don't give a damn what
that son of a bitch says.

24:20.090 --> 24:21.257
He's our guy.

24:21.259 --> 24:22.625
Maybe, but he's right.

24:22.627 --> 24:25.689
You have no weapon, no evidence
connecting him to this crime.

24:25.691 --> 24:27.129
Listen, we're not
gonna get anything

24:27.131 --> 24:28.593
if our freaking
hands are tied!

24:28.595 --> 24:30.065
We can't do
our jobs!

24:30.067 --> 24:32.496
Okay, we need time
to build a case.

24:32.498 --> 24:34.535
Did you put Hunt's picture
in a photo array

24:34.537 --> 24:35.631
in front of your witness

24:35.633 --> 24:37.165
in the hospital?
Yeah, we did.

24:37.167 --> 24:39.133
He wouldn't I.D. him.
Wouldn't or couldn't?

24:39.135 --> 24:40.637
BAEZ: Hector Florez lives
in the Bronx.

24:40.639 --> 24:42.004
He knows the Warrior Kings,

24:42.006 --> 24:43.740
knows what they're capable of.

24:43.742 --> 24:45.877
I get that he's scared,
and I understand,

24:45.879 --> 24:47.710
but you have no I.D.,

24:47.712 --> 24:49.246
no weapon,

24:49.248 --> 24:51.014
nothing on Hunt.

24:51.016 --> 24:52.518
Give us time, and we'll find it.

24:52.520 --> 24:54.149
Let us hold him for 24 hours.

24:54.151 --> 24:55.685
Based on what?

24:55.687 --> 24:56.989
Based on who
gives a damn.

24:56.991 --> 24:58.420
An old warrant,
a clerical error.

24:58.422 --> 24:59.723
Just put
him on ice!

24:59.725 --> 25:01.786
I can't do that, Danny.

25:01.788 --> 25:04.287
You can't, or you won't?

25:06.592 --> 25:08.556
We let him go now,

25:08.558 --> 25:11.352
he's gonna disappear,
and then we got squat.

25:12.857 --> 25:14.820
I'm sorry.

25:14.822 --> 25:17.015
Cut him loose.

25:37.119 --> 25:39.285
Is it true, Danny?

25:40.088 --> 25:41.454
What are you
talking about?

25:41.456 --> 25:44.025
I hear you had Mario Hunt in
your house and you let him go.

25:44.027 --> 25:46.466
Yeah, unfortunately, it's true.

25:46.468 --> 25:48.131
You like him as the shooter?

25:48.133 --> 25:49.203
I do.

25:49.205 --> 25:50.699
Then how the hell
could you let him walk?!

25:50.701 --> 25:52.604
(sighs)

25:52.606 --> 25:55.541
A lot of cooks in the kitchen
on this one, Thomas.

25:55.543 --> 25:58.215
What the hell's that supposed to mean?
Look,

25:58.217 --> 26:00.552
I got a car
sitting on Hunt 24-7.

26:00.554 --> 26:04.353
He slips up, that joker will be
back in here, I promise you.

26:04.355 --> 26:05.953
How does a gangbanging scumbag

26:05.955 --> 26:08.162
with a sheet a mile long
get released

26:08.164 --> 26:10.795
when there's a cop and his wife
in the morgue?

26:10.797 --> 26:12.468
Can't cross the line right now.

26:12.470 --> 26:13.565
Since when the hell
is there a line

26:13.567 --> 26:14.773
when one of ours gets killed?

26:14.775 --> 26:16.469
I don't like it
any more than you do, okay?

26:16.471 --> 26:18.109
There's rules, Danny.

26:18.111 --> 26:20.006
You know 'em
just as well as I do.

26:20.008 --> 26:21.110
Take it easy, all right?

26:21.112 --> 26:22.646
Rule number one is,

26:22.648 --> 26:23.983
nothing stands in the way

26:23.985 --> 26:26.216
of us just getting justice
for a fallen officer.

26:26.218 --> 26:28.056
I shouldn't have
to tell you that!

26:28.058 --> 26:30.190
I'm doing all I can.

26:30.192 --> 26:31.685
Could have fooled me.

26:32.719 --> 26:35.956
You know, Danny, if it was
your old man in the morgue

26:35.958 --> 26:40.626
or your DA sister, I'd burn
this city down to make it right.

26:40.628 --> 26:43.394
That's what a real cop does.

26:58.206 --> 27:00.674
(door opens)

27:00.676 --> 27:03.041
You wanted to see me?

27:03.043 --> 27:04.576
Yeah.

27:07.346 --> 27:09.943
Your boss tells me

27:09.945 --> 27:12.646
you asked off
the Kent investigation.

27:12.648 --> 27:13.749
That's right.

27:13.751 --> 27:15.316
You mind telling me why?

27:15.318 --> 27:18.481
All due respect, I can't work
a homicide in tap shoes.

27:19.881 --> 27:21.349
Meaning?

27:21.351 --> 27:23.044
And you know what it means.

27:23.046 --> 27:26.514
I'm sorry you find
proper procedure such a burden.

27:26.516 --> 27:27.650
Proper procedure?

27:27.652 --> 27:29.585
You got Erin wrapped around
my neck so tight,

27:29.587 --> 27:30.681
I can barely breathe.

27:30.683 --> 27:32.290
<i>I</i> got her there?!

27:32.292 --> 27:34.754
If that's what you really think,
you need to do your homework.

27:34.756 --> 27:36.258
I did.

27:36.260 --> 27:38.931
There's no way she sets up shop
in a squad without your say-so.

27:38.933 --> 27:42.668
Yeah. Her-her boss asked for
my cooperation, and I gave it,

27:42.670 --> 27:45.900
so I could ask for his
and get it.

27:45.902 --> 27:48.234
And you're done
when I say you're done.

27:48.236 --> 27:50.337
(sighs)

27:52.208 --> 27:54.667
Don Kent was a great cop

27:54.669 --> 27:57.936
who never brought anything
but honor to the job.

27:57.938 --> 27:59.671
Well, we can agree on that much.

27:59.673 --> 28:02.238
Then honor him.
Do your job.

28:02.240 --> 28:04.508
I'm doing my job
the best way that I can.

28:04.510 --> 28:06.204
Oh, get over yourself,
Detective.

28:06.206 --> 28:07.612
Do your job, period.

28:07.614 --> 28:10.915
We're trying to honor Chief Kent
by doing it his way

28:10.917 --> 28:12.243
when we should be honoring him

28:12.245 --> 28:15.250
by trying to find the guy
who killed him and his wife.

28:15.252 --> 28:17.418
We're not gonna do that
by being sentimental.

28:17.420 --> 28:21.257
There comes a time to rule
by fear, and not by the book.

28:25.088 --> 28:27.757
Has that time come?

28:30.063 --> 28:32.094
Then take my shield.

28:33.568 --> 28:36.031
You seem to want it.
Take it.

28:36.033 --> 28:37.231
No.

28:37.233 --> 28:39.471
Then I'm still
your commissioner,

28:39.473 --> 28:42.942
and your request
to reassign is denied.

28:56.547 --> 28:58.049
Hey.

28:59.187 --> 29:01.952
I just got a call from the
hospital administrator.

29:01.954 --> 29:03.287
You're leaving?

29:03.289 --> 29:05.550
I'm taking Curtis down to Tampa.

29:06.993 --> 29:08.254
I heard he got arrested.

29:08.256 --> 29:10.357
Judge let him off
with a warning.

29:10.359 --> 29:13.124
Are you sure things
are gonna be better in Tampa?

29:13.126 --> 29:16.162
No... but that boy
is all I've got,

29:16.164 --> 29:18.625
and I don't know
what else to do.

29:19.899 --> 29:21.497
(quietly):
Come here.

29:22.371 --> 29:24.232
Thanks, Linda.

29:26.169 --> 29:28.071
I couldn't ask
for a better friend.

29:28.073 --> 29:30.606
Oh, stop it.

29:54.708 --> 29:56.776
How you doing there, Hector?
I'm good.

29:56.778 --> 29:58.543
Doc says I should go home soon.

29:58.545 --> 30:00.340
Good for you.

30:00.342 --> 30:02.105
Saw your girls outside.

30:02.107 --> 30:04.542
Yeah. Beautiful family you got.

30:04.544 --> 30:05.941
Thanks.
BAEZ: I bet they're happy

30:05.943 --> 30:07.908
Daddy's coming home.
Yeah.

30:07.910 --> 30:09.410
They say they can't
sleep at night

30:09.412 --> 30:11.145
unless Daddy checks
the closet for monsters.

30:11.147 --> 30:12.345
Yeah, it's a
father's job, right?

30:12.347 --> 30:13.810
Make 'em feel safe.

30:13.812 --> 30:16.114
Yeah.

30:16.116 --> 30:18.818
You, uh... you find the guy
who, uh, shot those people?

30:18.820 --> 30:20.282
As a matter of
fact, we did.

30:20.284 --> 30:22.120
DANNY: Yeah.
Oh. Oh, good.

30:22.122 --> 30:24.551
Unfortunately,
had to let him go.

30:27.361 --> 30:28.992
(sighs)

30:28.994 --> 30:30.728
You're from the Bronx,
isn't that right, Hector?

30:30.730 --> 30:32.159
Yeah.
So, you've seen

30:32.161 --> 30:33.430
firsthand what gangs can do

30:33.432 --> 30:34.631
to a neighborhood, haven't you?

30:34.633 --> 30:35.969
BAEZ:
Drugs, guns,

30:35.971 --> 30:37.666
extortion, murder.

30:37.668 --> 30:39.970
Yeah, you learn to live with it,
and you mind your own business.

30:39.972 --> 30:41.409
DANNY:
Right.

30:41.411 --> 30:43.639
Like when a bunch of gang
members torched an apartment

30:43.641 --> 30:46.007
a few weeks back in Hunts Point,
killing a three-year-old boy

30:46.009 --> 30:48.344
and his grandmother.
BAEZ: Bronx Homicide collared

30:48.346 --> 30:49.712
a couple gang members,

30:49.714 --> 30:51.713
but no one from the neighborhood
would step up and testify.

30:51.715 --> 30:53.890
You got to take care
of your own.

30:53.892 --> 30:55.491
Don't give me that crap,
all right?

30:55.493 --> 30:56.826
You're not taking
care of your own.

30:56.828 --> 30:58.690
You're turning your back
like a coward, Hector.

30:58.692 --> 30:59.721
That's what you're doing.

30:59.723 --> 31:02.097
I mean, how
else could

31:02.099 --> 31:04.298
that same gang turn around
only a week later

31:04.300 --> 31:05.435
and torch another building?

31:05.437 --> 31:08.101
Only this time, right
across the street,

31:08.103 --> 31:10.878
and this time killing
five people instead of only two?

31:13.450 --> 31:15.618
You want to take care
of your own?

31:15.620 --> 31:17.523
You put these animals away.

31:17.525 --> 31:20.590
You put 'em away in a cage
where they rot.

31:20.592 --> 31:22.561
Yeah, these people--
they know who I am.

31:22.563 --> 31:24.066
They approached my wife.

31:24.068 --> 31:26.098
They scared the hell out of her.
You... you're asking me

31:26.100 --> 31:29.136
to put a target on my family.

31:29.138 --> 31:31.367
We are asking you
to do the right thing.

31:34.175 --> 31:36.276
DANNY: You check the
closet at night

31:36.278 --> 31:37.803
for monsters.

31:37.805 --> 31:40.010
So your girls can feel safe.

31:41.842 --> 31:44.542
This is a real monster, Hector.

31:44.544 --> 31:46.710
A real monster.

31:49.186 --> 31:51.049
You want to keep
your girls safe...

31:51.051 --> 31:54.427
you'll help us
put this monster away.

32:09.641 --> 32:11.207
Nice job, Danny.

32:11.209 --> 32:13.615
You, too, partner.

32:13.617 --> 32:15.384
Hey, Esposito,
it's Danny Reagan.

32:15.386 --> 32:17.249
Look, we got a positive I.D.
on Mario Hunt.

32:17.251 --> 32:20.520
I need you to pick him up and
bring him to the house, okay?

32:20.522 --> 32:24.088
What? What the hell
are you talking about?

32:24.090 --> 32:25.392
Where the hell's
Mario Hunt?

32:25.394 --> 32:27.695
We got the warrant squad
and the fugitive task force

32:27.697 --> 32:29.799
working around the clock.
How'd we lose him?

32:29.801 --> 32:31.734
Hunt pulled a fast one
at his apartment building.

32:31.736 --> 32:33.197
Gave 'em the slip.
It happens.

32:33.199 --> 32:36.334
It shouldn't. A prime suspect
in a double homicide

32:36.336 --> 32:38.806
shouldn't be able to waltz away
from police surveillance.

32:38.808 --> 32:40.273
Well, maybe we should've
thought about that

32:40.275 --> 32:42.010
before we turned
the guy loose.

32:49.225 --> 32:51.896
Excuse me, Lieutenant? We?

32:51.898 --> 32:54.432
Well, I'm just saying
this lowlife should've never

32:54.434 --> 32:57.432
seen the light of day
once we got our hands on him.

32:57.434 --> 32:58.967
So you're suggesting
Detective Reagan

32:58.969 --> 33:00.367
would've been better served

33:00.369 --> 33:02.872
if he'd beaten a confession
out of the suspect?

33:02.874 --> 33:04.073
I didn't say that.
It wouldn't hold up

33:04.075 --> 33:05.977
in court,
but what the hell, right?

33:05.979 --> 33:07.746
I didn't mean
to be out of line, boss.

33:07.748 --> 33:10.548
No, you just got
a natural gift for it.

33:10.550 --> 33:12.989
You want blood? Bring me
the head of Mario Hunt.

33:12.991 --> 33:15.789
I didn't say that was my way...
Oh, yeah, you pretty much did.

33:15.791 --> 33:18.999
Tell the chiefs
to turn the dogs loose.

33:19.730 --> 33:21.497
That's an order.

33:32.626 --> 33:36.360
That's the biggest turnout I've
ever seen for a cop's funeral.

33:36.362 --> 33:39.199
I saw shields from Boston,
Chicago, Florida.

33:39.201 --> 33:41.902
Don worked with departments
all over the country.

33:41.904 --> 33:43.335
We doubled our gang convictions
on his watch.

33:43.337 --> 33:46.040
I'll miss the man
more than the cop.

33:46.042 --> 33:48.472
Uh, he used to
take me and Thomas

33:48.474 --> 33:49.744
to Ranger games
at the Garden.

33:49.746 --> 33:52.050
Good people gone too soon.
Yep.

33:52.052 --> 33:55.347
When Danny and I first
got married, Maggie Kent--

33:55.349 --> 33:57.483
she was
the one who, uh,

33:57.485 --> 33:59.988
told me what it was gonna
be like to be a cop's wife.

33:59.990 --> 34:01.556
She reminded me of Grandma.
Mrs. Kent always knew

34:01.558 --> 34:03.123
what to say
to make you feel better.

34:03.125 --> 34:04.796
Yeah, between her and Mom,
we couldn't

34:04.798 --> 34:06.260
get away with anything
as kids.

34:06.262 --> 34:08.469
Didn't stop you from trying.

34:08.471 --> 34:09.733
I'd like to hear
some of those stories.

34:09.735 --> 34:11.469
No, those were
different times.

34:11.472 --> 34:12.974
That's what you
always say.

34:12.976 --> 34:14.007
That's 'cause
it's true.

34:14.009 --> 34:15.442
I remember the night
Mom died.

34:15.444 --> 34:17.051
When we got back
from the hospital,

34:17.053 --> 34:19.453
Maggie Kent had cooked
a week's worth of food

34:19.455 --> 34:20.917
and left it
at the door.

34:20.918 --> 34:22.284
Didn't make a big deal about it.

34:22.286 --> 34:23.283
Didn't even call.

34:23.284 --> 34:25.018
She just did
what had to be done.

34:25.021 --> 34:26.824
You guys know
who killed them?

34:26.827 --> 34:29.685
This... may not be the best time
to get into that subject.

34:29.687 --> 34:30.924
SEAN: But you told us
that you

34:30.926 --> 34:32.658
busted the guy,
then Aunt Erin let him go.

34:32.659 --> 34:35.193
Sean.
FRANK: Sean, there is a difference

34:35.195 --> 34:38.728
between supposing something and
having the evidence to prove it.

34:38.730 --> 34:40.896
DANNY:
Yeah, well, sometimes

34:40.898 --> 34:42.428
they don't give you
the actual time

34:42.429 --> 34:44.761
to find the evidence
you need to prove it.

34:44.763 --> 34:46.056
Who's they?

34:46.058 --> 34:48.462
They being the wise men
who wrote the Fourth Amendment

34:48.464 --> 34:49.726
to the Constitution.

34:49.728 --> 34:51.324
JAMIE: Come on, Erin,
even they knew

34:51.327 --> 34:53.763
that extraordinary times call
for extraordinary measures.

34:53.764 --> 34:55.897
Really? What amendment
is that, Jamie?

34:55.899 --> 34:57.528
This was a chief executed
by gang members

34:57.530 --> 34:58.862
to send a message.
DANNY: That's right,

34:58.864 --> 35:00.324
and you got to send
a message back.

35:00.326 --> 35:02.395
You start breaking the law
to enforce it,

35:02.397 --> 35:04.425
you've crossed the street
to their side.

35:04.427 --> 35:06.757
Exactly.
Well, you tell that to Thomas Kent.

35:06.759 --> 35:08.796
I don't have to.
His dad would've.

35:08.798 --> 35:10.963
ERIN: You want to nail
Mario Hunt?

35:10.965 --> 35:13.027
Why don't you try
some solid police work?

35:13.029 --> 35:14.432
I did solid police work.

35:14.434 --> 35:16.966
I had him in the box
in my squad, you remember that?

35:16.968 --> 35:18.533
Course, 'cause
you're the one that

35:18.535 --> 35:19.828
let him walk right out the door.

35:19.830 --> 35:21.499
You brought him in
on a hunch, Danny.

35:21.501 --> 35:23.066
I brought him in
because he's the guy

35:23.068 --> 35:24.202
that pulled the trigger.

35:24.204 --> 35:26.169
Based on what evidence?
That's enough.

35:28.338 --> 35:31.671
Tearing into each other isn't
gonna do anybody any good here.

35:31.673 --> 35:33.669
You're right.
I'm gonna go back to work.

35:33.671 --> 35:37.140
Danny.
Not on a day like today.

35:38.511 --> 35:40.814
Please?

35:46.858 --> 35:49.520
We sit down together,
we get up together.

35:58.264 --> 36:01.227
And I just printed the first
draft of your dedication remarks

36:01.229 --> 36:03.529
for Chief Kent at
the fallen officers memorial.

36:03.531 --> 36:04.970
Thank you.

36:10.570 --> 36:12.071
Thank you, Baker.

36:17.878 --> 36:20.740
So where's the head
of Mario Hunt?

36:20.742 --> 36:22.748
We don't have him.

36:22.750 --> 36:24.117
Why not?

36:24.119 --> 36:26.253
We haven't let the dogs loose.

36:26.255 --> 36:30.713
I gave you an order
to go all-out 1970s on this.

36:30.715 --> 36:32.049
No, you didn't, sir.

36:32.051 --> 36:33.487
You calling me out, Sid?

36:33.489 --> 36:34.886
No, sir.

36:34.888 --> 36:36.853
You said some things,
but I did not think

36:36.855 --> 36:38.924
they added up
to a direct order.

36:40.893 --> 36:43.090
So you didn't pass my order on?

36:43.092 --> 36:44.185
No, sir.

36:44.187 --> 36:46.391
And why not?

36:46.393 --> 36:48.590
Because I didn't think
it was a good idea.

36:53.093 --> 36:55.596
You just made my point.

36:56.662 --> 36:58.837
I knew that wasn't you
giving that order.

36:58.839 --> 37:01.269
That was a
heat-of-the-moment thing.

37:01.271 --> 37:04.309
I used to have a lot
of those moments.

37:04.311 --> 37:06.941
And I learned the hard way
how to recognize them

37:06.943 --> 37:09.845
and manage them.

37:09.847 --> 37:13.349
I knew Chief Kent was still on
the job because you personally

37:13.351 --> 37:15.612
asked him
to stay on.

37:20.756 --> 37:23.057
Why would you say that?

37:23.059 --> 37:26.194
Because we were at a racket
together back in the fall.

37:26.196 --> 37:28.897
And he was kind of
polling a few of us--

37:28.899 --> 37:31.498
what would you do if you were
up for retirement

37:31.500 --> 37:33.529
and you asked us to stay on?

37:37.834 --> 37:39.640
I wasn't aware he shared that

37:39.642 --> 37:42.103
with anyone else besides me.

37:42.105 --> 37:45.405
Boss, the fact is that
he was still on the job

37:45.407 --> 37:47.036
because he wanted to be,

37:47.038 --> 37:49.939
not because
he had to be.

37:49.941 --> 37:53.579
This is not on you,
no way, no how.

37:53.581 --> 37:55.284
It's my command.

37:56.621 --> 37:58.482
Well, for what it's worth, boss,

37:58.484 --> 38:02.122
we all said we'd stay on the job
if you asked us to.

38:02.124 --> 38:04.121
To a man.

38:10.029 --> 38:11.730
Thank you.

38:17.370 --> 38:19.504
That'll be all.

38:25.981 --> 38:28.210
Guys from the 2-7 stopped
and questioned three

38:28.212 --> 38:30.113
high-level members
of the Warrior Kings.

38:30.115 --> 38:31.913
Let me guess--
none of 'em know Mario Hunt.

38:31.915 --> 38:33.553
Got to hand it
to these guys.

38:33.555 --> 38:36.288
They're murdering dirtbags,
but they're disciplined.

38:36.290 --> 38:38.521
Well, the Warrior Kings got
their own version of omertà.

38:38.523 --> 38:41.056
You speak about gang business,
you die an unnatural death

38:41.058 --> 38:42.928
at the hands
of Clinton Wallace.

38:42.930 --> 38:45.234
So how the hell are we gonna
track down Mario Hunt

38:45.236 --> 38:47.761
if everyone's so damn scared
of Clinton Wallace?

38:47.763 --> 38:49.665
That's just it.

38:49.667 --> 38:52.200
We got to stop operating
from the bottom up.

38:52.202 --> 38:53.704
Let's take a ride, Dorothy.

38:53.706 --> 38:55.808
Where we going?

38:55.810 --> 38:58.242
We're off to see
the wizard.

39:07.726 --> 39:09.220
Mr. Wallace,
I'm Detective Reagan.

39:09.222 --> 39:10.692
This is Detective Baez.

39:10.694 --> 39:12.861
I know who you are.
I'm sure you do.

39:12.863 --> 39:14.896
And I'm sure
you know why we're here.

39:14.898 --> 39:17.033
I take it you still
haven't figured out

39:17.035 --> 39:19.171
who killed your chief
and his lovely wife.

39:19.173 --> 39:21.415
We know who did it.
He works for you.

39:21.417 --> 39:23.215
I don't know
what you're talking about.

39:23.217 --> 39:25.953
We need you to tell us where
we can find Mario Hunt.

39:25.955 --> 39:27.690
That'd be tough.

39:27.692 --> 39:29.891
I don't get out
as much as I used to.

39:29.893 --> 39:32.625
Nothing goes down on the street
without you knowing about it.

39:32.627 --> 39:35.128
I hear things.

39:35.130 --> 39:36.600
And if word came down,

39:36.602 --> 39:38.696
Hunt would be in our custody
within an hour.

39:38.698 --> 39:41.734
The question is:
Why would I do that?

39:41.736 --> 39:43.766
To take the heat
off your operations.

39:43.768 --> 39:46.335
Far as I can tell,
cops are working this case

39:46.337 --> 39:48.304
like they're scared
of their own shadows.

39:48.306 --> 39:49.881
We can cut a deal.

39:49.883 --> 39:52.313
Maybe get some consideration
from the DA on your

39:52.315 --> 39:54.480
murder charge.

39:55.682 --> 39:57.119
That's funny, huh?
Yeah.

39:57.121 --> 39:59.952
NYPD coming here

39:59.954 --> 40:02.151
begging for help
to bust a cop killer.

40:02.153 --> 40:04.056
Used to be

40:04.058 --> 40:06.358
he'd close this door
and beat me

40:06.360 --> 40:08.558
till I stopped breathing
or gave you a name.

40:09.864 --> 40:13.166
But this is not
how we do things anymore.

40:13.168 --> 40:15.733
We're not begging.
We're just asking.

40:15.735 --> 40:17.404
I hate cops.

40:17.406 --> 40:19.636
Always have.

40:19.638 --> 40:22.971
But I always respected how you
took care of one another.

40:22.973 --> 40:26.210
Now you don't even do that.
Where's Mario Hunt?

40:26.212 --> 40:28.841
Y'all might not have
each other's backs anymore,

40:28.843 --> 40:30.777
but the Kings still do.

40:30.779 --> 40:33.281
Even if I gave you Mario,

40:33.283 --> 40:35.114
you got no case.

40:35.116 --> 40:36.683
We got an eyewitness.

40:36.685 --> 40:38.893
(chuckles)
Who?

40:38.895 --> 40:40.822
The guy in the hospital?

40:40.824 --> 40:42.559
(chuckles)

40:42.561 --> 40:45.296
I wouldn't count on him.

40:45.298 --> 40:48.537
You never know when he's gonna
take a turn for the worst.

40:52.811 --> 40:54.744
C.O.!

40:54.746 --> 40:56.407
Yeah.

40:59.943 --> 41:01.908
You know, there's some pizza
in the nurses station.

41:01.910 --> 41:04.043
You should grab a slice.

41:07.018 --> 41:09.048
You all good, Mr. Florez?

41:09.050 --> 41:12.015
(chuckles)
Ready to go home tomorrow.

41:18.024 --> 41:21.221
You know, I wanted
to tell you...

41:21.223 --> 41:24.357
I think what you're doing
takes a lot of courage.

41:24.359 --> 41:26.060
I don't know
how much courage I got.

41:26.062 --> 41:27.300
I'm scared to death, Nurse.

41:27.302 --> 41:31.268
Yeah, but standing up
and telling the truth--

41:31.270 --> 41:32.934
it's the right thing to do.

41:32.936 --> 41:34.543
My wife says I'm crazy.

41:34.545 --> 41:36.480
Just tell her you're doing it
for those little girls.

41:36.482 --> 41:38.448
Yeah.

41:38.450 --> 41:40.515
I want Hector's floor in the
hospital sealed off immediately.

41:40.517 --> 41:43.053
You really think the Kings are
gonna try to take Hector out?

41:43.055 --> 41:45.255
Damn straight I do.
Call it in.

41:45.257 --> 41:47.561
Son of a bitch.

41:50.402 --> 41:53.260
Hey, Curtis, you here
to clean the room?

41:56.005 --> 41:58.298
You okay?

42:03.474 --> 42:05.168
(shrieks)
Oh, my God, no!

42:05.170 --> 42:07.070
What are you doing, Curtis?
Please.

42:07.072 --> 42:09.708
I need you to leave
the room now, Nurse Reagan.

42:09.710 --> 42:11.140
You don't want
to do this, Curtis.

42:11.142 --> 42:12.442
I don't have a choice.

42:12.444 --> 42:13.706
Kids. I got kids.

42:13.708 --> 42:14.874
Put the gun down.

42:14.876 --> 42:16.513
Please, get out.

42:18.852 --> 42:21.249
Curtis, Hector is my patient.

42:22.818 --> 42:25.384
I'm responsible for his life.

42:28.427 --> 42:30.425
I'm not going anywhere, Curtis.

42:30.427 --> 42:31.824
Please don't.

42:36.240 --> 42:38.013
