WEBVTT

00:03.571 --> 00:05.637
(Bird cawing)

00:07.675 --> 00:09.174
It's beautiful.

00:09.176 --> 00:10.659
Awesome.

00:10.660 --> 00:12.143
It looks just like
every other one we sell.

00:12.146 --> 00:14.179
Yes, but this one costs
one-third the price.

00:14.181 --> 00:15.514
Shouldn't we buy
American-made products,

00:15.516 --> 00:17.182
not overseas knockoffs?

00:17.184 --> 00:18.650
Price gouging is rampant
in the funeral market.

00:18.652 --> 00:20.419
It's the only way
to change the system.

00:20.421 --> 00:22.788
Listen to your brother and help
him unload the last ones.

00:22.790 --> 00:25.190
Daddy's boy.

00:25.192 --> 00:27.526
The casket market will continue
to be run by "the big three"

00:27.528 --> 00:30.462
until small funeral home
owners come together.

00:30.464 --> 00:31.797
(Chuckles)

00:31.799 --> 00:33.799
We must think outside
the pine box.

00:33.801 --> 00:35.801
Daughter:
Dad?

00:35.803 --> 00:37.469
You don't like my gallows humor?

00:37.471 --> 00:38.737
Dad, get in here.

00:38.739 --> 00:41.140
¶ ¶

00:43.244 --> 00:44.576
is there damage?

00:44.578 --> 00:46.178
Not exactly.

00:47.281 --> 00:48.614
Someone's been
living back here.

00:48.616 --> 00:50.282
That explains the smell.

00:50.284 --> 00:53.385
Still think international
shipping is worth saving a buck?

00:53.387 --> 00:54.720
Son:
At least they're already gone.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.422
And they only opened one box.

00:56.423 --> 00:58.123
Well, thank goodness,
it doesn't look damaged.

01:01.228 --> 01:02.294
Oh, my god.
Son: Ugh!

01:03.597 --> 01:05.130
They already come
with customers.

01:05.132 --> 01:06.331
That is a good deal.

01:07.301 --> 01:09.301
Gallows humor.

01:11.739 --> 01:14.139
¶ ¶

01:42.303 --> 01:44.803
(elevator bell dings)

01:44.805 --> 01:46.405
(Sighs)
It was supposed to be fun.

01:46.407 --> 01:48.607
I know.
It started out that way.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.442
Bishop:
I know.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.144
Why am I now questioning
my very own existence?

01:52.146 --> 01:54.480
Ooh.

01:54.482 --> 01:55.814
What happened in here?

01:55.816 --> 01:57.483
Someone leave religious tracts
on your desk?

01:57.484 --> 01:59.151
Bishop: I'm helping
Tim apartment hunt.

01:59.153 --> 02:03.522
A new place is supposed to
mark new life, new goals,

02:03.524 --> 02:05.791
personal evolution.
Yes.

02:05.793 --> 02:08.227
Not a sandpit of crushing
self-realization.

02:08.229 --> 02:09.228
No.
Tony: Mm.

02:09.230 --> 02:10.229
That expensive, huh?

02:10.231 --> 02:11.897
Super.
Ridiculous.

02:11.899 --> 02:13.699
I mean, it's not like
Delilah and I are looking

02:13.701 --> 02:15.367
for downton Abbey, you know,

02:15.369 --> 02:17.236
but, I mean, something
with a little bit of space,

02:17.238 --> 02:18.904
maybe close to a park,
would be nice.

02:18.906 --> 02:21.773
I recently downsized
and ended up paying more.

02:21.775 --> 02:23.308
Yeah, that's a bummer.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.427
Hey, did you ever notice
in the elevator

02:25.428 --> 02:27.545
that the vacuum marks go
in two different directions?

02:27.548 --> 02:29.281
(Chuckling):
It's kind of interesting.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.551
You have nothing to add
to our conversation?

02:35.923 --> 02:37.890
Uh... no. I like my place.

02:37.892 --> 02:38.891
Well, of course you do.

02:38.893 --> 02:40.325
It's beautiful and spacious.

02:40.327 --> 02:41.193
Yeah, with a view.

02:41.195 --> 02:42.294
The doorman can be cranky.

02:42.296 --> 02:43.328
How much do you pay?

02:43.330 --> 02:45.664
Huh? Come on,
that's personal.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.666
Over three
grand though?

02:47.668 --> 02:49.935
(Scoffs) Three diesels?
I can't afford that.

02:49.937 --> 02:51.603
A place like yours wouldn't go
for under three

02:51.605 --> 02:53.372
even if the doorman were
a giant cockroach.

02:53.374 --> 02:55.090
Senior told me

02:55.091 --> 02:56.807
that there's two things you
should never discuss at work--

02:56.810 --> 02:58.944
mortgage payments
are the second.

03:00.181 --> 03:02.848
Uh, what?
You own?

03:02.850 --> 03:04.700
Cat's out of the bag.
(Chuckles)

03:04.701 --> 03:06.551
It's a pretty funny story,
uh, actually.

03:06.554 --> 03:09.254
Not ha-ha funny, but, uh...

03:09.256 --> 03:11.256
Wait a second, you had that
place before I got to NCIS,

03:11.258 --> 03:13.625
so you purchased it
when you were a probie?

03:13.627 --> 03:15.227
Bishop:
How?

03:15.229 --> 03:16.228
Loan from your dad?

03:16.230 --> 03:17.229
Generous cougar?

03:17.231 --> 03:19.198
Dead body. At the mortuary.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.365
Tony:
Not exactly a news flash, boss.

03:20.367 --> 03:21.266
Gibbs:
Let's go.

03:21.268 --> 03:22.534
Grab your gear.

03:22.536 --> 03:23.535
So what's the deal?

03:23.537 --> 03:25.204
Was it an inheritance or...?

03:25.206 --> 03:26.872
(Scoffs)

03:30.811 --> 03:33.245
(Camera shutter clicking)

03:33.247 --> 03:35.714
(Siren whooping)

03:35.716 --> 03:37.216
It takes two weeks for
shipping containers

03:37.218 --> 03:38.550
to cross the Atlantic.

03:38.552 --> 03:41.220
And no shuffleboard
on the lido deck.

03:41.222 --> 03:43.689
Just pillows, junk food
and a few fashion magazines.

03:43.691 --> 03:45.490
Which is pretty much nirvana.

03:46.393 --> 03:47.859
For me anyway.

03:47.861 --> 03:49.595
Others might go crazy.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.230
Like our victim.
Yeah.

03:51.232 --> 03:52.364
No obvious cause of death.

03:52.366 --> 03:54.366
Could have been from boredom.

03:54.368 --> 03:57.402
Metro pulled, uh,
an I.D. Out of her pocket.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.705
Name is Sandra billingsley.

03:59.707 --> 04:02.774
A guard at prickwillow
prison in england.

04:02.776 --> 04:04.776
Sounds like a dickens novel.
Love the British.

04:04.778 --> 04:08.714
Doesn't explain why she's
living in a sea container.

04:12.253 --> 04:13.986
These might.

04:18.025 --> 04:20.892
These are prison jumpsuits.

04:22.529 --> 04:25.297
Are we looking at the bad end
of a prison escape?

04:27.334 --> 04:28.667
Mortuary owner:
We are a family business.

04:28.669 --> 04:30.002
Uh, an American business.

04:30.004 --> 04:32.337
And we support other
American businesses.

04:32.339 --> 04:34.106
Usually.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.874
We pass our savings along
to our customers.
Always.

04:35.876 --> 04:37.442
Container was opened
before it arrived?

04:37.444 --> 04:40.312
I assumed the customs
inspectors broke the seal,

04:40.314 --> 04:42.314
but now...

04:42.316 --> 04:44.683
We never saw anybody
go in or out.

04:44.685 --> 04:46.685
Huh. Okay.

04:46.687 --> 04:49.021
Thank you.

04:49.023 --> 04:50.689
Hey.

04:50.691 --> 04:52.691
Our dead prison guard
was taken hostage

04:52.693 --> 04:55.060
in a prison break
three weeks ago.

04:55.062 --> 04:56.528
Nca.

04:56.530 --> 04:58.530
British national crime agency
and interpol

04:58.532 --> 05:01.033
both thought the fugitives
were still in Europe. Oops.

05:01.035 --> 05:03.935
Boss, we got info on our
two missing prisoners.

05:03.937 --> 05:05.904
Uh, the first one
is cassio Chavez.

05:05.906 --> 05:07.506
Murder conviction
three years ago.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.374
And former MI6 officer
Jacob Scott.

05:09.376 --> 05:10.342
Tony:
Espionage in '02.

05:10.344 --> 05:11.810
Real-life spy.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.612
Our dead body, both
prisoners, all brits.

05:13.614 --> 05:15.914
I bring it up because
there's no Navy connection,

05:15.916 --> 05:18.417
so why are we here?

05:18.419 --> 05:19.751
Fornell:
Professional courtesy.

05:20.988 --> 05:21.920
Gibbs.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.922
Hello, Tobias.

05:23.924 --> 05:26.458
I thought you'd want to know
because NCIS are the ones

05:26.460 --> 05:28.627
who put Jacob Scott in prison.

05:28.629 --> 05:30.462
Yeah, uh, we were just
getting to that part.

05:30.464 --> 05:32.964
Evidently now he is
a murderer, too.

05:32.966 --> 05:34.700
But that's just the bad news.

05:34.702 --> 05:35.734
What's the good news?

05:35.736 --> 05:37.369
I'm gonna put him back for you.

05:37.371 --> 05:39.504
Domestic manhunt.

05:39.506 --> 05:42.507
Obviously FBI jurisdiction.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.409
This is my case.

05:44.411 --> 05:45.544
Great.

05:45.546 --> 05:46.878
You couldn't have
just e-mailed?

05:46.880 --> 05:47.879
I wore a hat.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.715
Now I got to do
my hair again.

05:49.717 --> 05:51.483
It's always good
to see you, Gibbs.

05:51.485 --> 05:53.018
If you don't mind,

05:53.020 --> 05:55.354
I have to find
your missing killer.

06:05.099 --> 06:07.532
Tony: Two prisoners escaped
from prickwillow prison

06:07.534 --> 06:08.667
outside London.

06:08.669 --> 06:10.669
During a routine
prison transfer,

06:10.671 --> 06:13.839
they took a guard hostage
and stole the transport Van,

06:13.841 --> 06:16.608
found dumped
near river Blackwater.

06:16.610 --> 06:19.511
When in fact they were headed
to the port of felixstowe,

06:19.513 --> 06:22.981
where they boarded the<i> maelstrom</i>
<i>adventure</i> bound for Norfolk.

06:22.983 --> 06:25.050
Less than three percent
of all containers

06:25.052 --> 06:26.785
entering the U.S.
are scanned by customs.

06:26.787 --> 06:28.687
Thank you
for that fun fact.
You're welcome.

06:28.689 --> 06:32.491
Tony: Once our cons made port, a
hostage was no longer required.

06:32.493 --> 06:33.859
So they likely killed her.

06:33.861 --> 06:35.527
Parole board may frown on that.

06:35.529 --> 06:36.962
Throw that onto their
life sentences.

06:36.964 --> 06:39.164
Cassio Chavez murdered
his own mother

06:39.166 --> 06:41.166
after she flushed
his heroin stash.

06:41.168 --> 06:43.702
And our British spy?
Jacob Scott, former MI6,

06:43.704 --> 06:46.605
caught selling U.S.
nuclear intel to Russia.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.540
Caught by us, NCIS.

06:48.542 --> 06:49.541
He stole Navy info
that we shared

06:49.543 --> 06:51.176
with British allies post 9/11.

06:51.178 --> 06:53.612
Bad time, bad man.

06:53.614 --> 06:55.680
Hey, speaking of, uh, 2001,

06:55.682 --> 06:57.682
I pulled some of the public
real estate records

06:57.684 --> 06:58.884
from northwest DC.

07:00.754 --> 07:04.589
Didn't someone we know buy
an apartment back then?

07:04.591 --> 07:06.691
McGee:
Yes, and in fact

07:06.693 --> 07:08.460
if we adjust for inflation,

07:08.462 --> 07:10.762
Tony still paid
way below market value.

07:10.764 --> 07:11.897
How "way"?

07:13.767 --> 07:16.168
Wow "way."

07:16.170 --> 07:18.069
Explains how you can
afford it, Tony,

07:18.071 --> 07:20.639
but not how you managed it.
Who did you con?

07:20.641 --> 07:23.041
What part of "FBI
case" was unclear?

07:23.043 --> 07:24.643
(Chuckles)

07:24.645 --> 07:25.710
Tony:
It's just for our edification.

07:25.712 --> 07:27.045
You looking for
a fight, DiNozzo?

07:27.047 --> 07:28.613
No, not particularly.
Are you?

07:28.615 --> 07:30.482
A little bit.
Well, you got one.

07:30.484 --> 07:31.716
Director's office, now.

07:31.718 --> 07:33.218
Fornell:
Why involve a third party?

07:33.220 --> 07:34.653
Why don't we settle
this right here?

07:34.655 --> 07:35.654
Bring it on, gramps.

07:35.656 --> 07:36.988
What year were<i> you</i> born?

07:36.990 --> 07:38.657
Gibbs:
Keep working.

07:38.659 --> 07:40.725
¶ ¶

07:43.630 --> 07:45.697
I asked homeland senior division
chief morrow to join us.

07:45.699 --> 07:47.933
Great, another agency.

07:47.935 --> 07:51.736
Vance:
Because, as you may remember,
agent fornell,

07:51.738 --> 07:53.472
chief morrow was formerly
director of NCIS.

07:53.474 --> 07:55.874
Morrow:
When we put Jacob Scott
behind bars.

07:55.876 --> 07:57.742
Something that I'd hoped
would be permanent.

07:57.744 --> 07:59.394
Blame the British.
I do.

07:59.395 --> 08:01.045
It was NCIS intel
that led to Scott.

08:01.048 --> 08:04.049
We handed him over
to them for trial,

08:04.051 --> 08:06.618
as a favor to my British
counterpart.

08:06.620 --> 08:07.986
Saved face.
No.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.154
They missed a leak
in their own house.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.555
Now that he's
on the run again,

08:10.557 --> 08:12.157
it looks twice as bad.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.758
We'll keep the damage minimal.
(Cell phone rings)

08:13.760 --> 08:15.727
Morrow:
No, there's no expiration date
on political capital, Leon.

08:15.729 --> 08:17.729
For both of us.

08:17.731 --> 08:19.764
Excuse me.
Mm-hmm.

08:19.766 --> 08:21.099
Morrow:
This is morrow.

08:21.101 --> 08:23.101
FBI has primary
jurisdiction

08:23.103 --> 08:27.105
for all crimes in which state
borders have been crossed.

08:27.107 --> 08:28.907
Yeah, I'm aware.

08:28.909 --> 08:31.310
Oh, good, because
for a minute there,

08:31.311 --> 08:33.712
I thought we were throwing out
107 years of precedent.

08:34.681 --> 08:38.149
That same precedent also says,

08:38.151 --> 08:40.919
"except cases in which
jurisdiction has been

08:40.921 --> 08:43.755
assigned
to another agency."

08:43.757 --> 08:45.957
And as it turns out, agent
fornell, this one has been.

08:47.928 --> 08:49.928
You already talked
to my boss.
Yes.

08:49.930 --> 08:51.830
NCIS now has the lead.

08:58.672 --> 08:59.738
Hey, Tobias.

08:59.740 --> 09:00.839
Did you know about this?

09:00.841 --> 09:02.741
Eh, cut the act.
What?

09:02.743 --> 09:03.742
Calling us to the crime scene.

09:03.744 --> 09:05.610
"Courtesy" my ass.

09:05.612 --> 09:07.812
You wanted us to fight
for this case.

09:10.751 --> 09:13.218
(Laughs):
Yes. Yes, I did.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.786
Are you kidding me?

09:14.788 --> 09:15.921
International and state borders?

09:15.923 --> 09:18.023
It's a paperwork nightmare.

09:18.025 --> 09:19.057
Why not just ask for help?

09:19.059 --> 09:20.592
Wouldn't look good.

09:20.594 --> 09:22.961
(Laughing): Anyway,
tell me how it turns out.

09:22.963 --> 09:26.031
Agent fornell, you didn't give
me an opportunity to finish.

09:26.033 --> 09:27.299
Your director
and I both agreed

09:27.301 --> 09:28.967
that an FBI presence
is still required,

09:28.969 --> 09:31.570
so you'll be riding shotgun.

09:37.110 --> 09:38.677
Bishop:
<i> I know this is hard for you,</i>

09:38.679 --> 09:40.779
and we'll be in touch.

09:40.781 --> 09:42.113
Thank you.
(Phone beeps off)

09:42.115 --> 09:43.648
Victim's family?

09:43.650 --> 09:47.652
No, our prison guard
has no next of kin.

09:47.654 --> 09:49.221
Her parents are gone,

09:49.222 --> 09:50.789
and her sister died in
a car crash last year.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.657
No one to claim the body.
Not yet.

09:52.659 --> 09:54.125
So who were you consoling
on the phone back there?

09:54.127 --> 09:55.727
Cassio Chavez sr.

09:55.729 --> 09:57.596
The father of our
convicted murderer.

09:57.598 --> 09:58.663
Huh.

09:58.665 --> 10:00.165
Dad blames the drugs

10:00.166 --> 10:01.666
and is worried cassio
will start using again.

10:01.668 --> 10:02.801
Okay, I'm confused.

10:02.803 --> 10:04.135
What exactly
does he want?

10:04.137 --> 10:06.805
He wants us to find
his escaped son

10:06.807 --> 10:08.807
as fast as we can.

10:08.809 --> 10:10.675
Devoted father.

10:10.677 --> 10:13.745
Claims to be, but
i looked him up.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.981
Oh, daddy used
to work at the port.

10:15.983 --> 10:18.917
Felixstowe, where our prisoners
boarded the cargo ship.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.819
Might explain a lot.

10:20.821 --> 10:23.822
Mm-hmm. Getting past security,
getting on the ship.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.824
No easy task.

10:25.826 --> 10:27.359
Unless they have an inside man.
Mm-hmm.

10:27.361 --> 10:29.861
Ducky:
<i> Alcatraz,</i>

10:29.863 --> 10:31.796
leavenworth,
Guantanamo bay.

10:31.798 --> 10:35.367
When it comes to prisons,
famous and infamous,

10:35.369 --> 10:37.902
the United States
has a monopoly.

10:37.904 --> 10:40.405
(Elevator bell dings)
I doubt if anyone
outside the uk,

10:40.407 --> 10:42.641
apart from the tower of London,

10:42.643 --> 10:45.877
(elevator bell dings)
Could name a British
correctional facility.

10:45.879 --> 10:47.145
Brixton.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.313
Wandsworth.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.415
Well, being former inmates

10:50.417 --> 10:52.417
disqualifies you
from answering.

10:52.419 --> 10:54.886
And why did they put you
in different prisons?

10:54.888 --> 10:56.988
You were both arrested
for the same incident.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.923
They drive on the wrong side
of the road.

10:58.925 --> 11:00.291
Nothing makes sense.

11:00.293 --> 11:01.926
You got a cause of death,
duck?

11:01.928 --> 11:04.062
Oh, you've arrived
a little prematurely.

11:04.064 --> 11:06.765
Cause of death has not
yet been determined.

11:06.767 --> 11:09.134
(Faint jazz music plays)

11:09.136 --> 11:10.902
(Phone beeps)

11:15.409 --> 11:16.975
New phone?

11:16.977 --> 11:18.777
I am no longer a luddite.

11:18.779 --> 11:20.245
Since when?
Since now.

11:20.247 --> 11:22.113
I still respect
your beliefs, Gibbs,

11:22.115 --> 11:23.848
but they are no longer my own.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.684
(Faint jazz music plays)

11:25.686 --> 11:28.319
I am trying new things.
(Phone beeps)

11:28.321 --> 11:29.954
With NCIS taking this case,

11:29.956 --> 11:32.123
I was supposed to have time
for that kind of thing.

11:32.125 --> 11:33.692
Ducky:
Jethro,

11:33.694 --> 11:36.394
there is one item
of interest.

11:36.396 --> 11:39.364
These marks.

11:40.801 --> 11:42.967
Needle marks.
Indeed.

11:42.969 --> 11:44.836
There were a high level
of progesterone

11:44.838 --> 11:47.138
in her preliminary blood work.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.406
The hormone?
Yes.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.341
Commonly injected into women

11:50.343 --> 11:51.943
who are trying to get pregnant.

11:51.945 --> 11:54.079
Sadly, this young lady

11:54.081 --> 11:56.281
will never have a family.

12:01.988 --> 12:03.788
McGee:
<i> Unlike cassio,</i>

12:03.790 --> 12:06.791
former MI6 officer Jacob Scott
has no living family.

12:06.793 --> 12:09.260
And anyone connected to him had
basically turned their backs.

12:09.262 --> 12:10.762
Treason will do that.

12:10.764 --> 12:13.098
Apparently no ties to anyone
in england, America.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.734
No friends, no followers,
no minions, nobody.

12:15.736 --> 12:19.270
Come on, even caligula
had a horse.

12:19.272 --> 12:22.340
After murdering most
of his human friends,

12:22.342 --> 12:24.943
the emperor made
his horse a Roman senator.

12:24.945 --> 12:26.144
Easier to trust a horse.

12:26.146 --> 12:28.413
Why are we talking
about horses?

12:28.415 --> 12:31.082
Trying to find out who Jacob
Scott might know in the U.S.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.951
Prison logs--
any visitors?

12:32.953 --> 12:35.920
Uh, his defense team
and reporters mostly.

12:35.922 --> 12:38.089
Last visitor was over
five years ago.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.257
Name is Miranda okafor.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.291
Gibbs:
Background.

12:40.293 --> 12:41.760
(Phone rings)

12:41.762 --> 12:43.128
Yeah, fornell.

12:43.130 --> 12:45.196
This is interesting.
Look at this, boss.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.365
Hmm, a green card.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.968
Miranda okafor
is an immigrant.

12:49.970 --> 12:51.069
From the uk.

12:51.071 --> 12:52.904
Came to America
five years ago.

12:52.906 --> 12:55.173
Now owns a laser tag franchise
in Alexandria.

12:55.175 --> 12:57.475
The lazer zone.

12:57.477 --> 12:59.210
That's exactly right.

12:59.212 --> 13:02.280
Scott's fingerprints have been
found at a second crime scene.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.048
Gibbs:
Let's go--
you're with me, butternut.

13:04.050 --> 13:06.885
I will pull up
driving directions.

13:08.989 --> 13:12.924
(Elevator bell dings)
Did agent fornell
get a new phone?

13:12.926 --> 13:15.794
Robotic voice:
Welcome, future crime fighters!

13:15.796 --> 13:17.295
I hate places like these.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.364
Give me the willies.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.167
Image captured!

13:22.169 --> 13:23.501
(Groans)

13:23.503 --> 13:25.136
Don't forget your I.D. Card!

13:25.138 --> 13:27.205
What the hell was that?

13:28.809 --> 13:31.576
Oh, yeah, that's a good look
for you, Tobias.

13:33.046 --> 13:35.046
You're just jealous.

13:35.047 --> 13:37.047
Please report
to your battle stations!

13:37.050 --> 13:39.884
(Indistinct radio transmission)

13:43.857 --> 13:46.057
Fornell:
No longer just a prison break.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.134
It gets worse.

13:59.973 --> 14:01.940
Fornell:
Mm, it's our British

14:01.942 --> 14:04.142
laser tag owner,
Miranda okafor.

14:04.144 --> 14:06.477
Tag, she's it.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.423
(Rapid beeping)

14:18.425 --> 14:19.624
Here you go, sir.

14:20.894 --> 14:22.861
What's this?

14:22.863 --> 14:25.030
Medical report.

14:25.031 --> 14:27.198
I told you to wait
until the NCIS m.E. Got here!

14:27.200 --> 14:29.868
It's their crime scene.

14:29.870 --> 14:33.104
I don't want to see any files
on my desk this weekend.

14:33.106 --> 14:34.939
Where's the rest
of your team?

14:34.941 --> 14:36.107
You all right, Tobias?

14:36.109 --> 14:38.476
Yeah, I just...

14:38.478 --> 14:40.011
Might have some plans
this weekend.

14:40.013 --> 14:41.279
What kind of plans?

14:41.281 --> 14:43.615
Two gunshots

14:43.617 --> 14:45.516
to both bodies,
all from close range.

14:45.518 --> 14:47.352
Execution.
No murder weapon.

14:47.354 --> 14:49.254
We got two sets of prints

14:49.256 --> 14:52.357
matching those
of our escaped convicts.

14:52.359 --> 14:53.892
Bodies.
The male is

14:53.894 --> 14:55.627
Max allinson--
he's the janitor.

14:55.629 --> 14:57.996
Female is our owner--
Miranda okafor.

14:57.998 --> 14:59.264
No rigor.

14:59.266 --> 15:00.899
Dead less than two hours then.
Yeah.

15:00.901 --> 15:02.634
Jacob Scott has a head start,
but not much.

15:02.636 --> 15:04.002
Why were they here?
Tony:
Got something!

15:04.004 --> 15:05.670
(Beeping)

15:05.672 --> 15:08.072
Course perimeter
is lined with sensors

15:08.074 --> 15:09.641
so if a player steps
out of bounds,

15:09.643 --> 15:10.675
a blast vest sounds an alarm.

15:10.677 --> 15:12.010
(Alarm beeping)

15:12.011 --> 15:13.344
Robotic voice:
Warning, you are out of bounds!

15:13.346 --> 15:14.412
Okay, what's your point?

15:14.414 --> 15:15.914
My point is

15:15.916 --> 15:17.348
why would this fence be
out of bounds?

15:17.350 --> 15:18.950
It's just a fence, right?

15:20.253 --> 15:21.953
No.

15:21.955 --> 15:23.621
Secret door.

15:23.623 --> 15:25.456
And that closet door was open.

15:25.458 --> 15:28.092
Keypad was busted.

15:31.298 --> 15:33.965
Weapons are missing.

15:33.967 --> 15:35.333
Fornell:
Yeah, the real kind.

15:35.335 --> 15:37.602
Explains what our
prisoners wanted here.

15:37.604 --> 15:40.004
Found these in the safe,
but no cash.

15:40.006 --> 15:44.008
Fully armed and funded.

15:44.010 --> 15:47.946
So, who was
Miranda okafor?

15:48.715 --> 15:51.683
Who keeps a spy stash
in a laser tag arena?

15:51.685 --> 15:54.252
Turns out the owner
is former MI6.

15:54.254 --> 15:56.955
"According to British s.I.S.,
Miranda okafor retired

15:56.957 --> 15:59.991
"five years ago,
before she moved to the states

15:59.993 --> 16:01.059
and opened a laser zone."

16:01.061 --> 16:02.694
Provocateur to
entrepreneur.

16:02.696 --> 16:04.362
She trained Jacob Scott.

16:04.364 --> 16:06.431
Yeah, and visited him in prison.

16:07.667 --> 16:10.168
They were friends.
Why kill her?

16:10.170 --> 16:11.669
Maybe she wasn't friend enough
to keep quiet.

16:11.671 --> 16:15.506
So... where did
our jailbirds go?

16:15.508 --> 16:17.375
I don't know, but till
we have a straight answer,

16:17.377 --> 16:19.377
I think it's best we keep
out of Gibbs' eye line.

16:19.379 --> 16:21.379
And put the apartment hunt
on hold?

16:21.381 --> 16:23.247
Yeah.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.418
When this was my office,

16:27.420 --> 16:32.023
I used to offer my guests
a nice single malt.

16:32.025 --> 16:34.058
What the hell is that?

16:34.060 --> 16:36.027
It's more nutritious.

16:36.029 --> 16:37.395
(Scoffs)

16:37.397 --> 16:40.031
What can I do for you, Leon?

16:40.033 --> 16:43.001
If I'm not gonna get that drink,
home is calling.

16:43.003 --> 16:46.204
Jacob Scott hasn't exactly been
keeping a low profile.

16:46.206 --> 16:48.639
Now, the money I understand,

16:48.641 --> 16:50.708
but he could run
without the extra firepower.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.410
Unless he has other plans.

16:52.412 --> 16:54.412
Like trying to get back
into the espionage business?

16:54.414 --> 16:55.346
Why not?

16:55.348 --> 16:58.750
Scott spent 14 years in prison.

16:58.752 --> 17:00.284
He's got nothing to sell.

17:00.286 --> 17:02.020
He got to it once.

17:04.057 --> 17:06.224
NCIS left
no loose ends to pull,

17:06.226 --> 17:07.759
if that's what
you're driving at.

17:07.761 --> 17:11.429
Scott was a Navy intel asset
before there were specops.

17:11.431 --> 17:14.499
At MI6, he functioned at
the highest level of security,

17:14.501 --> 17:16.334
especially
for his age.

17:16.336 --> 17:18.736
Until we got a tip from the CIA.

17:18.738 --> 17:21.639
That he was selling
nuclear intel.

17:21.641 --> 17:23.892
After 9/11,

17:23.893 --> 17:26.144
everyone was very interested
in who had what.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.046
Russia, Iraq, Iran.

17:28.048 --> 17:29.313
Information was valuable.

17:29.315 --> 17:30.448
And once you had Scott,

17:30.450 --> 17:32.150
NCIS went after his buyer,
as well.

17:32.152 --> 17:34.619
Nika razin.

17:34.621 --> 17:36.320
She worked at the Russian
embassy in Turkey.

17:36.322 --> 17:38.790
The raid went pear-shaped
and she was killed.

17:38.792 --> 17:40.658
Not ideal,
but mission accomplished.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.326
Meaning?

17:42.328 --> 17:43.594
Scott had no family,

17:43.596 --> 17:45.596
now, no country,

17:45.598 --> 17:47.331
and with his buyer dead,
no allies.

17:47.333 --> 17:49.200
No loose ends.

17:49.202 --> 17:51.469
And the Russians?

17:51.471 --> 17:52.770
Hell, they denied

17:52.772 --> 17:54.405
all knowledge, of course.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.441
The wounds took years to heal.

17:56.443 --> 17:59.477
That is a scab
not worth scratching, Leon.

17:59.479 --> 18:01.512
Is that an order
or a request, tom?

18:04.317 --> 18:06.250
Advice.

18:06.252 --> 18:08.586
Keep me in the loop.

18:10.790 --> 18:13.091
(Faint jazz music plays)

18:13.093 --> 18:14.459
(Phone beeps)

18:14.461 --> 18:16.561
Okay.
(Laughs)

18:16.563 --> 18:18.629
Who is she?

18:26.539 --> 18:30.374
The phone, the plans.

18:30.376 --> 18:33.144
Are you dating
again, Tobias?

18:33.146 --> 18:35.213
Mm...

18:36.416 --> 18:37.648
Okay.

18:37.650 --> 18:39.350
And if I am?

18:39.352 --> 18:42.186
Just tell me.

18:42.188 --> 18:44.122
Okay, my sex life...

18:44.124 --> 18:45.656
(Laughs)
Oh, god, just...

18:45.658 --> 18:47.391
(Elevator humming)

18:47.393 --> 18:50.161
No.

18:50.163 --> 18:52.630
You asked,
and if you're gonna get

18:52.632 --> 18:55.166
all judgy about it,

18:55.168 --> 18:56.501
you might as well
have the details.

18:56.503 --> 18:57.768
"Judgy"?

18:57.770 --> 19:00.705
I date women on my phone.

19:00.707 --> 19:02.507
Using apps.

19:02.509 --> 19:05.143
They click, I click,

19:05.145 --> 19:07.145
and then if we click...

19:07.147 --> 19:09.213
You get the idea?

19:10.884 --> 19:12.216
(Elevator humming)

19:12.218 --> 19:13.484
Online dating.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.653
Probably your worst nightmare,
isn't it?

19:15.655 --> 19:16.888
No.

19:16.890 --> 19:18.856
No, this conversation is.

19:18.858 --> 19:20.725
(Elevator bell dings,
doors open)
Look, it's been

19:20.727 --> 19:23.394
over a year since Diane died.

19:23.396 --> 19:25.329
This...

19:25.331 --> 19:27.331
(Sighs)

19:27.333 --> 19:28.933
(Elevator bell dings)

19:28.935 --> 19:30.801
Hey, got anything?

19:30.803 --> 19:33.204
A bone to pick with the FBI.

19:33.206 --> 19:34.405
Get in line.

19:34.407 --> 19:36.541
Your examiner still
hasn't released

19:36.543 --> 19:38.276
the bodies from
the laser tag.

19:38.278 --> 19:39.710
Anything else, duck?

19:39.712 --> 19:42.180
Yeah, how about a cause of death

19:42.182 --> 19:43.948
for your British prison guard?

19:43.950 --> 19:45.383
Yeah, perfect.

19:45.385 --> 19:47.752
Sandra billingsley
died of asphyxia.

19:47.754 --> 19:49.253
Strangled?
No.

19:49.255 --> 19:51.072
Suffocated?
No, neither.

19:51.073 --> 19:52.890
That would take just
a matter of seconds.

19:52.892 --> 19:55.226
Not long enough
for her airways

19:55.228 --> 19:58.262
to became inflamed
and swollen

19:58.264 --> 20:01.666
causing her surrounding muscles
to contract,

20:01.668 --> 20:03.568
and her-her
bronchial tubes

20:03.570 --> 20:05.636
(straining):
To narrow.

20:05.638 --> 20:06.604
Asthma attack?

20:06.606 --> 20:08.206
Indeed.

20:08.208 --> 20:10.341
Probably not uncommon
for this woman,

20:10.343 --> 20:12.443
and usually she'd be
able to manage it.

20:12.445 --> 20:13.744
Except she had nowhere to go.

20:13.746 --> 20:15.680
Trapped in a poorly
ventilated box.

20:15.682 --> 20:17.648
And that's probably
what triggered

20:17.650 --> 20:19.350
the attack in the first place.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.919
You know, sea containers
are stacked tightly,

20:21.921 --> 20:23.854
one against the other.

20:23.856 --> 20:27.225
I mean, all she could do
was sit there,

20:27.227 --> 20:28.960
and slowly choke to death.

20:28.962 --> 20:31.462
Could've taken hours or...

20:31.464 --> 20:33.331
Even days.

20:33.333 --> 20:34.999
It's still murder.
Unless...

20:35.001 --> 20:37.602
She was in that container
by choice.

20:37.604 --> 20:39.770
Abby:
<i> Which she was.</i>

20:39.772 --> 20:41.606
Back up.

20:41.607 --> 20:43.441
I processed everything from
inside the shipping container.

20:43.443 --> 20:44.442
Everything?

20:44.444 --> 20:45.443
Yeah, everything.

20:45.445 --> 20:46.911
All two weeks worth.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.412
Luckily, they planned well
enough to bring buckets.

20:48.414 --> 20:49.447
(Groans)

20:49.449 --> 20:50.681
Actually,
they planned too well.

20:50.683 --> 20:51.882
There was enough food,

20:51.884 --> 20:53.751
a duffle bag
full of bottled water,

20:53.753 --> 20:55.419
there were pillows, blankets.

20:55.421 --> 20:56.887
They even brought magazines.

20:56.889 --> 20:58.289
Ooh, I know that.

20:58.291 --> 20:59.690
Last month's issue
of<i> fashion fauxward.</i>

20:59.692 --> 21:02.426
Hilarious.
Tina fey-- so ironic.

21:02.428 --> 21:04.996
My point is, how were they
able to get all this stuff

21:04.998 --> 21:07.431
that quickly after they escaped
and not get caught?

21:07.433 --> 21:08.666
It's like it was...

21:08.668 --> 21:10.301
Pre-packed.
Yeah. Yeah.

21:10.303 --> 21:11.669
All right, check this out.

21:11.671 --> 21:14.305
So the magazine has a torn
address label on it.

21:14.307 --> 21:15.640
Can't really
make it out,

21:15.641 --> 21:16.974
but when you compare
it to what we do know

21:16.976 --> 21:18.809
from Sandra billingsley's
London address...

21:18.811 --> 21:20.511
Tony:
Magazine belonged to her.

21:20.513 --> 21:23.014
Yeah, so either our
prisoners were kind enough

21:23.016 --> 21:25.750
to let their hostage go home
and get some things, or...

21:25.752 --> 21:27.585
So the prison guard
wasn't a hostage.

21:27.587 --> 21:28.986
Yeah, she was
an accomplice.

21:28.988 --> 21:30.421
Time to talk to the brits.

21:30.423 --> 21:31.422
It's 2:00 A.M. in London.

21:31.424 --> 21:32.990
Prisons never close.

21:32.992 --> 21:35.326
(Elevator bell dings)

21:35.328 --> 21:37.028
An accomplice?

21:37.029 --> 21:38.729
I bet the prison warden wasn't
too happy about that one.

21:38.731 --> 21:40.565
Bishop:
Nope.

21:40.566 --> 21:42.400
He insisted on talking to
director Vance tomorrow morning.

21:43.469 --> 21:44.468
Aw, nuts!

21:44.470 --> 21:45.770
What's wrong?

21:45.772 --> 21:49.307
I forgot to ask Tony
to get extra garlic bread.

21:49.309 --> 21:52.710
By the way, great idea, getting
him out of the apartment.

21:52.712 --> 21:54.412
It was your
idea to watch

21:54.414 --> 21:56.714
the lazer zone security footage
back here at his place.

21:56.716 --> 21:57.948
I'm just surprised
he went for it.

21:57.950 --> 21:59.750
Well, I think Tony's
actually enjoying this.

21:59.752 --> 22:01.585
(Phone chimes)
Ooh.

22:01.587 --> 22:03.854
And he will be back any minute.

22:03.856 --> 22:05.556
What'd you find?

22:05.558 --> 22:07.458
The windows are brand-new,
heater's brand-new,

22:07.460 --> 22:09.060
air conditioner: Brand-new.

22:09.062 --> 22:11.696
Which explains the tax credit
for energy efficiency.

22:11.698 --> 22:14.532
Making the utility bills
practically nonexistent.

22:16.569 --> 22:19.737
The more we dig, the more
depressing this is.

22:19.739 --> 22:21.772
Should we stop?

22:21.774 --> 22:23.441
It's like we're
missing something.

22:23.443 --> 22:24.809
(Quietly):
Yeah.

22:24.811 --> 22:27.345
(Gasps): What about
<i>stachybotrys chartarum?</i>

22:27.347 --> 22:29.947
No, I thought of that
and negative.
(Sighs)

22:29.949 --> 22:31.949
It's actually negative
for all types of mold.

22:31.951 --> 22:33.484
Hmm.

22:33.486 --> 22:35.119
Well...

22:35.121 --> 22:36.854
Other than the fact
that this piano

22:36.856 --> 22:38.723
is in front of
the double doors,

22:38.725 --> 22:41.559
there is nothing
wrong with this place.

22:41.561 --> 22:44.362
(Sighs)

22:44.364 --> 22:46.464
What are you doing?
I'm coveting.

22:47.467 --> 22:49.500
Are we missing something?

22:49.502 --> 22:53.104
You think Tony keeps his
real estate statements here?

22:53.106 --> 22:54.839
Wait, are you
talking about

22:54.841 --> 22:56.640
breaking into his
personal files?

22:56.642 --> 22:59.076
It's not like he hasn't
snooped on us.

22:59.078 --> 23:01.011
That's true.
Mm.

23:04.851 --> 23:07.752
Or maybe there's another way.

23:09.422 --> 23:11.021
Maybe...

23:11.023 --> 23:13.557
We call in
reinforcements.

23:13.559 --> 23:14.558
McGee:
I agree.

23:14.560 --> 23:15.760
Look at this.

23:17.797 --> 23:20.398
Bishop:
Our prisoners, walking out
after the murders.

23:20.400 --> 23:21.866
Looks like they're splitting up.

23:21.868 --> 23:23.134
Bishop:
Which means
we are now looking

23:23.136 --> 23:24.902
in two different
directions.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.570
(Sighs)

23:26.572 --> 23:29.140
I really need
that garlic bread.

23:29.142 --> 23:31.442
Where are you,
Jacob Scott?

23:32.912 --> 23:34.979
Cashier:
Hi, welcome
to capitol cruller...

23:36.482 --> 23:38.916
(Phone rings)

23:38.918 --> 23:40.985
Yes, Pamela?

23:40.987 --> 23:43.988
Sir, you have that
9:00 A.M. call in MTAC?

23:43.990 --> 23:45.623
Well, I'm not pulling out now.

23:45.625 --> 23:46.957
I've already ordered.

23:46.959 --> 23:48.959
Uh, so they should
start without you?

23:48.961 --> 23:51.028
I will be there, damn it. I...

23:52.899 --> 23:54.698
Look, I drink that
green stuff every night.

23:54.700 --> 23:56.200
I'm not giving up
my morning donut.

23:56.202 --> 23:58.569
It's the only thing
i have left that has any taste.

23:58.571 --> 23:59.637
Yes, sir.

23:59.639 --> 24:01.572
But you did ask me to...

24:01.574 --> 24:03.574
(Call cuts to static)
To what?

24:03.576 --> 24:05.476
Hello?

24:05.478 --> 24:07.478
Hello?

24:09.782 --> 24:11.916
Nice and easy.

24:11.918 --> 24:14.452
I think you have the wrong car.

24:14.454 --> 24:15.019
Keep it running.

24:15.021 --> 24:16.187
Okay.

24:16.189 --> 24:18.823
Your breakfast tea
will have to wait today.

24:20.760 --> 24:24.495
You're former agent
Jacob Scott.

24:24.497 --> 24:26.230
You followed me from my home.

24:26.232 --> 24:29.500
The Internet's grown so much
since I was away.

24:29.502 --> 24:30.234
And never mind the chat-up...

24:30.236 --> 24:31.936
No one's coming to rescue you.

24:31.938 --> 24:34.638
You can push that panic
button all you like.

24:37.610 --> 24:39.109
You have a cell phone jammer.

24:39.111 --> 24:40.678
You're quick.

24:40.680 --> 24:41.979
That'll help.

24:41.981 --> 24:43.647
Now drive.

24:44.984 --> 24:47.585
Think of your children.

24:57.997 --> 24:59.764
Any luck?

24:59.765 --> 25:01.532
Well... I got a dinner date.

25:01.534 --> 25:02.533
Huh?

25:02.535 --> 25:03.934
Yeah.

25:03.936 --> 25:06.237
Tony's dad made me promise
to have dinner with him

25:06.239 --> 25:08.639
before he told me anything
about Tony's apartment history.

25:08.641 --> 25:10.074
And?

25:10.076 --> 25:14.578
And he has no idea how
he got it so cheap.

25:14.580 --> 25:16.747
Senior played me.
Rude.

25:16.749 --> 25:18.616
Well, I haven't
done much better here.

25:18.618 --> 25:20.184
Beyond public property info,

25:20.186 --> 25:22.186
my Internet search
has been a bust.

25:22.188 --> 25:25.222
Well, Tony was a cop
before NCIS.

25:25.224 --> 25:28.092
(Elevator bell dings)
Maybe he's got
underworld connections?

25:28.094 --> 25:29.760
See, I think he only wants us
to believe that.

25:29.762 --> 25:31.028
Blackmail?

25:31.029 --> 25:32.295
Did he actually
get that lucky?

25:32.298 --> 25:34.098
Neither.
Neither.

25:34.100 --> 25:36.534
Do both of you guys
know the story here?

25:37.670 --> 25:39.036
On the case. Got it.

25:39.038 --> 25:41.605
A British prison break has left

25:41.607 --> 25:44.275
two convicted felons
loose in the greater DC area.

25:44.277 --> 25:46.076
They split up.
And now that he's armed,

25:46.078 --> 25:48.279
Jacob Scott could be looking
to get back into the spy game.

25:48.281 --> 25:49.680
Okay. How?

25:49.682 --> 25:51.982
These are all
very good questions, boss.

25:51.984 --> 25:53.751
I'm not looking for compliments.

25:53.753 --> 25:55.586
Bolo's out, but there's no sign

25:55.588 --> 25:57.054
of Scott or cassio
since yesterday.

25:57.056 --> 25:58.372
Not helping, bishop.

25:58.373 --> 25:59.689
Fornell:
Well, we've got
a prison worker

25:59.692 --> 26:01.592
who has aided in
a prison escape.
How about that?

26:01.594 --> 26:02.760
Yes.

26:02.762 --> 26:04.628
Her majesty's prison service

26:04.630 --> 26:06.697
will be calling soon in MTAC.
Boss...

26:06.699 --> 26:08.699
The director's assistant
said to start without him.

26:08.701 --> 26:10.134
Should've led with that, Chucky.

26:10.136 --> 26:11.135
(Sighs)

26:11.137 --> 26:12.670
I thought that nickname died.

26:12.672 --> 26:15.639
You mean, when my wife did?

26:21.347 --> 26:22.212
Turn ahead.

26:26.619 --> 26:28.419
What do you want?

26:28.420 --> 26:30.220
You killed your only
friend in the world,

26:30.222 --> 26:31.822
Miranda.

26:31.824 --> 26:32.990
What happened?

26:32.992 --> 26:35.059
Keep your hands on the wheel.

26:37.029 --> 26:39.096
Can I help you?

26:44.170 --> 26:45.636
You just did.

26:45.638 --> 26:47.204
All right.

26:47.206 --> 26:48.806
Take it.
Let's be done here.

26:48.808 --> 26:49.807
I still need you.

26:49.809 --> 26:51.208
And I'm not nearly done.

26:54.647 --> 26:57.748
Tony:
So what about on our
laser tag arena owner?

26:57.750 --> 26:59.817
She a British
sleeper spy?
Abby:
No.

26:59.819 --> 27:01.318
I processed
Michelle okafor's

27:01.320 --> 27:03.787
computer,
her cell phone, her office.

27:03.789 --> 27:05.689
She is just totally committed

27:05.691 --> 27:08.025
to e-combat for
children of all ages.

27:08.027 --> 27:10.194
Using her very
particular set of skills.

27:10.196 --> 27:12.663
She came here

27:12.665 --> 27:14.665
to live her American dream.

27:14.667 --> 27:16.367
And enjoy
second amendment rights.

27:16.369 --> 27:18.035
Yeah, but here's the thing:

27:18.037 --> 27:21.338
All of her weapons were
legally purchased and licensed.

27:21.340 --> 27:23.774
And locked in
a hidden wall closet.

27:23.776 --> 27:24.975
In a laser tag arena.

27:24.977 --> 27:27.211
I'm not condoning it.
I'm just saying,

27:27.213 --> 27:31.148
you know, our victim had
no current ties to overseas.

27:31.150 --> 27:33.951
If that's our
laser tag owner,

27:33.953 --> 27:35.986
who's this lady
next to Jacob Scott?

27:35.988 --> 27:39.790
I was told I'd be speaking
with director Vance.

27:39.792 --> 27:43.861
We appreciate you taking
the time, manager grimm.

27:43.863 --> 27:45.329
Naturally, chief morrow.

27:45.331 --> 27:48.232
The name of one of my guards
has been called into question.

27:48.234 --> 27:50.300
It's not a question.
It's fact.

27:50.302 --> 27:51.969
It's a bit premature
to fit the noose.

27:51.971 --> 27:54.371
We're all officers
of the law here.

27:54.373 --> 27:56.106
You can holster
that six-shooter.

27:56.108 --> 27:57.975
He must mean you.

27:57.977 --> 28:00.978
Morrow:
Agent Gibbs may be something
of a cowboy, manager,

28:00.980 --> 28:02.846
but I've worked
with him for a long time.

28:02.848 --> 28:04.882
He doesn't jump to conclusions.

28:04.884 --> 28:07.418
Officer billingsley would never
willingly assist a traitor.

28:07.420 --> 28:08.986
You don't have the full story.

28:08.988 --> 28:11.088
We agree. Right, gentlemen?

28:11.090 --> 28:13.757
We need her personal
and professional records.

28:13.759 --> 28:15.092
Everything you got.

28:15.094 --> 28:17.027
Everything "we got" takes time.

28:17.029 --> 28:19.797
And, how do you say...
"Time is money"?

28:19.799 --> 28:21.865
Then "give it some stick."

28:21.867 --> 28:23.300
Very clever, agent Gibbs.

28:23.302 --> 28:25.302
But taking the Mickey
out of us...

28:25.304 --> 28:26.904
(Static crackling)

28:26.906 --> 28:28.272
System's restarting, sir.

28:28.274 --> 28:30.140
I.P. Protocols
reset whenever

28:30.142 --> 28:31.942
a security breach is
detected on the network.

28:31.944 --> 28:33.210
She's saying
it's a precaution.

28:33.212 --> 28:35.846
No need to worry.
(Faint jazz music plays)

28:35.848 --> 28:38.882
Uh, sir?

28:38.884 --> 28:40.217
Cell phones aren't
permitted in here.

28:48.794 --> 28:51.128
McGee. We've got
a network security alert.

28:51.130 --> 28:52.296
What the hell is it?

28:52.298 --> 28:53.330
It wasn't me!

28:53.332 --> 28:54.331
It was Courtney.

28:54.333 --> 28:56.967
Which one was Courtney?

28:56.969 --> 28:58.902
Oh, yeah... Courtney.

28:58.904 --> 29:00.237
McGee:
System restart was routine.

29:00.239 --> 29:01.989
Internet resets in
the whole building,

29:01.990 --> 29:03.740
but it wasn't triggered by
agent fornell's cell phone.

29:03.743 --> 29:04.575
Told ya.

29:04.576 --> 29:05.408
It was triggered by an alert

29:05.411 --> 29:07.411
at a data center in anacostia.

29:07.413 --> 29:08.879
Gibbs:
Ours.

29:08.881 --> 29:10.047
NCIS accounting
and personnel files,

29:10.049 --> 29:11.915
mostly non-classified data.

29:11.917 --> 29:13.183
But someone accessed our records

29:13.185 --> 29:14.952
using a duress password.

29:14.954 --> 29:16.754
Only used in the event someone's
got a gun to their head.

29:16.756 --> 29:17.755
McGee:
In a manner of speaking.

29:17.757 --> 29:18.822
By who?

29:20.459 --> 29:22.292
Director Vance.

29:29.835 --> 29:31.301
Building security said that

29:31.303 --> 29:34.538
Vance's keycard was used to
enter a private access room.

29:34.540 --> 29:36.406
I think it's this
door down here.

29:42.815 --> 29:44.815
Is this good news
or bad news?

29:44.817 --> 29:46.884
¶ ¶

29:58.864 --> 29:59.963
(beeps, latch clicks)

30:02.401 --> 30:03.834
Leon?

30:03.836 --> 30:05.869
Vance:
In here, Gibbs!

30:05.871 --> 30:07.504
Open the damn door!

30:10.409 --> 30:12.476
(Beeps, latch clicks)

30:13.579 --> 30:16.113
You all right?
Yeah. Scott's gone.

30:16.115 --> 30:18.081
Where?
No idea.
He had me at gunpoint.

30:18.083 --> 30:19.917
He used my keycard
to steal intel.

30:19.919 --> 30:21.952
(Knocking)
McGee, why the hell didn't

30:21.954 --> 30:23.270
my duress password

30:23.271 --> 30:24.587
shut down the system
immediately?

30:24.590 --> 30:26.123
It's a delayed alarm, director.
Why?

30:26.125 --> 30:27.991
If it had shut
down immediately,

30:27.993 --> 30:29.193
he might just
have shot you.

30:32.898 --> 30:34.031
What did he get away with?

30:34.033 --> 30:34.965
A single file.

30:34.967 --> 30:36.466
It's not even
classified.

30:36.468 --> 30:39.036
And it's old.
Really... really old.

30:39.038 --> 30:40.971
This file's got to be worthless.

30:40.973 --> 30:42.272
Not to him.

30:52.384 --> 30:56.086
Bishop:
The stolen case file is a list
of six NCIS operatives

30:56.088 --> 30:58.922
involved in a joint
MI6 operation in 2002.

30:58.924 --> 31:00.557
Just names, no info.

31:00.559 --> 31:02.342
A top sheet.

31:02.343 --> 31:04.126
Practically useless without
the full case file itself.

31:04.129 --> 31:05.462
Murdered two people
to steal it.

31:05.464 --> 31:07.364
Why?

31:07.365 --> 31:09.265
Jacob Scott could have
just as easily disappeared,

31:09.268 --> 31:10.567
raised cats in Connecticut.

31:10.569 --> 31:12.603
Is that a thing?

31:12.605 --> 31:14.438
What was the operation in '02?

31:14.440 --> 31:16.273
Juniper strike.

31:18.210 --> 31:19.443
Vance:
And?

31:19.445 --> 31:21.945
We only know as much
as this top sheet says,

31:21.947 --> 31:23.947
and while the list
wasn't classified,

31:23.949 --> 31:26.250
the operation
it refers to is.

31:26.252 --> 31:28.585
And since it's
a joint operation,

31:28.587 --> 31:30.654
we'll need clearance
from British s.I.S.

31:30.656 --> 31:31.655
Gibbs?

31:31.657 --> 31:33.657
I'd rather not wait, director.

31:33.659 --> 31:35.659
Me neither. Go.

31:38.664 --> 31:41.098
Just to be clear,

31:41.100 --> 31:43.000
you want us to hack into
the case files?

31:44.003 --> 31:46.069
Got it.

31:48.641 --> 31:51.041
(Door closes)

31:51.043 --> 31:52.910
(Whistles)

31:52.912 --> 31:54.111
(Elevator bell dings)

31:55.581 --> 31:56.914
(Elevator bell dings)

31:56.916 --> 31:58.082
(Buzzes)

31:58.083 --> 31:59.249
I figured it out.
(Elevator bell dings)

31:59.251 --> 32:00.250
Where the bad
guys are hiding?

32:00.252 --> 32:01.351
No, your apartment.

32:01.353 --> 32:03.353
The giveaway
was the fact

32:03.355 --> 32:05.022
that Gibbs, fornell
and Abby knew about it,

32:05.024 --> 32:06.356
so I figured it was
case-related.

32:06.358 --> 32:08.191
Good guess,
inspector clouseau.

32:08.193 --> 32:11.528
Not a guess. Your apartment was
the scene of a triple homicide.

32:11.530 --> 32:14.197
Mm, amazing what a
good paint job will do.

32:14.199 --> 32:15.666
Previous owner
hacked up the bodies

32:15.668 --> 32:17.200
with an electric
carving knife.

32:17.202 --> 32:19.536
In your living room.
Mm-hmm.

32:19.538 --> 32:23.273
Yeah, I couldn't get the...
Blood out of the floorboards.

32:23.275 --> 32:25.275
That's why I put the
piano over there.

32:25.277 --> 32:26.276
It was Gibbs' idea.

32:26.278 --> 32:27.661
Out of sight, out of mind.

32:27.662 --> 32:29.045
I guess we have been
to enough crime scenes

32:29.048 --> 32:31.114
to sort of take away
that stigma a little.

32:33.385 --> 32:34.985
Not really.

32:34.987 --> 32:36.586
(Chuckling):
But you saw the price.

32:36.588 --> 32:38.972
You know, the fact that
so much time has passed now,

32:38.973 --> 32:41.357
(elevator bell dings)
You don't even have to disclose
those deaths when you sell.

32:41.360 --> 32:44.161
Wait, is that true?

32:44.163 --> 32:46.163
¶ ¶

32:46.165 --> 32:47.564
Abby?

32:54.039 --> 32:56.673
Ready when you
are, Abbs.

32:56.675 --> 32:59.142
Tony:
Abbs?

32:59.144 --> 33:00.310
I'm ready.
(Tony and McGee gasp)

33:00.312 --> 33:01.678
Whew.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.647
Did you think
i was in the coffin?
Uh...

33:03.649 --> 33:04.648
If the shoe fits.

33:04.650 --> 33:06.116
It didn't.
I tried.

33:06.118 --> 33:08.986
Plus the lining
is non-biodegradable,

33:08.988 --> 33:11.121
and the velvet thread count
is criminal.

33:11.123 --> 33:13.156
I wouldn't be caught dead
in that thing.

33:13.158 --> 33:14.992
Did you call us down here
to talk about coffin comfort?

33:14.994 --> 33:16.693
No, financial records

33:16.695 --> 33:18.362
for Sandra billingsley.

33:18.364 --> 33:19.463
McGee:
Dead prison guard accomplice.

33:19.465 --> 33:20.814
Abby:
Yep.

33:20.815 --> 33:22.164
So a month ago,
she put down a deposit

33:22.167 --> 33:24.067
at a company in Delaware.

33:24.069 --> 33:26.069
Ooh, fertility
clinic.

33:26.071 --> 33:28.205
She was planning to get
pregnant here in the U.S.

33:28.207 --> 33:29.539
Abby:
That's not the interesting part.

33:29.541 --> 33:31.074
When she put down the deposit,

33:31.076 --> 33:32.776
she was required
to give a local address.

33:32.778 --> 33:34.044
Apartment
in Dover.

33:34.046 --> 33:35.045
In her name?

33:35.047 --> 33:36.046
No.

33:36.048 --> 33:37.547
Lila mcclane.

33:37.549 --> 33:39.082
I did a background
check on that,

33:39.084 --> 33:41.084
and it ended up
being a dead end.

33:41.086 --> 33:42.219
Alias.

33:42.221 --> 33:45.088
Yeah, but if she planned
this whole thing

33:45.090 --> 33:46.223
with Jacob Scott, then...

33:46.225 --> 33:47.791
Tony:
He knows about this place.

33:47.793 --> 33:49.126
Could be where
he's hiding.

33:49.128 --> 33:50.660
Thank you.

33:50.662 --> 33:52.662
Get him.

33:54.299 --> 33:56.633
No one's home,
but the curtains were open.

33:56.635 --> 33:58.402
Someone is definitely
living there.

33:58.404 --> 33:59.336
Team's in place?

33:59.338 --> 34:01.038
Ready for my signal.

34:01.774 --> 34:03.640
Sorry.

34:03.642 --> 34:05.442
I got tired of riding shotgun.

34:05.444 --> 34:06.777
Will you make up your damn mind?

34:06.779 --> 34:08.178
(Faint jazz music plays)
Are you in or are you out?

34:08.180 --> 34:09.479
(Phone beeps)

34:09.481 --> 34:11.048
Oh, who's that now?

34:11.050 --> 34:12.749
Gibbs:
Courtney?

34:12.751 --> 34:14.451
No, it's Rita.

34:14.453 --> 34:16.653
How many you got?

34:16.655 --> 34:17.687
None.

34:17.689 --> 34:19.189
Doesn't sound like it.

34:19.191 --> 34:20.424
Well, I can't get it up.

34:20.426 --> 34:22.125
Ah, geez.
No, the nerve.

34:22.127 --> 34:23.794
I can't get up the nerve
to go out with them.

34:23.796 --> 34:25.328
I should start this all again.

34:25.330 --> 34:26.797
Please, don't.

34:26.799 --> 34:29.766
I text these women
through the apps.

34:29.768 --> 34:34.371
They sound wonderful,
but... I always seem

34:34.373 --> 34:37.074
to come up with excuses
not to met.

34:37.076 --> 34:38.675
You nervous?
No!

34:38.677 --> 34:39.810
Got plenty of game.

34:39.812 --> 34:41.678
It's just...

34:41.680 --> 34:43.180
(Sighs)

34:43.182 --> 34:44.514
Is it too soon?

34:44.516 --> 34:46.083
(Groans, chuckles)

34:46.085 --> 34:48.085
You were married to her.

34:48.087 --> 34:50.087
I was twice.
Tobias...

34:50.089 --> 34:51.688
I want to date.

34:51.690 --> 34:54.691
Well, uh, you know what,
then date.

34:54.693 --> 34:55.826
Just-just do it.

34:55.828 --> 34:57.194
You don't need my blessing.

34:57.196 --> 34:58.829
I'm not asking
for your blessing.

35:00.132 --> 35:02.766
But if you were gonna give it...

35:02.768 --> 35:04.501
I'll text her back.

35:06.405 --> 35:07.737
(Phone beeping)

35:07.739 --> 35:09.873
Well, hold off, lover boy.

35:09.875 --> 35:11.541
Cassio Chavez.

35:11.543 --> 35:13.210
Not the criminal
we were expecting.

35:13.212 --> 35:14.878
Well, second best is
gonna have to do.

35:14.880 --> 35:16.580
I owe you one.
Yeah, you're damn
right you do.

35:16.582 --> 35:19.249
Go, go, go, go.

35:19.251 --> 35:21.418
Gibbs, now you got
to do the paperwork.

35:21.420 --> 35:22.586
(Laughs)

35:22.588 --> 35:25.188
Agent:
Get down on the ground, now!

35:26.158 --> 35:29.192
(Agents talking indistinctly)

35:30.596 --> 35:34.197
Fornell: Prison records show you
went through their drug program.

35:36.468 --> 35:38.135
Fall off the wagon?

35:38.137 --> 35:39.469
Stress can do that.

35:39.471 --> 35:41.471
Double murder.

35:41.473 --> 35:43.473
Prison break.
Yeah.

35:43.475 --> 35:44.808
It's a lot to juggle.

35:44.810 --> 35:46.877
I go half-crazy choosing
neckties in the morning.

35:46.879 --> 35:49.212
Yeah, well, he's already
got a life sentence.

35:49.214 --> 35:51.348
Fornell:
Right, no consequences.

35:51.350 --> 35:53.183
None of this bothers him.

35:59.858 --> 36:03.593
Unless...

36:03.595 --> 36:05.595
The baby and the apartment...

36:05.597 --> 36:07.464
Were all for you.

36:08.767 --> 36:12.435
Sandra was the love of my life.

36:12.437 --> 36:14.237
She was there for me.

36:14.239 --> 36:17.908
Through rehab, my darkest times.

36:17.910 --> 36:20.343
And during hers,

36:20.345 --> 36:24.681
all I could do was sit
and watch her die.

36:24.683 --> 36:26.883
F-for two days.

36:26.885 --> 36:28.251
In the sea container.

36:28.253 --> 36:31.254
Two days...

36:31.256 --> 36:33.957
Before I could lay her to rest
in that casket.

36:33.959 --> 36:38.495
It's the only thing I've done
right since she's passed.

36:38.497 --> 36:40.730
Because you started using again.

36:42.367 --> 36:44.201
Do you think
they'll let me bury her?

36:44.203 --> 36:46.203
With special privileges...

36:46.205 --> 36:48.205
It's not likely.

36:48.207 --> 36:52.209
Unless... you tell us
what happened.

36:52.945 --> 36:55.779
I didn't mean to kill
those people.

36:55.781 --> 36:57.614
It was you?
It was the drugs.

36:57.616 --> 37:00.951
That woman, she gave us each,
you know, a little money

37:00.953 --> 37:04.955
and-and said she was willing
to look the other way

37:04.957 --> 37:07.290
as long as we never
came back again.

37:07.292 --> 37:09.626
You did.

37:09.628 --> 37:12.362
Yeah, well, she had so much
more, you know, in the closet,

37:12.364 --> 37:17.000
so... so I got high and, uh, and
then I come back for the rest.

37:20.973 --> 37:23.306
The prison escape.

37:24.743 --> 37:27.277
It was a year of planning.

37:27.279 --> 37:28.411
Between us.

37:28.413 --> 37:29.412
You and Scott.

37:29.414 --> 37:30.981
No, Sandra.

37:30.983 --> 37:32.515
Scott wasn't part
of the plan.

37:32.517 --> 37:34.951
He was just assigned with me
on kitchen duty.

37:34.953 --> 37:38.255
He requested
that assignment.

37:38.257 --> 37:39.889
So what?

37:39.891 --> 37:41.925
How'd you meet Sandra?

37:44.296 --> 37:47.297
Well... Scott introduced us.

37:47.299 --> 37:48.732
Oh, man.

37:48.734 --> 37:51.434
Yeah, well, that was,
like, two years ago.

37:51.436 --> 37:52.936
He's been playing you.

37:52.938 --> 37:54.938
Two years?

37:54.940 --> 37:57.407
Man really wants to get
back into the spy game.

37:57.976 --> 38:00.010
Spy game? No.

38:00.012 --> 38:01.611
No, mate.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.647
Jacob Scott's out for blood.

38:03.649 --> 38:04.814
Yeah? Whose?

38:04.816 --> 38:06.983
Yours.

38:08.587 --> 38:11.821
He said NCIS killed his wife.

38:13.925 --> 38:16.326
No record of Scott
ever being married.

38:20.365 --> 38:22.032
Bishop:
This doesn't make any sense.

38:22.034 --> 38:23.700
You got into the case file?

38:23.702 --> 38:25.368
Enough of it, anyway.

38:25.370 --> 38:27.370
So what was Juniper strike?

38:27.372 --> 38:29.706
2002 raid
in Istanbul, Turkey,

38:29.708 --> 38:31.374
to take down Scott's
Russian buyer.

38:31.376 --> 38:32.709
We already knew
about this.

38:32.711 --> 38:33.710
Exactly.

38:33.712 --> 38:34.844
Buyer was killed.

38:34.846 --> 38:36.546
Bishop:
Russian national nika razin.

38:36.548 --> 38:37.881
Tony:
Hey.

38:37.883 --> 38:39.549
I've seen her before.

38:39.551 --> 38:41.685
In a photo from
the laser tag office.

38:41.687 --> 38:45.088
McGee: She's dead; Why does
Scott still care about her?

38:45.090 --> 38:46.756
She was his wife.

38:46.758 --> 38:48.758
He was selling
secrets to his wife?

38:48.760 --> 38:50.393
Talk about
<i> the spy who loved me.</i>

38:50.395 --> 38:51.528
The stolen file, put it up.

38:51.530 --> 38:53.146
Bishop:
Top sheet was a list

38:53.147 --> 38:54.763
of people involved
in the operation.

38:54.766 --> 38:56.766
Aka his wife's death.

38:56.768 --> 38:58.468
Boss, this is
a hit list?

38:58.470 --> 39:00.337
Where would he
start, Gibbs?
The top.

39:00.339 --> 39:02.639
The man who ordered
the whole damn thing.

39:02.641 --> 39:04.808
¶ ¶

39:13.018 --> 39:16.119
(tires screeching)

39:16.121 --> 39:18.054
(Dog barking in distance)

39:18.056 --> 39:20.123
Gibbs:
Cover the back.

39:25.130 --> 39:27.597
(Knocking loudly)
NCIS!

39:28.467 --> 39:29.899
We too late?

39:29.901 --> 39:31.601
Okay, let's do this.

39:31.603 --> 39:33.937
(Gasps)

39:36.408 --> 39:37.741
Gibbs:
Hi.

39:37.743 --> 39:40.076
NCIS.

39:40.078 --> 39:41.144
Pottery club ended an hour ago.

39:41.146 --> 39:42.462
Agent Gibbs,

39:42.463 --> 39:43.779
is that why my phone's
been ringing?

39:43.782 --> 39:45.782
Yes, it is.

39:45.784 --> 39:47.484
Is your husband home?

39:47.486 --> 39:49.486
Yeah, he's in the den,
working on his book.

39:49.488 --> 39:52.088
I'm guessing you're not here
to help proofread.

39:52.090 --> 39:53.156
No, we're not.
(Chuckling):
All right.

39:53.158 --> 39:54.691
Wipe your feet.

39:54.693 --> 39:56.426
Double doors,
right over there.

39:57.562 --> 40:00.096
(Classical music playing)

40:00.098 --> 40:01.631
Nice place.

40:01.633 --> 40:03.700
What do you think
he pulls in at homeland?

40:13.445 --> 40:15.512
He give us the slip?

40:23.188 --> 40:25.455
No.

40:35.100 --> 40:37.100
Mrs. morrow:
Can I get you guys anything?

40:37.102 --> 40:39.569
Something to drink?
