00:14.439 --> 00:17.719
Gas board, miss. The meter's
at the top of the stairs.

01:47.879 --> 01:51.319
'The Pope's coronation gift
to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth

01:51.359 --> 01:55.239
'has left Vatican City on the first
leg of its journey to London.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.959
'The Pelagius Cross,
a magnificent necklace

01:57.960 --> 02:00.079
'comprised of emeralds and rubies,

02:00.120 --> 02:02.519
'is said to be beyond price.

02:02.560 --> 02:06.319
'It will be accompanied to London
by representatives of His Holiness

02:06.359 --> 02:08.800
'and a cohort of Swiss Guards.

02:08.840 --> 02:13.759
'The Papal prelates will visit the
Roman Catholic Dioceses of Liverpool

02:13.759 --> 02:17.318
'and Gloucester before arriving
in London, where the gift will be

02:17.319 --> 02:21.000
'presented to Her Majesty at a state
banquet at Buckingham Palace.'

02:35.520 --> 02:38.719
In nomine patris et filii
et spiritus sancti, amen.

03:04.599 --> 03:07.919
Ah! Father, how very propitious.
We were just on our way to find you.

03:07.919 --> 03:10.319
You've seen the news, then.
Such an honour.

03:10.360 --> 03:12.360
Not that the likes of us
will get a glimpse.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.000
That is where you are wrong, Mrs M.

03:14.039 --> 03:16.959
I thought you should see this.

03:16.960 --> 03:20.318
It's all very last-minute and
hush-hush, what with high security.

03:20.319 --> 03:23.120
"Bishop Reynard requests
the pleasure of your company

03:23.159 --> 03:26.680
"at a reception
to present the Pelagius Cross."

03:26.719 --> 03:28.039
Idiot!

03:29.520 --> 03:30.840
Not you, Mrs McCarthy.

03:32.120 --> 03:35.000
He makes Bishop Talbot...
God rest his soul.

03:36.199 --> 03:39.360
..look like Solomon. Are you thinking
what we're thinking?

03:39.400 --> 03:41.319
Opportunity makes a thief.

03:47.159 --> 03:48.558
Sheffield steel,

03:48.560 --> 03:51.799
capable of withstanding
five pounds of explosives.

03:51.800 --> 03:55.199
You could dynamite the building
and it would be left standing.

03:55.240 --> 03:57.679
That is of huge consolation.

03:57.680 --> 04:01.520
I'm stationing four men inside the
room and two more outside the door.

04:01.560 --> 04:03.960
No entry or exit from the window.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.400
A sheer drop of 50 feet
to the ground

04:06.439 --> 04:08.400
with a reassuring lack of footholds.

04:11.120 --> 04:12.840
Good afternoon, Bishop Reynard.

04:12.879 --> 04:14.000
Father Brown.

04:15.400 --> 04:16.918
Which one?

04:16.920 --> 04:18.279
My Lord?

04:18.319 --> 04:21.000
I have two incumbents name of Brown.

04:21.040 --> 04:25.519
Parish of Little Haydock, "competent
but uninspired", and Kembleford,

04:25.519 --> 04:27.678
"total ruddy liability."

04:27.680 --> 04:29.358
Which, I wonder, are you?

04:29.360 --> 04:31.838
Take a wild guess.
What do you want, Padre?

04:31.839 --> 04:35.358
I believe you're holding
a reception for the Pelagius Cross.

04:35.360 --> 04:37.278
If you're angling for an invitation

04:37.279 --> 04:39.319
I regret
your presence isn't requisite.

04:39.360 --> 04:42.159
It's not my presence
you should be worried about.

04:42.199 --> 04:44.959
Are you familiar with
the name of Hercule Flambeau?

04:44.959 --> 04:46.399
Who isn't?

04:46.439 --> 04:49.439
But what makes you think
he'll turn up in Gloucester?

04:49.480 --> 04:51.319
Call it an educated guess.

04:51.319 --> 04:52.680
I know what I'd call it.

04:54.279 --> 04:59.120
It's exactly the prize he would covet
and the opportunity he needs.

04:59.159 --> 05:02.678
He'd have to blow the safe
without razing the building

05:02.680 --> 05:04.279
and escape on wings.

05:05.720 --> 05:10.160
Until the jewel is removed from the
safe for display to all and sundry.

05:10.199 --> 05:13.600
To a select group
of highly vetted guests.

05:13.639 --> 05:16.238
Where it will be
surrounded by my men.

05:16.240 --> 05:19.079
If Frenchie's moronic enough
to turn up, we'll nab him.

05:19.120 --> 05:20.519
He's a master of disguise.

05:20.560 --> 05:23.000
I assume there's a point
to all this.

05:23.040 --> 05:26.040
I'm one of the few people
that can identify him.

05:27.480 --> 05:29.560
Let me be your eyes and ears,
my Lord.

05:29.600 --> 05:31.040
You can see yourself out.

05:33.279 --> 05:36.159
I answer to a higher authority
than you, Inspector.

05:38.040 --> 05:39.360
Indeed he does.

05:40.879 --> 05:44.519
Very well, Father.
You've a file thicker than my arm

05:44.560 --> 05:47.802
but unlike my predecessor,
I believe in keeping the

05:47.834 --> 05:50.980
more intransigent elements
where I can see them.

05:51.026 --> 05:53.040
On your own head.

05:53.079 --> 05:55.000
But for the record,

05:55.040 --> 05:59.120
one of the cardinals is tipped
to be the next Secretary of State.

05:59.159 --> 06:03.360
Embarrass me and the torments of Job
will be like the mildest of rebukes.

06:11.680 --> 06:14.759
Whoever described England
as green and pleasant

06:14.800 --> 06:17.439
had never laid eyes on Liverpool.

06:17.439 --> 06:19.040
Or eaten its food.

06:22.959 --> 06:24.680
What news from Rome?

06:24.720 --> 06:27.000
Is there any word
on Cardinal Brunocelli?

06:28.800 --> 06:31.598
There is no change in his condition.

06:31.600 --> 06:34.639
He has remarkable stamina
for a man of 98.

06:36.519 --> 06:39.959
Any rumours as to his successor?

06:40.000 --> 06:44.319
His Eminence has decided to wait
until his body is cold

06:44.319 --> 06:47.680
before announcing his replacement.

06:47.720 --> 06:50.360
Allora, let us pray for him.

07:08.639 --> 07:10.199
This is becoming tedious.

07:10.240 --> 07:13.879
Humble acts of genuflexion -
they always appear so conceited.

07:13.920 --> 07:16.720
Deference is a virtue
that has sadly passed you by.

07:18.160 --> 07:20.560
I hear you're playing guard dog
at the reception.

07:20.600 --> 07:24.959
Isn't that what you want? You're
in danger of becoming predictable.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.680
Never second-guess a thief.

07:26.720 --> 07:29.079
It limits your chances
of catching them.

07:29.079 --> 07:32.560
You want to steal the Pelagius Cross
and I want to stop you.

07:34.240 --> 07:36.399
The rules have changed.

07:36.439 --> 07:38.079
This time I need your help.

07:39.279 --> 07:41.038
Her name is Marianne Delacroix.

07:41.040 --> 07:44.319
She was kidnapped two days ago
from her lodgings at Oxford.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.560
My name is Nero Hound.

07:48.840 --> 07:51.639
Please don't scream.
There's no-one to hear you.

07:51.680 --> 07:55.959
You've made a mistake.
I've no family to pay you ransom.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.718
I don't make mistakes,
Miss Marianne Delacroix.

07:59.720 --> 08:02.238
Born 2nd June 1931.

08:02.240 --> 08:06.038
Educated at Cheltenham Ladies
College and the Sorbonne.

08:06.040 --> 08:10.839
Now taking your PhD in Fine Art
at St Hilda's College, Oxford,

08:10.879 --> 08:15.278
where you have many acquaintances
but no real friends

08:15.279 --> 08:19.480
and live alone
with your cat, Autolycus.

08:19.519 --> 08:21.920
Do you know
who Autolycus was, Terry?

08:23.600 --> 08:25.399
He was the son of the god Hermes,

08:25.439 --> 08:28.839
inheriting his father's skills
for theft and trickery

08:28.879 --> 08:32.480
and bequeathed the gift that
his thieving could never be caught.

08:35.360 --> 08:39.000
An unusual name for a pet,
Miss Delacroix?

08:40.600 --> 08:41.799
What do you want?

08:43.679 --> 08:46.320
Please, no...

08:46.360 --> 08:50.759
Oh, rest assured,
I prefer my women... willing.

08:52.320 --> 08:57.039
And I desire something
far more precious than your virtue.

09:03.399 --> 09:04.960
I received this.

09:06.440 --> 09:07.759
A ransom note?

09:07.759 --> 09:09.480
Crude but efficacious.

09:09.519 --> 09:12.360
The sender was good enough
to leave his signature.

09:13.600 --> 09:14.919
A dog.

09:14.960 --> 09:18.198
A black dog. The mark of Nero Hound.

09:18.200 --> 09:22.158
A miscreant mongrel
with dangerous aspirations.

09:22.159 --> 09:23.960
Friend of yours?

09:24.000 --> 09:25.480
An old score to settle.

09:26.960 --> 09:29.159
He'd cut her throat in a heartbeat.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.240
She's very beautiful.

09:37.240 --> 09:39.679
Although,
if you don't mind my saying...

09:41.559 --> 09:44.399
..she's rather young for you,
isn't she?

09:44.440 --> 09:45.639
She's my daughter.

09:49.799 --> 09:51.039
You know my father?

09:52.960 --> 09:55.159
Better than most.

09:55.200 --> 09:58.239
Then you have me
at another disadvantage.

09:58.240 --> 10:01.440
I know he's the only man
that can steal the Pelagius Cross

10:01.480 --> 10:03.320
from a cohort of Swiss Guards.

10:05.200 --> 10:07.759
My father abandoned me
before I was born.

10:07.799 --> 10:11.200
He abandoned me
to a Colombian firing squad.

10:11.240 --> 10:13.639
So we have something in common.

10:16.840 --> 10:19.559
And if he doesn't bring you
this jewel?

10:19.600 --> 10:23.000
Be assured, I'll take
no pleasure in killing you.

10:24.759 --> 10:26.678
I've never met the man.

10:26.679 --> 10:30.120
What makes you think
he cares if I live or die?

10:30.159 --> 10:32.558
Pride.

10:32.559 --> 10:34.639
He has until 7pm on Monday.

10:38.639 --> 10:43.759
Her mother? A ballerina
in the corps at the Paris Opera.

10:43.759 --> 10:48.399
A brief pas de deux.
Strangers passing in the night.

10:48.399 --> 10:50.879
A stranger who bore you a child.

10:50.919 --> 10:52.879
I thought you'd approve.

10:52.879 --> 10:54.279
What?

10:54.320 --> 10:57.480
I spared her my corrupting presence
and honoured my obligations.

10:57.519 --> 10:59.360
Denied her father's love.

10:59.399 --> 11:02.080
You of all people
should know how that feels.

11:02.120 --> 11:06.279
She received every advantage.
The finest education money can buy.

11:06.320 --> 11:07.679
And in return?

11:09.519 --> 11:13.159
I received a photograph
once a year from her mother.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.600
Look, you've reason enough
not to trust me.

11:18.200 --> 11:20.080
The truth is in her eyes.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.320
I believe she's your daughter.

11:24.960 --> 11:27.519
And you have surprised me.

11:30.039 --> 11:31.519
What do you want?

11:32.759 --> 11:35.318
I want you to practise
what you preach.

11:35.320 --> 11:38.918
Excluding the eighth commandment,
presumably. But not the tenth.

11:38.919 --> 11:42.359
Greed is a sin
and your church is rotten with it.

11:42.360 --> 11:46.959
The Pope is St Peter's successor.
Theft from him is theft from God.

11:46.960 --> 11:49.558
A God who favours the poor
over the rich.

11:49.559 --> 11:51.639
You could say
I was doing him a favour.

11:53.200 --> 11:54.399
And my soul?

11:55.919 --> 11:58.480
You preach that
possessions are worthless.

11:58.519 --> 12:01.318
Only God and men have eternal value.

12:01.320 --> 12:03.960
You would blackmail me
with my own morality?

12:04.000 --> 12:06.159
Oh, I'll do whatever it takes.

12:06.200 --> 12:09.840
And you would rather a theft
on your conscience than a life.

12:09.879 --> 12:11.840
I believe you want to save her.

12:13.519 --> 12:17.679
Perhaps, after all, there is
some hope for your redemption.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.799
Run that by me again.

12:22.840 --> 12:27.879
Flambeau wants you to help him
steal the Pope's coronation gift

12:27.919 --> 12:29.759
to the Queen of England.

12:32.720 --> 12:36.440
Well, he wants me to look
the other way while he steals it.

12:36.480 --> 12:38.159
And what's the difference?

12:38.200 --> 12:41.720
Well, I'm hoping
God will make the distinction.

12:41.759 --> 12:44.960
And you would see
through his disguise.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.240
He's not involving her as well.

12:47.279 --> 12:49.318
I can speak for myself,
thank you, Sidney.

12:49.320 --> 12:52.678
And you believe
this cock and bull story of his?

12:52.679 --> 12:54.558
I believe that she's his daughter.

12:54.559 --> 12:57.599
Father Brown's right.
The resemblance is startling.

12:57.600 --> 13:00.438
So what if she is?
They're probably in it together.

13:00.440 --> 13:03.039
I don't think so. Look at her eyes.

13:03.080 --> 13:06.320
Ah. You've noticed that as well?

13:06.360 --> 13:09.559
If this were a ploy
she'd be trying to look scared.

13:09.600 --> 13:11.600
But that's not fear. It's defiance.

13:12.639 --> 13:16.078
This is the Pope's gift to
Her Majesty we're talking about.

13:16.080 --> 13:19.679
In my experience, Mrs McCarthy,
jewels are vastly overrated.

13:42.559 --> 13:45.120
Welcome, Your Eminence.

13:45.159 --> 13:47.999
Inspector Mallory
from the Kembleford Constabulary,

13:48.000 --> 13:50.799
may I present Cardinal Bonipogio...

13:50.840 --> 13:52.798
Head of Protocol.

13:52.799 --> 13:55.080
..and Cardinal Papillon.

13:55.120 --> 13:57.318
Chief of Security.

13:57.320 --> 14:00.840
I think you'll find my arrangements
more than satisfactory.

14:02.200 --> 14:03.399
May I?

14:03.399 --> 14:06.678
Certo, certo! Bene, bene!

14:06.679 --> 14:07.840
Scusi, scusi.

14:22.600 --> 14:25.519
Oh. Magnificent.

14:25.559 --> 14:28.239
Her Majesty is indeed fortunate.

14:28.240 --> 14:30.679
Si. Si.

14:33.080 --> 14:34.200
Excellent.

14:36.759 --> 14:37.959
Bon.

14:44.360 --> 14:46.479
Who else has the combination?

14:46.480 --> 14:49.080
Only the Inspector and myself.

14:49.120 --> 14:53.159
And I will require it
in case of emergencies.

14:55.320 --> 14:59.840
In the meantime, four of my men
will stand 24-hour guard.

14:59.879 --> 15:02.879
The jewel has its own guard.

15:05.960 --> 15:09.119
With respect, Your Honour...

15:09.120 --> 15:10.840
how do I know I can trust 'em?

15:12.360 --> 15:16.039
No more than I know
if I can trust yours.

15:17.360 --> 15:20.999
We have a saying here in England -
"The more the merrier."

15:21.000 --> 15:25.279
And another one.
"Too many cooks spoil the broth."

15:30.039 --> 15:31.960
I asked for your help,
not your army.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.798
Well, someone has to make sure
you don't double-cross him.

15:34.799 --> 15:37.039
Countess. As fragrant as ever.

15:37.080 --> 15:39.879
You can save your Gallic charm
for whoever gets to judge you.

15:39.919 --> 15:42.600
Tea's in the pot.
You can help yourself.

15:42.639 --> 15:45.159
I take it
you encountered some resistance.

15:45.200 --> 15:47.200
Asking the Father
to help you thieve!

15:47.240 --> 15:49.838
He can cleanse himself
in the confessional.

15:49.840 --> 15:51.078
I look forward to that.

15:51.080 --> 15:54.519
I suppose you've got some sort
of ingenious plan. Naturally.

15:56.159 --> 15:57.559
Bishop Colum Cormac.

16:00.639 --> 16:02.839
Suitable in terms of height
if not build.

16:02.840 --> 16:05.038
Travelling from Donegal
for the reception,

16:05.039 --> 16:07.320
where he will unfortunately
be delayed en route.

16:07.360 --> 16:10.519
Holy Mother.
Now he's going to kidnap a bishop.

16:10.559 --> 16:14.399
With Cormac safely indisposed,
I will step in and take his place.

16:21.559 --> 16:24.519
'Once inside,
it's a simple Panama switch.'

16:25.600 --> 16:26.799
Magnificent.

16:33.720 --> 16:35.519
'Simple and ingenious.'

16:35.559 --> 16:39.159
And impossible. It would take
a master forger months if not years

16:39.200 --> 16:41.639
to make a forgery
that would pass muster.

16:41.639 --> 16:44.679
Plan B, however,
is hastily improvised

16:44.720 --> 16:46.279
and shameful in its crudity.

16:56.080 --> 16:57.120
Magnificent.

17:01.240 --> 17:04.358
Nobody move or the priest gets it.

17:04.400 --> 17:05.598
Ha!

17:15.759 --> 17:17.637
That's your master plan?

17:17.640 --> 17:20.000
That is the worst idea
I have ever heard.

17:20.039 --> 17:23.038
If I had time to be inventive,
do you think I'd require assistance?

17:23.039 --> 17:26.920
Taking Father Brown hostage won't
hold much sway with the Inspector.

17:26.960 --> 17:29.759
He'd probably give the order
to shoot through you.

17:29.799 --> 17:31.999
He's right. He would.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.839
It's the best I have.
And at worst, I tried.

17:34.880 --> 17:36.599
You'll have to use me instead.

17:37.839 --> 17:41.558
All hell would break loose if
you shot the Countess of Montague.

17:41.559 --> 17:43.839
I have no cause to
deserve your help.

17:43.880 --> 17:45.799
I'm not doing it for you, Monsieur.

18:20.480 --> 18:21.720
Thank you.

18:24.079 --> 18:26.878
Were you aware
my predecessor nicknamed you

18:26.880 --> 18:29.279
"The Eleventh Plague of Egypt"?

18:29.319 --> 18:31.398
Bishop Talbot's wit was legendary.

18:31.400 --> 18:34.119
I share his sense of humour,
but not his tolerance.

18:34.160 --> 18:36.599
So if I can prevail on you
to behave yourself...

18:36.640 --> 18:40.440
Ah, Your Eminences.
This is Father Brown.

18:40.480 --> 18:43.920
Father Brown?
He is not on the guest list.

18:43.960 --> 18:46.638
No. He is, er... Internal security.

18:46.640 --> 18:49.400
Cardinals Bonipogio and Papillon.

18:51.039 --> 18:52.440
Cardinal Bonipogio.

18:53.960 --> 18:55.279
Cardinal Papillon.

18:57.720 --> 19:01.440
Are you related to
Procurator Papillon?

19:01.480 --> 19:03.200
An uncle.

19:03.240 --> 19:06.719
My family has been breeding
papal courtiers for centuries.

19:06.720 --> 19:11.000
There have been Papillons
in the Vatican since 1790.

19:13.000 --> 19:19.278
My colleague, on the other hand,
as the son of a circus performer,

19:19.279 --> 19:23.799
demonstrates just how modern-day
the Curia has become.

19:23.839 --> 19:27.160
My father was an artiste.

19:27.200 --> 19:30.878
He was feted by
the kings and queens of Europa.

19:30.880 --> 19:34.480
Cesare Bonipogio, the Great Marvel?

19:34.519 --> 19:38.559
Si, you are clearly
more educated than some, Father.

19:38.599 --> 19:41.200
It is said
he could turn water into wine.

19:41.240 --> 19:44.240
And then into brandy
and back into water again!

19:46.720 --> 19:48.279
Crude trickery!

19:48.319 --> 19:51.319
The last of the guests have arrived.
Shall we go inside?

20:26.319 --> 20:28.078
Oh, Bishop!

20:28.079 --> 20:29.959
Colum... Cormac.

20:29.960 --> 20:32.000
Nice place you have here.

20:33.519 --> 20:37.519
Welcome to Gloucester.
I trust you had a good journey.

20:37.559 --> 20:40.200
Uneventful, thanks be to God.

20:40.240 --> 20:42.519
Haven't we met before?

20:42.559 --> 20:44.359
I don't think so.

20:44.400 --> 20:46.079
In the Parochial House in Drumkeen.

20:46.119 --> 20:48.439
I could have sworn
you were losing your hair.

20:48.440 --> 20:50.960
Bishop Reynard. What a pleasure
to see you as always.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.719
Countess. How honoured we are
by your presence.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.878
I can't wait to get
a glimpse of the cross.

20:55.880 --> 20:57.559
I can barely contain myself.

21:03.680 --> 21:06.480
My Lords, ladies and gentlemen,

21:06.519 --> 21:10.440
may I present the Pelagius Cross!

21:16.720 --> 21:19.680
Guards, secure the building!
Maintenant!

21:22.599 --> 21:24.960
Go back to the Presbytery.
Meet me there.

21:28.279 --> 21:32.279
I'll be a couple of hours.
Oh, and, Terry, when I get back,

21:32.319 --> 21:34.720
I expect to find the young lady
as I left her.

21:58.599 --> 22:00.799
What shall I do with
the guests, Inspector?

22:00.839 --> 22:03.160
None of them went within feet of it.

22:03.200 --> 22:06.200
Take statements, search them
and let them go. Yes, sir.

22:07.680 --> 22:09.798
It must have been
taken from the safe.

22:09.799 --> 22:13.159
Impossible. Or a miracle.
Except I don't believe in miracles.

22:13.160 --> 22:17.400
Please be careful. That is
a holy reliquary blessed by Il Papa.

22:18.839 --> 22:20.598
You failed me, Father.

22:20.599 --> 22:22.960
You said if he turned up
you'd raise the alarm.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.920
This wasn't Flambeau's work.

22:24.960 --> 22:27.960
For once, me and the Padre
are in agreement.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.279
Unless he's invisible
and can walk through walls.

22:31.319 --> 22:32.839
Then how do you explain it?

22:32.880 --> 22:35.279
Elementary. A - it was a miracle

22:35.319 --> 22:38.680
or B - it was an inside job.

22:40.079 --> 22:42.079
What are you suggesting?

22:42.119 --> 22:45.038
As there were only three of us
who knew the combination,

22:45.039 --> 22:47.959
it rather narrows our options.

22:47.960 --> 22:50.439
I hope no-one's pointing
the finger at me.

22:50.440 --> 22:53.759
It seems we are all
under suspicion, non?

22:53.799 --> 22:56.199
Don't try to deflect the blame.

22:56.200 --> 23:00.839
His Holiness placed his trust in you
and you have failed him.

23:00.880 --> 23:04.519
You have brought disgrace
on the name of the Holy See.

23:06.240 --> 23:11.400
I will be tendering my resignation,
but there is work to be done.

23:11.440 --> 23:14.719
We'll all be tendering
our resignations unless it's found.

23:14.720 --> 23:17.119
It didn't magic itself
into thin air.

23:17.160 --> 23:20.759
If it was an inside job, chances are
it's still in the building.

23:28.759 --> 23:30.000
Are you sure it was...

23:30.039 --> 23:31.160
Yes.

23:33.799 --> 23:36.160
The cross disappeared from the safe.

23:37.240 --> 23:39.598
In a locked room
surrounded by guards.

23:39.599 --> 23:41.480
I commend the mastermind
that did it.

23:41.519 --> 23:43.720
What will you do?

23:43.759 --> 23:46.638
I have until seven o'clock,
when I'll go to the drop

23:46.640 --> 23:48.599
and kill Hound with my bare hands.

23:48.640 --> 23:50.480
I'm sure it won't come to that.

23:50.519 --> 23:53.480
You'd rather I defeated him
with platitudes?

23:53.519 --> 23:56.598
I mean, Inspector Mallory thinks
it's an inside job,

23:56.599 --> 24:01.359
so the cross may still be
in the Bishop's Palace.

24:01.400 --> 24:03.240
A palace with over 100 rooms.

24:04.720 --> 24:06.279
You're unusually silent...

24:06.319 --> 24:08.680
Shush! Let the man think.

24:12.400 --> 24:14.799
We're looking at this
the wrong way round.

24:14.839 --> 24:17.200
A jewel vanishes from
a locked and guarded safe,

24:17.240 --> 24:18.839
which we all know is impossible.

24:18.880 --> 24:21.278
I assume there's a point to this?

24:21.279 --> 24:23.759
Let's not dwell on the impossible.

24:23.799 --> 24:25.359
Let's look to the probable.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.558
The jewel wasn't stolen.

24:34.200 --> 24:35.920
'Father!'

24:35.960 --> 24:37.119
My Lord.

24:37.160 --> 24:38.638
Breaking news.

24:38.640 --> 24:42.119
Bishop Cormac was found stripped
and naked in Kembleford Wood.

24:42.160 --> 24:43.398
Flambeau's work.

24:43.400 --> 24:46.079
'Obviously the police are keen
to talk to you but after that

24:46.119 --> 24:49.479
'I expect my "eyes and ears"
explanation on tenterhooks.

24:49.480 --> 24:51.999
'Shall we say two o'clock?'

24:52.000 --> 24:53.959
Mallory.

24:53.960 --> 24:56.679
I'd love to stay and chat,
but I have a prior engagement.

24:56.680 --> 24:58.680
Hang about.

24:58.720 --> 25:01.599
Parlour window. Brings you out
the back of the churchyard.

25:01.640 --> 25:05.440
Please, go upstairs
and give me until six o'clock.

25:07.039 --> 25:10.078
You expect me to believe
you'll find the jewel?

25:10.079 --> 25:12.439
You have no choice.

25:12.440 --> 25:14.880
Six o'clock.
Then I'll do whatever I have to.

25:15.920 --> 25:16.960
Oh, gentlemen.

25:18.599 --> 25:21.640
I think you need
some new spectacles, Padre.

25:24.440 --> 25:26.680
Help! Fire, help!

25:29.240 --> 25:30.359
What the...?

25:37.079 --> 25:38.799
Ecclesiastical security.

26:28.599 --> 26:30.480
You won't find it in there.

26:31.559 --> 26:35.559
Flambeau has it. Bishop Cormac made
a positive identification,

26:35.599 --> 26:37.679
which is
more than can be said for you.

26:37.680 --> 26:40.479
So what have you got to say
for yourself? I'm truly sorry.

26:40.480 --> 26:43.919
Don't play the repentance card.
Do something.

26:43.920 --> 26:47.960
If the jewel isn't recovered
before tomorrow, I'm ruined.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.200
They'll send me to Coventry.
Literally.

26:51.240 --> 26:54.358
And make no mistake, you'll be
coming with me. Is that clear?

26:54.359 --> 26:55.839
Perfectly.

26:55.880 --> 27:00.200
As for the thief, may God have more
mercy on his soul than I will.

27:04.720 --> 27:05.839
Inside.

27:09.240 --> 27:11.920
You're more like your father
than I realised.

27:11.960 --> 27:13.960
And just as irritating.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.200
Now you leave me no choice
but to punish you.

27:22.119 --> 27:23.720
I can't wait any longer.

27:23.759 --> 27:25.720
You stay right where you are.

27:27.200 --> 27:30.038
Are you not going to say anything?
She's his daughter, Mrs M.

27:30.039 --> 27:32.640
And if I don't go now,
you'll be praying for her soul.

27:32.680 --> 27:34.279
Need a wingman?

27:34.319 --> 27:35.920
You don't know Nero Hound.

27:35.960 --> 27:38.319
I wouldn't have your life
on my conscience.

27:40.200 --> 27:41.599
Always knew you had one.

27:44.960 --> 27:47.640
Dear God!
He's stolen the Queen's jewel.

27:47.680 --> 27:50.400
I doubt she'll care.
What on earth would she wear it with?

27:50.440 --> 27:51.720
Who? And how?

27:51.759 --> 27:54.960
At the moment,
that's the least of your concerns.

27:56.240 --> 27:57.839
I suppose I'm in your debt.

27:59.519 --> 28:01.079
I'm coming with you.

28:01.119 --> 28:02.720
You'd only slow me down.

28:02.759 --> 28:04.079
It's not a request.

28:05.759 --> 28:09.358
If Hound has harmed
a hair on her head...

28:09.359 --> 28:10.799
he'll be needing a priest.

28:32.200 --> 28:33.200
Time?

28:34.640 --> 28:36.400
Um...

28:36.440 --> 28:38.240
A minute to seven.

28:38.279 --> 28:40.720
Nero! I have the jewel!

28:44.200 --> 28:45.400
Something's wrong.

29:01.559 --> 29:03.640
She's not here.
So there's still hope.

29:08.759 --> 29:10.559
I will tear him limb from limb.

29:12.960 --> 29:15.278
I didn't know you cared.

29:15.279 --> 29:17.240
Allo, Papa.

29:17.279 --> 29:19.759
Where's Hound? Then again...

29:19.759 --> 29:22.519
He's locked in the cellar
and his thug's in the outhouse.

29:22.519 --> 29:23.960
Did they hurt you?

29:24.000 --> 29:25.358
Not as much as I hurt them.

29:25.359 --> 29:27.159
You overpowered two men?

29:27.160 --> 29:30.278
I had no high expectations
of your arrival.

29:30.279 --> 29:32.319
Where's the jewel?

29:32.359 --> 29:34.038
I have questions first.

29:34.039 --> 29:36.759
In case you hadn't noticed,
I'm the one holding a gun.

29:36.799 --> 29:40.559
Come on. The smell in here
is making me sick. Chop chop.

29:49.400 --> 29:52.638
That won't be necessary.
You know I'm no threat.

29:52.640 --> 29:55.038
I don't know you from Adam.

29:55.039 --> 29:57.359
I don't even know what to call you.

29:57.400 --> 30:00.519
Papa? Monsieur Flambeau?

30:00.559 --> 30:03.960
Daddy seems rather informal
given our lack of acquaintance.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.599
I wouldn't worry about it.

30:05.640 --> 30:08.358
Our touching reunion
will be short and sweet.

30:08.359 --> 30:09.919
The jewel?

30:09.920 --> 30:13.319
I'm curious to see
the object worthy of my life.

30:31.839 --> 30:33.200
I'm flattered.

30:38.319 --> 30:39.720
Russian baroque.

30:40.880 --> 30:42.440
Maxim Korytov.

30:44.519 --> 30:47.000
I'm surprised you didn't keep it.

30:47.039 --> 30:49.279
It would sit well in
Le Voleur's collection.

30:50.920 --> 30:53.959
Given our lack of acquaintance,
you know a lot about me.

30:53.960 --> 30:57.000
I've studied your career
since my mother's death,

30:57.039 --> 31:00.680
when I discovered the identity
of my "secret benefactor".

31:02.000 --> 31:05.920
The Star of David,
the St Jerome triptych...

31:05.960 --> 31:08.359
It was you who stole
the St Jerome triptych?

31:08.400 --> 31:10.519
The Duchess of Bourbon's diamonds...

31:10.519 --> 31:12.200
That wasn't me.

31:12.240 --> 31:15.200
I did wonder.
The theft was cruder than usual.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.319
How did you escape?

31:21.519 --> 31:24.599
I waited for Hound to leave
and started a fire.

31:24.640 --> 31:27.920
Unfortunately he returned
earlier than expected.

31:27.960 --> 31:30.719
You're more like your father
than I realised.

31:30.720 --> 31:32.920
And just as irritating.

31:32.960 --> 31:35.559
Now you leave me no choice
but to punish you.

31:40.000 --> 31:43.119
You expect me to believe you shot
a gun from his hand at 20 feet?

31:43.160 --> 31:44.519
Hardly. I was way off my mark.

31:44.559 --> 31:46.078
I was aiming for his heart.

31:46.079 --> 31:47.838
You need to account for the recoil.

31:47.839 --> 31:50.439
I'm much more at ease
with a fencing sabre.

31:50.440 --> 31:54.039
Rest assured, the money lavished
on my education was well spent.

31:54.079 --> 31:55.519
I gave you every advantage.

31:55.559 --> 31:56.519
Except one.

31:58.519 --> 32:00.519
You were better off without me.

32:00.519 --> 32:03.038
Only I can be the judge of that.

32:03.039 --> 32:05.640
I bear no resemblance to my mother.

32:05.680 --> 32:09.720
As a child I'd look in the mirror
and see the face of a stranger.

32:09.759 --> 32:12.358
Like half of me was missing.

32:12.359 --> 32:13.720
I'll make a cup of tea.

32:13.759 --> 32:15.000
Please don't shoot me.

32:17.359 --> 32:18.839
Is the priest real?

32:18.880 --> 32:21.519
Very. So I'd advise you
to watch what you say.

32:21.519 --> 32:23.358
You keep strange friends.

32:23.359 --> 32:24.720
He's no friend of mine.

32:25.799 --> 32:28.799
I thought we understood each other
rather well.

32:28.839 --> 32:30.640
You stole the jewel for me.

32:30.680 --> 32:33.078
Technically, I stole it.

32:33.079 --> 32:36.720
And if it's not returned I will spend
the rest of my life in Coventry.

32:36.759 --> 32:38.359
Parts of it are quite pleasant.

32:38.400 --> 32:41.400
I hear they're building
a new cathedral. Ha, ha.

32:41.440 --> 32:45.880
A pet priest stealing from his own.
Why would he do that for you?

32:45.920 --> 32:47.880
Moral blackmail.

32:47.920 --> 32:49.720
A victim of his own conscience.

32:49.759 --> 32:51.759
He really is a priest?

32:51.799 --> 32:55.799
My God sets no store
by earthly treasures.

32:55.839 --> 32:57.880
Your God is a killjoy.

33:07.920 --> 33:09.640
What news?

33:09.680 --> 33:14.319
Interpol have been alerted and are
watching every entry port to France.

33:14.359 --> 33:16.798
There is still hope.

33:16.799 --> 33:18.640
Not for Cardinal Brunocelli.

33:19.839 --> 33:21.640
God rest his soul.

33:23.279 --> 33:25.680
And still no word of his successor.

33:27.519 --> 33:30.559
Although that will be of
little interest to you now.

33:33.640 --> 33:35.400
I thought you were dead.

33:35.440 --> 33:38.959
You left me for dead
in a Bogota prison.

33:38.960 --> 33:41.759
An ungallant way
to treat your partner.

33:41.799 --> 33:43.759
I didn't like your methods.

33:43.799 --> 33:48.039
I didn't expect you
to be quite so squeamish.

33:48.079 --> 33:49.839
How did you esc...? Be quiet.

33:50.920 --> 33:52.919
Your daughter has very pretty hands.

33:52.920 --> 33:54.960
But not so deft at tying knots.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.798
You have what you want.
Now she will leave.

33:57.799 --> 33:59.479
Not yet.

33:59.480 --> 34:03.240
We had a deal.
The jewel for the girl.

34:03.279 --> 34:05.719
I have a new score to settle now.

34:05.720 --> 34:08.039
Your brat shot off
one of my fingers.

34:09.480 --> 34:12.400
You and I will negotiate
compensation in private.

34:12.440 --> 34:15.840
In the meantime you have the cross
and she WILL leave.

34:15.880 --> 34:18.079
Go. Now. Both of you.

34:19.159 --> 34:20.400
No!

34:21.559 --> 34:23.559
It's profoundly biblical.

34:23.599 --> 34:25.199
An eye for an eye.

34:25.239 --> 34:27.440
Or in this case, a hand for a hand.

34:46.960 --> 34:48.159
You're wounded.

34:48.199 --> 34:50.159
I'll live long enough to kill him.

34:50.159 --> 34:52.838
Stop! Stop!
Vengeance is the Lord's alone.

34:52.840 --> 34:54.960
Back off, priest!
This is not your battle.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.599
Unless you want a life
on your conscience, stop him.

34:57.639 --> 34:59.719
Please, don't kill him
on my account.

35:07.880 --> 35:09.079
The prize is mine.

35:14.800 --> 35:17.599
I would say au revoir,
but once the police are alerted

35:17.639 --> 35:21.278
to your whereabouts, you're looking
at 30 years with parole.

35:21.280 --> 35:22.280
Goodbye, Nero.

35:30.920 --> 35:34.480
Will you return the jewel to the
priest? He risked his all for me.

35:34.519 --> 35:36.480
He'll get his reward in heaven.

35:36.519 --> 35:40.039
What? I warned you'd be better off
not knowing me.

35:40.079 --> 35:41.159
So what happens now?

35:41.199 --> 35:42.360
I need to sit down.

35:42.400 --> 35:43.958
To us?

35:43.960 --> 35:46.320
You will return to your studies.

35:46.360 --> 35:48.440
My PhD is almost complete.

35:48.480 --> 35:51.519
A catalogue of the finest
private collections in Europe.

35:51.559 --> 35:55.159
With the owners' full co-operation,
naturally. After that,

35:55.159 --> 35:59.239
there are limited career paths open
to orphan girls of good education.

35:59.280 --> 36:01.639
Perhaps you're in need of
some fatherly advice.

36:01.639 --> 36:03.800
Guard this.
He isn't as simple as he looks.

36:05.400 --> 36:07.760
He's lucky.
The bullet passed right through.

36:07.800 --> 36:09.199
I don't believe in luck.

36:09.239 --> 36:11.639
Can you find something
to make bandages with?

36:16.119 --> 36:17.478
What are you doing?!

36:17.480 --> 36:19.199
What? Making up for lost time.

36:19.199 --> 36:22.838
Let her go. We've only just met.
Now you expect me to let her go?

36:22.840 --> 36:24.998
You're her father,
you should protect her...

36:25.000 --> 36:26.920
Unfounded, given
recent turn of events.

36:26.960 --> 36:29.958
..from whatever unholy alliance
you are planning.

36:29.960 --> 36:31.800
She'd make a worthy pupil.

36:31.840 --> 36:34.320
And how long till
she's corrupted and defiled

36:34.360 --> 36:36.719
and her heart is as black as yours?

36:36.719 --> 36:38.998
Now you're in danger of
being predictable.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.320
The difference is, I now know
that you have a conscience.

36:43.960 --> 36:46.159
This is the only antiseptic
I could find.

36:50.280 --> 36:51.719
Ready?

36:51.719 --> 36:52.880
Ready.

36:57.159 --> 36:58.960
Take the jewel if you must.

37:00.239 --> 37:03.039
But she is innocent.
Do not take her soul.

37:03.039 --> 37:05.840
Yours are not the only wounds
that need attending.

37:30.280 --> 37:31.440
Flambeau, stop!

37:46.199 --> 37:50.360
I went to school with the daughter
of the Marquis of Apreville.

37:50.400 --> 37:52.199
His security is highly flawed.

37:52.239 --> 37:55.719
And his Netsuke are magnificent.
And extremely portable.

37:57.119 --> 37:58.918
Would you have mown down the priest?

37:58.920 --> 38:00.760
Ha! He had his God to protect him.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.239
How does it feel to take a life?

38:04.239 --> 38:08.039
That's an inappropriate question
for a young lady of breeding.

38:08.079 --> 38:11.239
I ask because part of me wishes
you had killed Hound

38:11.239 --> 38:13.719
and part of me regrets I didn't.

38:15.519 --> 38:17.360
You need a doctor.

38:17.400 --> 38:19.199
No doctors.

38:19.199 --> 38:22.079
Then some surgical needle and thread
and I'll stitch it.

38:26.760 --> 38:27.960
This is as far as we go.

38:29.239 --> 38:30.440
I don't understand.

38:32.599 --> 38:34.840
You are a remarkable young woman

38:34.880 --> 38:39.318
but if I'd wanted a daughter, do you think
I'd have waited 23 years to find you?

38:39.320 --> 38:40.960
We have a connection.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.918
You don't know me from Adam.

38:42.920 --> 38:44.599
I know you feel something.

38:44.639 --> 38:47.079
Guilt? Regret?

38:47.079 --> 38:50.559
I would never allow
such self-indulgence.

38:50.599 --> 38:52.759
You're making a mistake.

38:52.760 --> 38:54.960
I am you.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
Together we could be invincible.

39:00.599 --> 39:02.960
The jewel, if you please.

39:16.400 --> 39:17.679
We won't meet again.

39:19.000 --> 39:20.440
So long, Marianne.

39:51.960 --> 39:54.159
It's not there.

39:54.199 --> 39:56.639
I don't know
what you're talking about.

39:58.760 --> 40:03.239
A jewel vanishes into thin air
from a locked safe.

40:03.239 --> 40:04.440
Must be magic.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.599
But magic doesn't exist.

40:09.639 --> 40:11.000
Only illusion.

40:12.679 --> 40:14.438
And who knows that better...

40:16.320 --> 40:19.400
..than the son of The Great Marvel?

40:20.719 --> 40:24.719
A few adjustments to the casket
is all it took.

40:24.760 --> 40:25.679
Excellent.

40:40.119 --> 40:42.159
Flambeau has it.

40:42.199 --> 40:44.400
He must have switched the caskets.

40:45.679 --> 40:49.958
I have taken a vow of poverty.
What value is a bauble to me?

40:49.960 --> 40:51.960
Priceless, in terms of ambition.

40:53.400 --> 40:55.480
With Cardinal Papillon discredited,

40:55.519 --> 40:58.039
the Secretary of State's
position is yours.

41:00.960 --> 41:04.119
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

41:04.159 --> 41:06.559
It has been one day
since my last confession.

41:07.800 --> 41:13.880
You'd hold me to the sacred seal
to ruin an innocent man's career?

41:13.920 --> 41:18.440
I wouldn't expect a rural priest to
understand the niceties of politics.

41:19.960 --> 41:22.000
I don't expect God does either.

41:22.039 --> 41:26.280
Well, well, Father,
aren't you the surprise?

41:26.320 --> 41:29.199
This was delivered to
the police station addressed to you,

41:29.239 --> 41:32.838
so naturally I opened it,
and lookee here...

41:32.840 --> 41:35.440
I'm agog as to how you explain this.

41:36.440 --> 41:38.039
I can't.

41:38.079 --> 41:41.719
But what I do know is under
the seal of the confessional.

41:41.760 --> 41:44.318
You'll have to do better than that.

41:44.320 --> 41:48.039
There's not another man in this room
that would agree with that statement.

41:48.079 --> 41:51.199
Quite. Even so,
you must have something?

41:53.519 --> 41:56.159
What I can say is that

41:56.199 --> 41:59.960
His Holiness has cause to look
favourably on Cardinal Papillon.

42:04.880 --> 42:06.920
I don't know
what he's talking about.

42:08.760 --> 42:11.239
Your humility is a credit to you.

42:11.280 --> 42:16.478
Indeed it is. You can rely on me to
convey knowledge of his assistance

42:16.480 --> 42:17.880
to the Holy Father.

42:30.719 --> 42:33.719
So all's well that ends well.

42:33.760 --> 42:36.360
It ended well for Papillon.

42:36.400 --> 42:39.838
He's been appointed
Cardinal Secretary of State.

42:39.840 --> 42:41.920
Why would Flambeau return the jewel?

42:43.920 --> 42:46.119
I've been thinking
the same thing myself.

42:59.920 --> 43:02.159
Touche, ma fille!

43:04.199 --> 43:06.440
It certainly seems
out of character.

43:07.679 --> 43:09.159
Hello.

43:11.039 --> 43:13.079
One of his little games.

43:13.079 --> 43:16.159
Or maybe the man has finally
found a conscience.

43:28.039 --> 43:29.400
Maybe he has.
