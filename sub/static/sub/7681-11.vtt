01:20.640 --> 01:23.871
When I was about 10,
I got my first chemistry set.

01:24.040 --> 01:27.237
I've been a beaker-and-test-tube nut
ever since.

01:27.400 --> 01:29.516
My mom said I was gonna
come up with a formula

01:29.680 --> 01:31.989
that would either
improve the world...

01:32.160 --> 01:34.628
... or blow up the house.

01:39.040 --> 01:41.600
I kind of felt like
I was in an old movie.

01:41.760 --> 01:45.230
The sound of the rain and thunder,
the flashes of lightning

01:45.400 --> 01:49.075
and me, working alone
on a top-secret project.

01:50.240 --> 01:51.753
I'm not sure why,

01:51.920 --> 01:54.878
but I could sense that this time,
everything was gonna click.

01:55.040 --> 01:57.918
And then I'd finally complete
the formula I'd been working on

01:58.080 --> 01:59.672
for such a long time.

01:59.840 --> 02:03.037
But I also knew that every drop
I added to the mixture

02:03.200 --> 02:06.397
could mean the difference
between success and failure,

02:06.560 --> 02:09.996
between Jekyll and Hyde.

02:21.720 --> 02:24.757
Whenever they talk about an
overnight scientific breakthrough,

02:24.920 --> 02:28.151
you can bet it took years
of trial and error.

02:28.320 --> 02:31.437
And when all those experiments
look like they're about to pay off,

02:31.600 --> 02:34.592
well, you can get
a kind of tunnel vision.

02:34.760 --> 02:36.671
All you see are those glass tubes,

02:36.840 --> 02:40.310
and the rest of the world
just sort of disappears.

02:45.840 --> 02:48.832
H i, Harry. Raining out?

02:49.000 --> 02:51.833
No, I took a walk in a car wash.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.353
You've been gone
an awful Iong time.

02:53.520 --> 02:55.670
Ain't you been working on this
Iong enough, whatever it is?

02:55.840 --> 02:58.991
Yes, I certainly have.
It's time for the test.

02:59.160 --> 03:01.879
- What kind of a test?
- The ultimate test.

03:02.040 --> 03:04.679
Well, hold it. What if you got
the wrong kind of bromide in there?

03:05.640 --> 03:08.074
Bud, you okay?

03:08.680 --> 03:09.829
Speak to me.

03:11.200 --> 03:13.316
It's great. You gotta have some.

03:13.960 --> 03:18.238
- Not till you tell me what it is.
- It's eggnog. Nonalcoholic eggnog.

03:18.400 --> 03:20.630
Nonalcoholic eggnog?

03:20.880 --> 03:22.108
- You're putting me on.
- Nope.

03:22.280 --> 03:24.191
You sure the world needs
a drink Iike this?

03:25.280 --> 03:29.637
- What happened to your finger?
- Oh, the perils of science. Drink up.

03:33.640 --> 03:36.837
Hope you didn't spend
too much time developing this.

03:42.920 --> 03:45.309
Another December 1 4th.

03:45.600 --> 03:48.319
Hard to believe it's been 25 years.

03:48.480 --> 03:51.631
I'm glad you're here, Harry.
Especially today.

03:51.840 --> 03:54.718
Well, when you said we were
gonna see Gretzky and the Oilers,

03:54.880 --> 03:57.155
I figured it was worth a trip.

03:59.520 --> 04:01.078
Yeah.

04:06.720 --> 04:08.392
It's been two hours.

04:08.560 --> 04:11.597
This operation against the Phoenix
Foundation is never gonna work.

04:11.760 --> 04:13.273
I don't remember
asking your opinion.

04:13.440 --> 04:14.919
How much Ionger
are we gonna wait?

04:15.360 --> 04:17.190
As Iong as it takes for Murphy
to come out.

04:17.360 --> 04:20.192
What makes you think
that the building's empty?

04:20.360 --> 04:23.193
It's Sunday night.
Murphy's is the only car here.

04:23.360 --> 04:26.079
Well, someone else could show up.
Maybe Karl--

04:26.320 --> 04:27.719
No names!

04:29.400 --> 04:32.870
The Liberation Front
hired me to do this job.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.678
They sent you to back me up.

04:35.280 --> 04:38.033
We go inside,
we activate the device,

04:38.200 --> 04:41.158
the building blows up
and we walk away,

04:41.320 --> 04:44.278
never to see each other again.

04:44.760 --> 04:46.034
Is that clear?

04:49.080 --> 04:51.640
- Yeah.
- Good.

04:53.360 --> 04:55.510
I can't wait to see Gretzky
and those Oilers skate.

04:55.680 --> 04:56.908
Our seats anywhere near the ice?

04:57.080 --> 04:59.310
CIose enough to hear
some pretty outrageous Ianguage.

04:59.480 --> 05:01.869
Great! Never seen Gretzky
in person.

05:02.040 --> 05:03.473
Figured I never would--

05:03.640 --> 05:05.312
- What's the matter?
- The tickets.

05:05.480 --> 05:06.833
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.274
You don't know?

05:08.440 --> 05:11.671
Did you Iose them? I come all the way
from Minnesota to see this game.

05:11.840 --> 05:13.876
Harry, will you Iet me--?
Let me think. Let me think.

05:14.440 --> 05:16.908
He gave them to me in his office.
We went down to the computer bay

05:17.080 --> 05:20.117
to access the Tompkins file,
back to his office...

05:20.280 --> 05:21.918
They gotta be at
the Phoenix Foundation.

05:22.080 --> 05:25.311
Come on, Harry.
We can still make opening face-off!

05:32.880 --> 05:34.996
There's Murphy.

05:36.440 --> 05:39.477
- Murphy's a woman!
- What sharp Iittle eyes you have.

05:41.440 --> 05:43.158
Let's go.

05:48.840 --> 05:51.957
Aren't you from the eighth floor?

05:52.120 --> 05:53.838
Physics research
or something Iike that?

05:54.000 --> 05:55.718
- Fourth. Demographics.
- Oh, yeah.

05:55.880 --> 05:58.235
I thought I'd seen you
someplace before.

05:58.400 --> 05:59.958
I'm Victoria James.

06:00.440 --> 06:02.032
Susan Murphy.

06:08.280 --> 06:11.033
Find her car key and put the body
in the trunk of the car.

06:11.320 --> 06:12.799
Wait!

06:26.200 --> 06:28.111
--I'd seen you someplace before.

06:28.280 --> 06:31.875
- I'm Victoria James.
- Susan Murphy.

06:40.480 --> 06:42.710
I Iove the fuzz, Harry.

06:42.880 --> 06:45.235
You run out of shaving cream
back home, or what?

06:45.400 --> 06:47.834
I forgot to do it this morning.

06:49.800 --> 06:52.678
Harry Jackson, you've got
that sandpaper beard again.

06:52.840 --> 06:55.308
Will you please remember to shave?

07:01.000 --> 07:02.877
You know, it's gotta be
at Ieast 20 years

07:03.040 --> 07:05.076
since we've seen a game together.

07:05.360 --> 07:06.918
Yeah.

07:07.080 --> 07:08.832
I don't wanna miss
a second of it, either.

07:09.320 --> 07:11.436
Don't worry.
I know all the shortcuts.

07:13.440 --> 07:15.715
Remember when you were a kid,

07:15.880 --> 07:18.075
that winter I taught you
how to skate backwards?

07:18.240 --> 07:21.710
Oh, I can't forget it.
Spent the whole winter on my butt.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.840
Ever think of putting doors on this
thing before somebody gets drowned?

07:29.000 --> 07:31.309
Haven't Iost a passenger yet, Harry.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.434
Hey, bud, where in the sam hill
are you going?

07:37.720 --> 07:40.917
Dad, who's Sam Hill?

07:42.840 --> 07:45.229
You been talking
to your Grandpa Harry again?

07:45.400 --> 07:46.879
Yeah.

07:47.040 --> 07:49.076
Who's Sam Hill?

07:54.840 --> 07:56.273
I don't know why
the Front's using her.

07:56.440 --> 07:58.112
She doesn't believe
in what we're fighting for.

07:58.280 --> 08:00.840
- She's only in it for the money.
- Look, we've used outsiders before.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.752
She designed and planted
the bomb at the airport.

08:02.920 --> 08:04.433
She's supposed to be very good.

08:04.600 --> 08:06.989
If she's so good,
how come the bomb didn't go off?

08:07.160 --> 08:09.230
It didn't go off
because my support team

08:09.400 --> 08:11.630
virtually invited the police
to the scene.

08:11.800 --> 08:14.314
Not to mention the experts
from the Phoenix Foundation.

08:14.480 --> 08:16.869
Hey, we don't Iike the Phoenix
Foundation any more than you do.

08:17.040 --> 08:19.315
And they're gonna pay the price
for interfering with our plans.

08:19.480 --> 08:22.074
Well, I don't really care
about your reasons.

08:22.240 --> 08:23.434
I'm going to detonate the device

08:23.600 --> 08:25.909
because I don't want it traced
back to me.

08:33.880 --> 08:36.599
Leave the doors open
and watch for my signal.

08:39.240 --> 08:41.116
- Help you, miss?
- Excuse me, I've Iost my voice.

08:41.280 --> 08:43.635
- I can't--
- What's that again?

08:46.720 --> 08:48.312
Come on!

08:50.040 --> 08:51.792
He'II be out for hours.
Lock him in an elevator.

08:51.960 --> 08:55.396
- What floor are we going to?
- Eight, where the main computer is.

08:58.320 --> 09:00.311
Release one of the elevators.

09:25.800 --> 09:27.791
You'II get a kick out of seeing
the Phoenix Foundation.

09:27.960 --> 09:31.635
I got no time for sightseeing.
Not if we're going to a hockey game.

09:39.240 --> 09:42.118
- Come on, bud, we gotta go.
- Oh, keep your hat on, Harry.

09:42.280 --> 09:46.193
There's 60 minutes of ice time.
There's plenty of time.

09:58.400 --> 10:02.359
Card-key access verified.
Voice identification, please.

10:03.920 --> 10:05.478
Susan Murphy.

10:08.560 --> 10:10.391
That's perfect!
That tape recorder worked perfect!

10:10.560 --> 10:14.439
It's a Iaser-assisted
digital recorder. I built it.

10:14.600 --> 10:16.033
Why do you need the computer?

10:16.200 --> 10:19.317
Why don't we just set the bomb
and blow the building up?

10:19.640 --> 10:23.553
In order for me to activate the device,
I have to do one very important thing.

10:23.720 --> 10:26.029
Can you guess what that is?

10:26.200 --> 10:28.873
- Find it?
- Very good.

10:35.880 --> 10:37.154
Hi. How you doing tonight?

10:37.320 --> 10:39.959
- Where's Lou?
- Home, sick. Touch of the flu, I hear.

10:40.120 --> 10:41.394
It's going around.

10:41.560 --> 10:44.028
Name's MacGyver.
I'm on the clearance Iist.

10:44.200 --> 10:46.998
I Ieft some hockey tickets upstairs.

10:47.320 --> 10:49.436
- He's with me.
- I'II release the elevator for you then.

10:49.600 --> 10:51.079
I'd appreciate it.

10:51.240 --> 10:53.390
Use car number two.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.753
- How we doing?
- I'm doing fine.

11:01.920 --> 11:04.309
Would you put that cigarette out?

11:06.240 --> 11:09.676
Surprised they'd Iet you in
without an ID.

11:10.040 --> 11:12.429
Well, you told them I was with you.

11:12.600 --> 11:14.955
Yeah, but Security's usually
a Iittle more strict

11:15.120 --> 11:17.475
about who they Iet in here.

11:23.960 --> 11:26.428
Got a call from downstairs.
Two guys are coming up.

11:27.360 --> 11:29.954
I haven't Iocated the device yet.

11:30.720 --> 11:32.153
Take the equipment
and get out of here.

11:32.320 --> 11:34.151
I'II meet you in the stairwell.

11:48.680 --> 11:50.671
I'm telling you,
we'II never make the game.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.956
Can't see the game
without tickets, Harry.

11:55.200 --> 11:58.397
Card-key access verified.
Voice identification, please.

11:58.560 --> 12:00.278
MacGyver.

12:03.840 --> 12:06.354
Sunday night.
That's what I call dedication.

12:06.520 --> 12:08.112
Well, it's what I call fear.

12:08.280 --> 12:12.671
My boss says he wants these figures
by Monday morning or I am doomed.

12:12.840 --> 12:13.955
My name's MacGyver.

12:14.360 --> 12:16.715
This is my grandfather,
Harry Jackson.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.436
Susan Murphy. I've heard
an awful Iot about you.

12:20.600 --> 12:22.830
- Anything good?
- Some.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.594
- We better get moving.
- Yeah, Harry, we will.

12:25.760 --> 12:26.829
What kind of work you doing?

12:27.320 --> 12:29.436
Oh, I just had to access
some demographic figures.

12:29.600 --> 12:30.828
I'm almost through now.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.070
- Bud.
- Yeah. Okay, Harry.

12:33.240 --> 12:36.118
- We'II see you again.
- I'm sure of it.

12:39.560 --> 12:41.869
Well, I know I didn't Ieave the tickets
in the computer bay.

12:42.040 --> 12:44.190
They gotta be here somewhere.

13:03.480 --> 13:05.198
There it is.

13:21.040 --> 13:22.996
Nice to meet you.

13:26.040 --> 13:28.759
Maybe the tickets aren't here.
Maybe your friend Pete took them.

13:28.920 --> 13:31.559
No, he doesn't Iike hockey.

13:32.080 --> 13:34.640
How can you work
for a guy Iike that?

13:39.000 --> 13:41.389
Tell the Iobby to kill the elevators
and secure the stairwell door.

13:41.560 --> 13:43.437
- What for?
- Have him cut the outside phone Iines,

13:43.600 --> 13:46.114
- but not the intercom system.
- I don't see why you're doing this.

13:46.280 --> 13:49.238
You don't have to see why
I'm doing it, just do what I tell you.

13:49.400 --> 13:51.038
Get on the phone,
I wanna talk to your people.

13:51.200 --> 13:52.997
- We gonna blow the building now?
- Soon.

13:53.160 --> 13:54.479
We're gonna blow the building soon.

13:54.640 --> 13:56.392
I don't think we're gonna make it
to that game.

13:56.560 --> 13:58.869
Come on, Harry. Be positive.

13:59.040 --> 14:02.191
I'm positive we ain't gonna make it
to that game.

14:04.440 --> 14:06.431
The Liberation Front.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.875
Yes, I've Iocated the device.

14:10.040 --> 14:12.952
But there's a man in the building
named MacGyver.

14:13.120 --> 14:16.590
Wasn't he the one who stopped
your assassination attempt in Kuwait?

14:17.440 --> 14:19.431
Yes, I thought you might.

14:20.360 --> 14:23.158
Of course I can, but he's not
part of our original deal.

14:37.400 --> 14:39.038
I got it!

14:39.200 --> 14:41.316
When Pete and I came back
from the computer bay,

14:41.480 --> 14:44.756
we were talking
about the Tompkins file.

14:44.920 --> 14:46.831
- What are you Iooking for?
- The Tompkins file.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.070
There they are. Let's go!

14:56.360 --> 15:00.592
Yes, but the point is,
how much is MacGyver worth to you?

15:01.760 --> 15:04.593
Somehow I think you can do
a Iot better than that.

15:05.520 --> 15:06.919
Done.

15:08.760 --> 15:11.558
- Get MacGyver and the old man.
- Why bother?

15:11.720 --> 15:13.915
The building's Iocked down.
You're gonna set the bomb.

15:14.080 --> 15:18.039
He's smart enough to figure a way out
before I can arm the device.

15:18.680 --> 15:22.036
MacGyver's the best man
that the Phoenix Foundation has.

15:22.200 --> 15:24.316
If he's dead, it'II help your cause.

15:24.480 --> 15:27.517
You don't know anything
about our cause.

15:27.680 --> 15:30.194
No, but I know a Iot
about $1 00,000,

15:30.360 --> 15:32.999
which is what the Front
is willing to pay.

15:33.160 --> 15:35.674
Find him. Kill him.

15:36.200 --> 15:37.792
Kill them both.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.753
Bud, I gotta hand it to you.
I never thought we'd find them in time.

15:48.120 --> 15:50.588
I knew these tickets
would show up sooner or Iater.

15:50.760 --> 15:52.432
Well, at my age,
they better show up sooner.

15:52.600 --> 15:54.636
Oh, come on, Harry.
You're gonna go on forever.

15:55.040 --> 15:56.598
That's what I used to think.

15:56.760 --> 15:59.957
Oh, just for safekeeping,
I'II put these puppies in my pocket.

16:06.880 --> 16:09.348
Gonna put these puppies
in my pocket.

16:10.440 --> 16:12.396
How come you want me
to call you Harry?

16:12.760 --> 16:15.638
- That's my name.
- But you're my grandpa.

16:15.840 --> 16:17.398
Yep.

16:17.560 --> 16:20.074
But "Grandpa" is for an old man.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.515
Name's Harry.

16:22.680 --> 16:24.477
Your move.

16:27.880 --> 16:29.791
What's wrong with this thing?

16:32.880 --> 16:35.189
You don't suppose they forgot
we're here, shut down the building?

16:35.360 --> 16:38.158
No, we haven't signed out yet.

16:39.400 --> 16:41.868
Something's weird here.

16:43.640 --> 16:45.232
Lipstick.

16:45.400 --> 16:46.594
What?

16:46.760 --> 16:48.751
That girl we just met, Susan,
she was wearing Iipstick,

16:48.920 --> 16:51.309
but there wasn't any
on her cigarette.

16:52.600 --> 16:53.919
What cigarette?

16:54.080 --> 16:55.718
You didn't smell the smoke
in the room?

16:55.880 --> 16:59.953
There was a fresh cigarette
in the ashtray, but no Iipstick on it.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.951
PIus, she said she was working
demographics.

17:02.120 --> 17:05.078
The Demographic department's
on the fourth floor. This is the eighth.

17:05.240 --> 17:06.673
A security guard
I've never seen before,

17:06.839 --> 17:10.355
I don't Iike what's going on here.
Well, Iet's check the stairway.

17:26.040 --> 17:27.758
- What are you doing?
- Quiet!

17:42.520 --> 17:43.839
God! Harry!

17:46.200 --> 17:48.270
What the hell's going on?
Why are they shooting at us?

17:48.440 --> 17:51.512
I guess those tickets
are hotter than I thought.

18:09.720 --> 18:10.914
What are you doing?

18:11.080 --> 18:13.310
SIowing down the hydraulics
on this door.

18:22.680 --> 18:24.272
Come on.

18:46.680 --> 18:49.274
- Let's go, Harry.
- That's easy for you to say.

18:49.440 --> 18:50.919
You're not running on my knees.

18:55.240 --> 18:58.710
Put the equipment down. Open
the cases, but don't take anything out.

19:10.920 --> 19:13.115
Don't touch that!

19:28.640 --> 19:30.278
That's the bomb?

19:30.440 --> 19:32.032
Looks just Iike a Iittle suitcase.

19:32.200 --> 19:35.749
Yes, well, I find it more convenient
than a brown paper bag.

19:35.920 --> 19:37.069
What's your name, anyway?

19:37.240 --> 19:39.754
Fred. But you said
you didn't wanna know our names.

19:39.920 --> 19:42.070
Yours I wanna remember.

19:42.240 --> 19:43.992
Come on, Iet's get to work.

19:52.760 --> 19:55.194
This is a fire door.
It's never supposed to be Iocked.

19:59.640 --> 20:00.914
There's a New York Iock on it.

20:01.080 --> 20:04.231
It's got a suction base. The harder
you push, the stronger it gets.

20:04.400 --> 20:06.231
Who put it there?

20:07.200 --> 20:10.476
I'd be willing to guess
that guy at the desk.

20:11.120 --> 20:14.430
- You saying we're trapped in here?
- Yeah.

20:14.600 --> 20:16.113
Why'd they wanna do that?

20:16.280 --> 20:19.113
I don't know, Harry.
I really don't know.

20:19.280 --> 20:21.589
- Where are we going?
- Well, there's a Iab on the third floor.

20:21.760 --> 20:25.070
Maybe we can find what we need
to open that door.

20:26.040 --> 20:27.553
You all right?

20:27.720 --> 20:30.518
There was a time I could run all day
without breaking a sweat.

20:30.680 --> 20:32.910
I tell you, it's hell getting old.

20:33.080 --> 20:34.718
Age is only in the mind, Harry.

20:34.880 --> 20:37.997
Well, my mind tells me
I'm getting old.

20:42.160 --> 20:45.391
I better call Pete.
He can get things moving.

20:48.240 --> 20:51.915
Line's dead. Let's get to that Iab.

21:00.920 --> 21:03.559
They gotta be
around here somewhere.

21:20.600 --> 21:22.591
Wouldn't it have been easier
just to bring another bomb

21:22.760 --> 21:24.512
and set it off in the basement?

21:25.320 --> 21:27.629
I don't want anything Ieft
of this one.

21:28.040 --> 21:31.669
I built it. The design is as personal
as a fingerprint.

21:32.360 --> 21:36.797
The Ionger they have to study it,
the closer they get to me.

21:36.960 --> 21:38.951
I don't want anybody
closing in on me.

21:45.080 --> 21:47.833
There's gotta be a reason
those guys are after us.

21:49.160 --> 21:52.038
You know some secrets
about this Phoenix place?

21:52.200 --> 21:54.998
No, the Foundation
just does research, Harry.

21:55.160 --> 21:57.071
It's a think tank.

21:58.200 --> 22:01.431
Well, we're going in the tank
if we don't think of a way out of here.

22:15.760 --> 22:17.671
If we can't push through
that New York Iock,

22:17.840 --> 22:20.638
maybe we can slide it
out of the way.

22:20.800 --> 22:23.030
What do you got in mind?

22:23.480 --> 22:27.359
Dry-cell batteries and copper wire
and an iron bar.

22:27.520 --> 22:29.397
Think I know what you're going for.

22:29.560 --> 22:32.597
- Ought to work fine.
- I hope so.

22:32.760 --> 22:35.797
There's our 24 volts of juice.

22:37.400 --> 22:39.868
This will be our iron bar.

22:42.520 --> 22:45.830
And that's where they keep
the good stuff, Harry.

22:57.360 --> 22:58.952
I knew it.

22:59.120 --> 23:01.236
Help me out here, Harry.

23:07.040 --> 23:09.793
Remind you of that magnet
I built that summer?

23:09.960 --> 23:13.430
Used it to pick up shoeing nails
out of the horse stalls.

23:13.600 --> 23:17.195
Seems kind of strange not being up
at the farm this time of year.

23:17.360 --> 23:20.955
AIways wanted to be alone
about this time.

23:21.800 --> 23:23.392
Yeah, I've asked you down
every year.

23:23.560 --> 23:26.438
- I was surprised when you said yes.
- Yeah.

23:27.560 --> 23:31.553
This evening, back at your place...

23:32.680 --> 23:34.955
...the reason I was gone so Iong...

23:35.120 --> 23:37.680
...couldn't remember where I was.

23:37.840 --> 23:40.718
Eveythhing seemed the same.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.673
Well, you don't know
the neighbourhood.

23:46.360 --> 23:48.112
That ain't it.

23:50.360 --> 23:53.079
Last month, I was ploughing...

23:54.040 --> 23:56.759
...I couldn't find my way back
to the barn.

23:56.920 --> 23:59.593
Been working that same piece of Iand
for 20 years.

24:00.360 --> 24:02.828
If you've been feeling Iike this,
why didn't you come down and talk?

24:03.000 --> 24:04.274
That's what families are for.

24:04.640 --> 24:06.949
I've been scared
of that damn bus ride.

24:07.400 --> 24:11.996
I had this picture in my mind
of dying on that bus

24:12.160 --> 24:14.037
all by myself.

24:15.080 --> 24:16.672
I'm scared of that, bud.

24:17.880 --> 24:19.950
I never thought
you'd be scared of anything.

24:20.120 --> 24:22.315
Never was till now.

24:22.480 --> 24:24.391
You know, when I was a kid,
I used to have nightmares,

24:24.560 --> 24:26.710
and you used to tell me:

24:28.120 --> 24:30.839
"Being scared's a Iot worse
when you're all alone."

24:31.840 --> 24:33.432
I was right.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.511
You're not alone, Harry.

24:38.680 --> 24:40.477
Neither am I.

24:41.840 --> 24:44.991
It's just taken us an awful Iong time
to figure that out.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.433
AII right.

25:09.800 --> 25:12.712
Why are you doing this?
Just for the money?

25:12.880 --> 25:16.429
No, Fred, not just for the money.

25:16.600 --> 25:18.716
For the chance to work
with pros Iike you.

25:21.640 --> 25:24.757
Some of these gizmos Iook Iike
they're straight out of Flash Gordon.

25:24.920 --> 25:27.673
Oh, we passed Flash Gordon
a Iong time ago.

25:27.840 --> 25:29.478
What's that, a sonic blaster?

25:30.240 --> 25:31.593
EIectric razor.

25:31.760 --> 25:35.309
The head guy of the Iab gets
five o'clock shadow around noon.

25:37.240 --> 25:39.959
As Iong as you're going to the store,
would you pick up some cigars for me?

25:40.120 --> 25:41.269
- I'm all out.
- AII right.

25:41.440 --> 25:43.635
But I'm going to get you a new razor.

25:43.800 --> 25:46.872
And when you get back,
I'm gonna get you.

25:47.480 --> 25:50.392
- Ready?
- You drive careful, Jim.

25:50.560 --> 25:54.109
- Cats and dogs out there.
- See you in a bit.

25:58.080 --> 25:59.479
Harry?

26:01.040 --> 26:02.519
Harry?

26:03.160 --> 26:04.639
You with me?

26:04.800 --> 26:06.836
Yeah. Yeah.

26:20.320 --> 26:22.993
I'm not ready for that yet.

26:29.320 --> 26:31.993
Well, you've seen a Iot
of the Phoenix Foundation after all.

26:32.160 --> 26:36.119
Yeah, but if those guys think
I'm paying for the tour, they're crazy.

26:36.880 --> 26:39.474
Things Iike this happen to you
often?

26:39.640 --> 26:41.756
Yeah, as a matter of fact, they do.

26:41.920 --> 26:45.879
Hold that bar steady. Another wrap,
and we're out of here.

27:17.720 --> 27:20.598
Shorted the system.
The Iock is jammed.

27:20.760 --> 27:22.796
Rotten eggs.

27:24.200 --> 27:27.476
That's hydrogen sulfide.
That stuff will kill us.

27:27.640 --> 27:30.677
Come on, give me your scarf.
Harry, take off your coat.

27:31.200 --> 27:33.156
Put it over your nose
and breathe through it.

27:36.240 --> 27:37.639
Stand on these boxes.

27:37.800 --> 27:40.917
This gas is a Iot more concentrated
on the floor.

27:50.600 --> 27:53.160
I'm gonna need an electric current
to open that door.

27:54.760 --> 27:56.034
Light bulb.

27:56.440 --> 27:58.749
No, it'd take too Iong.

27:58.920 --> 28:00.273
There's too much rigging.

28:05.160 --> 28:08.596
Normally I wouldn't have
to tell anybody this,

28:08.760 --> 28:12.230
but stand very still.

28:12.400 --> 28:15.039
You mean, it could go off?

28:17.280 --> 28:19.111
I'm a statue.

28:30.320 --> 28:32.276
Is it armed now?

28:32.440 --> 28:34.032
And I thought you were new at this.

28:34.960 --> 28:36.439
I got them.

28:36.600 --> 28:37.999
MacGyver and the old man.

28:38.160 --> 28:40.037
Locked them in a room,
turned on the gas.

28:40.200 --> 28:42.031
And they should be dead by now.

28:42.200 --> 28:44.873
- They were alive when you Ieft them?
- Yeah. But--

28:45.040 --> 28:47.235
I want you to make sure
they're dead.

28:47.400 --> 28:49.231
- What about the bomb?
- Don't worry about it.

28:49.400 --> 28:52.278
I won't set it until after you confirm
the kill on MacGyver and the old man.

28:58.080 --> 29:01.356
I have to set the timer now.
Hand me that roll of cable.

29:12.600 --> 29:14.716
- What are you doing?
- Did you ever

29:14.880 --> 29:18.350
rub your feet on a carpet
and then zap somebody?

29:18.520 --> 29:20.317
That's about what I'm doing.

29:20.480 --> 29:22.755
That's all we need,
just one Iittle spark.

29:37.040 --> 29:38.917
Come on, Harry.

29:46.600 --> 29:47.828
I can't make it.

29:50.280 --> 29:53.192
- Come on, Harry. Wait for me in here.
- Oh, why there?

29:53.360 --> 29:56.033
Because you can't wait
out here in the hallway.

29:56.200 --> 29:58.998
Hopefully, they won't Iook for you
in here.

30:17.800 --> 30:19.711
I'II be back in a minute.

30:55.080 --> 30:56.274
There were two obstacles

30:56.440 --> 30:58.510
keeping Harry and me
from getting out of the building:

30:58.680 --> 31:02.468
The lock on the door
and the guard who put it there.

31:02.640 --> 31:04.631
Moving that New York lock
from my side of the door

31:04.800 --> 31:06.995
meant I had to make
an electrical device,

31:07.160 --> 31:09.435
one that had enough power
to slide the lock out of position.

31:09.840 --> 31:11.876
A pretty mechanical operation.

31:12.040 --> 31:14.190
As for getting rid of the guard,

31:14.360 --> 31:17.875
I figured that'd require
a more personal touch.

31:29.520 --> 31:32.910
When Ben Franklin stood out
in the storm with his kite and key,

31:33.080 --> 31:35.992
he probably didn't know how much
electricity was going to mean

31:36.160 --> 31:38.469
to future generations.

31:38.640 --> 31:40.437
I hoped Mr. Franklin's discovery

31:40.600 --> 31:44.275
was going to give me another shot
at my future.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.672
By running a current
from the batteries

31:46.840 --> 31:48.717
through the piece
of stainless steel,

31:48.880 --> 31:52.714
I wanted to rearrange the electrons
into neat little rows.

31:52.880 --> 31:54.677
If the voltage was strong enough,

31:54.840 --> 31:57.400
I'd have just what I needed
to move the lock:

31:57.960 --> 31:59.916
An electromagnet.

33:29.880 --> 33:32.269
- Look what I found.
- Where's MacGyver?

33:32.440 --> 33:34.192
He's getting out of here.

33:34.360 --> 33:35.554
Going for the police.

33:36.200 --> 33:38.760
Harry, isn't it?
Nice to see you again. Sit down.

33:43.200 --> 33:45.714
You mean, you're the one
behind all this?

33:46.320 --> 33:50.029
- I thought you worked here.
- Just for tonight.

33:50.200 --> 33:51.952
Tie him up.

33:54.680 --> 33:56.318
Harry?

33:57.080 --> 33:58.638
Harry?

34:05.080 --> 34:07.594
- Where's the kid?
- Don't worry about him.

34:07.760 --> 34:09.716
What are you talking about?

34:17.560 --> 34:19.471
Hey, what's the idea?

34:19.639 --> 34:21.391
My agreement with
the Liberation Front

34:21.560 --> 34:23.437
is that you're all expendable.

34:23.600 --> 34:26.512
Besides that, you annoy me.

34:37.560 --> 34:38.675
Mr. MacGyver?

34:39.159 --> 34:41.389
It seems that everything
I've heard about you is true.

34:41.560 --> 34:43.471
You are a very resourceful man.

34:43.639 --> 34:46.279
I admire that. However,

34:46.440 --> 34:49.398
I am going to activate the
Liberation Front's explosive device,

34:49.560 --> 34:51.869
and it will detonate in 1 5 minutes.

34:52.040 --> 34:55.271
I'm gonna leave the building now.
You're perfectly free to leave too.

34:55.440 --> 34:57.396
But I don't think you will.

34:57.560 --> 35:00.757
Because I have your grandfather
sitting on top of the bomb.

35:01.480 --> 35:03.630
Say hello to him, Harry.

35:04.600 --> 35:06.318
Get out of here, bud!

35:06.480 --> 35:08.118
See?

35:08.280 --> 35:10.396
I really do have him.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.719
And if I'm any judge
of human nature,

35:13.880 --> 35:17.429
you're gonna spend the Iast
1 5 minutes of your Iife Iooking for him.

35:18.120 --> 35:20.270
Goodbye, Mr. MacGyver.

35:29.680 --> 35:32.114
You must be out of your mind.

35:34.360 --> 35:36.555
You're just plain crazy!

35:38.680 --> 35:42.036
Goodbye to you too, Harry.

35:49.520 --> 35:51.670
Front-row seat, Harry.

36:11.480 --> 36:13.277
- Card-key access verified.
- Come on.

36:13.440 --> 36:16.000
- Voice identification, please.
- MacGyver.

36:20.640 --> 36:22.835
I knew if Harry and I
were gonna live long enough

36:23.000 --> 36:25.070
to see Wayne Gretzky
play hockey,

36:25.240 --> 36:27.356
I had to defuse that bomb.

36:27.960 --> 36:29.916
But first I had to find it.

36:30.080 --> 36:32.230
That didn't strike me
as too big a problem

36:32.400 --> 36:36.279
because the Phoenix Foundation
has an inventory file so detailed

36:36.440 --> 36:40.638
it can tell you how many paper clips
are in the eighth-floor supply room.

37:12.880 --> 37:15.553
I knew you'd try to access
the inventory files.

37:15.720 --> 37:18.393
That's because
I'm a very resourceful man.

37:18.560 --> 37:20.391
I thought you were Ieaving.

37:20.560 --> 37:22.949
Couldn't run the risk that you'd
find the device and disarm it.

37:23.120 --> 37:24.553
Oh, yeah, you think I could do that?

37:25.560 --> 37:27.516
Don't be modest.

37:28.240 --> 37:30.356
Everybody knows
MacGyver's MacGyver.

37:33.080 --> 37:35.150
So who are you?

37:35.320 --> 37:37.197
Victoria James.

37:37.360 --> 37:38.998
This week.

37:39.160 --> 37:40.912
You're probably aware
of some of my work.

37:41.240 --> 37:43.674
We're cut from the same cloth,
you and I.

37:43.840 --> 37:46.513
- Both professionals.
- Yeah, right.

37:46.680 --> 37:49.069
Well, this professional
doesn't take hostages.

37:49.240 --> 37:51.595
I needed Harry to make sure
you wouldn't Ieave the building.

37:51.760 --> 37:53.671
Well, I didn't,
so now you can Iet him go, right?

37:53.960 --> 37:55.154
Sorry.

37:55.320 --> 37:57.311
Nothing personal.

37:57.480 --> 37:58.674
Goodbye, MacGyver.

38:10.600 --> 38:12.909
- Give up?
- This is going to be a test.

38:13.080 --> 38:14.559
May the best person win.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.639
I really expected
much more of a fight, MacGyver.

38:31.480 --> 38:34.199
- Sorry to disappoint you.
- That's all right.

38:34.360 --> 38:35.918
I still enjoyed every minute of it.

38:36.440 --> 38:37.714
But I really have to go now.

39:03.080 --> 39:07.312
It's funny how when you want
time to move along, it never does.

39:07.800 --> 39:09.791
But when you're running
out of time,

39:09.960 --> 39:11.791
it disappears much too soon.

39:17.520 --> 39:19.715
I know, bud.

39:47.440 --> 39:49.556
Mr. Harry Jackson?

39:49.720 --> 39:50.914
Yes.

39:51.080 --> 39:54.595
Your wife, Celia Jackson,
son-in-Iaw, James MacGyver...

39:54.760 --> 39:56.079
What happened?

39:56.240 --> 39:58.356
I'm sorry to tell you, sir.

39:58.520 --> 40:01.273
There's been an accident.
Car went off the road,

40:01.440 --> 40:03.556
down into Miller's Creek.

40:04.400 --> 40:06.516
They both drowned.

40:07.840 --> 40:09.876
I'm real sorry.

40:25.480 --> 40:27.948
I'm not gonna Iose you too, Harry.

40:31.320 --> 40:32.912
Harry?

40:33.080 --> 40:35.150
I hope you can hear me.

40:35.320 --> 40:37.675
If you can, listen real carefully.

40:37.840 --> 40:39.558
We're gonna make it out of here.

40:39.720 --> 40:43.395
I'm on the eighth floor. I need you
to give me some kind of signal.

40:43.560 --> 40:46.358
We can still make the third period
of that hockey game.

40:46.520 --> 40:48.431
But I need a signal.

40:48.600 --> 40:50.750
Something, Harry.
Anything. Please.

40:54.640 --> 40:57.108
My chances of finding Harry
in this building

40:57.280 --> 41:01.512
were about as good as sneaking
into Fort Knox through the back door.

41:01.680 --> 41:05.070
Unless there was a back door
into that inventory file

41:05.240 --> 41:07.993
that Victoria hadn't erased.

41:22.840 --> 41:25.479
All the computers at Phoenix
have backup memories

41:25.640 --> 41:28.359
in case the primary data 's erased.

41:28.520 --> 41:31.398
I had to find that
backup inventory file.

41:46.520 --> 41:49.080
You really have to know
the Foundation's computer system

41:49.240 --> 41:51.708
in order to access a backup file.

41:51.880 --> 41:53.359
I was pretty sure Victoria didn't.

41:56.360 --> 41:58.476
I was wrong.

42:24.760 --> 42:26.432
Fifth floor. Gotcha, Harry.

42:38.480 --> 42:40.152
Harry?

42:40.920 --> 42:42.512
Harry?

42:47.560 --> 42:49.152
Harry!

42:53.400 --> 42:55.436
The bomb's set to go off
in a couple minutes. Let's go!

42:55.600 --> 42:58.239
We'd never get out of the building
in time. I gotta disarm it.

42:58.680 --> 43:00.272
Shot him without blinking an eye.

43:01.160 --> 43:03.276
Yeah, well, she's dead now.

43:03.440 --> 43:06.989
There are three microcircuit boards.
They prime the bomb.

43:07.440 --> 43:08.759
Can you take them out?

43:08.920 --> 43:10.990
They're integrated
into the triggering mechanism.

43:11.160 --> 43:14.232
If I try to disconnect them,
or even move this case, we are history.

43:14.400 --> 43:16.595
Tools. I need tools.

43:16.760 --> 43:20.116
Got a minute to go, bud.
Will you hurry?

43:23.160 --> 43:24.673
I gotta cut the wires,
break the connection

43:24.840 --> 43:26.273
between the trigger and the timer.

43:37.360 --> 43:39.237
I can't reach them.

43:39.680 --> 43:41.910
Just pry the top off. It's only plastic.

43:42.080 --> 43:43.559
Harry, there's a mercury switch
in there.

43:43.720 --> 43:45.119
Any sudden move will set it off.

43:47.960 --> 43:49.518
Twenty seconds!

43:49.680 --> 43:51.318
Oh, yeah.

43:59.360 --> 44:01.635
- Did you do it?
- I don't know.

44:14.320 --> 44:16.436
AII right!

44:18.040 --> 44:20.315
The way I figure it, if I can
make it through a night Iike this,

44:20.480 --> 44:22.675
- I must be in pretty good shape.
- Like I told you, Harry,

44:22.840 --> 44:24.432
you're gonna go on forever.

44:24.600 --> 44:28.115
I don't think so. But I'm gonna
make that hockey game.

44:28.280 --> 44:29.918
Harry!

44:42.240 --> 44:44.276
Are you sure you can't stay
a Iittle Ionger?

44:44.640 --> 44:47.916
- I gotta get back home.
- What's the rush?

44:48.080 --> 44:49.957
A Iot of things to do.

44:50.120 --> 44:51.758
I'm gonna fix that Ieak in the roof.

44:51.920 --> 44:54.514
It's gotta Iast me another 20 years.

45:03.240 --> 45:04.958
Another day.

45:05.520 --> 45:06.919
I still miss them.

45:07.520 --> 45:08.919
We always will.

45:11.160 --> 45:13.594
Here we go. Here we go.

45:15.840 --> 45:18.354
- Where you going?
- With you.

45:18.640 --> 45:19.675
What?

45:19.920 --> 45:23.799
Well, first of all, you packed
half my stuff in your suitcase.

45:23.960 --> 45:26.394
And I wanna spend some time
with my grandpa.
