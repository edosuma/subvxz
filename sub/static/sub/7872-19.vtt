WEBVTT

00:19.853 --> 00:22.054
Oh, for gloyvin' out loud.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.693
(exclaiming)

00:32.298 --> 00:34.366
(school bell ringing)

00:36.870 --> 00:37.970
(Barney belches)

00:37.972 --> 00:39.972
(whistle blows)

00:39.974 --> 00:42.875
(yells)

00:46.179 --> 00:47.579
(beeping)

00:52.819 --> 00:54.953
(playing harp solo)

00:55.989 --> 00:59.558
(playing harp solo)

00:59.560 --> 01:00.893
(tires screeching)

01:02.195 --> 01:03.662
D'oh!

01:03.664 --> 01:04.730
(tires screeching)

01:04.732 --> 01:06.398
(grunts)

01:10.503 --> 01:13.238
Well, this is
a no-brainer.

01:14.240 --> 01:16.575
(whoops)

01:17.911 --> 01:19.578
D'oh!

01:20.914 --> 01:22.614
D'oh!

01:23.850 --> 01:25.284
D'oh!

01:26.352 --> 01:28.087
D'oh!

01:30.023 --> 01:31.390
D'oh!

01:31.392 --> 01:32.858
D'oh!

01:32.860 --> 01:34.359
D'oh!

01:34.361 --> 01:36.395
D'oh!

01:36.397 --> 01:37.396
D'oh!

01:37.398 --> 01:38.931
D'oh!

01:42.869 --> 01:44.036
(groans)

01:44.038 --> 01:45.204
Now what?

01:45.206 --> 01:47.106
(screams)

01:56.049 --> 01:57.549
(sighs)

01:57.551 --> 01:59.384
Well, I better get going.

01:59.386 --> 02:01.220
Should I just put that
on your tab?

02:01.222 --> 02:02.754
No, I'll pay off my bill.

02:02.756 --> 02:04.223
Hmm?

02:04.225 --> 02:05.557
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

02:05.559 --> 02:06.892
Someone's actually paying?

02:06.894 --> 02:10.395
Now let me see if I remember
how to open this thing.

02:10.397 --> 02:12.064
Some kind of button or knob.

02:12.066 --> 02:13.098
(bell dings)

02:13.100 --> 02:15.434
So that's what that noise means.

02:15.436 --> 02:16.602
Just take your stupid money.

02:16.604 --> 02:18.070
Huh?

02:18.072 --> 02:21.406
Hey, this jacket's
full of old stuff.

02:21.408 --> 02:23.509
I knew I wasn't getting
my money.

02:24.410 --> 02:26.044
Hey.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.647
D'oh!

02:29.749 --> 02:31.083
Losers.

02:31.085 --> 02:32.751
What the...?

02:32.753 --> 02:35.187
Oh.

02:36.589 --> 02:38.090
Ooh!

02:38.092 --> 02:40.092
Here's a roll of film
I never developed.

02:40.094 --> 02:41.260
Well, too late for that.

02:41.262 --> 02:43.095
All those
photo developing joints

02:43.097 --> 02:46.165
are either knocked down or have
been turned into deer blinds.

02:57.777 --> 02:59.111
Eh, listen, Homer.

02:59.113 --> 03:00.779
Uh, I can develop this for you.

03:00.781 --> 03:02.781
Yeah, this bar is so poorly lit,

03:02.783 --> 03:04.850
it's legally a darkroom.

03:04.852 --> 03:07.352
Mmm... mmm.

03:07.354 --> 03:08.520
And the best part is,

03:08.522 --> 03:10.622
Duff is
chemically indistinguishable

03:10.624 --> 03:12.191
from developing fluid.

03:12.193 --> 03:13.992
Way to go, Duff!

03:13.994 --> 03:15.961
I'm developing quite a thirst.

03:15.963 --> 03:18.363
Now, there's an
eight-by-ten I can enjoy.

03:24.137 --> 03:25.637
(squeals)

03:29.042 --> 03:30.509
Here you go, Midge.

03:30.511 --> 03:32.711
I played with the colors
and changed the lighting,

03:32.713 --> 03:35.347
but I could only make your kids
so cute and no cuter.

03:35.349 --> 03:36.682
This is so exciting.

03:36.684 --> 03:38.317
It's like a sneak peek

03:38.319 --> 03:41.386
into the long-forgotten
world of six years ago.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.021
Yeah, well, beware.

03:43.023 --> 03:45.023
These pictures show
that six years ago,

03:45.025 --> 03:46.325
Bart and Lisa were fighting

03:46.327 --> 03:48.360
like creationists
and common sense.

03:48.362 --> 03:49.661
(gasp)

03:49.663 --> 03:51.330
Hey, photos don't lie,
my friend.

03:51.332 --> 03:53.031
(worried groaning)

03:53.033 --> 03:54.499
Would you like
a matte finish?

03:54.501 --> 03:55.734
Sure.

03:55.736 --> 03:58.170
(Moe chuckles)

03:58.172 --> 04:00.239
There you go.

04:01.574 --> 04:05.010
♪ And I know if I don't

04:05.012 --> 04:08.914
♪ I'll go out of my mind

04:08.916 --> 04:12.017
♪ Better leave her behind

04:12.019 --> 04:15.721
♪ With the kids,
they're all right ♪

04:15.723 --> 04:19.191
♪ The kids are all right

04:19.193 --> 04:21.727
♪ The kids
are all right. ♪

04:21.729 --> 04:23.729
Homer, you shot
all these pictures.

04:23.731 --> 04:25.530
Why didn't you step in?

04:25.532 --> 04:27.366
The light was
so good, Marge.

04:27.368 --> 04:29.034
It was like Florence in May.

04:29.036 --> 04:30.702
I don't get it.

04:30.704 --> 04:33.605
How come I was always fighting
with Señorita Stupid?

04:33.607 --> 04:34.606
(groans)

04:34.608 --> 04:36.041
Don't waste beer.

04:36.043 --> 04:37.376
And how did we reach

04:37.378 --> 04:39.544
the uneasy alliance
we enjoy today?

04:39.546 --> 04:41.280
Well, it's quite a story.

04:41.282 --> 04:45.250
A story of a special bond
between a brother and a sister.

04:45.252 --> 04:47.386
I'd say our story
is a tragedy.

04:47.388 --> 04:48.920
Like the <i>Planet of the Apes.</i>

04:48.922 --> 04:51.390
The tragedy being they can never
stop making them.

04:51.392 --> 04:53.058
Hey, come on.

04:53.060 --> 04:55.227
The first and eighth movies
were pretty darn good.

04:55.229 --> 04:57.562
Now, as for you kids,

04:57.564 --> 04:59.765
<i>it all began six years ago.</i>

04:59.767 --> 05:02.734
<i>The president of back then</i>
<i>was the president.</i>

05:02.736 --> 05:04.736
<i>The popular music</i>
<i>of those times</i>

05:04.738 --> 05:06.405
<i>was all the rage.</i>

05:06.407 --> 05:09.141
<i>Wherever we went,</i>
<i>you kids fought.</i>

05:09.143 --> 05:12.244
"Penny the Penguin wanted
to go to the North Pole.

05:12.246 --> 05:15.414
Wally the Walrus wanted
to go to the South Pole."

05:15.416 --> 05:18.950
I guess you could say
they were "polar opposites."

05:18.952 --> 05:20.452
(groans)

05:20.454 --> 05:22.921
You see, they're polar opp...
I get it.

05:22.923 --> 05:25.123
It's just not funny.
You know what's funny?

05:25.125 --> 05:26.458
This.

05:26.460 --> 05:27.759
<i>Goodnight Moon?</i>

05:27.761 --> 05:29.094
Good night, Bart!

05:29.096 --> 05:32.597
(grunting)

05:32.599 --> 05:35.267
(groans) Did I hear someone
whispering hush?

05:35.269 --> 05:36.935
(worried groaning)

05:36.937 --> 05:40.005
(whispering):
I want you to get out.

05:41.474 --> 05:43.275
And stay out!

05:43.277 --> 05:44.810
(whispering):
Thank you.

05:44.812 --> 05:46.945
So that's why
we started going

05:46.947 --> 05:48.613
to story time at
the Kwik-E-Mart.

05:48.615 --> 05:52.617
Remember when Apu let Dad
have the expired hot dogs?

05:52.619 --> 05:56.855
(groans) Just once, and I'm
still taking medication for it.

05:56.857 --> 06:00.459
(groans) So many photos
of you kids fighting.

06:00.461 --> 06:02.794
That's why we
never developed that roll.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.863
What? Back to that story?

06:06.165 --> 06:09.534
Why can't you just relax
and be nice to your sister?

06:09.536 --> 06:11.370
My bed scares me.

06:11.372 --> 06:12.704
That's ridiculous.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.673
Now, just close your eyes

06:14.675 --> 06:16.141
and nuzzle in

06:16.143 --> 06:18.777
under the big clown fangs.

06:19.979 --> 06:22.748
Attaboy.
Sweet dreams.

06:26.886 --> 06:28.653
She took my pencil.

06:28.655 --> 06:30.489
Lisa, there are plenty
of mini golf pencils

06:30.491 --> 06:31.990
in the kitchen drawer.

06:31.992 --> 06:35.994
Tell Bart, because it's
my pencil and he stole it!

06:35.996 --> 06:38.330
(grunts) Starfish head!

06:38.332 --> 06:41.233
I can write your name
better than you.

06:41.235 --> 06:43.735
(humming)

06:43.737 --> 06:46.338
(groans)

06:46.340 --> 06:47.539
(over speaker): A.
Ow!

06:47.541 --> 06:48.507
E.
Ow!

06:48.509 --> 06:49.574
I.
Ow!

06:49.576 --> 06:51.510
O.
You jerk!

06:51.512 --> 06:52.677
Ow!

06:52.679 --> 06:54.346
Why, you little...

06:54.348 --> 06:57.082
("Also Sprach Zarathustra"
playing)

07:14.200 --> 07:16.268
(angry groaning)
(choking)

07:19.205 --> 07:21.206
(chuckles)

07:21.208 --> 07:24.276
Where is he learning
this violence?

07:24.278 --> 07:25.844
(sighs)

07:34.220 --> 07:38.123
Things got so bad between Bart
and Lisa, I was losing sleep.

07:40.893 --> 07:42.928
(gasping) Homer.

07:42.930 --> 07:44.763
Homer, I just had
the worst dream.

07:44.765 --> 07:47.566
I lost one of the kids
at the World's Fair.

07:47.568 --> 07:49.568
It's okay. Which one?

07:49.570 --> 07:50.936
Brisbane '88.

07:50.938 --> 07:53.572
(gasps)
That's so horrible, baby.

07:53.574 --> 07:55.240
I know, I know.

07:55.242 --> 07:56.408
Now, don't worry.

07:56.410 --> 07:58.243
They're right here
in the bed.

07:58.245 --> 08:00.312
(sleepy grunting)

08:01.747 --> 08:03.748
We have to find some answers.

08:03.750 --> 08:05.083
(scoffs)
Answers.

08:05.085 --> 08:07.319
That's your answer
for everything.

08:09.622 --> 08:13.425
My findings are that one of
your children is smart and good,

08:13.427 --> 08:16.261
and the other
is dim and evil.

08:16.263 --> 08:18.430
Professionally,
I'm not permitted

08:18.432 --> 08:20.131
to say which is which.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.433
Is it the boy?

08:21.435 --> 08:23.935
I told you, I can't say.

08:23.937 --> 08:25.770
BART:
What did that say?

08:25.772 --> 08:28.440
We're done here.
Not so fast.

08:28.442 --> 08:30.609
We have 40 minutes left.

08:30.611 --> 08:34.346
All right,
we'll do a trust exercise.

08:34.348 --> 08:36.248
Shut your eyes.

08:40.453 --> 08:42.120
What are we going to do?

08:42.122 --> 08:44.289
It's not so bad, sweetie.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.858
I took a box of Altoids
from her waiting room.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.794
The most anyone has ever
gotten out of therapy.

08:49.796 --> 08:51.997
(groaning)

08:51.999 --> 08:53.798
(grunting)

08:53.800 --> 08:55.033
Watch it!

08:55.035 --> 08:56.368
Trying to mow.

08:56.370 --> 08:58.003
The city's making
me do this.

08:58.005 --> 08:59.638
Hey, neighboreeno.
(groans)

08:59.640 --> 09:01.306
Maude and I know
how hard it is

09:01.308 --> 09:03.642
to be dealt
a pair of little jokers.

09:03.644 --> 09:07.178
Daddy, may we please go tuck
ourselves in for naps now?

09:07.180 --> 09:09.814
Now, you know you can't tuck
yourselves in till you're 18.

09:09.816 --> 09:11.316
Go get Mommy.

09:11.318 --> 09:12.884
(humming happily)

09:12.886 --> 09:14.686
I'm sorry you had
to witness that.

09:14.688 --> 09:15.887
Me, too.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.355
Anyway, Maude
and I thought

09:17.357 --> 09:18.723
you'd like to hang
out with adults

09:18.725 --> 09:20.225
and have some mature
conversatiaroonies,

09:20.227 --> 09:21.893
so we'd like to
take you to brunch.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.662
Brunch? I wish.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.897
Can't get a sitter
'cause our kids are nuts,

09:25.899 --> 09:28.099
and no kennel will take them.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.671
Now, sir,
don't you waffle on that brunch.

09:32.673 --> 09:34.172
Grandma Flanders can
watch the kids.

09:34.174 --> 09:35.540
Hello, Joe.

09:35.542 --> 09:36.841
Doesn't know who I am...

09:36.843 --> 09:38.343
has trouble moving...

09:38.345 --> 09:40.412
I'd say we have
ourselves babysitter.

09:40.414 --> 09:42.080
I just turned a hundred.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.515
Eight bucks an hour.

09:43.517 --> 09:45.383
I can't hear you.

09:45.385 --> 09:48.086
I said seven bucks!

09:50.523 --> 09:54.225
(over speaker): "Woe to you,
scribes, Pharisees, hypocrites.

09:54.227 --> 09:56.695
For you tithe mint
and dill and cumin."

09:56.697 --> 09:59.431
Todd, I like how gentle
you are with that toy.

09:59.433 --> 10:01.099
Enough nonsense.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.034
It's time for prayers.

10:03.036 --> 10:04.869
I don't know any prayers.

10:04.871 --> 10:06.871
Is "hell's bells" a prayer?

10:06.873 --> 10:08.607
'Cause Daddy says it
all the time.

10:08.609 --> 10:11.543
(screaming)

10:11.545 --> 10:13.111
(Homer humming)

10:13.113 --> 10:14.713
Woop...

10:14.715 --> 10:18.283
and woop... and...

10:18.285 --> 10:20.452
ziperoo.
(moaning)

10:20.454 --> 10:24.055
I never said this before,
but the food can wait.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.724
(gasps) What do you mean?

10:25.726 --> 10:27.726
Let's role- play.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.227
Okay, but fast.

10:29.229 --> 10:30.729
Um, um, got it.

10:30.731 --> 10:32.397
Uh, me: seagull.

10:32.399 --> 10:34.733
You: boardwalk trash can.

10:34.735 --> 10:35.900
Ooh!

10:35.902 --> 10:37.802
(cawing)

10:42.475 --> 10:45.477
Well, isn't this a great
chance to drink more water?

10:45.479 --> 10:47.312
My bladder's
going to burst.

10:47.314 --> 10:49.414
I know you've had a
few too many waters,

10:49.416 --> 10:51.983
but that is no reason
for the sailor talk.

10:53.252 --> 10:55.253
She's awfully quiet.

10:55.255 --> 10:57.756
Her body usually

10:57.758 --> 11:00.158

wakes my grandpa up.

11:03.596 --> 11:05.930

11:05.932 --> 11:07.432
(continue screaming)

11:07.434 --> 11:09.434
HOMER:
♪ Another bride

11:09.436 --> 11:10.969
♪ Another June

11:10.971 --> 11:13.938
MARGE:
♪ Another sunny honeymoon

11:13.940 --> 11:15.774

11:15.776 --> 11:17.509

11:17.511 --> 11:19.344

11:19.346 --> 11:20.779

11:20.781 --> 11:22.614
They're never that happy
when we're around.

11:24.618 --> 11:26.584
BOTH:
Ice cream truck!

11:32.024 --> 11:34.859
Mmm, that was
wonderful.

11:34.861 --> 11:37.462
My favorite kind
of weekend morning.

11:37.464 --> 11:41.466
A sexy snuggle while our rotten
kids are someone else's problem.

11:41.468 --> 11:43.535
(laughs)

11:45.304 --> 11:48.306
(laughs harder)

11:48.308 --> 11:50.375
(gasping laughs)

11:56.015 --> 11:57.849
Bart, those are
strangers.

11:57.851 --> 12:00.318
You're right, let's
go where it's safe.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.753
(horn honks)
MAN: Watch it!

12:08.160 --> 12:10.161

12:10.163 --> 12:12.363
Faster, faster.

12:12.365 --> 12:14.365
Your brother
is stupid.

12:14.367 --> 12:16.367
Bye-bye.

12:16.369 --> 12:19.204
♪ The wheel I'm inside
goes round and round ♪

12:19.206 --> 12:21.806
♪ Round and round,
round and round ♪

12:24.510 --> 12:27.078
♪ The boat I'm on board
goes up and down ♪

12:27.080 --> 12:29.080
♪ Up and down, up and down...

12:35.221 --> 12:37.889
Thank you for a
wonderful brunch.

12:37.891 --> 12:39.891
I don't know
what I liked more--

12:39.893 --> 12:42.861
the personalized omelets
or the light jazz combo.

12:42.863 --> 12:46.698
I liked when the trumpet
player's cheeks got really big.

12:46.700 --> 12:48.099
That's good music.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.100
(Ned gasps)

12:49.102 --> 12:50.535
(screams)

12:50.537 --> 12:52.604
Grandma Flanders
has passed.

12:52.606 --> 12:55.440
Where are <i>our</i> kids?
Gone.

12:55.442 --> 12:58.276
Looks like once Grandma turned
to dust, they took a powder.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.878
Sorry if that seems
a little flip.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.379
(hyperventilating):
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

13:01.381 --> 13:02.947
Don't worry, sweetie.

13:02.949 --> 13:05.383
We'll call the local police,
and they'll find our kids.

13:05.385 --> 13:06.885
We never used
them till now,

13:06.887 --> 13:08.887
but I'm sure they're
highly competent.

13:08.889 --> 13:12.724
Gunderson, before we hire
you, one final test.

13:12.726 --> 13:14.726
Can you get these
handcuffs off of me?

13:14.728 --> 13:18.062
Uh, might seem like a one-time
situation, but it's not.

13:18.064 --> 13:20.298
(telephone rings)

13:22.568 --> 13:24.569
Hey, you know,
I used to represent

13:24.571 --> 13:26.571
Silver Star
Police Supplies.

13:26.573 --> 13:29.407
Then they gave my territory
to the owner's nephew.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.810
And they wonder why
they lost Jackson City.

13:31.812 --> 13:33.812
I was Jackson City!

13:33.814 --> 13:35.547
Yeah, focus on
the cuffs, please.

13:39.084 --> 13:40.251
Well, well.

13:40.253 --> 13:42.320
Look who's burning plastic.

13:43.923 --> 13:45.924
It's mine. Give it back.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.926
Looks like someone
hasn't learned--

13:47.928 --> 13:49.928
you don't argue
with bullies.

13:49.930 --> 13:53.264
Thank goodness I have
a teaching fist.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.934
(laughing)

13:55.936 --> 13:59.370
(Lisa crying)

14:01.273 --> 14:02.707
What's her problem?

14:04.276 --> 14:07.779
Please, don't hurt my brother.

14:07.781 --> 14:09.948
Aw, come on.
Don't cry.

14:09.950 --> 14:13.284
This is why I'm so nervous
about becoming a dad.

14:13.286 --> 14:15.119
(snorts, cries)

14:15.121 --> 14:17.188
I'm crying
out my nose.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.691
(snorts, cries)

14:21.126 --> 14:23.127
Fine, you babies
can go.

14:23.129 --> 14:25.129
Let's go over
to Mommy & Me

14:25.131 --> 14:28.733
and cut holes in the parachute
so it doesn't billow properly.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.002
(laughs)
Baby!

14:31.004 --> 14:32.470
All right, let's move.

14:32.472 --> 14:33.838
Why aren't you crying?

14:33.840 --> 14:35.974
I was pretending,
and it worked.

14:35.976 --> 14:37.542
Hmm.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.978
You know, kid,
with your smarts and my Barts,

14:39.980 --> 14:41.646
we make a good team.

14:41.648 --> 14:43.014
What are "Barts"?

14:43.016 --> 14:44.515
You're the smart one,
you figure it out.

14:44.517 --> 14:46.484
(nervous groaning)

14:46.486 --> 14:48.753
I sure hope this book is right.

14:50.155 --> 14:51.189
(door opens)

14:51.191 --> 14:52.824
HOMER:
Marge, I'm back.

14:52.826 --> 14:54.659
Sorry, nothing.

14:54.661 --> 14:57.362
But if we have a third kid,
we should call her Maggie.

14:57.364 --> 14:58.730
Why Maggie?

14:58.732 --> 15:00.565
It's a good name
if we lose her.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.567
Maggie? Maggie?

15:02.569 --> 15:04.235
Going back out.

15:05.571 --> 15:07.071
Maggie?

15:08.741 --> 15:12.577
All right, I'm turning to a
desperate mother's last resort.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.581
(sighs)

15:16.583 --> 15:18.416
I hope it works.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.051
Psychic hotline.

15:20.053 --> 15:22.053
Selma? You're
a psychic now?

15:22.055 --> 15:23.888
I'm filling in
for a friend.

15:23.890 --> 15:25.356
She got hit by a car.

15:25.358 --> 15:26.925
Never saw it coming.

15:26.927 --> 15:28.192
(groans)

15:28.194 --> 15:30.194
I'll never see
my kids again.

15:30.196 --> 15:32.030
I'm sensing...

15:32.032 --> 15:33.364
it's all your
husband's fault.

15:33.366 --> 15:35.199
That'll be $20.

15:35.201 --> 15:36.834
(groans)

15:38.604 --> 15:40.371
I know this place.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.440
It's where Grampa and his
friends the monsters live.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.542
(creepy moaning)

15:44.544 --> 15:46.044
(moans)

15:46.046 --> 15:47.545
I want to pinch 'em.

15:47.547 --> 15:50.882
Teach me how
to use my phone.

15:50.884 --> 15:54.385
Stay away from my grandchildren,
you love-sucking ghouls.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.220
(moaning like zombies)

15:56.222 --> 15:58.222

15:58.224 --> 16:00.224
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

16:00.226 --> 16:02.560
I made it out of clay.

16:02.562 --> 16:04.095
(moans)

16:04.097 --> 16:05.897
Where did you go?

16:05.899 --> 16:08.566
Now, you have
some candy,

16:08.568 --> 16:11.970
while I tell the nurses
station to go get your folks.

16:15.407 --> 16:17.608
(snoring)

16:17.610 --> 16:19.978
I guess you should
be in charge, Lisa.

16:19.980 --> 16:21.412
You'll always
be half my age,

16:21.414 --> 16:23.247
but you'll always
be smarter than me.

16:23.249 --> 16:26.084
Don't worry, Bart, you'll
always think you're in charge,

16:26.086 --> 16:27.919
even though I
secretly will be.

16:27.921 --> 16:29.153
Thank you.

16:30.589 --> 16:32.590
Okay. Listen up,
you childless losers.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.592
I need you to help me
find my kids.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.995
Any of these them?
Hmm?

16:38.597 --> 16:39.931
Uh... no.

16:39.933 --> 16:41.432
Sorry, kids.

16:41.434 --> 16:42.934
I'll place you
with your parents,

16:42.936 --> 16:46.104
but for now, go back to making
those little drink umbrellas.

16:46.106 --> 16:47.939
CARL: Homer, we'll
definitely help you,

16:47.941 --> 16:49.273
but, uh, you're gonna
have to wait.

16:49.275 --> 16:50.875
We just ordered a pie
for the bar.

16:53.445 --> 16:55.279
What'd you do
that for?

16:55.281 --> 16:58.683
Yeah, it took us 45 minutes
to choose a topping.

16:58.685 --> 17:01.019
We decided on cheese.

17:05.991 --> 17:06.991
Twice!

17:06.993 --> 17:08.826
A new record.

17:08.828 --> 17:10.828
We're lost.
Can you help us?

17:10.830 --> 17:13.197
I'll tell my dad
about you right now.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.666
Dad! Dad! Dad!

17:15.668 --> 17:17.702
Cartoons.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.504
Milhouse,
keep it down.

17:19.506 --> 17:21.639
I got to finish
these tax returns.

17:21.641 --> 17:23.207
Ooh, cartoons.

17:23.209 --> 17:25.043
(suspenseful music,
cat yowls)

17:25.045 --> 17:26.911

17:28.814 --> 17:30.848
Whoa! Big dog! Big dog!

17:34.654 --> 17:36.721

Once, I read a book
called <i>Jack and Jill.</i>

17:38.825 --> 17:40.858
They went down a hill.

17:40.860 --> 17:42.360
And broke their
crowns...!

17:42.362 --> 17:43.861
Good thing we don't have crowns.

17:43.863 --> 17:46.064
"Crown" means head!

17:54.540 --> 17:56.674
Ta-da! I saved you!

17:56.676 --> 17:58.676
Ugh! But you
pushed me!

17:58.678 --> 18:01.512
Duh. I couldn't save you
until I pushed you.

18:01.514 --> 18:03.347
Girls make no sense!

18:03.349 --> 18:04.849
Anyway, we're even-steven.

18:04.851 --> 18:06.851
I just don't want
to fight anymore.

18:06.853 --> 18:09.220
Okay. But it was always
your fault.
Fine.

18:09.222 --> 18:10.721
'Cause you're a jerk.

18:10.723 --> 18:13.091
