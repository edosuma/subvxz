IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:07.775 --> 00:11.579
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:11.612 --> 00:14.115
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:14.148 --> 00:16.084
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:16.117 --> 00:17.351
ARE MEMBERS OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:17.385 --> 00:19.487
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.655
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:22.790 --> 00:23.791
- SO WHAT'D YOU THINK?

00:23.824 --> 00:25.159
- WELL, MAYBE
THERE'S A REASON

00:25.193 --> 00:26.360
THEY DON'T MAKE
SILENT MOVIES ANYMORE.

00:26.394 --> 00:27.128
- OH, OKAY.

00:27.161 --> 00:30.398
NEXT TIME
YOU PICK THE MOVIE.

00:30.431 --> 00:32.466
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:32.500 --> 00:34.468
- DON'T WORRY,
NOBODY WE WORK WITH

00:34.502 --> 00:37.571
COULD SIT THROUGH TWO HOURS
OF BLACK AND WHITE NO TALKING.

00:37.605 --> 00:40.274
- I THINK I'M A LITTLE
CONFUSED BY THE RULES.

00:40.308 --> 00:43.411
- WELL, OFFICIALLY,
IF THIS WORKS

00:43.444 --> 00:45.379
WE JUST NEED TO DISCLOSE
OUR INVOLVEMENT.

00:45.413 --> 00:46.514
- DISCLOSE?

00:46.547 --> 00:48.249
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN,
SEND OUT A MEMO?

00:48.282 --> 00:49.617
- BASICALLY, YEAH,
TWO OF THEM,

00:49.650 --> 00:51.752
ONE TO YOUR BOSS,
ONE TO MINE.

00:51.785 --> 00:54.122
- I DON'T KNOW
IF I'M READY FOR THAT.

00:54.155 --> 00:57.358
- WELL, LET'S TAKE
SOME TIME THEN, BACK OFF,

00:57.391 --> 00:59.393
TAKE SOME OF THE PRESSURE OFF,
YOU KNOW?

00:59.427 --> 01:01.295
- SOUNDS GOOD.

01:01.329 --> 01:04.332
- HEY, THERE'S A GREAT BISTRO
DOWN THE STREET.

01:04.365 --> 01:07.768
YOU WANNA
GET SOMETHING TO EAT?

01:07.801 --> 01:10.838
- HOW 'BOUT WE GO BACK
TO MY PLACE AND DO TAKEOUT?

01:10.871 --> 01:12.373
- I LIKE IT.

01:12.406 --> 01:16.244
- [laughs]
- A LOT.

01:16.277 --> 01:17.411
[dog barks]

01:17.445 --> 01:18.746
- COME ON.

01:18.779 --> 01:21.382
ORION, STAY.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.251
GOOD BOY.

01:27.288 --> 01:30.491
NO CREDIT CARDS.
MY WIFE LOOKS AT THE STATEMENTS.

01:30.524 --> 01:33.394
I'LL GIVE HER CASH UP FRONT.

01:33.427 --> 01:36.464
HAVE HER WAIT FOR ME
AT 14TH AND 7TH.

01:36.497 --> 01:39.700
STARBUCKS.
9:00 P.M.

01:39.733 --> 01:42.503
- 9:00 P.M.?
YEAH, I CAN DO IT.

01:42.536 --> 01:44.505
OKAY, SO LET ME GET DRESSED.

01:44.538 --> 01:46.474
BYE.
[phone beeps]

01:48.342 --> 01:51.145
- YOU'RE GOING OUT?
WHAT IF I HAD PLANS?

01:51.179 --> 01:53.347
- MOM, I CAN'T TURN DOWN
CATERING STUFF.

01:53.381 --> 01:55.616
THEY'LL START CALLING
OTHER PEOPLE.

01:55.649 --> 01:58.486
- CATERING?
WHO HAS DINNER THIS LATE?

01:58.519 --> 01:59.853
- RICH PEOPLE.

01:59.887 --> 02:01.789
- GOOD. MAYBE
YOU'LL MEET SOMEONE.

02:01.822 --> 02:03.324
[door closes]

02:03.357 --> 02:05.859
- ALL YOU HAD WAS SALAD.

02:05.893 --> 02:08.296
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T
WANT ANYTHING ELSE?

02:08.329 --> 02:10.298
- THIS IS GREAT, BREWSTER.

02:10.331 --> 02:12.733
MOST GUYS WANT
THE GIRLFRIEND EXPERIENCE,

02:12.766 --> 02:14.802
BUT ONLY IN BED.

02:14.835 --> 02:16.604
- THE CHASE IS HALF THE FUN.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.639
- [giggles]
- GET A STEAK.

02:18.672 --> 02:20.941
A WOMAN NEEDS MEET ON HER BONES
TO SURVIVE THESE WINTERS.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.477
- WINTER, I STAY INSIDE.

02:23.511 --> 02:24.812
- I LIKE TO BE OUT.

02:24.845 --> 02:27.848
WALKING THE BEACH,
CLIMBING MOUNTAINS.

02:27.881 --> 02:29.717
THE COLD,
YOU GET USED TO IT.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.519
- OOH, NOT ME.

02:31.552 --> 02:32.786
- YOU ALL DONE, SIR?

02:32.820 --> 02:35.789
- WRAP THAT UP
FOR MY DOG, PLEASE.

02:36.924 --> 02:39.527
WELL, HERE WE GO.

02:39.560 --> 02:42.230
IT'S NOT A SPORTS CAR,
BUT IT'S NOT A BEATER EITHER.

02:42.263 --> 02:43.264
- GREAT.

02:43.297 --> 02:45.399
- GETS THE JOB DONE.

02:47.901 --> 02:49.270
HERE YOU ARE.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.941
OH...HA.
IT'S ORION.

02:53.974 --> 02:56.344
ORION DOESN'T BITE.

02:56.377 --> 02:58.212
- I DON'T USUALLY
GET IN CARS.

02:58.246 --> 03:01.549
- YOU'RE NOT SCARED,
ARE YOU?

03:03.016 --> 03:04.952
- HEY.

03:04.985 --> 03:06.687
HE'S BEEN IN HERE
THE WHOLE TIME?

03:06.720 --> 03:08.389
- YEAH, HE LIKES IT.

03:08.422 --> 03:10.724
I TELL HIM
HE'S GUARDING THE CAR.

03:18.732 --> 03:21.535
- SEE ANYTHING ELSE?

03:21.569 --> 03:23.937
- YEAH, I DO.

03:29.477 --> 03:31.579
- IS THAT WHAT YOU MEANT
BY TAKING IT SLOW

03:31.612 --> 03:35.549
AND TAKING THE PRESSURE OFF?

03:35.583 --> 03:37.285
- WHAT'S WRONG?

03:38.952 --> 03:41.755
- NOTHING'S WRONG.
I'M--I'M, UH--THIS IS--

03:41.789 --> 03:44.525
- LISTEN, HEY.

03:44.558 --> 03:47.928
I UNDERSTAND

03:47.961 --> 03:52.400
THIS IS REALLY HARD FOR YOU.

03:52.433 --> 03:54.668
BUT WHATEVER IT IS,

03:54.702 --> 03:56.737
I CAN HANDLE IT.

03:56.770 --> 04:00.374
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE, OKAY?

04:02.643 --> 04:04.412
- OKAY.

04:04.445 --> 04:07.315
- SO COME HERE.

04:31.472 --> 04:33.841
- PLEASE.

04:33.874 --> 04:36.377
PLEASE,
I'LL DO ANYTHING.

04:36.410 --> 04:39.347
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY ME.

04:39.380 --> 04:43.984
[sobbing]
I'LL DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

04:44.017 --> 04:45.386
PLEASE.

04:47.988 --> 04:50.658
I DON'T WANNA DIE.

04:53.427 --> 04:55.563
- NOW, THAT'S UP TO YOU.

04:55.596 --> 04:57.931
ISN'T IT?

04:57.965 --> 04:59.967
- [sobs]

05:07.475 --> 05:10.444
[dramatic music]

05:10.478 --> 05:18.486
*

05:58.959 --> 06:00.694
[telephone rings]

06:00.728 --> 06:03.797
- OH...

06:03.831 --> 06:05.699
[ringing]

06:09.503 --> 06:11.872
- AHH...

06:11.905 --> 06:14.141
MY CAPTAIN.

06:14.174 --> 06:15.509
MM.

06:19.079 --> 06:20.781
- WELL, I...I GUESS

06:20.814 --> 06:23.951
OUR WEEKEND HAD TO END
SOMETIME.

06:29.957 --> 06:32.092
- HEY, SORRY.
- HAVE A GOOD WEEKEND?

06:32.125 --> 06:35.796
- UH, YEAH, YEAH.
ERRANDS...

06:35.829 --> 06:37.865
- GOOD FOR YOU.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.032
- WHAT?

06:39.066 --> 06:42.970
- IT'S NICE
TO SEE YOU LOOK HAPPY.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.038
- WHAT DO WE GOT?

06:45.072 --> 06:47.475
- A MISSING
16-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

06:47.508 --> 06:50.944
TWO DAYS GONE.
[knocks at door]

06:50.978 --> 06:54.047
- MOM, I'M--I'M SORRY.

06:54.081 --> 06:58.786
I'M SO SORRY.
I'M A BAD GIRL.

06:58.819 --> 07:01.822
I GO OUT WITH--
[screams]

07:01.855 --> 07:05.726
I HAVE SEX WITH MEN.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.895
FOR MONEY.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.998
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT'S WHO I REALLY AM,

07:11.031 --> 07:14.568
JUST A DIRTY WHORE.

07:14.602 --> 07:15.669
[click]

07:15.703 --> 07:17.938
- MY HALEY'S A GOOD GIRL.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.807
SOMEONE MADE HER SAY THAT.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.543
- WHEN IS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW HALEY?

07:22.576 --> 07:23.977
- SATURDAY NIGHT.

07:24.011 --> 07:25.813
SHE HAD A LAST-MINUTE
CATERING JOB,

07:25.846 --> 07:27.948
LEFT AT 8:30.

07:27.981 --> 07:29.817
HASN'T BEEN HOME SINCE.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.819
- AND YOU WAIT
TILL MONDAY TO CALL?

07:31.852 --> 07:33.821
- NO, I CALLED ON SUNDAY,

07:33.854 --> 07:36.056
AND THE COP SAID SHE WAS
PROBABLY OUT PARTYING.

07:36.089 --> 07:38.125
AND THEN THIS MORNING,
THIS MESSAGE.

07:38.158 --> 07:40.794
- YOU KNOW WHICH
CATERING COMPANY?

07:40.828 --> 07:43.931
- NO, SHE SUBS
DIFFERENT ONES.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.633
- DOES HALEY HAVE
A MAN IN HER LIFE?

07:45.666 --> 07:47.234
- IT'S JUST HALEY AND ME.

07:47.267 --> 07:49.002
SHE WENT BACK
FOR HER G.E.D.

07:49.036 --> 07:52.139
SHE'S REALLY TRYING
TO BE A GOOD MOM.

07:52.172 --> 07:54.675
- SO HALEY'S VOICEMAIL
CAME IN AT 9:00 A.M.,

07:54.708 --> 07:56.109
BUT TARU SAYS THAT
IT WAS A TAPE RECORDING

07:56.143 --> 07:57.878
TO A PAY PHONE
IN GRAND CENTRAL.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.012
- AT RUSH HOUR.

07:59.046 --> 08:00.781
THERE'S NO WAY
THE CAMERAS CAN I.D. HIM.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.249
BENSON, AMARO,
FRIENDS, FAMILY.

08:02.282 --> 08:03.917
YOU KNOW THE DRILL.

08:03.951 --> 08:06.554
- CAPTAIN, TORMENTING THE MOM
WITH A MESSAGE LIKE THAT,

08:06.587 --> 08:08.522
WE COULD BE LOOKING
AT A PSYCHOPATH.

08:08.556 --> 08:10.958
IT SURE DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE AN ACQUAINTANCE RAPE.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.826
- WE STILL HAVE
TO RULE THEM OUT.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.261
- LAST PING
ON HER CELL PHONE

08:14.294 --> 08:16.096
WAS JUST BEFORE
THE TAPPAN ZEE BRIDGE.

08:16.129 --> 08:18.599
THAT PHONE'S GOTTA BE SWIMMING
IN THE HUDSON BY NOW.

08:18.632 --> 08:19.967
BUT WE GOT THE DUMPS
ON HER PHONE.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.835
- AND THERE'S NO TOLL BOOTHS
GOING NORTHBOUND,

08:21.869 --> 08:23.070
WHICH MEANS NO VIDEO.

08:23.103 --> 08:24.972
- OKAY, SO THIS
CATERING SERVICE

08:25.005 --> 08:26.907
THAT CALLED HER
SATURDAY NIGHT?

08:26.940 --> 08:28.909
- 3-4-7 NUMBER
OUT OF QUEENS.

08:28.942 --> 08:30.978
G & S SERVICES, LLC.

08:31.011 --> 08:31.979
- IT'S A FRONT.

08:32.012 --> 08:32.846
LOOK, HEAD OUT TO QUEENS

08:32.880 --> 08:35.048
AND SEE WHAT THE CATERER
IS SERVING.

08:35.082 --> 08:37.050
- YEAH.

08:37.084 --> 08:39.286
- UH, ROLLINS.
- SIR?

08:39.319 --> 08:40.821
- JUST CHECKING IN.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.956
YOU GET THROUGH SUPER BOWL
WEEKEND ALL RIGHT?

08:42.990 --> 08:45.225
- I SKIPPED THE GAME,

08:45.258 --> 08:49.830
BUT, YEAH, I WENT
TO THREE MEETINGS INSTEAD.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.965
STANDING ROOM ONLY
AT EVERY ONE.

08:58.038 --> 09:01.775
- I FACILITATE ENCOUNTERS
BETWEEN CONSENTING ADULTS,

09:01.809 --> 09:02.810
ALL LEGITIMATE.

09:02.843 --> 09:06.747
- OKAY, WAS THIS ONE
OF YOUR CONSENTING ADULTS?

09:09.016 --> 09:11.619
- SHE JUST STARTED WITH US.

09:11.652 --> 09:14.087
AND WHATEVER SHE TOLD YOU,
I AM JUST A MATCHMAKER.

09:14.121 --> 09:16.156
IF SHE DID MORE,
THAT'S ON HER.

09:16.189 --> 09:18.592
- WE DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE DID,
'CAUSE SHE'S MISSING.

09:18.626 --> 09:20.894
AND SHE JUST TURNED 16.

09:20.928 --> 09:22.663
- 16?

09:22.696 --> 09:25.899
HER I.D. SAID 22.

09:25.933 --> 09:28.101
I SWEAR I DIDN'T KNOW
SHE WAS ONLY 16.

09:28.135 --> 09:30.070
- SO YOU'RE GONNA WANT
TO HELP US OUT.

09:30.103 --> 09:31.905
NOW, WHO'D YOU
SET HER UP WITH SATURDAY?

09:31.939 --> 09:34.842
IS HE A REGULAR?

09:34.875 --> 09:37.077
- FIRST-TIME CALLER.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.713
HE USED HIS CELL.

09:39.747 --> 09:41.381
- OKAY, DID SHE GO
TO HIS PLACE?

09:41.414 --> 09:44.051
- NO, HE SAID HE WANTED
TO TAKE HER TO DINNER.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.719
HE WANTED
A GIRLFRIEND EXPERIENCE.

09:45.753 --> 09:47.254
THEY WENT TO A STARBUCKS,
PUBLIC,

09:47.287 --> 09:48.956
SO SHE COULD
CHECK HIM OUT.

09:48.989 --> 09:50.290
- YOU GET HIS
CREDIT CARD INFO?

09:50.323 --> 09:52.793
- HE INSISTED ON PAYING CASH.

09:52.826 --> 09:55.028
GAVE THE NAME "BREWSTER."
- JUST ONE NAME?

09:55.062 --> 09:56.864
YOU CALL THAT LOOKING OUT
FOR YOUR GIRLS?

09:56.897 --> 09:59.032
- I TAKE CARE OF MY GIRLS.

09:59.066 --> 10:01.134
SHE DIDN'T FEEL SAFE
AT HER OTHER AGENCY.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.637
SHE TOLD ME ONE OF THE GIRLS
WENT ON A DATE CHRISTMAS EVE

10:03.671 --> 10:05.205
AND NEVER CAME BACK.

10:06.940 --> 10:10.043
- WE'RE GONNA NEED THE NAME
OF THAT AGENCY.

10:10.077 --> 10:11.979
- YOU'RE ASKING ME
ABOUT AN EMPLOYEE

10:12.012 --> 10:13.313
WHO QUIT ON CHRISTMAS EVE?

10:13.346 --> 10:15.348
THESE ARE MY TAX DOLLARS
AT WORK?

10:15.382 --> 10:16.549
- YOU DON'T PAY TAXES.

10:16.583 --> 10:19.152
- WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT
THE MOST STABLE YOUNG LADIES.

10:19.186 --> 10:20.954
DRUGS, FAMILY PROBLEMS.

10:20.988 --> 10:22.923
LISTEN, I KNOW MY AD SAYS
"COLLEGE GIRLS,"

10:22.956 --> 10:24.725
BUT COME ON.

10:24.758 --> 10:25.959
- WE'RE NOT HERE
TO SHAKE YOU DOWN.

10:25.993 --> 10:27.194
- YET.

10:27.227 --> 10:28.896
- TWO GIRLS ARE MISSING,

10:28.929 --> 10:30.063
AND THEY BOTH
WORKED FOR YOU.

10:30.097 --> 10:32.299
- OH, SHE WAS TERRIBLE.

10:32.332 --> 10:34.001
NEVER HIRE SOMEBODY
WITH A BABY.

10:34.034 --> 10:35.402
I LET HER GO A MONTH AGO.

10:35.435 --> 10:38.371
SO IF SHE'S MISSING NOW,
IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM.

10:38.405 --> 10:39.973
- ACTUALLY,
IT IS YOUR PROBLEM,

10:40.007 --> 10:42.776
'CAUSE SHE WAS WORKING FOR YOU
AND SHE WAS 15 YEARS OLD.

10:42.810 --> 10:45.245
- SON OF A BITCH.

10:45.278 --> 10:49.082
WELL, TECHNICALLY, I SENT HER
OUT AS AN S.A.T. TUTOR.

10:49.116 --> 10:51.284
- OH, WELL, YOU CAN
TELL THAT TO THE D.A.

10:51.318 --> 10:54.021
OR YOU CAN TELL US
ABOUT THE OTHER GIRL,

10:54.054 --> 10:57.024
THE ONE THAT WENT MISSING
ON CHRISTMAS EVE.

11:01.328 --> 11:04.397
- AH. ROXIE.

11:04.431 --> 11:06.033
MY TOP EARNER.

11:06.066 --> 11:07.100
LOOK, I FOUND HER,

11:07.134 --> 11:08.869
HER TEETH WERE ROTTED
FROM THE METH.

11:08.902 --> 11:11.071
BOUGHT HER NEW VENEERS,
CUSPID TO CUSPID,

11:11.104 --> 11:12.172
10 GRAND.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.907
SHE SPLITS ON ME.

11:13.941 --> 11:15.308
THAT'S THE THANKS I GOT.

11:15.342 --> 11:16.777
- TOUGH BREAK.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.145
WE'RE GONNA NEED
THE CREDIT CARD INFO

11:18.178 --> 11:19.246
ON HER JOHN.

11:19.279 --> 11:21.048
- OH.

11:21.081 --> 11:24.251
AH, YEAH, THE GUY SAYS
HE'S GOT A NOSEY WIFE.

11:24.284 --> 11:26.353
WHO DOESN'T?
PAID CASH.

11:26.386 --> 11:29.689
SAID HIS NAME WAS BREWSTER.

11:33.226 --> 11:36.129
- WE'VE GOT TWO MISSING ESCORTS,
HALEY AND ROXIE.

11:36.163 --> 11:38.031
NOW THEY BOTH DISAPPEARED
AFTER HAVING A DATE

11:38.065 --> 11:39.232
WITH A MAN NAMED BREWSTER,

11:39.266 --> 11:41.869
WHO CALLED THE AGENCIES
FROM A BURNER CELL.

11:41.902 --> 11:44.071
HE USED CASH, SAID HE WAS
GONNA BUY THEM DINNER.

11:44.104 --> 11:44.905
- ROXIE?

11:44.938 --> 11:46.907
DID SHE GIVE HER BOSS
A REAL NAME?

11:46.940 --> 11:50.778
- NO, AND NO MISSING PERSON
REPORT MATCHING HER PHOTO.

11:50.811 --> 11:53.246
- OKAY, CHRISTMAS WAS OVER
A MONTH AGO,

11:53.280 --> 11:55.816
SO LET'S HOPE HALEY
IS STILL ALIVE.

11:55.849 --> 11:58.485
THIS BREWSTER,
HOW DID HE FIND THEM?

11:58.518 --> 12:00.988
- BOTH GIRLS
WERE ADVERTISED HERE,

12:01.021 --> 12:03.190
THE BACK PAGE OF
THE DOWNTOWN VOICE.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.191
- THAT'S STILL IN BUSINESS?

12:04.224 --> 12:05.258
- THEM AND THE VILLAGE VOICE,

12:05.292 --> 12:06.526
LAST OF THE MUCKRAKERS.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.996
THE DOWNTOWN VOICE WOULD
HAVE FOLDED A LONG TIME AGO

12:09.029 --> 12:10.197
IF IT WASN'T FOR THOSE ADS.

12:10.230 --> 12:13.066
- EXCEPT ONE OF THESE ADS
IS A PHOTO OF AN UNDERAGE GIRL.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.201
- HE LIKES THEM YOUNG.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.103
THIS IS
A PREDATORY PSYCHOPATH.

12:16.136 --> 12:17.905
HE'S GROOMING HIS VICTIMS,

12:17.938 --> 12:19.006
HANDPICKING THEM
OUT OF THE PAPER.

12:19.039 --> 12:21.308
- IT'S A LITTLE EARLY
TO START PROFILING THIS GUY.

12:21.341 --> 12:23.877
I MEAN, ROXIE'S A PROSTITUTE,
SHE'S A METH HEAD,

12:23.911 --> 12:25.545
AND NO ONE HAS
REPORTED HER MISSING.

12:25.578 --> 12:26.947
- SO WE DON'T CARE ABOUT HER?

12:26.980 --> 12:29.016
- NOW LOOK,
WE GOT A 16-YEAR-OLD,

12:29.049 --> 12:30.350
SINGLE MOM WHO WE THINK
IS BEING TORTURED RIGHT NOW.

12:30.383 --> 12:32.085
LET'S FOCUS ON HER.

12:32.119 --> 12:33.286
- OKAY, POINTS ON ALL SIDE.

12:33.320 --> 12:35.823
NOW, THIS COULD BE A PATTERN.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.290
FIN, ROLLINS, CHECK OUT
THE OTHER AGENCIES

12:37.324 --> 12:39.860
THAT ADVERTISE IN
THE DOWNTOWN VOICE.

12:39.893 --> 12:42.395
SEE IF BREWSTER
HAD ANY OTHER DATES.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.965
AND HALEY WENT MISSING
AFTER MEETING HIM

12:44.998 --> 12:47.034
AT THE STARBUCKS
ON 14TH STREET.

12:47.067 --> 12:48.535
WHERE ARE WE ON THAT CANVASS?

12:48.568 --> 12:51.171
- WE'RE HITTING EVERY RESTAURANT
WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.943
- TABLE THREE.
SHE WAS REALLY SEXY.

12:55.976 --> 12:57.444
- WHAT ABOUT THE GUY?

12:57.477 --> 12:58.946
- EH, TO BE HONEST,

12:58.979 --> 13:00.981
I REALLY WASN'T PAYING
MUCH ATTENTION TO HIM.

13:01.014 --> 13:04.918
UH, THICK GLASSES,
BROWN HAIR.

13:04.952 --> 13:06.153
- WELL, HE PAY BY CREDIT CARD?

13:06.186 --> 13:08.889
- NO, CASH, 10% TIP.

13:08.922 --> 13:10.423
- HOW WERE
THEY GETTING ALONG?

13:10.457 --> 13:12.025
- OH, FIRST DATE.
YOU COULD TELL.

13:12.059 --> 13:13.894
DESSERT, LATTES,

13:13.927 --> 13:15.262
THEY HOGGED THE TABLE
TILL CLOSING.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.497
- YEAH?
AND THEY LEFT TOGETHER?

13:17.530 --> 13:18.999
- MM-HMM.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.567
- ABOUT WHAT TIME?

13:20.600 --> 13:21.935
- AROUND 11:00.

13:21.969 --> 13:23.136
YEAH, I'M TRYING
TO CLOSE UP,

13:23.170 --> 13:24.905
AND THE GUY ASKED
FOR A DOGGY BAG.

13:24.938 --> 13:28.441
THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT
ON HIS PLATE BUT A BONE.

13:30.443 --> 13:33.080
[dog barks]

13:36.216 --> 13:37.517
- [whimpering]

13:37.550 --> 13:39.052
[dog barking]

13:51.664 --> 13:54.267
I CAN'T!
[gunshot]

13:59.406 --> 14:00.573
- FIRST DESCRIPTION
OF BREWSTER.

14:00.607 --> 14:01.574
AVERAGE HEIGHT,
BROWN HAIR,

14:01.608 --> 14:03.276
WEARING DARK-FRAMED GLASSES.

14:03.310 --> 14:05.278
- WELL, HE MUST HAVE SHOWN UP
ON SOMEBODY'S SECURITY CAM.

14:05.312 --> 14:07.514
- HE'S EITHER SMART OR LUCKY.
THERE'S NONE ON THAT BLOCK.

14:07.547 --> 14:09.182
- I'M GUESSING HE'S SMART.

14:09.216 --> 14:11.318
THE GUYS STAYS
UNDERNEATH THE RADAR.

14:11.351 --> 14:14.087
WE CALLED TEN AGENCIES THAT
ADVERTISE IN THE DOWNTOWN VOICE,

14:14.121 --> 14:16.456
HE ONLY RANG A BELL ONCE.

14:16.489 --> 14:18.391
- BOOKER FROM ONE OF THE
AGENCIES SAID A GIRL FREAKED.

14:18.425 --> 14:20.327
BREWSTER TRIED TO GET
THE GIRL INTO HIS CAR.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.963
SHE GOT A BAD FEELING,
AND SHE BOLTED.

14:22.996 --> 14:24.564
- AND WE'VE ONLY
GOT A FIRST NAME.

14:24.597 --> 14:26.266
UH, MIRANDA.
SHE LEFT THE AGENCY.

14:26.299 --> 14:28.268
WE'RE TRYING
TO TRACK HER DOWN.

14:28.301 --> 14:29.970
- AND SHE HAD AN AD
IN THE DOWNTOWN VOICE.

14:30.003 --> 14:32.072
- YEAH, BUT ONLY
THE ONLINE EDITION.

14:32.105 --> 14:34.307
THIS IS HER PHOTO
FROM THE ADVERTISEMENT.

14:34.341 --> 14:37.010
- IF YOU ASK ME,
THE NEWSPAPER'S BECOME A FRONT

14:37.044 --> 14:39.346
FOR ESCORT SERVICES
AND UNDERAGE SEX TRAFFICKING.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.214
- I WOULDN'T HOLD
THEIR ADVERTISING AGAINST THEM.

14:41.248 --> 14:42.549
THEY'RE ONE OF THE FEW PAPERS
IN NEW YORK CITY

14:42.582 --> 14:44.184
DOING REAL REPORTING.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.352
- WE NEED TO GO DOWN
TO THEIR OFFICES,

14:45.385 --> 14:46.920
APPEAL TO THEIR CONSCIENCE,

14:46.954 --> 14:48.655
AND FIND OUT IF BREWSTER
SET UP AN ACCOUNT.

14:48.688 --> 14:50.123
- GOOD LUCK.

14:50.157 --> 14:51.391
- THEY'RE GONNA PREACH
FIRST AMENDMENT.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.460
- THAT'S WHY
I'M SENDING YOU, JOHN.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.195
PLAY THE CIVIL LIBERTIES CARD.

14:55.228 --> 14:58.498
BENSON, GO WITH,
MAKE SURE HE DOESN'T DEFECT.

15:00.433 --> 15:03.136
- MISSING ESCORTS, TRAGIC.

15:03.170 --> 15:05.472
BUT TURNING OVER
OUT ADVERTISING DATABASE,

15:05.505 --> 15:06.673
OUR ONLINE USERS,

15:06.706 --> 15:08.375
I MEAN,
THAT'S A BRIDGE TOO FAR.

15:08.408 --> 15:11.311
WHAT IF PEOPLE CLICKED
ON A POLITICAL ARTICLE,

15:11.344 --> 15:13.380
AND YOU WANTED THEIR NAMES?

15:13.413 --> 15:14.414
- I GET IT,
THE FIRST AMENDMENT

15:14.447 --> 15:16.216
IS MORE THAN JUST A PIECE
OF PAPER TO US TOO.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.018
- MR. ROTH,
HELP US OUT HERE.

15:18.051 --> 15:20.520
WE NEED ACCESS
TO SATURDAY'S WEB TRAFFIC.

15:20.553 --> 15:23.156
IT'LL HELP US FIND
THIS MISSING GIRL.

15:23.190 --> 15:25.358
- WHY NOT THE SOURCES FROM
MY ARTICLES WHILE YOU'RE AT IT?

15:25.392 --> 15:28.461
LOOK, WE ALL KNOW
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

15:28.495 --> 15:29.963
PAYBACK.

15:29.997 --> 15:32.232
WE'VE BEEN HITTING
THE N.Y.P.D. PRETTY HARD.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.701
- I PROMISE YOU, THIS HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH POLITICS.

15:34.734 --> 15:37.004
- YEAH, WELL,
EVERYTHING IS POLITICAL.

15:37.037 --> 15:38.571
- MR. ROTH,
THE GIRL THAT IS MISSING,

15:38.605 --> 15:41.474
HALEY, IS 16 YEARS OLD.

15:41.508 --> 15:42.442
- OKAY, I SEE WHERE
THIS IS GOING.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.577
THIS IS HARASSMENT.
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

15:44.611 --> 15:47.647
- YEAH, HAVE YOUR D.A.
GET IN TOUCH WITH OUR LAWYER.

15:51.084 --> 15:53.453
- YOU'RE ON THE WRONG SIDE HERE.
TRUST ME.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.722
YOU DON'T WANT THIS FIGHT.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.198
- MIRANDA GALTON?

16:05.232 --> 16:07.367
DETECTIVE ROLLINS.
THIS IS DETECTIVE AMARO.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.301
- YEAH?

16:08.335 --> 16:09.669
- WE'RE INVESTIGATING
THE DISAPPEARANCE

16:09.702 --> 16:12.305
OF A TEENAGE GIRL,
AN ESCORT.

16:12.339 --> 16:15.042
- UM, WHAT'S THAT
GOT TO DO WITH ME?

16:15.075 --> 16:18.211
- WELL, YOU WORKED
AT SWEET ELITE AGENCY?

16:18.245 --> 16:21.514
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TAKING ABOUT.

16:21.548 --> 16:23.383
- HONEY, WE'RE NOT HERE
TO BUST YOU.

16:23.416 --> 16:25.352
YOUR BOSS TOLD US
YOU WENT ON A DATE

16:25.385 --> 16:27.687
WITH A MAN THAT SCARED YOU,
BREWSTER.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.522
WE WANNA TALK ABOUT HIM.

16:29.556 --> 16:31.291
- EVERYTHING OKAY, HONEY?

16:31.324 --> 16:32.459
- YEAH.

16:32.492 --> 16:36.063
- WE'RE LOOKING FOR
A NEIGHBORHOOD GROPER.

16:36.096 --> 16:38.065
JUST ASKING
EVERYONE IN THE BUILDING.

16:38.098 --> 16:39.332
- WE'D LIKE YOUR HELP ON IT

16:39.366 --> 16:42.135
IF YOU GUYS COULD BOTH
COME DOWN TO THE PRECINCT,

16:42.169 --> 16:44.404
LOOK THROUGH SOME MUG SHOTS.
- I DOUBT I COULD HELP.

16:44.437 --> 16:46.339
I JUST FINISHED MY DEPLOYMENT,
LIKE, TWO WEEKS AGO.

16:46.373 --> 16:48.041
- WHAT, AFGHANISTAN?

16:48.075 --> 16:49.542
- YEAH, KANDAHAR.

16:49.576 --> 16:50.743
- YEAH, MY WIFE'S
OVER IN KABUL.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.579
360TH, PSY-OPS.

16:52.612 --> 16:55.115
- IT'S TOUGH, MAN.

16:55.148 --> 16:56.816
SUCKS BEING APART.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.086
- LOOK, I KNOW IT'S A REACH,

16:59.119 --> 17:00.420
BUT MARINE CORPS,

17:00.453 --> 17:03.390
I MEAN, IF YOU SAW SOMETHING,
YOU'D REMEMBER.

17:03.423 --> 17:06.426
- OKAY.

17:10.430 --> 17:11.464
- A DONUT SHOP?

17:11.498 --> 17:15.168
YOU CERTAINLY KNOW HOW
TO WOO A COP.

17:15.202 --> 17:17.670
- I LIKE DONUTS.
- [laughs]

17:17.704 --> 17:19.739
- AND IT'S NOWHERE NEAR
OUR OFFICES.

17:19.772 --> 17:21.308
- THAT IS TRUE.

17:21.341 --> 17:23.543
SO THE DOWNTOWN VOICE
DIDN'T WASTE ANY TIME

17:23.576 --> 17:25.345
PUTTING UP A DEFENSE.

17:25.378 --> 17:28.848
- STUDY FINDS FEW UNDERAGE
PROSTITUTES WORK WITH PIMPS.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.650
YEAH, I READ IT.

17:30.683 --> 17:32.252
MAKES SOME GOOD POINTS.

17:32.285 --> 17:35.155
- WELL, THEY'RE CLAIMING
THAT THESE GIRLS WORK ALONE.

17:35.188 --> 17:36.489
IF THERE ARE NO PIMPS,

17:36.523 --> 17:38.391
THEN THE DOWNTOWN VOICE
CAN'T BE AN ACCESSORY.

17:38.425 --> 17:41.128
- SLOW DOWN.
AN ACCESSORY TO WHAT?

17:41.161 --> 17:44.097
- THEY'RE FACILITATING
UNDERAGE SEX TRAFFICKING.

17:44.131 --> 17:45.865
- IT'S GONNA BE HARD ENOUGH
TO GET A WARRANT

17:45.898 --> 17:47.434
FOR THEIR DIGITAL SUBSCRIBERS.

17:47.467 --> 17:49.336
- AND THAT'S WHY
I WANNA GO AFTER THEM

17:49.369 --> 17:50.837
WITH EVERYTHING WE HAVE.

17:50.870 --> 17:52.772
THEY KNOW WHAT THESE ADS ARE,
THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

17:52.805 --> 17:55.875
THEY'RE COMPLICIT.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.510
WE COULD SET UP A STING.

17:57.544 --> 17:59.146
PROVE THAT THEY KNOW.

17:59.179 --> 18:01.481
THAT'S GOT TO BE ENOUGH
FOR AN INJUNCTION, RIGHT?

18:01.514 --> 18:03.416
SHUT THE BACK PAGES DOWN.
- NOT LIKELY.

18:03.450 --> 18:05.485
THE ADS DON'T EXPLICITLY
PROMISE SEX.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.620
WE CAN'T PROVE THAT
THEY BENEFITED MATERIALLY.

18:07.654 --> 18:09.856
THE PAPER HASN'T BROKEN
ANY LAWS.

18:09.889 --> 18:12.359
- COME ON, DAVID, EVERYBODY
KNOWS WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON.

18:12.392 --> 18:13.826
- HANG ON A SECOND.

18:13.860 --> 18:16.796
LIV, WE CAN'T CALL IN

18:16.829 --> 18:19.266
ANY CHITS ON EACH OTHER.

18:19.299 --> 18:22.769
THIS, US,
IT ONLY WORKS

18:22.802 --> 18:25.538
IF I DON'T GET NEAR
A CASE YOU'RE WORKING ON.

18:27.707 --> 18:31.878
AND FOR THE RECORD,
DETECTIVE...

18:31.911 --> 18:34.447
I DO WANT THIS TO WORK.

18:41.288 --> 18:42.555
[phone chimes]

18:42.589 --> 18:44.157
THAT'S YOU.

18:44.191 --> 18:45.892
YOUR CAPTAIN AGAIN?
- OH.

18:45.925 --> 18:47.727
IT'S THE MISSING GIRL'S
MOTHER.

18:52.399 --> 18:56.403
- JUST PICK OUT ANYONE
THAT LOOKS FAMILIAR.

18:56.436 --> 18:58.671
- THESE GUYS ALL LOOK SHADY.

18:58.705 --> 19:02.409
- IF THEY DIDN'T,
THEY WOULDN'T BE IN THAT BOOK.

19:02.442 --> 19:04.577
- MY HUSBAND CAN NEVER KNOW
ABOUT WHAT I DID, OKAY?

19:04.611 --> 19:05.945
IT'S OVER NOW.
- WE UNDERSTAND.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.647
WE'RE KEEPING HIM BUSY.
- WE'RE NOT JUDGING YOU.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.350
WE REALLY JUST WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT BREWSTER.

19:10.383 --> 19:12.619
YOU SAID
THAT HE SCARED YOU.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.787
WHY?

19:17.924 --> 19:19.492
- NOT AT FIRST.

19:19.526 --> 19:21.428
UM, WE HAD A NICE DINNER.

19:21.461 --> 19:22.229
WE WALKED TO HIS CAR.

19:22.262 --> 19:25.565
HIS DOG WAS IN THE BACK
IN A CAGE.

19:26.466 --> 19:27.634
AND THEN I LOOKED DOWN,

19:27.667 --> 19:28.935
AND I SAW SHOVELS
ON THE FLOOR.

19:28.968 --> 19:30.537
IT REALLY CREEPED ME OUT.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.372
- AND DID HE WANT TO TAKE YOU
BACK TO HIS PLACE?

19:32.405 --> 19:35.408
- NO, UM, HE WANTED
TO GO FOR A DRIVE.

19:35.442 --> 19:36.743
HE SAID HE KNEW A BEACH.

19:36.776 --> 19:39.846
ROMANTIC.
30 MINUTES AWAY.

19:39.879 --> 19:42.215
THERE WAS SOMETHING
ABOUT HIM, THOUGH.

19:42.249 --> 19:44.617
HIS DOG,
I DON'T KNOW.

19:44.651 --> 19:47.754
I SAID I WAS FEELING SICK
AND I GOT OUTTA THERE.

19:49.522 --> 19:50.957
- WHAT DID BREWSTER LOOK LIKE?

19:50.990 --> 19:55.528
- BROWN HAIR, AVERAGE GUY,
AVERAGE LOOKS.

19:55.562 --> 19:58.665
UH...HE WORE
DARK-RIMMED EYEGLASSES.

19:58.698 --> 20:01.801
- WHAT ABOUT THE CAR?
- HE HAD A GRAY JEEP.

20:01.834 --> 20:05.272
- DO YOU REMEMBER
ANY LICENSE NUMBERS?

20:05.305 --> 20:08.275
- NO, HE HAD
A BUMPER STICKER.

20:08.308 --> 20:10.410
A LITTLE OVAL ONE.

20:10.443 --> 20:12.512
MAYBE "M.V." OR "M.B."
SOMETHING.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.981
- OKAY, NOW YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT KINDA BREED THE DOG WAS?

20:15.014 --> 20:16.449
- I DON'T KNOW DOGS.

20:16.483 --> 20:18.451
IT HAD SPOTS,
KINDA LIKE A LEOPARD.

20:18.485 --> 20:19.652
- A DALMATIAN?

20:19.686 --> 20:22.889
- NO, DARKER FUR.

20:22.922 --> 20:25.425
AND A TAIL
KINDA LIKE A RACCOON.

20:25.458 --> 20:27.494
[knock at door]

20:31.831 --> 20:33.032
- HALEY'S MOM CALLED.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.468
GOT ANOTHER MESSAGE
FROM HER DAUGHTER.

20:35.502 --> 20:38.538
- MOMMY, I'M COLD.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.440
I DON'T WANNA PLAY ANYMORE,

20:40.473 --> 20:44.611
BUT IF I STOP HE'LL KILL ME.

20:44.644 --> 20:46.613
HELP ME.

20:46.646 --> 20:50.049
MOMMY, PLEASE.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.451
[click]
- THAT'S IT.

20:51.484 --> 20:52.752
- SHE SOUNDS WEAKER.

20:52.785 --> 20:54.354
- HOPEFULLY
SHE'S STILL ALIVE.

20:54.387 --> 20:55.488
- YEAH, HE COULDA TAPED THIS
TWO DAYS AGO,

20:55.522 --> 20:58.491
AND HALEY COULD BE GONE.

20:58.525 --> 21:00.827
YOU KNOW, MAYBE HE IS GETTING
OFF ON TORTURING HER MOTHER.

21:00.860 --> 21:01.994
- OH, HE'S GETTING OFF ON IT.

21:02.028 --> 21:03.496
- GOT A SKETCH ARTIST
COMING IN.

21:03.530 --> 21:06.466
JUST KEEP WORKING
YOUR WITNESS.

21:06.499 --> 21:07.967
- TALK ABOUT A FACE THAT
DOESN'T STAND OUT IN A CROWD.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.802
I BET HIS OWN MOTHER COULDN'T
I.D. HIM IN A LINEUP.

21:09.836 --> 21:10.937
- NOBODY NOTICES HIM.

21:10.970 --> 21:12.372
MAYBE THAT'S HOW
HE GETS AWAY WITH IT.

21:12.405 --> 21:13.506
- WE MIGHT HAVE BETTER LUCK
WITH THE MUTT.

21:13.540 --> 21:15.575
DARK SPOTS, RACCOON TAIL.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.410
- WE'RE LOOKING AT
A BLUE HEELER,

21:17.444 --> 21:18.878
HUNTING DOG, RARE.

21:18.911 --> 21:21.481
SO VETS, BREEDERS,
A.S.P.C.A.

21:21.514 --> 21:22.649
- I CHECKED
ON EVERY BLUE HEELER

21:22.682 --> 21:23.983
REGISTERED IN
THE TRI-STATE AREA,

21:24.016 --> 21:25.418
GOT CALLS IN
TO ALL THE KENNELS.

21:25.452 --> 21:26.819
- WHAT ABOUT THE VEHICLE?

21:26.853 --> 21:28.688
- DMV'S GOT THOUSANDS
OF GRAY JEEPS,

21:28.721 --> 21:30.323
BUT THAT STICKER.

21:30.357 --> 21:32.825
- YEAH, SHE SAID EITHER
M.V. OR M.B.

21:32.859 --> 21:34.361
- M.V. COULD BE
MARTHA'S VINEYARD.

21:34.394 --> 21:35.528
THERE'S A LOT
OF CRIMINALS UP THERE.

21:35.562 --> 21:37.497
- NO, THAT'S SIX HOURS
AND A FERRY RIDE.

21:37.530 --> 21:39.899
NOW, BREWSTER SAID THAT
IT WAS A 30-MINUTE DRIVE.

21:39.932 --> 21:42.469
- ALL RIGHT, YOU ALL GOT
ANY IDEAS FOR M.B.?

21:42.502 --> 21:45.071
- MORICHES BAY.
- MASTIC BEACH.

21:45.104 --> 21:47.440
- THAT'S STILL TOO FAR.
YOU EVER DRIVE ON THE L.I.E.?

21:47.474 --> 21:50.443
- ALL RIGHT, HOLD ON,
M.B., 30 MINUTES.

21:50.477 --> 21:52.579
CHECK BROOKLYN.
MILL BASIN, MANHATTAN BEACH.

21:52.612 --> 21:54.414
- LOTTA GUYS ON THE JOB
LIVE OUT THERE.

21:54.447 --> 21:56.015
SOMEBODY MIGHT
HAVE SEEN SOMETHING.

21:56.048 --> 21:57.484
- IT'S A LONG SHOT
BUT TAKE A RIDE.

21:57.517 --> 21:58.618
HIT THE SIX-OH, SIX-ONE.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.487
TRAFFIC STOPS,
PARKING TICKETS,

22:00.520 --> 22:04.457
ANYTHING THEY HAVE ON
A GRAY JEEP OR A BLUE HEELER.

22:06.759 --> 22:08.761
- GRAY JEEP?
THAT'LL TAKE ME A WHILE.

22:08.795 --> 22:10.730
I PULL A DOZEN A MONTH
AROUND HERE.

22:10.763 --> 22:11.998
I'M THE SUMMONS KING
OF BROOKLYN SOUTH.

22:12.031 --> 22:14.434
- YOU KNOW, LET'S TRY
TO NARROW THIS DOWN.

22:14.467 --> 22:16.836
THIS GUY LOOK FAMILIAR?

22:16.869 --> 22:19.639
- NEXT.
- WHAT ABOUT HER?

22:19.672 --> 22:20.640
- NO.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.141
- HER?
- NO.

22:22.174 --> 22:25.745
I THINK I'D REMEMBER
WRITING THEM UP A SUMMONS.

22:25.778 --> 22:27.614
HEY, IS THE DOG MISSING TOO?

22:27.647 --> 22:29.616
- HAVE YOU SEEN HIM?
- ONE JUST LIKE IT.

22:29.649 --> 22:31.518
SAW A GUY WALKING HIM
WITHOUT A LEASH.

22:31.551 --> 22:32.985
I ALMOST WROTE HIM UP.

22:33.019 --> 22:34.487
- THIS WAS ON MANHATTAN BEACH?

22:34.521 --> 22:36.589
- NO, DEAD HORSE BAY.

22:36.623 --> 22:37.957
I DIDN'T HAVE THE HEART.

22:37.990 --> 22:39.626
IT WAS NEW YEAR'S EVE.

22:39.659 --> 22:40.927
POOR GUY HAD A SHOVEL.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.762
HE JUST BURIED
HIS OTHER DOG.

22:54.507 --> 22:56.776
- DETECTIVES!

22:56.809 --> 22:59.412
[dogs barking]

23:11.123 --> 23:13.192
- THERE'S TOO MUCH DECOMP
FOR HALEY.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.061
[dogs barking]

23:15.094 --> 23:16.463
IT COULD BE ROXIE.

23:16.496 --> 23:18.531
HEY, LIV.

23:18.565 --> 23:22.101
[dogs barking]

23:22.134 --> 23:23.536
- MY GOD.

23:29.609 --> 23:31.744
WE NEED BACKUP.

23:45.658 --> 23:46.926
- A HUNDRED YEARS AGO,
DEAD HORSE BAY

23:46.959 --> 23:48.728
WAS THE CITY'S BURIAL GROUND
FOR HORSES.

23:48.761 --> 23:50.196
- AND NOW IT'S
A KILLING FIELD.

23:50.229 --> 23:51.030
- TECHNICALLY, NO.

23:51.063 --> 23:52.532
I DON'T THINK
HE KILLED THEM HERE.

23:52.565 --> 23:53.766
JUST DUMPED THEM.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.768
- SO WE'RE UP TO SEVEN SO FAR?
- GIVE OR TAKE.

23:55.802 --> 23:58.838
THERE WERE SOME PARTIALS,
LIKE THIS ONE.

23:58.871 --> 24:00.773
ALL THAT'S LEFT
AFTER DECOMP--

24:00.807 --> 24:02.709
PART OF AN ARM
AND SOME DENTAL REMAINS.

24:02.742 --> 24:04.911
- ANYTHING TO RULE OUT
ONE KILLER?

24:04.944 --> 24:06.112
- SO FAR, NO.

24:06.145 --> 24:07.514
BUT THAT'S GONNA TAKE TIME
TO SORT OUT.

24:07.547 --> 24:08.615
- WELL, WE'RE LOOKING
FOR A GIRL

24:08.648 --> 24:09.749
WHO WENT MISSING
SATURDAY NIGHT.

24:09.782 --> 24:11.651
- NO WAY THE DOGS
WOULD HAVE MISSED HER.

24:11.684 --> 24:16.055
FRESHEST BODY WE HAVE
HAS BEEN DEAD ABOUT 30 DAYS.

24:16.088 --> 24:18.157
- SO HALEY'S NOT HERE.

24:26.899 --> 24:28.968
- COUNSELOR.
- DETECTIVES.

24:29.001 --> 24:31.137
- YOU'RE REAL HANDS-ON.

24:31.170 --> 24:33.840
- I WANTED TO SEE FOR MYSELF.

24:33.873 --> 24:35.141
HAVE THE SCENE IN MY HEAD

24:35.174 --> 24:37.844
BEFORE I GO AFTER
THE DOWNTOWN VOICE.

24:44.283 --> 24:45.885
- ZARA'S TRYING
TO CONVINCE ME

24:45.918 --> 24:48.888
THAT CANDY CORN
IS A VEGETABLE.

24:48.921 --> 24:51.023
- WELL, IT IS A VEGETABLE.

24:51.057 --> 24:52.892
RIGHT?

24:57.029 --> 24:58.998
WHAT'S GOING ON, NICK?

25:01.734 --> 25:04.036
- I'M ON A CASE.

25:04.070 --> 25:06.238
IT'S A SERIAL KILLER.

25:06.272 --> 25:08.675
SEVEN BODIES, MAYBE MORE.

25:08.708 --> 25:11.243
GIRLS NOBODY MISSED.

25:11.277 --> 25:13.746
- SOMEBODY MISSES THEM.

25:16.182 --> 25:19.185
- YOU'VE BEEN TOUGH TO GET
AHOLD OF THE LAST FEW DAYS.

25:19.218 --> 25:22.054
- WELL, I'VE BEEN BUSY.

25:22.088 --> 25:23.756
BEEN IN THE FIELD.

25:23.790 --> 25:25.124
- YEAH, WELL,
IF YOU CAN'T REACH ME,

25:25.157 --> 25:26.092
SHOOT ME A TEXT.

25:26.125 --> 25:27.760
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT GOES THROUGH MY HEAD.

25:27.794 --> 25:29.796
- I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT GOES THROUGH YOUR HEAD?

25:29.829 --> 25:32.098
WOW, OKAY. I'M FINE.
[door opens]

25:32.131 --> 25:34.233
- YEAH, I KNOW YOU'RE FINE.

25:37.169 --> 25:38.938
- M.E. IS READY FOR US.

25:40.372 --> 25:42.742
[door closes]

25:47.313 --> 25:50.182
- LISTEN--
- YEAH, I KNOW.

25:50.216 --> 25:53.152
- BE SAFE.

25:53.185 --> 25:56.022
- YOU TOO.

26:03.395 --> 26:06.232
- SERIAL KILLER.

26:06.265 --> 26:08.100
NUMBER'S UP TO 11 VICTIMS,

26:08.134 --> 26:11.270
ALL WOMEN 18 TO 25.

26:11.303 --> 26:12.772
NO I.D.s YET.

26:12.805 --> 26:13.973
HE PICKED WELL.

26:14.006 --> 26:17.143
- SO IT WAS ONE GUY.
HOW WERE THEY KILLED?

26:17.176 --> 26:18.778
- ALL THE VICTIMS WHOSE
CAUSE WE COULD CONFIRM

26:18.811 --> 26:20.112
WERE ASPHYXIATED.

26:20.146 --> 26:22.782
SOME WERE HANGED,
SOME WERE STRANGLED.

26:22.815 --> 26:25.251
AND THEY ALL HAD KETAMINE
ON THEIR TOX SCREENS.

26:25.284 --> 26:27.620
- SPECIAL K?

26:27.654 --> 26:31.157
IT'S A HORSE TRANQUILIZER.
HALLUCINATIONS, MEMORY LOSS.

26:31.190 --> 26:33.359
- NOT A BAD WAY TO CONTROL
YOUR VICTIM.

26:33.392 --> 26:35.161
- SO HOW LONG AGO
WAS SHE KILLED?

26:35.194 --> 26:36.896
- THE COLD SLOWED DOWN DECOMP.

26:36.929 --> 26:38.965
I'M PUTTING T.O.D.
AT FOUR WEEKS.

26:38.998 --> 26:42.802
- THAT'S AROUND NEW YEAR'S.
COULD BE ROXIE.

26:42.835 --> 26:45.004
- MAY I?
- SURE.

26:47.807 --> 26:50.209
- VENEERS.
- MMM.

26:50.242 --> 26:52.044
- HER PIMP SAID THAT
HE PAID FOR THESE.

26:52.078 --> 26:53.345
- LOOK AT THE PLAQUE BUILDUP.

26:53.379 --> 26:54.947
SHE HASN'T BRUSHED
IN A WHILE.

26:54.981 --> 26:56.883
- THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
FOR AN ESCORT.

26:56.916 --> 26:58.050
- NO, NEITHER DOES HER DIET.

26:58.084 --> 27:00.086
I FOUND ACORNS
IN HER G.I. TRACT.

27:00.119 --> 27:03.155
- ACORNS?

27:03.189 --> 27:06.125
WHAT, LIKE SHE WAS FORAGING
FOR SURVIVAL?

27:06.158 --> 27:08.961
- HER UNDERARMS AND LEGS
WERE UNSHAVED.

27:08.995 --> 27:11.230
ALSO NOT WHAT YOU WOULD
EXPECT IN A WORKING GIRL.

27:11.263 --> 27:14.100
- THERE WERE NO OAK TREES
ON THAT BEACH.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.068
- SO HIS KILL SITE,
IT COULD BE ANYWHERE.

27:16.102 --> 27:18.237
- SO IS THERE ANY WAY
FOR US TO NARROW IT DOWN?

27:18.270 --> 27:19.205
- MAYBE.

27:19.238 --> 27:20.973
SHE HAD TICKS.

27:21.007 --> 27:22.141
COULD HELP US.

27:22.174 --> 27:24.110
SINCE THE SPREAD
OF LYME DISEASE,

27:24.143 --> 27:26.879
TICK DNA HAS BEEN CATALOGUED
DOWN TO THE COUNTY.

27:26.913 --> 27:31.017
MIGHT GET YOU TO WHERE
SHE WAS INFESTED.

27:31.050 --> 27:33.219
- MY OFFICE
AND THE N.Y.P.D.

27:33.252 --> 27:36.889
ARE GOING AFTER THE PERSON
OR PERSONS RESPONSIBLE

27:36.923 --> 27:38.024
FOR THIS TRAGEDY.

27:38.057 --> 27:39.158
BUT IT'S NOT
JUST THE KILLER

27:39.191 --> 27:40.392
WE'RE PUTTING ON NOTICE.

27:40.426 --> 27:41.994
IT'S THE ESCORT SERVICES

27:42.028 --> 27:43.462
IN THE BACK PAGES
OF PAPERS

27:43.495 --> 27:45.097
LIKE THE DOWNTOWN VOICE

27:45.131 --> 27:47.266
WHO PIMP OUT
THESE YOUNG WOMEN

27:47.299 --> 27:49.769
AND MARK THEM
AS EASY PREY.

27:49.802 --> 27:53.773
EACH OF THESE VICTIMS
WAS SOMEONE'S SISTER,

27:53.806 --> 27:55.474
DAUGHTER, MOTHER.

27:55.507 --> 27:59.211
THEY WERE MORE THAN THE SUM
OF WHAT THEY DID FOR A LIVING

27:59.245 --> 28:01.180
OR WHERE THEY CAME FROM.

28:01.213 --> 28:03.315
THEY WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN.

28:03.349 --> 28:05.718
- WHY HAVEN'T YOU FOUND
MY DAUGHTER?

28:05.752 --> 28:07.119
IT'S BEEN A WEEK.

28:07.153 --> 28:10.189
- MA'AM, WE ARE DOING
EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN.

28:10.222 --> 28:12.191
- LIKE YOU DID
FOR THESE GIRLS?

28:14.160 --> 28:16.729
[reporters shouting]

28:16.763 --> 28:17.897
- YOU'RE IN CHARGE
OF IDENTIFICATION.

28:17.930 --> 28:19.298
MISSING PERSONS,
TRI-STATE AREA,

28:19.331 --> 28:21.067
ESCORT ADS.

28:21.100 --> 28:23.169
COORDINATE AND CROSS-REFERENCE
THE AUTOPSIES

28:23.202 --> 28:25.337
WITH DETAILS FROM THESE.
- SO I WANNA MAKE SURE

28:25.371 --> 28:27.139
EVERYTHING GOES INTO VICAP,
OKAY?

28:27.173 --> 28:29.842
WE'RE LOOKING FOR HITS
ON KETAMINE, STRANGULATION.

28:29.876 --> 28:32.244
- HALEY'S MOM
GOT ANOTHER CALL.

28:32.278 --> 28:33.479
BENSON'S WITH HER NOW.

28:33.512 --> 28:35.948
- SO HALEY
COULD STILL BE ALIVE.

28:35.982 --> 28:38.785
THE M.E. FOUND KETAMINE
IN ALL THE VICS?

28:38.818 --> 28:40.219
- YEAH, PROBABLY PUTTING THEM
IN A K-HOLE.

28:40.252 --> 28:41.487
INCAPACITATING HIS VICTIMS

28:41.520 --> 28:43.022
BEFORE HE TORTURES
AND KILLS THEM.

28:43.055 --> 28:44.190
- CAPTAIN.

28:44.223 --> 28:46.058
- ARE WE ANYWHERE
ON THESE JANE DOES?

28:46.092 --> 28:46.926
- DOING OUR BEST.

28:46.959 --> 28:48.360
ANY I MAY HAVE A LEAD
ON YOUR KILLER.

28:48.394 --> 28:51.397
ENTOMOLOGIST'S REPORT
ON THE TICKS ON ROXIE.

28:51.430 --> 28:54.000
THEY WERE ABLE TO TRACE
THE DNA TO ULSTER COUNTY.

28:54.033 --> 28:55.902
- THE CATSKILLS?

28:55.935 --> 28:57.770
- IT'S CONSISTENT WITH
THE ACORNS AND THE PLANT LIFE

28:57.804 --> 28:59.906
WE FOUND IN HER G.I. TRACT.

28:59.939 --> 29:03.242
- SO HALEY'S PHONE LAST PINGED
AT THE TAPPAN ZEE.

29:03.275 --> 29:05.077
A STRAIGHT SHOT
TO THE MOUNTAINS.

29:05.111 --> 29:07.213
- SO HE'S TAKING
THESE GIRLS UPSTATE,

29:07.246 --> 29:09.148
SEDATING THEM,
STRANGLING THEM--

29:09.181 --> 29:12.952
- AND THEN BURYING THEIR
BODIES IN DEAD HORSE BAY.

29:12.985 --> 29:16.055
- MY GUESS IS
HIS KILLING GROUND IS UPSTATE,

29:16.088 --> 29:18.124
THEN THE BAY SERVES
AS HIS TROPHY CASE.

29:18.157 --> 29:19.992
HE MIGHT LIVE NEAR THERE.

29:20.026 --> 29:21.460
HE'D WANNA KEEP THEM
CLOSE BY.

29:21.493 --> 29:23.562
- ALL RIGHT, FIN, ROLLINS,
HEAD UP TO ULSTER COUNTY.

29:23.595 --> 29:26.265
TALK TO THE STATE POLICE,
LOCAL P.D.

29:26.298 --> 29:28.134
USE WHAT WE HAVE,
ALL RIGHT?

29:28.167 --> 29:30.036
THE JEEP, THE SKETCH, THE DOG.

29:30.069 --> 29:32.304
YOU PICK UP BENSON,
CHECK THE LOCAL E.R.s.

29:32.338 --> 29:36.275
LET'S HOPE SOMEBODY GOT AWAY
FROM THIS SON OF A BITCH.

29:38.177 --> 29:40.246
- SO SAUGERTIES P.D.
TOLD OUR PARTNERS

29:40.279 --> 29:42.414
THAT THEY HAD A JANE DOE
AROUND LABOR DAY

29:42.448 --> 29:43.983
SUFFERING FROM EXPOSURE?

29:44.016 --> 29:45.284
- AND PROBABLY HIGH
ON KETAMINE.

29:45.317 --> 29:48.320
- KETAMINE? 20s?

29:48.354 --> 29:51.223
SHE WAS RUSHED UP.
ROPE BURNS ON HER NECK.

29:51.257 --> 29:52.892
- DID YOU DO A RAPE KIT?

29:52.925 --> 29:55.061
- SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT BEING RAPED.

29:55.094 --> 29:57.163
SHE COULDN'T EVEN REMEMBER
HER OWN NAME.

29:57.196 --> 29:58.464
AS IT WAS,
SHE WAS FIGHTING.

29:58.497 --> 30:00.199
WE HAD TO RESTRAIN HER.

30:00.232 --> 30:02.068
TREATED HER
FOR DERMAL ABRASIONS.

30:02.101 --> 30:03.269
GOT HER REHYDRATED.

30:03.302 --> 30:05.604
WHEN SHE CAME DOWN SHE STILL
COULDN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING.

30:05.637 --> 30:07.273
I ASKED HER
FOR HER NEXT OF KIN,

30:07.306 --> 30:10.042
SHE KEPT SAYING BREWSTER.

30:10.076 --> 30:11.510
- DID STATE POLICE
FOLLOW UP?

30:11.543 --> 30:13.112
- THERE WAS
NO MISSING PERSONS ON HER,

30:13.145 --> 30:14.280
NO I.D.

30:14.313 --> 30:16.248
I SENT HER FOR A PSYCH EVAL.

30:16.282 --> 30:18.184
FOR ALL I KNOW,
SHE'S STILL THERE.

30:21.187 --> 30:22.621
- WHY SHOULD I TELL YOU
ABOUT BREWSTER?

30:22.654 --> 30:26.592
THE DOCTORS,
THEY DON'T BELIEVE ME.

30:26.625 --> 30:28.895
- BELIEVE YOU ABOUT WHAT,
LIZZIE?

30:30.930 --> 30:32.865
HONEY, IT'S OKAY,
YOU CAN TELL US.

30:32.899 --> 30:35.868
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

30:35.902 --> 30:38.270
DON'T MAKE ME GO BACK THERE.

30:39.271 --> 30:41.073
- IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

30:41.107 --> 30:43.009
I PROMISE YOU,
WE'RE NOT GOING TO.

30:43.042 --> 30:47.079
JUST WANNA TALK.

30:47.113 --> 30:50.216
- LIZZIE.

30:50.249 --> 30:51.984
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHERE HE TOOK YOU?

30:52.018 --> 30:54.987
- I DON'T WANT
TO PLAY ANYMORE.

30:58.157 --> 31:00.592
- DID HE DO THAT TO YOU?

31:00.626 --> 31:03.195
LIZZIE, LET ME SEE.
I JUST WANNA LOOK, OKAY?

31:05.031 --> 31:06.565
I'M JUST GONNA LOOK.

31:10.336 --> 31:12.404
DID BREWSTER DO THAT TO YOU?

31:12.438 --> 31:16.375
- I DID IT TO MYSELF.

31:18.077 --> 31:20.412
IT WAS THE ONLY WAY
TO END THE GAME.

31:34.593 --> 31:35.627
- HE GAVE ME A ROPE.

31:35.661 --> 31:38.030
SAID I COULD END THE GAME
WHEN I GOT TIRED OF IT.

31:38.064 --> 31:40.099
I GOT TIRED.

31:40.132 --> 31:42.401
BUT MY BRANCH BROKE.

31:42.434 --> 31:45.171
- WHAT WAS THE GAME, LIZZIE?

31:45.204 --> 31:48.707
- HE TOLD ME TO RUN AND HIDE,

31:48.740 --> 31:53.479
AND THEN HE'D COME AFTER ME
WITH ORION, HIS DOG.

31:53.512 --> 31:56.082
I COULD HEAR THEM OUT THERE.

31:56.115 --> 31:58.217
AND THEN THE DART
WOULD GO IN ME.

31:58.250 --> 32:00.352
- HE USE A TRANQUILIZER GUN?

32:03.589 --> 32:06.258
- THEN HE'D DRAG ME
TO THE SHACK.

32:06.292 --> 32:08.594
I COULDN'T MOVE
MY ARMS AND LEGS.

32:08.627 --> 32:10.296
I WOULD JUST WATCH HIM

32:10.329 --> 32:12.664
INSIDE OF ME.

32:12.698 --> 32:15.567
- SO HE HUNTED YOU,

32:15.601 --> 32:18.370
AND THEN HE RAPED YOU.

32:20.439 --> 32:23.976
- CAN YOU DESCRIBE
WHERE YOU WERE?

32:24.010 --> 32:26.078
- WOODS.

32:26.112 --> 32:27.980
THERE WAS WATER
ON THREE SIDES.

32:28.014 --> 32:30.549
THERE WAS AN ELECTRIC FENCE.
A LOT OF BIRDS.

32:30.582 --> 32:32.985
- WAS HE THERE
THE WHOLE TIME?

32:33.019 --> 32:35.054
- SOMETIMES HE'D LEAVE.

32:35.087 --> 32:37.156
SOMETIMES HE'D STAY
IN THE SHACK.

32:37.189 --> 32:40.092
THERE WAS A CRAWL SPACE
UNDERNEATH.

32:40.126 --> 32:43.629
I HID THERE ONCE,
BUT HE KNEW.

32:43.662 --> 32:45.464
HE WAS CLEANING HIS GUN,

32:45.497 --> 32:49.135
TALKING TO THE DOG
ABOUT WHAT HE'D DO TO ME.

32:49.168 --> 32:50.736
IT'S ALL PART OF THE GAME.

32:50.769 --> 32:55.707
- SO, LIZZIE,
HOW DID YOU GET AWAY?

32:55.741 --> 32:58.244
- ONE NIGHT
THERE WAS A BIG STORM.

32:58.277 --> 32:59.745
I MADE IT OUT TO THE FENCE.

32:59.778 --> 33:02.048
I THOUGHT--I THOUGHT
IF I TOUCHED IT WHEN IT WAS WET

33:02.081 --> 33:03.549
IT WOULD BE OVER,

33:03.582 --> 33:08.987
BUT I--I DIDN'T GET SHOCKED.

33:11.623 --> 33:13.725
- THE ELECTRICITY WAS OUT.

33:13.759 --> 33:15.761
WAS IT HURRICANE IRENE?

33:15.794 --> 33:18.464
- I CLIMBED OVER AND RAN.

33:18.497 --> 33:20.499
COPS PICKED ME UP
THE NEXT DAY,

33:20.532 --> 33:23.369
BUT NOBODY BELIEVED ME.

33:23.402 --> 33:25.104
- WE BELIEVE YOU.

33:25.137 --> 33:27.606
AND WE'RE GONNA HELP YOU
GET BACK HOME.

33:27.639 --> 33:30.109
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

33:30.142 --> 33:32.078
NO, IT'S SAFE HERE.

33:32.111 --> 33:35.581
HE CAN'T GET ME.

33:36.815 --> 33:38.517
AND IF I ACTUALLY
MATTERED TO ANYBODY,

33:38.550 --> 33:41.620
WOULDN'T THEY
HAVE FOUND ME BY NOW?

33:45.624 --> 33:47.793
- OUR KILLER PLAYS WITH
HIS VICTIMS LIKE A CAT.

33:47.826 --> 33:51.730
IF THE PREY STOPS FIGHTING BACK,
THEN HE ENDS THE GAME.

33:51.763 --> 33:53.065
- ALL RIGHT,
SO LIZZIE GOT AWAY

33:53.099 --> 33:54.433
AND THEN SHE WALKED FOR A DAY

33:54.466 --> 33:56.468
BEFORE BEING PICKED UP
BY SAUGERTIES P.D.?

33:56.502 --> 33:57.736
- I'M GUESSING
IN HER CONDITION

33:57.769 --> 33:59.171
SHE COULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN
MORE THAN, WHAT,

33:59.205 --> 34:00.672
FIVE, SIX MILES.

34:00.706 --> 34:01.840
- SO WE'RE LOOKING
FOR SOMEPLACE

34:01.873 --> 34:04.276
SURROUNDED BY WATER
ON THREE SIDES,

34:04.310 --> 34:07.146

34:13.119 --> 34:15.621
THAT'S ABOUT SIX MILES
FROM WHERE THEY PICKED HER UP.

34:15.654 --> 34:18.357
- STRAIGHT DOWN 87 TO I-95.

34:18.390 --> 34:20.359
HE COULD DUMP A BODY
IN DEAD HORSE BAY

34:20.392 --> 34:21.793
WITHIN THREE HOURS.

34:21.827 --> 34:23.229
- AND IT'S GOT
PLENTY OF ACREAGE.

34:23.262 --> 34:24.596
IT'S ENCLOSED.

34:24.630 --> 34:25.864
MAKES A GOOD HUNTING GROUND.

THIS TIME OF YEAR.

34:36.908 --> 34:38.277

I DON'T WANT ANY OF THIS
STUFF TOSSED OUT IN COURT.
