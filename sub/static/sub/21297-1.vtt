00:21.062 --> 00:23.480
Tell me about Mother and Father again.

00:24.699 --> 00:27.515
Ma and Pa got the fever and went to sleep...

00:27.835 --> 00:30.954
...and now they're in a big
white cloud with God.

00:31.939 --> 00:33.825
Is heaven warm?

00:34.975 --> 00:36.811
Nice and warm.

00:37.211 --> 00:40.297
Like a big down blanket
wrapped all around you.

00:41.482 --> 00:44.501
No one's mean, or hurts you in heaven?

00:45.787 --> 00:47.470
No, my sweet.

00:49.457 --> 00:51.475
When do we get to go?

00:53.260 --> 00:55.145
Only when it's your turn.

00:57.182 --> 00:59.266
How will we know when?

01:00.485 --> 01:02.170
You'll know.

01:02.270 --> 01:04.287
But only when it's your turn.

01:06.241 --> 01:08.125
Do you miss them?

01:09.276 --> 01:11.094
Of course I do, silly.

01:11.812 --> 01:13.631
Me too.

01:15.949 --> 01:16.784
Whores.

01:16.884 --> 01:19.570
- I'm scared.
- Cover your eyes.

01:23.591 --> 01:27.444
I'm always gonna be here
to protect you, okay?

01:27.862 --> 01:29.713
And I'll protect you.

01:32.533 --> 01:33.779
Whore...

01:33.879 --> 01:35.937
...get yourself cleaned up,
you've got a customer.

01:36.037 --> 01:38.296
Okay. Go hide in the closet...

01:38.396 --> 01:41.880
...cover your ears and hum
the song until I come get you.

01:43.043 --> 01:46.229
I'll be okay. I always am.

01:54.155 --> 01:57.374
Cover your ears.
Don't come out until I get you.

02:08.669 --> 02:11.158
- Where is she?
- Sir.

02:11.772 --> 02:16.194
- The girl, your sister. Where is she?
- She's not here, sir. She...

02:21.683 --> 02:25.853
Listen to me! I'ma let you
breathe again and when I do...

02:25.953 --> 02:29.006
...you're gonna tell him exactly
what he wants to hear.

02:32.359 --> 02:38.099
Oh, please. Please...
Please, she's just a child.

02:38.199 --> 02:41.621
Please, please, just let her be. She's...

02:41.721 --> 02:44.172
Just give her a few more years.
Maybe I can work up her debt...

02:44.272 --> 02:48.491
It's too late for that. She's gonna have
to work harder now that you're sold.

02:48.943 --> 02:51.395
No. We have to stay together!

03:13.801 --> 03:15.953
I own you now.

03:21.175 --> 03:23.793
Alice! Ali...

05:45.619 --> 05:47.671
Come on, don't bail on me.

05:50.824 --> 05:54.277
All right. I'll switch shifts or something.

06:49.182 --> 06:51.198
You're always so good to me, Joe.

06:53.887 --> 06:55.738
Thank you.

06:56.823 --> 06:58.841
What are you doing tomorrow night?

06:59.426 --> 07:00.944
Working.

07:02.863 --> 07:04.765
Wanna make triple?

07:04.865 --> 07:06.716
I'm not like that, honey.

07:07.300 --> 07:11.547
But the next girls walking in,
they're more what you like.

07:13.173 --> 07:14.991
See you next week.

07:15.676 --> 07:17.560
Yeah, you will.

07:20.914 --> 07:22.498
Dude.

07:23.784 --> 07:25.653
What took you so long?

07:25.753 --> 07:27.571
Stuck at work.

07:28.789 --> 07:31.758
- Thank you.
- You work too much.

07:31.858 --> 07:34.344
Not everyone's a rich bastard like you, bro.

07:39.600 --> 07:42.152
- Wassup, buddy.
- Wassup, man.

07:42.269 --> 07:44.805
Sammie. Good to see you.

07:44.905 --> 07:46.773
Hey, get these boys some drinks, will you?

07:46.873 --> 07:48.892
Sure, absolutely.

07:51.545 --> 07:53.246
- From the party?
- Mm-hmm.

07:53.346 --> 07:56.320
- Who else is coming?
- Plus you guys, Michael.

07:56.420 --> 07:59.052
- He's coming down from the city.
- Nice, man, it's been a while.

07:59.152 --> 08:01.121
Yeah, I'm bringing Lex.

08:01.221 --> 08:03.489
Nice. Tapping it yet?

08:03.589 --> 08:06.443
No, but I think she's gonna take
the inaugural spin this week.

08:06.543 --> 08:08.512
- That a boy.
- It's about time.

08:08.612 --> 08:11.148
I don't know if I'ma be
able to make it though.

08:11.248 --> 08:14.285
I told... Krista I'd hang out with her.

08:14.385 --> 08:17.536
- Oh, for Christ's sake.
- Are you serious?

08:17.654 --> 08:21.774
- Unless she can come.
- Unless she can... she hates me, man.

08:21.925 --> 08:25.163
I know but just like a... just a little.

08:25.663 --> 08:27.998
Dude, ditch the bitch, come hang with us.

08:28.098 --> 08:30.033
All right, I'll talk to her.
But you know how she is.

08:30.133 --> 08:32.736
- All right, you'll talk to her?
- You know how she is.

08:32.836 --> 08:36.489
- Ah, come on.
- Weak, dude. Weak.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.525
Oh, here we go.

08:47.551 --> 08:49.085
Hello.

08:49.185 --> 08:51.255
I heard you do private parties?

08:51.655 --> 08:53.624
What type of private parties?

08:54.124 --> 08:58.395
Let's just say there's a lot more wads
of cash for the right type of dancing.

09:03.900 --> 09:07.186
- I'm in.
- Yeah, you are.

09:10.341 --> 09:12.576
Zeke, it's me.

09:13.924 --> 09:15.761
Open the door.

09:30.393 --> 09:32.896
I've got the really good stuff.

09:32.996 --> 09:36.286
Acid. Now I was thinking
we could do it tomorrow night.

09:40.070 --> 09:43.489
- God, you smell like cigars.
- I was at the titty bar.

09:47.578 --> 09:51.214
- And you didn't invite me?
- Wasn't very much fun anyway.

09:51.314 --> 09:53.351
Hmm, 'cause I wasn't there.

09:54.351 --> 09:58.037
- You don't like my friends.
- I like most of them.

10:34.958 --> 10:37.528
How are you? I'm Adam.

10:37.628 --> 10:38.795
- What's up.
- Hey, Adam.

10:38.895 --> 10:40.196
- Hi, Anita.
- Hello.

10:40.296 --> 10:42.478
- It's Jenny, right?
- Yeah.

10:42.578 --> 10:46.002
- Good, thanks for coming.
- What's up?

10:46.102 --> 10:48.271
This place is sick.

10:48.371 --> 10:50.474
- It's a nice little home, isn't it?
- This is so cool.

10:50.574 --> 10:53.010
Have a seat, ladies,
make yourselves comfortable.

10:53.110 --> 10:56.762
- Yeah, absolutely.
- That's not even sexy.

10:57.881 --> 11:00.717
Hey, where are you two
scoundrels running off to?

11:01.352 --> 11:03.587
- Oh, my God.
- He's my cousin.

11:03.687 --> 11:06.634
He hits puberty and look at him go.

11:07.774 --> 11:10.293
They're gonna get lost
in this place, man, it's huge.

11:10.393 --> 11:13.379
- This is crazy.
- I told you it was awesome.

11:13.730 --> 11:15.666
Hey, look at that.

11:15.766 --> 11:18.001
- Wow.
- 1898, baby.

11:18.101 --> 11:21.321
- That's kind of creepy.
- I know, huh.

11:23.574 --> 11:25.876
Yeah, kind of turns me on, actually.

11:25.976 --> 11:28.311
We need some drinks, don't we?
You want some drinks?

11:28.411 --> 11:29.613
- Yes.
- Okay.

11:29.713 --> 11:31.982
Mind if we explore the place a little?

11:32.082 --> 11:36.135
By all means, yes, just don't get lost.
Make sure you come back.

11:39.222 --> 11:41.191
See you in a little bit, boys.

11:41.291 --> 11:43.176
Bye bye.

12:14.424 --> 12:16.642
This place is ridiculous.

12:26.703 --> 12:28.206
Jesus.

12:29.006 --> 12:30.556
Wow.

14:02.032 --> 14:03.883
What's up, man?

14:05.301 --> 14:07.170
Really is good to see you, man.

14:07.570 --> 14:10.040
- You too, buddy.
- Hm.

14:11.140 --> 14:13.442
Basement hasn't changed much, huh?
Since we were kids.

14:13.542 --> 14:15.654
- No.
- This place still creeps me out.

14:15.754 --> 14:17.596
Very creepy.

14:17.914 --> 14:20.217
Hey, let's get that wood on the fire.

14:20.317 --> 14:23.002
Let's do it. Party time.

14:25.088 --> 14:27.924
- There you are.
- Hey. You get lost or what?

14:28.024 --> 14:30.341
I'm trying to. This place is amazing.

14:30.441 --> 14:33.313
It's not hard. It looks good.

14:35.131 --> 14:36.983
Oh, hello.

14:39.802 --> 14:41.654
This place is amazing.

14:42.339 --> 14:44.986
- Yeah, you should see my place.
- Why, is it like this?

14:45.086 --> 14:48.745
- No, but you should see it.
- Okay, awesome.

14:49.545 --> 14:51.131
Yeah.

14:53.383 --> 14:55.944
Wow, man, look at them.

14:56.044 --> 14:57.854
Told you.

14:58.054 --> 15:02.292
- Get 'em all for yourself, man.
- Yeah, life is good, can't complain.

15:02.392 --> 15:03.909
Whoa.

15:04.895 --> 15:06.262
- What's up, man.
- What's up, Zeke.

15:06.362 --> 15:07.998
- Not much. How you doing?
- Good to see you.

15:08.098 --> 15:11.167
- Where were you, man?
- I was back there sneaking a beer.

15:12.067 --> 15:14.703
I was in the fridge. How you doing?
I haven't seen you in ages.

15:14.803 --> 15:17.073
- It's been a while.
- You still in the city?

15:17.173 --> 15:19.676
- NYC. You need to come visit.
- Yeah, I will. You still acting?

15:19.776 --> 15:21.578
- Still trying.
- Think you can get me in there?

15:21.678 --> 15:24.431
- Yeah.
- Nice, dude. I seen you on that...

15:24.531 --> 15:27.617
- What was it? The hemorrhoids commercial?
- Constipation.

15:27.717 --> 15:29.152
Sorry, man.

15:29.252 --> 15:32.105
I've obviously got the face
of a man who can't shit.

15:33.590 --> 15:35.298
- Painful.
- Twenty grand.

15:35.398 --> 15:36.593
Woo, yeah.

15:36.693 --> 15:39.563
- Krista. How are you?
- Hey. Good, how are you?

15:39.663 --> 15:42.199
- Good, real good to see you.
- You're famous.

15:42.299 --> 15:44.567
- Oh, I wouldn't say that.
- Yeah, you are.

15:44.667 --> 15:47.138
- We just stopped by for a little bit.
- Very cool.

15:47.238 --> 15:49.439
Zeke, it's nice to see you
brought your own hoe.

15:49.539 --> 15:52.959
- Up yours, Joe.
- And nice to see you too, Krista.

15:54.377 --> 15:57.948
- So, place looks good?
- Yeah, it's bomb, dude, the crown.

15:58.048 --> 16:00.183
All this inset in the ceiling. This...

16:00.283 --> 16:02.852
They did a nice job restoring it.
It's real nice.

16:02.952 --> 16:06.389
Yeah, it's kind of weird that your dad
restored this place after what happened.

16:06.489 --> 16:09.760
- Hey.
- Hey. Every home has a history.

16:09.860 --> 16:12.395
Some are just more flavorful than others.

16:12.495 --> 16:14.079
Yeah.

16:34.634 --> 16:36.218
Hey.

16:42.209 --> 16:44.461
So did Joe tell you about the house?

16:47.047 --> 16:49.065
It used to be a brothel.

16:54.688 --> 16:56.906
Joe's great grandpa founded it.

16:59.859 --> 17:03.713
You got me. I'm the descendant of pimps.

17:04.498 --> 17:08.983
If he didn't tell you about the house, then
he certainly didn't tell you about Alice.

17:11.971 --> 17:14.473
<i>It all started over 100 years ago.</i>

17:14.574 --> 17:17.193
<i>Two sisters were forced into prostitution.</i>

17:18.345 --> 17:21.281
<i>Their names were Alice
and her sister Delilah.</i>

17:21.381 --> 17:24.483
<i>Their parents had died of a terrible
fever, leaving the two girls...</i>

17:24.583 --> 17:28.321
<i>...and their only known relative, an uncle.</i>

17:28.422 --> 17:32.225
<i>Unfortunately their uncle was a horrible
man who had a gambling problem.</i>

17:32.325 --> 17:34.956
<i>He sold the girls to a local brothel...</i>

17:35.056 --> 17:39.598
<i>...which was owned by Joe's
great grandpa, Sr. Davenport...</i>

17:39.698 --> 17:41.383
<i>...to repay his debt.</i>

17:41.501 --> 17:43.503
Use her for something.

17:43.603 --> 17:47.422
- You eat like a horse.
- What'd you say?

17:47.741 --> 17:51.678
I said it is he who eats like a horse.

17:51.778 --> 17:53.563
You reply with a sir!

17:53.846 --> 17:57.000
It is he who eats like a horse. Sir.

17:59.953 --> 18:03.106
- Innocence mixed with defiance.
- Yes.

18:03.206 --> 18:05.071
I like it.

18:05.459 --> 18:08.895
You'll find that they're
usually very obedient.

18:08.995 --> 18:13.816
Especially the older one.
But you'll have no problems.

18:18.938 --> 18:21.557
- What's your name?
- Alice.

18:23.109 --> 18:25.528
From now on you're Alice D.

18:38.425 --> 18:42.562
<i>Years went by, and Alice grew
into a beautiful young woman.</i>

18:42.762 --> 18:47.249
<i>Constantly defiant. Sr. Davenport
had her chained to the bed.</i>

18:48.184 --> 18:53.039
<i>Her beauty and spirit were what
Sr. Davenport loved the most.</i>

19:44.357 --> 19:46.689
No, no!

20:44.884 --> 20:46.786
So, what happened to her?

20:46.886 --> 20:48.705
She offed herself.

20:52.058 --> 20:55.094
That's a... that's a beautiful little story.

20:55.194 --> 20:57.447
Except it's not a story.

20:57.547 --> 20:59.782
It's the truth and you know it.

21:03.270 --> 21:07.051
Hey, why you gotta come
in here and be a buzz kill?

21:08.541 --> 21:11.010
- Are you jealous?
- No.

21:11.710 --> 21:13.930
I think you're jealous.

21:15.381 --> 21:17.400
I think you want this.

21:18.385 --> 21:22.355
I don't wanna be anything like you.
Or your family.

21:22.455 --> 21:27.059
Treating people like their objects,
making money off of human slaves.

21:27.159 --> 21:29.763
Wow. How original.

21:30.163 --> 21:32.499
That was a long time ago, sweetheart.

21:32.599 --> 21:37.242
Yeah. Except all through high school
you used to brag about your family history.

21:38.738 --> 21:42.826
Look at you. You're still
treating women like objects.

21:44.010 --> 21:46.129
Women are objects.

21:48.881 --> 21:51.602
Beautiful luscious objects.

21:53.353 --> 21:56.723
And it seems to be sometimes
they like to be objectified.

21:56.823 --> 21:59.243
- Am I right?
- Mm-hmm.

22:00.760 --> 22:03.246
Listen, Krista...

22:05.231 --> 22:08.886
I'm sorry but... I'm just not that into you.

22:10.369 --> 22:15.242
I know deep down inside you wanna
climb up on me and hate fuck.

22:15.342 --> 22:17.561
But you're just not my type.

22:18.545 --> 22:20.363
I hate you.

22:21.580 --> 22:26.670
Well, if you hate me so much,
and if you hate all of this...

22:27.687 --> 22:29.623
...why don't you just beat it.

22:29.723 --> 22:31.891
I think I'm ready to go.

22:31.991 --> 22:34.861
Hmm, okay.

22:34.961 --> 22:36.896
That was an all-time record.

22:37.496 --> 22:39.916
Don't let Alice scare you too much.

22:55.147 --> 22:58.435
Not here. I want a nicer room.

23:01.120 --> 23:03.006
Yes, ma'am.

23:18.905 --> 23:20.774
Oh, hey.

23:20.874 --> 23:22.425
Hey.

23:24.011 --> 23:26.580
I'm Michael, I don't know
if you remember from earlier.

23:26.680 --> 23:28.080
- Jenny.
- Hey, Jenny.

23:28.180 --> 23:29.516
Hey.

23:29.616 --> 23:32.436
- It's a pretty cool place huh?
- Mm-hmm.

23:34.220 --> 23:36.756
So you know Joe, is that right?

23:36.856 --> 23:39.726
Oh, no, I know Natasha.

23:39.826 --> 23:42.278
- You're friends with Natasha.
- Mm-hmm.

23:43.896 --> 23:46.188
How do you guys know each other?

23:46.288 --> 23:48.318
We just know each other.

23:48.901 --> 23:50.420
Work.

23:54.674 --> 23:56.209
You okay?

23:56.309 --> 23:59.245
Uh, yeah.

23:59.345 --> 24:02.014
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. It's just...

24:02.614 --> 24:06.269
It's nothing. I'm... I'm ready to party.

24:07.319 --> 24:10.162
- Do you wanna get a drink?
- Yeah, I'm sorry. I should have offered.

24:10.262 --> 24:12.544
Yeah. Okay.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.572
Hmm.

24:25.672 --> 24:28.393
- Krista brought that, man.
- Really?

24:28.493 --> 24:31.978
Yes. It's not really smart leaving that
stuff around you, I know that for sure.

24:32.078 --> 24:34.080
She put a nice little ribbon
on there and everything.

24:34.180 --> 24:35.765
Nice.

24:37.484 --> 24:40.440
- Classy chick.
- Yeah, she is.

24:41.420 --> 24:45.028
Oh, well, at least she's got
good taste in liquor. Shall we?

24:45.128 --> 24:48.394
- Yeah, man, pour some out.
- Hey, you guys, want some whiskey?

24:48.494 --> 24:51.314
- Yeah.
- All right.

24:55.101 --> 24:56.536
Jesus.

24:56.636 --> 24:58.837
How many staircases are in this place?

24:58.937 --> 25:00.840
A lot. Let's go.

25:00.940 --> 25:03.827
- Pictures and paintings.
- Is that it?

25:05.244 --> 25:08.114
- Yeah, this is it.
- Oh, yeah. There it is my man.

25:08.214 --> 25:11.634
- Right there.
- Isn't this the Rumsky room?

25:12.251 --> 25:17.123
This is the Rumsky room. Sally Rumsky.
Your old blue bags, your remember her?

25:17.523 --> 25:21.428
Damn that girl had a...
Sally Rumsky didn't hear it.

25:21.528 --> 25:24.931
This is the stash spot right here, man.
Many o nights.

25:29.401 --> 25:32.423
- Memories, man.
- Memories. Memories.

25:46.118 --> 25:48.972
So... Jen.

25:51.157 --> 25:55.027
I didn't get to meet you last night but...
I'm glad you're here.

25:55.127 --> 25:56.646
Thanks.

25:57.496 --> 25:59.633
Did Natasha explain everything to you?

25:59.733 --> 26:01.934
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

26:02.034 --> 26:05.055
Tasha, you explain the rules to Jen?

26:08.107 --> 26:10.910
- I just wanna make sure we're cool.
- Yeah.

26:11.010 --> 26:13.413
I mean, I love to have a good time and...

26:14.313 --> 26:16.548
...I wanna make sure we're on the same page.

26:18.617 --> 26:20.436
You see, I'm..

26:20.536 --> 26:22.794
...I'm paying you a lot of money...

26:23.594 --> 26:26.486
...which means I own your ass tonight.

26:28.027 --> 26:31.247
Anything me and my boys want, we get.

26:31.998 --> 26:34.017
- You got it?
- Mm-hmm.

26:35.401 --> 26:36.919
Yeah.

26:38.404 --> 26:39.990
Okay.

26:41.240 --> 26:43.060
Put that down.

26:46.145 --> 26:47.964
Hey, hey.

26:52.852 --> 26:56.139
Hey. Relax. Relax.

26:57.189 --> 26:58.774
Relax.

27:07.099 --> 27:08.919
Just relax.

27:14.707 --> 27:16.726
Yeah, that's better.

27:18.611 --> 27:20.346
That's better.

27:20.446 --> 27:26.252
So you're not even gonna get like a small
percentage of trust fund or whatever?

27:26.352 --> 27:29.240
Probably not. You still love me?

27:30.756 --> 27:32.408
Here we go.

27:35.428 --> 27:37.430
Hey, what about this one, baby?

27:37.730 --> 27:39.064
- Yeah.
- Huh?

27:39.164 --> 27:41.050
Looks good.

27:50.242 --> 27:52.245
This place is so big.

27:52.745 --> 27:54.998
Just keeps going and going.

28:03.389 --> 28:05.792
Maybe I should have slept with your cousin.

28:06.492 --> 28:08.512
If he wasn't such a prick.

28:10.196 --> 28:12.082
You better be kidding.

28:19.872 --> 28:22.692
There's like so many random little crevices.

28:23.543 --> 28:25.394
Hey, come here.

28:25.645 --> 28:28.448
- Babe?
- What? What's the matter?

28:28.548 --> 28:31.184
Were you looking at that whore
downstairs in the black dress?

28:31.284 --> 28:33.569
Hey, don't say that, all right?

28:34.854 --> 28:37.694
I don't care about anyone but you.

28:38.558 --> 28:42.566
It's just that right when that one girl...

28:42.666 --> 28:44.409
- ...with the black dress...
- Mm-hmm.

28:44.509 --> 28:46.432
- ...came in.
- Yeah.

28:46.532 --> 28:50.208
You just kind of stopped kissing me.

28:52.371 --> 28:54.457
No, I didn't.

28:55.140 --> 28:58.978
But... that doesn't matter now because...

28:59.078 --> 29:01.337
...you are my little angel...

29:01.987 --> 29:04.238
...and this is our weekend.

29:08.187 --> 29:10.222
What is this?

29:10.322 --> 29:11.907
What?

29:13.225 --> 29:14.728
Oh.

29:15.728 --> 29:17.580
Well, that's kind of sexy.

29:18.297 --> 29:20.332
They just hooked onto the bed?

29:21.667 --> 29:23.519
You wanna use them?

29:23.869 --> 29:25.705
Come on, let's use them.

29:26.305 --> 29:29.975
- Or not.
- You know those whores are going to hell.

29:30.075 --> 29:31.963
Oh, just kiss me.

29:41.286 --> 29:43.523
If you wanna use them,
we can but we don't have to.

29:43.623 --> 29:45.708
Tonight might be special.

29:53.232 --> 29:55.518
- What the hell was that?
- What was that?

30:04.710 --> 30:06.562
Do you hear that?

30:57.964 --> 30:59.499
Go!

31:01.333 --> 31:03.752
Get out! Get out!

31:25.691 --> 31:27.527
- Lighten up.
- Okay.

31:27.627 --> 31:30.078
- Drink, okay?
- Okay.

31:48.480 --> 31:50.350
Trying to blaze.

31:51.350 --> 31:54.454
- They're hot chicks, man, right?
- Yeah.

31:54.554 --> 31:55.921
Oh, yeah.

31:56.021 --> 31:58.041
Joe out did himself, man.

31:58.958 --> 32:02.211
Uh... that Jenny girl
seems like a sweetheart.

32:03.829 --> 32:05.731
Dude, you sweet on her?

32:05.831 --> 32:08.367
Yeah, I sweet... I sweet on her.

32:08.467 --> 32:10.436
I knew you would be.

32:10.536 --> 32:14.906
No, I mean she seems sweet.
She's... yeah, she's shy.

32:15.006 --> 32:17.893
I don't think she realizes
how gorgeous she is.

32:21.247 --> 32:23.666
You... you want her first?

32:26.018 --> 32:28.487
I'm just saying if you like her, you know...

32:28.787 --> 32:30.923
...you should probably get with that first.

32:31.023 --> 32:34.510
- Mm-hmm.
- Just a thought, that's all I'm saying.

32:35.260 --> 32:38.998
And she's perfect.
I mean, she's totally perfect for you.

32:39.098 --> 32:41.367
Joe must have picked her out.

32:42.067 --> 32:44.287
For you, particularly.

32:46.504 --> 32:49.141
What do you mean... what do you mean,
Joe picked her out for me?

32:49.241 --> 32:51.376
What do you mean, what do I mean?

32:51.476 --> 32:55.750
What you just said.
Joe must have picked her out for me.

32:56.716 --> 33:00.329
Oh, my God. Dude, the girls are hookers, man.

33:00.429 --> 33:03.639
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

33:07.327 --> 33:10.330
Holy shit. Wow.

33:10.430 --> 33:13.683
Dude, I wouldn't worry about it,
because they're totally paid for.

33:13.866 --> 33:17.153
Courtesy Joe, man. He hooked it up.

33:18.804 --> 33:23.498
Yeah, well, look, Adam,
I don't have to pay for sex.

33:25.077 --> 33:29.181
I do. I mean, I don't, but I do.

33:29.281 --> 33:33.051
Like sometimes,
depending on the chick really.

33:33.151 --> 33:36.355
Fat girls, they love me, I don't know why.

33:36.455 --> 33:38.924
Gravitational pulls, I don't know.

33:39.424 --> 33:41.444
She seemed like a cool chick.

33:46.431 --> 33:47.800
No, dude, I wouldn't worry about it.

33:47.900 --> 33:50.836
Just bang the hell out of her,
and then love will follow.

33:50.936 --> 33:53.912
Aren't you guys getting a little too old
for this shit? I mean you were...

33:54.012 --> 33:56.276
...pulling these pranks back in high school.

33:56.976 --> 33:59.068
No, man, I don't think so.

34:04.917 --> 34:09.755
Great. I came all the way home for this
party and all the girls are prostitutes.

34:09.855 --> 34:11.556
That's fantastic.

34:11.657 --> 34:13.909
This is fantastic, guys.

34:14.893 --> 34:17.697
You know, if I wanted a hooker
I could have just stayed in New York.

34:17.797 --> 34:20.632
Dude. What are you talking about?

34:20.732 --> 34:23.803
Dude, it's gonna be amazing. Hey, Michael!

34:24.203 --> 34:27.648
Shit. This place is haunted.

34:30.909 --> 34:34.480
All women are whores, okay? These one's
aren't allowed to play hard to get.

34:34.580 --> 34:38.418
- Dude.
- Hey, lighten up. All right?

34:38.518 --> 34:41.969
Get yourself a drink.
Let's have some fun, come on.

34:43.589 --> 34:47.210
He's right, you know. Women.

34:58.818 --> 35:01.607
What's wrong with you?
At least they're not bad looking.

35:01.707 --> 35:06.946
I mean, they're good looking guys.
At least they're not... fat and hairy.

35:07.046 --> 35:09.548
Or smelly, ew.

35:09.648 --> 35:13.319
Anita, can you go hang out
with the guys a little bit?

35:13.419 --> 35:16.306
- Give us a second.
- Fine.

35:27.166 --> 35:29.201
Listen, you're gonna stop pouting
and start having fun...

35:29.301 --> 35:32.171
...or else this is gonna be
the worst night of your life.

35:32.271 --> 35:34.757
Hey. I'm talking to you.

35:35.340 --> 35:37.910
Do you want the money or not?
Because it's kinda a done deal.

35:38.010 --> 35:41.313
Yeah, I need money.
I have my tuition and my sister's sick...

35:41.413 --> 35:44.716
I don't... you don't have
to tell me why, okay?

35:44.816 --> 35:48.237
We all have our reasons
for being here, trust me, I get it.

35:49.521 --> 35:52.124
You have to be appearing to have fun, okay?

35:52.224 --> 35:55.527
You're making me look like
an idiot for bringing you here.

35:55.927 --> 35:59.999
Do you know how many girls would have
clawed your eyes out for this job?

36:00.099 --> 36:01.617
Tons.

36:02.067 --> 36:04.594
He wanted someone sweet
and innocent and lucky for you...

36:04.694 --> 36:08.391
...you're the only bitch I know that's
sweet and innocent anymore, okay?

36:09.241 --> 36:11.410
Listen, stop, stop, stop.

36:11.510 --> 36:13.328
I'm sorry.

36:13.912 --> 36:15.915
I'm sorry that we have to do this, okay?

36:17.015 --> 36:20.046
I'm sorry for whatever's going on in your
head or at home and whatever, okay...

36:20.146 --> 36:22.805
...but the best advice I can give you...

36:24.890 --> 36:28.118
...just... just try to have fun, okay?

36:29.294 --> 36:31.931
- Let's go make you a drink.
- Okay.

36:32.031 --> 36:34.218
- Just loosen up.
- Okay.

36:34.318 --> 36:36.023
- It'll be good.
- Okay.

36:36.123 --> 36:38.788
All right. Come on.

37:02.694 --> 37:04.780
So you ready to party?

37:05.697 --> 37:09.576
- What should I make you?
- Something that'll make me...

37:12.604 --> 37:16.026
Look, I didn't know
that you guys were hookers.

37:17.276 --> 37:19.106
Sorry, I'm not into it.

37:21.313 --> 37:23.366
Just tell me what you want to drink.

37:31.090 --> 37:32.908
I'm not a hooker.

37:34.659 --> 37:38.463
You're not a hooker? Then what are you?

37:38.563 --> 37:40.383
Screw you.

37:42.767 --> 37:45.988
You don't even know me
so you have no right to judge me.

37:46.805 --> 37:48.841
I'm not judging you,
I'm just not into hookers.

37:48.941 --> 37:50.760
I said I'm not a hooker.

37:51.910 --> 37:55.764
- Then why are you here?
- Why are you here?

37:56.248 --> 37:59.518
I'm here because one of
my best friends is throwing a party.

37:59.618 --> 38:01.901
I had no clue that he hired you.

38:03.422 --> 38:07.026
- Well, I really need the money.
- You need the money.

38:07.726 --> 38:10.830
- So you're just willing to...
- Listen, I need the money.

38:10.930 --> 38:13.165
Come on, get a job.

38:13.265 --> 38:15.834
- I have a job.
- Then get another one.

38:15.934 --> 38:18.870
This isn't me, okay.
You have no right to judge me.

38:18.970 --> 38:20.989
This is a one-time thing.

38:21.540 --> 38:23.592
I'm doing this for one night.

38:54.590 --> 38:55.624
- Wow.
- You suck.

38:55.724 --> 38:58.126
- Wow, that is...
- Oh!

38:58.226 --> 39:01.062
- That was close.
- I almost won.

39:01.162 --> 39:03.066
Yeah. Okay.

39:03.166 --> 39:06.368
- How many layers do you have?
- It's a secret, it's a secret, it's a secret.

39:06.468 --> 39:10.573
What's under there?
Oh, got some chalk on your belly.

39:11.673 --> 39:14.630
- Here, you guys.
- That's a good start.

39:16.077 --> 39:17.913
Oh, my God!

39:18.013 --> 39:21.450
Couldn't really spin on it. So get naked.

39:21.550 --> 39:24.600
Pants. Pants. It's a war.

39:24.700 --> 39:26.906
Depends how you define winning.

39:32.961 --> 39:34.780
I'm gonna go...

39:45.073 --> 39:46.892
There you are.

39:47.743 --> 39:51.480
- Let me show you my room.
- I thought you were playing.

39:51.580 --> 39:55.000
Oh, nah, this is more fun.

41:34.482 --> 41:35.650
This is it.

41:35.750 --> 41:38.787
- Oh, that was nice.
- I almost got it.

41:38.887 --> 41:41.924
No, you didn't, but see the whole
problem is you hit the 12 ball and...

41:42.024 --> 41:43.892
Really close.

41:43.992 --> 41:46.761
The cue ball is the one you wanna start with.

41:46.861 --> 41:48.629
Nice. Ah.

41:48.729 --> 41:51.232
Michael, yes, finally. God.

41:51.332 --> 41:54.036
Where you been all my life, man?
I need a partner.

41:54.136 --> 41:56.155
Look at these ladies.

42:01.343 --> 42:03.579
- How are you?
- Where's Joe and Jenny?

42:03.679 --> 42:05.280
Who?

42:05.580 --> 42:08.550
I don't know, man. We were playing,
Joe took off right in the middle of the game.

42:08.650 --> 42:10.903
Who cares about them? Come join us.

42:11.720 --> 42:13.989
He must be showing her around, partner.

42:14.089 --> 42:16.458
Why don't you enjoy Adam's too?

42:16.558 --> 42:20.235
Yes, yes. That's a fantastic idea, man.

42:20.335 --> 42:23.398
See I'm depending on you.
This is really important, okay?

42:23.498 --> 42:25.985
Wear big balls. Go.

42:32.740 --> 42:34.960
Yes. Yes.

42:36.044 --> 42:37.913
- Nice, ladies.
- We lost.

42:38.013 --> 42:40.119
- Oh, well.
- Show the goods.

42:40.219 --> 42:42.466
What do you got, what do you got for me?

42:48.456 --> 42:50.275
That's a good start.

42:50.859 --> 42:52.744
That's good too.

42:53.695 --> 42:55.531
You're gonna enjoy this.

42:56.031 --> 42:57.916
I guarantee it.

44:12.007 --> 44:13.525
Yeah.

44:22.417 --> 44:24.852
Oh. Bad timing, buddy.

44:24.952 --> 44:26.755
We're getting busy here.

44:26.855 --> 44:29.541
Hey, can I...

44:31.192 --> 44:33.995
Can you what, man? Spit it out.

44:34.095 --> 44:36.564
I kind of wanted to bang her first.

44:39.034 --> 44:40.852
Lucky girl.

44:44.772 --> 44:46.592
You know what?

44:48.243 --> 44:50.062
My gift to you.

45:08.696 --> 45:10.549
Don't be too nice.

45:12.867 --> 45:14.702
Come on, let's go to a room.

45:14.802 --> 45:19.892
No, no, no, no, no. You stay here.
You use mine, okay? I like that.

45:21.276 --> 45:23.094
Get in there.

45:58.313 --> 46:00.826
- What are you staring at?
- I'm staring at a girl...

46:00.926 --> 46:03.377
...who is obviously in over her head.

46:08.823 --> 46:12.393
- I didn't ask for your help.
- I'm sorry, you're right.

46:12.493 --> 46:16.051
You're right. Do you want me
to go get Joe and Adam too?

46:16.531 --> 46:21.036
I was informed about 30 minutes ago
that tonight is anything goes, so...

46:21.136 --> 46:23.004
...I'd be more than happy
to go get them for you.

46:23.104 --> 46:26.178
They'd probably be willing
to come up here for a good time.

46:29.978 --> 46:34.343
Just so you know...
I'm not interested in sleeping with you.

46:38.019 --> 46:40.105
The feelings are mutual.

46:50.531 --> 46:52.534
- Devils.
- Devils.

47:03.979 --> 47:05.613
- Man.
- Alpha female.

47:05.713 --> 47:09.117
- The dominant.
- The dom. The dom.

47:09.517 --> 47:11.370
It just depends.

47:32.457 --> 47:34.476
Rough is extra, baby.

47:45.186 --> 47:47.239
- You wanna get a room?
- Yeah.

47:52.760 --> 47:54.814
Who is this creepy old dude?

47:55.931 --> 47:57.765
Oh, so now you're talking to me?

47:57.865 --> 48:01.320
I'm asking for information.
Doesn't mean I like you.

48:06.741 --> 48:10.428
It's Joe's great grandfather. Sr. Davenport.

48:10.945 --> 48:12.748
How do you know?

48:13.148 --> 48:16.200
Joe had it hanging in his bedroom
when we were kids.

48:16.984 --> 48:18.537
What a creep.

48:22.290 --> 48:24.710
Is the story true about that girl Alice?

48:25.693 --> 48:27.746
And his great grandfather?

48:28.663 --> 48:32.484
- How do you know about that?
- The red headed girl told me.

48:36.137 --> 48:40.025
From what Joe told me, yeah, it's true.

48:41.008 --> 48:42.861
How'd she do it?

48:45.080 --> 48:48.333
Well, there's been many theories,
many stories.

48:51.852 --> 48:53.921
One time when Joe
was really drunk he told me...

48:54.021 --> 48:57.042
...that his dad had told him
what really happened.

49:00.928 --> 49:05.566
Alice and her sister were sold
to Joe's great grandfather...

49:05.666 --> 49:08.361
...by their uncle to help repay a debt.

49:09.370 --> 49:12.821
Eventually Alice's sister
got sold off to another guy.

49:14.409 --> 49:17.845
And after years and years
of being enslaved here...

49:17.945 --> 49:20.632
...Alice grew more and more defiant.

50:05.226 --> 50:07.679
Look at that delicate little rose over there.

50:08.496 --> 50:10.565
I bet she costs a sweet penny, huh?

50:10.665 --> 50:12.918
Sweet and a neat like a little bird.

50:14.469 --> 50:17.772
- But I like mine with some handle.
- I'll be collecting for all that grabbing.

50:17.872 --> 50:22.073
- You'll be collecting for more than that.
- Let me see how mean she really is.

50:32.853 --> 50:34.673
Hello, little lady.

50:36.724 --> 50:39.093
I said hello, little lady.

50:39.193 --> 50:41.028
Stupid whore!

50:41.128 --> 50:42.948
Chain her.

50:44.765 --> 50:48.039
Don't forget, I own you.

50:53.374 --> 50:56.652
I apologize. This visit is free.

50:58.179 --> 51:00.031
Thank you.

51:01.248 --> 51:03.551
Come on, baby, don't be sad.

51:03.751 --> 51:06.571
I'll take care of you. Let's go upstairs.

51:22.103 --> 51:24.742
You've got a full night's work. Unchain her.

53:16.183 --> 53:18.202
What a way to go.

53:18.786 --> 53:21.005
Pretty heavy stuff, huh?

53:27.728 --> 53:31.349
You must think I'm a real asshole
to be friends with him, huh?

53:32.700 --> 53:35.920
Yeah. Pretty much.

53:40.440 --> 53:42.460
You know I built that myself.

53:43.344 --> 53:45.146
You made this?

53:46.046 --> 53:47.600
No.

53:57.758 --> 54:00.594
Where are you going?
Snooping in Joe's underwear?

54:05.065 --> 54:08.143
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

54:08.836 --> 54:11.242
- I need to sit down.
- You okay?

54:11.342 --> 54:12.890
Yeah.

54:13.307 --> 54:15.250
- Do you feel weak?
- A little bit.

54:15.350 --> 54:17.161
Here, sit down.

54:19.880 --> 54:21.700
You okay?

54:26.987 --> 54:30.291
- What's wrong?
- I just feel kind of dizzy.

54:30.391 --> 54:32.877
All right, just rest. Rest.

54:37.031 --> 54:40.167
Yeah, this is the one. No, no, no, no.

54:40.267 --> 54:42.153
Mood lighting, baby.

54:43.304 --> 54:45.960
Why can't you keep that one on?
Just leave that one on.

54:46.060 --> 54:48.151
Okay, that's cool.

54:49.410 --> 54:50.962
Mmm.

54:58.018 --> 54:59.837
Oh, yeah.

55:24.511 --> 55:27.314
- What was that?
- What?

55:27.714 --> 55:29.689
Do you hear that?

55:29.789 --> 55:31.675
I didn't hear anything.

55:32.319 --> 55:34.172
Just relax.

55:54.274 --> 55:56.127
Do you hear that?

55:59.046 --> 56:00.915
I don't hear anything.

56:01.015 --> 56:03.101
Okay, just relax.

56:04.452 --> 56:07.321
- I feel so weird.
- You feel weird?

56:07.421 --> 56:09.240
It's the weed, baby.

56:32.012 --> 56:34.298
What the hell are you doing?

56:46.660 --> 56:50.515
I'm not gonna ask you any more questions
about why you're here. Okay?

56:51.532 --> 56:53.051
Thanks.

56:54.135 --> 56:55.953
No problem.

57:02.142 --> 57:04.412
Was that you screaming, Jennifer?

57:05.012 --> 57:08.950
Hey, don't use up all your energy.
Remember, it's my turn next.

57:09.050 --> 57:10.868
What do you mean?

57:11.418 --> 57:13.421
Whoo, yeah!

57:13.521 --> 57:15.890
Oh, yeah, baby!

57:15.990 --> 57:19.393
Oh, right there! Oh, yeah.

57:22.362 --> 57:24.215
You think they're screwing?

57:25.800 --> 57:27.685
We'll top 'em.

57:32.172 --> 57:34.038
We'll top 'em.

57:34.675 --> 57:37.095
- Nice work.
- Good prank.

57:38.412 --> 57:41.262
- You want a drink?
- Uh, yeah.

57:42.483 --> 57:45.119
Natasha. Natasha.

57:45.219 --> 57:48.306
- Where are you going?
- What's wrong?

57:49.690 --> 57:51.275
I'm...

57:53.794 --> 57:55.696
Are you seeing stuff?

57:55.796 --> 57:57.315
No.

57:58.733 --> 58:00.501
I think...

58:00.601 --> 58:03.891
...I think I just need
a cold bath or something.

58:04.271 --> 58:06.140
Oh, that's sexy.

58:06.540 --> 58:10.412
You know what, there's a nice bathtub.
You want me to run you a bath?

58:11.212 --> 58:15.428
- That sounds very nice.
- Yeah. Okay. Okay, let's do that.

58:18.318 --> 58:21.750
- Have fun, guys.
- Yeah, you too. Jesus.

58:23.057 --> 58:25.626
So, what are we gonna do?

58:25.726 --> 58:27.562
What do you wanna do?

58:27.662 --> 58:30.297
- Let's go upstairs.
- Let's go.

58:30.397 --> 58:32.282
You got it.

58:35.069 --> 58:38.356
- Do you believe in ghosts?
- Nope.

58:39.006 --> 58:40.975
Why not?

58:41.075 --> 58:43.494
I thought you said no more questions.

58:44.611 --> 58:46.497
I lied.

58:47.581 --> 58:49.599
Guess I can forgive you.

58:49.699 --> 58:52.753
- Thank you.
- Next question.

58:54.838 --> 58:56.706
Favorite color?

58:57.552 --> 59:00.161
Favorite color. Really?

59:01.145 --> 59:04.081
Come on, we gotta talk about something,
I'm not just gonna sit here in silence.

59:04.181 --> 59:07.602
Fine. Blue, I guess.

59:08.986 --> 59:10.787
Me too.

59:10.887 --> 59:12.740
You copycat.

59:12.857 --> 59:14.758
- Um...
- Copycat.

59:14.858 --> 59:16.661
Favorite...

59:16.761 --> 59:18.362
...food.

59:18.462 --> 59:21.682
Favorite food it's tough. Oh, it's tough.

59:22.299 --> 59:25.269
'Cause I got like pizza, chocolate, sushi...

59:25.369 --> 59:27.037
You have to pick one.

59:27.137 --> 59:30.440
- So you're making up the rules now?
- Mm-hmm.

59:30.540 --> 59:32.109
Sushi.

59:32.209 --> 59:33.894
Predictable.

59:34.145 --> 59:36.046
- I am not predictable.
- Yeah, you are.

59:36.146 --> 59:38.433
- Come on.
- You are so predictable.

59:39.350 --> 59:40.885
Okay.

59:41.185 --> 59:42.786
Try me.

59:42.886 --> 59:45.055
All right. All right.

59:45.155 --> 59:46.740
Okay.

59:47.958 --> 59:50.660
You're parents are happily married...

59:50.760 --> 59:55.099
...you've got three strapping brothers
who are your best friends.

59:55.199 --> 59:58.936
You're mom's a homemaker, dad's a lawyer...

59:59.036 --> 01:00:01.205
...and mommy loved to make
her growing boys peach pie...

01:00:01.305 --> 01:00:03.185
...on the weekends.

01:00:03.875 --> 01:00:05.442
Stop.

01:00:05.542 --> 01:00:07.428
Just stop.

01:00:09.646 --> 01:00:11.232
No.

01:00:12.483 --> 01:00:14.067
No.

01:00:14.718 --> 01:00:18.184
Actually, my parents got divorced
when I was nine.

01:00:19.456 --> 01:00:21.910
My dad is a lawyer, you got that right.

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:25.579
But he moved to Chicago...

01:00:26.596 --> 01:00:31.814
...married his 20 year younger secretary
and now has a new family.

01:00:33.437 --> 01:00:37.942
I have an older and a younger sister,
and my mom's an elementary school teacher.

01:00:38.042 --> 01:00:41.055
And I have never had peach pie.

01:00:45.216 --> 01:00:47.051
Do you ever see him?

01:00:47.151 --> 01:00:49.437
- My dad?
- Mm-hmm.

01:00:50.354 --> 01:00:52.239
Not really.

01:00:54.424 --> 01:00:56.277
We don't have much in common.

01:00:59.929 --> 01:01:01.698
How about you?

01:01:01.798 --> 01:01:04.268
My favorite food of all time.

01:01:04.368 --> 01:01:07.855
It's easy, my grandma's Irish cooking.

01:01:08.805 --> 01:01:12.943
Stew with potatoes and carrots
and lamb, brown bread...

01:01:13.043 --> 01:01:14.863
I meant your family.

01:01:15.712 --> 01:01:17.565
It takes me back.

01:01:19.816 --> 01:01:21.869
Is your grandma around anymore?

01:01:23.087 --> 01:01:24.939
No one's around anymore.

01:01:26.223 --> 01:01:31.307
It's just myself and my younger sister,
and she's eight.

01:01:35.932 --> 01:01:37.752
She's why you're here.

01:01:41.171 --> 01:01:42.723
Yeah.

01:01:44.875 --> 01:01:49.063
My dad, he left after our mom died.

01:01:49.163 --> 01:01:54.419
My grandma, she passed
last year so it's just us.

01:01:55.019 --> 01:01:58.389
And when I work I have to find someone to
stay with her which doesn't always happen.

01:01:58.489 --> 01:02:02.751
So it's hard to go to school,
pay for school, keep a steady job...

01:02:02.851 --> 01:02:05.138
...take care of her and make ends meet.

01:02:07.864 --> 01:02:11.135
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be.

01:02:11.635 --> 01:02:13.921
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.

01:02:15.506 --> 01:02:18.379
I'll do whatever I have to do
to take care of her.

01:02:23.046 --> 01:02:25.049
I shouldn't have judged you.

01:02:25.149 --> 01:02:26.967
It's no biggie.

01:02:34.624 --> 01:02:36.627
Is that why you don't believe in ghosts?

01:02:36.827 --> 01:02:40.830
- What do you mean?
- You mom and your grandma.

01:02:40.930 --> 01:02:43.551
Yeah, I guess. I mean...

01:02:44.084 --> 01:02:46.556
...they'd come to me if they could, right?

01:02:47.538 --> 01:02:49.089
Yeah.

01:02:50.441 --> 01:02:52.326
Maybe, I don't know.

01:02:53.310 --> 01:02:58.249
I feel like maybe spirits get stuck
sometimes. Like if they really want to...

01:02:58.349 --> 01:03:02.157
I don't want to talk about it anymore, okay?

01:03:02.553 --> 01:03:04.104
Yeah.

01:03:04.358 --> 01:03:05.906
Yeah.

01:03:15.832 --> 01:03:17.902
You're not gonna sleep with them.

01:03:21.838 --> 01:03:23.724
Unless you want to.

01:03:26.343 --> 01:03:27.862
Hmm.

01:03:28.412 --> 01:03:30.298
You're not really my type.

01:03:31.898 --> 01:03:33.401
Good.

01:03:58.409 --> 01:04:00.244
I'll be right there, baby.

01:04:00.844 --> 01:04:03.130
Yeah, yeah.

01:04:44.521 --> 01:04:46.340
It's killer weed.

01:04:47.291 --> 01:04:49.176
Proud of you.

01:05:26.230 --> 01:05:27.748
Boop.

01:05:29.099 --> 01:05:30.951
Hi, ladies.

01:05:32.469 --> 01:05:33.904
Hey.

01:05:34.004 --> 01:05:35.823
Get in there.

01:06:50.014 --> 01:06:51.599
Wait, wait.

01:06:59.290 --> 01:07:01.090
Goddamn.

01:07:33.022 --> 01:07:34.875
Hey, wake up.

01:07:49.238 --> 01:07:51.241
- Hey.
- Hmm?

01:07:51.341 --> 01:07:53.760
Come on. Come here.

01:08:03.553 --> 01:08:05.830
Hey, guys, don't mess around.

01:08:13.963 --> 01:08:15.683
Assholes.

01:09:14.073 --> 01:09:15.926
Here we go.

01:09:43.502 --> 01:09:45.058
Careful.

01:10:25.145 --> 01:10:26.947
Hey, Miguel.

01:10:27.047 --> 01:10:30.313
- We're busy.
- Hey, man, you want a drink?

01:10:30.413 --> 01:10:33.986
No, we're busy. Find another hoe.

01:10:34.086 --> 01:10:35.973
You're not a hoe.

01:10:37.357 --> 01:10:38.942
Okay.

01:10:44.597 --> 01:10:46.683
What are they doing out there?

01:10:48.601 --> 01:10:51.905
Joe and Adam,
they get a little crazy sometimes.

01:10:52.005 --> 01:10:54.208
They've been really loud.

01:10:54.308 --> 01:10:56.327
I feel so messed up.

01:10:57.344 --> 01:10:59.178
I feel great.

01:10:59.578 --> 01:11:04.200
No, I think we're like really messed up,
Michael. The room is, like, moving.

01:11:04.951 --> 01:11:06.803
It is moving.

01:11:11.489 --> 01:11:13.544
What a freaking party.

01:11:21.134 --> 01:11:22.986
What was that?

01:11:23.803 --> 01:11:25.272
Sorry.

01:11:25.372 --> 01:11:27.190
Don't be.

01:11:44.158 --> 01:11:46.180
Natasha.

01:11:50.230 --> 01:11:52.251
Natasha.

01:11:55.935 --> 01:11:57.989
Natasha.

01:12:01.575 --> 01:12:04.815
- Natasha!
- No! No!

01:12:35.992 --> 01:12:37.527
Joe.

01:12:38.511 --> 01:12:40.380
Hey, man.

01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:42.299
Hey, what the hell.

01:12:43.082 --> 01:12:44.884
Hey, hey.

01:12:44.984 --> 01:12:46.787
I don't know what's going on.

01:12:47.287 --> 01:12:49.389
- There's...
- Where's Anita?

01:12:49.489 --> 01:12:51.774
I don't know. I don't know.

01:12:57.164 --> 01:12:59.222
Natasha.

01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:09.260
Natasha.

01:13:35.435 --> 01:13:38.105
- Where's Anita?
- We were in the tub...

01:13:38.605 --> 01:13:41.441
...and then there was this... this...

01:13:41.941 --> 01:13:45.384
Oh, God! No! No!

01:13:45.484 --> 01:13:47.113
Help.

01:13:47.347 --> 01:13:49.365
Leave me alone.

01:13:51.884 --> 01:13:53.904
Leave me alone.

01:14:08.035 --> 01:14:10.087
What the hell are you doing?

01:14:12.639 --> 01:14:14.490
What the hell are you doing?

01:14:15.508 --> 01:14:17.393
What are you doing, man?

01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:45.004
Have you lost your mind, huh?

01:15:01.854 --> 01:15:03.723
What's going on down here?

01:15:04.223 --> 01:15:06.693
What the hell happened? What happened, huh?

01:15:06.793 --> 01:15:08.311
Zeke!

01:15:16.536 --> 01:15:19.358
Jennifer! Run!

01:15:51.037 --> 01:15:52.972
I own you, whore.

01:15:53.072 --> 01:15:56.594
Joe, come to me, Joe.

01:16:02.582 --> 01:16:04.149
Joe...

01:16:05.278 --> 01:16:07.335
...come to me.
