00:02.234 --> 00:04.268
Hello. Anybody home?

00:04.269 --> 00:06.104
Tim?
Under here.

00:06.105 --> 00:07.606
Oh.

00:07.607 --> 00:10.842
I picked up my application
to graduate school.

00:10.843 --> 00:12.911
You know what?
I have to write an essay

00:12.912 --> 00:15.113
On why I think I'd make
a good psychologist.

00:15.114 --> 00:17.115
Well, that's easy.

00:17.116 --> 00:18.783
Tell them you're the kind
of person that will

00:18.784 --> 00:21.720
Give people advice
whether they want it or not.

00:21.721 --> 00:24.455
Thank you so...
What are you doing?

00:24.456 --> 00:26.858
I just put a little attachment
on your garbage disposal.

00:26.859 --> 00:29.160
Don't touch that!
It's working fine.

00:29.161 --> 00:31.796
It's working fine if you want
to grind up normal stuff,

00:31.797 --> 00:34.298
Which it doesn't do
that well anyway,
but I got a vision.

00:34.299 --> 00:36.134
I'm talking
about real stuff -

00:36.135 --> 00:39.838
Whole corn on the cob
with the husk included.

00:39.839 --> 00:43.274
Avocado pits? Heck,
avocado trees ought
to go down this thing.

00:44.744 --> 00:47.746
Other tool guys ask, "why?"

00:47.747 --> 00:50.949
This tool man asks,
"why not?"

00:50.950 --> 00:55.720
This tool man's wife asks,
"why me?"

00:55.721 --> 00:57.588
I'll show you why, you.

00:57.589 --> 01:00.424
Just in case you need
extra power.

01:00.425 --> 01:02.260
<i>(motor revving)</i>

01:02.261 --> 01:04.796
<i>(motor roaring)</i>

02:09.195 --> 02:11.495
Thank you.

02:11.496 --> 02:13.765
Hey, al, I wish you'd
stop cleaning, you know.

02:13.766 --> 02:16.300
You're a partner,
not a janitor.

02:16.301 --> 02:18.302
I know, but I don't mind.

02:18.303 --> 02:20.238
See, I feel
a tidy hardware store

02:20.239 --> 02:22.440
Is a successful
hardware store.

02:22.441 --> 02:24.042
Isn't that your philosophy?

02:24.043 --> 02:26.544
In a nutshell.

02:29.314 --> 02:30.949
Hey, harry.
Hey, timmy!

02:30.950 --> 02:32.683
Hi, al.
Hey, tim. How are you?

02:32.684 --> 02:34.452
Pretty good, buddy.
All right.

02:34.453 --> 02:36.921
All right.

02:36.922 --> 02:38.623
So what can I do
for you?

02:38.624 --> 02:40.424
I need a spark plug
for my garbage disposal.

02:40.425 --> 02:43.828
You put a gas engine
in your disposal?

02:43.829 --> 02:45.463
You got a problem
with that?

02:45.464 --> 02:47.766
Are you gonna race it
against the other disposals?

02:50.469 --> 02:51.636
Benny.

02:51.637 --> 02:53.304
Hey, everybody.
Hey, tim, how you doing?

02:53.305 --> 02:55.473
Benny, how are you?
Hi, al.

02:59.011 --> 03:00.812
Can you guys loan me
a space heater?

03:00.813 --> 03:02.313
What for?

03:02.314 --> 03:04.415
The furnace in my new
residence has a gas leak.

03:04.416 --> 03:06.251
I don't have the means
to get it fixed.

03:06.252 --> 03:08.352
What kind of dump
are you living in now?

03:08.353 --> 03:11.256
For your edification,
it's an eight-room house.

03:11.257 --> 03:13.258
One room, I'm not sure
what it is.

03:13.259 --> 03:15.059
It's got a lot
of books in it.

03:17.830 --> 03:20.531
The bathroom.

03:20.532 --> 03:23.367
You can't afford
an eight-room house.

03:23.368 --> 03:26.570
True, but my beloved
aunt is in florida
for a few months.

03:26.571 --> 03:29.607
And while the aunt's away,
the nephew will stay.

03:29.608 --> 03:31.709
My guess is he won't pay.

03:33.112 --> 03:35.947
And I'm covered
till may.

03:35.948 --> 03:39.250
Hey, a leaky gas valve
can be very dangerous.

03:39.251 --> 03:40.952
That's right, benny.
It really is.

03:40.953 --> 03:43.654
Relax. It was shut off
weeks ago, the gas.

03:43.655 --> 03:46.424
So that means you don't
have any hot water?

03:46.425 --> 03:48.960
That means
you can't take a shower?

03:51.463 --> 03:54.299
Not to worry. I boil
the water on my hot plate

03:54.300 --> 03:57.001
And give myself
a nightly sponge bath.

03:57.002 --> 04:01.206
Makes you glad
you're not a sponge, huh?

04:01.207 --> 04:03.741
Wait a minute.
We could help him out.

04:03.742 --> 04:06.077
Why don't we take
a <i>tool time</i> crew over there
and fix the furnace

04:06.078 --> 04:08.412
For that heating and cooling
special we're doing
on the show?

04:08.413 --> 04:09.714
That's a good idea.

04:09.715 --> 04:11.883
And, tim, you yourself
would do the repairs?

04:11.884 --> 04:14.585
Yeah.
Forget it.

04:14.586 --> 04:16.286
It's free.
I'm in.

04:16.288 --> 04:17.454
Ha ha ha.

04:17.456 --> 04:19.423
Um, we can schedule
this Monday morning early.

04:19.423 --> 04:20.925
You gotta be there
about 6am.

04:20.926 --> 04:24.162
Monday's no good for me.
I got my gamblers
anonymous meeting.

04:24.163 --> 04:25.830
Well, how about Tuesday?

04:25.831 --> 04:28.599
Also no good.
I'm going to the track.

04:33.973 --> 04:36.774
Does everybody know
what time it is?

04:36.775 --> 04:39.110
<i>Tool time.</i>

04:39.111 --> 04:41.279
That's right. Binford tools
is on location

04:41.280 --> 04:43.781
With tim
"the tool man" taylor.

04:43.782 --> 04:45.783
Thank you, heidi.
I'm tim "the tool man" taylor,

04:45.784 --> 04:47.752
And you all know
my assistant, al borland.

04:47.753 --> 04:50.955
We're here on location
at the barony home.

04:50.956 --> 04:54.225
Our project today
is fixing a gas furnace.

04:54.226 --> 04:57.929
If we have time,
maybe we'll fix this
broken windowpane,

04:57.930 --> 05:02.500
Maybe put on some new gutters,
maybe some new shutters.

05:02.501 --> 05:04.435
Maybe we'll do a tv show.

05:04.436 --> 05:06.504
Maybe we'll call it
<i>tool time.</i>

05:06.505 --> 05:08.172
Maybe I'll be the host

05:08.173 --> 05:11.276
And you'll be
the humorless assistant.

05:11.277 --> 05:13.278
Maybe.

05:13.279 --> 05:16.948
But first we should get
to our leaky gas valve
in the furnace.

05:16.949 --> 05:18.416
With any kind of gas leak,

05:18.417 --> 05:20.484
You wanna make sure you shut
the gas off to the home.

05:20.485 --> 05:22.586
The gas has been turned off
on this house.

05:22.587 --> 05:24.789
Heidi here will show you
how that was done.

05:24.790 --> 05:26.791
You're gonna take
your crescent wrench

05:26.792 --> 05:28.960
And you're gonna turn
the valve a quarter turn,

05:28.961 --> 05:31.529
So that the wrench
is perpendicular
to your pipe.

05:31.530 --> 05:33.364
Thank you, heidi.
You're welcome, tim.

05:33.365 --> 05:36.935
Now, let's go take
a peek at our leak.
Watch your step, buddy.

05:36.936 --> 05:39.270
Speaking of peeks,
aren't those drawers
a little tight on you, al?

05:44.243 --> 05:45.944
Oh! Oh!

05:49.581 --> 05:52.383
Well, here we are
in the basement.

05:52.384 --> 05:54.118
Good observation, al.

05:54.119 --> 05:55.954
Maybe tomorrow
you can tell the people

05:55.955 --> 05:59.123
What that big room upstairs is
with the stove in it.

05:59.124 --> 06:01.426
Oh, gosh,
I'll tell you!

06:01.427 --> 06:03.561
All right. Fixing that
leaky valve involves

06:03.562 --> 06:05.997
Taking the plate off
this old furnace here.

06:05.998 --> 06:08.399
Sometimes these old furnaces
are tough, you know.

06:08.400 --> 06:11.902
You gotta... Oh, boy!

06:11.903 --> 06:15.239
When they're old like this,
you gotta really...

06:15.240 --> 06:17.108
<i>(grunts)</i>

06:24.416 --> 06:26.951
Yeah, right.
After I loosened it
for you.

06:26.952 --> 06:29.420
Marv, if you get down here,
we'll find that gas valve.

06:29.421 --> 06:31.255
In these old ones,
they're way back
and they're hard to see

06:31.256 --> 06:35.526
'cause sometimes they're...
Right there in front of you.

06:35.527 --> 06:37.728
There's that pesky
little devil, right there.

06:37.729 --> 06:40.064
Now, the first thing
we wanna do

06:40.065 --> 06:42.166
Is loosen up
the flexible connector

06:42.167 --> 06:44.602
With a 7/8 inch wrench.
All right.

06:44.603 --> 06:47.638
Then you wanna loosen
the module control
wires, here.

06:47.639 --> 06:52.477
Then you wanna loosen up
al with a stiff martini.

06:52.478 --> 06:55.146
Simply unscrew the old
gas valve like that.

06:55.147 --> 06:57.848
Now we're ready
for the new one.

06:57.849 --> 06:59.517
However,
before we put this in,

06:59.518 --> 07:02.520
We want to seal the valve
at both the gas inlet
and outlet.

07:02.521 --> 07:05.056
And for that we need
a special compound
known as plumber's dope.

07:05.057 --> 07:06.757
Tim, where's
the plumber's dope?

07:06.758 --> 07:09.827
<i>(silly voice)</i>
it's right here.
Ha ha ha ha!

07:09.828 --> 07:12.497
Sorry I'm late.
Hi, al.

07:12.498 --> 07:16.134
Sorry I'm late.
I thought the basement
was upstairs.

07:16.135 --> 07:19.937
Ha ha ha.

07:19.938 --> 07:22.573
All right.
Well, once you've applied
the plumber's dope,

07:22.574 --> 07:24.575
We'll put on
our new gas valve,

07:24.576 --> 07:26.877
And we're ready
to reconnect the wiring.

07:26.878 --> 07:29.247
All right.
We've reconnected the wiring.

07:29.248 --> 07:32.083
Now all we have to do
is reconnect al.

07:34.086 --> 07:36.954
We've reconnected al.
Now let's see if
the furnace is working.

07:36.955 --> 07:39.790
For that, let's go to heidi
and the gas cam.

07:39.791 --> 07:43.461
Heidi? My gas, please.
There you go, tim.

07:43.462 --> 07:45.263
All right.

07:45.264 --> 07:47.765
We bypassed the thermostat
upstairs with this
little switch here.

07:47.766 --> 07:50.701
Flick her on.
See if she goes.

07:50.702 --> 07:53.604
All ready to go.
Now just put
the panel back on.

07:53.605 --> 07:56.107
Yeah. Now, if you still
have a problem,

07:56.108 --> 07:58.676
There's many possibilities
that...

08:16.295 --> 08:17.895
These old furnaces
sometimes are tough.

08:17.896 --> 08:19.464
They put...

08:21.200 --> 08:23.201
Well, that's all the time
we have for today's show.

08:23.202 --> 08:25.803
Catch us next time
when we do our salute...

08:25.804 --> 08:28.739
"hey, you big lug!
You left the seat up again."

08:28.740 --> 08:30.808
<i>(both)</i> ...To toilets.

08:33.912 --> 08:35.913
Hey, that was a really
great show, al.

08:35.914 --> 08:37.248
Thank you, heidi.

08:37.249 --> 08:38.916
You know, on these
location <i>tool times,</i>

08:38.917 --> 08:41.251
I feel the audience really
gets to see the real al.

08:41.253 --> 08:43.254
If you don't zip up
your fly, the real al's

08:43.255 --> 08:45.923
Gonna make a personal
appearance.

08:48.127 --> 08:49.760
Finish those doughnuts
in a hurry, all right?

08:49.761 --> 08:51.095
The truck's
almost packed up.

08:51.096 --> 08:52.430
No problem.
All right.

08:53.865 --> 08:55.966
Uh, excuse me.

08:55.967 --> 08:57.635
I'm from across the street.

08:57.636 --> 09:00.304
You're on that show,
<i>tool time,</i> aren't you?

09:00.305 --> 09:01.672
Yes, we are.

09:01.673 --> 09:04.542
You know, you're just
as attractive in real life.

09:04.543 --> 09:07.911
Thank you.
I try to stay fit.

09:07.912 --> 09:09.614
I was talking to her.

09:10.649 --> 09:12.383
Thank you.
You're welcome.

09:12.384 --> 09:16.454
So, uh, what brings you
to the neighborhood?

09:16.455 --> 09:19.357
Oh, we just fixed the leak
in mrs. Barony's furnace.

09:19.358 --> 09:20.791
Oh, good.
Yeah.

09:20.792 --> 09:22.360
What about the leak
in the stove?

09:22.361 --> 09:24.562
Well, we're, uh... Uh...

09:24.563 --> 09:27.131
The stove?

09:27.132 --> 09:30.368
That's why she shut off
the gas before she left
for florida.

09:33.872 --> 09:35.306
Benny!

09:37.576 --> 09:39.577
Did your aunt
happen to mention

09:39.578 --> 09:41.479
That there's also
a gas leak in the stove?

09:41.480 --> 09:43.514
Maybe. It's hard
to understand her

09:43.515 --> 09:46.350
When she's not wearing
her teeth.

09:46.351 --> 09:48.085
You realize there's
the possibility

09:48.086 --> 09:50.221
That gas has been leaking
into this house
for the last half hour?

09:50.222 --> 09:52.423
The slightest spark
could cause combustion.

09:52.424 --> 09:54.158
Take it easy.

09:54.159 --> 09:57.161
I disconnected all
the electrical appliances
like you told me.

09:57.162 --> 09:59.230
Good.
Except that lamp
over there.

09:59.231 --> 10:02.233
But don't worry.
It's the kind that only
goes on when you clap.

10:02.234 --> 10:05.203
Come on, guys.
Let's go.

10:07.105 --> 10:09.907
<i>(all scream)</i>

10:21.152 --> 10:23.954
Let me guess.
There was another leak?

10:23.955 --> 10:25.789
The stove.
Benny!

10:29.428 --> 10:33.264
<i>(all shout)</i>

10:33.265 --> 10:35.065
Everybody, shut up!

10:37.068 --> 10:39.437
I'll have to get back
to you. Guys!

10:39.438 --> 10:42.840
Hey, there's no doughnuts.

10:42.841 --> 10:44.342
And you didn't buy
any more?

10:44.343 --> 10:46.344
Did it ever occur to you

10:46.345 --> 10:47.945
That I might not have time

10:47.946 --> 10:49.980
To fulfill
all your snacking needs

10:49.981 --> 10:53.217
Because there might be
something more important
going on in my life?

10:53.218 --> 10:55.085
Yeah, right.

10:57.656 --> 11:00.758
I'm trying to finish
my application
to graduate school.

11:00.759 --> 11:02.760
I thought you were already
in graduate school.

11:02.761 --> 11:04.027
<i>(both)</i> me too.

11:04.028 --> 11:05.696
I can't believe you guys.

11:05.697 --> 11:10.000
I've been taking undergraduate
courses since September.

11:10.001 --> 11:12.336
You have no idea what I've
been doing in school?

11:12.337 --> 11:15.573
Well, your teacher
didn't send home any notes.

11:18.009 --> 11:21.612
We assumed
everything was fine.

11:21.613 --> 11:24.482
Look, if you're not gonna
care about my life,

11:24.483 --> 11:28.051
Would you just not care
about my life quietly
for a few days?

11:28.052 --> 11:30.821
You got it, mom.

11:30.822 --> 11:32.956
That's just how I see it,
all right?

11:32.957 --> 11:35.526
I don't care what you say.
You blew up my house.

11:35.527 --> 11:37.295
I didn't blow up
your house.

11:37.296 --> 11:39.897
Who clapped?

11:39.898 --> 11:41.799
I've clapped
a million times.

11:41.800 --> 11:43.768
It's probably the one thing
I've done that hasn't
caused an explosion.

11:43.769 --> 11:46.136
Till now.
Hey, guys, can you
keep it down, please?

11:46.137 --> 11:47.471
<i>(tim)</i> yeah, yeah.
Come on, benny.

11:47.472 --> 11:49.507
Hiya, roomie.

11:55.847 --> 11:57.748
I beg your pardon?

11:57.749 --> 12:00.418
Didn't I tell you
I was gonna tell her?

12:00.419 --> 12:03.287
Tim blew up my house.
Need I say more?

12:03.288 --> 12:06.256
I didn't blow up your house.
I didn't blow up his house.

12:06.257 --> 12:08.426
There was a gas leak
at his aunt's house.

12:08.427 --> 12:10.093
We tried to fix it,
and there was an explosion.

12:10.094 --> 12:11.696
Oh, benny, I'm so sorry.

12:11.697 --> 12:16.099
So I said until we figure out
what we should do,

12:16.100 --> 12:19.236
He should <i>stay... Here.</i>

12:21.506 --> 12:23.273
Don't worry.

12:23.274 --> 12:25.943
Tim said he's gonna fix up
the house better than new.

12:25.944 --> 12:28.479
And I won't be an imposition.
You won't even know I'm here.

12:28.480 --> 12:31.048
Exactly how long won't we
know that you're here?

12:31.049 --> 12:32.783
A couple of days.
Indefinitely.

Yeah. He says when I'm 12,

He's gonna take me to vegas

13:31.576 --> 13:34.945
Why did his house
have to blow up?

13:34.946 --> 13:37.915
Ask mr. Claphappy.

13:41.586 --> 13:43.654
I didn't blow up the house.

13:43.655 --> 13:46.223
Tim, you gotta find him
another place to stay.

13:46.224 --> 13:48.392
I've tried to find him
another place to stay.

13:48.393 --> 13:50.928
Harry won't take him.
He just laughed at me
and hung up the phone.

13:50.929 --> 13:54.064
I even called some sisters.
They hung up on me.

13:54.065 --> 13:56.366
His own sisters
won't take him in?

13:56.367 --> 13:58.135
No, no, no. I'm talking
about the sisters

13:58.136 --> 14:00.471

That's my bathrobe.

14:10.181 --> 14:13.183
I should've known.
It feels so soft
against my body.

14:16.254 --> 14:17.621
I'll put it back.

14:54.325 --> 14:58.362
Benny barony
doing pelvic thrusts.

Whoa. I hope for his sake
he doesn't get stuck
in that position.

15:03.201 --> 15:06.737
Hey. How would you like
to have a roommate
for a little while?

15:06.738 --> 15:09.840
Oh, no, tim.
These days I prefer
the solitary lifestyle.

15:09.841 --> 15:11.509
He's great. You'd love benny.

15:11.510 --> 15:14.979
After his 12 square meals
a day, he's happy as a clam.

15:14.980 --> 15:17.014
Well, you seem to be
in quite a hurry

15:17.015 --> 15:19.783
To unload
your crony barony.

15:19.784 --> 15:22.820
He's driving
my family crazy.

15:22.821 --> 15:24.922
But how do you
kick a good friend out?

15:24.923 --> 15:28.058
Mm-hmm. Especially after
you blew up his house.

15:28.059 --> 15:31.261
I didn't blow up
the man's house.

15:31.262 --> 15:33.731
When does he move back in?

15:33.732 --> 15:37.234
It'll take al and I
a couple of weeks
to fix that house.

15:37.235 --> 15:38.936
I got a problem.

15:38.937 --> 15:40.738
You know, you wouldn't
have a problem

15:40.739 --> 15:43.407
If you were
an african buffalo weaver.

15:43.408 --> 15:46.844
No kidding. I'd be in africa
weaving a buffalo.

15:46.845 --> 15:48.445
No, no, no, tim.

15:48.446 --> 15:50.614
See, buffalo weavers
are birds who nest
communally.

15:50.615 --> 15:52.282
Then when
the nest is damaged,

15:52.283 --> 15:54.284
Instead of one bird spending
months trying to fix it,

15:54.285 --> 15:57.421
Eight to ten birds
working together can
rebuild it in no time.

15:57.422 --> 15:59.423
Perfect. Perfect.
I've just gotta find

15:59.424 --> 16:02.059
A sparrow that spackles,
a duck that can dry-wall,

16:02.060 --> 16:05.729
And use some
plaster of parrots.

16:05.730 --> 16:08.331
No, what I'm saying is
maybe you should try to find

16:08.332 --> 16:10.834
Some birds of your
own feather.

16:10.835 --> 16:13.437
Hey. Oh-ho-ho!

16:15.339 --> 16:17.575
It'd be tough finding a duck
who knew how to dry-wall.

16:17.576 --> 16:19.076
And who can afford
a union duck?

16:19.077 --> 16:21.344
Their bill is enormous.

16:24.883 --> 16:27.818
Come on, hustle up!
Come on! Come on! Come on!

16:27.819 --> 16:31.354
Dad, why did we have
to get up at five
in the morning?

16:31.355 --> 16:34.091
Because we're gonna do
a little building today.
Wilson and heidi on wiring,

16:34.092 --> 16:35.593
Al and harry,
dry-wall and carpeting,

16:35.594 --> 16:37.227
You guys are painting,
and mom and I on windows.

16:37.228 --> 16:39.930
Why do I have to go?

16:39.931 --> 16:44.101
Think about it.
The faster we get
benny into his house,

16:44.102 --> 16:47.104
The faster we get him
out of our house.

16:47.105 --> 16:50.173
Ok, everybody. Move it.
Let's go. Let's go.

16:50.174 --> 16:52.676
Come on. Hyah! Hyah!
All right, move it. Move it.

16:55.880 --> 16:57.380
Comfy, benny?

16:57.381 --> 16:59.549
I could use
a throw pillow.

17:01.119 --> 17:02.552
Hey, wilson.

17:02.553 --> 17:04.088
Hi-ho, tim.

17:07.092 --> 17:08.391
Having fun, guys?

17:08.392 --> 17:10.661
Oh, it's a dream
come true.

17:10.662 --> 17:13.763
12 straight hours
of fixing a house
that you barbecued.

17:13.765 --> 17:15.799
I didn't blow up
this house.

19:16.087 --> 19:18.455
I don't think
that this whole day

19:18.456 --> 19:20.991
We had one argument with all
this fixing and building.

19:20.992 --> 19:24.561
That's 'cause we're like
sparrows that can spackle
from buffalo.

19:24.562 --> 19:25.929
What?

19:25.930 --> 19:28.165
What's important is that
we're good at this.

19:28.166 --> 19:29.733
We should get
a contractor's license,

19:29.734 --> 19:31.769
And go on the road
and do odd jobs for people.

19:31.770 --> 19:34.437
Cool. We'd be together
24 hours a day.
