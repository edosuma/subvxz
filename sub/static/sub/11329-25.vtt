WEBVTT

00:03.126 --> 00:04.556
We're getting
married Friday night.

00:04.885 --> 00:06.085
But we should be
back to school

00:06.110 --> 00:07.310
bright and early
Monday morning.

00:07.335 --> 00:09.132
Can't let a little thing
like a wedding

00:09.133 --> 00:10.048
keep us from school.

00:10.073 --> 00:12.081
No, or a baby.

00:12.106 --> 00:14.693
Are you actually asking me
if Mom's seeing someone?

00:14.718 --> 00:15.878
She's seeing Josh. Isn't she?

00:15.903 --> 00:17.294
Oh, Dad, don't do this.

00:18.850 --> 00:20.745
I really want you to go
to my friend's wedding with me.

00:20.770 --> 00:21.712
I don't want to go.

00:21.737 --> 00:22.760
Why? Do you think
I might get ideas?

00:22.785 --> 00:23.985
About marriage?

00:24.057 --> 00:26.030
I need you to go
to the wedding with me.

00:26.060 --> 00:27.700
How many dinners
and fundraisers

00:27.705 --> 00:29.408
and events have you dragged
me to over the years?

00:29.472 --> 00:32.140
As I recall, you always said,
"Maybe I'll meet someone."

00:32.141 --> 00:33.609
And maybe I did.

00:33.610 --> 00:35.444
I never realized how much
I love you

00:35.445 --> 00:37.312
and how much I wanted
to be with you.

00:37.313 --> 00:39.948
What made you realize that? Your dad?
Yeah.

00:39.949 --> 00:41.917
'Cause he likes me better than Grace.
So do I.

00:41.918 --> 00:43.785
You didn't tell me
you got into a college.

00:43.786 --> 00:46.154
You had pictured the three of us
living above the butcher shop

00:46.155 --> 00:47.956
while I worked
and you went to school?

00:47.957 --> 00:49.791
I can adjust that picture.

00:49.792 --> 00:52.027
We are gathered here today
to join

00:52.028 --> 00:54.930
Ben and Adrian
in holy matrimony.

00:54.931 --> 00:56.832
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

00:56.833 --> 00:58.734
You may kiss the bride.

01:00.870 --> 01:02.538
You know, Mr. Boykewich,

01:02.539 --> 01:04.406
what I was thinking
we could do,

01:04.407 --> 01:06.441
after you get home
from the butcher shop

01:06.442 --> 01:08.710
and we go to
Dr. Attavi's office--

01:08.711 --> 01:11.446
we can go by the market
and get some steaks

01:11.447 --> 01:14.016
and then try the grill
on the patio.

01:14.017 --> 01:15.951
What do you think?

01:20.757 --> 01:23.191
Oh, I think it's 4:30,

01:23.192 --> 01:24.726
and it's too early,

01:24.727 --> 01:27.796
and you need your sleep,
Mrs. Boykewich.

01:28.865 --> 01:31.633
I can't sleep.
I'm uncomfortable.

01:31.634 --> 01:33.735
I'm getting more uncomfortable
by the minute.

01:35.538 --> 01:37.573
He said for you
to lie on your left side.

01:37.574 --> 01:40.842
I was, but I'm not comfortable
on my left side.

01:40.843 --> 01:42.778
I'm tired of my left side.

01:42.779 --> 01:45.380
My right side's no good,
and I don't have another side,

01:45.381 --> 01:47.316
so I sat up.

01:51.454 --> 01:54.423
Well, short of
giving birth immediately,

01:54.424 --> 01:56.625
what do you think might help?

01:56.626 --> 01:58.927
Because until
you're comfortable,

01:58.928 --> 02:01.063
I have a feeling
I'm not going to be comfortable,

02:01.064 --> 02:03.799
so I'd be willing
to do just about anything.

02:03.800 --> 02:05.801
You name it.
I don't know.

02:05.802 --> 02:07.469
Maybe when we go see
Dr. Attavi today,

02:07.470 --> 02:10.205
he can suggest something.

02:10.205 --> 02:12.474
Oh, maybe I could call Amy.

02:12.475 --> 02:14.009
Maybe she could
be useful for once.

02:14.010 --> 02:15.844
At 4:30?

02:15.845 --> 02:18.347
You think she's up?

02:18.348 --> 02:21.350
Maybe with John?
She could be up.

02:21.351 --> 02:24.820
I doubt it.
But...

02:24.821 --> 02:28.023
I'm up now,

02:28.024 --> 02:30.959
so what can I do for you?

02:30.960 --> 02:32.728
You hungry?

02:32.729 --> 02:35.497
You must be hungry.
You woke up thinking about steaks.

02:35.498 --> 02:38.533
Which, by the way, I'll bring
home from the butcher shop.

02:38.534 --> 02:40.235
You want some breakfast?

02:40.236 --> 02:41.737
Do we have breakfast food?

02:41.738 --> 02:45.140
We do.
We have eggs

02:45.141 --> 02:48.210
and milk and bread.

02:48.211 --> 02:50.579
I think I can do something
with that that would be edible.

02:50.580 --> 02:52.748
Yeah. Okay. Thanks.

02:52.749 --> 02:54.216
I'd love some breakfast.

02:54.217 --> 02:56.551
As long as it doesn't
make us late for school.

02:56.552 --> 02:58.020
We have a few hours.

02:58.021 --> 02:59.921
Thank you, Husband.
You're welcome, Wife.

And you thought this would
be a good idea because?

04:04.596 --> 04:06.430
Because they're trying to do
what they think is right,

04:06.431 --> 04:09.299
and I think that's honorable, and
I think we should all support them.

04:09.300 --> 04:11.468
Mm-hmm. See,
they should've thought

04:11.469 --> 04:13.971
about doing the right thing when
they were doing the wrong thing.

04:13.972 --> 04:15.305
Now, I could support that.

04:15.306 --> 04:16.906
Yeah, but they--
Yeah, me, too.

04:16.908 --> 04:19.041
Really, what are
these girls thinking?

04:19.043 --> 04:21.712
That that's a way to get a guy to
marry them-- by getting pregnant?

04:21.713 --> 04:24.948
It's like we're rewarding them for
doing something stupid, Kaitlyn.

04:26.050 --> 04:27.684
Uh, excuse me.
I'm sorry.

04:27.685 --> 04:29.052
I just need to get
into the band room.

04:29.053 --> 04:32.122
I apologize.
We weren't talking about you.

04:32.123 --> 04:33.890
We were talking about--
Girls in high school

04:33.891 --> 04:36.526
who get pregnant
and get married.

04:36.527 --> 04:38.795
Yeah, that's not me.
I'm not getting married.

04:42.267 --> 04:46.503
For the record, I hardly knew
Ricky when we got pregnant,

04:46.504 --> 04:48.772
and I'm just starting
to get to know him now.

04:48.773 --> 04:51.174
So I really wasn't trying
to do anything

04:51.175 --> 04:54.344
when we got pregnant.

04:54.345 --> 04:57.881
I wasn't trying to get him to be my husband
or my boyfriend or anything like that.

04:57.882 --> 04:59.316
You don't have to explain
anything to me.

04:59.317 --> 05:01.118
No, no.
I want to explain it to you.

05:01.119 --> 05:02.619
And you can explain it
to other people,

05:02.620 --> 05:04.087
because I am tired
of explaining it.

05:04.088 --> 05:06.023
You seem upset. Is--

05:06.024 --> 05:07.724
Is it because of
the banner that I put up?

05:07.725 --> 05:09.993
Does it bother you that Ben
and Adrian are now married,

05:09.994 --> 05:11.495
and you and Ricky
are not married?

05:11.496 --> 05:13.664
Why should it?

05:13.665 --> 05:15.465
As Adrian pointed out long ago,

05:15.466 --> 05:17.134
Ricky will probably
never wanna get married.

05:17.135 --> 05:19.336
What about you?
Do you wanna get married?

05:19.337 --> 05:21.405
I mean,
right now in high school?

05:21.406 --> 05:23.907
Doesn't matter what I want.
I think it matters.

05:23.908 --> 05:26.977
I told you,
Ricky doesn't wanna get married.

05:26.978 --> 05:29.980
You never know.

05:29.981 --> 05:31.715
No. You never know.

05:32.917 --> 05:35.085
But, of course,
if he goes away to school,

05:35.086 --> 05:36.753
then the chances
are probably greater

05:36.754 --> 05:38.588
that he and I won't get married.

05:38.589 --> 05:40.991
At least that's how I see it.

05:40.992 --> 05:43.994
Yeah, the interview
went really well.

05:43.995 --> 05:45.429
Thanks a lot.

06:05.149 --> 06:06.750
We're late!

06:06.751 --> 06:09.419
Hey, we're late for our very first
day at school as a married couple.

06:09.420 --> 06:11.755
I know. I'm sorry,
but you looked so tired,

06:11.756 --> 06:13.890
and, well,
I'm tired, and...

06:13.891 --> 06:15.892
I don't think anyone really
expected us to be on time.

06:15.893 --> 06:16.993
I did.

06:16.994 --> 06:18.662
Yeah, me, too.

06:18.663 --> 06:20.597
I'll call the counselors' office
and tell them we'll be there.

06:20.598 --> 06:23.700
I'm sure it'll be fine.
Do you want something to eat?

06:23.701 --> 06:25.202
Uh, what is that?

06:25.203 --> 06:26.703
It's a loco moco.

06:26.704 --> 06:28.638
It's hamburger, fried egg,
and gravy over rice.

06:28.639 --> 06:31.842
No. I think I'm just gonna
go grab a shower, okay?

06:31.843 --> 06:34.478
And get out of here. Okay. Yeah.
Let me just finish up breakfast,

06:34.479 --> 06:36.313
and then I'll go get in the
shower, and I'll get dressed,

06:36.314 --> 06:38.315
and then I'll do my hair and
makeup, and then we can go.

06:38.316 --> 06:40.350
Um, are we carpooling?

06:40.351 --> 06:42.085
We're going to the same school.

06:42.086 --> 06:44.688
Yeah, but I have to go to the
butcher shop after school.

06:44.689 --> 06:46.223
I know.
But you can drop me off.

06:46.224 --> 06:47.891
Okay. But I think

06:47.892 --> 06:50.026
I may be ready to go to school
before you're ready.

06:50.027 --> 06:52.529
I doubt it. You usually take
longer than I do, Husband.

06:52.530 --> 06:54.364
And besides, it's our first day
as a married couple.

06:54.365 --> 06:55.699
I wanna go together.

06:55.700 --> 06:59.169
Whatever you want.
I'll go get started.

07:09.280 --> 07:11.381
What's going on?
Hey, where's Lauren?

07:11.382 --> 07:13.350
I don't know. But I doubt
she took out her phone

07:13.351 --> 07:14.951
during class
and looked at it.

07:14.952 --> 07:18.054
I can do that because of John,
but it's against the rules,

07:18.055 --> 07:21.057
as is hanging out
in the bathroom during class.

07:21.058 --> 07:22.058
What's the emergency?

07:22.083 --> 07:23.792
I wanted to tell you
something face-to-face,

07:23.861 --> 07:26.129
and this is where I wanted to tell you.
In the bathroom?

07:26.130 --> 07:28.598
Yeah. I mean, we have
so many memories in this place.

07:28.599 --> 07:30.100
Oh, no.

07:30.101 --> 07:32.269
No, she hasn't had time
to get pregnant.

07:32.270 --> 07:34.404
But, oh, no.

07:34.405 --> 07:36.473
What "oh, no"?
Did you have sex?

07:36.474 --> 07:38.308
Why is it "oh, no"
if I had sex?

07:38.309 --> 07:40.210
It wouldn't be "oh, no"
if Amy had sex.

07:40.211 --> 07:41.745
Did you?
I don't wanna know.

07:41.746 --> 07:42.979
I did.

07:42.980 --> 07:45.215
Oh, uh...
When?

07:45.216 --> 07:47.451
Last weekend when Ben and
Adrian were getting married.

07:47.452 --> 07:50.454
Oh. Bad timing.
Well, how was it?

07:50.455 --> 07:53.256
It was pretty interesting.

07:53.257 --> 07:56.059
So interesting that you
waited three days to tell us?

07:56.060 --> 07:58.061
Well, I'm not Amy.
I didn't wait, like,

07:58.062 --> 07:59.663
weeks or months or years
to tell you.

07:59.664 --> 08:01.631
It was weeks,
not months or years.

08:01.632 --> 08:02.999
Tell us. How was it?

08:03.000 --> 08:05.469
Uh, pretty interesting.

08:05.470 --> 08:07.137
You said that.

08:07.138 --> 08:09.840
Is that code for "bad"?
It was bad?

08:09.841 --> 08:11.441
No, it wasn't bad.
It was--

08:11.442 --> 08:14.110
Don't say
"pretty interesting" again.

08:14.111 --> 08:15.312
Very emotional?

08:15.313 --> 08:16.580
Emotional?

08:16.581 --> 08:18.648
Like, emotional in a good way

08:18.649 --> 08:20.951
or emotional in a bad way?

08:20.952 --> 08:23.119
During or after?
Yeah, after.

08:23.120 --> 08:26.289
We were just laying there
all warm and cozy,

08:26.290 --> 08:29.192
in the blankets,
snuggled up next to each other.

08:29.193 --> 08:32.662
And I think I saw Jack
shed a tear or two.

08:32.663 --> 08:35.030
Or more. Um, yeah.

08:35.032 --> 08:37.299
He said it was sweat, but I'm
pretty sure those were tears.

08:37.301 --> 08:39.236
Okay. I have to give it to you,

08:39.236 --> 08:41.037
that is pretty interesting.

08:41.038 --> 08:43.607
Mm-hmm.
Jack cried. Jack.

08:43.607 --> 08:45.475
I told you.
Pretty interesting.

08:45.476 --> 08:47.410
Guys are allowed to cry.

08:47.411 --> 08:49.546
I'm sure he was just overwhelmed
with his feelings for you.

08:49.547 --> 08:50.814
I'm not so sure about that.

08:50.815 --> 08:52.215
What else would he
be crying about?

08:52.216 --> 08:53.750
I don't know.
I tried to find out.

08:53.751 --> 08:55.886
I asked him what he was thinking,
and he just kept saying,

08:55.887 --> 08:57.654
"I love you.
" That's a good thing, isn't it?

08:57.655 --> 08:59.856
It didn't seem like he was
telling me because he loves me.

08:59.857 --> 09:01.791
It seemed like
he was telling me

09:01.792 --> 09:03.727
to avoid telling me
something else.

09:03.728 --> 09:05.829
And I kept asking him
what he was thinking,

09:05.830 --> 09:07.831
and he kept saying,
"I love you."

09:07.832 --> 09:09.766
And I would say,
"I love you, too."

09:09.767 --> 09:12.202
And, you know,
then he wouldn't say anything.

09:12.203 --> 09:13.937
So I'd wait a little bit,
and then I'd ask him.

09:13.938 --> 09:15.705
I'd say, "What are you
thinking now?"

09:15.706 --> 09:17.541
And he would just say
he loves me.

09:17.542 --> 09:19.876
And that's all
he ever really said.

09:19.877 --> 09:22.846
Don't look at me.
You've had sex. I haven't.

09:22.847 --> 09:24.748
I've only done it
one more time than you,

09:24.749 --> 09:26.416
and the same number of times
as Madison.

09:26.417 --> 09:29.019
Yeah. I've got a feeling

09:29.020 --> 09:32.055
neither one of you are really gonna
be able to help me with this.

09:34.025 --> 09:36.059
You're late.

09:36.060 --> 09:39.062
Yeah, you know, my dad was here
to marry Adrian and Ben.

09:39.063 --> 09:40.664
He just left this morning.
I'm sorry, Coach.

09:40.665 --> 09:42.098
I'm sorry, too.

09:42.099 --> 09:44.734
You'll be making up the time
with a few laps after practice.

09:44.735 --> 09:46.436
I didn't have
the best weekend.

09:46.437 --> 09:48.538
And now you're off
to a bad week.

09:48.539 --> 09:50.307
I don't like late.

09:50.308 --> 09:52.776
Athletes are supposed to be role
models for the other students.

09:52.777 --> 09:54.578
Role models aren't late.

09:54.579 --> 09:55.946
My dad gave me
some bad advice.

09:55.947 --> 09:57.247
He told you
to be late for school?

09:57.248 --> 09:58.582
He told me
to break up with Madison.

09:58.583 --> 10:00.283
I don't know
that that's bad advice.

10:00.284 --> 10:02.953
It probably wasn't,
but it kind of backfired.

10:02.954 --> 10:05.555
I was gonna break up with her,
but it went another way.

10:05.556 --> 10:08.625
You know that for every minute you
delay going through that door

10:08.626 --> 10:11.962
and I have to listen to this, that's
another lap around the field?

10:11.963 --> 10:14.197
Yeah, I know, but...

10:14.198 --> 10:17.434
I had sex with Madison.
It was a mistake.

10:17.435 --> 10:19.536
You've made
that mistake before.

10:19.537 --> 10:22.272
In fact, you've made that
mistake a few times.

10:22.273 --> 10:24.975
Yeah, but in the past, that mistake
really didn't mean anything.

10:24.976 --> 10:27.377
I mean, this is Madison.
She thinks sex means,

10:27.378 --> 10:29.179
you know, marriage one day.

10:29.180 --> 10:31.948
And I thought I might marry her
one day, but I changed my mind.

10:31.949 --> 10:34.985
Not at the best time.

10:34.986 --> 10:37.487
To explain it in terms
you would understand,

10:37.488 --> 10:39.689
the first half of the game
I was playing offense,

10:39.690 --> 10:42.258
and the second half
I was playing defense.

10:42.259 --> 10:44.060
I should've called
the game off at halftime.

10:44.061 --> 10:46.396
I just-- I didn't wanna
hurt her feelings.

10:46.397 --> 10:48.398
And now I'm stuck with her
for the rest of my life.

10:48.399 --> 10:50.333
You're not married to her,

10:50.334 --> 10:53.236
and you don't have children with her,
so you don't have to stay with her.

10:53.237 --> 10:54.604
What kind of role model
is that?

10:54.605 --> 10:57.607
Just get to class, Pappas.

11:08.419 --> 11:10.787
Hey. I was hoping
I'd run into you.

11:10.788 --> 11:13.590
Here are your keys.
You're welcome.

11:13.591 --> 11:15.492
Oh, I would've thanked you, but
it didn't turn out that well.

11:15.493 --> 11:17.727
I don't wanna know.
I don't know what I was thinking.

11:17.728 --> 11:19.229
No, I know
what I was thinking.

11:19.230 --> 11:20.730
I was thinking about
breaking up with Madison

11:20.731 --> 11:22.499
and never seeing her again.

11:22.500 --> 11:25.201
And that made me wanna see
her again in the worst way.

11:25.202 --> 11:26.369
I don't wanna know.

11:26.370 --> 11:28.872
I knew it was a mistake
halfway into it.

11:28.873 --> 11:30.940
I just felt bad
about the whole thing.

11:30.941 --> 11:33.209
It felt good,
but I felt bad.

11:33.210 --> 11:34.944
Has that ever
happened to you?

11:34.945 --> 11:37.580
Yeah, that's never happened
to me before, either.

11:37.581 --> 11:40.016
Afterwards, she kept saying,
"What are you thinking?"

11:40.017 --> 11:42.085
And I hate that.
I really hate that.

11:42.086 --> 11:44.020
I didn't know
what I was supposed to say,

11:44.021 --> 11:45.689
so I just kept telling her
I love her.

11:45.690 --> 11:47.057
"What are you thinking?"
"I love you."

11:47.058 --> 11:48.825
"I love you, too.
What are you thinking now?"

11:48.826 --> 11:50.827
"I love you." "I love you, too.
What are you thinking now?"

11:50.828 --> 11:52.662
On and on and on and...

11:52.663 --> 11:54.597
How could I tell her that
what I was thinking

11:54.598 --> 11:56.599
was that we really
shouldn't have done it?

11:56.600 --> 11:58.768
Because maybe I'm not
really in love with her.

11:58.769 --> 12:01.471
At least not enough to spend
the rest of my life with her.

12:01.472 --> 12:03.139
At least I don't know that yet.

12:03.140 --> 12:05.141
Don't ever ask to borrow
the apartment again, all right?

12:05.142 --> 12:06.910
Yeah.

12:06.911 --> 12:08.578
Okay, we really

I don't feel like it.
I'm so confused.

12:13.317 --> 12:15.318
I can't pay attention
in class.

12:15.319 --> 12:17.253
I don't wanna have to
break up with Jack

12:17.254 --> 12:20.223
just because sex
isn't what I expected.

12:20.224 --> 12:22.158
I-- I don't know.
He just--

12:22.159 --> 12:25.361
He told me he loves me too many
times, but I feel weird now.

12:25.362 --> 12:27.997
I just-- I don't know if I
wanna be around him anymore.

12:27.998 --> 12:31.334
You can. You can break up
with him if you want.

12:31.335 --> 12:34.270
Don't stay with him
just because you had sex.

12:34.271 --> 12:36.539
You don't have to do that.

12:36.540 --> 12:39.476
You don't even have to stay with
him if you have a baby with him.

12:40.711 --> 12:42.278
Oh.

12:42.279 --> 12:43.847
No offense, Amy.

12:43.848 --> 12:45.782
It just slipped out.

12:45.783 --> 12:48.351
I was talking
about Adrian and Ben.

12:48.352 --> 12:50.954
Yeah. Whatever.
I'm used to it.

12:50.955 --> 12:54.023
Madison, you don't have to
break up with Jack.

12:54.024 --> 12:56.126
Maybe the second time
will be better.

12:56.127 --> 12:59.395
And maybe it won't
for either of you.

12:59.396 --> 13:00.730
I know that, Lauren.

13:00.731 --> 13:02.232
I know that.

13:02.233 --> 13:05.568
But I don't wanna break up with Ricky.
I love him.

13:05.569 --> 13:08.905
And I think that
you might love Jack.

13:08.906 --> 13:10.573
So give him some time.

13:10.574 --> 13:13.143
It's okay to take some time
when making a decision.

13:13.144 --> 13:14.811
Maybe you need
some more time,

13:14.812 --> 13:17.080
but I don't know
if I need more time.

13:17.081 --> 13:18.748
I kind of feel like
part of the problem

13:18.749 --> 13:21.084
is we spent so long
thinking about having sex

13:21.085 --> 13:24.654
that when we finally got around
to it, it was anticlimactic.

13:24.655 --> 13:27.357
And that's what
it was for me,

13:27.358 --> 13:29.893
literally,
if you know what I mean.

13:29.894 --> 13:31.728
Yeah? Well, guess what.

13:31.729 --> 13:34.664
That's not uncommon for girls
having sex for the first time.

13:34.665 --> 13:36.966
You knew this, and you
waited until now to tell me?

13:36.967 --> 13:38.501
Maybe you should
spend more time reading.

13:38.502 --> 13:40.303
What is with you today?
You sound so--

13:40.304 --> 13:42.038
Angry.
Did we do something?

13:42.039 --> 13:45.575
Yeah. You two
have ruined sex for me.

sex if I were married right now.

19:09.640 --> 19:11.774
And I love you,
Mr. Boykewich.

19:25.110 --> 19:27.344
Oh. I gotta put you
on hold.

19:27.345 --> 19:29.446
Someone is parked
in my parking spot.

19:29.447 --> 19:30.948
Really?
Would I make that up?

19:30.949 --> 19:32.316
So what'd you do
with your car?

19:32.317 --> 19:34.118
I parked behind
whoever parked in my spot.

19:34.119 --> 19:36.386
I wanna know who it is.
I will find out.

19:36.387 --> 19:38.422
Hey, do you have any idea
when Mike is coming back,

19:38.423 --> 19:40.891
so you don't have to, you know,
worry about this stuff?

19:40.892 --> 19:43.127
I would assume when Betty's coming back.
And when is that?

19:43.128 --> 19:44.962
I don't know.
I tried calling her last night.

19:44.963 --> 19:47.231
I can't get her on the phone.
She never charges the damn thing.

19:47.232 --> 19:49.066
Uh-huh.
And what does Mike say?

19:49.067 --> 19:51.468
That she's with her family.
Is that all he says?

19:51.469 --> 19:54.271
Just say what you wanna say.
What do you know that I don't?

19:54.272 --> 19:57.274
No, just that he's been driving
her sisters around a lot.

19:57.275 --> 19:59.443
She has two sisters.
I know that.

19:59.444 --> 20:00.644
He says they've been
fighting over him.

20:00.645 --> 20:02.479
And I would care
about that because?

20:02.480 --> 20:04.481
I just wouldn't be surprised
if he doesn't come back.

20:04.482 --> 20:06.416
What?
Yeah. I mean, you know Mike.

20:06.417 --> 20:08.152
He doesn't get out a lot
except with you.

20:08.153 --> 20:09.653
I think he's kind of
enjoying himself.

20:09.654 --> 20:11.255
Well, he better not be
enjoying himself too much.

20:11.256 --> 20:12.523
He better be
looking after Betty.

20:12.524 --> 20:14.324
Well, Mike told me
that Betty's mom

20:14.325 --> 20:16.460
has, um, brightened.

20:16.461 --> 20:19.163
What the hell does that mean?
I don't speak Idahoan. I don't know.

20:19.164 --> 20:20.931
Never mind what it means.

20:20.932 --> 20:23.233
I wanna know when
my wife is coming home.

20:23.234 --> 20:25.836
Nobody's dying.
Her mom's not dying.

20:25.837 --> 20:28.672
She was dying last Friday night, and
Betty couldn't come to the wedding.

20:28.673 --> 20:30.674
But now she's not dying.
I don't know.

20:30.675 --> 20:33.477
I mean, maybe her mom brightened
but is still in jeopardy.

20:35.713 --> 20:38.982
Who we keeping on hold?
Oh. Um, that is no one.

20:38.983 --> 20:40.651
I will take care of him.
Him who?

20:40.652 --> 20:42.886
George.
George--

20:42.887 --> 20:44.588
George Juergens?
Mm-hmm.

20:49.427 --> 20:51.728
George, sorry we kept you
on hold so long.

20:51.729 --> 20:53.230
What's going on?
Everything okay?

20:53.231 --> 20:55.232
I'm sorry.
I have the wrong number.

20:57.168 --> 20:59.102
What the heck was that?

21:00.171 --> 21:02.906
Uh, that was
a personal call.

21:02.907 --> 21:05.475
What? He wasn't calling you.
He was calling me.

21:05.476 --> 21:09.379
Why would he be calling you?
Maybe I finally met someone at a wedding.

21:09.380 --> 21:11.048
I met George when we
were leaving the wedding.

21:11.049 --> 21:12.983
I was outside
waiting for you,

21:12.984 --> 21:14.918
and he was walking his dog,

21:14.919 --> 21:18.088
and he's nice,
and he's cute.

21:18.089 --> 21:19.923
You can't go out with him.

21:19.924 --> 21:22.492
He's-- He's-- He's not someone
you should be out with.

21:22.493 --> 21:24.494
And why is that?
Because--

21:24.495 --> 21:26.163
Because he knows me.

21:26.164 --> 21:28.165
You can't go out
with people who know me.

21:28.166 --> 21:30.067
That-- That's--
That's company policy.

21:30.068 --> 21:33.103
No, it's not.
Well, it is now.

21:34.539 --> 21:36.306
And I wanna speak to my wife.

21:36.307 --> 21:37.808
Try and find my wife,
will you,

21:37.809 --> 21:39.676
instead of making
personal phone calls?

21:39.677 --> 21:41.645
I mean, what is wrong
with people?

21:48.620 --> 21:50.287
Hello?

21:50.288 --> 21:52.756
Hi. Sorry about that.
I should've given you my home number.

21:52.757 --> 21:54.091
Don't you have a cell number?
Give me your cell number.

21:54.092 --> 21:55.425
No, it's too early for that.

21:55.426 --> 21:58.495
Okay, um, maybe I can get it
tonight at dinner.

21:58.496 --> 22:01.131
Wanna go to dinner?
We can swap numbers over a nice big steak?

22:01.132 --> 22:03.066
Well, I don't really know
what time I'll get outta here.

22:03.067 --> 22:05.969
I can wait.
Call me when you're leaving.

22:05.970 --> 22:08.105
Okay. Talk to you later.

22:12.076 --> 22:14.811
Who was that? That was an
age-appropriate straight woman

22:14.812 --> 22:16.813
that I'm very attracted to
and have a date with tonight.

22:16.814 --> 22:19.316
Oh, good. Good for you.
And you don't have to keep it a secret.

22:19.317 --> 22:20.568
You can tell your mother.

22:20.569 --> 22:21.818
No, I don't wanna get in
the middle of anything.

22:21.819 --> 22:23.787
Go ahead. Get in the middle.
No, thanks.

22:23.788 --> 22:25.289
Come on.
No.

22:45.176 --> 22:48.111
I need to talk to someone
about a medical problem.

22:48.112 --> 22:49.980
Like a friend?
We're not friends.

22:49.981 --> 22:52.416
I don't have a friend.
I was thinking someone more like a doctor.

22:52.417 --> 22:54.785
I'm hardly a doctor.
I just went to med camp.

22:54.786 --> 22:56.153
That's the extent
of my medical training.

22:56.154 --> 22:57.821
It's not that complicated
a question.

22:57.822 --> 22:59.022
Camp training may do it.

22:59.023 --> 23:00.891
Maybe if it
were about a friend.

23:00.892 --> 23:03.260
I don't wanna know anything
too personal about you.

23:03.261 --> 23:04.661
I don't mind knowing
about your friends.

23:04.662 --> 23:06.596
Okay. Yeah.
It was a friend.

23:06.597 --> 23:08.498
A friend of mine
was having sex with Madison...

23:10.101 --> 23:11.802
Darn. No, not Madison.

23:11.803 --> 23:13.870
Uh, another friend.
Yeah.

23:13.871 --> 23:16.206
A friend of mine was having
sex with another friend,

23:16.207 --> 23:18.275
and he knew it was wrong,
but he didn't realize it

23:18.276 --> 23:21.111
until the middle of everything,
and then he tried stopping,

23:21.112 --> 23:23.113
but then his body
just took over his brain,

23:23.114 --> 23:24.982
and then it was too late,

23:24.983 --> 23:26.650
and lives are now ruined.

23:26.651 --> 23:28.418
Your question is?

23:28.419 --> 23:30.988
Is there any medical reason
that my friend could use

23:30.989 --> 23:34.024
to explain to Madison--
I mean, the other friend?

23:34.025 --> 23:36.293
Explain what?
Why he couldn't just,

23:36.294 --> 23:38.695
you know, stop
when the game was in motion?

23:38.696 --> 23:40.197
A medical reason?
Yeah.

23:40.198 --> 23:41.798
No, I don't think so.

23:41.799 --> 23:44.334
Maybe you should talk to someone
who went to shrink camp.

23:44.335 --> 23:47.471
Why is that? Physically, I
think you could stop anytime.

23:47.472 --> 23:51.441
If she had said "stop," you
would've stopped, right? Of course.

23:51.442 --> 23:53.443
If she would've told me to stop,
that would've been fine.

23:53.444 --> 23:56.747
If I stopped and--
that would've just been rude,

23:56.748 --> 23:58.248
and it would've
hurt her feelings.

23:58.249 --> 24:00.017
It was her first time.
It could've caused her to be

24:00.018 --> 24:02.486
a psychological mess when it
comes to sex in the future.

24:02.487 --> 24:04.488
Not unlike yourself.
Yeah.

24:04.489 --> 24:07.257
Look, Jack, this is way too personal
for you to be talking to me about.

24:07.258 --> 24:09.860
Talk to Madison.
You need to talk to Madison.

24:09.861 --> 24:12.429
I'm not your friend.
I'm your ex-girlfriend's boyfriend.

24:12.430 --> 24:14.831
This is not healthy
for either of us.

24:14.832 --> 24:16.900
And, frankly,
you're an idiot

24:16.901 --> 24:18.435
to be telling other people
about this stuff.

24:18.436 --> 24:20.937
I can't help it.
I don't know what to do.

24:20.938 --> 24:23.340
I was hoping someone
would just tell me what to do.

24:23.341 --> 24:26.476
Just telling me to talk to Madison--
that's-- that's something.

24:26.477 --> 24:28.211
That's some advice
I can take at least.

24:28.212 --> 24:31.014
Okay, well, do that.

24:31.015 --> 24:32.382
You know,
we could be friends.

24:32.383 --> 24:33.817
I'm not interested
in Grace anymore.

24:33.818 --> 24:36.420
Well, you're not interested
in Madison anymore either,

24:36.421 --> 24:39.322
so you could come back
around to Grace.

24:39.323 --> 24:40.857
You seem to change
your mind a lot.

24:40.858 --> 24:42.859
'Cause I'm confused
about Madison.

24:42.860 --> 24:45.462
I'm gonna go grab a broom
and help you finish up here,

24:45.463 --> 24:48.198
and we can maybe talk some more until I
get clear in my head what I should do?

24:48.199 --> 24:51.501
Maybe you should just go do some thinking
on your own, and I can take care of this.

24:51.502 --> 24:54.704
I insist, all right?
I'll be right back.

25:05.983 --> 25:08.018
Hi.

25:08.019 --> 25:10.720
You let Madison and Jack
have sex in your bed?

25:10.721 --> 25:12.255
I just let him borrow
the apartment

25:12.256 --> 25:13.857
because he wanted some privacy.

25:13.858 --> 25:16.993
I don't know anything
about any of the other stuff.

25:16.994 --> 25:18.107
What? She's your best friend.

25:18.132 --> 25:20.394
I figured you knew her boyfriend
asked to borrow my apartment.

25:20.465 --> 25:22.833
Well, I didn't.
Well, it is my apartment.

25:22.834 --> 25:25.135
Yeah, it is your apartment
and it is your bed.

25:25.136 --> 25:27.804
And if you want me in your apartment
and you want me in your bed,

25:27.805 --> 25:29.339
then you need
to get a new bed.

25:29.340 --> 25:31.708
Because Jack and
Madison were in my bed?

25:31.709 --> 25:33.877
And Adrian.
Oh. Yeah.

25:33.878 --> 25:36.847
Okay. Adrian. Of course.
Everything goes back to Adrian.

25:36.848 --> 25:38.381
I'm not going to have sex
in your bed

25:38.382 --> 25:41.551
that you slept in with Adrian
and other girls.

25:41.552 --> 25:43.553
I'm not. I'm just not.
Fine.

25:43.554 --> 25:45.655
What about the couch?
Are you gonna sit on the couch?

25:45.656 --> 25:47.624
I sat on the couch
with other girls.

25:47.625 --> 25:49.726
Should I get a new couch?
What about the chairs?

25:49.727 --> 25:51.595
Should I get new chairs, too?

25:56.379 --> 25:59.315
I don't know, kid.
Sounds like she really wants you.

25:59.316 --> 26:00.983
She really wants you bad.

26:00.984 --> 26:02.918
No, doesn't sound
like that at all.

26:02.919 --> 26:05.487
She's got excuse
after excuse after excuse.

26:05.488 --> 26:07.523
And I'm tired of it.
I'm tired of her.

26:07.524 --> 26:08.924
She's a big baby.

26:08.925 --> 26:11.060
Who's the big baby?

26:11.061 --> 26:14.096
It's like you're stomping your
feet and insisting you get some.

26:15.532 --> 26:19.101
It makes you less attractive,
as a man.

26:19.102 --> 26:20.336
I'm not doing that.

26:20.337 --> 26:23.305
You kind of are.

26:23.306 --> 26:26.475
I mean, so, I hate
to take sides with Amy,

26:26.476 --> 26:28.410
but she kind of has a point
about that bed.

26:28.411 --> 26:30.512
You've been in that bed
with 100 girls,

26:30.513 --> 26:32.915
plus your best friend,
plus Adrian.

26:32.916 --> 26:35.818
It makes it kind of icky, you know?

26:35.819 --> 26:38.687
You got the dough to buy a new bed.
Just buy a new bed.

26:38.688 --> 26:40.689
What, just so I can
have sex with her

26:40.690 --> 26:43.158
when she has no interest
in having sex with me?

26:43.159 --> 26:46.128
Maybe it's not the bed.

26:46.129 --> 26:48.497
Maybe that's not the reason
she's not sleeping with you.

26:48.498 --> 26:51.333
Maybe she's saying it's the bed,
but it's really something else.

26:51.334 --> 26:53.702
What else would it be?
I don't know.

26:56.072 --> 26:58.807
All I know is
that girl loves you.

26:58.808 --> 27:01.777
She really,
really loves you.

27:01.778 --> 27:03.846
Well, maybe she
just doesn't want

27:03.847 --> 27:05.714
her special night with you

27:05.715 --> 27:08.050
to be in that nasty old bed
up there.

27:08.051 --> 27:10.386
It's not even my bed.
It's the Boykewiches' bed.

27:10.387 --> 27:13.255
People probably died in it.

27:13.256 --> 27:15.958
All the reason
to buy a new bed.

27:15.959 --> 27:17.893
I don't know
what happened to me.

27:17.894 --> 27:20.095
It used to be
that I could just have sex

27:20.096 --> 27:21.597
and not even think about it.

27:21.598 --> 27:23.332
Now it's like conquering
the world.

27:23.333 --> 27:27.002
It takes planning and resources
and strategies and begging.

27:27.003 --> 27:28.971
You know, I'm practically
begging her at this point.

27:28.972 --> 27:30.639
Yeah, stop with that, okay?

27:30.640 --> 27:33.876
Just, like,
take a step back.

27:35.078 --> 27:37.680
Let her come to you.

27:37.681 --> 27:39.982
It's gonna be so much better
if she comes to you.

27:39.983 --> 27:41.650
Yeah.

27:41.651 --> 27:44.520
I think she might've
mentioned something like that.

27:44.521 --> 27:46.355
Is that what happened
with you and Ollie?

27:46.356 --> 27:47.856
You let her come to you?

27:47.857 --> 27:49.858
Um,

27:49.859 --> 27:52.728
that's a no.

27:53.863 --> 27:55.798
Uh, yeah, it was kind of,

27:55.799 --> 27:58.667
uh, the other way around
with us.

27:58.668 --> 28:01.970
Uh, she, um,

28:01.971 --> 28:04.006
let me come to her.

28:04.007 --> 28:05.507
Oh.

28:05.508 --> 28:09.144
I didn't know--
yeah-- how that works

28:09.145 --> 28:12.748
in your relationship with her.

28:12.749 --> 28:16.518
Yeah, that's kind of how...

28:18.655 --> 28:21.123
Maybe it was getting
into college.

28:22.192 --> 28:23.859
Maybe that's it, you know?

28:23.860 --> 28:27.029
That-- That's why Amy's
not doing anything.

28:27.030 --> 28:29.531
Because she can't say she doesn't
want you to go to college.

28:29.532 --> 28:31.533
I mean, she wants you
to go to college,

28:31.534 --> 28:33.769
but you two
haven't done anything yet,

28:33.770 --> 28:36.472
and you're already
leaving her.

28:36.473 --> 28:39.675
I'm not leaving her.
I'm not leaving anyone.

28:39.676 --> 28:41.710
I'm gonna try to get into
some other schools,

28:41.711 --> 28:44.646
and if I don't,
she can come with me.

28:44.647 --> 28:47.182
You, too.
And Ollie?

28:47.183 --> 28:48.851
Whoever wants to come.
I don't care.

28:48.852 --> 28:50.686
I just wanna be with Amy
and John.

28:50.687 --> 28:53.188
That's it. That is it.
That'll do it.

29:01.331 --> 29:03.265
What's for dinner?

29:03.266 --> 29:05.033
Ugh! I'm starving.

29:05.034 --> 29:06.502
I'm not.

29:06.503 --> 29:09.872
Mmm. I smell something good.
That's me.

29:09.873 --> 29:12.174
Well, something's obviously
cooking in the oven,

29:12.175 --> 29:14.176
but you do smell good.

29:14.177 --> 29:17.613
And you look like
we're going out to dinner.

29:17.614 --> 29:20.849
Are we going out to dinner?
I don't wanna go out to dinner, Dad.

29:20.850 --> 29:23.418
I'm tired,
I have a lot of homework,

29:23.419 --> 29:25.454
and I got in a fight
with Ricky today.

29:25.455 --> 29:27.456
Oh, no. Another big fight
with Ricky?

29:27.457 --> 29:30.225
I hope that doesn't delay
moving in again.

29:30.226 --> 29:32.327
I made your mom's lasagna.
It's got about another five minutes.

29:32.328 --> 29:34.630
Now that you're home, you can
take it out of the oven for me.

29:34.631 --> 29:37.499
Or I could use
that extra five minutes

29:37.500 --> 29:39.935
to grab a shower, and you
could take it out of the oven

29:39.936 --> 29:43.405
just like you would've done if I
hadn't just come in the door.

29:43.406 --> 29:45.674
Wait. Are you going out
without us?

29:45.675 --> 29:47.609
I am.
I am going out without you.

29:47.610 --> 29:50.612
I am going out on a date.
With?

29:50.613 --> 29:53.816
No. No, not that woman you trapped
when you were walking the dog.

29:53.817 --> 29:55.717
Not Leo's assistant.
You cannot go out with her.

29:55.718 --> 29:57.786
Yes, I can.
No, you can't.

29:57.787 --> 29:59.405
Dad, if you go out with
her, you're gonna tell

29:59.406 --> 30:01.023
her what I'm doing and
what I'm thinking,

30:01.024 --> 30:03.325
and then she's gonna tell Leo,
and Leo's gonna tell Ben,

30:03.326 --> 30:05.327
and Ben is gonna tell Adrian,
and I will have

30:05.328 --> 30:07.963
no privacy whatsoever,
and neither will Leo.

30:07.964 --> 30:10.432
No one has had any privacy since
the information highway opened.

30:10.433 --> 30:11.767
The what?
The Internet.

30:11.768 --> 30:14.436
Please don't call it
the information highway.

30:14.437 --> 30:16.305
It makes you sound so--
Old?

30:16.306 --> 30:18.574
I may be getting old, but I'm
feeling young tonight. See you.

30:18.575 --> 30:20.075
Good night, John.

30:20.076 --> 30:23.412
Good night.
I hope you have a great time.

30:23.413 --> 30:25.447
No, you don't. Bye.

30:29.686 --> 30:31.353
No, I don't.

30:34.090 --> 30:35.924
Did I just
hear Dad leave?

30:35.925 --> 30:38.460
Yeah. Did you know
that he had a date?

30:38.461 --> 30:40.295
Oh, does he?

30:40.296 --> 30:41.830
Oh. You knew.

30:43.132 --> 30:45.601
Who are you texting
that Dad's out of the house?

30:45.602 --> 30:46.768
Toby?

30:46.769 --> 30:48.003
Mom.

30:48.004 --> 30:49.872
What?

30:50.974 --> 30:53.208
So where did he meet her?

30:53.209 --> 30:56.411
She went with Leo to Ben and
Adrian's wedding last weekend.

30:56.412 --> 30:58.413
George bumped into her
on the sidewalk

30:58.414 --> 31:01.583
and then struck up a conversation
while he was out walking Moose.

31:01.584 --> 31:04.152
Actually, he was walking Moose
up and down the sidewalk,

31:04.153 --> 31:05.787
hoping that she'd come
out of the house.

31:05.788 --> 31:08.357
Wow. Got all the details.

31:08.358 --> 31:12.027
Yep. She's a tall, skinny,
good-looking blonde.

31:12.028 --> 31:15.430
He likes blondes.
His first wife was blonde.

31:15.431 --> 31:17.099
Do you really wanna know
all this?

31:17.100 --> 31:18.700
It's their first date.
It could be their last.

31:18.701 --> 31:21.470
She's never been married before.
What's that mean?

31:21.471 --> 31:23.805
It means there's a pretty good
chance there'll be a second date.

31:23.806 --> 31:25.941
So, what, you thought George
wouldn't be dating?

31:25.942 --> 31:28.744
Are you kidding?
He dated when we were married.

31:30.213 --> 31:32.247
Are-- Are we...dating?

31:33.316 --> 31:35.851
Yeah, I guess we are.

31:35.852 --> 31:38.553
Are we dating just each other,
or are we dating other people?

31:38.554 --> 31:40.789
Am I dating other people?
Is that what you're asking?

31:40.790 --> 31:42.958
That's what I'm asking.
Because?

31:42.959 --> 31:44.960
Because I wasn't ready
for you in high school,

31:44.961 --> 31:46.962
but I'm ready for you now.

31:46.963 --> 31:49.164
And if you're ready to take this
relationship seriously, so am I.

31:49.165 --> 31:52.567
I don't know if I'm ready to take
this relationship seriously.

31:52.568 --> 31:54.636
It's one of the things
I enjoy about being with you

31:54.637 --> 31:55.971
is that you're not serious.

31:55.972 --> 31:58.040
No, I am.
This is me being serious.

32:00.209 --> 32:02.210
Look, I haven't dated anybody
more than once or twice

32:02.211 --> 32:04.513
since I split from my ex.

32:04.514 --> 32:06.515
And I think at this age,

32:06.516 --> 32:08.517
we both know right now

32:08.518 --> 32:11.520
if we could be with each other
for the rest of our lives.

32:14.357 --> 32:16.491
Who knew a trip
to the doctor's office

32:16.492 --> 32:18.493
would turn into
a shopping trip?

32:18.494 --> 32:19.928
Thank you.

32:19.929 --> 32:21.463
Yeah, it was fun.
And, hey,

32:21.464 --> 32:23.799
we needed everything
on that list for the hospital.

32:23.800 --> 32:25.367
We wanna be ready.

32:25.368 --> 32:27.069
Oh, I'm ready.

32:27.070 --> 32:29.571
Yeah, well, you have
at least four more weeks.

32:29.572 --> 32:32.140
I don't know if I
could wait four more weeks.

32:32.141 --> 32:34.509
All of a sudden,
I just feel huge.

32:34.510 --> 32:36.345
Yeah, well,
you're beautiful huge.

32:36.346 --> 32:39.081
Mmm, thank you, Husband.

32:39.082 --> 32:41.083
You're welcome, Wife.

32:41.084 --> 32:43.218
It's weird, isn't it--

32:43.219 --> 32:45.554
being married
and living in a condo

32:45.555 --> 32:47.055
and having a baby
in high school?

32:47.056 --> 32:48.223
Way weird.

32:48.224 --> 32:49.591
It's actually
kind of scary.

32:49.592 --> 32:51.193
Yeah. A little.

32:51.194 --> 32:53.862
But thank you for dinner.
That dinner was unbelievable.

32:53.863 --> 32:55.797
Maybe you'll
sleep better tonight.

32:55.798 --> 32:58.633
You didn't eat much yesterday.
I think that's why you woke up so early.

32:58.634 --> 33:00.635
Yeah. Maybe.

33:00.636 --> 33:02.904
I do feel like I can go to bed
and sleep for a while.

33:02.905 --> 33:04.940
It's 8:00.

33:04.941 --> 33:07.142
Yeah, but all of a sudden,
I'm feeling really tired.

33:07.143 --> 33:08.643
Can we put the stuff
away tomorrow?

33:08.644 --> 33:10.145
Yeah. I'll put it
in the nursery for now.

33:10.146 --> 33:12.547
Okay.
I just wanna lay down.

33:25.884 --> 33:27.618
I don't think you should
be friends with Jack.

33:27.652 --> 33:29.820
You're friends with Madison.
Yeah, well--

33:29.854 --> 33:31.755
And you might as well
be friends with Jack.

33:31.789 --> 33:33.757
He lives here, so--
So?

33:33.791 --> 33:35.993
I don't wanna be friends
with my old boyfriend.

33:36.027 --> 33:38.695
You're not friends
with your old girlfriend.

33:38.730 --> 33:40.264
You're not, right?

33:40.298 --> 33:42.166
Not close friends.

33:42.200 --> 33:44.168
I still hear from her once in a while.
What?

33:44.202 --> 33:46.203
Yeah, I get a text once in a while.
No big deal.

33:46.237 --> 33:48.272
What are you talking about?
I don't know.

33:48.306 --> 33:50.574
Do you talk to her?
What do you mean?

33:50.608 --> 33:53.277
I mean, does she call you?
Do you take her calls?

33:53.311 --> 33:55.579
Do you call her? Does she take your calls?
You know what I mean.

33:55.613 --> 33:58.115
Grace, I was her first.
She was my first.

33:58.149 --> 34:00.150
We have that bond.

34:00.185 --> 34:02.553
We're friends. I wouldn't wanna
not be friends with her.

34:02.587 --> 34:05.322
Well, I would want you to not be
friends with her. She likes you.

34:05.356 --> 34:07.324
Where does she get off
liking me?

34:07.358 --> 34:09.693
She doesn't even know me.
I don't like her.

34:09.726 --> 34:12.529
I didn't think I'd like Jack,
but he's okay.

34:12.563 --> 34:14.565
I just never
talked to him before.

34:14.599 --> 34:16.199
You should meet Angie.
I don't want to.

34:16.234 --> 34:17.333
Okay.

34:17.368 --> 34:19.168
Are you trying to
break up with me? No.

34:19.204 --> 34:22.406
Well, are you trying to get me to
break up with you? No. I love you.

34:22.440 --> 34:24.875
Okay, well, it just seems like
someone's breaking up with someone.

34:24.909 --> 34:30.614
Yeah, but not either of us,
I hope.

34:33.418 --> 34:35.851
Well, this feels
very grown-up.

34:35.887 --> 34:37.888
You know?
And very civil.

34:37.922 --> 34:39.956
Yeah, it does.

34:41.092 --> 34:43.226
So you said you wanted
to talk to me.

34:43.261 --> 34:44.860
Yeah, I wanna talk to you.

34:44.896 --> 34:46.897
I just don't
really know what to say.

34:46.931 --> 34:49.032
Yeah, I don't really know
what to say either.

34:51.703 --> 34:54.170
Are you breaking up with me?
Over sex?

34:56.975 --> 34:58.475
Okay, I'm just gonna
come out and say it.

34:58.509 --> 35:00.244
It really wasn't
what I was expecting.

35:00.278 --> 35:02.613
I didn't feel like, you know,
you were really into it.

35:02.647 --> 35:04.214
You wouldn't
talk to me afterwards.

35:04.249 --> 35:06.116
I don't care how many times
you told me that you love me.

35:06.150 --> 35:08.118
I really didn't feel like you love me.
I'm sorry.

35:08.152 --> 35:10.721
I'm really sorry.
For what?

35:10.755 --> 35:12.623
For having sex with you.

35:12.657 --> 35:14.992
I was gonna break up with you,
but then I changed my mind.

35:15.026 --> 35:18.161
You were gonna break up with me
right after having sex with me?

35:18.196 --> 35:19.730
No. No, no, no.
Before. Before.

35:19.764 --> 35:21.698
I was gonna go out with you, Oh.

35:21.733 --> 35:25.168
and then talk to you and tell you that I
didn't wanna go out with you anymore,

35:25.203 --> 35:28.405
but that only made me think
I wanted you even more,

35:28.439 --> 35:30.340
so I wanted to have sex.

35:30.375 --> 35:33.844
But then, in the middle, I wanted to
stop having sex because it felt wrong.

35:33.878 --> 35:35.779
Not that having sex
is wrong or anything.

35:35.813 --> 35:39.349
I just felt it was wrong
for me at that time.

35:39.384 --> 35:41.118
And I hate saying that.

35:41.152 --> 35:43.954
And I don't wanna hurt your feelings
or anything or make you cry.

35:43.988 --> 35:45.756
Oh, well, I'm not crying.

35:45.790 --> 35:48.759
I'm not crying now, and I
wasn't crying after we did it.

35:48.793 --> 35:50.827
Okay, well,
I shed a tear or two.

35:50.862 --> 35:53.297
Why?
Because I love you.

35:53.331 --> 35:57.034
I really love you, but sex isn't
right for the two of us right now.

35:57.068 --> 35:59.569
No, it's not.

36:01.439 --> 36:02.773
I'm so sorry.

36:02.807 --> 36:04.608
I feel like I ruined
our relationship.

36:04.642 --> 36:07.444
Me, too.

36:10.348 --> 36:12.983
Okay, I-- I don't
wanna do anything.

36:13.017 --> 36:14.584
My-- My parent's are gone.

36:14.619 --> 36:16.820
But they just went to dinner.
They're gonna be back in a minute.

36:16.854 --> 36:18.755
And I-- I don't
wanna do it again.

36:18.790 --> 36:20.757
I wasn't thinking that.

36:20.792 --> 36:24.661
Well, are you thinking
you wanna break up or--

36:24.696 --> 36:26.630
No. I was thinking
I think it's kind of funny

36:26.664 --> 36:29.433
that you don't know that I don't like to
be asked what I'm thinking all the time.

36:29.467 --> 36:31.601
Well, I wouldn't ask you
if you'd tell me.

36:31.636 --> 36:33.670
Okay. I'll tell you
what I'm thinking.

36:33.705 --> 36:35.100
I'm gonna tell you
what I'm thinking,

36:35.101 --> 36:36.139
but I don't know if you're
gonna like it or not.

36:36.140 --> 36:39.843
I don't have to like it. Just tell me what
you're thinking for once. Jeez, Jack.

36:39.877 --> 36:41.712
I think that just because
we had sex once

36:41.746 --> 36:44.981
doesn't mean we have to have
sex ever again.

36:45.016 --> 36:47.851
Maybe not ever.
Maybe in a few years.

36:47.885 --> 36:50.721
But why can't we just see
what dating is like

36:50.755 --> 36:53.190
without having any kind
of sex at all?

36:53.224 --> 36:55.759
You know, we could maybe
make out once in a while, and--

36:55.793 --> 36:59.863
And we wouldn't do anything else?
Anything?

36:59.897 --> 37:02.933
Would that be so bad?

37:02.967 --> 37:05.268
Well, I would still
be your girlfriend.

37:05.303 --> 37:07.771
We just wouldn't have sex.

37:07.805 --> 37:08.872
Yeah.

37:08.906 --> 37:12.309
Okay. I accept.

37:19.484 --> 37:21.718
I love you.

37:21.753 --> 37:24.821
Yeah. You know what?

37:24.856 --> 37:27.224
Maybe you do.

37:27.258 --> 37:29.826
Maybe I love you, too.

37:38.536 --> 37:40.421
Hi. Kathleen.
I'm picking up an order to go.

37:42.340 --> 37:44.808
I'm so sorry.
We're running a few minutes behind.

37:44.842 --> 37:47.811
Have a drink on the house, and I'll bring
your order out as soon as it's ready.

37:47.845 --> 37:50.213
Oh, okay. Oh, I'm driving,
so water's fine.

37:50.248 --> 37:51.882
Thanks.

38:09.634 --> 38:10.801
Hi.

38:10.835 --> 38:12.135
Hi.

38:12.170 --> 38:14.271
Um, you having dinner alone?

38:15.239 --> 38:17.073
Yeah, my date's been delayed.

38:17.108 --> 38:19.443
Indefinitely.

38:19.477 --> 38:21.445
I've been running around
all day,

38:21.479 --> 38:23.647
and I just, uh,
haven't had a chance to eat.

38:23.681 --> 38:27.350
The kids have already eaten, and I
just felt like having something good.

38:29.454 --> 38:31.488
When's your husband
getting back in town?

38:31.522 --> 38:34.491
Oh, he's supposed to be back,
um, next week.

38:34.525 --> 38:36.960
"Supposed to"?
Supposed to.

38:36.994 --> 38:40.330
He, uh-- He really loves
it there in-- in Zimbabwe.

38:40.364 --> 38:41.698
He's not gonna
stay over there, is he?

38:41.732 --> 38:43.867
Well, I don't know.
I mean, he hasn't said

38:43.901 --> 38:46.236
he wants to stay
over there, but...

38:46.270 --> 38:48.572
I don't know, George.

38:48.606 --> 38:52.509
He seems really happy
every time I talk to him.

38:52.543 --> 38:54.878
But th again,
he's just a happy guy.

38:54.912 --> 38:57.180
You know, he has that temperament.
He's always happy.

38:57.215 --> 38:59.716
And you? Are you happy?

39:00.952 --> 39:02.185
Truthfully?

39:02.220 --> 39:05.355
Truthfully, are you happy
you got married again?

39:05.389 --> 39:07.290
No.

39:08.826 --> 39:11.394
Now I want you to be
equally truthful with me.

39:12.597 --> 39:14.898
Are you happy that you
and Anne split up?

39:14.932 --> 39:16.333
Yes.

39:17.435 --> 39:19.269
What do you know?

39:19.303 --> 39:22.606
We finally had the courage to be
completely honest with each other.

39:22.640 --> 39:24.441
Yeah.

39:24.475 --> 39:27.077
But I could've done
without the socks story.

39:33.351 --> 39:34.784
Ah, you scared me!

39:34.819 --> 39:36.520
What are you doing here?

39:36.554 --> 39:38.655
I wanted to talk to you.

39:38.689 --> 39:41.258
I can't talk to you like this.
I look ridiculous.

39:41.292 --> 39:42.692
I just wanna tell you

39:42.727 --> 39:44.528
that if you're thinking
that if I'd leave you

39:44.562 --> 39:46.897
to go to college or something,
you're wrong.

39:46.931 --> 39:48.832
Am I?

39:48.866 --> 39:50.901
Isn't that what
you're doing?

39:50.935 --> 39:53.169
You're applying to colleges
that are far enough away

39:53.204 --> 39:55.171
so that you'd have to live
somewhere else?

39:55.206 --> 39:57.307
Away from us?

39:57.341 --> 40:00.777
Not that I'm not happy
that you're going to college.

40:00.811 --> 40:03.713
I'm happy that you're going to college.
I think that's great.

40:03.748 --> 40:05.882
I'm not going anywhere, Amy.

40:05.917 --> 40:08.885
I don't wanna get married,
but I'm not going anywhere.

40:08.920 --> 40:10.954
I would not go away

40:10.988 --> 40:12.889
unless you came with me.

40:12.924 --> 40:15.058
You and John.
Do you mean that?

40:15.092 --> 40:16.793
Are you asking
if I mean that,

40:16.827 --> 40:19.062
or if I'm just saying that
so you'll have sex with me?

40:19.864 --> 40:21.298
Yeah.

40:21.332 --> 40:24.401
I can't wait to have sex
with you when you're ready.

40:24.435 --> 40:26.736
Hopefully,
someday you'll be ready.

40:29.240 --> 40:32.375
You think maybe Ashley and your dad
can watch John tomorrow night,

40:32.410 --> 40:33.910
and the two of us
can drive up the coast

40:33.945 --> 40:35.946
and have dinner somewhere
on the beach?

40:35.980 --> 40:38.281
Um, it's a school night.

40:38.316 --> 40:40.684
No. Wednesday is
a teacher work day.

40:40.718 --> 40:42.285
We're off from school.

40:42.320 --> 40:45.722
I was thinking
that after dinner,

40:45.756 --> 40:48.124
maybe we could drive
up to the school I got into,

40:48.159 --> 40:51.361
and we could maybe
even spend the night

40:51.395 --> 40:54.497
at a decent hotel
and just sleep together

40:54.532 --> 40:56.600
or stay up all night talking.

40:58.202 --> 41:00.236
Or,

41:00.271 --> 41:01.838
um,

41:01.872 --> 41:05.241
maybe we could--

41:05.276 --> 41:07.644
we could do
what we've been waiting to do.

41:07.678 --> 41:09.613
Maybe.

41:09.647 --> 41:11.881
Or maybe not.
I'll leave it up to you.

41:11.916 --> 41:13.950
Let's just go
to some neutral territory

41:13.985 --> 41:15.619
where we can be
with each other

41:15.653 --> 41:17.654
without feeling like
we're surrounded by the past.

41:25.296 --> 41:28.131
Seriously, I just wanna spend
some time alone with you.

41:28.165 --> 41:29.966
Okay.

41:34.839 --> 41:37.007
By the way,
I'm getting a new bed.

41:53.924 --> 41:56.526
Are you awake?

41:57.928 --> 42:00.063
Yeah, I can't sleep.

42:01.432 --> 42:03.667
Are you hungry?
No.

42:07.371 --> 42:09.272
You're not hungry?

42:09.306 --> 42:10.907
No, not at all.

42:10.941 --> 42:12.709
Is something wrong?

42:12.743 --> 42:15.145
I don't know.

42:16.280 --> 42:18.448
Something just--
just doesn't feel right.

42:18.482 --> 42:20.050
You were just
at the doctor's office

42:20.084 --> 42:21.685
12 hours ago,
and everything was fine.

42:21.719 --> 42:22.786
I know.

42:22.820 --> 42:24.788
Do you want me
to call Dr. Attavi?

42:24.822 --> 42:26.156
He went out of town
for the week.

42:26.190 --> 42:29.259
I can still call his office.
They'll find him.

42:29.293 --> 42:31.695
No. You know what?
I'm sure I'm okay.

42:31.729 --> 42:33.897
You don't--

42:33.931 --> 42:37.167
You don't think
you're going into labor

42:37.201 --> 42:39.436
or anything, do you?

42:39.470 --> 42:42.238
Hey, do you? I don't know.
I'm not sure.

42:42.273 --> 42:44.207
It just...

42:44.241 --> 42:46.443
Something just
doesn't feel right.

42:49.947 --> 42:53.149
You know what?
It's probably nothing.

42:53.184 --> 42:55.218
Go back to sleep.
I'm sure I'm okay.

42:55.252 --> 42:57.454
Are you sure?

42:58.622 --> 43:00.356
No.

43:02.093 --> 43:05.095
You know what?
I'm not sure.
