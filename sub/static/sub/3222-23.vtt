00:22.188 --> 00:23.553
- Who the hell...?
- Leviathan!

00:31.164 --> 00:34.656
- We should be friends, you and I.
- I'd sooner swim through hot garbage...

00:34.834 --> 00:37.359
...than shake hands
with a mutation like you.

00:40.574 --> 00:41.700
Bobby!

01:03.363 --> 01:05.729
- What are you?
- He's a prophet of the Lord.

01:07.601 --> 01:08.966
- That's the word of God?
- Yes.

01:09.135 --> 01:10.602
What's Leviathan?

01:10.804 --> 01:12.328
You can read it?

01:13.573 --> 01:15.905
- Hello, Kevin.
- Only way to kill Leviathan...

01:16.076 --> 01:18.943
...is with a bone washed
in the three bloods of the fallen.

01:19.112 --> 01:21.080
Angel blood.
You gotta bleed an Alpha.

01:21.247 --> 01:23.613
And blood from the ruler
of fallen humanity.

01:23.783 --> 01:24.977
Hello, boys.

01:25.151 --> 01:27.984
- You gonna give us the blood?
- Happily. But not quite yet.

01:28.154 --> 01:29.815
- Well, then when?
- Last.

01:46.806 --> 01:49.240
Good thing we got Crowley
in our corner, right?

01:49.409 --> 01:51.343
Seeing as how it all comes down to him.

01:51.511 --> 01:53.809
What could possibly go wrong?

01:55.348 --> 01:56.747
- Mr. Crowley.
- Hello.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.032
- How do you take it?
- Alcoholic.

02:14.534 --> 02:16.195
Shall we get on with this, then?

02:16.369 --> 02:18.360
Just extending the hand of hospitality.

02:18.538 --> 02:20.267
To a mutation like me?

02:20.440 --> 02:22.032
Tired of swimming in hot garbage,
are we?

02:22.208 --> 02:25.644
Ha, ha, that was a little colorful, huh?

02:27.013 --> 02:28.810
Well...

02:28.982 --> 02:32.145
...didn't mean to offend.

02:32.619 --> 02:33.881
Of course you did.

02:34.654 --> 02:37.088
So if you're suddenly calling...

02:37.257 --> 02:39.987
...I guess you're up to speed
on the Winchesters.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.993
Which means
you intercepted the prophet.

02:43.763 --> 02:47.927
And the prophet told you
that my blood is the key to everything.

02:54.908 --> 02:56.375
You know what I like about you?

02:56.543 --> 02:57.874
Lack of pretension?

02:58.044 --> 03:01.275
- You're smarter than you look.
- Oh, well, now you're just flirting.

03:01.448 --> 03:04.508
Not easy to kill me, but doable.

03:04.684 --> 03:07.016
Especially for you lot. You kill angels.

03:07.754 --> 03:10.314
Certainly wipe a demon off the board.

03:10.490 --> 03:14.017
And yet here we are,
negotiating like proper psychopaths.

03:14.194 --> 03:17.391
Well, I assume you have a vial
of your blood stashed somewhere.

03:17.564 --> 03:21.000
In the event of your death,
it goes directly to Sam and Dean.

03:21.167 --> 03:22.896
See? Smart assumption.

03:23.069 --> 03:25.629
One can't live on looks alone.

03:27.006 --> 03:29.065
- Here's my offer.
- All ears.

03:29.242 --> 03:31.403
Full immunity for you
and your constituency.

03:31.578 --> 03:34.240
I'm talking free-range grazing
for all demonkind.

03:34.447 --> 03:36.847
I'm willing to cordon off, say, Canada.

03:37.350 --> 03:38.977
You can work your little deals...

03:39.152 --> 03:41.620
...have your way with the locals.
All of Canada?

03:41.788 --> 03:43.346
Have it.

03:44.190 --> 03:45.623
Fair. And down here?

03:45.792 --> 03:48.989
Oh, America's ours.
Your sales team stays out. Period.

03:49.162 --> 03:50.629
That's not up for negotiation.

03:50.797 --> 03:53.129
We need America. They're so fat.

03:54.367 --> 03:55.459
And in exchange?

04:00.306 --> 04:04.242
The blood of one sadly
unimpressive demon in New Jersey.

04:04.444 --> 04:06.969
All I ask is that you give it
to Frick and Frack...

04:07.147 --> 04:11.709
...tell them it's yours, stand back,
and let them come to me.

04:14.087 --> 04:18.853
I can't deny I long to see those two
digested once and for all.

04:24.197 --> 04:25.255
You have a deal.

04:26.332 --> 04:28.425
- In writing?
- I don't kiss on the mouth.

04:28.635 --> 04:29.897
Your loss.

04:30.069 --> 04:34.506
But I just so happen
to have a standard rider right here.

04:38.478 --> 04:41.470
I do so like this part. Don't you?

04:55.028 --> 04:58.657
- All right, exit's in 3 miles.
- I still say this is a bad idea.

04:58.832 --> 05:01.460
It was your idea.
It was the best one either of us had.

05:01.634 --> 05:04.603
- I said it as a joke.
- It was a bad joke and a good idea.

05:04.771 --> 05:07.501
Yeah, only because
we got no magic spell, no book...

05:07.674 --> 05:10.370
...nothing on how
to find a freaking righteous bone.

05:10.543 --> 05:13.979
- We can call Castiel again.
- Dude, on my car.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.546
He showed up naked...

05:16.516 --> 05:18.381
...covered in bees.

05:19.919 --> 05:22.217
Yeah, I'm not really sorry
I missed that.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.553
<i>Price of stock hit an all-time high...</i>

05:25.725 --> 05:28.387
<i>...following Roman's acquisition
of SucroCorp. I say Roman's a buy.</i>

05:28.561 --> 05:31.291
<i>Gotta disagree.
I'm gonna call him a wait-and-watch.</i>

05:31.464 --> 05:33.659
<i>- Come on, you're killing me.
- Hear me out.</i>

05:33.833 --> 05:35.698
<i>- This is a new sector for Roman.
- Right.</i>

05:35.869 --> 05:38.269
<i>He's holed up at SucroCorp
headquarters right now.</i>

05:38.438 --> 05:40.269
<i>So sit tight...</i>

05:42.175 --> 05:44.575
Holed up at SucroCorp, huh?

06:08.401 --> 06:10.699
"Should the party of the first part...

06:10.870 --> 06:13.532
...fail to inform the party of the second
of his intent..."

06:13.706 --> 06:14.968
Pause right there.

06:15.141 --> 06:18.542
That should be "party of the second
part vis-a-vis party of the first."

06:18.711 --> 06:21.578
- We just amended clause 314 sub A.
- Sub A.

06:21.748 --> 06:25.343
That's right.
You should do this professionally.

06:25.518 --> 06:26.985
Splendid.

06:27.153 --> 06:31.556
So, "Should the party
of the, uh, second part..."

06:31.724 --> 06:35.922
Well, I guess if we can't find a righteous
bone in a freaking nunnery crypt...

06:36.162 --> 06:37.527
All right. Listen to this.

06:37.697 --> 06:40.723
"Sister Mary Benedict, uh,
taught the learning impaired...

06:40.900 --> 06:42.834
...died at age 23."

06:43.002 --> 06:46.165
Nah, that's a little young.
Find someone who's had time to cook.

06:46.339 --> 06:49.467
Okay, well, there was, uh...
Here, "Sister Mary Eunice.

06:49.642 --> 06:53.544
Uh, fed the poor,
became mother superior at age 60."

06:53.713 --> 06:55.908
Sounds political. Power corrupts.

06:56.082 --> 06:57.481
Ah, right, um...

06:59.752 --> 07:00.844
Listen to this.

07:01.020 --> 07:02.612
"Sister Mary Constant."

07:02.789 --> 07:06.919
Eighty-three years of quiet, humble,
nun-like goodness. What do you think?

07:07.093 --> 07:10.062
Wow, I wanna be more righteous
just reading this.

07:10.229 --> 07:14.029
- Exactly.
- All right. Well, I lay odds on her.

07:14.934 --> 07:16.595
Here we go.

07:20.073 --> 07:24.442
Yeah. Well, let's bone this nun.

07:26.913 --> 07:28.437
Sorry.

07:31.284 --> 07:34.913
"In which case,
the party of the second part...

07:35.088 --> 07:39.616
...forfeits all rights to Canada...

07:39.792 --> 07:41.817
...ad infinitum."

07:42.762 --> 07:44.730
- I think we're done here.
- Susan!

07:46.566 --> 07:48.761
- Yes, sir?
- Take this from Mr. Crowley.

07:48.935 --> 07:51.995
Make triplicates, get pens and a notary.
We're ready to sign.

08:06.786 --> 08:09.186
Is he trying to make a grand entrance
or?

08:09.355 --> 08:10.947
I don't know.

08:11.791 --> 08:13.554
Son of a bitch. He's standing us up.

08:13.726 --> 08:15.591
We summoned him.
Doesn't he have to...?

08:15.762 --> 08:18.595
Crowley wants to screw you,
he'll screw you.

08:19.632 --> 08:23.227
Or he can't come,
because something went wrong.

08:23.403 --> 08:24.427
Maybe.

08:27.573 --> 08:29.564
Maybe it's good news.

08:42.288 --> 08:46.588
- You deal with him. I can't anymore.
- You might wanna be more specific.

08:46.759 --> 08:48.818
I was laying low
halfway across the world...

08:48.995 --> 08:52.487
...when emo boy pops up out of nowhere
and zaps me right back here.

08:52.665 --> 08:54.030
- Why?
- Go ask him.

08:54.233 --> 08:55.928
He was your boyfriend first.

09:10.750 --> 09:12.308
Hey, there.

09:23.162 --> 09:26.290
So, Cass, what's, uh... What's the word?

09:27.300 --> 09:29.666
Well, Dean, I've been thinking.

09:30.369 --> 09:32.837
Monkeys are so clever.

09:33.005 --> 09:37.965
And they're sensible in that they leave
the skins on the bananas that they eat.

09:38.144 --> 09:43.013
Is it really necessary
to test cosmetics on them?

09:43.182 --> 09:46.583
I mean, how important is lipstick
to you, Dean?

09:50.156 --> 09:52.021
Not very.

09:53.326 --> 09:56.693
You wanna come inside
and, uh, tell us what's going on?

09:57.997 --> 10:00.989
Now, you understand
I don't participate in aggressive activity.

10:07.507 --> 10:11.671
Hmm, Sister Mary Constant. Good choice.

10:11.844 --> 10:13.175
Why'd you go to Meg, Cass?

10:13.346 --> 10:15.871
When I left,
I wanted to observe the flowers.

10:16.048 --> 10:19.415
And fruit,
but flowers come first, obviously.

10:19.919 --> 10:22.114
But I heard nothing from them.

10:22.321 --> 10:24.118
You heard nothing from who?

10:24.323 --> 10:25.415
The garrison.

10:27.894 --> 10:31.091
- What happened to the garrison?
- Finally the silence was deafening.

10:31.264 --> 10:33.357
So I went to look.

10:33.533 --> 10:35.728
To the home of the prophet.

10:37.069 --> 10:39.230
You know, Leviathan can kill angels.

10:40.206 --> 10:43.437
It's a reason my father locked them
in purgatory.

10:43.709 --> 10:46.439
They're the piranha
that would eat the whole aquarium.

10:49.749 --> 10:51.148
They're gone.

10:51.350 --> 10:52.942
The entire garrison, dead.

10:54.086 --> 10:56.782
If there's anyone left at all,
they're in hiding.

10:57.390 --> 11:01.918
Uh, I'm sorry.
If the angels are dead, where's Kevin?

11:02.428 --> 11:05.488
I could steal them from their cages,
the monkeys.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.826
- But where would I put them all?
- Hey, focus.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.161
- Is Kevin alive?
- I don't wanna fight.

11:10.970 --> 11:12.733
No, I'm not...

11:14.640 --> 11:15.664
We're worried.

11:17.643 --> 11:20.111
They took him. He's alive.

11:21.747 --> 11:23.772
I felt responsible.
It's in your hands now.

11:23.950 --> 11:25.679
- Hold on a minute.
- I feel better.

11:25.885 --> 11:27.375
Guys, what's all that?

11:29.455 --> 11:31.150
We called Crowley.

11:31.324 --> 11:33.383
- You what?
- Don't worry, he never showed.

11:33.960 --> 11:36.258
- What do you mean, never...?
- He stood us up.

11:36.429 --> 11:39.523
Well, I'm sorry about that, but I'm outie.
He could still show...

11:39.699 --> 11:43.032
Show up at any time. Hello, boys.

11:46.672 --> 11:48.503
Sorry I'm late.

11:48.841 --> 11:50.706
This is an embarrassment of riches.

11:59.285 --> 12:01.776
Stay, won't you?

12:02.121 --> 12:03.782
There's really nowhere to run.

12:05.224 --> 12:07.454
Don't even think of smoking out,
pussycat.

12:07.793 --> 12:10.057
- I got eyes all over the place.
- Leave her be.

12:13.132 --> 12:16.624
Castiel. When last we spoke, you...

12:16.802 --> 12:18.793
...well, enslaved me.

12:18.971 --> 12:21.405
I'm confused. Why aren't you dead?

12:22.375 --> 12:23.569
I don't know.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.075
Would you want to be?
I can help with that.

12:26.245 --> 12:27.837
- Enough.
- It's enough when I say.

12:28.014 --> 12:30.744
I came here to help,
find out you've been lying to me...

12:30.916 --> 12:32.975
...harboring an angel.
Not just any angel.

12:33.152 --> 12:37.486
The one angel I most want
to crush between my teeth.

12:37.823 --> 12:40.587
Oh, so you can crush angels now, huh?

12:41.594 --> 12:44.154
You bore me, you know that?
You've no sense of poetry.

12:46.165 --> 12:49.601
Now, what do you have to say
for yourself?

12:49.769 --> 12:53.967
Well, I'm still, uh, honing
my communication strategy.

12:54.407 --> 12:56.102
I haven't even been back to heaven.

12:56.275 --> 12:58.436
I keep thinking
there are no insects there...

12:58.611 --> 13:00.511
...but here, we have trillions.

13:00.680 --> 13:02.614
They're making honey and silk.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.977
And miracles, really.

13:05.151 --> 13:06.516
What are you talking about?

13:07.086 --> 13:10.453
Um, preferring insects to angels, I guess.

13:10.623 --> 13:11.681
Here.

13:11.857 --> 13:15.623
I can offer a token if you like.
It's honey.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.490
I collected it myself.

13:22.835 --> 13:24.860
You're off your rocker.

13:25.037 --> 13:26.698
He's off his rocker, is that it?

13:30.242 --> 13:31.504
Karma's a bitch, isn't it?

13:31.677 --> 13:34.840
Look, did you come here
to, uh, donkey-punch your old grudges...

13:35.014 --> 13:37.539
...or to help us end Dick? Pick a battle.

13:38.250 --> 13:39.808
Well, I'm vexed.

13:40.353 --> 13:41.820
I'd like to do both...

13:42.154 --> 13:46.022
...but where's the fun
in clobbering a ball of wet fur?

13:47.159 --> 13:50.526
Text me when Sparkles here
retrieves his marbles, I suppose.

13:51.063 --> 13:52.462
Meanwhile...

13:53.866 --> 13:54.958
...a prezzie.

13:55.468 --> 13:57.766
Really? Just boxed up and ready to go?

13:57.970 --> 13:59.232
I'm a model of efficiency.

13:59.605 --> 14:01.732
Is that right? Then why were you late?

14:02.908 --> 14:04.239
Dick had me in a devil trap.

14:05.344 --> 14:08.541
He's not an idiot.
He knows what you two are after.

14:08.714 --> 14:11.114
- So, what did he offer you?
- A fair deal.

14:11.283 --> 14:14.411
In exchange for giving you
the wrong blood.

14:14.754 --> 14:17.552
It's demon, but is it mine?

14:20.559 --> 14:22.390
It's my blood.

14:23.229 --> 14:24.958
- Real deal.
- Why should we trust you?

14:25.131 --> 14:27.258
Good God, don't. Never trust anyone.

14:28.567 --> 14:31.434
Little lesson I learned
from my last business partner.

14:32.004 --> 14:33.062
All right.

14:34.073 --> 14:36.200
- Give us the blood.
- Certainly.

14:36.742 --> 14:38.676
Oh, bonus. Meg?

14:38.844 --> 14:42.245
I'm gonna scoop you up, take you home,
and roast you till you're jerky.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.610
But not yet.

14:45.418 --> 14:47.045
Cass can have you for now.

14:47.319 --> 14:50.777
Hilariously,
it seems he'd be upset at losing you.

14:51.824 --> 14:55.089
And the boys need Cass to get Dick.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.051
Don't they, Cass?

14:57.229 --> 15:00.164
- Oh, I don't fight anymore.
- Come on.

15:00.733 --> 15:04.260
Given the particulars of your enemy,
sadly, you're vital.

15:42.107 --> 15:44.200
Son of a bitch.

15:44.510 --> 15:46.273
Pure iron. Damn it.

15:47.513 --> 15:49.981
All right, my mistake.

15:50.149 --> 15:51.673
- Let's go.
- No.

15:52.852 --> 15:54.183
You stay away from me.

15:54.887 --> 15:56.582
Will you please let me go home?

16:04.864 --> 16:05.922
- I need you.
- No.

16:08.067 --> 16:10.763
PowerPoint presentation's
on your desk for approval, sir.

16:10.936 --> 16:14.064
Great. Susan, do I look like a fool?

16:14.507 --> 16:15.906
Not in that particular body.

16:16.075 --> 16:19.374
Good. Have I told you there
are three rules to contract negotiation?

16:19.545 --> 16:23.572
Bring breath mints, get it in writing,
and have a plan for when they screw you.

16:23.749 --> 16:25.376
Go to the freezer.

16:25.551 --> 16:28.748
- The arm?
- Yup, the arm. Thattagirl.

16:42.968 --> 16:44.663
Sit.

16:46.472 --> 16:48.099
Stay.

16:53.212 --> 16:54.270
I'm Kevin.

16:56.382 --> 16:57.679
Polly.

16:59.485 --> 17:01.783
What are you doing here?

17:02.321 --> 17:05.188
Sitting, I guess.

17:05.891 --> 17:07.722
Are you a prophet?

17:18.270 --> 17:21.797
So, basically, I'm on my own, then.

17:23.342 --> 17:25.708
Well, one thing's for sure.
We only get one shot.

17:26.512 --> 17:28.207
This thing don't reload.

17:29.748 --> 17:31.613
- Think Crowley's, uh...?
- Double-crossing us?

17:31.784 --> 17:33.251
- Yeah.
- You gotta figure...

17:33.419 --> 17:35.114
...who he wants dead more...

17:35.287 --> 17:37.084
...us or Dick.

17:39.124 --> 17:41.251
Depends what Dick offered.

17:41.427 --> 17:43.190
Here we go.

17:47.333 --> 17:49.563
Okay, um...

17:49.735 --> 17:51.669
So do we, uh?

17:51.837 --> 17:54.567
Uh, there's no magic words, nothing.
You just...

17:54.740 --> 17:56.435
Just go.

17:58.210 --> 17:59.939
All right, then.

18:19.665 --> 18:21.963
Where's all the thunder and lightning?

18:23.335 --> 18:25.633
Uh, maybe it worked.

18:26.872 --> 18:27.896
Awesome.

18:32.211 --> 18:34.805
So none of this should cause you
any ill effect.

18:34.980 --> 18:39.474
I went to a little farm in Normandy for
the wheat and the lettuce and tomato.

18:39.652 --> 18:42.018
And I thoroughly examined
and comforted the pig...

18:42.187 --> 18:44.815
...before I slaughtered it for the ham.

18:44.990 --> 18:48.391
Here. You need your strength.

18:49.028 --> 18:50.859
Thanks, Cass.

18:51.764 --> 18:55.222
Hey, Cass, why was Crowley so certain
that you needed to come with us?

18:55.401 --> 18:57.835
Crowley's wrong.
I'll be waiting right here.

18:59.371 --> 19:03.637
But, please, accept this sandwich
as a gesture of solidarity.

19:04.476 --> 19:05.704
Morning, sir.

19:06.645 --> 19:09.045
- The delegates are on their way.
- Perfect.

19:09.648 --> 19:12.139
We'll want everything in place
before they get here.

19:12.317 --> 19:14.877
Send in the security detail, would you?

19:19.892 --> 19:21.655
Hello, Mr. Roman.

19:22.027 --> 19:24.086
Nice watch.

19:37.376 --> 19:38.934
Get dressed.

19:45.684 --> 19:47.117
Why does he want you to...?

20:31.563 --> 20:32.723
I'm a vegan.

20:38.370 --> 20:40.304
- You ready, Polly?
- Mm-hm.

21:02.294 --> 21:05.491
Well, I'm pleased as punch
to see you all here.

21:05.664 --> 21:08.189
Last time we were in one room,
it was inside that angel.

21:09.968 --> 21:13.301
As key players, I need you up to speed
on every aspect of the program.

21:13.472 --> 21:17.841
Not just the sudden influx of happy
delicious stoners in your neighborhood.

21:18.410 --> 21:21.709
Oh, eat up.
The sushi's made of fresh orphan.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.839
Ah, okay.

21:24.616 --> 21:25.947
Alrighty.

21:26.485 --> 21:27.850
The slaughterhouses.

21:28.020 --> 21:31.547
Cutting-edge, humane, efficient.
First one goes online next month.

21:31.723 --> 21:34.419
What's the crowd-control strategy?

21:35.360 --> 21:38.989
Glad you asked. We've laid employees
at key junctures of law enforcement...

21:39.164 --> 21:40.995
...starting with the 911 call.

21:41.166 --> 21:43.726
Everyone feels taken care of.
Everyone stays calm.

21:43.936 --> 21:45.995
We'll up the dose
just before harvest time.

21:46.171 --> 21:47.536
They won't feel a thing.

21:49.074 --> 21:52.840
We're taking a regional approach:
Ohio, beta testing.

21:53.011 --> 21:55.411
Wisconsin, processing.

21:55.581 --> 21:58.379
Florida, breeding program.

21:58.550 --> 22:02.816
Flip to page 10. We're having a ball
buying fertility clinics. Real juicy stuff.

22:11.463 --> 22:13.226
Why are you out of your cage, mouse?

22:13.899 --> 22:17.096
Now I wanna talk to you about
something I'm really excited about.

22:22.574 --> 22:25.543
Everyone, meet Polly.

22:34.786 --> 22:36.378
Got it yet?

22:36.688 --> 22:37.882
Here we go.

22:38.056 --> 22:40.581
Thank you, Charlie, wherever you are.

22:40.759 --> 22:41.919
Gotcha, Dick.

22:42.594 --> 22:45.563
Yeah, that's, uh... That's second floor.

22:45.731 --> 22:47.892
And that... What's that?

22:48.634 --> 22:49.896
What the hell?

22:50.502 --> 22:52.060
Is that Dick?

22:53.705 --> 22:55.297
And that's Dick.

22:56.275 --> 22:57.867
Son of a bitch.

22:58.043 --> 23:02.309
So genetic propensity
for these three cancers, zapped.

23:02.514 --> 23:03.947
She's too stoned to care.

23:04.316 --> 23:05.783
Polly, take off your dress.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.583
She's a slip of a thing, isn't she?

23:11.757 --> 23:13.588
And she eats like a linebacker.

23:13.759 --> 23:16.387
Bottom line, we're not making art.

23:16.561 --> 23:19.052
We wanna engineer the perfect beast.
We want meat.

23:19.231 --> 23:22.530
And these zippy little hummingbirds
have to be bred out fast.

23:24.903 --> 23:27.633
Additive 3.0.

23:28.440 --> 23:34.072
Keep in mind, the stuff we're shipping,
a little diluted, longer-acting.

23:58.971 --> 24:04.034
Additive 3.0 targets only
the characteristics we wanna breed out.

24:05.644 --> 24:08.135
It'll be added to nondairy creamer
and multivitamins.

24:08.313 --> 24:10.508
First shipment heads to Los Angeles
tomorrow.

24:10.682 --> 24:12.343
So watch those dysentery reports.

24:12.517 --> 24:14.576
And stop by the lab before you go.

24:15.020 --> 24:17.488
Because those creamer cups
are just adorable.

24:17.656 --> 24:19.214
Cycle through again.

24:35.674 --> 24:38.507
That's the maid from the motel.

24:38.877 --> 24:40.708
What motel?

24:41.013 --> 24:43.174
Oh, no.

24:44.049 --> 24:46.142
- Oh, Bobby, what are you doing?
- Bobby's...?

24:46.318 --> 24:48.684
- Look, just, uh, wait here.
- Are you out of your mind?

24:48.854 --> 24:51.652
You got the weapon
and eyes on Dick, plural.

24:51.823 --> 24:53.051
I'll take care of Bobby.

24:53.492 --> 24:56.188
- Sam. Hey!
- Shut up.

25:20.786 --> 25:22.981
Bobby? I know you're in there.

25:23.155 --> 25:25.487
Listen to me.
There are cameras everywhere.

25:25.657 --> 25:28.421
There's one right there. Stop, okay?
You're gonna get her killed.

25:33.131 --> 25:35.292
Bobby! Damn it!

25:35.467 --> 25:37.332
How are you gonna kill Dick, huh?
You can't.

25:38.170 --> 25:39.467
Good enough for me.

25:41.106 --> 25:43.233
No. I'm not letting you go.

25:43.408 --> 25:44.739
- Get out of here, Sam.
- No.

25:54.553 --> 25:56.487
Bobby, stop.

25:56.988 --> 25:58.216
Stop.

26:03.328 --> 26:04.852
No!

26:16.341 --> 26:18.241
Okay, thanks.

26:18.410 --> 26:19.536
She's fine.

26:19.711 --> 26:22.373
- Checking out of the hospital tonight.
- Oh, that's positive.

26:22.547 --> 26:25.243
Tell me again why you turned tail
for some maid.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.408
You were right there.

26:27.586 --> 26:30.453
- Shut up, Meg.
- Because Dick made more Dicks.

26:32.858 --> 26:36.453
He must have kept a chunk
of the original Dick Roman somewhere.

26:36.661 --> 26:39.858
- They'd all have to touch it.
- Hey, Shifty, what's your problem?

26:41.533 --> 26:42.591
Do we need a cat?

26:42.767 --> 26:45.201
Doesn't this place feel
one species short?

26:47.239 --> 26:50.367
You got anything to say
on the topic of Dicks?

26:50.542 --> 26:53.875
- Crowley was pretty sure you could help.
- I can't help.

26:54.045 --> 26:55.478
You understand? I can't.

26:55.914 --> 27:00.942
I destroyed everything
and I will destroy everything again.

27:01.286 --> 27:03.220
Can we please just leave it at that?

27:05.423 --> 27:06.856
No. No, we can't.

27:07.025 --> 27:09.255
- Dean.
- We can't leave it.

27:09.728 --> 27:11.423
You let these freaking things in.

27:12.297 --> 27:14.993
So you don't get to make a sandwich.
You don't get a cat.

27:15.200 --> 27:18.260
Nobody cares that you're broken, Cass.
Clean up your mess.

27:22.641 --> 27:23.733
You know...

27:27.445 --> 27:29.003
...we should play Twister.

27:34.920 --> 27:39.289
Nice.
You scared off the Empire's only hope.

27:39.457 --> 27:40.515
Meaning?

27:40.725 --> 27:43.455
It occur to you
every one of those things was in Cass?

27:43.795 --> 27:45.194
He knows them.

27:45.363 --> 27:47.422
He can see past the meat suits.

27:49.301 --> 27:52.759
So he'll be able to spot
the real fake Dick Roman.

27:53.171 --> 27:55.662
Gold star, sugar-pants.

27:55.840 --> 27:59.139
Too bad he's Froot Loops.
You might have had a chance.

28:05.050 --> 28:06.540
No point in looking for a tell.

28:06.751 --> 28:09.311
They all downloaded Dick's brain,
got the same tells.

28:09.487 --> 28:14.015
All right. Then maybe the question is,
what would the real Dick be doing?

28:14.192 --> 28:16.387
Is that the best you can do?

28:16.561 --> 28:18.028
Idiots.

28:18.196 --> 28:20.664
- Bobby, we didn't know if you'd, uh...
- You should have.

28:21.266 --> 28:22.858
You got the flask.

28:23.802 --> 28:24.860
Dumb.

28:25.036 --> 28:27.402
You should have burned it right off.

28:29.274 --> 28:32.505
- Bobby...
- I'm still jonesing to go back...

28:32.677 --> 28:34.872
...grab some poor bastard...

28:35.046 --> 28:37.640
...kamikaze them going after Dick.

28:39.584 --> 28:40.676
It's bad.

28:40.852 --> 28:43.150
<i>America is for go-getters.</i>

28:43.321 --> 28:45.687
<i>Those who get off their butts
and make it happen.</i>

28:50.362 --> 28:51.420
Let's be real.

28:52.797 --> 28:55.322
I damn near killed you
and that woman.

28:55.500 --> 28:58.333
- It wasn't your fault, Bobby, not really.
- Right.

28:58.503 --> 29:01.939
That's just what ghosts turn into.

29:02.374 --> 29:06.071
I really bet the farm
I could outsmart that.

29:07.112 --> 29:08.670
So, what's it feel like?

29:09.314 --> 29:11.305
What? Going vengeful?

29:14.819 --> 29:17.083
It's an itch you can't scratch out.

29:21.192 --> 29:22.819
Look.

29:23.395 --> 29:25.192
I'm done.

29:26.731 --> 29:28.130
Go get Dick.

29:28.767 --> 29:31.463
But don't do it because
you think it'll scratch the itch.

29:32.103 --> 29:34.628
Do it because it's the job.

29:39.577 --> 29:43.570
And when it's your time, go.

30:03.902 --> 30:08.601
Here's to running into you guys
on the other side.

30:10.241 --> 30:15.907
Only not too soon, all right?

31:49.407 --> 31:52.001
- Cass, I need a wingman.
- Dean...

31:52.210 --> 31:56.112
You don't wanna jump
into the jaws of death, that's fine.

31:57.615 --> 31:59.446
How about we run a little errand?

32:10.261 --> 32:13.492
- Thanks for the lift.
- My pleasure.

32:13.765 --> 32:15.494
- Dean...
- Cass.

32:15.667 --> 32:18.261
We've been over it.
I get it. You can't help.

32:19.304 --> 32:23.832
If we attack Dick and fail,
you and Sam die heroically, correct?

32:25.477 --> 32:26.535
I don't know. I guess.

32:26.744 --> 32:29.611
And at best, I die trying
to fix my own stupid mistake...

32:29.781 --> 32:33.273
...or I don't die,
I'm brought back again.

32:33.451 --> 32:36.887
I see now it's a punishment, resurrection.
It's worse every time.

32:38.923 --> 32:40.754
Sorry, uh, we're talking about God crap?

32:40.925 --> 32:42.586
I'm not good luck, Dean.

32:44.162 --> 32:47.825
Know what? Bottom of the ninth and
you're the only guy left on the bench...

32:47.999 --> 32:50.024
...sorry, but I'd rather have you.

32:50.201 --> 32:51.532
Cursed or not.

32:52.170 --> 32:53.831
And anyway, nut up. All right?

32:54.005 --> 32:56.701
We're all cursed.
I seem like good luck to you?

32:59.844 --> 33:01.368
What?

33:02.080 --> 33:04.640
I don't wanna make you uncomfortable...

33:04.816 --> 33:06.784
...but I detect a note of forgiveness.

33:09.053 --> 33:11.681
Yeah, well, we're probably gonna die
tomorrow, so...

33:13.858 --> 33:15.917
Well, I'll go with you.

33:16.928 --> 33:18.327
And I'll do my best.

33:20.331 --> 33:21.821
Thanks.

33:22.333 --> 33:25.564
So can I ask the plan?

33:27.505 --> 33:30.770
Well, according to Crowley,
Dick knows we're coming.

33:30.942 --> 33:34.036
So we're gonna announce ourselves. Big.

35:03.401 --> 35:05.699
Later, ho-nuggets.

35:36.668 --> 35:38.431
The king of hell will see you now.

35:42.607 --> 35:45.872
Kevin. Okay, buddy.
We gotta hustle, okay?

35:46.644 --> 35:49.078
- Wait. We can't leave yet.
- We can. We gotta go.

35:49.247 --> 35:52.045
Dick's got creamer in his lab.
He's gonna kill all the skinny people.

35:52.216 --> 35:53.308
Wait, what? Slow down.

35:54.185 --> 35:57.086
We have to blow up the lab, Sam.
Please.

35:59.023 --> 36:00.081
Yeah, fine, let's go.

36:00.258 --> 36:04.194
You know, I think this might end up
the slickest little genocide in history.

36:04.696 --> 36:08.962
- Thank you, sir.
- Just saying, I smell promotion.

36:20.912 --> 36:23.380
Little abrupt, but okay.

36:24.415 --> 36:25.507
Castiel.

36:25.917 --> 36:27.282
Good to see you again.

36:27.785 --> 36:30.253
Thanks for the ride into paradise.

36:32.890 --> 36:34.255
And good on you.

36:34.425 --> 36:36.859
Pulling that together: A-plus.

36:37.028 --> 36:39.519
Well, you don't think this will work,
do you?

36:40.798 --> 36:43.528
- You trust that demon?
- You sure I'm even me, Dean?

36:44.035 --> 36:45.400
No.

36:45.570 --> 36:47.197
But he is.

36:49.107 --> 36:54.067
The thing when dealing with Crowley:
He will always find a way to bone you.

36:54.545 --> 36:55.807
This meeting's over.

37:14.298 --> 37:16.766
Did you really think
you could trump me?

37:17.101 --> 37:18.898
Honestly?

37:20.271 --> 37:21.795
No.

37:26.878 --> 37:28.470
Figured we'd have to catch you
off guard.

38:04.649 --> 38:07.140
Sam, we should go.

38:07.351 --> 38:08.409
What the hell?

38:08.586 --> 38:10.315
More chompers any second, Sam.

38:10.488 --> 38:12.547
Not to worry.

38:13.858 --> 38:16.292
I have a small army of demons outside.

38:17.528 --> 38:21.294
Cut off the head
and the body will flounder, after all.

38:21.499 --> 38:25.060
Think if you'd had just one king
since before the first sunrise...

38:25.636 --> 38:27.934
...you'd be in a kerfuffle too.

38:28.372 --> 38:30.670
- Which is exactly what you wanted.
- So did you.

38:31.976 --> 38:34.945
Without a master plan,
the Levis are just another monster.

38:35.112 --> 38:38.513
Hard to stomp, sure,
but you love a challenge.

38:38.950 --> 38:41.316
Your job is to keep them from organizing.

38:41.786 --> 38:42.878
Where's Dean?

38:44.388 --> 38:47.289
That bone has a bit of a kick.

38:47.625 --> 38:48.819
God weapons often do.

38:49.160 --> 38:50.718
Should put a warning on the box.

38:50.895 --> 38:53.227
- Where are they, Crowley?
- Can't help you, Sam.

38:57.001 --> 38:59.697
Sorry, Sam, prophet's mine.

39:03.107 --> 39:04.267
You got what you wanted.

39:04.876 --> 39:07.572
Dick's dead, saved the world.

39:07.745 --> 39:09.679
So I want one little prophet.

39:10.314 --> 39:12.748
Sorry, moose, wish I could help.

39:13.484 --> 39:15.850
You certainly got a lot on your plate
right now.

39:16.020 --> 39:20.354
It looks like you are well and truly
on your own.

39:46.651 --> 39:48.243
Wake up.

39:54.892 --> 39:58.350
Good. We need to get out of here.

39:58.963 --> 40:01.158
- Where are we?
- You don't know?

40:03.000 --> 40:04.524
Last I remember, we ganked Dick.

40:04.702 --> 40:06.727
And where would he go in death?

40:09.206 --> 40:12.039
- Wait, are you telling me...?
- Every soul here is a monster.

40:12.843 --> 40:16.210
This is where they come to
prey upon each other for all eternity.

40:17.114 --> 40:18.274
We're in purgatory?

40:19.750 --> 40:20.842
How do we get out?

40:21.018 --> 40:24.181
I'm afraid we're much more likely
to be ripped to shreds.

40:29.026 --> 40:31.017
Cass, I think we better g...

40:32.530 --> 40:34.088
Cass?
