00:09.968 --> 00:12.220
<i>Mom? How are you?</i>

00:12.303 --> 00:14.264
<i>-Let her talk.</i>
<i>-How are you?</i>

00:15.807 --> 00:16.766
<i>Hello?</i>

00:17.851 --> 00:18.852
<i>Mom?</i>

00:20.854 --> 00:21.771
<i>Hello?</i>

00:21.855 --> 00:23.815
<i>Look, get the money for tomorrow</i>

00:23.898 --> 00:25.775
<i>or I'll send her in pieces.</i>

00:25.859 --> 00:26.985
<i>This is not a game.</i>

00:30.613 --> 00:32.032
<i>You have 48 hours.</i>

00:32.115 --> 00:34.075
<i>I'll only give you 48 hours.</i>

00:34.159 --> 00:36.828
<i>Or, I swear,</i>
<i>I'll send her in little pieces.</i>

00:36.911 --> 00:39.289
<i>I already have some money.</i>

00:39.372 --> 00:40.707
<i>Okay, then listen.</i>

00:40.790 --> 00:42.417
<i>Give the phone to my mom.</i>

00:42.500 --> 00:45.837
<i>Don't fuck around.</i>
<i>If you do, your mom is dead, got it?</i>

00:50.216 --> 00:51.968
It was May 26th.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.178
I have three rooms,

00:53.261 --> 00:57.348
and they said
they wanted to rent two of them.

00:57.891 --> 01:00.351
I was showing them the rooms

01:00.435 --> 01:04.689
when they grabbed me by the arms
and said, "This is a kidnapping."

01:05.732 --> 01:07.984
And they dragged me to the car.

01:08.735 --> 01:13.490
Then, they took me to a place
where they put me in a dugout canoe.

01:15.533 --> 01:20.163
We got to a mountain,
and they dragged me as if I was an animal.

01:20.955 --> 01:22.207
Until 8:00 p.m.,

01:22.290 --> 01:25.210
when I was taken to the house
where I'd be kept.

01:26.002 --> 01:29.964
They kept me in captivity there
for eight days.

01:30.924 --> 01:33.384
I was tied up, blindfolded.

01:33.968 --> 01:35.637
I couldn't sleep at all.

01:35.720 --> 01:38.139
Until my family paid the ransom.

01:40.225 --> 01:44.938
One afternoon, they said,
"Get ready, you're leaving, dirty hag."

01:45.021 --> 01:46.564
They treated me horribly.

01:47.565 --> 01:49.526
And I was moved again.

01:49.609 --> 01:53.446
I said, "My family paid the ransom,
why don't you release me?"

01:53.530 --> 01:58.034
I thought they were going to kill me,
because they kept whispering.

01:59.077 --> 02:02.497
They talked on the phone
to a man from here, the Bayo area.

02:03.665 --> 02:05.750
They asked how the area was.

02:05.834 --> 02:07.418
He said it was all clear,

02:07.502 --> 02:11.548
that they could leave me
where they had planned.

02:13.633 --> 02:15.260
And they left me there.

02:17.512 --> 02:19.556
When I took the blindfold off,

02:19.639 --> 02:21.933
I got dizzy and fell over.

02:22.016 --> 02:24.853
The light overwhelmed me,
everything was intense.

02:24.936 --> 02:26.312
It had been eight days.

02:27.480 --> 02:28.857
And there they left me.

02:28.940 --> 02:32.193
Trucks passed by and I signaled for help,

02:32.277 --> 02:33.778
but nobody picked me up.

02:37.866 --> 02:42.245
A NETFLIX DOCUMENTARY SERIES

03:34.714 --> 03:37.467
TRIAL COURT

03:37.550 --> 03:38.927
<i>Your witness, please.</i>

03:39.594 --> 03:40.803
<i>Thank you, Your Honor.</i>

03:41.763 --> 03:45.266
<i>Can you tell me what you do for a living?</i>

03:45.350 --> 03:46.517
<i>I'm a farmer.</i>

03:47.936 --> 03:53.149
<i>Do you know any of the people</i>
<i>accused in this trial?</i>

03:53.233 --> 03:55.109
<i>-Objection.</i>
<i>-On what grounds?</i>

03:55.193 --> 03:57.779
<i>It's an inappropriate question.</i>

03:57.862 --> 04:02.700
<i>The witness is unaware</i>
<i>if those present here are the accused.</i>

04:02.784 --> 04:06.496
One of the most important changes
in the new criminal justice system

04:06.579 --> 04:09.123
is the way of recording the hearings.

04:09.207 --> 04:14.045
Now, there are cameras
on the court ceiling and on the walls,

04:14.128 --> 04:18.007
so the whole process is recorded on video.

04:19.008 --> 04:24.597
<i>And before that,</i>
<i>did you see Mr. Gonzalo often?</i>

04:24.681 --> 04:26.933
<i>Objection, Your Honor. Suggestive.</i>

04:27.016 --> 04:28.601
<i>Okay…</i>

04:31.896 --> 04:32.814
<i>Sir?</i>

04:32.897 --> 04:35.525
<i>Yes, I'll reformulate the question.</i>

04:36.442 --> 04:38.569
I had a lawyer…

04:38.653 --> 04:39.737
ACCUSED INMATE

04:39.821 --> 04:41.447
who…

04:42.282 --> 04:45.618
In the first hearing we had,

04:46.577 --> 04:50.206
he asked a ton of questions,
and they objected to all of them.

04:50.290 --> 04:54.043
He was asked to reformulate things
over and over again.

04:54.127 --> 04:57.714
That lawyer wasn't very capable,
let's say.

04:59.424 --> 05:01.342
<i>What do you do for a living?</i>

05:01.426 --> 05:03.261
<i>Objection. He already answered.</i>

05:03.344 --> 05:06.306
<i>What were you doing on May 26th?</i>

05:06.389 --> 05:07.890
<i>Objection. He already answered.</i>

05:08.558 --> 05:09.767
They objected…

05:09.851 --> 05:10.810
ACCUSED INMATE

05:10.935 --> 05:12.061
…to all his questions.

05:13.271 --> 05:16.691
<i>Do you remember if, on May 26th,</i>

05:16.774 --> 05:22.238
<i>28th, 29th or 30th of the current year,</i>

05:22.322 --> 05:28.161
<i>you had any contact with Mr. Gonzalo?</i>

05:28.244 --> 05:29.078
<i>Objection.</i>

05:29.746 --> 05:30.580
<i>On what grounds?</i>

05:30.663 --> 05:33.624
<i>It's a compound question,</i>
<i>very general, ambiguous,</i>

05:33.708 --> 05:35.335
<i>and can be confusing.</i>

05:36.210 --> 05:40.381
"Plead guilty, you'll get less time.
Go for the short trial," he said.

05:40.465 --> 05:42.675
"We'll get a deal."

05:42.759 --> 05:46.596
The lawyer asked the family
for 1,000 pesos to file an appeal,

05:46.679 --> 05:48.890
and that Héctor would be out in a month.

05:48.973 --> 05:52.185
I called him sometimes
to see how things were going.

05:52.268 --> 05:54.187
Months went by. "What happened?"

05:54.270 --> 05:55.772
And the lawyer was drunk.

05:56.606 --> 05:58.900
I told him, "Go to the gas station

05:58.983 --> 06:01.778
and ask for the security footage
as well as Oxxo's."

06:01.861 --> 06:04.697
"You'll see everything that happened."

06:05.531 --> 06:09.160
And he said, "Forget about the gas station
and Oxxo."

06:09.243 --> 06:11.704
"We are over that. You were released."

06:11.788 --> 06:15.375
"You got a document
saying you had nothing to do with ACP."

06:15.458 --> 06:18.002
Again and again, we face a system

06:18.086 --> 06:22.673
where the accused have no way
of defending themselves.

06:22.757 --> 06:27.345
They can't choose
their court-appointed lawyers.

06:27.929 --> 06:29.263
They don't get paid.

06:29.347 --> 06:32.392
The system isn't designed
for them to win cases.

06:32.475 --> 06:38.231
From what I saw, the defense lawyers
of Héctor, Gonzalo, Juan Luis and Darwin,

06:38.314 --> 06:42.151
couldn't even formulate
the most basic questions in court.

06:42.235 --> 06:45.988
So I decided to find a lawyer
that was properly prepared

06:46.739 --> 06:48.699
to face a trial of this nature.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.285
Andrés Andrade came recommended.

06:51.369 --> 06:53.746
"He's a great lawyer,

06:53.830 --> 06:55.456
highly qualified."

06:55.540 --> 06:59.127
"He has even worked
at the district attorney's office."

06:59.210 --> 07:02.547
So I thought,
"Okay, this is the perfect lawyer."

07:02.630 --> 07:06.801
"Amazing, because he understands
how this institution operates

07:06.884 --> 07:08.428
so he'll be able to expose it."

07:09.011 --> 07:11.806
MAY, 2015
GLP IS KIDNAPPED

07:11.889 --> 07:15.184
JUNE - HÉCTOR, GONZALO,
JUAN LUIS AND DARWIN ARE ARRESTED

07:15.268 --> 07:17.687
FIRST HEARINGS FOR THE GLP CASE

07:18.563 --> 07:23.234
FEBRUARY, 2016
ROBERTO MEETS GONZALO

07:23.317 --> 07:26.988
APRIL, 2017
ANDRÉS TAKES THE CASE

07:28.114 --> 07:32.034
651 DAYS IN PRISON
APRIL 3RD, 2017

07:33.870 --> 07:37.165
I started working
in the Tabasco State prosecutor's office,

07:37.248 --> 07:39.792
thanks to the State General Attorney,
Fernando Valenzuela.

07:41.294 --> 07:45.840
He invited me to work there,
and I was appointed to Major Crimes.

07:47.884 --> 07:51.429
After witnessing some situations
I wasn't comfortable with,

07:51.512 --> 07:54.891
I decided to quit and start my own office.

07:56.017 --> 07:59.061
It was at this time,
while working in my new office

07:59.145 --> 08:03.816
as a lawyer specialized in criminal law
under the new justice system,

08:03.900 --> 08:06.694
that I got a call from Roberto Hernández,

08:06.777 --> 08:10.823
and he asked me
to take the case of these guys.

08:10.907 --> 08:12.492
There was a turning point

08:12.575 --> 08:16.579
where the accused
and their families were informed

08:16.662 --> 08:22.877
that I would take on the case
as defense lawyer moving forward.

08:22.960 --> 08:27.965
Alberto and I immediately clicked,
we got along really well.

08:29.467 --> 08:32.553
I was unjustly sentenced myself.

08:32.637 --> 08:34.222
I spent six years in jail.

08:34.805 --> 08:38.100
Because of this terrible experience,

08:38.184 --> 08:43.231
I decided to become a trial lawyer.

08:44.565 --> 08:46.776
Andrés came to see us.

08:48.027 --> 08:50.988
He explained things to us.

08:51.072 --> 08:54.825
We could immediately see
how good he was, how capable.

08:56.994 --> 08:59.956
You can tell the difference
by his way of speaking.

09:00.039 --> 09:01.624
He doesn't hesitate.

09:05.294 --> 09:07.838
We were approached by many inmates

09:07.922 --> 09:12.093
that were in the same prison,
in Macuspana, with them.

09:12.176 --> 09:14.178
They asked us to review their cases.

09:14.262 --> 09:17.932
Surprisingly, most of them
were accused of kidnapping,

09:18.015 --> 09:20.726
which, statistically,
is almost impossible.

09:21.310 --> 09:24.814
When we met this lawyer
and saw how he expressed himself…

09:25.731 --> 09:27.358
We could see the difference.

09:27.441 --> 09:31.529
"This lawyer is completely different
from the previous one."

09:32.154 --> 09:34.490
He told us not to worry.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.118
Not once did he tell us to plead guilty.

09:37.952 --> 09:39.829
He started managing our case well.

09:42.582 --> 09:47.753
The thing is, they are being held
for attempted kidnapping.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.046
However,

09:49.130 --> 09:51.048
Darwin was arrested

09:51.132 --> 09:55.052
in a totally different place
and for other reasons.

09:55.136 --> 09:58.681
Héctor, Juan Luis and Gonzalo
were arrested at the gas station

09:58.764 --> 10:03.894
for being involved, presumably,
in the kidnapping attempt of ACP.

10:03.978 --> 10:05.688
The truth is, they are detained

10:07.231 --> 10:09.775
only to get the opportunity

10:09.859 --> 10:12.903
to do a police lineup

10:13.571 --> 10:16.949
for the kidnapping of GLP,
who is ACP's sister.

10:24.957 --> 10:30.087
FIRST TRIAL HEARING
JUNE 6TH, 2017

10:45.061 --> 10:47.813
-Hi!
-Hi, Eva, thanks for coming.

10:47.897 --> 10:50.399
-Thank you, sir.
-Hi, how are you?

10:51.067 --> 10:51.984
Good morning.

10:52.068 --> 10:55.488
My name is Roberto.
I'm not part of the defense.

10:57.198 --> 11:00.034
I'm interested
in the truth of what happened.

11:00.117 --> 11:03.287
And my work here
is to capture it on camera,

11:03.371 --> 11:06.582
to record what is going on
and reveal the truth.

11:07.458 --> 11:08.292
Good morning.

11:08.376 --> 11:09.710
-Hi, Andrés.
-How are you?

11:09.794 --> 11:11.170
-Good.
-Glad to see you.

11:11.253 --> 11:13.589
I'm explaining to them who you are.

11:13.673 --> 11:14.507
Sure.

11:15.049 --> 11:17.051
-This is Andrés.
-Right.

11:17.134 --> 11:19.720
Hello everyone, nice to meet you.

11:19.804 --> 11:23.307
Andrés Andrade, at your service.
We haven't met before.

11:23.391 --> 11:26.477
I want to briefly let you know

11:26.560 --> 11:29.438
that we are studying the case
in great detail.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.816
There are many elements

11:32.441 --> 11:34.819
that give us a chance of success,

11:34.902 --> 11:37.988
and present the best case we can.

11:38.489 --> 11:43.119
How much will you charge
for representing these four guys?

11:43.202 --> 11:45.496
Nothing whatsoever. Zero pesos.

11:45.579 --> 11:47.748
Nothing, no fees, not even expenses.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.333
Thank you, God bless you.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.627
No problem. It's my pleasure.

11:59.135 --> 12:01.262
<i>Juan Luis López García,</i>

12:01.345 --> 12:03.431
<i>Gonzalo García Hernández</i>

12:03.514 --> 12:05.891
<i>and Darwin Morales Ortiz,</i>

12:07.435 --> 12:12.690
<i>violently forced the victim</i>
<i>into a green Jetta vehicle,</i>

12:12.773 --> 12:16.694
<i>threatening to murder her and her family.</i>

12:17.194 --> 12:20.489
<i>Héctor Muñoz Muñoz</i> <i>was in charge</i>

12:20.573 --> 12:25.911
<i>of taking care of the victim</i>
<i>and guarding her.</i>

12:26.746 --> 12:30.541
<i>Their active participation will be proved</i>

12:30.624 --> 12:33.294
<i>beyond a reasonable doubt.</i>

12:33.377 --> 12:38.257
The prosecution, representing
the state of Tabasco, started worrying

12:38.340 --> 12:40.718
when Andrés Andrade took the case.

12:40.801 --> 12:45.222
So they decided that the Major Crimes
deputy district attorney,

12:45.306 --> 12:47.808
Francisco Vera Ayala, would take the case

12:47.892 --> 12:50.895
along with the district attorney,
Mrs. Delfín Rosales.

12:55.733 --> 12:59.904
Mrs. Delfín is the best lawyer
they have in Major Crimes.

13:00.404 --> 13:02.782
Period. She's the best.

13:02.865 --> 13:04.909
She deals with delicate matters.

13:05.534 --> 13:07.369
-Like this one.
-Right.

13:07.453 --> 13:10.748
María del Rosario Delfín
is the district attorney.

13:11.749 --> 13:16.504
Since the very beginning,
we were warned about her.

13:17.129 --> 13:23.010
<i>The fact that the victim was kidnapped</i>
<i>on May 26th, 2015, is not disputed.</i>

13:23.093 --> 13:24.970
<i>We are categorically disputing</i>

13:25.054 --> 13:29.350
<i>the participation of Héctor,</i>
<i>Darwin, Gonzalo and Juan Luis.</i>

13:30.059 --> 13:31.727
<i>It will be proved</i>

13:31.811 --> 13:35.439
<i>that there has been a complete lack</i>
<i>of criminal investigation</i>

13:35.523 --> 13:39.193
<i>regarding the kidnapping</i>
<i>of the victim of undisclosed identity.</i>

13:39.276 --> 13:42.655
<i>The prosecution</i>
<i>has tried to compensate for this</i> <i>failure</i>

13:42.738 --> 13:45.574
<i>by forcing and inducing the victim</i>

13:45.658 --> 13:48.285
<i>to incorrectly and illegally identify</i>

13:48.369 --> 13:49.495
<i>these four men.</i>

13:50.079 --> 13:51.497
What happened?

13:51.580 --> 13:53.207
ACP, at some point,

13:53.290 --> 13:56.168
when he accuses them
of trying to kidnap him,

13:57.294 --> 14:01.715
realizes, and is probably told
by the district attorneys,

14:01.799 --> 14:04.760
that the case was untenable,

14:04.844 --> 14:07.805
because they have nothing,
no evidence whatsoever.

14:08.597 --> 14:12.309
So they decide to link them
to his sister's kidnapping.

14:13.060 --> 14:18.482
He and the district attorneys
put pressure on Mrs. GLP, his sister,

14:19.149 --> 14:23.320
who identifies the suspects
in a biased, rigged police lineup,

14:23.404 --> 14:25.322
with the sole objective

14:26.073 --> 14:29.827
of holding them responsible
for her kidnapping.

14:30.411 --> 14:32.288
<i>If, by the end of this trial,</i>

14:32.371 --> 14:35.082
<i>the court sees</i>
<i>that there could be a possibility</i>

14:35.165 --> 14:38.419
<i>that these men didn't take part</i>
<i>in the kidnapping,</i>

14:38.502 --> 14:40.838
<i>it is your duty to acquit them.</i>

14:40.921 --> 14:42.256
<i>That's all, Your Honor.</i>

14:42.339 --> 14:46.760
The court needs to take into account
the information you have.

14:46.844 --> 14:50.222
Where Darwin was, where Juan Luis was,

14:50.306 --> 14:51.807
where Héctor was,

14:52.349 --> 14:53.809
and where Gonzalo was.

14:55.352 --> 14:58.063
They depend on you
to put the story together.

14:58.147 --> 15:00.190
You need to be prepared,

15:00.274 --> 15:02.443
not to make things up,

15:02.526 --> 15:04.445
but to explain the truth.

15:19.126 --> 15:20.878
WITNESSES MEETING

15:20.961 --> 15:23.172
I went to the office of Major Crimes.

15:23.255 --> 15:27.301
I ran into César Oliveros,
their deputy district attorney.

15:28.052 --> 15:31.597
He came straight for me.
I've known him for a long time.

15:31.680 --> 15:33.098
He wasn't happy.

15:33.182 --> 15:37.186
He said, "What the fuck,
are you defending kidnappers now?"

15:37.269 --> 15:38.187
I was shocked.

15:38.270 --> 15:40.314
I said, "Hi, César, how are you?"

15:40.397 --> 15:44.443
"I'm dealing with different cases,
but if you are talking about…"

15:44.526 --> 15:48.238
"Yes, those guys from Macuspana.
They're guilty."

15:48.322 --> 15:49.949
I said, "You're wrong."

15:50.032 --> 15:52.242
"Forget it, they're playing dumb."

15:52.326 --> 15:55.913
"They're guilty, period.
It's a done deal."

15:55.996 --> 15:59.833
So I told him I was actually
looking for him to talk about it.

15:59.917 --> 16:03.003
"No, if it's about that, forget it."

16:03.087 --> 16:05.089
"They are guilty. Period."

16:06.215 --> 16:08.467
And how do you feel?

16:08.550 --> 16:10.135
Good, I'm calm.

16:10.219 --> 16:11.220
Not mad?

16:13.222 --> 16:14.139
A little.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.183
A little, but I'm fine.

16:16.266 --> 16:17.768
Cool.

16:17.851 --> 16:20.938
-Okay. Shall we start then?
-Sure.

16:21.021 --> 16:23.816
Hi there. How are you? Come on in.

16:26.777 --> 16:30.197
Do not answer
until they finish asking the question.

16:30.280 --> 16:34.326
It's normal,
we tend to assume what they are asking,

16:34.410 --> 16:35.619
and answer quickly.

16:35.703 --> 16:39.123
But we might want to object
because the question is complex

16:39.206 --> 16:42.418
and could be detrimental for the case.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.962
But if you answer, there's no going back.

16:45.045 --> 16:47.214
The objection won't be valid.

16:47.923 --> 16:50.175
-Right?
-She's Juan Luis's mother.

16:50.259 --> 16:53.345
Okay, what will your testimony be about?

16:53.429 --> 16:54.972
What will you testify?

16:55.055 --> 16:58.058
That on the 25th, he came home

16:58.142 --> 17:01.937
because they were going
to celebrate his son's birthday.

17:02.521 --> 17:05.274
We went to see my mom,

17:05.357 --> 17:07.943
because for every birthday,

17:08.861 --> 17:10.404
my mom prepared the food.

17:10.487 --> 17:12.990
She gave me a hand with the food.

17:14.033 --> 17:16.910
<i>We came back from shopping</i>

17:17.619 --> 17:18.787
<i>and it was late…</i>

17:18.871 --> 17:19.913
DEFENSE WITNESS

17:19.997 --> 17:22.791
<i>…so I told my son to stay home.</i>

17:22.875 --> 17:26.920
<i>And he said, "No, we need to go,</i>
<i>we're leaving early in the morning."</i>

17:28.130 --> 17:32.176
<i>My partner, Juan Luis,</i>

17:32.259 --> 17:33.677
<i>was unjustly accused.</i>

17:33.761 --> 17:37.514
<i>I know for a fact, that on the day</i>
<i>of the events he's accused of,</i>

17:37.598 --> 17:38.974
<i>he was with me.</i>

17:39.767 --> 17:42.019
<i>What day do you mean?</i>

17:42.102 --> 17:43.854
<i>May 26th.</i>

17:45.439 --> 17:48.609
<i>But, just to be clear,</i>
<i>we were together from the 25th.</i>

17:49.860 --> 17:51.028
<i>No further questions.</i>

17:51.111 --> 17:53.113
On that day, May 26th,

17:53.655 --> 17:56.658
I was five hours away from here.

17:56.742 --> 17:59.870
I was working
with Mrs. Hermelinda. With her son.

18:00.704 --> 18:01.830
On her land.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.290
I was fumigating.

18:03.373 --> 18:04.750
DEFENSE WITNESS

18:04.833 --> 18:09.421
<i>That day, I went to see him</i>
<i>to ask him to help us fumigate.</i>

18:10.089 --> 18:13.217
<i>-What time did you go see him?</i>
<i>-Six in the morning.</i>

18:13.300 --> 18:15.344
Where were you on May 26th, 2015?

18:15.427 --> 18:16.678
I was at work.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.430
I was working at Techint.

18:18.514 --> 18:21.225
When we get to work at 7:00 a.m.,

18:21.308 --> 18:24.103
we have to sign this sheet.

18:24.186 --> 18:25.729
-Let me see.
-At 7:00.

18:25.813 --> 18:27.564
-The company is Techint?
-Yes.

18:28.190 --> 18:30.692
-You're a backhoe operator.
-Exactly.

18:31.276 --> 18:34.613
You got there at 7:00 a.m.
and left at 4:00 p.m.

18:34.696 --> 18:37.991
-When did the kidnapping take place?
-At 7:00 a.m.

18:39.493 --> 18:43.247
I was working with Mrs. Yazmín
in the butcher's shop.

18:43.872 --> 18:45.415
I was killing pigs,

18:45.499 --> 18:50.546
and my bosses can confirm
that I go to work every single day.

18:51.088 --> 18:53.132
I've never let that lady down.

18:53.215 --> 18:57.594
<i>If I wasn't sure that he was there</i>
<i>that day, I wouldn't come here.</i>

18:57.678 --> 19:02.057
<i>On that day,</i>
<i>he was working at my shop with me.</i>

19:02.599 --> 19:07.396
<i>Okay. Do you remember what he was wearing?</i>

19:07.479 --> 19:10.816
<i>Objection, Your Honor.</i>
<i>That is completely irrelevant.</i>

19:12.276 --> 19:17.364
<i>Do you think his way of presenting himself</i>
<i>at work is irrelevant?</i>

19:17.447 --> 19:18.448
<i>Objection.</i>

19:18.532 --> 19:21.285
<i>-It's irrelevant.</i>
<i>-And inappropriate.</i>

19:22.035 --> 19:23.287
<i>Objection sustained.</i>

19:23.787 --> 19:28.542
<i>Do you remember seeing Mr. Darwin</i>

19:29.084 --> 19:31.837
<i>talking at some point to…</i>

19:33.380 --> 19:35.841
<i>the man who works in the stall in front?</i>

19:35.924 --> 19:36.758
<i>Objection.</i>

19:37.509 --> 19:41.263
<i>This question has nothing to do</i>
<i>with the interrogation</i>

19:41.346 --> 19:42.556
<i>and it's irrelevant.</i>

19:42.639 --> 19:43.849
<i>Objection sustained.</i>

20:02.242 --> 20:05.120
Look, that van is from Major Crimes.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.915
-The van at the back…
-It has no license plate.

20:07.998 --> 20:09.917
That van is from Major Crimes.

20:17.341 --> 20:19.218
Okay, continue.

20:19.301 --> 20:22.387
Last year, in September… what day again?

20:22.471 --> 20:23.513
September 13th.

20:23.597 --> 20:26.308
-That day they went to your house.
-Yes.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.185
You recognized…

20:28.810 --> 20:31.855
Of the 30 people you say
were in your house,

20:32.397 --> 20:35.359
here, today, did you recognize any?

20:35.442 --> 20:37.069
-Two of them.
-Two.

20:37.152 --> 20:40.489
And what car did they leave in today?

20:40.572 --> 20:44.493
In the same white van
they came to my house with.

20:44.576 --> 20:47.454
Okay. I took pictures of a white van.

20:47.537 --> 20:49.581
-Is this the white van?
-That's it.

20:49.665 --> 20:51.541
-That's the van.
-Okay.

20:56.672 --> 20:58.632
It was around 9:00 p.m.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.511
Loud knocks on the door.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.472
I see a hooded man.

21:05.555 --> 21:08.141
They point at me
with flashlights and guns.

21:08.225 --> 21:11.728
I look through the front window
and see 15 people

21:11.812 --> 21:13.647
coming to knock on my door.

21:14.606 --> 21:16.233
Jesus, what's happening?

21:16.316 --> 21:18.568
They finally manage to open the door

21:18.652 --> 21:21.571
and a man grabs me by the hair
and takes me to the room.

21:22.864 --> 21:25.617
He says, "Where are the drugs and guns?"

21:25.701 --> 21:28.203
"What guns? What drugs? What do you mean?"

21:28.287 --> 21:32.499
They go through everything,
mess up my clothes, flip the bed…

21:32.582 --> 21:34.793
I keep telling my kids to get up.

21:34.876 --> 21:36.128
"What's going on?"

21:37.337 --> 21:38.463
Then a man…

21:39.256 --> 21:42.676
Some men had their faces uncovered,

21:43.468 --> 21:46.847
and they were wearing the uniform
of the district attorney's office.

21:46.930 --> 21:49.516
They had their identification.

21:50.517 --> 21:53.186
A man says to me, "Don't worry."

21:53.687 --> 21:56.440
But the other man grabs me and hits me.

21:56.523 --> 21:58.275
He hit me with his gun.

21:58.358 --> 21:59.985
He asks my name.

22:00.068 --> 22:01.778
"Who are you people?" I say.

22:01.862 --> 22:05.365
"You don't ask the questions, you idiot.
I do," he says.

22:07.075 --> 22:09.036
Why are they doing this to us?

22:09.119 --> 22:11.413
So I think, "This must be
to do with Darwin."

22:12.122 --> 22:15.000
I ask them,
"Is it because I'm testifying for Darwin?"

22:15.083 --> 22:16.251
They had my ID.

22:16.835 --> 22:18.795
"That's why they are doing this."

22:25.927 --> 22:31.141
All the crimes that, by nature,
are considered major in our society

22:31.767 --> 22:35.270
are dealt with by Major Crimes.

22:35.354 --> 22:39.733
They take care of kidnappings,
homicides, rapes.

22:39.816 --> 22:42.027
That kind of crime,

22:42.110 --> 22:45.113
where there is money
and a lot of violence involved.

22:45.822 --> 22:49.242
If you look through
the newspapers of the time,

22:49.326 --> 22:51.244
there are many reports

22:51.328 --> 22:54.956
of blackmail, kidnappings, torture.

22:55.040 --> 22:58.251
If there's no consequence,
no prosecution,

22:58.335 --> 23:00.253
you're creating a monster.

23:01.088 --> 23:04.091
The fact that someone
who knows their inner workings,

23:04.174 --> 23:08.929
and who left because he didn't agree
with their methods

23:09.012 --> 23:12.307
and brings cameras with him,
made many people nervous.

23:20.524 --> 23:23.151
…but the illness came for a reason.

23:23.693 --> 23:26.113
Today we thank you, Lord,

23:26.196 --> 23:30.992
for giving us once again the chance
to worship you and hear your advice.

23:31.076 --> 23:32.577
Holy Spirit of God,

23:32.661 --> 23:36.581
according to your word,
if two of you shall agree on earth,

23:36.665 --> 23:39.459
anything they ask
for shall be done for them.

23:39.543 --> 23:42.712
Father, we now ask,
with full faith in You…

23:47.300 --> 23:49.511
You know his first and last name, Father.

23:49.594 --> 23:53.265
Dear God,
this illness that causes him pain…

23:53.348 --> 23:56.643
The Bible says in Isaiah, chapter 53…

23:58.895 --> 24:00.772
…cut out his tongue for snitching!

24:03.108 --> 24:05.026
I know it's not easy being here.

24:05.110 --> 24:07.946
And, as I told you,
it's not easy out there either.

24:08.029 --> 24:09.281
You know that.

24:10.157 --> 24:13.326
You know I'm fighting
for the kids and for you.

24:13.910 --> 24:15.036
I've told you that.

24:16.288 --> 24:18.290
So pray a lot,

24:18.373 --> 24:20.792
and don't be pessimistic, okay?

24:20.876 --> 24:21.751
Yes.

24:21.835 --> 24:23.712
-Take care.
-You too.

24:23.795 --> 24:26.298
Okay. Bye.

24:26.381 --> 24:27.382
Take care.

24:28.967 --> 24:32.679
Providing for your family
is tough from here.

24:32.762 --> 24:35.557
That… hurts a lot.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.893
You have no way of helping them.

24:37.976 --> 24:42.272
I've met many people here
who lost their wives, their families.

24:42.355 --> 24:44.191
There's nothing you can do.

24:44.733 --> 24:46.735
Out there is different.

24:47.819 --> 24:49.112
Being here…

24:50.780 --> 24:52.199
away from my family…

24:53.950 --> 24:55.410
from my son…

24:56.077 --> 25:01.917
I was actually separated from him
when he was around four years old.

25:02.709 --> 25:07.172
His boy, like all kids,
asks for toys and things like that.

25:07.255 --> 25:09.925
Every time Gonzalo managed to call,

25:10.008 --> 25:13.428
the kid asked him,
"Dad, have you been paid? I want a car."

25:13.929 --> 25:17.015
So my brother lied to his son.

25:17.098 --> 25:19.017
He said he was working somewhere.

25:19.601 --> 25:21.478
"Yes, I'll get paid soon."

25:21.561 --> 25:26.942
So I had to help him out
and pay for those things

25:27.025 --> 25:29.110
so the kid wouldn't feel bad.

25:29.736 --> 25:31.821
I supported my whole family.

25:32.656 --> 25:34.616
I was in charge of two old folks.

25:35.283 --> 25:37.994
Since I worked
at Guillermo's butcher's shop,

25:38.078 --> 25:41.164
I was sometimes given
one or two kilos of meat.

25:41.248 --> 25:44.501
I'd tell Guillermo,
"Sell me that meat with a discount."

25:44.584 --> 25:46.336
And he'd say, "Just take it."

25:46.419 --> 25:48.588
I provided for my family.

25:49.089 --> 25:54.553
Traveling to Villahermosa, Macuspana…
costs money.

25:55.512 --> 25:58.515
It's an expense we have to cover.

26:05.188 --> 26:07.983
I'm the one who is in the bad situation.

26:09.192 --> 26:12.487
I had to put my foot down, and say,

26:12.571 --> 26:16.575
"You know what, Juan? You have to work.
You have no choice."

26:17.659 --> 26:20.328
I've learned how to make hammocks.

26:20.912 --> 26:21.997
I used to do blouses.

26:30.005 --> 26:34.092
Here, from when they open the cells,
at 7:00 a.m.,

26:34.175 --> 26:38.221
as we say here,
"We're stuck to the frame."

26:38.305 --> 26:40.390
We weave all day.

26:40.890 --> 26:42.392
Making a hammock

26:43.310 --> 26:46.563
takes about seven or eight days, at most.

26:47.105 --> 26:50.859
The hammock is there
until a client shows up.

26:50.942 --> 26:54.613
You sell it for 600 pesos,
and you buy materials again.

26:55.447 --> 26:58.700
Your profit is about 100, 130 pesos

26:59.367 --> 27:01.703
for making a hammock here.

27:07.709 --> 27:10.962
When he finishes them, I go pick them up.

27:11.046 --> 27:13.298
I sell them for him.

27:13.381 --> 27:15.175
As soon as I get paid,

27:15.258 --> 27:18.094
I buy whatever he needs.

27:21.014 --> 27:25.644
I never thought she would be the one
to spend the most time with me.

27:28.146 --> 27:32.484
I remember when we were kids…

27:33.818 --> 27:36.738
When I was about ten years old,

27:37.489 --> 27:38.907
we fought all the time.

27:39.449 --> 27:41.993
We need to do something here.

27:42.661 --> 27:45.955
We have to keep busy, you know?

27:46.039 --> 27:50.585
The hammocks are a good distraction,
they make the days go faster.

27:50.669 --> 27:52.545
If you do nothing,

27:52.629 --> 27:56.174
what's going round and round
in your head gets to you.

27:56.925 --> 27:59.761
You end up getting ill.

28:06.226 --> 28:07.936
If they saw how Darwin lives,

28:08.019 --> 28:10.397
the situation he and his family are in,

28:11.648 --> 28:14.609
they'd realize
that he doesn't kidnap people.

28:15.985 --> 28:18.947
You can't spend all the ransom money

28:19.030 --> 28:20.532
in two, three days.

28:20.615 --> 28:22.951
Some days, they have nothing to eat.

28:23.034 --> 28:26.371
If he works that day, they eat.
If not, they don't.

28:45.098 --> 28:49.561
The district attorney's office
has two very clear and "simple" jobs

28:49.644 --> 28:51.604
when it works properly.

28:51.688 --> 28:53.398
They need to prove the crime,

28:53.481 --> 28:58.903
and that the accused
are actually responsible for that crime.

28:58.987 --> 29:01.239
<i>We will now listen to the evidence.</i>

29:01.322 --> 29:03.491
<i>The first one is a DVD</i>,

29:03.575 --> 29:05.744
<i>which will be played now.</i>

29:05.827 --> 29:06.661
<i>Is it ready?</i>

29:07.370 --> 29:08.204
<i>Yes?</i>

29:08.705 --> 29:10.707
<i>Look, get the money for tomorrow</i>

29:10.790 --> 29:12.542
<i>or I'll send her in pieces.</i>

29:12.625 --> 29:13.752
<i>This is not a game.</i>

29:14.252 --> 29:15.378
<i>Hello?</i>

29:15.462 --> 29:16.379
<i>Hi, buddy.</i>

29:16.463 --> 29:20.550
<i>Can you get 50,000 more pesos?</i>
<i>I'll release your mom right now.</i>

29:21.301 --> 29:23.011
<i>Look, I just got here.</i>

29:23.094 --> 29:25.180
<i>I already have 109,000.</i>

29:25.263 --> 29:28.224
<i>Tomorrow, I'm meeting</i>
<i>some colleagues from work</i>

29:28.308 --> 29:30.018
<i>who will donate money.</i>

29:30.101 --> 29:31.936
<i>Why don't you call tomorrow?</i>

29:32.979 --> 29:35.190
<i>Please, say where you work.</i>

29:36.691 --> 29:38.485
<i>I work in Major Crimes.</i>

29:38.568 --> 29:40.069
PROSECUTION WITNESS

29:40.153 --> 29:42.781
<i>Please, state the reason</i>

29:42.864 --> 29:45.408
<i>why you are in this court.</i>

29:45.950 --> 29:50.121
<i>Sure. For a report I presented</i>
<i>on August 25th.</i>

29:50.205 --> 29:57.086
<i>The report details the communication</i>

29:57.170 --> 30:02.842
<i>between the presumed kidnappers</i>

30:02.926 --> 30:04.844
<i>and the victim's family.</i>

30:05.428 --> 30:07.013
<i>With your analysis,</i>

30:07.096 --> 30:10.391
<i>were you able to confirm</i>
<i>the identity of the kidnappers?</i>

30:13.102 --> 30:13.937
<i>No.</i>

30:14.020 --> 30:15.480
<i>Thanks. No further questions.</i>

30:17.899 --> 30:21.444
<i>More than 560 kidnappers</i>
<i>operating in Tabasco</i>

30:21.528 --> 30:23.655
<i>were arrested from 2013.</i>

30:23.738 --> 30:29.118
<i>Thus, at least 100 criminal gangs</i>
<i>of kidnappers were dismantled.</i>

30:29.202 --> 30:32.121
<i>In Tabasco, over 80 gangs</i>
<i>have been broken up,</i>

30:32.205 --> 30:36.084
<i>and almost 500 kidnappers</i>
<i>were arrested and taken to trial.</i>

30:36.167 --> 30:40.380
<i>The prosecutor's office of Tabasco</i>
<i>informed this Tuesday</i>

30:40.463 --> 30:44.384
<i>that they had dismantled</i>
<i>three gangs of kidnappers.</i>

30:44.467 --> 30:47.178
<i>Four gangs of kidnappers were dismantled</i>

30:47.262 --> 30:49.681
<i>in which at least</i>
<i>21 people were involved.</i>

30:49.764 --> 30:52.851
<i>Five kidnappers were arrested in Tabasco.</i>

30:52.934 --> 30:54.811
<i>The district attorney's office</i>

30:54.894 --> 30:58.022
<i>managed to break up</i>
<i>two gangs of kidnappers.</i>

30:58.106 --> 30:59.858
<i>We would like to remind you</i>

31:00.608 --> 31:04.571
<i>that, beyond the results and the numbers,</i>

31:04.654 --> 31:09.158
<i>which so far add up</i>
<i>to 400 arrested kidnappers</i>

31:09.242 --> 31:11.828
<i>under the current administration,</i>

31:11.911 --> 31:13.663
<i>the goal remains the same:</i>

31:14.289 --> 31:18.960
<i>to enforce justice for the well-being</i>
<i>and peace of mind of Tabasco's residents.</i>

31:19.043 --> 31:21.087
Since it is the most serious offense,

31:21.170 --> 31:24.465
the one that gets
the most attention from the media,

31:24.549 --> 31:28.970
what happens is
that the prosecutor's office

31:29.053 --> 31:32.140
or the State General Attorney's office
takes one route

31:32.223 --> 31:34.309
and arrests a group of people,

31:34.392 --> 31:38.187
and the local district attorney's office
arrests another group.

31:38.271 --> 31:41.691
They arrest different people
for the same kidnapping.

31:41.774 --> 31:44.277
OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

31:46.821 --> 31:49.073
VICTIM AID AND WITNESS PROTECTION

31:49.157 --> 31:52.368
Mrs. GLP identifies them
that very same night,

31:52.452 --> 31:53.578
on June 20th.

31:53.661 --> 31:56.748
She identifies them all,
and Darwin later, at about 3:00 a.m.

31:56.831 --> 31:58.249
A few days go by,

31:58.333 --> 32:01.878
and Mrs. GLP goes
to the national prosecutor's office,

32:01.961 --> 32:05.715
where she accuses other men
of kidnapping her.

32:06.299 --> 32:07.800
Criminal Case 33

32:08.426 --> 32:12.472
is a case where penal justice
is recorded and executed

32:12.555 --> 32:16.351
against a group of people

32:16.434 --> 32:19.520
that are known as the Potencianos.

32:20.229 --> 32:24.817
And GLP identified this group,
the Potencianos,

32:24.901 --> 32:27.320
as her kidnappers.

32:27.403 --> 32:30.573
So there is a very evident contradiction.

32:30.657 --> 32:34.953
Therefore, it is extremely important
that this document

32:35.036 --> 32:38.498
is taken into account
by the judges in charge of deciding

32:38.581 --> 32:43.461
if Héctor, Gonzalo, Juan Luis and Darwin
are responsible for GLP's kidnapping.

32:55.723 --> 32:56.766
Go on!

33:00.853 --> 33:01.896
Hello!

33:04.649 --> 33:06.693
Is Mrs. Gladis here?

33:07.694 --> 33:10.446
Tell her it's Eva.

33:10.530 --> 33:12.949
Can I speak to her for a moment?

33:14.075 --> 33:15.618
I don't want more trouble.

33:15.702 --> 33:18.121
You accuse me of this, of that…

33:18.204 --> 33:20.123
No, of course not. Not us.

33:20.206 --> 33:22.959
-I'm not scared, but I want no trouble.
-No…

33:23.042 --> 33:26.212
She said to us,
"Those men you are talking about,

33:26.295 --> 33:30.383
I don't know them,
I haven't identified them."

33:30.883 --> 33:34.554
So Eva told her,
"That's what we need you to say."

33:35.638 --> 33:39.726
But I haven't seen them.
I was kidnapped for eight days.

33:39.809 --> 33:41.436
I was blindfolded.

33:41.519 --> 33:44.772
I didn't see where I was
or who had taken me.

33:47.316 --> 33:53.072
My brother's lawyer made me say

33:53.573 --> 33:56.951
they were the kidnappers
and that was their car.

33:58.036 --> 34:00.329
We could see she was getting nervous.

34:00.413 --> 34:02.040
All she kept saying was,

34:02.123 --> 34:05.918
"You need to talk to my brother
about this, with Mr. ACP."

34:06.002 --> 34:08.046
"I didn't recognize them."

34:08.129 --> 34:11.758
"I was told before going in
what numbers I had to point at."

34:11.841 --> 34:15.386
"And if you're summoned to court,
will you go?"

34:15.470 --> 34:16.554
"Yes, sure."

34:16.637 --> 34:19.640
We were told that you refuse to testify,

34:19.724 --> 34:22.101
because you're scared they'll hurt you.

34:22.185 --> 34:24.937
Why would I be scared of them hurting me?

34:25.021 --> 34:26.939
That's what we're wondering. Why?

34:35.281 --> 34:41.204
716 DAYS IN PRISON
GLP TESTIFIES IN COURT

34:41.287 --> 34:43.206
I couldn't sleep yesterday.

34:44.540 --> 34:46.167
We don't know what…

34:46.918 --> 34:48.961
Only God knows what will happen.

34:49.712 --> 34:52.507
We've been here for about a year,

34:53.299 --> 34:55.551
a year and 11 months, almost two years.

34:56.344 --> 34:58.471
I hope to God everything goes well.

35:00.056 --> 35:02.058
Yes, I'm a bit nervous.

35:02.683 --> 35:04.936
I just hope the authorities do justice

35:05.686 --> 35:06.938
and not the opposite.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.609
Today is the hearing.

35:12.443 --> 35:13.402
And…

35:15.446 --> 35:19.242
The last hearing of the case
we're accused in.

35:20.910 --> 35:21.828
Public trial.

35:24.664 --> 35:27.750
It will be at ten in the morning.

35:31.003 --> 35:33.005
We're being called now.

35:33.089 --> 35:34.132
Héctor Muñoz!

35:35.550 --> 35:39.887
I just pray to God
that everything goes smoothly today.

35:41.556 --> 35:44.016
And I trust Him to give us freedom today.

36:04.871 --> 36:06.747
STATE POLICE

36:30.396 --> 36:33.149
It was a very emotionally intense day,

36:33.232 --> 36:37.570
the day the most important
witness for the prosecution would testify.

36:37.653 --> 36:40.364
And that day…

36:41.199 --> 36:43.326
we would have to prove

36:43.409 --> 36:46.621
that she was not being truthful

36:47.246 --> 36:49.832
and present the Criminal Case 33.

36:49.916 --> 36:51.667
The day we dropped the bomb.

36:56.505 --> 36:58.591
<i>-Careful!</i>
<i>-Watch the step.</i>

36:58.674 --> 36:59.508
<i>Go on.</i>

36:59.592 --> 37:01.302
<i>Easy, ma'am. It's okay.</i>

37:06.557 --> 37:08.517
<i>I won't remember everything,</i>

37:08.601 --> 37:12.772
<i>because it's been two years</i>
<i>since it happened.</i>

37:14.106 --> 37:19.278
<i>During the time you were kidnapped,</i>
<i>did you see anybody?</i>

37:20.488 --> 37:23.783
<i>Honestly, just one person, once.</i>

37:23.866 --> 37:25.409
<i>He was dark-skinned.</i>

37:25.493 --> 37:28.371
<i>He was watching me.</i>
<i>I didn't see anyone else.</i>

37:28.454 --> 37:31.749
<i>I was blindfolded the whole time.</i>
<i>I could only hear them.</i>

37:32.625 --> 37:36.003
<i>I heard a woman, kids,</i>
<i>but I never saw their faces.</i>

37:36.087 --> 37:40.341
<i>Ma'am, at the moment you were taken,</i>
<i>did you see anyone?</i>

37:41.926 --> 37:43.552
<i>No, I was shocked.</i>

37:44.095 --> 37:46.138
<i>I don't remember seeing anything.</i>

37:46.222 --> 37:49.308
<i>Please, state the reason</i>

37:50.643 --> 37:53.271
<i>why you couldn't recognize them.</i>

37:53.354 --> 37:54.897
<i>Because of my eyesight.</i>

37:54.981 --> 37:57.441
<i>I had surgery, and my vision is blurry.</i>

37:57.525 --> 38:01.612
<i>Even looking at you,</i>
<i>I see your face in darkness.</i>

38:01.696 --> 38:05.574
<i>I came because I was summoned,</i>
<i>but I'm not doing well.</i>

38:05.658 --> 38:07.243
When I heard…

38:07.994 --> 38:12.665
When I heard Mrs. GLP say that,

38:13.457 --> 38:14.959
I thought, "God, thanks."

38:15.668 --> 38:21.966
Because my family
had gone to see her at her house.

38:22.049 --> 38:24.051
And, I guess,

38:24.927 --> 38:28.597
that must have pulled
at her heartstrings, I don't know.

38:28.681 --> 38:31.767
She must have thought,
"It wasn't these men."

38:31.851 --> 38:35.146
<i>To be clear, you are saying</i>
<i>that you were not able to see</i>

38:35.229 --> 38:39.275
<i>any of the three men</i>
<i>that kidnapped you on May 26th?</i>

38:39.942 --> 38:42.695
<i>If I saw them, I wouldn't recognize them.</i>

38:42.778 --> 38:46.907
<i>Right, so you couldn't see them properly</i>
<i>because of your poor eyesight.</i>

38:46.991 --> 38:50.161
<i>Yes, that's right. What can I say?</i>

38:50.244 --> 38:52.496
<i>-I can't see well.</i>
<i>-You can't see well.</i>

38:52.580 --> 38:56.500
<i>So you couldn't identify the people</i>
<i>that kept you in the safe house?</i>

38:56.584 --> 38:57.793
<i>-No.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

38:58.794 --> 38:59.628
<i>That's all.</i>

39:02.798 --> 39:06.677
So he decides
not to bring up the Criminal Case 33

39:06.761 --> 39:08.971
and not to drop the bomb,

39:09.055 --> 39:12.350
because, in court,
Mrs. GLP states she didn't see anyone.

39:12.850 --> 39:15.561
<i>Will you start your questioning now?</i>

39:15.644 --> 39:17.438
<i>We won't present the evidence.</i>

39:17.521 --> 39:20.274
<i>No? Okay. The prosecution may proceed.</i>

39:20.358 --> 39:23.361
<i>The prosecution has proved</i>
<i>beyond a reasonable doubt</i>

39:23.444 --> 39:27.490
<i>that Mrs. GLP,</i>
<i>victim of undisclosed identity,</i>

39:27.573 --> 39:32.328
<i>was deprived of her freedom</i>
<i>on May 26th, 2015.</i>

39:32.411 --> 39:36.791
<i>The victim claimed that,</i>
<i>at the time, she did identify</i> <i>them,</i>

39:36.874 --> 39:39.085
<i>and that she gave a full statement</i>

39:39.168 --> 39:44.382
<i>to the officers</i>
<i>from the Anti-kidnapping Special Unit.</i>

39:44.965 --> 39:46.675
<i>Contrary to what they say,</i>

39:46.759 --> 39:51.097
<i>it was proved beyond a reasonable doubt</i>
<i>that Darwin, Gonzalo and Juan Luis</i>

39:51.180 --> 39:54.308
<i>weren't even close</i>
<i>to the location of the incident</i>

39:54.392 --> 39:57.561
<i>on the day and at the time</i>
<i>of the presumed kidnapping.</i>

39:58.437 --> 40:00.648
The atmosphere was very tense.

40:00.731 --> 40:04.485
You could hear the guys
holding on to the chairs and tables,

40:04.568 --> 40:06.278
because the wood was creaking.

40:06.362 --> 40:10.366
You could hear them tapping their shoes,
grinding their teeth.

40:10.449 --> 40:14.453
Alberto and I had a knot in our stomachs.
Anything could happen.

40:14.537 --> 40:18.374
<i>The court warns that the prosecution,</i>
<i>in its closing statements,</i>

40:18.457 --> 40:23.045
<i>misrepresented the testimony of the victim</i>
<i>heard in this court today,</i>

40:23.129 --> 40:28.717
<i>claiming that the victim,</i>
<i>apart from filing an official complaint,</i>

40:28.801 --> 40:33.139
<i>also participated in a police line-up</i>
<i>of the accused.</i>

40:33.222 --> 40:38.352
<i>The victim failed to mention these facts</i>
<i>when presenting her testimony today.</i>

40:38.936 --> 40:40.271
So we start hearing

40:40.354 --> 40:43.441
that she is paraphrasing
all our arguments.

40:43.524 --> 40:47.736
All the arguments we presented
in our closing speech.

40:47.820 --> 40:51.365
And I thought,
"That's it, they will release them."

40:51.449 --> 40:54.160
<i>Therefore, this court decides</i>

40:54.243 --> 40:57.079
<i>to rule in favor of</i>
<i>Juan Luis López García,</i>

40:57.163 --> 40:58.456
<i>Gonzalo García Hernández,</i>

40:58.539 --> 41:01.292
<i>Darwin Morales Ortiz</i>
<i>and Héctor Muñoz Muñoz,</i>

41:01.375 --> 41:03.419
<i>who shall be set free immediately.</i>

41:04.170 --> 41:05.421
We were free.

41:05.504 --> 41:06.589
In theory.

41:06.672 --> 41:12.386
Those 50 years we were going to get,
that the prosecution was fighting for…

41:13.012 --> 41:15.347
Thank goodness,

41:15.431 --> 41:18.476
we got a release document
that stated we were absolved.

41:18.559 --> 41:20.853
We were released, thank God.

41:23.314 --> 41:25.858
We hugged, we cried…

41:26.942 --> 41:28.861
We weren't found guilty.

41:29.403 --> 41:33.240
When I heard that, I felt so relieved.

41:33.324 --> 41:35.201
We were all very happy.

41:35.284 --> 41:38.245
The lawyers, because it was all over,

41:38.329 --> 41:41.540
and us, because this nightmare
was coming to an end.

41:42.041 --> 41:45.044
When I was told I had been found innocent,

41:45.127 --> 41:49.006
I felt a shiver down my spine,
I was so excited.

41:49.089 --> 41:51.425
I cried with happiness,

41:51.509 --> 41:53.260
because we were free.

41:54.303 --> 41:55.304
Bravo!

42:06.899 --> 42:09.693
-The lawyer wants to talk to us.
-It's over.

42:10.569 --> 42:13.822
-Raúl.
-We'll give you five minutes.

42:15.574 --> 42:18.077
"That's it, I'm going back to my family."

42:21.080 --> 42:24.250
But, unfortunately,
that's not what happened.

42:25.501 --> 42:27.670
They played a dirty trick on us.

42:28.170 --> 42:32.424
A couple of days prior,
they had issued the arrest warrant

42:32.508 --> 42:33.968
for ACP's case,

42:34.051 --> 42:36.845
which they had reopened
while we were on trial.

42:40.558 --> 42:42.017
Unfortunately,

42:42.101 --> 42:46.855
at that time, the only person
that could walk out free was Darwin,

42:46.939 --> 42:49.608
because he wasn't implicated
in the ACP case.

42:49.692 --> 42:51.944
There was an arrest warrant.

42:52.903 --> 42:54.655
For attempted kidnapping.

42:54.738 --> 43:00.119
It wasn't a kidnapping now,
it was the attempted kidnapping of ACP.

43:00.744 --> 43:04.456
What did the district attorney do?
What trick was she pulling?

43:05.708 --> 43:07.459
They played so dirty.

43:08.877 --> 43:11.755
When I saw my kids, I didn't say anything.

43:11.839 --> 43:14.508
I went straight to my son's room.

43:14.592 --> 43:19.597
I broke down completely,
and my mom asked what had happened.

43:20.306 --> 43:22.182
And I remember…

43:23.475 --> 43:27.146
feeling, that day,
that the world was falling apart.

43:28.439 --> 43:29.857
I felt a lot of things.

43:30.691 --> 43:32.484
They knew they'd lost.

43:32.568 --> 43:36.864
"We need to do something else
to keep these men in jail."

43:36.947 --> 43:40.618
We were devastated,
because we didn't understand.

43:40.701 --> 43:41.785
We still don't.

43:42.453 --> 43:47.082
We don't understand why those
who are supposed to administer justice

43:47.166 --> 43:48.792
would pull something like this.

43:51.879 --> 43:55.174
How is it possible
that the district attorney, Mrs. Delfín,

43:56.592 --> 43:59.470
signs their release papers
where she states,

43:59.553 --> 44:02.640
"I don't have sufficient evidence
to accuse them,"

44:02.723 --> 44:05.309
and, two years later,
without new evidence,

44:05.392 --> 44:06.685
she says,

44:06.769 --> 44:08.896
"I request an arrest warrant

44:08.979 --> 44:12.691
to start a criminal procedure
for the attempted kidnapping of ACP."

44:12.775 --> 44:13.609
You see?

44:13.692 --> 44:14.818
With this evidence,

44:15.319 --> 44:19.114
I set you free, because it is not enough.

44:19.198 --> 44:21.075
With the same evidence, I arrest you.

44:23.619 --> 44:26.664
It says,
"An arrest warrant has been issued."

44:26.747 --> 44:29.958
"Macuspana, Tabasco. May 16th, 2017."

44:31.585 --> 44:32.878
Since May 16th.

44:32.961 --> 44:35.673
"A warrant is issued
for the arrest of Juan Luis López García,

44:35.756 --> 44:38.801
Héctor Muñoz Muñoz
and Gonzalo García Hernández

44:38.884 --> 44:42.971
for the incident classified
as attempted kidnapping

44:43.055 --> 44:46.433
of the victim with the initials ACP."

44:47.017 --> 44:50.229
Which my brother
was arrested for on June 20th, 2015.

44:50.312 --> 44:53.941
The authorities will see
who actually committed the crime.

44:54.024 --> 44:56.485
Because what they're doing to my brother

44:56.568 --> 44:58.195
is an injustice again.

44:58.278 --> 44:59.530
Yet another injustice.

47:40.274 --> 47:45.279
