WEBVTT

00:05.539 --> 00:08.276
Male voice:
PREVIOUSLY ON
"IN TREATMENT"...

00:08.376 --> 00:10.444
ANDREW GAVE ME
AN ULTIMATUM--

00:10.544 --> 00:12.580
EITHER WE GET MARRIED
OR WE SPLIT.

00:12.680 --> 00:16.016
Paul:
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHY ANDREW
CHOSE THIS PARTICULAR TIME?

00:16.117 --> 00:19.287
Laura: WE WERE
HAVING DINNER AND HE SAID,
"I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANT.

00:19.387 --> 00:21.889
I JUST KNOW I DON'T
WANT THIS ON-AND-OFF THING."

00:21.989 --> 00:24.358
SO I SAID TO HIM,
"SURE," AND THEN,
"LET'S JUST DECIDE."

00:24.458 --> 00:26.127
SO YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO CAME UP WITH IT?

00:26.227 --> 00:29.097
NO NO NO, HE HAD THIS THING
WITH THIS ON-AND-OFF--

00:29.197 --> 00:31.399
THE ULTIM--

00:34.435 --> 00:35.436
I LOVE YOU.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.471
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
FELT LIKE THIS?

00:37.571 --> 00:40.741
A YEAR.
YOU'VE BECOME THE CENTER
OF MY LIFE.

00:40.841 --> 00:43.611
LAURA,
I'M YOUR THERAPIST.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.115
I'M NOT AN OPTION.

00:49.083 --> 00:52.586
( gurgling )

00:52.686 --> 00:54.655
KATE?

00:55.989 --> 00:58.192
KATE?

00:59.793 --> 01:01.595
( gurgling )

01:01.695 --> 01:03.331
KATE?

01:03.431 --> 01:04.365
WHAT?

01:04.465 --> 01:07.168
CAN YOU COME HERE
A MINUTE?

01:08.936 --> 01:10.938
( sighs )

01:11.038 --> 01:14.074
THIS THING IS--
THIS IS CLOGGED UP AGAIN.

01:14.175 --> 01:16.544
CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR?
CAN YOU CALL THE--

01:16.644 --> 01:18.746
THE PLUMBER, TELL HIM
TO COME OVER HERE,

01:18.846 --> 01:20.481
GET IT FIXED?

01:20.581 --> 01:22.616
I GOT A SESSION STARTING
IN ABOUT A MINUTE.

01:22.716 --> 01:25.786
OKAY, BUT YOU REALIZE HE
WON'T BE ABLE TO COME TODAY,

01:25.886 --> 01:27.355
RIGHT?

01:27.455 --> 01:29.857
JUST HAVE YOUR PATIENTS GO
TO THE DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM.

01:29.957 --> 01:31.992
OH CHRIST.
YOU CAN'T BE BLOODY SERIOUS.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.827
WHY NOT?
WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?

01:33.927 --> 01:36.597
- IT DOESN'T MATTER, IT'S OKAY.
- WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL?

01:36.697 --> 01:38.666
THERE'S NO BIG DEAL.
I'LL DO IT MYSELF.
NEVER MIND.

01:38.766 --> 01:41.602
I'LL GET DENNIS THAT
HANDYMAN GUY TO COME
OVER AND DO IT.

01:41.702 --> 01:43.471
OH YEAH, WELL, GOOD.
DENNIS WILL FIX IT.

01:43.571 --> 01:45.306
AND THEN IT'LL JUST GET
CLOGGED UP AGAIN NEXT WEEK.

01:45.406 --> 01:46.907
IT'LL BE FINE,
I PROMISE YOU.

01:47.007 --> 01:48.609
WHAT IS THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

01:48.709 --> 01:50.511
THERE IS NOTHING
THE MATTER WITH ME.

01:50.611 --> 01:53.447
I'VE GOT A SESSION STARTING
IN A MINUTE. PLEASE.

01:53.547 --> 01:55.583
( dialing )

01:56.617 --> 01:58.752
( sighs )

01:58.852 --> 02:00.120
( chuckles )

02:00.221 --> 02:02.156
OH, YOU'RE FINISHED
WITH ME NOW? OKAY.

02:02.256 --> 02:04.024
I FORGOT.
I SHOULD GO.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.560
( footsteps recede )

02:10.898 --> 02:12.800
( knocking )

02:20.808 --> 02:23.143
( theme music playing )

03:12.793 --> 03:14.928
OKAY, SO I SAID YES.

03:16.930 --> 03:18.165
TO ANDREW.

03:18.266 --> 03:20.133
WE ALREADY SET A DATE.

03:20.234 --> 03:22.135
IT'S GONNA BE
THE THIRD WEEKEND IN JUNE.

03:22.236 --> 03:24.572
YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY
GETS MARRIED IN JUNE.

03:24.672 --> 03:26.474
SO--

03:26.574 --> 03:29.943
SO YOU'LL BE
A SUMMER BRIDE.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.346
EVIDENTLY SO.

03:35.182 --> 03:38.085
WELL,
CONGRATULATIONS.

03:38.185 --> 03:39.987
THANK YOU.

03:43.491 --> 03:45.593
SO ARE YOU HAPPY
FOR US?

03:47.395 --> 03:48.929
IS THAT IMPORTANT TO YOU?

03:49.029 --> 03:51.399
WELL, IF YOU'RE GONNA BE
A GUEST AT OUR WEDDING,

03:51.499 --> 03:53.834
YOU'D BETTER BE
HAPPY FOR US.

03:55.035 --> 03:56.937
ANDREW AND I WANTED
TO INVITE YOU.

03:57.037 --> 03:58.739
YOUR WIFE TOO.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.941
BUT YOU WOULDN'T COME,
RIGHT? WOULD YOU?

04:01.041 --> 04:03.944
NO, OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T.
BUT WE DID ACTUALLY TALK
ABOUT IT YESTERDAY.

04:04.044 --> 04:07.281
RIGHT AFTER I SAID YES
WE STARTED MAKING A GUEST LIST

04:07.381 --> 04:11.151
AND FOR A FEW MINUTES
THERE YOU WERE ON IT.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.153
WAIT A MINUTE,
YOU SAID YES

04:13.253 --> 04:15.155
JUST YESTERDAY?

04:15.255 --> 04:18.592
YEAH. I COULDN'T
MAKE UP MY MIND.

04:18.692 --> 04:22.195
IT TOOK ME A FEW DAYS
TO GET OVER THE OTHER NIGHT
AND OUR SESSION.

04:22.296 --> 04:25.333
I, UH-- I WANTED
TO CALM DOWN FIRST.

04:25.433 --> 04:28.836
ANDREW WAS COOL WITH THAT.
HE SAID A DAY HERE OR THERE
WOULDN'T MATTER

04:28.936 --> 04:32.706
AS LONG AS I WAS MOVING
TOWARD A DECISION.

04:32.806 --> 04:36.910
YOU KNOW, HE'S VERY HAPPY
THAT YOU'RE HELPING ME.

04:38.712 --> 04:40.748
FOR A WHILE THERE HE THOUGHT
HE'D MADE A MISTAKE

04:40.848 --> 04:43.584
RECOMMENDING THAT
I COME SEE YOU.
HE SAID THAT.

04:43.684 --> 04:46.119
BUT HE THINK YOU'RE
AN AMAZING THERAPIST

04:46.219 --> 04:48.188
AND THAT HIS INSTINCTS
WERE JUST RIGHT

04:48.288 --> 04:51.425
AND THAT YOU'RE
ON OUR SIDE.

04:58.031 --> 04:59.600
WHAT?

05:02.035 --> 05:03.737
( sighs )
I GUESS I'M--

05:03.837 --> 05:07.475
I'M JUST TRYING TO
GET USED TO--

05:07.575 --> 05:09.042
TO THE CHANGE IN TONE.

05:09.142 --> 05:12.946
YOU'RE SPEAKING IN
THE PLURAL.

05:13.046 --> 05:16.249
WELL, I'M GONNA
BE A "WE,"

05:16.350 --> 05:18.419
AN "US,"
AREN'T I?

05:18.519 --> 05:20.821
YOU SAY THAT LIKE
YOU'RE NOT SO SURE.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.756
NO, I'M SURE.

05:22.856 --> 05:26.126
YOU KNOW, PAUL,
I'M-- I'M GENERALLY OPEN
TO YOUR INTERPRETATIONS,

05:26.226 --> 05:29.096
BUT RIGHT NOW IT JUST
SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE TRYING
TO BE A BIT OF A--

05:29.196 --> 05:30.431
KILLJOY?

05:30.531 --> 05:32.900
KILLJOY, YES,
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
SO DON'T.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.371
ESPECIALLY SINCE JOY IS
A VERY RARE THING WHEN
IT COMES TO ME.

05:41.909 --> 05:43.944
WHAT?

05:44.945 --> 05:47.381
I'M--

05:48.749 --> 05:50.951
I'M JUST WONDERING IF
YOU CAME HERE TODAY

05:51.051 --> 05:53.253
DETERMINED TO, UH,

05:53.353 --> 05:55.255
DEMONSTRATE THAT JOY,

05:55.355 --> 05:57.858
ESPECIALLY AFTER
LAST WEEK'S EVENTS.

05:57.958 --> 05:59.460
I'M ASKING MYSELF

05:59.560 --> 06:01.462
IF THIS ISN'T
A BIT TOO FAST,

06:01.562 --> 06:04.064
IF YOU HAVEN'T PERHAPS
TAKEN A SHORTCUT.

06:04.164 --> 06:05.766
YOU THINK THAT
I'M FAKING THIS?

06:05.866 --> 06:07.801
THAT I'M ACTUALLY
TOTALLY DEPRESSED?

06:07.901 --> 06:09.903
WELL, MAYBE IT'S YOU
THAT'S FAKING IT, HUH?

06:10.003 --> 06:13.474
I MEAN, THAT
CONGRATULATIONS WAS A BIT
LABORED, DON'T YOU THINK?

06:26.353 --> 06:27.955
I--

06:28.055 --> 06:31.959
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
SCUBA DIVING?

06:33.527 --> 06:37.631
THEY HAVE THIS THING
THAT'S CALLED THE BENDS.

06:37.731 --> 06:40.834
IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS
WHEN THE DIVERS

06:40.934 --> 06:44.304
COME UP TO
THE SURFACE TOO QUICKLY.
IT'S REALLY DANGEROUS.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.607
IT CAN EXPLODE YOUR LUNGS

06:46.707 --> 06:49.309
FROM THE SUDDEN
CHANGES IN PRESSURE.

06:49.409 --> 06:52.713
ANYWAY IT-- IT SEEMS
LIKE THERE'S--

06:52.813 --> 06:56.316
THERE'S A HUGE GAP
BETWEEN

06:56.416 --> 06:59.887
THE DEPTHS THAT
YOU REACHED LAST WEEK

06:59.987 --> 07:03.056
AND THE HEIGHTS

07:03.156 --> 07:06.660
AT WHICH YOU ARE TODAY.
I'M JUST TRYING TO--

07:06.760 --> 07:08.929
I'M JUST TRYING TO
ADJUST MYSELF

07:09.029 --> 07:11.198
SO THAT I DON'T,
I GUESS,

07:11.298 --> 07:13.567
COME TO THE SURFACE
TOO QUICKLY.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.206
( laughs )

07:21.208 --> 07:23.343
DO YOU DIVE, PAUL?

07:23.443 --> 07:25.546
YES.

07:27.815 --> 07:30.751
I-- WELL,
WE USED TO.

07:30.851 --> 07:33.787
OOH, WHO'S SPEAKING
IN THE PLURAL NOW?

07:33.887 --> 07:35.756
( chuckles )

07:35.856 --> 07:39.059
I CAN'T IMAGINE YOU DIVING.

07:39.159 --> 07:41.161
( laughs )

07:42.162 --> 07:44.498
WHERE'D YOU GO?
MEXICO?

07:44.598 --> 07:46.834
THE CARIBBEAN?

07:46.934 --> 07:51.238
ARE YOU INTERESTED IN
SCUBA DIVING?

07:51.338 --> 07:53.707
I'M A CERTIFIED DIVER.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.644
I KNOW WHAT
THE BENDS ARE.

07:57.778 --> 07:58.879
SORRY.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.948
NO, SERIOUSLY, I DOVE
A LOT BEFORE I MET ANDREW.

08:01.048 --> 08:03.216
HE-- HE HATES IT.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.953
IT'S CLAUSTROPHOBIC.

08:07.420 --> 08:10.223
IT'S NICE TO FIND WE
HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON,
YOU AND ME.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.159
ISN'T IT?

08:24.738 --> 08:26.807
WHERE ARE YOU NOW, LAURA?

08:29.509 --> 08:32.379
I JUST HAD A SCARY THOUGHT.
I JUST--

08:32.479 --> 08:34.648
I KNOW IT'S SILLY, BUT...

08:34.748 --> 08:37.417
BEFOREHAND WHEN YOU
SAID YOUR--

08:37.517 --> 08:39.486
YOUR LUNGS COULD EXPLODE,

08:39.587 --> 08:42.856
I DON'T KNOW, IT'S JUST
THE THOUGHT THAT SOMETHING
MIGHT HAPPEN TO YOU.

08:42.956 --> 08:45.158
YET YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
ASCENDED SO FAST.

08:45.258 --> 08:49.797
YOU KNOW WHAT, PAUL?
I DON'T WANT A DEPRESSING
SESSION.

08:49.897 --> 08:51.799
I WANT A HAPPY SESSION.
I CAME WITH GOOD NEWS,

08:51.899 --> 08:54.301
SO SHOW A LITTLE SUPPORT.

08:56.269 --> 08:58.606
OKAY.

09:04.044 --> 09:07.080
OKAY, YESTERDAY
I WAS AT NATALIE'S--

09:07.180 --> 09:10.083
YOU KNOW, ANDREW'S EX--
AND GARY THE HUSBAND,

09:10.183 --> 09:12.720
THE ONES WHO HAD
A BABY A FEW MONTHS AGO--

09:12.820 --> 09:15.322
AND THEY KEEP CALLING,
YOU KNOW, TO INVITE US OVER

09:15.422 --> 09:16.857
AND I KEEP AVOIDING THEM.

09:16.957 --> 09:19.259
BUT YESTERDAY WHEN THEY CALLED
TO INVITE US OVER FOR BRUNCH--

09:19.359 --> 09:20.961
WELL, ANYWAY,
GARY MAKES DIM SUM.

09:21.061 --> 09:24.497
I SWEAR, PAUL, HE HAS
THOSE BAMBOO STEAMERS
AND EVERYTHING.

09:24.598 --> 09:26.499
SO I SAID TO ANDREW,
"OKAY, LET'S GO."

09:26.600 --> 09:28.035
I MEAN, HE'S BEING SO
SWEET TO ME ALL WEEK,

09:28.135 --> 09:29.770
I THOUGHT THIS IS
THE LEAST I COULD DO.

09:29.870 --> 09:32.405
SO HIS AGREEING TO
POSTPONE THE ULTIMATUM,

09:32.505 --> 09:36.610
THAT DIS--
DISARMED YOU?

09:38.311 --> 09:39.813
( sighs )

09:39.913 --> 09:43.583
ALL RIGHT.
GO AHEAD.

09:43.684 --> 09:46.954
THEY HAVE A BABY,
THESE HUGE EYES.

09:47.054 --> 09:50.758
I MEAN, THE BABY IS--
THE BABY'S ALL EYES.
SO BEAUTIFUL.

09:50.858 --> 09:52.092
AND THE WAY HE BREASTFEEDS--

09:52.192 --> 09:54.895
ALL MORNING HE WAS ATTACHED
TO NATALIE'S NIPPLE.

09:54.995 --> 09:57.765
THIS-- THIS HUGE
DARK NIPPLE.

09:57.865 --> 09:59.299
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
LIKE IT IN MY LIFE.

09:59.399 --> 10:03.436
AND AT ONE POINT SHE
TOOK HER BOOB OUT OF
THE BABY'S MOUTH

10:03.536 --> 10:06.306
AND SQUEEZED IT AND
SOME MILK SQUIRTED OUT.

10:06.406 --> 10:10.110
AND I LOOK OVER AT ANDREW
AND HE HAS THIS ADMIRING
SMILE ON HIS FACE.

10:10.210 --> 10:14.547
YOU KNOW, LIKE HE WAS
LOOKING AT SOME MASTERPIECE
IN A MUSEUM,

10:14.648 --> 10:17.284
LIKE "THE MADONNA."

10:18.752 --> 10:20.821
WHAT DO YOU THINK HE SAW?

10:23.857 --> 10:27.895
MAYBE AN IMAGE OF YOU AND HE
TOGETHER IN THE FUTURE, MAYBE?

10:30.931 --> 10:34.702
OR MAYBE HE JUST
MISSES HER TITS.

10:35.869 --> 10:39.673
NO, NOT REALLY.
THEY'RE NOT THAT NICE.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.811
( chuckles )

10:43.911 --> 10:47.347
SHE'S CHANGED A LOT
SINCE SHE HAD THE BABY.

10:47.447 --> 10:48.849
IN WHAT WAY?

10:48.949 --> 10:50.550
I DON'T KNOW.
I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW
HER BEFORE,

10:50.650 --> 10:52.552
BUT ANDREW TOLD ME
A LOT ABOUT HER.

10:52.652 --> 10:55.355
HE SAID SHE WAS
THIS WILD TYPE, YOU KNOW,

10:55.455 --> 10:57.624
WHO HAD A LOT OF GUYS
CHASING HER.

10:57.725 --> 10:59.893
SHE PUT HIM THROUGH HELL.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.295
HE SAID THEY'D GO TO BED
AND SHE'D BE ONE PERSON

11:02.395 --> 11:05.833
AND THEN THEY'D WAKE UP
AND SHE'D BE SOMEONE
TOTALLY NEW.

11:05.933 --> 11:09.336
A FREE RADICAL, THAT'S WHAT
HE USED TO CALL HER.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.906
HE SAYS I REMIND HIM
OF HER.

11:14.607 --> 11:16.009
HMM.

11:16.109 --> 11:18.846
THAT'S SCARY.
LIKE THIS IS WHAT'S
LEFT OF HER.

11:18.946 --> 11:21.181
THE FRONT OF HER T-SHIRT
SOAKING WET

11:21.281 --> 11:23.583
AND NIPPLES-- NIPPLES--
THAT'S ALL THAT'S LEFT.

11:23.683 --> 11:27.154
SHE'S LIKE A WILD ANIMAL
THAT'S SOMEHOW BEEN--

11:27.254 --> 11:29.322
SHIT, WHAT'S THE WORD?

11:29.422 --> 11:30.623
DOMESTICATED?

11:30.724 --> 11:32.459
YEAH, DOMESTICATED.
SHE LOOKED DOMESTICATED--

11:32.559 --> 11:33.693
HOUSEBROKEN.

11:33.794 --> 11:35.595
SHE SAID HER WILDEST
SEXUAL FANTASY

11:35.695 --> 11:37.430
WAS TO SLEEP
FOUR HOURS STRAIGHT.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.066
( clears throat )

11:39.166 --> 11:42.569
- DOES THAT SCARE YOU
A LITTLE?
- OH MY GOD.

11:42.669 --> 11:44.404
I'D DIE IF I TURNED INTO
A LOUSY LAY.

11:44.504 --> 11:48.008
YOU KNOW, SOMEONE WHO
GETS FUCKED IN HER SLEEP
AND CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER.

11:48.108 --> 11:50.844
DO YOU THINK THAT'S
WHAT HAPPENS TO PEOPLE
AFTER THEY GET MARRIED?

11:50.944 --> 11:54.081
I DON'T KNOW.
DOES IT?

11:56.516 --> 11:59.719
IS SEX SOMETHING YOU FORGET
HOW TO DO, OR IS IT LIKE
RIDING A BIKE?

11:59.820 --> 12:03.323
I THINK THAT DEPENDS
ON THE--

12:03.423 --> 12:04.758
ON THE COUPLE.

12:04.858 --> 12:07.895
OF COURSE, SEX

12:07.995 --> 12:11.264
CAN BE
A SUBTERFUGE.

12:11.364 --> 12:13.333
- IT CAN--
- PAUL.

12:19.139 --> 12:21.208
OKAY.

12:21.308 --> 12:22.742
OKAY.
( laughs )

12:22.843 --> 12:25.745
SO ANYWAY, WHEN I GO--
I GO TO THE KITCHEN TO
HELP OUT WITH SOMETHING.

12:25.846 --> 12:29.716
AND WHEN I COME BACK
ANDREW AND GARY ARE ENGROSSED
IN THIS DEEP CONVERSATION

12:29.817 --> 12:32.219
ABOUT-- YOU WON'T BELIEVE
THIS-- UPHOLSTERERS.

12:32.319 --> 12:35.255
THERE'S THIS UPHOLSTERER
WHO REDID THEIR ENTIRE
LIVING ROOM.

12:35.355 --> 12:38.425
ANDREW'S TAKING DOWN
THE GUY'S NUMBER AND I'M LIKE,
"WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"

12:38.525 --> 12:40.861
AND HE SAID, "WELL, YOU KNOW,
YOU AND I DISCUSSED,

12:40.961 --> 12:43.163
YOU KNOW, RECOVERING THOSE
ARMCHAIRS YOUR DAD GAVE YOU."

12:43.263 --> 12:45.398
I'M TELLING YOU, PAUL,
WE NEVER DISCUSSED THIS.

12:45.498 --> 12:49.536
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN
ANDREW'S REUPHOLSTERING
ARMCHAIRS?

12:49.636 --> 12:52.672
I MEAN, WE'RE TALKING
METROSEXUAL.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.942
UM, THAT DOESN'T SOUND
VERY MUCH LIKE

12:55.042 --> 12:56.977
THE ANDREW THAT YOU'VE
BEEN TALKING ABOUT.

12:57.077 --> 12:58.078
EXACTLY.

12:58.178 --> 13:01.448
I MEAN, THIS WAS BEYOND
METROSEXUAL.

13:04.017 --> 13:06.186
DO YOU EVER WATCH
"THE ANIMAL PLANET"?

13:06.286 --> 13:09.089
YEAH, WELL IT WAS ABOUT
THIS TYPE OF BIRD.

13:09.189 --> 13:11.158
I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME
OF IT, BUT ANYWAY,

13:11.258 --> 13:15.195
THE MALE BIRD BUILDS
A NEST FOR THE FEMALE--

13:15.295 --> 13:20.300
YOU KNOW, THESE AMAZINGLY
INTRICATE STRUCTURES.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.801
THEY'RE INCREDIBLE.

13:21.902 --> 13:25.338
ANYWAY, THE FEMALE GOES
FROM NEST TO NEST,

13:25.438 --> 13:28.808
YOU KNOW, CHECKING OUT
ALL HER VARIOUS MATING OPTIONS,

13:28.909 --> 13:31.178
TRYING TO
MAKE UP HER MIND,

13:31.278 --> 13:33.646
WHILE THE MALE BIRD IS
DESPERATELY FLAPPING ABOUT,

13:33.746 --> 13:38.318
YOU KNOW, AND TRYING
TO ATTRACT THE FEMALE
WITH HIS ARCHITECTURE.

13:40.220 --> 13:43.590
YOU KNOW, THE NESTS
LOOK LIKE CAGES.

13:47.394 --> 13:49.596
ANYWAY...

13:49.696 --> 13:53.867
THE WHOLE WAY HOME,
I THOUGHT I WOULDN'T BE
ABLE TO FIGHT THIS ANYMORE.

13:53.967 --> 13:56.336
SO WHEN WE GOT NEAR
THE HOUSE

13:56.436 --> 13:59.172
WE-- WE WERE ABOUT TO PARK
AND ANDREW SAID TO ME,

13:59.272 --> 14:01.508
"DO YOU WANT TO GO
TO THE MOVIES OR STAY HOME?"

14:01.608 --> 14:03.543
AND I SAID--

14:03.643 --> 14:05.578
I SAID, "YES."

14:05.678 --> 14:08.882
AND HE SAYS, "YES, THE MOVIES?"
AND I SAID, "YES,

14:08.982 --> 14:11.618
I'LL-- I'LL MARRY YOU.

14:12.652 --> 14:15.488
YES.
I MEAN, FUCK IT.

14:15.588 --> 14:18.992
FUCK, I'LL MARRY YOU.
YES."

14:21.694 --> 14:23.530
HMM.

14:23.630 --> 14:26.166
SO WHERE DO
YOU THINK THIS

14:26.266 --> 14:28.501
"FUCK IT, YES,"
CAME FROM

14:28.601 --> 14:31.671
WHEN EVERYTHING
THAT YOU'VE BEEN
SAYING TO ANDREW,

14:31.771 --> 14:34.541
EVERYTHING THAT
YOU'VE BEEN DOING
FOR THAT PAST FEW WEEKS

14:34.641 --> 14:38.278
HAS ACTUALLY BEEN
ONE BIG NO?

14:38.378 --> 14:40.847
MEANING WHAT?
YOU THINK ANDREW TOOK ME THERE

14:40.948 --> 14:43.283
AS SOME SORT OF
OBJECT LESSON?

14:43.383 --> 14:46.186
TO SHOW ME HOW GOOD
IT COULD BE FOR US?
'CAUSE I DON'T THINK SO.

14:46.286 --> 14:49.422
I MEAN, ANDREW'S A PRETTY
MEDIOCRE PSYCHOLOGIST.

14:49.522 --> 14:50.790
( chuckles )

14:50.890 --> 14:52.926
WOULD YOU LISTEN TO ME.
I JUST SAID YES

14:53.026 --> 14:55.062
AND I'M ALREADY BAD-MOUTHING
MY FUTURE HUSBAND.

14:55.162 --> 14:57.830
YOU DIDN'T ANSWER
MY QUESTION, LAURA.

14:57.931 --> 15:00.900
WHERE DID THIS YES
COME FROM?

15:07.774 --> 15:12.445
YOU REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY I SAID YES TO HIM?

15:14.047 --> 15:17.917
IT WAS BECAUSE
YOU SAID NO TO ME.

15:21.288 --> 15:24.224
BECAUSE-- BECAUSE
I SAID NO TO YOU?

15:24.324 --> 15:28.261
I MEAN, THE WHOLE SITUATION
IS JUST ONE BIG FUCKING NO.

15:28.361 --> 15:31.098
I'M NOT BLAMING YOU.
I'M NOT ACCUSING YOU.
I'M JUST...

15:31.198 --> 15:33.500
DID YOU EXPECT
A DIFFERENT REACTION?

15:36.036 --> 15:40.107
IN YOUR FANTASY...

15:41.208 --> 15:44.077
HOW WOULD I RESPOND
TO YOU SAYING

15:44.177 --> 15:47.480
THAT YOU ARE,
UM, LET'S SAY,

15:47.580 --> 15:48.815
"IN LOVE WITH ME"?

15:48.915 --> 15:51.018
FIRST OF ALL, TAKE
THE QUOTATION MARKS

15:51.118 --> 15:53.053
OFF THE "IN LOVE WITH ME."

15:53.153 --> 15:55.688
IT'S INSULTING.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.257
AND STOP WITH
THE FANTASY TALK,

15:57.357 --> 16:01.161
BECAUSE FANTASIES ARE FOR
SILLY LITTLE GIRLS.

16:01.261 --> 16:03.230
YOU KNOW, WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT REALITY, PAUL,

16:03.330 --> 16:04.897
WHICH IS THAT
I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU.

16:04.998 --> 16:06.899
- BUT I STILL--
- THAT'S REALITY.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.436
I STILL WANT TO TALK
ABOUT FANTASIES

16:09.536 --> 16:10.870
FOR A MINUTE.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.140
NOT THE FANTASY
OF A SILLY LITTLE GIRL,

16:13.240 --> 16:16.209
BUT THE FANTASY OF
A GROWN SMART WOMAN.

16:16.309 --> 16:19.112
OH PLEASE, LET'S NOT DO THAT.
THAT'S BENEATH MY DIGNITY.

16:19.212 --> 16:21.681
WELL, I DON'T THINK THERE'S
ANYTHING BENEATH OUR DIGNITY

16:21.781 --> 16:24.884
IF IT TAKES US SOMEPLACE
OUR DIGNITY REFUSES TO GO.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.287
( sighs )

16:42.235 --> 16:44.137
YOU REMEMBER THAT STORY
YOU TOLD ME

16:44.237 --> 16:46.939
ABOUT THAT SUMMER WHEN YOU WERE
15 YEARS OLD IN SAN DIEGO?

16:47.040 --> 16:50.577
THAT COUPLE YOU LIVED WITH,
THE ONES WHO HAD NO CHILDREN,

16:50.677 --> 16:52.812
DAVID AND CELIA?

16:52.912 --> 16:54.947
YOU SAID THAT
SUMMER WAS--

16:55.048 --> 16:58.518
WAS VERY
SIGNIFICANT TO YOU.

16:58.618 --> 16:59.986
OH MY GOD.

17:00.087 --> 17:01.954
MY MOTHER HAD
JUST DIED, PAUL.

17:02.055 --> 17:05.058
OF COURSE IT WAS SIGNIFICANT.
WHAT'S THE POINT IN
REHASHING ALL THIS?

17:05.158 --> 17:07.327
I MEAN, MY MOTHER DIED
AND I WAS VERY LUCKY

17:07.427 --> 17:09.996
TO HAVE SOMEBODY TAKING ME
IN FOR A FEW MONTHS.
I MEAN, SO?

17:10.097 --> 17:13.433
I JUST WANT TO GO BACK
TO THAT PERIOD FOR A LITTLE
BIT IF YOU DON'T MIND.

17:13.533 --> 17:17.404
YOUR-- YOUR MOTHER
WAS GONE.

17:17.504 --> 17:19.906
YOUR MOTHER WAS YOUR
LAST WALL OF PROTECTION

17:20.006 --> 17:25.678
AGAINST YOUR FATHER--
FROM YOUR FATHER'S--
HOW DID YOU PUT IT?

17:25.778 --> 17:26.979
- UH...
- TOXIC FUMES.

17:27.080 --> 17:28.448
TOXIC FUMES, YES.

17:28.548 --> 17:32.219
HIS LONELINESS, HIS FEARS,
HIS DEPENDENCY ON YOU.

17:32.319 --> 17:34.854
YOU SAID THAT HE'D CALL
YOU UP IN CALIFORNIA

17:34.954 --> 17:36.956
AND SAY HOW UNHAPPY
HE WAS

17:37.056 --> 17:39.692
AND HOW MUCH
HE MISSED YOUR MOTHER

17:39.792 --> 17:43.463
AND BEGGING YOU TO
CUT YOUR VACATION SHORT
AND COME BACK HOME.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.965
WHAT'S THIS GOT
TO DO WITH ANYTHING?

17:46.065 --> 17:49.001
YOU TOOK A LIKING TO
THESE PEOPLE WHO WERE

17:49.102 --> 17:51.304
ATHLETIC AND HEALTHY

17:51.404 --> 17:54.541
AND THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF
YOUR PARENTS IN EVERY WAY.

17:54.641 --> 17:58.411
AND YOU DESCRIBED DAVID
VERY VIVIDLY.

17:59.979 --> 18:03.283
AND YOU SAID HE WAS
VERY KIND TO YOU.

18:03.383 --> 18:05.852
YEAH, YOU KNOW, HE USED
TO TAKE ME CAMPING.

18:05.952 --> 18:08.355
WE'D-- WE'D GO SURFING;

18:08.455 --> 18:11.958
USED TO JUST TALK
ABOUT STUFF, YOU KNOW?

18:12.058 --> 18:13.960
TEENAGE BULLSHIT.

18:14.060 --> 18:16.129
YOU--

18:16.229 --> 18:18.731
YOU WERE VERY
ATTRACTED TO HIM.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.969
HE WAS A HUNK, YEAH.

18:23.069 --> 18:26.206
HE LOOKED LIKE
NICK NOLTE.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.777
THEY SMOKED
A LOT OF GRASS.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.145
A LOT OF GRASS.

18:32.245 --> 18:34.747
I SMOKED WITH THEM.
IT WAS MY FIRST TIME.

18:37.584 --> 18:39.719
AND...

18:39.819 --> 18:43.156
WHEN THAT SUMMER
WAS OVER,

18:43.256 --> 18:45.625
THEY SAID IT WAS A SHAME
THEY COULDN'T ADOPT YOU.

18:45.725 --> 18:49.962
THEY SAID, "WE WANT
A DAUGHTER JUST LIKE YOU."

18:50.062 --> 18:54.100
YEAH, I ACTUALLY ASKED THEM
TO SEE IF IT WAS POSSIBLE.

18:54.201 --> 18:57.937
IF THERE WAS SOME
LEGAL WAY TO-- ANYWAY,
THEY JUST LAUGHED AT ME.

18:58.037 --> 19:00.006
THEY DIDN'T
TAKE ME SERIOUSLY.

19:00.106 --> 19:03.543
THEY SAID I WAS SO CUTE.

19:03.643 --> 19:07.046
ACTUALLY, I WANTED
HIM TO ADOPT ME.

19:07.146 --> 19:10.883
SHE WAS GREAT-- CELIA.
BUT, YOU KNOW, I WAS 15.

19:13.186 --> 19:16.323
I WANTED HIM ALL TO MYSELF.

19:17.023 --> 19:18.658
HMM.

19:18.758 --> 19:22.094
MAKES A LOT OF SENSE
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

19:22.195 --> 19:24.931
YOU WERE 15 YEARS OLD,

19:25.031 --> 19:27.967
YOUR FATHER
WAS GRIEVING,

19:28.067 --> 19:30.270
COMPLETELY DEPENDENT
ON YOU.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.739
DAVID MUST HAVE SEEMED
LIKE A LIFE RAFT.

19:35.408 --> 19:37.944
JUST AS JUST PERHAPS
I AM NOW

19:38.044 --> 19:40.347
FROM ANDREW.

19:41.848 --> 19:45.818
PERHAPS I'M AN ALTERNATIVE
TO EVERYTHING THAT
ANDREW REPRESENTS--

19:45.918 --> 19:49.756
DEPENDENCY, ANXIETY.

19:49.856 --> 19:54.026
BUT I AM NOT A REALISTIC
OPTION FOR YOU, LAURA.

19:54.126 --> 19:57.697
THIS IS A SAFE PLACE
WHERE YOU CAN COME,

19:57.797 --> 20:00.733
LIKE DAVID AT THE BEACH.

20:00.833 --> 20:04.637
- YES, BUT WITH
ONE BIG DIFFERENCE.
- WHAT'S THAT?

20:04.737 --> 20:08.341
I DON'T WANT YOU TO ADOPT ME,
I WANT YOU TO FUCK ME.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.556
I NEED TO PEE.

20:26.693 --> 20:28.127
OH, THERE'S--

20:28.227 --> 20:31.264
THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THE--

20:31.364 --> 20:33.566
( chuckles )
WITH THE THING.

20:33.666 --> 20:36.603
THE-- IT'S--
IT'S BLOCKED UP.

20:36.703 --> 20:39.238
I JUST CALLED--

20:39.339 --> 20:41.207
I'M GONNA CALL THE HANDYMAN.

20:41.308 --> 20:43.676
OKAY.
WELL THEN, MAY I?

20:43.776 --> 20:45.678
UH, WELL...

20:45.778 --> 20:48.014
WE'RE-- WE'RE ALMOST
OUT OF TIME, SO...

20:48.114 --> 20:50.149
WHAT ARE WE, CAMPING?
I NEED TO PEE.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.084
I MEAN, WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
I'M VERY CLEAN.

20:52.184 --> 20:53.586
I WON'T MESSY
YOUR BATHROOM.

20:53.686 --> 20:55.555
ACTUALLY, I PREFER
MY PATIENTS TO USE THE--

20:55.655 --> 20:58.491
BUT YOU JUST SAID THAT
THE TOILET OVERFLOWED.

21:00.727 --> 21:03.930
WHY DON'T WE JUST
FINISH UP FOR TODAY?

21:04.030 --> 21:08.468
I CAN OWE YOU THE 10 MINUTES
WHEN YOU COME BACK NEXT WEEK.

21:11.771 --> 21:15.442
WHAT, YOU'RE AFRAID
YOUR WIFE WILL SEE ME?

21:20.279 --> 21:22.449
OR THAT I'LL SEE HER?

21:22.549 --> 21:24.717
IS SHE EVEN HOME NOW?
I MEAN, WHAT IS SHE,

21:24.817 --> 21:27.720
SITTING ON THE COUCH
WITH ROLLERS IN HER HAIR
DRINKING BEER?

21:27.820 --> 21:29.956
LAURA, THIS HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH MY WIFE.

21:30.056 --> 21:34.494
OKAY FINE, FORGET IT,
IF IT FREAKS YOU OUT THAT MUCH.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.331
( sighs )

21:38.431 --> 21:39.932
WELL...

21:40.032 --> 21:43.069
I BET THAT DIDN'T COME UP
IN MED SCHOOL, DID IT?

21:43.169 --> 21:44.837
HMM?

21:44.937 --> 21:47.006
"WHAT TO DO IN
THE FOLLOWING SITUATION--

21:47.106 --> 21:51.043
A PATIENT IN LOVE
WITH THE THERAPIST ASKS
TO USE THE BATHROOM.

21:51.143 --> 21:52.912
THE BATHROOM IS
OUT OF ORDER.

21:53.012 --> 21:57.016
THE PATIENT
THEN ASKS TO ENTER
THE THERAPIST'S HOME.

21:57.116 --> 21:59.652
WHAT SHOULD
THE THERAPIST DO?"

21:59.752 --> 22:01.721
- LAURA, I'M SORRY IF--
- THE CORRECT ANSWER IS

22:01.821 --> 22:05.625
IT DEPENDS ON
WHAT THE THERAPIST FEELS
TOWARDS HIS PATIENT.

22:05.725 --> 22:07.627
LAURA, I CAN SEE THAT YOU
MIGHT INTERPRET THIS AS--

22:07.727 --> 22:10.530
DON'T INTERPRET, PAUL.
I'VE HAD IT UP TO HERE

22:10.630 --> 22:13.500
WITH YOUR FUCKING
INTERPRETATIONS.

22:16.068 --> 22:18.638
YOU KNOW WHAT KILLS ME?

22:18.738 --> 22:22.008
THAT NO MATTER WHAT
I SAY OR DO, YOU SEE
EVERYTHING AS MORE PROOF

22:22.108 --> 22:23.810
THAT NOTHING
IS GOING ON HERE.

22:23.910 --> 22:27.246
YOU TURN ME INTO A 15-YEAR-OLD
WHO ISN'T TAKEN SERIOUSLY,

22:27.346 --> 22:28.981
A SILLY LITTLE GIRL

22:29.081 --> 22:31.384
WHO PEOPLE JUST PAT ON THE HEAD
AND SAY, "ISN'T SHE CUTE?"

22:31.484 --> 22:35.488
- YOU KNOW, THE--
- STOP PATRONIZING ME, PAUL.

22:51.471 --> 22:54.140
LOOK, I KNOW WHEN
I TURN SOMEBODY ON.

22:54.240 --> 22:56.375
OKAY?

22:58.110 --> 23:00.547
YOU KNOW WHAT I THOUGHT OF YOU
THE FIRST TIME I SAW YOU?

23:00.647 --> 23:03.683
- WHAT?
- I THOUGHT YOU LOOKED
LIKE A DEAD MAN.

23:03.783 --> 23:08.087
I THOUGHT, BENEATH
THAT PROFESSIONAL EXTERIOR

23:08.187 --> 23:10.757
IS A MAN
WHO STOPPED LIVING.

23:10.857 --> 23:13.426
I WANTED TO TAKE
YOUR HEART IN MY HANDS

23:13.526 --> 23:17.530
AND JUST PUMP LIFE
INTO IT.

23:22.569 --> 23:26.238
MAYBE THAT'S
YOUR SENSE OF--

23:26.338 --> 23:28.407
OF WHAT HAPPENS
TO MARRIED PEOPLE,

23:28.508 --> 23:31.778
THAT THEY JUST
STOP LIVING.

23:31.878 --> 23:36.749
MAYBE YOU'RE AFRAID
THAT'S WHAT'LL HAPPEN
IF YOU MARRY ANDREW.

23:36.849 --> 23:39.819
JUST MY BEING HERE HAS
BROUGHT YOU BACK TO LIFE.

23:44.256 --> 23:46.493
- LAURA, LET'S--
- YEAH.

23:46.593 --> 23:49.128
I KNEW YOU'D DENY IT.

23:49.228 --> 23:51.731
I MEAN, HOW COULD SOMETHING
LIKE THIS HAPPEN TO YOU, HMM?

23:51.831 --> 23:54.867
BUT IT DID HAPPEN.
I KNOW IT HAPPENED
AND YOU KNOW IT HAPPENED.

23:54.967 --> 23:57.069
- WHAT HAPPENED, LAURA?
- ME AND YOU, PAUL.

23:57.169 --> 23:58.705
WE HAPPENED.

23:58.805 --> 24:00.640
AND ALL THE THOUGHTS
THAT YOU HAVE

24:00.740 --> 24:03.442
BEFORE YOU FALL ASLEEP
NEXT TO YOUR WIFE HAPPENED.

24:04.944 --> 24:08.815
AHEM. I THINK WE'RE OUT
OF TIME FOR TODAY, LAURA.

24:08.915 --> 24:11.217
WHY DON'T WE TALK
ABOUT THIS NEXT WEEK

24:11.317 --> 24:14.487
WHEN YOU--
WHEN YOU COME BACK?

24:35.007 --> 24:36.809
JUST TELL ME.

24:36.909 --> 24:39.879
I-- I THINK
YOU OWE IT TO ME.

24:42.549 --> 24:44.851
DO YOU WANT ME?

24:49.088 --> 24:50.489
- I--
- JUST--

24:50.590 --> 24:54.594
JUST A SIMPLE
YES OR NO.

24:57.997 --> 24:59.932
NO.

25:05.838 --> 25:09.275
( gate opens, closes )

25:14.180 --> 25:16.649
( theme music playing )
