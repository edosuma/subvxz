WEBVTT

00:06.020 --> 00:08.635
Oh, I wonder what that's about.

00:08.757 --> 00:10.561
I'm not here.

00:11.331 --> 00:12.608
Wait...

00:12.932 --> 00:15.324
The police are looking for you?

00:18.648 --> 00:20.087
What police?

00:22.025 --> 00:24.566
Hey, guys, guess what.
It's our birthday in two weeks.

00:24.601 --> 00:25.667
You're kidding.

00:25.702 --> 00:29.720
- You all have birthdays on the same day?
- No, no, no, but we decided that,

00:29.755 --> 00:32.240
seeing that birthdays are
so generally unpleasant...

00:32.274 --> 00:33.708
Depressing, scary...

00:33.742 --> 00:36.080
Drunken, hazy...

00:36.114 --> 00:40.138
We decided that we'd just celebrate
ours all together on a neutral day.

00:40.173 --> 00:42.576
And that way we don't
have to acknowledge

00:42.610 --> 00:44.763
the day that we
actually get older.

00:44.797 --> 00:48.933
It works great. I really
don't know how old I am.

00:48.967 --> 00:50.617
So what do you guys
want for your birthday?

00:50.651 --> 00:52.433
A wonderful man
who worships me.

00:52.467 --> 00:55.282
- Two of those.
- Oh, that sounds nice.

00:55.316 --> 00:58.102
Why don't you all get each
other dates for your birthday?

00:58.137 --> 01:00.420
Now, that is an
intriguing idea.

01:00.454 --> 01:02.869
I mean, we're terrible at
picking men for ourselves.

01:02.904 --> 01:05.224
I have five divorces
to prove it.

01:05.259 --> 01:06.857
I wish I had a divorce.

01:06.892 --> 01:08.592
I have animals that die.

01:10.766 --> 01:11.610
Let's do it.

01:11.642 --> 01:14.768
Everyone's gonna pick a name,
and then get a date for that person.

01:14.802 --> 01:17.539
It'll be our new Cleveland
birthday celebration.

01:17.574 --> 01:19.474
And where are we going
to find these men?

01:19.508 --> 01:21.580
They do seem to be
all over this town.

01:21.614 --> 01:25.784
I get disgusting comments and lewd
gestures, like, ten times a day.

01:25.804 --> 01:27.345
It is fantastic!

01:29.419 --> 01:31.334
Elka, are you in?

01:31.369 --> 01:32.384
Sure.

01:33.133 --> 01:35.060
But if you're picking for me,

01:35.095 --> 01:36.600
I don't do fatties.

01:41.387 --> 01:43.927
Okay, Elka, you go first.

01:46.981 --> 01:47.931
Victoria.

01:47.974 --> 01:50.015
- Melanie.
- Elka.

01:50.049 --> 01:51.890
Oh, great that means
Victoria got me.

01:51.925 --> 01:52.591
So?

01:52.626 --> 01:54.398
So you're terrible
at picking gifts.

01:54.432 --> 01:56.798
- I'm gonna get screwed.
- Oh, stop it!

01:56.833 --> 01:58.898
I'm a wonderful gift giver.

01:58.932 --> 02:02.732
See, look at this beautiful
pre-birthday gift I just gave myself.

02:02.888 --> 02:05.300
Wow, Cartier. My favorite.

02:05.382 --> 02:07.748
But you didn't even remember
it was <i>our</i> birthday.

02:07.783 --> 02:09.620
Still, it's a great gift.

02:11.000 --> 02:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:22.862 --> 02:24.965
I wonder when our
presents will arrive.

02:24.999 --> 02:26.302
Yours will be here soon.

02:26.337 --> 02:28.307
I wish the same could
be said for mine.

02:28.341 --> 02:30.511
I'm sure Victoria
didn't find me anyone.

02:30.545 --> 02:33.580
Oh, don't be so negative.
I got Elka a great date.

02:33.615 --> 02:35.255
I'm a little nervous.

02:36.149 --> 02:40.299
Or maybe it's just staring at that
rat's nest that Joy calls a hairdo.

02:42.003 --> 02:44.174
It's so unsettling.

02:44.951 --> 02:48.047
Your nerves are making
you unpleasant.

02:48.082 --> 02:51.053
Yes, but I can fix that
by finishing this wine.

02:51.088 --> 02:53.726
You're still stuck
with that hair.

02:54.627 --> 02:57.633
That's not your joke, Elka.
That's Winston Churchill's.

02:57.668 --> 03:00.572
It's not stealing
if you were there.

03:04.061 --> 03:05.711
Elka, your date's here.

03:08.127 --> 03:09.890
He's handsome!

03:09.925 --> 03:12.130
- Where did you find him?
- At a senior center.

03:12.164 --> 03:14.668
I emailed your photo over to see
if anybody would be interested.

03:14.702 --> 03:17.540
He was the only one who
knew how to email back.

03:17.574 --> 03:19.097
Hey, Max.

03:19.845 --> 03:23.652
Melanie, so nice to
officially meet you.

03:23.687 --> 03:25.556
And you must be Elka.

03:25.590 --> 03:26.693
I am.

03:26.774 --> 03:30.656
May I say that you're even
lovelier than in your picture?

03:31.264 --> 03:33.041
Yes, you may.

03:33.365 --> 03:34.966
Shall we?

03:35.007 --> 03:36.472
To be fair,

03:36.507 --> 03:39.941
in my computer, your picture
is displayed in 200%.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.928
I've seen all of you, but

03:41.963 --> 03:43.686
not all at once.

04:00.604 --> 04:03.381
- Uh, excuse me.
- Yeah.

04:03.415 --> 04:05.851
- I'm Victoria Chase.
- Hi.

04:05.885 --> 04:08.655
How would you like to pretend
to be my friend's date?

04:08.689 --> 04:10.759
Uh, what's the matter with her?

04:10.793 --> 04:12.628
Nothing, really.
She's quite attractive.

04:12.663 --> 04:15.467
She's sitting right over there
with the long brown hair.

04:15.501 --> 04:17.170
- Oh...
- I'll give you 200 bucks.

04:17.204 --> 04:19.339
- Great!
- Wait, wait, wait.

04:19.374 --> 04:21.142
But you can't be yourself.

04:21.177 --> 04:22.511
I mean, I'm sure you're great,

04:22.545 --> 04:25.648
but I was supposed to find
her a specific type of guy.

04:25.682 --> 04:27.550
Well, why didn't you if you
said you were going to?

04:27.584 --> 04:30.820
Well, I ran out of time,
or I didn't prioritize, or...

04:30.854 --> 04:33.354
I don't know,
I just-- get off my back!

04:34.891 --> 04:36.124
What do you do?

04:36.158 --> 04:38.292
Well, with the economy
and everything--

04:38.326 --> 04:40.694
okay, I'm bored already.

04:40.728 --> 04:43.329
You are an architect.
She goes crazy for them.

04:43.364 --> 04:45.114
Okay...

04:45.199 --> 04:47.166
And you have three dogs,
but not purebreds.

04:47.200 --> 04:50.435
She'd never go for that.
Let's see, what else?

04:50.470 --> 04:53.071
Oh, compliment her earlobes.
Don't ask me why.

04:53.105 --> 04:54.939
Favorite color, celadon.

04:54.974 --> 04:57.575
Don't order beets,
and do not mention Helen Mirren.

04:57.609 --> 05:00.173
- What's your name?
- Uh, Steve.

05:00.213 --> 05:04.145
No, no, I think that
you are an Alistair.

05:04.179 --> 05:07.506
- Then I think I need another 50.
- Okay, Steve's good.

05:08.516 --> 05:10.083
Well, I'll be damned.

05:10.117 --> 05:11.851
These are my friends
Melanie and Joy.

05:11.885 --> 05:13.986
- Hi.
- And this is Steve.

05:14.020 --> 05:15.591
He's an architect.

05:16.791 --> 05:17.853
I am.

05:19.395 --> 05:20.695
And I like dogs.

05:22.059 --> 05:23.259
I love dogs.

05:24.593 --> 05:25.700
You have dogs?

05:25.734 --> 05:28.302
Yes, yes. Uh, mutts.

05:28.336 --> 05:30.203
I mean I love all dogs,

05:30.238 --> 05:33.339
but I just don't see the
point of buying a dog

05:33.373 --> 05:36.641
from an industry that promotes
inbreeding and puppyvilles

05:36.676 --> 05:39.606
when there are so many mixed breeds
out there in need of a home.

05:39.641 --> 05:41.945
I feel exactly the same way.

05:41.979 --> 05:43.913
Well, should I try to
go round us up a table?

05:43.947 --> 05:45.814
- Sounds great.
- All right.

05:45.848 --> 05:47.098
So...

05:47.516 --> 05:50.206
I owe you an apology.

05:50.246 --> 05:52.451
You truly are a
wonderful friend

05:52.485 --> 05:54.953
who seems to have
found me a great guy.

05:54.988 --> 05:57.258
I'm sorry. I really
underestimated you.

05:57.293 --> 06:00.662
Oh, well,
I accept your apology.

06:00.696 --> 06:02.696
You are free to enjoy him now.

06:04.835 --> 06:08.485
I can't believe you went to that
much work to find Joy's date.

06:08.642 --> 06:10.872
But you <i>do</i> believe it, right?

06:13.309 --> 06:15.910
Oh, Happy Birthday.

06:15.944 --> 06:17.611
Do you think he's
here for one of us?

06:17.646 --> 06:19.379
Oh, he's looking over here.
How do I look?

06:19.414 --> 06:20.905
Freakishly young.

06:20.940 --> 06:23.911
- What about me? How's my hair?
- Like God re-touched it.

06:23.946 --> 06:25.344
- Good luck.
- You too.

06:25.345 --> 06:28.345
- Uh, Victoria?
- Yes!

06:29.155 --> 06:31.557
Sorry I'm late. I had to jog
the last couple of blocks

06:31.591 --> 06:34.926
just to get here,
but it was worth it--wow.

06:34.960 --> 06:37.796
Are all actresses as
beautiful in person as you?

06:37.831 --> 06:38.831
Sadly, no.

06:41.832 --> 06:44.466
Glenn Miller or Tommy Dorsey?

06:44.500 --> 06:46.702
Oh, Miller all the way.

06:46.736 --> 06:48.237
Yeah, that was real music.

06:48.271 --> 06:51.171
I don't go for that stuff
that's out there now.

06:51.239 --> 06:52.439
Michael Buble.

06:54.477 --> 06:56.577
Have you heard this yahoo?

06:57.211 --> 06:59.513
Please! You mean
wannabe Sinatra.

06:59.547 --> 07:00.914
Exactly.

07:00.948 --> 07:04.617
Go back to the second floor
at Nordstrom's, I say.

07:05.460 --> 07:07.485
Okay, another question:

07:07.923 --> 07:09.423
Favorite medication.

07:12.158 --> 07:13.908
Oh, that's a tough one.

07:15.271 --> 07:18.676
All things considered,
I think I'm gonna have to say

07:18.818 --> 07:19.818
Celebrex.

07:20.527 --> 07:22.360
Celebrex. Nice.

07:22.648 --> 07:25.863
I'm an allopurinol man myself.

07:25.898 --> 07:27.330
Ooh, gout!

07:28.169 --> 07:29.869
Somebody likes to party.

07:32.641 --> 07:35.291
Ever go to Canada for
your discount rates?

07:36.879 --> 07:41.148
Do I? I'm on a first-name basis
with all the border guards.

07:41.857 --> 07:43.201
Me too.

07:43.236 --> 07:45.136
We should carpool next time.

07:47.071 --> 07:50.155
Is it possible that you
are the perfect woman?

07:50.885 --> 07:53.824
Well, I'd say it's
very possible.

07:55.644 --> 07:57.861
Will you be eating alone?
I can bring over a place setting.

07:57.896 --> 08:00.129
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I--I have a date.

08:00.163 --> 08:01.629
It's a blind date.
He should be here soon.

08:01.663 --> 08:03.462
I'm sure he will.
Anything else?

08:03.496 --> 08:05.163
I'm really nervous.

08:05.198 --> 08:07.332
I haven't been on a blind date in,
like, oh, gosh, forever.

08:07.366 --> 08:08.633
I just got divorced.

08:08.667 --> 08:10.534
I'm totally over it.
It's just, you know,

08:10.568 --> 08:12.869
sometimes it still feels
a little fresh and raw.

08:12.904 --> 08:14.280
But this is just the
type of adventure

08:14.315 --> 08:16.621
I signed up for when I moved
to Cleveland, isn't it?

08:16.656 --> 08:20.141
Uh, I was just wondering if
you need a fork or something.

08:22.499 --> 08:23.399
Melanie?

08:23.639 --> 08:24.379
Yes?

08:26.884 --> 08:28.684
I think I'm gonna be sick.

08:32.154 --> 08:34.563
I'm so sorry.
That didn't come out right.

08:34.597 --> 08:36.998
It's just your face
is kind of--oh...

08:40.124 --> 08:42.181
Sorry, I'm feeling
queasy again.

08:42.216 --> 08:44.648
Why don't we just leave
it at I'm not your type?

08:44.668 --> 08:47.310
No, no, no, actually,
you're totally my type.

08:47.330 --> 08:49.630
You look exactly
like my dead wife.

08:51.189 --> 08:53.566
- Uh...Thank you?
- Yeah.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.593
Listen, this is obviously
upsetting for you,

08:55.627 --> 08:57.494
so let's just not do
the whole date thing.

08:57.529 --> 09:00.463
Oh, listen, I really need
to move on with my life,

09:00.497 --> 09:03.265
and this is the first actual
date I've had since the funeral.

09:03.299 --> 09:06.334
And Joy said so many nice things
about you in line at the deli.

09:06.368 --> 09:08.979
You know what, I don't know
if this is a real good idea.

09:08.999 --> 09:09.999
Please?

09:10.387 --> 09:14.506
If I have to spend another night alone,
I don't know what I'll do.

09:17.123 --> 09:18.409
Why not?

09:18.866 --> 09:20.911
Life's too short, right?

09:21.247 --> 09:22.497
I'm so sorry.

09:26.470 --> 09:27.457
So where were we?

09:27.492 --> 09:30.338
You were telling me how you all
picked dates for each other.

09:30.373 --> 09:32.552
- That's fun.
- Oh, it is fun.

09:33.013 --> 09:35.114
Especially when it looks
like I got the prize.

09:35.148 --> 09:37.082
Oh, I'm flattered.

09:37.116 --> 09:38.483
You'll have to excuse me,
I'm still sweating.

09:38.517 --> 09:41.051
That run over here was a bit
further than I anticipated.

09:41.085 --> 09:42.252
Oh. Do you mind?

09:42.286 --> 09:43.519
No, not at all.

09:43.554 --> 09:46.454
You just take off as much
clothing as you like.

09:57.316 --> 10:00.267
You know, I never formally
introduced myself.

10:00.301 --> 10:01.401
I'm Chester.

10:05.138 --> 10:06.539
Chester.

10:06.573 --> 10:08.823
Well, that'll be
easy to remember.

10:11.076 --> 10:13.226
The truth is I'm
a great driver,

10:13.755 --> 10:17.212
but sometimes I like
to drive real slow

10:17.246 --> 10:18.996
just to mess with people.

10:21.538 --> 10:24.417
I am having such a good time.

10:24.452 --> 10:26.052
Me too.

10:26.469 --> 10:29.122
I think we should get married.

10:29.156 --> 10:32.357
Me too. Pass the salt.

10:32.391 --> 10:35.060
Really? You'd marry me?

10:35.094 --> 10:36.896
Yeah, I would.

10:37.133 --> 10:41.067
I mean once around we're
perfect for each other.

10:41.101 --> 10:43.335
I'm glad to hear that.

10:43.370 --> 10:46.304
Oh, here's your salt.

10:46.339 --> 10:48.940
I'm impressed you
can still use that.

10:48.975 --> 10:51.977
Oh, I know how to
shake what I've got.

10:57.246 --> 11:00.115
I've been wanting to
do that all night.

11:00.150 --> 11:02.417
Oh...Well...

11:02.451 --> 11:06.821
Now I can get back
to my rigatoni.

11:06.887 --> 11:07.932
Celadon?

11:08.170 --> 11:10.271
Most men don't even
know what that is.

11:10.305 --> 11:13.205
Well...I do.

11:13.674 --> 11:16.475
So becoming an architect
was like a calling?

11:16.509 --> 11:19.944
Yes. Yes, it was like someone
tapped me on the shoulder

11:19.978 --> 11:22.128
and said,
"you're an architect."

11:24.314 --> 11:27.182
And I'll start with
the Caesar salad.

11:27.217 --> 11:29.785
Hey, have you ever thought
about wearing your hair,

11:29.819 --> 11:32.188
I don't know,
back a little bit?

11:33.448 --> 11:37.057
- Excuse me?
- Just push it back on the sides.

11:37.092 --> 11:39.659
That--that's too much.
A little less.

11:39.694 --> 11:42.262
Oh, God, it's uncanny!

11:42.296 --> 11:45.696
This is gonna sound crazy,
but you look so much like her.

11:46.046 --> 11:47.896
I gotta show you a picture.

11:49.330 --> 11:50.834
How's your pasta?

11:50.868 --> 11:52.568
Fine. How's your breast?

11:56.179 --> 11:57.440
It's a meatloaf.

11:57.474 --> 11:58.724
I'll say it is.

12:01.365 --> 12:02.279
Victoria.

12:02.314 --> 12:03.647
Excuse me, my friend--

12:03.681 --> 12:05.181
needs me at the bar.

12:08.386 --> 12:11.721
You're not gonna believe this, but my date
is trying to turn me into his dead wife.

12:11.756 --> 12:13.096
Okay, that's nothing.

12:13.131 --> 12:15.260
You seen the cans on Chester?

12:23.726 --> 12:27.567
And his name is "chester"?

12:27.602 --> 12:30.837
Would you ask our waitress to bring
us a bottle of champagne, please?

12:30.871 --> 12:34.139
Champagne!
You really came through.

12:34.173 --> 12:36.473
- You're a good friend.
- Aren't I?

12:36.508 --> 12:39.210
Oh, hey, hey, Victoria,
thanks again.

12:39.245 --> 12:41.395
Best blind date
I have ever had.

12:47.685 --> 12:51.253
I am not gonna let
this one get away.

12:54.557 --> 12:56.557
Oh, boy.

12:59.369 --> 13:01.941
You set Joy up with a murderer?

13:02.002 --> 13:05.690
Well, to be fair, at the time I just
thought he was a complete stranger.

13:05.725 --> 13:08.336
Now, can we just focus and figure
out what we should do next?

13:08.363 --> 13:10.330
There's a tip line
number on the screen.

13:10.364 --> 13:12.766
It's ringing. Oh, my God,
how did this happen?

13:12.800 --> 13:15.568
Well, I kinda sorta picked him
when I came in here tonight.

13:15.602 --> 13:19.338
I gave him 200 bucks and told
him to show her a good time.

13:19.372 --> 13:23.007
So he's a murderer
<i>and</i> a hooker!

13:23.042 --> 13:25.510
Oh, hello, hello!
Yes, this is Melanie Moretti.

13:25.544 --> 13:27.644
The suspect that
you're looking for

13:27.679 --> 13:29.413
is at Stormy's on Euclid.

13:29.447 --> 13:32.295
And the only thing I
hate more than beets

13:32.336 --> 13:33.636
is Helen Mirren.

13:35.451 --> 13:37.451
Kiss me.

13:38.120 --> 13:40.254
Hurry! Hurry!
He's kissing her!

13:41.012 --> 13:42.222
Okay, thank you.

13:42.257 --> 13:44.758
Okay, he said to stay
calm and act normal.

13:44.792 --> 13:47.202
And we have to try and keep
him here until they arrive.

13:47.215 --> 13:49.796
Okay, well, let's just get rid of
our dates so that we can focus.

13:49.830 --> 13:53.930
Oh, gosh, you know, considering
everything, maybe my date's not so bad.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.219
Oh, who am I kidding?

14:00.202 --> 14:02.540
- Everything okay?
- Wow...

14:02.575 --> 14:04.875
That jacket really
does wonders for you.

14:04.910 --> 14:06.610
Yeah, I got it
right off the rack.

14:06.644 --> 14:10.144
Don't say rack.

14:10.614 --> 14:12.048
Listen, Chester,

14:12.082 --> 14:14.150
I don't think it's gonna
work out between us.

14:14.184 --> 14:16.685
But we didn't even
finish dinner yet.

14:16.719 --> 14:17.986
Sorry for whatever
it is I did wrong.

14:18.020 --> 14:20.455
Wait, wait. Come here.

14:20.489 --> 14:25.625
Um, excuse me, do you
find this man attractive?

14:25.660 --> 14:26.793
And she's cute, right?

14:26.827 --> 14:28.128
- Yeah.
- Good. Great.

14:28.162 --> 14:29.595
Why don't you sit down
and buy her a drink.

14:29.630 --> 14:30.796
- Really?
- Really.

14:30.831 --> 14:32.631
- Well, okay.
- No, no, no.

14:32.665 --> 14:36.667
Keep that on...Forever.

14:36.701 --> 14:38.951
Let's go.

14:39.171 --> 14:40.371
I suppose you're right.

14:40.406 --> 14:42.473
I guess I wasn't really ready
to get out there after all.

14:42.507 --> 14:44.774
You know what, it's okay. It's okay.
It was very nice to meet you,

14:44.808 --> 14:45.775
and I wish you
nothing but the best.

14:45.809 --> 14:47.643
You know, I think why

14:47.677 --> 14:49.311
my wife's death
is so hard on me

14:49.345 --> 14:51.513
is that I never got a
chance to say good-bye.

14:51.547 --> 14:53.815
I got to the hospital
ten minutes too late.

14:53.850 --> 14:55.984
Oh, you poor thing.

14:56.018 --> 14:58.486
I know this is gonna sound odd,

14:58.520 --> 15:00.621
but with you being
so much like her,

15:00.655 --> 15:02.356
I feel like it would
help give me closure

15:02.390 --> 15:04.458
if I could say good-bye
to you in the way

15:04.492 --> 15:06.026
that I wanted to say
good-bye to her.

15:06.060 --> 15:09.328
Oh, you know,
that's-- I don't know.

15:09.363 --> 15:11.296
- Yeah, it's too much.
- Yeah.

15:11.331 --> 15:15.200
- I get it. I'll go.
- Okay. Okay.

15:15.234 --> 15:17.936
Oh, go ahead, say good-bye.

15:17.970 --> 15:20.471
Oh, thank you.

15:23.574 --> 15:26.842
Honey, you're the most
amazing woman I've ever met.

15:28.197 --> 15:31.597
Your strength, grace,
and courage will be with me always.

15:31.700 --> 15:32.750
I love you.

15:33.251 --> 15:34.301
Okey-dokey!

15:37.321 --> 15:39.887
May I give her a little kiss?

15:39.922 --> 15:43.290
It's me, not her.
But whatever.

15:46.445 --> 15:50.403
I'd give anything to make
love to her one last time.

15:51.700 --> 15:53.730
And we're done here.

15:55.833 --> 15:57.567
Guess what happened to me!

15:57.602 --> 15:59.485
Elka, not now. We're in
the middle of a crisis.

15:59.506 --> 16:00.870
I got engaged.

16:05.241 --> 16:07.375
- I knew you'd like him!
- He's amazing.

16:07.410 --> 16:10.110
Oh, no, he's paying the bill!
He's gonna go. We have to keep him here.

16:10.145 --> 16:11.111
Oh, my God,
what are we gonna do?

16:11.145 --> 16:15.048
Who cares about Joy? What about me?
I'm getting married.

16:15.082 --> 16:18.083
I'm, like, 100!

16:18.118 --> 16:23.554
Listen, Victoria accidentally
set Joy up with a murderer.

16:25.590 --> 16:28.592
I'm conflicted.

16:31.593 --> 16:33.563
I am on a great date
for once in my life,

16:33.598 --> 16:34.898
and you guys are
acting like idiots.

16:34.932 --> 16:36.232
What's going on?

16:36.873 --> 16:40.402
Uh, well, I waited
until the last minute,

16:40.437 --> 16:43.205
and I just grabbed the first
guy I could find a the bar,

16:43.239 --> 16:45.607
and I gave him $200
to be your date.

16:45.641 --> 16:49.243
What? You paid Steve
to go out with me?

16:49.278 --> 16:51.678
This is all fake?

16:51.713 --> 16:54.488
Oh, my God, this is, like,
the worst thing you've ever done to me.

16:54.523 --> 16:56.104
Well, there's more.

16:58.617 --> 17:02.388
- Uh, he's kind of a...Murderer.
- What?

17:02.423 --> 17:05.290
But the police
are on their way.

17:05.326 --> 17:06.560
Guys, he's coming.

17:06.594 --> 17:08.228
Okay, listen, we have to
try and keep him here,

17:08.262 --> 17:09.296
so just act natural.

17:09.329 --> 17:11.431
How do I act natural
with a murderer?

17:11.464 --> 17:13.598
Just do the opposite of that.

17:14.983 --> 17:16.902
So, Joy, are you ready to go?

17:16.935 --> 17:20.304
My van's parked out front.

17:20.969 --> 17:22.104
Your van?

17:22.144 --> 17:24.673
He has a <i>van!</i>

17:24.707 --> 17:25.740
Are you okay?

17:25.773 --> 17:27.742
- Why don't you join us for dessert?
- Yes.

17:27.776 --> 17:30.044
You know, to be honest,
I was just...

17:30.078 --> 17:31.211
Hoping to get Joy alone.

17:31.246 --> 17:33.714
No! I mean-- tell
me what I mean!

17:33.748 --> 17:36.449
- She has a rare disease.
- Joy's a lesbian.

17:36.484 --> 17:37.484
Hey.

17:38.485 --> 17:39.485
Oh, God!

17:43.956 --> 17:46.367
Now can we talk
about my engagement?

17:54.626 --> 17:56.827
As soon as he was on the
floor writhing in pain,

17:56.861 --> 17:58.195
I could see that

17:58.229 --> 18:01.465
the sketch really didn't
look that much like him.

18:01.499 --> 18:03.835
Then why did you kick him?

18:03.869 --> 18:07.472
The police did say that these
mistakes happen all the time.

18:07.506 --> 18:10.074
Joy, I am so sorry
about everything.

18:10.108 --> 18:12.843
You should be.
I knew this would happen.

18:13.714 --> 18:16.664
Listen, of all the things
that happened tonight,

18:16.931 --> 18:18.748
the one thing that I
can't get out of my mind

18:18.782 --> 18:20.616
is the look on your
face when you thought

18:20.650 --> 18:23.452
I had finally done this
great thing for you.

18:23.486 --> 18:25.936
And then all I did
was disappoint you.

18:27.323 --> 18:30.124
I wasn't a good friend, and I will
never forgive myself for that.

18:30.158 --> 18:35.295
Of course you will.
And I will too.

18:35.329 --> 18:37.363
I thought Steve was
the perfect guy

18:37.398 --> 18:40.733
because everything he said were
things you knew I would love.

18:40.767 --> 18:43.593
Things only a best
friend would know.

18:43.695 --> 18:46.738
You know me well.

18:47.688 --> 18:48.688
Still, I--

18:51.749 --> 18:53.749
I would like you to have this.

18:56.745 --> 18:59.215
You know me <i>very</i> well!

19:00.737 --> 19:03.685
At least Joy's date
didn't have a dead wife.

19:03.720 --> 19:04.720
Or boobs.

19:06.856 --> 19:09.090
My date had both.

19:09.950 --> 19:12.925
So, Elka, when are you
gonna make it official?

19:12.960 --> 19:15.828
Oh...That's over.

19:15.862 --> 19:17.596
We started having problems.

19:17.630 --> 19:19.731
- Oh...
- What happened?

19:19.765 --> 19:22.901
Well, we got along fine,

19:22.935 --> 19:27.605
but he wouldn't go downtown,
if you know what I mean.

19:31.578 --> 19:32.828
What?

19:32.977 --> 19:35.577
I mean, there are so
many good restaurants

19:35.612 --> 19:39.014
and shops down there.

19:39.048 --> 19:41.382
I can't give that up.

19:41.417 --> 19:44.251
Of course you do.

19:44.286 --> 19:46.687
What'd you think I
was talking about?

19:46.721 --> 19:49.389
Nothing. Nothing at all.

19:51.625 --> 19:54.393
- Hi.
- Max...

19:54.428 --> 19:57.462
Listen, Elka,
I don't want to lose you.

19:57.497 --> 19:59.297
So if you're still up for it,

19:59.331 --> 20:02.866
I'm willing to try
going downtown.

20:06.170 --> 20:08.605
- You are?
- Yes.

20:08.639 --> 20:11.189
I just hope I won't
get lost down there.

20:14.576 --> 20:16.210
Oh, you won't.

20:16.244 --> 20:20.213
I have no problem
telling you where to go.

20:20.247 --> 20:25.317
It's just that it's so
dark and scary there.

20:25.351 --> 20:27.651
- Happy Birthday.
- Happy Birthday!
