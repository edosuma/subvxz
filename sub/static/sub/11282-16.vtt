CHRIS ROCK:
When I was growing up,
I loved boxing

00:04.272 --> 00:06.374
because I loved
the movie Rocky.

00:06.407 --> 00:10.078
I'd seen it a million times
and could recite every line.

00:10.111 --> 00:11.545
The lines everyone knew...

00:11.579 --> 00:13.481
Yo, Adrian!

00:13.514 --> 00:14.748
And lines everyone
didn't know...

00:14.782 --> 00:17.318
:
Why do you have to wear
that stinkin' sweatsuit?

00:17.351 --> 00:19.420
:
It brings me luck,
y'know?

00:19.453 --> 00:20.754
Brings you luck?

00:20.788 --> 00:22.290
I'll tell you
what it brings.

00:22.323 --> 00:23.757
It brings flies!

00:23.791 --> 00:27.128
And in the spring of 1987,
boxing was big

00:27.161 --> 00:28.696
and some people
thought Mike Tyson

00:28.729 --> 00:30.531
was the greatest boxer alive.

00:30.564 --> 00:33.067
Dude, Mike Tyson is the
greatest boxer alive.

00:33.101 --> 00:34.435
And some people didn't.

00:34.468 --> 00:35.569
No, he's not.

00:35.603 --> 00:37.338
James "Bonecrusher" Smith is
the first heavyweight champ

00:37.371 --> 00:39.207
with a college degree.
The brother is smart.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.675
Then why'd he go into
the face

00:41.709 --> 00:42.843
You know what?

00:42.876 --> 00:44.312
I'll bet you
five dollars

00:44.345 --> 00:46.080
that he beats Tyson
in Vegas next week.

00:46.114 --> 00:47.381
It's like taking candy
from a baby.

00:47.415 --> 00:48.782
Who would do that?

00:48.816 --> 00:49.917
You know what?
You're on.

00:49.950 --> 00:52.753
There was only one part
of boxing I didn't like...

00:53.754 --> 00:55.789
...getting punched.

00:57.658 --> 00:59.627
I thought white guys
only knocked out

00:59.660 --> 01:01.262
the black guys in the movies.

01:01.295 --> 01:03.364
Only in white movies.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.367
You know, I like
seeing a good fight.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.669
But what I just saw--
that was terrible.

01:08.702 --> 01:09.470
Why didn't you do something?

01:09.503 --> 01:11.372
Why didn't you do anything?

01:11.405 --> 01:12.773
Right. I was too busy

01:12.806 --> 01:14.342
getting punched in the face.

01:14.375 --> 01:15.443
I'll tell you what.

01:15.476 --> 01:17.645
I run a boxing program
down at the Boys Athletic Club.

01:17.678 --> 01:20.114
Why don't you come by,
I'll teach you to box, huh?

01:20.148 --> 01:21.815
You could learn
to defend yourself.

01:21.849 --> 01:22.850
I don't know.

01:22.883 --> 01:24.518
C'mon. You'll be like Rocky.

01:24.552 --> 01:26.287
But instead of being
the Italian Stallion,

01:26.320 --> 01:28.422
you'll be
the Black Stallion.

01:28.456 --> 01:30.691
Hope I don't get sent
to the glue factory.

01:43.304 --> 01:45.406
* Ah, make it funky now.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.926
Thurman was the first teacher
that ever did anything

02:05.959 --> 02:07.928
about me getting beat down
every day,

02:07.961 --> 02:10.231
only I couldn't figure out why.

02:10.264 --> 02:13.267
Wait, what difference does me
getting beat up make to you?

02:13.301 --> 02:16.370
I don't like seeing the
"metaphorical" little guy
get beat up.

02:16.404 --> 02:17.738
The United States
was a little guy

02:17.771 --> 02:19.307
but we're a superpower now

02:19.340 --> 02:22.276
'cause we got out from
under England's thumb.

02:22.310 --> 02:24.312
Thurman cared
about the principles

02:24.345 --> 02:25.779
of boxing for self-defense.

02:25.813 --> 02:28.482
I wanted to box
for another reason.

02:28.516 --> 02:30.551
This is what I imagined
my life would be like

02:30.584 --> 02:31.785
after I learned how to box.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.787
What's the matter, Sir Nose,

02:33.821 --> 02:35.556
can't catch the rhythm
of the stroke?

02:35.589 --> 02:38.526
*

02:39.493 --> 02:41.629
Maybe pigs do fly.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.797
While I was going to learn
to fight,

02:43.831 --> 02:45.833
my father was fighting
the clock.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.703
Hey, baby.
Whoa!

02:49.737 --> 02:51.405
Oh.

02:51.439 --> 02:52.540
What are you doing?

02:52.573 --> 02:54.408
Just waiting for you to wake up.

02:54.442 --> 02:55.876
Why?

02:55.909 --> 02:58.879
Well, you've been working
so many extra shifts lately.

02:58.912 --> 03:00.481
I miss you.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.750
Oh, I miss you too, baby.

03:02.783 --> 03:04.818
Mwah.
Mmm.

03:10.658 --> 03:12.626
Why are you staring
at my feet?

03:12.660 --> 03:14.328
She loves your bunions.

03:14.362 --> 03:16.264
I'm just trying
to be close to you.

03:16.297 --> 03:18.566
I never get a chance
to see you anymore.

03:18.599 --> 03:21.569
I barely even remember
what you look like.

03:21.602 --> 03:24.572
And I get lonely.

03:24.605 --> 03:26.274
I know,

03:26.307 --> 03:27.775
but I have to go to work

03:27.808 --> 03:29.777
so you can either be
lonely in this house

03:29.810 --> 03:31.612
or together in the streets.

03:31.645 --> 03:32.580
That's it?

03:32.613 --> 03:34.348
That's what?

03:36.384 --> 03:38.752
I'm talkin' about you,

03:38.786 --> 03:40.788
and you're talking
about this house.

03:40.821 --> 03:42.690
I can't

03:42.723 --> 03:44.692
watch TV with this house.

03:44.725 --> 03:47.695
I can't talk to this house
about my day.

03:47.728 --> 03:50.398
I can't ask this house
to rub my feet!

03:50.431 --> 03:53.401
When I hear a noise downstairs
in the middle of the night,

03:53.434 --> 03:55.403
I can't ask this house

03:55.436 --> 03:57.438
to go downstairs
and see what it is!

03:59.307 --> 04:02.376
Julius, I did not marry
this house.

04:02.410 --> 04:04.412
I married a man!

04:04.445 --> 04:05.546
But when they leave the man,

04:05.579 --> 04:07.648
they always end up
with a house.

04:07.681 --> 04:09.683
I wasn't saying that.

04:09.717 --> 04:11.685
That's okay.

04:11.719 --> 04:13.687
You just keep on workin',

04:13.721 --> 04:15.856
but I'm not gonna sit here
and wait

04:15.889 --> 04:18.426
to watch you tie your shoes.

04:22.896 --> 04:25.032
My father had
two full-time jobs,

04:25.065 --> 04:26.867
three if you count my mother.
Hey, Dad.

04:28.736 --> 04:30.738
Mom said that since you
like to work so much

04:30.771 --> 04:31.772
to take these letters
around the corner.

04:31.805 --> 04:33.374
They belong to somebody
in the other building.

04:33.407 --> 04:34.675
Okay.

04:34.708 --> 04:35.943
I'll see you after school.

04:35.976 --> 04:37.411
Oh, and I'm gonna be home late
tonight.

04:37.445 --> 04:38.646
Why

04:38.679 --> 04:40.414
I'm learning how to box.

04:40.448 --> 04:41.415
Box?

04:41.449 --> 04:42.416
How much is that gonna cost?

04:42.450 --> 04:43.751
Just a little dignity.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.319
Nothing. My teacher's
supplying everything.

04:45.353 --> 04:46.954
That's great.

04:46.987 --> 04:48.856
Remember what happened
with you and karate.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.023
Don't break no bones.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.525
Bones are expensive.

05:00.368 --> 05:02.370
Yes, can I...

05:02.403 --> 05:03.604
help you?

05:03.637 --> 05:06.039
Are you Ms., uh, Hutchins?

05:06.073 --> 05:07.441
Yes.

05:07.475 --> 05:09.577
Well, I think I got your mail
by mistake.

05:09.610 --> 05:11.545
She'd like to help him
make another mistake.

05:11.579 --> 05:12.913
That is so sweet of you.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.915
I just moved here
about a month ago.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.617
Where

05:16.650 --> 05:17.651
In poverty.

05:17.685 --> 05:19.587
Around the corner.
In the building behind you.

05:19.620 --> 05:22.590
Well, I guess that means
we're neighbors.

05:22.623 --> 05:23.924
I'm Darlene.

05:23.957 --> 05:24.958
And you're...?

05:24.992 --> 05:25.993
Married.

05:26.026 --> 05:27.027
Julius.

05:27.060 --> 05:28.396
Nice to meet you.

05:28.429 --> 05:29.730
Nice to meet you.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.365
Mm-hmm.

05:31.399 --> 05:32.900
While my father
was getting hit on,

05:32.933 --> 05:34.768
I was about to get
my first punch in.

05:34.802 --> 05:37.771
Most guys-- they want
to learn how to box

05:37.805 --> 05:39.540
so they can punch,
understand?

05:39.573 --> 05:40.741
Uppercut, jab, hook.

05:40.774 --> 05:42.710
Right? But punching is
only the second

05:42.743 --> 05:44.745
most important thing
in boxing.

05:44.778 --> 05:46.013
What's the first thing?

05:46.046 --> 05:47.047
Not getting hit.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.716
Muhammad Ali
said it best:

05:48.749 --> 05:51.885
gotta "float like a butterfly,
sting like a bee.

05:51.919 --> 05:55.155
The hands can't hit
what the eyes can't see."

05:55.188 --> 05:55.989
All right, pop.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.425
Ow!

05:57.458 --> 05:58.492
That hurt, right?

05:58.526 --> 06:00.093
Yeah, that's why
I said, "Ow."

06:00.127 --> 06:01.762
Okay, so at that moment,

06:01.795 --> 06:02.763
what would you rather
be doing,

06:02.796 --> 06:04.898
punching or not getting hit?

06:04.932 --> 06:05.933
Not getting hit.

06:05.966 --> 06:07.568
Okay. Good.
Take a swing at me.

06:07.601 --> 06:08.869
Give it everything you got.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.171
That's good.
Okay, now, keep it coming.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.105
Keep 'em coming.

06:13.006 --> 06:13.807
Whoa!

06:13.841 --> 06:14.675
Nice!

06:14.708 --> 06:16.644
See, the best offense

06:16.677 --> 06:17.645
is a strong defense.

06:17.678 --> 06:18.812
Okay?

06:18.846 --> 06:19.780
Because defense

06:19.813 --> 06:22.416
is the art of preparing
for any eventuality.

06:22.450 --> 06:24.852
Because when
you get hit,

06:24.885 --> 06:26.820
eventually,
you're going down.

06:26.854 --> 06:28.055
Right?

06:28.088 --> 06:29.423
But when they show up,

06:29.457 --> 06:31.592
what do they do
if you're not there?

06:31.625 --> 06:33.994
We could ask Osama Bin Laden.

06:35.696 --> 06:38.832
While I was taking
my first boxing lesson,

06:38.866 --> 06:41.835
Drew was about to learn
something new.

06:41.869 --> 06:43.804
Hey, Dad, I need
some help.

06:43.837 --> 06:46.073
My window is stuck,
and it's kind of stuffy in here.

06:46.106 --> 06:48.742
By stuffy he means funky.

06:48.776 --> 06:50.811
Let me take a look at it.

06:56.550 --> 06:59.553
Now, that's a nice welcome
to the neighborhood.

07:00.654 --> 07:03.524
Since you had a little something
for me...

07:03.557 --> 07:05.693
I got a little something
for you.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.164
There you go.

07:11.198 --> 07:13.200
Thanks, Dad.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.604
Drew wanted more fresh air,

07:16.637 --> 07:18.639
but he got something
even better.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.845
Instead of taking
her clothes off,

07:24.878 --> 07:26.480
she should have kept
her glasses on.

07:35.656 --> 07:37.024
Relax, we know

07:37.057 --> 07:38.926
this is a kids' show.
Cool.

07:47.768 --> 07:50.771
Earlier that day my mother had
made my father's sandwich

07:50.804 --> 07:53.106
with a little extra love.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.108
"Thinking of you.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.977
Love, Rochelle."

08:07.821 --> 08:10.791
Secretly, he was happy
'cause he got his dime back.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.292
Back at school,

08:12.325 --> 08:14.828
there was only one person
more excited about me boxing

08:14.862 --> 08:15.829
than me.

08:15.863 --> 08:17.731
Dude, you're learning
the way of the pugilist.

08:17.765 --> 08:19.533
The sweet science
of fisticuffs.

08:19.567 --> 08:21.168
I'm just learning
the basics.
Yeah, if that's
the case,

08:21.201 --> 08:22.302
maybe you can understand

08:22.335 --> 08:23.871
why Tyson's gonna dismantle
Bonecrusher.

08:23.904 --> 08:24.872
Oh, you wish.

08:24.905 --> 08:26.540
I heard they're having a
closed-circuit screening

08:26.574 --> 08:27.875
at Madison Square Garden,

08:27.908 --> 08:29.577
but it's been
sold out for months.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.845
Dude, I'd do anything
to see that fight.

08:31.879 --> 08:33.981
Would you fight Mike Tyson?

08:37.184 --> 08:38.919
Whoa, that's good.

08:40.588 --> 08:42.590
That's good!
Maybe it's time

08:42.623 --> 08:44.324
we try you in the ring
with some real boxers.

08:44.357 --> 08:45.125
Whoa, whoa.

08:45.158 --> 08:45.959
I'm trying to learn
to defend myself

08:45.993 --> 08:47.661
against regular guys,
not boxers.

08:47.695 --> 08:49.229
That's what I'm saying.

08:49.262 --> 08:51.131
If you can stay out
of the way of a real boxer,

08:51.164 --> 08:53.734
a regular guy is never gonna
be able to lay a hand on you.

08:53.767 --> 08:56.069
Look, the fact is, I
think you got talent.

08:56.103 --> 08:59.006
And I could use your help
with some sparring.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.675
I'll sweeten
the pot for you.

09:01.709 --> 09:03.010
I'll give you two passes

09:03.043 --> 09:05.245
to the closed-circuit
Tyson-Bonecrusher fight.

09:05.278 --> 09:06.279
What do you say?

09:06.313 --> 09:07.648
Dude, you have to do this.

09:07.681 --> 09:08.649
It's a no-brainer.

09:08.682 --> 09:10.183
If you had no brain,

09:10.217 --> 09:11.752
wouldn't you make
bad decisions?

09:13.053 --> 09:14.154
Whoa.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.358
You see?

09:18.391 --> 09:19.627
I need you.

09:19.660 --> 09:21.261
You need me.

09:21.294 --> 09:23.797
And we need those tickets.

09:23.831 --> 09:25.165
So it's a win-win.

09:25.198 --> 09:28.802
Said the guy
who didn't get punched.

09:32.740 --> 09:34.875
While Drew watched Darlene
through a window,

09:34.908 --> 09:37.878
Darlene watched my father
through Coke-bottle glasses.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.346
* Walking down the street

09:39.379 --> 09:42.382
* Watching ladies go by,
watching you... *

09:42.415 --> 09:44.384
Hey, Julius!

09:44.417 --> 09:46.987
I was just coming
to look for you.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.989
You were?
Yeah.

09:49.022 --> 09:50.323
This is gonna sound crazy.

09:50.357 --> 09:51.992
You are not gonna believe this,

09:52.025 --> 09:53.794
but I got some of your mail.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.262
Isn't that crazy?

09:55.295 --> 09:56.830
That's crazy. Yeah.

09:56.864 --> 09:58.331
Not as crazy as her.

09:58.365 --> 10:01.702
It is so crazy how we live
right behind each other.

10:01.735 --> 10:02.903
Yeah.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.237
I guess I'll be seeing
a lot more of you

10:04.271 --> 10:05.806
if they keep messing up
our mail like this.

10:05.839 --> 10:07.808
I don't mind if you don't.

10:07.841 --> 10:10.811
Looks like you got more
of my mail than me.

10:10.844 --> 10:12.646
Isn't that crazy?

10:12.680 --> 10:13.914
Yeah, it's crazy.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.248
Thanks.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.316
I'll see you later.

10:16.349 --> 10:19.319
Yes, you will.

10:19.352 --> 10:22.422
* ...Made up my mind,
but I'm lookin'.... *

10:22.455 --> 10:24.958
While my father was dealing
with a crazy woman,

10:24.992 --> 10:27.294
I was starting to feel
like a crazy man.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.032
Ah, I'm glad you showed up.

10:32.065 --> 10:33.066
I'm not.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.968
So who do you want
me to spar with?

10:35.002 --> 10:36.169
Painmaker.

10:42.442 --> 10:45.378
I was about to fight Painmaker,
and the phone bill

10:45.412 --> 10:48.048
was about to cause my father
some pain of his own.

10:48.081 --> 10:49.316
What?

10:49.349 --> 10:52.185
Who's been making phone calls
at midnight?

10:52.219 --> 10:53.921
Two dollars, thank you.

10:53.954 --> 10:56.724
Meanwhile, Drew's window
was attracting more perverts

10:56.757 --> 10:58.726
than Times Square.
Gracias.

11:01.862 --> 11:03.831
Hey.
Hey.

11:03.864 --> 11:06.299
What's up, Dad?
You haven't been playing on the
phone at midnight, have you?

11:06.333 --> 11:08.201
Nope. Wasn't me.

11:08.235 --> 11:10.037
What about
Tonya or Chris?

11:10.070 --> 11:11.404
I don't think so.

11:11.438 --> 11:14.207
Why do you have that window open
like that?

11:14.241 --> 11:15.375
Somebody could come
in here and steal

11:15.408 --> 11:17.310
our whole house.
Not with me in here.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.479
Oh, after
you opened it,

11:19.512 --> 11:21.014
I couldn't get it shut again.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.156
Thanks, Dad.
Okay.

11:29.189 --> 11:32.192
* You're stepping so high...

11:32.225 --> 11:35.395
Hey, hey, there she is!
Showtime.

11:35.428 --> 11:37.130
This gives
a whole other meaning

11:37.164 --> 11:38.799
to Neighborhood Watch.

11:40.233 --> 11:41.802
See that right there.
Whoo!

11:48.408 --> 11:49.810
That's nasty.

11:49.843 --> 11:51.011
Are you serious?!

11:54.081 --> 11:55.115
All right,
now don't forget:

11:55.148 --> 11:57.084
just keep bobbing
and weaving.

11:57.117 --> 11:59.186
Bobbing and weaving, right?

11:59.219 --> 11:59.887
Go get him, Champ.

11:59.920 --> 12:03.056
Champ

12:08.361 --> 12:10.397
*

12:38.959 --> 12:40.327
To your corner.

12:40.360 --> 12:41.561
Dude, that was incredible.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.797
Good job, Chris.
That's what you do.

12:43.831 --> 12:45.498
I knew you had it in you.
How you feel?

12:45.532 --> 12:48.068
(speaking gibberish
through mouthpiece)

12:48.101 --> 12:51.571
I just said, "Somebody please
take my mouthpiece out."

12:51.604 --> 12:55.508
By dinnertime I wasn't hungry
because I was full of myself.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.479
Where's your mother?
She's at work.

12:59.512 --> 13:02.082
But I gave away my extra shift
so I could see her.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.050
Well, she took an extra shift

13:03.083 --> 13:04.918
because she thought
you were working late.

13:04.952 --> 13:06.954
I need to call her.

13:11.859 --> 13:13.126
For a woman, there's only

13:13.160 --> 13:16.429
one thing that replaces a man:
a pity party.

13:16.463 --> 13:22.903
:
* All by myself

13:22.936 --> 13:24.872
* Don't want to be

13:24.905 --> 13:29.442
* All by myself

13:29.476 --> 13:32.412
* Anymore.

13:32.445 --> 13:34.447
While my mother
was shaking with emotion,

13:34.481 --> 13:36.616
Tonya was shaking down Drew.

13:38.551 --> 13:40.520
So how much
are you charging them?

13:40.553 --> 13:42.189
What are you talking about?

13:42.222 --> 13:43.423
I'm talking about you

13:43.456 --> 13:45.358
and your nasty friends
peeping on that lady.

13:45.392 --> 13:46.860
:
Shut up.

13:46.894 --> 13:48.228
Keep your voice down.

13:48.261 --> 13:50.330
I figure you're charging them
two dollars a head.

13:50.363 --> 13:51.631
I want half.

13:51.664 --> 13:52.832
I'm not giving you a dime

13:52.866 --> 13:56.136
because if you tell I was
looking, I'm going to tell Mama

13:56.169 --> 13:57.604
about the liquor and cigarettes
you've been hiding

13:57.637 --> 13:59.139
in your room.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.274
I didn't hide any liquor
or cigarettes in my room.

14:01.308 --> 14:03.010
Oh, you didn't?

14:03.043 --> 14:04.444
Maybe it was me.

14:11.985 --> 14:14.054
While Drew
had Tonya's number,

14:14.087 --> 14:17.657
my father was running down
the midnight number.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.129
MAN :
This is Lawrence.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.064
How you doing, baby?

14:24.097 --> 14:26.466
Not good.

14:28.068 --> 14:29.269
Hey, fellas.

14:29.302 --> 14:30.270
Here's your tickets

14:30.303 --> 14:32.205
to the closed-circuit
Tyson-Bonecrusher fight.

14:34.374 --> 14:35.308
Hey, Sugar Hill.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.377
What'd you just call me?

14:37.410 --> 14:39.079
Oh-ho-ho, everybody,

14:39.112 --> 14:40.914
get back;
stand back.

14:40.948 --> 14:42.950
I don't want to miss this.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.251
I called you "Sugar Hill."

14:44.284 --> 14:45.418
What's the matter

14:45.452 --> 14:47.587
Hey, hey, hey!
What is this?

14:47.620 --> 14:49.923
Four against one.
That ain't a fair fight.

14:49.957 --> 14:51.458
That's the point
of four against one.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.126
Don't worry, Coach.
I can handle this.

14:53.160 --> 14:55.428
Oh, yeah?

14:58.098 --> 14:59.532
Hit me.

15:02.602 --> 15:04.271
Ha, ha-ha!

15:04.304 --> 15:06.306
You see?
You can't touch my guy.

15:06.339 --> 15:08.441
Scram! Beat it!
Let's go. Go ahead. Go ahead.

15:08.475 --> 15:10.010
Yeah, that's right.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.244
Walk away.

15:11.278 --> 15:14.014
Wow! I didn't know
you could fight like that.

15:14.047 --> 15:15.315
That's Chris.

15:15.348 --> 15:16.349
I'm his friend.

15:16.383 --> 15:18.418
Shut up.
All right.

15:18.451 --> 15:19.619
I box down at the gym.

15:19.652 --> 15:21.154
Can I come down and watch you?

15:21.188 --> 15:22.122
Yeah, sure.

15:22.155 --> 15:23.656
Coach, you got anybody else
for me to take?

15:23.690 --> 15:26.359
Oh, sure. You could, uh,
you could spar with Julio.

15:26.393 --> 15:27.560
Doesn't make any difference
to me

15:27.594 --> 15:28.661
whether I'm not getting hit
by Painmaker

15:28.695 --> 15:29.662
or not getting hit by Julio.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.231
I'll set it up.

15:31.264 --> 15:32.299
Who is Julio anyway?

15:32.332 --> 15:34.034
My Silver Shorts champion.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.735
"Silver Shorts"?
Doesn't that mean, like,

15:35.768 --> 15:37.270
the best boxer in the city?

15:37.304 --> 15:39.339
Yeah. What's the difference?

15:39.372 --> 15:40.407
I'll see you there.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.976
Not if I leave town.

15:48.648 --> 15:50.583
While I had to get
in the ring with Julio,

15:50.617 --> 15:53.020
my father had to get in a round
with my mother.

15:53.053 --> 15:55.122
Rochelle, we need to talk.

15:55.155 --> 15:56.623
Okay, baby, in a minute.

15:56.656 --> 15:58.758
Oh, open that window.
It's stuck.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.960
I need some air.

16:08.301 --> 16:09.669
(turns radio on,
Slave's "Watching You" plays)

16:09.702 --> 16:11.271
* There you go swayin'

16:11.304 --> 16:14.674
* Blowing my mind...

16:14.707 --> 16:17.044
I'll be downstairs.

16:17.077 --> 16:19.246
Okay.

16:22.382 --> 16:24.284
Oh, he opened it too high.

16:25.752 --> 16:28.121
* You can tell...
* Walking down the street *

16:28.155 --> 16:33.293
* Watching ladies go by,
watching you *

16:33.326 --> 16:36.063
* Hope that you can tell...
What is this?

16:36.096 --> 16:38.031
* Walking down the street,
watching ladies *

16:38.065 --> 16:40.567
* Go by, watching you...

16:43.603 --> 16:45.738
Drew, tell your father
I'll be right back.

16:45.772 --> 16:47.607
Okay.

16:49.609 --> 16:51.811
While my mother prepared
for a showdown,

16:51.844 --> 16:53.680
I got ready for a beat-down.

17:11.598 --> 17:14.234
We already have the tickets
for the fight tomorrow night.

17:14.267 --> 17:15.435
Caruso can't touch you,

17:15.468 --> 17:17.237
and that girl you wanted
to try to impress,

17:17.270 --> 17:18.371
she didn't even show up.

17:18.405 --> 17:20.607
You really don't have to get
in the ring with that guy.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.342
You're right.
Let's just go.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.244
I'll tell Thurman
I got sick.

17:24.277 --> 17:26.213
Oh, there you are!

17:26.246 --> 17:27.380
I've been looking for you.

17:27.414 --> 17:28.715
Come on.
You're up next.

17:30.317 --> 17:32.485
Oh! My God!

17:32.519 --> 17:33.853
I am so sorry.
I didn't know.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.323
I-I, I am so...
oh, my God, I don't know

17:36.356 --> 17:38.358
what you must think of me.
I am so...

17:38.391 --> 17:40.227
Well...

17:40.260 --> 17:42.462
Well, if Julius
wasn't the one looking at me,

17:42.495 --> 17:44.231
then who was it?

17:49.169 --> 17:51.304
When is she gonna stop screaming
and start stripping?

17:51.338 --> 17:52.672
Man, that's my mom!

17:52.705 --> 17:54.407
I know.

17:54.441 --> 17:55.508
Back at the gym,

17:55.542 --> 17:58.111
I was out of the frying pan
and into the fire.

17:58.145 --> 18:00.113
THURMAN:
You said it yourself,

18:00.147 --> 18:01.781
"What difference does it make
not getting punched," right?

18:01.814 --> 18:04.751
"Float like a butterfly,
sting like a bee.

18:04.784 --> 18:08.121
His hands can't hit
what his eyes can't see."

18:08.155 --> 18:10.223
Up to that point,
I was perfecting my defense.

18:10.257 --> 18:13.193
But then I did something wrong.

18:13.226 --> 18:15.195
I decided to try my offense.

18:17.330 --> 18:18.431
Look out! Look out!

18:18.465 --> 18:19.766
Look out!

18:21.868 --> 18:23.836
:
"Get out of the way, Rock!
Get out of the way!"

18:27.440 --> 18:28.741
Get out of the way!

18:30.843 --> 18:32.779
Unfortunately, Julio believed

18:32.812 --> 18:35.615
the best offense
was a stronger offense.

18:37.417 --> 18:39.252
While my head was spinning,

18:39.286 --> 18:40.587
my father went
right to the point.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.223
What happened to you?
And who is Lawrence?

18:43.256 --> 18:45.792
How do you know about Lawrence?

18:45.825 --> 18:47.160
Wrong answer.

18:47.194 --> 18:48.361
I got the phone bill.

18:48.395 --> 18:51.298
You've been talking
to him every night.

18:51.331 --> 18:53.766
How lonely have
you been, Rochelle?

18:57.204 --> 18:58.205
This isn't funny.

18:58.238 --> 19:01.208
Yes, it is.

19:01.241 --> 19:02.575
Julius, Lawrence
is a radio deejay.

19:02.609 --> 19:04.411
I told you

19:04.444 --> 19:07.314
I've been lonely,
so sometimes I call him

19:07.347 --> 19:09.716
and I ask him to play songs
that remind me of you.

19:09.749 --> 19:13.320
Hmm. But some of these calls
are for 30 minutes.

19:13.353 --> 19:15.488
Sometimes he puts me on hold.

19:17.224 --> 19:18.925
There's a lot of lonely people
out there, baby.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.529
Oh.

19:23.930 --> 19:25.665
You feel stupid, huh?

19:25.698 --> 19:27.867
Yeah.

19:29.269 --> 19:31.971
That's what's funny.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.573
It wasn't the attention

19:33.606 --> 19:35.508
my mother wanted,
but it did make her feel

19:35.542 --> 19:36.876
closer to my father.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.915
What happened?

19:42.949 --> 19:44.451
Champ knocked you out.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.554
Man, we better get going.
We're going to miss the fight.

19:47.587 --> 19:49.422
You already missed
the fight, stupid.

19:49.456 --> 19:50.723
It's over?

19:50.757 --> 19:53.393
Tyson won
in a ten-round decision.

19:53.426 --> 19:55.362
You've been in a coma
for three days.

19:55.395 --> 19:57.630
Doctor said you're going
to need your rest.

19:57.664 --> 20:00.233
When Julio hit you, he kind
of damaged your inner ear,

20:00.267 --> 20:01.834
so your equilibrium's off
a little bit.

20:01.868 --> 20:02.902
What's that mean?

20:02.935 --> 20:04.471
It means no more boxing.

20:04.504 --> 20:06.706
But the good news is
he didn't break your legs.

20:06.739 --> 20:07.807
So you can still run.

20:09.576 --> 20:11.778
No more boxing?
Really?

20:11.811 --> 20:13.480
Yeah, watch.

20:13.513 --> 20:16.249
I'm going to come at you
