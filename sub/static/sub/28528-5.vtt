01:27.420 --> 01:29.422
Lord...

01:30.303 --> 01:32.544
give me your wisdom.

01:32.546 --> 01:34.748
You have called me
to be Queen of England.

01:36.510 --> 01:38.872
Shall I take the king
to be my husband?

01:40.994 --> 01:43.917
Why don't you speak to me?

01:46.520 --> 01:48.440
<i>How dare you challenge me?</i>

01:48.442 --> 01:49.962
<i>It was your mother's
dying wish.</i>

01:49.964 --> 01:51.763
<i>Does that
mean nothing to you?</i>

01:51.765 --> 01:54.406
She was dying!
She was in agony!

01:54.408 --> 01:56.809
And you would put yourself
ahead of the queen's command?

01:56.811 --> 01:58.691
No. I think that you
asked this from her.

01:58.693 --> 02:01.013
Why would her final wish

02:01.015 --> 02:03.015
be to take away
my happiness?

02:03.017 --> 02:05.337
You always think everything
is happening to you.

02:05.339 --> 02:07.580
- No, I think, Father, that you are jealous...
- Ohh!

02:07.582 --> 02:10.342
...jealous of
my confidence and my courage.

02:10.345 --> 02:12.385
And I think
you seek to take away

02:12.387 --> 02:14.389
the one thing
that I desire.

02:17.712 --> 02:20.713
What did we do
to make him as he is?

02:21.956 --> 02:23.796
As if this wasn't
already hard enough.

02:23.798 --> 02:25.838
For once in my life,
I find myself agreeing

02:25.840 --> 02:28.962
with your late wife,
God rest her soul.

02:28.964 --> 02:30.643
- Mm.
- I now see the wisdom

02:30.645 --> 02:32.846
of this union
with the girl.

02:32.848 --> 02:34.728
I'll soothe
our hothead.

02:34.730 --> 02:36.970
You go and see
your new wife-to-be.

02:36.972 --> 02:39.813
Uh, is this for me?

02:39.815 --> 02:43.697
Sir Richard Pole left it for me
because I refused to see him.

02:43.699 --> 02:47.663
He pleads for his
wife's return, no doubt.

02:48.944 --> 02:52.065
She disobeyed our rule,
Henry.

02:52.067 --> 02:54.069
I will not have that.

03:21.538 --> 03:23.980
<i>Princess
Catherine, welcome.</i>

03:25.462 --> 03:27.464
This way,
Your Highness.

03:46.563 --> 03:48.686
Why do you smile,
Your Grace?

03:49.887 --> 03:51.887
I smile, because
we're both clearly

03:51.889 --> 03:55.130
having such
a splendid time of it.

03:56.694 --> 03:58.696
<i>When one is king...</i>

03:59.136 --> 04:03.979
one dines for many reasons
with many guests...

04:03.981 --> 04:06.862
for politics,
to gain intelligence,

04:06.864 --> 04:09.785
to push a truce...

04:09.787 --> 04:11.789
to pursue a bride.

04:14.672 --> 04:17.753
I'm not unfamiliar with the sensation
of this table growing longer

04:17.755 --> 04:21.077
nor the food growing
more tasteless upon the plate.

04:21.079 --> 04:24.963
I'm sorry. I do not wish
to take away your appetite.

04:26.645 --> 04:28.885
Did you and the queen
take all your meals in here?

04:28.887 --> 04:30.889
<i>Goodness, no.</i>

04:31.650 --> 04:33.009
Look at it!

04:36.735 --> 04:39.578
Arthur liked to eat
under the trees.

04:40.859 --> 04:42.779
<i>He would have taken
all his meals outside,</i>

04:42.781 --> 04:45.582
come wind or rain.

04:45.584 --> 04:48.105
As did his mother...

04:48.107 --> 04:50.109
given the chance.

04:51.790 --> 04:53.590
<i>When we were first wed,</i>

04:53.592 --> 04:56.916
I arranged picnics for her
throughout the grounds.

04:58.918 --> 05:02.119
I tried everything
to warm her heart.

05:02.121 --> 05:03.320
She was cold to you?

05:03.322 --> 05:04.642
Mm.

05:04.644 --> 05:06.884
<i>But you
were so in love.</i>

05:06.886 --> 05:08.888
A blind man
could see it.

05:09.929 --> 05:12.652
The battle for her heart
was hard-won.

05:14.254 --> 05:17.457
Winning the throne of England
was less arduous.

05:18.017 --> 05:20.618
<i>When did you know</i>

05:20.620 --> 05:23.101
that she loved you?

05:23.103 --> 05:25.105
I cannot
tell you the hour.

05:26.947 --> 05:31.832
Only that one day I was aware
of a peace in my heart...

05:33.633 --> 05:35.876
a sense that
when I was with her...

05:37.557 --> 05:39.560
I was home.

05:42.683 --> 05:45.486
<i>You know, you have
the look of her in your eyes.</i>

05:51.011 --> 05:53.692
You both had mothers who...

05:53.694 --> 05:57.776
not so much raised you,
but smelted you.

06:00.821 --> 06:02.902
I am a lump of steel.

06:08.309 --> 06:10.029
There.

06:10.031 --> 06:13.034
Who said
I cannot woo a woman?

06:17.719 --> 06:19.721
Come.

06:20.201 --> 06:22.804
Now that your Infanta
is to wed the king...

06:24.926 --> 06:28.047
your own marriages
must be addressed.

06:28.049 --> 06:31.010
Charles Brandon
has selected you,

06:31.012 --> 06:32.892
and both
the Duke of Rochester

06:32.894 --> 06:35.655
and the 11th Baron
Willoughby de Eresby

06:35.657 --> 06:37.659
will each
be offered you.

06:38.700 --> 06:41.421
I was told I was to have
a say in who I wed.

06:41.423 --> 06:45.025
Well, perhaps you might have if
Prince Arthur had not passed away,

06:45.027 --> 06:47.027
but now the choice
is mine alone,

06:47.029 --> 06:48.749
<i>and my sole
consideration</i>

06:48.751 --> 06:52.272
is that you marry loyal
men within my house.

06:52.274 --> 06:55.275
Will you still wait for Catherine's
dowry to be paid by Queen Isabella?

06:55.277 --> 06:57.077
There's no need.

06:57.079 --> 06:59.081
The alliance
is preserved.

07:00.042 --> 07:01.922
<i>But she will not become
queen in her own...</i>

07:10.693 --> 07:11.692
<i>Rosa!</i>

07:11.694 --> 07:14.135
- Rosa...
- Stay away!

07:14.137 --> 07:16.657
It is the plague,

07:16.659 --> 07:17.859
the sweating plague.

07:17.861 --> 07:18.900
Help me, Jesus.

07:18.902 --> 07:20.942
Ay, no.

07:20.944 --> 07:22.223
There is no sweat.

07:22.225 --> 07:23.945
It was
the guinea fowl.

07:23.947 --> 07:25.747
It must have
been too old.

07:25.749 --> 07:28.069
She ate some bad food.

07:28.071 --> 07:30.472
Did she?

07:30.474 --> 07:32.233
It was
the guinea fowl.

07:32.235 --> 07:34.676
The two men
who may wed you

07:34.678 --> 07:36.918
will be waiting
in the Great Hall.

07:36.920 --> 07:39.841
They will look at you
as you pass by.

07:39.843 --> 07:42.003
It may aid
the path of love

07:42.005 --> 07:44.808
were you to wipe the
vomit from your chin.

07:53.817 --> 07:55.820
<i>Vamos.</i>

08:11.796 --> 08:15.838
Ladies, I give you
the Duke of Rochester...

08:15.840 --> 08:17.079
My ladies.

08:17.081 --> 08:19.842
and the 11th Baron
Willoughby de Eresby.

08:19.844 --> 08:21.846
Enchanted.

08:43.549 --> 08:45.789
The king insisted
I be brought back here

08:45.791 --> 08:48.392
so I could have
my portrait started, bu...

08:48.394 --> 08:51.194
Where is Rosa going?

08:51.196 --> 08:52.436
She is unwell, Highness.

08:52.438 --> 08:54.440
I am finished
with this today.

08:56.122 --> 08:58.482
He has written to my mother

08:58.484 --> 09:01.805
to ask her for her blessing
on our marriage,

09:01.807 --> 09:04.368
but I don't believe I have been
blessed since I left Spain.

09:04.370 --> 09:06.811
Then perhaps you should
return to Castile.

09:06.813 --> 09:09.373
Go back to your mother.
Find another life.

09:09.375 --> 09:11.415
At least you
have that option.

09:11.417 --> 09:13.419
I do not.

09:18.825 --> 09:20.865
Lina?

09:20.867 --> 09:22.869
Lina!

09:23.790 --> 09:25.792
Why do you
talk to me this way?

09:27.274 --> 09:30.915
I have supported you
in every way I can

09:30.917 --> 09:33.158
and perhaps some ways
that I should not.

09:33.160 --> 09:36.801
I have
been loyal to you.

09:36.803 --> 09:39.124
And now the king
says he'll have you,

09:39.126 --> 09:41.206
so you should
rejoice in victory

09:41.208 --> 09:43.528
and take the orange that
has landed in your lap.

09:43.530 --> 09:48.333
If your destiny is to be Queen of
England, take the king,

09:48.335 --> 09:52.538
but if
your dream is love,

09:52.540 --> 09:55.300
then that is
all I want, too.

09:55.302 --> 09:57.423
Then find love
with your husband.

09:57.425 --> 09:59.425
Charlie Brandon?

09:59.427 --> 10:01.429
I cannot love a fool!

10:03.070 --> 10:06.232
I am in love
with Oviedo,

10:06.234 --> 10:08.073
the bowman,

10:08.075 --> 10:10.116
who is not a Tudor,

10:10.118 --> 10:13.439
nor a noble,
nor an Englishman.

10:13.441 --> 10:15.641
Nor is he Catholic.

10:15.643 --> 10:17.645
I've been told
he worships Islam.

10:18.967 --> 10:20.326
There is
no law against it

10:20.328 --> 10:21.888
here in England,

10:21.890 --> 10:25.451
but in Spain,
if we went back,

10:25.453 --> 10:30.098
he would be tortured
by your mother.

10:31.299 --> 10:32.979
And perhaps
I would be, too,

10:32.981 --> 10:36.302
because they don't believe
those who converted.

10:36.304 --> 10:38.427
My mother would do
no such thing.

10:40.349 --> 10:42.589
It must have been
the church.

10:42.591 --> 10:44.591
If I wed Oviedo,

10:44.593 --> 10:48.155
who will cast me
from your service?

10:48.157 --> 10:49.916
Is it the king?

10:49.918 --> 10:52.199
Lady Margaret Beaufort?

10:52.201 --> 10:54.443
Or is it you?

10:57.326 --> 10:59.328
Lina...

11:01.170 --> 11:03.490
you came here
for a better life.

11:03.492 --> 11:05.212
Now, if you
throw it all away,

11:05.214 --> 11:08.896
how would you live,
raise children?

11:08.898 --> 11:10.898
The men the Tudors
took from me,

11:10.900 --> 11:12.340
including
your man Oviedo,

11:12.342 --> 11:14.982
are not
even paid a wage.

11:14.984 --> 11:17.945
They work
for food and lodging.

11:17.947 --> 11:19.987
You cannot
raise a child on that.

11:19.989 --> 11:22.550
I have some money that my
parents left me when they died,

11:22.552 --> 11:24.272
and then I'll think
of something I can...

11:24.274 --> 11:26.034
What thing would you
think of, Lina,

11:26.036 --> 11:29.479
to support yourself, your
husband, and your children?

11:31.161 --> 11:32.600
I...

11:32.602 --> 11:34.604
You have a duty...

11:35.365 --> 11:38.166
to my mother and to me
and to your parents,

11:38.168 --> 11:41.369
who worked their lives
to send you here for this.

11:41.371 --> 11:43.371
You will tell me
when you've chosen

11:43.373 --> 11:45.293
if you will take
your Tudor husband

11:45.295 --> 11:48.218
or will leave
my household.

12:34.546 --> 12:36.548
<i>My Lord!</i>

12:39.471 --> 12:41.473
Easy, there.

12:45.437 --> 12:47.677
Richard.
How is Westminster?

12:47.679 --> 12:49.800
I tried to speak
to Lady Margaret,

12:49.802 --> 12:52.484
but she seems quite certain
of your treachery.

12:54.246 --> 12:56.406
I have always
been a Plantagenet

12:56.408 --> 12:59.049
and always been
the enemy to her.

12:59.051 --> 13:03.133
Yet in her anger,
Lady Margaret has done me a great service.

13:03.135 --> 13:06.136
I may stay here
with my children

13:06.138 --> 13:08.579
in the country,
free from all of them.

13:08.581 --> 13:11.182
You think she will let
you stay here in peace?

13:11.184 --> 13:13.464
You think she won't break
you every chance she gets?

13:13.466 --> 13:15.626
You defied her, Maggie.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.268
I love my children,

13:17.270 --> 13:19.310
and I would die for them.

13:19.312 --> 13:21.712
I know you would,
so lie for them!

13:21.714 --> 13:25.356
Tell Lady Margaret Arthur's
marriage was a full one.

13:25.358 --> 13:28.039
No. I have told
that woman what I know,

13:28.041 --> 13:30.401
and only what I know
to be the truth,

13:30.403 --> 13:32.684
that I didn't see Catherine
and Arthur with my own eyes.

13:32.686 --> 13:34.566
You tread
a dangerous path.

13:34.568 --> 13:37.128
I tread a narrow one,
I know,

13:37.130 --> 13:40.332
but that path
is my conscience.

13:40.334 --> 13:43.335
The Tudors have taken
a great deal from me, Richard,

13:43.337 --> 13:45.339
but they
will not take that.

13:48.582 --> 13:52.586
The king says
he will marry Catherine.

13:54.108 --> 13:56.470
I suppose that
eases things a little.

14:12.206 --> 14:16.329
Maggie, if you've heard from your
cousin, you must say so.

14:16.331 --> 14:18.691
It may even save
your place at court.

14:18.693 --> 14:20.373
Have you heard
nothing that I have said?

14:20.375 --> 14:22.895
I do not want
a place at court.

14:22.897 --> 14:25.180
And I have
not heard from him.

14:47.403 --> 14:48.442
Harry.

14:48.444 --> 14:51.405
We will fight him,
Catherine.

14:51.407 --> 14:54.368
Tell your mother
to refuse the match.

14:54.370 --> 14:57.731
Your children won't succeed
you if they're sired with him,

14:57.733 --> 15:00.374
and your mother surely doesn't
want a barren throne for you.

15:00.376 --> 15:02.256
She may not even care
about that anymore.

15:02.258 --> 15:04.538
We don't know
what she'll say.

15:04.540 --> 15:07.862
Well, then you must tell him
no, that you won't have him.

15:07.864 --> 15:12.306
How should I refuse him,
Harry, the King of England?

15:12.308 --> 15:14.188
Do you think
he will smile kindly

15:14.190 --> 15:16.631
on my marriage to his son
if I insult him

15:16.633 --> 15:19.433
and drive a dagger
in his pride?

15:19.435 --> 15:20.755
I cannot disobey
the king.

15:20.757 --> 15:22.196
Why not?

15:22.198 --> 15:23.598
Because he'd send me
back to Spain.

15:23.600 --> 15:25.480
But you are
your mother's daughter.

15:25.482 --> 15:28.084
You don't hear no.
You fight.

15:29.806 --> 15:32.367
What, did you trifle with me
just to win my father?

15:32.369 --> 15:34.409
No!

15:34.411 --> 15:36.413
Of course I didn't.

15:36.973 --> 15:39.296
If you want him, say so...

15:40.617 --> 15:42.619
and I'll know you
for a devil in a dress.

15:47.304 --> 15:48.784
You don't know, do you?

15:48.786 --> 15:51.226
How is this my doing?

15:51.228 --> 15:52.828
How is this at my door?!

15:52.830 --> 15:54.630
You don't know
what you want.

15:54.632 --> 15:56.634
I don't know
what my choices are!

15:57.635 --> 16:00.315
I don't know
if I have a choice.

16:00.317 --> 16:01.517
Well, damn you, then.

16:01.519 --> 16:03.679
If your love is so fickle

16:03.681 --> 16:05.763
that it can
blow away like dust...

16:07.645 --> 16:09.647
I will forget you.

16:18.496 --> 16:23.740
<i>"Dearest Meg,
it warmed my heart to get your letter.</i>

16:23.742 --> 16:25.742
<i>I couldn't bear it
that you thought</i>

16:25.744 --> 16:27.746
<i>I hadn't said goodbye
to you in London.</i>

16:38.797 --> 16:41.238
<i>What a joy to read
that you do not believe</i>

16:41.240 --> 16:44.361
<i>your life in Scotland
will be unpleasant.</i>

16:44.363 --> 16:46.283
<i>I hear he is
an accomplished man</i>

16:46.285 --> 16:48.525
<i>and interested in everything.</i>

16:48.527 --> 16:51.488
<i>Although a nursery
full of bastard children</i>

16:51.490 --> 16:53.810
<i>is more than I would bear
on my arrival,</i>

16:53.812 --> 16:56.695
<i>so I think you are
a stronger woman than I am.</i>

16:58.057 --> 17:00.297
<i>I'm glad that you
are happy, though,</i>

17:00.299 --> 17:02.301
<i>and I report the same.</i>

17:03.342 --> 17:05.342
<i>My only sorrow
is my husband,</i>

17:05.344 --> 17:07.346
<i>as I know I've
disappointed him.</i>

17:09.709 --> 17:12.231
<i>Your loving aunt, Maggie."</i>

17:31.972 --> 17:34.734
Was that caused
by the guinea fowl as well?

17:38.739 --> 17:42.583
Rosa, when did you
last bleed?

17:44.585 --> 17:47.546
I don't know.

17:47.548 --> 17:49.788
Some weeks ago.

17:49.790 --> 17:51.390
How many weeks?

17:51.392 --> 17:54.395
Four? Six?

17:58.719 --> 18:01.920
I must talk
to Stafford.

18:01.922 --> 18:03.322
I must tell him.

18:03.324 --> 18:04.643
No!

18:04.645 --> 18:07.006
Rosa, he is married.

18:07.008 --> 18:09.608
If you tell him,
he will deny it was him,

18:09.610 --> 18:12.131
and he will abandon you.

18:12.133 --> 18:14.413
No!

18:14.415 --> 18:16.577
He would
never leave me.

18:24.906 --> 18:27.469
Do you know what they do
to unmarried mothers?

18:30.792 --> 18:33.953
You wouldn't
just be flogged.

18:33.955 --> 18:36.796
You would lose your place
with the Infanta

18:36.798 --> 18:41.563
and be begging on the
streets with a tiny baby.

18:44.766 --> 18:47.487
Wh-What should I do?

18:47.489 --> 18:51.053
Lina, help me.

18:54.016 --> 18:56.176
Maximilian
has yet again refused

18:56.178 --> 18:58.899
to hand over the traitor
Edmund de la Pool.

18:58.901 --> 19:01.742
- - We've offered
trade deals, money.

19:01.744 --> 19:03.824
God knows his country
needs it,

19:03.826 --> 19:06.066
but still
he has refused.

19:06.068 --> 19:08.311
He is coming for me.

19:09.512 --> 19:13.674
Dudley, where's my army?

19:13.676 --> 19:15.596
<i>Ah, yes, Your Grace.</i>

19:15.598 --> 19:17.600
Your Grace.

19:20.723 --> 19:24.926
<i>The military expansion
is a costly venture...</i>

19:24.928 --> 19:26.930
Uh, sorry.
Why do we need men?

19:28.531 --> 19:30.652
Wh-Why are we
expanding?

19:30.654 --> 19:34.015
Because the threat of an invasion
led by Edmund de la Pool...

19:34.017 --> 19:37.340
Oh, right.
Um, de la Pool, the York.

19:38.782 --> 19:40.021
Yes.

19:40.023 --> 19:42.025
Yes.

19:43.867 --> 19:46.588
<i>We had agreed
on a defense tax,</i>

19:46.590 --> 19:49.111
but it'll take time to raise
the funds to pay the men...

19:49.113 --> 19:51.153
Well, then
don't raise them.

19:51.155 --> 19:54.716
You are hell-bent
on robbing the people.

19:54.718 --> 19:59.641
Pull men from the armies
of all the nobles sitting here.

19:59.643 --> 20:03.726
Stafford, how large
is your retinue,

20:03.728 --> 20:06.689
<i>300 men, 400?</i>

20:06.691 --> 20:08.651
<i>If we centralize
the military,</i>

20:08.653 --> 20:10.733
my father
wouldn't have to beg

20:10.735 --> 20:14.697
and simper to you all
like a serving maid.

20:16.621 --> 20:21.584
My son is angry,

20:21.586 --> 20:26.749
because a girl who has his
young heart in her keeping

20:26.751 --> 20:30.395
prefers a king to a boy.

20:32.037 --> 20:35.879
But if he spent less time
on girls and ale,

20:35.881 --> 20:38.161
he would know
that we are already

20:38.163 --> 20:42.085
drawing men from all
these noble houses!

20:42.087 --> 20:46.970
And so your contribution to this
privy council is of no use whatsoever!

20:46.972 --> 20:48.171
<i>Gentlemen,
please leave us.</i>

20:48.173 --> 20:50.576
The council
is dismissed.

20:59.185 --> 21:01.745
Ale can be
a marvelous thing.

21:01.747 --> 21:05.669
It lures me into taverns
on a quest for insobriety,

21:05.671 --> 21:11.117
but while you men
grow old with talk...

21:12.759 --> 21:14.761
I discover.

21:16.042 --> 21:19.085
De la Pool is here,
in London.

21:27.814 --> 21:29.816
Harry.

21:30.937 --> 21:32.939
Harry!

21:33.660 --> 21:35.662
<i>Harry.</i>

21:36.263 --> 21:39.064
So it's true,
Edmund de la Pool is here?

21:39.066 --> 21:41.826
It's not difficult to rule,

21:41.828 --> 21:43.989
to find out
what you want to know,

21:43.991 --> 21:46.551
if the people love you.

21:50.357 --> 21:52.359
Where is he?

21:54.802 --> 21:56.562
He's very near the palace.

21:56.564 --> 21:58.566
Where is he?!

21:59.246 --> 22:01.609
I will deal with this.

22:10.858 --> 22:12.858
I don't know what you're
so up in arms about.

22:12.860 --> 22:14.940
You always want me
at the council meetings.

22:14.942 --> 22:16.983
If you cut yourself off
from your father,

22:16.985 --> 22:20.869
you cut yourself off from
the source of your power.

22:22.310 --> 22:25.752
There's an apothecary
on Charm Street,

22:25.754 --> 22:27.836
and de la Pool
is hiding there.

22:29.718 --> 22:33.239
You know, sometimes I
wonder about you, Harry.

22:33.241 --> 22:38.126
Are you ever for England
or only for yourself?

22:49.698 --> 22:51.700
- We're up, soldier.
- Aye.

22:56.745 --> 22:58.747
<i>Hello.</i>

23:07.076 --> 23:11.961
I was hoping you might ask
the women of the kitchens

23:13.082 --> 23:15.723
where a lady goes for help

23:15.725 --> 23:21.611
if she should find herself
unwed with child.

23:23.333 --> 23:25.335
Rosa.

23:27.057 --> 23:28.456
I cannot ask them,

23:28.458 --> 23:30.258
or my honor
will be questioned,

23:30.260 --> 23:31.779
which would damage
the Infanta.

23:32.943 --> 23:34.983
If you ask,
they will think that...

23:34.985 --> 23:38.108
That I have been dishonorable
and want to cover my mistakes?

23:45.155 --> 23:48.837
I am <i>promovido,</i>

23:48.839 --> 23:50.719
groom to the armory.

23:50.721 --> 23:52.961
Promoted?

23:52.963 --> 23:54.965
I am pleased for you.

23:56.247 --> 23:59.610
And are there wages for it?

24:01.132 --> 24:03.412
There are other things
than money, Lina.

24:03.414 --> 24:06.135
Is Margaret Pole at court?

24:06.137 --> 24:09.018
Perhaps she
will take pity on me.

24:09.020 --> 24:11.420
She is not
welcome here no more.

24:11.422 --> 24:14.145
The king's mother
told her to get out.

24:20.512 --> 24:23.312
The men say
there is <i>un burdel</i>

24:23.314 --> 24:26.155
in Bankside
above the tavern.

24:26.157 --> 24:28.157
A whorehouse?

24:28.159 --> 24:30.161
The women there
will help Rosa.

24:31.443 --> 24:33.445
But...

24:50.863 --> 24:53.786
<i>Hey, dark mistress,
come sit by me.</i>

25:03.836 --> 25:05.838
Thank you.

25:12.044 --> 25:14.047
<i>Hold still, slave.</i>

25:21.094 --> 25:24.015
Come to work or...

25:24.017 --> 25:25.376
to get rid?

25:25.378 --> 25:28.299
Th-The second one.

25:28.301 --> 25:30.864
In my day,
it was catgut.

25:32.225 --> 25:34.065
They say it's all
much safer now.

25:34.067 --> 25:35.467
<i>Oh, here he goes.</i>

25:35.469 --> 25:37.389
Come on, Willoughby.
Good man.

25:37.391 --> 25:40.191
Here's upon
Willoughby!

25:41.995 --> 25:43.074
<i>That's it!</i>

25:43.076 --> 25:45.517
Willoughby,
Baron de Eresby?

25:45.519 --> 25:47.881
Yeah, the 11th.

25:49.083 --> 25:51.323
You're one of hers,
aren't you,

25:51.325 --> 25:52.484
that Spanish princess?

25:52.486 --> 25:54.486
No. You are mistaken.

25:54.488 --> 25:56.488
Be quite a scandal,
wouldn't it,

25:56.490 --> 25:59.932
highborn girl like you
flogged on Tower Hill?

25:59.934 --> 26:03.095
Bad news
for her princess-ship.

26:03.097 --> 26:05.257
She might not want you
in her gang no more.

26:05.259 --> 26:07.379
Do you have
what I need or not?

26:07.381 --> 26:12.266
I do, love,
but it'll cost you.

26:13.267 --> 26:14.467
How much?

26:14.469 --> 26:16.949
Of course,
if you can't pay,

26:16.951 --> 26:19.994
you can make a pretty penny
with your lovely skin.

26:21.356 --> 26:24.957
Lady Night-time.

26:24.959 --> 26:27.001
How much
will it cost?

26:28.964 --> 26:31.286
This'll do away
with the little problem.

26:36.291 --> 26:38.774
So what's it gonna be?

26:39.975 --> 26:41.014
Ha!

26:41.016 --> 26:43.018
Eh...

26:45.861 --> 26:49.102
You can't come in,
Lady Grandmother.

26:49.104 --> 26:50.303
Hmm.

26:50.305 --> 26:53.507
Unless you
bring more wine.

26:56.472 --> 26:58.474
My lady.

27:07.163 --> 27:09.203
The soldiers stormed the shop
and found his man,

27:09.205 --> 27:11.165
but de la Pool had gone.

27:11.167 --> 27:13.287
We questioned the man.

27:13.289 --> 27:14.608
No! No!

27:14.610 --> 27:17.972
No! No! No!

27:17.974 --> 27:20.136
In the end, he told us
his master had sailed.

27:21.457 --> 27:22.456
Perhaps if you'd
told us sooner,

27:22.458 --> 27:23.938
we'd have caught him.

27:23.940 --> 27:26.020
Perhaps my father
brought it on himself.

27:26.022 --> 27:29.904
And perhaps your blood will stain the
English soil for what you did today.

27:29.906 --> 27:32.106
De la Pool would cut
your throat in a heartbeat,

27:32.108 --> 27:33.548
but you let him slip the net

27:33.550 --> 27:36.191
and have safe passage
back to the Hapsburgs,

27:36.193 --> 27:38.233
and all because some
foreign girl has pitted you

27:38.235 --> 27:41.476
against your father like
some commoner in a brawl.

27:41.478 --> 27:45.000
Well, thank you for the
visit, Lady Grandmother.

27:45.002 --> 27:47.965
Will you ask Charlie to come
back in on your way out?

27:49.206 --> 27:51.406
What you feel for her
is lust.

27:51.408 --> 27:53.851
It's of the flesh.
It's not of the heart.

27:56.173 --> 28:00.255
You're... You're a healthy,
strong young man.

28:00.257 --> 28:04.502
You've had kingship thrust upon
you as a burden on your grief.

28:08.306 --> 28:11.227
Perhaps there are
some appetites

28:11.229 --> 28:16.114
that you've not had
free rein to... satisfy.

28:17.035 --> 28:19.437
What?

28:22.080 --> 28:25.203
<i>Lord Stafford has some
friends for you to meet.</i>

28:29.367 --> 28:32.330
While I go
to evening prayer.

29:05.004 --> 29:07.605
Thank you...

29:07.607 --> 29:09.969
but what I feel
is of the heart.

29:11.450 --> 29:15.334
If she wants my father,
I will step aside.

29:16.536 --> 29:19.136
But if she wants me,

29:19.138 --> 29:21.261
I will fight him...

29:22.662 --> 29:26.546
to the death,
if needs be.

29:39.119 --> 29:41.121
You have not bled?

29:47.848 --> 29:49.850
You...

29:51.051 --> 29:53.652
<i>put it up inside</i>

29:53.654 --> 29:56.457
if you do not wish
to have the baby.

29:57.858 --> 29:59.860
Where did you get it?

30:00.701 --> 30:02.983
It doesn't matter.

30:04.185 --> 30:07.508
Lina, I am afraid.

30:09.350 --> 30:11.510
Do you think
I should take Rochester

30:11.512 --> 30:13.632
or Willoughby instead?

30:13.634 --> 30:16.678
No, I don't.

30:18.680 --> 30:20.682
I don't.

30:34.656 --> 30:36.696
<i>Hello?</i>

30:50.192 --> 30:51.511
I'm coming in,
so don't say no.

30:51.513 --> 30:54.234
- I have something to say.
- But I came to you.

30:54.236 --> 30:57.277
You came to tell me
you will fight for me.

30:57.279 --> 30:58.318
Am I correct?

30:58.320 --> 31:00.240
- Yes, I...
- And you hate your father

31:00.242 --> 31:02.244
for stealing me away, and...

31:03.245 --> 31:04.565
and you want me to know

31:04.567 --> 31:08.449
that if I marry him,
I condemn myself

31:08.451 --> 31:12.213
to a miserable,
loveless life.

31:12.215 --> 31:13.534
That's right, yes.

31:13.536 --> 31:15.936
That is what people do.

31:15.938 --> 31:20.541
The prisoners begging for their
lives and offering contrition,

31:20.543 --> 31:22.503
they beg and plead,

31:22.505 --> 31:29.350
but their pleas are always met with
deafness for one simple reason,

31:29.352 --> 31:33.555
that they must go to the block
because the king decrees it.

31:33.557 --> 31:38.319
So you're saying you must
marry him because he said so.

31:38.321 --> 31:40.642
Because he is the king.

31:40.644 --> 31:45.168
I'm saying
there is duty...

31:46.650 --> 31:48.852
that both of us
must cleave to.

31:52.656 --> 31:57.339
You know, I admit that when I
first wrote to you in Spain,

31:57.341 --> 31:58.780
it... it was a game.

31:58.782 --> 32:03.667
But then the more I read
of you and knew you, I...

32:04.428 --> 32:08.871
Well, I haven't known as many
women as you think, Catherine,

32:08.873 --> 32:11.556
and those that I have
were of the flesh.

32:13.758 --> 32:15.880
You are not.

32:17.442 --> 32:19.362
I mean, I...

32:19.364 --> 32:21.886
I-I want to.

32:24.409 --> 32:27.650
But... But the point is that...

32:27.652 --> 32:29.654
the point is that...

32:32.457 --> 32:34.619
that I love you.

32:35.821 --> 32:40.223
And love exalts us
into God's arms.

32:40.225 --> 32:43.747
I-It is
his greatest gift to us.

32:43.749 --> 32:46.512
It makes us one with him.

32:47.793 --> 32:50.834
Catherine, it leaves duty
in the shadows.

32:50.836 --> 32:53.917
You are a wonder.

32:53.919 --> 32:56.360
You make me
yearn to be king

32:56.362 --> 32:58.522
so that I can be
a better man for you.

32:58.524 --> 33:00.646
You are a wordsmith.

33:02.688 --> 33:05.809
You bend words
to your whim.

33:05.811 --> 33:08.374
Well, then feel
what I'm saying.

33:28.475 --> 33:30.797
And then give me
your answer.

33:55.382 --> 33:56.862
A boy kisses you,

33:56.864 --> 33:59.344
and everything
I've taught you is undone.

33:59.346 --> 34:00.425
Leave me, <i>Madre.</i>

34:00.427 --> 34:02.107
He will bring you pain.

34:02.109 --> 34:05.631
The betrayal he will deal to
you, it will break the world.

34:05.633 --> 34:06.912
You are wrong.

34:06.914 --> 34:08.916
Guard yourself!

34:11.038 --> 34:13.759
If you do not, the enemy will
know just where to strike.

34:46.395 --> 34:50.319
Lady Pole is banished
from the court.

34:52.481 --> 34:55.601
My lady, the king's mother
says she lied for you.

34:55.603 --> 34:58.287
Banished?
For how long?

34:59.488 --> 35:01.490
Forever.

35:03.652 --> 35:05.655
Is she at her home
in Stourton?

35:07.456 --> 35:11.300
We will go to her,
this very moment, now.

36:16.527 --> 36:18.607
The king demands
we send him all our men.

36:18.609 --> 36:21.611
- All?
- We're being punished.

36:21.613 --> 36:24.614
Others may keep a small retinue.
We may not.

36:24.616 --> 36:26.618
This is more than taxes.

36:27.499 --> 36:29.018
Your cousin
was seen in London

36:29.020 --> 36:30.700
stirring up support.

36:30.702 --> 36:32.702
The king and his mother
are certain he will strike,

36:32.704 --> 36:34.504
and they see treachery
at every turn.

36:34.506 --> 36:37.429
If they see treachery,
then they are looking in a mirror.

36:40.472 --> 36:43.273
We'll have to mend
the cart ourselves.

36:43.275 --> 36:44.915
- Mother!
- We'll get the boys to help.

36:44.917 --> 36:46.756
It'll toughen them up.

36:46.758 --> 36:48.919
Mother!

36:48.921 --> 36:51.603
Her Grace, the Spanish
princess, is here to see you.

36:53.565 --> 36:55.606
Maggie,
do not join her cause.

36:55.608 --> 36:59.610
Your cause is here,
with the children and me.

36:59.612 --> 37:00.611
Down there.

37:11.784 --> 37:13.023
My Lady Pole.

37:13.025 --> 37:15.708
Catherine.
Lady de Cardones.

37:17.790 --> 37:20.751
I have learned you have been
banished from the court,

37:20.753 --> 37:23.074
<i>because you spoke out
for me to Lady Margaret.</i>

37:23.076 --> 37:24.996
I spoke for no one
but myself.

37:24.998 --> 37:28.960
Still, you have suffered
for my benefit.

37:28.962 --> 37:30.121
I wish to make amends.

37:30.123 --> 37:31.963
You can do nothing.

37:31.965 --> 37:34.886
<i>In fact, the rift
has served me well.</i>

37:34.888 --> 37:37.809
Perhaps I should
be thanking you.

37:37.811 --> 37:39.130
We are united

37:39.132 --> 37:41.855
in Margaret Beaufort's
hatred of us both.

37:46.139 --> 37:49.503
May we
take refreshment?

37:55.629 --> 37:57.631
Lady Pole...

37:58.112 --> 38:01.233
I wish to ask you
for your guidance.

38:01.235 --> 38:02.234
Ah.

38:02.236 --> 38:04.676
The king.

38:04.678 --> 38:07.840
He is a decent man.

38:07.842 --> 38:10.645
And he would make you queen.

38:12.567 --> 38:16.168
I want you to tell me what
kind of husband he would be.

38:16.170 --> 38:18.771
You ask me
to petition for a king

38:18.773 --> 38:21.854
whose presence I'm
not seen fit to stand in?

38:21.856 --> 38:23.858
Oh, this family.

38:26.060 --> 38:28.823
You prefer
his son, then?

38:30.065 --> 38:33.666
It was Arthur
I was close to.

38:33.668 --> 38:36.069
But Harry...

38:36.071 --> 38:41.875
he is clever and has a
fevered lust for knowledge.

38:41.877 --> 38:47.240
His appetites flood in all
directions, wise and foolish.

38:47.242 --> 38:49.202
He runs at life,

38:49.204 --> 38:53.887
which means he's not always
constant in his interests.

38:53.889 --> 38:56.169
There is danger in him.

38:56.171 --> 38:59.413
He was not sired
to be king.

38:59.415 --> 39:02.896
He was mollycoddled
by his grandmother.

39:02.898 --> 39:06.860
A man with too much power and
no discipline is dangerous.

39:06.862 --> 39:09.783
I see another
side to him.

39:09.785 --> 39:13.707
He is passionate
and poetic.

39:13.709 --> 39:15.709
He is like
a knight of Camelot...

39:15.711 --> 39:20.597
flawed, but also brave
and dedicated.

39:22.198 --> 39:24.200
Lancelot.

39:25.642 --> 39:29.245
You clearly know your mind
about him, so why ask me?

39:31.087 --> 39:35.770
Catherine, if you wish to be
queen, then take the king.

39:35.772 --> 39:39.814
But I think you rode here not
just to ask for forgiveness,

39:39.816 --> 39:44.099
but to speak
Prince Harry's name aloud.

39:44.101 --> 39:46.263
<i>I think you love Harry.</i>

39:48.225 --> 39:51.188
May God help you
if you do.

39:59.877 --> 40:03.080
<i>Dada, look.
I'm helping.</i>

40:04.842 --> 40:05.841
<i>Ursula.</i>

40:05.843 --> 40:07.242
Go on.

40:07.244 --> 40:08.284
<i>Henry, look.</i>

40:08.286 --> 40:09.925
What did she want?

40:09.927 --> 40:11.927
To ease her heart.

40:11.929 --> 40:15.291
Do you know I've
realized I admire her?

40:15.293 --> 40:18.374
She's brave,
and she's certain she's right.

40:18.376 --> 40:21.938
I wish I'd been more like
her when I was younger.

40:21.940 --> 40:23.819
Maggie.

40:23.821 --> 40:25.942
Whatever my life
has thrown at me,

40:25.944 --> 40:28.865
I'm glad you're
in it, Richard,

40:28.867 --> 40:33.632
that we have each
other, our love.

40:54.293 --> 40:58.215
Lina, do you
think me selfish?

40:58.217 --> 41:01.018
You are trained
to be a queen.

41:01.020 --> 41:05.022
You ask others
to make sacrifices.

41:05.024 --> 41:07.745
It is the way
of kings and queens.

41:07.747 --> 41:10.748
You have been my closest
friend and confidante

41:10.750 --> 41:12.912
since we came
to England.

41:15.154 --> 41:18.356
I cannot think of living
here without you by my side,

41:18.358 --> 41:23.122
but I will not be the cause
of your unhappiness.

41:24.364 --> 41:26.043
You're right.

41:26.045 --> 41:28.806
You've done
too much for me.

41:28.808 --> 41:31.289
And if you wish
to marry Oviedo,

41:31.291 --> 41:33.293
then you will find
support from me.

41:35.015 --> 41:36.214
- I...
- I cannot promise

41:36.216 --> 41:38.496
you will stay
within my household,

41:38.498 --> 41:41.980
as that may not be
within my gift,

41:41.982 --> 41:44.344
but you will have
a dowry from me...

41:46.066 --> 41:47.786
three gold plates.

41:47.788 --> 41:49.588
You may
melt them down,

41:49.590 --> 41:51.950
and that will be
a start, at least,

41:51.952 --> 41:54.873
if you should have
to make your own way.

41:54.875 --> 41:56.877
Thank you.

41:57.478 --> 41:58.917
Thank you, Highness.

41:58.919 --> 42:01.039
Catherine.

42:01.041 --> 42:03.043
We are friends,
I hope.

42:03.964 --> 42:06.405
Yes.

42:06.407 --> 42:11.050
Yes, we are friends.

42:11.052 --> 42:13.172
Sisters.

42:26.307 --> 42:27.306
Lina!

42:27.308 --> 42:30.189
Rosa, what is it?

42:30.191 --> 42:33.074
I am so sorry.

42:35.397 --> 42:37.399
I can't do it.

42:39.401 --> 42:41.803
I can't kill my baby.

42:43.485 --> 42:46.446
I-I'll pay you
for <i>pesario.</i>

42:46.448 --> 42:48.450
Tell me what you paid.

42:51.974 --> 42:54.895
I shame Your Highness.

42:54.897 --> 42:57.497
Please don't let them
flog me.

42:57.499 --> 43:00.422
Rosa is with child,
señora.

43:03.666 --> 43:07.950
Lina,
prepare my bath.

43:27.010 --> 43:30.974
The father
will not marry you?

43:32.535 --> 43:34.976
He...

43:34.978 --> 43:36.578
has a wife.

43:36.580 --> 43:38.700
But I need
to tell him.

43:38.702 --> 43:40.984
I think that he
will help me.

43:45.068 --> 43:48.472
Lina, will you
come with me?

43:56.520 --> 43:58.522
Stay with her.

44:04.048 --> 44:06.050
Infanta, I...

44:14.338 --> 44:17.141
<i>Perdona esta intrusión.</i>

44:19.384 --> 44:21.464
The queen, your mother,

44:21.466 --> 44:23.466
she sends word
to the king.

44:23.468 --> 44:24.987
What does she say?

44:24.989 --> 44:26.991
I think she writes
the same to you.

44:32.437 --> 44:35.078
<i>"Are you to have two husbands?</i>

44:35.080 --> 44:38.281
<i>I received two letters,
each about a different man.</i>

44:38.283 --> 44:40.243
<i>You want to wed Prince Harry.</i>

44:40.245 --> 44:43.326
<i>Then the king writes that he
will take you for himself.</i>

44:43.328 --> 44:46.570
<i>Take the bird in hand
and be grateful at your luck.</i>

44:46.572 --> 44:49.132
<i>You're lucky now
to even make a queen."</i>

44:49.134 --> 44:51.497
You have permission for
your marriage to the king.

44:54.420 --> 44:56.980
<i>"Your sister
can find no luck of her own.</i>

44:58.103 --> 45:00.103
<i>She stayed with me in Spain</i>

45:00.105 --> 45:02.386
<i>for the birth of her child,
but it made her very sick.</i>

45:04.430 --> 45:06.110
<i>None of us
had sleep for months</i>

45:06.112 --> 45:08.312
<i>until she sailed back
to her husband</i>

45:08.314 --> 45:10.554
<i>and took the child with her."</i>

45:10.556 --> 45:13.157
She writes to me
that she is troubled

45:13.159 --> 45:14.358
by your sister,
Lady Joanna.

45:14.360 --> 45:15.800
She helped her
with the baby.

45:15.802 --> 45:17.401
It left her very tired.

45:17.403 --> 45:19.405
Tell me, Ambassador...

45:20.406 --> 45:22.408
whose eyes are these?

45:24.410 --> 45:28.214
Are they the eyes of queen
consort to King Henry?

45:30.136 --> 45:33.099
Please inform the Prince of Wales
that I would like to see him.

45:49.156 --> 45:51.276
I was glad
to get your message.

45:51.278 --> 45:54.639
God has placed
this moment in my lap.

45:54.641 --> 45:57.524
He means
to make me see myself...

45:59.607 --> 46:02.129
and listen to my heart.

46:04.532 --> 46:07.493
He means for us
to be together.

46:10.498 --> 46:12.500
Oh.

46:13.301 --> 46:16.462
But... But what has changed?

46:16.464 --> 46:18.304
Did your mother
refuse my father?

46:18.306 --> 46:20.506
No.

46:20.508 --> 46:22.508
She wrote and
gave permission.

46:22.510 --> 46:24.470
Then how... how are we to...

46:24.472 --> 46:26.474
Trust your God.

46:28.196 --> 46:30.198
And trust in me.

47:00.189 --> 47:02.191
<i>Your Grace.</i>

47:08.557 --> 47:11.679
We received a letter
from your mother.

47:11.681 --> 47:14.484
I am aware of it,
Your Grace.

47:15.685 --> 47:17.807
And do you give consent?

47:19.569 --> 47:21.571
Would I make you happy?

47:22.732 --> 47:26.454
Would I make you as happy
as your wife did?

47:28.218 --> 47:32.380
As you know,
Catherine, I, um...

47:32.382 --> 47:34.622
I loved my wife.

47:34.624 --> 47:36.184
<i>I still do,</i>

47:36.186 --> 47:39.587
<i>but, uh, I would try
to be a husband to you.</i>

47:39.589 --> 47:42.230
I would be respectful
and considerate,

47:42.232 --> 47:47.117
and I would
not bother you too much.

47:48.759 --> 47:50.799
It was her dying wish.

47:50.801 --> 47:54.322
If she knew
you could not love me,

47:54.324 --> 47:56.685
then she did it for the
safety of your country,

47:56.687 --> 47:59.568
<i>for the alliance between
Spain and England.</i>

47:59.570 --> 48:02.493
- Yes.
- But marrying me does not secure that.

48:03.734 --> 48:07.416
In fact,
it does the opposite.

48:07.418 --> 48:10.339
If we wed, our children
won't succeed us.

48:10.341 --> 48:14.303
Of course not.
Harry's will, as Lizzie's son.

48:14.305 --> 48:15.744
The throne belongs to Harry,

48:15.746 --> 48:17.987
then his son,
and then his grandson.

48:17.989 --> 48:20.910
So how long would your
treaty hold with Spain?

48:20.912 --> 48:24.794
Only until, God forbid,

48:24.796 --> 48:28.478
you pass away and
Harry takes the throne.

48:28.480 --> 48:30.640
And then, just when
he needs it the most,

48:30.642 --> 48:32.882
there will be
no protection.

48:32.884 --> 48:35.805
I would be the widow
to his father.

48:35.807 --> 48:37.767
I could not command
my country to his side.

48:37.769 --> 48:41.333
<i>He would be alone
in all of Europe...</i>

48:42.534 --> 48:44.334
and whoever
then rules Spain

48:44.336 --> 48:45.775
would make treaties
with your enemies.

48:45.777 --> 48:48.418
Or else they would renew
their pact with England.

48:48.420 --> 48:50.662
There are many benefits.

48:56.228 --> 48:58.350
You wish to marry Harry.

49:00.953 --> 49:03.313
My wife had many gifts,

49:03.315 --> 49:05.355
and she said
if you married him,

49:05.357 --> 49:07.958
then there
would be no sons.

49:07.960 --> 49:09.920
She saw this.

49:09.922 --> 49:14.287
You don't think your wife saw in
your eyes how lonely you would be?

49:15.688 --> 49:20.651
And in pain for you,
perhaps she was confused.

49:20.653 --> 49:22.453
Because the first time
I met her,

49:22.455 --> 49:24.855
she told me she'd do
anything to save her sons.

49:24.857 --> 49:26.860
She'd kill for them.

49:28.942 --> 49:30.944
Don't take the risk.

49:32.065 --> 49:34.587
Give Harry the alliance.

49:36.349 --> 49:41.234
Keep him safe, for her.

50:23.117 --> 50:24.877
I do not think
this is a good idea.

50:24.879 --> 50:26.599
I know you do not like him.

50:26.601 --> 50:29.764
But he cares for me.
You'll see.

50:35.610 --> 50:36.970
Ah, Lady de Vargas.

50:36.972 --> 50:39.452
Lord Stafford,
I must speak with you.

50:39.454 --> 50:41.054
Well, I'm...

50:41.056 --> 50:45.701
You're not, uh...
not with your mistress?

50:47.583 --> 50:49.585
I am carrying your child.

50:52.588 --> 50:54.788
I know you have a wife,

50:54.790 --> 50:56.750
and I will not
cause you trouble.

50:56.752 --> 50:58.672
I ask for just enough
to live on,

50:58.674 --> 51:00.394
a tiny house
for me and the baby,

51:00.396 --> 51:03.599
that you give us food,
and visit us sometimes.

51:07.523 --> 51:09.805
That sounds
like a good idea.

51:12.648 --> 51:14.650
And I will
make arrangements.

51:30.787 --> 51:33.988
John, do you know
where Oviedo is?

51:33.990 --> 51:35.830
Uh, Richmond.

51:35.832 --> 51:37.552
The king
build new palace.

51:37.554 --> 51:38.793
It must be guarded.

51:38.795 --> 51:40.595
It must be wonderful
to be rich.

51:40.597 --> 51:45.322
I hear they will be back in,
uh, one month or maybe two.

51:52.970 --> 51:55.012
- Wine.
- My Lord.

52:02.219 --> 52:05.743
Lady Catherine
of Aragon and Castile...

52:07.745 --> 52:11.507
I withdraw my proposal
of marriage to you.

52:11.509 --> 52:13.429
You will
instead be betrothed

52:13.431 --> 52:16.472
to my son Henry,
Prince of Wales.

52:16.474 --> 52:19.875
<i>Your heirs will ensure
the continued peace</i>

52:19.877 --> 52:21.677
<i>between our two kingdoms.</i>

52:21.679 --> 52:23.519
Thank you, Father.

52:23.521 --> 52:25.924
- Henry...
- I will send my letter to the pope...

52:27.525 --> 52:29.045
requesting
his dispensation.

52:29.047 --> 52:30.486
Thank you, Your Grace.

52:30.488 --> 52:34.052
If he grants it,
you may be married...

52:36.174 --> 52:43.382
only when your mother
sends the dowry.

52:47.626 --> 52:50.749
Your future
hangs upon Castile.

53:03.762 --> 53:05.602
<i>You look busy, Father.</i>

53:05.604 --> 53:07.564
This one doesn't look
too good, either.

53:07.566 --> 53:08.726
I'm gonna need
to replace it.

53:08.728 --> 53:09.727
Father, can I help?

53:11.010 --> 53:13.010
Ah, you can get me
the axle grease.

53:14.534 --> 53:16.536
Ah, good. Then I
can get a drink.

53:17.937 --> 53:19.056
Come on, Ursula.

53:19.058 --> 53:20.538
Come and help me
with the supper.

53:20.540 --> 53:21.939
Yes, Mother.

53:21.941 --> 53:23.140
Come on,
little help.

53:23.142 --> 53:26.023
How 'bout I take you
in with me?

53:26.025 --> 53:27.585
Where is it...
Ah, there it is.

53:27.587 --> 53:29.587
We've got meat pies
for supper.

53:29.589 --> 53:31.591
<i>Ah, behave.</i>

53:33.193 --> 53:35.914
Can you help
with supper, too?

53:35.916 --> 53:37.755
<i>Reggie, careful!</i>

54:00.981 --> 54:03.702
Henry, Henry,
come and help me!

54:03.704 --> 54:05.706
Help me.

54:06.667 --> 54:09.068
Father!

54:09.070 --> 54:11.150
<i>Mother!</i>

54:11.152 --> 54:13.714
Get the jack!
Get the jack, Henry!

54:16.677 --> 54:18.357
It's all right, Richard.

54:19.560 --> 54:20.800
<i>We'll get it off.</i>

54:23.244 --> 54:25.725
<i>We're almost there,
Richard.</i>

54:25.727 --> 54:27.729
<i>Quickly! That's it.</i>

54:30.371 --> 54:32.654
Reggie, Ursula,
go inside.

54:33.975 --> 54:35.134
<i>Father.</i>

54:38.179 --> 54:42.742
Oh, please, Richard,
please, don't leave me.

54:42.744 --> 54:45.147
I can't do this
without you.

54:48.670 --> 54:51.311
I love you.
