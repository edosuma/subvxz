01:18.620 --> 01:20.407
I just don't know
if I can do this.

01:20.622 --> 01:21.622
You can do it.

01:21.832 --> 01:22.832
We can do it.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.077
What if he finds us?

01:25.043 --> 01:26.204
I can protect you.

01:27.170 --> 01:28.581
Look, you need to trust me.

01:29.506 --> 01:31.623
You deserve to be
with someone who loves you.

01:32.175 --> 01:33.632
Not someone who controls you.

01:39.975 --> 01:42.012
Okay, come on,
we need to hurry.

01:42.227 --> 01:43.227
(BANGING ON DOOR)

01:43.353 --> 01:44.514
MAN: Katja!

01:47.941 --> 01:50.183
Alexander.
This isn't what it looks like...

01:50.402 --> 01:51.688
(GASPS)

01:55.032 --> 01:56.193
You betrayed me.

01:56.408 --> 01:58.650
I will deal with you later.

02:03.206 --> 02:04.206
And this...

02:05.208 --> 02:07.871
This is the object of your affection.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.793
Frankly, I don't see it.

02:13.008 --> 02:14.340
(GUN COCKS)

02:15.510 --> 02:16.510
Don't do this, Zogu.

02:17.721 --> 02:18.962
Any last words?

02:20.182 --> 02:21.182
Yeah. (CLEARS THROAT)

02:21.391 --> 02:22.391
Pineapple.

02:23.477 --> 02:24.477
"Pineapple"?

02:27.064 --> 02:28.100
What is this "pineapple"?

02:28.732 --> 02:29.973
It's a delicious fruit.

02:30.192 --> 02:31.854
I know it's delicious...

02:32.069 --> 02:34.061
You are an imbecile,
you know that?

02:34.279 --> 02:36.236
I grant you your last words

02:36.448 --> 02:39.612
and you give me
pineapple nonsense.

02:39.826 --> 02:40.826
What is this?

02:40.911 --> 02:42.031
Well, pineapple, it's the...

02:42.079 --> 02:43.079
(SIGHS)

02:43.538 --> 02:45.325
It's the code word
for the raid order.

(SWAT OFFICERS SHOUTING)

02:49.586 --> 02:50.702

02:51.630 --> 02:52.670
Don't even think about it.

02:58.261 --> 02:59.261
FBI.

02:59.304 --> 03:00.465
You're under arrest, Zogu.

03:00.681 --> 03:03.298
Racketeering, wire fraud,
money laundering,

03:03.517 --> 03:05.237
and I'm sure we'll think up
some other stuff

03:05.268 --> 03:07.726
like trying to kill me
and slapping women around.

03:07.938 --> 03:09.349
And extremely bad cologne.

03:10.482 --> 03:12.724
This is only the beginning,
my friend.

03:12.943 --> 03:14.229
I'm not your friend.

03:14.444 --> 03:15.444
Get him out of here.

03:25.539 --> 03:26.539
You're FBI?

03:27.541 --> 03:28.541
I'm sorry.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.058
(SIGHS)

03:47.269 --> 03:48.851
Pineapple?

03:49.062 --> 03:50.790
Couldn't think of something better
than pineapple?

03:50.814 --> 03:52.271
(LAUGHING)

03:52.482 --> 03:54.974
You know I love pineapple, man.
It's my favorite fruit.

03:56.653 --> 03:58.315
Dude, you look like
you need a drink.

03:58.530 --> 03:59.924
It's on me. Come on,
let's get out of here.

03:59.948 --> 04:01.905
Let's go.
Let's get out of here.

04:02.117 --> 04:04.109
Come on, man,
you did good in here.

04:04.327 --> 04:06.614
You like the way I bust in the door?
Wasn't it gangster?

05:56.815 --> 05:58.977
How was your date last night?

05:59.192 --> 06:01.730
It wasn't a date, grandpa.
No one dates anymore.

06:01.945 --> 06:02.945
It was a hookup.

06:03.071 --> 06:04.215
SANDERS:
Oh, it was a booty call.

06:04.239 --> 06:06.105
You know, I've got a theory,
you wanna hear it?

06:06.324 --> 06:07.324
No.

06:07.409 --> 06:08.409
Hello.

06:08.493 --> 06:09.950
Hello.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.452
Hey, you know, you haven't been in

06:12.664 --> 06:14.747
any serious relationship since Katja.

06:14.958 --> 06:16.665
I think
you're still in love with her.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.290
Excuse me, I was never in love
with Katja. I was undercover.

06:19.504 --> 06:20.504
I was acting.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.751
Oh. Okay, you were acting.

06:22.966 --> 06:24.332
Well, you know, sometimes,

06:24.551 --> 06:27.009
these kind of assignments
can blur the lines, Romeo.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.711
Why're you busting my chops?

06:28.930 --> 06:30.091
Trial's next week.

06:30.307 --> 06:32.094
Katja's gonna be there to testify.

06:32.309 --> 06:34.266
You're not a little excited
to see her?

06:34.477 --> 06:36.309
And what?
Settle down with Zogu's mistress

06:36.521 --> 06:38.808
in the witness protection program?

06:39.065 --> 06:41.148

for the rest of my life?

06:41.359 --> 06:42.359
No, thanks, I'm good.

That is perfect karma.

06:54.331 --> 06:56.971
The vending machine gods want you
to be honest about your feelings.

06:58.543 --> 07:00.103
Calm down.
I'll give you another dollar.

07:00.295 --> 07:03.003
That's not the point. This machine
owes me a goddamn Twix bar.

- MAN: Agent Reed!

07:09.429 --> 07:11.170
What are you doing?

07:12.182 --> 07:13.826
Were you about to shoot
that vending machine?

07:13.850 --> 07:15.762
No, of course not.

07:15.977 --> 07:17.718
That's good to hear.

07:18.146 --> 07:21.435
Because that's something
only a crazy person would do.

07:23.026 --> 07:24.562
A crazy person

07:24.778 --> 07:26.269
without a job. (WHISPERS)

07:35.789 --> 07:39.032
arrested following a car crash
where your brother Kevin died, huh?

07:39.668 --> 07:40.668
What am I doing here?

07:40.752 --> 07:44.166
What does the FBI care
about a stupid traffic accident?

07:44.381 --> 07:47.624
REED: Valmir Krasniqi
and Sokol Pula,

07:47.842 --> 07:50.550
lieutenants
in the Zogu crime syndicate.

07:50.762 --> 07:51.822
JASON: Never heard of them.

07:51.846 --> 07:53.132
Well, they've heard of you.

07:53.348 --> 07:55.385
I got 20 different
traffic cams telling me

07:55.600 --> 07:56.827
they were following you that day.

07:56.851 --> 07:59.309
Maybe they wanted
to borrow some Grey Poupon.

08:00.063 --> 08:01.063
Let's cut him loose.

08:02.691 --> 08:04.683
Yeah, yeah,
we made a mistake.

08:04.901 --> 08:05.937
You sure about that?

08:06.152 --> 08:08.064
He doesn't know anything
about the Albanians.

08:08.279 --> 08:10.111
We'll just keep an eye on him

08:10.323 --> 08:15.034
and when Zogu kills him for stealing
his Wi-Fi or whatever he did,

08:15.245 --> 08:17.032
maybe we'll get lucky
with the forensics.

08:17.247 --> 08:18.247
Fair enough.

08:18.331 --> 08:19.822
I say we get his dental records

08:20.041 --> 08:22.875
'cause Albanians
always burn the body.

08:23.461 --> 08:24.741
I'll have O'Connell take a mold.

08:24.879 --> 08:25.879
Hold on, wait!

08:26.089 --> 08:27.921
Okay! Okay!

08:28.466 --> 08:29.877
I know Zogu.

08:30.260 --> 08:33.298
Well, I know of him. I tried
selling him some merchandise.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.727
Doesn't it feel good
to get that off your chest?

08:35.974 --> 08:37.214
So, what'd you try to sell him?

08:37.517 --> 08:41.010
Drugs? Guns? Plutonium?

08:41.229 --> 08:42.345
No.

08:42.563 --> 08:44.054
No, nothing like that. No.

08:44.274 --> 08:47.438
I tried selling him
some information.

08:48.278 --> 08:50.520
He didn't meet my price,
so I...

08:51.239 --> 08:52.480
You what?

08:53.450 --> 08:55.487
I tried selling
to Victor Popov instead.

08:55.702 --> 08:56.783
(LAUGHING)

08:57.787 --> 08:58.994
Oh, now I understand.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.741
This guy's a genius.

09:00.957 --> 09:02.877
We just want to know
what you tried to sell Zogu.

09:05.295 --> 09:06.911
Let's make a deal.

09:07.130 --> 09:08.570
We can put you
in witness protection.

Give me a break.

09:17.557 --> 09:18.673
Maybe.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.328
If you want to know if I'm telling
the truth, it's gonna cost you.

09:21.352 --> 09:22.513
We ain't paying you shit.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.686
I want full immunity.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.898

Isn't it just a rolling blackout?

Ten, maybe 12.

09:57.514 --> 09:58.514
Ah. Easy.

Can I have an M&M's?

12:18.655 --> 12:20.735
So, you just gonna keep the Twix
and not give me any?

12:20.865 --> 12:22.982
Oh. All right, all right.
I'll remember that.

12:24.118 --> 12:26.280
A fresh one, too?
Thank you, man.

12:29.499 --> 12:32.867
GIARDELLO: We have three unidentified
Eastern Europeans in critical condition,

and those two Albanians
you maimed

12:38.341 --> 12:40.101
but they know talking to us
would be suicide.

And Jason?

12:41.594 --> 12:43.085
to federal detention center
at SeaTac.

12:43.304 --> 12:44.904
So, you believe
that loser hacked his way

12:44.931 --> 12:46.467
into the witness
protection database?

12:46.683 --> 12:47.764
It's impossible.

12:47.976 --> 12:50.468
First of all, it's a 128-bit cypher
with parallel encryption...

12:50.687 --> 12:51.803
(SHUSHING)

12:53.356 --> 12:54.972
The director of technology
confirmed

12:55.191 --> 12:56.932
the database
was breached last month.

12:57.151 --> 12:58.892
We're fried.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.899
They're after Katja.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.231
Well, let's move her.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.031
But it's not that simple.

13:05.243 --> 13:08.111
This particular database not only had
the witnesses' locations,

13:08.329 --> 13:09.865
it had their new identifications,

13:10.081 --> 13:11.822
photos, social security numbers.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.681
He'd find her no matter
where we move her.

13:13.751 --> 13:14.979
You catching what I'm pitching?

13:15.003 --> 13:16.683
Well, let's get that list
before Zogu does.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.076
There's good news on that front.

13:18.214 --> 13:19.330
As part of his plea deal,

13:19.549 --> 13:22.212
Jason told us he only made
one copy of the database

13:22.427 --> 13:25.716
which is on a flash drive he gave
to his brother for safekeeping.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.157
He didn't upload it to the cloud?

13:27.181 --> 13:30.515
He said he didn't,
but we'll find out if he's lying.

13:30.893 --> 13:32.304
We're executing search warrants

13:32.520 --> 13:34.227
at his brother's apartment
and his school.

13:34.439 --> 13:35.439
His school?

13:35.481 --> 13:38.519
Kevin Flaherty was a kindergarten
teacher at Hunts Bay Academy.

13:38.735 --> 13:40.442
Wow. Impressive.

13:40.653 --> 13:41.653
Impressive.

13:41.738 --> 13:42.738
What's Hunts Bay?

13:42.905 --> 13:45.568
It's only the most prestigious
elementary private school

13:45.783 --> 13:46.783
in the city.

13:46.784 --> 13:48.776
It's like $50,000 a year
to go there.

13:48.995 --> 13:49.995
$50,000.

13:50.621 --> 13:51.621
For kindergarten?

13:51.748 --> 13:52.909
Count it.

13:53.124 --> 13:55.537
All right. You take the school.
I'll take the apartment.

13:55.752 --> 13:56.752
Let's do it.

13:56.836 --> 13:57.836
Reed!

14:03.926 --> 14:05.667
Get me that drive!

We've been working on a pretrial

14:37.001 --> 14:38.537
while you've been out on bail

14:38.753 --> 14:41.291
and the U.S. Attorney
is finally making us an offer.

14:41.506 --> 14:44.294
To be quite honest,
it looks pretty fair.

14:44.550 --> 14:47.384
Our advice to you
is to take the deal.

14:48.471 --> 14:49.471
No.

14:49.597 --> 14:50.597
No prison time.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.764
But the testimony from Katja
is going to sink us.

14:56.562 --> 14:57.562
If she testifies.

14:58.815 --> 14:59.815
We didn't hear that.

SANDERS: (ON PHONE) Well, I'm finishing up
at the school.

15:16.874 --> 15:19.491
There's nothing in the classroom
as far as I can tell.

15:19.710 --> 15:20.826
Well,
maybe Jason was lying.

15:21.045 --> 15:23.628
Maybe he uploaded the files
and destroyed the physical copies.

15:23.840 --> 15:26.068
We've got both brothers' computers,
going through them now.

15:26.092 --> 15:27.092

15:27.176 --> 15:29.008
We're just gonna give up,
hope for the best?

15:29.220 --> 15:30.961
Hey, you got
any better ideas, Einstein?

15:31.180 --> 15:32.261
Yeah.

15:32.473 --> 15:33.839
I want to talk to Jason again.

15:34.058 --> 15:35.390
You already did.

15:35.601 --> 15:36.921
Well,
give me another shot at him.

Kevin hid the drive somewhere.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.745
He didn't tell me where.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.826
That was kind of the whole point.

16:03.045 --> 16:04.081
Think.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.630
Did he say anything else?

16:06.841 --> 16:08.481
SANDERS:
What about in the car that night?

16:08.593 --> 16:11.210
Did he say anything
before he died?

16:14.015 --> 16:15.597
He was babbling.

16:16.058 --> 16:17.640
Not making sense.

16:19.145 --> 16:22.764
Why should I help the FBI
and all its shadow organizations out?

16:22.982 --> 16:25.975
Face it,
you guys are irrelevant at best

16:26.194 --> 16:27.901
and unconstitutional at worst.

16:28.112 --> 16:30.399
Look, a lot of people
are going to get hurt

16:30.615 --> 16:32.572
if Zogu finds that list
before we do.

16:33.075 --> 16:34.316
A lot of innocent people.

16:34.535 --> 16:35.535
Did he say anything?

16:35.745 --> 16:38.158
It doesn't matter
if it doesn't make sense.

16:40.583 --> 16:43.496
He said, "The kids know."

"The kids know."

16:55.598 --> 16:56.998
REED:
We got to question those kids.

16:57.099 --> 16:58.806
So you want to bring
a bunch of 6-year-olds

16:59.018 --> 17:00.134
into an interrogation room?

17:00.353 --> 17:01.434
If that's what it takes.

17:01.646 --> 17:04.262
Reed, I promise you,
you probably aren't aware of this

17:04.482 --> 17:06.018
since the only people
you interact with

17:06.233 --> 17:07.314
are 19-year-old mattresses.

17:07.401 --> 17:08.608
What's a mattress?

17:08.819 --> 17:10.151
Model/actress.

17:10.404 --> 17:12.111
Ah. That's fair.

17:12.323 --> 17:13.984
Five-year-olds, 6-year-olds,

17:14.200 --> 17:16.567
they are totally useless
for reliable information.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.578
Look,

17:20.790 --> 17:22.702

17:23.752 --> 17:24.938
that can save those witnesses,

then let's put the mac
and cheese on the stove

in the ground.

My dad lets me play video games
whenever I want to when I'm at his house

18:00.538 --> 18:03.781
and he's having a special time
with his girlfriend

18:04.000 --> 18:09.337
but mommy says video games rot the brain
and daddy's girlfriend is a bad influence

18:09.547 --> 18:12.164
because she dances
on poles for a living.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.089
Guys, can we get a kid in here

about a flash drive?

19:05.770 --> 19:07.056
You did?

19:07.396 --> 19:09.763
Did you see where Mr. Flaherty
put the flash drive?

19:09.982 --> 19:12.019
In the emergency kit.

19:26.707 --> 19:28.664
All right, Sophie,
show me the flash drive.

19:28.876 --> 19:31.744
There it is.
There's the flash drive.

19:33.255 --> 19:34.996
This is a flashlight.

19:37.718 --> 19:38.718

It's not going to happen,
not in a million years.

19:54.777 --> 19:56.313
That's why we have
to go undercover

19:56.529 --> 19:57.815
without telling the headmaster.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.942
But she already
knows Sanders is FBI.

Now, we have our own

and her dads are still in San Juan

22:55.291 --> 22:56.451
What is wrong with you, Reed?

22:56.625 --> 22:58.742
All you gotta do
is just wear the earpiece.

if you get into trouble.

with patches on your jacket.

23:26.488 --> 23:27.488
Look at that.

23:27.573 --> 23:29.109
You're a mess, man.

23:29.325 --> 23:31.112
You sure you don't want
the earpiece?

23:31.327 --> 23:32.327
Can I go now?

23:32.453 --> 23:33.763
You can't even help white people.

23:33.787 --> 23:35.387
You try to help,
you give from the heart.

is taking away our rights.

26:30.422 --> 26:31.422
Okay, good.

26:31.548 --> 26:34.962
Now, did Mr. Flaherty
ever show you one of these before?

26:37.554 --> 26:39.637
- Yes.
- Our ginea pig's name is Meeja.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.516

Okay.

26:45.187 --> 26:46.187
Good to know.

26:46.230 --> 26:47.670
But we're talking
about flash drives.

26:47.815 --> 26:54.608
We wanted to name her Shahbo Beebo but
Mr. Flaherty already said her name was Meeja

26:54.822 --> 26:57.735
and if we called her a different name,
she'll get confused

26:57.950 --> 27:00.158
and sometimes
she like makes very big poop.

we wrote about Meeja?

27:07.709 --> 27:08.709
Not really. No.

27:08.919 --> 27:11.252
- The guinea pig Meeja...
- Is a rodent and...

27:11.463 --> 27:12.795
Meeja is her name.

No, actually,
it's technology day,

flash drive time.

sharing is overrated.

28:37.549 --> 28:41.259
If you have something special,
you don't need to share it or hide it

28:41.470 --> 28:44.884
or feel sorry for the other losers
that aren't as talented as you are.

28:45.098 --> 28:47.090
Never apologize for abilities

52:57.257 --> 52:59.465
Sunflower.

52:59.677 --> 53:02.385
- Uh-huh.
- It's beautiful.

53:02.596 --> 53:04.713
My name is Agent Zack Reed.

53:04.932 --> 53:05.932
FBI.

53:07.184 --> 53:08.424
Could I speak with you
a moment?

53:08.602 --> 53:10.514
You don't sound like FBI.

53:11.313 --> 53:14.101
International FBI,
it's new division.

53:19.613 --> 53:20.613
(PIG GRUNTING)

53:27.496 --> 53:28.496
Oh, no, not the pig.

53:28.664 --> 53:30.530
Pig, get lost.

53:31.458 --> 53:32.458
(GRUNTING)

53:37.047 --> 53:38.254
Lose the pig.

53:38.841 --> 53:41.299
Hey, pig,
stop following me.

53:49.685 --> 53:52.165
Look in those drawers, it could be
hidden right in plain sight.

53:58.736 --> 54:00.193
SANDERS: Look in the desk.

54:01.321 --> 54:02.562
REED: Ah. Great.

54:04.992 --> 54:05.992
(PIG GRUNTING)

54:08.537 --> 54:11.746
Hey, come on, pig. I'm telling you,
I don't need therapy.

54:11.957 --> 54:13.157
Are you sure
about that, buddy?

54:14.626 --> 54:19.121
Could you tell me
anything more about Jason?

54:19.339 --> 54:21.797
Oh, I can tell you he was
always getting into trouble.

54:23.802 --> 54:26.419
His brother, different story.

54:28.432 --> 54:30.014
His brother?

54:30.642 --> 54:31.642
Kevin.

54:32.770 --> 54:35.513
He died in a car accident.

54:35.731 --> 54:38.223
But let me tell you,
he was smart.

54:38.984 --> 54:40.065
He was so smart.

54:40.277 --> 54:42.269
He knew everything
about computers.

54:43.280 --> 54:46.114
I thought Jason was computer expert
in the family?

54:46.325 --> 54:47.691
Oh, no, no, no.

54:49.077 --> 54:51.319
(LAUGHS) Jason has always
been a little con man.

54:52.164 --> 54:53.746
Always looking for the angles.

54:53.957 --> 54:57.166
Kevin, he was the genius.

54:58.045 --> 54:59.206
I see.

55:01.381 --> 55:03.543
I'm sure you were
very proud of him.

55:04.301 --> 55:06.293
Have a good day.

55:08.055 --> 55:09.512
Oh. (SNAPS FINGERS)

55:12.392 --> 55:14.224
Did Kevin have any friends?

55:15.521 --> 55:16.762
Any co-workers?

55:19.691 --> 55:21.057
Hey, get out of here already.

55:21.610 --> 55:22.851
Excuse me?

55:23.070 --> 55:24.186
Oh, crap.

55:24.404 --> 55:26.566
- Oh.
- This is my office.

55:27.074 --> 55:28.531
Oh, hey, hey.
There you are.

55:28.742 --> 55:30.028
Keep the drawer shut, Reed.

55:30.244 --> 55:32.736
What are you doing in here?

55:33.413 --> 55:37.498
- I was looking for you.
- I was in the teacher's lounge.

55:37.709 --> 55:38.709
What did you want?

55:39.336 --> 55:40.336
I...

55:41.255 --> 55:42.089
Excuse me?

55:42.090 --> 55:43.830
What were you
looking for me for?

55:45.008 --> 55:46.965
Yeah, I wanted to, um...

55:47.803 --> 55:49.169
Go ahead, Reed,
ask her out.

55:49.763 --> 55:51.925
Ask her out, I know you're gonna
do it, ask her out.

55:52.140 --> 55:53.551
(LAUGHS)

55:53.767 --> 55:55.508
I wanted to ask you out.

55:55.727 --> 55:57.013
Like on a date?

55:57.229 --> 55:58.229
Uh-huh.

55:58.689 --> 56:00.396
Oh. (CHUCKLES)

56:00.607 --> 56:01.607
Okay.

56:02.359 --> 56:03.359
When?

56:04.236 --> 56:06.649
- When what?
- When would you like to take me out?

56:07.573 --> 56:10.441
Well, what about tonight?

56:11.994 --> 56:15.613
- That's very quick.
- OK, or some other time.

56:15.831 --> 56:17.117
No, no, no.

56:18.458 --> 56:20.812
I know I should probably say that
I already have plans tonight

56:20.836 --> 56:24.955
but to be honest, I haven't had plans
outside of this place in months.

56:25.173 --> 56:26.254
(CHUCKLES)

56:26.466 --> 56:29.254
I shouldn't have said that.
Um, yes, tonight works great.

56:29.469 --> 56:31.131
Another one bites the dust.

56:32.306 --> 56:34.138
Okay. Yeah.

56:37.227 --> 56:39.093
- My office.
- Oh yeah, right.

56:44.776 --> 56:47.063
Call you later?

56:52.075 --> 56:54.818
What do women see in you?
Is it the muscles?

56:55.829 --> 56:57.741
Hey, hey, you.

56:58.332 --> 56:59.332
Uh...

57:00.167 --> 57:02.955
- Talking to Olivia?
- Uh, what?

57:03.962 --> 57:05.624
- Yeah.
- OK, right.

57:05.839 --> 57:08.206
So that's what I wanted
to talk to you about. Uh...

57:08.425 --> 57:11.418
Just a heads-up, but, uh...

57:12.804 --> 57:14.511
I called dibs on her.

57:14.723 --> 57:15.723
You did what now?

57:16.224 --> 57:19.092
I called dibs, you know,
I asked her out first.

57:19.311 --> 57:20.788
I mean, she said
she's not dating right now

57:20.812 --> 57:22.849
but when she started
to date again,

57:23.065 --> 57:26.809
I, me,
would be the first to know.

57:27.277 --> 57:30.270
Ergo, dibs.

57:30.489 --> 57:31.525
Dude, you dreaming.

57:31.740 --> 57:32.740
Okay.

57:32.866 --> 57:35.825
Just so you know.
Man to man.

57:36.036 --> 57:38.119
I don't want there to be
any misunderstandings.

57:38.330 --> 57:39.571
I'm taking her out tonight.

57:39.790 --> 57:41.747
(GROANS WEAKLY)

57:43.543 --> 57:44.543
(CRACKING)

57:50.342 --> 57:52.629
All right.
I'm sorry, on a...

57:54.930 --> 57:56.512
Date?

58:00.978 --> 58:02.389
But I called dibs.

58:02.604 --> 58:03.604
That's impossible.

58:03.772 --> 58:05.652
You're on the geek squad,
it's never gonna work.

58:05.691 --> 58:08.354
Yeah. I didn't know.
I'm sorry, buddy.

58:08.568 --> 58:09.808
I hope we can still be friends.

58:10.529 --> 58:11.940
That's got to hurt.

58:13.031 --> 58:14.351
I could tell that hurt,
that hurt.

58:15.993 --> 58:16.993
(PIG GRUNTING)

58:17.744 --> 58:20.953
Hey. Go help that guy.
He needs therapy.

58:23.959 --> 58:24.959
(BELL RINGING)

58:25.085 --> 58:28.169
Dad, slow down,
you're hurting my arm.

58:28.380 --> 58:31.123
Molly, I don't have time
for this, okay?

58:31.341 --> 58:33.461
MOLLY'S DAD: We got to get home,
stop doing that, okay?

58:34.052 --> 58:35.884
Hi. Hi, I'm Mr. Reed.

58:36.847 --> 58:39.715
- We got to get going.
- You need some help, Molly?

58:40.058 --> 58:41.424
Hey, we're fine.

58:48.525 --> 58:50.608
What're you up to,
Agent Reed?

58:52.612 --> 58:53.612
(EXHALES)

58:55.824 --> 58:58.658
Let's go,
come on, flash drives.

59:00.495 --> 59:01.702
(GROANS)

59:03.707 --> 59:04.868
Hey, Reed,

59:05.083 --> 59:07.370
what was going on with
that one dad after school?

59:07.627 --> 59:08.708
Sam Edwards?

59:09.296 --> 59:11.333
The surveillance program
was still running.

59:12.799 --> 59:17.419
Yeah, he was drunk and I don't like
the way he manhandled his daughter.

59:19.139 --> 59:20.721
Molly's been acting weird.

59:22.934 --> 59:26.302
See what you can find out
about him.

59:26.521 --> 59:28.888
Now we can talk
about the real issue.

59:29.107 --> 59:30.814
No, it's the date.

59:31.818 --> 59:33.650
You know you can't
sleep with her, right?

59:34.571 --> 59:36.938
Look, the kid said
that Kevin used to go into her room

59:37.157 --> 59:38.898
every time
he needed a new drive.

59:39.743 --> 59:41.200
And that super useful information

59:41.411 --> 59:42.777
just wasted 40 minutes of my life.

59:42.996 --> 59:44.362
Her classroom is next door.

59:44.581 --> 59:46.789
Even if the kid's intel is bogus,

59:47.000 --> 59:48.640
she still may know
where he hid the drive.

59:48.668 --> 59:50.660
I'm just checking up a lead.

59:50.879 --> 59:52.791
Oh, so this is purely professional?

59:53.006 --> 59:54.006
Of course.

59:54.216 --> 59:56.016
When was the last time
you went out on a date?

59:56.176 --> 59:58.384
I date all the time.

59:58.595 --> 01:00:01.178
Dinner, romantic lighting,
talking.

01:00:02.265 --> 01:00:03.551
Ooh.

01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:04.767
I got to do all that?

01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:06.763
Yeah, dates are for getting
to know someone.

01:00:06.978 --> 01:00:08.640
I'm messing with you, man.

01:00:08.855 --> 01:00:11.393
I've got a great wholesome
evening lined up for us.

01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:15.272
'Cause that's how Zack Reed,
kindergarten teacher, rolls.

01:00:16.905 --> 01:00:18.567
- Catch you.
- Did you just...

01:00:20.158 --> 01:00:22.115
Hey,
keep your shark in the tank.

01:00:22.327 --> 01:00:23.659
Don't sleep with her.

01:00:29.251 --> 01:00:30.537
Oh, man.

01:00:31.211 --> 01:00:34.295
It is absolutely amazing
out here, Zack.

01:00:35.423 --> 01:00:37.380
How do you afford
this location though?

01:00:39.344 --> 01:00:40.801
My dad left it to me.

01:00:41.721 --> 01:00:43.838
I got to say,
I was kind of surprised

01:00:44.057 --> 01:00:45.468
that you asked me
to have dinner.

01:00:46.434 --> 01:00:47.550
Most guys that I date now,

01:00:47.769 --> 01:00:49.609
they just want to meet
for drinks and have sex.

01:00:50.188 --> 01:00:51.188
Great.

01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:54.478
Now you tell me, after I went
through all this trouble?

01:00:54.693 --> 01:00:55.900
(BOTH LAUGHING)

01:00:58.446 --> 01:01:00.312
Call me old-fashioned, but...

01:01:00.907 --> 01:01:03.524
I think dates are for getting
to know someone.

01:01:04.578 --> 01:01:08.367
Yeah, I agree.
I just, I didn't think...

01:01:09.624 --> 01:01:14.289
You don't exactly seem like the type
of guy who gets to know women.

01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:17.747
Your muscles, they scream
one-night stand, I'm sorry.

01:01:18.758 --> 01:01:19.758
What?

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:22.422
I am incredibly monogamous.

01:01:22.637 --> 01:01:24.674
(LAUGHS) Are you?

01:01:26.308 --> 01:01:27.424
(MUSIC PLAYING)

01:01:29.269 --> 01:01:30.269
Oh, wow.

01:01:30.729 --> 01:01:31.970
You are old school.

01:01:32.731 --> 01:01:34.267
I like vinyl.

01:01:35.817 --> 01:01:37.934
No, look, I would never
just meet a woman

01:01:38.153 --> 01:01:41.362
for drinks, hook up
and never call her again.

01:01:43.241 --> 01:01:46.029
Okay, my mistake.

01:01:48.079 --> 01:01:49.786
(EXHALES)
Well, look, I just got out of

01:01:49.998 --> 01:01:51.705
a serious relationship
about a year ago

01:01:51.917 --> 01:01:55.536
and I've been casually dating a few
women here and there since then.

01:01:56.504 --> 01:02:00.373
But I'm here with you now and
I really do want to get to know you.

01:02:01.051 --> 01:02:02.051
(CHUCKLES)

01:02:02.802 --> 01:02:03.802
Okay.

01:02:04.804 --> 01:02:06.090
What do you want to know?

01:02:10.352 --> 01:02:12.014
I actually went to law school.

01:02:13.855 --> 01:02:15.938
I wanted to be a prosecutor.

01:02:17.525 --> 01:02:20.893
Then I realized
that classrooms and me didn't mix.

01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:23.612
I left after my first year.

01:02:24.032 --> 01:02:25.523
I was a bit...

01:02:26.326 --> 01:02:27.612
Lost for a while.

01:02:29.329 --> 01:02:32.493
I still wanted to do something,
something that mattered.

01:02:34.668 --> 01:02:35.704
I just didn't know what.

01:02:35.919 --> 01:02:38.502
And now here you are,
back in the classroom.

01:02:39.005 --> 01:02:40.005
(CHUCKLES)

01:02:41.341 --> 01:02:43.003
Those who can't do,
teach, right?

01:02:43.218 --> 01:02:44.254
(CHUCKLES)

01:02:45.136 --> 01:02:46.752
But kindergarten?

01:02:48.014 --> 01:02:51.553
It's so rare to find a man who is
interested in children that age.

01:02:54.062 --> 01:02:56.600
Well, make a better impression
if you get them early.

01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:58.271
Yeah.

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:01.601
But it kind of makes it harder too.

01:03:03.113 --> 01:03:05.526
I mean, you only get them
for the one year,

01:03:06.992 --> 01:03:08.872
and you make that
personal connection with them,

01:03:09.035 --> 01:03:11.493
like they're your own kids, kinda.

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:14.617
And then they leave you
for first grade

01:03:14.833 --> 01:03:16.665
and forget all about you.

01:03:17.419 --> 01:03:18.419
(CHUCKLES)

01:03:19.879 --> 01:03:21.461
- Brats.
- Right?

01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:27.009
No, but you get to see them still,
at the school

01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:31.088
and it's so cool
to watch them grow up.

01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:34.679
ZOGU: I like the trailer.

01:03:34.894 --> 01:03:36.010
Ah.

01:03:36.229 --> 01:03:37.811
MAN: I like the car.

01:03:41.443 --> 01:03:42.775
I like the girl.

01:03:45.238 --> 01:03:46.238
Eh...

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:48.526
Too skinny for me.

01:03:48.742 --> 01:03:49.742
(SCOFFS)

01:03:51.202 --> 01:03:52.659
Looks like she doesn't cook.

01:03:52.871 --> 01:03:54.112
(GRUNTS)

01:03:55.123 --> 01:03:57.160
So how well
did you know Kevin?

01:03:57.584 --> 01:03:58.584
Kevin?

01:03:59.586 --> 01:04:00.827
Uh...

01:04:01.046 --> 01:04:04.210
Pretty well, I mean, he was
right next door for three years...

01:04:04.424 --> 01:04:07.417
Did he ever act weird,
like before he died?

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:09.922
What do you mean?

01:04:10.138 --> 01:04:12.755
Did he ever ask you
to keep stuff for him?

01:04:14.059 --> 01:04:15.721
Zack, what are you talking about?

Okay, this is getting
officially really weird.

01:04:30.075 --> 01:04:32.943
Why are you so interested
in Kevin all the time?

01:04:33.161 --> 01:04:35.904
You know, if I know Kevin better,
I could know the kids.

01:04:37.665 --> 01:04:38.872
Okay...

01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:42.664
Kevin was really sweet.

01:04:43.421 --> 01:04:44.787
We were friends.

01:04:45.006 --> 01:04:47.419
And he never gave me
any unmarked packages

01:04:47.634 --> 01:04:49.375
or secret brown envelopes.

01:04:50.261 --> 01:04:51.923
And he died
in a tragic car accident,

01:04:52.138 --> 01:04:53.674
and not in some spy movie.

01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:57.008

we just had
a huge dessert, Zack.

01:05:09.989 --> 01:05:14.654
I know, it's kind of weird.
It's sort of my thing.

And my one vice.

01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:22.074
How do you stay in such good shape
if you eat so much sugar?

01:05:26.089 --> 01:05:28.046
You think
I'm in good shape, huh?

01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:31.510
Maybe.

01:05:35.974 --> 01:05:38.091
You want me to show you
how I stay in shape?

to go to Hunts Bay Academy.

- You told him where you work?

- Zack.
- Zack? Nice to meet you.

- We'd better go.
- No, he ordered us shots.

- Olivia, let's go.
- Please, this is insulting my...

What the hell, Zack?

01:08:53.712 --> 01:08:56.456
I don't like being dragged
around like a cavewoman.

01:08:57.300 --> 01:08:59.041
That was Alexander Zogu.

No, I don't know him.

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:11.685
I've seen his pictures
in the papers.

01:09:12.649 --> 01:09:13.649
Oh.

01:09:15.443 --> 01:09:18.481
So, you were, like,
protecting me?

I just didn't like the way
he touched you.

01:09:24.077 --> 01:09:25.363
Huh.

that you did it anyways.

Olivia, listen,
I really like you

going to regret saying this,

01:10:04.033 --> 01:10:07.868

some other time?

01:10:10.081 --> 01:10:11.081
Yeah.

I want you to head
the surveillance team on Zogu.

I want to know where he is, I want
to know what he eats for lunch,

01:10:29.809 --> 01:10:31.846
I want to know what size
of a crap he takes,

01:10:32.437 --> 01:10:34.804
everything, until we get him
into that courtroom.

01:10:35.022 --> 01:10:36.022

01:10:36.107 --> 01:10:37.147
If Zogu knows about Olivia

01:10:37.358 --> 01:10:39.145
he's certainly made
the connection to Kevin.

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:41.380
But that doesn't mean he knows
about the kids' involvement.

- Dismiss!

- Out!
- Okay.

- You wanted to see me?
- Yes, come in.

do you know what this is?

01:11:27.366 --> 01:11:28.732
So you admit that it is yours?

What are you talking about?
That's Hal's taser.

to defend myself.

the credit cards?

hold up.

So, I heard you got laid off
from your job at the Times.

- I asked around.

No, you don't know anything.

When I was in school...

01:16:15.279 --> 01:16:16.360
My dad got sick.

01:16:16.572 --> 01:16:19.406
And when he died,
it hit me hard and I dropped out,

01:16:20.159 --> 01:16:22.742
I didn't think things
would get any better.

01:16:22.953 --> 01:16:27.948
But then one day I woke up, and
I just felt I had a lot more to give.

01:16:29.502 --> 01:16:31.869
I got a job
and I turned things around.

01:16:32.505 --> 01:16:34.497
Well, I've looked
for a job, okay?

01:16:35.007 --> 01:16:37.044

I know some people.
Let me ask around for you.

Would you do that for me?

01:16:43.682 --> 01:16:45.344
I'd do that for Molly.

01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:49.932
All I ask is, don't take it out
on your family.

- Do I hear 350$?

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:56.957
- I've got four.
- 450!

01:17:57.173 --> 01:17:59.460
- Five! 500.
- Do I hear six?

01:17:59.675 --> 01:18:01.883
- I got six, honey.
- Well, I got seven, honey!

01:18:02.094 --> 01:18:04.427
- Seven hundred.
- Fine, seven twenty-five!

01:18:04.638 --> 01:18:06.504
Seven twenty-five

SANDERS: Guys, Zogu is on the move,
surveillance is in place,

01:18:53.062 --> 01:18:54.062
I'm right behind him.

01:18:59.401 --> 01:19:01.313
I want to talk to you
about Mr. Flaherty.

01:19:02.154 --> 01:19:03.986
When is he coming back?

01:19:04.323 --> 01:19:07.737
He's dead, he's never coming back.
Worms are eating him.

01:19:07.952 --> 01:19:09.659
That's not true.

01:19:12.706 --> 01:19:14.447
Look at his face.

01:19:15.834 --> 01:19:18.201
I'm sorry,
what can I do for you?

01:19:24.718 --> 01:19:26.630
Okay. Good.

01:19:26.845 --> 01:19:30.714
Well, look, it's true
that Mr. Flaherty isn't coming back,

01:19:30.933 --> 01:19:32.765
but that doesn't mean
we can't remember him.

01:19:32.977 --> 01:19:34.977
Do you want to hear the poem
Mr. Flaherty taught us

01:19:35.062 --> 01:19:36.143
about Meeja the guinea pig?

01:19:36.355 --> 01:19:38.597
Hey, that's a great idea,
sure.

01:19:38.816 --> 01:19:41.274
- The guinea pig Meeja...
- Is a rodent and...

01:19:41.485 --> 01:19:42.771
Meeja is her name.

01:19:42.987 --> 01:19:45.650
- Every guinea pig loves...
- Carrott

01:19:45.864 --> 01:19:48.277
- And...
- People love guinea pigs!

01:19:48.492 --> 01:19:49.699
Nice job, guys.

Hey, calm down. Calm down.

01:20:11.015 --> 01:20:12.347
Calm down.

(SANDERS GROANS)

let's get on the bus, guys.

All right.

Take good care of them, okay?

01:20:30.159 --> 01:20:32.025
Yeah,
it's just the Sculpture Garden.

01:20:32.244 --> 01:20:34.201
I'm sure we'll be okay.

01:20:34.413 --> 01:20:35.413
All right.

01:20:36.915 --> 01:20:38.998
Have fun, kids. See ya.

01:20:39.209 --> 01:20:41.292
CHILDREN: Bye, Mr. Reed!

01:20:41.837 --> 01:20:42.837
We lost Zogu.

01:20:42.963 --> 01:20:44.750
What? When?

01:20:44.965 --> 01:20:47.207
He stole the surveillance van.
He's got everything.

01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:49.487
It's only a matter of time
before he figures out

01:20:49.511 --> 01:20:52.219
the kids are the key to finding
the drive and heads to the school.

01:20:52.431 --> 01:20:55.219
Understood. The kids are safe,
on the way to a field trip.

01:20:55.434 --> 01:20:56.434
I'm going back in.

01:20:56.477 --> 01:20:58.013
I'm in an Uber,
I'm five minutes out.

01:20:58.228 --> 01:21:00.515
Uber? Why didn't you
call for backup?

01:21:00.731 --> 01:21:02.438
They're on their way.
But Uber came faster.

01:21:02.649 --> 01:21:04.106
I'll meet you in the classroom.

01:21:06.028 --> 01:21:07.297
Miss Sinclaire,
can I speak to you?

01:21:07.321 --> 01:21:08.321
Yes.

01:21:08.489 --> 01:21:09.489
Be right back.

01:21:10.532 --> 01:21:11.760
You need
to lock down the school.

01:21:11.784 --> 01:21:12.618
Excuse me?

01:21:12.619 --> 01:21:14.109
I'm Zack Reed
with the FBI.

01:21:15.162 --> 01:21:16.448
What?

01:21:16.663 --> 01:21:18.279
Lock down the school now.

01:21:18.707 --> 01:21:22.166
Mr. Reed, this is a complete betrayal
of the circle of trust.

01:21:22.378 --> 01:21:25.416
How dare you bring this toxic...
This is strike two!

01:21:25.631 --> 01:21:26.917
You can chew me out later.

01:21:27.132 --> 01:21:29.527
Right now, you need to do what I say
and lock down the school.

01:21:29.551 --> 01:21:30.551
The kids are in danger.

01:21:31.053 --> 01:21:32.339
I'm locking it down.

01:21:40.104 --> 01:21:44.189
If you look down here, you might see
some of those tadpoles.

01:21:44.983 --> 01:21:46.019
Come on, guys.

01:21:46.985 --> 01:21:48.271
Go check out the park.

01:21:48.487 --> 01:21:49.487
Come on.

are handling everything.

Wait, wait. Stand back.

Hey, what are you doing here?

01:22:14.346 --> 01:22:15.824
We're supposed
to evacuate the school.

01:22:15.848 --> 01:22:17.448
Yeah, I know.
I just came back for Meeja.

01:22:17.558 --> 01:22:19.345
- Who's Meeja?
- That's the class pet.

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:21.329
I'm not supposed to leave her
during an evacuation.

01:22:21.353 --> 01:22:23.640
Listen, Olivia. It's not safe.
You need to go.

01:22:23.856 --> 01:22:26.223
Wait a second.
I heard that name before.

01:22:26.442 --> 01:22:27.276
Meeja.

01:22:27.277 --> 01:22:28.687
Meeja.

01:22:29.987 --> 01:22:32.821
Hey, that's what
Kevin called Jason.

01:22:33.157 --> 01:22:34.157
It was his nickname.

01:22:34.366 --> 01:22:35.652
Did you know Kevin, too?

01:22:35.868 --> 01:22:37.075
How's Meeja short for Jason?

01:22:37.286 --> 01:22:40.620
When Jason was a baby,
he would call himself "Me Jase"

01:22:40.831 --> 01:22:42.242
which would come out "Meeja."

01:22:42.458 --> 01:22:43.699
Kevin was his older brother.

01:22:43.917 --> 01:22:45.874
He called Jason "Meeja"
his whole life.

01:22:46.712 --> 01:22:47.752
It can't be a coincidence.

01:22:47.796 --> 01:22:49.583
Wait, hold on.
Hold on. I'm sorry.

01:22:49.798 --> 01:22:51.755
- Who are you?
- Just give us one minute.

01:22:51.967 --> 01:22:53.458
It can't be a coincidence.

01:22:53.677 --> 01:22:55.964
You think he hid the drive
in the guinea pig's cage?

01:22:57.139 --> 01:22:58.825
SANDERS: Man, that's too easy.
Kevin was smart.

01:22:58.849 --> 01:23:01.466
He was a hacker.
Into puzzles. Math games.

01:23:01.685 --> 01:23:04.519
He even competed in one of those
crossword puzzle competitions.

01:23:04.730 --> 01:23:06.016
Wait a second...

"The guinea pig Meeja
is a rodent

"and Meeja is her name."

01:23:13.822 --> 01:23:15.029
Huh.

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:17.573
- It's an acrostic poem.
- What?

01:23:17.784 --> 01:23:20.242
It's a poem where
the first letter of each line

01:23:20.454 --> 01:23:21.454
forms another word.

01:23:21.622 --> 01:23:23.614
He must've had the kids
memorize it.

01:23:23.832 --> 01:23:25.414
You're a genius, bro.

01:23:25.626 --> 01:23:27.618
Hey, recite it for me.

01:23:27.836 --> 01:23:28.836
Hold on, let's see.

01:23:28.921 --> 01:23:29.921
Okay. Uh...

The guinea pig Meeja

01:23:33.342 --> 01:23:34.708
is a rodent

01:23:34.927 --> 01:23:36.293
and Meeja is her name.

01:23:36.512 --> 01:23:39.801
Every guinea pig
loves carrots.

01:23:40.015 --> 01:23:41.015
Time...

01:23:41.099 --> 01:23:43.557

"Time capsule"!

01:23:46.563 --> 01:23:47.523
What's "time capsule"?

01:23:47.524 --> 01:23:49.060
Time capsule?

01:23:49.274 --> 01:23:51.074
It's the kids.
They're at the Sculpture Garden

01:23:51.276 --> 01:23:54.895
to bury this time capsule they made
with their tech teacher.

You see?

01:24:02.621 --> 01:24:04.328
I had faith in you.

01:24:06.041 --> 01:24:08.784
Hand over your weapons, now.

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:16.962
Zack, what is going on?

01:24:17.970 --> 01:24:19.531
Just take it easy.
No one needs to get hurt.

01:24:19.555 --> 01:24:20.555
I'm with the FBI.

- Wait. What?
- I'll explain later,

01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:24.100
just do what they say.

01:24:24.434 --> 01:24:25.970
That is very good advice.

01:24:29.481 --> 01:24:32.895
Now, it looks like
we're going on a field trip

01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:34.601
to the Sculpture Gardens.

01:24:36.196 --> 01:24:37.196

Agent Reed.

01:24:48.917 --> 01:24:53.708
It is very sloppy work for you
to get romantically involved

01:24:53.922 --> 01:24:55.288
on assignment.

01:24:56.091 --> 01:24:59.801
But then again,
this is your MO,

01:25:00.012 --> 01:25:01.423
now, isn't it?

01:25:05.767 --> 01:25:06.767
Move.

01:25:06.893 --> 01:25:07.727
Go.

Kill him.

01:25:15.527 --> 01:25:17.189
Of course.
Kill the black guy.

I'm sorry.

01:25:33.712 --> 01:25:34.712
You lied to me.

01:25:34.755 --> 01:25:36.337
I know, and I'm sorry.

01:25:37.341 --> 01:25:39.754
So everything that we are,
it's all just an act to you?

01:25:39.968 --> 01:25:42.711
No, I wasn't acting.

01:25:43.555 --> 01:25:45.075
I didn't lie about
my feelings for you.

01:25:47.434 --> 01:25:49.391

you know that?

Look, genius.

01:25:56.485 --> 01:25:59.148
Killing a federal agent,
you're looking at the death penalty.

01:25:59.363 --> 01:26:01.400
(LAUGHS)
Only if I get caught.

01:26:01.615 --> 01:26:03.356
Oh, the FBI will never
stop looking for you.

We like child support.
You're going to pay.

by the way?

bats are for.

01:26:37.025 --> 01:26:38.025
What a rush.

01:26:38.110 --> 01:26:40.147
So, we can never
actually really know

what life in the 22nd century
will be like.

01:26:43.365 --> 01:26:45.027

so that...

Uh, okay,
you kids just stay here.

You can look through
the time capsule.

Nobody move, all right?
Just stay here, I'll be right back.

01:26:58.046 --> 01:26:59.537

to do exactly what he says.

01:27:09.808 --> 01:27:10.924
Uh...

01:27:11.143 --> 01:27:13.009
Okay.
Is this about the flame war

01:27:13.228 --> 01:27:14.668
on the Game of Thrones
message board?

01:27:14.855 --> 01:27:17.518
(NERVOUS CHUCKLE)
Because I was totally joking.

01:27:17.733 --> 01:27:19.474
I don't even
own a broadsword.

01:27:19.693 --> 01:27:21.150
Hal, this is not about you.

01:27:21.361 --> 01:27:24.069
Just calm down
and do exactly what he says.

01:27:24.281 --> 01:27:25.817
Get rid of the children.

01:27:27.033 --> 01:27:28.490
Do it.

01:27:28.869 --> 01:27:29.869
Okay.

01:27:30.287 --> 01:27:31.287
Children, children.

01:27:31.413 --> 01:27:35.953
I need you to just go and play in
the rock garden for a minute, okay?

01:27:36.168 --> 01:27:38.000
And I'll join you
really soon, okay?

01:27:38.211 --> 01:27:39.211
Just go over there.

01:27:39.296 --> 01:27:41.504
If you get hungry,
there's snacks on the bus.

01:27:41.715 --> 01:27:44.048
There's kale chips
and carrot juice. Yummy.

01:27:47.471 --> 01:27:48.962
Cowboy,
go with the others.

01:27:49.181 --> 01:27:52.049
Be brave like Odysseus.

01:27:57.898 --> 01:27:59.764
You know, I think
it's probably a good idea

01:27:59.983 --> 01:28:01.627
if someone goes
and supervises the children?

01:28:01.651 --> 01:28:02.651
Because they're only six...

01:28:02.652 --> 01:28:05.440
ZOGU: No. No.
Not possible, fat man.

01:28:05.655 --> 01:28:07.647
You may call the police.
Hmm?

01:28:09.117 --> 01:28:15.660
Now, if you could be so kind
and give me that time capsule.

01:28:17.250 --> 01:28:18.250
Uh...

01:28:19.127 --> 01:28:20.743
You want the children's
time capsule?

01:28:20.962 --> 01:28:21.962
Just give it to him, Hal.

01:28:22.088 --> 01:28:23.088
Well, I...

01:28:23.256 --> 01:28:24.872
Okay, all right.

01:28:33.767 --> 01:28:34.767
Test it.

01:28:39.397 --> 01:28:40.638
(BEEPING)

01:28:45.028 --> 01:28:46.028
It's the database.

01:28:47.155 --> 01:28:48.155
Move.

01:28:53.245 --> 01:28:55.578
Okay, stop. Everyone.

01:28:56.248 --> 01:28:57.248
Right here.

01:28:57.874 --> 01:29:00.241
This is perfect.

01:29:01.461 --> 01:29:03.874
Now you can sleep
with the fishes. (LAUGHING)

- REED: Hold on.
- Uh-uh.

01:29:10.011 --> 01:29:11.011
Last meal.

01:29:12.264 --> 01:29:13.264
Twix?

01:29:15.809 --> 01:29:16.809
Okay.

01:29:17.644 --> 01:29:18.644
Is good candy bar.

01:29:25.402 --> 01:29:26.768
You won't get away
with this, Zogu.

01:29:27.279 --> 01:29:28.736
Oh, I think I will.

01:29:30.532 --> 01:29:36.449
When a man of superior force
overwhelms a weaker enemy,

01:29:36.663 --> 01:29:37.904
there is no hope.

01:29:41.751 --> 01:29:43.208
There's always hope.

Stay with Miss Olivia!

01:30:38.642 --> 01:30:40.099

did you see that?

I can see
you're really upset, Zogu.

01:32:17.907 --> 01:32:21.275
But we can work this out
if we just talk about our feelings.

01:32:21.494 --> 01:32:26.535
You have spent way too much time
in kindergarten!

01:32:31.212 --> 01:32:33.078
Oh, boy. (GROANING)

Class dismissed.

SANDERS: Are you serious?

01:32:38.762 --> 01:32:40.362
That's the best thing
you could think of?

01:32:42.849 --> 01:32:44.966
It sounded a lot cooler
in my head.

01:32:47.145 --> 01:32:48.477
Get out of there, man.

you're my favorite.

I am so delighted
to lock your ass up.

01:33:05.497 --> 01:33:08.331
did your parents name you
after an ointment or a rash?
