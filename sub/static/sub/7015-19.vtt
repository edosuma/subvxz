WEBVTT

00:04.354 --> 00:06.812
Okay, the game is
"password."

00:07.004 --> 00:09.441
The box says,
"using one-word clues,

00:09.471 --> 00:12.984
"get your partner to say the secret word
without using the word yourself."

00:13.295 --> 00:15.189
- Okay, what if...
- Donna, please,

00:16.634 --> 00:18.366
I already read the box.

00:19.754 --> 00:21.269
- But, Fez...
- I said box!

00:22.578 --> 00:26.383
Okay, here are your secret
words. And good luck.

00:27.193 --> 00:28.238
Okay, Eric,

00:29.271 --> 00:30.950
staircase...

00:32.932 --> 00:33.930
Jedi.

00:36.442 --> 00:38.638
I'm sorry,
that's wrong.

00:39.836 --> 00:40.552
Hyde?

00:42.405 --> 00:43.320
um...

00:45.211 --> 00:46.033
Fat.

00:48.992 --> 00:50.119
Staircase,

00:51.269 --> 00:52.124
fat...

00:53.885 --> 00:55.141
- Escalator!
- Yes!

00:55.165 --> 00:56.456
That is correct!

00:56.480 --> 00:58.018
- What?
- What the hell?

00:58.042 --> 01:00.190
Jackie, see me later
for your prize.

01:02.854 --> 01:06.388
Oh, we are
so better than you.

01:06.623 --> 01:07.421
Eric,

01:07.539 --> 01:10.497
how did you get "Jedi"
from "Staircase"?

01:10.556 --> 01:13.860
Uh, Donna,
the path to becoming a Jedi

01:13.907 --> 01:15.704
has many steps.

01:16.995 --> 01:21.303
You guys, I just took my baby girl to the
playground, and she's just like her daddy.

01:21.338 --> 01:24.227
She's way cuter than
all the other babies

01:24.532 --> 01:26.974
and she eats bugs.

01:28.019 --> 01:31.495
Wow, Michael, you've spent every
weekend this month with Betsy.

01:31.601 --> 01:34.796
The only other thing you've done
this consistently was cheat on me.

01:35.724 --> 01:36.722
That's not true.

01:36.745 --> 01:40.328
He also glues himself to stuff
with amazing regularity.

01:41.373 --> 01:42.324
Whatever.

01:42.371 --> 01:46.011
Look, Brooke is totally starting to
trust me now with Betsy.

01:46.043 --> 01:49.595
And she's letting me
pick out Betsy's godparents.

01:49.630 --> 01:52.431
And she only has one rule...
it can't be Fez.

01:53.939 --> 01:55.577
Well,
that is a smart rule.

01:56.458 --> 01:59.229
Godparents? Like we need
any more responsibilities.

01:59.253 --> 02:02.000
I know, such a burden.

02:02.033 --> 02:02.902
Okay,

02:03.336 --> 02:07.540
so I've been thinking about this
a lot, all right? And it's a big deal. So,

02:08.221 --> 02:09.583
Eric, Donna...

02:09.618 --> 02:10.508
uh-oh...

02:10.543 --> 02:14.665
please scooch over so I can ask Hyde
and Jackie if they'll be Betsy's godparents.

02:15.639 --> 02:17.729
- What the hell?
- Hyde and Jackie?

02:17.776 --> 02:20.878
We win! I was voted
most popular,

02:20.902 --> 02:23.556
best legs and
now godmother?

02:23.743 --> 02:25.422
What can't I do?

02:26.444 --> 02:28.113
And the password is...

02:28.853 --> 02:29.827
a burn.

Oh, my god,
this place is a mess!

03:14.578 --> 03:17.290
Well, it's obvious.
You've had a break-in.

03:19.228 --> 03:21.224
And that pizza box
is a clue.

03:23.502 --> 03:25.862
Yep, they're Italian.

03:29.050 --> 03:31.152
Someone
broke into my store.

03:31.175 --> 03:32.655
What if
they stole something?

03:32.678 --> 03:33.547
Oh, no.

03:39.418 --> 03:41.747
It's okay.
My stash is safe.

03:42.616 --> 03:44.130
Not entirely.

03:44.576 --> 03:47.207
I got into it
a little bit yesterday.

03:47.805 --> 03:49.766
You guys,
what are we gonna do?

03:49.931 --> 03:51.139
What are we gonna do?

03:51.890 --> 03:53.226
We don't have to do nothing.

03:53.438 --> 03:56.303
Nothing big was taken.
Probably some kids having fun.

03:56.455 --> 03:57.336
Fun?

03:57.782 --> 03:59.718
Yeah, you know, fun...

03:59.788 --> 04:01.561
that thing
you've never had.

04:03.522 --> 04:06.469
I have plenty of fun,
okay?

04:06.504 --> 04:07.281
Michael,

04:07.527 --> 04:08.654
I'm fun, right?

04:10.885 --> 04:12.083
You're good-lookin'.

04:17.082 --> 04:20.334
Well, I think you would
make a great godparent, Eric.

04:20.370 --> 04:23.071
You were so sweet
with your pet fish.

04:23.902 --> 04:26.521
Remember? You'd feed
it potato chips and say:

04:26.544 --> 04:28.763
"Look, everybody,
fish and chips."

04:33.200 --> 04:36.734
All I remember is flushing
it down the toilet when he killed it.

04:38.754 --> 04:41.325
Who takes a fish
out of the tank?

04:42.758 --> 04:45.119
I just needed
to hug something.

04:48.089 --> 04:50.262
Why do think Kelso
didn't choose us?

04:50.309 --> 04:53.784
Well, picking godparents
can be very nerve-racking.

04:53.831 --> 04:57.314
When Laurie was born, we agonized
over that decision for weeks.

04:57.349 --> 05:00.578
And we chose well. Mike and
Cookie were good people.

05:00.895 --> 05:01.975
Wait, so

05:02.316 --> 05:03.899
who are
my godparents?

05:04.415 --> 05:06.059
Well, they're the...

05:10.909 --> 05:12.550
The Hoffenschloffers.

05:15.181 --> 05:16.907
I'm sorry, the who?

05:17.682 --> 05:19.361
The Higgengloopers.

05:20.077 --> 05:23.752
Okay, I think you just said
The Hoffenschnoppers,

05:23.952 --> 05:26.371
and then you said
The Hingengloobers,

05:27.064 --> 05:30.713
and I'm not sure, but I don't think we know
any Hoffenschnoppers or Hingengloobers.

05:30.877 --> 05:33.448
Come on, what's supposed to
happen to me if you guys die?

05:33.484 --> 05:35.738
Maybe you'll finally
move out and get a job.

05:36.865 --> 05:37.719
Ugh.

05:38.095 --> 05:41.218
You know, the responsibilities
of being a godmother never ends.

05:41.253 --> 05:44.001
You know, I spent all day
buying matching outfits.

05:45.973 --> 05:49.853
You know, life is so much more fulfilling
now that I'm shopping for two.

05:50.745 --> 05:53.939
Okay, being a godmother
isn't all about buying stuff.

05:54.303 --> 05:55.325
Oh, yeah?

05:55.689 --> 05:56.898
What's it about then?

05:58.483 --> 05:59.822
Oh, you don't know either.

06:02.440 --> 06:03.344
You guys,

06:03.678 --> 06:05.227
great news.

06:05.404 --> 06:08.374
Brooke is gonna let me have
Betsy on the weekends.

06:08.398 --> 06:09.407
Oh, my god.

06:09.564 --> 06:11.067
If Betsy's coming
here on weekends,

06:11.102 --> 06:14.413
we're gonna need matching
godmother/goddaughter badminton skirts.

06:15.493 --> 06:17.572
Now you're just trying
to make me mad.

06:17.769 --> 06:20.000
Okay, you know what? We don't have to
stand here and take this. Let's go.

06:20.035 --> 06:21.703
Yeah. Where are we going?

06:21.761 --> 06:26.552
Um, I don't know, but we are just going
to stand outside until they leave!

06:32.685 --> 06:36.478
Well, I am proud of you, Michael,
getting so involved in your baby's life.

06:36.513 --> 06:39.343
A child needs
a strong, loving father.

06:39.391 --> 06:42.433
Well, I am glad
you feel that way.

06:42.468 --> 06:45.885
So you won't mind when Betsy visits
if we stay up in Laurie's room?

06:45.920 --> 06:46.951
No.

06:50.180 --> 06:51.577
No babies.

06:53.209 --> 06:55.452
We get enough crying
around here with Eric.

06:57.265 --> 06:59.425
Come on. Laurie's not using it.

06:59.449 --> 07:02.255
It's a great room
with a very comfortable bed.

07:04.873 --> 07:07.336
How the hell
would you know that?

07:07.700 --> 07:11.235
Uh, Laurie always
has such...

07:11.270 --> 07:12.514
good posture.

07:16.274 --> 07:18.810
That indicates
a quality mattress.

07:19.667 --> 07:21.476
What's wrong
with your house, honey?

07:21.499 --> 07:22.826
It's not safe.

07:24.458 --> 07:28.118
If my brothers don't step on her,
one of the dogs probably will.

07:28.611 --> 07:29.914
You have dogs?

07:29.938 --> 07:31.687
We don't know
whose they are.

07:40.616 --> 07:42.096
Hey, you're here early.

07:42.483 --> 07:44.150
Not early enough.

07:44.504 --> 07:46.172
We were broken into again.

07:47.076 --> 07:49.694
Well, at least these kids
leave more than they take.

07:51.150 --> 07:53.487
We're not being robbed, man.
We're being cluttered.

07:54.454 --> 07:55.793
I'm calling the cops.

07:55.840 --> 07:57.930
No, don't call the cops.

07:58.118 --> 07:59.034
Why not?

07:59.198 --> 08:01.535
Cause then they show up
and they act all cop-py.

08:03.143 --> 08:04.494
You know what I think?

08:04.517 --> 08:07.152
I think you're the one
coming in here at night.

08:07.305 --> 08:09.500
Why would I come here
when I have a house?

08:10.508 --> 08:11.894
Well, a basement.

08:13.913 --> 08:17.166
Why don't you tell me about the
$10 missing from the register?

08:17.411 --> 08:19.043
Are you accusing
me of stealing?

08:19.078 --> 08:22.777
Well, you don't want me to call the cops,
and of all the people I know...

08:22.812 --> 08:24.608
and I know 28 people...

08:25.865 --> 08:29.080
you are by far
the most likely to burgle.

08:29.960 --> 08:33.131
Yeah, you know, I don't actually
have to take this from you, Angie.

08:34.446 --> 08:36.687
I thought you didn't
call the cops.

08:36.816 --> 08:37.873
I didn't.

08:38.472 --> 08:39.246
Guys,

08:39.599 --> 08:42.124
I don't know how
to turn off the siren!

08:48.952 --> 08:50.631
Hey, Fez, let me
ask you a question.

08:51.382 --> 08:53.261
If you were choosing
godparents,

08:53.543 --> 08:55.116
wouldn't you choose
Donna and me?

08:55.480 --> 08:57.244
Well, in my country,
we don't have godparents.

08:57.297 --> 08:59.975
If something happens
to your parents, tough crap.

09:01.255 --> 09:02.464
You're a bum.

09:03.791 --> 09:06.219
You americans
and your safety nets.

09:10.387 --> 09:12.548
Eric, are your
folks around?

09:12.583 --> 09:13.241
Why?

09:13.379 --> 09:16.420
Do you wanna bestow some honor
on them that we should rightly have?

09:16.819 --> 09:20.424
No. I'm trying to sneak
this crib up into Laurie's room,

09:20.459 --> 09:24.264
and I figure if I get it up there, there's no way
they can get it down 'cause they're too old.

09:25.671 --> 09:28.418
Kelso, I just can't believe
you picked Hyde over me.

09:28.442 --> 09:32.011
I mean, what exactly was your
criteria in choosing a godparent? I mean,

09:32.047 --> 09:34.348
was it the ability
to shoplift a keg?

09:38.121 --> 09:40.070
My reasons are complicated.

09:41.350 --> 09:43.311
Complicated or stupid?

09:44.990 --> 09:46.815
There are elements of both.

09:58.527 --> 09:59.337
Down.

10:01.288 --> 10:01.939
But...

10:01.965 --> 10:02.824
Down.

10:12.797 --> 10:16.871
Well, we were broken into again last night,
but you already know that since it was you.

10:18.567 --> 10:20.493
Yeah, you busted me, Angie,

10:20.516 --> 10:24.274
sneaking into my own store so I can
eat pizza and listen to Neil Sedaka.

10:26.293 --> 10:30.657
After the second break-in, I had Michael
install a hidden surveillance camera.

10:30.692 --> 10:32.958
It's the same one he tried
to use in my shower.

10:34.484 --> 10:35.823
You spied on me?

10:35.858 --> 10:36.504
Yep,

10:36.613 --> 10:39.466
and I thought we could watch
the tape for the first time together.

10:39.501 --> 10:42.014
Hey, I'm watching
"Perry Mason."

10:43.388 --> 10:46.100
Oh, guess what.
Perry Mason wins.

10:49.302 --> 10:53.916
It's not if he wins, it's how.
That's the magic, damn it.

10:56.234 --> 10:58.300
Oh, look, there's Michael.

11:14.199 --> 11:17.146
Even when he's not here,
I have to see his ass.

11:18.734 --> 11:22.256
I've seen it almost as many times
as I've seen his face.

11:23.489 --> 11:25.368
Oh, look, someone's coming in.

11:29.579 --> 11:30.577
- Fez?
- Fez?

11:35.861 --> 11:39.217
Hey, Red. Am I late for "Perry Mason"?
Ooh, who's that handsome...

11:47.858 --> 11:48.621
Uh-oh.

11:50.171 --> 11:52.237
Fez, what are you
doing there?

11:52.284 --> 11:53.928
It was a secret.

11:55.795 --> 11:58.206
I- I thought I was alone.

11:58.965 --> 12:02.523
Okay, I know Fez pretty well,
and if he thought he was alone,

12:03.404 --> 12:05.904
we need to stop
this tape right now.

12:13.674 --> 12:16.116
Fez, man, why were you
staying at the record store?

12:16.480 --> 12:19.638
Well, last week my
bible-thumping host parents...

12:21.800 --> 12:26.896
found out that I already graduated, so they
kicked me out and took all my money as back rent.

12:29.397 --> 12:31.064
And then they
gave me a bible.

12:33.340 --> 12:37.144
Well, I wish you had been reading that instead
of the porno magazines I found in my office.

12:37.179 --> 12:38.846
You know, Angie,

12:38.905 --> 12:41.265
some things you could
keep to yourself.

12:42.569 --> 12:46.218
I don't understand why you didn't just
ask us for help. I mean, we're your friends.

12:46.453 --> 12:48.261
It's my damn latin pride.

12:49.447 --> 12:50.704
So you're latin.

12:50.744 --> 12:52.177
No, just my pride is.

12:59.478 --> 13:02.226
And I also have
a swiss sense of frugality.

13:04.034 --> 13:08.019
Steven, how could you not
know your friend was a hobo?

13:09.874 --> 13:12.269
Well, now that
I think about it,

13:12.751 --> 13:15.181
some things do make
more sense.

13:17.048 --> 13:18.784
Man, where the
hell are my keys?

13:18.819 --> 13:21.426
Oh, here they are.
I just borrowed them.

13:22.495 --> 13:24.315
But I didn't
make a copy.

13:25.277 --> 13:26.592
Why would you
make a copy?

13:26.628 --> 13:27.776
Why would I borrow them?

13:27.823 --> 13:28.891
To make a copy.

13:28.927 --> 13:30.195
Why would I make a copy?

13:31.134 --> 13:31.979
Okay.

13:44.189 --> 13:45.668
Did you just take
a shower here?

13:46.596 --> 13:47.406
No.

13:48.888 --> 13:50.568
Why are you
wearing a towel?

13:51.084 --> 13:53.738
Because otherwise
I'd be naked.

14:03.839 --> 14:04.473
Oh,

14:04.837 --> 14:05.858
there they are.

14:10.602 --> 14:13.338
Hey, I was just happy he was
wearing underwear again, all right?

14:18.696 --> 14:21.244
I can't believe
Kelso didn't choose us.

14:21.291 --> 14:23.041
What could be
wrong with us?

14:23.064 --> 14:23.781
Well,

14:24.350 --> 14:27.004
there's nothing wrong with you.
I love you just the way you are.

14:27.107 --> 14:30.512
- Yeah, and I love you just the way you...
- although, well...

14:32.602 --> 14:34.199
It might be that
you don't have a job.

14:34.234 --> 14:34.891
Oh.

14:36.697 --> 14:40.159
Here it comes. Oh, you've just been
dying to get this off your chest, huh?

14:40.194 --> 14:43.071
I don't have a job.
I play with toys.

14:44.092 --> 14:46.751
Maybe you'd like to talk about how
I didn't show up for the wedding, too?

14:47.068 --> 14:51.585
Oh, well, I don't need to talk about that because I
relive it every morning when I wake up alone!

14:51.620 --> 14:54.579
Oh, really? Well, you used
to be a redhead!

14:54.602 --> 14:57.772
You dyed your hair. God, it's like
everything about you now is so fake!

14:57.808 --> 14:58.524
Whoa!

14:59.569 --> 15:01.035
You said you
loved my hair.

15:01.071 --> 15:04.288
I had to say that, Donna, to
keep you happy. You trap people.

15:04.323 --> 15:07.429
You're a trapper. Nobody wants a
trapper for a godmother.

15:07.464 --> 15:08.802
Okay, wait a minute.

15:09.936 --> 15:11.052
What are we doing?

15:11.538 --> 15:13.520
You know what?
You're right. Let's back up.

15:15.810 --> 15:18.604
Why do we wanna
be godparents so bad?

15:18.663 --> 15:19.450
Well...

15:20.048 --> 15:23.898
I want it for the joy of nurturing
the spiritual growth of a child.

15:25.436 --> 15:27.303
I want it
for the prestige.

15:28.078 --> 15:29.827
Yeah, me too.
I was just saying that.

15:35.321 --> 15:36.401
Hello!

15:39.630 --> 15:42.366
Why does everybody
look so serious?

15:44.171 --> 15:46.203
Did the good
year blimp crash?

15:47.776 --> 15:48.551
Why?

15:50.653 --> 15:51.627
No reason.

15:53.835 --> 15:57.299
Some people shoot
bottle rockets at it.

15:58.908 --> 16:03.381
Fez has been living in the record store
because his host parents threw him out.

16:03.839 --> 16:07.583
What kind of parents
would kick a child out?

16:08.593 --> 16:11.153
And will they teach
me how they did it?

16:13.419 --> 16:16.623
You wanna be mean,
you don't get a sandwich.

16:18.630 --> 16:21.378
I think what they did
to you is just awful.

16:21.401 --> 16:22.963
He broke
into my store.

16:22.998 --> 16:25.605
Which you accused me
of doing.

16:25.640 --> 16:29.460
Accusing your own brother.
You don't get a sandwich either.

16:31.762 --> 16:34.509
Anyway, Fez, maybe you
can stay in Laurie's room.

16:34.533 --> 16:35.295
No.

16:35.835 --> 16:38.571
I would rather fill that
room with cement.

16:40.004 --> 16:42.882
Yeah, respect
a man's wishes.

16:42.917 --> 16:45.043
Besides, that room's
for me and Betsy.

16:47.567 --> 16:49.434
I don't get a sandwich.

16:52.584 --> 16:54.451
Okay, I have an idea.

16:55.226 --> 16:58.866
You and Fez both need
a place to live, right?

16:58.901 --> 16:59.931
Yeah.

17:00.201 --> 17:03.583
And living alone can
get kind of lonely, can't it?

17:03.829 --> 17:06.071
Sometimes I cry
myself to sleep.

17:07.896 --> 17:09.281
You see where
I'm going with this?

17:09.318 --> 17:10.222
I do.

17:10.386 --> 17:13.909
We each get our own apartment and
we call each other on the phone a lot.

17:15.564 --> 17:17.525
Or we could
be roommates!

17:19.330 --> 17:20.259
Roommates?

17:21.776 --> 17:24.911
That is an awesome idea!

17:27.098 --> 17:29.248
What were you thinking
of, Mrs. Forman?

17:34.379 --> 17:35.096
That...

17:35.730 --> 17:37.642
you two
should be roommates.

17:38.546 --> 17:40.765
- Oh, thanks, but we already thought of that.
- Yeah.

17:45.349 --> 17:46.194
All right,

17:46.441 --> 17:49.106
why did you
choose them over us?

17:49.928 --> 17:51.102
Is it 'cause
I don't have a job?

17:51.126 --> 17:52.934
Is it because
I dyed my hair?

17:53.533 --> 17:57.060
Look, I don't have a job because
Hyde turned me into a burnout.

17:58.163 --> 18:01.944
And I dyed my hair because
Jackie destroyed my self-esteem.

18:02.402 --> 18:04.856
Also, I rock as a blonde.

18:05.584 --> 18:08.357
Are you beginning to see the influence
that they have on people?

18:08.381 --> 18:09.808
I'm telling you, if
you stick with them,

18:09.823 --> 18:13.068
your daughter's just gonna be a burnout,
low self-esteem lump with no job.

18:13.978 --> 18:16.679
All right, you're just trying
to make us look bad.

18:16.808 --> 18:18.810
Yeah, they're doing
a decent job of it.

18:19.738 --> 18:21.898
Kelso, why did
you pick us?

18:23.965 --> 18:26.231
Great. Now I feel awkward.

18:26.724 --> 18:30.577
Look, I picked them because I think
they're gonna last longer than you.

18:31.728 --> 18:32.420
What?

18:32.453 --> 18:34.943
They just broke up
and got back together.

18:35.166 --> 18:37.573
Well, at least they're
doing somethin'.

18:38.500 --> 18:39.933
What are you guys doin'?

18:39.980 --> 18:42.091
You don't know.
Nobody knows!

18:42.690 --> 18:45.273
They're just a
safer bet right now.

18:45.320 --> 18:46.764
Oh, my god.

18:47.281 --> 18:50.253
This is better than when
he made us godparents.

18:51.439 --> 18:53.376
We win everything!

18:55.278 --> 18:56.006
Wow.

18:56.488 --> 18:57.133
Well...

18:58.848 --> 19:00.891
I don't really have
a speech prepared, but...

19:02.981 --> 19:04.695
I just wanna thank
you guys for sucking.

19:09.228 --> 19:11.106
Look, you guys,

19:11.517 --> 19:14.698
if I knock somebody else up,
you're totally on the list.

19:19.970 --> 19:22.870
I can't believe he doesn't
think we're gonna last. It's...

19:23.641 --> 19:25.626
you don't think
he's right, do you?

19:25.649 --> 19:28.772
Well, I don't know. We have
kind of been drifting this last year.

19:28.796 --> 19:29.489
No,

19:30.275 --> 19:32.421
no, not drifting.
You know,

19:32.492 --> 19:33.525
exploring.

19:35.122 --> 19:37.412
Exploring is drifting, Eric.

19:37.447 --> 19:40.969
Oh, you know what? This is all your fault.
You're always saying that

19:41.035 --> 19:43.160
something is something else.

19:43.195 --> 19:46.401
God, it's like you're a
big, blonde thesaurus.

19:47.152 --> 19:49.853
Well, excuse me
for knowing words, Eric.

19:49.876 --> 19:53.455
Okay, you know what? This fight keeps going
nowhere, and you wanna know why?

19:53.490 --> 19:57.036
We are actually freaking out
over something that Kelso said.

19:57.471 --> 20:01.809
Kelso, the guy who doesn't understand
how hot dogs survive in the wild without eyes.

20:03.746 --> 20:06.599
Okay, so you're not...
you're not worried, then?

20:06.623 --> 20:07.280
No.

20:08.748 --> 20:11.975
I don't know. Maybe a little bit,
but I'll tell you what.

20:13.290 --> 20:14.769
I'm gonna find a job.

20:14.910 --> 20:16.988
Great, and I'm gonna
dye my hair back.

20:17.012 --> 20:19.875
No, oh, no, no.
The blonde stays.

20:20.344 --> 20:21.589
I'm still using it.

20:28.235 --> 20:30.113
All right, man, you
accused me of stealing,

20:30.137 --> 20:32.755
so I've thought up a very
clever way of getting you back.

20:32.779 --> 20:35.949
Today you wear
the rainbow afro.

20:38.477 --> 20:40.015
Actually, you know what?

20:40.355 --> 20:42.222
I don't think so.

20:42.492 --> 20:43.549
Watch this.

20:50.288 --> 20:54.019
Luck be a lady tonight.

20:56.849 --> 21:00.395
Luck be a lady tonight.

21:02.905 --> 21:08.261
Luck if you've ever
been a lady to begin...

21:10.985 --> 21:12.371
I don't care about that.

21:12.606 --> 21:15.283
Everybody knows
I sing Sinatra all the time.

21:16.774 --> 21:18.380
Whoa, shoplifter!

21:18.415 --> 21:19.684
Amateur.

21:24.336 --> 21:27.911
Here's two bedrooms
with one and a half baths.

21:28.522 --> 21:29.943
A half bath?

21:32.350 --> 21:34.146
How does the
water stay in?

21:36.011 --> 21:37.889
Here's one
with a dishwasher.

21:37.936 --> 21:41.318
Ah, I don't want another
foreigner living with us.

21:42.704 --> 21:45.075
We don't need a
dishwasher anyway.

21:45.409 --> 21:47.112
Who's gonna do
the dishes?

21:47.570 --> 21:49.108
We'll just order in.

21:50.294 --> 21:52.454
You never wanna
take me anywhere.
