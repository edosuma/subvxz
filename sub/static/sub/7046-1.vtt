01:09.028 --> 01:10.321
This is it.

01:10.488 --> 01:12.928
This fine trail, we're gonna be
the first ever to complete it.

01:13.241 --> 01:14.617
You're insane, Utah.

01:14.784 --> 01:16.624
- There's no way to ride that.
- There's a way.

01:16.995 --> 01:17.996
You just gotta trust.

01:20.707 --> 01:22.834
Come on, Jeff.
This is exactly what our sponsors want.

01:23.835 --> 01:27.088
The impossible realized.
And all those YouTube hits.

01:28.798 --> 01:30.798
Anyway, we gotta earn
these bikes we're sittin' on,

01:30.925 --> 01:32.135
and it beats workin' for a livin'.

01:32.302 --> 01:34.137
Yeah, well...
While I'm workin' for a livin',

01:34.304 --> 01:36.904
you'll be suckin' meals through a straw
for the rest of your life.

01:37.015 --> 01:38.016
I like smoothies.

01:40.393 --> 01:41.519
We got this, bro'.

01:42.395 --> 01:43.396
Just follow my line.

01:51.112 --> 01:53.156
Utah to Heli, we're doin' this.

03:38.970 --> 03:39.971
Whoo-hoo!

03:40.638 --> 03:41.639
Come on, man!

03:53.610 --> 03:54.694
Jeff! Jeff!

04:00.825 --> 04:02.827
- Hold on, hold on!
- Gas to that gas tank!

04:03.161 --> 04:04.579
Pull! Come on, pull!

04:33.942 --> 04:35.443
<i>This is a new world, son.</i>

04:37.070 --> 04:39.656
<i>When you join the FBI,
you join the front line</i>

04:39.822 --> 04:41.866
<i>in the war between order and chaos.</i>

04:42.367 --> 04:45.328
<i>So, the question is,
are you ready for that fight, Utah?</i>

04:45.870 --> 04:47.163
Brigham, sir.

04:48.873 --> 04:49.916
<i>My name's Brigham.</i>

04:51.167 --> 04:54.045
Utah's a nickname
my classmates got off YouTube.

05:01.427 --> 05:02.787
That world that you came out of...

05:06.349 --> 05:07.892
Pretty wild, huh?

05:09.894 --> 05:11.229
It had its moments.

05:13.314 --> 05:15.566
Why leave all that

05:15.733 --> 05:17.527
for all this structure?

05:18.111 --> 05:19.362
Maybe I could use some structure, sir.

05:19.654 --> 05:23.074
And maybe there's a part of you
doesn't want anything to do with it. Hmm?

05:28.997 --> 05:30.237
I know why you left that world.

05:33.001 --> 05:35.461
I know what happened
in that world to that kid.

05:36.045 --> 05:37.255
Jeff, was it?

05:39.298 --> 05:40.591
Yes, sir.

05:41.759 --> 05:43.039
How bad do you really want this?

05:43.761 --> 05:46.514
Bad enough to have gotten my high school
equivalency at 23, sir.

05:46.681 --> 05:48.850
Bad enough to have gone to college
and law school

05:49.017 --> 05:50.435
five years after my peers had graduated.

05:50.601 --> 05:51.728
Yeah, I saw that.

05:51.894 --> 05:56.107
The Bureau reviewed all my credentials
before they admitted me into this program.

05:56.274 --> 05:58.034
I'm not sure why you're
second-guessing them.

05:58.276 --> 05:59.986
Because it's my job, son,

06:00.153 --> 06:02.697
<i>to only let the most qualified
get past me.</i>

06:03.031 --> 06:05.783
Because I'm not convinced
that you are an FBI agent

06:06.075 --> 06:07.285
<i>in the making.</i>

06:07.702 --> 06:09.829
- I want this.
- Well, then, show me.

06:11.914 --> 06:13.541
Yes, sir.

06:15.126 --> 06:17.879
<i>This is what chaos looks like.</i>

06:18.046 --> 06:19.464
And make no mistake,

06:19.630 --> 06:21.632
these perps were very, very smart.

06:22.842 --> 06:25.219
Had a sense of humor, too.

06:25.386 --> 06:28.306
10 million carats of diamonds were lost.

06:29.223 --> 06:30.516
<i>And Mahana Carbon</i>

06:30.683 --> 06:32.163
<i>is a majority American-owned company,</i>

06:32.310 --> 06:34.312
so we, the FBI, are interested.

06:35.605 --> 06:37.899
30th of last month was a Friday,

06:38.066 --> 06:41.861
so, the entire month's yield
from the company's mines was on hand.

06:42.945 --> 06:45.490
Their mistake was believing
that nobody could ever rob

06:45.823 --> 06:48.493
and successfully make a getaway
from a sorting facility

06:48.659 --> 06:51.370
100 stories above the Earth.

06:51.954 --> 06:54.082
And their security failed to foresee

06:54.332 --> 06:58.377
that there might exist a set of perps
with an unusual skill set.

06:59.003 --> 07:01.839
They saw potential police intervention
on the ground,

07:02.215 --> 07:03.424
and they improvised.

07:08.805 --> 07:12.100
They got away with 100 million
in uncut diamonds,

07:12.266 --> 07:15.103
and then gave it all away
to the poorest of the poor

07:15.269 --> 07:17.396
in the slums of Mumbai.

07:18.189 --> 07:20.149
Who in the world would do that?

07:21.400 --> 07:23.840
This case is right now.
These guys are out there in real time.

07:25.321 --> 07:26.489
<i>And I need a theory.</i>

07:27.115 --> 07:30.243
What kind of people
are we dealing with here?

08:07.071 --> 08:08.239
Malfunction to ramp override.

08:08.739 --> 08:09.740
Oh, shit!

09:44.502 --> 09:45.544
Sir, what's going on?

09:45.711 --> 09:48.839
U.S. plane carrying money got hijacked
over San Luis Potosi in Mexico.

09:49.006 --> 09:51.566
Perps jumped out over the jungle
and disappeared without a trace.

09:51.592 --> 09:53.594
We're looking for the bodies.

10:07.400 --> 10:08.401
Excuse me, sir.

10:10.069 --> 10:11.696
Do you have a minute?

10:12.029 --> 10:14.532
We have two crimes
on two different continents.

10:14.865 --> 10:18.327
Diamond-sorting facility in Mumbai,
and today's cargo plane over Mexico.

10:18.953 --> 10:21.038
But there's a third crime
on a third continent.

10:22.039 --> 10:23.207
Remember about a month ago,

10:23.374 --> 10:25.835
there was an international logging
complex that was burned to the ground

10:26.127 --> 10:27.847
- on the banks of the Congo River...
- Yeah.

10:28.087 --> 10:29.714
...which is where
the world's most dangerous rapids are.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.640
Now I think
the people that started that fire

10:31.757 --> 10:35.469
also became the first ever to
navigate and survive the Inga Rapids.

10:35.636 --> 10:39.515
You're saying
this is connected to the other two?

10:39.974 --> 10:41.809
I think they're all connected, sir.

10:42.268 --> 10:43.269
Here.

10:43.978 --> 10:45.298
Two days before the Mumbai heist,

10:45.604 --> 10:48.274
only 1,000 miles away,
these three were photographed

10:48.566 --> 10:51.152
base-jumping from the peak of Everest.

10:52.236 --> 10:53.362
<i>They're the same people.</i>

10:54.697 --> 10:55.865
Same people...

10:57.575 --> 10:59.952
Then what are they really up to here?

11:00.119 --> 11:02.538
<i>I don't know why
they're committing the crimes, sir.</i>

11:02.705 --> 11:04.305
<i>But I have an idea what they're chasing.</i>

11:06.125 --> 11:08.753
I think they're attempting
something called The Ozaki Eight.

11:13.507 --> 11:16.135
This is Ono Ozaki.

11:16.510 --> 11:17.803
He was an eco-warrior,

11:17.970 --> 11:20.806
one of the first recognized
Extreme Poly-Athletes.

11:21.474 --> 11:24.352
<i>Now he challenged the Extreme Sports world
to a series</i>

11:24.518 --> 11:28.105
<i>of eight ordeals that he said
honored the forces of nature.</i>

11:30.691 --> 11:33.069
Anyone who could find
the perfect line existing

11:33.444 --> 11:37.948
through each one of these ordeals,
he believed, would achieve nirvana.

11:39.367 --> 11:42.161
So, this is not about money?

11:42.620 --> 11:44.955
It's about spiritual enlightenment?

11:45.247 --> 11:46.582
Exactly.

11:47.666 --> 11:50.586
An extreme athlete could potentially train

11:50.753 --> 11:54.048
their entire life
just to attempt one of these ordeals.

11:55.591 --> 11:59.136
To complete all eight,
would be to complete the impossible.

12:02.056 --> 12:04.141
No one's ever done it.

12:04.308 --> 12:06.977
Ozaki himself died
attempting his third ordeal.

12:07.645 --> 12:10.022
These guys have already
completed the first three.

12:10.898 --> 12:12.983
"Emerging Force" in Africa.

12:13.984 --> 12:15.986
"Birth of Sky" on Everest.

12:16.153 --> 12:18.197
And "Awakening Earth" in Mexico.

12:23.953 --> 12:25.538
What's number four?

12:26.163 --> 12:27.998
It's called "Life of Water."

12:29.458 --> 12:31.168
The National Weather Service

12:31.335 --> 12:33.379
is tracking a low-pressure system
in the Atlantic.

12:33.546 --> 12:35.946
<i>A massive storm about to hit off the coast
of western France.</i>

12:36.298 --> 12:38.634
<i>And when it clears,
it's gonna cause a giant swell.</i>

12:38.801 --> 12:42.179
We're talkin' once-in-a-decade waves.

12:42.346 --> 12:44.515
Eighty feet-plus.

12:44.890 --> 12:49.019
Sir, if I'm right,
that's where they'll be.

12:50.396 --> 12:52.022
You own a suit, son?

12:53.691 --> 12:56.110
<i>Before finding my way to the FBI,</i>

12:56.444 --> 12:58.696
<i>I was what's called
an Extreme Sports Poly-Athlete.</i>

12:59.029 --> 13:01.407
Snowboarding, motocross,

13:01.574 --> 13:03.033
any downhill mountain sport, really.

13:04.118 --> 13:05.161
<i>And a few up.</i>

13:05.828 --> 13:07.037
<i>Hall!</i>

13:07.288 --> 13:08.956
I'm supposed to be on a plane to Mexico
in half an hour.

13:09.123 --> 13:10.207
Why am I listening to this?

13:10.374 --> 13:11.417
Five minutes.

13:11.709 --> 13:14.128
I believe the people
behind the robberies in Mexico

13:14.295 --> 13:17.047
as well as the one in Mumbai
are extreme athletes.

13:17.423 --> 13:18.424
Isn't that obvious?

13:18.799 --> 13:21.051
I don't think
you ride a motorcycle off a building,

13:21.218 --> 13:23.018
or skydive out of a cargo plane
if you aren't.

13:23.471 --> 13:25.351
That last pair
cratered somewhere in the jungle.

13:25.723 --> 13:28.100
I don't think they went
into the jungle at all.

13:28.517 --> 13:30.561
<i>I think they went through it.</i>

13:32.229 --> 13:33.564
Cave of the Swallows.

13:33.731 --> 13:36.484
<i>This is the largest
natural cave shaft on Earth.</i>

13:36.817 --> 13:39.320
The Empire State Building
could literally fit inside it.

13:39.487 --> 13:42.656
And it just happens to be located
adjacent to San Luis Potosi.

13:43.407 --> 13:44.867
<i>The perps knew that.</i>

13:45.034 --> 13:47.661
They surgically identified
the perfect line

13:47.828 --> 13:49.163
that would intersect them with the jungle

13:49.455 --> 13:51.207
<i>exactly where they wanted.</i>

13:51.373 --> 13:54.335
<i>In doing so,
they became the first and only</i>

13:54.502 --> 13:59.048
<i>to make a sky-earth transition
into the Cave of Swallows.</i>

13:59.173 --> 14:00.758
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yeah!

14:03.219 --> 14:04.970
<i>But what is the motive
for the crimes?</i>

14:05.137 --> 14:07.097
<i>And what does this have to do
with guys driving motorcycles</i>

14:07.264 --> 14:09.475
out of diamond-sorting facilities?

14:09.642 --> 14:12.645
Or raining U.S. currency
down over central Mexico?

14:13.938 --> 14:16.774
Well, sir,
that's what we need to find out.

14:24.031 --> 14:25.115
Those people in there,

14:26.325 --> 14:27.952
<i>they didn't buy your theory.</i>

14:31.288 --> 14:32.498
But I did.

14:36.460 --> 14:38.963
This is a provisional I.D.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.799
You're on your way to France.

14:41.966 --> 14:46.053
You'll be met there by Agent Pappas
out of the U.K. office.

14:46.804 --> 14:47.805
Now, he's...

14:49.139 --> 14:52.643
...an acquired taste,
but you can trust him.

14:52.810 --> 14:55.813
I want you to do exactly as he says,
you understand?

14:56.647 --> 14:57.690
Yes, sir.

14:58.190 --> 15:00.150
Your job, identify these individuals,

15:00.526 --> 15:04.280
<i>find out what the connection is
between the crimes and the ordeals.</i>

15:04.446 --> 15:05.906
Yes, sir.

15:06.073 --> 15:09.451
Don't let me down,
'cause my ass is on the line in this.

15:10.536 --> 15:12.663
I don't plan on it, sir.

15:21.130 --> 15:23.424
Surfing? In the middle of the ocean?

15:23.591 --> 15:25.884
Yeah, the storm causes a swell.

15:26.051 --> 15:28.846
It travels thousands of miles
through deep water,

15:29.179 --> 15:30.723
then suddenly reaches an
underwater mountain, and it...

15:30.889 --> 15:33.684
Load your shit. It's time to roll.

15:49.575 --> 15:53.871
So, by your,
for lack of a better word, <i>"hypothesis,"</i>

15:54.038 --> 15:55.873
if these guys exist, they'd be out here?

15:56.582 --> 15:59.501
Freak spring swell like this,
there's no way they'd miss it.

15:59.668 --> 16:01.003
No one knows
when the next one's gonna hit.

16:01.253 --> 16:03.839
It could be Cortes Bank in a year,
or maybe five, maybe 10.

16:04.381 --> 16:06.008
It's a needle in a haystack after this.

16:06.592 --> 16:08.927
Congrats. You found your haystack.

17:57.244 --> 17:59.037
Pick up, pick up!

18:46.335 --> 18:47.878
You ever surf anything like this?

18:48.796 --> 18:49.838
I've surfed.

18:50.005 --> 18:52.090
Yeah, but you ever surfed
anything like this?

18:56.470 --> 18:58.597
Are you ready? Let's go!

18:58.931 --> 19:00.557
Here comes the set of the day!

19:01.558 --> 19:03.060
Oh, shit.

19:33.215 --> 19:35.592
Look! There's two guys
going for the same wave!

19:35.884 --> 19:37.636
Who's got the inside?

19:47.312 --> 19:49.773
- What the hell, man?
- Back, man! It's not your wave!

19:54.403 --> 19:55.988
They got it!

19:57.948 --> 20:00.033
That guy, he's snaking the wave!

20:07.749 --> 20:09.269
You're gonna get somebody killed, man!

20:09.334 --> 20:10.961
What's going on?

21:05.349 --> 21:07.476
♪ ♪

21:15.692 --> 21:18.946
<i>So, the old train station in Paris,
tomorrow night.</i>

21:19.488 --> 21:21.073
You gonna jump in this time?

21:21.239 --> 21:24.076
<i>I'm still hurting
from the last one.</i>

21:27.955 --> 21:30.707
- You're the guy I snaked, right?
- Yup.

21:30.874 --> 21:32.754
And the one who
plucked you off the ocean floor.

21:34.711 --> 21:37.047
I guess you never surfed anything
that big before, right?

21:37.547 --> 21:39.675
- Has anybody?
- He almost did.

21:40.550 --> 21:41.551
<i>Almost.</i>

21:41.718 --> 21:42.719
Sorry.

21:43.679 --> 21:46.098
You didn't make the choice for me. I did.

21:47.975 --> 21:49.810
So, he's alive? Shame.

21:51.144 --> 21:53.313
Easy, Roach.
Don't you know who our guest is?

21:53.981 --> 21:55.065
Who is it?

21:55.315 --> 21:56.316
Johnny Utah.

21:57.734 --> 21:58.860
"Roach" Rottinger, right?

22:00.779 --> 22:01.822
You're a moto legend, man.

22:02.906 --> 22:04.658
Come on, chill out.

22:07.911 --> 22:09.037
I know who you are.

22:09.329 --> 22:11.373
What's a motocross rider
doing on a wave like that?

22:12.958 --> 22:16.086
You almost got
your own ass killed today, brother.

But it's not about risking our lives

42:05.399 --> 42:09.153
We're here to try to save this place
by becoming one with it.

49:01.773 --> 49:03.066
Means "mountain people."

49:05.444 --> 49:07.988
Maybe that's why
I was so good on the slopes.

49:10.240 --> 49:13.452
Jeff was like a brother to me.
More than a friend.

49:16.204 --> 49:17.706
And he died because of me.

49:19.791 --> 49:22.377
What happened to your friend was tragic.

49:25.881 --> 49:27.424
But it was his choice, not yours.

49:33.013 --> 49:35.766
We can only be responsible

caught up here when it does.

50:15.055 --> 50:17.766

Then what's wrong with it?

50:30.112 --> 50:31.113
It's not beautiful.

50:34.282 --> 50:37.160
That's not beautiful. That's death.

50:37.994 --> 50:41.289
Maybe. But it's also perfect.

50:52.843 --> 50:54.136
Shit...

50:56.388 --> 50:57.389
Oh!

51:01.226 --> 51:02.477

- Right.

Kind of great, isn't it?

- Your line?

What's being given back?

58:32.177 --> 58:33.344
Trust me.

58:34.596 --> 58:36.264
We give back.

58:50.570 --> 58:51.696
Do you need privacy?

No. I'm good.

Yeah, mostly.

Thinkin' about losing Chowder.

59:20.099 --> 59:22.018
If any of this party
is what Ozaki had in mind

59:22.185 --> 59:23.394
for the path to enlightenment.

59:26.606 --> 59:28.691
Ozaki would have hated this.

59:29.734 --> 59:31.945
He only cared about
the purity of The Eight

59:33.613 --> 59:35.657
and giving back whatever
he took from the Earth

59:35.823 --> 59:36.943
on the way to getting there.

59:37.825 --> 59:39.869
And what did he give back?

59:40.536 --> 59:45.208
Sometimes it was as simple
as planting a tree.

59:46.501 --> 59:50.380
Other times, it was something much larger.

59:50.964 --> 59:54.759
Like when my parents died
in an avalanche when I was nine,

59:54.926 --> 59:56.427
he gave me a home.

01:00:00.974 --> 01:00:02.517
I didn't know.

01:00:03.351 --> 01:00:05.144
<i>Sorry.</i>

01:00:07.563 --> 01:00:11.359
I know that he died
questing his third ordeal.

01:00:11.859 --> 01:00:14.696
Yeah. That's the story.

01:00:14.862 --> 01:00:16.030
But it's not the truth.

01:00:17.824 --> 01:00:19.450
He completed that ordeal.

01:00:20.702 --> 01:00:23.538
He could have finished the entire Eight.

01:00:24.205 --> 01:00:26.124
He was that good.

01:00:29.961 --> 01:00:34.716
But instead he got himself killed
giving back for that ordeal.

01:00:37.010 --> 01:00:38.094
How?

01:00:41.097 --> 01:00:45.184
He positioned his small boat
in the North Atlantic

01:00:46.227 --> 01:00:51.232
between a Norwegian whaling ship
and a pod of humpback whales.

01:00:53.609 --> 01:00:56.237
The whaling ship never even slowed.

01:00:57.739 --> 01:01:01.617
The only survivor was a young guy
who was on the boat with him.

01:01:02.535 --> 01:01:05.163
Well, why didn't
this young guy say something?

01:01:05.330 --> 01:01:06.490
Why didn't he tell the world?

01:01:07.623 --> 01:01:09.876
Maybe he had other ideas.

01:01:12.128 --> 01:01:14.630
It wouldn't have made a difference anyway.

01:01:16.924 --> 01:01:21.721
As much as I worshipped Ozaki,

01:01:22.388 --> 01:01:23.931
that was his Achilles' heel.

01:01:26.434 --> 01:01:32.440
He truly believed that
he could change the world with an idea.

01:01:34.650 --> 01:01:36.611
Ideas can be powerful.

01:01:39.489 --> 01:01:41.366
Not as powerful as a whaling ship.

01:01:47.872 --> 01:01:51.459
If not ideas, then what else is there?

01:01:53.503 --> 01:01:55.088
Action.

01:01:59.550 --> 01:02:01.386
That young guy on the boat.

01:02:03.346 --> 01:02:04.472
That was Bodhi, wasn't it?

01:02:05.598 --> 01:02:09.310
Bodhi is going to complete
what Ozaki set out to do.

01:02:10.937 --> 01:02:13.064
He's going to take
a different path to do it.

01:02:21.322 --> 01:02:23.491
So, here we are.

01:03:37.106 --> 01:03:38.399
Came as fast as I could.

01:03:38.566 --> 01:03:39.775
Yeah. It's been 12 days.

01:03:40.067 --> 01:03:42.403
I saw an opportunity.
I couldn't break cover.

01:03:43.654 --> 01:03:46.991
I put a 24-hour surveillance
on Al Fariq's hideaway.

01:03:48.075 --> 01:03:49.785
I know exactly what you were doing.

01:03:57.835 --> 01:03:59.128
Criminal masterminds?

01:03:59.921 --> 01:04:01.714
They're just kids
partying away their lives

01:04:01.881 --> 01:04:02.882
on Al Fariq's dime.

01:04:03.674 --> 01:04:05.676
The difference between them and you,

01:04:05.843 --> 01:04:07.470
is you're doing it on the FBI's.

01:04:08.554 --> 01:04:09.597
Pappas...

01:04:13.601 --> 01:04:14.852
Where does that leave you, huh?

01:04:15.019 --> 01:04:16.979
Hangin' out on this dock
while I'm onto something?

01:04:17.063 --> 01:04:18.481
You're onto shit!

01:04:18.648 --> 01:04:22.443
Now I'm sorry if this particular locale
lacks the glamour you're accustomed to

01:04:22.693 --> 01:04:23.736
because there's no drugs,

01:04:24.028 --> 01:04:25.696
or naked girls shakin' their arses.

01:04:26.364 --> 01:04:28.533
But that's why we stayed down
'ere all night.

01:04:28.699 --> 01:04:31.744
To prove that wasn't an American mine
that blew that piece of shit up!

01:04:32.203 --> 01:04:35.957
For your information,
this is how the real FBI works.

01:04:36.541 --> 01:04:41.837
It's dirty, it's pedestrian,
and generally downright boring!

01:04:42.547 --> 01:04:44.757
I can figure this out, Pappas!

01:04:45.758 --> 01:04:47.385
I just need more time.

01:05:02.525 --> 01:05:03.526
You've been gone a day.

01:05:03.985 --> 01:05:05.145
Where the fuck have you been?

01:05:07.071 --> 01:05:08.823
<i>Ready to start talkin'
about giving back?</i>

01:05:18.916 --> 01:05:20.126
She gives.

01:05:20.293 --> 01:05:21.460
We partake.

01:05:21.627 --> 01:05:23.337
And then we give her an offering.

01:05:23.504 --> 01:05:25.464
An offering of what?

01:05:25.631 --> 01:05:27.174
<i>That mine down there</i>

01:05:27.466 --> 01:05:30.177
has been ripping gold out of her guts
for over 20 years.

01:05:30.970 --> 01:05:33.055
<i>We're gonna get some of it back for her.</i>

01:05:40.771 --> 01:05:42.440
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, my man.

01:05:42.690 --> 01:05:43.816
Source to source.

01:05:45.443 --> 01:05:46.485
You're gonna steal it?

01:05:47.069 --> 01:05:48.112
No.

01:05:50.031 --> 01:05:51.574
We're going to liberate it.

01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:11.761
When's this goin' down?

01:06:13.971 --> 01:06:15.097
Right now, brother.

01:06:32.907 --> 01:06:35.785
I get it, okay?
People are screwing up the world.

01:06:36.077 --> 01:06:38.287
And you wanna do something about it,
then you gotta find another way!

01:06:38.454 --> 01:06:39.455
The world is burning! Look around!

01:06:39.622 --> 01:06:41.248
- Do you have a better idea?
<i>- There's about a hundred ways</i>

01:06:41.457 --> 01:06:43.125
this could go really wrong, man.

01:06:43.417 --> 01:06:44.418
Explosives like that...

01:06:45.294 --> 01:06:47.463
<i>You're gonna cross a line
you can't come back from.</i>

01:06:47.672 --> 01:06:49.090
That's the difference between us.

01:06:49.423 --> 01:06:50.424
<i>All you see is lines.</i>

01:06:51.634 --> 01:06:53.260
We see the truth.

01:06:54.887 --> 01:06:56.389
Put that on.

01:07:51.527 --> 01:07:53.195
Stay behind me!

01:08:14.717 --> 01:08:15.843
No, no!

01:08:37.323 --> 01:08:38.573
- Get outta here!
- Get out!

01:08:38.741 --> 01:08:40.117

01:08:45.456 --> 01:08:47.332
Leave the truck! Run! Run!

01:08:47.917 --> 01:08:49.667
Come on, Johnny!

01:09:00.888 --> 01:09:02.430
All set.

01:09:12.107 --> 01:09:16.069
Get out! Get out! Get out of there!

01:09:16.237 --> 01:09:18.072
<i>Get out!</i>

01:09:21.283 --> 01:09:23.661
Help me! Gimme a hand! Help me!

01:09:24.995 --> 01:09:26.037
Put him down here.

01:09:30.251 --> 01:09:32.169
Bodhi, freeze, FBI!

01:09:33.587 --> 01:09:34.921
I can't let you do it, brother!

01:09:37.925 --> 01:09:39.760
Damn it, Bodhi, drop that!

01:09:54.274 --> 01:09:56.235
That's it. We gotta get outta here!
Let's go!

01:10:58.422 --> 01:11:00.507
It was you the whole time!

01:11:01.383 --> 01:11:04.470
Mumbai, Africa, Mexico. Everything!

01:11:05.012 --> 01:11:08.015
If you really wanted to know,
all you had to do was ask.

01:11:59.441 --> 01:12:01.151
When you showed up in Paris,

01:12:02.653 --> 01:12:03.696
we knew you were a cop.

01:12:04.738 --> 01:12:06.073
Then why'd you let me in?

01:12:07.825 --> 01:12:10.244
Because I thought I could save you.

01:12:32.766 --> 01:12:34.226
That's when I lost control
of the motorcycle

01:12:34.393 --> 01:12:36.228
and crashed into the river.

01:12:37.604 --> 01:12:40.441
By the time I got back to the surface
and the riverbank,

01:12:42.651 --> 01:12:43.736
he was gone.

01:12:51.285 --> 01:12:53.954
Your orders were
to investigate and report.

01:12:55.122 --> 01:12:57.458
So, now I got another situation.

01:12:58.584 --> 01:13:01.628
$100 million in gold ore
lost from Grauman Minerals,

01:13:01.795 --> 01:13:04.423
which as you know,
is another multi-national

01:13:04.590 --> 01:13:06.508
with American ties.

01:13:06.675 --> 01:13:10.888
And I got the Director on my ass
sending me here from D.C. to end this.

01:13:11.055 --> 01:13:12.639
So, my question...

01:13:14.058 --> 01:13:17.352
Why did you not follow
your instructions, son?

01:13:17.519 --> 01:13:19.146
I'd earned their trust, sir,
and I wanted to be sure

01:13:19.313 --> 01:13:21.023
they were the suspects.

01:13:21.190 --> 01:13:24.234
So, your M.O. is to help them
commit another crime?

01:13:24.568 --> 01:13:26.820
No! Not at all. I wanted to stop them.

01:13:26.987 --> 01:13:29.031
- Yeah...
- I tried to stop them.

01:13:30.115 --> 01:13:32.910
Bodhi doesn't see these as crimes.

01:13:33.077 --> 01:13:35.162
He thinks of them as offerings.

01:13:35.454 --> 01:13:37.081
Offerings? What the hell does that mean?

01:13:37.331 --> 01:13:39.708
What the hell does that even mean?

01:13:40.084 --> 01:13:42.753
These guys are trying
to complete the Ozaki Eight.

01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:45.756
They see that as a gift given to them
from the Earth.

01:13:45.923 --> 01:13:47.549
To balance out that gift,
they want to give back

01:13:47.716 --> 01:13:48.759
something taken from the Earth.

01:13:48.926 --> 01:13:51.326
This case, it was gold ore
that was ripped out of the ground.

01:13:54.264 --> 01:13:55.984
Now you've been undercover,
what, two weeks?

01:13:56.558 --> 01:13:58.727
<i>You know how easy it is
to lose perspective, son?</i>

01:13:59.853 --> 01:14:03.398
What happened here,
you got too close to these individuals.

01:14:03.565 --> 01:14:05.943
You did exactly what I told you not to do!

01:14:06.902 --> 01:14:10.197
I wanna catch these guys, sir.
Just like you.

01:14:11.406 --> 01:14:14.034
<i>But they're not common criminals.
They just don't see themselves that way.</i>

01:14:14.201 --> 01:14:16.036
<i>They've taken Ozaki's ideas
to the extreme.</i>

01:14:16.537 --> 01:14:19.331
They think they're crusaders
with a worthy cause.

01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:21.640
They're more than willing to die for it.

01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:25.587
Every criminal has some
bullshit justification for what they do.

01:14:26.130 --> 01:14:28.090
<i>And just like every other
identified criminal,</i>

01:14:28.423 --> 01:14:30.843
their profiles are here at Interpol.

01:14:31.009 --> 01:14:32.928
They will make a move,
and we will catch them.

01:14:33.637 --> 01:14:35.639
<i>We've frozen Al Fariq's assets.</i>

01:14:35.806 --> 01:14:36.932
<i>Their money is gone.</i>

01:14:37.099 --> 01:14:38.139
<i>These guys are meticulous.</i>

01:14:39.393 --> 01:14:41.603
Everything they do is near flawless.

01:14:42.729 --> 01:14:44.089
<i>But if we push them into a corner,</i>

01:14:44.314 --> 01:14:46.650
<i>they will act like common criminals.</i>

01:14:48.235 --> 01:14:50.070
And it will get ugly.

01:14:53.323 --> 01:14:55.701
Ugly is what we do, son.

01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:00.622
- Sir?
- Yes?

01:15:00.956 --> 01:15:02.541
I think you should see this.

01:15:11.758 --> 01:15:13.594
Coming through frame any second...

01:15:14.011 --> 01:15:15.345
- There!
<i>- That's them.</i>

01:15:16.180 --> 01:15:18.765
Bodhi's gonna finish what Ozaki started,
no matter what.

01:15:19.099 --> 01:15:20.559
<i>But he needs money to do that.</i>

01:15:21.226 --> 01:15:24.104
We've frozen their assets.
They can't do a damn thing.

01:15:27.274 --> 01:15:29.276
Hugh, how many banks are in the area?

01:15:29.776 --> 01:15:30.986
There's more than a dozen.

01:15:31.695 --> 01:15:33.572
<i>But this is Saturday, none are open.</i>

01:15:33.947 --> 01:15:36.658
Except a small branch
on top of the mountain.

01:15:36.825 --> 01:15:38.985
But no one would be crazy enough
to try anything there.

01:15:39.203 --> 01:15:40.287
These guys would be.

01:15:43.081 --> 01:15:44.249
It's on top of a mountain.

01:15:45.167 --> 01:15:48.670
Only one road, up or down.
A total chokepoint.

01:15:48.837 --> 01:15:50.317
Chokepoint is exactly what they want.

01:15:51.048 --> 01:15:53.300
Alert local law enforcement.

01:15:54.551 --> 01:15:58.305
It's time to choose whose side you're on.

01:16:09.149 --> 01:16:11.401
I'm not officially doin' this.

01:16:11.652 --> 01:16:14.529
I don't want you
dyin' on my watch, so don't.

01:16:49.147 --> 01:16:50.524
Bodhi!

01:16:52.234 --> 01:16:54.111
No! Hold your fire!

01:16:59.032 --> 01:17:00.450
<i>Hold your fire!</i>

01:18:07.434 --> 01:18:08.727
Ah!

01:18:24.284 --> 01:18:25.285
Move!

01:18:25.827 --> 01:18:27.079
Cut 'im off!

01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:53.021
<i>Bodhi!</i>

01:19:28.807 --> 01:19:30.559
Bodhi, no! No!

01:20:42.756 --> 01:20:44.591
That's one hell of a bucket list.

01:20:46.468 --> 01:20:48.303
<i>Why isn't number four crossed off?</i>

01:20:48.637 --> 01:20:50.430
I thought he surfed the wave.

01:20:52.682 --> 01:20:54.768
He chose to save my life instead.

01:20:55.644 --> 01:20:56.645
Yeah.

01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:01.066
Are you okay?

01:21:01.358 --> 01:21:02.943
Yeah.

01:21:03.693 --> 01:21:05.779
Nobody said it was gonna be an easy job.

01:21:11.660 --> 01:21:14.162
Oh, God.

01:23:10.904 --> 01:23:12.280
I know where he's goin'.

01:23:13.865 --> 01:23:17.243
The first six ordeals
all travel in one direction, down.

01:23:17.952 --> 01:23:19.079
<i>With gravity.</i>

01:23:19.496 --> 01:23:22.791
But Seven, "Master of Six Lives,"
asks you to go against gravity, go up.

01:23:24.084 --> 01:23:25.669
Free solo rock climbing.

01:23:26.294 --> 01:23:29.172
And no ropes, no protection,
no second chances.

01:23:30.465 --> 01:23:32.342
Now, there are just a handful
of ascents in the world

01:23:32.509 --> 01:23:34.052
that match Ozaki's standard
for the impossible,

01:23:34.219 --> 01:23:36.859
but only one that lies outside
of the reach of the U.S. government.

01:23:38.431 --> 01:23:40.183
Angel Falls, Venezuela.

01:23:44.771 --> 01:23:47.107
It's also the country
that Bodhi was born in.

01:23:48.358 --> 01:23:49.442
Very smart.

01:23:49.609 --> 01:23:50.610
Excuse me, sir. There is a call for you.

01:23:50.777 --> 01:23:52.028
I'll call him back.

01:23:52.195 --> 01:23:54.447
We have no diplomatic
relationships with Venezuela.

01:23:54.614 --> 01:23:57.325
We have no extradition treaty
with Venezuela.

01:23:58.702 --> 01:24:00.787
We get this son-of-a-bitch
when he pops up next.

01:24:01.204 --> 01:24:02.288
<i>So, look,</i>

01:24:02.622 --> 01:24:05.875
if he survives this next ordeal,
he's got two left, correct?

01:24:06.543 --> 01:24:07.585
That's right, sir.

01:24:07.794 --> 01:24:11.339
But the wave like the one off France
is incredibly rare.

01:24:12.465 --> 01:24:15.510
It could be years until
there's a swell that size again.

01:24:15.677 --> 01:24:17.958
And the 8th Ordeal,
"Act of Ultimate Trust," is a mystery.

01:24:18.388 --> 01:24:19.472
<i>No one knows what it means.</i>

01:24:19.806 --> 01:24:22.475
I need to get to Bodhi in the 7th Ordeal
before he starts to climb.

01:24:22.642 --> 01:24:23.727
Otherwise he is gone.

01:24:24.853 --> 01:24:26.479
We can't even get into the country.

01:24:26.813 --> 01:24:28.773
I will not let this go, sir.

01:24:29.649 --> 01:24:31.317
Do you understand? He's out of reach.

01:24:35.739 --> 01:24:38.199
I make mistakes. Now, I know that.

01:24:38.700 --> 01:24:41.327
But I promised you I could do this job.

01:24:42.954 --> 01:24:44.122
I need to finish it.

01:24:48.334 --> 01:24:49.878
Pap,

01:24:51.337 --> 01:24:52.464
can we get him in?

01:24:55.341 --> 01:24:56.551
Yeah, it could be done.

01:25:33.630 --> 01:25:35.507
- Hey. This it?
<i>- Si.</i>

01:25:56.903 --> 01:25:59.906
Try not to get yourself killed, kid.

01:26:14.128 --> 01:26:15.380
<i>Bodhi, I can't see the line.</i>

01:26:16.673 --> 01:26:17.715
Nothing.

01:26:18.591 --> 01:26:19.592
I do.

01:26:21.177 --> 01:26:23.847
I do see it, and it's beautiful.

01:26:26.724 --> 01:26:29.477
You know I always trusted you, right?

01:26:29.644 --> 01:26:32.480
To follow a line I can't even see?

01:26:33.606 --> 01:26:36.067
It's not my line. It's yours.

01:26:54.335 --> 01:26:55.670
<i>Bodhi!</i>

01:26:56.421 --> 01:26:57.672
It's over!

01:26:58.464 --> 01:27:00.216
Shit!

01:28:11.329 --> 01:28:12.330
Shit!

01:28:13.331 --> 01:28:16.084
Shit!

01:28:19.128 --> 01:28:20.129
<i>Come on!</i>

01:28:20.463 --> 01:28:23.174
You can get it! Go for it!

01:28:28.221 --> 01:28:29.263
You can do it.

01:28:33.685 --> 01:28:35.687
<i>Hey, Grommet, come on.</i>

01:28:43.736 --> 01:28:44.821
See you soon.

01:28:55.415 --> 01:28:56.791
You've got nowhere to go!

01:30:56.786 --> 01:30:58.746
<i>Do you have any idea
how many laws you've broken?</i>

01:30:58.913 --> 01:31:00.039
<i>How many people you killed?</i>

01:31:02.375 --> 01:31:04.585
And you accomplished nothing.

01:31:06.420 --> 01:31:07.463
Maybe.

01:31:10.424 --> 01:31:11.968
But I'm not done yet.

01:31:13.719 --> 01:31:14.887
Bodhi! No!

01:31:15.596 --> 01:31:17.056
No!

01:32:09.984 --> 01:32:13.196
No gear, no shoes, no body, nothin'.

01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:16.490
Probably miles downriver by now.

01:32:16.991 --> 01:32:19.118
<i>Might never find the body.</i>

01:32:20.369 --> 01:32:21.746
"The Act of Ultimate Trust:"

01:32:22.747 --> 01:32:24.457
<i>Bodhi went over the falls on purpose.</i>

01:32:25.791 --> 01:32:27.335
"The 8th Ordeal."

01:32:27.793 --> 01:32:29.587
<i>He figured it out.</i>

01:32:31.797 --> 01:32:33.633
Had it fast-tracked.

01:33:52.545 --> 01:33:54.422
I guess this is really
a small world, isn't it?

01:33:54.964 --> 01:33:57.004
I just knew if you were alive
anywhere on the Earth,

01:33:57.091 --> 01:33:58.509
there's no way you'd let this go.

01:33:58.884 --> 01:33:59.969
"Life of Water."

01:34:00.386 --> 01:34:02.471
<i>It's the last ordeal you need
to complete The Eight.</i>

01:34:04.181 --> 01:34:05.224
Why are you here, Utah?

01:34:05.725 --> 01:34:08.561
It's 100-foot out there. More.

01:34:08.978 --> 01:34:10.021
You got no PFD.

01:34:10.396 --> 01:34:13.274
You're 150 miles from shore.
I'm here to take you in,

01:34:13.441 --> 01:34:15.943
because if you go out there,
you're not comin' back, Bodhi!

01:34:16.444 --> 01:34:18.487
And isn't that beautiful?

01:34:20.781 --> 01:34:22.992
Isn't that beautiful?

01:34:31.250 --> 01:34:32.877
Isn't that beautiful, brother?

01:34:35.421 --> 01:34:37.131
This is my path.

01:34:39.759 --> 01:34:41.927
Let me complete it.

01:34:55.149 --> 01:34:56.400
See you soon, Utah.

01:37:30.304 --> 01:37:31.388
<i>Where to?</i>

01:37:36.977 --> 01:37:38.771
Home.
