00:47.839 --> 00:48.965
Thank you.

01:51.527 --> 01:52.820
Hello?

01:53.321 --> 01:55.531
Yes, a few minutes ago.

01:55.615 --> 01:58.868
No, there wasn't any first class
on that flight.

02:00.328 --> 02:02.413
What do you mean prima donna?

02:02.496 --> 02:05.416
I'm the best. Right.

02:06.250 --> 02:08.627
You bet I fly first class.

02:09.836 --> 02:13.007
Yeah, I got the pictures.
But those people are your problems.

02:13.090 --> 02:17.303
The deal is you take care of your end,
and I'll take care of mine.

02:17.386 --> 02:19.513
And everybody will be happy.

02:19.597 --> 02:24.268
In other words, I don't move
until that Prince woman is eliminated.

04:35.315 --> 04:36.899
- Plotkin?
- Right.

04:37.316 --> 04:41.320
What is this information that
is supposed to be so vital to the IADC?

04:41.404 --> 04:43.364
Not here. Follow me.

05:00.506 --> 05:02.508
Get her. We've got to waste her.

06:34.141 --> 06:37.227
What did you do that for?
I didn't mean you any harm.

06:38.562 --> 06:42.357
- You call this harmless?
- So I lied.

06:53.785 --> 06:56.830
- Why were you setting up Diana Prince?
- Money.

06:58.081 --> 07:01.418
I hope you saved it. This is your rainy day.

07:08.341 --> 07:12.929
Well, whoever this Plotkin character is,
his personal effects don't tell us much.

07:13.012 --> 07:16.641
It's like he was a no-good drifter
who'd sell his mother for a buck.

07:16.850 --> 07:20.728
Wonder Woman used her lasso.
But all he could tell her was that...

07:20.895 --> 07:23.690
he was hired by the other two
to help take me out.

07:23.773 --> 07:25.942
- And the other two?
- Got away.

07:28.611 --> 07:30.613
What do you make of this?

07:31.281 --> 07:32.532
Found in his wallet.

07:32.615 --> 07:36.119
"Sir: This will confirm demolition
of CARl as requested.

07:36.202 --> 07:39.872
"My people will move on their respective
assignments with all due speed.

07:39.956 --> 07:43.793
"Completion guaranteed
before 9:30 a. m., 26th.

07:44.460 --> 07:45.670
"W.N."

07:46.963 --> 07:51.008
Demolition? Sounds more like
they're talking about murder to me.

07:52.135 --> 07:53.719
The 26th is tomorrow.

07:54.095 --> 07:57.014
And you must have been
one of their respective assignments.

07:57.098 --> 08:00.726
And whoever C-A-R-I stands for
is the prime target.

08:01.936 --> 08:05.398
W.N.? Woodward Nightingale?

08:07.441 --> 08:11.487
He never makes a contract unless
someone's talking at least six digits.

08:11.570 --> 08:13.197
This is certainly his style.

08:13.281 --> 08:15.616
For once, we'd have a chance
to be one up on him.

08:15.700 --> 08:18.494
If we can figure out
who the prime target is.

08:18.577 --> 08:20.663
CARl, C-A-R-I.

08:21.831 --> 08:26.377
Steve, that big industrialist who's in
Washington for the trade meetings.

08:26.961 --> 08:30.339
- Carlo...
- Indrezzano!

08:31.507 --> 08:35.553
It fits. He's certainly qualified
for a Nightingale assassination.

08:35.635 --> 08:37.888
Let me see, what did I do with that?

08:40.724 --> 08:42.308
Yeah, here it is.

08:42.393 --> 08:46.355
His full name is
Carlo Amadeo Ricardo Indrezzano.

08:46.522 --> 08:48.524
So his initials are C-A-R-I.

08:49.692 --> 08:53.696
Sounds like I'd better get myself ready
for a watchdog assignment.

08:53.862 --> 08:55.656
Yeah. But, Diana...

08:55.781 --> 08:59.702
I understand Indrezzano has
quite a reputation for being a swinger.

09:00.160 --> 09:02.329
That's what I'm preparing for.

09:02.871 --> 09:06.291
All right. But be careful,
you've already been set up once.

09:06.375 --> 09:07.835
Yeah, got you.

09:16.385 --> 09:20.806
Our swimwear for this season reflects
both new and traditional designs...

09:21.139 --> 09:25.352
utilizing many of the exciting
today fabrics, both in the wet...

09:25.435 --> 09:27.771
I wouldn't be too concerned, Carlo.

09:28.355 --> 09:30.857
Two million bushels of wheat
lost to mildew.

09:30.941 --> 09:33.777
- And I shouldn't be too concerned?
- It's unavoidable.

09:33.860 --> 09:38.031
Besides, it means we get a better price
for the remaining 10 million bushels.

09:39.032 --> 09:40.117
Yes.

09:42.619 --> 09:44.079
Of course.

09:58.593 --> 10:02.889
I want two of that one.

10:03.765 --> 10:06.393
I wouldn't want to slight my friends here.

10:12.399 --> 10:14.776
Your sense of perspective
has not diminished...

10:14.859 --> 10:17.612
in all the 14 years
we've been partners, Marius.

10:18.113 --> 10:21.991
Where I lose sight of things, you do not.

10:22.784 --> 10:25.078
That is why we are where we are.

10:25.829 --> 10:28.540
Has the oil company
changed its mind about our offer?

10:28.623 --> 10:29.833
Not yet.

10:31.668 --> 10:32.835
But it will.

10:32.919 --> 10:36.422
- Exactly.
- Get me the Prince woman.

10:36.923 --> 10:39.550
I suppose it's about time
I returned her call.

10:39.717 --> 10:44.681
The IADC has insisted
that one of their agents guard me.

10:45.264 --> 10:49.268
The least I can do is take her to lunch,
I mean, to preserve my image.

10:49.894 --> 10:52.230
- They've assigned a woman to you?
- Yes.

10:52.313 --> 10:55.775
- I can imagine what she looks like.
- I'm afraid I can, too.

10:55.858 --> 10:58.653
Probably stout...

10:59.112 --> 11:01.531
squat, and beetle-browed.

11:01.614 --> 11:03.783
- With a moustache.
- No doubt.

11:17.296 --> 11:21.342
Now that's probably
what my bodyguard will look like.

12:27.366 --> 12:31.370
Hi there, Violet. Say hello to Beamer.
He's going to be working with us.

12:32.663 --> 12:33.789
Hi.

12:35.374 --> 12:37.042
How's the typing?

12:37.709 --> 12:39.044
Don't ask.

12:40.003 --> 12:42.798
Violet used to be our number one hit lady.

12:43.173 --> 12:44.383
Hit person.

12:45.384 --> 12:48.845
And I'm thinking seriously
of getting back into the business.

12:49.221 --> 12:51.139
Well, just for one day.

12:51.223 --> 12:53.099
Find whoever it was who said that...

12:53.183 --> 12:56.978
women were cut out for office work.

12:59.064 --> 13:01.983
Listen, I think
Mr. Nightingale is expecting us.

13:04.736 --> 13:09.658
Right. You gentlemen are not going to be
wanting any coffee, are you?

13:10.158 --> 13:12.202
- No.
- That's good.

13:15.246 --> 13:17.749
The price I quoted was for three.

13:21.252 --> 13:23.588
If you want four, it'll cost you more.

13:24.547 --> 13:27.842
If that's your attitude,
I suggest you seek assistance elsewhere.

13:27.926 --> 13:29.761
I don't do business with chiselers.

13:29.844 --> 13:34.432
- This place is a trip.
- It's kind of his personal memory lane.

13:40.480 --> 13:41.898
Murder through the centuries.

13:41.981 --> 13:44.275
The state taught him
how to be an executioner.

13:44.359 --> 13:48.613
Then they stopped capital punishment,
and the only thing he knows is how to kill.

13:48.696 --> 13:51.282
Negotiations on that point
are out of the question.

13:51.366 --> 13:55.495
Half of the money in front, the balance
on delivery. Otherwise, we have no deal.

13:55.578 --> 13:58.581
- These pictures?
- Those are just some of his victims.

13:58.706 --> 14:00.500
That's for his next one.

14:00.583 --> 14:03.461
Then you agree to those terms? Good.

14:03.920 --> 14:07.256
Four it is.
You'll have a confirmation by wire.

14:22.313 --> 14:26.067
Mr. Nightingale, this is Elden Beamer,
he's from Saint Louis.

14:26.150 --> 14:27.860
- Mr. Beamer.
- Elden.

14:28.944 --> 14:33.449
Thank you, Mr. Beamer, but I prefer
to keep things on a more formal basis.

14:33.532 --> 14:35.493
Mr. Krug told me something about you.

14:35.576 --> 14:38.496
He says you have a knack
for my line of work.

14:38.704 --> 14:40.915
That's nice of you to say, Mr. Nightingale.

14:40.998 --> 14:43.876
I didn't say it, Mr. Beamer, this idiot did.

14:44.460 --> 14:46.545
- Mr. Nightingale-
- Shut up.

14:50.049 --> 14:54.011
You botched your assignment, Mr. Krug.
There's nothing more to be said.

14:56.639 --> 15:00.142
Except that it won't happen again.

15:02.102 --> 15:06.732
Dedication. Accuracy. Pride in one's work.

15:06.815 --> 15:10.319
That's what I look for,
what I demand from my people.

15:14.656 --> 15:19.203
Of course, not everyone
has my special aptitude for execution.

15:20.704 --> 15:25.375
My flare for neatness, my precision.
That takes years of training.

15:25.792 --> 15:29.254
In my case,
conveniently paid for by the state.

15:30.672 --> 15:34.801
In your case,
I'm not paying you to be trainees.

15:34.885 --> 15:38.931
I'm paying you to do a professional job.
Which, this morning, you failed to do.

15:39.014 --> 15:42.934
Look, we had Diana Prince,
but Wonder Woman showed up.

15:43.018 --> 15:47.189
That agent must be neutralized before
Mr. Starker will undertake his assignment.

15:47.272 --> 15:48.690
That's our arrangement.

15:48.774 --> 15:51.026
Okay, we'll get her, I promise.

15:51.318 --> 15:55.322
- Wonder Woman or no Wonder Woman.
- Good.

15:56.615 --> 16:00.619
Let's not hesitate to make that
no Wonder Woman, shall we?

16:29.564 --> 16:32.609
- Yes?
- We're here to repair the carpet.

16:32.901 --> 16:36.404
- My carpet? I wasn't aware...
- Here's the order.

16:38.698 --> 16:43.036
- You will be finished by lunchtime?
- Don't worry, we'll be through in an hour.

17:21.991 --> 17:25.202
- Madame or mademoiselle?
- Ms. Prince.

17:25.286 --> 17:28.956
- Is there a Mr. Indrezzano here?
- But, of course. Follow me, please.

17:34.295 --> 17:37.798
Signor Indrezzano,
your luncheon companion, Ms. Prince.

17:38.549 --> 17:39.842
Thank you.

17:45.055 --> 17:47.683
Are you going to eat standing,
Mr. Indrezzano?

17:49.685 --> 17:54.148
- You are Diana Prince?
- You were expecting me.

17:55.983 --> 17:58.652
Indeed, no. I was expecting...

18:00.571 --> 18:02.740
Never mind what I expecting.

18:03.616 --> 18:06.869
What I found was love.

18:08.412 --> 18:11.957
- Mr. Indrezzano.
- Carlo, please.

18:12.041 --> 18:15.711
Carlo, I must say
that you are everything I expected.

18:18.088 --> 18:22.843
With you as my bodyguard,
I shall remain eternally in danger.

18:25.554 --> 18:29.224
You don't look like a government agent.

18:30.309 --> 18:32.561
I left my trench coat in the cleaners.

18:33.228 --> 18:36.899
Then I shall have to keep you
out of the trenches.

18:37.232 --> 18:38.525
Definitely.

18:39.526 --> 18:41.737
Are you ready to order, signore?

18:41.820 --> 18:45.157
- I'm ready for anything.
- I'm hungry.

18:46.408 --> 18:48.035
The wine list, please.

18:59.713 --> 19:02.549
I'm supposed to be
watching you, remember?

19:12.726 --> 19:13.894
Hello.

19:15.103 --> 19:17.314
Well, I'm just fine. And you?

19:17.731 --> 19:20.400
I just wanted to get a situation report,
Mr. Starker.

19:20.483 --> 19:23.069
Time is getting short,
my client is getting anxious.

19:23.153 --> 19:26.531
So am I. But there's still Diana Prince.

19:26.740 --> 19:30.410
A mere detail. One which will be
taken care of within the hour.

19:30.493 --> 19:32.829
That's the same thing I heard yesterday.

19:33.204 --> 19:37.250
- What about this other mere detail?
- Call me at 3:30.

19:37.584 --> 19:39.878
The information you require
will be here then.

19:39.961 --> 19:43.756
Just remember, I don't move
until you chill Diana Prince.

19:43.965 --> 19:46.092
Stop making excuses, Mr. Starker...

19:46.176 --> 19:48.428
and concentrate on your end
of the arrangement.

19:48.511 --> 19:51.723
I've paid your price,
I've got a customer to satisfy.

19:51.806 --> 19:55.351
What is he, standing right there
beside you so you can look good?

19:55.435 --> 19:58.104
That's all. Don't fail to call me at 3:30.

19:58.187 --> 20:02.191
Put him on, Nightingale. I'll set him
straight about your business operations.

20:02.275 --> 20:03.401
Until this afternoon.

20:03.484 --> 20:06.946
I'll tell him who does all the work
while you take all the- Hello?

20:07.572 --> 20:10.074
You see? Everything's fine, just as I said.

20:10.158 --> 20:14.078
I'm not paying you $1 million
to watch you play businessman.

20:14.746 --> 20:17.081
Results, I want results.

20:17.415 --> 20:21.085
I'm telling you, your order will be filled
by 9:30 tomorrow morning.

20:21.919 --> 20:23.171
It better be.

20:30.303 --> 20:32.680
Or it will be my head in the basket.

20:44.025 --> 20:46.902
You better not let your shrimp
go to waste.

20:48.404 --> 20:51.198
Eating would mean
having to take my eyes off of you.

20:51.282 --> 20:52.450
I know.

20:53.284 --> 20:57.204
I never dreamed that they would
provide me with such an...

20:58.539 --> 20:59.957
exquisite escort.

21:01.292 --> 21:05.379
I'd rather you didn't regard me
as your escort. Your life is in danger.

21:05.462 --> 21:08.090
- I'm here on business.
- Nonsense.

21:08.757 --> 21:12.386
For me a beautiful woman
can mean only pleasure.

21:14.638 --> 21:15.806
Romance.

21:17.975 --> 21:19.852
- I'm sorry.
- I'll put cold water on it.

21:19.935 --> 21:22.187
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

21:22.271 --> 21:25.649
Look on the bright side.
You can finish your shrimp now.

21:38.662 --> 21:40.163
Just a moment.

21:45.627 --> 21:49.548
Pardon, Signor Indrezzano,
there is a phone call for Miss Prince.

21:49.881 --> 21:52.759
She stepped away.

21:53.844 --> 21:56.179
- I'll take the call.
- Certainly. Over there.

21:56.263 --> 21:57.347
Thank you.

22:13.530 --> 22:17.200
- This isn't Diana Prince.
- Let's take him for bait anyway.

22:22.664 --> 22:24.749
Excuse me, where is Mr. Indrezzano?

22:24.833 --> 22:27.127
Miss Prince,
he is taking a phone call for you.

22:27.210 --> 22:29.546
- Where?
- At the public phone over there.

23:42.618 --> 23:43.911
You all right?

23:50.626 --> 23:51.836
What happened?

23:51.919 --> 23:56.799
Let's just say we just cheated
the jaws of death out of a meal.

23:59.009 --> 24:02.388
You mean, you saved me?

24:04.265 --> 24:08.686
That's impossible. It's ridiculous.
You are a woman.

24:09.311 --> 24:12.898
I've been told that once or twice.
Now you're sure you're all right?

24:12.982 --> 24:14.149
Yes.

24:19.446 --> 24:23.075
I got to get back to the lady
I was having lunch with.

24:23.200 --> 24:24.952
She'll never believe this!

24:28.122 --> 24:31.667
Perfect. Perfect, Violet Louise.

24:32.751 --> 24:35.921
Except, you spelled
"sincerely" backwards again.

24:37.172 --> 24:41.093
I warned you, Woody.
I am not cut out for this kind of work.

24:42.261 --> 24:45.264
- I'd much rather-
- That's all behind you now.

24:45.347 --> 24:48.517
If anyone ever deserved retirement,
it was you.

24:49.393 --> 24:52.688
Some retirement, this is torture.

24:57.150 --> 24:58.902
Not entirely, Woody.

25:09.287 --> 25:10.455
Hello.

25:12.332 --> 25:14.543
It's for you. Starker.

25:17.003 --> 25:19.506
It's 3:30, where is the information?

25:19.840 --> 25:23.593
Listen carefully,
her name is Major Anita Finley.

25:24.261 --> 25:26.346
That is correct. Finley.

25:27.013 --> 25:29.724
She will be driving
an official army car. Green.

25:30.183 --> 25:32.352
License plate "G" 108...

25:32.477 --> 25:34.020
2135.

25:35.438 --> 25:39.442
Of course. I always get the job done.
Neatly, professionally.

25:41.403 --> 25:44.364
We shall see.
In the meantime, Mr. Starker...

25:44.781 --> 25:47.951
whatever your opinion of me, do not fail.

25:54.541 --> 25:58.378
Sounds like I should have assigned
Diana Prince to protect Diana Prince.

25:58.461 --> 26:01.839
Well, if Diana's initials were C-A-R-I,
it might make sense.

26:01.923 --> 26:05.510
If Carlo was the target, they
could have killed him at the restaurant.

26:05.593 --> 26:06.803
And they didn't.

26:06.886 --> 26:09.973
Why do we keep coming up with
questions instead of answers?

26:10.056 --> 26:12.558
I am more than prepared to tell you why.

26:12.642 --> 26:14.268
I was talking with Eve.

26:15.311 --> 26:17.105
But since you are all warmed up...

26:17.188 --> 26:21.192
we have reason to believe somebody put
a contract out on Carlo Indrezzano.

26:21.734 --> 26:24.070
Indrezzano, Carlo...

26:24.195 --> 26:26.739
Amadeo Ricardo...

26:26.906 --> 26:28.908
international industrialist.

26:29.367 --> 26:32.662
Net worth $2 billion and rising.

26:33.454 --> 26:35.915
Can you tell us
who might want to see him dead?

26:35.998 --> 26:40.253
Affirmative. If you have approximately
1 hour and 40 minutes to kill.

26:40.461 --> 26:41.629
As it were.

26:41.837 --> 26:45.299
What did we ever do to his programmers
to deserve this?

26:45.466 --> 26:49.553
So a lot of people would like to
see him dead. How about his associates?

26:49.637 --> 26:51.764
Friends, relatives, people close to him?

26:51.847 --> 26:56.602
Marius Makropolous is his
closest associate. They are partners.

26:56.894 --> 27:00.689
- Can you tell us any more about him?
- Makropolous, Marius.

27:00.940 --> 27:04.485
Business tactics highly effective
and highly unorthodox.

27:04.568 --> 27:09.281
Rumored to be solely responsible for
the stock market panic of 1959.

27:09.615 --> 27:12.868
Causing the collapse of four
of the world's largest banks.

27:12.952 --> 27:15.955
Boy, no wonder Carlo wanted to keep
him in the background.

27:16.038 --> 27:18.207
Marius could be the one
who arranged the hit.

27:18.290 --> 27:21.085
He could certainly
afford Nightingale prices.

27:21.168 --> 27:25.089
But Marius lacks a motive.
That doesn't explain the attack on Diana.

27:25.172 --> 27:27.424
Is that all the help you can give us, Ira?

27:27.508 --> 27:30.427
If that is all the help you can give me.

27:31.595 --> 27:32.888
Thanks a lot.

27:32.971 --> 27:36.600
It kind of makes you wish that
his programmers did have those initials.

27:36.683 --> 27:38.143
Amen.

28:08.674 --> 28:10.258
- Major Finley?
- Yes?

28:10.342 --> 28:13.512
Hi, I'm Phil Murray.
Steve Trevor asked me to greet you...

28:13.595 --> 28:15.347
and show you to your parking space.

28:15.430 --> 28:19.017
How very thoughtful. Major Trevor
must be as nice as I've heard he is.

28:19.101 --> 28:21.353
Nicer. You'll like him a lot.

28:21.436 --> 28:24.179
If you'll just go down to
the end and turn to the right,

28:24.214 --> 28:26.107
you'll find a space over there.

28:26.191 --> 28:27.359
Thank you.

28:42.540 --> 28:44.709
Steve, Major Anita Finley is here.

28:44.793 --> 28:48.254
- She's the new engineering officer.
- Thank you, Eve, send her in.

28:53.843 --> 28:57.972
Welcome to Washington, Major. I hope
your stay at IADC is a pleasant one.

28:58.389 --> 29:00.809
I'm looking forward to it, Major Trevor.

29:06.731 --> 29:09.567
How wonderful it is, Diana,
that my life is in danger...

29:09.651 --> 29:13.071
and is receiving such beautiful protection.

29:13.863 --> 29:17.533
You would probably change your mind
if you saw me in a trench coat.

29:17.617 --> 29:20.203
Nothing could make me change my mind
about you.

29:20.286 --> 29:22.997
Well, thank you for a very lovely evening.

29:23.206 --> 29:24.077
Good night.

29:24.079 --> 29:26.793
The best part of the
evening is still ahead.

29:26.876 --> 29:29.712
That's right. The part where I go to sleep.

29:30.671 --> 29:32.173
Are you refusing me?

29:34.383 --> 29:36.302
What an amusing girl you are.

29:38.554 --> 29:41.224
- Who is that?
- That is James Dernier.

29:41.307 --> 29:44.644
He is my replacement for the rest
of the evening. You'll like him.

29:44.727 --> 29:46.771
He looks great in a trench coat.

29:47.605 --> 29:49.440
- Good night.
- Wait.

29:50.483 --> 29:52.843
I'll pick you up here
at 8:45 in the morning.

29:52.844 --> 29:55.404
We'll play tennis, then have breakfast.

29:56.739 --> 30:00.242
Make it 9:45, my office, no breakfast,
and you've got a deal.

30:00.701 --> 30:02.411
- Good night.
- Splendid.

30:02.495 --> 30:04.080
Thanks again.

30:06.290 --> 30:09.585
Thank you, lovely lady.

30:17.843 --> 30:21.013
- Some more coffee, Major?
- No more, thank you.

30:21.680 --> 30:22.848
Come in.

30:23.224 --> 30:25.768
These are the plans for the building
you asked for.

30:25.851 --> 30:27.519
Here, Corporal, I'll sign for them.

30:27.603 --> 30:29.271
Take a look here.

30:30.856 --> 30:33.233
Got the plans for the ductwork...

30:33.317 --> 30:36.445
wiring diagrams, masonry specs. That's it.

30:40.574 --> 30:42.576
There you are, Corporal. Thank you.

30:42.659 --> 30:44.912
- And there you are, Major.
- Wonderful.

30:47.247 --> 30:50.751
Thanks for the hospitality, Steve.
But I think I better get to work.

30:50.834 --> 30:53.086
It's a shame you had to start work so late.

30:53.170 --> 30:56.048
It's the only way we're going
to get things done in time.

30:56.131 --> 30:58.217
- I suppose so.
- Good night, Steve.

35:52.592 --> 35:55.928
You were on your way in to see
Woodward Nightingale, weren't you?

35:56.012 --> 35:58.598
- How do I get to him?
- Through there.

35:59.265 --> 36:02.393
Pull a light bulb. His office is downstairs.

36:03.060 --> 36:04.270
Thank you.

36:06.856 --> 36:08.232
Here we go.

36:10.109 --> 36:15.072
Get in. Remain immobile
until the police come for you.

37:05.789 --> 37:07.499
Have you an appointment?

37:14.798 --> 37:17.217
That's hardly the way
to treat a walk-in customer.

37:17.301 --> 37:19.886
And that's hardly the way
to treat my receptionist.

37:19.970 --> 37:22.973
I could have stopped her, Woody,
if I'd been wearing my gun.

37:23.056 --> 37:24.933
That's quite all right, Violet Louise.

37:25.017 --> 37:29.646
- Woodward Nightingale. Cage and all.
- What you've left of it.

37:29.980 --> 37:33.483
Please, come in. We'll have a chat.

37:42.242 --> 37:44.536
There's really nothing to chat about.

37:45.453 --> 37:48.665
I'm afraid you've drawn up
your last contract, Nightingale.

37:48.748 --> 37:50.125
What a pity.

37:50.542 --> 37:53.253
My brilliant career over, just like that.

37:54.754 --> 37:59.092
You should have ended that career when
you were laid off your job as executioner.

37:59.175 --> 38:01.386
And let all that knowledge go to waste?

38:01.469 --> 38:03.680
That would have been criminal.

38:04.264 --> 38:08.476
Just tell me who the latest person is
scheduled for demolition.

38:08.560 --> 38:10.478
All in due time, Wonder Woman.

38:11.104 --> 38:14.858
A picture of that unfortunate person
will grace that empty frame.

38:18.820 --> 38:21.990
I'm really interested
in your gallery of victims.

38:22.615 --> 38:25.076
But you ought to be interested in this one.

38:25.159 --> 38:29.706
It is, it has for quite some time
been intended for you.

38:50.143 --> 38:51.352
Come on.

38:54.397 --> 38:58.109
Now that we've all had our fun,
the games are over.

39:00.486 --> 39:04.240
- Who is supposed to be hit?
- I...

39:09.578 --> 39:12.748
All right. You have me.

39:14.083 --> 39:16.252
But I have the satisfaction of knowing...

39:16.335 --> 39:18.879
you will be unable to prevent my latest...

39:18.963 --> 39:22.258
and greatest victim
from getting its just reward.

39:23.718 --> 39:27.847
- Its? What are you talking about?
- Marius Makropolous hired me.

39:28.889 --> 39:32.852
- Right. To kill Carlo Indrezzano.
- Wrong.

39:35.229 --> 39:38.315
We know it is someone
with the initials C-A-R-I.

39:39.900 --> 39:43.445
No, my dear. You see...

39:43.529 --> 39:46.573
my reluctant secretary, Violet Louise...

39:46.657 --> 39:48.951
suffers from a form of dyslexia.

39:49.910 --> 39:53.330
She frequently spells things backwards.

39:54.915 --> 39:58.419
Backwards. I.R.A.C.?

39:58.669 --> 40:00.879
You're hired to destroy a computer-

40:00.963 --> 40:02.756
- For $1 million.
- Why?

40:02.923 --> 40:05.175
Like many of my victims,
it knew too much.

40:05.259 --> 40:07.803
It was inadvertently programmed
with information...

40:07.886 --> 40:10.305
which would have exposed
a plot to ruin Carlo...

40:10.389 --> 40:13.225
and leave Marius in control
of their business empire.

40:13.308 --> 40:16.728
The computer
would have revealed Marius' plot...

40:17.354 --> 40:20.774
at its regular readout
on Thursday morning, the 26th.

40:21.733 --> 40:23.110
At 9:30.

40:23.443 --> 40:25.529
- That's this morning.
- Correct.

41:05.318 --> 41:08.196
- Who did you hire to make the hit?
- A man named Starker.

41:08.279 --> 41:11.991
But to know his name will do you no good.
He's a master of disguise.

41:12.534 --> 41:15.161
That right, Wonder Woman.
Only four minutes.

41:15.245 --> 41:17.288
When you broke through
my security doors...

41:17.372 --> 41:19.249
you destroyed all our telephone lines.

41:19.332 --> 41:21.417
Do you know how far
we are from Washington?

41:21.501 --> 41:25.129
- I'd say 40 miles.
-47, to be exact.

41:25.964 --> 41:30.969
- Hold your wings for a while, Nightingale.
- It is you who needs wings.

41:31.636 --> 41:34.514
You have four minutes to travel 47 miles.

41:35.098 --> 41:38.351
Only four minutes. And counting.

41:42.480 --> 41:45.483
I bet you never see her
behind a typewriter.

43:25.332 --> 43:28.460
Ms. Prince doesn't seem to be
in the building just now, sir.

43:28.543 --> 43:31.171
Perhaps you'd like to wait
over there for her.

43:32.214 --> 43:33.298
Thank you.

44:06.706 --> 44:09.793
Excuse me.
Steve, you've all got to stay out.

44:09.876 --> 44:13.338
Steve, I want you to clear the area,
and shut this door behind me!

44:13.421 --> 44:15.298
All right, get back, everyone!

45:07.391 --> 45:11.729
Good morning, please stand by
for my 9:30 a. m. readout.

45:12.605 --> 45:17.360
The areas of concern today are
foreign and domestic security...

45:17.777 --> 45:20.529
military operation in the European sector.

45:37.004 --> 45:39.673
- Here, allow me.
- It's all right.

45:40.091 --> 45:41.592
- No.
- I insist.

45:51.227 --> 45:54.521
You know, Major, you really ought to
change your hairstyle.

45:55.898 --> 45:58.442
Something like this. Gentlemen.

46:04.406 --> 46:07.493
And we found the real Major Finley
in the trunk of her car.

46:07.576 --> 46:10.079
- A little stiff, but okay.
- That's good.

46:10.662 --> 46:15.250
I take it, Marius Makropolous
did not enjoy Ira's 9:30 readout?

46:15.375 --> 46:16.502
No.

46:16.585 --> 46:20.172
How could my partner,
my good friend, do such a thing?

46:20.297 --> 46:22.633
It has to do with greed, Carlo.

46:22.966 --> 46:25.844
Sometimes, you can't trust
even your friends.

46:27.346 --> 46:30.432
Carlo, have you seen a doctor
about that shiner?

46:31.058 --> 46:33.769
It's nothing. I bumped into a door.

46:35.812 --> 46:37.064
I know.

46:37.439 --> 46:41.485
- Don't feel too badly, I was fooled myself.
- I was not fooled.

46:41.735 --> 46:43.278
Not even for a moment.

46:43.362 --> 46:47.908
Would you have captured that dangerous
assassin had I not risked my very life?

46:48.241 --> 46:52.287
Of course not, Carlo. We are very grateful.

46:53.580 --> 46:56.416
I want no publicity, please.

46:56.708 --> 46:58.793
Bravery is its own reward.

47:02.130 --> 47:06.092
I would like to express my gratitude
to Wonder Woman.

47:07.594 --> 47:10.597
Would you give her this for me, please?

47:13.224 --> 47:16.102
That's very generous of you.
I don't think she'd take it.

47:16.186 --> 47:19.481
Besides, we never know
when she's going to be around again.

47:21.066 --> 47:22.901
Well, in that case...

47:23.818 --> 47:26.988
I'd like you to have it.
Take it, it's yours.

47:27.405 --> 47:28.656
Take it.

47:33.787 --> 47:38.291
That's very nice of you, Carlo,
but I can't take it either. Thanks anyway.

47:39.167 --> 47:41.127
I don't believe it.

47:41.586 --> 47:45.173
For the first time,
I can't even give a diamond away.

47:46.507 --> 47:50.386
Well, we've all seen
enough shining things for one day.

48:34.930 --> 48:35.973
