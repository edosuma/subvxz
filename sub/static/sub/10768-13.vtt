15:01.290 --> 15:04.780
First numbness,
then the sensation of needles on skin...

15:04.960 --> 15:07.260
...finally, right before death,
violent spasms...

15:07.430 --> 15:09.760
...as your blood freezes
and your heart locks up.

15:10.400 --> 15:13.230
No more Discovery Channel for you, man.

15:16.970 --> 15:18.840
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

15:19.010 --> 15:21.600
- What Carlton, what? What?
- No, no, no!

15:21.780 --> 15:24.140
What, Carlton, violent spasms?
Tell me what to do.

15:24.310 --> 15:27.370
I didn't get the insurance.

15:31.650 --> 15:34.210
- What?
- I put the car on my credit card...

15:34.390 --> 15:36.590
<i>...and I didn't get the $6 insurance.</i>

15:36.760 --> 15:39.350
You always wonder why they ask you
to sign that waiver.

15:39.530 --> 15:41.520
Well, there it is.

15:47.200 --> 15:49.070
I don't know what's worse.

15:49.240 --> 15:55.180
Dying a slow agonizing death
or staying alive and listening to you.

16:03.020 --> 16:05.080
Damn, it's cold.

16:08.420 --> 16:09.450
You know, Will?

16:12.330 --> 16:14.800
I don't have any friends.

16:17.430 --> 16:21.060
What are you talking about, Carlton?
You got plenty of friends, man.

16:23.170 --> 16:25.730
You think people are your friends...

16:25.980 --> 16:29.380
...but they're only that
because of what you can do for them.

16:31.210 --> 16:32.510
Except you, Will.

16:33.850 --> 16:35.980
I don't do anything for you.

16:38.420 --> 16:40.720
Even when you make fun of me...

16:41.260 --> 16:43.560
...I know you're doing it out of love.

16:46.130 --> 16:48.650
You haven't been doing that
as much lately.

16:49.700 --> 16:51.500
What are you talking about, Carlton?

16:51.670 --> 16:54.470
I just called you Thumbelina
this morning.

16:56.110 --> 16:58.840
Yeah, but your heart wasn't in it.

16:59.840 --> 17:02.440
Look, Carlton...

17:03.250 --> 17:04.839
...let me tell you something, man.

17:05.010 --> 17:10.480
Lisa, that's my girlfriend
and we're gonna be together, man.

17:10.650 --> 17:13.619
But that doesn't change the fact
that you're my best friend.

17:16.829 --> 17:18.520
Stumpy.

17:20.430 --> 17:23.420
I'd cry, but my tear ducts are frozen.

17:26.240 --> 17:29.170
You know what?
I ain't going out like this.

17:30.040 --> 17:34.070
All right, look, I figure if I can hit this slope
at the perfect angle...

17:34.240 --> 17:36.710
...I could ski down and get us some help.

17:36.880 --> 17:39.040
Look, Will,
I'm a much better skier than you.

17:39.210 --> 17:42.180
- Let me go.
- Go ahead.

17:43.790 --> 17:45.550
You'd let me jump like that?

17:45.720 --> 17:50.350
Hey, hey, hey, who better to risk his life
for me than my best friend, huh? Huh?

17:55.330 --> 17:56.920
Wait, Carlton.

17:57.600 --> 18:00.030
I think I see somebody down there.

18:00.540 --> 18:01.870
We're saved.

18:02.040 --> 18:04.010
[ECHOING]
Hello, up here!

18:06.240 --> 18:08.330
I think he sees us.

18:08.580 --> 18:11.270
[MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]

18:12.080 --> 18:13.640
What? What did he say?

18:14.180 --> 18:16.340
I think he said, "Don't yell. "

18:17.590 --> 18:19.380
Don't yell?

18:19.720 --> 18:21.160
[YELLING THEN ECHOING]
Why not?

18:22.860 --> 18:25.350
[RUMBLING]

18:27.430 --> 18:30.130
BOTH:
Avalanche!

18:35.540 --> 18:37.530
[GRUNTS]

18:57.960 --> 19:01.590
- You don't think anything bad happened?
- I'm sure they'll be back any second.

19:01.760 --> 19:03.600
[WILL SCREAMING THEN THUDS]

19:05.700 --> 19:06.730
[CARLTON SCREAMING]

19:06.900 --> 19:08.100
What was that?

19:08.270 --> 19:09.860
[THUDS]

19:12.510 --> 19:15.570
Hey, you know,
you never know how brave you can be...

19:15.740 --> 19:18.040
...until you don't have no choice.

19:19.180 --> 19:22.080
Now I see how people
could jump out of burning buildings.

19:22.550 --> 19:24.950
You couldn't figure it out before?

19:28.590 --> 19:31.350
Look, Lisa, we still have a full day left.

19:31.530 --> 19:35.690
- Why don't we make the most of it?
- I would like that, Carlton.

19:36.670 --> 19:39.190
There's three of us now,
we need to get another room.

19:39.770 --> 19:41.530
I have a room.

19:45.570 --> 19:46.630
Hey, isn't that great?

19:46.810 --> 19:50.210
Now you and I can stay together
and Lisa can stay with her.

19:54.320 --> 19:55.840
I can't believe it.

19:56.450 --> 20:00.410
<i>How could you not take the insurance?
It only costs an extra $6.</i>

20:01.560 --> 20:04.320
Sweetheart,
in honor of your new house...

20:04.490 --> 20:06.480
...we've put together
a little photo album for you.

20:06.660 --> 20:08.220
HILARY:
Oh.

20:08.430 --> 20:11.420
Naugahyde. Wow.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.930
- You really went all out.
- Ha-ha-ha.

20:14.100 --> 20:15.800
Just look at the pictures.

20:15.970 --> 20:19.270
Oh, look, here I am at Camp Gucciwanka.
Ha.

20:20.180 --> 20:22.010
Camp Gucciwanka?

20:22.180 --> 20:25.240
Oh, yeah,
that's Apache for "over-privileged. "

20:27.280 --> 20:31.410
I drew a picture of the family,
and that's you with the diamond.

20:34.060 --> 20:38.390
Oh. I'm gonna miss you all so much.

20:41.230 --> 20:44.170
Will, you take good care
of that little lady.

20:44.770 --> 20:49.470
And, Carlton, you stay just who you are,
I mean that.

20:50.710 --> 20:54.270
And, Daddy, don't worry, I still have
duplicates of all your credit cards.

20:54.740 --> 20:56.400
[PHIL LAUGHS]

20:57.680 --> 21:00.310
Goodbye, little house.

21:01.050 --> 21:03.710
Goodbye, little yard.

21:05.350 --> 21:08.620
Oh, goodbye, little lamp.

21:08.820 --> 21:11.160
No, I could use this.

21:13.800 --> 21:15.320
[CRIES]

21:18.070 --> 21:21.830
- One down, four to go.
- Take it easy, Philip.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.200
It's still about 13 years
before our nest is empty.

21:26.880 --> 21:30.330
Oh. Hey, guys, listen, me and Lisa
about to run to Roscoe, get a little grub.

21:30.510 --> 21:31.710
Uh, Carlton, you wanna go?

21:32.480 --> 21:34.040
No, three is a crowd.

21:34.880 --> 21:36.580
- Come on.
- Okay.

21:36.750 --> 21:39.240
- See you later.
PHIL, VIVIAN & ASHLEY: Bye.

21:41.990 --> 21:45.720
- Did you forget something, sweetheart?
- Um, not something, someone.
