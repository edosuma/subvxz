00:45.535 --> 00:47.240
Ricky's still sleeping with Adrian.

00:47.270 --> 00:48.380
???Ricky?

00:48.420 --> 00:49.760
I know he's there,Adrian.

00:49.790 --> 00:51.160
I don't know. ????

00:51.180 --> 00:53.080
You're a really bad friend.

00:53.140 --> 00:54.660
If I decide to have the baby adopted,

00:54.700 --> 00:56.610
then I will decide
who the parents should be.

00:56.640 --> 00:59.240
Okay. Whatever you want.

01:04.840 --> 01:06.880
Come on. Mom is waiting
to take us to school.

01:06.910 --> 01:08.580
I'm not going to school.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.340
I'm don't feel well. I'm pregnant.

01:12.370 --> 01:13.870
No,really?

01:14.420 --> 01:16.580
You know,that's not gonna
get you out of school,Amy.

01:17.820 --> 01:19.870
So did Ben ever call?

01:19.900 --> 01:21.050
Nope.

01:21.100 --> 01:24.290
You know,I could pawn this,
if you don't want it.

01:25.070 --> 01:26.400
What is it?

01:26.430 --> 01:27.690
A man's wedding ring.

01:27.720 --> 01:28.900
Where'd you get that?

01:28.940 --> 01:31.340
Veronica gave it to me.
It's her ex's.

01:31.370 --> 01:34.940
Who's Veronica? And why did
she give that ring to you?

01:34.980 --> 01:36.330
She's that waitress.

01:36.360 --> 01:37.910
She felt bad about taking my tips,

01:37.960 --> 01:40.540
so she gave me her
ex-husband's wedding ring.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.850
What am I supposed to do with it?

01:45.890 --> 01:48.110
Ben would never accept this ring now.

01:50.260 --> 01:52.550
I should have never invited Ricky over.

01:52.600 --> 01:55.710
Oh,come on,'s not that bibig a deal.

01:56.780 --> 01:58.950
You were just trying
to do the right thing.

01:59.010 --> 02:01.530
The wrong way,but the right thing.

02:01.570 --> 02:02.940
I should have just waited...

02:02.980 --> 02:04.290
Waited for what,Amy?

02:04.320 --> 02:06.170
Dad told me not to tell Mom,but--

02:06.210 --> 02:09.030
But I'm not gonna tell her,
so you can tell me.

02:09.060 --> 02:12.000
And then when Mom does find out,
like she always does,

02:12.050 --> 02:13.840
you and I can both get
into trouble together.

02:13.860 --> 02:15.370
So go ahead.

02:15.410 --> 02:17.120
Dad found a couple.

02:17.150 --> 02:18.330
A couple of what?

02:18.380 --> 02:19.930
A couple to adopt the baby.

02:19.970 --> 02:22.910
A couple who is willing to go
along with an open adoption.

02:22.950 --> 02:24.930
I can still see my son.

02:24.960 --> 02:27.270
You can still see him.
We can all still see him.

02:28.010 --> 02:29.990
We can all still be involved in his life,

02:30.010 --> 02:33.600
and yet,he'll have two responsible
adult parents who can take care of him.

02:33.640 --> 02:35.560
This is kind of
a theme with you,isn't it?

02:35.600 --> 02:37.780
Trying to get someone else
to do what you should do.

02:37.820 --> 02:40.320
I'm getting someone else
to do what I can't do.

02:40.350 --> 02:41.490
Who,Amy?

02:41.530 --> 02:45.010
I'd love to know what couple Dad knows
that would make good parents.???

02:45.040 --> 02:46.800
Donovan and Leon.

02:47.170 --> 02:48.930
Donovan and Leon?

02:49.640 --> 02:50.970
Donovan and Leon.

02:51.010 --> 02:53.490
Yeah. They've been wanting
to adopt for a while now.

02:53.520 --> 02:55.520
Ah,I see.

02:55.570 --> 02:57.950
And there are no needy children
anywhere in the country,

02:57.980 --> 02:59.800
nay the entire world,who need a home?

02:59.860 --> 03:02.220
It really isn't easy
for gay couples to adopt.

03:02.260 --> 03:03.770
So you're what,doing them a favor?

03:03.820 --> 03:04.790
The way I see it,

03:04.820 --> 03:08.230
it's benefiting me,the baby,and them.

03:08.260 --> 03:10.070
You know what? Give me that ring back.

03:10.480 --> 03:11.960
You've lost your mind.

03:12.590 --> 03:14.740
You can take care of this baby,Amy.

03:15.230 --> 03:16.740
You're not giving away my nephew.

03:16.770 --> 03:18.400
Ashley,you can still see him.

03:18.440 --> 03:19.760
Don't get me wrong,

03:19.800 --> 03:20.550
there are a lot of nights

03:20.580 --> 03:23.340
when I wish I was being
raised by Donovan and Leon,

03:23.730 --> 03:27.740
but you can't just give
the baby away to anyone.

03:27.760 --> 03:30.150
You can't. I know you.

03:32.360 --> 03:33.750
You're giving the baby up for adoption

03:33.780 --> 03:35.780
so you can keep Ben,aren't you?

Hey,this is why 15-year-olds
should not get married.

03:51.990 --> 03:53.780
I mean,you did everything you could.

03:53.820 --> 03:55.500
I mean,we did everything we could.

03:55.540 --> 03:57.240
It didn't work out,Benjamin.

03:57.280 --> 03:59.160
She's a nice girl. I love Amy.

03:59.230 --> 04:01.210
And I know that you love Amy,
but that doesn't mean

04:01.250 --> 04:03.650
you should spend the rest
of your lives together.

04:03.690 --> 04:05.970
Now,let me tell you something,
I'm really proud of you

04:06.010 --> 04:08.460
for standing up and
saying that's enough.

04:09.040 --> 04:12.420
A man has to do that sometimes,
even if it's tough.

04:12.460 --> 04:14.820
I don't feel like going to school today.

04:14.890 --> 04:16.640
Well,you're going.

04:16.700 --> 04:19.170
Look,this is a very complicated situation,

04:19.200 --> 04:20.850
and there's no un-complicating it.

04:20.890 --> 04:22.220
You did the right thing.

04:22.250 --> 04:23.830
And if you have any doubts about Amy,

04:23.870 --> 04:26.520
and I think you do,
you did the right thing.

04:26.550 --> 04:27.540
I don't know,Dad.

04:27.580 --> 04:30.110
I don't know if not seeing
Amy is the right thing,but...

04:31.010 --> 04:34.380
She's having Ricky's baby,
it's not mine,

04:35.090 --> 04:38.120
and there's nothing I can do about
it if she wants to be with him.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.890
It-- It might even be better for the
baby if she's with him,you know?

04:42.930 --> 04:44.510
Now you're talking.

04:44.570 --> 04:47.860
Come on. It'll be all right.

05:14.470 --> 05:15.990
Hello.

05:16.020 --> 05:17.570
Hi,Jack?

05:17.610 --> 05:18.840
Shawna?

05:18.880 --> 05:19.550
How are you?

05:19.580 --> 05:21.250
Uh,how are you?

05:21.300 --> 05:22.920
You okay?

05:22.960 --> 05:25.080
Yeah,I'm okay. Why?

05:26.030 --> 05:27.470
I don't know.

05:29.470 --> 05:32.690
I've been thinking
about you all weekend.

05:32.730 --> 05:34.360
While you were with your boyfriend?

05:34.410 --> 05:36.030
I have a confession.

05:36.070 --> 05:37.850
I don't have a boyfriend.

05:37.880 --> 05:38.880
You don't have a boyfriend?

05:38.940 --> 05:43.060
No. It's just you're too young for me.

05:43.090 --> 05:44.500
But you don't have a boyfriend.

05:44.540 --> 05:47.370
Which doesn't change the fact
that you're in high school.

05:47.400 --> 05:49.670
Just pretend I was held
back like three grades.

05:49.710 --> 05:50.820
How about four?

05:50.850 --> 05:52.660
What are you,20? That's not that old.

05:52.700 --> 05:53.540
Thanks.

05:53.580 --> 05:55.340
No,seriously. You're not
that much older than me.

05:55.390 --> 05:59.880
Okay,look,I am older
than you,and I like you,

05:59.920 --> 06:02.740
but I'm warning you,I don't like clingy,

06:02.780 --> 06:05.260
and I don't want our relationship

06:05.310 --> 06:07.470
to affect your relationship with Duncan.

06:07.510 --> 06:09.810
So...we're in a relationship.

06:09.850 --> 06:10.670
Clingy.

06:10.710 --> 06:12.570
I got it. I got it.

06:12.600 --> 06:13.860
You know,I knew you liked me.

06:13.900 --> 06:15.860
You totally freaked
me out when you did that.

06:15.890 --> 06:17.010
Sorry.

06:19.040 --> 06:19.820
What?

06:19.870 --> 06:21.400
I gotta go find somebody.

06:21.440 --> 06:23.230
Somebody other than me?

06:23.270 --> 06:24.680
Now who's clingy?

06:25.470 --> 06:26.900
No,you got me so upset
that I went out

06:26.930 --> 06:29.520
and did something stupid,
and now I gotta fix it.

06:29.560 --> 06:31.530
- Can I call you later?
- You don't have to.

06:31.560 --> 06:32.640
But can I?

06:33.160 --> 06:35.200
Yes. Bye.

06:35.240 --> 06:36.770
I love you.

06:36.800 --> 06:37.580
What?

06:37.610 --> 06:39.500
I'm joking. Relax. Bye.

06:42.180 --> 06:43.380
I knew this would happen.

06:43.410 --> 06:45.010
It was just too good to be true.

06:45.050 --> 06:46.850
He was just too clingy.

06:46.890 --> 06:47.420
Yeah.

06:47.450 --> 06:48.640
Who,me?

06:49.070 --> 06:50.010
Ben.

06:50.050 --> 06:52.160
Oh. Yeah,I can see that.

06:52.200 --> 06:54.070
See? Everyone knows it.

06:54.100 --> 06:56.280
Yeah,and when he got together with Amy,

06:56.320 --> 06:57.640
we never saw her again.

06:57.690 --> 06:59.340
He just hogged all her time.

06:59.390 --> 07:01.580
Just because I wasn't
allowed to go over there

07:01.620 --> 07:03.620
after my parents found out
she was pregnant

07:03.650 --> 07:06.740
doesn't mean she couldn't
spend more time with us after school.

07:07.530 --> 07:09.510
And how pretentious is
it that he had a driver?

07:09.540 --> 07:10.900
I mean,who has a driver?

07:11.860 --> 07:14.550
So which one of you two
is gonna try to date Ben next?

07:14.580 --> 07:15.910
I have a boyfriend.

07:15.960 --> 07:18.100
Oh,I forgot.

07:18.740 --> 07:21.660
I don't know,Madison,it just
Ls like d I are friends.

07:21.710 --> 07:23.500
Not like boyfriend and gi Tiend.

07:23.540 --> 07:25.560
So is it true that you told
Henry that the only reason

07:25.600 --> 07:28.250
we hooked up is because
you're a lazy dater?

07:28.300 --> 07:30.280
Are you calling me lazy?
Because I resent that.

07:35.120 --> 07:37.500
Yeah,that's what he tells people:

07:37.520 --> 07:39.920
that we're together
because he's a lazy dater.

07:39.970 --> 07:41.090
It's true.

07:41.130 --> 07:41.560
What?

07:41.610 --> 07:43.920
Come on,you're like
the only girl he knows

07:43.960 --> 07:46.310
other than me,and he can't date me.

07:46.350 --> 07:47.540
So he doesn't even like me?

07:47.570 --> 07:50.360
No,he does,but he might liirls too

07:50.400 --> 07:52.590
if he went out with them
like my parents-- Ooh.

07:54.230 --> 07:55.750
Like your parents what?

07:56.090 --> 07:57.520
I thought your parents loved me.

07:57.550 --> 08:00.780
They do. But you're the first
girl he's ever dated and...

08:00.820 --> 08:02.230
And?

08:02.260 --> 08:06.890
They doubt that you'll be the last
girl he ever goes out with,no offense.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.180
Great. So why don't you
just get a bunch more friends

08:09.210 --> 08:10.290
and he can date all them too.

08:10.320 --> 08:14.530
Hold it.We can't fight each other
when fighting with Amy against Ben.

08:14.560 --> 08:16.070
We have to be a team.

08:16.100 --> 08:17.180
Yeah. You're right.

08:17.220 --> 08:21.260
So go find Jason and make up.
We've got work to do.

08:26.780 --> 08:28.580
Hey,just forget about what
I said the other night. Okay?

08:28.610 --> 08:31.800
It's none of my business whether
Ricky's still sleeping with Adrian.

08:31.830 --> 08:32.950
And I'm probably wrong.

08:33.010 --> 08:33.850
What?

08:33.880 --> 08:34.900
I shouldn't have done that.

08:34.929 --> 08:36.460
It's just that Shawna had dumped me--

08:36.500 --> 08:38.490
- Wait. Who's Shawna?
- Duncan's sister.

08:38.520 --> 08:40.640
- Who's Duncan?
- The kid I'm mentoring.

08:40.669 --> 08:44.910
And his sister,well,she's the first girl
I've had any feelings for since you.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.220
Excuse me?

08:48.260 --> 08:50.160
I like you. As a friend.

08:50.190 --> 08:52.080
And I'm having a conversation with Grace.

08:55.220 --> 08:56.690
-Oh! 
-Okay.

08:57.380 --> 08:58.960
Anyway,where was I?

08:59.000 --> 09:00.400
I think you were about
to get dumped,

09:00.440 --> 09:02.300
which led me to making
a certain phone call.

09:02.320 --> 09:04.960
All right. Shawna broke up with
me because she had a boyfriend,

09:04.990 --> 09:06.810
which she didn't tell me before,

09:06.840 --> 09:08.700
so I came to your house all upset,

09:08.740 --> 09:10.100
then I get a phone call
from her telling me

09:10.140 --> 09:12.790
she didn't have
a boyfriend after all. So.

09:12.820 --> 09:15.490
Well,I called right
after you left my house.

09:16.020 --> 09:17.790
Adrian was with Ricky.

09:19.610 --> 09:22.120
Well,you're not mad at me
for telling you,are you?

09:22.160 --> 09:24.980
I mean,I'd want someone to tell
me if Shawna was cheating on me.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.820
Shut up,Jack. I don't even know Shawna.

09:26.860 --> 09:28.600
Oh,you gotta meet her. She's great.

09:28.630 --> 09:30.060
Oh,yeah,I'm sure she is.

09:30.100 --> 09:32.380
Especially lying about having
a boyfriend and everything.

09:32.420 --> 09:33.680
Yeah.

09:46.290 --> 09:49.380
Do you know how many teen relationships
last for more than six months?

09:49.400 --> 09:52.840
No,but I really thought Ben
and Amy would last a lifetime.

09:53.230 --> 09:54.290
Ben and Amy?

09:54.320 --> 09:55.420
They broke up.

09:55.460 --> 09:56.890
And he didn't even call me?

09:56.920 --> 09:58.730
Why would he call you?
He's my best friend.

09:59.360 --> 10:00.700
He's my best friend too.

10:00.730 --> 10:03.310
No,you were his best friend
because you were with me.

10:03.350 --> 10:04.660
That is so sexist.

10:04.700 --> 10:06.910
My friendship with Ben
has nothing to do with you.

10:06.950 --> 10:08.740
Ask him. I'm his best friend too.

10:08.780 --> 10:10.210
Did he tell you he broke up with Amy?

10:10.250 --> 10:12.280
That's not the test
of friendship,knowing things.

10:12.310 --> 10:15.390
The test of friendship is whether
or not you hate the same people.

10:15.410 --> 10:17.720
The common denominator
between all people.

10:17.760 --> 10:19.190
Hatred for the enemy.

10:19.230 --> 10:21.030
And who would the enemy be?

10:21.060 --> 10:22.430
In this case,Amy.

10:22.470 --> 10:24.190
Hi. What about Amy?

10:24.220 --> 10:25.570
I hate her after what she did to you.

10:25.610 --> 10:27.120
Going after Ricky like that.

10:27.150 --> 10:28.570
That-- That harlot.

10:28.620 --> 10:30.200
Don't talk about Amy like that.

10:30.230 --> 10:32.040
What do you call a girl
who's married to one guy

10:32.070 --> 10:33.420
and tries to date
the father of her baby?

10:33.450 --> 10:35.630
They probably don't
even have a name for that.

10:35.660 --> 10:37.030
I stand by harlot.

10:41.670 --> 10:43.300
You know,this is all your fault.

10:43.330 --> 10:45.900
He was going after Grace
when you pointed out Amy

10:45.930 --> 10:47.660
and ruined his life.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.450
So I have a problem.

10:54.470 --> 10:55.760
Why am I not surprised?

10:55.800 --> 10:57.870
Okay,let me tell you
what happened. Ricky and Amy--

10:57.900 --> 10:58.910
- Hup,hup,hup.- But--

10:58.950 --> 11:02.460
No. Look,you brought your personal
problems into the office,

11:02.480 --> 11:05.150
now I'm taking your personal
problems outta the office.

11:05.190 --> 11:06.050
If you wanna talk--

11:06.070 --> 11:07.550
I do wanna talk.
I wanna talk about this.

11:07.600 --> 11:10.310
Up-bup. If you wanna
talk about school,

11:10.350 --> 11:11.630
the door is always open.

11:11.670 --> 11:14.230
School? Why would I wanna
talk about school?

11:14.270 --> 11:16.650
Because that's what
I'm here for,to talk about school.

11:16.680 --> 11:18.380
And I happen to very good at that.

11:18.410 --> 11:20.010
So I'm gonna stick to what I'm good at.

11:20.050 --> 11:21.230
I need to talk to you.

11:21.260 --> 11:22.830
About? The mentoring program.

11:22.870 --> 11:24.780
Enter. Exit.

11:29.350 --> 11:32.380
So how's it going?
Any problem with the kid?

11:32.720 --> 11:33.570
The kid?

11:33.600 --> 11:34.670
That you're mentoring?

11:34.710 --> 11:37.130
Oh. Yeah. Duncan. Ah,he's great.

11:37.160 --> 11:38.320
So,what'd you want to talk about?

11:38.370 --> 11:39.290
Duncan's sister.

11:39.330 --> 11:41.200
Oh,no,no,no. No sister.

11:41.230 --> 11:43.910
We aren't talking about
anything other than mentoring.

11:43.940 --> 11:45.180
My mentoree has a sister--

11:45.230 --> 11:47.090
Hup,hup,hup. Out,out,out.

11:47.120 --> 11:48.740
But-- Nope. Can't do it.

11:48.780 --> 11:51.270
This office is for
academic consultation only.

11:51.310 --> 11:53.770
All right. No one told me.
I thought you did it all.

11:53.810 --> 11:55.090
Not anymore.

11:55.110 --> 11:56.960
- You see,it's just that she--
- Stop.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.840
Unless she suggested a
college you wanna check out.

11:59.880 --> 12:00.580
No.

12:00.600 --> 12:02.110
Then I can't help you.

12:09.700 --> 12:11.430
I'm thinking about having
sex with my brother.

12:18.150 --> 12:19.670
What'd I say?

13:05.600 --> 13:06.150
What's going on?

13:06.190 --> 13:08.080
What are you doing here
in the middle of the day?

13:08.110 --> 13:09.180
Why aren't you at the store?

13:09.220 --> 13:11.260
I'm not feeling well.
Thanks for your concern.

13:12.380 --> 13:13.940
What's with the flowers?
Someone die?

13:13.970 --> 13:16.070
I'm just trying to make
the house look presentable.

13:16.550 --> 13:18.110
Who do you have to present the house to?

13:18.140 --> 13:19.860
Reverend Stone is
introducing me to a nice couple

13:19.920 --> 13:22.230
who might be interested in adopting.

13:22.260 --> 13:24.120
Well,that's just like you
to try and go behind my back

13:24.150 --> 13:25.840
to try to find adoptive
parents that you like,

13:25.870 --> 13:26.980
and then force them on me.

13:27.030 --> 13:29.170
I'm not forcing anyone on you.

13:29.200 --> 13:31.820
Jim and Linda just want
to have a casual meeting.

13:31.840 --> 13:33.470
If everything goes well,
if I like them,

13:33.510 --> 13:36.170
and if it seems like they'll be
nice parents,I'll introduce them to Amy.

13:36.210 --> 13:36.880
And me?

13:36.910 --> 13:38.290
Yes,and you,George.

13:38.330 --> 13:39.640
Well,I can't today.

13:39.690 --> 13:41.240
Like I told you,I'm not feeling well.

13:41.280 --> 13:43.190
That's why I came home and
left the store to Donovan.

13:43.970 --> 13:45.360
Donovan can handle anything.

13:45.390 --> 13:47.240
He's a good businessman
and a nice person.

13:47.280 --> 13:50.100
And so is...his friend.

13:50.130 --> 13:53.990
Yeah,I love Donovan.
And Leon. What's your point?

13:54.060 --> 13:55.380
I don't have a point.

13:55.420 --> 13:57.020
Yeah,big surprise.

14:12.650 --> 14:14.100
What are you doing?

14:14.140 --> 14:15.470
I miss the party?

14:16.530 --> 14:18.450
Just cleaning out the fridge.

14:18.480 --> 14:21.870
Really,the whole fridge,
or just the wine bottle part?

14:22.160 --> 14:23.330
Uh,cooking wine.

14:23.380 --> 14:25.580
It's turned sour,
kinda like someone else I know.

14:25.640 --> 14:26.600
What are you doing home?

14:26.630 --> 14:28.230
I thought I'd stop by,
have a little lunch.

14:28.260 --> 14:31.140
Oh,really? Lunch or
a lecture perhaps?

14:31.560 --> 14:32.330
Lecture?

14:32.360 --> 14:35.200
Yeah,it seems like you've been
working on it for a couple weeks now,

14:35.230 --> 14:36.740
Should be a pretty good one,I bet.

14:36.780 --> 14:40.270
You know,we haven't
been having much sex lately.

14:40.310 --> 14:42.530
Yeah,that's because I've been
getting drunk in the afternoon

14:42.580 --> 14:43.900
and taking care of myself.

14:45.780 --> 14:48.290
I'm joking. About the drinking.

14:48.960 --> 14:51.200
Come on. You don't think
I'm cheating on you,do you?

14:51.230 --> 14:53.040
You kinda just admitted
to that,didn't you?

14:53.080 --> 14:55.410
Although that kinda cheating
really,uh,turns me on.

14:55.460 --> 14:58.380
Uh,uh,no. Focus. Focus.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.020
Listen.

15:02.980 --> 15:04.370
Here's the thing.

15:04.910 --> 15:07.690
If you had just told me about
your cheating on George

15:07.720 --> 15:09.110
when we first met,it wouldn't
have made any difference.

15:09.170 --> 15:10.620
But you didn't. You lied to me.

15:10.650 --> 15:11.670
You told me that he cheated on you,

15:11.710 --> 15:14.850
so that means we've been
living in this lie for 17 years.

15:14.880 --> 15:16.740
You have been lying
to me for 17 years.

15:16.780 --> 15:19.210
Marshall,we talked about
it only one time.

15:19.250 --> 15:20.490
And that was 17 years ago.

15:20.540 --> 15:21.460
I think we should talk again.

15:21.500 --> 15:22.430
Then let's talk about it.

15:22.480 --> 15:23.190
Fine. Lets.

15:23.230 --> 15:24.600
You know,I don't think you get it.

15:24.660 --> 15:26.990
I just didn't want you to know
that I cheated on my husband.

15:27.030 --> 15:29.350
But you did. But that's
between you and him.

15:29.390 --> 15:30.200
It's got nothing to do with us.

15:30.240 --> 15:31.920
The lie,that's between you and me.

15:31.960 --> 15:34.260
You know,I wish you would
lie about something.

15:34.290 --> 15:36.500
I wish you weren't so perfect.

15:36.550 --> 15:38.790
Your perfect hair.
Your perfect teeth.

15:38.830 --> 15:41.560
Your perfect...butt.

15:42.340 --> 15:43.500
Thank you.

15:44.260 --> 15:47.730
Marshall,I'm not the same person
I was when I lied to you.

15:47.770 --> 15:49.920
Okay,so just forgive me. Please?

15:49.960 --> 15:52.570
Oh,it's about damn time!
What took you so long?

15:52.650 --> 15:55.050
Of cours Of hat's all
I ever wanted to hear.

15:55.080 --> 15:56.380
- Thank you!
- I forgive you.

15:56.440 --> 15:58.000
Ah! What are you doing?

15:58.030 --> 15:59.190
Where's Tom?

15:59.230 --> 16:02.490
He's upstairs. He's mad at Tammy
'cause she's not talking to him.

16:04.760 --> 16:06.320
Looks like I'll be going
right back to work now.

16:10.640 --> 16:12.470
Hey. I'll see you tonight.

16:12.500 --> 16:15.240
Yes,you will.

16:27.250 --> 16:28.230
You're an idiot.

16:28.260 --> 16:29.500
No wonder we can't get a baby.

16:29.540 --> 16:31.320
You can't drink a beer at an interview.

16:31.350 --> 16:32.470
He offered.

16:32.510 --> 16:34.120
Infertility can be really stressful.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.070
I'll say.

16:35.100 --> 16:36.720
Then again,so can fertility.

16:37.290 --> 16:38.860
Oh,you talking about Amy's situation?

16:38.890 --> 16:39.910
I-I just can't help it.

16:39.940 --> 16:42.100
It just makes me so angry
that a 15-year-old girl

16:42.160 --> 16:43.700
can get pregnant and I can't.

16:43.730 --> 16:45.170
Yeah. First time too.

16:45.570 --> 16:46.550
Thanks.

16:46.570 --> 16:49.540
You know,I gotta tell you that
you people get an A+ for honesty.

16:49.560 --> 16:51.540
Well,you're a breath
of fresh air yourself.

16:53.050 --> 16:54.640
So can we talk about the baby?

16:54.670 --> 16:56.050
We could,but I gotta tell you,

16:56.090 --> 16:58.480
I'm not quite sure
I want the baby adopted.

16:58.690 --> 16:59.740
I mean,it's my grandson.

16:59.770 --> 17:01.510
I'm gonna wanna see him once in a while.

17:01.550 --> 17:03.480
Would there be a problem with that?

17:03.930 --> 17:07.780
Well,George,I think our parents
would see the baby as their grandson.

17:07.839 --> 17:10.730
I-I'm not open to an open adoption.

17:10.760 --> 17:13.240
And no offense,
but I don't want to share the baby

17:13.280 --> 17:15.130
with Amy and your family,no.

17:15.160 --> 17:16.640
If we were to take the baby,

17:16.670 --> 17:19.060
we would want you
to stay out of his life.

17:19.099 --> 17:21.770
I don't want him to have
two mommies and two daddies

17:21.839 --> 17:24.890
and three grandmothers and
three grandfathers and whatever.

17:24.930 --> 17:26.650
You know,I just don't
think I can do that.

17:26.680 --> 17:29.890
Well,we could think about
whether we could do that.

17:30.620 --> 17:31.860
Honey?

17:31.930 --> 17:33.210
No,we couldn't,honey.

17:33.240 --> 17:34.990
Look,you seem like
a really nice couple,

17:35.010 --> 17:37.200
but I'm looking for an open adoption.

17:37.240 --> 17:39.950
That is,if there is an adoption.

17:39.990 --> 17:42.250
But,you know,your wife
didn't say anything about that.

17:43.170 --> 17:46.910
Oh,I forgot,yes. Mental problems.

17:46.960 --> 17:48.620
All right,well,Jim,we should go.

17:48.660 --> 17:49.950
Hey,thanks for dropping by.

18:00.810 --> 18:02.610
Run for it! Run!

18:08.720 --> 18:09.810
They weren't qualified.

18:09.860 --> 18:11.630
You're not qualified to determine that.

18:11.660 --> 18:13.440
And you  waitg in there.

18:13.470 --> 18:14.530
???

18:14.560 --> 18:16.640
Well,obviously not. I married you.

18:19.370 --> 18:20.240
Hello?

18:20.260 --> 18:21.630
Hey,Anne,it's Donovan.

18:21.690 --> 18:23.810
Hi. Is everything okay at the store?

18:23.840 --> 18:25.160
Oh,everything's fine.

18:25.230 --> 18:28.050
I was gonna drop off
something for George at closing,

18:28.080 --> 18:29.160
and I was just wondering

18:29.200 --> 18:32.470
if you and I could get together
for a few minutes and talk

18:32.510 --> 18:35.330
since we've already
talked to George,Leon and I.

18:35.370 --> 18:39.360
Sure. Oh,you're not quitting,
are you,Donovan,please?

18:39.390 --> 18:42.340
So George talked to you?

18:42.400 --> 18:44.040
About...?

18:58.870 --> 19:02.430
Don't feel bad,Amy.
You did nothing wrong.

19:02.470 --> 19:05.500
You have the right to talk
to whomever you want to,

19:05.530 --> 19:06.950
whenever you want to.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.550
- Ben is weak. - Yeah.

19:08.570 --> 19:10.020
I'm the weak one.

19:10.050 --> 19:12.500
I should have told Ben
that Ricky was coming over.

19:12.530 --> 19:14.520
I'm gonna go find him
and apologize.

19:14.550 --> 19:16.330
I had my chance
this morning,and I blew it.

19:16.370 --> 19:18.170
Wait. Apologize for what?

19:18.210 --> 19:20.870
It's none of his beeswax
if Ricky comes over.

19:20.900 --> 19:24.430
And once the baby's born,
he's probably gonna be

19:24.480 --> 19:25.390
That's just the thing,

19:25.440 --> 19:27.800
I think I found
a couple to adopt the baby.

19:27.830 --> 19:30.040
Maybe. If it all works out.

19:30.070 --> 19:31.660
So if the baby is adopted,

19:31.710 --> 19:33.890
then I'm not exactly
still tied to Ricky.

19:33.930 --> 19:36.460
Which is great,because I don't
wanna be tied to Ricky.

19:36.990 --> 19:38.370
I wanna be tied to Ben.

19:40.060 --> 19:41.360
I'm gonna give this to him.

19:41.390 --> 19:44.380
Oh,no,don't do that.
Don't give that to him.

19:44.410 --> 19:47.000
Wait for him to come
and apologize to you.

19:47.070 --> 19:48.970
Yeah,even if it were your fault--

19:49.020 --> 19:50.310
Which it wasn't.

19:50.350 --> 19:52.730
You just don't wanna make it seem
like you're dangling a ring

19:52.760 --> 19:54.360
in front of him just to get him back.

19:54.630 --> 19:55.750
But I want him back.

19:55.780 --> 19:57.910
Well,then,let him come to you.

19:57.960 --> 19:59.560
Let him buy you jewelry.

19:59.600 --> 20:00.470
That's better.

20:00.490 --> 20:02.740
And if he doesn't come and apologize to me,

20:02.780 --> 20:04.060
and he doesn't buy me jewelry?

20:04.100 --> 20:05.520
Well,then,he doesn't deserve you.

20:05.550 --> 20:09.140
You have your whole
lifeahead of yo ???n do anything.

20:09.175 --> 20:12.050
And like you said,once
the baby's born,he won't be around.

20:12.100 --> 20:14.320
So you won't be tied to the baby,

20:14.360 --> 20:16.900
or Ben,or Ricky or anyone.

20:16.930 --> 20:18.760
You can start your life over.

20:18.800 --> 20:21.490
Wouldn't it be great if I could
also start it over with Ben?

20:21.530 --> 20:24.960
Think about it. This whole
year has been a nightmare.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.400
Start over. Live your dreams.

20:29.200 --> 20:30.390
Speaking of dreams.

20:30.420 --> 20:32.140
I'm gonna catch up with you guys later.

20:33.980 --> 20:36.610
Ben's the only good thing
that has happened to me this year.

20:37.410 --> 20:38.750
I'm gonna hang onto him.

20:38.780 --> 20:40.270
I hate to say this to you,Amy,

20:40.330 --> 20:43.570
but maybe Ben doesn't want
you to hang onto him.

20:47.920 --> 20:50.420
They're conspiring
to get Ben back,I know it.

20:51.060 --> 20:52.470
Well,he does love her.

20:52.490 --> 20:54.840
No,he doesn't. He's just
a romantic idiot.

20:54.900 --> 20:56.900
He's in love with
the idea of being in love.

20:56.930 --> 20:58.500
He hasn't found his real love yet.

20:58.530 --> 21:01.350
He needs to get out there and
start looking for his real love.

21:01.740 --> 21:03.690
He needs to or you need to?

21:03.720 --> 21:05.860
He didn't even find Amy.
You found Amy for him.

21:05.890 --> 21:07.430
You can't leave that alone today?

21:07.460 --> 21:08.680
No,I can't.

21:08.710 --> 21:10.690
Look,none of this is my fault.
It's Amy's fault.

21:10.750 --> 21:13.980
She knew what condition she was in,
and she kept it all a secret.

21:14.020 --> 21:15.690
Pregnancy should be a deal breaker.

21:15.730 --> 21:17.090
He was bamboozled.

21:17.130 --> 21:20.280
I wasn't bamboozled.I just--
I don't know...

21:20.310 --> 21:21.790
I thought that I loved her.

21:21.830 --> 21:23.040
And what do you think now?

21:23.090 --> 21:26.070
I don't know,Alice.
I-I think she doesn't love me.

21:26.520 --> 21:28.630
I think that she wants
to love me,but--

21:28.690 --> 21:30.760
But she still might
have feelings for Ricky.

21:30.800 --> 21:33.420
I think that she's not
angry with him anymore,

21:34.130 --> 21:36.990
but I think that maybe...
Well,I don't know.

21:37.020 --> 21:38.770
The more I thought
about it this weekend,

21:38.810 --> 21:40.060
the more I think that
Amy's not the kind of girl

21:40.110 --> 21:42.600
who would even make out with a guy
unless she had feelings for him.

21:42.620 --> 21:43.620
Things might have gone too far,

21:43.660 --> 21:45.850
and I'm sure she didn't mean
to get pregnant,but...

21:46.440 --> 21:49.260
She had to have at least
been somewhat attracted to him.

21:49.300 --> 21:51.000
Oh,that's good.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.970
But,I mean,on the other hand,though,

21:56.000 --> 21:57.590
even if she was attracted to him,

21:57.650 --> 21:59.520
maybe she's not attracted
to him anymore.

21:59.560 --> 22:02.160
Maybe now that she knows him,
she's not attracted to him.

22:02.210 --> 22:04.280
Maybe she was trying to do
the right thing for the

22:04.330 --> 22:06.570
by talking to him and
trying to be friends.

22:06.600 --> 22:09.220
I'm not sure. I'm not sure
of anything anymore.

22:09.770 --> 22:11.000
I need a sign. You know.

22:11.060 --> 22:14.220
I need some sort of sign
that she really loves me.

22:23.550 --> 22:24.820
You are so naive.

22:24.870 --> 22:25.960
Am I?

22:26.000 --> 22:28.240
If you thought Ricky would never
sleep with me again,you are.

22:28.290 --> 22:30.400
Um,I asked you about seeing Ricky.

22:30.430 --> 22:33.870
And I told you that you could either
be friends with me or have sex with him.

22:33.920 --> 22:36.080
And I told you I wasn't
gonna have sex with him,

22:36.120 --> 22:38.530
so I thought that since
I'm not having sex with him,

22:38.580 --> 22:40.560
you still considered me
to be your friend,Adrian.

22:40.590 --> 22:43.050
I wanted to be friends,but no,
you had to sleep with Ricky,

22:43.100 --> 22:45.410
even though you don't love
him and you know that I do.

22:45.450 --> 22:47.850
Stop having sex with
every guy I go out with.

22:47.890 --> 22:50.750
Stop going out with guys
I'm having sex with.

22:50.790 --> 22:52.600
And you don't love him,
you don't even know him.

22:52.640 --> 22:54.840
I know him enough to
know he wants a nice girl,

22:54.880 --> 22:57.990
and I'm a nice girl,and you're not.

22:58.020 --> 22:59.460
What are you saying,Grace?

22:59.490 --> 23:01.090
You know what I'm saying.

23:01.130 --> 23:02.330
Say it.

23:02.370 --> 23:04.080
Say it to my face.

23:05.970 --> 23:07.460
You're the "B" word.

23:08.590 --> 23:10.440
The "B" word?

23:11.660 --> 23:13.140
What's the "B" word,Grace?

23:13.180 --> 23:14.770
You know what the "B" word is,Adrian,

23:14.810 --> 23:16.150
because that's what you are.

23:16.190 --> 23:17.050
Say it.

23:17.080 --> 23:19.420
No,I'm not gonna say it.
I'm gonna say something else.

23:19.450 --> 23:21.280
What? A prayer?

23:21.810 --> 23:24.740
Are you gonna say a prayer,
you Bible-thumping,two-faced virgin?

23:24.770 --> 23:25.930
Yeah. Maybe I will.

23:25.970 --> 23:28.550
God help Adrian
because she's a bitch!

23:29.750 --> 23:32.060
- Let go!
- You let go!

23:32.100 --> 23:32.970
No,you!

23:33.000 --> 23:35.320
-You,blondie! 
-You're hurting me!

23:35.350 --> 23:36.300
Good!

23:38.460 --> 23:39.660
Can somebody help me?

23:40.450 --> 23:41.990
You help her,I'll come after you!

23:44.860 --> 23:47.080
Are you laughing or crying?

23:47.120 --> 23:48.430
I'm laughing.

23:48.460 --> 23:50.040
What are you laughing at?

23:50.090 --> 23:52.810
Me. You.

23:52.850 --> 23:53.870
Look at us,

23:53.900 --> 23:56.980
this is completely
humiliating and funny.

23:57.010 --> 23:58.250
It's not funny!

23:58.880 --> 24:00.110
I'm sorry.

24:01.710 --> 24:03.080
Me too.

24:04.720 --> 24:05.970
I am a bitch.

24:06.010 --> 24:07.420
No,you're not.

24:07.460 --> 24:09.300
I shouldn't have said that.
I'm sorry.

24:09.340 --> 24:12.060
I like you. It's just,
Ricky's made me into an idiot.

24:12.110 --> 24:14.740
Oh,you're not an idiot.
You believe in the guy.

24:14.790 --> 24:16.320
Even though he did cheat on you.

24:16.360 --> 24:17.680
No,but don't you understand?

24:17.720 --> 24:20.400
That's just how guys like Ricky are
when they're raised that way.

24:20.440 --> 24:21.610
He doesn't have to be like that.

24:21.640 --> 24:23.320
He doesn't have to be a cheater.

24:23.360 --> 24:26.270
He could be a really good
and faithful husband one day.

24:26.300 --> 24:28.970
You're not naive,you're delusional,

24:29.020 --> 24:31.410
but go ahead,Grace. He's all yours.

24:31.450 --> 24:33.060
I'm not gonna sleep with him again.

24:33.100 --> 24:35.690
I have a new guy in my life.

24:35.730 --> 24:39.190
A guy that could maybe make a good
and faithful husband for me.

24:39.220 --> 24:40.470
Really? Who?

24:40.500 --> 24:41.750
My brother.

24:42.550 --> 24:44.000
It's a long story.

24:44.020 --> 24:46.330
Let's go get a cup
of coffee or something.

24:47.270 --> 24:49.550
Your hair looks good
messed up like that.

24:49.580 --> 24:51.320
Oh,thank you. So does yours.

24:55.190 --> 24:57.110
Look,I didn't mean to
break up the two of you.

24:57.140 --> 24:57.770
You didn't.

24:57.810 --> 24:59.260
Well,I heard you broke up.

24:59.290 --> 25:00.930
I don't think we actually broke up.

25:00.990 --> 25:03.420
I think he's just taking some
time to think about things.

25:03.450 --> 25:04.620
Translation. You broke up.

25:04.660 --> 25:06.770
Whether or not you were
officially told that.

25:06.810 --> 25:08.560
The guy's a wuss. Come on.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.200
No,he's not.

25:10.230 --> 25:12.840
He is. I said it to you the first
time I saw you out with him,

25:12.880 --> 25:14.290
and I'll say it again.

25:14.320 --> 25:16.000
He's not your type,Amy.

25:16.040 --> 25:17.770
I mean,it's admirable for him
to stick by you

25:17.810 --> 25:20.960
when you're having my baby,
but you are having my baby.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.220
And I know I agreed to give up
our baby,but Amy,it's killing me.

25:24.250 --> 25:27.050
Even if you find the perfect couple,
I don't know how you're gonna do it.

25:27.080 --> 25:28.660
I don't know how I'm gonna do it.

25:28.690 --> 25:31.530
Hold the baby,with his
tiny little hands and feet,

25:31.580 --> 25:32.890
completely helpless,

25:32.920 --> 25:34.960
and then just hand him over
to someone else.

25:36.660 --> 25:39.030
Hey,I didn't mean to upset you.
I'm sorry.

26:11.410 --> 26:13.820
Thank you for having me over for dinner.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.850
We'll order a pizza or something
if you're still hungry.

26:16.770 --> 26:17.870
Ugh. I can't believe that Amy.

26:17.900 --> 26:19.870
She has a boyfriend,a husband.

26:19.910 --> 26:21.500
Yeah. She and Ben are married.

26:21.530 --> 26:23.470
They got married in a church.

26:23.510 --> 26:25.030
I don't think it's a church.

26:25.100 --> 26:26.750
They just make it look like a chapel.

26:26.790 --> 26:28.700
Church,chapel. What's the difference?

26:28.730 --> 26:30.990
Those two promised to
stay together till death.

26:31.030 --> 26:32.500
Yeah,that's a pretty big promise,

26:32.540 --> 26:33.920
and they made that promise to God.

26:33.950 --> 26:36.590
Yeah,well,they made that
promise to Elbert anyway.

26:36.620 --> 26:37.790
Still. They're married.

26:37.820 --> 26:41.120
Yeah,well,Amy didn't look like
she was married to Ben today.

26:41.530 --> 26:43.470
She looked like she
was married to Ricky.

26:44.260 --> 26:45.630
I wanna be married to Ricky.

26:45.670 --> 26:47.890
Are you kidding me?
You caught us sleeping together.

26:49.060 --> 26:51.140
Oh,I thought you guys were having sex.

26:52.550 --> 26:53.890
I'm kidding.

26:53.930 --> 26:55.050
It's just that Ricky has
to have somebody

26:55.110 --> 26:57.890
to have sex with right now,
and that can't be me.

26:57.940 --> 27:00.710
Even if he's thinking about me
while he's having sex with you.

27:00.740 --> 27:03.170
He's not thinking about
you while having sex with me.

27:03.200 --> 27:06.410
Maybe not,but I bet I just ruined
sex with Ricky for you,didn't I?

27:06.450 --> 27:08.820
Nothing could ruin sex
with Ricky for me.

27:08.850 --> 27:10.320
Are you sure?

27:11.060 --> 27:12.460
He's not thinking about you.

27:12.480 --> 27:14.670
Yeah,well,obviously he's
thinking about Amy.

27:18.710 --> 27:21.990
Makeup sex,it's always good.

27:22.020 --> 27:23.720
Yeah.

27:23.760 --> 27:25.730
So have you lied to me
about anything else?

27:25.780 --> 27:27.200
Don't ruin this.

27:27.260 --> 27:28.740
All right.
Can I get you anything?

27:28.770 --> 27:31.250
Yeah,I'll have two
chocolate chip cookies

27:31.290 --> 27:32.760
and a glass of milk.

27:33.980 --> 27:35.380
Wait,honey. Make it three.

27:35.400 --> 27:36.320
They're kinda small.

27:36.370 --> 27:37.330
Got it.

27:39.140 --> 27:40.030
You know what I was thinking?

27:40.080 --> 27:42.610
I never know what you're thinking,

27:42.630 --> 27:44.260
but I know what I'm thinking.

27:44.680 --> 27:46.720
Maybe it would be nice to,um,

27:47.140 --> 27:49.050
expand our family just a little bit.

27:49.090 --> 27:50.570
No,no,no,no,no.

27:50.610 --> 27:52.810
You sure you mean no?
You only said no five times.

27:52.860 --> 27:54.970
Yeah. I'm very sure.

27:55.040 --> 27:56.490
I'm not having another baby.

27:56.520 --> 27:57.640
But you could.

27:57.690 --> 27:58.630
I'm not.

27:58.680 --> 28:01.080
But you could...

28:01.130 --> 28:04.420
Oh,no,you are not thinking
of adopting Amy's baby.

28:04.450 --> 28:07.400
No. Whatever gave you that idea?

28:07.450 --> 28:09.010
Grace suggested it.

28:09.040 --> 28:11.200
Well,then Ricky would
be around all the time

28:11.250 --> 28:12.980
and she could be
a 16-year-old stepmom.

28:13.040 --> 28:14.440
- Yeah.
- No,no,no.

28:14.490 --> 28:17.340
What I'm really thinking,sweetheart,

28:17.390 --> 28:19.620
there's a lot of children out there
who don't have any homes at all,

28:19.650 --> 28:21.540
and our kids are getting older every day...

28:21.580 --> 28:25.380
Yeah,and if we adopted,we wouldn't
have time to do stuff like this.

28:25.470 --> 28:26.530
You're right.

28:26.560 --> 28:28.440
What was I thinking?

28:28.480 --> 28:30.340
I told you,I don't
know what you think.

28:32.770 --> 28:34.110
And what are you thinking?

28:34.150 --> 28:37.070
I'm thinking that Tom hasn't
come in to say goodnight.

28:37.980 --> 28:40.810
And that it's 8:00 and the dishes
are still in the sink.

28:41.440 --> 28:43.410
Yep. I'm gonna go do them.
And I'll get the cookies.

28:43.430 --> 28:44.380
You want me to come with?

28:44.420 --> 28:45.720
No,thanks. I'll be right back.

28:45.760 --> 28:47.260
Okay.

28:52.090 --> 28:53.390
Hi,Mom.

28:54.010 --> 28:55.120
Hi.

28:55.720 --> 28:57.210
I see you and Tammy made up.

28:57.270 --> 28:59.390
- Hi,Tammy.
- Hi,Mom.

29:00.590 --> 29:02.420
Do you mind if I call you that?

29:02.470 --> 29:05.810
Because Tom and I are
getting married one day.

29:05.850 --> 29:08.800
Perhaps after you get married.

29:08.830 --> 29:10.990
Uh,speaking of after you get married,

29:11.030 --> 29:12.420
what have you two been up to?

29:12.450 --> 29:14.080
We've been having fun.

29:14.120 --> 29:16.070
Yeah. A lot of fun.

29:17.100 --> 29:18.490
And now we are hungry.

29:18.530 --> 29:19.870
I see.

29:19.910 --> 29:22.400
What,exactly,has made you so hungry?

29:24.400 --> 29:26.810
We've been swimming in the hot tub.

29:26.930 --> 29:28.130
Oh.

29:29.140 --> 29:31.870
Okay,good. Swimming. That's good.

29:32.550 --> 29:33.790
If Tammy can swim.

29:33.820 --> 29:35.100
I can swim.

29:35.150 --> 29:38.740
Your father and I like to know
if someone is in the pool,Tom.

29:39.220 --> 29:40.900
You know. Safety first.

29:40.930 --> 29:41.850
Buddy system.

29:41.890 --> 29:43.290
Tammy's my buddy.

29:43.330 --> 29:45.590
Yeah,okay. Well,
next time you guys go swimming,

29:45.620 --> 29:47.060
please let me know,okay?

29:47.100 --> 29:48.110
- Okay.
 - Okay.

29:48.150 --> 29:50.230
Well,I'll clean up after
you guys are finished.

29:50.270 --> 29:51.900
Why are you so hungry?

29:51.940 --> 29:53.730
Hm. Wouldn't you like to know?

29:53.780 --> 29:56.120
Goodnight.
You guys stay out of the pool.

29:56.150 --> 29:59.040
And don't have sex.

30:02.480 --> 30:06.110
Sex? She thinks we would have sex?

30:06.160 --> 30:09.940
What would you think about that?

30:09.990 --> 30:11.850
About having sex?

30:11.910 --> 30:16.490
I think I want a wedding first,
that's what I think.

30:16.540 --> 30:18.200
After the wedding?

30:18.240 --> 30:21.310
Maybe,if I feel like it.

30:21.380 --> 30:24.400
Okay,you're the boss.

30:24.450 --> 30:26.190
You got that right.

30:28.110 --> 30:31.840
So if X is half of Y,then Y equals...

30:31.880 --> 30:33.410
ABC.

30:33.820 --> 30:36.680
Come on,Duncan,stop joking around.
I know you know this stuff.

30:36.730 --> 30:37.840
I don't know this stuff,

30:37.880 --> 30:39.760
and I'm not trying
to get to know this stuff,

30:39.810 --> 30:41.790
because I am never going
to use this stuff.

30:41.820 --> 30:43.950
If nothing else,you can use
it to get into college.

30:44.010 --> 30:45.730
What? And leave all this?

30:45.790 --> 30:47.530
You can always come back to this.

30:47.580 --> 30:49.570
I'm not going to college.

30:49.610 --> 30:52.440
And I don't think you are either,Jack.

30:52.490 --> 30:54.770
Because X is not half of Y.

30:55.560 --> 30:57.880
Oh,yeah,one third of Y.

30:57.920 --> 31:00.300
Stop joking around with
this whole mentor program

31:00.350 --> 31:02.470
and admit it,you're
just here for my sister.

31:02.510 --> 31:04.660
Whoa. No,no,no. Don't go there.

31:04.690 --> 31:05.860
This is our night.

31:05.900 --> 31:08.160
I'm here for you.
This is all about you and me.

31:08.210 --> 31:10.770
Just the two of us.
Mentor and mentoree.

31:10.810 --> 31:12.850
I don't like clingy either.

31:12.890 --> 31:14.390
I need my space.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.550
All right.
I guess I'll get going,then.

31:16.610 --> 31:18.240
-Yeah.
-cool.

31:18.290 --> 31:19.890
- Night.
- I'll walk you out.

31:19.950 --> 31:21.620
All the way to the door?

31:21.660 --> 31:23.590
All three feet?

31:24.820 --> 31:26.640
- Night,Jack. 
- Goodnight,Shawna.

31:26.680 --> 31:27.770
It was nice to see you again.

31:27.820 --> 31:29.500
It was nice to see you again.

31:30.260 --> 31:32.620
- Goodnight.
- You said goodnight already.

31:37.860 --> 31:38.940
He's in high school.

31:38.990 --> 31:40.810
Yeah,I know that.

31:50.280 --> 31:51.710
What took you so long?

32:03.980 --> 32:06.060
You wanna go out
with me Wednesday night?

32:06.100 --> 32:07.290
Wednesday?

32:07.340 --> 32:08.840
Yes,Wednesday.

32:08.890 --> 32:10.340
You got a problem with Wednesday?

32:10.390 --> 32:12.300
- Well-- 
]- Forget it.

32:12.350 --> 32:14.740
No,no,no. It's just that,
my stepdad,he's a minister,

32:14.780 --> 32:16.890
and I go to church on Wednesday night.

32:16.930 --> 32:18.060
Might be hard for you to believe,

32:18.110 --> 32:21.263
considering what we did on
our first date,but,uh,

32:21.263 --> 32:24.240
I'm a Christian. There,I said it.

32:24.280 --> 32:25.110
Me too.

32:25.640 --> 32:27.930
I go to church every Wednesday night.

32:27.970 --> 32:30.330
I work on Sundays because
I get time and a half,

32:30.370 --> 32:32.270
so I go to church on Wednesday nights.

32:32.320 --> 32:34.240
I was gonna ask you to go with me.

32:34.280 --> 32:36.680
Wow. So we're both Christians.

32:36.740 --> 32:38.380
We're both sinners anyway.

32:38.430 --> 32:40.350
Yeah,but then again,
everyone's a sinner.

32:40.400 --> 32:41.930
You wanna come back in?

32:43.120 --> 32:47.070
No,I don't wanna mix Duncan's
nights with our nights.

32:47.120 --> 32:48.480
See you Wednesday?

32:57.270 --> 33:00.470
Yeah,I'll see you Wednesday.
God willing.

33:02.700 --> 33:04.220
Peace be with you.

33:04.250 --> 33:05.680
And with you.

33:20.790 --> 33:22.640
You know I'm really good at math.

33:22.670 --> 33:23.540
I know.

33:23.600 --> 33:26.200
And here's the thing. He's 16.

33:26.240 --> 33:28.620
That's 18 minus two.

33:28.660 --> 33:30.520
And you're 20.

33:30.560 --> 33:32.760
That's 18 plus two.

33:32.810 --> 33:35.220
And two,that rhymes with you.

33:35.270 --> 33:37.850
That rhymes with don't do anything
that would get you arrested,

33:37.890 --> 33:40.070
because 14 plus four equals 18,

33:40.130 --> 33:42.460
which is how old I would be
when I get out of foster care

33:42.500 --> 33:43.890
if you're in prison.

33:43.940 --> 33:45.150
I hadn't thought of that.

33:45.180 --> 33:46.160
Well,think about it.

33:46.190 --> 33:48.160
Because I'm too old to be adopted,

33:48.210 --> 33:50.690
and you're too pretty to be in prison.

33:58.260 --> 34:00.140
It's so great to see you guys.

34:00.180 --> 34:02.880
I don't know why George
didn't tell me about it.

34:02.920 --> 34:04.600
I don't know why you
didn't approach me first.

34:04.640 --> 34:06.030
I think it's a great idea.

34:06.060 --> 34:08.380
And that's exactly why we didn't
approach you first.

34:08.420 --> 34:09.730
We thought--

34:10.110 --> 34:12.989
Well,we thought George might
be an obstacle,

34:13.030 --> 34:15.739
and so we thought we should
approach him first.

34:15.770 --> 34:17.480
Me? Why would I be an obstacle?

34:17.520 --> 34:20.550
You know,George,Donovan and
I learned something important from you.

34:20.590 --> 34:23.159
Not to judge a book
by it's horrible cover.

34:25.909 --> 34:27.139
Am I that horrible?

34:29.650 --> 34:32.219
Fine. Unlike some people,
I'm not sensitive.

34:32.260 --> 34:33.510
Amy!

34:33.550 --> 34:36.139
George,I don't think Amy's
gonna talk to them tonight.

34:36.170 --> 34:37.590
That's what you get for thinking.

34:41.159 --> 34:43.080
Hi,Donovan. Hi,Leon.

34:43.120 --> 34:44.320
Hi,Amy.

34:45.179 --> 34:46.449
You look radiant.

34:55.230 --> 34:56.560
Isn't that cool?

35:06.110 --> 35:09.270
Maybe we should have waited
to have Amy talk to the guys.

35:09.310 --> 35:12.180
Waited for what?
You wanted an adoption.

35:13.290 --> 35:15.100
Do you really object,George?

35:15.760 --> 35:17.080
It's not my decision.

35:17.130 --> 35:19.460
I can't blame Amy for wanting
to get on with her life.

35:19.510 --> 35:21.820
She's not cut out to be
a mother at 15 so...

35:22.250 --> 35:24.340
It's not what I want,
but I guess it's the best thing.

35:24.770 --> 35:26.830
- I guess.
- You guess?

35:26.870 --> 35:28.410
You better be sure,
and Amy better be sure.

35:28.440 --> 35:30.750
- Once she signs the papers...
- I know.

35:32.840 --> 35:34.930
You know,Anne,I can't blame you

35:34.970 --> 35:37.110
for wanting to get on
with your life either.

35:37.140 --> 35:39.230
We had some good
years together,didn't we?

35:39.280 --> 35:41.640
Yeah,we had some
good years together.

35:41.680 --> 35:43.930
I don't think I ever said this,

35:43.970 --> 35:45.480
but I'm sorry.

35:45.530 --> 35:47.240
I'm sorry I didn't work
harder on our marriage,

35:47.290 --> 35:48.940
and I'm sorry I cheated on you.

35:48.990 --> 35:50.500
I mean that.

35:50.540 --> 35:52.980
Well,if you really mean that,
then I forgive you.

35:54.680 --> 35:56.600
And I'm sorry too.

35:57.740 --> 35:59.500
For some things that happened.

36:02.740 --> 36:05.050
Well,I don't forgive
either of you. Ever.

36:06.690 --> 36:08.690
You stink and so does Amy.

36:19.260 --> 36:21.500
Maybe Donovan and Leon can take her too.

36:23.700 --> 36:25.210
She'll be okay.

36:27.230 --> 36:28.970
We'll all be okay.

36:29.010 --> 36:30.310
Yeah.

36:32.230 --> 36:34.450
But maybe you should talk
to some other couples.

36:34.500 --> 36:35.260
Why?

36:35.290 --> 36:37.110
Because we want you to be sure.

36:37.160 --> 36:39.350
Absolutely,positively sure.

36:39.400 --> 36:40.660
I'm sure.

36:41.960 --> 36:45.940
The thing is,Amy,we almost
adopted once before.

36:45.980 --> 36:48.240
Siblings,out of foster care.

36:48.280 --> 36:50.710
We were foster parents,
and the parents agreed

36:50.750 --> 36:52.550
to relinquish the children,

36:52.600 --> 36:54.340
and then...

36:54.380 --> 36:56.640
And then they found
out that the children

36:56.680 --> 36:58.040
were with a gay couple,

36:58.070 --> 36:59.400
and they changed their mind.

36:59.450 --> 37:01.050
They didn't take the children back,

37:01.090 --> 37:02.490
they're still in foster care,

37:02.530 --> 37:04.660
but they wouldn't
let us be their parents.

37:04.730 --> 37:06.730
I know you guys are gay,
and I don't care.

37:06.780 --> 37:08.260
And I won't disappoint you.

37:08.300 --> 37:10.400
I've disappointed
enough people already.

37:10.450 --> 37:12.010
We'd like to meet Ricky.

37:12.050 --> 37:14.310
Yeah,uh,we would like to meet
him and make sure

37:14.350 --> 37:16.980
he's committed to doing this too,
because he has rights.

37:17.020 --> 37:18.530
He could block the adoption.

37:18.580 --> 37:20.140
He could,but I don't think he will.

37:20.180 --> 37:23.100
So you and Ricky,
do you still see each other?

37:23.150 --> 37:24.120
Are you friends?

37:24.150 --> 37:27.780
Donovan told me you're in
love with another guy,Ben?

37:27.810 --> 37:30.340
Yeah,I'm in love with him,

37:32.290 --> 37:34.550
I'm just not so sure
he's in love with me.

37:34.800 --> 37:36.460
Amy,don't cry.

37:36.510 --> 37:38.240
I messed up everything.

37:40.050 --> 37:42.200
I do love him.

37:49.010 --> 37:52.010
I love him,and I have a ring,

37:52.050 --> 37:53.990
and he saw me...

37:59.150 --> 38:01.220
Maybe you should talk to him,to Ben.

38:01.250 --> 38:04.940
I can't. He won't answer,
and I can't drive.

38:04.990 --> 38:06.880
Well,we'll drive you.

38:07.370 --> 38:08.410
Really?

38:08.430 --> 38:11.070
I'm dying to see where
the sausage king lives.

38:16.370 --> 38:17.680
"Mucus plug."

38:21.780 --> 38:23.070
Your mom let me in.

38:23.110 --> 38:23.900
Why?

38:23.930 --> 38:25.450
I told her I had to apologize.

38:25.500 --> 38:26.400
Why?

38:26.440 --> 38:28.340
I can't stand when someone's angry at me.

38:28.380 --> 38:29.730
Who's that? Who's angry with you?

38:29.760 --> 38:30.930
I thought you'd be angry
at me

38:30.930 --> 38:33.120
 since I told Grace
you were sleeping with Adrian.

38:33.160 --> 38:34.310
I didn't even know that.

38:34.350 --> 38:36.980
Oh. Well,I did. Sorry.

38:37.480 --> 38:39.920
What,are you in a 12-step
program or something?

38:39.970 --> 38:41.840
No,I just thought it'd be
the right thing to do.

38:41.890 --> 38:43.140
Okay.

38:48.090 --> 38:49.720
Oh,jeez,you're not
looking for me to say

38:49.760 --> 38:51.260
you're forgiven
or something,are you?

38:51.300 --> 38:52.900
- I said I didn't know.
- I know.

38:52.950 --> 38:55.620
But to me it kinda feels
like unfinished business,

38:55.660 --> 38:57.900
and until you don't say
that I'm forgiven,

38:57.950 --> 38:59.140
it still feels unfinished.

38:59.180 --> 39:02.150
Okay,you're forgiven for this
and anything you do in the future.

39:02.620 --> 39:04.040
And,hey,call next time.

39:04.070 --> 39:06.140
I don't like people in
my personal space.

39:11.290 --> 39:12.590
What? Are you studying?

39:14.570 --> 39:18.310
And this is why I don't like
people in my personal space.

39:18.340 --> 39:20.030
There's nothing wrong
with doing research.

39:20.070 --> 39:21.260
You're gonna be a father.

39:21.290 --> 39:23.540
Yeah,well,knowing
where babies come from

39:23.590 --> 39:26.970
and seeing where they come from,
two entirely different things.

39:27.010 --> 39:28.300
Yeah.

39:29.470 --> 39:31.100
Just so you know,I have a girlfriend.

39:31.570 --> 39:33.260
Her name is Shawna,and we're in love,

39:33.310 --> 39:35.410
so I'm not interested in Grace anymore.

39:35.450 --> 39:36.660
I won't be interfering again.

39:36.700 --> 39:37.640
Interfere all you want.

39:37.690 --> 39:39.680
I'm not interested in Grace anymore.

39:39.730 --> 39:41.060
Or Adrian.

39:41.110 --> 39:42.320
Who are you interested in?

39:42.370 --> 39:44.100
The mother of my son.

39:45.080 --> 39:47.350
Amy. I'm interested in Amy.

39:47.390 --> 39:48.210
For real?

39:48.260 --> 39:49.640
Yeah,for real.

39:49.700 --> 39:51.080
That's good,I guess.

39:51.120 --> 39:52.670
What about her and,uh...

39:52.710 --> 39:54.050
I think they broke up.

39:54.090 --> 39:55.590
Yeah,but Amy and Ben got married.

39:55.650 --> 39:58.340
Yeah,but Amy and I had sex
and we're having a baby.

39:58.720 --> 39:59.900
Yeah,I get it.

40:02.340 --> 40:03.420
I'm sorry.

40:15.930 --> 40:17.090
Hello?

40:17.130 --> 40:18.650
Hey,Ricky.

40:18.700 --> 40:19.910
Hi,Grace.

40:19.950 --> 40:21.410
Hey,I was wondering--

40:21.440 --> 40:23.320
Grace,I can't talk to you anymore.

40:23.360 --> 40:24.160
Are you okay?

40:24.250 --> 40:25.820
No. I can't,Grace.

40:37.820 --> 40:39.410
Hey,chica blanca. How are you?

40:39.450 --> 40:40.990
I have a confession.

40:41.030 --> 40:42.510
I called Ricky.

40:43.020 --> 40:43.840
What?

40:43.890 --> 40:45.900
And he said he can't
talk to me anymore.

40:45.950 --> 40:48.650
I thought you weren't gonna
talk to him anymore anyway.

40:48.690 --> 40:50.010
I know.

40:51.360 --> 40:53.390
All right,well,what do you want
me to do about it?

40:53.440 --> 40:55.480
I don't know.
I just wanted to tell you.

40:55.530 --> 40:57.620
All right,I'll talk to you tomorrow.

40:57.660 --> 40:59.340
And don't call him back.

40:59.380 --> 41:01.900
Just let it go. Guys like rejection.

41:01.940 --> 41:03.100
He'll come around.

41:03.130 --> 41:05.020
I don't know. He sounded serious.

41:05.060 --> 41:07.480
He's never serious.
I'll see you tomorrow.

41:07.510 --> 41:08.470
Bye.

41:15.630 --> 41:16.400
What?

41:16.450 --> 41:17.580
What do you mean,what?

41:17.620 --> 41:18.750
You wanna come over?

41:18.780 --> 41:20.560
No,I'm not coming over there anymore.

41:20.590 --> 41:22.250
Yeah,right.

41:22.280 --> 41:23.430
What about your brother?

41:23.480 --> 41:24.760
If that's why you're not coming over,

41:24.810 --> 41:26.110
I can get rid of him.

41:26.160 --> 41:27.280
You don't have to.

41:27.320 --> 41:29.020
This is it for us,Adrian. I'm done.

41:51.350 --> 41:53.340
Amy,hi. We weren't expecting you.

41:53.380 --> 41:54.830
I couldn't get Ben on the phone.

41:54.870 --> 41:56.520
I really need to talk to him.

42:04.290 --> 42:06.710
Look,Amy,you know I love you.

42:07.080 --> 42:08.512
You're a nice girl,

42:08.512 --> 42:11.580
and I don't care at all
that you're having a baby.

42:11.610 --> 42:16.140
In fact,I love you both,
but I also love my son.

42:16.180 --> 42:18.054
The truth is ,it may not be
 the best thing for him

42:18.054 --> 42:19.780
if you two are together.

42:20.590 --> 42:23.440
That's a decision he's gonna
have to make himself.

42:24.420 --> 42:27.210
He'd like some time to make
that decision himself.

42:27.270 --> 42:28.290
Okay,Amy?

42:28.860 --> 42:31.890
Yeah. Okay.

42:33.510 --> 42:35.560
Thanks,Mr. Boykewich.

42:35.610 --> 42:37.210
Goodnight,Amy.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
