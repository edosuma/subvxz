Don't be afraid, my friend.

02:39.687 --> 02:41.638
I can't.

02:45.276 --> 02:47.895
You know, buddy,

02:47.979 --> 02:49.530
I got to tell you,
I'd be way more impressed

02:49.614 --> 02:50.731
with your ninja skills

02:50.815 --> 02:52.566
if A) the door
was locked,

02:52.650 --> 02:54.318
and B) you didn't call
and get the room number.

02:54.369 --> 02:56.186
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint.
Next time, I'll come

02:56.237 --> 02:57.821
through the window, okay?
Oh, wait a minute.

02:57.872 --> 02:59.022
There are no windows.

02:59.073 --> 03:00.190
Do me a favor, please.

03:00.241 --> 03:01.325
Okay, this is
obviously temporary

03:01.376 --> 03:02.743
until I find something
different,

03:02.827 --> 03:03.961
and more importantly than that,
this place isn't haunted.

03:04.028 --> 03:05.128
Not haunted?

03:05.196 --> 03:06.880
You run a blue light
over this apartment,

03:06.965 --> 03:08.665
the last thing
you're gonna be worried about

03:08.716 --> 03:09.833
is ghosts, my friend.

03:09.884 --> 03:11.001
You what I'm saying?

03:11.052 --> 03:12.586
Mmm.

03:12.670 --> 03:14.671
What are we watching?

03:14.722 --> 03:15.889
<i>Enemy Mine?</i>
Mm-hmm.

03:15.974 --> 03:17.558
That's awesome.

03:17.642 --> 03:19.226
I feel like
I'm in a time machine.

03:19.310 --> 03:22.646
Like a tiny, little, really
badly-decorated time machine.

03:22.713 --> 03:24.181
Okay.

03:24.249 --> 03:25.315
I like this movie.

03:25.383 --> 03:26.716
Okay?

03:26.768 --> 03:28.435
I think it's a classic.
You have to pause...

03:28.519 --> 03:29.886
Buh-buh.
If you're gonna be here,

03:29.938 --> 03:32.322
I'm gonna have to ask
you to sit quietly

03:32.390 --> 03:34.408
and give this cinematic
masterpiece

03:34.492 --> 03:35.742
the attention it deserves, okay?

03:35.827 --> 03:37.244
- Can you do that?
- Yup.

03:37.328 --> 03:38.912
Thank you.

03:44.452 --> 03:46.403
Oh.

03:46.454 --> 03:48.622
That's disgusting.

03:58.816 --> 04:00.951
You okay?

04:01.019 --> 04:02.803
Huh?

04:02.887 --> 04:04.421
I mean, you want a tissue
or something?

04:06.190 --> 04:07.274
What's the matter?

04:07.358 --> 04:08.558
Nothing's the matter.

04:08.610 --> 04:09.943
You weren't moved by that

04:10.028 --> 04:12.362
little moment right
there, that scene?

04:12.430 --> 04:13.814
Evidently not as much as you.

04:13.898 --> 04:15.198
Oh, well, I'm sorry.

04:15.266 --> 04:18.317
Okay, I'm sorry that I got
drawn in to a beautiful film

04:18.403 --> 04:20.320
about sacrifice
and friendship.

04:20.404 --> 04:21.704
- I apologize.
- The dude just gave birth.

04:21.772 --> 04:23.707
He's an alien, okay?

04:23.774 --> 04:25.108
They got different
plumbing on this planet.

04:25.159 --> 04:26.326
Okay, I don't know.

04:26.411 --> 04:27.577
They're all hermaphrodites
or whatever.

04:27.629 --> 04:29.162
I just didn't understand
why you were crying, okay?

04:29.247 --> 04:30.664
- It's kind of like... I mean...
- I'm not... Did I cry?

04:30.748 --> 04:32.132
You know what? Forget it.
Forget it. Forget it.

04:32.216 --> 04:33.450
Forget it. You don't
know what it's like

04:33.518 --> 04:34.801
to be a father,
you don't understand.

04:34.886 --> 04:36.303
You know what I could do?
I'll find a cartoon.

04:36.387 --> 04:37.654
Okay, speaking of cartoons,

04:37.722 --> 04:39.139
are you planning
on bringing Gracie here?

04:39.223 --> 04:40.390
Because if you are,

04:40.458 --> 04:42.843
as a law enforcement official,
I'm required

04:42.927 --> 04:44.961
to call the Department
of Child Protective Services.

04:45.013 --> 04:46.897
Oh, you think you're funny.

04:46.964 --> 04:48.732
I'm gonna give it
a medium. It's okay.

04:48.799 --> 04:50.100
A cultureless...

04:50.151 --> 04:51.301
Shh. McGarrett.

04:51.352 --> 04:52.569
...animal.

04:52.636 --> 04:54.988
Yeah, we're on the way.

04:55.073 --> 04:56.523
Put your shoes on.

05:00.078 --> 05:01.995
The victim's name is
Monica Jennsen, 28.

05:02.080 --> 05:03.697
She was an ICE agent.

05:03.781 --> 05:05.648
Body was brought ashore
by the Coast Guard.

05:05.700 --> 05:08.141
This is Special Agent in Charge,
Jeff Morrison, her supervisor.

05:08.142 --> 05:09.196
How you doing?

05:09.221 --> 05:10.337
Wish we would have met under
better circumstances.

05:10.638 --> 05:12.589
Lori's told me a lot
about you guys and your team.

05:12.656 --> 05:13.757
Oh, so you guys
know each other?

05:13.824 --> 05:14.758
We worked together

05:14.825 --> 05:16.043
on a federal task force
a few years ago.

05:16.127 --> 05:17.377
We're really sorry
to hear you lost an agent.

05:17.462 --> 05:18.828
I appreciate that.

05:18.880 --> 05:19.880
What makes you guys think

05:19.947 --> 05:21.048
that this was anything more

05:21.132 --> 05:22.382
than mechanical problems
with the plane?

05:22.467 --> 05:23.550
Initially, I did think that,

05:23.634 --> 05:24.834
but then I got on scene,
and they said

05:24.886 --> 05:26.019
the medical examiner
has concerns

05:26.104 --> 05:27.187
about possible
foul play.

05:27.271 --> 05:28.555
Max is with the body
at the end of the pier.

05:28.639 --> 05:31.841
Okay. And now
she was the only one on board?

05:31.893 --> 05:33.377
Yeah, just her. The
surfers that pulled her

05:33.444 --> 05:34.911
from the plane are pretty
positive about that.

05:34.979 --> 05:36.246
None of this
makes any sense.

05:36.314 --> 05:37.531
She wasn't even
scheduled to fly today.

05:37.615 --> 05:39.266
What kind of case
was Jennsen working on lately?

05:39.333 --> 05:40.484
Mostly routine stuff.

05:40.535 --> 05:41.868
Comparing shipping numbers

05:41.953 --> 05:43.704
and cargo weights
to customs manifest.

05:43.788 --> 05:45.372
And if she came
across something unusual,

05:45.456 --> 05:47.040
she was supposed
to loop me in.

05:47.125 --> 05:49.443
You think maybe she got in over
her head this time?

05:49.510 --> 05:51.812
Maybe. She was a quick study,
eager to impress,

05:51.879 --> 05:53.213
but she was definitely green.

05:53.297 --> 05:54.715
What about her red book?
Can we see that?

05:54.782 --> 05:56.633
Yeah, I can get that
out of her office.

05:56.700 --> 05:58.752
Wait, wait, wait.
What's a red book?

05:58.836 --> 06:00.721
It's an investigator's
day-to-day diary.

06:00.805 --> 06:02.372
They turn it into their
supervisor at the end of

06:02.423 --> 06:03.724
the week so we know exactly
what they've been working on.

06:03.808 --> 06:05.225
All right, we're definitely
gonna need that,

06:05.309 --> 06:06.543
plus, any active case files.

06:06.594 --> 06:07.844
Absolutely.
Whatever you guys need.

06:07.895 --> 06:09.763
All right, great. Thanks.

06:12.984 --> 06:14.985
Hey.

06:15.052 --> 06:16.386
We know anything yet?

06:16.437 --> 06:18.939
All I can give you right now are
my preliminary observations.

06:19.023 --> 06:20.907
However, it's exactly
those observations

06:20.992 --> 06:22.442
that give me reason for concern.

06:22.527 --> 06:24.227
As you can see,
the victim

06:24.278 --> 06:25.746
show signs of swelling
around the tongue

06:25.830 --> 06:28.081
and tenseness
around the throat muscles.

06:28.166 --> 06:30.083
There's no bruising
from the impact,

06:30.168 --> 06:32.419
or water in the lungs,
which leads me to believe

06:32.503 --> 06:33.920
that she was dead
before the impact.

06:34.005 --> 06:35.288
And I'm thinking COD

06:35.373 --> 06:36.590
was most likely poisoning.

06:36.674 --> 06:38.091
And what about TOD?

06:38.176 --> 06:39.543
Well, based on
liver temperature,

06:39.594 --> 06:41.595
I'd say at least
eight hours ago.

06:41.679 --> 06:42.796
What kind of plane was she in?

06:42.880 --> 06:44.414
A Cessna 177 Cardinal.

06:44.465 --> 06:46.416
177?

06:46.467 --> 06:48.101
You sure about that?
Positive. Why?

06:48.186 --> 06:49.970
Because the Cessna
177's fuel tank

06:50.054 --> 06:53.190
gives it a maximum flight time
of just over four hours.

06:53.257 --> 06:54.691
So she couldn't have
been flying the plane.

06:54.758 --> 06:56.943
That's right.
Agent Jennsen was dead

06:57.028 --> 06:58.478
long before that plane
even took off.

07:16.921 --> 07:19.473
Jeff?

07:22.560 --> 07:24.561
Jeff?

07:25.597 --> 07:28.315
Yeah, I looked, um...

07:28.382 --> 07:30.550
looked everywhere,
and her... her, um...

07:30.602 --> 07:32.552
her red book's not in here.

07:32.604 --> 07:34.905
Maybe she took it home with her.

07:36.491 --> 07:38.492
Yeah. Maybe.

07:40.528 --> 07:42.196
Listen, I'm sorry.

07:42.247 --> 07:44.248
It's, um...

07:44.332 --> 07:47.000
It's always tough losing someone
you work with.

07:48.036 --> 07:50.370
Yeah.

07:54.759 --> 07:56.760
Monica reminded me a lot of you.

07:58.246 --> 08:01.381
Hardworking, motivated,
stubborn.

08:03.218 --> 08:05.252
All in the best possible way,
of course.

08:05.303 --> 08:07.638
Of course.

08:10.225 --> 08:13.560
She did not deserve

08:13.611 --> 08:15.696
to die like this.

08:15.763 --> 08:17.731
I know.

08:17.782 --> 08:20.534
We're going to find
who did this, I promise.

08:22.153 --> 08:24.204
I want to help.

08:27.876 --> 08:29.827
So, I've been scanning
through Jennsen's case file.

08:29.911 --> 08:31.128
It's just like Morrison said.

08:31.212 --> 08:32.663
It's all lightweight stuff.

08:32.746 --> 08:34.131
Tracking shipping containers,
verifying way bills.

08:34.215 --> 08:35.599
So what got
her killed?

08:35.667 --> 08:37.100
What about the
plane's recovery?

08:37.168 --> 08:39.052
The NTSB investigative team
isn't due

08:39.120 --> 08:40.754
to arrive on site
until later today.

08:40.804 --> 08:41.977
All right, well, listen.

08:41.977 --> 08:42.746
Speed that up, okay?

08:42.746 --> 08:44.211
We need to find out what's
on that flight recorder.

08:44.303 --> 08:45.359
Roger that.

08:45.384 --> 08:47.447
Hey. Did you get
Jennsen's red book?

08:47.628 --> 08:48.846
Not yet.
It wasn't in her office.

08:48.930 --> 08:50.013
I'm gonna try her home.

08:50.098 --> 08:51.265
Danny and I will meet you there.

08:51.316 --> 08:52.483
Okay.

09:02.476 --> 09:04.477
Okay.

09:08.032 --> 09:09.016
Whoa.

09:10.435 --> 09:13.003
Hey. Hey, hey.

09:13.071 --> 09:16.039
Yeah, you got good taste
in humans, huh?

09:16.991 --> 09:18.091
What are you doing?

09:22.931 --> 09:25.665
He's waiting for Agent
Jennsen to come home.

09:25.717 --> 09:27.167
All right,

09:27.218 --> 09:30.003
Danny, take the kitchen,
we'll take the living room.

09:30.054 --> 09:32.055
Let's find that
red book.

09:52.827 --> 09:55.012
I've got signs of forced
entry through the back window.

09:55.079 --> 09:57.297
Can you believe this?
Somebody tried to drug

09:57.365 --> 10:00.050
the dog. I'd like
to kill them.

10:00.134 --> 10:01.919
Geez. Doesn't look like
the place was tossed.

10:02.003 --> 10:03.420
Well, maybe they knew exactly
what they were coming for.

10:03.504 --> 10:04.922
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Take a look at this.

10:05.006 --> 10:06.974
These are surveillance photos.

10:07.041 --> 10:09.593
Maybe it's a case

10:09.677 --> 10:11.044
she was working on.
Yeah. I mean,

10:11.095 --> 10:12.930
definitely a fresh case.
Look at the date stamp.

10:13.014 --> 10:15.732
It's two days ago.
Guys, I found the red book.

10:17.685 --> 10:19.987
That's weird.
Last few pages are torn out.

10:20.054 --> 10:21.772
- No way Jennsen did this.
- Whoa, whoa. Why do you say that?

10:21.856 --> 10:23.223
These books--
they're subject to subpoena.

10:23.274 --> 10:24.908
By law, they have
to remain intact.

10:24.993 --> 10:26.744
She wouldn't risk losing a case
over missing pages.

10:26.813 --> 10:28.374
Maybe that's what the burglar
was after.

10:28.399 --> 10:29.900
Whoa, whoa. What kind of a moron
would break into a house,

10:30.100 --> 10:31.601
try to drug a dog,
just to get some pages

10:31.685 --> 10:33.052
out of a book?
I don't know.

10:33.103 --> 10:34.770
I mean, you're better off
just taking the whole thing.

10:34.855 --> 10:35.988
All right, listen, we need

10:36.056 --> 10:37.657
to get this stuff back
and analyzed.

10:37.724 --> 10:39.242
Lori, have Fong
run that book for prints.

10:39.326 --> 10:40.776
Okay.

10:40.861 --> 10:42.561
Come here, buddy.

10:42.613 --> 10:44.914
Oh, I got you. Come here.

10:44.998 --> 10:46.082
Hey, what are you
doing, Danny?

10:46.149 --> 10:47.250
What do you mean,
what am I doing?

10:47.334 --> 10:48.417
The CSU's on their
way right now.

10:48.502 --> 10:49.952
This guy's contaminating
a crime scene.

10:50.037 --> 10:51.420
We got to take
him with us.

10:51.488 --> 10:53.322
He's not riding in the car.

10:53.390 --> 10:54.924
What do you want me to do,
tie him to the bumper?

10:55.008 --> 10:56.909
Come on.

11:01.381 --> 11:04.050
Can you explain to me again
why I'm sitting in the back

11:04.101 --> 11:06.028
and the dog is riding shotgun?

11:06.053 --> 11:07.436
I already told you,
he needs the window.

11:07.437 --> 11:10.556
Oh, yes, right. How else is he
gonna enjoy his tour of Waikiki?

11:10.607 --> 11:13.442
You know, for your
information, dogs get carsick.

11:13.527 --> 11:14.810
Really?
Yeah, it's a fact.

11:14.895 --> 11:16.195
Oh, it's a fact?
Yeah.

11:16.262 --> 11:18.197
So, all of a sudden
you're a dog expert?

11:18.264 --> 11:20.066
No, not all of a sudden;
I've had dogs my entire life.

11:20.117 --> 11:21.951
Really? You didn't have
a dog when I met you.

11:22.019 --> 11:24.203
Yes, I did, but I lost the dog
in the divorce.

11:24.270 --> 11:25.738
Rachel got custody of my dog.

11:25.789 --> 11:27.623
What happened to it?

11:27.708 --> 11:29.408
He was old.

11:29.459 --> 11:31.627
He died in the
quarantine process.

11:31.695 --> 11:34.880
Which is another reason why I
hate this miserable island.

11:35.916 --> 11:38.250
Guess that makes two of you.

11:38.302 --> 11:41.587
Yeah, buddy, I knew I liked
this guy for a reason.

11:43.940 --> 11:46.909
Here's what Agent Jennsen
had on her camera.

11:46.977 --> 11:50.396
She took about eight photos.
All of the same guy.

11:50.464 --> 11:52.898
Okay, can you punch in closer?
I can do better than that.

11:54.968 --> 11:56.352
I'll run his face through

11:56.420 --> 11:58.254
DMV database
using facial recognition.

11:58.322 --> 11:59.605
You read my mind.

12:07.247 --> 12:08.197
All right, we got a match.

12:08.281 --> 12:10.900
Liam Miller, 40.

12:10.967 --> 12:12.201
NCIC shows no
criminal record.

12:12.285 --> 12:13.869
Not even a speeding ticket.

12:13.954 --> 12:16.172
Why would Agent Jennsen follow
around a guy like that?

12:16.256 --> 12:19.125
Maybe he's
an ex-boyfriend.

12:19.176 --> 12:20.593
All right, thank you very much.

12:20.660 --> 12:21.927
That was the Coast Guard.

12:21.995 --> 12:23.929
They're at the crash site
pulling the black box

12:23.997 --> 12:25.270
from Jennsen's plane right now
We gotta to.

12:25.295 --> 12:26.298
What about Liam Miller?

12:26.299 --> 12:27.550
Kono, grab Chin, see if you can
find Miller.

12:27.634 --> 12:29.435
And I want to find out
why Jennsen was following him.

12:29.502 --> 12:30.953
- Yeah. Okay.
- Ready?

12:31.021 --> 12:34.023
Whoa. Hold up a second.
What are you doing with the dog?

12:34.107 --> 12:35.524
I'm gonna take him
to an animal shelter.

12:35.609 --> 12:38.611
When?
When I have time.

12:45.702 --> 12:47.636
<i>Mr. Miller, we just need</i>

12:47.704 --> 12:49.705
to ask you some questions
about Agent Jennsen.

12:49.790 --> 12:52.158
Oh, yeah, I... ah,
I saw that on the news.

12:52.209 --> 12:53.459
What a horrible accident.

12:53.526 --> 12:55.244
It wasn't an accident--
she was murdered.

12:56.830 --> 12:59.799
Murdered? Oh, my...

13:02.535 --> 13:04.420
Is that pakalolo?

13:04.504 --> 13:05.955
Huh...

13:06.022 --> 13:07.089
Oh... yeah.

13:07.174 --> 13:09.759
Oh, sorry. Um...

13:09.843 --> 13:11.727
Yeah, here's my card.

13:11.812 --> 13:14.096
I have a doctor prescription.

13:14.181 --> 13:16.265
I'm a cancer patient.

13:16.349 --> 13:21.654
I use medical marijuana to help
with my anxiety and appetite.

13:21.721 --> 13:24.523
The chemo side effects
were pretty brutal.

13:24.574 --> 13:25.741
Sorry to hear it.

13:25.809 --> 13:27.743
Well, well, it's okay.

13:27.828 --> 13:31.180
They say I'm one of the lucky
ones; my tumor's shrinking.

13:31.248 --> 13:34.166
So how did you meet
Agent Jennsen?

13:34.234 --> 13:36.869
Well, uh, she
came to talk to me

13:36.920 --> 13:38.454
a few days ago,
asked for my help.

13:38.538 --> 13:41.740
She was investigating a smoke
shop where I buy marijuana.

13:41.792 --> 13:44.576
Did Agent Jennsen give you any
details as to why she was

13:44.628 --> 13:47.463
investigating a place that
sold medical marijuana?

13:47.547 --> 13:50.382
The smoke shop's not exactly
a legitimate caregiver.

13:50.434 --> 13:54.103
I guess Agent Jennsen thought
they were selling to anyone.

13:54.187 --> 13:56.889
Not just cardholders like me.

13:56.940 --> 14:00.693
Oh. Here's the... actually...

14:00.760 --> 14:04.480
Here's the place.

14:04.564 --> 14:07.450
She said she was gonna get back
to me, but she never did, so...

14:07.534 --> 14:10.736
I just assumed that she handled
the problem without me.

14:10.787 --> 14:13.939
Yeah, unfortunately,
she never had the chance to.

14:17.160 --> 14:19.361
I've handled cases
like this before.

14:19.429 --> 14:21.397
There's a lot of money in
selling medicinal marijuana.

14:21.465 --> 14:23.115
Enough to kill an
ICE agent over?

14:26.720 --> 14:27.720
Hey.

14:29.622 --> 14:32.341
That sounds like a plan.

14:32.425 --> 14:34.510
Uh, let me call you back later.

14:34.594 --> 14:36.595
Me, too.

14:38.098 --> 14:39.631
What?

14:43.487 --> 14:45.104
You don't have to keep
it a secret.

14:45.155 --> 14:47.606
I know you're back with Malia.

14:49.309 --> 14:51.744
Relax, cuz.
I'm cool with it.

14:51.811 --> 14:53.746
You are?

14:53.813 --> 14:55.281
Yeah.

14:55.332 --> 14:57.583
When did you turn the
corner on that one?

14:57.650 --> 15:01.837
When I was relieved of duty,
she came to my house

15:01.922 --> 15:03.493
'cause you were
worried about me.

15:03.518 --> 15:04.489
Really?

15:04.490 --> 15:07.293
That's when I realized
she still loved you.

15:10.881 --> 15:12.464
Are you as hungry as I am?

15:12.516 --> 15:15.726
What, you got the munchies?

15:15.727 --> 15:17.022
I could eat the whole
left side of the Side

15:17.047 --> 15:18.003
Street menu right now.

15:18.004 --> 15:19.688
You got a contact high
from Miller's place.

15:19.773 --> 15:21.357
I know this shirt I'm wearing
reeks of it.

15:21.441 --> 15:23.108
Oh, I guess that's good, right?

15:23.176 --> 15:25.277
Means we'll fit right in
at the smoke shop.

15:25.345 --> 15:26.979
Let's go.

15:29.900 --> 15:31.850
Here you go, Commander.

15:31.902 --> 15:34.853
All right, good.

15:34.905 --> 15:37.740
You are aware that that's
an orange box, right?

15:37.807 --> 15:40.876
Yeah, they call it a black box,
but they paint 'em orange

15:40.961 --> 15:43.329
to help recovery teams like
that find them more easily.

15:43.380 --> 15:44.423
You check in with Lori?

15:44.448 --> 15:46.482
Yeah, Max narrowed down
the COD on Jennsen.

15:46.483 --> 15:49.251
She's gonna go over there with
Morrison and get the results.

15:51.137 --> 15:52.338
Hey, Max.

15:52.389 --> 15:54.490
Oh, aloha.

15:55.742 --> 15:57.593
Do I know you?

15:57.677 --> 15:59.328
No, I don't think so.

15:59.396 --> 16:02.698
Oh, yes.
I-I think we've met before.

16:02.766 --> 16:05.434
No. I think I would have
remembered a guy like you.

16:05.518 --> 16:08.153
Well, I'm rarely wrong about
previous human encounters.

16:08.221 --> 16:10.856
You are...

16:13.226 --> 16:14.526
Jeff Morrison.

16:14.578 --> 16:16.362
It was my agent who was killed.

16:16.413 --> 16:18.914
Oh. I'm sorry for your loss.

16:18.999 --> 16:20.749
Thank you.

16:20.834 --> 16:23.252
So, Max, you said on the phone
you... you got something for us?

16:23.336 --> 16:25.754
Yes. I have positively
identified

16:25.839 --> 16:28.007
the killer of
Agent Jennsen.

16:29.409 --> 16:30.926
Good.
Great. Who is it?

16:31.011 --> 16:32.711
Right this way.

16:37.250 --> 16:41.804
Wow, Max, you...
you fooled me.

16:41.888 --> 16:45.190
I was certain there was a very
tiny, tiny body under there.

16:45.258 --> 16:46.775
Well, technically, it is.

16:46.860 --> 16:48.260
Let me explain.

16:48.311 --> 16:51.530
This is a body of a
fully-grown puffer fish.

16:51.597 --> 16:53.582
Highly poisonous,
and according to my

16:53.650 --> 16:56.452
chemical calculations,
the origin of the substance

16:56.536 --> 16:58.537
utilized by the murderer
to kill the victim.

16:58.605 --> 16:59.788
It looks harmless.

16:59.873 --> 17:02.541
Ah, looks can be very deceiving,
Agent Morrison.

17:02.608 --> 17:05.739
A small puffer fish
like this has enough toxin

17:05.763 --> 17:06.964
to kill 30 human beings.

17:07.213 --> 17:10.582
A fish just like this was milked
for its poison, and then

17:10.634 --> 17:13.335
that poison was ingested orally
by Agent Jennsen.

17:13.420 --> 17:16.805
Most likely with a hot beverage
of some sort to disguise

17:16.890 --> 17:18.390
the bitterness,
like a coffee or tea.

17:18.458 --> 17:20.142
None of this makes any sense,
though.

17:20.226 --> 17:22.011
Who would have access
to something like this?

17:22.095 --> 17:24.963
Well, I really haven't thought
about that.

17:25.015 --> 17:28.133
Spearfishermen would avoid them
for obvious reasons.

17:28.184 --> 17:31.987
And apart from a few select
Japanese chefs who are licensed

17:32.072 --> 17:34.990
to serve the nonpoisonous part
as a delicacy,

17:35.075 --> 17:36.641
I don't know.

17:36.693 --> 17:38.160
Good luck.

17:39.746 --> 17:40.946
Thanks, Max.

17:44.417 --> 17:46.201
♪ ♪

18:05.305 --> 18:06.939
Hey.

18:07.006 --> 18:09.775
So... from what I hear,

18:09.842 --> 18:13.512
you're the guy to talk to about
a little medicinal herb.

18:13.563 --> 18:16.565
Is that right?
Who did you hear that from?

18:16.649 --> 18:18.850
From a guy named Miller.

18:18.902 --> 18:20.953
I burn fatties with him
once a week.

18:21.020 --> 18:23.539
He said even if I don't
have my medical card...

18:25.408 --> 18:27.859
...Brody would be
able to hook me up.

18:27.911 --> 18:31.547
Look... Liam,
he's a good customer,

18:31.631 --> 18:34.032
but he can't be telling
everybody about this place.

18:34.084 --> 18:39.037
We're trying to stay under
the radar, know what I mean?

18:39.089 --> 18:42.307
I won't tell anyone.

18:42.375 --> 18:46.562
Just keep it a little
secret between you and me.

18:48.264 --> 18:50.566
You want to keep secrets
with me, don't you?

18:59.743 --> 19:01.693
What's your name, girl?

19:01.745 --> 19:04.830
It's definitely not girl.
It's Officer Kalakaua.

19:04.897 --> 19:07.666
You're under arrest for sales
to a police officer.

19:07.733 --> 19:09.752
Damn! I knew you were a cop.

19:09.836 --> 19:11.754
Yeah, sure you did.

19:14.541 --> 19:17.292
Now, sales to an undercover is
a hard case to beat, Brody,

19:17.377 --> 19:21.213
but maybe if you help us,
we can cut you some slack.

19:21.264 --> 19:22.965
Have you spoken
to this woman before?

19:23.049 --> 19:26.552
I ain't speaking to you.
You lied to me.

19:26.603 --> 19:30.389
Then talk to me.
Do you know that woman?

19:30.440 --> 19:34.693
I don't know her, and I ain't
speaking to any cops.

19:34.760 --> 19:37.446
I want my lawyer.

19:40.066 --> 19:42.601
No problem.

19:42.652 --> 19:45.154
But I'm seizing the security
footage from your back room.

19:45.238 --> 19:47.122
And if the woman we're asking
you about is on it,

19:47.207 --> 19:49.408
and you're lying to us,
you're gonna be looking

19:49.459 --> 19:52.077
at a lot more
than a sales case.

19:52.128 --> 19:53.712
Walk!

19:55.582 --> 19:57.216
I'm not seeing her.

19:57.283 --> 20:00.068
Maybe Brody was
telling the truth.

20:00.136 --> 20:01.887
Okay, guys, I just got off
the phone with Fong.

20:01.954 --> 20:03.755
He lifted a foreign print
from the red book.

20:03.807 --> 20:07.092
Jason Akita.
He's a two-striker.

20:07.160 --> 20:09.511
Greatest hits include burglary
and narcotic sales.

20:09.596 --> 20:12.714
Hey. We're gonna need the data
off this as soon as possible.

20:12.782 --> 20:13.899
Who's this guy?

20:13.966 --> 20:16.285
I've seen him before.

20:23.576 --> 20:24.693
There.

20:27.864 --> 20:30.499
Time stamp shows he was at the
smoke shop three days ago.

20:30.583 --> 20:32.501
That and the fact that his print
was found on her red book

20:32.585 --> 20:34.036
makes him
a pretty damn good suspect.

20:34.120 --> 20:36.321
Exactly, and you said
he's a two-striker?

20:36.372 --> 20:38.507
That means one more felony
pop and he goes away

20:38.591 --> 20:40.158
for life without the
possibility of parole.

20:40.210 --> 20:42.261
You don't get a better motive
for murder than that.

20:52.945 --> 20:55.647
What part of "Don't move"
did he not understand, huh?

21:13.249 --> 21:14.749
Stay on him.

21:20.439 --> 21:23.508
- Lori, bag!
- Got it!

21:35.938 --> 21:38.023
Drop something?

21:38.835 --> 21:40.370
I got pills and powder.

21:41.777 --> 21:43.511
Hey, look at that.

21:43.562 --> 21:46.781
Let's go for a walk.

21:49.618 --> 21:51.569
I don't know nothing
about no murder, man.

21:51.654 --> 21:53.238
I'm-I'm just a courier.

21:53.322 --> 21:56.207
I take packages from point A
to point B.

21:56.292 --> 21:58.710
Oh, yeah? You're just an
innocent drug mule, is that

21:58.794 --> 22:00.128
what you're saying?

22:00.195 --> 22:02.664
Oh, I... I don't look at what
they give me, brah.

22:02.715 --> 22:04.466
I learned that from being
a pizza delivery guy

22:04.533 --> 22:06.301
on the North Shore.
If you don't know what's

22:06.368 --> 22:07.869
inside the box,
they can't blame you

22:07.920 --> 22:09.087
for screwing up the order.

22:09.171 --> 22:10.255
Shut your mouth.

22:10.339 --> 22:12.173
Now listen to what
I tell you, all right?

22:12.224 --> 22:15.343
You kill a cop on this island,
we take it really personally.

22:15.394 --> 22:17.512
So you should start
talking to me now.

22:17.563 --> 22:19.230
We know you were at her house.

22:19.315 --> 22:20.815
We got your prints to prove it.

22:22.318 --> 22:23.735
Okay.

22:23.819 --> 22:26.071
Here's the deal. I'm gonna

22:26.155 --> 22:27.572
give it to you
straight, brahs.

22:27.656 --> 22:28.990
I broke in
to that house

22:29.058 --> 22:31.326
because I was working
as an informant to Ms. Jennsen.

22:33.079 --> 22:34.579
Well, that makes
zero sense.

22:34.663 --> 22:37.082
It's the truth.
As soon as I found out that she

22:37.166 --> 22:39.200
was killed in that plane crash
in the news, I remembered

22:39.251 --> 22:41.336
that she had written my name
down in that book of hers.

22:41.403 --> 22:43.288
You were trying to get it back?

the autopilot was engaged.

24:21.681 --> 24:23.181

he exit the aircraft?

what you're looking for.

32:55.846 --> 32:58.348
You just said five seconds ago
that you don't know anybody.

32:58.432 --> 33:00.800
Well, you asked me if
I knew any poachers.

33:00.851 --> 33:02.852
That's like asking me
if I know anybody

33:02.936 --> 33:04.153
that kills cows.

33:04.238 --> 33:05.488
I don't.

Now, talk!

- Funny, huh, <i>haole.</i> Funny.
- Nah, he's kidding.

got a shrimp tail

the matter with you,

You wanted me to give
him real shrimp

Somebody grabbed
the doctor.

For what?

was tying up loose ends.

our doctor is our killer,

sloppy all of a sudden?
