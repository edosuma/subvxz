00:02.000 --> 00:07.560
This programme contains
strong language 

00:19.240 --> 00:22.360
FOOTBALL CROWD ROARS

00:25.960 --> 00:29.200
MUSIC PLAYING

01:01.560 --> 01:03.040
FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING

01:03.040 --> 01:05.120
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Sorry, Ref.

01:05.120 --> 01:06.280
The door was open.

01:06.280 --> 01:07.760
What can I do for you, Mitch?

01:07.760 --> 01:09.520
Well, I'm just checking with
you

01:09.520 --> 01:11.400
if it's OK for me to be
pitch-side during the match.

01:11.400 --> 01:13.200
You know, get the crowd
going and everything.

01:13.200 --> 01:14.520
Not during the game, no.

01:14.520 --> 01:17.000
Pre-match, half-time only.
Oh.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.280
It's just that Rovers have brought
Scotty the Shrimp.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.440
I thought we could get a bit
of play-fighting going, you know?

01:21.440 --> 01:24.360
In jest, like, have a laugh.
No, I can't allow it. I'm sorry.

01:24.360 --> 01:25.680
I'm not having the players
distracted by

01:25.680 --> 01:28.160
a six-foot prawn knocking
seven shades of shite
out of a...

01:28.160 --> 01:30.280
..whatever it is you are.

01:30.280 --> 01:31.920
This is not America, Mitch.

01:31.920 --> 01:33.240
I understand.

01:33.240 --> 01:35.880
Hey, it's your last-ever game
today, isn't it?

01:35.880 --> 01:37.160
It is, yes.

01:37.160 --> 01:39.840
Well, I just want to say it's been
an absolute privilege to work
with you.

01:39.840 --> 01:40.920
Fantastic.

01:40.920 --> 01:43.800
And may the best team win.

01:43.800 --> 01:45.320
Indeed.

01:48.160 --> 01:50.560
TOILET FLUSHES

01:53.680 --> 01:55.720
I'd give it a minute
before you go in there.

01:55.720 --> 01:57.440
A few, er, pre-match nerves.

01:57.440 --> 01:59.440
Well, it's a big game, isn't it?

01:59.440 --> 02:02.520
It is. When I worked
at the San Siro,

02:02.520 --> 02:05.080
the WC was adjacent to the
showers with a separate door,

02:05.080 --> 02:07.160
and it had a self-lowering
lavatory seat.

02:07.160 --> 02:08.440
You felt pampered.

02:08.440 --> 02:10.880
You're really early. What time
is it?

02:10.880 --> 02:12.920
1:58:59.

02:12.920 --> 02:15.840
I like to be fully uniformed
before the captains' meeting.

02:15.840 --> 02:17.760
Gives me that extra degree of
authority.

02:17.760 --> 02:20.400
Oh, most definitely. I've known some
refs slumming round

02:20.400 --> 02:22.200
in sweat pants with a beer
in their hand

02:22.200 --> 02:24.240
at 20 to three like they're at
a family barbecue.

02:24.240 --> 02:27.920
No, you're one of the pros, Martin.
A role model. I've always said it.

02:27.920 --> 02:29.760
That's why you've lasted
as long as you have.

02:29.760 --> 02:31.120
Thank you, Brendan,
I appreciate that.

02:31.120 --> 02:33.440
Was that Mitch I could hear
just now? It was.

02:33.440 --> 02:35.200
I've never seen him out of that
costume.

02:35.200 --> 02:36.920
Do you think he could be
a St Bernard?

02:36.920 --> 02:39.120
Well, I was thinking more chipmunk,
but you might be right.

02:39.120 --> 02:42.760
They have got the shittest
gym here I have ever seen.

02:42.760 --> 02:44.960
My ex-wife's got a better
treadmill in her utility room.

02:44.960 --> 02:46.680
Well, admittedly
the facilities are a little tired,

02:46.680 --> 02:50.000
but if United win promotion today,
that's all gonna change.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.600
That's a big if.
At the San Siro,

02:51.600 --> 02:54.440
they had a treadmill in the
officials' changing room,
and someone came round

02:54.440 --> 02:57.400
every 20 minutes and replenished
the towels. It's the little touches.

02:57.400 --> 02:58.680
Where's Oggy?

02:58.680 --> 03:00.240
Where'd you expect him to
be?

03:00.240 --> 03:01.760
Stuffing his face at the
vending machine.

03:01.760 --> 03:03.120
SIGHS

03:03.120 --> 03:04.720
We only had lunch two hours ago.

03:04.720 --> 03:06.760
I mean, the captains'll be here
any minute.

03:06.760 --> 03:08.880
We've got to synchronise our
watches, go through the team
sheet...

03:08.880 --> 03:10.520
Shitting Nora!

03:10.520 --> 03:12.320
Oh, sorry, Phil.

03:12.320 --> 03:13.920
That was me. There's no Glade.

03:13.920 --> 03:16.680
Did a rat crawl up your arse
and die?! Pre-match nerves.

03:16.680 --> 03:18.040
You're the fourth official.

03:18.040 --> 03:20.840
What have you got to be nervous
about? Holding up the wrong numbers
on the board?

03:20.840 --> 03:22.600
Yeah, you may joke,
but that has happened.

03:22.600 --> 03:25.360
Barry Crop once accidentally
signalled for 56 minutes'

03:25.360 --> 03:28.440
added time at a Sheffield derby
game. And it was on Sky.

03:28.440 --> 03:30.600
Took him a good few months
to live that down, I tell you.

03:30.600 --> 03:32.680
At the San Siro...  All right,
Brendan, give it a rest,

03:32.680 --> 03:34.280
for fuck's sake!

03:36.880 --> 03:38.400
Sorry.

03:39.480 --> 03:43.000
I'll just, er, go and squirt a few
drops of Aramis in the pan.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.160
See if it'll help, er,
dissimilate the odour.

03:51.080 --> 03:52.480
DOOR CLOSES

03:53.840 --> 03:55.840
You shouldn't speak to
Brendan like that.

03:55.840 --> 03:58.400
I heard he's being considered
for the select group next
season,

03:58.400 --> 03:59.760
so you could be working under him.

03:59.760 --> 04:02.760
Is that how you see the assistants?
Under the referee?

04:02.760 --> 04:04.960
I thought we were a team?
We are a team,

04:04.960 --> 04:07.480
and that includes the fourth
official.

04:07.480 --> 04:10.320
If we don't respect ourselves,
how are we gonna get respect
from the players?

04:10.320 --> 04:12.480
He's so boring, though,
Martin!

04:12.480 --> 04:13.760
He is boring, yes.

04:13.760 --> 04:15.840
And that's a very good quality
in a referee.

04:15.840 --> 04:18.160
He's anonymously
competent, and that...

04:18.160 --> 04:20.240
..takes guts.
Brendan hasn't got any guts.

04:20.240 --> 04:21.840
He's dropped them all in there!

04:23.280 --> 04:26.760
Right, well, I think that's, er,
taken the edge off it.

04:28.760 --> 04:31.600
Anyway, if anyone should be
nervous, it's me.

04:31.600 --> 04:34.520
Just seen Howard arrive
with half a dozen Qataris.

04:34.520 --> 04:37.160
They've come to cast their
eye over me for 2022.

04:37.160 --> 04:39.840
Oh, you don't think it's because
it's one of the biggest games
in English football?

04:39.840 --> 04:41.360
Well, yeah, there is that.

04:41.360 --> 04:43.000
But if it goes well for me today,

04:43.000 --> 04:46.280
I could be running the line
at a World Cup, Martin.

04:46.280 --> 04:48.760
Imagine being able to flag
Neymar offside.

04:48.760 --> 04:50.760
We are not the story, Phil.

04:50.760 --> 04:53.400
We are neutral officiators.
Never forget that.

04:53.400 --> 04:56.760
Yeah, whatever. If I'm not back in
20 minutes, phone for the fire
brigade.

04:59.360 --> 05:00.640
Ugh!

05:02.160 --> 05:03.680
He has got a lot to learn,
that one.

05:07.360 --> 05:09.040
Are those City pants, Brendan?

05:09.040 --> 05:10.200
No!

05:10.200 --> 05:11.600
Clean on this morning.

05:12.560 --> 05:15.400
Oh, City. Yes, well we're away
at Preston today.

05:15.400 --> 05:17.360
Should be good for a point at
least, don't you think?

05:17.360 --> 05:18.640
Consolidate a play-off place.

05:18.640 --> 05:20.680
You know my thoughts about team
colours in the changing room.

05:20.680 --> 05:23.320
Yes, but it's the last day of the
season. What with us
being City fans...?

05:23.320 --> 05:24.920
Take them off, please.

05:24.920 --> 05:26.440
Of course.

05:26.440 --> 05:27.880
Sorry, Martin.

05:32.080 --> 05:34.200
It's been a good season for
us, but, er...

05:35.280 --> 05:37.800
..without the investment, you know,
you can't really compete.

05:38.800 --> 05:41.800
Still, if we win today,
we might finish third.

05:41.800 --> 05:44.920
We've always been the
bridesmaid, never the bride.

05:44.920 --> 05:46.360
True.

05:46.360 --> 05:48.800
Without that cash we'll never be up
there playing with the big boys.

05:48.800 --> 05:51.880
Oh, if I had a pound for every time
I'd heard you say that, Brendan.

05:51.880 --> 05:53.840
You all right, boss?
How you feeling?

05:53.840 --> 05:56.080
Hey, it's filling up
out there, you know.

05:56.080 --> 05:58.280
You can cut the atmosphere
with a cake slice.

05:58.280 --> 05:59.320
Sorry.

05:59.320 --> 06:01.080
Have you warmed up, Oggy? Yeah.

06:01.080 --> 06:03.800
I did hot yoga in the bath
this morning. I am serious.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.520
Don't worry, boss.

06:05.520 --> 06:06.640
I'll do me stretches.

06:06.640 --> 06:08.080
Where's Phil, anyway?

06:08.080 --> 06:10.120
Doesn't he normally lead
the ref-aerobics around now?

06:10.120 --> 06:12.240
He's shaving.
Yeah, I bet he is.

06:12.240 --> 06:13.320
Bloody Sky's here.

06:13.320 --> 06:15.640
He'll be doing a back, sack
and crack wax, knowing him.

06:15.640 --> 06:18.680
Hey, 20 quid he gels all his
hair up like Gareth Gates.

06:18.680 --> 06:22.040
No betting, Oggy!
You've been warned before.

06:22.040 --> 06:24.320
Only joking! Christ, Martin!

06:24.320 --> 06:26.080
Well, it's not a joking matter,
is it?

06:26.080 --> 06:29.720
What's up with you? This is meant
to be your retirement.

06:29.720 --> 06:30.960
Biggest game of your career.

06:30.960 --> 06:33.000
You should be relishing it.
I am relishing it.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.320
Well, tell your face. It's longer
than one of Brendan's stories.

06:35.320 --> 06:37.080
No offence.
None taken.

06:37.080 --> 06:39.400
We don't all enjoy ourselves
in the same way, Oggy.

06:39.400 --> 06:40.480
All right.

06:41.440 --> 06:44.520
So, goalie for United,
number 1, Charlie Evans.

06:44.520 --> 06:46.080
That's nice and easy.

06:46.080 --> 06:49.120
Back four - Ripley, Price,
Clyne and Cox.

06:49.120 --> 06:51.640
They're your solicitors,
aren't they, Brendan?

06:52.720 --> 06:55.520
Er, midfield is that Polish one
whose name I can never pronounce.

06:55.520 --> 06:57.560
Dzierzanowska.
That's him.

06:57.560 --> 06:59.320
Looks like two bad hands
at Scrabble.

06:59.320 --> 07:01.600
And up front, Calvin Cooke!

07:01.600 --> 07:03.120
I hope you've got his number,
boss.

07:04.760 --> 07:05.800
How d'you mean?

07:06.800 --> 07:08.040
Well, he's got a temper on
him.

07:08.040 --> 07:10.600
A lot of inner demons,
from what I've heard.

07:11.720 --> 07:14.320
Well, he'll be here in a
minute, so you can find out

07:14.320 --> 07:15.800
for yourself, can't you?

07:15.800 --> 07:17.440
Right, can we synchronise
watches, please?

07:17.440 --> 07:18.720
Oh, we don't have to do that.

07:18.720 --> 07:20.320
It's not Mission: Impossible.

07:20.320 --> 07:24.240
I've got 14:02 and 52 seconds.

07:24.240 --> 07:26.120
Er, six minutes past two...

07:26.120 --> 07:29.720
And let's synchronise, please.
56 seconds, 57...

07:29.720 --> 07:31.320
BEEPING
Hang on, hang on.

07:31.320 --> 07:32.920
I can only put this one
forwards, it won't go back.

07:32.920 --> 07:35.760
Oh, for God's sake!
It's three o'clock kick-off,

07:35.760 --> 07:37.360
quarter to four for a pie
and a piss,

07:37.360 --> 07:39.560
ten to five, final score
and get first round in.

07:39.560 --> 07:40.600
It's not rocket science.

07:40.600 --> 07:43.920
Fuckin' lukewarm water and
the shampoo's like dog spunk.

07:43.920 --> 07:45.480
Why hasn't this club
got any money?

07:45.480 --> 07:47.280
Hey! They're like a old bra -

07:47.280 --> 07:49.640
no cups and crap support.
I thank you!

07:49.640 --> 07:51.800
They had Aveda products
throughout at the San Siro.

07:51.800 --> 07:53.400
It's like a boutique hotel.

07:53.400 --> 07:56.360
Do we know if Sky are showing
this in 4K or just in HD?

07:56.360 --> 07:58.240
I don't know. can we just...
Ah, there you go!

07:58.240 --> 07:59.720
What did I tell you? 20 quid.

07:59.720 --> 08:01.840
Worried about your bald spot,
Phil? Fuck off, Oggy!

08:01.840 --> 08:03.320
ANGRILY: Can we
synchronise watches, please?

08:03.320 --> 08:04.920
Hey, I saw you on the
treadmill earlier

08:04.920 --> 08:06.600
practising your backwards
running.

08:06.600 --> 08:09.200
Bullshit.
It's true!

08:09.200 --> 08:12.120
He practises running backwards doing
his Collina face so he can get

08:12.120 --> 08:13.360
a nice big close-up on TV.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.440
No, it's so I can get better
peripheral vision.

08:15.440 --> 08:18.360
It's better than you chugging up and
down like Mr fuckin' Creosote.

08:18.360 --> 08:20.640
Oh, is that right? Mr
Creosote? Guys, please!

08:23.280 --> 08:27.920
If United win today, they get
automatic promotion
to the Premier League.

08:27.920 --> 08:30.520
With merit payments and TV
rights, that's a huge windfall.

08:30.520 --> 08:32.960
150 million, according to
The Mirror. Exactly.

08:32.960 --> 08:34.320
And if Rovers win, they avoid

08:34.320 --> 08:37.120
relegation into the lower leagues
and financial oblivion.

08:37.120 --> 08:41.000
So it's up to us to work as a
team to ensure a fair result.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.200
You know, it's going to be
tense enough out there

08:43.200 --> 08:45.680
without you two glaring at
each other across the pitch

08:45.680 --> 08:47.360
like Bette Davis and Joan
Crawford.

08:48.440 --> 08:49.480
He started it.

08:49.480 --> 08:51.280
MOCKINGLY: "He started
it." I don't care!

08:52.480 --> 08:56.800
We have to be beyond reproach
in every decision we make.

08:58.040 --> 09:00.360
So show some professionalism.
KNOCK ON DOOR

09:02.080 --> 09:03.320
Ah, Calvin, come in.

09:03.320 --> 09:04.920
Is Nico with you?

09:04.920 --> 09:06.560
Haven't seen him. Ah, Oggy,
go and get Nico, will you?

09:06.560 --> 09:09.960
Tell him he's already three
minutes late for
the captains' meeting.

09:09.960 --> 09:13.760
And you, go and do your
manscaping, or whatever it is
you do in there.

09:14.880 --> 09:16.800
You, check the match ball.

09:16.800 --> 09:19.000
I want it 12.5 psi.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.160
Yes, Ref. Sorry.

09:24.120 --> 09:25.200
What's this?

09:25.200 --> 09:26.440
Retirement card.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.120
What, from you
or the whole team?

09:28.120 --> 09:29.320
What do you think?

09:29.320 --> 09:31.680
Hardly going to be walking around
with my own card for you, am I?

09:31.680 --> 09:33.160
So, big game.

09:33.160 --> 09:34.280
Yeah. Yeah.

09:34.280 --> 09:35.680
How you feeling?

09:35.680 --> 09:36.960
I'm OK.

09:36.960 --> 09:38.040
Can I kiss you?

09:42.760 --> 09:45.240
What happened to your rules?

09:45.240 --> 09:46.920
Please.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.400
It's a big game for me as well,
you know.

10:01.840 --> 10:04.040
So now...
..you've just gotta give us

10:04.040 --> 10:05.760
a couple of penalties, right?
CHUCKLES

10:05.760 --> 10:07.440
I'd love it if I could. But I can't.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.920
Not even if there's tugging in
the box? Don't even joke about it.

10:09.920 --> 10:12.960
If the PGMOL ever found out...
You're retiring!

10:12.960 --> 10:14.360
Yeah, but it's my reputation,
isn't it?

10:14.360 --> 10:16.080
Not to mention the legal
consequences.

10:16.080 --> 10:17.840
I mean not just for me,
but for the club!

10:17.840 --> 10:19.920
Martin, nobody's gonna find out.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.200
Relax.

10:22.600 --> 10:24.120
Eh? I've got your back.

10:27.560 --> 10:28.840
I love you.

10:30.480 --> 10:31.760
DOOR OPENS

10:31.760 --> 10:34.560
Ah, Nico, nice of you
to join us.

10:34.560 --> 10:36.920
Right, now, I want a good
clean game

10:36.920 --> 10:39.280
with plenty of flow and all the
focus on the football.

10:39.280 --> 10:41.960
Everybody on that pitch
knows the laws of the game.

10:41.960 --> 10:44.600
And if we stick to that, there's no
reason we can't have a fitting,

10:44.600 --> 10:47.080
dignified, trouble-free end
to the season.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.960
Understand?
WHISTLE BLOWS

10:56.840 --> 10:58.520
WHISTLE BLOWS

10:59.760 --> 11:02.400
CROWD: The referee's a wanker!
The referee's a wanker!

11:02.400 --> 11:04.240
OGGY: Get him under
control, you flaming animal!

11:04.240 --> 11:05.640
Oggy!
He chucked a bap at me!

11:05.640 --> 11:07.720
A what?
A bap! A bacon bap!

11:07.720 --> 11:09.800
Who did? That Polish one.
Dirty bastard.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.520
Dzierzanowska?
Yeah, that's him.

11:11.520 --> 11:13.600
Flaming animal! I want his
name in the book.

11:13.600 --> 11:15.440
If you can frigging spell it..
You're bleeding.

11:15.440 --> 11:17.360
Eh? No, it's just ketchup.

11:17.360 --> 11:19.040
Ah... What should I put
in the report, Martin?

11:19.040 --> 11:22.160
Just put, "Food thrown in tunnel."
We'll see what the damage is later.

11:22.160 --> 11:25.280
At the San Siro, the ushers
escorted you all the way
down the tunnel.

11:25.280 --> 11:26.800
And we had our own
espresso machine.

11:26.800 --> 11:29.280
This was before they became
commonplace. They're more
ubiquitous than kettles now.

11:29.280 --> 11:31.200
Where's Phil?
Oh, he got collared by Mitch.

11:31.200 --> 11:33.040
He was trying to show him
video replay on his phone.

11:33.040 --> 11:35.120
Well, he shouldn't be
looking at that! I know,

11:35.120 --> 11:36.600
but Phil is a pro. I'm sure he can
handle himself.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.760
Did you notice how he went
and picked up the match ball

11:38.760 --> 11:40.160
soon as you blew the whistle?

11:40.160 --> 11:41.560
The he just stood there
with his chin up

11:41.560 --> 11:43.160
waiting for the Steadicam guy
to circle round him?

11:43.160 --> 11:44.680
Oggy's right. That's not
protocol.

11:44.680 --> 11:46.600
He wears eyeliner, you know.
No, he doesn't.

11:46.600 --> 11:48.000
Yes, he does!

11:48.000 --> 11:49.120
Did you not see him when
they had

11:49.120 --> 11:50.960
that minute's silence
for Butch Wilkins last year?

11:50.960 --> 11:52.640
It was running all down
his face!

11:52.640 --> 11:54.320
Linesman Minnelli, they
called him.

11:56.840 --> 11:58.240
It was a goal, wasn't it?

11:58.240 --> 11:59.360
It was a clear goal.

11:59.360 --> 12:01.400
There wasn't a hint of offside?
Not a chance.

12:01.400 --> 12:03.800
I think what they were
contesting was the throw-in.

12:03.800 --> 12:06.080
Don't look at me.
I was six foot away.

12:06.080 --> 12:08.600
That was a throw-in all day,
every day.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.720
Did you see it?
No, I was on the far side.

12:10.720 --> 12:12.840
And you're sure
it was a throw-in?

12:12.840 --> 12:15.200
May God strike me down.

12:15.200 --> 12:17.000
It was 18 inches off the line.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.640
What, in or out?
In!

12:18.640 --> 12:20.360
I've just seen the replay.
Shit!

12:20.360 --> 12:23.000
Nah, that's impossible. I saw it
cross with my own eyes.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.520
You should have gone to
Specsavers, then,
shouldn't you?

12:24.520 --> 12:25.680
Calvin wanted to talk to you

12:25.680 --> 12:27.080
but I told him he'd have to
wait until after the game.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.480
Yeah, well, quite right. It's only
half-time, for goodness' sake.

12:29.480 --> 12:30.560
Anything could happen yet!

12:30.560 --> 12:32.600
What did he say?
He's fuming!

12:32.600 --> 12:36.200
Mitch the fuckin' Meerkat
keeps on showing everyone
the footage on his phone.

12:36.200 --> 12:37.800
What do you mean, meerkat?
He's an otter!

12:37.800 --> 12:39.520
How can he be an otter?!

12:39.520 --> 12:41.080
Otters are mustelids with tiny
ears.

12:41.080 --> 12:42.760
All right, David
fucking Attenborough!

12:42.760 --> 12:45.200
I always thought he was a tadpole,
but it never sat right with me.

12:45.200 --> 12:46.240
It'll blow over.

12:46.240 --> 12:47.760
Oh, yes. I don't even think
Mitch knows what he is.

12:47.760 --> 12:48.840
No, I mean the throw-in!

12:48.840 --> 12:51.040
It's just one of those
decisions, isn't it?

12:51.040 --> 12:52.640
You know, some go for you,
some go against you.

12:52.640 --> 12:54.960
During the season, they just
even themselves out.

12:56.160 --> 12:57.760
No, I don't...
I don't think they do.

13:00.440 --> 13:03.160
What time was the goal?
Er...

13:03.160 --> 13:05.080
..27 minutes.

13:05.080 --> 13:07.320
Which means the throw-in
was at 26 minutes, right?

13:07.320 --> 13:09.960
Well, I don't know. I don't time
every throw-in, do I?

13:09.960 --> 13:11.800
Well, somebody does!

13:11.800 --> 13:13.880
Don't they, Oggy?

13:13.880 --> 13:15.720
What are you on about?

13:17.240 --> 13:18.800
Martin, can I have a word?

13:18.800 --> 13:21.560
No, no, if you've got something
to say, let's say it here.

13:21.560 --> 13:23.160
All right.

13:23.160 --> 13:24.880
In-play betting.

13:24.880 --> 13:26.880
Every corner, every goal,

13:26.880 --> 13:28.680
every free kick - you can bet
on anything these days.

13:28.680 --> 13:30.000
I know what in-play betting is!

13:30.000 --> 13:33.400
Right, so if a betting syndicate
from the Far East, say,

13:33.400 --> 13:36.600
could guarantee exactly what time
a throw-in would be awarded to

13:36.600 --> 13:38.520
a certain team, well...

13:39.560 --> 13:41.760
..a small fortune could be made.

13:45.280 --> 13:47.200
Are you making an allegation here?

13:47.200 --> 13:48.400
He's talking out of his arse.

13:48.400 --> 13:50.080
It happens all the time in Italy.
In the San Siro...

13:50.080 --> 13:52.960
Oh, will you stop going on
about the shitting San Siro!

13:52.960 --> 13:56.680
You were a backup referee at
an under-14s friendly in 1992!

13:56.680 --> 13:57.800
Under 17s.

13:57.800 --> 14:01.560
You didn't even get on the pitch!
Envy eats nothing but its own heart.

14:01.560 --> 14:03.800
What?! How come you know
so much about it?

14:05.960 --> 14:08.080
Because I was approached
to take the same bung.

14:10.120 --> 14:14.240
15K if I awarded Rovers a throw-in
at exactly 26 minutes.

14:14.240 --> 14:15.760
Easy money, the guy said.

14:17.560 --> 14:19.600
But I told him no way.

14:19.600 --> 14:22.040
Well...that's just
a coincidence.

14:23.720 --> 14:25.360
Big fucking coincidence.
You see - 

14:25.360 --> 14:28.120
this is why we need VAR as
standard. Then we wouldn't
be in this pickle.

14:28.120 --> 14:29.520
Not now, Brendan.

14:31.840 --> 14:34.720
Did you take that money, Oggy?

14:35.880 --> 14:37.720
I need you to tell me
the truth now.

14:40.320 --> 14:43.280
Now, I can call the police in
here, we can have this game
abandoned.

14:48.280 --> 14:49.360
It was only a throw-in!

14:50.680 --> 14:52.360
I didn't think it would matter
that much either way.

14:52.360 --> 14:55.440
Oh, my giddy aunt,
I am not hearing this!

14:55.440 --> 14:57.400
I didn't know they were gonna
go and score off the back of
it, did I?

14:57.400 --> 14:58.800
It was a foot and a half in!

14:58.800 --> 15:00.040
I panicked!

15:00.040 --> 15:02.640
They said if I didn't comply,
something bad would happen to me.

15:02.640 --> 15:04.240
What, they'd unplug the
vending machines?

15:04.240 --> 15:07.560
Martin, please.
It's your last-ever game.

15:07.560 --> 15:09.080
I'll split the money with you.

15:09.080 --> 15:11.280
I-I-I'll give it to charity.

15:11.280 --> 15:12.840
Just don't dob me in it,
please!

15:12.840 --> 15:14.000
Just let me think, will you?

15:14.000 --> 15:16.120
Why did you do it, Oggy?

15:17.240 --> 15:20.040
We get treated like shit
week in, week out.

15:20.040 --> 15:22.760
Spat at by so-called fans,

15:22.760 --> 15:24.480
abused by players, managers,

15:24.480 --> 15:26.440
then the pundits weigh in
and...

15:27.680 --> 15:30.600
..suddenly your kids
are getting bullied at school.

15:30.600 --> 15:32.840
That's no excuse, Oggy.

15:32.840 --> 15:34.040
DOOR OPENS

15:34.040 --> 15:35.880
What the fuck is going on
with you lot today?

15:35.880 --> 15:38.400
Have you seen this footage?
Calvin, you cannot be in here!

15:38.400 --> 15:42.000
There's no way that that's over
the line. Look. Look!

15:42.000 --> 15:43.720
We're not permitted to see that
footage until after the game.

15:43.720 --> 15:46.320
Are you kidding me, Martin?
Are you fucking

15:46.320 --> 15:47.800
kidding me?!
Please, Calvin.

15:47.800 --> 15:50.160
MITCH: Where is he? Where
is he?!

15:52.480 --> 15:54.640
I'll rip his fucking head off!

15:54.640 --> 15:55.800
Mitchell, out! Linesman?!

15:55.800 --> 15:57.960
Call yourself a linesman?
Have you seen that?

15:57.960 --> 15:59.440
You could drive a fuckin' bus
through that gap!

15:59.440 --> 16:00.920
Martin, you have to say
something! Come on, man!

16:00.920 --> 16:02.320
At least send him out there
to apologise.

16:02.320 --> 16:04.880
Oh, what, so I can have food
thrown in me face again?

16:04.880 --> 16:06.200
Oh, you'd enjoy that, wouldn't
you?

16:06.200 --> 16:07.560
You'd eat it, you fat git!

16:07.560 --> 16:09.520
Say that again, you...

16:09.520 --> 16:12.360
ALL YELLING
Say it to my face!

16:12.360 --> 16:14.080
Go on, say it again!

16:14.080 --> 16:16.000
Go on!

16:16.000 --> 16:18.840
THUMP
WHISTLE BLOWS

16:22.240 --> 16:23.440
What are you doing?

16:24.720 --> 16:28.000
You're off!
You're out the game!

16:28.000 --> 16:29.080
You can't do that!

16:29.080 --> 16:31.360
You can't do that.
He can't do that, it's half-time!

16:31.360 --> 16:33.480
Course he can.
Brendan, tell him!

16:33.480 --> 16:36.760
Law 12. The referee
has the authority to
take disciplinary action

16:36.760 --> 16:39.160
from entering the field of play
for the pre-match inspection

16:39.160 --> 16:41.160
until leaving the field of play
at the end of the match.

16:41.160 --> 16:43.000
This is a conspiracy!

16:43.000 --> 16:46.280
You should be whipped, the
lot of you! Martin, you can't.

16:47.320 --> 16:49.880
If I meant to show him the yellow
card, I can change my mind, can't I?

16:49.880 --> 16:52.480
You've already booked him once,
Martin, it's a dismissal either way.

16:52.480 --> 16:54.320
I want him red-carded -
violent conduct!

16:54.320 --> 16:57.040
Yeah? Well, it's nothing to do
with you, is it, knobhead?!

16:57.040 --> 16:58.320
Get him out of here!

17:00.880 --> 17:02.160
Get my head!

17:10.560 --> 17:11.920
Martin, you can't...

17:13.560 --> 17:15.680
Not in this match, not today.
Please!

17:15.680 --> 17:17.480
Well, I'm sorry, Calvin.
It's the laws of the game.

17:17.480 --> 17:19.440
So, you know,
it's a straight red.

17:19.440 --> 17:21.360
A straight red?

17:21.360 --> 17:22.600
Mm-hm.

17:24.680 --> 17:27.000
Well, that's the only straight
thing about you, then, isn't it?

17:31.640 --> 17:34.640
You've sucked my cock for the last
time, Martin, do you understand?

17:34.640 --> 17:36.000
You're pathetic.

17:37.480 --> 17:39.520
Don't call me again!

17:46.320 --> 17:47.600
DOOR SLAMS

17:51.080 --> 17:55.600
CROWD CHANTING: The referee's a
wanker! The referee's a wanker!

17:55.600 --> 18:00.400
The referee's a wanker!
The referee's a wanker!

18:00.400 --> 18:03.720
The referee's a wanker!

18:03.720 --> 18:07.560
The referee's a wanker!
The referee's a wanker!

18:07.560 --> 18:09.720
The referee's a wanker!

18:09.720 --> 18:11.840
I'll put all that
in the report, or...?

18:16.520 --> 18:19.680
Just put Number 9, Cooke,
dismissed for violent conduct.

18:25.760 --> 18:27.840
Martin...
Don't.

18:29.280 --> 18:31.360
Just don't.

18:35.160 --> 18:39.120
What are we going to do
about... the other thing?

18:43.200 --> 18:46.080
Did you report that approach
to the FA, Phil?

18:46.080 --> 18:47.520
Course not.

18:47.520 --> 18:49.760
I was scared of ruining my
chances for the World Cup.

18:49.760 --> 18:51.640
Right, then, in that case
we just...

18:51.640 --> 18:52.880
..make things even.

18:54.920 --> 18:56.360
Oh, Martin, I don't think...

18:56.360 --> 19:00.000
If the opportunity comes to give
United a goal, I'm going to take it,

19:00.000 --> 19:02.200
be it an offside or a penalty
or whatever,

19:02.200 --> 19:05.360
and I want you lot to back me
up. Do you understand?

19:05.360 --> 19:07.640
It's just about being fair
and proper.

19:07.640 --> 19:10.600
Sorry, but how is that fair
and proper?

19:10.600 --> 19:12.320
If he hadn't awarded that
throw-in to Rovers,

19:12.320 --> 19:14.160
they wouldn't have scored and it
would have been 0-0,
wouldn't it?

19:14.160 --> 19:16.000
So we're just evening things
up.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Whoever wins after that,
well, good luck to them.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.560
This is...highly irregular,
Martin.

19:21.560 --> 19:23.000
Are you're sure that...

19:23.000 --> 19:25.400
..your judgment hasn't been
coloured by...

19:25.400 --> 19:26.800
..you know?

19:29.120 --> 19:30.280
By what?

19:32.200 --> 19:33.800
Calvin.

19:33.800 --> 19:35.120
The fact you just suc...

19:35.120 --> 19:36.400
Sent him off.

19:37.840 --> 19:39.800
I've done nothing wrong.

19:41.880 --> 19:44.520
My whole career has been
above board and by the book.

19:44.520 --> 19:46.920
Yet you're about to gift a goal
to United.

19:46.920 --> 19:48.520
My conscience is clear.

19:50.040 --> 19:53.120
Now, if any of you want to report
what's happened and go to the FA,

19:53.120 --> 19:55.400
then say so now

19:55.400 --> 19:57.600
and we'll stop this game.

19:57.600 --> 19:59.120
Hm? Well?

20:04.440 --> 20:07.040
We'd better get back out
there.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.640
The crowd are going to give
you some stick, Martin.

20:08.640 --> 20:10.680
Oh, that's nothing I can't
handle.

20:10.680 --> 20:14.360
Gentlemen, let's get out there

20:14.360 --> 20:16.600
and restore some sanity.

20:24.640 --> 20:27.360
CROWD BOOING

20:31.960 --> 20:34.600
FINAL WHISTLE

20:34.600 --> 20:37.920
CROWD YELLING

20:39.480 --> 20:42.480
RADIO PRESENTER:
There's all sorts of reports
coming out of Wallis Park

20:42.480 --> 20:45.480
at the moment, where the match
between United and Rovers

20:45.480 --> 20:47.440
was abandoned 12 minutes
from time.

20:47.440 --> 20:49.680
Let's go to our reporter there,
Eamonn Travers.

20:49.680 --> 20:51.760
Eamonn, is the picture
any clearer yet?

20:51.760 --> 20:54.760
No, John. As you say, rumours
spreading here like wildfire.

20:54.760 --> 20:56.920
There have been allegations
of match-fixing,

20:56.920 --> 20:59.520
collusion with the officials,
and even, shall we say,

20:59.520 --> 21:02.720
a personal relationship between
a key player for United

21:02.720 --> 21:04.840
and the referee
Martin Rutherford.

21:04.840 --> 21:07.720
The trouble started, well,
it started in the first half

21:07.720 --> 21:09.840
with that controversial goal
for Rovers

21:09.840 --> 21:13.400
and the mysterious dismissal
at half-time of the United
captain Calvin Cooke,

21:13.400 --> 21:16.280
but it was compounded by an
extraordinary second half

21:16.280 --> 21:19.600
which saw Rutherford award a frankly
ludicrous penalty to United,

21:19.600 --> 21:22.000
which was missed,
and ordered to be retaken,

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
not once, not twice,
but three times

21:25.000 --> 21:26.800
until Kirby scored to level
the game.

21:26.800 --> 21:29.960
This led to a mass brawl on
the pitch, five red cards...

21:32.240 --> 21:35.080
The press are going to have
an absolute field day with this.

21:35.080 --> 21:37.400
Are you kidding?
They already are.

21:37.400 --> 21:40.360
Robbie Savage has just been
on, tearing us to shreds.

21:40.360 --> 21:43.600
He even had a go at my hair, which
is the pot calling the kettle black.

21:44.760 --> 21:46.280
How's Martin?

21:46.280 --> 21:48.080
He's shaken but philosophical.

21:48.080 --> 21:50.560
I think he's aware his legacy
is somewhat tarnished.

21:50.560 --> 21:54.920
Somewhat? He's the Lance
Armstrong of football referees.

21:54.920 --> 21:56.240
He's fucked himself.

21:56.240 --> 21:58.240
Not...anatomically.

21:58.240 --> 22:00.920
Or professionally, as long
as we all stick together.

22:00.920 --> 22:03.560
He can't be blamed for them
players fighting like that.

22:03.560 --> 22:06.840
Brendan, he gave a penalty
for a handball

22:06.840 --> 22:08.040
against the goalkeeper!

22:08.040 --> 22:10.720
Well, he didn't know it
was the keeper, did he?

22:10.720 --> 22:13.120
What, the one in the big
bright red shirt with gloves on

22:13.120 --> 22:15.000
leaping through the air like
Superman?

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
I think even Arsene Wenger
might have spotted that one.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.040
He was trying to even things
up.

22:19.040 --> 22:20.480
Just cancel out Oggy's mistake.

22:20.480 --> 22:22.280
We are going to stand by him,
aren't we?

22:22.280 --> 22:23.960
Well...like I say.

22:25.080 --> 22:26.600
He's fucked himself.

22:31.800 --> 22:33.480
They want to speak to you
next, Phil.

22:35.240 --> 22:37.200
Is Howard there?
Yeah.

22:37.200 --> 22:38.960
And the police.

22:40.640 --> 22:42.400
It's a criminal matter now,
apparently.

22:43.680 --> 22:45.120
Christ.

22:46.680 --> 22:48.600
Are the Qataris still here?

22:48.600 --> 22:51.000
You mean the Arabs?
I didn't see any.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.560
Fuck's sake!

22:53.920 --> 22:56.000
If this costs me my World Cup
spot...

22:57.080 --> 22:59.080
I've always liked you, Phil.

22:59.080 --> 23:00.440
You know that, don't you?

23:01.520 --> 23:04.120
Not in a Martin and Calvin
kind of way,

23:04.120 --> 23:06.080
more like professional....

23:06.080 --> 23:08.120
..respect.

23:08.120 --> 23:10.280
You won't dob me in it,
will you?

23:11.560 --> 23:13.320
Please.

23:21.720 --> 23:23.600
He's going to tell them
everything, isn't he?

23:23.600 --> 23:25.160
Course he is.

23:25.160 --> 23:28.400
He'll sing like a canary on The X
Factor to save his own skin.

23:28.400 --> 23:30.880
You'd better get yourself
a solicitor, pal.

23:32.040 --> 23:35.320
Whatever happened to
"What happens in the ref's
room stays in the ref's room"?

23:35.320 --> 23:36.800
Nah, different game now.

23:36.800 --> 23:38.880
You know when the rot set in?

23:38.880 --> 23:41.600
When they started putting
us in coloured jerseys.

23:41.600 --> 23:42.720
Ugh!

23:42.720 --> 23:45.000
Back in the day
you were the Man in Black.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.520
Big characters like George
Courtney. Keith Hackett.

23:48.520 --> 23:50.200
Yes. Men to be feared.

23:50.200 --> 23:54.240
Then the television money came in
and they demanded more colour.

23:54.240 --> 23:56.480
Pinks, greens, burgundies.

23:56.480 --> 24:00.440
We look more like Showaddywaddy
than football referees.

24:00.440 --> 24:02.680
Sports entertainment.

24:02.680 --> 24:05.480
No, it's all about the money
now.

24:05.480 --> 24:07.280
As you well know, Oggy.

24:07.280 --> 24:10.000
And that 15 grand won't take
you very far through the courts.

24:11.280 --> 24:14.680
I don't even think it was
an eastern betting syndicate.

24:14.680 --> 24:17.600
I think it was just one man
putting a voice on.

24:18.840 --> 24:22.840
Now I think of it, he
sounded more like Benny Hill
doing Mr Chow Mein.

24:24.280 --> 24:26.960
All right, boss? How's your
eye? Looks painful.

24:26.960 --> 24:28.280
Yeah, stings a bit, you know.

24:29.880 --> 24:31.400
Where's Phil?

24:31.400 --> 24:34.120
Oh, he's... He's giving his
statement to...

24:34.120 --> 24:36.000
..to Howard and the police.

24:37.520 --> 24:39.680
Well, bang goes my pension,
then, eh?

24:39.680 --> 24:41.480
I don't think they can, er,

24:41.480 --> 24:44.160
hold you entirely responsible,
Martin.

24:44.160 --> 24:45.920
You did it in the spirit
of fairness.

24:45.920 --> 24:47.320
No, I did it...

24:48.920 --> 24:50.120
I did it for love.

24:52.840 --> 24:54.200
Has Calvin been around?

24:54.200 --> 24:56.640
No. I believe his agent
whisked him away.

24:56.640 --> 24:58.240
He'll be wanting to get his
side of the story

24:58.240 --> 25:00.800
in the Sunday papers
before all the rumours start.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.080
Yeah, of course...

25:03.240 --> 25:04.280
He's a good lad.

25:07.640 --> 25:11.080
If there's any way of keeping
my name out of it,
I'd appreciate it, boss.

25:11.080 --> 25:12.520
Oh, yeah, of course.

25:12.520 --> 25:14.480
Well, I'll do what I can.

25:16.160 --> 25:17.400
Thanks.

25:19.800 --> 25:21.720
Hey, er, give my love
to the San Siro.

25:21.720 --> 25:23.000
Heh!

25:23.000 --> 25:25.600
In bocca al lupo.
CHUCKLES

25:25.600 --> 25:26.920
Good luck.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.160
KNOCK AT DOOR

26:01.160 --> 26:02.600
Come in.

26:04.960 --> 26:06.080
Hi.

26:07.880 --> 26:10.040
I just want to apologise
about earlier, you know.

26:10.040 --> 26:12.520
Things were said
in the heat of the moment.

26:12.520 --> 26:15.240
There's no hard feelings,
Mitch, eh? I understand.

26:15.240 --> 26:17.640
Get carried away, we do,
don't we, eh?

26:17.640 --> 26:20.440
About 22 blokes chasing a
pig's bladder around a field.

26:20.440 --> 26:23.520
Well, the game's nothing without
passion and we should never
apologise for that.

26:23.520 --> 26:24.560
Thanks. Er...

26:24.560 --> 26:26.800
Anyway, look,
I just wanted to let you know

26:26.800 --> 26:29.400
that the place is crawling
with press out there

26:29.400 --> 26:31.240
and they all want to talk
to you.

26:31.240 --> 26:33.880
They're saying all sorts of
nonsense about you and young Calvin.

26:33.880 --> 26:35.520
I don't believe a word of it,
mind you, now,

26:35.520 --> 26:38.120
but when you leave, you know, you
ought to use the back entrance.

26:38.120 --> 26:39.840
Exit.

26:39.840 --> 26:41.360
That's the one. Not the...

26:41.360 --> 26:42.760
All right.

26:42.760 --> 26:44.200
Oh, er, hey!

26:44.200 --> 26:45.920
You're a City fan, aren't you?

26:45.920 --> 26:49.000
Er, yeah, yeah, for my sins.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.800
Well, if it's any consolation,
you had a good win today,
you know, Preston.

26:51.800 --> 26:54.960
3-1.
Oh, well. Every cloud, eh?

26:54.960 --> 26:56.800
They've also said
they're gonna dock us points,

26:56.800 --> 26:59.120
by the look of things,
because of all the fracas.

26:59.120 --> 27:01.120
Oh, you think so?
Well, you saw it out there.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.640
I mean, it was brutal.

27:02.640 --> 27:04.880
They're already calling it
"The War of Wallis Park".

27:04.880 --> 27:08.200
Gary Lineker, he's been on
Twitter saying that it
would be morally wrong

27:08.200 --> 27:09.720
if we were promoted.

27:09.720 --> 27:11.480
Yeah, but he's into refugees
and all that malarkey.

27:11.480 --> 27:12.760
So he shouldn't be listened
to, really.

27:12.760 --> 27:14.120
He's an interfering do-gooder.

27:14.120 --> 27:16.800
Yeah. Never professionally
booked, though, eh? That
takes some restraint.

27:16.800 --> 27:18.560
You know what that means, though,
don't you? We get docked

27:18.560 --> 27:20.640
and we're gonna go down
to third place.

27:20.640 --> 27:22.160
And that means you lot, City,

27:22.160 --> 27:24.440
you're gonna get promoted
instead of us, you know?

27:24.440 --> 27:26.400
£150 million quid right up
the shitter!

27:26.400 --> 27:27.800
No offence.

27:27.800 --> 27:29.360
Well, that would be something.

27:29.360 --> 27:34.200
Anyway, you know, I just
wanted to say it's been
a real pleasure

27:34.200 --> 27:35.720
to work with you over the years,

27:35.720 --> 27:37.520
and it's a shame it had to end like
this, really, isn't it, you know?

27:37.520 --> 27:39.200
Football, eh?

27:39.200 --> 27:40.680
Bloody hell.

27:40.680 --> 27:41.880
Oh, Mitch, can I ask you a
question?

27:41.880 --> 27:43.720
Yeah. Yeah.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.800
What creature are you?

27:46.800 --> 27:48.160
What, this?

27:48.160 --> 27:49.880
Absolutely no idea.

27:52.280 --> 27:55.160
I know I look a right See You
Next Tuesday in it, but, er...

27:56.880 --> 27:58.640
...you do anything for your
club, don't you?

28:01.520 --> 28:03.840
I suppose you do, yeah.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.760
CROWD ROARS
