00:02.469 --> 00:04.520
Large cappuccino,double shot,

00:04.760 --> 00:07.900
dry,add soy milk,with one sugar.

00:08.350 --> 00:09.840
Thank you.

00:09.970 --> 00:11.680
So,a lotof recoveries today?

00:12.020 --> 00:14.400
A guy in county,early
60s -- marginal.

00:14.580 --> 00:16.059
Yeah,I heard about him.

00:16.170 --> 00:17.660
And a suicidein southern ohio.

00:17.990 --> 00:19.190
Some possiblebronchial issues.

00:19.300 --> 00:20.290
We're just waitingon some test results.

00:20.410 --> 00:22.230
I slept eight hourslast night

00:22.350 --> 00:24.180
for the first timesince
I've been in pittsburgh.

00:25.550 --> 00:27.560
I woke up this morning.I read my paper.

00:27.660 --> 00:28.810
I walked outof my apartment

00:28.920 --> 00:31.040
and felt likeI actually lived here.

00:31.900 --> 00:33.170
That's good.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.410
I want totake you out tonight.

00:38.450 --> 00:39.360
Out?

00:39.480 --> 00:40.400
On a date.

00:41.800 --> 00:42.950
Okay.

00:43.510 --> 00:44.780
Okay.

00:46.070 --> 00:47.310
I'd like that.

00:47.470 --> 00:48.870
That's good.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.350
Should we talkabout your divorce?

00:51.580 --> 00:52.690
No.

00:53.200 --> 00:55.640
I made reservations,so
I'll pick you up at 8:00.

00:58.990 --> 01:01.990
"As we are so wonderfullydone
with each other,

01:02.530 --> 01:05.750
"we can walk into our
separatesleep on floors of music,

01:05.910 --> 01:08.630
where the milk-white
cloakof childhood lies."

01:08.730 --> 01:10.750
Nneth patchen
--n --I love him.

01:10.870 --> 01:11.680
Should I continue?

01:11.790 --> 01:12.880
Please.

01:13.410 --> 01:16.380
"Oh,my love,my golden lark,

01:16.630 --> 01:19.160
my soft,long doll."

01:19.270 --> 01:21.560
"My soft,long doll."

01:22.800 --> 01:24.720
Good morning,miss bishop.

01:25.110 --> 01:27.460
Uh,both miss bishops.

01:27.710 --> 01:28.910
So,what's going on here?

01:29.040 --> 01:31.770
Oh,um,dr. Grant cameand
spoke with them last night

01:31.890 --> 01:33.330
- about movingto hospice care.
- Of couse

01:33.730 --> 01:35.700
- Mary singletary,you have a call on line 1.
- Excuse me.

01:37.760 --> 01:40.570
We're still hoping,but
if we can't turn back --

01:40.690 --> 01:43.060
you know,I haven't
conferredwith dr. Grant yet.

01:43.320 --> 01:47.270
Oh,well,we found a nice
placein shadyside -- a hospice.

01:47.660 --> 01:50.350
I know I'm going to die.

01:55.250 --> 01:58.150
Shadyside --they're
really good there.

02:11.500 --> 02:12.400
Are you okay?

02:12.520 --> 02:13.880
Fine.

02:16.910 --> 02:18.730
Well,it's loosening upa little bit.

02:18.850 --> 02:20.850
I don't know...about that.

02:22.130 --> 02:24.560
Hey,this is an amazing idea,stephen.

02:24.680 --> 02:26.140
You did thisall by yourself?

02:26.260 --> 02:28.170
My friends at
--at school.

02:28.580 --> 02:30.570
Well,you have dreamt up a
wayto make the lungs behave

02:30.680 --> 02:32.760
like they're still in the
bodywhile we transport them.

02:32.890 --> 02:36.030
This is incredible.Really,this
could really work.

02:36.140 --> 02:38.110
They've already figured out
howto transport hearts and kidneys

02:38.230 --> 02:40.410
over long
distances,but lungs --

02:40.530 --> 02:42.250
I mean,this could really work.

02:43.200 --> 02:45.110
- Dr. Grant.
- I'll be with youin a minute.

02:45.280 --> 02:48.270
- The tricky part is keeping the
- dr. Grant.

02:49.660 --> 02:51.370
What is it,mary?

02:54.190 --> 02:55.580
- Dr. Jonas.
- Yeah.

02:55.760 --> 02:56.580
I need you to take care

02:56.680 --> 02:58.760
of all of my patientsand
surgeries today.

02:59.230 --> 03:01.100
I'm transferringall of my calls to you.

03:01.580 --> 03:02.970
My biggest concernis stephen chandler.

03:03.090 --> 03:04.140
Keep a close watch.

03:04.400 --> 03:05.950
Dr. Grant,can we discuss margo bishop?

03:06.070 --> 03:07.420
The short listis on my desk.

03:07.540 --> 03:09.340
Mary can help youdecipher my notes.

03:13.260 --> 03:14.590
Janet,what's going on here?

03:14.730 --> 03:16.230
The paramedicsare working on him.

03:16.350 --> 03:18.110
He signed a dnr. They're
noteven supposed to be here.

03:18.220 --> 03:19.130
Did you call him?

03:19.250 --> 03:20.340
Tripp,bart doesn't want this.

03:20.460 --> 03:22.380
Mom,I want youto pack
up some stuff for dad

03:22.500 --> 03:23.800
and meet usat the hospital.

03:23.920 --> 03:25.430
I'm gonna ride with himin the ambulance.

03:25.560 --> 03:27.380
I'll come to the hospital.We
can figure it out from there.

03:27.460 --> 03:28.490
There nothing*****

03:28.690 --> 03:30.450
This is between my
mother,my father,and myself.

03:30.570 --> 03:32.690
Tripp,he signeda "do not resuscitate."

03:32.800 --> 03:34.380
Nate,this is not your hospital,

03:34.500 --> 03:36.460
and my fatheris not your patient.

03:39.020 --> 03:40.680
This is the last thingbart wants.

03:42.070 --> 03:44.630
Tripp doesn't understandthe
nature of this disease.

03:44.760 --> 03:46.800
Bart is not coming back.

03:46.920 --> 03:50.070
Nate,this is familywe're
talking about now.

04:04.430 --> 04:05.770
Nathaniel's upset.

04:06.510 --> 04:07.840
I did not know what to do

04:08.120 --> 04:10.290
when tripp called the paramedics.

04:10.520 --> 04:13.680
See,tripp has never felt
close enough to bart.

04:13.930 --> 04:15.620
When he got home a few days ago,

04:15.740 --> 04:17.160
bart wasn't lucid.

04:18.140 --> 04:19.570
Tripp just wants bart

04:19.600 --> 04:21.209
to be aware that he's here.

04:21.339 --> 04:23.830
You know,he needs to say his goodbyes.

04:24.530 --> 04:26.990
Oh. Oh,I feel badly.

04:27.860 --> 04:29.460
I just picked up the phone

04:29.580 --> 04:30.770
and called nathaniel.

04:30.890 --> 04:33.340
I didn't even think about it.

04:33.510 --> 04:35.840
It's who bart would want me to call.

04:36.110 --> 04:38.030
And then there's tripp.

04:38.160 --> 04:39.480
What do you want?

04:40.130 --> 04:42.870
I just want to help my son through this.

04:44.410 --> 04:46.250
- Kate.
- Hey,tripp.

04:46.530 --> 04:48.170
So good of you to come.

04:49.620 --> 04:51.060
I'm so sorry about bart.

04:51.170 --> 04:52.460
Are you okay?

04:54.980 --> 04:57.120
Good of you to come.

05:03.300 --> 05:04.990
I'll speak with nathaniel.

05:05.120 --> 05:06.220
Thanks.

05:14.290 --> 05:16.750
All right.Now you feel okay?

05:24.760 --> 05:26.320
That poem that you were
reading to mrs. Bishop

05:26.440 --> 05:27.400
is that hers?

05:27.530 --> 05:28.750
Like hers,but no.

05:28.870 --> 05:29.720
Ah.

05:30.120 --> 05:32.420
It's just one of her favorites.

05:33.620 --> 05:35.530
Listen,I'm worried about the move.

05:35.700 --> 05:38.130
I'm worried that margo's
gonna die in transport.

05:39.830 --> 05:41.060
It's multivisceral surgery.

05:41.190 --> 05:42.250
You've done this before?

05:42.370 --> 05:44.790
The last timewas 22 hours straight.

05:45.090 --> 05:46.210
That's from donor recovery

05:46.330 --> 05:47.790
to the last stitchof an anastomosis.

05:47.940 --> 05:49.150
22 hours?

05:49.270 --> 05:51.090
Organ recovery aloneis five hours.

05:51.210 --> 05:52.730
Then you have to take
outthe recipient's organs

05:52.850 --> 05:54.440
one at a time
--the stomach,

05:54.570 --> 05:58.080
duodenum,spleen,pancreas,intestines,and
liver.

05:58.190 --> 05:59.790
We were 10 hours into it

05:59.920 --> 06:01.940
before we evendid the first transplant.

06:02.610 --> 06:05.410
I knew that thiswas a
giant procedure,but --

06:05.540 --> 06:06.590
people were cryingin there,

06:06.710 --> 06:08.840
and I'm not talking aboutthe
patient or his family.

06:11.370 --> 06:12.090
Hi.

06:12.200 --> 06:13.500
Morning.

06:13.610 --> 06:14.720
Morning.

06:14.880 --> 06:15.920
Morning.

06:16.030 --> 06:19.710
So,uh,how's it usually
workedwith the other fellows?

06:19.830 --> 06:21.000
Their term ends.

06:21.110 --> 06:22.590
They meet with nathanieland bart,

06:22.780 --> 06:24.260
and thenthey usually leave.

06:24.380 --> 06:25.240
They leave?

06:25.520 --> 06:26.870
Yeah,most of the time.

06:27.860 --> 06:30.600
But the good news
is,once you leave here,

06:30.720 --> 06:31.790
everybody wants you.

06:33.380 --> 06:35.060
Yeah,but I don'twant to leave here.

06:35.210 --> 06:36.450
I'm surprisedyou want to stay.

06:36.780 --> 06:38.300
- Why?
- Why?

06:38.770 --> 06:39.860
I don't have tolike it here.

06:39.980 --> 06:41.930
It's about beingat the
best place in the world.

06:42.290 --> 06:43.030
Do you like it here?

06:43.160 --> 06:43.960
It's not about me.

06:44.080 --> 06:45.160
Do you want me to leave?

06:45.290 --> 06:46.460
It doesn't matterwhat I want.

06:46.690 --> 06:47.910
Well,it matters to me.

06:48.040 --> 06:48.760
And mary?

06:48.890 --> 06:50.040
Mary was one night.

06:50.140 --> 06:52.000
We're just friends.We're fine now.

06:52.190 --> 06:53.660
Does mary
feel that --

06:55.240 --> 06:56.950
hi.

06:57.470 --> 06:58.460
Hey.

06:58.600 --> 07:00.970
Hi.

07:03.270 --> 07:05.210
That's what I'm talking about,simon.

07:05.430 --> 07:07.470
I don't want
anotherhospital relationship.

07:07.600 --> 07:09.290
People always get hurt.

07:09.920 --> 07:11.070
I hope you stay,okay,

07:11.190 --> 07:13.540
but there's nothing I can
doabout what they decide.

07:19.050 --> 07:21.080
Dr. Jonas,can I have a minute?

07:21.200 --> 07:21.810
What is it?

07:21.920 --> 07:23.310
Well,my fellowship is upnext week.

07:23.430 --> 07:25.300
And I've been toldthere's only one spot.

07:25.620 --> 07:27.410
So I was hoping we
coulddiscuss the possibility --

07:27.530 --> 07:30.070
vancouver,dr. Grant is off today.

07:30.190 --> 07:32.370
I have to go down,check out the charts,

07:32.490 --> 07:35.610
and go over dr. Grant'sshort list.

07:39.980 --> 07:41.360
Okay,stephen chandler.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.310
"Stephen chandler,A.A.C."

07:43.410 --> 07:45.560
- "A.A.C." --It means
"at any cost." - Okay.

07:45.810 --> 07:47.050
Margo bishop.

07:47.540 --> 07:49.210
Margo bishop.

07:50.810 --> 07:52.690
Unos offered hera donor this morning.

07:53.290 --> 07:54.330
They did?

07:54.450 --> 07:57.800
59,county general.Right there.

07:57.910 --> 07:59.350
What's "L.I.G."?

07:59.880 --> 08:01.090
"Let it go."

08:03.910 --> 08:06.740
"Let it go"?

08:18.550 --> 08:20.010
How is she?

08:20.260 --> 08:21.980
No one was reading.

08:22.090 --> 08:23.450
Sweetheart.

08:24.560 --> 08:26.600
"As we are so...

08:28.140 --> 08:30.470
we are so wonderfully done."

08:30.860 --> 08:31.940
Excuse me?

08:32.070 --> 08:33.720
Would you like tohear it again?

08:36.700 --> 08:38.220
think I packed it.

08:40.460 --> 08:42.380
We found a donorfor margo.

08:43.450 --> 08:44.480
But dr.
Grant said --

08:44.580 --> 08:46.590
no,we're confidentthat
we can make it work.

08:51.580 --> 08:53.250
I don't understand.

08:53.370 --> 08:55.100
A donor's available.

08:58.590 --> 09:00.830
Dr. Grant was very clearabout her.

09:00.940 --> 09:02.210
The donor was a match.

09:02.310 --> 09:04.190
He was very clear about
usingso many organs on a patient

09:04.490 --> 09:05.530
with such a low chanceof survival.

09:05.650 --> 09:08.110
You can't have itboth ways.

09:08.220 --> 09:09.080
Excuse me?

09:09.180 --> 09:11.300
Well,if you please
everyone,you please no one.

09:12.060 --> 09:13.360
Yes,but dr.
Grant is --

09:13.460 --> 09:15.620
if you want my supportto
bring you on to staff,

09:15.740 --> 09:17.780
I think you should
thinkabout following my lead

09:17.900 --> 09:18.940
instead of worryingabout a guy

09:19.050 --> 09:20.530
who doesn't rememberyour first name.

09:22.990 --> 09:24.820
Well,I'll prep miss bishop.

09:25.270 --> 09:26.630
Good.

09:30.740 --> 09:32.500
Why is margo bishopstill here?

09:32.630 --> 09:34.350
We founda suitable donor.

09:34.450 --> 09:36.800
Found? The donor was offered10
minutes before I left.

09:36.900 --> 09:37.600
I passed.

09:37.700 --> 09:40.170
I know. We discussed
it.She wants the transplant.

09:40.280 --> 09:43.310
We transplant her,she
willinfect,reject,and die.

09:43.440 --> 09:44.800
Well,there's that possibility.

09:44.900 --> 09:48.160
There's another possibilitythat
she will get her life back.

09:48.300 --> 09:50.910
She's prone to infection.The
organs are marginal.

09:51.040 --> 09:52.540
You put me in charge,dr. Grant.

09:52.670 --> 09:53.740
I asked
you to --

09:53.870 --> 09:54.710
when I'm in charge,

09:54.810 --> 09:56.960
this is my hospital,so
I'll do as I see fit.

09:57.090 --> 09:58.320
It is not your hospital.

09:58.440 --> 09:59.570
It is when you put mein chargE.

09:59.580 --> 10:00.510
Hey,you two.

10:00.640 --> 10:03.570
Margo bishop will diethe
moment you open her up.

10:03.720 --> 10:04.870
Oh,come on.You don't know that.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.090
I do,and you should,too.

10:06.190 --> 10:07.920
And the only reason you
don'tis that you have a fraction

10:08.070 --> 10:09.520
of the experienceof other doctors.

10:09.640 --> 10:10.860
I have 15 years.

10:10.990 --> 10:12.560
Of being shelteredby the very best,

10:12.670 --> 10:15.420
of being covered by the
besttransplant doctors in the world.

10:16.010 --> 10:17.020
I worked with them.

10:17.030 --> 10:18.250
you*****

10:18.340 --> 10:20.330
You cannot tell methat
the surgical procedures

10:20.410 --> 10:22.940
that I performedare not my own.you****

10:23.040 --> 10:25.430
I can tell youthat time and again,

10:25.540 --> 10:27.890
I've had to bail you outwhen
you got in over your head.

10:28.020 --> 10:32.320
Nathaniel,you need to comewith me. Now.

10:43.070 --> 10:45.850
I know.I was hard on him.

10:46.260 --> 10:49.060
Nathaniel,come here.

10:49.170 --> 10:50.170
Come here.

10:50.280 --> 10:51.950
Talk to me.

10:59.730 --> 11:02.330
Tripp jacobsnever grew up.

11:02.450 --> 11:03.860
It wasn't entirelyhis fault.

11:03.970 --> 11:06.080
Bart and janetdidn't exactly help.

11:06.170 --> 11:08.190
I can't let him go againstbart's wishes.

11:08.330 --> 11:11.350
It's their family,nathaniel.

11:16.160 --> 11:18.070
Go pack your kit.

11:18.200 --> 11:20.220
- What?
- Pack your surgical kit.

11:20.710 --> 11:22.460
There's a donor30
miles south of columbus

11:22.570 --> 11:23.810
for stephen chandler.

11:24.160 --> 11:25.900
I saw the chart.

11:26.730 --> 11:28.100
The bronch doesn't look goodon paper,

11:28.220 --> 11:30.300
and the lungsmay be too far-gone.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.520
Well,let's take a chance on it.

11:32.640 --> 11:33.560
Kate
--

11:33.680 --> 11:35.270
there's nothing moreyou can do for bart.

11:35.410 --> 11:36.940
You shouldn't be hereright now.

11:37.070 --> 11:40.170
So let's you and meget
in the car,take a ride.

11:40.290 --> 11:41.460
We'll come back later.

11:41.580 --> 11:42.230
Katie
--

11:42.350 --> 11:44.080
let's just get out of herefor the day.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.250
The drive,the recovery of the lungs,

11:50.370 --> 11:51.930
and the returnwill take 10 hours.

11:52.050 --> 11:54.330
He keeps coughing.He
can't catch his breath.

11:54.480 --> 11:55.450
We won't be able to begin

11:55.580 --> 11:57.920
stephen's prepuntil we see the lungs.

11:58.280 --> 12:01.200
Stephen,in the interim,we'll
have to intubate you.

12:01.330 --> 12:02.180
N-no.

12:02.590 --> 12:04.550
He doesn't want thatever again.

12:04.670 --> 12:07.460
You have
no idea --

12:07.570 --> 12:09.250
I understandhow uncomfortable it is.

12:09.640 --> 12:12.460
Tube. Throat.

12:12.580 --> 12:13.750
If we ventilate you,

12:13.890 --> 12:16.110
you stand a much better chance,stephen.

12:17.190 --> 12:19.650
Mr. Chandler,your
son'sdecreasing lung function

12:19.750 --> 12:21.690
is compromising his heart.

12:21.820 --> 12:24.560
If we don't ventilate
him,his heart may fail.

12:28.060 --> 12:30.530
I know.I know how hard this is.

12:31.490 --> 12:35.930
We don't knowif the lungs are good.

12:37.770 --> 12:41.700
Once he's on the vent,can
you take him off again?

12:41.840 --> 12:43.340
He needs a transplant.

12:43.480 --> 12:45.910
These are the risksthat come with that.

12:52.410 --> 12:55.450
We've got to do it,stephen.

13:06.870 --> 13:10.200
Mary,keep me updatedon
stephen chandler's condition.

13:10.540 --> 13:12.200
Dr. Jonas,you know my orders.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.270
Sure.

13:22.150 --> 13:27.520
That was absolutelythe
worst wedding party ever.

13:27.710 --> 13:28.880
I wasn't that late.

13:29.000 --> 13:29.830
I had to talk to the wife

13:29.950 --> 13:31.390
of that insane surgeonfrom georgetown.

13:31.500 --> 13:33.190
What was her name?

13:33.480 --> 13:36.050
Claudette dubois.

13:36.190 --> 13:38.430
And her husbandquoting socrates.

13:38.550 --> 13:40.060
He was a rhodes scholar.

13:40.170 --> 13:42.930
He was a bore,and you
were two hours late.

13:43.070 --> 13:44.690
I was in surgery.

13:44.820 --> 13:47.150
Poor bart,giving yet another speech

13:47.260 --> 13:49.880
at yet another oneof
tripp's many weddings.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.130
Mm-hmm.Bart always loved him.

13:53.270 --> 13:56.320
No matter how strangehis
relationship with tripp was.

13:57.280 --> 13:59.650
Bart,after he hired me,

13:59.790 --> 14:03.280
every night,7:00,packed
his bag and went home.

14:04.310 --> 14:05.810
Janet used to say to me,

14:05.930 --> 14:09.170
"wait till nathanielhas
his own staff to abuse."

14:17.650 --> 14:18.830
I'm sorry.

14:18.960 --> 14:20.920
No. No,you're right.

14:21.760 --> 14:24.070
Not the right dayfor it.

14:29.980 --> 14:32.200
look out there.

14:35.010 --> 14:37.830
Look at all that life.

14:55.560 --> 14:58.780
you got your liver,your
spleen,your pancreas.

15:00.180 --> 15:01.580
So,how do they look?

15:01.720 --> 15:03.390
Pretty good,hmm?

15:03.400 --> 15:06.530
Small intestine,stomach,spleen,duodenum.

15:06.620 --> 15:07.760
So they're good?

15:07.870 --> 15:09.070
Marginal.

15:09.210 --> 15:10.380
Hey,this is the right move.

15:10.500 --> 15:11.450
That donor in about an hour

15:11.590 --> 15:14.460
isn't worth anything to
anybodyexcept for our patient.

15:14.560 --> 15:16.880
She and her motherhave
agreed to proceed.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.420
Can we do thiswithout dr. Grant?

15:18.550 --> 15:19.690
We don't needhis permission.

15:19.810 --> 15:21.810
Can we physicallydo this?

15:22.230 --> 15:24.180
I mean,there are so many
organsto transplant in there.

15:24.290 --> 15:25.860
Look,she is gonna diein hospice.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.920
If she dies on that table,at
least she went with a fight.

15:31.960 --> 15:33.710
I'm just saying...

15:39.100 --> 15:41.590
I'm good.Let's do this.

15:42.030 --> 15:43.180
All right!

15:44.310 --> 15:46.170
Let's do this.

15:48.180 --> 15:50.210
Kidney,liver,pancreas.

15:50.340 --> 15:53.580
Stomach,intestine,spleen.Oh,my.

16:14.530 --> 16:15.510
How's it going?

16:15.650 --> 16:18.420
Blood work looks fine.Medical
history is trickier.

16:18.530 --> 16:19.400
Why?

16:19.420 --> 16:20.580
The parents weren'tvery
close to their child.

16:20.690 --> 16:22.830
They neversaw the suicide coming.

16:22.980 --> 16:24.310
But we're good to go.

16:24.440 --> 16:26.940
Not yet.They want to speak to a doctor.

16:27.220 --> 16:28.530
Why?

16:28.640 --> 16:30.750
They want to know exactlywhat
will happen to their son.

16:33.950 --> 16:35.360
Me?

16:36.100 --> 16:38.650
You're here.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.470
It's really remarkable.

16:44.180 --> 16:47.730
If you agree to donate,we
remove your son's organs,

16:47.860 --> 16:50.110
drive them backto pittsburgh,

16:50.230 --> 16:52.290
where my patientis waiting right now.

16:52.430 --> 16:54.600
My patient --he's
a young kid.

16:54.770 --> 16:58.030
Cystic fibrosis.He can't breathe.

16:58.140 --> 17:01.430
He's never reallybeen able to breathe.

17:02.250 --> 17:04.349
In any event...

17:04.849 --> 17:07.400
we remove my patient'sdiseased lungs,

17:07.520 --> 17:09.599
and we replace themwith your son'S.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.550
There's a moment...

17:14.890 --> 17:18.190
when you first placethose new lungs

17:18.339 --> 17:20.829
insidea sick person's body

17:21.670 --> 17:25.349
and those perfectnew lungs inflate.

17:28.200 --> 17:31.360
It's really more amazingthan
watching a heart beating.

17:33.560 --> 17:38.190
It's like a birth
--that breath.

17:38.320 --> 17:40.600
It's the thing of life,you know.

17:43.800 --> 17:45.450
Breath.

17:46.220 --> 17:49.350
Giving someonethe ability to breathe.

17:54.700 --> 17:56.710
Thatoes it.Let's lift it out.

17:57.170 --> 17:58.940
All right. You got it?

17:59.370 --> 18:00.340
Yeah.

18:00.460 --> 18:02.320
Okay.Are we all clamped off?

18:02.460 --> 18:03.980
Once we get the old
liver out,we have an hour

18:04.110 --> 18:07.040
before we have to get the
newliver in and functioning.

18:07.900 --> 18:09.090
Okay.

18:10.300 --> 18:14.250
This is where the
actualtransplant begins.

18:17.640 --> 18:20.640
Come on.This is where the fun begins.

18:25.140 --> 18:26.950
We're just getting started,people.

18:28.770 --> 18:30.260
We're justgetting started.

18:30.890 --> 18:32.870
Dr. Grant'son the phone.

18:33.340 --> 18:34.440
Tell him we're busy.

18:34.550 --> 18:36.200
This is the second timehe's called.

18:37.710 --> 18:39.630
He wants to knowwhat you're doing.

18:39.990 --> 18:41.480
Hey,dr. Grant.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.740
We just took the liver out,so
we're already committed.

18:43.870 --> 18:44.950
How's the patient doing?

18:45.080 --> 18:45.790
She's good.

18:45.910 --> 18:49.340
You don't have to explain
it.What's done is done.

18:49.680 --> 18:50.860
Make sureyou have the liver functioning

18:50.970 --> 18:52.820
before you move onto the intestines.

18:53.310 --> 18:55.050
The other recovery teamnever arrived.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.170
Fine.

18:56.300 --> 18:58.260
Yeah,give it about10
minutes to make sure.

18:58.390 --> 19:00.570
Otherwise,you riskwasting
all the other organs.

19:00.610 --> 19:01.680
Okay

19:02.900 --> 19:03.970
What is it?

19:04.070 --> 19:05.380
It's jonas.

19:05.500 --> 19:07.420
He went aheadwith the multivisceral.

19:08.470 --> 19:10.170
Do you need to get back?

19:10.760 --> 19:11.620
No.

19:11.750 --> 19:13.650
I can waitfor another recovery team.

19:13.790 --> 19:16.450
We're here.We can do it ourselves.

19:17.550 --> 19:20.180
You want me to
recoverthe lungs with you?

19:20.310 --> 19:21.170
Why not?

19:21.310 --> 19:23.430
I haven't done thatin years.

19:23.860 --> 19:25.560
Why not?

19:30.290 --> 19:31.180
good.

19:31.290 --> 19:33.430
Hey,the liver is working.You see that?

19:33.550 --> 19:35.240
It's producing bile.

19:36.950 --> 19:38.900
Okay. Simon,how are you
doingwith the intestines?

19:39.030 --> 19:40.800
We're justgetting started here.

19:40.940 --> 19:42.090
I'll take it from here.

19:43.280 --> 19:44.450
You just did the liver.

19:44.580 --> 19:46.750
Yeah,I know,but I feel strong.

19:50.640 --> 19:52.400
Dr. Jonas,you just did the whole liver.

19:52.530 --> 19:53.580
I thinkI'm good to go here.

19:53.710 --> 19:55.440
I'm not sayingthat you're not.

19:55.840 --> 19:57.820
Go ahead. Take a seat.Take a break.

19:59.240 --> 20:00.520
I thinkI'll stick with you.

20:00.640 --> 20:04.040
Take a break.You're gonna need it later.

20:10.990 --> 20:12.800
- All righty.You
okay? - Uh-huh.

20:14.190 --> 20:15.570
How's the bronch?

20:15.700 --> 20:17.400
Not infected.Looks good.

20:17.530 --> 20:19.020
Good thing we came.

20:19.900 --> 20:21.860
Ready to cross-clamp.

20:26.870 --> 20:28.400
Ice is ready.

20:29.730 --> 20:31.290
Suctioning.

20:31.840 --> 20:33.400
Do we
have,uh --

20:33.520 --> 20:35.850
blood?In the lymph nodes as well.

20:36.890 --> 20:40.640
Pressure looks good.Fusing well.

20:41.660 --> 20:43.200
Ready to take them out?

20:43.880 --> 20:46.050
Mm-hmm.

20:54.190 --> 20:55.790
How we doing,dr. Jonas?

20:55.920 --> 20:57.630
I need some water.

20:58.570 --> 20:59.950
It's coming.

21:00.730 --> 21:03.470
- Here you go,dr. Jonas.
- Mmm.

21:05.380 --> 21:06.610
Thank you.

21:07.430 --> 21:09.530
Okay. Deviki clamp.

21:09.660 --> 21:11.280
Duval,duval.

21:12.400 --> 21:14.820
Yeah. Duval clamp.

21:15.320 --> 21:16.950
She's bleeding.

21:17.710 --> 21:18.880
Well,clearly.

21:19.150 --> 21:21.140
No,the suturesaren't holding.

21:21.670 --> 21:23.870
Okay,that's justone
of the smaller vessels.

21:23.990 --> 21:27.030
No,no. She's leaking fromone
of the anastomosis sites.

21:27.180 --> 21:28.580
Suction,suction.

21:29.860 --> 21:30.920
Suction.Suction. I can't see.

21:31.040 --> 21:31.930
I can.It's right there.

21:32.040 --> 21:33.560
I have it. I have it.

21:33.690 --> 21:35.640
Dr. Jonas.It's not the ileo.

21:35.760 --> 21:37.440
Blood pressure?

21:37.570 --> 21:39.240
60 over 40,dropping.

21:39.360 --> 21:42.180
Damn it.I really think it's the ileo.

21:42.300 --> 21:44.600
It's the gastric-gastricconnection.
Dr. Jonas?

21:45.800 --> 21:47.400
You're exhausted.I'm gonna step in.

21:48.680 --> 21:50.340
Coming around.

21:51.140 --> 21:52.940
Heart rate's up.I have it.

21:53.330 --> 21:54.840
Dr. Jonas?It's under the stomach.

21:55.380 --> 21:57.080
We need to get upunder
the stomach right in here.

21:57.190 --> 21:59.360
There it is,right there.Dr.
Jonas,please step back.

22:00.360 --> 22:02.040
Hold that just like that.Got it.

22:02.490 --> 22:04.470
I can see it.I just can't quite...

22:04.990 --> 22:06.340
give me your finger.

22:06.790 --> 22:09.010
- Put it right there.You feel that?
- Yeah

22:09.740 --> 22:10.920
Great.

22:11.370 --> 22:13.240
Excuse me,dr. Jonas.

22:13.650 --> 22:15.270
There it is.It is the gastric-gastric.

22:16.010 --> 22:17.580
Just hang on to that
thingone more second.

22:19.090 --> 22:19.900
We're almost there.

22:20.030 --> 22:21.550
Here you go.Let's have
a clamp here,please.

22:23.480 --> 22:26.460
Great,let's have a 5-0 pro
leadon the needle holder,please.

22:27.570 --> 22:30.540
The artery is so porous.I
need a smaller needle.

22:30.550 --> 22:32.240
There you go.You got it.

22:33.400 --> 22:34.770
Yeah.Yeah,I think I have it.

22:34.900 --> 22:37.570
Heart rate's steady.Good blood flow.

22:37.700 --> 22:38.700
I think that's got it.

22:38.830 --> 22:40.210
Good. Pressure's up.

22:40.340 --> 22:41.890
I thinkwe're out of the woods.

22:43.430 --> 22:46.630
Okay.Removing the clamp.

22:47.270 --> 22:49.470
Sutures are holding.

22:57.920 --> 22:58.990
That was fun.

22:59.110 --> 23:00.190
Fun?

23:00.310 --> 23:02.480
Performing a recoverywith you.

23:03.700 --> 23:05.430
It's beena very long time.

23:06.230 --> 23:07.670
You were excellent.

23:11.130 --> 23:12.720
Am I wrong about bart?

23:13.050 --> 23:15.260
You know what he wants.

23:15.740 --> 23:17.590
I could have pushedso much harder.

23:17.720 --> 23:20.130
For the reduction,for
doing a transplant.

23:20.260 --> 23:23.350
Bart more than anyone knowswhat
it would be like to try.

23:23.520 --> 23:26.740
He made a choice to
spendhis remaining time well.

23:26.860 --> 23:28.940
We could go backand make one last push.

23:29.060 --> 23:30.560
You don'treally mean that.

23:30.680 --> 23:32.040
Well,shouldn't I bedoing something?

23:32.190 --> 23:35.420
You are.Right now you are.

23:40.160 --> 23:42.220
Jonas.

23:42.930 --> 23:44.830
- What?
- You like him?

23:47.380 --> 23:49.250
He asked me to dinner.

23:52.270 --> 23:54.940
I wasn't talking about
dinner.I meant as a surgeon.

23:56.090 --> 23:57.800
Oh.

24:00.230 --> 24:01.410
I do.

24:01.550 --> 24:04.320
I thinkhe is a very good surgeon.

24:08.090 --> 24:10.260
And as a dinner date?

24:11.200 --> 24:13.520
You can tell methe truth.

24:14.910 --> 24:17.020

25:45.980 --> 25:47.870
You are more his sonthan tripp.

25:48.210 --> 25:51.400
I'm his student,his
friend,his colleague.

25:51.530 --> 25:53.040
But I'm not his son.

25:53.060 --> 25:54.520
All right.

25:55.700 --> 25:58.660
I just don't want to do
anythingto hurt janet is all.

26:00.250 --> 26:05.130

26:12.460 --> 26:16.050

26:23.690 --> 26:25.890
She's in recovery.

26:26.500 --> 26:29.240
Well,let's just hopeit all works out.

26:33.430 --> 26:35.390

Yeah,just
--just tired.

27:21.510 --> 27:23.770
hey.That was incredible.

27:24.150 --> 27:26.360
The way you handledthat
complication --

27:26.470 --> 27:28.510
I've never seen a fellowdo that.

27:28.620 --> 27:29.410
It was beautiful.

27:29.530 --> 27:31.190
Yeah? Thanks.

27:31.320 --> 27:33.180
Hey,I'm almost done roundingif
you want to go out --

27:33.310 --> 27:34.310

27:34.440 --> 27:35.690
Great.

28:09.570 --> 28:13.170
I've got a code in
room 123!Code 1-2-3!

28:39.770 --> 28:42.020
I'll go tell her mother.

29:10.750 --> 29:12.500
Do you always playat
3:00 in the morning?

29:16.640 --> 29:20.870
So...dr. Grantscheduled my final review.

29:26.120 --> 29:28.320
We're,uh --we're
good,right?

29:28.440 --> 29:30.940
I mean,after today,you
saidthat we were good,so...

29:32.050 --> 29:33.900
I gave you my word.

29:37.310 --> 29:39.260
Good,'cause,I mean,you know,

29:39.390 --> 29:41.490
dr. Grant's onlyever
basically seen me screw up,

29:41.640 --> 29:45.070
so I,you know,after today,I
feel like I really showed

29:45.200 --> 29:46.530
my way arounda difficult procedure.

29:46.640 --> 29:48.580
Yeah,and it was noted.

29:49.510 --> 29:50.750
I mean,I know
that the outcome --

29:50.870 --> 29:52.450
it's been noted.

29:57.670 --> 30:00.260
After the
outcome,I --

30:00.900 --> 30:02.230
I know thatwhat
I'm asking for --

30:02.360 --> 30:04.990
vancouver,we lost a patient today.

30:05.130 --> 30:07.410
So I get it.I get it,okay?

30:07.550 --> 30:08.850
I get thatyou're more concerned

30:08.990 --> 30:11.100
with keeping your job
herethan anything else.

30:11.210 --> 30:12.940
Did I do somethingto piss you off?

30:13.080 --> 30:14.310
Other than askingfor a reward

30:14.430 --> 30:17.150
after we justlost a patient,no.

30:17.270 --> 30:20.380
That patient -- she would
havedied on that table.

30:20.520 --> 30:21.900
Be careful.

30:22.030 --> 30:24.270
If I hadn't have stepped
in,she would have died.

30:24.410 --> 30:27.350
What you did in therewasn't anything

30:27.470 --> 30:30.960
anyone elsehadn't done before.

30:35.930 --> 30:38.720
Would you ratherI just
let her die on the table?

30:40.560 --> 30:42.670
Thrown up my handsand acted like

30:42.780 --> 30:45.270
I was as lostas you were in there?

30:55.010 --> 30:57.370
You made me a promise,tom.

31:07.030 --> 31:08.980
I know what I did.

31:12.990 --> 31:14.750
I just want to make...

31:17.910 --> 31:20.620
I just want to make
sureyou intend to keep it.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.870
Yeah?

31:36.490 --> 31:39.080
Okay,yes.Go ahead.

31:39.690 --> 31:41.140
Say it.

31:43.660 --> 31:45.070
Bart's herein the hospital.

31:45.180 --> 31:47.210
He doesn'thave much time left.

31:53.260 --> 31:55.640
Well,I'm sorry.

31:57.260 --> 31:58.470
I need to be with himright now.

31:58.600 --> 32:00.880
I need to make surethat
everything's all right.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.270
Okay,uh...

32:03.420 --> 32:05.200
I'll --I'll
follow your orders.

32:05.330 --> 32:09.290
You just,uh,tell mehow
you want things to be run.

32:09.420 --> 32:12.200
You can handle thingsthe
way you see fit.

32:17.410 --> 32:18.600
Are you sure about that?

32:18.740 --> 32:20.840
That's what you're hereto do,right?

32:22.490 --> 32:24.250
Yeah.

32:26.770 --> 32:29.400
Dr. Grant.

32:33.600 --> 32:36.790
About vancouver,uh...

32:38.130 --> 32:40.070
he's worth keeping around,

32:40.200 --> 32:42.780
if,you know,you want my input.

32:43.530 --> 32:45.730
Of course I do.

33:01.140 --> 33:02.660
Two creams,two sugars.

33:04.160 --> 33:05.920
Thank you.

33:09.340 --> 33:11.570
I thought if we couldn'tgo to dinner...

33:11.730 --> 33:15.390
yeah,we can haveanother
cup of coffee. Nice.

33:16.590 --> 33:18.450
Another cup of coffee.

33:49.500 --> 33:51.800
He's not ready to go.

33:52.500 --> 33:56.070
Tripp,he made the decisionto
go a long time ago.

33:56.200 --> 33:58.460
You didn't see the fearin his eyes.

33:58.590 --> 34:00.650
You didn't hear him gaspingfor breath.

34:00.770 --> 34:02.900
It's what happens.He,of
all people,knows that.

34:03.030 --> 34:04.310
He is not ready to go.

34:04.430 --> 34:07.220
He's past saving.

34:07.340 --> 34:10.060
His lungs are permanentlyscarred,tripp.

34:10.699 --> 34:12.480
He choseto skip the transplant

34:12.610 --> 34:14.580
and is now past survivingthat surgery.

34:14.710 --> 34:18.440
All he is nowis a man on a pump.

34:19.870 --> 34:23.239
And you and I both knowthat
your father is far greater,

34:23.360 --> 34:25.670
far more dignifiedthan that.

34:27.690 --> 34:31.920
Tripp,bart loves you so very much.

34:32.060 --> 34:35.989
He took so much pridein not taking out

34:36.120 --> 34:38.840
all of his rageand his ambition on you.

34:38.980 --> 34:40.670
He wanted to shield youfrom all of that.

34:40.810 --> 34:42.420
He took it out on youinstead.

34:42.560 --> 34:46.860
Yes,he did.I got all
of those great gifts.

34:55.800 --> 34:58.400
I don't knowhow to do this.

35:01.670 --> 35:05.670
He didn't teach mehow to do this.

35:07.650 --> 35:09.790
I can't tell youwhat to do.

35:09.930 --> 35:11.990
He's your father.

35:13.360 --> 35:16.820
But,tripp,you have to take care of him

35:16.970 --> 35:19.460
the way he took careof you.

35:22.020 --> 35:25.570
He needs you to be
strongfor him now,tripp.

35:25.700 --> 35:28.160
It's time,honey.

35:28.290 --> 35:31.970
It's time to let him go.

36:23.240 --> 36:26.240
You rememberstephen chandler,

36:26.770 --> 36:29.800
that kidwith the cystic fibrosis?

36:30.250 --> 36:32.940
He's turned outso
beautifully --

36:33.060 --> 36:36.820
graduate degree in
engineeringfrom carnegie mellon.

36:37.120 --> 36:42.830
He came up with this ideaof
a new way to transport lungs.

36:43.300 --> 36:46.390
It's remarkable. Really.

36:46.530 --> 36:49.860
Somethingwe could actually make.

36:50.470 --> 36:53.050
We gave him new lungslast night.

36:55.760 --> 36:58.680
Bought him some timeto do
the things he wants to do.

37:00.310 --> 37:03.070
Bought him some time.

37:13.150 --> 37:15.470
Are you ready,bart?

37:27.690 --> 37:30.270
I love you,bart.

37:36.450 --> 37:41.010

38:16.580 --> 38:20.180
Oh,I'm --I'm
just working.

38:59.630 --> 39:01.950
He's ready.

40:10.730 --> 40:13.250
You can startthe morphine drip.

40:21.660 --> 40:24.140
He won't haveany anxieties now.

40:24.270 --> 40:27.330
I promise.

40:37.600 --> 40:40.990
"As we are so wonderfullydone
with each other..."

40:45.420 --> 40:47.530
