around the same time.

11:11.170 --> 11:13.005

11:35.528 --> 11:37.196
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:37.279 --> 11:39.782
I just thought me and Alice
would be together forever.

11:39.865 --> 11:42.118
That was never gonna happen.

11:42.201 --> 11:45.371

for practice,

11:45.454 --> 11:47.832

11:47.915 --> 11:49.250
No way, really?

Oh, yeah, it's in the Talmud,
and that's what I'm counting on.

so much about life.

Do you think Alice will take me back

As you know, my faith prohibits me
from using a telephone on the Sabbath,

God forgives many sins but not arson,

27:13.673 --> 27:15.842
especially of an anti-Semitic nature.

Unlike the burning bush,

27:17.886 --> 27:20.013
the fire your son caused this evening

27:20.096 --> 27:23.183
did consume
my temple's beautiful front lawn

27:23.266 --> 27:24.559
and our sign,

27:24.642 --> 27:27.479
which, of course, was donated
by Sammy Davis Jr.
