00:10.920 --> 00:13.950
Through your goodness we
have this bread to offer,

00:14.000 --> 00:17.840
which earth has given and
human hands have made...

00:20.520 --> 00:24.510
.. where it will become
for us the bread of life.

00:24.560 --> 00:26.760
Blessed be God for ever.

00:29.840 --> 00:31.750
Let us pray, brethren,

00:31.800 --> 00:39.310
that our sacrifice may be acceptable
to God, Our Almighty Father.

00:39.360 --> 00:43.790
May the Lord accept the sacrifice
at your hands for the praise

00:43.840 --> 00:45.910
and glory of His name.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.074

01:29.840 --> 01:32.550
Perhaps I can be of
assistance, Father?

01:32.600 --> 01:34.750
I was wondering if there
was a safe place where

01:34.800 --> 01:36.030
I could leave my bicycle.

01:36.080 --> 01:37.310
We're honest men here.

01:37.360 --> 01:40.470
That makes my job easier.
I'm here to take confession.

01:40.520 --> 01:43.270
As student guest master, it's my
duty to escort all visitors...

01:43.320 --> 01:45.230
I'm sure that won't be necessary.

01:45.280 --> 01:47.590
Father Brown is an Upcott Old Boy.

01:47.640 --> 01:49.910
Long overdue for a visit.

01:50.960 --> 01:53.470
Better get to lectures, Mr Wolfe.

01:53.520 --> 01:56.510
There is nothing to be
learned through loitering.

01:56.560 --> 01:58.630
Welcome back, Father.

02:00.520 --> 02:01.910
~ Diligent.
~ Clearly.

02:01.960 --> 02:04.670
As his spiritual director,
I've recommended him

02:04.720 --> 02:06.550
for the Westminster archdiocese.

02:06.600 --> 02:07.910
High praise indeed.

02:07.960 --> 02:10.350
A seminarian with promise
should always be encouraged.

02:10.400 --> 02:12.350
I thought I might drop
in on the rector.

02:12.400 --> 02:16.630
~ He's over at the monastery gardens.
~ No change there then.

02:16.680 --> 02:20.710
Father Palfreyman's behaviour
of late has somewhat

02:20.760 --> 02:23.270
been cause for concern.

02:23.320 --> 02:27.710
Erratic, absent-minded,
the vagaries of old age.

02:27.760 --> 02:28.830
It comes to us all.

02:28.880 --> 02:32.280
Perhaps it's time he thought
about retirement.

02:32.800 --> 02:35.470
With you in line to replace him?

02:35.520 --> 02:38.820
I only have the interests
of Upcott at heart.

02:39.320 --> 02:40.720
Indeed.

02:51.240 --> 02:54.750
Father Brown! What
a pleasant surprise.

02:54.800 --> 02:58.110
You invited me to hear confessions.

02:58.160 --> 03:00.270
Yes, of course.

03:00.320 --> 03:03.510
Still rooting out evil
and planting virtue.

03:03.560 --> 03:06.680
Food for the table. Medicinal herbs.

03:07.920 --> 03:11.710
You must join us next week for
the Feast of the Assumption.

03:11.760 --> 03:15.390
It's high time our students
had something to celebrate.

03:15.440 --> 03:17.550
I read the findings of the inquest.

03:17.600 --> 03:20.680
Douglas Hitchens. He
worked with me here.

03:22.360 --> 03:24.230
Death by misadventure.

03:24.280 --> 03:27.270
At least now he'll be
able to rest in peace.

03:27.320 --> 03:29.510
I'll get this lot over to
the kitchen, Father Rector.

03:29.560 --> 03:31.030
Mr Risley.

03:31.720 --> 03:37.160
Make sure you elect somebody
else to peel them. Obedience.

03:39.800 --> 03:44.040
Mr Risley, serial volunteer.
Reliably pious.

03:45.600 --> 03:48.470
It's an arduous path
to spiritual perfection.

03:48.520 --> 03:52.270
Yes, Douglas's passing
has tested our faith.

03:52.320 --> 03:55.520
We must bear our suffering
lightly, as our Lord did.

03:58.800 --> 04:02.070
I hear you're losing Father McNeive?

04:02.120 --> 04:03.270
Borneo.

04:03.320 --> 04:06.400
At least that missionary
zeal will not go to waste.

04:07.600 --> 04:10.400
Potts, I was hoping to run into you.

04:10.920 --> 04:12.150
I was getting some air.

04:12.200 --> 04:16.320
Feverfew. Boil the
flowers up into a tea.

04:17.760 --> 04:19.390
It's kind of you to think of me.

04:19.440 --> 04:24.070
Seminal year. We can't have
you wasted in the infirmary.

04:24.120 --> 04:25.710
I'll be late for Theory.

04:25.760 --> 04:28.500
Father Lewis will never forgive me.

04:31.440 --> 04:33.390
Migraine.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.750
An unfortunate affliction.

04:34.800 --> 04:39.150
Yes, not uncommon for those
with a nervous disposition.

04:39.200 --> 04:41.740
What would they do without you?

04:43.440 --> 04:48.640
God entrusted these men to my care.
Upcott needs me more than ever.

04:51.960 --> 04:53.560
Better then?

04:54.560 --> 04:56.550
~ I'll live.
~ You didn't miss much.

04:56.600 --> 04:59.590
A lecture from Lewis on
the practice of prayer.

04:59.640 --> 05:01.670
The usual fire and brimstone.

05:01.720 --> 05:04.470
I've been having those
nightmares again.

05:04.520 --> 05:07.840
This is reparation. We
stepped away from God.

05:09.080 --> 05:13.070
You'll bear the burden of
your conscience quietly...

05:13.120 --> 05:14.710
if you're truly one of us.

05:14.760 --> 05:17.150
I'm not sure I am any more.

05:17.200 --> 05:20.070
Of course you are. We need you.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.470
Ask for guidance during
afternoon prayers.

05:22.520 --> 05:25.910
I'm taking this to Palfreyman.
He needs to know the truth.

05:25.960 --> 05:28.910
~ You swore an oath.
~ I should never have kept this quiet.

05:28.960 --> 05:31.960
Betray your pledge
and you'll pay for it.

05:35.360 --> 05:36.960
As you were.

05:43.520 --> 05:49.550
Mr Potts, recovered, I hope, from
your latest unfortunate malady.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.790
I shall endeavour
to catch up, Father.

05:51.840 --> 05:56.600
Your absence from the study group
has been cause for some concern.

05:58.080 --> 06:01.020
We wouldn't want to
emulate Mr Risley.

06:01.880 --> 06:05.840
A cursory grasp of basic theology
and double Dutch Latin.

06:06.920 --> 06:08.310
Mea culpa, Father.

06:08.360 --> 06:11.360
Hardly worthy of a
seminary scholarship.

06:13.760 --> 06:21.270
Mr Wolfe, your writing on theophany
showed rare insight.

06:21.320 --> 06:24.840
Thank you, Father. We
can only try our best.

06:29.880 --> 06:33.840
A priest acts in the
person of CHRIST!

06:35.240 --> 06:40.000
The head of His Body, the Church.

06:41.800 --> 06:46.110
Are you all worthy?

06:46.160 --> 06:49.560
~ Yes, Father.
~ I need to be excused. Headache.

06:51.560 --> 06:53.720
If you must.

07:15.760 --> 07:19.960
~ Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
~ What brings you here today?

07:22.800 --> 07:26.590
I was there at the lake,
the night Hitchens died.

07:26.640 --> 07:28.840
On the seminary retreat.

07:29.480 --> 07:33.080
He drowned in the shadow
of the apostolic palace.

07:33.840 --> 07:36.510
The bell was ringing for Angelus!

07:39.440 --> 07:42.440
I closed my eyes to a terrible thing!

07:44.160 --> 07:47.910
You know that whatever you
say will remain between us.

07:47.960 --> 07:51.070
~ We took an oath of allegiance.
~ Who did?

07:51.120 --> 07:52.790
The chosen few.

07:52.840 --> 07:55.750
Better men, better lives.

07:55.800 --> 07:57.710
And where are the chosen few now?

07:57.760 --> 08:00.510
Far from God, tainted by sin.

08:00.560 --> 08:04.120
How can I ever take the Holy Orders?

08:05.680 --> 08:07.820
What happened in Italy?

08:18.280 --> 08:19.750
Mr Potts?

08:26.040 --> 08:27.510
Mr Potts?

09:53.800 --> 09:56.080
Better men. Better lives.

10:03.560 --> 10:06.430
I was speaking to Potts this morning.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.590
I should have seen the signs.

10:09.640 --> 10:11.580
We're all culpable.

10:13.640 --> 10:16.030
Rector?

10:16.080 --> 10:19.180
Angina. I just need
to get my breath back.

10:32.160 --> 10:34.070
Father Brown. Well, well.

10:34.120 --> 10:37.840
~ I shouldn't be surprised, I suppose.
~ Upcott is my alma mater.

10:39.320 --> 10:44.350
You certainly pick your moments.
Clearly a suicide.

10:44.400 --> 10:46.830
You seem very sure of that.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.910
Mental frailties.

10:48.960 --> 10:52.190
Alluded to in a statement
from Father Lewis.

10:52.240 --> 10:54.950
Strange he chose to jump backwards.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.200
Perhaps he couldn't look
death in the face?

11:01.240 --> 11:04.670
His pupils are very... dilated.

11:04.720 --> 11:07.750
Yes, we'll need to
do a full postmortem.

11:07.800 --> 11:10.630
It's hard to believe he jumped.

11:10.680 --> 11:12.990
It does seem improbable.

11:13.040 --> 11:16.550
~ How well did you know Thomas Potts?
~ We had neighbouring rooms.

11:16.600 --> 11:19.830
~ Did he seem at all troubled to you?
~ We'd barely seen him.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.790
And where were you
at the time of death?

11:21.840 --> 11:24.710
~ In the chapel.
~ You were loitering in the quad.

11:24.760 --> 11:27.030
I was late for prayers myself,
waylaid in the kitchen.

11:27.080 --> 11:30.200
~ I can vouch for Mr Wolfe.
~ We went in together.

11:31.200 --> 11:36.040
Right. I heard Mr Potts'
confession before he died.

11:38.520 --> 11:41.270
Did he say anything that
might be important?

11:41.320 --> 11:43.750
I can't break the seal
of the confessional.

11:43.800 --> 11:48.230
How convenient. Everyone's
lips appear to be sealed.

11:48.280 --> 11:54.710
These men have lost a friend,
Inspector. Surely this can wait?

11:54.760 --> 11:57.750
Very well, but I will
need to take statements

11:57.800 --> 12:00.070
from all of you in due course.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.790
Go to your rooms and pray for him.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.430
Perhaps we should inspect
the tower...?

12:18.480 --> 12:20.390
I think I can manage
thank you, Father Brown.

12:20.440 --> 12:23.040
I'll see you back in Kembleford.

12:24.040 --> 12:27.740
This is what happens when
the men lack leadership.

12:27.960 --> 12:30.360
I have to inform the bishop.

12:31.720 --> 12:34.630
You don't look well, Rector.

12:34.680 --> 12:37.790
Maybe a lie down in the office?

12:37.840 --> 12:40.040
I have all this in hand.

13:01.480 --> 13:06.310
Father Brown. Surely you know
this room is out of bounds.

13:06.360 --> 13:09.510
No suicide note, in case
you were wondering.

13:09.560 --> 13:14.070
I suggest you leave now, before
I call for the inspector.

13:14.120 --> 13:17.590
You told the inspector
that Potts was unstable.

13:17.640 --> 13:21.390
Suicide is a mortal sin.

13:21.440 --> 13:25.910
Diminished responsibility carries
a small hope of salvation.

13:25.960 --> 13:30.110
Are you protecting
Mr Potts or yourself?

13:30.160 --> 13:34.240
I won't have this seminary
mired by another scandal.

13:36.880 --> 13:42.240
Last summer's retreat, you
chaperoned the students.

13:43.720 --> 13:47.200
~ The night Douglas Hitchens died...
~ A tragic accident.

13:50.080 --> 13:54.320
The burden of guilt
must weigh heavily.

13:55.400 --> 13:58.470
You've outstayed your
welcome, Father Brown.

13:58.520 --> 14:00.510
I'm not sure the rector
would agree with you.

14:00.560 --> 14:05.830
Father Palfreyman is indisposed,
which means I'm in charge.

14:05.880 --> 14:09.990
If you're not on your bike
within the next five minutes,

14:10.040 --> 14:13.190
I'll have you escorted
from the premises.

14:13.240 --> 14:15.440
That won't be necessary.

14:39.800 --> 14:42.070
I've been asked to leave.

14:42.640 --> 14:44.910
I'm tempted to come with you.

14:44.960 --> 14:46.950
You're needed here.

14:47.000 --> 14:52.520
Why would Potts choose to remove
himself from God's saving grace?

14:53.760 --> 14:55.550
I'm not convinced he did.

14:55.600 --> 15:00.070
~ The alternative doesn't bear scrutiny.
~ Murder.

15:00.120 --> 15:03.630
These men are being trained
for the priesthood!

15:03.680 --> 15:06.230
Potts was found with
a cross around his neck.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.350
Well, it's not unusual.

15:08.400 --> 15:12.150
It was enamelled with
cryptic symbols.

15:12.200 --> 15:14.190
They found one like that on Hitchens.

15:14.240 --> 15:17.920
Fourth shelf down, under the
stairs, his personal effects.

15:37.560 --> 15:39.830
Does this mean anything to you?

15:39.880 --> 15:43.310
Beyond the crossed keys of St Peter and
the clasped hands of friendship, no.

15:43.360 --> 15:45.120
Hm.

15:51.520 --> 15:53.630
This can't be just coincidence.

15:53.680 --> 15:57.800
You're not seriously suggesting
the two deaths are connected?

15:58.920 --> 16:02.190
Something terrible
happened by the lake.

16:02.240 --> 16:05.240
Something the faithful
colluded to hide.

16:05.920 --> 16:09.230
That is a heinous accusation.

16:09.280 --> 16:12.280
If Potts was killed
to hide a secret...

16:13.680 --> 16:17.590
We must question the seminarians
and find the truth.

16:17.640 --> 16:20.590
I don't think Father Lewis
will agree to that.

16:20.640 --> 16:22.110
Then what do you suggest?

16:22.160 --> 16:25.400
If there is a murderer in Upcott,
we need to flush him out.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.790
~ A game of cat and mouse.
~ I was thinking more of a mole.

16:30.840 --> 16:33.350
~ I couldn't possibly.
~ A keen seminarian,

16:33.400 --> 16:36.710
~ a bit wet behind the ears.
~ It wouldn't be ethical.

16:36.760 --> 16:38.830
Easy to confide in...

16:40.520 --> 16:43.190
Where do you propose to find him?

16:44.040 --> 16:46.910
A trainee priest! I've been
to mass once in 15 years.

16:46.960 --> 16:49.990
Perhaps it does require
a certain leap of faith.

16:50.040 --> 16:52.910
~ The man is practically a heathen!
~ There's no need for that.

16:52.960 --> 16:56.390
~ For once I agree with Mrs M.
~ He'd need to remember his catechism.

16:56.440 --> 16:58.990
~ Mass prayers.
~ And the order of responses.

16:59.040 --> 17:01.350
I could think of one now, if
I weren't in polite company.

17:01.400 --> 17:07.030
A priest has to carry himself with a
certain manner, modest and dignified.

17:07.079 --> 17:11.390
~ And as for a vow of celibacy...
~ I'd need help, of course.

17:11.440 --> 17:12.910
I know my basic tenets.

17:12.960 --> 17:16.160
Even if you don't always act on them.

17:17.280 --> 17:20.589
~ Perhaps it's a bad idea.
~ Not your finest hour, Father.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.190
Given the material
we have to work with.

17:23.240 --> 17:26.069
The good Lord himself would be
put to the pin of his collar.

17:26.119 --> 17:29.390
You don't think I can do it.

17:29.440 --> 17:31.550
We'll have to leave it
to the Kembleford police.

17:31.600 --> 17:33.870
No, Sid Carter never
ducks a challenge.

17:33.920 --> 17:37.430
~ Five shillings says I can pull it off.
~ Bravo!
~ Done.

17:37.480 --> 17:40.980
A few Hail Marys, how hard
can it be? Oh, hello?

17:43.160 --> 17:45.560
The four cardinal virtues...

17:46.000 --> 17:51.280
Prudence, justice, temperance and...

17:52.400 --> 17:54.270
Don't tell me...

17:54.320 --> 17:55.950
gratitude.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.830
~ Fortitude.
~ That's what I said.

17:57.880 --> 18:00.350
I'd better offer up a
prayer to Saint Jude,

18:00.400 --> 18:02.550
patron saint of lost causes.

18:02.600 --> 18:05.900
Right, you can take that
off and I'll sew it.

18:26.760 --> 18:30.440
Your ministry placement...
must be a formality.

18:31.560 --> 18:34.670
It's awaiting the bishop's approval.

18:34.720 --> 18:37.910
I still haven't lined
up a suitable parish.

18:37.960 --> 18:40.350
I thought you could
put in a word for me?

18:40.400 --> 18:45.480
Now that Potts is gone,
we need to stick together.

18:46.960 --> 18:49.150
This time next month,
I'll be ordained.

18:49.200 --> 18:52.680
~ We go our separate ways.
~ And what about our pledge?

18:53.920 --> 18:56.260
I'll be making vows to God.

18:58.200 --> 19:02.350
One word from me and
I could ruin you,

19:02.400 --> 19:05.470
destroy this temple and
everything it stands for.

19:05.520 --> 19:08.350
And where would you
be without the Church?

19:08.400 --> 19:11.310
Back in the gutter
where you came from.

19:11.360 --> 19:15.150
~ You could take me with you.
~ You'd only hold me back.

19:15.200 --> 19:17.740
Is that what you said to Potts?

19:18.480 --> 19:21.880
~ You seriously think I pushed him?
~ You tell me.

19:22.640 --> 19:25.110
And where were you
exactly when he fell?

19:25.160 --> 19:30.160
Prayers in the chapel. We
went in together. Remember?

19:36.960 --> 19:38.310
I'll speak to Father Lewis.

19:38.360 --> 19:40.230
See what I can do.

19:41.880 --> 19:43.880
I'd appreciate that.

20:00.480 --> 20:02.070
Sidney Carter. Diocese of Southwark.

20:02.120 --> 20:03.950
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.750
He sounds like a door-to-door salesman.

20:05.800 --> 20:07.790
And as for that hand-me-down cassock...

20:07.840 --> 20:11.470
It was the best I could do
under trying circumstances.

20:11.520 --> 20:14.230
The Father has filled out
a little in recent years.

20:14.280 --> 20:16.190
I'm never going to pull this off.

20:16.240 --> 20:19.680
Don't slouch, Sidney, it
really isn't priestly.

20:22.240 --> 20:23.750
Good. You're all here.

20:23.800 --> 20:25.910
I trust your rounds were
fortuitously blessed?

20:25.960 --> 20:29.280
You don't think the
glasses are too much?

20:30.400 --> 20:33.200
I think they make him look cerebral.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.590
I've spoken to Father Palfreyman.

20:36.640 --> 20:40.270
He's expecting his
new arrival tonight.

20:40.320 --> 20:43.520
~ Heaven help us all!
~ It will take a miracle.

20:44.600 --> 20:49.150
God, our Father, please
send us holy priests

20:49.200 --> 20:52.270
all for the sacred and
Eucharistic Heart of Jesus

20:52.320 --> 20:55.270
all for the sorrowful and
Immaculate Heart of Mary

20:55.320 --> 20:58.350
in union with Saint Joseph.

20:58.400 --> 21:01.920
~ Amen.
~ Amen.

21:03.320 --> 21:06.600
By Jove, I think he's ready.

21:13.280 --> 21:15.920
Rise and shine.

21:19.720 --> 21:21.350
What time is it?

21:21.400 --> 21:23.140
Quarter to six.

21:23.440 --> 21:25.780
You'll get used to the bed.

21:28.200 --> 21:32.240
Like sleeping on a sack
of bleeding spuds.

21:35.240 --> 21:38.510
~ If you'll pardon my French.
~ This was Potts' room.

21:38.560 --> 21:41.760
~ The man who jumped off the roof?
~ You heard?

21:42.080 --> 21:46.110
Terrible business. God rest his soul.

21:46.160 --> 21:48.670
We called him Doubting Thomas.

21:48.720 --> 21:51.590
The rigours of a parish would
never have suited him.

21:51.640 --> 21:54.110
I'm Mr Risley, just next door.

21:56.440 --> 21:59.870
Sidney Carter, Diocese of Southwark.

21:59.920 --> 22:02.350
It's a pleasure to meet
your acquaintance.

22:02.400 --> 22:05.700
Better get dressed. I'll
show you the ropes.

22:10.440 --> 22:12.030
(I'm a priest.)

22:12.080 --> 22:14.790
Morning prayers and Adoration,
Lectio Divina.

22:14.840 --> 22:17.430
Then practical theology
with Father Lewis.

22:17.480 --> 22:20.350
~ Meditation, homiletics...
~ Do we ever get time off?

22:20.400 --> 22:23.950
Two hours a day for study groups.
Recreation after supper.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.070
I like to put mine to good use.
There's the allotment to tend to,

22:27.120 --> 22:29.390
kitchen duties, when
they need extra hands.

22:29.440 --> 22:33.430
~ You certainly like to keep busy.
~ My reward will be in Heaven.

22:33.480 --> 22:37.200
~ True enough.
~ Maybe you could volunteer?
Douglas used to help me.

22:38.840 --> 22:42.040
~ Douglas Hitchens?
~ Hitch and I were friends.

22:45.160 --> 22:48.750
~ So, this is the new boy?
~ I'm taking good care of him.

22:48.800 --> 22:51.070
Pipe down, Risley, you're
giving me earache.

22:51.120 --> 22:54.030
You could have timed
your arrival better.

22:54.080 --> 22:56.480
Yes, I heard about Mr Potts.

22:56.800 --> 23:00.950
We miss his communion. Upcott
won't be the same without him.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.350
He must have been tested
to end it all that way.

23:04.400 --> 23:07.470
~ You seem to know a lot about it.
~ Seminary gossip.

23:07.520 --> 23:09.950
Gossipers speak of the
failings of others,

23:10.000 --> 23:12.310
which is why the Church
sees it as a sin!

23:12.360 --> 23:14.230
Of course, Father.

23:16.000 --> 23:20.240
~ Mr Carter joins us from Allen Hall.
~ That's right.

23:22.080 --> 23:24.790
How's Father Pinkerton these days?

23:24.840 --> 23:27.180
Still a martyr to his gout?

23:28.880 --> 23:32.380
He certainly doesn't like
to suffer in silence.

23:32.840 --> 23:36.110
That certainly sounds
like Father Pinkerton.

23:36.160 --> 23:39.310
I see you've all met our
newcomer Mr Cartwright.

23:39.360 --> 23:42.870
Here upon my personal recommendation.

23:42.920 --> 23:46.000
Free from the flesh
pots of Londinium.

23:47.560 --> 23:49.950
I've left all that behind me, Father.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.630
Good to see you back
on your feet, Rector.

23:52.680 --> 23:55.920
Thank you for your concern,
Father. Shall we go in?

24:00.920 --> 24:06.470
New seminarians are always welcome.
Ciaran Wolfe. Welcome to Upcott.

24:06.520 --> 24:08.320
Glad to be here.

24:09.200 --> 24:13.120
If you want to fit in around here,
you'll learn to keep your head down.

24:15.240 --> 24:18.430
I'd keep well clear of Wolfe and
his cronies. They're bad news.

24:18.480 --> 24:20.870
Anyone would think they're
running the place.

24:20.920 --> 24:23.830
There'll be room in the choir
stalls if we're lucky.

24:23.880 --> 24:27.780
I've forgotten my prayer
book, I'll see you in there.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.430
I don't know how you coped,
Father. Cold showers.

25:22.480 --> 25:25.510
Morning, afternoon
and evening prayers.

25:25.560 --> 25:30.510
~ Lumpy porridge and lumpy beds.
~ It certainly brings back memories.

25:30.560 --> 25:31.910
It's worse than prison.

25:31.960 --> 25:33.150
Is it?

25:33.200 --> 25:37.470
You said there had been
some developments?

25:37.520 --> 25:42.030
Douglas Hitchens' prayer book.
I found it in Wolfe's room.

25:42.080 --> 25:44.310
That smacks of a man with
a guilty conscience.

25:44.360 --> 25:47.150
That's certainly worth investigating.

25:47.200 --> 25:49.400
What about Father Lewis?

25:51.080 --> 25:54.350
That man's stare could turn
milk. Runs a study group.

25:54.400 --> 25:55.590
Bit of a closed shop.

25:55.640 --> 25:59.230
Try and get closer to Mr
Wolfe. Gain his trust.

25:59.280 --> 26:00.830
That's easier said than done.

26:00.880 --> 26:04.270
I've got the college idiot
sticking to me like glue.

26:04.320 --> 26:06.030
Mr Risley.

26:06.080 --> 26:08.070
I feel a bit sorry
for him, to be honest.

26:08.120 --> 26:11.320
He's short of a friend
since Hitchens died.

26:13.680 --> 26:15.430
Father, I'd better get a wiggle on,

26:15.480 --> 26:19.510
I'll be late for that visit
to the Blessed Sacrament.

26:19.560 --> 26:23.510
We'll rendezvous tomorrow
at the college feast.

26:23.560 --> 26:27.640
Let's hope something comes up.
This collar's beginning to itch.

26:28.680 --> 26:32.790
~ You will be careful?
~ Are you worried about me, Father.

26:32.840 --> 26:35.640
Don't be, I've got this one covered.

26:37.400 --> 26:39.000
Hello again.

26:51.880 --> 26:54.750
~ You are so naughty.
~ So they tell me.

27:22.600 --> 27:25.200
Whoa! Risley.

27:26.240 --> 27:28.470
I missed you at vespers last night.

27:28.520 --> 27:31.070
I wasn't feeling too good. I
thought I'd better stay in bed.

27:31.120 --> 27:34.510
~ Perhaps it was something you ate?
~ Wouldn't surprise me in this place.

27:34.560 --> 27:37.190
When you get dressed, I'll
walk with you to the chapel.

27:37.240 --> 27:40.790
~ I think I can find my own way by now.
~ I thought we were friends?

27:40.840 --> 27:43.310
Well, maybe you jumped the gun.

27:43.360 --> 27:46.860
I welcomed you to Upcott
as a brother in Christ.

27:47.720 --> 27:51.030
Do you know something, Risley?
You're starting to creep me out.

27:51.080 --> 27:53.390
You'd rather spend time
with the fraternity boys.

27:53.440 --> 27:54.670
What fraternity?

27:54.720 --> 27:58.160
Mark my words. Nothing
good will come of it.

28:11.520 --> 28:14.790
Father Brown, what
a pleasant surprise!

28:14.840 --> 28:18.350
You invited me to the feast.

28:18.400 --> 28:20.870
Oh, yes, of course!

28:20.920 --> 28:23.350
It should be an impressive
display, Father.

28:23.400 --> 28:25.790
And I shall multiply
the fruit of the tree

28:25.840 --> 28:28.310
and the increase of the field.

28:28.360 --> 28:31.920
What more could we do to
celebrate the Assumption.

28:33.440 --> 28:37.800
You will, as my guest of honour,
be sitting next to me.

28:49.880 --> 28:55.630
~ I thought we'd seen the last of you.
~ Oh, I'm full of surprises...

28:55.680 --> 28:58.870
Good to see the lads
enjoying themselves.

28:58.920 --> 29:00.990
Some more than others.

29:02.120 --> 29:05.630
Young Carstairs is blending
in rather well.

29:05.680 --> 29:08.800
Let's hope he keeps his
mind on the task in hand.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.950
You'll like this one.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.710
A rabbi, a vicar and a
priest walk into a pub,

29:15.760 --> 29:18.070
the bartender looks them up and down,

29:18.120 --> 29:20.790
"What is this, some kind of joke?"

29:24.360 --> 29:26.750
Top us up, Grisley! This
jug's running dry.

29:26.800 --> 29:30.200
Come on, Grisley Risley.
The boys are thirsty.

29:35.080 --> 29:37.620
That's a lovely apron, Grisley.

29:43.760 --> 29:45.070
To Upcott!

29:45.120 --> 29:47.000
To Upcott!

29:49.760 --> 29:52.150
You've made yourself quite at home.

29:52.200 --> 29:55.360
~ Mr Carter's one of us now.
~ I wouldn't be too sure of that.

29:57.600 --> 30:01.270
I've been hearing whispers
about this...

30:01.320 --> 30:03.430
fraternity of yours.

30:03.480 --> 30:06.510
You should be careful
who you listen to.

30:06.560 --> 30:10.680
I'm just saying if ever you're
looking to replace Mr Potts...

30:12.760 --> 30:14.900
I'll bear that in mind.

30:16.400 --> 30:19.960
I checked with Allen Hall. They
said they'd never heard of you.

30:21.400 --> 30:23.510
Must have been a mistake.

30:23.560 --> 30:26.920
You're a poor excuse
for a priest, Mr Carter.

30:28.360 --> 30:31.030
All that beer's got to your head.

30:36.440 --> 30:37.670
Perhaps the blessing?

30:37.720 --> 30:39.470
The blessing!

30:42.280 --> 30:45.350
If I could have your attention?

30:45.400 --> 30:50.510
This will be my 25th feast
as Rector of Upcott.

30:58.320 --> 31:03.590
It seems like yesterday that
I arrived, a green academic,

31:03.640 --> 31:07.870
mindful of our illustrious history,

31:07.920 --> 31:13.920
dedicated to God and to the young
men he has chosen to guide here.

31:15.840 --> 31:19.400
Sadly Thomas Potts is not here today.

31:20.840 --> 31:27.870
The passing of one our own has
left us with serious questions,

31:27.920 --> 31:34.240
doubt, recrimination and
understandable sorrow.

31:35.800 --> 31:42.710
But on this magnificent feast
day, let us put aside our grief,

31:42.760 --> 31:48.680
and celebrate the powerful
redemption of faith.

31:51.120 --> 31:55.560
Join me, if you will, in
the blessing of the fruits.

31:59.120 --> 32:02.870
Our help is in the
name of the Lord...

32:04.520 --> 32:07.670
~ McKenna?
~ Help him!
~ Somebody fetch a doctor!

32:14.240 --> 32:15.270
Thready pulse.

32:15.320 --> 32:16.990
Deadly nightshade.

32:17.040 --> 32:19.240
Infirmary.

32:22.840 --> 32:23.910
How's he doing?

32:23.960 --> 32:27.550
He's stable. Thanks to prompt
action by the rector.

32:27.600 --> 32:30.390
These crosses they're wearing,
it's a secret fraternity.

32:30.440 --> 32:32.070
Risley warned me off.

32:32.120 --> 32:34.590
A fraternity hand-picked,
no doubt, by Lewis.

32:34.640 --> 32:35.910
I've called the police.

32:35.960 --> 32:37.950
Make yourself scarce...

32:38.000 --> 32:39.430
Gosh, they were jolly quick.

32:39.480 --> 32:41.680
I'll keep tabs on Wolfe.

32:45.800 --> 32:49.110
McKenna's in the infirmary,
the antidote worked.

32:49.160 --> 32:52.870
~ McKenna?
~ The seminary doctor's with him now.

32:52.920 --> 32:55.910
I'm here in connection with
the death of Thomas Potts.

32:55.960 --> 32:59.430
You said in your statement, you
prescribed him a herbal remedy.

32:59.480 --> 33:01.790
A dilution of feverfew
for his headaches.

33:01.840 --> 33:04.070
The body of the deceased
was found to contain

33:04.120 --> 33:07.070
traces of a powerful
hallucinogenic drug.

33:07.120 --> 33:09.430
You're not suggesting that
the rector is culpable?

33:09.480 --> 33:12.600
~ I'm suggesting it's a possibility.
~ I don't think so!

33:13.800 --> 33:17.150
~ Find the infirmary, check on this McKenna.
~ Sir.

33:17.200 --> 33:20.470
~ I need to ask you some questions.
~ You've got the wrong man.

33:20.520 --> 33:23.590
We can do this in your study
or down at the station.

33:23.640 --> 33:26.440
Please, come to my study. Follow me.

33:28.040 --> 33:30.110
Heaven knows why I sponsored you.

33:30.160 --> 33:32.390
All you've ever given me is trouble.

33:32.440 --> 33:35.430
You think I had something
to do with this?

33:35.480 --> 33:38.150
I know what you're capable of.

33:38.200 --> 33:39.950
I made ONE mistake.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.400
You have sinned against God.

33:42.920 --> 33:46.110
And I have sinned for
hiding what you did.

33:46.160 --> 33:51.790
If this gets out, I'll lose
my placement, the parish,

33:51.840 --> 33:54.240
everything we've worked for.

33:54.680 --> 33:57.840
You really think you
are fit to be a priest?

34:08.719 --> 34:10.909
You fraternity boys are
dropping like flies.

34:10.960 --> 34:13.429
Maybe I'll pass on the membership.

34:13.480 --> 34:15.310
I don't think you've
got what it takes.

34:15.360 --> 34:18.230
Badge of honour, the oath
of allegiance, come on.

34:18.280 --> 34:21.830
Even Inspector Sullivan will
make the connection in the end.

34:21.880 --> 34:24.550
The police have got nothing on me.

34:24.600 --> 34:26.909
Maybe they'll perk up a
bit when they find that

34:26.960 --> 34:28.550
prayer book of yours.

34:28.600 --> 34:30.750
That's to say if it's
still in your room.

34:30.800 --> 34:33.830
~ You devious little sneak.
~ You killed Douglas Hitchens.

34:33.880 --> 34:36.790
~ I didn't kill anyone.
~ You hounded Potts to the
top of the bell tower...

34:36.840 --> 34:40.350
~ Potts jumped.
~ You poisoned McKenna,
all to save your own skin.

34:40.400 --> 34:44.199
I think it's time you
confessed, Mr Wolfe.

34:56.639 --> 35:00.270
They're searching my study for
evidence. Not even a warrant!

35:00.320 --> 35:01.710
Deadly nightshade.

35:01.760 --> 35:05.310
~ Anti inflammatory in small doses.
~ Seer's sage...

35:05.360 --> 35:08.230
Analgesic, induces mild euphoria.

35:08.280 --> 35:11.190
Could be hallucinogenic
in larger amounts.

35:11.240 --> 35:13.270
Unpleasant memories,
recurring nightmares.

35:13.320 --> 35:14.710
A frightening loss of control.

35:14.760 --> 35:15.910
Mr Potts.

35:15.960 --> 35:19.590
Someone replaced blackcurrants
with belladonna,

35:19.640 --> 35:23.670
and swapped feverfew flowers
for psychedelic leaves.

35:23.720 --> 35:27.760
~ Someone who worked in this garden.
~ We need to find Mr Risley.

35:30.360 --> 35:33.390
~ Risley. Wolfe? Have you seen him?
~ Not since the feast.

35:33.440 --> 35:36.310
I think he murdered Douglas Hitchens.

35:41.640 --> 35:44.110
The vestibule needed cleaning.

35:59.080 --> 36:02.920
~ It was you?
~ He needed to pay, they all did.

36:07.720 --> 36:09.310
This man needs an ambulance.

36:09.360 --> 36:11.430
I can't let you do that,

36:11.480 --> 36:13.560
they'll lock me away.

36:22.560 --> 36:26.270
~ Was Mr Risley in Italy?
~ I suppose he must have been.

36:26.320 --> 36:28.550
Overlooked, as always.

36:28.600 --> 36:31.350
For a man of such physical
presence, he's easily missed.

36:31.400 --> 36:33.240
Blood.

36:35.200 --> 36:38.950
He wears a cilice, a metal
chain around his leg.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.950
When it cuts him, he bleeds.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.880
Self mortification, I do not condone!

36:45.000 --> 36:48.000
Suffering for God. He's
never felt good enough.

36:49.680 --> 36:52.590
But why hold a grudge
against his fellows?

36:52.640 --> 36:57.000
Revenge. They covered up the
death of his only friend.

37:00.080 --> 37:03.180
Would you please fetch
Inspector Sullivan.

37:08.120 --> 37:10.630
I see the top of this tower
as a foretaste of Heaven.

37:10.680 --> 37:13.150
It often leaves me breathless.

37:15.160 --> 37:17.510
I've got no quarrel with you, Risley.

37:17.560 --> 37:21.310
~ You laughed at me at the feast.
~ Wolfe will get what's coming to him.

37:21.360 --> 37:24.430
He got away with murder.
He killed Douglas.

37:24.480 --> 37:26.910
Now he knows how it feels
to lose his friends.

37:26.960 --> 37:28.990
~ Sid?
~ Up here!

37:29.040 --> 37:33.390
~ Keep away! I'm warning you.
~ This won't bring Douglas back.

37:33.440 --> 37:37.270
The priesthood was his calling.
They took that away from him.

37:37.320 --> 37:39.510
You can still makes things right.

37:39.560 --> 37:43.230
Tell the police what you
saw, that night at the lake.

37:43.280 --> 37:47.480
~ No-one ever listens to me.
~ I'm listening to you, Mr Risley.

37:49.280 --> 37:53.910
They argued, the fraternity brothers,

37:53.960 --> 37:56.790
a trivial point of theology.

37:56.840 --> 38:00.670
Wolfe lost his temper, lashed out.

38:00.720 --> 38:03.950
Douglas fell in. It was dark.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.230
A long way down.

38:05.280 --> 38:07.040
<Argh!

38:13.440 --> 38:15.180
~ Go.
~ I'm going.

38:20.400 --> 38:23.110
No-one was sorry.
No-one was to blame.

38:23.160 --> 38:26.120
How did that make them better men?

38:28.320 --> 38:31.110
Mr Potts was sorry.

38:31.160 --> 38:34.270
You heard him in confession.

38:34.320 --> 38:38.830
The seer's sage made him talk.

38:38.880 --> 38:42.830
But even on the roof, he mocked me.

38:42.880 --> 38:46.040
Risley, you scared me half
to death, you imbecile.

38:49.120 --> 38:50.830
Whaaa...

38:57.160 --> 38:59.630
I had to do it. Don't you see?

39:00.360 --> 39:03.830
Without the shedding of blood,
there can be no remission.

39:03.880 --> 39:09.910
Murder, Mr Risley, is not the
shedding of blood for remission.

39:09.960 --> 39:11.800
Father Brown?

39:15.200 --> 39:17.070
Enough!

39:17.120 --> 39:20.360
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

39:37.240 --> 39:39.230
I'm writing to the bishop,

39:39.280 --> 39:41.270
the rector's a liability.

39:41.320 --> 39:43.860
Time they put him out to grass.

39:44.680 --> 39:51.320
They've arrested Mr Risley for
crimes against your fraternity.

39:53.800 --> 39:56.950
~ And Mr Wolfe?
~ They'll patch him up.

39:57.000 --> 40:00.760
Then charge him in connection with
the death of Douglas Hitchens.

40:05.760 --> 40:10.120
I founded the fraternity
to make them better men.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.880
Two of your charges are dead.

40:17.320 --> 40:21.550
Your pastoral care has
been somewhat remiss.

40:21.600 --> 40:23.870
They came to me for help.

40:25.480 --> 40:28.390
Would you have condemned them?

40:28.440 --> 40:30.270
Ruined more lives?

40:30.320 --> 40:31.990
I don't know.

40:33.480 --> 40:36.870
Ordination changes souls,

40:36.920 --> 40:38.460
purges sin.

40:41.080 --> 40:43.150
I wanted to save them.

40:44.480 --> 40:46.350
Well, you failed.

40:58.280 --> 41:00.910
Sid Carter? I'm taking you in.

41:00.960 --> 41:02.470
On what grounds?

41:02.520 --> 41:05.070
~ Impersonating a priest.
~ That's not even a crime!

41:05.120 --> 41:08.910
Fraud, deception, breach of the peace,
I'm sure I can think of more.

41:08.960 --> 41:11.990
~ It was all my idea.
~ I'm only too aware of that.

41:12.040 --> 41:13.150
This is harassment!

41:13.200 --> 41:15.390
Don't worry, Sid, we'll
soon have you out.

41:15.440 --> 41:18.510
I'm not getting in
there, not with him.

41:18.560 --> 41:21.860
I don't suppose there's
any chance of a lift?

41:25.480 --> 41:27.440
(No, thought not.)

41:34.080 --> 41:40.670
I've tendered my resignation with
the bishop. Effective forthwith.

41:40.720 --> 41:44.390
Upcott needs a man with more vigour.

41:44.440 --> 41:47.040
They'll have their work cut out.

41:48.960 --> 41:53.510
Truth is I've been becoming
rather forgetful.

41:53.560 --> 41:59.470
~ Really?
~ They're sending an interim
rector from Aberystwyth.

41:59.520 --> 42:01.320
Oh...

42:02.520 --> 42:07.510
~ Where will you go?
~ The Christian Brothers
said they'd take me in.

42:07.560 --> 42:11.600
I'll spend the rest of my
days in quiet contemplation.

42:13.920 --> 42:16.430
Upcott won't be the same without you.

42:16.480 --> 42:20.960
And I won't be the same without
Upcott. You will visit?

42:22.120 --> 42:23.230
Try and keep me away.

42:23.280 --> 42:27.550
I shall need butter, soap,

42:27.600 --> 42:29.910
fortuitous racing tips.

42:29.960 --> 42:32.110
Hm...

42:32.160 --> 42:35.720
If you open the bottle,
we'll drink to the future.

42:45.800 --> 42:47.310
Four hours in a police cell.

42:47.360 --> 42:49.950
They have not heard the last of this.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.630
At least he didn't charge you.

42:51.680 --> 42:53.430
I cannot wait to get
out of this cassock.

42:53.480 --> 42:55.630
I don't know how you ride
a bike in these things.

42:55.680 --> 42:57.950
For the collection, Father.

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
Most generous of you,
madam. Go with God.

43:05.400 --> 43:08.990
Red Lion. She's buyin'.
Things are looking up.

43:09.040 --> 43:12.710
~ And there was I hoping
for a Damascene conversion.
~ You'd be lucky!

43:12.760 --> 43:16.550
~ That belongs to the church, Sidney!
~ I won't tell if you won't!

43:16.600 --> 43:19.830
It's for leaky roofs and orphans!

43:19.880 --> 43:22.880
~ Sidney! That is ten shillings!
~ I know!
