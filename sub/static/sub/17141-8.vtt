[clears throat]

00:06.381 --> 00:07.382
[sniffs]

00:08.383 --> 00:09.843
Hey, guys.
It's me, Miranda.

00:09.927 --> 00:11.595
So, for today, I'm gonna teach you

00:11.679 --> 00:14.014
how to keep your feet warm
while you're wearing sandals.

00:14.097 --> 00:15.599
I know, everyone's dying to know.

00:15.683 --> 00:18.143
So, you want to know the secret?

00:18.226 --> 00:19.687
Ta-da!

00:19.770 --> 00:21.939
So, for this tutorial
all you're gonna need

00:22.022 --> 00:25.358
is some sandals
and, of course... some socks.

00:25.442 --> 00:28.195
So, first thing you're gonna do
is take the sock, you--

00:28.278 --> 00:30.280
-[Jim] Cut!
-What?

00:30.363 --> 00:31.990
This is missing something.

00:32.073 --> 00:33.659
I... I can't quite put my finger on it.

00:33.742 --> 00:36.119
Okay, well, you didn't let me get
to the part where I put

00:36.203 --> 00:38.706
my thong inside the toe crease.
Let me show you.

00:38.789 --> 00:40.916
I know, I know, but it just doesn't
have the same pizzazz

00:40.999 --> 00:43.376
as, like, the <i>Free Voice Lesson</i> video.

00:43.460 --> 00:45.879
-I'm pretty sure that would be huge--
-No, okay?

00:45.963 --> 00:47.756
That video gives away
all my singing secrets.

00:47.840 --> 00:48.841
Don't post it.

00:48.924 --> 00:52.636
It's just that... you were just
the grand marshal of the parade!

00:52.720 --> 00:54.888
And when you're on top,
you have a long way to fall.

00:54.972 --> 00:59.768
One teensy mistake could send you
crashing down from your fame throne.

00:59.852 --> 01:03.814
That's why this next video we post...
has got to be the best!

01:03.897 --> 01:06.567
Yeah, you're right.
What ideas do you have?

01:06.650 --> 01:07.735
[gasps]

01:07.818 --> 01:12.197
What about a no-charge singing tutorial?

01:12.280 --> 01:14.366
Hmm.

01:14.449 --> 01:17.410
-Wait! That's the same freakin' thing!
-[sputters]

01:17.494 --> 01:20.664
What about a no money up-front...

01:21.999 --> 01:24.710
melodic yelling experience video?

01:24.793 --> 01:26.795
What does "melodic" mean?

01:26.879 --> 01:29.006
-Singing.
-No! That's the same thing again!

01:29.089 --> 01:30.298
[sighs]

01:30.382 --> 01:31.842
Think of something else.

01:32.592 --> 01:34.344
Just think about it, Miranda!

01:34.427 --> 01:35.595

01:46.899 --> 01:48.609
Oh, well, hello.

01:48.692 --> 01:51.111
Did you have something
you wanted to say to me?

01:52.570 --> 01:55.949
I'm just saying, it's probably pretty good
that I fixed those paintings for you.

01:58.535 --> 02:01.413
You know, usually when someone helps you
get into art school

02:01.496 --> 02:03.165
you're supposed to say, "Thank you."

02:08.211 --> 02:10.631
Hello? Earth to Emily!

02:10.714 --> 02:14.176
I didn't get into the art school... okay?

02:15.177 --> 02:16.261
What?

02:17.554 --> 02:20.140
But I spent almost an hour
fixing those paintings.

02:21.934 --> 02:23.769
[inhales] Fixing them?

02:26.021 --> 02:29.107
You ruined them.

02:29.191 --> 02:33.904
Emily... Did you not see
all the glitter and the macaroni?

02:35.238 --> 02:37.282
Those paintings looked way better
after I got to them.

02:37.365 --> 02:38.408
I was helping you.

02:38.491 --> 02:42.620
I put everything into those paintings
and you destroyed them, Miranda.

02:42.705 --> 02:43.997
All of them.

02:47.835 --> 02:48.961
[faintly] I'm sorry.

02:49.044 --> 02:52.005
Are you sorry?
Really?

02:52.089 --> 02:56.218
Or are you just so dumb
that you thought you were helping me?

03:09.940 --> 03:11.942
[theme music playing]

03:45.183 --> 03:46.935
Oh, is this for me?

03:47.019 --> 03:48.228
Correct.

03:50.105 --> 03:51.564
I like your bow tie.

03:51.648 --> 03:53.608
Oh, thank you.

03:53.691 --> 03:56.069
I had a matching hat for it,
but I lost it.

03:56.153 --> 03:57.154
Oh.

03:59.990 --> 04:03.035
What the heck is this?
Where's my Froze Toes?

04:03.118 --> 04:06.413
Uh, well, this is a Froze Rose.

04:06.496 --> 04:08.999
I made it for you.
It took a long time.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.918
Okay, well, Patrick,
you know my regular order.

04:11.001 --> 04:12.669
One Froze Toes, please.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.882
So, I'm really looking forward
to our date this evening.

04:17.966 --> 04:20.135
[inhales deeply] You should be.

04:20.218 --> 04:22.262
I'm still working out
some of the details.

04:22.345 --> 04:23.430
Uh...

04:23.513 --> 04:25.182
Well, it better be really good. [scoffs]

04:26.599 --> 04:28.351
Mmm.

04:28.435 --> 04:29.895
The stakes are high, Patrick.

04:31.313 --> 04:35.275
I'm famous now, so...
I could be dating anyone I want.

04:35.358 --> 04:38.653
Plus... [sniffles]
I'm a lady.

04:38.736 --> 04:40.488
-[slurping]
-Oh, I know.

04:40.572 --> 04:42.950
So you better do something
really romantic,

04:43.575 --> 04:46.078
like taking me to a fancy restaurant or...

04:46.161 --> 04:47.745
renting a bouncy house.

04:47.830 --> 04:49.206
[softly] A restaurant.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.917
-[mutters]
-[vehicle approaching]

05:12.687 --> 05:15.983
Hey, I know you from church.
You're Amanda, right?

05:16.066 --> 05:17.818
[scoffs] He still doesn't even
know your name.

05:17.901 --> 05:19.027
How offensive.

05:19.111 --> 05:20.320
[Owen] And you're Patrick.

05:21.404 --> 05:22.530
He remembered.

05:23.656 --> 05:26.952
-Let me get one of those popsicles, Patty.
-Oh! You can have this one.

05:27.744 --> 05:30.747
I didn't even lick it yet. Unless...

05:30.831 --> 05:32.124
Did you want me to?

05:32.207 --> 05:35.752
Oh! Thanks, Amanda.
Saves me a buck, right?

05:35.836 --> 05:37.379
[chuckles]

05:39.256 --> 05:40.924
[Owen] Oh, yeah.

05:42.092 --> 05:44.677
Purity loves cold treats.

05:50.517 --> 05:51.768
Hey, Owen...

05:53.103 --> 05:54.229
Wanna pop my bubble?

06:00.235 --> 06:01.444
Uh...

06:03.947 --> 06:07.200
Patrick! How could you?
That bubble was for Owen.

06:07.284 --> 06:09.577
Don't worry,
I'll blow you a new one.

06:09.661 --> 06:12.372
[chuckling] Okay, you two.
I gotta get goin'.

06:12.455 --> 06:13.706
But where you going?

06:14.582 --> 06:15.583
I got a thing.

06:15.667 --> 06:17.794
A thing?
Mmm, I love things.

06:17.877 --> 06:18.878
What is it?

06:18.962 --> 06:21.673
It's a sound check
for my CD release party.

06:21.756 --> 06:24.426
It's at the Thea, so...
it's a pretty big deal. [sniffs]

06:26.094 --> 06:28.513
It's tonight
if you guys wanna come.

06:29.264 --> 06:31.474
Oh, well, we're busy tonight.

06:31.558 --> 06:32.850
Cool. It's fine.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.312
[engine starting]

06:35.395 --> 06:36.813
See you around, Amanda.

06:46.323 --> 06:48.283
[Miranda] The Thea Foss Theater?

06:48.366 --> 06:50.077
What the heck?

06:54.664 --> 06:56.750
-[chuckles]
-[door opens]

06:57.834 --> 06:59.752
-[door slams shut]
-Uncle Jim!

07:07.427 --> 07:10.763
Oh! Mr. Uncle, can I ask you a question
real quick before Miranda comes back?

07:10.847 --> 07:12.557
Shh!
[whispering] Get down here and hide!

07:12.640 --> 07:14.101
Here, we need to hide!

07:14.851 --> 07:17.938
Hide, Patrick, hide.
Hurry! Hurry.

07:18.021 --> 07:21.816
[gasps] Hide! Quick! Quick! Quick! Quick!
Quick! Quick! Quick! Quick! Quick!

07:21.899 --> 07:25.946
Whoa! Well, I'm trying to shoot
a viral video with Miranda.

07:26.029 --> 07:28.865
Now, if she sees us, the prank won't work.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.284
[Patrick] Well, uh,
can I ask your advice on something?

07:31.368 --> 07:32.953
How many times
do I have to tell you, Patrick?

07:33.036 --> 07:36.164
There's no one more qualified
to give advice than Uncle Jim.

07:36.248 --> 07:37.624
[chuckles] Yeah, of course.

07:37.707 --> 07:42.420
Uh, well, you see, Miranda finally agreed
to go on a date with me.

07:42.504 --> 07:45.923
Uh, and my primary objective
is to make sure that she's happy.

07:46.008 --> 07:49.761
So do you have any advice
on some activities that she might enjoy?

07:49.844 --> 07:51.721
Daddy saddle.

07:51.804 --> 07:54.224
-Excuse me?
-Daddy saddle.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.475
Ever since she was little,

07:55.558 --> 07:58.436
the happiest I've ever seen her
is on the daddy saddle.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.438
[chuckles]
Well, I... [clears throat]

08:00.522 --> 08:03.566
I don't think it'd be appropriate
for Miranda to ride on me.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.735
Why wouldn't it be appropriate
for her to ride on you?

08:05.818 --> 08:07.112
We're not related.

08:08.821 --> 08:10.157
Okay.

08:10.240 --> 08:14.161
And then, next, she says that
she wants a bounce house.

08:14.244 --> 08:16.663
-Of course she does.
-[stuttering] Yeah, and it's like,

08:16.746 --> 08:19.457
what kind of bounce house
do you get a girl?

08:19.541 --> 08:22.877
Like, if I got her the dinosaur one,
would that send the wrong message?

08:22.960 --> 08:24.962
-Yes.
-[Miranda] Uncle Jim! Uncle Jim!

08:25.047 --> 08:26.173
Uncle Jim!

08:26.881 --> 08:28.008
[Jim] Oh, shoot!

08:30.343 --> 08:31.469
What is this?

08:31.553 --> 08:32.636
[Jim sighs]

08:32.720 --> 08:33.929
How come I don't have a show here?

08:34.014 --> 08:35.682
Uh, we... we can get you a show
anywhere you want.

08:36.515 --> 08:39.061
You told me that the Thea Foss Theater
was impossible to get into.

08:39.144 --> 08:41.188
It is.
It only books famous people.

08:41.270 --> 08:43.273
-What?
-Oh! I mean, uh,

08:43.356 --> 08:45.067
famous in the traditional sense.

08:45.150 --> 08:47.152
Not pop or Internet celebrities.

08:47.235 --> 08:48.820
It's very close-minded of them.

08:49.571 --> 08:52.449
Excuse me?
I am famous.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.452
I already did all your
Five Phases of Fame, plus a parade!

08:55.535 --> 08:58.371
I should be enjoying
a life of fame and luxury right now,

08:58.455 --> 09:01.124
but instead, you keep trying to make me
go back to phase one.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.542
[sighs]

09:04.586 --> 09:06.546
You're right. I'm sorry. I'll...

09:06.629 --> 09:08.631
I'll get you a night
at that place, Miranda.

09:09.966 --> 09:10.967
Thank you.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.971
-[grunts]
-[Patrick and Jim gasp]

09:19.016 --> 09:20.477
[sighs] Missed it.

09:35.783 --> 09:36.784
[sighs]

09:41.248 --> 09:42.874
Emily.

09:42.957 --> 09:46.711
I'm sorry I don't know
what to say sometimes.

09:46.794 --> 09:49.381
But the truth is, you're very strong.

09:49.464 --> 09:53.260
And... I do need to tell you something.
I need to tell you...

09:56.346 --> 09:59.557
-I have this syndrome--
-[scoffs] Mom, please, okay?

09:59.641 --> 10:02.477
I don't want to hear
about your imaginary ailments anymore.

10:02.560 --> 10:03.645
What?

10:06.273 --> 10:07.482
Are you going somewhere?

10:09.192 --> 10:12.279
-[sighs] I'm moving in with Dad.
-What?

10:12.362 --> 10:14.572
Why are you still talking to your father?

10:14.656 --> 10:17.033
Because I want to move in with him,
and he said yes.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.161
But you... you don't know
what he's really like!

10:19.244 --> 10:21.496
I know that he's different
than everyone else here.

10:23.498 --> 10:26.501
Well, what about us?
We need you.

10:26.584 --> 10:27.627
Mom!

10:28.753 --> 10:32.089
I cannot keep cleaning up
your messes, okay?

10:32.174 --> 10:34.091
I don't want to live in constant fear

10:34.176 --> 10:37.512
that someone's gonna glue macaroni
to every single thing that I do.

10:48.356 --> 10:49.816
-[Bethany sighs]
-[watch beeping]

11:07.292 --> 11:08.918
[sighs]

11:23.933 --> 11:26.060
-Can I help you?
-Yes, hi. I'm Miranda.

11:26.143 --> 11:28.605
My manager just called you
about booking a gig here for me?

11:28.688 --> 11:30.232
Uh, you mean your uncle.

11:30.315 --> 11:32.066
Yeah, I told him that wasn't gonna happen.

11:32.149 --> 11:34.694
-What the heck?
-Hey!

11:34.777 --> 11:37.489
Oh! Hey, Owen.
[laughs nervously]

11:37.572 --> 11:38.823
Thank God you're here.

11:38.906 --> 11:41.534
I'm trying to book a show here,
but this lady's being really annoying.

11:41.618 --> 11:44.662
Claire?
No, no, Claire's the best.

11:44.746 --> 11:46.664
She sold out my show
in, like, three hours.

11:46.748 --> 11:48.082
Well, [chuckles]
it wasn't very hard.

11:48.165 --> 11:49.584
-You're so talented.
-[Owen chuckles]

11:49.667 --> 11:52.295
I think you're more talented
than she thinks, so...

11:52.379 --> 11:54.005
Aw, thanks, hon.

11:55.340 --> 11:57.800
-Hon?
-You know this person?

11:57.884 --> 11:59.511
[chuckles]
Amanda? Yes.

11:59.594 --> 12:01.554
It's pretty hard to forget Amanda.

12:01.638 --> 12:03.723
-Stop it.
-[both chuckle]

12:03.806 --> 12:05.808
You should tell her how good I am
so she'll give me a show.

12:06.684 --> 12:09.937
[stutters] Uh, I did see her perform
at a funeral the other day

12:10.021 --> 12:12.106
and she...
she really shocked people.

12:12.189 --> 12:14.150
It was... It was pretty epic.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.778
[sighs] Yeah, I made people cry.

12:16.861 --> 12:18.446
-[chuckles]
-I bet you did.

12:18.530 --> 12:21.449
Wait. I have an idea.

12:22.367 --> 12:25.077
I have this really big announcement
tonight at the end of my show

12:25.161 --> 12:27.872
and it could use something epic
and you would be perfect.

12:28.998 --> 12:31.918
Oh, well, first of all, thank you
for recognizing that I'm perfect.

12:32.001 --> 12:34.253
And, secondly...
I'd love to do it.

12:34.337 --> 12:36.714
So, you come on and perform.

12:36.798 --> 12:38.591
Get people laughing and then...

12:38.675 --> 12:40.843
Boom!
I'll come out with my big surprise.

12:40.927 --> 12:41.928
Laughing?

12:42.011 --> 12:46.223
Don't you mean caressing everyone's ears
with my tantalizing sweet voice?

12:46.308 --> 12:47.642
-You see what I mean?
-[both chuckle]

12:47.725 --> 12:50.102
She's awesome!
So, can you do it?

12:50.186 --> 12:51.646
You have to.
It'd be perfect.

12:53.105 --> 12:56.318
I mean, this is all happening
so fast, Owen! [chuckling]

12:56.401 --> 12:59.612
Um, obviously, I'm gonna do it
because of our connection.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.198
Um, I know a really good love song?

13:03.366 --> 13:05.577
Yes. That would be amazing!

13:06.786 --> 13:09.831
-I'll see you later.
-Okay. [chuckles]

13:09.914 --> 13:11.708
I'll see you later.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.793
I'll see you so goodly.

13:13.876 --> 13:15.878
[stammering] Okay.

13:17.213 --> 13:18.715
See... see ya later.

13:23.678 --> 13:25.054
[exhales deeply]

13:25.137 --> 13:26.848
[whispering] Did you see the way
he looked at me?

13:26.931 --> 13:29.684
-[clears throat] Yeah.
-Oh, my gosh.

13:29.767 --> 13:31.436
[chuckles] I'm feeling tinglies.

13:34.939 --> 13:37.233
Hello, and welcome to our date.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.950
Hello... and welcome to our date.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.376
[groans]

13:55.502 --> 13:56.711
-[echoing] Mom.
-Yes?

13:56.794 --> 13:58.921
I'm performing
at the Thea Foss Theater tonight.

14:00.423 --> 14:01.633
Great.

14:02.550 --> 14:04.051
[echoing] Did you hear what I said?

14:04.135 --> 14:06.137
[normal] The Thea Foss Theater.

14:06.220 --> 14:08.390
It's sold out.
This is gonna be huge for my career.

14:09.516 --> 14:10.517
Yes.

14:10.600 --> 14:13.895
Um, have you seen my purse?

14:13.978 --> 14:16.063
What?
Why are you changing the subject?

14:16.147 --> 14:17.399
[gasps] There it is.

14:18.816 --> 14:20.777
You're gonna be there, right?

14:20.860 --> 14:22.028
[echoing] You bet.

14:23.446 --> 14:25.239
[echoing] Why are you
walking so weird today?

14:26.073 --> 14:27.283
[normal] Do you have foot warts again?

14:27.367 --> 14:29.494
Mom, I swear, if you walk around barefoot
and I catch it,

14:29.577 --> 14:30.953
I'm gonna be so ticked off at you!

14:32.955 --> 14:34.206
[exhales]

14:52.934 --> 14:54.226
Ooh, oh, Miranda!

14:54.310 --> 14:56.563
I called the theater
and they aren't budging.

14:56.646 --> 14:58.940
But guess what?
It gave me an incredible idea.

14:59.023 --> 15:00.316
We gotta go back to phase one.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.569
We gotta get you another viral video.

15:02.652 --> 15:04.987
But this time, it's got to be bigger!

15:05.071 --> 15:07.865
And that way, they'll be begging
to have you perform on that stage!

15:07.949 --> 15:09.283
Enough with the viral video!

15:09.366 --> 15:12.537
No, no, but listen.
I came up with an original song.

15:12.620 --> 15:15.247
It's sure to go viral.
It's called "Where My Baes At?"

15:16.207 --> 15:18.585
That's a horrible idea.
What the heck's a bae?

15:18.668 --> 15:19.669
Uh, I don't know exactly.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.421
Okay, if you don't like that,
how about this?

15:21.504 --> 15:25.425
We film you swimming
in a bathtub full of Slurpees.

15:25.508 --> 15:28.052
Ew, Uncle Jim.
It's not even summer.

15:28.135 --> 15:31.013
Okay, here's one I thought of last night.
A cinnamon challenge.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.724
You know what?
Let me stop you there.

15:32.807 --> 15:35.017
I went to that theater
and I got myself a gig.

15:35.101 --> 15:37.437
-You did? Without me?
-Yes, I did! I did!

15:37.520 --> 15:39.481
Yes, without you.
I got a gig tonight.

15:39.564 --> 15:42.484
So thanks for telling me
that it was impossible to get into.

15:42.567 --> 15:44.444
I thought it was impossible.

15:44.527 --> 15:46.779
Owen heard my voice
and that was all it took.

15:46.863 --> 15:50.867
He practically begged me to be
a part of his CD release concert tonight.

15:51.826 --> 15:52.994
What do you think about that?

15:53.077 --> 15:54.621
He thinks I'm perfect.

15:54.704 --> 15:56.831
He said that?

15:56.914 --> 15:58.708
He said that you were perfect?

15:58.791 --> 16:00.042
Yes.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.836
He sees the real me.

16:01.919 --> 16:05.381
You... you might be
misunderstanding him, Miranda.

16:06.257 --> 16:08.259
Are you serious, Emily? [scoffs]

16:08.342 --> 16:11.554
Sounds like someone's jealous
because I'm about to get all famous

16:11.638 --> 16:14.891
and all the agents and managers tonight
are gonna discover me

16:14.974 --> 16:17.935
and I'm gonna forget
all you little people.

16:18.019 --> 16:19.311
[stutters] Miranda.

16:19.395 --> 16:22.273
I actually think Emily might be right.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.568
Emily, why are you freaking everybody out?

16:25.652 --> 16:28.905
You're just mad
because all my dreams are coming true

16:28.988 --> 16:30.532
and I'm falling in love,

16:30.615 --> 16:32.659
and that dumb art school rejected you.

16:35.244 --> 16:36.412
[Emily scoffs]

16:38.372 --> 16:39.707
Bye, Miranda.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.293
Okay.

16:47.464 --> 16:48.591
Someone's grumpy.

16:48.675 --> 16:51.302
[chuckles] Did you see her
with that big old bag of books?

16:51.385 --> 16:54.055
-What a nerd!
-Nerd alert! [chuckles]

16:54.138 --> 16:56.473
-Book burn.
-Book burn.

16:57.642 --> 17:00.645
But, Miranda, I actually think this time,
Emily might have a point.

17:00.728 --> 17:03.731
I mean, you don't need
these record industry people!

17:03.815 --> 17:05.525
You have a secret weapon.

17:06.901 --> 17:09.529
His name is Uncle Jim.
Now let's focus on the viral video.

17:09.612 --> 17:10.946
No!

17:13.700 --> 17:15.034
Okay, you got it!

17:15.117 --> 17:16.953
I got it!
I'm... I'm on it!

17:17.036 --> 17:19.580
You just, uh,
worry about your performance tonight.

17:19.664 --> 17:21.165
[sighs heavily]

17:21.248 --> 17:23.250
I'll, uh, worry about the viral video.

17:26.127 --> 17:28.089
-[tuning guitar]
-[Miranda humming]

17:30.842 --> 17:32.384
Owen! [scoffs]

17:32.468 --> 17:34.637
I just did an incredible entrance
and you missed it!

17:34.721 --> 17:37.306
Can you please look up here?
I'll do it again.

17:39.100 --> 17:40.476
[April] Hey, you.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.019
Hey, April, what's up?

17:42.103 --> 17:43.730
-[chuckles] Are you excited?
-[Miranda humming]

17:43.813 --> 17:45.272
Owen!

17:45.356 --> 17:46.983
Oh, hi! [chuckles]

17:47.984 --> 17:50.695
-What are you guys talking about?
-Uh, um...

17:50.778 --> 17:53.781
I just wanted to say,
break a leg, baby. [chuckles]

17:53.865 --> 17:56.784
Thank you.
We both will, "baby."

17:57.952 --> 18:00.580
-Okay... [chuckling] Okay.
-I'll see you out there.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.332
[chuckling]

18:05.209 --> 18:09.756
Aw. You're so sweet,
being nice to the little fans.

18:10.882 --> 18:11.924
Yeah.

18:13.134 --> 18:14.802
All right.
Let me explain everything.

18:15.928 --> 18:19.807
So, your performance is gonna
catch everyone off guard.

18:20.683 --> 18:24.729
And the idea is,
they'll never be expecting a proposal.

18:24.812 --> 18:26.188
A proposal?

18:26.272 --> 18:29.692
Yeah, but that's the surprise, though.
So, shh, don't tell April.

18:29.776 --> 18:30.860
Why would I tell her?

18:30.943 --> 18:35.364
Just hand me this after you sing.

18:35.447 --> 18:37.533
But... no peeking.

18:38.618 --> 18:41.453
[chuckling] Oh, my gosh!
This is so unexpected!

18:41.537 --> 18:43.372
This is crazy! [chuckles]

18:43.455 --> 18:45.374
Okay. I'll see you out there.

18:45.457 --> 18:47.543
Great! It's a date!

18:50.755 --> 18:52.589
It's a date. A date.

18:54.466 --> 18:56.010
[phone vibrating]

18:59.346 --> 19:03.142
Hi, Miranda, uh, you're a little late,
is everything okay?

19:03.225 --> 19:05.269
Yeah.
A lot's happened today.

19:05.352 --> 19:06.854
My schedule got crazy.

19:06.938 --> 19:09.065
Oh, uh, well, that's, um...

19:10.316 --> 19:12.860
That's okay.
Uh, are you on your way now?

19:14.696 --> 19:16.072
I have to cancel.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.492
Oh. So...

19:21.828 --> 19:23.329
So you're not coming tonight, uh...

19:23.412 --> 19:24.789
Well, that's all right.

19:24.872 --> 19:28.500
<i>Uh, we'll...</i>
<i>We'll do it again soon.</i>

19:28.584 --> 19:32.880
Actually, it might take me a while to
save up for this particular plan again,

19:32.964 --> 19:34.298
but, you know, that's...

19:35.341 --> 19:36.676
That's fine.

19:37.677 --> 19:38.928
Patrick.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.431
I don't think things are gonna
work out between us.

19:45.392 --> 19:46.686
Uh...

19:47.979 --> 19:50.022
Why?
What... what changed?

19:51.398 --> 19:52.859
I'm with Owen now.

19:54.360 --> 19:55.361
What?

19:57.321 --> 20:00.199
Listen... I like you, Patrick.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.077
But I have to be smart about my love life.

20:03.911 --> 20:06.038
<i>No offense,</i>
<i>but I can't date a nobody.</i>

20:06.122 --> 20:08.082
<i>It wouldn't be good for my career.</i>

20:08.165 --> 20:10.001
<i>Besides, when I agreed to go out with you</i>

20:10.084 --> 20:13.129
<i>I had no idea that Owen was even</i>
<i>interested in me.</i>

20:13.212 --> 20:16.048
<i>I think you'll understand that</i>
<i>I have to see things through with him.</i>

20:16.673 --> 20:19.927
We're gonna be that celebrity couple
I always knew we could be.

20:22.013 --> 20:25.141
But... you and me can still be friends.

20:29.436 --> 20:30.646
No, Miranda...

20:31.814 --> 20:33.775
I don't think we can.

21:12.146 --> 21:14.106
[audience applauding]

21:16.859 --> 21:20.237
Guys, I want to thank you all
for coming out to my CD release party.

21:20.321 --> 21:23.115
I got a great lineup for y'all tonight.

21:23.199 --> 21:26.410
Uh, this next song goes out
to a very special person

21:26.493 --> 21:29.038
who's been with me
through thick and thin.

21:29.997 --> 21:32.666

-What are you doing here?
-I'm just checking in.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.164

Well, I guess, things, you know...

22:17.211 --> 22:20.047
I guess they don't always
work out like you thought.

22:20.131 --> 22:23.425
Good thing that I have
a backup plan already in effect.

22:23.509 --> 22:24.676
That's what I do as your manager.

22:24.760 --> 22:26.637
Sometimes I do things
you don't even ask for.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.430
What backup plan?

22:28.514 --> 22:31.142
[clears throat] Uh, just a little video
that I posted.

22:31.934 --> 22:32.977
What video?

22:33.060 --> 22:34.937
Well, [clears throat]
as your manager,

22:35.021 --> 22:36.188
I had to make
an executive decision.

22:36.272 --> 22:37.899
What video did you post?

22:38.607 --> 22:41.277
The <i>Free Voice Lesson</i> video
is going to do very well.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.694
Uncle Jim, I told you
not to post that video!

22:42.778 --> 22:44.363
Miranda, you left me no choice.

22:44.446 --> 22:45.948
-Why--
-You're fired.

22:47.074 --> 22:49.410
More like on fire,
because this decision is--

22:49.493 --> 22:51.245
I said you're fired!

22:52.746 --> 22:54.415
Miranda...

22:54.498 --> 22:58.544
You told me the only way to get famous
was through your dumb little phases.

22:58.627 --> 23:00.296
But you were so wrong.

23:00.379 --> 23:03.925
I had to do all the work, all by myself,
and look at me now.

23:04.008 --> 23:05.801
You have no idea what you're doing.

23:07.136 --> 23:08.887
I don't need you.

23:12.433 --> 23:14.435
But, Miranda, we're family.

23:15.561 --> 23:18.355
I don't need you.

23:24.820 --> 23:25.947
Okay.

[sighs]

23:38.167 --> 23:39.710
[audience applauding]

23:46.092 --> 23:48.594
Before we wrap it up tonight,

23:48.677 --> 23:53.432
I have one last surprise for you guys.

23:53.515 --> 23:58.395
Um, please give a very special welcome

Thank you, Owen.

24:11.408 --> 24:15.162
I have a very special song
prepared for you all this evening.

24:15.246 --> 24:19.041
I'd like to dedicate this song to Owen,

24:19.125 --> 24:20.584
because at the end of the day,

24:20.667 --> 24:23.712
all the sacrifices I have made
are worth it...

24:23.795 --> 24:25.672
because of the love that we share.

24:27.758 --> 24:30.886
This song is called,

That was so funny!

26:00.392 --> 26:03.645
Okay, you guys,
[stuttering] I'm sorry. That was...

26:03.729 --> 26:07.233
That was just a little joke that, uh,
Amanda and I wanted to play on you guys

26:07.316 --> 26:08.817
to throw you off a little bit, uh--

26:08.900 --> 26:10.569

26:10.652 --> 26:12.863
What I really want to do is, um...

26:14.573 --> 26:18.452
April, can you come on stage for a second?

Thank you.

26:25.876 --> 26:27.294
April...

26:28.504 --> 26:29.713
[sighs]

26:31.089 --> 26:32.966
-Will you marry me?
-[April gasps]

26:33.049 --> 26:34.676
-Yes!
-What?

26:34.760 --> 26:36.387
But you already asked me!

26:36.470 --> 26:38.430
[laughing]
Ah, good one!

26:38.514 --> 26:40.349
-[audience laughing]
-[Owen] She's so funny!

26:40.432 --> 26:43.059
-Okay, seriously, though. I need to...
-[April laughs]

26:43.144 --> 26:45.646
uh, I need to give the ring to...
to April now, so--

26:45.729 --> 26:47.981
-No, you gave it to me.
-Yeah, to hold.

26:48.064 --> 26:49.775
[audience laughing]

26:49.858 --> 26:51.902
[Miranda] This is just
a misunderstanding, everybody!

26:51.985 --> 26:53.654
He asked me backstage earlier!

26:53.737 --> 26:55.406
You're really committing
to the joke, right?

26:55.489 --> 26:57.158
-Owen, what are you doing?
-I'm-- [grunts]

26:57.241 --> 26:58.284
[April] You okay?

26:58.367 --> 26:59.576
-[Owen] Well, thank you.
-[audience chuckles]

27:01.077 --> 27:04.165
Anyway... she said yes!

27:04.248 --> 27:05.707
-[April squeals]
-[Owen chuckles]

27:05.791 --> 27:07.584
[audience applauds]

27:16.510 --> 27:19.763
Stop, stop! Stop!
Stop clapping!

27:19.846 --> 27:21.056
[applause stops]

27:21.139 --> 27:22.224
How could you pick her?

27:22.308 --> 27:24.768
-I'm way more attractive.
-[all laughing]

27:27.563 --> 27:29.105
-[Miranda] Stop it!
-[laughing continues]

27:29.981 --> 27:31.107
Why are you laughing?

27:33.277 --> 27:35.196
Why is it funny that someone
would love me?

27:35.279 --> 27:36.780
[laughing stops]

27:46.457 --> 27:47.916
-Uh...
-[April stutters]

27:49.042 --> 27:50.377
Um...

27:50.461 --> 27:53.046
I... think you should go.

27:55.549 --> 27:57.259
-[screams] Give me that ring!
-No, no!

27:57.343 --> 27:59.094
-Just-- Give me the ring!
-[Owen grunting]

27:59.177 --> 28:00.429
Give me the ring!

28:00.512 --> 28:02.013
-[shrieks] Give me the ring!
-[Owen] No, no--

28:02.097 --> 28:03.557
It's mine!

28:03.640 --> 28:05.642
[no audible dialogue]

28:13.484 --> 28:16.237
Mom, don't let them do this to me!
Someone help, please!

28:16.320 --> 28:17.988
Mom!

28:41.011 --> 28:43.138
[phone ringing]

28:49.561 --> 28:50.729
[answering machine beeps]

28:50.812 --> 28:54.149
[Miranda crying]
<i>Mom? Pick up!</i>

28:55.776 --> 28:57.110
<i>Uncle Jim!</i>

28:58.362 --> 28:59.780
<i>Are you there?</i>

29:05.452 --> 29:08.330
[door opens and closes]

29:17.256 --> 29:19.007
[phone vibrating]

29:21.092 --> 29:22.135
[sighs]

29:23.512 --> 29:24.888
[phone vibrating]

29:29.935 --> 29:33.146
[phone vibrating]

30:26.241 --> 30:28.619
[Miranda] Hello?
Where is everyone?

30:28.702 --> 30:29.703
[Bethany] Oh...

30:31.413 --> 30:32.789
What time is it?

30:34.040 --> 30:36.710
Well, if it isn't the little mother
who couldn't be bothered to come

30:36.793 --> 30:38.670
to her own daughter's performance.

30:39.463 --> 30:40.964
Oh, did I...

30:41.047 --> 30:42.799
Did I sleep through it?

30:46.219 --> 30:47.929
I asked you for one thing, Mom.

30:48.680 --> 30:49.848
One thing.

30:50.641 --> 30:51.892
To be there!

30:53.894 --> 30:55.604
Oh, Miranda, you're all wet!

30:55.687 --> 30:56.772
Yeah, I'm all wet!

30:56.855 --> 30:59.190
I had to walk home in the rain
'cause no one was there for me.

30:59.274 --> 31:00.817
And it's all your fault!

31:00.901 --> 31:03.153
No, that's-- No. No!

31:07.991 --> 31:09.159
"No"?

31:10.411 --> 31:11.662
That's it?

31:12.913 --> 31:14.373
You have nothing else to say?

31:15.582 --> 31:18.835
Nothing, Mom? Nothing else
you want to say to me? Mom?

31:18.919 --> 31:21.254
Do you want to know
why I wasn't there, Miranda?

31:22.088 --> 31:23.840
Where are you going?

31:25.967 --> 31:28.387
These are why I missed
your petty little show!

31:29.095 --> 31:30.305
[Bethany gasping]

31:30.389 --> 31:34.142
They make me... drowsy
and they make me forget things!

31:34.225 --> 31:36.562
But I have to take them,
because if I don't

31:36.645 --> 31:39.565
my kidneys could fail
before I find a donor!

31:40.732 --> 31:41.733
[Bethany sighs]

31:43.234 --> 31:45.070
I might die, Miranda.

31:48.532 --> 31:51.284
And all you care about is yourself!

31:56.623 --> 31:59.501
And I feel like... I'm drowning.

32:01.462 --> 32:03.630
[sobbing] And I'm so scared.

32:03.714 --> 32:06.257
I'm so scared.

32:06.341 --> 32:07.509
[Bethany sniffles]

32:08.760 --> 32:12.764
And no one in this family
is willing to just reach down

32:12.848 --> 32:15.016
-in the water to help me.
-[pill bottle clatters]

32:17.185 --> 32:18.729
I can't do this.

32:20.689 --> 32:22.774
[sniffs] I'm leaving.

32:24.610 --> 32:26.695
-Where are you going?
-[sniffs]

32:27.403 --> 32:28.905
I don't know.

32:30.281 --> 32:31.825
But I don't want to be here.

32:34.620 --> 32:35.746
Fine!

32:37.080 --> 32:38.206
Fine?

32:50.426 --> 32:51.595
[softly] Fine.

33:15.160 --> 33:16.369
[sniffles]

33:40.476 --> 33:42.646
Uncle Jim... [inhales sharply]

33:42.729 --> 33:44.105
Uncle Jim, it worked!

33:56.492 --> 33:57.578
[mouse clicking]

34:27.774 --> 34:28.942
[continues clicking]

34:46.877 --> 34:48.043
[bicycle bell rings]

34:50.045 --> 34:52.465
[classical music playing]
