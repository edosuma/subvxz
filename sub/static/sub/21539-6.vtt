Previously on<i>Million Dollar</i>
<i>Listing New York...</i>

00:04.838 --> 00:06.072
There's something very artistic
about it.

00:06.106 --> 00:07.340
Jackson Pollock lived here.

00:07.374 --> 00:09.509
There's a magic number
that I have in mind.

00:09.542 --> 00:11.511
46 was actually Jackson
Pollock's favorite number.

00:11.544 --> 00:14.114
- And I have your word on 1.46.
- 1.46.

00:14.147 --> 00:15.615
- We have a deal.
- Ah.

00:15.648 --> 00:18.018
Emilia called me,
and she said it was a no.

00:18.051 --> 00:19.486
Do you ask a lot of people
for their eggs?

00:21.554 --> 00:23.189
The second thing
is 19th Street.

00:23.223 --> 00:24.391
I don't think
it's going to work out.

00:24.424 --> 00:25.959
Is this because
you already have offers?

00:25.992 --> 00:27.293
- No.
- We're good, man.

00:27.327 --> 00:28.528
You can sell at 19th Street
and keep all the money

00:28.561 --> 00:30.764
and use my staging ideas.

00:32.766 --> 00:35.235
[upbeat music]

00:35.268 --> 00:40.340
(Ryan)
My motto is expansion,
always in all ways.

00:40.373 --> 00:43.743
(Luis)
New York City, it's the most
exciting city for real estate,

00:43.777 --> 00:45.178
and that's why I'm here.

00:45.211 --> 00:47.714
(Fredrik)
I'm the closer
and a listing machine.

00:47.747 --> 00:49.783
What makes me better is that
I work harder than anyone else.

00:49.816 --> 00:50.850
Whee!

00:50.884 --> 00:52.686
We're friends now, right?

00:52.719 --> 00:55.088
I don't need him,
and you don't either.

00:55.121 --> 00:57.023
This will never end.

00:57.057 --> 01:00.093
* *

01:01.528 --> 01:04.898
* *

01:04.931 --> 01:08.301
Yuri, we are going
to 82nd Street and East End,

01:08.335 --> 01:10.770
right where it hits
Gracie Terrace.

01:10.804 --> 01:14.174
82nd and East End
has easy access to the highway,

01:14.207 --> 01:16.876
is surrounded by
great schools and restaurants.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.679
It's primarily known
for Gracie Mansion,

01:19.713 --> 01:21.081
which is where
the mayor lives.

01:21.114 --> 01:24.918
This is a very particular part
of the Upper East Side.

01:24.951 --> 01:28.088
And people who are there,
they want to die there.

01:31.224 --> 01:32.792
[elevator dings]

01:32.826 --> 01:34.160
- Hi, welcome back.
- Good to see you.

01:34.194 --> 01:36.629
Good to see you as well.
Thank you.

01:36.663 --> 01:38.098
My favorite blonde!

01:38.131 --> 01:39.499
We just sold out the building.

01:39.532 --> 01:41.101
Here's your next project
to sell out.

01:41.134 --> 01:42.902
- What do you mean?
- This is the next building.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.339
(Ryan)
I love Yvonne.

01:46.373 --> 01:48.942
She promised,
and now she's delivering.

01:48.975 --> 01:50.810
This building
is a six-story building,

01:50.844 --> 01:52.278
but it's only four units.

01:52.312 --> 01:55.115
Got it.

01:55.115 --> 01:58.952
Like Yvonne's last project,
this is a boutique condominium

01:58.985 --> 02:01.855
built from the ground up.

02:01.888 --> 02:04.624
The four units in the building
start at the ground floor

02:04.657 --> 02:06.059
with the maisonette.

02:06.092 --> 02:09.095
* *

02:09.129 --> 02:11.531
This is a four-bed,
three-bath duplex

02:11.564 --> 02:13.633
with its own backyard.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.335
The third floor
is a single-story

02:15.368 --> 02:19.305
two-bedroom, two-bathroom
with 1500 square feet.

02:19.339 --> 02:22.942
The upper floors consist
of two duplex units.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.644
Love the staircase.

02:24.678 --> 02:25.845
I feel like
I'm in the Hamptons.

02:25.879 --> 02:27.380
That was the idea.

02:27.414 --> 02:28.915
(Ryan)
The lower duplex

02:28.948 --> 02:31.651
is a four-bed, three-bath,

02:31.685 --> 02:34.921
while the upper duplex,
the one that we're in,

02:34.954 --> 02:37.490
is a three-bedroom,
three-bathroom

02:37.524 --> 02:38.925
with a roof deck.

02:38.958 --> 02:44.297
* *

02:44.330 --> 02:45.865
I love the ceilings.

02:45.899 --> 02:48.735
There's a huge difference
between this and 63rd.

02:48.768 --> 02:52.372
This building has
top-of-the-line finishes.

02:52.405 --> 02:55.508
You've got high-end
stainless steel appliances.

02:55.542 --> 02:57.944
You've got masonry fireplaces.

02:57.977 --> 03:00.113
This is so big.
I could fit in there.

03:00.146 --> 03:01.181
[laughs]

03:01.214 --> 03:04.050
(Yvonne)
You have a steam shower,
Jacuzzi.

03:04.050 --> 03:05.618
(Ryan)
You have radiant heat
under these floors as well?

03:05.652 --> 03:07.187
Yes, we do,
throughout the entire apartment.

03:07.220 --> 03:08.922
(Ryan)
So no one will ever
have cold feet.

03:08.955 --> 03:10.890
Speaking of cold feet,
when's the wedding?

03:10.924 --> 03:14.060
Uh, like 2022 or something.
Don't worry about it.

03:14.094 --> 03:18.298
Yvonne is like Emilia's sister
coming after me, saying,

03:18.331 --> 03:20.066
"Where's the ring? Where's
the ring? Where's the ring?"

03:20.066 --> 03:21.868
This ring was very expensive.

03:21.901 --> 03:23.603
I can see
where your head's at.

03:24.771 --> 03:28.241
My feet are still
a little chilly,

03:28.274 --> 03:30.744
but they're starting
to warm up.

03:32.645 --> 03:36.616
This property is really going
to be about working smarter,

03:36.649 --> 03:38.218
not harder.

03:38.251 --> 03:40.653
I had a huge turnout
at the open house

03:40.687 --> 03:43.123
for Yvonne's last development
that I did.

03:43.156 --> 03:44.524
- Hi. Welcome.
- Hi.

03:44.557 --> 03:45.725
And everybody loved it.

03:45.759 --> 03:47.093
This is fantastic.

03:48.094 --> 03:49.763
Because the new building
is so similar,

03:49.796 --> 03:52.966
I'm going to reach out
to all of those same people

03:52.999 --> 03:54.734
because I already have
a built-in audience.

03:54.768 --> 03:57.370
What do you think an apartment
like this should go for?

03:58.972 --> 04:01.541
I know Yvonne has already
priced the building,

04:01.574 --> 04:03.476
so is this a test?

04:03.510 --> 04:05.945
A big three-bedroom,

04:06.046 --> 04:10.950
probably right around 4.8-ish.

04:13.286 --> 04:15.188
It's an aggressive price per
square foot, but it's not crazy.

04:18.858 --> 04:20.927
- I like the way you think.
- Yeah? Is it...

04:20.960 --> 04:22.729
Because that's right in line
with the pricing.

04:22.762 --> 04:23.930
Okay.

04:23.963 --> 04:25.265
Yvonne is smart.

04:25.298 --> 04:29.803
2,000 a foot is definitely
on the high end

04:29.836 --> 04:32.405
of the average
for this neighborhood.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.107
But given what Yvonne
is building

04:34.140 --> 04:36.810
and how beautiful
the product is,

04:36.843 --> 04:38.511
I honestly think
it's a very fair price.

04:38.545 --> 04:40.213
I think if you can sell
for those numbers,

04:40.246 --> 04:42.082
this is going to be the building
that pays for your wedding.

04:43.983 --> 04:47.087
Doesn't the--doesn't the bride's
parents pay for the wedding?

04:48.822 --> 04:50.156
Are you serious?

04:51.524 --> 04:53.827
(Yvonne)
You better get to work.

04:53.860 --> 04:59.299
* *

04:59.332 --> 05:01.334
(Fredrik)
The West Village

05:01.368 --> 05:04.371
is one of the oldest,
oldest parts of Manhattan.

05:04.404 --> 05:06.639
You see New York
from the side.

05:06.673 --> 05:09.075
You have, like,
all the skyscrapers of downtown,

05:09.109 --> 05:10.744
and then there's this slope.

05:10.777 --> 05:14.080
In that slope,
the lowest part of Manhattan,

05:14.114 --> 05:15.782
is the West Village.

05:15.815 --> 05:19.319
It's all historic and landmark,
and you cannot build high.

05:19.352 --> 05:21.321
(Jared)
Fredrik, welcome.

05:21.354 --> 05:22.622
- Jared Chassen.
- Hi, Jared.

05:22.655 --> 05:23.623
Tom Ryan.

05:23.656 --> 05:25.058
Wow, it's big.

05:25.058 --> 05:26.860
(Tom)
It was a multi-family home.

05:26.893 --> 05:29.462
There were ten apartments.
We did a total gut renovation.

05:29.496 --> 05:32.565
And you're calling me
to get a high price.

05:33.566 --> 05:34.601
Whoo!

05:34.634 --> 05:37.604
* *

05:37.637 --> 05:40.106
(Fredrik)
This townhouse is massive.

05:40.140 --> 05:42.609
7,000 square feet.

05:44.077 --> 05:46.579
(Jared)
This floor is the master suite.

05:46.613 --> 05:48.314
- Wait, this entire floor?
- Entire floor.

05:48.348 --> 05:51.985
So that's 50x25.
1,250 square feet?

05:52.085 --> 05:53.253
- Correct.
- Wow.

05:53.286 --> 06:00.860
* *

06:00.894 --> 06:03.596
We know that there's most likely
stone on the floors.

06:03.630 --> 06:06.633
We want to know exactly what
you need to achieve the price

06:06.666 --> 06:07.867
that we want to get.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.869
Okay. That's a good answer.
I like that.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.607
I just love
unfinished real estate,

06:14.641 --> 06:17.377
because it's like Fredrik
comes in with painting his name

06:17.410 --> 06:18.845
in graffiti all over the walls.

06:21.314 --> 06:23.416
All that beautiful light
coming in, south-facing.

06:23.450 --> 06:26.586
Those walls--zzzh--
in the summer months.

06:26.619 --> 06:29.422
I'm known for being really hands
on in any kind of development

06:29.456 --> 06:31.825
and actually picking out
the finishes

06:31.858 --> 06:33.693
and programming
a building like this.

06:34.694 --> 06:36.696
Gorgeous.
This is incredible.

06:36.730 --> 06:40.834
Okay, what is the price
that you're thinking?

06:40.867 --> 06:42.702
Mid-20 million.

06:42.736 --> 06:46.840
- 25 million?
- 25 million.

06:46.873 --> 06:51.378
Houses in this area trade
for like 2,200, 2,300 a foot.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.712
You think you can get
$4,000 a foot?

06:52.746 --> 06:53.947
That's why you're here.

06:53.980 --> 06:56.683
(Fredrik)
The house is huge,

06:56.716 --> 07:00.020
but it doesn't have
some of the drama

07:00.020 --> 07:02.922
that some of the other
record-breaking townhouses do.

07:03.023 --> 07:05.892
It's wide, but it isn't, like,
mansion wide.

07:05.925 --> 07:08.361
And this garden--
I'm not trying to be negative,

07:08.395 --> 07:10.897
but it's my job to tell you
the truth: it's small.

07:10.930 --> 07:13.500
And you're also--
which I think is a good thing,

07:13.533 --> 07:16.369
because I'm a young, cool guy--
close to Meatpacking.

07:16.403 --> 07:19.639
But the old money might say,

07:19.673 --> 07:22.308
"I don't want to be a block away
from those clubs and bars."

07:22.342 --> 07:25.245
In our minds, you're close
enough but not too close.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.047
You're just
the right distance away.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.349
Guys, 25 million,
that's outrageous.

07:29.382 --> 07:30.850
What's your number?

07:30.884 --> 07:33.553
I would say 20.
A tad above--

07:33.586 --> 07:34.821
It's been a pleasure
meeting you.

07:34.854 --> 07:38.058
Guys, 4,000 a foot,
I would do you a disservice.

07:38.058 --> 07:41.227
It would be sitting
on the market forever.

07:41.261 --> 07:44.297
I'm telling you,
to get even to 20, 21 million,

07:44.330 --> 07:46.499
you're going to have to spend
a lot of money...

07:49.069 --> 07:52.305
It's always difficult to sell
an unfinished product,

07:52.339 --> 07:55.342
let alone at this insane price.

07:55.375 --> 07:59.079
But if I can get these guys to
agree on upgrading the finishes,

07:59.079 --> 08:01.014
and I'm talking
top-of-the-line finishes,

08:01.014 --> 08:04.484
then at least I can get
some renderings done now

08:04.517 --> 08:06.219
and get the buzz going,

08:06.252 --> 08:09.522
even though construction won't
be done for a few more months.

08:09.556 --> 08:11.157
Okay, let's do this.

08:11.191 --> 08:14.794
Let me introduce you
to an interior designer

08:14.828 --> 08:17.097
that can get you
a higher number.

08:17.130 --> 08:18.331
Not 25.

08:18.365 --> 08:20.567
Maybe 22 1/2.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.502
But I'm talking, like,
going all out,

08:22.535 --> 08:24.037
deep down in your pockets.

08:24.037 --> 08:25.071
Are you ready to spend?

08:25.105 --> 08:27.907
[suspenseful music]

08:27.941 --> 08:28.942
Bring the designers.

08:29.042 --> 08:31.277
Show me what you can do.

08:31.311 --> 08:32.412
And we have a deal.

08:32.445 --> 08:33.413
Get us close.

08:33.446 --> 08:34.414
Somewhere in between
20 and 25.

08:34.447 --> 08:35.415
Somewhere in between.

08:35.448 --> 08:36.850
- Okay?
- Okay.

08:36.883 --> 08:38.451
- Okay? Okay, okay, okay.
- All right.

08:38.485 --> 08:41.354
22 1/2 million
is still really high.

08:41.388 --> 08:44.958
Now I have to find
an amazing interior designer

08:45.058 --> 08:47.293
that can justify
these numbers.

08:47.327 --> 08:49.462
Congrats to
a great building.

08:49.496 --> 08:50.663
To us.

08:50.697 --> 08:52.399
To me. Whee!

08:53.867 --> 09:00.473
* *

09:00.507 --> 09:02.409
(Luis)
Shut the f*** up!

09:02.442 --> 09:04.310
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

09:04.344 --> 09:06.613
Aah!

09:06.646 --> 09:07.647
This is bad.

09:09.315 --> 09:11.017
I can't f***ing believe it.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.552
For the past few months,

09:12.585 --> 09:14.587
I've actually been aggressively
trying to reach

09:14.621 --> 09:16.489
one of the biggest developers
in Manhattan.

09:17.590 --> 09:19.059
Hi, can I speak to Gerard?

09:21.127 --> 09:22.362
I already left a message
this morning.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.863
This is Luis Ortiz.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.331
Just let him know
that I called, please.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.877
So he finally agrees
for me to meet him

09:37.911 --> 09:39.779
to talk
about his latest project,

09:39.813 --> 09:41.748
and my alarm doesn't
f***ing go off.

09:41.781 --> 09:43.483
Like, what the f***?

09:43.516 --> 09:45.585
I have to be in Brooklyn
in less than an hour.

09:45.618 --> 09:47.821
Come on, come on.

09:47.854 --> 09:49.055
I'm f***ed.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.294
[phone line ringing]

09:54.327 --> 09:56.730
Come on, guys.
Move, move, move!

09:56.763 --> 09:58.465
Ronita, I'm not even
in Brooklyn.

09:58.498 --> 10:01.368
I'm supposed to be there
in 15 minutes.

10:02.702 --> 10:04.571
I still need to go
to the Brooklyn Bridge.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.573
You know how much traffic
there is right now?

10:06.606 --> 10:09.275
[dramatic music]

10:09.309 --> 10:12.812
I am sitting in the fastest car
on mother****ing planet Earth,

10:12.846 --> 10:14.814
and I can't even move
more than 5 miles an hour.

10:14.848 --> 10:17.817
Come on, come on!

10:17.851 --> 10:22.622
This is probably the most
important meeting of my career,

10:22.655 --> 10:25.058
and I am f***ing
going to miss it.

10:25.091 --> 10:27.027
Green light!

10:30.163 --> 10:31.398
(Ryan)
Coming up...

10:31.431 --> 10:34.768
Where are we exactly
with the approved finishes?

10:34.801 --> 10:35.902
Wait, wait, I'm doing a party,

10:35.935 --> 10:37.003
and we don't have
approved finishes?

10:37.037 --> 10:39.272
I have 400 brokers
coming in half an hour.

10:46.413 --> 10:49.382
[dramatic music]

10:49.416 --> 10:57.757
* *

10:57.791 --> 10:59.325
Yes!

11:00.827 --> 11:02.562
(Luis)
Brooklyn, on time.

11:02.595 --> 11:03.897
I made it.

11:03.930 --> 11:05.198
Let's go.

11:05.231 --> 11:08.201
Gerard Longo, it is an honor
and a privilege.

11:08.234 --> 11:09.769
Gerard Longo specializes

11:09.803 --> 11:12.172
in architecturally beautiful
buildings.

11:12.205 --> 11:14.374
But not only that,
he's one of those developers

11:14.407 --> 11:17.277
that just puts so much detail
into every finish.

11:17.310 --> 11:20.513
This is the guy that I want
to work with.

11:20.547 --> 11:22.549
You are pretty much
the hardest guy to reach

11:22.582 --> 11:23.750
in the face of this earth.

11:23.783 --> 11:25.385
Well, listen, we're here.

11:25.418 --> 11:27.387
But you have a monumental task
ahead of you,

11:27.420 --> 11:29.456
because there's no need for us
to speak to brokers.

11:29.489 --> 11:30.690
Okay?

11:30.724 --> 11:33.226
(Luis)
Gerard is not just a developer.

11:33.259 --> 11:35.462
He's also the owner
of the brokerage firm

11:35.495 --> 11:37.564
that has sold the first eight
out of nine townhouses

11:37.597 --> 11:38.765
of this project,

11:38.798 --> 11:41.601
which means
there's still one left.

11:41.634 --> 11:43.236
And I want to be the person
that sells it.

11:43.269 --> 11:45.271
You're persistent,
but the truth is,

11:45.305 --> 11:47.474
my secretaries don't want
to hear your name anymore.

11:47.507 --> 11:49.843
So let's get into it.

11:49.876 --> 11:51.945
[upbeat music]

11:51.978 --> 11:54.414
Gerard Longo is developing
a project

11:54.447 --> 11:56.750
called The Townhouses
of Cobble Hill.

11:56.783 --> 11:58.818
Cobble Hill is a very small
neighborhood in Brooklyn

11:58.852 --> 12:01.955
where you can find classic,
old barbershops

12:02.055 --> 12:03.823
next to trendy restaurants.

12:03.857 --> 12:06.359
It's known for the blend
of old and new.

12:06.393 --> 12:09.596
This project consists
of nine luxury townhouses,

12:09.629 --> 12:12.098
four of them restored
from its original facade

12:12.132 --> 12:14.401
and five built
from the ground up.

12:14.434 --> 12:16.436
The last remaining home
available

12:16.469 --> 12:17.904
is the corner townhouse.

12:17.937 --> 12:20.907
It's over 3,300 square feet
of indoor space,

12:20.940 --> 12:23.076
and they're asking
just under 4 million.

12:23.109 --> 12:25.445
* *

12:25.478 --> 12:26.780
(Gerard)
Everything in this job

12:26.813 --> 12:28.915
is handpicked, handmade.

12:28.948 --> 12:30.550
(Luis)
I heard that you actually

12:30.583 --> 12:32.352
go to Italy yourself
to pick the exact tiles,

12:32.385 --> 12:34.087
and if the vein in the marble
is not right,

12:34.120 --> 12:35.989
you go crazy
and then you go back

12:36.089 --> 12:37.290
and actually pick another one,

12:37.323 --> 12:38.458
even if it costs you
twice the money.

12:38.491 --> 12:39.659
You know what?

12:39.693 --> 12:41.127
It seems like
you've done your homework.

12:41.161 --> 12:43.096
We do pay attention
to detail.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.631
It seems like you pay attention
to detail too.

12:44.664 --> 12:45.899
Let me show you the roof.

12:45.932 --> 12:47.133
- All right?
- Yes.

12:49.536 --> 12:50.804
All right!

12:52.105 --> 12:53.306
(Luis)
This is amazing.

12:53.340 --> 12:55.809
Wine, sunsets.

12:55.842 --> 12:57.677
Everything about the design
of this home is amazing.

12:57.711 --> 12:59.212
(Gerard)
Why don't we take a walk?

12:59.245 --> 13:00.847
(Luis)
I got all the time in the world
for you, Gerard.

13:00.880 --> 13:03.583
My intention is for Gerard
to understand

13:03.616 --> 13:04.684
I want to build
a relationship.

13:04.718 --> 13:06.686
Gerard, you own
a brokerage company.

13:06.720 --> 13:09.289
That brokerage company
is extremely strong in Brooklyn.

13:10.690 --> 13:12.759
I want to offer you
something more.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.795
Luis...

13:15.829 --> 13:18.498
we're already getting full price
on everything that we've sold.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.502
I don't want this to be an
exercise in metal masturbation.

13:23.536 --> 13:25.238
I don't know if there's a need.

13:25.271 --> 13:26.973
(Luis)
I want to show Gerard

13:27.073 --> 13:30.810
that through my network,
which extends around the globe,

13:30.844 --> 13:34.447
I could create such a demand
for this last townhouse

13:34.481 --> 13:36.316
that it'll sell
at top dollar.

13:36.349 --> 13:38.284
I have networks
in Europe, in Singapore,

13:38.318 --> 13:39.786
in Australia, in Asia.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.955
With all due respect,
you actually need me.

13:41.988 --> 13:44.391
The international money,

13:44.424 --> 13:46.626
it's what's driving
this market

13:46.659 --> 13:48.294
to the craziness
we have today.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.497
And every place
that I've been to,

13:50.530 --> 13:52.766
I have made connections
that I have kept in touch with,

13:52.799 --> 13:54.601
and it constantly
keeps on growing.

13:54.634 --> 13:56.202
I've been planting seeds
all around.

13:56.236 --> 13:57.437
I'm a f***ing farmer.

13:57.470 --> 13:59.372
[laughs]

13:59.406 --> 14:01.941
My value is not just
for this particular project.

14:02.042 --> 14:05.078
My value is for everything

14:05.111 --> 14:06.446
that you are thinking
about doing in the future--

14:06.479 --> 14:08.581
your five new projects
here in Brooklyn,

14:08.615 --> 14:09.783
your hotels in Miami.

14:09.816 --> 14:11.751
And this is going to be
the beta test?

14:11.785 --> 14:14.521
I need to prove myself before
we actually build something.

14:14.554 --> 14:16.823
Luis...

14:16.856 --> 14:19.826
[suspenseful music]

14:19.859 --> 14:22.295
* *

14:22.328 --> 14:24.431
I'm going to take it
into strong consideration.

14:24.464 --> 14:26.599
Strongly into consideration.

14:26.633 --> 14:28.735
If I don't, my phone will be
ringing and ringing and ringing,

14:28.768 --> 14:30.837
and I want to make sure
that that stops.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.072
- All right?
- Thank you so much.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.073
- You're welcome, okay?
- You too.

14:33.073 --> 14:34.107
Have a good day.
Bye-bye now.

14:34.140 --> 14:35.308
By the way,
I love the whole thing.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.844
- Thank you.
- I'll be waiting for your call.

14:38.845 --> 14:41.281
10 bucks
he calls me tomorrow.

14:41.314 --> 14:42.482
[claps hands and exhales]

14:42.515 --> 14:43.683
Yes!

14:43.717 --> 14:44.918
Oh, I love my life.

14:46.619 --> 14:51.358
* *

14:51.391 --> 14:53.426
- R.D.!
- Yeah.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.462
So...

14:55.495 --> 14:56.529
do you have a girlfriend?

14:56.563 --> 14:58.732
No.

14:58.765 --> 15:00.533
You've never been engaged
or anything?

15:00.567 --> 15:01.801
No.

15:01.835 --> 15:05.438
If you were to propose,
hypothetically,

15:05.472 --> 15:06.439
like, how would you--

15:06.473 --> 15:08.775
No, no, no.
What are you, crazy?

15:08.808 --> 15:10.243
Before I met Emilia,

15:10.276 --> 15:12.212
living in New York
as a single guy,

15:12.245 --> 15:13.546
I would be the first person
to say that I had

15:13.580 --> 15:14.781
as much fun as possible.

15:14.814 --> 15:16.383
- Don't do that.
- [laughs]

15:19.853 --> 15:21.855
But I've had way more fun
in the last two years

15:21.888 --> 15:23.490
since I've met her.

15:23.523 --> 15:25.759
It's been a fun
and a love to the core

15:25.792 --> 15:27.227
that I didn't even know
was possible.

15:27.260 --> 15:31.064
Like, what would be, like,
the coolest way to propose?

15:31.064 --> 15:32.065
Underwater.

15:32.065 --> 15:34.067
[whimsical music]

15:34.100 --> 15:37.070
What if you drop the ring
in the water?

15:37.070 --> 15:38.705
In a helicopter
above the city?

15:38.738 --> 15:40.340
That's too dangerous.

15:40.373 --> 15:41.775
- How about on a boat?
- No.

15:41.808 --> 15:42.876
- Jet Skis?
- No.

15:42.909 --> 15:45.311
- Skydiving.
- Are you insane?

15:45.345 --> 15:46.312
Times Square?

15:46.346 --> 15:49.883
* *

15:49.916 --> 15:52.085
What if I shut down
Times Square?

15:52.118 --> 15:55.355
And all of a sudden
Times Square is totally empty,

15:55.388 --> 15:56.990
and it's just ours?

15:59.092 --> 16:01.161
I want to create a moment
that Emilia will remember

16:01.194 --> 16:02.495
for the rest of her life.

16:02.529 --> 16:04.164
No one's ever
done it before.

16:04.197 --> 16:06.499
But I don't think
it's going to be possible.

16:06.533 --> 16:10.170
I can do it. Get me
Times Square's phone number.

16:10.203 --> 16:17.677
* *

16:17.711 --> 16:19.145
[exhales]

16:20.513 --> 16:22.615
- Hi.
- Fredrik.

16:22.649 --> 16:23.950
(Fredrik)
I like this space. Beautiful.

16:24.050 --> 16:26.419
How many people
can we fit in here?

16:26.453 --> 16:28.054
(Fredrik)
I am not going to wait

16:28.054 --> 16:29.422
for this townhouse
in the West Village

16:29.456 --> 16:30.824
to be fully renovated.

16:30.857 --> 16:32.859
I am going to sell it now,
maybe at tonight's event.

16:32.892 --> 16:34.060
[both inhale and exhale]

16:34.060 --> 16:36.963
This is a perfect opportunity
for someone

16:37.063 --> 16:39.966
to own a 7,000-square-foot
townhouse

16:40.066 --> 16:41.634
on one of the best blocks
in all Manhattan.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.970
We need to create
hype and urgency.

16:44.070 --> 16:46.106
Everyone's going to want
to come and see the house.

16:46.139 --> 16:48.108
My idea here is for you
specifically

16:48.141 --> 16:49.709
to be a little difficult,

16:49.743 --> 16:51.244
like everybody wants
what they can't have.

16:51.277 --> 16:52.479
Oh.

16:52.512 --> 16:53.913
And everybody wants
what everybody else wants,

16:53.947 --> 16:56.182
so you should have an iPad or
something and take appointments.

16:56.216 --> 16:57.317
Okay.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.386
Hi. How are you?

16:59.419 --> 17:00.587
You look so good.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.255
After I got this listing,

17:02.288 --> 17:03.590
I introduced the developer

17:03.623 --> 17:06.793
to the top interior designer
in New York City.

17:06.826 --> 17:09.829
And we all agreed on an amazing
package for the finishes.

17:09.863 --> 17:11.297
Gorgeous marble pattern.

17:11.331 --> 17:13.933
Trim on the vanities.
Stone top.

17:14.034 --> 17:15.435
That's a good feeling.

17:15.468 --> 17:18.605
Because of the developers'
willingness to spend top dollar,

17:18.638 --> 17:21.474
the renderings look amazing.

17:22.509 --> 17:23.843
And I have decided

17:23.877 --> 17:26.479
to list the house
at the very high price

17:26.513 --> 17:28.648
of 22.5 million.

17:28.682 --> 17:32.585
Where are we exactly
with the approved finishes?

17:32.619 --> 17:34.054
Excuse me? We're not?

17:34.087 --> 17:36.056
[cell phone rings]
- Wait, are you kidding?

17:38.258 --> 17:39.225
Yeah.

17:39.259 --> 17:40.593
Wait, wait, I'm doing a party,

17:40.627 --> 17:42.729
and we don't have
approved finishes?

17:42.762 --> 17:44.097
What exactly
is not approved by--

17:50.503 --> 17:52.739
I have 400 brokers
coming in half an hour.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.974
And I have renderings
printed on brochures,

17:55.075 --> 17:56.710
and I'm ready to go,
and now,

17:56.743 --> 17:59.379
29 minutes before the event,

17:59.412 --> 18:02.182
they tell me that the finishes
might not even happen?

18:02.215 --> 18:03.616
Simply put, it's too late.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.652
I got to talk to them
and resolve this.

18:05.685 --> 18:07.087
Can I have a drink?

18:08.855 --> 18:10.023
(Luis)
Coming up...

18:10.056 --> 18:11.424
These very sophisticated
European people,

18:11.458 --> 18:13.593
they see Brooklyn as the cheaper
version of Manhattan.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.862
Yeah, I would say that that's
an ignorant statement.

18:20.033 --> 18:23.069
[upbeat music]

18:23.103 --> 18:24.070
[indistinct chatter]

18:24.104 --> 18:25.071
- Hi, you.
- Hi.

18:25.105 --> 18:26.072
Oh, my God,
you're so beautiful.

18:26.106 --> 18:27.073
Nice to see you.

18:27.107 --> 18:29.042
- Hi, guys. Welcome.
- Hello.

18:30.310 --> 18:31.311
Have a champagne.

18:33.046 --> 18:35.115
Inside, I am screaming
of stress

18:35.148 --> 18:37.884
because what my developer
has said about the finishes...

18:37.917 --> 18:39.519
Mwah, mwah!

18:39.552 --> 18:42.222
But above the surface,
in front of my guests,

18:42.255 --> 18:45.959
I am perfect grace
under pressure.

18:46.059 --> 18:48.294
Welcome to my party.

18:48.328 --> 18:51.631
I just really want to thank you
for this amazing turnout

18:51.664 --> 18:53.700
for my beautiful new townhome.

18:53.733 --> 18:54.901
It's a couple blocks away.

18:54.934 --> 18:56.069
I wasn't going to toss

18:56.069 --> 18:57.470
the brochures
to be printed up.

18:57.504 --> 18:59.072
I mean, if I'm going
to do a party,

18:59.072 --> 19:00.540
people need something
to look at.

19:00.573 --> 19:02.409
So please sell it with me,
and I love all of you.

19:02.442 --> 19:03.877
Thank you.

19:03.910 --> 19:07.280
What I need to do is to bring
my developers to their senses.

19:07.313 --> 19:13.219
* *

19:13.253 --> 19:14.587
- Hi, how are you?
- Hi, Fredrik, how are you?

19:14.621 --> 19:15.755
- Good to see you.
- Nice to see you.

19:15.789 --> 19:17.657
- Hi. Good to see you.
(both) How are you?

19:17.691 --> 19:18.725
I mean,
look at all these people.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.026
- It's crazy.
- It looks great.

19:20.026 --> 19:22.395
So where are we--
where are we with everything,

19:22.429 --> 19:23.563
like finishes?

19:23.596 --> 19:26.566
[suspenseful music]

19:26.599 --> 19:27.734
* *

19:27.767 --> 19:29.502
I'm going to start
doing showings.

19:29.536 --> 19:30.870
We're filling the calendar up
with appointments.

19:30.904 --> 19:32.672
So I just want to know
that we have everything locked

19:32.706 --> 19:34.541
and perfection
when I start showing.

19:36.609 --> 19:37.744
(Fredrik)
Soft--What does that mean?

19:37.777 --> 19:40.547
- Soft-locked.
- I don't like soft.

19:40.580 --> 19:42.048
I already told
all these 400 brokers

19:42.048 --> 19:43.917
what the listing price is:
22.5 million.

19:43.950 --> 19:47.454
They are expecting
top-of-the-line finishes.

19:47.487 --> 19:49.055
My reputation
is on the line here.

19:56.329 --> 19:59.065
It's a little unusual to be
talking about soft-locked

19:59.099 --> 20:01.401
on a launch party
when I'm supposed to sell it.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.470
When can we--
when can we hard-lock?

20:07.640 --> 20:09.843
[dramatic music]

20:09.876 --> 20:11.945
I can't--I give up.

20:11.978 --> 20:16.249
* *

20:16.282 --> 20:18.585
Actually, I don't give up,
but I don't like it.

20:26.059 --> 20:28.294
[inhaling deeply]

20:28.328 --> 20:30.463
Nonetheless, I'm here.

20:30.497 --> 20:31.731
I got to do
what I do best:

20:31.765 --> 20:33.533
look forward.

20:33.566 --> 20:36.169
[upbeat music]

20:36.202 --> 20:38.304
Look at the floor plan.
Six floors.

20:38.338 --> 20:39.873
7,100 square feet.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.508
Six bedrooms,
six baths.

20:41.541 --> 20:43.343
I can answer any questions
that you might have,

20:43.376 --> 20:44.844
or if you'd like to schedule
an appointment,

20:44.878 --> 20:47.147
- we can do that as well.
- Thank you.

20:47.180 --> 20:49.082
The entire master
is on one floor.

20:49.115 --> 20:51.418
22.5 million. It's actually
a very reasonable price.

20:51.451 --> 20:52.919
He is handling the calendar
for appointments.

20:52.952 --> 20:54.654
Yeah, so if you want
to schedule something,

20:54.688 --> 20:55.855
- we can certainly do that.
- Okay.

20:55.889 --> 20:57.691
(Fredrik)
People are making appointments.

20:57.724 --> 20:59.159
Everybody wants
to see the house.

20:59.192 --> 21:00.660
The buzz is out.
The hype is there.

21:00.694 --> 21:03.063
- Julia, is it?
(both) Juliet.

21:03.063 --> 21:06.666
(Fredrik)
My plan is to start showing
the house later this week.

21:06.700 --> 21:10.837
Now I just have to hope
and pray

21:10.870 --> 21:13.640
that my developer will pick
really good finishes.

21:14.841 --> 21:16.242
Every day is fun in my life,

21:16.276 --> 21:18.311
except when I can't
sell something.

21:18.345 --> 21:20.347
Then it gets very awful.

21:20.380 --> 21:21.581
Never!

21:23.183 --> 21:31.691
* *

21:31.725 --> 21:33.860
(Luis)
So the day after I met Gerard,
he called.

21:33.893 --> 21:35.695
Did I tell you,
or did I tell you?

21:35.729 --> 21:37.430
- Gerard, good morning.
- Good morning.

21:37.464 --> 21:38.765
- How are you, sir?
- How are you?

21:38.798 --> 21:40.333
Before he makes a decision
on giving me the listing,

21:40.367 --> 21:42.769
Gerard has to ask me
to put together a marketing plan

21:42.802 --> 21:45.438
to sell the last townhouses
in his development.

21:45.472 --> 21:46.973
- Hello.
- Let me introduce you.

21:47.007 --> 21:48.008
Laura Garcia
from JMH Development.

21:48.108 --> 21:49.109
- Laura.
- Nice to meet you. Pleasure.

21:49.109 --> 21:50.243
- How are you?
- Nice to meet you.

21:50.276 --> 21:51.845
- This is Joe Baglio.
- Pleasure.

21:51.878 --> 21:53.947
So he brought his team.

21:53.980 --> 21:56.850
So you are the ones responsible
for selling the first eight.

21:56.883 --> 21:57.951
(Joe)
Correct.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.488
(Luis)
I wasn't expecting this.

22:01.521 --> 22:02.889
But this is my chance
to win Gerard over,

22:02.922 --> 22:05.759
so I'm going to pitch
whoever I have to pitch.

22:05.792 --> 22:08.461
So Brooklyn
is the New York version

22:08.495 --> 22:11.231
of Paris, Belgium, Italy.

22:11.264 --> 22:12.632
And I think, you know,
Europeans are, you know,

22:12.665 --> 22:13.900
are starting
to get to know that,

22:13.933 --> 22:15.201
and also that's a reach
that I have.

22:15.235 --> 22:17.337
These very sophisticated
European people

22:17.370 --> 22:19.739
don't know about
The Townhouses of Cobble Hill.

22:19.773 --> 22:21.307
They see Brooklyn as the cheaper
version of Manhattan.

22:21.341 --> 22:22.709
A lot of people.

22:22.742 --> 22:25.278
Yeah, I would say that
that's an ignorant statement.

22:28.648 --> 22:31.651
(Luis)
My international buyers
trust my judgment.

22:31.685 --> 22:33.653
If I told them about Gerard's
project as a place to consider,

22:33.687 --> 22:35.088
they would look into it.

22:35.121 --> 22:38.324
What I want to do is to create
a very authentic as it gets

22:38.358 --> 22:40.126
European events,

22:40.160 --> 22:42.829
but instead of inviting brokers,

22:42.862 --> 22:46.466
my idea is to do this event
for the media, for press,

22:46.499 --> 22:48.601
and every single publication
that there is in New York City

22:48.635 --> 22:51.171
or that goes actually
internationally,

22:51.204 --> 22:53.239
to be a part of this event

22:53.273 --> 22:55.108
and sort of give them
that experience

22:55.108 --> 22:57.377
of what it is to be
in a European Brooklyn.

22:57.410 --> 22:58.812
What you're hitting on
is right.

22:58.845 --> 23:00.080
I'm just not sure

23:00.113 --> 23:02.716
if that's really the best way
to convey it.

23:02.749 --> 23:05.085
Europeans love Brooklyn
because it feels like Brooklyn.

23:05.118 --> 23:06.319
It feels authentic.

23:11.725 --> 23:12.959
Of image.

23:13.059 --> 23:16.396
And some of those things
that we see become too gimmicky.

23:16.429 --> 23:19.065
At first blush,
I'm a little concerned.

23:19.099 --> 23:22.068
These two people have been
very successful with me.

23:22.102 --> 23:25.305
So when she shows concern,
I get concerned.

23:27.741 --> 23:33.580
* *

23:33.613 --> 23:35.081
(Ryan)
Yeah, take a right.

23:35.081 --> 23:36.950
Just drive over the taxis.

23:36.983 --> 23:40.453
My plan had been to start
selling East 82nd Street tonight

23:40.487 --> 23:42.088
at the launch party
I'm throwing.

23:42.088 --> 23:43.590
Hey, Kim.
It's Ryan Serhant.

23:43.623 --> 23:44.991
Hey, Katya, it's Ryan.

23:45.091 --> 23:47.360
One woman I spoke to
was very interested

23:47.394 --> 23:49.229
in the maisonette.

23:49.262 --> 23:52.198
Unfortunately, she's not able
to come to the event tonight,

23:52.232 --> 23:54.734
so I agreed to meet with her
this afternoon.

23:56.403 --> 23:58.104
[phone line rings]
- Hey.

23:58.138 --> 23:59.639
Hey, it's Ryan.
Where are you?

23:59.673 --> 24:00.807
Uh, I'm at the building.
I just got here.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.308
Just cleaning up some stuff.

24:02.342 --> 24:04.744
We're in, like, the worst
traffic that's ever existed

24:04.778 --> 24:06.613
in the history
of New York City.

24:06.646 --> 24:08.848
- Can you get here?
- I'm in the f***ing traffic!

24:08.882 --> 24:11.051
I don't--I don't know!
We can't move!

24:11.084 --> 24:13.453
Everything in real estate
is about timing.

24:13.486 --> 24:15.522
Right now,
the timing sucks.

24:15.555 --> 24:16.523
You have the Bluetooth in?

24:16.556 --> 24:17.524
You have
your Bluetooth headpiece?

24:17.557 --> 24:18.792
Yeah.

24:18.825 --> 24:21.061
Okay, she's going to be there
any minute.

24:21.061 --> 24:22.162
Put the phone in your pocket.

24:22.195 --> 24:23.363
I'm gonna tell you
what to say, okay?

24:23.396 --> 24:24.431
Okay.

24:24.464 --> 24:26.499
(woman)
Hello?

24:26.533 --> 24:27.600
Hello?

24:27.634 --> 24:29.369
- Hi, how are you?
- Hey. Hi.

24:29.402 --> 24:31.571
- My name's Heather.
- Hi, I'm Ryan.

24:31.604 --> 24:34.207
Time to improvise.

24:34.240 --> 24:35.575
(R.D.)
This is the kitchen area.

24:35.608 --> 24:37.110
Caesarstone countertops.

24:37.143 --> 24:38.945
You're gonna have
Caesarstone countertops.

24:38.978 --> 24:41.114
Glass backsplash.

24:41.147 --> 24:43.850
Um, we're also going to have
a nice tile backsplash up there.

24:43.883 --> 24:45.452
What kind of marble is this
right here?

24:45.485 --> 24:46.653
Um...

24:46.686 --> 24:49.456
It's like
a $200,000 masonry fireplace.

24:49.489 --> 24:51.458
It's very expensive.

24:52.926 --> 24:55.628
Um, you got a nice little
outside, uh, patio.

24:55.662 --> 24:57.230
It's going to be, you know,
excluded to yourself.

24:57.263 --> 24:58.298
It's a little hard to tell

24:58.331 --> 24:59.733
what the view's gonna look like
in here.

24:59.766 --> 25:01.568
Yeah, I mean,
still a construction site,

25:01.601 --> 25:03.770
so, you know, it's...

25:03.803 --> 25:07.040
No! Don't say it's still
a construction site.

25:07.040 --> 25:09.209
[horns honk in the distance]

25:09.242 --> 25:10.443
R.D., I need you to focus.

25:10.477 --> 25:11.945
I'm trying to sell

25:12.045 --> 25:15.148
a $5-million apartment here.

25:15.181 --> 25:16.683
(R.D.)
And then the bathroom over here.

25:16.716 --> 25:18.551
Wow, this is beautiful.

25:18.585 --> 25:20.653
White Carrara marble.

25:20.687 --> 25:22.222
It's Carrara Marlboro.

25:22.255 --> 25:23.890
Did you say Marlboro?

25:25.291 --> 25:27.460
It's not cigarettes.

25:27.494 --> 25:28.528
It's marble.

25:30.096 --> 25:31.431
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

25:31.464 --> 25:32.899
- Okay.
- Yeah.

25:32.932 --> 25:34.634
(Ryan)
R.D., I realize
you've never done this before,

25:34.668 --> 25:36.569
but you are going
to pull this off.

25:36.603 --> 25:39.205
Actually, I'm going
to pull this off

25:39.239 --> 25:41.107
through your body.

25:41.141 --> 25:43.076
Sell it. Talk to her.
Anything is possible.

25:43.109 --> 25:44.644
She could raise
her family here.

25:44.678 --> 25:46.680
This is really
a family apartment.

25:46.713 --> 25:48.548
You're going to raise
your family here.

25:48.581 --> 25:50.650
And you can have your--it's
a perfect spot for your kids.

25:50.684 --> 25:52.786
The purchase price
is 4.5 million.

25:52.819 --> 25:54.187
It's not even on the market.

25:54.220 --> 25:55.789
She's the first person
to see it.

25:55.822 --> 25:57.357
Purchase price
is 4.5 million.

25:57.390 --> 25:58.992
It's not even on the market,

25:59.092 --> 26:00.326
so you're the first person
to see it.

26:00.360 --> 26:03.463
So if you like it,
we should lock it up

26:03.496 --> 26:05.031
and deal with everything later.

26:05.031 --> 26:07.567
Good boy, good boy.
Sell that sh**. Sell it!

26:07.600 --> 26:08.868
All right, thank you.

26:08.902 --> 26:09.903
Say "thank you."

26:09.936 --> 26:11.705
Thank you very much.

26:11.738 --> 26:13.273
Literally my hair
just got grayer.

26:13.306 --> 26:14.541
Oh, my God.

26:14.574 --> 26:16.209
All right, go set up
the rest of the party.

26:16.242 --> 26:17.777
I'll be there as soon
as I possibly can.

26:17.811 --> 26:20.380
That was awesome.
The Force is with you.

26:20.413 --> 26:21.581
All right, bye.

26:21.614 --> 26:23.416
Oh, my God, I need a drink.

26:25.051 --> 26:28.221
[dramatic music]

26:28.254 --> 26:29.856
Honestly speaking,

26:29.889 --> 26:32.292
these two people have been
very successful with me.

26:32.325 --> 26:35.662
So when she shows concern,
I get concerned.

26:35.695 --> 26:40.233
* *

26:40.266 --> 26:41.468
I understand that you guys

26:41.501 --> 26:43.436
may not be completely
in love with the idea

26:43.470 --> 26:45.071
or that you're not in love
with my idea.

26:45.071 --> 26:48.074
But let's focus
on the most important thing,

26:48.074 --> 26:51.177
which is to get the media
to spread the word

26:51.211 --> 26:53.179
that Cobble Hill
is the place to be.

26:54.180 --> 26:55.949
When everybody wakes up

26:55.982 --> 26:57.183
and goes
to the real estate section,

26:57.217 --> 26:59.919
everybody is talking
about Cobble Hill.

27:00.020 --> 27:02.022
I think there's been
a lot of articles, though,

27:02.022 --> 27:03.857
about how Brooklyn
is the next best thing.

27:03.890 --> 27:05.658
And you don't necessarily
want to look like

27:05.692 --> 27:08.194
you're jumping
on that bandwagon.

27:08.228 --> 27:09.763
(Luis)
Is my whole plan wrong?

27:09.796 --> 27:13.500
Because Laura doesn't like
anything that I'm saying.

27:13.533 --> 27:15.402
I think she's tougher
than Gerard.

27:17.137 --> 27:19.172
But sometimes
that's one article,

27:19.205 --> 27:21.675
and there's a lot of people
that haven't read it.

27:21.708 --> 27:23.143
The idea is to have
that article written

27:23.176 --> 27:25.378
by many publications
at the same time.

27:25.412 --> 27:26.780
Once everybody starts
talking about it,

27:26.813 --> 27:28.848
I am going to blast
this neighborhood

27:28.882 --> 27:31.951
and this last townhouse and
The Townhouses of Cobble Hill

27:32.052 --> 27:33.286
to the rest of the world, to all
my South American connections,

27:33.319 --> 27:34.821
to everybody in Europe,

27:34.854 --> 27:36.356
so that while the articles
are running

27:36.389 --> 27:38.558
and while people are sharing
in social media,

27:38.591 --> 27:40.160
and everybody keeps talking
about Cobble Hill,

27:40.193 --> 27:41.528
Cobble Hill, Cobble Hill--

27:41.561 --> 27:42.729
And now, with the way
the Internet's working,

27:42.762 --> 27:44.731
I want everybody
in this entire planet

27:44.764 --> 27:47.067
to be talking about Cobble Hill.

27:47.100 --> 27:48.501
Buzz creates demand.

27:48.535 --> 27:50.670
Buzz is everything.

27:50.704 --> 27:52.172
When everybody talks
about something,

27:52.205 --> 27:54.074
everybody feels like
they need to know about it.

27:54.074 --> 27:57.077
They'll say, "Hold on,
eight townhouses of this product

27:57.077 --> 27:58.311
"have been sold,
and I didn't know about it.

27:58.345 --> 28:00.080
"Where was I
when these eight townhouses

28:00.113 --> 28:01.481
were all on the market?"

28:01.514 --> 28:03.450
If we get everybody
to think like that,

28:03.483 --> 28:05.385
everybody's going to jump
on that last one.

28:05.418 --> 28:07.287
And that will create demand,
and that will create,

28:07.320 --> 28:09.656
for us to sell it
at asking or over asking.

28:11.491 --> 28:13.026
While it is unique in the way

28:13.026 --> 28:15.428
that most people do a launch
in the beginning,

28:15.462 --> 28:18.331
it's rare that someone would
come out with a relaunch,

28:18.365 --> 28:19.532
in a sense.

28:19.566 --> 28:21.101
And it being geared
toward the press,

28:21.134 --> 28:22.769
it's an interesting twist
to it.

28:25.038 --> 28:26.406
If you could make this happen

28:26.439 --> 28:28.641
and if you are agreeable
to sharing the marketing

28:28.675 --> 28:32.078
and co-list this...

28:32.112 --> 28:35.715
then I'm willing
to offer it to you.

28:35.749 --> 28:37.050
So it's up to you.

28:37.083 --> 28:38.485
I'm in.

28:38.518 --> 28:40.653
- All right.
- I'm in. Thank you so much.

28:40.687 --> 28:44.190
Welcome aboard,
and let's get it out there fast.

28:44.224 --> 28:45.825
I'm excited.

28:47.160 --> 28:48.428
Let's do this.

28:48.461 --> 28:49.729
Let's see what you're able
to do for us.

28:49.763 --> 28:50.830
Okay.

28:50.864 --> 28:52.198
She's tough.

28:52.232 --> 28:53.400
[Laura laughs]

28:53.433 --> 28:54.601
(Ryan)
Coming up...

28:54.634 --> 28:55.935
I realize
that the biggest marketing tool

28:55.969 --> 28:58.905
I've ever had are you guys:
the writers.

28:58.938 --> 29:01.841
I could just feel Laura
waiting for me to f*** it up.

29:01.875 --> 29:03.810
You think they're really
going to write on it tomorrow?

29:09.315 --> 29:12.218
[upbeat music]

29:12.252 --> 29:13.687
What are you--
what are you--

29:13.720 --> 29:15.388
I'm thinking.

29:16.923 --> 29:19.025
I always take off my shoes
when I think,

29:19.059 --> 29:20.560
because I feel like the shoe
is like--

29:20.593 --> 29:23.763
it's almost like a helmet
on the brain.

29:23.797 --> 29:25.031
Can you just think with me?
Think.

29:25.031 --> 29:26.499
All right, let's...

29:26.533 --> 29:27.801
You know,
there's this theory

29:27.834 --> 29:29.869
when you put your heads
close together,

29:29.903 --> 29:32.205
the thought process,
the energy...

29:33.506 --> 29:35.108
You have to take
your shoes off first.

29:36.509 --> 29:38.078
Why are yours
so sweaty?

29:38.111 --> 29:40.313
- I'm a sweaty guy.
- Turn your head down.

29:40.347 --> 29:42.315
No, no, not that long.
Like this.

29:42.349 --> 29:43.883
I'm shorter
than you are.

29:43.917 --> 29:45.218
Okay, there.

29:47.754 --> 29:48.788
Ew.

29:53.259 --> 29:56.930
[upbeat music]

29:56.963 --> 29:59.065
(Ryan)
Just right here. On the right.
On the right. On the right.

29:59.065 --> 30:00.400
- It's--
[tires screech]

30:00.433 --> 30:02.836
Oh, God damn it.

30:02.869 --> 30:04.504
Because East 82nd Street

30:04.537 --> 30:07.407
is currently
very under construction,

30:07.440 --> 30:09.576
we're having the open house
around the corner

30:09.609 --> 30:10.810
at a restaurant.

30:10.844 --> 30:12.645
You all right?

30:12.679 --> 30:14.414
Do you think
she liked it?

30:14.447 --> 30:16.983
I--I hope so.

30:17.017 --> 30:18.218
- Yeah.
- That's crazy.

30:22.088 --> 30:23.590
Okay, that's--
we're done with the analogies.

30:25.792 --> 30:26.993
Hello.

30:27.027 --> 30:28.595
Hey, thanks for coming.

30:28.628 --> 30:30.230
Hello.
Hey, good to see you.

30:30.263 --> 30:31.297
All right.

30:31.331 --> 30:33.133
Just as I expected,

30:33.166 --> 30:35.301
I'm seeing
all of these familiar faces,

30:35.335 --> 30:36.770
and they're all familiar
with Yvonne's work.

30:36.803 --> 30:39.673
So my strategy
is to build anticipation,

30:39.706 --> 30:42.075
make people feel like
they are getting the keys

30:42.108 --> 30:45.211
to the best-kept secret
in the city.

30:46.846 --> 30:48.882
It's six stories.
Only four units.

30:48.915 --> 30:51.084
Three duplexes
and one simplex.

30:51.117 --> 30:52.285
Family-style,
coffered ceilings.

30:52.318 --> 30:53.653
Looks like it's going
to be beautiful.

30:53.687 --> 30:55.355
You look right here,
and it's pure water.

30:55.388 --> 30:56.756
And this is all
82nd Street.

30:56.790 --> 30:58.224
And if you want
to see the mayor,

30:58.258 --> 30:59.893
you can just walk
a block away and be like,

30:59.926 --> 31:02.862
"Yo, Mayor!
It's me, Jason!"

31:08.068 --> 31:09.602
I think R.D. sold
the maisonette.

31:09.636 --> 31:11.838
How--how's that possible?

31:11.871 --> 31:12.839
Things move fast.

31:12.872 --> 31:14.974
He just started,
like, last week.

31:15.075 --> 31:16.676
I don't know
what to tell you.

31:16.710 --> 31:20.180
* *

31:20.213 --> 31:22.415
The launch party
is going awesome.

31:22.449 --> 31:23.817
I'll show you
the brochure.

31:23.850 --> 31:25.352
It's similar
to residence three.

31:25.385 --> 31:28.088
But obviously brochures
and floor plans

31:28.088 --> 31:29.522
can really only go so far.

31:29.556 --> 31:33.193
So we're doing tours of
the building every 30 minutes.

31:33.226 --> 31:35.095
The advantage to being
right around the corner

31:35.095 --> 31:38.365
is that I can take people
over to the building all night.

31:38.398 --> 31:40.200
Everyone follow me.

31:40.233 --> 31:42.102
A property is kind of like
a car.

31:42.102 --> 31:43.937
Even though the pictures
may be great...

31:43.970 --> 31:45.705
We're walking,
we're walking.

31:45.739 --> 31:47.841
Chances are,
you're not going to buy it

31:47.874 --> 31:50.744
without getting
behind the wheel.

31:50.777 --> 31:52.712
So here we are.

31:52.746 --> 31:55.181
* *

31:56.883 --> 31:58.551
Just like 63rd Street,
these developers really,

31:58.585 --> 31:59.819
really pay attention
to detail.

31:59.853 --> 32:01.454
So you've got crown moldings.

32:01.488 --> 32:02.756
You've got
built-in speakers.

32:02.789 --> 32:04.824
Every single apartment
is fully wired.

32:04.858 --> 32:07.327
Everyone liking that bathroom?

32:07.360 --> 32:08.461
Yeah?

32:10.330 --> 32:12.799
(Ryan)
It's a party shower.

32:12.832 --> 32:14.734
There's radiant heat flooring
under every single floor.

32:14.768 --> 32:16.770
$200,000 masonry fireplace.

32:16.803 --> 32:18.138
Gas- and wood-burning.

32:18.171 --> 32:19.806
It's a bisexual fireplace.

32:20.807 --> 32:21.808
So far, so good.

32:23.743 --> 32:25.345
Just over 2,300 square feet.

32:25.378 --> 32:27.480
This is your entire
master bedroom suite.

32:27.514 --> 32:30.417
All the bedrooms upstairs and
all the living space downstairs.

32:30.450 --> 32:32.852
- It's pretty much like a house.
- [laughs]

32:32.886 --> 32:35.121
All right, you want to go back
and get food? Let's do it.

32:35.155 --> 32:37.257
* *

32:37.290 --> 32:40.260
- So what's the feedback like?
- Uh, wait a minute.

32:43.096 --> 32:44.731
We just sold
the maisonette.

32:44.764 --> 32:46.099
No way.
Are you serious?

32:46.099 --> 32:48.101
You have a full ask offer

32:48.101 --> 32:50.837
on the maisonette
that R.D. walked them through?

32:50.870 --> 32:52.672
I don't believe it.

32:52.706 --> 32:54.908
Hey, R.D.
Come here.

32:54.941 --> 32:56.142
What's up?

32:57.844 --> 32:59.112
"Ryan Serhant,

32:59.112 --> 33:00.246
"on behalf of my wife
and myself,

33:00.280 --> 33:01.614
"we would like to offer
a full price offer

33:01.648 --> 33:04.451
for the maisonette."

33:04.484 --> 33:05.685
You sold the maisonette!

33:05.719 --> 33:08.054
- Ha-ha! Yes!
- Go, R.D. Go, R.D.!

33:08.054 --> 33:11.391
Everything I touch literally
turns to awesomeness...

33:11.424 --> 33:13.126
Aren't you excited?

33:13.159 --> 33:15.061
Even my little apprentice.

33:15.095 --> 33:16.796
- How did you do that?
- I don't know.

33:18.064 --> 33:19.566
That's crazy.
That's one of four.

33:19.599 --> 33:21.368
So now we're 25% sold.

33:21.401 --> 33:24.104
(Yvonne)
That is amazing.

33:24.137 --> 33:29.275
* *

33:29.309 --> 33:31.544
- Is that the last one?
- Yes.

33:31.578 --> 33:32.612
All right.

33:32.645 --> 33:33.880
The Townhouses of Cobble Hill

33:33.913 --> 33:34.914
is not yet built.

33:34.948 --> 33:36.549
Oh, look at that meat.

33:36.583 --> 33:38.752
I don't want the media wearing
hard hats and, you know,

33:38.785 --> 33:41.521
all dusty and get all dirty
and all that kind of stuff.

33:41.554 --> 33:43.723
I want them to sit down,
enjoy nice food,

33:43.757 --> 33:44.858
listen to nice music.

33:44.891 --> 33:46.359
This feels like Brooklyn.

33:48.161 --> 33:50.630
With that good vibe,
they can feel inspired

33:50.663 --> 33:53.266
about what this project will be

33:53.299 --> 33:55.535
so that they can write about it
in the best way possible.

33:57.737 --> 33:58.738
Good to see you.
Pleasure.

33:58.772 --> 34:00.707
- Hello.
- Hi, how are you?

34:00.740 --> 34:02.208
This event's
about the entire neighborhood.

34:02.242 --> 34:03.276
- How are you?
- Good to see you.

34:03.309 --> 34:04.678
That's the reason I invited

34:04.711 --> 34:08.548
fashion writers, art writers,
food critics, historians--

34:08.581 --> 34:11.051
everything that has to do
with a neighborhood.

34:14.821 --> 34:16.156
It's very risky
what I'm doing,

34:16.189 --> 34:18.058
because media,
you cannot control.

34:18.058 --> 34:19.793
Media can go either way.

34:19.826 --> 34:21.795
If I do it great,
it'll be amazing.

34:21.828 --> 34:25.131
If I don't,
then not only I'm f***ed,

34:25.165 --> 34:28.134
but everybody involved
in the project is f***ed.

34:30.403 --> 34:31.738
- [laughs]
- Right?

34:31.771 --> 34:32.772
Fingers crossed. Yeah.

34:34.441 --> 34:36.376
All right, guys, uh,

34:36.409 --> 34:37.911
I'm very big on marketing.

34:37.944 --> 34:41.147
And I realize that the biggest
marketing tool I've ever had

34:41.181 --> 34:43.616
are you guys:
the writers.

34:43.650 --> 34:46.086
You've written about deals
that I've made in the past,

34:46.086 --> 34:48.555
people that I've represented.

34:48.588 --> 34:51.458
Speaking of, Gerard Longo,
developer here, everybody.

34:51.491 --> 34:53.259
- Hello, everyone. Good evening.
- Laura, how are you?

34:53.293 --> 34:56.129
Joe. Welcome, welcome.

34:56.162 --> 34:57.697
Okay.

34:57.731 --> 34:58.832
[laughs]

35:01.034 --> 35:02.435
So, um...

35:04.170 --> 35:06.139
Yeah, so back--
where was I with you?

35:07.407 --> 35:09.342
[claps]
Um, okay, so yes.

35:09.376 --> 35:12.412
My first order of business is to
reach the international market.

35:12.445 --> 35:14.214
I want to let them know
that they're missing out

35:14.247 --> 35:15.415
on something that's special.

35:15.448 --> 35:17.083
Every other neighborhood
in Manhattan

35:17.117 --> 35:18.451
is becoming overpopulated.

35:21.821 --> 35:24.324
You have about 150,000
of Instagram followers.

35:24.357 --> 35:25.725
You got about
350,000 followers.

35:25.759 --> 35:29.129
I want you guys to help me sell
this townhouse for $15 million.

35:29.162 --> 35:30.230
[all laugh]

35:30.263 --> 35:32.265
The speech went great.

35:32.298 --> 35:34.234
Thank you so much for coming.

35:34.267 --> 35:35.602
Now I am going to do
what I do best,

35:35.635 --> 35:38.071
which is work the room.

35:38.071 --> 35:40.073
People love a neighborhood
with good restaurants.

35:40.106 --> 35:41.741
That drives everybody.

35:41.775 --> 35:44.177
I'm going to give you
a personal list

35:44.210 --> 35:45.845
of all the best restaurants
on Smith Street.

35:45.879 --> 35:47.781
The terrace
looks over Manhattan.

35:48.915 --> 35:50.550
And it comes
with a guitar player.

35:50.583 --> 35:51.618
[laughs]

35:51.651 --> 35:53.086
It's amazing.

35:53.119 --> 35:57.090
Do you ever get the feeling
that you're being watched?

35:57.090 --> 35:58.525
It's true 19th-century living.

35:58.558 --> 36:00.293
Everything is
mom-and-pop shops.

36:00.326 --> 36:03.630
I could just feel Laura
waiting for me to f*** it up

36:03.663 --> 36:06.066
so that she can fire me.

36:06.099 --> 36:07.767
- Gerard Longo.
- Hi, Gerard.

36:07.801 --> 36:09.803
- Catherine, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

36:10.804 --> 36:12.038
Thank you.
We're very proud of it.

36:14.040 --> 36:15.041
Absolutely.

36:15.041 --> 36:16.543
- Love this energy.
- Very good.

36:16.576 --> 36:19.145
[indistinct chatter]

36:19.179 --> 36:21.081
Sorry to interrupt.
Can I borrow you for a minute?

36:21.114 --> 36:23.183
Yeah. One second, please.
Be right back.

36:25.452 --> 36:27.053
What do you think
of the turnout?

36:27.087 --> 36:28.822
I think it's great.
I think everybody's enjoying it.

36:28.855 --> 36:30.757
I think the food
is incredible.

36:30.790 --> 36:32.092
I think
it looks pretty good.

36:32.125 --> 36:34.127
You think they're really
going to write on it tomorrow?

36:36.363 --> 36:38.198
Why don't you trust me?

36:38.231 --> 36:39.666
Well, I mean,
this is our baby.

36:39.699 --> 36:41.067
We want to see you
do it right.

36:41.067 --> 36:43.570
I understand completely
where Laura is coming from.

36:43.603 --> 36:47.140
I'm the new guy on the team.
She has to protect the project.

36:47.173 --> 36:49.442
But she needs
to work with me.

36:49.476 --> 36:50.610
I come here
to be a team player.

36:50.643 --> 36:51.978
I have incredible value.

36:52.078 --> 36:54.280
I just need you to allow me
to prove that.

36:54.314 --> 36:55.915
Just bring me a contract.

36:55.949 --> 36:57.650
Okay.
Can you trust me, please?

36:57.684 --> 36:59.352
(Laura)
We'll see.

36:59.386 --> 37:01.454
We'll be reading papers
tomorrow.

37:01.488 --> 37:05.759
* *

37:05.792 --> 37:07.460
Okay, okay, okay.

37:07.494 --> 37:09.095
Thank God.

37:09.129 --> 37:10.730
My developers,
Jared and Thomas,

37:10.764 --> 37:13.366
finally decided
on the finishes.

37:13.400 --> 37:16.069
And although it wasn't
exactly what I wanted,

37:16.102 --> 37:17.470
they're still beautiful.

37:17.504 --> 37:20.640
They're high end
and top of the line.

37:20.674 --> 37:22.609
However,
the installation of them

37:22.642 --> 37:24.277
will take a few more months.

37:24.310 --> 37:25.612
But I'm not going to wait.

37:25.645 --> 37:28.381
That's why I started scheduling
showings right away.

37:28.415 --> 37:30.283
Actually, now.

37:30.316 --> 37:32.786
Hi. Fredrik.
What a beautiful day.

37:32.819 --> 37:34.421
- Hey, how are you?
- Mwah.

37:34.454 --> 37:36.456
I love
a tall, beautiful buyer.

37:36.489 --> 37:38.091
I love
a tall, handsome broker.

37:38.124 --> 37:39.292
[woman laughs]

37:39.325 --> 37:40.894
As you can see,
the whole house is laid out.

37:40.927 --> 37:43.063
Fireplace, mechanical,
central AC.

37:43.063 --> 37:45.498
But what's lacking here
are the finishes.

37:45.532 --> 37:47.801
- Are there any renderings?
- I'm glad you asked.

37:47.834 --> 37:50.070
I love all parts
of real estate, I really do.

37:50.070 --> 37:51.438
I'm obsessed.

37:51.471 --> 37:55.141
But what excites me the most,
after all these years,

37:55.175 --> 37:57.177
sometimes you got to think
creatively

37:57.210 --> 38:01.014
just like no one else
could ever imagine.

38:01.014 --> 38:02.716
- This is genius.
- How so?

38:02.749 --> 38:04.918
We find the manufacturer
of these.

38:05.018 --> 38:06.319
We print all our renderings--

38:06.353 --> 38:09.322
master, master bath,
the garden--on these.

38:09.356 --> 38:10.523
This is the future.

38:10.557 --> 38:14.461
Get me 300
with all the renderings printed.

38:14.494 --> 38:16.863
- This is for you.
- Oh, great.

38:16.896 --> 38:18.198
A viewfinder.

38:18.231 --> 38:19.666
- Oh.
- Look in here.

38:19.699 --> 38:22.602
One, two, three.
Click.

38:22.635 --> 38:24.137
(woman)
Oh, wow.

38:24.170 --> 38:25.505
- How beautiful is that?
- That's beautiful.

38:25.538 --> 38:27.107
And the floors,
are they herringbone?

38:27.140 --> 38:29.042
- Yes.
- That is gorgeous!

38:29.075 --> 38:31.077
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Ooh, I love the beam ceilings.

38:31.111 --> 38:33.813
I mean, this is hilarious.

38:33.847 --> 38:38.051
These brokers are looking up,
and they're looking down.

38:38.051 --> 38:39.119
It's just a few renderings.

38:39.152 --> 38:40.220
You don't need
to look down or up.

38:40.253 --> 38:43.089
But they are so immersed
in the picture

38:43.123 --> 38:44.624
that they just can't help it.

38:44.657 --> 38:46.259
What about the fireplace?

38:46.292 --> 38:47.827
- Is that marble?
- Mm-hmm.

38:47.861 --> 38:48.862
Wow.

38:50.797 --> 38:53.633
(Fredrik)
And click. Click. Click.

38:53.667 --> 38:55.669
I love how high the countertops
are in the kitchen.

38:55.702 --> 38:58.371
Don't you just want to step
into that little machine

38:58.405 --> 38:59.673
- and just live in there?
- Yes.

38:59.706 --> 39:01.408
I mean, you can
for 22 1/2 million.

39:01.441 --> 39:03.843
* *

39:03.877 --> 39:05.045
(woman)
Oh, yeah.

39:05.078 --> 39:06.279
Oh, yeah, honey.

39:06.312 --> 39:07.681
Look at the shower.
Look at the tiles.

39:07.714 --> 39:09.382
Oh, no, no.
No, the other way.

39:09.416 --> 39:10.717
- Like that.
- Oh, sorry.

39:10.750 --> 39:12.018
That's okay.

39:12.018 --> 39:13.720
- Oh, wow.
- Wow.

39:13.753 --> 39:15.622
(woman)
The finishes are remarkable.

39:15.655 --> 39:18.024
This is why I got these.
Everything will be perfect.

39:18.024 --> 39:19.759
I must ask you, though,
so this--

39:19.793 --> 39:22.462
you're asking almost 3,200
a foot for this house, correct?

39:22.495 --> 39:24.297
I know, it's too inexpensive.
I should have priced it--

39:24.330 --> 39:25.498
Inexpensive?

39:25.532 --> 39:27.801
[suspenseful music]

39:27.834 --> 39:28.935
Well, what do you think
it's worth?

39:29.035 --> 39:30.370
Somewhere in the high teens.

39:30.403 --> 39:31.671
With these finishes?

39:34.341 --> 39:37.177
(Fredrik)
Even the best renderings
only go so far.

39:37.210 --> 39:38.878
It's clear to me now
that people want to see

39:38.912 --> 39:41.581
the finished product before
they actually pull the trigger

39:41.614 --> 39:43.416
on something this expensive.

39:43.450 --> 39:45.618
You think it's going to be sold
at 22 1/2 million?

39:45.652 --> 39:48.054
You always have the right
to negotiate.

39:48.054 --> 39:49.422
I know these developers,

39:49.456 --> 39:53.093
and they're not going to accept
anything below full ask.

39:53.126 --> 39:55.061
It's like this, 22.5.

39:55.061 --> 39:57.297
22.5.

39:57.330 --> 39:58.565
But if that's what they want...

40:00.533 --> 40:01.701
They're going to have
to be patient.

40:01.735 --> 40:03.903
And, unfortunately,

40:03.937 --> 40:05.772
so am I.

40:05.805 --> 40:07.640
One, two, three.

40:10.810 --> 40:12.012
(Ryan)
Coming up...

40:12.045 --> 40:13.546
If I'm going to propose,

40:13.580 --> 40:14.981
then it's going to be a proposal
that she'll never forget.

40:15.015 --> 40:16.516
This is absolute chaos.

40:21.554 --> 40:25.291
[upbeat music]

40:25.325 --> 40:26.493
(Ryan)
Look at this.

40:26.526 --> 40:28.795
Isn't this awesome?

40:30.530 --> 40:32.999
I love big.

40:33.033 --> 40:35.035
Big cars,

40:35.068 --> 40:37.737
big buildings,
big commissions.

40:37.771 --> 40:40.106
I want a big proposal.

40:40.140 --> 40:41.374
All of this will be gone.

40:41.408 --> 40:42.809
We're going to move
all these tables.

40:42.842 --> 40:43.810
All these people.

40:43.843 --> 40:46.112
Do you hear that?

40:46.146 --> 40:47.380
Nothing.

40:47.414 --> 40:50.917
That is what I want
Times Square to sound like.

40:50.950 --> 40:52.218
I'll have to think
of something.

40:52.252 --> 40:53.420
I'll leave it, like,
into my body

40:53.453 --> 40:57.090
and then I'll just be like,
do you, R.D....

40:57.123 --> 41:00.293
- Oh, God.
- [laughs]

41:00.326 --> 41:01.895
(Ryan)
You always hear that saying

41:01.928 --> 41:04.497
that when you find the one,
you'll know it.

41:04.531 --> 41:06.132
- [laughs]
- Just follow my lead.

41:06.166 --> 41:09.302
Now grab my shoulder.
I'm going to dip you like this.

41:09.336 --> 41:10.637
And for most
of my adult life,

41:10.670 --> 41:13.440
I didn't really
believe that

41:13.473 --> 41:16.242
until I met Emilia.

41:16.276 --> 41:18.578
I think what made
the difference, for me,

41:18.611 --> 41:22.082
was that I immediately knew
that, no matter what,

41:22.082 --> 41:25.852
we would make each other laugh
until the day that we die.

41:25.885 --> 41:27.187
Do you think
I could do this?

41:27.220 --> 41:29.255
No, this is absolute chaos.

41:31.358 --> 41:33.159
Right now it's absolute chaos.

41:33.193 --> 41:34.828
- Right now it's Times Square.
- It's like this all the time.

41:34.861 --> 41:36.529
You've been out
at 2:00 in the morning.

41:36.563 --> 41:38.598
- Not really.
- This place is crazy.

41:38.631 --> 41:39.966
Are you here at 2:00
in the morning?

41:40.000 --> 41:41.668
- Sometimes.
- Yeah, I'm sure.

41:41.701 --> 41:43.803
R.D., you can't be negative.

41:43.837 --> 41:46.172
I'm going to shut down
Times Square.

41:46.206 --> 41:49.376
R.D., you should say,
"Hell, yes, you are."

41:49.409 --> 41:53.380
This is going to be a proposal
that she'll never forget.

41:53.413 --> 41:56.182
Let's do this.
Let's shut down Times Square.

41:58.251 --> 42:00.253
- All right, let's go.
- Let's do it.

42:04.324 --> 42:05.959

42:16.136 --> 42:18.204
This is the kind of project

I'm your broker, bitch.

This property itself
is 60 million.

Can I still call you
Ricky Ricardo?

42:26.212 --> 42:28.314
- What is the sellout here?
- $300 million.

42:28.348 --> 42:30.750
There's nothing else
that I want more than this.

42:30.784 --> 42:32.786
- I think you're full of sh**.
- Are you f***ing crazy?

42:32.819 --> 42:34.888
I just got you $10 million.

42:34.921 --> 42:37.357
What is it you don't understand?
It's a record price.

42:37.390 --> 42:39.125
You have one week.

42:39.159 --> 42:40.593
Listen to reason, mother****er.
Let's go.

Have you found a mother?

I don't want to give up

42:48.368 --> 42:49.536
on the question

42:49.569 --> 42:51.971
I want to be, like, so great,

42:52.005 --> 42:53.707
and I have the ability.
