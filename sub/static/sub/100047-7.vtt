Rule number two: when you go out,
you keep yourselves to yourselves.

If anyone you don't know asks you
to go somewhere, you say no.

04:14.160 --> 04:16.720

You wouldn't want anyone
finding out about this, would you?

09:24.960 --> 09:27.920

more than enough chances, man.

18:37.280 --> 18:39.240
I'm assuming you have something for me.

- It's all there.
- Good.

18:55.120 --> 18:56.160
So what?

18:56.800 --> 18:57.880
Strictly business, yeah?

19:02.800 --> 19:04.560
You was telling me about your brother,

19:04.640 --> 19:05.880
the one who got kneecapped.

19:06.440 --> 19:07.640
How does that work again?

19:09.520 --> 19:11.400
Well, it depends on your objective.

19:12.040 --> 19:14.440
Do you wanna cripple someone
or just teach them a lesson?

19:15.840 --> 19:16.960
Second one.

19:19.240 --> 19:21.040
Then what you have to do is this.

19:23.360 --> 19:25.400
First, you have to get him
to take off his trousers.

19:25.480 --> 19:26.720
- What?
- Mm.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.240
It's for his own good.

19:28.320 --> 19:31.640
You get fabric fibres into the wound,
and then he ends up with an infection.

19:32.200 --> 19:34.360
Then you take your gun,
small calibre pistol,

19:34.440 --> 19:37.120
nothin' too punchy,
and you put the barrel here,

19:37.800 --> 19:41.360
into the fleshy part of the thigh,
away from the bone,

19:42.920 --> 19:44.680
and you don't wanna nick an artery.

19:45.400 --> 19:47.200
One clean shot, straight through.

19:48.360 --> 19:49.880
I mean, he'll feel it all right,

19:50.760 --> 19:52.560
but it won't do any permanent damage.

32:36.040 --> 32:37.160
Can you do that?

32:38.240 --> 32:39.280
Yeah, I got this.

32:53.040 --> 32:55.200
Yo, make sure Leyton
gets that message, innit?

33:06.480 --> 33:07.480
You wanna race me?

33:07.560 --> 33:09.040
- No, man.
- Oh, you got shook.

33:09.520 --> 33:11.400
- You got shook, innit?
- You're excited.

33:11.960 --> 33:12.800

33:13.480 --> 33:15.560
[in Manchester accent]
Got to get this money from Jaq,

33:15.920 --> 33:17.160

33:18.320 --> 33:20.600
Are you laughing?
That's what the people in Manchester say.

33:20.680 --> 33:23.440
- Hey, that accent's bare funny, fam.
- You know, funny accents like that.

33:23.520 --> 33:25.720
Aight, everything's calm,
'cause Aaron thinks I'm at yours.

33:25.800 --> 33:26.640
You know?

33:28.320 --> 33:29.600
Well done, bro.

33:31.640 --> 33:33.800
Hey, hold up, bro. Desperate for a piss.

33:40.760 --> 33:42.760
[indistinct chatter in background]

34:01.200 --> 34:03.520

34:11.840 --> 34:13.840
[ominous music playing]

34:16.400 --> 34:18.440
- [Jaq] What's your name again?
- S-Stef.

34:20.520 --> 34:21.360
And what happened?

34:21.800 --> 34:24.400
We went like you told us to.
We met the guy, he gave us the bag.

34:24.480 --> 34:26.840
- We came straight back.
- ...after he pissed on the wall.

34:26.920 --> 34:27.800
[scoffs]

34:28.719 --> 34:30.760
So what happened to the bag, then?
Where is it?

34:36.880 --> 34:38.400
Go on! Speak up, then!

34:41.760 --> 34:44.000
So this guy come out of nowhere.

34:44.400 --> 34:45.600
He grabbed the bag.

34:45.960 --> 34:48.719
- We tried to stop him, serious.
- [Stefan] He pushed me against the wall.

34:49.400 --> 34:51.159
But he just grabbed it and ran off.

34:53.560 --> 34:55.480
Which one of youse two
was holding the bag, then?

35:01.640 --> 35:02.480
Me.

35:04.320 --> 35:06.040
[Ats] I was the one holding the bag.

35:12.240 --> 35:13.760
So what does this guy look like?

35:14.480 --> 35:15.600
I don't know.

35:16.680 --> 35:18.080
[Ats] I didn't see his face.

35:20.560 --> 35:25.040
He was wearing some sort of...
a hood thingy.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
And it was dark.

35:28.320 --> 35:29.160
[tsks]

35:31.000 --> 35:33.480
- So you twos lost our Ps, yeah?

35:33.560 --> 35:35.960
I don't wanna hear

35:36.240 --> 35:37.080
Fuck!

35:41.040 --> 35:44.400
All right, listen. Youse two,

35:44.680 --> 35:46.160
You hear what I'm sayin' to you, bruv?

35:46.240 --> 35:48.000
You ain't gonna say nothin'
to your friends.

35:48.080 --> 35:50.680
Nothin' to your family. No one at school.

35:52.200 --> 35:54.240
Youse two are gonna have to
make shit right.

35:54.600 --> 35:56.680
Do you understand
what I'm sayin' to you, bruv?

35:57.200 --> 35:58.240
Are you hearin' me?

35:58.320 --> 36:00.040
- Are you fuckin' listening, blud?
- [Stefan winces]

36:00.280 --> 36:01.480
[tsks] Get out!

36:02.080 --> 36:03.520
Get the fuck out!

36:05.480 --> 36:07.240
[door opens, shuts]

36:07.640 --> 36:08.680
[sighs]

36:10.560 --> 36:12.600
I feel sorry for them, you know. [tsks]

36:12.680 --> 36:13.600
[Dushane] Nah, man.

36:13.960 --> 36:15.120
Don't worry about that.

36:16.120 --> 36:17.080
You lot did good.

36:18.440 --> 36:20.000
Tell your boy Craig I owe him one, yeah?

36:21.560 --> 36:24.320
- So what are you gonna do with them?
- I don't even know.

36:25.240 --> 36:28.200
But having Jamie's little brother in
our back pocket ain't gonna hurt, is it?

36:28.280 --> 36:30.320
They ain't gonna say nothin' to Jamie,
are they?

36:30.400 --> 36:32.480
Listen, they ain't sayin' shit to no one.

36:33.480 --> 36:36.120
Furthermore, same goes for you two, yeah?

36:36.760 --> 36:37.920
No one hears about this.

36:40.480 --> 36:41.520
All right, I'm gone.

36:50.920 --> 36:52.000
Hey, Jaq.

36:53.080 --> 36:54.960
What you want me to do with this?

36:56.720 --> 36:58.600
[Jaq] I can't believe
they didn't see it was you.

36:59.280 --> 37:00.320
[Jaq chuckles]

37:44.680 --> 37:45.800
[floorboard creaks]

37:47.840 --> 37:48.800
Where have you been?

37:49.720 --> 37:52.680
Jamie's gonna go mad if he finds out
you've been out this late, man.

37:56.440 --> 37:57.480
[Aaron] Whoa.

37:58.360 --> 37:59.360
What's the matter?

37:59.680 --> 38:00.640
Nothin'.

38:00.720 --> 38:02.360
[tsks] Tell me what's goin' on, Stef, man.

38:02.440 --> 38:04.240
[sighs] Please don't tell Jamie.

38:05.000 --> 38:05.840
Please.

38:09.040 --> 38:10.040
[sighs]

38:13.840 --> 38:14.800
All right.

38:16.120 --> 38:17.600
But just this once.

38:26.040 --> 38:27.040
[Aaron sighs]

38:31.560 --> 38:32.520
[Stefan] Aaron?

38:36.200 --> 38:37.160
Yeah?

38:37.400 --> 38:38.800
What does Jamie do?

38:39.760 --> 38:40.600
For a job?

38:41.040 --> 38:42.520
Why are you asking me that?

38:47.240 --> 38:48.080
Is it illegal?

38:50.760 --> 38:51.600
No.

38:52.880 --> 38:54.440
Jamie don't do nothin' like that.

38:55.120 --> 38:56.120
All right?

38:56.600 --> 38:57.840
Get some sleep, yeah?

39:06.040 --> 39:06.880
[sighs]

39:06.960 --> 39:08.960
[melancholy ambient music playing]

39:54.320 --> 39:57.120
We've been looking for
these pussyhole youts all day, yeah?

39:57.200 --> 39:58.600
And we ain't found nobody.

39:59.280 --> 40:01.400
- Let's just call it a day, man.
- Call it...

40:02.880 --> 40:04.040
Call it a what?

40:05.680 --> 40:07.400
But we ain't fuckin' done shit.

40:09.800 --> 40:11.080
These fuckin'... [tsks]

40:11.160 --> 40:12.400
We ain't goin' home.

40:13.960 --> 40:16.440
[Farah] Why don't you listen
to anything Jamie tells you?

40:16.520 --> 40:19.800
[Leyton] What are you talkin' about?
Fuck Jamie.

40:19.880 --> 40:21.680
[Farah] Who was you talkin' to, Leyton?

40:21.760 --> 40:22.920
[Leyton] Ay, fuck that.

40:23.080 --> 40:24.440
[Leyton groans]

40:27.000 --> 40:28.760
[Tyrone] Oh, you'd speak up, brother.

40:37.080 --> 40:38.480
[panting]

40:40.680 --> 40:42.640
I wasn't talkin' to no one.

40:42.720 --> 40:44.840
What do you mean
you weren't talkin' to no one?

40:44.920 --> 40:47.480
I saw you, blud. You and Cornell.

40:48.480 --> 40:50.560
What are you talkin' about?
That was nothing.

40:50.640 --> 40:54.200
- [stammers] We were just talkin'.
- Make up your fuckin' mind, cuz.

40:54.280 --> 40:56.840
Was you talkin' or was you not?

40:59.240 --> 41:01.680
- Ay, fuck you, man.
- Take down your trousers, fam.

41:01.760 --> 41:03.640
What? Why?

41:04.400 --> 41:06.600
- I ain't taking down no damn...
- It's for your own good, dickhead!

41:06.920 --> 41:09.800
Listen to what I'm sayin',
or you're gettin' a bullet in the head.

41:12.360 --> 41:15.000
Oh, you know what? Fuck all of you!

41:17.640 --> 41:18.600
Fuck you!

41:22.160 --> 41:23.120
All right.

41:24.080 --> 41:25.760
If that's how you wanna do it.

41:28.720 --> 41:30.160
[shivering breaths]

41:38.320 --> 41:39.800
- [Leyton yells in pain]
- [Si] Grab him.

41:39.880 --> 41:42.000
[Leyton] Get off me! What are you doin'?

41:42.080 --> 41:44.520
- [Leyton groans]
- Look, behave yourself, fam.

41:45.160 --> 41:48.200
- [Tyrone] Put the gun in the fleshy part.
- Don't you fuckin' shoot me, fam.

41:48.280 --> 41:49.960
[Farah] Hey, stay still, dickhead!

41:50.040 --> 41:52.120
- [Tyrone] Don't shoot me, fam.
- [Si] Fuckin' shoot him!

41:52.200 --> 41:54.280
- [Farah] Is that the right place, fam?
- Shoot him. Yes.

41:54.360 --> 41:55.800
- [Farah] Hold him still, man.
- [Leyton] No!

41:55.880 --> 41:57.960
[Farah] Shut up! Don't make this harder
than it needs to be!

41:58.040 --> 41:59.400
- [gunshot]
- [Leyton screams]

41:59.480 --> 42:00.440
- Fuck!
- Shit!

42:00.520 --> 42:03.000
- Oh, shit!
- [screaming continues]

42:03.720 --> 42:05.360
[Farah] Fuck me.

42:05.440 --> 42:07.360
Oh, fuck!

42:07.760 --> 42:08.760
[screams]

42:08.840 --> 42:12.200
Hey, that's a lot of blood, you know.
Is it supposed to be bleedin' that much?

42:12.280 --> 42:14.960
How am I supposed to know, fam?
I ain't done this before!

42:15.040 --> 42:17.360
I don't think it's meant
to look like that, you know.

42:17.440 --> 42:20.480
- Fuckin' hell. What do we do?
- [screaming continues]

42:20.560 --> 42:22.280
Well, should we try and stop the blood?

42:22.760 --> 42:24.840
Bruv, go ahead and do it
if you want to, man.

42:24.920 --> 42:26.120
- Who? Me?
- Yes, you!

42:26.200 --> 42:27.920
It was your idea in the first place, yeah?

42:28.000 --> 42:30.280
[Tyrone] Do I look like
a fuckin' doctor to you?

42:30.480 --> 42:32.200
I don't want his blood all over me.

42:32.280 --> 42:33.600
[Leyton struggles to breathe]

42:33.680 --> 42:35.000
Are you all right, fam?

42:36.440 --> 42:37.280
[whimpers]

42:38.320 --> 42:39.280
[grunts]

42:44.440 --> 42:45.480
[Farah] Fuck me.

42:45.880 --> 42:47.400
[Si] He's bleeding out, fam.

42:47.480 --> 42:48.720
[Tyrone] This is bad.

42:48.800 --> 42:51.280
- [Farah] Shit, shit, shit.
- [Tyrone] What we gonna do?

42:52.680 --> 42:54.680
[tense music playing]

43:26.760 --> 43:29.400
Hey, yo.
The kids found him again, you know.

43:29.480 --> 43:30.600
They're close.

43:49.880 --> 43:50.800
Oi!

43:51.480 --> 43:52.880
You know me or something?

43:57.960 --> 43:58.960
[tyres screeching]

43:59.800 --> 44:00.640
[gunshot]

44:01.600 --> 44:02.680
Oh, shit!

44:09.640 --> 44:10.600
[gunshot]

44:11.720 --> 44:12.640
[grumbles]

44:12.720 --> 44:13.680
Fuck.

44:14.200 --> 44:15.120
Oi!

44:19.560 --> 44:21.040
[car horn honking in quick bursts]

44:21.120 --> 44:23.120
[panting]

44:30.640 --> 44:32.360
[honking resumes]

44:50.360 --> 44:52.640
Yes, fam! Fuck's sake!

44:52.960 --> 44:54.360
[Kit] Fam, who did you hit?

44:54.440 --> 44:56.200
- [mobile phone vibrating]
- [Kit] Who was that?

44:59.000 --> 44:59.960
Yo.

45:02.040 --> 45:03.080
What?

45:09.080 --> 45:10.440
Blud, what do we do?

45:11.120 --> 45:12.360
What do we tell people?

45:12.880 --> 45:14.120
What do we tell Modie?

45:20.920 --> 45:22.560
This was payback from Summerhouse.

45:23.840 --> 45:26.240
They killed Leyton
'cause Leyton tried to kill Sully.

45:27.360 --> 45:28.200
All right?

45:30.440 --> 45:31.920
That's the story we're goin' with.

45:36.360 --> 45:37.360
Follow.

45:53.440 --> 45:55.160
[car doors shutting]

45:57.600 --> 45:58.480
[tsks]

46:26.680 --> 46:28.120
Are we gonna have a problem?

46:30.760 --> 46:32.040
[Haze] About the cripple boy?

46:35.240 --> 46:36.160
No.

46:38.920 --> 46:39.920
Good.

46:41.120 --> 46:43.120
'Cause you need to know
I done you a big favour.

46:45.320 --> 46:47.160
Sugar wanted that boy to suffer.

46:47.720 --> 46:49.000
Suffer long time.

46:50.320 --> 46:52.560
But I said,
'Sugar, it was Dushane fucked up.

46:53.200 --> 46:55.320
He told that boy to hide, so...

46:56.000 --> 46:57.040
do him quick.'

46:59.040 --> 47:00.240
So that's what he did.

47:03.440 --> 47:05.880
Them youts got hit on the road
the other night, they yours?

47:05.960 --> 47:07.440
I don't know what the fuck
you're talkin' about.

47:07.720 --> 47:10.040
I'm talkin' about the bodies
all over the road.

47:10.120 --> 47:13.960
Are they yours or ZTs?
'Cause I'm hearin' Jamie's fuckin' you up.

47:14.040 --> 47:16.280
Jamie ain't fuckin' no one up, bruv.

47:16.360 --> 47:17.440
So you've been sellin'?

47:18.040 --> 47:19.280
You're makin' your Ps?

47:26.040 --> 47:27.160
You know what?

47:28.560 --> 47:30.480
I'm tired of having this conversation.

47:31.320 --> 47:33.360
Every time, it's the same bloodclaat ting.

47:33.440 --> 47:35.520
You're gonna tell me again,
you need more time?

47:37.080 --> 47:38.520
'Cause that will just make me angry.

47:39.520 --> 47:40.920
I need more time.

47:45.640 --> 47:48.640
- You think I wouldn't kill you right here?
- Well, fuckin' do it, then.

47:50.240 --> 47:51.120
Kill me.

47:54.400 --> 47:57.360
Then you can call Sugar and tell him why
he ain't gettin' his fuckin' money.

47:58.960 --> 48:00.720
Next time I call and say to meet,

48:01.960 --> 48:04.000
you need to tell me
you've been makin' your Ps.

48:06.000 --> 48:07.000
'Cause if you don't,

48:08.360 --> 48:10.640
I will kill that cute girl
you been seeing.

48:11.800 --> 48:13.160
I will kill her child.

48:13.920 --> 48:15.240
I will kill your brother.

48:15.480 --> 48:17.240
I will kill your sick mother.

48:18.560 --> 48:20.280
And then I will kill you.

48:21.920 --> 48:23.320
And it won't be quick.

48:37.000 --> 48:38.480
[departing footsteps]

48:39.120 --> 48:40.160
[exhales sharply]

49:01.680 --> 49:03.480
I'll put a soldier in your mum's yard.

49:11.800 --> 49:15.720
No, we ain't gonna fix this problem
until we give Sugar that money, you know.

49:20.760 --> 49:22.920
To do that, we have to get Jamie
out of the way.

49:24.360 --> 49:27.160
That guy's got way too much
fucking soldiers around him.

49:31.320 --> 49:32.320
Hey, listen.

49:34.080 --> 49:36.160
It don't matter
how many soldiers he's got...

49:39.360 --> 49:41.040
but they could never have this.

49:44.400 --> 49:47.040
It's times like these, Dushane,
I wanna see yours.

49:52.520 --> 49:53.800
I'll find Jamie.

49:55.840 --> 49:59.560
The fuckin' second I lay my eyes on him,
this problem is fixed.

50:08.160 --> 50:09.240
I'm sorry about Donovan.

50:13.840 --> 50:14.760
[sighs]

50:22.800 --> 50:23.680
[tsks]

50:28.440 --> 50:30.360
Is it worth the squeeze?

50:31.560 --> 50:32.440
[chuckles]

50:34.320 --> 50:37.000
Fuckin' hell. [laughs]

50:38.760 --> 50:39.680
Mad.

50:40.720 --> 50:41.560
I'm sorry.

50:43.920 --> 50:44.760
What d'you mean?

50:45.680 --> 50:48.720
Just some shit Donovan
used to say about...

50:50.600 --> 50:52.360
'Is the juice worth the squeeze?'

50:55.360 --> 50:57.360
I don't fuckin' know anymore, Sully.

50:59.040 --> 51:00.080
All this shit...

51:01.360 --> 51:03.160
everything we're doin', is it worth it?

51:06.160 --> 51:07.840
I underestimated Sugar.

51:10.240 --> 51:11.840
Fuckin' Donovan's dead.

51:15.040 --> 51:16.360
Jason's gone.

51:17.200 --> 51:18.280
For what?

51:21.160 --> 51:22.680
Who's next? My mum?

51:26.160 --> 51:27.160
Taylor?

51:27.800 --> 51:28.920
Tasha?

51:33.200 --> 51:35.160
Ever since we were kids, bruv,

51:35.760 --> 51:38.400
together,
runnin' up and down these streets,

51:39.080 --> 51:40.600
tryin' to get to the top.

51:42.680 --> 51:43.520
What for?

51:47.400 --> 51:49.160
Is it worth losin' your people?

51:50.440 --> 51:51.640
Your family?

51:59.720 --> 52:00.880
What else is there?

52:05.560 --> 52:06.400
Hmm?

52:09.800 --> 52:11.360
What else are we gonna be?

52:36.200 --> 52:37.720
