00:09.840 --> 00:11.082
Man, this thing
is heavy.

00:11.082 --> 00:13.013
I know. My arms
are shaking.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.515
What are you guys
talking about?

00:14.515 --> 00:16.847
I'm only using one hand.
I'm not using any hands.

00:19.820 --> 00:21.422
What's in this thing, anyway?

00:21.422 --> 00:23.654
All the souvenirs my grandma
sent me over the years

00:23.654 --> 00:25.426
from her travels
and adventures.

00:25.426 --> 00:27.027
She's gonna be here
in two hours,

00:27.027 --> 00:28.599
so I want to put
all of this stuff out.

00:28.599 --> 00:30.000
This stuff is awesome.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.532
Why haven't you
gotten it out before?

00:31.532 --> 00:33.604
Whoa! This is a spear!

00:33.604 --> 00:35.436
Gotta throw it!
That's why.

00:37.368 --> 00:38.669
Look at all this.

00:38.669 --> 00:40.471
Your grandma's
led an incredible life.

00:40.471 --> 00:43.474
Yup, she and Grandpa
traveled the world together

00:43.474 --> 00:45.546
and even after
he passed away,

00:45.546 --> 00:47.078
it didn't slow her down.

00:47.078 --> 00:49.780
But the truth is,
I don't really know her.

00:49.780 --> 00:51.422
All right, I made
some room in the garage

00:51.422 --> 00:52.783
for Grandma
to park her chopper.

00:52.783 --> 00:55.456
Whoa, your grandma
rides a chopper?

00:55.456 --> 00:57.558
Yep, it's a V-twin
with a jockey shift,

00:57.558 --> 00:59.790
395 rear tire, ape
hanger handlebars

00:59.790 --> 01:01.192
and no, Cyd,
you cannot ride it.

01:02.693 --> 01:04.465
Grandma sounds pretty wild.

01:04.465 --> 01:06.397
Oh, yeah. She's
a real bold spirit.

01:06.397 --> 01:08.539
No one can tell her
what to do.

01:08.539 --> 01:11.242
She can also say
some pretty crazy things.

01:11.242 --> 01:12.603
Like how back
in the '50s,

01:12.603 --> 01:14.375
time-traveling
teenage girls

01:14.375 --> 01:16.277
came to her high school
graduation party.

01:16.277 --> 01:17.978
She says if it weren't
for those girls,

01:17.978 --> 01:20.511
she wouldn't have gotten
together with Grandpa Paul.

01:20.511 --> 01:22.153
What? That's unbelievable!

01:22.153 --> 01:24.385
Yes, Barry. That's why
I never believed it.

01:27.658 --> 01:29.019
Did you hear that?

01:29.019 --> 01:31.662
Two teenage time travelers
set up my grandparents.

01:31.662 --> 01:32.893
I mean, that's gotta be us.

01:32.893 --> 01:34.465
But that doesn't
make any sense.

01:34.465 --> 01:35.466
We haven't done that.

01:35.466 --> 01:38.028
It's a complicated
time travel paradox.

01:38.028 --> 01:39.470
See, in your
grandmother's past,

01:39.470 --> 01:40.571
it's already happened.

01:40.571 --> 01:42.533
But in your lifetime,
it hasn't happened yet.

01:42.533 --> 01:44.004
So you need to go do it.

01:44.004 --> 01:46.036
If you don't,
your grandparents
don't get together,

01:46.036 --> 01:47.538
your mother becomes
a different person,

01:47.538 --> 01:49.480
so you turn into
a different person.

01:49.480 --> 01:50.981
If you'd like
a more in-depth

01:50.981 --> 01:52.483
scientific explanation
of time loops,

01:52.483 --> 01:54.345
I'd be happy to provide...
Nope, we're good.

01:54.345 --> 01:55.816
Let's go to the '50s!

01:57.248 --> 02:00.221
It's gonna be so cool
to see my grandma
as a teenager.

02:00.221 --> 02:01.552
I can get to know her.

02:01.552 --> 02:04.295
And we can
go back and see what
the house looked like

02:04.295 --> 02:05.556
when she grew up here.

02:05.556 --> 02:07.428
Oh. And we can set her up
with Grandpa Paul.

02:07.428 --> 02:09.259
It'll be so romantic.

02:09.259 --> 02:10.800
You ready to go, Cyd?

02:10.800 --> 02:15.406
Yep, I'm ready to go to the
brutal swashbuckling days
of the roaring '50s.

02:15.406 --> 02:17.338
You have no idea
what the '50s are.

Hi, Rita.
Hi.

03:39.520 --> 03:40.691
Thank you
for coming to my party.

03:40.691 --> 03:42.253
I'm so glad you're here.

03:42.253 --> 03:43.694

gonna be able to make it.

gonna ride your chopper

daughter's wishes.

Here's an introduction
that's not weird.
I'm Shelby.

03:52.703 --> 03:55.336
Cool jackets.
So what are
the Pinkie Rings,

03:55.336 --> 03:58.038

we have a problem.

04:28.138 --> 04:30.541
My parents are
selling the RV.

04:30.541 --> 04:33.604
Apparently, they need money
to buy my sister Brittany
new glasses.

04:33.604 --> 04:35.776
Huh. I didn't notice
Brittany wore glasses

04:35.776 --> 04:37.648
that time I kissed her.
What?

04:37.648 --> 04:41.382
Uh, your parents are
selling the RV?

04:41.382 --> 04:44.815
I know! How are we going
to replicate time travel
without our lab?

04:44.815 --> 04:46.056
And they already
have a buyer.

04:46.056 --> 04:47.358
He's gonna be here
any minute.

Hey, guys, I'm here
about the RV.

04:56.266 --> 04:57.728
Name's Harry Vesper.

04:57.728 --> 04:59.670
Heck of a nice day.
How's it going?

04:59.670 --> 05:01.171
I don't like
this guy, Renaldo.

05:01.171 --> 05:02.773
He seems like a real jerk.

05:04.204 --> 05:05.676
You guys do science in here?

05:05.676 --> 05:07.708
I admire that.
A couple of young men

05:07.708 --> 05:08.939
trying to make
the world better.

05:08.939 --> 05:10.811
You see what I mean?
Jerk, jerk, jerk!

05:12.683 --> 05:15.386
This is one fine
recreational vehicle.

05:15.386 --> 05:17.648
Ugh. He even says
"vehicle" like a jerk.

05:19.119 --> 05:20.851
I am not going to
lose my lab.

05:20.851 --> 05:21.792
As much as it pains me,

05:21.792 --> 05:23.624
we're gonna need to
talk bad about the RV,

05:23.624 --> 05:25.325
so he won't want it.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.758
You don't want this
disgusting smelly RV.

05:27.758 --> 05:30.461
It belongs in the dump.
How dare you!
This RV is a classic.

05:30.461 --> 05:33.604
I'll take it.
Shuds, I just sold the RV.

05:33.604 --> 05:35.866
Ah, darn, I'll have to
come back later.

05:35.866 --> 05:37.007
I forgot I gave
all the cash

05:37.007 --> 05:39.810
I had on me
to the animal shelter.

05:39.810 --> 05:41.672
You just want to
save 'em all, don't you?

05:46.116 --> 05:47.718
I have never hated
anyone more.

05:52.252 --> 05:54.284
So Annette tells us
where to go.

05:54.284 --> 05:55.756
Sandy tells us
what to wear.

05:55.756 --> 05:57.558
And Gidget tells us
who to talk to.

05:57.558 --> 06:00.230
I haven't made a decision
in three years and I love it.

06:01.992 --> 06:05.696
Wow, you are not the girl
I expected to meet.
(CHUCKLES)

06:05.696 --> 06:07.938
Gee, Annette, that's some
pretty keen double-hooping.

06:07.938 --> 06:09.470
So keen, it's swell.

06:09.470 --> 06:11.742
Who's that?
That's Paul.

06:11.742 --> 06:13.203
Isn't he dreamy?

06:13.203 --> 06:14.875
Grandpa Paul?

06:14.875 --> 06:16.907
Well, he was
held back a year,

06:16.907 --> 06:18.178
but I wouldn't
call him grandpa.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.682
So you like him, huh?

06:21.682 --> 06:22.913
You should go talk to him.

06:22.913 --> 06:25.856
Oh, no. The boy has to
make the first move.

06:25.856 --> 06:27.688
He's gotta hold your books
on the way to class.

06:27.688 --> 06:30.491
Then ask your father's
permission to take
you out to the drive-in.

06:30.491 --> 06:32.322
After that, he'll
give you his class pin

06:32.322 --> 06:33.694
and ask you to go steady,

06:33.694 --> 06:35.526
then you get married,
then you have kids,

06:35.526 --> 06:36.997
then you talk to him.
(CHUCKLES)

06:38.429 --> 06:40.801
So maybe Paul will make
the first move with you.

06:40.801 --> 06:43.173
Something tells me
you two belong together.

06:43.173 --> 06:45.876
Nah, he likes Annette.
He doesn't even know
I'm alive. (CHUCKLES)

06:45.876 --> 06:47.608
(LADY WHISTLES)
Oh, gotta hoop!

06:49.740 --> 06:51.411
I love the '50s.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.183
There's no such thing
as healthy food.

06:53.183 --> 06:54.845
They have Jell-O
with hot dogs in it,

06:54.845 --> 06:56.146
and they call it a salad.

06:57.688 --> 06:59.920
Cyd, we have a problem.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.852
We're supposed to get
Paul together with Rita,

07:01.852 --> 07:03.023
but he's into Annette.

07:03.023 --> 07:04.625
And she's so keen,
she's swell,

07:04.625 --> 07:06.296
which is practically nifty!

07:06.296 --> 07:07.458
I'm assuming!

07:08.559 --> 07:10.400
How's Rita gonna
compete with that?

07:10.400 --> 07:12.603
Oh, no, Shelbs.
Remember what Barry said?

07:12.603 --> 07:13.864
If your grandparents
never get together,

07:13.864 --> 07:15.666
then your mom becomes
a different person,

07:15.666 --> 07:16.837
which makes you
a different person.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.338
I don't want to be
a different person.

07:18.338 --> 07:20.941
Don't worry. We'll turn Rita
into the niftiest swell

07:20.941 --> 07:22.012
this world's ever keen.

07:22.012 --> 07:23.544
I think I'm using
those words right.

07:23.544 --> 07:24.815
I'm pretty sure you're not,

07:24.815 --> 07:26.346
but I like the way
you're thinking.

07:32.883 --> 07:36.056
Dig deeper, Renaldo.
Search every corner
of the Internet.

07:36.056 --> 07:38.859
I'm not selling my RV
to that Harry Vesper guy.

07:38.859 --> 07:40.791
Something's wrong with him.
I don't trust him.

07:40.791 --> 07:42.793
Are you sure it's not
just because he's
buying your RV?

07:42.793 --> 07:44.364
Of course it's because
he's buying my RV.

07:44.364 --> 07:45.435
He's a fantastic guy.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.769
That's what
I'm saying, Barry.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.000
It even says here
he got out of prison

07:50.000 --> 07:51.141
for good behavior.

07:51.141 --> 07:52.843
He was in prison?

07:52.843 --> 07:54.204
Vesper's a criminal!

07:54.204 --> 07:55.646
A well-behaved criminal.

07:57.277 --> 07:59.650
This article says that
15 years ago,

07:59.650 --> 08:01.081
Vesper and another guy
were arrested

08:01.081 --> 08:02.452
for a jewel heist,

08:02.452 --> 08:05.215
but not before his partner
hid the jewels in an RV,

08:05.215 --> 08:06.987
which was never found.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.819
Renaldo, I think
this is the RV!

08:08.819 --> 08:10.490
If we can find the jewels,

08:10.490 --> 08:12.593
we could buy the RV
from your parents
and save the lab.

08:12.593 --> 08:14.164
But Vesper will be
back any minute.

08:14.164 --> 08:16.296
We need time to conduct
a thorough search.

08:16.296 --> 08:18.799
Where can we hide the RV
where nobody will be
on a weekend?

08:22.703 --> 08:24.234
It was really cool of your
sister's boyfriend

08:24.234 --> 08:26.176
to drive the RV
into the school for us.

08:26.176 --> 08:28.438
Especially, since he
found out I kissed her.

08:28.438 --> 08:30.410
What are you
talking about, Renaldo?

08:30.410 --> 08:32.613
The RV's in the school.
Let's talk about that.

08:34.414 --> 08:36.145
You know, I wasn't sure
we were gonna

08:36.145 --> 08:38.148
get this thing through
the loading dock.

08:38.148 --> 08:39.990
And the gym.
And the hallway.

08:39.990 --> 08:42.251
But we got it through
with just a few scratches.

08:49.660 --> 08:51.261
Well, let's go find
those jewels.

08:57.738 --> 09:00.210
Whoa, look what your grandma
did to your room.

09:00.210 --> 09:01.842
It's like we're inside
a bunny's mouth.

09:04.074 --> 09:06.476
It's so great that you're
gonna help get Paul
to notice me.

09:06.476 --> 09:07.778
Do you really think
it's gonna work?

09:07.778 --> 09:10.020
Of course. We just have to
get you to stand out

09:10.020 --> 09:11.351
from the other girls
at the party.

09:11.351 --> 09:14.224
Trust us. As two girls
who have gone on
one date each,

09:14.224 --> 09:15.686
we are experts.

09:17.227 --> 09:18.659
Show us where
your clothes are.

09:18.659 --> 09:20.030
Oh, uh, over here.

09:20.030 --> 09:21.992
I hope I have
something that'll work.

09:23.894 --> 09:25.636
SHELBY: What's all this?

09:25.636 --> 09:27.137
RITA: Oh, that's
just a thing I do.

09:27.137 --> 09:30.170
I collect pictures of places
I'd love to visit.

09:30.170 --> 09:31.401
It's not like I'm
really gonna go.

09:31.401 --> 09:33.443
I just like to think about it.

09:33.443 --> 09:35.646
And one day when you
get together with Paul,

09:35.646 --> 09:37.477
you'll go to all
of those places.

09:37.477 --> 09:39.710
And then you'll
get married and have kids

09:39.710 --> 09:41.151
and amazing grandkids.

09:41.151 --> 09:43.614
Well, one amazing grandkid
and Bret and Chet.

09:45.115 --> 09:47.017
You girls are so swell.

09:47.017 --> 09:48.188
I don't know if I'm
trusting you

09:48.188 --> 09:50.060
because I feel like
we have a connection,

09:50.060 --> 09:52.492
or if it's that I'm trying
to pretend like it's
perfectly normal

09:52.492 --> 09:54.094
that you dragged me
up to my bedroom

09:54.094 --> 09:55.365
even though you
don't even know me
and you're making me

09:55.365 --> 09:56.727
change clothes
at my own party.

09:56.727 --> 09:58.098
(CHUCKLES)

10:05.305 --> 10:07.938
We've looked everywhere
and no jewels!

10:07.938 --> 10:10.110
All we've found
are the unappreciated

10:10.110 --> 10:12.112
inventions of two
scientific pioneers

10:12.112 --> 10:14.314
who used to use
this RV as a lab.

10:14.314 --> 10:17.017
We'd have been better off
if we'd just used it
for camping.

10:17.017 --> 10:18.819
You can use this
for camping?

10:18.819 --> 10:20.120
How have we
never done that?

10:22.092 --> 10:24.094
Oh, remember this?

10:25.656 --> 10:27.557
The human flypaper I made

10:27.557 --> 10:30.861
when I feared an experiment
would transform me
into a human fly.

10:30.861 --> 10:32.002
I remember that!

10:32.002 --> 10:34.104
You said this invention
would get a lot of "buzz."

10:34.104 --> 10:36.737
Not now, Renaldo.
Now is a sad time.

10:39.109 --> 10:41.241
I guess I'll just have to
accept the reality

10:41.241 --> 10:43.613
that there's no way
we're gonna save this RV.

10:43.613 --> 10:45.946
I'm gonna miss every
little thing about her.

10:45.946 --> 10:47.948
The way the
turn signal sticks.

10:47.948 --> 10:50.020
The gentle hum of the engine.

10:50.020 --> 10:52.282
The way the speaker rattles

10:52.282 --> 10:55.055
like there's a bag
of jewels in it.

10:55.055 --> 10:57.227
Barry! That's a
perfect description

10:57.227 --> 10:58.859
of how it sounds
when the speaker rattles!

11:05.966 --> 11:07.067
(GASPS)
The jewels!

11:07.067 --> 11:09.599
Now we can buy the RV
from my parents.

11:10.741 --> 11:12.903
Hey guys, I know
you're in there.

11:12.903 --> 11:13.874
(BARRY SQUEALING)

11:15.075 --> 11:17.507
Shuds! How'd he find us?

11:17.507 --> 11:19.009
There's no way
of knowing, Barry.

11:19.009 --> 11:22.112
Renaldo left a note
for the pizza guy saying
where to deliver the pizza.

11:22.112 --> 11:24.955
Also, I ate your pizza!

11:27.557 --> 11:29.119
Oh, thank goodness.
I think he's leaving.

11:30.791 --> 11:31.992
(SQUEALS)

11:37.828 --> 11:39.129
You know, in the game
against County,

11:39.129 --> 11:40.570
I had 15 tackles.

11:40.570 --> 11:42.372
Which is a lot for a
basketball game.

11:44.534 --> 11:46.536
Okay. Paul is over there

11:46.536 --> 11:48.178
and Rita is ready.

11:48.178 --> 11:50.080
Oh, this is the moment
my grandparents

11:50.080 --> 11:52.012
are gonna fall
for each other.

11:52.012 --> 11:54.344
Rita! Come on,
this is your moment!

12:03.553 --> 12:07.457
Wow. You look just like
blonde Katy Perry.
(CHUCKLES)

12:07.457 --> 12:09.059
I look like Marilyn Monroe.

12:09.059 --> 12:11.161
That's the blonde Katy Perry
I'm talkin' about.

12:20.170 --> 12:23.113
Hi.
Hi.

12:23.113 --> 12:25.916
Do you want to dance?
Hi. (CHUCKLES)

12:28.218 --> 12:30.750
This is so beautiful.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.023
I'm getting to see
my grandparents
fall in love.

12:33.023 --> 12:35.055
And now we don't have
to worry about

12:35.055 --> 12:37.157
you turning into a
different person
like Barry said.

12:40.060 --> 12:42.762
Shelby! You have brown eyes!

12:42.762 --> 12:44.995
I have blue eyes.
Not anymore!

12:46.236 --> 12:48.068
Oh, hey, who's that?

12:48.068 --> 12:50.240
(SQUEALING)
I have brown eyes!

12:50.240 --> 12:52.973
Shelbs, I think you're
becoming a different person.

13:00.350 --> 13:02.212
Why are my eyes brown?

13:02.212 --> 13:04.254
We got my
grandparents together.

13:04.254 --> 13:06.086
Why am I turning into
a different person?

13:06.086 --> 13:07.557
We must have done
something wrong.

13:07.557 --> 13:10.590
But what? We have to talk
to my grandmother.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.262
And that was
the eighth tackle.

13:12.262 --> 13:14.264
He was waiting in line
ahead of me at the urinal,

13:14.264 --> 13:15.125
but I counted it.

13:15.125 --> 13:17.227
(LAUGHING)

13:17.227 --> 13:19.399
Excuse me, I don't
wanna interrupt but...

13:19.399 --> 13:21.101
Then beat it, you square.

13:21.101 --> 13:23.473
Man, your grandpa's
kind of a jerk.

13:23.473 --> 13:26.276
But my grandfather
wasn't a jerk.

13:26.276 --> 13:27.807
I don't get it.
This is Paul...

13:29.139 --> 13:30.140
Paul Bartow?

13:30.140 --> 13:32.512
My grandfather's last name
was McAllister!

13:32.512 --> 13:33.984
We got the wrong Paul!

13:34.845 --> 13:37.347
Shelby, your hair is brown.

13:39.089 --> 13:40.921
My hair is brown?

13:40.921 --> 13:42.192
Oh, no.
This is getting worse!

13:42.192 --> 13:43.854
I'm freaking out!

13:43.854 --> 13:45.555
We have to get your grandma
away from that jerk.

13:45.555 --> 13:47.097
And get her together
with my grandfather.

13:47.097 --> 13:49.129
We have to find
Paul McAllister.

13:49.129 --> 13:50.901
I'll go distract wrong Paul.

13:50.901 --> 13:53.303
You stay here with Rita
and find out where
the right Paul is.

13:53.303 --> 13:55.005
Don't worry, we'll figure
this all out

13:55.005 --> 13:56.836
before you turn into
a different person.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.108
Cyd, I'm scared.

13:58.108 --> 13:59.769
I don't know
if I can do this.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.712
I believe in you, Shelby.

14:04.214 --> 14:05.245
You can do it.

14:08.879 --> 14:10.780
So, you think
you can tackle me?

14:10.780 --> 14:13.183
Of course I can tackle you.
I'm varsity.

14:14.154 --> 14:15.285
Prove it.

14:18.358 --> 14:19.990
Rita, we need to talk.

14:19.990 --> 14:22.192
Shelby, you look
so different.

14:22.192 --> 14:24.194
Who are you trying to be?
Ava Gardner?

14:24.194 --> 14:25.996
I was thinking more
a brunette Taylor Swift,

14:25.996 --> 14:27.767
but sure, let's go
with the Taylor Swift
you're talking about.

14:29.239 --> 14:30.840
Look, I made a mistake.

14:30.840 --> 14:32.842
You're not supposed to be
with Paul Bartow.

14:32.842 --> 14:35.105
Are there any other
Pauls at this party?

14:35.105 --> 14:38.348
Uh, no.

14:38.348 --> 14:40.480
Then who am I supposed to
get you together with?

14:40.480 --> 14:42.552
I'm sorry, did I mess
this up somehow?

14:42.552 --> 14:45.315
Just tell me what
to do and I'll do it.

14:45.315 --> 14:47.187
I don't get it.

14:47.187 --> 14:49.759
My mother said
you were a bold spirit.

14:49.759 --> 14:52.262
That Rita wouldn't need me
to tell her what to do.

14:54.424 --> 14:56.126
But you're not that Rita.

14:57.267 --> 14:58.798
Maybe that's why
I'm here.

15:00.330 --> 15:03.303
Rita, I think I came here

15:03.303 --> 15:07.277
to help you become
the kind of adventurer
that you're supposed to be.

15:07.277 --> 15:09.339
Someone who doesn't
just collect postcards,

15:09.339 --> 15:11.311
someone who goes out
and sees the world.

15:11.311 --> 15:13.143
Those are just dreams.

15:13.143 --> 15:14.214
I know what my life
is gonna be.

15:14.214 --> 15:15.515
I'm gonna stay here
and get married

15:15.515 --> 15:17.287
like all my friends.

15:17.287 --> 15:18.388
But you don't have to.

15:20.550 --> 15:23.223
I thought I knew what
my life was gonna be.

15:23.223 --> 15:26.156
But then something happened,
something amazing.

15:27.027 --> 15:28.398
It took me to kindergarten,

15:28.398 --> 15:29.829
it took me to the '70s,

15:29.829 --> 15:31.331
it brought me here.

15:31.331 --> 15:32.432
What are you talking about?

15:32.432 --> 15:36.636
Rita, I've always had
everything planned out, too,

15:36.636 --> 15:38.308
but lately the best things

15:38.308 --> 15:39.469
that have been
happening to me

15:39.469 --> 15:41.771
haven't been a part
of any plan.

15:41.771 --> 15:43.813
And it's been the most
incredible adventure

15:43.813 --> 15:45.245
you could ever imagine.

15:46.646 --> 15:47.817
I wish I could have that.

15:50.320 --> 15:51.321
But aren't you ever afraid?

15:52.222 --> 15:53.223
Of course I am.

15:54.624 --> 15:56.556
Then how do you do it?

15:56.556 --> 15:58.828
I have someone who
believes in me.

15:58.828 --> 16:01.061
And sometimes that's all
it takes to be brave.

16:02.062 --> 16:03.493
I wish I had
someone like that.

16:05.465 --> 16:08.938
Rita, I believe in you.

16:10.670 --> 16:11.871
You can do it.

16:13.503 --> 16:16.346
(BOTH YELLING)

16:18.178 --> 16:20.710
Whoo! I told you
I could take you down.

16:21.881 --> 16:24.384
Rita, your party's
the pits. Let's go.

16:34.124 --> 16:36.426
Shelby?
What? Did something
else change?

16:38.828 --> 16:40.330
Everything else changed.

16:41.631 --> 16:43.473
Pick up the pace, Rita.
Let's go.

16:43.473 --> 16:46.136
Paul, just go without me.

16:46.806 --> 16:48.378
I'm not the girl for you.

16:48.378 --> 16:50.380
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?

16:50.380 --> 16:52.742
Not really.
But I know I can do it.

17:01.851 --> 17:03.753
Shelby, you're back.

17:03.753 --> 17:06.455
I'm back? I'm back!

17:08.657 --> 17:11.531
Well, I did it.
What comes next?

17:12.732 --> 17:14.534
Everything.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.536
Hey, you have blonde hair
and blue eyes again.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.508
Oh, yes, one last thing
to tell you.

17:18.508 --> 17:20.569
We're time travelers.

17:20.569 --> 17:22.472
We're gonna leave some
tachyons behind, they're
totally harmless,

17:22.472 --> 17:23.813
just let them fade
on their own.

17:35.485 --> 17:38.258
Open up! I know
my jewels are in there!

17:38.258 --> 17:39.959
We should just give
Vesper the jewels.

17:39.959 --> 17:41.561
This isn't worth it.
I know.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.363
And as a man of science
I should do what is rational.

17:43.363 --> 17:46.896
But I can't.
I can't lose this RV.

17:46.896 --> 17:49.569
Renaldo, this isn't
just a place where
we do experiments.

17:49.569 --> 17:52.642
It's the only place I feel
like I can be myself.

17:52.642 --> 17:55.775
If I lose it, where am I
going to fit in?

17:55.775 --> 17:57.947
Wherever we decide to
hang out together, Barry.

17:59.279 --> 18:01.811
(BANGING ON DOOR)
Come on! Open up!

18:01.811 --> 18:03.012
We'll be okay.

18:03.012 --> 18:04.654
Just as long as he
doesn't realize

18:04.654 --> 18:05.955
the entire other wall
is missing.

18:05.955 --> 18:07.457
You boys know
I can hear you, right?

18:07.457 --> 18:08.458
This entire wall
is missing.

18:09.619 --> 18:11.621
(BOTH SCREAM)
Enough playin' around!

18:14.063 --> 18:17.727
My partner hid those
from me 15 years ago
in this RV.

18:17.727 --> 18:19.299
But I got here first.

18:19.299 --> 18:20.900
No, please, we need
these jewels.

18:20.900 --> 18:24.174
I need 'em too.
Those jewels are gonna
finance my next heist.

18:24.174 --> 18:27.437
And whatever's left over,
I'll give to the
animal shelter.

18:27.437 --> 18:29.939
Wait, I'm confused. Are you
a good guy or a bad guy?

18:29.939 --> 18:32.111
I'm complicated.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.314
Now give me those jewels
before I have to get rough.

18:34.314 --> 18:35.985
I'm not giving you
the jewels.

18:37.847 --> 18:39.419
(GRUNTS AND CHUCKLES)

18:39.419 --> 18:43.323
Mr. Vesper, please. I need
those jewels to buy the RV.

18:43.323 --> 18:45.625
There must be some way
you and I can work
this out amicably.

18:45.625 --> 18:46.756
If only...

18:48.228 --> 18:50.059
You know what? Never mind.

18:50.059 --> 18:51.461
Enjoy your jewels.

18:54.033 --> 18:55.435
(GRUNTING)

18:55.435 --> 18:57.437
Oh, I can't believe
you captured me.

18:57.437 --> 18:58.638
I'm so mad!

18:59.639 --> 19:01.010
But also kinda relieved.

19:01.010 --> 19:02.572
You know how sometimes
you just want someone

19:02.572 --> 19:04.073
to stop you
from doing bad things?

19:05.915 --> 19:07.777
Man, this guy
is complicated.

19:09.819 --> 19:12.582
(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)

19:12.582 --> 19:14.654
Unfortunately, there was
no reward money

19:14.654 --> 19:16.256
for finding the jewels.

19:16.256 --> 19:19.659
So, there goes our last
chance at buying the RV
from my parents.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.291
But, on the bright side,
they'll still be able to

19:21.291 --> 19:23.132
get Brittany
those new glasses.

19:23.132 --> 19:24.594
And then if I kissed her,

19:24.594 --> 19:25.735
it'd be like kissing
a whole new girl.

19:25.735 --> 19:26.836
But still your sister.

19:28.498 --> 19:31.070
Renaldo, I've been pretending
all day I haven't heard this.

19:31.070 --> 19:33.443
I will give you
the gentleman's
five-second head start.

19:33.443 --> 19:34.704
That's really
kind of you, Barry.

19:44.754 --> 19:47.217
SHELBY'S MOM:
Girls, Grandma Rita's here!

19:49.889 --> 19:52.622
Do you think she knows
it's us who visited her?

19:52.622 --> 19:54.494
Of course not.
It's been a minute to us,

19:54.494 --> 19:56.666
but it's been like
200 years to her.

19:56.666 --> 19:58.728
Cyd, how long ago
do you think the '50s were?

19:58.728 --> 20:00.500
Two hundred years.
Did I not just say that?

20:02.832 --> 20:04.033
Grandma!
(CHUCKLES)

20:04.033 --> 20:06.636
I've just spent six months
on a cruise ship

20:06.636 --> 20:09.279
and 500 miles on a chopper.

20:09.279 --> 20:11.281
(LAUGHS) I need hugs.

20:13.943 --> 20:16.416
Hi, I'm Cyd.
(CROONING)

20:16.416 --> 20:20.219
Mom, is that a tattoo
of a toilet on your arm?

20:20.219 --> 20:22.692
Yeah, I won a bet.

20:22.692 --> 20:23.523
You won a bet?

20:23.523 --> 20:26.155
Yeah. The other guy
has it on his face.

20:26.496 --> 20:28.498
(LAUGHING)

20:28.498 --> 20:30.600
Girls, look what
Grandma brought me.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.502
This totally makes up
for you not being there

20:32.502 --> 20:33.503
when the twins
were born.

20:33.503 --> 20:35.134
(CHUCKLES)
I knew it would.

20:35.134 --> 20:36.205
(CHUCKLES)

20:37.507 --> 20:39.509
Sometimes it's not about
being heard,

20:39.509 --> 20:41.040
it's just about getting
to say it out loud.

20:43.713 --> 20:45.515
You girls just got back,
didn't you?

20:47.617 --> 20:49.048
So you know?

20:49.048 --> 20:52.382
I've been waiting
all this time
to thank you.

20:52.382 --> 20:55.655
If you girls
hadn't believed in me,

20:55.655 --> 20:58.328
I would never have
followed my dreams.

20:58.328 --> 21:00.660
I never would have
traveled the world,

21:00.660 --> 21:04.594
and I would never have met
Paul McAllister

21:04.594 --> 21:07.467
trekking through
the Himalayas.

21:07.467 --> 21:10.640
So in a way, we did get you
and Grandpa together.

21:10.640 --> 21:12.772
Your grandpa always
said that he fell for me

21:12.772 --> 21:17.176
because he could see that
I had a bold spirit.

21:17.176 --> 21:22.682
Everything I am,
I became the night
you girls visited me.

21:22.682 --> 21:26.686
I never knew how important
we were to each other
until now.

21:26.686 --> 21:30.660
I love you, Grandma.
And I love you, Shelby.

21:30.660 --> 21:34.023
Oh, Cyd, I've got
something for you.

21:35.665 --> 21:37.567
Oh, don't mess
with me, old lady.

21:37.567 --> 21:39.068
Is that a hot dog salad?

21:39.068 --> 21:40.700
You know it is, girl!

21:40.700 --> 21:42.472
(CHUCKLING)

21:44.474 --> 21:45.835
Ugh! (SPITS)

21:45.835 --> 21:47.437
That from the '50s?

21:47.437 --> 21:48.638
You know it is, girl.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.486
Stop packing, Renaldo.
I have good news!

21:56.486 --> 21:57.647
The police were so impressed

21:57.647 --> 21:59.048
with our human
flypaper design,

21:59.048 --> 22:00.520
that they are
commissioning us to make more

22:00.520 --> 22:02.592
for the entire Portland
Police Department.

22:02.592 --> 22:05.395
We'll have enough money
to buy the RV from my parents.

22:05.395 --> 22:06.656
We don't have to
lose our lab.

22:06.656 --> 22:08.097
That's great, Barry.

22:08.097 --> 22:09.228
But we better get going.

22:09.228 --> 22:10.630
We're gonna be late
for first period.

22:10.630 --> 22:12.131
