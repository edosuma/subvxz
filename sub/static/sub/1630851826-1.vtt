02:25.896 --> 02:27.356
Daddy, I heard something.

02:27.523 --> 02:29.816
-Oh, yeah? What'd you hear?
-A noise.

02:30.484 --> 02:33.820
It's just us working.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.322
Why can't I come in with you?

02:35.489 --> 02:37.741
'Cause I said so.
Ain't a place for kids.

02:38.116 --> 02:39.409
We're almost done now.

02:39.576 --> 02:42.329
Do not leave this truck.
Or drive off with it.

02:43.121 --> 02:44.456
You hear me?

02:48.043 --> 02:49.628
Go and put that in the glove box.

02:51.046 --> 02:52.506
I'll be right back, bud.

02:53.257 --> 02:54.424
Love you!

02:55.050 --> 02:57.594
I'll finish up
and we'll go get your brother, Lucas.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.846
All right, let's get outta here.

04:34.983 --> 04:37.945
Hey, Frank, we still got plenty
to do one more batch if you want.

04:48.372 --> 04:49.957
The fuck was that?

04:50.958 --> 04:52.125
Listen.

04:58.298 --> 05:01.468
You said they weren't gonna reopen this place
for another few weeks.

05:03.512 --> 05:05.180
The fuck is that, Frank?

05:08.809 --> 05:10.644
That's gotta be an animal.

05:16.733 --> 05:17.943
Fuck me.

05:20.237 --> 05:22.030
-The fuck you going, Frank?
-Come on.

05:22.781 --> 05:23.782
Fuck.

05:35.169 --> 05:36.670
The fuck is going on?

05:40.215 --> 05:41.341
Where you going?

05:43.468 --> 05:44.469
Frank.

05:47.472 --> 05:48.473
Fuck.

05:56.273 --> 05:58.442
Frank, let's get the fuck
outta here, all right?

05:58.609 --> 05:59.651
Let's get the fuck outta here.

05:59.818 --> 06:01.778
Something's on fucking fire, man.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.073
Frank!

06:05.199 --> 06:08.285
Let's get the fuck outta here, buddy.
Let's get the fuck outta here.

06:09.203 --> 06:10.412
This is fucked up, man.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.122
Where you going?

06:13.040 --> 06:14.416
Let's get the fuck outta here.

06:15.542 --> 06:16.543
Frank!

06:17.127 --> 06:18.754
Run, Frank, run!

06:21.298 --> 06:22.299
Oh, my God!

06:23.425 --> 06:24.426
Frank!

06:28.263 --> 06:29.389
Kenny!

06:56.083 --> 06:57.501
Daddy?

06:59.878 --> 07:01.296
Daddy?

07:37.332 --> 07:38.667
I'll be right out.

07:56.685 --> 07:59.313
It's obviously much more than just that.

07:59.688 --> 08:02.482
Would anyone like to help him elaborate?

08:04.776 --> 08:09.531
So, storytelling is a way for people
to explain their world...

08:09.698 --> 08:11.783
their culture...

08:11.950 --> 08:14.995
passing on customs and beliefs
from one generation to the next.

08:15.537 --> 08:18.832
In America, and especially here in Oregon...

08:18.999 --> 08:22.169
storytelling started with
our indigenous people.

08:22.336 --> 08:25.839
Native Americans who were teaching
the younger people...

08:26.006 --> 08:29.176
in their communities
about their culture and identities.

08:29.593 --> 08:34.431
Can anyone give me an example
of a fable or a myth?

08:34.640 --> 08:36.975
Or a fairy tale even.

08:38.227 --> 08:40.354
Brody, give it a shot.

08:43.607 --> 08:46.610
Evie, do you have any stories
you wanna share?

08:48.862 --> 08:49.863
Lucas.

08:50.322 --> 08:51.573
Give me an example of...

08:53.283 --> 08:55.369
a fable or a myth.

08:55.536 --> 08:56.537
Come on.

08:59.164 --> 09:00.249
Anyone? Anyone?

09:01.458 --> 09:03.168
Okay. Go ahead, Jasmine.

09:03.335 --> 09:05.838
"Goldilocks."
"Goldilocks" is a fairy tale.

09:06.004 --> 09:07.005
That's very good.

09:07.172 --> 09:08.632
What's the story of "Goldilocks"?

09:08.715 --> 09:09.716
Lucas.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.635
While a family of bears are away...

09:11.802 --> 09:15.264
Goldilocks enters their house
and eats their porridge.

09:15.472 --> 09:17.724
Then the bears come home
and get angry with her.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.143
That's right. Very good.

09:20.310 --> 09:22.771
So, is there a moral or a lesson
in that story?

09:22.938 --> 09:23.939
Yes.

09:24.022 --> 09:25.732
Don't eat bears' food without permission.

09:25.899 --> 09:29.361
That's right.
Don't take something that's not yours.

09:29.820 --> 09:32.614
Hey, everyone, be prepared to discuss
and write about...

09:32.781 --> 09:36.076
a fairy tale or a myth when you come back.

10:03.979 --> 10:05.522
Guys, let's go.

11:58.468 --> 12:00.470
Here you go, ma'am. Nice to see ya.

12:08.312 --> 12:10.105
That'll be $3.

12:13.734 --> 12:15.110
Is that everything?

12:22.451 --> 12:24.328
That'll be $4.50, please.

12:26.288 --> 12:30.000
<i>...have already begun rolling back
environmental regulations.</i>

12:30.167 --> 12:33.587
<i>Today, an EPA spokesman
announced a comprehensive plan...</i>

12:33.754 --> 12:38.800
<i>to revive the coal industry by promoting
what is known as mountaintop mining.</i>

12:38.967 --> 12:41.136
<i>In remote Cispus Falls, Oregon...</i>

12:41.303 --> 12:45.849
<i>the Greymouth Mine is one of a handful

12:46.016 --> 12:49.144
<i>ending what they say
is a war on American energy.</i>

13:53.667 --> 13:54.877
Hey, sis.

13:56.712 --> 13:57.880
How was school?

14:01.175 --> 14:02.759
It's about the same.

14:04.636 --> 14:07.556
Just give it time.
They'll warm to you.

14:08.473 --> 14:11.560
I'm not sure it's about warming.

14:14.479 --> 14:17.774
It's just not... what I hoped it would be.

14:25.240 --> 14:27.492
You want me to move that out of here?

14:32.956 --> 14:35.834
All right, I'm gonna try
and get some sleep. Good night.

14:36.001 --> 14:37.085
Good night.

16:20.522 --> 16:21.607
Boy.

16:30.574 --> 16:33.452
<i>Opioid epidemic persists in rural Oregon.</i>

16:44.922 --> 16:46.882
The basket by the phone.

16:53.847 --> 16:55.933
Can you not move my stuff, please?

16:56.099 --> 16:59.436
I have it all where it is,
so I know where it is.

17:00.896 --> 17:02.648
Sorry. Yeah.

17:07.903 --> 17:09.863
I was just trying to give us more space.

17:10.989 --> 17:12.699
I'm gonna move out as soon as I can.

17:13.242 --> 17:15.786
Jules, I didn't say anything
about moving out.

17:21.750 --> 17:24.545
I'm sorry.
I'm just getting ready to go evict...

17:25.378 --> 17:27.548
another family with kids.

17:28.173 --> 17:30.843
Give 'em 10, 15 minutes...

17:31.260 --> 17:32.928
to grab what they can carry,
throw it in their car...

17:33.095 --> 17:35.597
if they have a car, and then...

17:37.307 --> 17:40.018
I wish you wouldn't have run, Paul.
You didn't have to.

17:40.185 --> 17:41.979
There weren't exactly too many people...

17:42.396 --> 17:47.025
banging down the doors for the position
after Warren Stokes retired.

17:51.905 --> 17:53.991
I barely recognize this place anymore.

17:55.993 --> 17:59.913
Yeah, well, a lot can change in 20 years.

18:02.958 --> 18:06.461
It's our own little slice of paradise here.

18:17.306 --> 18:18.682
<i>Who's next?</i>

18:21.310 --> 18:22.311
Lucas.

18:23.270 --> 18:24.771
You wanna read us your story?

18:24.938 --> 18:26.398
He can't read, Ms. Meadows.

18:26.565 --> 18:27.858
-Clint.
-Yes, he can.

18:29.610 --> 18:31.528
I know you've been working on a story.

18:32.237 --> 18:33.989
Will you read us a little bit?

18:47.377 --> 18:50.797
Once, there were three bears...

18:50.964 --> 18:54.384
that lived in a dark and wet cave...

18:54.551 --> 18:56.887
up above a small town.

18:57.054 --> 19:00.891
Big Bear, Little Bear, and Baby Bear.

19:02.809 --> 19:06.855
Big Bear used to take care
of the little bears.

19:07.689 --> 19:09.691
But Big Bear got sick.

19:12.027 --> 19:13.570
Lost his job.

19:14.446 --> 19:16.406
And his insides turned black.

19:20.577 --> 19:23.997
One day, Little Bear came home...

19:24.164 --> 19:27.417
and Big Bear and Baby Bear were different.

19:28.836 --> 19:31.755
Big Bear's sickness had gotten worse.

19:31.922 --> 19:36.885
Big Bear has become
more angrier and meaner...

19:39.012 --> 19:41.348
because they had no food.

19:41.890 --> 19:43.100
No meat.

19:48.230 --> 19:49.857
It's very good, Lucas.

19:52.359 --> 19:54.486
But they had each other.

20:11.503 --> 20:13.463
You know he belongs there, right?

20:16.592 --> 20:19.094
Oh, my God! Is that dog shit?

20:19.261 --> 20:21.972
God, dude. That smells like ass. God.

20:23.473 --> 20:25.767
What kind of a person
would put that in there?

20:28.103 --> 20:31.565
You motherfucker!
You think this is funny? Eat it!

20:33.275 --> 20:35.360
Fight! Fight! Fight!

20:35.527 --> 20:37.613
-Clint! Hey! Clint, stop!
-Eat it!

20:37.779 --> 20:39.072
Does that hurt?

20:42.701 --> 20:43.702
Okay.

20:45.954 --> 20:47.539
Okay, you put your shirt back on.

20:53.045 --> 20:54.546
I'll be right out.

23:04.301 --> 23:07.846
Hey. I was just about to go in there.
You wanna join me?

23:10.933 --> 23:12.392
That's not why I invited you in.

23:12.559 --> 23:15.562
I invited you in to have ice cream...

23:15.729 --> 23:19.733
because I wanted to know
if ice cream is your favorite vegetable.

23:20.484 --> 23:22.236
Because it's mine.

23:23.278 --> 23:24.821
Ice cream isn't a vegetable.

23:24.988 --> 23:26.073
Yeah, it is.

23:26.240 --> 23:27.699
It's a dessert.

23:27.866 --> 23:30.285
To most people, yeah.
But to me?

23:31.203 --> 23:32.538
Totally a vegetable.

23:35.541 --> 23:40.128
So, if ice cream is a vegetable,
what's your favorite fruit?

23:42.464 --> 23:43.757
Come on.

23:45.050 --> 23:46.218
Donuts?

23:46.385 --> 23:49.429
Mine too. Chocolate, obviously.

23:50.097 --> 23:52.349
I also like cheeseburgers as a fruit.

23:57.229 --> 24:00.232
What about your brother?
Does he like ice cream?

24:01.400 --> 24:03.402
How do you know I have a brother?

24:04.444 --> 24:06.572
Teachers know everything.

24:09.032 --> 24:10.492
So where is he?

24:11.451 --> 24:13.078
At home.

24:13.245 --> 24:14.413
With your mom?

24:15.414 --> 24:19.751
If you knew everything,
then you would know my mom's dead.

24:21.420 --> 24:23.046
I'm sorry to hear that.

24:24.506 --> 24:28.260
But that's something we have in common.
My mom died too.

24:30.387 --> 24:31.680
Really?

24:32.431 --> 24:34.224
When I was 12.

24:35.058 --> 24:36.351
I'm 12.

24:36.894 --> 24:37.936
I know.

24:39.980 --> 24:41.565
So tell me about your brother.
What's his name?

24:45.444 --> 24:46.445
Aiden.

24:48.655 --> 24:50.073
How old's Aiden?

24:52.117 --> 24:53.118
Seven.

24:53.577 --> 24:56.496
Oh, so he's... Is he in our school?

24:57.539 --> 24:58.999
Not anymore.

25:04.046 --> 25:05.839
He's always with my dad.

25:08.050 --> 25:10.135
Does your dad teach him at home?

25:10.844 --> 25:12.554
What's your dad do?

25:15.641 --> 25:16.975
I gotta go.

25:21.313 --> 25:23.148
And don't follow me this time.

26:06.859 --> 26:08.068
Move!

26:08.235 --> 26:09.236
Shoo.

28:20.742 --> 28:21.827
Hello?

29:06.580 --> 29:08.957
-What... What?
-Jesus! Jesus!

29:10.125 --> 29:11.418
I thought you heard me.

29:11.960 --> 29:12.961
No.

29:14.213 --> 29:15.547
The fuck is this?

29:17.674 --> 29:20.052
Is that the kind of thing
you taught in California?

29:23.722 --> 29:25.849
'Cause I don't think that's gonna fly here.

29:32.523 --> 29:33.524
Paul.

29:38.278 --> 29:42.324
You have every right to resent me.

29:47.996 --> 29:50.332
I don't blame you for that.

29:51.458 --> 29:54.294
I know you couldn't have understood then...

29:54.461 --> 29:56.839
but I couldn't stay in this house anymore.

29:58.674 --> 30:02.344
Just know that I have spent my life...

30:03.929 --> 30:06.181
trying to deal with leaving you.

30:07.975 --> 30:12.563
And resolve my issues.

30:13.564 --> 30:15.440
And it has not been easy.

30:16.900 --> 30:21.738
Yeah, and I've spent my entire life
praying you'd come back.

31:47.866 --> 31:48.867
Go!

32:10.848 --> 32:11.849
Here.

32:12.891 --> 32:14.351
I got this for you.

32:25.529 --> 32:28.115
I'll come back after he's eaten.
He'll be tired.

33:50.989 --> 33:52.241
<i>Daddy, no.</i>

33:55.661 --> 33:57.913
<i>No. Daddy.</i>

33:59.456 --> 34:01.166
<i>Please. You're hurting me.</i>

34:02.543 --> 34:04.962
Hey, Jules. What? What?

34:06.547 --> 34:08.257
-Jesus!
-Sorry.

34:08.924 --> 34:10.342
You okay?

34:11.802 --> 34:13.846
-Jesus.
-Sorry.

34:15.097 --> 34:16.223
I was just...

34:17.224 --> 34:20.768
I wanted to clear the air and talk.

34:23.230 --> 34:24.731
-You sure you're okay?
-Yeah.

34:29.319 --> 34:30.946
Well, no. I'm...

34:32.906 --> 34:34.324
So many...

34:40.746 --> 34:44.585
Hey... do you know Frank Weaver?

34:44.751 --> 34:46.085
Of course.

34:46.712 --> 34:47.713
I've cited him...

34:47.880 --> 34:52.759
and revived him with Narcan
more times than I can count.

34:53.177 --> 34:54.219
Why?

34:54.386 --> 34:57.222
His son is a student of mine.

34:58.974 --> 35:00.017
That was his drawing.

35:00.642 --> 35:02.394
I pulled it from the trash.

35:02.561 --> 35:03.979
That makes sense, yeah.

35:04.146 --> 35:05.480
Every time I see him...

35:05.647 --> 35:09.109
I expect to find Frank dead
with a needle in his arm.

35:09.276 --> 35:11.361
So why isn't he in jail?

35:12.362 --> 35:14.114
I don't know. I've tried many times...

35:14.281 --> 35:18.994
but he goes away,
who takes care of the boys?

35:19.578 --> 35:20.954
After their mother died...

35:21.121 --> 35:26.627
Protective Services felt he was somehow
fit enough to be their guardian.

35:26.793 --> 35:30.631
And what can I say to that?

35:30.797 --> 35:32.758
Something is going on there.

35:32.925 --> 35:35.594
First of all,
it looks like no one even lives there.

35:35.761 --> 35:37.971
And when I got close...

35:39.056 --> 35:40.057
You went to his house?

35:40.682 --> 35:44.561
I thought I heard something
that did not sound normal.

35:44.728 --> 35:46.063
You can't do that.

35:46.230 --> 35:47.898
You can't go to Frank Weaver's house...

35:48.065 --> 35:49.608
-without telling me.
-I heard something, and it was not normal.

35:52.569 --> 35:53.403
Do you understand? You can't do that.

35:53.570 --> 35:55.072
Everyone thinks these problems
are just gonna go away...

35:55.239 --> 35:56.990
and we know that they don't.

36:07.376 --> 36:08.502
Lucas?

36:11.338 --> 36:15.008
Lucas... I'm hungry.

38:16.755 --> 38:19.007
-Where did you get this?
-His desk.

38:24.263 --> 38:26.348
It's textbook, Ellen.

38:26.723 --> 38:28.141
Emotional, physical...

38:28.308 --> 38:29.560
Hold on.

38:30.102 --> 38:33.897
Neither of us are experts
in diagnosing abuse, but I hear you.

38:34.690 --> 38:37.401
This is very disturbing.

38:39.820 --> 38:43.198
But sadly, Lucas is not the only one
not getting the attention he needs.

38:43.365 --> 38:45.409
But he's here. In a safe space.

38:45.576 --> 38:47.119
What is that supposed to mean?

38:47.286 --> 38:49.580
His younger brother, why isn't he enrolled?

38:49.913 --> 38:52.583
We've had plenty of students
that are homeschooled.

38:52.749 --> 38:55.419
And they're kept out
so they can move product for their parents.

38:55.586 --> 38:59.965
Or so we don't smell methamphetamine
on their clothes, and turn their parents in.

39:01.466 --> 39:05.262
Okay, but regardless, that is a cry for help.

39:06.638 --> 39:09.391
Take it from someone who can diagnose abuse.

39:20.569 --> 39:24.281
I tell you what, next chance I get,
I will reach out to his father.

39:27.326 --> 39:28.202
<i>Here you go.</i>

39:33.540 --> 39:35.042
What can I do for ya?

39:40.380 --> 39:41.381
Sorry.

39:43.133 --> 39:43.926
Hey.

39:49.723 --> 39:51.600
I don't know, Paul.
It was just...

39:51.767 --> 39:54.102
The bottom half was all chewed to hell.

39:54.269 --> 39:55.979
Damnedest thing I ever saw.

39:57.689 --> 39:59.274
All right, well...

39:59.983 --> 40:02.611
We'll go take a look.
Thank you, Warren.

40:03.320 --> 40:04.404
Thanks, Sheriff.

40:11.203 --> 40:13.121
What's going on?

40:13.288 --> 40:18.043
He found a part of a man
in the woods today.

40:19.378 --> 40:20.963
Part of a man?

40:22.339 --> 40:24.007
Who is that?

40:24.591 --> 40:26.760
You don't remember Sheriff Stokes?

40:26.927 --> 40:29.054
-When we were kids?
-Yeah, I do.

40:30.472 --> 40:34.059
Yeah, he said he was
hiking up near Greymouth...

40:34.226 --> 40:37.271
when a stench led him...

40:37.437 --> 40:39.773
to a man half buried in the woods.

40:41.191 --> 40:45.904
I guess the other half was found in the mine,
near a meth lab.

40:47.447 --> 40:51.034
It was probably
a bear or a cougar, something.

40:51.201 --> 40:52.494
Jesus.

40:52.661 --> 40:54.371
Well, from what he just told me...

40:54.538 --> 40:59.459
I don't think Jesus was anywhere to be found.

41:00.586 --> 41:02.921
All right.
We gotta get out there and meet the coroner.

41:05.048 --> 41:06.175
See you later.

41:08.635 --> 41:09.636
Ready?

41:37.497 --> 41:39.499
-Hi.
-Hi.

41:40.042 --> 41:41.376
Are you okay?

41:44.880 --> 41:47.257
Is God really dead?

41:47.424 --> 41:48.509
What?

41:49.176 --> 41:51.553
Daddy said God is dead.

42:01.355 --> 42:03.732
Just remember what Mama told us.

42:04.399 --> 42:09.154
Me and you...
we was born under the lucky star.

42:14.993 --> 42:18.121
Here. I brought you these.

43:01.248 --> 43:04.543
Determining cause was virtually impossible.

43:05.377 --> 43:09.464
This has got to be an animal, right?

43:10.174 --> 43:12.634
No animal that I've ever seen.

43:13.343 --> 43:17.181
What's more troubling are the teeth marks...

43:17.347 --> 43:19.600
on the radial bone.

43:20.350 --> 43:22.102
They seem human.

43:25.772 --> 43:29.109
I don't quite know what to tell you, Paul.

43:30.777 --> 43:32.070
I'm sorry.

45:38.155 --> 45:40.908
<i>She false with Cassio!
Did you say with Cassio?</i>

45:41.074 --> 45:42.910
<i>With Cassio, mistress.
Go to, charm your tongue.</i>

45:43.076 --> 45:46.038
<i>I will not charm my tongue,
I am bound to speak.</i>

45:46.538 --> 45:49.583
<i>My mistress here lies murdered in her bed.</i>

45:49.750 --> 45:51.084
<i>Heavens forfend!</i>

45:53.086 --> 45:58.091
<i>Nay, stare not, masters, it is true, indeed.</i>

46:00.427 --> 46:02.513
<i>Nay, lay thee down and roar.</i>

46:02.679 --> 46:06.308
<i>For thou hast killed the sweetest innocent
that e'er did lift up eye.</i>

46:06.475 --> 46:07.476
<i>Oh, she was foul!</i>

46:07.643 --> 46:10.395
<i>Iago knows that she with Cassio
hath the act of shame...</i>

46:10.562 --> 46:11.605
<i>a thousand times committed.</i>

46:11.772 --> 46:12.648
<i>Oh, heavens!</i>

46:12.814 --> 46:14.066
<i>Cassio confessed it.</i>

46:14.233 --> 46:16.902
<i>And she did gratify his amorous works
with that same handkerchief.</i>

46:17.069 --> 46:18.445
<i>-Handkerchief.
-Alas!</i>

46:18.612 --> 46:20.155
<i>'Twill out, 'twill out.</i>

46:20.322 --> 46:21.698
<i>-Hold your peace.
-I peace?</i>

46:21.865 --> 46:24.868
<i>-No, I will speak as liberal as the north.
-Be wise.</i>

46:25.035 --> 46:29.081
<i>Let heaven and men and devils...</i>

46:29.248 --> 46:31.083
<i>let them all, all, all...</i>

46:39.424 --> 46:40.425
Hello?

46:49.351 --> 46:52.271
Mr. Weaver, it's Ellen Booth, from school.

47:07.995 --> 47:12.958
<i>Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil.</i>

47:13.709 --> 47:16.461
<i>Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?</i>

47:18.088 --> 47:19.173
<i>Demand me nothing.</i>

47:19.339 --> 47:21.717
<i>What you know, you know.</i>

47:24.678 --> 47:26.597
<i>Are there no stones in heaven...</i>

47:26.763 --> 47:29.099
<i>but what serve for the thunder?</i>

48:13.769 --> 48:15.354
Mr. Weaver!

49:08.073 --> 49:09.283
Hello?

49:30.220 --> 49:31.513
Oh, my God.

49:32.848 --> 49:34.725
You must be starving.

49:35.601 --> 49:37.394
What has he done to you?

51:21.623 --> 51:24.626
<i>Here's where we found
the other half of Kenny Glass, right here.</i>

51:27.171 --> 51:28.338
What are these?

51:28.505 --> 51:32.050
Medicine bags. Wards, for defense.

51:33.427 --> 51:35.721
But why would these be hanging in here?

51:49.568 --> 51:50.903
What about this?

51:54.281 --> 51:56.158
Is that from a buck?

51:56.325 --> 51:57.576
Nope.

51:57.743 --> 52:00.537
Nothing like anything I've seen before.

52:02.497 --> 52:03.999
How far back does this go?

52:04.166 --> 52:06.919
Far. But I wouldn't go any further.

52:09.838 --> 52:11.048
Go for Paul.

52:15.427 --> 52:16.595
Say again.

52:21.016 --> 52:22.392
10-9.

52:25.270 --> 52:26.605
<i>...missing person.</i>

52:26.772 --> 52:27.773
Shit.

52:29.733 --> 52:31.276
All right. Let's go.

53:09.565 --> 53:11.900
Headed to your house
full of drugged-out freaks?

53:13.402 --> 53:16.446
Teacher can't step in
to save your ass out here, faggot.

53:16.613 --> 53:17.865
I said I was sorry.

53:18.031 --> 53:19.658
I don't take apologies from pussies.

53:21.326 --> 53:24.538
Hey! Don't walk away from me
when I'm talking to you.

53:36.758 --> 53:37.593
Lucas!

54:53.377 --> 54:56.046
<i>When was the last time
you heard from Ellen?</i>

54:56.213 --> 54:57.548
Ellen Booth?

54:59.216 --> 55:01.969
Yesterday. Why?

55:03.303 --> 55:05.931
<i>Her husband called in
a missing person's report.</i>

55:06.098 --> 55:08.725
<i>Said she hadn't returned his calls...</i>

55:09.268 --> 55:10.811
<i>or been home all day.</i>

55:10.978 --> 55:11.812
<i>Really?</i>

55:14.022 --> 55:15.941
What are you doing about it?

55:16.108 --> 55:17.526
<i>Filed a report.</i>

55:17.693 --> 55:20.070
<i>Issued an APB, searched the hospitals...</i>

55:20.237 --> 55:25.409
<i>but aside from that,
just hope it's all a misunderstanding.</i>

55:28.495 --> 55:32.374
I asked her to talk to Frank Weaver.
About Lucas.

55:40.757 --> 55:42.176
You smell that?

55:42.342 --> 55:43.302
Yeah.

55:52.019 --> 55:53.770
Frank, it's Sheriff Meadows.

55:57.733 --> 55:59.985
Fucking place smells like death.

56:02.654 --> 56:04.448
Yeah, there's something wrong here.

56:09.620 --> 56:10.704
Frank!

56:16.210 --> 56:18.545
Let's get outta here.
We'll get a warrant tomorrow.

56:43.612 --> 56:45.781
<i>...small town of Cispus Falls, Oregon.</i>

56:45.948 --> 56:48.158
<i>Rumors of another round
of gruesome attacks...</i>

56:48.325 --> 56:52.246
<i>...processing evidence
and provide forensic expertise.</i>

56:52.412 --> 56:55.332
<i>Our attempts to contact
local law enforcement have gone unanswered...</i>

56:55.499 --> 56:57.876
Have you spoken with Clint's parents
this morning?

56:58.669 --> 57:02.464
Yes. They wanted to know
if he had been in school yesterday.

57:02.631 --> 57:05.008
And he was here
till the end of the day, right?

57:10.389 --> 57:12.558
Look, I know this has...

57:13.725 --> 57:16.478
been difficult on all of us.

57:17.563 --> 57:20.315
But right now, we have to work
under the assumption...

57:20.482 --> 57:24.194
that this is just some kind of a coincidence.

57:24.361 --> 57:25.571
We'll find him.

57:26.572 --> 57:27.823
We'll find him.

57:33.245 --> 57:34.413
Excuse me.

57:37.875 --> 57:39.710
-What?
-A coincidence?

57:40.460 --> 57:43.172
That my student is now missing, too?
What the fuck, Paul?

57:43.338 --> 57:45.757
What else would you like me to do, Jules?

57:46.633 --> 57:50.262
The warrant is being processed right now.
It takes time.

57:50.429 --> 57:51.471
-It doesn't just happen overnight.
-This is all related.

57:51.638 --> 57:54.099
-What would you like me to fucking do?
-You cannot tell me that it isn't.

58:49.279 --> 58:50.822
God almighty.

59:02.167 --> 59:04.378
These Frank Weaver's footprints?

59:05.003 --> 59:05.879
Some.

59:07.130 --> 59:08.841
There's also a child's.

59:21.228 --> 59:23.146
What the fuck is this?

59:26.608 --> 59:27.776
Jesus Christ.

59:30.362 --> 59:31.613
It's charred.

59:33.115 --> 59:34.449
It's burnt.

59:34.908 --> 59:36.618
And flayed.

59:38.704 --> 59:40.205
It's gotta be Frank Weaver.

59:41.123 --> 59:44.209
Yeah, the teeth will tell us.

59:44.668 --> 59:47.045
Looks like something just burst out of him.

59:56.180 --> 59:58.891
Lucas. Lucas, listen to me.
Listen, I don't want you to go in there.

59:59.057 --> 1:00:01.935
-No. No. Let me go!
-Listen, I know. It's okay.

1:00:02.102 --> 1:00:03.312
What's going on here?

1:00:25.584 --> 1:00:28.003
Well, needless to say, I'm concerned.

1:00:28.170 --> 1:00:30.923
He's severely dehydrated,
suffers from chronic malnourishment.

1:00:31.089 --> 1:00:34.301
I recommend keeping him overnight,
possibly longer...

1:00:34.468 --> 1:00:38.222
but I don't have to tell you
that he is a deeply damaged boy.

1:00:38.388 --> 1:00:41.475
Could be the circumstances
or his genetic disposition...

1:00:41.642 --> 1:00:45.771
but there are definite signs
of a psychiatric crisis here.

1:00:45.938 --> 1:00:49.149
Anti-anxiety, anti-psychotics
will be our friend...

1:00:49.316 --> 1:00:51.777
but given what he's just experienced...

1:00:52.361 --> 1:00:54.738
When do you think
I'll be able to interview him?

1:00:54.905 --> 1:00:57.241
Well, not tonight, certainly.

1:00:58.742 --> 1:01:00.869
What do you plan on doing with him?

1:01:01.036 --> 1:01:02.996
Well, we're discussing that.

1:01:05.666 --> 1:01:07.167
But it's complicated.

1:01:07.334 --> 1:01:08.961
Oh, I'm sure.

1:01:09.419 --> 1:01:12.089
The little fella's
got a long road ahead of him.

1:01:13.423 --> 1:01:14.925
I'd be remiss if I didn't mention...

1:01:15.092 --> 1:01:19.388
but it's clear that he has been
subjected to abuse.

1:01:20.222 --> 1:01:21.932
And for some time.

1:01:23.684 --> 1:01:24.977
Thank you, Alan.

1:01:34.570 --> 1:01:36.196
We can't. No.

1:01:36.363 --> 1:01:37.948
He has no one.

1:01:39.908 --> 1:01:41.493
We don't know where the brother is.

1:01:43.370 --> 1:01:44.663
So where's he gonna go?

1:01:44.830 --> 1:01:48.250
I have no idea right now,
but he is not your responsibility.

1:01:48.417 --> 1:01:50.460
He doesn't have a family.

1:01:50.627 --> 1:01:54.089
And he's my student.
So he is my responsibility.

1:01:54.798 --> 1:01:55.883
Jules...

1:01:57.134 --> 1:01:59.428
This is not about you.

1:01:59.595 --> 1:02:01.763
This is about him,
and getting him the help...

1:02:01.930 --> 1:02:03.640
What did you just say to me?

1:02:04.224 --> 1:02:06.185
What did you just say to me?

1:02:08.937 --> 1:02:12.274
Don't put our past on him.

1:02:12.733 --> 1:02:14.318
Oh, I'm sorry.

1:02:14.484 --> 1:02:16.695
Did he snap your arm in two?

1:02:17.905 --> 1:02:20.407
Did he force you
to hide under the floor of that kitchen...

1:02:20.574 --> 1:02:22.451
-praying he would never come home?
-You have no idea what he...

1:02:22.618 --> 1:02:24.244
Did you have to meet
his every fucking need?

1:02:24.411 --> 1:02:26.330
Because I don't remember that.

1:02:28.665 --> 1:02:31.293
You have no idea what he did to me.

1:03:07.412 --> 1:03:08.705
Let us in!

1:03:09.164 --> 1:03:10.123
<i>Daddy!</i>

1:03:10.874 --> 1:03:11.875
Daddy!

1:03:12.835 --> 1:03:14.545
-Dad, please!
-Open the door, Daddy!

1:03:16.255 --> 1:03:18.423
Guys, you have to give me a second.

1:03:18.757 --> 1:03:20.217
Daddy's just sick.

1:03:23.804 --> 1:03:25.973
Daddy! Daddy, please!

1:03:27.599 --> 1:03:29.434
Daddy, what's happening to you?

1:03:29.601 --> 1:03:31.395
-Open the door!
-No!

1:03:32.437 --> 1:03:33.272
Daddy!

1:03:41.113 --> 1:03:44.324
Look at me. Daddy is very, very sick.

1:03:44.491 --> 1:03:46.827
You lock that fucking door.

1:03:46.994 --> 1:03:49.580
No matter what I do,
you don't open that door.

1:03:49.746 --> 1:03:51.039
You hear me?

1:03:53.917 --> 1:03:55.043
Lock it!

1:03:55.210 --> 1:03:56.545
<i>Lock the door!</i>

1:03:56.712 --> 1:03:59.131
<i>Daddy, Aiden's very sick.</i>

1:04:41.757 --> 1:04:44.927
If you wouldn't mind, just telling me
what you make of these.

1:05:01.735 --> 1:05:03.153
Where did you find this?

1:05:03.904 --> 1:05:05.781
Belongs to a student.

1:05:07.991 --> 1:05:09.535
Is the student Native?

1:05:10.494 --> 1:05:11.745
No.

1:05:11.912 --> 1:05:13.455
How can that be?

1:05:13.622 --> 1:05:16.375
I don't know. He isn't.

1:05:25.801 --> 1:05:27.636
This is what was in the mine.

1:05:33.100 --> 1:05:36.520
This... is what was in the mine.

1:05:40.315 --> 1:05:41.775
It's the wendigo.

1:05:41.942 --> 1:05:43.861
Translates to...

1:05:44.027 --> 1:05:48.282
a diabolical wickedness that devours mankind.

1:05:48.448 --> 1:05:51.118
According to legend,
during a brutally cold winter...

1:05:51.285 --> 1:05:54.496
a lost hunter's severe hunger
drove him to cannibalism.

1:05:55.122 --> 1:05:56.999
And after feasting on human flesh...

1:05:57.165 --> 1:05:59.626
he became crazed...

1:06:01.128 --> 1:06:05.966
and transformed into an amorphous spirit
that could take many forms.

1:06:07.467 --> 1:06:10.095
And roamed the forest for fresh victims.

1:06:10.929 --> 1:06:13.640
His insatiable appetite was never satisfied.

1:06:16.476 --> 1:06:19.271
Excuse me.
This is a myth you're talking about.

1:06:19.730 --> 1:06:21.106
For you, yeah.

1:06:21.732 --> 1:06:25.652
But a cautionary tale
to the indigenous people who believe in it.

1:06:27.738 --> 1:06:29.072
They're elusive.

1:06:29.615 --> 1:06:33.535
And known to be eternally starving,
but feasting only makes them hungrier.

1:06:33.702 --> 1:06:34.995
And weaker.

1:06:35.162 --> 1:06:37.664
Those who are unfortunate enough
to encounter one...

1:06:37.831 --> 1:06:42.169
can only kill it
when it's in its weakened state.

1:06:42.711 --> 1:06:46.673
And only by extinguishing
its beating heart...

1:06:46.840 --> 1:06:50.385
forcing it to search for another host.

1:06:52.221 --> 1:06:53.472
But it all makes sense, you see.

1:06:53.639 --> 1:06:56.350
I mean, our ancestral spirits never died.

1:06:56.517 --> 1:06:58.393
They were here long before we were...

1:06:58.560 --> 1:07:01.230
and they'll be here
long after we are gone.

1:07:03.440 --> 1:07:05.150
But now, they're angry.

1:07:18.997 --> 1:07:19.957
<i>Paul.</i>

1:07:21.625 --> 1:07:22.751
Go for Paul.

1:07:24.378 --> 1:07:26.588
<i>Pumphouse Road.
You gotta come by the tracks.</i>

1:07:30.300 --> 1:07:32.386
What? What happened?

1:07:33.136 --> 1:07:34.680
<i>We got a body out here.</i>

1:07:36.223 --> 1:07:39.393
<i>It's bad, Paul. It's real bad.</i>

1:07:55.909 --> 1:07:57.244
ID?

1:07:57.411 --> 1:07:59.204
Yeah. It's Clint Owens.

1:08:02.791 --> 1:08:04.877
I don't know where to start, Paul.

1:08:06.170 --> 1:08:07.713
Let me see it.

1:08:14.052 --> 1:08:16.095
Tell me this was a train, Jake.

1:08:19.183 --> 1:08:21.435
<i>That boy was eaten in half.</i>

1:08:21.602 --> 1:08:22.769
The fuck is going on here?

1:08:22.978 --> 1:08:25.147
I don't know, Dan.

1:08:26.648 --> 1:08:27.858
We've...

1:08:30.194 --> 1:08:32.237
Let's get back to the station...

1:08:34.448 --> 1:08:36.325
and we'll figure it out.
I'll call the mayor...

1:08:36.491 --> 1:08:39.161
and we'll get out in front of it.

1:08:45.917 --> 1:08:49.921
I'm sorry.
I'm not inclined to believe anybody...

1:08:50.087 --> 1:08:55.219
about some mythological nature beast.

1:08:55.676 --> 1:08:58.305
Things like that don't exist, Jules.

1:08:58.471 --> 1:09:00.098
Regardless of what Stokes said.

1:09:00.265 --> 1:09:05.103
There's a logical, reasonable explanation
for this.

1:09:06.563 --> 1:09:08.106
So Ellen Booth...

1:09:09.274 --> 1:09:13.946
and that... husk that you pulled out
of the Weavers'.

1:09:16.907 --> 1:09:19.117
And what about Lucas's brother, where is he?

1:09:23.330 --> 1:09:24.665
I don't know.

1:09:27.292 --> 1:09:29.336
Take me to the hospital.

1:10:15.716 --> 1:10:17.301
I'm outside your house.

1:10:18.760 --> 1:10:21.513
<i>Good. I'm wrapping up with the mayor,
then headed over.</i>

1:10:21.680 --> 1:10:23.098
<i>Just take a look around.</i>

1:10:46.538 --> 1:10:48.498
Can I get you anything else?

1:10:49.833 --> 1:10:51.001
No, thank you.

1:11:03.388 --> 1:11:08.602
<i>Lucas, do you remember
when we were talking about our moms?</i>

1:11:09.228 --> 1:11:11.104
And how they died?

1:11:14.066 --> 1:11:16.860
Well, what I didn't tell you...

1:11:17.819 --> 1:11:20.322
was that my dad died, too.

1:11:24.076 --> 1:11:25.702
How did he die?

1:11:28.372 --> 1:11:31.667
Well, he kind of did it to himself.

1:11:32.543 --> 1:11:34.670
When did he die?

1:11:35.212 --> 1:11:37.339
Not too long ago.

1:11:37.881 --> 1:11:39.633
Were you here when he died?

1:11:40.717 --> 1:11:41.718
No.

1:11:43.887 --> 1:11:44.930
Why?

1:11:46.056 --> 1:11:48.475
Didn't you love your father?

1:11:54.147 --> 1:11:58.986
Well, I moved back here
to be with my brother.

1:12:00.237 --> 1:12:02.573
We actually, we grew up in this house.

1:12:04.283 --> 1:12:05.742
And I missed him.

1:12:27.598 --> 1:12:31.935
Lucas, did they tell you at the hospital?

1:12:33.562 --> 1:12:35.480
Tell me what?

1:12:38.192 --> 1:12:40.569
Your dad died.

1:12:43.530 --> 1:12:45.741
He's not dead.

1:12:46.658 --> 1:12:48.577
Yeah, he is, Lucas.

1:12:50.662 --> 1:12:52.331
My brother, Paul...

1:12:53.248 --> 1:12:55.209
he found him in your house.

1:12:56.710 --> 1:12:59.546
No. That was my old dad.

1:13:00.172 --> 1:13:02.549
The one who was sick and mean.

1:13:04.259 --> 1:13:07.804
My new dad is with Aiden,
but Aiden doesn't understand.

1:13:08.430 --> 1:13:09.640
And he needs me.

1:13:10.432 --> 1:13:13.060
I just have to feed him,
and he'll love me.

1:13:15.812 --> 1:13:16.897
What?

1:13:45.217 --> 1:13:47.219
See? I told you.

1:13:51.807 --> 1:13:55.894
He'll come for me,
and take me to the mine to be with Aiden.

1:14:05.654 --> 1:14:07.447
He's here.

1:14:17.207 --> 1:14:18.208
Hey, Paul?

1:14:21.378 --> 1:14:22.963
Yeah, Dan, what is it?

1:14:24.631 --> 1:14:25.966
<i>There's something here.</i>

1:14:27.676 --> 1:14:29.678
I think it's in the shed.

1:14:50.073 --> 1:14:51.658
Come on. Let's go.

1:15:03.003 --> 1:15:04.546
Where are you taking me?

1:15:15.265 --> 1:15:16.808
I wanna see my brother.

1:15:49.216 --> 1:15:50.133
<i>Dan?</i>

1:15:55.138 --> 1:15:56.723
<i>Dan, do you read me?</i>

1:16:01.645 --> 1:16:04.022
There's a little kid in here.

1:16:04.815 --> 1:16:06.024
<i>What, Lucas?</i>

1:16:10.612 --> 1:16:11.864
<i>Lucas is at the house.</i>

1:16:15.325 --> 1:16:15.993
<i>Dan!</i>

1:16:18.579 --> 1:16:19.913
Dan, come in!

1:16:26.295 --> 1:16:27.296
Oh, shit.

1:16:28.005 --> 1:16:29.423
They all have locks.

1:16:54.948 --> 1:16:56.200
Goddamn it.

1:16:58.410 --> 1:16:59.411
Fuck.

1:17:02.039 --> 1:17:02.998
Paul.

1:17:08.879 --> 1:17:11.965
Lucas, stay. Don't move.

1:17:32.486 --> 1:17:33.695
Paul, no.

1:17:36.532 --> 1:17:37.824
No. Lucas!

1:18:10.607 --> 1:18:11.608
Dan.

1:18:15.946 --> 1:18:16.947
It's okay.

1:19:56.129 --> 1:19:57.130
Paul?

1:19:58.131 --> 1:19:59.132
Paul?

1:20:10.894 --> 1:20:11.895
Lucas?

1:20:37.671 --> 1:20:38.672
Paul?

1:20:41.925 --> 1:20:43.010
Oh, my God!

1:20:44.469 --> 1:20:47.222
Paul! Oh, my God. Paul!

1:20:50.017 --> 1:20:51.310
Oh, God.

1:21:07.284 --> 1:21:08.285
Paul...

1:21:09.786 --> 1:21:13.248
Paul, I have to move you. Paul.

1:21:17.377 --> 1:21:18.670
I'm gonna move you.

1:21:18.837 --> 1:21:19.838
To where?

1:21:21.798 --> 1:21:22.799
Come on.

1:21:25.344 --> 1:21:26.678
Is Lucas dead?

1:21:26.845 --> 1:21:28.514
Be still. Be still.

1:21:30.390 --> 1:21:32.267
He went to the mine.
I'm gonna go after him.

1:21:32.434 --> 1:21:33.435
What?

1:21:33.602 --> 1:21:34.978
He thinks that's where Aiden is.

1:21:35.145 --> 1:21:37.564
No, you can't do that.
You can't...

1:21:38.190 --> 1:21:39.900
I have to. I have to go find him.

1:21:40.067 --> 1:21:41.443
Not by yourself.

1:21:42.778 --> 1:21:44.238
You need a doctor.

1:21:44.404 --> 1:21:45.864
I'm coming with you.

1:21:47.199 --> 1:21:48.283
Get my gun.

1:21:50.869 --> 1:21:52.955
You're not leaving me.

1:22:17.563 --> 1:22:19.106
This is Julia Meadows.

1:22:19.773 --> 1:22:21.817
Paul and I are at Greymouth Mine.

1:22:22.192 --> 1:22:23.694
He needs an ambulance.

1:23:07.279 --> 1:23:08.280
Lucas?

1:23:48.362 --> 1:23:49.363
Lucas?

1:25:28.962 --> 1:25:29.796
Lucas?

1:25:30.255 --> 1:25:31.298
Lucas.

1:25:32.633 --> 1:25:33.634
He's...

1:25:36.762 --> 1:25:37.930
What?

1:25:38.096 --> 1:25:39.348
Go back.

1:25:39.515 --> 1:25:40.516
Go.

1:30:35.185 --> 1:30:37.020
He's gonna be okay.

1:30:37.187 --> 1:30:38.647
He's just sick.

1:30:42.609 --> 1:30:44.027
Lucas, listen to me.

1:30:46.154 --> 1:30:48.782
He is never gonna get better.

1:30:49.533 --> 1:30:50.742
Yes, he is.

1:30:50.909 --> 1:30:52.703
Lucas, he's not.

1:30:53.412 --> 1:30:54.663
It's too late for him.

1:30:54.830 --> 1:30:55.747
He's sick...

1:30:56.498 --> 1:30:58.584
but he'll be better, I promise.

1:31:02.713 --> 1:31:04.298
Lucas, listen to me.

1:31:04.464 --> 1:31:06.925
You know he's not gonna get any better.

1:31:08.051 --> 1:31:10.387
I need to know that you understand.

1:31:24.985 --> 1:31:28.447
Look away. Look away, Lucas!

1:31:30.115 --> 1:31:31.325
It's okay.

1:31:48.550 --> 1:31:50.219
I'm so sorry.

1:32:45.357 --> 1:32:47.234
What are we gonna do with him?

1:32:49.862 --> 1:32:52.197
Keep him. For now.

1:32:54.449 --> 1:32:55.742
We have no choice.

1:32:59.079 --> 1:33:01.623
It's like living with a tiger cub.

1:33:01.790 --> 1:33:06.086
You know what he's going to grow into.

1:33:10.799 --> 1:33:14.011
Do you think you could kill
something you love?

1:33:31.445 --> 1:33:32.196
There.

1:33:33.071 --> 1:33:34.239
Come on, let's go.

1:33:37.743 --> 1:33:40.454
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'll catch up to you.
