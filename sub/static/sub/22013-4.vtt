00:01.001 --> 00:03.137
You're witnessing
the power of Empire.

00:03.171 --> 00:05.706
I'm Cookie Lyon, baby.
I'm unforgettable.

00:05.739 --> 00:07.308
Catch all-new episodes
Wednesdays.

00:07.341 --> 00:08.976
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:09.009 --> 00:11.812
Star, The Gifted,
and Lethal Weapon.

00:11.845 --> 00:14.415
That was the best idea
you've had all day.

00:14.448 --> 00:15.549
Only on Fox.

00:17.685 --> 00:19.887
-Previously on Empire...
-I'm gonna spot you $10 mil

00:19.920 --> 00:20.988
for your 20 For 20.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.390
I could do another "Drip Drop"
in my sleep,

00:22.423 --> 00:23.557
but I need to go harder.

00:23.591 --> 00:24.692
She's not used to you yet.

00:24.725 --> 00:25.826
You were gone five months.

00:25.859 --> 00:26.827
PAMELA:
You don't need your attorney.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.062
I'm off duty.

00:28.096 --> 00:29.230
I trust you, right?

00:29.263 --> 00:30.664
My father has
a serious brain injury.

00:30.698 --> 00:31.832
We got to keep it under wraps.

00:31.865 --> 00:32.866
DIANA: Get a grip, Angelo.

00:32.900 --> 00:35.536
Put this floundering self-pity
to rest.

00:35.569 --> 00:36.870
It doesn't take
a rocket scientist

00:36.904 --> 00:39.073
to figure out
you're up to something.

00:39.107 --> 00:41.041
Was I a violent man?

00:41.075 --> 00:42.876
COOKIE:
I was gone for 17 years

00:42.910 --> 00:44.678
because I was in prison.

00:44.712 --> 00:46.046
I want to know everything.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.749
What's up, y'all?

00:48.782 --> 00:50.218
Welcome back to 106 & Park,
BET's top ten live.

00:50.251 --> 00:52.052
Now, I need y'all
to do me a favor.

00:52.086 --> 00:54.255
-Y'all ready to do me a favor?
-(applause and cheering on TV)

00:54.288 --> 00:57.558
That's my man up there.

00:57.591 --> 00:59.393
(on TV):
All right, mark down this date,

00:59.427 --> 01:02.430
this time, who you're with,
where you are, because

01:02.463 --> 01:04.198
this brother from Philly,
Lucious Lyon,

01:04.232 --> 01:05.966
-is making his TV debut...
-Change the channel.

01:05.999 --> 01:07.468
...and history.

01:07.501 --> 01:10.271
Uh, I-I was watching that.

01:10.304 --> 01:12.873
-Yeah, now we're watching this.
-CHYNA: Yo.

01:12.906 --> 01:16.043
-Don't even bother.
She got it on lock. -Ugh.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.478
Nah, man.

01:17.511 --> 01:18.779
Poundcake, right?

01:18.812 --> 01:21.048
LUCIOUS:
Wait a minute. Poundcake?

01:21.081 --> 01:23.417
Why-why was her name Poundcake?

01:23.451 --> 01:27.121
Look, how you want me
to tell the story? Huh?

01:27.155 --> 01:29.223
You want it blow by blow,
with me telling you

01:29.257 --> 01:31.058
how every bitch
got her wack-ass nickname,

01:31.091 --> 01:33.060
or you just gonna
let me tell the story?

01:33.093 --> 01:35.729
I mean, ever since I've been
out, you've never cared

01:35.763 --> 01:37.231
about my prison life.

01:37.265 --> 01:39.800
That was Lucious,
but I'm asking.

01:39.833 --> 01:42.170
It's important. I need to know
everything that happened.

01:42.203 --> 01:44.838
All right.

01:44.872 --> 01:47.908
Well, then, let me back up
and set the scene for you.

01:47.941 --> 01:51.078
I got real cool with Chyna

01:51.111 --> 01:53.281
and all the Philly girls,
of course.

01:53.314 --> 01:56.417
And, uh, we was cool
with the Latina chicks

01:56.450 --> 02:00.488
and was cool with the Chinese,
Japanese, or the Vietnamese.

02:00.521 --> 02:02.356
Whatever. The Asians.

02:02.390 --> 02:04.024
Child, the Asians.

02:04.057 --> 02:05.626
And we did not get along

02:05.659 --> 02:07.828
with them white chicks

02:07.861 --> 02:11.098
or the wild-ass Jamaicans.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.100
And Chyna had the...

02:13.133 --> 02:15.603
Ugh. She had a serious beef
with them D.C. girls, man.

02:15.636 --> 02:18.939
I don't know what it was, but

02:18.972 --> 02:21.141
they was wild, man.
They had nicknames

02:21.175 --> 02:25.112
like Yunk Yunk, Butterball,
and Poundcake.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.847
Look, I ain't trying
to disrespect you,

02:26.880 --> 02:29.450
but I'm gonna politely ask you
to turn that back

02:29.483 --> 02:31.785
-to BET 'cause I was watching
that. -Oh, well, since you asked

02:31.819 --> 02:33.687
so pretty,
I'll politely tell you no.

02:33.721 --> 02:36.123
Now move your bama ass
out my sight lines.

02:36.156 --> 02:39.126
-LUCIOUS: So, what'd you do?
-COOKIE: What you think I did?

02:39.159 --> 02:42.496
(groaning, indistinct shouting)

02:46.900 --> 02:50.137
Then she leaned down to my ear,
talking about,

02:50.170 --> 02:52.373
"You know why I'm in here?
For eating

02:52.406 --> 02:55.443
bitches like you for breakfast
and going on about my day."

02:58.846 --> 03:00.648
(Cookie yells)

03:00.681 --> 03:02.483
LUCIOUS:
And she cut you?

03:02.516 --> 03:04.017
She sure did.

03:04.051 --> 03:05.886
That wasn't my first fight,
Lucious.

03:05.919 --> 03:08.522
And it sure as hell
wasn't my last.

03:08.556 --> 03:11.225
But there were things
that happened to me in prison

03:11.259 --> 03:13.261
that cut deeper than a knife.

03:13.294 --> 03:15.396
Believe that.

03:15.429 --> 03:17.798
*

03:22.436 --> 03:25.739
-Lucious can't see me like this.
-So don't pick a fight

03:25.773 --> 03:28.909
with a chick named Poundcake
day before a visit.

03:28.942 --> 03:31.345
You're lucky nobody told,
or you'd be in the hole.

03:31.379 --> 03:33.614
Ouch. Can you...?
Do you know what you're doing?

03:33.647 --> 03:35.416
Are you questioning
my skill set?

03:35.449 --> 03:37.451
-I was good enough for Lil' Kim.
-Just go easy.

03:37.485 --> 03:38.886
-Come...
-Still sore.

03:38.919 --> 03:40.688
-What the hell is this?
-Nothing. -Nothing.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.190
-Huh?
-Nothing.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.225
-It's contraband.
-I know, but my husband's coming

03:45.259 --> 03:46.627
-to visit me today.
-Well, he's gonna have

03:46.660 --> 03:48.362
to see you
the way God made you--

03:48.396 --> 03:49.963
hood rat turned
into a punching bag.

03:49.997 --> 03:53.267
Wipe that off your face
before I throw you in the hole.

03:53.301 --> 03:55.569
Beauty tips, huh, Chyna?
(scoffs)

03:58.972 --> 04:00.941
COOKIE:
Yeah, she snitched,

04:00.974 --> 04:03.744
but her fat ass was the least
of my worries.

04:03.777 --> 04:06.647
(Cookie laughs)

04:06.680 --> 04:09.617
-(door opens) -Hey.
-LUCIOUS: Like I said, I'm gonna

04:09.650 --> 04:11.952
-take care of you for this.
-(Cookie sighs)

04:11.985 --> 04:14.855
-Hey. -I tried to get us
a little privacy, but...

04:16.824 --> 04:18.992
It's okay.

04:19.026 --> 04:20.994
-It's not o... What happened
to her face?! -I'm okay.

04:21.028 --> 04:23.063
-Lucious. Lucious, come here.
-(bangs on table)

04:23.096 --> 04:25.966
Look, our time is too precious
to be thinking about that.

04:25.999 --> 04:28.436
Look, I saw you on BET.

04:28.469 --> 04:30.938
You was so fine up there.
(laughs)

04:30.971 --> 04:33.240
-That was nothing.
-Oh, come on now, Lucious.

04:33.273 --> 04:36.243
Don't downplay it like that.
It was everything.

04:36.276 --> 04:39.012
It was exactly what AJ said--

04:39.046 --> 04:41.148
"Remember where you are
at this moment."

04:41.181 --> 04:43.517
So all I'm thinking about is
where I'm at and where you are.

04:43.551 --> 04:45.152
-And where...
-Hey, look, Lu...

04:45.185 --> 04:48.822
Lucious, I'm gonna be here
for a long time, okay?

04:48.856 --> 04:51.359
So might as well get used to it.

04:51.392 --> 04:54.294
I can deal with
what comes at me in here

04:54.328 --> 04:58.466
as long as I know you're out
there growing what we built.

04:58.499 --> 05:03.303
'Cause it's you and me--
Cookie and Lucious forever.

05:04.872 --> 05:07.608
Tell me about my babies.

05:07.641 --> 05:11.011
How are my babies doing?

05:11.044 --> 05:13.714
Well, Andre-- he's a little...

05:15.383 --> 05:17.518
Something not right.

05:17.551 --> 05:19.787
But Jamal-- he's been good,
and he...

05:19.820 --> 05:22.623
he wants to see you
for his birthday.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.525
Mm, no, Lucious.

05:24.558 --> 05:28.796
This ain't no place
for no boy for his birthday.

05:28.829 --> 05:32.866
Not unless he really want
to come, just, I guess.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.735
LUCIOUS:
I remember this.

05:37.738 --> 05:41.542
I brought Jamal
to see you the next time.

05:46.447 --> 05:48.982
Wait. Am I remembering this
correctly?

05:49.016 --> 05:52.386
You did bring Jamal, but...

05:52.420 --> 05:54.522
(indistinct chatter)

05:58.258 --> 06:01.128
Where's your father?

06:03.130 --> 06:05.766
LUCIOUS:
I never came back, did I?

06:05.799 --> 06:10.170
I guess it was just hard
for you to see me like that.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.172
It hurt.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.041
It hurt me to the core,

06:14.074 --> 06:17.411
but it made me self-sufficient,

06:17.445 --> 06:20.013
and, on the inside, it-it...
it made me strong.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.615
It made me hard.

06:21.649 --> 06:24.084
That's a sad lesson
to learn by yourself.

06:25.986 --> 06:28.088
He should have been there
for you.

06:28.121 --> 06:30.090
He should have.

06:30.123 --> 06:32.926
He should have
after everything you sacrificed.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.361
-He who?
-He.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.764
Him. Me. Lucious.

06:36.797 --> 06:40.868
If he loved you
half as much as he says he did,

06:40.901 --> 06:42.436
he would have never
abandoned you.

06:42.470 --> 06:45.973
He would have... put you first.

06:46.006 --> 06:49.643
I'm gonna be a better man
than he was.

06:49.677 --> 06:53.380
I'm gonna make it up to you
for everything he did wrong.

06:53.413 --> 06:56.383
(sighs)

06:56.416 --> 06:58.385
How can you make up
for something

06:58.418 --> 07:00.420
you don't even remember?

07:01.655 --> 07:04.424
(Cookie sighs)

07:04.458 --> 07:07.427
The sun's up.
I got to get ready for work.

07:07.461 --> 07:10.330
Okay, well, maybe you're right.

07:10.363 --> 07:13.066
Maybe I can't make up for
a yesterday I don't remember,

07:13.100 --> 07:16.069
but I can make today right.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.805
I can go down to Empire with you

07:17.838 --> 07:19.607
-and support you.
-No, no, no, no, no.

07:19.640 --> 07:22.776
Remember you said it didn't go
so well when Jamal took you.

07:22.810 --> 07:24.444
It wasn't that bad, and...

07:24.478 --> 07:27.014
-Okay, maybe it was.
-(both laugh)

07:27.047 --> 07:29.817
What I'm saying is,
I'd like to try it again.

07:29.850 --> 07:33.320
And I think, with your help,
I could make it through it.

07:33.353 --> 07:35.455
With my help?

07:38.358 --> 07:40.694
Okay. Well, then, let's go.

07:40.728 --> 07:43.864
CLAUDIA:
Where are we going?

07:43.897 --> 07:47.400
Dwight. Cookie. What'd I miss?

07:55.008 --> 07:56.777
-(cheering and applause)
-MAN: Welcome back.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.145
WOMAN:
Nice to have you back, Lucious.

07:58.178 --> 08:00.514
-Nice to have you back, Lucious.
-Welcome back, Lucious.

08:00.548 --> 08:02.149
-WOMAN: Looking good, Lucious.
-MAN 2: Happy to have you back.

08:02.182 --> 08:04.985
MAN 3:
Look out. Here he comes.

08:05.018 --> 08:06.987
If this gets too stressful
for Dwight, I'm gonna...

08:07.020 --> 08:09.523
I-I don't want
to hear Dwight stuff, okay?

08:09.557 --> 08:11.224
-Wow.
-This is the house

08:11.258 --> 08:13.827
that Lucious built.
Our house, our rules.

08:13.861 --> 08:16.129
-Lucious! Lucious, hi!
-(Lucious laughs)

08:16.163 --> 08:18.699
-It's so nice to see you.
-COOKIE: That's Becky.

08:18.732 --> 08:21.635
Becky was promoted
to head of A&R after

08:21.669 --> 08:24.171
-all those years
of being your assistant. -Wow.

08:24.204 --> 08:27.675
Well, you know what they say.
Cream always rises to the top.

08:27.708 --> 08:30.744
-Congratulations. -Thank you.
It is so good to see you.

08:30.778 --> 08:32.312
-You, too. -You say
I'm reckless, but I hid him

08:32.345 --> 08:33.914
when I brought him here.
What was the sense

08:33.947 --> 08:36.049
if Mom was just gonna walk him
in the front door?

08:36.083 --> 08:38.686
-Yeah. What the hell is she
doing? -These came for you.

08:38.719 --> 08:40.353
There's a card in there, too.

08:40.387 --> 08:42.189
Who they from?

08:42.222 --> 08:44.357
Yeah, thank you.
None of your business.

08:44.391 --> 08:46.994
"For tomorrow?"
Who you meeting with tomorrow?

08:47.027 --> 08:51.231
Hey. I need all hands on deck
keeping our family secret.

08:51.264 --> 08:54.201
-Lucious! What's up?!
How you doing? -Huh?

08:54.234 --> 08:55.903
-Good to see you!
-(laughing): Hi.

08:55.936 --> 08:58.205
Welcome back.
Where your suit?

08:58.238 --> 08:59.907
You looking like a...
hippie and stuff.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.541
But you look good.
You look good.

09:01.575 --> 09:03.944
-Why didn't you keep him home?
-Because he wants to be

09:03.977 --> 09:06.614
a part of all of this,
and I couldn't say no.

09:06.647 --> 09:08.616
So we'll just keep it
short and sweet.

09:08.649 --> 09:11.218
We'll have him listen
to Hakeem's song,

09:11.251 --> 09:13.553
-and we'll send him home
with Nurse Ratchet. -Well, Mom,

09:13.587 --> 09:15.088
Hakeem's not even here.
He's at his house

09:15.122 --> 09:16.523
arguing with Anika
about Bella's birthday.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.258
Uh-uh, uh-uh-uh.
Tell him to get

09:18.291 --> 09:20.694
his ass down here.
He can bring my grandbaby.

09:20.728 --> 09:22.730
Can y'all believe
she having a birthday already?

09:22.763 --> 09:25.032
-(laughs) -Yeah. Time flies.
-COOKIE: I know.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.334
Come on.
I need help with your dad.

09:31.171 --> 09:33.641
-(classical music playing)
-DIANA: Amnesia?

09:33.674 --> 09:35.643
Like in a soap opera.

09:35.676 --> 09:38.946
(laughs)
He don't even know his name.

09:38.979 --> 09:40.313
He wants them
to call him Dwight.

09:40.347 --> 09:41.782
-You're not serious.
-I'm serious.

09:41.815 --> 09:44.718
He has migraines, outbursts.

09:44.752 --> 09:48.321
He treats his nurse like family
and his family like strangers.

09:48.355 --> 09:50.958
Hakeem never breathed
a word of this.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.926
And how did you get
this information?

09:52.960 --> 09:55.062
In bed with your catamite?

09:55.095 --> 09:57.564
-(laughs)
-Excuse me? Catamite?

09:57.597 --> 09:59.466
DIANA: It's a line
from an Anthony Burgess novel.

09:59.499 --> 10:02.970
Okay, so you found your razor,
you made it to your meeting.

10:03.003 --> 10:05.072
That does not entitle you
to be a snob.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.407
Right. I'm just saying,

10:07.440 --> 10:10.010
how do we know
he's not playing you... cuz?

10:10.043 --> 10:13.413
Because I'm not like you... cuz.

10:13.446 --> 10:16.283
'Cause when I sleep with a Lyon,
I get the goods.

10:16.316 --> 10:17.851
-And there it is.
-DIANA: Thank you for sharing.

10:17.885 --> 10:20.520
-That's good work.
-Thank you.

10:20.553 --> 10:21.955
Much appreciated, and, Angelo,

10:21.989 --> 10:23.857
the running commentary
from the sidelines

10:23.891 --> 10:25.358
is interesting.

10:25.392 --> 10:27.194
But why don't you do
something useful?

10:28.228 --> 10:30.163
-Really.
-(Warren laughs)

10:30.197 --> 10:31.364
(sighs)

10:33.466 --> 10:35.335
You want to use some ear plugs?

10:35.368 --> 10:39.272
No. No, I want to participate
and not really hide.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.774
-But thank you.
-HAKEEM: Hit it, Rekkhan.

10:40.808 --> 10:42.710
-(music plays)
* Shut up, shut up

10:42.743 --> 10:44.444
* Hey, shut up, trick,
that means don't talk *

10:44.477 --> 10:46.179
* Don't call me,
my phone's off *

10:46.213 --> 10:47.314
* I'm good now,
that's your loss *

10:47.347 --> 10:49.116
* I'm self-made, my own boss

10:49.149 --> 10:50.884
* Now who's trippin'?
My roof missin' *

10:50.918 --> 10:53.120
* My jewels glistening, who's
listening? Ya heard that *

10:53.153 --> 10:55.823
* My new whip got two engines,
that's too expensive *

10:55.856 --> 10:57.657
* Lower ya voice 'cause I don't
wanna hear what you sayin' *

10:57.691 --> 10:59.192
* I'm tired of talkin'

10:59.226 --> 11:01.862
* Ain't no conversation,
hope you understand *

11:01.895 --> 11:03.496
* I don't like you,
you, you, you *

11:03.530 --> 11:06.867
* You're cool,
but the rest of y'all... *

11:06.900 --> 11:10.170
* Shut up, bitch, ooh...

11:10.203 --> 11:13.874
* Shut up, shut up

11:13.907 --> 11:16.143
* Uh...

11:16.176 --> 11:18.979
-(music stops)
-What you think about that, Dad?

11:19.012 --> 11:22.049
Does it remind you of Jay-Z
on Blueprint?

11:22.082 --> 11:26.019
I mean, I don't know much
about architecture,

11:26.053 --> 11:27.420
but I was really inspired by

11:27.454 --> 11:29.222
the amount of effort
you've put into that.

11:29.256 --> 11:31.558
BECKY: Okay, Hakeem,
that definitely was not

11:31.591 --> 11:33.193
the song you were supposed
to be working on.

11:33.226 --> 11:35.562
'Cause I got to keep it real,
track by track.

11:35.595 --> 11:37.497
Exposing hypocrisy in democracy.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.733
What do you think, Ma?

11:39.767 --> 11:42.669
Uh, there were some nice things
in it, son.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.504
You know what? Why don't you go
get something to eat?

11:44.537 --> 11:47.340
Come on, y'all. Marcel.
And, uh, let us discuss it.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.743
All right, Dad.

11:49.777 --> 11:52.012
(indistinct chatter)

11:52.045 --> 11:53.513
What was that?

11:53.546 --> 11:55.916
-I do not know.
-What? You didn't like that?

11:55.949 --> 11:58.018
I just bet $100 million
of other peoples' money

11:58.051 --> 12:00.754
that Empire would showcase
a legacy

12:00.788 --> 12:02.522
with that boy's album
as the Alpha

12:02.555 --> 12:04.091
and Jamal as the Omega.

12:04.124 --> 12:06.226
But guess what.
That wasn't it.

12:06.259 --> 12:09.096
I mean, I really didn't like
the-the nature of the song,

12:09.129 --> 12:11.231
you know,
but he was so passionate

12:11.264 --> 12:12.966
in how he was delivering that.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.702
BECKY: You know, Lucious,
you just came back

12:15.735 --> 12:18.105
at the perfect time
because you always come up

12:18.138 --> 12:20.240
with some crazy, Machiavellian
scheme to save the day.

12:20.273 --> 12:21.741
Like, remember that time

12:21.775 --> 12:24.211
Diddy canceled on us
24 hours right before

12:24.244 --> 12:26.246
-the Radio City Music Hall show?
-Uh, no, no.

12:26.279 --> 12:27.915
Not-not, uh, Radio City.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.316
Um, just last night, Dad was

12:29.349 --> 12:30.750
telling me
about one of the concerts

12:30.784 --> 12:32.485
he had in Philly,
and you're right, Pop.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.721
What you did there was exactly
what you said we should do

12:34.754 --> 12:36.556
with 20 For 20.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.291
Oh.

12:40.360 --> 12:43.897
Um...

12:43.931 --> 12:45.132
exactly.

12:45.165 --> 12:47.067
Here's the thing.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.803
All of Empire's artists want to
be a part of this 20 For 20, so

12:49.837 --> 12:52.439
let's get 'em out in front of us
right away, see what they got.

12:52.472 --> 12:54.507
Tell them to bring their
sharpest weapon to the fight,

12:54.541 --> 12:56.977
because they are all competing
for the Alpha spot,

12:57.010 --> 12:59.947
and only one is gonna be left
standing.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.648
-(laughs)
-COOKIE: I like that.

13:01.681 --> 13:03.116
A fight to the death.

13:04.818 --> 13:08.021
Well, let the games begin.

13:08.055 --> 13:11.224
You did it again, Lucious.
Genius.

13:15.328 --> 13:17.364
* Leave 'em in the dust,
arrivederci *

13:17.397 --> 13:20.033
* One thing that's for certain,
I don't do the circus *

13:20.067 --> 13:22.202
* With you clowns,
I close the curtains *

13:22.235 --> 13:24.671
-* I'm just out here working
-* Working

13:24.704 --> 13:26.206
-* Yeah, you see I'm surfing
-(whooping)

13:26.239 --> 13:27.674
* Swimming with the sharks,
and, nah *

13:27.707 --> 13:28.842
* It never made me nervous.

13:28.876 --> 13:30.343
-HAKEEM: Good job.
-COOKIE: I really like his look.

13:30.377 --> 13:33.280
Mm-hmm. Let's see what
we working with today.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.515
-Hello. -What's with all
this fight-to-death, Ma?

13:35.548 --> 13:37.117
I gave you gold.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.352
Boy, right now, I'm not
your mother. I'm the label.

13:39.386 --> 13:41.321
And what you gave me
ain't gonna cut it. Excuse me.

13:41.354 --> 13:44.491
BECKY: So, you're all
Empire's premier artists,

13:44.524 --> 13:45.825
and what we're looking for is...

13:45.859 --> 13:48.695
I need somebody else
to launch the 20 For 20, okay?

13:48.728 --> 13:51.865
So that means all of you are
competing for the Alpha spot.

13:51.899 --> 13:55.802
-You, too, Jamal. -Well, I'm
already Omega, boo, so I'm good.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.704
Uh, we past that.
Everybody's competing.

13:57.737 --> 13:59.172
TIANA:
The creative process doesn't

13:59.206 --> 14:01.208
-work like that, Cookie.
-Well, it does today,

14:01.241 --> 14:05.578
sweetness, especially if Empire
decides to shelve your project.

14:05.612 --> 14:07.814
You know what?
That's exactly what I will do

14:07.847 --> 14:09.716
to anyone who hands in crap.

14:09.749 --> 14:12.352
Mom, are you ser...
Y'all trippin'.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.754
-Y'all have fun with that,
enjoy. -COOKIE: Good-bye, boy,

14:14.787 --> 14:16.089
'cause don't nobody
have time for that.

14:16.123 --> 14:18.491
-Bye, Ma. -I don't have time
for your poor,

14:18.525 --> 14:21.861
your tired.
I want your passion, your pain,

14:21.895 --> 14:24.431
your drive.
Show me how you fight.

14:24.464 --> 14:27.200
-(Tiana scoffs)
-(overlapping chatter)

14:27.234 --> 14:29.869
Yes, showtime.

14:29.903 --> 14:33.206
Cookie, this is just too much
and too fast for Dwight. I...

14:33.240 --> 14:35.408
Okay, didn't you say that, um,

14:35.442 --> 14:38.111
he should tell us
what he wants and needs?

14:38.145 --> 14:39.412
Well, he already said
he wants to be here, so

14:39.446 --> 14:41.848
why don't you go home
and take a load off?

14:41.881 --> 14:43.550
I'll take it from here, okay?

14:43.583 --> 14:45.218
Do what nurses do, child,
I don't know.

14:45.252 --> 14:47.120
(clears throat)
Who's... who's first?

14:47.154 --> 14:49.689
-Uh, Tiana.
-Mm-hmm, and she...

14:49.722 --> 14:52.559
is-is-is... who is this?
Is she after her?

14:52.592 --> 14:56.029
* Put that sexy on 'em,
put that sexy on 'em *

14:56.063 --> 14:58.365
* When you're fed up
and you been giving your all *

14:58.398 --> 15:00.934
* He don't wanna
return your call *

15:00.968 --> 15:04.437
-* Put that sexy on 'em,
put that sexy on 'em * -Yeah!

15:04.471 --> 15:06.606
* He be wildin' out

15:06.639 --> 15:08.741
* You don't know
what he take you for *

15:08.775 --> 15:10.543
* Ladies, I think it's time
to show 'em *

15:10.577 --> 15:12.145
* What he'll be missin'

15:12.179 --> 15:14.047
* All the ladies in the club,
throw your hands up *

15:14.081 --> 15:17.150
-Yeah!
-* Shake it in his direction

15:17.184 --> 15:18.918
* Let him know what it is, show
him what's he's neglecting *

15:18.952 --> 15:21.154
-Yeah!
-* Throw it like that

15:21.188 --> 15:22.555
* Like you trying
to get a check *

15:22.589 --> 15:24.724
* You know how a dog
like to chase the cat *

15:24.757 --> 15:26.960
-* Ladies, turn it up
-* Turn it up

15:26.994 --> 15:30.163
* T-Turn it up, when yo' man
don't wanna do you right *

15:30.197 --> 15:31.931
* Just throw that sexy on 'em

15:31.965 --> 15:34.567
-Yeah, Tiana! -* Rather hang out
with his friends all night *

15:34.601 --> 15:36.603
-* Just throw that sexy on 'em
-* Throw that sexy on 'em

15:36.636 --> 15:39.006
-Yeah! -* If he looking at her
with wandering eyes *

15:39.039 --> 15:40.573
* Throw that sexy on 'em

15:40.607 --> 15:42.242
* Got your heels on, face beat

15:42.275 --> 15:44.644
* Just throw that sexy on 'em.

15:44.677 --> 15:46.279
All right, girl!

15:46.313 --> 15:47.680
(cheering)

15:47.714 --> 15:50.483
You better secure
the number one spot!

15:50.517 --> 15:52.252
What you think?

15:52.285 --> 15:54.921
I mean, she sure can
shake a branch,

15:54.954 --> 15:57.790
um, but I don't think
she's the root of the tree.

15:57.824 --> 16:00.027
-Hmm.
-So she's not the Alpha for me.

16:00.060 --> 16:04.164
-Okay, that is cold but true.
-Yeah, I agree. Next!

16:04.197 --> 16:08.301
PORSHA:
Uh-uh, not Tory Ash, mm-mm.

16:08.335 --> 16:09.969
COOKIE:
Sorry, but the... (laughs)

16:10.003 --> 16:12.772
The first one out the gate
cannot be

16:12.805 --> 16:14.441
a white girl.
I am so sorry.

16:14.474 --> 16:15.975
-Thank you but no, thank you.
-LUCIOUS: Wait.

16:16.009 --> 16:18.111
That sounds really unfair.

16:18.145 --> 16:20.447
Oh, what,
you gonna talk about how unfair

16:20.480 --> 16:24.517
affirmative action is now?
Please. Sorry, not sorry. Next.

16:24.551 --> 16:26.719
* Leave 'em in the dust,
arrivederci... *

16:26.753 --> 16:28.388
So, here we have Paintbruh.
He made some noise

16:28.421 --> 16:29.889
as a street rapper
and was selected

16:29.922 --> 16:31.724
for this year's
XXL Freshman Class.

16:31.758 --> 16:34.494
* I'm just out here working,
look at me, I'm surfing *

16:34.527 --> 16:36.496
* Swimming with the sharks, no

16:36.529 --> 16:38.798
* It never make me nervous,
okay, okay, okay *

16:38.831 --> 16:41.034
* Perfect, coming
for your crown 'cause... *

16:41.068 --> 16:42.735
-(grunts)
-COOKIE: Hey! Hey!

16:42.769 --> 16:44.737
-Hey, security!
-This punk stole my beat, man.

16:44.771 --> 16:46.873
I'm not...
No, y'all trippin'...

16:46.906 --> 16:47.974
-I didn't take no beat.
-What you talking about?

16:48.007 --> 16:49.008
Man, get off me, though.

16:49.042 --> 16:50.243
You're a beat jacker?

16:50.277 --> 16:51.478
-Bye-bye.
-I didn't take...

16:51.511 --> 16:54.047
-Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
-That's crazy. All right.

16:54.081 --> 16:55.582
Wow. This is so wrong.

16:55.615 --> 16:57.350
-No. That's a no.
-File 13.

16:57.384 --> 16:59.719
-Next!
-This is wrong.

17:01.888 --> 17:04.657
-(sighs)
-(door opens)

17:04.691 --> 17:06.093
Your mom has gone
full Lannister.

17:06.126 --> 17:07.660
She's chopping heads down there.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.262
That's why I'm not down there.

17:09.296 --> 17:11.931
Not to be about
that competition life.

17:11.964 --> 17:15.902
But even if I was, I have
literally nothing to present.

17:15.935 --> 17:18.037
What about that song that
you played me the other night?

17:18.071 --> 17:21.007
That duet. That was the hottest
song I've heard in forever.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.542
Oh, yeah, but that was
about addiction,

17:22.575 --> 17:24.944
and I want to make an album
of all love songs.

17:24.977 --> 17:26.846
Well, love can be just
as powerful a drug

17:26.879 --> 17:28.115
as any other substance.

17:28.148 --> 17:29.782
-(laughs) True.
-It's two people

17:29.816 --> 17:31.584
singing about their addiction
to love.

17:31.618 --> 17:34.721
Plus, didn't Lucious and Mary J.
Blige do a duet back in the day?

17:36.789 --> 17:39.226
(laughs) My mom said wasn't
no white girl gonna be

17:39.259 --> 17:42.895
-the Alpha, right? -Well, there
ain't no mountain high enough.

17:42.929 --> 17:46.399
I actually like that.
Let's try it. Come on.

17:49.136 --> 17:50.937
No. No. No, no, no, no.

17:50.970 --> 17:53.072
Remember, I said
the motorcycle needs to come

17:53.106 --> 17:55.408
before the guitars
and the doves, okay?

17:55.442 --> 17:57.244
And please remember
to charge all of this

17:57.277 --> 17:59.312
to Hakeem Lyon's account.
And the balloons. Thank you.

17:59.346 --> 18:01.648
-Party planning with the Lyons,
are we? -Oh, dear God.

18:01.681 --> 18:03.550
(laughs)
Last time I saw you,

18:03.583 --> 18:05.218
you were
in my mother's living room,

18:05.252 --> 18:08.255
pledging your loyalty
to Team Dubois.

18:08.288 --> 18:10.390
Well, your mother let me rot
in jail for five months,

18:10.423 --> 18:12.225
so she can kiss my ass.

18:12.259 --> 18:13.626
Look, I know
Cookie got you out of jail,

18:13.660 --> 18:15.228
but do you really think

18:15.262 --> 18:17.630
that the Lyons have
your best interest at heart?

18:17.664 --> 18:19.732
I mean, they bit you before.
Trust.

18:19.766 --> 18:22.068
They will bite you again.

18:22.101 --> 18:25.071
So, when you're ready
to bite back,

18:25.104 --> 18:27.474
why don't you hit me up?

18:29.008 --> 18:30.543
I'm for real.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.256
* Proud to say
I'm from the motherland... *

18:43.290 --> 18:44.524
Kendra took South By by storm.

18:44.557 --> 18:47.026
She every nerd's
favorite Empire artist.

18:47.059 --> 18:48.861
* 'Cause now they all want
the braids and the dreadlocks *

18:48.895 --> 18:53.200
* Get the money just to keep
the curves that I've got. *

18:53.233 --> 18:55.001
It's a concept album.

18:55.034 --> 18:57.304
Black female warriors
colonize Mars,

18:57.337 --> 19:00.207
except it takes place
on a spaceship in 2047.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.974
-Uh...
-Question.

19:02.008 --> 19:03.843
Was there a problem on Earth

19:03.876 --> 19:06.613
that the warriors had to leave?

19:06.646 --> 19:08.615
-We're actually supposed to...
-Okay. All right, sweetheart.

19:08.648 --> 19:11.784
All right, baby, well, we're
not gonna make the remix of

19:11.818 --> 19:13.786
Ziggy Stardust and Kunta Kinte.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.855
I'm sorry. Thank you.

19:15.888 --> 19:18.658
Power to the people, though.

19:18.691 --> 19:20.560
I think you're hurting
a lot of people's feelings.

19:20.593 --> 19:24.130
Lucious, look, we are not in
the game of building confidence.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.198
Okay?
This is the music industry,

19:25.232 --> 19:26.833
and we're on a deadline.

19:26.866 --> 19:29.669
-Next!
-(tapping on table)

19:29.702 --> 19:31.504
Send 'em through, baby.

19:31.538 --> 19:32.972
* Come up and rise...

19:33.005 --> 19:34.874
BECKY: So, Tommy's won
more Grammys than

19:34.907 --> 19:38.211
any other Empire artist--
three on his last album.

19:38.245 --> 19:39.312
* The one

19:39.346 --> 19:41.548
* The father and the son.

19:45.084 --> 19:47.987
(applause and cheering)

19:48.020 --> 19:49.055
All right. Vocals.

19:49.088 --> 19:50.857
You hear that, Lucious?

19:50.890 --> 19:53.092
I think he might be the one.

19:53.125 --> 19:55.262
I...

19:55.295 --> 19:57.264
I feel so much
when you're singing.

19:57.297 --> 19:59.732
I see visions of...

19:59.766 --> 20:01.901
burnt umber

20:01.934 --> 20:04.371
mixed with a deep magenta,

20:04.404 --> 20:08.241
like hope coupled with
a tremendous amount of fear.

20:10.277 --> 20:11.744
Are you suffering?

20:12.979 --> 20:16.048
Yeah. I am.

20:16.082 --> 20:18.217
My brother, uh--

20:18.251 --> 20:19.919
-he was shot up last week.
-BECKY: Oh.

20:19.952 --> 20:21.854
Sorry to hear that.

20:21.888 --> 20:24.056
Is he gonna be okay?

20:24.090 --> 20:26.593
We actually don't know, so...

20:29.996 --> 20:34.133
-Well, you definitely have
the voice of an Alpha. -Mm-hmm.

20:34.166 --> 20:36.636
But I don't think it's time for
you to be an Alpha right now.

20:36.669 --> 20:39.639
I think it's time for you to go
home and be with your family,

20:39.672 --> 20:42.975
and when everything's okay
there, you come back, and...

20:43.009 --> 20:44.377
I don't know.

20:44.411 --> 20:46.413
...you know, Empire's got you.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.585
Thank you.

20:52.619 --> 20:54.287
So much.

20:54.321 --> 20:56.255
Thank you.

20:56.289 --> 20:58.658
All right.

20:58.691 --> 21:00.760
God bless you.

21:00.793 --> 21:02.495
Um, I think I'll take a break.

21:02.529 --> 21:04.263
-Yeah, five-minute break.
-Yeah.

21:04.297 --> 21:06.333
-That's good.
-(tapping on table)

21:11.838 --> 21:14.240
What was that?

21:14.273 --> 21:17.344
-What? -He brought his pain
in here because that's

21:17.377 --> 21:19.312
what fuels him.

21:19.346 --> 21:21.013
(Lucious sighs)

21:21.047 --> 21:24.784
I came to Empire with you today
to help you heal the pain.

21:24.817 --> 21:28.488
-Oh.
-But you seem to thrive with it.

21:28.521 --> 21:32.091
I've watched you
be needlessly cruel all day.

21:32.124 --> 21:35.495
No, you've watched me
be you, Lucious.

21:35.528 --> 21:38.331
Yeah. See, that's what it takes
to run an empire.

21:38.365 --> 21:39.832
The empire that you built,

21:39.866 --> 21:42.335
the empire
I spent 17 years in prison for.

21:42.369 --> 21:45.705
You know, if you don't think
this is worth fighting for,

21:45.738 --> 21:47.206
why don't you take yourself
home?

21:47.239 --> 21:50.710
I mean, don't-don't be here
to do me no favors, okay?

21:50.743 --> 21:54.547
Hey, the break is over.
We still have a deadline. Next!

22:02.722 --> 22:06.659
* I like your smeared lipstick

22:06.693 --> 22:08.795
* Your eyeliner

22:08.828 --> 22:09.796
BOTH:
* Damn

22:09.829 --> 22:12.365
* You got me addicted

22:12.399 --> 22:15.802
* And I'm a first timer

22:15.835 --> 22:17.570
* You got me good

22:17.604 --> 22:20.840
* Because love

22:20.873 --> 22:22.909
* Is like a drug

22:23.910 --> 22:26.879
* And you

22:28.415 --> 22:30.583
* Must be the plug

22:32.251 --> 22:33.720
* I can't get away

22:33.753 --> 22:35.755
* Want you every day

22:35.788 --> 22:36.989
* When you medicate

22:37.023 --> 22:39.058
* All the pain goes away

22:39.091 --> 22:40.126
* Because love

22:41.928 --> 22:45.598
* Is like a drug

22:45.632 --> 22:47.600
-* Yeah
-* Yeah

22:48.635 --> 22:50.236
* And you must be

22:50.269 --> 22:52.905
* The plug.

22:52.939 --> 22:56.242
These new lyrics
are not there yet.

22:56.275 --> 22:58.377
Everybody
understands substance abuse,

22:58.411 --> 23:00.880
but, you know,
do they understand love

23:00.913 --> 23:02.682
and sex addiction?

23:02.715 --> 23:04.283
What, it's too hard-core?

23:04.316 --> 23:05.685
(scoffs) Please.

23:05.718 --> 23:07.286
When I get around
certain people,

23:07.319 --> 23:08.721
it's like...

23:08.755 --> 23:10.457
it's like I'm getting high.

23:10.490 --> 23:13.426
(chuckles) Like you trying
to get high off of TaKeem?

23:13.460 --> 23:14.561
(laughs)

23:15.462 --> 23:17.029
Well, more her than him.

23:17.063 --> 23:20.600
I don't know, I just get really
overwhelmed by my feelings

23:20.633 --> 23:24.203
and end up acting out
really intensely,

23:24.236 --> 23:26.706
and I think I scare people away.
Then I end up alone.

23:26.739 --> 23:27.940
I'm the exact opposite

23:27.974 --> 23:30.577
'cause that kind of intimacy...

23:30.610 --> 23:32.378
freaks me out.

23:32.411 --> 23:34.246
You seemed pretty intimate
with Warren the other night.

23:34.280 --> 23:35.915
-I know. Right?
-(laughs)

23:35.948 --> 23:37.550
-Yeah.
-I don't know.

23:37.584 --> 23:39.251
I just...
I feel like he's different.

23:39.285 --> 23:43.222
You're the first person
I said this to out loud, but...

23:43.255 --> 23:47.159
I think he could be my one.

23:47.193 --> 23:49.729
-Your one?
-Yeah, maybe.

23:49.762 --> 23:52.264
My dad would say that
about my mom.

23:52.298 --> 23:54.166
"She's my one."

23:54.200 --> 23:56.769
And right before his accident,
I got a glimpse into that,

23:56.803 --> 23:58.838
and it was so...

23:58.871 --> 24:01.373
so pure and so real.

24:03.610 --> 24:06.513
I don't want to settle
for anything less than that.

24:15.688 --> 24:17.857
Hey, Pop.

24:17.890 --> 24:19.626
What are you doing here?

24:19.659 --> 24:21.528
I thought you were helping
Cookie choose the first album.

24:21.561 --> 24:24.096
I think your mother's
had enough of me for the day.

24:24.130 --> 24:26.032
I mean,
she can't see what I hear,

24:26.065 --> 24:28.835
and I can't hear
the things she see.

24:28.868 --> 24:30.703
I just think
it's better I go home.

24:33.540 --> 24:36.442
Crimson.

24:36.475 --> 24:38.144
That's the same sharp,

24:38.177 --> 24:39.946
bleeding pain

24:39.979 --> 24:41.714
that I see in you.

24:41.748 --> 24:44.617
Are you okay?

24:44.651 --> 24:46.519
You seem so different.

24:48.154 --> 24:50.790
(chuckles softly)
Come on, Pop.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.825
I'll walk you out.

24:55.662 --> 24:58.130
-Why those colors?
-I don't know.

24:58.164 --> 25:00.466
Somebody sent them to me.

25:00.499 --> 25:03.369
-Well, get rid of 'em.
-Pop.

25:04.370 --> 25:06.038
Hakeem, I've tried.

25:06.072 --> 25:08.307
There's absolutely no way
that I can get that many berets

25:08.340 --> 25:09.709
in that raspberry color.

25:09.742 --> 25:11.978
It's one for each guest.
We need tambourines.

25:12.011 --> 25:13.646
We need doves. Write that down.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.047
Okay, look, that's enough.

25:15.081 --> 25:16.549
Y'all can figure it out.
It's not that deep.

25:16.583 --> 25:18.885
It's a princess and Prince
birthday party.

25:18.918 --> 25:20.352
May he rest in peace.

25:20.386 --> 25:22.789
(chuckles): And, Anika,
you are here as a courtesy.

25:24.023 --> 25:25.057
So you need to calm down.

25:25.091 --> 25:26.425
ANDRE:
Hey, everybody.

25:26.458 --> 25:28.861
Pop wanted to see his office
before...

25:28.895 --> 25:32.198
-Nobody told me my granddaughter
was here. -HAKEEM: Shh.

25:32.231 --> 25:33.666
She's asleep in her stroller.

25:33.700 --> 25:35.434
Anika is here,

25:35.467 --> 25:37.670
um, because she's planning
her daughter...

25:37.704 --> 25:38.738
(whispering):
your granddaughter's...

25:38.771 --> 25:40.506
-(normal voice): birthday party.
-Anika.

25:40.539 --> 25:41.741
COOKIE:
Yes.

25:41.774 --> 25:43.743
Hi. How are you?

25:43.776 --> 25:47.179
Better now that I'm out of jail.

25:47.213 --> 25:49.716
-She was in prison, too?
-Uh, jail ain't prison,

25:49.749 --> 25:52.084
and she wasn't in there
long enough to break a nail.

25:52.118 --> 25:54.186
Look, Lucious is leaving.
He just came to stop by.

25:54.220 --> 25:56.188
-I wanted to see Bella.
-I'm sorry I did not come

25:56.222 --> 25:57.890
see you in the hospital.
I'm sure you would have come

25:57.924 --> 25:59.592
to see me in jail
if you had been able to.

25:59.626 --> 26:01.393
After all, you are the reason
that I was there.

26:06.398 --> 26:09.268
Listen, I'm...

26:09.301 --> 26:12.204
Anika, I'm sorry
for anything I did wrong to you.

26:12.238 --> 26:14.807
I really am.

26:18.845 --> 26:21.247
A sincere apology?

26:21.280 --> 26:22.314
(chuckling):
Wow.

26:22.348 --> 26:23.482
Lucious, what is this for?

26:23.515 --> 26:24.817
For, uh...

26:24.851 --> 26:26.252
forcing me into a sham marriage?

26:26.285 --> 26:27.887
Or for ripping my child

26:27.920 --> 26:29.121
out of my arms for six months?

26:29.155 --> 26:30.389
Who the hell you think you are

26:30.422 --> 26:31.590
-to judge anybody?
-Andre!

26:31.624 --> 26:32.825
-What, you forgot?
Did you forget? -Andre!

26:32.859 --> 26:34.426
-Do you need me to remind you?
-Calm down!

26:34.460 --> 26:35.427
LUCIOUS:
Orient yourself.

26:35.461 --> 26:36.663
(Bella crying)

26:36.696 --> 26:37.897
-Just breathe.
-Just breathe.

26:37.930 --> 26:38.998
-HAKEEM: Just calm down.
-LUCIOUS: Breathe.

26:39.031 --> 26:41.634
Orient yourself around the room

26:41.668 --> 26:43.235
and find another way to express

26:43.269 --> 26:46.806
-what you're feeling.
-(sighs)

26:46.839 --> 26:48.140
HAKEEM:
Just breathe, Dre.

26:48.174 --> 26:49.842
(inhales deeply)

26:49.876 --> 26:51.477
(exhales)

26:51.510 --> 26:53.846
You're not the only person
in this family

26:53.880 --> 26:55.614
to forget things.

26:57.049 --> 26:59.618
Something else happened
the day Bella was born.

27:03.990 --> 27:07.126
Rhonda.

27:07.159 --> 27:09.962
(whispering):
Oh, I'm so sorry.

27:09.996 --> 27:11.964
Somebody sent me flowers today.

27:11.998 --> 27:13.532
(sighs)

27:13.565 --> 27:16.535
I thought it was one of you,
but...

27:16.568 --> 27:18.137
(exhales)

27:18.170 --> 27:20.139
I should have known better.

27:20.172 --> 27:22.208
I told you my wife died, Pop,

27:22.241 --> 27:25.111
but I didn't tell you how.

27:25.144 --> 27:26.612
Screaming.

27:26.645 --> 27:29.181
Every bone in her body...

27:29.215 --> 27:30.883
broken.

27:32.218 --> 27:34.320
And the last face she saw,

27:34.353 --> 27:35.822
it was...

27:37.423 --> 27:40.192
But because you all felt
that protecting family secrets

27:40.226 --> 27:41.994
was more important
than telling the truth,

27:42.028 --> 27:43.195
she got away with murder.

27:43.229 --> 27:44.897
And now here you are,

27:44.931 --> 27:48.134
planning
her baby's birthday party

27:48.167 --> 27:49.969
while my family,

27:50.002 --> 27:51.537
-my family...
-(screaming)

27:51.570 --> 27:53.672
-rots in the ground!
-Andre! (sighs)

27:53.706 --> 27:57.343
But that's how it goes, Pop.

27:58.577 --> 27:59.912
That's how it always goes
for me.

27:59.946 --> 28:02.148
(Bella crying)

28:02.181 --> 28:04.183
(exhales)

28:14.761 --> 28:16.495
You were right. I was wrong.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.564
Oh.

28:18.597 --> 28:19.932
Is there...

28:19.966 --> 28:23.335
is there something
that-that you need?

28:23.369 --> 28:26.672
Just a big, fat "I told you so."

28:26.705 --> 28:28.007
(chuckles)

28:28.040 --> 28:31.510
Well, he was, um...

28:31.543 --> 28:34.213
disoriented when he got home.

28:34.246 --> 28:36.215
We were gonna do
some somatic work,

28:36.248 --> 28:37.884
but I just put him to bed.

28:37.917 --> 28:41.253
I just wanted Lucious'
first day back to Empire

28:41.287 --> 28:43.589
to be amazing.

28:43.622 --> 28:45.892
Guess he wasn't ready.

28:45.925 --> 28:48.560
I did read the book you gave me.

28:48.594 --> 28:51.463
-Great. -And there's
a section in it about, uh,

28:51.497 --> 28:53.933
identifying, uh, the crossroads?

28:53.966 --> 28:55.601
I'm looking for it with him.

28:55.634 --> 28:57.736
We're using lucid dreaming.

28:57.770 --> 28:59.638
I think I know
Lucious' crossroads.

28:59.671 --> 29:01.707
I've been there.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.075
Seen it.

29:03.109 --> 29:04.476
I'm-I'm thinking
about taking him.

29:04.510 --> 29:06.145
-Like it says in the book...
-Oh, no.

29:06.178 --> 29:07.446
Please, please don't.

29:07.479 --> 29:08.815
Don't take him there.

29:08.848 --> 29:11.150
It's too soon.

29:11.183 --> 29:14.420
Listen, Cookie, this really
could be a critical tool

29:14.453 --> 29:17.656
once his core identity
is more stable.

29:17.689 --> 29:19.358
But in the right time.

29:20.927 --> 29:24.530
Tell me about it.

29:25.597 --> 29:29.101
Well, it's back in Philly.

29:29.135 --> 29:32.104
It's a lion statue in the hood.

29:32.138 --> 29:34.606
And Lucious slept under it

29:34.640 --> 29:36.909
the first night he was homeless.

29:36.943 --> 29:38.845
Back when he was, uh...

29:38.878 --> 29:40.446
Dwight Walker.

29:40.479 --> 29:43.349
He was only nine years old.

29:46.152 --> 29:47.820
Don't you think
it's a little late in the game

29:47.854 --> 29:49.521
for you to be changing
your tracks now, baby?

29:49.555 --> 29:52.091
Yeah, but I can't help that.
I mean, Tory and I

29:52.124 --> 29:53.592
kind of tweaked the lyrics
last night,

29:53.625 --> 29:54.861
but it's still bothering me.

29:54.894 --> 29:57.296
Let me see.

29:58.730 --> 30:01.300
Well, unless you secretly been
into Taylor Swift all this time,

30:01.333 --> 30:02.969
maybe it's the line
about smeared red lips

30:03.002 --> 30:04.036
and smudged eyeliner.

30:04.070 --> 30:05.637
What am I supposed to do?

30:05.671 --> 30:07.673
I'm supposed to sing about
scruffy faces in the morning?

30:07.706 --> 30:08.941
No, I didn't say all of that.

30:08.975 --> 30:10.376
But, you know, I don't know.

30:10.409 --> 30:13.445
True. I mean, honestly, why not?

30:13.479 --> 30:14.847
What?

30:14.881 --> 30:17.649
Well, scruffy faces, no.

30:17.683 --> 30:19.852
But it's been feeling fake,

30:19.886 --> 30:21.954
and if I'm gonna sing
about love,

30:21.988 --> 30:24.023
I should sing
about the way that I love.

30:25.257 --> 30:26.725
Love?

30:26.758 --> 30:28.694
They don't call it
"making like," do they?

30:28.727 --> 30:30.362
(playing piano)

30:39.605 --> 30:41.173
PORSHA: We just heard all
the best Empire has to offer.

30:41.207 --> 30:43.309
-Still not good enough.
-What in the hell is this?

30:43.342 --> 30:45.011
So, what-what-what do we do now?

30:45.044 --> 30:47.379
Well, thank the music gods

30:47.413 --> 30:49.515
Jamal actually agreed
to come in and audition.

30:49.548 --> 30:51.250
And he's doing a duet.

30:51.283 --> 30:53.319
With who?

30:53.352 --> 30:55.254
Oh, no, no.

30:55.287 --> 30:57.856
No, Snow White.
Didn't I tell you no?

30:57.890 --> 30:59.691
Cookie, just listen
to the song, okay?

30:59.725 --> 31:01.193
It'll knock the rocks off
your little collar there.

31:01.227 --> 31:03.262
No! Jamal,

31:03.295 --> 31:04.563
-can you fix this?
-JAMAL: Yo, I-I'm...

31:04.596 --> 31:05.764
I'm sorry for, um, being late.

31:05.797 --> 31:08.500
I was working on the song
all night long.

31:08.534 --> 31:10.669
Tory, I love you, you know I do,

31:10.702 --> 31:12.204
but I had to take you
off the song.

31:12.238 --> 31:13.672
-What? -Yes.
I'm trying to make an album

31:13.705 --> 31:15.541
-full of love songs. I'm sorry.
-What?

31:15.574 --> 31:17.009
-And that can't include me?
-No, it can't.

31:17.043 --> 31:18.710
I'm sorry.

31:18.744 --> 31:21.013
Take your little song.
I don't need you anyway.

31:21.047 --> 31:22.381
I'm done.
You guys are ridiculous.

31:22.414 --> 31:24.250
-This is just absolutely absurd.
-All right, she mad at me...

31:24.283 --> 31:25.517
Bye-bye. Thank you.

31:25.551 --> 31:27.053
(clears throat)

31:27.086 --> 31:29.922
Anyway,
I've got to make music that...

31:29.956 --> 31:31.357
If it's gonna be a love song,

31:31.390 --> 31:32.624
it's got to reflect
the way that I love.

31:32.658 --> 31:34.060
So I'm going to sing a duet,

31:34.093 --> 31:35.227
but it's gonna be with a man.

31:35.261 --> 31:36.895
Warren?

31:36.929 --> 31:37.964
Warren?

31:37.997 --> 31:39.631
Uh-uh. Warren is a lawyer.

31:39.665 --> 31:41.433
He is not an Empire artist.

31:41.467 --> 31:42.734
Becky, chill out, okay?

31:42.768 --> 31:44.370
'Cause, first of all,
you know the boy can sing.

31:44.403 --> 31:46.905
-He's all right. -He's just
gonna demo it for now.

31:46.939 --> 31:48.107
-Just listen.
-COOKIE: Okay, well,

31:48.140 --> 31:49.441
can y'all hurry up?
You're wasting my time.

31:49.475 --> 31:50.609
I'm on deadline.

31:50.642 --> 31:53.312
Don't pay attention to anybody.
Just sing to me.

31:53.345 --> 31:56.115
-Go! -Looking pretty nervous
for a performance. -Come on.

32:02.588 --> 32:03.922
* Oh

32:03.956 --> 32:05.457
-* Ain't nobody
-* No

32:05.491 --> 32:07.259
-* Business
-* Uh-uh

32:07.293 --> 32:09.061
* If I'm hooked on you

32:09.095 --> 32:10.262
* And keep coming back

32:10.296 --> 32:11.263
* Nah

32:11.297 --> 32:12.898
* No nicotine

32:12.931 --> 32:14.967
* In cigarettes

32:15.001 --> 32:16.635
-* Ain't got nothin' on you
-* Nothin' on you

32:16.668 --> 32:18.237
* You help me relax

32:18.270 --> 32:20.839
* It's unbelievable

32:20.872 --> 32:22.074
It's cute.

32:22.108 --> 32:24.143
* How good you make me feel

32:24.176 --> 32:25.444
* Damn

32:25.477 --> 32:29.181
* You should be illegal

32:29.215 --> 32:30.816
* Baby, my lips are sealed

32:30.849 --> 32:31.917
* I know it's real

32:31.950 --> 32:32.951
* I know the deal

32:32.985 --> 32:36.288
* 'Cause love

32:36.322 --> 32:38.224
* Is like a drug

32:40.726 --> 32:43.362
* And you

32:43.395 --> 32:44.696
* Must be the plug

32:47.666 --> 32:49.535
* I can't get away

32:49.568 --> 32:51.370
* Want you every day

32:51.403 --> 32:52.538
* When you medicate

32:52.571 --> 32:53.839
* All the pain

32:53.872 --> 32:55.541
* Goes away

32:55.574 --> 32:58.277
* Because love

32:58.310 --> 33:00.812
-* Is like a drug
-Yeah, you better sing.

33:00.846 --> 33:02.348
They better sing.

33:02.381 --> 33:04.316
-* Yeah
-(whoops)

33:04.350 --> 33:06.185
* And you must be

33:06.218 --> 33:08.054
* The plug

33:08.087 --> 33:11.057
* Oh, yeah.

33:11.090 --> 33:13.392
(cheering)

33:13.425 --> 33:15.061
COOKIE:
Yes! Okay...

33:15.094 --> 33:16.162
-That was really good.
-Okay.

33:16.195 --> 33:17.963
-I like that.
-All right. All right.

33:17.996 --> 33:21.133
(clears throat)
That was amazing.

33:21.167 --> 33:23.502
It was beautiful, it was real,
it was from the heart.

33:23.535 --> 33:25.237
PORSHA:
We got our Alpha.

33:28.607 --> 33:31.043
WOMAN:
Happy birthday, Bella!

33:31.077 --> 33:33.512
-Hakeem, yeah!
-(applause and cheering)

33:33.545 --> 33:35.013
Make some noise!

33:37.583 --> 33:40.552
-(whooping, whistling,
cheering, applause) -Welcome.

33:40.586 --> 33:43.089
Welcome. Welcome. Welcome.
Listen, I want to thank y'all

33:43.122 --> 33:47.359
for coming out to celebrate my
princess's first birthday party.

33:47.393 --> 33:49.928
Bella Lyon!

33:49.961 --> 33:51.863
(applause and cheering)

33:54.900 --> 33:56.335
This for you, baby.

33:56.368 --> 33:58.537
-Let's hit it.
-Yay.

33:58.570 --> 34:00.906
(synthesizer plays intro
to "Let's Go Crazy")

34:02.974 --> 34:05.711
-HAKEEM: Dearly beloved...
-(applause and cheering)

34:05.744 --> 34:09.248
We're gathered here today to get
through this thing called life.

34:11.083 --> 34:13.219
Electric word, life.

34:13.252 --> 34:14.753
It means forever, and that's

34:14.786 --> 34:17.723
a mighty long time,
but I'm here to tell you

34:17.756 --> 34:20.126
there's something else.

34:20.159 --> 34:22.461
The afterworld.

34:22.494 --> 34:25.531
A world
of never-ending happiness.

34:25.564 --> 34:27.566
You can always see the sun,

34:27.599 --> 34:30.636
day or night.

34:30.669 --> 34:32.704
(applause and cheering)

34:32.738 --> 34:35.040
So when you call up that shrink
in Beverly Hills--

34:35.073 --> 34:37.809
you know the one--
Dr. Everything'll Be All Right--

34:37.843 --> 34:40.146
instead of asking him
how much of your time is left,

34:40.179 --> 34:43.149
ask him how much of your mind,
baby.

34:43.182 --> 34:45.151
'Cause in this life,
things are much harder

34:45.184 --> 34:46.752
than in the afterworld...

34:46.785 --> 34:50.656
Now, y'all know, uh, Prince
don't celebrate no birthdays?

34:50.689 --> 34:53.325
-Ain't that right, Tyka?
-See? That's what I said.

34:53.359 --> 34:56.428
That's exactly what I told him,
but what do I know?

34:56.462 --> 34:58.063
I'm nothing more
than a guest here.

34:58.096 --> 34:59.298
* Go crazy

34:59.331 --> 35:02.100
* Punch a higher floor

35:02.134 --> 35:05.271
(whoops)

35:10.442 --> 35:15.181
* If you don't like
the world you're living in *

35:15.214 --> 35:17.449
* Take a look around

35:17.483 --> 35:20.118
* At least you got friends

35:20.152 --> 35:22.588
* So, called my old lady

35:22.621 --> 35:25.123
* For a friendly word

35:25.157 --> 35:27.693
* She picked up the phone,
dropped it on the floor *

35:27.726 --> 35:30.429
* "Ah, ah" was all I heard

35:30.462 --> 35:33.299
* I'm not gonna let the elevator
bring us down *

35:33.332 --> 35:35.201
* Oh, no, let's go

35:35.234 --> 35:37.436
* Let's go crazy

35:37.469 --> 35:40.005
* Let's get nuts

35:40.038 --> 35:41.940
* Let's look
for the purple banana *

35:41.973 --> 35:43.675
* Till they put us
in the truck *

35:43.709 --> 35:45.143
* Let's go

35:49.848 --> 35:52.150
* We're all excited

35:52.184 --> 35:54.553
* But we don't know why

35:54.586 --> 35:57.189
* Maybe it's 'cause

35:57.223 --> 35:59.358
* We're all gonna die

35:59.391 --> 36:01.960
-* And when we do
-* When we do

36:01.993 --> 36:04.230
-* What's it all for?
-* What's it all for?

36:04.263 --> 36:06.498
* Better live now
before the grim reaper *

36:06.532 --> 36:10.502
* Come knocking on your door,
tell me, baby *

36:10.536 --> 36:13.038
* I'm not gonna let
the elevator bring us down *

36:13.071 --> 36:14.706
* Oh, no, let's go

36:14.740 --> 36:18.043
* Crazy

36:18.076 --> 36:20.011
-* Say let's go crazy
-* Go crazy

36:20.045 --> 36:22.681
-* Let's go
-* Let's go

36:22.714 --> 36:24.149
-* Let's go, let's go
-* Let's go

36:24.182 --> 36:25.851
* Dr. Everything'll Be
All Right *

36:25.884 --> 36:28.654
* Will make everything
go wrong *

36:28.687 --> 36:31.523
* Pills and thrills
and daffodils *

36:31.557 --> 36:36.194
* Will kill,
hang tough, children *

36:36.228 --> 36:39.798
* He's comin', he's comin'

36:41.066 --> 36:43.269
* He's comin'

36:43.302 --> 36:45.804
(high-pitched):
* He's comin'!

36:51.543 --> 36:54.313
(applause and cheering)

36:57.416 --> 37:00.386
(guitar solo)

37:03.989 --> 37:07.225
Yeah!
Happy birthday, Bella.

37:21.106 --> 37:23.675
(song ends)

37:33.685 --> 37:35.354
(grunting)

37:36.488 --> 37:37.923
(gunshot)

37:40.292 --> 37:42.794
Hey.

37:42.828 --> 37:44.763
I thought you were supposed
to be getting ready

37:44.796 --> 37:46.565
for Bella's party.

37:46.598 --> 37:50.302
That man that Cookie
wants me to be--

37:50.336 --> 37:54.005
he keeps trying to come back
in my head. Uh...

37:54.039 --> 37:56.141
I don't want to be him.

37:56.174 --> 37:58.410
He's not a good person.
I don't like him.

37:58.444 --> 38:02.080
Dwight?

38:02.113 --> 38:05.417
Hey, just because you know him

38:05.451 --> 38:08.587
doesn't mean
you have to become him.

38:08.620 --> 38:10.622
This is a really
important moment.

38:10.656 --> 38:12.824
You're at a crossroads.

38:12.858 --> 38:15.661
Let me help you choose
a different path.

38:17.663 --> 38:20.031
Come with me.

38:24.803 --> 38:27.939
* It's your birthday, your
birthday, your birthday... *

38:27.973 --> 38:29.875
-This is amazing. Oh, I'm sorry.
I got to go -I thought you...

38:29.908 --> 38:31.610
-say something.
-* Your birthday

38:31.643 --> 38:33.712
* Your birth, it's your
birthday, your birthday... *

38:33.745 --> 38:35.881
I'm so sorry that we forgot

38:35.914 --> 38:38.316
how sad this day was for you,
for all of us.

38:38.350 --> 38:39.951
It's not Bella's fault.

38:39.985 --> 38:42.320
This family needs to find light
where it can, so...

38:42.354 --> 38:44.956
Yeah.

38:44.990 --> 38:48.394
Dre, look,
you know we love you, right?

38:48.427 --> 38:51.129
We're not a family
without you.

38:51.162 --> 38:52.498
We need you.

38:52.531 --> 38:55.667
Maybe Pop was onto something

38:55.701 --> 38:57.836
with this whole, you know,
kumbaya business.

38:57.869 --> 38:59.471
Yeah, he was.
You know what?

38:59.505 --> 39:01.873
I owe him an apology.
Where is he?

39:01.907 --> 39:03.509
I don't know,
I haven't seen him.

39:03.542 --> 39:05.310
Okay, glad to see you, though.

39:05.343 --> 39:08.514
-Okay. Porsha?
-* Better recognize.

39:08.547 --> 39:10.749
-For you, ma'am.
-Thank you, James.

39:10.782 --> 39:12.150
You're welcome.

39:12.183 --> 39:15.487
Hmm. I cannot wait
to see what is happening

39:15.521 --> 39:17.222
in the Metro Observer.

39:17.255 --> 39:19.558
Ooh!

39:19.591 --> 39:21.159
-Wow.
-Huh.

39:21.192 --> 39:22.728
They work fast.

39:22.761 --> 39:24.896
Well, they owe me more favors
than I can count.

39:24.930 --> 39:26.998
Enjoy the sneak preview.

39:27.032 --> 39:30.301
The final edition
will be lethal.

39:47.886 --> 39:51.056
If you're here to arrest me,
you could at least do it

39:51.089 --> 39:54.526
in some place other
than my niece's birthday party.

39:54.560 --> 39:57.896
I was looking at your files.

39:57.929 --> 40:00.098
I saw that today is the day
your wife...

40:02.768 --> 40:05.537
I've already been
incredibly unprofessional,

40:05.571 --> 40:08.239
and I'm probably an idiot
for it,

40:08.273 --> 40:10.809
but I thought
you might be in for a tough day.

40:10.842 --> 40:13.111
You sent the flowers.

40:13.144 --> 40:16.147
CHICKEN:
What's up, Dre?

40:16.181 --> 40:19.485
-What's up?
-(chuckles) Okay.

40:19.518 --> 40:22.621
Let's get the hell out of here.

40:28.159 --> 40:29.661
-Oh, man, that's shady.
-COOKIE: Wait a minute.

40:29.695 --> 40:31.797
-What?
-What are you doing?

40:31.830 --> 40:33.832
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Before we open up any gifts,

40:33.865 --> 40:36.401
where is Anika? We-we can't
open up gifts until her...

40:36.434 --> 40:38.670
Mom, we don't need Anika
to open gifts up.

40:38.704 --> 40:40.338
I don't know, y'all.
All these gifts, I swear.

40:40.371 --> 40:42.007
North West and them,
they about to call us gauche.

40:42.040 --> 40:44.743
COOKIE: No. Shut up. North West
ain't got nothing on Bella Lyon.

40:44.776 --> 40:46.745
Bella, look.
(whoops)

40:46.778 --> 40:48.614
Bella, boo. There you are.

40:48.647 --> 40:52.484
Happy birthday, Bella.

40:52.518 --> 40:54.185
Can't believe
it's already been a year.

40:54.219 --> 40:57.322
-Uh, what the hell are you
doing here? -I invited him.

40:57.355 --> 40:59.324
Oh. So I see you still like
my sloppy seconds.

40:59.357 --> 41:01.693
(scoffs):
Oh, Cookie.

41:01.727 --> 41:03.194
Though Anika may be more
my taste

41:03.228 --> 41:05.864
-than your ghetto ass
ever was, she... -Ha.

41:05.897 --> 41:07.666
-No, what you come up in here
with this? -No, no, sit down.

41:07.699 --> 41:10.268
-He ain't worth it. -We didn't
come here as a couple.

41:10.301 --> 41:12.470
I came with a gift,
though not for Bella.

41:12.504 --> 41:16.341
This gift is for...
the baby's father.

41:16.374 --> 41:20.345
So this is how you treat us
after we include you?

41:20.378 --> 41:22.180
Thank you for including me

41:22.213 --> 41:24.650
in my own daughter's
birthday party, Cookie.

41:24.683 --> 41:26.351
But if there's anything
that I've learned

41:26.384 --> 41:28.453
in the last few years,
very personally,

41:28.486 --> 41:30.822
is that the Lyons
will destroy everything

41:30.856 --> 41:32.558
-that they put their hands on.
-Mm.

41:32.591 --> 41:36.962
Therefore, I will not allow you
to destroy my daughter.

41:36.995 --> 41:40.198
Angelo is here
as my attorney.

41:40.231 --> 41:43.134
I am suing for sole custody
of Bella.

41:43.168 --> 41:46.738
-Ugh.
-(Bella crying)

41:48.874 --> 41:50.842
Here are our demands.

41:50.876 --> 41:52.243
Happy reading.

41:52.277 --> 41:54.746
Happy birthday.

41:59.851 --> 42:01.887
(indistinct conversations)

42:12.964 --> 42:15.066
Where... where are we?

42:15.100 --> 42:17.603
This is the crossroads
where little Dwight Walker

42:17.636 --> 42:20.271
became Lucious Lyon.

42:37.656 --> 42:40.959
Do you see him there?

42:44.763 --> 42:47.298
He looks so sad and alone.

42:47.332 --> 42:49.434
I understand.
I know what that feels like.

42:52.904 --> 42:55.874
To be sad and alone.

42:55.907 --> 42:59.244
But he doesn't ever have
to be alone again.

42:59.277 --> 43:01.813
If you want to change that,

43:01.847 --> 43:04.282
you can choose a different path
right now.

43:04.315 --> 43:06.952
It's up to you.

43:06.985 --> 43:09.087
Would you come with me?

43:09.120 --> 43:12.357
Yes, if you want me to.

43:48.026 --> 43:49.160
Yeah.

43:49.194 --> 43:51.162
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

43:53.464 --> 43:54.800
* Uh *

43:54.833 --> 43:56.334
I guess I used to
be a scary person.

43:56.367 --> 43:58.269
* Whoo *

43:58.303 --> 44:01.206
You hurry up and fix my man,
or we gonna have a problem.

44:01.239 --> 44:05.043
They're gonna turn me
into a monster.

44:05.076 --> 44:08.379
You and me,
Cookie and Lucious forever.

44:08.413 --> 44:12.884
He doesn't even know his name.
He treats his nurse like family
and his family like strangers.

44:12.918 --> 44:14.652
We get knocked down,
we get back up.

44:16.354 --> 44:17.723
Let the games begin.

44:17.756 --> 44:20.726
ANNOUNCER:
Empire. Wednesdays on Fox.

44:20.759 --> 44:23.328
* Say it like
You really mean it *
