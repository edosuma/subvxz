WEBVTT

04:02.377 --> 04:03.968
Well...

04:04.178 --> 04:05.871
<i>terra ferma.</i>

04:14.247 --> 04:17.111
We must be the first tourists
since the war.

04:17.314 --> 04:21.303
- We're not tourists. We're travelers.
- What's the difference?

04:21.915 --> 04:26.143
A tourist thinks about going home
the moment they arrive, Tunner.

04:26.316 --> 04:29.647
Whereas a traveler might not
come back at all.

04:30.317 --> 04:32.909
You mean, I'm a tourist?

04:33.151 --> 04:34.549
Yes, Tunner.

04:34.751 --> 04:37.115
And I'm half and half.

05:26.228 --> 05:29.661
12, 13, 14...

05:39.332 --> 05:41.491
No profession?

05:41.732 --> 05:43.994
Not that I'm aware of.

05:46.967 --> 05:51.991
Madame is a writer.
Monsieur Tunner is a businessman.

05:54.234 --> 05:57.667
My wife wrote one play, monsieur,
five years ago.

05:58.269 --> 06:01.861
I thought it was wonderful,
but the reviews were guarded.

06:02.103 --> 06:05.729
Mr. Tunner's only business
is giving dinner parties.

06:06.670 --> 06:08.000
One at a time.

06:08.638 --> 06:13.697
Monsieur, my husband's a composer.
He chooses to be modest today.

06:15.073 --> 06:16.004
An artist.

06:19.306 --> 06:21.102
How long will you be staying?

06:21.840 --> 06:24.636
Mr. Tunner will stay
three to four weeks...

06:24.841 --> 06:28.399
but my wife and I will stay on
for a year or two.

06:28.675 --> 06:30.141
A year or two?

06:32.242 --> 06:33.868
In this place?

06:37.777 --> 06:39.242
That's it!

07:21.252 --> 07:24.549
The Italians have agreed
to give women the vote.

07:27.188 --> 07:31.587
We can take the train to Boussif.
From there we have to take buses.

07:31.788 --> 07:35.414
You've been to North Africa.
Kit and I will just follow.

07:35.622 --> 07:39.248
- My only plan is, I have no plan.
- Right.

07:39.457 --> 07:40.787
Whatever you say.

08:04.262 --> 08:06.524
<i>Because neither Kit nor Port...</i>

08:06.730 --> 08:10.493
<i>had ever lived a life of any kind
of regularity...</i>

08:10.696 --> 08:16.187
<i>they had made the fatal error of
coming to regard time as nonexistent.</i>

08:16.431 --> 08:21.160
<i>One year was like another.
Eventually, everything would happen.</i>

08:36.836 --> 08:39.597
I had a strange dream last night.

08:39.803 --> 08:43.201
Port, please. Other people's dreams
are so dull.

08:43.404 --> 08:47.860
I know it's boring, but I'll forget it
if I don't tell it. I was...

08:48.071 --> 08:52.731
traveling on a train
which I realized was going to crash...

08:52.939 --> 08:55.031
into a mountain made of sheets.

08:55.239 --> 08:58.764
<i>Consult Madame La Hueff's
Dream Dictionary.</i>

09:00.108 --> 09:01.539
Shut up.

09:02.608 --> 09:05.802
I knew it was going to crash, but...
What?

09:06.009 --> 09:08.976
Why do you go on
when you know it's boring?

09:09.242 --> 09:12.334
Maybe Tunner would like to hear it.
Would you?

09:12.543 --> 09:14.236
Dreams are my cup of tea.

09:14.443 --> 09:15.466
At some point...

09:16.211 --> 09:21.940
I felt I could stop the crash if
I could only open my mouth and scream.

09:24.846 --> 09:29.745
And then I realized it was too late
because I had reached up...

09:29.980 --> 09:33.378
and broken off my teeth
with my hand...

09:33.614 --> 09:36.376
as if they were made of plaster.

09:37.148 --> 09:39.671
I started to sob.

09:40.216 --> 09:44.081
Those kind of terrible dream sobs...

09:44.283 --> 09:47.306
that shake you like an earthquake.

09:55.619 --> 09:57.448
It's all right. Leave her.

09:57.686 --> 09:59.585
Is she crying?

09:59.787 --> 10:05.448
Kit has days when everything in the
world is a sign for something else.

10:06.454 --> 10:10.285
A white Mercedes can't just
simply be a white Mercedes.

10:10.689 --> 10:14.315
It must have a secret meaning
about the whole of life.

10:14.523 --> 10:19.013
Everything is an omen.
Nothing can just be what it is.

10:25.525 --> 10:30.289
I got them from the bellboy. He said
they belonged to General Montgomery.

10:30.493 --> 10:32.982
I thought they might be Monty's.

10:34.360 --> 10:35.883
Excuse me.

10:36.261 --> 10:39.591
Are you staying at the Grand Hotel
by any chance?

10:40.429 --> 10:41.360
Yes.

10:41.795 --> 10:44.785
Oh, good. I'm Eric Lyle. Hello.

10:46.663 --> 10:50.720
I don't suppose you could lend me
20 centimes, could you?

10:50.930 --> 10:54.022
I haven't enough change for a sherry.

11:03.767 --> 11:06.700
- Thanks awfully.
- Eric!

11:06.868 --> 11:09.061
You filthy toad!

11:09.402 --> 11:11.766
What are you concocting?

11:12.002 --> 11:14.628
Hello. I was
just going to buy cigarettes.

11:14.869 --> 11:19.269
You wretched little liar!
You are imbibing!

11:19.470 --> 11:21.459
You know what the doctor said.

11:36.640 --> 11:38.573
- What, sweetie?
- Nothing.

11:40.741 --> 11:44.230
Why did you tell your dream
in front of Tunner?

11:44.475 --> 11:48.841
I was telling it to him.
As much as I told it to you.

11:49.243 --> 11:52.699
I realize you think dreams are boring,
but good God!

11:52.943 --> 11:56.240
Why do you have to take everything
so seriously?

11:56.445 --> 12:00.639
- What is a dream?
- It's just that I don't trust Tunner.

12:00.845 --> 12:03.141
- He's such a gossip.
- Tunner?

12:03.413 --> 12:05.936
Who might he be gossiping to here?

12:06.480 --> 12:10.413
Port, you seem to forget
we'll be back in New York someday.

12:10.615 --> 12:12.012
We may, someday.

12:12.214 --> 12:15.942
I don't care if he tells it
to the whole Eastern seaboard.

12:16.182 --> 12:18.115
Who gives a damn?

12:18.883 --> 12:21.941
And what do you mean,
you don't trust Tunner?

12:22.183 --> 12:24.116
I never felt at ease with him.

12:24.551 --> 12:28.245
You might have said that
before we crossed the Atlantic.

12:28.452 --> 12:30.850
- You invited him.
- He invited himself.

12:31.419 --> 12:34.943
We let him come.
You let him come.

12:35.353 --> 12:36.944
Don't misunderstand me.

12:37.287 --> 12:41.185
He's tall, he's very rich,
he's handsome...

12:41.387 --> 12:43.751
I like him very much.

12:45.789 --> 12:48.278
What does it mean,
you don't trust him?

12:48.489 --> 12:52.922
- That must mean something.
- Of course I mean something.

12:53.123 --> 12:55.817
It's just not important.

13:01.958 --> 13:04.550
I'm going for a walk. Want to come?

13:04.759 --> 13:06.123
No, thanks.

13:06.326 --> 13:10.054
I'm really enjoying this room
after all that sea.

13:10.261 --> 13:15.160
- I'm going for a walk. Want to come?
- No, thanks.

13:15.362 --> 13:19.590
I'm really enjoying this room
after all that sea.

13:19.762 --> 13:22.422
- I'm going for a walk...
- No, thanks.

13:23.296 --> 13:25.229
What do you want to do?

13:26.364 --> 13:29.297
Isn't it time for you to rub my tummy?

13:42.934 --> 13:45.093
I know what you're thinking.

13:55.070 --> 13:59.197
That's a nice scent. What do you mean
about not trusting Tunner?

13:59.438 --> 14:02.166
Let's just not talk about it.

14:02.871 --> 14:04.996
Okay, baby.

14:13.541 --> 14:17.769
Anyway, Tunner is much more
your business than he is mine.

16:53.808 --> 16:55.535
Nothing.

17:00.576 --> 17:03.008
My name is Smail.

17:03.210 --> 17:06.733
I was in the 5th Battalion
of sharpshooters.

17:12.744 --> 17:13.904
Look.

17:20.713 --> 17:25.806
I fought the war. Much people died.
Nothing to eat, that's all.

17:26.381 --> 17:29.212
- You are sad.
- No, I'm tired.

17:29.416 --> 17:34.747
You live a short time.
Have fun.

17:36.183 --> 17:37.945
Yes, I know.

17:39.884 --> 17:43.510
I will take you to a friend of mine.
A girl.

17:43.718 --> 17:45.309
Beautiful.

17:45.486 --> 17:48.543
More than the moon.

17:48.752 --> 17:51.981
- You mean a whore.
- A whore?

18:24.727 --> 18:26.057
Come, monsieur, come.

18:26.261 --> 18:28.193
See for yourself.

18:30.561 --> 18:32.528
Monsieur, listen.

18:32.762 --> 18:34.160
Hey!

18:35.996 --> 18:39.326
It is very late. Where are we going?

18:39.530 --> 18:41.520
Down here. That's her tent.

18:41.731 --> 18:43.959
Come, monsieur, come.

19:34.108 --> 19:38.098
- Why don't you take off your shoes?
- No, thank you.

19:39.877 --> 19:44.367
You pay her because you take up
her time. That's all.

19:44.577 --> 19:46.510
Why are you whispering?

19:47.044 --> 19:50.568
Because of the men in the other tents.

19:55.447 --> 19:57.970
Her name is Mahrnia.

24:28.837 --> 24:30.804
Stop it! Stop it!

24:33.339 --> 24:34.805
God!

24:37.207 --> 24:40.071
- Who is it?
- Me.

24:40.340 --> 24:42.398
Are you awake?

24:42.607 --> 24:43.574
Not very.

24:44.441 --> 24:47.601
It's the best time of the day.
You shouldn't miss it.

24:50.209 --> 24:52.608
I'll be there in a minute, Tunner.

25:51.522 --> 25:53.148
You all right?

25:53.423 --> 25:54.787
Yeah.

25:57.023 --> 25:58.546
Hi.

26:00.524 --> 26:03.355
- Hi.
- Hello, Tunner.

26:04.325 --> 26:06.757
Are you holding a seance in here?

26:16.194 --> 26:18.456
You're in a disgustingly good mood.

26:18.895 --> 26:20.588
I'm looking at you.

26:21.928 --> 26:24.360
Where was Port?
I waited up for him.

26:24.696 --> 26:29.096
- You waited up for him?
- We had sort of a date at the cafe.

26:29.296 --> 26:33.389
Then I read in bed until late.
He hadn't come in by 4:00.

26:33.598 --> 26:36.429
Then he didn't sleep much.
He's gone out.

26:36.665 --> 26:42.690
<i>- You mean he hasn't come in yet.
- Will you order some petit dejeuner?</i>

26:42.866 --> 26:47.231
I'd like some of their awful coffee
and plaster croissants.

26:53.868 --> 26:55.334
Hello?

27:04.071 --> 27:08.471
You're a very curious person.
It's hard to understand you.

27:08.705 --> 27:13.968
Tunner, stop trying to be interesting.
On you, it looks terrible.

27:14.139 --> 27:16.264
You're too good-Iooking.

27:19.674 --> 27:21.299
Are you ready?

27:22.508 --> 27:24.804
- I'm taking you shopping.
- Are you?

27:25.009 --> 27:27.567
Yes, before it gets too hot.

27:28.076 --> 27:31.271
Didn't you say you wanted to buy
a mosquito net?

27:31.476 --> 27:34.204
That was yesterday.
I'm exhausted today.

27:34.410 --> 27:36.501
I don't know what I want.

27:36.711 --> 27:37.678
You dress.

27:38.712 --> 27:40.735
I'll wait in Port's room.

27:41.979 --> 27:44.003
I'll even shut the door.

27:53.514 --> 27:56.743
Do you and Port ever share
the same room?

27:56.948 --> 28:01.041
When you travel for months on end,
you have to set it up this way.

28:01.250 --> 28:05.774
And the first rule of marriage is,
never confuse sex with sleep.

28:05.984 --> 28:08.644
Besides, Port usually works at night.

28:08.851 --> 28:12.614
You mean he snores. Or you do.

28:15.186 --> 28:16.812
Bore, bore, bore.

28:26.722 --> 28:28.154
May I come in?

28:28.556 --> 28:29.987
Well, of course.

28:34.690 --> 28:37.088
What happened to you?

28:43.559 --> 28:45.081
- Port...
- What is that?

28:45.292 --> 28:47.952
- It's Tunner.
- What's he doing in my room?

28:48.159 --> 28:51.785
You know what, Kit?
I've decided that you need me.

28:51.960 --> 28:55.052
He was just waiting for me
while I got dressed.

28:55.261 --> 28:58.319
- Stop it. Stop it.
- Go ahead and finish.

29:01.329 --> 29:02.317
Well, well.

29:03.496 --> 29:07.395
- What the hell is all this mess?
- Back from the wars, eh?

29:07.631 --> 29:09.460
And do you look it.

29:10.164 --> 29:13.892
Kit and I were just going for a walk.

29:14.099 --> 29:16.793
God, man, have you seen yourself?

29:19.866 --> 29:25.323
Yes, I need some coffee. Would you two
get out of here and go on your walk?

29:25.501 --> 29:28.399
See you later, old man.
Get some sleep.

29:34.570 --> 29:38.333
Feel quite wretched today.

29:38.637 --> 29:41.900
I suspect the malaria is coming back.

29:48.939 --> 29:52.202
He looks just like
that young murderer...

29:52.439 --> 29:55.964
that went about slicing up little
children. Remember?

29:56.207 --> 30:00.971
I think the murderer, his appearance,
is more wholesome.

30:01.742 --> 30:05.732
- What revolting water.
- Then don't drink it, you sissy.

30:05.976 --> 30:10.341
I'm so tired of all your talk
about dirt and worms. Don't drink it!

30:11.777 --> 30:13.368
Nobody cares either way.

30:13.578 --> 30:15.976
They are both monsters.

30:16.212 --> 30:18.804
She's a travel writer. Guidebooks.

30:19.046 --> 30:24.002
But they own that Mercedes. And they
do happen to be driving to Boussif.

30:24.346 --> 30:26.176
Oh, God! How awful!

30:26.414 --> 30:32.473
We'll have to choose between tortures:
taking the train or driving with them.

30:33.515 --> 30:37.778
I wouldn't suffer over the choice
before they give it to you.

30:38.017 --> 30:42.313
- Great! Another omen.
- Oh, not again.

30:42.550 --> 30:43.777
Useless.

30:52.085 --> 30:55.018
Yes, please, I would like...

30:55.253 --> 31:00.243
yeah, kebab with some...

31:00.987 --> 31:06.546
What was all that about with Tunner?
It looked as if he'd slept in my room.

31:07.023 --> 31:11.752
I didn't want Tunner to know
that you hadn't been back last night.

31:12.024 --> 31:15.149
- Is that objectionable?
- No, it's considerate.

31:15.391 --> 31:18.017
Except you haven't said
why he was there.

31:18.558 --> 31:20.990
You haven't said
what you did last night.

31:21.192 --> 31:23.885
And you haven't asked me.

31:24.126 --> 31:26.524
And I'm not going to.

31:27.860 --> 31:33.192
I'm sure they're going to ask us.
And I'm terrified of trains.

31:33.428 --> 31:35.019
I hate choices.

31:36.662 --> 31:40.823
<i>Rather than try to ease whatever
tension might rise between them...</i>

31:41.063 --> 31:43.962
<i>she determined
to be intransigent.</i>

31:44.196 --> 31:48.027
<i>It could come now or later,
that much- awaited reunion...</i>

31:48.264 --> 31:51.459
<i>but it must be all his doing.</i>

32:24.306 --> 32:27.466
You were right. The young monster
woke me up.

32:27.706 --> 32:31.230
He says they're leaving
in about an hour to Boussif.

32:31.440 --> 32:36.305
And joy of joys,
they've asked us to join them.

32:36.708 --> 32:39.197
I knew it.

32:39.976 --> 32:44.375
It's much faster by car.
Probably 5 hours instead of 11.

32:44.576 --> 32:49.441
Probably a lot safer too.
Certainly a lot more comfortable.

32:49.678 --> 32:52.304
The trains are hellish.

32:54.779 --> 33:00.406
- Why is it so dark out?
- It's not dark. It's beautiful.

33:01.380 --> 33:04.437
There is one slight problem.

33:05.480 --> 33:08.470
They can't take all three of us.

33:10.215 --> 33:15.114
Well, that settles it then.
We can't leave Tunner.

33:15.649 --> 33:21.709
What do you mean? He's not our guest.
We don't have to be with him, do we?

33:21.918 --> 33:24.248
You don't have to, no.

33:24.518 --> 33:26.678
You mean, you do?

33:27.585 --> 33:30.847
I'm not leaving Tunner
to go off in that Nazi car...

33:31.086 --> 33:33.575
with that redhead
and that criminal.

33:33.820 --> 33:37.810
- Little criminal?
- He gives me the creeps.

33:42.455 --> 33:45.820
But you can do exactly as you like.

33:49.223 --> 33:52.190
I'm going on the train with Tunner.

33:52.391 --> 33:56.687
Kit, you're terrified of trains.

33:57.225 --> 33:58.691
Yes.

34:00.225 --> 34:02.987
But now I've made my mind up.

34:04.427 --> 34:06.450
To go with Tunner?

34:06.694 --> 34:07.990
Yes.

34:20.797 --> 34:22.989
Can you read in this light?

34:23.230 --> 34:26.094
I'm just looking at the pictures.

34:31.065 --> 34:36.022
I'm sorry. It's just that I get
very nervous on trains.

34:36.534 --> 34:38.193
Now, listen...

34:38.667 --> 34:41.634
I want you to forget about
all that stuff.

34:43.668 --> 34:47.328
I am here to make sure
nothing happens to you.

35:02.772 --> 35:07.364
They search our rooms, they steal
our things and they eavesdrop.

35:07.606 --> 35:09.470
I'm sorry. Who does all this?

35:09.674 --> 35:14.403
The Arabs! They are a stinking
low race with nothing to do but spy.

35:14.642 --> 35:19.507
They hate us all. So do the French.
They loathe us most.

35:19.743 --> 35:24.369
- I find Arabs very sympathetic.
- That's because they're servile.

35:24.610 --> 35:27.804
- Once you turn your back...
- Once, in Mogadore...

35:28.011 --> 35:31.342
Shut up! Who wants to hear
about your stupidity?

35:31.511 --> 35:34.307
- Mother!
- How dare you speak to me like that?

35:34.512 --> 35:38.206
You need a good smack on the face,
that's what you need.

35:48.248 --> 35:51.044
How about some medicine
for the nerves?

35:51.683 --> 35:53.546
Not champagne?

35:53.783 --> 35:57.147
Oh, Tunner. Tunner!

35:57.617 --> 36:01.744
- Just what the doctor ordered.
- We're saved.

36:01.952 --> 36:05.612
- Port would have a fit.
- Yeah, well, Port isn't here.

36:05.785 --> 36:08.014
Oh, look! A burro!

36:08.220 --> 36:11.653
It reminds me of Spain.
That's a horrible country.

36:11.854 --> 36:15.218
- Full of soldiers, priests and Jews.
- Jews?

36:15.421 --> 36:17.910
They run the country, of course.

36:18.155 --> 36:22.248
<i>Only in Spain they call themselves,
"Catolico, Catolico!"</i>

36:29.524 --> 36:31.922
- No, we must make it last.
- Why?

36:32.158 --> 36:36.057
Because it's magic.
It can stop a train.

36:36.525 --> 36:39.185
Well, I've got lots of magic.

36:56.130 --> 36:58.460
Is that a man singing?

36:58.864 --> 37:00.693
Hard to tell.

37:01.465 --> 37:03.294
Drink up.

37:10.133 --> 37:14.260
- I think I was never meant to live.
- Now, Kit...

37:14.433 --> 37:17.093
You're nervous.
It's why I got champagne.

37:17.334 --> 37:21.165
Nothing's that important, you know?
Relax, take it easy.

37:21.402 --> 37:24.335
- Who was it said...?
- No, Tunner!

37:26.236 --> 37:29.328
No. Champagne, yes. Philosophy, no.

37:45.607 --> 37:48.732
Gracious! Aren't we picturesque?

37:49.907 --> 37:54.398
Yes, well, your presence
completes the portrait.

37:55.175 --> 37:59.575
- Has your lovely wife arrived safely?
- Yes. She came in last night.

37:59.810 --> 38:03.504
- But I haven't seen her. She's asleep.
- Of course.

38:10.179 --> 38:14.236
We're off to Ain Krorfa tomorrow,
poppet.

38:14.480 --> 38:18.379
Apparently, there's
a fairly decent hotel there.

38:18.581 --> 38:21.877
- Not as grand as this one, of course.
- Grand?

38:22.115 --> 38:27.913
My dear Mr. Moresby,
this is positively luxurious.

38:28.149 --> 38:32.776
They say it's the best hotel
from here to the Congo.

38:33.017 --> 38:37.541
From now on, there's nothing
with running water.

38:37.852 --> 38:41.250
Nothing at all.

39:12.592 --> 39:14.218
Mr. Moresby?

39:14.459 --> 39:16.925
Mind if I join you?

39:20.327 --> 39:23.123
Pretty damn dull, isn't it, Boussif?

39:23.328 --> 39:26.420
Even worse with Mother Lyle around.

39:27.895 --> 39:30.862
I was wondering,
could you lend me something?

39:31.096 --> 39:34.995
Just a little. Say 10,000 francs?

39:35.264 --> 39:39.754
Five thousand perhaps?
As a loan, of course.

39:40.298 --> 39:46.391
I'm not one of those stupid people who
think all Americans are millionaires.

39:46.633 --> 39:51.827
It's just that my mother's mad.
She won't give me a penny.

39:52.067 --> 39:54.125
So, what am I supposed to do?

39:54.367 --> 39:58.801
Even 500 would keep me in smokes
for a fortnight.

40:01.002 --> 40:05.231
I'd never get it back.
And I haven't got it to give away.

40:05.504 --> 40:09.301
I can let you have 300 francs,
if that's any use to you.

40:09.538 --> 40:14.766
I notice you smoke the local tobacco.
Fortunately, it's very cheap.

41:26.454 --> 41:30.512
Oh, my God! Tunner!

41:31.622 --> 41:33.054
Tunner!

41:33.488 --> 41:35.250
Wake up!

41:35.489 --> 41:38.922
- Wake up, Tunner!
- What? What is it?

41:39.123 --> 41:41.282
- You're in my room!
- Hi.

41:41.524 --> 41:43.990
- Hi. Get out of here.
- Jesus.

41:45.358 --> 41:49.621
- What time is it?
- It's almost midday. I don't know.

41:50.459 --> 41:54.517
What happened?
I can't remember anything!

42:06.662 --> 42:10.561
- Tunner, I'll see you later.
- Yes, you will.

42:28.434 --> 42:30.923
- Tunner! Any champagne left?
- What?

42:31.168 --> 42:33.999
Champagne. I'm in a panic.

42:37.969 --> 42:40.197
- Last one.
- Thanks.

42:42.670 --> 42:45.159
Tunner, do I snore?

42:45.371 --> 42:48.701
Snore? No.

42:53.472 --> 42:56.371
- Hello.
- Hello.

43:01.874 --> 43:05.671
<i>Oh, Port and Kit
Oh, Kit and Port</i>

43:05.909 --> 43:09.706
<i>I love you, Port and Kit</i>

43:09.942 --> 43:14.899
<i>I love you, Kit and Port</i>

43:15.143 --> 43:18.633
- Will you trade me if my chain slips?
- No.

43:18.812 --> 43:23.609
If Tunner didn't take such long
siestas, I'd never be alone with you.

43:23.879 --> 43:26.209
I think he's in love with you.

43:26.447 --> 43:31.312
- Port, don't be silly.
- Sillier things have happened.

43:32.748 --> 43:37.078
The way he hangs around
making inane conversation.

43:38.449 --> 43:41.779
The way he looks at you
when he fingers his DDT can.

43:41.982 --> 43:44.006
What else?

43:45.117 --> 43:50.278
- The way he counts your luggage.
- He counts yours too.

43:50.485 --> 43:53.349
- It's not the same.
- Hey, look.

43:54.319 --> 43:58.013
Someday they'll kick
the French out of this country.

43:58.386 --> 44:02.012
Well, with trousers like that,
who can blame them?

44:28.393 --> 44:31.382
Can you make it to the pass?

44:31.660 --> 44:35.058
Hey, wait! Wait!

44:35.527 --> 44:38.255
- Bye!
- Wait!

44:39.094 --> 44:40.856
Wait!

45:15.036 --> 45:18.128
You know, I miss times like this...

45:18.336 --> 45:21.770
places like this,
more than anything in the world.

45:22.004 --> 45:24.129
I know you do.

45:29.573 --> 45:33.630
And this is what I wanted to show you.
This place.

45:36.106 --> 45:37.470
Yes.

45:42.541 --> 45:44.269
Come on.

48:06.672 --> 48:08.036
Here...

48:08.240 --> 48:10.604
the sky is so strange.

48:10.807 --> 48:13.534
It's almost solid.

48:14.740 --> 48:19.867
As if it were protecting us
from what's behind. Look.

48:20.575 --> 48:22.598
What's behind?

48:22.842 --> 48:25.400
It's nothing. Just night.

48:25.643 --> 48:28.439
I wish I could be like you,
but I can't.

48:28.677 --> 48:34.668
- Maybe we're afraid of the same thing.
- No. We're not!

48:36.378 --> 48:39.140
You're not afraid to be alone.

48:40.179 --> 48:44.909
And you don't need anything.
You don't need anyone.

48:45.147 --> 48:47.170
You could live without me.

48:49.281 --> 48:52.839
You know that, for me,
loving means loving you.

48:53.048 --> 48:57.709
No matter what's wrong between us,
there can never be anyone else.

49:10.386 --> 49:14.376
Maybe we're both afraid
of loving too much.

50:41.171 --> 50:43.433
Let's leave here.

50:46.306 --> 50:47.772
Okay.

50:48.374 --> 50:49.839
Okay.

52:49.465 --> 52:52.626
Pearl Harbor, Tunner.
We're being attacked!

52:55.500 --> 52:56.761
Jesus!

53:09.570 --> 53:12.230
Well, that's it then. On to Messad!

53:12.571 --> 53:15.595
Can't stay here a week. I'll be dead.

53:44.311 --> 53:46.039
Good morning.

53:46.277 --> 53:48.141
Good morning.

53:50.078 --> 53:51.942
My God!

53:52.179 --> 53:54.441
What are all these flies?

53:54.680 --> 53:57.306
Welcome to Ain Krorfa!

54:35.121 --> 54:38.952
It does have a smell
all of its own, doesn't it?

54:56.626 --> 55:00.320
Do you think Port suspects something?

55:01.994 --> 55:04.051
I think he knows.

55:04.361 --> 55:07.260
But he doesn't know that he knows.

55:38.768 --> 55:41.030
What is that song?

55:41.235 --> 55:43.224
I keep hearing it.

55:45.203 --> 55:47.999
"I am weeping on your grave."

55:48.203 --> 55:51.432
I am weeping for my gin and tonic.

55:52.471 --> 55:56.427
But according to Port,
one eventually gets used to anything.

55:56.672 --> 55:59.695
If that were true,
it'd be the end of progress.

55:59.906 --> 56:03.464
It's true. I just don't know
whether it's good or bad.

56:03.640 --> 56:05.197
Neither.

56:07.075 --> 56:09.836
This may be the only hotel in town...

56:10.041 --> 56:12.940
but I can do better at the market.
Look.

56:13.142 --> 56:14.801
Corpses.

56:15.309 --> 56:18.367
They're weevils.
Must have been in the noodles.

56:18.577 --> 56:21.043
Well, they're in the soup now.

56:24.144 --> 56:26.235
The bowl's thick with them.

56:28.845 --> 56:32.778
You all can eat here
at Carrion Towers if you like.

56:33.013 --> 56:36.071
I can find better stuff
than this at the market.

56:37.014 --> 56:39.071
So long then.

56:45.049 --> 56:46.571
All right.

56:51.451 --> 56:56.111
It seems as if bad food is the only
way I can be alone with you.

56:56.418 --> 56:59.078
It is fairly awful, isn't it?

56:59.318 --> 57:02.752
- It truly is.
- Maybe they have eggs in the kitchen.

57:07.253 --> 57:09.186
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

57:10.088 --> 57:12.748
Away with these little brats.

57:12.955 --> 57:15.513
Come here, Mommy.

57:18.023 --> 57:21.046
- Go away!
- Go away!

57:22.091 --> 57:24.852
Sod off, you little bugger!

57:29.592 --> 57:31.558
Could you be happy here?

57:31.759 --> 57:33.157
Happy?

57:34.393 --> 57:36.325
Happy? How do you mean?

57:36.526 --> 57:40.186
I mean, could you like it here?

57:42.328 --> 57:44.294
How do I know?

57:44.961 --> 57:49.054
God, I wish you wouldn't
ask me questions like this.

57:50.329 --> 57:53.387
Really, I can't answer them.

57:53.731 --> 57:58.096
What do you want me to say?
Yes, I'll be happy in Africa.

57:58.298 --> 58:01.288
I like Ain Krorfa so much.

58:01.498 --> 58:05.659
But I can't tell if I want
to stay a month or leave tomorrow.

58:05.899 --> 58:08.832
You couldn't leave tomorrow
even if you wanted to.

58:09.034 --> 58:10.966
- Hi.
- Hi.

58:11.334 --> 58:14.630
I can't get any information
about how to leave.

58:14.835 --> 58:18.427
No buses. Not even a fruit truck.
Nobody speaks English.

58:19.836 --> 58:23.633
- Anybody for a nightcap?
- Not for me.

58:25.537 --> 58:27.560
Well, then good night.

58:31.905 --> 58:33.495
You sure?

58:33.705 --> 58:36.228
That's kind of you. Thanks, but no.

58:36.439 --> 58:38.871
- Good night.
- Port?

58:39.407 --> 58:41.100
Good night.

59:03.045 --> 59:04.602
Come in.

59:04.812 --> 59:07.335
It's me, Eric.

59:07.579 --> 59:11.740
I hope I'm not disturbing you,
old man.

59:15.115 --> 59:17.774
Why are you tiptoeing?

59:19.415 --> 59:21.279
I don't know.

59:23.683 --> 59:27.309
It's about the money you lent me.
I came to pay it back.

59:27.517 --> 59:29.745
You don't need to. It was a gift.

59:29.951 --> 59:33.179
I'd like to all the same really.

59:33.852 --> 59:36.512
It was 300...

59:38.753 --> 59:41.219
Three hundred francs, wasn't it?

59:41.420 --> 59:44.080
Mother and I are leaving
in the morning.

59:44.321 --> 59:47.685
I knew you were here.
Hope you have change for 1000.

59:48.254 --> 59:51.517
- Would you like me to look?
- Lf you could.

59:53.722 --> 59:57.314
- Where are you going tomorrow?
- Messad.

59:57.490 --> 59:59.423
You're kidding.

59:59.623 --> 01:00:05.649
That is exactly where my friend
would like to go. Mr. Tunner.

01:00:05.859 --> 01:00:08.382
- Oh?
- Yes.

01:00:09.626 --> 01:00:11.251
I...

01:00:11.459 --> 01:00:16.085
Well, we're leaving before dawn.

01:00:16.293 --> 01:00:19.260
I could go and tell him right away.

01:00:19.461 --> 01:00:23.622
I mean, you wouldn't mind
giving him a lift, would you?

01:00:23.828 --> 01:00:26.351
Could you stomach
one of my cigarettes?

01:00:26.562 --> 01:00:28.926
Oh, yes. Thank you.

01:00:29.163 --> 01:00:31.959
We can forget about the money.

01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:36.529
Oh, well... all right.

01:00:37.698 --> 01:00:41.825
If you really want to get rid of him.

01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:48.833
Excuse me.

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:18.529
"K: Gone to Messad with the Lyles.

01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:21.571
Maybe I can find you
some more champagne.

01:01:21.775 --> 01:01:25.731
See you in Bou Noura. Love, Tunner."

01:01:41.146 --> 01:01:45.374
- So, what happened to Tunner?
- Gone with the monsters.

01:01:45.579 --> 01:01:49.034
- He left me his cushion.
- Good.

01:01:49.247 --> 01:01:52.510
So the plan is to meet
in Bou Noura in a few days?

01:01:52.714 --> 01:01:54.704
More or less, yes.

01:01:54.982 --> 01:01:56.777
More or less?

01:01:58.149 --> 01:02:00.240
Less, actually.

01:02:02.483 --> 01:02:06.075
- Port, are you packing?
- Yes, I am.

01:02:06.284 --> 01:02:10.512
- There's a bus to Bou Noura after all.
- A bus today?

01:02:10.685 --> 01:02:13.015
It only leaves in the afternoons.

01:02:13.218 --> 01:02:16.242
Strange kind of bus.
It didn't exist yesterday.

01:02:16.453 --> 01:02:21.079
You know how transport is around here.
Always improvised.

01:02:23.988 --> 01:02:25.545
This trunk...

01:02:26.889 --> 01:02:31.185
<i>You wrote Mexican Overture sitting
on top of this trunk. Remember?</i>

01:02:31.423 --> 01:02:33.855
- Did I?
- Yes.

01:02:41.158 --> 01:02:44.091
So we're off on our own then?

01:02:44.259 --> 01:02:45.555
Yes.

01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:50.083
We've been married a long time, Port.

01:02:50.293 --> 01:02:53.055
I don't think 10 years
is such a long time.

01:04:32.415 --> 01:04:35.506
- What in God's name are you doing?
- Celebrating.

01:04:35.716 --> 01:04:38.512
I'm not sure what I'm celebrating,
but I am.

01:04:38.717 --> 01:04:42.411
I felt like I was going to die
if I didn't see my things.

01:04:42.617 --> 01:04:46.982
We've been living like refugees.
I haven't unpacked since the boat.

01:04:49.552 --> 01:04:52.950
The only trouble is,
there are no mirrors here.

01:04:54.286 --> 01:04:58.242
- So how do I look?
- Well...

01:04:58.420 --> 01:05:02.513
Have you seen my glasses?
The ones with the clip-ons?

01:05:02.722 --> 01:05:06.678
Have you seen my passport?
The one with the photo?

01:05:06.889 --> 01:05:08.411
No!

01:05:09.290 --> 01:05:11.848
- I lost it.
- You haven't!

01:05:12.056 --> 01:05:15.490
Well, in that case,
I feel much better. Yes, I have.

01:05:15.691 --> 01:05:18.283
God, what a bore!

01:05:19.658 --> 01:05:23.183
Have you seen anyone in my room
since we got here?

01:05:23.425 --> 01:05:27.483
Are you sure
you looked through everything?

01:05:28.294 --> 01:05:32.454
- Port, are you cold?
- Yeah, I am a little bit.

01:05:34.428 --> 01:05:37.259
Well, I should notify someone.

01:05:37.862 --> 01:05:41.295
The sooner the better, I suppose.

01:05:46.931 --> 01:05:49.796
Do you think sooner is better?

01:06:00.234 --> 01:06:01.995
By the way...

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.194
you look okay.

01:06:58.846 --> 01:07:00.176
Hi.

01:07:00.379 --> 01:07:03.437
My passport wasn't lost.
Eric Lyle stole it.

01:07:04.114 --> 01:07:06.376
I told you he was a criminal!

01:07:06.581 --> 01:07:11.378
The lieutenant says it'll end up at
the Foreign Legion barracks in Messad.

01:07:11.548 --> 01:07:16.209
It'll bring a high price.
That's exactly where Eric was headed.

01:07:19.650 --> 01:07:24.050
I find it awfully peculiar that
someone could be constantly cold...

01:07:24.251 --> 01:07:26.911
in the Sahara Desert in September.

01:07:27.119 --> 01:07:30.245
I'll feel better
once we get to El Ga'a.

01:07:30.986 --> 01:07:32.077
El Ga'a?

01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:35.009
It's the most beautiful city
in the Sahara.

01:07:35.010 --> 01:07:37.801
It's odd to be here
without official proof.

01:07:38.010 --> 01:07:40.176
When are we going to El Ga'a?

01:07:40.384 --> 01:07:44.176
We could have taken the bus
tomorrow, but it was full.

01:07:44.342 --> 01:07:47.174
Don't worry. I'll pack your things.

01:07:51.257 --> 01:07:55.090
So, what about our plans?
What about Tunner?

01:07:55.298 --> 01:07:56.548
What about Tunner?

01:07:56.756 --> 01:08:00.756
He'll catch up,
or maybe we'll still be here.

01:08:19.127 --> 01:08:23.126
- We're standing in a cemetery.
- We are?

01:08:23.792 --> 01:08:25.959
Look at the markers.

01:08:26.167 --> 01:08:31.332
No names, no dates.
Just pieces of broken pottery.

01:08:33.416 --> 01:08:36.916
Don't you ever think we should stop?

01:08:37.332 --> 01:08:40.956
- Stay somewhere, at least for a while?
- Stop?

01:08:41.206 --> 01:08:43.872
Really stop? Stopping?

01:08:44.538 --> 01:08:46.288
Maybe we could in El Ga'a.

01:08:46.497 --> 01:08:50.412
It's supposed to be very beautiful
there and much warmer.

01:08:50.621 --> 01:08:54.371
Timbuktu, El Ga'a,
it doesn't make any difference.

01:08:54.578 --> 01:08:58.953
But if you'll be happier or feel
better, then we'll go to El Ga'a.

01:08:59.161 --> 01:09:02.662
Then we'll stay in El Ga'a.

01:12:37.371 --> 01:12:39.079
Wait.

01:14:45.681 --> 01:14:47.389
Port?

01:14:47.597 --> 01:14:49.056
Come on, get up.

01:14:49.264 --> 01:14:51.931
Honey, you'll ruin your back. Get up.

01:14:54.804 --> 01:14:56.554
Come, sit up.

01:14:56.763 --> 01:14:58.012
Port, please.

01:14:58.221 --> 01:15:01.386
Come on. Sit up. I'll help you.

01:15:02.094 --> 01:15:04.094
Port, please.

01:15:07.053 --> 01:15:10.260
Come on, Port. Come on.

01:15:11.010 --> 01:15:12.384
There.

01:15:13.718 --> 01:15:16.967
Here, let me cover you.
You're freezing.

01:15:17.759 --> 01:15:19.258
Is that better?

01:15:19.509 --> 01:15:21.217
My God!

01:15:25.132 --> 01:15:28.131
Something is really wrong with me.

01:15:28.298 --> 01:15:30.173
What do you think it is?

01:15:35.048 --> 01:15:38.130
When do we arrive? Until noon?

01:15:38.339 --> 01:15:42.213
You need to sleep. Come on, darling,
put your head here.

01:15:43.045 --> 01:15:45.712
You just need to sleep. Okay?

01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:47.712
Can you rest?

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:50.920
You'll feel better if you sleep.
Can you sleep?

01:15:51.169 --> 01:15:55.502
You haven't called me darling
for more...

01:15:55.710 --> 01:15:57.627
than a year.

01:17:12.030 --> 01:17:13.820
You all right?

01:17:16.071 --> 01:17:18.362
- You all right?
- Yes, I slept well.

01:17:18.528 --> 01:17:24.194
- It's great here.
- Oh, my God. It's wonderful.

01:17:24.693 --> 01:17:26.152
Look at it.

01:17:28.401 --> 01:17:31.692
And you've arranged my suite of rooms?

01:17:32.567 --> 01:17:37.775
- I found the four-star restaurant too.
- Drinks on the veranda in a half-hour.

01:17:37.983 --> 01:17:41.940
- I love them together like this.
- As opposed to individually.

01:17:42.107 --> 01:17:44.357
I didn't mean that. Why must you...?

01:17:44.523 --> 01:17:49.022
Port, what is it? What's wrong?
Port, can you get up?

01:17:51.605 --> 01:17:54.854
Get up. Try to stand.
Just try to stand, please.

01:17:55.064 --> 01:17:57.604
Can you walk? Please?

01:17:58.146 --> 01:18:00.646
Are you here? Are you here?

01:18:00.853 --> 01:18:04.187
- Yeah.
- Stand up. Put your arm around me.

01:18:04.394 --> 01:18:06.187
I bit my tongue.

01:18:06.436 --> 01:18:09.477
Right this way. It's all right.

01:18:14.976 --> 01:18:18.684
I always wondered what
it would be like to bite my tongue.

01:18:18.892 --> 01:18:21.849
Can you walk
just a little bit further?

01:18:22.808 --> 01:18:25.432
If you stay in one place,
you'll be fine.

01:18:25.641 --> 01:18:28.058
Port, stand up, please!

01:18:28.641 --> 01:18:31.641
- Please! Are you all right?
- Do I have a fever?

01:18:31.890 --> 01:18:33.890
Yes, sweetie, you're very hot.

01:18:40.014 --> 01:18:41.346
Please, Port...

01:18:41.555 --> 01:18:47.178
- Don't panic. I'll take care of you.
- What was that hotel in Salzburg...

01:18:47.345 --> 01:18:52.345
with reindeer on those plates?
- Port, can you stay here?

01:18:52.553 --> 01:18:54.928
I'm... Yes, I'm all right.

01:18:55.135 --> 01:18:56.718
Hurry.

01:18:56.927 --> 01:18:58.468
I'll hurry.

01:19:04.592 --> 01:19:06.216
Hotel du Ksar?

01:19:08.883 --> 01:19:11.883
- You're all right?
- Yes, good.

01:19:13.382 --> 01:19:16.257
- I'm cold.
- Port...

01:19:16.881 --> 01:19:19.173
I'll be right back.

01:20:49.906 --> 01:20:52.822
- Open up, please!
- Who are you, madame?

01:20:54.696 --> 01:20:57.071
You cannot expect me to let you in.

01:20:57.279 --> 01:21:00.488
So far, we are free of the epidemic
in this hotel.

01:21:01.071 --> 01:21:03.112
Madame, what epidemic?

01:21:03.321 --> 01:21:04.986
You did not know?

01:21:09.486 --> 01:21:11.153
Calm. I have to think.

01:21:46.479 --> 01:21:47.812
We must leave here.

01:22:02.101 --> 01:22:03.642
Port?

01:22:21.973 --> 01:22:23.638
Port!

01:22:31.221 --> 01:22:33.553
Shut up! Shut up!

01:22:36.969 --> 01:22:38.428
Port, you...

01:22:39.136 --> 01:22:42.303
You have to help me.
I can't do this alone.

01:22:45.385 --> 01:22:47.760
- Play.
- Can you hear me?

01:23:24.337 --> 01:23:28.835
Porter, can you hear me?
I found a truck.

01:23:29.044 --> 01:23:33.627
It's going to a village called SbÃ¢.
They say there's a fort.

01:23:33.834 --> 01:23:37.917
The Foreign Legion is there.
It's going to be all right.

01:23:38.167 --> 01:23:40.083
It's going to be fine.

01:23:58.538 --> 01:24:02.370
Okay? All right, baby? All right?

01:24:45.196 --> 01:24:47.988
- Can typhoid kill you?
- Not always.

01:24:49.196 --> 01:24:53.569
My men will bring a mattress.
It will not be very comfortable.

01:24:53.736 --> 01:24:55.777
But what can you expect?

01:24:55.986 --> 01:24:58.944
You are in SbÃ¢, not in Paris.

01:24:59.611 --> 01:25:03.151
Give him the pills every two hours.

01:25:03.359 --> 01:25:05.902
Be courageous, madame.

01:25:30.897 --> 01:25:32.396
You have to take these.

01:25:32.645 --> 01:25:36.896
There are two pills.
I want you to swallow them. Here.

01:25:37.103 --> 01:25:39.227
And here's some water.

01:25:53.142 --> 01:25:55.725
It's time for your pills.

01:25:55.974 --> 01:25:58.558
Time for your pills.

01:26:02.223 --> 01:26:04.223
Here you go.

01:26:04.806 --> 01:26:06.347
Here they are.

01:26:06.599 --> 01:26:08.638
Here's some water.

01:26:08.890 --> 01:26:10.972
Try to swallow.

01:26:11.222 --> 01:26:13.221
Did you get it?

01:26:15.596 --> 01:26:19.263
I'm gonna go out, all right?

01:26:20.595 --> 01:26:23.179
I'm going to get some air.

01:26:25.136 --> 01:26:27.719
I'll be back in a little bit.

01:26:28.178 --> 01:26:31.927
You feel cooler. Yes.

01:28:33.070 --> 01:28:37.194
Why don't you try to have some soup?
It looks good.

01:28:37.738 --> 01:28:39.737
Can you sit up?

01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:46.027
Good.

01:28:46.235 --> 01:28:47.819
Here.

01:28:51.110 --> 01:28:53.400
Try to swallow it.

01:29:00.232 --> 01:29:02.815
Try again. Here.

01:29:04.065 --> 01:29:07.939
Please try some more. It's hot now.

01:31:53.201 --> 01:31:55.076
Here.

01:31:55.284 --> 01:32:00.783
I've put your pills with warm milk.
Please try to swallow it. Can you?

01:32:01.034 --> 01:32:02.824
Can you try to swallow?

01:32:03.033 --> 01:32:06.198
Just swallow. There's more, okay?

01:32:06.449 --> 01:32:09.407
Swallow, honey. Swallow.

01:32:12.447 --> 01:32:16.989
Can you swallow? I know, I know.

01:32:23.071 --> 01:32:24.778
Can you try?

01:32:25.029 --> 01:32:27.653
Swallow, please. Please.

01:32:35.526 --> 01:32:36.776
Okay.

01:33:37.931 --> 01:33:39.515
Yes?

01:33:44.055 --> 01:33:47.430
I was trying to get back.

01:33:47.638 --> 01:33:50.638
- And right now, I am.
- Yes.

01:33:50.888 --> 01:33:55.429
- Is there anyone here?
- What?

01:33:55.678 --> 01:33:59.428
- Is there anyone here?
- No, no.

01:33:59.636 --> 01:34:04.260
- No, there's nobody here.
- Hi, how are you? Good to see you.

01:34:04.510 --> 01:34:07.093
Is that door locked?

01:34:08.509 --> 01:34:10.342
Yes.

01:34:11.259 --> 01:34:12.676
Because there are...

01:34:15.259 --> 01:34:18.966
There are these things I want
to tell you, but I don't...

01:34:19.175 --> 01:34:21.132
I can't remember them all.

01:34:21.340 --> 01:34:24.507
Yes, well, a fever's like that.

01:34:24.715 --> 01:34:27.506
Do you want some warm milk?

01:34:27.715 --> 01:34:31.963
I don't think... I don't think
there's time. I don't know.

01:34:32.173 --> 01:34:36.130
- No, I'll just go get it.
- Please, please, stay here.

01:34:36.337 --> 01:34:38.504
I'm glad you're better.
I'm going crazy.

01:34:38.753 --> 01:34:44.170
There's not a soul around.
I didn't have anyone to talk to...

01:34:44.378 --> 01:34:47.669
I know that I shouldn't be afraid
but I am.

01:34:47.919 --> 01:34:49.918
Because sometimes I...

01:34:50.169 --> 01:34:52.293
I'm not here.

01:34:53.001 --> 01:34:54.834
And there...

01:34:55.085 --> 01:34:57.625
is so far away.

01:34:57.834 --> 01:34:59.876
And I'm all alone.

01:35:00.125 --> 01:35:05.623
You don't know, you know.
I don't think anyone could get there.

01:35:08.790 --> 01:35:12.165
No, no, Port, you have to stay down.

01:35:13.164 --> 01:35:16.164
You know how awful it is?

01:35:17.539 --> 01:35:20.621
See, Kit...

01:35:21.204 --> 01:35:23.871
all those years...

01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:28.036
I lived for you
and I didn't know it.

01:35:28.245 --> 01:35:30.870
And now I do know it.

01:35:31.328 --> 01:35:33.745
Yeah, I know it.

01:35:34.578 --> 01:35:36.994
- I'm right here.
- You're going away...

01:35:37.243 --> 01:35:39.869
No, I'm not going away.
I'm right here.

01:35:40.076 --> 01:35:44.367
I am here, Port. I am here.

01:35:44.616 --> 01:35:48.574
Will you stay here?
Will you stay here?

01:35:48.825 --> 01:35:51.032
Please stay in this room.

01:35:51.324 --> 01:35:53.990
- Port, I'm here.
- I can't...

01:35:54.615 --> 01:35:57.740
No, no!

01:36:01.989 --> 01:36:05.946
Stay here. Port, please stay here.

01:36:06.196 --> 01:36:08.237
Stay with me.

01:36:15.528 --> 01:36:17.610
Look at me.

01:36:19.444 --> 01:36:23.443
Here. I'm right here. See me?

01:36:23.693 --> 01:36:26.359
Stay here, please.

01:36:33.316 --> 01:36:35.442
Please don't go.

01:36:35.649 --> 01:36:40.982
Please don't go. Please. Please.

01:38:03.383 --> 01:38:05.674
Can you help me?
Is there a doctor?

01:38:51.666 --> 01:38:53.457
Anyone!

01:38:53.666 --> 01:38:55.124
Help me!

01:38:59.165 --> 01:39:03.080
Can you help me? Please!

01:39:03.289 --> 01:39:07.663
Can somebody help me? Please!

01:42:45.706 --> 01:42:47.747
Can you put this up?

01:42:47.998 --> 01:42:50.747
Please take it. Please.

01:46:10.377 --> 01:46:11.876
No!

01:58:16.245 --> 01:58:17.868
Toes.

01:58:46.404 --> 01:58:47.863
Knees.

01:58:55.404 --> 01:58:56.986
Thighs.

02:01:42.498 --> 02:01:44.164
Like it?

02:03:25.021 --> 02:03:26.521
Bye.

02:03:57.723 --> 02:03:59.139
Oh, dear.

02:03:59.348 --> 02:04:01.139
I say.

02:04:02.180 --> 02:04:04.180
- It's that Tunner fellow.
- What?

02:04:07.389 --> 02:04:09.513
- He's still here.
- Come on.

02:04:13.388 --> 02:04:15.719
Come on!

02:04:26.885 --> 02:04:30.676
Hello there. Hello.

02:04:30.925 --> 02:04:35.258
I thought you'd gone back to America.

02:04:35.508 --> 02:04:38.924
- How long have you been in Bou Noura?
- Three months.

02:04:39.174 --> 02:04:43.465
Are you here with the Moresbys?
What charming people they were.

02:04:43.714 --> 02:04:46.382
You heard from them at all?

02:04:46.756 --> 02:04:48.756
Yes, they're fine.

02:04:50.214 --> 02:04:52.047
Will you excuse me?

02:09:33.370 --> 02:09:35.619
Here. Here.

02:09:36.036 --> 02:09:37.786
Here, take it.

02:09:39.911 --> 02:09:42.284
Take it, it's money. It's real.

02:09:42.535 --> 02:09:45.700
It's French money, can't you see?
Take it all.

02:09:45.951 --> 02:09:47.493
No! What are you...?

02:09:47.785 --> 02:09:50.408
Watch it! No!
Can't you leave me...?

02:09:50.617 --> 02:09:54.450
Please! Let me go!

02:09:54.783 --> 02:09:56.866
Let me go, please!

02:10:01.198 --> 02:10:02.531
No!

02:10:02.781 --> 02:10:04.531
Please let go!

02:10:04.781 --> 02:10:06.406
Let go!

02:10:07.738 --> 02:10:09.656
Oh, God!

02:10:10.030 --> 02:10:11.613
Please!

02:10:12.072 --> 02:10:16.528
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe!

02:10:19.111 --> 02:10:21.944
No!

02:10:27.319 --> 02:10:29.401
Let go!

02:10:30.109 --> 02:10:31.692
Please!

02:10:51.231 --> 02:10:53.897
Mrs. Katherine Moresby?

02:10:54.771 --> 02:10:57.355
I'm from the American Embassy.

02:11:00.646 --> 02:11:03.687
You must be absolutely exhausted.

02:11:04.436 --> 02:11:07.602
I flew all the way here
to bring you back.

02:11:12.268 --> 02:11:14.893
How long have you been down here?

02:11:39.305 --> 02:11:42.970
We're putting you in the Grand Hotel.
It's comfortable.

02:11:43.222 --> 02:11:48.221
It's not good, but it's better than
anything in your neck of the woods.

02:11:48.762 --> 02:11:50.928
A friend of yours, Mr. Tunner...

02:11:51.178 --> 02:11:54.719
has sent the consulate wires
and letters for months.

02:11:54.927 --> 02:11:58.801
He was very upset, so we let him know
we'd found you.

02:12:01.676 --> 02:12:04.092
I hope you don't mind
my presumption...

02:12:04.300 --> 02:12:08.758
but as soon as we were sure you'd
be coming, I wired Mr. Tunner.

02:12:08.966 --> 02:12:11.840
I shouldn't be surprised
if he's in town.

02:12:12.091 --> 02:12:13.757
Probably at the Grand.

02:12:26.713 --> 02:12:28.421
Ah, then, here we are.

02:12:28.671 --> 02:12:31.504
I'll keep the taxicab for myself.

02:12:33.670 --> 02:12:36.378
Well, then, I'll go inside and see.

02:13:29.285 --> 02:13:30.618
Kit.

02:14:27.399 --> 02:14:29.566
Are you lost?

02:14:30.774 --> 02:14:32.231
Yes.

02:14:34.314 --> 02:14:37.231
Because we don't know
when we will die...

02:14:37.481 --> 02:14:41.146
we get to think of life
as an inexhaustible well,

02:14:41.396 --> 02:14:46.562
Things happen only a certain number
of times, And a small number, really,

02:14:46.854 --> 02:14:51.103
How many times will you remember
an afternoon of your childhood...

02:14:51.312 --> 02:14:57.061
an afternoon so deeply a part
of you that you can't be without it?

02:14:57.269 --> 02:15:01.518
Perhaps four or five times more,
Perhaps not even that,

02:15:01.727 --> 02:15:04.725
How many times will
you watch the moon rise?

02:15:04.976 --> 02:15:06.809
Perhaps 20,

02:15:07.059 --> 02:15:10.516
And yet it all seems limitless,
