I would like

24:43.107 --> 24:44.859
to dedicate this concert

24:45.193 --> 24:46.615
to him

24:47.195 --> 24:50.324
and to all the other victims of state terror

24:50.531 --> 24:53.034
everywhere, all over the world.

24:55.411 --> 24:57.129
When I was young myself

24:58.289 --> 25:00.667
We played in London.

25:01.250 --> 25:04.754
We filmed some shows there.

25:04.962 --> 25:09.308
I have a small piece of film here tonight.

25:09.509 --> 25:10.977
And this... ah?

25:12.803 --> 25:17.400
...is a clip of me singing the song Mother.

25:21.562 --> 25:23.985
I will try to sing a double track vocal

25:24.190 --> 25:26.113
and play the acoustic guitar

25:26.317 --> 25:31.118
with that poor, miserable,
fucked up little Roger

25:31.322 --> 25:34.201
from all those years ago.

25:37.078 --> 25:38.705
So!

25:40.039 --> 25:41.586
Wish us luck!

<i># Mama won't let anyone dirty get through</i>

31:13.122 --> 31:17.047

<i># Mother, did it need to be so high? #</i>

32:28.572 --> 32:29.994
Well, thank you.

32:36.205 --> 32:39.209
I feel as if we've been driving
around in circles for hours.

32:39.416 --> 32:41.714
Well, it's the landscape, isn't it?

32:41.919 --> 32:43.671
Yeah. It's the French, I think.

32:46.298 --> 32:47.720
Where was I?

32:47.925 --> 32:52.055
Oh, yeah, there's that movie
about a Russian lorry driver

32:52.680 --> 32:54.432
and he breaks down in Mongolia.

32:55.516 --> 32:57.939
There's this scene
where he gets very, very drunk

32:58.143 --> 33:00.987
and he makes this long,
impassioned speech

33:01.188 --> 33:04.192
about the fact that he can't
remember his grandfather's name.

33:05.275 --> 33:07.869
When I saw that
it was like a dagger in my heart.

33:08.070 --> 33:09.492
And I went, "Oh, my God."

33:09.697 --> 33:11.119
I thought, "My grandfather,

33:11.323 --> 33:13.291
what the fuck
was my grandfather's name?"

33:13.492 --> 33:14.914
And I panicked.

33:15.244 --> 33:18.714
And a few seconds later,
through the panic,

33:18.914 --> 33:20.757
I went, "George Henry."

33:29.591 --> 33:32.060
He was killed here in 1916.

33:33.137 --> 33:36.311
I mean, it's impossible to imagine
what it must have been like.

33:36.598 --> 33:39.351
Pitch black, frightened out of your wits.

33:39.560 --> 33:42.905
The guys in the trenches
must have realised pretty early on

33:43.105 --> 33:45.233
that the people
who were making the decisions

33:45.441 --> 33:47.193
had no fucking idea what they were doing.

33:47.401 --> 33:48.823
Of course not.

33:49.028 --> 33:50.996
The whole thing was insane,
had been from the beginning,

33:51.196 --> 33:52.664
and would go on being crazy

33:52.865 --> 33:57.587
until the end when they
called it a draw and went home.

33:58.662 --> 34:02.712
And how old was your father
when his father died?

34:03.375 --> 34:04.797
Two.

34:05.002 --> 34:08.051
So that's two wars that took away

34:08.464 --> 34:12.889
even the direct memory of fathers
from two sons.

34:13.092 --> 34:14.514
Yeah.

35:32.381 --> 35:34.850
"Most rulers lie,

35:35.217 --> 35:37.845
"yet lies are less shocking, less corrosive

35:38.929 --> 35:43.981
"than the chosen, cultivated ignorance
Chevallier addresses here.

35:45.644 --> 35:49.899
"This ignorance denies the reality
of anything which provokes pity.

35:51.024 --> 35:54.369
"İt is an error to think of such war leaders,

35:54.653 --> 35:58.499
"or, today, economic strategists,
as pitiless.

35:59.616 --> 36:01.869
"They are abject.

36:03.245 --> 36:07.170
"This is what we have to learn
and to act upon.

36:07.791 --> 36:10.135
"They are abject."

36:15.966 --> 36:19.311
George Henry, hewer of coal.

36:24.725 --> 36:27.604
It's been an ambition of mine
to come here with you three.

36:29.313 --> 36:33.989
Two great-grandsons,
great-granddaughter, and a grandson.

36:49.416 --> 36:52.465
It's two million men. Amazing.

37:15.192 --> 37:17.035
You can plan
to meet people in your dreams.

37:17.236 --> 37:18.658
Can you?
Yeah.

37:18.862 --> 37:20.455
Well, when you go to bed tonight,

37:20.656 --> 37:24.035
I want you to plan to meet George Henry
in your dreams.

37:26.662 --> 37:28.460
I once dreamt
that I jumped down a hill,

37:28.664 --> 37:30.337
but I landed near a bear and it ate me.

37:30.958 --> 37:34.087
It's possible that you were
having anxieties about the Russians.

37:35.921 --> 37:37.639
Or just bears in general.

37:37.839 --> 37:39.432
That's possible too.

37:40.050 --> 37:43.805
I've never been in control of a dream
where I went, "Oh, I'm dreaming.

37:44.012 --> 37:46.390
"Now I can do this, or that, or the other."

37:46.598 --> 37:48.771
I had that once and then I lost control,

37:48.976 --> 37:52.526
and started getting attacked
by World War 2-era Japanese soldiers.

37:53.188 --> 37:55.611
You were getting attacked
by Japanese soldiers?

37:55.816 --> 37:58.160
Yeah.
Wow.

38:20.632 --> 38:23.886

50:38.619 --> 50:40.166
<i>As for her maid,</i>

50:40.371 --> 50:42.465
<i>she can have her meal
with the kitchen help.</i>

50:42.665 --> 50:44.087
<i>Very good, sir.</i>

50:44.292 --> 50:46.545
<i>If you'll just let me know
as soon as you can.</i>

50:54.802 --> 50:59.683
<i># Day after day, love turns grey</i>

51:00.725 --> 51:04.480
<i># Like the skin of a dying man</i>

<i># Night after night, we pretend it's all right</i>

51:14.572 --> 51:17.701
<i># But I have grown older</i>

51:17.909 --> 51:20.879
<i># And you have grown colder</i>

51:21.079 --> 51:27.052
<i># And nothing is very much fun any more</i>

51:27.835 --> 51:32.932
<i># And I can feel</i>

51:34.550 --> 51:38.475
<i># One of my turns coming on</i>

51:41.182 --> 51:46.313
<i># I feel</i>

51:47.897 --> 51:51.117
<i># Cold as a razor blade</i>

51:51.317 --> 51:54.366
<i># Tight as a tourniquet</i>

<i># Dry as a funeral drum</i>

<i># Run to the bedroom</i>

<i># Don't look so frightened</i>

52:16.259 --> 52:18.478
<i># This is just a passing phase</i>

52:18.678 --> 52:21.181
<i># One of my bad days</i>

52:24.433 --> 52:27.357
<i># Would you like to watch TV?</i>

52:27.562 --> 52:29.064
<i># Or get between the sheets?</i>

52:29.272 --> 52:32.526
<i># Or contemplate the silent freeway?</i>

52:32.733 --> 52:35.111
<i># Would you like something to eat?</i>

52:35.319 --> 52:37.742
<i># Would you like to learn to fly?</i>

52:40.867 --> 52:43.336
<i># Would you like to see me try?</i>

53:18.821 --> 53:21.290
<i># Would you like to call the cops?</i>

53:21.949 --> 53:24.168
<i># Do you think it's time I stopped?</i>

53:25.369 --> 53:32.298
<i># Why are you running away? #</i>

54:22.218 --> 54:25.097
<i># Ooooh, babe</i>

54:28.099 --> 54:30.352
<i># Don't leave me now</i>

54:43.614 --> 54:47.619
<i># Don't say it's the end of the road</i>

54:52.832 --> 54:56.006
<i># Remember the flowers I sent</i>

54:57.878 --> 55:00.882
<i>#1 need you, babe</i>

55:04.468 --> 55:09.395
<i># To put through the shredder
in front of my friends</i>

55:09.598 --> 55:11.942
<i># Ooooh, babe</i>

55:14.937 --> 55:17.110
<i># Don't leave me now</i>

55:26.407 --> 55:28.626
<i># How could you go?</i>

55:39.295 --> 55:42.424
<i># When you know how I need you</i>

55:42.631 --> 55:47.228
<i># Need you, need you, need you</i>

55:51.223 --> 55:56.275
<i># To beat to a pulp on a Saturday night</i>

55:56.479 --> 55:58.857
<i># Ooooh, babe</i>

56:01.776 --> 56:03.904
<i># Don't leave me now</i>

56:17.750 --> 56:21.220
<i># How can you treat me this way?</i>

56:25.049 --> 56:26.847
<i># Running away</i>

56:34.016 --> 56:36.485
<i># Oooh, babe</i>

56:39.688 --> 56:44.068
<i># Why are you running away?</i>

56:44.276 --> 56:51.251
<i># Oooh, babe</i>

56:55.871 --> 57:02.129
<i># Oooh, babe</i>

57:07.591 --> 57:14.475
<i># Oooh, babe</i>

57:19.228 --> 57:23.574
<i># Oooh...</i>

57:29.947 --> 57:32.951
<i># Ooohhh #</i>

57:40.708 --> 57:42.130
Where are we?

57:43.377 --> 57:44.799
France.

57:46.255 --> 57:48.053
<i>And where are we on our way to?</i>

57:48.924 --> 57:50.346
<i>MAN". Italy.</i>

57:50.926 --> 57:52.348
<i>That's right, we are.</i>

57:59.393 --> 58:01.191
<i>We'll have to go through tunnels.</i>

58:01.645 --> 58:03.113
I hope so.

58:06.901 --> 58:09.529
<i>Do you remember the last time
we went through tunnels?</i>

58:10.029 --> 58:11.952
<i>We must have been 17 or 18.</i>

58:13.908 --> 58:15.330
<i>We were on our way to Baghdad.</i>

58:15.701 --> 58:17.920
<i>No, we weren't. It was Istanbul.</i>

58:18.537 --> 58:19.959
<i>Was it?</i>

58:23.584 --> 58:25.336
<i>We did go through Greece, though.</i>

58:25.544 --> 58:27.262
<i>And we climbed Mount Olympus.</i>

58:29.423 --> 58:31.517
<i>Do you remember
being attacked by that dog?</i>

58:31.717 --> 58:33.139
No.

58:42.102 --> 58:43.945
<i>Do you remember a storm?</i>

58:44.230 --> 58:46.232
No, I don't.

58:46.440 --> 58:48.738
<i>We're doing well, then.</i>

58:48.943 --> 58:52.789
The human memory is a fallible device.

58:53.072 --> 58:54.494
Certainly at our age.

58:56.325 --> 58:59.454
Yeah, and that it's not something
that one should pay too much attention to.

58:59.662 --> 59:02.757
Do you want to hear the story of the
thunderstorm that you don't remember?

59:02.957 --> 59:04.379
- Yes, please.
-All right.

59:04.583 --> 59:06.005
So, we're going along...

59:06.210 --> 59:08.383
and there was a thunderclap.

59:09.672 --> 59:11.845
<i>The sound and the light
were simultaneous.</i>

59:13.133 --> 59:17.183
<i>And in that moment,
I completely lost my identity</i>

59:17.888 --> 59:19.356
<i>for about one second.</i>

59:21.100 --> 59:24.070
And in that one second,
I knew that I was unlimited.

59:24.311 --> 59:26.063
- I was on that mountaintop.
-Mmm.

59:26.272 --> 59:29.151
Probably no further from you
than that car.

59:29.358 --> 59:31.531
- Absolutely.
-And I don't remember any thunderbolt.

59:31.735 --> 59:33.157
No.

59:33.362 --> 59:35.456
So you're implying it might not
have happened at all.

59:35.656 --> 59:37.078
I'm not!

59:37.283 --> 59:39.206
I mean, well, yeah,
I am, of course I am.

59:39.410 --> 59:40.832
But on the other hand,

59:41.036 --> 59:43.915
it might easily have happened
and I just don't remember it.

59:44.123 --> 59:46.217
- Right.
-Maybe I was struck.

59:47.585 --> 59:49.007
<i>I used to have this dream...</i>

59:49.211 --> 59:51.839
<i>and the dream was
that I'd murdered somebody,</i>

59:52.047 --> 59:54.470
<i>and I felt unbelievably guilty about it.</i>

59:54.675 --> 59:57.929
<i>Finally, one day, I figured out that
I thought I'd killed my father.</i>

59:58.137 --> 01:00:00.139
<i>- Mmm-hmm.
-And I never had the dream again.</i>

01:00:00.347 --> 01:00:04.352
<i>That child in me, who took responsibility
for everything that happened around me,</i>

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:07.860
<i>I carried that into middle life.</i>

01:00:08.063 --> 01:00:10.532
I don't have to have that dream any more,
and I never have.

01:00:10.733 --> 01:00:12.155
Right.

01:00:12.359 --> 01:00:14.111
Well, I've certainly never remembered it.

01:00:15.029 --> 01:00:20.081
Well, all I will say,
since the only thing I really mentioned

01:00:20.284 --> 01:00:22.582
is Zeus revealing my unlimitedness...

01:00:22.786 --> 01:00:24.208
Right.

01:00:24.413 --> 01:00:27.007
<i>...is, I was in New York...</i>

01:00:27.207 --> 01:00:30.051
<i>because Nancy had
had her second son there,</i>

01:00:30.252 --> 01:00:35.179
<i>and I'm holding him like that,
and he looks at me, and he smiles.</i>

01:00:35.382 --> 01:00:38.932
And of course, we're programmed
to respond to that smile,

01:00:39.136 --> 01:00:40.558
and he's programmed to give it.

01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:42.602
But that isn't what I thought.

01:00:42.806 --> 01:00:47.357
What I thought was,
the light that came from him

01:00:47.895 --> 01:00:49.738
and which illuminated everything

01:00:50.105 --> 01:00:53.530
was identical to what happened to me
when I was 18

01:00:53.942 --> 01:00:56.445
and Zeus blessed me with a thunderbolt.

01:00:57.154 --> 01:01:00.249
But that is all there is.
There's just that.

01:01:01.116 --> 01:01:05.622
The smile of one's grandson,
and the blessing of the King of the Gods.

01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:07.297
And they're the same thing.

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:11.835
I can tell you that.

01:02:22.322 --> 01:02:27.795
Roger, darling, did I ever tell you
my story of escaping from Budapest?

01:02:30.372 --> 01:02:32.295
Once or twice.

01:02:33.876 --> 01:02:36.220
A civilian national security force...

01:02:43.886 --> 01:02:48.016
<i># I don't need no arms around me</i>

01:02:52.644 --> 01:02:56.740
<i># And I don't need no drugs to calm me</i>

01:03:01.653 --> 01:03:07.331
<i># I have seen the writing on the wall</i>

01:03:10.537 --> 01:03:14.883
<i># Don't think I need anything at all</i>

01:03:20.506 --> 01:03:24.386
<i># No! Don't think I'll need anything at all</i>

01:03:33.268 --> 01:03:37.193
<i>ll All in all it was all just bricks in the wall</i>

01:03:42.236 --> 01:03:46.742
<i># All in all you were all
Just bricks in the wall #</i>

01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:43.394
<i># Goodbye, cruel world</i>

01:07:44.519 --> 01:07:47.773
<i>it I'm leaving you today</i>

01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:51.572
<i># Goodbye</i>

01:07:52.486 --> 01:07:53.988
<i># Goodbye</i>

01:07:55.113 --> 01:07:56.535
<i># Goodbye</i>

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:08.544
<i># Goodbye, all you people</i>

01:08:09.377 --> 01:08:12.597
<i># There is nothing that you can say</i>

01:08:13.507 --> 01:08:18.604
<i># To make me change my mind</i>

01:08:19.763 --> 01:08:21.185
<i># Goodbye #</i>

01:08:44.830 --> 01:08:46.252
<i>Santé.</i>

01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:47.962
<i>Merci.</i>

01:08:53.046 --> 01:08:54.468
<i>Merci.</i>

01:08:57.259 --> 01:08:58.680
François.

01:09:03.473 --> 01:09:05.145
Probably doesn't matter much.

01:09:08.145 --> 01:09:09.647
I won't be long.

01:09:09.854 --> 01:09:13.951
I just needed to stop for a drink

01:09:15.402 --> 01:09:17.951
because, um, I'm on my way to Italy.

01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:20.658
I know you don't understand,
and that's okay.

01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:25.625
So, I'd like one more for the road,
and then I'm out of here.

01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:29.920
Merci.

01:09:41.595 --> 01:09:44.564
<i>So they landed at Salerno.</i>

01:09:44.764 --> 01:09:48.859
Up through the boot,
until they reached Monte Cassino.

01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:52.814
And there, they stopped.

01:09:54.399 --> 01:09:59.326
It was the Germans,
on the top of the hill, like that,

01:10:01.114 --> 01:10:03.208
and the river was through here.

01:10:04.492 --> 01:10:09.339
So they decided
that they would leave men here

01:10:09.539 --> 01:10:13.385
and they would take to the sea,
and they'd go up here,

01:10:13.585 --> 01:10:16.885
and that they would
create a bridgehead here.

01:10:18.757 --> 01:10:20.509
Just south of Rome.

01:10:22.344 --> 01:10:23.766
At Anzio.

01:10:24.930 --> 01:10:28.059
So they did, in January 1944.

01:10:28.391 --> 01:10:31.065
And my father went in,

01:10:31.353 --> 01:10:35.733
and they reinforced
the bridgehead in Anzio.

01:10:36.024 --> 01:10:38.868
And they were overrun.

01:10:40.612 --> 01:10:42.990
So this guy died.

01:10:44.699 --> 01:10:48.124
And that's why I'm going to Anzio.

01:10:49.537 --> 01:10:54.509
Because I've never seen the memorial
to my father, Eric.

01:10:56.878 --> 01:10:58.300
So, that's the story.

01:10:58.505 --> 01:11:02.555
I know you don't understand,
but I think I'll have one more, for the road.

01:11:04.719 --> 01:11:07.063
<i>Dear Roger, huh, I don't think</i>

01:11:07.264 --> 01:11:10.143
<i>I ever told you my
two escapes from Hungary.</i>

01:11:10.392 --> 01:11:14.898
The first one in 1944,
from the German occupation.

01:11:15.188 --> 01:11:16.781
I was seven years old.

01:11:16.982 --> 01:11:20.111
Our building was surrounded
by the Hungarian SS.

01:11:20.318 --> 01:11:23.993
We were having lunch,
and the maid brought the soup,

01:11:24.197 --> 01:11:28.327
and she suddenly started shouting,
"You've got to come immediately and look,

01:11:28.535 --> 01:11:32.631
"because all the Jews
are being taken out of the building."

01:11:32.831 --> 01:11:37.507
And my father said, "We have to leave
right now, without anything."

01:11:37.711 --> 01:11:40.009
And we got up, and left our apartment.

01:11:40.213 --> 01:11:44.138
And as we came down,
I saw a person run for his life,

01:11:44.342 --> 01:11:49.644
and two seconds later, two Hungarian SS
running after him with a drawn gun.

01:11:50.307 --> 01:11:53.356
My father said,
"Whatever you do, you must not look,"

01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:58.065
and opened the front door,
and at that second I heard the gunshots.

01:11:58.648 --> 01:12:01.868
And we're out in the street,
and I daren't look, but I did look,

01:12:02.068 --> 01:12:06.414
and there I saw
the first dead body of my life.

01:12:08.158 --> 01:12:10.581
We walked past this dead body
to the street corner

01:12:10.785 --> 01:12:13.959
and we managed to get away unnoticed.

01:12:14.748 --> 01:12:18.844
We hid, for the rest of the war,
next door to the Gestapo.

01:12:20.754 --> 01:12:24.679
Eventually, the war ended,
very undramatically

01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:27.428
and we went back to Budapest.

01:12:27.635 --> 01:12:30.479
And when we walked back
into the apartment,

01:12:30.764 --> 01:12:33.893
on the table were the four soup plates
in the dining room,

01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:36.819
you know, still with the soup, dry, in it.

01:12:38.396 --> 01:12:41.366
And as a child, I could not believe

01:12:41.566 --> 01:12:43.739
how this place could have survived

01:12:43.985 --> 01:12:48.035
all the destruction which happened
in Europe and in the world,

01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:51.869
but the four plates were not touched.

01:12:52.827 --> 01:12:54.625
Here I was, staring at the table,

01:12:54.829 --> 01:12:59.335
not understanding
how time stood still at that place there.

01:13:35.703 --> 01:13:40.004
<i># Hey, you, out there in the cold</i>

01:13:40.208 --> 01:13:42.131
<i># Getting lonely, getting old</i>

01:13:42.335 --> 01:13:44.008
<i># Can you feel me?</i>

01:13:46.381 --> 01:13:50.602
<i># Hey, you, standing in the aisles</i>

01:13:50.802 --> 01:13:52.850
<i>it With itchy feet and fading smiles</i>

01:13:53.054 --> 01:13:54.977
<i># Can you feel me?</i>

01:13:58.101 --> 01:14:04.859
<i># Hey, you, don't help them
To bury the light</i>

01:14:08.570 --> 01:14:13.497
<i># Don't give in without a fight</i>

01:14:20.665 --> 01:14:24.761
<i># Hey, you, out there on your own</i>

01:14:24.961 --> 01:14:26.759
<i># Sitting naked by the phone</i>

01:14:26.963 --> 01:14:28.761
<i># Would you touch me?</i>

01:14:31.342 --> 01:14:35.472
<i># Hey, you, with your ear against the wall</i>

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:37.603
<i># Waiting for someone to call out</i>

01:14:37.807 --> 01:14:39.275
<i># Would you touch me?</i>

01:14:43.146 --> 01:14:48.994
<i># Hey, you, would you help me
to carry the stone?</i>

01:14:53.239 --> 01:14:58.336
<i>It Open your heart, I'm coming home</i>

01:15:57.595 --> 01:16:00.599
<i># But it was only fantasy</i>

01:16:04.561 --> 01:16:06.188
<i># The wall was too high</i>

01:16:06.396 --> 01:16:08.990
<i># As you can see</i>

01:16:11.985 --> 01:16:13.987
<i># No matter how he tried</i>

01:16:14.195 --> 01:16:16.243
<i># He could not break free</i>

01:16:19.492 --> 01:16:22.917
<i># And the worms ate into his brain</i>

01:16:55.528 --> 01:16:59.874
<i># Hey, you, out there on the road</i>

01:17:00.074 --> 01:17:01.917
<i># Always doing what you're told</i>

01:17:02.118 --> 01:17:03.961
<i># Can you help me?</i>

01:17:06.205 --> 01:17:10.426
<i># Hey, you, out there beyond the wall</i>

01:17:10.627 --> 01:17:12.595
<i># Breaking bottles in the hall</i>

01:17:12.795 --> 01:17:14.672
<i># Can you help me?</i>

01:17:17.925 --> 01:17:24.683
<i># Hey, you, don't tell me
There's no hope at all</i>

01:17:27.935 --> 01:17:33.283
<i># Together we stand, divided we fall</i>

01:17:33.483 --> 01:17:37.613
<i># We fall, we fall, we fall... #</i>

01:17:46.287 --> 01:17:48.210
<i>Well, we got an hour of daylight left.</i>

01:17:48.414 --> 01:17:49.836
<i>We better get started.</i>

01:17:50.875 --> 01:17:52.377
<i>Is it unsafe to travel at night?</i>

01:17:52.877 --> 01:17:54.504
<i>It'll be a lot less safe to stay here.</i>

01:17:54.712 --> 01:17:56.589
<i>Your father's gonna
pick up our trail before long.</i>

01:17:56.798 --> 01:17:58.220
Can Lorka ride?

01:17:58.925 --> 01:18:00.393
<i>MAN". Yeah, I can ride.</i>

01:18:01.803 --> 01:18:03.305
<i>Lorka, time to go!</i>

01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:07.608
<i>Thank you for everything.</i>

01:18:08.768 --> 01:18:11.442
<i># Is there anybody out there?</i>

01:18:21.447 --> 01:18:23.916
<i># Is there anybody out there?</i>

01:18:32.917 --> 01:18:35.921
<i># Is there anybody out there?</i>

01:18:47.348 --> 01:18:50.352
<i># Is there anybody out there? #</i>

01:20:57.395 --> 01:21:00.820
<i># I've got a little black book
With my poems in</i>

01:21:01.774 --> 01:21:05.244
<i># Got a bag with a toothbrush
And a comb in</i>

01:21:06.529 --> 01:21:12.582
<i># When I'm a good dog,
they sometimes throw me a bone in</i>

01:21:14.662 --> 01:21:19.293
<i># I got elastic bands keepin' my shoes on</i>

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:23.755
<i># Got them swollen hand blues</i>

01:21:24.213 --> 01:21:30.687
<i># I got thirteen channels of shit
on the TV to choose from</i>

01:21:33.431 --> 01:21:35.433
<i>it I've got electric light</i>

01:21:38.686 --> 01:21:40.780
<i># And I've got second sight</i>

01:21:42.398 --> 01:21:48.656
<i># Got amazing powers of observation</i>

01:21:52.742 --> 01:21:54.164
<i># And that is how I know</i>

01:21:57.288 --> 01:21:59.507
<i># When I try to get through</i>

01:22:01.876 --> 01:22:03.970
<i># On the telephone to you</i>

01:22:08.549 --> 01:22:10.677
<i># There'll be nobody home</i>

01:22:18.559 --> 01:22:21.984
<i># I've got the obligatory Hendrix perm</i>

01:22:23.356 --> 01:22:26.781
<i>ii And the inevitable pinhole burns</i>

01:22:28.277 --> 01:22:33.534
<i># All down the front
Of my favourite satin shirt</i>

01:22:36.494 --> 01:22:40.874
<i># I've got nicotine stains on my fingers</i>

01:22:41.666 --> 01:22:45.421
<i># I've got a silver spoon on a chain</i>

01:22:46.295 --> 01:22:52.519
<i># I've got a grand piano
to prop up my mortal remains</i>

01:22:54.845 --> 01:22:58.645
<i># I've got wild staring eyes</i>

01:23:00.476 --> 01:23:03.525
<i># And I've got a strong urge to fly</i>

01:23:06.732 --> 01:23:09.702
<i># But I got nowhere to fly to</i>

01:23:18.369 --> 01:23:22.590
<i># Ooooh, babe</i>

01:23:23.374 --> 01:23:26.002
<i>it When I pick up the phone</i>

01:23:28.004 --> 01:23:30.507
<i>Surprise, surprise, surprise!</i>

01:23:30.756 --> 01:23:32.804
<i># There's still nobody home</i>

01:23:40.057 --> 01:23:43.982
<i># I've got a pair of Gohills boots</i>

01:23:44.770 --> 01:23:49.526
<i># And I got fading roots #</i>

01:23:50.484 --> 01:23:52.782
<i>Where the hell are you, Simon?</i>

01:24:13.924 --> 01:24:16.552
<i>What concerns me
is the other end of it...</i>

01:24:16.761 --> 01:24:18.684
<i>which is the attachment to dogma...</i>

01:24:18.888 --> 01:24:23.268
<i>which translates into political action,
which kills people.</i>

01:24:23.476 --> 01:24:26.355
<i>- And that's...
Well, I'm with you on that, mate.</i>

01:24:28.814 --> 01:24:30.282
<i>On the tour,</i>

01:24:30.483 --> 01:24:34.989
<i>I invite about 20 wounded veterans
to the show each night.</i>

01:24:35.529 --> 01:24:37.031
<i>There was one guy.</i>

01:24:37.406 --> 01:24:39.875
And he just nodded,
and then he put his hand out,

01:24:40.076 --> 01:24:42.750
and I grabbed his hand like that
to shake his hand,

01:24:42.953 --> 01:24:44.796
and he wouldn't let go of my hand.

01:24:45.623 --> 01:24:49.298
So I thought, "Okay, he obviously
wants to say something."

01:24:50.002 --> 01:24:53.131
And he stood there
and he looked at me straight in the eyes.

01:24:53.923 --> 01:24:56.722
Very kind of weird, piercing look.

01:24:56.926 --> 01:24:59.020
And then he said...

01:25:00.638 --> 01:25:02.982
"Your father would be proud of you."

01:25:04.683 --> 01:25:06.481
And it was a very weird moment.

01:25:06.811 --> 01:25:08.233
I just...

01:25:08.729 --> 01:25:13.610
I just sort of turned to jelly, really,

01:25:13.818 --> 01:25:15.695
and I felt myself welling up.

01:25:16.821 --> 01:25:18.789
I'll never forget him.

01:25:23.077 --> 01:25:27.423
<i># Does anybody here
Remember Vera Lynn?</i>

01:25:32.294 --> 01:25:36.049
<i># Remember how she said that</i>

01:25:36.257 --> 01:25:41.684
<i># We would meet again some sunny day?</i>

01:26:06.537 --> 01:26:08.005
<i># Vera!</i>

01:26:08.956 --> 01:26:10.378
<i># Vera!</i>

01:26:13.669 --> 01:26:16.889
<i># What has become of you?</i>

01:26:21.802 --> 01:26:24.897
<i># Does anybody else in here</i>

01:26:25.347 --> 01:26:28.226
<i># Feel the way I do? #</i>

01:26:40.863 --> 01:26:45.164
<i># Bring the boys back home</i>

01:26:49.955 --> 01:26:54.381
<i># Bring the boys back home</i>

01:26:58.797 --> 01:27:05.681
<i># Don't leave the children
on their own, no, no</i>

01:27:24.615 --> 01:27:29.246
<i># Bring the boys back home</i>

01:27:33.958 --> 01:27:39.180
<i># Bring the boys back home</i>

01:27:42.508 --> 01:27:49.312
<i># Don't leave the children
on their own, no, no</i>

01:27:54.478 --> 01:27:58.984
<i># Bring the boys back home #</i>

01:29:08.677 --> 01:29:10.930
<i># Hello?</i>

01:29:11.138 --> 01:29:13.732
<i>It ls there anybody in there?</i>

01:29:15.142 --> 01:29:17.611
<i># Just nod if you can hear me</i>

01:29:19.605 --> 01:29:22.154
<i># Is there anyone at home?</i>

01:29:23.859 --> 01:29:29.787
<i># Come on, now,
I hear you're feeling down</i>

01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:33.953
<i># Well I can ease the pain</i>

01:29:34.161 --> 01:29:37.381
<i># Get you on your feet again</i>

01:29:38.916 --> 01:29:44.764
<i># Relax. I'll need some information first</i>

01:29:46.465 --> 01:29:48.763
<i># Just the basic facts</i>

01:29:49.843 --> 01:29:52.471
<i># Can you show me where it hurts?</i>

01:29:54.681 --> 01:29:59.232
<i># There is no pain you are receding</i>

01:30:02.231 --> 01:30:06.953
<i># A distant ship, smoke on the horizon</i>

01:30:09.655 --> 01:30:14.286
<i># You are only coming through in waves</i>

01:30:16.745 --> 01:30:21.967
<i># Your lips move
but I can't hear what you're saying</i>

01:30:24.253 --> 01:30:29.510
<i># When I was a child I had a fever</i>

01:30:31.927 --> 01:30:37.184
<i># My hands felt just like two balloons</i>

01:30:39.893 --> 01:30:43.943
<i># Now I've got that feeling once again</i>

01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:48.866
<i>#1 can't explain you would not understand</i>

01:30:49.069 --> 01:30:51.993
<i># This is not how I am</i>

<i># I</i>

01:30:59.621 --> 01:31:03.000

<i># O.K. Just a little pinprick</i>

01:31:54.510 --> 01:31:58.140
<i># There'll be no more aaaaaaaaah!</i>

01:31:59.014 --> 01:32:01.517
<i># But you may feel a little sick</i>

01:32:02.726 --> 01:32:04.603
<i># Can you stand up?</i>

01:32:05.812 --> 01:32:09.157
<i># I do believe it's working, good</i>

01:32:09.650 --> 01:32:13.280
<i># That'll keep you going through the show</i>

01:32:14.446 --> 01:32:16.665
<i># Come on it's time to go</i>

01:32:18.867 --> 01:32:23.338
<i># There is no pain you are receding</i>

<i># I turned to look but it was gone</i>

01:33:08.292 --> 01:33:13.093
<i># I cannot put my finger on it now</i>

01:33:13.297 --> 01:33:15.140
