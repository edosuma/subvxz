05:15.823 --> 05:19.406
Come children. On your way to school.

05:29.860 --> 05:32.842
- Good morning mother Goose.
- Good morning.

05:34.038 --> 05:37.325
Here you are, balloons.
All colors of the rainbow.

06:09.774 --> 06:12.457
Boys! Boys!

07:09.300 --> 07:13.081
Oh these kids will be the death of me.

07:13.181 --> 07:14.174
Bo Peep.

07:14.175 --> 07:15.567
I'm coming mother.

07:16.665 --> 07:19.447
Oh you children will be the death of me.

07:19.448 --> 07:21.837
Ah, mother, do you really mean that?

07:22.436 --> 07:24.227
Of course I don't.

07:25.523 --> 07:29.499
Now you run right along
and tend to your sheep.

07:31.193 --> 07:32.682
And don't go losing them again.

07:32.683 --> 07:34.078
I won't.

07:34.475 --> 07:37.854
Come on fleecy, come
on curly, come on wooly.

07:44.125 --> 07:48.405
- How do you do my dear Mrs. Peep.
- How do you do, Mr. Barnaby?

07:48.406 --> 07:51.596
And how is your charming
daughter, Ms. Bo Peep?

07:51.597 --> 07:53.009
Very well thank you.

07:53.190 --> 07:56.470
Then, may I be permitted to pay my respects?

07:57.471 --> 08:01.347
Sorry, but she's out tending her sheep.

08:01.847 --> 08:03.235
Thank you.

08:06.527 --> 08:07.713
Thank you.

08:16.377 --> 08:18.862
Good morning my pretty little butterfly.

08:20.058 --> 08:21.944
Good morning Mr. Barnaby!

08:21.945 --> 08:27.221
I bring you a little bouquet,
A fragrant token of my deep devotion.

08:28.220 --> 08:31.103
Thank you very much Mr. Barnaby.

08:32.595 --> 08:36.374
- And now I have to leave you sir.
My my sheep...                 - Nay!

08:37.375 --> 08:39.563
I have long admired you.

08:39.565 --> 08:43.548
Deep with wonder on your
sweet and maidenly virtue.

08:43.645 --> 08:46.633
Marveled at your tender loveliness.

08:46.634 --> 08:47.627
In short...

08:48.128 --> 08:51.213
I'm asking you to become my wife.

08:51.611 --> 08:53.303
I...

08:53.304 --> 08:57.391
I'm sorry Mr. Barnaby and I hope
you won't think me ungrateful but...

08:57.392 --> 08:59.679
I'm a very rich man my dear.

08:59.680 --> 09:01.174
Please!

09:01.672 --> 09:03.362
Think carefully, child.

09:03.462 --> 09:05.950
Lest I revert to other means.

09:06.051 --> 09:08.838
That would be an ugly
way to win a pretty wife.

09:09.337 --> 09:12.524
I wouldn't marry you if you
were young, which you can't be,

09:12.525 --> 09:14.216
if you were honest, which you never were

09:14.217 --> 09:17.702
and if you were about to die tomorrow
which is too much to hope for.

09:17.703 --> 09:20.689
We shall meet again my
pretty little buttercup.

09:20.690 --> 09:24.074
And then you will sing a different tune.

09:37.013 --> 09:39.996
Fleecy, Curly!

09:44.475 --> 09:47.956
I came back to remind you that
your little financial obligation...

09:47.957 --> 09:50.447
- You mean the mortgage?
- ...is due today.

09:50.448 --> 09:53.035
Couldn't you give me just a little more time?

09:53.036 --> 09:56.621
I'm sorry. The law must take it's course.

09:56.922 --> 10:00.098
I shall be back shortly.

10:08.963 --> 10:10.549
Come boys.

10:10.849 --> 10:12.044
You'll be late for work.

10:12.045 --> 10:13.439
We're coming.

10:16.728 --> 10:19.312
- Good morning, mother Peep.
- Good morning, Ollie!

10:20.208 --> 10:22.492
Will you come on. It's almost 8 O'clock.

10:33.941 --> 10:36.324
Why, I thought I left you
upstairs in the bedroom.

10:36.325 --> 10:38.515
- You did.
- Well how'd you get down here?

10:38.613 --> 10:40.208
I fell out the window.

10:40.809 --> 10:41.999
Good morning mother Peep.

10:42.000 --> 10:42.996
God morgen Stannie.

10:42.997 --> 10:43.993
Good morning Ollie.

10:43.994 --> 10:46.382
God morgen Stan never
mind good morning.

10:46.484 --> 10:47.479
Come on and let's go!

10:48.180 --> 10:50.268
Wait a minute. I forgot something.

10:50.369 --> 10:51.761
I'll be right down.

10:53.753 --> 10:56.635
Will you come on. Do you
want us to be late for work?

10:56.636 --> 10:58.527
Don't forget your lunch, Ollie.

11:00.219 --> 11:01.707
What's the matter, mother Peep?

11:02.405 --> 11:04.398
I've got bad news for you.

11:04.399 --> 11:05.692
Bad news?!

11:06.091 --> 11:09.476
I'm afraid you two boys will have
to find some other place to live.

11:10.372 --> 11:11.862
Well what do you mean?

11:12.060 --> 11:16.242
That old stingely Barnaby holds
the mortgage against this shoe.

11:16.443 --> 11:19.430
It's due today and I haven't
got the money to pay him.

11:19.531 --> 11:22.617
And we'll all be cast out into the street.

11:23.616 --> 11:26.702
Stannie. Go upstairs and get my money box.

11:27.203 --> 11:27.999
Eh?

11:28.000 --> 11:29.688
Go get my money box.

11:31.580 --> 11:32.871
What are you going to do?

11:32.872 --> 11:35.458
I'm going to give you all of my savings.

11:35.459 --> 11:38.046
And I'll get the rest of it
from our master the toy maker.

11:38.247 --> 11:41.334
No ones going to throw
you out of this shoe.

11:41.335 --> 11:43.123
Oh I can't let you do such a thing.

11:43.298 --> 11:46.189
Tut, tut, tut, tarut!

11:46.211 --> 11:49.091
One good turn deserves another.

11:50.291 --> 11:51.782
Now smile!

11:52.974 --> 11:56.257
That's it... that's it.

12:06.812 --> 12:10.490
I owe you 1.48. Stannie Dum

12:11.788 --> 12:13.382
I borrowed it.

12:13.683 --> 12:15.375
I know you borrowed it.

12:15.376 --> 12:17.357
But what did you borrow it for?!

12:17.558 --> 12:19.849
Well you see I had to buy
some more Pee wee's.

12:19.850 --> 12:22.535
I lost three of them playing
with little Jack Horner.

12:22.536 --> 12:25.323
Had to buy some more Pee Wee's.

12:27.519 --> 12:31.694
Well don't you mind, Mother Peep
I'll get the full amount from the toy maker.

12:31.894 --> 12:34.482
Oh you boys musn't go
into debt on my account.

12:34.483 --> 12:38.567
Listen, when the toy maker finds out
that Barnaby's up to his old tricks again

12:38.568 --> 12:41.654
he'll give me the full
amount without any problem.

12:41.654 --> 12:45.929
- Oh, can I depend on that?
- Why of course you can.

12:45.930 --> 12:52.002
You know the toy maker and I are
just like that. Aren't we, Stannie?

12:52.003 --> 12:54.091
- Are you?
- Why certainly.

12:54.292 --> 12:57.677
- Which is you?
- Why this one right... never mind!

12:58.578 --> 13:00.367
- Good bye.
- Good bye.

13:02.161 --> 13:03.450
Don't forget your lunch.

13:04.050 --> 13:05.143
And don't you worry.

13:05.244 --> 13:06.738
No I won't.

13:07.236 --> 13:08.828
Good bye boys.

13:09.821 --> 13:10.861
Just a moment.

13:11.396 --> 13:15.210
What is this Pee Wee business
you've been spending all my money on?

13:15.268 --> 13:16.506
Would you like to see it?

13:16.505 --> 13:19.392
Certainly I'd like to see it.
After all the money it's cost me

13:19.393 --> 13:21.358
I think I'm entitled to
know what it's all about.

13:21.358 --> 13:22.777
Alright,... look.

13:35.567 --> 13:36.780
What do you think of that?

13:36.780 --> 13:38.054
Piffle!

13:38.089 --> 13:41.836
That's the silliest thing I have ever seen.

13:41.836 --> 13:42.691
Try it.

13:42.691 --> 13:45.849
- I don't want to try it!
- Why, can't you do it?

13:45.850 --> 13:48.725
Well certainly I can. What
do you mean, can't I do it

13:48.725 --> 13:50.248
Give me that! Get over there.

13:51.313 --> 13:56.006
It's a certainty that
anything you can do, I can do!

13:58.484 --> 14:00.047
What for instance?

14:44.253 --> 14:45.453
Here!

15:12.753 --> 15:13.880
Just a moment!

15:26.896 --> 15:28.182
Thank you!

15:40.140 --> 15:41.352
Come on, we'll be late for work.

15:41.387 --> 15:43.281
Say listen, when you
get that money from...

15:43.282 --> 15:46.570
- ...the toy maker will you borrow a little
extra for me?             - What for?

15:46.571 --> 15:48.576
Well I lost me Pee Wee and
I'll have to get some more.

15:48.577 --> 15:51.234
Get in here now, will you. Pee Wee!

16:06.758 --> 16:10.243
- Good morning, master.
- What do you mean, good morning?!

16:10.544 --> 16:12.133
You know you're half an hour late!

16:12.634 --> 16:16.116
If this happens again, it will mean
instant dismissal. Get to work!

16:29.160 --> 16:32.340
Say, aren't you gonna ask him about
the money to pay off the mortgage?

16:32.341 --> 16:36.127
I can't ask him now. Don't you
see what a bad humor he's in.

16:36.229 --> 16:39.606
Well if we don't get that money, Mother
Peep's gonna be turned out of the shoe, and

16:39.607 --> 16:41.502
she won't have any place to sleep.

16:41.503 --> 16:43.095
We can't let her do that.

16:43.096 --> 16:47.578
Why if I ask him now, he'll
jump right down my throat.

16:48.770 --> 16:51.257
But I thought you and
he were just like that.

16:51.557 --> 16:52.552
We are!

16:52.553 --> 16:53.947
Well why don't you ask him?

16:55.042 --> 16:56.632
Why don't you ask him?

16:57.330 --> 16:58.623
Well I can't ask him.

16:58.624 --> 16:59.621
Why?

16:59.622 --> 17:04.001
- Well he and I are just like that.
- Oh, don't be silly.

17:04.898 --> 17:08.087
- He likes you better than he does me.
- Does he?

17:08.088 --> 17:10.576
Yep. He told me he did!

17:10.876 --> 17:12.765
- Did he?
- Yeah!

17:13.661 --> 17:14.950
Oh master.

17:15.751 --> 17:16.247
What?

17:16.948 --> 17:18.237
Ollie wants to speak to you.

17:19.832 --> 17:21.221
Well, what is it?

17:21.922 --> 17:24.508
Well could I speak to
you privately please sir?

17:24.809 --> 17:27.592
I've got a very important
question I want to ask you.

17:27.593 --> 17:30.779
Don't bother me now! Can't you see
that I'm busy?! Go on with your work!

17:32.771 --> 17:36.554
Well if you knew how important it was,
you'd see me privately because if...

17:36.555 --> 17:39.036
Will you shut up and go on with your work!

17:49.385 --> 17:52.169
Fleecy... fleecy!

17:52.889 --> 17:56.781
Wooly... Snowball?!

19:58.295 --> 20:00.578
No, I haven't seen them!

22:31.190 --> 22:32.383
Oh, Tom Tom.

22:32.884 --> 22:35.273
I don't know what mother would
do if they were really lost.

22:35.274 --> 22:40.054
Oh, don't worry. They'll be found.
You've lost them before, haven't you?

22:40.354 --> 22:43.735
As a matter of fact, last month
you lost them five times!

22:44.135 --> 22:45.429
Oh I couldn't have.

22:45.430 --> 22:46.326
Yes you did.

22:46.327 --> 22:50.409
And four times the month before that!
You see, you're getting worse.

22:51.308 --> 22:55.188
What you need is someone to help
you look after the darn things.

22:56.489 --> 22:58.274
Who, for instance?

22:58.675 --> 23:00.964
Oh, he'd have to be most unusual.

23:01.165 --> 23:03.655
Energetic... resourceful...

23:04.055 --> 23:05.946
and with any amount of patience.

23:07.140 --> 23:11.911
A fellow sort of... well... like me!

23:15.598 --> 23:17.188
Not interested?

23:17.689 --> 23:19.077
Not even a little bit?

23:30.531 --> 23:33.508
Then I'll just keep you there
until you are interested!

23:57.800 --> 24:01.673
- Nice?... Interested?
- Uh huh.

24:35.820 --> 24:38.796
Oh look, Tom Tom, they found them!

24:43.083 --> 24:45.468
You should hang your
head you naughty sheep.

24:55.718 --> 24:57.305
My dear friends...

24:57.706 --> 24:59.697
and citizens of Toyland.

24:59.798 --> 25:01.588
I want you all to meet

25:01.688 --> 25:04.575
The future Mrs. Piper!

26:20.829 --> 26:22.615
Hello mister toy maker.

26:22.616 --> 26:25.304
Well, how's my order coming along?

26:25.305 --> 26:27.494
Everything is in fine shape.

26:27.496 --> 26:28.089
Good.

26:28.090 --> 26:30.682
- Are you coming in?
- Yes, just a moment.

26:32.400 --> 26:36.617
Alright. I won't forget you. Now run along.

26:44.608 --> 26:47.191
Hello everybody. How's everything?

26:47.392 --> 26:51.175
- And how are my two boys?
- Hello Mr. Santee.

26:52.368 --> 26:55.353
Can't wait until you see the
wooden soldiers we made for you.

26:55.354 --> 26:58.040
The finest piece of work
we've ever turned out.

26:58.041 --> 26:59.435
- Splendid!
- Yes.

26:59.436 --> 27:01.030
Ollie! Go and bring one of them in.

27:01.031 --> 27:03.120
Yes sir. You'd better help me. They're heavy.

27:03.521 --> 27:05.311
We'll have them right out, Mr. Santee.

27:07.298 --> 27:09.890
You'll get the surprise of your life!

27:15.265 --> 27:19.044
Don't try to lift it. All you have to
do is press the button in the back

27:19.244 --> 27:20.935
And it walks out by itself.

27:38.157 --> 27:39.741
Isn't it wonderful?

27:40.342 --> 27:42.630
It does everything but talk.

27:44.026 --> 27:46.812
Wonderful yes. But not what I ordered.

27:47.710 --> 27:49.003
What do you mean?

27:49.603 --> 27:53.288
I ordered 600 soldiers at one foot high.

27:53.289 --> 27:54.080
What?

28:00.352 --> 28:01.940
You took that order.

28:02.241 --> 28:03.437
What was it?

28:03.438 --> 28:06.823
I thought you said 100
soldiers at six foot high.

28:09.012 --> 28:11.050
You got the order all wrong.

28:11.101 --> 28:15.381
I couldn't give those things
to my children to play with.

28:18.171 --> 28:21.948
Put it back in the box and get
out of here. You're through!

28:26.527 --> 28:31.796
- Here's another mess you've gotten us into.
- Well I couldn't help it.

28:31.797 --> 28:35.183
If you had been watching what you were
doing, you wouldn't have gotten us into

28:35.684 --> 28:38.670
Come out of there. Not you! It's for him!

28:42.455 --> 28:45.933
Put that thing back in
the box! Get out of here!

28:54.097 --> 28:57.273
Stop it! Stop it! Do something!

29:20.366 --> 29:22.253
Come out of there!

29:22.654 --> 29:25.440
Why didn't you stop it, you blithering idiots?!

29:25.741 --> 29:28.228
- Now get out and stay out!
- Yes sir.

29:30.814 --> 29:33.302
Aren't you gonna ask him about
the money for the mortgage?

29:33.500 --> 29:34.296
What's that?!

29:35.097 --> 29:38.280
Just skip it. It's a fine time to ask for money.

29:41.568 --> 29:44.251
Oh mommy. I'm so happy!

29:44.351 --> 29:46.442
Tom Tom has asked me to become his bride.

29:46.443 --> 29:48.030
My child.

29:48.331 --> 29:50.222
And with your permission,
we'd like to be married.

29:50.223 --> 29:52.513
Why of course darling.

29:52.914 --> 29:54.603
My blessings are with you.

29:54.703 --> 29:57.691
And may nothing ever happen
to mar your happiness.

29:57.693 --> 29:59.387
Ah, thank you mother.

30:01.075 --> 30:02.164
Mr. Barnaby!

30:02.365 --> 30:05.855
When you enter my house,
I'll trouble you to knock.

30:05.856 --> 30:10.137
Your house, my good lady?
Did you say your house?

30:10.138 --> 30:11.632
Yes, my house!

30:11.633 --> 30:14.717
Not until this little debt is fulfilled.

30:14.718 --> 30:16.710
Why mother, what does it mean?

30:16.911 --> 30:18.601
It means my dear

30:18.602 --> 30:20.593
that unless this mortgage is paid

30:20.794 --> 30:23.680
You will all be thrown out into the street.

30:23.979 --> 30:25.374
Of course

30:26.268 --> 30:28.656
We could compromise.

30:28.957 --> 30:31.648
- Compromise?
- Yes.

30:31.949 --> 30:34.834
Should your daughter
reconsider my generous offer...

30:34.835 --> 30:38.716
to become my wife, we could
forget this little matter.

30:39.214 --> 30:42.105
And it could be her wedding present.

30:42.406 --> 30:43.203
Mother?!

30:43.204 --> 30:47.483
Don't worry darling nothing
like that will ever happen.

30:47.781 --> 30:50.361
Then, let us get down to business.

31:05.046 --> 31:06.534
Mr. Barnaby!

31:06.535 --> 31:07.931
You can make out your receipt.

31:08.382 --> 31:11.069
You'll be paid in full, right now!

31:15.748 --> 31:17.933
Well, here you are boys.

31:17.934 --> 31:19.329
Just in time.

31:21.916 --> 31:23.897
This wretched man seems
to think that we haven't got...

31:23.898 --> 31:25.997
the money to pay off the mortgage.

31:26.194 --> 31:28.378
But we have, haven't we!

31:28.879 --> 31:30.870
Haven't we boys!

31:33.261 --> 31:34.852
Why what's the matter?

31:35.750 --> 31:37.742
Didn't you get the money?

31:38.043 --> 31:40.032
No, you see Ollie made a mistake.

31:40.530 --> 31:41.622
A mistake?

31:41.823 --> 31:44.710
He and the toy maker are not like that.

31:44.811 --> 31:45.805
Are you!?

31:48.294 --> 31:49.687
Then I take it madam,

31:49.988 --> 31:53.567
You cannot meet your lawful obligation?

31:53.568 --> 31:56.157
In which case, I shall bid you good day.

31:56.658 --> 31:59.642
Foreclosure papers will
be served in due course.

31:59.643 --> 32:03.323
Oh, your not really going
to throw us into the street?

32:03.524 --> 32:06.715
Much as it pains me, I'm sorry.

32:14.476 --> 32:17.061
Big bait catches big rats!

32:19.251 --> 32:22.634
Oh mother, what shall I do?
what shall I do?

32:22.735 --> 32:24.922
If only he didn't have that mortgage.

32:25.520 --> 32:26.915
Don't you worry, Mother Peep

32:26.916 --> 32:30.998
Stannie and me will find a way to get
the mortgage from that old buzzard!

32:31.399 --> 32:33.188
He sure is an old buzzard.

32:33.688 --> 32:37.370
You know, if he thinks he's gonna throw
this shoe into the street, he's mistaken.

32:37.372 --> 32:38.367
He certainly is.

32:38.368 --> 32:40.856
- You know what I'd like to do.
- What?

32:40.857 --> 32:43.744
I'd like to put on this shoe
and kick him right in the pants.

32:46.531 --> 32:47.718
Then I'd kick...

32:54.098 --> 32:57.179
- What happened?
- Barnaby clunked you.

33:02.454 --> 33:04.041
Open that window.

34:17.899 --> 34:20.485
- Ollie?
- What?

34:20.484 --> 34:21.481
We're outside.

34:21.880 --> 34:22.476
Good!

34:22.476 --> 34:23.871
Now what do we do?

34:23.873 --> 34:27.456
Take me over to Barnaby's house
and be sure no one sees you.

34:27.456 --> 34:28.650
Ok.

34:30.344 --> 34:31.829
And be careful!

34:51.245 --> 34:54.925
- We're here.
- So far, so good.

34:54.926 --> 34:55.922
It wasn't so far.

34:55.922 --> 34:59.110
- We just came across the street.
- Ring the bell!

34:59.999 --> 35:02.198
It wasn't so far!

35:14.639 --> 35:15.631
Who is it?

35:16.532 --> 35:17.426
It's me.

35:17.427 --> 35:19.915
What do you want at this hour of the night?

35:20.212 --> 35:23.598
Well you see, Ollie and I are sorry
for what happened this afternoon

35:23.599 --> 35:27.878
And just to show you we're not mad at
you, we brought you a Christmas present.

35:27.979 --> 35:29.970
It's from me, and from Ollie.

35:31.463 --> 35:34.451
Christmas present, in the middle of July?

35:34.452 --> 35:37.739
Oh yes, you see we always do
our Christmas shopping early.

35:38.737 --> 35:41.122
If you'll open the door
I'll bring it right in for you.

35:41.422 --> 35:43.113
I'll be right down.

35:50.183 --> 35:52.863
- He's coming down. He's going to let us in.
- That's fine.

35:52.864 --> 35:53.957
Now don't forget

35:53.958 --> 35:55.254
when he goes to bed

35:55.255 --> 35:56.649
you give me the signal.

35:56.947 --> 36:00.832
And I'll get out of the box,
open the door and let you in.

36:00.931 --> 36:02.919
Then we'll get the mortgage.

36:04.413 --> 36:06.899
So far, so good.

36:40.727 --> 36:41.939
What is it?

36:42.139 --> 36:44.821
- I couldn't tell you.
- Couldn't tell me?

36:44.856 --> 36:46.855
No. You see it's a surprise.

36:47.090 --> 36:49.008
And it musn't be opened til Christmas.

36:49.407 --> 36:50.403
See.

36:50.604 --> 36:53.492
Do not open, until Christmas.

36:55.082 --> 36:59.063
Well, that's very nice of you.
It is, isn't it!

36:59.861 --> 37:03.839
- Well, good night Mr. Barnaby.
- Good night Mr. Dum.

37:07.526 --> 37:09.113
You can go to bed now.

37:09.211 --> 37:10.304
Thank you

37:10.705 --> 37:11.398
Mr.

37:11.399 --> 37:12.694
Dum.

37:12.994 --> 37:14.487
Merry Christmas.

37:14.688 --> 37:16.479
A merry Christmas to you.

37:18.470 --> 37:19.362
Good night.

37:19.363 --> 37:20.258
Good night!

37:20.558 --> 37:21.954
Good night Ollie!

37:22.155 --> 37:23.547
Good night Stannie!

37:58.578 --> 38:04.158
Where as Ollie Dee and Stannie Dum
have been found guilty of burglary

38:04.458 --> 38:09.334
they will be dunked and thereafter
exiled to bogey land forever!

38:13.819 --> 38:15.603
Good night Ollie!

38:18.393 --> 38:21.873
Your majesty, what are we waiting for?

38:22.368 --> 38:25.848
Oh yeah... proceed with the dunking!

38:35.409 --> 38:36.601
Come on!

38:37.294 --> 38:39.876
Your first. Come on!

38:41.273 --> 38:44.255
- Ollie!            - What?
- Here.

38:45.947 --> 38:49.327
You better give me your watch.
I'll hold it for you until you come out.

38:52.019 --> 38:56.597
Thanks. Now take good care of it because
I wouldn't have anything happen to that.

38:56.898 --> 38:58.388
- I will.
- Good bye.

38:58.389 --> 38:59.785
Good bye.

38:59.886 --> 39:01.178
- Come on!
- All right.

39:03.865 --> 39:05.646
Splendid!

39:24.864 --> 39:26.951
- Is it cold?
- Yes!

39:35.813 --> 39:37.104
I'm smothering!

39:37.301 --> 39:40.087
- Keep your nose closed!
- I will!

40:03.583 --> 40:05.972
Hurry. He'll die of ammonia!

40:08.855 --> 40:10.346
This is terrible.

40:16.920 --> 40:18.800
Hold your nose, Ollie!

40:44.789 --> 40:46.472
Bring him up, bring him up.

40:55.631 --> 40:56.822
How do you feel?

40:57.220 --> 40:58.914
You know how I feel!

41:01.104 --> 41:03.386
Here, have a drink of
water. That'll do you good.

41:03.387 --> 41:04.186
Thank you.

41:06.078 --> 41:09.957
- Haven't I had enough water?!
- I was only trying to help.

41:11.254 --> 41:14.331
Mr. Barnaby. Can't something
be done to stop this?

41:14.332 --> 41:17.525
Why yes. Consent to become my wife.

41:17.926 --> 41:19.415
And they will go free.

41:23.003 --> 41:24.786
All right, Mr. Barnaby.

41:25.287 --> 41:27.077
I consent.

41:28.968 --> 41:33.447
With your majesty's permission,
I wish to withdraw my charges.

41:33.548 --> 41:35.240
Withdrawn they shall be.

41:36.735 --> 41:38.719
Residents of Toyland,

41:39.020 --> 41:40.811
I want you all to meet...

41:41.212 --> 41:44.996
The future Mrs. Silas Barnaby.

41:47.982 --> 41:48.974
You may go.

41:49.275 --> 41:50.270
Thank you sir.

41:50.271 --> 41:52.162
- Does that mean we're free?
- Yes.

41:52.659 --> 41:57.434
And from now on, you and I are
going to be very close friends.

41:58.327 --> 42:01.210
- Does that mean that he won't be dunked!?
- Yes!

42:02.407 --> 42:04.395
- Isn't that nice?
- What?

42:04.794 --> 42:06.785
He and I are just like that.

42:06.986 --> 42:10.070
- And I don't have to get wet.
- Oh, is that so!

42:19.927 --> 42:21.614
- Ollie!
- What?

42:21.915 --> 42:23.310
Here's your watch.

42:31.571 --> 42:37.737
Run over and tell the bride that all is
in readyness and her lover is waiting.

42:46.691 --> 42:49.479
Mumsy, what did Tom Tom say?

42:50.177 --> 42:51.366
He understands.

42:52.161 --> 42:57.242
Now you see. If you hadn't said good
night Ollie, this wouldn't have happened.

43:00.333 --> 43:01.819
Where are you going Mother Peep?

43:02.020 --> 43:05.106
I'm going over to Barnaby
to make a final plea.

43:05.107 --> 43:10.183
Surely there must be one spark of
kindness in that phony heart of his.

43:10.183 --> 43:14.561
That's a good ideia. But I
don't think it will do any good.

43:18.441 --> 43:22.519
You're right Ollie.
You can't turn blood into a stone.

43:23.416 --> 43:24.806
What do you mean?

43:25.304 --> 43:26.000
What do you mean?

43:26.501 --> 43:28.288
Well her talking to Barnaby,

43:28.589 --> 43:33.570
is just a matter of pouring one ear into
another and coming out the other side.

43:34.265 --> 43:36.154
It can't be done.

43:37.448 --> 43:40.633
I'm sorry Bo Peep that you had
to choose me for the best man.

43:41.232 --> 43:45.414
Why I'd rather do anything in this
world than to have to give you away.

43:46.707 --> 43:50.686
Why Stannie is so upset, he's
not even going to the wedding.

43:51.681 --> 43:57.053
- You are upset, aren't you!
- Upset?! I'm house broken.

43:58.949 --> 44:00.932
Not house broken.

44:01.833 --> 44:04.420
He means heart broken.

44:05.811 --> 44:07.999
House broken huh!

44:10.519 --> 44:12.111
Come in.

44:15.667 --> 44:20.277
Mr. Barnaby. Don't force my
daughter into this dreadful marriage.

44:20.277 --> 44:24.319
I'm an old woman. Pleading
for her daughter's happiness.

44:26.515 --> 44:31.582
Oh don't do this dreadful thing.
Mr. Barnaby. I'll do anything you ask!

44:31.583 --> 44:34.074
Work for you. Slave for you.

44:34.574 --> 44:38.759
Only don't, please don't.

44:40.546 --> 44:42.333
Woman, you're a fool!

44:42.634 --> 44:45.819
The bargains made, and you'll abide by it.

44:46.614 --> 44:49.596
Master, the bride is here!

45:03.020 --> 45:05.412
Welcome to Barnaby Hall.

45:08.699 --> 45:10.283
Shut that door!

45:14.073 --> 45:17.753
- Come, come judge. Let's waste no time.
- Have you the ring?

45:19.645 --> 45:22.133
Your name is Silas Barnaby?

45:22.334 --> 45:23.327
It is.

45:23.928 --> 45:27.509
- And your name is Little Bo Peep?
- It is.

45:28.106 --> 45:31.090
Do you take this woman for
you lawfully wedded wife?

45:31.190 --> 45:32.287
I do.

45:32.980 --> 45:36.768
And do you take this man for
your lawfully wedded husband?

45:36.864 --> 45:38.352
I do.

45:43.532 --> 45:47.907
I now pronounce you man and wife.

45:50.496 --> 45:52.786
And now, to kiss the bride.

45:52.887 --> 45:54.280
Just a moment.

45:54.877 --> 45:57.162
Haven't you forgotten something, Mr. Barnaby?

45:57.163 --> 46:00.045
Oh yes. The mortgage.

46:00.843 --> 46:03.324
My wedding present.

46:14.871 --> 46:17.555
Now, you may kiss the bride.

46:25.626 --> 46:27.910
What is the meaning of this?!

46:27.911 --> 46:30.798
Big bait, catches big rats!

46:33.389 --> 46:35.873
The king shall hear of this!

46:54.287 --> 46:55.377
Tom Tom.

46:57.469 --> 46:59.050
Oh my boys!

47:08.515 --> 47:11.997
- That sure was a good ideia of yours.
- It certainly was!

47:11.998 --> 47:14.192
Well... good bye!

47:14.693 --> 47:15.884
And good luck.

47:16.280 --> 47:18.367
What do you mean, good bye?

47:18.768 --> 47:20.859
- Aren't I going with you?
- Why no.

47:21.160 --> 47:23.347
You have to stay here with Barnaby.

47:23.348 --> 47:24.742
Your married to him.

47:32.840 --> 47:34.994
I don't want to stay here with him.

47:35.295 --> 47:36.290
Why?

47:36.590 --> 47:38.281
I don't love him!

47:49.231 --> 47:52.813
Well don't worry. Old Barnaby
will never bother us again.

47:53.607 --> 47:57.586
- Because I'm going to take you away.
- Where?

49:29.764 --> 49:34.039
Tricked! Cheated! Laughed at in the streets!

49:35.540 --> 49:36.832
Fools!

49:37.728 --> 49:40.811
So they think they can outwit old Barnaby, eh.

49:43.099 --> 49:44.688
I'll show them.

49:46.181 --> 49:48.564
There must be a way.

49:50.258 --> 49:52.942
There must be some way!

49:56.026 --> 49:59.506
Idiot! Dolt! Imbecile! Pig!

50:02.831 --> 50:04.519
Pig!

50:05.713 --> 50:10.990
Get me a nice red juicy apple.
I'll steal one of the three little pigs.

50:11.289 --> 50:14.668
And the evidence will be
placed in Tom Tom's house.

50:15.266 --> 50:18.054
You know the penalty for pig-napping?

50:18.653 --> 50:20.937
Banishment to Bogeyland!

51:31.319 --> 51:32.806
Sit still!

51:35.297 --> 51:38.079
Take this evidence and
place it in Tom Tom's house.

51:41.665 --> 51:44.150
Master. Why the sausage?

51:44.151 --> 51:50.321
That will prove that he not only stole the pig,
but that he also ground him into sausage.

51:53.108 --> 51:55.393
And now little Elmer

51:56.592 --> 51:57.984
We shall see.

52:15.889 --> 52:21.159
Whereas Tom-Tom Piper has
been found guilty of pignapping

52:21.163 --> 52:25.039
He will be immediately
banished to Bogeyland.

52:27.333 --> 52:28.819
Poor Tom Tom.

52:29.718 --> 52:32.705
I'm sure glad we didn't
have to go to Bogeyland.

52:32.905 --> 52:34.193
So am I.

52:34.691 --> 52:36.585
What happens to you in Bogeyland?

52:37.186 --> 52:41.864
Oh it's a terrible place. Once you
go there, you never come back.

52:42.260 --> 52:43.449
Why?

52:43.951 --> 52:48.527
Well, when the Bogeyman
gets you, they eat you alive!

52:49.823 --> 52:51.414
What do they look like?

52:51.711 --> 52:55.991
Well I've heard that they're
half man, and half animal.

52:57.184 --> 53:01.762
With great big ears, and great big mouths.

53:02.059 --> 53:04.644
And hair all over their body.

53:05.240 --> 53:09.223
And long claws, that they catch you with.

53:13.106 --> 53:14.693
Scat! Go on!

53:15.793 --> 53:20.570
Tom my boy, you knew the penalty
for pinapping. Why did you do it?

53:20.571 --> 53:21.767
But I didn't do it!

53:21.768 --> 53:24.156
I don't even know what you're talking about.

53:24.157 --> 53:29.334
How can you say that, in view of
this evidence, found in your house.

53:30.531 --> 53:32.017
Take it away.

53:33.813 --> 53:36.602
Your majesty. You made a horrible mistake.

53:36.803 --> 53:39.092
Tom Tom knows nothing about this.

53:39.093 --> 53:41.676
He's been with me all day. Hasn't he mommy!

53:41.677 --> 53:43.465
That's right your majesty.

53:43.566 --> 53:46.453
Why not let the law take
it's course, your majesty?!

53:57.404 --> 53:59.790
Watch that until I come back!

54:25.074 --> 54:26.263
What does that mean?

54:27.064 --> 54:28.956
Exhibit B.

54:29.156 --> 54:32.539
That means that the pig
sausage, is part of the evidence.

54:34.731 --> 54:37.312
Doesn't taste like pig sausage to me!

54:37.813 --> 54:39.206
What does it taste like?

54:40.305 --> 54:42.493
Tastes like pork.

54:44.981 --> 54:46.260
Try it.

54:53.840 --> 54:55.927
Why that's neither pig nor pork!

54:56.028 --> 54:58.515
- It's beef!
- Beef?!

54:59.311 --> 55:01.694
I smell a rat!

55:06.176 --> 55:08.361
Barnaby's got a hand in that.

55:11.645 --> 55:14.527
I believe that little Elmer is still alive!

55:15.928 --> 55:17.222
Come on, we'll find out!

55:17.223 --> 55:20.210
You've got to listen to me your
majesty, you've got to hear me.

55:20.606 --> 55:22.990
Tom Tom knows nothing about this.

55:23.791 --> 55:27.174
The little pigs are friends of ours.
Why should he want to hurt them?

55:27.975 --> 55:31.261
The violin and hat were in
the house when we got home.

55:31.758 --> 55:34.637
He's innocent, I tell you, innocent!

55:36.730 --> 55:41.109
It is with deep regret that I have
to enforce the law of our kingdom.

55:41.210 --> 55:42.604
Take him away!

55:50.465 --> 55:53.446
I tell you I'm innocent! I tell you I'm innocent!

55:53.447 --> 55:54.839
I didn't steal the pig!

55:56.947 --> 55:59.339
Tom Tom, Tom Tom

56:36.854 --> 56:42.723
You see child, it was folly, wasting
your affections on a common pignapper.

56:42.724 --> 56:44.409
Let me go! Let me go!

56:44.410 --> 56:46.501
Tom Tom is innocent and you know it!

56:46.502 --> 56:49.395
I hate you! I hate you! I hate you!

56:50.487 --> 56:52.770
Just a minute! Just a minute!

56:55.359 --> 56:56.650
Silence!

56:57.348 --> 57:03.718
Mr. Majesty. Tom Tom is innocent!
We found little Elmer in Barnaby's cellar!

57:03.719 --> 57:05.398
Let's get him!

57:19.643 --> 57:23.622
I'll give 50,000 Guineaus for the
capture of Barnaby dead or alive!

57:23.623 --> 57:26.503
- Dead or alive?!
- Dead or alive!

57:26.504 --> 57:29.087
Can't you make up your
mind which way you want him?

57:30.986 --> 57:32.373
Take me to my tower.

57:39.942 --> 57:42.624
Let's go around the back way. We'll get him!

57:49.893 --> 57:54.167
Alright Mr. Barnaby. There's no use
hiding! We know where you are!

57:55.859 --> 57:59.840
You better come out, because if you don't
we're gonna stay right here until you do.

58:00.239 --> 58:02.523
Even if it takes all night!

58:03.321 --> 58:05.408
Are we gonna stay here all night?

58:05.409 --> 58:08.991
No! We're gonna make him think we are.

58:15.662 --> 58:17.242
Tom Tom!

58:25.510 --> 58:27.495
- Tom Tom!
- Bo Peep!

58:28.796 --> 58:31.782
Stan and Ollie found little Elmer, alive!

58:31.783 --> 58:32.779
Where?

58:32.780 --> 58:34.174
In Barnaby's cellar.

58:34.270 --> 58:39.447
I knew he had something to do with this!
Oh if I ever get my hands on him.

58:40.641 --> 58:42.825
Come on. We'll find our way out of here.

58:47.803 --> 58:50.588
Oh Tom Tom, we'll never
find our way out of here!

58:50.689 --> 58:53.776
Oh yes we will. Come on!

01:01:53.346 --> 01:01:55.633
- Did he come up?
- No!

01:01:56.934 --> 01:01:58.525
Are you coming up?

01:01:58.822 --> 01:02:00.908
You better come up, dead or alive!

01:02:01.309 --> 01:02:04.495
How can he come up dead when he's alive?

01:02:05.792 --> 01:02:10.069
Let's drop a rock on him, then
we'll make him dead when he's alive.

01:02:10.070 --> 01:02:12.056
Now your talking sense.

01:02:16.437 --> 01:02:19.024
- Look out!
- Don't tell him to look out!

01:02:19.025 --> 01:02:21.315
- It might have hit him.
- That's what I wanted to do!

01:02:21.316 --> 01:02:22.511
Did it hit you?

01:02:24.404 --> 01:02:27.385
- Not a sound.
- It must have got him.

01:02:27.386 --> 01:02:28.681
Go down and bring him up.

01:02:29.281 --> 01:02:31.171
You go down and bring him up.

01:02:31.771 --> 01:02:37.642
Do you mean to tell me that you're going to
let 50,000 Guineas slip right thru your fingers?

01:02:37.643 --> 01:02:39.231
Well I'm scared!

01:02:39.232 --> 01:02:43.410
There's nothing to be afraid of.
You and he are just like that!

01:02:43.710 --> 01:02:46.191
Well that was before we were married.

01:02:47.788 --> 01:02:52.069
All right. I'll compromise. We'll both go down.

01:02:52.570 --> 01:02:53.462
That's better.

01:02:53.463 --> 01:02:54.458
Go ahead.

01:03:05.011 --> 01:03:07.694
Wait a minute go ahead!

01:03:57.042 --> 01:04:03.521
I'll teach you... I'll teach you
to trifle with Barnaby Silas!

01:04:48.727 --> 01:04:50.416
- You know what?
- What?

01:04:50.417 --> 01:04:51.414
He's not here.

01:04:51.815 --> 01:04:53.804
I can see he's not here!

01:04:54.205 --> 01:04:58.681
- Oh look! Maybe he went through this way.
- I'll bet he did. Let's go see.

01:05:20.383 --> 01:05:21.773
I wonder where he went?

01:05:21.774 --> 01:05:25.356
We'll soon find out. Let's go that way.

01:06:01.890 --> 01:06:03.179
There he is!

01:06:10.745 --> 01:06:13.228
Mr. Barnaby! You're going back with us

01:06:14.825 --> 01:06:16.406
Oh the Bogeymen!

01:06:55.137 --> 01:06:57.820
I can't get help! help!

01:07:10.750 --> 01:07:12.352
They've escaped me.

01:07:12.653 --> 01:07:16.558
But I'll get them if I have
to destroy all of Toyland!

01:07:16.659 --> 01:07:18.051
To the rafts!

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:47.683
Stand back! Here comes the king.

01:07:49.579 --> 01:07:52.761
Why all the commotion? Have you
no reverence for my beauty sleep?!

01:07:52.762 --> 01:07:55.578
Sorry your majesty, but we
were celebrating the rescue...

01:07:55.579 --> 01:07:57.740
of Tom Tom and Bo Peep, from Bogeyland.

01:07:58.741 --> 01:08:02.024
Splendid news! And who had
the courage to do this?

01:08:02.025 --> 01:08:03.217
They did, sir.

01:08:05.409 --> 01:08:06.599
Did you get Barnaby?

01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:10.883
No sir! He was running so
fast, we couldn't catch him.

01:08:11.077 --> 01:08:14.264
- He was scared to death, wasn't he?
- He sure was!

01:08:14.363 --> 01:08:15.659
Well tell me all about it.

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:34.072
Stannie and me chased Barnaby and the
Bogeyman so far, they'll never come back!

01:08:41.538 --> 01:08:46.506
- What do these Bogeyman look like?
- Oh they're terrible looking things!

01:08:46.858 --> 01:08:49.395
They're half man and half animal!

01:08:50.492 --> 01:08:52.978
With great big ears,

01:08:54.572 --> 01:08:56.758
great big mouths,

01:08:57.259 --> 01:08:59.548
and long claws,

01:09:05.917 --> 01:09:08.425
- Come back!
- You don't have to run away!

01:09:08.426 --> 01:09:11.215
- Nothing to be afraid of!
- You're not scared now!

01:09:12.883 --> 01:09:14.674
They're not half as bad as they look!

01:09:15.075 --> 01:09:16.469
There they are!

01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:19.451
Follow me!

01:09:35.975 --> 01:09:37.662
Break in the door!

01:10:29.129 --> 01:10:30.519
- Here!
- What are you going to do?

01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:32.909
We'll fix those Bogeymen! Come on!

01:10:39.877 --> 01:10:40.856
Come on, now!

01:12:35.952 --> 01:12:36.979
- Say, you know what!
- What?

01:12:36.979 --> 01:12:40.050
- Let's load them in the cannon!
- Fine!

01:13:23.323 --> 01:13:25.210
Get some more darts!

01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:34.068
- You know what!
- What?

01:13:34.069 --> 01:13:35.461
The wooden soldiers!

01:16:46.329 --> 01:16:49.782
Let's get the cannon and
give them a parting shot!
