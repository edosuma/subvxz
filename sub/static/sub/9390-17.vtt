WEBVTT

00:10.483 --> 00:13.385
Hurry up. We still have to swing
by Wyndham's before they close.

00:13.452 --> 00:14.653
Relax. I'm almost done.

00:14.721 --> 00:16.805
And why do you have
a safety deposit box anyway?

00:16.873 --> 00:18.907
What's in there that you
can't bury in the yard?

00:18.974 --> 00:20.458
I have things.

00:20.526 --> 00:21.994
You have a dead bird in there?

00:22.061 --> 00:23.678
What are you
gonna do with that?

00:23.746 --> 00:26.047
I was gonna take it home, show it
to Lois, make her proud of me.

00:26.115 --> 00:27.732
Hey, I'm starving. You
want to grab a late lunch?

00:27.800 --> 00:30.485
Can't. I'm Jenny Craig-ing.
Already paid for the meals.

00:30.553 --> 00:31.920
And if I want to
return this sweater,

00:31.987 --> 00:33.747
we've got to get
to Wyndham's by half 6:00.

00:33.789 --> 00:35.273
Half 6:00?

00:35.341 --> 00:37.442
Yes. You have to return it
within a fortnight for a refund.

00:37.510 --> 00:40.145
I love it, but I feel
like it was too much.

00:40.212 --> 00:43.648
Cute, right? It's Thom Browne.
It was over $3,000.

00:43.650 --> 00:45.934
You spent $3,000 on a sweater?

00:46.001 --> 00:47.636
What's it to you?

00:47.703 --> 00:49.504
That's the most idiotic thing I've ever heard.
You're a moron.

00:49.506 --> 00:50.839
A pretentious moron.

00:50.906 --> 00:52.624
Drop dead.
I was returning it anyway.

00:52.692 --> 00:53.992
Where'd you even get
that kind of money?

00:54.060 --> 00:56.161
None of your damn
business, that's where.

00:56.228 --> 00:58.463
You know, today started
as a really nice outing,

00:58.531 --> 00:59.892
but as usual,
you had to ruin it.

00:59.932 --> 01:01.166
I had to ruin it?

01:01.168 --> 01:03.718
Yeah, you. I was
actually hoping

01:03.786 --> 01:05.587
that you'd talk me out
of returning the sweater.

01:05.655 --> 01:07.873
So, you're right,
I guess I am a moron.

01:07.940 --> 01:10.775
You know, it's the one time
I ever splurged on myself,

01:10.843 --> 01:12.677
and you have to go
and make me feel foolish.

01:12.745 --> 01:14.079
Look, I didn't...
Save it, okay?

01:14.147 --> 01:16.848
I'll be waiting outside
under the porte cochere.

01:16.916 --> 01:20.035
It was my own fault for thinking
I could have pretty things.

01:20.103 --> 01:22.463
I'm not having fun anymore.
I feel you should know that.

01:23.856 --> 01:24.957
(LOCK CLICKING)

01:25.258 --> 01:26.298
What was that?

01:26.592 --> 01:28.393
(GRUNTING)

01:28.395 --> 01:32.764
I don't believe this. Hello?
Hello, we're locked in!

01:34.300 --> 01:35.333
(SNIFFING)

01:35.402 --> 01:38.136
Did you just crap your diaper?

01:38.204 --> 01:41.290
I got scared when
the door closed.

01:44.033 --> 01:49.304
Hey! Hello! Hello, somebody!
We're trapped in here!

01:49.305 --> 01:50.506
You're wasting your breath.

01:50.639 --> 01:53.275
These bank vault doors close
automatically at the end of the workday.

01:53.343 --> 01:54.809
This thing won't be open
again till tomorrow.

01:54.877 --> 01:56.811
Well, there's got to be some
way out of here. Think!

01:56.879 --> 01:58.146
I don't know.
You think of something.

01:58.214 --> 01:59.614
Well, I have no idea!

01:59.682 --> 02:01.516
So, you invented
a time machine,

02:01.584 --> 02:02.818
but you can't get us
out of a safe?

02:03.105 --> 02:05.206
I'm uncomfortable.
You have to change me.

02:05.273 --> 02:07.558
I'm not changing you. We
don't even have any diapers.

02:07.626 --> 02:10.445
Oh, my God, that smell is
making me sick. (GROANS)

02:10.513 --> 02:12.146
Oh, thank you for making me
more self-conscious.

02:12.214 --> 02:14.499
I'm not gonna be able to stay like
this until tomorrow, you know.

02:14.567 --> 02:17.101
Well, I don't know what you
expect me to do about it.

02:17.169 --> 02:19.103
You don't?
No, I don't.

02:20.372 --> 02:21.855
Stop looking at me like that.

02:21.923 --> 02:24.558
Look, I'm going to
propose something,

02:24.626 --> 02:26.261
and I need you to hear me out.

02:26.328 --> 02:27.945
Will you promise me
you'll do that?

02:28.013 --> 02:29.180
I guess.

02:29.279 --> 02:33.049
Okay, well, I can't be in a soiled
diaper until tomorrow, Brian,

02:33.117 --> 02:34.157
we both know that.

02:34.217 --> 02:35.518
I'll get a rash,
which could lead

02:35.585 --> 02:37.465
to an infection
if left like this.

02:37.521 --> 02:39.738
All right, fine,
I'll take the diaper off.

02:39.806 --> 02:42.841
That doesn't really solve
our problem, now, does it?

02:42.909 --> 02:43.809
Yes, it does.

02:43.877 --> 02:46.245
No, it doesn't though, really.

02:46.313 --> 02:49.382
See, you're not really
thinking this through.

02:49.450 --> 02:52.818
We would still be faced with the
problem of the odor, you see.

02:52.886 --> 02:56.355
And, of course, then what am
I gonna do with no diaper?

02:56.423 --> 02:59.258
I'm not gonna walk around here
with my Tic Tac hanging out.

02:59.326 --> 03:00.626
I need a clean diaper.

03:00.694 --> 03:02.478
I told you, we don't
have any clean diapers.

03:02.546 --> 03:05.047
Well, no, not right now
we don't, no.

03:05.115 --> 03:08.117
But if the poo
were to be removed...

03:09.019 --> 03:10.586
I'm not following you.

03:10.654 --> 03:14.540
If the poo were
to be removed...

03:14.608 --> 03:16.728
What does that...
What are you driving at?

03:17.377 --> 03:18.711
Eat it.
What?

03:18.779 --> 03:19.895
Eat it Brian.

03:19.910 --> 03:21.228
You're out of
your fucking mind.

03:21.296 --> 03:22.862
Now, you promised
you'd hear me out.

03:22.930 --> 03:24.764
Besides, is it really
that big a deal?

03:24.785 --> 03:26.986
And, you know, I've seen
you eat poop before, Brian.

03:27.054 --> 03:28.054
Yeah, mine!

03:28.121 --> 03:29.589
Is that really
a huge distinction?

03:29.657 --> 03:30.956
It is to me!

03:31.024 --> 03:34.026
I can't even... How would...
That's sick! That is sick!

03:34.094 --> 03:36.375
How messed up in the head are
you that you would even ask?

03:36.430 --> 03:38.231
Look, okay, okay,
just calm down, okay?

03:38.299 --> 03:39.765
We're not...
We're just talking.

03:39.833 --> 03:41.301
We're not doing anything yet.

03:41.368 --> 03:43.769
All right, we're just talking.
Nobody's doing anything at this point.

03:43.837 --> 03:47.774
Dogs sometimes eat feces. It's not
a judgment, it's just a fact.

03:47.776 --> 03:51.978
So what I would need you to do
is eat what's in my diaper,

03:52.046 --> 03:53.247
lick the diaper clean,

03:53.299 --> 03:54.667
and then put
the diaper back on me.

03:54.738 --> 03:56.805
There is no way any
of that is happening.

03:56.873 --> 03:58.423
Well, I don't see
a way around it, do you?

03:58.491 --> 03:59.974
I would shoot myself first.

04:00.042 --> 04:02.442
Well, how you gonna shoot yourself?
There's no gun in here.

04:05.148 --> 04:08.116
There's a gun in your safety
deposit box, isn't there?

04:11.905 --> 04:13.722
(BOTH GRUNTING)

04:17.210 --> 04:18.360
(GUN COCKING)

04:18.428 --> 04:20.496
Stewie, come on. You don't
know how to use that thing.

04:20.498 --> 04:23.139
Oh, really? What if I hold it
sideways like a black guy?

04:23.149 --> 04:25.834
Come on, man. Take it easy, all right?
I don't want any trouble.

04:25.901 --> 04:28.520
There's not gonna be any trouble
as long as you eat my poo.

04:28.587 --> 04:29.654
That's not happening.

04:29.722 --> 04:31.089
Well, then I'll be
forced to shoot you.

04:31.156 --> 04:32.223
Go ahead. There aren't
any bullets in that gun.

04:32.291 --> 04:33.525
I don't believe you.
Then shoot me.

04:33.593 --> 04:34.642
I will.
Do it.

04:34.710 --> 04:35.894
I will! Then do it! What
are you waiting for?

04:35.962 --> 04:38.162
Go on! I will! I'll blow
your fucking head off!

04:38.230 --> 04:40.482
Wait a minute. Don't you have
your cell phone with you?

04:40.767 --> 04:42.167
(EXCLAIMS) You're right!

04:42.235 --> 04:43.234
(BEEPING)

04:43.302 --> 04:44.837
Oh, no, low battery.

04:44.904 --> 04:47.224
I have to make this call count.

04:47.674 --> 04:49.441
Hurry up.
It's ringing.

04:49.508 --> 04:50.675
Oh, thank God.

04:50.743 --> 04:52.260
Come on, come on.

04:52.328 --> 04:54.663
Yes, hi. Can you connect me to
men's designer wear, please?

04:54.731 --> 04:55.891
Thank you.
What are you doing?

04:55.898 --> 04:58.133
This will just take a second.
Give me that!

04:58.201 --> 05:01.453
Hi, this is Stewie Griffin.
Who am I talking to?

05:01.521 --> 05:03.588
Hi, Matthew.
I think you're the salesman

05:03.656 --> 05:07.343
who helped me pick out a Thom
Browne sweater two weeks ago.

05:07.410 --> 05:09.995
Yes, I was going to see <i>The
Bounty Hunter that night.</i>

05:10.063 --> 05:12.583
Well, I enjoyed it very much. Thank you.
Good memory, my word.

05:12.632 --> 05:14.666
Anyway, it doesn't
fit properly and...

05:14.911 --> 05:17.511
Hey! Sorry, he's gonna
have to call you back...

05:17.831 --> 05:19.298
It's dead.

05:19.365 --> 05:22.284
You wasted the one phone call
we had to return a sweater?

05:22.352 --> 05:25.621
A $3,000 sweater,
which I am now stuck with.

05:25.689 --> 05:26.789
Oh, this day.

05:27.091 --> 05:28.858
(EXCLAIMS IN PAIN)

05:28.925 --> 05:31.693
You stink! And now I'm trapped
in here with you and your stink

05:31.762 --> 05:34.562
because you were too stupid to
call somebody who could help us!

05:34.664 --> 05:36.132
That really hurt.

05:36.200 --> 05:38.251
Just get away from me!
I can't even look at you!

05:38.318 --> 05:40.136
Well, I'm sorry.
Don't be mad.

05:40.303 --> 05:41.337
Don't!

05:49.146 --> 05:50.612
(SNIFFLING)

05:57.970 --> 05:59.137
(EXHALES)

06:00.657 --> 06:01.757
All right, I'll do it.

06:01.825 --> 06:03.158
What are you talking about?

06:03.226 --> 06:04.744
(EXHALES)

06:04.811 --> 06:06.178
I can't leave you like this.

06:06.246 --> 06:08.848
But you have to swear
never to tell anybody.

06:08.915 --> 06:10.549
(GASPS) You mean,
you're gonna eat my...

06:10.617 --> 06:13.285
Yeah, no, no, I won't
tell anybody. I swear!

06:13.353 --> 06:15.153
Okay, how should we do it?

06:15.222 --> 06:17.289
I guess it's
dealer's choice, really.

06:17.357 --> 06:21.193
I suppose the easiest way would be to
use the diaper as a bowl of sorts.

06:21.258 --> 06:23.092
All right, well, we should
get your overalls off first.

06:23.160 --> 06:25.061
I know how to do the snaps.

06:26.964 --> 06:28.314
There. I did it.

06:28.381 --> 06:30.232
Okay, good. Now let's
get your feet out.

06:30.300 --> 06:31.333
(CHUCKLING)

06:31.401 --> 06:33.036
I can't believe
we're doing this.

06:33.103 --> 06:34.671
Oh, really smells bad,
doesn't it?

06:34.738 --> 06:37.019
Yeah. You sure you
can't stay like this?

06:37.040 --> 06:38.874
I'm getting a rash, Brian.
I can feel it.

06:38.876 --> 06:40.977
Okay, okay, I can do this.

06:41.045 --> 06:42.166
All right, lay down.

06:43.496 --> 06:45.498
It's so amazing to me
that you know how to do that.

06:45.566 --> 06:47.046
It's like watching
someone do algebra.

06:47.101 --> 06:49.181
I just have no conception
of how it's done.

06:50.438 --> 06:52.188
Oh, God!

06:52.256 --> 06:53.456
(COUGHING)

06:53.524 --> 06:54.724
Okay, you ready?

06:59.229 --> 07:00.763
Okay.

07:00.831 --> 07:03.116
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

07:03.184 --> 07:05.284
(EXCLAIMS) Don't do it right here!
I don't want to watch!

07:05.352 --> 07:07.053
What? Take it over there.
Do it in the corner.

07:07.121 --> 07:08.588
It's gross!
It's your poop!

07:08.656 --> 07:13.059
Yeah, but it's your activity, you know?
It's your thing.

07:32.293 --> 07:33.276
It's done.

07:35.179 --> 07:36.913
Got some dessert for you.

07:36.980 --> 07:38.315
You gotta be kidding me.

07:38.382 --> 07:41.685
Come on. It's throw-up.
You like throw-up.

07:41.752 --> 07:43.753
I do.
I do like throw-up.

07:46.373 --> 07:48.925
All right, now let's get
this diaper back on you.

07:53.029 --> 07:55.296
Oh, wait. I can do this part.

08:01.588 --> 08:04.456
So, yeah. Thanks.

08:06.425 --> 08:08.560
I feel a lot better now.

08:08.628 --> 08:09.661
(SNIFFING)

08:09.729 --> 08:11.196
Smell's gone.

08:12.850 --> 08:15.585
You know, I think I missed my nap today.
I'm sleepy.

08:15.653 --> 08:16.813
Well, why don't you lie down?

08:16.821 --> 08:17.854
I think I will.

08:19.089 --> 08:20.290
(SIGHS)

08:22.193 --> 08:23.960
Brian?
What?

08:24.028 --> 08:25.529
I just realized something.

08:25.596 --> 08:26.729
What?

08:26.797 --> 08:28.298
Tomorrow's Sunday.

08:28.366 --> 08:29.366
Fuck.

08:38.293 --> 08:39.709
(SNORING)

good a time as any.

09:02.533 --> 09:04.618
What you doing?
Oh. Hey.

09:04.685 --> 09:06.653
Just needed a little drink.

09:06.721 --> 09:09.423
Was kind of saving it,
but what the hell, right?

09:09.425 --> 09:10.523
Saving it for what?

09:10.591 --> 09:12.842
It's not important.
Want a sip?

09:12.910 --> 09:15.195
You're offering me some?

09:15.263 --> 09:16.496
It's liquor, isn't it?

09:16.564 --> 09:17.530
Yeah, it's liquor.

09:17.598 --> 09:19.382
Babies aren't
supposed to have liquor.

09:19.450 --> 09:21.751
This would be the most
naughty thing ever.

09:21.819 --> 09:22.859
Do you want a sip or not?

09:22.871 --> 09:24.106
(LAUGHING) Yeah!

Mmm, smooth.

better, but I like this, too.

with you, Brian.

09:45.124 --> 09:46.992
I feel like
a big boy right now.

09:47.060 --> 09:48.694
Yeah, this isn't so bad, right?

09:48.762 --> 09:51.029
It's like a very private party.

09:53.316 --> 09:54.850
I feel like dancing.

09:56.820 --> 09:59.488
Yeah, you know how to move.

10:01.391 --> 10:05.628
That is real... Wow, that is awesome.
I'm really impressed.

10:05.696 --> 10:07.647
Oh, wait, I can
hurdle my own leg

10:07.714 --> 10:09.098
like they used
to do in the '90s.

10:14.738 --> 10:18.040
Okay, all right, this is
gonna sound really weird.

10:18.107 --> 10:19.208
This is gonna
sound really weird,

10:19.275 --> 10:20.715
but I really want
you to do it, okay?

10:20.777 --> 10:21.844
What?

10:21.865 --> 10:24.284
I want you to pierce my ear.

10:25.669 --> 10:27.429
Let's do it.
You mean it?

10:27.487 --> 10:30.756
Because I... Look at my face. I'm totally serious.
Are you totally serious?

10:30.824 --> 10:32.392
I'm with you.
I'm on the train!

10:32.460 --> 10:34.094
Do you have a needle?

10:34.161 --> 10:36.062
There's a pin in the sweater.

10:37.631 --> 10:38.931
Here.

10:38.999 --> 10:40.699
Oh, my God! This is happening!
This is really happening!

10:40.768 --> 10:43.169
Oh, I think this is going
to look so good on me.

10:43.236 --> 10:44.454
You know what else?

10:44.521 --> 10:47.306
Oh, maybe I'll buy
a glove with no knuckles.

10:47.365 --> 10:51.017
I voted for McCain.

10:51.085 --> 10:54.671
Okay, left ear. Left ear. Right
now, stick it in. Come on, dude.

10:54.739 --> 10:56.390
Can I just say before...

10:56.458 --> 10:58.158
Can we just, like, take two...

10:58.226 --> 11:00.644
I love... You're so brave.

11:00.712 --> 11:02.596
I just love how brave
you're being right now.

11:02.664 --> 11:04.798
This is like the closest
I've ever felt to you.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.984
Okay. Oh, my God, I was
thinking the same thing.

11:07.051 --> 11:10.453
We are so "us" right now.
Do you know that?

11:11.606 --> 11:13.574
Okay, okay, okay.

11:13.641 --> 11:15.159
Okay, here we go.

11:15.226 --> 11:16.160
(SCREAMS)

11:16.227 --> 11:17.761
Oh, my God!

11:17.829 --> 11:18.679
Oh! Are you okay?

11:18.746 --> 11:19.846
Is it over?

11:19.914 --> 11:21.865
I think. I don't know
where the pin went.

11:21.933 --> 11:23.366
Wait, move your hand.

11:24.886 --> 11:27.454
Oh, wow! Oh! Shit!

11:27.522 --> 11:28.722
What? What? What is it?

11:28.730 --> 11:30.214
It's stuck in there.

11:30.282 --> 11:32.402
I think the pin's too thick
to go all the way through.

11:32.450 --> 11:33.784
Get it out!

11:33.852 --> 11:34.852
(SCREAMS)

11:34.920 --> 11:36.020
Got it.

11:36.087 --> 11:37.037
How's it look?

11:38.173 --> 11:39.340
Cool.

11:39.408 --> 11:40.825
Really? Oh, that's good.

11:40.892 --> 11:44.195
Oh, I knew it was...
I knew it would look cool.

11:44.262 --> 11:49.283
Wait, don't we have to put an earring
in it so the hole won't close?

11:49.351 --> 11:51.352
I don't think it's gonna close.

11:51.419 --> 11:55.807
I can't believe
I have pierced ears.

11:55.874 --> 11:59.009
I'm one of those people
who I talk about.

11:59.077 --> 12:01.145
Finally, no more clip-ons,
you know?

12:01.213 --> 12:05.216
Hey, give me some of that. Don't hog that there.
Give me some of that.

12:05.284 --> 12:08.119
It looks really good, Stewie.

12:08.187 --> 12:11.772
I wish we had a mirror 'cause I
actually did a really good job.

12:11.774 --> 12:13.541
Oh, yeah, it's awesome.
I'm not worried.

12:15.210 --> 12:17.311
Hmm. Cozy.

12:18.096 --> 12:19.764
So, question.

12:19.831 --> 12:21.132
Yeah?

12:21.199 --> 12:23.734
This is gonna seem stupid,
but I've been dying to know.

12:23.802 --> 12:28.405
The Dog Whisperer. What is that?
Is any of that true?

12:28.473 --> 12:30.074
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
I've offended you.

12:30.142 --> 12:31.662
No, no, no, no,
not at all, Stewie, no.

12:31.709 --> 12:34.912
Some of that stuff is right on.

12:34.980 --> 12:37.081
Really? Wow. Well, give
me a "for instance."

12:37.149 --> 12:38.916
Well, the guy talks about...
Cesar Millan?

12:38.984 --> 12:42.319
Right, Cesar Millan talks
about living in the moment

12:42.387 --> 12:46.223
because that's how dogs live, you know?
We live in the moment.

12:46.388 --> 12:47.875
I hope he's not Mexican.

12:47.960 --> 12:50.241
There's something off about
him, but I hope it's not that.

12:50.262 --> 12:53.214
You know, people can learn
a lot from dogs, you know?

12:53.216 --> 12:55.968
A lot. Like, we're like... Like here's us...
We're like, "Yeah!"

12:56.035 --> 12:58.269
(GRUNTING) Like that...

12:58.337 --> 13:00.388
Okay, sure, sure, relax, relax.

13:00.456 --> 13:02.624
It's just, well, you don't...

13:02.692 --> 13:06.161
You don't really do any
of those things, do you?

13:06.229 --> 13:08.179
Yeah, I do. Wait.
What are you talking about?

13:08.247 --> 13:12.117
It's just, I don't know... I mean
do you really live with purpose?

13:12.185 --> 13:13.752
How could you say that to me?

13:13.820 --> 13:15.354
Just calling it like I see it.

13:15.405 --> 13:18.824
Listen, why don't you... You know what?
You can just go to hell!

13:18.892 --> 13:21.610
Hey, whoa, whoa. Look, I
didn't mean to start anything.

13:21.678 --> 13:23.998
Let's just forget it, okay?
We're having a good time.

13:24.046 --> 13:25.496
I don't want to forget it.

13:25.564 --> 13:27.732
How dare you tell me that my
life doesn't have purpose?

13:27.800 --> 13:29.920
No, that's not what I said.
That's what you're saying.

13:29.986 --> 13:32.253
No, no, no. Don't do that. Don't
try to turn my words on me.

13:32.321 --> 13:34.722
And, you know what, take that sweater off.
You look like a little queer.

13:35.005 --> 13:38.307
Are you trying to hurt me?
Because you've succeeded.

13:38.375 --> 13:40.176
Oh, just calling it
like I see it.

13:40.227 --> 13:42.177
Oh, I see.
Is that what we're doing?

13:42.246 --> 13:44.113
All right, well, I'll
play that game with you.

13:44.181 --> 13:45.564
Oh, yeah?
What are you gonna do?

13:45.632 --> 13:47.166
You think I care about you?

13:47.234 --> 13:48.267
I don't.

13:48.335 --> 13:49.886
Yes, you do.
I know you do.

13:49.953 --> 13:51.353
I don't really care.

13:51.421 --> 13:53.756
No, you're just smart enough
and you're just clever enough

13:53.824 --> 13:55.157
to occasionally amuse me.

13:55.225 --> 13:58.360
If I had anybody else, anybody
else to choose from, I would.

13:58.428 --> 14:02.565
You are the best of a bad situation.
Nothing more.

14:02.633 --> 14:04.350
I use you, man.

14:04.418 --> 14:06.135
Yeah, I would know
if you were using me.

14:06.203 --> 14:08.788
Oh, you would?
I got you to eat my poop.

14:08.856 --> 14:10.089
And you know why I did it?

14:10.156 --> 14:11.891
Yeah, you were afraid
you were going to get sick.

14:11.948 --> 14:14.109
Because I wanted
to see if I could.

14:14.682 --> 14:15.849
You're a monster.

14:15.916 --> 14:17.350
Hey, you started
this whole thing.

14:17.418 --> 14:19.586
You son of a bitch,
I could kill you for that!

14:19.588 --> 14:20.720
Oh, really?
Well, how convenient.

14:20.788 --> 14:23.029
You've got a gun right there.

14:24.141 --> 14:26.226
Here you go, Brian. You want to kill me?
Kill me with this.

14:26.293 --> 14:28.528
Oh, but there are no
bullets in it, are there?

14:28.595 --> 14:30.613
Yeah, there are. I lied.

14:30.681 --> 14:32.249
Oh, you're so full of crap.

14:53.248 --> 14:54.314
I'm sorry, Stewie.

14:54.382 --> 14:55.416
Me, too.

14:58.019 --> 14:59.140
How long is this gonna last?

14:59.153 --> 15:00.187
No idea.

15:10.147 --> 15:11.849
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

15:17.288 --> 15:19.255
I hope I'm not bothering you.
Nope.

15:19.323 --> 15:21.992
Just doing some stretching.
Maybe a few poses.

15:23.628 --> 15:25.128
You'll tell me if
I'm bothering you, right?

15:25.196 --> 15:26.763
Uh-huh.

15:26.795 --> 15:28.830
Oh, yuck.
What happened to my ear?

15:28.832 --> 15:30.165
We pierced it.

15:30.233 --> 15:32.167
Oh, yeah.

15:32.235 --> 15:34.569
A lot of crazy shit
went on last night.

15:34.637 --> 15:36.204
Well, we were both drunk.

15:36.272 --> 15:37.939
Oh, of course, of course.
Oh, yes, that's right.

15:38.007 --> 15:40.708
We were four pillows to
the breeze, my friend.

15:40.776 --> 15:41.909
I don't know
what the phrase is.

15:41.977 --> 15:43.457
What're you...
What are you reading?

15:43.513 --> 15:44.912
<i>David Copperfield.</i>

15:44.980 --> 15:46.948
It looks old.
It's a first edition.

15:47.016 --> 15:48.883
That's why I keep it
in my safety deposit box.

15:48.951 --> 15:50.218
It's by Charles Dickens.

15:50.286 --> 15:51.520
Giggity.

15:56.158 --> 15:57.225
What are you doing?

15:57.293 --> 15:58.426
I was hungry.

15:58.661 --> 15:59.582
You want one?

15:59.611 --> 16:01.246
You've had energy bars
this whole time?

16:01.314 --> 16:02.447
You idiot!

16:02.515 --> 16:05.550
Not energy bars.
Jenny Craig Anytime Bars.

16:05.618 --> 16:07.686
And you just bitched
yourself out of a bite.

16:07.737 --> 16:10.538
All right, I'm sorry. All
right, can I have one, please?

16:10.606 --> 16:11.807
All right.

16:11.874 --> 16:13.842
Can you give me a caramel one?
No.

16:13.910 --> 16:14.976
You can have...

16:15.044 --> 16:17.212
Um... Um...

16:17.279 --> 16:18.914
You can have...

16:18.981 --> 16:20.148
Um...

16:20.216 --> 16:21.850
You can have strawberry yogurt.

16:29.147 --> 16:30.580
Hey, Bri?

16:30.648 --> 16:32.249
Yeah?

16:32.317 --> 16:33.750
How come you have a gun?

16:34.670 --> 16:35.870
I don't know.

16:35.872 --> 16:36.854
What do you mean
you don't know?

16:36.921 --> 16:38.689
What about all
that liberal crap

16:38.757 --> 16:41.525
you're always spewing about
stricter gun regulations?

16:41.592 --> 16:43.461
You even cried after Columbine.

16:43.528 --> 16:45.162
Because that was
a national tragedy.

16:45.229 --> 16:47.314
Oh, it was kind of
a regional tragedy.

16:47.382 --> 16:48.298
Whatever.

16:48.366 --> 16:50.000
It's just weird, you know?

16:50.068 --> 16:52.169
I mean, you're the last person
anybody would expect to have a gun.

16:52.236 --> 16:54.104
Well, that's why I keep
it here, where it's safe.

16:54.106 --> 16:56.725
That doesn't make any sense. Why
have it if you're not gonna use it?

16:56.772 --> 16:59.089
You know, I really don't want to
talk about this with you, Stewie.

16:59.162 --> 17:01.464
But I want to know.
Just tell me. Come on.

17:01.532 --> 17:04.000
No.
Come on, please.

17:04.067 --> 17:06.552
(EXHALES)

17:06.620 --> 17:10.806
I keep it in case I ever want
to commit suicide, okay?

17:11.608 --> 17:12.574
Wow.

17:13.827 --> 17:15.094
Oh!

17:15.161 --> 17:17.513
Oh, my God. You're serious.

17:18.248 --> 17:19.799
But why, Brian?

17:19.866 --> 17:21.467
You wouldn't understand.
You're just a kid.

17:21.535 --> 17:23.803
Well, I could try.

17:23.821 --> 17:27.757
I don't know.
Sometimes it's all too much.

17:27.759 --> 17:29.058
What is?

17:29.125 --> 17:30.576
Life. Everything.

17:30.644 --> 17:35.898
Just having the gun here, knowing
there's a way out, it helps.

17:35.966 --> 17:38.717
Yes, but a gun, it's so messy.

17:38.878 --> 17:41.880
It just seemed
the quickest way, I guess.

17:42.448 --> 17:44.149
I suppose.

17:44.217 --> 17:47.118
But I don't quite understand
why you're so unhappy.

17:48.938 --> 17:52.624
Yesterday when you said
I don't live with purpose,

17:53.793 --> 17:56.361
you were right. I don't.

17:56.429 --> 17:58.463
What purpose does my life have?

17:58.531 --> 17:59.814
I don't like when
you talk like this.

17:59.816 --> 18:01.783
Oh, it's true, Stewie.

18:01.785 --> 18:04.586
Dogs are supposed to be able to
instinctively live with purpose,

18:04.620 --> 18:07.105
not even to have think about
it, just born like that.

18:07.173 --> 18:09.992
But I wasn't.

18:10.059 --> 18:13.128
You know, I've tried to find
meaning in my life, and I just...

18:13.196 --> 18:14.596
I just can't.

18:16.399 --> 18:18.433
And that bottle of scotch?

18:18.501 --> 18:20.969
I was saving it
for my last drink.

18:21.037 --> 18:22.537
Wow, heavy.

18:24.311 --> 18:27.245
So is that why we came here?

18:27.880 --> 18:29.114
Were you gonna end it?

18:29.182 --> 18:30.882
No, I was just putting money
in my Christmas club.

18:30.950 --> 18:32.217
God, I have to get
one of those.

18:32.285 --> 18:34.645
You know, last year
I only had $30 saved

18:34.688 --> 18:37.423
when the holidays came around.
I was so embarrassed.

18:37.490 --> 18:40.258
I think I gave Meg tape.

18:40.360 --> 18:43.679
Well, you're the only person
I've ever told this to.

18:45.549 --> 18:47.116
Aren't you gonna say anything?

18:47.118 --> 18:49.384
Well, I don't know what to say.

18:49.452 --> 18:51.887
Wanting to kill yourself...

18:51.955 --> 18:54.023
Well, I think that's
pretty selfish of you.

18:54.090 --> 18:55.290
How is that selfish?

18:55.676 --> 18:58.210
What would I do
if you weren't here? Mmm?

18:58.278 --> 19:00.546
You're the only one
who makes my life bearable.

19:00.630 --> 19:03.866
I thought you said I was the
best of a bad situation.

19:03.934 --> 19:06.568
I was just trying to hurt
you 'cause you hurt me.

19:06.636 --> 19:09.438
But the truth is you're
my only friend, Brian.

19:09.506 --> 19:11.206
If I didn't have you,
I'd be lost.

19:11.208 --> 19:12.207
You'd be okay.

19:12.242 --> 19:13.492
No, I wouldn't.

19:13.560 --> 19:16.111
I don't really care for anybody else.
Just you.

19:16.163 --> 19:17.596
You're the only one I like.

19:18.881 --> 19:21.116
Well, thanks.

19:21.784 --> 19:24.019
I like you a lot.

19:24.087 --> 19:27.490
I guess you could say
I really like you.

19:28.891 --> 19:32.561
I would even dare to go
a little further perhaps.

19:32.629 --> 19:35.264
I care a great deal about you.

19:35.332 --> 19:37.065
A very great deal.

19:37.134 --> 19:38.601
Maybe even

19:39.702 --> 19:41.337
deeper than that.

19:42.372 --> 19:44.507
I... I...

19:44.574 --> 19:45.941
I love you.

19:46.676 --> 19:48.110
I mean, not in like a,

19:48.178 --> 19:50.512
"Hey, let's, you know, let's
have an underpants party,"

19:50.580 --> 19:52.861
or whatever grown-ups do
when they're in love,

19:52.916 --> 19:57.085
but I mean I love you
as one loves another person

19:57.153 --> 19:59.822
whom one simply
cannot do without.

20:00.357 --> 20:02.024
Well, I...

20:02.091 --> 20:03.992
I love you, too, Stewie.

20:04.060 --> 20:06.395
You give my life purpose.

20:06.463 --> 20:09.615
And maybe that's enough.

20:09.682 --> 20:14.186
Because that's just about the greatest
gift one friend can give another.

20:15.605 --> 20:17.105
Thank you.

20:17.340 --> 20:18.457
Hey.

20:18.525 --> 20:19.558
What?

20:19.626 --> 20:20.826
Will you read to me?

20:20.860 --> 20:22.177
Sure.

20:22.245 --> 20:24.913
Wait, wait, wait. I want
to get all snuggled in.

20:24.981 --> 20:27.016
Okay, go.

20:27.100 --> 20:29.734
"Chapter One,
'I am Born.'

20:29.802 --> 20:32.404
"Whether I shall turn out to
be the hero of my own life,

20:32.472 --> 20:35.140
"or whether that station shall
be held by anybody else,

20:35.208 --> 20:37.443
"these pages must show.

20:37.510 --> 20:40.512
"To begin my life with
the beginning of my life,

20:40.580 --> 20:44.416
"I record that I was born on a
