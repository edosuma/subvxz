WINDSTORM AND THE WILD HORSES

02:33.560 --> 02:34.880
Hello!

02:35.560 --> 02:36.880
Are you asleep?

02:38.600 --> 02:41.559
- She isn't really asleep?
- No! Of course not.

02:42.280 --> 02:43.634
She...

02:44.160 --> 02:45.958
She's just thinking.

02:46.640 --> 02:48.393
- Mika!
- What? Who? Where?

02:48.600 --> 02:51.160
I paid for the full package,
came all this way

02:51.400 --> 02:54.711
to find out what's wrong with my horse,
and now?

02:54.960 --> 02:56.713
This! Hah!

02:56.880 --> 02:59.440
Your horse is fine. The problem is you.

03:02.520 --> 03:05.319
Yeah, like I need
to hear that sort of thing!

03:05.920 --> 03:09.880
Come on, Empedocles. We're leaving.
Right! Walk on!

03:10.120 --> 03:12.112
We... are... walking...

03:12.360 --> 03:14.192
for... wards.

03:15.160 --> 03:16.833
Forwards!

03:17.560 --> 03:20.359
- You see how he ignores me? You see?
- Yes.

03:20.640 --> 03:23.917
- Yes, because you do the same to him.
- What?

03:27.240 --> 03:28.594
Outrageous!

04:01.600 --> 04:05.913
At Kaltenbach we allow our horses
a great deal of freedom.

04:06.160 --> 04:08.356
By that I mean that we adopt...

04:09.080 --> 04:10.673
What's it called?

04:11.320 --> 04:13.516
- Huh?
- Natural horsemanship.

04:13.680 --> 04:17.515
Isn't there a German word for it?
"Natural riding art".

04:17.760 --> 04:19.591
- That'll do.
- There she is!

04:19.839 --> 04:24.357
- I've seen her on YouTube.
- Mika, come over here and say hello.

04:29.120 --> 04:30.679
- Hello.
- Sabrina here.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.392
- She'd like...
- Shaquina!

04:35.640 --> 04:38.951
This young lady would like
to learn something.

04:39.200 --> 04:42.159
- Horse whispering.
- Yes, of course.

04:48.280 --> 04:49.873
Oh, sorry!

04:50.120 --> 04:53.079
Archie, stop!
No! What are you doing? Stop!

04:54.520 --> 04:59.515
Of course, "freedom" doesn't mean
the horses run around as they please.

04:59.760 --> 05:01.592
Of course not.

05:21.040 --> 05:22.360
Of course!

05:41.520 --> 05:43.000
Hello, Windstorm.

06:02.520 --> 06:05.240
Oh, yeah?
Did he get over the fence again?

06:06.720 --> 06:08.837
Well, he is a jumper after all.

06:11.280 --> 06:15.797
- He's lonely since 34 has been indoors.
- She didn't want to be outside.

06:16.280 --> 06:18.033
Horses can be like that.

06:19.080 --> 06:23.040
- You have to do something.
- What? I deal with people all day.

06:23.280 --> 06:25.920
People with stupid questions
and stupid... hats.

06:35.080 --> 06:36.799
What's that?

06:39.200 --> 06:41.920
I dream about it. Almost every night.

06:42.800 --> 06:44.678
It's really strange...

06:44.920 --> 06:46.593
Like it's calling me.

06:48.320 --> 06:51.916
- How stupid does that sound?
- That's something you're good at.

06:52.160 --> 06:53.992
Trusting in your dreams.

06:55.360 --> 06:57.591
You really don't know what it is?

07:06.120 --> 07:09.318
- Huh?
- Some kind of whorl. He's always had it.

07:11.280 --> 07:13.033
That's funny.

07:13.200 --> 07:16.876
How can someone know so much
about horses and yet so little?

07:19.720 --> 07:21.996
It's his brand mark.

07:22.160 --> 07:24.755
- It tells you where Windstorm is from.
- And?

07:25.400 --> 07:28.837
- Where is he from?
- No idea. There are thousands.

07:29.080 --> 07:31.436
You'd have to look it up in a book.

07:38.160 --> 07:40.550
- Hello?
- Where are you? I need you!

07:40.800 --> 07:44.237
- Lady is so cheeky!
- Do horses go through puberty?

07:44.520 --> 07:46.716
- She antagonises me.
- He won't do as I say.

07:46.960 --> 07:48.917
I simply lost control.

07:49.160 --> 07:50.719
He just doesn't listen.

07:50.960 --> 07:51.791
- Outrageous!
- Cheeky!

07:52.040 --> 07:54.350
- Naughty!
- I'll ask my husband for a new one.

07:58.040 --> 08:00.999
I'm sorry. I've had a tough day.

08:03.640 --> 08:06.280
- What's wrong?
- They're so thick-headed!

08:06.560 --> 08:10.156
They say the horses are the problem,
but it's them!

08:10.320 --> 08:14.155
- But, Mika, that's what we're here for.
- But...

08:15.800 --> 08:20.272
- It's not the way I imagined it.
- Yes, it's different. For me too.

08:20.960 --> 08:23.270
Sometimes you just have to change.

08:23.560 --> 08:25.358
Try out new things.

08:25.640 --> 08:27.233
Try out new things?

08:27.520 --> 08:30.433
You haven't ridden for years
though you could!

08:36.240 --> 08:37.754
Sorry.

08:41.360 --> 08:42.589
It's just...

08:43.799 --> 08:45.439
Windstorm is lonely.

08:46.600 --> 08:49.354
I don't know
if it's the right place for him.

08:52.360 --> 08:55.592
Is Kaltenbach the right place for you?

08:57.600 --> 09:00.991
- What?
- Mika, you have a very special gift.

09:01.240 --> 09:04.950
But here that's not all you have.
You have a responsibility.

09:05.680 --> 09:09.515
Your mum never felt right here
and I didn't notice that.

09:09.760 --> 09:12.992
I don't want to make
the same mistake again.

09:14.880 --> 09:17.156
Is it a mistake?

09:18.640 --> 09:20.120
Maybe.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.514
Again?

10:24.120 --> 10:26.589
Your grandmother won't be pleased.

10:30.960 --> 10:33.350
- What that?
- My special recipe.

10:33.640 --> 10:35.313
Good for the heart.

10:36.200 --> 10:38.669
Talking of hearts, by the way...

10:41.960 --> 10:44.270
Windstorm is unhappy, and I...

10:45.240 --> 10:47.755
- And I can't help him.
- Mika.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.630
You can't be everything for Windstorm.
You're not a horse.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.392
- Even if you sometimes forget that.
- Ever wonder where you belong?

10:58.080 --> 11:00.436
Of course. That was a long time ago.

11:00.720 --> 11:03.918
Back then I couldn't see
the wood for the trees.

11:04.160 --> 11:07.790
So I went away,
somewhere where there weren't any trees.

11:07.960 --> 11:09.872
I took a journey.

11:10.840 --> 11:13.275
But... I don't know where I would go.

11:14.560 --> 11:16.313
Work that out for yourself.

11:17.840 --> 11:20.514
Do you still have that dream, Mika?

11:22.200 --> 11:24.760
There's somebody else like you.

12:04.560 --> 12:06.995
Okay. That was a ridiculous idea.

12:24.640 --> 12:27.599
BREED AND STUD FARM BRANDS OF SPAIN

12:39.800 --> 12:41.280
<i>"The silver thistle of Ora.</i>

12:41.440 --> 12:45.639
<i>Brand of the Ora stud farm
in the province of Cádiz in Andalusia.</i>

12:45.880 --> 12:48.520
<i>Ora is one of the last places
where wild horses live."</i>

12:48.680 --> 12:50.160
Andalusia!

13:02.800 --> 13:04.757
WELCOME TO ANDALUSIA

13:43.400 --> 13:46.632
SAM, GRANDMA, MR KAAN

14:21.080 --> 14:23.993
"Goodby"... is actually spelt B-Y-E.

14:26.080 --> 14:27.719
I'm sorry.

14:27.880 --> 14:29.314
I wanted...

14:30.000 --> 14:31.514
Hey.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.515
It's okay. I think it's good.

14:36.520 --> 14:39.558
I just don't want you to ride at night.

14:39.960 --> 14:41.838
So I thought

14:42.080 --> 14:43.912
I'd accompany you.

14:45.120 --> 14:46.713
Where are you going?

14:47.920 --> 14:49.957
To Andalusia.

14:50.720 --> 14:52.154
What?

14:52.800 --> 14:56.157
- Do you know how far that is?
- Just as far as the sea?

14:58.800 --> 15:00.393
Okay.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.432
As far as the sea.

15:19.920 --> 15:22.674
And? Do you know the way?

15:22.920 --> 15:25.754
It's all here. Fanny would be so proud.

15:27.880 --> 15:31.271
I want to see
where Windstorm comes from and...

15:32.000 --> 15:34.117
Find out where you belong?

15:39.200 --> 15:40.714
You think...

15:42.040 --> 15:43.793
people belong anywhere?

15:46.200 --> 15:48.237
I think we belong where we are.

15:51.160 --> 15:52.674
You can sleep.

15:53.080 --> 15:55.311
Nonsense. I'm wide awake.

16:53.320 --> 16:55.232
Come with me.

16:56.360 --> 16:59.717
- I have to go back to 34.
- Why? What's wrong with her?

17:05.119 --> 17:07.316
Don't worry about it.

17:07.680 --> 17:11.117
All that matters for you now
is in that direction.

17:12.720 --> 17:15.189
An adventure awaits you.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.598
Come with me.

17:21.400 --> 17:23.960
Some things you have to do on your own.

17:34.360 --> 17:36.113
Off you go.

17:56.840 --> 17:58.559
Mika!

17:59.680 --> 18:01.637
"Adiu" is spelt with an E too.

19:23.360 --> 19:25.192
Fanny! Where are you?

19:26.040 --> 19:30.159
<i>In the wardrobe. I had to put up
with a two-hour French manicure.</i>

19:31.160 --> 19:33.550
They're crazy, these Frenchwomen!

19:33.800 --> 19:36.634
- But she won't find me in here.
- Fanny!

19:37.640 --> 19:39.438
- Fanny!
- Oh, God!

19:40.080 --> 19:41.719
But... where are you?

19:42.360 --> 19:44.113
<i>On a boat going to Cádiz.</i>

19:44.360 --> 19:46.556
- Andalusia.
<i>- Is that Windstorm?</i>

19:47.040 --> 19:49.874
Yes. We're going to Ora.
On an adventure.

20:19.680 --> 20:21.160
Spain.

21:29.280 --> 21:31.192
He really mumbled, didn't he?

21:38.880 --> 21:40.394
This isn't working.

23:11.080 --> 23:13.037
Sorry.

23:17.080 --> 23:18.594
German?

23:20.200 --> 23:25.798
In Friedrichshafen, on Lake Constance,
I ate the best spätzle noodles ever.

23:25.960 --> 23:28.520
But spätzle noodles need a good sauce.

23:28.760 --> 23:31.070
Without the sauce, they're nothing.

23:31.320 --> 23:33.960
They taste best
with marinated roast gravy.

23:34.200 --> 23:36.431
- And with it...
- Okay then!

23:36.720 --> 23:39.758
It's been nice chatting,
but we have to move on.

23:39.920 --> 23:43.709
- And where are you going, <i>chica</i> ?
- Well... Ora.

23:45.120 --> 23:47.112
Ora?

23:47.680 --> 23:51.151
- I haven't heard that name in ages.
- You know it?

23:52.680 --> 23:56.833
Every Andalusian horse fan,
every Andalusian, knows the race.

23:57.080 --> 24:00.994
Spain's fastest and wildest horses
ran in the Ora Race.

24:01.240 --> 24:03.516
They said that the horse

24:03.760 --> 24:05.433
that won the Ora Race

24:05.960 --> 24:08.316
was the "soul" of Andalusia.

24:12.840 --> 24:14.877
But like many old traditions,

24:17.960 --> 24:20.395
that, too, was abandoned.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.356
You mean... Ora doesn't exist anymore?

24:24.520 --> 24:26.432
<i>Chica</i>, I'm sorry.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.276
You're about 30 years too late.

24:31.680 --> 24:35.560
The race course runs somewhere
a few kilometres north of here.

24:37.360 --> 24:39.636
Somewhere? Can you be more precise?

24:41.040 --> 24:42.793
Good luck, <i>chica</i>!

26:35.040 --> 26:38.158
- You're a girl!
- Bravo, Sherlock. Yes, I'm a girl.

26:39.160 --> 26:41.516
- You can speak German!
- Double bravo!

26:41.680 --> 26:43.876
So, where have you been?

26:44.120 --> 26:46.715
- We've waited a week for you.
- Waited? For me?

26:47.920 --> 26:51.072
You Work & Travel people
always have a screw loose.

26:53.400 --> 26:57.076
- Work and what?
- Okay, nice and slow so you understand.

26:57.240 --> 27:00.438
You're Sonja, right?
You're from Germany, like us?

27:00.720 --> 27:03.155
And you want to work here?

27:04.160 --> 27:05.958
Right! I'm Sonja.

27:07.240 --> 27:09.232
- And you are?
- Sam.

27:10.400 --> 27:11.675
Really?

27:12.240 --> 27:14.311
You got a problem with that?

27:15.320 --> 27:17.960
Of course not. It's a nice name.

27:19.880 --> 27:22.998
- You don't look 19.
- I'm small for my age.

27:23.240 --> 27:26.312
Shower and loo are outside.
Works starts at 5:30.

27:26.520 --> 27:28.557
Meals at 11:30 and 8:00. Questions?

27:28.720 --> 27:31.792
- Can I make a phone call?
- I don't know, can you?

27:46.600 --> 27:47.670
Dreamy!

29:01.400 --> 29:03.039
<i>Hola</i>, everyone!

29:17.800 --> 29:19.553
- Sonja?
- What? Who?

29:21.160 --> 29:22.674
Right! Yes?

29:22.920 --> 29:25.037
I'd like to welcome you here.

29:25.200 --> 29:27.510
I'm Pedro, the ranch owner.

29:27.680 --> 29:30.036
You already met my daughter Samantha.

29:30.280 --> 29:32.670
Yes, Sam... antha.

29:34.600 --> 29:36.592
Is that you in this photo?

29:40.960 --> 29:42.917
We don't talk much. We work hard.

29:43.160 --> 29:44.958
And eat well.

29:48.600 --> 29:51.911
- Sit down, wherever you like.
<i>- Si! Grazie!</i>

29:59.200 --> 30:01.271
That was Italian? I mix them up.

30:04.880 --> 30:06.917
We have very few rules here.

30:08.960 --> 30:10.633
I love rules.

30:20.280 --> 30:21.919
The next one.

30:36.560 --> 30:38.040
Ora.

30:38.680 --> 30:40.160
Tomorrow...

30:41.200 --> 30:42.714
I'll find...

30:43.520 --> 30:45.000
Ora.

31:59.320 --> 32:01.357
Sorry if I've woken you up.

32:03.160 --> 32:05.356
I had another annoying dream.

32:08.120 --> 32:10.237
You're trembling.

32:11.200 --> 32:12.634
It was only a dream.

32:43.520 --> 32:45.113
Are you ready?

32:53.320 --> 32:54.879
It's cooling.

33:48.160 --> 33:49.992
- Get lost!
- Hey!

33:50.240 --> 33:52.800
Are you crazy? What were you doing?

33:53.040 --> 33:56.670
- None of your business!
- It is! You probably did it to mine.

33:56.920 --> 33:58.559
He never forgot it.

33:58.800 --> 34:01.235
I brought him back here, of all places.

34:01.400 --> 34:03.278
Because I thought...

34:04.360 --> 34:05.874
I thought...

34:08.679 --> 34:10.433
Hey, Sonja!

34:13.520 --> 34:15.318
My name isn't Sonja.

34:16.760 --> 34:20.879
You came all the way here
just because of the brand mark?

34:21.040 --> 34:24.192
We had to get out of the woods.
Too many trees.

34:27.040 --> 34:29.396
Well, now everything makes sense.

34:30.120 --> 34:32.554
What was going on back there?

34:33.199 --> 34:36.431
- I failed again. That was going on.
- Why?

34:36.719 --> 34:39.030
- You couldn't hurt him. That's okay.
- No.

34:39.880 --> 34:43.112
Horses are our business,
and it's not going well.

34:43.280 --> 34:48.309
Things are tough for Dad and he doesn't
like us getting close to the horses.

34:49.120 --> 34:51.396
Why brand one horse late at night?

34:53.280 --> 34:57.433
Horses live wild here, and we have
to catch one every now and again.

34:57.720 --> 34:59.632
Especially colts.

34:59.880 --> 35:03.510
- We must control numbers.
- Wild horses? But how...

35:04.680 --> 35:05.670
- Go!
- But...

35:05.920 --> 35:07.149
Later. Say nothing!

35:07.400 --> 35:09.392
Remember. Work starts at 7:00.

35:10.440 --> 35:14.514
Mika, for the hundredth time,
what's wrong? Call me back.

35:16.080 --> 35:17.594
Fanny?

35:19.400 --> 35:23.599
- Fanny, shopping!
- No more "Fanny!" No more shopping.

36:18.360 --> 36:20.670
That happened to you too, right?

36:30.720 --> 36:32.632
Hey, little one.

36:59.800 --> 37:04.079
We have to repair those fences.
The pastures quickly get overgrazed.

37:04.320 --> 37:07.040
Listen...
Where exactly are the wild horses?

37:07.280 --> 37:09.556
Forget about it!
I've said all I want to.

37:09.800 --> 37:12.838
Okay? We're here to repair the fences.

37:24.560 --> 37:27.029
<i>Mika, come in. This is Sam.</i>

37:27.600 --> 37:29.432
Roger, over, Alpha.

37:29.720 --> 37:32.030
<i>How far have you got?</i>

37:33.680 --> 37:35.399
Almost finished.

37:35.680 --> 37:40.232
<i>Don't move until I come get you.
Don't go beyond the end of the fence.</i>

37:45.240 --> 37:48.153
I wonder what's beyond
the end of the fence.

37:59.720 --> 38:01.200
Oh, great.

39:02.400 --> 39:04.517
You thinking what I'm thinking?

39:37.920 --> 39:41.880
- What bit of "don't move" don't you get?
- Well...

39:42.120 --> 39:44.396
Both "don't" and "move", I'd say.

39:45.920 --> 39:47.877
- Out. We have to work.
- Come on!

39:48.120 --> 39:50.919
Don't be a wet blanket.
Or, <i>be</i> a wet blanket!

39:54.880 --> 39:56.951
I haven't been here for ages.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.832
One!

40:03.600 --> 40:05.080
Two!

40:54.840 --> 40:56.797
Why don't you come here?

40:56.960 --> 40:58.952
I'd come here all the time.

40:59.600 --> 41:01.034
It's...

41:01.280 --> 41:03.715
Oh, I don't know. It's complicated.

41:16.920 --> 41:19.037
It's on land my dad has to sell.

41:20.240 --> 41:21.720
Apart from that...

41:23.800 --> 41:24.950
What?

41:32.000 --> 41:33.116
Tara!

41:35.520 --> 41:37.751
- She's been gone two days.
- Who?

41:38.000 --> 41:39.514
Calima, and her foal.

41:39.760 --> 41:42.355
A dominant mare doesn't leave the herd.

41:42.640 --> 41:46.429
- And I saw your tyre tracks.
- We don't have her. She's your horse.

41:48.320 --> 41:53.918
No, she belongs only to herself.
But you probably can't understand that.

42:01.160 --> 42:03.117
Levante!

42:05.320 --> 42:07.198
How... Wait a minute!

42:07.440 --> 42:09.159
- No!
- Hey!

42:16.560 --> 42:18.950
- Who was that?
- My aunt.

42:19.640 --> 42:24.078
- And what does "Levante" mean?
- It's a wind. An easterly wind.

42:32.440 --> 42:34.193
Wait for me!

42:41.280 --> 42:43.272
Sam! Sam, Sam, Sam!

42:44.360 --> 42:45.840
What?

42:47.120 --> 42:49.351
For me? You shouldn't have.

42:49.640 --> 42:52.280
- What is it?
- A silver thistle.

42:52.960 --> 42:54.952
- It grows everywhere here.
- Here?

42:55.200 --> 42:57.317
What is "here"? What's it called?

42:58.040 --> 43:00.999
Ora. This is the Ora Spring.

43:03.880 --> 43:05.519
Ora!

43:09.520 --> 43:12.035
My dad and Tara used to be inseparable.

43:12.200 --> 43:15.034
But she got crazy ideas
about handling horses.

43:15.760 --> 43:19.674
When my dad bought that mare
from Germany it all kicked off.

43:19.840 --> 43:21.991
- What?
- The fight between them.

43:22.440 --> 43:24.909
And that mare? Was it Calima?

43:25.760 --> 43:29.879
Halla's daughter, a really crazy horse.
Totally... wild.

43:30.560 --> 43:34.349
Hurt everyone, including Dad.
No one could get near, except...

43:35.600 --> 43:37.080
Tara.

43:37.240 --> 43:39.755
They wanted to give her away
or put her to sleep.

43:40.000 --> 43:43.118
One night, Tara took her away,
to the wild horses.

43:43.680 --> 43:49.312
She lives with horses behind the spring,
in my great-grandparents' house.

43:51.440 --> 43:53.591
- She's totally crazy.
- What? No!

43:53.840 --> 43:56.275
No? Weren't you looking properly?

43:56.560 --> 43:59.394
She threatened her niece
with a gun just now.

44:01.520 --> 44:03.955
Calima is Windstorm's mother, right?

44:04.880 --> 44:06.997
<i>Sam, where the hell are you?</i>

44:07.240 --> 44:08.560
Oh, damn!

44:21.400 --> 44:24.871
- I have to speak to Tara again.
- No! Absolutely no way!

44:25.200 --> 44:28.193
- And not a word to my dad, okay?
- Where were you?

44:30.440 --> 44:32.113
The colts need moving.

44:36.360 --> 44:38.829
- Why is your hair wet?
- Water bottle.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.117
I was clumsy and dropped it.

44:43.080 --> 44:44.912
And what's that?

44:45.640 --> 44:47.677
Nothing. I'm into botany.

44:50.920 --> 44:53.435
You know that's dangerous. And why.

44:56.960 --> 45:01.591
If you're so interested in botany,
there are three fields of hay to mow.

45:03.360 --> 45:04.396
Okay.

45:07.000 --> 45:08.912
<i>I'd like to make a toast.</i>

45:10.520 --> 45:12.398
I have good news.

45:13.440 --> 45:16.239
The mayor and I
have come to an agreement.

45:17.000 --> 45:20.880
You know the decision to sell the land
was a hard one for me.

45:22.120 --> 45:24.954
But I know
that it will be in good hands.

45:25.840 --> 45:27.513
With friends.

45:59.200 --> 46:01.351
Tara vanished in this direction.

46:21.400 --> 46:22.720
"Water Flow"?

48:30.640 --> 48:31.994
Man!

49:59.360 --> 50:00.874
It's all right.

50:01.040 --> 50:02.554
I'm fine.

50:35.560 --> 50:37.279
THE STUD FARM

51:15.680 --> 51:17.160
Hello?

51:29.600 --> 51:31.273
<i>The sleeper,</i>

51:31.560 --> 51:35.236
<i>born with the gift of understanding
the language of horses.</i>

51:36.880 --> 51:38.553
But...

51:47.760 --> 51:50.150
I thought I'd be seeing you again.

51:53.040 --> 51:55.032
Windstorm.

51:55.200 --> 51:59.114
Of all the ones who were caught,
I worried about him most.

52:00.360 --> 52:02.955
He has such a sensitive soul

52:03.120 --> 52:04.952
and a strong will.

52:06.280 --> 52:09.751
It's a dangerous combination
for life among humans.

52:10.000 --> 52:14.836
- So he was born here and then caught?
- Mm-hm. Then my brother sold him.

52:16.040 --> 52:19.954
He has valuable genes.
However, he was lucky.

52:20.200 --> 52:22.157
He found you.

52:23.360 --> 52:25.511
- Or I found him.
- You found each other.

52:26.760 --> 52:27.989
Okay.

52:29.840 --> 52:31.399
Come with me.

52:31.680 --> 52:33.876
I'll introduce you to his family.

52:35.080 --> 52:37.311
That's why you came here, right?

52:39.200 --> 52:40.919
I think so.

52:57.440 --> 52:59.159
Ready?

53:00.560 --> 53:02.631
Ready.

55:00.240 --> 55:03.119
A herd is like
a single, living organism.

55:03.360 --> 55:05.670
Each horse plays its part.

55:08.920 --> 55:11.833
Each bears responsibility
for the community.

55:14.800 --> 55:16.871
You think they remember him?

55:17.840 --> 55:19.399
Maybe.

55:19.600 --> 55:20.920
Look.

55:21.160 --> 55:23.800
They're responding very well
to Windstorm.

55:24.720 --> 55:28.077
Every movement,
even just a flicker of the ear.

55:28.320 --> 55:30.789
He certainly remembers them.

55:32.000 --> 55:35.596
But like any horse
that joins a new herd he will learn

55:35.840 --> 55:40.596
to find his place, to negotiate,
to make requests or even demands.

55:44.040 --> 55:47.158
Most people assume
a stallion leads a herd,

55:47.400 --> 55:50.359
but it's actually a mare
who is the herd leader

55:50.640 --> 55:54.350
when they flee together
or are in search of water.

55:57.440 --> 55:59.671
Without a herd a horse feels vulnerable

56:00.400 --> 56:02.039
and lonely.

57:11.680 --> 57:14.070
- Do you feel that?
- Yes.

57:45.360 --> 57:46.919
He looks so happy.

57:47.400 --> 57:49.153
It's his family.

57:50.000 --> 57:51.832
Mine too.

57:53.280 --> 57:55.840
And what about Pedro and Sam?

57:56.440 --> 57:58.557
I don't need any people.

58:00.320 --> 58:03.677
I think that we need both.
People and horses.

58:03.920 --> 58:08.915
My brother stole the foal and Calima,
although he knows what she means to me.

58:09.160 --> 58:12.232
- People like that?
- I don't think he has her.

58:12.520 --> 58:14.432
I can sense her fear.

58:14.960 --> 58:16.553
- But Sam says...
- Sam!

58:16.800 --> 58:19.759
Sam repeats everything her father says.

58:20.000 --> 58:24.119
The problem is they only consider
what they can get out of the horses

58:24.280 --> 58:26.431
instead of what they can give them.

58:27.000 --> 58:28.912
My brother thinks only of money.

58:29.600 --> 58:32.559
That's true. He's sold the spring.

58:34.400 --> 58:35.436
What?

58:37.320 --> 58:40.631
Without the spring,
the horses can't live here.

58:42.080 --> 58:44.072
Ora is the beating heart.

58:45.200 --> 58:48.079
- Well, then we have to talk to him.
- No.

58:55.120 --> 58:56.634
We do.

59:31.840 --> 59:33.194
Calima!

59:41.640 --> 59:43.199
We need help.

59:54.640 --> 59:56.040
Help!

01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:09.518
She's dehydrated.

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:15.913
But her leg isn't broken.
You didn't find her a minute too soon.

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:19.759
A few more hours
and we'd have been too late.

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:21.673
He found her.

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:31.393
Don't touch her!

01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:37.797
Should I let her die? You'd prefer that?
Is it more natural?

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:39.872
I don't need you. Go away.

01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:45.431
The wound is infected.
Your herbs are no good.

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:49.270
- Give me her or shoot her. I don't care.
- You never did care.

01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:51.870
This happens when horses run wild.

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:54.430
They get injured and die.

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:58.760
- That's your "freedom"!
- Your greed makes them die of thirst.

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:01.238
What are you talking about?

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:03.910
You sold Ora, the water. How could you?

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:06.595
I haven't sold the water.

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:09.355
I gave the land back to the community.

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:11.313
I need the money, for my horses.

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:15.833
"Your horses, your water."
None of it is yours. None of it!

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:18.754
As you wish.

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:24.593
But be quick.

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:26.959
She's suffering.

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:30.831
No! I don't believe this.
This isn't about you two.

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:33.152
She'll die if she doesn't go.

01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:38.954
And I think
that you have sold the water.

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:48.877
- Water Flow?
- It's all around the spring.

01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:51.359
A helicopter was there.

01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:53.999
That can't be!

01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:57.160
He promised me it'd stay as it is.

01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:00.910
It just can't be.

01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:05.113
Let him take her.

01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:13.279
They really spoke?

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:17.757
Well,
I wouldn't exactly call it "speaking".

01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:21.599
And what's that?

01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:24.559
Oh that.
I completely forgot. Sonja's here.

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:26.917
I mean, the real Sonja.

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:31.277
Hello?

01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:34.837
- Sonja?
- I have two questions.

01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:37.436
Who is Sonja?
And who would call this thing a shower?

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:39.393
Fanny!

01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:42.313
Another non-Sonja?

01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:51.200
Wild! That much just can't happen
in a single week.

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:53.033
- Impossible!
- Sadly, not.

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:57.194
- You can't leave her alone five minutes.
- Yeah, I've noticed that.

01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:01.830
Is this thing finished or what?
We shouldn't be here.

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:06.872
Thanks for coming so late.

01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:08.873
Want to eat something?

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:11.040
Sit down.

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:14.114
Pedro's seabass paella!

01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:16.672
I won't say no to that.

01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:28.752
Delicious!

01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:33.676
I want to withdraw from our deal.

01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:38.752
You never said you'd sell the spring.
You promised me my sister...

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.799
I promised nothing. Read the contract.

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:46.551
We shook hands on it, as friends.

01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:49.713
I'm the mayor. And I'm a businessman.

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:53.715
That's how business is done.
You should be grateful to me.

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:55.872
Tara will finally get out of that ruin.

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:02.555
That "ruin" was the home
of our great-grandparents.

01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:06.830
And you know as well as I
that her horses can't survive

01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:08.878
without that spring.

01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:16.273
You're naive, Pedro. You really thought
the horses could stay?

01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:21.991
Wild horses! Water Flow is going
to build a bottling plant here.

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:26.598
They don't care if they have
to shoot coyotes, wild pigs or horses.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.957
What was that?

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:40.233
My stomach, probably.

01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:44.075
This paella leaves a strange taste.

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:46.718
But we're finished anyway.

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:48.953
I assume?

01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:52.199
Yes, we're finished.

01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:20.117
- Water Flow! That's crazy!
- You know who that is?

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:23.229
Of course.
Don't you read the <i>Financial Times</i> ?

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:26.592
<i>- Business Weekly</i> ? <i>National Geographic</i> ?
- Fanny!

01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:29.914
Okay.
Water Flow is a food and beverage firm.

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:34.120
They buy water sources
from poor communities who don't know

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:35.794
how valuable water is.

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:38.950
But they're going to shoot the horses.

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:43.956
And what's going to happen to Tara?
He didn't want this...

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:46.590
Hey, we're going to stop this. Right?

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:50.197
Yes, of course.

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:52.116
Okay...

01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:53.953
Let's see.

01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:01.158
Right then...
We could chain ourselves to trees.

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:02.834
No.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.037
An explosion might...

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:17.280
Yeah! Do you have anything... old?

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:21.715
A Medieval dig, a Celtic castle?

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:25.715
- A pharaoh's tomb?
- A pharaoh's tomb? No.

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:28.113
Damn!

01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:31.876
If the land had a cultural monument,
it couldn't be sold.

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:34.393
- It'd be protected.
- Damn!

01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:36.114
Damn!

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:51.311
Does it have to be a monument?
Can't it be an old custom?

01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:55.833
- Something linked to the land?
- Like the Maritime Festival in Piraeus.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.356
Then I know how we can save Ora.

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:10.876
- The Ora Race.
- A race that hasn't been run in ages.

01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:16.313
- But it can take place again, in Ora.
- A horse race? How surprising!

01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:24.554
So first of all
we have to talk to your dad.

01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:29.552
- He's with Calima in the stable.
- Okay, fine. And, Mika...

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:32.271
Remind me we have to make posters.

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:36.914
Mika?

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:45.991
- Might that be...
- Tara.

01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:50.511
But she hasn't come here
as long as I can remember.

01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:53.593
I wonder what she wants.

01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:55.672
She's come for her horse.

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:11.232
Hello, dear sister.

01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:23.118
She lost a lot of blood, but she...

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:28.551
She has a strong heart.

01:08:33.439 --> 01:08:36.238
- I still see it after all these years.
- What?

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:39.115
How much you mean to each other.

01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:45.117
For a long time, I didn't understand it.
Or I didn't want to understand.

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:48.234
The fact you preferred horses to people

01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:50.033
made me angry.

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:52.752
I was really angry as well.

01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:05.353
I'm so sorry.

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:14.629
I sold Ora and can't go back on it.

01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:20.591
- Tell him.
- No!

01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:22.354
- Yes!
- Now!

01:09:26.399 --> 01:09:29.154
I... I mean to say, I...

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:40.511
Okay, we don't have a pharaoh's tomb
but if we bring back the Ora Race...

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:42.911
- The Ora Race...
- Yes.

01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:47.996
Ora will be a cultural site and
the government can't sell to Water Flow.

01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:49.879
- Right?
- Roughly.

01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:54.194
According to Section 23, Paragraph 2
of the Spanish Culture Law

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.113
cultural sites cannot be sold.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:02.075
- That would have been a wonderful idea.
- "Would have"? What's the problem?

01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:10.031
Prehistoric washing instructions?

01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:14.513
This was the starting and finish line.
The horses turned at Ora.

01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:18.352
That's the spring, Ora.
And next to it is...

01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:19.960
a sun.

01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:22.112
And that is...

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:25.920
- A moon?
- A full moon in the daytime.

01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:29.358
- That's when the race started.
- Full moon and sun.

01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:31.711
How often does that happen?

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:36.351
- Every three to five years.
- There's the problem.

01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:40.680
- That's too long to wait.
- No. I'd say it isn't enough time.

01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:45.799
- How long until it's full?
- Five days.

01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:48.594
Damn!

01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:57.239
What's up?
We can work this out. I mean...

01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:00.035
It's a bit overgrown but we'll manage.

01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:03.751
We need to do some weeding,
mark the course, that's all.

01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:08.277
- Someone will come.
- It has to be at least 200.

01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:11.192
- Two hundred?
- Yeah.

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:14.035
That's the criteria for a cultural site.

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:18.671
Didn't I mention that?

01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:33.676
Five days!

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:35.798
- Two hundred people!
- Impossible!

01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:46.319
- Who's that
- Sonja?

01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:48.956
Tourists love hiring donkeys.

01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:53.596
No, that's...

01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:56.875
- Sam!
- Yeah?

01:11:57.600 --> 01:11:58.920
- Sam!
- What?

01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:00.275
Different Sam.

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:17.795
Your grandma was really worried
and driving us crazy, so I volunteered.

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:21.192
Everything's been great,
apart from the donkey.

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:22.999
- No more donkeys!
- Sam.

01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:36.076
Yeah, and how are things here?

01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:47.192
- Well then, let's do it!
- Wasn't he listening?

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:50.159
- Weren't you listening?
- The horses need the water.

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:52.437
And the race can save them.

01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:55.838
- What's up with you?
- Man!

01:12:56.080 --> 01:13:00.040
- We can't organise it in five days.
- Nonsense!

01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:03.751
- Mika learnt dressage in four weeks.
- It's true.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.674
- That was impossible.
- You can do dressage?

01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:11.356
Sam's right. We have to try.

01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:15.793
And if anyone can organise 200 people
in five days, it's Fanny.

01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:35.232
What if no one joins up?

01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:39.957
Sorry. How annoying of me.

01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:46.551
Say anything and I'll break your teeth.

01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:50.359
- It looks...
- Very...

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:53.917
- Flouncy?
- It's our national dress, okay?

01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:57.594
- Look!
- Ow!

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.036
161.

01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:20.230
162.

01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:21.669
163. <i>Merci!</i>

01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:23.912
164. <i>Grazie!</i>

01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:29.113
165.

01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:39.000
- Not sure we'll make it.
- Nonsense!

01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:42.039
- Tomorrow's another day.
- It doesn't start till noon.

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:43.714
Right.

01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:10.639
And? Fewer trees in the way now?

01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:14.113
Different trees.

01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:17.392
I wish you were here.

01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:19.796
I don't have to be there to be there.

01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:21.910
True.

01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:23.674
Still miss you though.

01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:28.315
Tell me something about home.

01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:35.837
Same as ever.
Archibald chased the postman yesterday.

01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:38.754
<i>I don't think we'll ever get mail again.</i>

01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:42.238
I miss you too.

01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:45.951
<i>- See you soon.</i>
- See you then.

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:02.594
Stop!

01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:11.999
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare them off.

01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:14.079
I'm sorry.

01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:29.754
The Ora Race!

01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:33.716
- I never thought I'd see it again.
- Hello!

01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:37.633
So you found
what you were looking for, <i>chica</i> ?

01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:39.519
Yes, I think so.

01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:43.112
- Are you participating?
- No!

01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:45.840
I'm here on work for the government.

01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:47.879
Culture Department.

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:34.756
- How many do we have? Count again.
- We have 195.

01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:37.113
It's almost noon.

01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:40.718
I don't think
we'll sell any more tickets.

01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:49.231
I'm so sorry, Pedro.

01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:53.992
But it has to be 200.
Or I can't sign the protection contract.

01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:58.196
Yes, I know.

01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:01.760
- But the Ora Race will still take place!
- No.

01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:05.040
It won't. Pedro, I'm disappointed.

01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:08.079
I thought I had made myself
perfectly clear.

01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:13.794
This race is taking place on land
that belongs to Water Flow Inc.

01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:19.073
- I'm afraid we do not authorise it.
- He's right, unfortunately.

01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:22.633
If the legal conditions aren't fulfilled

01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:25.395
there's nothing I can do.

01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:28.635
Please stop the event
and leave our land.

01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:31.554
Felling of the trees starts today.

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:34.395
Just one minute! This is our land.

01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:37.320
If you're here,
you need to buy a ticket.

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:45.630
- Don't be silly, little girl, yeah?
- I'm not silly.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.912
And I'm not little.

01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:55.637
All right then.
Gentlemen, we don't want to be rude.

01:21:55.880 --> 01:21:58.111
- Do we?
- Here.

01:21:58.360 --> 01:22:00.272
Now, if you don't mind...

01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:02.313
One moment.

01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:05.592
- And?
- It's 199.

01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:23.758
I'll give you a sign.

01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:35.512
Er, excuse me?

01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:38.792
Is this Work & Travel?

01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:41.350
- Sonja!
- Am I too late?

01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:43.279
No!

01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:46.153
Adrian Muñoz,

01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:48.676
Andalusian government representative.

01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:50.718
The land you're on

01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:52.679
is a protected site.

01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:54.160
I don't believe it.

01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:56.357
The race can begin!

01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:39.792
You have to get on his back.

01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:58.759
<i>The horse that wins the Ora Race...</i>

01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:02.080
<i>is said to be the "soul" of Andalusia.</i>

01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:01.717
- Where is she? Can you see her?
- No.

01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:05.032
- Mika, where are you?
- Here I am.

01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:08.952
- What?
- Why?

01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:11.240
It's his race.

01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:51.836
<i>I'm with you.</i>

01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:58.272
<i>Faster!</i>

01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:03.600
<i>Faster!</i>

01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:31.669
<i>Faster!</i>

01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:07.234
<i>Faster!</i>

01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:32.672
Windstorm.

01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:03.956
I just got confirmation from Madrid!

01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:07.796
Effective immediately,
the Ora Race is officially

01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:10.953
an Andalusian cultural treasure!

01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:07.397
What have you got in here?

01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:10.200
Only necessities.

01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:16.198
Hey, I've known her longer.

01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:18.594
Well, then...

01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:20.752
- Have fun in Barcelona.
- Thanks.

01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:26.712
Thanks for everything.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:40.118
- You're really leaving already?
- Yes.

01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:42.432
I have to go home.

01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:47.511
Thank you.
You two saved much more than just Ora.

01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:52.119
You'll always have a home here.

01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:56.036
- And so will he.
- We really have to go now.

01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:03.000
I...

01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:05.711
have something here for you.

01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:13.592
I made it for you.
From Windstorm's tail hairs.

01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:17.590
- It's not a friendship bracelet.
- Course not.

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:21.193
Thanks anyway.

01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:28.351
I'll miss you. Come back soon.

01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:37.914
Come on.

01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:39.912
I'll take you home.

01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:15.594
Windstorm.

01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:21.797
- There you are.
- We just wanted to say goodbye.

01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:25.235
I have to go home now.

01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:27.513
I know.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.037
They're grazing back there.

01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:36.354
It's getting late.
We really should be going. Come on.

01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:44.200
Yes?

01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:52.592
I know it isn't always easy
to have our gift.

01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:58.430
To sense things intuitively
that other people don't even notice.

01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:04.193
Like describing colour
to a blind person.

01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:09.951
But we mustn't stop trying.

01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:12.993
We're only human.

01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:22.040
And we do need other humans.

01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:25.710
You know what the hardest thing is?

01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:39.752
Having to do the right thing
though we don't want to.

01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:45.037
Yes.
And that's the reason why you came here.

01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:48.237
Not to say goodbye to me.

01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:51.434
And not
so that Windstorm can say goodbye.

01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:54.319
You're here...

01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:57.036
to say goodbye to Windstorm.

01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:18.199
Come on.

01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:45.674
Okay?

01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:10.552
You don't need it anymore.

01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:43.796
Go on then.

01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:47.638
Go ahead!

01:36:56.640 --> 01:36:58.950
I'm fine, honestly.

01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:01.719
Go!

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.559
Be free.

01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:26.680
Show-off!

01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:25.760
Hello?

01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:35.554
Hello?

01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:53.434
Mika!

01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:55.599
You're back!

01:39:55.760 --> 01:39:57.194
Hi, Gran.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:00.514
Where's Windstorm?

01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:04.670
Home.

01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:12.037
What are you doing?

01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:17.432
I was thinking that maybe...
it's about time.

01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:19.871
Gran! Really?

01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:23.111
But I can't do it by myself.

01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:27.400
- I need your help.
- Of course! I'd love to. Right now?

01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:31.151
No, we've plenty of time
to get round to that. But...

01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:33.596
Over there is somebody else

01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:36.191
who has been waiting for you.

01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:09.198
You're just in time.

01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:17.800
That's why I had to come back to 34.

01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:22.551
Windstorm has become a father.

01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:26.280
It can't stand up.

01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:48.232
If it doesn't stand up,
then it won't survive.

01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:00.874
Hi, little one.

01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:05.431
You look a lot like your daddy.

01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:16.637
Come on.

01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:29.911
It hasn't got a name yet.

01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:34.196
- How about 35...?
- No.

01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:36.120
No way.

01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:41.672
I set Windstorm free.

01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:51.595
He doesn't have to be here to be here.

01:43:56.080 --> 01:43:57.833
Was it tough?

01:43:58.240 --> 01:43:59.515
Yes.

01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:03.793
But he belongs there.

01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:08.440
Ora!

01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:13.276
We should call the foal Ora.

01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:22.119
It doesn't seem
to have a problem with that.
