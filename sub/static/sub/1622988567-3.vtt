WEBVTT

00:04.004 --> 00:07.048
BENEDICT: We suffer under something
called "The Emergency".

00:07.132 --> 00:12.303
A rapidly escalating state of panic
where the truth itself is under attack.

00:12.387 --> 00:14.681
And I'm convinced
that this Emergency is a fiction

00:14.764 --> 00:16.891
created by one person.

00:16.975 --> 00:18.476
-This is happening.
-

00:18.560 --> 00:21.771
It looks normal,
but listen to what's underneath.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.898
MESSENGER: The missing aren't missing...

00:26.192 --> 00:28.695
Those are the hidden messages
that are being broadcast

00:29.279 --> 00:32.157
on every TV and radio,
and they're infecting our minds

00:32.240 --> 00:33.783
without us even knowing they're there.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.828
BENEDICT: The signals are coming
from the Institute on Harbor Island.

00:36.911 --> 00:40.790
You four are gonna infiltrate
the Institute as my secret agents.

00:40.874 --> 00:43.334
CONSTANCE:
The Mysterious Benedict Society.

00:43.418 --> 00:46.755
BENEDICT: We will be watching
from a hidden position on the mainland.

00:46.838 --> 00:48.965
Day and night,
we will always have eyes on you.

00:49.049 --> 00:52.343
Your first job is to find
the identity of the Sender.

00:52.427 --> 00:53.762
I mean, who is running the school?

00:53.845 --> 00:54.763
REYNIE: Who is the headmaster?

00:54.846 --> 00:57.599
JACKSON: He prefers to introduce himself.
You'll meet him soon.

00:57.682 --> 01:00.852
Next, find the transmitter
that's sending the messages.

01:00.935 --> 01:01.895
What's that?

01:01.978 --> 01:04.105
-JACKSON: The tower.
-JILLSON: You have no reason to go there.

01:04.189 --> 01:05.607
Unless you become Messengers.

01:05.690 --> 01:07.901
Just find out what you can.
Report back to me.

01:07.984 --> 01:11.237
Welcome, new students.
I'm your headmaster, Dr. L.D. Curtain.

01:11.321 --> 01:12.197
These two...

01:12.280 --> 01:14.157
these two are ones to watch.

01:26.753 --> 01:27.712
Ahh...

01:30.799 --> 01:31.925
Hmm.

01:33.676 --> 01:35.762
I'm sorry, Mr. Oshiro,
I didn't mean to interrupt.

01:35.845 --> 01:37.889
I just wanted to thank
our new friends for being here.

01:38.723 --> 01:40.225
Do you see a difference?

01:41.226 --> 01:43.061
It's a feeling in the air, isn't it?

01:44.104 --> 01:49.609
This is the safe harbor.
You made it. The Emergency is out there.

01:49.692 --> 01:51.778
In here, we take care of everything.

01:51.861 --> 01:55.782
So, you can open your mind
to a new way of thinking.

01:56.407 --> 02:02.539
So, you can be intentional.
So, you can be outstanding. Contribute.

02:04.833 --> 02:05.875
Thank you, Dr. Curtain.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.794
-I think we all...
-If I may, Mr. Oshiro.

02:08.503 --> 02:09.921
As the older students can tell you,

02:10.004 --> 02:12.382
I am personally invested
in your experience here.

02:13.174 --> 02:16.219
If you have any issues, any questions...

02:17.178 --> 02:19.013
a member of my staff is always available

02:19.097 --> 02:20.932
to forward that concern
on to their supervisors,

02:21.015 --> 02:22.684
who will then forward it on to me.

02:27.063 --> 02:30.859
Work the system. The system works...

02:32.777 --> 02:34.320
if you work it.

02:40.201 --> 02:42.453
Oh. Hello there.

02:45.373 --> 02:46.791
Is this a test?

02:51.963 --> 02:53.131
Hmm.

03:00.763 --> 03:03.266
CONSTANCE : Clone.
Laboratory-grown. It's common.

03:03.349 --> 03:05.101
I think it makes much more sense if...

03:05.185 --> 03:07.478
If it's a body snatcher scenario. Exactly.

03:08.313 --> 03:09.564
...if it's his twin.

03:10.565 --> 03:12.233
No. It's classic replicata.

03:12.317 --> 03:14.736
STICKY: Mr. Benedict could have
a split personality.

03:14.819 --> 03:17.780
There is such a thing
as dissociative identity disorder.

03:17.864 --> 03:19.866
It can't be. I know it's not him.

03:20.533 --> 03:23.870
He was skinnier than Mr. Benedict,
different hair...

03:25.121 --> 03:28.541
Guys, they're identical twins.

03:37.842 --> 03:39.052
REYNIE: Uh...

03:39.135 --> 03:42.388
Hello, Jackson. Good evening.

03:43.139 --> 03:46.976
Thought I heard multiple voices in here.
Female voices, which makes no sense.

03:47.060 --> 03:50.146
Huh. That's weird. Weird.

03:51.105 --> 03:52.398
Weird.

03:56.694 --> 03:59.030
It's just us. See?

04:09.540 --> 04:11.084
Have an amazing night.

04:22.136 --> 04:24.347
Um, Kate? Where are you going?

04:24.847 --> 04:27.934
I'm going to the Tower, right now.
Scale that thing.

04:28.017 --> 04:30.770
-What?
-The Emergency comes from Messages.

04:30.853 --> 04:32.730
Messages come from a transmitter.

04:32.814 --> 04:36.651
Transmitter? In a high place,
like a tower.

04:38.027 --> 04:39.153
Scale it.

04:39.237 --> 04:41.322
There are people patrolling it
at all times.

04:41.406 --> 04:42.865
That's obvious.

04:42.949 --> 04:44.284
It's way too risky.

04:44.826 --> 04:48.079
The only way into that tower
is as a Messenger.

04:49.122 --> 04:52.208
So, we just have to be
the best of the best.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.836
REYNIE: Do well in our classes
and become Messengers.

05:00.258 --> 05:02.802
-Getting a message from the kids!
-I see it.

05:06.222 --> 05:08.766
BENEDICT:
It's the fourth word I can't find.

05:09.767 --> 05:12.020
-Did you get it?
-Mm-hmm.

05:12.687 --> 05:18.443
"Headmaster named L.D. Curtain.

05:18.526 --> 05:21.904
-Be aware, Gemini."
-Hmm.

05:22.739 --> 05:25.158
L.D. Curtain.

05:25.241 --> 05:28.786
Doesn't ring a bell. Likely an alias.
I'll get on it.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.580
"Be aware, Gemini"?

05:30.663 --> 05:33.291
RHONDA: How do they know
his astrological sign already?

05:33.374 --> 05:37.795
NUMBER TWO: Coded, obviously.
Maybe not astrology, but astronomy.

05:37.879 --> 05:40.131
-RHONDA: Castor and Pollux!
-NUMBER TWO: Right.

05:42.133 --> 05:43.343
Mr. Benedict.

05:45.970 --> 05:50.224
Nathaniel, my brother. My twin.

06:52.370 --> 06:55.498
-NUMBER TWO: You have a brother? A twin?
-Yes. Yes.

06:55.581 --> 06:57.250
And you didn't know about it?

06:57.875 --> 07:01.546
If I had known, I wouldn't be so shocked
and dismayed, which I clearly am.

07:01.629 --> 07:05.341
Of course. The past cannot stay buried.
It cannot be eluded.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.427
It cannot be bargained with.

07:07.510 --> 07:10.763
L.D. Curtain is your brother.
And he's the man we've been hunting?

07:10.847 --> 07:12.473
NUMBER TWO: The man behind The Emergency?

07:12.557 --> 07:13.391
Yes.

07:15.768 --> 07:17.395
How did this happen?

07:23.651 --> 07:25.528
I'm sorry.

07:26.529 --> 07:29.782
This is a part of myself
that's been too painful to share.

07:35.329 --> 07:37.123
I lost my brother.

07:37.707 --> 07:40.084
-And now, I...
-

07:48.926 --> 07:54.974
Stone Harbor Miyagis. Delicate flesh,
a hint of brine on the finish.

07:56.225 --> 07:57.393
Not the time.

08:00.813 --> 08:02.273
I'll take a dozen.

08:10.656 --> 08:15.328
Nathaniel was always brilliant.
Brilliant! Brilliant.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.539
But he was so troubled.

08:21.709 --> 08:25.379
At the age of 12,
a family adopted me out of the orphanage,

08:25.713 --> 08:27.757
but they did not have room for two.

08:29.008 --> 08:30.510
I told him I would come back for him,

08:30.593 --> 08:32.845
but when I did, he was gone. He ran away.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.931
The trail went cold,
and I couldn't find him.

08:36.307 --> 08:39.602
And now, I have. And he's my enemy.

08:40.061 --> 08:43.731
Are you sure?
We just have that one word. "Gemini".

08:43.814 --> 08:45.483
RHONDA: Also, the words "Be aware."

08:45.566 --> 08:47.652
-Technically.
-I priced that in.

08:47.735 --> 08:49.612
-Please, Rhonda.
-BENEDICT: I'm sure. I'm sure.

08:49.695 --> 08:52.031
This all makes terrible sense.

08:52.114 --> 08:53.533
-It's cosmic.
-Where are you going?

08:53.616 --> 08:54.617
To confront him.

08:54.700 --> 08:57.161
Oh, I don't think I heard you right.

08:57.245 --> 08:58.454
A boat. I need a boat.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.706
-That's not gonna happen.
-I need to speak to him.

09:00.790 --> 09:03.626
-RHONDA: What? You'll be spotted.
-I will confront him directly.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.378
-No!
-Milligan, a boat!

09:28.025 --> 09:30.111
I think this is a net positive.

09:30.194 --> 09:33.155
-Oh, yes.
-We have a name.

09:33.239 --> 09:34.490
Hmm.

09:40.580 --> 09:45.543
L.D. Curtain. His brother.
Why didn't he tell us?

09:46.335 --> 09:47.587
He must not have known.

09:48.045 --> 09:49.130
Really?

09:51.090 --> 09:54.760
There's no way he'd hide that from us.
He's an orphan, too.

09:55.219 --> 09:58.848
They could've easily been separated,
lost contact...

09:58.931 --> 10:01.142
If I had a brother,
I'd never lose contact.

10:01.559 --> 10:04.270
Brothers stick together.
That's what they do.

10:04.812 --> 10:06.939
I mean, I assume.

10:07.481 --> 10:09.233
Kids can't always control that.

10:09.442 --> 10:12.153
STICKY: Reynie, we just met Mr. Benedict.

10:12.236 --> 10:14.572
He's already lied to us
about the Boatwright Academy.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.240
How do we know we can trust him?

10:16.824 --> 10:18.576
You saw Mr. Curtain.

10:18.659 --> 10:23.080
Did he seem so horrible to you?
He's responsible for The Emergency?

10:23.539 --> 10:24.999
It's all real, Sticky.

10:25.082 --> 10:26.709
The Emergency is not going away,

10:26.792 --> 10:29.837
and Mr. Benedict is the only one
talking about fixing it.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.839
But we barely know him.

10:36.177 --> 10:39.555
You could say
you and I barely know each other.

10:46.228 --> 10:47.480
We know each other.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.825
Constance! Watch yourself!

11:00.284 --> 11:03.579
We are roomies, Kate.
This is going to happen.

11:05.164 --> 11:07.416
That's going to be a problem.

11:10.252 --> 11:14.965
In circus, how many share a wagon? 15? 20?

11:15.049 --> 11:17.551
-Depends on the wagon.
-So, 15 to 20.

11:17.635 --> 11:18.844
I prefer it to this.

11:19.428 --> 11:24.100
Some are bodybuilders. Very large.
Here, just one small person.

11:26.143 --> 11:29.188
Here's how it's going to be.
We're here to stop The Emergency.

11:29.271 --> 11:30.731
We're here behind enemy lines.

11:30.815 --> 11:34.360
And tomorrow, we go to battle.
I don't need you distracting me.

11:34.443 --> 11:39.657
You will never, ever touch the bucket.
You will respect the bucket.

11:40.491 --> 11:42.952
Feels like this is not
just about the bucket.

11:51.961 --> 11:53.671
Good night, roomie.

12:01.303 --> 12:02.930
Okay, guys. Business time.

12:03.222 --> 12:06.559
You guys are all really smart
so we just have to work hard,

12:06.642 --> 12:08.352
ace it, and become Messengers.

12:08.436 --> 12:09.437
Yeah.

12:10.813 --> 12:13.524
A man carries a package in his right hand.

12:13.607 --> 12:14.900
He approaches a restaurant,

12:14.984 --> 12:17.820
outside of which
wait three left-handed men

12:17.903 --> 12:22.032
and one right-handed man,
who takes the package with his right hand.

12:22.658 --> 12:25.703
All the men are wearing
a winged patch on their coats.

12:26.245 --> 12:29.081
They greet each other with nods
and go inside.

12:29.165 --> 12:33.252
Okay, using only yes or no questions,
what's the story, class?

12:33.753 --> 12:35.379
How did they all end up there?

12:39.925 --> 12:44.388
TEACHER 1: Poets! Prophets!
Disavow obsequious ostentation.

12:44.472 --> 12:45.931
ALL: "Poets! Prophets!"

12:46.015 --> 12:49.185
"Disavow obsequious ostentation."

12:49.268 --> 12:52.188
Subtly obfuscated, majordomo. Kudos.

12:52.271 --> 12:55.733
ALL:
"Subtly obfuscated, majordomo. Kudos."

12:55.816 --> 12:57.234
TEACHER 1: Charlie! Keep up.

12:57.443 --> 13:01.197
This cola with quinine
is a favorite of the jet-set.

13:01.280 --> 13:05.034
ALL: "This cola with quinine
is a favorite of the jet-set."

13:06.619 --> 13:08.162
Are they restaurant critics?

13:08.245 --> 13:11.332
-A baseball team?
-A team of some kind?

13:11.415 --> 13:15.252
No, no,
and that is a fair characterization.

13:19.715 --> 13:20.674
Constance?

13:21.967 --> 13:26.096
The man with the gift
is disfigured horribly?

13:26.180 --> 13:28.015
Correct. Why would you infer that?

13:28.098 --> 13:30.184
The world is a brutal place.

13:30.267 --> 13:31.644
I mean, within the problem.

13:31.727 --> 13:35.105
What's the difference?
All is brutality condition.

13:44.156 --> 13:47.451
TEACHER 2: Simply find the center.

13:50.287 --> 13:53.457
Obviously, the group has failed
at something, a big event,

13:54.166 --> 13:55.918
and it's the man with the package's fault.

13:56.919 --> 14:00.089
I'm sorry, Martina.
I don't think that is correct.

14:00.172 --> 14:03.217
-Hmm. Check again.
-There is nothing to check.

14:03.509 --> 14:04.802
I have the answer right here.

14:12.101 --> 14:15.521
This is a nightmare.

14:15.604 --> 14:17.731
Yeah. Hang in there.

14:19.024 --> 14:21.026
Next level! La doublé!

14:24.071 --> 14:27.491
Next level! La diabolique!

14:32.246 --> 14:33.622
Yes, Reynie?

14:35.583 --> 14:38.294
Did any of the men shake hands?

14:38.377 --> 14:39.545
No.

14:40.129 --> 14:44.550
And, um, was the length of the package
about an arm's length?

14:44.633 --> 14:45.843
Give or take, yes.

14:46.343 --> 14:48.178
Oh, no.

14:49.179 --> 14:52.683
Sorry if anyone finds this a bit macabre,

14:52.766 --> 14:55.936
but I believe the group
was in the military.

14:57.146 --> 14:58.272
Go on, please.

14:58.355 --> 15:01.984
Well, they were a dirigible crew,
shot down in enemy territory.

15:02.067 --> 15:05.654
To survive, sorry to say,

15:06.363 --> 15:08.032
they each had to sacrifice an arm,

15:08.115 --> 15:10.910
below the elbow, for food.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.369
Ew.

15:15.789 --> 15:17.082
REYNIE: But they were rescued

15:17.166 --> 15:18.918
before the last man
had to give up his arm.

15:19.001 --> 15:23.213
And in the package is his left arm,
which he's giving to friends.

15:23.672 --> 15:27.384
As a gesture of fairness and gratitude.

15:27.885 --> 15:33.933
That is correct. And I'm sorry as well.
That was a bit grotesque.

15:40.397 --> 15:42.066
STICKY:
We're never gonna become Messengers

15:42.149 --> 15:44.026
because these classes are crazy.

15:44.109 --> 15:48.072
I can't see a metric for success.
No defined goals. None at all.

15:48.155 --> 15:50.783
It's definitely a lot weirder
than I thought it would be.

15:50.866 --> 15:52.284
It is like a cult.

15:52.785 --> 15:55.204
It is. Then we can't get sucked in.

15:55.287 --> 15:57.623
I'm not much of a joiner, so I'll be okay.

15:57.706 --> 16:00.960
We don't have to be in the cult
to become Messengers.

16:01.251 --> 16:04.755
How do you know that?
We don't even know what Messengers do.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.385
STICKY: Reynie, what are you looking at?

16:12.388 --> 16:18.143
Hey, remember Lindsay?
The girl with, um, the hair?

16:18.978 --> 16:20.646
She was just made a Messenger.

16:22.564 --> 16:24.233
-I'm going in.
-REYNIE: Kate, wait!

16:24.817 --> 16:26.276
STICKY: That's just reckless.

16:27.528 --> 16:31.115
Hey, Lindsay! I'm Kate.

16:31.198 --> 16:33.325
-LINDSAY: Uh...
-Congratulations on the big promotion.

16:33.409 --> 16:37.830
Oh, thanks. It's just, you know,
belief in myself, a lot of hard work.

16:38.998 --> 16:42.584
Cool! Um, what kind of work exactly?

16:43.585 --> 16:44.837
-Well...
-Hey!

16:45.337 --> 16:47.715
Messengers don't talk
about Messenger business

16:47.798 --> 16:49.133
with non-Messengers.

16:49.883 --> 16:52.803
If you weren't so green,
you'd know that, Lindsay.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.055
LINDSAY: Sorry, Martina.

16:56.223 --> 16:58.726
I didn't know
Messenger business was so top secret.

16:59.059 --> 17:00.769
Well, there's a lot of stuff
you don't know.

17:00.853 --> 17:04.148
Oceans of stuff. Deserts.

17:05.357 --> 17:06.817
Mountains.

17:15.576 --> 17:18.495
-Well, I cracked it.
-Kate, you really should be more careful.

17:19.079 --> 17:20.581
I've also been thinking.

17:21.290 --> 17:24.126
We should start hanging out
with other people here, too.

17:24.209 --> 17:27.504
REYNIE: You know, make some friends,
find out what they know.

17:28.464 --> 17:29.298
How?

17:29.381 --> 17:32.301
-If people always see us together...
-MAN 1: Poison apples.

17:32.384 --> 17:35.929
-Pardon, possession, a walk on the shore.
-...then they may start to suspect...

17:36.680 --> 17:38.724
Constance, are you all right?

17:39.349 --> 17:41.018
You can't hear the voice?

17:42.644 --> 17:43.854
What voice?

17:45.397 --> 17:50.152
-Are you okay?
-MAN 2: Terraform, trifle, toxicity...

17:54.490 --> 17:57.534
I'm fine. Look away from me.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.249
Wait!

18:04.333 --> 18:06.543
What? Do you hear something too?

18:07.127 --> 18:08.545
I know who that is.

18:09.379 --> 18:14.301
He looks so different out of a suit,
but that's Mr. Bloom.

18:15.636 --> 18:17.304
Still in the dark here. Bloom?

18:18.764 --> 18:24.520
Mr. Bloom? It's me, Reynie Muldoon.
From Stonetown Orphanage?

18:24.895 --> 18:26.313
Do you remember me?

18:27.231 --> 18:31.276
I have no idea who you are.
Nor do I know a Mr. Bloom.

18:32.903 --> 18:34.196
REYNIE: You're Mr. Bloom.

18:35.322 --> 18:38.242
-That's you.
-Hmm.

18:38.992 --> 18:41.245
I think I'd know if that was my name.

18:44.832 --> 18:47.042
But you should enjoy life here
at the Institute.

18:47.376 --> 18:48.669
I certainly am.

18:55.050 --> 18:56.260
STICKY: What were you doing?

18:56.343 --> 18:57.970
You're not supposed
to talk to the Helpers.

18:58.053 --> 18:59.847
Mr. Bloom is a school inspector.

18:59.930 --> 19:03.308
Or he used to be.
Came for Donor Day every year.

19:03.851 --> 19:06.770
He was actually kind of nice.
You could tell he cared.

19:07.771 --> 19:10.899
He knows me,
but he just looked right through me.

19:11.859 --> 19:13.277
You're not so memorable.

19:14.361 --> 19:16.822
What? Compliment!

19:16.905 --> 19:18.323
How is that a compliment?

19:19.158 --> 19:21.410
He doesn't even remember his own name.

19:21.827 --> 19:22.870
Something happened to him.

19:23.370 --> 19:25.706
There's all kinds of injuries
and disorders

19:25.789 --> 19:27.875
that can cause a loss
of personality effect.

19:27.958 --> 19:30.377
I don't think so.
Something happened to him.

19:30.460 --> 19:32.963
It was really weird, like...

19:33.839 --> 19:35.382
-REYNIE: Like...
-They erased his memory!

19:36.341 --> 19:38.093
Swept his mind.

19:38.177 --> 19:42.139
-That's crazy.
-Yes. Crazy.

19:42.222 --> 19:44.808
It's not like we know
someone just like that.

19:45.893 --> 19:49.938
Lonely. Broken. Does this.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.579
-You going somewhere, sir?
-Oh.

20:06.413 --> 20:08.040
Oh, Milligan.

20:08.582 --> 20:11.710
There's, uh,
there's critical papers at home

20:12.044 --> 20:14.004
that I need
that I'm realizing might be the key.

20:14.087 --> 20:17.341
Ah, and... and, uh,
you are gonna get them? Or...

20:17.424 --> 20:19.426
That's absurd to you?

20:19.509 --> 20:23.138
-Just my job, my role. I sort of...
-I can't just sit here. I...

20:23.222 --> 20:26.308
He's my brother. I have to stop him.
I have to take action.

20:26.391 --> 20:29.144
-I have to take direct action!
-Your safety can't be risked, sir.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.897
I know. I know.

20:33.732 --> 20:36.360
I ask so much of you.
So much of all of you.

20:36.443 --> 20:39.613
Yes. But you give more.

20:39.696 --> 20:40.656
BENEDICT: Yeah.

20:43.742 --> 20:47.037
Now, where are they, exactly?
These papers, Mr. Benedict?

20:50.540 --> 20:52.876
In a pastel-blue AeroPost envelope...

20:52.960 --> 20:53.877
Located in the...

20:53.961 --> 20:56.505
...with unmistakable blue and red chevrons
along the edges.

20:56.588 --> 20:57.464
Located in the...

20:57.547 --> 20:59.800
And there's a crease on the right side...
Nope! The left.

20:59.883 --> 21:01.551
As you read the address, it's to the left.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.679
Located in the...

21:04.263 --> 21:06.932
-In roll-top desk in my study.
-

21:09.017 --> 21:10.769
Listen, Milligan, uh...

21:13.272 --> 21:14.439
It's vital.

21:16.441 --> 21:17.609
I won't let you down.

21:18.235 --> 21:19.278
Yeah.

21:19.361 --> 21:21.613
-Mi...

21:24.992 --> 21:26.076
Thank you.

21:32.457 --> 21:34.876
-What's happening?
-It's Thursday.

21:35.752 --> 21:37.296
I love Thursdays.

21:41.633 --> 21:45.137
Hey, Charlie.
You're a Thursday guy, aren't you?

21:46.221 --> 21:49.141
WOMAN 1: Everybody, move. Out of my way.
Coming through.

21:56.440 --> 21:58.317
Your God can't help you now.

21:58.775 --> 22:03.155
Please, please, please...

22:03.238 --> 22:04.448
STICKY: It's students' names.

22:04.531 --> 22:06.742
I think it's rankings?

22:06.825 --> 22:11.246
Huh. Look at that. Number one again.

22:11.830 --> 22:14.458
Applause not necessary.

22:18.337 --> 22:22.758
I think this means that Sticky and I
are doing well in our classes.

22:28.597 --> 22:31.141
So, if Constance and I are in yellow...

22:31.433 --> 22:33.977
In China, yellow means good luck.

22:34.478 --> 22:38.523
-Are we in China, George?
-No.

22:39.107 --> 22:40.609
No, we're not.

22:46.198 --> 22:49.743
So, what happens to Charlie?

22:57.042 --> 22:59.711
-

23:06.134 --> 23:10.847
So, if Constance and I don't
get our grades up, we're next?

23:12.099 --> 23:14.810
Ferry on. Barge off.

23:15.936 --> 23:17.479
I admire the purity.

23:18.605 --> 23:22.484
Did you see his face when he got on?
Do you think they swept him?

23:22.567 --> 23:26.196
-CONSTANCE: I would. Logical.
-REYNIE: No, no, no. I can't get erased.

23:26.279 --> 23:27.614
You're not the one on the block.

23:27.697 --> 23:29.950
-We can help you study.
-Study what?

23:30.033 --> 23:31.326
How to pronounce kway-neen?

23:31.785 --> 23:35.580
-It's kwhy-nine.
-Actually, either way is acceptable.

23:36.289 --> 23:38.667
These tests are testing something
I don't have.

23:39.918 --> 23:41.169
Let's face it, guys.

23:42.295 --> 23:45.257
-That's me.
-How do you just accept that?

23:45.590 --> 23:49.052
Mr. Benedict said this mission
was going to take all four of us.

23:49.511 --> 23:52.472
And I believe him.
We've all got different skills.

23:52.556 --> 23:54.599
REYNIE: Sticky and I
may be good at these tests,

23:54.683 --> 23:56.560
but we can't see things the way you do.

23:56.810 --> 23:58.562
You're a much better climber, too.

23:58.645 --> 24:01.523
Yeah! And Constance...

24:05.193 --> 24:06.611
I'll stay for the food.

24:07.904 --> 24:10.615
Point made. Clearly, I'm an asset.

24:10.699 --> 24:16.079
Agreed. So, we have to make sure
you don't get barged.

24:16.788 --> 24:20.208
Or worse. Much worse.

24:57.454 --> 24:59.956
Oh, I didn't know the library

25:00.040 --> 25:02.792
lent out their microfiche machines.
That's nice.

25:04.461 --> 25:09.049
As you can see,
there is no Nathaniel Benedict.

25:09.132 --> 25:11.343
He's gone. No records anywhere.

25:11.843 --> 25:16.598
Oh, he did change his name to L.D. Curtain
sometime after the age of 12.

25:16.806 --> 25:18.433
That's the assumption.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.393
But assumptions can be deadly, eh?

25:20.477 --> 25:23.271
We wanted to make sure
he was your brother.

25:23.355 --> 25:25.732
Here was our confirmation.

25:26.358 --> 25:27.609
Hmm.

25:29.361 --> 25:30.654
NUMBER TWO: Look familiar?

25:32.280 --> 25:34.616
-Your hesitation is warranted,

25:34.699 --> 25:37.786
but if you divide the distance
from the earlobe to the shoulder

25:37.869 --> 25:40.205
by the distance from the earlobe
to the center of the nose...

25:40.789 --> 25:42.374
The Crochet-Guardado ratio.

25:42.457 --> 25:44.459
Yes. It's an exact match to yours.

25:46.294 --> 25:50.674
L.D. Curtain is, as you thought,
your long-lost brother.

25:51.883 --> 25:55.512
Now, his public profile is limited.
Seemingly purposefully so.

25:55.595 --> 25:59.182
But his name is attached
to some scientific papers,

25:59.266 --> 26:01.017
pursuing some very strange threads.

26:01.977 --> 26:04.646
He worked at an aeronautical institute,

26:04.729 --> 26:08.817
working on a phased-pulse transmitter
meant to send data packages to satellites.

26:09.359 --> 26:12.070
Hmm. He was a scientist and an engineer.

26:12.153 --> 26:13.905
As well as a philosopher.

26:13.989 --> 26:16.950
-He worked at Trommsgard Kollectif...
-Oh.

26:17.033 --> 26:19.452
...studying meta-ontological dichotomies.

26:19.536 --> 26:21.871
His name is only on these papers
because they had to be.

26:21.955 --> 26:24.416
He has otherwise very purposely flown
under the radar.

26:24.499 --> 26:26.293
These papers are quite impressive.

26:26.376 --> 26:28.628
He does seem to be considered
quite the visionary,

26:28.712 --> 26:31.256
especially in the field of neuroscience.

26:31.339 --> 26:32.507
Ah, clearly.

26:32.591 --> 26:33.925
While excelling in all of them.

26:34.259 --> 26:37.387
And yet he's very rarely photographed, eh?

26:37.470 --> 26:39.764
Even when he won the Hiroki grant
at the age of...

26:39.848 --> 26:41.725
-What?
-You were up for that twice!

26:42.142 --> 26:44.227
I was. Hmm.

26:45.061 --> 26:50.025
He's, um... It's a good win.
He's quite accomplished.

26:50.108 --> 26:52.527
-Ooh, and fit.
-Hmm.

26:52.611 --> 26:56.156
It seems he won an intramural
rowing competition while at university.

26:56.406 --> 26:59.326
-Grueling sport.
-Oh, incredibly so.

26:59.743 --> 27:01.161
BENEDICT: Hmm.

27:01.244 --> 27:04.247
Well, we just don't know
what connects all these fields of study.

27:04.331 --> 27:06.791
-Hm. That's what we have to discover here.
-Yes.

27:07.042 --> 27:10.920
RHONDA: The one hole in our research
comes after the orphanage.

27:11.004 --> 27:14.883
It's as if he scrubbed
Nathaniel Benedict from the record.

27:15.425 --> 27:21.056
That and the avoidance of photos, to me,
speaks of a very great pain.

27:21.931 --> 27:24.017
-A great and festering...
-Excuse me.

27:46.164 --> 27:47.916
You think he's okay?

27:48.958 --> 27:50.919
He just has to work through some things.

27:51.002 --> 27:53.046
-He'll be fine.
-Ah.

27:55.632 --> 27:57.801
STICKY: I wonder if brainsweeping hurts.

27:57.884 --> 27:59.052
KATE: Of course, it does.

27:59.135 --> 28:00.720
-It might not be too...
-JACKSON: Reynie.

28:01.554 --> 28:03.973
Mr. Curtain wants to see you.

28:07.352 --> 28:10.814
He does? Why? Now?

28:11.398 --> 28:12.232
Right now.

28:23.660 --> 28:25.620
Say goodbye to his...

29:29.267 --> 29:31.394
-WOMAN 2: The study?
-

29:31.478 --> 29:33.021
Curtain said full coverage.

29:33.104 --> 29:34.939
WOMAN 2: Really?
I'd say you only need cameras

29:35.023 --> 29:36.232
on the entrances and exits.

29:37.066 --> 29:38.234
MAN 3: You tell him that.

29:56.085 --> 29:57.545
-BOY: My dad will be back soon.
-Ah!

29:58.129 --> 30:00.632
Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.

30:02.342 --> 30:03.468
It's okay.

30:05.970 --> 30:07.514
Mr. Curtain is your father?

30:08.348 --> 30:12.393
Yeah. He adopted me when I was a baby.

30:15.772 --> 30:17.690
That's a really good drawing.

30:17.774 --> 30:21.694
-Are you joking?
-Why would I do that?

30:24.989 --> 30:26.032
Is that a bluebird?

30:26.950 --> 30:29.953
-I think it's a George.
-Is that a type of bird?

30:30.036 --> 30:34.207
Well, maybe not a type,
but that's this one's name.

30:34.290 --> 30:36.125
I just look at them for a while,

30:36.209 --> 30:38.294
and it becomes very clear
what their names are.

30:38.878 --> 30:43.550
-Sometimes their careers, too.
-Birds have careers?

30:43.633 --> 30:45.218
CURTAIN: Mr. Muldoon!

30:46.010 --> 30:51.266
Ah. It is incredible to see you.
I'm so glad you decided to come by.

30:51.766 --> 30:56.896
-You summoned me.
-I did. Please, sit.

30:59.274 --> 31:03.945
Reynard Muldoon. Reynard the Fox!

31:04.028 --> 31:08.783
Oh. So, how are you, Reynie?

31:09.909 --> 31:12.370
Was the onboarding process smooth?

31:12.453 --> 31:15.123
Um... Yeah. Very smooth.

31:15.206 --> 31:19.794
Oh, good. I have to tell you,
I was very eager to meet you, Reynie.

31:19.878 --> 31:23.840
Your test scores were quite impressive.

31:23.923 --> 31:25.174
Thank you.

31:25.258 --> 31:27.844
You know, a lot of people
consider me a maverick.

31:28.595 --> 31:31.222
I'm kind of different
in charting my own path,

31:31.890 --> 31:33.975
and I don't see you as bland
or unremarkable at all.

31:35.059 --> 31:36.978
In fact, I see you as
a natural-born leader.

31:37.061 --> 31:39.230
With great promise. Brilliance, even.

31:39.856 --> 31:42.483
And, unlike others, I don't find
your scores surprising in the least.

31:43.443 --> 31:45.862
CURTAIN: Here's the thing.
I don't like to overpromise.

31:45.945 --> 31:50.158
I don't think that's ethical.
But the way it has been trending,

31:50.825 --> 31:56.080
you may achieve Messenger status faster
than any student in our history, Reynie.

31:56.581 --> 32:01.336
-That would be great.
-That would be spectacular.

32:03.004 --> 32:05.465
You're an exceptional student, Reynie.

32:05.548 --> 32:08.760
You are destined to do amazing things
in this institute.

32:11.220 --> 32:15.767
Now, let's switch gears.
Tell me about this Sticky.

32:16.351 --> 32:20.521
That's an unusual name, isn't it?
You two seem awfully close.

32:22.690 --> 32:23.900
Um...

32:24.400 --> 32:26.653
Sticky and I are roommates.

32:26.736 --> 32:29.864
-We got on-boarded on the same day.
-Hmm.

32:29.948 --> 32:32.241
So, naturally, we're friends.

32:32.742 --> 32:33.993
That's fascinating.

32:34.994 --> 32:36.496
Having a friend?

32:38.456 --> 32:42.752
Hmm. Very good. Ask S.Q. if he wants one.
I'd love to get a green in that kid.

32:43.169 --> 32:45.505
-I'm sorry. Where were we?
-Friends?

32:45.588 --> 32:49.050
Ah! Yes. Brilliant.
Very intuitive. Please.

32:49.968 --> 32:54.681
Um, Reynie,
if I may offer a word of advice.

32:56.474 --> 32:59.769
I might caution you
to not let your guard down with anyone.

33:01.312 --> 33:03.147
This is a very competitive school,

33:03.231 --> 33:06.234
and, um, people's motives
are not always clear at first.

33:08.736 --> 33:09.821
Hmm.

33:10.154 --> 33:11.656
It's quite a life lesson.

33:13.908 --> 33:18.079
I, of course, had to learn it the hard way
when I was your age.

33:18.579 --> 33:21.290
I was betrayed by someone
very close to me.

33:22.375 --> 33:23.960
My brother, if you can believe it.

33:28.214 --> 33:29.507
Your own brother?

33:30.800 --> 33:34.721
Wow, that's horrible.

33:35.138 --> 33:36.305
CURTAIN: Yes.

33:37.598 --> 33:39.600
It was the great tragedy of my life.

33:48.067 --> 33:50.945
Ah. Seems like he's finished now.

33:51.362 --> 33:54.866
No. See? He's thinking.

33:57.910 --> 33:59.662
-Hmm.
-

34:11.257 --> 34:14.260
I have absorbed every dimension
of the problem.

34:23.352 --> 34:24.687
REYNIE: It was very strange.

34:25.229 --> 34:27.482
He's so different
from Mr. Benedict, and yet...

34:27.565 --> 34:29.192
Do you think he suspects us?

34:30.151 --> 34:33.446
I don't think so.
Well, he did ask a lot of questions.

34:33.529 --> 34:35.490
But I can't tell if he's just like that.

34:35.573 --> 34:39.077
Why did they make a salad at the table?
Does it taste better that way?

34:39.660 --> 34:42.830
I don't know. It was very good.

34:43.414 --> 34:45.500
I mean, I can see why
everybody in here likes him.

34:45.583 --> 34:48.252
But there's something about him
that I just don't trust.

34:48.836 --> 34:52.173
-Besides the limited menu?
-And the brain sweeping?

34:52.256 --> 34:55.968
He was making notes in this journal.
If we can somehow read that...

34:56.052 --> 35:00.932
What about Mr. Benedict betraying him?
What if he betrays us, too?

35:01.015 --> 35:04.769
-Mr. Benedict would never do that.
-Everyone has a price.

35:05.520 --> 35:07.647
Mr. Benedict is a good man.

35:11.359 --> 35:15.154
-You see the Shoguns match last night?
-What a disaster.

35:15.238 --> 35:18.825
You're going against Rodriguez,
the best hole-set to play the game,

35:18.908 --> 35:20.243
and you're playing her man-to-man?

35:20.326 --> 35:22.537
-WOMAN 2: You gotta work the M-drop.
-

35:22.620 --> 35:26.165
You run the M-drop, slough the drivers,
and double team the hole-set.

35:26.249 --> 35:29.961
A baby knows this.
And don't get me started about Davids.

35:30.044 --> 35:33.965
-WOMAN 2: Oh, please. Go on.
-MAN 3: Let me break it down for you.

35:40.680 --> 35:43.057
-There's a lot here.
-What?

35:43.933 --> 35:47.436
They believe that Curtain
has a way of erasing the memories

35:47.520 --> 35:48.646
of those who cross him.

35:48.729 --> 35:51.023
-And that may explain...
-What happened to Milligan.

35:51.107 --> 35:52.400
Poor thing! Poor...

35:52.483 --> 35:55.945
There's more. Kate and Constance,
they're struggling.

35:56.028 --> 35:57.655
-What?
-It's not good.

35:57.738 --> 35:59.699
There is no room for error.

35:59.782 --> 36:04.036
Failure is much more than exile.
Now, if the girls get kicked out...

36:04.120 --> 36:05.746
It's too much. It's too much.

36:05.830 --> 36:08.082
With what we know now,
we've put them in way too deep.

36:08.166 --> 36:09.333
Way too deep.

36:09.417 --> 36:11.460
RHONDA: But we knew
it was going to be dangerous.

36:11.544 --> 36:15.673
And, like you said, they are
in more danger if they don't stop Curtain.

36:15.965 --> 36:17.091
We all are.

36:18.342 --> 36:20.887
They're remarkable kids.
That's why you chose them.

36:20.970 --> 36:23.931
-That's why they accepted.
-Yes.

36:25.016 --> 36:27.685
Which is why we cannot let them fail.

36:30.688 --> 36:33.608
Sadly, there's only one option
and they're not gonna like it.

36:34.942 --> 36:36.152
I don't like it.

36:47.705 --> 36:53.669
STICKY: "Become what you are not."

36:53.753 --> 36:56.839
-KATE: What does that mean?
-I wish he would speak clearly.

36:56.923 --> 37:00.343
Wait, hold on. He's talking about
doing well in class.

37:00.927 --> 37:04.263
So he wants us
to be something we're not in school.

37:04.347 --> 37:05.306
Teacher?

37:05.389 --> 37:07.058
-Bad student?
-Disruptive?

37:07.141 --> 37:08.226
Pencil sharpener?

37:09.185 --> 37:12.730
Dishonest. He wants us to cheat.

37:13.731 --> 37:19.237
-No. He wouldn't do that.
-According to Curtain, he would.

37:19.320 --> 37:21.280
-I don't think so.
-Ask him.

37:33.459 --> 37:36.003
It says, "Don't...

37:40.633 --> 37:42.927
get caught."

37:54.355 --> 37:56.232
-MAN 3: Almost done?
-WOMAN 2: Oh, no.

37:56.315 --> 37:58.234
I left my T1 wrench at the shop.

37:58.317 --> 38:00.611
You wanna stay here
and watch the tools while I go get it?

38:00.695 --> 38:02.863
-MAN 3: Sure.
-WOMAN 2: Should I pick up some food, too?

38:02.947 --> 38:04.198
Make this a working dinner?

38:04.282 --> 38:06.033
MAN 3: I got nowhere to be.
Let's settle in.

38:17.211 --> 38:18.838
Is that the island?

38:19.463 --> 38:22.883
-Do you ever sleep?
-Why make this?

38:22.967 --> 38:24.885
I'm not just gonna wait around
to get barged.

38:25.469 --> 38:29.473
Our mission is to find the transmitter,
not take dumb tests.

38:29.557 --> 38:31.851
You didn't really answer my question.

38:31.934 --> 38:34.437
The transmitter's got to be in the Tower,

38:34.520 --> 38:37.148
but there are no doors
to get equipment in through.

38:37.231 --> 38:39.650
KATE: How do they get the big transmitters
in and out?

38:39.734 --> 38:41.319
There's got to be a loading bay.

38:44.488 --> 38:46.574
This inlet's close to the Tower.

38:46.657 --> 38:50.661
It's shielded from the currents,
and not easily visible from the mainland.

38:51.162 --> 38:55.082
-If I were building a loading bay...
-Huh. You're kind of making sense.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.377
-Strange.
-That's my destiny.

38:59.462 --> 39:01.130
We're gonna dance.

39:04.550 --> 39:05.718
CONSTANCE: Let's go.

39:06.927 --> 39:08.012
Oh.

39:09.221 --> 39:11.098
I guess you're coming.

39:15.311 --> 39:16.437
This way.

39:18.606 --> 39:21.567
The inlet should be right down...

39:21.650 --> 39:22.735
...there!

39:24.153 --> 39:26.405
CONSTANCE:
What the heck are they doing down there?

39:27.114 --> 39:29.116
KATE: They're working underwater?

39:29.742 --> 39:32.703
Hey! What are you two doing out?

39:33.537 --> 39:36.624
We couldn't sleep.
We thought a brisk walk might help.

39:36.707 --> 39:39.460
And you're off the pathway.
You need to come with us.

39:39.543 --> 39:43.381
Don't. She has bursitis.

39:45.132 --> 39:46.258
It's gross.

39:47.385 --> 39:49.053
And contagious.

39:52.681 --> 39:55.476
Well, you're not supposed
to be out this late.

39:55.559 --> 39:57.853
JILLSON: Back to your rooms.
We're watching.

39:58.145 --> 40:00.815
And if we find you out again, full report.

40:09.365 --> 40:11.158
-

40:11.242 --> 40:12.785
Oh, thank goodness.

40:15.538 --> 40:16.622
You made it.

40:16.705 --> 40:19.583
-Was there any trouble?
-Just a short delay.

40:20.459 --> 40:24.004
Thank you, Milligan.
I will make good on this debt.

40:24.463 --> 40:27.049
-Bit of a first aid situation here...
-On it.

40:42.273 --> 40:43.566
Well, this will hurt.

40:43.983 --> 40:44.942
What?

40:53.284 --> 40:54.326
RHONDA: Sir.

40:56.245 --> 40:57.496
I...

40:58.789 --> 41:04.295
I wonder if this new knowledge
of Curtain's identity

41:04.378 --> 41:07.631
changes anything for us or you.

41:10.843 --> 41:13.304
-Will you be able to...
-Nothing changes.

41:13.387 --> 41:15.055
BENEDICT: He's my responsibility.

41:15.514 --> 41:17.266
And I'm the only one who can stop him.

41:22.271 --> 41:25.357
There we go. Watch the nose cone, now.

41:26.358 --> 41:27.485
CURTAIN: Nice.

41:31.071 --> 41:35.201
Oh, S.Q., why don't you go sketch
for a little bit, hmm?

41:35.826 --> 41:36.911
Thank you.

41:42.374 --> 41:43.334
Yes?

41:43.959 --> 41:44.877
As you know,

41:44.960 --> 41:48.380
the amplification-slash-modulation routine
is less than perfect,

41:48.464 --> 41:51.217
but I'm planning on leaning on
a pure burst modality that will,

41:51.300 --> 41:52.968
at the very least, isolate the variables.

41:53.052 --> 41:55.554
Oh, 100 percent. Those variables.

41:58.140 --> 42:00.309
I'm never sure
you're actually listening to me.

42:00.392 --> 42:03.687
Dr. Garrison. Friend.
Please, don't say that.

42:03.771 --> 42:06.398
I am focused.
Your passions are my passions.

42:06.482 --> 42:08.025
Your interests are my interests.

42:08.108 --> 42:11.237
I am fascinated by the science.

42:12.530 --> 42:15.866
Thank you. I work very hard at all this.

42:15.950 --> 42:17.159
I know you do.

42:17.826 --> 42:21.247
As I was saying,
the process is extremely unstable, but...

42:21.330 --> 42:23.415
Well, I'm fascinated, but...

42:23.499 --> 42:24.792
...but with time...

42:24.875 --> 42:26.418
We have a timetable issue.

42:28.045 --> 42:29.380
What happened?

42:32.007 --> 42:35.678
Our move to contain
my brother has failed. I...

42:36.470 --> 42:38.347
He's still out there. That's a concern.

42:39.932 --> 42:41.809
-Not my problem. I'm an engineer.
-Of course.

42:41.892 --> 42:43.936
-Operations is a separate department.
-Yeah.

42:44.436 --> 42:46.313
-It's called "Operations".
-Mm-hmm.

42:46.814 --> 42:50.067
This means we have to begin
testing our endgame immediately.

42:50.651 --> 42:54.280
The table has been perfectly set.
Now, we just have to serve.

42:55.656 --> 42:59.618
Well, I understand the urgency.
We're not ready yet.

42:59.702 --> 43:01.870
You can't just flip a switch.

43:01.954 --> 43:04.707
The power supply has to deliver
within a very narrow set of valences,

43:04.790 --> 43:07.585
and we're only now developing
the protocols to even estimate a baseline.

43:08.002 --> 43:12.339
Right. Right. Of course.
But one more time,

43:12.423 --> 43:15.551
everything after you just said "switch".

43:18.804 --> 43:20.389
I'll do the best I can.

43:21.181 --> 43:24.184
Remember, Dr. Garrison,
power wants to be free.

43:25.477 --> 43:28.689
-So, free it.
-Okay.

43:28.772 --> 43:30.566
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

43:30.649 --> 43:31.775
Thank you.

43:34.737 --> 43:35.654
All right.

43:39.199 --> 43:43.203
REYNIE: Dear Ms. Perumal, I really wish
I could talk to you right now.

43:44.496 --> 43:46.582
You were always so calm, and...

43:47.291 --> 43:48.917
I've never been more scared in my life.

43:50.085 --> 43:51.795
Did I make a mistake coming here?

43:53.380 --> 43:57.426
I know it's important, but I don't know
if I can do what's being asked of me.

43:59.553 --> 44:06.268
MAN 1: Market.
To free the pain. Poison apples...

44:06.352 --> 44:08.270
REYNIE: I trust Mr. Benedict,

44:08.354 --> 44:11.607
and I trust that everything we're doing
is for a good cause.

44:12.733 --> 44:14.234
But it's all upside down.

44:14.693 --> 44:16.737
I don't know
if I'm the right person for this.

44:17.780 --> 44:22.743
I miss you. I wish I was sitting
across from you with a hot cup of tea.

44:23.702 --> 44:25.746
You always have the perfect advice.

44:27.122 --> 44:29.583
I'm a little worried about you,
with all that's going on.

44:30.584 --> 44:32.002
I hope you're doing well.

44:32.503 --> 44:36.423
I hope you still think of me sometimes.

44:37.966 --> 44:41.095
Love, Reynie. Muldoon.

44:41.178 --> 44:44.181
Muldoon. M-U-L-D-O-O-N.

44:44.264 --> 44:47.935
-Reynard Muldoon.
-MAN 4: Ma'am, I'm sorry...

44:48.018 --> 44:49.770
This is the Boatwright Academy, isn't it?

44:49.853 --> 44:55.192
It is, but our policy states that we are
not allowed to disclose any information

44:55.275 --> 44:58.237
about our students to non-family members.

44:58.320 --> 45:02.366
Be that as it may,
I sent a package to one of your students.

45:02.449 --> 45:04.201
Why was it returned?

45:05.661 --> 45:08.831
-I have no idea.
-He is a student there, is he not?

45:09.748 --> 45:13.335
Ma'am, there's no Reynard Muldoon
enrolled here.

45:14.128 --> 45:15.546
There must be a mistake.

45:15.629 --> 45:18.549
Tell your headmaster that I'm on my way
to talk to her in person.
