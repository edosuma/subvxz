Okay, well, if she's a high level Neo,

09:34.116 --> 09:36.035
won't she know what a clone looks like?

09:37.119 --> 09:38.996
(SIGHS)

09:39.080 --> 09:40.456
Just blend.

09:40.957 --> 09:42.333
(DONNIE SIGHS)

09:42.416 --> 09:43.626
I need to find the lab.

09:43.709 --> 09:44.919
How?

09:47.129 --> 09:48.129
Hello.

09:48.172 --> 09:49.572
Is this your first Brightborn baby?

09:49.674 --> 09:51.342
- Mmm-hmm.
- (STAMMERS) Yeah.

09:51.425 --> 09:54.428
My son Georgie is two now

09:54.512 --> 09:56.806
and he is just perfect.

09:57.807 --> 09:59.475
DONNIE: Oh, yeah.
WOMAN: Yeah.

09:59.558 --> 10:00.661
EVIE: Good afternoon, everyone.

10:00.685 --> 10:01.769
WOMAN: (GASPS)There's Evie.

10:01.852 --> 10:04.438
- (ALL CLAPPING)
- I love her.

10:06.023 --> 10:08.067
EVIE: (CHUCKLING) Thank you.

10:09.193 --> 10:11.779
So, why are we all here?

10:12.071 --> 10:14.282
Uh, peace of mind, personally.

10:14.365 --> 10:16.826
All due respect to natural childbirth.
(CHUCKLES)

10:16.909 --> 10:19.203
Yes, nature can be cruel.

10:19.287 --> 10:22.081
When my parents
rolled their genetic dice,

10:22.164 --> 10:24.125
a single mutation turned me into

10:24.208 --> 10:26.127
"The girl in the plastic bubble."

10:27.753 --> 10:30.756
My immune system
was severely compromised,

10:30.840 --> 10:32.591
a condition known as SCID.

10:33.050 --> 10:34.370
Severe combined immunodeficiency.

10:34.427 --> 10:35.970
EVIE: I had pneumonia eight times.

10:36.053 --> 10:37.513
I had a bone marrow transplant.

10:37.805 --> 10:41.225
The doctors told us this was my life.

10:41.600 --> 10:45.563
But the Chos are a fierce
and stubborn family.

10:45.896 --> 10:47.732
My parents,

10:47.815 --> 10:53.195
they lobbied, researched,
and mortgaged our home to keep going.

10:54.655 --> 10:59.118
In 1994, I entered
an experimental gene therapy trial.

11:00.036 --> 11:02.038
By the time I graduated
from bioengineering,

11:02.121 --> 11:03.914
I was in full remission,

11:04.206 --> 11:08.252
and as an engineer,
when I see a flaw, I wanna fix it.

11:10.588 --> 11:13.424
First position, heels together.

11:13.507 --> 11:17.303
Very nice. Perfect. That is so good!

11:17.720 --> 11:19.040
Aren't you a bit tall for ballet?

11:19.138 --> 11:21.140
Ha! Puberty was a real heartbreak.

11:21.223 --> 11:22.558
- (FELIX CHUCKLES)
- ADELE: Okay.

11:23.309 --> 11:25.394
Now, think of your hips
as a bowl of fruit.

11:25.478 --> 11:28.230
So, you don't wanna tilt one
side or the other too much,

11:28.314 --> 11:31.275
'cause then your
grapes are gonna go fallin' out, right?

11:31.359 --> 11:35.029
All right, so, second position.
You remember it?

11:35.446 --> 11:38.074
Yeah! And, beautiful.

11:38.157 --> 11:39.950
Oh, my gosh, you are so good!

11:40.242 --> 11:42.411
Mmm. Mmm.

11:43.162 --> 11:45.664
You are a very talented dancer.

11:45.748 --> 11:47.148
- KIRA: Thank you.
- You're welcome.

11:47.208 --> 11:49.168
Is that why you're always traveling?
You on tour?

11:49.251 --> 11:51.670
KIRA: I went to go live in Iceland
with my granny.

11:52.046 --> 11:54.840
In Iceland? Wow!

11:54.924 --> 11:56.675
I thought your foster family was Irish.

11:56.759 --> 11:59.178
Yeah, yeah, Irish travelers,
so no fixed address.

11:59.261 --> 12:01.615
ADELE: Do you know how to dance
like an Irish traveler, huh?

12:01.639 --> 12:03.682
(LAUGHING) I don't know.

12:03.766 --> 12:04.975
Uh, Kira, we gotta go.

12:05.476 --> 12:06.560
- ADELE: Aw!
- Already?

12:07.186 --> 12:10.314
SARAH: Gonna go see Scottie.
Check out some comics!

12:10.398 --> 12:11.982
(CHUCKLES)

12:12.066 --> 12:13.401
Yeah?

12:13.484 --> 12:15.069
Good. Sorry, big day.

12:15.152 --> 12:17.029
KIRA: Bye.
ADELE: Bye.

12:28.207 --> 12:29.333
WOMAN: Oh, my God.

12:30.167 --> 12:31.460
I'm late. (CHUCKLES)

12:31.544 --> 12:32.920
I'm late for my own pregnancy.

12:33.003 --> 12:34.255
That's fine.

12:34.338 --> 12:35.548
Your name, please?

12:35.631 --> 12:36.715
Christine Wingham.

12:38.134 --> 12:40.428
I have heard so much about you guys.

12:40.511 --> 12:44.223
I am so excited about my own
little Brightborn baby.

12:46.016 --> 12:49.103
EVIE: So, what makes
a Brightborn baby different?

12:49.478 --> 12:51.522
And why is it so expensive?

12:51.605 --> 12:55.359
The fees aren't
just for five-star services.

12:55.443 --> 12:56.944
They fund research.

12:57.611 --> 13:00.489
Our exclusive technology

13:00.573 --> 13:04.243
identifies and enhances
your most viable embryos.

13:04.326 --> 13:05.828
Enhances your embryos how?

13:05.911 --> 13:08.247
(WHISPERING) I have no idea,
I'm very lost.

13:08.372 --> 13:10.332
EVIE: Brightborn can
actually help you do that.

13:10.416 --> 13:12.001
And that is my cue.

13:12.084 --> 13:14.712
- Again, welcome to Brightborn.

Blue, stay put. Hey.

13:28.684 --> 13:30.484
We're gonna talk
about pre and postnatal care.

13:30.561 --> 13:32.855
And I'll be able to answer
any of your questions.

13:32.938 --> 13:35.065
(WHISPERS) I'm gonna snoop around.

13:35.191 --> 13:37.485
- DONNIE: Hey. Be careful.
- Find the lab, okay?

13:37.568 --> 13:39.653
CHRISTINE: Legitimately signing
my life away here.

13:39.737 --> 13:42.323
This is a lot of paperwork. (CHUCKLES)

13:42.406 --> 13:44.366
I'm just kidding, but I'm willing

13:44.492 --> 13:46.452
to make that sacrifice, you know?

13:49.747 --> 13:51.582
As a mother, it's worth it.

13:52.583 --> 13:55.711
Susan, welcome.

13:55.794 --> 13:59.131
Evie, such a beautiful facility
you've built here.

13:59.215 --> 14:00.508
Ira loves the pool.

14:00.591 --> 14:01.884
Yes.

14:01.967 --> 14:04.178
I didn't know you were coming too, Ira.

14:04.261 --> 14:07.806
The incident at your dental clinic
is all of our concern.

14:07.932 --> 14:10.412
It was Sarah Manning and her people
who killed your technician.

14:10.476 --> 14:12.645
Which is what I wanna tell you, Susan,

14:12.728 --> 14:14.813
I think your runaway clone is here.

14:16.148 --> 14:18.025
Sarah Manning's at Brightborn?

14:18.108 --> 14:20.528
EVIE: I saw her conning
her way into orientation.

14:20.611 --> 14:21.862
I'll get Roxie to pick her up.

14:21.946 --> 14:23.113
Not yet!

14:25.908 --> 14:27.910
Let me see her first.

14:31.747 --> 14:34.917
WOMAN: Nothing!
No jaundice, no colic.

14:35.209 --> 14:38.671
He sleeps well. Latched right away.

14:38.754 --> 14:40.631
I gotta say, I get a little... (SIGHS)

14:40.798 --> 14:42.633
...choked up when I come back here.

14:42.758 --> 14:44.468

14:44.593 --> 14:47.012
(EXHALES) We were ready to adopt and...

14:47.137 --> 14:50.099
And I'm sure our family
would have been full of love,

14:50.182 --> 14:53.435
but wanting a baby,
it's a natural urge.

14:53.519 --> 14:55.563
DR. BOSCH: Not just an urge,
it's an imperative.

14:55.646 --> 14:58.607
Every living species
seeks to propagate.

14:58.691 --> 15:02.111
Our genes have a selfish drive
to multiply.

15:03.654 --> 15:05.114
Would you like to hold him?

Do you, um...

16:48.217 --> 16:49.927
Do you know who this is?

16:51.428 --> 16:52.763
It says she's Alison Hendrix.

16:53.055 --> 16:54.264
(CHUCKLES)

16:54.848 --> 16:57.393
Uncanny, right? How much

16:57.893 --> 17:00.604
she looks like Beth.

17:07.944 --> 17:11.615
- I don't see it.
- And you maintain that position.

17:11.740 --> 17:14.535
You don't wanna go sticking
your neck out for the Hendrixes.

17:14.617 --> 17:16.453
And why's that?

17:16.537 --> 17:17.954
Detectives Collier and Lindstein,

17:18.038 --> 17:20.207
they have them
on the Pouchy-Pozinho thing.

a move on Pouchy's pills.

17:26.296 --> 17:27.548
And you know what?

17:27.923 --> 17:31.176
They sold the drugs
through a soap store.

17:31.635 --> 17:33.387
Bubble bath and shit.

17:33.929 --> 17:35.139

you were trying to offload
a kilo of cocaine!

Did Art mention Helena?

20:05.622 --> 20:06.623
(LINE DISCONNECTS)

20:06.707 --> 20:08.667
- Hello?
- Bitch.

20:08.750 --> 20:10.127
Bitch.

20:21.221 --> 20:22.347
Is this seat taken?

20:30.022 --> 20:31.982
Oh, don't stop reading on my account.

20:32.065 --> 20:34.192
We encourage our clients to be diligent.

20:34.276 --> 20:36.194
Did you have any questions
I might answer?

20:36.278 --> 20:38.113
I'm Susan, by the way.

20:39.406 --> 20:40.908
Ava. Hi.

20:40.991 --> 20:43.493
Uh, I'm not a lawyer
or anything, but...

20:43.577 --> 20:47.497
(STAMMERS) I just noticed
that under, um,

20:47.581 --> 20:48.957
cryopreservation...

20:49.041 --> 20:52.502
"Written notice within 36 months
of any remaining embryos."

20:52.586 --> 20:54.063
So does that mean
that if I don't notify,

20:54.087 --> 20:56.381
my embryos just become
property of Brightborn?

20:56.465 --> 20:58.008
You can't own an embryo.

20:58.342 --> 21:00.135
They're donated, for research.

21:01.511 --> 21:03.055
What kind of research, exactly?

21:03.347 --> 21:04.947
Oh, it's all rather technical, actually.

21:05.307 --> 21:06.683
- COSIMA: Oh, sorry.
- Oh!

21:08.477 --> 21:12.856
(CLEARS THROAT) I'm a...
I was a biology major.

21:12.940 --> 21:15.233
So I noticed
that in all of the pictures...

21:15.317 --> 21:16.902
Thank you, by the way. (CHUCKLES)

21:16.985 --> 21:18.695
Uh, the babies have dimples.

21:19.029 --> 21:23.408
It's highly unlikely for that
to express itself in every child.

21:23.492 --> 21:27.955
Perhaps babies with dimples
are more likely to be photographed.

21:30.666 --> 21:32.376
So it's my confirmation bias, then.

21:32.459 --> 21:33.835
- Perhaps.
- Right.

21:34.544 --> 21:36.213
When you say embryonic enhancements,

21:36.296 --> 21:37.881
what exactly is that referring to?

21:37.965 --> 21:41.176
Is that mitochondrial transfer, or...

21:41.259 --> 21:43.136
We have been very successful
at eliminating

21:43.220 --> 21:45.222
certain genetic risk factors.

21:45.305 --> 21:47.516
There's some kind
of screening process, then?

21:47.599 --> 21:49.768
Our technique is more direct.

21:50.686 --> 21:52.354
You don't mean germline editing?

21:52.437 --> 21:54.606
Altering the DNA of...

21:54.690 --> 21:56.692
(SCOFFS)...an embryo is very risky.

21:56.775 --> 21:59.653
Any mistake and that mutation
is passed on to future generations.

21:59.736 --> 22:03.448
And that is why germline editing
is illegal in most countries.

22:06.576 --> 22:08.036
- KIRA: Mum!
- What?

22:08.120 --> 22:09.871
I tell you about my dreams sometimes.

22:09.955 --> 22:11.540
It's not like that.

22:11.623 --> 22:13.709
What's it like, then?

22:13.792 --> 22:15.836
Do you wanna talk to S about it instead?

22:18.672 --> 22:19.798

22:19.881 --> 22:22.175
Oh, hiya, Pumpkin. (CHUCKLES)

22:22.384 --> 22:25.470

22:28.098 --> 22:30.600

Oh, um, Sarah...

22:30.684 --> 22:32.310
Okay, earmuffs. (CHUCKLES)

22:32.394 --> 22:35.188
Um, Felix told me
about your little immigration issues.

22:35.272 --> 22:37.190
I just wanted to say, I never was

22:37.274 --> 22:39.234

22:39.317 --> 22:42.738

A word, please.

22:59.588 --> 23:00.756

23:02.340 --> 23:03.467

23:17.314 --> 23:18.541
- I'm going up to the lab.
- Great. Listen to me!

23:18.565 --> 23:20.150
(WHISPERS) There's another clone here.

23:34.164 --> 23:35.582

MRS. S: Hey! Hey!
SARAH:...that we need a safe house.

23:47.135 --> 23:48.720
You agreed not to bring her here,

23:48.804 --> 23:50.324
and then you just walked her right in.

23:50.388 --> 23:51.723
SARAH: It's a safe house, Fee.

23:51.807 --> 23:53.100
You're paranoid.

The two of you, you're bloody paranoid.

23:54.434 --> 23:55.560
SARAH: Kira's here.

23:55.644 --> 23:57.687

suspicious of Adele.

24:00.816 --> 24:02.442
