WEBVTT

00:03.177 --> 00:04.743
- Where are we?

00:05.918 --> 00:08.051
- At the Dawn of Time.

00:11.707 --> 00:12.708
- Ah!

00:15.276 --> 00:16.668
- Well,
look who's finally...

00:16.712 --> 00:18.496
- Ah!

00:18.540 --> 00:20.759
- Awake.
- Alex.

00:20.803 --> 00:22.413
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

00:22.457 --> 00:23.849
- No, no, no, it's okay.
It's okay.

00:23.893 --> 00:26.287
Are you okay?
Did you have a bad dream?

00:26.330 --> 00:28.724
- I don't know.
I'm--

00:28.767 --> 00:30.987
How did I get here?

00:31.031 --> 00:33.511
- Well, you fell asleep
in front of the TV,

00:33.555 --> 00:35.165
and you just looked
so peaceful,

00:35.209 --> 00:37.298
so I didn't have the heart
to move you to the bed.

00:37.341 --> 00:40.431
The--the Dawn of Time.

00:40.475 --> 00:42.346
Dawn of Time.

00:42.390 --> 00:44.087
- Is that what you were
watching before you nodded off?

00:44.131 --> 00:47.482
- Wait.
What is--

00:48.570 --> 00:50.137
This isn't right.

00:50.180 --> 00:51.703
Well, I mean, it's right,
but it's not right

00:51.747 --> 00:53.444
because it's right.
- Uh-huh.

00:53.488 --> 00:55.490
I see the White Martian
did a number on you last night.

00:55.533 --> 00:56.708
- White Martian?

00:56.752 --> 00:58.580
White Martian.

00:58.623 --> 01:00.321
- Listen, I gotta run.

01:00.364 --> 01:01.670
Kelly and I are trying out
a new indoor rowing class

01:01.713 --> 01:05.587
in downtown, so are you--you
sure you're okay?

01:05.630 --> 01:07.502
- I'm fine.

01:07.545 --> 01:09.504
I'm fine.

01:09.547 --> 01:10.548
- Okay.

01:12.724 --> 01:15.292
- Alex.
- Yeah?

01:15.336 --> 01:17.251
- I love you.

01:17.294 --> 01:18.948
- I love you too.

01:25.259 --> 01:26.303
Nia.
- Kara.

01:26.347 --> 01:28.000
- It's good to hear your voice.

01:28.044 --> 01:29.698
- Well, it would be better
to see my face.

01:29.741 --> 01:31.830
Where are you?
The ceremony's about to start.

01:31.874 --> 01:32.831
- Ceremony?

01:32.875 --> 01:34.311
- They're awarding

01:34.355 --> 01:35.486
the Nobel Peace Prize
any minute.

01:35.530 --> 01:37.532
Don't worry,
I saved you a seat,

01:37.575 --> 01:40.796
but that lady from the gazette
is giving me angry eyes.

01:42.363 --> 01:44.278
If you miss this,
Andrea's gonna blow a gasket.

01:45.322 --> 01:46.541
- Please take your seats.

01:46.584 --> 01:48.499
- Good timing.

01:48.543 --> 01:51.198
Hey, uh, I had a really weird
dream last night.

01:51.241 --> 01:53.374
Could you maybe help me
interpret it?

01:53.417 --> 01:55.071
- What happened?

01:55.115 --> 01:58.379
- Oh, uh, the world ended,
but, like, all the worlds.

01:59.858 --> 02:01.382
All of them.

02:01.425 --> 02:03.993
- That's dramatic even for us.

02:05.429 --> 02:07.344
- And now I'm proud
to introduce the winner

02:07.388 --> 02:09.346
of this year's
Nobel Peace Prize,

02:09.390 --> 02:10.347
Lex Luthor.

02:16.397 --> 02:19.574
- Nia, Nia,
am I still dreaming?

02:19.617 --> 02:21.358
- I know, right.

02:21.402 --> 02:22.794
It is so great when this award
goes to someone

02:22.838 --> 02:24.405
who actually deserves it.

02:38.854 --> 02:42.205
- We live in dangerous times.

02:42.249 --> 02:45.426
Earth is a dangerous place.

02:45.469 --> 02:49.299
I suppose that's why people
love superheroes so much.

02:49.343 --> 02:53.216
The power, the chutzpah
of someone who can

02:53.260 --> 02:55.871
fly faster
than a speeding bullet.

02:57.307 --> 03:00.876
But that's what makes this
so special.

03:00.919 --> 03:02.399
I don't have any powers.

03:02.443 --> 03:05.097
I can't leap tall buildings
in a single bound,

03:05.141 --> 03:08.666
but I have dedicated my life
to fighting

03:08.710 --> 03:12.279
on the side of humanity,
and to be recognized for that

03:12.322 --> 03:14.411
is more than I can
put into words,

03:14.455 --> 03:17.240
so I will just say

03:17.284 --> 03:19.938
I stand with mankind.

03:25.335 --> 03:27.250
- I'm gonna throw up.

03:27.294 --> 03:28.686
- Are you still feeling weird?

03:28.730 --> 03:30.035
We should get you
to the med bay.

03:30.079 --> 03:31.515
You did not seem okay
this morning.

03:31.559 --> 03:33.474
- Oh, no, no, I'm fine.
I'm just disoriented.

03:33.517 --> 03:37.695
The world is--what was Lex
doing up there?

03:37.739 --> 03:39.697
- Well, they keep throwing
all these awards at him.

03:39.741 --> 03:41.308
He doesn't usually
accept them in person,

03:41.351 --> 03:42.874
but this one
meant a lot to him.

03:42.918 --> 03:44.659
- People think he's a good guy?

03:44.702 --> 03:47.270
- Kara, we're talking about
Lex Luther.

03:47.314 --> 03:48.619
He's the best guy.

03:48.663 --> 03:51.448
- No, he's not.
He's a psychopathic lunatic.

03:51.492 --> 03:54.625
- What?
No, he's the boss.

03:54.669 --> 03:56.888
And he's your
number one supporter.

03:56.932 --> 03:58.542
I mean, besides Lena.

03:58.586 --> 04:00.936
And all the times that they
defended you to the president--

04:00.979 --> 04:02.329
what has gotten into you.

04:03.591 --> 04:06.768
- Hang on, what-wha--wait,
did you just say "boss"?

04:12.817 --> 04:14.515
I don't--

04:14.558 --> 04:16.865
Oh, no, no, no, no.

04:16.908 --> 04:19.520
Alex, are we--

04:19.563 --> 04:20.651
- Supergirl.

04:20.695 --> 04:21.957
- J'onn.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.785
- I know you must be confused.

04:23.828 --> 04:26.788
I was too, but it happened.

04:26.831 --> 04:29.791
It all happened.

04:29.834 --> 04:31.662
- Why are we the only two
that remember?

04:31.706 --> 04:33.360
- What are we
that they are not?

04:33.403 --> 04:35.318
- Paragons.

04:35.362 --> 04:37.320
We helped Oliver
restart the universe.

04:37.364 --> 04:40.584
- And this is the result.

04:40.628 --> 04:42.456
I suspect there will be
more such changes

04:42.499 --> 04:44.327
that are yet
to reveal themselves.

04:45.981 --> 04:47.548
- Well, there's something
happening downtown.

04:47.591 --> 04:49.550
- I'll send a team.
- No, no, no, it's fine.

04:49.593 --> 04:51.378
I need to punch something.

05:08.177 --> 05:09.178
- Hey.

05:11.006 --> 05:12.747
- Look who came
to join the fun.

05:12.790 --> 05:14.966
- I'm sorry.
Who are you?

05:15.010 --> 05:16.925
- Weather Witch.

05:16.968 --> 05:19.580
And you are no match
for my wrath.

05:21.495 --> 05:24.367
- Oh, look, I'm having
not so great a day,

05:24.411 --> 05:25.542
which is actually
your bad luck.

05:26.674 --> 05:27.631
- Ugh.

05:27.675 --> 05:28.806
Ah!

05:30.417 --> 05:32.375
- Sorry, she's one of mine.

05:32.419 --> 05:34.638
- Well, what's she doing
on my Earth?

05:34.682 --> 05:36.379
- What?

05:36.423 --> 05:38.773
- Wait, wait, what are
you doing on my Earth?

05:38.816 --> 05:42.080
Your Earth?
This is my Earth.

05:42.124 --> 05:43.778
- I thought--
- I thought--

05:45.562 --> 05:49.610
- Supergirl, Flash, I just
love it when you guys team up.

05:49.653 --> 05:52.439
Would you sign this
for me please?

05:52.482 --> 05:56.007
- Oh, sure, um--
- Wait, you know both of us?

05:56.051 --> 05:59.228
- And it's normal to see
us together?

05:59.271 --> 06:00.969
- Well, normally
you'd also have

06:01.012 --> 06:02.753
Green Arrow
and a Legend or two.

06:02.797 --> 06:04.625
Last year,
even Batwoman joined in.

06:04.668 --> 06:07.628
Make that out to Marv.
M-A-R-V.

06:07.671 --> 06:08.977
- Thank you.
- Marv, M-A-R-V.

06:09.020 --> 06:10.631
You're welcome.

06:10.674 --> 06:13.242
Marv, as far as you know,
how long have Supergirl and I

06:13.285 --> 06:17.289
and all the rest of us
been working together

06:17.333 --> 06:19.814
on this Earth?

06:19.857 --> 06:22.033
- Uh, since forever?

06:42.532 --> 06:43.490
- The hell?

06:49.757 --> 06:52.107
Call for help.
Now!

07:09.994 --> 07:11.561
- How did I get back here?

07:25.009 --> 07:26.533
Ray, where are you?

07:28.709 --> 07:31.494
- Hey, Cap, over here.
- Ray.

07:31.538 --> 07:33.670
Hey, hey.

07:33.714 --> 07:35.585
- Hey, you okay?

07:35.629 --> 07:37.326
Not that I'm ever one
to question a hug.

07:37.369 --> 07:38.849
- What was the last thing
that you remember?

07:38.893 --> 07:41.722
- Uh, portaling to this
location on your orders.

07:41.765 --> 07:44.594
- You don't remember coming
here for trivia night

07:44.638 --> 07:47.205
and being teleported
to an alternate Waverider

07:47.249 --> 07:48.990
to stop the multiverse
from being destroyed?

07:49.033 --> 07:50.731
- Wait, was there a crossover?

07:50.774 --> 07:52.689
Were we invited?
Did we win?

07:52.733 --> 07:54.735
- That's certainly
how it looks.

07:54.778 --> 07:55.779
- Did you just hear--

07:58.565 --> 08:00.218
- It's good to see
you're both safe.

08:00.262 --> 08:02.656
- J'onn, that's a neat trick.

08:02.699 --> 08:05.746
- Wait, you know J'onn Jonnz
from Supergirl's Earth?

08:05.789 --> 08:06.921
- Of course I know J'onn.

08:06.964 --> 08:08.749
- Wait, go back.

08:08.792 --> 08:10.751
Supergirl has her own Earth?

08:10.794 --> 08:12.492
- Not anymore.

08:13.580 --> 08:16.713
When we restarted the universe,
our worlds combined,

08:16.757 --> 08:19.368
and only we Paragons know
it was ever any different.

08:20.587 --> 08:22.197
- Okay, sorry, guy,
I'm a little lost here.

08:22.240 --> 08:24.068
- Here, this'll be faster.

08:28.072 --> 08:31.380
- Whoa, there was a multiverse.

08:31.423 --> 08:32.555
It all got destroyed.

08:32.599 --> 08:33.600
There's an evil Batman,

08:33.643 --> 08:35.558
and there's a me
that's a super me?

08:35.602 --> 08:36.777
- It'll take him some time

08:36.820 --> 08:38.169
to assimilate
to this new paradigm.

08:38.213 --> 08:40.041
I have been going
from city to city

08:40.084 --> 08:42.913
restoring the memories of
our compatriots as best I can.

08:42.957 --> 08:44.567
- And what about Oliver?

08:45.829 --> 08:47.744
- There's been no sign of him.

08:50.704 --> 08:51.748
- Hey, where are you going?

08:51.792 --> 08:53.620
- To find my friend.

08:57.972 --> 08:58.973
Oliver!

09:03.455 --> 09:04.544
Oliver!

09:17.426 --> 09:18.427
- Sara.

09:20.647 --> 09:21.996
- I need to talk to you guys--

09:22.039 --> 09:23.040
- We already know.

09:24.781 --> 09:26.696
We already know.

09:26.740 --> 09:28.002
- Martian J'onn came by

09:28.045 --> 09:30.091
and gave us
a splitting headache.

09:31.875 --> 09:33.660
- It all happened, didn't it?

09:35.836 --> 09:37.751
- He died twice, Sara.

09:37.794 --> 09:40.667
Yeah.

09:40.710 --> 09:44.584
- I wasn't there both times.

09:46.716 --> 09:48.805
Both times I failed him.

09:48.849 --> 09:51.460
Dig, you--
- I'm so sorry.

09:51.503 --> 09:52.504
It's okay.

09:54.681 --> 09:56.247
I wasn't there.

09:59.033 --> 10:00.643
He was my brother.

10:02.079 --> 10:03.733
- I know.

10:03.777 --> 10:05.692
Listen to me.

10:05.735 --> 10:08.651
Look, we all--we all died,

10:08.695 --> 10:12.437
the entire universe,
the multiverse.

10:12.481 --> 10:14.657
Now we're back

10:14.701 --> 10:17.573
that means, Oliver,
he might be back too.

10:21.751 --> 10:23.187
- After the brain dump...

10:24.928 --> 10:27.496
We had Felicity run
a global search.

10:27.539 --> 10:29.803
I mean, nobody's better
at finding people,

10:29.846 --> 10:32.240
but they've got to be here
to be found.

10:32.283 --> 10:33.894
- You don't know.

10:33.937 --> 10:37.506
Look, when Oliver died,
he became something else.

10:37.549 --> 10:39.813
He--he called it the Spectre.

10:39.856 --> 10:42.642
Then maybe, Felicity, she just
can't find him in that form.

10:45.514 --> 10:47.168
Dig, she just can't find him
in this form--

10:47.211 --> 10:48.648
- Sara...

10:53.957 --> 10:55.567
Sara, gone is gone.

10:56.786 --> 10:57.744
He's gone.

11:26.773 --> 11:29.210
- J'onn,
what are you doing here?

11:29.253 --> 11:30.428
Is something wrong?

11:30.472 --> 11:34.215
- Not anymore,
no thanks to him.

11:34.258 --> 11:35.782
- Do you know why
he's like this?

11:37.914 --> 11:39.829
- And now so do you.

11:40.874 --> 11:41.918
- Oliver!

11:49.230 --> 11:51.188
- This is all his fault.

11:51.232 --> 11:53.408
He's the one who released
the Anti-Monitor.

11:53.451 --> 11:56.106
- He paid dearly
for his misjudgment,

11:56.150 --> 11:58.892
but not as much as some others.

11:58.935 --> 12:00.807
- Ah!
Ah.

12:02.591 --> 12:04.680
What happened?
Where am I?

12:04.724 --> 12:06.595
How did I get here?

12:06.638 --> 12:09.772
- You nearly damned us
all to hell, Nash Wells!

12:11.731 --> 12:13.384
- Well, that's an introduction.

12:13.428 --> 12:14.995
Who the hell are you
and what are you talking about?

12:15.038 --> 12:15.952
- You need to stay calm.

12:15.996 --> 12:17.562
Your system's still recovering.

12:17.606 --> 12:19.956
You--you need to calm down.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.436
I'm not gonna stay here,

12:21.479 --> 12:22.829
get lectured by
some government suit who--

12:30.837 --> 12:31.838
God.

12:35.058 --> 12:37.974
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

12:38.018 --> 12:41.499
- And so you should be.
This is all your fault!

12:42.849 --> 12:44.981
- It is my fault.

12:45.025 --> 12:47.984
But you--you solved it.

12:48.028 --> 12:49.812
You and the others,
you saved the universe.

12:49.856 --> 12:51.292
You fixed my mistake.

12:52.859 --> 12:53.816
Right?

12:54.861 --> 12:56.732
- Not entirely.

13:01.215 --> 13:02.477
- It's true.

13:02.520 --> 13:04.914
We all live
on the same Earth now.

13:04.958 --> 13:06.176
Our Earths must have merged

13:06.220 --> 13:07.525
when we helped Oliver
reboot the universe.

13:07.569 --> 13:08.875
- I can't believe it.

13:08.918 --> 13:10.267
- What are you guys doing here?

13:10.311 --> 13:11.921
- I had to see if it was true.

13:11.965 --> 13:14.619
The DEO, CatCo,
all of National City

13:14.663 --> 13:16.839
is on this Earth now.
Even Argo's up there.

13:16.883 --> 13:19.886
We did it.
We saved everyone.

13:19.929 --> 13:21.713
- Not everyone.

13:28.503 --> 13:29.504
- Oliver.

13:31.462 --> 13:32.594
He didn't make it.

13:34.988 --> 13:36.859
- Guess we just
have to face facts.

13:36.903 --> 13:40.297
- No, that's not--that's--

13:40.341 --> 13:43.387
- Why did he give everyone else
a fresh start but not himself?

13:44.954 --> 13:47.435
- Maybe this was
the only way, Kara.

13:47.478 --> 13:49.916
Maybe his sacrifice
made all of this possible.

13:53.267 --> 13:55.095
Him for us.

13:59.926 --> 14:01.231
- What is that?
- We're being attacked.

14:01.275 --> 14:02.232
- By who?

14:07.847 --> 14:10.110
- You wouldn't believe it
if I told you.

14:20.163 --> 14:22.557
It's a giant Beebo.

14:22.600 --> 14:25.952
- Beebo hungry.

14:33.524 --> 14:36.005
- How the hell
did Beebo get here?

14:36.049 --> 14:37.572
- Isn't the more
pressing question

14:37.615 --> 14:38.921
why is there a giant Beebo
walking down the street?

14:38.965 --> 14:41.576
- Well, this wouldn't be
the first time.

14:41.619 --> 14:42.577
It's a long story.

14:42.620 --> 14:44.013
- That's right.

14:44.057 --> 14:45.493
Wally told us about
the time you guys used

14:45.536 --> 14:47.147
those totems to turn
yourselves into a giant Beebo

14:47.190 --> 14:48.322
to fight a time demon.

14:48.365 --> 14:49.932
- I guess it's not
a long story.

14:49.976 --> 14:50.933
- Could that be
what's happening here?

14:52.021 --> 14:53.283
- Ava, Nate, you there?

14:53.327 --> 14:54.937
I need a twenty
on Behrad and his totem.

14:54.981 --> 14:57.026
- Sara, are you okay?

14:57.070 --> 14:58.941
Ray called us to tell us you
were on some special mission.

14:58.985 --> 15:00.073
- But he's a little flimsy
with the deets,

15:00.116 --> 15:01.857
so what's the haps, Cap?

15:01.901 --> 15:03.946
- Yeah, we've been busy
saving the multiverse.

15:03.990 --> 15:06.209
- You got shanghaied into
another crossover, didn't you?

15:06.253 --> 15:09.734
- Hmm, yeah, kind of.

15:09.778 --> 15:11.040
- Whoa, whoa.
Did they kidnap you?

15:11.084 --> 15:12.520
- This is
a classic crossover move.

15:12.563 --> 15:14.957
We tell 'em we're too busy,
they commit a felony.

15:15.001 --> 15:18.178
- Guys, Beebo is rampaging
through Star City.

15:18.221 --> 15:19.570
Does Behrad have his totem?

15:19.614 --> 15:21.311
- Beebo?
That doesn't make any sense.

15:21.355 --> 15:23.052
You would need all six totems
to make that happen,

15:23.096 --> 15:24.575
and Behrad's definitely
still on the ship.

15:24.619 --> 15:25.576
- All right, I gotta go.

15:25.620 --> 15:26.882
- Wait, do you need help?

15:26.926 --> 15:28.101
- No, stay in DC.

15:28.144 --> 15:29.450
I don't want any more
of my people

15:29.493 --> 15:30.538
getting roped
into this mess.

15:30.581 --> 15:31.974
- Well, here's the thing.

15:32.018 --> 15:35.456
One of us is
kind of already there.

15:35.499 --> 15:36.979
- Who?

15:37.023 --> 15:39.677
- And who should I
make this out to?

15:39.721 --> 15:40.852
- Doris.

15:40.896 --> 15:43.333
I'm such a huge fan, Rebecca.

15:43.377 --> 15:45.335
I mean, what should I call you?

15:45.379 --> 15:46.989
- Rebecca's fine.

15:47.033 --> 15:49.165
To Doris.

15:49.209 --> 15:52.995
Thanks for the passion, love--

16:07.096 --> 16:08.402
- Fur ball.

16:08.445 --> 16:10.230
- Oh my.

16:14.625 --> 16:17.063
- Oh, man, I can't believe
Nate's gonna miss seeing Beebo.

16:17.106 --> 16:18.847
He's gonna be so jealous.

16:18.890 --> 16:20.066
- Here he comes.

16:20.109 --> 16:21.067
- What's the plan?

16:22.111 --> 16:23.721
Smile, Beebo.

16:23.765 --> 16:24.722
- What?

16:24.766 --> 16:26.159
are you--

16:26.202 --> 16:27.290
- Oh, sorry,
you guys don't wanna be in it?

16:27.334 --> 16:28.857
Oh, bad timing.

16:28.900 --> 16:30.511
- Is this seriously
happening right now?

16:30.554 --> 16:32.252
- Well, maybe
it's a good thing.

16:32.295 --> 16:34.036
- Guess we could all
use the distraction.

16:34.080 --> 16:36.212
- Right, compartmentalize,
focus on the work, good idea.

16:36.256 --> 16:37.909
- Guys, Beebo's still
on the warpath.

16:37.953 --> 16:40.521
Any suggestions on
how we take him down?

16:40.564 --> 16:42.044
- Hey, what is that?

16:42.088 --> 16:44.046
- That's a utility truck.
Why?

16:44.090 --> 16:46.918
- Are you guys ready to do
a tag team trip up?

16:46.962 --> 16:48.442
- Yeah.
What do you have in mind?

16:48.485 --> 16:50.618
- All right, Supergirl,
Atom, keep him contained.

16:50.661 --> 16:52.272
Flash, use those cables
to your left.

16:52.315 --> 16:53.447
- Got it.
- All right.

16:53.490 --> 16:54.709
- Can do.

16:56.580 --> 16:59.235
- Beebo want cuddles!

17:00.976 --> 17:02.238
- Is this actually happening?

17:02.282 --> 17:03.892
- Is this what all
the crossovers are like?

17:03.935 --> 17:05.415
- Yes and not exactly.

17:05.459 --> 17:07.330
- I'm never letting my child
watch that show again.

17:07.374 --> 17:08.853
- Done.

17:08.897 --> 17:09.941
- All right,
now get him moving.

17:09.985 --> 17:12.074
- Die, fur ball!

17:12.118 --> 17:13.510
- Mick?

17:13.554 --> 17:16.905
- That blue bastard
ruined my book signing!

17:16.948 --> 17:19.864
- Okay,
everybody get ready to pull.

17:19.908 --> 17:21.170
- Here, take it.
Take it.

17:21.214 --> 17:22.693
- Ow.

17:22.737 --> 17:25.348
- The bigger they are--
- The harder they--

17:25.392 --> 17:26.784
- Fall!

17:26.828 --> 17:27.916
- Ah!

17:27.959 --> 17:29.091
- Ugh.
- Whoa, whoa.

17:29.135 --> 17:32.138
- Oh, thanks Supergirl.

17:32.181 --> 17:34.096
- What the hell?

17:37.056 --> 17:38.492
- Guys, something's off.

17:38.535 --> 17:40.102
I'm not reading
any known elements,

17:40.146 --> 17:41.321
nothing off the periodic table.

17:45.412 --> 17:46.543
- I don't think
the rules apply

17:46.587 --> 17:48.458
to 50-foot talking plush toy.

17:48.502 --> 17:50.156
- Hey, hey, Kate's here too.

17:50.199 --> 17:52.332
That's--uh, sorry.
What were you saying?

17:54.203 --> 17:56.292
- It's unnatural.

17:56.336 --> 17:57.163
- Alien?

17:57.206 --> 17:58.773
- Hey.
- Or magic?

17:58.816 --> 18:00.166
Sara, don't you
and the Legends deal with

18:00.209 --> 18:01.602
that kind of stuff
all the time?

18:01.645 --> 18:03.473
- Or maybe it's just here
to keep us talking.

18:03.517 --> 18:05.301
- A diversion.

18:05.345 --> 18:06.737
- But for what?

18:06.781 --> 18:08.304
- I know what I'd do.

18:10.219 --> 18:15.355
- It is finally time
for Sargon the Sorcerer

18:15.398 --> 18:18.314
to claim his reward!

18:18.358 --> 18:21.361
Oh, and buy that beautiful
timeshare in Bogota.

18:24.451 --> 18:26.583
- Come on, man, Beebo?

18:26.627 --> 18:27.976
Is nothing sacred?

18:28.019 --> 18:29.325
- You know, it's a smart move.

18:29.369 --> 18:31.022
Distracting all the fuzz

18:31.066 --> 18:34.069
with giant fuzz, but someone
should have told you.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.854
Beebo, he's off limits.

18:42.208 --> 18:44.384
- Beebo!

18:44.427 --> 18:45.385
- Oh!

18:46.429 --> 18:47.604
Got him again.

18:47.648 --> 18:49.650
- Pee-ew.

18:51.217 --> 18:53.219
- So how normal
was that for everyone?

18:53.262 --> 18:54.829
And don't say very.

18:54.872 --> 18:56.744
- Oh, well, with this
new Earth, just may be.

18:56.787 --> 18:59.225
Well, dear God, I hope not.

19:01.792 --> 19:03.359
- What is that?

19:03.403 --> 19:04.360
- Alcohol.

19:07.842 --> 19:08.843
- Mm.

19:10.105 --> 19:11.541
- Rory, huh?

19:11.585 --> 19:14.196
We had a Rory once on our team.

19:14.240 --> 19:15.980
- We did.

19:17.286 --> 19:18.679
- What's this?

19:18.722 --> 19:20.202
- Was there a memo
that went out

19:20.246 --> 19:21.856
on how to infiltrate
our secret bunker?

19:21.899 --> 19:23.205
- Why are you here?

19:23.249 --> 19:25.338
- I'm here to warn you.
You see this?

19:25.381 --> 19:27.557
This gauntlet is primed
to detect antimatter

19:27.601 --> 19:29.907
of which there has been
a massive surge

19:29.951 --> 19:31.996
in the Star City area.

19:32.040 --> 19:33.694
- Okay, well, you're about
two hours too late.

19:33.737 --> 19:35.261
- Yeah,
already took care of it.

19:35.304 --> 19:37.785
- Did you really?
My readings say different.

19:37.828 --> 19:39.308
This thing ain't over.

19:39.352 --> 19:42.311
As a matter of fact,
it's just beginning.

19:48.622 --> 19:50.450
- Something's not right.

19:50.493 --> 19:51.799
- That thing still working?
- Yeah, it's working.

19:51.842 --> 19:53.366
I built it myself.
It's infallible.

19:53.409 --> 19:56.238
- Yeah, but you're still
detecting traces of antimatter.

19:56.282 --> 19:57.587
Then our fight
isn't done, is it?

19:57.631 --> 19:59.241
No.

19:59.285 --> 20:02.462
Or worse, it's starting up
all over again.

20:10.470 --> 20:12.472
- Hey.

20:12.515 --> 20:13.560
- How'd you find me?

20:15.388 --> 20:17.738
- You feel that gust of wind
a few seconds ago?

20:17.781 --> 20:19.435
That was me.

20:19.479 --> 20:21.002
I did a quick search
of the whole city for you.

20:22.656 --> 20:25.049
When you didn't come back
for the post-Beebo celebration,

20:25.093 --> 20:26.312
I got a little worried.

20:27.487 --> 20:28.488
- Yeah.

20:31.317 --> 20:33.057
See that tree over there?

20:33.101 --> 20:35.321
My sister and I,
we used to race to the top

20:35.364 --> 20:36.539
when we were little.

20:36.583 --> 20:38.324
I'd win every time.

20:40.717 --> 20:42.893
I used to think it was
because I was a better climber,

20:42.937 --> 20:47.289
but now I think
Laurel let me win

20:47.333 --> 20:49.291
'cause she knew
I was a sore loser.

20:52.338 --> 20:54.253
A lot has changed since then.

20:55.602 --> 20:58.431
I was an assassin.

20:58.474 --> 21:03.523
I was dead, now I'm the captain
of a friggin' time ship.

21:03.566 --> 21:07.788
One thing remains the same.
I'm still a sore loser.

21:10.834 --> 21:14.185
- I know it's---it's hard

21:14.229 --> 21:17.493
not having Oliver here with us.

21:17.537 --> 21:20.061
But look at what
his sacrifice made possible.

21:21.280 --> 21:24.239
Our world is--it's different...

21:26.241 --> 21:27.808
But at least it's safe.

21:30.941 --> 21:35.424
- He was just the last tether
to my old life, you know?

21:37.208 --> 21:40.516
And he was the only person left
who knew me

21:40.560 --> 21:44.433
when I was just...me.

21:45.521 --> 21:48.611
With him gone,
my connection to this world,

21:48.655 --> 21:52.354
this place, to that tree...

21:54.791 --> 21:56.663
It's gone.

21:58.795 --> 22:01.668
- I know what it's like
to lose family.

22:03.757 --> 22:06.368
My mom, my dad,

22:06.412 --> 22:09.458
each death felt like

22:09.502 --> 22:13.593
there was no moving forward,
like life

22:13.636 --> 22:14.898
would never be the same.

22:17.031 --> 22:18.989
And I was right
it's not the same,

22:19.033 --> 22:23.385
but...somehow it's okay.

22:24.821 --> 22:26.780
Family isn't just the people
that you grew up with.

22:26.823 --> 22:30.087
It's the people you find,
the ones you love,

22:30.131 --> 22:31.698
ones that make you crazy....

22:33.439 --> 22:34.570
Make you smile.

22:36.703 --> 22:38.574
- When did you get so wise?

22:43.100 --> 22:45.973
- The Legends,
they are my family.

22:46.016 --> 22:48.018
They have been for a while.

22:48.062 --> 22:52.240
I guess I just--I always
thought there would be

22:52.283 --> 22:55.417
at least someone who remembered
what I was like

22:55.461 --> 22:57.419
before I got on that boat.

23:14.305 --> 23:15.916
- I thought we got rid
of all those things.

23:15.959 --> 23:19.136
- Barry, Sara,
the shadow demons are back.

23:19.180 --> 23:21.704
I believe we are being hunted.

23:21.748 --> 23:23.750
- If they're hunting
the Paragons, that means--

23:25.186 --> 23:26.448
- Ryan.

23:41.071 --> 23:44.118
- Sara?
What the hell's going on?

23:44.161 --> 23:46.033
- You have to come with me now.

23:47.774 --> 23:50.298
- All right, Barry, J'onn,
Supergirl, and Batlady

23:50.341 --> 23:51.865
are gathering the troops.

23:51.908 --> 23:53.910
Those attacks were probably
just the first wave.

23:53.954 --> 23:56.347
Assassins sent
to pick us off in pairs.

23:56.391 --> 23:58.567
- How are the shadow demons
even still here?

23:58.611 --> 24:00.569
Didn't Oliver destroy the guy
who controls them?

24:00.613 --> 24:02.092
- Well, not according
to the surge

24:02.136 --> 24:04.094
in antimatter energy
I'm reading.

24:04.138 --> 24:06.009
- The Anti-Monitor is alive?

24:07.097 --> 24:09.622
- But you said Oliver
sacrificed himself

24:09.665 --> 24:11.711
to create this new world.

24:11.754 --> 24:14.540
- Apparently, his sacrifice
didn't kill the Anti-Monitor.

24:14.583 --> 24:16.063
- Well, then how do we do that?

24:16.106 --> 24:18.500
- Well, let's just throw him
into the sun

24:18.544 --> 24:20.328
and let the bastard burn.

24:20.371 --> 24:21.851
- Oh yeah, let's throw him
in the sun

24:21.895 --> 24:23.897
and cause
an antimatter explosion

24:23.940 --> 24:25.376
that obliterates
the solar system.

24:25.420 --> 24:26.856
You know what,
let's not do that.

24:26.900 --> 24:28.554
- At least he's trying
to offer up a solution

24:28.597 --> 24:30.599
instead of being
the cause of the problem.

24:30.643 --> 24:32.645
- That's the solution?
Blow up the solar system?

24:32.688 --> 24:36.518
- Guys, guys, we're all
on the same team, okay?

24:36.562 --> 24:38.738
- No, Scrappy's right.

24:38.781 --> 24:40.000
It's my fault
we're in this mess.

24:40.043 --> 24:41.958
We gotta fix it.
Gotta fix it.

24:42.002 --> 24:43.917
- It's just a little tricky.

24:43.960 --> 24:46.310
The Anti-Monitor
is made of antimatter,

24:46.354 --> 24:47.529
and, like its opposite,

24:47.573 --> 24:49.139
it can neither be created
nor destroyed.

24:49.183 --> 24:50.576
It can only--

24:50.619 --> 24:52.229
- Change form
and move from place to place.

24:52.273 --> 24:54.362
So what if we do just that?

24:54.405 --> 24:56.538
What if we could set off
a chain reaction

24:56.582 --> 24:57.931
that will
destabilize his form?

24:57.974 --> 24:59.759
Compressing his molecules
so he's essentially

24:59.802 --> 25:02.196
shrinking for eternity.

25:02.239 --> 25:03.763
- Is that kind of reaction
even possible?

25:03.806 --> 25:05.112
- Sure it is.

25:05.155 --> 25:06.461
I did it a bunch of times by
accident

25:06.505 --> 25:08.245
when I was developing
my ATOM exosuit.

25:08.289 --> 25:10.030
- So you think you can keep him
shrinking indefinitely?

25:10.073 --> 25:12.989
- Essentially, we'd be
sending him to the "atomverse."

25:13.033 --> 25:14.948
- I like to call it
the Microverse.

25:14.991 --> 25:16.471
- Ah, that's better.

25:16.515 --> 25:17.994
Possible trademark issues,
but that's better.

25:18.038 --> 25:20.606
- He could get stuck there
for, like, ever.

25:20.649 --> 25:22.390
- In theory
it could totally work.

25:22.433 --> 25:24.566
But developing
a device in time--

25:24.610 --> 25:26.046
- Leave that to me, D-League.

25:26.089 --> 25:28.483
I just gotta get to STAR Labs.
Scrappy.

25:30.964 --> 25:32.748
- Look, if this goes down
anything like it did

25:32.792 --> 25:36.796
on Earth-38, then things
are gonna get messy.

25:36.839 --> 25:39.146
Geek team, get on it.

25:39.189 --> 25:41.496
Mick, go with 'em,
keep 'em safe.

25:41.540 --> 25:45.456
The rest of us, we'll need to
hold back this incoming army.

25:50.679 --> 25:53.029
- Hey, this can work, Sara.

25:53.073 --> 25:55.031
I know it can.

25:55.075 --> 25:58.165
- That's what we thought
back at the Dawn of Time.

25:58.208 --> 26:00.776
Here we are back at square one.

26:00.820 --> 26:03.300
- This new Earth
isn't square one.

26:03.344 --> 26:06.303
It's what Oliver gave up
his life to create.

26:06.347 --> 26:08.523
We have to protect it.

26:09.829 --> 26:11.004
If we're gonna go down...

26:13.267 --> 26:14.790
We go down fighting.

26:23.712 --> 26:25.061
- All right, listen up.

26:25.105 --> 26:26.672
I got a ton of those
shadow things descending

26:26.715 --> 26:28.848
on Gardner Pier.
- Copy, we're en route.

26:30.850 --> 26:32.112
- This is new.

26:32.155 --> 26:33.809
- New world, new look.

26:33.853 --> 26:35.289
- Cut the chatter,
they're here.

27:03.143 --> 27:05.101
- What the hell?

27:05.145 --> 27:06.668
- Was that it?

27:09.715 --> 27:12.239
- It's not over yet.

27:18.941 --> 27:24.817
- Paragons, the universal
safeguard meant to thwart me.

27:26.209 --> 27:28.168
It is time to meet your end!

27:29.735 --> 27:32.085
- We'll need a reinforced core
to contain the reaction.

27:32.128 --> 27:33.086
- Titanium?

27:33.129 --> 27:34.565
- No, that's too heavy.

27:34.609 --> 27:35.697
- What we need--what
we need is...

27:38.569 --> 27:39.788
Depleted promethium.

27:41.398 --> 27:43.357
- STAR Labs, I've got shadows
advancing on your position.

27:43.400 --> 27:44.750
- On it.

27:44.793 --> 27:46.708
- It's been a while, Frosty.
You look good.

27:46.752 --> 27:49.624
- Thanks.
I read your book, Rebecca.

27:49.668 --> 27:52.018
- Which one?
I'm very prolific.

27:55.195 --> 27:56.979
- Whoa.

27:57.023 --> 27:58.633
- Do you wanna take this guy,
or should I?

27:58.677 --> 27:59.721
- Ladies first.

27:59.765 --> 28:01.157
- Age before beauty.

28:01.201 --> 28:02.724
- Mm.

28:08.034 --> 28:09.426
Who the hell are you?

28:09.470 --> 28:11.080
- Guy who just saved your ass.

28:11.124 --> 28:12.647
- We had that covered.

28:12.691 --> 28:13.648
- Sure you did.

28:14.910 --> 28:16.782
- Company's coming.
You ready?

28:16.825 --> 28:18.871
- I stay ready.

28:20.350 --> 28:23.745
- I am destiny incarnate,

28:23.789 --> 28:27.749
inexorable and inescapable.

28:27.793 --> 28:29.751
You are nothing.

28:29.795 --> 28:33.886
Insects fated to be crushed
beneath my heel

28:33.929 --> 28:36.453
without a moment's thought.

28:36.497 --> 28:37.846
Fighting is useless.

28:39.195 --> 28:40.849
Surrender.

28:43.896 --> 28:46.812
- Not today.
Not ever.

28:47.987 --> 28:51.381
- Oliver died so that we
could continue to fight.

28:51.425 --> 28:54.428
He sacrificed everything
for this new world,

28:54.471 --> 28:56.952
and we will not fail him.

28:56.996 --> 28:59.433
We will not fail this world.

29:00.651 --> 29:02.001
For Oliver.

29:02.044 --> 29:03.916
- For Oliver.
- For Oliver.

29:03.959 --> 29:05.134
- For Oliver!

29:05.178 --> 29:06.353
For Oliver!

30:04.063 --> 30:08.937
- The age of heroes ends now!

30:10.939 --> 30:13.942
- Guys, we're gonna need
a bigger bomb.

30:13.986 --> 30:15.944
- Sky team, with me.

30:32.352 --> 30:35.094
- Ray,
how's that shrink bomb coming?

30:35.137 --> 30:37.009
- Well, we could really use
some fast hands.

30:37.052 --> 30:38.097
- Could we ever.

30:38.140 --> 30:39.141
- Barry.

30:52.981 --> 30:54.896
- Supergirl, look out!

30:56.593 --> 30:57.594
- J'onn!

31:03.122 --> 31:05.080
- Where are you from, Sparkles?

31:05.124 --> 31:07.300
- Don't call me Sparkles.
I'm from Freeland.

31:07.343 --> 31:10.607
Martian came, got in my head,
told me y'all were caught up.

31:10.651 --> 31:13.001
It's been a weird day.

31:16.787 --> 31:17.963
- That's an understatement.

31:20.748 --> 31:22.141
- All right, what
are we making?

31:22.184 --> 31:23.925
- All right, so plans, right?
- Yep.

31:23.969 --> 31:25.318
- Now, this is what
we have to build.

31:25.361 --> 31:27.102
Now, these pieces are all
very volatile.

31:27.146 --> 31:28.930
Be--

31:28.974 --> 31:30.497
- How's this look?
- Okay, that's good.

31:30.540 --> 31:32.107
- Whoa.
- Love when he does that.

31:32.151 --> 31:33.979
- That's perfect, actually.

31:34.022 --> 31:36.068
Okay, so now all we have to do
is get it into direct contact

31:36.111 --> 31:37.939
with the Anti-Monitor
once we've activated it.

31:37.983 --> 31:39.114
- Okay, and to activate it
I just press this button?

31:39.158 --> 31:40.550
- No don't touch that!
- Are you crazy?

31:40.594 --> 31:42.422
- All right, okay,
relax, relax.

31:42.465 --> 31:43.771
All right, Ray,
you're coming with me.

31:43.814 --> 31:44.946
- Oh, cool.

31:56.610 --> 31:57.959
- No!

31:58.003 --> 31:59.178
- Shadows are
on the move again.

31:59.221 --> 32:00.266
Pérez Landing.

32:03.225 --> 32:04.574
- Yeah, we know.
We're here.

32:19.589 --> 32:20.677
Barry.

32:20.721 --> 32:21.896
- Bomb's ready.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.419
Ray's running it
to the sky team.

32:23.463 --> 32:24.986
- We're running
out of time here, Ray.

32:25.030 --> 32:26.814
Hurry!
- Hurrying.

32:55.625 --> 32:57.149
- Hope I'm not too late.

32:58.280 --> 33:01.066
- Ray?
- Hang on, Superman.

33:08.290 --> 33:09.335
Throw it like a girl.

33:11.772 --> 33:13.078
- Always.

33:20.085 --> 33:24.524
- How did you--no!

33:34.099 --> 33:35.970
- We did it.
We did it!

33:36.014 --> 33:37.493
- Wait, but where's Kal?

33:37.537 --> 33:39.060
- I'm right here.

33:39.104 --> 33:40.366
- Whoa.

33:41.497 --> 33:43.978
- Sorry about that, Superman.
Here you go.

33:49.027 --> 33:50.680
- Thank you, Ollie.

33:55.337 --> 33:56.469
- My fellow Americans,

33:56.512 --> 34:01.126
today our way of life,
our world,

34:01.169 --> 34:03.432
almost came to an end.

34:03.476 --> 34:07.262
An entity known as
the Anti-Monitor

34:07.306 --> 34:11.745
attacked Earth
intent on its destruction.

34:11.788 --> 34:14.139
Thankfully, we were saved

34:14.182 --> 34:17.272
by Earth's greatest heroes...

34:17.316 --> 34:20.101
- Hey, Sara.
- Hey, sweetie.

34:20.145 --> 34:21.537
Baby, come over here.

34:21.581 --> 34:23.148
Your brother wants
to play with you.

34:23.191 --> 34:25.106
- Their unity and strength

34:25.150 --> 34:27.587
should be an example
for us all.

34:27.630 --> 34:32.809
I'm told this assembly was led
by Star City's Oliver Queen

34:32.853 --> 34:36.117
otherwise known
as the Green Arrow.

34:36.161 --> 34:40.295
We give thanks
to these brave women and men

34:40.339 --> 34:43.516
who, with great tenacity,
tireless work,

34:43.559 --> 34:47.955
and the utmost courage,
put their lives on the line

34:47.998 --> 34:51.959
for our country, our planet.

34:54.570 --> 34:56.224
- Hey, Lois.

34:56.268 --> 34:57.617
- Clark, I need you to get
to Metropolis now.

34:57.660 --> 34:58.748
It's the boys.

35:00.272 --> 35:01.360
- The boys?

35:01.403 --> 35:03.884
- Yeah, honey, your sons.

35:06.843 --> 35:09.716
- While in
a hard-fought battle,

35:09.759 --> 35:11.587
loss is expected.

35:11.631 --> 35:13.720
It never gets any easier,

35:13.763 --> 35:17.158
so it is with great sadness

35:17.202 --> 35:20.857
that I must inform you
that Oliver Queen

35:20.901 --> 35:25.340
sacrificed his life
for our world's survival.

35:25.384 --> 35:27.168
He is known to us

35:27.212 --> 35:30.215
as the first of our heroes,

35:30.258 --> 35:34.219
and while this is
a devastating loss,

35:34.262 --> 35:36.656
we can take solace in knowing

35:36.699 --> 35:39.311
that he lived as he died,

35:39.354 --> 35:41.661
with honor.

35:41.704 --> 35:45.099
I ask all of you to join me

35:45.143 --> 35:47.754
in a moment of silence
to honor him now.

36:04.727 --> 36:08.644
- A grateful nation thanks you,
Mr. Queen.

36:08.688 --> 36:13.258
May you finally find rest
in the hereafter.

36:13.301 --> 36:15.260
God bless you,

36:15.303 --> 36:19.394
and God bless
the United States of America.

36:19.438 --> 36:20.743
Good night.

36:22.528 --> 36:25.705
- In the end,
there was only one,

36:25.748 --> 36:27.489
a single black infinitude.

36:28.969 --> 36:31.145
Then the infinitude
found release.

36:35.932 --> 36:39.501
And finally,
the darkness broke,

36:39.545 --> 36:40.937
filling it with life....

36:43.505 --> 36:45.333
With the multiverse.

36:49.772 --> 36:52.993
Every existence
multiplied by possibility.

36:57.432 --> 37:02.437
And spread out before space
and time in infinite measure.

37:08.182 --> 37:12.317
Civilizations
rose and fell....

37:14.362 --> 37:17.583
And rose again across
reality's grasping expanse.

37:21.674 --> 37:25.460
Life, a precious gift,
persevering

37:25.504 --> 37:27.332
in the face
of every obstacle...

37:34.382 --> 37:37.559
Until, finally,

37:37.603 --> 37:39.561
the age of heroes was born

37:50.355 --> 37:53.314
- Thanks for saving us,
Oliver.

37:53.358 --> 37:55.055
The world has hope again.

37:56.796 --> 37:59.015
I have hope again.

37:59.059 --> 38:00.321
We'll never forget you.

38:09.722 --> 38:12.377
- Thanks for believing in me
even when I didn't.

38:14.640 --> 38:19.035
You had this way of bringing
out the very best in all of us.

38:21.560 --> 38:23.475
I'm gonna miss you, man.

38:34.573 --> 38:36.270
- I've lost a lot of people
that I love.

38:37.967 --> 38:41.493
But I never imagined my life
without you in it.

38:41.536 --> 38:43.712
You were always there for me.

38:43.756 --> 38:45.235
And now...

38:49.414 --> 38:53.026
Ollie, you changed my fate
for the better.

38:55.594 --> 38:56.856
Thank you.

39:25.624 --> 39:30.106
- I never met Oliver, but he
must have been a good dude.

39:40.073 --> 39:42.467
But why'd you choose
a condemned building?

39:42.510 --> 39:43.816
- What?

39:43.859 --> 39:46.035
No, this is not
a condemned building.

39:46.079 --> 39:49.648
No, listen, this is an old
STAR Labs Research Facility

39:49.691 --> 39:51.606
that nobody uses,
and what's even better,

39:51.650 --> 39:53.652
no one knows it exists.

39:53.695 --> 39:54.827
- Good for you.
- No, good for us.

39:54.870 --> 39:56.916
I figure we could all
use this to gather

39:56.959 --> 40:00.006
if anything ever happens again.

40:00.049 --> 40:01.311
- It's a great idea, Barry.

40:01.355 --> 40:03.009
- Thanks, Superman.

40:03.052 --> 40:05.054
- It's a better option than
you all dropping by the DEO.

40:05.098 --> 40:06.578
- Why do we even need it?

40:06.621 --> 40:08.057
I mean, how often does
the world

40:08.101 --> 40:09.668
almost come to an end?

40:13.715 --> 40:15.456
Oh, it's like that.

40:15.500 --> 40:17.850
- Don't worry,
I was the new kid last year.

40:17.893 --> 40:19.460
- All right, listen,
I haven't even shown you guys

40:19.504 --> 40:21.201
the best part yet.
You ready?

40:27.555 --> 40:29.514
- Oh, nice.

40:42.701 --> 40:44.267
You should have
led with that, bro.

40:44.311 --> 40:45.486
- Yeah.

40:45.530 --> 40:47.183
- Not bad.
- I love it.

40:51.710 --> 40:53.146
- It's perfect.

41:30.052 --> 41:32.533
Sounds like we need
to call pest control.

41:32.577 --> 41:34.056
- What was that?

42:12.660 --> 42:14.314
- Greg, move your head.
