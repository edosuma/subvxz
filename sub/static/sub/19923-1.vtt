WEBVTT

02:10.931 --> 02:13.340
But we did it yesterday.

02:30.417 --> 02:32.512
He said he loved it.

02:36.257 --> 02:40.168
I'm so glad he clapped,
because if not it, would be...

03:01.315 --> 03:03.750
Father, I want to get married.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.981
You want me to find you a beautiful wife?

03:11.725 --> 03:13.751
I want to marry Nino Kipiani.

03:15.596 --> 03:18.439
Her hips are too slim, like all Georgians.

03:18.499 --> 03:19.762
Father!

03:20.968 --> 03:23.811
A woman's hips are more important
than her education, my son.

03:23.871 --> 03:24.964
Remember that.

03:33.747 --> 03:36.357
When do you want to marry?

03:36.417 --> 03:37.441
Soon.

03:42.489 --> 03:45.049
I should like my grandson to be born in May.

03:46.527 --> 03:47.961
It is a lucky month.

03:50.698 --> 03:52.339
Why did you choose her?

03:52.399 --> 03:53.774
I love her, Father.

03:53.834 --> 03:57.544
Generally speaking,
loving a woman is not a good idea.

03:57.604 --> 03:59.380
Father.

04:08.682 --> 04:12.760
Ali Khan, congratulations on graduating.

04:12.820 --> 04:16.397
It's a very well-deserved
celebration for you.

04:16.457 --> 04:18.399
Will you be going on to study in Moscow?

04:18.459 --> 04:19.927
I haven't decided.

04:23.997 --> 04:25.556
May I ask you for this dance?

04:27.468 --> 04:28.527
Father?

04:29.636 --> 04:31.104
Certainly.

04:46.487 --> 04:48.896
How much for the land, sir?
How big is your domain?

04:49.956 --> 04:52.825
Well, sometimes I'm quite shy, but...

04:55.261 --> 04:57.162
No, no.

05:00.768 --> 05:02.430
May I?

05:04.938 --> 05:07.134
- Yes, of course.
- Thank you.

05:12.679 --> 05:15.956
- I'm Malik Nakhararyan.
- Oh. Nino Kipiani.

05:16.016 --> 05:19.026
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Lovely to meet you.

05:19.086 --> 05:20.761
I'm a very good friend of your father.

05:20.821 --> 05:23.196
- Oh.
- We are in business together.

05:38.939 --> 05:40.430
Thank you.

05:49.183 --> 05:51.091
But we have to do that.

05:51.151 --> 05:53.827
After all, it's the supply,
we have to control.

05:53.887 --> 05:56.430
Well, at least we try to.

05:56.490 --> 05:59.867
Prince Ali Khan, you are most welcome.

05:59.927 --> 06:02.803
I am so sorry, but my train was late.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.195
Not at all. Come and join us.

06:06.633 --> 06:07.999
- Welcome here.
- Thank you.

06:16.076 --> 06:18.886
I have just learned of your
ennoblement, Your Highness.

06:18.946 --> 06:20.187
My sincere congratulations.

06:20.247 --> 06:21.977
You are most kind. Thank you.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.125
Thank you.

06:25.185 --> 06:26.593
God is in our wine.

06:26.653 --> 06:28.178
It can do you no harm.

06:29.122 --> 06:32.251
Father, Ali Khan does not take alcohol.

06:32.493 --> 06:34.655
It's against his religion.

06:36.897 --> 06:41.475
On this occasion, I will make
an exception so I can toast Prince Kipiani.

06:41.535 --> 06:43.510
Thank you, young man.

06:43.570 --> 06:44.878
Prince Kipiani.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.531
Prince Kipiani.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.822
You must go and look at our gardens
after dinner, Ali Khan.

06:54.882 --> 06:57.758
We have the most beautiful ancient trees.

06:57.818 --> 07:02.062
Thank you, Your Highness,
but I came to visit you, not your trees.

07:02.122 --> 07:05.132
What, you have something against trees?

07:05.192 --> 07:07.868
Ali Khan is afraid of trees, Mr. Nakhararyan.

07:07.928 --> 07:11.538
Not exactly, but what others feel
for trees, I feel for the desert.

07:11.598 --> 07:12.973
The desert?

07:13.033 --> 07:15.175
It's just scrub and sand.

07:15.235 --> 07:17.144
That's what I love about it:

07:17.204 --> 07:19.112
Its simplicity.

07:19.172 --> 07:21.648
Maybe that's the difference
between East and West.

07:21.708 --> 07:25.652
The desert asks for nothing,
promises nothing,

07:25.712 --> 07:27.788
but the woods are full of questions.

07:27.848 --> 07:29.189
- Well...
- Ali Khan.

07:29.249 --> 07:31.959
Eagles come from the mountains

07:32.019 --> 07:34.595
and tigers from the forest,

07:34.655 --> 07:38.532
but nothing... nothing comes from the desert.

07:38.592 --> 07:41.601
Lions and warriors come from the desert.

07:44.598 --> 07:46.874
Lions and warriors.

07:46.934 --> 07:50.977
And not to forget,
the source of our wealth, our oil.

07:54.274 --> 07:56.216
Ali Khan.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.218
I'm so happy you came.

08:31.278 --> 08:33.153
I'm sorry I was late.

08:33.212 --> 08:35.078
I was getting worried.

08:38.085 --> 08:39.826
Who was that man sitting next to you?

08:39.885 --> 08:41.929
Malik?

08:41.989 --> 08:44.698
He's from a very important Armenian family.

08:47.227 --> 08:49.303
Your father's a prince now.

08:49.363 --> 08:51.972
Does that make you a princess?

08:52.032 --> 08:53.625
It does.

09:07.114 --> 09:09.379
I think I love you, Ali Khan.

09:10.384 --> 09:12.376
Even though I'm a princess.

09:14.221 --> 09:17.030
Maybe you won't be one for very long.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.683
What do you mean?

09:20.160 --> 09:23.187
Don't you lose the title
when you get married?

09:28.969 --> 09:31.063
Is that supposed to be a proposal?

09:33.073 --> 09:34.701
Yes.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.319
Will you always love me, Ali Khan?

09:39.379 --> 09:40.821
Yes.

09:40.881 --> 09:45.383
And will you stay with me, whatever
happens, and take no other wives?

09:47.821 --> 09:50.297
Yes.

09:50.357 --> 09:53.384
Won't your father demand I become a Muslim?

09:55.195 --> 09:56.219
No.

09:59.132 --> 10:01.775
I've always wanted to go to Paris,

10:01.835 --> 10:05.078
more than anywhere in the world.

10:05.138 --> 10:09.015
I promise I will take you
to Paris for our honeymoon.

10:13.246 --> 10:16.156
Now...

10:16.216 --> 10:17.912
will you marry me?

10:19.419 --> 10:20.978
I will.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.131
I will, Ali.

10:52.018 --> 10:53.008
Khan.

10:54.387 --> 10:56.329
Khan.

10:56.389 --> 10:58.017
A telegram for you.

11:06.266 --> 11:09.042
<i>My dear son, the czar has seen fit</i>

11:09.102 --> 11:12.279
<i>to declare war on various European monarchs.</i>

11:12.339 --> 11:15.798
<i>Return at once to Baku
and be ready to do your duty.</i>

11:19.146 --> 11:22.923
Who's this war against?

11:22.983 --> 11:25.892
The German kaiser, the Austrian emperor,

11:25.952 --> 11:30.063
the king of Bavaria, the king
of Prussia, the king of Hungary,

11:30.123 --> 11:31.498
the sultan of the Ottoman Empire...

11:31.558 --> 11:33.366
And who are Russia's allies?

11:33.426 --> 11:38.004
The king of England, the king of Serbia,
the king of the Belgians,

11:38.064 --> 11:42.976
<i>the president of the French Republic,
and the emperor of Japan.</i>

12:46.533 --> 12:48.875
<i>I know, when our family ruled this country,</i>

12:48.935 --> 12:51.962
<i>how many of them fought
and died on the battlefield.</i>

12:53.340 --> 12:57.250
<i>Your father, your grandfather.</i>

12:57.310 --> 13:00.053
<i>And I feel part of that.</i>

13:00.113 --> 13:04.090
But why should I fight for one
Christian monarch against another?

13:04.150 --> 13:07.861
Why should I fight for Russia's
cause, whatever it may be?

13:07.921 --> 13:10.330
We've grown used to thinking
of ourselves as part of Russia.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.365
We are not.

13:12.425 --> 13:16.102
They invaded us a hundred years ago
and took away our family's power.

13:16.162 --> 13:18.631
We are an occupied country.

13:21.167 --> 13:25.138
Believe me, Father, I shall be proud
to die in battle when the time comes.

13:28.275 --> 13:30.574
But this is not our fight.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.587
You're crazy.

13:33.647 --> 13:36.957
You mean you're going to pass up
this wonderful opportunity?

13:37.017 --> 13:40.927
Ilyas, we're here,

13:40.987 --> 13:43.330
and the front line will be around here...

13:43.390 --> 13:46.299
2,000 miles away in Belgium.

13:46.359 --> 13:50.303
If we get to fight at all, it will
most probably be against the Turks,

13:50.363 --> 13:52.539
our cousins... why should I want to do that?

13:52.599 --> 13:54.241
For the glory.

13:54.301 --> 13:56.476
Listen, do you care who wins this war?

13:56.536 --> 13:58.495
No, not in the least.

13:59.338 --> 14:02.482
- You just want to fight.
- Yes, I want to be a soldier.

14:02.542 --> 14:06.386
I've always wanted to be.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

14:06.446 --> 14:10.322
You'll be jealous when you see me
in my officer's uniform, Ali.

14:11.151 --> 14:13.927
I'm sure you'll both
be brave officers, but why?

14:13.987 --> 14:15.595
It will be an adventure.

14:15.655 --> 14:17.146
That's the important thing.

14:18.692 --> 14:20.354
What do you think, Seyid?

14:23.663 --> 14:25.495
I'm with you.

14:26.967 --> 14:29.436
I don't think this war
is any of our business.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.850
At least I won't have to go back to school.

14:42.115 --> 14:43.344
Beautiful.

14:44.651 --> 14:47.460
When will you go and see him?

14:47.520 --> 14:49.462
My father?

14:49.522 --> 14:50.581
Soon.

15:06.006 --> 15:08.081
Your Excellency can assure the czar

15:08.141 --> 15:11.776
there will be no interruption in
the oil supply in the coming months.

15:12.012 --> 15:13.708
There is even scope for an increase.

15:17.150 --> 15:19.459
Prince Ali Khan.

15:19.519 --> 15:22.228
I'm afraid it has to be admitted
that, regrettably,

15:22.288 --> 15:24.655
war is extremely good for business.

15:31.698 --> 15:36.042
As you may know, our family were rulers
in this region for nearly 700 years.

15:36.102 --> 15:37.610
Yes.

15:37.670 --> 15:42.148
We have retained enough property in
the city to make us financially secure.

15:42.208 --> 15:43.699
I don't doubt it.

15:44.711 --> 15:45.804
So...

15:46.046 --> 15:47.036
Yes?

15:48.181 --> 15:53.246
I have the honor to ask Your Highness'
permission to marry Princess Nino.

16:06.399 --> 16:09.309
This is genuinely an honor, Ali Khan,

16:09.369 --> 16:12.737
not only for Nino but for our entire family.

16:14.907 --> 16:16.450
However...

16:17.310 --> 16:20.353
I can't help feeling she's still
rather young to marry,

16:20.413 --> 16:23.156
to say nothing of the differences
in background

16:23.216 --> 16:25.458
and in, uh, religion.

16:25.518 --> 16:26.957
I'm...

16:28.188 --> 16:30.555
Sure this is also of concern to your father.

16:31.825 --> 16:33.433
No.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.635
I've discussed it with him.

16:35.695 --> 16:38.772
Well, anyway, main thing is,
the world has embarked

16:38.832 --> 16:42.375
on a terrible and unpredictable war.

16:42.435 --> 16:45.166
I think we should wait to see its outcome.

16:46.272 --> 16:47.638
Don't you agree?

17:06.593 --> 17:07.583
Ali Khan.

17:10.896 --> 17:12.505
Are you all right?

17:12.565 --> 17:14.227
What's the matter?

17:15.702 --> 17:17.510
How dare he?

17:17.569 --> 17:21.636
A hundred years ago, a Kipiani would have
kissed my feet for such an opportunity.

17:23.809 --> 17:25.635
My father will laugh at me.

17:26.713 --> 17:29.422
- He didn't actually say no.
- The end of the war.

17:29.482 --> 17:32.792
This war could go on for 20 years.

17:32.852 --> 17:35.412
- What will you do?
- We'll run away together.

17:37.257 --> 17:39.692
You mean kidnap her?

17:43.663 --> 17:47.774
Well, I'm not against the idea.

17:47.834 --> 17:51.177
It's the traditional way
to settle problems of this kind,

17:51.237 --> 17:53.502
but it should be
the last resort, shouldn't it?

17:55.508 --> 17:57.851
I think...

17:57.911 --> 18:00.253
someone should explain to Prince Kipiani

18:00.313 --> 18:03.189
what a wonderful marriage this would be

18:03.249 --> 18:05.718
for all kinds of political
and cultural reasons.

18:07.654 --> 18:09.623
Who is going to do that?

18:12.192 --> 18:14.787
I can. Leave it to me.

18:19.566 --> 18:20.874
Thank you.

18:20.934 --> 18:24.244
Why did you say the end of the war?

18:24.304 --> 18:28.848
I don't think there is
any need to rush into it.

18:28.908 --> 18:31.451
Everyone says it will be over by Christmas.

18:31.511 --> 18:32.752
But how do you know?

18:32.812 --> 18:35.188
Nobody knows how long it's going to last.

18:35.248 --> 18:37.974
I thought it would be good for you
to have some thinking time.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.893
Why do I need thinking time?

18:39.953 --> 18:42.395
You'd rather just join
his harem without thinking?

18:42.455 --> 18:45.331
But he said he's not gonna
take any other wives.

18:45.391 --> 18:47.267
Nino, don't be so naive.

18:47.327 --> 18:50.436
Once they get what they want,

18:50.496 --> 18:53.728
men don't always remember their promises.

19:07.347 --> 19:10.390
A Georgian, an Azerbaijani,
and an Armenian...

19:10.450 --> 19:12.559
three great Caucasian people.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.835
Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.

19:22.895 --> 19:24.904
My wife will tell it to you every minute.

19:24.964 --> 19:28.640
- Gregor, you're bad.
- Tell him. Recite one now.

19:30.937 --> 19:33.846
Recite one of your poems now.

19:33.906 --> 19:35.982
We have the same face.

19:36.042 --> 19:37.917
Really? Oh, I don't think so.

19:48.021 --> 19:49.996
What's happening in the war?

19:50.056 --> 19:51.898
The Germans have occupied Poland.

19:51.958 --> 19:55.368
Russians are advancing on Baghdad.

19:55.428 --> 19:56.803
It's all the same to us.

19:56.863 --> 20:00.406
Well, better than school, anyway.

20:00.466 --> 20:02.275
We have horses. We have guns.

20:02.335 --> 20:04.176
Can't you volunteer for the front?

20:04.236 --> 20:06.512
They won't take Muslim officers at the front

20:06.572 --> 20:09.115
in case we refuse to fire on other Muslims.

20:11.444 --> 20:12.885
And they're right.

20:12.945 --> 20:15.005
I don't want to kill my Turkish brothers.

20:15.848 --> 20:17.724
Courtesy of the officers.

20:17.784 --> 20:19.792
Pork chops for the boys.

20:26.359 --> 20:28.624
You see the kind of thing
we have to deal with?

20:31.397 --> 20:33.628
You were so right not to join up.

20:55.855 --> 20:57.517
Hello!

20:58.591 --> 21:00.433
- I'm gonna go.
- Okay.

21:00.493 --> 21:01.517
Bye.

21:12.505 --> 21:13.996
Salaam alaikum.

21:21.848 --> 21:24.757
Is Malik making any progress?

21:24.817 --> 21:27.360
He's certainly trying hard enough.

21:27.420 --> 21:29.929
But my mother still calls you a wild Muslim.

21:31.391 --> 21:34.834
I don't think anyone's ever
called me wild before.

21:34.894 --> 21:36.969
I quite like that.

21:37.029 --> 21:40.173
I don't think she meant it as a compliment.

22:03.156 --> 22:06.766
I know your friends
are serving in the army, Ali.

22:06.826 --> 22:09.669
But between you and me,

22:09.729 --> 22:12.631
I'm sorry the Russians are doing so well.

22:15.134 --> 22:18.578
- Does it matter to us?
- It does.

22:18.638 --> 22:20.546
Because unless the Russians are defeated,

22:20.606 --> 22:23.750
we have no chance to achieve
what our country most needs.

22:23.810 --> 22:25.438
And what is that?

22:27.180 --> 22:29.115
Our independence.

22:33.186 --> 22:36.020
My father thinks we have
no chance of independence.

22:37.657 --> 22:39.888
I think he is wrong.

22:42.895 --> 22:46.072
<i>Left, left, one, two, three!</i>

22:52.038 --> 22:53.446
<i>Ali, it's me.</i>

22:53.506 --> 22:54.547
Any news?

22:54.607 --> 22:55.915
<i>Malik's here.</i>

22:55.975 --> 22:58.451
He's telling them that in this region,

22:58.511 --> 23:02.121
he thinks mixed marriages
are the only way forward.

23:02.181 --> 23:03.890
- Is that so?
- Yes.

23:03.950 --> 23:06.626
And I think, after the war,

23:06.686 --> 23:08.528
maybe, even more...

23:08.588 --> 23:10.989
All right. Maybe we can see each other later.

23:15.628 --> 23:17.170
More...

23:17.230 --> 23:18.905
complicated, yeah.

23:21.667 --> 23:23.476
So I'll see you after the opera.

23:23.536 --> 23:25.077
I think it's time for us to go.

23:25.737 --> 23:28.707
- See you later.
- Nino? Are you coming?

23:29.876 --> 23:31.037
Bye.

24:17.590 --> 24:21.868
If Russia takes Turkey and Persia,
the czar has said he will close

24:21.928 --> 24:24.937
our mosques and schools
and abolish our languages.

24:24.997 --> 24:28.274
And yet the czar asks us for money.

24:28.334 --> 24:31.644
Why should we collaborate
in the destruction of our own culture?

24:31.704 --> 24:35.948
All we can be sure of is that after the war,
everything will be quite different.

24:36.008 --> 24:39.685
All the great powers
will be weak and exhausted,

24:39.745 --> 24:42.188
but we will still have our strength,

24:42.248 --> 24:44.824
our money, and our oil.

24:44.884 --> 24:46.959
Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could become

24:47.019 --> 24:49.887
the first democratic Muslim nation?

24:53.326 --> 24:56.626
I don't like the way
he's trying to portray the czar.

24:59.165 --> 25:00.895
I agree with Fatali Khan.

25:02.635 --> 25:04.010
We should liberate ourselves.

25:04.070 --> 25:08.114
And I don't mean go back a hundred years ago
to the way it was before the Russians came.

25:08.174 --> 25:13.108
I mean we should create a modern
progressive country and run it ourselves.

25:19.685 --> 25:22.895
Thank you so much for agreeing
to accompany me, Mr. Nakhararyan.

25:22.955 --> 25:24.924
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.

25:26.626 --> 25:28.400
It's my pleasure.

25:46.679 --> 25:48.020
As-salaam alaikum.

25:48.080 --> 25:51.057
Amir, you have to talk to the young people.

25:51.117 --> 25:52.892
They listen to you.

26:20.880 --> 26:22.405
It was a wonderful evening.

26:27.953 --> 26:29.854
Thank you.

26:36.162 --> 26:38.131
Wait. Wait.

26:41.834 --> 26:43.097
I like you.

26:45.004 --> 26:46.472
I really like you.

26:48.808 --> 26:50.106
Wha... what are you doing?

26:53.045 --> 26:54.954
We can leave the country together.

26:55.014 --> 26:57.056
- We will get married in Moscow.
- No.

26:57.116 --> 26:58.991
Yeah. And then we'll go to London.

26:59.051 --> 27:01.427
No, no, no. Malik. What are you doing?

27:01.487 --> 27:04.730
Let me out. Stop the car! Malik!

27:04.790 --> 27:05.831
Let me out!

27:10.062 --> 27:12.138
Let me go! Let me go!

27:13.499 --> 27:15.941
Stop the car, Malik!

27:16.001 --> 27:18.110
Good to have your support.

27:18.170 --> 27:19.445
Thank you for inviting me, sir.

27:19.505 --> 27:20.973
Thank you, Fatali Khan.

27:25.845 --> 27:27.519
You conducted yourself very well, my son.

27:27.579 --> 27:28.769
Ali!

27:29.982 --> 27:31.390
Ali.

27:33.052 --> 27:34.393
Nakhararyan has kidnapped Nino.

27:34.453 --> 27:36.028
No, they were just going to the opera.

27:36.088 --> 27:39.165
No. He was trying to kiss her.

27:39.225 --> 27:41.285
Then he drove off with her.

27:53.205 --> 27:54.943
- What do you think you're doing?
- Let me go!

27:55.023 --> 27:56.682
You're gonna stay with me. Do you understand?

27:56.742 --> 28:00.076
- Let me go! You can't do this!
- No! You can't go. You're mine now.

28:01.380 --> 28:03.542
I'm not gonna say it again.

28:09.155 --> 28:10.555
They were heading for the coast road.

28:33.245 --> 28:35.043
Maybe it's for the best.

29:37.476 --> 29:39.183
What are you doing?

29:45.917 --> 29:47.959
No, Ali.

31:31.256 --> 31:32.846
Ali.

32:43.195 --> 32:44.629
What happened?

32:46.398 --> 32:47.798
I thought...

32:49.501 --> 32:51.697
You thought what?

32:53.338 --> 32:54.613
I mean,

32:54.673 --> 32:56.801
did he...

32:58.577 --> 33:01.342
Did he what?

33:04.349 --> 33:06.648
No, he didn't.

33:12.191 --> 33:13.998
He's dead.

33:39.852 --> 33:41.794
I have 40 men guarding the house.

33:41.854 --> 33:44.830
- You have to leave tonight.
- Why?

33:44.890 --> 33:48.300
The Nakhararyans, they have
put a price on your head.

33:48.360 --> 33:50.488
They are going to come looking for you.

33:55.200 --> 33:58.410
I am going to send you
to our people in the mountains.

33:58.470 --> 34:01.167
How long do I have to stay away?

34:02.207 --> 34:03.835
A very long time.

34:08.280 --> 34:10.579
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

34:13.351 --> 34:14.342
Would you like to sit?

34:17.222 --> 34:19.384
In the circumstances, Khan...

34:21.460 --> 34:25.204
I'm convinced...

34:25.264 --> 34:27.927
the only honorable solution
is for them to marry.

34:30.435 --> 34:32.344
- It cannot be done, Prince.
- Yes.

34:32.404 --> 34:34.565
It could be done tonight.

34:36.275 --> 34:37.264
Where is he?

34:39.878 --> 34:42.245
I believe he's gone to his uncle's in Persia.

34:44.949 --> 34:46.384
They have to marry.

34:48.719 --> 34:52.484
I'm sure you'll be able
to find her some suitable husband.

34:54.560 --> 34:57.587
We both know that no one will marry her now.

35:03.268 --> 35:04.497
Thank you for coming.

36:07.566 --> 36:09.908
- What's this?
- Hashish.

36:09.968 --> 36:11.977
It's good for the pain.

36:12.037 --> 36:13.630
And for the conscience.

36:17.309 --> 36:18.402
Ali.

37:46.765 --> 37:49.007
Kasi Mullah?

37:49.067 --> 37:50.676
This is Ali Khan Shirvanshir.

37:50.736 --> 37:52.830
He needs your protection.

38:01.413 --> 38:03.439
Follow me, Your Honor.

38:17.963 --> 38:20.159
Ali Khan. Ali Khan.

38:28.473 --> 38:30.738
I'm afraid he's very ill.

38:32.844 --> 38:35.712
No one is ill for long in Dagestan.

38:43.054 --> 38:44.647
I'm sorry.

38:46.792 --> 38:49.901
Really, I don't understand
what you're saying.

38:49.961 --> 38:52.437
Prince Kipiani,

38:52.497 --> 38:55.574
out of respect for the Nakhararyan family,

38:55.634 --> 38:58.410
our community feels obliged
to ask that your daughter

38:58.470 --> 39:02.566
refrain from attending Mass
for the foreseeable future.

39:23.962 --> 39:26.004
I don't know what else I can do.

39:26.064 --> 39:28.056
Well, you'd better think of something.

39:30.001 --> 39:31.196
Look at her.

39:33.138 --> 39:34.834
Look at you.

39:36.074 --> 39:37.940
We can't go on like this.

40:00.098 --> 40:01.940
I don't want to go to Moscow.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.475
I'm afraid, on this occasion,
we are not asking your opinion.

40:04.535 --> 40:07.546
- I refuse...
- The arrangements have already been made.

40:07.606 --> 40:09.548
- Father, please.
- No!

40:09.608 --> 40:11.983
It's quite obvious
there's no future for you here.

40:12.043 --> 40:13.518
There is no future for me in Moscow.

40:13.578 --> 40:17.276
There is a chance not everyone there
will have heard what happened.

42:00.185 --> 42:02.916
My parents are sending me to Moscow tomorrow.

42:04.189 --> 42:07.132
Then it's your duty to obey them.

42:07.192 --> 42:08.285
Is it not?

42:09.961 --> 42:12.692
If you won't take me, I'll go on my own.

43:35.013 --> 43:36.721
Nino?

43:36.781 --> 43:38.890
Yeah.

43:38.950 --> 43:39.940
Nino.

43:47.025 --> 43:49.434
How did you get here?

43:49.494 --> 43:52.157
Seyid Mustafa brought me.

44:12.517 --> 44:14.486
I've missed you so much.

45:38.136 --> 45:39.126
Seyid.

45:40.271 --> 45:43.014
Go fetch the mullah and tell him
I need to get married immediately.

45:43.074 --> 45:44.916
We don't need a mullah.

45:44.976 --> 45:46.384
I know how to conduct a marriage.

45:46.444 --> 45:49.120
I just need to prepare the papers.

45:49.180 --> 45:51.274
Good. In an hour's time, then.

46:01.593 --> 46:03.619
You really want to do this?

46:04.896 --> 46:05.955
Do you?

46:09.033 --> 46:12.128
Are you prepared to marry a fallen woman?

46:13.071 --> 46:15.980
Are you prepared to stay here?

46:16.040 --> 46:19.568
This hut? Won't you be bored?

46:21.045 --> 46:22.013
No.

46:30.922 --> 46:31.963
What is your name?

46:32.023 --> 46:36.100
Ali Khan Shirvanshir. Son of Safar Khan.

46:36.160 --> 46:37.235
Your religion?

46:37.295 --> 46:39.204
Shia Muslim.

46:39.264 --> 46:40.630
What's your wish?

46:43.468 --> 46:45.528
To take this woman as my wife.

46:48.006 --> 46:49.531
What is your name?

46:51.609 --> 46:53.271
Princess Nino Kipiani.

46:55.079 --> 46:56.554
Your religion?

46:56.614 --> 46:58.356
Georgian Orthodox.

46:58.416 --> 46:59.679
What is your wish?

47:02.520 --> 47:04.495
To be this man's wife.

47:04.555 --> 47:07.131
Do you wish to retain your religion?

47:07.191 --> 47:09.217
Yes, I do.

47:12.463 --> 47:16.230
Please, sign here.

47:19.437 --> 47:21.235
What... what name should I sign?

47:22.473 --> 47:24.442
Your new name.

48:35.012 --> 48:39.190
<i>My dear parents, please don't worry about me.</i>

48:39.250 --> 48:43.516
<i>Ali and I are married, and everything
has turned out for the best.</i>

48:48.259 --> 48:51.336
<i>Life is simple in the mountains.</i>

48:51.396 --> 48:54.798
<i>We raise chickens,
and we grow our own vegetables.</i>

48:57.702 --> 49:01.700
<i>We work all day and play
a full part in the life of the village.</i>

49:05.777 --> 49:08.269
<i>We have none of the comforts of the city.</i>

49:11.049 --> 49:13.391
<i>But I can honestly say</i>

49:13.451 --> 49:17.028
<i>I have never been so happy in my life.</i>

49:17.088 --> 49:20.183
<i>With all my love, Nino.</i>

49:40.144 --> 49:42.487
I need something warm.

49:42.547 --> 49:46.090
Something warm. Something warm.

50:05.536 --> 50:09.347
My father suggests we make our way to Sweden.

50:09.407 --> 50:10.739
Neutral country.

50:12.410 --> 50:15.670
Does he suggest how we might
get there in the middle of a war?

50:17.148 --> 50:18.514
They pay no attention.

50:19.750 --> 50:23.094
When you write back,

50:23.154 --> 50:26.181
tell them we are living the way
most people live in our country.

50:27.191 --> 50:28.557
And it makes sense.

52:09.994 --> 52:12.293
It belonged to Ali's mother.

52:14.665 --> 52:16.998
Thank you so much, Safar Khan.

52:18.502 --> 52:19.595
Thank you.

52:26.744 --> 52:30.054
Do you fetch the water from the well
every morning, my child?

52:32.850 --> 52:34.592
And do you do all the cooking?

52:34.652 --> 52:35.984
Yes, I do.

52:39.323 --> 52:40.552
Thank you.

52:48.266 --> 52:50.030
<i>I approve of your wife, Ali Khan.</i>

52:51.602 --> 52:53.844
But...

52:53.904 --> 52:56.714
she is a very bad cook.

52:56.774 --> 53:00.484
Safar Khan, can I tempt you to some more?

53:00.544 --> 53:01.953
No, thank you. Delicious.

53:02.013 --> 53:03.504
I couldn't.

53:04.548 --> 53:05.890
How's life in Baku?

53:05.950 --> 53:08.726
All is much the same, except...

53:08.786 --> 53:10.761
the streets are rather chaotic

53:10.821 --> 53:14.588
because our Russian governor has run away.

53:15.459 --> 53:16.934
Why would that be?

53:16.994 --> 53:19.293
The czar abdicated.

53:20.464 --> 53:22.006
What?

53:22.066 --> 53:23.774
Yes.

53:23.834 --> 53:25.943
So the Russians have all left the city.

53:26.003 --> 53:29.569
And our soldiers are back from the front,
released from their oath to the czar.

53:34.445 --> 53:36.420
But what about the Nakhararyans?

53:36.480 --> 53:39.957
The entire Nakhararyan family
has fled to Moscow.

53:40.017 --> 53:41.959
And my family?

53:42.019 --> 53:45.649
I believe they have
very sensibly gone to Tbilisi.

53:51.595 --> 53:53.564
Does that mean we can go back?

53:54.498 --> 53:55.659
I see no objection.

54:08.379 --> 54:11.679
<i>We've been happy here. Do we have to leave?</i>

54:15.586 --> 54:19.947
This is the best chance we'll ever have
to take our independence.

54:59.029 --> 55:00.998
Was it like this when you left?

55:02.032 --> 55:03.007
No.

55:14.845 --> 55:18.956
The revolution in Russia
has caused chaos everywhere!

55:19.016 --> 55:23.427
The Russians may have gone,
but we are still in danger.

55:23.487 --> 55:26.397
Brothers, come closer, please.

55:26.457 --> 55:29.518
I want to make the situation clear to you.

55:30.861 --> 55:35.439
Our town is surrounded by deserters
from the czar's armies.

55:35.499 --> 55:39.610
They're going village to village
killing everyone in their path.

55:39.670 --> 55:43.047
They've set fire to the oil fields
and are almost upon us,

55:43.107 --> 55:48.512
desperate and resolved to loot and
destroy our houses, rape our women.

55:49.947 --> 55:52.056
They outnumber us!

55:52.116 --> 55:54.711
And we have fewer weapons.

55:56.220 --> 56:00.431
I ask you to join us to defend our homes

56:00.491 --> 56:02.967
and keep the enemy from our door!

56:12.236 --> 56:15.070
You're back just when we need you most.

56:17.942 --> 56:19.672
Ali Khan.

56:20.478 --> 56:21.719
What happened to your eye?

56:21.779 --> 56:23.714
Piece of Russian shrapnel.

56:27.184 --> 56:31.962
So one day fighting for the Russians,
the next day fighting against them.

56:32.022 --> 56:34.832
At least they trained us.

56:34.892 --> 56:35.951
Come.

56:39.930 --> 56:41.839
We need to start preparing.

56:41.899 --> 56:44.575
The deserters will be here
in a matter of hours.

56:50.074 --> 56:54.752
Please, take these instruments
inside and sterilize them.

57:11.929 --> 57:14.572
Our job is to protect the old town.

57:14.632 --> 57:19.043
Nobody gets past us and nobody
fires until they get the order.

57:19.103 --> 57:21.299
Get ready. To your positions.

59:00.904 --> 59:02.964
Hey. Skkrsh.

59:18.956 --> 59:20.331
Now!

01:01:35.359 --> 01:01:37.157
Mehmed.

01:01:47.171 --> 01:01:48.503
Mehmed.

01:01:50.841 --> 01:01:52.149
What happened?

01:01:52.209 --> 01:01:54.217
Mehmed. Mehmed.

01:02:09.259 --> 01:02:10.300
We have to go.

01:02:10.810 --> 01:02:12.642
I have to fetch Nino.

01:02:33.217 --> 01:02:34.391
We have to leave.

01:02:34.451 --> 01:02:37.060
What? What about all the wounded?

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:38.362
The city's about to be destroyed.

01:02:38.422 --> 01:02:40.297
We have to leave.

01:02:44.628 --> 01:02:46.096
You all right?

01:02:47.898 --> 01:02:49.840
I'm staying here with Ilyas.

01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:51.508
You have to go with my father to Persia.

01:02:51.568 --> 01:02:55.078
- No, I want to stay with you.
- No, you can't.

01:02:55.138 --> 01:02:56.606
This fight isn't over yet.

01:03:00.444 --> 01:03:02.379
I'll call the baby Ali.

01:04:01.538 --> 01:04:03.313
This is Yahya Guli.

01:04:03.373 --> 01:04:05.171
He will show you to your quarters.

01:04:18.255 --> 01:04:20.063
Welcome to Persia, my lady.

01:04:20.123 --> 01:04:23.355
I am your eunuch. Please.

01:04:43.513 --> 01:04:45.004
Follow me, Princess.

01:05:34.765 --> 01:05:36.199
Please.

01:06:11.201 --> 01:06:15.679
I would think it must be very tiring

01:06:15.739 --> 01:06:18.299
to be the only wife of a young husband.

01:06:20.243 --> 01:06:24.187
But of course, all you have to
do when he gets too much for you

01:06:24.247 --> 01:06:28.425
is to send him off to the dancing boys.

01:06:30.353 --> 01:06:32.549
Has he ever given you a disease?

01:06:34.758 --> 01:06:35.748
No.

01:06:40.797 --> 01:06:42.789
You are very lucky with him.

01:06:47.871 --> 01:06:50.380
Wear this.

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:53.216
Wear, wear.

01:06:53.276 --> 01:06:56.542
It will protect you against any rival.

01:06:59.749 --> 01:07:00.842
Thank you.

01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:28.844
Any news?

01:07:47.931 --> 01:07:49.840
What are all these?

01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:52.375
I told you I don't want to wear a veil.

01:07:52.435 --> 01:07:54.177
I am sorry, Princess.

01:07:54.237 --> 01:07:57.447
I can't allow you to leave
the harem without one.

01:07:57.507 --> 01:07:58.941
What do you mean?

01:07:59.176 --> 01:08:01.151
I'm just going to the bazaar.

01:08:01.211 --> 01:08:04.654
You have to wear a veil.
It is the law of the land.

01:08:04.714 --> 01:08:07.524
I can't let you be arrested.

01:08:07.584 --> 01:08:08.950
Arrested?

01:08:14.424 --> 01:08:16.399
Then I'll stay in.

01:08:16.459 --> 01:08:17.801
I'll stay in.

01:08:17.861 --> 01:08:20.296
Please go.

01:08:21.598 --> 01:08:23.395
Thank you.

01:08:24.501 --> 01:08:26.402
Go. Get out.

01:08:42.953 --> 01:08:46.462
<i>It's been weeks
since I've heard from you, Ali.</i>

01:08:46.523 --> 01:08:48.287
<i>I'm so lonely here.</i>

01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:54.938
<i>Please come for me.</i>

01:08:54.997 --> 01:08:59.542
<i>I'm afraid my state of mind
can't be good for the baby.</i>

01:08:59.603 --> 01:09:02.245
<i>Promise you'll come as soon as you can.</i>

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:26.355
- Fatali Khan.
- Ali.

01:10:27.657 --> 01:10:30.667
- When did you get here?
- This afternoon.

01:10:30.727 --> 01:10:34.304
The National Council
have given me a job to do.

01:10:34.364 --> 01:10:36.006
What?

01:10:36.066 --> 01:10:40.777
Well, it's an announcement of a new country.

01:10:40.837 --> 01:10:43.747
Fatali Khan is here
to proclaim our independence.

01:10:43.807 --> 01:10:45.348
This is extraordinary.

01:10:48.411 --> 01:10:50.053
Yes!

01:11:02.025 --> 01:11:06.836
I declare the creation
of a new sovereign nation.

01:11:06.896 --> 01:11:11.074
It will guarantee civil and political rights

01:11:11.134 --> 01:11:12.709
to all its citizens,

01:11:12.769 --> 01:11:18.715
regardless of ethnic origin,
religion, class, or gender.

01:11:18.775 --> 01:11:21.618
The Azerbaijan Democratic Republic.

01:11:26.616 --> 01:11:30.850
Let us pledge allegiance here and say
aloud our promise to our new country.

01:11:32.422 --> 01:11:35.064
- Our flag is raised.
- Our flag is raised.

01:11:35.124 --> 01:11:38.534
- And it will never fall.
- And it will never fall.

01:12:32.182 --> 01:12:35.158
<i>I thought I'd lost you, Ali.</i>

01:12:35.218 --> 01:12:37.994
I thought I'd be here
for the rest of my life.

01:12:38.054 --> 01:12:40.864
- When can we go home?
- Not yet.

01:12:40.924 --> 01:12:42.866
But when the baby's born,
you'll be able to leave.

01:12:42.926 --> 01:12:45.935
I can't wait that long. I can't.

01:12:45.995 --> 01:12:48.772
I feel like a prisoner.

01:12:48.832 --> 01:12:52.175
I can't go out with you.
I can't receive guests.

01:12:52.235 --> 01:12:57.447
I can't go out to Tehran because
I'm not allowed to mix with unbelievers.

01:12:57.507 --> 01:12:59.203
Do you wonder I can't bear it here?

01:13:01.611 --> 01:13:04.487
And I can't stand that eunuch another day.

01:13:04.547 --> 01:13:09.192
He keeps wanting to paint my nails
and shave all the hair off my body.

01:13:09.252 --> 01:13:11.653
I don't want to see him ever again.

01:13:15.925 --> 01:13:17.655
And I don't want to see you either.

01:13:18.895 --> 01:13:20.261
So please...

01:13:22.131 --> 01:13:23.121
Please.

01:14:40.109 --> 01:14:41.818
What's more important to you?

01:14:41.878 --> 01:14:45.144
Your wife and child or your country?

01:15:15.244 --> 01:15:17.020
Ali Khan.

01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:18.688
It's a girl.

01:15:18.748 --> 01:15:20.307
It's a girl, Father.

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:28.064
Next time, it will be a boy.

01:15:32.395 --> 01:15:33.886
Hey.

01:15:39.936 --> 01:15:42.030
She's so beautiful.

01:16:10.266 --> 01:16:12.064
I love you.

01:16:15.872 --> 01:16:17.898
I love you too.

01:16:29.185 --> 01:16:30.660
<i>Will you come and join us soon?</i>

01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:34.364
No. I have decided to stay here.

01:16:34.424 --> 01:16:36.766
But what will you find to do in Tehran?

01:16:36.826 --> 01:16:38.454
I don't know.

01:16:38.695 --> 01:16:40.391
I will probably marry again.

01:16:43.466 --> 01:16:46.436
You should come back
when everything falls apart in Baku.

01:16:48.438 --> 01:16:51.047
What do you mean?

01:16:51.107 --> 01:16:53.349
I think you know what I mean.

01:16:53.409 --> 01:16:57.947
The war may be over,
but our troubles are only just beginning.

01:17:01.718 --> 01:17:04.427
Have a safe journey, my son.

01:17:04.487 --> 01:17:05.762
Good-bye, Father.

01:17:05.822 --> 01:17:07.154
Good-bye, my son.

01:18:05.248 --> 01:18:08.878
Make sure the rooms are allocated
as I explained to you.

01:18:09.952 --> 01:18:11.352
Prime Minister.

01:18:15.925 --> 01:18:18.801
We're like some blind,
helpless newborn creature

01:18:18.861 --> 01:18:22.939
trying to swim through shark-infested waters.

01:18:22.999 --> 01:18:26.401
Still, at least our neighbors
are respecting our independence.

01:18:27.904 --> 01:18:30.379
What worries me, Prime Minister,
is that we are a small country,

01:18:30.439 --> 01:18:33.382
and up there are 160 million Russians

01:18:33.442 --> 01:18:35.451
very thirsty for oil.

01:18:35.511 --> 01:18:37.503
You worry too much, Ali Khan.

01:18:54.997 --> 01:18:57.406
I thought I'd make you
deputy foreign minister.

01:18:57.466 --> 01:18:59.025
What do you think?

01:19:02.171 --> 01:19:04.814
Thank you, Prime Minister.

01:19:04.874 --> 01:19:06.816
I will do whatever you wish.

01:19:06.876 --> 01:19:08.936
Good. Then that's settled.

01:19:10.446 --> 01:19:14.824
We need to find a place to entertain
our diplomatic guests,

01:19:14.884 --> 01:19:18.150
and I am told you're redecorating.

01:19:20.122 --> 01:19:22.148
Yes, the palace should be ready in two weeks.

01:19:23.526 --> 01:19:26.602
Any chance you could make that a week?

01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:40.550
I was surprised to find
you have an opera house here.

01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:43.876
Yes. Quite a lot of us
can read and write as well.

01:19:46.449 --> 01:19:47.490
Sorry for interrupting.

01:19:47.550 --> 01:19:51.019
Ali, when you talked to the high
commissioner, what did he say?

01:19:52.255 --> 01:19:55.565
He said the Treaty of Versailles
is about to grant us full nationhood

01:19:55.625 --> 01:19:58.185
and guarantee diplomatic recognition.

01:20:00.196 --> 01:20:02.038
- Hmm.
- Thank you, darling.

01:20:02.098 --> 01:20:05.708
- To independence.
- To independence.

01:21:42.698 --> 01:21:46.396
They were not exaggerating
when they said 30,000 men.

01:21:47.303 --> 01:21:49.211
No.

01:21:49.271 --> 01:21:51.263
And I don't believe
they're here for their health.

01:21:55.244 --> 01:21:57.053
They can't do anything.

01:21:57.113 --> 01:21:59.422
The Treaty of Versailles says that...

01:21:59.482 --> 01:22:03.509
By the look of them, I'd say not too many
of them have read the Treaty of Versailles.

01:22:07.089 --> 01:22:09.058
No.

01:22:11.394 --> 01:22:14.470
The Russians aren't going
to march here just like that.

01:22:14.530 --> 01:22:17.606
Besides, they've just signed
a friendship treaty with us.

01:22:17.666 --> 01:22:20.609
- Then why are they massing on the border?
- Maneuvers, they say.

01:22:20.669 --> 01:22:24.046
Why have they chosen the closest possible
point to Baku for their maneuvers?

01:22:24.106 --> 01:22:25.574
They can be here in three hours.

01:22:26.809 --> 01:22:29.769
It's a bargaining ploy
to get us to lower the oil price.

01:22:31.547 --> 01:22:33.643
I think they want it for free.

01:22:37.253 --> 01:22:39.061
I'm happy. I'm happy.
I have a wonderful girl.

01:22:39.121 --> 01:22:40.713
She is a good girl.

01:22:40.773 --> 01:22:44.367
She is a good girl.
Now I'll live forever, yes?

01:22:48.464 --> 01:22:51.474
- You'll give me one wish?
- Tell me.

01:22:51.534 --> 01:22:54.410
- If I ask, you'll say yes?
- Depends.

01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:57.235
I want you to come home to Tbilisi with us.

01:23:00.176 --> 01:23:01.717
- No.
- But you have to.

01:23:01.777 --> 01:23:04.587
I want you to tell your husband
to leave this place.

01:23:04.647 --> 01:23:07.056
It's not safe.

01:23:07.116 --> 01:23:12.513
This man Lenin said the revolution
will not survive without Baku oil.

01:23:13.789 --> 01:23:15.382
They'll be coming for it.

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:45.515
Do you like it?

01:23:54.763 --> 01:23:57.198
Come here. Oh.

01:24:02.605 --> 01:24:03.846
- Ali Khan?
<i>- Yes, Ilyas.</i>

01:24:03.906 --> 01:24:05.848
The Bolsheviks have crossed the border.

01:24:05.908 --> 01:24:08.851
They've commandeered trains.
They're on their way to Baku.

01:24:08.911 --> 01:24:11.210
- <i>It's time to leave.</i>
- All right.

01:24:16.552 --> 01:24:17.918
We have to go.

01:25:32.494 --> 01:25:34.737
Prime Minister.

01:25:34.797 --> 01:25:38.574
I've just been informed
that the Bolsheviks are gaining on us.

01:25:38.634 --> 01:25:40.843
We'll make sure you escape across the border.

01:25:40.903 --> 01:25:43.913
We'll do whatever it takes to hold them off.

01:25:43.973 --> 01:25:45.373
Sir.

01:26:48.637 --> 01:26:52.848
Ilyas, I have known you for a very long time,

01:26:52.908 --> 01:26:55.718
and you have proved your great courage.

01:26:55.778 --> 01:26:56.905
I salute you.

01:26:59.581 --> 01:27:00.947
May Allah be with you.

01:27:11.226 --> 01:27:13.551
There's something I need to say to Ilyas.

01:27:20.502 --> 01:27:21.902
Ilyas.

01:27:51.667 --> 01:27:54.943
Nino, I'm going to stay with Ilyas
for a couple of days.

01:27:55.003 --> 01:27:56.699
To help him.

01:27:58.107 --> 01:28:01.383
No. No.

01:28:01.443 --> 01:28:02.775
- No, no, no, no, no.
- I have to.

01:28:04.646 --> 01:28:07.423
Ali...

01:28:07.483 --> 01:28:08.917
don't we mean anything to you?

01:28:10.919 --> 01:28:12.444
You mean everything.

01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:16.665
Look what happened last time
we were separated.

01:28:16.725 --> 01:28:18.567
It's not the same.

01:28:18.627 --> 01:28:22.123
You're not traveling to a strange country.
You're going to your parents.

01:28:24.900 --> 01:28:26.493
I have to do this, Nino.

01:28:28.637 --> 01:28:31.163
It will be our baby's country
when she grows up.

01:28:33.409 --> 01:28:34.900
It has to be defended.

01:28:43.519 --> 01:28:45.112
I'll be with you on Friday.

01:28:46.922 --> 01:28:48.185
Yeah.

01:28:49.958 --> 01:28:51.800
On Friday.

01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:53.556
And we'll go to Paris.

01:28:55.764 --> 01:28:57.198
For that honeymoon.

01:29:01.036 --> 01:29:04.980
And we'll have a house with a garden.

01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:06.133
Yes.

01:29:10.512 --> 01:29:13.175
And our next child will be a boy.

01:29:33.535 --> 01:29:34.843
Good-bye.

01:32:18.183 --> 01:32:19.891
Get down!
