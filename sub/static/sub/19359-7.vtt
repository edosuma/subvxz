WEBVTT

00:17.750 --> 00:18.583
I'm gonna have a baby.

00:19.208 --> 00:20.000
I'm into it.

00:20.875 --> 00:22.917
I can't believe how supportive
you're being. This is a shock.

00:22.917 --> 00:24.583
It kind of makes me
want to do it less.

00:25.333 --> 00:27.208
-ADAM: Who's the father?
-It's not important who it is.

00:27.208 --> 00:28.875
I don't know if I want him
to be part of the kid's life.

00:28.875 --> 00:30.959
-I might not even tell him.
-You can't do that.

00:30.959 --> 00:31.917
What's tomorrow?

00:32.333 --> 00:33.583
My mom's friend's birthday
in New Jersey.

00:33.583 --> 00:34.417
We've gone over this.

00:34.917 --> 00:37.667
Marnie, I told you
no more bullshit gigs!

00:37.667 --> 00:38.750
MARNIE: We need the money!

00:39.417 --> 00:41.875
Nothing about his life projects
the idea that he wants a child.

00:41.875 --> 00:42.792
Yo!

00:43.333 --> 00:45.083
ELIJAH'S COWORKER:
So, you walk in shell-shocked.

00:45.750 --> 00:46.417
Lavinia?

00:46.875 --> 00:47.959
Is something wrong?

00:48.625 --> 00:49.500
My whole life.

00:49.875 --> 00:51.458
I had one bad moment, and...

00:51.959 --> 00:53.000
now it's gone.

00:53.500 --> 00:55.083
Jesus, man. You're good!

00:55.458 --> 00:56.458
Oh, thanks.

01:03.458 --> 01:06.583
Why is your ex
trending so hard
on Twitter?

01:06.583 --> 01:08.083
'Cause Dill's the worst.

01:08.083 --> 01:10.625
Elijah,
please don't make me
click on a hashtag.

01:11.792 --> 01:12.959
Fine.

01:15.208 --> 01:18.208
He wants to adopt,
but he only wants
a white baby.

01:18.208 --> 01:21.667
And he got caught
trying to buy one
on the black market.

01:21.667 --> 01:23.208
Ew.

01:23.208 --> 01:26.000
Now I finally
get why you dumped
that sexy creep.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.291
Yeah.

01:27.291 --> 01:31.625
That's why
I straight up
ghosted his ass.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.125
Hey,

01:33.125 --> 01:35.041
um, would you...

01:35.041 --> 01:37.667
Oh, you'd look
so pretty in this.

01:37.667 --> 01:40.917
Would you cover
my shift tomorrow?

01:40.917 --> 01:44.250
You're never busy in advance,
just sick from your drugs.

01:44.250 --> 01:46.000
What you got?

01:46.000 --> 01:47.959
There's an open call.

01:47.959 --> 01:49.708
Since when
are you auditioning?

01:49.708 --> 01:51.792
I thought you were scared
you'd get too famous.

01:51.792 --> 01:53.375
Well, to be honest,
after college,

01:53.375 --> 01:55.458
I auditioned a bunch.

01:55.458 --> 01:58.333
I just wasn't
booking anything.

01:58.333 --> 02:00.583
I remember I went
on this audition

02:00.583 --> 02:02.250
for a commercial
for Papa John's.

02:02.250 --> 02:04.500
I had to say,
"They stuffed it!"

02:04.500 --> 02:07.041
It was for
the stuffed crust pizza.

02:07.041 --> 02:10.583
And after I left the room,
I heard the casting directors
laughing at me.

02:10.583 --> 02:14.125
I waited around
all day to say,
"They stuffed it,"

02:14.125 --> 02:16.041
and I just got laughed at.

02:16.041 --> 02:18.458
It was--
it was humiliating.

02:18.458 --> 02:20.875
Dude, that's being
an actor.

02:20.875 --> 02:23.041
90% of my auditions
go that way.

02:24.208 --> 02:26.125
What's the one
tomorrow for?

02:26.125 --> 02:28.750
It's for a workshop
of a new musical,

02:28.750 --> 02:30.500
"White Men Can't Jump!"

02:30.500 --> 02:32.875
Holy shit,
they made that
into a musical?

02:32.875 --> 02:33.834
Yeah.

02:33.834 --> 02:35.291
You're perfect for that.

02:35.291 --> 02:36.542
You think so?

02:36.542 --> 02:38.792
Of course.
You're the whitest guy
I know.

02:38.792 --> 02:40.250
Thank you.

02:41.333 --> 02:43.250
( music playing )

02:48.500 --> 02:50.500
Hi. I'm Elijah Krantz.

02:50.500 --> 02:52.333
- Hi, Elijah Krantz.
- No, don't talk.

02:52.333 --> 02:54.208
It's not a fucking
AA meeting, okay?
They don't talk.

02:54.208 --> 02:56.542
- I just talk.
- Got it.

02:56.542 --> 02:59.041
Hi, I'm Elijah Krantz.

03:00.917 --> 03:04.250
Well, I believe
in the soul,

03:04.250 --> 03:05.458
the cock,

03:05.458 --> 03:06.750
the pussy,

03:06.750 --> 03:08.917
the small
of a woman's back,

03:08.917 --> 03:10.542
the hangin' curveball...

03:10.542 --> 03:12.250
- ( phone buzzes )
- ...high fiber, good Scotch,

03:12.250 --> 03:13.792
that the novels
of Susan Sontag

03:13.792 --> 03:16.375
are self-indulgent,
overrated crap.

03:16.375 --> 03:18.250
Hannah, why are you
looking at your phone?

03:18.250 --> 03:19.792
( snaps fingers )

03:19.792 --> 03:22.417
I'm so sorry.
By the way, that was amazing.

03:22.417 --> 03:24.750
- You wrote that, right?
- Yeah, basically.

03:24.750 --> 03:25.875
I Googled it.

03:25.875 --> 03:27.750
What the fuck, Hannah?

03:27.750 --> 03:30.000
I'm sorry, it's just,
I'm waiting for Paul-Louis
to call me back.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.792
It's really stressful.
What if he wants to, like,
move in with us or something?

03:32.792 --> 03:35.083
- Ew.
- ( loud knocking )

03:36.625 --> 03:39.166
Do not let another
homeless woman in here,
please.

03:39.166 --> 03:41.125
She was fun.
You know it.

03:42.291 --> 03:44.291
Yes?

03:44.291 --> 03:45.750
Can I come in?

03:45.750 --> 03:47.250
Yeah.

03:47.250 --> 03:49.542
No. No!
Why are you here?

03:49.542 --> 03:51.875
Everywhere I go,
there's paparazzi.
They won't leave me alone.

03:51.875 --> 03:54.041
I just got in my car
and I started driving.

03:54.041 --> 03:58.125
And then my driver noted
that we were near your place
and I took that as a sign.

03:58.125 --> 04:01.250
I thought, this is probably
the only safe place for me
right now.

04:01.250 --> 04:05.166
Elijah: Well,
you've gotten yourself into
quite a predicament, Dillard.

04:05.166 --> 04:08.375
Just... making trouble.

04:08.375 --> 04:10.583
Yeah.
Look at you.

04:10.583 --> 04:13.166
Look at your sad
little outfit.

04:13.166 --> 04:15.959
Look at your sad outfit.
What happened to us?

04:15.959 --> 04:18.000
This is for
an audition, okay?

04:18.000 --> 04:21.250
I'm great.
Things are going great
right now for me.

04:21.250 --> 04:24.708
Why should I help you
with your white-baby-buying
scandal, huh?

04:24.708 --> 04:25.959
You're right.

04:27.166 --> 04:29.333
I'm sorry, Elijah.

04:29.333 --> 04:30.792
Break a leg.

04:32.500 --> 04:34.291
( mouthing words )
I don't know!

04:36.875 --> 04:38.834
Dill!

04:38.834 --> 04:40.875
( deeper voice )
Dill.

04:40.875 --> 04:43.458
- You can come in.
- Thank you.

04:43.458 --> 04:48.083
And I'm just kidding.
You look adorable in your
little gym outfit.

04:48.083 --> 04:50.458
I'm a street baller.

04:50.458 --> 04:51.834
Of course you are.

04:55.041 --> 04:59.000
Please wait in the kitchen
while I speak to Hannah
alone in the hall.

05:00.166 --> 05:01.166
Fuck!

05:01.166 --> 05:02.708
My whole day
is fucked right now!

05:02.708 --> 05:04.708
( whispers )
What the fuck
am I supposed to do?

05:04.708 --> 05:06.208
I feel like I just

05:06.208 --> 05:07.917
chugged a bunch
of Robitussin
or something.

05:07.917 --> 05:10.166
Listen, calm down, okay?
He's, like, nothing.

05:10.166 --> 05:11.583
He doesn't have
any power over you.

05:11.583 --> 05:13.208
He's not even
super sexy right now.

05:13.208 --> 05:14.667
- He's, like, sweaty--
- Just stop talking.

05:14.667 --> 05:15.667
Just do me a favor.

05:15.667 --> 05:17.500
Write down
everything he says.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.917
Write down everything he says,
particularly if it's about me.

05:19.917 --> 05:22.542
I have to go. I'm late.
( breathes deeply )

05:26.000 --> 05:27.583
I'm gonna have
my eye on you,

05:27.583 --> 05:29.375
even when it seems
like I don't.

05:29.375 --> 05:31.875
Just like the rest
of the fucking Internet.

05:33.208 --> 05:34.917
Do you have anything
to eat that doesn't have

05:34.917 --> 05:36.917
an activity center
on the back?

05:38.417 --> 05:40.542
( breathes deeply )

05:50.458 --> 05:52.333
What the fuck?

05:52.333 --> 05:54.417
Evie:
Hey, Marn.
Why are you wet?

05:54.417 --> 05:55.917
Because I went on a run.

05:55.917 --> 05:57.542
Why don't you just take
an Animal Flow class

05:57.542 --> 05:59.208
at Equinox
like a normal person?

05:59.208 --> 06:01.083
Well, funny you should ask,
because I had to cancel

06:01.083 --> 06:02.417
my Equinox membership

06:02.417 --> 06:04.083
and my CardioBoxFlo
membership

06:04.083 --> 06:05.500
and my Animal Yoga
membership

06:05.500 --> 06:07.375
because
I'm fucking broke.

06:07.375 --> 06:10.750
And also,
I'm fucking evicted,
so everything's great.

06:10.750 --> 06:13.667
Marnie, are you seriously
calling to ask for money?

06:13.667 --> 06:15.250
Mom, it's just
a small loan,

06:15.250 --> 06:16.917
just until I can
get in touch with Desi

06:16.917 --> 06:18.750
and figure out
what the fuck
is happening.

06:18.750 --> 06:21.917
I'm sorry.
I just can't give you
any more of my fun money.

06:21.917 --> 06:23.458
I've already booked
a trip to Montego Bay.

06:23.458 --> 06:25.041
What?

06:25.041 --> 06:27.333
It's in Jamaica,
and Sharva goes
every year.

06:27.333 --> 06:28.750
Are you fucking
serious, Mom?

06:28.750 --> 06:30.792
Oh, okay, fine.
Just enjoy yourself

06:30.792 --> 06:33.625
and totally don't
worry about your daughter,
who has nowhere to live.

06:33.625 --> 06:35.750
Well, I have
a perfectly good couch
for you to sleep on

06:35.750 --> 06:37.000
if you're really
that hard up.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.708
( groans )
Mom!

06:38.708 --> 06:41.125
And actually...
( gasps )

06:41.125 --> 06:44.083
this would give us
more time to rehearse
as The Michaels Sisters!

06:44.083 --> 06:47.375
Oh, my God, we are not
The Michaels Sisters!

06:47.375 --> 06:50.291
You know what? You're
basically forcing me to sell
my Sweet Sixteen necklace.

06:50.291 --> 06:52.959
How do you feel about that?
How does that sit with you, Mom?

06:52.959 --> 06:54.792
Don't let divorce
make you bitter.

06:54.792 --> 06:57.291
Oh, God, those nails.

07:04.458 --> 07:07.333
( chatter )

07:16.500 --> 07:17.959
Hi, there.

07:19.708 --> 07:21.000
Okay.

07:28.834 --> 07:31.542
Woman:
Elijah Krantz?

07:31.542 --> 07:33.333
Yeah, I'm here.

07:33.333 --> 07:34.792
We're ready for you.

07:34.792 --> 07:36.250
Oh, no.
I just got here.

07:36.250 --> 07:39.083
Great. We'll hear
your song now.

07:39.083 --> 07:40.542
But...

07:40.542 --> 07:41.708
( stammering )
I'm sorry--

07:41.708 --> 07:43.625
I thought the monologue
was first.

07:43.625 --> 07:45.041
It's not.

07:45.041 --> 07:47.375
Can I have, like, 30 seconds
to go to the bathroom?

07:47.375 --> 07:48.625
Not really.

07:48.625 --> 07:50.875
( stammering )
It's an emergency.

07:50.875 --> 07:52.417
Uh, not a bad
emergency.

07:52.417 --> 07:53.708
Just, like, a quick--
just a pee.

07:53.708 --> 07:56.291
Just a super quick--
I can't--

07:56.291 --> 07:57.542
Thank you.

08:28.166 --> 08:30.083
Oh. Good for you, honey.

08:30.083 --> 08:31.583
I'm getting the fuck
out of here.

08:31.583 --> 08:33.750
Where are you going?
The auditions are upstairs.

08:33.750 --> 08:34.917
( sighs )

08:34.917 --> 08:38.041
Yeah,
I-I-I gotta go.

08:38.041 --> 08:40.625
But you're in your
little basketball outfit.

08:40.625 --> 08:44.250
Yeah, I am.
Uh...

08:44.250 --> 08:46.583
Basically my ex showed up
at my place this morning

08:46.583 --> 08:49.667
and has just destroyed
this entire day for me.

08:49.667 --> 08:50.959
Fuck that.

08:50.959 --> 08:53.166
Men are only on this earth
to buy us jeans.

08:53.166 --> 08:55.250
I got to get out of here.
I can't go in that room

08:55.250 --> 08:57.750
and sing "Santa Fe"
from "Newsies" right now.

08:57.750 --> 09:00.708
Then don't sing "Santa Fe"
from "Newsies."

09:00.708 --> 09:03.458
Sing some shit that's
real to you right now.

09:03.458 --> 09:05.125
What's your name?

09:05.125 --> 09:06.792
Athena Dante.

09:06.792 --> 09:08.625
That is a great name.

09:08.625 --> 09:10.083
Yeah.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.291
What's yours?

09:11.291 --> 09:13.166
Elijah Krantz.

09:13.166 --> 09:15.000
Eh. It's a'ight.

09:15.000 --> 09:19.333
Well, it's been
working for me for
28-- 25-- 24 years.

09:24.583 --> 09:26.291
Hi.

09:26.291 --> 09:27.792
Hi.

09:27.792 --> 09:30.250
So, this is the most
valuable thing I own.

09:30.250 --> 09:33.000
Um, but I'm selling it
because my freedom

09:33.000 --> 09:38.625
is more precious to me
than a precious locket
from the 1870s.

09:38.625 --> 09:41.375
So... here goes.

09:41.375 --> 09:44.250
"Wild Bill" Hickok gave that
to my great-great-grandmother.

09:44.250 --> 09:47.375
I come from
a long line of women
who choose terrible men,

09:47.375 --> 09:49.708
but that's ending now.

09:49.708 --> 09:51.667
Isn't it beautiful?

09:51.667 --> 09:53.583
It's plated pewter.

09:53.583 --> 09:55.834
You can see
where the plating
has chipped away.

09:55.834 --> 09:57.041
Oh, no, no.

09:57.041 --> 09:58.792
It's actually
gold-plated platinum.

09:58.792 --> 10:00.291
Apparently it used to be
really common.

10:00.291 --> 10:02.458
They'd put the more valuable
metal underneath.

10:02.458 --> 10:04.333
So this platinum
is so fine,

10:04.333 --> 10:07.208
that they literally
needed solid gold
just to protect it.

10:07.208 --> 10:10.166
No, I'm certain
that's not true.

10:10.166 --> 10:13.500
It has a spring
lobster clasp.

10:13.500 --> 10:15.000
This...

10:15.000 --> 10:16.667
is less than 20 years old.

10:16.667 --> 10:19.125
So, what are you telling me?
That my mom lied to me?

10:21.291 --> 10:23.375
Holy shit!

10:23.375 --> 10:26.250
My mom lied to me
when I was 16

10:26.250 --> 10:27.750
and I still believe it.

10:29.083 --> 10:30.583
She fucking lied to me!

10:30.583 --> 10:35.125
I bet none of my ancestors
were ever even in the Wild West.

10:35.125 --> 10:38.000
Half my fucking
wedding theme
is a lie.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.375
Jesus Christ.

10:42.375 --> 10:45.250
Fuck.
Okay, I have
to sell these, then.

10:48.291 --> 10:51.291
My dad gave these to me
when I got into college.

10:51.291 --> 10:52.375
( scraping )

10:52.375 --> 10:54.375
My diamond!
Fuck!

10:54.375 --> 10:55.792
Glass.

10:55.792 --> 10:57.583
Everyone in my family
is fucking lying garbage!

10:57.583 --> 10:59.125
Every single person!

10:59.125 --> 11:01.917
No wonder I married someone
just as bad as they are,

11:01.917 --> 11:03.708
because it's
all I fucking know.

11:03.708 --> 11:06.708
And now, I'm, like,
on the precipice
of homelessness

11:06.708 --> 11:10.083
and all I've ever done
to anybody is love them.

11:10.083 --> 11:12.417
All I've ever done
is love somebody,

11:12.417 --> 11:15.000
and now I'm fucking here.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.417
What the fuck!

11:16.417 --> 11:18.208
Did you just roll
your eyes at me, sir?

11:18.208 --> 11:19.834
( chuckles )
I assure you, I did not.

11:19.834 --> 11:22.250
Well, I may not know
the difference between
gold and pewter,

11:22.250 --> 11:23.875
but I'm not
a fucking moron.

11:23.875 --> 11:25.542
You just rolled
your eyes at me.

11:25.542 --> 11:28.583
Listen, lady.
Please?

11:28.583 --> 11:30.542
I'm not leaving
until you tell me why.

11:30.542 --> 11:32.458
Why'd you do it?

11:34.625 --> 11:38.250
It sounds to me
like you're doing
a lot of blaming.

11:38.250 --> 11:40.583
Your mother, your father,
your husband.

11:40.583 --> 11:42.583
But nobody ever
walks in here

11:42.583 --> 11:44.583
to sell things
off their body

11:44.583 --> 11:45.917
who has done
nothing wrong.

11:45.917 --> 11:48.792
You know who comes
into pawn shops?

11:48.792 --> 11:50.750
Junkies, thieves,

11:50.750 --> 11:52.875
dentists who have
lost their license

11:52.875 --> 11:54.500
because of sexual abuse,

11:54.500 --> 11:56.291
babysitters who have
affairs with the men--

11:56.291 --> 11:57.875
Jesus, dude.
Stop. Stop.

11:57.875 --> 11:59.291
Stop.
I get it.

11:59.291 --> 12:01.792
Do you?

12:01.792 --> 12:03.125
Get it?

12:06.583 --> 12:08.875
The liar...

12:08.875 --> 12:10.417
is you.

12:17.625 --> 12:20.125
Woman:
He wants me to go outside
and play soccer with him.

12:20.125 --> 12:22.792
Like, in the park.
Oh, I hate it.

12:22.792 --> 12:24.375
- Don't laugh, I hate it.
- Hi.

12:24.375 --> 12:26.750
I mean, the worst--

12:26.750 --> 12:27.959
Hello.

12:27.959 --> 12:29.458
I'm Elijah Krantz.

12:29.458 --> 12:33.166
Hi, Elijah Krantz.
What will you be singing?

12:33.166 --> 12:35.834
I will be singing
"Let Me Be Your Star"

12:35.834 --> 12:38.000
from the hit show
"Bombshell"

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
from the hit TV show
"Smash."

12:48.583 --> 12:51.166

13:25.583 --> 13:28.375
Okay. You can stay
for the monologue.

13:38.792 --> 13:40.625
How far along are you?

13:40.625 --> 13:42.542
Excuse me?

13:42.542 --> 13:46.500
I have 14 Emmys.
I know when someone's
keeping a secret from me.

13:46.500 --> 13:49.500
Don't worry.
I don't want
to buy your baby.

13:49.500 --> 13:52.375
Good, 'cause I don't
want to sell my baby, so.

13:54.875 --> 13:56.667
I'm only, like,
three months.

13:56.667 --> 13:58.375
I haven't even
told the father yet.

13:58.375 --> 14:00.083
You're afraid
he won't support you.

14:00.083 --> 14:02.917
No. I don't know if I want
him to support me.

14:02.917 --> 14:04.708
I don't even know
if I want him to be
involved.

14:04.708 --> 14:06.917
- I didn't want to make
this phone call.
- Whoa, whoa.

14:06.917 --> 14:09.625
Hannah.

14:09.625 --> 14:11.750
I like to live a life
of acceptance,

14:11.750 --> 14:14.333
to flout tradition
when I can,

14:14.333 --> 14:15.875
but there's
one thing I know--

14:15.875 --> 14:18.166
babies need fathers.

14:18.166 --> 14:19.542
Mine left
when I was three.

14:19.542 --> 14:21.708
Just got up and followed
the maharishi.

14:21.708 --> 14:24.583
It left me
totally incapable

14:24.583 --> 14:28.125
of accepting
divine male love.

14:29.500 --> 14:31.417
I'm broken.

14:32.834 --> 14:34.917
You're broken and you
thought you would fix it

14:34.917 --> 14:36.625
by buying a white baby?

14:36.625 --> 14:38.333
Yeah, that's exactly
what I thought.

14:38.333 --> 14:42.125
I was gonna
father that baby

14:42.125 --> 14:45.291
because I couldn't
father myself.

14:45.291 --> 14:47.750
Okay, well,
what about moms?

14:47.750 --> 14:50.417
- Aren't moms important?
- Uh, for six months.

14:50.417 --> 14:52.208
Listen, Hannah, you need
to think about the effect

14:52.208 --> 14:53.834
that this could have
on your child.

14:53.834 --> 14:56.291
What they might miss.

14:56.291 --> 15:00.166
They could find themselves
alone, aging,

15:00.166 --> 15:04.583
embroiled in a public
scandal in Queens

15:04.583 --> 15:06.959
in an ex-lover's
squat house.

15:06.959 --> 15:09.750
Okay, we're
in Brooklyn right now
and this is an apartment.

15:09.750 --> 15:12.458
It just sounds
so much sadder when
you try to defend it.

15:12.458 --> 15:16.458
- ( phone chimes )
- He drank my fucking LaCroix.

15:16.458 --> 15:18.583
You need to stop
checking on your ex, man.

15:18.583 --> 15:21.250
- He's gonna
get to your head!
- He is in my head.

15:21.250 --> 15:23.208
He drank
all the LaCroix
in my head.

15:23.208 --> 15:26.291
( sighs )
Good dick is a prison.

15:26.291 --> 15:28.375
All right,
listen up, kids!
I got a list.

15:28.375 --> 15:31.625
- All right, Allen...
- Yes!

15:31.625 --> 15:33.291
- ...Micucci...
- ( cheering )

15:33.291 --> 15:35.000
- ...Frances...
- Yes!

15:35.000 --> 15:36.834
...Dunnigan,

15:36.834 --> 15:39.875
Eldridge, Kang,

15:39.875 --> 15:42.834
Jared, Zinman,

15:42.834 --> 15:45.959
Gillan, Villepique,

15:45.959 --> 15:47.625
McMillan.

15:47.625 --> 15:49.625
Tony:
Okay,

15:49.625 --> 15:52.500
so if she said
your name,

15:52.500 --> 15:53.500
you can go home.

15:53.500 --> 15:54.708
Thank you so much.

15:54.708 --> 15:55.917
And the rest of you
can head into the studio

15:55.917 --> 15:57.125
for the dance portion.

15:57.125 --> 15:59.291
- ( people gasping )
- He flipped it!

15:59.291 --> 16:00.917
He fucking flipped it.

16:00.917 --> 16:02.500
Mm, I love that move.
Classic.

16:02.500 --> 16:05.000
Yeah, "A Chorus Line."
Best show ever.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.875
I love this
bitchy business so much.

16:06.875 --> 16:09.375
( both squealing )

16:13.959 --> 16:15.542
Well, that's easy.

16:15.542 --> 16:16.708
( phone chiming )

16:20.250 --> 16:23.250
Well, gotta take
this call.

16:28.583 --> 16:30.041
Hello?

16:30.041 --> 16:31.875
Yeah,
this is Paul-Louis.

16:31.875 --> 16:33.875
Hey, Paul-Louis.
This is Hannah.

16:33.875 --> 16:35.458
We met a few months ago.

16:35.458 --> 16:38.667
I was writing the article
about the surf camp.

16:39.917 --> 16:42.542
I threw up in your bed.

16:42.542 --> 16:45.125
You said I had, like,
a lot of pubic hair.

16:45.125 --> 16:47.375
Oh, Hannah!
( chuckles )

16:47.375 --> 16:49.667
Hey, what's up, girl?

16:49.667 --> 16:51.417
Hey, yeah,
I just wanna preface this

16:51.417 --> 16:53.583
by saying this is
a real no-pressure sitch.

16:53.583 --> 16:56.917
You know, I'm just
kind of doing my moral
and ethical duty

16:56.917 --> 16:59.583
to keep you informed
and let you know that
I'm pregnant.

17:00.625 --> 17:01.875
From when we had sex.

17:01.875 --> 17:03.750
So, from the sex we had,
I got pregnant

17:03.750 --> 17:07.040
and I'm gonna be having
that child.

17:11.458 --> 17:12.791
Whoa.

17:14.040 --> 17:16.416
Uh, whoa.

17:20.208 --> 17:21.750
Okay,
what do you need?

17:21.750 --> 17:24.290
Uh, need?
I don't need anything.

17:24.290 --> 17:25.959
No, I know you're
at the beginning

17:25.959 --> 17:28.708
of, like, a very
exciting and illustrious
water skiing career,

17:28.708 --> 17:31.750
and I'm not
interested in creating
any problems for you.

17:31.750 --> 17:32.625
Wow.

17:34.041 --> 17:37.500
Wow, ooh,
are you serious?
( chuckles )

17:37.500 --> 17:39.083
( exhales )

17:40.375 --> 17:41.667
That's really kind
of you.

17:41.667 --> 17:43.417
That's so cool.

17:43.417 --> 17:47.417
Uh, because I'm not
really ready to--
to have a kid.

17:47.417 --> 17:48.959
And I feel like a POS

17:48.959 --> 17:50.542
telling you to get
an abortion or whatever.

17:50.542 --> 17:52.083
I mean,
that's not my place.

17:52.083 --> 17:53.458
( stammering )
That's-- that's not fair.

17:53.458 --> 17:55.125
I'm not, um...

17:59.625 --> 18:03.458
Um, well, thanks
for telling me, I guess.

18:03.458 --> 18:05.750
Yeah, everyone said it was,
like, so important.

18:05.750 --> 18:08.834
Now I feel like
maybe it was a mistake.

18:08.834 --> 18:10.667
Oh, no. No.
Hey, you know what?

18:10.667 --> 18:12.667
I don't even believe
in mistakes.

18:12.667 --> 18:14.417
I really don't.

18:14.417 --> 18:15.375
Uh...

18:16.875 --> 18:18.834
Okay.

18:18.834 --> 18:21.500
No, cool.
Well, uh-- well, good luck.

18:21.500 --> 18:24.333
Absolutely.
I'll definitely
keep you in the loop

18:24.333 --> 18:26.458
if anything major
goes on.

18:26.458 --> 18:28.500
Or I don't have to.

18:28.500 --> 18:31.750
It'll only be if that was
something you wanted.

18:31.750 --> 18:33.959
Cool. Cool.

18:33.959 --> 18:35.667
Um, hey, you know

18:35.667 --> 18:39.667
a name I always thought
was cool for a boy
was Grover.

18:41.333 --> 18:44.000
Uh, okay.
So, all right,
I'll go now.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.166
Unless you want
to talk more.

18:46.166 --> 18:48.417
I mean, I don't want
to be a dick about it
if you wanted...

18:48.417 --> 18:51.375
No, no.
I got out everything
I needed to say.

18:51.375 --> 18:52.417
Thank you.

18:55.500 --> 18:56.917
Well, be good, Hannah.

19:03.208 --> 19:06.000
Dill:
Sounds like he didn't
have much to say.

19:07.625 --> 19:09.875
Sounds like
he dismissed you...

19:11.458 --> 19:13.750
the way I dismissed
Elijah.

19:15.542 --> 19:17.875
No, it went perfectly.

19:19.750 --> 19:21.959
He doesn't want a kid,
so he's not gonna bother me,

19:21.959 --> 19:24.041
so that's
what I wanted.

19:25.375 --> 19:27.458
I wanted it to be easy
and it was easy,

19:27.458 --> 19:30.250
so I guess it's
just a little sad...

19:30.250 --> 19:32.417
- Shh.
- ...how easy it was.

19:32.417 --> 19:35.083
Shh.

19:35.083 --> 19:36.917
It's okay.

19:36.917 --> 19:39.959
I guess I just thought
I could be this, like,
brave, cool, young mom

19:39.959 --> 19:44.083
with, like, tattoos and, like,
a whole, like, you know,
cool approach to things,

19:44.083 --> 19:47.083
- and now I'm just feeling...
- ( sobbing )

19:54.583 --> 19:56.542
What are you
crying about?

19:56.542 --> 19:59.625
It's just--
it's just--

19:59.625 --> 20:01.542
it's just the same shit.

20:01.542 --> 20:03.208
You know, sweetie?

20:03.208 --> 20:05.750
It's-- we're just--
we're just children.

20:05.750 --> 20:09.542
We're just-- we're just
naked children.
( crying )

20:12.458 --> 20:15.166
( both sobbing )

20:25.542 --> 20:27.625
Reviewing that part
one last time.

20:27.625 --> 20:30.917
It's window, front,

20:30.917 --> 20:32.625
one, and, look, two,

20:32.625 --> 20:34.667
up, three, and four,

20:34.667 --> 20:36.333
five,
double pirouette,

20:36.333 --> 20:38.250
- then jump.
- ( mouthing ) Jump.

20:38.250 --> 20:39.875
Great! Music.

20:39.875 --> 20:41.625
( music playing )

20:45.375 --> 20:48.500
- Woman: And five,
six, seven, eight!
- ( whistle trills )

Nice!
Really great stuff, guys.

21:30.583 --> 21:32.291
Let's bring
the basketballs in.

21:33.542 --> 21:35.208
( music resumes )

21:36.542 --> 21:38.041
( whistle trills )

21:52.291 --> 21:53.375
Oh, sorry, sorry!

21:55.125 --> 21:56.041
Oh, G--!

21:57.125 --> 21:58.583
Man:
Yeah.

21:58.583 --> 22:01.583
- Men: Yeah! Whoo!
- Why?!

22:06.375 --> 22:07.875
- Oh!
- Sorry!

22:12.667 --> 22:15.333
Yeah, still counts.
Whoo!

22:15.333 --> 22:17.750

22:25.333 --> 22:28.333

- Ugh, man, you stunk up
the joint.

22:28.333 --> 22:29.792
I know.

22:29.792 --> 22:32.250
The last time
I touched a basketball
was the sixth grade

22:32.250 --> 22:34.291
where, then, I literally
only touched it.

22:34.291 --> 22:36.917
Then why the fuck you try out
for a basketball musical?

22:36.917 --> 22:40.583
Because I thought
the whole point was white guys
aren't good at basketball.

22:40.583 --> 22:43.083
Hey, what you doing now?

22:43.083 --> 22:44.500
You wanna
go to Starbucks?

22:44.500 --> 22:46.708
I get 30% off all snacks
that aren't seasonal.

22:46.708 --> 22:49.041
- Do you work
at Starbucks?
- No.

22:49.041 --> 22:50.667
( chuckles )

22:50.667 --> 22:53.291
I wish I was younger
so we could hang out
and it's not weird,

22:53.291 --> 22:56.417
but it feels weird.
( chuckles )

22:56.417 --> 22:57.583
I'm sorry.

22:57.583 --> 22:59.208
Plus, I have to go back
to my apartment

22:59.208 --> 23:01.083
and make sure my ex-boyfriend
didn't kill himself, so.

23:01.083 --> 23:02.417
He's still
at your house?

23:02.417 --> 23:05.375
Yes, but only
because he's hiding

23:05.375 --> 23:07.583
from the "Daily Mail"
or whatnot.

23:07.583 --> 23:09.166
Bullshit.

23:09.166 --> 23:10.625
Dudes can go anywhere.

23:10.625 --> 23:12.500
There's nothing
but places to hide
in this city.

23:13.917 --> 23:15.583
He loves you.
Rawr!

23:15.583 --> 23:17.667
- No, no, no.
- Yeah.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.708
I'll see you
at another audition, huh?

23:20.708 --> 23:22.166
Or maybe at rehearsal.

23:22.166 --> 23:24.458
- ( scoffs )
Yeah, okay.
- Hey!

23:25.500 --> 23:27.667
I might get cast
in this show.

23:27.667 --> 23:31.000
I nailed the first two parts
of that audition.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.750
And then how hard
can it be to--

23:32.750 --> 23:35.250
to spin a fucking basketball
on your finger, right?

23:35.250 --> 23:37.708
I can learn that.
I could learn a new skill.

23:37.708 --> 23:40.917
Reese Witherspoon
learned how to sing
for "Walk the Line,"

23:40.917 --> 23:43.125
and she won
a goddamn Oscar.

23:43.125 --> 23:44.875
I can do this.

23:44.875 --> 23:46.834
Because you know why,
Athena Dante?

23:46.834 --> 23:48.959
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

23:48.959 --> 23:52.291
I'm really, really
fucking talented.

23:52.291 --> 23:55.125
I'm as talented
as you say you are.
That's how talented I am.

23:55.125 --> 23:56.500
Exactly.

23:56.500 --> 23:58.542
That's how
you gotta be, man.

23:58.542 --> 24:00.333
It's never too late.

24:00.333 --> 24:02.291
Fuck you.
I'm not that old.

24:02.291 --> 24:04.000
Too old to be going
to open calls.

24:05.333 --> 24:07.166
You little bitch.

24:11.959 --> 24:15.000
- ( TV playing )
- ( both laughing )

24:15.000 --> 24:17.667
You don't think
it's gonna be so good,
the baby's talking,

24:17.667 --> 24:19.667
- but it's just like--
- Mm, Kirstie...

24:21.458 --> 24:23.041
Honey, how'd it go?

24:23.041 --> 24:25.500
Dill got us eight pizzas.
The pepperoni's in
the bathroom.

24:25.500 --> 24:26.917
Why are you still here?

24:26.917 --> 24:29.875
I'm here 'cause I have
something to say to you.

24:31.458 --> 24:33.834
( sighs )
There's nothing like
a public shaming

24:33.834 --> 24:37.041
to make you realize
what's really important.

24:37.041 --> 24:38.959
I cast you aside

24:38.959 --> 24:41.417
when all you wanted to do
was love me.

24:42.875 --> 24:45.291
It's funny, I thought
I came here to hide out,

24:45.291 --> 24:47.333
but I think for
the first time in my life

24:47.333 --> 24:49.750
I'm ready
to stop hiding.

24:49.750 --> 24:51.542
- Elijah--
- Oh, okay.

24:51.542 --> 24:53.208
All right, um...
( chuckles )

24:53.208 --> 24:56.667
Dill, just save it
for somebody who cares
about current events.

24:56.667 --> 24:57.959
Okay?

24:57.959 --> 24:59.750
You came here
to fuck with me.

25:01.375 --> 25:03.000
That's why
you came here,

25:03.000 --> 25:06.041
to fuck with me
the same way that
you fuck with everybody.

25:06.041 --> 25:09.291
But guess what.
You can't fuck with
me anymore, okay?

25:09.291 --> 25:11.417
I'm "unfuckable" now.

25:11.417 --> 25:15.417
So, yes, you might've
thrown me a little bit
when you showed up,

25:15.417 --> 25:18.583
but not anymore.

25:18.583 --> 25:20.417
'Cause I--
I took my ball,

25:20.417 --> 25:22.083
and I marched
down that court,

25:22.083 --> 25:24.125
and I fucking
dunked it.

25:24.125 --> 25:26.041
Those are sports terms

25:26.041 --> 25:30.125
and I'm using them because
I am my own teammate now.

25:30.125 --> 25:31.625
Me.

25:32.750 --> 25:34.083
Bam.

25:35.458 --> 25:36.708
So...

25:37.750 --> 25:40.917
good luck
with your white baby.

25:40.917 --> 25:42.917
( TV continues playing )

25:48.792 --> 25:52.333
Elijah:
Dill, could you please
bring a pizza in here?

25:59.667 --> 26:01.792
Hey, Desi.
It's Marnie.

26:01.792 --> 26:05.333
Um, I just wanted
to let you know

26:05.333 --> 26:09.708
that I'm assuming responsibility
for my own life.

26:09.708 --> 26:13.458
And don't worry about
sending me any money for rent

26:13.458 --> 26:16.792
because I will be
moving in with my mom.

26:20.166 --> 26:22.333
You don't
owe me anything

26:22.333 --> 26:25.333
and I'm really sorry
that I thought you did.

26:27.542 --> 26:32.333
Okay, um, I genuinely hope
you're doing well.

26:32.333 --> 26:33.792
Bye.

26:33.792 --> 26:36.667
( phone buzzing )

26:36.667 --> 26:40.375
( scoffs )
Fuck you, Mom.

26:45.708 --> 26:47.083
This is
Elijah Krantz.

26:47.083 --> 26:48.542
Elijah, hi.

26:48.542 --> 26:51.458
- Um, it's Tony and Patty...
- Patty and Tony!

26:51.458 --> 26:54.208
...from
the soon-to-be hit musical
"White Men Can't Jump!"

26:54.208 --> 26:57.333
- Yeah.
- So, I'm just gonna
cut right to the chase.

26:58.875 --> 27:00.834
You cannot dance
for shit.

27:00.834 --> 27:02.917
- We don't give a fuck.
- Patty: No, I don't care.

27:02.917 --> 27:05.333
I don't care.
You have an element,
this essence,

27:05.333 --> 27:07.625
and we really would like
for you to come in and read
for our producers.

27:07.625 --> 27:10.083
- Just read the scene.
- Tony: Read the scene.
No balls.

27:10.083 --> 27:12.041
Patty:
Mm, and the way you sang?
Beautiful.

27:12.041 --> 27:13.917
Just tell them
you forgot your ball.

27:13.917 --> 27:17.041
Tony:
Absolutely no balls.
We'll see you soon.

27:17.041 --> 27:19.500
Woman:
All righty, so Dr. Kruskal
will see you in a few minutes.

27:19.500 --> 27:21.542

ADAM: I don't wanna be saying
all this, Jessa,

29:09.917 --> 29:11.083
but I have to explore it.

29:11.417 --> 29:13.333
I'm not sure what Hannah's
gonna even say,

29:13.333 --> 29:15.834
-but I know what I'm gonna say.
-You gotta do what you gotta do.

29:18.667 --> 29:20.125
ADAM: Look, Hannah,
we have a lot of history

29:20.125 --> 29:21.291
-that we can't seem to erase.
-(STORE BELL CHIMES)

29:22.625 --> 29:23.792
ADAM:
We can't let each other go,

29:24.000 --> 29:25.291
as much as we try.

29:26.333 --> 29:27.667
I thought I could move on,

29:27.667 --> 29:29.166
but we don't have
any more time to waste.

29:31.083 --> 29:32.208
Can we go to your house?

29:33.166 --> 29:35.000
I'm so confused.

29:39.667 --> 29:40.583
I'm broken.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.875
You're broken, and you thought
you would fix it

29:42.875 --> 29:44.625
by buying a white baby?

29:46.083 --> 29:47.834
"Bounce" is
an exciting episode of Girls

29:47.834 --> 29:49.417
written by Tami Sagher
and Murray Miller.

29:49.417 --> 29:52.125
And what we were thrilled about
is that we had plans

29:52.125 --> 29:55.333
for multiple seasons
to do an all-Elijah...

29:55.708 --> 29:57.291
-An all-Elijah episode.
-Yeah.

29:57.291 --> 29:58.333
And this was our dream,

29:58.750 --> 30:01.542
and to finally actually
showcase the full talents

30:01.542 --> 30:02.542
of Andrew Rannells...

30:03.250 --> 30:04.625
LENA DUNHAM: And it felt like
it was time to really show that,

30:05.000 --> 30:07.291
like, Elijah does have talent,
and he's not delusional,

30:07.291 --> 30:09.542
and, like, he actually
has something to offer.

30:09.542 --> 30:12.166
Like, I find the moment when
he sings "Let Me Be Your Star,"

30:12.166 --> 30:13.834
it's, like, actually
really beautiful and moving.

30:13.834 --> 30:18.375
-JENNI KONNER: Yeah.
-(ELIJAH HOLDING NOTE)

30:18.375 --> 30:20.834
DUNHAM:
Andrew described what it feels
like to, like, give it your all

30:20.834 --> 30:22.875
and then have the
people literally eating chips

30:22.875 --> 30:23.875
in the audience.

30:24.208 --> 30:26.542
Okay. You can stay
for the monologue.

30:27.375 --> 30:29.375
And what's fun is that
we kind of juxtaposed him

30:29.375 --> 30:31.041
with this character,
Athena Dante.

30:31.041 --> 30:32.542
Clearly, you're here
for the auditions.

30:32.750 --> 30:33.875
Fuck, yeah!

30:34.166 --> 30:36.208
Who has, like,
all the confidence in the world.

30:36.208 --> 30:37.417
You can't buy that confidence.

30:37.834 --> 30:39.083
And we liked the idea
that he would have this, like,

30:39.375 --> 30:41.083
kind of sort of spirit guide
at the audition.

30:41.083 --> 30:43.750
-(SIGHS)
-Good dick is a prison.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.291
And then, of course,
Dill show up

30:46.500 --> 30:50.375
to disarm and confuse Elijah
before it's time

30:50.375 --> 30:51.500
for his audition.

30:51.500 --> 30:53.375
Look at your sad little outfit.

30:53.375 --> 30:56.000
Look at your sad outfit.
What happened to us?

30:56.000 --> 30:58.083
KONNER: Dill was
really critical to Elijah.

30:58.083 --> 31:00.000
I think he kind of
flattened him.

31:00.000 --> 31:03.417
And so we wanted to offer
the characters closure.

31:03.417 --> 31:05.417
What was nice for Elijah
was that he got

31:05.417 --> 31:06.625
to have the upper-hand
for a minute.

31:06.917 --> 31:08.417
Yes, you might have
thrown me a little bit

31:08.417 --> 31:11.708
when you showed up, but...
not anymore.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.959
KONNER:
We got the chance to kind of

31:14.959 --> 31:17.333
have Elijah have that moment.

31:19.417 --> 31:20.625
ELIJAH: (CALLS OUT) Dill?

31:20.875 --> 31:23.083
Could you please bring
a pizza in here?

31:23.917 --> 31:26.125
-Hello?
-Yeah? This is Paul-Louis.

31:26.291 --> 31:28.458
Hey, yeah, I just wanna preface
this by saying

31:28.458 --> 31:30.625
this is a real no-pressure
sitch. Um...

31:30.792 --> 31:32.625
So, from the sex we had,
I got pregnant,

31:32.625 --> 31:34.917
and, and, um, I'm gonna be
having that child.

31:35.125 --> 31:37.959
Woah... Oh... Are,
are you serious? (CHUCKLES)

31:38.250 --> 31:40.125
Because I'm not
really ready to...

31:40.125 --> 31:41.291
to have a kid.

31:41.667 --> 31:43.625
I think there was a part of her
that hated the idea

31:43.625 --> 31:44.708
that he would try
to be in her life,

31:45.417 --> 31:48.375
and part of her that was hoping
desperately that it would just

31:48.375 --> 31:51.708
you know, be another, um,
way to, like, cement her status

31:51.708 --> 31:54.834
as a human being. And so
to hear him sort of react

31:54.834 --> 31:57.333
so nonchalantly... It take...
She's taken aback

31:57.333 --> 31:59.000
by how painful it is.

31:59.417 --> 32:01.000
And there was something
really special about having

32:01.208 --> 32:03.792
Dill and Hannah interact,
because, in Hannah's mind...

32:04.166 --> 32:06.250
I think she thinks, like,
if you're successful,

32:06.250 --> 32:08.000
you don't have problems.
Like her...

32:08.000 --> 32:10.166
And so to be sobbed on
by, like,

32:10.166 --> 32:11.792
whatever the city's
top news anchor...

32:11.792 --> 32:13.000
It's like a real moment
of awake...

32:13.417 --> 32:15.250
She's like, "Oh, it hurts
to be all of us."

32:15.250 --> 32:17.458
(BOTH SOB)

32:18.208 --> 32:20.083
DUNHAM: People's stereotype
of millennials is, like,

32:20.083 --> 32:21.417
they feel like
they deserve everything

32:21.417 --> 32:22.792
that they haven't worked for.

32:22.792 --> 32:24.375
And, like, Marnie's
being evicted

32:24.375 --> 32:25.834
and Desi hasn't been paying
the rent,

32:26.083 --> 32:29.083
and her first reaction is
to blame him, even though

32:29.083 --> 32:32.083
he doesn't live there,
and then to blame her mother,

32:32.083 --> 32:33.500
who refuses to give her
the money,

32:33.875 --> 32:35.834
then to blame her father
because he didn't give her

32:35.834 --> 32:37.125
a real gold locket.

32:37.500 --> 32:40.083
"Wild Bill" Hickok gave that
to my great great grandmother.

32:40.083 --> 32:42.250
Yeah... I'm certain
that's not true.

32:42.500 --> 32:45.542
This... is less than
twenty years old.

32:45.750 --> 32:47.917
Everyone in my family
is fucking lying garbage!

32:47.917 --> 32:49.708
DUNHAM: And then to finally come
to the conclusion at the end,

32:49.708 --> 32:52.208
like, "Okay, you're right.
I don't have a job,

32:52.208 --> 32:54.375
I don't have a locket.
I don't have a husband.

32:54.375 --> 32:56.208
I guess I gotta live
with my mom."
