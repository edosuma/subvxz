01:56.787 --> 01:59.119
No, please! No! Please!

02:00.458 --> 02:01.788
Davey!

02:02.293 --> 02:04.286
- Come running, lad!
- Please don't!

02:06.132 --> 02:08.622
- Stop it!
- Brand you like a damn steer!

02:08.868 --> 02:10.529
- Bitch!
- No, please!

02:11.470 --> 02:13.803
Hold the bitch! Hold her!

02:14.041 --> 02:17.373
Hold her or I'll cut her tits off!

02:17.543 --> 02:19.479
Go get Skinny! Quick!

02:21.049 --> 02:22.482
Mike, don't!

02:27.890 --> 02:28.879
Skinny!

02:29.325 --> 02:30.986
Think it's funny?

02:33.229 --> 02:35.221
Skinny, get the gun!

02:45.576 --> 02:47.909
Get off of her, cowboy.

02:54.587 --> 02:57.420
- They wouldn't let you settle it?
- You know Skinny.

02:57.590 --> 02:59.251
He says he'll shoot them.

02:59.425 --> 03:02.863
I says, "You can't."
He says, "Get Little Bill."

03:03.031 --> 03:05.692
I says, "He's sleeping."
But he don't care.

03:05.866 --> 03:08.427
He'll shoot them boys soon.

03:21.952 --> 03:23.385
She dying?

03:23.787 --> 03:25.449
She'll live.

03:27.625 --> 03:30.617
She didn't steal nothing
or touch his poke.

03:30.895 --> 03:33.387
When she seen his
teensy little pecker...

03:33.565 --> 03:36.399
...she giggled.
She didn't know no better.

03:40.073 --> 03:41.802
Hang them, Little Bill.

04:02.999 --> 04:05.662
Go to the office and get the bullwhip.

04:07.171 --> 04:10.436
A whipping's all they
get after what they done?

04:12.776 --> 04:14.938
- It ain't no little thing.
- But what they done--

04:15.113 --> 04:16.512
Alice!

04:16.682 --> 04:18.172
Shut up!

04:21.187 --> 04:23.622
- Whipping won't settle this.
- No?

04:24.191 --> 04:27.683
Here's a contract between me and
Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut whore.

04:30.297 --> 04:33.790
I brought her from Boston,
paid her expenses and all.

04:34.202 --> 04:37.695
I got a contract that represents
an investment of capital.

04:38.140 --> 04:39.300
Property.

04:39.708 --> 04:41.335
Damaged property.

04:42.811 --> 04:45.144
Like if I hamstrung one of their ponies.

04:46.650 --> 04:48.811
You think nobody'll fuck her now?

04:50.720 --> 04:52.052
Hell, no!

04:52.390 --> 04:54.221
Leastways, won't pay to do it!

04:54.658 --> 04:58.890
Nobody's going to pay good money
for a cut-up whore!

05:02.235 --> 05:04.328
You boys are off the Bar T.

05:05.004 --> 05:06.665
Got your own ponies?

05:07.173 --> 05:09.004
Yeah, I got four.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.343
Six.

05:15.082 --> 05:17.847
Guess you want no trial, no fuss?

05:18.420 --> 05:19.853
No, sir.

05:20.689 --> 05:21.746
All right.

05:22.524 --> 05:24.014
You did the cutting.

05:24.426 --> 05:28.022
This fall, you bring in
five ponies to Skinny.

05:28.697 --> 05:29.926
Five?

05:30.200 --> 05:31.531
And you...

05:31.701 --> 05:33.032
...bring two.

05:33.203 --> 05:35.365
- You give them over, hear?
- Yes, sir.

05:36.374 --> 05:37.568
The whip.

05:40.378 --> 05:42.369
Maybe we don't need it now.

05:43.949 --> 05:48.545
I'll tell you, come the spring,
Skinny don't have those ponies....

05:49.722 --> 05:52.953
- ...I'll come looking for you.
- You ain't whipping them?

05:55.061 --> 05:57.222
I fined them instead, Alice.

05:57.464 --> 06:00.128
Skinny gets some ponies and that's it?!

06:01.736 --> 06:03.294
That ain't fair.

06:03.505 --> 06:04.995
That ain't fair!

06:12.414 --> 06:14.748
Haven't you seen enough blood tonight?

06:18.589 --> 06:20.079
Hell, Alice...

06:21.091 --> 06:24.755
...it ain't like they was
tramps or loafers or...

06:24.929 --> 06:26.759
...bad men. They were just...

06:26.930 --> 06:30.095
...hardworking boys that were foolish.

06:30.436 --> 06:34.270
- If they was wicked in a regular way--
- Like whores?

06:36.275 --> 06:38.005
Tend to Delilah.

06:40.514 --> 06:41.777
Go ahead.

07:04.475 --> 07:06.034
I got $85.

07:06.210 --> 07:07.541
I don't know.

07:08.212 --> 07:11.547
If Delilah doesn't care,
what are we so riled up about?

07:11.984 --> 07:15.147
We let them smelly fools
ride us like horses...

07:15.321 --> 07:18.654
...doesn't mean we must let
them brand us like horses.

07:19.325 --> 07:21.726
Maybe we ain't nothing
but whores, but...

07:21.895 --> 07:24.328
...by God, we ain't horses!

07:25.999 --> 07:27.661
I got $112.

07:29.505 --> 07:30.835
That's everything.

07:31.005 --> 07:32.563
And you, Faith?

07:35.945 --> 07:36.934
200.

07:38.914 --> 07:41.349
240... dollars.

07:42.519 --> 07:44.920
Jesus, what you been doing?

07:45.189 --> 07:47.748
Giving Skinny something special?

07:52.530 --> 07:54.192
She laughs.

07:57.603 --> 08:00.767
With what Kate got, and Silky,
me and Little Sue....

08:00.940 --> 08:02.600
It ain't enough.

08:04.944 --> 08:06.605
Not yet, maybe.

08:47.260 --> 08:51.094
You don't look like no son-of-a-
bitching cold-blooded assassin.

08:57.272 --> 08:58.500
Say what?

08:59.106 --> 09:02.270
You call yourself Mr. William Munny.

09:03.945 --> 09:06.937
You have me confused with
someone else, mister.

09:07.449 --> 09:10.511
Shot Charlie Pepper in Lake County?

09:11.288 --> 09:12.778
Hey, Pa!

09:13.023 --> 09:14.514
What, son?

09:14.692 --> 09:16.683
Two more hogs got the fever.

09:17.294 --> 09:18.784
You shot Charlie Pepper.

09:19.196 --> 09:22.360
You killed William Harvey and
robbed that train in Missouri.

09:22.534 --> 09:23.865
Hold on.

09:24.970 --> 09:27.871
Son, get those hogs separated there.

09:28.207 --> 09:29.971
Penny, help your brother.

09:30.210 --> 09:32.473
That one's sick too.

09:36.883 --> 09:38.477
We'll talk inside.

09:46.061 --> 09:49.053
So you're Pete Sothow's nephew?

09:50.332 --> 09:54.737
I thought you'd come to kill me for
something I'd done in the old days.

09:56.840 --> 09:58.172
I could have.

09:58.676 --> 09:59.540
Easy.

10:01.912 --> 10:03.573
I guess maybe so.

10:05.349 --> 10:10.015
You don't look like no meaner-than-hell,
cold-blooded damn killer.

10:11.590 --> 10:13.081
Maybe I ain't.

10:13.259 --> 10:17.697
Uncle Pete says you was the meanest
goddamn son-of-a-bitch alive.

10:17.865 --> 10:20.355
And if I wanted a
partner for a killing...

10:20.867 --> 10:22.700
...you were the worst one.

10:26.275 --> 10:28.105
Meaning the best.

10:28.443 --> 10:31.038
Because you're as cold as snow...

10:31.213 --> 10:34.114
...and don't have no
weak nerve nor fear.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.449
Pete said that?

10:40.056 --> 10:41.388
He did.

10:42.393 --> 10:45.954
I'm a killer myself, but I
haven't killed as many as you...

10:46.130 --> 10:47.893
...because of my youth.

10:48.065 --> 10:50.557
Schofield Kid, they call me.

10:53.639 --> 10:54.628
Why?

10:55.308 --> 10:57.299
You from Schofield?

10:57.911 --> 10:59.639
No, it's on account of my...

11:00.747 --> 11:03.307
...Schofield-Smith & Wesson pistol.

11:08.255 --> 11:09.655
How about it?

11:10.659 --> 11:12.251
How about what?

11:12.661 --> 11:14.926
How about being my partner?

11:15.330 --> 11:18.163
I'm heading north in
through Niobrara to Wyoming.

11:18.433 --> 11:20.995
Kill two no-good cowboys.

11:22.639 --> 11:23.970
For what?

11:24.341 --> 11:26.172
For cutting up a lady.

11:26.844 --> 11:28.175
Her face.

11:28.446 --> 11:31.278
Cut her eyes out, her ears off.

11:31.782 --> 11:34.274
They even cut her teets.

11:37.623 --> 11:39.023
Jesus.

11:39.859 --> 11:42.020
$1,000 reward, Will.

11:43.463 --> 11:44.862
500 each.

11:48.869 --> 11:51.464
I can't move those damn pigs!

11:52.306 --> 11:54.138
Watch your cussing.

11:54.309 --> 11:57.369
Do your best. Go to the
pump and get cleaned up.

11:57.546 --> 11:59.138
Come on.

12:05.822 --> 12:07.984
I ain't like that anymore, Kid.

12:09.560 --> 12:12.893
It was whiskey done it as
much as anything else.

12:13.163 --> 12:15.495
I ain't had a drop in over 10 years.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.491
My wife...

12:18.069 --> 12:19.559
...cured me...

12:20.839 --> 12:22.398
...of drink and...

12:22.675 --> 12:23.903
...wickedness.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.009
You don't look so prosperous.

12:30.249 --> 12:33.083
You could buy her a new
dress with your half.

12:33.353 --> 12:36.016
You could buy your wife a fancy--

12:36.190 --> 12:38.090
She's passed on.

12:42.197 --> 12:44.528
Been gone near three years now.

12:50.708 --> 12:55.611
Don't tell anyone about the reward.
I don't need no one else trying to collect.

12:56.380 --> 12:57.745
Don't see no one.

13:00.217 --> 13:02.208
Change your mind, you could catch me.

13:02.453 --> 13:05.947
I'll ride due west for the
trail headed north into Wyoming.

13:11.631 --> 13:14.066
Let's separate those hogs.

13:44.669 --> 13:45.863
Two others.

13:46.270 --> 13:48.603
I think they got the fever.

14:46.674 --> 14:48.505
Took you boys a while.

14:49.010 --> 14:53.003
A few more days and I was
going to call on the sheriff.

14:53.414 --> 14:54.848
How about that?

14:55.084 --> 14:58.076
The river was all swelled up.
Couldn't cross it.

14:58.353 --> 15:01.187
I bet. Get them horses to the livery.

15:01.357 --> 15:04.020
Take that one over around the back.

15:11.769 --> 15:13.931
Now here's a beauty.

15:14.540 --> 15:17.372
You got my two. This one ain't yours.

15:17.542 --> 15:19.374
We'll see about that.

15:20.613 --> 15:23.447
Bastards! Get out of town!

15:24.051 --> 15:25.608
Get out of here!

15:25.785 --> 15:27.879
You are very sick sons-of-bitches!

15:31.559 --> 15:33.959
Don't come back, butcher!

15:34.229 --> 15:35.719
This here pony...

15:36.397 --> 15:39.299
...I brung for the lady my partner cut.

15:51.248 --> 15:52.739
She's the best.

15:58.256 --> 15:59.815
Better than what I gave him.

16:04.496 --> 16:06.328
She can sell her...

16:06.833 --> 16:08.596
...or do what she wants.

16:12.338 --> 16:13.670
A pony?

16:13.841 --> 16:17.608
She ain't got no face left
and you give her a mangy pony?

16:17.779 --> 16:19.337
She ain't mangy!

16:19.948 --> 16:21.677
Get out of here!

16:23.185 --> 16:25.677
We don't need your goddamn charity!

16:26.122 --> 16:28.784
Get out of our town and don't come back!

16:30.861 --> 16:32.795
Get out of our town!

17:45.446 --> 17:48.109
Did Pa use to kill folks?

18:56.628 --> 18:59.962
I could tell your ma liked
those flowers I gave her.

19:00.233 --> 19:04.397
She ain't a saddle horse no more, Pa.
Ain't used to the feel.

19:05.071 --> 19:07.301
Take care of your sister, son.

19:07.474 --> 19:12.139
Kill a few chickens if you must and
keep those hogs with fever separate.

19:12.413 --> 19:16.748
If you have any problem, go see
Sally Two Trees at Ned Logan's.

19:42.281 --> 19:45.114
Ain't been in the saddle
myself in a while.

19:49.855 --> 19:52.951
She's getting even with me
for the sins of my youth.

19:53.528 --> 19:57.362
In my youth before I met
your dear departed ma...

19:57.698 --> 20:00.964
...I was weak and given
to mistreating animals.

20:06.642 --> 20:09.875
This horse and those hogs over there...

20:14.050 --> 20:17.043
...are getting even for
the cruelty I inflicted.

20:17.321 --> 20:20.655
I used to be able to cuss
and whip a horse like this...

20:20.826 --> 20:23.727
...but your ma showed me
the error of my ways.

20:25.498 --> 20:27.056
I'll be back in 2 weeks.

20:28.167 --> 20:31.898
The spirit of your dear
departed ma watches over you.

20:50.259 --> 20:53.025
- Where'd you get the money?
- We ain't got any!

20:53.264 --> 20:56.255
- You told them cowboys you had!
- We was lying!

20:57.367 --> 20:58.528
Lying?

20:59.270 --> 21:01.760
What if somebody comes to collect?

21:03.608 --> 21:06.544
You going to hump them
a thousand times?

21:09.781 --> 21:13.445
The people come for that thousand
won't tolerate you not having it!

21:17.124 --> 21:19.216
They won't just cut up your face!

21:23.465 --> 21:25.625
You stupid bitches.

21:26.468 --> 21:28.561
Stupid bitches.

21:40.818 --> 21:41.977
Shit!

21:42.252 --> 21:44.243
Damn it! Jesus!

21:46.591 --> 21:47.956
Get your finger?

21:50.496 --> 21:51.929
Hello, Skinny.

21:52.431 --> 21:54.262
You snuck up on me.

21:55.168 --> 21:56.601
Like her?

21:57.504 --> 21:59.938
I heard you done the roof yourself.

22:00.273 --> 22:01.501
Roof?

22:01.675 --> 22:05.010
Jesus, I did practically
the whole damn thing myself.

22:05.280 --> 22:09.113
The Roberts boy carried wood
for me, but that's all.

22:09.350 --> 22:10.943
What's that wood?

22:11.787 --> 22:16.451
I'm building a porch here so I can
sit of an evening and smoke my pipe...

22:16.858 --> 22:20.193
...and drink coffee
and watch the sunset.

22:22.865 --> 22:25.130
Came out here just to
take a look at her?

22:25.369 --> 22:27.132
Them whores...

22:28.038 --> 22:32.475
...been humping all them cowboys been
through town the last two weeks.

22:33.813 --> 22:34.837
Shit.

22:37.316 --> 22:40.308
We got railroad barons
and cattle barons.

22:40.486 --> 22:42.818
You'll be the first billiard baron.

22:43.323 --> 22:47.053
They been humping and telling
every bowlegged one of them...

22:47.560 --> 22:50.554
...they'll pay $1,000 to whoever...

22:50.732 --> 22:53.827
...kills the two boys
that cut up Delilah.

22:56.070 --> 23:00.337
Those cowboys are riding that
beef down to Kansas and Cheyenne?

23:08.352 --> 23:09.751
All week long?

23:10.020 --> 23:12.353
I didn't hear till last night myself.

23:13.257 --> 23:16.420
The word's got all the
way to Texas by now.

23:17.864 --> 23:20.024
Nobody will come clear from Texas.

23:22.602 --> 23:24.365
They got all that money?

23:24.937 --> 23:29.431
Women can lie. Ask where the
money is, they say they got none.

23:30.376 --> 23:32.938
But the five of them could have it.

23:33.615 --> 23:34.774
Maybe.

23:37.719 --> 23:39.050
That much?

23:40.723 --> 23:42.713
You could run off them two cowboys.

23:43.725 --> 23:45.717
I could run off them whores.

23:48.632 --> 23:51.624
They'll just up and
run anyhow, them two.

23:55.473 --> 23:57.907
They'll stay out at the Bar T.

23:58.575 --> 24:00.305
Close to their friends.

24:01.814 --> 24:04.978
Shit, could be nobody won't come at all.

24:07.419 --> 24:09.752
Got to go. I like your house.

24:47.633 --> 24:48.964
It's Will.

24:55.975 --> 24:57.967
Come in out of the sun.

24:59.479 --> 25:00.970
See to Will's horse.

25:06.555 --> 25:08.386
What you doing here?

25:08.891 --> 25:11.154
Just thought I'd drop in on you.

25:12.828 --> 25:15.491
We ain't bad men no more.

25:15.732 --> 25:17.496
We're farmers.

25:17.835 --> 25:22.169
Should be easy killing them, if
they don't go on down to Texas.

25:24.074 --> 25:28.408
How long since you fired a gun
at a man, Will? Ten years?

25:30.516 --> 25:31.744
Eleven.

25:33.586 --> 25:34.916
Easy, huh?

25:35.855 --> 25:39.018
It wasn't all that easy even back then.

25:39.258 --> 25:41.523
And we were young and full of beans.

25:42.429 --> 25:44.420
If you was mad at them...

25:45.033 --> 25:47.763
...over some wrong, I
could see shooting them.

25:48.536 --> 25:51.096
We done stuff for money before.

25:54.877 --> 25:56.435
We thought we did.

25:57.046 --> 25:58.707
What'd these fellows do?

25:59.048 --> 26:03.713
Cheat at cards? Steal some strays?
Spit on a rich fellow? What?

26:04.288 --> 26:05.721
They cut up a woman.

26:08.726 --> 26:13.563
Cut her face, cut her eyes out,
cut her fingers off, cut her tits.

26:15.634 --> 26:17.966
Everything but her cunny, I suppose.

26:19.806 --> 26:21.467
I'll be dogged.

26:25.912 --> 26:27.814
Guess they got it coming.

26:29.317 --> 26:30.908
Of course, Will...

26:32.253 --> 26:35.087
...if Claudia was alive,
you wouldn't do this.

26:45.435 --> 26:48.268
Could you look in on my
youngsters next week?

26:48.505 --> 26:50.939
Got some hogs to separate.

26:53.611 --> 26:55.339
How long will you be gone?

26:58.017 --> 26:59.609
Two weeks, I guess.

27:11.531 --> 27:13.124
What's this Kid like?

27:16.305 --> 27:17.636
Three ways?

27:19.640 --> 27:22.474
I see you still have that Spencer rifle.

27:24.546 --> 27:27.641
And I can still knock the
eye out of a bird flying.

27:37.161 --> 27:38.560
Jesus.

28:35.895 --> 28:37.955
He must be moving right along.

28:38.399 --> 28:41.129
We'll come across him
tomorrow, I reckon.

28:52.748 --> 28:56.742
Got used to my bed.
This ain't going to be like home.

28:58.588 --> 29:01.422
That ain't the only thing I'll miss.

29:06.898 --> 29:08.297
Hell, I'm sorry.

29:08.834 --> 29:11.496
Don't fret it. It ain't nothing.

29:14.773 --> 29:16.435
She don't like it much...

29:16.609 --> 29:18.338
...you riding off with me.

29:19.611 --> 29:21.341
Gave me the evil eye.

29:25.287 --> 29:27.618
You know, Sally's Indian and...

29:28.289 --> 29:30.451
...Indians ain't over-friendly.

29:32.794 --> 29:34.284
I don't blame her.

29:35.630 --> 29:37.621
I won't hold it against her.

29:37.799 --> 29:39.792
She knew me back then.

29:40.304 --> 29:41.794
She knew what a...

29:42.306 --> 29:44.797
...no-good son-of-a-bitch I was.

29:46.543 --> 29:49.206
She ain't allowing that I changed.

29:49.981 --> 29:52.814
She don't realize I
ain't like that no more.

29:52.984 --> 29:55.385
- You know women.
- I ain't the same, Ned.

29:56.822 --> 30:01.657
Claudia straightened me up.
Cleared me of drinking whiskey and all.

30:02.995 --> 30:04.657
Going on this killing...

30:04.831 --> 30:07.732
...don't mean I'll go
back to the way I was.

30:09.403 --> 30:11.166
Just need the money.

30:11.572 --> 30:14.007
Get a new start for them youngsters.

30:19.681 --> 30:22.082
Remember that drover
I shot in the mouth...

30:22.253 --> 30:24.914
...and his teeth came
out the back of his head?

30:28.192 --> 30:30.353
I think about him now and again.

30:33.430 --> 30:36.263
He didn't do anything
to deserve to get shot.

30:37.103 --> 30:39.935
At least nothing I remembered
when I sobered up.

30:45.211 --> 30:47.873
You was one crazy son-of-a-bitch.

30:51.051 --> 30:52.713
No one liked me.

30:52.887 --> 30:56.721
The boys all thought I'd shoot
them out of pure meanness.

30:59.294 --> 31:01.286
You ain't like that no more.

31:02.131 --> 31:04.394
Eagle, he hated my guts.

31:05.969 --> 31:08.631
Bonaparte didn't think too much of me.

31:09.139 --> 31:10.971
Quincy neither, I reckon.

31:13.310 --> 31:16.405
Quincy used to just watch all the time.

31:17.748 --> 31:19.306
Scared.

31:20.419 --> 31:21.977
Like I said...

31:23.422 --> 31:25.414
...you ain't like that no more.

31:26.326 --> 31:27.759
That's right.

31:29.262 --> 31:31.253
I'm just a fellow now.

31:31.431 --> 31:34.333
I ain't no different than anyone else.

31:35.003 --> 31:36.333
No more.

31:50.787 --> 31:53.449
What son-of-a-bitch shot him?

31:53.690 --> 31:56.352
Was it one of them John Bulls?

31:56.693 --> 31:58.025
No, sir.

31:58.196 --> 32:02.632
The would-be assassin is a gentleman
of French ancestry. Or so it seems.

32:02.967 --> 32:05.368
I don't wish to give offense, but...

32:05.638 --> 32:09.802
...the French are known to
be a race of assassins...

32:10.042 --> 32:12.033
...who can't shoot worth a damn.

32:12.212 --> 32:15.704
Any Frenchmen present
are excluded, of course.

32:16.049 --> 32:18.882
Says here a fellow by
the name of Guiteau.

32:21.055 --> 32:24.219
Sure as hell sounds
like a John Bull to me.

32:25.226 --> 32:28.390
Again, I don't wish to give offense...

32:28.563 --> 32:31.727
...when I suggest that
this country select...

32:31.901 --> 32:35.337
...a king or even a queen,
rather than a President.

32:37.174 --> 32:40.166
One isn't that quick to
shoot a king or a queen.

32:40.410 --> 32:43.073
The majesty of royalty, you see.

32:46.084 --> 32:49.076
Maybe you don't wish to
give offense, sir...

32:49.354 --> 32:51.516
...but you are giving it pretty thick.

32:51.857 --> 32:54.690
This country don't need
no queens whatsoever.

32:54.927 --> 32:57.691
- When I heard about queens--
- Shut up, Joe.

32:57.863 --> 33:00.526
What's wrong with you? This dude--

33:00.767 --> 33:03.703
Might be this dude here is English Bob.

33:04.872 --> 33:07.773
Works for the railroad
shooting Chinamen.

33:08.042 --> 33:10.603
Might be waiting for some cowboy...

33:10.779 --> 33:13.770
...to touch his pistol
so he can shoot him.

33:25.563 --> 33:27.394
Is that a fact, mister?

33:28.299 --> 33:30.130
You English Bob?

33:32.738 --> 33:33.797
Pheasants.

33:36.142 --> 33:38.234
Let's shoot some pheasants.

33:38.411 --> 33:39.742
Ten shots.

33:39.979 --> 33:42.743
And let's say $1 a pheasant.

33:43.317 --> 33:46.581
I'll shoot for the Queen, and you for...

33:46.920 --> 33:48.582
...whomever.

34:04.941 --> 34:07.000
That's 8 for me and 1 for you.

34:07.178 --> 34:09.839
That comes to 7 American dollars.

34:10.447 --> 34:12.507
Pretty damn good shooting...

34:13.016 --> 34:14.848
...for a John Bull.

34:15.286 --> 34:18.120
No doubt your aim was
affected by your grief...

34:20.458 --> 34:23.020
...over the injury to your President.

34:35.141 --> 34:39.306
It's the climate that does it.
That, and the infernal distances.

34:39.547 --> 34:40.641
Does what?

34:40.982 --> 34:44.145
Induces people to shoot
persons in high places.

34:46.489 --> 34:48.719
It's a savage country, really.

34:48.891 --> 34:51.985
That's the second one
they shot in 20 years.

34:52.396 --> 34:55.992
It's uncivilized shooting
persons of substance.

35:53.066 --> 35:54.396
Thank you.

35:57.070 --> 35:58.561
Pardon me, gentlemen.

36:00.808 --> 36:03.402
The law obliges you to
surrender all sidearms...

36:03.578 --> 36:06.240
...to the proper authorities
during your visit.

36:07.249 --> 36:08.580
Proper authority?

36:11.754 --> 36:13.245
I can assure you...

36:13.423 --> 36:17.087
...that neither my companion or
I carry firearms on our person.

36:17.494 --> 36:21.431
We rely upon the goodwill of
our fellow man and the...

36:21.666 --> 36:24.100
...forbearance of reptiles.

36:37.750 --> 36:39.650
Unarmed, my ass.

36:40.254 --> 36:42.084
Christ, it's hot.

36:42.356 --> 36:46.589
If I'm going to get shot, I'd
rather it was hot than cold.

36:47.095 --> 36:50.155
Everything hurts me more when it's cold.

36:50.365 --> 36:52.629
- If you hit your thumb--
- Shut up, Fatty!

36:54.102 --> 36:56.094
- I only said--
- Clyde's back.

36:56.606 --> 36:58.369
- With Little Bill?
- No.

36:59.108 --> 37:00.269
Shit.

37:05.616 --> 37:08.449
- You clean my Remington?
- Cleaned and loaded.

37:09.554 --> 37:11.545
Where's Little Bill, for chrissake?

37:12.057 --> 37:13.615
Building his damn porch.

37:14.293 --> 37:15.760
Building his porch?

37:16.295 --> 37:19.697
If you got shot, would you want
it to be a hot or cold day?

37:19.899 --> 37:21.695
I ain't going to get shot.

37:23.570 --> 37:24.798
He's coming?

37:25.572 --> 37:27.564
Of course he's coming.

37:28.310 --> 37:29.799
I just loaded that.

37:29.977 --> 37:33.072
I don't trust nobody to load
my guns for a shooting.

37:34.583 --> 37:35.572
What he say?

37:35.984 --> 37:39.078
Little Bill said he
was building his porch.

37:39.821 --> 37:41.483
You seen that thing?

37:41.658 --> 37:43.320
It was all loaded.

37:43.594 --> 37:46.323
You got three pistols
and you only got one arm!

37:46.929 --> 37:49.956
I don't want to get killed
for lack of shooting back.

37:52.737 --> 37:55.831
He don't have a straight
angle on that whole porch!

37:56.241 --> 37:58.335
Or the whole house, for that matter!

37:58.611 --> 38:00.841
He is the worst damn carpenter.

38:01.448 --> 38:03.176
He didn't say nothing?

38:03.949 --> 38:05.940
Asked what they looked like.

38:07.521 --> 38:10.354
Maybe he's tough but he
sure ain't no carpenter.

38:10.757 --> 38:12.623
Maybe he ain't so tough.

38:13.761 --> 38:15.524
Seem like he was scared?

38:17.366 --> 38:19.458
Little Bill? Him scared?

38:20.703 --> 38:23.968
We never seen him up
against any like these ones.

38:24.206 --> 38:25.196
Killers.

38:26.543 --> 38:29.706
Little Bill come out of
Kansas and Texas, boys.

38:30.381 --> 38:32.474
He worked them tough towns.

38:32.750 --> 38:34.148
Just wondered.

38:36.087 --> 38:38.021
Anybody could be scared.

38:43.061 --> 38:45.053
He wasn't scared, boys.

38:46.232 --> 38:48.063
He just ain't no carpenter.

38:54.242 --> 38:59.077
There's a dignity in royalty which
precludes the likelihood of assassination.

38:59.748 --> 39:02.239
If you pointed a pistol at a queen...

39:02.417 --> 39:05.012
...your hands would shake as if palsied.

39:05.187 --> 39:07.518
I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody.

39:08.925 --> 39:10.916
Always a wise policy.

39:11.762 --> 39:14.322
But if you did, I can assure you...

39:14.598 --> 39:19.093
...the sight of royalty would cause you
to dismiss all thoughts of bloodshed.

39:19.270 --> 39:21.932
You would stand, how should I put it...

39:22.205 --> 39:23.333
...in awe.

39:26.545 --> 39:28.036
Now, a President....

39:28.214 --> 39:31.205
Well, why not shoot the President?

39:37.291 --> 39:38.781
Keep the change.

39:38.959 --> 39:42.794
This Strawberry Alice
person, tell me again.

39:42.964 --> 39:46.798
Down the street to Greely's Beer
Garden and Billiards Parlor.

39:47.068 --> 39:49.559
Say you want a game of billiards.

39:49.738 --> 39:50.727
Billiards?

39:50.872 --> 39:53.138
Even though I don't wish to play?

39:53.310 --> 39:56.746
No matter. They burned the
table in '78 for firewood.

39:57.748 --> 39:58.806
Right.

39:58.982 --> 40:00.142
Quite right.

40:00.651 --> 40:03.381
Mr. Beauchamp, I think a cup of tea--

40:18.504 --> 40:19.766
Hello, Bob.

40:22.410 --> 40:24.901
Boys, this here is English Bob.

40:26.347 --> 40:28.338
Shit and fried eggs.

40:30.853 --> 40:32.411
Been a long time.

40:33.689 --> 40:35.179
Run out of Chinamen?

40:37.293 --> 40:39.785
I thought that you were dead.

40:40.865 --> 40:43.355
You've shaved your chin whiskers off.

40:44.301 --> 40:47.293
I was tasting the soup
two hours after I ate it.

40:48.305 --> 40:50.297
Actually, what I heard was you...

40:50.441 --> 40:53.309
...fell off your horse.
Drunk, of course.

40:53.545 --> 40:56.208
And that you broke your bloody neck.

40:57.650 --> 40:59.709
I heard that one myself, Bob.

40:59.952 --> 41:01.943
Hell, I even thought I was dead.

41:02.154 --> 41:04.817
Till I found out I was just in Nebraska.

41:06.394 --> 41:07.519
Who's he?

41:08.229 --> 41:09.560
W.W. Beauchamp.

41:10.732 --> 41:13.395
This is Little Bill Daggett.

41:14.236 --> 41:16.328
And friends, of course.

41:17.338 --> 41:19.899
From Newton, Hays? From Abilene?

41:20.844 --> 41:22.175
In person.

41:23.680 --> 41:26.080
You work for the railroads too?

41:28.085 --> 41:29.245
I write.

41:30.254 --> 41:31.345
Letters?

41:31.755 --> 41:33.587
Books, Bill. Books.

41:34.592 --> 41:35.753
Actually...

41:36.261 --> 41:38.253
...he's my biographer.

41:44.437 --> 41:46.928
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

41:54.715 --> 41:56.274
It's only a book.

41:56.785 --> 41:57.877
A book?

42:04.292 --> 42:05.818
That means you boys can read.

42:06.797 --> 42:09.129
That means you saw the signs...

42:09.299 --> 42:12.462
...saying surrender your firearms.

42:14.738 --> 42:16.730
But like you told young Andy...

42:18.543 --> 42:20.239
...you're not armed, are you?

42:21.814 --> 42:23.475
Not really, Bill.

42:24.751 --> 42:28.481
Got a Peacemaker, but that
wouldn't worry you, would it?

42:28.754 --> 42:32.316
If you don't see it.
Or better, if you don't hear it.

42:33.493 --> 42:35.257
I'm afraid so, Bob.

42:35.997 --> 42:37.931
I don't like firearms around.

42:59.957 --> 43:01.857
Be very careful with it, sonny.

43:08.200 --> 43:11.101
See what kind of books
Mr. Beauchamp is packing.

43:15.708 --> 43:17.701
Make sure you don't get wet.

43:24.619 --> 43:25.984
No shit.

43:26.120 --> 43:29.113
All he's got is writing
stuff and this book.

43:32.228 --> 43:33.820
"The Duck of Death?"

43:34.064 --> 43:35.122
Duke.

43:37.234 --> 43:38.633
"The Duke."

43:41.839 --> 43:43.739
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

43:44.008 --> 43:45.909
I'll have that.32, Bob.

43:59.358 --> 44:00.758
Now, Little Bill.

44:01.763 --> 44:04.754
You will leave me at
the mercy of my enemies.

44:09.772 --> 44:11.034
Enemies?

44:14.442 --> 44:17.038
You been talking about the Queen again?

44:18.181 --> 44:19.876
On Independence Day?

44:32.631 --> 44:34.463
I guess you think I'm kicking you.

44:36.068 --> 44:37.626
But it ain't so!

44:37.970 --> 44:39.905
What I'm doing is talking!

44:40.106 --> 44:41.095
Hear?!

44:41.641 --> 44:44.075
Talking to all them villains in Kansas!

44:44.210 --> 44:46.805
To all those villains in Missouri!

44:54.489 --> 44:55.820
And those villains...

44:57.159 --> 44:59.094
...down in Cheyenne!

45:04.835 --> 45:07.429
I'm saying there ain't no whore's gold!

45:13.011 --> 45:16.105
Even if there was, they
don't want to come for it...

45:17.216 --> 45:18.478
...anyhow!

45:47.650 --> 45:49.208
What are you looking at?!

45:49.385 --> 45:50.683
Go on!

45:58.062 --> 46:00.055
Mind your own business!

46:28.832 --> 46:30.322
Ever go into town?

46:31.601 --> 46:32.932
On occasion.

46:33.203 --> 46:35.604
To sell a hog, pick up supplies.

46:36.840 --> 46:39.105
I mean, get yourself a woman.

46:42.614 --> 46:44.844
No, I never go into town for that.

46:45.350 --> 46:46.840
A man like me?

46:48.121 --> 46:51.454
Only woman I could get is
one I'd have to pay for.

46:52.458 --> 46:54.722
That ain't right, buying flesh.

46:56.062 --> 46:59.227
Claudia, rest her soul,
wouldn't want me doing that.

46:59.467 --> 47:01.229
Me being a father, and all.

47:06.474 --> 47:07.964
You just use your hand?

47:14.084 --> 47:16.313
I don't miss it all that much.

47:37.177 --> 47:39.509
Goddamn, somebody's shooting at us!

47:41.015 --> 47:42.346
You hit?

47:44.685 --> 47:47.280
I bumped my head falling off my horse.

47:52.527 --> 47:54.427
Ain't shooting at us no more.

47:56.866 --> 47:58.527
Shooting way over yonder.

48:00.871 --> 48:03.032
What the hell's he shooting at?

48:03.540 --> 48:05.371
Beats the hell out of me.

48:08.445 --> 48:10.711
Reckon we in somebody's field?

48:10.883 --> 48:12.873
I didn't see nothing planted.

48:13.819 --> 48:15.343
Shooting at us again.

48:19.826 --> 48:22.316
He's shooting at the whole horizon.

48:23.463 --> 48:25.227
Wait! You'll mark us!

48:25.400 --> 48:26.731
Hey, Kid!

48:28.970 --> 48:30.733
That's the Kid shooting at us?

48:30.972 --> 48:32.735
Kid, it's me! Will Munny!

48:32.908 --> 48:35.342
What the hell's he shooting at us for?

48:35.477 --> 48:36.738
That you?

48:39.482 --> 48:40.915
Yeah, it's me!

48:41.351 --> 48:44.582
Don't go shooting at us
no more! You hear me?

48:45.255 --> 48:47.588
Who the hell you got with you, Will?

48:48.592 --> 48:50.992
It's Ned Logan, my old partner!

48:51.262 --> 48:53.753
Don't go shooting at us, you hear?

48:54.499 --> 48:57.435
We'll get our horses
and come on over there.

48:57.703 --> 48:59.864
You ain't going to shoot, are you?

49:02.108 --> 49:03.439
I ain't!

49:16.125 --> 49:18.388
Chased that horse a damn mile.

49:18.526 --> 49:22.122
- What was you shooting at us for?
- I thought you was following me.

49:22.398 --> 49:25.026
We was. You said if I changed my mind--

49:25.234 --> 49:27.897
Wasn't nothing said about no partner.

49:28.538 --> 49:30.404
This here's Ned Logan.

49:30.741 --> 49:33.903
He's the Schofield Kid,
nephew to Pete Sothow.

49:34.044 --> 49:38.142
I seen two fellows following me.
My guess is you come to kill me.

49:39.651 --> 49:41.812
We never talked about no other fellow.

49:42.654 --> 49:46.751
There's two cowboys. Better there's
three of us, if they got friends.

49:46.926 --> 49:50.828
I can take care of them two myself.
It don't take three.

49:51.564 --> 49:55.832
Ned's an awful good shot with a rifle.
Hit a bird in the eye flying.

49:56.438 --> 49:58.337
Better than you, anyhow.

49:58.839 --> 50:01.775
- You wasn't even coming close.
- Hands off!

50:12.356 --> 50:16.190
Thought I'd check it for you.
Maybe something's bent.

50:16.360 --> 50:17.793
It ain't... bent.

50:18.863 --> 50:20.853
You were shooting all over creation!

50:21.031 --> 50:22.590
You'll share your half with him?

50:23.202 --> 50:25.033
I figure three ways.

50:26.205 --> 50:27.467
Wrong.

50:29.208 --> 50:31.540
Sorry I wasted your time, Ned.

50:34.047 --> 50:35.878
You going back with him?

50:36.883 --> 50:38.545
He's my partner.

50:39.053 --> 50:40.884
He don't go, I don't.

50:45.560 --> 50:47.825
What's it come to, three ways?

51:41.791 --> 51:43.053
Shit!

51:44.629 --> 51:46.790
What are you pissing on about?

51:48.799 --> 51:51.064
What are you looking at?

51:51.303 --> 51:52.565
Looking at?

51:52.804 --> 51:54.067
Clouds.

51:54.407 --> 51:58.308
He's looking at them clouds on
account of we got a storm coming.

52:01.414 --> 52:02.904
I seen them.

52:13.428 --> 52:15.919
You was smart to change your mind.

52:19.102 --> 52:21.433
I'm a real good shot with this rifle.

52:24.007 --> 52:25.599
See that hawk?

52:28.946 --> 52:30.674
I could hit it with one shot.

52:34.620 --> 52:38.613
Hell, I could hit it too.
If I didn't mind wasting a shot.

52:41.360 --> 52:43.124
There ain't no hawk, Kid.

52:44.130 --> 52:46.120
You can't see for shit, can you?

52:49.370 --> 52:51.133
See your canteen?

52:57.546 --> 52:59.138
How far can you see?

52:59.281 --> 53:00.270
Far enough.

53:00.482 --> 53:03.646
- We ain't going to shoot canteens!
- How far? 100 yards?

53:03.786 --> 53:04.878
More.

53:05.556 --> 53:08.389
- See that scrub oak tree yonder?
- Fuck you.

53:08.659 --> 53:11.560
- He's blind, Will!
- I ain't blind, you asshole!

53:11.995 --> 53:13.485
Hold it!

53:14.298 --> 53:16.893
How far can you see, Kid? 50 yards?

53:17.302 --> 53:20.238
You bet your ass I can
see 50 yards, Will.

53:20.573 --> 53:24.009
I can see well enough to
shoot this son-of-a-bitch.

53:24.243 --> 53:25.574
Hold on.

53:26.011 --> 53:27.501
Hear that, Ned?

53:27.747 --> 53:30.239
Kid can see 50 yards. Fine.

53:31.585 --> 53:32.917
Jesus.

53:35.923 --> 53:39.189
Fifty yards'll do just fine.
Now let's move out.

53:48.606 --> 53:51.267
They look like real hard cases, Bob.

53:52.842 --> 53:54.606
Did you kill all 7 of them?

53:54.779 --> 53:56.770
Or just wing some of them?

54:02.721 --> 54:05.350
That you here embalmed on the cover?

54:08.127 --> 54:09.788
"The Duck of Death?"

54:10.563 --> 54:11.860
The Duke.

54:12.465 --> 54:14.296
"The Duke of Death."

54:18.139 --> 54:22.075
You always were good with a
pistol, but 7 of them? Boy!

54:22.243 --> 54:25.235
Protecting that woman.
How the hell do you do that?

54:29.585 --> 54:33.647
It's desirable in the publishing
business to take a certain...

54:33.890 --> 54:36.587
...Iiberty when depicting
the cover scene.

54:36.761 --> 54:38.887
For reasons involving the marketplace.

54:39.095 --> 54:43.658
From what I read, the writing's not
that much different than the picture.

54:45.903 --> 54:48.395
I can assure you, Mr. Daggett...

54:48.774 --> 54:52.404
...that the events described are
taken from eyewitness accounts.

54:52.679 --> 54:54.612
- Eyewitnesses?
- Yes, sir.

54:55.280 --> 54:57.272
Like the Duck himself, I guess.

54:59.519 --> 55:00.783
The Duke.

55:01.122 --> 55:02.520
Duck, I says.

55:11.032 --> 55:15.130
"'You have insulted the honor of
this beautiful woman, Corcoran'...

55:15.305 --> 55:16.636
...said the Duck.

55:18.040 --> 55:20.032
'You must apologize.'

55:20.310 --> 55:22.870
But Two-Gun Corcoran
would none of it.

55:23.046 --> 55:26.538
Cursing, he reached for his
pistols and would have killed him...

55:26.717 --> 55:31.383
...but the Duck was faster and hot
lead blazed from his smoking six-guns."

55:32.825 --> 55:35.726
I consider that an accurate
depiction of events.

55:35.895 --> 55:40.333
There is a certain poetry to the
language which I couldn't resist.

55:43.470 --> 55:46.736
I was in the Blue Bottle
Saloon in Wichita...

55:46.974 --> 55:50.068
...the night English Bob
killed Corky Corcoran.

55:50.678 --> 55:52.475
I didn't see you there...

55:53.248 --> 55:54.840
...nor no woman...

55:54.983 --> 55:57.178
...nor two-gun shooters.

55:57.419 --> 55:58.910
Nor none of this.

55:59.188 --> 56:01.247
- You were there?
- Yeah, I was there.

56:04.495 --> 56:05.928
First off...

56:06.496 --> 56:10.194
...Corky never carried two
guns, though he should have.

56:10.601 --> 56:12.593
He was called Two-Gun Corcoran.

56:12.771 --> 56:14.762
A lot of folks did call him Two-Gun.

56:15.106 --> 56:17.268
But not because he had two pistols.

56:17.510 --> 56:19.944
He had a dick that was so big...

56:20.212 --> 56:23.113
...it was longer than the
barrel on his Walker Colt.

56:23.950 --> 56:26.943
The only insulting he did
was stick that thing...

56:27.220 --> 56:30.451
...into a French lady
English Bob was sweet on.

56:30.958 --> 56:34.019
The night Corky walked
into the Blue Bottle...

56:34.796 --> 56:38.028
...before he knows what's what,
Bob takes a shot at him!

56:38.232 --> 56:40.029
And misses, he's so damn drunk.

56:40.234 --> 56:44.400
That bullet whizzing by panicked
Corky, and he did the wrong thing.

56:45.141 --> 56:47.632
In his hurry, he shot his damn toe off.

56:48.545 --> 56:50.480
Meantime, Bob here...

56:51.148 --> 56:53.912
...aims real good and
squeezes off another...

56:54.051 --> 56:56.485
...but he misses, he's still so drunk!

56:56.654 --> 56:59.488
He hits this thousand-dollar
mirror over the bar.

56:59.658 --> 57:02.422
The Duck of Death is as good as dead...

57:03.161 --> 57:05.255
...because Corky does it right.

57:05.665 --> 57:07.565
He aims real careful.

57:07.834 --> 57:09.324
No hurry....

57:12.272 --> 57:14.673
The Walker Colt blew up in his hand...

57:14.843 --> 57:17.334
...a failing common to that model.

57:18.346 --> 57:22.339
If Corky'd had two guns
instead of just a big dick...

57:23.685 --> 57:26.349
...he'd have defended
himself to the end.

57:26.856 --> 57:28.289
Wait a minute.

57:29.860 --> 57:33.091
English Bob killed him when
he didn't even have....

57:33.363 --> 57:36.799
Bob wasn't going to wait for
Corky to grow a new hand.

57:37.467 --> 57:40.301
No, he just walked over
there real slow...

57:41.540 --> 57:42.972
...'cause he's drunk...

57:45.377 --> 57:47.368
...and shot him through the liver.

58:07.664 --> 58:10.429
I don't like rocks on my dad-gum back.

58:11.269 --> 58:14.602
- I sure do miss my bed.
- You said that last night.

58:14.771 --> 58:19.606
Last night I said I missed my wife.
Tonight I just miss my dad-gum bed!

58:20.844 --> 58:24.006
You'll miss your dad-gum
roof next, I suppose.

58:38.360 --> 58:39.691
Will?

58:42.031 --> 58:44.295
That business up in Jackson County...

58:44.533 --> 58:45.864
...that really happen?

58:46.368 --> 58:48.198
The way they say it happened?

58:48.970 --> 58:50.130
What business?

58:52.807 --> 58:56.641
Two deputies up close pointing
their rifles right at you.

58:56.811 --> 58:58.642
Got you dead to rights.

58:59.047 --> 59:01.880
You pulled out your pistol
and blew them to hell.

59:02.483 --> 59:04.382
Only took a scratch yourself.

59:11.058 --> 59:15.893
Uncle Pete never seen nothing like you
shooting your way out of that scrape.

59:21.000 --> 59:22.831
Well, I don't recollect.

59:26.173 --> 59:28.003
You don't recollect?

59:28.841 --> 59:30.001
Right.

59:31.911 --> 59:33.003
Ned...

59:35.347 --> 59:37.838
...how many men you killed?

59:42.688 --> 59:44.518
Ain't you going to answer?

59:45.023 --> 59:46.854
What the hell's that to you?

59:49.694 --> 59:54.529
I got to know what kind of fellow I'm
riding with, case we get into a scrape.

59:58.036 --> 01:00:00.094
How many men you killed, Kid?

01:00:00.638 --> 01:00:01.627
Five.

01:00:01.906 --> 01:00:02.895
How many?

01:00:05.709 --> 01:00:06.698
Five.

01:00:07.778 --> 01:00:09.769
I done killed 5 of them.

01:00:11.448 --> 01:00:14.884
That's including a Mexican
who come at me with a knife.

01:00:15.218 --> 01:00:17.778
Why don't you shut up? Get some rest.

01:00:18.955 --> 01:00:22.119
You boys're as crotchety
as a couple of old hens.

01:00:25.061 --> 01:00:26.221
Actually...

01:00:26.462 --> 01:00:30.125
...Mr. Corcoran was faster
on the draw than the Duck--

01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:32.230
Than English Bob?

01:00:32.401 --> 01:00:33.390
Faster?

01:00:33.568 --> 01:00:35.297
Faster was his mistake.

01:00:35.470 --> 01:00:38.963
If he hadn't rushed, he wouldn't
have shot himself in the toe.

01:00:39.142 --> 01:00:40.904
He would've killed old Bob.

01:00:44.579 --> 01:00:47.479
Being a good shot and being
quick with a pistol...

01:00:47.815 --> 01:00:52.150
...don't do no harm, but it don't
mean much next to being cool-headed.

01:00:52.921 --> 01:00:56.651
A man who'll keep his head,
not get rattled under fire...

01:00:57.158 --> 01:00:58.819
...Iike as not will kill you.

01:00:58.993 --> 01:01:01.257
But if the other fellow is quicker--

01:01:01.429 --> 01:01:03.919
Then he'll hurry and he'll miss.

01:01:04.164 --> 01:01:05.324
Look.

01:01:08.169 --> 01:01:12.935
That's as fast as I can draw, aim and
hit anything more than 10 feet away.

01:01:13.673 --> 01:01:15.334
'Less it's a barn.

01:01:15.942 --> 01:01:17.933
But if he doesn't miss?

01:01:19.778 --> 01:01:20.939
He'll kill you.

01:01:25.118 --> 01:01:28.609
That's why there's so few
dangerous men around like Bob.

01:01:29.822 --> 01:01:30.811
Like me.

01:01:32.024 --> 01:01:35.619
It ain't so easy to shoot a
man if he's shooting back.

01:01:35.861 --> 01:01:37.852
That'll flat rattle some folks.

01:01:39.798 --> 01:01:41.959
- I'll show you something.
- Wait.

01:01:42.201 --> 01:01:43.190
Look.

01:01:43.801 --> 01:01:44.859
Take that.

01:01:48.039 --> 01:01:49.370
Take it.

01:01:53.878 --> 01:01:55.368
There's the key.

01:01:56.547 --> 01:01:57.878
Just shoot me...

01:01:58.983 --> 01:02:02.474
...and you and Bob can ride
on out of here free as birds.

01:02:08.892 --> 01:02:12.328
- Is it loaded?
- Wouldn't do any good if it wasn't.

01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:14.223
You got to cock it.

01:02:21.338 --> 01:02:22.669
Cock it.

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:32.046
Point it.

01:02:36.352 --> 01:02:37.842
Go on. Point it.

01:02:47.195 --> 01:02:49.925
Now all you must do
is pull the trigger.

01:03:05.212 --> 01:03:06.702
Hot, ain't it?

01:03:08.449 --> 01:03:10.610
Your finger wasn't even on the trigger.

01:03:11.951 --> 01:03:13.282
What if....

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:16.210
What if I gave it to him?

01:03:17.791 --> 01:03:19.122
Do it.

01:03:27.633 --> 01:03:28.792
You don't--

01:03:28.967 --> 01:03:30.059
Do it.

01:04:31.694 --> 01:04:34.025
I guess he don't want it, Mr. Beauchamp.

01:04:55.983 --> 01:04:58.041
You were right not to take it.

01:04:58.318 --> 01:04:59.808
I'd have killed you.

01:05:18.738 --> 01:05:21.001
We could use some rain.

01:05:31.684 --> 01:05:34.414
You no-good goddamn
pig-fucking whore!

01:05:35.854 --> 01:05:37.514
Sorry, horse.

01:05:48.866 --> 01:05:51.926
I brung this for when
we kill them fellows.

01:05:52.203 --> 01:05:54.193
Figured we could use some now.

01:05:54.438 --> 01:05:57.032
Not me. I don't touch it no more.

01:05:57.274 --> 01:05:58.708
It's raining.

01:05:59.043 --> 01:06:01.943
I know it's raining!
Give some to the Kid.

01:06:05.282 --> 01:06:08.046
You think that Kid really killed 5 men?

01:06:14.891 --> 01:06:19.725
When you talked about the time them
deputies had the drop on you and Pete....

01:06:23.232 --> 01:06:26.291
I remember there was
3 men you shot, not 2.

01:06:26.901 --> 01:06:29.234
I ain't like that no more, Ned!

01:06:29.472 --> 01:06:31.963
I ain't no crazy killing fool.

01:06:34.476 --> 01:06:37.570
Still think it'll be easy
to kill them cowboys?

01:06:38.747 --> 01:06:40.976
If we don't drown first.

01:06:49.923 --> 01:06:52.323
Give these keys to the conductor.

01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:56.751
He can loose Bob's cuffs as soon
as he's outside the county.

01:06:58.098 --> 01:06:59.759
Got my pistols?

01:07:02.102 --> 01:07:04.263
I guess you know, Bob, that...

01:07:04.505 --> 01:07:07.996
...if I see you again I'll
just shoot in self-defense.

01:07:14.547 --> 01:07:16.742
I didn't steal your biographer!

01:07:18.851 --> 01:07:21.182
He's staying on his own account!

01:07:21.687 --> 01:07:24.520
He can go stuff himself
as well, can't he?!

01:07:24.856 --> 01:07:27.951
A plague on the whole
stinking lot of you!

01:07:28.194 --> 01:07:30.354
Without morals or laws!

01:07:31.029 --> 01:07:34.465
And all you whores!
You got no laws and no honor!

01:07:34.866 --> 01:07:38.301
It's no wonder you all
emigrated to America!

01:07:38.803 --> 01:07:41.295
They wouldn't have you in England!

01:07:42.808 --> 01:07:44.708
You're a lot of savages!

01:07:44.876 --> 01:07:48.208
You're all a bunch of bloody
savages! A curse on you!

01:07:50.548 --> 01:07:52.379
Nobody's going to come...

01:07:53.650 --> 01:07:56.484
...after what Little Bill
done to that Englishman.

01:07:58.489 --> 01:08:01.150
Delilah, can't you
get them tables clean?

01:08:01.891 --> 01:08:06.157
Cover your face, somebody might hump
you and you wouldn't have to clean.

01:08:07.831 --> 01:08:10.162
What do they call that face cover?

01:08:10.333 --> 01:08:11.493
A veil.

01:08:11.668 --> 01:08:13.397
Yeah. Get a veil!

01:08:22.845 --> 01:08:24.403
Rain's coming.

01:08:25.247 --> 01:08:26.680
Thank God.

01:08:52.205 --> 01:08:53.365
Sure?

01:09:05.384 --> 01:09:07.283
You all right, Will?

01:09:17.796 --> 01:09:19.287
Fellow asking for Alice.

01:09:19.799 --> 01:09:21.890
Tonight? You ain't joshing?

01:09:22.901 --> 01:09:24.460
This way, mister.

01:09:24.904 --> 01:09:27.737
Must be randy as hell to
come out in this shit.

01:09:37.981 --> 01:09:40.814
"No, no! You're wrong,
Little Bill!" he said.

01:09:40.984 --> 01:09:44.250
"That's not the Curly J.
That's a Bobbed J!"

01:09:44.823 --> 01:09:47.756
He had changed it over.
And I said to him...

01:09:47.991 --> 01:09:51.085
..."Jim, you're a liar
and a horse thief!"

01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:55.591
He saw nobody would help him none.

01:09:55.766 --> 01:09:59.668
He went to start crying and
sobbing and just carrying on.

01:09:59.937 --> 01:10:03.269
He said, "God, please,
don't kill me, Bill!

01:10:03.506 --> 01:10:04.837
Please don't kill me!"

01:10:05.007 --> 01:10:06.941
I said, "It makes me sick--"

01:10:08.178 --> 01:10:09.667
Open the window.

01:10:10.279 --> 01:10:13.680
"--to see a man carrying two
pistols and a Henry rifle...

01:10:14.784 --> 01:10:16.513
...and crying like a damn baby."

01:10:16.686 --> 01:10:18.448
So... you killed him?

01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:19.678
No.

01:10:20.121 --> 01:10:21.679
But I should have.

01:10:22.692 --> 01:10:24.626
I can't abide them kind.

01:10:24.861 --> 01:10:26.953
You see them in the taverns.

01:10:27.195 --> 01:10:29.527
Tramps and drunk teamsters.

01:10:29.865 --> 01:10:31.856
Crazed miners.

01:10:32.534 --> 01:10:36.025
Sporting their pistols and
acting like they was bad men.

01:10:36.370 --> 01:10:40.307
But without any sand or character.
Not even any bad character.

01:10:43.978 --> 01:10:46.310
I do not like assassins.

01:10:47.715 --> 01:10:49.978
Or men of low character.

01:10:51.886 --> 01:10:53.319
Like English Bob.

01:10:53.888 --> 01:10:55.879
But Bob was no coward, you know.

01:10:56.323 --> 01:10:59.382
He wouldn't cry and carry on like that--

01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:01.849
Sheriff....

01:11:03.162 --> 01:11:05.891
I don't have any more receptacles.

01:11:06.165 --> 01:11:08.224
Maybe you should just
hang the carpenter.

01:11:14.072 --> 01:11:17.166
I meant that because of
the--if you hang....

01:11:19.411 --> 01:11:20.674
Never mind.

01:11:22.848 --> 01:11:24.577
What the hell?

01:11:25.183 --> 01:11:27.083
On a night like this!

01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:29.918
Who is it?

01:11:30.087 --> 01:11:32.248
Deputy Charley Hecker, Bill.

01:11:36.028 --> 01:11:40.521
Three fellows just come into town, Bill.
They're down to Greely's.

01:11:40.698 --> 01:11:42.689
There's two of them got guns.

01:11:50.942 --> 01:11:53.206
What the hell's keeping that Kid?

01:11:55.045 --> 01:11:56.603
You suppose he's up--

01:12:00.216 --> 01:12:01.706
You look like shit.

01:12:06.222 --> 01:12:08.713
You remember Eagle Hendershot?

01:12:13.729 --> 01:12:15.060
I saw him.

01:12:16.732 --> 01:12:18.221
Will, he's dead.

01:12:19.067 --> 01:12:20.797
No, I saw him, Ned.

01:12:21.737 --> 01:12:25.070
His head was broke open.
You could see inside of it.

01:12:26.975 --> 01:12:27.964
Jesus.

01:12:28.242 --> 01:12:29.732
You got a fever.

01:12:30.144 --> 01:12:33.079
- Take your drink.
- Worms were coming out.

01:12:37.919 --> 01:12:39.750
I'll go find the Kid.

01:12:39.988 --> 01:12:43.479
Must be he's getting an advance
on one of the sporting ladies.

01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:48.252
If I was to....

01:12:50.097 --> 01:12:52.497
If it worked out that I could...

01:12:52.766 --> 01:12:55.758
...take a little time
for myself, would you--

01:13:01.774 --> 01:13:03.675
I guess you don't want to come.

01:14:26.421 --> 01:14:28.183
Give me the pistol.

01:14:34.429 --> 01:14:36.419
I says give me over your pistol.

01:14:40.101 --> 01:14:41.534
I ain't drunk.

01:14:43.703 --> 01:14:47.435
Ordinance says you got to turn
in your firearms to my office...

01:14:48.209 --> 01:14:49.540
...day or night.

01:14:56.382 --> 01:14:59.714
I guess you didn't see the sign,
because of the weather.

01:15:01.721 --> 01:15:02.881
No.

01:15:04.224 --> 01:15:06.885
But I ain't armed.

01:15:08.894 --> 01:15:11.624
Your friends upstairs got any pistols?

01:15:17.402 --> 01:15:18.960
They ain't armed either.

01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:22.729
Spilled your whiskey.

01:15:24.742 --> 01:15:26.141
What's your name?

01:15:28.079 --> 01:15:29.411
William...

01:15:32.150 --> 01:15:33.310
...Hendershot.

01:15:36.988 --> 01:15:39.478
Well, Mr. William Hendershot...

01:15:41.491 --> 01:15:44.928
...what if I was to say
you was a no-good liar?

01:15:48.098 --> 01:15:52.432
And if I was to say you shit in your
pants because of a cowardly soul...

01:15:53.503 --> 01:15:56.994
...I bet you'd show me that pistol
right quick and shoot me dead.

01:15:57.173 --> 01:15:58.435
Is that so?

01:16:05.514 --> 01:16:07.277
Maybe, I guess.

01:16:09.351 --> 01:16:10.682
But the fact...

01:16:11.286 --> 01:16:12.617
...is I ain't...

01:16:12.787 --> 01:16:14.517
...carrying no firearm.

01:16:14.857 --> 01:16:16.017
Get up.

01:16:49.156 --> 01:16:51.487
What's this for, snakes and such?

01:16:53.826 --> 01:16:56.727
We don't have any snakes
in here, Mr. Hendershot.

01:17:02.001 --> 01:17:03.491
It ain't loaded.

01:17:05.338 --> 01:17:06.327
Powder's wet.

01:17:09.574 --> 01:17:11.235
You see, Mr. Beauchamp?

01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:16.238
Such is the trash I spoke of!

01:17:24.388 --> 01:17:26.015
They're in all the saloons...

01:17:26.190 --> 01:17:28.421
...in all your prosperous communities!

01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:29.858
Wichita!

01:17:32.830 --> 01:17:34.821
Over in Cheyenne!

01:17:38.435 --> 01:17:39.594
Abilene!

01:17:43.207 --> 01:17:45.698
But not in the town of Big Whiskey.

01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:51.869
Hurry!

01:17:52.048 --> 01:17:53.709
Know what to tell Little Bill?

01:17:53.883 --> 01:17:56.283
Look sharp for that lone pine.

01:17:56.552 --> 01:17:57.951
Don't miss it.

01:17:58.121 --> 01:18:00.055
Not the shirt! Put his boots on!

01:18:10.065 --> 01:18:12.625
What are we going to do about Will?

01:18:12.901 --> 01:18:16.234
Come on! Let's hope them
horses are still there!

01:18:50.603 --> 01:18:52.661
Let the man out, W.W.

01:18:53.605 --> 01:18:57.770
He's desiring to leave the
hospitality of Big Whiskey behind him.

01:19:30.641 --> 01:19:34.041
Easy. She's got to be able
to turn a dollar a time!

01:19:34.311 --> 01:19:36.973
How come they lit out the back window?

01:19:37.214 --> 01:19:39.808
They seen you beating on their friend.

01:19:40.650 --> 01:19:42.709
They just come for
the billiards, honest.

01:19:42.886 --> 01:19:43.875
Billiards?!

01:19:45.889 --> 01:19:48.220
They just passing through here?

01:19:48.491 --> 01:19:50.015
Going to Fort Buford.

01:19:50.192 --> 01:19:53.162
You kicked the shit
out of an innocent man.

01:19:53.730 --> 01:19:54.890
Innocent?

01:19:55.232 --> 01:19:56.721
Innocent of what?

01:20:25.927 --> 01:20:27.690
You done this before?

01:20:29.096 --> 01:20:30.688
Plenty of times.

01:20:32.433 --> 01:20:34.367
His pistol must've jammed.

01:20:36.770 --> 01:20:38.931
Bring that candle in closer.

01:20:39.106 --> 01:20:40.368
I can't see.

01:20:52.051 --> 01:20:54.884
He wouldn't take no beating
if it hadn't jammed.

01:20:56.222 --> 01:20:58.782
He wouldn't give it over and not shoot.

01:21:02.961 --> 01:21:04.724
He don't look so good.

01:21:06.799 --> 01:21:08.732
He didn't even pull his pistol?

01:21:08.900 --> 01:21:10.800
He ain't as tough as you, Kid.

01:21:10.969 --> 01:21:12.800
I'd have pulled my pistol.

01:21:12.971 --> 01:21:14.131
You did!

01:21:14.306 --> 01:21:16.239
Out of the lady and out the window!

01:21:16.407 --> 01:21:19.240
- That was your idea! I wanted to--
- We must go.

01:21:19.477 --> 01:21:22.811
Already? Darling, I'm
ready for another advance.

01:21:22.981 --> 01:21:26.472
- You'll use it all up.
- No more advances on what you ain't done.

01:21:26.650 --> 01:21:30.916
Sweetheart, we're just waiting
on this weather to clear!

01:21:31.489 --> 01:21:33.149
We'll need more food!

01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:35.251
3 days' worth.

01:21:35.593 --> 01:21:37.254
3 days?

01:21:38.095 --> 01:21:41.427
- We'll kill them tomorrow.
- I don't kill nobody without him.

01:21:41.598 --> 01:21:44.260
We don't need him! We can do it.

01:21:46.002 --> 01:21:48.765
He ain't nothing but a
broken-down pig farmer.

01:21:49.338 --> 01:21:52.831
One of us'll bring food and
some whiskey in the morning!

01:21:53.009 --> 01:21:55.170
And some medicine if you got any!

01:21:56.678 --> 01:21:59.010
Don't it make you sick hearing him?

01:21:59.281 --> 01:22:01.010
Don't you ladies worry!

01:22:02.184 --> 01:22:05.620
Me and Ned will kill them two
sons-of-bitches for you!

01:22:12.527 --> 01:22:14.017
Claudia.

01:22:22.703 --> 01:22:24.193
She's not here.

01:22:24.372 --> 01:22:25.964
Is that you, Ned?

01:22:27.708 --> 01:22:29.140
I've seen him.

01:22:32.212 --> 01:22:34.477
I saw the Angel of Death.

01:22:35.049 --> 01:22:37.642
I've seen the river, Ned.

01:22:38.218 --> 01:22:40.049
He's got snake eyes.

01:22:40.220 --> 01:22:42.381
Who's got snake eyes?

01:22:43.156 --> 01:22:45.214
It's the Angel of Death.

01:22:48.562 --> 01:22:51.224
Ned, I'm scared of dying.

01:22:51.898 --> 01:22:53.558
Easy, partner.

01:22:54.233 --> 01:22:56.224
I seen Claudia too.

01:22:57.002 --> 01:23:00.335
That's good you saw Claudia, ain't it?

01:23:00.672 --> 01:23:03.335
Her face was all covered with worms.

01:23:04.009 --> 01:23:05.670
Ned, I'm scared.

01:23:07.079 --> 01:23:08.568
I'm dying.

01:23:13.418 --> 01:23:15.579
No, don't tell nobody.

01:23:16.020 --> 01:23:17.920
Don't tell my kids...

01:23:18.356 --> 01:23:21.086
...none of the things I did. Hear me?

01:23:23.027 --> 01:23:24.358
All right.

01:23:41.711 --> 01:23:43.611
He's gonna die, ain't he?

01:23:44.947 --> 01:23:46.039
Maybe.

01:23:46.949 --> 01:23:48.940
Suppose he does?

01:23:52.722 --> 01:23:54.280
We'll bury him.

01:23:54.624 --> 01:23:56.615
That ain't what I mean.

01:23:59.961 --> 01:24:02.795
You mean will I help
you kill them cowboys?

01:24:04.799 --> 01:24:06.892
I can't spot them myself.

01:24:07.135 --> 01:24:08.727
But you could.

01:24:09.404 --> 01:24:13.134
You could spot that big
bastard a half-mile off.

01:24:14.808 --> 01:24:16.470
And if I spot him?

01:24:17.812 --> 01:24:20.144
Then I ride up close and shoot him.

01:24:23.250 --> 01:24:24.649
Just like that?

01:24:24.985 --> 01:24:27.647
I'm a damn killer. I done it before.

01:24:30.657 --> 01:24:32.922
I'm more of a killer than he is.

01:25:02.621 --> 01:25:04.521
I thought you was an angel.

01:25:06.525 --> 01:25:08.186
You ain't dead.

01:25:16.468 --> 01:25:18.128
Some big fellow...

01:25:19.203 --> 01:25:21.364
...kicked the hell out of me.

01:25:24.141 --> 01:25:26.472
I must look like you now.

01:25:28.478 --> 01:25:30.811
You don't look nothing like me.

01:25:32.650 --> 01:25:34.378
No offense meant.

01:25:36.986 --> 01:25:39.546
It was you those cowboys cut up.

01:25:46.563 --> 01:25:49.224
My partners, Ned and that Kid...

01:25:49.665 --> 01:25:50.723
...they around?

01:25:52.167 --> 01:25:55.330
They went out scouting
when your fever broke.

01:25:56.238 --> 01:25:57.397
Scouting?

01:25:58.239 --> 01:26:00.231
Out to the Bar T...

01:26:00.509 --> 01:26:02.500
...Iooking for them.

01:26:06.514 --> 01:26:08.414
How long I been here?

01:26:09.517 --> 01:26:11.007
Three days.

01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:14.249
Are you hungry or....

01:26:14.856 --> 01:26:16.756
Three days?

01:26:16.924 --> 01:26:18.516
I should be.

01:26:30.771 --> 01:26:32.602
I thought I was gone.

01:26:35.609 --> 01:26:39.942
I wouldn't normally pay no notice
to high country like this.

01:26:40.613 --> 01:26:43.208
Trees. But I'm sure noticing now.

01:26:44.217 --> 01:26:46.377
Thought I was dying for sure.

01:26:48.554 --> 01:26:50.283
I brought your hat.

01:26:50.456 --> 01:26:52.890
You left it down at Greely's.

01:26:53.792 --> 01:26:54.952
Thanks.

01:26:56.895 --> 01:26:58.295
That sheriff...

01:26:59.565 --> 01:27:01.055
...still looking for me?

01:27:01.233 --> 01:27:02.563
Little Bill?

01:27:02.734 --> 01:27:05.396
No, he thinks you went south.

01:27:08.573 --> 01:27:11.302
Are you really going
to kill them cowboys?

01:27:12.577 --> 01:27:13.908
I guess.

01:27:14.746 --> 01:27:16.907
Still a payment coming, isn't there?

01:27:18.749 --> 01:27:21.149
The other two, your friends...

01:27:21.985 --> 01:27:24.977
...they're taking
advances on the payment.

01:27:25.922 --> 01:27:27.413
Advances?

01:27:29.326 --> 01:27:30.918
Free ones.

01:27:33.330 --> 01:27:36.264
Alice and Silky been
giving them free ones.

01:27:38.100 --> 01:27:39.431
I see.

01:27:43.105 --> 01:27:45.266
Would you like a free one?

01:27:55.183 --> 01:27:56.617
I guess not.

01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:00.852
I didn't mean with me. I meant...

01:28:01.456 --> 01:28:04.357
...Alice and Silky would
give you a free one...

01:28:04.526 --> 01:28:06.186
...if you wanted.

01:28:06.527 --> 01:28:08.620
That's all I meant.

01:28:12.634 --> 01:28:16.626
I didn't mean I didn't want a
free one because you been cut up.

01:28:17.638 --> 01:28:21.369
What I said about you
looking like me ain't true.

01:28:21.975 --> 01:28:23.966
You ain't ugly like me.

01:28:25.212 --> 01:28:28.045
It's just that we both have scars.

01:28:30.984 --> 01:28:34.545
You're a beautiful woman and
if I wanted a free one...

01:28:34.821 --> 01:28:38.312
...I'd want it with you
more than the other two.

01:28:40.727 --> 01:28:42.160
It's just that...

01:28:42.829 --> 01:28:45.229
...I can't on account of my wife.

01:28:52.004 --> 01:28:53.164
Your wife?

01:29:02.246 --> 01:29:04.077
I admire you for that...

01:29:04.749 --> 01:29:06.341
...being true to your wife.

01:29:08.185 --> 01:29:10.244
I've known a lot of men...

01:29:12.590 --> 01:29:14.023
...who weren't.

01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:17.918
I suppose.

01:29:24.368 --> 01:29:26.198
Is she back in Kansas?

01:29:30.273 --> 01:29:32.935
She's watching over my young ones.

01:29:38.047 --> 01:29:39.276
Hang on!

01:29:39.449 --> 01:29:41.440
Get the damn iron!

01:30:04.639 --> 01:30:07.129
Jesus, boys, my leg's broke!

01:30:08.977 --> 01:30:10.968
I'm pinned, boys!

01:30:11.980 --> 01:30:13.641
Better finish him.

01:30:14.147 --> 01:30:16.479
He ain't dead? You didn't get him?

01:30:16.650 --> 01:30:18.311
He got the boy's horse.

01:30:19.152 --> 01:30:21.586
Finish him before he gets clear.

01:30:24.324 --> 01:30:26.258
Get behind them rocks.

01:30:26.660 --> 01:30:28.321
Get over there!

01:30:31.497 --> 01:30:34.330
What happened?
He ain't killed?!

01:30:34.767 --> 01:30:35.825
What's going on?

01:30:36.102 --> 01:30:38.662
He gets in those rocks,
we won't get him.

01:30:38.938 --> 01:30:41.498
- Unless we go down there.
- What rocks?

01:30:41.774 --> 01:30:44.675
Why don't you shoot?
What's going on?

01:30:49.447 --> 01:30:50.675
Shoot!

01:31:04.194 --> 01:31:06.459
I ain't very good with one of these.

01:31:12.202 --> 01:31:14.693
Keep going, Davey! The rocks!

01:31:16.874 --> 01:31:18.034
Get him?

01:31:18.975 --> 01:31:20.306
Where is he?

01:31:20.543 --> 01:31:22.808
How many more shots do I have?

01:31:24.715 --> 01:31:27.649
How many more shots do I have?

01:31:31.054 --> 01:31:32.146
Two.

01:31:43.999 --> 01:31:45.398
Did you get him?

01:32:02.750 --> 01:32:04.742
Here, reload this.

01:32:05.854 --> 01:32:08.253
- You missed him.
- I got him.

01:32:12.193 --> 01:32:13.592
He ain't killed.

01:32:14.195 --> 01:32:16.025
Maybe, maybe not.

01:32:16.596 --> 01:32:18.757
Got him through the gut, I think.

01:32:23.203 --> 01:32:24.932
Think he'll die?

01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:28.571
We killed him?

01:32:39.284 --> 01:32:40.615
We killed him...

01:32:40.953 --> 01:32:42.284
...I guess.

01:32:46.225 --> 01:32:48.215
I'm dying, boys!

01:32:48.794 --> 01:32:52.457
Then you shouldn't have cut
up no woman, you asshole!

01:32:58.136 --> 01:33:00.400
Jesus, I'm so thirsty.

01:33:04.809 --> 01:33:06.902
Give me some water, please!

01:33:07.245 --> 01:33:08.576
Please, Slim!

01:33:09.747 --> 01:33:11.475
I'm bleeding, Slim!

01:33:15.652 --> 01:33:18.417
Give him a drink of water, goddamn it!

01:33:22.492 --> 01:33:26.588
Give him some water, for chrissake!
We ain't going to shoot!

01:33:28.597 --> 01:33:29.996
You won't?

01:33:34.004 --> 01:33:35.766
Hold on, Davey-boy!

01:33:36.939 --> 01:33:38.497
Here I come now!

01:33:44.946 --> 01:33:46.937
Don't shoot, you bastards!

01:33:50.519 --> 01:33:51.849
Shit!

01:34:01.696 --> 01:34:03.186
They take him water?

01:34:06.034 --> 01:34:08.365
Jesus, Johnny! They shot him!

01:34:08.535 --> 01:34:10.196
Hold on now!

01:34:18.879 --> 01:34:22.474
You murdering bastards!
You killed our Davey-boy!

01:34:31.324 --> 01:34:33.224
When do we double back?

01:34:33.893 --> 01:34:35.724
After a ways.

01:34:36.996 --> 01:34:38.224
Not me.

01:34:39.065 --> 01:34:41.328
I'm heading back down to Kansas.

01:34:41.499 --> 01:34:43.660
We must kill the other one first.

01:34:44.569 --> 01:34:48.903
With any luck, we'll find him
by nightfall or in the morning.

01:34:49.074 --> 01:34:51.736
We'll shoot him and head
back with the money.

01:34:53.912 --> 01:34:55.503
Want the Spencer?

01:34:55.679 --> 01:34:57.510
It's no time to quit.

01:34:57.681 --> 01:34:59.842
- You'll lose your share.
- Shut up!

01:35:00.084 --> 01:35:02.849
I'll see you, Will. So long, Kid.

01:35:12.195 --> 01:35:14.858
I ain't no good with that damn thing.

01:35:15.366 --> 01:35:20.200
Me and the Kid'll go over to that ranch
and when we find him we'll shoot him.

01:35:20.536 --> 01:35:24.267
We'll meet up with you, get our
money, and head south together.

01:35:25.041 --> 01:35:27.440
Suppose he don't go back to the ranch?

01:35:27.876 --> 01:35:31.870
He ain't going into town.
He won't stay out in the open country.

01:35:32.048 --> 01:35:34.380
He'll hole up at that ranch.

01:35:36.051 --> 01:35:37.609
I ain't waiting.

01:35:38.053 --> 01:35:40.715
I'll look in on your young ones.

01:35:47.396 --> 01:35:50.297
Forget what the Kid said
about the money and all.

01:35:50.465 --> 01:35:51.795
I'll bring yours.

01:35:55.970 --> 01:35:57.631
Kid's full of shit.

01:36:25.798 --> 01:36:28.063
Doing some repairs up here.

01:36:28.301 --> 01:36:30.235
They killed one of them cowboys.

01:36:34.239 --> 01:36:35.570
Shit.

01:36:36.976 --> 01:36:41.469
Parsons said he saw three men,
right after sun-up, headed east.

01:36:41.980 --> 01:36:46.315
One was on a dun and another
was on a flea-bitten grey.

01:36:46.986 --> 01:36:50.978
He didn't know what the third
one was on, maybe an Appaloosa.

01:36:51.489 --> 01:36:55.653
Amos says to ask if the county will
pay for feed for all the horses.

01:36:55.826 --> 01:36:59.263
Witherspoon won't sell us no more
.30-30 shells without we pay.

01:36:59.430 --> 01:37:00.920
Use my dogs.

01:37:01.099 --> 01:37:03.499
Then the county must
take responsibility.

01:37:04.267 --> 01:37:08.761
Fatty, get on out there to the Bar
T and make sure that other cowboy...

01:37:09.006 --> 01:37:11.668
...stays put and don't expose himself.

01:37:21.617 --> 01:37:24.017
I didn't think they'd really do it.

01:37:24.453 --> 01:37:27.446
Think they come clear
from Kansas to fuck us?

01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:33.952
But that Kid's just a
boy and the other one...

01:37:34.463 --> 01:37:37.454
...Will, the nice one, being
so true to his wife....

01:37:37.699 --> 01:37:40.190
Wife? He ain't got no wife.

01:37:40.635 --> 01:37:43.628
- Yes, he does. He said--
- He ain't got no wife.

01:37:43.972 --> 01:37:45.963
Not above ground, anyways.

01:37:51.979 --> 01:37:53.469
Murdering whores!

01:37:54.548 --> 01:37:56.141
He had it coming...

01:37:56.384 --> 01:37:58.045
...for what he done.

01:37:58.319 --> 01:37:59.718
And the other one too!

01:37:59.888 --> 01:38:02.219
Both of them for what they done!

01:38:12.332 --> 01:38:13.822
We got one!

01:38:16.169 --> 01:38:18.899
We got one, Sheriff! Out by Cow Creek!

01:38:19.072 --> 01:38:20.403
Is he alive?

01:38:20.573 --> 01:38:24.064
Yeah! Bunch of us from
Bar T went out looking...

01:38:24.242 --> 01:38:26.507
...'cause they killed one of our own.

01:38:26.746 --> 01:38:30.011
Come across the bastard
on a roan heading south.

01:38:30.249 --> 01:38:31.580
He admit it?

01:38:31.851 --> 01:38:36.014
No. But I guess he will soon enough.
Had a Spencer rifle on him.

01:38:36.688 --> 01:38:38.246
They messing him up?

01:38:39.759 --> 01:38:41.350
Little bit.

01:38:44.930 --> 01:38:49.025
Get out there. Find out what
happened to those other two!

01:39:11.889 --> 01:39:14.220
See anything out there, Buck?

01:39:14.557 --> 01:39:18.391
Hell, yes! Seen about 200
fellows packing rifles.

01:39:18.728 --> 01:39:22.288
Got the place surrounded.
Say they want Quick Mike's ass.

01:39:23.065 --> 01:39:26.467
I said, "How much?" They says,
"Five. " I said, "Dollars?"

01:39:26.636 --> 01:39:27.967
They said, "Cents."

01:39:28.138 --> 01:39:29.729
I said, "Sold."

01:39:31.306 --> 01:39:33.069
Well, I ain't worried!

01:39:33.308 --> 01:39:35.640
'Cause I got me some protection.

01:40:01.334 --> 01:40:03.325
- Tell you where them others is?
- Nope.

01:40:03.503 --> 01:40:04.663
Names?

01:40:04.938 --> 01:40:07.669
Only told us his name, Ned Roundtree.

01:40:10.177 --> 01:40:11.508
Bring him in.

01:40:14.447 --> 01:40:17.347
You'll want to tell me
and Mr. Beauchamp here...

01:40:18.017 --> 01:40:20.349
...all about your two
villainous friends.

01:40:20.953 --> 01:40:25.117
I'll want the names and whereabouts
of those murderous son-of-a-bitches.

01:40:39.872 --> 01:40:41.634
Sure is ripe.

01:40:43.208 --> 01:40:45.142
Going to get a lot riper.

01:40:46.477 --> 01:40:48.138
Think he's still in there?

01:40:49.646 --> 01:40:50.977
He's in there.

01:40:52.150 --> 01:40:55.313
He's holding on to his
shit like it was money.

01:40:56.154 --> 01:40:57.643
He's in there.

01:40:58.055 --> 01:41:00.319
Tell me right off if you see him.

01:41:02.659 --> 01:41:04.819
You won't shoot him your own self?

01:41:05.228 --> 01:41:06.821
You can shoot him.

01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:49.533
You, Mr. Quincy and...
what was the young fellow's name?

01:41:54.041 --> 01:41:55.531
Elroy Tate.

01:42:00.447 --> 01:42:02.937
No, that's not what you said.

01:42:03.283 --> 01:42:04.443
It is.

01:42:04.718 --> 01:42:06.379
No, you said...

01:42:06.887 --> 01:42:09.719
..."Elroy Quincy out
of Medicine Hat and...

01:42:11.391 --> 01:42:13.382
...Henry Tate out of Cheyenne."

01:42:14.627 --> 01:42:16.117
Hell if I did.

01:42:17.062 --> 01:42:18.552
Hell if I did.

01:42:20.733 --> 01:42:24.066
Go get them whores that
fucked these boys that night.

01:42:24.237 --> 01:42:26.397
Strawberry Alice and Silky?

01:42:26.638 --> 01:42:28.401
Go on and get them!

01:42:37.482 --> 01:42:40.747
Them whores will tell
different lies than you.

01:42:42.820 --> 01:42:45.914
And when their lies ain't
the same as your lies....

01:42:48.326 --> 01:42:50.317
I ain't going to hurt no woman.

01:42:51.595 --> 01:42:53.495
But I will hurt you.

01:42:56.100 --> 01:42:58.090
Not gentle like before...

01:42:59.669 --> 01:43:01.261
...but bad.

01:43:17.987 --> 01:43:19.147
Where you going?

01:43:19.356 --> 01:43:21.949
- The shithouse.
- Let me finish this hand.

01:43:22.124 --> 01:43:24.183
To protect me while I take a dump?

01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:26.624
- You'll get bushwhacked.
- I'll fart on them.

01:43:26.862 --> 01:43:29.955
- I'll go with him.
- You can wipe my ass, Thirsty.

01:43:30.198 --> 01:43:33.532
Hell with him. He ain't
polite, he should get shot.

01:43:37.538 --> 01:43:38.630
That him?

01:43:39.140 --> 01:43:40.698
Yeah, it's him.

01:43:44.545 --> 01:43:46.978
Go get him. He's all yours.

01:44:23.916 --> 01:44:25.076
Assassins!

01:44:28.887 --> 01:44:29.751
Shoot!

01:44:46.037 --> 01:44:47.698
Come on, goddamn it!

01:45:04.788 --> 01:45:06.118
Get him?

01:45:19.068 --> 01:45:20.057
Cover me.

01:45:22.637 --> 01:45:24.730
- I can't see them!
- Just shoot!

01:45:35.083 --> 01:45:36.573
Get him!

01:46:02.108 --> 01:46:04.508
Was it like that in the old days?

01:46:05.345 --> 01:46:07.506
Everybody riding out, shooting...

01:46:08.348 --> 01:46:12.283
...smoke all over, folks yelling,
bullets whizzing by?

01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:15.519
I guess so.

01:46:19.525 --> 01:46:22.119
Shit, I thought they'd get us.

01:46:23.195 --> 01:46:25.288
I was even scared a little.

01:46:25.531 --> 01:46:26.861
For a minute.

01:46:29.535 --> 01:46:31.628
You ever scared in them days?

01:46:33.805 --> 01:46:35.294
I can't remember.

01:46:36.541 --> 01:46:38.805
I was drunk most of the time.

01:46:45.550 --> 01:46:48.144
I shot that fucker three times!

01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:52.654
He went for his pistol
and I blazed away.

01:46:53.557 --> 01:46:54.888
First shot...

01:46:56.826 --> 01:46:58.555
...I got him right in the chest.

01:47:08.237 --> 01:47:09.727
That was the first.

01:47:11.240 --> 01:47:12.572
First what?

01:47:15.010 --> 01:47:16.910
First one I ever killed.

01:47:20.849 --> 01:47:23.339
I know I said I shot five men.

01:47:24.686 --> 01:47:26.347
It weren't true.

01:47:28.691 --> 01:47:30.920
That Mexican who had a knife...

01:47:32.093 --> 01:47:34.186
...I busted his leg with a shovel.

01:47:34.429 --> 01:47:36.420
I didn't kill him or nothing.

01:47:39.866 --> 01:47:42.859
You killed the hell out
of that fellow today.

01:47:45.106 --> 01:47:46.436
Hell, yeah!

01:47:50.043 --> 01:47:52.204
I killed the hell out of him!

01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:55.942
Three shots while he took a shit....

01:48:02.888 --> 01:48:04.287
Take a drink.

01:48:29.414 --> 01:48:31.075
It don't seem real.

01:48:32.917 --> 01:48:35.578
How he won't never breathe again, ever.

01:48:36.987 --> 01:48:38.420
How he's dead.

01:48:40.158 --> 01:48:41.750
And the other one too.

01:48:44.595 --> 01:48:46.825
On account of pulling a trigger.

01:48:49.767 --> 01:48:52.098
It's a hell of a thing, killing a man.

01:48:54.270 --> 01:48:56.171
You take away all he's got...

01:48:57.274 --> 01:48:59.264
...and all he'll ever have.

01:49:04.947 --> 01:49:06.777
I guess they had it coming.

01:49:12.955 --> 01:49:14.945
We all have it coming, Kid.

01:49:29.805 --> 01:49:32.796
I was watching you.
You weren't followed.

01:49:34.141 --> 01:49:38.134
Silky and Faith rode off to the east
and two deputies followed them.

01:49:45.052 --> 01:49:47.144
Want to help me count this?

01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:50.653
- I trust you.
- Don't go trusting me too much.

01:49:52.158 --> 01:49:55.491
In fact, we'll give
Ned his share together.

01:49:55.662 --> 01:49:58.153
You'll know I ain't holding out on you.

01:49:58.498 --> 01:49:59.897
Ned's share?

01:50:02.901 --> 01:50:05.062
He went south. We'll catch up.

01:50:05.671 --> 01:50:07.332
He's dead.

01:50:10.843 --> 01:50:12.401
What do you mean?

01:50:13.679 --> 01:50:16.409
He went south yesterday. He ain't dead.

01:50:17.015 --> 01:50:19.676
They killed him. I thought you knew.

01:50:19.851 --> 01:50:21.842
Nobody killed Ned!

01:50:22.019 --> 01:50:24.580
He didn't kill anyone, he went south!

01:50:24.757 --> 01:50:26.850
Why would anybody kill Ned?

01:50:29.627 --> 01:50:30.889
Who killed him?

01:50:31.596 --> 01:50:32.927
Little Bill.

01:50:33.197 --> 01:50:35.756
The boys caught him. Little Bill...

01:50:36.733 --> 01:50:38.065
...beat him up.

01:50:38.236 --> 01:50:42.900
He was making him answer questions and
beating him up, then Ned just died.

01:50:43.540 --> 01:50:46.270
They got a sign on him
says he was a killer.

01:50:46.443 --> 01:50:47.774
A sign?

01:50:48.445 --> 01:50:50.106
In front of Greely's.

01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:52.544
A sign on him in front of Greely's!

01:50:57.053 --> 01:50:59.452
These questions he was asking...

01:51:00.623 --> 01:51:01.954
...what were they?

01:51:06.596 --> 01:51:08.995
About where you and him was.

01:51:09.298 --> 01:51:10.629
Then what?

01:51:11.634 --> 01:51:16.070
A cowboy come in saying you killed
Quick Mike in the shithouse at the Bar T.

01:51:17.071 --> 01:51:20.063
So Little Bill killed
him for what we done?

01:51:20.308 --> 01:51:21.970
Not on purpose.

01:51:22.411 --> 01:51:24.469
But he started hurting him worse.

01:51:24.646 --> 01:51:26.477
Making him tell stuff.

01:51:26.748 --> 01:51:28.238
First, Ned wouldn't talk.

01:51:29.083 --> 01:51:32.916
Then Little Bill hurt him so
bad, he said who you was.

01:51:34.922 --> 01:51:38.415
He said how you was really
William Munny out of Missouri...

01:51:39.159 --> 01:51:41.992
Little Bill said, "The
same William Munny...

01:51:42.262 --> 01:51:45.754
...who dynamited the railroad in '69,
killing women and children?"

01:51:45.999 --> 01:51:48.592
Ned said you done a lot worse and was...

01:51:49.168 --> 01:51:51.603
...more cold-blooded
than William Bonney.

01:51:51.772 --> 01:51:55.105
Said if he hurt Ned again,
you'd come kill him...

01:51:55.274 --> 01:51:58.107
...Iike you killed the
U.S. Marshal in '70.

01:52:03.115 --> 01:52:05.345
That didn't scare him, did it?

01:52:07.286 --> 01:52:08.617
No, sir.

01:52:16.528 --> 01:52:18.189
Give me your Schofield.

01:52:18.697 --> 01:52:19.959
Why?

01:52:20.131 --> 01:52:21.120
Give it.

01:52:28.539 --> 01:52:30.029
You keep it.

01:52:30.641 --> 01:52:32.040
I won't use it.

01:52:34.546 --> 01:52:36.638
I won't kill nobody no more.

01:52:40.217 --> 01:52:41.878
I ain't like you, Will.

01:52:45.889 --> 01:52:47.880
You better ride on back, Miss.

01:52:52.562 --> 01:52:54.996
Keep all of it. It's yours.

01:52:55.999 --> 01:52:59.332
What about spectacles
and fancy clothes?

01:53:00.168 --> 01:53:02.898
I'd rather be blind
and ragged than dead.

01:53:04.340 --> 01:53:06.240
You don't have to worry, Kid.

01:53:06.409 --> 01:53:08.239
I ain't going to kill you.

01:53:08.844 --> 01:53:11.005
You're the only friend I got.

01:53:18.854 --> 01:53:21.322
Take this money and give my share...

01:53:21.590 --> 01:53:23.421
...and Ned's share to my kids.

01:53:23.925 --> 01:53:27.588
Tell them if I ain't back in a week,
to give half to Sally Two Trees.

01:53:27.762 --> 01:53:30.526
You keep the rest. Get them spectacles.

01:53:30.731 --> 01:53:32.562
You'll go kill Little Bill?

01:53:32.934 --> 01:53:35.266
Stay clear of folks you see.

01:53:35.436 --> 01:53:37.097
A lot will want to hang you.

01:53:37.438 --> 01:53:38.769
Get going.

01:54:23.053 --> 01:54:27.046
I'll say this just one more
time, so don't ask me again!

01:54:27.558 --> 01:54:31.962
Those on the posse today got one
drink coming from the county budget!

01:54:34.132 --> 01:54:37.396
And those who rode
yesterday get another drink.

01:54:39.070 --> 01:54:40.230
Hold it!

01:54:40.739 --> 01:54:42.138
That's two!

01:54:42.407 --> 01:54:45.307
After that, it comes
out of your own pocket!

01:54:45.577 --> 01:54:48.240
We'll pull out early in the morning.

01:54:48.481 --> 01:54:52.814
We'll chase them clear to Texas,
so don't spend too much money.

01:54:53.820 --> 01:54:56.414
We'll divide up into four parties!

01:54:56.656 --> 01:54:59.147
We'll hit all the farms and trails...

01:54:59.325 --> 01:55:00.815
...in a big circle.

01:55:01.094 --> 01:55:02.994
We're bound to find somebody...

01:55:03.163 --> 01:55:05.324
...who seen these skunks.

01:55:22.684 --> 01:55:24.948
Who owns this shithole?

01:55:34.463 --> 01:55:35.862
Fat man.

01:55:36.298 --> 01:55:37.629
Speak up.

01:55:40.203 --> 01:55:42.193
I own this establishment.

01:55:45.642 --> 01:55:48.975
I bought it from Greely
for a thousand dollars.

01:55:50.647 --> 01:55:52.205
Clear out of there.

01:55:55.152 --> 01:55:56.641
Hold it!

01:56:07.398 --> 01:56:10.163
Sir, you are a cowardly son-of-a-bitch!

01:56:11.670 --> 01:56:13.398
You just shot an unarmed man.

01:56:14.006 --> 01:56:18.842
He should've armed himself if he's going
to decorate his saloon with my friend.

01:56:19.679 --> 01:56:22.238
You'd be William Munny
out of Missouri...

01:56:22.748 --> 01:56:24.682
...killer of women and children.

01:56:25.250 --> 01:56:26.582
That's right.

01:56:28.589 --> 01:56:30.419
I've killed women and children.

01:56:32.091 --> 01:56:35.687
I killed just about everything
that walks or crawls.

01:56:37.196 --> 01:56:39.596
And I'm here to kill you, Little Bill.

01:56:40.701 --> 01:56:42.532
For what you did to Ned.

01:56:47.207 --> 01:56:49.039
You boys better move away.

01:56:59.388 --> 01:57:00.787
Gentlemen...

01:57:01.389 --> 01:57:03.619
...he's got one barrel left.

01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:06.892
When he fires that, use your pistols...

01:57:07.063 --> 01:57:10.054
...and shoot him down like
the mangy scoundrel he is!

01:57:24.414 --> 01:57:26.975
Misfire! Kill the son-of-a-bitch!

01:58:03.456 --> 01:58:07.620
Any man don't want to get killed,
better clear on out the back.

01:58:52.176 --> 01:58:54.075
I'm shot! I've been shot!

01:58:54.410 --> 01:58:55.901
You ain't shot.

01:59:01.919 --> 01:59:04.683
I don't have a gun. I am not armed.

01:59:06.423 --> 01:59:07.857
Pick up that rifle.

01:59:09.928 --> 01:59:11.088
Pick it up.

01:59:13.364 --> 01:59:14.525
Shells too.

01:59:27.713 --> 01:59:29.203
You killed Little Bill.

01:59:30.684 --> 01:59:32.242
You ain't armed?

01:59:34.620 --> 01:59:36.611
I'm not. I don't have a gun.

01:59:36.789 --> 01:59:39.555
I've never had a gun. I'm a writer!

01:59:40.962 --> 01:59:42.223
A writer?

01:59:43.230 --> 01:59:45.461
- Letters and such?
- Books.

01:59:46.067 --> 01:59:47.227
Books.

01:59:47.802 --> 01:59:51.794
I don't believe it, you killed
five men. Single-handed.

02:00:00.315 --> 02:00:02.579
That's a Spencer rifle, right?

02:00:11.427 --> 02:00:12.917
Who'd you kill first?

02:00:16.766 --> 02:00:19.098
"When confronted by superior numbers...

02:00:19.269 --> 02:00:22.500
...an experienced gunfighter will
fire on the best shot first."

02:00:23.507 --> 02:00:26.499
Little Bill said that.
You probably killed him first.

02:00:28.012 --> 02:00:30.104
I was lucky in the order.

02:00:31.014 --> 02:00:33.950
I'm always lucky when it
comes to killing folks.

02:00:37.622 --> 02:00:39.783
Who was next? Clyde, right?

02:00:39.958 --> 02:00:42.688
You killed Clyde, or
was it Deputy Andy--

02:00:42.961 --> 02:00:45.521
All I can tell you is who'll be last.

02:01:22.070 --> 02:01:24.061
I don't deserve this...

02:01:26.174 --> 02:01:27.835
...to die like this.

02:01:30.845 --> 02:01:32.677
I was building a house.

02:01:33.582 --> 02:01:36.244
"Deserve's" got nothing to do with it.

02:01:38.921 --> 02:01:41.254
I'll see you in hell, William Munny.

02:02:21.634 --> 02:02:23.897
All right, I'm coming out!

02:02:24.236 --> 02:02:26.967
Any man I see out there, I'll kill him!

02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:30.074
Anyone takes a shot at me...

02:02:30.976 --> 02:02:33.740
...I'll not only kill
him, but his wife...

02:02:33.913 --> 02:02:35.745
...and all his friends...

02:02:36.150 --> 02:02:38.481
...and burn his damn house down!

02:02:45.592 --> 02:02:47.491
Nobody better shoot!

02:03:02.943 --> 02:03:05.106
Charley, go ahead. Shoot him!

02:03:20.964 --> 02:03:23.023
Hell, no! I ain't no deputy!

02:03:43.654 --> 02:03:46.054
You better bury Ned right!

02:03:46.891 --> 02:03:50.225
You better not cut up nor
otherwise harm no whores!

02:03:54.500 --> 02:03:57.992
Or I'll come back and kill every
one of you sons-of-bitches.
