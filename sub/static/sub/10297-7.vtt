Good, good.

11:00.467 --> 11:01.667
My head burned too.

11:01.667 --> 11:02.667
Yeah, good.

11:02.667 --> 11:06.000
Just stay there
one second, Steve.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.901

Al, Al!

11:09.868 --> 11:11.400

11:11.400 --> 11:14.334
Where there's pain,
there's life.

You should know that
better than anyone.

are alive.

11:29.133 --> 11:30.534
Al, you're not
supposed to drink it,

11:30.534 --> 11:31.400

11:35.033 --> 11:37.567

"bottoms up" for?

11:37.567 --> 11:40.067
Don't worry!

11:40.067 --> 11:41.100
Ah...

11:41.100 --> 11:42.133
Don't worry.

something here.

Can you still see me?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.367
Yeah.

part mine, Steve.

gonna do with yours?

grow mine wild

at 'em anyway?

as barren as your lawn.

12:58.767 --> 13:01.267

13:01.267 --> 13:03.100
Well, Bud,
hair's hereditary.

13:03.100 --> 13:04.868
So is hair-loss.

13:04.868 --> 13:06.434

13:06.434 --> 13:07.834
by the time
his skin clears up,

13:07.834 --> 13:09.834
his hair will be
falling out?

Oh, Bud, my poor sexless,

I am so happy for you.

What did you have me for,
a biological experiment?

13:23.534 --> 13:25.968
I mean, I was just getting
used to being poor,

13:25.968 --> 13:27.534
and now this.

13:27.534 --> 13:28.634
Now, easy, Bud.

You can always make money
selling flowers at airports.

I'll lend you one of my dresses.

Dad, what am I gonna do?

13:57.901 --> 14:00.334
I mean, am I gonna lose
just a little like you,

14:00.334 --> 14:02.634

Mr. Rhoades?

14:06.267 --> 14:09.300
Bud, sit down.

14:09.300 --> 14:11.267
I hope that when
you become a man,

14:11.267 --> 14:12.834
hair won't be
important...

14:12.834 --> 14:14.434
that a man
won't be judged

14:14.434 --> 14:16.167
by what he looks like
on the outside,

14:16.167 --> 14:18.734
but who he is
on the inside.

gonna happen,

make you breakfast.

to Daddy's head.

He's not growing
any hair, is he?

14:44.634 --> 14:49.400
No, but a few hundred

14:49.400 --> 14:51.133
You know, it's amazing.

14:51.133 --> 14:53.734

when he was young.

14:53.734 --> 14:56.634
He stood upright. He had hair.

14:56.634 --> 14:58.901

15:00.100 --> 15:02.667
You can't, honey.

15:06.801 --> 15:08.534
did you throw out
those hairs I had

Sometimes,
you come up craps.

to talk to you.

we have much to talk about.

my face on Dad's bowling ball

15:27.901 --> 15:30.601

before he does his famous

"head in the bowling ball
cleaner" routine again.

18:16.534 --> 18:20.100
[LAUGHING]

18:20.100 --> 18:22.501

that we send him

18:22.501 --> 18:24.567
the traditional arrangement
of balloons with ears

18:24.567 --> 18:27.300

18:33.267 --> 18:35.100
Motion carries,

18:35.100 --> 18:37.367
Which brings me to
our thought for tonight:

18:37.367 --> 18:39.033
Hair.

18:39.033 --> 18:41.334
How can we stop it?

18:41.334 --> 18:45.000
Now, I admit that, at one time,
man might have needed hair,

18:45.000 --> 18:46.701
like in prehistoric times

18:46.701 --> 18:50.067
when very large birds
flew overhead

18:50.067 --> 18:52.400
and hats hadn't been invented,

18:52.400 --> 18:54.234
but times have changed.

18:54.234 --> 18:56.634
The point is
the bald are more evolved,

18:56.634 --> 18:59.834
more intelligent
and more sophisticated.

18:59.834 --> 19:02.934
So the next time
a hairy child comes up and says,

19:02.934 --> 19:04.734
"Hey, let me rub your head
for luck,"

19:04.734 --> 19:05.934
you just tell that child,

19:05.934 --> 19:08.801
"That's not what
your mother rubbed."

21:56.734 --> 21:59.267
And?

22:01.133 --> 22:02.834
That's it. That's the news.

22:02.834 --> 22:04.734
Honey,

22:04.734 --> 22:06.501
I've known that
since the day

22:06.501 --> 22:09.300
you got down
on your knees to propose.

22:11.534 --> 22:13.267
Then you still think
I'm attractive?

22:13.267 --> 22:15.501
Oh, Steve.

22:15.501 --> 22:17.033
Of course I do.

22:17.033 --> 22:18.567
Anybody would.

22:18.567 --> 22:19.601
Well, somebody doesn't.

22:19.601 --> 22:21.200
Look what somebody put
on my desk.

22:21.200 --> 22:22.934
I put that there.

22:22.934 --> 22:24.167
Why?

22:24.167 --> 22:25.567
Because it was
your turn to shop,

22:25.567 --> 22:27.300
and tuna,
"three for $1.49,"

22:27.300 --> 22:29.133
is a great deal.

22:44.234 --> 22:46.133
