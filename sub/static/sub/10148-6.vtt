WEBVTT

01:35.763 --> 01:37.640
The penthouse suite as you requested.

01:37.723 --> 01:39.100
Finest view in the city.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.235
Will you need anything else, sir?

01:51.696 --> 01:52.696
Privacy.

01:56.367 --> 01:57.367
Yes, sir.

02:51.047 --> 02:52.048
You were right.

02:52.131 --> 02:53.799
<i>They're into recycling big time.</i>

02:53.883 --> 02:55.217
There's only one hitch.

02:55.301 --> 02:56.886
Those cars are stolen.

02:56.969 --> 02:58.304
I guess that's my cue.

03:00.639 --> 03:01.766
What the... Ahh!

03:08.230 --> 03:09.230
Slag him!

03:25.247 --> 03:27.666
<i>Oh, and, Terry,
there was one other thing.</i>

03:27.750 --> 03:29.251
- Yeah?
- Your mother celled.

03:29.335 --> 03:31.337
She wants you to pick up some milk
on the way home.

03:31.921 --> 03:32.921
Milk?

03:40.388 --> 03:42.098
That's gonna have to wait.

04:01.242 --> 04:02.242
Terry?

04:03.577 --> 04:04.577
Te r?

04:05.371 --> 04:06.497
Huh? What?

04:06.831 --> 04:08.165
Did you get the milk last night?

04:09.250 --> 04:11.001
Jeez, I forgot. Sorry, Mom.

04:11.085 --> 04:12.211
I was totally slagged.

04:12.503 --> 04:14.713
Ter, I know you've been
working hard for Mr. Wayne

04:14.797 --> 04:15.899
and I'm really proud of you,

04:15.923 --> 04:17.508
but I need your help too.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.191
Keeping this house running isn't easy...

04:19.260 --> 04:21.071
Especially when you're studying
for that dumb exam.

04:21.095 --> 04:24.765
Look, I need to pass that certification
to get a promotion at work.

04:25.057 --> 04:27.351
It's hard,
but I just can't do everything alone.

04:29.019 --> 04:31.355
I know. I'm sorry. I'II pitch in more.

04:32.189 --> 04:33.189
I promise.

04:41.740 --> 04:42.741
Housekeeping.

04:50.124 --> 04:51.125
Go away.

06:25.177 --> 06:27.346
Remember, I promised my mom
I'd be home early tonight,

06:27.429 --> 06:28.764
so she can study for her test.

06:28.847 --> 06:30.015
<i>First things first.</i>

06:30.474 --> 06:33.435
<i>I just picked up a break-in
at the Casemore Tribal Arts Gallery.</i>

06:33.811 --> 06:34.811
I'm on it.

06:41.026 --> 06:42.026
Sloppy.

06:42.611 --> 06:44.530
Whoever did this must've wanted company.

06:51.370 --> 06:52.705
You should see this place.

06:52.788 --> 06:54.415
Antiques, relics.

06:54.790 --> 06:55.791
You'd feel right at home.

06:55.874 --> 06:56.874
Cute.

07:18.314 --> 07:19.148
Whoa.

07:19.231 --> 07:20.316
The natives are restless.

07:22.318 --> 07:23.319
Come on out.

07:34.246 --> 07:36.248
Is that all the fight you have in you?

08:04.526 --> 08:05.903
Ready to call it quits?

08:08.238 --> 08:09.238
Never.

08:20.250 --> 08:21.085
0th

08:21.168 --> 08:22.753
Terry, are you all right?

08:25.839 --> 08:26.839
Yeah.

08:26.965 --> 08:28.342
But our mystery guest's gone.

08:35.599 --> 08:36.725
Who was that guy?

08:55.869 --> 08:56.912
Late again.

08:57.329 --> 08:58.539
Mom! Matt!

09:00.833 --> 09:02.167
Sorry, I got hung up.

09:02.251 --> 09:04.378
Terry, you knew I was counting on you.

09:04.712 --> 09:06.088
Someone's gonna get it.

09:06.171 --> 09:07.464
Zip the lip, twip.

09:07.840 --> 09:08.924
Look, I've gotta run.

09:09.007 --> 09:10.592
You boys are on your own for dinner.

09:11.760 --> 09:12.845
Stay out of trouble.

09:12.928 --> 09:14.388
Don't worry about us. We'll be fine.

09:14.763 --> 09:16.598
- Hey.
- So where do you wanna eat?

09:16.682 --> 09:18.267
How about Cheezy Dan's?

09:18.350 --> 09:20.686
- Again?
- Yeah, it's the greatest.

09:20.769 --> 09:23.605
They've got pizza and games
and all kinds of cool stuff.

09:23.689 --> 09:24.689
Whatever.

09:49.548 --> 09:50.548
Terry.

09:51.133 --> 09:52.509
Hey, Max, what are you doing here?

09:52.593 --> 09:55.804
Playing Fragatron 3000.
The games here kick.

09:55.888 --> 09:57.055
See? I told you.

09:57.139 --> 09:58.932
- Who's the twip?
- My brother Matt.

09:59.016 --> 10:00.392
Max is in my genetics class.

10:00.476 --> 10:02.853
Cool! They have <i>Death Ray Buckaroos!</i>

10:03.103 --> 10:04.103
Later.

10:13.155 --> 10:14.155
Oh, no.

10:14.740 --> 10:15.741
This is not good.

10:16.867 --> 10:19.203
- Come on, Matt.
- Hey, I'm not done yet.

10:19.536 --> 10:20.536
Max.

10:20.913 --> 10:22.498
I just got a call from my boss.

10:22.581 --> 10:24.267
Can you keep an eye on the twip
till I get back?

10:24.291 --> 10:26.126
No sweat. Help yourself, kid.

10:26.210 --> 10:27.210
Thanks.

10:29.755 --> 10:30.756
We've got trouble.

10:33.967 --> 10:34.843
What is it?

10:34.927 --> 10:36.404
You know that freak
from the art gallery?

10:36.428 --> 10:37.262
He's following me.

10:37.346 --> 10:38.347
<i>Try and lose him.</i>

10:38.430 --> 10:39.932
<i>I'll see what I can come up with.</i>

10:57.866 --> 10:59.451
Your money or a pie.

10:59.535 --> 11:00.535
Some other time.

11:07.918 --> 11:09.336
That's not funny, man.

11:22.307 --> 11:23.600
What's your hurry, dreg?

11:23.892 --> 11:25.227
You've gotta help, Officer.

11:25.310 --> 11:26.770
This nut with a spear's after me.

11:27.563 --> 11:29.857
A spear, huh? That's a new one.

11:29.940 --> 11:31.108
Can you describe him?

11:31.191 --> 11:33.861
Six-foot-four, half-naked,
tattoos all over his body.

11:33.944 --> 11:34.944
You can't miss him.

11:35.028 --> 11:35.863
Uh-huh.

11:35.946 --> 11:37.197
May I see your ID?

11:37.281 --> 11:39.032
I'm not scamming. Check it out.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.033
Wait here.

11:46.748 --> 11:47.748
Nothing.

11:53.505 --> 11:54.505
Williams?

12:26.997 --> 12:28.040
I don't think I shook him.

12:28.540 --> 12:29.540
<i>Who is this guy?</i>

12:31.627 --> 12:34.630
<i>According to INTERPOL files,
he's known as the Stalker.</i>

12:34.713 --> 12:35.714
A big game hunter

12:35.797 --> 12:37.883
who's wanted on three continents
for poaching.

12:37.966 --> 12:40.469
He only goes after
the most dangerous predators.

12:40.928 --> 12:41.929
So why is he on my case?

12:48.810 --> 12:49.978
Hey, what's going on?

12:51.813 --> 12:54.942
Hey, keep it down. I'm sleeping here.

13:00.948 --> 13:02.074
Somebody get me out of here!

13:16.713 --> 13:19.716
Easy, man. It's a newjacket.

13:21.802 --> 13:22.802
No.

13:38.443 --> 13:39.443
What happened to you?

13:39.653 --> 13:40.570
Long story.

13:40.654 --> 13:41.654
Where's Matt?

13:42.406 --> 13:43.406
He went tubing.

13:43.824 --> 13:45.344
Great.
I'll never get him out of there.

13:46.034 --> 13:47.661
Come on, twip. Time to go.

13:50.080 --> 13:52.124
I'm warning you,
don't make me come up there.

13:55.919 --> 13:56.919
Mattie?

14:05.137 --> 14:06.137
Oh, no.

14:26.700 --> 14:27.993
Just as I suspected.

14:28.076 --> 14:30.537
That flash grenade covered you
and everything you touched

14:30.620 --> 14:32.497
with a microscopic phosphorous powder.

14:33.749 --> 14:35.333
When viewed through a special lens,

14:35.417 --> 14:37.419
you must have stood out
like a Roman candle.

14:37.502 --> 14:40.088
So that's how he tracked me,
and how he found Matt.

14:40.172 --> 14:41.506
It wasn't your fault.

14:41.923 --> 14:43.383
But if anything happens to him...

14:44.009 --> 14:45.009
It won't.

14:45.260 --> 14:46.511
I found this in the pocket.

14:51.099 --> 14:52.099
It's a map.

14:52.142 --> 14:53.142
No.

14:53.435 --> 14:54.435
A trap.

15:07.866 --> 15:09.201
What are you gonna do, mister?

15:09.284 --> 15:11.286
Cut my heart out? Eat my liver?

15:11.703 --> 15:12.829
Don't be dramatic.

15:13.246 --> 15:14.539
You are merely bait.

15:16.792 --> 15:17.792
Freaky.

15:18.085 --> 15:19.294
What happened to your back?

15:19.377 --> 15:20.629
A hunting accident.

15:22.047 --> 15:23.298
<i>The panther was wounded.</i>

15:24.758 --> 15:25.884
<i>And I was careless.</i>

15:28.553 --> 15:29.553
Ouch.

15:29.721 --> 15:32.015
My back was broken in five places.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.311
<i>- They had to replace my spine.</i>

15:36.394 --> 15:38.730
<i>The operation was excruciating.</i>

15:50.951 --> 15:54.079
<i>But it artificially enhanced
my strength and reflexes.</i>

16:00.836 --> 16:02.921
<i>After I recovered, I went back,</i>

16:03.421 --> 16:06.174
<i>and, with my bare hands, got my revenge.</i>

16:28.864 --> 16:31.366
<i>It was easy. Too easy.</i>

16:32.117 --> 16:34.953
<i>I had become so powerful,
no prey could challenge me.</i>

16:35.453 --> 16:37.497
To one who lives
for the thrill of the hunt,

16:37.956 --> 16:38.999
this was a tragedy.

16:39.082 --> 16:40.208
My life was over,

16:40.292 --> 16:43.336
until I heard that
the legendary Batman had returned.

16:43.420 --> 16:44.504
Batman?

16:44.588 --> 16:48.258
I'd always imagined this Batman
to be an ageless soul

16:48.341 --> 16:50.510
inhabiting the greatest warrior
of each generation.

16:55.348 --> 16:58.018
If this bat spirit really existed,

16:58.560 --> 17:01.021
it would present the ultimate challenge.

17:01.104 --> 17:02.189
You want a fight, dreg?

17:02.272 --> 17:03.272
Let's go.

17:05.192 --> 17:06.192
Cool.

17:11.948 --> 17:12.948
Impressive.

17:13.325 --> 17:14.576
You've drawn first blood.

17:15.452 --> 17:17.204
Now it's my turn.

17:35.096 --> 17:37.557
You're the legendary Batman?

17:37.641 --> 17:40.018
The dark demon of the concrete jungle?

17:47.943 --> 17:49.110
Pathetic.

17:54.824 --> 17:56.076
[yelpingl

18:25.272 --> 18:26.272
Yeah!

18:31.111 --> 18:33.697
I've stalked kittens
with more tooth than you.

18:34.406 --> 18:35.406
Meow.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.118
Whoa!

18:38.451 --> 18:40.787
For that, I'll drink your blood.

18:46.293 --> 18:47.293
Huh?

19:03.768 --> 19:05.228
Hunting season's over.

19:08.523 --> 19:09.858
No. Impossible.

19:13.278 --> 19:15.280
You're a devil! Stay back!

19:43.808 --> 19:44.808
Weird.

19:47.270 --> 19:48.313
What happened to him?

19:48.646 --> 19:50.273
He was running from his own demons.

19:51.441 --> 19:52.841
Looks like they finally caught him.

19:56.196 --> 19:57.697
You should've been there, Mom.

19:57.781 --> 19:58.990
It was awesome.

19:59.074 --> 20:00.784
Matt, I was so worried.

20:01.076 --> 20:04.329
There was this big guy with a spear
and tattoos all over his body

20:04.412 --> 20:05.663
and he put me in this cage.

20:06.081 --> 20:07.916
What? Why?

20:07.999 --> 20:09.000
I don't know.

20:09.084 --> 20:11.419
Then Batman showed up
and barn, Wham, pow!

20:11.503 --> 20:12.503
He saved me!

20:13.713 --> 20:15.131
Batman's so cool.

20:15.423 --> 20:16.674
Not a loser like you.

20:16.758 --> 20:18.885
Hey, we can't all be Batman.
