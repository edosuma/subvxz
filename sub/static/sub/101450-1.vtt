06:11.347 --> 06:13.582
What if you guys came
in to use your guitar,

06:13.616 --> 06:16.285

06:55.491 --> 06:56.191
Yo, can I talk to

07:23.419 --> 07:25.187
Drummers count off songs,
you guys know that,

07:25.220 --> 07:26.955
everybody knows that, we all
learned that in the beginning,

07:26.989 --> 07:29.258
he tries to count off the
song, that's not gonna work,

07:29.291 --> 07:30.459
'cause drummers
count off the song,

07:30.492 --> 07:31.660
he counts the song,
it doesn't work,

07:31.694 --> 07:32.328
drummer counts off
the song, it's good...

07:32.361 --> 07:33.562
Listen...

07:33.595 --> 07:34.930
No no no no no,
I will not dude,

07:34.963 --> 07:36.198
I need to make this point,

07:36.231 --> 07:39.568
it's that, it's
either me or it's him.

07:39.601 --> 07:42.171
He writes all the songs, man.

07:42.204 --> 07:44.673
You just play drums, hold on,

07:44.707 --> 07:47.810
I don't know why we can't just
defer this to next weekend,

07:47.842 --> 07:49.978
we have a show on Saturday.

07:50.012 --> 07:51.513
Just play drums?

07:53.482 --> 07:54.383
That's what you think of me?

07:54.416 --> 07:55.884
I don't mean it like that.

07:55.918 --> 07:57.119
You said it like that's
what you fuckin' meant,

07:57.152 --> 07:58.787
like I'm not as
important as him.

07:58.821 --> 08:00.956
Well, do you do anything
other than play drums?

08:00.989 --> 08:04.526
I do lots of things, I
introduce people to people,

08:04.560 --> 08:05.728
I introduced you to Kirk,

08:05.761 --> 08:06.562
you wouldn't even
know that motherfucker

08:06.595 --> 08:08.063
if it wasn't for me.

08:08.097 --> 08:09.331
Thank you dude.

08:09.365 --> 08:12.134
- I introduced you to Kirk.
- Thank you.

08:12.167 --> 08:13.001
- Was it you?
- It was me.

08:13.035 --> 08:13.936
No.

08:13.969 --> 08:15.137
You introduced me to Kirk,

08:15.170 --> 08:16.405
I introduced Mark to Kirk.

08:16.438 --> 08:19.274
Guys, I'm the fuckin' rhythm,

08:19.308 --> 08:24.079
I'm the reason that the girls
feel it in their bodies, man.

08:24.113 --> 08:26.782
Why don't you guys just
try to, I don't know,

08:26.815 --> 08:29.485
start the song at the same time?

08:30.619 --> 08:34.256
Oh my god, you're
saying that we can just

08:34.289 --> 08:36.958
start the song at the same
time, and stay both in the band.

08:36.991 --> 08:37.793
Yes.

08:37.826 --> 08:38.626
He can count off.

08:38.659 --> 08:39.861
Yeah.

08:39.895 --> 08:40.962
And I can just
let him count off.

08:40.996 --> 08:42.498
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

08:42.530 --> 08:44.166
Okay okay okay okay, that
sounds cool, I'm sorry guys,

08:44.198 --> 08:45.634
- I freaked out.
- Sweet dude.

08:45.667 --> 08:48.170
Dude, fuck you, you fuckin'
piece of fuckin' dog shit,

08:48.203 --> 08:50.873

08:57.413 --> 08:59.581
You're not a bitch, man.

09:04.653 --> 09:06.155
Fuckin' asshole.

09:11.560 --> 09:12.694
Robbie quit.

09:15.964 --> 09:16.799

09:19.968 --> 09:21.670
Okay.

09:21.703 --> 09:24.206

What about that kid from last
weekend, what was his name?

09:30.746 --> 09:31.580
Hold on.

09:33.115 --> 09:34.082
Do I know him?

09:34.116 --> 09:34.950
Um, Tad.

09:37.519 --> 09:39.154
No, it's Brad,

09:39.188 --> 09:43.358

cousin's husband or whatever?

09:43.392 --> 09:47.362
No, his name was Tad,
he responds to Tad.

09:47.396 --> 09:48.898
Was it Brad?

09:48.932 --> 09:50.632
His name is not Tad.

09:50.666 --> 09:53.068
What was that band
he was in called?

09:53.101 --> 09:54.536

09:58.407 --> 10:00.542

- Tokyo Sunrise,

10:00.576 --> 10:02.010
whatever happened to them?

10:02.044 --> 10:03.412
No, their
lead singer moved to Seattle.

10:03.445 --> 10:04.914
Brad?

10:04.948 --> 10:07.884
Aren't you talkin' about
the drummer from last week?

10:07.917 --> 10:09.084
Yes.

10:09.117 --> 10:10.519
He's got red fuckin' hair.

10:10.552 --> 10:14.456
Okay, well I don't
see hair color, guys,

10:14.490 --> 10:15.959
you know that about me.

10:25.734 --> 10:26.635
Hello?

10:26.668 --> 10:28.704
Yo, Tad, Brad, it's Al,

10:28.737 --> 10:31.573
guitar player from Long Longs

10:31.607 --> 10:32.541
Oh hey man, what's up?

10:32.574 --> 10:34.042
How's it goin'?

10:34.076 --> 10:35.979
So we're lookin' for a
drummer for this Saturday,

10:36.011 --> 10:37.279
and possibly permanently,

10:37.312 --> 10:38.647
you're livin' in
Phoenix now, right?

10:38.680 --> 10:40.182
Yeah, yeah I am.

10:40.215 --> 10:42.484
Cool, so it's me
and this guy Kirk,

10:42.518 --> 10:43.719
he's our lead singer,

10:43.752 --> 10:46.288
bass player, songwriter,
you know Kirk?

10:46.321 --> 10:47.756
Yeah, I know him.

10:47.789 --> 10:49.091
I mean, I don't know him
personally, but I know of him,

10:49.124 --> 10:51.693
I love his stuff, yeah.

10:51.727 --> 10:56.198
Cool, so about Saturday,
it's this bullshit local thing,

10:56.231 --> 10:58.367
but if you win they let you
play a song on the news,

10:58.400 --> 11:00.904
you should hear this fucking
song we have man, it's insane.

11:00.937 --> 11:02.437
I'm gonna text you directions,

11:02.471 --> 11:04.908
but if I can have easy, you
should probably head over now,

11:04.941 --> 11:06.174
and yeah...

11:11.647 --> 11:12.814
Hello?

11:12.848 --> 11:13.849
Yeah yeah yeah, sorry,
text me the address,

11:13.883 --> 11:15.183
I'm on my way right now.

11:15.217 --> 11:16.953
All right.

11:27.964 --> 11:31.133
Ah, when is this
kid gonna get here?

11:32.834 --> 11:34.202
I'm so bored.

11:34.236 --> 11:36.138
Oh shit, you know
what I just remembered?

11:36.171 --> 11:37.072
What?

11:37.105 --> 11:38.407
That Morgan whatever the fuck,

11:38.440 --> 11:40.275
his brother was in
that band Garbageface,

11:40.309 --> 11:41.710
he plays the drums.

11:41.743 --> 11:43.679
Garbageface, great name.

11:43.712 --> 11:45.681
Yeah, call him.

11:45.714 --> 11:46.983
Are you guys
talkin' about Ritner?

11:47.016 --> 11:48.150
Ritner.

11:48.183 --> 11:49.318
That's his name.

11:49.351 --> 11:50.319
Strange name.

11:50.352 --> 11:51.787
Oh, I know that guy.

11:51.820 --> 11:54.323
I mean, my opinion, Brad's
a way better drummer,

11:54.356 --> 11:57.026
there were no drums
in Garbageface.

11:57.060 --> 11:58.928
True, but Ritner knows people.

11:58.962 --> 12:01.898
Well, I mean, who
can get here first?

12:08.303 --> 12:09.671
Yo, I'm on my way.

12:09.705 --> 12:10.907
Oh excellent.

12:11.807 --> 12:14.776
Yo yo yo, oh shit, oh shit.

12:14.810 --> 12:16.012
Brad, hold on.

12:16.045 --> 12:18.180
Sorry, Tiffany
talked to Ritner,

12:18.213 --> 12:20.984
Kirk says first
come, first play.

12:22.150 --> 12:24.988
Okay, so Brad,
little change of plans,

12:25.021 --> 12:26.388
I guess there's another
drummer in the mix,

12:26.421 --> 12:28.256
Kirk's sayin' first
come first play,

12:28.290 --> 12:30.927
but I'm pullin' for you, bro.

12:30.960 --> 12:31.793
Oof.

12:32.962 --> 12:34.162
Okay, do you have the keys?

12:34.196 --> 12:35.764
We gotta go, he said
there's another drummer.

12:35.797 --> 12:37.000
In my purse, you know,

12:37.033 --> 12:38.500
I don't like this
two drummers thing,

12:38.533 --> 12:39.434
they called you first...

12:39.468 --> 12:40.669
Mom, where's your purse?

12:40.702 --> 12:41.470
It's on the floor
behind me, honey,

12:41.503 --> 12:42.671
I can't twist around.

12:42.704 --> 12:43.605
I don't
have time for this.

12:43.639 --> 12:44.706
Well, where is this place?

12:44.740 --> 12:45.874
It's in Tempe, it's not far.

12:45.908 --> 12:47.609
Okay, and who are these guys?

12:47.643 --> 12:48.443
What do you know about them?

12:49.711 --> 12:50.947
You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

12:50.980 --> 12:52.514
What, did I leave
the lights on again?

12:52.547 --> 12:53.950
I don't know, it's just
not fucking starting!

12:53.983 --> 12:56.251
Okay, language,
please, why the rush?

12:56.284 --> 12:58.553
Kirk said first
come first play.

12:58.587 --> 13:00.089
And who is Kirk?

13:02.091 --> 13:02.959
Who's Kirk?

13:03.859 --> 13:05.193
What are you?

13:05.227 --> 13:06.461
Mom, hold on.

13:06.495 --> 13:09.297
Okay, you can
just fix cars now?

13:11.633 --> 13:12.567
All right.

13:12.601 --> 13:14.037
Fucking bitch.

13:14.070 --> 13:14.870
Me?

13:14.904 --> 13:16.105
No, not you.

13:16.139 --> 13:17.606
This is what I don't
like about the cursin',

13:17.639 --> 13:18.874
you don't know if
you're talkin' to me,

13:18.908 --> 13:20.409
or the car, and now...

13:20.442 --> 13:21.610
What the fuck?

13:21.643 --> 13:22.844
I'm gonna call Triple A.

13:22.879 --> 13:24.246
Mom, Triple A could
take a fucking hour.

13:24.279 --> 13:25.313
What do you want?

13:25.347 --> 13:27.649
I don't know, I don' know,

13:27.683 --> 13:28.850
it's not even about talent,

13:28.885 --> 13:30.686
it's about who's
fucking car starts.

13:30.719 --> 13:35.657
Okay sweetheart, what do
you even know about this band?

13:35.691 --> 13:36.926
Honey...

13:36.959 --> 13:38.527
I'm done mom, I'm
done, I can't do it,

13:38.560 --> 13:42.364
it's another band, another
waste of fucking time.

13:42.397 --> 13:44.733
Sweetie, you're
too hard on yourself,

13:44.766 --> 13:46.903
and you're usin' the F
word like every sentence...

13:46.936 --> 13:48.971
Mom, people cuss when no
other words will suffice...

13:49.005 --> 13:52.708
That's a great word,
suffice is a great word.

13:52.741 --> 13:56.611
Okay, what about someone
like Christopher Cross?

13:56.645 --> 13:59.048
I don't even know who that is.

13:59.082 --> 14:03.119
Five time Grammy award
winner Christopher Cross.

14:03.152 --> 14:07.489
Okay, okay, well, I mean,
obviously, he's great.

14:07.522 --> 14:08.891
I have his CD, you
can listen to it,

14:08.925 --> 14:10.392
I used to have all of his...

14:10.425 --> 14:11.928
Mom mom, what are you even
talking about right now?

14:11.961 --> 14:13.795
Sorry, okay, my point is,

14:13.829 --> 14:16.966
you're not the first person
who's car didn't start, okay?

14:16.999 --> 14:19.168
The people who make it are
the ones that make it happen,

14:19.202 --> 14:20.836
car or no car, despite
getting stranded...

14:20.869 --> 14:22.370
Okay, okay okay.

14:23.940 --> 14:26.374
I'm gonna be in my 20s,
living with my mom,

14:26.408 --> 14:28.543
cleaning fucking Howard's piss.

14:28.577 --> 14:29.912
Okay, why not
just Howard's piss?

14:29.946 --> 14:31.513
Why F word, Howard's piss?

14:31.546 --> 14:33.015
What word won't suffice?

14:33.049 --> 14:35.784
It's words won't suffice,
not a word won't suffice.

14:35.817 --> 14:36.685
I don't
think that's right...

14:36.718 --> 14:38.054
- Yes it is.
- No.

14:39.488 --> 14:44.392
Okay, I know someone who had
to make it happen, guess.

14:44.426 --> 14:46.762
Mom, I don't know,
Christopher Cross?

14:46.795 --> 14:47.997
I don't know.

14:48.030 --> 14:50.465
Not Christopher
Cross, your dad.

14:53.502 --> 14:57.173
Daddy always made it
happen, no matter what.

15:28.870 --> 15:29.704
Hey, what's up guys?

15:29.738 --> 15:30.539
Oh fuck.

15:30.572 --> 15:31.807
Hey, what's up Al?

15:31.840 --> 15:33.308
Hey bud.

15:33.341 --> 15:34.110
Thanks for calling me,
thanks for thinkin of me,

15:34.143 --> 15:34.843
Mark, what's up man?

15:34.877 --> 15:36.045
Hey brother.

15:36.078 --> 15:36.979
I'm Brad.

15:37.013 --> 15:38.346
Hi, Tiffany, this is my place.

15:38.380 --> 15:39.381
Hello Brad.

15:39.414 --> 15:41.217
Let's do this shit.

15:41.250 --> 15:42.751
Hey, sorry I'm late,

15:42.784 --> 15:44.086
I mean, the car broke down
on the way back from work,

15:44.120 --> 15:46.621
and it was just a
total shit show.

15:46.655 --> 15:48.090
You okay?

15:48.124 --> 15:49.058
Yeah yeah, I'm fine, I just
needed to make it happen,

15:49.091 --> 15:50.927
so I fuckin' ran here.

15:51.961 --> 15:53.495
Ritner here also, guys.

15:53.528 --> 15:54.563
- Oh hey Ritner...
- Hi Ritner!

15:54.596 --> 15:56.065
What's up, buddy?

15:56.098 --> 15:57.266
Yeah, what's up is this
fucking ginger motherfucker

15:57.300 --> 15:58.935
just pushed me outside.

15:58.968 --> 16:00.169
No I didn't.

16:00.203 --> 16:01.103
What the fuck
you talkin' about?

16:01.137 --> 16:03.206
We do not say push here, dude.

16:03.239 --> 16:04.806
He fuckin' laid
hands on me, dude.

16:04.840 --> 16:05.640
I did not.

16:05.674 --> 16:07.143
Bullshit.

16:07.176 --> 16:09.212
Well he looks like he ran
here, he looks disgusting,

16:09.245 --> 16:10.812
he's sweaty as fuck,
he looks awful,

16:10.846 --> 16:12.248
so he's gonna go first.

16:12.281 --> 16:13.049
What?

16:13.082 --> 16:15.117
First come first play.

16:15.151 --> 16:16.052
Exactly.

16:16.085 --> 16:17.586
Well nobody told me that shit,

16:17.619 --> 16:19.021
I've been sittin' outside
in my car for 10 minutes.

16:19.055 --> 16:20.223
Well maybe you shoulda been

16:20.256 --> 16:21.924
sittin' in here for
10 minutes dude,

16:21.958 --> 16:23.192
just chill the fuck out.

16:23.226 --> 16:24.392
Okay, what's the tempo?

16:24.426 --> 16:26.595
Yo, you wearing
drumming gloves, bro?

16:26.628 --> 16:27.997
Yeah, no sweat.

16:28.030 --> 16:29.265
Bitch.

16:29.298 --> 16:32.201
Dude, it's like one,

16:32.235 --> 16:35.938
Okay, so one, two,

16:35.972 --> 16:38.740
No, one, two,

16:39.708 --> 16:40.910
Okay, I got it, let's go.

16:40.943 --> 16:41.810
It sounds easy,
it's not though.

16:41.843 --> 16:42.744
I got it, I got it.

16:42.777 --> 16:44.379
All right.

16:44.412 --> 16:45.580
Will do.

16:45.614 --> 16:47.382
One, two, three.

16:48.351 --> 16:50.152
Yeah, okay, Ritner, you're up.

16:50.186 --> 16:50.987
No no no, I'm
sorry, one more...

16:51.020 --> 16:52.188
You're up.

16:52.221 --> 16:53.122
I just need
a sip of water...

16:53.155 --> 16:54.589
I told you, man, the intro.

16:54.623 --> 16:56.424
Kirk please, please, just
give me a sip of water.

16:56.458 --> 16:57.659
It's Ritner's turn.

16:57.692 --> 16:59.962
You didn't play

16:59.996 --> 17:01.563
Slack 'em.

17:01.596 --> 17:02.999

All right,

17:06.534 --> 17:08.204
Yeah man.

17:08.237 --> 17:10.172
We only have beer.

17:10.205 --> 17:13.142
That's awesome, thank you.

17:13.175 --> 17:15.211
I wanna see how

17:15.243 --> 17:18.180

17:18.214 --> 17:21.951
Yes.

17:30.026 --> 17:32.061

17:32.094 --> 17:37.099
♪ Let me in, let me

17:40.369 --> 17:42.570
♪ I am ready to go, ♪

17:42.604 --> 17:46.943
♪ He is on the blocks,
let the good times roll ♪

17:46.976 --> 17:50.980
Ready y'all, pre-chorus,

17:53.115 --> 17:54.649
Whoa, you all right?

17:54.683 --> 17:56.319
Fuck, it's fuckin' sprained...

17:56.352 --> 17:57.420
Too
aggressive on that...

17:57.452 --> 17:58.354
Put me in coach.

17:58.387 --> 17:59.487
Brad, you're up, man.

17:59.521 --> 18:00.923
My ankle's
sprained, man.

18:00.957 --> 18:03.758
Hey, I'm sorry, the
part's gotta beat the part.

18:03.792 --> 18:07.063
Dude, move
so Brad can get in.

18:08.230 --> 18:09.999
Horse shit.

18:10.032 --> 18:11.033
All right,
you got it man?

18:11.067 --> 18:12.268
Yeah, I won't mess it up.

18:12.301 --> 18:14.103
You won't mess
it up, all right.

18:14.136 --> 18:15.271
All right, ready?

18:15.304 --> 18:16.538
- One, two, three...
- Whoa, whoa,

18:16.571 --> 18:18.473
wait a minute, I
count it off dude,

18:18.506 --> 18:20.042
you don't have the microphone.

18:20.076 --> 18:22.078
One, two, three,

18:47.836 --> 18:50.739
Can I get more of
my guitar, please?

18:50.772 --> 18:52.308
Does my guitar sound super dead?

18:52.341 --> 18:53.242
You guys hear that?

18:53.275 --> 18:54.977
I got you maxed out, man.

18:55.011 --> 18:58.881
Yeah, still need more
of me voice, check check,

18:58.914 --> 19:01.017
no sty-vo, hello?

19:01.050 --> 19:04.552
Okay, I still can't
hear my brand new tele.

19:04.586 --> 19:05.754
Brand new, so.

19:07.223 --> 19:08.723
We need some
assistance, please.

19:08.757 --> 19:09.691
Wait.

19:12.861 --> 19:14.662
Dude, you got
that intro right?

19:14.696 --> 19:16.399
Yeah yeah, I got it.

19:16.432 --> 19:18.100
All right, just don't rush it.

19:18.134 --> 19:19.201
Keep it chill, man.

19:19.235 --> 19:20.635
I won't rush it.

19:20.668 --> 19:22.537
Bro, come on,
don't fuck with my stuff.

19:22.570 --> 19:24.340
Do you want to
cut through or not?

19:24.373 --> 19:26.008
You just, no,
you boost the trebles,

19:26.042 --> 19:29.111
you cut the mids, and then you
crank it, did you try that?

19:29.145 --> 19:30.612
That's a great idea.

19:30.645 --> 19:32.281
Okay, wow, and you have
your volumes up, right?

19:32.314 --> 19:33.516
Yeah, I have my volume up.

19:33.548 --> 19:34.682
All
right, play it.

19:34.716 --> 19:35.885
Hold on, I'm sorry,

19:35.918 --> 19:37.719
can I just get a little
more vocals for me?

19:37.752 --> 19:40.189
Drums need more Kirk, please.

19:40.222 --> 19:41.023
Just a teech.

19:41.057 --> 19:41.957
A teech of it.

19:41.991 --> 19:43.558
Drummer boy wants a teet.

19:43.591 --> 19:47.363
I can only do one
thing at a time.

19:47.396 --> 19:49.664
Well start by doin' that.

19:50.665 --> 19:51.901
What's up guys?

19:51.934 --> 19:52.834
Hi.

19:52.867 --> 19:54.537
Hi Brad.

20:01.477 --> 20:03.979
Hey, what's your band's name?

20:04.013 --> 20:04.846
Us?

20:06.248 --> 20:08.616
No, the other band I'm
lookin' at right now, yeah.

20:08.650 --> 20:09.784
Baby.

20:09.818 --> 20:11.586
Oh, our band name is...

20:11.619 --> 20:12.821
Glad Fan.

20:12.854 --> 20:13.655
- No.
- Nope.

20:13.688 --> 20:14.523
No.

20:16.125 --> 20:17.460
The Moody Boys.

20:17.493 --> 20:18.327
Ew, no.

20:19.761 --> 20:20.996
The Glad Fans, plural?

20:21.030 --> 20:22.031
You already said that.

20:22.064 --> 20:24.934
Just one, Shtibe, one each.

20:24.967 --> 20:25.867
My bad.

20:25.901 --> 20:27.802
Brad, it's your turn.

20:27.836 --> 20:29.338
Um, the Bangers?

20:32.640 --> 20:34.143
No.

20:34.176 --> 20:35.177
Brad, that's literally the
worst thing I've ever heard.

20:35.211 --> 20:36.512
I don't hate it.

20:36.545 --> 20:38.047
Does your bong have a name?

20:38.080 --> 20:41.250
Okay, shut the
fuck up, Al, go.

20:41.283 --> 20:42.485
Pass.

20:42.518 --> 20:43.319
That's
not how that works.

20:43.352 --> 20:44.587
Ken Rippy Jr.

20:45.753 --> 20:47.089
What?

20:47.123 --> 20:48.357
Ken Rippy Jr.

20:50.526 --> 20:52.027
I love that.

20:52.061 --> 20:54.662
Do you have somethin',
dude, just say it.

20:54.696 --> 20:57.233
Okay, fuck, Generation Smoke.

21:01.636 --> 21:04.440
Oh, Jesus Christ.

21:04.473 --> 21:05.707
Fuck you guys.

21:05.740 --> 21:08.177
That's so bad,
that's so bad, Al.

21:08.210 --> 21:11.147
I don't hear you comin'
up with anything better.

21:11.180 --> 21:13.748
Okay, well don't
embarrass yourself, man.

21:13.781 --> 21:16.085
Okay, well,
it's your turn.

21:16.118 --> 21:18.454
Okay, well don't
embarrass yourself, man.

21:18.487 --> 21:20.055
Okay, well,
it's still your turn.

21:20.089 --> 21:23.325
Dude, shut the
fuck up, I'm going.

21:23.359 --> 21:24.593
Okay, take it away then.

21:24.627 --> 21:25.827
Well every time I
talk, you fucking...

21:25.860 --> 21:29.031
Okay, we're all
waiting for you.

21:29.064 --> 21:30.499
- Okay.
- To go.

21:30.533 --> 21:33.102
Oh my god dude, okay,
you're not ready for this...

21:33.135 --> 21:34.603
We're not ready...

21:34.637 --> 21:35.538
You're not ready, no,
you're not ready for this.

21:35.571 --> 21:37.072
You're right, hold on.

21:37.106 --> 21:38.240
Are you now?

21:38.274 --> 21:39.175
- Now I'm ready.
- You ready now?

21:39.208 --> 21:41.443
Okay okay okay, Permafrost.

21:41.477 --> 21:42.278
Fuck.

21:43.913 --> 21:45.614
Oh my god.

21:45.648 --> 21:46.549
Computer.

21:49.218 --> 21:50.718
Where did you
come up with that?

21:50.752 --> 21:53.622
Yeah, that can actually
be really cool on a T shirt,

21:53.656 --> 21:55.823
in "Predator" font or somethin'?

21:55.857 --> 21:58.427
Fuckin' "Predator" font,
yes, "Predator" font.

21:58.460 --> 22:01.397
Did you know that was
originally title Hunter,

22:01.430 --> 22:03.165
and it didn't
change to "Predator"

22:03.199 --> 22:06.402
until after principal
photography?

22:06.435 --> 22:07.735
No.

22:07.769 --> 22:10.906
Okay, Permafrost, hey,
is everybody listening?

22:10.940 --> 22:11.907
Yes.

22:13.342 --> 22:16.378
Okay, meaning a thick
sub-surface layer of soil

22:16.412 --> 22:18.914
that remains frozen
throughout the year,

22:18.948 --> 22:22.618
occurring chiefly
in polar regions.

22:22.651 --> 22:23.886
Regions, sorry.

22:25.321 --> 22:27.822
All right, the only other
hit I got for Permafrost

22:27.855 --> 22:32.061
was a hybrid strain of
icky fuckin' sticky.

22:32.094 --> 22:32.995
Nice.

22:33.028 --> 22:34.463
Except I don't smoke anymore,

22:34.496 --> 22:37.466
because Rachel doesn't like
when I smoke, so I quit.

22:37.499 --> 22:38.634
What?

22:38.667 --> 22:39.568
Since when?

22:41.237 --> 22:43.372
I don't really feel like it's
a safe environment to share.

22:43.405 --> 22:44.406
Oh my god.

22:45.873 --> 22:49.912
Stop bein' so fuckin'
stupid, it's the no drugs?

22:49.945 --> 22:51.380
I'm married okay?

22:51.413 --> 22:54.782
We know you're married, Mark.

22:54.816 --> 22:58.254
Well, then you know,
occasionally, albeit not often,

22:58.287 --> 23:01.690
you have to make sacrifices
for the covenant of marriage.

23:01.724 --> 23:03.092
Uh, stupid.

23:04.126 --> 23:05.894
Occasionally.

23:05.928 --> 23:09.331
Whatever, it's just one
less mouth to feed to me, so.

23:09.365 --> 23:11.900
But seriously, Permafrost
is so fucking tight.

23:11.934 --> 23:14.236
Dude, thank you, thank you.

23:14.270 --> 23:15.070
I vote yes.

23:15.104 --> 23:15.904
Yeah?

23:15.938 --> 23:17.106
Same.

23:17.139 --> 23:18.607
Okay, so our band name...

23:18.641 --> 23:22.344
Whoa whoa whoa, guys,
we're fucking Permafrost.

23:27.116 --> 23:28.217
Permafrost.

23:29.084 --> 23:30.986
Yes, yeah, I love it!

23:33.622 --> 23:36.625
Our band name is Stylo
and the Murder Dogs.

23:36.659 --> 23:38.160
How
do you spell that?

23:38.193 --> 23:41.664
S-T-Y-L-O, as in Stylo,

23:41.697 --> 23:45.634
murder as in blood and
dogs as in fuckin' pugs.

23:47.569 --> 23:48.404
Great.

23:57.112 --> 23:58.580
Bro, he changed
the name of the band

23:58.614 --> 24:01.050
right in front of our eyes
as a test for you, man.

24:01.083 --> 24:02.584
For me?

24:02.618 --> 24:05.754
Yeah, he's testin' your
loyalty to the band, bro.

24:05.788 --> 24:08.390
Oh shit, you're right.

24:08.424 --> 24:11.126
You gotta close
him, dude, cig?

24:13.028 --> 24:15.664
So how
exactly do I do that?

24:15.698 --> 24:19.335
Well, everyone wants to
be in his band, you know?

24:19.368 --> 24:22.705
You saw fucking Ritner,
we are all replaceable,

24:22.738 --> 24:25.541
Kirk is only taking
the committed.

24:25.574 --> 24:27.443
Right, so he
changed the band name

24:27.476 --> 24:29.844
to see if I was committed
enough to call him out for it.

24:29.878 --> 24:31.714
Exactly, to prove that

24:31.747 --> 24:34.750
you wanna be in this
band, officially.

24:34.783 --> 24:36.819
This is great, because I
overheard Kirk and Candice

24:36.851 --> 24:37.986
talking about
Ritner, and I just...

24:38.020 --> 24:40.389
No no no, fuck fucking Ritner,

24:40.422 --> 24:41.657
don't even think about Ritner,

24:41.690 --> 24:43.759
right now you need
to concentrate on

24:43.792 --> 24:46.495
proving your loyalty
to Kirk, you know?

24:46.528 --> 24:48.130
Yeah, dude, thank you so much,

24:48.163 --> 24:49.832
I literally had zero idea

24:49.864 --> 24:51.967
Kirk was operating on this
kinda intellectual level.

24:52.000 --> 24:52.801
Yeah.

24:52.835 --> 24:54.036
Is that fucked up?

24:54.069 --> 24:56.972
Well, I've learned
to never underestimate

24:57.005 --> 25:01.009
the power of prescription
medication, my friend.

25:03.979 --> 25:04.813
Marky.

25:04.847 --> 25:06.014
Hey.

25:06.048 --> 25:07.282
Is your wife
comin' tonight?

25:07.316 --> 25:09.017
Nope, she's gotta
work in the mornin',

25:09.051 --> 25:10.586
so you know what that means.

25:13.889 --> 25:17.559
Oh, you're gonna smoke
some weed about it.

25:18.927 --> 25:22.731
No, it was a drinking
reference, we're gonna drink.

25:22.765 --> 25:23.599
Oh.

25:25.167 --> 25:26.535
Hey, excuse me, Kirk?

25:29.505 --> 25:30.339
Hey, Kirk?

25:32.074 --> 25:33.842
Hey, Kirk man, sorry.

25:33.877 --> 25:35.010
What's up?

25:35.043 --> 25:36.812
Well I noticed
that we, or that you,

25:36.845 --> 25:39.415
didn't say Permafrost when the
guy asked for our band name.

25:39.448 --> 25:40.249
MmmHmm.

25:40.282 --> 25:41.183
Is that...

25:41.216 --> 25:42.117
He's talking about

25:42.151 --> 25:43.051
Stylo and the Murder Dogs, babe.

25:43.085 --> 25:44.853
Oh, I changed the name.

25:46.455 --> 25:47.823
It's
so fucking sick.

25:47.856 --> 25:49.858
Okay, that's cool.

25:49.893 --> 25:50.926
I changed the name.

25:50.959 --> 25:52.361
What's Stylo?

25:52.394 --> 25:54.329
- It's my last name.
- It's his last name, Brad.

25:54.363 --> 25:56.565
Oh right, yeah, I knew that.

25:56.598 --> 25:59.701
Pursely didn't
love Permafrost, so.

26:01.804 --> 26:03.539
Rachel's gonna think
we're not serious

26:03.572 --> 26:07.276
if we keep changin'
the name, dude.

26:07.309 --> 26:08.610
What?

26:08.644 --> 26:11.213
I'm just processing
that out loud.

26:11.246 --> 26:12.347
Mark's high.

26:12.381 --> 26:14.149
No, Mark's drunk.

26:14.183 --> 26:17.820
Okay, so the new
new band name is

26:17.853 --> 26:20.856
Stylo and the Murder Dogs, then?

26:20.890 --> 26:22.758
Kirk Slasher Cats.

26:24.993 --> 26:27.963
Ha ha, it's that funny, dude?

26:27.996 --> 26:31.767
Is that a joke to you,
the band name's a joke?

26:31.800 --> 26:34.036
No no, I think it's cool.

26:35.270 --> 26:36.505
Fuck it.

26:36.538 --> 26:40.309
Guys, we're Stylo and
the fucking Murder Dogs.

26:41.844 --> 26:43.846
Yeah, fuck Permafrost.

26:45.314 --> 26:47.716
Ladies and gentlemen, make
sure to vote after the show,

26:47.749 --> 26:49.585
the winner of
tonight's competition

26:49.618 --> 26:51.854
gets to play on the news,

26:51.888 --> 26:53.890
that's right, Good
Morning Phoenix.

26:57.459 --> 26:59.061
Anyway, put your hands together,

26:59.094 --> 27:01.363
or should I say, paws together,

27:01.396 --> 27:04.533
for Stylo and the Murder Dogs!

27:04.566 --> 27:05.367
Nice guys.

27:10.339 --> 27:11.340
Excuse me.

27:12.708 --> 27:16.812
Check, check, check, check,
four five six, six, six.

27:17.881 --> 27:19.781
My shit's not
working, this isn't on.

27:19.815 --> 27:22.718
What's up, my fellow species?

27:22.751 --> 27:26.421
I'm not gettin'
anything out of this, man.

27:27.322 --> 27:29.758
Yeah, it's blown, good luck.

27:29.791 --> 27:30.759
Can you play without it?

27:30.792 --> 27:31.995
Yeah.

27:32.027 --> 27:32.794
We gotta
play without it.

27:32.828 --> 27:33.997
I got it, I got it.

27:34.062 --> 27:35.965
Hey, somebody get
that guy a chode to eat,

27:35.999 --> 27:38.500

Jew.

30:32.474 --> 30:33.976
What?

30:34.010 --> 30:35.078
That's the lead singer of
Jimmy Eat World over there.

30:35.111 --> 30:36.511
Oh shit.

30:37.612 --> 30:40.049
It's only a matter of time.

30:40.917 --> 30:41.717
Dammit.

30:41.750 --> 30:43.285
Watch the master.

30:43.318 --> 30:45.154
Yo, you want me to go
get us another drink?

30:45.188 --> 30:47.656
Yeah, yeah, a beer, please.

30:47.689 --> 30:49.825
You think it's
fine that I'm not 21?

30:49.858 --> 30:52.427
Yeah dude, we're here,
it's fine, whatever,

30:52.461 --> 30:55.031
but ask her, that's Melanie.

30:59.634 --> 31:00.602
All right.

31:01.737 --> 31:03.106
Good luck, bud.

31:08.844 --> 31:10.746
Hey, how's your night goin'?

31:10.779 --> 31:12.447
It's good, what
are you having?

31:12.481 --> 31:14.050
I'll take a beer.

31:18.921 --> 31:21.423
Thank you, oh, can I
actually get one more?

31:21.456 --> 31:22.390
I'm sorry.

31:22.424 --> 31:23.325
Is that it?

31:23.358 --> 31:25.928
Yeah, just one, just one more.

31:27.897 --> 31:30.066
You did such
good drumming, sir.

31:30.099 --> 31:32.267
So good, he's our new drummer,

31:32.300 --> 31:33.435
Melanie's my roommate.

31:33.468 --> 31:34.369
Oh wow.

31:34.402 --> 31:35.537
I'm bummed I missed it.

31:35.570 --> 31:38.640
It's okay, there'll
be another one.

31:39.808 --> 31:41.843
She's fucking British,
can you imagine that?

31:41.878 --> 31:42.778
Yeah, I can.

31:42.811 --> 31:44.080
She's a nasty little kitten.

31:44.113 --> 31:46.082
I'm a cat person.

31:46.115 --> 31:47.749
You're so fucking cute.

31:47.783 --> 31:49.986
Oh, listen, before I forget,

31:50.019 --> 31:51.453
Kirk wanted me to tell you

31:51.486 --> 31:55.191
that you are
officially in the band.

31:55.224 --> 31:56.092
Are you messing with me?

31:56.125 --> 31:57.059
No.

31:57.093 --> 31:58.393
I passed the test?

31:58.426 --> 31:59.361
Sure.

31:59.394 --> 32:01.230
Hell, yeah, thank you!

32:01.264 --> 32:04.167
We're Stylo and the
fucking Murder Dogs, cheers!

32:06.334 --> 32:07.602
Okay.

32:07.636 --> 32:10.872
God damn it, I'm
so excited for us.

32:10.907 --> 32:11.706
Also.

32:12.909 --> 32:15.011
Oh no, I have work
tomorrow, I'm sorry.

32:15.044 --> 32:16.745
Is this what you're
gonna be like on tour?

32:16.778 --> 32:17.679
A little baby bitch?

32:17.712 --> 32:18.915
No no no, I promise you,

32:18.948 --> 32:21.150
I just have work in the
morning, and I don't...

32:21.184 --> 32:23.351
I'll put in a good word.

32:27.056 --> 32:28.723
Oh my god, what even is this?

32:28.757 --> 32:29.825
I don't know, it
feels like weed,

32:29.858 --> 32:31.359
can you chew it, please?

32:31.393 --> 32:33.528
Here, just put it in your mouth.

32:40.203 --> 32:42.804
You're an angel, Brad,
you're a fucking rockstar.

32:42.838 --> 32:44.040
Yeah.

32:44.073 --> 32:44.706
You gotta fuckin'
act like one, bro.

32:44.739 --> 32:45.942
Yeah, okay.

32:45.975 --> 32:47.910
Let's go, can I get
a shot or something?

33:32.188 --> 33:34.756
Sweetheart, Bradley, wake up.

33:36.758 --> 33:38.194
Mom, what?

33:38.227 --> 33:40.329
You gotta get out, I gotta
go home and ice my back.

33:40.363 --> 33:41.163
Mom, what?

33:41.197 --> 33:42.031
Go.

33:43.465 --> 33:45.767
Hey Ms. Jaffey, I don't
think we've officially met,

33:45.800 --> 33:47.069
I'm Al, guitar player.

33:47.103 --> 33:49.604
Hi Al, guitar
player, how you doin'?

33:49.638 --> 33:51.040
Good, how are you?

33:51.073 --> 33:53.142
I'm good, sorry I missed
the show last night.

33:53.175 --> 33:54.310
Oh, that's
okay, don't apologize.

33:54.343 --> 33:55.677
Yeah, I got these
back problems,

33:55.710 --> 33:57.545
I was flat on the
living room floor,

33:57.579 --> 33:58.413
takin' my pain meds.

33:58.446 --> 33:59.248
Whoa.

33:59.282 --> 34:01.516
Yeah, hey, come here,

34:01.549 --> 34:04.419
what'd you guys get
up to last night?

34:04.452 --> 34:06.088
He went straight
home after the show.

34:06.122 --> 34:08.224
Oh no, honey, he didn't.

34:08.257 --> 34:09.190
What?

34:09.225 --> 34:11.360
Yeah, do a little drinkin'?

34:11.393 --> 34:12.560
What?

34:12.594 --> 34:14.964
You know, sex, drugs,
rock 'n roll, right?

34:14.996 --> 34:16.232
Of course not.

34:16.264 --> 34:17.799
- X, pills maybe?
- No, Ms. Jaffrey.

34:17.831 --> 34:19.801
- Crank, meth, coke.
- Of course not.

34:19.833 --> 34:21.469
- Heroin, right?
- We're Christians.

34:21.503 --> 34:25.408
And my kid is underage,
do you understand me?

34:25.440 --> 34:26.275
Uh huh.

34:27.676 --> 34:32.014
Mmmhmm, lean back for me,
bud, there you go, yeah.

34:34.616 --> 34:35.418
There you go.

34:35.449 --> 34:36.583
There you go, buddy.

34:36.618 --> 34:37.585
There you go
Brad, are you good?

34:37.619 --> 34:38.453
Mmmhmm.

34:40.655 --> 34:41.822
MmmMmm, MmmMmm MmmMmm...

34:41.856 --> 34:44.693
I didn't think so,
all right, there we go.

34:44.726 --> 34:45.527
Too soon, bud.

34:45.560 --> 34:46.460
You know what?

34:46.494 --> 34:47.996
This is what we're gonna do.

34:48.030 --> 34:50.532
Everything in its right place.

34:51.866 --> 34:52.766
Yeah, yeah.

34:55.737 --> 34:57.139
Party on, Brad.

34:57.173 --> 34:58.640
There you go, you good?

34:58.673 --> 35:00.076
I'm good, I'm good.

35:01.944 --> 35:03.645
Watch it now.

35:03.678 --> 35:06.115
There you go, there you go.

35:07.749 --> 35:08.583
Dude.

35:10.052 --> 35:10.886
Oh.

35:14.223 --> 35:15.724
Did you know that
Ken Griffey Jr.

35:15.757 --> 35:18.027
hit 35 home runs last year?

35:19.061 --> 35:21.596
I did not know that.

35:21.629 --> 35:22.465
He did.

35:24.467 --> 35:28.304
Got it, god damn it,
I'm just trying to dude.

35:28.337 --> 35:32.008
What the fuck, dude, it's
fucking occupied, bro.

35:44.353 --> 35:46.255
Oh my god.

35:46.288 --> 35:48.958
Hey, you wanna tell everybody?

35:50.725 --> 35:51.559
Yo.

35:53.695 --> 35:55.797
Okay, well then I
will tell everyone.

35:55.830 --> 35:57.266
Okay, well, we...

35:57.299 --> 35:59.801
We're gonna be on
the fucking news, boys.

36:01.603 --> 36:02.505
Woo!

36:02.537 --> 36:03.339
We won?

36:03.372 --> 36:04.173
We fuckin' won?

36:07.276 --> 36:09.345
Let's go, yeah!

36:12.214 --> 36:12.982
Woo!

36:14.917 --> 36:16.118
All right, we should really
probably practice the song.

36:16.152 --> 36:16.952
Yeah.

36:23.059 --> 36:23.893
Oh dear.

36:25.693 --> 36:27.662
Oh, hi, you must Roberta.

36:27.695 --> 36:30.132
And you must be Steelo
and the Murderers.

36:30.166 --> 36:31.233
Yes ma'am.

36:31.267 --> 36:33.436
Okay, is this everybody?

36:33.469 --> 36:34.669
Hi guys.

36:34.702 --> 36:35.905
- Hi.
- What's up?

36:35.938 --> 36:37.373
There's also Kirk,
he's our lead singer,

36:37.406 --> 36:39.208
he's gonna hang back while
we get sound checked,

36:39.241 --> 36:42.044
he can be a little,
you know, the talent.

36:42.078 --> 36:45.580
Ah, the talent, oh yeah,
I know all about the talent.

36:45.613 --> 36:46.781
Well why don't
you guys follow me

36:46.815 --> 36:50.152
and we'll get you all
set up, all right?

36:51.087 --> 36:52.088
Righteous.

37:00.862 --> 37:01.763
Mom, Dad?

37:03.432 --> 37:05.767
Uncle Frank, is this a joke?

37:36.265 --> 37:39.101
Kirk, Kirk, what
the fuck, Kirk?

37:43.038 --> 37:43.939
Get up.

37:43.973 --> 37:45.341
What, ah!

37:45.374 --> 37:48.177
The guys are waiting for you.

37:48.210 --> 37:49.945
Did we already
play for the bad men?

37:51.779 --> 37:53.449
You took all of these?

37:53.482 --> 37:55.918
You are so fucked up,
get up, come on, up.

37:55.951 --> 37:56.751
Yeah, wait, wait...

37:56.784 --> 37:58.087
Put this on, up.

37:58.120 --> 37:59.654
Hold on,
gimme a blow job.

37:59.687 --> 38:00.589
- No!
- What do you mean?

38:00.623 --> 38:01.756
It's fine.

38:01.789 --> 38:03.691
- Kirk, Jesus.
- We have time.

38:16.671 --> 38:18.174
Holy shit.

38:18.207 --> 38:19.874
Oh, that's a look.

38:20.808 --> 38:21.610
All right.

38:21.644 --> 38:22.545
That's a cool j...

38:22.578 --> 38:24.647
So, how long until we're on?

38:24.679 --> 38:26.882
We go on soon.

38:26.916 --> 38:27.815
Did you
soundcheck and everything?

38:27.849 --> 38:29.185
Yo, you ready?

38:30.818 --> 38:32.288
Is he okay?

38:32.321 --> 38:33.155
Yes, he's fine,
if you got everything checked,

38:33.189 --> 38:34.657
he's fine, oh my god.

38:34.689 --> 38:37.692
Knock knock, oh,
you must be Kirk.

38:42.364 --> 38:43.731
He doesn't look okay.

38:43.765 --> 38:46.635
Roberta, he's fine, he's fine.

38:46.669 --> 38:48.836
I'm ready to roll mama.

38:48.870 --> 38:49.672
Oh my god.

38:49.704 --> 38:50.872
Okay, great.

38:52.141 --> 38:52.975
Last little thing is...

38:53.008 --> 38:53.841
Hoo!

38:55.044 --> 38:56.478
Okay, I need to tell
you about somethin',

38:56.512 --> 38:58.280
I don't know if y'all are aware,

38:58.314 --> 38:59.915
but there was a
shooting last night

38:59.949 --> 39:02.218
at the Bash's on 104th Street.

39:02.251 --> 39:03.785
Yeah, so we're
gonna run a segment

39:03.818 --> 39:05.020
right after your performance,

39:05.054 --> 39:07.022
because we have a bag boy

39:07.056 --> 39:09.558
who actually witness
the slaughter.

39:09.592 --> 39:11.026
So if you could do me a favor,

39:11.060 --> 39:15.364
and not say the word murder,
as in Murder Dogs, okay?

39:16.831 --> 39:19.168
That would be great, got it?

39:20.269 --> 39:21.637
Okay.

39:31.647 --> 39:34.550
How did you guys
feel about that one?

39:34.583 --> 39:36.784
Joey, don't rush the
click track, bro,

39:36.818 --> 39:39.221
I love the direction we're
goin' in with this song,

39:39.255 --> 39:40.923
fuckin', I'm jazzed.

39:40.956 --> 39:43.858
Let's take a soft
20 and come back.

39:47.263 --> 39:48.464
What do you have for daddy?

39:48.497 --> 39:50.099
Oh, I got some
treats for daddy.

39:50.132 --> 39:52.534
Ew, stop, bosses talk
dirty to their employees,

39:52.568 --> 39:53.768
not the other way around.

39:53.801 --> 39:54.937
I thought you
liked it that way.

39:54.970 --> 39:56.405
Shut your mouth, okay?

39:56.438 --> 39:58.307
It's Monday, what new
bands do you have for me?

39:58.340 --> 40:00.476
I got one that's pretty cool.

40:00.509 --> 40:01.877
What was with the pause?

40:01.910 --> 40:04.747
Well, it's unintentional,
I was just thinkin',

40:04.779 --> 40:06.615
it's this cool band, I
saw 'em over the weekend,

40:06.649 --> 40:08.751
I think you're gonna like it.

40:08.783 --> 40:12.187
They're playin' on the
TV, you wanna go see 'em?

40:12.221 --> 40:13.389
I got it queued up.

40:13.422 --> 40:14.590
They're
on TV right now?

40:14.623 --> 40:15.758
Yeah, yeah, it's
like this local thing,

40:15.790 --> 40:17.359
you should see
'em, they're local.

40:17.393 --> 40:18.294
Yeah, let's see it.

40:18.327 --> 40:19.395
All right.

40:19.428 --> 40:20.062
All right, bring
the TV in here.

40:20.095 --> 40:20.996
What?

40:21.030 --> 40:22.931
Just bring the TV in here.

40:22.965 --> 40:24.600
It's like 60 inches.

40:24.633 --> 40:26.402
Sorry, just bring it in here.

40:26.435 --> 40:28.637
Bring it in, bring it in.

40:28.671 --> 40:30.606
You want me to move it?

40:30.639 --> 40:31.607
It's like 200 pounds.

40:31.640 --> 40:33.409
I know you can do it.

40:33.442 --> 40:36.679
Okay, yeah, got
it, okay, here we go,

40:37.613 --> 40:38.514
if I can just...

40:38.547 --> 40:39.448
Where the fuck are you goin'?

40:39.481 --> 40:40.683
Where do you think you're goin'?

40:40.716 --> 40:42.184
Oh, sorry,
yeah, nope, right here...

40:42.217 --> 40:44.019
We're back with a little
segment we like to call

40:44.053 --> 40:45.654
Heat Up the AM,

40:45.688 --> 40:48.457
where every month we
feature a new band

40:48.490 --> 40:49.958
that's heatin'...

40:49.992 --> 40:50.793
You know, fun fact,
this isn't actually live...

40:50.825 --> 40:52.328
Shut your mouth.

40:52.361 --> 40:55.030
I am extremely excited
to introduce a band

40:55.064 --> 40:58.133
named Stylo and the
M Dogs, hi guys.

40:58.167 --> 41:00.369
We are Stylo and the M Dogs,

41:00.402 --> 41:03.871
and we're gonna
murder your shit.

41:05.207 --> 41:06.575
Cut!

41:06.608 --> 41:07.943
That lady's comin'.

41:07.976 --> 41:10.512
Guys, what did we talk about?

41:11.980 --> 41:16.051
I said don't say the word
murder, and the S word,

41:16.085 --> 41:17.519
that is a no-brainer.

41:17.553 --> 41:19.421
You can't say that on air.

41:19.455 --> 41:20.389
Roberta.

41:20.422 --> 41:21.623
Come on!

41:21.657 --> 41:22.857
He won't do it
again, I promise.

41:22.891 --> 41:23.692
You promise?

41:23.726 --> 41:25.294
I do, right Kirk?

41:26.495 --> 41:27.663
Kirk, right?

41:28.764 --> 41:31.166
Hey, you get one
more chance, all right?

41:31.200 --> 41:34.036
Or I'm gonna shut this down,
you're not gonna get to play.

41:34.069 --> 41:36.004
Do you understand?

41:36.038 --> 41:36.939
Okay, you promise?

41:36.972 --> 41:37.806
Yes.

41:39.208 --> 41:42.578
Ladies and gentlemen,
here's Stylo and the M Dogs,

41:42.611 --> 41:45.547

song "Deep Freeze,"

take it away, guys.

44:23.071 --> 44:24.806
don't leave a message,
just come get a drink.

44:35.952 --> 44:37.887
Hey, hey, I know you.

44:39.221 --> 44:40.389
Oh hey.

44:40.422 --> 44:43.191
- Hi.
- Hey, have we met before?

44:43.225 --> 44:46.361
Ha ha , I
would say come in,

44:46.395 --> 44:47.796
but we literally just closed.

44:47.829 --> 44:49.064
Oh no, really?

44:49.097 --> 44:50.566
I was just about to come in.

44:50.599 --> 44:51.800
I was just comin' in,

44:51.833 --> 44:53.569
and I was gonna see if
you were here, actually.

44:53.602 --> 44:55.905
Oh really, well
it's perfect timing,

44:55.939 --> 44:57.506
'cause I just got off.

44:57.539 --> 45:01.176
Oh nice, yeah, well I'm
gonna smoke a cigarette.

45:01.209 --> 45:03.245
Oh, you smoke now?

45:03.278 --> 45:05.147
Yeah, I grew up smoking.

45:05.180 --> 45:06.782
Oh, got it, okay.

45:12.321 --> 45:13.655
How was the news, by the way?

45:14.656 --> 45:15.791
Thank you.

45:15.824 --> 45:17.593
It was amazing,
, did you watch?

45:17.626 --> 45:18.995
I didn't, but Candice had

45:19.028 --> 45:20.529
six different
people recording it

45:20.562 --> 45:22.065
in all different place, so.

45:22.097 --> 45:22.899
Sounds about right.

45:22.932 --> 45:24.033
Yeah, yeah.

45:24.067 --> 45:25.233
As she should.

45:25.267 --> 45:26.435
Yeah, I'll be
sure to let you know

45:26.468 --> 45:27.937
what I think when I watch it.

45:27.971 --> 45:29.871
Yeah, well what if
you don't like it?

45:29.906 --> 45:31.340
What if you think we
suck or somethin'?

45:31.373 --> 45:33.108
Well then I would
have to tell you.

45:33.141 --> 45:35.677
Really, you'd just
shoot me that straight?

45:35.711 --> 45:36.845
Of course.

45:36.879 --> 45:37.713
Okay.

45:39.048 --> 45:40.984
Do you wanna go
hang out right now?

45:41.017 --> 45:43.019
Yeah, yeah, right now?

45:44.319 --> 45:45.153
Yeah.

45:45.187 --> 45:46.355
- Yeah.
- Okay.

45:49.491 --> 45:51.693
Welcome to my contingency van.

45:51.727 --> 45:52.561
Oh wow.

45:55.197 --> 45:56.231
Contingency van?

45:56.264 --> 45:58.433
Yes, for
apocalyptic scenarios,

45:58.467 --> 46:01.536
like zombie
infestation, contagion,

46:01.570 --> 46:04.406
extra-terrestrial
or chemical war.

46:05.273 --> 46:07.476
This van would serve as my home.

46:07.509 --> 46:08.945
Okay.

46:08.978 --> 46:12.381
It's also where I get
black-out drunk with my friends.

46:13.815 --> 46:14.850
Double okay.

47:09.038 --> 47:09.838
Evvy.

47:09.871 --> 47:12.108
Hey, Kirk Towns, yeah.

47:12.141 --> 47:13.575
Stylo and the Murder Dogs,
my friend, good to meet you.

47:13.608 --> 47:14.877
I'm Brad, nice to meet you.

47:14.911 --> 47:16.145
Mark.

47:16.179 --> 47:17.412
All right, stay
by me, all right?

47:17.446 --> 47:18.747
Right this way, okay,
come on, don't be shy.

47:25.922 --> 47:28.824
You guys want any
coffee, or booze?

47:31.160 --> 47:32.761
Oh yeah, I'll take some booze.

47:32.794 --> 47:35.898
Yeah, maybe a six
pack of Red Stripe?

47:35.932 --> 47:37.133
I'm down.

47:37.166 --> 47:39.068
Yeah, actually make
that two six packs.

47:39.102 --> 47:41.536
Spoken like a true drummer.

47:44.539 --> 47:45.507
How old are you?

47:45.540 --> 47:47.076
- He's 21.
- He's 21.

47:48.044 --> 47:48.878
21.

47:50.345 --> 47:51.180
Okay.

47:58.020 --> 47:59.222
- You whistled for me?
- Hey, Buddy, everybody,

47:59.254 --> 48:00.522
this is Buddy.

48:00.555 --> 48:01.356
My name's not Buddy.

48:01.389 --> 48:02.624
Hey Buddy.

48:02.657 --> 48:04.093
No one really gives a
fuck what your name is,

48:04.127 --> 48:06.528
you just need to bust you
butt down to the corner store,

48:06.561 --> 48:08.898
get these gentlemen
a 24 pack of PBR,

48:08.931 --> 48:10.332
you guys cool with PBR?

48:10.365 --> 48:11.167
Yeah.

48:11.200 --> 48:12.001
Kay, bye Buddy.

48:12.034 --> 48:12.935
Dust in the attic.

48:12.969 --> 48:14.703
Hey, do you have any cash?

48:14.736 --> 48:15.905
Where was I?

48:15.938 --> 48:16.906
Where was I?

48:16.939 --> 48:18.174
We were talkin' about

48:18.207 --> 48:19.942
you letting us record
our EP here, for free.

48:19.976 --> 48:22.544
Check out the
big brain on Brad.

48:22.577 --> 48:24.346
Bring out the gimp.

48:25.313 --> 48:26.115
That's from Pulp Fiction.

48:26.149 --> 48:27.616
Here's how I see it,

48:27.649 --> 48:30.987
Radiohead had "Creep,"
Beck had "Loser,"

48:32.354 --> 48:36.092
Stylo and the Murder
Dogs have "Deep Freeze."

48:37.492 --> 48:39.929
What's in it for you?

48:39.962 --> 48:41.030
Brad again.

48:42.798 --> 48:44.533
When you guys blow the fuck up,

48:44.566 --> 48:46.035
and it comes time to record

48:46.068 --> 48:50.572
that much anticipated full
length record, make it here.

48:52.474 --> 48:53.708
We don't need
to sign anything?

48:53.742 --> 48:54.843
Look, the truth is,

48:54.877 --> 48:56.078
you guys should really be

48:56.112 --> 48:57.479
signing a contract
with each other,

48:57.512 --> 48:59.182
I don't know if you know
anything about bands,

48:59.215 --> 49:02.417
but you motherfuckers
eat each other.

49:02.450 --> 49:03.920
So it doesn't have to
be anything complicated,

49:03.953 --> 49:07.156
somethin' simple, that says
who owns what, who does what...

49:07.190 --> 49:10.492
No, how 'bout
this, we'll just pay?

49:10.525 --> 49:11.459
Okay?

49:11.493 --> 49:12.561
I mean, if you insist...

49:12.594 --> 49:13.795
I insist, dude...

49:13.829 --> 49:14.830
Hey dude, why
don't we just take

49:14.863 --> 49:16.631
this nice man up on his offer,

49:16.665 --> 49:18.034
and we'll come back and
record our full length...

49:18.067 --> 49:19.367
- No, you don't get it...
- If we want to.

49:19.401 --> 49:21.003
He's not even
gonna make us stay.

49:21.037 --> 49:23.206
No, fuck that, dude, no.

49:23.239 --> 49:24.506
Okay, could we have a second?

49:24.539 --> 49:26.042
Sure.

49:26.075 --> 49:28.110
No no, nope, nope, I don't,
no no, I don't need a second,

49:28.144 --> 49:29.578
I don't need a second,

49:29.611 --> 49:33.448
because I wanna pay this
man for his time, all right?

49:33.481 --> 49:34.516
No strings attached.

49:34.549 --> 49:35.985
No strings, look,

49:36.018 --> 49:38.486
if you don't wanna make your
first record here, that's fine.

49:38.520 --> 49:41.290
But I'm telling you, once
you hear those songs,

49:41.324 --> 49:43.792
your songs on that
fuckin' tape machine,

49:43.825 --> 49:45.460
you're gonna be
circling back here

49:45.493 --> 49:49.031
like a suckling pig
to its mother's tit.

49:49.065 --> 49:52.235
Listen, baby, I
know the game, okay?

49:53.668 --> 49:56.638
But I'd rather pay for my milk.

49:56.671 --> 49:57.873
Dude.

49:57.907 --> 49:58.673
No, I'd rather
pay for the milk.

49:58.707 --> 49:59.608
Just sit down...

49:59.641 --> 50:00.709
I'd rather pay for the milk.

50:00.742 --> 50:01.643
- Come on.
- Pay for the milk?

50:01.676 --> 50:02.577
It's okay.

50:02.611 --> 50:03.946
Look, let's go talk to him.

50:03.980 --> 50:05.181
- Fuck that.
- We'll be right back.

50:05.214 --> 50:06.514
Dude, you
don't get hurt.

50:07.350 --> 50:08.516
I don't understand,

50:08.550 --> 50:10.219
why don't we just
record with that guy?

50:10.253 --> 50:11.988
Yeah, where are we
gonna get the money, Kirk?

50:12.021 --> 50:13.421
Yeah man, unless you
got some rich uncle

50:13.455 --> 50:14.689
that we don't know about,

50:14.723 --> 50:16.491
I suggest you step
off the Kirk express,

50:16.524 --> 50:18.227
and we record some
fucking songs, man.

50:18.261 --> 50:19.761
Do you ever fucking think

50:19.794 --> 50:23.232
that it's not about
the god damned money.

50:24.499 --> 50:26.135
Hey, how'd it go?

50:26.168 --> 50:27.904
What the fuck, what happened?

50:27.937 --> 50:30.940
What, I leave for two
seconds, this is what happens?

50:30.973 --> 50:32.174
No, the guy in
there is awesome,

50:32.208 --> 50:33.675
and he wants to record us.

50:33.708 --> 50:36.045
For free, just wants us to
record a full length with him

50:36.078 --> 50:37.846
if we like the
way the EP sounds.

50:37.880 --> 50:40.049
And not even make
us sign anything.

50:40.082 --> 50:41.616
Okay, well what did Kirk say?

50:41.650 --> 50:43.052
Nothing, he was just like...

50:43.085 --> 50:45.187
You fuckin'
shits talkin' shit on me?

50:45.221 --> 50:46.421
No.

50:46.454 --> 50:48.224
Babe, you wanna
talk to us, or?

50:48.257 --> 50:50.993
This guy
stinks of high treason.

50:51.027 --> 50:52.494
How?

50:52.527 --> 50:55.664
The first thing he
brings up is a fucking contract.

50:55.697 --> 50:58.935
We're a family, what more
of a contract is there?

50:58.968 --> 51:02.737
Dude, how long have
you known me, bro?

51:02.771 --> 51:04.907
Uh, eight years.

51:04.941 --> 51:07.575
10 whole years, man, 10 years.

51:09.178 --> 51:10.712
We're family.

51:10.745 --> 51:13.615
I want you to hear me say it
now, you can trust me, okay?

51:13.648 --> 51:15.051
You can trust me.

51:17.920 --> 51:19.922
Quack, quack, quack,

51:19.956 --> 51:23.092
Quack, quack, quack,
quack, quack, quack, quack,

51:23.125 --> 51:27.096
quack, quack, quack, quack,
quack, quack, quack, quack!

51:27.129 --> 51:28.164
Can we go, please?

51:28.197 --> 51:29.031
Yep.

51:33.402 --> 51:35.304
Oh shit, nice.

51:37.739 --> 51:38.573
Oh yeah.

51:39.708 --> 51:42.078
You guys feel that hot hot heat?

51:42.111 --> 51:43.478
Yeah, it's a little hot.

51:43.511 --> 51:44.981
Who wants to try?

51:45.014 --> 51:46.282
- I'll go.
- I'll go.

51:46.315 --> 51:47.582
You go.

51:47.615 --> 51:48.384
- Are you sure?
- That's the spirit.

51:48.417 --> 51:49.118
I'll go after you.

51:49.151 --> 51:50.152
All right.

51:51.686 --> 51:55.857
So Kirk tells me you guys
played on the news, huh?

51:55.891 --> 51:57.859
- Yup.
- Yes.

52:02.497 --> 52:03.966
Fuck.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.701
What's wrong, you've never
seen a factory pre-roll before?

52:06.735 --> 52:07.836
What's a factory pre-roll?

52:07.869 --> 52:09.071
Come on Kirk!

52:11.907 --> 52:13.109
I get these pre-rolled joints

52:13.142 --> 52:14.410
from an old fuck
buddy in the LBC.

52:14.443 --> 52:17.545
Ooh, yeah, sorry, I
promised the Mrs., yeah,

52:17.579 --> 52:18.847
but it was my decision, too.

52:18.881 --> 52:20.282
Are you guys all married?

52:20.316 --> 52:23.119
Just Mark, I'll
hit that, thank you.

52:23.152 --> 52:25.187
We talked about
it together, so.

52:26.055 --> 52:27.223
Ah, yes!

52:27.256 --> 52:28.891
I gotta get this,
go for Everett.

52:28.924 --> 52:30.126
Hey Albert, can I hit that?

52:30.159 --> 52:30.993
Yeah.

52:32.395 --> 52:33.661
Come on Kirk.

52:34.829 --> 52:36.499
Hey, can I
touch your balls, bro?

52:36.531 --> 52:38.034
Fuck
outta here, go, go!

52:38.067 --> 52:41.569
Touch your balls,
ow, fuck, you hurt my arm!

52:41.603 --> 52:44.040
Hey hey, so how
much we talkin' here?

52:44.073 --> 52:47.575
Fuck, I'm thinkin'
5,000 for the record,

52:48.710 --> 52:50.312
10,000 for the video,

52:50.346 --> 52:53.516
and maybe another
5,000 for the merch?

52:54.816 --> 52:56.318
What'd he say?

52:56.352 --> 52:58.287
I don't know, man, that
sounds like way too much.

52:58.320 --> 53:00.555
Yeah, I feel like
10's probably fine.

53:00.588 --> 53:01.490
10 it is.

53:04.193 --> 53:05.161
Okay then.

53:07.997 --> 53:09.198
Dude, you and the
fuckin' new guy...

53:09.231 --> 53:10.399
Chill out, dude!

53:10.433 --> 53:11.367
Fucked up my
negotiation tactics!

53:11.400 --> 53:12.867
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

53:12.902 --> 53:13.868
Oh, your fuckin'
negotiation tactics, huh?

53:13.903 --> 53:15.438
New guy?

53:15.471 --> 53:18.007
I couldn't hear
shit ridin' bitch.

53:18.040 --> 53:19.874
We had 20 Gs, Stibe.

53:20.876 --> 53:22.878
He was gonna give us 20 Gs,

53:22.912 --> 53:24.579
and then you needle dick bitches

53:24.612 --> 53:27.950
fuckin' undercut my
position, dude, undercut me.

53:27.983 --> 53:29.919
Okay, we undercut
your position.

53:29.952 --> 53:31.820
All I'm saying is,

53:31.853 --> 53:35.424
do you really think we need
to borrow 20 thousand dollars?

53:35.458 --> 53:38.561
You don't know what
I'm conjuring, dude.

53:38.593 --> 53:40.262
- Kirk.
- You don't know.

53:40.296 --> 53:41.263
At the end of the day,

53:41.297 --> 53:42.531
the more money we borrow,

53:42.565 --> 53:44.567
the more money we
have to pay back.

53:44.599 --> 53:46.801
We don't even have
an EP worth of songs.

53:46.835 --> 53:49.637
Dude, I have millions
of songs, dude,

53:49.671 --> 53:51.673
in my head, what are
you talking about?

53:51.706 --> 53:53.576
I'm not doubting you, okay?

53:53.608 --> 53:54.977
Did it seem like I
was doubting him?

53:55.010 --> 53:56.711
Because I'm not.

53:56.744 --> 53:58.646
By the way, Mark,
you're out of the band.

53:58.680 --> 53:59.882
- Whoa.
- What, dude.

53:59.915 --> 54:01.816
What the actual
fuck did I even do?

54:01.850 --> 54:03.018
Dude, you can't just

54:03.052 --> 54:04.520
oh I forgot someone out
of the fucking band,

54:04.553 --> 54:05.753
this isn't China.

54:05.787 --> 54:06.956
Is this another
round of tests?

54:06.989 --> 54:09.824
Dude, it's not up to me.

54:09.858 --> 54:11.793
Yes it is!

54:16.098 --> 54:17.099
Hang back.

54:26.741 --> 54:28.177
What's the key's guy's name?

54:28.210 --> 54:29.677
Oh, that's Mark.

54:29.711 --> 54:33.315
His energy fuckin'
blows, get rid of him.

54:34.583 --> 54:35.817
Really?

54:35.850 --> 54:37.719
No married dudes,
that's not the vibe.

54:37.752 --> 54:40.289
He's got the worst
stylistic identity, man.

54:40.322 --> 54:43.559
Yeah, yeah, then
who shall play keys?

54:45.528 --> 54:48.597
I got the perfect
guy, Horus Slays.

54:52.501 --> 54:55.337
I mean, yeah, you gotta pay his
day rate and all that stuff,

54:55.371 --> 54:57.606
but the music industry
is do or die, man.

54:57.640 --> 54:58.806
Yeah.

54:59.707 --> 55:00.943
Look at Mark,

55:00.976 --> 55:03.845
looks like a fuckin'
homeless hillbilly,

55:03.879 --> 55:07.116
chained down by
faux marital bliss.

55:07.149 --> 55:08.584
Yeah, I could see that.

55:08.617 --> 55:10.986
It's in my eye,
oh god, oh god.

55:11.020 --> 55:12.421
Did I ever tell you

55:12.454 --> 55:14.789
what the manager for
Linkin Park once told me?

55:14.822 --> 55:16.225
I don't know.

55:16.258 --> 55:20.062
He said a rockstar is
someone that girls wanna fuck,

55:20.095 --> 55:22.498
and the dudes wanna be.

55:22.531 --> 55:26.335
And before Stylo and the
Murder Dogs blows the fuck up,

55:26.368 --> 55:27.570
you need to keep

55:27.603 --> 55:29.538
all those music rights
to yourself, all right?

55:29.572 --> 55:31.373
Have all these
greasy bums out here

55:31.407 --> 55:34.376
sign NDAs and non-competes.

55:34.410 --> 55:36.245
And if any of them
give you any guff,

55:36.278 --> 55:37.980
you just replace 'em,

55:38.013 --> 55:42.218
with guys just like Horus
motherfuckin' Slays.

55:42.251 --> 55:44.320
A band full of
keyboard players, man, that's...

55:44.353 --> 55:47.456
No, no, independent
contractors.

55:47.489 --> 55:48.756
Right, right.

55:50.159 --> 55:51.759
And you came up with the name?

55:51.793 --> 55:53.362
Yeah, well me and Candice.

55:53.395 --> 55:55.297
Not a question.

55:55.331 --> 55:56.599
Right, right.

55:58.267 --> 56:00.102
He wants me out of the band?

56:00.135 --> 56:01.604
The hell's
wrong with you, man?

56:01.637 --> 56:03.372
It's just business.

56:03.405 --> 56:05.374
Why do we need
this golfer prick?

56:05.407 --> 56:07.443
Producer guy's offering
to do it for free.

56:07.476 --> 56:08.944
Yeah, I thought we didn't
care about the money.

56:08.978 --> 56:10.812
I don't care about
the money, dude,

56:10.845 --> 56:13.515
I have a bigger
picture for this band.

56:13.549 --> 56:14.984
Do you not get that?

56:15.017 --> 56:18.020
I'm talkin' merch,
I'm talkin' videos,

56:18.053 --> 56:21.323
international tours, cool
art projects, whatever...

56:21.357 --> 56:23.825
Kirk, we get that, but what
happens when a label's like

56:23.858 --> 56:26.528
"Drop the band," then what?

56:26.562 --> 56:28.364
He doesn't even
wanna be in the band.

56:28.397 --> 56:29.198
Yes I do...

56:29.231 --> 56:30.032
Admit it!

56:30.065 --> 56:31.467
Yes I do, I do.

56:32.601 --> 56:35.604
News flash, you're
married, Shtibe.

56:35.638 --> 56:38.173
You're probably already
thinking about leaving the band.

56:38.207 --> 56:40.209
Are you fuckin'
marriage shaming me, bro?

56:40.242 --> 56:42.911
Yeah, I'm fuckin'
marriage shaming you, dude,

56:42.945 --> 56:45.180
Rachel, think about Rachel.

56:46.382 --> 56:49.784
So you really think that
Rachel's just hunky dory

56:49.817 --> 56:52.421
with you goin' out on
tour with the boys,

56:52.454 --> 56:56.191
and smashin' beers, and
she's just chillin at home,

56:56.225 --> 56:59.161
sitting at a dining table all
by herself, eating a meal,

56:59.194 --> 56:59.995
and when she's like

57:00.029 --> 57:02.398
"Oh, where's Shtibe?"

57:02.431 --> 57:03.831
Yeah, sounds fun.

57:06.335 --> 57:08.270
I knew it dude, I know.

57:09.238 --> 57:10.072
Mark?

57:12.341 --> 57:14.043
What, it maybe'd
crossed my mind.

57:14.076 --> 57:15.411
- Oh my gosh, dude.
- Mark.

57:15.444 --> 57:16.645
What?

57:16.679 --> 57:18.514
I thought she would
come around, you know,

57:18.547 --> 57:20.015
when she heard how good we are.

57:20.049 --> 57:22.151
She hasn't come around?

57:23.552 --> 57:26.255
It's been really hard to
get her to come around lately.

57:26.288 --> 57:29.124
All right, well my vote is,

57:29.158 --> 57:30.626
if Mark could give us his word

57:30.659 --> 57:32.361
that he's gonna be committed
to trying new techniques

57:32.394 --> 57:34.563
to get her to come around,

57:35.764 --> 57:37.299
then fuck golfer prick,
we don't need his money,

57:37.333 --> 57:38.767
let's record for free
with producer guy.

57:38.801 --> 57:41.203
No no no, no dude, you're
not thinking big enough,

57:41.236 --> 57:42.538
you're not thinking big enough.

57:42.571 --> 57:44.573
No, I agree with Brad.

57:46.075 --> 57:48.177
Fine, if he can commit.

57:49.712 --> 57:51.180
Fine.

57:51.213 --> 57:55.351
Mark, can you eternally
commit to being a Murder Dog,

57:55.384 --> 57:59.888
and nothing but a fucking
Murder Dog, so help you God?

58:02.324 --> 58:03.125
Kirk's right!

58:03.158 --> 58:04.259
Oh my god.

58:04.293 --> 58:05.494
- I knew it!
- Come on, man!

58:05.527 --> 58:08.397
I can only commit
to one thing, Rachel.

58:08.430 --> 58:09.598
- Mark.
- Mark.

58:11.767 --> 58:13.369
But you know what?

58:14.703 --> 58:19.041
I would be honored to be
replaced by Horus fucking Slays.

58:19.908 --> 58:21.577
You know Horus Slays?

58:21.610 --> 58:25.247
Yeah, he used to play with
the Master Baits, constantly.

58:25.280 --> 58:27.049
Whoa, that's tight.

58:30.219 --> 58:31.019
We love you, man.

58:31.053 --> 58:32.554
I love you guys.

58:32.588 --> 58:33.756
Come here, man.

58:33.789 --> 58:36.392
We love
you, Shtibe, I mean.

58:36.425 --> 58:39.561
I mean, you're doing
the right thing, Stibe.

58:39.595 --> 58:40.729
I know.

58:40.763 --> 58:41.497
You're doin'
the right thing.

58:41.530 --> 58:42.698
I know I am.

59:07.823 --> 59:10.859
Sky, Kirk
has to be in the middle.

59:13.629 --> 59:15.964
Sorry, who the fuck are you?

59:15.998 --> 59:17.466
My name is
Horus, Horus Slays.

59:17.499 --> 59:18.934
Oh, right, right.

59:18.967 --> 59:20.135
Lookin' for
Stylo and the Murder Dogs.

59:20.169 --> 59:21.870
Yeah, guys,
this is Horus Slays.

59:21.905 --> 59:23.105
Oh, what's goin' on man?

59:23.138 --> 59:25.007
The boys, Stylo
and the Murder Dogs.

59:25.040 --> 59:25.841
Albert.

59:25.874 --> 59:26.775
Horus Slays.

59:26.809 --> 59:27.709
Let's get you in an outfit,

59:27.743 --> 59:29.044
thank you so much for coming.

59:54.136 --> 59:57.840
All right,
hey, let's focus, okay.

59:57.873 --> 59:58.807
No, no, no.

01:00:01.376 --> 01:00:03.312
- Oh!
- Yeah, that one.

01:00:03.345 --> 01:00:04.179
Oh yeah!

01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:06.815
No.

01:00:06.849 --> 01:00:07.749
Oh shit.

01:00:07.783 --> 01:00:09.151
Yes, this is it, this is it.

01:00:09.184 --> 01:00:10.686
That's iconic, dude.

01:00:10.719 --> 01:00:13.355
That's gorgeous.

01:00:13.388 --> 01:00:15.357
Hi, I just need to do a
couple things differently...

01:00:15.390 --> 01:00:16.592
Hi.

01:00:16.625 --> 01:00:18.560
Yeah, and I think
this is the take.

01:00:18.594 --> 01:00:19.394
I think so too.

01:00:19.428 --> 01:00:20.229
Yeah, you do?

01:00:20.262 --> 01:00:21.497
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:22.899
Fuck yes, I mean,
even if you didn't,

01:00:22.932 --> 01:00:24.333
I would still say this one.

01:00:24.366 --> 01:00:25.167
I know you would.

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.001
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:00:26.034 --> 01:00:26.835
Okay.

01:00:46.522 --> 01:00:47.656
- Yo.
- Yo.

01:00:47.689 --> 01:00:50.092
Shot
town, to you, boys!

01:00:53.228 --> 01:00:54.596
Oh, tees, tees!

01:00:55.797 --> 01:00:57.633
Oh, check this.

01:00:57.666 --> 01:00:58.867
What?

01:00:58.902 --> 01:01:00.369
Baby lemme see,
lemme see, lemme see!

01:01:00.402 --> 01:01:02.271
Oh, those are fucking great.

01:01:14.349 --> 01:01:17.519
Well, if you haven't
been, we should go tomorrow.

01:01:17.553 --> 01:01:21.156
We should, but I can't tomorrow
night, can you do lunch?

01:01:21.189 --> 01:01:23.625
Oh, we can't, we're
meeting with this A&R guy.

01:01:23.659 --> 01:01:24.860
Really?

01:01:24.894 --> 01:01:25.594
Yeah, Kirk's showin'
him some more songs.

01:01:25.627 --> 01:01:27.062
That's epic.

01:01:27.095 --> 01:01:28.330
You have to knock on wood now.

01:01:28.363 --> 01:01:29.865
What do you mean?

01:01:29.899 --> 01:01:31.600
When you say the E word
you have to knock on wood.

01:01:31.633 --> 01:01:32.801
What, epic?

01:01:32.834 --> 01:01:34.336
Now you have to knock twice.

01:01:34.369 --> 01:01:35.571
Okay.

01:01:44.446 --> 01:01:45.347
Ignore them.

01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:46.148
What are they doing?

01:01:46.181 --> 01:01:46.916
Please ignore them.

01:01:46.950 --> 01:01:47.749
Oh my god.

01:01:47.783 --> 01:01:48.985
They're being dumb.

01:01:49.018 --> 01:01:50.452
Well what about the night after?

01:01:50.485 --> 01:01:53.722
Um, actually, my parents
are coming into town,

01:01:53.755 --> 01:01:57.225
so I have to play tourist
with them for a little bit.

01:01:57.259 --> 01:01:59.461
I should meet them.

01:01:59.494 --> 01:02:00.629
Right?

01:02:00.662 --> 01:02:01.530
Um.

01:02:01.563 --> 01:02:02.764
Maybe not?

01:02:02.798 --> 01:02:04.067
Did I just make it weird?

01:02:04.099 --> 01:02:06.234
No, I just, I mean,
isn't it a little fast

01:02:06.268 --> 01:02:07.369
to meet my parents?

01:02:07.402 --> 01:02:08.938
Yeah, absolutely, sorry.

01:02:08.972 --> 01:02:11.941
No, I mean, you can
meet them if you want to.

01:02:11.975 --> 01:02:12.874
Really?

01:02:12.909 --> 01:02:14.676
They're actually really great.

01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:17.312
So it would be weird,
or it wouldn't be weird?

01:02:17.346 --> 01:02:19.514
Fuck it, it's not weird.

01:02:37.799 --> 01:02:39.601
So how many songs
have you tracked so far?

01:02:39.635 --> 01:02:40.435
Three so far.

01:02:40.469 --> 01:02:41.536
Three songs?

01:02:41.570 --> 01:02:43.072
Nice.

01:02:43.106 --> 01:02:44.073
First time
in the history of mankind

01:02:44.107 --> 01:02:46.174
that a band shows up before me.

01:02:46.208 --> 01:02:47.977
There he is.

01:02:48.011 --> 01:02:50.445
There he is, there he is,

01:02:50.479 --> 01:02:53.649
you look like Avril
fuckin' Lavine.

01:02:53.682 --> 01:02:57.252
Well you look like
my gay fuckin' uncle.

01:02:59.022 --> 01:03:00.489
Good to see you, Jordan.

01:03:00.522 --> 01:03:01.723
I was tellin' your boys,

01:03:01.757 --> 01:03:03.492
I'm actually through
on my way to South By.

01:03:03.525 --> 01:03:04.826
Is this
February already?

01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:05.928
I go
out early, you know?

01:03:05.962 --> 01:03:07.130
Calm before the storm.

01:03:07.162 --> 01:03:08.296
Yeah, yeah, takin'
the airstream?

01:03:08.330 --> 01:03:09.132
Hell yeah.

01:03:09.164 --> 01:03:09.966
Yeah.

01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:12.969
So we gonna hear some music?

01:03:13.002 --> 01:03:14.070
Yeah, are we
gonna hear some music?

01:03:14.103 --> 01:03:15.938
Yeah, yeah.

01:03:15.972 --> 01:03:17.073
Cool.

01:03:17.106 --> 01:03:19.909
Yeah, oh yeah, where's Kirk?

01:03:19.942 --> 01:03:21.944
He's on his way, yeah.

01:03:23.112 --> 01:03:24.881
I'm sorry, I gotta
take this, excuse me.

01:03:24.914 --> 01:03:28.583
- Oh yeah, yeah...
- I'll be back, guys, yeah?

01:03:31.186 --> 01:03:34.090
What the god damned
hell is goin' on here?

01:03:34.123 --> 01:03:35.124
We lost Kirk.

01:03:35.158 --> 01:03:36.059
You lost Kirk?

01:03:36.092 --> 01:03:37.592
Like a little kid in the mall?

01:03:37.626 --> 01:03:38.794
Go find him.

01:03:38.827 --> 01:03:40.262
We've been trying
to call Candice,

01:03:40.295 --> 01:03:41.763
but she's not answering,
and my phone's about to die.

01:03:41.797 --> 01:03:43.532
Yeah, I mean, why can't
we just send this guy an MP3

01:03:43.565 --> 01:03:44.366
when we find Kirk?

01:03:44.399 --> 01:03:45.567
I mean, what's the rush?

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:46.936
Phone's about to
die, what's the rush?

01:03:46.969 --> 01:03:48.737
What are you talkin'?

01:03:50.439 --> 01:03:55.178
South by Southwest is the
biggest festival in the world

01:03:55.210 --> 01:03:57.813
for unsigned bands,
we want this guy

01:03:57.846 --> 01:04:00.149
to sign the Murder Dogs,

01:04:00.183 --> 01:04:03.618
no matter what
other bands he sees.

01:04:03.652 --> 01:04:06.421
Yeah, we know
what South By is.

01:04:07.823 --> 01:04:11.493
Listen baby, y'all gotta
chill out on all this stress,

01:04:11.526 --> 01:04:13.695
there's more than
one fuckin' A&R guy.

01:04:13.729 --> 01:04:16.165
Kirk just does
this shit sometimes,

01:04:16.199 --> 01:04:18.067
it's really not a big deal,
we'll get the next one.

01:04:18.101 --> 01:04:19.634
You guys are
killin' me, all right?

01:04:19.668 --> 01:04:21.303
What are you talkin' about?

01:04:21.336 --> 01:04:22.671
How old are you?

01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:24.974
Tell me, I wanna hear
it, how old are you?

01:04:25.007 --> 01:04:26.575
I'm 22.

01:04:26.608 --> 01:04:27.609
- 22.
- Yeah.

01:04:29.045 --> 01:04:30.445
Well you're gonna learn
really quickly in life,

01:04:30.479 --> 01:04:33.149
there's no guarantee there's
gonna be a next time.

01:04:33.182 --> 01:04:37.120
When you get a shot at somethin',
like you got right now,

01:04:37.153 --> 01:04:39.254
you gotta make it happen.

01:04:42.091 --> 01:04:43.525
We'll find him.

01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:45.895
We'll find him.

01:04:45.928 --> 01:04:46.762
Yeah.

01:04:47.930 --> 01:04:48.898
Guys, let's go, why
are we sitting here?

01:04:48.931 --> 01:04:49.731
Let's go find him.

01:04:49.765 --> 01:04:51.200
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:04:51.234 --> 01:04:52.235
He's probably fucked up
somewhere random or some shit,

01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:53.735
so we'll split up.

01:04:53.769 --> 01:04:56.105
Look, check yourself, Kirk
paid me through the week,

01:04:56.139 --> 01:04:58.207
so technically I'm
yours until 11 PM,

01:04:58.241 --> 01:04:59.307
so I'll help out.

01:04:59.341 --> 01:05:00.542
Great.

01:05:00.575 --> 01:05:02.078
Now we're fucked.

01:05:02.111 --> 01:05:02.879
I gotta run home
and get my phone charger.

01:05:02.912 --> 01:05:03.678
Find that kid, man.

01:05:03.712 --> 01:05:04.914
Godspeed.

01:05:04.947 --> 01:05:06.249
All right, I'm gonna
try to buy us some time.

01:05:06.281 --> 01:05:07.984
Listen to me,
Kirk's goin' through

01:05:08.017 --> 01:05:11.853
some super fucked up incestuous
family emergency right now.

01:05:11.888 --> 01:05:13.355
Oh no, incestuous?

01:05:13.388 --> 01:05:15.557
He's really stepping up, I'm
proud to call him my friend.

01:05:15.590 --> 01:05:16.993
I'd share the details with you,

01:05:17.026 --> 01:05:19.494
but he's asked us to
keep it confidential.

01:05:19.528 --> 01:05:22.031
Yeah, I understand,
that's terrible.

01:05:22.064 --> 01:05:25.001
If you could stick
around through the weekend.

01:05:25.034 --> 01:05:27.602
The weekend, I
don't think I can.

01:05:27.636 --> 01:05:29.805
You have 'til
technically Thursday.

01:05:29.838 --> 01:05:31.908
Bro, just send
me the fuckin' MP3s

01:05:31.941 --> 01:05:33.209
once they track more tunes.

01:05:33.242 --> 01:05:34.376
I'm not sayin' no.

01:05:34.409 --> 01:05:35.677
All right, all
right, I'm just sayin,

01:05:35.710 --> 01:05:37.914
we both know you're gonna be

01:05:37.947 --> 01:05:39.648
seein' a whole
fuck load of bands,

01:05:39.681 --> 01:05:41.184
if you stick around
through the weekend,

01:05:41.217 --> 01:05:42.617
I'll cut you Kirk's songs,

01:05:42.651 --> 01:05:44.120
you could listen to
them on the road trip.

01:05:44.153 --> 01:05:46.454
By the time you're
rolling into Austin,

01:05:46.488 --> 01:05:48.224
you're gonna have one
group on your mind,

01:05:48.257 --> 01:05:51.093
Stylo and the
fuckin' Murder Dogs.

01:05:52.261 --> 01:05:53.829
My pops would love if
I stayed the weekend.

01:05:53.862 --> 01:05:56.531
Exactly, exactly, you
look out for your family,

01:05:56.565 --> 01:05:59.135
Kirk looks out for his family.

01:05:59.168 --> 01:06:00.569
All right, you got it Jordan.

01:06:00.602 --> 01:06:02.504
All right Chad,
all right, man.

01:06:08.244 --> 01:06:10.412
This girl
was so fucking ugly,

01:06:10.445 --> 01:06:12.347
and I'm hearin'

01:06:17.954 --> 01:06:18.888
What the fuck is your problem?

01:06:18.921 --> 01:06:19.821
Fuck you!

01:06:20.957 --> 01:06:22.390
Oh, you fucker!

01:06:23.692 --> 01:06:25.527
No, fuck you!

01:06:27.429 --> 01:06:28.898
Hi hon.

01:06:28.931 --> 01:06:30.365
Shit's hit the fan.

01:06:30.398 --> 01:06:32.134
Sorry.

01:06:32.168 --> 01:06:35.537
Kirk's been missing,
my phone's about to die.

01:06:35.570 --> 01:06:37.039
Are you gonna eat here?

01:06:37.073 --> 01:06:41.177
MmmMmm, I'm not gonna
be home until I find him,

01:06:41.210 --> 01:06:42.011
you all right?

01:06:42.044 --> 01:06:42.844
Yeah, I'm good.

01:06:42.879 --> 01:06:43.778
Okay.

01:06:43.812 --> 01:06:45.214
Make sure you get food.

01:06:53.722 --> 01:06:58.261
Hey mom, have
you seen my phone charger?

01:06:58.294 --> 01:06:59.494
It was on my bedside table.

01:06:59.527 --> 01:07:01.796
I don't know, sweetheart.

01:07:11.073 --> 01:07:12.540
Oh shit.

01:07:14.143 --> 01:07:15.211
Mom, are you okay?

01:07:15.244 --> 01:07:16.645
- No.
- Mom!

01:07:17.579 --> 01:07:18.981
Mom, what happened?

01:07:19.015 --> 01:07:21.183
Okay, I just need
to get on the ground.

01:07:21.217 --> 01:07:23.986
Kay, go slow,
go slow, go slow.

01:07:27.290 --> 01:07:28.991
Hey, which hospital?

01:07:29.025 --> 01:07:30.192
St. Luke's on Mill.

01:07:30.226 --> 01:07:32.794
All right, I'm followin' you.

01:08:10.032 --> 01:08:10.865
No way.

01:08:12.101 --> 01:08:13.235
Kirk!

01:08:14.203 --> 01:08:15.137
Dude, what the fuck?

01:08:15.171 --> 01:08:17.471
Dude, Kirk, where have you been?

01:08:20.508 --> 01:08:22.211
Where the fuck have you been?

01:08:22.243 --> 01:08:23.578
Get in the car, get in!

01:08:24.845 --> 01:08:26.048
Put this down, what is that?

01:08:26.082 --> 01:08:27.149
Why the fuck are
you at a hospital?

01:08:43.198 --> 01:08:45.334
God damn it, Kirk!

01:08:45.368 --> 01:08:46.533
What the fuck?

01:08:48.703 --> 01:08:51.107
Get ahold of
yourself, man, fuck!

01:10:26.435 --> 01:10:30.306
So the deal is, Kirk
and Candice broke up.

01:10:30.339 --> 01:10:31.840
Full blown Yoko.

01:10:32.908 --> 01:10:34.110
Yoko?

01:10:34.143 --> 01:10:35.945
It means we're fucked.

01:10:35.978 --> 01:10:38.813
Candice was his
first real girlfriend.

01:10:38.847 --> 01:10:41.917
Oh, and all the songs were
about her, I just realized that.

01:10:41.951 --> 01:10:45.554
That makes sense, why all
these songs are so fuckin' good.

01:10:45.588 --> 01:10:47.822
They're precious to him.

01:10:47.856 --> 01:10:50.226
Hey man, it's past 11, we
can't afford to keep payin' you.

01:10:50.259 --> 01:10:51.826
No, you know what?

01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:53.996
I already put a lot of time
and energy I can't get back,

01:10:54.029 --> 01:10:58.934
so I'm already emotionally
invested up in this bitch.

01:10:58.968 --> 01:11:00.768
If you don't mind me askin',

01:11:00.802 --> 01:11:02.304
how long were they together?

01:11:02.338 --> 01:11:04.739
Three years, she
took his virginity.

01:11:04.772 --> 01:11:06.242
In Silver Lake.

01:11:06.275 --> 01:11:09.445
Wait, Kirk lost his
virginity three years ago?

01:11:09.478 --> 01:11:11.180
Isn't he in his 20s?

01:11:11.213 --> 01:11:14.350
Oh my god, you
guys, why did you care

01:11:17.953 --> 01:11:19.754
when people lose
their virginity?

01:11:19.787 --> 01:11:22.024
I mean, it's not true, okay,

01:11:22.057 --> 01:11:22.958
if you don't use
it, you lose it...

01:11:22.992 --> 01:11:25.294
Hey, hey hey hey, ho, hey,

01:11:26.395 --> 01:11:28.330
of the recent revelations,

01:11:28.364 --> 01:11:32.134
your being a virgin is
the least interesting,

01:11:33.068 --> 01:11:35.703
and the most predictable.

01:11:35.737 --> 01:11:39.575
Now run along, like
a good little virgin,

01:11:39.608 --> 01:11:42.611
and get the adults
some hard liquor.

01:11:45.414 --> 01:11:47.016
It's gonna be an all nighter.

01:11:47.049 --> 01:11:47.950
Stops!

01:11:47.983 --> 01:11:48.750
Well I'm not...

01:11:48.783 --> 01:11:50.286
Get the fuck out!

01:11:52.354 --> 01:11:54.490
Somebody need to get that
little munchkin a prostitute.

01:11:55.757 --> 01:11:57.792
I got the A&R guy
to postpone his trip.

01:11:57.825 --> 01:11:58.961
Oh, awesome.

01:12:01.664 --> 01:12:03.765
Do we know who
broke up with who?

01:12:03.798 --> 01:12:05.034
He said she left him

01:12:05.067 --> 01:12:08.736
for some rich golfer
guy, or somethin'?

01:12:08.770 --> 01:12:10.705
Golfer prick?

01:12:17.745 --> 01:12:19.181
Hey, it's me,

01:12:19.215 --> 01:12:20.349
don't leave a message,
just come and get a drink.

01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:45.274
Coke me.

01:12:52.548 --> 01:12:54.849
One, two, three,

01:12:57.019 --> 01:12:58.687
Holy, chug a bean!

01:12:59.655 --> 01:13:02.691
Hey bud, it's me, your pal Al,

01:13:02.725 --> 01:13:04.826
just tryin' to get a
ballpark on your sobriety,

01:13:04.859 --> 01:13:07.096
so that our band can get signed.

01:13:07.129 --> 01:13:10.032
Oh, did we finish the tour?

01:13:10.065 --> 01:13:10.865
God.

01:13:10.899 --> 01:13:12.401
We didn't go on tour.

01:13:12.434 --> 01:13:15.404
Hey Kirk, hey, it's me, Brad.

01:13:15.437 --> 01:13:16.804
We're here to help you.

01:13:16.838 --> 01:13:18.674
He's just
super fucked up.

01:13:18.707 --> 01:13:20.709
You gotta choose to come back

01:13:20.743 --> 01:13:22.777
from that level of fucked up.

01:13:22.810 --> 01:13:23.979
Y'all should probably try to get

01:13:24.013 --> 01:13:26.215
his Stephan Hawking
lookin' ass up.

01:13:26.248 --> 01:13:27.416
Okay, come on.

01:13:27.449 --> 01:13:28.651
I aint
touchin' that shit.

01:13:28.684 --> 01:13:31.220
Come on, oh
there you go, hey,

01:13:31.253 --> 01:13:32.854
we're running out of time.

01:13:32.888 --> 01:13:33.722
I can't.

01:13:36.191 --> 01:13:37.660
Huh?

01:13:37.693 --> 01:13:38.761
I can't go.

01:13:42.031 --> 01:13:43.499
You can't go?

01:13:43.532 --> 01:13:44.967
No one knows what the fuck
you're talkin' about, dude.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.003
Hey, Kirk, you just
gotta let us know what you need

01:13:48.037 --> 01:13:49.238
because this A&R guy is...

01:13:49.271 --> 01:13:50.172
Yeah, time is
of the essence, here.

01:13:50.205 --> 01:13:51.440
Oh, Evan's essence.

01:13:51.473 --> 01:13:52.775
Oh boy, okay.

01:13:52.807 --> 01:13:54.910
Kirk, listen up, little nigga,

01:13:54.943 --> 01:13:56.979
I aint with all this Rick
James shit, all right?

01:13:57.012 --> 01:13:58.914
You only paid me
through last night,

01:13:58.947 --> 01:14:01.283
which means you'd better
sober the fuck up,

01:14:01.317 --> 01:14:04.386
or imma bounce, and this Murder
Dog shit aint goin' nowhere.

01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:07.189
Okay okay okay, hey
Kirk, it's Brad again.

01:14:07.222 --> 01:14:08.223
Dad?

01:14:08.257 --> 01:14:09.158
No, Brad.

01:14:10.259 --> 01:14:12.161
If you love her so much,

01:14:12.194 --> 01:14:15.097
why don't you just get
back together with her?

01:14:15.130 --> 01:14:16.465
Back together?

01:14:17.666 --> 01:14:22.004
Yeah, why don't you
just forgive the affair,

01:14:22.037 --> 01:14:25.441
and go after your one true love?

01:14:25.474 --> 01:14:26.475
True love?

01:14:27.976 --> 01:14:29.178
Oh my god.

01:14:29.211 --> 01:14:31.146
Yeah, get that love, Kirk.

01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:32.815
Yeah dude, for the
sake of the band,

01:14:32.847 --> 01:14:34.883
get back together with
Candice, you fickle bastard!

01:14:34.917 --> 01:14:36.518
Yeah, why don't you
ask her hand in marriage?

01:14:36.552 --> 01:14:39.021
Yeah, marry
her, marry her!

01:14:39.054 --> 01:14:42.991
Marry her,
marry her, marry her,

01:14:43.025 --> 01:14:44.760
marry her, marry her!

01:15:04.446 --> 01:15:05.647
There's
a guy out here

01:15:05.681 --> 01:15:07.549
who says his mom
fell or some shit?

01:15:07.583 --> 01:15:09.051
What?

01:15:09.084 --> 01:15:10.753
There's a guy
outside asking for you.

01:15:10.786 --> 01:15:11.787
Then let him in.

01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:12.888
He's underage.

01:15:12.921 --> 01:15:14.423
What, he's 17?

01:15:14.456 --> 01:15:16.959
- What?
- Let him in!

01:15:21.697 --> 01:15:24.032
Melanie, I'm sorry.

01:15:24.066 --> 01:15:26.935
My phone died, my
mom's in the hospital,

01:15:26.969 --> 01:15:28.470
Kirk has gone off the walls...

01:15:28.504 --> 01:15:29.405
Prove it.

01:15:29.438 --> 01:15:30.239
Prove what?

01:15:30.272 --> 01:15:31.173
Any of it.

01:15:31.206 --> 01:15:32.674
How am I supposed to prove it?

01:15:32.708 --> 01:15:35.811
Oh, fuck off, dude, I've
dated musicians before.

01:15:35.844 --> 01:15:38.380
One minute you're in
town, the next you're not,

01:15:38.414 --> 01:15:39.515
I'm not down.

01:15:40.382 --> 01:15:41.917
I'm not like that,

01:15:41.950 --> 01:15:45.654
if anyone's been fucked by
more musicians, it's me.

01:15:45.687 --> 01:15:47.389
Do you really just
expect me to believe

01:15:47.423 --> 01:15:48.791
that you're the one musician

01:15:48.824 --> 01:15:50.959
who's different from
all the rest of them?

01:15:50.993 --> 01:15:54.296
Yeah, maybe, I'm not
saying I'm better than them,

01:15:54.329 --> 01:15:56.665
but I think I've been
fucked over so many times

01:15:56.698 --> 01:16:00.469
I've learned not to
treat people like that.

01:16:00.502 --> 01:16:02.571
Come to hospital with me.

01:16:03.806 --> 01:16:05.374
Is she really in the hospital?

01:16:05.407 --> 01:16:07.743
Yes, come with me, please.

01:16:10.813 --> 01:16:11.613
You're awake.

01:16:11.647 --> 01:16:12.781
I feel good.

01:16:13.949 --> 01:16:16.518
Wait, wait, easy,
but hug me, oh.

01:16:17.386 --> 01:16:19.621
You look skinny, have you eaten?

01:16:19.655 --> 01:16:21.290
Nothin'.

01:16:21.323 --> 01:16:22.324
Who is that?

01:16:22.357 --> 01:16:23.725
That's Melanie.

01:16:23.759 --> 01:16:25.227
Hi, are
you the girlfriend?

01:16:26.094 --> 01:16:26.896
Yeah.

01:16:28.297 --> 01:16:30.365
- Just, maybe.
- Come on in.

01:16:32.902 --> 01:16:36.638
Honestly, I think this
all happened for a reason.

01:16:36.672 --> 01:16:38.942
Okay, so you and
I will make sure

01:16:38.974 --> 01:16:40.409
that golfer prick
is neutralized,

01:16:40.442 --> 01:16:42.144
and that Candice makes
it out to the front yard.

01:16:42.177 --> 01:16:43.645
Right on.

01:16:43.679 --> 01:16:46.215
And I'm gonna be with
Kirk for the grand finale.

01:16:46.248 --> 01:16:48.350
Do you wanna tell
us exactly what it is

01:16:48.383 --> 01:16:49.785
you're planning to do, Kirk?

01:16:49.818 --> 01:16:52.588
Oh, I know exactly
what me and Brad will do,

01:16:52.621 --> 01:16:56.592
just get her out to the
front, I'll get her back.

01:16:56.625 --> 01:16:59.761
All right, Gordon
Bombay on three, one, two.

01:16:59.795 --> 01:17:01.797
Gordon Bombay!

01:17:01.830 --> 01:17:04.500
Who the fuck is Gordon Bombay?

01:17:06.468 --> 01:17:08.670
Brad, can you go silent, over.

01:17:08.704 --> 01:17:09.738
Copy you, over.

01:17:09.771 --> 01:17:11.773
Horus, you there, over.

01:17:11.807 --> 01:17:13.575
What's poppin', over.

01:17:13.609 --> 01:17:15.444
Is it weird that
I am super pumped

01:17:15.477 --> 01:17:16.712
that this plan involves scarin'

01:17:16.745 --> 01:17:18.780
the living shit out of Candice?

01:17:18.814 --> 01:17:19.983
Over.

01:17:20.015 --> 01:17:23.385
Yo, I'm definitely
diggin' this plan, over.

01:17:28.023 --> 01:17:29.858
Hey, what's up chief?

01:17:29.893 --> 01:17:31.093
Mr. Fisk.

01:17:31.126 --> 01:17:32.427
That's right.

01:17:32.461 --> 01:17:36.064
Wow, I am so glad
that the universe

01:17:36.098 --> 01:17:38.400
put you and Kirk together, man.

01:17:38.433 --> 01:17:39.835
You're tellin' me, man.

01:17:39.868 --> 01:17:42.304
I'm a raging fan of Kirk's.

01:17:42.337 --> 01:17:43.605
Yeah, I've heard.

01:17:43.639 --> 01:17:44.740
Yeah.

01:17:44.773 --> 01:17:46.441
Thanks for the fan page.

01:17:46.475 --> 01:17:47.977
You saw the fan page?

01:17:48.011 --> 01:17:49.611
Yeah, it's great.

01:17:50.479 --> 01:17:51.680
It's great.

01:17:51.713 --> 01:17:54.884
Yeah, do you mind if
we go over the plan?

01:17:56.385 --> 01:17:57.887
The plan, yeah, of course,

01:17:57.921 --> 01:17:59.621
you don't wanna talk about
the fan page with me,

01:17:59.655 --> 01:18:00.856
no, that'd be crazy, huh?

01:18:00.890 --> 01:18:01.690
What am I thinking?

01:18:01.723 --> 01:18:03.425
Unless you did?

01:18:03.458 --> 01:18:06.261
Okay, the plan,
you and Horus Slays

01:18:06.295 --> 01:18:10.033
will enter through the
rear entry with these.

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:13.602
You will then escort
Ms. Candice White,

01:18:13.635 --> 01:18:14.570
who's a bitch.

01:18:14.603 --> 01:18:15.504
Oh, bless you.

01:18:15.537 --> 01:18:16.872
Thank you, to the front yard,

01:18:16.906 --> 01:18:19.207
where Kirk Stylo
will seduce her,

01:18:19.241 --> 01:18:22.879
and once again regain
his god-tier status.

01:18:22.912 --> 01:18:23.947
I love this.

01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:25.547
I love Kirk.

01:18:25.581 --> 01:18:26.782
Kirk, you gotta
fuckin' tell me...

01:18:26.815 --> 01:18:30.519
Over to
ground control, over.

01:18:30.552 --> 01:18:32.287
Copy that, over.

01:18:32.321 --> 01:18:35.090
Do not concede Kirk's
secret stash of energy snort

01:18:35.123 --> 01:18:36.725
until you hear code red,

01:18:36.758 --> 01:18:40.063
once he's caked, we only
got one shot at this, over.

01:18:40.095 --> 01:18:41.430
Where's my secret
stash of energy snort?

01:18:41.463 --> 01:18:43.967
Hey man, it's gonna be okay.

01:18:46.668 --> 01:18:47.836
Hey, how much longer, over.

01:18:47.869 --> 01:18:49.072
I know you possess it.

01:18:49.104 --> 01:18:51.406
I repeat, how
much longer, over.

01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:52.608
Horus, over.

01:18:53.742 --> 01:18:56.244
Oh shit, code red, code red.

01:18:57.412 --> 01:19:00.382
I'm just
unlocking it, okay?

01:19:00.415 --> 01:19:02.018
Code red, code red.

01:19:08.690 --> 01:19:09.791
Starting the timer now.

01:20:13.321 --> 01:20:16.425
Come into my house,
fuck, get down.

01:20:17.459 --> 01:20:19.594
Who the fuck are you, huh?

01:20:19.628 --> 01:20:20.796
Mafia, cartel?

01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:22.664
IRS?

01:20:27.703 --> 01:20:28.837
Horus Slays?

01:20:28.870 --> 01:20:29.671
Get the fuck out!

01:20:29.705 --> 01:20:30.605
Come on.

01:20:30.639 --> 01:20:31.873
Jeez, we're calling the cops.

01:20:31.908 --> 01:20:33.976
Put the
Motorola Razr down.

01:20:34.010 --> 01:20:35.510
Who
the fuck are you?

01:20:35.544 --> 01:20:36.745
I'm the founder of

01:20:36.778 --> 01:20:40.083
Stylo and the Murder
Dogs fan page, bitch.

01:20:40.116 --> 01:20:42.317

You need help, you're

01:22:51.813 --> 01:22:54.050
You all thought this
was a good idea?

01:22:54.083 --> 01:22:57.119
Well, it was
supposed to be like

01:22:57.153 --> 01:22:58.420
the opening scene
in "Old School,"

01:22:58.453 --> 01:22:59.354
where Will Ferrell's
getting married...

01:22:59.387 --> 01:23:02.091
Fuck, shut the fuck up Brad.

01:23:02.124 --> 01:23:04.126
Hey, I just wanna
announce that,

01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:08.264
as reparations for
me having non-sexual,

01:23:08.297 --> 01:23:12.168
but deeply intimate
relations with Candice,

01:23:12.201 --> 01:23:16.138
while she was, in fact,
with Kirk at the moment,

01:23:17.340 --> 01:23:19.474
I am releasing Stylo
and the Murder Dogs

01:23:19.507 --> 01:23:21.776
from their $33,000 debt.

01:23:21.810 --> 01:23:22.677
$33,000 debt?

01:23:22.711 --> 01:23:24.947
Shut the fuck up.

01:23:24.981 --> 01:23:26.883
If you don't get
Kirk off this lawn

01:23:26.916 --> 01:23:28.985
and into rehab
right fucking now,

01:23:29.018 --> 01:23:30.518
I swear to God I'm
gonna call the cops,

01:23:30.552 --> 01:23:31.988
I really mean it.

01:23:34.389 --> 01:23:35.390
Come on, man.

01:23:35.423 --> 01:23:36.658
Jesus Christ.

01:23:36.691 --> 01:23:37.592
Let's go
get you some help.

01:23:43.332 --> 01:23:44.532
You got it, Kirk.

01:23:44.566 --> 01:23:45.334
Let's get the
fuck out of here.

01:23:45.368 --> 01:23:46.534
Can you drive?

01:23:46.568 --> 01:23:47.336
Yeah,
let's go Kirk.

01:23:47.370 --> 01:23:48.770
Let's go.

01:23:50.839 --> 01:23:51.908
You did
what you could.

01:24:29.345 --> 01:24:30.179
Hi.

01:24:32.381 --> 01:24:34.216
Kirk, I got a, Kirk.

01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:38.720
No, fuck off!

01:24:53.302 --> 01:24:54.437
So now what?

01:24:55.338 --> 01:24:57.539
It's fuckin' over, isn't it?

01:24:57.572 --> 01:25:01.911
Well, best case scenario,
Kirk actually sobers up.

01:25:07.383 --> 01:25:10.785
That's like, but then
who the fuck is he?

01:25:12.587 --> 01:25:14.924
Kid's been pitted
since junior high.

01:25:14.957 --> 01:25:16.725
How long does it take
for someone to sober up?

01:25:16.758 --> 01:25:17.759
A few weeks?

01:25:19.728 --> 01:25:23.732
Sometimes you can't separate
greatness from mobeus, man.

01:25:23.765 --> 01:25:24.967
Yo, I think this is where

01:25:25.001 --> 01:25:28.636
our ships cross in the
night, fellas, I'm out.

01:25:28.670 --> 01:25:30.339
Best of luck to y'all, though.

01:25:30.373 --> 01:25:33.876
Don't forget, y'all
talented without Kirk,

01:25:35.011 --> 01:25:37.179
so keep your heads
up, all right?

01:25:37.213 --> 01:25:38.481
It's been good.

01:25:42.650 --> 01:25:43.919
All right, man.

01:25:45.121 --> 01:25:45.921
Stay up.

01:25:53.262 --> 01:25:56.664
If this Murder Dog
shit ever do take off,

01:25:57.766 --> 01:26:01.070
I'll waive my day
rate, plus I'm back in.

01:26:07.143 --> 01:26:10.012
Said they're gonna call us.

01:26:10.046 --> 01:26:12.348
Yeah, I left my
number with her.

01:26:12.381 --> 01:26:13.182
Same.

01:26:19.321 --> 01:26:21.257
Keep your head up, man.

01:26:23.893 --> 01:26:25.627
Hope your mom feels better.

01:26:25.660 --> 01:26:26.761
Thanks man.

01:26:27.930 --> 01:26:29.432
Let me know if
you hear anything.

01:26:29.465 --> 01:26:30.299
Will do.

01:26:43.946 --> 01:26:46.215
Somebody cleaned.

01:26:46.248 --> 01:26:47.450
Yep, where would
you like to be, mom?

01:26:47.483 --> 01:26:49.118
On the couch,
just right there.

01:26:49.151 --> 01:26:50.352
Oh here.

01:26:50.386 --> 01:26:53.122
Oh thanks, yep,
I got it, I got it.

01:26:56.559 --> 01:26:58.494
I gotta take this.

01:26:58.527 --> 01:27:00.996
Yeah, of course I got it.

01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:02.465
Can I get you anything?

01:27:02.498 --> 01:27:06.202
No, I understand you have
some kind of party van?

01:27:06.235 --> 01:27:07.069
Hello?

01:27:09.138 --> 01:27:10.372
Hello?

01:27:10.406 --> 01:27:11.673
Hello?

01:27:11.706 --> 01:27:12.508
Jordan?

01:27:12.541 --> 01:27:13.708
Can you hear?

01:27:13.741 --> 01:27:15.544
Sorry, I have horrible
service in my house,

01:27:15.578 --> 01:27:16.744
hey, can you hear me?

01:27:16.778 --> 01:27:18.581
Yes I can, I'm
just callin' to see

01:27:18.613 --> 01:27:21.951
how you're doin', how
everybody's doin'.

01:27:24.987 --> 01:27:26.489
How's your mom?

01:27:26.522 --> 01:27:27.689
Oh, she's doin' a lot better,

01:27:27.722 --> 01:27:28.924
we just got her home.

01:27:28.958 --> 01:27:30.993
Good to hear,
any news on Kirk,

01:27:31.026 --> 01:27:33.628
anybody gone over to visit?

01:27:33.661 --> 01:27:35.498
I guess he
has to invite us or something,

01:27:35.531 --> 01:27:36.932
I don't really know.

01:27:36.966 --> 01:27:38.633
Oh, yeah, that's too bad.

01:27:38.666 --> 01:27:40.603
Well hopefully
you'll be surprised

01:27:40.635 --> 01:27:44.540
at what comes out of the
situation, you never know.

01:27:44.573 --> 01:27:47.610
All you can do is keep
tryin' to make it happen.

01:27:47.642 --> 01:27:51.313
Yeah, that's what
my mom keeps sayin'.

01:27:51.347 --> 01:27:54.450
We'll catch 'em
next time, kid.

01:27:54.483 --> 01:27:55.918
Yes we will,

01:27:55.951 --> 01:27:57.785
I'll let you know if I
hear anything, all right?

01:27:57.819 --> 01:27:58.621
All right.

01:27:58.653 --> 01:28:00.222
Bye.

01:28:00.256 --> 01:28:02.657
What'd he say, how'd it go?

01:28:03.993 --> 01:28:05.528
Get your fuckin' hand off me.

01:28:05.561 --> 01:28:06.728
Yes, sorry.

01:29:08.823 --> 01:29:09.658
Hello?

01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:12.827
Sunnyside
Health Clinic,

01:29:12.860 --> 01:29:16.999
do you accept a call from
Bartholomew Stylopolis?

01:29:17.032 --> 01:29:17.865
Yeah.

01:29:25.975 --> 01:29:27.809
Stylo, ow ow!

01:29:28.677 --> 01:29:31.046
Check check check, check!

01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:33.848
Ladies and gentlemen,

called Dick Cheney,

01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:39.854
and it's the first song
I've ever written sober.

01:29:39.888 --> 01:29:41.856
And I'm gonna jam it.

01:29:41.890 --> 01:29:43.825
Yeah man!

01:29:43.858 --> 01:29:45.894
Where did he get
all this gear from?

01:29:45.928 --> 01:29:48.030
I honestly don't know.

01:30:00.976 --> 01:30:04.812
This is the riff, yeah,
get up here and jam.

01:30:04.846 --> 01:30:06.949
You too Horus, take over.

01:30:14.356 --> 01:30:18.460
Yeah, you just jam, yeah,
yes, double the hi-hat.

01:30:22.331 --> 01:30:24.166
Now follow that, yeah.

01:30:31.573 --> 01:30:32.741
Doctor, I couldn't
have gotten here.

01:30:32.775 --> 01:30:33.542
Are you sure?

01:30:33.575 --> 01:30:34.376
I think we got it now.

01:30:34.410 --> 01:30:35.277
Okay, you're sure.

01:30:35.311 --> 01:30:36.178

01:32:40.469 --> 01:32:42.371
and I feel like I got shot, man.

01:32:42.404 --> 01:32:43.639
Dick Cheney didn't get shot.

01:32:43.672 --> 01:32:44.573
Never be the same.

01:32:44.606 --> 01:32:46.208
He shot the fuckin' guy.

01:32:46.241 --> 01:32:47.209
Yeah.

01:32:47.242 --> 01:32:48.010
Are you
sure about that?

01:32:48.043 --> 01:32:49.678
100% sure, yeah.

01:32:51.113 --> 01:32:53.315
I'm sure, MmmHmm.

01:32:53.348 --> 01:32:56.685
I don't know, I
gotta take this.

01:32:56.718 --> 01:32:58.320
Talk to me, Jordan.

01:32:58.353 --> 01:33:00.856
I got someone here, hold on.

01:33:02.024 --> 01:33:03.592
Hey
Kirk, this is Jim.

01:33:03.625 --> 01:33:05.594
I don't know any Jims.

01:33:05.627 --> 01:33:08.630
Jim Atkins,
from Jimmy Eat World, hey.

01:33:08.664 --> 01:33:10.165
