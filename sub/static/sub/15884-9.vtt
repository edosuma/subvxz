00:01.381 --> 00:02.682
Hoo!
Great hike today, buddy.

00:02.717 --> 00:04.586
I was coming up
that last hill,

00:04.620 --> 00:06.891
And I turned around and
you were nowhere to be found.

00:06.925 --> 00:08.197
Mm-hmm.

00:08.231 --> 00:09.368
Thought I was gonna have to
go back and get you.

00:09.402 --> 00:12.405
Uh, at least we made it.

00:14.508 --> 00:18.678
Oh, yeah, I forgot to tell you,
I talk in my sleep.

00:18.712 --> 00:20.849
- Oh.
- Yeah, quite a bit, actually,

00:20.883 --> 00:24.421
So if it bothers you,
just wake me up.

00:24.456 --> 00:26.657
- Okay, buddy.
- Cool.

00:26.691 --> 00:29.693
- Good night.
- Good night.

00:33.869 --> 00:37.139
Dick head.

00:37.174 --> 00:41.011
You stupid dick head.

00:41.045 --> 00:44.415
(imitating Key) "Hey, Jordan,
oh, let's go camping, come on.

00:44.449 --> 00:46.550
"Oh, Jordan, keep hiking.
We're almost there.

00:46.584 --> 00:48.752
"Oh, buddy."
(chuckles)

00:48.787 --> 00:50.554
So much [bleep] energy.

00:50.588 --> 00:53.691
Just shove that clif bar
up your ass,

00:53.726 --> 00:56.731
You bald [bleep]sucker.

00:58.736 --> 01:02.507
(whispering)
Jordan, Jordan.

01:02.541 --> 01:08.815
[bleep] you,
Keegan... hyphen... Michael... Key.

01:08.849 --> 01:10.483
Jordan, wake up,

01:10.517 --> 01:12.987
- you're talking in your sleep.
- Not asleep yet.

01:13.021 --> 01:15.990

01:35.312 --> 01:36.946
- Oh!
- Whoa.

01:41.486 --> 01:43.687
- (low chatter) Muay thai.
- Muay thai, muay thai.

01:43.722 --> 01:46.090
(cheers and applause)

01:46.124 --> 01:47.825
- Thank you, thank you.
- Thank you.

01:47.859 --> 01:50.863
You guys are awesome!

01:50.897 --> 01:53.265
Thank you so much.
I am Keegan-Michael Key.

01:53.300 --> 01:55.067
- I'm Jordan Peele.
- And we are Key and Peele.

01:55.102 --> 01:58.004
Yeah, so...
(cheers and applause)

01:58.038 --> 01:59.572
Thank you.

01:59.607 --> 02:02.342
Uh, ladies, are you--
how you doing tonight?

02:02.376 --> 02:04.511
(cheers and applause)

02:04.546 --> 02:06.914
You're good.
They're good.

02:06.948 --> 02:08.416
Every lady
I've ever dated

02:08.449 --> 02:11.118
somehow gets the impression
I can fight.

02:11.152 --> 02:13.453
Oh, that's-- that's bad news
right off the bat.

02:13.487 --> 02:15.721
- That's bad news.
- 'cause he cannot, yes.

02:15.756 --> 02:17.222
- I can--well--
- Nor can I.

02:17.257 --> 02:19.591
If I guy says
something disrespectful

02:19.625 --> 02:21.258
to a lady that I'm with,

02:21.293 --> 02:22.793
I'll just pretend
like I didn't--

02:22.827 --> 02:25.661
- I-I went blind.
- Somehow you didn't hear it?

02:25.696 --> 02:27.162
- Oh, man.
- Did you hear that?

02:27.197 --> 02:28.196
- I didn't--sss--
- Did you hear what he just

02:28.231 --> 02:29.665
- said to me right here?
- I just had

02:29.699 --> 02:32.867
temporary blind- and deafness.
I don't know what's--

02:32.902 --> 02:34.201
- He was standing right here.
- He said that?

02:34.236 --> 02:35.536
He was standing right here,
calling me a--

02:35.570 --> 02:38.271
Where he at, where he at?
He left?

02:38.306 --> 02:40.173
- See. aw, man.
- No, he right here.

02:40.207 --> 02:41.373
- He right here.
- No, I don't know

02:41.408 --> 02:42.541
where you pointing.
I don't know what--

02:42.575 --> 02:45.277
No, he's right--
he's right here.

02:45.311 --> 02:46.678
He's listening to you talk
right now.

02:46.712 --> 02:48.112
- Step to me!
- No, no.

02:48.147 --> 02:49.947
- Show yourself!
- This way. He's--

02:49.982 --> 02:51.983
- It ain't happening.
- He's right here.

02:52.017 --> 02:53.985
He is right--
He is right--

02:54.020 --> 02:55.654
- Baby, baby, baby.
- Oh, well--

02:55.688 --> 02:58.056
(crowd screams)
(both laughing)

03:00.425 --> 03:02.091
- (sighs)
- (clears throat)

03:02.126 --> 03:05.294
- Can you totally chill out?
- No, I'm so annoyed right now.

03:05.328 --> 03:07.162
Can you, like, not talk to me
for, like, a second?

03:07.197 --> 03:09.231
Like, that'd be great.
That'd be fine.

03:09.265 --> 03:10.699
That'd be fine by me.

03:10.734 --> 03:12.868
What?
Oh, my God, are you serious?

03:12.903 --> 03:15.037
This is bull[bleep].
What could possibly

03:15.072 --> 03:17.273
be the problem with letting
two more people in?

03:17.307 --> 03:19.143
Check your girl, bro.

03:19.177 --> 03:20.978
- I'm sorry.
- Excuse me, what did you say?

03:21.012 --> 03:23.414
"Check your girl"? Uh-uhh,
It doesn't work like that.

03:23.448 --> 03:25.449
No one checks me
because I'm not luggage.

03:25.483 --> 03:30.122
Okay? So you can go
[bleep] yoursee-elf.

03:30.156 --> 03:32.024
Meegan, seriously,

03:32.058 --> 03:34.259
Two more people are gonna
come out in a couple of seconds,

03:34.294 --> 03:35.560
and then we can go in.

03:35.595 --> 03:37.062
No!
Let me ask you a question.

03:37.097 --> 03:38.664
What was it like
being in <i>The Green Mile</i> ?

03:38.698 --> 03:40.699
He wasn't in <i>The Green Mile</i>!

03:40.734 --> 03:42.134
He clearly wasn't
in that movie.

03:42.169 --> 03:44.004
What does Tom Hanks's penis
feel like?

03:44.038 --> 03:46.106
- Meegan!
- Moreover, how does it feel

03:46.140 --> 03:48.408
when swarms of bees
are coming out of your face?

03:48.443 --> 03:50.310
Seriously, I'm sorry.
It's, like, her favorite movie.

03:50.344 --> 03:51.544
Don't apologize for me!

03:51.579 --> 03:52.946
Yeah, this is nice,
this is nice.

03:52.980 --> 03:55.181
You look like Common meets
The Incredible Hulk.

03:55.216 --> 03:56.416
- Meegan--
- When you brought

03:56.450 --> 03:58.219
the frankincense to Baby Jesus,
Did they, like...

03:58.253 --> 04:00.154
- Oh.
- make you stand

04:00.188 --> 04:01.655
outside the barn
because you were too big,

04:01.690 --> 04:04.358
or did they invite you in
with all the other animals?

04:04.393 --> 04:05.726
Don't flare your nostrils
at me,

04:05.761 --> 04:07.494
- okay?
- He's--

04:07.529 --> 04:09.029
Do you have any idea
how impolite that is?

04:09.064 --> 04:13.501
He hasn't moved his nostrils
once since we got here.

04:13.536 --> 04:15.837
- I saw them move!
- They did not move, Meegan.

04:15.872 --> 04:16.904
They flared!

04:16.939 --> 04:18.640
Meegan, they [bleep]
did not move!

04:18.673 --> 04:22.710
Your nostrils flared more than
a survivor from a boat accident.

04:22.745 --> 04:23.979
What?

04:24.013 --> 04:24.980
He's not even looking me
in the eyes.

04:25.014 --> 04:26.381
Okay, you know what?

04:26.415 --> 04:28.850
If you're just going to continue
to be a little prick,

04:28.885 --> 04:30.952
you're gonna get your ass
kicked.

04:30.987 --> 04:33.555
Don't touch him, Mee--
Meegan.

04:33.589 --> 04:35.957
(scoffs)
Crazy bitch.

04:35.992 --> 04:37.893
(gasps)

04:37.927 --> 04:40.061
(squeaks)

04:40.096 --> 04:42.130
(sighs)

04:45.768 --> 04:47.502
Oh!

04:47.537 --> 04:50.005
I totally love my nails
right now.

04:51.641 --> 04:53.742
I'm so over everything
right now,

04:53.776 --> 04:56.477
over the floor,
I'm over the sky, I'm over you,

04:56.511 --> 04:57.911
over that pussy back there.

04:57.946 --> 04:59.613
You're a pussy!

04:59.648 --> 05:01.415
- Meegan, seriously.
- Whatever.

05:01.450 --> 05:03.050
(makes kissing sounds)

05:03.085 --> 05:04.519
Nice legs, little lady.
(laughter)

05:04.553 --> 05:07.622
Um, excuse me?

05:07.656 --> 05:09.390
Oh, God!

05:09.425 --> 05:10.992
Hey, what did you say?

05:11.026 --> 05:14.095
What the [bleep]
did you just say?

05:14.129 --> 05:18.265
You guys come back here with
your little itty-bitty dicks.

05:20.902 --> 05:22.536
You best control your lady.

05:22.570 --> 05:24.171
- Yup.
- (gasps) Excuse--

05:24.205 --> 05:27.608
"Control your lady"?
No, he doesn't control me,

05:27.642 --> 05:30.444
'cause let me tell you
something, I'm not a remote.

05:30.478 --> 05:33.180
Meegan, baby,
can we just let this go?

05:33.214 --> 05:35.315
No, I'm talking to the Pussies
of Anarchy right now.

05:35.350 --> 05:36.817
- Oh, boy.
- Yeah, you.

05:36.851 --> 05:39.052
Why don't you all
gather yourselves,

05:39.087 --> 05:41.221
and why don't you just go
and figure out a way

05:41.255 --> 05:44.424
to [bleep] on each other's
leathery peni.

05:44.459 --> 05:46.427
- Hey, [bleep] you, bitch!
- (gasps)

05:46.461 --> 05:49.463
- Oh, no.
- (squeaks)

05:52.467 --> 05:54.468
(sighs)

05:55.971 --> 05:59.073
It's not even the plural
of "penis."

05:59.107 --> 06:00.074
- (punching thud)
- Yeah!

06:00.108 --> 06:01.242
(thugs laughing)

06:01.276 --> 06:05.412
I'm the queen of the world!

06:05.447 --> 06:08.148
Yes!
I feel invincible!

06:08.183 --> 06:11.485
Like I have super powers
or something. Ha ha!

06:11.520 --> 06:13.888
You hear that,
all you [bleep] of the world?

06:13.923 --> 06:16.725
I can do anything I want,
and no one can stop me.

06:16.759 --> 06:18.793
Because you don't have to
fight your own fights,

06:18.828 --> 06:20.529
- you crazy bitch!
- (gasps)

06:20.563 --> 06:23.198
- Oh, boy.
- (squeaks)

06:23.233 --> 06:26.702
Oh, no.

06:26.736 --> 06:28.837
(squeaks)

06:28.871 --> 06:30.572
(sighs)

06:30.606 --> 06:33.709
Ugh! Oh.

06:33.743 --> 06:36.211
Nothing can stop me!

06:37.213 --> 06:38.213
Action.

06:38.247 --> 06:39.548
Hey, have you ever
found yourself

06:39.582 --> 06:42.217
in High Point, North Carolina,
and not feeling safe?

06:42.251 --> 06:46.154
Come on down to Doug Duggart's
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

06:46.189 --> 06:48.289
You will learn
to tackle and grapple,

06:48.324 --> 06:50.091
(gong rings)
And--

06:50.126 --> 06:52.694
(gong echoing)

06:52.728 --> 06:54.762
like a ultimate fighting pro.

06:54.796 --> 06:57.029
At my studio, you get
hands-on training,

06:57.064 --> 06:58.798
(both grunting)

06:58.832 --> 07:00.466
and individual attention.

07:00.500 --> 07:04.669
So hut! Hut!
(grunting)

07:04.703 --> 07:06.370
Tackle and grapple.

07:06.405 --> 07:08.972
Take on multiple enemies.

07:09.006 --> 07:11.974
This is a tackle.
That's a grapple.

07:12.008 --> 07:13.975
This is a tackle.

07:14.010 --> 07:15.543
That's a grapple.

07:15.578 --> 07:17.110
Get-- There we go.

07:17.145 --> 07:18.978
(grunts)

07:19.012 --> 07:20.379
Tackle and grapple!

07:20.413 --> 07:24.416
All ages, learn to protect
yourself and your loved ones.

07:30.055 --> 07:32.189
There are many
different levels.

07:32.223 --> 07:33.723
There's the beginner level,

07:33.758 --> 07:37.593
and if you pass my private
one-on-one sensei trial,

07:37.627 --> 07:40.862
you may make it
into the advanced class.

07:40.897 --> 07:42.029
Tackle and grapple!

07:42.064 --> 07:43.631
Doug Duggart's
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu

07:43.665 --> 07:45.832
at the High Point mini mall.
Just east of the pizza barn

07:45.867 --> 07:48.502
two doors down from Carl's
Discount Wheels and Furniture.

07:48.536 --> 07:50.003
So-- quick tackle!
Get down. (grunts)

07:50.038 --> 07:51.538
(muttering)

07:51.573 --> 07:54.141
(all grunting)

07:54.176 --> 07:55.710
No, stay-- stay away.

07:55.744 --> 07:57.712
Special discounts
for college students.

07:57.746 --> 07:59.347
S-- Mm, move it.
Get your leg back.

07:59.381 --> 08:00.515
(gong rings)

08:00.549 --> 08:03.884
Put your leg back there.
(gong echoing)

08:08.069 --> 08:09.603
There's an elevator etiquette,

08:09.637 --> 08:11.571
and people gotta be following
this etiquette.

08:11.606 --> 08:14.475
When I get on an elevator
and I press six

08:14.509 --> 08:17.078
and the light lights up,
and you get in the elevator,

08:17.112 --> 08:19.547
if you're going to six
and you see the light's lit up,

08:19.581 --> 08:21.682
don't [bleep] touch
the button.

08:21.716 --> 08:24.117
Dit-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit
diddle-diddle-dit

08:24.152 --> 08:26.453
dit-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit
diddle-diddle-dit.

08:26.487 --> 08:27.754
What are you doing,
Morse code up in here?

08:27.789 --> 08:29.256
Yeah, that's right, man,
I'm sending--

08:29.290 --> 08:30.424
sending a telegram.

08:30.458 --> 08:31.791
Sometimes it makes the doors
go faster.

08:31.826 --> 08:32.792
- Oh, yeah?
- You want to really

08:32.827 --> 08:34.059
- get it going...
- Uh-huh.

08:34.095 --> 08:35.629
- You gotta warm it up.
- Yeah, yeah.

08:35.663 --> 08:36.730
- Dit-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit.
- Yeah. yeah,

08:36.765 --> 08:37.932
The doors have not yet
closed, sir.

08:37.966 --> 08:39.467
Every elevator's different,
man.

08:39.501 --> 08:43.070
I'm a elevator whisperer,
really, is what I am.

08:43.105 --> 08:45.974
This one needs a little care,
needs a little tender--

08:46.008 --> 08:47.876
tender TLC.
Come on, baby.

08:47.910 --> 08:49.411
What's--

08:49.445 --> 08:52.814
Come on, baby.
Let's get it going.

08:52.848 --> 08:54.615
Let's get it going.

08:54.650 --> 08:56.117
She's not responding to you.

08:56.151 --> 08:58.319
You know, I'm just--
just gonna take the next one.

08:58.353 --> 09:00.355
Yeah, all right, all right.

09:05.426 --> 09:07.594
Uh, I actually pressed it
already.

09:07.628 --> 09:10.631
- Mmm?
- The walk button, I pressed it.

09:16.903 --> 09:18.537
Couldn't hurt
to press it again.

09:18.571 --> 09:19.738
But it won't help.

09:19.773 --> 09:22.675
I mean, I pressed it
already, right?

09:22.709 --> 09:24.678
It's already done.

09:24.712 --> 09:26.479
You don't think
I didn't press it?

09:26.514 --> 09:28.782
No, I wasn't saying that.

09:28.817 --> 09:31.919
Good, 'cause I most certainly
did press it.

09:31.954 --> 09:34.956
Just have to wait for it
to change.

09:40.595 --> 09:42.564
So I'm, like,
late for work,

09:42.598 --> 09:44.532
So I'm just--
just gonna press it.

09:44.567 --> 09:47.536
What for? Why would you do
something that's already done?

09:47.570 --> 09:53.242
I mean, I just think that
that's crazy, right?

09:53.276 --> 09:55.377
- I dunno.
- You wouldn't suit up

09:55.411 --> 09:58.780
and try to kill Bin Laden again.
It's done.

09:58.814 --> 10:03.818
I have killed the Bin laden
of pressing this button.

10:03.852 --> 10:06.154
How long ago
did you press it?

10:06.188 --> 10:08.757
What do you think, I've been
standing here for days?

10:08.791 --> 10:10.058
- I--
- I just pressed it

10:10.092 --> 10:11.693
right as you walked up.

10:11.728 --> 10:13.128
Are you sure
you pressed it?

10:13.163 --> 10:15.464
Am I sure I pressed it?
It's--how could I miss it?

10:15.498 --> 10:17.833
(scoffs) Rats know
how to press buttons.

10:17.867 --> 10:19.234
Do you think
I'm dumber than a rat?

10:19.268 --> 10:22.204
No. No, nobody's saying
anything like that, man.

10:22.238 --> 10:25.240
It's gonna change.
Just--just wait.

10:25.274 --> 10:27.609
It's because I pressed it
already.

10:27.643 --> 10:30.445
Okay, no offense.
I'm just gonna press it.

10:30.479 --> 10:32.648
What would you do that for?
This is precision equipment

10:32.682 --> 10:34.817
Designed by people
with engineering degrees.

10:34.851 --> 10:35.952
It will work.

10:35.986 --> 10:38.588
I pressed it, sir!
I pressed the button!

10:38.622 --> 10:40.223
While we've been
standing here,

10:40.257 --> 10:42.792
the light cycle
has gone by twice, okay?

10:42.826 --> 10:44.627
I'm not saying
you didn't press it.

10:44.661 --> 10:45.828
I'm just saying
maybe it didn't work!

10:45.863 --> 10:47.063
If it didn't work for me,

10:47.097 --> 10:49.699
why in the world
would it work for you?

10:49.733 --> 10:53.636
You think that it would
change faster if you pressed it?

10:53.671 --> 10:55.605
You think the light
doesn't like me, or something,

10:55.639 --> 10:58.808
or do you think that this
particular button was designed

10:58.843 --> 11:00.043
so that it only works

11:00.077 --> 11:01.978
after the second time
that it's been pressed?

11:02.013 --> 11:04.781
'cause that's lunacy, okay?
Do you understand?

11:04.816 --> 11:08.051
Do not cut my balls off
on this one, okay?

11:08.086 --> 11:12.622
Please,
do not press the button...

11:12.657 --> 11:13.790
again.

11:13.825 --> 11:18.162
Okay, fine!
We'll just stand here!

11:18.196 --> 11:21.899
Thank you.

11:21.933 --> 11:23.968
- What?
- Hey, no!

11:24.002 --> 11:25.970
Oh! oh!

11:26.004 --> 11:28.772
Told you shouldn't have pressed
the button.

11:28.807 --> 11:31.007
Told him not to do that.

11:31.041 --> 11:34.041
No, actually, I already
pressed the button, sir.

11:36.843 --> 11:37.943
(dance music)

11:37.977 --> 11:40.445
All right, fellas,
Coming to the stage next

11:40.479 --> 11:42.880
is the beautiful Galaxy.

11:42.915 --> 11:46.084
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, baby.

11:46.118 --> 11:48.553
â™ª

11:48.588 --> 11:50.589
Oh.

11:50.623 --> 11:52.257
â™ª

11:52.292 --> 11:55.160
Gon' be for you.
(chuckles)

11:55.195 --> 11:56.428
You can keep it.

11:56.463 --> 11:58.230
There's more
where that came from too.

11:58.265 --> 12:00.233
Trust me.

12:00.267 --> 12:01.701
(whistles)

12:01.735 --> 12:04.370
There's my girl.
Oh, damn.

12:04.404 --> 12:06.839
I'm straight up talkin' 'bout
some Darryl Dawkins right here,

12:06.873 --> 12:07.840
Because this
some chocolate thunder.

12:07.874 --> 12:09.742
What, girl?
Make it rain!

12:09.776 --> 12:11.443
(laughs)
Yeah.

12:11.478 --> 12:13.946
- Oh, yeah, girl.
- I try to make it last!

12:13.981 --> 12:15.948
(laughs)

12:15.983 --> 12:18.651
(mutters)
What--

12:18.685 --> 12:20.019
All right, girl, mmm.

12:20.053 --> 12:22.021
Sha-pam! I'ma get it
right in the booty right there.

12:22.056 --> 12:23.389
Uh, and booty-swam!

12:23.424 --> 12:24.924
That's what you call
a booty investment.

12:24.959 --> 12:26.593
(laughs)
Sha-blam!

12:26.627 --> 12:29.729
But you really don't need
to give 'em that much.

12:29.763 --> 12:31.264
I don't think
they're expecting all that.

12:31.298 --> 12:33.232
Whoo!

12:33.267 --> 12:35.101
It's kind of like
feeding a squirrel, you know?

12:35.135 --> 12:37.169
I mean, they will
come back to you, so--

12:37.203 --> 12:39.371
Oh, oh, oh, my gosh.
Some of this is getting lost.

12:39.406 --> 12:40.606
Let's get it right
where it needs to be.

12:40.640 --> 12:43.375
- Right in there, baby. oh, yeah.
- Keep it classy.

12:43.410 --> 12:45.177
- Ha ha ha!
- Keep it classy.

12:45.211 --> 12:46.678
Oh, [bleep], somebody
better get a umbrella,

12:46.713 --> 12:48.013
'cause I can't stop
making it rain.

12:48.047 --> 12:49.548
It's like Noah's flood
up in here.

12:49.582 --> 12:53.585
Whoo, two by two, baby.
Two by two! Ha ha!

12:53.620 --> 12:55.320
Baby, you don't know
that I'm the General,

12:55.355 --> 12:57.590
'cause it's Stormin' Norman.
That's what they be calling me.

12:57.624 --> 13:01.302
(velcro slowly tearing)

13:05.565 --> 13:07.132
- Ahh.
- Damn.

13:07.167 --> 13:09.735
Anyway, like I said,
when you finish training,

13:09.769 --> 13:11.570
we'll get Scotty Musso
up in here.

13:11.604 --> 13:13.939
That [bleep]
can train a boxer.

13:20.446 --> 13:23.448
(laughs)
Ooh, Lord have mercy.

13:23.482 --> 13:25.016
You don't know nothing
about this. (laughs)

13:25.050 --> 13:27.118
Make it rain!

13:27.152 --> 13:28.653
- Aah!
- What the--

13:28.687 --> 13:30.087
Are you an idiot?

13:30.122 --> 13:32.923
Leon,
get this guy outta here.

13:32.957 --> 13:35.859
All right, nobody move!
There he is.

13:35.894 --> 13:36.927
There who is?

13:36.962 --> 13:38.429
- You, on your feet!
- What?

13:38.464 --> 13:41.065
- On your feet.
- What I do?

13:41.099 --> 13:43.500
You're under arrest
for photocopying money.

13:43.535 --> 13:45.536
Oh, goddamn it!

13:45.570 --> 13:48.339
You know how long it took me
to cut all that out?

13:48.373 --> 13:51.075
I got carpal tunnel syndrome
up in this bitch,

13:51.109 --> 13:53.177
calluses on the inside
of my thumbs.

13:53.211 --> 13:54.845
That's definitely real,
though.

13:57.128 --> 13:59.096
(soul music)

13:59.130 --> 14:01.898
Remember the character
that Laurence Fishburne played

14:01.933 --> 14:04.367
in <i>Boyz N the Hood</i> ?
Furious, right?

14:04.401 --> 14:08.071
We love those characters
who are--like, the older dudes

14:08.105 --> 14:09.573
who just have to be
spouting advice

14:09.607 --> 14:11.041
to everybody in the movie.

14:11.075 --> 14:15.946
Dude walking around with
some sort of food in his hand.

14:15.980 --> 14:17.981
Want a lemonhead, son?
You want a lemonhead?

14:18.016 --> 14:21.785
You want a lemonhead, son?
Want a lemonhead?

14:21.819 --> 14:24.488
I got corn nuts in this hand,
lemonheads in this hand.

14:24.522 --> 14:26.490
(laughs)

14:26.525 --> 14:28.559
Which one you want?

14:28.594 --> 14:29.895
The funny thing
about those dudes,

14:29.929 --> 14:32.064
those dudes, they're never,
like, in their 70s.

14:32.098 --> 14:33.999
They were always,
like, in their 40s or 50s.

14:34.033 --> 14:35.133
- Mm-hmm.
- [bleep], why is you--

14:35.167 --> 14:37.535
- why don't you have a job?
- Yeah.

14:37.570 --> 14:39.504
- How are you giving me advice?
- Where is your job?

14:39.538 --> 14:40.905
He's just, like, you know,
sitting on--

14:40.940 --> 14:43.174
Boy, you need to get out there
and get yourself employed,

14:43.209 --> 14:44.809
- so something with your life.
- Mm-hmm.

14:44.844 --> 14:46.912
'cause I ain't got time
for no monkey business.

14:46.946 --> 14:48.113
Mm-hmm.

14:48.147 --> 14:50.381
And what do you do
for a living, sir?

14:50.416 --> 14:53.817
L-- Advise.

14:55.000 --> 15:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15:02.359 --> 15:05.861
Mm, brothers, brothers,
brothers,

15:05.896 --> 15:10.333
see, when are we gon' think
of ourselves as more than this?

15:10.367 --> 15:11.968
(chuckles)

15:12.002 --> 15:14.103
What y'all doing,
y'all rollin'? huh?

15:14.138 --> 15:15.204
(chuckles)

15:15.239 --> 15:17.106
Flippin'? Stoopin'?
(chuckles)

15:17.140 --> 15:18.874
Boxin'? Maxin'?

15:18.908 --> 15:20.409
Chaxin'?

15:20.443 --> 15:22.711
I used to stoop.
Oh, yeah.

15:22.745 --> 15:25.047
I used to flip, roll, you know,
whatever you want to call it.

15:25.081 --> 15:27.216
(chuckles)
Me and my crew,

15:27.250 --> 15:31.821
we would get into activity,
much like yourselves.

15:31.856 --> 15:35.058
You see, the problem was,
we were only perpetuating

15:35.092 --> 15:38.228
the stereotype the system
already assumes about us.

15:38.262 --> 15:41.130
Mm.
You see, we need to

15:41.165 --> 15:44.400
stop feeding into
the preconceived notions

15:44.435 --> 15:45.902
that we are all--

15:45.936 --> 15:49.505
Great job, you guys.
You really work hard today.

15:49.539 --> 15:54.210
I wish I could pay you more,
but you know how it is.

15:54.245 --> 15:57.581
Eh--who are you, huh?
What do you want?

15:57.616 --> 16:01.152
I-I don't know.

16:01.186 --> 16:02.686
As you were.

16:02.721 --> 16:04.788
As you were what,
smart guy?

16:04.823 --> 16:07.725
(cursing in foreign language)

16:09.794 --> 16:14.398
Mmm. Oh, ho.
Brothers, brothers, brothers,

16:14.432 --> 16:17.869
Look at yourselves.
Pants hangin' off your ass,

16:17.903 --> 16:19.704
Looking like
a couple of clowns--

16:19.738 --> 16:23.574
which you are. Okay,
enjoy the birthday celebration.

16:23.609 --> 16:24.776
Gimme your [bleep] money,
Bitch!

16:24.810 --> 16:26.044
- No! No!
- I said,

16:26.078 --> 16:28.446
- gimme your [bleep] money, bitch!
- Oh! Oh!

16:28.481 --> 16:30.915
- (grunts)
- Brother, brother, brother.

16:30.950 --> 16:34.519
Sir, everybody
in this self-defense class

16:34.554 --> 16:36.488
has already paid
to participate.

16:36.522 --> 16:39.456
If you're interested,
you can sign up online.

16:41.258 --> 16:42.692
- I'm interested.
- Good.

16:42.726 --> 16:44.426
That's why I came over here.
I'm interested.

16:44.460 --> 16:45.793
I'm gon' think about it.

16:45.827 --> 16:48.828
- I'm interested.
- Thank you, sir.

16:48.862 --> 16:51.463
Now, ladies, it's gon' get
really intense today,

16:51.498 --> 16:52.764
no matter what happens.

16:52.799 --> 16:55.600
I will be groping
your breastasies

16:55.634 --> 16:57.434
as if you were being attacked
like a real attacker.

16:57.469 --> 17:02.071
Brother, brother, my brother.
Now, I was watching you.

17:02.105 --> 17:06.741
Now, you older brothers
need to break the stereotype

17:06.775 --> 17:09.376
and stop being so preachy.

17:09.410 --> 17:10.609
- You know what?
- Mm?

17:10.645 --> 17:11.743
- I'm preachy?
- Mm.

17:11.778 --> 17:13.111
Come on.
(scoffs)

17:13.145 --> 17:16.480
You preachy, man.
Plus, you older than me.

17:16.513 --> 17:20.316
I'm nine years old.
I got Benjamin Button's disease.

17:20.349 --> 17:24.352
S-- I'm done. I'm done.

17:29.157 --> 17:31.257
(imitating Key) "Oh, nature's
gonna be so great once we get--"

17:31.291 --> 17:35.459
Shove nature up your ass,
you bald [bleep]sucker.

17:35.493 --> 17:39.628
And by "bald [bleep]sucker,"
I mean you suck bald [bleep].

17:39.662 --> 17:40.662
Still awake.

17:43.601 --> 17:45.468
(soul music)

17:45.503 --> 17:47.704
Do you guys-- do you guys
like funk music?

17:47.738 --> 17:48.772
(all) Yeah.
(cheers and applause)

17:48.806 --> 17:49.940
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

17:49.974 --> 17:51.842
I tell you, funk music
is a real testament

17:51.876 --> 17:53.811
to what a big group of people
can do

17:53.845 --> 17:55.680
- when they take acid together.
- Yes.

17:55.714 --> 17:59.217
It's really...
It's just fantastic.

17:59.251 --> 18:01.485
It looks like
a Halloween party for kids

18:01.519 --> 18:03.320
- when the parents was just drunk.
- Yeah, right, exactly.

18:03.354 --> 18:04.421
It's like, "I don't know,
just put some [bleep] on."

18:04.456 --> 18:05.789
"I don't--put this on
and just-- blip!

18:05.824 --> 18:07.458
"Just stick on that
in the head

18:07.492 --> 18:10.261
- "and wear nothing but a diaper."
- Yeah, you know.

18:10.295 --> 18:12.329
And the funny thing is,
the lyrics are just kind of

18:12.364 --> 18:15.099
a combination of some mode
of transportation...

18:15.133 --> 18:17.268
- Mm-hmm.
- a food,

18:17.302 --> 18:18.536
- and an animal.
- Mm-hmm.

18:18.570 --> 18:22.941
â™ª Intergalactic hang glider
with a dog â™ª

18:22.975 --> 18:24.408
Mm-hmm.

18:24.443 --> 18:26.343
- And just get it in there.
- Yeah.

18:26.377 --> 18:30.880
â™ª Ostrich farm vanilla puddin'
Give it to me, y'all â™ª

18:30.914 --> 18:32.048
- (laughs)
- Right?

18:32.082 --> 18:33.149
That's it.

18:33.184 --> 18:34.317
Might've made
too much sense there.

18:34.351 --> 18:35.718
Yeah, might have made
too much sense, yeah.

18:35.753 --> 18:37.153
It might've made-- like,
"No, that's not funky,

18:37.187 --> 18:38.688
