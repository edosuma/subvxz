04:10.160 --> 04:12.680
Enemy torpedo at bearing 1-9-0.

04:12.800 --> 04:15.480
- 7...
- Dive the submarine. Keep 50 meters.

04:15.560 --> 04:16.920
Keep 50 meters.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.800
- Both turbines full ahead together.
- Full ahead together.

04:19.920 --> 04:22.480
...3, 2, 1 . Captain!

04:23.680 --> 04:26.960
- Force manual override!
- Launching sequence not responding.

04:27.080 --> 04:30.360
- Estimate torpedo at 6,000 meters.
- The drill is over.

04:33.600 --> 04:38.960
Well, Commander Polenin.
Do you have an explanation for this?

04:39.080 --> 04:43.560
Comrade Admiral, it's another
burn out in the ignition sequence.

04:43.680 --> 04:46.760
Comrade Captain, l will require
the names of those responsible...

04:46.920 --> 04:49.720
l don't know. Why would l know
the name of the jackass

04:49.800 --> 04:53.280
that supplied a 30 kopeck insulator
to do a 50 kopeck job?

04:53.400 --> 04:56.480
l have to fight that
before l can fight a war.

04:56.520 --> 04:58.960
Admiral, the boat will be at sea.

05:00.360 --> 05:03.160
On schedule! Before the month is out.

05:03.240 --> 05:05.760
l'll give you a name. My name.

05:05.880 --> 05:09.280
Polenin, Mikhail! Captain, K-19.

05:09.400 --> 05:10.480
Write it down!

06:53.480 --> 06:56.560
After you've successfully
completed trials

06:56.680 --> 06:59.800
on the mechanical, propulsion and
navigation systems in the Barents sea,

06:59.880 --> 07:03.160
you'll proceed beneath the ice
to the launch area here,

07:05.440 --> 07:07.040
and test-fire the missile.

07:13.040 --> 07:17.600
My orders were to prepare K-19 for
sea trials. They'll begin on schedule.

07:17.720 --> 07:22.840
Until they're complete, to undertake
an exercise of this scope...

07:23.000 --> 07:25.600
may be, with respect,

07:26.640 --> 07:27.800
premature.

07:36.840 --> 07:38.880
There is no doubt in my mind

07:39.040 --> 07:41.320
that K-19 is ready
to fulfill her mission.

07:41.440 --> 07:45.160
Operation Arctic Circle
is no mere exercise.

07:45.280 --> 07:49.640
What is to stop the Americans
destroying Moscow and Leningrad?

07:49.760 --> 07:51.600
Only one thing...

07:53.360 --> 07:58.000
...a certain knowledge
of destruction in return.

07:59.640 --> 08:01.480
K-19 is that knowledge.

08:03.800 --> 08:08.080
But not until Kennedy is told
by his spy planes that we have it.

08:09.600 --> 08:11.200
And it works.

08:11.400 --> 08:14.240
l promised Comrade Krushchev

08:14.320 --> 08:18.520
that the American President will get
the message before the month ends.

08:18.600 --> 08:20.000
Comrade,

08:20.120 --> 08:23.880
perhaps Captain Polenin might...

08:24.000 --> 08:27.520
Captain Polenin
put his boat and men before the Party.

08:27.600 --> 08:30.160
He will be under your command.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.360
That's all there is to it.

09:18.840 --> 09:20.760
We need to reconnect
to shore supply.

09:20.880 --> 09:24.040
Reconnect to the shore supply.

09:25.120 --> 09:26.720
The Captain on the CCP.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.000
- Please.
- Captain.

09:31.120 --> 09:34.560
- What's your name, please?
- Demichev. Torpedo officer, Captain.

09:34.680 --> 09:37.600
May l ask the Captain's name
and purpose aboard our boat?

09:37.720 --> 09:41.600
My name is Vostrikov.
Where's Captain Polenin?

09:42.720 --> 09:44.480
Come in.

09:45.360 --> 09:47.680
Yes.

09:47.800 --> 09:50.840
- Morning, Captain.
- Comrade Captain Vostrikov.

09:50.960 --> 09:52.640
That'll be all, Yuri.

09:52.720 --> 09:54.880
Come in, please.

09:59.520 --> 10:00.440
Captain.

10:01.880 --> 10:03.760
With the short lead-in time
to sea trials,

10:03.880 --> 10:06.720
headquarters wanted
your expertise on board.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.120
And l'm pleased to have it.

10:09.200 --> 10:11.480
l know this could be difficult for...

10:11.560 --> 10:14.400
lt's never difficult
to do one's duty, Captain.

10:15.720 --> 10:19.680
l was preparing my briefing
on the crew and on the boat.

10:19.800 --> 10:20.960
l see.

10:21.040 --> 10:23.040
The problem is fitting her out.

10:23.160 --> 10:26.080
My orders said
you'd be arriving tomorrow.

10:26.160 --> 10:29.160
Well, the briefing can wait.
Show me the boat.

10:29.240 --> 10:30.560
Yes, of course.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.320
We're finally getting
the turbines up to speed.

10:42.480 --> 10:46.200
With luck, in another week
we might be able to run a test.

10:46.280 --> 10:49.160
The equipment has not yet arrived,
Comrade Captain.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.200
Noted, Comrade Captain.

10:58.280 --> 11:00.080
The reactor compartment.

11:16.040 --> 11:18.320
How hot are you running it?

11:18.400 --> 11:20.360
We're at 50 per cent
for the turbine test.

11:20.520 --> 11:23.840
What is the absorption rate
of the rods?

11:24.000 --> 11:26.520
Three per cent above normal.

11:29.160 --> 11:30.840
Where is the reactor officer?

11:33.760 --> 11:36.680
Lieutenant Yashin?

11:59.520 --> 12:02.880
- He's drunk. Do you tolerate this?
- Of course not.

12:03.040 --> 12:04.960
Prepare charges against this man.

12:05.040 --> 12:07.120
lnform command
we need an immediate replacement.

12:07.240 --> 12:09.760
Yes, Captain.

12:12.520 --> 12:15.360
Lieutenant Yashin is the best
reactor officer in the navy.

12:16.280 --> 12:18.200
He's never been drunk on duty before.

12:18.320 --> 12:20.640
We need him, Captain.
l urge you to reconsider.

12:22.280 --> 12:26.480
l want this boat out of dry dock.
Sea trials begin in two weeks.

12:26.560 --> 12:27.960
The boat isn't ready, Captain.

12:28.640 --> 12:29.600
The problem is Moscow.

12:29.720 --> 12:34.640
They have tours and we have
incompetent crews and broken parts.

12:34.760 --> 12:39.400
Sea trials will begin on schedule.
We deliver or we'll drown.

13:04.400 --> 13:06.880
ln the history of the Soviet Navy,

13:07.040 --> 13:13.240
no sailors have been given
such a boat as K-19.

13:15.840 --> 13:18.440
lt is the finest submarine in the world.

13:19.720 --> 13:22.560
You have been given the honor
to be her crew.

13:23.560 --> 13:25.760
l have been given the honor
to be your captain.

13:29.080 --> 13:32.000
Without me, you are nothing.

13:39.120 --> 13:43.560
Without you,
l am nothing.

13:43.640 --> 13:45.840
Much is expected of us.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.960
We will not fail.

14:30.240 --> 14:31.200
We're cursed.

14:36.720 --> 14:39.680
Easy, easy! Keep it level!

14:40.680 --> 14:43.040
Steady!
Now, down, down.

14:50.400 --> 14:52.200
Coming through. Permission to pass.

14:52.280 --> 14:55.200
- What do you have?
- A new scope for the sonar station.

14:55.280 --> 14:58.960
- Carry on. lnstall it.
- l work on the reactor, Captain.

14:59.080 --> 15:00.960
Where is the sonar officer?

15:01.080 --> 15:05.600
He's on a 24-hour pass.
Captain, l initiated the relief rotation.

15:05.680 --> 15:09.040
- lt's good for efficiency.
- No passes. All leaves are cancelled.

15:09.160 --> 15:11.400
We need everyone
to do their jobs.

15:11.520 --> 15:12.760
Yes, Captain.

15:12.800 --> 15:16.200
Comrade Captain.
Lieutenant Vadim Radtchenko.

15:16.360 --> 15:18.240
Reporting for duty.

15:19.160 --> 15:21.120
l'm your new reactor officer.

15:24.400 --> 15:25.560
- What was your last posting?
- Nuclear training academy.

15:25.560 --> 15:27.800
- What was your last posting?
- Nuclear training academy.

15:27.880 --> 15:31.240
He's never operated a reactor at sea.

15:31.360 --> 15:32.720
l was first in my class.

15:35.320 --> 15:38.200
- Report to the reactor control room.
- Yes, sir.

15:39.680 --> 15:42.240
- That way.
- Thank you.

15:43.320 --> 15:44.320
Captain...

15:44.440 --> 15:49.040
He's qualified. Or command
wouldn't have sent him to us.

15:50.880 --> 15:52.640
Officer on deck.

15:53.600 --> 15:57.080
Pavel Loktev. Senior technician.
Stepan Komarov,

15:57.200 --> 16:02.600
Anatoly Subachev, Grigori Dyomin,
Oleg Argunov.

16:02.680 --> 16:05.240
- Show me to the control room.
- Anatoly.

16:18.760 --> 16:20.560
We haven't got all day!

16:20.640 --> 16:23.000
Move it!

16:34.080 --> 16:36.680
Take it! Hurry up! Go, go!

16:45.200 --> 16:46.800
Put it there.
Easy!

16:47.640 --> 16:50.200
Watch out!
l have to stop the truck.

16:51.120 --> 16:53.360
They gave me the wrong drugs!

16:56.000 --> 16:58.840
- That goes over here!
- Stop the truck!

17:01.720 --> 17:05.960
Hey! Hey! Stop, stop!
Wrong drugs!

17:06.960 --> 17:10.040
You gave me the wrong drugs!

17:10.119 --> 17:12.119
You idiot! Stop!

17:16.760 --> 17:18.280
Help me! Help me!

17:20.200 --> 17:21.839
- Doctor!
- lt's the Doctor!

17:35.000 --> 17:36.560
He's dead.

17:38.840 --> 17:43.520
Stay till the ambulance comes.
The rest of you, back to work.

17:45.480 --> 17:46.760
Back to work!

17:52.800 --> 17:54.800
Oh, Gavril.

18:07.640 --> 18:10.200
Captain.
Since the solid ballast was loaded

18:10.320 --> 18:12.920
we've had a half-degree list to port.

18:13.040 --> 18:15.560
l've tried everything.
She won't even up.

18:16.560 --> 18:18.680
Half-degree we can handle.

18:18.800 --> 18:22.160
We'll compensate with sea water
ballast till we get back to port.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.840
lf we get back to port.

18:27.240 --> 18:30.240
You know what the men
are calling this boat?

18:30.360 --> 18:32.120
The Widowmaker.

18:32.240 --> 18:34.520
Five died from fumes
sealing the tanks.

18:34.640 --> 18:36.680
Another four in construction
and the doctor.

18:36.760 --> 18:38.480
The champagne bottle.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.960
Ten dead. And we haven't left dock.

18:43.040 --> 18:46.680
l'm surprised they confide their fears
to their commanding officer.

18:48.400 --> 18:51.640
A crew is a family.
The captain is the father.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.200
My own father inspired
more fear than he indulged.

18:58.400 --> 19:02.560
l was told there are two versions
about your father.

19:04.440 --> 19:06.800
One, he was a hero
of the Revolution.

19:06.960 --> 19:09.480
Two, he died in the Gulag.

19:10.760 --> 19:12.800
Both are true.

19:14.240 --> 19:17.840
How are those safety checks
going on down below, Captain?

19:18.000 --> 19:18.960
Proceeding.

19:25.160 --> 19:27.080
Misha. There you go.

19:27.200 --> 19:30.600
40 centimeters of headroom
and he gives half to a rodent.

19:31.480 --> 19:34.840
Yevgeny, wrap this around
your private parts.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.760
The gamma rays can...

19:38.720 --> 19:40.640
You should also take your dosimeter

19:40.760 --> 19:42.640
- once a day to the doctor.
- Why?

19:42.760 --> 19:45.800
He reads it and tells you how long
you have before your torpedo falls off.

19:57.560 --> 19:58.800
Captain?

20:01.520 --> 20:04.000
l'm Gennadi Savran.
Your new medical officer.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.480
What was your last posting?

20:05.560 --> 20:08.280
No, no. l'm the base physician here.

20:08.400 --> 20:11.520
They said there was an emergency.
So here l am.

20:11.640 --> 20:15.440
- Welcome to K-19, Doctor.
- Captain...

20:15.520 --> 20:17.480
We will be back soon?

20:17.560 --> 20:20.480
- l get...
- What?

20:20.600 --> 20:22.800
...seasick.

20:23.040 --> 20:26.680
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
Misha, please.

20:27.920 --> 20:30.800
- Vostrikov marries a girl...
- Yuri, you promised.

20:30.960 --> 20:34.000
Vostrikov marries a girl
with top Party connections.

20:34.080 --> 20:37.720
He knows which fork to use for
salad, so they make him a captain.

20:37.840 --> 20:40.960
That's why
you've never been promoted.

20:41.080 --> 20:43.920
Be quiet!
We are all good communists here.

20:45.480 --> 20:48.560
- To good communists!
- To good communists!

20:52.440 --> 20:54.000
You're drunk. Sit down!

20:54.080 --> 20:57.120
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
A little bit of respect.

20:57.240 --> 21:01.200
Captain Vostrikov does not know you
the way l do.

21:01.280 --> 21:04.160
You're still the captain
as far as we're concerned.

21:04.280 --> 21:06.480
He's the captain.
l'm executive officer.

21:06.560 --> 21:09.160
l'm pleased to be with my boys.

21:09.240 --> 21:10.200
My turn.

21:11.920 --> 21:16.840
They say another cosmonaut
orbited earth before Yuri Gagarin.

21:16.960 --> 21:21.800
But he was not loyal enough
to hold his breath

21:21.960 --> 21:25.080
when his life support system gave up.

21:25.160 --> 21:28.360
So now he never existed.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.640
Gagarin was lucky.

21:33.720 --> 21:37.080
Let's hope we are too.
To luck!

21:44.520 --> 21:45.520
Vadim!

21:52.480 --> 21:54.200

- Slow ahead together.
- Slow ahead together.

24:49.680 --> 24:52.200
- Course?
- Course is steady 3-2-3, Captain.

24:52.280 --> 24:55.640
- Depth under the keel.
- Echo sound reads 350 meters.

25:07.600 --> 25:11.120

25:30.880 --> 25:33.840
Don't worry. lt'll stop
once the pressure increases.

25:35.800 --> 25:39.480
Simulate an electrical fire
in the galley, please.

25:43.080 --> 25:46.720
Fire in switchbox number 65.
This is a drill.

25:46.760 --> 25:47.960
Repeat. This is a drill.

25:47.960 --> 25:49.000
Repeat. This is a drill.

25:57.160 --> 25:58.360
We're stuck!

25:59.720 --> 26:01.200
50 meters.

26:01.240 --> 26:04.680
Fire has spread
to the next compartment.

26:15.960 --> 26:18.400
Emergency lights!
Prepare the cable! Let's go!

26:22.840 --> 26:25.040
The fire's out in the galley, Captain.

26:26.640 --> 26:30.040
Too much damage.
Too many casualties.

26:30.640 --> 26:32.720
Simulate flooding, compartment four.

26:33.800 --> 26:35.200
Make them work in the dark.

26:49.200 --> 26:53.320
lf this were not a drill the boat would
be crippled and half the crew dead.

26:53.400 --> 26:55.440
Let me speak
to the officer in charge.

26:55.560 --> 26:57.320
Try it again tomorrow.

27:21.560 --> 27:24.160
l only wanted to say

27:24.280 --> 27:28.800
how sympathetic l am
about the change in command.

27:28.880 --> 27:33.000
These decisions are not always
for us to understand.

27:33.880 --> 27:35.720
Thank you, Comrade Suslov.

27:35.800 --> 27:41.360
Still, it's an honor to serve
in this boat in any capacity.

27:41.560 --> 27:43.360
lndeed.

27:44.560 --> 27:46.080
lt's historic.

27:49.800 --> 27:50.720
Excuse me.

27:58.200 --> 28:00.000
Checking the pressurizer?

28:00.120 --> 28:01.760
Yes, Lieutenant.

28:03.960 --> 28:05.840
You know religious icons
are forbidden?

28:08.440 --> 28:09.520
Yeah?

28:15.240 --> 28:16.720
This is the future, Pavel.

28:16.840 --> 28:19.440
Cars that never need refueling.

28:19.480 --> 28:24.480
Free power for every family.
Maybe even travel to the planets.

28:24.560 --> 28:26.960
lt's a privilege
to be a part of this future.

28:27.040 --> 28:28.880
Yes, Lieutenant.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.520
Good morning, gentlemen.

29:24.840 --> 29:27.760
- What's this?
- We only shower on Saturdays.

29:27.880 --> 29:30.640
Action stations. Chemical fire
in motor control compartment.

29:31.600 --> 29:33.280
This is a drill.

29:34.400 --> 29:35.360
Watch out!

29:42.360 --> 29:45.160
Fire in the main switchboard,
C2L.

29:45.240 --> 29:46.960
Come on, come on!

29:48.000 --> 29:49.400
Valve rupture in compartment eight.

29:52.240 --> 29:54.760
Torpedo fuel spill in aft torpedo room.

30:02.200 --> 30:03.800
Start the drill again.

30:30.520 --> 30:33.040
Comrades, officers and sailors,
remember...

30:34.080 --> 30:37.040
the American propaganda will always
play on your baser primitive instincts.

30:37.040 --> 30:38.360
the American propaganda will always
play on your baser primitive instincts.

30:39.480 --> 30:42.360
Greed, lust, individualism.

30:43.760 --> 30:47.200
ln American propaganda,
you will see how everybody has a car,

30:47.280 --> 30:49.000
nice clothes, a nice apartment.

30:49.080 --> 30:52.040
But you will never see
the truth behind this lie.

30:52.160 --> 30:55.840
You will not see police dogs attacking
demonstrators for civil rights.

30:56.040 --> 31:00.600
You will not see beggars, the
homeless, the Negro shantytowns.

31:00.720 --> 31:03.320
You will not see the warmongers

31:03.440 --> 31:05.680
who threaten the world
with nuclear holocaust.

31:10.480 --> 31:14.160
Stand by to simulate firing
torpedo number eight.

31:14.240 --> 31:18.480
- Number eight isn't loaded, Captain.
- l know that.

31:18.600 --> 31:21.280
l want you to unload seven
and load eight.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.080
- Now, please.
- Captain.

31:26.880 --> 31:28.840
lce formations near our depth.

31:29.880 --> 31:31.840
l suggest we go deeper
and run the drill later.

31:32.000 --> 31:36.640
Negative. lce formations will not be
suspended in the event of war.

31:37.280 --> 31:40.320
Unload seven torpedo.
Load eight torpedo.

31:40.400 --> 31:44.000
Unload seven torpedo.
Load eight torpedo. This is a drill.

31:45.240 --> 31:48.040
Will we ever stop?
We need the rest.

31:48.120 --> 31:49.320
Quiet!

31:49.400 --> 31:52.360
Proceed to your action stations
immediately.

31:52.440 --> 31:53.440
Come on!

31:57.200 --> 31:58.680
Gauge in gear.

31:59.440 --> 32:01.360
Torpedo withdrawn.

32:02.960 --> 32:04.400
Open number eight.

32:05.640 --> 32:06.800
Traverse torpedo!

32:10.160 --> 32:12.080
Traverse torpedo!

32:14.480 --> 32:16.720
Dimitri!
Come on, help me!

32:21.560 --> 32:22.760
Come on! Don't stop!

32:25.640 --> 32:28.200
Vasily! Vasily!

32:30.000 --> 32:31.600
Two men are injured.

32:31.720 --> 32:35.200
Have them seen by the doctor
and start the drill again.

32:35.280 --> 32:37.320
Two men short, Captain.

32:37.400 --> 32:43.120
Have them put the torpedo back
in tube seven and start the drill again.

32:46.080 --> 32:48.720
- Traverse torpedo!
- Traversing torpedo!

32:52.320 --> 32:54.720
Going under! Clear!

32:57.280 --> 32:58.520
Attention!

33:00.760 --> 33:01.960
At ease.

33:04.080 --> 33:07.280
l was told there was
some complaining.

33:08.320 --> 33:14.240
But l said, ''Not my men.
They're the best crew in the fleet.

33:14.320 --> 33:16.080
''They will pull till the last.''

33:17.000 --> 33:19.400
So...any complaints?

33:22.120 --> 33:23.640
There's no complaints here, Captain.

33:25.600 --> 33:26.560
Good.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.600
lt's not the men's fault.

33:35.280 --> 33:38.080
lt's your fault...the officers.

33:38.160 --> 33:41.560
You have failed
to set high standards,

33:41.680 --> 33:43.760
to correct their deficiencies.

33:45.760 --> 33:49.520
lf you do your job,
the men will do theirs.

33:51.600 --> 33:52.920
That is all.

34:08.560 --> 34:12.080
- What's her name?
- Katya.

34:18.440 --> 34:19.760
She's pretty.

34:21.360 --> 34:23.239
Hey.

34:25.199 --> 34:26.760
- She's pretty.
- Hey.

34:28.239 --> 34:29.199
Sorry.

34:29.320 --> 34:32.400
- l'm writing to her.
- Where will you mail it?

34:33.840 --> 34:37.560
- lt's in case l die.
- ln case you die?

34:47.760 --> 34:49.600
ln case l die.

35:18.120 --> 35:23.040
Captain, we're five miles from missile
launch area. Ahead of schedule.

35:31.760 --> 35:33.200
Good morning, gentlemen.

35:33.840 --> 35:37.080
- Course to steer, 1-8-5.
- 1-8-5.

35:41.240 --> 35:42.480
Captain.

35:44.400 --> 35:45.360
Captain.

35:46.200 --> 35:48.320
Conduct emergency dive drill.

35:48.400 --> 35:50.520
Bow planes jammed
20 degrees down.

35:50.640 --> 35:52.240
Bow planes
jammed 20 degrees down.

35:52.320 --> 35:55.400
Set 20 degrees down on the bow.

35:59.640 --> 36:01.720
Bow planes are jammed
20 degrees down.

36:01.840 --> 36:02.760
l have the conn.

36:05.640 --> 36:06.600
Move!

36:17.080 --> 36:18.960

36:24.640 --> 36:25.800
130 meters.

36:28.840 --> 36:30.600
140 meters.

36:34.200 --> 36:35.840
150 meters.

36:38.120 --> 36:41.680
Take the boat down
to maximum operational depth.

36:43.560 --> 36:49.000
Make your depth 250 meters.
Turbines slow ahead together.

37:20.520 --> 37:21.520
Thanks.

37:23.160 --> 37:24.680
240 meters.

37:27.600 --> 37:28.680
250 meters.

37:28.760 --> 37:33.080
Captain, l suggest going below
250 meters is an unnecessary risk.

37:33.160 --> 37:35.800
Continue the dive to 300 meters.

37:35.960 --> 37:39.040
300 meters is close to crush depth.

37:39.160 --> 37:41.040
l know.

37:45.560 --> 37:47.440
260 meters.

37:49.240 --> 37:51.720
Make your depth 300 meters.

38:05.640 --> 38:06.680
280 meters.

38:11.240 --> 38:12.480
290 meters.

38:23.480 --> 38:25.000
300 meters, Captain.

38:25.960 --> 38:28.840
- Level the planes!
- Level the bow planes!

38:53.800 --> 38:59.120
Simulate flooding in the aft torpedo
room and emergency surface.

38:59.240 --> 39:01.880
A rapid ascent beneath the ice cap
is not advisable, Captain.

39:03.200 --> 39:05.240
l did not ask for your advice.

39:11.560 --> 39:13.840
Flooding in compartment ten.
Emergency surface.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.440
Go, go, go!

39:17.760 --> 39:19.760

Pavel, wedge!

39:46.600 --> 39:48.520
Hold it steady! Go!

39:56.560 --> 39:58.480
Go, go, go!

40:06.320 --> 40:09.440
- The rupture is sealed, Captain.
- Excellent.

40:09.560 --> 40:11.800
l recommend we stay
at safe depth, Captain.

40:14.880 --> 40:16.600
How thick is the ice here?

40:16.720 --> 40:18.560
Kornilov? lce recon.

40:19.760 --> 40:21.080
Come on, come on.

40:21.160 --> 40:23.240
Less than one meter
in this area, Captain.

40:25.560 --> 40:27.680
These reports are almost a week old.

40:27.800 --> 40:31.120
At this time of year the ice only
gets thinner. Continue surfacing.

40:31.240 --> 40:34.240
l'm not sure if we can control
an ascent this fast, Captain.

40:35.880 --> 40:37.320
Neither am l.

41:01.280 --> 41:03.160
Pump room! Are we pumping
the trim tanks?

41:03.240 --> 41:04.440
She's rolling to port!

41:11.000 --> 41:12.400
Blow port. Shut starboard.

41:12.480 --> 41:14.200
Changing air supply.

41:14.320 --> 41:16.480

42:36.680 --> 42:38.840
Demichev! Take the conn.

42:41.280 --> 42:43.720
Raise the radio and radar masts.

42:43.840 --> 42:46.360
Give them three sweeps.
Medium range.

43:14.080 --> 43:16.000
Prepare to fire the test missile.

43:26.480 --> 43:29.040
Prepare to launch test missile.

43:29.160 --> 43:31.040
This is not a drill.

Congratulations, Comrade Captain.

46:29.320 --> 46:32.080
We just wrote our names
into the history books.

46:32.200 --> 46:35.240
- Kornilov?
- Captain.

46:35.360 --> 46:37.720
Confirm successful
missile launch to fleet command.

46:37.760 --> 46:38.840
Yes, Captain.

46:42.960 --> 46:47.200
This is the Captain.
We have launched our test missile.

46:47.280 --> 46:49.360
All hands stand down
from combat stations.

46:49.480 --> 46:51.200
Yes!

46:51.280 --> 46:52.240
Yeah!

47:02.600 --> 47:05.160
You will be in my report
for leaving your post.

47:05.280 --> 47:06.800
And you will be in mine!

47:06.880 --> 47:10.360
You endangered
this boat and its crew.

47:10.440 --> 47:13.080
200 million Soviet citizens
are depending on us,

47:13.160 --> 47:14.480
on us , Captain Vostrikov,

47:14.600 --> 47:17.400
to save them from nuclear attack.
You risked them too!

47:17.480 --> 47:20.360
l took this boat and these men
to the edge

47:20.480 --> 47:22.400
because we need to know where it is.

47:23.200 --> 47:25.320
This 120 men are a crew now

47:25.440 --> 47:28.880
because they achieved something
they did not think they could do.

47:29.000 --> 47:33.360
Next time, when it is not a drill,
they will go to the edge and past it,

47:33.480 --> 47:37.320
and die, if necessary, because that is
what their duty demands of them.

47:40.560 --> 47:42.480
You were lucky, Captain.

47:42.600 --> 47:44.160
This time.

47:44.280 --> 47:47.200
l hope l'm on another boat
when your luck runs out.

48:05.640 --> 48:07.440
Yevgeny!

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
Come on!

48:13.960 --> 48:15.160
Vasily!

48:29.000 --> 48:30.080
Maxim!

48:45.600 --> 48:48.600
Misha, Yelstin, come on, quick.
Everybody.

48:49.120 --> 48:51.160
Get that laundry out of there!

48:51.240 --> 48:53.680
All the crewmen around the flag.

48:56.040 --> 48:57.960
Get that laundry out of there!

48:58.200 --> 49:02.800
Branan, you asleep?
On the double. Get closer.

49:04.600 --> 49:05.760
Over here.

49:06.440 --> 49:07.760
Everybody, move, yes...

49:10.000 --> 49:11.280
Closer, closer.

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
Move closer!

49:15.840 --> 49:18.040
Winning team closer.

49:20.080 --> 49:22.520
Dimitri! Smile!

49:28.120 --> 49:29.480
Good.

50:09.360 --> 50:11.760
Everything all right? Problems?

50:12.840 --> 50:14.200
Er...no.

50:15.760 --> 50:17.720
No. Yes.

50:17.800 --> 50:21.600
There was residual condensation
in the reactor compartment.

50:21.720 --> 50:26.200
l shut down number three generator.
That should reduce the condensation.

50:26.320 --> 50:31.320
- l'm counting on you, you know?
- Yes, Comrade Captain.

50:32.520 --> 50:33.600
Comrade Captain.

50:35.520 --> 50:37.520
Message from command.

50:46.080 --> 50:49.600
Comrade Commander!
The crew is lined up to your order.

50:51.240 --> 50:53.200
We have received
a message from Moscow.

50:53.280 --> 50:57.320
They congratulate us on the
successful launch of our test missile.

50:57.440 --> 51:00.960
- We have proved our readiness.
- Serving the Soviet Union!

51:01.040 --> 51:03.480
And now they honor us
with a new assignment.

51:04.520 --> 51:06.920
K-19 is to assume missile patrol

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
along the eastern seaboard
of the United States.

51:09.000 --> 51:10.360
along the eastern seaboard
of the United States.

51:11.800 --> 51:15.680
This is a mission
of critical strategic importance.

51:15.800 --> 51:19.080
The boat will come
to full operational status.

51:19.200 --> 51:21.160
Do your best.

51:21.280 --> 51:23.320
l expect nothing less.

51:23.360 --> 51:25.280
Hoorah!

51:25.360 --> 51:28.040
Crew dismissed!

51:30.560 --> 51:32.600
He nearly got us killed today.

51:33.680 --> 51:37.360
And for what? To show the men
he didn't win his bars

51:37.440 --> 51:40.000
marrying a Politburo member's niece.

51:48.320 --> 51:50.400
You're still our Captain, Misha.

51:52.360 --> 51:54.520
And the only one we trust.

51:59.400 --> 52:02.280
- Captain Polenin.
- Yes.

52:02.400 --> 52:04.520
Captain Vostrikov wants
to see you in the chart room.

52:04.640 --> 52:05.760
Yes.

52:10.120 --> 52:11.760
Misha!

52:20.680 --> 52:23.920
Command wants us on station
as quickly as possible.

52:25.560 --> 52:29.480
Our course will take us past
the NATO base at Jan Mayan,

52:29.560 --> 52:34.760
and from there to our patrol zone,
400 kilometers off the coastline,

52:34.920 --> 52:36.400
between Washington...

52:37.920 --> 52:39.760
...and New York.

52:45.760 --> 52:48.920
- Make turns for 15 knots.
- Speed 15 knots.

52:49.000 --> 52:50.920
Speed 15 knots.

52:54.600 --> 52:57.720
- No contact. Down scope.
- Periscope going down!

53:01.400 --> 53:03.080
Dive the boat.

53:25.160 --> 53:27.040
Andrei, more wine!

53:27.120 --> 53:28.600
You only get one glass.

53:28.720 --> 53:31.360
But because
we're the créme de la créme,

53:31.480 --> 53:32.720
a glass of red wine with dinner

53:32.800 --> 53:38.360
is the headquaters' way of telling us
that the K-19's crew has no equal.

53:38.440 --> 53:41.480
No, it's because
we're sitting on a pile of uranium.

53:41.600 --> 53:47.560
Red wine gives you strontium.
Or takes it away. Or something.

53:47.640 --> 53:48.720
Something good.

54:08.840 --> 54:14.960
We should be 70 miles
from Jan Mayan NATO base.

54:16.320 --> 54:21.400
One mountain. No trees.
Fifteen men, one radio station.

54:21.480 --> 54:23.720
l've seen that island
many times.

54:56.120 --> 54:57.720
- Misha.
- Yevgeny.

55:03.640 --> 55:04.920
What's the matter?

55:07.560 --> 55:13.040
l miss seeing the trees,
seeing the sun, the stars.

55:13.160 --> 55:15.400
You'll get used to being underwater.

55:17.520 --> 55:22.560
When l muster out, l'll just work
in the coal mine with my brothers.

55:27.920 --> 55:29.840
So it's all the same to me.

56:15.040 --> 56:16.680
A loss of pressure in
the primary circuit on the aft reactor.

56:16.760 --> 56:19.080
Check the other sensors.

56:23.480 --> 56:25.400
Confirm loss of pressure, Lieutenant.

56:31.320 --> 56:33.320
Let me through. Watch out!

56:33.400 --> 56:34.400
We've got a leak!

56:34.520 --> 56:36.520
Get me the emergency manual!

56:37.600 --> 56:39.280
Come on!

56:40.400 --> 56:43.440
l noticed the pumps were drawing too
much power during the turbine tests.

56:43.520 --> 56:46.040
But l didn't think it was serious.

56:51.760 --> 56:53.440
Out of my way!

56:53.520 --> 56:55.440
Move!

57:00.880 --> 57:03.120
The control rods
are dropping, Lieutenant.

57:04.760 --> 57:07.160
- Auxiliary pumps.
- Pavel, auxiliary pumps!

57:11.240 --> 57:13.840
- They aren't working.
- Recycle them!

57:13.960 --> 57:15.880
l have.
But pressure's dropping.

57:17.560 --> 57:18.800
Confirm.

57:18.880 --> 57:21.360
But the rods will cool it, right?

57:21.480 --> 57:25.680
No! They can't control the reaction
by themselves. They need coolant.

57:25.760 --> 57:28.680
Lieutenant, the core temperature
is at 400 degrees and rising!

57:28.760 --> 57:30.600
Cut the equalization!

57:45.320 --> 57:46.960
What's the problem?

57:47.040 --> 57:49.200
The primary coolant loop
on the aft reactor is ruptured.

57:49.320 --> 57:52.880
- What? How did this happen?
- What difference does it make?

57:53.040 --> 57:56.120
- Answer me. How did this happen?
- l don't know. The core is heating up.

57:56.200 --> 58:00.720
- The mission's over.
- l'll tell you when the mission is over.

58:00.800 --> 58:02.480
Who's responsible for this?
l want a name.

58:02.560 --> 58:04.880
l'll give you a name.
Vostrikov, Alexei.

58:06.080 --> 58:07.280
Watch yourself, Comrade.

58:07.400 --> 58:10.200
And here's another name.
Radtchenko, Vadim.

58:10.240 --> 58:12.840
The untested reactor officer
you put on this boat.

58:26.760 --> 58:31.160
We will fix this problem.
We will continue the mission.

58:36.360 --> 58:39.640
- Surface. Surface the boat!
- Surface the boat!

58:56.680 --> 59:00.360
- How bad is it?
- The leak is in the sealed area.

59:02.320 --> 59:03.960
There's no way to get to it.

59:05.880 --> 59:09.360
The temperature will keep rising
till it reaches 1 ,000 degrees.

59:09.480 --> 59:12.040
- And...
- And?

59:13.600 --> 59:14.600
And what?

59:15.520 --> 59:17.840
No one knows.

59:18.400 --> 59:22.200
lt could start a chain reaction.
There would be radiation leakage,

59:22.280 --> 59:27.280
the core would melt the reactor
and start a thermonuclear explosion.

59:34.680 --> 59:37.880
- How long do we have?
- Three or four hours.

59:38.760 --> 59:40.680
lt could be less.

59:45.960 --> 59:51.760
Get whoever you need,
regardless of rank, and solve this.

59:51.840 --> 59:55.480
- Yes, Comrade Captain.
- Solve this!

59:55.600 --> 59:57.360
That's why you're here,
you understand?

59:57.880 --> 01:00:00.240
Get up!

01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:02.240
Get up!

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:08.080
Doesn't he ever get tired of drills?

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:09.640
Let's go! Let's go!

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:27.320
This is the Captain.

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:30.160
We've had a malfunction
in the aft reactor.

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:33.720
Measures are being taken
to correct the situation.

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:37.480
Remain at your stations.

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:44.000
Read it again.

01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:47.360
''ln case of sudden drop
in the pressure of the primary circuit

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:50.520
''measures must be taken to reduce
precipitation heat release.''

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:54.520
But this doesn't work.
Reflux valve isn't here.

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:58.000
- What measures?
- There are no measures. lt's useless.

01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:00.120
The rest is about the backup system
which was never installed.

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:03.520
When we reached periscope depth
we need to speak to fleet command.

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:04.840
Yes, Comrade Captain.

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.800
Why can't we just
shut the reactor down?

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:22.080
We have shut it down, but we can't
control the reaction anymore.

01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:26.360
Suppose we use the forward reactor.
Cross-connect its pumps.

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:28.680
Use them to cool both.

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:32.120
The rupture is not accessible
so we can't seal the leak.

01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:34.520
And we'd have two reactors
out of control.

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:38.800
So...we still have to cool down
the reactor.

01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:42.640
- Permission to speak, Lieutenant.
- Of course.

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:47.440
The coolant is just distilled water.

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:52.560
We have 30 tones
of fresh water on board.

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:56.280
Yes. But, how do we get it
to the core?

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:57.480
Pass the schematic.

01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:36.520
Kornilov. l need contact
with fleet command. Now.

01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:37.880
Still trying, Captain.

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:41.760
The air release pipe can deliver
coolant deep enough to the core.

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:45.000
We can hack off the valve and pump
in the fresh water supply.

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:47.000
We've got 30 tones, Captain.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
There are some high grade pipes
in the torpedoes.

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:52.480
lt's not much to weld.
Thirty minutes at the most.

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:56.400
- And if we can't fix it?
- Hiroshima.

01:02:56.520 --> 01:03:00.720
1 .4 megatons including
the two reactors and the warheads.

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:02.760
Hiroshima was less, it was a lot less.

01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:05.840
Scuttle the boat.
Get the men off in rafts.

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:15.320
We'll not abandon this boat.
Scavenge the pipes.

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:18.760
We'll be ready when authorization
comes through. Let's go.

01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:44.840
- Have you reached fleet command?
- No, Comrade Captain.

01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:50.520
Captain, the long-range antenna
feeder has shorted out.

01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:52.800
The seal must have ruptured
when we submerged.

01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:58.280
What's the range of the emergency
transmitters? 90 kilometers?

01:03:58.360 --> 01:03:59.520
Up to 100 kilometers, Captain.

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:02.120
Core temperature at 490 degrees.

01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:17.600
That's it. Take it, Dimitri.

01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:24.760
l'll take it, Captain.

01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:29.840
Make sure no debris
gets into the pipes.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.440
Lay out the piping in straight runs.

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:36.680
- Where is the hacksaw?
- May l have your attention?

01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:38.960
Men, listen!

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:47.640
The reactor unit will affect the
repairs. You will go in teams of two.

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:50.560
- Ten minutes inside, maximum.
- l will go in the first team.

01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:54.080
No, l need my executive officer
to command.

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:56.760
- Yes, but under these circumstances.
- l am aware of the circumstances!

01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:58.080
lt's out of the question.

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:00.760
l'll go in the first team.

01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:07.560
- lt's my duty.
- l am ready to serve, Captain.

01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:14.440
Vadim. Vadim!

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:21.560
You will go in with the third team
to inspect the repair.

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:24.360
Yes, Comrade Captain.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.200
That is all. Carry on.

01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:50.840
Quick! Get something!
Quick!

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.760
- Fuel spill!
- Fuel spill in aft torpedo!

01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:06.840
Chief? Toolbox.

01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:15.080
Feed water system isolated!

01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:18.800
- Vent off the feed water tank!
- l've got three more meters here!

01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:23.920
Meat...

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:27.600
Just beef, falling off the bone.

01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:31.720
Nice and tender. Melts in your mouth.

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:34.280
- Dumplings.
- Dumplings? Dimitri likes...

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:36.920
Hey, Dimitri likes dumplings.

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:42.960
Reactor temperature?

01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:45.000
530 degrees.

01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:49.520
- Vasily! How long?
- l'd say about 15 minutes, Captain.

01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:50.800
Good work!

01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:54.560
- Comrade Captain.
- Yes.

01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:56.320
Our equipment is prepared
and we're standing by to enter.

01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:59.160
We have a few minutes.
Take the men up top. Get some air.

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:00.480
Thank you.

01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:02.160
You heard him. Get some air.

01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:06.760
Lieutenant.

01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:09.800
Go on.

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:11.320
l was getting married.

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:16.600
You will. You will.

01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:26.760
Your hair falls out
or something like that.

01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:30.960
- lt won't be that bad.
- Ten minutes is nothing.

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:35.440
An hour later and our watch
would have been over.

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:40.960
lt's fate.

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:51.480
We don't have radiation suits?

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:54.440
The warehouse was out.
They sent chemical suits instead.

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:57.800
- They might as well wear raincoats!
- Misha, l know.

01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:10.040
- Tell the men these will help.
- What else can we do?

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:24.680
lt's only ten minutes. Ten minutes.
Do what you can and get out?

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:25.840
All right, Anatoly?

01:08:28.279 --> 01:08:30.319
Okay? Good.

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:36.640
You'll be fine.

01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:39.120
Captain.

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.439
Men...

01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:50.000
this difficult task has fallen to you.

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:54.520
Our fate is in your hands.

01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:57.600
Request permission to carry out
reactor repair, Captain.

01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:59.600
Permission granted.

01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:04.399
May God be with you.

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:57.040
What's the core temperature?

01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:00.960
725 degrees.

01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:16.960
Entering airlock.

01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:47.720
Come on, Anatoly. Easy.

01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:51.720
How is it in there?

01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:59.360
Doctor. Take them to bow torpedo.

01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:02.320
Keep them as far away
from the radiation as possible.

01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:11.720
- How do you feel?
- lt's all right.

01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:38.880
Good. Give me his dosimeter.

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:56.880
- His radiation level is low, yes?
- Yes, of course.

01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:01.160
Report to me on their condition
in an hour.

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:07.200
Good news, Anatoly.
You got a mild dose.

01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:12.200
All right. All right. Gently.

01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:15.520
- lt's time.
- Comrades, it's time.

01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:17.440
Put your mask on.

01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:21.160
Hey, hey, come on, let's go.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.200
Ten minutes. Look at me.

01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:29.760
Come on, wake up.

01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:34.320
Vadim! lt's time to go!

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:38.240
Go, go.

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:44.720
lt's all right.

01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:54.520
Chief.

01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:35.600
Chief Gorelov's gone in his place.

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:38.760
Good boy.

01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:00.800
Captain.

01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:02.280
You sent for me?

01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:04.280
Yes.

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:09.040
We won't fire any missiles. Do you
know how to take radiation readings?

01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:10.320
Yes, Comrade Captain.

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:13.000
l want readings
from all compartments.

01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:16.640
Yes, Captain.

01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:53.000
- Temperature?
- 925 degrees.

01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:57.240
How long?

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.880
Seven minutes 40 seconds.

01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:20.200
Easy, easy.

01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:22.480
Sit him down.

01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:24.800
Chief!

01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:27.600
Chief?

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:35.280
- Gorelov?
- Yes. Konstantin's getting him.

01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:41.560
He's getting him.
You did good. You did good.

01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:46.600
He's getting him.

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:50.720
Yes, yes.

01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:11.080
lt's flowing.

01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:14.520
lt's flowing.
The coolant is flowing.

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:19.800
Tell the Captain the coolant is flowing.

01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:26.000
You did it.

01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:27.480
Oleg, you did it.

01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:30.760
Chief!

01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:47.160
You did it, my boy.
You did it, my boy.

01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:50.240
You did it.
Yeah, you showed them.

01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:56.720
You showed them.
Easy, easy.

01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:09.080
Kornilov? Give him a hand.
Gently, gently.

01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:14.160
- Come on.
- l'll help you, mate.

01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:26.640
Captain!

01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:31.360
950! 930. lt's dropping.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.040
920.

01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:35.680
910.

01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:37.960
900.

01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:55.480
- Captain.
- Chief.

01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:21.200
850.

01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:28.760
830.

01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:31.000
800.

01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:42.360
This is the Captain. The reactor
appears to be under control.

01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:49.760
Our thanks to Chief Engineer Gorelov,
and the third watch reactor unit.

01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:52.560
For a job well done.

01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:57.200
Rest, boy.

01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:05.400
- Ship's head?
- 2-2-0, Captain.

01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:17.200
Turn the boat around.
Come to a heading of 0-4-0.

01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:23.480
Forward motor.
Slow ahead.

01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:27.480
Starboard 30. Course 0-4-0.

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:29.400
Forward motor. Slow ahead.

01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:32.640
Starboard 30.
Steering the course 0-4-0.

01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:37.600
Back to base?

01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:42.360
With a speed of 5 knots.
lt'll take days.

01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:44.440
We shall be a ghost ship.

01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:36.720
Captain. The men are hungry.

01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:42.080
The food is contaminated. Give them
whatever you have in tins or foil.

01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:45.560
Give them red wine to slow
the rate of radiation absorption.

01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:47.320
Very well, Captain.

01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:54.120
Captain. ln here
it's only five units.

01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:56.720
But in the reactor room
is ten times that.

01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:00.840
Turn off the ventilation system.

01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:04.280
All compartments
shut down main ventilation.

01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:06.240
Captain, if we...

01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:08.800
We will run the boat
with skeleton crews.

01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:12.080
Put most of the men on top, as far
away from the radiation as possible.

01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:15.440
We're 160 kilometers
from the NATO base in Jan Mayan.

01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:18.760
We could go there.
Get help from the Americans.

01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:19.960
Under no circumstances

01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:22.680
will l abandon
my boat or my crew to the enemy.

01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:25.760
May l ask then, what is your plan?

01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:35.840
We're out of radio contact.
lf we stay on our course,

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.440
fleet command
will send the diesels to find us.

01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:40.560
Radiation levels are rising too fast.

01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:44.560
We're just running on electric motors.
There's no time for that.

01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:46.560
They will find us.

01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:50.440
As usual the Captain leaves
no room for doubt.

01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:26.520
Good.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.520
Dimitri.

01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:33.400
You're fine.

01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:43.720
Good.
You're fine, Yevgeny.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.840
Next.

01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:52.040
Good, yes. Excellent.

01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:13.720
lcons...

01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:16.160
are forbidden.

01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:31.200
Contact. Bearing 0-1-5.
Range 2,000 meters, Captain.

01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:54.240
Wait. Wait.

01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:56.000
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:10.440
They're Americans.

01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:16.320
Captain?

01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:21.400
The jackals have found us.
lt's an American destroyer.

01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:23.440
Captain?

01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:27.080
The Americans are contacting us
on the emergency band.

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:29.440
The helicopters reported
our men on deck.

01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:31.480
The captain is offering assistance.

01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:35.760
Tell them we don't need assistance.
We're just getting some air.

01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:44.800
- What are they doing?
- Taking pictures of us.

01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:52.480
Hey! Hey, spies!

01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:53.560
Take a look at this.

01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:00.320
- Take a look at this!
- Everybody.

01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:14.720
Look at this lovely butt!

01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:24.280
Hey, where are you going?

01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:31.800
Offering assistance.

01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:35.120
They want this boat.
What a victory that would be.

01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:38.120
The waters here are over a mile deep.

01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:40.720
We could get the men off. Scuttle
the boat. They'd have to take us.

01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:44.440
Captain Polenin's right. We have
life rafts. We can save everyone.

01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:48.720
Scuttle the flagship of the fleet?

01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:50.680
Present my crew
to the Americans for interrogation.

01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:53.520
Your duty now is clear.
You must save their lives.

01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:55.960
My duty is to defend the state.

01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:57.800
l will do that
to my last dying breath.

01:28:57.920 --> 01:28:59.760
You're defending nothing
but your own ambition.

01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:03.440
Tell that to the men who are dying.
Come on, tell them!

01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:13.000
There will be no more talk
of surrendering to the Americans.

01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:16.840
lt is treason. Say it again
and l will confine you to your quarters.

01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:20.720
And you...you are the Commissar,
representative of the party.

01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:22.480
- Responsible for crew morale.
- Yes, Captain.

01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:25.640
Then act like it. The crew needs you
to show courage not fear.

01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:27.640
- Fear is contagious.
- Yes, Captain.

01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:33.840
- Kornilov.
- Yes, Captain.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:37.080
Stop monitoring the Americans.
They are the enemy.

01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:38.120
Yes, Captain.

01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:08.600
Help me.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.480
Please.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:19.760
How are the men?

01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:21.720
How would l know?

01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:24.360
l don't know
about radiation sickness.

01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:26.320
Please.

01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:29.800
l'm giving them aspirin.

01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:32.120
l'm trying to prevent
those that are dying

01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:35.240
from irradiating those of us
that still have some hope.

01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:39.440
Pull yourself together.
You are an officer in the Soviet Navy.

01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:50.240
Go back and tell them
that they're improving.

01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:53.680
As you say, you know nothing
about radiation sickness.

01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:55.400
Perhaps they are.

01:30:57.160 --> 01:30:58.840
- Captain?
- Yes.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:02.480
Readings are rising
in every compartment now.

01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:08.320
Misha?

01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:23.280
- Comrade Suslov.
- What is it?

01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:28.240
The radiation
is going to kill us all.

01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:31.520
The political branch
gives you the authority

01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:33.480
to approve any change of command.

01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:36.440
Only in extreme cases
of dereliction of duty.

01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:41.000
Which this is. He's suffering
from radiation poisoning himself.

01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:45.040
His judgment is impaired
or he would get the men off the boat.

01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:50.840
When the moment comes

01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:53.000
we will know it.

01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:01.840
The weld is giving way!

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:05.960
- Core temperature 450 and rising!
- Captain!

01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:07.880
The reactor repair has failed.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:12.000
- Captain!
- Core temperature 450 and rising!

01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:24.400
This is the Captain.
All hands below decks.

01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:26.840
Prepare for emergency descent.

01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:42.640
All hands below! All hands below!
Diving stations! Diving Stations!

01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:45.800
Get the bulkhead doors shut!

01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:50.400
l am not going back down!
l am not going down!

01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:53.240
All hands to diving stations.
Move, move! Come on!

01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:56.600
We have to go now! Andrei!

01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:01.240
Andrei, no!
What are you doing?

01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:03.720
Diving now! Diving now!

01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:06.680
Move! Get in!

01:34:06.760 --> 01:34:10.480
- No, Andrei!
- Get in the hatch! lt's an order! Move!

01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:13.520
We can't leave him,
he'll never make it!

01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:17.120
Are the Americans still offering
assistance on the emergency band?

01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:20.080
- The Captain said not to...
- Check.

01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:25.080
They're still there.

01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:28.680
Why is he diving?
He's going to cook us.

01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:34.320
- No, l won't go!
- Yevgeny!

01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:39.120
Prepare the tank! Quickly!

01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:48.040
Give it to me!

01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:08.960
- Come on, let's go.
- This is bullshit! Put me down!

01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:21.840
Fire in aft torpedo!

01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:36.760
Aft torpedo! Dimitri? Vasily?

01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:39.680
- Report!
- Fire in aft torpedo.

01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:42.360
We have no communication.
Our fire team is suiting up.

01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:45.080
- Activate fire suppression.
- That would kill everybody in there.

01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:48.240
lf torpedoes go off, it'll kill
everyone. They have breathing kits.

01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:50.800
They don't. We took the oxygen
for the reactor team.

01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:53.240
- Give the fire team some time.
- Activate the system.

01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:56.720
The primary wasn't connected.
lt must be activated locally.

01:35:56.800 --> 01:35:59.400
Go to nine and turn on the system.

01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:04.040
You refuse my order?

01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:07.080
l'll do it myself.

01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:11.800
lf you leave the command center,
l will get help from the Americans

01:36:11.880 --> 01:36:13.520
and you will be in no position
to stop me.

01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:21.840
lf we can't handle it.
l'll switch on the suppression system.

01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:29.280
Get the fire out. Quickly!

01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:31.320
Why aren't we diving?

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.080
Under the authority
given to me by the Party

01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:38.760
you are hereby removed
from your post for dereliction of duty.

01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:54.840
lsolate electrical!

01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:58.800
You're wasting time.
Get a team to repair the reactor.

01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:25.520
- Torpedo number eight!
- Torpedo number eight!

01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:31.280
Stop the water!

01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:41.160
Kornilov. Tell the Americans
we're evacuating the submarine

01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:42.880
and will require assistance.

01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:47.720
Send the message!

01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:57.200
US destroyer.
This is Soviet submarine. Over.

01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:18.560
Comrade Admiral.

01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:23.280
General Vershinin, KGB.

01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:29.600
l want to know
if your man Vostrikov is a traitor.

01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:32.480
All we know is that K-19
has broken off radio contact.

01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:34.360
Broken radio contact with us.

01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:40.400
A reconnaissance plane has spotted
a destroyer shadowing K-19.

01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:44.960
An American destroyer.

01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:55.160
Vasily?

01:38:57.440 --> 01:38:58.840
Vasily.

01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:03.360
Captain Polenin
to central command.

01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:06.960
Repeat. Captain Polenin
to central command.

01:39:07.480 --> 01:39:09.400
Captain Polenin to central command.

01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:12.440
Repeat. Captain Polenin
to central command.

01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:14.840
- 575 degrees and rising.
- Shut up!

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.760
You have no idea
what you're doing.

01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:18.320
Easy, easy.

01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:20.080
- Who is it?
- lt's Dimitri.

01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:24.360
Captain Polenin to central command.

01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:27.640
- Captain Polenin!
- Do what you can, Vanya.

01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:30.200
Central command. lmmediately!

01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:36.160
- Five men have...
- Captain Polenin.

01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:39.480
l have exercised my authority
to transfer the boat to your command.

01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:51.280
You're our captain
and always have been.

01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:54.640
We've contacted the Americans.

01:39:54.720 --> 01:39:57.640
All we need is your order
to abandon the ship.

01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:14.280
Good.

01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:18.480
Good.

01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:22.360
Weapons don't belong here.
Give them to me.

01:40:23.480 --> 01:40:25.280
Give me the gun.

01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:28.600
And the key for the handcuffs.
Come on.

01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:34.120
- Give it to me. This boat's a family.
- Of course, Captain.

01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:36.720
And the key for the handcuffs.

01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:39.240
- Suslov?
- Captain.

01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:42.080
You betray your family.

01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:45.960
You betray me.

01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:48.520
You're under arrest.

01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:50.800
- What?
- Both of you. Get out of my sight.

01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:53.560
Take the gun!
Lock them in their quarters! Move!

01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:57.440
lt is treason.
Misha! Misha!

01:40:57.520 --> 01:40:59.680
The fire in compartment ten
has been extinguished.

01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:01.960
The suppression system
was not required.

01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:04.160
Unfortunately,
there was only one survivor.

01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:07.600
Thank you.

01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:11.040
- Captain.
- Captain.

01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:12.920
We have to dive.

01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:17.000
This is the Captain.

01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:24.520
Don't order them, Captain.

01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:26.200
Ask them.

01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:36.440
This is the Captain.

01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:40.480
Our situation is desperate.

01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:43.640
The reactor repair has failed.

01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:47.000
At any moment
we could have an explosion

01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:49.480
which could set off the warheads.

01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:54.160
This would destroy
the American ship, only...

01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:59.720
a few kilometers
from the NATO base.

01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:05.160
Given the current level of tensions
between our countries,

01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:12.080
this could result in horrifying
retaliatory attacks on the motherland.

01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:20.680
We...we could dive
and attempt to repair the reactor,

01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:24.080
but there are no guarantees.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:27.760
l am standing by.

01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:41.680
Secure both bulkhead doors.

01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:56.840
Compartment ten isolated.

01:42:56.960 --> 01:42:59.000
Compartment nine clear of smoke.

01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:01.280
Manned and ready.

01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:06.320
Compartment eight, serving
the Soviet Union, Comrade Captain.

01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:10.520
Compartment seven, standing by
to do our duty, Captain.

01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:12.960
Compartment five, manned and ready.

01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:16.440
Compartment four,
we await your orders, Captain.

01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:20.280
Compartment one,
we are with you, Captain.

01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:22.320
Ready to dive, Captain.

01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:24.840
- Dive the boat.
- Dive the boat!

01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:27.600
Make her depth 300 meters.
Keep five degrees.

01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:30.520
- Flood all main ballasts.
- Flood all main ballasts!

01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:33.080
Electric motors full ahead together.

01:43:33.200 --> 01:43:36.400
- Full ahead together!
- Keep five degrees bow down.

01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:04.160
Radtchenko.
Lieutenant Radtchenko.

01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:09.040
Lieutenant Radtchenko. Report.

01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:28.280
Captain.

01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:31.640
Reactor temperature
is 760 degrees and rising.

01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:44.080
Lieutenant Radtchenko.

01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:46.360
Vadim.

01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:49.360
- Where is he?
- He's inside.

01:44:56.960 --> 01:44:58.920
How long has he been in there?

01:45:00.440 --> 01:45:03.240
- 18 minutes.
- 18.

01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:09.280
- Captain! You can't go in...
- Secure the hatch!

01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:30.960
Vadim!

01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:35.120
l can't see! l can't see!

01:45:36.280 --> 01:45:38.720
Captain. l'm sorry.

01:45:49.720 --> 01:45:51.560
Open the hatch!

01:45:56.680 --> 01:46:00.000
- 280 meters.
- Level off.

01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:23.160
Coming through.

01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:25.520
970 degrees and holding, Captain.

01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:27.520
Open the bulkhead door!

01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:31.720
He got a terrible dose.

01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:33.840
Who's going in next?

01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:38.240
Captain. The temperature's falling.

01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:42.960
He did it.
He turned himself into a hero.

01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:44.560
Surface the boat!

01:46:46.520 --> 01:46:50.040
Blow the main ballast! Rise the
planes. Keep 15 degrees by the bow.

01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:52.480
Motors at full ahead together.

01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:56.440
- You have the conn.
- Full raise. 15 degrees by the bow.

01:46:56.560 --> 01:46:58.480
l have the conn.

01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:03.560
Signal the American Captain
as soon as we surface.

01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:08.080
Tell him we require his assistance.

01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:14.160
- Yes, Captain.
- Yes, Captain.

01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:21.200
- Up periscope!
- Periscope going up!

01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:35.840
Men...

01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:41.000
you have done your duty
for the motherland.

01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:45.080
The Party is proud of you.

01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:47.680
l am...

01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:50.520
l am proud of you.

01:47:54.280 --> 01:47:55.560
Captain?

01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:57.520
Captain?

01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:02.000
Yes, Vadim. l'm here.

01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:04.760
The weld, is it holding?

01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:07.760
Yes, Vadim.

01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:09.720
The weld is holding.

01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:16.320
You're a hero, Vadim. Do you hear?

01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:20.280
You're a hero.

01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:30.120
You are all...

01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:34.440
all of you...

01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:36.160
heroes.

01:48:55.800 --> 01:48:59.560
l had hoped one of our boats
would find us.

01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:06.640
But the radiation levels
are rising too quickly.

01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:14.080
l have asked the American captain...

01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:17.840
for his help.

01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:31.640
Prepare to abandon the boat.

01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:46.280
American destroyer. Bearing 0-4-5.
Range 2,000 meters.

01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:53.320
Captain, l have a contact!

01:49:54.320 --> 01:49:56.680
- What the...?
- Captain!

01:49:58.120 --> 01:50:02.120
- The boat could be in trouble.
- What sort of trouble?

01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:05.560
l've known Captain Vostrikov
personally for half his life.

01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:10.360
There isn't a submariner in the navy
whose loyalty l trust more.

01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:12.720
More than his father's loyalty?

01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:18.520
l never knew his father.

01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:28.520
Captain!

01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:30.720
Captain!

01:50:34.640 --> 01:50:37.600
When my father went to sea

01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:41.760
he used to carry these great handfuls
of dirt in his pockets.

01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:44.400
A bit of the motherland, he said.

01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:51.160
He would rather die
than betray his country.

01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:55.280
Contact me from the bridge
when the last lifeboat is loaded.

01:50:55.400 --> 01:50:58.120
l'll sink the boat.
The Americans won't get her.

01:50:58.200 --> 01:51:01.200
That won't be necessary, Captain.

01:51:01.320 --> 01:51:05.280
Our submarine S270 has found us.

01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:29.240
Yes.

01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:39.360
Confirm and out.

01:51:41.480 --> 01:51:44.680
Reply from Moscow, Captain,
sent through S270.

01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:50.080
Your request to remove the men
from the boat is denied, Captain.

01:51:52.480 --> 01:51:55.240
They're sending a freighter
to tow us back to base.

01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:00.400
Anything else?

01:52:02.600 --> 01:52:04.880
They said...

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:08.200
they said to give the men
plenty of fresh fruit.

01:52:11.880 --> 01:52:16.200
l want my men off this boat.
l am countermanding Moscow.

01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:19.120
You know that will be
the end of your career?

01:52:21.880 --> 01:52:25.800
They'll send you to the Gulag.
Like your father.

01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:31.360
Well, it's a family tradition, isn't it?

01:52:45.040 --> 01:52:47.320
Let's go. Let's go.

01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:13.760
Come on.

01:53:18.440 --> 01:53:19.400
Easy.

01:53:21.680 --> 01:53:23.560
Good. Good.

01:53:25.120 --> 01:53:26.840
You must be decontaminated,
you understand?

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:28.960
We must make you clean.

01:53:29.080 --> 01:53:31.160
lt's cold but you'll be warmer inside.

01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:34.480
You must take your clothes off.
We will decontaminate you.

01:53:34.560 --> 01:53:37.280
and destroy the clothes.
Then you can go down below.

01:53:37.400 --> 01:53:38.560
- Take off your pants.
- Next!

01:53:40.120 --> 01:53:41.720
Easy.

01:53:59.640 --> 01:54:01.440
Be careful there!

01:54:01.560 --> 01:54:03.760
This is your boat, Misha.

01:54:03.880 --> 01:54:08.000
l lost my position, Yuri,
but not my self-respect.

01:54:08.120 --> 01:54:09.760
You lost both.

01:54:17.880 --> 01:54:22.040
- Where am l going?
- They're taking you across, Vadim.

01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:24.240
l need my picture of Katya.

01:54:24.760 --> 01:54:28.080
- Where is it?
- ln my pocket.

01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:31.960
Here you are.

01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:34.560
There it is.

01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:41.960
l can't see!

01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:44.360
l can't see her!

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.560
All men accounted for, Captain.

01:55:10.360 --> 01:55:13.680
Why didn't you take command
when you had the chance?

01:55:17.080 --> 01:55:21.240
Because what they did was wrong.

01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:27.560
Prepare the tow, Captain.

01:55:27.640 --> 01:55:28.840
Captain.

01:55:37.680 --> 01:55:39.760
Get all these men up! Move!

01:55:43.400 --> 01:55:45.800
Lev, you're a welcome sight!

01:55:45.920 --> 01:55:48.120
Moscow said you were defecting
with your boat.

01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:50.280
- What?
- They want a list of the men

01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:52.120
fit enough to testify.

01:55:52.200 --> 01:55:54.520
Testify? About what?

01:55:56.640 --> 01:55:57.640
About you.

01:56:01.400 --> 01:56:04.520
- Alexei.
- Make sure all the lines are secure!

01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:07.960
- Come on, you're going home.
- Thank you, Doctor. We did it.

01:56:08.080 --> 01:56:10.120
We're going home.

01:56:15.480 --> 01:56:17.360
Let's go home.

01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:30.480
At every stage of this disaster,

01:56:30.520 --> 01:56:33.400
which came within moments
of being a far greater disaster,

01:56:33.480 --> 01:56:36.720
the officers and crew did
what had to be done.

01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:39.280
Seven are now dead.

01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:43.440
And nobody knows how many more
are dying or how fast.

01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:46.640
These are the men
who returned home to be interrogated

01:56:46.720 --> 01:56:48.800
as if a crime had been committed.

01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:53.200
Questioned, even while undergoing
treatment for radiation poisoning.

01:56:53.320 --> 01:56:57.360
Locked up and denied access
to wives and families.

01:56:57.440 --> 01:57:01.120
But they and their comrades
saved K-19.

01:57:01.240 --> 01:57:02.520
And maybe...

01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:05.760
just maybe...they saved
all of you as well.

01:57:05.920 --> 01:57:07.720
Thank you, Captain Polenin.

01:57:07.800 --> 01:57:09.360
- One thing more, please.
- Thank you.

01:57:09.440 --> 01:57:12.200
No captain in the Soviet Navy

01:57:12.320 --> 01:57:14.520
has ever been faced
with such decisions.

01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:17.080
The fate of the boat, the crew...

01:57:17.200 --> 01:57:19.760
the fate of the world.

01:57:19.920 --> 01:57:22.720
All in the balance.

01:57:24.760 --> 01:57:26.760
The navy is my life.

01:57:28.120 --> 01:57:31.840
And one thing l know. There can be
only one captain of a ship.

01:57:33.040 --> 01:57:38.040
The burden of command
is on his shoulders and his alone.

01:57:43.480 --> 01:57:45.120
None of you...

01:57:46.080 --> 01:57:49.680
none of you has the right
to judge Captain Vostrikov.

01:57:49.800 --> 01:57:51.920
You weren't there.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:53.440
l was.

01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:56.240
He was our captain.

01:57:58.240 --> 01:58:00.600
He was my captain.

01:58:08.200 --> 01:58:12.760
And it would be an honor
to sail under his command again.

01:58:25.120 --> 01:58:27.080
East Germany has agreed to do

01:58:27.200 --> 01:58:30.760
what the west has been demanding
for more than a generation.

01:58:35.920 --> 01:58:37.800
After opening up the Berlin wall

01:58:37.920 --> 01:58:40.280
the government announced
it will hold democratic elections.

01:58:40.280 --> 01:58:41.240
the government announced
it will hold democratic elections.

02:00:01.960 --> 02:00:04.280
You're not so tall as l remember.

02:00:04.360 --> 02:00:05.600
lt's good to see you.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:09.600
And you.

02:00:10.560 --> 02:00:12.440
Please.

02:00:17.280 --> 02:00:19.560
l'm glad you found me.

02:00:20.640 --> 02:00:24.400
But today was, in fact,
not very convenient.

02:00:24.480 --> 02:00:27.000
No, no. lt had to be today.

02:00:39.120 --> 02:00:41.080
Your crew.

02:00:43.520 --> 02:00:46.000
lt was 28 years ago today.

02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:41.280
Captain. A toast.

02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:47.840
To the men still on patrol.

02:01:54.400 --> 02:01:57.600
For their courage
l nominated these men

02:01:59.520 --> 02:02:03.840
for the title
''Hero of the Soviet Union''.

02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:08.200
But the committee ruled

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.080
that because it was not wartime...

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:21.080
because it was merely an accident...

02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:25.000
they were not worthy
of the title ''Hero''.

02:02:32.800 --> 02:02:36.160
What good are honors
from such people?

02:02:39.800 --> 02:02:42.400
These men sacrificed

02:02:42.480 --> 02:02:44.360
not for a medal...

02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:48.280
but because when the time came...

02:02:50.760 --> 02:02:53.440
it was their duty.

02:02:54.560 --> 02:02:58.960
Not to the navy or to the state

02:03:02.920 --> 02:03:04.320
but to us.

02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:08.800
Their comrades.

02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:16.200
And so...

02:03:18.360 --> 02:03:21.960
- To comrades.
- To comrades!
