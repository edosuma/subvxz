00:00.925 --> 00:03.286
<i>Previously on Kyle XY...</i>

00:03.444 --> 00:04.846
How are you not burned?

00:04.932 --> 00:06.971
I... I don't know.

00:07.058 --> 00:09.314
I don't want anyone to have
a reason to take me away.

00:09.562 --> 00:11.505
No one else needs to know
that you're different.

00:11.585 --> 00:14.884
I feel hurt and angry,
and if you want to break up,

00:14.995 --> 00:17.447
- you're going to have to say it.
- I wanna break up.

00:17.533 --> 00:20.305
Doesn't matter anyway.
I've already erased you. Never happened.

00:20.404 --> 00:21.649
What if I just wanna be normal?

00:21.729 --> 00:23.768
I'm not gonna let you ruin
what we're trying to do!

00:23.854 --> 00:25.026
I don't wanna do it anymore.

00:25.112 --> 00:27.078
Now that's a well-balanced meal.

00:28.315 --> 00:30.245
What the... This is a guys bathroom.

00:30.331 --> 00:31.856
Relax. I have brothers.

00:31.954 --> 00:33.417
At least I'm in the right bathroom,

00:33.503 --> 00:35.445
Miss... whatever your name is.

00:35.531 --> 00:36.823
Andy Jensen.

00:37.645 --> 00:39.772
Tonight's mine and Charlie's
two-year anniversary.

00:39.882 --> 00:42.255
We've been through so much,
he's been so patient.

00:42.353 --> 00:43.484
I feel like I'm ready.

00:43.582 --> 00:44.719
You're not gonna like this,

00:44.799 --> 00:47.197
but I think there's something
you should know about Amanda.

00:47.279 --> 00:48.642
What's going on?

00:49.036 --> 00:50.302
It's a really stupid joke.

00:50.388 --> 00:51.605
I slept with him.

00:51.691 --> 00:53.288
This is what you wanted to tell me?

00:53.387 --> 00:56.248
You didn't think I wanted
to hear it from you? You were wrong.

00:56.328 --> 00:57.689
Get her into that family's life.

00:57.787 --> 01:00.589
Destabilizing
the boy's support structure will

01:00.675 --> 01:03.367
make him more vulnerable,
receptive to her.

01:06.163 --> 01:07.404
I'm ready.

01:17.603 --> 01:19.909
Life is made up of routines.

01:20.947 --> 01:22.541
For as long as I lived with the Tragers,

01:22.621 --> 01:24.506
my routine had been simple...

01:26.060 --> 01:27.297
until now.

01:30.600 --> 01:33.606
I wanted to explore
and develop my potential,

01:33.906 --> 01:36.503
which meant strengthening
my mind and body

01:36.598 --> 01:39.591
so I could use my abilities
without harming myself.

01:46.071 --> 01:48.252
But I had to do it in secret.

01:54.814 --> 01:57.279
The early morning and after-school
hours were the only times

01:57.359 --> 02:00.676
- I could meet with Tom Foss.
- Faster, faster. Pick it up.

02:00.756 --> 02:02.838
I was the athlete in training.

02:02.920 --> 02:04.973
I didn't come here to watch you walk it.

02:05.653 --> 02:07.330
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up.

02:07.629 --> 02:09.281
- Better.
- And he was my coach.

02:09.386 --> 02:10.338
Faster!

02:11.068 --> 02:12.935
<i>While I was finishing
my morning routine,</i>

02:13.526 --> 02:15.742
<i>the family was just starting theirs.</i>

02:19.684 --> 02:22.204
I had to get home
before they knew I was gone.

02:27.767 --> 02:29.316
Lori! Let's go!

02:35.782 --> 02:36.764
Kyle?

02:37.796 --> 02:38.734
Breakfast!

02:39.347 --> 02:41.692
<i>But life is far from a perfect science.</i>

02:41.973 --> 02:45.572
Statistically speaking,
we're all bound to slip up.

02:54.939 --> 02:56.350
Good morning.

02:56.636 --> 02:57.711
Good morning.

02:57.841 --> 02:59.284
Breakfast ready?

03:00.459 --> 03:01.571
You okay?

03:02.180 --> 03:04.701
- Just hungry.
- Then come eat.

03:06.739 --> 03:08.372
Be there in a minute.

03:12.177 --> 03:14.750
<i>This was my life, my routine,</i>

03:15.396 --> 03:18.785
<i>and making it work was going to be
a lot harder than I thought.</i>

03:36.890 --> 03:38.772
Is Josh still asleep?

03:39.238 --> 03:40.612
You're kidding, right?

03:40.799 --> 03:44.248
Stephen took him to take his driver's
test this morning. The first appointment.

03:44.425 --> 03:46.012
That's right. I forgot.

03:46.094 --> 03:48.500
How? He hasn't shut up
about it all week.

03:49.427 --> 03:50.739
Hey, how'd it go?

03:51.105 --> 03:52.912
You totally bombed, didn't you?

03:53.784 --> 03:56.300
If by "bombed" you mean a direct hit,

03:56.380 --> 03:57.484
as in I nailed it...

03:57.570 --> 03:59.000
Did you pass?

03:59.086 --> 04:01.050
Yes, I passed.

04:01.778 --> 04:04.801
In fact, the instructor said I was
the best she'd ever tested.

04:04.924 --> 04:07.456
- He was very impressive.
- Aw, way to go, Josh.

04:07.542 --> 04:09.507
- Thanks.
- Let me see that.

04:10.713 --> 04:12.241
God, that's frightening.

04:13.417 --> 04:14.644
I'll get it.

04:15.028 --> 04:17.461
You do realize
what this means, don't you?

04:17.892 --> 04:18.887
You can drive.

04:19.069 --> 04:21.416
Yes, my obvious friend, that is true.

04:21.834 --> 04:23.051
But more importantly,

04:23.149 --> 04:24.916
Dad gets to make good on his promise

04:25.014 --> 04:26.305
of buying me a new car.

04:26.588 --> 04:28.258
Oh, great. You remembered that.

04:29.595 --> 04:31.157
Dad, it's for you.

04:33.072 --> 04:34.289
A car.

04:34.559 --> 04:36.391
That's a pretty big birthday present.

04:36.502 --> 04:37.926
It sure is.

04:38.725 --> 04:40.300
That's us. Soon,

04:40.730 --> 04:42.915
we'll be the ones picking people up.

04:43.706 --> 04:45.977
And after work,
I wanna go scope out some dealerships.

04:46.057 --> 04:47.933
- Are you in?
- Absolutely.

04:51.991 --> 04:53.247
For Dad.

04:53.328 --> 04:54.772
Some light reading.

04:55.874 --> 04:56.919
Okay.

04:57.508 --> 04:59.532
Have a good day, guys.

05:07.424 --> 05:08.984
Stephen, what is it?

05:09.427 --> 05:11.041
That was the office.

05:12.113 --> 05:14.130
The company was sold this morning.

05:14.892 --> 05:16.588
Sold? I didn't know it was for sale.

05:16.793 --> 05:18.051
Neither did I.

05:18.673 --> 05:20.804
Some big conglomerate snatched us up.

05:21.086 --> 05:22.647
Well, what does this mean?

05:24.681 --> 05:25.681
It means...

05:26.277 --> 05:27.925
I just lost my job.

05:31.700 --> 05:32.746
Hi, Amanda.

05:34.219 --> 05:35.726
I don't want to talk to you.

05:35.864 --> 05:37.126
It's ok, I'll talk to you.

05:37.206 --> 05:39.478
I mean I don't want you
to talk to me, either.

05:40.706 --> 05:42.549
- I just wanted...
- You're still talking.

05:53.478 --> 05:54.796
A little service here.

05:55.886 --> 05:57.030
Hang on a sec.

05:57.239 --> 05:58.962
You must just rake in the tips.

05:59.145 --> 06:01.123
The extra 20 cents isn't worth it.

06:03.669 --> 06:05.945
Fantasizing about your dream car?

06:07.283 --> 06:08.970
Just narrowing down my choices.

06:09.705 --> 06:11.186
You're actually getting a car?

06:12.174 --> 06:13.614
It was my birthday this week,

06:13.822 --> 06:16.956
and it's all systems go from my parents
and the state of Washington.

06:17.116 --> 06:19.740
It's incredible who they let
behind the wheel these days.

06:19.856 --> 06:20.891
Don't worry.

06:21.404 --> 06:22.442
I brake for minors.

06:26.420 --> 06:28.051
Did you clear things up with Amanda?

06:30.499 --> 06:31.721
Didn't get a chance.

06:32.072 --> 06:33.457
I saw you talking to her.

06:34.543 --> 06:35.672
No talking allowed.

06:37.037 --> 06:39.484
She'll get over it,
just give her a little real estate.

06:40.875 --> 06:42.601
You know, give her some space.

06:50.986 --> 06:52.600
Is space what you wanted from Declan?

06:52.695 --> 06:55.080
What I want from Declan
is an explanation.

06:56.533 --> 06:57.619
Or a distraction.

06:57.721 --> 07:00.078
I need to do something
to get him off my mind.

07:01.071 --> 07:02.330
How about something from here?

07:04.189 --> 07:06.765
I'm not really
the "activity board" type.

07:07.201 --> 07:09.867
I mean, have you seen the people
who post these flyers?

07:10.062 --> 07:11.331
Totally hideous.

07:17.011 --> 07:20.927
The guitar, on the other hand,
is a very sexy instrument.

07:30.668 --> 07:32.111
What's the latest?

07:32.660 --> 07:34.273
Everybody's still in shock.

07:34.787 --> 07:36.399
Not even a hint this might happen?

07:37.297 --> 07:38.681
I thought things were going great.

07:38.778 --> 07:41.249
I mean, I was expecting
a big bonus at the end of the year,

07:41.337 --> 07:42.756
but now I'm looking for a job.

07:43.315 --> 07:44.882
You'll find something.

07:44.999 --> 07:48.073
Well, hon, at my level,
jobs aren't easy to come by.

07:48.268 --> 07:50.465
Everything else is a big cut in pay.

07:56.943 --> 07:58.926
I got a lot of good contacts out there.

08:00.766 --> 08:02.426
I'll put the word out right away.

08:04.145 --> 08:05.640
We should tell the kids.

08:06.722 --> 08:08.649
No. There's no point in worrying them.

08:09.862 --> 08:11.463
Let me line something up first.

08:42.025 --> 08:43.279
What are you doing?

08:43.815 --> 08:46.132
- Giving you space?
- No, you're staring at me.

08:47.151 --> 08:48.773
I just want to say one thing.

08:50.042 --> 08:52.023
You may want to say it,

08:52.780 --> 08:54.232
but I'm not ready to hear it.

09:17.223 --> 09:18.522
When are you looking for this...

09:18.652 --> 09:21.648
offensive and irresponsible
gas-guzzling heap?

09:21.771 --> 09:23.372
Right after my shift, with Kyle.

09:24.710 --> 09:26.318
Looks like you're flying solo.

09:27.660 --> 09:29.011
There goes your wingman.

09:32.826 --> 09:33.931
What are we doing?

09:34.212 --> 09:35.361
Finding equipment.

09:36.056 --> 09:38.469
- For what?
- Your next challenge.

09:40.331 --> 09:41.456
Balance,

09:41.955 --> 09:43.074
coordination,

09:43.184 --> 09:44.459
and weights.

09:45.951 --> 09:49.180
You had me run 7,642 steps this week.

09:49.440 --> 09:50.870
Now I'm gonna be lifting cement?

09:52.270 --> 09:55.025
Baylin's body gave out because
it couldn't keep up with his mind.

09:55.565 --> 09:57.368
Baylin's body failed internally.

09:57.865 --> 10:00.031
Weight training won't stop that
from happening to me.

10:00.119 --> 10:01.884
Mental and physical strength
are connected.

10:04.321 --> 10:07.245
Look, I don't mind doing the work,
but do you even have a plan?

10:07.474 --> 10:09.318
We should look at Baylin's journals.

10:09.404 --> 10:11.454
- He may knew a better way.
- I saw his journals.

10:11.540 --> 10:14.529
It's formulas, equations
you can learn that yourself.

10:14.947 --> 10:17.447
But this kind of conditioning,

10:17.857 --> 10:19.442
I can teach you.

10:20.290 --> 10:22.515
- What else do we need?
- Grab that.

10:24.971 --> 10:26.079
That's right.

10:26.554 --> 10:27.693
Inside.

10:35.972 --> 10:37.935
Looking for something?

10:38.565 --> 10:40.594
The guitar Dad got me.
Have you seen it?

10:40.827 --> 10:42.916
Well, I thing we sold it
at the garage sale, which,

10:43.002 --> 10:45.103
if I remember correctly, you told me to.

10:45.357 --> 10:46.727
Oh, yeah. Crap.

10:47.240 --> 10:49.867
Well, if you wanna play,
I'm sure you can borrow your dad's.

10:50.026 --> 10:51.070
I guess.

10:52.691 --> 10:54.688
Did you ever feel like
you're not interesting?

10:54.774 --> 10:56.581
Like you hope people
look at you and say,

10:56.680 --> 10:58.967
"Hey, that Lori Trager,
she's really good at...

10:59.102 --> 11:00.311
whatever."

11:02.724 --> 11:05.533
Everything I ever tried to be good at
is in this closet.

11:06.394 --> 11:09.496
And most of it is
in the original wrapping.

11:10.224 --> 11:13.231
Why do I get the feeling
this sudden interest in guitar

11:13.389 --> 11:14.970
has something to do with Declan.

11:15.524 --> 11:17.889
Because you're a super psychologist?

11:18.484 --> 11:20.890
- Have you tried talking to him?
- Yes!

11:21.253 --> 11:25.399
Did you try "warm and fuzzy" or
go straight for "agro-crazy teen girl?"

11:27.203 --> 11:29.260
I'll take "agro-crazy" for a thousand.

11:31.360 --> 11:33.186
I just want to know
what happened with us.

11:33.312 --> 11:35.368
Then really talk to him.

11:35.637 --> 11:39.151
You might not like what you hear, but
you can get some closure and move on.

11:40.575 --> 11:43.044
How would girls survive
without a mom like you?

11:43.266 --> 11:44.563
They get by.

11:44.989 --> 11:46.857
Have you seen Kyle?
I'm supposed to bring him

11:46.943 --> 11:48.357
to buy Josh a present.

11:48.454 --> 11:51.320
I saw him rush out after school,
but I don't know where he was going.

11:53.789 --> 11:54.827
I love you.

11:54.938 --> 11:55.969
I love you.

12:09.788 --> 12:11.215
Two thousand...

12:11.531 --> 12:12.955
four hundred...

12:13.145 --> 12:14.158
and one.

12:15.710 --> 12:16.849
Square it.

12:24.567 --> 12:26.656
5 million, 10 hundred...

12:29.529 --> 12:30.986
You lost focus!

12:38.426 --> 12:40.845
- I was trying.
- Well, try harder.

12:41.004 --> 12:43.821
An ordinary mind can convince
the body to withstand the most

12:44.011 --> 12:46.892
extreme conditions.
You should be able to handle more.

12:47.082 --> 12:49.391
Like carrying 200 pounds
while doing a math drill?

12:49.549 --> 12:52.208
- I know what I'm doing.
- Except you're not the one doing it.

12:52.999 --> 12:54.376
I've done a lot worse.

12:59.119 --> 13:00.733
What do you mean?

13:03.424 --> 13:06.210
I was in a recon extraction
unit in the service.

13:06.937 --> 13:08.014
What's that?

13:08.282 --> 13:10.276
That is "military speak"

13:10.751 --> 13:12.428
for rescue and torture.

13:13.893 --> 13:15.373
Which one were you trained for?

13:17.913 --> 13:18.982
We're done.

13:46.288 --> 13:47.681
After I leave,

13:48.393 --> 13:50.071
do you just stay here?

13:52.444 --> 13:53.869
It must get lonely.

13:56.274 --> 13:58.585
In your old apartment, I saw a picture.

13:59.535 --> 14:01.496
A woman and a little girl.

14:03.411 --> 14:04.836
Are they your family?

14:07.511 --> 14:08.619
They were.

14:13.113 --> 14:14.443
You're not together anymore.

14:16.357 --> 14:18.479
They were killed by a drunk driver.

14:27.249 --> 14:28.642
Look, you should go.

14:29.576 --> 14:31.094
They'll be looking for you.

14:36.461 --> 14:38.200
You know, if you ever need anything...

14:40.535 --> 14:42.982
You're here all alone,
and this neighborhood seems kind of...

14:43.140 --> 14:44.690
Don't worry about it.

14:48.053 --> 14:51.471
I'm just saying if you're ever
in trouble, you can call me.

14:54.762 --> 14:56.535
Okay, don't call me.

14:56.930 --> 14:58.070
Text message.

14:58.545 --> 14:59.811
Three stars.

15:01.314 --> 15:02.391
All right?

15:06.078 --> 15:07.288
Go home.

15:49.070 --> 15:50.244
You're late.

15:50.465 --> 15:52.397
- I'm sorry.
- Again?

15:52.840 --> 15:54.169
I lost track of time.

15:54.359 --> 15:56.095
Kyle, you know we have
rules about curfew.

15:56.175 --> 15:57.364
If you're gonna break them,

15:57.450 --> 15:58.937
I expect a phone call.

16:00.151 --> 16:01.228
You're right.

16:01.718 --> 16:03.367
I didn't mean to worry you.

16:04.598 --> 16:06.908
I was putting away some laundry.

16:07.288 --> 16:08.591
I found this in your room.

16:09.365 --> 16:10.767
From the fire.

16:11.070 --> 16:13.095
I don't think you should
leave it lying around.

16:18.356 --> 16:19.664
I'll get rid of it.

16:24.871 --> 16:25.891
Well...

16:26.100 --> 16:27.132
good night.

16:28.532 --> 16:29.545
Night.

17:02.009 --> 17:03.022
Hello?

17:06.189 --> 17:07.358
Who is this?

17:23.901 --> 17:25.579
Notice the way she struts?

17:25.800 --> 17:27.415
You'd need something

17:27.731 --> 17:30.168
sleek and sexy to get her.

17:31.434 --> 17:32.795
A luxury import,

17:33.143 --> 17:34.220
definitely.

17:38.211 --> 17:39.414
Pickup truck.

17:41.265 --> 17:42.224
And her?

17:43.307 --> 17:44.542
Miss Perky?

17:45.238 --> 17:46.472
Convertible.

17:49.329 --> 17:50.387
Goth girl.

17:51.159 --> 17:52.267
Batmobile.

17:52.869 --> 17:54.547
Please, challenge me.

17:55.054 --> 17:56.066
Okay.

17:56.683 --> 17:58.488
- What about you?
- Me?

17:59.311 --> 18:01.620
- A hearse.
- You are sick.

18:09.205 --> 18:10.882
I'm so sorry.

18:11.324 --> 18:12.749
It's been one of those days.

18:12.876 --> 18:14.871
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, fine.

18:15.443 --> 18:17.848
- Your jacket isn't.
- Don't worry about it.

18:17.928 --> 18:19.923
I was just so focused on my phone.

18:20.009 --> 18:21.582
Please let me pay to have that cleaned.

18:21.681 --> 18:23.324
Oh, no, really, it's not...

18:25.507 --> 18:27.565
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

18:28.167 --> 18:29.528
I... I don't think so.

18:29.718 --> 18:32.914
Have you ever lectured
at U.W. in child development, like,

18:33.072 --> 18:34.639
two or three years ago?

18:34.828 --> 18:36.569
Actually, I speak there fairly often.

18:36.728 --> 18:39.925
I knew I recognized you.
I was finishing grad school.

18:40.273 --> 18:42.394
It's Trager, right? Nicole?

18:42.804 --> 18:46.130
- I can't believe you remember.
- Oh, you were so great.

18:46.400 --> 18:49.294
Okay, now I'm definitely
paying for the cleaning.

18:49.974 --> 18:52.000
- I'm Emily. Hi.
- Hi.

18:52.776 --> 18:55.624
You know, I have to run, but please
let me know when you get the bill.

18:55.766 --> 18:57.951
I insist on reimbursing you.

18:58.457 --> 19:00.387
- You're very kind.
- Well, call me.

19:00.514 --> 19:01.798
I will.

19:12.691 --> 19:13.757
Where's Josh?

19:13.914 --> 19:15.599
- Upstairs.
- We're clear.

19:15.757 --> 19:16.875
Put it in the fridge.

19:18.659 --> 19:21.044
Please tell me you're not
taking him car shopping.

19:23.995 --> 19:26.405
A car is a big responsibility.

19:26.724 --> 19:27.852
Josh is ready.

19:28.187 --> 19:31.358
But gas is really expensive these days.

19:31.444 --> 19:33.570
I'm not sure he can afford the gas.

19:33.764 --> 19:34.997
He'll be fine.

19:35.111 --> 19:36.873
But with your recent car trouble...

19:39.282 --> 19:41.337
you're gonna...
need a new engine.

19:41.753 --> 19:43.336
So I'll get a new engine.

19:43.625 --> 19:45.198
There are plenty of mechanics out there.

19:45.284 --> 19:47.150
What if repairs
take longer than expected?

19:47.230 --> 19:48.649
Then you'd have to borrow my car,

19:48.729 --> 19:51.206
and my car doesn't get nearly
the mileage your car gets.

19:51.286 --> 19:52.621
Nicole, I made a promise.

19:53.088 --> 19:55.452
It's just... bad timing.

19:56.948 --> 19:58.753
You know, we'll talk about this later.

20:04.748 --> 20:06.543
Sorry you lost your job.

20:08.828 --> 20:10.362
Cars are expensive, and...

20:10.562 --> 20:13.274
you can't afford one for Josh
since you're out of work, and...

20:13.470 --> 20:15.416
Nicole doesn't make as much as you.

20:16.043 --> 20:17.100
I mean...

20:17.432 --> 20:19.521
get as good gas mileage as your car.

20:22.314 --> 20:24.714
Well, to tell you the truth,
I'm glad you know.

20:24.932 --> 20:26.843
Walking around here
the last couple of days,

20:27.119 --> 20:28.689
keeping a secret just...

20:29.561 --> 20:30.536
it feels awful.

20:31.406 --> 20:32.513
Must have been tough.

20:32.766 --> 20:35.286
Yeah, but don't worry.
Everything's gonna work out.

20:35.864 --> 20:37.640
What are you gonna tell Josh
about the car?

20:39.447 --> 20:40.467
I'm not sure.

20:41.614 --> 20:43.439
My dad was notorious
for breaking promises.

20:43.524 --> 20:45.121
I don't want to be that kind of father.

20:45.908 --> 20:47.038
You're not.

20:48.743 --> 20:49.878
You're a great father.

21:04.089 --> 21:05.466
What's up with that?

21:05.798 --> 21:07.014
I'm taking lessons.

21:08.919 --> 21:10.256
Well, see ya.

21:10.336 --> 21:12.424
Is it so impossible
to have a conversation?

21:13.785 --> 21:15.053
We're having one right now.

21:15.334 --> 21:16.318
Don't do that.

21:18.936 --> 21:20.228
You can't just blow me off.

21:20.345 --> 21:23.101
You can't just end what we had
and move on like it didn't matter.

21:23.199 --> 21:24.402
You erased me!

21:25.375 --> 21:27.305
I'm sorry about that. I didn't mean it.

21:30.156 --> 21:31.911
Look, we can't really talk here.

21:33.092 --> 21:35.609
Why don't you come over later?
I'll be home around 4.

21:37.517 --> 21:40.603
And if you don't show up then
I'll know there's nothing left to say.

21:52.644 --> 21:54.515
Police are still searching for any clues

21:54.607 --> 21:56.712
that may shed light
on the murder of a hunter

21:56.801 --> 21:59.838
found in the woods near Victor Falls
almost a month ago.

22:00.055 --> 22:01.696
The victim's throat was crushed.

22:01.864 --> 22:04.213
So far police have
no motive for the killing,

22:04.327 --> 22:06.077
and no suspects have been named.

22:13.124 --> 22:14.124
It's Saturday.

22:14.255 --> 22:15.736
I know.
I want you to come in.

22:16.401 --> 22:17.967
I thought I had weekends to myself.

22:18.065 --> 22:20.848
If you slack off for one day,
you'll stop making progress.

22:21.419 --> 22:22.462
This isn't a game.

22:23.702 --> 22:25.017
It's about your survival.

22:25.599 --> 22:26.654
I'll be there.

22:30.949 --> 22:33.416
Josh, stop hitting the horn.
The neighbors are gonna freak.

22:33.536 --> 22:35.514
You are the neighbor. Relax.

22:36.015 --> 22:37.733
I just wanna hear her purr.

22:39.287 --> 22:41.146
Naughty. Let me guess.

22:41.799 --> 22:45.048
.357 magnum, about 5,000 horsepower?

22:45.143 --> 22:47.147
Do you have any idea
what you're talking about?

22:47.236 --> 22:48.236
Of course.

22:54.220 --> 22:56.008
Just the guy I was looking for.

22:56.445 --> 22:57.704
You ready for tonight?

22:58.346 --> 22:59.345
Tonight?

22:59.653 --> 23:01.553
Dude, my birthday dinner at La Scala.

23:01.748 --> 23:05.060
Killer calamari,
awesome shrimp, garlic everything.

23:05.888 --> 23:06.840
It sounds good.

23:07.627 --> 23:09.965
Kyle, I'm not sensing
your excitement here.

23:10.263 --> 23:12.751
This isn't just dinner.
I get my new ride.

23:13.097 --> 23:15.847
That's a huge lift
to both our social lives.

23:17.248 --> 23:19.530
Dinner's at 6.
Bring your "A" game.

23:23.857 --> 23:25.727
He's really excited about his birthday.

23:28.230 --> 23:29.413
- About Charlie...
- Kyle.

23:29.498 --> 23:31.262
I should have told you
what was going on.

23:33.237 --> 23:36.756
Yeah, well, being someone's friend
isn't about what you should have done.

23:38.883 --> 23:40.665
It's about what you do.

23:41.415 --> 23:42.663
I know you're hurt,

23:43.427 --> 23:45.436
but you always look
for the best in people.

23:46.930 --> 23:48.416
Don't ever lose that.

24:25.759 --> 24:27.729
Where the hell is he going?

25:27.786 --> 25:30.525
I don't have time for this.
Josh's birthday dinner is tonight.

25:30.844 --> 25:32.287
Then start climbing.

25:34.474 --> 25:35.868
From weight training to this?

25:38.020 --> 25:39.125
What happened?

25:40.483 --> 25:42.616
Your anxious about something.
Is it Zzyzx?

25:43.710 --> 25:44.952
Zzyzx is gone.

25:45.716 --> 25:48.116
Stop the analyzing, and climb.

25:54.403 --> 25:56.441
Hey, buddy.
You got a second?

25:56.887 --> 25:59.393
Sure. Just getting ready
for the big night.

26:01.585 --> 26:03.221
Josh, what happened to your room?

26:03.368 --> 26:04.388
What do you mean?

26:04.706 --> 26:05.958
It's clean.

26:07.318 --> 26:09.590
I just got tired of living
in a mess all the time.

26:10.333 --> 26:11.333
I'm impressed.

26:13.306 --> 26:14.389
Is Kyle back?

26:14.899 --> 26:16.108
Uh, I don't think so.

26:16.342 --> 26:18.285
Listen, I gotta talk
to you about something.

26:18.576 --> 26:20.211
It's like he doesn't care anymore.

26:20.529 --> 26:22.588
The guy's been AWOL all week long.

26:22.901 --> 26:25.864
- Has he?
- Yeah. Where have you been?

26:27.633 --> 26:28.823
I don't know.

26:28.950 --> 26:31.204
I guess I've been
a little AWOL myself this week.

26:31.625 --> 26:34.109
I just wish things would go
back to the way they were.

26:35.552 --> 26:37.273
Yeah, tell me about it.

26:38.888 --> 26:40.926
Listen, Josh, things change.

26:41.691 --> 26:43.389
That can be hard to accept.

26:43.857 --> 26:47.084
But what you need to believe is that
things will work themselves out...

26:47.275 --> 26:48.287
in the end.

26:52.025 --> 26:53.304
About the car...

26:58.454 --> 27:00.821
- What time is it?
- You're fine. Keep going.

27:03.687 --> 27:05.916
You're almost there.
That's right. Keep going.

27:09.548 --> 27:12.036
The way you've built
this wall is impossible.

27:12.500 --> 27:13.857
Not for you.

27:15.748 --> 27:18.233
- If I fall...
- If you fall, I've got you.

27:18.988 --> 27:19.943
Trust me.

27:37.489 --> 27:38.508
Again.

27:39.272 --> 27:40.273
Do it!

28:00.506 --> 28:02.178
Hey. I'm glad you called.

28:02.277 --> 28:04.020
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

28:05.416 --> 28:07.047
- Great house.
- Thanks.

28:07.217 --> 28:08.623
So, what do I owe you?

28:09.816 --> 28:12.538
$26.

28:12.691 --> 28:14.068
Expensive cup of coffee.

28:14.256 --> 28:15.912
Make yourself at home.
I'll get my purse.

28:15.992 --> 28:17.329
Thank you.

28:37.639 --> 28:40.492
- Okay. Here you go.
- Oh, thank you.

28:40.615 --> 28:42.748
This was really so nice of you.

28:43.174 --> 28:44.715
And I have to confess,

28:44.848 --> 28:47.471
I actually had another
reason for stopping by.

28:48.699 --> 28:50.261
My sister Jessi,

28:50.571 --> 28:51.887
she's been having some problems,

28:52.014 --> 28:54.057
more than just
the typical teenage things,

28:54.168 --> 28:56.593
and I was hoping that
you might be able to sit down with her.

28:56.679 --> 28:59.987
Oh. Well, unfortunately,
I'm not in private practice,

29:00.072 --> 29:02.386
but I'd be happy to recommend
another therapist.

29:06.846 --> 29:07.888
It's just...

29:08.797 --> 29:10.984
Our parents abandoned us
when we were young,

29:11.091 --> 29:13.426
and I was left to raise Jessi by myself.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.930
I've just been having
a really hard time lately.

29:16.016 --> 29:19.330
And unfortunately, there's a history of
mental illness in the family.

29:22.084 --> 29:24.362
I just don't know where to turn anymore.

29:25.330 --> 29:26.754
And you were just so warm.

29:26.834 --> 29:28.969
I know that you would be
so good for Jessi.

29:29.797 --> 29:32.918
It's just a shame that
you can't see patients on the side.

29:39.423 --> 29:40.480
You know, I...

29:40.626 --> 29:42.498
I think I might be able to help you.

29:44.904 --> 29:46.233
That would be great.

29:51.061 --> 29:52.305
It's Hollander.

29:52.900 --> 29:55.257
Jessi's got herself a therapist.

29:57.514 --> 29:59.568
Don't get discouraged.

30:00.400 --> 30:01.487
The jump is too far.

30:01.567 --> 30:02.858
You just gotta trust yourself,

30:02.950 --> 30:04.166
believe that you can do it.

30:04.246 --> 30:05.669
I know that you can.

30:06.800 --> 30:08.642
Why do you think I push you so hard?

30:08.802 --> 30:10.424
I don't wanna let you down.

30:10.522 --> 30:12.095
It's not about that.

30:12.537 --> 30:15.091
You just... You keep trying,
do your best.

30:15.171 --> 30:16.230
You'll get there.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.742
And that jump is too far...

30:18.822 --> 30:19.851
for now.

30:19.974 --> 30:21.928
I'll add a few holes.
You can work your way up.

30:22.887 --> 30:23.908
Okay.

30:24.449 --> 30:26.330
- I better go.
- Do you want a ride home?

30:26.416 --> 30:27.506
No, thanks.

30:27.605 --> 30:28.613
This is faster.

30:36.928 --> 30:37.958
We should go.

30:38.038 --> 30:39.320
Kyle's not back yet.

30:39.405 --> 30:40.561
Where is he?

30:40.659 --> 30:42.687
Do we ever know where he is anymore?

30:42.785 --> 30:45.060
Let's just give him a few more minutes.

32:08.706 --> 32:11.718
Sorry, Josh, we gotta go now,
otherwise we'll lose our reservation.

32:13.045 --> 32:14.558
I don't care anymore.

32:33.440 --> 32:34.719
Don't move!

32:43.957 --> 32:45.838
Wait! You can't reach this from there.

33:01.968 --> 33:03.259
Okay, let go. I got you.

33:06.198 --> 33:07.341
Trust me.

33:14.892 --> 33:16.034
I got you.

33:44.623 --> 33:46.700
Save it. I'm tired of your excuses.

33:47.622 --> 33:48.999
I promise I'll make it up to you.

33:49.109 --> 33:50.879
Your promises don't mean anything.

33:51.819 --> 33:53.921
You know, I can deal
with not getting a car,

33:54.007 --> 33:56.883
'cause I thought
I still had my best friend.

33:59.224 --> 34:00.868
I guess I was wrong.

34:19.163 --> 34:20.342
We need to talk.

34:22.542 --> 34:24.018
We know what's going on.

34:24.103 --> 34:25.321
You do?

34:25.800 --> 34:28.480
We understand you're still adjusting,
but being part of this family

34:28.565 --> 34:29.697
is about trust.

34:29.967 --> 34:32.478
Now, if you don't want
to live here with us...

34:32.737 --> 34:33.913
Why would you think that?

34:34.016 --> 34:35.159
You're hardly here.

34:35.676 --> 34:37.581
You missed Josh's birthday.

34:37.728 --> 34:39.953
And we know that you've
spoken to Mr. Taylor.

34:40.395 --> 34:41.525
Mr. Taylor?

34:41.638 --> 34:43.271
Your cell phone rang the other day.

34:43.370 --> 34:45.619
The caller ID said it was from T.

34:46.922 --> 34:48.222
Was he calling because

34:48.302 --> 34:49.835
you don't want to stay?

34:50.228 --> 34:52.121
Of course I want to stay.

34:55.659 --> 34:58.125
I know I've been
distracted lately, but...

34:59.213 --> 35:02.582
I never meant to give you the impression
that I didn't want to be here.

35:04.504 --> 35:08.000
You know how committed
we are to you being part of the family.

35:08.843 --> 35:11.019
We need to know you feel the same way.

35:19.684 --> 35:21.909
Nothing is more important to me.

35:41.081 --> 35:42.741
Rough night last night.

35:45.271 --> 35:46.870
Josh is still mad at me.

35:48.681 --> 35:50.213
He's disappointed.

35:51.484 --> 35:54.078
Feels like all I do these days
is disappoint people.

35:55.761 --> 35:57.113
I know that feeling.

35:57.568 --> 35:59.951
I just wish I could have
gotten him that car.

36:01.194 --> 36:03.308
I wish there was some way
I could make it up to him.

36:05.644 --> 36:07.941
I had this great old junker in college.

36:08.027 --> 36:09.071
Junker?

36:09.245 --> 36:10.904
Yeah, this crappy old car.

36:12.524 --> 36:13.962
I remember the day I bought it.

36:14.061 --> 36:16.617
Well they practically
gave it to me for free.

36:17.956 --> 36:20.895
Now that would have been
the perfect starter car for Josh.

36:21.928 --> 36:23.623
I think I know where we can find one.

36:26.660 --> 36:27.920
Watch your step.

36:28.879 --> 36:30.084
Okay, now.

36:34.361 --> 36:36.008
What is this?

36:36.291 --> 36:37.531
It's your new car.

36:46.373 --> 36:47.531
So what do you think?

36:47.611 --> 36:48.720
This is...

36:49.642 --> 36:51.485
the coolest thing I've ever seen!

36:52.165 --> 36:54.267
It doesn't run right now,
but we're gonna fix it up.

36:54.353 --> 36:55.521
Where'd you get it?

36:55.632 --> 36:58.151
Well, you can thank Kyle here.
He found it.

36:59.160 --> 37:01.152
I thought you were too busy.

37:01.360 --> 37:03.560
Hey, this isn't just benefiting you.

37:04.001 --> 37:06.546
It's a huge lift for both
our social lives.

37:07.911 --> 37:09.631
Thought the three of us
could work on it.

37:09.730 --> 37:11.623
Dad, you don't know how to fix up a car.

37:11.709 --> 37:14.771
Well, that's true,
but Kyle just read the manual.

37:15.865 --> 37:16.995
Here, check it out.

37:58.594 --> 38:00.069
What song is that?

38:00.745 --> 38:01.789
Song?

38:01.998 --> 38:03.289
You're too kind.

38:03.925 --> 38:05.719
It's G,

38:05.805 --> 38:08.362
D, and C.

38:08.903 --> 38:11.360
Beyond that, it's the great unknown.

38:13.238 --> 38:14.603
It sounds good so far.

38:15.254 --> 38:16.188
Thanks.

38:16.360 --> 38:17.762
Can I try?

38:18.364 --> 38:19.753
Knock yourself out.

38:32.300 --> 38:34.697
Each string had a particular sound.

38:35.197 --> 38:37.304
Like a mathematical equation,
it was just a matter

38:37.390 --> 38:39.898
of recognizing patterns
and familiar shapes.

38:40.353 --> 38:44.174
Finding the right formations would
translate into musical notes.

38:45.939 --> 38:48.115
Finally,
something you're not amazing at.

38:48.214 --> 38:49.996
I never thought I'd see that day.

39:14.242 --> 39:15.288
Get out.

39:16.591 --> 39:18.104
I'm just kidding.

39:19.329 --> 39:21.395
Seriously, though, give it back.

39:22.674 --> 39:24.614
So what's your song about?

39:25.290 --> 39:26.790
New beginnings.

39:26.889 --> 39:28.057
And Declan.

39:28.142 --> 39:29.844
Mainly Declan.

39:29.980 --> 39:31.627
I'm trying to eviscerate his name.

39:31.713 --> 39:33.004
It's very therapeutic.

39:33.089 --> 39:35.154
- So you guys are...
- Over?

39:35.400 --> 39:36.850
It appears so.

39:37.527 --> 39:38.718
I'm sorry.

39:39.997 --> 39:40.932
Don't be.

39:41.116 --> 39:42.874
Who knows what he's up to these days.

40:03.032 --> 40:04.126
Sweet car.

40:04.849 --> 40:06.197
It's not the greatest?

40:08.262 --> 40:09.431
Happy birthday.

40:09.872 --> 40:11.545
You didn't have to get me anything.

40:11.718 --> 40:12.749
I know.

40:13.253 --> 40:14.631
It was on sale.

40:15.655 --> 40:16.848
I didn't know what you'd like,

40:16.928 --> 40:19.137
but I couldn't bear myself
to buy those flaps with the

40:19.223 --> 40:20.453
naked ladies on them.

40:20.539 --> 40:22.594
I love these. They're awesome.

40:24.585 --> 40:25.906
Wanna check it out?

40:28.584 --> 40:29.629
Cool.

40:34.661 --> 40:37.893
So what kind of girl do you think
I can get with this car?

40:38.163 --> 40:40.413
The kind who appreciates potential.

40:57.990 --> 40:59.231
How long has it been?

41:05.856 --> 41:07.687
Ten years next month.

41:11.190 --> 41:12.653
You were the drunk driver.

41:18.874 --> 41:20.496
When you told me what happened to them,

41:20.594 --> 41:23.200
your heart rate doubled,
and your body temperature rose.

41:25.329 --> 41:26.680
It doesn't matter. I just...

41:26.779 --> 41:28.254
wanna say I'm sorry.

41:33.446 --> 41:34.687
I wanna...

41:35.253 --> 41:37.428
thank you for coming back to help me.

41:39.250 --> 41:40.601
You can count on me...

41:41.277 --> 41:42.555
like I count on you.

41:45.014 --> 41:46.439
But here's the thing.

41:47.361 --> 41:49.697
I can tell when you're
not being truthful.

41:50.029 --> 41:52.105
So if there's something else out there,

41:52.474 --> 41:55.276
something you know could
bring danger into my life,

41:55.817 --> 41:57.256
I need you to tell me.

41:58.570 --> 42:00.389
There's nothing
to worry about right now.

42:01.895 --> 42:03.444
Let's get back to work.

42:12.967 --> 42:16.494
We all struggle to find
the right path to take in life.

42:18.191 --> 42:20.723
It's not always easy
to know what that is

42:20.834 --> 42:22.849
or where it will lead us.

42:25.049 --> 42:26.735
In the end, it's the people in our lives

42:26.815 --> 42:30.339
that provide us the balance
to help us make it through.
