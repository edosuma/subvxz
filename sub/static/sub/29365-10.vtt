WEBVTT

00:07.674 --> 00:10.218
-[cockerel crows]
-[cow moos]

00:10.343 --> 00:11.177
[Colt] Alright.

00:12.679 --> 00:15.306
Now we got that Camino out of the shed,
we oughta...

00:15.515 --> 00:18.393
clear out that spot
with the stacks of hay over it.

00:18.727 --> 00:19.561
Or...

00:19.936 --> 00:22.439
Or we could put in... a mechanical bull.

00:24.691 --> 00:25.525
[Beau] A what?

00:25.859 --> 00:27.527
You know, you shouldna said that.

00:29.070 --> 00:32.490
If you can ride a bull
while holding a piña colada,

00:32.574 --> 00:33.658
it's not a bull.

00:36.995 --> 00:40.957
Yeah, other trigger words
include white jeans,

00:41.041 --> 00:42.459
vegan chili...

00:43.918 --> 00:48.089
any reference to the grand feature film
City Slickers.

00:50.842 --> 00:53.011
Well, I don't think he's gonna enjoy

00:53.094 --> 00:56.056
my story about spilling my vegan chili
on my white jeans

00:56.139 --> 00:58.600
'cause I was laughing so hard
at City Slickers.

01:00.435 --> 01:03.605
Billy Crystal would be dead in three days
on a real ranch.

01:05.315 --> 01:06.274
Hey uh...

01:06.775 --> 01:08.818
you know, Abby's gonna be here soon,

01:08.902 --> 01:11.404
so I... should probably tell you guys...

01:12.655 --> 01:13.907
We're gettin' a divorce.

01:14.824 --> 01:15.658
What?

01:15.909 --> 01:17.494
Shit. I'm sorry, man.

01:18.286 --> 01:19.120
Yeah.

01:19.412 --> 01:22.040
-It's just one of them things, right?
-[dog barks]

01:22.165 --> 01:25.001
On the plus side, if she decides
to take me for everything I'm worth,

01:25.085 --> 01:26.586
she'll actually owe me money.

01:28.880 --> 01:30.423
I'm sorry to hear that, Son.

01:31.132 --> 01:32.884
I had great hopes for you two.

01:33.635 --> 01:35.970
I've been through a divorce,
and it's terrible.

01:36.513 --> 01:38.556
I could tell you
what my best friend told me

01:38.640 --> 01:40.391
when I was goin' through a divorce.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.769
He said, "I'm sorry
this is happenin' to you,

01:42.852 --> 01:45.105
and I'm really sorry I fucked your wife."

01:48.733 --> 01:51.111
Between you and Abby,
and me and Lisa Neumann,

01:51.194 --> 01:53.321
this is not a good time to be a Bennett.

01:53.613 --> 01:57.242
Yeah. Last couple years are
starting to feel like The Gilmore Boys.

01:59.953 --> 02:00.912
Alright.

02:01.746 --> 02:02.580
You know what?

02:03.540 --> 02:04.415
Fuck this!

02:04.541 --> 02:07.669
We're not  gonna sit on this porch
feeling sorry for ourselves.

02:08.253 --> 02:10.463
Let's go out. The three of us.

02:10.880 --> 02:13.842
I saw a billboard for an Indian casino
in New Mexico.

02:14.926 --> 02:15.927
[cow moos]

02:16.010 --> 02:16.970
Pass.

02:17.220 --> 02:20.014
Where did I lose you?
Indian casino or New Mexico?

02:21.766 --> 02:23.893
On, "Let's go out. The three of us."

02:24.769 --> 02:26.896
Hey, hold on. No, I saw that place.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.481
They got a bowling alley, Dad.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.900
Can't tell me you don't like that,
you got your own ball.

02:31.609 --> 02:34.112
I know 'cause I ain't never been allowed
to touch it.

02:34.404 --> 02:36.489
Even now, as a 35-year-old man.

02:37.782 --> 02:39.367
I do like to go bowlin'.

02:39.659 --> 02:41.661
-[dog barking]
-Haven't been in a while.

02:42.245 --> 02:43.705
Can't go with Dale anymore.

02:44.205 --> 02:45.665
Every time you bowl a turkey,

02:45.748 --> 02:48.376
he flaps his arms and gobbles
like a fuckin' turkey.

02:50.253 --> 02:51.337
[car approaches]

02:51.504 --> 02:53.506
Nope, here comes Abby.
[clears throat]

02:54.299 --> 02:56.259
She might need a shoulder to cry on.

02:56.342 --> 02:59.262
Maybe a shoulder that can bench 245.

03:00.847 --> 03:02.348
I've seen you lift, man.

03:02.432 --> 03:05.894
You can't put a 45 pound plate
on each side and call it 245.

03:08.271 --> 03:09.105
Gentlemen.

03:09.647 --> 03:11.024
Hey, Abby. Good to see you.

03:11.107 --> 03:12.817
Good to see you, too, Mr. Bennett.

03:13.109 --> 03:15.695
Alright, Abby, Beau and I...

03:18.156 --> 03:20.241
are gonna run over to the Peterson Ranch,

03:20.950 --> 03:23.077
so... leave you to it.

03:25.788 --> 03:26.873
[cow moos]

03:28.917 --> 03:29.876
How's she doin'?

03:30.543 --> 03:33.004
Yeah, she's good.
She's sleeping like a baby.

03:33.504 --> 03:35.381
Oh, shit! That's where it comes from.

03:37.467 --> 03:39.761
"Sleeping like a baby" should mean
waking up four times,

03:39.844 --> 03:41.054
crying till you get a boob,

03:41.137 --> 03:43.306
then going to the bathroom
all over yourself.

03:44.682 --> 03:47.101
If that's sleepin' like a baby,
I definitely done that.

03:48.728 --> 03:49.562
Alright, well...

03:50.605 --> 03:51.439
I'll get going.

03:51.689 --> 03:52.941
Let you start your day.

03:57.153 --> 03:58.863
[car door opens]

03:59.530 --> 04:00.448
Hey, Ab?

04:01.032 --> 04:01.950
-Yeah?
-[Peyton gurgles]

04:03.243 --> 04:04.118
[car door closes]

04:05.536 --> 04:06.537
Do you hate me?

04:07.747 --> 04:08.581
What?

04:10.750 --> 04:12.669
I just... know everything that's...

04:13.795 --> 04:16.881
going on is all my fault.
I've been an idiot lately.

04:19.217 --> 04:20.301
I'm sorry. I just...

04:21.344 --> 04:22.804
I hate everything that's happened.

04:22.887 --> 04:23.805
[ducks quacking]

04:26.099 --> 04:27.725
I don't hate you, Colt. [scoffs]

04:28.935 --> 04:31.562
I wish I did.
It would make this a lot easier.

04:32.981 --> 04:36.067
Seems like there's gotta be
a better way to do this. I mean...

04:36.234 --> 04:37.402
some people make it work.

04:37.485 --> 04:40.154
I saw in People magazine

04:40.238 --> 04:42.490
that Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner,

04:42.573 --> 04:44.826
they go on, like,
family vacations together.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.996
Of course, they don't bring along
that hot nanny anymore.

04:51.249 --> 04:53.876
I don't know.
I mean, other than being divorced,

04:53.960 --> 04:57.297
I don't think we have a lot in common
with Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck.

04:57.797 --> 05:00.174
I dunno.
She does them Capital One commercials,

05:00.258 --> 05:01.968
and we owe Capital One
a shit ton of money.

05:02.051 --> 05:02.885
[Abby laughs]

05:05.221 --> 05:06.764
You drink more than Ben.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.226
Thank you. [chuckles]

05:13.354 --> 05:15.982
We'll make it work.
Now, we just gotta figure it out.

05:16.107 --> 05:16.983
[dog barks]

05:17.275 --> 05:19.110
From now on, we just gotta make sure

05:19.193 --> 05:21.029
Peyton always sees us
for what we are.

05:21.362 --> 05:24.032
You know, two people that...
care about each other.

05:24.907 --> 05:25.992
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

05:26.409 --> 05:30.580
Okay. Fine.
When... Gisele dumps Tom Brady

05:30.663 --> 05:33.750
and we start datin', I'll make sure
Peyton knows I still care about you.

05:36.711 --> 05:39.422
Well, don't worry.
Tom and I will make sure she knows.

Hey, that smells good.

06:53.079 --> 06:53.996
What is it?

06:54.080 --> 06:56.833
It's a Spanish soup called gazpacho.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.336
I thought you might like it

07:00.420 --> 07:03.673
because it sounds like something
John Wayne would name his horse.

07:05.591 --> 07:07.969
[impersonates John Wayne]
"Giddy up, Gazpacho."

07:11.514 --> 07:13.558
His horse's name was Dollor.

07:16.018 --> 07:19.564
Which is more than I would pay
for a bowl of Spanish soup.

07:21.023 --> 07:23.526
Go on and try it,
you said it smelled good.

07:23.776 --> 07:26.821
Yeah, so does Colt's
mango green tea shampoo,

07:26.904 --> 07:30.366
but you don't see me dipping
my saltine crackers in it.

07:33.244 --> 07:34.662
Fine. I'll try it.

07:47.425 --> 07:48.468
It's cold.

07:49.927 --> 07:52.180
Yeah. That's how they serve it in Spain.

07:53.931 --> 07:55.183
How lazy are they?

07:58.144 --> 07:59.854
If that's where we're gonna go
on our trip,

07:59.937 --> 08:01.898
I thought maybe we should
try it first, you know.

08:01.981 --> 08:04.150
Get a head start on your complaints.

08:06.235 --> 08:07.570
I'm out on Spain.

08:08.279 --> 08:09.655
They don't cook their soup.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.117
They call soccer "football,"

08:13.451 --> 08:15.077
and they salsa dance.

08:16.370 --> 08:17.997
No, that's Mexico.

08:18.247 --> 08:20.458
Fine. Take Mexico off the list, too.

08:22.960 --> 08:26.005
I only suggested Spain
because I recently did that thing,

08:26.088 --> 08:28.382
where you swab your cheek
and send it to ancestry.com.

08:28.466 --> 08:30.510
It turns out I'm 10% Spanish.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.178
I'm also 2% Swedish,

08:32.261 --> 08:35.223
but I don't wanna spend my vacation
in a big fuckin' Ikea.

08:38.309 --> 08:39.143
Hold on.

08:40.102 --> 08:43.189
You willingly sent your DNA
to someone you don't know?

08:44.106 --> 08:46.734
Why don't we just invite Putin over
for dinner?

08:50.321 --> 08:52.073
Okay, if you don't wanna go to Spain,

08:52.156 --> 08:54.283
there's plenty of other places
we could go.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.452
Um... We could go to Switzerland.

08:57.036 --> 08:58.704
You like their Swiss Army knives.

08:58.788 --> 09:00.456
You gave me one for my birthday.

09:02.208 --> 09:05.962
I don't trust any country that hasn't
gone to war in the last 200 years.

09:07.964 --> 09:10.800
Beau, it was your idea to go on a trip.
We don't have to go anywhere.

09:10.883 --> 09:13.052
I'm perfectly happy
not havin' a honeymoon.

09:13.219 --> 09:14.762
No, I want to.

09:14.845 --> 09:16.722
Really? Where do you want to go?

09:16.806 --> 09:17.640
Well...

09:18.182 --> 09:19.016
I mean...

09:19.850 --> 09:22.895
I just read in Field &amp; Stream
that in Billings, Montana,

09:22.979 --> 09:25.898
you're more likely to run
into a moose

09:26.315 --> 09:27.483
than another person.

09:29.110 --> 09:32.405
So, whoever you see there, you can hunt.

09:35.449 --> 09:36.659
So you wanna go on a trip.

09:36.742 --> 09:38.619
You just wanna go somewhere
you wanna go.

09:38.869 --> 09:40.079
Look, I tell you what.

09:40.913 --> 09:43.583
You name a place right now, and I'm in.

09:43.666 --> 09:45.251
Okay, France.

09:48.504 --> 09:49.422
[Beau tuts]

09:50.464 --> 09:52.174
What the fuck? That's not fair.

09:57.972 --> 09:58.848
Alright.

09:59.599 --> 10:00.766
Not bad.

10:02.101 --> 10:04.061
Aw! Yeah.

10:08.482 --> 10:10.192
And that's why we test it.

10:11.944 --> 10:13.571
-[Abby] Hey!
-Hey.

10:13.654 --> 10:15.448
-[Abby] What are you doin--
-What's up?

10:15.948 --> 10:19.201
Hey, you know that clip-on high chair
that you wanna buy,

10:19.285 --> 10:20.870
-I told you I'd make one?
-Yeah.

10:20.953 --> 10:23.706
Do you still have the link
to where we could buy it?

10:25.041 --> 10:26.751
Yeah, I'll send it to you.

10:27.251 --> 10:30.713
Once you take your foot
off our baby's neck.

10:34.300 --> 10:37.136
Listen, we also need to move up
to a size three diaper,

10:37.219 --> 10:39.513
'cause the size two is starting
to look like a baby thong.

10:39.639 --> 10:40.806
[Colt chuckles] Yeah.

10:41.557 --> 10:43.851
I saw her the other day,
her little bottom,

10:43.934 --> 10:46.395
and she looked like
a tiny little sumo wrestler.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.355
[Abby laughing] Yeah.

10:47.730 --> 10:49.231
I'll get some tomorrow.

10:49.649 --> 10:50.900
That's okay. I can pick 'em up

10:50.983 --> 10:53.569
'cause I gotta get a prescription
for my mom anyway.

10:53.736 --> 10:56.447
And I gotta ask the pharmacist
for my mom's "vitamins."

10:56.530 --> 10:57.698
He gives me a wink,

10:57.782 --> 11:01.577
and then hands me a bottle
of women's One A Day filled with Xanax.

11:04.455 --> 11:06.749
I mean, as if she only takes one a day.

11:09.710 --> 11:12.546
Could you also pick up
some of that diaper cream?

11:12.838 --> 11:16.133
Turns out it works real well
to touch up the grout in the shower.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.638
So, listen, the reason why I stopped by

11:20.721 --> 11:24.475
is my whole family's getting together
at my parents' cabin for Thanksgiving,

11:24.558 --> 11:29.146
including my vegan Aunt June who calls
the day "the turkey Holocaust."

11:31.065 --> 11:34.485
[chuckles] I remember Aunt June.
She's the one that last Christmas,

11:34.568 --> 11:38.155
she gave you that candle made entirely
of stuff that come from her body.

11:39.824 --> 11:41.117
Anyway... Um...

11:41.367 --> 11:44.662
Everyone really wants to meet Peyton
and I know it's a big ask, but

11:44.745 --> 11:46.664
I was hoping
I could take her up there.

11:48.082 --> 11:51.794
So... I'm not gonna see Peyton
for Thanksgiving?

11:52.920 --> 11:56.590
I mean, you know how mad
my dad gets during the holidays.

11:56.674 --> 11:58.843
If Peyton's not here,
I'll be the only one crying.

12:00.636 --> 12:02.680
I'm sure you can join us if you want.

12:02.763 --> 12:04.890
Err... Yes, pass.

12:05.599 --> 12:09.937
[scoffs] Your dad used to love to
introduce me as his future ex-son-in-law.

12:10.438 --> 12:12.106
Now that joke's just not funny.

12:14.942 --> 12:15.860
Is there any way

12:15.943 --> 12:19.530
that your family would ever consider
doing Thanksgiving on Friday?

12:19.864 --> 12:21.949
Yeah, sure. Just call the NFL

12:22.074 --> 12:24.368

23:28.156 --> 23:30.450
-What's that?
-My bowling ball.

23:31.993 --> 23:33.829
If that's your ball, then whose b...

23:33.912 --> 23:35.163
Ah, fuck!

23:36.706 --> 23:39.292
Maybe next time,
you'll share your fuckin' Combos.

23:44.464 --> 23:45.799
-[Beau] Hey!
-[Joanne] Hey.

23:47.551 --> 23:48.468
Hey, Ab.

23:51.304 --> 23:52.264
Everything okay?

23:52.889 --> 23:53.807
Peyton alright?

23:53.890 --> 23:56.643
Yeah, she's upstairs sleepin'.
That's not why I'm here.

23:58.478 --> 24:00.772
[clears throat] Nick is back in town.

24:01.982 --> 24:02.816
He's what?

24:05.861 --> 24:06.862
Where d'you see him?

24:07.696 --> 24:08.530
Pharmacy.

24:10.449 --> 24:13.785
Yeah, Mary was there trying to get
some pills, then Nick showed up.

24:13.869 --> 24:15.454
Practically dragged her outta there.

24:16.413 --> 24:17.497
Jesus Christ!

24:18.331 --> 24:20.125
Uh... Hold up. Who's Nick?

24:20.834 --> 24:23.128
Mary's ex, and he's bad fuckin' news.

24:26.173 --> 24:27.507
[sighing] Oh, shit!

24:29.050 --> 24:30.552
Mary came by the cabin and

24:30.677 --> 24:33.180
told me she didn't feel safe,
wanted to stay there.

24:33.889 --> 24:35.724
I just thought it was another scam.

24:36.349 --> 24:38.059
-Fuck!
-Don't beat yourself up.

24:38.143 --> 24:39.478
-How would you know?
-[Luke huffs]

24:39.895 --> 24:41.563
Did she say where they were stayin'?

24:41.646 --> 24:43.565
No. But I got behind them on the road.

24:44.191 --> 24:47.235
I saw them turn off
into that trailer park on 55.

24:48.361 --> 24:50.655
I'm gonna see if I can get a hold of Mary.

24:56.453 --> 24:57.370
It's good.

24:58.788 --> 24:59.789
We know where they're at.

25:01.958 --> 25:04.085
Just call the cops
and get them over there.

25:05.086 --> 25:06.421
Wait. where are you goin'?

25:08.089 --> 25:09.966
Gonna go upstairs to check on Peyton.

25:12.886 --> 25:15.680
Colt's right. If Mary's in danger,
we'll call the cops.

25:15.764 --> 25:16.681
Fuck that.

25:17.390 --> 25:19.768
I told that asshole
to never come back here.

25:19.851 --> 25:20.977
What are you gonna do?

25:21.353 --> 25:23.021
What I shoulda done last time.

25:23.313 --> 25:24.147
[Joanne] Beau!

25:25.148 --> 25:26.858
Beau, stop! We'll call the police.

25:27.400 --> 25:28.860
We tried that with Rooster.

25:29.402 --> 25:30.654
They didn't do shit.

25:36.952 --> 25:39.246
Don't worry about Beau, OK?
He'll be alright.

25:39.538 --> 25:41.331
He's not the one I'm worried about.

25:42.332 --> 25:43.833
Mary's not answering.

25:45.126 --> 25:47.087
Look, how bad of a guy is this Nick?

25:47.170 --> 25:48.421
He's a fucking creep.

25:48.672 --> 25:51.174
Colt basically blames him
for Rooster's death.

25:53.218 --> 25:54.553
Fuck it. I'm goin' over there.

25:54.636 --> 25:56.388
Beau's on his way over there already.

25:56.471 --> 25:58.890
The more people involved,
the worse this'll turn out.

25:58.974 --> 26:00.892
I'm not gonna sit here and do nothing.

26:01.685 --> 26:03.436
Shit! I shouldn't have told them.

26:03.520 --> 26:05.522
And if you hadn't
and somethin' happened to Mary?

26:05.605 --> 26:08.316
-Shall we call the cops?
-We have to see how this plays out,

26:08.400 --> 26:09.859
hope they have good judgment.

26:10.694 --> 26:11.987
Fuckin' Colt!

26:14.197 --> 26:15.240
Where are you goin'?

26:15.490 --> 26:17.284
Abby, we're not together anymore.

26:17.367 --> 26:18.952
[Abby] Just... Don't be stupid!

26:19.035 --> 26:22.330
-Just stop! Think about it for one--
-This is why I didn't say anything before.

26:22.414 --> 26:24.749
-I don't wanna have this conversation.
-You're a dad.

26:24.833 --> 26:26.960
Act like Peyton's the most important thing
in your life.

26:27.043 --> 26:28.545
After what that guy did to Rooster?

26:28.628 --> 26:31.298
-You want me to do nothing?
-No! I want you to be smart.

26:31.381 --> 26:34.509
You lied to me, you blew up the dam,
you just got out of jail!

26:34.676 --> 26:37.178
If you go there right now,
you can forget about us.

26:39.389 --> 26:40.348
Forget about us?

26:42.142 --> 26:43.351
Saying we'd get back together?

26:43.435 --> 26:46.771
That's not what I'm saying. I dunno
what I'm saying. I don't know!

26:47.063 --> 26:48.857
-That's what I thought.
-Just-- Colt!

26:49.858 --> 26:50.692
Colt!

27:13.840 --> 27:15.592
-[Nick] The fuck you doing here?
