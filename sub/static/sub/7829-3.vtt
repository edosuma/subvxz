(bell ringing)

00:14.097 --> 00:15.390
D'oh!

00:15.473 --> 00:18.059
-Ahh!
-(tires screech)

00:41.458 --> 00:43.001
(humming)

00:43.084 --> 00:44.753
(bell dings)

00:44.836 --> 00:46.046
Here's your toast, Maggie.

00:46.129 --> 00:49.049
I melba-fied it myself.

00:50.550 --> 00:52.469
Oh, Lisa, honey,
I tracked down

00:52.552 --> 00:54.304
those old newspapers
for your history project.

00:54.387 --> 00:57.348
Wow, Mom, you didn't have
to go to this much trouble.

00:57.432 --> 00:59.225
Oh, it was no trouble.

00:59.309 --> 01:00.852
The hobos at the dump
were very helpful.

01:00.935 --> 01:03.980
Except one man who seemed
to have mental problems.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.607
(muffled)
Good morning.

01:05.690 --> 01:08.193
Bart, it's class photo day.
No Dracula fangs.

01:08.276 --> 01:09.861
But they told us to wear them.

01:09.944 --> 01:11.446
No, they didn't.

01:11.529 --> 01:12.447
Huh?

01:14.282 --> 01:15.867
And don't put signs
on your sister.

01:18.661 --> 01:22.457
Now, keep the lettuce
separate until 11:30.

01:22.540 --> 01:24.125
That way

01:24.209 --> 01:25.835
the lettuce stays moist
and the bread stays dry.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.337
Huh? Huh?

01:27.420 --> 01:29.672
Mom, you fuss over us
way too much.

01:29.756 --> 01:31.132
Enjoy it now

01:31.216 --> 01:32.383
because when
you're a grown-up

01:32.467 --> 01:33.927
you'll have to take care
of yourself.

01:34.010 --> 01:35.303
(whining) Marge,

01:35.386 --> 01:37.639
there's a spider
near my car keys.

01:37.722 --> 01:40.767
You did the right thing
by telling me.

01:40.850 --> 01:43.061
Shoo. Get out
of here.

01:43.144 --> 01:45.396
(sighs)
That's better.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.107
Now that we're alone,

01:47.190 --> 01:50.443
Papa Bear has a little
honey for his Mama Bear.

01:50.527 --> 01:51.653
(giggling)

01:51.736 --> 01:53.113

01:53.196 --> 01:57.408
(reading certificate)

01:57.492 --> 01:58.618
"Mineral bath,
facial massage."

01:58.701 --> 02:01.287
How did you afford these?

02:01.371 --> 02:03.123
Oh-ho,
never you mind.

02:08.878 --> 02:11.381
What advantages does
this motor car have

02:11.464 --> 02:13.383
over say, a train?

02:13.466 --> 02:15.385
Which I could
also afford.

02:15.468 --> 02:16.803
Well, you'll notice

02:16.886 --> 02:19.472
how the heated gas pedal
warms your feet while...

02:21.141 --> 02:22.976
...gently massages
your buttocks.

02:23.059 --> 02:24.394
Well, Count Homer

02:24.477 --> 02:25.645
shall we discuss the--

02:25.728 --> 02:26.771
No, we shan't.

02:26.855 --> 02:29.691
Yoink!

02:29.774 --> 02:34.237
Homie, this is so sweet,
but I can't possibly go now.

02:34.320 --> 02:35.655
The sink is full
of dirty dishes.

02:35.738 --> 02:36.781
The trash needs
to be taken out.

02:36.865 --> 02:38.158
The living room
is a mess.

02:38.241 --> 02:39.909
Oh, we'll clean up
this afternoon.

02:39.993 --> 02:40.952
What about Maggie?

02:41.035 --> 02:42.704
I got my Dad
to look after her.

02:42.787 --> 02:44.497
Behind ya!

02:44.581 --> 02:46.666
Don't do that!

02:46.749 --> 02:48.376
Don't do that!

02:48.459 --> 02:52.255
Come on, honey, you work
yourself stupid for this family.

02:52.338 --> 02:54.799
If anyone deserves
to be wrapped up in seaweed

02:54.883 --> 02:56.843
and buried in mud,
it's you.

02:56.926 --> 02:59.846
Well, all right.

02:59.929 --> 03:01.681
But I'm taking some of the ironing
with me in the ca-- Ohh!.

03:05.768 --> 03:07.854
Tighten those braids, Missy.

03:07.937 --> 03:09.105
-Hoist your flag, Dooley.
-(zipping)

03:09.189 --> 03:12.025
Nelson, you look adorable.

03:12.108 --> 03:13.735
I feel like
punching myself.

03:13.818 --> 03:15.028
Bart, stop scratching.

03:15.111 --> 03:16.863
You're messing up
your hair.

03:16.946 --> 03:19.032
Ah!! Lice!

03:19.115 --> 03:20.575
How on earth does a boy
get head lice

03:20.658 --> 03:22.911
in this day and age?

03:22.994 --> 03:25.496
We bought a wicker basket
from Trader Pete's

03:25.580 --> 03:28.041
and he was passed out
inside.

03:28.124 --> 03:30.919
(chittering)

03:31.002 --> 03:34.631
Hey, how come I get lice and
nothing happens to Milhouse?

03:34.714 --> 03:36.758
S-So cold.

03:36.841 --> 03:39.510
So very, very cold.

03:41.137 --> 03:45.225
See you in hell,
you wingless blood-suckers.

03:45.308 --> 03:48.478
(tiny shrieks)

03:48.561 --> 03:50.146
What kind of parents
would permit

03:50.230 --> 03:52.732
such a lapse
in scalpel hygiene?

03:52.815 --> 03:54.317
You'd better
check out his sister.

03:54.400 --> 03:57.111
She could be rife
with them bugs, too.

03:57.195 --> 03:59.489
Keep away.

03:59.572 --> 04:01.407
Hey, come on.

04:01.491 --> 04:02.408
Those are
prescription shoes.

04:02.492 --> 04:04.160
I need them.

04:04.244 --> 04:07.914
ALL: You have cooties,
you have cooties.

04:07.997 --> 04:10.208
No, I don't.

04:10.291 --> 04:11.584
SKINNER (on PA): <i>Lisa Simpson,</i>
<i>report to the Principal's office</i>

04:11.668 --> 04:13.795

04:16.464 --> 04:18.174
Ow!

04:18.258 --> 04:19.509
(garbled)
My tongue.

04:19.592 --> 04:20.635
Head's up.

04:24.472 --> 04:26.933
Principal Skinner,
I need some shoes.

04:27.016 --> 04:28.643
Sweet Georgia Brown!

04:28.726 --> 04:30.270
Something is rotten
at the Simpson house.

04:30.353 --> 04:31.646
(touch tones)

04:39.612 --> 04:41.447
(sighing)

04:41.531 --> 04:45.034
This is so relaxing.

04:45.118 --> 04:48.079
Homie, this was
a wonderful idea.

04:48.162 --> 04:50.039
(chuckling)
Yeah.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.375
If that mafia guy
weren't staring at us

04:52.458 --> 04:54.377
I'd take off my towel.

04:54.460 --> 04:56.504
MAN: Oh, don't mind a-me.

04:56.587 --> 04:58.464
Look, I do it first.

05:02.343 --> 05:04.637
Whoa. Would you look
at this place?

05:04.721 --> 05:07.265
Sink full of dirty dishes.
Trash not taken out.

05:07.348 --> 05:09.183
Living room a mess.

05:09.267 --> 05:10.852
Stacks of old newspapers...

05:10.935 --> 05:12.478
from 20 years ago!

05:12.562 --> 05:13.980
MAN (on TV):
<i>Get ready, gamblers</i>

05:14.063 --> 05:16.190

05:16.274 --> 05:18.151

05:19.319 --> 05:21.321
What the--
(stammering)

05:21.404 --> 05:23.698
Hm, a disheveled
and malnourished man

05:23.781 --> 05:25.575
found sleeping
in his own filth.

05:25.658 --> 05:27.201
Seems confused
and dehydrated.

05:27.285 --> 05:28.703
Where's the baby?

05:28.786 --> 05:30.038
That's her, ain't it?

05:32.081 --> 05:33.708
Kids love that water.

05:33.791 --> 05:35.585
Oh, my Lord!

05:35.668 --> 05:38.212
Stupid babies need
the most attention.

05:38.296 --> 05:39.881
WOMAN (speaking softly):

05:51.976 --> 05:53.728
(both sighing)

05:59.025 --> 06:00.651
Children, where
are your parents?

06:00.735 --> 06:02.028
I don't know.

06:02.111 --> 06:03.654
They should
be here.

06:03.738 --> 06:05.907
Yes, they should...
be here.

06:05.990 --> 06:07.658
Tsk, tsk.

06:07.742 --> 06:09.369
Those parents better
have a good excuse.

06:09.452 --> 06:10.703
(door opens)

06:10.787 --> 06:13.539
I love getting away
from this dump.

06:13.623 --> 06:16.334
It's like I'm on
some wonderful drug.

06:16.417 --> 06:17.919
(clearing throat)

06:18.002 --> 06:19.712
What's going on here?

06:19.796 --> 06:21.255
Child Welfare, ma'am.

06:21.339 --> 06:22.965
Here's a little
bedtime reading.

06:23.049 --> 06:24.342
Hmm?

06:24.425 --> 06:27.220
"Squalid hell hole?

06:27.303 --> 06:30.390
"Toilet paper hung in
improper overhand fashion.

06:30.473 --> 06:32.934
Dogs mating

06:33.017 --> 06:34.310
(whimpers)

06:34.394 --> 06:36.646
What are you doing
with my children?

06:36.729 --> 06:38.481
We're taking them where
you can't get them.

06:38.564 --> 06:40.983
What?! No, you can't!

06:41.067 --> 06:42.610
I won't let you!

06:42.693 --> 06:43.945
Mrs. Simpson, restrain yourself

06:44.028 --> 06:45.988
or you'll be arrested.

06:51.661 --> 06:53.246
(moaning)

06:53.329 --> 06:55.248
Now just relax, kids.

06:55.331 --> 06:57.875
All we're doing
is taking you to...

06:57.959 --> 07:00.628
(sinister tone)
a Foster Home!

07:00.711 --> 07:01.838
(both gasp)

07:05.925 --> 07:07.468
-Yay!
-Heydilly-ho.

07:07.552 --> 07:09.762
Welcome to your new home,
neglect-areenos.

07:12.390 --> 07:14.559
Kids, meet
your new foster family.

07:14.642 --> 07:16.519
ROD & TODD:
We love you!

07:16.602 --> 07:18.271
Uh, please don't hug me.

07:18.354 --> 07:20.398
It sickens me.

07:20.481 --> 07:22.108
I don't judge
Homer and Marge.

07:22.191 --> 07:23.317
That's for a vengeful
God to do.

07:23.401 --> 07:25.111
Mm-hmm. All we want to do

07:25.194 --> 07:26.779
is give you kids
a good home

07:26.863 --> 07:27.822
until they
get their act together.

07:27.905 --> 07:29.115
You don't understand.

07:29.198 --> 07:31.409
Mom and Dad
take good care of us.

07:31.492 --> 07:33.536
That was a baby tooth.

07:35.079 --> 07:36.622
It was loose!

07:36.706 --> 07:38.374
Don't you worry,
little girl.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.418
We'll get you some nice
county dentures.

07:47.508 --> 07:50.178
"Parents are not
to communicate with children

07:50.261 --> 07:53.014
and must stay at least
100 feet away at all times."

07:53.097 --> 07:55.016
We leave you the kids
for three hours

07:55.099 --> 07:56.684
and the county
takes them away?!

07:56.767 --> 08:00.104
Oh, bitch, bitch, bitch.

08:00.188 --> 08:02.482
I can't believe
I put my own pleasure

08:02.565 --> 08:04.233
ahead of my home
and family.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.235
That is so like me.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.862
Oh, Marge, don't
blame yourself.

08:07.945 --> 08:09.864
I'm the terrible parent.

08:09.947 --> 08:11.991
The boy bugs
the hell out of me.

08:12.074 --> 08:14.118
I can't help Lisa
with her homework.

08:14.202 --> 08:17.705
The only thing I'm fit to
take care of is a houseplant.

08:17.788 --> 08:19.332
Lousy houseplant!

08:19.415 --> 08:21.918
Oh, son of a--
I'll teach you to--

08:22.001 --> 08:23.461
(sputtering)

08:33.012 --> 08:34.639
Go with it!

08:34.722 --> 08:37.141
Here you go, Todd,
the City Edition.

08:40.311 --> 08:42.480
Bart, I don't know if this
should be an extra.

08:42.563 --> 08:44.941
Is your source
on this reliable?

08:45.024 --> 08:46.984
Oh, I hate this place.

08:47.068 --> 08:49.070
Yeah, it seems
like our house

08:49.153 --> 08:51.781
but everything's got a creepy
Pat Boone-ish quality to it.

08:51.864 --> 08:54.408
Hey, kids, nachos,
Flanders-style!

08:54.492 --> 08:56.160
That's cucumbers
with cottage cheese.

08:57.328 --> 08:58.829
(sniffing)

08:58.913 --> 09:00.540
(spitting)

09:00.623 --> 09:03.334
Oh, Bart, I know you're
still getting adjusted here.

09:03.417 --> 09:04.919
Tell you what,

09:05.002 --> 09:07.046
we'll do whatever
you want to do.

09:07.129 --> 09:08.506
Watch Itchy and Scratchy!

09:08.589 --> 09:11.259
Well, I guess a little
television won't hurt.

09:11.342 --> 09:13.511
I used to let the boys
watch "My Three Sons"

09:13.594 --> 09:15.471
but it got them all
worked up before bedtime.

09:17.181 --> 09:18.724

09:18.808 --> 09:21.227

10:03.603 --> 10:05.563

kitty's ears?

10:05.646 --> 10:08.566
Uh... that's just
raspberry jam.

10:08.649 --> 10:10.776
Dad, should I poke Rod
with a sharp thing

10:10.860 --> 10:12.028
like the mouse did?

10:12.111 --> 10:15.531
No, son. No sirree, Bob.

10:18.784 --> 10:19.910
Can you see them?

10:19.994 --> 10:21.579
I can see Lisa...

10:21.662 --> 10:23.623
but it might be
a starfish.

10:23.706 --> 10:25.374
I got to call them.

10:35.718 --> 10:38.054
We're going downtown
to get our kids back.

10:38.137 --> 10:39.430
Right now!

10:41.307 --> 10:43.351
We've always tried
to be good parents.

10:43.434 --> 10:46.604
Please. I'm begging you
one mother to another.

10:46.687 --> 10:48.230
You must have a family.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.441
No. I don't care for children.

10:50.524 --> 10:52.401
Now, wait a minute!

10:52.485 --> 10:54.904
Okay. I'm not gonna win
Father of the Year.

10:54.987 --> 10:57.657
In fact, I'm probably
the last guy in the world

10:57.740 --> 10:58.783
who should have kids...

10:58.866 --> 11:00.660
Well... wait...

11:00.743 --> 11:02.453
Can I start again?

11:02.536 --> 11:04.622
Fathering children is
the best part of my day.

11:04.705 --> 11:06.540
I'd do anything
for Bart and Lisa.

11:06.624 --> 11:08.501
-And, uh, Margaret?
-Who?

11:08.584 --> 11:09.669
Lady, you got
the wrong file.

11:09.752 --> 11:11.253
It's Maggie.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.089
Oh, Maggie. I got
nothing against Maggie.

11:13.172 --> 11:16.300
I can see you sincerely
want your children back

11:16.384 --> 11:19.136
but you have a lot to learn
about being parents.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.138
Before I can return
your children,

11:21.222 --> 11:22.390
you'll have to complete
a course called

11:22.473 --> 11:23.641
"Family Skills."

11:23.724 --> 11:25.518
It teaches parents
to listen to--

11:25.601 --> 11:28.187
-Communication. Gotcha.
-But it's important to--

11:28.270 --> 11:29.939
-Listen, yes, I know--
-But there's more to it--

11:30.022 --> 11:31.148
I have listening skills.

11:31.232 --> 11:32.525
Mr. Simpson
would you please--

11:32.608 --> 11:33.776
Shut up, Judge!

11:33.859 --> 11:35.945
Peek-a-boo. I see you.

11:36.028 --> 11:36.946
(giggles)

11:37.029 --> 11:39.198
Peek-a-boo. I see you.

11:41.909 --> 11:43.828
I never heard Maggie
laugh like that before.

11:43.911 --> 11:45.162
Well, when was
the last time

11:45.246 --> 11:47.164
Dad gave her that
kind of attention?

11:47.248 --> 11:48.541
When she swallowed that
quarter,

11:48.624 --> 11:49.750
he spent
all day with her.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.043
I thought I could
ride this thing out

11:51.127 --> 11:52.086
but everything's just
too weird here.

11:52.169 --> 11:53.713
I know.

11:53.796 --> 11:56.340
They put honey on pancakes
instead of maple syrup.

11:56.424 --> 11:58.801
And they read Newsweek
instead of nothing.

11:58.884 --> 12:00.386
C'mon you Gloomy-Gusses.

12:00.469 --> 12:02.513
Who's up for a big bowl of
non-fat ice milk?

12:02.596 --> 12:04.098
I want wintergreen.

12:04.181 --> 12:05.099
Unflavored for me.

12:07.768 --> 12:10.855
And then I saw my boy
in a burlap sack

12:10.938 --> 12:13.232
and they told me
he had lice.

12:13.315 --> 12:15.276
This story going
somewhere?

12:15.359 --> 12:16.777
All right, easy there, Flub.

12:16.861 --> 12:18.154
We're all going
to get a chance.

12:18.237 --> 12:20.030
Mrs. Skinner,
why are you here?

12:20.114 --> 12:21.240
The county is threatening

12:21.323 --> 12:23.117
to take my Seymour away.

12:23.200 --> 12:27.413
We had another fight over
the inflatable bath pillow.

12:27.496 --> 12:30.207
I kept screeching and
screeching at him but--

12:30.291 --> 12:33.252
Alright. Very good.
Now who knows how the Skinners

12:33.335 --> 12:35.212
could have resolved
this problem?

12:35.296 --> 12:37.381
Without resorting to violence...

12:37.465 --> 12:39.341
or childish name-calling.

12:39.425 --> 12:40.843
Anybody?

12:40.926 --> 12:42.303
Okay, that's okay.

12:42.386 --> 12:43.763
Because making a happy home

12:43.846 --> 12:45.931
isn't like flipping on
a light switch.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.683
Duh, light switch?

12:47.767 --> 12:49.226
There are a lot of
little tricks to it.

12:49.310 --> 12:50.811
Things you should have
learned a long time ago.

12:50.895 --> 12:54.648
Such as: if you leave milk out,
it can go sour.

12:54.732 --> 12:56.358
Put it in the refrigerator

12:56.442 --> 12:59.153
or failing that,
a cool, wet sack.

13:00.821 --> 13:03.741
And put your garbage
in a garbage can, people.

13:03.824 --> 13:05.159
I can't stress that enough.

13:05.242 --> 13:06.744
Don't just throw it
out the window.

13:06.827 --> 13:09.205
This is so humiliating.

13:09.288 --> 13:11.207
"Garbage in garbage can."

13:11.290 --> 13:12.792
Hmm, makes sense.

13:12.875 --> 13:15.628
Nighty night, my sweet
little foundling-a-dings.

13:15.711 --> 13:17.213
But it's only 7:00.

13:17.296 --> 13:19.632
Yeah, the sun is still out.

13:19.715 --> 13:21.801
(children chattering)

13:21.884 --> 13:23.302
(both sighing)

13:27.389 --> 13:30.434
<i>♪ They say your folks</i>
<i>can't pay the rent ♪</i>

13:30.518 --> 13:34.438
<i>♪ So we're watching you</i>
<i>by act of government ♪</i>

13:34.522 --> 13:37.608
<i>♪ Well, I don't know</i>
<i>if the allegations are true ♪</i>

13:37.691 --> 13:41.821
<i>♪ But you got us,</i>
<i>and baby, we got you ♪</i>

13:41.904 --> 13:46.200
<i>BOTH:</i>
<i>♪ Babe, we got you, babe. ♪</i>

13:46.283 --> 13:49.119
You know, Maggie hasn't been
a Simpson as long as us.

13:49.203 --> 13:51.831
I think she's beginning
to forget Mom and Dad.

13:51.914 --> 13:54.667
Remember how Mom used
to microwave our underwear

13:54.750 --> 13:56.210
on cold days?

13:56.293 --> 13:58.003
Or the way Dad used
to call the radio station

13:58.087 --> 13:59.797
with fake traffic tips?

14:01.799 --> 14:03.926
(both sighing)

14:04.009 --> 14:05.261
They're ten feet away

14:05.344 --> 14:06.971
and we can't even
talk to them.

14:07.054 --> 14:09.723
I wish I could tell them
how much I miss them.

14:18.566 --> 14:21.443
It's so quiet here
without the kids.

14:21.527 --> 14:23.445
What I wouldn't give
to hear Lisa play

14:23.529 --> 14:25.739
another one
of her jazzy tunes.

14:25.823 --> 14:28.784
Saxa-ma-phone.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.703
Saxa-ma-phone.

14:30.786 --> 14:32.454
Aw...

14:32.538 --> 14:34.498
I miss the way Bart
would say something

14:34.582 --> 14:36.542
and then say "dude."

14:36.625 --> 14:38.669
I wish I knew something
about the baby

14:38.752 --> 14:39.837
I could miss now.

14:39.920 --> 14:42.131
-You mean Maggie?
-That's it.

14:42.214 --> 14:45.175
We've never been separated
from the kids for so long.

14:45.259 --> 14:46.468
I don't know how much
more I can take.

14:46.552 --> 14:48.304
(rapid doorbell ringing)

14:48.387 --> 14:49.805
BOTH: That's Bart's ring!

15:01.817 --> 15:03.485
"Todd smells."

15:03.569 --> 15:05.195
Aw, I already knew that.

15:05.279 --> 15:06.655
Look at the other side.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.537
(both sighing)

15:16.540 --> 15:18.459
Okay let's see if
we've learned anything.

15:18.542 --> 15:22.463
I want you two to simulate a
typical household problem. Go.

15:22.546 --> 15:25.925
Pa, I cut myself
on the screen door again.

15:26.008 --> 15:27.676
Why you cotton-pickin'--!

15:27.760 --> 15:28.677
(growling)

15:28.761 --> 15:30.095
(gagging)

15:35.893 --> 15:39.188
No, I got to pass
this class for my kids.

15:39.271 --> 15:42.441
Son, let's stop
the fussin' and a-feudin'.

15:42.524 --> 15:44.360
I love you, Pa.

15:44.443 --> 15:46.278
I love you, Cletus.

15:46.362 --> 15:48.238
(laughing and crying)

15:48.322 --> 15:51.158
(cheering, applause)

15:51.241 --> 15:53.285
(gunshots)

15:53.369 --> 15:55.037
Well, children,
it's Saturday night

15:55.120 --> 15:58.123
so what say we let our hair
down and play Bombardment--

15:58.207 --> 15:59.500
-Yay!
-Yay!

15:59.583 --> 16:01.210
Of Bible Questions?

16:01.293 --> 16:02.544
-Yay!
-Yay!

16:02.628 --> 16:03.796
Which version shall it be?

16:03.879 --> 16:04.922
St. James.

16:05.005 --> 16:06.298
The Vulgate
of St. Jerome.

16:07.758 --> 16:08.968
Vulgate it is.

16:09.051 --> 16:11.178
-Oh...
-Okay, for one gold star,

16:11.261 --> 16:14.682
what Persian king exempted
the Levites from taxation?

16:14.765 --> 16:16.684
-Ataxerxes.
-Righty-o!

16:20.020 --> 16:20.896
(cough)

16:25.317 --> 16:27.486
-NED: Well?
-I know!

16:27.569 --> 16:30.197
No, son, we got to let
Bart and Lisa get one.

16:30.280 --> 16:31.740
Come on,
this one's easy.

16:33.575 --> 16:34.910
We give up.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.453
Well, guess.

16:36.537 --> 16:38.288
Book of Revelations...
fire-breathing lion's head.

16:38.372 --> 16:39.415
Tail made
out of snakes.

16:39.498 --> 16:40.749
Who else is it gonna be?

16:40.833 --> 16:42.126
Jesus?

16:42.209 --> 16:45.379
Je-- Jes--

16:45.462 --> 16:47.131
Don't you kids know anything?

16:47.214 --> 16:49.049
The Serpent of Rehaboam?

16:49.133 --> 16:51.260
The Well of Zohassadar?

16:51.343 --> 16:54.221
The Bridal Feast
of Beth Chadruharazzeb?

16:54.304 --> 16:56.974
That's the kind of thing you should
start learning at baptism.

16:57.057 --> 17:00.144
Um, actually, you see...

17:00.227 --> 17:01.770
we were never baptized.

17:01.854 --> 17:02.813
(gasping)

17:02.896 --> 17:04.023
(moaning)

17:05.065 --> 17:07.776
Oh, Neddie! Neddie!

17:07.860 --> 17:09.028
Neddie!

17:11.655 --> 17:12.698
No, that ain't
gonna do it.

17:12.781 --> 17:14.658
(moaning)

17:14.742 --> 17:16.368
I'm very proud of you people.

17:16.452 --> 17:17.619
You've learned how to care
for your children,

17:17.703 --> 17:18.996
how to maintain
your homes,

17:19.079 --> 17:21.165
and you've all passed
the drug test.

17:21.248 --> 17:22.541
Except for Marge.

17:22.624 --> 17:24.626
Marge, you tested positive
for crack and P.C.P.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.462
Oh, my!

17:26.545 --> 17:28.589
Okay, the re-test
says you're clean.

17:28.672 --> 17:29.798
Sorry about the mistake.

17:29.882 --> 17:32.593
The only thing
I'm high on is love.

17:32.676 --> 17:35.637
Love for my son
and daughters.

17:35.721 --> 17:39.099
Yes, a little L.S.D.
is all I need.

17:39.183 --> 17:41.560
All right,
sounds very good.

17:41.643 --> 17:43.479
(laughter and gunshots)

17:46.106 --> 17:47.900
Jeepers H. Crackers.

17:47.983 --> 17:48.984
I'd better call the reverend.

17:51.820 --> 17:54.198
Ned Flanders
is on the phone.

17:54.281 --> 17:56.742
Hello, Ned.

17:56.825 --> 17:58.118
Reverend, emergency.

17:58.202 --> 17:59.453
I-- It's
the Simpson kids.

17:59.536 --> 18:01.330
Eedily... baptism...

18:01.413 --> 18:03.332
oodily...
doodily, doodily!

18:03.415 --> 18:05.000
Ned, have you thought

18:05.084 --> 18:06.585
about one of the other
major religions?

18:06.668 --> 18:09.546
They're all
pretty much the same.

18:09.630 --> 18:11.215
(crash)

18:11.298 --> 18:13.258
Oh... damn Flanders.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.763
Looks like I'm gonna have to
baptize you myself.

18:19.681 --> 18:23.602
(air horn blares
"Hallelujah Chorus")

18:23.685 --> 18:26.772
Kids, we're
good parents now.

18:26.855 --> 18:28.190
Get your asses out here!

18:28.273 --> 18:29.900
We missed you
so much.

18:29.983 --> 18:31.235
(gasps)

18:33.695 --> 18:36.490
He's going to baptize
our children?

18:36.573 --> 18:37.991
Oh, no!

18:38.075 --> 18:40.536
In the eyes of God,
they'll be Flanderseseses.

18:40.619 --> 18:43.455
Until this I never thought
Homer and Marge were bad parents

18:43.539 --> 18:45.040
but now I know
you kids need

18:45.124 --> 18:46.750
a less
hell-bound family.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.043
Just sit back

18:48.127 --> 18:49.294
and before you know it,

18:49.378 --> 18:51.630
you'll be part
of the Flanders flock.

18:51.713 --> 18:52.798
(laughs)

18:52.881 --> 18:54.716
You're gonna be
Lisa Flanders.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.301
You're going
to be Bart Flanders.

18:56.385 --> 18:57.344
Ah!

18:57.427 --> 18:59.138
Oh, relax, Bart.

18:59.221 --> 19:00.848
Your sister Maggie
isn't scared.

19:00.931 --> 19:02.766
That's because she can't talk.

19:04.560 --> 19:06.812
Daddily-doodily.

19:10.274 --> 19:12.025
Where are we going?
Where are we going?

19:12.109 --> 19:13.735
Okay, okay. Don't panic.

19:13.819 --> 19:17.197
To find Flanders, I just have
to think like Flanders.

19:17.281 --> 19:18.991
HOMER'S BRAIN:
<i>I'm a big four-eyed lame-o</i>

19:19.074 --> 19:21.201
<i>and I wear the same</i>
<i>stupid sweater everyday and--</i>

19:21.285 --> 19:22.536
The Springfield River!

19:23.829 --> 19:27.040
<i>♪ ...I once was lost ♪</i>

19:27.124 --> 19:29.918
<i>♪ But now am found ♪</i>

19:30.002 --> 19:36.925
<i>♪ Was blind, but now I see ♪</i>

19:37.009 --> 19:38.719
Today we write a new page

19:38.802 --> 19:40.554
in the Flanders family bible.

19:44.433 --> 19:47.269
Who wants to be the first
to enter God's good graces?

19:48.520 --> 19:50.355
Easy, easy.

19:50.439 --> 19:51.356
(approaching car)

19:53.317 --> 19:55.944
Oh, why do You hate my trains?

19:59.698 --> 20:00.949
(tires screeching)

20:04.494 --> 20:06.163
(roaring)

20:06.246 --> 20:08.123
(grunting)

20:10.542 --> 20:12.836
(yelling)

20:12.920 --> 20:14.755
Son of a--

20:15.380 --> 20:17.424
(gasps)

20:17.507 --> 20:18.842
Do you reject Satan

20:18.926 --> 20:20.844
and all
his empty promises?

20:20.928 --> 20:26.600
(in slow motion)
No!

20:28.602 --> 20:30.395
(sizzling)

20:30.479 --> 20:33.357
(pained yell)

20:43.325 --> 20:45.661
Wow, Dad, you took
a baptismal for me.

20:45.744 --> 20:47.329
How do you feel?

20:47.412 --> 20:50.249
Oh, Bartholomew, I feel
like St. Augustine of Hippo

20:50.332 --> 20:52.793
after his conversion
by Ambrose of Milan.

20:52.876 --> 20:55.128
Wait, Homer--
What did you just say?

20:55.212 --> 20:57.047
I said shut your ugly face,
Flanders!

20:57.130 --> 20:58.423
Oh. Fair enough.

20:58.507 --> 21:00.842
Oh. There's my sweet
little Maggie.

21:24.574 --> 21:27.119
Oh, Maggie, you're
a Simpson again.

21:27.202 --> 21:28.120
(belches)

21:35.877 --> 21:38.463
So, what was it like
at the Flanders' house?

21:38.547 --> 21:39.840
Yeah, give me
all the dirt.

21:39.923 --> 21:42.801
Let's see...
dirt... dirt.

21:42.884 --> 21:44.261
Well, there wasn't
really much dirt.

21:44.344 --> 21:46.263
There was a bunch
of old paint cans

21:46.346 --> 21:47.347
in the garage, though.

21:47.431 --> 21:49.349
(Homer laughs)

21:49.433 --> 21:51.268
Old painty-can Ned!

21:51.351 --> 21:53.937
(all laugh)

21:54.021 --> 21:56.273
HOMER: I always knew he'd keep
his old cans of paint!

21:56.356 --> 21:58.900
BART: Yeah!

21:58.984 --> 22:00.027
