WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.737
Okay, here's the grid
for the week.

00:03.837 --> 00:06.107
Thursday, Rory's performing
at an old-folks home.

00:06.207 --> 00:07.708
They don't ask,
but he keeps going.

00:07.808 --> 00:08.709
Can anyone pick up?

00:08.809 --> 00:09.877
Yeah, I'll get him

00:09.977 --> 00:11.745
after Graham's
allergy appointment.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.747
Did you know you could be
allergic to birds?

00:13.847 --> 00:15.249
Like, all of them?

00:15.349 --> 00:17.051
So, I really wanted to
get a smoothie tomorrow

00:17.151 --> 00:18.219
sometime after 4:00,

00:18.319 --> 00:20.221
if anyone could
hold Jack then?

00:21.855 --> 00:23.191
Yeah, I might not
understand the grid.

00:23.291 --> 00:24.192
Mm.

00:24.292 --> 00:25.526
Douglas,
you have the kids

00:25.626 --> 00:26.960
for Saturday night
sleepover.

00:27.061 --> 00:28.196
And no wriggling
out of it.

00:28.296 --> 00:29.897
We're sick of
your stupid work excuses.

00:29.997 --> 00:32.466
I'm a doctor. If I don't
pick up my phone, people die.

00:32.566 --> 00:33.601
You're a dermatologist.

00:33.701 --> 00:34.935
If you don't
pick up your phone,

00:35.035 --> 00:36.770
people go to the store
and buy a cream.

00:36.870 --> 00:37.938
Look, Saturday night
sleepover's a lot,

00:38.038 --> 00:39.273
but you can hack it.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.242
I spend every Saturday night
the same way --

00:41.342 --> 00:43.611
I have two glasses of Scotch
and I sit in my sauna

00:43.711 --> 00:45.779
until I'm lightheaded enough
to pass out.

00:45.879 --> 00:48.582
Now, if you want five kids
to watch me do that

00:48.682 --> 00:50.918
and then they could
politely put themselves to bed,

00:51.018 --> 00:52.086
be my guest.

00:52.186 --> 00:53.087
-Yeah, thank you.
-Great.

00:53.187 --> 00:54.788
What's up, Grid Squad?

00:54.888 --> 00:56.424
I see I'm on the board
for Tuesday.

00:56.524 --> 00:57.458
I will not let you down.

00:57.558 --> 00:58.726
Relax,
it's a babysitting grid,

00:58.826 --> 00:59.960
not Band of Brothers.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.263
Okay, sure,
but can I just say how much fun

01:02.363 --> 01:04.432
I've had with all of you
since I got on this thing.

01:04.532 --> 01:06.234
So many great
one-on-one hangs.

01:06.334 --> 01:08.436
I mean, Miggy,
epic game of basketball

01:08.536 --> 01:09.803
with my laundry hamper.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.805
Yeah. I broke your hamper
like Shaq. Unh!

01:11.905 --> 01:13.141
So worth it.

01:13.241 --> 01:15.109
Poppy here is teaching me
about sex crystals.

01:15.209 --> 01:17.411
I will say I have one
on my body right now.

01:17.511 --> 01:20.080
Won't say where, 'cause
it's incredibly uncomfortable.

01:20.181 --> 01:21.182
That means it's working.

01:21.282 --> 01:23.351
But, Douglas,
you and I have yet

01:23.451 --> 01:25.153
to have
our one-on-one hang time.

01:25.253 --> 01:27.655
Yeah, well, see,
the grid isn't about friendship.

01:27.755 --> 01:28.822
It's business.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.191
It's a little bit
about friendship.

01:30.291 --> 01:31.525
Dude, Douglas
doesn't want friends.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.594
I mean, look at him.
He's old as hell.

01:33.694 --> 01:34.962
-Mm-hmm.
-Why do I know you?

01:35.062 --> 01:36.297
All right,
how about this --

01:36.397 --> 01:38.466
you and I go find
a steakhouse right now,

01:38.566 --> 01:39.967
share our first prime rib.

01:40.067 --> 01:41.702
Rare. No sides.

01:41.802 --> 01:43.304
-Look at me, Lance.
-It's Will.

01:43.404 --> 01:45.173
It's 8:30 in the morning,
all right?

01:45.273 --> 01:46.474
I'm not sharing a steak
with you.

01:46.574 --> 01:47.975
Yeah, you're right.
Silly idea.

01:48.075 --> 01:50.344
But...what if it
were bagels?

01:50.444 --> 01:52.346
Nothing like a good
pumpernickel. (chuckles)

01:52.446 --> 01:53.814
Yeah, no, you're right,
it's a bad idea.

01:53.914 --> 01:54.848
Forget about it.

01:54.948 --> 02:00.454
**

02:00.554 --> 02:02.723
WILL: Okay, we are almost packed
for the sleepover.

02:02.823 --> 02:04.458
I've got
your sleeping bag, PJs,

02:04.558 --> 02:08.196
and some conversation starters,
in case there's a lull.

02:08.296 --> 02:09.530
"Pixar,"

02:09.630 --> 02:11.199
"ice-cream toppings,"

02:11.299 --> 02:14.001
"Anne Hathaway --
is it time for a comeback?"

02:14.101 --> 02:15.836
Dad, I don't need these.

02:15.936 --> 02:17.137
I'm hanging
with my friends.

02:17.238 --> 02:18.672
You're right.
Soph, I'm so proud of you.

02:18.772 --> 02:20.241
A couple weeks in,
you've already found your crew.

02:20.341 --> 02:21.809
You okay
without me tonight?

02:21.909 --> 02:24.678
Are you kidding? I got
a ton of irons in the fire.

02:24.778 --> 02:27.648
Bowling alley,
bars, horse track.

02:27.748 --> 02:29.883
You're just naming places.
Correct.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.386
I don't know, I was kind of
itching for a guys' night.

02:32.486 --> 02:33.921
I haven't had one
in such a long time.

02:34.021 --> 02:35.323
Douglas'll come around.

02:35.423 --> 02:37.391
Right?! I mean,
we're dudes with daughters.

02:37.491 --> 02:38.859
We should be friends.

02:38.959 --> 02:40.894
I just can't
find my way in there.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.830
He's like this 7-foot-tall
emotional fortress

02:42.930 --> 02:45.333
with no handholds or footholds
for me to climb.

02:45.433 --> 02:48.736
I just gotta wait
for my window to open and...

02:48.836 --> 02:51.772
Hold...
the flippin'... phone.

02:51.872 --> 02:52.940
Oh, no.
What's happening?

02:53.040 --> 02:56.444
The sleepover...
is...my window.

02:56.544 --> 02:58.111
Dad, why are you
talking like that?

02:58.212 --> 02:59.880
Think about it, Soph.
He's alone.

02:59.980 --> 03:01.682
He's confined.
He needs help with the kids.

03:01.782 --> 03:03.551
Look at us,
putting our heads together!

03:03.651 --> 03:05.786
I don't want my name on this!

03:05.886 --> 03:08.956
I can't believe I have to work
on a sleepover night.

03:09.056 --> 03:11.625
I swear running your
own business is like
having another child.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.126
Yeah, well, at least
your wine bar

03:13.227 --> 03:15.263
doesn't sit on the toilet
while you take a shower.

03:15.363 --> 03:17.798
Well, I hope one of us
is getting some tonight.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.099
You still
seeing that guy from work?

03:19.199 --> 03:20.133
Uh, Owen?

03:20.234 --> 03:21.735
Yeah. He's great.

03:21.835 --> 03:23.771
We work
really well together.

03:23.871 --> 03:26.274
**

03:26.374 --> 03:27.775
Oh, don't forget we're singing
"Happy Birthday" to Adam

03:27.875 --> 03:29.310
in like 10 minutes.
Oh, I didn't sign the card.

03:29.410 --> 03:30.978
I signed it for you.
Aww.

03:31.078 --> 03:32.446
Too bad
it can't go anywhere,

03:32.546 --> 03:34.615
because our dates
only ever last 90 minutes

03:34.715 --> 03:36.250
and then Graham calls,
all homesick,

03:36.350 --> 03:37.585
needing me to pick him up.

03:37.685 --> 03:39.287
That's just enough time
for sex on the couch

03:39.387 --> 03:41.389
and one episode of that
true-crime doc, Slick Patio.

03:41.489 --> 03:42.790
Oh, my God,
I'm only three episodes in,

03:42.890 --> 03:44.425
but I'm telling you,
that slow son did it.

03:44.525 --> 03:46.427
No kidding.
Wait, only sex on the couch?

03:46.527 --> 03:48.596
Yeah. We've never made it
to the bed.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.564
But the bed
is where it all happens.

03:50.664 --> 03:53.100
The kissing, the cuddling,
the explaining your weird scars.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.002
(door closes,
footsteps approaching)
Yeah, well,
I would be doing all that

03:55.102 --> 03:56.937
if my kid
were sleepover ready.

03:57.037 --> 03:58.439
So, this is
all about Graham?

03:58.539 --> 03:59.440
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

03:59.540 --> 04:00.608
(sighs)

04:00.708 --> 04:02.075
Oh, hey, Angie!

04:02.175 --> 04:03.777
Yo, Poppy,
I need to borrow your blender.

04:03.877 --> 04:05.679
Gonna puree this boy
some bananas.

04:05.779 --> 04:07.815
Oh, that reminds me --
I also need bananas.

04:07.915 --> 04:10.017
Oh, and I'm sorry, um,
but I'm gonna be late again

04:10.117 --> 04:11.285
with rent this month.

04:11.385 --> 04:13.186
But I'll getcha back soon.
I promise.

04:13.287 --> 04:16.524
Poppy,
has he ever paid rent?

04:16.624 --> 04:19.293
I mean,
he'll pay eventually.

04:19.393 --> 04:22.330
It's Miggy, you know.
He's a work in progress.

04:22.430 --> 04:23.664
Remember
how we found him?

04:23.764 --> 04:26.133
(Jack crying)
Pull-ups? Pre-fold?

04:26.233 --> 04:28.302
Pockets? Cloth?

04:28.402 --> 04:29.703
What are you?!

04:29.803 --> 04:31.138
Ugh.

04:31.238 --> 04:33.707
He ended up buying pull-ups
for himself that day.

04:33.807 --> 04:35.376
Yeah, and he's
taking care of the baby

04:35.476 --> 04:37.177
so Jack's mom
can go to college.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.212
So, I want to help him.
And he's doing great.

04:39.313 --> 04:40.848
Made a list
of potential careers.

04:40.948 --> 04:43.384
Hmm. Sounds promising.
Have you seen it?

04:43.484 --> 04:45.218
He's got it
all under control.

04:45.319 --> 04:46.687
Aah! Oh, damn.

04:46.787 --> 04:49.857
(Jack cries)
Oh, I know. I know.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.692
I got it, though.
I got it. Here.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.127
I'd ask to see that list.
Yeah.

04:54.227 --> 04:56.063
(shredder whirring)

04:56.163 --> 04:59.533
Um, this is what
we're doing tonight?

04:59.633 --> 05:02.470
Dad says the trick is
making the pieces small enough

05:02.570 --> 05:04.338
that he can't
get in trouble.

05:04.438 --> 05:07.040
Hey, that Jet Ski
was a business expense.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.409
My conscience is clean.

05:08.509 --> 05:10.744
Your attention, please!

05:10.844 --> 05:13.080
This evening, I brought
six costume changes

05:13.180 --> 05:15.549
to be unveiled every hour,
on the hour.

05:15.649 --> 05:16.750
I hope you all
enjoy the journey.

05:16.850 --> 05:17.985
(doorbell rings)

05:18.085 --> 05:20.888
Anything that says "Vegas"
goes in there.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.224
Oh, good.
Another child.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.393
How's it going, man?

05:25.493 --> 05:26.560
Oh, fine.

05:26.660 --> 05:27.995
Besides a couple kids
who are too good

05:28.095 --> 05:29.430
for document shredding.

05:29.530 --> 05:32.332
Okay, hurry up. We're doing
my credit cards next.

05:33.501 --> 05:36.904
Well, seems like
you got it all under control.

05:37.004 --> 05:37.838
For now.

05:37.938 --> 05:39.840
But...in an hour,

05:39.940 --> 05:42.175
storm's a-comin'.

05:42.275 --> 05:43.877
Anyway, good luck.
W-W-Wait a minute.

05:43.977 --> 05:44.912
What do you mean "storm"?

05:45.012 --> 05:47.214
You know,
the sleepover storm.

05:47.314 --> 05:48.782
Kids stoned on sugar.

05:48.882 --> 05:51.118
One of them
pees in your cacti.

05:51.218 --> 05:53.754
Melted chocolate
in places you least expect it.

05:53.854 --> 05:57.224
Hmm. I suppose
it's illegal to drug 'em.

05:57.324 --> 05:58.559
You got this, man.

05:58.659 --> 06:01.762
Unless...
you want me to jump in...

06:01.862 --> 06:04.532
Yes! I mean, can you?
Are you available?

06:04.632 --> 06:05.699
Do you, uh, take checks?

06:05.799 --> 06:08.902
Let's see.
I was gonna do...

06:09.002 --> 06:10.137
Yes, I'm clear!

06:10.237 --> 06:12.773
Okay, good. I'm gonna go
tie one on, all right?

06:12.873 --> 06:15.142
Make sure
they finish the shredding.

06:18.746 --> 06:22.550
The window is opening,
and I'm climbing in.

06:22.650 --> 06:25.786
Dad, don't dance,
don't dance, don't --

06:27.421 --> 06:28.956
No.

06:31.659 --> 06:33.494
WILL: All right,
circle up, dudes.

06:33.594 --> 06:34.828
Important sleepover business.

06:34.928 --> 06:36.464
Miss this,
you'll be behind all night.

06:36.564 --> 06:38.265
If he's got a guitar,
I'm out of here.

06:38.365 --> 06:41.101
Ha-ha! Joke's on you.
Guitar's in the car,

06:41.201 --> 06:42.970
but I don't want to
hang out with you at all.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.639
'Cause I'm gonna be chillin'
with my boy Douglas.

06:45.739 --> 06:46.807
Dad! Dad! Dad!

06:46.907 --> 06:48.476
He just wants you
to watch us for him.

06:48.576 --> 06:49.610
He doesn't want to hang.

06:49.710 --> 06:51.178
Yeah, but he will
once I get us

06:51.278 --> 06:52.813
on the friendship train,
okay?

06:52.913 --> 06:54.648
So, you guys
just hold down the fort

06:54.748 --> 06:56.316
and, I don't know, be cool.

06:56.416 --> 06:57.818
Anyway, you don't need
constant supervision.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.453
(whirring)
I'm sorry, what is that?

06:59.553 --> 07:02.823
Emma and I are Shawshanking
our way to the neighbors'.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.092
I'm gonna pretend
I didn't see that.

07:05.192 --> 07:06.193
Have fun.

07:06.293 --> 07:08.028
Looking good!
(chuckles)

07:08.128 --> 07:10.163
Whoa!
What's in that thing?

07:10.263 --> 07:12.633
Just a photo of my mom...

07:12.733 --> 07:14.968
her scarf...
(sniffs)

07:15.068 --> 07:19.372
her lotion,
her gym shirt, and this!

07:19.473 --> 07:22.009
It projects stars
onto the ceiling

07:22.109 --> 07:23.511
to help me sleep.

07:23.611 --> 07:26.379
Not that I ever sleep
at these things.

07:26.480 --> 07:29.717
I always get scared
and call my mom.

07:29.817 --> 07:31.652
Like a real loser.

07:31.752 --> 07:34.321
Look at me.
I say you can do this.

07:34.421 --> 07:36.524
(pounding)

07:38.291 --> 07:39.527
MIGGY: Ahhhh.

07:39.627 --> 07:42.530
So, Miggy,
how's that job list coming?

07:42.630 --> 07:43.864
Maybe we could go over it.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.833
Oh, yeah, sure.
I always have it on me.

07:45.933 --> 07:47.501
So...

07:47.601 --> 07:49.236
Real talk, it's been hard
to find a job

07:49.336 --> 07:51.304
where I can get paid
and have childcare,

07:51.404 --> 07:53.040
but I think
I got some prospects.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.008
See, I've found
that abbreviated jobs

07:55.108 --> 07:56.076
make a lot of money.

07:56.176 --> 08:00.681
So, maybe like
CEO, CFO, UTI.

08:00.781 --> 08:04.017
Those are just titles
and a bladder infection.

08:04.117 --> 08:08.488
Aha. "Inventor,
apple-sauce hype man."

08:08.589 --> 08:09.857
Yeah!
"Patty Jenkins"?

08:09.957 --> 08:11.158
How is Patty Jenkins
a job?

08:11.258 --> 08:12.893
I don't know,
but I love Wonder Woman.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.662
God, Themyscira.
Oh, my God, that armor
was everything.

08:14.762 --> 08:17.064
And those boots!
And Amazonians!

08:17.164 --> 08:18.431
But you said to
focus on what I love.

08:18.532 --> 08:19.767
That's what you did,
right?

08:19.867 --> 08:21.401
And now
you've got this place.

08:21.501 --> 08:24.271
Yeah. I did say that.

08:24.371 --> 08:26.840
But let's try focusing on
options that are...

08:26.940 --> 08:28.108
more achievable.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.277
Great. You got it.
Starting fresh. Okay.

08:30.377 --> 08:32.713
Do not
write down "millionaire."

08:34.047 --> 08:35.282
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Okay.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.552
There's my guy!
Good news --

08:38.652 --> 08:40.253
kids are out of our hair.
We're set for the night.

08:40.353 --> 08:44.057
Really? You made it sound like
such a gigantic ordeal.

08:44.157 --> 08:46.760
Where there's a will,
there's a way.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.930
My name's Will.
Yeah.

08:50.030 --> 08:53.233
Pretty solid citrus collection
you got there.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.936
Look at this!

08:56.036 --> 08:57.304
Blended man.

08:57.404 --> 08:59.707
Kind of a single-malt guy
myself.

08:59.807 --> 09:02.810
Ah. Kind of imagined you
drinking Shirley Temples.

09:02.910 --> 09:06.947
(laughs)

09:07.047 --> 09:09.449
Hey, I'm just glad
you imagined me.

09:11.785 --> 09:15.255
Yeah. Well, all right,
I think it's about that time.

09:15.355 --> 09:16.590
Flip through
car magazines?

09:16.690 --> 09:17.758
No. For my sauna.

09:17.858 --> 09:19.392
Or that, too.

09:20.928 --> 09:22.262
You're right behind me,
aren't you?

09:22.362 --> 09:24.598
I've never shied away
from a sauna.

09:25.833 --> 09:28.101
Dude,
no patio is that slick.

09:28.201 --> 09:29.502
The gardener pushed her.

09:29.603 --> 09:31.972
OWEN: If a man is living
in a shack behind your house,

09:32.072 --> 09:34.307
he's gonna kill you.
Uh, yeah.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.843
I'm surprised she lasted
as long as she did.

09:35.943 --> 09:37.277
(cellphone rings)

09:37.377 --> 09:40.848
Oh, it's Graham.

09:40.948 --> 09:41.915
(cellphone dings)

09:42.015 --> 09:43.817
Sophie?
What's going on?

09:43.917 --> 09:45.485
Graham has
an announcement to make,

09:45.585 --> 09:47.254
and I fully endorse it.

09:47.354 --> 09:48.689
Here is your son.

09:49.757 --> 09:51.124
GRAHAM: Hello, Mother.

09:51.224 --> 09:54.795
I want you to know
I'm spending the night tonight.

09:57.030 --> 10:00.768
I will not need you
to pick me up.

10:00.868 --> 10:02.302
Uh, honey,
are you sure?

10:02.402 --> 10:05.839
Yes. Just...
know that I love you.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.775
No matter what happens...

10:07.875 --> 10:09.542
I love you.

10:09.643 --> 10:11.011
(cellphone beeps)

10:11.111 --> 10:12.980
Wait, does this mean
we're finally

10:13.080 --> 10:14.948
spending the night
together?

10:15.048 --> 10:16.984
I guess yeah, it does.

10:17.084 --> 10:18.952
(chuckles)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!
Oh.

10:19.052 --> 10:20.153
Come on,
let's get you into PJs!

10:20.253 --> 10:21.154
Okay.

10:21.254 --> 10:23.323
Ooh! You want
my Syracuse T-shirt?

10:23.423 --> 10:24.457
Super comfy.

10:24.557 --> 10:27.027
Oh, also, uh,
I fall asleep to Frasier.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.461
Do you like Frasier?

10:28.561 --> 10:29.529
There's so much
I don't know about you.

10:29.629 --> 10:30.998
I have so many questions.

10:32.065 --> 10:34.067
Poppy, great news!

10:34.167 --> 10:35.669
Graham decided
to sleep over,

10:35.769 --> 10:38.839
so that means that I get to
sleep over, too...

10:38.939 --> 10:40.173
at Owen's!

10:40.273 --> 10:41.408
(chuckles) Fun, huh?!

10:41.508 --> 10:43.844
Yeah.
So, why are you here?

10:43.944 --> 10:45.412
I left him in bed
and drove away

10:45.512 --> 10:47.047
like a crazy person.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.648
You're friends
with a crazy person.

10:48.749 --> 10:50.718
Yeah. Glass of wine?

10:53.320 --> 10:54.822
Lord have mercy!

10:56.089 --> 10:58.258
You have a sauna
in your house,

10:58.358 --> 11:00.728
and you only have
one robe?

11:00.828 --> 11:02.495
Really tells a story.

11:02.595 --> 11:04.064
Yep.

11:06.599 --> 11:10.570
Such a shame.
It is hot.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.773
Hot room.

11:14.341 --> 11:17.377
So, where are you from?

11:17.477 --> 11:19.412
Buffalo.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.715
Any siblings?

11:21.815 --> 11:23.283
Two sisters.

11:23.383 --> 11:25.953
One's a looker,
other's a miss.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.554
I would love
to meet them.

11:27.654 --> 11:29.122
Both dead.

11:29.222 --> 11:31.291
Whoa. Okay.

11:31.391 --> 11:33.360
Uh, favorite movie?

11:36.063 --> 11:37.530
(steam hisses)

11:37.630 --> 11:40.801
(chuckles)

11:40.901 --> 11:42.602
Wow. Okay.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.805
This -- This is fun.

11:44.905 --> 11:46.439
I think I will
take the sweatshirt off.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.776
You'll keep it on.

11:48.876 --> 11:50.710
Okay, Doug,
I'm just gonna say it.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.813
Feels like
you're trying to steam me out.

11:52.913 --> 11:54.581
Why are you so dead set
against being my friend?

11:54.681 --> 11:57.250
Because we have
nothing in common.
(scoffs)

11:57.350 --> 11:59.920
All I wanted was
a Saturday night by myself.

12:00.020 --> 12:03.223
Well,
a thousand pardons!

12:03.323 --> 12:05.158
You don't want to hang out
with me? That's fine.

12:05.258 --> 12:06.760
That's your loss.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.461
You act like
you don't need anybody,

12:08.561 --> 12:09.963
but I know
that's not true.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.732
You're lonely, Doug,
and it's your own fault.

12:12.833 --> 12:15.102
You push people away!
You put up walls!

12:15.202 --> 12:16.970
And yet, somehow,
you're still here.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.472
You know what? I never
should've taken your help.

12:19.572 --> 12:22.810
Hosting a sleepover
is a one-man job.

12:22.910 --> 12:25.445
I couldn't agree more!

12:25.545 --> 12:27.815
And I believe
you have two robes!

12:27.915 --> 12:30.317
Oh, no! My turtle!

12:30.417 --> 12:32.285
I-It's destroyed!

12:32.385 --> 12:34.154
So, there's been
a murder.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.155
But by whom?

12:35.255 --> 12:36.489
We did it.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.125
But we'll never know
when!

12:38.225 --> 12:39.426
Ten minutes ago.

12:39.526 --> 12:40.593
Okay, I give up.

12:40.693 --> 12:41.761
I-I need my turtle!

12:41.862 --> 12:43.831
I-I can't do this
without stars!

12:43.931 --> 12:45.265
I'm calling my mom.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.167
You don't need
your mom.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.802
(sighs)
AMY: We can make it up to you.

12:48.902 --> 12:51.038
Emma and I
can get you stars.

12:51.138 --> 12:54.774
(singing along)
* You love, you learn *

12:54.875 --> 12:57.277
* You cry, you learn *

12:57.377 --> 13:00.547
* You lo-ose, you learn *

13:00.647 --> 13:03.050
* You bleed, you learn *

13:03.150 --> 13:06.353
(song continues)
* You scream, you learn *

13:06.453 --> 13:07.855
What the hell?!

13:07.955 --> 13:09.022
Where are you going?

13:09.122 --> 13:10.390
To get a drink!

13:10.490 --> 13:11.859
I thought you were
watching the kids.

13:11.959 --> 13:13.626
I thought you were
watching the kids!

13:13.726 --> 13:16.363
Oh, this is a disaster.
I'm going back.

13:16.463 --> 13:17.865
I'm going back!

13:17.965 --> 13:19.299
(engine revs)

13:20.834 --> 13:23.170
You gotta be kidding me!

13:23.270 --> 13:25.038
I signaled
with my blinker!

13:25.138 --> 13:27.407
I want your
insurance information!

13:27.507 --> 13:29.076
You can get it
from my attorney!

13:29.176 --> 13:30.343
You don't have
an attorney!

13:30.443 --> 13:32.079
I'll find one!

13:32.179 --> 13:33.413
(metal scrapes)

13:33.513 --> 13:34.814
WILL:
You totally hit me!

13:34.915 --> 13:36.483
Oh, who taught you
how to drive, anyway?

13:36.583 --> 13:38.585
Mr. Murray,
my high school band teacher,

13:38.685 --> 13:40.888
who I'm still
in touch with!

13:40.988 --> 13:42.822
Oh, my God.

13:42.923 --> 13:44.424
They're gone.

13:48.261 --> 13:49.496
Look at me.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.031
I finally have a chance --

13:51.131 --> 13:52.099
There you go --

13:52.199 --> 13:53.934
to spend the night
with Owen,

13:54.034 --> 13:57.404
and here I am,
drinking with you.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.172
Ang, do you know why

13:59.272 --> 14:00.874
I had a bottle of White Zin
on ice tonight?

14:00.974 --> 14:03.210
Mmm! Because
it's the freakin' best.

14:03.310 --> 14:04.611
It's literally the worst wine
in the world,

14:04.711 --> 14:05.946
and you have the palate
of a basic bitch,

14:06.046 --> 14:07.380
and we'll
get to that later.

14:07.480 --> 14:08.348
But no.

14:08.448 --> 14:09.716
It's because
this is what you do.

14:09.816 --> 14:11.451
Every time
you get close to a guy,

14:11.551 --> 14:14.955
you wind up back in this seat,
making excuses.

14:15.055 --> 14:16.589
Wait, really?
Yes.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.458
I don't even carry White Zin.
Every time you do this,

14:18.558 --> 14:20.193
I have to go pick it up
from a gas station.

14:20.293 --> 14:23.430
Oh, my God.
I'm so screwed up.

14:23.530 --> 14:26.099
You're not screwed up.
You're just scared.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.867
Look, what happened
with Graham's dad,

14:27.968 --> 14:29.469
I know,
it was years ago.

14:29.569 --> 14:31.939
But he left,
and that had to have hurt.

14:32.039 --> 14:34.374
(sighs)
Whatever. He's a jerk.

14:34.474 --> 14:37.577
Yeah, but at some point,
you must've cared about him.

14:37.677 --> 14:40.380
Yeah, I don't know,
for some reason I loved him.

14:40.480 --> 14:41.714
Been there.

14:41.814 --> 14:44.151
We've all been with people
who sucked.

14:44.251 --> 14:47.154
But what if I just don't know
how to pick people?

14:47.254 --> 14:48.755
What if my radar's off,

14:48.855 --> 14:50.557
and there's all these
red flags

14:50.657 --> 14:52.960
that everyone else sees
and I just miss?

14:53.060 --> 14:55.428
Well, there's no guarantees.
Owen could suck, too.

14:55.528 --> 14:57.464
But you'll never know
if you don't give him

14:57.564 --> 14:59.099
more than 90 minutes.

14:59.199 --> 15:00.433
I think you like him.

15:00.533 --> 15:02.802
He was gonna make me
blueberry pancakes.

15:02.936 --> 15:05.305
Oh, Ang, that's huge.
Mm-hmm.

15:05.405 --> 15:06.673
You gotta
give him a chance.

15:06.773 --> 15:09.576
You're right.
I'm gonna do it.
Do it.

15:09.676 --> 15:12.112
I'm gonna go
get in that bed.

15:12.212 --> 15:13.313
You're gonna
give me those keys.

15:13.413 --> 15:14.747
I'm gonna
give you those keys, yeah.

15:14.847 --> 15:17.284
I'm gonna get in that bed.
Yep. Do it.

15:17.384 --> 15:18.318
I want a full report.

15:18.418 --> 15:19.586
Yo, Poppy?

15:19.686 --> 15:21.788
Yo, I got it.
I have the perfect job.

15:22.855 --> 15:25.358
I'm gonna be
a celebrity chef.

15:26.359 --> 15:27.961
That's your
realistic job option?

15:28.061 --> 15:29.629
Yeah.
Okay, Miggy, enough.

15:29.729 --> 15:31.931
You're not gonna be
a celebrity chef.
How do you know?

15:32.032 --> 15:33.700
Because you're not
a celebrity...or a chef.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.102
Well, not yet.

15:35.202 --> 15:37.104
But you should see the purees
I put together for Jack.

15:37.204 --> 15:39.139
I mean, they're just
totally out the box.

15:39.239 --> 15:41.041
I'll put a mango in
with a strawberry. Mmm!

15:41.141 --> 15:42.642
A spinach
next to a banana. Unh!

15:42.742 --> 15:44.511
I don't even care!
Okrrrt!

15:44.611 --> 15:45.979
Miggy, none of that
qualifies you

15:46.079 --> 15:47.314
to be a celebrity chef.

15:47.414 --> 15:49.182
Well, but you told me
to dream big.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.218
Look, Miggy, I know I told you
to follow your bliss,

15:51.318 --> 15:53.653
but you need to follow it
to a paycheck.

15:55.322 --> 15:56.689
Rent's due.

15:57.824 --> 15:58.958
Dang.

15:59.059 --> 16:00.360
(Jack fusses)

16:00.460 --> 16:02.395
You know, I feel like you didn't
have my back there, buddy.

16:02.495 --> 16:03.663
(scoffs)

16:03.763 --> 16:06.233
I-I don't get it.
Where would they go?

16:06.333 --> 16:07.634
I knew I should've
micro-chipped Sophie!

16:07.734 --> 16:09.069
Oh, okay.
All right, just relax.

16:09.169 --> 16:10.870
Maybe they went through
the Shawshank tunnel.

16:12.205 --> 16:14.307
I'm going in.

16:14.407 --> 16:15.842
(taps)
Oh, yeah.
They didn't get very far.

16:15.942 --> 16:17.677
Yeah, I re-plaster that
every month.

16:17.777 --> 16:19.712
It keeps 'em busy.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.381
O-Okay, look!
Look. Here's a note.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.750
"We went to the golf course
to find stars."

16:23.850 --> 16:26.053
Okay? Relax.
Everything's fine.

16:26.153 --> 16:27.254
How is everything fine?

16:27.354 --> 16:29.022
They could be on any golf course
in the city!

16:30.157 --> 16:33.060
The golf course
is my backyard.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.527
You live
on a golf course?

16:34.627 --> 16:38.598
No, I get in a car
and I drive to play golf.

16:38.698 --> 16:40.433
Moron.

16:40.533 --> 16:43.703
**

16:43.803 --> 16:49.042
Hey. I, uh...
I didn't go to get mouthwash.

16:49.142 --> 16:52.412
Yeah, I figured.
It's been two hours.

16:52.512 --> 16:55.115
Look, I'm scared, okay?

16:55.215 --> 16:58.785
I -- I never usually get
this far in a relationship.

16:58.885 --> 17:01.454
But that changes tonight,
okay?

17:01.554 --> 17:04.023
I don't really know
what's gonna happen.

17:04.124 --> 17:07.060
I might get scared
and run away again...

17:07.160 --> 17:10.230
but I'm getting
in that bed.

17:10.330 --> 17:12.365
Okay.
Okay.

17:12.465 --> 17:15.102
I'm gonna get under.

17:15.202 --> 17:16.469
She's in.
I'm in.

17:16.569 --> 17:17.604
(both chuckle)

17:17.704 --> 17:18.871
Under the covers.

17:18.971 --> 17:21.108
(both chuckle)

17:21.208 --> 17:22.609
(sighs)

17:22.709 --> 17:24.544
Doing it.
I'm doing it.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.213
(cellphone vibrates)

17:28.648 --> 17:30.717
Oh, my God.

17:30.817 --> 17:32.752
My kid's on a golf course.
I gotta go.

17:32.852 --> 17:34.221
Okay.

17:34.321 --> 17:37.424
You know, for the record,

17:37.524 --> 17:39.626
the golf course is real,
mouthwash fake.

17:39.726 --> 17:40.927
Golf course, real.

17:41.027 --> 17:43.096
Well, for the record,
I really enjoyed

17:43.196 --> 17:46.966
all five seconds of...
whatever it is we just did.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.635
(chuckles)

17:49.669 --> 17:52.105
WILL: This place is huge.
They could be anywhere.

17:52.205 --> 17:53.973
All right, relax.
If they have any taste,

17:54.073 --> 17:55.308
they'll be
on the fourth hole.

17:55.408 --> 17:56.909
This is my fault.

17:57.009 --> 17:59.246
I just -- I wanted
a guys' night, you know?

17:59.346 --> 18:00.480
Back when I worked
at The Weather Channel,

18:00.580 --> 18:01.681
I had my dudes.

18:01.781 --> 18:03.350
And then,
when I started freelancing

18:03.450 --> 18:05.118
to be closer to Sophie,

18:05.218 --> 18:07.086
they all kind of
fell away.

18:07.187 --> 18:08.255
I-I miss it.

18:08.355 --> 18:10.123
Yeah, well,
men need other men.

18:10.223 --> 18:12.159
It's in our DNA
to form clans.

18:12.259 --> 18:15.495
That's why I have
my dermatology crew.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.164
Right, you already have
your friends.

18:17.264 --> 18:19.266
I get it.

18:19.366 --> 18:22.034
I promise
I won't bother you anymore.

18:24.371 --> 18:25.638
But they really don't
understand

18:25.738 --> 18:27.540
the parenting thing,
my crew.

18:27.640 --> 18:30.143
You know,
especially parenting girls.

18:30.243 --> 18:32.345
Right? I mean, that's
a whole different thing.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.347
Oh, boy.
Don't get me started
on bobby pins.

18:34.447 --> 18:35.682
Yeah,
what is with that?

18:35.782 --> 18:37.650
I-I'll always step on 'em,
but when I need one --

18:37.750 --> 18:39.118
They disappear.
Yeah.

18:39.219 --> 18:40.853
They're everywhere and nowhere
at the same time.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.155
Exactly.
Yeah.

18:42.255 --> 18:44.357
It makes zero sense.

18:44.457 --> 18:47.026
Listen, you know,
you were right back there.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.861
The whole thing
about the walls.

18:48.961 --> 18:52.165
No one's ever had the dice
to call me out before.

18:52.265 --> 18:53.166
I'm sorry.

18:53.266 --> 18:54.401
I think
it was a combination

18:54.501 --> 18:56.469
of the dry heat
and the wet jeans.

18:56.569 --> 18:58.538
No, I mean it.

18:58.638 --> 18:59.972
Thank you.

19:02.008 --> 19:03.142
There are the kids.

19:03.243 --> 19:04.344
Oh, they're laying
on their backs.

19:04.444 --> 19:05.478
I think
the coyotes got 'em!

19:05.578 --> 19:06.579
Sophie!
Calm down.

19:06.679 --> 19:08.147
They're looking up
at the stars.

19:08.248 --> 19:09.649
Sophie!
There they are!

19:09.749 --> 19:11.184
Douglas,
what the hell?

19:11.284 --> 19:13.052
Why am I getting texts that
my kid's on a golf course?

19:13.152 --> 19:15.588
I-I-I'm sorry.
I'm bad at this.

19:15.688 --> 19:17.056
No, it's my fault.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.726
I-I told the kids they don't
need adult supervision --

19:19.826 --> 19:21.494
It's both of our faults.

19:21.594 --> 19:23.430
We were
having a guys' night.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.999
(scoffs)
You hug me, and it's over.

19:27.099 --> 19:29.202
I'm not.
Well, let's all
just be grateful that

19:29.302 --> 19:32.405
Douglas lives on a golf course
like a cartoon millionaire.

19:32.505 --> 19:35.007
**

19:35.107 --> 19:36.276
Hi.

19:36.376 --> 19:38.911
God, Rory. You look like
one of the Mandrell Sisters.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.513
Barbara?

19:40.613 --> 19:41.681
Sure.

19:41.781 --> 19:46.886
**

19:46.986 --> 19:48.455
He did it.

19:48.555 --> 19:49.789
You will, too.

19:49.889 --> 19:53.460
* We could ride
to the stars today *

19:53.560 --> 19:57.397
* We could ride
to the stars today *

19:57.497 --> 19:58.765
(click, water spraying)

19:58.865 --> 20:00.400
WILL:
Do you guys hear that?

20:00.500 --> 20:02.269
Oh, my God! Sprinklers!

20:02.369 --> 20:03.436
(all screaming)

20:03.536 --> 20:05.805
RORY: Never again
with this chiffon!

20:09.141 --> 20:11.911
Hey. Guess what.
I'm doing it.

20:12.011 --> 20:13.313
Putting myself out there
with Owen.

20:13.413 --> 20:16.416
You sent him a pancake
and a blueberry emoji?

20:16.516 --> 20:19.319
Intimacy.
I'm doing it!

20:19.419 --> 20:20.587
Yo, Pop,
I made a new list.

20:20.687 --> 20:21.654
Oh, God.

20:21.754 --> 20:23.823
No. There's only
one thing on it.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.926
You want to work for me
at the Winebrary?

20:27.026 --> 20:27.927
Yep.

20:28.027 --> 20:29.996
Huh. I could actually
use the help.

20:30.096 --> 20:31.130
Yeah?

20:31.230 --> 20:32.231
All right.

20:32.332 --> 20:33.266
You can apply online.

20:33.366 --> 20:35.268
Oh! Come on.
Ha-ha! Kidding.

20:35.368 --> 20:36.269
You're hired.

20:36.369 --> 20:37.470
Yeah!
Yeah.

20:37.570 --> 20:38.638
Bye, Dad!
Enjoy your breakfast!

20:38.738 --> 20:39.906
Thank you, Soph.

20:40.006 --> 20:41.341
Early morning steak
not so bad, huh?

20:41.441 --> 20:44.010
Ahh. I can feel my arteries
bracing. I love it!

20:44.110 --> 20:46.679
Mmm. Now, this
is a single malt.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.015
Is that liquor?

20:49.115 --> 20:50.650
On school property?

20:50.750 --> 20:52.819
Tell you what.
Here, take a walk.

20:52.919 --> 20:55.187
Yeah, we're trying
to enjoy a meal here.

20:55.288 --> 20:57.123
I'm so sorry,
Miss Adams.

20:57.223 --> 21:01.160
**

21:01.260 --> 21:02.795
You gonna eat
that last piece?

21:02.895 --> 21:04.464
You want to attack it
from both sides,

21:04.564 --> 21:06.333
Lady and the Tramp style?

21:06.433 --> 21:09.502
No, I'm -- I'm kidding.
You go ahead and take it.

21:10.202 --> 21:12.271
Gosh, I love
seeing you happy.
