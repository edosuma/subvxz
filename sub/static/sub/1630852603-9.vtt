was a joke,

32:27.820 --> 32:30.156
that I wasn't taken seriously.

32:30.239 --> 32:31.991
- Saving children
from burning in hell,

32:32.075 --> 32:33.576
that's very important.

that we need muscle men

33:09.821 --> 33:11.531

desert with these kids.

33:13.491 --> 33:14.534
It'd be just as gratifying.

No adults.
Just us and these children.
