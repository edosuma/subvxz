WEBVTT

00:02.585 --> 00:04.920
I'm gonna get more coffee,
do you want anything, baby doll?

00:05.130 --> 00:06.463
I'm fine. Thanks.

00:07.132 --> 00:08.966
See, I can't pull off "baby doll," can I?

00:09.175 --> 00:12.678
No, I think we learned that
from the "sugar lips" incident.

00:13.388 --> 00:15.305
- I'm gonna get some tea.
- Okay.

00:15.473 --> 00:17.057
How you doing, pumpkin?

00:17.350 --> 00:18.726
Nope.

00:19.728 --> 00:22.396
- So it looks like it's going well for you two.
- I know. Really well.

00:22.564 --> 00:25.232
In fact, I'm gonna ask Phoebe
to move in with me.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.484
- Oh, my God.
- What do you think?

00:27.736 --> 00:29.737
I think that it's great.
When are you gonna ask her?

00:29.946 --> 00:33.449
- Tonight. But don't say anything, okay?
- I swear. I promise. I promise.

00:33.700 --> 00:34.992
My God, I'm so excited.

00:35.201 --> 00:37.494
But listen, do not get her flowers, okay?

00:37.746 --> 00:41.290
Because she cries when they die,
then there's the whole funeral.

00:43.543 --> 00:46.879
- I'll see you after work, sweetie.
- Okay. Bye.

00:48.381 --> 00:50.591
So, what movie should we see?

00:50.925 --> 00:53.343
Gary's gonna ask you
to move in with him.

00:54.804 --> 00:55.846
What? Really?

00:56.056 --> 00:58.390
He told me at the counter.
He made me promise not to tell...

00:58.558 --> 01:00.768
...but I couldn't hold it in any longer.

01:00.935 --> 01:02.061
I can't believe this.

01:02.270 --> 01:05.689
Right? Because it's fast.
Because it's so fast. It's fast.

01:06.775 --> 01:09.568
- Relax. It's Phoebe, not you.
- Oh.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.737
Good for you, Pheebs. Way to go.

01:11.988 --> 01:14.656
- No, but it is fast, isn't it?
- No.

01:14.824 --> 01:18.243
- I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready.
- So, what are you gonna do?

01:18.495 --> 01:22.331
I don't know. I'll just handle it.
I'll ask you to talk to him.

01:23.041 --> 01:24.083
Me? Why me?

01:24.292 --> 01:26.335
Because you are
so afraid of commitment.

01:26.544 --> 01:30.464
You talk to him. Make him scared
like you, make him a man.

01:31.257 --> 01:33.258
I'll try, but I'm not sure
what good it would do...

01:33.426 --> 01:36.470
...because I'm less afraid of commitment
than I used to be.

01:36.679 --> 01:38.806
That is so sweet.

01:39.432 --> 01:42.142
Still terrified.
I'll take care of it no problem.

02:38.032 --> 02:41.118
Hey, Ross, is, uh, Staten Island
really an island?

02:41.286 --> 02:45.080
Uh-huh. That's why they call it
Staten "Island."

02:45.456 --> 02:48.292
Oh, I thought it was like Long Island.

02:53.798 --> 02:55.215
Also an island.

02:57.051 --> 02:59.052
- Hey, what time is it?
- Two seventeen.

02:59.971 --> 03:03.807
Wow, you realize we've been throwing
this ball without dropping it for an hour?

03:04.434 --> 03:05.475
Are you serious?

03:05.643 --> 03:08.437
Yeah, I realized it a half-hour ago,
but I didn't wanna say anything...

03:08.605 --> 03:10.856
...because I didn't wanna jinx it.

03:11.065 --> 03:13.025
Wow, we are pretty good at this.

03:14.819 --> 03:16.653
Hey, we totally forgot about lunch.

03:18.239 --> 03:20.908
I think that's the first time
I've ever missed a meal.

03:21.117 --> 03:23.243
I think my pants are a little loose.

03:27.790 --> 03:29.875
Hey, you guys. Uh, is Monica here?

03:30.084 --> 03:31.251
- No.
- No.

03:31.502 --> 03:34.046
Listen, um, I bought something.
I'm not sure she's gonna like it.

03:34.255 --> 03:35.505
And it's gonna seem crazy...

03:35.673 --> 03:38.175
...but this is something I've wanted
since I was a little girl.

03:38.343 --> 03:40.344
You bought Shaun Cassidy.

03:41.346 --> 03:42.554
No. I wish.

03:42.764 --> 03:44.139
Okay, you ready?

03:44.307 --> 03:45.349
Yeah.

03:48.645 --> 03:50.103
Check it out.

03:55.109 --> 03:58.278
- Oh, my God. What is it?
- What the hell is that?

03:59.781 --> 04:02.532
- It's a cat.
- That is not a cat.

04:03.952 --> 04:05.118
Yes, it is.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.621
Why is it inside out?

04:11.626 --> 04:17.380
Excuse me, but this is a purebred,
show-quality sphinx cat.

04:17.632 --> 04:20.091
How much did you pay for that?

04:20.301 --> 04:22.678
Well, it was a little extravagant,
but I got a good deal.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.763
- Yeah, how much?
- Thousand bucks.

04:26.849 --> 04:28.100
On a cat?

04:29.435 --> 04:30.769
It's not a cat.

04:32.730 --> 04:34.606
All right. Listen, ball boys.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.775
My grandmother had one of these
when I was little...

04:36.943 --> 04:38.443
...and it was the sweetest thing.

04:38.653 --> 04:41.780
I mean, it was so cute, it would sit
in my lap and just purr all day long...

04:41.990 --> 04:44.866
...and I would drag a shoe string
on the ground and it would chase it.

04:45.076 --> 04:47.035
Free cats do that too, you know.

04:48.162 --> 04:49.746
It's not a cat.

04:50.164 --> 04:52.082
Look, guys,
I'm really excited about this, okay?

04:52.250 --> 04:53.750
I don't care what you think.

04:54.002 --> 04:57.254
I'm gonna go set up a little litter box
for Mrs. Whiskerson.

04:58.798 --> 05:01.008
Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?

05:05.096 --> 05:06.930
Hey, do you wanna get something to eat
or, uh...

05:07.098 --> 05:09.474
...see how long we can throw this ball
back and forth?

05:09.642 --> 05:12.477
- Uh, the ball thing.
- Yeah?

05:14.022 --> 05:17.524
Hey, Ross, wouldn't it be great
if we could go for like two straight hours...

05:17.692 --> 05:19.109
...without dropping it?

05:19.277 --> 05:22.279
Uh, yeah, it would.

05:23.489 --> 05:24.990
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

05:28.578 --> 05:30.162
- Uh-oh.
- What?

05:30.330 --> 05:31.830
I have to pee.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.166
And Rachel's in the bathroom.

05:39.047 --> 05:41.548
Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it.

05:42.383 --> 05:43.675
I know.

05:43.926 --> 05:45.969
Don't switch hands, okay?

05:54.145 --> 05:55.812
Hey, ladies.
What are you in here for?

06:00.818 --> 06:02.402
Hey, Chandler, what are you doing here?

06:02.570 --> 06:04.613
- Gary, I am here to report a crime.
- Yeah?

06:04.781 --> 06:06.948
It is a crime that you and I
don't spend time together.

06:07.116 --> 06:08.492
Ha, ha. What's up?

06:10.036 --> 06:13.288
Uh, well, I heard that you were thinking
about asking Phoebe to move in with you...

06:13.456 --> 06:17.376
...and I thought maybe we should have
a talk, you know, man to... well, me.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.836
Sure, okay.

06:20.421 --> 06:22.172
Um, are you crazy?

06:22.715 --> 06:23.882
Are you insane?

06:24.092 --> 06:28.136
If you live with Phoebe, you two
are gonna be, you know, living together.

06:28.554 --> 06:30.806
Yeah, I considered that.
I just know it'd make me happy.

06:30.973 --> 06:33.308
- Heh. You mean scared.
- No, I mean happy.

06:33.976 --> 06:35.894
Scared happy.

06:36.604 --> 06:39.606
- Chandler, what are you doing?
- I'm trying to open your eyes, my man.

06:39.816 --> 06:42.609
Don't you see? If you live with Phoebe,
she is always gonna be there.

06:42.860 --> 06:45.821
You're gonna get home, she's there.
You go to bed, she's there.

06:46.072 --> 06:48.740
You wake up and oh, yes, she's there.

06:49.409 --> 06:50.867
I know. I can't wait.

06:51.911 --> 06:54.663
Were your parents happy or something?

06:55.498 --> 06:56.957
Listen, Chandler, the way I see it...

06:57.125 --> 06:59.501
...I was lucky enough to find someone
that I really love.

06:59.669 --> 07:02.379
I just wanna be around her
as much as I can.

07:02.880 --> 07:05.632
Wow, you know, when you say it,
it doesn't sound so scary.

07:05.842 --> 07:09.094
- So you know what I'm talking about?
- Yeah, I think I do.

07:09.345 --> 07:10.470
You know what?

07:10.680 --> 07:13.473
You move in with her.
You move in right with her right now.

07:13.641 --> 07:16.560
- Maybe I should move in with Monica.
- No, it's too soon for you guys.

07:18.729 --> 07:20.856
You're right about that.

07:23.943 --> 07:26.653
When they found the remains
of the Mesozoic mastodon...

07:26.863 --> 07:29.489
...they discovered what appeared
to be the remains...

07:29.740 --> 07:33.118
...of a Paleozoic amphibian in its jaws.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.413
How did it get there?

07:38.458 --> 07:40.542
Maybe this should be more
of a quiet game.

07:43.254 --> 07:44.629
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

07:44.839 --> 07:47.007
Joey, I left my watch
on the counter last night.

07:47.175 --> 07:48.925
- It was here. Where is it?
- I don't know.

07:49.260 --> 07:50.594
Well, come on, I'm late for work.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.804
How do you know?
You don't have a watch.

07:54.807 --> 07:58.560
Guys, could you stop throwing the ball
for one minute and just help me find it?

07:58.811 --> 08:01.188
Oh, I don't know. Yeah, can't do it.

08:06.694 --> 08:08.945
- What?
- Whatever you do, do not drop that ball.

08:09.155 --> 08:12.616
- Yeah, we haven't dropped it in...
- Two hours, 27 minutes.

08:13.993 --> 08:15.452
Really?

08:16.496 --> 08:18.538
I'm not gonna be able
to make it in to work today.

08:19.123 --> 08:20.832
Um, I don't feel very good.

08:21.918 --> 08:22.959
Yes!

08:24.587 --> 08:28.298
Wow, uh, for a second there,
I thought I was feeling better, but I'm not.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.052
- Hey, Rach.
- Hey.

08:32.260 --> 08:36.014
Check it out. Almost three hours
without dropping it.

08:36.265 --> 08:39.518
Wow, congratulations.
That's quite a waste of time.

08:41.395 --> 08:42.437
- Rach.
- Yeah.

08:42.605 --> 08:44.439
You have scratches all over you.
What happened?

08:44.607 --> 08:46.942
- Well, it's my cat.
- What?

08:47.151 --> 08:49.402
- Oh, yeah, I got a cat.
- I don't want a cat.

08:49.654 --> 08:52.030
- Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.
- Yeah.

08:53.115 --> 08:56.826
You guys, this cat is nothing like
my grandmother's cat.

08:57.036 --> 08:58.954
It's not sweet. It's not cute.

08:59.205 --> 09:01.122
I even dragged a string on the ground...

09:01.290 --> 09:04.334
...and it just flipped out
and scratched the hell out of me.

09:05.795 --> 09:09.923
And I swear... I know this sounds crazy,
but every time this cat hisses at me...

09:10.132 --> 09:12.175
...I know it's saying, "Rachel."

09:18.933 --> 09:22.269
Doesn't sound as crazy
as paying $1000 for a cat.

09:23.020 --> 09:25.772
You paid $1000 for a cat
when you owe me 300?

09:25.982 --> 09:28.817
Well, I was gonna let you play with it.

09:35.324 --> 09:36.616
Hey.

09:36.784 --> 09:38.618
Did you talk to Gary
about the moving in thing?

09:38.786 --> 09:41.830
- Yes, I did, and I think you should do it.
- What?

09:42.039 --> 09:46.793
He's a great guy and he loves you a lot.
You are a very lucky lady.

09:47.378 --> 09:48.878
You are useless.

09:50.548 --> 09:53.508
Freaking out about commitment
is the one thing you can do...

09:53.718 --> 09:55.719
...and you can't even do that right. God.

09:55.928 --> 09:58.638
Sorry. If he asked me,
I'd move in with him.

09:58.806 --> 10:00.265
Oh!

10:02.310 --> 10:04.185
Ooh, ooh, get out of here,
good-for-nothing.

10:06.897 --> 10:09.899
- Hey, Chandler.
- Hey, Gar.

10:11.527 --> 10:12.986
Hey, sweetie.

10:13.195 --> 10:17.574
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah. Okay.

10:18.367 --> 10:21.328
- You look very pretty today.
- Thanks. Okay.

10:22.872 --> 10:23.913
- Here's the thing.
- Yeah.

10:24.123 --> 10:27.208
You know, I really want this relationship
to move forward.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.670
Because if you're not moving forward,
you know, you're just moving backwards.

10:30.921 --> 10:33.882
Now, that's not true. If you're not
moving forward, you're staying still.

10:34.133 --> 10:36.968
And staying still is good. Watch this.

10:39.263 --> 10:40.722
- Phoebe?
- Yeah?

10:41.432 --> 10:42.766
I want you to move in with me.

10:43.726 --> 10:45.727
That is so sweet.

10:46.020 --> 10:48.271
But don't you think
that it's a little it's too soon?

10:48.522 --> 10:50.774
I mean, there's so much
we don't know about each other.

10:52.443 --> 10:53.943
Oh.

10:54.570 --> 10:56.404
Oh, okay. I get it.

10:57.907 --> 11:01.618
I don't want us to jump into something
that we're not ready for, you know.

11:02.662 --> 11:03.703
Uh-huh.

11:05.831 --> 11:08.083
I really don't want
to mess up what we have.

11:08.334 --> 11:11.711
I'm just worried it's gonna
be a big mistake.

11:11.879 --> 11:13.296
Yeah.

11:14.965 --> 11:18.134
Which is why my answer is yes.

11:19.595 --> 11:21.012
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

11:21.263 --> 11:23.223
You're so happy.

11:29.939 --> 11:32.107
Monica, stop throwing it so hard.

11:34.193 --> 11:35.902
We're on the same team.

11:37.905 --> 11:40.615
Four hours? You guys have been
doing this for four hours?

11:40.866 --> 11:42.283
That's right, baby.

11:42.535 --> 11:45.161
- All right. Let me in.
- No, no. Don't do it.

11:45.955 --> 11:47.372
What?

11:48.457 --> 11:50.125
He's a dropper.

11:52.044 --> 11:53.962
Oh, yeah. That's right.

11:54.171 --> 11:55.714
I'm not a dropper.

11:56.173 --> 11:59.342
It's really a three-person game,
you know?

12:00.469 --> 12:02.470
It's throwing and catching.

12:03.305 --> 12:04.764
All right.

12:08.185 --> 12:09.769
Oh, oh, it's so hard.

12:17.486 --> 12:19.904
Don't worry, guys.
It's not a cat.

12:22.366 --> 12:24.409
Oh, my... Oh, good God.

12:24.618 --> 12:27.912
I give up, you guys. I don't know
what I'm gonna do with this thing.

12:28.914 --> 12:30.498
Baking it didn't help, huh?

12:33.461 --> 12:35.462
Why don't you just take it back
to where you got it?

12:35.671 --> 12:37.589
I tried. They won't take her back.

12:37.798 --> 12:41.259
Maybe that's because
she's a minion of the Antichrist.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.263
Rach, why won't they take it back?

12:45.473 --> 12:47.974
Well, they said they would,
but would only give me store credit.

12:48.225 --> 12:51.519
What am I gonna do,
get a thousand regular cats?

12:52.062 --> 12:54.731
If you want, you can keep it
until you find out what to do with it.

12:54.940 --> 12:57.317
No, Mon, that's not the point.
I'm out a thousand dollars...

12:57.485 --> 12:59.027
...I'm all scratched up...

12:59.236 --> 13:02.614
...and I'm stuck with this stupid cat
that looks like a hand.

13:07.119 --> 13:08.161
Oh, my God.

13:08.370 --> 13:11.122
The cat's made my eyes water.
Don't throw it to me.

13:11.332 --> 13:14.000
My vision's been compromised.

13:15.252 --> 13:18.087
Oh, God. Okay. Okay.

13:18.255 --> 13:20.465
It's okay. Man, that was close.

13:20.716 --> 13:23.384
Yeah, you almost overreacted
to something.

13:25.137 --> 13:26.679
Hey.

13:26.972 --> 13:29.432
- We have great news.
- We're moving in together. Isn't it great?

13:29.600 --> 13:30.642
Yay!

13:31.936 --> 13:33.561
- Congratulations.
- That's great.

13:33.771 --> 13:35.271
- I know, I'm so excited.
- So am I.

13:35.481 --> 13:39.192
Well, you're not more excited than I am.
No way. I'm the most excited. Ha.

13:39.735 --> 13:41.319
Okay, I'll see you at the station later.

13:41.529 --> 13:44.489
Okay, yeah, I'll see you later.
Don't forget about the moving-in.

13:45.991 --> 13:47.700
So you're moving in with him?
What happened?

13:47.910 --> 13:51.871
I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad.
But maybe it'll be all right.

13:52.373 --> 13:53.623
I do really like him a lot...

13:53.833 --> 13:56.543
...and probably do it eventually anyway.

13:56.794 --> 13:59.796
And plus, think of all the money
I'll save on stamps.

14:00.923 --> 14:02.215
Why, do you write him a lot?

14:02.550 --> 14:04.551
No, I just heard
when people live together...

14:04.718 --> 14:07.178
...they split the cost
of stamps, don't they?

14:10.057 --> 14:11.891
- Yeah, yeah.
- That's right.

14:13.769 --> 14:15.812
Oh! Oh.

14:15.980 --> 14:18.314
I'm sorry, the oven mitts
really freaked me out.

14:25.906 --> 14:27.407
Hey, honey.

14:28.492 --> 14:30.660
Did you find any apartments
in Brooklyn Heights?

14:30.870 --> 14:32.036
No, nothing.

14:32.413 --> 14:33.496
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

14:33.747 --> 14:35.039
- Nothing at all?
- No.

14:35.249 --> 14:37.125
As soon as something opens up,
we'll move in.

14:37.293 --> 14:39.335
Unless it doesn't have a pool.
I need a pool.

14:41.672 --> 14:44.591
- Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
- Uh-huh.

14:47.094 --> 14:48.678
Take a seat.

14:50.097 --> 14:53.474
You okay? You feel all right?

14:54.184 --> 14:56.644
Yeah, I feel great because
we're moving in together.

14:57.730 --> 14:58.938
So you, uh...

14:59.189 --> 15:02.859
You checked the paper for listings
in Brooklyn Heights, right?

15:04.361 --> 15:05.612
You checked the Post?

15:06.572 --> 15:08.364
Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.868
- Can I get some water?
- In a minute.

15:14.413 --> 15:18.082
- You checked today's Post?
- Um, yeah, today's.

15:18.292 --> 15:21.461
Hmm. Because, uh, this is today's Post.

15:21.712 --> 15:24.130
And, uh, these are the listings I found.

15:25.049 --> 15:28.134
Brooklyn Heights, two bedrooms.
Brooklyn Heights, one bedroom.

15:28.344 --> 15:31.512
Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights,
Brooklyn Heights.

15:32.097 --> 15:36.559
Oh, are these for rent?
I thought people were just bragging.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.437
Let me tell you what I think
might be going on here.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.689
No, no, don't look at the table.
Look at me.

15:43.150 --> 15:46.277
Okay, I think somebody asked someone
to move in with him.

15:46.528 --> 15:49.322
And I think someone said yes,
but now she's having doubts...

15:49.490 --> 15:51.449
...because things are moving too fast
for someone.

15:51.617 --> 15:53.868
Does that sound at all possible to you?

15:54.787 --> 15:58.539
Yes, yes. Yes, fine, I am someone.

16:00.292 --> 16:02.752
You want me to say it? I have doubts.

16:03.003 --> 16:04.796
I'm sorry.

16:05.923 --> 16:07.757
- Phoebe.
- Yeah?

16:08.008 --> 16:10.259
Phoebe, it's okay that you feel this way.

16:10.511 --> 16:14.430
I mean, it is soon, and there's a lot of
things we don't know about each other.

16:14.682 --> 16:17.141
I just figured everything I know about you,
I really like.

16:17.351 --> 16:21.562
The things I don't know, I get to learn in a
place with both our names on the mailbox.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.607
That's so sweet.

16:24.984 --> 16:28.319
Sweetheart, but none of that matters
if it's too soon for you.

16:28.487 --> 16:31.948
It's fine. We don't have to move in together.
I just want you to be happy.

16:32.783 --> 16:35.785
- Living with you would make me happy.
- Phoebe, you don't have to say that.

16:36.036 --> 16:38.830
No, I really wanna live with you.
I wanna move in with you.

16:39.039 --> 16:41.124
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

16:41.291 --> 16:44.627
Definitely, yes. Let's live in an apartment
that we both live in.

16:44.878 --> 16:47.797
- Oh, that's great.
- Oh, wait, one sec. One sec.

16:48.424 --> 16:52.051
Hey, you. Behind the glass.
Who are you looking at?

16:53.262 --> 16:56.097
I've always wanted to say that every time
I was in one of these rooms...

16:56.265 --> 16:57.765
...which was never.

17:00.936 --> 17:04.731
Show cat. Quality show cat.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.775
- Show cat.
- Oh, my God.

17:07.984 --> 17:10.111
What's wrong with your baby?

17:10.779 --> 17:12.571
That's not a baby. That's a cat.

17:12.740 --> 17:15.532
- Ew, it's creepy looking.
- Oh, no.

17:15.742 --> 17:18.118
No, it's actually very sweet.
It's very sweet. Look.

17:22.249 --> 17:26.252
- Yeah. Do you want it?
- Ha, ha. No, I hate cats.

17:26.462 --> 17:28.253
Well, so then what are you doing to me?
Okay?

17:28.505 --> 17:31.549
Just get out of here, all right? Move on.

17:32.176 --> 17:34.677
- Jeez.
- Wow, what an unusual cat.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.472
Yes, thank you. Exactly. You want it?

17:38.057 --> 17:39.098
Maybe.

17:39.308 --> 17:42.518
I was thinking about getting a cat.
I was just gonna go to the shelter, but...

17:43.062 --> 17:46.272
- Okay. Why not?
- Oh, terrific. That'll be $2,000.

17:47.107 --> 17:49.400
- Ha. What?
- Okay, a thousand.

17:50.110 --> 17:51.778
I thought you wanted me
to adopt your cat?

17:52.029 --> 17:56.824
Well, I do, but you're gonna have to look
at this as more of an investment than a cat.

17:57.034 --> 17:59.118
Okay, yeah. I just wanted a cat.

17:59.286 --> 18:00.870
Okay, okay, okay.

18:02.831 --> 18:04.415
Obviously, you know how to haggle...

18:04.583 --> 18:06.959
...so I'm not gonna try and
take you on, okay?

18:07.169 --> 18:08.878
So $800, and I don't call the cops...

18:09.046 --> 18:11.380
...which I should
because you are robbing me blind.

18:11.590 --> 18:15.009
Blind. Just take the cat,
leave the money and run away.

18:15.219 --> 18:17.470
Just run away. Damn it. Ugh.

18:17.638 --> 18:20.264
Can't you at least smile or something?

18:23.811 --> 18:26.604
Okay, did anybody just hear that?
Anybody?

18:33.570 --> 18:36.656
- I'm starving.
- Come on, guys. Suck it up.

18:36.865 --> 18:38.658
We're closing in on 10 hours.

18:38.867 --> 18:40.868
It's gut-check time.

18:41.078 --> 18:44.455
I don't know who made you the boss.
We invented this game.

18:44.623 --> 18:47.458
Please. I made this game what it is.

18:47.709 --> 18:49.544
Not fun anymore?

18:51.171 --> 18:52.296
I'm still hungry.

18:52.464 --> 18:54.132
All right, there's some pizza at my place.

18:54.299 --> 18:56.217
We can eat with one hand, right?
Are you with me?

18:56.468 --> 18:59.137
- I am.
- All right, let's go. Come on.

18:59.638 --> 19:01.222
Let's go, Team Monica.

19:04.351 --> 19:06.435
All right, we can work out the name later.

19:09.690 --> 19:12.483
Rachel, what is your cat doing
in one of my bowls?

19:12.734 --> 19:14.318
It's not. I'm defrosting a chicken.

19:17.030 --> 19:18.656
Oh, I sold, uh, Mrs. Whiskerson.

19:18.907 --> 19:20.533
Oh, thank God.

19:20.909 --> 19:23.327
- Did you get your money back?
- Yeah, $1500.

19:23.579 --> 19:25.621
Wow, you made a profit?

19:28.917 --> 19:31.586
- I just came for the red velvet pillow.
- Oh, yeah.

19:32.713 --> 19:35.006
- There you go.
- Thanks, Rachel.

19:35.257 --> 19:38.176
And, uh, don't forget,
you can come visit her any time you want.

19:38.427 --> 19:41.053
Oh, good. Great. I'll keep that in mind.

19:43.807 --> 19:48.561
Ahem, hey. So, what is this,
some kind of snake or something?

19:59.698 --> 20:01.282
I really like waking up with you.

20:01.491 --> 20:04.035
I like waking up with you too.

20:04.369 --> 20:07.163
Oh, it's such a beautiful morning.

20:07.414 --> 20:08.873
I could stay here all day.

20:09.166 --> 20:10.917
That would be great.

20:11.168 --> 20:13.669
- We could have breakfast in bed.
- Wait, just a second.

20:15.797 --> 20:17.048
Oh!

20:17.925 --> 20:19.425
Oh, no.

20:22.554 --> 20:26.098
All right. Come on, Monica.
Look alive. Come on, look alive.

20:30.938 --> 20:32.438
Oh, good. You're all up.

20:32.856 --> 20:36.108
Phoebe, it's six o'clock in the morning.
Why aren't you at Gary's?

20:36.318 --> 20:38.069
- Oh, yeah. That's over.
- What?

20:38.237 --> 20:41.239
Come on, Gary's such a great guy.
Whatever the problem, you can work it out.

20:41.448 --> 20:43.366
- He shot a bird.
- Oh, that is over.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.786
- I'm sorry.
- That's terrible.

20:47.037 --> 20:50.122
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'll be all right.

20:50.874 --> 20:54.085
- Oh, hey, here, Pheebs.
- Oh. Nah, I don't feel like playing.

20:59.424 --> 21:02.176
It's okay. It's okay.

21:03.095 --> 21:06.138
Just pretend that it didn't happen, okay?
No one needs to know.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.266
Phoebe's not an official ball player.

21:08.433 --> 21:11.477
I mean, only official ball players
can drop the ball.

21:12.896 --> 21:14.605
- Come on.
- Let's go.

21:15.524 --> 21:17.108
Phoebe, honey,
you wanna get breakfast?

21:17.401 --> 21:19.151
- Yeah.
- Okay. Okay, let's race.

21:19.361 --> 21:22.196
First one there wins. Ha, ha.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.367
- You guys wanna eat here?
- Yeah.

21:32.416 --> 21:33.749
Oh, man, that was great, huh?

21:33.917 --> 21:36.085
Can you believe how long
we threw that ball around?

21:36.336 --> 21:38.462
It is amazing it lasted that long.

21:38.672 --> 21:40.381
I know. My arm is killing me.

21:40.632 --> 21:43.259
No, I meant with the dropper over here.

21:43.468 --> 21:45.511
You know, how did I get
this reputation as a dropper?

21:45.679 --> 21:48.222
I am anything but a dropper.

21:48.432 --> 21:49.932
Ross.
