00:25.984 --> 00:27.944
<i>The universe.</i>

00:28.027 --> 00:32.991
<i>This universe
is 16 billion years old.</i>

00:34.576 --> 00:35.994
<i>In those early days,</i>

00:36.077 --> 00:38.621
<i>the conflict
between stability and change,</i>

00:39.664 --> 00:42.876
<i>between stagnation and anarchy,</i>

00:42.959 --> 00:46.045
<i>sparked beings of pure energy.</i>

00:48.757 --> 00:50.717
<i>Great Lords of Order</i>

00:52.761 --> 00:55.346
<i>and puissant Lords of Chaos.</i>

00:56.681 --> 00:58.141
<i>Entrusted to maintain</i>

00:58.224 --> 01:01.311
<i>the sacred balance
between opposing forces.</i>

01:02.479 --> 01:04.272
<i>As the loss of said balance</i>

01:04.355 --> 01:09.194
<i>once heralded the destruction
of the old universe.</i>

01:11.488 --> 01:13.406
<i>There is
no moral judgment here.</i>

01:16.701 --> 01:19.120
<i>No conflict
between good and evil.</i>

01:22.165 --> 01:25.168
<i>Unless good is
the balance itself</i>

01:25.251 --> 01:30.006
<i>and evil is
that balance's undoing.</i>

02:23.977 --> 02:25.395
Got one!

02:25.478 --> 02:26.896
Khalid!

02:32.652 --> 02:34.529
- Ha! Two points. Mary!

02:35.613 --> 02:36.489
No worries.

02:39.242 --> 02:41.202
Speed of Mercury!

02:46.124 --> 02:47.167
Ha!

02:47.250 --> 02:49.043
- Ow! Quit it.

02:49.127 --> 02:52.088
Oh. Thanks, Leroy.
Three more incoming.

03:02.724 --> 03:04.517
Strength of Hercules!

03:11.608 --> 03:14.027
Mary,
you crushed that magic.

03:14.110 --> 03:15.612
You too, Khaleed.

03:15.695 --> 03:18.364
Um, actually, I prefer
"Khalid."

03:18.448 --> 03:20.116
Like in the back of the throat.

03:20.199 --> 03:21.409
- Khalid?
- Khalid?

03:21.492 --> 03:22.827
Mmm, pretty close.

03:22.911 --> 03:24.954
Speaking of pretty close,

03:25.038 --> 03:28.416
catching six Trogowogs
isn't bad, but...

03:31.377 --> 03:33.379
You're all becoming
great sentinels of magic,

03:33.463 --> 03:37.467
but you need to maintain
a better awareness
of your surroundings.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.302
Aw, man, we flunked.

03:39.385 --> 03:42.347
No, no, more like a...
a B-minus.

03:54.150 --> 03:55.818
There. The Trogs are home.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.696
Now for the glamour spell
that's been hiding us all.

03:59.989 --> 04:01.824
Oh. Sorry.
Didn't see you there.

04:01.908 --> 04:03.785
No harm done.

04:03.868 --> 04:07.330
Traci, you're still
relying too much
on your bad-luck powers.

04:07.413 --> 04:09.332
I want you to focus more
on your urban magic

04:09.415 --> 04:11.125
until it comes to you
as easily.

04:11.209 --> 04:13.920
Khalid, fix what you
bend or break.

04:17.799 --> 04:22.178
It's important to balance
the natural and magical worlds.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.055
Plus, the tree will thank you.

04:24.138 --> 04:25.765
So would that swollen Trogowog.

04:25.848 --> 04:27.809
Ugh. I totally forgot
to fix him.

04:27.892 --> 04:30.520
No worries.
Trogs are pretty elastic.

04:30.603 --> 04:32.105
He'll belch it out soon enough.

04:32.188 --> 04:33.856
Huh, that I'd like to see.

04:33.940 --> 04:37.151
And Mary,
you're still thinking
too much like a superhero,

04:37.235 --> 04:39.862
which is understandable
given your history.

04:39.946 --> 04:43.658
But magic
isn't just about giving
or getting meta abilities.

04:43.741 --> 04:47.370
Use your imagination
when you tap into
the Earth's ley lines,

04:47.453 --> 04:49.539
or other sources
of mystic power.

04:49.622 --> 04:51.082
Spread your wings.

04:52.458 --> 04:54.043
Oh, come on now,

04:54.127 --> 04:56.004
don't let a little
constructive criticism
get you down.

04:56.087 --> 04:58.589
You're all doing great.
In fact...

05:00.633 --> 05:03.928
In fact,
you are my best students.

05:04.012 --> 05:06.764
We're your only students.

05:06.848 --> 05:08.599
And still the best.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.338
What was that?

05:39.422 --> 05:40.506
I don't know.

06:00.276 --> 06:03.321
<i>The situation in Markovia
couldn't be better.</i>

06:03.404 --> 06:06.282
<i>Another clutch of meta-humans
arrives each day.</i>

06:06.365 --> 06:11.287
<i>In addition,
Ultra-Humanite and Dr. Jace
are doing fine work,</i>

06:11.370 --> 06:13.372
<i>using Tar
to activate still more.</i>

06:14.832 --> 06:17.460
<i>Best of all,
they're volunteers.</i>

06:17.543 --> 06:20.129
<i>There's no coercion,
no trafficking.</i>

06:20.213 --> 06:22.048
<i>A little patriotic nudge,</i>

06:22.131 --> 06:25.384
<i>passed from myself
to King Brion to his people,</i>

06:25.468 --> 06:27.470
<i>does the trick quite nicely.</i>

06:27.553 --> 06:33.142
<i>And Helga has really taken
these newly minted metas
under her wing.</i>

06:33.226 --> 06:35.311
<i>She's like a mother
to them all.</i>

06:35.394 --> 06:37.230
<i>-Oh, it's very sweet.</i>

06:37.313 --> 06:39.816
And what of the push
from Secretary General Troia

06:39.899 --> 06:42.110
to send UN inspectors
to Markovia?

06:42.193 --> 06:44.946
<i>A minor concern, but--
- This is bad. Not good.</i>

06:45.029 --> 06:46.489
<i>-I have to go.</i>
- Klarion?

06:46.572 --> 06:48.658
<i>No time to explain.
Teekl, you tell them.</i>

06:51.077 --> 06:55.206
<i>Our excitable friend
seems to be having a moment.</i>

06:59.418 --> 07:01.587
<i>Over 12 millennia ago,</i>

07:01.671 --> 07:05.925
<i>Vandar Adg
established a village
for his spawn...</i>

07:06.008 --> 07:10.012
<i>-...beings that today
would be called...</i>

07:10.096 --> 07:11.889
<i>meta-humans.</i>

07:13.224 --> 07:16.435
<i>This was to be Vandar's utopia,</i>

07:16.519 --> 07:18.604
<i>a place where all his children,</i>

07:18.688 --> 07:20.314
<i>those that descended from him</i>

07:20.398 --> 07:23.234
<i>and those he had taken
under his wing,</i>

07:23.317 --> 07:27.989
<i>could live in peace and harmony
under his rule.</i>

07:29.365 --> 07:31.117
<i>In time,</i>

07:31.200 --> 07:33.953
<i>Vandar left
to conquer more lands.</i>

07:36.831 --> 07:39.083
<i>Returning to his village
in triumph,</i>

07:39.167 --> 07:43.546
<i>he discovered
his utopia had been undone.</i>

07:50.887 --> 07:51.721
Ugh!

07:55.975 --> 07:57.894
Andie, isn't it Gar's turn
to clean out the fridge?

07:57.977 --> 08:02.190
Yeah, but he was so tired,
I offered to do it for him.

08:02.273 --> 08:05.067
The poor guy
really looked like
he could use some sleep.

08:12.825 --> 08:15.912
All right, climb aboard.

08:15.995 --> 08:17.121
- Ow!

08:17.205 --> 08:19.457
Okay, okay.
The dragon it is.

08:19.540 --> 08:22.543
I thought we were
gonna figure out what that
weird energy wave was?

08:22.627 --> 08:24.212
Isn't that what we're doing?

08:25.338 --> 08:26.088
Fine.

08:26.172 --> 08:28.507
Mr. Tawny, I choose you.

08:37.975 --> 08:39.268
So crash!

08:39.352 --> 08:41.354
Class,
here's your next test.

08:41.437 --> 08:42.813
Try to keep up.

08:48.402 --> 08:50.154
You didn't have to go
all Mary Poppins.

08:50.238 --> 08:51.864
You know,
we could've taken the subway.

08:51.948 --> 08:54.617
Where's the fun
in that?

08:54.700 --> 08:57.036
Hey, Mary,
I know I'm the new guy here,

08:57.119 --> 08:58.913
but what did Zatanna mean

08:58.996 --> 09:01.415
when she said that
you're still thinking too much
like a superhero?

09:01.499 --> 09:05.544
Oh, that. See,
I used to be a superhero,
called Sergeant...

09:05.628 --> 09:07.171
Mmm, never mind.

09:07.255 --> 09:09.090
I was on the covert team,
so you wouldn't
have heard of me.

09:09.173 --> 09:12.343
But I had the power,
or a third of the power,
anyway of...

09:12.426 --> 09:14.470
Well...

09:14.553 --> 09:16.514
I can't actually say it myself.

09:16.597 --> 09:18.140
Shazam!

09:18.224 --> 09:21.227
Um,
so, what happened?

09:21.310 --> 09:22.603
I was just a kid.

09:22.687 --> 09:24.438
I wasn't ready
for power back then.

09:24.522 --> 09:25.564
I had to give it up.

09:26.732 --> 09:27.775
I had to.

09:41.539 --> 09:43.040
That was amazing!

09:43.124 --> 09:45.501
You know, except for the part
where we nearly hit a bus.

09:45.584 --> 09:47.503
Why's a school bus out
at this time of night, anyway?

09:47.586 --> 09:50.464
Eh, buses happen.

09:52.758 --> 09:54.343
What are we doing here?

09:54.427 --> 09:57.471
Meeting an old friend.
Someone you all should know.

10:12.278 --> 10:15.865
Nimue Inwudu,
also known as Madame Xanadu,

10:15.948 --> 10:18.868
- allow me to introduce--
- Your students.

10:18.951 --> 10:24.332
Traci Thurston,
Mary Bromfield,
and Khalid Nassour.

10:24.415 --> 10:26.751
<i>Bonsoir, mes amis.</i>

10:26.834 --> 10:29.712
Madame Xanadu
offers you welcome.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.762
<i>Vandar attacked this new foe.</i>

10:39.555 --> 10:41.307
<i>But with a snap
of his fingers...</i>

10:43.517 --> 10:46.395
<i>...Klarion the Witch Boy
killed him...</i>

10:48.105 --> 10:51.942
<i>only to see Vandar rise again.</i>

10:52.026 --> 10:55.446
<i>Vandar soon realized
he wasn't facing a mortal,</i>

10:55.529 --> 10:57.907
<i>not even a meta-human mortal.</i>

10:57.990 --> 11:01.285
<i>This Klarion was something new.</i>

11:01.369 --> 11:03.788
<i>Or despite appearances,</i>

11:03.871 --> 11:05.790
<i>something incredibly old.</i>

11:05.873 --> 11:08.459
<i>Something elemental,</i>

11:08.542 --> 11:10.044
<i>fundamental...</i>

11:11.170 --> 11:12.880
<i>to the universe.</i>

11:50.418 --> 11:53.838
Hello. I wish
to express my appreciation.

11:53.921 --> 11:57.383
Thank you for being my anchor
on the mortal plane.

11:57.466 --> 12:02.304
In return, I will provide you
with an appropriate name.

12:02.388 --> 12:06.475
Let's call you Flaw, shall we?

12:06.559 --> 12:09.478
Now, Flaw,
if you would kneel.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.276
There.

12:15.359 --> 12:18.154
You look absolutely darling.

12:18.237 --> 12:20.406
Child, what you doing in here?

12:21.282 --> 12:22.908
And what is that?

12:22.992 --> 12:23.993
"Child"?

12:24.827 --> 12:27.621
Hmm. I like it.

12:27.705 --> 12:29.081
Thank you, sir.

12:29.165 --> 12:32.168
You have served
a valuable purpose.

12:32.251 --> 12:36.714
Flaw, please reward
this mortal accordingly.

12:38.257 --> 12:39.383
Hey! Hey! Stop there.

12:39.467 --> 12:41.218
Stop right there.
Don't make me shoot!

12:47.600 --> 12:51.604
This new form
looks adorable.

12:52.563 --> 12:53.856
Still,

12:53.939 --> 12:57.443
I wonder what these things
look like on the inside.

13:06.785 --> 13:09.580
Uh, Gar, you got a minute?

13:09.663 --> 13:11.373
Sure, BD. What's up?

13:13.250 --> 13:15.044
I figured I should check in
with you.

13:15.127 --> 13:17.922
As part of my official
den mother gig, like.

13:18.005 --> 13:20.466
Cool, cool. I'm crash.

13:20.549 --> 13:24.470
Grand. Eh, except,
you haven't been
going on missions,

13:24.553 --> 13:26.555
which is fine. Eh...

13:26.639 --> 13:29.099
But, uh, now you're not
doing your chores either.

13:29.183 --> 13:31.101
It's not like you, Gar.

13:32.019 --> 13:33.020
Should I be worried?

13:33.103 --> 13:34.897
Nah, man. I'm just tired's all.

13:34.980 --> 13:37.399
But sorry.
I'll get on the chores thing.

13:37.483 --> 13:38.400
Got you covered.

13:40.319 --> 13:41.904
So, was that it?

13:42.738 --> 13:45.366
I, uh, reckon so.

13:53.457 --> 13:55.459
Hey,
where's that music coming from?

13:56.001 --> 13:57.253
Hmm? Oh.

13:57.336 --> 13:59.088
From Preservation Hall,
across the street.

13:59.171 --> 14:02.967
But, Preservation Hall,
isn't that in New Orleans?

14:03.050 --> 14:04.385
Of course.

14:06.637 --> 14:07.680
Whoa.

14:11.392 --> 14:13.102
We entered through
the Harlem door.

14:13.185 --> 14:15.604
Madame Xanadu's parlor
is actually in New Orleans,

14:15.688 --> 14:18.274
but it has doors
the world over,

14:18.357 --> 14:19.900
all leading here.

14:19.984 --> 14:22.987
This "parlor"
looks more like a tourist trap.

14:23.070 --> 14:25.698
It was, once.

14:26.323 --> 14:27.408
But now...

14:32.871 --> 14:34.623
You okay?

14:34.707 --> 14:36.875
Madame Xanadu
is a seeker of secrets
and a keeper of knowledge.

14:36.959 --> 14:39.670
For years, her natural gifts
lay dormant and forgotten.

14:39.753 --> 14:41.297
She was a charlatan, a poser,

14:41.380 --> 14:43.632
until an encounter with
Kent Nelson and Abra Kadabra

14:43.716 --> 14:46.260
inspired her to become what
she had long claimed to be.

14:46.343 --> 14:48.679
The greatest seer
and medium on Earth.

14:48.762 --> 14:50.055
Whoa.

14:50.848 --> 14:52.141
Kent Nelson?

14:52.224 --> 14:53.892
I assume you know
why we're here.

14:53.976 --> 14:58.230
Powerful mystic pulse
felt all around the world, yes?

14:58.314 --> 15:00.024
I've lost track of it,

15:00.107 --> 15:03.819
but I can send you
to the last known location
of its locus.

15:03.902 --> 15:04.903
Perfect.

15:05.863 --> 15:07.031
Hmm.

15:13.203 --> 15:14.997
That should get you there.

15:16.165 --> 15:18.792
- Whoops. Sorry.

15:22.755 --> 15:23.839
Really?

15:23.922 --> 15:26.508
Favors don't keep
the lights on.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.093
Thank you, Nimue.

15:28.177 --> 15:31.180
Of course.
Now, please, be careful, Z.

15:31.263 --> 15:34.683
I haven't felt a chaotic energy
like that in this lifetime.

15:57.873 --> 16:03.212
<i>For 300 days
and 300 nights,</i>

16:03.295 --> 16:08.759
<i>Klarion killed Vandar
in 300 different ways.</i>

16:09.802 --> 16:11.679
<i>And every time,</i>

16:11.762 --> 16:14.139
<i>Vandar rose again.</i>

16:14.223 --> 16:19.186
<i>Until, finally,
the Witch Boy grew
intrigued enough to stop.</i>

16:19.269 --> 16:21.522
<i>Each was a revelation
to the other.</i>

16:21.605 --> 16:26.652
<i>Klarion learned that mortals
had the potential to interest
and engage him.</i>

16:26.735 --> 16:30.072
<i>And Vandar learned of
the Lords of Chaos and Order</i>

16:30.155 --> 16:31.907
<i>that helped govern the cosmos.</i>

16:31.990 --> 16:35.786
<i>Vandar did not yet know
what use he could make
of this entity.</i>

16:35.869 --> 16:39.164
<i>But seeing
a valuable potential asset</i>

16:39.248 --> 16:42.543
<i>and not being one to let
an opportunity slip away,</i>

16:42.626 --> 16:46.296
<i>Vandar was certain
he would think of something.</i>

16:46.380 --> 16:53.929
<i>Still, the priority
was to stop Klarion
from murdering his people.</i>

16:54.012 --> 16:58.976
<i>Unfortunately,
the Witch Boy balked
at any restriction, asking,</i>

16:59.059 --> 17:01.019
<i>"Why would I listen to you?"</i>

17:01.103 --> 17:04.982
<i>"Give me 1,000 years,
and I'll show you why.</i>

17:05.065 --> 17:10.279
<i>Meet me right back here
in this village
called Atlantis."</i>

17:10.362 --> 17:14.491
<i>"All right.
I'll play, for now."</i>

17:20.330 --> 17:22.082
Holy moly!

17:22.166 --> 17:25.461
Who would do this? And why?

17:25.544 --> 17:27.463
Some kind of ritual killings?

17:27.546 --> 17:28.839
I don't think so.

17:28.922 --> 17:31.175
It reminds me
of first-year medical school.

17:31.258 --> 17:32.968
An anatomy lesson.

17:33.051 --> 17:34.511
I think you're right, Khalid.

17:34.595 --> 17:36.847
Something inhuman did this.

17:36.930 --> 17:39.183
Something that wanted
to know how we tick.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.187
What did you do?

17:45.147 --> 17:47.066
Yes, I know we
shouldn't have stopped
to torture those hummingbirds,

17:47.149 --> 17:49.735
but it seemed like a fun idea
at the time.

17:53.363 --> 17:56.366
Oh, no.
I'm not falling for that again.

17:56.450 --> 18:00.037
Took me 16 days to get out
of that tower last time.

18:00.120 --> 18:01.497
I won't get stuck,

18:01.580 --> 18:04.166
and I won't stand still
for what you got planned.

18:05.626 --> 18:08.170
- What do we do?
- Pool your energies into me.

18:08.253 --> 18:09.421
Power of Zeus!

18:19.223 --> 18:21.600
No more ankhs.
No more meddling.

18:21.683 --> 18:23.435
You all die today!

18:40.828 --> 18:43.205
Hey! What do you think
you're doing?

18:43.288 --> 18:44.998
Giving as good as I get!

18:45.082 --> 18:47.626
- Strength of Hercules!

18:52.422 --> 18:55.092
You would strike a little boy?

18:55.175 --> 18:57.678
With his own evil power?
Damn straight.

18:57.761 --> 18:59.471
You want my power?

18:59.555 --> 19:02.224
You can't handle my power!

19:07.896 --> 19:10.566
Ah! Tangles.

19:10.649 --> 19:13.902
- Tingles. Tingles.
They knew I meant Tingles.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.821
Khalid, the cat is his anchor!

19:19.867 --> 19:23.412
Your type
always goes for the cat!

19:40.929 --> 19:42.264
This will do.

19:44.766 --> 19:47.269
I can taste him here.

19:47.352 --> 19:48.979
Tastes like...

19:49.688 --> 19:51.231
disappointment.

20:18.634 --> 20:20.969
If you would oblige me, please.

20:29.478 --> 20:33.899
Aw, not her!
Of all the ones to send.

20:35.067 --> 20:38.111
No, no, no, not now!

20:41.740 --> 20:45.202
Dang it. I wanted to
finish off these kids.

20:45.285 --> 20:47.663
Sorry to split, losers,

20:47.746 --> 20:50.666
but I got other figs to fry.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.794
They knew what I meant!

21:00.968 --> 21:04.930
<i>Thus, the threat of
the Chaos Lord was delayed.</i>

21:07.516 --> 21:09.017
<i>But not dismissed.</i>

21:11.186 --> 21:12.646
Yet, in that moment,

21:12.729 --> 21:16.692
a bond was forged
between an immortal mortal

21:16.775 --> 21:21.697
and one of the cosmos's
elemental entities.

21:21.780 --> 21:23.490
Come now, Stranger,

21:23.573 --> 21:26.660
why do you tell me
what I already know?

21:26.743 --> 21:28.829
To remind you

21:28.912 --> 21:31.707
of what must not be forgotten.

21:31.790 --> 21:34.626
Damn you
and your enigmatic musings.

21:34.710 --> 21:40.507
For once,
say what you came here
to... say.

21:46.304 --> 21:48.765
[laser blasts
and dramatic music playing
in video on cell phone]

21:58.483 --> 21:59.776
<i>Lieutenant Der'Chow,</i>

21:59.860 --> 22:02.070
<i>reroute power
to the command console,</i>

22:02.154 --> 22:04.406
<i>and use the last
of our beryllium crystals
to boost our tazer-beams.</i>

22:04.489 --> 22:06.575
<i>We may be a billion lightyears
from home</i>

22:06.658 --> 22:08.618
<i>and stuck in the middle
of a Klamulon Civil War,</i>

22:08.702 --> 22:11.621
<i>but the crew of the</i> Engager
<i>does not know how to quit!</i>

22:11.705 --> 22:13.290
<i>We'll get Captain Bender back</i>

22:13.373 --> 22:15.792
<i>and take down that
zombie-cyborg-Ensign-Valiant.</i>

22:15.876 --> 22:17.753
<i>'Cause, face it,</i>

22:17.836 --> 22:20.255
<i>I didn't journey
all the way from Mars
only to cut and run.</i>

22:20.338 --> 22:24.342
<i>And I bet you didn't trade
an easy life on Klamulon-Prime
just to bail, either.</i>

22:24.426 --> 22:26.136
<i>Doesn't matter
how many friends we've lost</i>

22:26.219 --> 22:27.971
<i>or how many ships
they throw at us,</i>

22:28.055 --> 22:29.347
<i>we don't give up on the mission</i>

22:29.431 --> 22:31.058
<i>and we don't give up
on each other!</i>

22:31.141 --> 22:32.934
<i>Now, fire tazer-one!</i>
