WEBVTT

05:16.818 --> 05:18.653
Taylor!
Tangina.

05:18.736 --> 05:20.071
Over here!

05:23.074 --> 05:25.827
I think we finally
found the core.

05:26.327 --> 05:28.579
We dug under the swimming pool.

05:29.330 --> 05:32.375
This is directly below
the old graveyard.

05:32.917 --> 05:34.836
There's a presence.

06:17.336 --> 06:19.755
There's
something terrible.

06:19.839 --> 06:21.382
Too much power.

07:38.209 --> 07:41.128
I've seen it in dreams.

07:41.796 --> 07:43.172
What is it?

07:45.758 --> 07:47.677
Where's the family now?

07:53.224 --> 07:54.266
Did you make that?

07:54.350 --> 07:55.851
It's like
an inch and a half.

07:55.935 --> 07:56.978
Let me try this up
against her arm.

07:57.061 --> 07:59.021
Oh, Mother, it's too
hot on the kids.

07:59.105 --> 08:00.815
- Oh, Dad.
- Okay. Ready.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.445
You'll be lucky if your
teeth don't fall out from that.

08:08.197 --> 08:10.366
Did you think up that
sandwich all by yourself?

08:10.449 --> 08:11.867
No. Gramma helped.

08:11.951 --> 08:15.287
What a fib! Grab me the red yarn
out of my basket, will you, honey?

08:17.081 --> 08:18.374
E. Buzz, stop!

08:18.457 --> 08:19.792
That's disgusting.

08:19.875 --> 08:21.669
- Oh, Rob!
- E. Buzz.

08:21.794 --> 08:23.087
E. Buzz, down!

08:23.129 --> 08:25.506
Well, maybe E.
Buzz would like some mustard.

08:25.589 --> 08:28.217
E. Buzz,
get down. Down, E. Buzz.

08:28.926 --> 08:30.636
I'll say "down," and then
he'll get down. Down!

08:32.763 --> 08:33.764
He really listens to you.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.767
Honey, now could you
get me the yellow yarn?

08:37.476 --> 08:40.270
Oh, Rob, very nice
to share with E. Buzz.

08:40.354 --> 08:42.231
E. Buzz knows
how to share with Robbie.

08:42.313 --> 08:44.358
E. Buzz,
get down.

08:46.110 --> 08:47.570
Thank you, angel.

08:47.653 --> 08:49.363
Come on, Guerrero!
Hit it out of the park!

08:49.447 --> 08:50.573
Yeah, hit it!

08:50.656 --> 08:52.283
<i>Guerrero has fired
a right and struck out...</i>

08:54.452 --> 08:56.912
Dad, can't we get a TV
like everybody else?

08:56.996 --> 08:59.123
No, no, we can't get a TV.

08:59.540 --> 09:02.334
Great, I'll just have
to grow up retarded.

09:02.418 --> 09:05.296
Come on, Rob, kids
don't grow up retardo

09:05.379 --> 09:06.464
because of lack of television.

09:06.547 --> 09:07.715
<i>Guerrero drives one
to left center field...</i>

09:07.798 --> 09:10.885
Atta boy, Guerrero! Did
you see that, Robbie?

09:10.968 --> 09:13.220
No, Dad.
I didn't see it.

09:13.971 --> 09:16.474
Well, you gotta use
your imagination, son.

09:17.183 --> 09:19.602
Come on. We're gonna
test this baby out.

09:20.144 --> 09:21.187
God!

09:28.194 --> 09:31.614
How am I gonna sell this to
innocent housewives, Robbie?

09:31.697 --> 09:33.157
I don't know, Dad.

09:55.346 --> 09:57.223
Whatcha drawing, honey?

09:57.598 --> 09:59.517
Don't know. Stuff.

10:00.434 --> 10:02.186
You draw very well.

10:03.395 --> 10:05.898
Do you want to be an
artist when you grow up?

10:05.981 --> 10:08.692
Maybe. Don't want
to grow up much.

10:12.029 --> 10:13.280
How come?

10:13.364 --> 10:15.116
Probably not much fun.

10:15.199 --> 10:16.742
Oh, sure it is.

10:17.535 --> 10:19.787
I've loved every age I've been.

10:20.371 --> 10:22.540
They all have their blessings.

10:22.915 --> 10:24.708
When I was your age,

10:25.543 --> 10:29.171
I learned that I could do things
that other folks couldn't.

10:29.713 --> 10:31.715
Like what kind of things?

10:33.217 --> 10:35.719
I just knew things.

10:36.554 --> 10:39.265
I didn't know how
I knew, but I did.

10:40.099 --> 10:41.433
Like what?

10:44.019 --> 10:48.983
Once, my mother lost her bracelet
and I knew where it was.

10:50.151 --> 10:53.696
Two miles from our house in a
place that I'd never been.

10:54.446 --> 10:55.531
Now,

10:56.824 --> 11:00.870
do you ever know things
and can't explain why?

11:07.585 --> 11:08.627
Yes?

11:09.253 --> 11:10.337
Yes.

11:12.173 --> 11:13.674
Well, darling,

11:14.550 --> 11:18.137
that's a very special gift
that you and I have.

11:19.388 --> 11:21.473
It's nothing to be scared of.

11:21.557 --> 11:23.767
Will it help me be a ballerina?

11:23.851 --> 11:25.519
Yes, sure it will.

11:26.103 --> 11:28.355
Whatever you dream, you can be.

11:32.067 --> 11:33.569
They denied
our claim again!

11:33.652 --> 11:34.695
What?

11:34.778 --> 11:38.032
I told you, we never should have told them
that the house vanished into thin air.

11:38.115 --> 11:39.783
That's exactly what
I've been talking about.

11:39.867 --> 11:42.453
You tell the truth, and
what do you get? Nada!

11:42.536 --> 11:43.954
They say that if
the house disappeared,

11:44.038 --> 11:45.748
then technically,
it's only missing.

11:45.831 --> 11:47.082
Missing?

11:47.333 --> 11:50.127
What do they think, this house
is going to return or something?

11:50.211 --> 11:52.421
Now, it's been a full year.
The house is not coming back.

11:52.504 --> 11:55.466
I got a gut feeling, Diane,
I'm positive about that.

11:55.549 --> 11:57.301
I know that, Steven.

11:58.010 --> 11:59.553
You tell them that...

11:59.637 --> 12:02.556
No, no, I'm gonna fill
out the fourth claim.

12:02.765 --> 12:04.516
Okay, what are we going
to claim this time?

12:04.600 --> 12:06.602
Act of God? Housenapping?

12:07.311 --> 12:10.189
Steven, we are almost broke.

12:10.272 --> 12:13.067
Okay, we're broke,
but we're not starving.

12:13.317 --> 12:16.987
Okay, but I don't happen to like
having to live off my mother.

12:17.071 --> 12:20.157
And I think that we deserve a
house of our own again someday.

12:20.241 --> 12:22.034
Oh, honey, gee, gosh.

12:22.368 --> 12:24.203
See, that's the difference
between you and me, Diane,

12:24.286 --> 12:25.913
I am into downward mobility.

12:25.996 --> 12:28.499
I'm not settled for it,
I'm into it.

12:28.999 --> 12:30.918
I like getting out there in the
streets and meeting those...

12:31.001 --> 12:32.336
I like selling vacuums.

12:32.419 --> 12:36.548
I like carrying the pipes and the
apparatus in my little demo case.

12:36.632 --> 12:39.843
Let's get the kids up, and we'll
paint the car different colors,

12:39.927 --> 12:40.928
kind of DayGlo,

12:41.011 --> 12:43.264
like we used to do when we
were kinda freaky, you know?

12:43.347 --> 12:45.849
The freaky Freelings
on the road again!

12:45.933 --> 12:48.686
You know, the family
whose house disappeared!

12:48.769 --> 12:50.813
Watch them find it, Diane.

12:50.896 --> 12:52.273
I'm not going to
get upset about this,

12:52.356 --> 12:53.816
but I'll tell you something,
I'm writing them back

12:53.899 --> 12:57.194
and when I sign that letter
I'm signing "Mr. President."

12:57.278 --> 12:59.530
You are wacko!

13:01.365 --> 13:02.574
Steven.

13:04.535 --> 13:05.536
Hmm.

13:05.869 --> 13:07.246
Steven.
Hmm?

13:08.831 --> 13:11.125
Steven, you were never a hippie.

13:13.377 --> 13:14.461
Huh?

13:14.545 --> 13:17.589
You were never a hippie. You
were always into making money.

13:17.673 --> 13:20.718
The only reason you painted your van
DayGlo colors and grew your hair long

13:20.801 --> 13:23.053
was to impress Cookie Gurnich.

13:23.554 --> 13:26.390
Cookie? Necki necka wow!

13:26.807 --> 13:30.436
Steven, don't tell me what Cookie can do.
I hated you then.

13:31.437 --> 13:33.647
But I always knew how to make up to you?
Didn't I?

13:33.731 --> 13:34.982
No, I don't remember.

13:35.065 --> 13:36.483
Sure you do.
I do not!

13:36.567 --> 13:37.609
Oh, come on.

13:37.693 --> 13:40.404
I don't. Oh, you'd
sing that stupid song.

13:40.738 --> 13:41.780
<i>If I fell in love with you</i>

13:41.864 --> 13:44.950
It's not gonna work, Steven.
Not in the shadow of Cookie.

13:45.075 --> 13:46.118
<i>Would you promise to be true?</i>

13:46.201 --> 13:48.162
Steven, don't even try it.

13:48.245 --> 13:49.663
It's not working.

13:49.747 --> 13:51.165
Don't sing that song.

13:51.248 --> 13:53.375
I've never forgiven you
for Cookie Gurnich.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.169
<i>That I've been in love
before I haven't.</i>

13:55.252 --> 13:56.253
Nick.

13:56.837 --> 13:58.005
<i>And I found out love is more</i>

13:58.088 --> 13:59.548
It's... Steven.

13:59.631 --> 14:03.594
<i>Than just holding hands</i>

14:05.387 --> 14:08.599
<i>If I give my love</i>

14:08.682 --> 14:10.726
Did Cookie really crumble?

14:11.101 --> 14:12.436
<i>To you</i>

14:13.395 --> 14:14.938
<i>I must be sure</i>

14:15.022 --> 14:19.485
<i>No!
From the very start</i>

14:19.568 --> 14:21.153
<i>That you</i>

14:22.112 --> 14:25.366
<i>Will love
me more than her</i>

14:26.617 --> 14:30.120
<i>'Cause I couldn't stand the pain</i>

14:31.330 --> 14:33.040
<i>And I</i>

14:33.123 --> 14:37.169
<i>Would be sad if our new love...</i>

14:37.628 --> 14:39.630
Am I interrupting again?

14:40.047 --> 14:41.090
Hi.

14:41.799 --> 14:43.092
Hi, pumpkin.

14:43.175 --> 14:45.511
Mom, I'm going
to be a ballerina.

14:46.428 --> 14:47.388
Great.

14:47.471 --> 14:49.223
Not tonight, honey.

14:50.432 --> 14:52.226
Bedtime. Say,
"Good night, Mom."

14:52.309 --> 14:53.352
Good night, honey.

14:53.435 --> 14:55.062
Let's sleep in our own
bed tonight, shall we?

14:55.145 --> 14:56.105
Okay.

14:56.188 --> 14:57.898
<i>We're dancing down to my bed</i>

14:57.981 --> 14:59.566
<i>We're dancing down the hall</i>

14:59.650 --> 15:03.028
<i>We're dancing
the tour jet√© most of all</i>

15:06.532 --> 15:08.534
Come on, Dodgers!

15:11.912 --> 15:13.580
Come on, let's go.

15:13.956 --> 15:15.165
Let's go.
Come on, come on.

15:15.249 --> 15:16.375
Robbie?

15:16.458 --> 15:18.585
Mom, I've talked to the kittens.

15:18.669 --> 15:20.087
They want to come home with us.

15:20.170 --> 15:22.172
Uh, no, sweetheart.
E. Buzz would get upset.

15:22.256 --> 15:24.007
Robbie, come on.
Why?

15:24.091 --> 15:26.093
Well, he's not used to
having other pets around.

15:26.176 --> 15:27.428
Robert!

15:27.511 --> 15:29.888
How would you like it if
I brought home a new baby?

15:29.972 --> 15:32.266
That's even better
than a kitten.

15:32.349 --> 15:34.268
Mom, I have a great idea.

15:34.351 --> 15:36.937
No, we are not buying
a television set, Robert.

15:37.020 --> 15:39.398
Mom, a present
for Dad. It's a bargain.

15:48.991 --> 15:50.033
Mom!

15:51.034 --> 15:52.077
Mom!

15:55.998 --> 15:58.459
Mom, where are you? Mom!

16:05.549 --> 16:07.050
Mom! Mom!

16:07.259 --> 16:08.469
Robbie!

16:10.304 --> 16:11.388
Mom!

16:16.560 --> 16:17.728
Robbie!

16:20.105 --> 16:21.148
Hi.

16:22.232 --> 16:23.275
Hi.

16:23.692 --> 16:25.694
Are you lost, sweetheart?

16:27.154 --> 16:29.031
Are you afraid, honey?

16:30.407 --> 16:32.826
Well, why don't
you come with me?

16:32.910 --> 16:33.911
No.

16:35.078 --> 16:36.413
All right.

16:37.039 --> 16:41.418
I'll sing you a song
till your mommy comes back.

16:42.461 --> 16:47.925
<i>God is in his holy temple</i>

16:48.759 --> 16:53.180
<i>Earthly thoughts be silent now</i>

16:53.764 --> 16:54.890
I'd like
to purchase this.

16:54.973 --> 16:57.726
Okay,
that's $10.26 plus tax.

16:58.894 --> 17:00.687
Where's Carol Anne?

17:00.771 --> 17:03.065
I don't know.
She was just here.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.359
Carol Anne?

17:07.236 --> 17:08.319
Baby!

17:10.739 --> 17:13.200
<i>He is with us...</i>

17:13.282 --> 17:16.244
Carol Anne. Honey, what happened?
Did you get lost'?

17:16.328 --> 17:17.788
I don't know.

17:18.622 --> 17:19.623
Thank you.

17:19.705 --> 17:21.124
My pleasure.

17:21.415 --> 17:24.169
Such a lovely child.

17:24.252 --> 17:26.128
Oh, thank you so much.

17:28.715 --> 17:31.385
I'm sorry, honey.
We just stopped into a shop.

17:31.468 --> 17:34.096
I thought you were
right there with us.

17:40.477 --> 17:42.187
Honey, what is it?

17:42.271 --> 17:45.315
Mom, I want to go home.

17:46.024 --> 17:48.777
- They're very unusual.
- They're just drawings.

17:50.279 --> 17:51.488
Ugly.
Aw.

17:52.614 --> 17:54.575
You know that she can see
colors with her hands.

17:54.658 --> 17:57.578
Mama, we don't want
to hear that stuff, okay?

17:57.953 --> 18:00.414
And we don't want Carol
Anne to hear, most of all.

18:00.497 --> 18:02.833
There's nothing to be afraid of.

18:03.041 --> 18:06.295
How do you know what we should be
afraid of? You weren't there, were you?

18:06.378 --> 18:08.630
Why don't you tell me?
It might help.

18:08.714 --> 18:09.756
I did tell you.

18:09.840 --> 18:10.799
No, not everything.

18:10.882 --> 18:12.801
I don't remember everything.

18:31.194 --> 18:34.197
Well, first the canary died.

18:37.743 --> 18:40.537
And then the chairs
went all funny.

18:41.330 --> 18:44.416
And I thought it was kind
of exciting, you know?

18:44.916 --> 18:46.293
And then...

18:47.753 --> 18:49.546
Carol Anne was gone.

18:52.549 --> 18:53.759
And I...

19:07.189 --> 19:08.857
Honey, what is it?

19:09.983 --> 19:11.234
Nothing.

19:15.739 --> 19:19.284
Nothing. I just want to get
on with our lives. It's over.

19:19.618 --> 19:20.786
Diane.

19:21.620 --> 19:25.248
Diane, you've got to go
unafraid into this life.

19:25.540 --> 19:27.918
You don't want to instill
fear into that child

19:28.001 --> 19:30.253
who is truly gifted and
filled with knowledge.

19:30.337 --> 19:32.047
I don't want her to be gifted!

19:32.130 --> 19:33.882
You don't mean that.

19:33.965 --> 19:36.385
I'm going to bed,
Mama. Good night.

19:40.847 --> 19:43.058
I'll be there if you need me.

21:21.448 --> 21:22.532
Yes?

21:23.992 --> 21:25.035
Yes.

21:26.161 --> 21:27.621
I'll be good.

21:29.706 --> 21:31.333
I love you, too.

21:33.084 --> 21:34.878
Good night, Gramma.

21:44.346 --> 21:45.972
She knew you loved her so much.

21:46.056 --> 21:48.683
Oh, if I just had one more day.

21:59.069 --> 22:00.570
What's wrong?

22:04.908 --> 22:06.117
Honey...

22:10.080 --> 22:12.332
Gramma passed away last night.

22:12.749 --> 22:14.251
Gramma died?

22:18.713 --> 22:20.298
Come here, baby.

22:28.807 --> 22:30.600
It's all right, Mom.

22:45.907 --> 22:48.159
<i>Let's plant
them over there, okay?</i>

22:48.743 --> 22:51.204
<i>All right, now, what do you think?
Do you want it here?</i>

22:51.288 --> 22:52.289
<i>No.</i>

22:53.582 --> 22:55.208
How about here?

22:55.292 --> 22:56.418
No.
Where?

22:56.501 --> 22:58.128
I want it there, right there.

22:58.211 --> 22:59.629
Right there?

22:59.921 --> 23:01.965
Right there.
Absolutely here.

23:02.048 --> 23:03.425
Okay.

23:03.967 --> 23:06.845
You dig a hole.
Dig it very deep.

23:17.898 --> 23:19.149
Oh, Mom.

23:21.192 --> 23:23.486
You always made me feel so safe.

23:32.871 --> 23:34.623
I love you so much.

23:42.505 --> 23:43.590
Mom?

23:47.719 --> 23:51.431
Can you put these on me, so I
can be a ballerina with wings?

23:54.059 --> 23:56.978
Darling, you can be
anything you want to be.

24:07.530 --> 24:08.823
Diane.

24:08.907 --> 24:10.951
Mama?
Diane.

24:15.705 --> 24:16.665
Help me!

24:16.748 --> 24:17.791
Oh!

24:21.378 --> 24:22.754
Help me!

24:27.801 --> 24:28.802
Help me!

26:15.325 --> 26:16.743
Hi. Gramma?

26:18.787 --> 26:20.663
Do you have wings now?

26:23.083 --> 26:25.126
My ballerina costume does.

26:27.378 --> 26:28.588
Grammy?

26:30.340 --> 26:31.758
Who are you?

26:33.468 --> 26:35.887
No. Uh-uh.
I don't remember.

26:39.307 --> 26:40.391
What?

26:42.894 --> 26:44.354
<i>Hello, little one.</i>

26:44.479 --> 26:46.523
<i>I am your friend.</i>

26:49.025 --> 26:50.693
<i>We want the angel.</i>

27:03.456 --> 27:05.583
Carol Anne, what's going on?

27:09.129 --> 27:11.756
Carol Anne, what are
you doing? Carol Anne!

27:12.507 --> 27:14.634
Come on!
What are you doing?

27:17.554 --> 27:18.721
Diane.

27:19.180 --> 27:20.723
Oh, Jesus!
The kids.

27:21.891 --> 27:23.560
The kids!
Kids!

27:24.185 --> 27:25.812
Dad, Mom!

27:26.604 --> 27:28.731
We're coming!
Robbie!

27:31.359 --> 27:32.360
Robbie!

27:32.443 --> 27:33.820
Carol Anne!

27:37.532 --> 27:38.867
Robbie!

27:38.950 --> 27:39.993
Carol Anne!

27:40.076 --> 27:41.327
Where are you?
Robbie!

27:41.411 --> 27:42.996
Where are you?

27:43.079 --> 27:44.205
Carol Anne!

28:07.437 --> 28:08.897
They're back.

28:25.955 --> 28:27.957
Don't panic!
Don't panic!

28:28.791 --> 28:30.251
Go, go, go, 90!

28:33.796 --> 28:34.881
Jeez!

28:39.469 --> 28:41.054
Who the hell are you?

28:41.137 --> 28:42.555
Name's Taylor.

28:42.639 --> 28:45.141
Great. Good name.
Come on, let's go.

28:51.189 --> 28:53.149
Tangina Barrons sent me.

28:53.775 --> 28:56.402
Oh, yeah. Well, say hello to the
magic munchkin for us, will you?

28:56.486 --> 28:58.363
Steve, wait, wait.
Sent you for what?

28:58.446 --> 29:00.323
There's no use running.

29:00.615 --> 29:02.158
It'll find you.

29:02.992 --> 29:04.911
You're better off here.

29:05.995 --> 29:08.414
Let's go.
You stay. We're gone.

29:09.165 --> 29:10.667
Come on, kids.

29:34.065 --> 29:37.485
You got me up at 4:00 in
the morning to tell me this?

29:38.444 --> 29:40.530
You are a pack of trouble, girl.

29:40.613 --> 29:42.949
Why are you messing
around with that bum?

29:43.032 --> 29:45.076
Because
I like him.

29:45.952 --> 29:48.079
Dad, are we going to
have to move again?

29:50.915 --> 29:52.709
I don't know, Robbie.

29:53.751 --> 29:55.128
I'm gonna think about it.

29:55.211 --> 29:56.921
Where can we go?

29:57.005 --> 29:58.298
Disneyland?

29:58.381 --> 29:59.882
Oh, puke!
Don't be such an infant!

30:01.217 --> 30:03.803
Okay, what about Dunkin' Donuts?

30:04.387 --> 30:06.014
Shut up, jerko.
Hey!

30:06.097 --> 30:07.473
Look. Here.

30:08.850 --> 30:10.518
Take this, go play
the pinball machine.

30:10.601 --> 30:11.769
And give some to your brother.

30:11.853 --> 30:13.146
- No.
- Come on,

30:13.229 --> 30:16.065
I wanna play pinball.
Give the money to me.

30:18.401 --> 30:20.153
What are we gonna do?
I don't know.

30:20.236 --> 30:21.446
I'm thinking.

30:21.529 --> 30:25.450
Honey, we have to go somewhere.
We can't just drive around.

30:26.034 --> 30:29.579
Well, Mother, just don't you
bring him over to my house.

30:29.662 --> 30:31.247
Waitress, check!

30:40.089 --> 30:44.093
Listen,
children, you can't run from this thing.

30:44.177 --> 30:46.888
It has made contact
and will stop at nothing.

30:46.971 --> 30:49.349
You've got to fight it head on.

30:49.432 --> 30:50.933
Stay together.

30:51.559 --> 30:52.727
Be loving.

30:53.311 --> 30:54.604
Be brave.

30:56.272 --> 30:57.398
Mama?

31:02.904 --> 31:03.988
Mama?

31:05.698 --> 31:07.158
I'm not your mother, lady.

31:07.241 --> 31:08.659
Elizabeth, are you okay?

31:08.743 --> 31:10.244
What happened?

31:10.787 --> 31:13.289
- What happened?
- You went funny.

31:16.793 --> 31:19.045
But it sounded like her.
I don't understand.

31:19.128 --> 31:21.255
Honey, you can't
explain stuff like that.

31:21.339 --> 31:24.425
It just happens. I mean,
there's no reason for it.

31:24.509 --> 31:25.510
What are
you talking about?

31:25.593 --> 31:27.887
It doesn't
matter, honey.

31:29.639 --> 31:30.890
What do
you want?

31:30.973 --> 31:32.475
She told you the truth.

31:32.558 --> 31:33.935
Who?

31:35.269 --> 31:37.105
You mean that...

31:37.188 --> 31:39.607
Ah, man, are you in cahoots
with the lady in there?

31:40.733 --> 31:42.527
I cahoot with no one.

31:42.902 --> 31:44.904
Then why are you following us?

31:44.987 --> 31:46.531
I came to help.

31:47.657 --> 31:49.534
Oh, God. I mean,
you don't understand.

31:49.617 --> 31:51.327
See, we don't want your help.

31:51.411 --> 31:52.954
We don't want anybody's help.

31:53.037 --> 31:54.997
We want to be left alone!

31:55.081 --> 31:57.667
Steven, wait.
Why did Tangina send you?

31:57.750 --> 31:59.419
Why didn't she come herself?

32:00.878 --> 32:02.380
It's my kind of job.

32:02.797 --> 32:03.965
You know, maybe
it's no coincidence.

32:04.048 --> 32:07.260
This guy shows up,
things go kinda screwy.

32:07.677 --> 32:09.178
Get off my car!

32:14.392 --> 32:16.269
Get in the car, Diane.

32:17.186 --> 32:19.647
Get in the car, kids.
Diane, get in the car.

32:19.730 --> 32:22.150
Steven, wait a minute. Steven,
let's listen to the man.

32:22.233 --> 32:24.777
Fine, you listen to him.
I wanna go home.

32:24.861 --> 32:26.946
Listen, let's be
sensible about this.

32:27.029 --> 32:29.615
Sensible? What is sensible, honey?
Nobody can help us.

32:29.699 --> 32:32.618
Now, let's just get in the car
and get the hell out of here!

32:32.702 --> 32:34.662
And go where?
It followed us here.

32:34.745 --> 32:37.290
It'll follow us wherever we go.
We can't just keep running.

32:37.373 --> 32:38.624
Where are you from?

32:38.708 --> 32:40.334
I'm from
all over.

32:40.418 --> 32:42.044
This is Katrina.

32:42.253 --> 32:43.337
Katrina?
Mmm-hmm.

32:43.421 --> 32:44.839
Hi, Katrina.

32:45.131 --> 32:46.507
What's that?

32:46.591 --> 32:48.384
It's my medicine bag.

32:49.552 --> 32:50.720
Charms.

32:51.637 --> 32:52.722
See?

33:02.523 --> 33:04.734
The house is okay?
You're sure?

33:04.942 --> 33:07.361
E. Buzz agrees.
It's okay for now.

33:13.075 --> 33:16.078
Oh, the dog agrees, huh? Gee,
that's terrific, isn't it?

33:16.162 --> 33:17.246
Yes.

33:19.123 --> 33:20.416
Your car.

33:23.169 --> 33:24.629
STEVEN; Yeah?

33:26.923 --> 33:28.299
Very angry-

33:29.842 --> 33:31.052
Uh-huh.

33:31.928 --> 33:33.304
I'll fix it.

33:34.305 --> 33:35.723
Make it happy?

33:43.981 --> 33:45.107
Okay.

33:58.955 --> 34:01.457
I've read about these
rain dances. I know.

34:01.541 --> 34:02.542
I understand,
Tangina.

34:02.625 --> 34:04.377
We don't need rain.

34:04.877 --> 34:07.797
I can't say that
Steven fully trusts him yet.

34:08.047 --> 34:10.299
Well, you can't
blame him, I mean...

34:10.382 --> 34:13.511
Yeah, okay. Well, thanks, Tangina.
We will. Bye.

34:19.183 --> 34:22.562
Honey, she says he's okay. I think
we should give him a chance.

34:22.645 --> 34:23.728
Tangina says he's okay?

34:23.813 --> 34:24.981
Yeah.

34:25.313 --> 34:26.357
Oh, that's great.

34:26.440 --> 34:27.650
Keep an open mind, Steven.

34:29.569 --> 34:32.196
Diane, I mean, really.
This is bizarre.

34:33.155 --> 34:36.033
You know, look, I've got
nothing against these people.

34:36.117 --> 34:39.411
You <i>know,</i> I <i>mean,</i> I read
<i>Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee.</i>

34:39.495 --> 34:41.539
I got through most
of the chapters.

34:41.621 --> 34:43.373
I got some Indian
in me, I think.

34:43.456 --> 34:46.377
A sixteenth, my mother
will never admit to it.

34:46.460 --> 34:49.045
But honey, I mean,
what if this guy

34:49.672 --> 34:52.592
is, like, an escapee
from the tribal asylum?

34:54.342 --> 34:56.596
Mom,
come look at this!

35:02.184 --> 35:03.811
Oh, my God!

35:08.858 --> 35:10.568
I don't believe it!

35:39.764 --> 35:40.973
What are you doing?

35:41.057 --> 35:43.309
Oh, hi, Mom. I'm going to
help protect the family now.

35:43.392 --> 35:44.727
Let me see.

35:46.520 --> 35:48.439
Come outside, Robbie.
Hey, I'm a big guy now.

35:48.522 --> 35:50.733
And I'm still your mother. Go
in the house and wait for me.

35:50.816 --> 35:52.234
Thanks, Mom.

35:53.861 --> 35:55.696
He wants to be a man.

35:55.780 --> 35:57.156
Well, there are a lot
of ways to be a man.

35:57.239 --> 36:00.951
I'm not sure wearing claw marks
and war paint is one of them.

36:01.035 --> 36:02.745
How would you know?

36:04.747 --> 36:05.831
What?

36:08.000 --> 36:10.044
You're not a man, are you?

36:11.253 --> 36:14.215
Okay, I'm not a man.
But you're not a mother!

36:15.007 --> 36:16.884
It is my job to do
everything I can

36:16.967 --> 36:19.679
to make my children
part of a normal world.

36:19.762 --> 36:22.682
A world of school,
and friends, and lovers,

36:22.765 --> 36:25.226
and families of
their own, someday.

36:25.685 --> 36:27.353
Well, that's good.

36:29.146 --> 36:30.648
Right, I know.

36:32.316 --> 36:34.694
And I hope that they'll learn
to forget all this soon.

36:34.777 --> 36:37.196
They cannot learn by forgetting.

36:37.279 --> 36:38.489
Well, what would you have me do,

36:38.572 --> 36:40.783
I mean, they're just
children, for God's sake.

36:40.866 --> 36:44.036
Children have fought wars.
They've built nations.

36:44.453 --> 36:46.789
They are strong
and have courage.

36:47.415 --> 36:50.126
Don't treat them any less than
that because they're young.

36:59.969 --> 37:01.470
Taylor!

37:02.138 --> 37:03.389
Taylor!

37:04.932 --> 37:06.142
Taylor!

37:06.684 --> 37:08.436
Okay, Taylor, okay.

37:08.936 --> 37:10.855
Okay, huh? Huh? Okay.

37:11.355 --> 37:12.898
You can stay in the house, okay?

37:12.982 --> 37:15.484
You can have my aura, my spirits,
the ghosts, the whole deal.

37:15.568 --> 37:18.696
The whole cazaba! But keep
your hands off my car!

37:18.988 --> 37:21.949
Okay? Hands off! It's
worse than it was before.

37:22.032 --> 37:23.409
Car's still angry, huh?

37:23.492 --> 37:25.995
Angry? That car
is pissed!

37:38.507 --> 37:43.804
<i>God is in his holy temple</i>

37:44.555 --> 37:48.851
<i>Earthly thoughts be silent now</i>

37:50.436 --> 37:55.733
<i>While with</i> reverence we assemble

37:55.858 --> 38:00.613
<i>And before his presence bow</i>

38:01.614 --> 38:03.824
Come on,
Carol Anne. It's raining!

38:03.908 --> 38:05.910
Come on! What's wrong?

38:06.368 --> 38:09.955
<i>He is with us now and ever</i>

38:10.039 --> 38:11.916
Carol Anne, come on!
Let's go.

38:11.999 --> 38:13.375
Mom, Dad!

38:13.501 --> 38:16.170
<i>As we call upon his name</i>

38:17.505 --> 38:22.593
<i>Aiding every good endeavor</i>

38:23.302 --> 38:25.638
<i>Guiding upward every aim</i>

38:25.721 --> 38:29.141
Honey, come inside.
You're getting soaked!

38:30.059 --> 38:31.685
Come on, sweetie.

38:40.194 --> 38:41.821
Can we help you?

38:41.904 --> 38:43.989
Haven't I seen you
somewhere before?

38:44.073 --> 38:45.741
That is possible!

38:46.075 --> 38:48.869
I get around.
I love getting around.

38:49.495 --> 38:51.580
Love talking to people.

38:52.248 --> 38:53.999
Even on a rainy day.

39:01.423 --> 39:03.133
Ha! Dog's shedding.

39:04.927 --> 39:06.095
Hi!

39:06.929 --> 39:07.972
Hi.

39:08.055 --> 39:09.807
I saw you at the shopping mall.

39:09.890 --> 39:14.311
Sure you did. I remember
your little angel, here.

39:14.687 --> 39:17.022
Allow me to introduce myself.

39:17.398 --> 39:18.774
Henry Kane.

39:20.442 --> 39:21.485
Mom!

39:22.111 --> 39:23.737
You know, I got to tell
you, we've had, uh...

39:23.821 --> 39:26.448
We've had enough of door-to-door
salesmen, if you don't mind.

39:26.532 --> 39:28.033
Reverend Kane!

39:28.617 --> 39:30.828
What I sell is free!

39:31.453 --> 39:34.290
Mind if I come in and
talk to you about it?

39:34.832 --> 39:37.167
Mom, I don't feel well.

39:38.127 --> 39:39.169
You know, I gotta...

39:39.253 --> 39:41.714
Maybe, we'll just talk
from here, all right?

39:41.797 --> 39:43.883
Come inside, baby. I
want to take your temperature.

39:43.966 --> 39:45.593
Come on, Robbie.

39:57.313 --> 40:00.024
I'm glad we have this
opportunity to talk

40:00.441 --> 40:02.735
with your family out of the way.

40:03.152 --> 40:07.156
Because I believe you
have a problem here.

40:08.115 --> 40:09.158
Oh, yeah?

40:09.241 --> 40:10.326
Yeah.

40:11.201 --> 40:15.247
I believe, there's an Indian
living here with you?

40:17.166 --> 40:18.334
Taylor.

40:19.585 --> 40:22.796
So that's what
he calls himself now.

40:25.382 --> 40:27.051
You are in danger!

40:27.718 --> 40:29.345
What do you mean?

40:29.678 --> 40:35.059
I'm with an organization whose
concern is families like your own,

40:35.851 --> 40:40.773
families in crisis that are
preyed upon by charlatans

40:40.856 --> 40:43.400
with fake magic
and false solutions!

40:43.734 --> 40:46.445
Now, I don't expect
you to believe me now,

40:46.528 --> 40:49.531
but let me come in and
talk to you about it.

40:50.699 --> 40:53.410
I don't know. This is just crazy.
This is nuts.

40:54.078 --> 40:59.541
Please! Open your heart and
your mind to what I'm saying.

41:00.459 --> 41:02.753
He is dangerous!

41:30.656 --> 41:35.285
I can see that he has a
strong hold on this family.

41:36.245 --> 41:41.333
Who do your wife and children
turn to with their problems?

41:43.043 --> 41:44.670
They turn to him.

41:45.379 --> 41:47.006
Now, don't they?

41:47.089 --> 41:49.842
They don't trust you

41:51.051 --> 41:52.261
anymore.

41:52.803 --> 41:54.430
What you fear

41:56.598 --> 42:00.602
is that you're not man enough

42:01.770 --> 42:06.108
to hold this family together.

42:08.652 --> 42:10.863
HOW do you know?

42:11.071 --> 42:12.406
Because,

42:13.866 --> 42:15.367
I'm smart.

42:18.370 --> 42:20.122
And I'm your friend.

42:22.666 --> 42:27.546
And I know what
you are thinking.

42:30.632 --> 42:31.717
How?

42:32.426 --> 42:33.469
Now,

42:34.636 --> 42:35.971
let me in.

42:37.347 --> 42:39.308
And let's talk about it.

42:43.437 --> 42:45.606
Let me in!

42:47.191 --> 42:48.859
You're my friend?

42:50.319 --> 42:52.738
Let me in!

42:55.491 --> 42:57.159
CAROL ANNE; Daddy?

42:59.870 --> 43:02.790
Now! Before it's too late!

43:06.627 --> 43:07.669
No.

43:07.961 --> 43:11.632
You're gonna die in there!
All of you!

43:11.882 --> 43:14.843
You are gonna die!

43:15.469 --> 43:17.471
Get the hell out of here!

43:23.519 --> 43:25.020
Sorry to see

43:26.105 --> 43:28.273
you're still unconvinced.

43:37.449 --> 43:39.660
A pleasure visiting with you.

43:40.869 --> 43:45.707
<i>As we call upon his name</i>

43:47.209 --> 43:52.339
<i>Aiding every good endeavor</i>

43:52.965 --> 43:58.387
<i>Guiding upward every aim</i>

44:17.281 --> 44:18.740
You did good.

44:20.409 --> 44:22.077
Who was that?

44:23.871 --> 44:25.664
That was him.

44:27.833 --> 44:28.917
Him?

44:31.920 --> 44:34.006
What are you talking about?

44:34.506 --> 44:36.550
He was testing your power.

44:38.385 --> 44:41.096
He comes in many forms,
but that was him.

44:46.018 --> 44:49.271
Now you're hooked. You're
on the path of a warrior.

44:49.897 --> 44:53.275
Hooked? Hey, wait. Taylor,
what are you talking about?

44:53.775 --> 44:57.112
Your confrontation with him
was a drain on your power.

44:57.571 --> 45:00.282
We don't have much time.
We must prepare.

45:01.450 --> 45:02.701
Prepare?

45:05.412 --> 45:06.622
Oh, God.

45:24.056 --> 45:25.724
Tequila.
Ta kill ya!

45:26.308 --> 45:27.851
You want a hit?

45:28.560 --> 45:31.313
No. I used to drink.
I had to give it up.

45:32.397 --> 45:33.482
Bad dreams.

45:33.649 --> 45:34.733
Mmm.

45:37.819 --> 45:39.488
You see something?

45:40.781 --> 45:41.823
No.

45:44.076 --> 45:45.827
What are you doing?

45:50.040 --> 45:51.541
Seeking power.

45:54.086 --> 45:55.337
Me, too.

45:59.216 --> 46:02.219
You feel like a leaf at the
mercy of the wind, don't you?

46:02.844 --> 46:06.515
Yep. That's right.
That's me.

46:08.100 --> 46:10.644
Since the day you were born,
one way or another,

46:10.727 --> 46:12.938
someone has been doing
something to you.

46:17.150 --> 46:19.945
No, I don't...
I don't think that's true.

46:20.028 --> 46:23.073
They've been doing something
to you against your will.

46:23.532 --> 46:25.617
And by now,
you're feeling helpless,

46:25.701 --> 46:27.703
like a leaf in the wind.

46:35.794 --> 46:38.422
Taylor, it would
help me out a lot

46:38.505 --> 46:39.923
if you'd just say
what's on your mind

46:40.007 --> 46:41.425
so I could understand you.

46:42.801 --> 46:44.553
You understand me.

46:47.556 --> 46:50.225
No matter how much you like
to feel sorry for yourself,

46:52.144 --> 46:54.104
you have to change that.

46:55.731 --> 46:57.232
I'm a warrior.

46:59.067 --> 47:01.987
A warrior would rather
be defeated and die

47:02.070 --> 47:04.197
than act against his nature.

47:07.075 --> 47:09.286
That is the path
you've chosen to take,

47:10.162 --> 47:12.205
whether you know it or not.

47:14.291 --> 47:16.918
You should assume
full responsibility.

47:19.004 --> 47:20.922
Responsibility for what?

47:21.256 --> 47:23.050
Responsibility for everything.

47:23.842 --> 47:25.844
Everything in your world.

47:31.391 --> 47:32.809
Come on, Robbie.

47:38.648 --> 47:40.525
Robbie, you're supposed
to clean your braces

47:40.609 --> 47:42.110
and come downstairs now.

47:42.194 --> 47:44.446
Shut up, jerko!
I'm doing it, okay?

47:44.529 --> 47:46.281
Don't "okay" me!

47:46.448 --> 47:47.824
You're a pest, you know that?

48:11.181 --> 48:12.307
Don't do that.

48:12.391 --> 48:14.017
I didn't do anything.

48:14.101 --> 48:15.644
You're such an infant.

48:26.822 --> 48:27.781
Ready?
Mmm-hmm.

48:27.864 --> 48:28.907
Where's Robbie?

48:28.990 --> 48:30.784
He says he's coming.

48:30.867 --> 48:31.910
Okay.

48:31.993 --> 48:33.620
Kiss Katrina, too.

48:34.162 --> 48:35.622
Good night, girls.
Good night.

48:35.705 --> 48:37.165
Rob, come on!

48:38.291 --> 48:40.001
Good night, sweetie.
Good night, Daddy.

48:41.294 --> 48:42.671
Ooh! The telephone.

48:43.505 --> 48:44.673
Hello?

48:45.173 --> 48:46.258
Yes.

48:47.175 --> 48:48.260
Okay.

48:48.343 --> 48:50.387
Dad, it's for you.
Oh.

48:50.470 --> 48:52.222
Oh, maybe it's
the insurance company.

48:53.348 --> 48:54.683
With good news.

48:58.395 --> 48:59.521
Hello?

49:02.607 --> 49:03.692
<i>Die!</i>

49:12.200 --> 49:13.952
Mom!

49:14.035 --> 49:15.036
Mom!

49:15.120 --> 49:16.413
Oh, my God!

49:16.496 --> 49:17.664
Stay here, baby.

49:17.747 --> 49:18.999
Robbie!

49:20.333 --> 49:21.877
We're coming, Robbie!

49:23.587 --> 49:24.629
Rob!

49:26.089 --> 49:27.299
Robbie!

49:31.219 --> 49:32.804
Dad, help me!

49:32.888 --> 49:33.972
Robbie!

49:34.473 --> 49:37.100
Taylor! Help us!

49:37.184 --> 49:38.393
Taylor!

49:39.311 --> 49:40.395
Please!

49:43.315 --> 49:45.317
Help! Taylor!

49:46.067 --> 49:47.277
Taylor!

49:48.737 --> 49:50.322
Hold tight, Robbie!

49:52.657 --> 49:53.909
The plug!

49:55.076 --> 49:56.411
No!

50:10.800 --> 50:11.885
Get out!

50:16.515 --> 50:17.849
Taylor!

50:17.933 --> 50:19.601
Taylor, where the hell were you?

50:20.060 --> 50:23.647
We're not safe here anymore. My
son almost dies and you sit here!

50:23.730 --> 50:25.690
I was protecting Carol Anne.

50:25.774 --> 50:30.904
It's her he's after,
not Robbie, not you or Diane.

50:34.115 --> 50:35.450
Carol Anne.

50:38.411 --> 50:41.414
Why the hell
won't you leave us alone?

50:44.626 --> 50:46.253
- Dad!
- Steven!

50:47.170 --> 50:51.466
<i>You can't keep her!
I am not dead!</i>

51:42.517 --> 51:43.893
He's still here.

51:46.104 --> 51:47.897
He feels she belongs to him.

51:48.481 --> 51:49.691
But why?

51:50.191 --> 51:51.443
I'm not sure,

51:51.776 --> 51:53.862
but he's used to getting
what he wants.

51:55.030 --> 51:56.281
Taylor.

51:57.490 --> 51:58.658
Who is he?

51:59.701 --> 52:00.869
What is he?

52:01.036 --> 52:03.204
He's a man filled with a demon,

52:03.705 --> 52:06.541
lost in a dimension
that surrounds our world.

52:07.959 --> 52:11.588
This entity believes that his
world and ours are the same.

52:12.672 --> 52:14.674
Why doesn't he know he's dead?

52:14.966 --> 52:16.092
Because he isn't.

52:18.053 --> 52:19.304
How can that be?

52:19.387 --> 52:21.181
Nothing really dies.

52:23.224 --> 52:25.894
Like a caterpillar
becomes a butterfly,

52:26.686 --> 52:30.106
death only transforms us
into another state of being.

52:31.733 --> 52:33.401
This man was evil

52:34.903 --> 52:37.113
and his soul remains evil

52:37.197 --> 52:39.824
because he chooses
not to see the light

52:39.908 --> 52:42.452
and pass on
to a different consciousness.

52:46.539 --> 52:48.208
How are we going
to fight this thing?

52:48.458 --> 52:50.251
Until we learn
how to defeat him,

52:51.920 --> 52:53.588
we do not let him win.

52:54.005 --> 52:55.882
That's a hell of a plan.
That's a lot of crap.

52:55.965 --> 52:57.258
I suppose you have
a plan of your own.

52:57.342 --> 52:58.677
That's a lot of crap!
Shh.

52:59.427 --> 53:01.846
Listen.
Don't come apart now.

53:04.974 --> 53:06.685
This spirit
is very clever.

53:07.686 --> 53:09.938
He knows your strength
is your love,

53:10.230 --> 53:11.856
and he hates you for that.

53:13.066 --> 53:15.402
He's been trying to pull
this family apart,

53:16.152 --> 53:18.154
and he will continue to try.

53:20.407 --> 53:21.908
If he succeeds,

53:21.991 --> 53:24.119
he will possess Carol Anne

53:25.245 --> 53:26.663
and destroy your spirit.

54:55.293 --> 54:56.836
Hi!

54:56.920 --> 54:58.129
Tangina!

54:58.213 --> 54:59.881
Hi, Diane.

54:59.964 --> 55:01.591
What are you doing here?

55:01.674 --> 55:05.345
Sorry to come unannounced, sweetie,
but I need to speak with you.

55:05.428 --> 55:06.805
Oh, I'm glad to see you.

55:06.888 --> 55:10.475
Oh, good. 'Cause we're
running out of time.

55:10.558 --> 55:13.436
Mmm-hmm,
below the old cemetery,

55:14.062 --> 55:17.065
what seems to be a tomb
with many bodies in it,

55:17.899 --> 55:20.568
directly below your house.

55:21.736 --> 55:23.112
Who are they?

55:23.196 --> 55:26.366
The researchers don't know
who these people were.

55:26.825 --> 55:28.910
There are no marked graves.

55:29.911 --> 55:33.164
There are, however, records
of a religious sect

55:33.248 --> 55:35.250
that mysteriously disappeared.

55:37.627 --> 55:39.003
What happened?

55:39.087 --> 55:41.381
Their spiritual leader
was a medium

55:41.464 --> 55:44.175
who led his followers
out to California

55:44.259 --> 55:48.137
in the early 1800s
to start a utopian society.

55:49.389 --> 55:52.225
They disappeared
near Cuesta Verde

55:53.434 --> 55:58.273
and were believed
massacred by Indians.

55:59.941 --> 56:01.609
This could be them.

56:12.287 --> 56:13.621
This funny?

56:17.500 --> 56:19.043
Well, no, uh...

56:20.044 --> 56:21.087
I love the health club,
you know.

56:21.170 --> 56:23.590
I'm just wondering when I
get the key to my locker?

56:26.259 --> 56:28.428
Sense of humor is good.

56:30.930 --> 56:32.891
You're going to need it.

57:26.069 --> 57:29.697
The entity has revealed
his essence to you, his enemy.

57:32.033 --> 57:35.995
Now that you've seen each
other, there'll be no mistakes.

57:37.246 --> 57:38.873
Take this smoke.

57:48.049 --> 57:49.217
Smoke,

57:50.426 --> 57:53.054
make him one with power
and knowledge.

57:55.348 --> 57:57.684
Here is a photo of those people.

57:58.434 --> 58:00.353
I think you should
have a look at it.

58:02.647 --> 58:04.732
I know this is
hard for you, dear,

58:05.400 --> 58:08.194
but I need your
verification on something.

58:09.737 --> 58:13.032
You see, I don't really trust

58:13.116 --> 58:15.743
my instincts anymore.

58:18.246 --> 58:20.957
Now, hold this one

58:22.250 --> 58:24.252
and tell me what you feel.

58:29.465 --> 58:31.050
Oh, my God, I've seen him!

58:31.342 --> 58:32.885
I thought so.
Where?

58:32.969 --> 58:36.764
Oh, my God. Here!
At the mall! At our house!

58:37.223 --> 58:38.307
Who is he?

58:38.391 --> 58:40.893
Tell me what you feel.
Just tell me what you feel.

58:40.977 --> 58:42.854
What do you want me to do?
Who is he?

58:42.937 --> 58:44.355
I've consulted others.

58:44.439 --> 58:47.233
They've told me things,
but they said you know more!

58:47.316 --> 58:48.776
I don't know anything!

58:48.860 --> 58:50.319
Yes, you do!

58:51.029 --> 58:52.363
You traveled to a dimension

58:52.447 --> 58:54.782
few people have ever
traveled to incarnate!

58:55.783 --> 58:58.286
Your daughter is
highly clairvoyant!

58:59.037 --> 59:01.289
As was your mother, I suspect

59:01.789 --> 59:03.791
As you are as well!

59:04.500 --> 59:06.878
Now tell me what you feel!

59:12.633 --> 59:14.594
It is him.
It's the preacher.

59:16.137 --> 59:18.848
They're following him in death
like they did in life.

59:20.058 --> 59:21.684
<i>They seal themselves
in the cavern,</i>

59:21.768 --> 59:24.479
<i>because Kane tells them the
end of the world is coming.</i>

59:26.689 --> 59:30.401
Come with me!

59:30.485 --> 59:33.404
<i>The day he predicts
for the end comes and goes,</i>

59:34.155 --> 59:36.574
<i>but Kane won't let them leave!</i>

59:36.657 --> 59:39.994
Don't! No, please!
Please don't!

59:40.745 --> 59:42.872
Please don't!

59:46.584 --> 59:47.835
Please...

59:47.960 --> 59:49.295
Oh, Diane.

59:50.880 --> 59:53.966
Yes, it all makes sense now.

59:54.842 --> 59:57.929
When you brought Carol
Anne back to this world,

59:59.055 --> 01:00:01.224
his followers became restless

01:00:01.349 --> 01:00:04.685
because they had tasted
the light of her being,

01:00:04.769 --> 01:00:06.562
her life force.

01:00:08.147 --> 01:00:09.857
Now he wants her back.

01:00:11.651 --> 01:00:14.862
This person is no longer human.

01:00:17.448 --> 01:00:19.033
He is the beast.

01:00:19.951 --> 01:00:25.039
<i>Earthly thoughts be silent now</i>

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:28.876
<i>While with reverence...</i>

01:00:29.377 --> 01:00:31.754
You must take your family
back to Cuesta Verde.

01:00:34.507 --> 01:00:35.591
What?

01:00:36.759 --> 01:00:38.845
The evil spirit
that is stalking you,

01:00:39.554 --> 01:00:41.180
it knows who you are,

01:00:41.389 --> 01:00:43.808
where you are, how to find you,

01:00:44.976 --> 01:00:46.644
what your weaknesses are.

01:00:46.978 --> 01:00:48.855
Your best bet is
to confront him,

01:00:49.063 --> 01:00:51.274
surprise him on his own ground.

01:00:52.817 --> 01:00:55.611
But, Taylor, what about Diane
and the kids?

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:58.072
They are your power

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:00.950
and you are theirs.

01:01:21.095 --> 01:01:23.514
Uh, are things
desperate, Taylor?

01:01:25.224 --> 01:01:28.728
What you see as desperate,
I see as inevitable.

01:01:30.646 --> 01:01:32.440
I've done all I can.

01:01:33.524 --> 01:01:34.942
I must be leaving you now.

01:01:39.447 --> 01:01:40.865
I'll take you home.

01:01:41.449 --> 01:01:43.034
Um, guys,

01:01:43.743 --> 01:01:45.620
you know, there's, uh,
no reason to get depressed.

01:01:45.703 --> 01:01:47.830
I mean, Taylor's not here.
That's all right.

01:01:47.914 --> 01:01:51.667
We'll just keep on going just like we've
been doing, as a family, as a unit...

01:01:53.419 --> 01:01:56.714
Son, you know, I've told you
about the helmet and eating...

01:01:57.298 --> 01:01:58.799
I told you, I'm not hungry.

01:01:59.926 --> 01:02:01.344
Miniature golf.

01:02:01.636 --> 01:02:03.721
Tomorrow we can play
some miniature golf!

01:02:04.096 --> 01:02:05.640
We can get our putters...

01:02:07.099 --> 01:02:08.935
How about bowling, huh?

01:02:09.477 --> 01:02:11.145
You like bowling, sweet pea.

01:02:12.188 --> 01:02:14.440
Nature hike, Rob.
Huh? We'll get...

01:02:14.941 --> 01:02:16.317
Brisk walk?

01:02:17.652 --> 01:02:19.403
I know.
The water slide, huh?

01:02:19.612 --> 01:02:22.949
We'll take E. Buzz, we'll put water
wings on him, we'll shove him down,

01:02:23.157 --> 01:02:25.284
and laugh, won't we?

01:03:11.330 --> 01:03:13.833
So, after
Alice fell down the hole,

01:03:13.916 --> 01:03:15.626
Why'd she drink
from that bottle?

01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:17.795
Because it said
"drink me" on it.

01:03:18.045 --> 01:03:20.589
Oh. Were they going
to capture her

01:03:21.090 --> 01:03:22.633
and take her someplace bad?

01:03:23.467 --> 01:03:25.886
Yes, but Alice
gets home all right, remember?

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:30.182
Did she know why they
wanted to hurt her?

01:03:30.808 --> 01:03:32.393
I don't think so, honey.

01:03:34.395 --> 01:03:35.896
'Cause I know.

01:03:36.564 --> 01:03:37.732
You know what?

01:03:38.149 --> 01:03:39.775
Why they're here.

01:03:42.069 --> 01:03:44.822
Why, baby?
Why are they here?

01:03:45.823 --> 01:03:48.159
Because they don't know
where else to go.

01:04:24.278 --> 01:04:26.238
God! Oh!

01:04:31.619 --> 01:04:32.912
God!

01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:57.436
<i>God is in his holy temple</i>

01:04:58.437 --> 01:05:03.192
<i>God is in his holy temple</i>

01:05:36.183 --> 01:05:37.518
Hi, angel!

01:05:46.026 --> 01:05:47.653
Are you okay, Dad?

01:05:48.195 --> 01:05:49.280
Yeah.

01:05:50.030 --> 01:05:52.783
I just want to
give my little girl a hug.

01:05:54.702 --> 01:05:55.786
Oh!

01:05:55.870 --> 01:05:59.373
Hey, your mom and I
would like to talk alone.

01:06:01.375 --> 01:06:03.586
Go put on your nightie, honey.

01:06:07.631 --> 01:06:09.258
What's going on, Steve?

01:06:12.428 --> 01:06:14.221
Nothing. I just
want us to be alone.

01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:16.390
Carol Anne's upset.

01:06:18.225 --> 01:06:19.477
Does that feel good?

01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:21.270
I should dry her hair.

01:06:21.562 --> 01:06:23.355
She's all right.
She's safe.

01:06:23.689 --> 01:06:25.024
Steven, come on!

01:06:27.234 --> 01:06:28.277
Honey!

01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:30.029
Is that good?
Honey!

01:06:30.571 --> 01:06:32.281
Don't! Not now!

01:06:32.364 --> 01:06:33.741
Why? When?

01:06:34.074 --> 01:06:35.326
What do you mean?

01:06:35.409 --> 01:06:37.203
Diane, I have needs, too!

01:06:37.495 --> 01:06:40.915
It seems to me, your needs have been
fulfilled by the bottle tonight!

01:06:49.381 --> 01:06:50.591
Oh!

01:06:51.091 --> 01:06:52.384
Steven, don't.

01:06:52.468 --> 01:06:56.430
Diane, are you accusing
me of being drunk?

01:06:56.514 --> 01:06:58.057
I'm not accusing you
of anything.

01:06:58.140 --> 01:06:59.767
Yes, you are, but that's
what you're thinking.

01:06:59.850 --> 01:07:01.101
No, I'm not! Yes, that's
what you're thinking.

01:07:01.185 --> 01:07:03.395
I know you! That's
what you're thinking!

01:07:05.606 --> 01:07:06.857
Spare me, Steven.

01:07:06.941 --> 01:07:10.444
Diane, you remember,
just the other day,

01:07:11.570 --> 01:07:14.532
when you were seven and you
were helping your mommy

01:07:14.615 --> 01:07:17.117
plant flowers in the garden?

01:07:19.286 --> 01:07:20.996
You saw it clearly!

01:07:21.330 --> 01:07:22.915
How the hell do you know that?

01:07:23.165 --> 01:07:25.292
'Cause I am smart.

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:29.588
Oh, Mommy Jess...
Don't cry.

01:07:29.672 --> 01:07:31.882
Mommy Jess,
don't pout. No!

01:07:31.966 --> 01:07:33.968
You think that all
of our troubles

01:07:34.051 --> 01:07:36.053
are because of Carol Anne!

01:07:36.637 --> 01:07:38.556
You wish Carol Anne

01:07:38.639 --> 01:07:40.933
had never been given birth to!
No!

01:07:44.311 --> 01:07:48.023
You never wanted Carol Anne!

01:07:48.107 --> 01:07:49.400
Shh!

01:07:49.483 --> 01:07:51.569
But you thought it!
You thought it!

01:07:51.694 --> 01:07:53.445
You thought it, you thought it, baby!
No!

01:07:53.529 --> 01:07:54.697
Shh.

01:07:55.114 --> 01:07:56.532
You thought about it!

01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:00.828
You thought that?
You thought it! Shh!

01:08:02.204 --> 01:08:03.747
You thought it!

01:08:07.876 --> 01:08:08.919
Diane's had secrets!

01:08:09.837 --> 01:08:11.255
No, don't!
Diane!

01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:13.007
Don't! Don't touch me!

01:08:13.048 --> 01:08:14.758
Steven!

01:08:14.842 --> 01:08:17.303
I know you! I feel you!

01:08:17.386 --> 01:08:21.180
What is wrong with you?
What is happening to you?

01:08:22.474 --> 01:08:24.768
Why are you doing this?

01:08:24.852 --> 01:08:26.854
What is happening to you?

01:08:28.147 --> 01:08:30.189
Steven, stop it!

01:08:31.859 --> 01:08:33.068
Stop it!

01:08:33.152 --> 01:08:36.654
We want the angel!
The sweet pea!

01:08:36.738 --> 01:08:38.616
Stop it, stop it!

01:08:41.702 --> 01:08:43.120
No! Stop it!

01:08:45.538 --> 01:08:48.082
I love you! Damn you!

01:08:48.459 --> 01:08:51.754
He is in his holy temple!

01:08:53.671 --> 01:08:56.383
Don't you know that?
I love you!

01:08:56.466 --> 01:08:58.385
Believe me, I love you!

01:09:03.557 --> 01:09:05.434
Oh, God, leave me alone!

01:09:06.393 --> 01:09:09.897
What is it?
What's happening to you?

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:14.234
What's going on?

01:09:14.318 --> 01:09:16.569
Leave me alone.
Leave me alone.

01:09:17.071 --> 01:09:19.073
What is it?
God, please!

01:09:19.156 --> 01:09:20.491
What's the matter?

01:09:20.573 --> 01:09:21.658
Oh, God!

01:09:21.742 --> 01:09:23.452
Steven...
God!

01:09:23.535 --> 01:09:25.621
Steven, what is it?
What's the matter?

01:09:28.582 --> 01:09:32.127
What is it? What is it, Steven?
Oh, God!

01:09:32.211 --> 01:09:33.587
What is it?

01:09:37.925 --> 01:09:39.176
Oh, God!

01:09:57.945 --> 01:09:59.405
Honey! Steven!

01:09:59.613 --> 01:10:01.448
Wake up! Wake up!

01:10:07.413 --> 01:10:09.164
Wake up! Wake up!

01:10:38.485 --> 01:10:39.695
Robbie!

01:10:39.778 --> 01:10:41.488
Robbie!
Carol Anne!

01:11:13.645 --> 01:11:15.355
Kids, where are you?

01:11:16.064 --> 01:11:18.025
Stay put!
We'll find you!

01:11:31.079 --> 01:11:32.289
Babies?

01:12:08.867 --> 01:12:12.037
Daddy, help me!
Help me, please!

01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:16.583
Dad!
Help me, Mom! Dad!

01:12:19.253 --> 01:12:20.504
No! No!

01:12:21.922 --> 01:12:24.967
Oh, Steven! No!

01:12:26.385 --> 01:12:27.594
Steven!

01:12:30.597 --> 01:12:31.807
No! No!

01:12:49.741 --> 01:12:51.368
Oh, God!

01:13:01.461 --> 01:13:02.629
Oh, honey.

01:13:05.632 --> 01:13:07.634
Carol Anne! Robbie!
Robbie!

01:13:17.728 --> 01:13:19.396
I'll check in here.
All right?

01:13:19.479 --> 01:13:20.480
Yeah.

01:13:23.650 --> 01:13:24.818
Robbie?

01:13:24.902 --> 01:13:26.278
Carol Anne?

01:13:26.904 --> 01:13:29.323
Oh, babies,
please answer me! Please!

01:13:44.129 --> 01:13:45.505
Are you in here?

01:13:48.216 --> 01:13:50.177
Kids! Kids, please come!

01:13:54.264 --> 01:13:56.308
Robbie! Carol Anne!

01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:01.104
Kids?

01:14:16.954 --> 01:14:18.163
Robbie!

01:14:20.707 --> 01:14:22.376
Carol Anne! Please!

01:14:25.837 --> 01:14:26.838
Mom!

01:14:28.715 --> 01:14:30.550
Oh, baby, baby,
are you all right?

01:14:32.886 --> 01:14:33.929
Diane?

01:14:35.263 --> 01:14:36.473
Where's Carol Anne?

01:14:36.556 --> 01:14:38.475
We can't find her.
I don't know.

01:14:38.558 --> 01:14:39.893
The garage!

01:14:40.769 --> 01:14:42.062
Carol Anne!

01:14:42.145 --> 01:14:43.146
Carol Anne!

01:14:43.230 --> 01:14:44.940
Baby, where are you?

01:14:46.108 --> 01:14:47.484
Carol Anne!

01:14:48.694 --> 01:14:50.070
Carol Anne!

01:14:51.238 --> 01:14:52.447
Carol Anne!
Carol Anne!

01:14:52.531 --> 01:14:53.740
Where are you?

01:14:54.074 --> 01:14:55.242
Honey?

01:14:55.742 --> 01:14:57.077
Oh, God.

01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:58.912
Carol Anne, open
the door, sweet pea!

01:14:58.996 --> 01:15:00.038
Oh, baby!

01:15:00.122 --> 01:15:01.748
Come on, honey, open the door!

01:15:01.832 --> 01:15:03.500
Lift up the knob, sweetheart.

01:15:03.583 --> 01:15:04.668
Come on honey, open the...

01:15:04.751 --> 01:15:05.836
What is it?

01:15:05.919 --> 01:15:08.213
Oh, sweetheart, that wasn't
Daddy upstairs in the bathroom.

01:15:08.296 --> 01:15:09.297
You know that!

01:15:09.423 --> 01:15:10.841
Oh, baby!

01:15:11.508 --> 01:15:12.759
What happened?
Jesus!

01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:15.012
Mom!

01:15:17.097 --> 01:15:18.098
Mom!

01:15:18.765 --> 01:15:20.308
- Dad, watch out!
- Look out!

01:15:20.892 --> 01:15:21.977
Mom!

01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:24.229
Okay, Diane, get in the car!

01:15:24.771 --> 01:15:26.106
Go, go, baby, 90!

01:15:26.148 --> 01:15:27.858
- Open the door, Carol Anne.
- Open the door!

01:15:27.941 --> 01:15:29.067
Open the door!

01:15:32.446 --> 01:15:34.072
Steven, come on!

01:15:34.156 --> 01:15:35.615
Daddy, hurry!

01:15:36.116 --> 01:15:37.284
Hurry!

01:15:37.784 --> 01:15:38.952
Go! Go!

01:15:41.621 --> 01:15:43.081
Get us out of here! Go!

01:15:43.165 --> 01:15:44.624
Dad, E. Buzz!

01:15:45.625 --> 01:15:47.252
E. Buzz, get in!

01:15:47.377 --> 01:15:48.545
- Come on, E. Buzz.
- E. Buzz!

01:15:48.628 --> 01:15:50.589
Come on, E. Buzz, get in!
Be a good boy!

01:15:50.672 --> 01:15:51.882
Come on, E. Buzz, get in.

01:15:51.965 --> 01:15:53.383
Come on, E. Buzz!

01:15:53.467 --> 01:15:55.093
Come on, E. Buzz! Get in!

01:15:56.553 --> 01:15:57.763
Come on, Robbie!

01:15:57.846 --> 01:15:58.972
Close the door!

01:16:00.182 --> 01:16:01.475
Dad,
let's get out of here!

01:16:01.558 --> 01:16:02.559
Come on.

01:16:05.604 --> 01:16:06.605
Come on, move!

01:16:06.688 --> 01:16:07.898
- Go!
- It won't move!

01:16:07.981 --> 01:16:09.107
Go!

01:16:09.191 --> 01:16:10.650
It won't start!

01:16:16.448 --> 01:16:17.991
Steven!
Go! Please!

01:16:26.208 --> 01:16:27.417
No! No!

01:16:28.502 --> 01:16:29.836
Look out!

01:16:39.262 --> 01:16:40.680
Move, damn it! Move!

01:16:48.105 --> 01:16:49.731
Get going, Steven!

01:16:51.066 --> 01:16:52.234
Hurry!

01:16:59.866 --> 01:17:00.992
Drive the car!

01:17:01.076 --> 01:17:02.619
Now, move! Move!

01:17:21.888 --> 01:17:23.098
Oh, Jesus!

01:17:50.125 --> 01:17:52.335
We're going back to
Cuesta Verde, aren't we?

01:17:55.088 --> 01:17:56.464
That's right.

01:17:57.299 --> 01:17:58.884
But what about the kids?

01:18:01.595 --> 01:18:03.430
Taylor said we go back
as a family.

01:18:03.513 --> 01:18:05.515
We go back together.
That's all of us.

01:18:07.017 --> 01:18:08.935
Do you believe him, Dad?

01:18:14.774 --> 01:18:16.193
Honey, it was real smart of you

01:18:16.276 --> 01:18:18.111
to hide in the car like that.

01:18:18.195 --> 01:18:19.654
It wasn't my idea.

01:18:19.988 --> 01:18:22.157
Taylor said it was
the only safe place.

01:18:22.699 --> 01:18:24.743
Dad, do you believe him?

01:18:30.457 --> 01:18:32.542
I do... I do believe him, son.
Yeah.

01:18:35.378 --> 01:18:36.755
I do.

01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:45.865
Oh, Tangina.
Thank God.

01:19:46.366 --> 01:19:49.995
I knew you'd be here,
so I had to be here, too.

01:19:50.704 --> 01:19:52.205
We had to come, Tangina.

01:19:52.622 --> 01:19:57.419
I know, but there are many dangers
you must consider, Steven.

01:20:04.342 --> 01:20:05.468
Are you okay, honey?

01:20:05.552 --> 01:20:07.178
Yeah, Mom.
I'm okay.

01:20:17.355 --> 01:20:18.857
Careful, honey.

01:20:19.983 --> 01:20:21.067
Mom!

01:20:21.735 --> 01:20:24.946
Honey, honey, listen. If you don't
want to go through with this,

01:20:25.030 --> 01:20:27.115
we can leave here
right now, okay?

01:20:28.074 --> 01:20:30.535
No, Mom, I do want to go on.

01:20:31.411 --> 01:20:33.079
I love you more than anything.

01:20:33.788 --> 01:20:35.749
You always remember that, okay?

01:20:36.708 --> 01:20:37.751
Okay.

01:21:09.074 --> 01:21:10.450
Oh, no!

01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:12.160
Oh, God, they're all...

01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:16.414
They're all dying here!
Oh, God!

01:21:19.793 --> 01:21:23.254
They're all reaching out
for help that will never come.

01:21:27.133 --> 01:21:29.302
All because they worship him.

01:21:29.386 --> 01:21:32.806
<i>Come with me!</i>

01:21:38.311 --> 01:21:39.479
Diane!

01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:42.232
Carol Anne!

01:21:42.315 --> 01:21:45.026
<i>Steven!
Where are you?</i>

01:21:45.402 --> 01:21:48.738
<i>Daddy, where are you?</i>

01:21:48.822 --> 01:21:51.282
<i>Help! Please!</i>

01:21:53.701 --> 01:21:56.788
Tangina, they are gone!

01:21:57.330 --> 01:21:58.373
They have crossed over!

01:21:58.456 --> 01:22:01.000
Now we have to get them back,
and you know how. Please!

01:22:03.670 --> 01:22:04.838
Taylor!

01:22:06.506 --> 01:22:07.674
Taylor!

01:22:08.591 --> 01:22:09.676
Dad!

01:22:11.511 --> 01:22:12.720
Taylor!

01:22:16.141 --> 01:22:17.142
Dad!

01:22:17.225 --> 01:22:18.685
Taylor!

01:22:20.728 --> 01:22:21.896
Taylor...

01:22:23.857 --> 01:22:25.316
Taylor, where are they?

01:22:25.442 --> 01:22:26.860
I see her!

01:22:28.695 --> 01:22:30.530
This is the way in.

01:22:30.738 --> 01:22:32.365
The entity is with them.

01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:34.784
They're in grave danger.

01:22:34.868 --> 01:22:36.077
Hold on to each other.

01:22:37.412 --> 01:22:39.747
When you find
Diane and Carol Anne,

01:22:40.957 --> 01:22:42.250
band together.

01:22:42.959 --> 01:22:46.087
That will prevent you from
crossing over into eternity.

01:22:47.338 --> 01:22:48.965
I'll try to bring you all back.

01:22:49.299 --> 01:22:53.470
Join together. The light of
the family can defeat him.

01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:57.015
This is the moment you've been
moving towards all your life.

01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:00.727
The entrance is
through the flames.

01:23:05.398 --> 01:23:08.568
Daddy, help!

01:23:11.070 --> 01:23:14.449
This is an illusion!
The beast lies!

01:23:14.532 --> 01:23:16.534
Go through the flames, now!

01:23:18.244 --> 01:23:21.831
<i>God is in his holy temple</i>

01:23:21.915 --> 01:23:25.168
<i>Earthly thoughts be silent now</i>

01:23:25.251 --> 01:23:29.088
<i>God is in his holy temple</i>

01:23:29.714 --> 01:23:32.717
<i>God is in his holy temple</i>

01:23:33.927 --> 01:23:36.346
<i>Earthly thoughts be silent now</i>

01:23:52.779 --> 01:23:53.947
Mom!

01:23:59.410 --> 01:24:01.788
Steven, take the lance!

01:24:06.459 --> 01:24:07.502
No!

01:24:19.931 --> 01:24:22.725
No, don't go, Carol Anne! No!

01:24:25.812 --> 01:24:27.981
Baby, don't go!

01:24:47.250 --> 01:24:48.626
She's gone.

01:24:50.628 --> 01:24:52.130
It's too late.

01:24:55.508 --> 01:24:56.843
I've lost.

01:25:09.355 --> 01:25:10.690
Dad, look!

01:25:26.706 --> 01:25:27.832
Baby.

01:25:28.416 --> 01:25:29.500
Baby.

01:25:46.059 --> 01:25:47.101
Oh!

01:25:48.227 --> 01:25:50.897
Thank God! Thank God!

01:26:08.122 --> 01:26:09.415
Some battle, huh?

01:26:15.922 --> 01:26:18.257
Would you
believe this place?

01:26:34.107 --> 01:26:35.441
Uh, your car.

01:26:36.609 --> 01:26:38.403
Yeah, well, it's happy.

01:26:39.779 --> 01:26:41.030
Not yet.

01:26:42.156 --> 01:26:44.033
How are we going
to make it happy?

01:26:45.618 --> 01:26:47.787
It wants to come home with me.

01:26:49.205 --> 01:26:50.415
You asked it?

01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:51.666
Yes.

01:26:52.917 --> 01:26:54.252
It's sure?

01:26:59.632 --> 01:27:01.592
Okay, it's yours.
Take it.

01:27:14.230 --> 01:27:15.690
We thank you.

01:27:18.192 --> 01:27:19.944
It started right up.

01:27:22.488 --> 01:27:23.906
Bye, Taylor!

01:27:24.407 --> 01:27:25.658
Dad, you
gave our car away?

01:27:25.742 --> 01:27:26.743
Yes.

01:27:26.826 --> 01:27:29.787
But, Steven, we have no...
We need a ride home.

01:27:31.664 --> 01:27:36.377
Taylor! Whoa!
My car needs me, Taylor! Whoa!

01:27:36.461 --> 01:27:37.670
Taylor!

01:27:37.754 --> 01:27:39.505
Taylor!

01:27:39.964 --> 01:27:41.549
My car
wants me, Taylor!

01:27:41.632 --> 01:27:43.468
My car needs me.

01:30:42.897 --> 01:30:43.898
