11:26.903 --> 11:29.036
Last thing we want to do
is shoot it out Waco style

11:29.079 --> 11:30.254
with a bunch of vets
on a hunch.

11:30.298 --> 11:32.735
- That would be
a PR nightmare.

11:32.779 --> 11:34.650
- Yeah, so the best we can
give you right now

11:34.694 --> 11:38.001
is access to our pole-cam feed
and a roster of members.

11:38.045 --> 11:40.047
- Okay, thank you,

11:40.090 --> 11:42.484
and obviously we will
reciprocate in any way we can.

11:46.357 --> 11:48.403
- Hold on.
- What?

11:48.446 --> 11:50.797
- I know one of these names.
- Someone we've worked?

11:50.840 --> 11:52.233
- Chris Zapata,
he's a friend of mine.

11:52.276 --> 11:54.670
We served together in the 75th.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.150
- You two stay in touch?

11:56.193 --> 11:57.978
- Actually, we talked
two weeks ago.

11:58.021 --> 11:59.806
He got wrote up on
a federal weapons charge.

11:59.849 --> 12:01.721
I told him that
I would call the AUSA

12:01.764 --> 12:03.157
and vouch for his character.
Stuff like that.

12:03.200 --> 12:05.681
- Good.
Well then, he needs a favor.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.335
Use it. Get what we need.

12:12.862 --> 12:14.690
- Okay, just so you know,
I think Chris

12:14.734 --> 12:16.779
is still adjusting now that
he's back on the home front.

12:16.823 --> 12:18.999
- Okay.
- And the weapons charge,

12:19.042 --> 12:21.349
he said that he bought an M4
because it felt weird

12:21.392 --> 12:24.221
not to have
a service weapon nearby.

12:24.265 --> 12:25.832
- I mean, I can only imagine
how difficult

12:25.875 --> 12:28.486
it would be to reacclimate.
- But he's a good man.

12:28.530 --> 12:30.880
The closest thing I've ever met
to a real life American hero.

12:31.881 --> 12:32.882
Chris.

12:33.927 --> 12:35.102
- [laughs]

12:36.581 --> 12:38.061
- What's up, buddy?
How are you?

12:38.105 --> 12:39.367
- Good.

12:39.410 --> 12:40.368
- This is Maggie Bell,
my partner.

12:40.411 --> 12:41.848
- Hey, nice to meet you.
- Same.

12:41.891 --> 12:44.894
- Partner, huh?
This FBI business?

12:44.938 --> 12:46.417
- It is.

12:46.461 --> 12:48.245
I know I told you that
I would help you

12:48.289 --> 12:50.291
with, uh, that
M4 possessions charge,

12:50.334 --> 12:51.901
but something came up.

12:51.945 --> 12:53.773
Something we need
your help with.

12:53.816 --> 12:56.906
It should help us
get those charges dropped.

12:56.950 --> 12:58.603
- Sounds good.

12:58.647 --> 13:00.040
- We need to know about
the Lodge.

13:04.609 --> 13:05.828
- Like what?

13:05.872 --> 13:07.525
- For starters,
what goes on inside.

13:07.569 --> 13:10.180
Trey Dawkins was a member.
He blew up the IRS building.

13:10.224 --> 13:12.008
We just picked up
another member, Ryan Davis.

13:12.052 --> 13:15.055
He's responsible for
the federal courthouse bombing.

13:15.098 --> 13:17.318
- Damn, man, that's uh--

13:18.972 --> 13:22.497
I mean it's a bar, OA.
You know, guys just drinking.

13:22.540 --> 13:25.239
Venting their frustrations
about how bad it feels

13:25.282 --> 13:26.980
to get chewed up
and spit out by the service.

13:27.023 --> 13:28.372
- Yeah, like the barracks.

13:28.416 --> 13:30.635
- That's exactly
what it's like.

13:30.679 --> 13:31.941
- You get me inside?

13:33.551 --> 13:36.467
- I mean, don't take this
the wrong way, but no.

13:36.511 --> 13:38.774
It's not a country club
where you can

13:38.818 --> 13:40.384
just show up with a guest.

13:40.428 --> 13:43.170
The place only has 85 members,
and everyone's checked out

13:43.213 --> 13:44.954
before they get an invite.

13:44.998 --> 13:47.522
They'll sniff you out as
an outsider a mile away.

13:47.565 --> 13:49.916
- Outsider? I'm a vet.
- You a Fed.

13:52.222 --> 13:55.617
- What about Davis and Dawkins?
Do you know them very well?

13:55.660 --> 13:58.707
- Uh, a little.
They mostly kept to themselves.

13:58.750 --> 14:01.014
- Did you see them speaking
with anyone?

14:01.057 --> 14:03.755
- The only person ever I saw
them hang out with

14:03.799 --> 14:07.150
was the owner.
- You know the owner's name?

14:10.110 --> 14:11.415
- All right,
so Nick Hawthorne,

14:11.459 --> 14:13.461
owner and bartender of
The Garrison Lodge

14:13.504 --> 14:15.985
is a former
college debate champ.

14:16.029 --> 14:17.726
Army major,
spent 24 months in Iraq

14:17.769 --> 14:19.684
without ever leaving
the green zone.

14:19.728 --> 14:21.077
And most importantly,
the recipient

14:21.121 --> 14:23.166
of several phone calls from
both Dawkins and Davis

14:23.210 --> 14:24.689
in the weeks leading up
to each bombing.

14:24.733 --> 14:26.604
- Sounds like
an armchair general to me.

14:26.648 --> 14:28.084
- Well, yeah, based on
the phone calls,

14:28.128 --> 14:30.260
that might be
exactly what we're looking at.

14:30.304 --> 14:32.088
What if Hawthorne
had an axe to grind

14:32.132 --> 14:34.090
with the federal government?
You know, passed over

14:34.134 --> 14:35.875
for a promotion.
Wanted to be a general.

14:35.918 --> 14:38.616
And he's recruiting
struggling vets from his bar

14:38.660 --> 14:40.053
to do his dirty work for him.

14:40.096 --> 14:42.925
- Yeah, the only problem is
the phone calls themself

14:42.969 --> 14:44.753
aren't actually proof
of a crime.

14:44.796 --> 14:46.973
- But they're good enough
for a warrant.

14:48.496 --> 14:50.933
Let's talk to this guy.
We need information.

14:50.977 --> 14:52.195
- Yeah.

14:56.373 --> 14:58.680
- Nick Hawthorne, FBI,
we got a warrant

14:58.723 --> 15:00.725
to search the premises.

15:03.250 --> 15:05.165
- I guess you
better come inside.

15:05.208 --> 15:06.427
Mind if I ask
what this is about?

15:06.470 --> 15:08.037
- Got you on record taking
dozens of calls

15:08.081 --> 15:09.952
from Trey Dawkins
and Ryan Davis.

15:09.996 --> 15:12.215
- What happened to Davis?

15:12.259 --> 15:14.348
- He bombed
the federal courthouse.

15:14.391 --> 15:15.436
- I see.

15:16.654 --> 15:18.700
- You don't seem
that surprised.

15:18.743 --> 15:19.962
- Well, I'm not.

15:20.006 --> 15:21.355
Both those guys
were really struggling.

15:21.398 --> 15:23.705
- And they came to you
for advice?

15:23.748 --> 15:25.663
- Yeah, we're friends.

15:25.707 --> 15:26.969
Whole reason I opened the Lodge
is so guys like that

15:27.013 --> 15:29.580
would have some place to go.
- Guys like what?

15:29.624 --> 15:31.974
- Vets...who are tired
of the piss poor,

15:32.018 --> 15:34.324
patchwork help they've gotten
since coming home.

15:34.368 --> 15:37.197
Tired of the lack of respect.
And do you two

15:37.240 --> 15:39.547
have any idea how many
homeless vets there are?

15:39.590 --> 15:42.854
How many are struggling with
substance abuse and PTSD?

15:42.898 --> 15:45.509
And it's not exactly like
Jane and Johnny Libtard care.

15:45.553 --> 15:49.339
There are a lot of ex-soldiers
who are rightfully angry.

15:51.646 --> 15:53.213
- What about you?

15:53.256 --> 15:56.433
- No more so than average.

15:56.477 --> 16:00.350
Then again, I'm not starving
or having my wages garnished

16:00.394 --> 16:02.352
by the IRS like Dawkins.

16:02.396 --> 16:04.659
And I don't have
three platoon mates

16:04.702 --> 16:06.269
who are staring down
prison time for stealing

16:06.313 --> 16:08.358
opioids from the VA
after some navy doc

16:08.402 --> 16:11.013
got him hooked on that crap
in the first place.

16:11.057 --> 16:13.450
- Are you saying you condone
attacking government buildings?

16:14.886 --> 16:16.497
- Doesn't matter
what I condone.

16:16.540 --> 16:19.456
Violence is
an individual choice,

16:19.500 --> 16:21.545
but I doubt the bombings
will stop until

16:21.589 --> 16:24.896
some systemic wrongs
have been righted.

16:24.940 --> 16:26.333
- Scola.

16:28.813 --> 16:31.251
- What did we find?
- Nothing.

16:31.294 --> 16:33.905
- What do you mean nothing?
- I mean nothing.

16:33.949 --> 16:37.822
No bomb residue, no chemicals.
Not even a handgun.

16:37.866 --> 16:39.650
- What about the computer?
- Clean.

16:39.694 --> 16:41.696
Might as well be
the demo computer at Best Buy.

16:42.784 --> 16:44.916
- Okay, well check
the place one more time.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.092
I'm gonna head to the office.

16:48.224 --> 16:49.312
- Guy definitely thinks

16:49.356 --> 16:50.922
he's the smartest kid
in the class.

16:50.966 --> 16:54.317
- Yeah, well let's show him
that he's not.

16:56.406 --> 16:59.061
- I heard we came up empty
at Nick Hawthorne's.

16:59.105 --> 17:01.498
- Uh, yeah, but Tiff and Scola
both came back

17:01.542 --> 17:05.067
convinced that Hawthorne is
the brains behind the bombings.

17:05.111 --> 17:08.288
- Okay.
Good, let's, uh, chase that.

17:08.331 --> 17:09.767
- That's the plan.

17:09.811 --> 17:11.639
Yeah, we're trying to
get inside the bar.

17:14.120 --> 17:19.081
- Look, Isobel,
I'm a--I'm not trying to--

17:19.125 --> 17:21.257
I'm not playing games here.

17:21.301 --> 17:23.303
Okay? What's good for me
is good for you.

17:23.346 --> 17:25.261
We're a team.

17:25.305 --> 17:27.176
- Well, I appreciate that.

17:28.786 --> 17:31.006
- But do you believe it?

17:32.007 --> 17:33.661
- OA--

17:33.704 --> 17:36.185
- You wanted to see me?
-Yes, please. Have a seat.

17:37.621 --> 17:40.798
We need to get eyes and ears
inside the Lodge.

17:40.842 --> 17:42.800
- I agree, but according to ATF

17:42.844 --> 17:44.280
that's almost impossible,
right?

17:44.324 --> 17:48.197
- Which is why we need to
use your friend, Chris Zapata.

17:53.028 --> 17:54.899
- Using Chris
isn't a good idea.

17:54.943 --> 17:58.642
- He is our only option.
- I understand that, Isobel,

17:58.686 --> 18:01.732
but the thing about Chris
is that he is--

18:01.776 --> 18:04.561
Struggling.
Readjusting to civilian life,

18:04.605 --> 18:06.694
if you know what I mean.

18:12.830 --> 18:17.618
- I get it, OA, I do,
but we need him.

18:18.923 --> 18:22.188
Okay?
If he chooses to cooperate,

18:22.231 --> 18:23.667
I will do everything I can

18:23.711 --> 18:25.582
to get his weapons charge
dismissed.

18:25.626 --> 18:26.757
- If he cooperates?

18:26.801 --> 18:28.716
He already has
given us information.

18:28.759 --> 18:30.587
He has already cooperated.

18:32.459 --> 18:34.243
He's already helped us.

18:34.287 --> 18:35.375
That should be enough
to drop the charges.

18:35.418 --> 18:37.203
- It's not enough.

18:37.246 --> 18:41.163
It might reduce the charges
or lessen the sentence,

18:41.207 --> 18:42.686
but the US Attorney's
Office isn't

18:42.730 --> 18:45.254
just gonna dismiss this case.

18:45.298 --> 18:49.302
OA, if he is struggling,
spending time in prison--

18:49.345 --> 18:53.001
any time in prison--is only
going to make things worse.

18:55.917 --> 18:57.745
This is a win-win.

19:01.140 --> 19:05.579
- Then I will, uh, try
and sell it to him.

19:15.066 --> 19:18.069
- Wasn't expecting
you two so soon.

19:18.113 --> 19:19.723
If I knew you guys were coming

19:19.767 --> 19:22.117
I would've thrown away
the pizza boxes.

19:23.640 --> 19:25.686
- We've been looking into
Nick Hawthorne

19:25.729 --> 19:27.992
based on what you told us about
Dawkins and Davis.

19:28.036 --> 19:30.125
We think that he's been
taking advantage of them.

19:31.257 --> 19:32.736
- How?
- Well by feeding

19:32.780 --> 19:34.564
into their anger and
then sending them on patriotic

19:34.608 --> 19:36.479
missions to strike against
places where vets

19:36.523 --> 19:38.568
have been mistreated.
But we cannot be certain

19:38.612 --> 19:40.831
of that until we get
somebody inside the Lodge.

19:40.875 --> 19:45.227
- No, no. I'm not a snitch,
and the Lodge is the only place

19:45.271 --> 19:46.750
in this country
I feel at home right now.

19:46.794 --> 19:49.927
And Hawthorne's a good guy.
- Mm.

19:51.102 --> 19:52.626
Show him the picture.

19:54.758 --> 19:56.499
- We've not released that
to the public yet,

19:56.543 --> 19:57.979
but one of the victims
was at the courthouse

19:58.022 --> 20:00.242
was a little kid on his way
to the lobby daycare.

20:00.286 --> 20:03.593
Davis put a bomb into
his backpack--

20:03.637 --> 20:05.639
we believe because
Hawthorne ordered it.

20:05.682 --> 20:08.511
And good guys do not
hurt kids right, Chris?

20:10.774 --> 20:13.777
- Yeah, OA told me
the story on the way over here.

20:13.821 --> 20:16.432
Said that one time in Mosul
you charged into

20:16.476 --> 20:19.827
a burning school bus filled
with kids before it exploded.

20:21.045 --> 20:23.657
- Wasn't their fault
the neighbors were insurgents.

20:27.965 --> 20:30.881
Hawthorne did this?
- Mm-hmm.

20:30.925 --> 20:32.448
- Okay, look, I know
he's trying to help vets,

20:32.492 --> 20:35.059
but this is not the right way
to do it.

20:40.326 --> 20:41.849
- All right, I'm in.

20:45.505 --> 20:47.681
Tell me what I need to do.

20:59.519 --> 21:00.824
- You ready?

21:00.868 --> 21:03.349
- Come on, bro.
I think I can handle a recon.

21:04.350 --> 21:06.917
- All right.
This is your earpiece.

21:06.961 --> 21:08.441
I'm gonna be in your ear
the whole time.

21:08.484 --> 21:12.271
All right?
This is a button cam.

21:12.314 --> 21:13.881
We'll be able to see
everything you can see.

21:13.924 --> 21:15.535
- Okay.

21:15.578 --> 21:18.886
- Now why don't you explain
to me the layout of this place?

21:18.929 --> 21:21.715
- All right, bar in the front.
There's a hallway

21:21.758 --> 21:24.108
that leads to the latrine
and kitchen in the back.

21:24.152 --> 21:25.849
- Simple.

21:25.893 --> 21:27.721
This is magnetic.
Your job is to stick it

21:27.764 --> 21:29.505
anywhere in the bar so that
we can hear and see

21:29.549 --> 21:31.246
whoever Hawthorne
is grooming next.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.074
- Got it.

21:36.120 --> 21:39.733
- What's that, Chris? Huh?
What is this?

21:39.776 --> 21:42.562
- Dude, dude, I told you, this
is a place where people carry.

21:42.605 --> 21:44.390
- No, that is all
the more reason why you cannot

21:44.433 --> 21:46.740
take a Glock in there,
you understand?

21:46.783 --> 21:50.396
This is police work, not war.
Okay?

21:52.398 --> 21:54.356
Your mission is to go in there
and have a drink,
