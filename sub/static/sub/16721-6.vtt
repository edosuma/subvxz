[theme music playing]

01:24.210 --> 01:26.087
[Trish] <i>If you're just joining us,</i>
<i>this is</i> Trish Talk

01:26.170 --> 01:27.797
<i>and we are discussing the recent events</i>

01:27.881 --> 01:30.216
<i>that have the residents</i>
<i>of Harlem confused,</i>

01:30.299 --> 01:32.010
<i>and some even frightened.</i>

01:32.093 --> 01:34.345
<i>Line one. Sophia, you're on the air.</i>

01:34.428 --> 01:36.973
[Sophia] <i>Luke Cage is turning</i>
<i>the neighborhood upside down</i>

01:37.056 --> 01:38.266
<i>and giving it a good shake.</i>

01:38.349 --> 01:40.101
<i>Trust me, no one wants to see</i>
<i>what falls out.</i>

01:40.184 --> 01:43.146
[Trish] <i>Are you suggesting we turn</i>
<i>a blind eye to the problems in our city?</i>

01:43.229 --> 01:44.480
[Sophia] <i>No, but I seen the news.</i>

01:44.563 --> 01:47.025
<i>The man is so strong,</i>
<i>he doesn't have to answer to anybody.</i>

01:47.108 --> 01:48.818
<i>Can you trust a person like that?</i>

01:48.902 --> 01:51.320
<i>Let the police do their jobs.</i>
<i>That's what I say.</i>

01:51.404 --> 01:52.656
[Trish] <i>Some would argue the boys in blue</i>

01:52.739 --> 01:55.324
<i>don't exactly have</i>
<i>a sterling reputation these days.</i>

01:55.408 --> 01:56.534
[Sophia] <i>Oh, yeah, missy?</i>

01:56.618 --> 01:58.912
<i>Well, the next time trouble comes</i>
<i>banging at your door,</i>

01:58.995 --> 02:01.414
<i>maybe you should call Luke Cage</i>
<i>instead of 911.</i>

02:01.497 --> 02:03.541
[Trish chuckles] <i>You know what, Sophia?</i>
<i>I just might.</i>

02:03.625 --> 02:05.459
<i>Uh, let's take another caller.</i>

02:05.543 --> 02:06.920
<i>Line two. Hi, Amir.</i>

02:07.003 --> 02:08.420
[Amir] <i>Hey, Trish,</i>
<i>I want to respond to that lady</i>

02:08.503 --> 02:09.756
<i>'cause she's got it all wrong.</i>

02:09.839 --> 02:11.716
<i>I know Luke. He comes into the fish fry.</i>

02:11.800 --> 02:13.802
<i>Always treats my wife and me with respect.</i>

02:13.885 --> 02:15.679
<i>Last week, two kids started a fight,</i>

02:15.762 --> 02:17.471
<i>Luke took care of it</i>
<i>and nobody got hurt.</i>

02:17.555 --> 02:21.434
[Trish] <i>I think it's noteworthy that the</i>
<i>only people I've spoken to that criticize</i>

02:21.517 --> 02:23.477
<i>are the ones</i>
<i>who don't know him personally.</i>

02:23.561 --> 02:25.313
<i>So many others</i>
<i>have merely read about him</i>

02:25.396 --> 02:27.774
<i>or saw him on the news</i>
<i>and jumped to conclusions.</i>

02:27.857 --> 02:30.944
[Amir] <i>Trish, Luke is good people</i>
<i>and he belongs right here in Harlem.</i>

02:31.027 --> 02:33.446
<i>And I think it's important for all of us</i>
<i>to realize something.</i>

02:33.529 --> 02:37.200
<i>We are witnessing a massive shift</i>
<i>in the boundaries of possibility.</i>

02:37.283 --> 02:40.619
<i>But what is scary to some</i>
<i>inspires hope in others.</i>

02:40.704 --> 02:44.833
<i>I, for one, would like to thank Luke Cage</i>
<i>for all the work he's doing in Harlem.</i>

02:44.916 --> 02:47.961
<i>Those of us below 110th</i>
<i>see the good work he's doing</i>

02:48.044 --> 02:49.628
<i>and we hope he's doing well.</i>

03:07.772 --> 03:10.399
I never thought I'd be happy
to see your ugly face.

03:11.400 --> 03:14.028
Well, we all can't be as pretty as you.

03:14.112 --> 03:16.322
[laughs] Ain't that the truth.

03:16.405 --> 03:17.782
You got the goods?

03:17.866 --> 03:20.284
You know me. I always come correct.

03:20.368 --> 03:22.286
It's all piled up in there,
just waiting for you.

03:23.704 --> 03:26.833
- So we're squared up?
- Mmm, nah. We ain't square.

03:26.916 --> 03:29.335
We a few zeroes off.

03:30.503 --> 03:32.797
About $100,000 worth.

03:34.423 --> 03:35.466
[clicks tongue]

03:36.384 --> 03:38.511
I'm not givin' you another dime.

03:38.594 --> 03:41.472
Good. I don't need another dime.
I need $100,000.

03:42.515 --> 03:45.769
No cash, no guns. No guns, no Domingo.

03:46.477 --> 03:48.187
The ghetto CNN is workin' overtime.

03:48.271 --> 03:50.064
If you don't make it straight
with Domingo, you're done.

03:50.148 --> 03:54.360
Plus... I got all your cash in lockup.
Oops.

03:57.238 --> 04:00.909
Think about how you want to spend
the rest of your life, Detective.

04:01.617 --> 04:03.536
[snorts and laughs] Shit!

04:08.457 --> 04:12.670
Man, your juice is water since Luke Cage
punked your peacock ass.

04:16.132 --> 04:17.382
[grunts]

04:20.887 --> 04:23.389
[both straining]

04:29.520 --> 04:30.855
[groaning]

04:36.444 --> 04:37.779
[laughing]

04:37.862 --> 04:39.322
[grunts]

04:39.405 --> 04:40.824
[Stokes laughing]

04:40.907 --> 04:43.827
[breathing heavily] You shot a cop!

04:43.910 --> 04:46.204
[man] Hey, what's goin' on over there?

04:46.287 --> 04:49.123
Hey, man, you all right?

04:49.207 --> 04:52.043
[Stokes] When I catch you,
I'm gonna use my hands, bitch.

04:53.086 --> 04:54.170
[engine starting]

04:56.798 --> 04:58.507
[breathing heavily]

05:00.009 --> 05:01.594
[man] Hey! Hey!

05:02.553 --> 05:03.805
[grunts]

05:04.889 --> 05:06.224
[Mariah] <i>I believe in Harlem.</i>

05:06.307 --> 05:12.063
You know, my Harlem is saturated
with jazz, and good food,

05:12.146 --> 05:15.774
and the pure genius
that permeates the streets.

05:17.485 --> 05:21.197
Harlem is risin'
like a phoenix out of the ashes.

05:21.280 --> 05:25.534
I mean, that's what
all of my various complexes is about,

05:25.618 --> 05:27.786
is restoring that luster.

05:27.871 --> 05:29.205
Fantastic.

05:29.288 --> 05:31.290
Uh, you mind if we go in now,
Madam Councilwoman?

05:31.374 --> 05:32.583
The crew needs to set up for later.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.543
Yeah, of course, of course. Go on.

05:35.628 --> 05:38.047
- [sighs]
- Your new VH1 show?

05:38.131 --> 05:39.757
<i>Criminal Spinsters?</i>

05:40.884 --> 05:42.843
Who you callin' a spinster?

05:42.927 --> 05:45.138
I'd wear your narrow ass out.

05:46.639 --> 05:48.307
What's this about?

05:48.391 --> 05:51.477
Your cousin. I'm shutting him down.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.312
You, too.

05:54.647 --> 05:56.524
Are you threatening me?

05:56.607 --> 05:57.984
Never that.

06:07.160 --> 06:09.370
Ah! Come on. Let's go inside.

06:12.123 --> 06:15.543
- I ain't no barber, Bobby.
- [Fish] Neither am I, Luke.

06:16.460 --> 06:20.464
But we both agree that Harlem
is a better place with the shop open.

06:21.382 --> 06:25.094
As soon as I put Cottonmouth in handcuffs,
I'm ghost.

06:25.844 --> 06:28.264
You could make a career
out of robbing bad guys.

06:28.347 --> 06:29.974
- [chuckles]
- Huh!

06:30.058 --> 06:32.435
That would be the perfect grind,
wouldn't it?

06:32.518 --> 06:34.312
You ever think about
playing for the Giants?

06:34.395 --> 06:36.314
[scoffs] You could make that squad easy.

06:36.397 --> 06:39.358
[chuckles] Being hood famous
is bad enough.

06:39.442 --> 06:41.569
I couldn't be in the public eye
on that kind of level.

06:41.652 --> 06:42.946
Nah, man.

06:45.031 --> 06:46.157
Wear a mask.

06:47.450 --> 06:48.576
What for?

06:51.996 --> 06:53.914
I ain't no hero.

06:53.998 --> 06:55.666
That's a great slogan.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.669
"I ain't no hero. Pay me."

06:58.752 --> 07:00.713
[scoffs] You could market that shit.

07:01.589 --> 07:02.966
[chuckling]

07:07.761 --> 07:10.556
[Mariah] What do you mean
you shot him, Cornell?

07:10.639 --> 07:13.892
Cornell! How could you be so stupid?

07:14.852 --> 07:16.437
You didn't have to shoot him.

07:18.314 --> 07:20.691
And just let him stick me
for a hundred large?

07:21.985 --> 07:23.069
Hell no.

07:24.153 --> 07:25.904
It wasn't like
I went to the meeting strapped.

07:25.989 --> 07:27.656
It was his gun that busted off.

07:27.740 --> 07:31.327
But you went there alone
because you knew you were wrong.

07:32.370 --> 07:34.872
[scoffs] This is insane.

07:34.956 --> 07:36.540
If he lives,

07:36.624 --> 07:40.419
everything that you have built
will come crashing down.

07:41.045 --> 07:43.965
And you are not dragging me down with you.
You hearin' me?

07:44.048 --> 07:46.384
My guys are pickin' up the guns right now.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.512
We'll hand them over to Domingo tonight.

07:49.595 --> 07:52.848
I don't want the details.
I just want results.

07:52.931 --> 07:55.059
You want results?

07:55.143 --> 07:56.602
I don't work for you.

07:58.271 --> 08:00.939
Okay, forget the cops.
The cops are bad enough.

08:01.732 --> 08:04.860
- What about Luke Cage?
- Isn't your interview today?

08:05.569 --> 08:07.738
That's where your focus should be.

08:07.821 --> 08:11.117
Givin' off that Geoffrey Canada vibe,
for real.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.368
That's where the money is.

08:12.451 --> 08:15.038
Oh, forget the money, Cornell.

08:15.121 --> 08:17.331
Forget the club. Sell it!

08:18.582 --> 08:20.584
Walk away from all this shit.

08:22.753 --> 08:26.257
People are still talking about
how tall you stood at Pop's memorial.

08:31.595 --> 08:33.264
I'm proud of you, cousin.

08:34.390 --> 08:36.017
- [sighs]
- I really am.

08:38.519 --> 08:40.563
But I can take care of myself.

08:47.195 --> 08:48.946
You need to take his ass out.

08:50.781 --> 08:52.366
It ain't that easy.

08:53.576 --> 08:57.080
Cage is bulletproof.
I've seen it myself. It's real.

08:58.831 --> 09:00.624
Does the nigga have gills?

09:01.459 --> 09:02.960
Excuse me?

09:03.669 --> 09:05.003
Drown him.

09:07.548 --> 09:08.966
Can he burn?

09:11.510 --> 09:13.221
Can you poison him?

09:18.684 --> 09:20.686
What about a woman?

09:21.395 --> 09:24.690
You know he got one with his fine ass.

09:24.773 --> 09:28.694
You find his weakness and you squeeze.

09:31.864 --> 09:34.200
You soundin' a lot like Mama Mabel.

09:37.328 --> 09:39.205
Don't worry about Cage.

09:39.288 --> 09:41.665
His days are numbered.
I got something for him.

09:42.500 --> 09:43.834
That's my word.

09:50.216 --> 09:51.550
[cell phone ringing]

09:54.387 --> 09:55.846
<i>¿Qué pasó?</i>

09:55.929 --> 09:58.641
People, uh, are scrambling around here.

09:58.724 --> 10:02.436
My niggas loaded up the stash
right before the cops arrived.

10:02.520 --> 10:04.105
[Perez] <i>What the hell happened?</i>

10:04.188 --> 10:05.356
[exhales]

10:06.274 --> 10:11.112
Detective Scarfe
tried to squeeze me for 100 grand.

10:12.905 --> 10:14.072
You put him up to that shit?

10:14.157 --> 10:16.367
Hell no. Of course not.

10:16.450 --> 10:18.411
Let me, uh, let me speak to him.
Where's he at?

10:18.494 --> 10:21.747
Bleedin'... and in the wind.

10:21.830 --> 10:23.541
<i>You know what you just did, right?</i>

10:24.667 --> 10:26.460
<i>There's no easy way out of this, man.</i>

10:27.628 --> 10:29.422
Why do you think we're talking?

10:37.763 --> 10:39.848
This is why you need to learn how to text.

10:39.932 --> 10:41.892
You always think the worst.

10:42.851 --> 10:46.189
- What do you need, <i>Mami?</i>
- Not me, you.

11:04.039 --> 11:05.374
Luke?

11:07.710 --> 11:08.794
Yes?

11:09.712 --> 11:12.340
Oh. You probably
don't remember me, do you?

11:13.257 --> 11:16.885
Your girlfriend had me take care of you
when you were brought into the hospital?

11:18.178 --> 11:19.472
In Hell's Kitchen?

11:21.849 --> 11:22.933
Hey.

11:23.892 --> 11:24.977
[chuckles]

11:26.395 --> 11:27.688
Hey. [chuckles]

11:28.606 --> 11:30.774
Bobby. Bobby Fish.

11:30.858 --> 11:33.736
I'm sorry. Claire.
Very nice to meet you.

11:33.819 --> 11:35.946
[Fish] Well, Claire, you...

11:36.029 --> 11:40.784
you are far too beautiful
to ever apologize for anything.

11:41.702 --> 11:43.036
You remember that.

11:47.750 --> 11:49.918
- May I?
- Please. [clears throat]

11:53.922 --> 11:56.091
[both sigh]

12:03.849 --> 12:06.852
You didn't have to do
what you did for me.

12:08.646 --> 12:10.439
Have you ever saved anyone's life before?

12:13.442 --> 12:14.943
More than once I'm betting.

12:16.362 --> 12:17.863
So?

12:17.946 --> 12:21.659
So, the only thing you can think about
afterwards is if they're okay.

12:21.742 --> 12:23.243
That's all I wanted to know.

12:26.038 --> 12:27.790
[inhales deeply]

12:29.500 --> 12:30.709
Well...

12:31.835 --> 12:33.671
I'm still here.

12:33.754 --> 12:35.047
How?

12:36.173 --> 12:40.260
That shotgun blast alone
should've turned your brain into mush.

12:43.972 --> 12:45.308
So I'm a freak.

12:46.767 --> 12:49.562
No. You're amazing.

12:56.234 --> 12:59.947
I don't wanna be different
than anybody else.

13:00.030 --> 13:01.449
Why hide it?

13:02.282 --> 13:04.493
I mean, what are you gonna do with it?

13:07.245 --> 13:08.456
[sighs]

13:11.625 --> 13:12.710
[exhales]

13:16.339 --> 13:17.715
I gotta go.

13:33.188 --> 13:34.982
- Text me later.
- Okay.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.614
[indistinct chatter]

13:43.824 --> 13:44.950
Listen up!

13:46.243 --> 13:48.120
I'm hearin' a lot of whispers and rumors

13:48.203 --> 13:50.914
concerning Detective Scarfe
and what he might've been into.

13:51.832 --> 13:53.542
Kill that noise.

13:53.626 --> 13:55.753
We need him back alive.

13:57.212 --> 13:59.256
There was a trail of his blood
at the scene.

13:59.339 --> 14:02.510
His car riddled with bullets.
We don't know what the hell happened.

14:02.593 --> 14:03.969
Focus on that.

14:04.887 --> 14:07.139
I'm putting out an APB.

14:07.222 --> 14:09.767
We're closing streets, tunnels,
puttin' up road blocks.

14:09.850 --> 14:12.770
Whatever it takes.
But remember something.

14:12.853 --> 14:16.482
This belongs in our shop. No one else's.

14:18.609 --> 14:22.029
Now, there's already too many
new faces here, far as I'm concerned.

14:22.112 --> 14:24.322
And there're only gonna be more.

14:24.407 --> 14:26.992
We need to be the ones to bring him home.

14:28.702 --> 14:29.995
Let's do it.

14:34.249 --> 14:36.419
How, uh... how you holdin' up?

14:36.502 --> 14:40.381
I'd be doin' a lot better if people would
stop starin' at me like I'm dirty.

14:40.464 --> 14:43.133
What do you know, Detective?
Scarfe must have told you something.

14:43.216 --> 14:44.552
There's evidence that guns

14:44.635 --> 14:46.679
from the junkyard shoot-out
were in that warehouse.

14:46.762 --> 14:48.806
Stolen from our evidence locker?

14:48.889 --> 14:51.141
Your partner is my top suspect.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.310
It doesn't mean Scarfe did it.

14:53.394 --> 14:56.063
He probably got a lead,
and went to go and check it out.

14:56.146 --> 14:59.316
Alone.
Without pulling you in on a single detail.

15:00.317 --> 15:01.944
Are you sure you don't know
where to find him?

15:02.027 --> 15:03.946
If I knew, I would tell you.

15:05.197 --> 15:07.240
So is that how we're
playing this, Captain?

15:07.324 --> 15:09.242
Like Scarfe is a suspect
and not a victim?

15:09.326 --> 15:11.328
He could be both or either.

15:11.412 --> 15:13.288
We won't know
until you guys bring him in.

15:13.371 --> 15:14.457
Us?

15:14.540 --> 15:17.668
I need my best on this, Detective.
That was you and Scarfe.

15:17.751 --> 15:21.338
Now I need you and Perez
to find our boy.

15:23.757 --> 15:25.217
Yes, ma'am.

15:29.387 --> 15:31.306
[sighs]

15:31.389 --> 15:33.058
[Luke] <i>You can disappear.</i>

15:33.141 --> 15:37.104
The whole point of livin' in New York,
no one cares about anybody.

15:38.439 --> 15:41.567
A building fell on you.
People are shooting at you.

15:41.650 --> 15:45.488
And you walk around without a scratch.
Who's gonna ignore all that?

15:50.158 --> 15:51.619
What's wrong?

15:51.702 --> 15:53.161
It's supposed to be locked.

15:54.079 --> 15:56.749
Bobby? Are you in here, man?

16:00.210 --> 16:01.419
[door closes]

16:04.798 --> 16:07.009
[breathing heavily]

16:07.092 --> 16:09.762
- Scarfe?
- No cops.

16:10.679 --> 16:13.140
- Not even Misty.
- Why me?

16:13.223 --> 16:15.267
'Cause you don't trust us.

16:17.019 --> 16:18.353
We need to get him to a hospital.

16:18.436 --> 16:20.939
No, I can't go to the hospital.
They'll kill me.

16:21.023 --> 16:23.817
[breathing heavily]
Just like they did Chico.

16:23.901 --> 16:27.070
They found him, they'll find me.

16:28.405 --> 16:29.823
[Claire] He's lost a lot of blood.

16:30.741 --> 16:32.660
Help me get him into the chair. Now.

16:37.581 --> 16:38.916
[Scarfe grunts]

16:42.836 --> 16:44.337
Just right here, thank you.

16:44.421 --> 16:47.382
Bobby just bought these chairs.
He's gonna be pissed.

17:31.468 --> 17:33.136
[Perez] You are a weirdo.

17:34.638 --> 17:38.308
People at the precinct talk about you
like you are <i>curandera</i> or some shit.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.143
Like you see things. [chuckles]

17:42.312 --> 17:44.189
You remember <i>Where's Waldo?</i>

17:45.566 --> 17:46.734
That was me as a kid.

17:46.817 --> 17:48.819
And I could find Waldo
faster than anybody.

17:48.902 --> 17:50.153
[camera shutter clicking]

17:50.237 --> 17:52.114
That's what a photograph does for me.

17:53.031 --> 17:55.242
A photograph freezes time.

17:55.325 --> 17:58.954
It allows you to look at things,
slow down,

17:59.037 --> 18:01.915
think about what's out of place,
and then fill in the blanks.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.668
That's how you find Waldo.

18:05.836 --> 18:09.923
Maybe you should work for Kodak.
That was deep. [chuckles]

18:10.007 --> 18:11.424
[Misty] Whatever.

18:13.135 --> 18:16.388
- His clothes are still here, right?
- Yeah.

18:16.471 --> 18:19.808
So, if he wasn't taken,
there's a chance he might come back.

18:19.892 --> 18:22.227
We should stake it out for a while.

18:22.310 --> 18:25.480
Never would have thought
Scarfe would be cute as a kid.

18:25.563 --> 18:28.233
That's not Scarfe. That's his son, Earl.

18:29.151 --> 18:30.861
Never knew he had a kid.

18:30.944 --> 18:32.154
Earl's dead.

18:35.448 --> 18:38.118
Scarfe forgot to lock up
his gun one night.

18:38.201 --> 18:40.704
Earl found it
and accidentally shot himself.

18:42.539 --> 18:46.293
Scarfe cracks a lot of jokes,
but he rarely smiles.

18:46.376 --> 18:47.961
There's a difference.

18:50.631 --> 18:51.965
[clears throat]

18:55.135 --> 18:56.553
[gasps]

18:56.637 --> 18:58.138
- [picture frame clatters]
- Oh!

19:01.433 --> 19:02.685
Shut it!

19:04.728 --> 19:06.313
Dusty old bitch.

19:10.901 --> 19:12.110
[sighs]

19:15.530 --> 19:16.990
[Claire] Okay.

19:18.116 --> 19:20.452
I can remove the bullet from his thigh...

19:20.535 --> 19:22.871
but the shot in his side is worse.

19:22.955 --> 19:25.999
If the bullet pierced his liver,
he's gonna have internal bleeding,

19:26.083 --> 19:29.211
- and I can't do anything about that here.
- [sighs]

19:29.294 --> 19:30.378
[groaning]

19:30.462 --> 19:33.131
Give me one good reason
I shouldn't dump you at the 29th.

19:34.132 --> 19:35.926
[breathing heavily] I told you, man.

19:37.219 --> 19:39.554
They're trying to kill me.

19:39.637 --> 19:41.181
[sighs]

19:41.264 --> 19:44.184
- No, no, no. Don't... move.
- [grunting]

19:44.267 --> 19:46.144
Don't get up. Stay right here. Hold.

19:46.228 --> 19:47.562
[groaning]

19:50.941 --> 19:52.735
Who the hell is this?

19:52.818 --> 19:54.987
I'm the woman trying to save your life.

19:55.070 --> 19:56.864
Thank you. Whatever.

19:56.947 --> 19:58.198
[groans]

19:59.574 --> 20:01.118
[sighs]

20:03.286 --> 20:05.205
Well, this is gonna sting a lot.

20:05.288 --> 20:07.249
[breathing heavily]

20:13.714 --> 20:16.174
Ah! God!

20:16.258 --> 20:17.467
[whimpering]

20:18.385 --> 20:19.720
[groaning]

20:21.554 --> 20:25.142
I think I'm gonna have to stay,
lay low here for a little while.

20:25.225 --> 20:26.559
No.

20:26.643 --> 20:29.521
- Not until you tell me what's goin' on.
- I can't tell you anything right now.

20:29.604 --> 20:30.939
[groaning]

20:39.531 --> 20:41.324
[panting]

20:45.162 --> 20:46.997
Okay.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.373
It was Cottonmouth.

20:50.500 --> 20:51.877
He was behind everything.

20:51.960 --> 20:53.879
So you've been working for him
the whole time?

20:53.962 --> 20:55.297
Yeah.

20:55.380 --> 20:56.506
[breathing heavily]

20:56.589 --> 20:59.968
I got his guns out of lockup for him,

21:00.928 --> 21:03.263
and then he turns around
and tries to kill me.

21:03.346 --> 21:05.015
Go figure.

21:05.098 --> 21:07.434
What makes you think I can protect you?

21:07.517 --> 21:09.311
[breathing heavily]

21:09.394 --> 21:14.191
You survived a drive-by
and a building fallin' on your head.

21:14.274 --> 21:17.402
[grunting] I'd say you're overqualified.

21:17.485 --> 21:19.905
You mentioned Chico before you passed out.

21:21.364 --> 21:23.366
What happened to Chico?

21:23.450 --> 21:25.493
I told you.

21:26.744 --> 21:28.538
They killed him.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.207
Don't lie to me.

21:31.291 --> 21:32.500
Not now.

21:33.836 --> 21:34.837
[Scarfe grunts]

21:37.630 --> 21:38.924
[softly] Okay.

21:43.887 --> 21:45.806
[sighs]

21:45.889 --> 21:47.307
I killed him.

22:04.741 --> 22:06.118
[straining]

22:09.662 --> 22:10.956
[Claire] Luke.

22:11.789 --> 22:13.208
[Scarfe gasps]

22:13.291 --> 22:15.293
Don't. Please.

22:18.255 --> 22:19.506
[Scarfe choking]

22:19.589 --> 22:21.508
[Claire] You're not a killer.

22:21.591 --> 22:23.051
Are you?

22:25.262 --> 22:26.846
[Scarfe gagging]

22:32.227 --> 22:33.770
[coughing]

22:39.026 --> 22:40.402
We're done.

22:41.444 --> 22:43.030
- Let's go.
- [panting]

22:44.031 --> 22:45.908
Hey, Cage!

22:46.909 --> 22:48.201
[gasps]

22:49.869 --> 22:50.996
Cage!

22:52.289 --> 22:53.331
Wait!

22:54.124 --> 22:56.834
I'm an asshole!
There's no disputing that.

22:56.919 --> 23:00.213
I am a despicable human being.

23:03.425 --> 23:07.429
But Cottonmouth is a hell of a lot worse!

23:08.513 --> 23:13.143
And I have got what it takes
to put him behind bars

23:13.226 --> 23:15.270
for the rest of his life!

23:19.191 --> 23:21.068
- [Luke] What did you say?
- [sighs]

23:23.486 --> 23:25.238
I can take him down.

23:39.962 --> 23:41.088
What do you have?

23:41.171 --> 23:43.048
[breathing heavily]

23:43.131 --> 23:44.299
Notes.

23:46.468 --> 23:48.803
Detailed notes...

23:48.886 --> 23:52.515
of murder investigations I covered up
to save his ass.

23:54.226 --> 24:00.648
How he uses Spurlock's Mortuary...
to dispose of the bodies.

24:03.026 --> 24:04.902
Why do you think you never found Tone?

24:05.862 --> 24:07.155
Or Chico?

24:10.367 --> 24:12.119
Plus...

24:12.202 --> 24:16.789
I've got the name of every cop
on Cottonmouth's payroll.

24:17.749 --> 24:19.334
[sighs]

24:19.417 --> 24:23.838
That ought to be plenty to send him
on a nice permanent trip.

24:23.921 --> 24:25.215
[exhales]

24:26.133 --> 24:27.884
- Where are these notes?
- [sighs]

24:28.801 --> 24:30.262
Tell me.

24:31.221 --> 24:32.264
Now.

24:33.181 --> 24:34.391
[sighs]

24:36.476 --> 24:37.935
My apartment.

24:56.913 --> 24:59.999
- Alex, no one goes in the back.
- Mmm-hmm.

25:00.083 --> 25:02.044
And make sure these people
don't scuff up my floors.

25:02.127 --> 25:04.421
They will stay immaculate,
Madam Councilwoman.

25:04.504 --> 25:08.841
So, since this will be a live interview,
we'll try to keep things spontaneous.

25:08.925 --> 25:11.136
But are there any topics
you want to focus on?

25:11.219 --> 25:14.514
Well, Harlem.
How to shape it, how to elevate it, and...

25:14.597 --> 25:16.391
- how my complexes will help...
- [sighing] Boring.

25:16.474 --> 25:20.270
We've heard that speech from you
a million times and a half.

25:20.353 --> 25:22.480
I told you I do not want a fluff piece.

25:22.564 --> 25:25.608
Not fluff, fun. There's a difference.

25:25.692 --> 25:27.985
Remember when Obama sang Al Green?

25:29.028 --> 25:31.198
You wanna watch me
whip and nae nae, Thembi?

25:50.007 --> 25:51.509
You're a popular man.

25:52.427 --> 25:55.138
Oh, uh... the ex-wife.

25:55.222 --> 25:58.391
Took all my money
and she still needs the dick.

26:00.768 --> 26:02.354
Glad to see chivalry isn't dead.

26:02.437 --> 26:03.855
[Perez sighs]

26:04.814 --> 26:06.608
Look, look, look, Scarfe's not comin'.

26:06.691 --> 26:08.776
He's not gonna show up
just to get arrested.

26:08.860 --> 26:10.153
- [brakes screeching]
- [cars crashing]

26:11.363 --> 26:14.407
- [chuckles] Look at these two.
- [man and woman arguing indistinctly]

26:14.491 --> 26:17.369
- I think she's about to...
- [laughs] She's gonna knock him out.

26:18.286 --> 26:20.037
Maybe you should go arrest them.

26:20.122 --> 26:21.414
[laughs]

26:22.374 --> 26:24.167
[arguing continues]

27:04.332 --> 27:06.251
[lock breaking]

27:11.881 --> 27:15.009
I don't know if you remember me
ten years ago,

27:15.092 --> 27:17.595
when I first got bumped up off patrol?

27:17.679 --> 27:19.181
Yeah.

27:19.264 --> 27:21.891
It didn't seem like you belonged.
No offense.

27:21.974 --> 27:24.186
Mmm. None taken.

27:26.020 --> 27:29.899
A lot of people wrote me off back then.
But not Scarfe.

27:31.067 --> 27:34.987
He took me under his wing.
He taught me how to police for real.

27:37.073 --> 27:39.326
I have no idea
what he saw in me back then,

27:39.409 --> 27:42.829
but he has had my front and my back.

27:46.833 --> 27:49.252
[floorboards creaking]

28:07.229 --> 28:09.939
If he's clean or not...

28:10.022 --> 28:13.360
I wanna be the one to bring him in,
ask him his side of the story.

28:14.611 --> 28:16.153
I owe him that much.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.410
[sighs]

28:32.254 --> 28:34.171
We're wasting our time.

28:35.632 --> 28:36.924
Let's go.

28:44.056 --> 28:45.225
Somebody's in there.

28:45.308 --> 28:49.020
- No... no way Scarfe got past us.
- Well, somebody did.

29:05.995 --> 29:07.038
[dog barking]

29:10.708 --> 29:12.794
[dog barking]

29:30.312 --> 29:31.729
[Misty] Hey!

29:34.023 --> 29:35.107
Hey!

29:47.954 --> 29:49.163
[exhales]

29:49.246 --> 29:51.333
Hey, hey, hey, don't fall asleep, okay?

29:51.416 --> 29:52.584
[grunts]

29:52.667 --> 29:54.544
You need to stay conscious.
We're gonna move soon.

29:54.627 --> 29:56.128
- [footsteps approaching]
- [door opens]

30:00.758 --> 30:03.177
- [Claire sighs]
- The cops just saw me at Scarfe's place.

30:03.260 --> 30:05.680
- They'll be headed here any minute.
- Misty?

30:06.263 --> 30:08.933
Yeah... it was her.

30:09.016 --> 30:10.352
He can't really walk.

30:11.268 --> 30:13.980
- I'll carry him.
- Where?

30:14.063 --> 30:16.483
The only place this evidence
makes a difference.

30:16.566 --> 30:19.193
I just need to get a car.
I'll try and grab a cab.

30:19.276 --> 30:20.778
No, no, no, I have a better idea.

30:21.696 --> 30:24.491
- Claire...
<i>- Mami, ¿cómo estás?</i>

30:25.408 --> 30:27.118
I texted you. Did you get it?

30:27.201 --> 30:28.745
Our ride's here.

30:29.662 --> 30:32.123
Yeah. No, no, no,
just come around the back.

30:33.207 --> 30:34.459
[groans]

30:35.960 --> 30:38.087
- [car honking]
- No. Around the back.

30:38.170 --> 30:39.547
Okay.

30:39.631 --> 30:40.882
[groans]

30:40.965 --> 30:42.258
[panting]

30:43.217 --> 30:44.552
[groaning]

30:45.470 --> 30:47.472
[Claire] Here's our ride.

30:47.555 --> 30:50.433
- [Luke] You gotta be kidding me.
- [Scarfe continues groaning]

30:52.018 --> 30:53.978
Oh! Careful, man.

30:54.896 --> 30:56.481
The van is one thing.

30:56.564 --> 30:59.817
If my daughter gets scratched,
I'll kill you.

30:59.901 --> 31:02.487
I don't care how bulletproof you are.

31:02.570 --> 31:04.989
She's safe with me. I promise.

31:06.073 --> 31:08.368
- Can we drop you at home?
- No, I'm fine.

31:08.451 --> 31:09.994
<i>- Muchas gracias, Mami.</i>
<i>- De nada.</i>

31:10.077 --> 31:11.954
- [Luke] You good?
- [Claire] Yeah.

31:13.039 --> 31:14.624
- I'll drive.
- Obviously.

31:28.179 --> 31:30.306
[groaning]

31:30.390 --> 31:33.810
He really needs surgery.
How far are we going?

31:33.893 --> 31:36.729
- Downtown to One Police Plaza.
- Police headquarters?

31:36.813 --> 31:39.691
Yeah, I'm gonna hand him
and the evidence over.

31:39.774 --> 31:41.568
The DA can take it from there.

31:41.651 --> 31:44.612
Get him round-the-clock protection
until he can testify against Cottonmouth.

31:44.696 --> 31:47.281
I'm dying back here.
You're still thinking about Cottonmouth?

31:47.364 --> 31:49.033
Yeah, you should be, too.

31:49.116 --> 31:51.285
If he's got as many cops
working for him as you say,

31:51.368 --> 31:53.287
he'll have them in the streets
looking for us.

31:54.539 --> 31:55.998
Call an EMT you can trust
to meet us there.

31:59.752 --> 32:02.213
I want to remind the viewers
that we're live.

32:02.296 --> 32:05.341
Call us using the number
at the bottom of your screen.

32:05.425 --> 32:09.303
I know the councilwoman
would love to answer your questions.

32:09.386 --> 32:12.640
Madam Councilwoman,
your home is stunning.

32:12.724 --> 32:14.476
Oh, thank you, Thembi.

32:14.559 --> 32:16.686
That's why people
are paying millions of dollars

32:16.769 --> 32:20.272
for brownstones like this one
on Convent Avenue.

32:20.356 --> 32:23.818
I mean, these buildings
must be preserved and protected.

32:23.901 --> 32:27.154
Let's talk politics.
Let's talk Damon Boone.

32:27.238 --> 32:28.531
Yes.

32:28.615 --> 32:33.786
That Stanford-educated carpetbagger
has been saying things about

32:33.870 --> 32:39.041
my voting record, about campaign finance,
that simply are not true.

32:39.125 --> 32:42.086
My complexes will do
for black-owned real estate

32:42.169 --> 32:45.172
what Geoffrey Canada has done
for education uptown.

32:45.256 --> 32:47.592
[scoffs]
I'm just setting the record straight.

32:49.594 --> 32:52.054
[Perez] Someone saw a green van
parked around the back.

32:52.138 --> 32:54.015
We got partial plates.

32:54.098 --> 32:55.808
- Well, let's hope we get a hit on it.
- [cell phone ringing]

32:55.892 --> 32:58.478
Otherwise, I'm not sure
where else to look.

32:58.561 --> 33:01.731
And what in the hell is taking
those damn unis so long to get here?

33:02.524 --> 33:04.066
[cell phone continues ringing]

33:05.610 --> 33:06.653
Yeah.

33:07.487 --> 33:10.657
I get that.
I get it, but we ran into a problem.

33:11.365 --> 33:15.119
And what the hell was Luke Cage
doing with Detective Scarfe?

33:20.082 --> 33:21.543
Do I need to remind you?

33:23.127 --> 33:24.504
If Scarfe talks,

33:25.421 --> 33:28.465
I ain't the only one going down,
Lieutenant Perez.

33:31.928 --> 33:34.055
Half the department's coming with me.

33:36.223 --> 33:37.517
Find him!

33:38.518 --> 33:40.269
[cell phone clatters]

33:46.400 --> 33:47.902
[Zip] Where's Shades?

33:47.985 --> 33:49.361
[exhales]

33:50.947 --> 33:52.406
I don't know.

33:56.327 --> 33:57.704
Let me step up.

33:58.621 --> 33:59.747
What you need?

34:01.583 --> 34:03.626
And how'd that work out last time?

34:07.504 --> 34:09.005
You got a choice?

34:11.759 --> 34:12.969
[clicks tongue]

34:16.639 --> 34:18.349
Put the word out on the street.

34:22.268 --> 34:24.438
A hundred large for Detective Scarfe.

34:26.273 --> 34:27.942
I want him dead.

34:28.943 --> 34:30.069
Dead.

34:31.237 --> 34:32.362
Dead.

34:33.364 --> 34:35.157
Look for a green van.

34:36.324 --> 34:37.909
Plate's 69-somethin'.

34:40.663 --> 34:41.831
[door closes]

34:47.962 --> 34:50.757
[Diontey] We're near the barber shop.
We'll head that way.

34:50.840 --> 34:52.759
Bring him to you or Mr. Stokes?

34:56.929 --> 34:58.097
Traffic sucks.

34:59.556 --> 35:02.143
There's a police checkpoint up ahead.

35:02.226 --> 35:04.270
Next couple of blocks, actually.

35:04.353 --> 35:05.938
Scarfe's people are looking for us.

35:06.022 --> 35:07.815
They're probably closing
the whole island down.

35:07.899 --> 35:09.651
Bridges, tunnels...

35:09.734 --> 35:11.694
That's the way I would've done it.

35:12.695 --> 35:13.738
[coughs]

35:13.821 --> 35:15.072
Don't take 128.

35:15.156 --> 35:17.491
- Which way?
- [Claire] Make a sharp right.

35:17.574 --> 35:19.786
- [tires screeching]
- Hang on.

35:19.869 --> 35:21.578
[horn honking]

35:21.663 --> 35:24.040
Hold on. You seen that?
Hold on. I think that was it.

35:24.123 --> 35:25.541
[tires screeching]

35:26.793 --> 35:27.919
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:28.920 --> 35:32.173
Zip... I think I just saw the van.

35:32.256 --> 35:33.716
And the name was right.

35:33.800 --> 35:35.927
What color did Cottonmouth
say that van was, though?

35:36.010 --> 35:39.096
- Blue.
- Green, nigga.

35:39.180 --> 35:41.015
Yo, I'm on them right now.

35:46.437 --> 35:47.604
Looks like we got company.

35:47.689 --> 35:50.066
[groaning] Is it a squad car?

35:50.149 --> 35:51.608
[Luke] Black SUV.

35:51.693 --> 35:53.277
I'll slow down and see if he passes.

35:58.282 --> 35:59.784
[laughs]

36:00.326 --> 36:01.869
- [gunshot]
- [glass shattering]

36:01.953 --> 36:02.954
[tires screeching]

36:03.412 --> 36:05.372
[Diontey] Back up! Move!

36:09.335 --> 36:11.378
- [Luke] Hold on back there!
- [Scarfe groaning]

36:12.839 --> 36:14.340
[horn honking]

36:16.008 --> 36:17.677
- [Claire grunting]
- [Scarfe groaning]

36:23.432 --> 36:25.226
[Diontey] There he is! Stay on him!

36:42.952 --> 36:44.495
[Luke] Kill the lights.

36:47.915 --> 36:49.291
There he is!

36:59.844 --> 37:01.178
[C-Money] Yeah. Come on, yo.

37:01.262 --> 37:03.014
[indistinct chatter]

37:10.897 --> 37:13.107
[indistinct chatter continues]

37:17.153 --> 37:18.695
[Diontey] Light his ass up!

37:25.244 --> 37:26.954
[tire deflating]

37:36.380 --> 37:37.589
Shit!

37:40.467 --> 37:42.428
I'm gonna circle around.
You three, through the hole.

37:42.511 --> 37:44.263
Go, go, go!

37:47.224 --> 37:49.018
[man] Yo, man.
[C-Money] Yo, through here!

37:59.403 --> 38:01.030
[man] Yo, here. Here.

38:02.698 --> 38:04.408
[C-Money] Come on, let's go!

38:07.036 --> 38:09.163
[sighs] What are we doing?

38:09.246 --> 38:12.499
- We should just head back to the precinct.
- No.

38:12.583 --> 38:14.460
If we hear something,
I wanna be ready to go,

38:14.543 --> 38:17.129
not stuck behind some damn desk.

38:17.213 --> 38:20.757
Can we at least go to Wendy's?
I dig them Frostys, man. [chuckles]

38:20.842 --> 38:22.176
Your stomach can wait.

38:22.259 --> 38:25.721
[dispatcher on radio] <i>10-13 near Bowery.</i>
<i>Repeat, shots fired near Bowery.</i>

38:25.805 --> 38:27.223
That's right near One Police Plaza.

38:27.306 --> 38:29.600
If they're running,
why would they go down there?

38:29.683 --> 38:31.352
Maybe they're not running.

38:31.435 --> 38:32.728
- [siren blaring]
- [siren stops]

38:33.687 --> 38:35.231
What the hell are you doing?

38:35.314 --> 38:37.066
Why do you wanna rush down there?

38:37.149 --> 38:39.401
He might need my help.

38:39.485 --> 38:41.988
Shots fired means he resisted arrest.

38:42.071 --> 38:43.447
They probably lit his ass up.

38:43.530 --> 38:46.117
If he's dirty or not,
you don't want to see that.

38:46.200 --> 38:47.534
He's still your partner.

39:01.841 --> 39:03.259
Detective Knight.

39:04.426 --> 39:05.552
[Perez] What's going on?

39:05.636 --> 39:07.096
Yeah, I'm trying
to head down there right now,

39:07.179 --> 39:08.555
but Perez is stopping me.

39:08.639 --> 39:11.517
- Who's that?
- Okay. Why?

39:11.600 --> 39:12.809
Who is that?

39:14.520 --> 39:17.606
Okay. I'll do that.

39:19.775 --> 39:21.485
Yeah, I'm glad you're okay.

39:24.113 --> 39:26.782
That was Scarfe, wasn't it? [snickers]

39:26.866 --> 39:28.075
What'd he say?

39:28.825 --> 39:30.786
Not to trust you.

39:30.870 --> 39:32.788
That you're in on all of this.

39:32.872 --> 39:36.042
What? Hell no!
You can't believe that rat! He's lying.

39:36.125 --> 39:39.336
He's in Cottonmouth's pocket
much deeper than I am.

39:39.420 --> 39:42.839
Bet... bet you didn't know that, hmm?

39:46.886 --> 39:48.387
No one was on the phone.

39:49.055 --> 39:50.514
Microphone check, five-o.

39:53.559 --> 39:55.019
You're too smart for your own good.
You know that?

39:55.102 --> 39:56.979
Yeah, I'd rather be a smart-ass
than a dumb-ass.

39:57.063 --> 39:58.439
Now give me your gun.

40:00.149 --> 40:01.400
[grunting]

40:02.568 --> 40:03.945
- [Misty screaming]
- [gunshot]

40:04.028 --> 40:05.571
[Perez grunting]

40:06.072 --> 40:07.364
- [Misty panting]
- [groaning]

40:08.282 --> 40:09.325
[grunting]

40:09.408 --> 40:11.493
[panting] Uh-huh.

40:11.577 --> 40:13.662
Okay, okay.

40:15.372 --> 40:17.499
Okay, okay.

40:18.584 --> 40:20.836
Now cuff yourself, you piece of shit!

40:22.296 --> 40:23.839
Roll the video.

40:25.716 --> 40:29.971
[Mariah through monitor] <i>You know,</i>
<i>my Harlem is saturated with jazz,</i>

40:30.054 --> 40:34.766
<i>and good food, and the pure genius</i>
<i>that permeates the streets.</i>

40:36.518 --> 40:40.314
<i>Harlem is risin'</i>
<i>like a phoenix out of the ashes.</i>

40:40.397 --> 40:43.943
<i>I mean, that's what</i>
<i>all of my various complexes is about,</i>

40:44.901 --> 40:46.695
<i>is restoring that luster.</i>

40:47.821 --> 40:49.698
- This is great.
<i>- I believe in Harlem.</i>

40:49.781 --> 40:51.200
This is great.

40:51.283 --> 40:52.952
Thanks for taping that earlier.

40:54.703 --> 40:57.123
You said you wanted something different.
This is it.

40:57.206 --> 40:59.583
I mean, you can...
you can see it all right there.

41:00.834 --> 41:02.503
And I don't just represent Harlem.

41:02.586 --> 41:05.047
- I am Harlem.
- And we're live.

41:05.131 --> 41:06.923
Which Harlem is you?

41:10.636 --> 41:13.930
- Pardon me?
- There are actually two Harlems.

41:14.015 --> 41:16.183
The one shown to us in that video.

41:17.143 --> 41:20.521
Historic, hardworking and hopeful.

41:20.604 --> 41:24.900
But in this next video,
we see an entirely different Harlem.

41:24.984 --> 41:26.860
A historically corrupt Harlem.

41:28.612 --> 41:32.241
Your grandmother,
the notorious Mabel Stokes,

41:32.324 --> 41:35.744
and her brother-in-law,
Pistol Pete Stokes, shown here,

41:35.827 --> 41:37.163
were major players in it.

41:37.663 --> 41:41.625
The boy in that photo would grow up to be
Cornell Stokes, aka Cottonmouth,

41:41.708 --> 41:46.672
a man whose name rings out
in both legitimate and criminal circles.

41:47.548 --> 41:50.926
Oh, that's a...
that's a personal photograph.

41:51.843 --> 41:54.346
You... you really, uh,
have no right to show that one.

41:54.430 --> 41:55.639
Well, how about this one?

41:56.807 --> 42:01.437
A somehow brutal assault that took place
at the Crispus Attucks Houses

42:01.520 --> 42:03.189
didn't make the news.

42:03.272 --> 42:07.734
Even stranger was the millions of dollars
in cash found on the premises

42:07.818 --> 42:09.695
in your office.

42:09.778 --> 42:12.156
There's some people on the scene
even describe a man

42:12.239 --> 42:14.658
who, under a barrage of gunfire,

42:14.741 --> 42:17.828
managed to beat down
a number of criminals,

42:17.911 --> 42:21.790
some of whom
may have worked for your family.

42:21.873 --> 42:25.711
So you can see
how it might be difficult to decipher

42:25.794 --> 42:27.879
which Harlem you stand for.

42:38.140 --> 42:41.977
Despite these unwarranted
attacks on my character,

42:42.936 --> 42:46.648
I have always tried
to make clear what I want...

42:47.608 --> 42:50.569
which I can't say for you, Thembi.

42:50.652 --> 42:54.030
It's very clear what you
and the rest of your media friends want.

42:54.115 --> 42:55.616
You want a story.

42:55.699 --> 42:57.743
Not the news. Not the truth.

42:57.826 --> 43:03.207
Just... a story
that you will do anything to sell.

43:03.290 --> 43:04.375
Shut it down!

43:05.000 --> 43:06.752
Stop. Alex!

43:06.835 --> 43:07.961
Thank you for your time.

43:08.044 --> 43:10.381
You get your ass out of my house.

43:20.224 --> 43:21.475
[panting]

43:21.558 --> 43:23.269
How long before we get
to police headquarters?

43:23.352 --> 43:24.936
I think we're near city hall.

43:25.729 --> 43:26.855
Ah, it's cold.

43:27.648 --> 43:29.275
Is it cold, or is it just me?

43:30.234 --> 43:32.944
We're close.
They'll warm him when we get there.

43:36.532 --> 43:37.824
[Claire grunts]

43:46.542 --> 43:48.252
[gunfire continues]

43:54.925 --> 43:56.385
[man 1] Yo, you should've died!

43:56.468 --> 43:57.844
[man 2] Come on, man. My shit's dead.

43:57.928 --> 43:59.596
[C-Money] Come on! Get it together, man!

43:59.680 --> 44:01.097
[man 1] Come on, get him!
[C-Money] Light him up!

44:01.182 --> 44:03.475
Now you're just pissin' me off.

44:03.559 --> 44:04.810
My turn.

44:04.893 --> 44:06.270
[men grunting]

44:17.072 --> 44:18.990
[Claire] We're gonna go up, okay?

44:20.326 --> 44:21.577
Come on.

44:21.660 --> 44:23.495
[Scarfe grunts]

44:23.579 --> 44:24.830
[panting]

44:24.913 --> 44:27.208
[Claire grunts] One more step.

44:27.291 --> 44:30.544
- I'm so tired.
- How far is it to One Police Plaza?

44:30.627 --> 44:33.214
I gotta... I gotta stop now.

44:33.297 --> 44:35.507
Yeah, we can stop as soon as we get there
and we're safe.

44:35.591 --> 44:37.218
I gotta see my son.

44:37.301 --> 44:39.595
You can see your son and anyone else
you want to when we get there.

44:42.348 --> 44:43.682
[crashing]

44:43.765 --> 44:45.684
[police sirens wailing]

45:09.833 --> 45:12.669
[panting] You okay?

45:12.753 --> 45:13.754
Yeah.

45:14.671 --> 45:16.507
At least I kept one promise.

45:16.590 --> 45:19.134
No scratches... on you.

45:19.217 --> 45:21.052
[groaning weakly]

45:27.183 --> 45:29.395
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold his head.

45:29.478 --> 45:31.313
Hold my hand. Look at me.

45:31.397 --> 45:33.315
Look at me. Breathe.

45:33.399 --> 45:34.775
- [breathing heavily]
- Breathe.

45:34.858 --> 45:36.026
- Breathe.
- [Misty] Hey!

45:36.109 --> 45:39.446
[panting] Hey. Listen, Scarfe.

45:39.530 --> 45:40.781
Okay, you've... [chuckles nervously]

45:40.864 --> 45:43.409
You've got a lot of explaining
to do, okay?

45:43.492 --> 45:45.201
And you're not getting out of it.

45:45.786 --> 45:47.037
[coughs]

45:49.331 --> 45:51.500
You better...

45:51.583 --> 45:54.169
You better let me do
the interrogation, partner.

45:54.252 --> 45:56.630
- I'm better... I'm better at it.
- [laughs]

45:56.713 --> 46:00.175
[chuckling] Oh, you're better at it?
No, you're not.

46:01.635 --> 46:03.804
- Huh?
- I got rapport.

46:06.264 --> 46:09.351
[crying] Yeah, you got rapport.

46:12.354 --> 46:13.730
[softly] I'm sorry.

46:15.316 --> 46:16.608
Rafe, no.

46:17.984 --> 46:19.361
Rafe, no.

46:22.197 --> 46:25.951
[crying] No. No, Rafe. No.

46:26.034 --> 46:28.244
No, Rafe, no.

46:29.663 --> 46:32.499
No, Rafe, please!

46:32.583 --> 46:33.875
[sobbing]

46:40.674 --> 46:43.176
[police sirens wailing]

46:44.135 --> 46:47.973
[R&B song playing]

47:49.117 --> 47:51.036
Get the rest of your shit and bugger off.

47:53.664 --> 47:54.831
Councilwoman Dillard,

47:54.915 --> 47:57.668
can you comment on the arrest
of your cousin, Cornell Stokes,

47:57.751 --> 47:59.044
at Harlem's Paradise tonight,

47:59.127 --> 48:02.088
on charges of police corruption,
extortion and murder?

48:02.172 --> 48:03.549
Alex!

48:03.632 --> 48:05.050
Is it true that he's responsible

48:05.133 --> 48:08.845
for the murder of decorated
Harlem police detective Rafael Scarfe?

48:08.929 --> 48:11.432
- Thank you for your time!
- Councilwoman, can we get a comment?

48:11.515 --> 48:13.434
Councilwoman, can we get just one comment?

48:13.517 --> 48:16.603
- Councilwoman! Councilwoman!
- [door closes]

48:18.480 --> 48:19.606
Shit!

48:20.566 --> 48:21.733
Shit!

48:23.026 --> 48:25.446
[Claire] You need to get some new clothes.

48:26.697 --> 48:28.740
[Luke] I have some stuff back at the crib.

48:29.700 --> 48:31.785
This is beginning to become a habit.

48:31.868 --> 48:34.955
[sighs] Swiss cheese shirt.

48:35.038 --> 48:37.248
Car bounces off of you.

48:37.332 --> 48:40.293
Punching through steel and concrete.

48:41.962 --> 48:43.589
Just another day, right?

48:45.340 --> 48:47.884
You're safe and your mom's van is insured.

48:48.927 --> 48:50.554
That's all that matters to me.

48:52.305 --> 48:54.933
After all that,
you can't say you're not special.

48:57.603 --> 48:59.813
I'm still not sure what I am.

48:59.896 --> 49:01.397
You know exactly who you are.

49:02.315 --> 49:03.984
And what you need to do.

49:04.067 --> 49:05.569
[chuckles]

49:05.652 --> 49:08.071
Pop used to say the same thing
you're saying to me.

49:09.990 --> 49:11.199
I did right by him.

49:12.158 --> 49:15.286
Cottonmouth's in jail... and I'm done.

49:16.872 --> 49:18.289
You're moving on?

49:19.666 --> 49:21.960
I think so.

49:22.043 --> 49:23.169
It's time.

49:24.212 --> 49:26.715
There's things with your powers
you haven't even tested.

49:27.633 --> 49:30.093
There's so many good things
that you could still do.

49:31.637 --> 49:32.929
Maybe I could help.

49:37.684 --> 49:39.645
- You have ideas?
- Yeah.

49:41.104 --> 49:43.982
Why don't we start
by getting some coffee first?

49:51.364 --> 49:54.951
- I'm not sleeping with you.
- Whoa! Did I say anything about that?

49:55.035 --> 49:58.789
Why can't coffee just be coffee, huh?

49:58.872 --> 50:01.833
Okay. You didn't even
touch your coffee this morning.

50:01.917 --> 50:04.711
You drank the orange juice. Okay?
You don't drink coffee.

50:09.591 --> 50:11.217
[telephone rings]

50:23.188 --> 50:24.397
[sighs]

50:26.149 --> 50:28.234
[scoffs] Cowards.

50:30.696 --> 50:32.238
What's going on?

50:32.322 --> 50:36.159
They're afraid of the headlines.
Police corruption.

50:36.242 --> 50:39.580
A crime boss who's related
to a prominent city councilwoman.

50:39.663 --> 50:43.458
And the only person
to tie it all together is a corrupt cop.

50:43.541 --> 50:45.043
A dead one at that.

50:45.126 --> 50:47.378
Then I'll be the one to tie it together.

50:47.462 --> 50:49.464
[scoffs]

50:49.547 --> 50:52.133
You're on the wrong side
of the glass for that, baby girl.

50:53.051 --> 50:55.428
First Fisk, then Cottonmouth.

50:55.511 --> 50:56.972
This is huge.

50:57.055 --> 51:00.642
But they're over there...
and we're right here.
