WEBVTT

00:17.867 --> 00:20.867
Hey, Kyles.
Oh, Kylie, you could be

00:20.867 --> 00:23.100
in my Snap.
And you're gonna say, "Yeah, I

00:23.100 --> 00:25.333
saw her go in the guest room."
She's gonna find us

00:25.333 --> 00:29.600
- in, like, bed together.
- One, two, three.

00:29.600 --> 00:33.967
- Hey, Kyles, have you seen Kenny?
- Hey, Snap.

00:33.967 --> 00:37.067
I literally just saw her go over
there.

00:37.067 --> 00:42.800
Maybe she went this
way.

00:42.800 --> 00:47.833
Wait, who is she in here with?
What the...?

00:47.833 --> 00:50.667
What?!
Okay, wait, hold on.

00:50.667 --> 00:52.267
Did it work?

00:52.267 --> 00:54.700
Wait,
who is she in here with?

00:54.700 --> 00:57.033
- What the...?
- It's so weird.

00:57.033 --> 00:59.033
So what's taking you guys so
long?

00:59.033 --> 01:01.133
What the...?

01:01.133 --> 01:03.800
Yeah, that's exactly
what you do.

01:03.800 --> 01:06.233
- Okay, now what?
- I don't know.

01:06.233 --> 01:08.267
- Now, do I say...
- We could get like...

01:08.267 --> 01:10.267
- Kylie!
- Let's get a video of

01:10.267 --> 01:12.267
Scott, like, just walking out of
the house, and you're like,

01:12.267 --> 01:14.267
"Yeah, that's right, you..."
That's right!

01:14.267 --> 01:16.267
- Okay, I'm leaving.
- Okay.

01:16.267 --> 01:17.933
- So, this is my back.
- Just keep

01:17.933 --> 01:20.267
walking straight.
You are so sick.

01:20.267 --> 01:23.467
You're so inappropriate.
Like, what is wrong with you?

01:23.467 --> 01:25.933
Everybody knows I'm
inappropriate.

01:25.933 --> 01:29.000
- Oh, it's so good.
- You're so... Okay.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.067
All right,
love you guys.

01:31.067 --> 01:33.067
Bye, love you!

01:51.067 --> 01:53.167
- Hi, Khloe.
- Hi.

01:53.167 --> 01:55.167
I'm so afraid to step
on your floor.

01:55.167 --> 01:57.167
I feel like I'll dirty
everything.

01:57.167 --> 01:58.500
I feel like it's
already dirty.

01:58.500 --> 02:00.167
Hello?

02:00.167 --> 02:02.167
Hi, it's Khloe
Kardashian.

02:02.167 --> 02:04.167
- How are you?
- I'm well.

02:04.167 --> 02:06.167
- How are you?
- I'm good.

02:06.167 --> 02:09.000
So, Lamar's coming in to see you
at, um, 5:00 today.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.200
- Okay.
- And he was just in a

02:12.200 --> 02:15.567
coma a few months ago and he's
on a ton of medications for that

02:15.567 --> 02:19.267
stuff, but they vary every week,
so it was hard for me to fill

02:19.267 --> 02:21.367
- out that form.
- We'll give him the

02:21.367 --> 02:23.567
best care possible.
And I'll reach out to you after

02:23.567 --> 02:25.667
- to give you a heads up.
- Okay, thank you so

02:25.667 --> 02:28.000
much.
Bye. Sorry.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Don't apologize.
You're so kind.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Got his nails done
this morning.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
He's in a massage right now.
He's gonna go to the eye doctor

02:34.000 --> 02:36.133
at 5:00, and then a
dermatologist is making a

02:36.133 --> 02:38.300
house call to his house 'cause
his skin is breaking out.

02:38.300 --> 02:40.267
- Bam.
- I don't know what he

02:40.267 --> 02:44.233
- would do without you.
- He doesn't know.

02:44.233 --> 02:49.800
Lamar has definitely come a long
way since his whole hospital

02:49.800 --> 02:53.067
situation.
I mean, I have put a lot of my

02:53.067 --> 02:56.300
life on hold to try to help
Lamar and get him on a great

02:56.300 --> 03:00.533
track.
But, you know, internally

03:00.533 --> 03:06.067
there's still so much that Lamar
has to fix about himself.

03:06.067 --> 03:08.633
I thought you were
calling a doctor for yourself.

03:08.633 --> 03:14.067
For something like, oh, God,
forgot my gynecologist wants to

03:14.067 --> 03:17.100
make an appointment with me and
then it's like 9,000 things

03:17.100 --> 03:20.867
- about yellow.
- I just want him to

03:20.867 --> 03:22.933
focus on positive things, so I
don't care.

03:22.933 --> 03:25.867
- Yeah.
- Um, did you have fun

03:25.867 --> 03:27.867
- last night?
- I had the best time

03:27.867 --> 03:29.867
in the world.
I'm so mad you didn't come with

03:29.867 --> 03:31.933
- us, though.
- Well, I was getting a

03:31.933 --> 03:34.200
- tan.
- I know.

03:34.200 --> 03:37.067
- That's very important.
- I wanted to know, so

03:37.067 --> 03:40.967
Kendall is doing a fashion show
in Cuba.

03:40.967 --> 03:43.733
I don't know how much time she
can spend with us, but let's go

03:43.733 --> 03:45.733
- out there to Cuba.
- Us, as in you and me?

03:45.733 --> 03:47.733
Yeah, you and I, and
we'll go and, like, chill with

03:47.733 --> 03:49.733
Kendall, like, whatever we can
do.

03:49.733 --> 03:52.033
So I think it's gonna be super
cool since it's still, like, new

03:52.033 --> 03:54.500
that we're allowed to go over
there, everything is still,

03:54.500 --> 03:56.533
like, 1950s.
Like, the style of everything,

03:56.533 --> 03:58.533
'cause all I hear is that people
are buying property over there

03:58.533 --> 04:00.533
- to like...
- Oh, God, am I gonna

04:00.533 --> 04:02.533
have to stop you from buying a
house?

04:02.533 --> 04:04.533
No, I don't want
to buy a house.

04:04.533 --> 04:06.967
I mean, all these developers are
buying hotels and this to make,

04:06.967 --> 04:10.067
like, 'cause it's gonna be a
huge tourist attraction.

04:10.067 --> 04:12.067
- It will be really fun.
- I would, I, honestly,

04:12.067 --> 04:14.067
it's on my bucket list, so it
would make me really, really

04:14.067 --> 04:16.067
- happy.
- Kim and Kourt are

04:16.067 --> 04:18.067
coming, too, but I'm happy
you're down to go.

04:18.067 --> 04:20.200
- Oh, I'm down.
- You're always my

04:20.200 --> 04:22.300
- wingman.
- You know what, babe?

04:22.300 --> 04:24.300
- I'm your lifer.
- Yeah.

04:24.300 --> 04:26.900
- That's what that is.
- I'm super excited

04:26.900 --> 04:29.000
about this trip.
I've always wanted the

04:29.000 --> 04:31.667
opportunity to go to Cuba.
And I need to start pushing

04:31.667 --> 04:34.233
myself to do things that are
more for me, instead of for

04:34.233 --> 04:37.433
everybody else.
So, we're going to Cuba!

04:37.433 --> 04:40.200
- Cuba! Yeah!
- It's gonna be

04:40.200 --> 04:42.533
- exciting.
- I'm excited.

04:50.467 --> 04:53.100
Like, you guys take
everything from me and that's,

04:53.100 --> 04:56.933
like, a known fact, but you have
the balls, though, to take

04:56.933 --> 05:00.467
something that's so
identifiable to me and my

05:00.467 --> 05:04.533
- personality and my home, right?
- And this started by me

05:04.533 --> 05:08.733
saying to her, "Oh, my God, you
didn't give Mom that Marilyn

05:08.733 --> 05:10.733
Monroe painting that's in her
kitchen?

05:10.733 --> 05:12.733
Oh, I thought you gave
it to her.

05:12.733 --> 05:14.733
She has the same exact one."
You have...

05:14.733 --> 05:16.733
- Is that the exact same print?
- Are you  out of

05:16.733 --> 05:18.733
- your...?
- I don't want, I don't

05:18.733 --> 05:20.733
even want it if it's the same
print.

05:20.733 --> 05:22.733
Mom, I'm obsessed
with Marilyn.

05:22.733 --> 05:26.100
And I, it's, like, my thing.
I have a Larry Schiller one...

05:26.100 --> 05:28.533
Like, I looked at the
Larry Schiller ones years ago,

05:28.533 --> 05:30.300
but I knew that was Khloe's
thing.

05:30.300 --> 05:32.033
- I love Marilyn.
- Yeah.

05:32.033 --> 05:34.800
- Mom?
- Oh, sorry.

05:34.800 --> 05:40.633
Okay, well, uh, this
Cuba trip, Kim, Kourt and the

05:40.633 --> 05:43.300
kids and Malika and Kanye and
all of them were all...

05:43.300 --> 05:45.333
We decided we all want
to go.

05:45.333 --> 05:47.333
We think it's gonna be so much
fun.

05:47.333 --> 05:50.000
Like, if they're doing this
Chanel fashion show and

05:50.000 --> 05:53.867
everything there, like, it's got
to be safe and...

05:53.867 --> 05:56.167
Kendall's supposed to
walk in Chanel.

05:56.167 --> 05:58.400
- I know.
- But I will tell you

05:58.400 --> 06:02.133
- guys that there's no Internet...
- If we're with our

06:02.133 --> 06:04.467
whole family, who needs to
call anyone?

06:04.467 --> 06:08.400
- Uh... me.
- Why wouldn't you come?

06:08.400 --> 06:11.567
I'm not going to Cuba.
I... I can't, if there's no

06:11.567 --> 06:14.367
communication...
I have work to do.

06:14.367 --> 06:18.500
The girls wanting to go to Cuba
is a little stressful for me.

06:18.500 --> 06:22.267
I feel very anxious about not
being able to communicate with

06:22.267 --> 06:24.333
- them while they're gone.
- You don't communicate

06:24.333 --> 06:26.733
either way.
Can't reach you...

06:26.733 --> 06:29.733
You guys can go down to

06:29.733 --> 06:32.800
- Cuba, have fun.
- It's, like, going to be

06:32.800 --> 06:35.267
legendary.
It's gonna be so much fun.

06:35.267 --> 06:37.900
And I heard the sangria is to
die for.

06:37.900 --> 06:40.067
I think the only thing
I'm gonna really enjoy about

06:40.067 --> 06:43.733
you guys being in Cuba-- I can
have some peace and quiet.

06:43.733 --> 06:47.900
All right, guys, well, I'll
enjoy my time, and you guys let

06:47.900 --> 06:51.267
me know when you get back,
because you certainly can't send

06:51.267 --> 06:55.067
me an e-mail when you land.
Hasta luego.

07:06.433 --> 07:09.800
KoKo, I got a
jellyfish stung!

07:09.800 --> 07:11.833
What?!
You got stung by a jellyfish?

07:11.833 --> 07:13.233
Uh-huh.
- Where?

07:13.233 --> 07:15.000
- Right here.
- No way.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.533
I did, too, before.
Where's my huggie?

07:16.533 --> 07:19.567
- So, what did you do?
- We put vinegar on

07:19.567 --> 07:21.733
- it.
- Masey, guess what?

07:21.733 --> 07:24.633
One time, I got stung by a
jellyfish two times.

07:24.633 --> 07:27.300
- Aw, Mase.
- Say KoKo.

07:27.300 --> 07:29.533
KoKo!

07:29.533 --> 07:31.767
- Hi, Reigny.
- It sucks that

07:31.767 --> 07:34.900
Kendall couldn't make the trip.
The whole reason we were even

07:34.900 --> 07:38.800
going to Cuba was because
Kendall was walking in the

07:38.800 --> 07:42.933
Chanel show there, but because
of last-minute changes, Kendall

07:42.933 --> 07:46.833
has dropped out, so since we all
have our travel plans, we're all

07:46.833 --> 07:50.933
- still going, and I'm so excited.
- Is Kim coming?

07:50.933 --> 07:52.933
- Yeah.
- Oh...

07:52.933 --> 07:54.933
Not here, though.
She's meeting us there.

07:54.933 --> 07:56.967
Oh, it's just us?
So we're gonna party on this

07:56.967 --> 07:59.900
plane?
What are you talking about?

07:59.900 --> 08:02.867
And Kim and Kanye
are in New York, so they are

08:02.867 --> 08:08.933
going to meet us in Cuba.
Khloe, did you guys spray

08:08.933 --> 08:11.267
- yourself with DEET?
- Yeah, I brought us,

08:11.267 --> 08:13.667
like, refills enough for four
days.

08:13.667 --> 08:16.567
I don't mess with,
like, real bug spray, but I'm

08:16.567 --> 08:19.400
not taking a chance.
We, like, doused ourselves,

08:19.400 --> 08:21.833
'cause I don't want to get the
Zika!

08:21.833 --> 08:25.000
- Oh, no.
- That is Cuba.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.267
Never been, but we're going as a
family together-- this is so

08:28.267 --> 08:30.600
exciting.
Are you excited for Cuba?

08:30.600 --> 08:32.733
- Are you?
- Yeah.

08:32.733 --> 08:36.200
We're on a world
tour.

08:36.200 --> 08:38.367
So, Scott couldn't get
into Cuba?

08:38.367 --> 08:41.800
He wanted to come,
but he told me the night before.

08:41.800 --> 08:45.467
And he was like, "I'm getting a
jet, let's go."

08:45.467 --> 08:48.233
- Is he coming?
- I don't think that

08:48.233 --> 08:51.800
he could get his traveling.
It's like really hard, I guess,

08:51.800 --> 08:55.533
to get a visa.
Scott decided at the last minute

08:55.533 --> 08:59.067
that he really wanted to come to
Cuba, but you need, like, visas

08:59.067 --> 09:02.933
and all this paperwork to be
filled out that takes, like,

09:02.933 --> 09:05.400
weeks and weeks, so he wasn't
able to make it.

09:05.400 --> 09:07.367
Were you fine with him
coming?

09:07.367 --> 09:12.233
Yep.
I said, "Come on down to

09:12.233 --> 09:14.700
Cuba town."
Yeah!

09:14.700 --> 09:16.500
We're landing
already?

09:16.500 --> 09:18.100
- Already?
- Five more minutes,

09:18.100 --> 09:22.133
we're landing!
I am annoyed, like, that I don't

09:22.133 --> 09:25.233
have contact to anybody that's
not with us.

09:25.233 --> 09:27.933
Like, the fact that I can't use
my phone does disturb me.

09:27.933 --> 09:29.700
- Yeah.
- It bothers me and

09:29.700 --> 09:32.400
that's my prerogative, like...
Kim has her husband and her

09:32.400 --> 09:35.833
babies with her, you have all
your babies with you, and then

09:35.833 --> 09:38.167
it's just me and Malika.
Like, we want to be able to talk

09:38.167 --> 09:41.400
to our friends or whatever, and
I want to be...

09:41.400 --> 09:42.833
- Guess what?
- No, but you get...

09:42.833 --> 09:45.400
- Friends schmrends.
- That's why you guys

09:45.400 --> 09:47.200
aren't tripping out about your
cell phones, you guys are with

09:47.200 --> 09:50.600
- all your family.
- Right.

09:50.600 --> 09:54.100
It's definitely scary
to go to another country and

09:54.100 --> 09:58.133
then not have any access to
back home.

09:58.133 --> 10:02.600
Lamar knows that it's not easy
to reach me because our cell

10:02.600 --> 10:06.667
phones don't work in Cuba and
there's, like, one hotel in all

10:06.667 --> 10:11.167
of Cuba that has Wi-Fi.
That's just a nerve-racking

10:11.167 --> 10:17.567
- thought.
- Oh, my God!

10:17.567 --> 10:19.933
- I'm so excited.
- Hello!

10:19.933 --> 10:22.000
I love so many things

10:22.000 --> 10:24.200
about Cuba.
There's history and culture,

10:24.200 --> 10:26.367
people are walking the streets,
and everyone is, like, enjoying

10:26.367 --> 10:28.367
- other people.
- Hi!

10:28.367 --> 10:31.400
- Hello!
- Lamar just asked for

10:31.400 --> 10:34.233
cash.
She has to give it to him in the

10:34.233 --> 10:35.967
- morning.
- He may ditch

10:35.967 --> 10:37.667

21:11.800 --> 21:14.567
Let's look and compete for
these ladies.

21:14.567 --> 21:17.567
If there's product here...
Ooh, boy.

21:17.567 --> 21:20.867
This is what happens when they
went to Cuba?

21:20.867 --> 21:23.467
- It's outrageous.
- Oy, boy.

21:23.467 --> 21:25.767
Matt, where's Khloe's
assistant?

21:25.767 --> 21:28.000
- I can track her down.
- Yeah.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.467
So maybe she could come get her
stuff.

21:30.467 --> 21:34.233
Okay, I think we're good.♪ ♪

21:34.233 --> 21:37.300
I haven't been here in so long,
it feels good.

21:37.300 --> 21:41.000
I was able to e-mail Kim, like,
twice.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.867
I haven't talked to them since
they've been in Cuba.

21:43.867 --> 21:46.600
They're not posting anything.
So I was just hoping that they

21:46.600 --> 21:50.067
were okay.
Even though I already knew the

21:50.067 --> 21:53.433
communication would be bad, it's
like crickets over there.

21:53.433 --> 21:56.733
I can't believe that they're out
there having this great time and

21:56.733 --> 21:59.267
probably not giving me a second
thought.

21:59.267 --> 22:02.467
And I'm sitting on pins and
needles, waiting to hear

22:02.467 --> 22:06.233
anything.
I didn't realize how much I miss

22:06.233 --> 22:08.100
them, you know?
When you don't know that they're

22:08.100 --> 22:10.733
right there to call or just, you
know, pop a text.

22:10.733 --> 22:13.900
The texting is what's crazy.
I didn't realize how much I

22:13.900 --> 22:16.433
relied on that for
communication.

22:30.333 --> 22:32.667
- What up, bro?
- Look at the pink and

22:32.667 --> 22:35.733
- purple car, Bubs.
- Do they have seats

22:35.733 --> 22:37.633
- in these or no?
- We could all ride

22:37.633 --> 22:40.533
- here.
- Okay.

22:40.533 --> 22:44.533
I almost didn't come to Cuba
because, like, all of the

22:44.533 --> 22:48.200
old-fashioned cars, you can't
put car seats in them because

22:48.200 --> 22:51.500
there's no seat belts at all,
so there's nothing to strap the

22:51.500 --> 22:55.267
seats into.
But, in Cuba, like, nobody's in

22:55.267 --> 22:59.933
a rush, and it just seems like
everybody is much safer, like,

22:59.933 --> 23:02.167
with the driving.
Everyone's just taking their

23:02.167 --> 23:05.567
time and getting places safely.

23:05.567 --> 23:07.433
Northie, I'm
videotaping.

23:07.433 --> 23:10.200
- Say hello.
- Hi.

23:10.200 --> 23:12.300
This gives me life,
guys.

23:12.300 --> 23:15.133
Are you having so much
fun?

23:15.133 --> 23:16.900
You like your little diamonds in
your ears?

23:16.900 --> 23:22.333
Oh, I get it.

23:22.333 --> 23:24.600
- What?
- I just asked her, "Do

23:24.600 --> 23:26.500
you like your diamonds in your
ears?"

23:26.500 --> 23:28.300
- Yeah?
- So now I understand

23:28.300 --> 23:30.767
the question.
I just asked, "Do you like your

23:30.767 --> 23:33.567
diamonds?"
What did she say?

23:33.567 --> 23:35.133
She didn't respond to
me.

23:35.133 --> 23:37.333
Did she say, "Dad,
are you trying to say you don't

23:37.333 --> 23:39.167
like my diamonds?"
But now I understand.

23:39.167 --> 23:41.200
This is the way you talk to
children.

23:41.200 --> 23:43.267
And 'cause you communicate with
children the most.

23:43.267 --> 23:46.000
No, I swear to God,
I swear to God, last night,

23:46.000 --> 23:49.533
I was laying in bed.
In the middle of the night,

23:49.533 --> 23:53.267
I woke up and I was thinking,
"That's how I talk to kids."

23:53.267 --> 23:57.433
- Yeah.
- Look at the lion,

23:57.433 --> 24:00.133
Mase.
The lion statue.

24:00.133 --> 24:02.033
Why is the lion
important?

24:02.033 --> 24:05.567
The symbol is power.

24:05.567 --> 24:08.167
- It symbolizes power.
- The lion.

24:08.167 --> 24:10.067
'Cause lions are
strong, right?

24:10.067 --> 24:15.167
- Yes, strong.
- Hi!

24:15.167 --> 24:16.833
You say hi to, like,
everyone.

24:16.833 --> 24:19.567
Yeah, we're supposed
to say hi to everyone.

24:19.567 --> 24:22.200
'Cause we're in a new place,
so we got to make friends.

24:33.667 --> 24:37.867
Out we go.
We're at the museum.

24:37.867 --> 24:40.567
- What is this?
- Ooh! It's a museum,

24:40.567 --> 24:41.833
Northie.
What's up, brother?

24:41.833 --> 24:43.533
- What's up, what's up?
- What's up?

24:43.533 --> 24:47.700
Everything is

24:47.700 --> 24:52.400
direct and made by real artists.
They make everything here and

24:52.400 --> 24:54.667
they show it here.
Please.

24:54.667 --> 24:56.567
Come on, guys,
let's walk.

24:56.567 --> 25:01.033
When we all are travelling to

25:01.033 --> 25:05.133
different countries, we love to
check out art, and so we are at

25:05.133 --> 25:10.133
Fábrica de Arte Cubano, which is
a huge studio set up by one of

25:10.133 --> 25:14.267
the biggest artists in Havana.
And this place was built to set

25:14.267 --> 25:17.600
- up an artist community.
- Feet!

25:17.600 --> 25:20.500
Daddy, look at his feet!

25:20.500 --> 25:23.667
- Yeah.
- Crazy feet.

25:23.667 --> 25:26.833
What are the nails
colored?

25:26.833 --> 25:29.000
The nails are kind of a
beige color, like a shark tooth.

25:29.000 --> 25:32.733
- Beige?
- Looks like green.

25:32.733 --> 25:35.033
It d-- it is like a
green too.

25:35.033 --> 25:37.967
I was gonna say green also.
You're so good with color.

25:37.967 --> 25:41.267
- Are you gonna be a artist?
- No.

25:41.267 --> 25:44.233
What are you gonna be
when you're big?

25:44.233 --> 25:46.500
- A bunny.
- A bunny?

25:46.500 --> 25:50.467
- That's much better.
- I love bunnies.

25:50.467 --> 25:52.367
I love bunnies so
much.

25:52.367 --> 25:54.867
- No, I love them.
- No, I love bunnies.

25:54.867 --> 25:58.100
Now, we're coming to

25:58.100 --> 26:01.533
the fashion area.
This is made with engine

26:01.533 --> 26:06.900
- gaskets, rubber gaskets.
- Look, P, clothes.

26:06.900 --> 26:09.800
- Let's walk around over here.
- All is handmade of

26:09.800 --> 26:11.567
- course.
- This is a...

26:11.567 --> 26:12.900
Concert and music
hall.

26:12.900 --> 26:18.333
Oh.♪ ♪

26:18.333 --> 26:20.933
This is the fine arts
gallery.

26:24.733 --> 26:27.400
His whole studio
with, like, tons of art, it's

26:27.400 --> 26:31.867
dedicated to music, and film and
all these different artistic

26:31.867 --> 26:34.967
outlets.
It's really amazing to see the

26:34.967 --> 26:38.233
artists use what they have
accessible to them on the

26:38.233 --> 26:40.200
- island.
- Let's hide you so

26:40.200 --> 26:42.300
no one could see you.
Okay?

26:42.300 --> 26:43.600
It was very
interesting.

26:43.600 --> 26:44.967
You are always
welcome.

26:44.967 --> 26:47.367
- Muchas gracias.
- Thank you so much.

26:47.367 --> 26:56.900
Bye, thank you.♪ ♪

26:56.900 --> 26:58.600
How cool.
Look at the old cars, like,

26:58.600 --> 27:01.767
driving on the freeway here.
Dick Tracy.

27:01.767 --> 27:03.667
It's so legendary.

27:06.000 --> 27:11.033
Look at that castle
over there, Mase.

27:11.033 --> 27:13.067
Everything's so cool,
right?

27:13.067 --> 27:15.667
And I really
feel like I'm in a movie, bro.

27:15.667 --> 27:18.467
And I like these weird colors.
I love, like, really, like,

27:18.467 --> 27:20.533
- weird colors like this.
- It's a cool blue, yeah.

27:20.533 --> 27:23.733
- Yeah.
- It's, like, really cool

27:23.733 --> 27:27.833
to be out here in Cuba where all
of the colors and everything are

27:27.833 --> 27:31.500
- really, like, so beautiful.
- Like, that's dope.

27:31.500 --> 27:34.400
That building's pretty dope.
The whole city is very easy

27:34.400 --> 27:36.867
vibe, anyway, like all those
weird tones.

27:36.867 --> 27:40.433
It feels like we're in a dream.
I need to shoot a music video

27:40.433 --> 27:42.767
- out here.
- Look at that cool

27:42.767 --> 27:48.767
tunnel... with the blue star.
Like, we need to take photos at

27:48.767 --> 27:51.767
those stands.
And then we can go through the

27:51.767 --> 27:54.933
tunnel like this.

27:54.933 --> 27:56.933
That's what I do that
when I'm in a convertible.

28:01.567 --> 28:03.567
- Hey, Kylie.
- Everyone's been in Cuba

28:03.567 --> 28:06.800
now for a few days and I have a
little more free time on my

28:06.800 --> 28:08.833
hands.
Now I can focus on Kylie a

28:08.833 --> 28:11.533
little bit.
M'kay.

28:11.533 --> 28:13.333
Did you get a good
video?

28:13.333 --> 28:16.567
I'm trying to make an
effort to be in the moment, but

28:16.567 --> 28:24.100
being unreachable is just not
like a settling feeling.

28:31.167 --> 28:34.133
Whoa, we're going on
an adventure.

28:34.133 --> 28:37.667
Look at all these cars, guys.

28:37.667 --> 28:39.400
All the colors are
so pretty.

28:39.400 --> 28:41.133
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

28:41.133 --> 28:43.733
Look at, we're gonna
pass the tunnel and we can

28:43.733 --> 28:48.467
- scream the whole time.
- One... two... three!

28:55.667 --> 28:57.600
We did it.

28:59.867 --> 29:01.867
P, you want to try
this?

29:01.867 --> 29:03.367
- Go ahead.
- Hold this.

29:03.367 --> 29:05.200
Hold it.

29:05.200 --> 29:08.233
Okay, Northie's
turn.

29:08.233 --> 29:13.633
Okay.

29:13.633 --> 29:15.633
You're like your
daddy.

29:15.633 --> 29:17.633
- You got to overdo it.
- So, these are, uh,

29:17.633 --> 29:19.967
some of the Havana Club
products.

29:19.967 --> 29:23.600
We are at Havana Club
and I'm so excited to see a rum

29:23.600 --> 29:28.333
distillery because Cuba makes
the best rum and just to smoke

29:28.333 --> 29:31.867
cigars, drink some rum, be like
really Cuban for the day.

29:31.867 --> 29:34.000
From this one on is
part of our iconic, uh,

29:34.000 --> 29:36.133
collection.
The one that you're going to try

29:36.133 --> 29:41.100
is our very, very special
product here, the extra aged rum

29:41.100 --> 29:43.100
- Máximo.
- Wow.

29:43.100 --> 29:46.533
It's the work of our grand rum
master, José Pablo Navarro.

29:46.533 --> 29:49.300
He has been working for the club
for 42 years.

29:49.300 --> 29:51.467
- Pablo?
- José Pablo Navarro.

29:51.467 --> 29:53.000
- José Pablo.
- What's his name?

29:53.000 --> 29:54.333
- Pablo, Pablo, Pablo.
- Pablo.

29:54.333 --> 29:57.700
One more Pablo.
Okay, follow me.

29:57.700 --> 30:00.100
Even though I'm not that
big of a drinker, I'm enjoying

30:00.100 --> 30:02.733
all the memories that we're
gonna have and it's really cool

30:02.733 --> 30:05.967
just to, like, soak up what the
culture is here.

30:05.967 --> 30:07.633
Rum doesn't age in
the bottle.

30:07.633 --> 30:08.967
- It ages only...
- In a barrel.

30:08.967 --> 30:10.367
...in the, uh, in
the barrel.

30:10.367 --> 30:12.767
So, once it's in a
bottle, it can't age anymore?

30:12.767 --> 30:15.000
No, not in the
case of rum.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.467
- Interesting.
- So, uh, the tasting

30:17.467 --> 30:22.467
we do with, uh, cigars and rum
sobremesa.

30:22.467 --> 30:25.433
is something you do
generally after you eat dinner.

30:25.433 --> 30:27.433
- Okay.
- It's that you chill,

30:27.433 --> 30:29.700
at the table, you share with
your friends.

30:29.700 --> 30:32.200
You share a drink, a cigar,
dessert.

30:32.200 --> 30:34.633
Americans don't do
that enough.

30:34.633 --> 30:38.900
Americans are rushing and always
wanting to go to the next place.

30:38.900 --> 30:41.933
I like it.
I like this Cub... this Cuban

30:41.933 --> 30:43.833
moment.

30:46.800 --> 30:50.700
I think that last
one's the best.

30:50.700 --> 30:52.633
Come on over, "ropa."
Check what I missed,

30:52.633 --> 30:54.300
- right?
- Is that it?

30:54.300 --> 30:56.700
- I like that one.
- I'm actually super

30:56.700 --> 30:59.433
into this 'cause I like fire and
I like alcohol.

30:59.433 --> 31:00.867
Right up your alley
today.

31:00.867 --> 31:03.100
And I really like
cigars.

31:03.100 --> 31:06.600
Hey, Kimmy, I see
you.

31:08.667 --> 31:10.700
- Don't inhale the air, okay?
- Yeah, she told me, after

31:10.700 --> 31:13.767
I did ten times.
What is the point of this then?

31:13.767 --> 31:16.000
Does anyone want mine?

31:16.000 --> 31:19.800
- Khloe does.
- Not really.

31:19.800 --> 31:24.667
Did you get a good
video?

31:24.667 --> 31:27.333
I'm trying to make
an effort to be in the moment,

31:27.333 --> 31:30.433
but being away from the hotel
and being unreachable is just

31:30.433 --> 31:32.333
not, like, a settling feeling.

31:36.067 --> 31:37.800
- Hey, Kylie.
- Have you heard from

31:37.800 --> 31:39.633
- your sisters?
- No.

31:39.633 --> 31:41.767
All my sisters are in Cuba and
she doesn't know what to do with

31:41.767 --> 31:43.733
- herself.
- It feels really awkward

31:43.733 --> 31:46.000
not being able to talk to
anybody or check in.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.700
Mom, I feel like
you're acting a little crazy.

31:48.700 --> 31:51.400
- M'kay.
- He didn't finish his

31:51.400 --> 31:54.100
therapy to get better and that
was his choice.

31:54.100 --> 31:55.700
He told me and Malika when we
were there.

31:55.700 --> 31:57.033
I was like, "Why are you
sleeping all day?"

31:57.033 --> 31:58.367
And, like, Malika was there,
like, "You got to get up, it's a

31:58.367 --> 31:59.700
beautiful day."
And he was like, "I've just had

31:59.700 --> 32:01.600
thoughts now, at night."

32:10.700 --> 32:12.400
Aren't the buildings
pretty?

32:12.400 --> 32:14.067
- Right now?
- Yeah.

32:14.067 --> 32:19.133
Okay, on the left
now is the Cemetery of Havana.

32:19.133 --> 32:21.700
It's the biggest cemetery in
Latin America.

32:21.700 --> 32:24.633
The name is Necropolis of
Columbus.

32:24.633 --> 32:27.333
- That's crazy.
- That's a beautiful

32:27.333 --> 32:29.733
- church, Armando.
- This is the San

32:29.733 --> 32:32.067
- Francisco de Paula Church.
- Oh, it's so pretty.

32:32.067 --> 32:34.733
This church used for
maternity hospital in 17th

32:34.733 --> 32:36.933
- century.
- Wow.

32:36.933 --> 32:38.933
It's beautiful
building.

32:38.933 --> 32:41.300
- Beautiful building.
- I can probably ride

32:41.300 --> 32:44.700
through this town all day long,
just, like, looking.

32:44.700 --> 32:47.300
Yeah, it's so cute.
Don't you feel like if you had

32:47.300 --> 32:49.800
someone with you in L.A. and you
had to drive them around,

32:49.800 --> 32:52.033
wouldn't you just say, "This is
the Valley."

32:52.033 --> 33:03.133
Right.♪ ♪

33:03.133 --> 33:05.367
What if I just, like,
dipped myself in the water?

33:05.367 --> 33:07.033
Mm-hmm, that would be
perfect.

33:07.033 --> 33:09.200
That it would be,
like, super wet and cool.

33:09.200 --> 33:16.633
Amazing.
Stay right there.

33:16.633 --> 33:18.967
I am doing a
photoshoot for one of my new

33:18.967 --> 33:23.233
lip kit colors, and it's just so
exciting to be a part of

33:23.233 --> 33:27.133
something that I have always
wanted, since I was little.

33:27.133 --> 33:30.567
He always tried to
escape.

33:30.567 --> 33:35.967
- Hey, Kylie.
- Oh, that looks great.

33:35.967 --> 33:38.400
You look so cute and pretty.

33:40.500 --> 33:43.967
Everyone's been in Cuba
now for a few days and I have a

33:43.967 --> 33:46.300
little more free time on my
hands.

33:46.300 --> 33:48.500
Now I can focus on Kylie
a little bit.

33:48.500 --> 33:52.767
Have you heard from your
sisters?

33:52.767 --> 33:54.667
No.

33:56.367 --> 34:04.233
I haven't heard from
anybody in, like, two days.

34:04.233 --> 34:07.300
- M'kay.
- I mean, you want have

34:07.300 --> 34:11.300
- a conversation? What's up?
- I'm just not used to

34:11.300 --> 34:14.633
- not hearing from anybody.
- My mom shows up.

34:14.633 --> 34:17.367
I didn't invite her.
All my sisters are in Cuba, and

34:17.367 --> 34:22.167
she doesn't know what to do with
herself, so she's harassing me.

34:22.167 --> 34:24.467
It feels really awkward
not being able to talk to

34:24.467 --> 34:27.400
- anybody or check in.
- Mom, you're acting

34:27.400 --> 34:32.867
- a little crazy.
- M'kay.

34:32.867 --> 34:34.900

- I'm just so upset.

34:56.900 --> 35:00.000
Yay, Mase!
We're here.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.667
We are the judges!

35:02.667 --> 35:05.000
That's how, isn't that
how you enter in convertibles?

35:05.000 --> 35:07.133
- Yup.
- Look at the water,

35:07.133 --> 35:08.800
- Mase.
- Cannon.

35:08.800 --> 35:11.033

35:17.033 --> 35:19.500
- What is that?
- A leaf and a stick.

35:19.500 --> 35:21.833
Is that, like, a magic
stick?

35:21.833 --> 35:23.833
- Babe, don't say that.
- What is it?

35:23.833 --> 35:25.467
- Don't say that.
- Oh, sorry.

35:25.467 --> 35:27.267

- What is a magic stick?

35:27.267 --> 35:28.900
Oh, sorry.

35:28.900 --> 35:31.333
Oh, come on, Bubs.
Do you see the water?

35:31.333 --> 35:33.200
They all wanted to sit
next to KoKo.

35:33.200 --> 35:34.633
It's good to be an
aunt.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.500
You know what?
Don't have kids, don't need

35:36.500 --> 35:39.367
- them.
- Khlo, Kanye and I

35:39.367 --> 35:42.333
- had a discovery in the car.
- What?

35:42.333 --> 35:44.433
He said that he
realized... 'cause he said to

35:44.433 --> 35:47.567
North, "Hey, North, do you like
your diamonds?"

35:47.567 --> 35:52.067
And then he said, "The way that
I talk is how I talk to a kid."

35:52.067 --> 35:54.833
And I said, "I swear I woke up
in the middle of the night and

35:54.833 --> 35:57.900
thought that to myself."
And I said to Kanye, 'cause he's

35:57.900 --> 36:01.033
like, "I would never say
anything intentionally to hurt

36:01.033 --> 36:03.100
your feelings."
I think you two are

36:03.100 --> 36:05.200
- just not vibing right now.
- No, no, we are.

36:05.200 --> 36:07.600
- We are.
- So what's worse?

36:07.600 --> 36:10.467
Uh, intentionally trying to hurt
me or talking to me like a

36:10.467 --> 36:12.400
child?

36:12.400 --> 36:14.400
That's the way I like to be
communicated with anyway,

36:14.400 --> 36:16.267
- mostly.
- Yeah.

36:16.267 --> 36:19.500
- I keep it simple.
- Yeah. I get it.

36:19.500 --> 36:22.467
You know they have,
like, potato rations here, so,

36:22.467 --> 36:25.133
like, you can only get a certain
amount, 'cause there's not a

36:25.133 --> 36:26.767
- lot.
- Thank you.

36:26.767 --> 36:28.467
Khloe went out of

36:28.467 --> 36:31.600
town and Lamar kept asking,
like, "When are you leaving?

36:31.600 --> 36:33.433
When are you leaving?"
And then the day she left,

36:33.433 --> 36:36.500
- he asked for cash.
- So what?

36:36.500 --> 36:39.500
- What do you think?
- What?

36:39.500 --> 36:41.900
Just telling him
about Lamar.

36:41.900 --> 36:44.733
But you're so upset,
but...

36:44.733 --> 36:47.533
But doesn't he want to
start playing ball again?

36:47.533 --> 36:50.033
He never wanted to
stop playing ball, but you just

36:50.033 --> 36:52.300
can't live that lifestyle and do
that.

36:52.300 --> 36:54.400
And I tell him... without
discouraging him, I'm like, you

36:54.400 --> 36:57.733
know, like, let's like, focus on
coaching, like, Kobe just

36:57.733 --> 37:00.667
retired.
But his motor skills are not

37:00.667 --> 37:03.767
- what they used to be.
- Yeah.

37:03.767 --> 37:08.733
He was such a great
athlete and didn't even try.

37:08.733 --> 37:12.667
Like, that's him not trying.
When he got off the Clippers is

37:12.667 --> 37:18.833
when he started doing that.
And he didn't finish his therapy

37:18.833 --> 37:21.533
to get better.
And that was his choice.

37:21.533 --> 37:23.233
He told me and Malika when we
were there.

37:23.233 --> 37:25.067
I was like, "Why are you
sleeping all day?"

37:25.067 --> 37:26.933

like, "You got to get up, it's a

37:26.933 --> 37:28.733
beautiful day.
Like, go on a walk or

37:28.733 --> 37:30.133
something."
And he was like, "I just have

37:30.133 --> 37:31.733
thoughts now, at night."

37:33.767 --> 37:36.733
And I was like, "Well, what do
you think about?

37:36.733 --> 37:38.533

to go to a counselor, 'cause I

37:38.533 --> 37:41.167

We're excited, just because we
studied and read Ernest

41:54.333 --> 41:58.167
Hemingway, and it's cool to see
how people live.

41:58.167 --> 42:00.400
Welcome to our museum.
My name is Isbel.

42:00.400 --> 42:02.433
I'm going to be your guide.
And that's the house of

42:02.433 --> 42:04.933
Hemingway.
In 1928, it was the first time

42:04.933 --> 42:08.033
Hemingway visit Cuba.
Only 48 hours, but was enough.

42:08.033 --> 42:10.567
He was in love.
When Hemingway received a

42:10.567 --> 42:14.067
special guest, he used to ring
the bell to say "welcome."

42:14.067 --> 42:18.000
Today, for you.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.967
Are those his
magazines and books?

42:19.967 --> 42:21.767
Yes.
Everything is authentic.

42:21.767 --> 42:24.367
Furniture, paintings, animals on
the wall.

42:24.367 --> 42:26.833
He was a hunter.
As you can notice, it's not

42:26.833 --> 42:29.000
luxury in the house.
Everything is simple, but nice

42:29.000 --> 42:31.433
and practical.
That was Hemingway's style.

42:31.433 --> 42:33.567
You want to walk around and see
the rest of the rooms?

42:33.567 --> 42:36.167
- Sure.
- His private bathroom,

42:36.167 --> 42:38.667
only for Hemingway.
One of the most interesting

42:38.667 --> 42:41.467
thing here is on the wall.
That's Hemingway's handwriting.

42:41.467 --> 42:43.833
You see the scale there?
He'd check his weight almost

42:43.833 --> 42:45.933
every day and take notes on the
wall.

42:45.933 --> 42:48.133
- That's like me.
- You do the same?

42:48.133 --> 42:51.267
- Yeah, I do.
- That's cool.

42:51.267 --> 42:54.533
This house is so cool.
It's such a part of Cuban

42:54.533 --> 42:57.033

see this.

42:57.033 --> 42:59.700
I just want her to, like, live
life and enjoy herself,

42:59.700 --> 43:02.300
and not worry about it all.
Which just breaks my heart,

43:02.300 --> 43:04.967
'cause it's like the same cycle
all over again.

43:04.967 --> 43:07.700
- It just really sucks.
- First time in Cuba?

43:07.700 --> 43:09.933
Mm-hmm.
- Not the last, I hope.

43:09.933 --> 43:13.700
No, we love it.
It's so beautiful.

43:13.700 --> 43:18.433
