00:00.001 --> 00:02.443
-Stay with us, friend.
-Colonel Despard.

00:02.445 --> 00:05.678
-My name is Catherine Despard.
-Ned's wife?

00:05.680 --> 00:08.118
Will you take on his case? It may be
the rashest thing you ever do.

00:08.119 --> 00:09.718
When do we leave?

00:09.720 --> 00:13.478
Mr Ralph Hanson Of the Mosquito
Shore Mahogany Company.

00:13.480 --> 00:15.398
My daughter, Cecily.

00:15.400 --> 00:17.958
Heaven save me from upstart
Irishmen.

00:17.960 --> 00:22.358
In Honduras, I was plagued by a most
vexatious specimen.

00:22.360 --> 00:23.838
If you work for me,

00:23.840 --> 00:25.238
there must be trust.

00:25.240 --> 00:27.118
-Did you do this?
-I did not.

00:27.120 --> 00:28.318
-To my mother.
-To Elizabeth.

00:28.320 --> 00:29.598
Elizabeth!

00:29.600 --> 00:32.878
We should make arrangements for your
investiture by the King himself.

00:32.880 --> 00:35.158
I'll remind Elizabeth!
It must have slipped her mind.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.358
His Majesty's Government can always
find a covert role

00:37.360 --> 00:38.758
for a person of your...

00:38.760 --> 00:40.118
..talents.

00:40.120 --> 00:42.158
What might the Government be willing
to do in return?

00:42.160 --> 00:43.758
What do you recommend? A quiet life?

00:43.760 --> 00:45.558
My head down and my mouth shut?

00:45.560 --> 00:46.960
Where would be the fun in that?

01:32.040 --> 01:33.520
Oi!

01:35.600 --> 01:36.640
Oi!

01:38.800 --> 01:40.200
Give us a penny?

01:42.720 --> 01:44.000
Look, Jeremy!

01:45.000 --> 01:47.760
Mama, why are there so many
soldiers?

01:53.160 --> 01:55.200
-'Ey!
-Papa!

01:57.560 --> 01:59.118
Thank you, sir.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.800
We have guests.

02:05.240 --> 02:08.238
Here he is! The root of all evil!

02:08.240 --> 02:09.440
Devil incarnate.

02:11.320 --> 02:12.880
At your service, ma'am.

02:15.160 --> 02:16.438
I'm afraid you have a houseful!

02:16.440 --> 02:17.720
Yes, I see that!

02:18.840 --> 02:20.918
-What's the name of this soldier?
-Jeremy.

02:20.920 --> 02:22.800
Pleased to meet you, Jeremy.

02:28.480 --> 02:30.718
What are you reading?

02:30.720 --> 02:32.158
Poetry?

02:32.160 --> 02:33.400
Romance?

02:37.960 --> 02:40.918
A Vindication Of The Rights of
Woman?

02:40.920 --> 02:42.918
What "rights" could a girl possibly
want

02:42.920 --> 02:45.758
that a well-connected husband could
not supply?

02:45.760 --> 02:48.078
Mrs Wollstonecraft touches on that
subject, papa.

02:48.080 --> 02:49.478
Perhaps you should read her?

02:49.480 --> 02:50.918
I have no time to waste on reading

02:50.920 --> 02:52.440
the ravings of an educated woman.

02:53.760 --> 02:55.480
And soon, I hope, nor will you.

02:57.600 --> 02:59.960
George Warleggan has been invited to
call.

03:02.240 --> 03:03.998
Will you join us?

03:04.000 --> 03:06.398
Tomorrow he will be SIR George
Warleggan.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.320
May I defer that pleasure?

03:10.440 --> 03:12.318
There'll be a reckoning when I
discover

03:12.320 --> 03:14.078
who's responsible for my disgrace.

03:14.080 --> 03:15.598
Do nothing in haste.

03:15.600 --> 03:18.118
-They've no evidence of treachery.
-Because none exists.

03:18.120 --> 03:21.758
But evidence of loyalty, to present
to those who can influence

03:21.760 --> 03:24.758
the matter and restore you to your
post,

03:24.760 --> 03:26.478
THAT I'm keen to procure.

03:26.480 --> 03:28.878
Do you know anyone who could speak
in your favour?

03:28.880 --> 03:32.598
Bannantine, my secretary.

03:32.600 --> 03:34.958
But I've no notion where he went
after I was recalled.

03:34.960 --> 03:36.678
I'll make enquires.

03:36.680 --> 03:39.598
If he could help us discover who
falsely accused you...

03:39.600 --> 03:41.720
My money's on that bastard Hanson.

03:43.200 --> 03:46.118
But he alone could not have had me
recalled.

03:46.120 --> 03:49.158
Someone here, with vested interests

03:49.160 --> 03:50.878
and no mean powers

03:50.880 --> 03:53.718
and connections, even up to
the Mad King himself,

03:53.720 --> 03:55.798
must have done that.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.360
But they'll pay for it.

04:01.320 --> 04:04.918
These areas here, here, here and
here

04:04.920 --> 04:09.038
have yielded riches beyond measure
for upwards of 30 years.

04:09.040 --> 04:11.558
But now demand outstrips supply

04:11.560 --> 04:14.838
so there is a need to push to
regions more remote,

04:14.840 --> 04:18.358
extraction thus more difficult,

04:18.360 --> 04:21.920
more labour thus required...

04:24.800 --> 04:26.120
Slave labour.

04:28.840 --> 04:30.200
Would that be a concern?

04:32.040 --> 04:33.560
Why would it?

04:37.720 --> 04:42.998
Now, one is naturally reluctant to
invite new investors to take

04:43.000 --> 04:44.480
a slice of the pie.

04:46.480 --> 04:48.638
But, due investment being required

04:48.640 --> 04:50.798
and the rewards being bountiful...

04:50.800 --> 04:52.400
All parties win.

05:00.320 --> 05:02.160
I've never heard of the man.

05:03.200 --> 05:04.720
Bannantine...?

05:08.360 --> 05:09.798
I have no idea where he might be.

05:09.800 --> 05:11.798
Mm, no.

05:11.800 --> 05:14.360
I've heard no word of Bannantine in
months.

05:17.320 --> 05:19.678
It would appear that Bannantine has
vanished.

05:19.680 --> 05:21.198
What's it taking so long?!

05:21.200 --> 05:23.720
Ned, you need to have patience.

05:27.960 --> 05:29.600
A veritable Nelson!

05:32.080 --> 05:34.398
And all on credit!

05:34.400 --> 05:37.278
As will be my training...

05:37.280 --> 05:40.318
..unless I can secure a wealthy
benefactor.

05:40.320 --> 05:44.598
Perhaps you could sell your charms
to an elderly duchess?

05:44.600 --> 05:46.638
Good thought! Do you know of any?

05:46.640 --> 05:49.518
Oh, Vauxhall is threshing with them!

05:49.520 --> 05:51.318
You should try your luck tonight.

06:00.880 --> 06:02.438
You seem quite yourself again.

06:02.440 --> 06:04.078
Why would you think otherwise?

06:04.080 --> 06:06.438
Because, in the days before our
departure,

06:06.440 --> 06:08.238
you appeared a little...

06:08.240 --> 06:11.920
..disordered with talk of Elizabeth.

06:14.080 --> 06:15.558
Yes?

06:15.560 --> 06:18.720
As if she was still with us.

06:20.560 --> 06:22.800
Are you sure it's not YOU who
is disordered?

06:38.880 --> 06:40.560
When will Papa return?

07:19.720 --> 07:21.678
See'd Morwenna by the quay.

07:21.680 --> 07:22.720
Is there news?

07:23.720 --> 07:25.038
What manner of news?

07:25.040 --> 07:26.398
She looked so delicate and pale,

07:26.400 --> 07:28.358
I thought maybe there was...?

07:28.360 --> 07:29.838
What?

07:29.840 --> 07:31.160
A child coming?

07:33.560 --> 07:35.600
Not unless it's a fairy child.

07:39.320 --> 07:41.440
She does keep her distance, still?

07:42.360 --> 07:43.760
She's yet so broken...

07:46.800 --> 07:48.320
..and may never mend.

07:59.560 --> 08:01.038
Right, impudence!

08:01.040 --> 08:04.118
Get up and whitewash yon wall ye
burnt!

08:04.120 --> 08:07.438
And wipe that smirk off,
'fore this besom do!

08:07.440 --> 08:09.438
I can't help it, missus.

08:09.440 --> 08:11.678
Thinking how I'd take a strap
to 'ee,

08:11.680 --> 08:13.278
were I mistress here.

08:13.280 --> 08:15.560
Thee? Mistress here?

08:18.880 --> 08:20.720
Stranger things have happ'd.

08:29.880 --> 08:32.238
No-one can tell me
where Bannantine is,

08:32.240 --> 08:34.518
but there is someone I think
we should meet.

08:34.520 --> 08:37.960
The King declines to intervene on my
behalf...

08:39.200 --> 08:44.080
..while I sit caged in a lodging
house, twiddling my thumbs.

08:45.320 --> 08:46.638
Put 'em to use, then!

08:46.640 --> 08:48.678
Tomorrow we have an appointment with
Joseph Merceron.

08:48.680 --> 08:50.118
Tonight we promenade.

08:50.120 --> 08:51.758
Thank you, no.

08:51.760 --> 08:55.958
Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens hold
few attractions for me!

08:55.960 --> 08:58.038
Does Kitty not deserve a night
on the town?

08:58.040 --> 08:59.958
If she's anything like my wife...

08:59.960 --> 09:01.320
Which she is.

09:04.040 --> 09:07.358
Were you not all set to marry some
Irish countess after the war?

09:07.360 --> 09:09.958
And you some Cornish heiress?

09:09.960 --> 09:11.440
She preferred my cousin.

09:12.480 --> 09:13.520
Lucky for you.

09:15.240 --> 09:17.518
Do you think we made the right
choices?

09:17.520 --> 09:19.398
Yes.

09:19.400 --> 09:21.040
But not the easy ones!

09:33.200 --> 09:36.358
Where did he pick THAT
up?

09:36.360 --> 09:37.760
Tasty.

09:49.480 --> 09:51.038
Why do they look at her so?

09:51.040 --> 09:52.598
Do they think she's...?

09:52.600 --> 09:53.800
-A courtesan.
-What?!

09:54.880 --> 09:57.040
Dear Lord, Ross, how dare they?!

09:59.800 --> 10:01.520
Isn't that Despard...?

10:03.880 --> 10:05.240
Shame on you!

10:07.880 --> 10:09.360
Shame on you, Despard!

10:11.360 --> 10:13.118
Traitor!

10:22.360 --> 10:23.960
Colonel Despard.

10:26.560 --> 10:28.080
Mr Hanson...

10:29.440 --> 10:32.438
..of the Mosquito Shore
Mahogany Company.

10:32.440 --> 10:35.478
Now returned to English soil.

10:35.480 --> 10:38.358
You remember my wife, Catherine.

10:38.360 --> 10:40.478
It's brave of you to venture out,
ma'am,

10:40.480 --> 10:42.958
in view of your husband's
fall from grace.

10:42.960 --> 10:45.758
But then, perhaps, you're not...

10:45.760 --> 10:48.560
..unfamiliar with contempt?

10:50.960 --> 10:54.358
You'll be familiar with my fist
if you don't apologise to my wife.

10:54.360 --> 10:57.398
Ned, I'm sure Mr Hanson
meant no offence.

10:57.400 --> 11:00.480
I can assure you none was taken.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.958
As ever, we are redeemed by the
fairer sex.

11:11.960 --> 11:16.160
No, I think it will take a lot more
than that...

11:18.200 --> 11:19.840
..to redeem you, sir.

11:21.720 --> 11:23.560
Ma'am.

11:26.240 --> 11:27.758
Shall we?

11:27.760 --> 11:30.078
You go crawl back under your stone,
Hanson!

11:30.080 --> 11:32.318
Rest assured, you'll be made to pay!

11:32.320 --> 11:34.558
Ned! Be calm.

11:34.560 --> 11:35.998
Come away, now.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.718
It's time we go.

11:37.720 --> 11:39.318
She's a better woman than I.

11:39.320 --> 11:41.878
-I'd have let him crown the man.
-I would've helped.

11:41.880 --> 11:43.838
-How does that serve his cause?
-Dwight...

11:43.840 --> 11:45.918
In fairness, the man was to blame
for his demise.

11:45.920 --> 11:47.758
Ned's agreed to take me home
now.

11:47.760 --> 11:50.118
I think Kitty would feel safer
indoors.

11:50.120 --> 11:51.518
Then we'll all go.

11:51.520 --> 11:54.278
No, please, we'd prefer to have time
by ourselves.

11:54.280 --> 11:55.880
Of course, my dear.

11:59.320 --> 12:01.480
And this is our new century?

12:18.200 --> 12:19.920
Cecily...!

12:33.440 --> 12:36.558
Did I not say you'd be spoilt for
choice?

12:36.560 --> 12:39.518
The honourable Miss DeVere?
Countess Hathersage?

12:39.520 --> 12:41.998
The more frightful the specimen,
the better your chances!

12:42.000 --> 12:43.520
I'm flattered!

12:45.720 --> 12:48.238
And you? Seen anyone to your liking?

12:48.240 --> 12:50.078
No-one of whom Papa would approve.

12:50.080 --> 12:52.398
You have no choice in the matter?

12:52.400 --> 12:54.838
Did your mama choose her mate?

12:54.840 --> 12:56.598
I expect she was somewhat directed.

12:56.600 --> 12:58.000
And mine.

12:59.120 --> 13:00.520
And it cost her.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.998
All the more reason for you to be
mistress of your fate.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.358
Tell that to Papa.

13:05.360 --> 13:07.160
I shall, if I ever meet him.

13:08.960 --> 13:10.478
Now's your chance.

13:10.480 --> 13:11.760
He's over there.

13:13.800 --> 13:15.598
Go on.

13:15.600 --> 13:17.360
I dare you.

13:20.080 --> 13:21.360
Very well.

13:36.360 --> 13:37.758
What are you doing?

13:37.760 --> 13:39.638
Miss Hanson dared me

13:39.640 --> 13:42.158
to tell her papa she should marry
as she chooses.

13:42.160 --> 13:45.038
Miss Hanson's papa is not one to
take advice.

13:45.040 --> 13:46.678
You know him?

13:46.680 --> 13:48.238
I know he's a man you should avoid.

13:48.240 --> 13:49.880
-But...
-Just trust me.

13:57.240 --> 13:59.678
So, what's to be done for Ned?

13:59.680 --> 14:01.440
My hope is on Joseph Merceron.

14:15.960 --> 14:17.358
-Gentlemen.
-Mr Merceron.

14:17.360 --> 14:18.798
You wished to see me...

14:18.800 --> 14:19.878
Please.

14:19.880 --> 14:22.318
..in my capacity as patron of our
local charities...?

14:22.320 --> 14:24.678
No, sir, as magistrate who presided
over

14:24.680 --> 14:26.398
Colonel Despard's hearing.

14:26.400 --> 14:28.600
And his subsequent unlawful
detention.

14:29.920 --> 14:31.678
At the time of the hearing,

14:31.680 --> 14:34.998
was there ever mention of a man
named Bannantine?

14:35.000 --> 14:36.438
Bannantine?

14:36.440 --> 14:38.398
My secretary in Honduras.

14:38.400 --> 14:40.398
We believe he's been in London for
some time

14:40.400 --> 14:42.478
and wondered why he was not called
upon

14:42.480 --> 14:45.398
-to give evidence in his master's defence?
-Now, I recall.

14:45.400 --> 14:48.158
The man was, indeed, sought
but could not be found.

14:48.160 --> 14:50.438
His testimony could have made
all the difference.

14:50.440 --> 14:54.080
In fully restoring my reputation and
enabling me to return to my post.

14:56.480 --> 14:59.078
-Is that your intention?
-Why, man, what else would it be?!

14:59.080 --> 15:01.958
This conspiracy has robbed me of
my name and my position

15:01.960 --> 15:04.840
-and I want them restored!
-Colonel... -It is my right!

15:07.880 --> 15:10.080
And I'll not rest till
it's been granted.

15:13.880 --> 15:16.278
Well, gentlemen, if I can be
of any assistance

15:16.280 --> 15:18.238
in your search for
Mr Bannantine...

15:18.240 --> 15:19.358
We'd be most grateful.

15:19.360 --> 15:21.958
And should you yourself discover
him, please do let me know.

15:21.960 --> 15:23.000
Of course.

15:26.400 --> 15:28.680
-Well, I wish you luck, colonel.
-Huh!

15:46.040 --> 15:47.520
I'm a little out of practice.

15:49.200 --> 15:51.398
You were never up to my standard.

15:51.400 --> 15:54.838
Somebody must fight you, if only to
prevent you fighting all the world.

15:54.840 --> 15:56.998
Joseph Merceron was trying to help.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.918
I suppose I should thank you.

15:58.920 --> 16:00.238
But what help can he bring?

16:00.240 --> 16:02.440
I know you cannot bear inaction.

16:04.480 --> 16:06.398
Or favours.

16:06.400 --> 16:09.760
Or not being permitted to fight
your own battles.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.438
I scarce know what those battle are.

16:15.440 --> 16:17.040
I'll tell you when they're won.

16:21.440 --> 16:23.640
How can one win against
an invisible enemy?

16:46.960 --> 16:49.480
-Enough! Enough!
-Sir.

16:55.880 --> 16:58.440
Would you like me to
do that, my dear?

17:01.960 --> 17:04.758
After all...

17:04.760 --> 17:07.877
..it would not do to be
late for the king

17:07.880 --> 17:09.720
when one is receiving a knighthood.

17:14.400 --> 17:21.397
Ladies, gentlemen, fellow members of
the Royal College of Surgeons,

17:21.400 --> 17:24.798
may I welcome you to this lecture in
which I will attempt to articulate

17:24.800 --> 17:27.637
my own - perhaps
controversial - views

17:27.640 --> 17:29.880
of the causes and treatment
of insanity.

17:41.840 --> 17:45.838
I have come to consider insanity
not as a moral failing,

17:45.840 --> 17:47.520
nor an inherited one...

17:49.200 --> 17:52.680
..but an affliction which may
happen to the best of us.

17:56.920 --> 17:58.278
I am, of course, aware of

17:58.280 --> 18:00.278
the plethora of conventional
treatments -

18:00.280 --> 18:05.160
many and varied, but alike in their
brutality and lack of humanity.

18:09.400 --> 18:11.878
Sir, are you suggesting that the
mad man - or woman -

18:11.880 --> 18:14.878
does not benefit from a firm hand?

18:14.880 --> 18:18.358
From my own observation
and experience, I suggest that

18:18.360 --> 18:23.280
patience and simple kindness can
yield equal, if not better, results.

18:24.360 --> 18:27.398
But what of the man who attempted
to assassinate His Majesty?

18:27.400 --> 18:30.358
I do not know his history,
ma'am, but...

18:30.360 --> 18:31.918
He is a soldier, sir,

18:31.920 --> 18:36.398
who sustained severe sabre wounds to
the head in the service of the King.

18:36.400 --> 18:39.438
I'm no lawyer, but I venture
to suggest that a man who has been

18:39.440 --> 18:42.998
bludgeoned across the skull might
not be entirely of sound mind.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.158
And if he's not of sound mind,

18:46.160 --> 18:48.358
how can he be held accountable
for his actions?

18:48.360 --> 18:49.878
Oh, come now...

18:49.880 --> 18:51.238
The man was a assassin.

18:51.240 --> 18:53.278
What you say intrigues me, sir.

18:53.280 --> 18:55.318
-And you are...?
-Thomas Erskine.

18:55.320 --> 18:56.440
Lawyer.

19:05.320 --> 19:07.838
I will prove that the world isn't
fit to receive the Lamb -

19:07.840 --> 19:08.918
I will prove it.

19:08.920 --> 19:11.158
Is this agitation usual for him?

19:11.160 --> 19:13.638
Countless testimonies say so.

19:13.640 --> 19:16.400
There is no other way.
I alone was chosen.

19:17.400 --> 19:21.118
I alone could herald the second
coming of the Lord.

19:21.120 --> 19:24.120
Remind me - the legal definition
of insanity...?

19:25.480 --> 19:29.918
The defendant must be lost to all
sense, incapable of forming

19:29.920 --> 19:33.838
a judgment upon the consequences of
the act he is about to commit.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.398
And his careful planning
of the assassination,

19:36.400 --> 19:39.358
the purchasing of pistols -
the lucid reasons given in advance -

19:39.360 --> 19:41.518
all seem to contradict such a claim.

19:41.520 --> 19:42.998
To die a martyr - for that...

19:43.000 --> 19:45.118
It is too much to ask?

19:45.120 --> 19:47.720
Would you consider taking the
stand in his defence?

19:50.280 --> 19:51.920
May I examine Mr Hadfield?

19:53.040 --> 19:54.080
Of course.

20:08.680 --> 20:10.160
Butter please, Jeremy.

20:12.360 --> 20:13.878
Clumsy!

20:13.880 --> 20:15.838
It's so squashed in here.

20:15.840 --> 20:18.158
I think perhaps we should think
about other lodgings.

20:18.160 --> 20:19.280
Absolutely not.

20:20.640 --> 20:21.838
Demelza enjoys a crush.

20:21.840 --> 20:24.118
When you've lived in one room with
a father and six brothers,

20:24.120 --> 20:25.478
anything is spacious.

20:28.800 --> 20:29.840
Thank you, sir.

20:39.960 --> 20:41.080
I must go out.

20:44.080 --> 20:45.518
I'll come with you. I need the air.

20:45.520 --> 20:47.438
No, no, it's a private matter.

20:47.440 --> 20:48.720
I won't be long.

21:06.520 --> 21:08.398
Mr Bannantine?

21:08.400 --> 21:09.440
Ross Poldark.

21:12.400 --> 21:14.558
How did you know I was seeking you?

21:14.560 --> 21:17.838
I have friends who frequent
certain inns,

21:17.840 --> 21:20.200
make it their business to see
and not be seen.

21:22.640 --> 21:25.958
As I have made it my business.

21:25.960 --> 21:32.078
So, you know that Ned - Colonel
Despard - has lately been released?

21:32.080 --> 21:34.558
Will you tell him it was not
indifference which kept me

21:34.560 --> 21:37.238
-away from his hearing?
-Of course, but...

21:37.240 --> 21:39.638
And if there's anything I can
now do to make amends...

21:39.640 --> 21:41.038
There is.

21:41.040 --> 21:42.240
Ned is free, but...

21:43.960 --> 21:45.118
..there was no trial,

21:45.120 --> 21:49.120
so there's still a cloud that hangs
over his reputation.

21:50.720 --> 21:53.198
I was hoping you could
help me dispel it.

21:53.200 --> 21:56.518
When Ned was governor in Honduras,

21:56.520 --> 22:00.558
as his secretary, you would have
observed him at close quarters.

22:00.560 --> 22:04.238
These accusations against him -
acting against the interests

22:04.240 --> 22:07.038
of the Crown - I'm assuming they
were without foundation?

22:07.040 --> 22:08.678
Utterly.

22:08.680 --> 22:10.238
So, what prompted them?

22:10.240 --> 22:13.918
Well, the Colonel could
be challenging, but...

22:13.920 --> 22:16.358
..his opposition to slavery?

22:16.360 --> 22:21.798
Housing, feeding, educating,
allocating land to slaves?

22:21.800 --> 22:24.438
Marrying one?

22:24.440 --> 22:27.438
The old colonists' and planters'
worst nightmare.

22:27.440 --> 22:32.438
Undermines the entire structure
on which their fortunes are founded.

22:32.440 --> 22:35.678
Would you be willing to
testify to this?

22:35.680 --> 22:39.078
Do you have any idea who Hanson's
associates are here in London?

22:39.080 --> 22:44.638
You must be aware, sir, that the
vested interests

22:44.640 --> 22:49.438
which have conspired to crucify
our friend... If I, or you,

22:49.440 --> 22:52.198
attempted to go against them...

22:52.200 --> 22:54.320
..you've no idea what they're
capable of.

22:56.720 --> 22:57.880
So, a wasted journey?

22:59.560 --> 23:02.000
What he told me would vindicate
Ned, but...

23:03.920 --> 23:06.638
..he'll never set it down,
for fear of reprisals.

23:06.640 --> 23:07.720
Will you tell Ned?

23:09.320 --> 23:10.560
What would be the point?

23:13.280 --> 23:14.680
Perhaps it's for the best.

23:16.160 --> 23:17.840
If such forces do exist...

23:20.480 --> 23:22.280
..is it not wise to avoid 'em?

23:32.400 --> 23:34.918
Ross...

23:34.920 --> 23:36.920
That man who bid you
spy for him...?

23:38.680 --> 23:39.838
Wickham?

23:39.840 --> 23:42.320
If nought's been heard, perhaps
he's forgot you.

23:43.320 --> 23:45.598
I seriously doubt it, Demelza.

23:45.600 --> 23:47.878
All the more reason for you
to keep your head down,

23:47.880 --> 23:50.798
keep clear of Ned's battles and
go about your business.

23:50.800 --> 23:51.960
My business is Ned.

23:53.160 --> 23:54.680
I am in his debt. You know that.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.280
What can you do for him?

24:00.920 --> 24:03.880
This is information which would
clear Ned Despard's name.

24:05.440 --> 24:07.478
I cannot get Bannantine to set it
down,

24:07.480 --> 24:12.238
but what he reports points to a conspiracy,
at the highest level, to silence and defame.

24:12.240 --> 24:14.358
The highest level.

24:14.360 --> 24:16.278
Which you would do well to avoid.

24:16.280 --> 24:18.198
But when a man's reputation
is at stake...

24:18.200 --> 24:21.238
Need I remind you, Captain, of
our present crisis?

24:21.240 --> 24:24.758
A populace on the verge of a revolt
every bit as bloody as that of France.

24:24.760 --> 24:27.518
-Mob violence. -But Ned is not...
-Attempts on the King's life...

24:27.520 --> 24:29.158
But Ned is not part of this
violence.

24:29.160 --> 24:31.118
It could be argued he's part
of a radical tide

24:31.120 --> 24:33.518
-which is threatening to swamp the nation.
-Who says so?

24:33.520 --> 24:36.480
Those whose greed and corruption
he threatened to expose?

24:38.160 --> 24:40.078
You'll forgive me, Captain.

24:40.080 --> 24:43.318
The Crown and I have more pressing
matters to attend to.

24:43.320 --> 24:46.118
Not least of which is your friend,
Doctor Enys, agreeing

24:46.120 --> 24:48.480
to take the stand for
James Hadfield.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.158
Good day.

25:09.160 --> 25:10.598
See?

25:10.600 --> 25:13.278
Not everyone's as vile as
they were at Vauxhall.

25:13.280 --> 25:15.840
That's because they think
I'm your maid.

25:33.480 --> 25:35.558
I told you.

25:35.560 --> 25:36.758
I'm invincible.

25:36.760 --> 25:38.278
Nephew?

25:38.280 --> 25:39.320
Aunt Demelza!

25:41.480 --> 25:43.158
May I introduce Miss Hanson?

25:43.160 --> 25:44.758
Ralph Hanson's daughter?

25:44.760 --> 25:46.158
My Aunt Demelza.

25:46.160 --> 25:48.358
We escaped my chaperone.

25:48.360 --> 25:49.598
You won't tell on us?

25:49.600 --> 25:53.118
Of course not!
Aunt Demelza's a regular sport.

25:53.120 --> 25:54.840
In truth, I feel a little uneasy.

25:56.240 --> 25:57.798
Without your parents' permission...

25:57.800 --> 26:01.398
My mother's dead and I care not
what my father thinks.

26:01.400 --> 26:04.600
Yet I think he'd not care to have
you gallivanting about together.

26:06.360 --> 26:08.398
We're but common acquaintances.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.120
Uncommon acquaintances.

26:12.080 --> 26:14.078
Will you not be our trusted friend?

26:14.080 --> 26:15.920
We'd esteem it the greatest favour.

26:18.760 --> 26:21.118
Very well. But be discreet.

26:21.120 --> 26:23.360
-Thank you!
-You're the best of aunts.

26:31.080 --> 26:32.120
Another game?

27:00.640 --> 27:03.438
Are you sure you're not wishing we
had the place to ourselves?

27:03.440 --> 27:04.480
No.

27:06.080 --> 27:07.120
Just...

27:10.120 --> 27:12.158
I keep thinking someone's
watching us.

27:12.160 --> 27:14.478
I know you'll say it's just
my imagination,

27:14.480 --> 27:17.638
and why would anyone wish
to follow us.

27:17.640 --> 27:19.640
It's as if I have any proof,
I just...

27:22.320 --> 27:23.600
I know I'm bein' foolish.

27:26.040 --> 27:28.558
Perhaps I should not have
asked you here.

27:28.560 --> 27:31.798
-Are you wishin' me gone already?
-No!

27:31.800 --> 27:35.598
I'm wishing London were not
so strange and so full of shadows.

27:35.600 --> 27:37.200
Is Cornwall not so, too?

27:38.760 --> 27:42.520
Indeed, is anywhere truly free
of those who wish us ill?

27:44.000 --> 27:46.558
And we do not even know
who they are.

27:46.560 --> 27:49.400
Then let us hold fast to those
we know we can trust.

27:52.240 --> 27:53.840
Then hold fast to me, my love.

28:21.960 --> 28:25.160
I know who it belong to -
but I think it suit me better.

28:26.600 --> 28:30.640
And tis maybe not the only thing
of hers sit better on me.

28:55.240 --> 28:57.718
What you have in that knapsack,
Samuel Carne?

28:57.720 --> 28:59.638
Slice o' my heavy cake?

28:59.640 --> 29:01.878
Back to yer hoein', Miss Impudent!

29:01.880 --> 29:03.720
Maybe we two should hoe together?

29:07.840 --> 29:09.078
Get off!

29:09.080 --> 29:10.120
Now!

29:19.400 --> 29:21.718
# There was an old couple
and they were poor

29:21.720 --> 29:24.318
# They lived in a house
with only one door

29:24.320 --> 29:27.678
# Oh, what a poor couple where they
where they

29:27.680 --> 29:28.920
# What a poor couple... #

30:01.360 --> 30:03.318
Is that...

30:03.320 --> 30:04.360
..Valentine?

30:08.760 --> 30:09.998
Valentine?

30:10.000 --> 30:11.040
Morwenna.

30:12.840 --> 30:14.438
Are you alone?

30:14.440 --> 30:15.720
Is your maid not with you?

30:17.480 --> 30:19.118
I escaped.

30:19.120 --> 30:20.558
What would your papa say?

30:20.560 --> 30:21.998
He's gone.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.760
-Where?
-To find Mama.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.318
But sweetheart...

30:30.320 --> 30:32.198
..your mama, she...

30:32.200 --> 30:33.600
Went away? Yes.

30:35.320 --> 30:37.160
And Papa told me he'd
bring her back.

30:38.760 --> 30:39.800
I...

30:42.520 --> 30:45.120
-I don't think he can have meant that, my love.
-He did.

30:46.720 --> 30:49.080
He promised me.
He will bring her back.

30:50.920 --> 30:52.640
Master Valentine!

30:54.880 --> 30:56.400
Where have you been?

31:21.600 --> 31:25.118
In the words of Governor
Colonel Edward Despard,

31:25.120 --> 31:28.558
"Man's inhumanity to man

31:28.560 --> 31:31.078
"manifests in its worst form
in the obscenity

31:31.080 --> 31:32.638
"which is the slave trade."

31:33.960 --> 31:35.198
Order!

31:35.200 --> 31:40.278
"Arguments in favour of slavery
are abominable

31:40.280 --> 31:43.400
"in the ingenuity of their
twisted reasoning."

31:46.400 --> 31:49.318
Colonel Despard has been alone
in his attempts to ease

31:49.320 --> 31:52.678
the plight of these men and women.
And how long...?

31:52.680 --> 31:55.678
How long will we turn
a blind eye

31:55.680 --> 31:57.880
to the suffering of these
poor souls?

32:00.120 --> 32:01.400
Order!

32:04.680 --> 32:05.880
This came for you.

32:24.520 --> 32:28.038
"Against my better judgment,
I have done as you asked.

32:28.040 --> 32:29.520
"Do not entreat me further".

32:31.240 --> 32:32.360
Bannantine?

32:40.920 --> 32:44.278
Ross, it says Ned was faultless in
his duty, devoted to his workers

32:44.280 --> 32:45.920
fiercely loyal to the Crown.

32:47.720 --> 32:49.438
Does he name Ned's accusers?

32:49.440 --> 32:50.480
He said he dared not.

32:52.280 --> 32:54.718
Then what can you do with it?

32:54.720 --> 32:56.120
Take it to Joseph Merceron.

32:57.280 --> 32:59.918
As presiding magistrate, he might
have means to make a public

32:59.920 --> 33:01.640
exoneration of Ned's character.

33:06.760 --> 33:08.758
Ross...

33:08.760 --> 33:11.838
..is it wise to take up Ned's
cause so publicly,

33:11.840 --> 33:13.398
with magistrates and the like?

33:13.400 --> 33:16.278
And Ned being so fiery, he's not
a man to hold his tongue.

33:16.280 --> 33:18.718
Perhaps...

33:18.720 --> 33:21.240
-..there is a better way.
-What?

33:22.680 --> 33:23.760
I will return later.

33:36.920 --> 33:38.278
Are you certain?

33:38.280 --> 33:39.758
I am resolved.

33:39.760 --> 33:42.078
The establishment will
not thank you.

33:42.080 --> 33:44.478
Mr Hadfield's wellbeing
is my concern,

33:44.480 --> 33:46.200
not spurious notions of justice.

34:15.440 --> 34:19.878
"Colonel Edward Despard -
A True And Impartial Account."

34:19.880 --> 34:21.318
And what will you do with them?

34:21.320 --> 34:25.277
Circulate them amongst MPs I deem
sympathetic to Ned's cause.

34:25.280 --> 34:26.480
Not that there are many!

34:29.560 --> 34:31.038
But I must begin somewhere.

34:31.040 --> 34:33.838
Ned, Dwight is due to
take the stand.

34:33.840 --> 34:35.960
This will put the cat amongst
the pigeons.

34:48.360 --> 34:50.199
Dr Dwight Enys to the stand.

35:02.720 --> 35:04.000
My Lord.

35:05.640 --> 35:08.118
We have heard the defendant
plead not guilty

35:08.120 --> 35:10.518
on the grounds of insanity.

35:10.520 --> 35:12.120
But how do we define insanity?

35:13.640 --> 35:17.518
As one who has treated many such
cases, I have observed

35:17.520 --> 35:20.798
that the true character of insanity
is not wild frenzy

35:20.800 --> 35:22.838
or raving madness,

35:22.840 --> 35:23.960
but delusion.

35:25.280 --> 35:28.078
I suggest, therefore, that if
a man's accountability

35:28.080 --> 35:30.158
rests upon his reason,

35:30.160 --> 35:34.398
then the loss of that reason
renders him not accountable.

35:36.280 --> 35:37.560
Order!

35:50.720 --> 35:52.358
James wrote this?

35:52.360 --> 35:54.158
Ross had 'em printed.

35:54.160 --> 35:57.838
He means to circulate 'em amongst
a few sympathetic MPs.

35:57.840 --> 35:59.120
But I have a better idea.

36:00.920 --> 36:03.878
The defendant served with
the Duke of York's bodyguard

36:03.880 --> 36:05.718
at the Battle of Tourcoing,

36:05.720 --> 36:08.158
where he sustained eight
sabre blows to the head,

36:08.160 --> 36:09.878
four of which are sufficient

36:09.880 --> 36:13.838
to cause permanent and irreversible
brain damage.

36:13.840 --> 36:15.798
It cannot escape the Court
that these injuries,

36:15.800 --> 36:19.278
which have deprived the defendant
of his reason,

36:19.280 --> 36:22.320
were sustained in the service
of the Crown itself.

36:23.680 --> 36:24.800
Order!

36:35.480 --> 36:36.600
Thank you, sir.

36:38.800 --> 36:39.918
Thank you very much.

36:39.920 --> 36:44.718
I have spoken with fellow officers,
who attest to the bravery

36:44.720 --> 36:47.478
and loyalty of the defendant
prior to his injuries.

36:47.480 --> 36:51.438
His sisters confirm this
marked transformation.

36:51.440 --> 36:52.558
His landlady...

36:52.560 --> 36:54.438
Are there many more examples?

36:54.440 --> 36:55.798
Yes, my Lord.

36:55.800 --> 36:58.480
At least 30 more have testified
in the same vein.

37:09.520 --> 37:14.798
Since it can no longer be doubted
that when the act was committed,

37:14.800 --> 37:18.078
the defendant was not of sound mind,

37:18.080 --> 37:21.798
the Court has no option
but to halt the trial

37:21.800 --> 37:26.078
and acquit the defendant on
the grounds of insanity.

37:26.080 --> 37:27.120
Thank you, My Lord.

37:28.680 --> 37:30.518
He is...

37:30.520 --> 37:34.198
He is, however, an extremely
dangerous

37:34.200 --> 37:41.160
member of society, who, for his own
sake, must not be discharged.

37:43.440 --> 37:44.920
All rise!

37:59.920 --> 38:03.038
If he's not to be released,
does that mean committal

38:03.040 --> 38:04.558
to an institution?

38:04.560 --> 38:06.238
Bedlam, I imagine.

38:06.240 --> 38:08.558
Then I'm sorry I intervened.

38:08.560 --> 38:10.320
Execution would have been kinder.

38:15.680 --> 38:17.478
Bannantine came forward, sir.

38:17.480 --> 38:20.918
-He agreed to share his evidence.
-Did he, indeed?

38:20.920 --> 38:22.920
Are you convinced by its veracity?

38:24.120 --> 38:26.118
Utterly.

38:26.120 --> 38:28.078
Do you think I should doubt it?

38:28.080 --> 38:30.920
In these uncertain times,
shouldn't we doubt everyone?

38:37.240 --> 38:40.038
Ralph Hanson and George Warleggan.

38:40.040 --> 38:43.278
What could they possibly
have in common?

38:43.280 --> 38:45.720
Perhaps I should give them
one of these.

38:50.720 --> 38:52.998
This is tremendous!

38:53.000 --> 38:54.040
Where did you...?

38:57.040 --> 38:58.798
Is Bannantine in London?

38:58.800 --> 39:00.518
Come with me.

39:00.520 --> 39:02.600
Let's see if this has the
effect I intend.

39:06.000 --> 39:10.118
Gentlemen, may I beg your indulgence

39:10.120 --> 39:13.518
and ask you to read
these pamphlets? Thank you.

39:13.520 --> 39:14.718
Though I say it myself...

39:14.720 --> 39:19.038
Mr Burdett, I believe this subject
will find sympathy with you, sir.

39:19.040 --> 39:20.120
Good day to you.

39:22.640 --> 39:24.558
Sir George!

39:24.560 --> 39:26.318
I observed you with Ralph Hanson.

39:26.320 --> 39:27.560
A new business venture?

39:30.920 --> 39:33.198
George, I wonder...?

39:33.200 --> 39:36.798
Geoffrey Charles is resolved
to serve his country

39:36.800 --> 39:39.798
as an officer - but that he cannot
do without sufficient means.

39:39.800 --> 39:41.638
I believe we've exhausted
this subject.

39:41.640 --> 39:44.038
Why would I wish to revisit it?

39:44.040 --> 39:46.720
Because we both know it's what
his mother would want.

39:49.400 --> 39:51.158
Oh.

39:51.160 --> 39:52.840
We both know, do we?

39:55.000 --> 39:57.198
What do you know of my wife?

39:57.200 --> 39:59.158
You were nothing to her.

39:59.160 --> 40:00.200
An irrelevance.

40:01.280 --> 40:02.560
And to me.

40:04.560 --> 40:06.958
So, that night, when you said,

40:06.960 --> 40:08.800
"See what we have brought her to..."

40:09.920 --> 40:11.840
What did you mean?

40:23.800 --> 40:27.440
That we had been the death of her.

40:28.880 --> 40:31.558
Between your inability
to let her go,

40:31.560 --> 40:36.520
and my unfounded suspicions,
we hounded her to an early grave.

40:39.760 --> 40:42.000
I take my share of the blame.
Take yours.

41:33.160 --> 41:34.200
Ambushed!

41:37.720 --> 41:39.000
Tears?

41:40.120 --> 41:41.880
Most unbecoming in a cadet.

41:49.480 --> 41:50.520
Your mama...

41:52.720 --> 41:54.680
I expect she was adorable.

41:57.080 --> 41:59.120
Would you like to see her picture?

42:10.400 --> 42:11.798
A beauty!

42:11.800 --> 42:13.678
Of course!

42:13.680 --> 42:16.280
How else would her son be Adonis?

42:26.360 --> 42:27.960
I'd almost forgot how to laugh.

42:29.440 --> 42:32.238
For months I've had no humour.

42:32.240 --> 42:33.878
No company.

42:33.880 --> 42:35.440
No purpose.

42:38.040 --> 42:40.400
What if I make it my mission
to entertain you?

42:41.920 --> 42:43.878
Then I should do the like for you!

42:43.880 --> 42:47.280
Are we not both motherless pups,
in need of diversion?

43:01.920 --> 43:03.958
Lord, what are we to do?

43:03.960 --> 43:06.638
Please don't tell me they've
formed an attachment.

43:06.640 --> 43:08.240
It will not end well, I fear.

43:09.680 --> 43:12.358
So, we nip this in the bud,
return to Cornwall,

43:12.360 --> 43:14.118
and take Geoffrey Charles with us.

43:14.120 --> 43:17.480
It will at least keep him away from
that odious man, Ralph Hanson.

43:19.480 --> 43:20.720
I pity his daughter.

43:28.920 --> 43:31.158
A momentous day!

43:31.160 --> 43:34.358
When our Empire spreads beyond
these shores to the very

43:34.360 --> 43:36.200
edges of the New World!

43:37.880 --> 43:39.880
Have you read this travesty?

43:41.440 --> 43:43.358
Glanced at it.

43:43.360 --> 43:46.038
It defames, without cause,

43:46.040 --> 43:50.158
certain persons - not by name,
but by implication -

43:50.160 --> 43:52.758
which could endanger their
interests in Honduras.

43:52.760 --> 43:53.800
And ours?

43:55.360 --> 43:57.198
Regrettably.

43:57.200 --> 43:58.598
Can anything be done?

43:58.600 --> 44:01.278
Well, the obvious route is
to discredit Despard,

44:01.280 --> 44:02.920
along with his friend, Poldark.

44:04.520 --> 44:06.318
Ross? Interesting. How?

44:06.320 --> 44:09.078
In the present climate,
not difficult.

44:09.080 --> 44:12.440
What the Crown fears above
all else is revolution.

44:13.640 --> 44:16.678
Poldark was present when Hadfield
tried to kill the King.

44:16.680 --> 44:18.158
But intervened to prevent it.

44:18.160 --> 44:19.878
Did he?

44:19.880 --> 44:22.800
Or was he merely there to cover up
his own involvement?

44:25.080 --> 44:29.118
Then, note how his friend, Enys,
helped to free the assassin.

44:29.120 --> 44:31.398
Well, the connections are
somewhat tenuous...

44:31.400 --> 44:34.518
Ah, but cleverly managed,

44:34.520 --> 44:37.438
they could create the impression...

44:37.440 --> 44:38.878
..of a conspiracy.

44:38.880 --> 44:44.798
Poldark, Despard, Enys - three men
with known Jacobin sympathies.

44:44.800 --> 44:47.838
Could be seen as hostile
to the Crown.

44:47.840 --> 44:49.080
Precisely, Sir George.

44:50.240 --> 44:51.960
But...

44:53.000 --> 44:54.640
..to more pleasant matters.

45:03.560 --> 45:08.158
Are you sure, George?
Is this really what you wish?

45:08.160 --> 45:09.560
Is it what I wish?

45:11.840 --> 45:14.878
-What?
-The investment is high, but so, I'm told, are the rewards.

45:14.880 --> 45:17.038
Oh, the rewards!

45:17.040 --> 45:19.678
Rewards are never guaranteed.

45:19.680 --> 45:22.798
And how well do you know this man?
Can he be trusted?

45:22.800 --> 45:24.598
Can he be trusted?

45:24.600 --> 45:25.838
Nephew...?

45:25.840 --> 45:28.798
My uncle will say we have proceeded
with all care and due diligence.

45:28.800 --> 45:30.318
Of whom are we speaking?

45:30.320 --> 45:32.238
But is this something Ross
would entertain?

45:32.240 --> 45:34.958
Do I care what Ross would entertain?
Have I not a mind of my own?

45:34.960 --> 45:36.758
Sir, I beg your indulgence,

45:36.760 --> 45:42.118
but I cannot allow my nephew
to sign this document.

45:42.120 --> 45:43.358
What...?

45:43.360 --> 45:47.478
Not being sufficiently confident
of the merits of the deal.

45:47.480 --> 45:48.878
Sir, I assure you...

45:48.880 --> 45:52.678
Sir George and I will confer and
report our decision in due course.

45:52.680 --> 45:53.720
Good day to you, sir.

46:06.680 --> 46:10.118
-Do we dine at home tonight?
-The Golden Hind, at Bedfont.

46:10.120 --> 46:12.878
We must hurry if we're to reach
Trenwith by Sunday.

46:12.880 --> 46:14.678
We're going to Trenwith?

46:14.680 --> 46:17.320
Ah! Is this not good news, my dear?

46:22.600 --> 46:24.120
Thank you for your kind words.

46:29.240 --> 46:30.960
Well done, Colonel. True patriot.

46:33.240 --> 46:36.038
We seem to be very popular
here today.

46:36.040 --> 46:37.518
Mission accomplished.

46:37.520 --> 46:38.840
Tomorrow, Honduras!

46:40.360 --> 46:43.878
Well, my dears, let the gentlemen
have their small victories!

46:43.880 --> 46:47.078
For today, it was we ladies
who made the difference!

46:47.080 --> 46:49.558
I leave tomorrow.
My credit has run out.

46:49.560 --> 46:51.238
Returning to Cornwall?

46:51.240 --> 46:53.158
How dismal!

46:53.160 --> 46:54.880
-Will you miss me?
-Not in the least!

46:56.240 --> 46:57.320
Nor I you.

47:00.600 --> 47:02.518
So, the pamphlets were a triumph.

47:02.520 --> 47:04.838
And there was I, thinking you
might not approve!

47:04.840 --> 47:08.080
Well, in truth, I was not
altogether convinced.

47:09.800 --> 47:11.160
And then I bethought me...

47:12.440 --> 47:14.760
..what is a marriage if we
stand not together?

47:16.360 --> 47:19.438
Must I not trust your judgment,
as you must trust mine?

47:19.440 --> 47:22.438
I admit, even did not dare to hope

47:22.440 --> 47:26.478
-for such a rapid and widespread response.
-Yes.

47:26.480 --> 47:28.320
I may have had a hand in that.

47:29.440 --> 47:30.718
Oh?

47:30.720 --> 47:35.798
I may have given out a few
pamphlets at Hyde Park -

47:35.800 --> 47:38.280
and encouraged Kitty and Caroline
to do the like.

47:41.640 --> 47:42.680
Did I do wrong?

47:43.680 --> 47:46.718
Ross, I only thought that the more
folk who know the truth, the better.

47:46.720 --> 47:47.760
Yes, but...

47:49.320 --> 47:54.918
..a discreet circulation to
sympathetic colleagues is one thing.

47:54.920 --> 47:57.238
A wholesale papering of all
of London, it...

47:57.240 --> 47:58.638
What?

47:58.640 --> 48:00.758
It does leave the Government
with nowhere to hide.

48:00.760 --> 48:04.040
Do it need to hide?
Ought it to?

48:06.800 --> 48:08.280
You're right, my love.

48:09.640 --> 48:11.280
It deserves to be exposed.

48:12.840 --> 48:15.678
And whatever consequences
there may be...

48:15.680 --> 48:16.720
Will there be?

48:19.400 --> 48:20.600
Probably not.

48:34.080 --> 48:36.600
Come.

48:39.400 --> 48:40.440
You wished to see me.

48:46.400 --> 48:50.838
So, Ned Despard has been
repositioned as the heroic victim

48:50.840 --> 48:52.358
of a vile conspiracy.

48:52.360 --> 48:55.118
He is the victim of a vile
conspiracy!

48:55.120 --> 48:57.238
Take care you do not become
embroiled in one.

48:57.240 --> 48:59.558
-I?
-Since your reconnection with Despard,

48:59.560 --> 49:03.718
you've begun to associate with other
Jacobins - Despard's wife,

49:03.720 --> 49:06.598
-the assassin who tried to kill the king...
-The man I disarmed?

49:06.600 --> 49:09.758
And now your friend, Enys, is the
scourge of the Attorney General.

49:09.760 --> 49:13.078
In isolation, these connections
would not be troubling.

49:13.080 --> 49:15.958
Put them together and
a pattern emerges.

49:15.960 --> 49:18.400
I've done nothing to merit
mistrust of any kind.

49:22.600 --> 49:23.640
Except for this.

49:25.280 --> 49:28.518
Had you been patient, Despard
may have returned to his post.

49:28.520 --> 49:30.798
Your intervention has done
the very thing

49:30.800 --> 49:32.078
the Government wished to avoid -

49:32.080 --> 49:34.278
it's drawn attention to an
unfortunate situation.

49:34.280 --> 49:35.518
A miscarriage of justice.

49:35.520 --> 49:38.638
Which has embarrassed the Crown
and its ministers.

49:38.640 --> 49:41.000
Now, the Crown requires you
to make amends.

49:46.240 --> 49:48.440
At least, they do not
specifically name me.

49:49.680 --> 49:53.958
Though anyone familiar with my
methods would guess at its target.

49:53.960 --> 49:56.398
But Despard could not know
for certain

49:56.400 --> 49:58.520
who led the campaign for his recall.

50:00.600 --> 50:02.920
Bannantine should pay
for this treachery.

50:11.560 --> 50:12.880
Spy on Ned and Kitty?

50:18.200 --> 50:19.798
Can you refuse?

50:19.800 --> 50:22.720
I can remove us from this place
and take us all to Cornwall.

50:24.560 --> 50:26.518
Will you tell Ned what
you've been asked?

50:26.520 --> 50:28.038
Why would I?

50:28.040 --> 50:29.560
I've no intention of doing it.

50:30.720 --> 50:34.198
-Dear Lord, Ross...
-We're going home. Are you not glad?

50:34.200 --> 50:36.278
Of course - but like this?
Under such a threat?

50:36.280 --> 50:38.600
There'll be no threat
once we're in Cornwall.

50:43.120 --> 50:45.638
Cecily, I have a journey to make.

50:45.640 --> 50:47.838
I'm leaving for Cornwall.

50:47.840 --> 50:49.600
You will accompany me.

50:51.040 --> 50:53.320
Pray, do not trouble me with
your objections.

50:56.200 --> 50:57.680
I would not dream of it, Papa.

51:09.080 --> 51:11.800
A few weeks of Cornish air will
do us all the power of good.

51:42.200 --> 51:44.918
Ah, Valentine!

51:44.920 --> 51:46.680
Look who I've brought home with me.

52:28.840 --> 52:31.838
When I saw you that day,

52:31.840 --> 52:33.200
with young Valentine...

52:36.400 --> 52:39.840
..seeing you comfort and
talk to him...

52:42.560 --> 52:46.798
..made me desire to have you comfort
and talk to a child of our own.

52:46.800 --> 52:47.918
Drake...

52:47.920 --> 52:50.520
And maybe that day will never come.

52:54.120 --> 52:55.878
But dare we not hope?

52:55.880 --> 52:58.438
If something is broken
beyond recall...

52:58.440 --> 52:59.480
But is it?

53:02.320 --> 53:03.600
Truly?

53:05.800 --> 53:06.920
Beyond recall?

53:39.560 --> 53:41.078
Mama, I'm starving!

53:41.080 --> 53:43.678
So you've said, my love - every five
minutes since we left Plymouth.

53:43.680 --> 53:44.998
Shall we see if they have any cake

53:45.000 --> 53:47.118
-while we wait for the horses to be changed?
-Yes, please!

53:47.120 --> 53:48.520
Go on, go and sit down there.

53:53.120 --> 53:54.918
Miss Hanson?

53:54.920 --> 53:56.640
A welcome surprise.

54:09.840 --> 54:11.158
Easy, boy.

54:11.160 --> 54:14.398
Let's not treat our fellow diners
to displays of martial arts.

54:14.400 --> 54:15.718
No, indeed.

54:15.720 --> 54:17.840
A cup of tea would be far
less distractin'.

54:21.160 --> 54:23.000
Are you staying in Truro, sir?

54:24.360 --> 54:25.998
Yes, I am.

54:26.000 --> 54:30.680
Well, perhaps you'd appreciate some
reading matter for the evening.

54:37.480 --> 54:38.920
Cecily, go to your room.

54:41.000 --> 54:42.040
Yes, Papa.

54:43.480 --> 54:46.160
"A True And Honest Account
by James Bannantine."

55:11.400 --> 55:12.800
Mr Bannantine?

55:24.480 --> 55:25.560
Is she here?

55:27.080 --> 55:29.038
She said she'd be here.
She promised.

55:29.040 --> 55:31.678
Sit, nephew - take some refreshment.

55:31.680 --> 55:33.358
But where is she?

55:33.360 --> 55:35.718
She'll, er, she'll be
here presently.

55:35.720 --> 55:38.440
-But she did say so?
-Yes. She said so.

55:40.960 --> 55:43.720
Ah, there she is!

55:45.640 --> 55:47.678
My dear, would you take
a little port?

55:47.680 --> 55:49.678
Thank you, my dear.

55:49.680 --> 55:51.360
How good it is to be home again.

56:38.000 --> 56:39.398
Are you happy now?

56:39.400 --> 56:41.160
With our feet back on Cornish soil.

56:42.360 --> 56:43.760
All's right in the world.

56:58.000 --> 56:59.998
London cannot touch us.

57:00.000 --> 57:01.478
No.

57:01.480 --> 57:02.520
It cannot.

57:06.520 --> 57:08.878
Accident! Accident at Wheal Plenty!

57:08.880 --> 57:11.238
Up to 20 miners missing -
some of them children.

57:11.240 --> 57:13.278
For a man of Sir George's
stubbornness,

57:13.280 --> 57:15.718
a more robust approach
is required.

57:15.720 --> 57:19.678
I see no reason to account to you
for the welfare of my grandson.

57:19.680 --> 57:22.518
-Clear the way!
-No! No! Ned!

57:22.520 --> 57:25.480
Is it not a slave's duty to
perform as directed?

57:28.680 --> 57:30.120
Where did you get that?

57:33.186 --> 57:38.186
