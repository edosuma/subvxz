WEBVTT

00:04.588 --> 00:06.130
How's he taking it?

00:07.758 --> 00:09.050
As you'd expect.

00:09.134 --> 00:10.593
We both knew
Ezra might not get the news

00:10.678 --> 00:12.095
he hoped he would about his parents.

00:14.264 --> 00:17.975
Governor Azadi, we're grateful
you stood by them for so long.

00:18.060 --> 00:19.519
Not sure what good it did.

00:19.603 --> 00:22.146
Things don't seem
any better here on Lothal.

00:22.231 --> 00:23.648
At the moment, maybe,

00:23.732 --> 00:25.858
but we hope to
change that in the future.

00:25.943 --> 00:29.987
Speaking of which, Senator Organa
heard about our losses on Garel.

00:30.072 --> 00:31.948
He's sending us reinforcements.

00:32.032 --> 00:35.910
His agent is coming
to Lothal with three cruisers.

00:35.994 --> 00:38.746
Three cruisers? That is good news.

00:38.831 --> 00:41.457
Maybe a mission like this
is just what Ezra needs.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.209
I hope you're right.

00:43.293 --> 00:46.003
We'll be there
as soon as we can to help.

01:01.353 --> 01:04.731
Sir, three unidentified starships
have just entered our sector.

01:04.815 --> 01:06.941
Launch fighters to intercept.

01:09.611 --> 01:11.070
Open a channel.

01:11.155 --> 01:13.322
Attention. This is Lieutenant Lyste.

01:13.407 --> 01:16.743
Lothal is now a restricted system
by order of the Emperor.

01:16.827 --> 01:18.536
Identify yourselves immediately.

01:18.620 --> 01:19.746
Greetings, Lieutenant.

01:19.830 --> 01:22.832
We come bearing relief supplies
for the citizens of Lothal.

01:22.916 --> 01:25.752
Our mission is sanctioned
by the Imperial Senate.

01:25.836 --> 01:29.714
I wasn't informed of your visit,
nor do you have a landing permit.

01:29.798 --> 01:33.092
-Permit's coming through now, sir.
-They're from Alderaan.

01:34.178 --> 01:37.513
Another meddling delegation
from Alderaan.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.515
I'll handle this personally.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.479
Attention, senatorial convoy.

01:44.563 --> 01:45.772
Your landing has been granted,

01:45.856 --> 01:49.358
and fighters will escort you
to the Jalath City Depot for processing.

01:49.443 --> 01:50.943
I'll see you there.

01:51.028 --> 01:54.489
This is Princess Leia Organa.
I look forward to it, Lieutenant.

01:54.573 --> 01:56.741
End transmission.

01:56.825 --> 01:59.952
Well, there's no turning back now.

02:12.758 --> 02:14.675
Ezra, we're gonna miss
our rendezvous.

02:14.760 --> 02:15.968
Let's go.

02:16.053 --> 02:18.387
lf you're going into Jalath City,
be careful.

02:18.472 --> 02:19.639
The fleet may be gone,

02:19.723 --> 02:21.891
but Imperial Security
is bound to recognize you.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.684
Maybe dressed like this.

02:23.894 --> 02:26.771
But who's gonna notice
an extra stormtrooper and cadet?

02:28.148 --> 02:29.357
Great.

02:34.112 --> 02:37.323
They know our ship, too.
Ryder, any chance we could...

02:37.407 --> 02:39.826
Borrow my bike? Take it.

02:39.910 --> 02:41.661
But I'm not getting involved any further.

02:41.745 --> 02:43.704
Even after what the Empire did to you?

02:43.789 --> 02:45.581
Come on, get back in the fight.

02:45.666 --> 02:49.669
I won't go back to prison, Kanan.
Please don't ask that of me.

03:05.519 --> 03:08.813
Those are our reinforcements?
Some old transports?

03:08.897 --> 03:11.482
ln our position,
you take what you can get, kid.

03:26.623 --> 03:29.041
Hey, excuse me, miss.
Where's your commander?

03:29.126 --> 03:30.751
Not much of a welcoming committee.

03:30.836 --> 03:32.295
Trooper?

03:32.379 --> 03:35.131
I'm Kanan. This is Ezra.
We're from Phoenix Squadron.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.716
I know who you are.

03:36.800 --> 03:39.051
And unless you want
the deck officer to know, too,

03:39.136 --> 03:42.513
I suggest you put your helmets back on
and keep your mouths shut.

03:42.598 --> 03:44.140
Excuse me?

03:44.683 --> 03:46.684
You heard her. Shut it.

03:47.603 --> 03:50.563
Deck Officer, I'd like to start
distributing my relief aid.

03:50.647 --> 03:51.772
Stand by.

03:51.857 --> 03:53.941
My orders are to inspect
the cargo for contraband,

03:54.026 --> 03:57.236
and detain these vessels
until the lieutenant arrives.

03:57.321 --> 03:59.280
Scanning crew, move out.

04:02.868 --> 04:04.785
Well, this plan's off to a good start.

04:04.870 --> 04:06.996
As a matter of fact, it's going perfectly.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.999
-Where's the rest of your team?
-They'll be here, eventually.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.084
Good. Then you can steal my ships.

04:12.169 --> 04:13.210
-What?
-What?

04:18.508 --> 04:21.010
I'll explain later.
First I have to deal with the lieutenant.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.429
-Follow my lead and try and keep up.
-Wait.

04:23.513 --> 04:24.972
Why does she get to give orders?

04:25.057 --> 04:26.641
I don't get to give orders.

04:26.725 --> 04:28.976
Do you ever listen to yourself?

04:29.061 --> 04:31.729
Yes, and I happen to be
very interesting.

04:32.564 --> 04:36.484
You must be Leia Organa, Princess
of the Royal House of Alderaan.

04:36.568 --> 04:39.278
And aide to my father,
Senator Bail Organa.

04:39.363 --> 04:41.572
I come with relief supplies
for Lothal's needy,

04:41.657 --> 04:44.909
who are suffering terribly
as a result of the rebel insurgency here.

04:44.993 --> 04:47.161
Surely you don't want
innocents to starve.

04:47.245 --> 04:48.621
No, of course not.

04:48.705 --> 04:51.958
Lothal has indeed suffered,
as has Alderaan.

04:52.042 --> 04:53.209
From what I hear,

04:53.293 --> 04:56.754
your ships have an unfortunate habit
of falling into rebel hands.

04:56.838 --> 04:59.799
I assure you,
that won't happen on my watch.

05:01.885 --> 05:03.552
What's that?

05:09.643 --> 05:12.770
Gravity locks? This is hardly necessary.

05:13.188 --> 05:14.522
I insist.

05:14.606 --> 05:17.900
Plus a trooper detachment,
and for extra security...

05:25.575 --> 05:29.662
Walkers will guard your ships
from the rebel insurgency.

05:29.746 --> 05:31.497
All for your safety, miss.

05:31.581 --> 05:32.999
It's "Your Highness."

05:33.083 --> 05:34.250
As my ships are detained,

05:34.334 --> 05:36.836
I will require your shuttle
to begin my work.

05:37.671 --> 05:38.921
My shuttle?

05:39.006 --> 05:41.424
Certainly I could arrange
for other transportation.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.426
No. Your shuttle.

05:43.510 --> 05:44.969
I need to leave immediately.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.054
You two, bring those supplies

05:47.139 --> 05:49.265
and escort me
to the trauma area at once.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.100
Yes, ma'am. Right away.

06:06.158 --> 06:08.242
I hate to say it,
but whoever came up with this plan

06:08.326 --> 06:11.537
severely underestimated
the Empire's security.

06:11.621 --> 06:13.372
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be.

06:13.457 --> 06:14.665
It's not your fault.

06:14.750 --> 06:17.501
Yes, it is. This was my plan.

06:17.586 --> 06:19.170
We need those ships.

06:19.254 --> 06:21.881
Why didn't you just
hand them off to us in deep space?

06:21.965 --> 06:24.508
You don't understand.
It's not that simple.

06:24.593 --> 06:27.803
lf the Empire could prove Alderaan
provided ships to the rebels,

06:27.888 --> 06:31.390
we'd lose our seat in the Senate
and be charged with treason.

06:31.475 --> 06:34.310
But if they're stolen
on a planet controlled by the Empire...

06:34.394 --> 06:36.812
Alderaan would be blameless.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.898
Have to admit, that was a good plan.

06:38.982 --> 06:41.150
Well, now we need a new one.

06:42.402 --> 06:43.694
Yeah, what is it, Chopper?

06:45.614 --> 06:46.822
Stormtroopers?

07:02.172 --> 07:03.589
Friends of yours?

07:03.673 --> 07:05.758
Not for much longer,
by the look of things.

07:05.842 --> 07:07.426
What are we going to do?

07:07.511 --> 07:09.887
This time, you follow my lead.

07:20.899 --> 07:23.400
This is a secure site.
State your business.

07:23.527 --> 07:26.362
I'm taking
the princes-ambassador here

07:26.446 --> 07:29.323
on a scouting mission
for possible refugee relocation.

07:29.407 --> 07:31.408
This is not a safe area for you.

07:31.493 --> 07:34.036
There's a high level of rebel activity
happening at the moment.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.454
Well, we're finishing our survey.

07:35.539 --> 07:38.165
We could take these prisoners
back to Jalath for you.

07:38.250 --> 07:39.458
That won't be necessary.

07:39.543 --> 07:42.336
We have orders
to terminate one of them immediately.

07:46.842 --> 07:47.842
Hold on, trooper.

07:47.926 --> 07:49.468
As a representative of the Senate,

07:49.553 --> 07:51.303
I demand to know
what this man has done.

07:51.388 --> 07:53.722
He's a fugitive from an Imperial prison.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.183
Now, depart immediately
for your own safety.

07:56.268 --> 07:58.769
Where you find one rebel,
there are usually more.

08:02.065 --> 08:03.816
Chopper's receiving a signal.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.359
You know what that means.

08:05.443 --> 08:06.735
Hera's here.

08:12.784 --> 08:15.744
-More friends of yours?
-Yeah, I'm a likable guy.

08:17.414 --> 08:18.998
You're coming with me!

08:26.047 --> 08:28.174
No, you can't come on board!

08:28.258 --> 08:30.259
You have to go get The Phantom.
Get moving!

08:34.848 --> 08:36.849
Your friends might shoot you
wearing that armor.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.642
That's not a bad idea, Governor.

08:38.727 --> 08:40.686
-Take the princess hostage.
-What?

08:40.770 --> 08:43.355
lf I'm seen escaping with you,
I'll be labeled a traitor.

08:43.440 --> 08:44.982
You have to take me prisoner.

08:45.066 --> 08:47.776
Well, you better make it look good.
I'll warn Sabine.

08:49.112 --> 08:50.529
We got two incoming.

08:50.614 --> 08:54.033
-What about Ezra and Kanan?
-They're the troopers on the left.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.245
Help! Help! Commander!

08:59.247 --> 09:01.582
Hold your fire! She's my responsibility!

09:01.666 --> 09:03.375
I'll get her back!

09:03.460 --> 09:06.503
Kanan's coming.
He said to make it look good.

09:08.632 --> 09:10.925
-No, Zeb, wait! Easy!
-That's Kanan!

09:11.801 --> 09:13.302
I know.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.808
-They're taking prisoners?
-They do that now?

09:32.322 --> 09:33.822
Kanan. Wake up!

09:34.157 --> 09:36.450
Kanan! How's your face?

09:36.534 --> 09:38.869
Why did you hit me?

09:38.954 --> 09:40.454
What? You had a helmet on.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.374
Did you have to hit us so hard?

09:43.458 --> 09:44.833
Hey, you wanted it to look good.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.126
Where's the princess?

09:46.711 --> 09:48.379
ln the cockpit with Hera.

09:49.673 --> 09:51.298
We've completed our search
of the transports

09:51.383 --> 09:52.883
and found no contraband.

09:52.968 --> 09:54.718
Very well, Corporal.

09:55.553 --> 09:56.595
Yes?

09:56.680 --> 09:58.973
Sir, my squad was ambushed
by rebels.

09:59.057 --> 10:01.267
They escaped with
the fugitive Ryder Azadi.

10:01.351 --> 10:03.811
-What?
-They also abducted a cadet.

10:03.895 --> 10:05.604
And some princess-ambassador.

10:05.689 --> 10:07.773
She's under our protection.

10:07.857 --> 10:10.150
Deploy search patrols, now!

10:15.865 --> 10:18.742
I owe you my life.
You have my gratitude.

10:18.827 --> 10:21.996
It's the least we could do
after leading the Empire right to you.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.623
We heard what happened. Sorry, kid.

10:24.708 --> 10:27.334
Hey, at least now you know.

10:27.711 --> 10:31.005
Yeah. I guess I just need some time.

10:41.182 --> 10:43.517
-ls he all right?
-He's okay.

10:43.601 --> 10:45.853
He just lost some people close to him.

10:48.023 --> 10:51.608
It's a challenge being his age
with so much responsibility.

10:52.235 --> 10:54.236
I know that feeling.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.905
Maybe he could use a friend.

11:22.307 --> 11:24.141
I know who you are.

11:26.770 --> 11:30.522
You're Ezra Bridger.
I heard your transmission.

11:30.607 --> 11:33.233
Yeah? My parents heard it, too.

11:33.318 --> 11:34.693
But they're gone now.

11:35.487 --> 11:36.820
I'm sorry.

11:37.947 --> 11:41.784
It's just there's so much against us.

11:41.910 --> 11:43.494
Do you ever wonder...

11:43.578 --> 11:46.413
lf this fight is even worth it?

11:46.498 --> 11:48.290
Every day.

11:48.375 --> 11:49.792
But I'm still here.

11:49.876 --> 11:51.293
But you're a princess.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.629
You don't have to
risk your life doing this.

11:53.713 --> 11:58.509
I feel like because I can fight,
I have to for those who cannot.

11:58.885 --> 12:01.178
And I think you might be the same way.

12:14.484 --> 12:17.319
Let's figure out a way to get your ships.

12:22.992 --> 12:26.537
We did a scan of the landing field,
and looking at the Imperial security,

12:26.621 --> 12:30.416
I just don't see us living long enough
to get near those ships.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.751
Two walkers are a big problem.

12:33.795 --> 12:35.087
Even if we reach the ships,

12:35.171 --> 12:38.090
they're not going anywhere
until we can disable those gravity locks.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.676
Those defenses are formidable.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.261
Why?

12:42.345 --> 12:44.763
Because the Empire
doesn't underestimate you.

12:44.848 --> 12:46.598
They know how good you are.

12:46.683 --> 12:49.476
We might be able to get one out,
but we'll never get all three.

12:49.561 --> 12:51.228
It's impossible.

12:58.695 --> 13:02.364
I know you need those ships,
so don't tell me why we can't get them.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.366
Tell me how we will.

13:04.451 --> 13:07.119
Well, Kanan and I
still have our disguises,

13:07.203 --> 13:09.413
so we can get onto the platform.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.832
But to get close to the ships,
we'll need a distraction.

13:11.916 --> 13:15.377
-I can handle that.
-The Ghost can act as air support.

13:15.462 --> 13:18.464
And I can use detonators
to blast off the gravity locks.

13:18.548 --> 13:19.798
Won't work.

13:19.883 --> 13:22.801
You can't forcibly remove the locks.

13:22.886 --> 13:24.219
You know this how?

13:24.304 --> 13:28.223
ln prison I put those locks together,
so I know how to take 'em apart.

13:28.308 --> 13:31.143
Ryder Azadi,
does that mean you're getting involved?

13:31.227 --> 13:32.728
Just this once.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.396
It's clear I can't stay on Lothal,

13:34.481 --> 13:38.525
so I'll help you,
if you get me outta here.

13:40.570 --> 13:41.904
Over there.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.290
This is the rebel ship
we've been looking for.

13:53.374 --> 13:55.125
Set weapons for stun.

14:00.256 --> 14:03.258
I'd think you'd be pleased
to see me safe and sound, Lieutenant.

14:03.343 --> 14:06.803
Of course, Your Highness.
Very pleased.

14:06.888 --> 14:09.932
Just surprised.

14:13.269 --> 14:15.145
We need to cut open that access panel,

14:15.230 --> 14:17.689
and bypass
the primary power flux coupling.

14:17.774 --> 14:18.941
Hurry.

14:20.944 --> 14:23.987
This brave trooper
saved us both from those rebels.

14:24.072 --> 14:25.697
He deserves a medal.

14:27.158 --> 14:28.242
We did it!

14:28.326 --> 14:31.703
Sabine, you take this one.
We'll move on to the next ship.

14:31.788 --> 14:33.789
I'll call in the air support.

14:42.507 --> 14:46.552
As you can see, your ships are safe
and sound right where you left them.

14:46.636 --> 14:48.679
lf you're trying to
impress me, Lieutenant,

14:48.763 --> 14:50.806
you're doing a miserable job of it.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.808
-What do you mean?
-You don't know?

14:52.892 --> 14:55.894
I didn't authorize this!
Who's piloting that ship?

14:57.021 --> 14:59.147
-Sir! Rebels!
-Blast them!

15:55.955 --> 15:59.416
Sabine's away. Let's get outta here.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.543
I'm not sure we're going anywhere.

16:23.191 --> 16:25.484
Secure the third ship.
I'll handle the walker.

16:25.568 --> 16:27.277
Handle the walker? How?

16:27.362 --> 16:29.738
Just trust us. Go!

16:40.124 --> 16:42.084
Unlock that ship!

16:44.128 --> 16:45.420
He's a Jedi!

16:47.965 --> 16:49.257
Look! What's that?

16:50.259 --> 16:52.260
I don't think he's on our side.

17:15.201 --> 17:16.368
Did you see that?

17:16.452 --> 17:18.537
lf you like that, watch this.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.455
Drop your weapons.

17:27.880 --> 17:28.964
Get down!

17:33.636 --> 17:34.970
That is impressive.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.847
Well, mostly.

17:38.641 --> 17:40.142
She's all yours, Kanan.

17:40.226 --> 17:42.227
Two down, one to go.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.696
I'll handle this.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.074
Thank goodness you've arrived.

17:56.159 --> 17:58.160
The rebels are stealing my ships.

18:04.083 --> 18:07.252
AT-AT 36,
you have new orders, shoot to kill.

18:07.336 --> 18:09.713
-Repeat, shoot to kill.
-No, you can't!

18:09.797 --> 18:10.797
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

18:10.882 --> 18:12.883
We can't let your ships
fall into rebel hands.

18:12.967 --> 18:14.551
Destroy that ship now!

18:22.477 --> 18:24.102
Did I get it this time?

18:24.187 --> 18:26.855
Finish up here. I have to help them.

19:32.088 --> 19:33.421
Time for me to go.

19:37.927 --> 19:39.886
-Wait. What are you doing?
-Stop that rebel!

19:39.971 --> 19:41.847
He's stealing my transport!

19:41.931 --> 19:43.348
Make it look good.

19:43.432 --> 19:45.892
We gotta make this look good.

19:45.977 --> 19:47.561
You have my permission.

19:47.645 --> 19:49.312
See you later, Princess.

19:51.566 --> 19:52.732
The princess!

20:06.497 --> 20:10.125
My ships. You lost my ships.

20:10.918 --> 20:12.794
I'm afraid so.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.462
You should be afraid!

20:14.547 --> 20:15.922
Just wait until I tell the Senate

20:16.007 --> 20:19.801
that the Imperial presence on Lothal
is helpless against the rebels.

20:19.886 --> 20:22.137
No, no, no. That won't be necessary.

20:22.221 --> 20:25.599
I assure you, Alderaan will be fully
compensated for your lost ships.

20:25.683 --> 20:26.892
Fine.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.519
And I'll need your shuttle
so I can return home.

20:29.604 --> 20:32.480
My shuttle. Right.

20:33.441 --> 20:34.566
Where is it?

20:34.650 --> 20:37.402
Lieutenant, did you lose your ship, too?

20:37.486 --> 20:39.321
I'll summon you another right away.

20:51.792 --> 20:55.253
So, Governor,
we need to find a safe place for you.

20:55.338 --> 20:58.423
I already know where I'm going,
back home.

20:58.507 --> 21:00.675
I knew you'd come around.

21:01.177 --> 21:02.469
I couldn't see it before,

21:02.553 --> 21:05.388
but going to prison
with the Bridgers started something.

21:05.473 --> 21:08.308
That something has grown bigger
than I ever imagined.

21:08.893 --> 21:12.938
I owe it to them and I owe it to you
to see it through to the end.

21:18.319 --> 21:20.862
Welcome back to the fight, Governor.
