00:12.838 --> 00:15.623
Deidre.

00:15.624 --> 00:17.515
Honey...?

00:19.209 --> 00:20.681
Can we go now?

00:20.682 --> 00:22.442
I'm dying here.

00:22.443 --> 00:24.363
What?

00:24.364 --> 00:26.988
I thought we were gonna see
mummies and shrunken heads.

00:26.989 --> 00:29.134
If I see one more
urn, I'm gonna lose it.

00:29.135 --> 00:31.346
Broaden your horizons, Barry.

00:34.098 --> 00:35.953
So painted wood statues were common

00:35.954 --> 00:38.643
during all dynasties of the old kingdom.

00:38.644 --> 00:40.852
This decorative urn
from the 13th century

00:40.853 --> 00:43.542
was from Pharaoh Akhenaten
to his first wife...

00:43.543 --> 00:45.726
But you're not really
interested in any of this,

00:45.727 --> 00:47.063
are you, Barry?

00:47.064 --> 00:49.336
What the... What the hell?

00:49.337 --> 00:51.065
Hey, honey, you're not gonna
believe this. This thing just...

00:51.066 --> 00:52.689
Go through the door on your right,

00:52.690 --> 00:55.381
if you want to see
something really interesting.

00:56.189 --> 00:58.688
Okay, I guess.

01:11.173 --> 01:14.182
Yes, keep going.

01:14.183 --> 01:16.422
To the right.

01:16.423 --> 01:18.216
Almost there.

01:20.426 --> 01:22.861
In the center of the room.

01:26.028 --> 01:29.424
All right. That's more like it.

02:09.884 --> 02:17.790
<font color="#33FF00">Subtitle sync and corrections by
<b>awaqeded</b> for <b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

02:39.828 --> 02:41.876
Flynn, how we doin'?

02:41.877 --> 02:44.469
Don't know how long I
can hold these goat heads.

02:44.470 --> 02:46.358
I'm climbing, I'm climbing.

02:46.359 --> 02:48.503
And technically, it's a ram's head.

02:48.504 --> 02:50.968
Interesting fact, the ram's head

02:50.969 --> 02:52.569
is a Druid symbol of power and virility.

02:52.593 --> 02:55.394
More interesting fact,
Druids are trying to kill us.

02:57.117 --> 02:59.292
- I need those translations.
- Give me a second!

02:59.293 --> 03:01.213
- Okay.
- It's, um...

03:01.214 --> 03:02.942
Looks like ancient Gaulish

03:02.943 --> 03:05.344
mixed with third-century
astrological symbols.

03:05.345 --> 03:06.657
Ezekiel! Please tell me

03:06.658 --> 03:08.514
you're working on an escape plan!

03:08.515 --> 03:11.651
Uh, way ahead of you, as always.

03:18.888 --> 03:21.321
The entrance appears to
be blocked by a board game.

03:21.322 --> 03:22.793
All right, all right, all right.

03:22.794 --> 03:25.515
The markings read,
"North... northern king..."

03:25.516 --> 03:27.692
No. "The King... when the
king reaches the north,

03:27.693 --> 03:29.517
the light will reveal itself."

03:29.518 --> 03:32.014
- Ah! Gwyddbwyll!
- Oh, my God. He's having a stroke.

03:32.015 --> 03:33.551
No, no. Gwyddbwyll.

03:33.552 --> 03:36.176
Ancient Celtic precursor
to chess, actually.

03:36.177 --> 03:38.097
Seven-by-seven grid, 21 pieces,

03:38.098 --> 03:41.395
72,804 possible moves...

03:43.093 --> 03:46.553
Uh... 72,803 possible moves.

03:48.247 --> 03:49.751
Okay, I can see the board.

03:49.752 --> 03:52.921
It's... two up, two across,

03:52.922 --> 03:57.276
three down, another left. One up.

04:07.266 --> 04:09.057
Uh...

04:11.299 --> 04:13.095
Ugh!

04:14.597 --> 04:16.774
Boom. Just saved the world, again.

04:16.774 --> 04:19.158
- Did you see us back there?
- We're unstoppable!

04:19.159 --> 04:23.836
What could possibly go wrong?

04:36.785 --> 04:39.538
- Don't do that.
- Do what?

04:39.539 --> 04:42.419
Look, I'm from Oklahoma, okay?

04:42.420 --> 04:45.460
It's not easy for me
to get beat up by...

04:45.461 --> 04:48.662
- By a girl?
- By my boss.

04:48.663 --> 04:51.319
Okay, "Van Damme," try the punching bag.

04:51.320 --> 04:54.300
Give it your best shot.

04:57.724 --> 04:59.740
Good impact, but you
use too much energy.

04:59.741 --> 05:01.524
You'll punch yourself
out fighting like that.

05:01.525 --> 05:03.518
Here, try cocking your
fist at 130-degree angle

05:03.519 --> 05:05.535
from your forearm, bend at the elbow.

05:05.536 --> 05:07.808
- Tae Kwon Do jab.
- Why are you doing this?

05:07.809 --> 05:10.498
What's with all the
practice and the training?

05:10.499 --> 05:14.179
You have a lot of raw talent.

05:14.180 --> 05:17.317
But you've never taken
the time to learn.

05:17.318 --> 05:20.071
Do you know how many years
Flynn trained with Excalibur?

05:20.072 --> 05:22.376
Baird, I'm a brawler,
okay? I'm a brawler.

05:22.377 --> 05:24.600
That's what I do. I've been
a brawler since I was a kid.

05:24.601 --> 05:26.282
I can't learn this stuff.

05:26.283 --> 05:28.075
Yes, you can.

05:28.076 --> 05:30.060
You're a Librarian.

05:30.061 --> 05:32.333
You have multiple PhDs
in history and art.

05:32.334 --> 05:34.927
We're just gonna add
martial arts to that list.

05:34.928 --> 05:38.324
Okay, but the fighting?
That's what we got you for.

05:39.730 --> 05:42.006
I'm more than just your bodyguard.

05:43.348 --> 05:45.495
All right, we'll pick this up tomorrow.

05:49.335 --> 05:51.191
130.

05:51.192 --> 05:54.713
Stupid.

05:59.324 --> 06:01.436
Baird? Baird!

06:01.437 --> 06:04.417
- 'Night, Mr. Stanek.
- Good night, Curtis.

06:30.029 --> 06:31.501
Oh...

06:31.502 --> 06:35.118
Here you go, old man.

06:35.119 --> 06:37.363
Perfect. Good as new.

06:50.455 --> 06:53.080
Stendec, Stendec,

06:53.081 --> 06:56.858
Stendec, Stendec,

06:56.859 --> 07:01.276
Stendec, Stendec, Stendec,

07:01.277 --> 07:04.254
Stendec, Stendec,

07:04.255 --> 07:05.790
- Whoa!
- Stendec...

07:05.791 --> 07:07.391
Stendec...

07:07.392 --> 07:10.625
Stendec, Stendec...

07:10.626 --> 07:11.926
Stendec, Stendec...

07:13.572 --> 07:16.388
Stendec, Stendec...

07:16.389 --> 07:20.903
Stendec, Stendec, Stendec,

07:20.904 --> 07:24.424
Stendec, Stendec...

07:25.962 --> 07:28.106
No. No!

07:28.107 --> 07:29.643
No! No!

07:29.644 --> 07:31.660
Well, my examination is complete.

07:31.661 --> 07:33.901
And now the fabled Nwyfre Runestone

07:33.902 --> 07:35.758
is ready to be housed in its new home.

07:35.759 --> 07:38.255
So what is that? That's
five artifacts in four weeks?

07:38.256 --> 07:39.536
That's pretty impressive, right?

07:39.560 --> 07:40.624
Go ahead, Jenkins, say it.

07:40.625 --> 07:42.130
We're the best team you've ever seen.

07:42.131 --> 07:43.954
Your mothers did not
hug you enough, did they?

07:43.955 --> 07:46.804
I know that face.

07:46.805 --> 07:48.341
That's the "I should be happy,

07:48.342 --> 07:50.294
but instead I'm
unnecessarily worried" face.

07:50.295 --> 07:52.398
Oh, yeah? And what's my "If
you don't leave me alone,

07:52.399 --> 07:55.801
I'm gonna punch you in the face" face?

07:55.802 --> 07:58.618
That one. What's goin' on?

07:58.619 --> 08:00.315
The team's on a roll. We're doin' great.

08:00.316 --> 08:01.756
That's exactly when mistakes happen.

08:01.780 --> 08:03.741
One day you're on top and then, boom!

08:03.742 --> 08:06.462
Fall of Rome, collapse of
the Mayan Empire, Myspace...

08:06.463 --> 08:08.606
Well, you're a "library's
half empty" kinda gal today.

08:08.607 --> 08:11.041
I just want everyone to be better.

08:11.042 --> 08:14.018
Before, when I saw Dulaque
cut the Loom of Fate,

08:14.019 --> 08:15.842
- I saw...
- Alternate versions of themselves.

08:15.843 --> 08:17.796
I know. I was there.
Although I wasn't there,

08:17.797 --> 08:19.173
because I was an alternate
version of myself.

08:19.174 --> 08:21.382
I saw their true potential.
And they're gonna be

08:21.383 --> 08:23.271
amazing Librarians, Flynn, like you.

08:23.272 --> 08:24.808
I just have to get them there faster.

08:24.809 --> 08:26.409
We can't wait 10 years.

08:26.410 --> 08:28.778
- What's the hurry?
- I don't know.

08:28.779 --> 08:30.507
It's just this feeling I have, Flynn.

08:30.508 --> 08:34.125
I can't explain it. Call
it "Guardian's intuition."

08:34.126 --> 08:36.142
Well, I think that you are worrying...

08:36.143 --> 08:40.144
...for no reason... whatsoever.

08:40.145 --> 08:42.292
Ya think?

08:49.468 --> 08:50.715
What the hell just happened?

08:50.716 --> 08:52.636
How did it just explode like that?

08:52.637 --> 08:54.860
It must have been trying to
tell us something important.

08:54.861 --> 08:56.638
Now we'll never know.

08:56.639 --> 08:58.495
Sure we will.

08:58.496 --> 09:00.097
Sure we will. Take a look around you.

09:00.098 --> 09:01.618
There's pieces of the book everywhere.

09:01.619 --> 09:02.979
All we have to do is think of this

09:03.003 --> 09:04.547
as a jigsaw puzzle, right?

09:04.548 --> 09:06.628
Piece what we can back together...

09:06.629 --> 09:09.253
- Find the parts that are missing.
- That's the spirit.

09:09.254 --> 09:11.462
So the clipping book bursts into flames.

09:11.463 --> 09:13.800
Big deal. We can handle that, right?

09:13.801 --> 09:15.400
No problemo.

09:15.401 --> 09:17.386
This is a huge problemo.

09:17.387 --> 09:19.730
The clipping book bursting
into flames? Are you kidding me?

09:19.731 --> 09:21.899
Your grace under pressure
is always admirable, sir.

09:21.900 --> 09:23.643
I told you my "spidey
senses" were tingling,

09:23.644 --> 09:24.622
but you wouldn't listen.

09:24.623 --> 09:26.382
- What...?
- See?

09:26.383 --> 09:28.736
Okay, please. Let's just
concentrate on the matter at hand.

09:28.737 --> 09:29.953
Now we know the clipping book

09:29.954 --> 09:31.729
shows us events that have happened

09:31.730 --> 09:34.002
or are about to happen,
so obviously there are

09:34.003 --> 09:36.179
so many events on the horizon,

09:36.180 --> 09:38.199
that it overloaded.

09:39.446 --> 09:41.239
You know, we could do
this a lot more quickly

09:41.240 --> 09:43.064
if we could just use
a reconstituting spell.

09:43.065 --> 09:45.528
We don't use magic,
Cass. We're Librarians.

09:45.529 --> 09:47.930
- We use our brains.
- Yes, but my brain is telling me

09:47.931 --> 09:49.722
we should use magic. I mean,
we have the greatest collection

09:49.723 --> 09:51.997
of magic in the whole world,
right here in this building.

09:51.998 --> 09:53.278
And we never put it work for us.

09:53.302 --> 09:55.102
- I do.
- You do what?

09:55.103 --> 09:57.663
Use magic. All the time.

09:57.664 --> 09:59.519
Right now I have that knit-wheel thingy

09:59.520 --> 10:01.377
fixing some of my sweaters.

10:04.899 --> 10:07.748
The Spinning Wheel of Clotho?
That's not a toy, Jones.

10:07.749 --> 10:09.733
You guys know why the Library exists?

10:09.734 --> 10:11.558
To save the world from things like that.

10:11.559 --> 10:13.703
Yes, but if we just learned
how to use it properly...

10:13.704 --> 10:15.785
There is always a price to pay.

10:15.786 --> 10:18.473
Now, I do not disagree that
wielding magic can have its benefits,

10:18.474 --> 10:22.156
but I have seen too many
corrupted by its power.

10:22.157 --> 10:23.993
We don't need to use magic.

10:23.994 --> 10:25.453
We have the finest collection
of minds in the world

10:25.454 --> 10:27.054
right here in this very room.

10:27.055 --> 10:29.488
Now, what is the clipping
book trying to tell us?

10:29.489 --> 10:32.351
This is all we could
piece together so far...

10:32.376 --> 10:33.906
Uh-huh, uh-huh, yes.

10:33.907 --> 10:35.699
Obviously, the clipping
book wants us to go

10:35.700 --> 10:39.604
to "Pumpernickel Rubber Bubbles."

10:39.605 --> 10:41.846
Ring a bell?

10:41.847 --> 10:43.319
Anyone?

10:43.320 --> 10:47.065
What about "Potato Duck Girdle"?

10:47.066 --> 10:49.882
Okay, how 'bout "Kidney Weasel..."

10:49.883 --> 10:52.828
Okay, fine, we'll just do
it the old-fashioned way.

10:52.829 --> 10:54.972
It's a gigantic anagram
with missing pieces.

10:54.973 --> 10:59.135
So we need to calculate
the probable outcomes,

10:59.136 --> 11:02.560
divided by the number
of probable events...

11:02.561 --> 11:05.634
in this case, letters, possible words.

11:05.635 --> 11:08.772
And then determining the likely odds,

11:08.773 --> 11:12.261
we can reduce the number
of probable outcomes

11:12.262 --> 11:15.528
until... "Science-Museum-Boston."

11:15.529 --> 11:18.089
- Ah! "Story of Man" exhibit.
- "Story of Man."

11:18.090 --> 11:20.494
- Opened last week.
- Jenkins, we need a door.

11:21.932 --> 11:26.381
Please, I already told
you everything I know.

11:26.382 --> 11:29.007
Tell it to us again. From the beginning.

11:29.008 --> 11:30.415
I was cleaning up.

11:30.416 --> 11:33.169
And then these mannequins came to life.

11:33.170 --> 11:34.482
Mannequins? From the museum?

11:34.483 --> 11:36.115
And attacked me!

11:36.116 --> 11:39.348
Then I passed out and I woke up here.

11:39.349 --> 11:41.301
That's all I know.

11:41.302 --> 11:43.702
Who are you people anyway?

11:43.703 --> 11:45.879
He doesn't know anything.

11:45.880 --> 11:46.904
Cut him loose.

11:49.947 --> 11:51.930
I can't believe it. Do you guys realize

11:51.931 --> 11:54.236
that this museum currently
has the Antikythera mechanism,

11:54.237 --> 11:56.750
only considered to be the first
astronomical clock of its kind?

11:56.751 --> 11:58.191
Keep it together, Cassandra.

11:58.192 --> 12:00.287
Ah, forget the clock.

12:00.288 --> 12:04.449
Would you guys look at
that awesome submarine?

12:04.450 --> 12:08.195
Dude, that's a 1950s
Barbel-class diesel electric,

12:08.196 --> 12:11.237
- single propeller shaft.
- AKA, the coolest thing ever.

12:11.238 --> 12:13.446
Gotta go, man. I've wanted
to do it since I was a kid.

12:13.447 --> 12:15.783
Guys, we're here to work. Remember?

12:15.784 --> 12:17.961
How 'bout you three guys
go check out what's inside

12:17.962 --> 12:21.130
and Stone and I will
investigate the sub?

12:21.131 --> 12:23.662
We'll go out here... there's
probably so many clues...

12:25.517 --> 12:28.237
Thank you. Exhibit
is closed, move along.

12:28.238 --> 12:30.927
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

12:30.928 --> 12:33.937
Open again in an hour. Thank
you, move along. Scootch along.

12:33.938 --> 12:36.850
- Sorry, we're closed.
- What... what happened?

12:36.851 --> 12:38.914
The janitor freaked out,
started trashing the place.

12:38.915 --> 12:40.757
Probably hammered, if you ask me.

12:40.758 --> 12:44.599
Started rantin' about
spirits... ? Something like that.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.391
Do you happen to know where he is now?

12:46.392 --> 12:48.088
What are you, cops?

12:48.089 --> 12:51.995
No. We're Librarians.

12:51.996 --> 12:54.139
Boston General. Somebody
dumped him on the front steps

12:54.140 --> 12:55.196
and split.

12:55.197 --> 12:57.728
Thank you very much.

12:58.911 --> 13:00.575
Looks like we're in the right place.

13:00.576 --> 13:02.639
Okay, Flynn and I are gonna
go talk to this janitor,

13:02.640 --> 13:05.378
you guys stay here, see what you
can find out about these "spirits."

13:05.379 --> 13:06.579
I know just the place to look.

13:06.603 --> 13:08.451
And no submarines.

13:08.452 --> 13:09.636
- But it's on...
- No subs.

13:09.637 --> 13:11.268
- It's right...
- No subs.

13:11.269 --> 13:13.292
- You go out the door.
- No subs, no subs, no subs.

13:17.001 --> 13:19.144
Hello. Jell-O?

13:19.145 --> 13:21.706
- Get away from me. Nurse?
- No Jell-O?

13:21.707 --> 13:23.115
You do not want the Jell-O?

13:23.116 --> 13:26.573
I've already told you
people everything I know.

13:26.574 --> 13:28.496
Nurse?

13:30.864 --> 13:32.495
- You see the mark on his neck?
- Yeah.

13:32.496 --> 13:34.672
A distinct nozzle pattern
with a slight impression.

13:34.673 --> 13:36.696
I would say, judging from
the film around his mouth

13:36.697 --> 13:38.354
and the cloudiness in the eyes,

13:38.355 --> 13:40.659
that he's probably been injected
with a powerful sedative,

13:40.660 --> 13:43.029
midazolam most likely,
in the past 12 hours.

13:43.030 --> 13:45.046
He's been interrogated
by the government.

13:45.047 --> 13:47.928
Injection guns with midazolam
is textbook black ops.

13:47.929 --> 13:49.465
Like a secret group tracking magic.

13:49.466 --> 13:51.674
Do you know how ridiculous that sounds?

13:51.675 --> 13:52.826
Other than us, I mean?

13:52.827 --> 13:54.459
I knew this was gonna happen.

13:54.460 --> 13:55.932
With magic out there, it
was only a matter of time

13:55.933 --> 13:58.214
before the government put
together their own task force...

13:58.238 --> 13:59.230
this is bad, Flynn.

13:59.231 --> 14:00.619
This is wonderful.

14:00.620 --> 14:02.220
Are you sure you don't want any of this?

14:02.244 --> 14:03.482
Enough with the Jell-O!

14:04.417 --> 14:06.050
- What are we gonna do about him?
- Who?

14:06.051 --> 14:09.379
- The Johnson.
- Oh. Right. Um...

14:09.380 --> 14:12.773
Okay, Mr. Johnson. We are
in fact from the government.

14:12.774 --> 14:15.574
And if you don't tell us exactly
what happened at the museum yesterday,

14:15.575 --> 14:17.495
we will be forced to give
you another injection.

14:17.496 --> 14:20.520
Except this time, with a
concentrated lethal dose.

14:20.521 --> 14:23.339
- You're holding a pen.
- No, I'm not.

14:23.340 --> 14:25.548
I can see it in your
hands. It says "Bic."

14:25.549 --> 14:28.077
- Okay, that didn't work.
- How's 20 bucks sound?

14:28.078 --> 14:29.968
50. Hmm?

14:36.018 --> 14:37.714
That guy wasn't kiddin'.

14:37.715 --> 14:39.859
The janitor trashed the joint.

14:39.860 --> 14:41.940
Why would he do this?

14:41.941 --> 14:44.341
Well, no one likes to drink alone.

14:44.342 --> 14:45.654
Grabbed the only mates he had

14:45.655 --> 14:48.760
and bingo, instant costume party.

14:48.761 --> 14:51.129
I don't think so.

14:51.130 --> 14:54.011
All these mannequins, they're
not where they're supposed to be.

14:54.012 --> 14:55.515
It's almost as if...

14:55.516 --> 14:57.952
As if they moved on their own.

14:59.646 --> 15:02.815
They cornered me and then I passed out.

15:02.816 --> 15:04.768
That's all I remember.

15:04.769 --> 15:07.585
Did these mannequins try to
make contact with you in any way?

15:07.586 --> 15:10.211
Did they give you something,
did they say something?

15:10.212 --> 15:13.221
They said a word, over and over again.

15:13.222 --> 15:15.269
Stan... something.

15:15.270 --> 15:17.223
I don't know. I was
scared outta my mind.

15:17.224 --> 15:19.720
Please, Mr. Johnson. Try and remember.

15:19.721 --> 15:21.128
What word was it?

15:21.129 --> 15:23.626
Stan... die.

15:23.627 --> 15:26.028
Stan... Stan-dike.

15:26.029 --> 15:27.724
"Stan-deck."

15:27.725 --> 15:30.381
That's it. Stendec.

15:30.382 --> 15:34.704
Stendec, Stendec, Stendec...

15:34.705 --> 15:39.154
Stendec, Stendec, Stendec...

15:39.155 --> 15:42.228
Stendec, Stendec,

15:42.229 --> 15:45.141
Stendec, Stendec...

15:45.142 --> 15:49.179
Stendec, Stendec, Stendec...

15:49.930 --> 15:53.036
The thing is, we've seen possessed
people before. This was different.

15:53.037 --> 15:55.565
They kept saying this
word over and over again.

15:55.566 --> 15:56.717
"Stendec."

15:56.718 --> 16:00.111
Comatose patients and museum mannequins.

16:00.112 --> 16:03.185
Interesting because when
animate subjects are possessed,

16:03.186 --> 16:05.586
the culprits can be any
number of vengeful spirits.

16:05.587 --> 16:07.315
Like the South American Llorona,

16:07.316 --> 16:09.268
or the Chinese Mogwai,
et cetera, et cetera.

16:09.269 --> 16:12.117
But when inanimates are possessed...

16:12.118 --> 16:15.095
Mr. Carsen? Listening?

16:15.096 --> 16:18.040
Spirits, possessions,
inanimate objects, check.

16:18.041 --> 16:20.570
- What are you doing?
- Oh, I just love this.

16:20.571 --> 16:22.907
Reminds me of telling ghost
stories around a campfire.

16:22.908 --> 16:25.084
But incomplete without...

16:25.085 --> 16:27.361
s'mores.

16:28.607 --> 16:31.008
Charming.

16:31.009 --> 16:32.192
Oh, my...

16:32.193 --> 16:34.113
Inanimates are almost always possessed

16:34.114 --> 16:36.674
by animistic deities.

16:36.675 --> 16:38.035
They've been around for centuries.

16:38.059 --> 16:40.453
The most famous of
course being gargoyles...

16:40.454 --> 16:42.630
Oh... Mm, sorry, Forgot.

16:42.631 --> 16:45.543
- Stumpy...
- Yeah, well, there you go.

16:45.544 --> 16:47.784
What the janitor saw, mannequins,

16:47.785 --> 16:49.160
they did not try to cause harm.

16:49.161 --> 16:50.281
They merely chanted.

16:50.282 --> 16:51.562
My belief, they were possessed

16:51.563 --> 16:54.027
by animistic deities
or "household spirits."

16:54.028 --> 16:56.269
And they reside with the sole purpose

16:56.270 --> 16:58.286
of protecting valuables in the home.

16:58.287 --> 16:59.726
And when a threat is perceived...

16:59.727 --> 17:01.680
Spirits warn against impending danger.

17:01.681 --> 17:03.761
Like a magical security system.

17:03.762 --> 17:06.224
Yeah, but that doesn't explain
the sing-along at the hospital.

17:06.226 --> 17:08.595
Sure it does, because Animistic deities

17:08.596 --> 17:10.324
travel through unconscious states.

17:10.325 --> 17:11.845
And since the patients at the hospital

17:11.868 --> 17:13.366
were all comatose,

17:13.367 --> 17:14.614
they were the perfect vessels.

17:14.615 --> 17:17.240
Okay, so they were trying to warn us.

17:17.241 --> 17:19.128
- About what?
- Well, my bet would be

17:19.130 --> 17:21.042
your answer lies in the
word they were chanting.

17:21.044 --> 17:22.483
What did you... Stendec?

17:22.508 --> 17:23.386
- Stendec.
- Stendec.

17:23.387 --> 17:27.069
What if... what if they
were saying "stekhdak"?

17:27.069 --> 17:29.886
It's an Ancient Egyptian
word. It's pre-2600 BC.

17:29.887 --> 17:31.391
Hasn't been spoken a long time,

17:31.392 --> 17:33.335
so no one really knows
the correct pronunciation.

17:33.336 --> 17:35.553
But it means... "Hours of the day."

17:35.554 --> 17:37.731
So, a calendar?

17:37.732 --> 17:39.683
Clock?

17:39.684 --> 17:41.604
There's a clock at the museum!

17:41.605 --> 17:44.294
The Antikythera mechanism!

17:44.295 --> 17:46.023
I know, keep it together.

17:46.024 --> 17:47.848
Guess we're goin' back to Boston.

17:47.849 --> 17:49.865
Great! And maybe while we're there

17:49.866 --> 17:52.333
- we could check out the awesome...
- No sub.

18:13.206 --> 18:17.079
Hey, pally? What the hell
you think you're doin'?

18:17.080 --> 18:19.416
You plan on cleanin' up this mess?

18:19.417 --> 18:22.714
- Problem, Sull?
- No. I got this. Just another drunk.

18:22.715 --> 18:25.726
Listen, pal, you're gonna have to leave.

18:28.350 --> 18:29.982
What are you still doin' here?

18:29.983 --> 18:31.646
I told you, I don't
need your stupid help!

18:31.647 --> 18:34.720
Who you callin' stupid, fatso? Ugh!

18:56.460 --> 18:59.021
Guys, the Antikythera
mechanism is a big deal.

18:59.022 --> 19:00.695
Do you have any idea
how big a deal it is?

19:00.696 --> 19:02.319
I have a feeling
you're about to tell us.

19:02.320 --> 19:03.760
Because it is a big deal!

19:03.761 --> 19:05.841
It was discovered in 1901
by a couple of sponge divers

19:05.842 --> 19:07.915
- off the Greek island of Antikythera.
- Yeah, okay,

19:07.916 --> 19:09.548
- but I wanted to tell the...
- The mechanism, when functioning,

19:09.549 --> 19:11.475
was able to track the
moon, track the sun,

19:11.476 --> 19:14.486
predict eclipses.
Nobody knows who made it,

19:14.487 --> 19:17.559
but radiocarbon dating
puts it back about 150 BC.

19:17.560 --> 19:19.160
Okay, but the truly interesting thing...

19:19.161 --> 19:20.641
That date predates similar technology

19:20.665 --> 19:21.945
by at least a thousand years.

19:21.946 --> 19:24.289
Okay, well, now you're both
uninvited to my birthday party.

19:24.290 --> 19:25.243
Ooh, look at that.

19:25.244 --> 19:28.224
Whoever designed this
was ahead of their time.

19:32.447 --> 19:34.470
You said that this was no
longer functional, right?

19:34.471 --> 19:36.513
Yes. That is correct.
Despite numerous attempts,

19:36.514 --> 19:38.474
scientists have never been
able to get it to work.

19:38.498 --> 19:40.035
Er, then why is it ticking?

19:43.942 --> 19:46.406
That's not possible.

19:46.407 --> 19:48.999
The mechanism hasn't worked
in thousands of years.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.760
This place is full of surprises.

19:50.761 --> 19:52.650
Wait a minute, the
constellation dial is off.

19:52.651 --> 19:54.731
The North Star, it
isn't in the right place.

19:54.732 --> 19:56.492
Give it a break, it's
more than 2,000 years old.

19:56.493 --> 19:58.060
No, but the North Star is
always in a fixed position.

19:58.061 --> 20:00.084
It's like in a compass,
how it always points north.

20:00.085 --> 20:03.471
- Exactly how far off is it?
- Uh, 2.3 degrees south,

20:03.472 --> 20:05.648
6.5 degrees east.

20:05.649 --> 20:07.441
That's a latitude and longitude.

20:07.442 --> 20:09.939
The clock is giving us a location.

20:11.765 --> 20:13.908
It's here in the museum.

20:13.909 --> 20:16.694
Should be right about...

20:18.905 --> 20:20.731
...here.

20:27.229 --> 20:29.789
And before the fight broke
out, what instigated it?

20:29.790 --> 20:32.062
I'm sorry, who are you people again?

20:32.063 --> 20:34.943
Agent Prichard, I'm with "DOSA"...

20:34.944 --> 20:37.121
Department of Statistical Anomalies.

20:37.122 --> 20:39.330
Statistical what?

20:39.331 --> 20:41.763
You were saying?

20:41.764 --> 20:44.709
Oh, uh, yeah. Some drunk came in.

20:44.710 --> 20:47.398
Starts tossin' our brochures
around, lookin' for somethin'.

20:47.399 --> 20:49.287
Anything in particular?

20:49.288 --> 20:51.307
Yeah.

20:54.635 --> 20:56.654
This one.

21:04.048 --> 21:06.191
We should be pretty close
to those coordinates.

21:06.192 --> 21:07.921
Everybody keep your eyes peeled.

21:07.922 --> 21:10.806
For what, asbestos? 'Cause
that's all I can see.

21:16.598 --> 21:18.166
Ooh...!

21:18.167 --> 21:20.151
Easy.

21:20.152 --> 21:22.332
It's original brickwork.

21:23.482 --> 21:25.210
This museum's built on the bones

21:25.211 --> 21:27.644
of an 18th-century church.
This is original subfloor.

21:27.645 --> 21:30.077
- A smuggling vault.
- The church smuggled?

21:30.078 --> 21:32.061
- Ooh.
- Everybody did.

21:32.062 --> 21:34.645
Most buildings in 18th-century
Massachusetts had smuggling vaults

21:34.646 --> 21:36.416
or tunnels hidden under the basements.

21:36.417 --> 21:38.722
They hid money. Or loot
from the government.

21:38.723 --> 21:40.193
Kind of an early act of defiance

21:40.194 --> 21:41.859
against Thomas
Jefferson's first tax laws.

21:41.860 --> 21:44.323
- In fact, funny story about those...
- All right, stand back.

21:54.891 --> 21:56.234
Hello.

21:57.708 --> 21:59.501
Come on, man.

21:59.502 --> 22:01.645
Well, well, well.

22:01.646 --> 22:04.495
I think I know who the spirits
were trying to warn us about.

22:04.496 --> 22:06.386
Apep, god of Chaos.

22:13.001 --> 22:15.715
Apep... Egyptian god of Chaos,

22:15.716 --> 22:18.886
and sworn enemy to Ra, the sun god.

22:18.887 --> 22:20.614
Nasty piece of work.

22:20.615 --> 22:23.624
Egyptians referred to him
as "The Eater of Souls."

22:23.625 --> 22:26.825
I thought that Ra imprisoned
this cat like centuries ago,

22:26.826 --> 22:30.123
- left him for dead.
- Apparently not.

22:30.124 --> 22:31.628
While repairing the clipping book,

22:31.629 --> 22:33.549
I discovered another article.

22:33.550 --> 22:35.311
A tourist, Barry Dubecki, ex-Navy,

22:35.312 --> 22:37.936
went missing while
visiting the Great Pyramids.

22:37.937 --> 22:40.657
Coincidentally, archeologists nearby

22:40.658 --> 22:42.610
had just unearthed a sarcophagus

22:42.611 --> 22:44.979
believed to be several
thousand years old.

22:44.980 --> 22:47.701
Apep's sarcophagus? Okay.

22:47.702 --> 22:49.022
Well, if this guy, Barry found it

22:49.023 --> 22:50.535
and somehow released Apep's spirit...

22:50.536 --> 22:51.863
It would possess his body.

22:51.864 --> 22:55.545
Allowing the god of Chaos
to manifest in human form.

22:55.546 --> 22:57.370
And now he wants the key.

22:57.371 --> 22:59.419
- Key? What key?
- Colonel, the gold box.

22:59.420 --> 23:02.301
It holds the key that
can unlock Pure Evil.

23:02.302 --> 23:04.893
"Pure Evil"? As opposed
to what, fake evil?

23:04.894 --> 23:09.024
Pure Evil is a force.
Along with Pure Good.

23:09.025 --> 23:10.888
And there's a delicate
balance between the two.

23:10.889 --> 23:13.858
The Library was created
to protect that balance

23:13.859 --> 23:16.292
and the only reason Pure Evil

23:16.293 --> 23:18.085
is not running rampant right now

23:18.086 --> 23:20.934
is the first Librarian
was able to seal it

23:20.935 --> 23:23.368
in a portal, never to be opened.

23:23.369 --> 23:25.705
So Apep wants to upset the balance.

23:25.706 --> 23:28.170
If he manages to open the
portal and release Pure Evil...

23:28.171 --> 23:30.123
It'll feed off the open ley lines,

23:30.124 --> 23:31.596
growing stronger by the minute.

23:31.597 --> 23:33.157
Plunging our whole world into darkness.

23:33.181 --> 23:34.766
And here I was worried about asbestos.

23:34.767 --> 23:37.263
I highly suggest that
you retrieve the key

23:37.264 --> 23:39.728
before Apep does.

23:39.729 --> 23:42.450
It's locked. Combination lock.

23:42.451 --> 23:44.242
Combination lock?

23:44.243 --> 23:46.355
Oh, you do know I'm a thief, right?

23:46.356 --> 23:48.981
It might as well just say,
"Property of Ezekiel Jones."

23:48.982 --> 23:52.727
Most combination locks have a series
of discs inside, each one with a notch.

23:52.728 --> 23:54.712
When you dial the right
combo, the notches align,

23:54.713 --> 23:57.081
and click, you're in.

23:57.082 --> 23:59.867
This tricky guy, he
has multiple notches.

23:59.868 --> 24:02.717
Unless there's someway I can
see the configuration inside,

24:02.718 --> 24:04.781
- this could take hours.
- How are we gonna do that?

24:04.782 --> 24:06.463
We don't have an x-ray machine.

24:06.464 --> 24:09.024
Mm...

24:09.025 --> 24:11.072
I am gonna regret saying this,

24:11.073 --> 24:13.154
but we do have a sonar system.

24:13.155 --> 24:15.843
- The sub? Submarine!
- The sub? The sub.

24:15.844 --> 24:17.668
Since sonic waves bounce off metal,

24:17.669 --> 24:18.949
we could modify the equipment

24:18.950 --> 24:21.029
and turn it into an
ultrasound and in theory,

24:21.030 --> 24:23.311
that would let us see into
the box. Please, don't hate me.

24:23.335 --> 24:24.840
Okay, get the sonar equipment

24:24.841 --> 24:26.904
and come right back. This
is no time to mess around.

24:26.905 --> 24:28.457
Please! We're professionals.

24:28.458 --> 24:30.411
I've got dibs on the periscope!

24:30.412 --> 24:31.631
Not if I get there first!

24:34.094 --> 24:36.750
They're taking too long. I knew
I shouldn't have let them go.

24:36.751 --> 24:38.791
They're probably halfway
across the Atlantic by now.

24:38.792 --> 24:40.520
Something about these symbols.

24:40.521 --> 24:42.289
Can't quite put my finger on it.

24:42.290 --> 24:45.010
You know, if we really wanted
to open it, I could use a spell.

24:45.011 --> 24:48.052
I am so sick of you going
on and on about magic.

24:48.053 --> 24:49.877
- Why don't you just drop it?
- Oh, what?

24:49.878 --> 24:51.861
Are you afraid someone
younger and better than you

24:51.862 --> 24:53.463
is gonna steal your glory?

24:53.464 --> 24:56.441
- You are an amateur, Cillian!
- And you are a dinosaur!

25:03.005 --> 25:06.046
- Whew.
- I'm sorry. That was weird.

25:06.047 --> 25:08.407
- What just happened?
- That was... weird.

25:08.408 --> 25:09.318
I'm not sure what just...

25:09.343 --> 25:10.624
Listen, we're all under a lot of stress.

25:10.625 --> 25:12.568
- ...just came over me.
- Trying to open the box.

25:12.569 --> 25:14.242
Flynn, you almost just poked my eye out.

25:14.243 --> 25:17.251
Eye! That's it! Yes!

25:17.252 --> 25:19.155
You don't want to talk
about what just happened?

25:19.156 --> 25:20.165
No, no, no. Listen.

25:20.166 --> 25:22.918
The Eye of Horus is the
Egyptian emblem of protection.

25:22.919 --> 25:25.512
Traditionally symbolized by a
falcon eye with a single teardrop.

25:25.513 --> 25:29.290
Each of these symbols represents
a different part of the eye.

25:29.291 --> 25:30.994
But the Eye of Horus
wasn't only an emblem.

25:30.995 --> 25:32.715
It's also a math pictogram.

25:32.716 --> 25:34.796
The Egyptians, they used
it to make calculations.

25:34.797 --> 25:36.909
Each symbol represented a fraction...

25:36.910 --> 25:39.695
the pupil is one quarter.
The eyebrow, 1/8th,

25:39.696 --> 25:41.409
- and the teardrop, 1/64th.
- Right.

25:41.410 --> 25:43.474
And if you theoretically
add up all these numbers...

25:43.475 --> 25:45.138
It's the combination of the lock.

25:45.139 --> 25:46.659
It was here on the box the whole time.

25:46.683 --> 25:49.172
12-67. Try 12-6-7.

25:49.173 --> 25:51.029
Unbelievable. You and your...

25:51.030 --> 25:54.807
"12-67." 12-6-7.

26:05.630 --> 26:09.026
We're too late. Apep was already here.

26:11.105 --> 26:14.273
- Slow. Yeah, slow.
- This place is awesome.

26:14.274 --> 26:15.434
Go, set it down. Set it down.

26:15.458 --> 26:16.931
Don't drop it.

26:20.774 --> 26:22.598
- What did you touch?
- Nothing...

26:22.599 --> 26:24.682
- What did you touch?
- Nothing!

26:42.897 --> 26:45.714
Stone? Forget about the sonar,
Apep already has the key.

26:45.715 --> 26:46.555
Meet us at the lobby.

26:46.556 --> 26:48.064
Well, that's gonna be a
little hard right now, okay?

26:48.065 --> 26:50.228
'Cause we're currently
on a moving submarine!

26:50.229 --> 26:52.533
- This is no time for a joy ride.
- Not our idea.

26:52.534 --> 26:54.070
This sub's been pre-programmed.

26:54.071 --> 26:55.635
It's Apep. He's taken the sub.

26:55.636 --> 26:57.176
Now that he has the key,
he's going for the portal.

26:57.177 --> 26:58.800
Wait a minute. A
thousand-year-old spirit

26:58.801 --> 27:00.538
can program a modern-age submarine?

27:00.539 --> 27:02.715
He can if the body he
possesses is ex-Navy.

27:02.716 --> 27:05.136
Stone, check all the cabins.
See if you can find Apep.

27:15.715 --> 27:19.527
Torpedo armed and loaded
in tube number two.

27:30.762 --> 27:32.654
Whoa! What the...?

27:40.207 --> 27:41.519
Ezekiel, talk to me.

27:41.520 --> 27:43.537
The sub just did an
about-face on its own.

27:43.538 --> 27:46.258
- It's heading back to port.
- Why would it do that?

27:46.259 --> 27:49.332
- Stone? Have you found Apep?
- Not exactly.

27:49.333 --> 27:51.765
He's programmed the torpedo to
launch in less than a minute.

27:51.766 --> 27:55.065
He's gonna try to blow up the museum.

27:56.837 --> 27:58.226
We have to evacuate the museum.

27:58.227 --> 28:00.347
We don't have time. Not with
the size of that warhead.

28:00.371 --> 28:02.260
Here, let me. Can you
access the launch program?

28:02.261 --> 28:05.397
I'm trying, but the onboards
haven't been upgraded since the '80s.

28:05.398 --> 28:07.958
I'm a millennial. I don't
know any of this "Atari" crap.

28:07.959 --> 28:09.759
Try a matrix system,
I'll walk you through it.

28:09.760 --> 28:10.874
What about the breech door?

28:10.875 --> 28:12.890
- 30 seconds to launch.
- It won't budge.

28:12.891 --> 28:15.963
- There's water filling the tube.
- Okay, to disengage the torpedo,

28:15.964 --> 28:18.147
you're gonna have to manually
drain the flood chambers.

28:18.148 --> 28:19.381
- Are you kidding?
- No, I'm not kidding.

28:19.382 --> 28:22.182
- If he hasn't equalized the pressure...
- I have a degree... a Ph.D...

28:22.206 --> 28:23.810
It's not helping! Not helping!

28:25.665 --> 28:28.129
So you're gonna wanna go

28:28.130 --> 28:30.978
into the main terminal and then
use a linear and by an algorithm...

28:30.979 --> 28:33.658
- 3/0/6.
- It's not working.

28:35.203 --> 28:37.350
- We're runnin' out of time.
- He's not gonna make it.

28:37.351 --> 28:39.184
- The hell he isn't.
- Slash two...

28:39.185 --> 28:41.008
Ezekiel, do you have
any control over the sub?

28:41.009 --> 28:42.409
Only auxiliary power, propulsion.

28:42.410 --> 28:44.833
Okay, listen carefully. I need
you to throttle the propellers

28:44.834 --> 28:46.507
to maximum speed and
come straight at us.

28:46.508 --> 28:48.780
Uh, I'm sorry. You wanna
get blown up sooner?

28:48.781 --> 28:51.469
It takes at least 400 yards
for a torpedo to arm itself.

28:51.470 --> 28:53.813
The closer you get to the
museum, harder it is to detonate.

28:53.814 --> 28:56.879
That makes sense... almost.

28:56.880 --> 29:00.081
Six, five, four,

29:00.082 --> 29:02.194
three, two...

29:05.110 --> 29:07.993
- Torpedoes away!
- Hold on.

29:13.658 --> 29:16.122
- It worked. No explosion.
- Ha! We did it!

29:16.123 --> 29:18.939
You don't understand. We're not
out of this yet. Ezekiel, full stop!

29:25.184 --> 29:26.402
It's not stopping.

29:33.508 --> 29:35.300
Ugh-hh!

29:43.081 --> 29:45.132
Whew.

29:47.179 --> 29:49.327
Now, how do I get out of here?

29:53.743 --> 29:54.436
There they are.

29:54.437 --> 29:56.135
I am never swimming there again.

29:56.136 --> 29:57.936
I'm officially over submarines.

29:57.937 --> 30:00.337
I don't get it. So
Apep stole a submarine

30:00.338 --> 30:01.810
just to try to kill us?

30:01.811 --> 30:04.599
Maybe he was trying to
build a swimming pool.

30:06.549 --> 30:08.469
Torpedo was never meant for us.

30:08.470 --> 30:10.102
Apep just needed access to the portal

30:10.103 --> 30:12.571
which was under the museum.

30:28.705 --> 30:30.693
Apep!

30:31.907 --> 30:33.500
_

30:33.636 --> 30:37.368
_

30:42.600 --> 30:44.616
You speak our tongue,

30:44.617 --> 30:46.633
but you are not one of us.

30:46.634 --> 30:48.747
You are weak.

30:48.748 --> 30:51.116
Do you really think
you can defeat a god?

30:51.117 --> 30:53.165
A god in an out-of-shape
50-year-old's body?

30:53.166 --> 30:55.278
Yeah, I like our chances.

30:55.279 --> 30:59.152
I have laid waste to legions.

30:59.153 --> 31:01.778
Turned oceans into blood.

31:01.779 --> 31:04.051
And after Pure Evil is released,

31:04.052 --> 31:07.541
I will reign forever.

31:07.542 --> 31:09.846
You cannot stop me.

31:09.847 --> 31:12.859
Just watch us. Go.

31:19.228 --> 31:21.980
Why are you all just standing there?

31:21.981 --> 31:24.990
- I gave you an order!
- You know, I'm getting sick and tired

31:24.991 --> 31:26.603
of you giving us orders.
If I'm honest about it,

31:26.604 --> 31:29.120
- I should be the one calling the shots.
- Don't you touch me!

31:29.121 --> 31:31.521
You know what? None of you are
smart enough to be the leader.

31:31.522 --> 31:34.403
- I'm the only one who understands magic.
- That's why nobody trusts you!

31:59.921 --> 32:02.161
- What just happened?
- Was I just yelling?

32:02.162 --> 32:04.371
It's Apep, he's used some kind of spell

32:04.372 --> 32:06.163
to turn us against each
other. That must have been

32:06.164 --> 32:08.147
- what happened back in the basement.
- Of course.

32:08.148 --> 32:09.388
He's the god of Chaos.
He's using all of our

32:09.389 --> 32:11.630
personal differences to try
to divide us, split us apart.

32:11.654 --> 32:14.168
So what do we do? Think good
thoughts, like "Peter Pan"?

32:14.169 --> 32:17.049
Like, give him nothin' to work
with. Show him we're a team.

32:17.050 --> 32:19.898
She's right. The only
way to defeat chaos?

32:19.899 --> 32:21.916
- Harmony.
- Oh, no.

32:21.917 --> 32:23.837
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

33:07.829 --> 33:10.037
You made a mistake, Apep.

33:10.038 --> 33:13.334
You thought you could
divide us. Cause chaos.

33:13.335 --> 33:15.672
But you don't know who I am.

33:15.673 --> 33:17.305
Who we are.

33:17.306 --> 33:19.706
We are united. Bonded together.

33:19.707 --> 33:21.691
In a common cause.

33:21.692 --> 33:24.349
- A common purpose.
- A family.

33:24.350 --> 33:26.750
I'd do anything for
them. Even die for them.

33:26.751 --> 33:28.702
You can't divide us.
Your magic is useless.

33:28.703 --> 33:30.688
Who are you?

33:30.689 --> 33:32.417
Think hard.

33:32.418 --> 33:35.330
Who banished the evil
you wish to release?

33:35.331 --> 33:37.411
Who protects this world?

33:37.412 --> 33:39.239
Who do you fear the most?

33:40.614 --> 33:42.758
Librarian?

33:42.759 --> 33:44.968
- You...?
- That's me.

33:44.969 --> 33:47.177
- And me.
- And me.

33:47.178 --> 33:50.093
And me.

33:50.924 --> 33:52.971
Bam!

33:52.972 --> 33:54.540
Look, the portal's opening.

33:54.541 --> 33:56.816
Stone, get the key.

34:09.621 --> 34:11.221
- There you go.
- Ooh...!

34:11.222 --> 34:12.886
Nobody move!

34:12.887 --> 34:14.938
Hands in the air.

34:26.728 --> 34:28.422
You're under arrest on the authority

34:28.424 --> 34:31.304
of the Department of
Statistical Anomalies.

34:31.306 --> 34:33.929
What? You can't arrest
us. On what charge?

34:33.931 --> 34:37.708
We've been tracking unexplained
phenomena for the past several months.

34:37.710 --> 34:40.561
And they all had one thing in common.

34:41.552 --> 34:43.503
You.

34:43.504 --> 34:45.424
The artifact. Hand it over.

34:45.425 --> 34:47.608
- You're making a mistake.
- You're messing with powers

34:47.609 --> 34:51.004
- that you can't possibly understand.
- Now!

34:54.934 --> 34:56.949
- I told you these guys were
gonna be a problem. - It's okay.

34:56.951 --> 34:59.031
- It doesn't matter without the orb.
- What was that?

34:59.032 --> 35:01.016
- Nothing.
- You said something about an orb.

35:01.017 --> 35:02.393
No, I don't think that I...

35:02.394 --> 35:05.467
let me finish. The Orb of Nephthys.

35:05.468 --> 35:06.908
The Ankh's magical powers don't work

35:06.932 --> 35:09.373
unless they're linked to the Orb.

35:09.374 --> 35:12.031
I'm actually a little surprised
that you guys didn't know that.

35:12.032 --> 35:13.983
Well, of course we knew about that.

35:13.984 --> 35:16.161
I just didn't know that you knew.

35:16.162 --> 35:18.178
- Where is the Orb?
- He's got it.

35:18.179 --> 35:20.102
On his pants.

35:21.189 --> 35:23.239
Watch them.

35:27.431 --> 35:29.480
Hey!

35:29.481 --> 35:31.401
Wake up.

35:31.402 --> 35:33.354
By the authority of DOSA, I command you

35:33.355 --> 35:36.014
to hand over that orb.

35:41.679 --> 35:44.015
Get over here and help me.

35:44.016 --> 35:46.323
Don't you dare disobey me.

35:52.917 --> 35:54.549
Sneaky Librarian.

36:15.073 --> 36:18.469
Wh... where did they...
where did they go?

36:31.017 --> 36:32.745
But why not start a band?

36:32.746 --> 36:34.186
I mean, we have the talent, clearly.

36:34.210 --> 36:35.530
And we have the instruments...

36:35.531 --> 36:37.099
Pan's flute, Gabriel's horn,

36:37.100 --> 36:38.700
Mozart's piano.

36:38.701 --> 36:40.717
Guys, what do you think
we should call the band?

36:40.718 --> 36:44.111
Uh, "The Dewey Decimals"?
No, that's too obvious.

36:44.112 --> 36:45.583
"The Bibliotechnos"!

36:45.584 --> 36:47.569
The Ankh is safe back in the Library,

36:47.570 --> 36:49.906
the portal to Pure
Evil is closed forever.

36:49.907 --> 36:51.987
- Not a bad day's work.
- Well done.

36:51.988 --> 36:53.332
Oh, and that government group?

36:53.333 --> 36:54.893
The Department of whatever, whatever...

36:54.917 --> 36:57.045
Statistical Anomalies? DOSA.

36:57.046 --> 36:58.999
Oh, they'll be back. I'm sure.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.984
You know, they can make
things very complicated.

37:00.985 --> 37:02.848
Well, how much do you
think they know about us?

37:02.849 --> 37:04.345
About the library and magic?

37:04.346 --> 37:06.298
It's what they don't
know that worries me.

37:06.299 --> 37:07.739
I mean, them running around,

37:07.740 --> 37:09.308
gathering up artifacts
they don't understand.

37:09.309 --> 37:10.869
The consequences could be catastrophic.

37:10.870 --> 37:12.493
Well, we'll have to
keep our eye on them.

37:12.494 --> 37:14.207
What about Apep? He's still out there.

37:14.208 --> 37:15.408
I think that without the Ankh,

37:15.432 --> 37:17.216
and without a host body to inhabit,

37:17.217 --> 37:19.874
we don't have much to worry about there.

37:19.875 --> 37:21.765
Excuse me.

37:23.429 --> 37:25.797
All right, let's get this over with.

37:25.798 --> 37:27.878
I don't know what you're talking about.

37:27.879 --> 37:30.375
Oh, yes you do. Earlier
I told you I was worried,

37:30.376 --> 37:32.136
I didn't feel our team
was ready and you...

37:32.137 --> 37:34.473
Were 100% right? Did that happen?

37:34.474 --> 37:38.251
- I don't...
- I need to have more faith in the team.

37:38.252 --> 37:41.228
We really are ready for anything.

37:41.229 --> 37:43.505
Well, Ankh you very much.

37:45.777 --> 37:48.433
For the last time, I don't know nothin'.

37:48.434 --> 37:49.810
Now let me outta here.

37:49.811 --> 37:52.915
You're a Navy man, aren't you?

37:52.916 --> 37:56.821
So I'm sure you know all
about the Battle of Salamis.

37:56.822 --> 37:59.990
A couple hundred ago, a
Greek guy with 300 ships

37:59.991 --> 38:02.392
managed to defeat a Persian fleet

38:02.393 --> 38:04.922
four times its size.

38:04.923 --> 38:06.106
You know how he did it?

38:06.107 --> 38:08.731
He sent a slave to the Persian commander

38:08.732 --> 38:10.556
saying the Greeks were gonna retreat,

38:10.557 --> 38:13.790
which in turn, lured the
Persians into a tactical trap

38:13.791 --> 38:16.319
from which they could not escape.

38:16.320 --> 38:18.465
In short, he lied.

38:18.466 --> 38:21.314
Just like you're lying to me right now.

38:21.315 --> 38:24.743
Only you're not gonna get away with it.

38:28.102 --> 38:31.946
Now, why don't we start
from the beginning?

38:35.851 --> 38:37.643
Mr. Carsen.

38:37.644 --> 38:40.012
I thought I smelled the
burning of midnight oil.

38:40.013 --> 38:41.933
Thank you, Jenkins.

38:41.934 --> 38:44.846
Just thought I'd get
a little reading in.

38:44.847 --> 38:47.536
"Book of the Dead."

38:47.537 --> 38:50.193
"Necromancer's Manual."

38:50.194 --> 38:52.466
Heavy stuff.

38:52.467 --> 38:56.020
Sir, earlier when you told Colonel Baird

38:56.021 --> 39:00.119
that she'd no longer
be concerned about Apep.

39:00.120 --> 39:02.040
We haven't seen the last of him.

39:02.041 --> 39:06.650
But I have a feeling
you knew that already.

39:06.651 --> 39:08.315
Years ago,

39:08.316 --> 39:10.460
Judson warned me that a war was coming.

39:10.461 --> 39:15.038
The "Ultimate Battle"
between good and evil.

39:15.039 --> 39:17.087
Test the true power of the Library.

39:17.088 --> 39:20.993
Eve felt it. I should've listened.

39:20.994 --> 39:24.035
So is the Ultimate Battle coming?

39:24.036 --> 39:27.781
Coming? No, sir.

39:27.782 --> 39:30.025
It has already begun.

39:31.656 --> 39:33.707
Careful, that's hot.
