01:19.317 --> 01:20.692
I've never seen the sea.

01:22.817 --> 01:24.025
Never seen the sea.

01:26.317 --> 01:29.442
I'm going with my boyfriend,
my sister and her fiance.

01:30.317 --> 01:33.275
He's ugly but funny.
My sister adores him.

01:33.942 --> 01:36.983
- Coming to the party?
- Yes. I love to dance.

01:37.775 --> 01:38.775
How about you?

01:41.733 --> 01:44.858
- Maybe. I don't know.
- How enthusiastic!

01:48.192 --> 01:49.567
I went away in June.

01:50.858 --> 01:52.358
Odd. Where did you go?

01:53.233 --> 01:54.233
You're really pale.

01:55.608 --> 01:58.817
She stayed at home in Paris
like some poor thing.

01:59.358 --> 02:00.358
Right, Dany?

02:02.733 --> 02:06.233
Get a sun lamp. They may cause
cancer but they work.

02:10.692 --> 02:12.150
I've never seen the sea.

02:14.400 --> 02:15.817
I've never seen the sea.

02:18.067 --> 02:21.692
The lady

02:22.358 --> 02:26.775
in the car

02:27.317 --> 02:34.275
with glasses

02:35.275 --> 02:41.608
and a gun

02:53.150 --> 02:55.525
- Sorry.
- No, it's your office.

02:56.108 --> 02:57.608
I wanted to ask you...

02:57.983 --> 03:00.317
I'm flying to Geneva to meet miikaby

03:00.525 --> 03:01.942
for the new campaign.

03:02.358 --> 03:06.150
Marty's damn report on
competition is a total mess.

03:07.233 --> 03:08.817
I rewrote a rough version.

03:10.275 --> 03:11.275
I understand.

03:13.067 --> 03:16.442
- How many pages is it?
- Fifty or so.

03:19.025 --> 03:20.483
To be done tonight?

03:21.858 --> 03:25.067
I may not manage it.
I do six pages an hour.

03:25.400 --> 03:26.483
If that...

03:27.567 --> 03:30.692
Why not ask Francine?
She's super-fast.

03:30.900 --> 03:35.525
She's fast but understands nothing.
I'm asking you, Dany.

03:36.692 --> 03:38.442
You were going to the party?

03:39.192 --> 03:42.817
I'll take that into account.
You could work at my place.

03:43.108 --> 03:44.817
- At your home?
- Yes.

03:45.233 --> 03:48.733
It'd help. My flight's at noon, I
wouldn't need to come here.

03:49.358 --> 03:50.900
We have a guest room.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.900
Anita will be glad.

03:57.358 --> 03:58.608
It's been ages.

04:00.108 --> 04:02.108
- Yes.
- How long exactly?

04:03.983 --> 04:05.025
Three and a half years.

04:06.233 --> 04:07.233
She talks about you.

04:08.525 --> 04:10.358
The wild things you got up to.

04:11.608 --> 04:12.650
She misses you.

04:16.608 --> 04:17.608
I'll be going soon.

04:18.567 --> 04:20.149
I can take you if you're ready.

04:21.442 --> 04:23.275
See you downstairs in ten minutes?

04:28.733 --> 04:29.733
Dany...

04:31.025 --> 04:33.567
Be discreet.
Not a word to the other girls.

04:35.983 --> 04:37.483
- All right.
- No one else.

04:38.858 --> 04:40.983
- All right, no one.
- That's it, no one.

04:42.608 --> 04:43.733
I'm counting on you.

04:58.692 --> 05:00.900
I've gone to see the sea Dany

05:21.525 --> 05:22.775
we'll stop at your place

05:23.525 --> 05:25.650
so you can change and
get your toiletries.

05:27.358 --> 05:28.983
I'm glad to see Anita again.

05:30.983 --> 05:33.275
We started at the agency
the same day.

05:35.150 --> 05:37.317
She made fun of me

05:37.525 --> 05:39.483
because she felt my dress was tacky.

05:42.150 --> 05:43.192
She was right.

05:47.567 --> 05:49.442
I'll see you back here?

05:50.400 --> 05:52.692
May I come up?
I need to call Anita.

05:53.525 --> 05:55.567
The place is a bit of a mess.

05:56.150 --> 05:57.650
I promise I won't look.

06:01.192 --> 06:03.067
I'll only be a minute or two.

06:07.525 --> 06:10.608
If you want a drink,
help yourself from the bar.

06:11.733 --> 06:12.733
Thank you.

06:22.233 --> 06:24.650
- Known Anita long?
- Eight years.

06:25.608 --> 06:28.192
We were at the same
secretarial school.

06:30.108 --> 06:32.608
She was the best.
She got everything she wanted.

06:34.358 --> 06:37.525
- We called her "Anita-screw-you".
- Really?

06:39.108 --> 06:41.233
- You didn't know?
- No.

06:44.067 --> 06:45.192
We won't be long now.

06:46.942 --> 06:48.442
Half an hour or so.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.400
No, she hasn't changed.

06:52.817 --> 06:55.400
Slim, with flaming red hair.

06:58.608 --> 06:59.983
You'll recognize her.

07:00.817 --> 07:01.942
See you later, honey.

07:17.817 --> 07:21.317
We'll buy you some food. There
isn't much at home, I fear.

07:22.692 --> 07:24.983
- We're not eating together?
- No.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.108
Anita and I are going out tonight.

07:29.942 --> 07:31.317
Sorry, I thought...

07:33.400 --> 07:35.442
I don't know what I thought.

08:04.567 --> 08:05.817
Hello, Sylvie sweetheart.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.983
- Say hello to Dany.
- How old is she?

08:11.275 --> 08:12.275
I'm three.

08:13.567 --> 08:15.567
Drat, I forgot my coat.

08:16.108 --> 08:19.317
- I had a little present for you.
- Come on.

08:34.357 --> 08:35.857
Here you go.

08:36.442 --> 08:38.857
- A French keyboard?
- Ls that a problem?

08:39.317 --> 08:41.525
Don't worry, I'll do my best.

08:42.357 --> 08:43.357
Do your best.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.400
- The famous report.
- Thank you.

09:00.442 --> 09:01.900
Is it legible?

09:03.858 --> 09:04.858
Yes..

09:07.025 --> 09:10.483
How can a man as tall as you
have such tiny handwriting?

09:12.442 --> 09:13.483
How amusing.

09:15.483 --> 09:17.108
I won't stay any longer.

09:17.608 --> 09:19.817
Anita will be down to see you soon.

09:22.608 --> 09:23.650
Do you need anything?

09:24.483 --> 09:26.358
No, I don't think so.

09:26.817 --> 09:27.942
Work well then.

09:37.942 --> 09:39.108
Coo-ee!

10:06.733 --> 10:08.150
It's been ages.

10:08.358 --> 10:11.358
- Yes. How are you?
- My head's killing me.

10:15.983 --> 10:16.983
What is it?

10:18.525 --> 10:20.650
Nothing. Just looking at you.

10:27.108 --> 10:28.108
Lt suits you.

10:30.858 --> 10:32.692
Yes, thank you. That's kind.

10:33.275 --> 10:37.775
A bit extravagant, but I was lucky.
I got it at a good price

10:46.942 --> 10:48.358
I'll show you the bathroom.

10:58.775 --> 11:00.317
You have a beautiful home.

11:01.733 --> 11:04.442
And your daughter's really adorable.

11:04.983 --> 11:06.775
She looks so much like you.

11:08.525 --> 11:09.567
I put a towel out for you.

11:11.025 --> 11:12.025
Thank you.

11:15.108 --> 11:17.192
Sorry to ask, but I'm so silly...

11:17.525 --> 11:19.692
I forgot my nightdress.

11:20.108 --> 11:21.400
Could you lend me one?

11:24.108 --> 11:25.108
Take this.

11:27.067 --> 11:29.275
No, it's far too pretty.

11:30.317 --> 11:32.067
Really, take it. I have others.

11:34.108 --> 11:36.567
Sorry, I have to get ready. I'm late.

11:43.483 --> 11:45.733
Don't stop. I'll just put this down

11:46.317 --> 11:47.650
over here and I'll go.

11:54.358 --> 11:57.858
We'll leave you. I'm taking Sylvie
to her grandma's,

11:58.317 --> 12:00.150
then joining Michel
at his cocktail party.

12:00.650 --> 12:01.650
All right.

12:01.942 --> 12:03.775
We'll be back late... Sylvie.

12:04.608 --> 12:06.275
Sylvie! Come here.

12:07.400 --> 12:10.358
Don't wait up.
I'll see you in the morning.

12:10.608 --> 12:11.775
I'll be fine.

12:12.275 --> 12:15.108
- Need anything else?
- I'd love a cigarette.

12:17.525 --> 12:19.233
- Keep the pack.
- Thank you.

12:20.483 --> 12:21.483
Come on.

12:22.983 --> 12:24.192
Bye, Sylvie.

14:53.858 --> 14:55.525
Anita, make an effort, dammit!

14:56.317 --> 14:58.775
Please, spare me these
fucking cocktail parties!

15:00.025 --> 15:01.608
Dany? Are you asleep?

15:02.108 --> 15:04.817
- Dany, are you OK?
- Yes, I'm fine.

15:05.567 --> 15:09.483
- I have 15 pages to go.
- Sleep now. Finish tomorrow.

15:09.942 --> 15:11.025
All right.

15:32.692 --> 15:34.650
I've brought you coffee.

16:08.317 --> 16:11.275
Wow, this little outfit suits me!

16:17.733 --> 16:18.983
Did it cost a lot?

16:25.025 --> 16:26.567
He bought it for me.

16:30.775 --> 16:32.692
He loves buying me gifts.

16:34.983 --> 16:36.608
He's completely mad!

16:38.192 --> 16:39.275
He adores me.

16:43.150 --> 16:46.317
Yes, I'm off to the riviera with him.

16:48.067 --> 16:51.483
His parents are buying us a yacht
as a wedding present.

17:06.567 --> 17:09.442
You're just a pathetic secretary,
blind as a bat.

17:33.650 --> 17:35.025
I've just finished.

17:36.108 --> 17:37.108
Excellent.

17:47.775 --> 17:49.233
Here you are, Mr. Caravaille.

17:51.900 --> 17:53.817
Your August bonus and a little extra.

17:56.733 --> 17:58.067
- Thank you.
- It's as agreed.

18:00.108 --> 18:01.108
Impossible.

19:03.775 --> 19:04.775
Impossible.

19:05.983 --> 19:08.525
- Why?
- I don't know. Because...

19:08.733 --> 19:12.608
Don't be silly. Come on,
we have to pick Sylvie up too.

19:12.817 --> 19:13.817
What's going on?

20:25.233 --> 20:27.733
- Thank you.
- How do I change gears?

20:27.942 --> 20:31.358
It's an automatic.
P to park, R to reverse,

20:31.733 --> 20:35.442
- N is neutral, D to drive.
- Sorry, I'm not used to it.

20:35.650 --> 20:38.400
Are you delaying us
or trying to be smart?

20:39.275 --> 20:42.025
Our number in Switzerland
if you need us.

20:42.567 --> 20:44.067
We have to go now. Goodbye.

22:27.317 --> 22:28.358
Dany...

22:30.317 --> 22:31.650
What are you after?

22:32.150 --> 22:33.442
Trying to be clever?

22:42.650 --> 22:44.650
You poor thing...

22:58.942 --> 23:03.275
No one will mind if you keep
the car an extra hour or two.

23:24.692 --> 23:26.775
Could you come to Orly with us?

23:29.275 --> 23:31.275
Then bring the car back here.

23:32.692 --> 23:33.942
I've never seen the sea.

23:34.192 --> 23:35.192
As agreed.

23:36.108 --> 23:37.233
I've never seen the sea.

23:37.650 --> 23:39.192
Stop complicating things.

23:39.608 --> 23:40.942
I've never seen the sea.

23:42.525 --> 23:44.525
I'm asking you, Dany.

23:44.983 --> 23:47.317
Then bring the car back here.

23:48.567 --> 23:49.942
I've never seen the sea.

24:44.525 --> 24:45.733
A perfect fit.

24:47.483 --> 24:50.900
Sorry to pry, but I saw
you arrive in your car...

24:51.400 --> 24:53.608
Are you an actress by any chance?

24:54.192 --> 24:55.317
I'm in advertising.

24:56.525 --> 24:59.192
- I run an ad agency.
- I knew it.

25:05.775 --> 25:06.983
Thank you.

25:07.192 --> 25:09.733
Here... a little present.

25:10.150 --> 25:11.150
Thank you.

25:34.942 --> 25:35.942
Feeling better?

25:38.942 --> 25:41.650
I ran after you to give
you your coat earlier.

25:42.483 --> 25:44.983
Sorry, I think you have
the wrong person.

25:45.608 --> 25:47.983
No, you had breakfast in my cafe.

25:48.442 --> 25:49.942
You forgot your coat.

25:50.483 --> 25:52.483
You're missing me up
with someone else.

25:53.108 --> 25:55.150
No, not at all.

25:56.358 --> 25:58.483
I could tell you weren't
feeling well.

25:59.108 --> 26:01.525
And you left your coat on your chair.

26:02.817 --> 26:06.150
You're very kind, but I promise
you it wasn't me.

26:06.567 --> 26:08.025
I was in Paris this morning.

26:09.525 --> 26:12.525
Your car had a problem
with its lights.

26:12.983 --> 26:14.983
So it's because of the car.

26:15.567 --> 26:16.942
Hers was the same.

26:17.650 --> 26:19.650
It was you I saw in my cafe.

26:20.108 --> 26:21.817
I never saw your car.

26:24.608 --> 26:27.733
I'm sorry, it was someone else.
Goodbye.

26:41.108 --> 26:42.525
You feel guilty.

26:43.025 --> 26:44.775
Trying to scare yourself?

26:50.692 --> 26:53.650
Who'll come looking on a bank holiday

26:53.858 --> 26:56.358
for some car that
hasn't even been stolen?

27:00.567 --> 27:02.317
Take the car back Tuesday.

27:04.733 --> 27:05.942
Have it cleaned.

27:07.358 --> 27:09.025
No one will ever know.

27:11.942 --> 27:12.942
No one.

27:53.775 --> 27:54.983
Fill it up, please.

27:55.775 --> 27:56.775
Sure, right away.

28:40.817 --> 28:42.233
Coffee, please.

29:00.567 --> 29:01.692
How much?

29:02.400 --> 29:03.483
One franc 30.

29:04.400 --> 29:06.150
No, it's on us.

29:06.692 --> 29:08.067
Thank you, but no.

29:08.275 --> 29:10.067
It's OK. The pleasure's ours.

29:17.067 --> 29:19.567
Hey. What are you doing?
Let's get going!

29:35.067 --> 29:38.650
Catch me and I'll give you
back your flowers, promise!

30:24.025 --> 30:25.275
I've never seen the sea.

30:26.025 --> 30:27.442
Never seen the sea.

31:27.983 --> 31:28.983
Madam?

31:33.108 --> 31:35.150
Are you all right, madam?

31:36.108 --> 31:37.108
Madam...

31:45.233 --> 31:46.233
Are you OK?

31:51.483 --> 31:52.775
Have you been robbed?

32:04.317 --> 32:05.317
Here...

32:09.150 --> 32:11.192
Come on now. We'll look after you.

32:17.400 --> 32:19.108
- What happened?
- No idea.

32:19.317 --> 32:21.317
She says someone attacked her.

32:22.775 --> 32:24.733
Take the kid. She shouldn't be here.

32:34.900 --> 32:37.358
No one followed you in there.

32:37.567 --> 32:38.608
We were all here.

32:40.067 --> 32:43.192
Who knows what happened,
but we'd have seen the guy.

32:48.733 --> 32:50.650
He pounced on me.

32:51.692 --> 32:53.150
He grabbed me.

33:23.692 --> 33:24.942
Did he...

33:36.483 --> 33:38.442
He crushed my wrist!

34:03.608 --> 34:05.025
That's not true.

34:06.192 --> 34:08.108
You had that mark last night.

34:08.608 --> 34:10.525
I wasn't here last night.

34:11.483 --> 34:14.733
- I was in Paris.
- No, you were here at my garage.

34:16.692 --> 34:19.025
I don't know what you're playing at.

34:20.650 --> 34:23.942
- I was in Paris.
- I mended the car's brake lights.

34:24.108 --> 34:25.942
- That's not true.
- Lt is!

34:26.983 --> 34:29.817
You didn't want fuel,
your brake lights were out.

34:31.567 --> 34:33.317
You're mistaken.

34:33.525 --> 34:35.483
Mistaken, with a car like that?

34:36.233 --> 34:38.983
You're mixing up the two cars!

34:39.192 --> 34:40.775
I'm mixing nothing up!

34:41.108 --> 34:43.275
I changed the screws on the wires.

34:43.483 --> 34:45.275
You'll see they're my screws.

34:46.608 --> 34:49.067
That hand was bandaged
and you know it!

34:49.567 --> 34:52.150
You're left-handed but
you could drive anyway.

34:52.608 --> 34:55.025
Say what you like, but I'm no liar.

35:06.983 --> 35:09.650
I didn't have a bandage
when I got here.

35:10.942 --> 35:11.983
No.

35:14.733 --> 35:17.525
- Lt can't be me.
- You had it last night.

35:17.942 --> 35:19.775
I've never been here before.

35:22.608 --> 35:25.483
You're mistaking me for someone else.

35:31.775 --> 35:33.275
Let me find a doctor.

35:33.733 --> 35:37.192
- We'll send for him.
- No, I want to see him alone.

35:38.150 --> 35:41.108
- I'll go to a hospital.
- I want to hear what you say.

35:41.442 --> 35:44.150
Maybe you're making it up
to cause trouble.

35:51.108 --> 35:54.692
If you want to take the train,
we'll drive the car to Paris.

35:55.192 --> 35:57.025
Who says I want to go back to Paris?

35:57.942 --> 36:01.108
- No one.
- I'm going south to see the sea.

36:01.317 --> 36:03.567
The doctor said not
to drive like that.

36:04.900 --> 36:06.942
I was driving last night...

36:07.400 --> 36:10.358
Was my hand bandaged
then like it is now?

36:10.900 --> 36:11.900
Yes or no?

36:12.692 --> 36:13.775
What's changed?

36:20.900 --> 36:22.067
I owe you for the fuel.

36:23.067 --> 36:24.275
- Here.
- Too much.

36:24.483 --> 36:26.900
- For your trouble.
- Thank you.

36:30.692 --> 36:33.692
Forgive me,
I lost control last night.

36:34.442 --> 36:36.608
You're so attractive.

36:42.442 --> 36:43.650
It wasn't me.

36:44.317 --> 36:45.983
So? I apologized.

36:46.233 --> 36:48.317
Anyone can make a mistake.

36:50.650 --> 36:52.692
Help me out, shake my hand.

36:54.817 --> 36:56.650
My daughter's watching us.

37:05.775 --> 37:08.483
Her name's Maureen.
She's the apple of my eye.

37:27.358 --> 37:30.650
See the little lights, honey?
Daddy mended them.

38:01.317 --> 38:02.317
What's wrong?

38:04.900 --> 38:06.525
What are you afraid of?

38:09.483 --> 38:11.358
That people will think you're crazy?

38:51.650 --> 38:53.150
So, miss Doremus..

38:54.108 --> 38:55.317
Out again, are we?

39:04.275 --> 39:05.733
A short circuit, was it?

39:06.608 --> 39:07.942
They're working now.

39:09.483 --> 39:11.400
You had them fixed in Paris?

39:12.483 --> 39:13.650
I'm talking to you.

39:14.692 --> 39:16.567
Did you have them fixed in Paris?

39:21.650 --> 39:22.650
Where?

39:33.108 --> 39:34.608
Can you take off your glasses?

39:42.900 --> 39:44.775
You drive in those at night?

39:48.400 --> 39:50.733
I'm short-sighted. I broke my others.

39:51.317 --> 39:54.608
It's dangerous, especially with
an injured hand.

39:56.317 --> 39:57.900
Where are you going now?

40:01.817 --> 40:02.900
Down south.

40:03.817 --> 40:04.817
Where?

40:06.608 --> 40:07.608
Monte Carlo.

40:08.525 --> 40:09.942
Not in one go, surely?

40:13.650 --> 40:16.025
I'll stop at a hotel
a bit further on.

40:16.483 --> 40:17.608
La renaissance?

40:18.692 --> 40:22.150
You told me you stayed at
la renaissance in Chalon, right?

40:22.442 --> 40:23.483
I don't know.

40:36.400 --> 40:37.900
I'm tired, that's all.

40:41.650 --> 40:43.275
Rut your glasses on, miss Dordmus.

40:43.483 --> 40:46.608
Follow me to Chalon.
I'll lead the way.

40:49.317 --> 40:50.858
How does he know my name?

40:51.942 --> 40:53.192
He can't know it.

40:54.067 --> 40:55.483
He can...

40:56.400 --> 41:00.317
I must have given my papers
to the doctor.

41:02.192 --> 41:05.775
Or I told them my name at the garage.

41:07.900 --> 41:09.358
I can't remember.

41:11.442 --> 41:12.692
They're in on this together.

41:16.150 --> 41:18.108
I know what I did this morning.

41:32.317 --> 41:35.483
You're passing through a dream, Dany.

41:41.150 --> 41:43.358
And it's someone else's dream.

42:13.150 --> 42:15.775
Know what? You'll go to this hotel.

42:16.108 --> 42:19.900
You'll sleep and take the car
back to Paris tomorrow.

42:20.983 --> 42:23.650
And everything
will get back to normal.

42:24.442 --> 42:26.692
- All right?
- All right.

42:34.692 --> 42:36.400
I'll see the sea some other time.

42:45.692 --> 42:46.692
Good evening.

42:47.192 --> 42:49.275
- Good evening.
- Can I help you?

42:50.150 --> 42:52.858
- I'd like a room for the night.
- Just tonight?

42:53.358 --> 42:54.358
Yes.

42:54.692 --> 42:57.400
Could you fill out this form?

42:59.983 --> 43:01.608
You write with that hand?

43:02.025 --> 43:03.858
I'll do it for you then.

43:04.567 --> 43:05.692
Dany Doremus.

43:07.025 --> 43:08.233
You don't recognize me?

43:08.900 --> 43:10.233
Why? Should I?

43:11.983 --> 43:14.650
I think I stayed here yesterday.

43:15.108 --> 43:17.400
Sorry, it was my night off.

43:17.692 --> 43:20.067
- Could you check?
- Check?

43:20.400 --> 43:23.942
- That I stayed here.
- I believe you...

43:24.192 --> 43:28.233
I'm asking you to check.
You must have records, right?

43:29.400 --> 43:30.442
Yes, of course.

43:32.400 --> 43:33.442
Dany Doremus.

43:36.442 --> 43:37.692
Yes, here we are...

43:39.108 --> 43:40.525
It's dated today.

43:41.358 --> 43:44.567
Because you arrived
in the night, that's why.

43:44.775 --> 43:46.817
No need to fill out another.

43:50.567 --> 43:51.567
Thank you.

44:08.192 --> 44:09.317
You took your time.

44:10.608 --> 44:13.442
- Shall we?
- Don't say you've seen me before.

44:13.650 --> 44:14.775
I'm sick of it!

44:18.067 --> 44:19.483
Let's not stay out here.

44:20.775 --> 44:22.358
Get off my car, please.

44:22.650 --> 44:24.608
- Maybe it's not yours.
- Really?

44:25.358 --> 44:26.942
I checked the papers.

44:28.608 --> 44:31.442
Will you please be nice? Get down.

44:31.983 --> 44:34.567
I need to be in
Cannes tomorrow. Urgently.

44:35.192 --> 44:36.692
Could you take me, please?

44:49.442 --> 44:51.108
I disconnected the battery.

44:51.442 --> 44:53.233
So no Cannes then?

44:53.442 --> 44:55.442
I'm not going there. I lied.

45:04.442 --> 45:05.567
May I? Thank you.

45:08.150 --> 45:09.858
I sail from Marseilles..

45:10.817 --> 45:12.900
On the 15th for Guinea.

45:13.483 --> 45:17.233
- An oil company has hired me.
- Congratulations.

45:18.025 --> 45:21.108
- You can send me a postcard.
- What's your name?

45:23.275 --> 45:24.275
Dany.

45:25.067 --> 45:26.150
I'm Georges.

45:27.192 --> 45:28.192
Really?

45:28.733 --> 45:31.817
- Why? I don't look like a Georges?
- No.

45:32.025 --> 45:33.025
I don't?

45:35.692 --> 45:36.692
Want one?

45:38.817 --> 45:39.817
Take it.

45:43.275 --> 45:44.275
Thank you.

45:45.608 --> 45:47.317
I feel like I'm going...

45:49.775 --> 45:50.775
Say it.

45:51.108 --> 45:53.108
I think I'm going mad.

45:55.608 --> 45:57.067
May I see my form, please?

45:58.317 --> 45:59.317
Of course.

46:03.483 --> 46:04.483
Thank you.

46:06.150 --> 46:07.317
It's not my writing.

46:09.442 --> 46:12.108
Maybe you couldn't write.

46:15.608 --> 46:18.025
Doremus, Danielle Marie Mirginie.

46:18.900 --> 46:21.692
- Ls that you or not?
- I've never been here before.

46:22.025 --> 46:24.942
Sorry, I don't understand.

46:25.483 --> 46:27.775
- Aren't you taking the room?
- I am.

46:28.775 --> 46:31.775
Of course.
I was just trying to be clever.

46:32.192 --> 46:33.358
I'll take two.

46:33.567 --> 46:36.400
I'd have liked a tub in my room too.

46:38.233 --> 46:39.567
To relax in.

46:40.483 --> 46:43.608
You can sleep in the car
if you're not happy.

46:45.025 --> 46:48.692
Or with you. It'd save money
and I could take a bath.

46:50.358 --> 46:51.650
And I'd scrub your back?

46:52.608 --> 46:54.817
Yes, that'd be perfect.

46:59.483 --> 47:00.483
Nice room.

47:04.942 --> 47:07.150
This isn't my bag.
Where did you find it?

47:07.692 --> 47:08.692
It's mine.

47:09.400 --> 47:10.775
What a nerve!

47:13.858 --> 47:14.942
We're going.

47:40.525 --> 47:42.150
My room is really small.

47:51.192 --> 47:52.858
You see that vase?

47:54.525 --> 47:58.358
Get out right now or i'll smash it
over your head.

48:22.817 --> 48:23.817
Have one.

48:24.067 --> 48:25.567
Want to know what I think?

48:28.108 --> 48:29.108
It's a trick.

48:30.067 --> 48:31.067
What is?

48:31.733 --> 48:33.817
- A trick on you.
- You think so?

48:35.150 --> 48:36.858
What else could it be?

48:37.775 --> 48:41.317
Don't be afraid.
You're being fooled, that's all.

49:37.275 --> 49:39.608
Who'd play a trick like this?

49:39.900 --> 49:42.608
- Where did he take your flowers?
- Near Auxerre.

49:43.233 --> 49:44.650
A trucker, right?

49:44.858 --> 49:46.317
- Yes.
- So that's it.

49:46.525 --> 49:48.358
They talk by radio.

49:48.650 --> 49:50.233
They all have cb now.

49:50.442 --> 49:51.442
Cb?

49:53.233 --> 49:56.400
They saw you in your big car,
found you pretty

49:56.858 --> 49:58.900
and played a trick on you for fun.

49:59.317 --> 50:00.567
Call this funny?

50:01.525 --> 50:04.483
A trick can take a bad turn.

50:08.317 --> 50:11.983
They tried to scare you,
you fought back, you got hurt.

50:13.317 --> 50:15.067
- You think so?
- I'm sure.

50:41.108 --> 50:43.525
- The policeman...
- What?

50:43.817 --> 50:46.942
Could a policeman take part
in something this stupid?

50:47.192 --> 50:50.608
Why not? You think
policemen are smart?

50:54.233 --> 50:56.775
Let me see... what's your smile like?

51:03.192 --> 51:05.025
How do you see me now? Hazy?

51:07.692 --> 51:09.400
And if I come closer?

51:10.983 --> 51:12.067
Kiss me.

53:22.192 --> 53:23.400
Breakfast, madam.

53:39.025 --> 53:40.025
Thank you.

53:45.567 --> 53:46.733
Good morning.

53:50.233 --> 53:51.400
Good morning.

53:54.942 --> 53:56.525
You know you talk in your sleep?

53:58.067 --> 53:59.067
I talked?

54:01.108 --> 54:02.858
It sounded like a weird dream.

54:05.192 --> 54:06.317
I don't remember.

54:08.192 --> 54:09.733
Want to know what you said?

54:12.525 --> 54:13.525
No.

54:14.608 --> 54:15.817
No, i'd rather not.

54:17.233 --> 54:18.525
I have nightmares.

54:45.358 --> 54:47.275
- I'm georges.
- Really?

54:47.608 --> 54:49.650
Why? I don't look like a georges?

54:55.900 --> 54:58.358
I sail from marseilles on the 15th

54:58.567 --> 55:01.150
for Cairo.
An oil company has hired me.

55:49.525 --> 55:51.192
What's on your mind?

55:54.567 --> 55:56.108
Why did you pick my car?

55:58.442 --> 56:00.233
Lots of people head south.

56:01.317 --> 56:02.858
Because I liked you.

56:04.233 --> 56:06.858
- Because of the car?
- That too.

56:08.275 --> 56:09.983
Your little white outfit.

56:19.608 --> 56:20.817
You're upset?

56:22.233 --> 56:23.233
No.

56:53.692 --> 56:56.192
- You're driving too fast.
- You're scared?

57:27.108 --> 57:28.108
Come on.

57:35.067 --> 57:37.192
- Where are we going?
- Don't worry.

57:42.192 --> 57:43.608
Have you known many men?

57:45.108 --> 57:46.442
- A few.
- How many?

57:47.358 --> 57:50.567
How many? Three? Four?
Ten? A hundred?

57:52.483 --> 57:53.483
One.

57:54.025 --> 57:55.025
Just one?

57:56.275 --> 57:57.483
Only one who matters.

57:58.733 --> 57:59.817
He was your first?

58:03.192 --> 58:04.858
Answer me. Was he?

58:05.858 --> 58:06.858
Yes.

58:08.650 --> 58:10.233
It bothers you to say it?

58:11.150 --> 58:12.150
A little.

58:19.442 --> 58:20.525
When was it?

58:21.108 --> 58:22.108
Did he leave you?

58:24.692 --> 58:26.108
Why do you want to know?

58:26.442 --> 58:28.192
No reason. Just to know.

58:30.233 --> 58:31.233
Was it him or you?

58:32.233 --> 58:35.650
- No one left anyone.
- So why aren't you with him?

58:37.400 --> 58:39.442
- He didn't love you.
- He did.

58:39.858 --> 58:41.400
Not enough to stay.

58:42.692 --> 58:43.692
Was he married?

58:47.275 --> 58:48.650
You got pregnant?

58:49.233 --> 58:51.192
Why are you afraid to say it?
You had an abortion?

58:55.858 --> 58:58.900
- Do you often sleep with strangers?
- I'm not like that!

58:59.483 --> 59:01.608
So what did we do last night?

59:06.608 --> 59:08.692
I'll get the cigarettes from the car.

59:09.442 --> 59:10.942
I'll be right back.

59:49.483 --> 59:50.483
Is that you?

59:52.942 --> 59:53.942
Ls someone there?

01:01:15.108 --> 01:01:17.608
When did things start
going off the tracks?

01:01:21.150 --> 01:01:22.442
At the service station?

01:01:26.067 --> 01:01:29.567
Before then even, when that
woman spoke about my coat.

01:01:33.067 --> 01:01:35.275
There has to be a point
when it started.

01:02:29.817 --> 01:02:30.817
Hello.

01:02:33.817 --> 01:02:35.067
Do you have a Cb?

01:02:35.275 --> 01:02:37.775
Yes, I have a Cb. Why do you ask?

01:02:38.108 --> 01:02:39.525
Can I ask a favor?

01:02:39.733 --> 01:02:41.858
A quick one.
I have to pick up a load.

01:02:44.650 --> 01:02:45.775
What's your favor?

01:02:52.775 --> 01:02:55.692
We're looking for a green
Thunderbird. You can't miss it.

01:02:56.692 --> 01:02:58.525
A red one's just behind me.

01:02:59.025 --> 01:03:01.108
Green, he said. Clean your ears

01:03:01.317 --> 01:03:04.108
- yes, green.
- Sorry, mine's red.

01:03:04.858 --> 01:03:07.817
A blue American car passed me
an hour ago,

01:03:08.067 --> 01:03:09.108
going at top speed.

01:03:09.567 --> 01:03:11.650
- Where?
- Near Brignoles.

01:03:11.858 --> 01:03:13.858
What are you doing there?

01:03:14.108 --> 01:03:15.942
Give us a break, castor!

01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:19.400
Did anyone else see it
near Brignoles or Frejus?

01:03:19.650 --> 01:03:22.233
- No, nothing to report.
- No.

01:03:22.442 --> 01:03:24.067
I haven't seen it, baby.

01:03:25.025 --> 01:03:27.192
Someone saw it near Brignoles.

01:03:28.275 --> 01:03:30.567
I think it's about to pass me.

01:03:30.775 --> 01:03:32.483
- Where?
- ViLlefranche.

01:03:32.692 --> 01:03:35.233
- Stick with it.
- So buy me a Ferrari.

01:03:54.525 --> 01:03:56.192
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:57.608
Goodbye.

01:05:02.608 --> 01:05:03.733
Madam...

01:05:05.525 --> 01:05:06.900
Ls this your car?

01:05:10.067 --> 01:05:12.442
- Yes.
- Can I get in?

01:05:13.025 --> 01:05:14.650
I don't think
your parents won't agree.

01:05:14.858 --> 01:05:16.275
They will.

01:05:16.733 --> 01:05:18.858
- What's your name?
- Bertrand.

01:05:20.358 --> 01:05:22.650
How do you do? I'm Dany.

01:05:23.608 --> 01:05:25.567
Who's the man in your car?

01:05:26.483 --> 01:05:29.317
- There isn't a man.
- There is, in the back.

01:05:31.983 --> 01:05:34.400
- Where?
- There.

01:05:53.233 --> 01:05:54.275
He's asleep.

01:06:18.650 --> 01:06:19.942
It's not possible.

01:06:21.067 --> 01:06:22.358
You didn't see properly.

01:06:23.233 --> 01:06:24.483
The trunk's empty.

01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:31.442
Stop, shit!
You don't know where you're going!

01:06:33.608 --> 01:06:35.900
I'll go to the police.

01:06:36.733 --> 01:06:38.817
That's the sensible thing to do.

01:06:39.817 --> 01:06:41.442
What'll you tell them?

01:06:41.983 --> 01:06:44.442
That you picked up a killer

01:06:44.650 --> 01:06:47.108
who dumped a corpse
in the car you stole?

01:06:49.733 --> 01:06:52.108
Want to know the truth, Dany?

01:06:52.358 --> 01:06:53.358
Yes.

01:06:53.692 --> 01:06:55.025
It's all in your mind.

01:06:55.317 --> 01:06:56.567
All in your mind.

01:06:57.150 --> 01:06:58.775
None of this really exists.

01:06:59.608 --> 01:07:00.858
It's all in my mind.

01:07:31.817 --> 01:07:32.817
Follow me!

01:08:09.775 --> 01:08:12.400
- Ls he still in there?
- Where else?

01:08:13.567 --> 01:08:16.524
- Who is he?
- You tell me that!

01:08:16.858 --> 01:08:20.024
Don't play this game!
You risk more than I do.

01:08:21.317 --> 01:08:23.817
- What'll you do?
- I want to understand.

01:08:33.108 --> 01:08:35.024
- He lent it to you?
- He doesn't know I took lt.

01:08:38.524 --> 01:08:41.067
Someone put him there. Lt wasn't me.

01:08:41.567 --> 01:08:43.317
He was dead before I met you.

01:08:44.024 --> 01:08:45.733
- Says who?
- I can see.

01:08:45.942 --> 01:08:48.233
He hasn't breathed for a while.

01:08:49.358 --> 01:08:51.899
You could've put him there
way after killing him.

01:08:57.024 --> 01:09:00.399
- He was in my bag?
- You could've got up in the night.

01:09:04.399 --> 01:09:05.399
Listen...

01:09:10.317 --> 01:09:11.567
I stole your car

01:09:12.192 --> 01:09:15.317
to sell to a guy I know here.
I may be a thief...

01:09:15.817 --> 01:09:18.442
And a bastard, but i'm not a killer!

01:09:23.692 --> 01:09:25.942
Could your boss be a bit of a killer?

01:09:27.483 --> 01:09:29.858
Maybe the stiff
was already in the car.

01:09:30.067 --> 01:09:32.108
- The trunk was empty.
- You opened it?

01:09:32.817 --> 01:09:33.858
Yes, several times.

01:09:36.649 --> 01:09:38.608
It's a hard story to swallow.

01:09:42.649 --> 01:09:44.817
Did you kill him with the shotgun?

01:09:50.692 --> 01:09:51.774
What shotgun?

01:09:52.024 --> 01:09:53.192
Cut it out, Dany!

01:09:56.025 --> 01:09:57.067
Well then?

01:10:01.025 --> 01:10:02.025
You see it now?

01:10:04.025 --> 01:10:05.483
It's nothing to do with you?

01:10:06.692 --> 01:10:07.692
I swear.

01:10:14.942 --> 01:10:17.317
Know what we're going to do?
The same thing...

01:10:17.858 --> 01:10:20.567
As the bastard who put
him in your trunk.

01:10:30.275 --> 01:10:33.358
We dump him here and
forget all about him!

01:10:50.442 --> 01:10:53.233
Follow my motorbike
to the marseilles docks.

01:10:54.233 --> 01:10:55.733
Then we'll sail to Cairo.

01:11:05.192 --> 01:11:06.192
It's over.

01:11:08.817 --> 01:11:09.817
I'm here.

01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:17.900
Hold on a second.

01:11:28.733 --> 01:11:29.733
Have you seen this?

01:11:31.858 --> 01:11:32.858
What is it?

01:11:40.233 --> 01:11:41.275
What is this?

01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:45.525
Who signed this? Who signed it?!

01:11:49.733 --> 01:11:50.733
Stop!

01:12:53.192 --> 01:12:56.608
Let me come to you.
I can't live without you.

01:12:58.025 --> 01:13:01.275
I never wrote it.
I don't know the guy.

01:13:01.733 --> 01:13:04.025
- That's not true.
- Lt can't be me.

01:13:04.275 --> 01:13:07.692
- I don't understand.
- Stop talking this rubbish.

01:13:08.025 --> 01:13:10.692
- What's wrong?
- I saw you weren't well.

01:13:10.983 --> 01:13:13.400
I'm just tired. You're mistaken.

01:13:13.608 --> 01:13:14.983
No, not at all.

01:13:15.192 --> 01:13:18.108
Doremus, Danielle Marie Virginie.
Is that you?

01:13:18.317 --> 01:13:20.858
You're mixing me up
with someone else.

01:13:27.025 --> 01:13:28.067
Mincenzo?

01:13:46.775 --> 01:13:47.817
Mincenzo?

01:13:54.567 --> 01:13:55.775
Mincenzo!

01:14:28.358 --> 01:14:29.358
Anita?

01:14:30.650 --> 01:14:33.775
- Yes.
- Lt's Dany. It's terrible.

01:14:34.858 --> 01:14:35.983
Really terrible.

01:14:37.233 --> 01:14:38.817
Where on earth are you?

01:14:40.108 --> 01:14:41.275
I'm lost.

01:14:41.775 --> 01:14:43.233
Dany, what's going on?

01:14:48.108 --> 01:14:49.358
I killed someone.

01:14:50.483 --> 01:14:51.483
My god...

01:14:51.692 --> 01:14:54.608
It's my fault. lt's all my fault.

01:14:55.775 --> 01:14:58.025
It's horrible.
I don't know what I'm doing.

01:15:01.775 --> 01:15:03.775
I swear I didn't mean any harm.

01:15:07.817 --> 01:15:09.608
I'm scared. I'm so scared.

01:15:10.442 --> 01:15:11.567
We're going to help you.

01:15:12.192 --> 01:15:13.192
You hear?

01:15:14.233 --> 01:15:16.775
- Do you know where you are?
- No, I don't.

01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:20.942
Near.... near nice. Millefranche.

01:15:21.275 --> 01:15:22.442
Miilefranche?

01:15:24.025 --> 01:15:27.733
- Why are you down there?
- Sorry, I didn't bring the car back.

01:15:28.733 --> 01:15:29.983
I took the car.

01:15:31.150 --> 01:15:32.275
I shouldn't have.

01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:36.275
- I'm being punished.
- Calm down. Release. Listen to me.

01:15:39.192 --> 01:15:42.567
If you're in ViLlefranche,
you're near a friend's house.

01:15:43.817 --> 01:15:44.983
It's in Antibes.

01:15:46.692 --> 01:15:47.817
Go to his place.

01:15:49.025 --> 01:15:51.983
- I don't know if I can.
- Obey, Dany, go there.

01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:54.358
Do as I say, Dany.

01:15:54.775 --> 01:15:57.775
Follow the coast until
a sign for belle-rive.

01:15:58.567 --> 01:16:01.192
The house is empty
but the gate stays open.

01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:03.108
The key's just above the door.

01:16:05.025 --> 01:16:06.983
- You'll remember that?
- Yes.

01:16:10.858 --> 01:16:13.483
Lock yourself in.
You'll be safe there.

01:16:15.442 --> 01:16:17.525
Michel's leaving now
to join you there.

01:16:18.275 --> 01:16:21.358
Forgive me...

01:17:10.733 --> 01:17:12.733
You're trying to drive me mad.

01:17:13.275 --> 01:17:14.942
I've never been here before.

01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:32.233
Drat, I forgot my coat.
I had a little present for you.

01:17:35.775 --> 01:17:37.150
I don't believe it...

01:17:47.067 --> 01:17:48.400
I know you're there.

01:17:49.775 --> 01:17:51.483
The woman in the other car.

01:17:55.692 --> 01:17:56.983
She was injured.

01:17:58.858 --> 01:18:00.733
That's why you attacked me.

01:18:03.442 --> 01:18:04.775
So I'd be like her.

01:18:07.317 --> 01:18:11.400
From the beginning, you made her
follow the same road as me.

01:18:13.442 --> 01:18:17.317
She went everywhere before me.
Making people believe she was me.

01:18:21.692 --> 01:18:23.692
No, Dany, that's impossible.

01:18:25.150 --> 01:18:28.108
No one could have known
you'd take that road.

01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:29.400
No one.

01:18:30.567 --> 01:18:33.983
Even I didn't know.
I was asked to take the car back.

01:18:40.608 --> 01:18:43.900
You were supposed to kill me
in Paris? Ls that it?

01:18:46.150 --> 01:18:47.358
Don't move!

01:18:52.817 --> 01:18:54.108
You'll spoil everything.

01:19:27.525 --> 01:19:28.733
I'm tired.

01:19:30.150 --> 01:19:32.317
I haven't slept since you left, Dany.

01:19:34.275 --> 01:19:37.525
Everything's fine.
You haven't killed anyone.

01:19:40.525 --> 01:19:42.942
You've both lied to me
from the beginning.

01:19:48.067 --> 01:19:49.400
It's not your fault, Dany.

01:19:50.275 --> 01:19:51.983
Anita had killed a man.

01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:55.192
They'd slept together.

01:19:55.608 --> 01:19:57.317
She'd had a lot to drink.

01:19:59.650 --> 01:20:02.317
His name was Kaub. Maurice Kaub.

01:20:05.067 --> 01:20:08.692
Ne was blackmailing her with photos
he said he'd send to me.

01:20:09.192 --> 01:20:11.817
Trivial and pathetic tableaux.

01:20:38.733 --> 01:20:39.775
I love Anita.

01:20:41.733 --> 01:20:44.983
I love her with the same pity
as my little girl for I know

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:49.067
she is genuinely and pathetically

01:20:49.317 --> 01:20:51.067
a little girl herself.

01:20:55.775 --> 01:20:59.067
I never contemplated
the idea of abandoning her,

01:20:59.275 --> 01:21:02.900
of letting her be jailed,
of letting her suffer all alone.

01:21:03.983 --> 01:21:07.442
In no time at all, I came up...

01:21:08.192 --> 01:21:10.108
With a scheme to save us.

01:21:10.817 --> 01:21:14.275
The more I thought about it,
the more perfect it seemed.

01:21:14.650 --> 01:21:16.942
Outlandish but perfect.

01:21:18.983 --> 01:21:20.817
You could work at my place.

01:21:21.483 --> 01:21:22.692
I have to go.

01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:23.942
Work well then.

01:21:35.192 --> 01:21:36.483
Anita would be safe.

01:21:44.150 --> 01:21:46.567
Don't stop.
I'll just put this down over here

01:21:47.358 --> 01:21:48.400
and i'll go.

01:21:49.525 --> 01:21:52.483
I replayed the murder,
killing Kaub a second time,

01:21:53.108 --> 01:21:54.108
far from Anita.

01:21:55.692 --> 01:21:57.608
- Bye, sylvie.
- See you tomorrow.

01:22:00.317 --> 01:22:08.317
Antibes

01:22:12.150 --> 01:22:14.358
there, I dressed her as you.

01:22:23.942 --> 01:22:26.025
I had the bandage idea...

01:22:26.650 --> 01:22:28.858
People remember such details.

01:22:29.317 --> 01:22:31.942
A woman in a thunderbird
with a bandaged hand.

01:22:38.483 --> 01:22:42.775
It was all eyewash.
No one pays any attention to anyone.

01:22:58.025 --> 01:23:00.650
Spare me your dumb cocktail parties

01:23:01.692 --> 01:23:03.483
make an effort, dammit

01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:05.567
Dany...

01:23:06.525 --> 01:23:09.650
- Are you asleep? Are you ok?
- I'm fine.

01:23:09.942 --> 01:23:11.942
My brake lights, please.

01:23:12.817 --> 01:23:14.233
15 pages to go.

01:23:14.442 --> 01:23:17.233
- Finish tomorrow. Sleep now.
- All right.

01:23:18.025 --> 01:23:19.233
There, all set.

01:23:19.942 --> 01:23:21.358
Great bodywork...

01:23:22.817 --> 01:23:23.858
Are you crazy?!

01:23:34.192 --> 01:23:38.025
The next morning,
Kaub's car was waiting for you outside.

01:23:39.067 --> 01:23:40.650
Your part began.

01:23:41.108 --> 01:23:43.817
- Where do I leave it?
- In the garden.

01:23:45.025 --> 01:23:46.358
We have to go.

01:23:52.650 --> 01:23:54.650
I said the fight was at midday.

01:23:55.067 --> 01:23:59.150
But I had two hours to follow you,
poison you

01:23:59.817 --> 01:24:02.275
and place your body next to Kaub's.

01:24:03.233 --> 01:24:06.442
It would've looked like suicide
after killing your lover.

01:24:09.442 --> 01:24:11.692
You're not mad.
You didn't kill anyone.

01:24:35.983 --> 01:24:37.650
I'm not mad.

01:24:49.233 --> 01:24:50.692
You didn't kill anyone.

01:24:58.067 --> 01:25:00.608
I'm sorry.
I don't know what came over me.

01:25:01.067 --> 01:25:02.400
It wasn't me.

01:25:20.317 --> 01:25:23.358
You were supposed to take
the car back to Paris.

01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:28.567
Instead, you turned off.

01:25:30.900 --> 01:25:32.358
I turned south.

01:25:36.608 --> 01:25:38.317
I just wanted to see the sea.

01:25:39.483 --> 01:25:43.775
You went back
along the same route as Anita.

01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:46.483
- Fill it up, please.
- Sure.

01:25:47.192 --> 01:25:50.233
Your double seemed to be guiding you.

01:25:54.192 --> 01:25:55.692
I followed you every step. Of the way,

01:26:20.025 --> 01:26:21.025
so you see...

01:26:23.067 --> 01:26:24.442
You didn't kill anyone.

01:26:25.858 --> 01:26:27.275
You didn't kill anyone.

01:26:32.275 --> 01:26:33.275
I'm sorry.

01:26:33.817 --> 01:26:36.775
I've always wanted to see the sea.
That's all.

01:29:08.650 --> 01:29:25.692
With glasses

01:29:26.305 --> 01:29:32.744
