WEBVTT

00:19.172 --> 00:20.585
- Ahhhh! Heyyy!

00:20.586 --> 00:21.999
You're blowin' hot air
in my eyes.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.551
- Ohhh, don't be
such a baby boy.

00:25.827 --> 00:29.758
- Owww owww, too hard, too hard!

00:31.896 --> 00:34.067
- Thanks.
My hair looks perfect.

00:34.068 --> 00:36.206
- No, you look like a monster.

00:37.344 --> 00:40.102
- Aw, come on...
We don't need all this.

00:40.103 --> 00:41.688
- Hey! We're about
to have what might be

00:41.689 --> 00:44.930
the most important meeting
that Game Shakers has ever had.

00:44.931 --> 00:46.688
- So?

00:46.689 --> 00:48.103
He said it.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.309
- So...

00:50.310 --> 00:53.723
Babe texted me and said:

00:53.724 --> 00:56.240
"Kenzie, make sure the boys
don't look disgusting

00:56.241 --> 00:58.102
on the video call."

00:58.103 --> 00:59.343
- Oh, please.

00:59.344 --> 01:02.275
This could never
look disgusting..

01:05.724 --> 01:06.861
- You got a bunch of nose hairs.

01:06.862 --> 01:08.378
- What?

01:08.379 --> 01:10.067
- Here, use this trimmer.

01:10.068 --> 01:12.999
- I don't think I wanna
use a nosehair trim...

01:13.000 --> 01:14.033
- Mmhmm...

01:14.034 --> 01:16.067
- Whoa, that feels nice.

01:16.068 --> 01:18.310
- Can I try it?
- Yeah, check it out.

01:21.758 --> 01:23.757
- Wooooo!

01:23.758 --> 01:26.551
Yeah! Work it.

01:28.034 --> 01:29.034
- Okay, my turn!

01:29.035 --> 01:31.205
Ahh...

01:31.206 --> 01:33.619
Yeah-heya, there it is.

01:33.620 --> 01:36.205
- All right, Hudson.

01:36.206 --> 01:37.826
I need you to set us up
for the video call.

01:37.827 --> 01:39.275
- No problem.

01:41.103 --> 01:43.343
Let's see...
we're gonna be calling...

01:43.344 --> 01:46.619
Scottsdale, Arizona...

01:46.620 --> 01:49.688
- Hudson, I told you,
we're calling Scotland.

01:49.689 --> 01:52.274
- which is in Arizona.

01:52.275 --> 01:54.654
- Nooooo.
Scotts-DALE is in Arizona.

01:54.655 --> 01:56.172
- So, we agree.

02:00.241 --> 02:01.723
- Five months!

02:01.724 --> 02:03.895
Do you guys realize
that's how long

02:03.896 --> 02:05.205
we've been working on the game?

02:05.206 --> 02:07.136
I mean, like,
I'm not even kidding,

02:07.137 --> 02:09.550
this is unbelievable!

02:09.551 --> 02:12.516
And ya know, I get that
it's just bad luck,

02:12.517 --> 02:13.826
and that it's nobody's fault...

02:13.827 --> 02:16.551
But still... man!

02:18.689 --> 02:20.412
Do you guys realize
how frustrating it is

02:20.413 --> 02:23.067
for all of us to have
worked this hard...

02:23.068 --> 02:25.136
and to finally get this meeting?

02:25.137 --> 02:27.309
And now we have nothing?!?

02:27.310 --> 02:30.482
I mean nothing, we have nothing!

02:33.137 --> 02:35.067
- We have orange juice.

02:35.068 --> 02:36.516
- I'm gonna' kill you.
- Ah ah ah!

02:36.517 --> 02:39.274
All right, you need
to take a deep breath

02:39.275 --> 02:41.205
and tell us what
you're freakin' out about.

02:41.206 --> 02:43.344
- Okay...

02:45.275 --> 02:46.757
Our game... our game idea

02:46.758 --> 02:49.757
that we've all
worked on for five months,

02:49.758 --> 02:51.412
that we're supposed
to pitch to Full Kilt

02:51.413 --> 02:52.688
in about 20 minutes...
what's it called?

02:52.689 --> 02:53.792
- Stroller Coaster.

02:53.793 --> 02:54.999
- And what's it about?

02:55.000 --> 02:56.688
- Babies on roller coasters.

02:56.689 --> 02:59.275
- Exactly.
Now, take a look at this...

03:01.931 --> 03:03.619
- Ah...
- Awww, no waaay!

03:03.620 --> 03:05.171
- Yep.

03:05.172 --> 03:08.516
Roller Babies is
a brand new game from TekMoto.

03:08.517 --> 03:10.792
- Wha-wha... so they stole
our game idea?!?

03:10.793 --> 03:12.412
- Nah, they didn't steal it.
I checked.

03:12.413 --> 03:14.274
They've had it in development
for over a year.

03:14.275 --> 03:17.655
- Ahhh.
So we stole it from them.

03:19.379 --> 03:21.067
- Nooo!
We didn't steal anything!

03:21.068 --> 03:23.861
- We just happened to think
of the same idea they did.

03:23.862 --> 03:24.999
Y'know, it happens.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.412
- Well, this is a problem.

03:28.413 --> 03:29.826
'Cuz we can't pitch our game

03:29.827 --> 03:32.240
if TekMoto already put out
a game just like it.

03:32.241 --> 03:34.517
- I understand the problem.

03:36.068 --> 03:37.724
- Well, now what?

03:38.931 --> 03:40.792
- You guys wanna go outside?

03:40.793 --> 03:43.862
Build a snow-woman?

03:46.620 --> 03:48.240
- Ahhhh!!!

03:48.241 --> 03:51.067
- Babe! Hey, Babe!
- Back off!

03:51.068 --> 03:55.136
- Look, why don't we just
postpone the video conference?

03:55.137 --> 03:56.619
- Nuh-uh, we can't.

03:56.620 --> 03:58.447
- We already postponed it once,
if we push it again

03:58.448 --> 04:00.378
they're gonna think we're lame.

04:00.379 --> 04:01.895
- Hehehe...
Hey...

04:01.896 --> 04:06.792
we could call ourselves
The Lame Shakers... Ha!

04:06.793 --> 04:09.067
Hehehehe...

04:09.068 --> 04:11.412
Soon too?

04:11.413 --> 04:12.930
- All right, all right, uh...

04:12.931 --> 04:14.654
Kenzie, how many minutes
'til our conference call?

04:14.655 --> 04:15.757
- Eighteen.

04:15.758 --> 04:19.447
- Eighteen, okay.
We can do this.

04:19.448 --> 04:22.309
We've got eighteen minutes
and our four brains to...

04:27.551 --> 04:29.826
And our three brains...

04:29.827 --> 04:31.516
to come up with
a new game concept

04:31.517 --> 04:33.516
to pitch to Full Kilt.
You guys up for it?

04:33.517 --> 04:35.343
- I'm in.
- Let's do it to it.

04:35.344 --> 04:37.447
- Cool, okay...
Now we have to concentrate.

04:37.448 --> 04:39.171
So everyone turn off
your phones,

04:39.172 --> 04:40.757
and focus all
your brain power on...

04:40.758 --> 04:43.412
- Problem!
- Dub's got a problem!

04:43.413 --> 04:46.447
- No!
- That's right!

04:46.448 --> 04:49.447
I got a big, fat, nasty problem!

04:49.448 --> 04:50.895
- Look Dub,
we have our own problem

04:50.896 --> 04:53.136
and it's much fatter
and nastier than yours,

04:53.137 --> 04:54.688
so there's no time... ah!

04:54.689 --> 04:57.136
- So, I wake up this mornin'...

04:57.137 --> 04:58.723
jump inside of my pool...

04:58.724 --> 05:00.274
and then I started floatin'
on my favorite raft...

05:00.275 --> 05:02.343
and guess what I see
up in one of my trees!

05:02.344 --> 05:04.619
- A leaf!
Was it a leaf?!?

05:04.620 --> 05:06.136
- No!

05:06.137 --> 05:07.378
- Well, actually Dub,

05:07.379 --> 05:09.240
there were a lotta leaves
in that tree.

05:09.241 --> 05:11.586
- So technically,
the boy's right.

05:12.620 --> 05:15.447
- I'm not talkin' about foliage!

05:15.448 --> 05:17.620
I'm talkin' about
that poppa-rottso!

05:19.413 --> 05:22.723
- Ya mean one of those
grilled sandwiches?

05:22.724 --> 05:25.033
- Are you thinkin' of a panini?

05:25.034 --> 05:27.447
- I am now.

05:27.448 --> 05:29.861
- A "paparazzo" is one
of those creepy photographers

05:29.862 --> 05:32.688
who sneak around, trying
to get pics of celebrities.

05:32.689 --> 05:35.033
- Yeah, and he took a pic of me!

05:35.034 --> 05:36.723
- Ah, who cares?

05:36.724 --> 05:37.861
- I care!

05:37.862 --> 05:39.447
That poppa-rottso
is gonna sell that photo

05:39.448 --> 05:40.861
to the internet,

05:40.862 --> 05:42.516
and the whole wide
world's gonna see...

05:42.517 --> 05:44.758
gonna see my...
my rump zone!

05:46.206 --> 05:47.378
- Well what do you care

05:47.379 --> 05:49.067
if people see your rump zone?

05:49.068 --> 05:51.102
- I wasn't...

05:51.103 --> 05:52.792
I wasn't wearin' a swimsuit.

05:52.793 --> 05:54.412
- Ohhhh.
- Ahhhhh.

05:54.413 --> 05:55.447
- I see.
- Naked.

05:55.448 --> 05:57.309
- Hey! How much time?

05:57.310 --> 05:58.310
- Sixteen minutes.

05:58.311 --> 06:00.033
- All right guys,

06:00.034 --> 06:01.619
seriously, you gotta go.

06:01.620 --> 06:03.033
- Wait, wait.
You can't make me go.

06:03.034 --> 06:04.792
I happen to be an equal partner
in this business.

06:04.793 --> 06:07.516
- Okay. You can stay...
- if you wanna help us work.

06:07.517 --> 06:09.309
- Bunny! Ruthless!

06:09.310 --> 06:10.895
Wanna' go get
some breakfast burritos?

06:10.896 --> 06:13.757
- Okay!
- I'd love a breakfast burrito!

06:13.758 --> 06:15.274
- Ok cool!
Come on, let's go.

06:15.275 --> 06:16.688
- Hey, in my burrito,

06:16.689 --> 06:18.378
can I get some of that
"chorizo" sausage?

06:18.379 --> 06:19.964
- Dang it, Bunny!

06:19.965 --> 06:23.688
There's more to life
than "chorizo" sausage!

06:23.689 --> 06:26.274
- Bun, ya gotta stop thinking
about that "chorizo" sausage.

06:26.275 --> 06:28.000
- I know.

06:30.206 --> 06:32.758

07:18.379 --> 07:20.723
- Ahhh, 13 minutes
and 35 seconds.

07:20.724 --> 07:22.343
- Okay. Is everyone ready

07:22.344 --> 07:23.550
to think of an awesome new game?

07:23.551 --> 07:24.517
- Yes ma'am!
- Absolutely.

07:24.518 --> 07:26.654
- Okay, now remember:

07:26.655 --> 07:28.102
Be as creative as
you possibly can,

07:28.103 --> 07:29.826
and pitch anything
that pops into your brain.

07:29.827 --> 07:31.309
- Let's do this.
- All right.

07:31.310 --> 07:33.067
- Okay, um...

07:33.068 --> 07:36.067
Okay, what if the game starts
on the planet Jupiter, and...

07:37.379 --> 07:40.240
Kill me.
Somebody please kill me.

07:40.241 --> 07:41.896
- I'll get it.

07:44.379 --> 07:46.551
Game Shakers.
Triple G speaking.

07:48.448 --> 07:50.067
Sure.
Kenzie, it's your mom.

07:50.068 --> 07:51.205
- Ulch.
- Don't worry,

07:51.206 --> 07:52.517
I'll tell her I can't talk.

07:55.206 --> 07:56.930
Hey Mom.

07:56.931 --> 08:00.137
Oh, it's not my mom,
it's my dad.

08:01.413 --> 08:02.999
- Well he sounded like a lady.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.896
- I know, he gets teased
about it all the time.

08:06.793 --> 08:08.171
- Will you please tell him

08:08.172 --> 08:09.516
you can't talk on the phone?

08:09.517 --> 08:11.619
- What? Wobbles?

08:11.620 --> 08:13.757
D'oh, noooo.
- Kenzie...

08:13.758 --> 08:16.724
- Wait, my dog's prosthetic leg
fell off again.

08:18.068 --> 08:19.964
- Dad listen...
just give Wobbles a treat,

08:19.965 --> 08:21.378
then take his prosthetic leg,

08:21.379 --> 08:22.688
and jam it back
onto his leg nub.

08:22.689 --> 08:24.792
Got it?
- Okay, bye Dad.

08:24.793 --> 08:26.654
- Sorry about that,

08:26.655 --> 08:28.102
what were we talking about?

08:28.103 --> 08:30.447
- Ah, who remembers?

08:30.448 --> 08:31.826
- Hey, I got a cool idea
for a game.

08:31.827 --> 08:33.688
- Oh no.
- This should be good.

08:33.689 --> 08:36.205
- Okay, there's a ton
of apps out there

08:36.206 --> 08:39.378
that tell you what the weather
is gonna be, right?

08:39.379 --> 08:40.895
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

08:40.896 --> 08:42.688
- Well, what if we create an app

08:42.689 --> 08:45.827
that tells you what
the weather was yesterday.

08:47.655 --> 08:50.481
- Hudson?
- That's me.

08:50.482 --> 08:53.826
- First... not a game.

08:53.827 --> 08:56.999
And second... who'd wanna know

08:57.000 --> 08:59.688
what the weather
was in the past?

08:59.689 --> 09:02.274
- Time-traveling weathermen?

09:02.275 --> 09:05.757
- Okay, just how far did you
shove this trimmer up your nose?

09:05.758 --> 09:08.964
- Yeah, did you hit brain?

09:08.965 --> 09:10.757
- Guys, we don't have time
to pick on Hudson,

09:10.758 --> 09:13.412
so let's just focus our...

09:13.413 --> 09:14.930
Heyyy...

09:14.931 --> 09:16.412
- What hey, you got an idea?

09:16.413 --> 09:17.413
What, c'mon, whatcha got?
Talk.

09:17.414 --> 09:18.688
- Well, when Trip mentioned

09:18.689 --> 09:19.792
the nose hair trimmer,

09:19.793 --> 09:21.067
it made me think of my dad,

09:21.068 --> 09:22.412
because last week
he went to a clinic

09:22.413 --> 09:24.172
to have his body hair removed.

09:25.413 --> 09:28.550
- Why?
- My mom likes him smooth.

09:28.551 --> 09:31.240
- And what does your
hairless lady-father

09:31.241 --> 09:33.412
have to do with a game?

09:33.413 --> 09:35.343
- Well, what if
we created a game

09:35.344 --> 09:36.930
about Laser Hair Removal?

09:36.931 --> 09:38.412
And we could give it
a snazzy title,

09:38.413 --> 09:42.309
like "Smooth Daddy"...

09:42.310 --> 09:45.378
Ooo!
Or "Hairless And Happy."

09:45.379 --> 09:47.309
- Wow.

09:47.310 --> 09:48.895
You just came up
with a game idea

09:48.896 --> 09:52.516
that's actually worse
than Yester-Weather.

09:52.517 --> 09:55.067
- Does that mean I win?
- No!

09:55.068 --> 09:57.240
You've lost!
We've all lost!

09:57.241 --> 09:59.930
- Come on, we still
have 10 more minutes

09:59.931 --> 10:02.930
'til we start our
video call, aaaand...

10:02.931 --> 10:05.274
I think I have a hot game pitch.

10:05.275 --> 10:06.930
- You do?
- Ooo, tell us!

10:06.931 --> 10:08.930
- 'Kay, you remember
what we were talkin' about

10:08.931 --> 10:10.309
the other day, on the subway?

10:10.310 --> 10:11.481
- Your back zit?

10:11.482 --> 10:13.481
- Noooo! Not my back zit!

10:13.482 --> 10:14.826
- Is it still there?

10:14.827 --> 10:15.930
- Hey, Hudson stop
looking for the...

10:15.931 --> 10:17.412
- Yep, here it is.
- Hey!

10:17.413 --> 10:20.274
Will you leave my
back zit alone?!?

10:20.275 --> 10:22.585
- So? Your game idea?

10:22.586 --> 10:24.343
- Oh yeah.

10:24.344 --> 10:26.516
Bear Fights.

10:26.517 --> 10:27.826
- Ooo right!

10:27.827 --> 10:30.412
- Whaddaya mean, "Bear Fights?"

10:30.413 --> 10:32.378
- He's talkin' about BEARS.

10:32.379 --> 10:33.654
- I'm talkin' BEARS.

10:33.655 --> 10:36.309
- Who FIGHT.
- They FIGHT.

10:36.310 --> 10:37.516
- And that's it?

10:37.517 --> 10:39.826
- Oh yeah.
- Boom!

10:39.827 --> 10:41.826
- Okaaaay, let's vote
on that idea.

10:41.827 --> 10:43.205
Hate it.
- Hate it.

10:43.206 --> 10:44.619
- Next?

10:44.620 --> 10:46.792
- I knew it.

10:46.793 --> 10:49.792
I knew that dirty, scummy
poppa-rottso was gonna do it.

10:49.793 --> 10:53.378
- Dad, this is not a good time.

10:53.379 --> 10:55.102
- What happened?

10:55.103 --> 10:58.033
- Oh I'll tell you
what happened.

10:58.034 --> 10:59.550
You know that picture of me,
swimmin' in my pool?

10:59.551 --> 11:01.206
It's all over the internet!

11:03.413 --> 11:05.171
- Whoaaa!
- Oh man!

11:05.172 --> 11:09.619
- It's good you were wearing
that blue dot over your butt.

11:09.620 --> 11:11.136
- Aw Hudson.
- You're confused!

11:11.137 --> 11:14.378
- I wasn't wearin'
a blue dot on my butt!

11:14.379 --> 11:17.724
- That blue dot was added
to make the photo safe for work!

11:18.896 --> 11:20.654
- See...
here's the uncensored photo.

11:20.655 --> 11:22.310
- Nooo!!!
- Get that outta here!

11:23.965 --> 11:25.688
- Are y'all gonna
help me out or not?

11:25.689 --> 11:27.033
- Help you what?

11:27.034 --> 11:28.964
- Make it so no one
sees that photo!

11:28.965 --> 11:30.585
- Dude, that's impossible.

11:30.586 --> 11:32.688
- It's already
all over the internet.

11:32.689 --> 11:34.550
- All right!

11:34.551 --> 11:37.343
Then how do I
shut down the internet?

11:37.344 --> 11:38.999
- Oh please.
- Are you crazy?

11:39.000 --> 11:40.861
- Dub, you can't shut down
the whole internet.

11:40.862 --> 11:44.447
- Yes I can.
I'm a superstar!

11:44.448 --> 11:46.654
- Hey Dub, do you happen to know

11:46.655 --> 11:50.205
if it might rain yesterday?
- What?!?

11:50.206 --> 11:53.619
- Nobody wants a weather app
about the past!

11:53.620 --> 11:55.412
- Seven minutes
'til the meeting.

11:55.413 --> 11:56.654
- Dub, seven minutes from now,

11:56.655 --> 11:58.861
Game Shakers has
a major video call

11:58.862 --> 12:00.964
with a huge tech company...
- Ahhhh!

12:00.965 --> 12:02.792
Those terrible internet people

12:02.793 --> 12:05.688
dun' turned me into a may-may!

12:05.689 --> 12:07.792
- A may-may?
- What's a may-may?

12:07.793 --> 12:08.999
- A "may-may" is when
the internet

12:09.000 --> 12:11.033
takes your photo of you

12:11.034 --> 12:13.103
and turns it into
a buncha stupid jokes.

12:15.310 --> 12:18.585
- Dude, you're talkin'
about a meme.

12:18.586 --> 12:20.723
- Noooo.
I'm talkin' about a May-May.

12:20.724 --> 12:22.826
It's spelled M-E-M-E.

12:22.827 --> 12:25.378
- Guys, I think
that's pronounced "Me Me".

12:25.379 --> 12:27.688
- Okay, it's meme!

12:27.689 --> 12:28.826
- Six minutes.

12:28.827 --> 12:29.895
- Double G, you have to leave

12:29.896 --> 12:31.550
so we can work.

12:31.551 --> 12:32.895
- No! I'll leave
after you tell me

12:32.896 --> 12:35.654
how I shut off the internet?

12:35.655 --> 12:38.136
- You can't shut off
the internet!

12:38.137 --> 12:40.550
- Okay, you wanna know
how to shut down the internet?

12:40.551 --> 12:42.378
- Please!
- It's impossible

12:42.379 --> 12:43.550
- No it's not.

12:43.551 --> 12:44.654
There's a huge cable

12:44.655 --> 12:46.171
that runs along the ocean floor,

12:46.172 --> 12:47.585
all the way from New York
to London.

12:47.586 --> 12:48.895
- Uh-huh.

12:48.896 --> 12:50.999
And what does this cable do?

12:51.000 --> 12:53.412
- It's the primary internet
cable that transmits

12:53.413 --> 12:55.447
all web data across the world.

12:55.448 --> 12:56.930
- You all get that?

12:56.931 --> 12:58.723
- Uh-huh.
- Writin' it down.

12:58.724 --> 12:59.964
- Where do I find this cable?

12:59.965 --> 13:01.757
- Not far from here.

13:01.758 --> 13:03.723
It's located off the coast
of Coney Island,

13:03.724 --> 13:05.550
three nautical miles
to the east.

13:05.551 --> 13:07.102
- Bunny, Ruthless!

13:07.103 --> 13:08.861
Call Port Authority and tell 'em

13:08.862 --> 13:10.723
I'm takin' my submarine
out for a little ride.

13:10.724 --> 13:13.274
- Wait...
you own a submarine?!?

13:13.275 --> 13:14.792
- Uh-huh.

13:14.793 --> 13:17.102
- Dub bought it from one of
those Eastern European countries

13:17.103 --> 13:18.930
that went outta business.

13:18.931 --> 13:20.654
- C'mon let's go!

13:20.655 --> 13:22.895
- To the Dub Sub!
- Shotgun!

13:22.896 --> 13:24.551
- Argh!
- Yeah! Bring the shotgun!

13:27.344 --> 13:28.481
- Relaaax...

13:28.482 --> 13:29.792
there's no way that one guy

13:29.793 --> 13:33.102
could actually shut down
the internet.

13:33.103 --> 13:34.654
- Hey, how much time
'til our meeting?

13:34.655 --> 13:36.999
- Four minutes.
- Aw man!

13:37.000 --> 13:38.964
- Wait... I think Dub
just gave me an idea.

13:38.965 --> 13:41.309
Come on! Come on!
Come on!

13:41.310 --> 13:43.792
Okay... What's the funniest
human body part?

13:43.793 --> 13:45.757
- Shoes!

13:45.758 --> 13:46.861
- No.

13:46.862 --> 13:50.964
- The butt!
- Yes! The butt.

13:50.965 --> 13:52.412
Uh, now imagine,
dozens of butts,

13:52.413 --> 13:54.378
with little legs,
runnin' all around,

13:54.379 --> 13:56.447
on some mission.

13:56.448 --> 13:58.274
- That's disturbing.

13:58.275 --> 14:00.757
- I'm disturbed.

14:00.758 --> 14:02.278
- Okay fine, fine,
then we got nothing.

14:03.482 --> 14:05.516
Uh... What was that?

14:05.517 --> 14:07.964
- Uhhh...

14:07.965 --> 14:09.826
Ooo, it's an email
from Full Kilt.

14:09.827 --> 14:11.757
- What?! Oh God, are they trying
to start the meeting early?

14:11.758 --> 14:13.413
- Uhhh...
- Read it!!!

14:15.655 --> 14:16.792
- It says...

14:16.793 --> 14:18.205
"Game Shakers would it be okay

14:18.206 --> 14:20.481
if we delayed the meeting
for five minutes?"

14:20.482 --> 14:22.516
- Yes!
- Awww, yeah!

14:22.517 --> 14:24.309
- So, I should reply "yes"?

14:24.310 --> 14:26.413
- Yeah!!!

14:28.379 --> 14:30.895
- 'Kay.
"That... would be fine."

14:30.896 --> 14:33.688
And I'll add a smiley face...
and a rocket...

14:33.689 --> 14:36.309
and a panda bear...
and a pink a...

14:36.310 --> 14:38.137
- Send it!

14:40.517 --> 14:42.447
All right, we just got
five extra minutes.

14:42.448 --> 14:43.688
Who needs to pee?

14:43.689 --> 14:44.792
- Pee!
- Pee!

14:44.793 --> 14:45.999
- Okay, take a bathroom break,

14:46.000 --> 14:47.619
or get some snacks,
and hurry back.

14:47.620 --> 14:49.723
- Got it.
- Deal!

14:49.724 --> 14:51.412
- Wait!
Just to confirm...

14:51.413 --> 14:53.930
you girls are gonna meet
Hudson and me back here?

14:53.931 --> 14:56.033
- Yes!
- We'll be right back...

14:56.034 --> 14:57.931
after this short break.

15:06.551 --> 15:08.481
- We're back!
- Hurry up!

15:08.482 --> 15:09.862
- We have returned!

15:11.931 --> 15:13.447
- Okay guys, this is it.

15:13.448 --> 15:15.136
We gotta pitch
this company in Scotland

15:15.137 --> 15:17.067
an amazing game in five minutes,

15:17.068 --> 15:20.930
so somebody say somethin' good.

15:20.931 --> 15:23.723
- Hey! What about a game
called "Ann Somnia?"

15:23.724 --> 15:24.724
- What's the game?

15:24.725 --> 15:25.861
- You try to make this girl

15:25.862 --> 15:27.619
named Ann go to sleep.

15:27.620 --> 15:29.792
Like, you tap to give her
a glass of warm milk,

15:29.793 --> 15:30.826
or to sing her a lullaby, or...

15:30.827 --> 15:32.102
- Hey Kenzie...

15:32.103 --> 15:33.826
y'know what we could
call that game?

15:33.827 --> 15:36.550
- What?
- Ann Awfull Game.

15:36.551 --> 15:38.171
- Fine.

15:38.172 --> 15:40.000
I'm just gonna eat my cupcake

15:41.310 --> 15:42.861
- Okay look guys,
I hate to say this, but I think

15:42.862 --> 15:44.792
the best idea we have
is the one I pitched

15:44.793 --> 15:46.171
about the butts that run around.

15:46.172 --> 15:48.619
- Well, we already
voted no on that idea.

15:48.620 --> 15:51.205
- And I didn't know we were
allowed to re-pitch our ideas.

15:51.206 --> 15:52.964
So, I vote for
Laser Hair Removal.

15:52.965 --> 15:55.826
- Well, I think we should
go with Bear Fights.

15:55.827 --> 15:57.136
- No Bear Fights.

15:57.137 --> 15:58.757
And just because your dad
went to a clinic

15:58.758 --> 16:00.205
to have his back hair removed

16:00.206 --> 16:01.619
doesn't mean it's gonna
make a good game.

16:01.620 --> 16:02.895
- It is relevant.

16:05.931 --> 16:09.309
- Guys, come on, come on,

16:09.310 --> 16:11.103
COME ON!

16:12.586 --> 16:15.067
I realize we're under
a lot of pressure right now,

16:15.068 --> 16:17.412
but we're also friends.

16:17.413 --> 16:19.241
So let's show each other
a little respect.

16:25.068 --> 16:26.619
Hehehehehe...

16:26.620 --> 16:28.103
Buh-bye, cupcake!

16:35.586 --> 16:37.102
- What the...?!
- Dub. You're making it harder.

16:37.103 --> 16:38.516
- Would you stop Bunny?
My leg but... ah...

16:38.517 --> 16:40.067
my leg is in the...

16:40.068 --> 16:41.412
Ah move it to the left.

16:41.413 --> 16:43.482
- Try to work with us!
- To the left, ah!

16:44.931 --> 16:47.309
- This is Base 19
to the Dub Sub...

16:47.310 --> 16:48.792
Code G-four.

16:48.793 --> 16:50.343
- That's the Coast Guard!

16:50.344 --> 16:52.344
- Hey Bunny,
gimme that microphone!

16:57.275 --> 17:00.378
Hello, Coast Guard...
It's Double G.

17:00.379 --> 17:02.481
- Whoa, for real?

17:02.482 --> 17:06.103
'Cuz we're big fans
of your music.

17:08.206 --> 17:10.481
Hey! We all saw
that photo of you,

17:10.482 --> 17:15.137
naked in your swimming pool.
Ahahahahah!!!

17:16.000 --> 17:19.378
- That does it.
Aye!!!

17:19.379 --> 17:22.067
- Dub, you can't disconnect
the Coast Guard!

17:22.068 --> 17:23.343
They're like the police
of the sea!

17:23.344 --> 17:25.585
- Well I just did
and you saw me do it!

17:25.586 --> 17:28.274
Now hand me that thing
so I could swim out there

17:28.275 --> 17:29.481
and go to the bottom
of the ocean

17:29.482 --> 17:31.585
and cut that big
fat internet cable!

17:31.586 --> 17:33.861
Give me that!
Yeah...

17:33.862 --> 17:37.378
Dat dat dat dat dat dat dat!

17:37.379 --> 17:39.000
Ehaaaaa!

17:42.551 --> 17:44.275
- Ahhhh!!!

17:49.931 --> 17:52.205
- How much time?
- Two minutes.

17:52.206 --> 17:55.792
- So basically we're dead.
- Maybe not.

17:55.793 --> 17:57.619
I just did a search,
and it says here

17:57.620 --> 17:59.516
that the popularity
of laser hair removal

17:59.517 --> 18:01.033
is on the rise.

18:01.034 --> 18:04.999
- Well, that's great news
for hairy people!

18:05.000 --> 18:08.654
But I don't think
it'd make a fun game!

18:08.655 --> 18:10.550
- Yeah, 'cuz the only
game idea you like

18:10.551 --> 18:13.067
is a buncha people's butts
runnin' around

18:13.068 --> 18:15.309
like a buncha crazy butts.

18:15.310 --> 18:17.688
- No. You tell me one bad thing
about that idea!

18:17.689 --> 18:19.136
- I'll tell ya three things:

18:19.137 --> 18:22.241
NOT... ENOUGH... BEARS.

18:23.586 --> 18:25.792
- You guys... less than
a minute 'til the call!

18:25.793 --> 18:26.964
- Ullchh.
- Aw man.

18:26.965 --> 18:27.965
- Can I say something?

18:27.966 --> 18:30.481
- Ulllchh!
- Whyyy?

18:30.482 --> 18:32.102
- Look, Babe really
likes her idea

18:32.103 --> 18:33.585
about butts running around.

18:33.586 --> 18:36.136
And Kenzie loves her idea
about laser hair removal.

18:36.137 --> 18:38.689
And Trip is excited
by fighting bears.

18:40.034 --> 18:41.378
- Soooo?
- Aaaaaannnd?

18:41.379 --> 18:44.205
- What if we combine
those ideas,

18:44.206 --> 18:46.964
so like, you're a bear,
and you're trying to run away

18:46.965 --> 18:49.136
from a buncha running butts,

18:49.137 --> 18:53.136
who are armed with lasers
that remove hair...

18:53.137 --> 18:55.274
and you're trying to make it
back to your bear cave

18:55.275 --> 18:57.274
before you're naked.

18:57.275 --> 19:00.103
And we can call it,
Bear Butt Laser Runner.

19:03.689 --> 19:06.792
- That's... tha...

19:06.793 --> 19:09.481
that's genius.

19:09.482 --> 19:13.447
- That sounds like the most
fun, weird game ever.

19:13.448 --> 19:15.826
- I-I need to play it,
right now.

19:15.827 --> 19:17.723
- Mm-hmm.

19:17.724 --> 19:19.205
- How'd you think of that?

19:19.206 --> 19:20.861
- I dunno.

19:20.862 --> 19:21.999
Sometimes things
are inside of me,

19:22.000 --> 19:24.448
and they just fall out.

19:28.275 --> 19:29.826
- Oh!
It's Full Kilt!

19:29.827 --> 19:30.930
From Scotland!

19:30.931 --> 19:32.447
- Okay guys, this is it!

19:32.448 --> 19:34.550
Who's excited to pitch
Bear Butt Laser Runner?!

19:34.551 --> 19:37.688
- Sing it, momma!
- I contributed!

19:37.689 --> 19:39.205
- Okay...

19:39.206 --> 19:41.861
Before I click accept
on this video conference,

19:41.862 --> 19:43.516
I just wanna say...

19:43.517 --> 19:46.792
I've never felt as close
to you guys as I do right now.

19:46.793 --> 19:50.412
And whether they like
our game idea or not,

19:50.413 --> 19:52.136
I just want you guys
to know that...

19:52.137 --> 19:54.171
well, I love you, and...

19:54.172 --> 19:55.517
- Okay not now!
- Not now!

19:58.241 --> 20:01.172
- Now c'mon, hit accept!
- Okay! Here goes...

20:04.344 --> 20:06.586
- Alright Hudson,
turn, yep... mmhmm...

20:11.586 --> 20:14.067
- Hello?
- Hi!!!

20:14.068 --> 20:17.309
- Anybody there?
Knock knock.

20:17.310 --> 20:19.447
- When is it gonna connect?

20:19.448 --> 20:22.412
- I'm not sure.
I clicked accept.

20:22.413 --> 20:24.964
- Well I can't see them.
Can they see us?

20:24.965 --> 20:27.826
- I'm not sure.

20:27.827 --> 20:29.482
- Uhh...

20:32.482 --> 20:34.895
- My face is starting to hurt.

20:34.896 --> 20:37.379
- I'll go check the connection.

20:43.137 --> 20:45.240
- Wow, this is weird...

20:45.241 --> 20:47.895
- What's weird?

20:47.896 --> 20:49.895
- I think our internet's down.

20:49.896 --> 20:51.930
- That's...
- Lemme see.

20:51.931 --> 20:53.619
Yep. I got nothin'.

20:53.620 --> 20:56.240
- This is really strange.
See, our router's working,

20:56.241 --> 20:57.619
but I'm not getting
any signal from the...

20:57.620 --> 21:00.033
- Hey... hey!
Sorry to bug you guys

21:00.034 --> 21:01.550
I work across the street
at the bagel shop.

21:01.551 --> 21:03.412
- Aw, what's up?
- Our internet's down

21:03.413 --> 21:05.550
can we use yours?
- Sorry, ours is down, too.

21:05.551 --> 21:07.205
- Dino! Dino!
- Hey, it's no good

21:07.206 --> 21:08.550
their internet's down too.

21:08.551 --> 21:09.999
- Yeah, it must be
the whole neighborhood.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.585
- No! We just heard
on the radio!

21:11.586 --> 21:13.309
The internet is down
all over the world.

21:13.310 --> 21:15.862
- What?!?
- Ahhhhhh!!!!

21:19.827 --> 21:23.067
- How could the internet
be down all over the world?

21:23.068 --> 21:24.723
- That's impossible.

21:24.724 --> 21:27.516
- Unless...

21:27.517 --> 21:29.481
you guys don't think
Double G could've...

21:45.344 --> 21:47.067
- I did it!!!

21:47.068 --> 21:49.136
I killed the internet!

21:49.137 --> 21:52.724
Ahahahahahha!

21:58.034 --> 22:00.447
Mmm.
