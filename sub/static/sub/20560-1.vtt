This is totally fascinating.

06:00.109 --> 06:03.279
The last woman in England
to be imprisoned for witchcraft

06:03.362 --> 06:05.239
was during World War II,

06:05.323 --> 06:08.576
because she somehow knew about a boat
that had been sunk.

06:08.659 --> 06:10.787
She described it as if she'd been on it.

06:10.870 --> 06:12.872
I never really pictured you
as one those people

06:12.955 --> 06:15.249
that believes in all this psychic stuff.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.418
Oh, my mom's always been into it.

06:17.502 --> 06:20.338

What an unpleasant surprise.

06:32.934 --> 06:35.686
-Amanita Caplan.
-Shall I fill in my answers now?

06:35.770 --> 06:41.317
I don't know. I'm not sure.
I don't recall. And Australia.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.902
The problem is...

06:45.071 --> 06:46.364
I don't believe you.

06:46.447 --> 06:48.658
Well, I believe the rich
should pay more taxes,

06:48.741 --> 06:51.285
which means believing in something
doesn't make it so.

06:51.369 --> 06:54.497
Let's cut the bullshit. I know you've been
in contact with Ms. Marks.

06:54.580 --> 06:57.416
-You know it because I told you I was.
-Recently.

07:00.294 --> 07:03.172
Nomi said you would still be illegally
reading our texts.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.466
It's not illegal if you're a wanted felon.

07:05.550 --> 07:08.719
But I am not a wanted felon
and since you don't have her phone number,

07:08.803 --> 07:11.347
that must mean you've been illegally
reading my texts.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.641
It is a crime to assist a felon.

07:13.724 --> 07:17.353
How would you know I was assisting unless
you yourself were committing a felony?

07:17.437 --> 07:19.313
I didn't come here to play games.

07:19.397 --> 07:21.774
I came to promise you this:

07:21.858 --> 07:26.112
if I don't put Ms. Marks behind bars,
I will put you there.

07:31.159 --> 07:34.203

08:02.106 --> 08:04.317
I thought you said no context
of where we were.

08:04.400 --> 08:07.278
That's just on the cell.
I bounce that signal from Australia.

10:05.855 --> 10:08.399

10:08.482 --> 10:10.568
I think I just fucked it all up.

10:14.447 --> 10:17.366
I know you'd say that's what I always do.

10:20.453 --> 10:21.704
Maybe it's true.

10:24.248 --> 10:26.459
Maybe I do fuck everything up.

10:28.210 --> 10:29.670
But this time...

10:32.298 --> 10:35.509

I've ever really wanted.

-[Capheus] Hmm?

11:11.045 --> 11:15.383

one of those real good artists like Mozee

11:15.466 --> 11:16.634
to paint Jean-Claude this time?

11:16.717 --> 11:18.594

Jean-Claude doesn't look
the same as he did.

11:42.618 --> 11:43.869
Neither does Obama.

11:44.495 --> 11:47.915
Hmm. I'll bet the Go-bama used Hope Obama
and not Now Obama.

11:47.998 --> 11:51.085
Yeah, yeah. No one wants a wrinkly
gray-haired dude on their bus.

11:51.168 --> 11:52.336
-Exactly.
-[chuckles]

True that. True that.

11:58.426 --> 11:59.552
To be legends...

12:01.011 --> 12:07.101

-You're looking good. Very good.
-Yes! Thank you.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.876
Art is material.

12:43.012 --> 12:46.682
Never more so than when insisting
it is not.

12:47.683 --> 12:49.351
Art is dialectic.

12:49.435 --> 12:54.482
It is enriched when shared
and impoverished

12:54.565 --> 12:58.194
by ownership and commodification.

12:58.277 --> 13:02.114
It is a language of seeing
and being seen.

to the other foot.

14:03.217 --> 14:07.888
And what was seen... now reveals the seer.

14:08.597 --> 14:11.475
Because the eyes of the beholder
find not just beauty where they want,

14:11.559 --> 14:17.106
but also shallowness, ugliness,
confusion... prejudice.

14:17.189 --> 14:19.692
Which is to say the beholder
will always see what they want to see,

14:19.775 --> 14:23.195

want to see

14:23.279 --> 14:25.656

of seeing beyond societal conventions,

14:37.334 --> 14:39.336
beyond their defining biases,

14:39.420 --> 14:41.922
such a beholder might see an image of...

stealing billions of taxpayer dollars.

21:57.107 --> 21:59.568
Instead they come after us. [scoffs]

21:59.651 --> 22:00.694
Welcome to America.

22:00.777 --> 22:01.903
How is she?

22:02.487 --> 22:03.989
Handling it better than most.

22:04.072 --> 22:06.658
I'd go crazy trapped
in that little room all day.

22:06.742 --> 22:08.327
You and me both.

22:10.495 --> 22:11.955
You know I heard that.

22:12.039 --> 22:14.666
Oh, shit. I thought I turned it off.

22:14.750 --> 22:17.878
You should leave it on. It'll give you
a sense of what I'm going through.

22:17.961 --> 22:20.630
I could handle you,
but all those other voices?

22:21.423 --> 22:23.258
I'd have lobotomized myself by now.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.886
I'm kind of getting the hang of it.

22:25.969 --> 22:28.263
Lito can be a bit of a handful sometimes.

22:29.181 --> 22:30.140
Drama queen?

22:30.223 --> 22:31.683
Definitely.

22:32.684 --> 22:33.977
You know I heard that.

22:34.061 --> 22:35.562
Oh, shit.

22:35.645 --> 22:37.647
-Oh, no. Is it Lito?
-Yeah.

22:37.731 --> 22:40.025
Uh-oh. See you in a sec.

22:42.611 --> 22:43.653
Hey.

22:45.614 --> 22:48.658
Why is it when I feel scared,
I end up with you?

22:48.742 --> 22:50.285
I don't know.

22:50.368 --> 22:53.330
I'm such a chicken compared
to most of the others.

22:54.706 --> 22:56.833
I'm worried for you.

22:57.626 --> 22:59.544
I hope that what I said to you
at the museum

22:59.628 --> 23:02.130
didn't make you do something
you didn't want to do.

23:02.881 --> 23:04.049
No.

23:05.133 --> 23:06.176
No.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.804
What you said was important to me.

23:09.971 --> 23:11.598
I needed you to say it.

23:14.184 --> 23:17.312
But it doesn't make
what is going to happen any easier.

23:18.063 --> 23:19.981
If you need anything...

23:21.942 --> 23:22.818
Thank you.

23:27.155 --> 23:30.117
I know I can be a bit... dramatic.

23:31.785 --> 23:35.872
But really, when you came out, did you
have to deal with anything like this?

23:41.086 --> 23:43.839
[photographers clamoring]

23:46.341 --> 23:47.384
No.

23:55.308 --> 23:57.811
[Rajan] I... I know something's wrong.

23:59.729 --> 24:03.108
[Kala] I feel... trapped here.

24:03.191 --> 24:05.735
Is it the villa, or is it Positano?

24:06.528 --> 24:07.904
We can go somewhere else.

24:10.073 --> 24:11.491
It's not a place.

24:13.535 --> 24:14.911
It's a feeling.

24:15.954 --> 24:20.709
Are you, uh... feeling trapped by me?

24:20.792 --> 24:24.045
-By this marriage?
-No, I... No.

24:24.588 --> 24:25.505
Um...

24:25.589 --> 24:27.132
What's trapping you?

24:27.799 --> 24:30.886
If I were to try and explain it to you,

24:30.969 --> 24:33.430
you would think I'm actually
crazier than I sound.

24:35.891 --> 24:36.933
Try me.

24:40.979 --> 24:41.980
Okay.

24:45.025 --> 24:46.401
Okay, fine.

24:50.071 --> 24:53.033
For starters, there are people,

24:53.116 --> 24:57.412
people that I feel connected to
all over the world that are innocent

24:57.495 --> 24:59.414
and yet they're locked up in prison.

25:00.498 --> 25:03.293
And they are trapped by circumstance...

25:04.211 --> 25:06.963
or by things that have happened
in the past.

25:09.257 --> 25:12.719
And then there are people
without the privilege that we have

25:12.802 --> 25:15.722
and they feel threatened
because they love a person

25:15.805 --> 25:18.016
who the world has decided
that they shouldn't love.

25:18.099 --> 25:20.143
-[clamoring continues]
-It's wrong.

25:21.061 --> 25:22.145
Terrible.

25:23.230 --> 25:26.358
Kala, Kala...
I think I know what's going on.

25:26.441 --> 25:27.359
You do?

25:27.442 --> 25:30.028
I, uh... talked to your mother.

25:30.111 --> 25:32.656
You did not tell her
that we haven't had sex yet.

25:33.281 --> 25:34.241
-I did.
-[gasps]

25:35.575 --> 25:37.202
I mean, I needed some guidance.

25:37.744 --> 25:40.580
You asked my mother if I was a...

25:41.915 --> 25:45.168
Kala, I now recognize
that this was inappropriate.

25:45.252 --> 25:48.213
-Inappropriate?
-I'm supposed to pretend I'm not up...

25:48.296 --> 25:50.173
-...set?!
-Am I supposed to pretend this is okay?

25:50.257 --> 25:53.176
Hey. Hey, calm down. Okay?

25:53.260 --> 25:54.678
-I hate...
-...that word.

25:57.097 --> 25:58.431
-I hate that...
-...word.

26:00.976 --> 26:03.853
They're trying to provoke us.
They want us to be upset by it.

26:03.937 --> 26:05.272
Of course I'm upset!

26:05.355 --> 26:07.607
But if you don't mind,
maybe you can explain one thing to me.

26:07.732 --> 26:08.900
Why is it even news?

26:08.984 --> 26:11.236
Who gives a fuck who I fuck?

26:11.319 --> 26:13.571
This is the 21st century, people.

26:14.155 --> 26:15.532
[both] Get over it!

26:15.615 --> 26:16.992
[overlapping shouts]

26:17.993 --> 26:20.370
This is insane. You can't go out there.

26:20.453 --> 26:22.205
Fuck these pirañas!

26:23.665 --> 26:25.041
Come to my house.

26:26.584 --> 26:27.919
You took me in.

26:28.837 --> 26:30.088
Let me help you.

26:34.009 --> 26:38.596
Rajan, we may be married,
but my body is mine.

26:38.680 --> 26:41.266
It is not a field of land
to be purchased and plowed.

26:41.349 --> 26:43.601
It is not for you or my mother
to gossip about.

26:43.685 --> 26:46.229
Kala! God, woman,
you're a force of nature.

26:47.022 --> 26:48.064
[breathing heavily]

26:48.148 --> 26:52.360
I've been an ass. Please, just forgive me.

26:56.906 --> 26:58.533
I was insecure.

26:59.617 --> 27:01.578
I know there were a lot of issues.

27:01.661 --> 27:03.747
The travel and other things.

27:04.748 --> 27:08.168
But I began to wonder that,
if now that the wedding was over...

27:09.419 --> 27:11.588
-you were still having second thoughts.
-No.

27:11.671 --> 27:13.506
I told you they were done.

27:14.758 --> 27:16.217
And they are.

27:39.866 --> 27:42.660
The more bullets I find,
the more impossible it looks.

27:43.745 --> 27:44.954
We were very lucky.

27:45.038 --> 27:47.791
Come on, I know luck. And this?

27:49.000 --> 27:49.834
It's not luck.

27:53.213 --> 27:56.591
I get that some things are difficult
for people to talk about,

27:56.674 --> 28:01.179
but when I think about the fact that
we haven't talked about that day,

28:01.262 --> 28:04.140
-it gets me a little upset.
-Why?

28:04.974 --> 28:06.935
You're a damn good driver.

28:07.018 --> 28:08.311
You are a loyal son.

28:09.396 --> 28:13.817
You're even half a decent mechanic,
if I'm here to instruct you. However...

28:13.900 --> 28:16.027
I've known you since you were
ten years old.

28:16.820 --> 28:20.448
And one thing you're not, Mr. Van Damn,
is a genius of martial arts.

28:21.658 --> 28:23.451
It's me. Jela.

28:24.994 --> 28:27.580
Come on, what happened that day
with the Superpower?

28:33.002 --> 28:36.214
[sighs] Look, I know it's going
to sound crazy, but...

28:39.718 --> 28:40.927
a spirit.

28:41.010 --> 28:43.179
You sure you want to tell him?

28:45.181 --> 28:46.725
-Maybe it's time.
-What's time?

28:48.893 --> 28:50.145
The spirit.

28:51.187 --> 28:53.398
She's here. Good to see you.

28:55.150 --> 28:57.152
Where is this spirit from?

28:57.235 --> 28:59.112
-She lives in Seoul.
-Korea?

29:00.780 --> 29:02.073
She's a businesswoman.

29:03.783 --> 29:05.243
My age exactly.

29:05.702 --> 29:08.413
Born the same moment I was.

29:08.496 --> 29:12.083
The first breath I took,
she took too, but in Korea.

29:12.709 --> 29:14.419
What a thing, yeah?

29:15.879 --> 29:17.046
She's here now?

29:18.465 --> 29:19.841
Sort of.

29:19.924 --> 29:22.677
-Actually, she's in prison.
-Prison.

29:23.595 --> 29:25.096
Why is she in prison?

29:26.890 --> 29:28.057
It's complicated.

29:28.933 --> 29:33.146
The sad part is that while she was there,
her father was murdered.

29:34.314 --> 29:36.441
Does she know that your father
was murdered?

29:37.650 --> 29:39.319
We have many things in common.

29:40.320 --> 29:41.905
Why did the spirit pick you?

29:46.868 --> 29:48.787
That is a mystery I can't explain.

29:53.041 --> 29:54.793
But I will always be grateful for.

29:57.170 --> 29:58.171
Me, too.

30:03.176 --> 30:06.596
I know we live in our little bubble world
in this city, but, I mean,

30:06.679 --> 30:12.185
when I look at those pictures of Lito
and Hernando, I think, "That's hot."

30:12.268 --> 30:14.854
Mmm! So hot.

30:14.938 --> 30:16.105
I just don't get it.

30:16.189 --> 30:18.441
Why can't the rest of the world
see what we see?

30:19.400 --> 30:20.527
I don't know.

30:25.615 --> 30:29.410
-[inaudible chatter]
-[laughing]

30:30.078 --> 30:32.080
But they're in a safe place now.

30:34.541 --> 30:36.709
-Mmm!
-[giggling]

30:41.589 --> 30:43.049
Salud!

31:06.489 --> 31:07.782
You're nervous.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.910
Someone's been following me.

31:14.706 --> 31:15.582
Police?

31:16.916 --> 31:19.836
Cops made it clear they didn't give a shit
about the shooting.

31:21.212 --> 31:22.213
Sounds like cops.

31:23.882 --> 31:24.841
If you need help...

31:25.425 --> 31:26.259
I'm fine.

31:28.219 --> 31:30.305
If you need some air...

31:31.097 --> 31:32.348
I'm good.

31:56.706 --> 31:58.249
It's not what you think.

31:59.167 --> 32:00.585
Jonas.

32:00.668 --> 32:02.670
[watch beeping]

32:08.718 --> 32:10.345
-Daddy?
-Hmm?

32:10.428 --> 32:12.180
Can we go see the swans?

32:12.889 --> 32:14.182
Of course.

32:15.808 --> 32:17.352
Did you know swans mate for life?

32:21.773 --> 32:22.857
That's his daughter.

32:23.900 --> 32:26.653
Fancies himself quite the family man.

32:26.736 --> 32:28.905
Loves pretending to be one of them.

32:30.740 --> 32:34.243
You're not the first one to try to hide
in the corner of his mind,

32:34.327 --> 32:36.204
waiting for him to make a mistake.

32:38.039 --> 32:39.540
The heroin helps, doesn't it?

32:40.667 --> 32:42.377
The connection feels vague.

32:43.086 --> 32:47.840
He's usually meticulous with his pills,
which means he's made a mistake or...

32:49.092 --> 32:50.551
he wants us to see this.

32:51.260 --> 32:54.722
Stratford? Maybe Cambridge.

32:56.057 --> 32:57.183
What are the pills?

32:57.266 --> 32:59.227
We call them blockers.

33:00.019 --> 33:01.938
Cuts you off from the psycellium.

33:02.021 --> 33:04.732
Temporarily turns us into them.

33:05.316 --> 33:10.571
Keeps hunters like him protected...
and prisoners like me isolated.

33:10.655 --> 33:13.116
-[low humming]
-You hear that?

33:15.535 --> 33:17.704
It's the blocker dissolving
the connection.

33:28.715 --> 33:29.757
Where are you?

33:30.508 --> 33:34.095
BPO has pits all over the world
to throw us into.

33:38.266 --> 33:41.519
We know BPO is receiving funding
from governments all over the world,

33:41.602 --> 33:43.813
but we have very little
on who they actually are.

33:43.896 --> 33:45.273
Of course not.

33:45.356 --> 33:49.819
This is an organization responsible
for hunting and controlling what they see

33:49.902 --> 33:52.447
as a very dangerous species.

33:53.322 --> 33:56.743
They're afraid of us. So you and your
cluster must be very careful.

33:57.994 --> 33:59.996
How many hunters are there like Whispers?

34:00.079 --> 34:01.372
[low chuckle]

34:02.123 --> 34:04.000
No one is like him.

34:05.418 --> 34:08.629
But there are others, collaborators,

34:08.713 --> 34:11.424
networks of recruiters working for BPO.

34:14.969 --> 34:18.306
I keep having visions... of Angelica.

34:18.389 --> 34:22.310
I keep seeing her in a... in a cabin.

34:23.061 --> 34:24.228
[gasps]

34:25.730 --> 34:27.023
The cabin.

34:28.775 --> 34:30.985
First place I ever considered a home.

34:37.784 --> 34:41.162
But I've never been there.
How can I see that?

34:41.245 --> 34:44.582
A genetic birth transfers genes.

34:44.665 --> 34:49.378
A sensate birth transfers
sense experience and memory.

34:49.462 --> 34:51.005
You are Angelica's children,

34:51.089 --> 34:53.841
so parts of her consciousness
still echo in you.

34:55.051 --> 34:56.594
We weren't her first cluster?

34:58.763 --> 35:00.056
No.

35:02.058 --> 35:03.226
What happened to them?

35:03.309 --> 35:05.812
The same thing that's happened to me.

35:07.980 --> 35:10.733
And that in all probability
is going to happen to you.

35:12.693 --> 35:13.528
[gasps]

35:15.696 --> 35:17.990
Sadly, they've realized I'm visiting.

35:18.074 --> 35:22.620
Shit! Wait, wait. What about Whispers?
He must have been born into a cluster.

35:24.539 --> 35:25.456
They're all dead.

35:26.457 --> 35:29.043
In his sleep, he still talks to them.

35:29.127 --> 35:31.504
-[gasps]
-[Angelica] He's coming. Go!

35:34.507 --> 35:35.341
[soft gasp]

35:43.933 --> 35:47.937
This is incredible.
9/11, World Trade Center, planes hit.

35:48.020 --> 35:52.483
This guy was guided out of the building
by a vivid physical presence.

35:53.192 --> 35:54.152
Wow.

35:55.027 --> 35:57.738
-This guy, Kolovi--
-He's the professor in Chicago?

35:57.822 --> 36:01.492
Right. He cites Freud's theory
of pre-language communication

36:01.576 --> 36:04.829
and suggests the psychic synaptic field
would explain a lot of things.

36:04.912 --> 36:08.624
Like how inventions and scientific
breakthroughs happen at the same time

36:08.708 --> 36:10.293
all over the world.

36:10.376 --> 36:12.461
Has your mom contacted
her anthropologist friend?

36:12.545 --> 36:14.088
-She's setting up a meeting.
-Good.

36:14.172 --> 36:17.049
Because the more I read,
the more I'm starting to believe this.

36:17.133 --> 36:18.801
Me, too.

36:21.971 --> 36:23.556
[Jela] Spanner.

36:32.815 --> 36:33.900
[grunts]

36:38.196 --> 36:40.323
-You believe in miracles?
-You know I do.

36:40.406 --> 36:42.283
[laughing]

36:42.366 --> 36:44.785
Feast your eyes on the comeback
of the century!

57:37.454 --> 57:39.372
Okay. We get it.

57:39.914 --> 57:43.084
-But there will be consequences.
-Legal consequences.

57:44.169 --> 57:45.628
Career consequences.

57:47.630 --> 57:49.340
Fuck consequences.

57:52.427 --> 57:54.053
Fuck consequences.

57:56.222 --> 57:57.474
Buongiorno.

57:57.557 --> 57:59.058
Buongiorno, doctor.

57:59.642 --> 58:00.977
So, how are you doing?

58:01.519 --> 58:02.687
Much better.

58:03.271 --> 58:08.193
Well, you've dodged a bullet, eh?
[chuckles]

58:09.360 --> 58:11.696
I don't see this often, I have to say.

58:11.779 --> 58:13.406
A phantom fracture.

58:15.700 --> 58:16.659
"Phantom"?

58:16.743 --> 58:18.912
Yes. It's good news.

58:18.995 --> 58:22.707
Rupture of the superficial dorsal vein.
Not a true fracture.

58:22.790 --> 58:24.292
A sprain is all.

58:24.375 --> 58:27.837
A bit of rest and you'll be out
and able to enjoy your vacation.

58:27.921 --> 58:31.132
Honeymoon. We're here on our honeymoon.

58:31.216 --> 58:33.092
Oh. [chuckles]

58:33.176 --> 58:35.720
Well, it could have been far worse, huh?

58:35.803 --> 58:40.600
Count your blessings.
Hopefully we will have no complications.

58:40.683 --> 58:42.060
Comp-- Complications?

58:43.353 --> 58:44.729
Yes. Penile problems.

58:44.812 --> 58:46.105
Oh, my Ganesha.

58:46.189 --> 58:50.902
Painful intercourse, painful erection,
erectile dysfunction.

58:51.861 --> 58:54.197
But it's looking good.
I'm not expecting any problems.

58:54.906 --> 58:59.244
Is there anything I can do
to aid the recovery?

58:59.327 --> 59:01.829
Well, your husband needs love.

59:01.913 --> 59:06.042
You're just married. Love cures all ills.

59:07.085 --> 59:08.545
Well, most.

59:09.879 --> 59:12.549
Well, some. [chuckles]

59:13.424 --> 59:15.218
Good luck, hmm?

59:16.219 --> 59:18.680
-Thank you, doctor.
-Have a good day.

59:20.640 --> 59:24.102
You'll be fine. Don't worry,
I think everything will be fine.

59:26.437 --> 59:27.272
[moans]

59:28.189 --> 59:30.900
-Are you okay?
-[stammers] Please don't.

59:30.984 --> 59:32.735
Your love causes pain.

59:40.201 --> 59:41.536
Sugar?

59:41.619 --> 59:43.413
Why are you here, Auntie?

59:44.205 --> 59:47.417
I don't know everything
that happened in your past,

59:47.500 --> 59:50.086
but I'm aware my husband made his choices.

59:50.169 --> 59:52.422
And you made him pay for them.

59:52.505 --> 59:55.091
So are you here to forgive me
or make me pay?

59:56.551 --> 59:59.637
One day I suspect you will pay a price
for your choices,

59:59.721 --> 1:00:02.390
as my husband and his son paid for theirs.

1:00:03.182 --> 1:00:05.226
But, rest assured,

1:00:05.310 --> 1:00:07.562
the finger on the trigger
will not be mine.

1:00:13.651 --> 1:00:17.238
As you know, over 20 years,
your Uncle Sergei amassed a portfolio

1:00:17.322 --> 1:00:20.658
of business and property interests
throughout East Berlin.

1:00:21.284 --> 1:00:22.952
I've come equipped with a...

1:00:24.037 --> 1:00:26.539
a map of the city, if I may?

1:00:30.043 --> 1:00:33.087
Berlin is presently divided
into four major territories.

1:00:33.171 --> 1:00:36.799
I call them "kingdoms."
Nice dynastic ring to it, no?

1:00:37.842 --> 1:00:41.679
The kingdom of the west,
run by Volker Bohm, I've marked in blue.

1:00:41.763 --> 1:00:45.266
To the south, dominated by Khalil Dogan,
is in yellow.

1:00:45.350 --> 1:00:47.143
Sebastian Fuchs controls the north.

1:00:47.226 --> 1:00:50.146
And your late uncle's kingdom is red.

1:00:50.730 --> 1:00:56.027
As a consequence of, uh... recent events,
the east is without leadership,

1:00:56.110 --> 1:00:58.655
a situation that will not last
much longer.

1:00:59.280 --> 1:01:00.657
Am I supposed to care?

1:01:01.699 --> 1:01:05.078
By killing your uncle,
you didn't just out-Hamlet Hamlet.

1:01:05.161 --> 1:01:07.288
You might have pitched the city
into a war.

1:01:07.372 --> 1:01:10.083
But I am in negotiation with Volker
and the other kings.

1:01:10.166 --> 1:01:13.878
I believe it is not too late.
You can still stop the war from happening.

1:01:14.837 --> 1:01:15.713
How?

1:01:15.797 --> 1:01:17.548
By coming home.

1:01:17.632 --> 1:01:19.634
Your presence will calm everything.

1:01:19.717 --> 1:01:22.095
It will forestall
more unnecessary bloodshed.

1:01:22.929 --> 1:01:23.805
Why?

1:01:23.888 --> 1:01:27.850
Because to me, to him,
to anyone who understands this map...

1:01:28.476 --> 1:01:30.478
you are still a Bogdanow.

1:01:33.231 --> 1:01:34.899
[sighs]

1:01:35.483 --> 1:01:36.651
Thanks for the tea.

1:01:45.535 --> 1:01:47.787
-He found you, Will.
-[gasps]

1:01:49.122 --> 1:01:52.500
This is how Angelica
wasted the end of her life.

1:01:52.583 --> 1:01:53.960
Is that your plan?

1:01:54.043 --> 1:01:57.797
Killing yourself with a needle
in some abandoned squat in Iceland?

1:01:58.589 --> 1:01:59.882
[Will chuckles softly]

1:01:59.966 --> 1:02:03.386
Oh, no. It's not that easy.

1:02:04.303 --> 1:02:06.389
You have no idea where we are.

1:02:08.808 --> 1:02:10.393
We could be anywhere.

1:02:11.227 --> 1:02:13.521
I could care less where you are, Will.

1:02:14.439 --> 1:02:16.357
What I care about is how you are.

1:02:17.775 --> 1:02:20.111
Have you looked at yourself
in the mirror lately?

1:02:21.404 --> 1:02:24.449
You want to help me... Milton?

1:02:24.532 --> 1:02:26.409
Just tell me where you are.

1:02:27.034 --> 1:02:28.911
Well, I'm right here, Will.

1:02:39.839 --> 1:02:41.257
Same place we are.

1:02:42.091 --> 1:02:43.551
Nowhere.

1:02:45.678 --> 1:02:48.973
There are standard procedures
for bringing in a new sensate.

1:02:49.432 --> 1:02:52.101
You're a cop, Will.
You understand procedure.

1:02:52.185 --> 1:02:53.478
I do.

1:02:56.147 --> 1:02:58.107
I've been on that side of the table.

1:02:58.191 --> 1:03:01.778
I know what you wanna do.
You want to keep me talking long enough...

1:03:02.820 --> 1:03:05.615
hoping I'll reveal something
about where we might be.

1:03:08.326 --> 1:03:09.911
I could do the same...

1:03:11.329 --> 1:03:15.416
hoping you might tell us something
about your beautiful wife.

1:03:18.002 --> 1:03:19.879
I'm not wearing a ring, Will.

1:03:20.797 --> 1:03:22.131
No.

1:03:22.215 --> 1:03:25.718
But you are wearing a tan line,

1:03:25.802 --> 1:03:28.888
meaning you removed it
before you walked in here

1:03:28.971 --> 1:03:30.681
and that you had a holiday recently.

1:03:30.765 --> 1:03:34.310
And being someone who knows something
about these kind of organizations,

1:03:34.393 --> 1:03:37.063
I would bet you were asked
to take a voluntary leave

1:03:37.146 --> 1:03:39.190
after you fucked up in Iceland.

1:03:40.650 --> 1:03:42.026
Huh?

1:03:42.109 --> 1:03:44.028
You're making a choice, Will.

1:03:45.446 --> 1:03:49.116
A choice that will have consequences
that will affect not just you.

1:03:51.619 --> 1:03:56.123
The pain will be felt by everyone
you are connected to.

1:03:56.833 --> 1:03:59.710
Your partner, your friends on the force...

1:04:01.254 --> 1:04:02.672
your father.

1:04:03.297 --> 1:04:06.926
And of course... Ms. Gunnardottir.

1:04:07.760 --> 1:04:09.345
Are you ready for that?

1:04:14.851 --> 1:04:16.894
[gasps] Is it him?

1:04:18.062 --> 1:04:19.397
You need a shot?

1:04:20.273 --> 1:04:22.733
She reminds me of Angelica.

1:04:24.485 --> 1:04:29.240
Beautiful creatures that you know
are too fragile for this world.

1:04:29.866 --> 1:04:32.785
When Angelica put the gun in her mouth,
I wondered...

1:04:33.911 --> 1:04:37.164
what was the thought that finally
made her pull the trigger?

1:04:38.249 --> 1:04:40.793
If Riley comes to the same end...

1:04:41.586 --> 1:04:46.382
do you think her last thought
will be of you... or of me?

1:04:48.426 --> 1:04:51.178
Angelica couldn't bear the weight
of her choices.

1:04:52.638 --> 1:04:55.683
Do you really think you're any different?

1:05:30.635 --> 1:05:32.428
I was thinking about my mom.

1:05:34.013 --> 1:05:35.222
Remember her?

1:05:39.685 --> 1:05:44.523
There was this one night...
he was gone drinking and we were alone.

1:05:47.276 --> 1:05:48.778
She told me...

1:05:50.112 --> 1:05:52.365
that she had a secret inside of her.

1:05:54.617 --> 1:05:57.119
That I was once a secret.

1:06:01.749 --> 1:06:07.296
And that secrets are better than love,
because they kept people together.

1:06:10.299 --> 1:06:12.718
Your mother was crazy as cat shit.

1:06:16.305 --> 1:06:17.390
You're awake?

1:06:17.932 --> 1:06:21.727
If I had to hear one more of your
confessions, I was going to kill myself.

1:06:21.811 --> 1:06:22.728
Ow!

1:06:22.812 --> 1:06:24.063
-Sorry!
-[groans]

1:06:25.481 --> 1:06:27.733
Oh, fuck. I missed you so much, brother.

1:06:28.609 --> 1:06:31.404
-I need a beer.
-Okay.

1:06:31.946 --> 1:06:33.698
[both laughing]

1:06:33.781 --> 1:06:35.908
[disco music playing]

1:06:55.720 --> 1:06:58.222
[shrill whistling]

1:06:58.305 --> 1:07:00.182
[Jela speaks Swahili]

1:07:00.266 --> 1:07:03.060
[in English] Last stop! Everybody out!
Downtown Nairobi.

1:07:03.811 --> 1:07:07.690
Everybody out! Everybody out!
Faster, faster, faster, faster, faster!

1:07:07.773 --> 1:07:09.942
[chattering in Swahili]

1:07:11.235 --> 1:07:13.446
[in English]
Faster, faster, faster, faster!

1:07:15.656 --> 1:07:18.993
-Not bad, partner. Not bad. [chuckles]
-Mmm!

1:07:20.202 --> 1:07:22.621
-Hey! Hello.
-Yes?

1:07:22.705 --> 1:07:25.416
-Mwisho. End of the road.
-This is the end of our route.

1:07:25.499 --> 1:07:27.793
-We know.
-What are you doing then?

1:07:27.877 --> 1:07:30.254
-Waiting for you to go back.
-Go--

1:07:31.088 --> 1:07:32.840
-Why?
-I had told my friend

1:07:32.923 --> 1:07:34.300
I was afraid to quit my job.

1:07:34.383 --> 1:07:36.969
And then I rode your bus,
and I am no longer afraid.

1:07:38.637 --> 1:07:40.598
-Yeah? No.
-Is this a joke?

1:07:40.681 --> 1:07:42.433
-No, I swear.
-It is no joke.

1:07:42.516 --> 1:07:46.020
We heard how the spirit of Jean-Claude
guided you and protected you.

1:07:46.103 --> 1:07:48.481
And helped you kick the ass of Superpower.

1:07:48.564 --> 1:07:51.776
And now we're hoping the spirit
of Jean-Claude can help us.

1:07:55.863 --> 1:07:57.531
[both laughing]

1:08:00.284 --> 1:08:02.369
[whistles, speaks in Swahili]

1:08:02.453 --> 1:08:04.789
[indistinct chatter]

1:08:04.872 --> 1:08:07.917
...and we can take care of that.
Can you take care of that?

1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:10.628
-What? [laughing]
-[keypad beeps]

1:08:12.296 --> 1:08:13.506
[beeping]

1:08:13.589 --> 1:08:15.299
-[buzzing]
-[Hernando] Everything okay?

1:08:15.382 --> 1:08:16.759
Code's not working.

1:08:17.343 --> 1:08:18.385
Hello, Lito!

1:08:19.261 --> 1:08:22.640
Mr. Sicaro! Good morning!
My door code isn't working.

1:08:24.141 --> 1:08:25.142
We had it changed.

1:08:25.226 --> 1:08:26.811
Had it changed?

1:08:27.394 --> 1:08:28.729
We sent a letter.

1:08:28.813 --> 1:08:30.856
-Where?
-Your apartment.

1:08:31.357 --> 1:08:35.069
But how am I supposed to get a letter
if I cannot get into my apartment?

1:08:35.778 --> 1:08:38.823
I'm sorry, Lito. Have a nice day! Bye!

1:08:38.906 --> 1:08:40.658
-Mr.--
-[buzzing]

1:08:40.741 --> 1:08:42.118
What happened?

1:08:42.201 --> 1:08:44.829
-He's not answering.
-Call him again. He has to answer.

1:08:44.912 --> 1:08:46.747
I'm calling him! He's not answering!

1:08:46.831 --> 1:08:50.167
No, call him again! Call him again.
He has to answer. He works there.

1:08:50.251 --> 1:08:51.836
-Call him again, please.
-[buzzing]

1:08:51.919 --> 1:08:54.130
-He was the nice one.
-He was the nice guy. He was.

1:08:54.213 --> 1:08:56.966
[hitting buzzer continuously]

1:08:57.049 --> 1:08:59.260
-You said he was the nice one.
-He was the nice guy.

1:09:00.928 --> 1:09:03.806
-This is not right.
-Lito, wait. Lito...

1:09:03.889 --> 1:09:05.850
-What are you gonna do?
-Please.

1:09:05.933 --> 1:09:08.227
-Give me some space. Please.
-What are you gonna do?

1:09:08.310 --> 1:09:10.104
-No! Wait, Lito!
-Wait! Lito!

1:09:10.187 --> 1:09:11.897
-[groans]
-Lito! Hey!

1:09:13.357 --> 1:09:15.442
-Are you okay?
-I'm all right!

1:09:21.073 --> 1:09:22.032
Give me that.

1:09:41.093 --> 1:09:44.013
No, Lito! Lito, what are you--
What are you gonna do?

1:09:48.142 --> 1:09:48.976
[gasps]

1:09:49.602 --> 1:09:51.478
-[keypad beeps]
-[door buzzes open]

1:09:53.939 --> 1:09:55.107
[Daniela laughs]

1:09:55.191 --> 1:09:56.775
Holy shit, Lito!

1:09:56.859 --> 1:09:59.403
Where did you learn how to do that?

1:10:03.532 --> 1:10:04.617
I was a burglar.

1:10:06.994 --> 1:10:08.245
In The Devil Died at Dawn.

1:10:09.163 --> 1:10:10.456
Also an assassin.

1:10:11.790 --> 1:10:14.293
And a toreador. I remember.

1:10:15.377 --> 1:10:16.462
You were great.

1:10:19.131 --> 1:10:20.799
Oh, you're my hero!

1:10:22.760 --> 1:10:24.011
[sighs]

1:10:24.094 --> 1:10:26.055
-Good to see you.
-You, too.

1:10:34.480 --> 1:10:35.648
Rajan?

1:10:38.150 --> 1:10:39.235
Rajan?

1:10:40.486 --> 1:10:41.362
There you are.

1:10:50.162 --> 1:10:51.330
What is it?

1:10:51.747 --> 1:10:52.790
What's wrong?

1:10:53.374 --> 1:10:55.292
Did the doctor have some bad news?

1:10:56.043 --> 1:10:58.254
No, he gave me a clean bill of health.

1:10:58.337 --> 1:10:59.380
But this is good news.

1:11:04.843 --> 1:11:07.137
You know, those are the siren islands.

1:11:08.847 --> 1:11:11.725
I always thought the myth
was about Odysseus or the sailors.

1:11:13.143 --> 1:11:15.271
No one writes much about the sirens.

1:11:16.855 --> 1:11:19.858
About why they sing, what they want.

1:11:19.942 --> 1:11:21.235
Rajan...

1:11:22.319 --> 1:11:25.072
are you going to tell me
why the bags are packed?

1:11:25.906 --> 1:11:27.032
It's big, but--

1:11:28.367 --> 1:11:29.535
What's wrong, baby?

1:11:39.878 --> 1:11:41.380
Ay...

1:11:43.340 --> 1:11:47.011
They can't just do this.
They can't just take our stuff.

1:11:48.012 --> 1:11:49.513
This is Mexico.

1:11:50.264 --> 1:11:52.391
The sad truth is I've seen worse.

1:11:54.018 --> 1:11:55.978
[Hernando]
"Due to violations of Tenant Occupancy

1:11:56.061 --> 1:11:58.605
as well as proven instances
of grave moral turpitude

1:11:58.689 --> 1:12:02.484
and in accordance to the Condominium
Association's bylaws, Articles 69 and 70,

1:12:02.568 --> 1:12:06.071
the Owners' Council has unanimously
decided to cancel the lease.

1:12:07.197 --> 1:12:09.783
Eviction procedures
to be initiated immediately."

1:12:16.040 --> 1:12:18.083
-[Hernando exhales]
-[Rajan sighs]

1:12:20.044 --> 1:12:23.672
Whenever I wanted something,
I focused everything on that goal...

1:12:24.298 --> 1:12:28.385
usually refusing to hear or see anything
but what I wanted.

1:12:31.555 --> 1:12:34.183
And I've never wanted anything
like I wanted you.

1:12:35.559 --> 1:12:39.563
I've been so blind that I couldn't see
the most obvious thing:

1:12:40.689 --> 1:12:46.779
that how I felt about you was not the same
as how you felt about me.

1:12:46.862 --> 1:12:48.155
That's--

1:12:48.238 --> 1:12:50.657
But if I'm anything, I'm optimistic.

1:12:51.408 --> 1:12:54.453
Which made me realize that
it's not too late

1:12:54.536 --> 1:12:56.997
for either of us to come
to a quick decision to--

1:12:57.081 --> 1:12:59.333
Rajan, please, don't say anything more.

1:13:01.168 --> 1:13:04.421
Right now, let us not make any decisions.

1:13:05.923 --> 1:13:09.259
Whatever happens tomorrow,
we will let the fates decide.

1:13:10.386 --> 1:13:11.887
But what happens right now...

1:13:13.347 --> 1:13:15.557
what happens for the rest of this night...

1:13:17.267 --> 1:13:18.268
please...

1:13:19.978 --> 1:13:21.105
let me decide.

1:13:36.161 --> 1:13:38.956
-Teagan emailed.
-Your sister?

1:13:39.456 --> 1:13:42.501
-She's getting married.
-That's great!

1:13:42.584 --> 1:13:45.337
She wants me to be her maid of honor.

1:13:45.421 --> 1:13:48.090
Aww! That's beautiful!

1:13:48.173 --> 1:13:51.593
Except that I'm a fugitive
and even if I did try to go,

1:13:51.677 --> 1:13:54.304
my own parents would probably
be the first ones to turn me in.

1:13:55.556 --> 1:13:57.182
That's true.

1:13:57.266 --> 1:13:59.059
-[four quick knocks]
-The signal!

1:14:11.196 --> 1:14:14.241
This room is occupied by Maria
but she's at work.

1:14:19.621 --> 1:14:23.083
Tartine. But, uh... no thank you.

1:14:23.750 --> 1:14:24.585
Watch her.

1:14:26.336 --> 1:14:27.379
What's up?

1:14:33.677 --> 1:14:35.721
[whispers]
I knew it was fucking Bent-Dick.

1:14:35.804 --> 1:14:37.014
Excuse me.

1:14:48.609 --> 1:14:49.693
[drawer rattles]

1:14:52.821 --> 1:14:55.657
This is a fugitive warrant for Nomi Marks.

1:14:55.741 --> 1:14:59.036
We have solid information
that she and her girlfriend

1:14:59.119 --> 1:15:00.996
are currently residing in this shelter.

1:15:01.788 --> 1:15:03.290
I haven't seen Nomi for months.

1:15:03.373 --> 1:15:06.793
Either you tell me where they are
or I head straight downtown

1:15:06.877 --> 1:15:10.047
and I talk to every grant office,
every politician I can,

1:15:10.130 --> 1:15:12.466
to shut this place down.

1:15:16.720 --> 1:15:20.390
They are not here.

1:15:29.066 --> 1:15:30.275
[door closes]

1:15:32.945 --> 1:15:34.571
[sighs]

1:15:49.586 --> 1:15:51.547
I wanted to come back first thing...

1:15:52.714 --> 1:15:54.132
because if I didn't...

1:15:55.133 --> 1:15:57.511
I knew I would never walk through
that door again.

1:15:57.594 --> 1:15:58.887
[soft chuckle]

1:16:08.230 --> 1:16:10.023
I've been thinking a lot about that day.

1:16:11.358 --> 1:16:13.068
I said it was our revolution.

1:16:13.902 --> 1:16:16.363
I forgot in revolutions people get shot.

1:16:20.492 --> 1:16:22.119
I'm not you, Wolfie.

1:16:23.412 --> 1:16:24.496
I'm not Conan.

1:16:24.580 --> 1:16:25.747
[scoffs]

1:16:26.748 --> 1:16:28.417
I'm just a sidekick.

1:16:30.335 --> 1:16:31.753
From Wuppertal.

1:16:32.504 --> 1:16:35.007
What are you talking about? Huh?

1:16:36.758 --> 1:16:38.552
Maybe it's time to go home.

1:16:41.680 --> 1:16:43.807
Find a nice girl, settle down.

1:16:44.975 --> 1:16:46.184
Hey.

1:16:46.268 --> 1:16:48.770
You can come by. Maybe...

1:16:48.854 --> 1:16:51.982
we'll have pot roast,
ride the Schwebebahn.

1:16:52.899 --> 1:16:56.278
Not so bad a life, is it?

1:17:00.907 --> 1:17:03.076
No. Not so bad.

1:17:04.703 --> 1:17:06.038
[sighs]

1:17:08.498 --> 1:17:13.045
I just... need you to do one thing for me.

1:17:15.547 --> 1:17:18.216
-Talk me out of it!
-[both laughing]

1:17:20.552 --> 1:17:22.471
The look on your face, man.

1:17:22.554 --> 1:17:24.765
-Yeah, I got ya!
-It was a hell of a performance.

1:17:24.848 --> 1:17:26.475
Performance comes later.

1:17:26.558 --> 1:17:28.644
I have been in the hospital a long time.

1:17:28.727 --> 1:17:33.106
Horizontal, but no fun.
Tonight, horizontal and much fun.

1:17:33.732 --> 1:17:35.192
Hello.

1:17:36.735 --> 1:17:38.070
Mr. Bogdanow?

1:17:38.153 --> 1:17:39.696
What? We didn't order this.

1:17:40.989 --> 1:17:43.450
Compliments of the gentlemen
sitting over there.

1:17:47.871 --> 1:17:49.122
Who are they?

1:17:50.707 --> 1:17:51.625
Friends.

1:17:52.417 --> 1:17:54.002
We have friends now?

1:17:55.295 --> 1:17:56.588
Things have changed, huh?

1:17:58.382 --> 1:17:59.549
[Felix chuckles]

1:18:12.062 --> 1:18:12.938
[door closes]

1:18:13.689 --> 1:18:14.648
Hello.

1:18:19.861 --> 1:18:21.279
Where is my attorney?

1:18:21.363 --> 1:18:26.368
Regrettably, he has chosen this time
to retire from practice.

1:18:27.369 --> 1:18:29.413
He will be missed.

1:18:30.664 --> 1:18:35.085
My associates and I have been hired
to take on your case.

1:18:36.670 --> 1:18:39.965
-These guys aren't lawyers.
-Surveillance camera just powered down.

1:18:40.048 --> 1:18:42.592
We have reviewed all of the court reports.

1:18:42.676 --> 1:18:45.554
These guys are the worst liars
I've ever seen in my life.

1:18:45.637 --> 1:18:46.471
They're killers.

1:18:47.681 --> 1:18:48.932
Who hired you?

1:18:51.977 --> 1:18:53.770
I think you know who.

1:18:58.692 --> 1:19:03.071
He wanted you to know that
he has never been the forgiving type.

1:19:06.324 --> 1:19:09.661
You think you can kill me
inside a government institution?

1:19:09.745 --> 1:19:12.372
Everyone knows how unstable you are.

1:19:12.456 --> 1:19:13.749
"She went crazy."

1:19:13.832 --> 1:19:15.584
"Jumped over the table."

1:19:15.667 --> 1:19:19.379
"We had no choice.
We had to defend ourselves."

1:19:26.011 --> 1:19:27.053
This is bad.

1:19:27.971 --> 1:19:29.848
-Guard!
-Guard!

1:19:30.891 --> 1:19:31.892
Coffee break.

1:19:33.143 --> 1:19:37.230
Let's see how you fight with
50-thousand volts of electricity.

1:19:37.856 --> 1:19:39.357
Wait, wait, wait! Wait!

1:19:39.441 --> 1:19:41.610
Let me ask you one more question, please.

1:19:41.693 --> 1:19:43.653
How much is my brother paying you?

1:19:44.988 --> 1:19:47.240
A reputation is not for sale.

1:19:47.324 --> 1:19:50.535
No? Not even for 30 billion won?

1:19:55.791 --> 1:19:58.502
-Sorry, baby.
-Wait. Wait.

1:19:58.585 --> 1:20:01.379
-Keep talking.
-This is bullshit. She's lying!

1:20:03.632 --> 1:20:05.884
[men grunting]

1:20:17.771 --> 1:20:19.856
[grunts]

1:20:29.366 --> 1:20:31.618
Wow!

1:20:33.453 --> 1:20:34.871
Are you all right?

1:20:34.955 --> 1:20:36.331
[exhales]

1:20:37.123 --> 1:20:38.667
Thanks to you.

1:20:39.251 --> 1:20:40.961
That's what family's for.

1:20:49.594 --> 1:20:53.390
I understand pricks like Bendix.
I deal with them every day.

1:20:53.473 --> 1:20:57.185
We know. But there's too many other women
who need this shelter.

1:20:58.436 --> 1:21:00.063
Do you know where you'll go?

1:21:05.235 --> 1:21:06.820
So where did you honeymoon?

1:21:07.904 --> 1:21:09.698
Positano, Italy.

1:21:10.282 --> 1:21:13.285
Well, you're gonna love this place.

1:21:13.368 --> 1:21:15.579
It has so much space.

1:21:16.997 --> 1:21:20.959
There's an ideal room for a nursery
just off the master suite.

1:21:21.042 --> 1:21:24.546
And I'll miss that girl from Schmitten.
Fatima.

1:21:24.629 --> 1:21:26.339
[indistinct]

1:21:26.423 --> 1:21:27.799
-What?
-Yeah!

1:21:35.473 --> 1:21:37.142
[no audible dialogue]

1:21:37.225 --> 1:21:39.436
[woman] There's something I want
to show you upstairs.

1:21:58.163 --> 1:21:59.456
Are you sure about this?

1:22:00.999 --> 1:22:04.586
If I was sure about this,
I would've suggested it a long time ago.

1:22:16.097 --> 1:22:18.975
-So did you fuck her?
-Ah. No, but I...

1:22:19.059 --> 1:22:20.936
-The plunge pool.
-[Rajan] Wow.

1:22:21.019 --> 1:22:23.521
It's so lovely to watch the sunset
from up here.

1:22:24.481 --> 1:22:27.734
[voice fading] Just puts me in the mood.

1:22:32.906 --> 1:22:34.574
Carry on without me. I'm beat.

1:22:34.658 --> 1:22:37.953
What? My man is calling quits?
Say it isn't so.

1:22:40.997 --> 1:22:43.541
What? Are you too drunk
to get the key in the lock?

1:22:43.625 --> 1:22:45.418
Shh. [indistinct whisper]

1:22:55.887 --> 1:22:57.222
Kala?

1:23:03.979 --> 1:23:05.522
-Hi.
-Hi.

1:23:09.818 --> 1:23:10.860
Hurry.

1:23:13.321 --> 1:23:14.656
[door closes, locks]

1:23:14.739 --> 1:23:16.032
How are you?

1:23:16.992 --> 1:23:18.118
Fine.

1:23:19.494 --> 1:23:22.998
There is a story you put three men
in the hospital.

1:23:23.707 --> 1:23:25.500
It is not a story.

1:23:28.837 --> 1:23:30.964
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

1:23:32.590 --> 1:23:37.387
Christian didn't believe one man could do
what everyone is saying you did.

1:23:37.470 --> 1:23:39.639
Volker Bohm.

1:23:40.265 --> 1:23:42.267
Why don't you take a walk, Felix.

1:23:42.350 --> 1:23:44.144
This is a conversation for adults.

1:23:45.020 --> 1:23:46.521
We have nothing to talk about.

1:23:46.604 --> 1:23:49.190
Take your weisswurst
and get the fuck out of here.

1:23:59.159 --> 1:24:02.245
Hello, Angels!

1:24:02.328 --> 1:24:03.997
[cackles]

1:24:04.080 --> 1:24:05.582
Get in here!

1:24:07.208 --> 1:24:09.377
Buddy!

1:24:10.295 --> 1:24:11.713
Welcome!

1:24:15.633 --> 1:24:17.385
[chuckling]

1:24:28.396 --> 1:24:30.440
Sorry. I'll tidy this up.

1:24:30.523 --> 1:24:32.567
We're just really grateful.

1:24:33.359 --> 1:24:35.236
I don't get too many guests.

1:24:37.739 --> 1:24:41.117
All right. There's two cabins.

1:24:41.201 --> 1:24:43.578
You are welcome to the big one.

1:24:47.082 --> 1:24:49.292
Bug's Love Grotto.

1:24:50.335 --> 1:24:52.420
I think we're happy with the small one.

1:24:53.046 --> 1:24:54.214
Yeah.

1:24:59.344 --> 1:25:00.345
Suit yourself.

1:25:01.096 --> 1:25:02.430
It's down here.

1:25:02.514 --> 1:25:04.682
Silas has wonderful news.

1:25:04.766 --> 1:25:09.187
He's building a clinic to provide
free healthcare to everyone in this area.

1:25:09.270 --> 1:25:11.397
It is the right of all people
to have health care.

1:25:12.065 --> 1:25:13.608
Also a good way to smuggle drugs.

1:25:15.110 --> 1:25:16.778
-Launder money.
-Capheus!

1:25:19.864 --> 1:25:22.117
[speaking Dutch]
I also have some Narcon.

1:25:26.454 --> 1:25:27.622
Great.

1:25:28.998 --> 1:25:30.083
Thank you.

1:25:30.583 --> 1:25:31.751
Anything else?

1:25:34.254 --> 1:25:35.713
A laxative.

1:25:42.095 --> 1:25:43.346
I heard her.

1:25:43.930 --> 1:25:47.809
I didn't understand the language, but if
he had been here, he'd have heard it.

1:25:48.601 --> 1:25:51.563
-Just takes one mistake.
-Yeah, I know. I'll be more careful.

1:25:52.397 --> 1:25:54.023
[softly] Listen to me.

1:25:54.899 --> 1:25:57.485
Just do what they say.

1:25:57.569 --> 1:26:02.323
If you don't,
they may never let you out of here.

1:26:03.116 --> 1:26:05.118
[guard] Hey. Come on.

1:26:11.791 --> 1:26:12.876
[door locking]

1:26:14.919 --> 1:26:16.296
What's this?

1:26:18.631 --> 1:26:20.967
I thought you might want to call your dad.

1:26:21.634 --> 1:26:22.844
It's almost November.

1:26:23.845 --> 1:26:27.223
You know they're watching them.
I can't do that. No.

1:26:27.307 --> 1:26:30.268
Nomi said it would be fine
if you threw it out right after.

1:26:33.229 --> 1:26:34.939
He wouldn't be able to understand.

1:26:36.608 --> 1:26:39.402
I'm sure everyone in Kibera
would have the same idea.

1:26:40.445 --> 1:26:43.740
I know I've done things to warrant
your skepticism, Capheus.

1:26:43.823 --> 1:26:45.867
But do you not believe a man can change?

1:26:52.040 --> 1:26:54.918
I've watched you. All your life.

1:26:55.710 --> 1:26:57.837
You have greatness in you, Wolfgang.

1:26:58.755 --> 1:27:01.090
You don't belong in a shitty apartment.

1:27:02.508 --> 1:27:04.093
Are you insulting my home?

1:27:04.177 --> 1:27:06.137
I mean no offense.

1:27:06.721 --> 1:27:09.807
I've come here as one
who understands your worth.

1:27:11.226 --> 1:27:17.440
I've come to offer you wealth, power
and pussy like you have never known.

1:27:18.316 --> 1:27:21.653
Um... whatever pussy you might
be hiding under there,

1:27:21.736 --> 1:27:23.947
I can tell you we've no interest.

1:27:27.242 --> 1:27:28.243
[coughs]

1:27:34.874 --> 1:27:38.586
You and I could own this city.

1:27:41.005 --> 1:27:44.050
If I was interested, it'd already be mine.

1:27:47.679 --> 1:27:48.846
Hmm.

1:28:13.121 --> 1:28:14.622
[groans softly]

1:28:18.418 --> 1:28:19.752
What are you doing?

1:28:21.296 --> 1:28:23.756
Watching my career die in real time.

1:28:29.846 --> 1:28:32.015
You promised you wouldn't do that anymore.

1:28:34.392 --> 1:28:37.061
I know, but it's an addiction.

1:28:39.939 --> 1:28:44.861
As painful as it is, that's still nothing
compared to what I'm really afraid of.

1:28:48.698 --> 1:28:49.532
Mama?

1:28:52.076 --> 1:28:53.453
[sighs]

1:28:53.536 --> 1:28:54.787
Mama.

1:29:04.672 --> 1:29:07.467
[Western-themed ringtone plays]

1:29:16.351 --> 1:29:17.435
Hello.

1:29:20.730 --> 1:29:21.939
Hello!

1:29:23.566 --> 1:29:26.652
[Will sighs over phone, sniffles]

1:29:29.655 --> 1:29:30.531
Will?

1:29:30.615 --> 1:29:32.533
[stammers] Is that you?

1:29:33.659 --> 1:29:35.119
[sniffles]

1:29:35.536 --> 1:29:37.080
Hey, Dad. It's me.

1:29:39.499 --> 1:29:40.666
[sighs]

1:29:41.292 --> 1:29:43.336
Oh, my fucking God.

1:29:43.419 --> 1:29:45.421
Oh, my fucking God.

1:29:45.505 --> 1:29:49.425
I'm sorry I haven't called. I just...
I don't know. I...

1:29:49.509 --> 1:29:50.968
I couldn't.

1:29:51.052 --> 1:29:53.179
[sighs] Willie.

1:29:54.180 --> 1:29:55.723
Oh...

1:29:55.807 --> 1:29:57.600
[stammers] Where are you?

1:29:57.683 --> 1:29:59.644
Are you okay?

1:30:00.436 --> 1:30:03.773
I can't talk about that right now, Dad.
I just, uh...

1:30:03.856 --> 1:30:05.691
wanted to hear your voice.

1:30:06.275 --> 1:30:08.402
Listen to me, okay? Um...

1:30:09.862 --> 1:30:11.322
You gotta get home.

1:30:11.405 --> 1:30:12.615
I mean, it's...

1:30:13.950 --> 1:30:16.452
it's Thanksgiving, for Christ's sakes.

1:30:16.536 --> 1:30:19.580
-You love Thanksgiving.
-Dad, I just wanted to let you know that

1:30:19.664 --> 1:30:22.166
I'm okay. I'm okay, Dad.

1:30:22.250 --> 1:30:23.751
-I'm okay.
-You're not okay!

1:30:23.835 --> 1:30:27.839
There are government agents saying
all kinds of fucked-up shit about you.

1:30:27.922 --> 1:30:31.384
Dad, don't... don't believe them.
Don't believe them. It's not true.

1:30:31.467 --> 1:30:33.427
If it's not true, good.
We got nothing to worry about.

1:30:33.511 --> 1:30:36.180
Why can't you tell me what's going on?

1:30:40.601 --> 1:30:43.020
Because it's about Sara, Dad.

1:30:46.065 --> 1:30:47.191
Oh, no.

1:30:47.984 --> 1:30:50.278
-Dad, you gotta believe me.
-No. Ah, fuck.

1:30:50.361 --> 1:30:52.822
It's not just--
It's more than just her, okay?

1:30:54.365 --> 1:30:56.742
-Will...
-You've gotta believe me.

1:30:56.826 --> 1:30:58.202
...you need help.

1:30:58.286 --> 1:31:00.621
-You need to get home.
-Are you drinking?

1:31:00.705 --> 1:31:01.873
[father snorts]

1:31:01.956 --> 1:31:05.334
-What do-- What do you care?
-You're not supposed to be drinking.

1:31:05.418 --> 1:31:07.086
You're not here!

1:31:07.170 --> 1:31:08.671
Four months!

1:31:08.754 --> 1:31:10.006
Four fucking months!

1:31:11.090 --> 1:31:13.676
-I don't know if you're dead or alive!
-I gotta go.

1:31:13.759 --> 1:31:15.553
-You're not here!
-[sighs]

1:31:15.636 --> 1:31:18.681
-Bye, Dad.
-Wait a minute. No. Willie. Willie.

1:31:18.764 --> 1:31:20.683
-Please?
-I love you.

1:31:20.766 --> 1:31:22.476
You gotta get home.

1:31:22.560 --> 1:31:24.020
-Son--
-I can't.

1:31:37.825 --> 1:31:40.328
I'm not saying he can't do it.

1:31:40.411 --> 1:31:44.123
I'm just thinking out loud,
or in your head?

1:31:44.207 --> 1:31:48.544
Or whatever I'm doing. I'm just wondering,
do we need to consider another strategy?

1:31:50.713 --> 1:31:56.177
Right now, Will is our strategy.
And that is enough for me.

1:32:01.015 --> 1:32:02.225
Is it time?

1:32:03.434 --> 1:32:06.938
Are you sure you wanna do this?
Because we don't have to do this.

1:32:07.021 --> 1:32:09.774
We could... talk about something?
Anything?

1:32:09.857 --> 1:32:14.570
Like how we're working on a hack
of the prison transfer system

1:32:14.654 --> 1:32:15.780
to get you out of there.

1:32:15.863 --> 1:32:17.490
No, I have to watch it.

1:32:17.573 --> 1:32:20.576
I just don't want it to upset you.

1:32:20.660 --> 1:32:24.247
-I will not be upset.
-It's just that this is a new laptop and--

1:32:24.330 --> 1:32:25.748
No, I will not be upset.

1:32:27.291 --> 1:32:28.459
Again.

1:32:30.086 --> 1:32:31.545
[exhales] Okay.

1:32:34.215 --> 1:32:35.549
Welcome to Smart Money.

1:32:35.633 --> 1:32:39.470
Our guest today is Joong-Ki Bak,
CEO of Bak Industries.

1:32:39.553 --> 1:32:41.347
So let me set the stage.

1:32:41.430 --> 1:32:44.517
Bak Industries looked like
it was on its last legs,

1:32:44.600 --> 1:32:47.311
first wrecked by embezzlement and scandal,

1:32:47.395 --> 1:32:50.690
and the death of your father,
who began the company 25 years ago.

1:32:51.816 --> 1:32:53.276
It was a terrible loss.

1:32:54.527 --> 1:32:55.945
-[Nomi] Hey.
-[Amanita] Hey.

1:32:57.321 --> 1:32:59.657
-Is that...?
-It's started.

1:33:01.158 --> 1:33:03.035
Is she gonna bust your laptop again?

1:33:06.455 --> 1:33:09.083
...you are the proverbial Phoenix
from the ashes.

1:33:09.166 --> 1:33:10.001
[Joong-Ki chuckles]

1:33:10.084 --> 1:33:12.211
[woman] To what do you attribute
your amazing success?

1:33:12.295 --> 1:33:13.671
[Joong-Ki] Well, uh...

1:33:13.754 --> 1:33:15.798
[Joong-Ki continues in Korean]

1:33:15.881 --> 1:33:20.136
-I didn't know she could speak Korean.
-Nom's full of surprises.

1:33:20.720 --> 1:33:21.804
[chuckles]

1:33:21.887 --> 1:33:23.431
Buddy!

1:33:23.514 --> 1:33:25.975
[Joong-Ki] ...fresh start, a rebranding.

1:33:26.058 --> 1:33:29.937
So you feel the company has fully
recovered from your sister's actions?

1:33:30.771 --> 1:33:35.067
I understand she attacked you
when you tried to visit her.

1:33:35.151 --> 1:33:37.111
My sister is troubled.

1:33:37.903 --> 1:33:42.033
But she's still my family and...
I love her.

1:33:42.116 --> 1:33:43.909
People can change.

1:33:44.577 --> 1:33:47.330
And it's my hope that prison will help her

1:33:47.413 --> 1:33:51.542
become the kind of person
that our father would be proud of.

1:33:56.505 --> 1:33:57.381
[chuckles]

1:34:02.762 --> 1:34:03.971
Sorry.

1:34:16.400 --> 1:34:17.360
[Kala] Ooh!

1:34:18.319 --> 1:34:20.363
[laughing]

1:34:20.446 --> 1:34:22.990
Oh, my God! I have never seen snow!

1:34:23.074 --> 1:34:25.910
Wow! [giggles]

1:34:31.415 --> 1:34:32.917
[gasps]

1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:38.381
Ah, just give it a few days,
when the oil and the soot and the dirt

1:34:38.464 --> 1:34:39.590
turns it into a mess.

1:34:44.011 --> 1:34:45.388
Why do you have to do that?

1:34:45.471 --> 1:34:46.889
Do what?

1:34:47.556 --> 1:34:49.141
Ruin everything.

1:34:51.894 --> 1:34:52.978
I don't know.

1:34:54.230 --> 1:34:55.106
It's my nature?

1:34:55.773 --> 1:34:57.066
[both chuckle]

1:35:02.405 --> 1:35:04.698
-No, it isn't.
-No?

1:35:11.122 --> 1:35:12.998
You have something good...

1:35:14.166 --> 1:35:17.753
and beautiful hidden inside of you.

1:35:19.880 --> 1:35:22.967
Just as I have something dark
and wicked inside of me.

1:35:25.636 --> 1:35:27.513
We're perfect for each other.

1:35:29.932 --> 1:35:30.891
No.

1:35:32.268 --> 1:35:33.352
Why?

1:35:33.978 --> 1:35:35.729
Because we have to change.

1:35:37.523 --> 1:35:39.316
Become better people.

1:35:40.484 --> 1:35:42.611
-What if I don't want to change?
-[chuckles]

1:35:48.242 --> 1:35:49.285
You do.

1:35:52.997 --> 1:35:54.415
You know what I want?

1:35:56.667 --> 1:35:57.668
Yes.

1:35:58.919 --> 1:36:00.754
I'm afraid I do.

1:36:05.426 --> 1:36:07.678
[giggling]

1:36:07.761 --> 1:36:09.388
-Oh, shit!
-[laughing]

1:36:11.307 --> 1:36:13.642
[both laughing, shouting]

1:36:30.075 --> 1:36:31.452
I'm a badass motherfucker.

1:36:36.749 --> 1:36:37.833
Wolfgang!

1:36:38.459 --> 1:36:44.256
Wolfgang! What the fuck are you on?
And where can I get some?

1:37:14.036 --> 1:37:15.496
[camera clicks]

1:37:16.789 --> 1:37:18.249
[chuckles]

1:37:19.333 --> 1:37:21.877
-Check it out.
-Neets, come on!

1:37:21.961 --> 1:37:23.671
-We're gonna be late.
-[Amanita] One sec!

1:37:26.590 --> 1:37:28.259
What is this?

1:37:29.176 --> 1:37:30.427
Evil Santa.

1:37:34.014 --> 1:37:35.933
I don't know about this, Riley.

1:37:36.016 --> 1:37:39.770
Oh, come on. He has a family.

1:37:39.853 --> 1:37:41.647
He won't be looking for you tonight.

1:37:42.273 --> 1:37:43.983
I would if I were him.

1:37:44.066 --> 1:37:48.320
[sighs] We have to have one night
that we're not afraid of him.

1:37:53.117 --> 1:37:54.660
[door opening]

1:37:57.746 --> 1:38:00.708
-Felix, you better go inside.
-Come on. I can't get shot again.

1:38:00.791 --> 1:38:03.627
I just came out of the hospital.
That would be terrible plotting.

1:38:04.253 --> 1:38:05.546
Going to Grace's?

1:38:05.629 --> 1:38:10.676
I love her to pieces but her idea
of Christmas is like a triathlon.

1:38:10.759 --> 1:38:14.722
Christmas Kitchen for the homeless,
children's hospital, then home for dinner.

1:38:14.805 --> 1:38:17.182
-Finally, midnight Queer Choir.
-[chuckles]

1:38:18.142 --> 1:38:19.310
Sounds intense.

1:38:19.393 --> 1:38:22.187
[Daniela] Oh, my God, Lito!

1:38:23.272 --> 1:38:25.566
This is beautiful!
You bought this for your mother?

1:38:25.649 --> 1:38:27.109
Yeah.

1:38:27.943 --> 1:38:30.237
She, more than anyone,
always believed in me.

1:38:30.863 --> 1:38:34.533
With the check from my first big movie,
I wanted to tell her thank you.

1:38:35.326 --> 1:38:37.953
Wow! [chuckles]

1:38:38.037 --> 1:38:39.413
What is this for?

1:38:39.913 --> 1:38:42.833
A token of my respect and gratitude.

1:38:42.916 --> 1:38:49.590
You did this city a huge service and
it was high time someone said thank you.

1:38:50.215 --> 1:38:51.634
-Ready?
-Yeah.

1:39:00.100 --> 1:39:01.226
What?

1:39:01.310 --> 1:39:02.770
[chuckling] What...?

1:39:04.063 --> 1:39:05.898
-Ice-skating.
-Yeah.

1:39:07.441 --> 1:39:10.277
-I don't know how to ice-skate.
-Yes, you do.

1:39:10.361 --> 1:39:11.904
Because I do.

1:39:16.700 --> 1:39:20.120
Wow! Kala, what's all this?

1:39:20.204 --> 1:39:23.040
-I felt like celebrating.
-[laughs]

1:39:23.123 --> 1:39:26.001
I usually just hang with the virts.

1:39:26.627 --> 1:39:27.544
Virts?

1:39:27.628 --> 1:39:29.588
You know, virtual family,
online community?

1:39:30.339 --> 1:39:32.049
We're all pretty tight.

1:39:32.132 --> 1:39:35.094
Though we don't actually know each other.

1:39:35.177 --> 1:39:36.887
Well, that's not true.

1:39:36.970 --> 1:39:40.265
In some ways,
they know more about me than anybody.

1:39:40.349 --> 1:39:44.645
But we've never actually met,
you know, physically.

1:39:44.728 --> 1:39:47.690
-Make sense?
-Yeah.

1:39:52.695 --> 1:39:53.779
Hey...

1:39:54.488 --> 1:39:57.616
whatever happens,
I want you to know that I am here.

1:39:59.201 --> 1:40:00.577
Okay. Come on.

1:40:03.914 --> 1:40:07.334
-[Nomi gasps]
-Let's X-mas!

1:40:07.418 --> 1:40:09.545
-You look amazing!
-I know, right?

1:40:09.628 --> 1:40:11.255
[both laughing]

1:40:13.757 --> 1:40:14.591
You coming?

1:40:16.969 --> 1:40:17.803
Really?

1:40:19.138 --> 1:40:19.972
Yeah.

1:40:23.892 --> 1:40:25.227
Okay.

1:40:26.979 --> 1:40:28.147
Mama?

1:40:36.530 --> 1:40:37.740
Mama?

1:40:40.576 --> 1:40:41.660
Mama?

1:40:49.001 --> 1:40:50.252
[sighs]

1:40:50.794 --> 1:40:52.212
[footsteps approaching]

1:40:56.508 --> 1:40:58.552
I always save your clippings.

1:40:59.928 --> 1:41:03.640
The good, the bad and the inevitable.

1:41:04.558 --> 1:41:07.019
-Mama--
-This wasn't the hard part.

1:41:07.102 --> 1:41:10.939
And it wasn't the friends
thrusting the pictures in my face

1:41:11.023 --> 1:41:14.359
with their sincerest condolences.

1:41:15.861 --> 1:41:18.197
I never had so many friends call.

1:41:18.822 --> 1:41:23.160
Who knew I was so popular? [laughs]

1:41:24.286 --> 1:41:31.126
Dear friends, dear colleagues, dear all:

1:41:31.210 --> 1:41:34.546

-Of course.

to break into classified files,

1:48:51.107 --> 1:48:55.403

he did flee the country to Iceland

one of our research facilities.
