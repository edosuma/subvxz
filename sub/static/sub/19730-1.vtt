From what we're told, the initial reports say that
the suspect willingly submitted to questioning.

01:37.163 --> 01:40.303
When we explained that he'd be transferred
into Public Security's custody,

01:40.633 --> 01:42.977
he almost seemed
happy about it.

01:43.536 --> 01:44.776
Happy?

01:44.871 --> 01:45.747
Yes...

01:46.072 --> 01:47.483
That doesn't make
much sense.

01:48.475 --> 01:52.753
So, the Big Man isn't
gonna meet up with us'?

01:53.713 --> 01:56.125
He said he's gonna stick with his
"I only work cases that I pick...

01:56.249 --> 01:58.695
...based on what my gut tells me" policy
and sit this one out, too.

01:59.519 --> 02:02.500
Still, the fact is that we were only able
to connect the dots in this case...

the frontal approach.

<i>Special operatives tattooed with "true believer”

<i>...have been committing suicide
one by one here in Japan.</i>

07:09.929 --> 07:14.105
<i>And moments ago, Col. Ka Gael,
his oldest son, killed himself, too.</i>

07:14.901 --> 07:19.008
<i>You still insist there is no need to interrogate
the General in spite of these incidents?</i>

07:19.906 --> 07:23.820
<i>Some reports are saying that Col. Ka's death
was the result of a botched arrest attempt.</i>

07:24.744 --> 07:29.557
<i>Even assuming that indiscriminate terrorist acts
are being planned by Seok Republic holdouts,</i>

07:29.882 --> 07:35.332
<i>I find it hard to imagine that General Ka is
involved in the plan while under house arrest.</i>

<i>Understood, ma'am.</i>

08:00.646 --> 08:01.681
We're moving out!

08:02.248 --> 08:05.354
Is this wise, sir'? I don't believe she
gave you authorization for that.

08:07.920 --> 08:13.802
If no one finds out that I opened Pandora's
Box, I didn't break my word to her.

08:27.373 --> 08:31.219
7072. Has the scene provided you
with any new material data'?

08:31.544 --> 08:33.284
No, sir, I haven't
found anything yet.

08:33.379 --> 08:36.758
Call in the Supervisor.
There's some old--

08:36.982 --> 08:37.984
<i>Batou.</i>

08:39.452 --> 08:40.760
<i>Are you listening
to me, Batou?</i>

08:42.388 --> 08:44.197
<i>Yeah, I'm listening.</i>

<i>Where are you?</i>

<i>We found the body o!
a 13th tattooed man.</i>

08:54.467 --> 08:56.879
- <i>Is this one another suicide?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

08:58.070 --> 09:03.486
<i>This place looks a lot like our own safe houses.
I! was probably one of their hideouts.</i>

09:03.943 --> 09:08.392
<i>Let the Prefectural Police handle this. Grab one
of you! subordinates and go to this location.</i>

09:09.815 --> 09:11.988
<i>It's a secret hideout that Ka Gael
told us about in his debriefing.</i>

09:13.853 --> 09:18.529
<i>You sure that a mainstream job like that
isn't more up Togusa's alley?</i>

09:18.991 --> 09:21.972
<i>Togusa's coming with me
to the Dungeon.</i>

09:23.262 --> 09:24.240
<i>Ah, I follow you.</i>

09:31.237 --> 09:32.181
Togusa.

09:33.306 --> 09:36.719
How long has it been since the
Major resigned from Section 9'?

09:37.643 --> 09:39.987
It's coming up on
two years now, I guess.

09:41.180 --> 09:42.716
That long...

09:43.749 --> 09:46.923
I'm sorry about what
happened with Ka Gael.

09:47.253 --> 09:48.891
There was nothing you
could have done.

09:49.355 --> 09:54.600
This is a vital matter which might prove to be
Prime Minister Kayabuki's Achilles' heel.

09:55.094 --> 09:59.406
Her intention is probably to keep a lid on
things that she doesn't want to see right now.

10:00.066 --> 10:03.707
Still, Kayabuki was scared that the other
countries at the six-party talks would...

10:04.036 --> 10:07.245
...look too closely at the real motivation
behind the Refugee Naturalization Policy.

10:07.573 --> 10:12.079
This whole damn mess got started because
she was forced into looking after Ka Rum!

10:13.012 --> 10:16.755
That's because even before General Ka picked
Japan as the country he'd seek asylum in,

10:17.283 --> 10:20.287
he said that he'd carry out
acts of terrorism in retaliation.

10:20.786 --> 10:24.495
"At the moment of my death, I will
visit terror throughout the world."

10:25.257 --> 10:29.103
You mean that retribution declaration that was
in the speech he gave when Seok fell, huh'?

10:29.795 --> 10:34.437
Now that we've learned about it, it's our
job to do something about it, right'?

10:35.334 --> 10:40.374
It's unclear how he's been issuing orders from
an island that's cut off from the outside world,

10:40.706 --> 10:44.916
but if we take Ka Rum himself into custody, we
should be able to get a feel for the overall plan.

10:45.678 --> 10:49.649
We'll also learn how far along
this terrorist plot is right now.

10:51.450 --> 10:53.862
Chief. We just got word
from the Coast Guard...

10:53.986 --> 10:56.933
...that they've opened up the
airspace over the island.

10:57.590 --> 11:00.503
Good. Thank them for me
and take us down at once.

11:00.993 --> 11:02.995
Make sure you doctor the records
of our flight plan!

11:03.095 --> 11:04.301
Roger that!

11:47.273 --> 11:50.152
<i>No firearms or knives detected!
Clear!</i>

12:00.352 --> 12:03.526
<i>Proto. Tum the power back on
and open the blinds.</i>

12:04.223 --> 12:05.258
<i>Roger.</i>

12:13.632 --> 12:15.134
What's the matter'?

12:16.569 --> 12:17.741
Chief...

12:22.441 --> 12:24.682
It looks like he pulled
them out himself.

12:28.314 --> 12:29.987
This is bad news...

12:30.082 --> 12:34.861
If he's killed himself, too, their plan
might already be in motion.

12:38.791 --> 12:39.326
What's that'?

12:39.425 --> 12:42.338
This'? It's a terminal that links
to the nursing net.

12:42.762 --> 12:47.302
Basically, it's used to exchange a patient's
medical data with all medical facilities.

12:47.800 --> 12:53.307
Looks like those rumors about Ka Rum being
seriously ill before he ﬂed his country were true.

12:55.007 --> 12:58.454
The government has no idea that he's dead,
even though he was hooked up to that'?

12:58.778 --> 13:00.052
Hm'? Bingo!

13:00.146 --> 13:02.786
He was going through a back door
in the system!

13:03.048 --> 13:05.688
I guess there was more to the good
General here than meets the eye.

13:05.785 --> 13:11.167
Looks that way. The comm log shows
that he was in contact with his people.

13:11.957 --> 13:15.166
We'll need to get this back to HQ
for a thorough examination,

13:15.294 --> 13:19.640
but they definitely seemed to be planning a
terrorist strike using a micro machine virus.

13:20.199 --> 13:22.076
What do you mean,
were planning'?

13:22.501 --> 13:26.108
When his operatives started
killing themselves one by one,

13:26.438 --> 13:30.978
he talked with Ka Gael about whether they
should abort the plan for the time being.

13:31.310 --> 13:35.850
What do you mean'? Are you saying that the
suicides weren't meant as the plot's "go" code'?

13:36.348 --> 13:37.691
I don't know.

13:37.950 --> 13:42.456
But what really worries me is that there was
a program planted in here from the outside...

13:42.555 --> 13:44.933
...designed to make it look like
Ka Rum was still alive.

13:45.024 --> 13:49.632
The government probably still hasn't caught
on to the fact that this guy is dead.

13:50.262 --> 13:53.038
So, an assassination set up
to look like suicide'?

13:53.132 --> 13:57.581
Yeah. Committed by somebody who doesn't
want the government to know Ka Rum is dead.

13:57.903 --> 13:58.847
That, or...

14:00.606 --> 14:03.246
So, what about the
micro machine virus'?

14:03.342 --> 14:07.290
Looks like it was delivered to
that Ma Shaba guy's hospital.

14:07.546 --> 14:11.756
Assuming Batou isn't off playing hooky,
he might be able to recover it for us.

14:13.485 --> 14:14.463
Togusa!

14:21.994 --> 14:23.701
What the hell
is this'?

14:26.732 --> 14:28.109
"Puppeteer"?

14:29.134 --> 14:34.812
<i>Azuma, didn't Ka Gael say something
about a puppeteer just before he died?</i>

14:35.574 --> 14:37.212
<i>Y'know, I think he did...</i>

14:38.410 --> 14:41.653
The keyword "puppeteer" shows up
in this log, too.

14:41.780 --> 14:44.386
Looks like it's the codename
for one of his men.

14:45.150 --> 14:47.892
<i>Looks like we need to apprehend
Ma Shaba as soon as possible.</i>

14:47.987 --> 14:51.696
<i>Right. Once you make a dupe oi
the full log, go meet up with Batou.</i>

14:52.291 --> 14:55.295
<i>It's imperative that we ascertain
the full scope of this plot.</i>

14:55.394 --> 14:56.930
<i>What should we do
with the stiff?</i>

14:57.029 --> 15:02.809
<i>Leave everything as we found it.
I hale to do it, bu! we were never here.</i>

15:02.902 --> 15:04.176
<i>Understood.</i>

15:45.611 --> 15:47.022
A hospital'?

15:54.520 --> 15:57.091
That car sticks out like a
sore thumb around here...

16:45.804 --> 16:48.580
This security system setup
kinda reminds me of--

16:54.380 --> 16:55.450
You head around
from the outside!

16:55.581 --> 16:57.060
Roger.

17:12.598 --> 17:13.702
What the hell'?

17:20.539 --> 17:22.883
You can't hack my cyberbrain
if I'm in here!

17:23.008 --> 17:24.714
Die, Puppeteer!

17:44.196 --> 17:45.436
Went down there, huh'?

18:00.712 --> 18:01.622
Batou'?

18:06.285 --> 18:07.263
That looked like--

18:11.890 --> 18:13.995
Open

18:36.081 --> 18:37.116
Get clear!

18:51.597 --> 18:53.008
You dumb-ass!

18:56.268 --> 18:58.578
I'll come back for you later.
Play dead.

18:58.670 --> 18:59.808
Roger.

19:04.610 --> 19:05.680
Hold it!

19:15.420 --> 19:16.728
That you, Major'?

19:17.222 --> 19:21.932
It's been a long time, Batou.
So, what brings you to this part of town'?

19:22.294 --> 19:26.572
I knew it was you...
I should ask you the same thing.

19:27.432 --> 19:31.710
Conducting an investigation chosen as a result
of personal deduction, I guess you could say.

19:36.842 --> 19:37.684
Here it comes!

19:46.251 --> 19:47.161
Just a second.

19:53.592 --> 19:54.593
What the hell'?

19:54.960 --> 19:55.938
Hold on to this
for me.

19:59.798 --> 20:00.776
Hey!

20:31.263 --> 20:33.402
Hey, wait a minute...
Isn't that Ma Shaba'?

20:34.633 --> 20:35.907
I'm surprised you know
who he is.

20:36.235 --> 20:39.478
What do you mean, "surprised"?
What the hell are you up to'?

20:40.639 --> 20:42.846
Come on,
give that back.

20:43.976 --> 20:44.954
Hey!

20:57.222 --> 20:59.998
Has your taste
in cars changed'?

21:02.761 --> 21:04.331
When did she
swipe my--

21:04.896 --> 21:06.341
Still, this isn't
too shabby at all.

21:09.101 --> 21:12.014
Batou, I'm guessing that the reason
you're here is because...

21:12.337 --> 21:15.750
...you're following a lead on that
string of suicides of tattooed men.

21:16.675 --> 21:18.780
But let me give you
a friendly warning.

21:19.144 --> 21:21.181
Stay away from the
Solid State.

21:21.513 --> 21:24.687
Otherwise, you'll end up killing
yourself just like they did.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.127
- Hey, wait a --
- You can find your car yourself.

21:39.898 --> 21:42.777
Didn't I tell you to bring along
one of your men'?!

21:45.404 --> 21:48.385
I know, that's why I brought
this hunk of junk.

21:51.276 --> 21:54.189
We got here too late.
Ma Shaba is dead, too.

21:54.446 --> 21:55.447
Cause of death'?

21:55.547 --> 21:58.255
Neck trauma resulting from
impacts during the runaway.

21:58.717 --> 22:01.288
Looks like Ma Shaba
wasn't the Puppeteer.

22:03.388 --> 22:06.301
Batou, why the hell did he
attack you in that thing'?

22:07.092 --> 22:10.369
Beats me. That's what
I'd like to know.

22:10.696 --> 22:14.200
Maybe he attacked you because he
thought you were the Puppeteer.

22:14.333 --> 22:17.473
Hey, what's this "Puppeteer"
you keep talking about'?

22:18.070 --> 22:23.179
It's all still speculation at this point,
but it seems to be a rebel's codename.

22:23.675 --> 22:26.747
We have reason to believe that deaths
of the tattooed men and Ka Rum...

22:26.845 --> 22:29.018
...were all crimes orchestrated
by this person.

22:29.448 --> 22:32.793
He hacks other people's cyberbrains
and forces them to commit suicide.

22:32.884 --> 22:36.798
Judging from the skill of the hacks, we seem to
be dealing with a super-wizard class hacker.

22:37.522 --> 22:39.092
Wizard-class'?

22:39.491 --> 22:43.906
<i>Chief, we figured out how Ka Ram's
terrorist attack was going to work.</i>

22:43.995 --> 22:45.167
<i>What did you learn?</i>

22:46.164 --> 22:48.144
<i>You should come see this
for yourself.</i>

22:50.335 --> 22:53.646
<i>It looks like Ka Rum was trying
to spread his virus...</i>

22:53.972 --> 22:56.452
<i>...by implanting children
with micro machines.</i>

22:56.975 --> 22:59.979
Are you kidding me'?!
"Retaliatory terrorism," my ass!

23:00.312 --> 23:02.918
No human being could come up
with something this sick!

24:33.672 --> 24:36.778
Section 9 is going to figure out
my M.O. one of these days.

24:37.275 --> 24:40.051
Loki, Conan, hold the fort
while I'm gone.

24:52.390 --> 24:56.065
Looks like controlling two prosthetic
bodies at once is my limit.

25:03.101 --> 25:07.550
I suppose our only option is to start
their training again from square one.

25:07.772 --> 25:11.743
Really'? Damn, and we even tried
using natural oil again...

25:11.843 --> 25:15.985
Yes. But in the end, the observers have
changed, so perhaps this means...

25:16.314 --> 25:19.921
...that their previous environment
hasn't been perfectly replicated.

25:22.287 --> 25:25.427
You're still obsessing over
their development, huh'?

25:33.798 --> 25:36.472
Africa was a lot harsher
than I imagined.

25:37.202 --> 25:40.149
I got some new prosthetics before
I left, but it still hit me hard.

25:40.539 --> 25:43.520
If you start supplementing your
cardiopulmonary functions with prosthetics,

25:43.842 --> 25:45.480
your O2 extraction rate's
gonna take a hit.

25:46.011 --> 25:49.254
I didn't have much choice.
Not as long as I'm working here.

25:49.714 --> 25:53.093
First Togusa, now you...
I gotta hand it to you guys.

25:58.290 --> 26:00.099
From the roster we found
at their hideout,

26:00.191 --> 26:02.797
we've determined that the group
is composed of 16 members:

26:02.894 --> 26:06.273
The 13 members who committed suicide,
plus Ka Gael, Ma Shaba,

26:06.398 --> 26:08.378
and someone named
Raj Puhto.

26:08.800 --> 26:13.840
Who's this Raj Puhto guy'? What's the
likelihood of him being the Puppeteer'?

26:14.506 --> 26:17.453
He doesn't seem to have successfully
entered the country yet.

26:17.976 --> 26:20.582
We've verified that much from
their communications log.

26:21.079 --> 26:23.992
There aren't a whole lot of people
who will follow you to the grave...

26:24.082 --> 26:25.993
...when you tell 'em
to die with you.

26:26.318 --> 26:29.458
Things always seem to work out that way
when dictators buy the farm.

26:29.888 --> 26:32.994
Still, 16 people is nothing
to sneeze at...

26:37.095 --> 26:38.870
Where have you been,
Batou'?

26:39.297 --> 26:40.503
When'd you get back'?

26:40.599 --> 26:43.580
Just now.
Sorry, don't let me interrupt you.

26:53.378 --> 26:54.880
Okay, let's continue.
Next.

26:56.681 --> 27:02.063
As for the missing micro machine virus,
one gross, a total of 144 ampules,

27:02.187 --> 27:03.996
was brought into
the country.

27:04.456 --> 27:05.935
The ampules contain
a bio-chem weapon,

27:06.024 --> 27:09.904
a genetically-engineered form of smallpox
that's had a time-release function added.

27:11.363 --> 27:14.276
That's one nasty little bug
that they lost track of...

27:16.768 --> 27:17.678
Batou.

27:20.138 --> 27:22.140
There's something that
I need to make sure of.

27:23.041 --> 27:27.387
You're sure that you didn't see
anyone at Ma Shaba's hospital'?

27:27.979 --> 27:28.787
Yeah.

27:29.114 --> 27:33.756
And when that robot went berserk, there wasn't
any indication of intervention by a third party'?

27:34.486 --> 27:35.692
Nope.

27:36.121 --> 27:37.395
If you say so.

27:37.489 --> 27:39.400
What exactly are
you getting at'?

27:40.492 --> 27:41.436
Well...

27:41.526 --> 27:47.841
The truth is, we weren't able to ID the owner
of that crushed car in the parking lot.

27:48.166 --> 27:50.009
Maybe it was stolen.

27:50.101 --> 27:54.174
Judging from the security setup on
that thing, that's pretty doubtful.

27:54.339 --> 27:58.219
Plus, part of the security camera
footage had been deleted.

27:59.277 --> 28:02.815
I'm thinking that we should work under the
assumption that someone else was there.

28:03.381 --> 28:06.294
And that "someone"
was the Puppeteer'?

28:06.384 --> 28:07.658
Possibly.

28:08.920 --> 28:13.062
Ka Rum's plan hasn't gone
into play at this stage,

28:13.491 --> 28:18.099
but there's lots of evidence to suggest that this
"Puppeteer" hacker will pick up where Ka left off.

28:18.530 --> 28:21.977
From here on out, we'll narrow our focus to
tracking down the micro machine ampules,

28:22.100 --> 28:24.842
while investigating the Puppeteer
at the same time.

28:25.170 --> 28:26.171
Roger.

28:26.905 --> 28:27.975
Togusa.

28:29.340 --> 28:30.614
What do you want me
to do'?

28:31.042 --> 28:35.491
First off, get some F{&F{. Eliminating the main
cause of human error is your top priority.

28:35.780 --> 28:37.987
Gotcha. I'll take you up
on that offer.

28:40.985 --> 28:42.293
Oh, and Batou'?

28:46.224 --> 28:50.070
This morning, the Chief told me,
"It's about time you reeled him in."

28:50.595 --> 28:52.802
You can devote yourself full-time
to being an instructor,

28:52.897 --> 28:55.673
or you can work under me
on the Puppeteer investigation.

28:57.268 --> 29:00.078
I'll leave the choice up to you.
What'll it be'?

29:07.011 --> 29:10.322
Do you even need to ask me that'?
I'm on the Puppeteer.

29:12.617 --> 29:13.527
All right.

29:23.495 --> 29:24.803
Learn anything'?

29:24.896 --> 29:26.876
Yeah, a few things.

29:28.299 --> 29:29.505
Skip the preliminaries
and fill us in.

29:30.301 --> 29:33.680
First, I got the results back from the
medical checks we ran on the 16 kids.

29:33.805 --> 29:36.786
There were no signs that they'd been
injected with micro machines.

29:37.208 --> 29:40.451
And although they showed symptoms of
dehydration and injuries from past abuse,

29:40.845 --> 29:42.722
they're all
basically healthy.

29:44.883 --> 29:48.626
But we also found out that in each of the 16,
part of their memory had been erased,

29:48.720 --> 29:52.361
and their lD's had been rewritten
to turn them into somebody else.

29:54.092 --> 29:56.766
They could answer accurately when
asked their name or address,

29:57.262 --> 30:00.641
but when the topic turned to their parents,
they had no memories whatsoever.

30:01.332 --> 30:03.676
And when we went to check out
the addresses they gave,

30:03.802 --> 30:06.578
there was just old people there
living by themselves.

30:07.372 --> 30:09.181
Any chance that those old people
are really their parents'?

30:09.274 --> 30:10.378
Not likely.

30:10.475 --> 30:14.287
We saw everything from an old woman
living alone in a 10-by-8 room...

30:14.379 --> 30:19.124
...to a rich old coot who could afford to pay
for nursing robots out of his own pocket.

30:19.217 --> 30:21.788
But without exception, they were all
Noble Rot Senior Citizens...

30:21.886 --> 30:23.991
...who were hooked up
to the nursing system.

30:24.389 --> 30:27.859
Needless to say, there were no signs
that any children had ever lived there.

30:28.193 --> 30:32.335
The resident ledgers had "child"
listed next to their names,

30:32.430 --> 30:34.808
but those were
probably doctored, too.

30:35.633 --> 30:37.874
What are these
"Noble Rot Senior Citizens"?

30:38.236 --> 30:41.445
Apparently, the term came from the way old
people who are hooked up to what's called...

30:41.539 --> 30:44.952
...the "Fully Automatic Nursing System" and
given bare minimum medical treatment...

30:45.043 --> 30:49.219
...lie there like grapes infested with noble rot
shriveling on the vine.

30:50.148 --> 30:54.290
The system was originally developed with the
aim of solving the aging population problem,

30:54.385 --> 30:57.798
and at the same time, to prevent them
from dying alone and unnoticed.

30:58.590 --> 31:02.504
But when NPO's learned that it encouraged
patients to connect to the net and stay in bed,

31:02.827 --> 31:07.298
they started mocking it as a thinly-disguised
asset collection system.

31:07.899 --> 31:09.071
You sure know
a lot about this.

31:09.200 --> 31:12.272
I've heard all about it from the old ladies
who come to my pachinko place.

31:12.904 --> 31:16.374
It's kind of like a bare-bones version of
the model that was next to Ka Rum's bed.

31:18.243 --> 31:19.551
Hey, wait a minute.

31:19.644 --> 31:22.386
Ka Gael was trying to create
human bombs, right'?

31:23.281 --> 31:26.922
If that's true, why did he go to the trouble
of erasing their memories of their parents'?

31:27.151 --> 31:30.997
If he wanted the kids to stay inconspicuous
after he infected them with the virus,

31:31.322 --> 31:34.269
wouldn't it have been smarter to erase
the memories of the abduction...

31:34.392 --> 31:35.496
...and then send them
back home'?

31:35.593 --> 31:37.231
Hey, you're asking
the wrong guy.

31:37.362 --> 31:38.773
Yeah, you definitely
have a point there.

31:39.397 --> 31:43.106
If he even had them cyberized specifically for
his plan, he's going to an awful lot of trouble.

31:43.801 --> 31:46.975
The operations seem to have been
performed prior to the abductions.

31:47.505 --> 31:49.382
The transformers seem
to be legitimate, as well.

31:49.474 --> 31:52.353
In that case, there should be records at the
Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.

31:52.443 --> 31:54.719
Since they're all
six years old,

31:54.846 --> 31:58.953
a consent form signed by a parent
or guardian is required by law.

32:00.318 --> 32:03.128
There were 144
missing ampules...

32:04.889 --> 32:07.426
Just to be safe, we should
probably check to see...

32:07.525 --> 32:10.995
...if there are any kids listed there
who fit the same description.

32:11.095 --> 32:12.073
Good call.

32:20.772 --> 32:23.719
Ministry of Health, Labor,
and Welfare

32:49.334 --> 32:54.647
If the 16 kids we rescued had their cyberization
surgery done through legitimate channels,

32:54.973 --> 32:57.317
the records would've been
automatically recorded...

32:57.442 --> 32:59.820
...in the databases of the MHLW
and the Management Ministry.

33:00.311 --> 33:04.282
If they were abducted afterwards and
their family registries were altered...

33:04.382 --> 33:06.760
...to make them look like
those old folks' kids,

33:07.085 --> 33:10.692
there'll be a discrepancy in the number of kids
listed as cyberized in the national ID system...

33:11.089 --> 33:15.003
...and the number that's listed by the
Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare.

33:15.393 --> 33:16.337
I follow you.

33:16.427 --> 33:19.306
Since we have 16 here who say
they have the same last name...

33:19.530 --> 33:21.567
...as one of the senior citizens,
that should be true.

33:24.535 --> 33:25.445
20,000'?!

33:25.770 --> 33:27.374
There has to be some
kind of mistake.

33:28.606 --> 33:32.520
If kids were being abducted in such huge
numbers, somebody would've noticed.

33:32.610 --> 33:34.021
Yeah, you're right.

33:34.145 --> 33:38.651
Still, that number's way larger than anything
we expected. What do you want to do'?

33:38.983 --> 33:41.987
Let's start by eliminating
the worst case scenario.

33:42.787 --> 33:46.758
First, figure out the names and addresses
of the excess children in the database.

33:47.091 --> 33:49.537
I'm on it. I can have that for you
in a few seconds.

33:55.366 --> 33:56.344
A trap?!

33:58.302 --> 34:01.977
This is an emergency.
Class E virus detected.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.316
Shut down all
equipment immediately.

34:04.409 --> 34:05.285
This is an emergency...

34:05.376 --> 34:06.946
Beginning virus scan.

34:07.045 --> 34:10.254
- Vaccine pattern match in progress.
- Shut down all equipment immediately.

34:10.681 --> 34:12.991
Incursion into server
has reached...

34:17.487 --> 34:19.489
It's no use! It's not accepting
any commands!

34:19.590 --> 34:22.434
Higaki! Soga! Lock down
the backup server!

34:22.893 --> 34:25.101
Too late! It's already
been compromised!

34:25.295 --> 34:27.003
We've gotta cut the
damn power, then!

34:27.331 --> 34:28.536
Gimme a hand!

34:29.266 --> 34:32.248
There was a virus planted in the
Management Ministry's database'?

34:32.837 --> 34:34.612
Data's disappearing
on their side, too!

34:34.739 --> 34:36.775
The MHLW's data
is intact?

34:36.873 --> 34:38.547
Yeah. Hell if I know
why, though.

34:46.784 --> 34:47.558
Move it!

34:51.188 --> 34:52.600
Management Ministry
database is--

35:06.237 --> 35:11.277
I bet the Management Ministry's buzzing
like a poked beehive right about now.

35:11.909 --> 35:15.254
Shit, we just lost the
best lead we had...

35:15.746 --> 35:20.718
Only if it turns out that there really
were 20,000 abductions.

35:22.186 --> 35:23.256
What do you mean'?

35:23.688 --> 35:26.100
Common sense says there's no way
that Ka Gael's crew...

35:26.190 --> 35:28.397
...could have pulled off
that many abductions.

35:28.826 --> 35:32.035
Even if we say that they were the work
of this hacker, the Puppeteer.

35:32.697 --> 35:34.677
The M.O. is just
too sloppy.

35:35.299 --> 35:37.540
If he really wanted to cover up
the abductions,

35:37.635 --> 35:41.105
don't you think it's strange that he'd leave traces
of tampering in just the national ID system'?

35:41.739 --> 35:45.744
This way, it's almost like he's saying,
"I've nabbed these kids, now please find them."

35:46.611 --> 35:51.185
Me, I think he's got
something else in mind.

35:53.351 --> 35:55.763
I have to concur
with your opinion.

35:56.754 --> 35:57.732
Chief'?

36:08.432 --> 36:13.279
These were delivered to the MHLW's
Pathogenic Microorganism Isolation Facility.

36:13.604 --> 36:17.074
Analysis has identified them as a
Seek-produced micro machine virus.

36:17.508 --> 36:20.318
This would certainly seem to suggest
that our intel was indeed correct.

36:20.912 --> 36:22.858
What did the person who
delivered it look like'?

36:23.147 --> 36:28.460
There were no records remaining that
might show who delivered it, or when.

36:29.720 --> 36:32.428
So there's a chance that this person
might be the Puppeteer'?

36:32.590 --> 36:34.069
It's certainly possible.

36:34.392 --> 36:38.067
If that's the case, what's the Puppeteer's
final objective in all this'?

36:38.496 --> 36:41.102
It wasn't to keep Ka's
terrorist plot rolling'?

36:42.400 --> 36:45.142
It would seem that there's a
chance that the Puppeteer...

36:45.236 --> 36:47.807
...is a hacker sent by some
government agency or other.

36:49.941 --> 36:53.821
The skill with which Ka Rum's death
was covered up has been nagging at me.

36:54.145 --> 36:58.093
As I tried to find some answers, I heard rumors
of a rather suspicious conversation...

36:58.182 --> 37:02.494
...that took place between the Prime Minister
and the Foreign Affairs Ministry not long ago.

37:03.187 --> 37:06.293
So you think that the Foreign Ministry
used a hacker to assassinate Ka Rum,

37:06.390 --> 37:08.836
the man who was such a big thorn
in the government's side'?

37:09.460 --> 37:11.201
To be perfectly blunt
about it, yet.

37:11.529 --> 37:15.170
In that case, we should probably
think of the abductions as a decoy.

37:16.133 --> 37:18.443
Which Section was it
that took the job'?

37:19.737 --> 37:23.241
While this incident does amount
to a serious international crime,

37:23.674 --> 37:28.987
if we consider only the results it has achieved,
we and the government are on the same page.

37:30.047 --> 37:35.998
For now, I believe we should let sleeping
dogs lie and avoid worsening the situation.

37:38.723 --> 37:42.933
You are to identify the 16 children
as soon as possible, but it ends there.

37:43.261 --> 37:46.299
I'm temporarily pulling you off of the
investigation into the Puppeteer.

37:48.499 --> 37:49.773
That is all.

37:52.903 --> 37:53.973
Oh, man...

37:55.039 --> 37:58.987
All that work for nothing, and now we've
got an assload of loose ends to tie up.

38:00.444 --> 38:05.416
Well, the least we can do is track down
those kids' parents as soon as we can.

38:15.226 --> 38:18.673
I'm on my way there now.
Sorry I'm late.

38:47.825 --> 38:49.532
I need to
ask you something.

38:51.195 --> 38:52.299
Yes, what'?

38:52.396 --> 38:56.367
Who made you pull us off this case'?
The Treaty Review Department'?

38:57.735 --> 39:01.740
Oh, you mean that.
I cut a deal with Nakamura.

39:02.073 --> 39:04.610
In exchange for turning
a blind eye to their work,

39:04.709 --> 39:07.883
we were allowed to take possession
of the micro machine virus.

39:08.346 --> 39:09.689
And you're okay
with that'?

39:10.281 --> 39:13.353
If purging Ka Rum was so vital
to national interests,

39:13.684 --> 39:16.688
you should be offended that they
didn't ask us to do it.

39:17.321 --> 39:21.269
Otherwise, what was the point of expanding
Section 9 these past two years, old man'?

39:22.326 --> 39:24.636
She's never gonna come back,
not when we're like this.

39:27.331 --> 39:30.210
Do we regret not receiving
such an order, or do we rejoice'?

39:30.301 --> 39:35.216
The answer to that question will determine
what path we will walk down in the future.

39:36.507 --> 39:38.680
I completely understand
the point you're trying to make.

39:39.009 --> 39:43.981
But we also must consider the possibility
that the Major will never return to Section 9.

39:44.281 --> 39:47.751
Her talents were even
rarer than ESP.

39:47.885 --> 39:51.196
Unfortunate though it may be,
no one can fill her shoes but her.

39:53.057 --> 39:56.800
I myself won't be able
to stay here forever.

39:57.094 --> 40:01.099
In which case, instead of solving one case
at a time using every ounce of our strength,

40:01.432 --> 40:05.744
shouldn't we create an organization capable
of tackling three at once using only 80%'?

40:05.836 --> 40:11.309
Don't you think that's the best way for it to
carry on our ideals even after we're gone'?

40:12.243 --> 40:15.884
That's what I had in mind as I worked
to expand our organization.

40:16.580 --> 40:19.322
Making Togusa the squad commander
was part of that larger plan.

40:19.950 --> 40:25.525
If you had accepted the job, though,
things might have worked out differently.

40:26.424 --> 40:28.597
I'm not cut out for
positions like that.

40:29.226 --> 40:33.106
If you subjectively believe that to
be the case, perhaps you're right.

40:33.431 --> 40:35.377
But it's different
with Togusa.

40:35.699 --> 40:40.978
A man has to overcome a great many hurdles
for his innate talent to blossom.

40:42.339 --> 40:45.149
I want you to give him
the support he needs.

40:45.709 --> 40:50.351
You sure about that'?
Personally, I think he's doing a fine job.

40:50.981 --> 40:55.259
The Major’s say that he's keeping his personal
feelings out of the way of doing his job.

40:55.619 --> 40:57.690
Sounds like he's even told his family
about his work at Section 9,

40:57.788 --> 40:59.790
as well as the prosthetics
he got.

41:00.090 --> 41:03.765
But I doubt he had an easy time
of winning their understanding.

41:04.929 --> 41:08.103
That's something that I was never
able to do to the very end.

41:13.170 --> 41:15.480
I'm glad we were able
to talk like this again.

41:32.523 --> 41:34.366
<i>It doesn't look like I'll be able
to make it home again tonight.</i>

41:34.458 --> 41:38.235
It can't be helped. You're in a
position of responsibility now.

41:38.329 --> 41:41.037
<i>Yeah... So, have the kids
been behaving?</i>

41:41.131 --> 41:41.973
Yes.

41:42.099 --> 41:46.775
But ever since our girl declared that she'd be
sleeping by herself in her own room last week,

41:47.371 --> 41:50.250
it's been a little quiet around here
without those two fighting.

41:50.341 --> 41:52.844
She has, huh'?
She's growing up.

41:53.077 --> 41:55.353
<i>She sure is. After all,
she's six now.</i>

41:56.213 --> 41:57.351
<i>Wow, she's six already...</i>

42:02.186 --> 42:04.097
Send me a picture of
her sleeping, okay'?

42:04.355 --> 42:05.766
<i>Sure. Will do.</i>

42:18.035 --> 42:22.177
<i>Togusa, we have an emergency!
Gel to Fla! 47 right away!</i>

42:27.511 --> 42:28.785
What happened'?!

42:32.983 --> 42:37.227
I'm sorry, sir...
The children are--

42:38.222 --> 42:39.826
They were gone by the time
we realized what was up.

42:40.658 --> 42:42.228
It's just like what happened
with Ka Gael...

42:42.426 --> 42:43.871
Sure looks that way.

42:45.195 --> 42:46.367
The Puppeteer...

42:53.504 --> 42:56.280
If he wanted Proto dead, he would've made
him pull the trigger a long time ago.

42:56.540 --> 42:57.678
He's just trying
to buy time!

43:01.078 --> 43:01.920
Shit!

43:02.580 --> 43:06.619
lshikawa! Borma!
Use the lR-System to find those kids ASAP!

43:06.850 --> 43:08.989
We're barely able to keep the
damn lights on right now!

43:09.086 --> 43:10.690
Let's ask the Prefectural Police
for assistance, too!

43:11.355 --> 43:12.800
Get Proto to the
analysis room.

43:15.926 --> 43:17.462
Togusa! We need
to talk!

43:18.062 --> 43:21.009
It can wait until later!
Finding those kids comes first!

43:21.632 --> 43:26.240
This is important! I think I might
know who the Puppeteer is.

43:36.880 --> 43:38.154
It's Aramaki.

43:39.883 --> 43:40.918
Pardon me.

43:41.619 --> 43:42.597
What kept you?

43:42.686 --> 43:45.189
Sorry, things are hectic
at work.

43:45.823 --> 43:48.997
How are you feeling,
Colonel Tonoda'?

43:58.502 --> 44:01.312
His little "hobbies" haven't
changed at all, I see.

44:01.939 --> 44:04.010
Don't be so hard
on him.

44:04.875 --> 44:08.084
They tell me that his health problems
are due to the stress of prison life.

44:09.813 --> 44:14.728
Where's that ingrate Tsujisaki'?
He hasn't come to see me even once.

44:15.119 --> 44:19.067
He's forgotten the debt he owes to the man
who looked out for him more than anyone else!

44:25.396 --> 44:27.672
His memories seem to be
a little jumbled, too.

44:28.432 --> 44:31.413
Let's step outside for a minute.
There's something I want to give you.

44:32.403 --> 44:36.146
There's nothing left now of the man
they called Colonel Red Demon.

44:37.141 --> 44:42.113
You should think about remarrying.
There's no sorrier sight than a single old man.

44:42.913 --> 44:47.623
I decided long ago that I'd never own anything
that I couldn't take to the grave with me.

44:47.918 --> 44:49.693
Steely-eyed and resolute
as ever, I see.

44:56.660 --> 44:59.800
So, what was it that you
wanted to give to me'?

45:00.130 --> 45:01.973
Right. This is it.

45:03.767 --> 45:07.715
The truth is, I ran into the Major
at Ma Shaba's hospital.

45:08.072 --> 45:10.074
The Major'?
You can't be saying that--

45:10.507 --> 45:13.078
At first, I didn't think
it was possible.

45:13.811 --> 45:18.123
But then, I became more and more convinced
that she <i>had</i> to be the Puppeteer.

45:18.782 --> 45:21.058
I missed my chance
to bring it up earlier.

45:21.885 --> 45:23.887
Did you see her kill
Ma Shaba'?

45:24.621 --> 45:28.364
No. But I did see her
walk off with the ampules.

45:32.329 --> 45:35.742
Earlier, I'd always butt in
whenever it seemed like...

45:35.833 --> 45:38.006
...the Major might be involved
in a given case.

45:38.869 --> 45:43.147
But back then, I always thought that she was
helping us solve the case in her own way.

45:43.874 --> 45:45.581
But this time
is different.

45:46.477 --> 45:49.515
What the hell is the Major
trying to do'?

45:50.280 --> 45:55.787
<i>Hell it I know. But it was the Treaty Review
Department that set up the hit on Ka Hum.</i>

45:56.320 --> 45:57.890
<i>That's probably where
the Major is.</i>

46:03.794 --> 46:04.898
<i>Batou!</i>

46:05.462 --> 46:09.103
<i>I want you and Saito to head
for beltway #16 immediately!</i>

46:09.533 --> 46:11.274
<i>This has top priority!</i>

46:12.069 --> 46:17.314
<i>Chief, we have a situation of our own here.
The Puppeteer has struck at Section .9, too.</i>

46:17.841 --> 46:18.945
<i>He's what?!</i>

46:19.042 --> 46:22.148
<i>Old man, I hate to say it,
but I think the Puppeteer is--</i>

46:22.646 --> 46:24.284
Let's keep this to ourselves
for now.

46:25.249 --> 46:27.024
I'll try to verify it
for myself.

46:27.885 --> 46:32.732
<i>Chief, now that he's made a move,
the investigation is open again, right?</i>

46:32.823 --> 46:34.097
<i>I suppose it is.</i>

46:34.191 --> 46:36.671
<i>Understood.
Now, what's happened on your end?</i>

46:37.461 --> 46:40.704
<i>About two hours ago, security cameras
in coastal district 2...</i>

46:40.831 --> 46:44.278
<i>...happened to catch sight oi an
internationally-wanted criminal.</i>

46:44.535 --> 46:50.076
<i>Huh? Who is he? He must be a tough
customer if you want me and Saito on it.</i>

46:52.276 --> 46:56.190
<i>A super-class-A sniper,
formerly of the Seok Republic.</i>

46:56.613 --> 46:58.354
<i>Lieutenant Raj Puhto.</i>

46:58.749 --> 47:00.990
<i>Raj Puhto? Wait, that was
one of the names from--</i>

47:05.455 --> 47:07.662
The one member who hadn't
come into the country, huh'?

47:09.059 --> 47:12.199
<i>He was the commander o!
Ka Rum's personal guard.</i>

47:13.096 --> 47:17.169
<i>The way! heard it, he'd sought asylum
in China after Seok fell...</i>

47:18.702 --> 47:22.172
<i>Considering the timing oi his entry into
the country, there must be something to this...</i>

47:22.606 --> 47:23.778
<i>Right.</i>

47:24.608 --> 47:27.646
<i>Fortunately, the Intelligence Bureau
has a fix on his current position.</i>

47:28.478 --> 47:31.049
<i>I want the two oi you to tail him
and find out what his objective is.</i>

47:31.515 --> 47:32.721
- <i>Roger:</i>
- <i>Roger:</i>

47:34.418 --> 47:39.697
Look, Togusa, if it turns out that the Major is
the Puppeteer and we have to take her on...

47:39.790 --> 47:42.794
I know, I don't want to
think about that, either.

47:43.393 --> 47:46.306
Somehow, some day,
I'll repay you for this favor.

47:48.799 --> 47:52.611
Col. Tonoda, I'm afraid I can't
stay any longer today.

48:01.378 --> 48:05.827
They say that children take after their parents
and robots take after humans,

48:06.783 --> 48:09.593
but you didn't turn out
anything like me.

48:10.787 --> 48:14.360
It makes me happy that a fool like me
produced a genius like you.

48:14.791 --> 48:17.328
Try to look after your health,
all right'?

48:20.564 --> 48:25.035
Thank you for saying so, sir.
Take care of yourself, too, Colonel.

48:40.484 --> 48:42.794
<i>What's his M. O. gonna be
for his sniping?</i>

48:43.287 --> 48:44.231
<i>The same as mine.</i>

48:44.321 --> 48:48.269
<i>He'll use his Haw/re ye to establish a
satellite link, and then take his shot.</i>

48:48.625 --> 48:52.801
<i>Which means its only a matte! of time before
we lose the ability to track him by GPS.</i>

48:53.830 --> 48:55.969
<i>Yeah, we have to catch him
before then.</i>

48:56.767 --> 48:59.475
<i>Lemme take oven
I'm gonna gel a look a! his face.</i>

48:59.569 --> 49:00.877
<i>Don'! let him spot you.</i>

49:25.562 --> 49:26.802
<i>I have confirmation.</i>

49:26.897 --> 49:29.173
<i>No doubt about it,
this is our guy.</i>

49:41.878 --> 49:45.758
<i>Togusa! The lR-System
has picked up one of the kids.</i>

49:46.216 --> 49:48.162
<i>Really?
What's his location?</i>

49:48.752 --> 49:51.892
<i>Walking through the grounds oi the
Kohoku public housing projects.</i>

49:52.556 --> 49:54.058
<i>Hey, that's near
where I live.</i>

49:54.624 --> 49:56.399
<i>Okay</i> I'll <i>go
check I! out.</i>

49:56.493 --> 49:58.336
<i>I'll put in a ca}!
to the PPD.</i>

49:59.229 --> 50:02.608
<i>I guess it's back to investigating those
20,000 abduction cases for us...</i>

50:02.699 --> 50:03.541
<i>Looks that way.</i>

50:04.101 --> 50:06.980
Damn, I guess we have to put the
Major on the backburner for now...

50:31.962 --> 50:34.442
Treaty Review Department
#6 Archive Room

50:44.307 --> 50:46.651
The Puppeteer,
I presume'?

50:48.645 --> 50:50.488
It's certainly
a fitting name.

50:51.214 --> 50:54.491
I received an inquiry a few minutes ago
from Public Security Section 9...

50:54.584 --> 50:58.191
masking me if I knew who a hacker
known as the Puppeteer might be.

50:58.955 --> 51:01.993
My answer was,
"Sorry, I don't."

51:03.193 --> 51:05.070
So, what did you want
to talk to me about'?

51:07.130 --> 51:09.235
I came here to refund
your payment.

51:13.503 --> 51:16.279
As far as we're concerned, as long
as you carry out your assignments,

51:16.373 --> 51:18.853
we don't care what you do
to get the job done.

51:20.243 --> 51:22.849
I'm sorry, but you won't
be seeing me again.

51:25.649 --> 51:30.894
In that case, I'll leave a net channel open
for you to contact us. Feel free to--

51:37.494 --> 51:39.132
This one's a puppet, too'?

51:40.730 --> 51:44.303
What a waste. And she was
so talented, too...

52:08.925 --> 52:10.563
The sun's about
to come up...

52:11.695 --> 52:15.074
Still, why do you think he
decided to come here <i>now?</i>

52:17.200 --> 52:19.544
You don't think it's to carry out
Ka Rum's revenge'?

52:20.070 --> 52:24.985
That would make the most sense, but how
would he have gotten his hands on that intel'?

52:25.542 --> 52:28.614
Even <i>we</i> were left out of the loop
on that little tidbit.

52:29.179 --> 52:30.385
You have a point.

52:31.281 --> 52:33.727
Geez, how much longer is this guy
gonna keep driving around town'?

52:38.555 --> 52:41.365
Come to think of it,
there's that building again.

52:46.730 --> 52:47.640
Hey, isn't that the--

53:08.451 --> 53:13.366
<i>Togusa, the kid just went into apartment
602 in building N25. Can you find it?</i>

53:13.890 --> 53:16.894
<i>Yeah, I know this neighborhood
like the back of my hand.</i>

54:23.927 --> 54:25.600
A Noble Rot
Senior Citizen...

54:42.212 --> 54:46.888
Give him back! Everything I have
is invested in that boy!

54:47.917 --> 54:52.798
I'd sooner will it to somebody off the damn
street than let the government take it!

54:53.790 --> 54:58.330
Anyway, the boy would've died of abuse
if I hadn't taken him in...

55:00.397 --> 55:05.005
That's the will of the people of all those
who live in the Solid State...

55:05.101 --> 55:09.516
It's our little game...
No, our just economic action!

55:10.140 --> 55:15.488
If you don't want to kill yourself like the others,
keep your nose out of our society!

55:16.379 --> 55:18.723
Consider yourself... warned...

55:31.728 --> 55:34.675
I'm definitely getting the feeling
that his sniping target is in there.

55:35.165 --> 55:36.143
Yeah...

55:57.454 --> 55:59.798
Turn off his cyberbrain and
assign a guard to him, okay'?

56:00.323 --> 56:01.324
Yes, sir.

56:08.331 --> 56:13.872
Cardiac arrest confirmed. Requesting disposal
of remains and retrieval of nursing system.

56:14.304 --> 56:18.684
Disposal'? That's strange, didn't he
have some family somewhere'?

56:19.609 --> 56:22.988
There's a six-year-old kid
listed in his file...

56:23.880 --> 56:25.587
Data error, maybe'?

56:25.715 --> 56:27.549
I shouldn't complain, that's
one less job for me to do...

56:27.550 --> 56:27.850
Sacred Citizen Relief Center I shouldn't
complain, that's one less job for me to do...

56:27.851 --> 56:30.457
Sacred Citizen Relief Center

56:30.820 --> 56:35.565
<i>Data error? No, he's missing
because I rescued him.</i>

56:36.025 --> 56:39.199
<i>Which means that even if I hadn't
come here, the boy would've been...</i>

56:39.329 --> 56:43.243
<i>taken into custody by them as par!
of their standard procedure.</i>

56:54.644 --> 56:57.181
<i>Special operatives
committing suicide...</i>

56:58.047 --> 56:59.492
<i>Vanished children...</i>

57:01.351 --> 57:02.796
<i>Noble Ho!
Senior Citizens...</i>

57:04.287 --> 57:07.461
<i>The will oi the people oi those
who live in the Solid State...</i>

57:08.992 --> 57:13.702
<i>Hang on, what does "Solid State"
mean in the first place?</i>

57:14.030 --> 57:16.203
<i>What did that
old man mean?</i>

57:24.441 --> 57:25.351
It's me.

57:25.675 --> 57:27.882
<i>Thank goodness,
I finally got through!</i>

57:28.311 --> 57:32.987
<i>Honey, you've got to come home at once!
Our daughter is missing!</i>

57:57.106 --> 57:58.312
That clinches it...

58:00.310 --> 58:01.254
Let's get after him!

58:02.679 --> 58:03.555
Wait!

58:04.113 --> 58:05.820
Shit, he's got
optical camouflage'?

58:14.757 --> 58:15.997
What the hell
is going on'?!

58:21.965 --> 58:23.137
Kiddie Security

58:23.333 --> 58:25.142
Her GPS is turned off...

58:25.468 --> 58:26.879
Is it the Puppeteer'?

58:27.370 --> 58:29.941
But she doesn't have any
cyber implants yet!

58:33.643 --> 58:36.123
I need you to pinpoint which
satellite he's using!

58:36.646 --> 58:40.150
Now that we've lost track of him,
the instant he starts to shoot is gonna be...

58:40.483 --> 58:42.156
...our first and last chance
to get him!

58:43.319 --> 58:45.094
I can probably find that
satellite for you,

58:45.188 --> 58:47.327
but how are you gonna actually
spot the guy'?

59:13.483 --> 59:14.689
He should be
in this zone...

59:15.118 --> 59:19.533
He'll know where we are, but we'll be able
to spot his position from up here.

59:19.622 --> 59:22.159
Change into this.
You're too easy to see.

59:22.625 --> 59:25.731
There's no time. If we can beat him to
the punch, I should be able to take him!

59:31.200 --> 59:32.304
Let's get started.

59:49.319 --> 59:50.127
Bingo!

59:50.253 --> 59:51.630
Send it to me!

59:56.159 --> 59:57.832
This guy's his target'?

59:59.128 --> 01:00:00.505
I've got a back-trace
on his position!

01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:01.870
SE-37...

01:00:09.238 --> 01:00:11.548
That's where he is'?
Send my data back at him!

01:00:17.714 --> 01:00:19.159
They're lining up
a shot on <i>me?!</i>

01:00:35.398 --> 01:00:36.376
Saito!

01:00:38.101 --> 01:00:39.171
Did I nail him'?

01:00:40.903 --> 01:00:42.814
Sit tight!
I'll go check!

01:01:02.358 --> 01:01:03.632
Damn it, hurry up!

01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:07.202
Huh'? Daddy'?

01:01:22.412 --> 01:01:23.390
<i>Well?</i>

01:01:25.982 --> 01:01:28.292
<i>Have a little faith in
you! skills, why don'! ya ?</i>

01:01:38.327 --> 01:01:39.101
That's a relief...

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:44.970
Now, then...

01:01:46.202 --> 01:01:51.276
Hey, who was that guy you were gunning for'?
Why were you trying to kill him'?

01:01:52.442 --> 01:01:58.415
It was to avenge the General's death...
I'm gonna kill every last one of you Japs.

01:01:58.514 --> 01:02:02.587
To get revenge'?
Don't give me that crap!

01:02:02.985 --> 01:02:05.488
Where'd you get your hands
on that piece of intel'?

01:02:06.055 --> 01:02:08.296
It was a tip that I got
from a double agent.

01:02:08.925 --> 01:02:14.102
He said he'd tell me who masterminded the
General's death, so I should go kill him.

01:02:14.530 --> 01:02:16.976
And what's the name of
this double agent'?

01:02:18.601 --> 01:02:23.050
An assemblyman named Munei who spends
a lot of time at the Foreign Ministry...

01:02:23.773 --> 01:02:26.982
<i>Old man, I need you to collar an
assemblyman by the name of Munei ASAP</i>

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:29.913
<i>Also, here's a picture oi the guy
that Haj was trying to kill.</i>

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.956
<i>Looks like he's the mastermind
behind the hit on Ka Hum.</i>

01:02:34.784 --> 01:02:38.926
If I'm not mistaken, the man in this picture is
the assemblyman named Hitoshi Munei...

01:02:41.891 --> 01:02:43.199
What're you trying
to pull'?

01:02:43.693 --> 01:02:48.608
The guy you were trying to whack
is the same guy who fed you your intel!

01:02:49.198 --> 01:02:50.370
That's his problem.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.571
Maybe he wanted to commit
suicide or something.

01:02:54.403 --> 01:02:55.905
Commit suicide'?

01:02:56.939 --> 01:03:01.945
Hey, are you sure the Puppeteer
isn't pulling your strings, pal'?

01:03:03.846 --> 01:03:06.190
Shit... Maybe it is.

01:03:07.283 --> 01:03:10.423
If that S.O.B. was human, I would've
killed it right off the bat...

01:03:10.953 --> 01:03:14.059
If it even got to me,
I'm gonna be so pissed...

01:03:14.557 --> 01:03:16.867
The Puppeteer isn't human'?

01:03:18.227 --> 01:03:22.698
It's the name of the mechanism for abducting
kids that's built into the Solid State...

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:24.911
The Solid State'?

01:03:25.802 --> 01:03:28.043
Hey! What the hell
is the Solid State'?

01:03:28.738 --> 01:03:32.345
You really don't know'?
It's the nursing net...

01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:38.555
The government of this democratic country
of yours goes around abducting children...

01:03:38.681 --> 01:03:39.989
It's too damn funny...

01:03:45.054 --> 01:03:47.660
<i>Old man, I need a paramedic team
and a chopper over here.</i>

01:03:48.858 --> 01:03:53.500
<i>And do some digging into this Munei guy's
background. Something fishy is going on.</i>

01:03:53.629 --> 01:03:54.767
<i>Understood.</i>

01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:02.049
So anyway, I found her
right after I called you.

01:04:02.939 --> 01:04:05.510
It sounds like she was with the
neighbors since this morning.

01:04:10.446 --> 01:04:14.121
She was, huh'?
Well, I'm just glad that it was a false alarm.

01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:18.025
<i>You shouldn't leave the house
without telling Mommy.</i>

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:19.292
<i>Okay!</i>

01:04:19.422 --> 01:04:21.493
<i>Good girl.
I'll drop her off at school.</i>

01:04:22.625 --> 01:04:24.332
<i>I'll have to go right back to
the office after that, though.</i>

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:27.300
Are you sure'?
You look exhausted.

01:04:27.797 --> 01:04:29.834
Just seeing you two
makes me feel better.

01:04:30.166 --> 01:04:32.976
<i>Really?
Well, if you say so.</i>

01:04:36.472 --> 01:04:37.678
See you later!

01:04:56.559 --> 01:04:57.799
What is it'?

01:04:59.228 --> 01:05:00.605
Nothing!

01:05:02.398 --> 01:05:03.672
<i>Togusa!</i>

01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:09.140
<i>We have Raj Puhto in custody. Looks like
the Puppeteer was involved in this one, too.</i>

01:05:09.772 --> 01:05:11.251
<i>Which means that
the Major is--</i>

01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:15.379
<i>Yeah. Bu? the Major might not be
the Puppeteer after all.</i>

01:05:17.013 --> 01:05:20.324
<i>Raj Puhto says that the Puppeteer is
the name of an abduction mechanism...</i>

01:05:20.449 --> 01:05:22.827
<i>...that's built into
the nursing net.</i>

01:05:23.319 --> 01:05:24.662
<i>Abduction mechanism?</i>

01:05:25.054 --> 01:05:26.294
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:05:26.422 --> 01:05:29.369
<i>Plus, he called the nursing net
the “Solid Stale,“</i>

01:05:29.492 --> 01:05:32.302
<i>and implied that the government
is involved somehow</i>

01:05:33.429 --> 01:05:37.969
<i>To tell you the truth, when I ran into the Major,
she told me to stay away from the Solid State.</i>

01:05:38.668 --> 01:05:41.274
<i>At first, I thought that "solid state”
was referring to cyber implants.</i>

01:05:41.704 --> 01:05:45.242
<i>In other words, she was telling me
to stay away from her.</i>

01:05:45.474 --> 01:05:48.887
<i>Bu? maybe she was actually telling me
to stay away from the nursing net.</i>

01:05:49.845 --> 01:05:52.587
<i>My guess is that Ka Rum and his group
uncovered this mechanism,</i>

01:05:52.682 --> 01:05:55.162
<i>tried to exploit it for their plot,
and got themselves purged.</i>

01:05:55.484 --> 01:05:56.690
<i>That makes sense...</i>

01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:02.796
<i>It's from Mommy.</i>

01:06:03.125 --> 01:06:04.365
<i>Give me a minute.</i>

01:06:09.131 --> 01:06:10.041
Hello'?

01:06:11.968 --> 01:06:13.845
<i>You ignored our warning.</i>

01:06:15.137 --> 01:06:15.842
Hey!

01:06:16.172 --> 01:06:18.743
<i>That mistake will cost you
your adorable little daughter:</i>

01:06:23.212 --> 01:06:24.748
<i>Togusa!
What's wrong?!</i>

01:06:32.722 --> 01:06:35.259
<i>lshikawa! Can you get me
Togusa S current location I?!</i>

01:06:37.059 --> 01:06:39.232
<i>I can look it up.
Why? What's up?</i>

01:06:39.595 --> 01:06:41.575
<i>His cyberbrain S
being hacked!</i>

01:06:47.336 --> 01:06:49.680
Daddy'? This isn't
the way to school...

01:06:53.909 --> 01:06:56.685
<i>Shit... So you're
the Puppeteer, huh?</i>

01:06:57.013 --> 01:06:59.857
<i>What's your plan, and how do
the abducted kids fit into it?</i>

01:07:00.449 --> 01:07:03.293
<i>Where did those 20,000
children disappear to?</i>

01:07:03.419 --> 01:07:09.301
<i>We are simply recycling Ghosts that have
been foolishly allowed to go to waste.</i>

01:07:09.792 --> 01:07:13.831
<i>I am about to let you experience for yourself
exactly what some of them went through.</i>

01:07:19.468 --> 01:07:21.669
Kohoku Cyberbrain Surgical Hospital

01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:22.410
Kohoku Cyberbrain Surgical Hospital
<i>Batou!</i>

01:07:23.105 --> 01:07:25.608
<i>I have a fl): on
Togusa</i> S <i>location!</i>

01:07:25.975 --> 01:07:29.252
<i>He's at the Cyberbrain Surgical Hospital
over in Kohoku New Town!</i>

01:07:39.688 --> 01:07:41.065
<i>Now I get it.</i>

01:07:41.724 --> 01:07:44.325
<i>Ii the kids' own parents
take them to the hospital,</i>

01:07:44.326 --> 01:07:48.069
<i>the doctors will perform the cyberization
surgery without suspecting a thing.</i>

01:07:49.965 --> 01:07:51.967
<i>Then you overwrite
the child's memory,</i>

01:07:52.301 --> 01:07:55.407
<i>the parent drops off their child with a
senior citizen, and the abduction is complete.</i>

01:07:56.005 --> 01:08:01.648
<i>After this, you'll wipe my own memory,
and my daughter will have vanished.</i>

01:08:05.147 --> 01:08:08.253
<i>You don't need to feel bad about
having your memories altered.</i>

01:08:08.784 --> 01:08:14.063
<i>In modem society memories are constantly
being altered on a subconscious level.</i>

01:08:14.457 --> 01:08:18.564
<i>The probability oi such alterations already
exceeds that of being in a traffic accident.</i>

01:08:34.676 --> 01:08:36.987
<i>So I'm being given
a choice, huh?</i>

01:08:53.162 --> 01:08:54.368
<i>That's the place?</i>

01:09:05.707 --> 01:09:08.746
<i>I'll never let you people
take my daughter.</i>

01:09:18.854 --> 01:09:22.801
Listen, honey. Do you think you can do
what Daddy's about to ask'?

01:09:23.893 --> 01:09:27.841
When Daddy lets go of your hand,
run away as fast as you can.

01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:29.466
R u n away?

01:09:29.798 --> 01:09:30.776
That's right.

01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:33.706
You're going to hear a bang,
just like field day at school.

01:09:34.069 --> 01:09:35.979
When you hear the bang,
run with all you've got.

01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:42.580
Once you start, don't stop running for anything.
And whatever you do, don't look back.

01:09:44.113 --> 01:09:45.490
Can you do that'?

01:09:47.448 --> 01:09:49.395
Okay, then.
Close your eyes.

01:09:54.223 --> 01:09:56.863
<i>I'm sorry...
This is goodbye, honey.</i>

01:10:11.574 --> 01:10:12.848
Togusa!

01:10:20.115 --> 01:10:21.287
I love you.

01:10:25.154 --> 01:10:26.030
Togusa!

01:10:53.916 --> 01:10:55.361
<i>Max! Musashi!</i>

01:10:58.487 --> 01:11:00.660
Everything's okay.
Don't worry.

01:11:08.597 --> 01:11:09.632
Major'?

01:11:10.599 --> 01:11:14.843
I had to wait until the very last second.
Sorry about that.

01:11:15.170 --> 01:11:17.650
So, I guess this means that you
aren't the Puppeteer...

01:11:18.574 --> 01:11:19.985
Where have you been
all this time'?

01:11:23.112 --> 01:11:24.090
Daddy!

01:11:27.483 --> 01:11:31.727
Ever since I left Section 9, I've been wandering
the net, secretly stepping in on my own...

01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:36.496
...to solve crimes that couldn't be dealt with
through organization-based methodology.

01:11:37.459 --> 01:11:40.065
In the course of doing that, I came
across these abduction cases,

01:11:40.396 --> 01:11:42.467
and have been conducting an independent
investigation of my own.

01:11:46.635 --> 01:11:49.013
I can't believe you
used Togusa as bait!

01:11:49.338 --> 01:11:51.909
Did you ever stop to think that you might
be putting his family in their crosshairs'?

01:11:52.007 --> 01:11:54.283
I made sure that I had safeguards
put in place.

01:11:54.810 --> 01:11:57.882
Thanks to those, we should now know who
the Puppeteer really is.

01:11:58.213 --> 01:12:02.992
What'? You mean "Puppeteer" isn't the name of
a system that's running on the nursing net'?

01:12:03.519 --> 01:12:06.796
Instead of calling it a "system," it would
probably be more accurate...

01:12:06.889 --> 01:12:10.632
...to call it a gestalt of all the senior citizens
who are attached to the nursing net.

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:15.502
But there's an independently-running
hub cyberbrain that manages the whole thing.

01:12:15.931 --> 01:12:17.171
A hub cyberbrain'?

01:12:25.174 --> 01:12:26.949
<i>Hey, are those what
I think they are?!</i>

01:12:28.677 --> 01:12:31.681
<i>I constructed them out o! data
I found drifting in the net.</i>

01:12:32.715 --> 01:12:35.059
<i>Hi, Mr. Baton!
Long time, no see!</i>

01:12:35.184 --> 01:12:37.186
<i>It's nice to see that
you're doing well!</i>

01:12:37.986 --> 01:12:42.366
<i>The nursing net has had a back door
installed in it eve! since its design stages.</i>

01:12:43.058 --> 01:12:44.036
<i>Look.</i>

01:12:46.562 --> 01:12:50.442
<i>This is the full view oi the rhizome that's
been woven by the senior citizens' gestalt.</i>

01:12:52.835 --> 01:12:55.076
<i>A rhizome doesn't contain
the concept of a "center "</i>

01:12:55.404 --> 01:12:57.611
<i>That's why the hub cyberbrain
is constantly in motion.</i>

01:12:57.706 --> 01:13:00.687
<i>That, or the rhizome itself
might be acting as the hub.</i>

01:13:05.948 --> 01:13:09.623
Okay, so now I know what's going on.
But who or what is the hub cyberbrain'?

01:13:10.619 --> 01:13:13.065
<i>Max! Musashi!
Report your findings.</i>

01:13:15.124 --> 01:13:16.102
<i>What's the problem?</i>

01:13:17.559 --> 01:13:21.507
<i>Um, I don't know how
to break this to you...</i>

01:13:21.997 --> 01:13:23.374
<i>You failed?</i>

01:13:26.201 --> 01:13:29.410
<i>B-But we did manage to
pinpoint its location, though!</i>

01:13:31.173 --> 01:13:32.516
Well, where is it'?

01:13:32.608 --> 01:13:37.785
<i>The Sacred Citizen Relief Center building!
That's where the heart of the nursing net is!</i>

01:13:58.066 --> 01:14:00.979
They've arrived.
Disengaging locks.

01:14:08.076 --> 01:14:09.987
It's been a long time,
Major.

01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:13.152
I suppose it has.

01:14:16.018 --> 01:14:18.521
It's too bad that this reunion wasn't
under happier circumstances.

01:14:22.191 --> 01:14:25.070
What made you decide
to come back'?

01:14:26.628 --> 01:14:29.108
Let's save that discussion
for later.

01:14:29.631 --> 01:14:32.339
Our first order of business right now
<i>is</i> to apprehend the Puppeteer.

01:14:35.370 --> 01:14:38.044
Hitoshi Munei. Assemblyman
in the Lower House.

01:14:38.474 --> 01:14:41.546
The reason why he was marked
for death is our sole lead...

01:14:41.643 --> 01:14:44.249
...in uncovering the true identity
of the Puppeteer.

01:14:44.847 --> 01:14:49.762
He's a reactionary conservative nationalist
who's always been a vocal supporter...

01:14:49.885 --> 01:14:53.992
...of the formation of a ruling class
comprised of pure-blooded Japanese.

01:14:55.023 --> 01:14:57.503
He's in constant contact
with the Foreign Ministry,

01:14:57.593 --> 01:15:00.164
and he also has strong ties to
the Treaty Review Department.

01:15:00.896 --> 01:15:03.274
He was also involved in
Ka Rum's assassination.

01:15:03.565 --> 01:15:04.669
What're you implying, Major'?

01:15:06.168 --> 01:15:09.047
I contracted out to the Treaty
Review Department so that I could...

01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:11.344
...make it look like Ka Rum
had been assassinated.

01:15:11.473 --> 01:15:14.181
But the Puppeteer got to him
before I could.

01:15:15.143 --> 01:15:18.147
So, you were only responsible for
covering up his death afterwards.

01:15:19.915 --> 01:15:21.588
Yes, more or less.

01:15:24.953 --> 01:15:28.924
We've also learned that Hitoshi Munei
has secured a leadership position...

01:15:29.024 --> 01:15:32.198
...in the day-to-day operations of
the Sacred Citizen Relief Center.

01:15:32.761 --> 01:15:34.104
What's in it
for him'?

01:15:34.696 --> 01:15:39.076
The place is just a relief center that provides
senior health care and vocational training.

01:15:39.601 --> 01:15:43.071
True. However, thanks to the
patronage of certain politicians,

01:15:43.171 --> 01:15:45.777
in addition to its public persona
as a tax-exempt foundation,

01:15:45.874 --> 01:15:50.254
it acts in reality as a training agency
for the power elite.

01:15:51.146 --> 01:15:53.285
So the place is a veritable
brainwashing factory...

01:15:54.149 --> 01:15:58.188
That must be what Raj Puhto meant when he
implied that the government was involved.

01:15:59.087 --> 01:16:03.866
If it's being used as a temporary central
clearing house for the abducted children,

01:16:04.192 --> 01:16:07.139
it means that the fact that Munei is using it
as a brainwashing factory...

01:16:07.229 --> 01:16:09.903
...is what the Puppeteer
has a problem with.

01:16:10.232 --> 01:16:13.543
Chief. How about conducting
a compulsory investigation'?

01:16:14.236 --> 01:16:17.149
Our top priority is to find
the missing children.

01:16:17.639 --> 01:16:19.983
Yeah, but raiding the place
will cause a scandal.

01:16:20.309 --> 01:16:24.780
If that happens, it won't just be a scumbag
of a politician that catches heat for it.

01:16:30.786 --> 01:16:32.663
<i>lshikawa!
How's it coming?</i>

01:16:33.722 --> 01:16:38.637
<i>The! you, Major? You picked a he}!
of a time to rejoin the fold...</i>

01:16:39.328 --> 01:16:42.605
<i>I found evidence of a massive amount
of equipment being brought in...</i>

01:16:42.698 --> 01:16:45.542
<i>...that was based of! o! the
HC-25 brainwashing machine,</i>

01:16:45.834 --> 01:16:48.110
<i>bu! {hats pretty flimsy evidence
as a basis to conduct! a raid.</i>

01:16:48.437 --> 01:16:49.882
<i>How about footage
from the inside?</i>

01:16:49.972 --> 01:16:52.612
<i>I only found footage from
their manual labor wing.</i>

01:16:53.809 --> 01:16:57.621
<i>The defense barrier protecting the education
wing is a complex virtual experience maze.</i>

01:16:57.746 --> 01:16:59.384
<i>I had no luck at all
sneaking in.</i>

01:17:00.515 --> 01:17:01.926
<i>Just looks like refugees...</i>

01:17:04.419 --> 01:17:07.195
So the abducted children are being
held in the education wing...

01:17:07.322 --> 01:17:08.995
Which means that the
abduction mechanism...

01:17:09.091 --> 01:17:12.300
...had already been built into this place
during its planning stages.

01:17:13.462 --> 01:17:16.170
If it weren't, I'd have a hard time imagining
that a rank-and-file politician...

01:17:16.298 --> 01:17:18.471
...would have the guts to propose
such an audacious policy.

01:17:19.768 --> 01:17:22.772
So you believe that the Puppeteer
was among those...

01:17:22.904 --> 01:17:25.384
...who were involved in laying
the project's groundwork?

01:17:27.676 --> 01:17:31.453
<i>lshikawa. Use decoys to make it look like
hackers are trying to dive the place.</i>

01:17:31.813 --> 01:17:32.883
<i>I'm going in.</i>

01:17:33.281 --> 01:17:35.989
If this blows up in our faces,
it'll give you guys some cover.

01:17:36.418 --> 01:17:39.399
If you and Togusa are still around,
Section 9 will be able to carry on.

01:17:39.488 --> 01:17:40.558
Batou.

01:17:41.857 --> 01:17:44.235
I don't like to hear
that kind of talk.

01:17:45.761 --> 01:17:48.173
Oh, so you're the one who's
going to retire this time'?

01:17:48.296 --> 01:17:53.575
I appreciate your consideration, but the only
reason I came here is to ID the Puppeteer.

01:17:54.136 --> 01:17:56.980
It's certainly true that you always need
someone who can get their hands dirty for you.

01:17:57.739 --> 01:18:00.913
And besides, I don't have anything
to lose right now.

01:18:03.145 --> 01:18:05.557
Chief. No offense, but I'm
going in there myself.

01:18:05.881 --> 01:18:08.623
The Puppeteer is waiting for
a chance to eliminate Munei.

01:18:09.351 --> 01:18:11.388
I don't want to let
this chance slip by.

01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:14.294
But how do you intend to go about
finding the Puppeteer'?

01:18:15.190 --> 01:18:17.892
We still don't have the foggiest idea
who he really is.

01:18:17.893 --> 01:18:18.234
We still don't have the foggiest idea
who he really is.

01:18:19.561 --> 01:18:21.097
I'm going to keep
my ears open.

01:18:23.031 --> 01:18:24.635
My Ghost will
whisper it to me.

01:18:37.946 --> 01:18:39.425
Gosh, this is
kinda awkward, huh'?

01:18:39.815 --> 01:18:40.793
Hup...--'

01:18:40.882 --> 01:18:41.986
Hup...--'

01:18:42.217 --> 01:18:43.093
Hup...--'

01:18:49.124 --> 01:18:51.400
Hi, everybody!
Been a long time, huh'?

01:18:59.501 --> 01:19:00.377
Here we go...

01:19:16.618 --> 01:19:17.756
Let's do it!

01:19:20.989 --> 01:19:25.335
There's nothing like the thrill you get from
zipping along in a physical body, is there'?

01:19:25.627 --> 01:19:28.801
Really'? I dunno, I'm not
used to my joints yet...

01:19:38.774 --> 01:19:41.618
This looks like another basic attack,
but their response seems strange...

01:19:42.444 --> 01:19:44.048
Go to alert status
just in case.

01:19:44.379 --> 01:19:45.881
- Understood.
- Understood.

01:19:50.185 --> 01:19:53.029
A fellow pro, huh'?
Oops!

01:19:55.624 --> 01:19:58.161
Okay, I guess we have
each other's attention...

01:20:07.969 --> 01:20:11.746
Hacking from the Public Prosecutors' Office
again, huh'? They're wasting their time.

01:20:23.018 --> 01:20:24.691
I'm going out to inspect
the facility.

01:20:33.829 --> 01:20:35.866
<i>Paz and Borma,
secure an evac route!</i>

01:20:35.997 --> 01:20:36.737
- <i>Roger:</i>
- <i>Roger:</i>

01:21:11.199 --> 01:21:12.644
W-Who are you people'?

01:21:12.868 --> 01:21:16.077
What good would that do you'?
Then I'd have to kill you.

01:21:27.449 --> 01:21:28.689
I've lost communications'?

01:21:37.692 --> 01:21:39.330
<i>Here come the
security cyborgs!</i>

01:21:41.563 --> 01:21:43.543
<i>Major, you go on ahead.</i>

01:21:55.477 --> 01:21:57.252
<i>The one who got inside
is as good as dead!</i>

01:21:57.679 --> 01:21:59.124
<i>Go after
the think-tanks!</i>

01:21:59.247 --> 01:22:00.351
<i>Got it.</i>

01:22:57.439 --> 01:22:59.214
Opening fire without so much
as a warning, huh'?

01:22:59.541 --> 01:23:02.078
This must be a key government
facility, all right...

01:23:25.467 --> 01:23:26.810
Wow, he's following us...

01:23:26.901 --> 01:23:27.811
That's fine with me.

01:23:54.963 --> 01:23:56.772
No thermal signatures
or shadows...

01:23:57.899 --> 01:24:00.436
Kyo-Fie's "Cloak of Invisibility," huh'?
Which means they're--

01:24:00.535 --> 01:24:01.980
Your intel's
way out of date!

01:24:12.447 --> 01:24:15.587
They don't call Type-3302
a cloak of invisibility.

01:24:15.817 --> 01:24:16.795
Son of a--

01:24:22.657 --> 01:24:25.069
Shit! You little--
Get off of--

01:25:19.647 --> 01:25:20.955
Mow 'em down.

01:25:21.282 --> 01:25:22.283
Roger!

01:25:40.068 --> 01:25:44.107
Back me up. I'll be able to gain control
of the system in a few more minutes.

01:25:44.372 --> 01:25:47.819
Leave it to me.
Haven't we always worked this way'?

01:25:59.554 --> 01:26:01.556
<i>Togusa! What's your
current position?!</i>

01:26:02.190 --> 01:26:05.763
<i>Major? I'm making my approach
up the wall of the building.</i>

01:26:06.528 --> 01:26:09.805
<i>Good. Make you! way to the roof
and rendezvous with the Chief!</i>

01:26:10.899 --> 01:26:12.901
<i>I've found out where
the children are.</i>

01:26:37.292 --> 01:26:38.270
Let's go!

01:27:11.259 --> 01:27:13.705
Assemblyman Munei.
We're Public Security Section 9.

01:27:13.828 --> 01:27:16.672
We've already seen for ourselves
what you're up to here.

01:27:19.367 --> 01:27:22.143
Judging from what we see here,
a large-scale compulsory investigation...

01:27:22.237 --> 01:27:24.239
...would seem to be unavoidable,
wouldn't it'?

01:27:26.374 --> 01:27:27.614
Public Security'?

01:27:27.942 --> 01:27:31.253
This facility might be off the books, but it's
the government's most vital agency.

01:27:31.379 --> 01:27:35.156
You self-righteous Public Security
pissants have no business here!

01:27:35.516 --> 01:27:40.022
Begging your pardon, Assemblyman,
but from what I can see here,

01:27:40.121 --> 01:27:44.536
this looks exactly like the sort of situation
that we have to intervene in.

01:27:44.993 --> 01:27:47.974
You're a public servant, but I
don't think you understand...

01:27:48.096 --> 01:27:50.975
...the gravity of the threat
that this country faces.

01:27:51.232 --> 01:27:53.610
If nothing is done, one day
in the not-too-distant future,

01:27:53.701 --> 01:27:56.841
our country's prosperity will
be supplanted by other races.

01:27:57.238 --> 01:28:01.584
To prevent that, we're expending tax revenues
on these children without families,

01:28:01.676 --> 01:28:04.748
providing them with an education,
and entrusting our future to them!

01:28:05.413 --> 01:28:08.087
Just what, exactly, do you
find wrong with that'?

01:28:08.182 --> 01:28:10.822
Those taxes are money that
you've exploited out of...

01:28:10.918 --> 01:28:14.127
...the elderly and the refugees
that you bind to this place!

01:28:14.222 --> 01:28:17.601
That couldn't be helped, either.
Stop and think about it.

01:28:17.692 --> 01:28:20.639
What have they ever done for
the good of this country'?

01:28:20.728 --> 01:28:24.699
They don't build families or have children!
They don't fulfill their duty as taxpayers!

01:28:24.799 --> 01:28:28.804
They live their lives only for themselves,
and then say, "I'm old, take care of me!"

01:28:28.903 --> 01:28:30.246
<i>Their selfishness
is appalling!</i>

01:28:30.972 --> 01:28:33.452
If I had my way, I'd put a new tax
on them to make up for...

01:28:33.541 --> 01:28:36.078
...the tax revenue we lose because they're
too old or can't work anymore!

01:28:36.744 --> 01:28:38.189
You're splitting hairs.

01:28:38.313 --> 01:28:42.090
In that case, perhaps you could tell me what
you politicians have been doing all this time'?

01:28:42.717 --> 01:28:45.823
Who will take responsibility for you placing
self-preservation and vanity above your duties,

01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:50.062
and constantly putting the pressing
problems at hand on the back burner'?

01:28:50.692 --> 01:28:53.764
I'm proud of the fact that I <i>have</i>
taken responsibility for it.

01:28:54.228 --> 01:28:58.233
Are you also proud of violating human rights
and cyberbrain ethics laws'?

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:02.072
I believe that those were steps
that had to be taken.

01:29:02.637 --> 01:29:04.207
You refuse to budge,
don't you'?

01:29:09.143 --> 01:29:11.589
<i>Major, I rah a check on the
number of children here.</i>

01:29:11.913 --> 01:29:15.588
<i>But it's nowhere near 20,000.
It's more like 3,000 at most.</i>

01:29:15.950 --> 01:29:18.123
<i>I see. Switch you! comm channel
to autistic mode.</i>

01:29:18.453 --> 01:29:19.397
<i>Roger.</i>

01:29:22.423 --> 01:29:23.493
Assemblyman.

01:29:23.591 --> 01:29:30.099
Were you aware that a system to automatically
abduct children was designed into this center'?

01:29:30.865 --> 01:29:35.439
These children aren't orphans. The vast
majority are children who were abducted.

01:29:36.371 --> 01:29:39.375
It was our investigation into those
abductions that led us here.

01:29:40.408 --> 01:29:43.480
You yourself are a material
witness in that case.

01:29:45.813 --> 01:29:48.692
I've overseen this project
from the very beginning,

01:29:48.816 --> 01:29:51.262
and I certainly don't recall incorporating
a bug like that into the system!

01:29:52.086 --> 01:29:55.397
In that case, we'll question the people
who came up with the system!

01:29:58.226 --> 01:29:59.830
It was me.

01:30:02.463 --> 01:30:05.876
I was the one who devised the core concepts
that the Solid State system is founded on.

01:30:31.692 --> 01:30:33.638
Togusa! Take everybody
into custody!

01:30:33.961 --> 01:30:34.939
Roger!

01:30:35.129 --> 01:30:38.906
Batou, I'm going to dive this guy's cyberbrain
before his memories pull a whiteout!

01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:40.278
Back me up!

01:30:41.002 --> 01:30:42.003
<i>I hope I'm in time!</i>

01:30:47.775 --> 01:30:49.186
<i>Batou, I'm connected.</i>

01:30:49.610 --> 01:30:51.453
Gotcha. I'm boosting
your signal.

01:30:55.216 --> 01:30:58.891
I see his memory field,
but the output is dropping.

01:30:59.253 --> 01:31:01.859
Batou, do you think you
can boost his output'?

01:31:02.290 --> 01:31:05.635
Let's try going in through a Tachikoma.
Come back up!

01:31:06.561 --> 01:31:07.972
There's no time!

01:31:08.663 --> 01:31:10.870
Can you see me,
Puppeteer'?

01:31:15.870 --> 01:31:18.316
<i>Can you see me,
Puppeteer?</i>

01:31:19.474 --> 01:31:21.385
<i>Puppeteer...</i>

01:31:21.809 --> 01:31:24.983
<i>That's the name oi the hub cyberbrain that
oversaw the Noble Hot Senior Citizens' rhizome.</i>

01:31:26.347 --> 01:31:27.451
<i>Yes...</i>

01:31:28.216 --> 01:31:30.287
I'm entering his
right visual center.

01:31:30.384 --> 01:31:32.990
Saccades have halted.
Fixational eye micromovements, too...

01:31:33.221 --> 01:31:34.393
Hey! What happened'?

01:31:38.526 --> 01:31:41.405
Batou, I'm patching him into
my speech center.

01:31:41.496 --> 01:31:44.464
- Don't be stupid! Come up, then dive again!
- I owe you a debt of gratitude.

01:31:44.465 --> 01:31:48.277
<i>Munei was the Solid State's
greatest bottleneck, you see.</i>

01:31:48.836 --> 01:31:51.112
<i>I've tried to purge him
time and time again,</i>

01:31:51.205 --> 01:31:55.017
<i>but he's an old-fashioned type who
hates the thought of cyberization.</i>

01:31:55.543 --> 01:32:00.549
<i>Who the hell are you? What are you
using the abducted children for?</i>

01:32:00.882 --> 01:32:02.725
<i>Setting aside the matter oi
my identity for the moment,</i>

01:32:02.817 --> 01:32:05.127
<i>perhaps my motives were
the same as Munei's.</i>

01:32:06.387 --> 01:32:10.836
This country has reached the point where
someone has to step in and take action.

01:32:12.994 --> 01:32:15.600
The problem of 6 million-plus
Noble Rot Senior Citizens...

01:32:15.930 --> 01:32:17.170
The growing
unemployment rate,

01:32:17.265 --> 01:32:20.439
and the proportionally decreasing worker
population that's continuing unabated.

01:32:22.136 --> 01:32:24.309
And then there is the
declining birth rate...

01:32:25.006 --> 01:32:27.282
There is no end to the problems
that must be addressed.

01:32:27.675 --> 01:32:31.646
Were you aware that even though there is such
a furor over the declining birth rate,

01:32:31.979 --> 01:32:37.622
50,000 children under the age of six
needlessly lose their lives every year'?

01:32:38.519 --> 01:32:42.331
30% of those deaths can be attributed
to domestic abuse.

01:32:42.423 --> 01:32:43.757
- Well'? Can you do it'?
- And in 80% of those cases...

01:32:43.758 --> 01:32:44.793
- I'll try.
- And in 80% of those cases...

01:32:44.892 --> 01:32:50.103
<i>...child guidance centers, the police, or other
relevant authorities were aware of the situation,</i>

01:32:50.197 --> 01:32:52.404
<i>but they were unable
to prevent the deaths.</i>

01:32:53.167 --> 01:32:55.647
<i>This country's systems
have already collapsed,</i>

01:32:55.770 --> 01:32:58.876
<i>and the potential oi the individual
is declining considerably.</i>

01:32:58.973 --> 01:33:00.008
<i>Major!</i>

01:33:01.042 --> 01:33:05.184
Stay in there much longer, and you're gonna
whiteout along with him when he dies!

01:33:05.479 --> 01:33:06.446
That's when...

01:33:06.447 --> 01:33:10.987
<i>...I came upon the idea oi recycling Ghosts
that were needlessly being damaged.</i>

01:33:11.552 --> 01:33:14.897
<i>I find at-risk children though
the abuse surveillance net,</i>

01:33:15.122 --> 01:33:17.159
<i>and then launder their
family registers.</i>

01:33:17.491 --> 01:33:20.665
<i>I thought that would give them
a new chance at life.</i>

01:33:21.429 --> 01:33:24.467
<i>So, that's the core concept
of the Solid State system?</i>

01:33:25.066 --> 01:33:26.704
<i>That's right. But to
make it work,</i>

01:33:26.801 --> 01:33:29.680
<i>the assistance oi the Noble Rot
Senior Citizens was essential.</i>

01:33:30.404 --> 01:33:34.784
<i>They hunger for something that
will give them a reason to exist.</i>

01:33:35.176 --> 01:33:37.486
<i>Although they wouldn't be able
to pass down their DNA,</i>

01:33:37.712 --> 01:33:41.421
<i>their posterity would exist on paper, and there
would be someone to bequeath their estate to.</i>

01:33:41.749 --> 01:33:44.821
<i>In this way, instead oi forfeiting their personal
property to the state upon their death,</i>

01:33:44.952 --> 01:33:48.195
<i>they could simply use the net and continue
to take part in this economic action.</i>

01:33:48.856 --> 01:33:51.302
<i>They happily gave my plan
their approval.</i>

01:33:51.993 --> 01:33:54.667
<i>You realize that what you're doing
is a crime, don't you?</i>

01:33:54.795 --> 01:34:00.006
<i>Yes, but ii those ends had absolute priority,
those were the only possible means.</i>

01:34:00.534 --> 01:34:05.677
<i>My main task was to save these children
who were in danger as soon as I could.</i>

01:34:06.307 --> 01:34:10.187
<i>For that reason alone, I have no regrets about
what I've done, even though it's cost me my life.</i>

01:34:10.678 --> 01:34:13.921
<i>On the contrary, it means that my
life as a bureaucrat had meaning.</i>

01:34:14.348 --> 01:34:17.761
<i>All that remained was to reinforce
the Solid State system...</i>

01:34:17.852 --> 01:34:20.389
<i>".10 make it into a
self-perpetuating mechanism.</i>

01:34:24.458 --> 01:34:29.066
Maybe, but by purging one by one
those who meddled with your system,

01:34:29.196 --> 01:34:31.437
...it drew attention to your plan,
and it was found out.

01:34:32.166 --> 01:34:35.079
Considering how they must have felt
when they knew that their time was near,

01:34:35.169 --> 01:34:37.240
it was an understandable reaction
on their part.

01:34:38.039 --> 01:34:41.577
Ka Rum I can understand,
but why Munei'?

01:34:42.109 --> 01:34:44.589
Because he held the
children prisoner here.

01:34:45.112 --> 01:34:48.184
If they simply ended up becoming
his brainwashed elite,

01:34:48.416 --> 01:34:51.192
my giving them a new lease on life
was all for nothing.

01:34:51.619 --> 01:34:54.293
Children need an education, but if you
don't release them out into the world,

01:34:54.388 --> 01:34:56.334
they won't develop a
strong will of their own.

01:34:56.657 --> 01:34:59.001
That was the point of contention
between Munei and me,

01:34:59.326 --> 01:35:02.739
and it was the main reason
why I had to eliminate him.

01:35:03.597 --> 01:35:06.806
But you people had to go
and show up this time...

01:35:07.468 --> 01:35:11.883
Regardless, my plan has now progressed
smoothly to its next phase.

01:35:13.441 --> 01:35:16.320
<i>I've never been able to
hack your cyberbrain,</i>

01:35:16.444 --> 01:35:19.425
<i>but now I've succeeded in getting you
to link me directly into it.</i>

01:35:19.547 --> 01:35:20.525
Major!

01:35:28.289 --> 01:35:30.826
<i>You killed yourself just to lure me
into linking with you?!</i>

01:35:31.158 --> 01:35:32.603
<i>You're a formidable opponent,</i>

01:35:32.927 --> 01:35:35.430
<i>but if I can momentarily trap you
in a though! maze,</i>

01:35:35.529 --> 01:35:37.975
<i>I should be able to eliminate
Section 9 all at once.</i>

01:35:42.136 --> 01:35:43.581
<i>I'm surprised.</i>

01:35:43.838 --> 01:35:46.409
<i>Your thinking is arrogant
and self-righteous,</i>

01:35:46.741 --> 01:35:49.813
<i>but you have so much drive that it's
a waste of your talent to be a bureaucrat.</i>

01:35:50.644 --> 01:35:55.889
<i>Plug you know all about me...
Who the hell are you?!</i>

01:35:57.218 --> 01:36:01.530
You still haven't figured it out'?
Come now, Motoko Kusanagi...

01:36:03.357 --> 01:36:07.100
Surely there can't be many
people in your memory...

01:36:07.428 --> 01:36:10.568
...who are burning with this much
egotistical righteousness.

01:36:30.417 --> 01:36:33.955
We've synchronized with countless
consciousnesses over the years.

01:36:34.288 --> 01:36:39.294
It shouldn't come as a huge surprise that your
deep collective subconscious came to life.

01:36:40.828 --> 01:36:43.468
With this, the Solid State
will be complete.

01:36:43.998 --> 01:36:46.842
And now, let's become
a vanishing mediator...

01:36:47.067 --> 01:36:49.809
...and go take an active hand in
the next society.

01:37:14.962 --> 01:37:18.432
I can't see anything.
Somebody give me a status report.

01:37:28.843 --> 01:37:30.413
Finally awake, huh'?

01:37:30.811 --> 01:37:33.690
Batou'? Are you there'?
What's happening'?

01:37:34.682 --> 01:37:35.990
Where am I'?

01:37:44.258 --> 01:37:47.705
So, what have they decided
to do with the children'?

01:37:48.495 --> 01:37:53.001
Well, it looks like they're going to be returned
to their real parents for the time being.

01:37:54.335 --> 01:37:58.841
Even with their memories overwritten,
even knowing about the abuse...

01:37:59.473 --> 01:38:02.010
I wonder if that's really
what's best for the kids.

01:38:02.977 --> 01:38:06.390
Perhaps the fact that they can't answer
that question after all this...

01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:09.188
...highlights the limitations
of our system.

01:38:10.818 --> 01:38:13.697
What'll happen to those kids who found
foster parents and managed to get out...

01:38:13.821 --> 01:38:16.700
...before their brainwashing
education could begin'?

01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:22.136
We'll probably have to wait a long time
for the verdicts of what I expect...

01:38:22.329 --> 01:38:26.971
...will be some rather complicated trials as
they go through them on a case-by-case basis.

01:38:29.970 --> 01:38:34.385
Chief, what can we even hope
to do about things like this'?

01:38:35.676 --> 01:38:37.713
The only thing I can
tell you is this:

01:38:37.811 --> 01:38:41.088
All we can do is continue to work
within the rules that govern us...

01:38:41.181 --> 01:38:44.526
...to make a stand against
the unjust.

01:38:49.590 --> 01:38:54.835
I only hope that when they're grown,
they've reached their full potential...

01:38:55.262 --> 01:38:59.802
...and will find the answers
that we weren't able to.

01:39:04.471 --> 01:39:10.353
When you think about it, the "Solid State
system" is a pretty ironic name.

01:39:11.545 --> 01:39:14.754
The guy's metaphor of choice was "transistors"
to describe the cyberbrains of senior citizens...

01:39:15.649 --> 01:39:18.994
That's definitely something that a stuffed-shirt
bureaucrat would come up with, isn't it'?

01:39:21.221 --> 01:39:25.033
I have to admit, I was a little freaked out
to learn who the Puppeteer really was.

01:39:31.332 --> 01:39:32.675
How do you mean'?

01:39:33.467 --> 01:39:37.938
We learned a few things after you
lost consciousness when he died.

01:39:39.039 --> 01:39:42.646
That pencil-pusher actually
died two years ago.

01:39:44.178 --> 01:39:47.648
Name, Tateaki Koshiki.
Age, 33.

01:39:48.182 --> 01:39:53.689
Born into a family of civil servants, and was
on the fast track to elite status since childhood.

01:39:54.355 --> 01:39:57.234
Joined the Ministry of Management and
Coordination right after graduating college.

01:39:58.092 --> 01:40:01.301
But he quickly grew frustrated and
began refusing to come to work,

01:40:01.395 --> 01:40:04.103
possibly because he had become a
civil servant with no sense of purpose.

01:40:04.431 --> 01:40:08.880
Due to his cyberbrain skills, he was allowed to
work from home via a remote prosthetic body...

01:40:09.470 --> 01:40:12.349
...and after that, he apparently carried out
his duties in an indifferent manner.

01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:16.119
Then, two years ago, Munei brought him onto
his project out of respect for his abilities,

01:40:16.210 --> 01:40:21.182
which would be carried out by manipulating
both the Welfare and Management Ministries.

01:40:21.782 --> 01:40:25.787
When he did, Koshiki independently designed
and implemented his abduction system.

01:40:27.354 --> 01:40:31.393
But his problem was, he wasn't
the kind of guy who stood out.

01:40:32.593 --> 01:40:34.595
In spite of this huge job
that he was working on,

01:40:34.995 --> 01:40:40.445
not one damn person noticed that he
had gotten sick and died at home.

01:40:43.837 --> 01:40:48.513
Thanks to that, the true identity of the Puppeteer
is gonna remain a mystery forever.

01:40:52.546 --> 01:40:54.992
So does that mean that
somebody else entirely...

01:40:55.315 --> 01:40:59.422
...was using that remote body
to cause all this'?

01:41:00.421 --> 01:41:01.695
It's possible.

01:41:02.890 --> 01:41:05.837
Actually, that theory is
probably more likely.

01:41:06.493 --> 01:41:09.269
Even with those old folks that
had formed a gestalt with him,

01:41:09.596 --> 01:41:13.669
their actions were caused by
their collective unconscious.

01:41:14.101 --> 01:41:17.514
So there's no way for us
to find out for sure now.

01:41:18.038 --> 01:41:18.846
Oh.

01:41:21.341 --> 01:41:22.945
<i>Except,</i> that is...

01:41:23.744 --> 01:41:28.193
...for the conversation between you and Koshiki
that was recorded in the Tachikoma's' memory.

01:41:31.819 --> 01:41:33.594
It's still in there'?

01:41:34.088 --> 01:41:38.867
It <i>should</i> be, but they claim
that when Koshiki died,

01:41:39.193 --> 01:41:42.436
...all of his memories
underwent a whiteout.

01:41:43.497 --> 01:41:45.807
Were you listening in on
that conversation, Batou'?

01:41:47.801 --> 01:41:48.973
Yeah, kinda.

01:41:50.604 --> 01:41:53.585
But at this point, it doesn't
really matter, does it'?

01:41:53.941 --> 01:41:57.980
The old-timers, those kids
who were being abused,

01:41:58.812 --> 01:42:01.224
all that stuff is on its way
toward being resolved now.

01:42:01.849 --> 01:42:07.231
Even if we didn't find out who the Puppeteer
really was, this case is still more or less closed.

01:42:08.355 --> 01:42:11.962
Written off as a scandal involving
a handful of bad-apple politicians'?

01:42:15.295 --> 01:42:16.672
It's the strangest thing,
Batou...

01:42:18.866 --> 01:42:21.938
What have I been feeling so jaded
and disillusioned about'?

01:42:24.605 --> 01:42:27.814
What do you think I was searching for
as I was wandering the net'?

01:42:28.542 --> 01:42:30.579
Truth'? Friendship'?

01:42:32.179 --> 01:42:34.489
Or maybe a certain
special someone'?

01:42:36.483 --> 01:42:39.327
Maybe I just wanted to blame this
organization or even the system...

01:42:39.419 --> 01:42:41.592
<i>...for my own sense
of helplessness.</i>

01:42:42.523 --> 01:42:45.527
What's gotten into you'?
You turning all meek and modest on me'?

01:42:46.627 --> 01:42:48.971
Did you get whatever it was
out of your system'?

01:42:52.166 --> 01:42:53.941
So, what're you
gonna do now'?

01:42:54.935 --> 01:42:58.678
You plan on keeping up that "conducting
investigations chosen by personal deduction"...

01:42:59.006 --> 01:43:00.917
...routine of yours
by yourself'?

01:43:01.975 --> 01:43:04.182
Maybe I've had my fill
of that, too.

01:43:05.345 --> 01:43:08.792
When I'm operating under restrictions,
I definitely feel constrained by them,

01:43:09.616 --> 01:43:13.223
but without those restraints, it doesn't feel
like my actions are accomplishing anything.

01:43:13.754 --> 01:43:15.825
I guess I'm right back
to where I started from...

01:43:16.557 --> 01:43:21.006
What's that supposed to mean'? That your way
of saying you're coming back to Section 9'?

01:43:21.962 --> 01:43:26.968
But what about Togusa'? Won't I
get in the way of his development'?

01:43:27.734 --> 01:43:31.204
If that keeps him from growing,
he wasn't gonna go any further anyway.

01:43:32.005 --> 01:43:33.712
I wouldn't sweat it
if I were you.

01:43:34.875 --> 01:43:36.081
Maybe you're right.

01:43:41.882 --> 01:43:46.262
You know, Batou, the net
truly is vast and infinite.

01:43:48.722 --> 01:43:54.195
Maybe a new society we've never even
dreamed of is already being born.

01:44:23.023 --> 01:44:31.101
