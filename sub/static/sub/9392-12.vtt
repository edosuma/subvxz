00:36.870 --> 00:38.037
(music stops)
Ow!

00:38.039 --> 00:40.439
There's a rock right there!

00:40.441 --> 00:42.875
There's a huge rock right there,

00:42.877 --> 00:43.976
and it's covered up by grass

00:43.978 --> 00:45.611
and there's no way
you can see it.

00:45.613 --> 00:46.845
And I got lucky.

00:46.847 --> 00:48.814
But someone else could
hurt themselves,

00:48.816 --> 00:51.984
and, and a small cut is a, is a
death sentence in these times,

00:51.986 --> 00:53.986
so let's just, you know,
let's...

00:53.988 --> 00:56.622
let's get these rocks out
of here.

A doggy.

01:30.925 --> 01:32.958
Kevin Smith 'cause he's too fat
to ride a plane!

Thanks, everybody.
See you next week.

01:48.843 --> 01:50.509
Yay! He's a good singer.

01:50.511 --> 01:52.010
Yeah, I've been catching
his library shows

01:52.012 --> 01:54.179
since there were only, like,
three or four kids here.

01:54.181 --> 01:55.781
You should have
been here, man.

01:55.783 --> 01:56.982
Those were the shows.

01:56.984 --> 01:58.951
Oh, looks like
somebody made a friend.

01:58.953 --> 02:01.019
I know.
Aren't they cute together?

02:01.021 --> 02:03.355
Adorable. I'm Lois.

02:03.357 --> 02:04.756
Hi, I'm Hope.

02:04.758 --> 02:07.626
Any relation
to Bob Hope? (laughs)

02:07.628 --> 02:08.760
I'm kidding!

02:08.762 --> 02:09.862
I'm kind of known
for having

02:09.864 --> 02:11.363
a twisted sense
of humor.

02:11.365 --> 02:13.365
Oh, don't worry,
I watch <i>Regis and Kelly.</i>

02:13.367 --> 02:14.666
I can handle it.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.268
Oh, so, you know.

02:16.270 --> 02:17.870
This is my husband Ben.

02:17.872 --> 02:19.138
Hi, glad to know you.

02:19.140 --> 02:20.873
Gosh, you know,
our little Scotty seems

02:20.875 --> 02:23.542
to be having such a good time
with your son.

02:23.544 --> 02:24.843
Would you be interested

02:24.845 --> 02:26.478
in getting them together
for a playdate?

02:26.480 --> 02:29.014
Oh, that sounds
like a wonderful idea.

02:29.016 --> 02:30.649
Look at them.
They're getting along

02:30.651 --> 02:32.751
like Billy Bob Thornton
and his cat.

02:32.753 --> 02:34.520
WOMAN:
Billy Bob?

02:34.522 --> 02:36.522
Leave me alone!
I'm taking a bath!

02:39.959 --> 02:41.860
Stewie, do you want
to be the Autobots

02:41.862 --> 02:43.162
or the Decepticons?

02:43.164 --> 02:44.796
What's with all
these labels, man?

02:44.798 --> 02:47.266
Autobots, Decepticons,
gay, straight--

02:47.268 --> 02:49.301
just pick a few robots,
and let's party.

02:49.303 --> 02:51.003
Hey, what's
going on in here?

02:51.005 --> 02:52.804
Oh, hello, Brian.
We're playing Transformers.

02:52.806 --> 02:54.540
Oh, cool.
Who's this little guy?

02:54.542 --> 02:56.341
It's my new friend, Scotty.

02:56.343 --> 02:57.876
Do you mind?
We're busy.
Oh.

02:57.878 --> 02:59.545
Hi, doggie.
play with us?

02:59.547 --> 03:00.979
Scotty, Scotty, it's fine.
It's fine.

03:00.981 --> 03:01.980
You don't have to.

03:01.982 --> 03:03.048
He doesn't know
Transformers.

03:03.050 --> 03:04.449
Yeah, actually,
I-I'd love to play.

03:04.451 --> 03:05.584
Wh-Who should I be?

03:05.586 --> 03:07.152
Should I be one
of these guys?

03:07.154 --> 03:09.288
I-I'll be this guy.
Who's this guy, huh?

03:09.290 --> 03:10.422
What's this guy's story?

03:10.424 --> 03:11.790
That's Optimus Prime.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.258
You can't be him.
Scotty's Optimus Prime.

03:13.260 --> 03:15.794
Oh, all right.
Well, I'll be,
I'll be this guy.

03:15.796 --> 03:17.296
How about this guy?
(growls)

03:17.298 --> 03:19.631
What was that?
Did you just growl?

03:19.633 --> 03:21.934
What robot growls?
That's Starscream.

03:21.936 --> 03:23.635
He's a Decepticon.
I'm the Decepticons.

03:23.637 --> 03:25.204
Look, why don't you
just beat it?

03:25.206 --> 03:26.972
All right,
all right, relax.

03:26.974 --> 03:28.941
I'll-I'll just, I'll be
this guy over here.

03:28.943 --> 03:30.976
That's He-Man.
We're playing
Transformers.

03:30.978 --> 03:33.345
Well, maybe this is the one
where He-Man visits.

03:33.347 --> 03:36.014
Brian, how is He-Man
supposed to get
to Cybertron?

03:36.016 --> 03:37.249
Hey, "Up, up,
and away," right?

03:37.251 --> 03:38.417
He-Man doesn't fly.

03:38.419 --> 03:40.485
Look, why are you being
such a dick about this?

03:40.487 --> 03:41.954
I'm just trying
to join in.

03:41.956 --> 03:43.855
Yeah, you don't know what
you're talking about, okay?

03:43.857 --> 03:44.923
You sound like...
That's not fair.

03:44.925 --> 03:46.291
I think I'm doing
pretty well.

03:46.293 --> 03:47.960
No, you don't know
the characters, Brian.

03:47.962 --> 03:50.429
If you could hear
yourself right now,

03:50.431 --> 03:51.763
you would not stop
throwing up.

03:51.765 --> 03:52.965
You can't just put He-Man

03:52.967 --> 03:53.999
in Transformers'
world, all right?

03:54.001 --> 03:56.168
He wouldn't be able
to get to Cybertron

03:56.170 --> 03:59.137
because he lives
in Eternia, and
Eternia is in

03:59.139 --> 04:00.505
an entirely
different dimension.

04:00.507 --> 04:02.608
He can just take
his rocket ship.

04:02.610 --> 04:05.711
Get... get out of here.

04:09.315 --> 04:12.751
TV ANNOUNCER:
We now return to <i>The Post</i>
<i>"Roe vs. Wade"Brady Bunch.</i>

04:12.753 --> 04:15.120
Greg! Marcia! Get down here!

04:15.122 --> 04:17.189
(barking playfully)

04:18.491 --> 04:20.926
Oh, you two are such a handful!

04:20.928 --> 04:22.894
(sitcom transition music plays)

04:27.934 --> 04:29.968
Oh, I'm getting
some steam.

04:29.970 --> 04:31.336
Picking up steam
here, Scotty.

04:31.338 --> 04:32.537
You'd better look out.

04:32.539 --> 04:34.206
I don't feel so well.

04:36.009 --> 04:39.211
Uh, kind of bad timing,
but gin.

04:39.213 --> 04:42.781
Hey, Lois, that
not-Stewie kid fell over!

04:42.783 --> 04:44.750
Oh, my God,
he's unconscious!

04:44.752 --> 04:45.984
Peter, what happened?!

04:45.986 --> 04:47.953
Eh, you know me, Lois,
I don't pry.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.421
Peter, he's not moving!

04:49.423 --> 04:51.123
We gotta get him
to the hospital!

04:51.125 --> 04:53.358
You got it, Lois!
To the Peter-rang!

04:56.129 --> 04:58.063
(laughter fades out)

04:59.866 --> 05:01.967
(laughter fades back in)

05:01.969 --> 05:03.802
(crashing)

05:03.804 --> 05:04.803
Just for the record,

05:04.805 --> 05:06.938
I was at the hospital
for a brief moment.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.777
Mrs. Griffin,
it's a good thing

05:11.779 --> 05:12.878
you brought this child in.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.313
Why? Is he okay?

05:14.315 --> 05:15.681
I'm afraid
he's very sick.

05:15.683 --> 05:18.016
In fact, his lab-work
shows he is suffering

05:18.018 --> 05:19.751
from Hodgkin's lymphoma.

05:19.753 --> 05:21.787
Oh, my God!

05:21.789 --> 05:23.422
Are you saying
Scotty has cancer?!

05:23.424 --> 05:25.457
I don't know, I didn't
read the whole Wikipedia entry,

05:25.459 --> 05:28.293
but the good news is that what
he has is highly treatable

05:28.295 --> 05:29.461
with radiation first,

05:29.463 --> 05:31.330
and if necessary,
chemotherapy.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.801
(coughs,
clears throat)

05:35.803 --> 05:36.935
Oh, for God's sake.

05:36.937 --> 05:38.637
Look, do you have
any idea

05:38.639 --> 05:39.938
how expensive
medical school is?

05:39.940 --> 05:41.273
No, I don't.

05:41.275 --> 05:43.175
Well, it's probably
pretty expensive.

05:43.177 --> 05:45.644
Lois! We came as soon
as we got your call.

05:45.646 --> 05:47.045
Oh, Hope, Ben,

05:47.047 --> 05:49.948
I'm so sorry to have
to tell you this,

05:49.950 --> 05:51.516
but Scotty has...

05:51.518 --> 05:52.784
Cancer. We know.

05:52.786 --> 05:53.985
You do?

05:53.987 --> 05:55.320
Yes, we're aware
of his condition.

05:55.322 --> 05:57.589
But you shouldn't have
brought him to the hospital

05:57.591 --> 05:58.957
without talking to us first.

05:58.959 --> 06:01.259
Why wouldn't we bring him?
He was unconscious.

06:01.261 --> 06:03.028
He clearly
needed treatment.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.630
Oh, no, he doesn't
receive treatment.

06:05.632 --> 06:06.498
What?!

06:06.500 --> 06:08.633
We're Christian Scientists.

06:08.635 --> 06:10.302
We don't accept medical care
for ourselves,

06:10.304 --> 06:12.003
and we don't permit it
for our children.

06:12.005 --> 06:13.338
But your son
has cancer!

06:13.340 --> 06:14.940
Wait a minute.
Christian Science.

06:14.942 --> 06:16.375
Is that, is that
that thing

06:16.377 --> 06:17.976
all them gaybo
Hollywood actors do

06:17.978 --> 06:20.345
to keep their stuff away
from other guys' butts?

06:20.347 --> 06:22.614
Don't you understand?
Scotty needs help.

06:22.616 --> 06:24.416
And he'll get it...
through faith.

06:24.418 --> 06:25.450
That's right.

06:25.452 --> 06:27.919
We will heal him
with the power of prayer.

06:29.288 --> 06:31.790
Y-You can't just let them
just walk out of here!

06:31.792 --> 06:33.425
Oh, I think
they'll be back.

06:33.427 --> 06:35.694
Are those their keys?
No, they're my keys.

06:41.501 --> 06:43.335
And they said because
of their faith,

06:43.337 --> 06:44.970
they don't believe
in medicine.

06:44.972 --> 06:47.272
Mom, I think there's
a lot of religions
that do that.

06:47.274 --> 06:50.041
Well, that may be, Meg,
but that poor little
baby has cancer,

06:50.043 --> 06:52.611
and they're just gonna
take him home and
pray over him?!

06:52.613 --> 06:53.945
Well, that's what they do.

06:53.947 --> 06:55.614
They believe that disease
is just an illusion.

06:55.616 --> 06:58.316
And the only way to fight it
is to make your faith stronger.

06:58.318 --> 07:00.986
Illusions?! You want to
talk about illusions?!

07:00.988 --> 07:03.088
If you die tomorrow,

07:03.090 --> 07:05.424
you think we're
gonna be devastated!
But you know what?!

07:05.426 --> 07:07.592
We're just gonna go out
and buy another dog!

07:07.594 --> 07:09.628
And maybe <i>this</i> dog
will fetch a stick

07:09.630 --> 07:11.797
and bring me my slippers
instead of prattling on

07:11.799 --> 07:13.832
about the pros and cons
of various religions!

07:13.834 --> 07:16.001
Chris, I think you've had
too much sugar cereal.

07:16.003 --> 07:18.170
I think I haven't had enough!

07:19.439 --> 07:21.673
Peter, I have to go talk
to the Jennings

07:21.675 --> 07:24.509
and ask them to reconsider
getting treatment for Scotty.

07:24.511 --> 07:26.011
I'm going with
you, Lois.

07:26.013 --> 07:28.980
All right, but try
to keep your mouth shut, okay?

07:28.982 --> 07:30.882
You have a habit
of saying the wrong thing.

07:31.818 --> 07:33.952
During his 22-year reign,

07:33.954 --> 07:36.822
this French monarch known
as "The Spider King" had

07:36.824 --> 07:40.358
an ongoing feud with Charles
the Bold, Duke of Burgundy.

07:40.360 --> 07:41.259
Peter?

07:41.261 --> 07:42.994
Who was King Louis XII?

07:42.996 --> 07:46.998
Ooh, I'm sorry, Peter, we were
looking for King Louis XI.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.100
Ah, damn it, I knew that!

07:49.102 --> 07:50.836
Ah, well, (bleep) me
in the (bleep)

07:50.838 --> 07:52.871
with a big,
black (bleep).

07:52.873 --> 07:54.973
King Louis XI.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.208
Tim, select.

07:57.877 --> 08:00.111
(doorbell rings)

08:01.147 --> 08:03.949
Oh, Lois, Peter,
come on in.

08:03.951 --> 08:06.117
We were just praying
for Scotty's recovery.

08:06.119 --> 08:07.819
If you'd like,
you can join us.

08:07.821 --> 08:10.088
Well, that's what we wanted
to talk to you about.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.290
You'd better not just have
church toys.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.993
Look, I don't mean to question
your religious beliefs,

08:14.995 --> 08:17.095
but as a mother,
I just can't bear the thought

08:17.097 --> 08:19.998
of little Scotty
not getting the help he needs.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.466
You really needn't worry, Lois.

08:21.468 --> 08:23.168
Scotty will get all
the help he needs.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.169
From where?

08:24.171 --> 08:25.804
From here.

08:25.806 --> 08:27.806
Science and Health with Key
to the Scriptures

08:27.808 --> 08:29.841
by Mary Baker Eddy?

08:29.843 --> 08:30.909
Let me see that.

08:32.879 --> 08:35.881
This is your god?! A woman?!

08:35.883 --> 08:37.883
Well, she's the founder
of our faith.

08:37.885 --> 08:40.418
Oh, really? So with this book
from the 1800s,

08:40.420 --> 08:43.455
you can pray away paralysis
or terminal illness?

08:43.457 --> 08:45.690
Yes, we would pray for
anyone who's afflicted.

08:45.692 --> 08:48.293
Well, then I'll tell you who you
should really be praying for.

08:48.295 --> 08:49.528
Out-of-work clowns.

09:00.006 --> 09:01.873
I need 40.

09:06.846 --> 09:08.380
Ben, Hope, please,

09:08.382 --> 09:11.283
I just want to do anything
I can to help your son.

09:11.285 --> 09:13.818
Well, you can, Lois.
Stay and pray with us.

09:13.820 --> 09:15.687
I think you'll find
that with God's love

09:15.689 --> 09:16.955
and a true belief,

09:16.957 --> 09:19.157
all manner of miracles
are possible.

09:19.159 --> 09:21.259
Look, I'm a churchgoer, too,

09:21.261 --> 09:23.862
but sometimes prayer
isn't enough.

09:23.864 --> 09:25.096
He needs professional
medical care.

09:25.098 --> 09:27.032
You know, Lois,
this couch would
be perfect

09:27.034 --> 09:29.167
for one of
your red wine
pass-outs.

09:29.169 --> 09:30.835
Look, we appreciate
your concern, Lois,

09:30.837 --> 09:32.270
but Scotty is our son,

09:32.272 --> 09:34.973
and we have to tend
to him as we see fit.

09:34.975 --> 09:37.876
But your son is sick!
He needs help!

09:37.878 --> 09:39.945
Um, does your god also not
believe in

09:39.947 --> 09:41.212
putting out snacks
for the guests?

09:41.214 --> 09:42.447
Come on, Lois.

09:42.449 --> 09:43.949
I think we're wasting
our time here.

09:43.951 --> 09:45.984
They're obviously very committed
to their beliefs.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.752
But their beliefs
are crazy, Brian.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.754
I don't know
who's crazier--

09:49.756 --> 09:51.923
these people or those
Seventh-Day Adventists.

09:51.925 --> 09:52.924
I'm a Methodist.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.693
We believe that
the Lord is our Savior,

09:54.695 --> 09:57.028
and we remember Him
by going to church

09:57.030 --> 09:58.597
and praising Him
every Sunday.

09:58.599 --> 09:59.965
I'm a Seventh-Day
Adventist.

09:59.967 --> 10:01.933
We believe all the same
things that you believe,

10:01.935 --> 10:03.768
but we go to church
on Saturdays.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.770
What...?!

10:05.772 --> 10:07.606
(laughing crazily)

10:07.608 --> 10:08.807
Ga-ga-ga-ga-gahh!

10:08.809 --> 10:09.808
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

10:09.810 --> 10:12.043
Hoo-hoo! Hoo-hoo!
Hoo-hoo! Hoo-hoo!

10:14.847 --> 10:16.448
I know it's
frustrating, Lois,

10:16.450 --> 10:18.483
but the fact is,
there are no laws that say

10:18.485 --> 10:20.919
those people have
to take their child
to the doctor.

10:20.921 --> 10:22.454
How can that be?

10:22.456 --> 10:25.023
Children are citizens, too.
They should have rights.

10:25.025 --> 10:27.525
Well, it's
a tricky area, Lois.

10:27.527 --> 10:29.794
You could file a suit,
but that could take months,

10:29.796 --> 10:31.596
and even then,
there's no guarantee

10:31.598 --> 10:33.298
the court wouldn't support
the parents' right

10:33.300 --> 10:34.599
to practice their religion.

10:34.601 --> 10:36.868
How could we live in
a country that would allow

10:36.870 --> 10:38.269
a sick child to die?

10:38.271 --> 10:40.839
Look, this country was founded
by people who came here

10:40.841 --> 10:42.507
to escape
religious persecution.

10:42.509 --> 10:44.809
They made sure we all had
a right to religious freedom,

10:44.811 --> 10:46.845
and it's my job
to protect that.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.780
So there's nothing
we can do?

10:48.782 --> 10:52.283
You could contribute
to the Policeman's Ball.

10:52.285 --> 10:55.487
What?!
What does that have
to do with a sick child?

10:55.489 --> 10:56.955
Look, it's
a nice night out,

10:56.957 --> 10:58.490
you're eating
at a fancy buffet,

10:58.492 --> 11:00.291
the captain does
his Al Pacino...

11:00.293 --> 11:02.761
Joe, we're really more
of a Fireman's Ball family.

11:02.763 --> 11:05.764
Oh, yeah?
Are the firemen gonna
come and put out the <i>rape?!</i>

11:05.766 --> 11:07.132
(sighs)

11:07.134 --> 11:08.867
Peter, we can't
let this happen.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.535
I-I mean, we're parents.

11:10.537 --> 11:12.337
What if this was
one of our kids?

11:12.339 --> 11:13.805
It's too bad we're
not the A-Team.

11:13.807 --> 11:16.007
'Cause then we could just go
in there and steal that kid.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.942
I don't know
about that, Peter.

11:17.944 --> 11:19.277
Kidnapping is
against the law.

11:19.279 --> 11:21.179
It's too bad we're
not Taken from <i>Taken.</i>

11:21.181 --> 11:23.181
Then I could dip my
head in brown paint

11:23.183 --> 11:25.417
and galumph around Europe
looking for my hot daughter.

11:25.419 --> 11:27.485
Although is it any worse
than what they're doing?

11:27.487 --> 11:28.853
They're letting a kid die.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.255
It's too bad we're
not Dragonheart.

11:30.257 --> 11:31.990
Then we could just fly
around on a dragon

11:31.992 --> 11:33.091
and forget
about all this.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.192
You know what?

11:34.194 --> 11:35.827
That's exactly
what we should do.

11:35.829 --> 11:37.929
What? What the hell are
you talking about?

11:37.931 --> 11:39.764
I'm talking about
us going in there

11:39.766 --> 11:42.000
and taking that kid
and getting him some help.

11:42.002 --> 11:43.301
I mean, I know it's wrong,

11:43.303 --> 11:44.936
but it's better than
just letting him die.

11:44.938 --> 11:46.371
Hey, that's not
a bad idea.

11:46.373 --> 11:47.939
It's like we're doing
a public service.

11:47.941 --> 11:50.341
Like those idiots who get
together to paint a school.

11:50.343 --> 11:53.111
This underachieving,
crime-ridden school

11:53.113 --> 11:54.879
is now fawn beige,

11:54.881 --> 11:57.849
thanks to guilty white people
with no weekend plans!

11:57.851 --> 12:00.018
OTHERS:
Yay!

12:04.090 --> 12:05.957
Peter, what the hell?

12:05.959 --> 12:06.925
Where's your ski mask?

12:06.927 --> 12:08.760
It's kind of hard to
breathe in those things,

12:08.762 --> 12:10.128
so I just dressed up
like Harry Potter.

12:10.130 --> 12:11.129
(sighs)

12:11.131 --> 12:12.163
All right, let's go.

12:12.165 --> 12:14.299
Lois, if anything
should happen to us,

12:14.301 --> 12:17.635
I want you to know, I haven't
been happy for a long time.

12:17.637 --> 12:20.438
Yes, Peter, you've
told me that, like, ten times.

12:24.710 --> 12:26.511
All right,
all the lights are out.

12:26.513 --> 12:27.545
They must be asleep.

12:27.547 --> 12:29.948
It's go time.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.119
Peter, what the
hell was that?

12:34.121 --> 12:35.487
That's what you do, Lois.

12:35.489 --> 12:36.855
Okay, now,
take this walkie-talkie

12:36.857 --> 12:38.857
and confirm that I'm at
the various checkpoints.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.925
Oh. Okay.

12:40.927 --> 12:43.461
"Peter up on a telephone pole"?

12:43.463 --> 12:44.496
Check.

12:44.498 --> 12:46.865
"Peter cutting the wires
to the alarm"?

12:46.867 --> 12:47.999
Check.

12:48.001 --> 12:49.167
"Sexy Peter

12:49.169 --> 12:50.935
distracting the guards"?

12:50.937 --> 12:52.303
Check.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.172
Hello, boys.

12:54.174 --> 12:56.508
Come up and have sex
with me some time.

12:56.510 --> 12:59.277
"Van full of Peters
who all have stern faces

12:59.279 --> 13:01.379
because they're about
to pull off a heist"?

13:01.381 --> 13:02.814
Check.

13:02.816 --> 13:06.017
"Upside-down Peter who isn't
revealed to be upside-down

13:06.019 --> 13:08.920
until the camera spins around
and shows that he is"?

13:09.922 --> 13:11.289
Check.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.625
"Peter in an open airplane door

13:13.627 --> 13:16.661
slapping other Peters on the
back as they parachute out"?

13:16.663 --> 13:19.030
Go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go!

13:19.032 --> 13:20.031
Check!

13:20.033 --> 13:22.100
"Super gymnastic Asian Peter

13:22.102 --> 13:25.170
contorted into a box that will
be delivered into the house"?

13:26.138 --> 13:27.639
<i>Hai!</i>

13:27.641 --> 13:29.040
"Peter who hasn't answered

13:29.042 --> 13:31.276
because something has gone
terribly wrong"?

13:31.278 --> 13:33.111
Peter? Peter, are you there?

13:35.648 --> 13:37.882
Now, let's go get that kid.

13:37.884 --> 13:39.818
Okay, he's in the
left upstairs bedroom.

13:39.820 --> 13:42.520
All right, you keep the car
going in case there's trouble.

13:47.026 --> 13:49.093
All right,
I got him, Lois.

13:49.095 --> 13:51.262
(quietly):
Peter, what the--
that's not Scotty!

13:51.264 --> 13:52.697
That's Ben!

13:52.699 --> 13:55.099
Oh. Well, you know, we ain't
known this family that long.

13:55.101 --> 13:56.768
I'm still learning
everybody's names.

13:56.770 --> 13:59.304
Damn it, put him back and
go get Scotty, the baby!

13:59.306 --> 14:02.040
Okay, so I'll go get the baby,
and while I'm doing that,

14:02.042 --> 14:04.909
maybe you do something
about that snatchy tone.

14:07.813 --> 14:09.447
Lois, is this the right one?!

14:09.449 --> 14:10.715
Shh! Peter!

14:10.717 --> 14:12.016
Yes. Now, come on.

14:14.987 --> 14:15.987
HOPE:
What was that?

14:15.989 --> 14:16.988
BEN:
I don't know.

14:16.990 --> 14:17.989
It came from
Scotty's room.

14:17.991 --> 14:19.390
(tires screech)

14:21.327 --> 14:22.961
All right, we did it!

14:22.963 --> 14:25.096
Yes! We got the kid
and the treasure.

14:25.098 --> 14:26.664
Peter, there's
no treasure.

14:28.133 --> 14:30.201
Oh, well, never mind, then.

14:38.010 --> 14:41.012
TV ANNOUNCER:
We now return to <i>One-Hour</i>
<i>Crime Show Where the Murderer</i>

14:41.014 --> 14:43.114
<i>is the Most Famous Person</i>
<i>in the Credits.</i>

14:43.116 --> 14:44.849
I think you're gonna want
to take a look at this.

14:44.851 --> 14:46.017
What do we got?

14:46.019 --> 14:47.752
Looks like somebody
had a rough night out.

14:47.754 --> 14:48.953
Boy, you can
say that again.

14:48.955 --> 14:50.488
Better get the
coroner down here.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.257
He's still got his watch
and his wallet.

14:52.259 --> 14:53.524
Guess that rules out robbery.

14:53.526 --> 14:55.460
Stabbed 17 times
in the chest;

14:55.462 --> 14:58.329
I'd say the murderer knew
the victim intimately.

15:01.300 --> 15:03.868
Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker
with some breaking news.

15:03.870 --> 15:06.337
A local kidnapping
has rocked Quahog tonight.

15:06.339 --> 15:08.006
"Rocked Quahog"? Really?

15:08.008 --> 15:09.507
The whole town is r--

15:09.509 --> 15:10.842
The family maybe... is rocked.

15:10.844 --> 15:12.777
But the whole--
All right, well, in any event,

15:12.779 --> 15:15.380
we now go live to Asian reporter
Tricia Takanawa.

15:15.382 --> 15:17.882
Let's see how much
she's "rocked" by all this.

15:17.884 --> 15:18.850
Tricia?

15:18.852 --> 15:22.120
Tom, I'm standing here
with Mayor Adam West,

15:22.122 --> 15:24.522
with the latest information
about the disappearance

15:24.524 --> 15:26.257
of young Scotty Jennings.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.092
What can you tell us,
Mr. Mayor?

15:28.094 --> 15:30.762
Please, Mr. Mayor
is my father.

15:30.764 --> 15:32.163
Call me John Mayor.

15:32.165 --> 15:34.832
Your body is a
wonderland, by the way.

15:34.834 --> 15:38.503
What is the city doing
to help rescue the missing boy?

15:38.505 --> 15:40.305
Well, we're looking
for this child

15:40.307 --> 15:43.975
using all the latest technology,
including the newest,

15:43.977 --> 15:46.477
most advanced
multimedia milk cartons.

15:46.479 --> 15:47.845
Help me!
I'm missing!

15:47.847 --> 15:49.047
Help!

15:49.049 --> 15:50.949
Why are you still
eating breakfast?!

15:50.951 --> 15:51.849
I'm kidnapped!

15:51.851 --> 15:53.952
Why are you turning me
the other way?!

15:53.954 --> 15:55.186
I'm still here!

15:55.188 --> 15:56.754
Scotty Jennings?

15:56.756 --> 15:58.189
Oh, my God!

15:58.191 --> 15:59.991
I know she was upset,
but do you think

15:59.993 --> 16:01.993
Lois would've gone
so far as to kidnap him?

16:01.995 --> 16:03.094
Of course she did.

16:03.096 --> 16:04.329
She'll do anything
for attention.

16:04.331 --> 16:05.463
I know.

16:05.465 --> 16:06.831
She's like the boy
who cried wolf.

16:06.833 --> 16:08.666
(sheep bleating)

16:08.668 --> 16:10.001
Wolf, wolf!

16:10.003 --> 16:11.169
Did you hear that?

16:11.171 --> 16:13.237
Somebody needs help!
Let's go!

16:15.441 --> 16:16.441
(screams)

16:16.443 --> 16:18.109
Oh, my God, Charles!

16:18.111 --> 16:19.844
Oh, my God,
I'll run and get help.

16:19.846 --> 16:21.512
No, no, we've got
to carry him!

16:21.514 --> 16:23.781
We can't leave him
here; there's a wolf!

16:23.783 --> 16:26.417
Um, there's not
really a wolf.

16:26.419 --> 16:27.518
What?!

16:27.520 --> 16:30.188
Tell my kids I love 'em.

16:30.190 --> 16:33.424
Charlie! Charlie!

16:33.426 --> 16:36.494
This was so funny in my head
when I planned it.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.264
Don't you worry, Scotty.

16:40.266 --> 16:41.933
We're gonna get you
to the hospital

16:41.935 --> 16:43.801
and get you the medical
attention you need.

16:43.803 --> 16:46.971
When this is over, we
can get some ice cream.

16:46.973 --> 16:49.107
Me and Lois can get
some ice cream, not you.

16:49.109 --> 16:50.875
They're gonna be sticking
needles in you everywhere.

16:50.877 --> 16:52.276
You know, Peter,
you were right,

16:52.278 --> 16:53.878
this is actually
kind of a rush.

16:53.880 --> 16:56.314
I mean, look at us,
we're like Thelma and Louise.

16:56.316 --> 16:58.983
Yeah, but we all know that
didn't end well for them.

16:58.985 --> 17:00.084
(sirens wailing)

17:00.086 --> 17:01.652
You know what?

17:01.654 --> 17:03.955
Let's just turn ourselves in.

17:03.957 --> 17:05.823
I got a great lawyer.

17:05.825 --> 17:08.192
And he says, worst case,
eight to 12 years.

17:08.194 --> 17:09.927
And when we get out,
we'll still have

17:09.929 --> 17:12.030
the rest of our
lives ahead of us.

17:18.370 --> 17:20.171
(women screaming)

17:20.173 --> 17:21.172
(crash)

17:21.174 --> 17:23.174
Good-bye, terrible women.

17:29.681 --> 17:31.249
Oh, my God!

17:33.118 --> 17:34.986
This is Tricia Takanawa.

17:34.988 --> 17:37.789
I am standing outside
Quahog Hospital,

17:37.791 --> 17:40.625
where accused kidnappers
Lois and Peter Griffin

17:40.627 --> 17:41.826
have just arrived.

17:41.828 --> 17:44.796
Also arriving is
my overprotective boyfriend,

17:44.798 --> 17:48.266
who is suspicious whenever I am
called into work at night,

17:48.268 --> 17:51.436
even though I've been a
reporter for years, Tyrone.

17:51.438 --> 17:54.038
I thought I told you
to mention my painting business.

17:56.975 --> 17:59.110
Lois, Peter, stop right there.

17:59.112 --> 18:00.645
You're under arrest
for kidnapping.

18:00.647 --> 18:02.180
I'm gonna have to ask you

18:02.182 --> 18:03.881
to hand over the baby
and surrender.

18:03.883 --> 18:05.983
Joe, please get out of our way.

18:05.985 --> 18:08.853
I promise, when this is over,
I'll gladly go to prison

18:08.855 --> 18:11.289
for the rest of my life,
but not until I bring

18:11.291 --> 18:13.324
this defenseless child
into the hospital

18:13.326 --> 18:15.193
to get him the treatment
he deserves.

18:15.195 --> 18:17.829
Uh, Joe, we would
like two tickets

18:17.831 --> 18:19.097
to the
Policeman's Ball.

18:19.099 --> 18:20.098
Too late!

18:20.100 --> 18:21.099
(tires screech)

18:21.101 --> 18:22.200
There they are!

18:22.202 --> 18:24.602
Lois, please!

18:24.604 --> 18:27.205
Stop what you're doing and
give Scotty back to us!

18:27.207 --> 18:28.773
I can't do that, Hope.

18:28.775 --> 18:31.342
But we've entrusted our
son into the Lord's hands.

18:31.344 --> 18:32.643
I know.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.879
And maybe that's why
he ended up in my hands.

18:34.881 --> 18:37.381
The Lord can't do everything,
you know.

18:37.383 --> 18:38.883
Blasphemy!
Heresy!

18:38.885 --> 18:40.017
Sodomy!

18:40.019 --> 18:41.586
(chuckles) Sorry, I don't even
know what's going on.

18:41.588 --> 18:42.587
How you doin'?

18:42.589 --> 18:43.955
Ben, Hope,

18:43.957 --> 18:45.790
I know you don't believe
in modern medicine,

18:45.792 --> 18:48.326
but you do believe
in the power of prayer.

18:48.328 --> 18:49.193
That's right.

18:49.195 --> 18:50.528
And through the years,

18:50.530 --> 18:52.330
when there was disease
or infection,

18:52.332 --> 18:55.199
people of good faith
would pray to God for a cure.

18:55.201 --> 18:56.834
Yes. It's what we do.

18:56.836 --> 19:00.037
Well, then isn't it possible
that penicillin, vaccines

19:00.039 --> 19:03.708
and antibiotics are all
actually answered prayers?

19:04.810 --> 19:06.477
And isn't it possible that

19:06.479 --> 19:08.346
the amazing men and women
of medicine

19:08.348 --> 19:10.014
who brought about these miracles

19:10.016 --> 19:13.484
could be the instruments
of God's answers to our prayers?

19:13.486 --> 19:14.585
It's good so far, Lois.

19:14.587 --> 19:16.621
Try to work a few laughs
in there if you can.

19:16.623 --> 19:18.289
Look, I believe
life is sacred.

19:18.291 --> 19:20.958
And I know you want Scotty
to live a full life.

19:20.960 --> 19:21.792
(laughs)

19:21.794 --> 19:23.361
And if that's
true, then I think

19:23.363 --> 19:24.829
it's wrong for
you to ignore

19:24.831 --> 19:26.998
what very well could
be the Lord's will.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.966
I mean, what's the
point in praying to God

19:28.968 --> 19:31.669
if you're just going to wipe
your butt with his answers?

19:32.971 --> 19:35.606
Hope, Ben,

19:35.608 --> 19:37.942
please let God
answer your prayers.

19:37.944 --> 19:40.011
Please let your son get help.

19:41.213 --> 19:43.648
Well, I guess through
the Lord's will,

19:43.650 --> 19:46.317
anything is possible.

19:46.319 --> 19:47.485
All right, Lois.

19:47.487 --> 19:49.153
Scotty can have
his treatment.

19:49.155 --> 19:50.855
Oh, thank you!

19:50.857 --> 19:53.591
Thank you,
and God bless you both!

19:53.593 --> 19:54.825
Hey, everybody!

19:54.827 --> 19:56.360
We're all gonna get laid!

19:56.362 --> 19:59.597
(wild cheering)

20:03.602 --> 20:07.038
TV ANNOUNCER:
We now return to
<i>Dracula in San Francisco.</i>

20:19.785 --> 20:20.785
Ooh.

20:20.787 --> 20:23.421
Well, that's why
we have the lab.

20:23.423 --> 20:25.523
Well, I just got off
the phone with Hope,

20:25.525 --> 20:28.092
and it sounds like Scotty's
gonna make a full recovery.

20:28.094 --> 20:29.527
You hear that, Stewie?

20:29.529 --> 20:31.195
Looks like your little
friend's gonna be okay.

20:31.197 --> 20:32.663
Eh, I don't care about him.

20:32.665 --> 20:34.498
I've got a new friend
who's got leprosy.

20:35.634 --> 20:37.201
(chuckles)
See, he's funny.

20:37.203 --> 20:39.337
Peter, are you actually reading
that Christian Science book?

20:39.339 --> 20:41.539
Yeah, you know, I figured
I'd give it a shot.

20:41.541 --> 20:43.507
I mean, wouldn't it
be cool if you could

20:43.509 --> 20:46.377
pray really hard for something,
and it actually happened?

20:48.880 --> 20:51.115
I am so happy for me.

20:51.117 --> 20:52.683
I deserve this.

20:52.685 --> 20:54.385
When do you think
the Queen's gonna die?
