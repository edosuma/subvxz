- It was the Marlings!

- A-- a-- a rabid fox.
- Rabif fox. It wasn't a fox!

It was part animal, part human.

The wolf was never caught,
but Hannah spent days out there

- trying to find it.
- That's why we locked you in.

wandering around in the woods.

They were trying to
get in my window.

That's weird.
Werewolves don't usually climb.

'Cause I was afraid
you wouldn't believe me.

03:50.026 --> 03:52.088
I guess they've always been around.

03:52.088 --> 03:53.898
They used to be able
to hide in the woods,

They've goota go someplace.

04:03.013 --> 04:05.876
That must be what my aunt
was talking about.

04:05.876 --> 04:08.838
She said they were working on
some kind of secret project.
