OH, GEEZ!

09:29.269 --> 09:31.002
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST
A LITTLE WEIRD

09:31.004 --> 09:33.238
TO BE DOING THIS
WITHOUT MY SECTION LEADER.

DID YOU DO THAT
ON PURPOSE?

CALL YOU "NORM."

I WANTED TO INTRODUCE HIM.

12:18.839 --> 12:20.105
OH, WELL, HE CAME IN AFTER
THE DEPARTMENT MEETING,

12:20.107 --> 12:21.172
BUT THEN HE LEFT.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.240
HE SAID HE NEEDED
TIME TO THINK.

JUST THE ONCE.

WAS JUST A FEW BLOCKS

THIS UNATTACHED ITEM MIGHT

14:09.316 --> 14:10.882
HAVE A CONNECTION
TO YOUR STUDIO.

14:10.884 --> 14:12.150
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?

14:12.152 --> 14:13.985
UH, IT PROBABLY FELL
OUT OF AN ENVELOPE

TO WHERE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO GO?

14:32.639 --> 14:33.637

COULD YOU TELL US
BILLY'S FULL NAME

14:37.978 --> 14:39.944

14:39.946 --> 14:42.213

HAD TOO MANY SYLLABLES

14:42.215 --> 14:44.115
TO SOUND LIKE
A SUCCESSFUL SONGWRITER,

14:44.117 --> 14:45.283

14:45.285 --> 14:47.485
AND HE CALLED HIMSELF
"BILLY JAMES,"

14:47.487 --> 14:49.654

IN EXCHANGE FOR STUDIO TIME.

14:49.656 --> 14:52.357

HEARD FROM HIM AGAIN,
