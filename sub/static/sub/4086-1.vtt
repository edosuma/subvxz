Juice by Tappy.

00:31.502 --> 00:32.753
Juice by Tappy.

00:33.045 --> 00:34.338
Juice by Tappy.

00:35.089 --> 00:37.050
That's got juice.

00:37.717 --> 00:39.552
Oh, Tappy.

00:43.264 --> 00:46.811
Juice by you.

00:47.978 --> 00:49.772
Juice by you. Thank you.

00:52.358 --> 00:55.821
We got a winner.
We got a winner.

00:56.029 --> 00:57.364
We got a winner.

00:57.572 --> 00:58.448
We got a winner.

00:59.866 --> 01:02.369
She's a flight attendant
from Washington, D.C.

01:02.619 --> 01:05.038
Will you please welcome
Mary Kellington.

01:05.206 --> 01:07.917
Juice by Mary!
Juice by Mary!

01:09.544 --> 01:13.673
- Harold, please, not again the TV.
- Come on, ma.

01:15.134 --> 01:17.261
Why make such a big deal of this?

01:17.469 --> 01:19.430
You'll get the set back
in a couple of hours.

01:22.141 --> 01:24.435
Why you gotta make me
feel so guilty, ma?

01:32.944 --> 01:34.028
What are you trying to do?

01:34.571 --> 01:36.323
Get me to break my mother's set?

01:36.741 --> 01:37.575
Or the radiator?

01:37.950 --> 01:39.618
Maybe blow up the house, ma?

01:39.869 --> 01:40.703
Is that it?

01:40.911 --> 01:42.747
Your own flesh and blood, ma?

01:42.955 --> 01:45.041
Is that what you trying to do?

01:47.461 --> 01:50.797
Why do you always play
games with my head?

01:51.089 --> 01:52.466
I wouldn't do that.

01:54.634 --> 01:58.055
The chain isn't for you.
It's for the robbers.

01:59.265 --> 02:00.683
Why won't you come out?

02:05.397 --> 02:08.233
See what I mean? See how
you always gotta upset me?

02:23.291 --> 02:24.417
Ma?

02:30.674 --> 02:32.802
C'mon out, please.

02:37.265 --> 02:38.809
Screw it!

02:39.518 --> 02:40.769
This isn't happening.

02:42.229 --> 02:45.274
And if it were, it
would be alright.

02:45.900 --> 02:49.821
Don't worry Seymour.
It'll all work out.

02:50.696 --> 02:54.534
You'll see.
In the end it's all nice.

03:00.040 --> 03:04.128
Shit, that mother fucker's
looking a little seedy, Jim.

03:04.712 --> 03:06.423
You particular all of a sudden?

03:06.714 --> 03:10.969
Mother fucker could grow a beard,
as long as we get our braid.

03:11.469 --> 03:13.138
Give me a hand, Tyrone.

03:22.148 --> 03:23.190
Hello.

03:23.399 --> 03:24.066
Hi.

05:29.204 --> 05:30.747
Fuck, the table too.

05:31.415 --> 05:34.252
What, you want me to
schlep it on my back?

05:34.627 --> 05:35.587
You got a friend.

05:35.879 --> 05:37.630
I ain't no lepers schlepper.

05:38.590 --> 05:39.841
Such a son. A goniff.

05:40.091 --> 05:42.719
Your mother needs you like
a moose needs a hat rack.

06:10.041 --> 06:13.962
Sheeit, that's some
boss scag baby.

06:15.005 --> 06:16.715
I mean dynamite.

06:17.007 --> 06:18.884
Oh, man, something else.

06:25.725 --> 06:26.601
Know what we need?

06:28.853 --> 06:30.688
Get us a piece of this Brody shit

06:31.231 --> 06:32.941
cut it up, and off it.

06:33.609 --> 06:35.277
We could double our money.

06:35.486 --> 06:36.862
We could buy a couple of pieces

06:37.029 --> 06:38.948
and get some whole
other shit going on.

06:39.865 --> 06:40.991
That would be righteous.

06:41.242 --> 06:44.704
In no time at all, we'd
get a pound of pure...

06:45.247 --> 06:46.706
straight from Sal the Geep.

06:46.957 --> 06:51.503
That's what I'm talking
about, baby, no hassles.

06:54.882 --> 06:55.800
How's it going?

06:56.092 --> 06:57.176
What's up?

06:57.385 --> 06:58.386
The usual?

06:58.678 --> 06:59.762
Yeah, sounds good.

07:34.301 --> 07:35.343
Anything else?

07:39.097 --> 07:39.764
Anything else?

07:40.891 --> 07:44.312
No. Nothing.
I'm alright.

07:52.862 --> 07:55.115
Good afternoon, Mrs. Goldfarb.

07:55.365 --> 07:56.867
Good afternoon, Mr. Rabinowitz.

07:57.159 --> 08:00.037
Although I'm not sure how good.
And you?

08:00.245 --> 08:01.330
What can I say?

08:01.622 --> 08:02.581
You want your TV?

08:02.790 --> 08:03.958
Yes, if you don't mind.

08:05.376 --> 08:09.547
Can I ask you a question?
You won't take it personal?

08:10.924 --> 08:12.884
How many years we know each other?

08:13.135 --> 08:14.512
Who's to count?

08:14.804 --> 08:16.847
Why don't you tell the police?

08:17.056 --> 08:20.184
They talk to Harry, he won't
be stealing no more the TV.

08:20.768 --> 08:22.436
I couldn't do that.

08:23.355 --> 08:26.650
Harold's my child.
He's all I have.

08:27.901 --> 08:29.653
Thank you, Mr. Rabinowitz.

08:31.530 --> 08:34.826
Join us in creating excellence.

08:36.994 --> 08:40.581
<i>More passion for living than</i>
<i>you've ever imagines.</i>

08:40.789 --> 08:43.168
<i>Be excited.</i>
<i>Be excited.</i>

08:43.626 --> 08:46.088
<i>Be excited.</i>
<i>Be excited.</i>

08:46.755 --> 08:49.383
<i>Be excited.</i>
<i>Be excited.</i>

08:49.758 --> 08:52.469
<i>Be excited.</i>
<i>Be excited.</i>

09:25.798 --> 09:26.883
Hello? Who is it?

09:45.361 --> 09:46.362
Now what?

10:10.680 --> 10:11.556
Hello?

10:11.848 --> 10:14.018
<i>Mrs. Sara Goldfarb?</i>

10:14.227 --> 10:15.228
Me. Speaking.

10:15.436 --> 10:17.897
<i>This is Lyle Russel</i>
<i>from Maylin and Block.</i>

10:18.105 --> 10:19.816
I'm not interested.

10:20.066 --> 10:21.651
<i>I'm not selling anything.</i>

10:22.151 --> 10:25.489
<i>I just want to offer you a</i>
<i>chance to be on television.</i>

10:25.697 --> 10:26.532
<i>Maylin and Block...</i>

10:26.740 --> 10:27.407
Television?

10:27.741 --> 10:30.994
<i>That's right, Mrs. Goldfarb.</i>
<i>Television. Congratulations.</i>

10:31.537 --> 10:32.956
I don't have any...

10:33.164 --> 10:34.374
<i>I'm not looking for money.</i>

10:34.582 --> 10:37.252
<i>I'm calling to tell you</i>
<i>you've already won.</i>

10:37.544 --> 10:39.087
<i>We discover contestants...</i>

10:39.295 --> 10:41.214
<i>America's favorite TV shows.</i>

10:41.464 --> 10:44.510
<i>You've been chosen from</i>
<i>a long list of contestants.</i>

10:45.678 --> 10:47.054
<i>Meaning you've already won.</i>

10:47.888 --> 10:49.515
<i>Yes, Mrs. Goldfarb.</i>

10:49.765 --> 10:53.019
I never thought I'd
be on television.

10:53.228 --> 10:55.272
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>You, on television.</i>

10:55.480 --> 10:57.774
<i>We'll send you all the</i>
<i>necessary information.</i>

10:58.275 --> 11:00.819
<i>Goodbye, congratulations</i>
<i>and take care.</i>

12:07.726 --> 12:12.065
<i>I don't get it. Why are you</i>
<i>so hard on your folks?</i>

12:12.941 --> 12:14.901
<i>They give you everything.</i>

12:15.151 --> 12:17.070
<i>They hook you up with</i>
<i>an apartment.</i>

12:17.570 --> 12:18.530
<i>With a croaker shrink.</i>

12:18.780 --> 12:20.907
<i>Which is great. It's just...</i>

12:22.451 --> 12:26.413
<i>money is never what I</i>
<i>really wanted from them.</i>

12:27.748 --> 12:29.625
<i>That's pretty much all I get.</i>

12:30.960 --> 12:32.462
<i>Why don't you get away from them?</i>

12:33.255 --> 12:34.798
<i>How am I going to do that?</i>

12:36.508 --> 12:39.386
What about your clothes?

12:39.845 --> 12:42.557
Your sketches are great.
Open up a store.

12:43.891 --> 12:45.309
I can't.

12:45.601 --> 12:46.727
Why not?

12:47.103 --> 12:49.147
When will I have time
to hang with you?

13:02.495 --> 13:05.290
Where's the party?

13:05.540 --> 13:07.250
You're going to jump
out the window.

13:18.512 --> 13:20.681
I got a great diet book.

15:12.847 --> 15:15.141
Thought I'd catch
a little sun today.

15:15.433 --> 15:17.476
Really? In a box you'll catch it.

15:18.436 --> 15:22.065
Relax and think how gorgeous
you'll be with new red hair.

15:23.317 --> 15:26.487
Today the hair, tomorrow the sun.

15:28.447 --> 15:30.282
Anybody want to waste some time?

15:35.413 --> 15:37.665
<i>Angel says we should do it now.</i>

15:38.082 --> 15:39.292
<i>I'll call Brody tomorrow.</i>

15:39.501 --> 15:40.376
<i>Who's Brody?</i>

15:40.585 --> 15:43.631
<i>My connection. He's</i>
<i>got unbelievable shit.</i>

15:43.881 --> 15:45.049
<i>Shit, righteous.</i>

15:45.508 --> 15:47.301
<i>We got this idea.</i>

15:47.551 --> 15:48.844
<i>What is it?</i>

15:49.094 --> 15:52.015
<i>We cut this stuff up</i>
<i>and double our money.</i>

15:52.265 --> 15:56.061
<i>Get a pound of pure and retire.</i>
<i>Know what that means?</i>

15:56.645 --> 16:00.565
<i>We get off hard knocks</i>
<i>and be on easy street.</i>

16:02.819 --> 16:04.237
What's the catch?

16:05.655 --> 16:07.990
That's red. I mean that's a red.

16:08.407 --> 16:11.954
It's not a red red,
but that's a red.

16:12.204 --> 16:12.913
Red?

16:13.080 --> 16:13.956
Yeah.

16:14.331 --> 16:15.666
You're telling me that's a red?

16:15.916 --> 16:17.084
I'm telling. It's red.

16:17.417 --> 16:21.548
Then what's orange?
I want to know what's orange.

16:25.844 --> 16:29.222
Well, it could be...

16:30.850 --> 16:33.394
it's a little orange too.

16:36.230 --> 16:38.023
You know something?

16:45.073 --> 16:48.952
I always thought you're the most
beautiful girl I've ever seen.

16:50.036 --> 16:51.372
Really?

16:56.252 --> 16:58.462
Ever since I first saw you.

16:59.839 --> 17:01.508
That's nice, Harry.

17:08.056 --> 17:10.017
That makes me feel good.

17:13.271 --> 17:16.357
Others told me that before...

17:17.108 --> 17:19.068
and it was meaningless.

17:26.160 --> 17:30.540
Why? Thought they were
pulling your leg?

17:31.750 --> 17:33.793
No, nothing like that.

17:35.128 --> 17:38.298
I don't know or even
care if they were.

17:39.466 --> 17:41.093
<i>From them it was...</i>

17:43.387 --> 17:44.931
meaningless.

17:45.348 --> 17:49.560
When you say it, I hear it.

17:53.398 --> 17:54.858
I really hear it.

18:01.533 --> 18:04.702
Someone like you could make
things alright for me.

18:06.162 --> 18:07.580
You think?

18:11.418 --> 18:12.586
What is it?

18:12.795 --> 18:14.964
Remember I told you
about the store?

18:15.881 --> 18:16.757
Yeah.

18:17.758 --> 18:22.222
I've been thinking.
I put together some numbers...

18:23.890 --> 18:25.767
and it's not impossible.

18:26.518 --> 18:30.773
You could and should do it.

18:31.148 --> 18:33.568
We could do it together.

18:40.909 --> 18:42.327
What do you think?

19:46.856 --> 19:48.358
Stop already.

19:49.526 --> 19:52.905
I felt better in a red
dress than a cheese Danish.

20:30.321 --> 20:32.198
Three things is all I
did to change my life.

20:32.407 --> 20:33.366
Three things.

20:33.575 --> 20:35.618
No red meat.

20:36.035 --> 20:38.329
Why do they stick in red meat?

20:38.580 --> 20:41.125
I ate red meat to the
point where I'd...

20:41.333 --> 20:44.503
eat it raw.
I loved my meat.

20:44.920 --> 20:49.049
You need to be passionate.
No red meat.

20:49.593 --> 20:52.554
No red meat for 30 days.

20:53.889 --> 20:56.725
Three things is all I
did to change my life.

21:08.321 --> 21:10.699
Ada told us. It's gorgeous.

21:10.949 --> 21:12.826
We'll make it a little
darker tomorrow.

21:13.118 --> 21:13.702
Why darker?

21:13.911 --> 21:15.120
To go with my red dress.

21:15.370 --> 21:16.830
Now it's looking like Madonna.

21:17.039 --> 21:18.290
This is not Madonna.

21:18.498 --> 21:21.461
Neither is this, but
I'm going on a diet.

21:21.794 --> 21:23.004
What diet are you on?

21:23.213 --> 21:24.255
Eggs and grapefruit.

21:24.505 --> 21:26.257
I was on that once. Lots of luck.

21:26.507 --> 21:27.383
It's not so bad.

21:27.592 --> 21:28.718
How long you been on it?

21:29.135 --> 21:29.762
All day.

21:30.012 --> 21:31.764
All day? It's one o'clock.

21:34.183 --> 21:35.184
I'm thinking thin.

21:35.476 --> 21:36.602
She's thinking thin.

21:37.061 --> 21:39.981
My Louise lost 50 lbs.
Just like that.

21:40.232 --> 21:40.732
Like that?

21:41.066 --> 21:41.900
Like what?

21:42.901 --> 21:44.611
Did you put her in a sweat box?

21:45.403 --> 21:49.325
She went to a doctor. With
pills, you don't want to eat.

21:49.909 --> 21:51.369
What's so good about that?

21:51.661 --> 21:52.495
I'm sitting here...

21:52.662 --> 21:55.122
not thinking about chopped
liver and pastrami on rye?

21:55.414 --> 21:58.459
You shouldn't talk like that
when someone's on a diet.

21:58.709 --> 22:00.379
Oh, big deal.

22:00.587 --> 22:01.922
I'll sneak more grapefruit.

22:04.091 --> 22:05.592
I'm thinking thin.

22:05.842 --> 22:06.927
The mailman.

22:08.303 --> 22:11.099
You have something
for Sara Goldfarb?

22:11.349 --> 22:12.725
I'm expecting something.

22:13.017 --> 22:16.020
Goldfarb... Goldfarb...
Sara Goldfarb.

22:16.396 --> 22:18.731
This is it? That's it.

22:19.275 --> 22:21.110
Wait, I got to get my stuff.

22:21.986 --> 22:26.073
Okay, spell out your name.

22:26.824 --> 22:29.828
S-a-r-a G-o-l-d-

22:30.036 --> 22:31.913
f-a-r-b.

22:32.205 --> 22:35.333
Dynamite? Dynamite.

22:37.794 --> 22:40.840
Alright, we're on our way.

22:42.341 --> 22:44.427
Says he got some real fine shit.

22:44.927 --> 22:46.304
Alright, man.

22:47.305 --> 22:48.431
Here we go.

22:49.016 --> 22:52.603
Let's do this right.

22:53.103 --> 22:55.063
Come on, naturally.

22:58.442 --> 22:59.736
Come on, hurry.

23:00.862 --> 23:02.780
I wonder when you'll hear?

23:07.368 --> 23:09.455
They'll send you to
Tavern on the Green...

23:09.788 --> 23:11.582
where they send all the stars.

23:11.832 --> 23:14.835
I'll have eggs and grapefruit
at Tavern on the Green.

23:15.169 --> 23:16.295
I hope they have some.

23:16.462 --> 23:17.671
Hurry up.

23:17.880 --> 23:18.882
Here we are.

23:19.090 --> 23:20.217
Listen.

24:35.173 --> 24:36.300
There it is.

24:40.054 --> 24:41.139
There it is, baby.

24:42.557 --> 24:43.474
Shit.

24:44.058 --> 24:45.602
Shall we try?

24:46.936 --> 24:48.271
Wait, Ty.

24:49.023 --> 24:53.027
This is our chance
to make it big.

24:54.028 --> 24:57.281
We play it right,
we can get a pound of pure...

24:58.992 --> 25:02.495
but if we get wasted,
we'll fuck it up.

25:03.872 --> 25:07.042
I ain't trying to jive you, jim.

25:09.003 --> 25:11.547
I don't want to run the
streets my whole life with...

25:11.756 --> 25:13.257
my nose runnin' down to my chin.

25:14.008 --> 25:17.553
But we should take a taste
so we know how much to cut.

25:18.764 --> 25:19.723
It's business.

25:22.851 --> 25:24.603
Fair enough.

25:31.361 --> 25:33.154
Sheet...

25:50.006 --> 25:52.384
Thank you.

25:52.592 --> 25:54.386
30 days is all it takes.

25:54.678 --> 25:57.556
Number two:
No refined sugar!

25:58.182 --> 26:00.101
Now sugar's everywhere.

26:00.309 --> 26:02.812
Even in bottled water.

26:03.688 --> 26:06.023
I was sick with sugar.

26:06.482 --> 26:09.736
It nurtured my spiraling brain
that I felt I was a loser.

26:10.070 --> 26:11.572
Juice by you.

26:11.863 --> 26:13.073
Juice by you.

26:14.283 --> 26:17.619
Rule 2 is no refined sugar.

26:17.953 --> 26:20.164
Don't even think about
sodas anymore.

26:20.498 --> 26:21.624
Sucking candies, very good, sir.

26:21.916 --> 26:23.668
Just stay away from that stuff.

26:25.295 --> 26:27.130
No refined sugar.

26:27.380 --> 26:29.592
For 30 days I'll eat right.

26:30.342 --> 26:31.218
I'll pick up my spirits.

26:32.761 --> 26:34.138
I am going to try.

26:36.932 --> 26:39.477
I found hope. And in that
hope, I found a way.

26:48.613 --> 26:49.739
Stop!

27:23.943 --> 27:24.944
Hello?

27:25.152 --> 27:26.278
Rosie?

27:26.487 --> 27:27.656
Yeah?

27:27.822 --> 27:28.657
Sara.

27:28.907 --> 27:29.866
Yeah?

27:30.033 --> 27:30.533
I need the number of that doctor.

27:33.203 --> 27:35.372
I don't understand why
you got to see him.

27:35.830 --> 27:38.417
Cut the son of a bitch loose
for Christ's sake.

27:38.668 --> 27:42.463
I don't want him telling my
parents I've stopped therapy.

27:43.422 --> 27:46.092
They're already pissed
off at me.

27:47.761 --> 27:49.805
I'm not going to sleep with him.

27:50.097 --> 27:52.432
I'm coming home after the concert.

27:54.393 --> 27:58.189
You're jealous!
Harry, jealous?

28:03.653 --> 28:06.364
You're stubborn, put
your arms around me.

28:09.159 --> 28:10.327
Stop that!

28:11.996 --> 28:14.456
I'll suck your eyeballs out.

28:15.583 --> 28:16.542
I'm disappointed...

28:19.129 --> 28:21.172
that you're indisposed.

28:23.508 --> 28:25.218
Is Anita out of town?

28:26.511 --> 28:27.805
Why do you ask?

28:28.347 --> 28:31.601
I was wondering if
she's "indisposed".

28:37.189 --> 28:39.902
No, she's fine, thank you.

28:40.569 --> 28:41.987
She's in Florida.

28:43.405 --> 28:44.823
Can I ask you something personal?

28:45.157 --> 28:46.199
Of course.

28:50.163 --> 28:50.997
Anything.

28:52.165 --> 28:53.917
You have something over here.

28:54.167 --> 28:55.877
There?

28:56.127 --> 28:57.421
A little bit lower.

28:57.713 --> 28:59.882
Don't worry. It's much better.

29:00.299 --> 29:01.342
Arnold.

29:04.470 --> 29:06.430
How are you, Mrs. Goldfarb?

29:07.097 --> 29:10.477
How am I? Enormous.
That's why I'm here.

29:10.685 --> 29:12.479
I've seen much worse.

29:12.896 --> 29:13.980
Thank you.

29:14.606 --> 29:16.149
How's your hearing and vision?

29:16.733 --> 29:18.194
I have both.

29:19.570 --> 29:21.656
The doctor will be
with you shortly.

29:29.706 --> 29:31.333
You're a little overweight.

29:31.667 --> 29:32.376
A little?

29:32.793 --> 29:34.920
I have 50 lbs. I'm
willing to donate.

29:35.128 --> 29:37.924
We can take care of
that, no problem.

30:29.397 --> 30:32.483
We're on the way, baby.

30:32.984 --> 30:36.112
It was great out there.
Everybody's thirsty.

30:36.864 --> 30:38.282
Come to me.

31:27.461 --> 31:29.046
Purple in the morning.

31:29.672 --> 31:33.425
Blue in the afternoon.
Orange in the evening.

31:35.511 --> 31:37.722
That's my three meals.

31:40.225 --> 31:41.476
And green at night.

31:42.227 --> 31:43.270
Just like that. 1, 2, 3, 4.

32:55.599 --> 32:56.976
Come back to bed, honey.

32:57.310 --> 33:00.063
Come on, got plenty
of time for that.

33:00.772 --> 33:04.150
I'm grooving with these
new mirrors I got.

33:25.423 --> 33:28.177
I told you, ma,
one day I'd make it.

33:29.095 --> 33:31.138
You don't have to make anything.

33:31.389 --> 33:32.932
You just have to love your momma.

33:37.437 --> 33:39.022
What are you doing, baby?

33:39.940 --> 33:41.066
Nothing.

33:44.528 --> 33:45.779
I was thinking about you...

33:48.574 --> 33:50.868
and about the nasty things
I'm about to do to ya.

33:52.036 --> 33:53.329
I'm going to get on you.

33:56.834 --> 33:58.377
You'll scare me to death.

33:58.544 --> 34:02.631
I won't scare you. I don't
want to scare nobody.

34:05.509 --> 34:08.679
All I want is a little
peace and happiness.

34:10.724 --> 34:16.397
You're the finest fox I
ever laid my eyes on.

34:20.025 --> 34:21.277
That's what I'll do.

34:22.862 --> 34:24.237
For my mother.

34:24.530 --> 34:26.324
I've been thinking about
getting something for her.

34:26.574 --> 34:29.161
Like a present, or something.

34:29.578 --> 34:32.956
But I didn't know what
I was going to get.

34:33.206 --> 34:33.956
And?

34:34.166 --> 34:37.253
I finally asked myself,
what's her fix?

34:39.339 --> 34:40.465
Television, right?

34:40.797 --> 34:43.092
If ever there's a TV
junkie, it's the old lady.

34:43.509 --> 34:46.722
I owe her a new set anyway
after...

34:46.931 --> 34:49.934
being schlepped around
to old Abe's.

34:50.643 --> 34:51.810
You really love her.

34:55.438 --> 34:57.233
I guess so.

35:01.029 --> 35:03.198
I just want her to be happy.

35:03.448 --> 35:04.616
Let's go get it.

35:08.037 --> 35:09.538
Let's push-off first.

35:13.209 --> 35:16.129
We shouldn't get going
till tonight.

36:27.625 --> 36:28.626
Number three...

36:28.959 --> 36:29.918
Three!

36:30.210 --> 36:33.631
This drives most people crazy.

36:38.887 --> 36:40.847
This... is... easy... so... far...

36:41.389 --> 36:43.516
Give yourself 30 days...

36:43.808 --> 36:49.106
I guarantee... it will...
change... your... life...

37:36.033 --> 37:37.535
I mean that is thin.

37:37.618 --> 37:39.537
She doesn't look
like the same person.

37:40.162 --> 37:42.373
I can almost zip the dress.

37:42.790 --> 37:44.292
I've almost got the zipper up.

37:44.542 --> 37:45.669
Sara, the mailman.

37:46.086 --> 37:48.422
When I see it,
I'll wave it all over.

37:49.631 --> 37:51.300
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

37:51.591 --> 37:52.801
What did he say?

37:53.010 --> 37:54.971
Don't worry, it'll come.

37:55.221 --> 37:56.389
He said it'll come.

37:56.848 --> 37:58.182
I once waited 2 months
for a package.

37:58.433 --> 37:59.350
Two months?

38:00.685 --> 38:01.853
It's Harry!

38:02.103 --> 38:02.895
Look who's here.

38:03.104 --> 38:04.063
Harry!

38:04.272 --> 38:07.359
Easy, you'll crush me,
for Christ's sake.

38:08.611 --> 38:09.987
Come inside.

38:10.321 --> 38:11.488
Hi, Harry.

38:14.868 --> 38:17.537
How are you, Harry?
You look so good.

38:17.787 --> 38:18.747
You want something to eat?

38:18.997 --> 38:20.081
No, ma.

38:20.332 --> 38:22.584
A little nosh or a piece of cake?

38:22.834 --> 38:24.754
I could go out and get some.

38:25.004 --> 38:29.091
I don't have anything in the
house, but Ada will have.

38:29.759 --> 38:30.968
You want something to eat?

38:31.260 --> 38:32.345
No, ma, nothing.

38:32.595 --> 38:35.307
Sit down. You make me dizzy,
for Christ's sake.

38:36.391 --> 38:37.934
Notice anything about me?

38:38.477 --> 38:39.936
Notice I'm slimmer?

38:40.729 --> 38:42.022
Yeah, I guess you are, mom.

38:42.314 --> 38:45.652
25 lbs. I lost.
Can you believe it?

38:46.069 --> 38:46.986
And that's only the beginning.

38:47.236 --> 38:51.532
I'm really happy for you.
But will you sit?

38:57.289 --> 38:59.458
Sorry I haven't been
around in a while.

38:59.792 --> 39:01.210
I've been real busy.

39:01.543 --> 39:04.088
You got a good job?
You're doing well?

39:04.506 --> 39:05.840
Yeah, real good.

39:06.091 --> 39:07.425
What kind of business?

39:07.842 --> 39:10.804
I'm sort of a distributor.

39:11.054 --> 39:12.180
For a big importer.

39:12.472 --> 39:15.434
I'm so happy for you.

39:15.726 --> 39:17.019
Mom, you're killing me.

39:17.311 --> 39:19.522
Have you been lifting weights?

39:20.064 --> 39:21.357
I knew you could do it.

39:21.607 --> 39:22.650
You were right.

39:22.942 --> 39:25.696
Maybe you'll meet a nice
girl and have a baby.

39:28.824 --> 39:29.866
I already met one.

39:31.660 --> 39:33.036
Don't go ape shit, alright?

39:33.287 --> 39:35.498
Who is she?
Who's her parents?

39:35.832 --> 39:36.916
You know her.

39:37.125 --> 39:38.876
Marion Silver. Remember?

39:39.252 --> 39:42.964
Oh, Silver, of course.
Manhattan Beach.

39:43.298 --> 39:46.093
He's got a house on the
esplanade. Garment business.

39:46.593 --> 39:48.470
He's real big in women's undies.

39:49.096 --> 39:51.890
And before you go bouncin'
all over again...

39:54.519 --> 39:58.189
I want to tell you
I got you a present.

39:59.190 --> 40:01.318
I don't want a present,
just have a baby.

40:02.193 --> 40:05.281
Will you let me tell
you what I got ya?

40:06.615 --> 40:09.452
You're something else today.

40:10.828 --> 40:12.580
Look, I know...

40:15.208 --> 40:16.168
well...

40:18.545 --> 40:20.547
I'm sorry for being such a bastard.

40:21.381 --> 40:22.591
I want to make it up.

40:23.216 --> 40:25.803
I know I can't change
anything that's happened.

40:26.054 --> 40:30.266
But I want you to know I
love you and I'm sorry.

40:34.355 --> 40:35.814
And I want you to be happy.

40:37.107 --> 40:38.984
So I got you a brand new TV set.

40:39.234 --> 40:40.778
It'll be delivered in a few days.

40:41.028 --> 40:42.529
It's from Macy's.

40:47.202 --> 40:51.539
Your father would be so happy
to see what you're doing for me.

40:56.379 --> 40:57.755
You see that, Seymour?

40:58.589 --> 41:00.466
See how good your son is?

41:01.592 --> 41:04.388
He knows what it's like for
his mother living all alone.

41:05.430 --> 41:07.140
No one to visit her...

41:18.987 --> 41:19.737
Hey, ma.

41:21.531 --> 41:22.490
You on uppers?

41:22.699 --> 41:23.366
What?

41:23.574 --> 41:25.160
You on uppers?

41:25.953 --> 41:27.329
You on diet pills?

41:27.621 --> 41:29.748
I'm going to a specialist.

41:30.082 --> 41:33.293
You're makin' a croaker for speed.

41:33.712 --> 41:35.630
I'm just going to a doctor.

41:36.006 --> 41:37.590
Does he give ya pills?

41:37.757 --> 41:39.217
Of course. He's a doctor.

41:39.426 --> 41:40.427
What kind of pills?

41:40.844 --> 41:43.305
A purple, blue, orange one...

41:43.596 --> 41:44.598
What's in them?

41:44.932 --> 41:48.185
I'm Sara Goldfarb,
not Albert Einstein.

41:48.477 --> 41:49.603
How should I know?

41:49.812 --> 41:50.980
The make you feel good...

41:51.314 --> 41:52.606
and give you pep?

41:52.898 --> 41:55.360
Well, a little.

41:55.610 --> 41:58.322
A little? I can hear you
grinding your teeth from here.

41:58.572 --> 41:59.781
That goes away at night.

41:59.990 --> 42:00.741
At night?

42:00.949 --> 42:02.075
With the green one.

42:02.284 --> 42:04.871
In 30 minutes I'm asleep.

42:05.371 --> 42:08.499
You gotta cut that stuff loose.

42:08.833 --> 42:10.251
It's no good.

42:10.543 --> 42:13.129
What? 25 lbs. I've lost.

42:13.463 --> 42:15.883
Do you want to be a dope fiend?

42:16.258 --> 42:19.386
Am I foaming at the mouth,
or something?

42:19.720 --> 42:20.596
He's a nice doctor.

42:20.804 --> 42:22.890
That croaker's no good.

42:23.182 --> 42:24.601
How come you know so much?

42:24.809 --> 42:27.020
How come you know more
than a doctor?

42:29.105 --> 42:31.066
Believe me, ma, I know.

42:33.819 --> 42:35.863
You'll get strung out.

42:36.364 --> 42:39.116
Come on, I almost
fit in my red dress.

42:39.659 --> 42:42.161
The one I wore to your
high school graduation...

42:42.870 --> 42:44.623
your father liked so much.

42:45.624 --> 42:48.418
I remember how he looked
at me in the red dress.

42:51.254 --> 42:52.589
What's the big deal?

42:56.386 --> 42:57.887
I'm going to wear...

42:59.430 --> 43:00.932
You don't know?

43:01.724 --> 43:06.230
I'm going to be on TV.
I got a call and application...

43:06.981 --> 43:09.191
Whose pullin' ya leg?

43:09.483 --> 43:13.947
I'm going to be a
TV contestant.

43:14.364 --> 43:16.491
I don't know when yet.

43:16.700 --> 43:19.077
You'll be so proud
when you see your mother...

43:19.327 --> 43:22.455
in her red dress
and golden shoes...

43:22.664 --> 43:24.250
What's the big deal?

43:24.458 --> 43:27.586
Those pills will kill
you before you get on.

43:27.837 --> 43:31.173
You drove up in a cab.

43:32.049 --> 43:33.969
Did you see who had the best seat?

43:35.095 --> 43:39.016
I'm somebody now.
Everybody likes me.

43:40.600 --> 43:45.481
Millions of people will
see me and like me.

43:46.733 --> 43:49.944
I'll tell them about
you and your father.

43:50.903 --> 43:54.450
How good he was to us.
Remember?

43:58.037 --> 43:59.997
It's a reason to
get up in the morning.

44:01.874 --> 44:05.879
A reason to lose weight,
to fit in the red dress.

44:07.964 --> 44:10.300
A reason to smile.

44:11.843 --> 44:14.430
It makes tomorrow alright.

44:18.225 --> 44:19.894
What have I got, Harry?

44:22.981 --> 44:26.401
Why should I make the
bed or wash the dishes?

44:26.693 --> 44:30.072
I do but, why should I?

44:31.573 --> 44:32.616
I'm alone.

44:34.285 --> 44:37.622
Your father's gone.
You're gone.

44:40.124 --> 44:43.837
I got no one to care for.

44:45.506 --> 44:47.341
What have I got, Harry?

44:52.721 --> 44:54.015
I'm lonely.

44:56.559 --> 44:58.144
I'm old.

44:59.104 --> 45:00.814
You got friends, ma.

45:01.064 --> 45:05.486
It's not the same.
They don't need me.

45:11.701 --> 45:13.787
I like the way I feel.

45:15.914 --> 45:18.667
I like thinking about
the red dress...

45:18.917 --> 45:22.337
and television... and
you and your father.

45:24.382 --> 45:27.760
When I get the sun, I smile.

45:34.143 --> 45:35.769
I'll come visit, ma.

45:37.438 --> 45:40.983
Now I'm straight, my business
is going good, I'll come.

45:41.608 --> 45:44.112
Me and Marion.
We'll come for dinner.

45:44.446 --> 45:48.450
You bring her. I'll make
you mushroom soup and a roast.

45:49.868 --> 45:53.164
That sounds great, ma.

45:53.956 --> 45:56.500
I'll call ahead of time.

45:56.751 --> 45:59.503
Okay. I'm glad.

46:01.380 --> 46:05.594
I'm glad you have a nice
girl and your own business.

46:12.769 --> 46:17.106
I got to go. I have
an appointment in a bit.

46:17.982 --> 46:19.233
But I'll be back.

46:19.442 --> 46:21.319
You still got your key?

46:21.527 --> 46:22.821
Yeah, I got it, ma.

46:25.449 --> 46:26.659
Goodbye, son.

47:05.535 --> 47:07.161
Brody say you coming up quick.

47:09.247 --> 47:10.498
Thanks, man.

47:13.460 --> 47:14.420
He says you're smart.

47:14.962 --> 47:17.006
You're loyal, and not a junkie.

47:21.218 --> 47:22.804
Brody wants to promote you.

47:23.596 --> 47:25.765
To give you more responsibility.
You interested?

47:26.558 --> 47:29.602
Yeah, yeah.

47:34.400 --> 47:36.986
Brody says you fuck him,
I'll kill you.

47:37.194 --> 47:37.820
I got that.

47:38.029 --> 47:39.280
Remember that.

47:42.993 --> 47:44.953
Shit, you got a white driver.

48:43.476 --> 48:44.852
I love you, Harry.

48:48.773 --> 48:50.566
You make me feel like a person.

48:53.487 --> 48:59.243
Like I'm me and beautiful.

49:01.203 --> 49:03.665
You are beautiful.

49:07.627 --> 49:11.006
The most beautiful
girl in the world.

49:12.967 --> 49:14.844
You're my dream.

49:21.434 --> 49:24.771
<i>No, Mrs. Goldfarb, I'm sure.</i>
<i>I've checked again.</i>

49:25.022 --> 49:27.858
Maybe you got me a weaker
one last time.

49:28.316 --> 49:29.776
<i>That isn't possible.</i>

49:29.985 --> 49:32.071
<i>They're all the same potency.</i>

49:32.280 --> 49:34.157
Something isn't the same.

49:34.365 --> 49:36.034
<i>You're becoming adjusted to them.</i>

49:36.242 --> 49:39.078
<i>It's nothing to worry</i>
<i>about, Mrs. Goldfarb.</i>

49:57.474 --> 49:58.808
We got a winner!

49:59.017 --> 49:59.809
We got a winner!

50:00.060 --> 50:01.269
We got a winner!

50:01.479 --> 50:04.857
A beautiful woman
with a magical smile.

50:05.232 --> 50:07.109
Straight from Brighton
Beach Brooklyn.

50:07.318 --> 50:10.404
Let's give a juicy welcome
to Mrs. Sara Goldfarb.

50:10.654 --> 50:12.532
Juice by Sara!

50:12.741 --> 50:15.827
Juice by Sara!
Juice by Sara!

50:16.161 --> 50:19.206
Juice by Sara!

50:30.968 --> 50:33.889
Tyrone C. Get your shit
together. You made bail.

50:34.431 --> 50:35.683
How much?

50:36.308 --> 50:39.311
Most of our cash.
You're up for consortin'.

50:39.603 --> 50:41.314
Shit, man.

50:41.731 --> 50:44.317
It's a war between
Italians and blacks.

50:44.901 --> 50:47.320
Sal is keeping the
shit down in Florida...

50:47.612 --> 50:49.531
until guys like Brody
are all knocked off.

50:49.739 --> 50:50.573
Sheeit.

50:51.242 --> 50:52.034
No one's got a thing.

50:52.451 --> 50:53.452
Except Big Tim.

50:53.744 --> 50:55.496
Shit, let's go see him.

50:56.080 --> 50:58.457
He ain't selling.
He only giving up fuzzies.

50:58.958 --> 51:00.042
What?

51:00.376 --> 51:02.754
He's hooked on the thing, man.

51:03.463 --> 51:04.965
I told him I'd give
him all he wants...

51:05.173 --> 51:06.425
but he ain't selling.

51:18.730 --> 51:19.522
<i>Number three!</i>

51:19.897 --> 51:21.191
<i>Number three!</i>

51:21.734 --> 51:25.070
<i>This drives most people crazy.</i>

51:25.738 --> 51:26.989
<i>You're not going to like it!</i>

51:27.364 --> 51:28.532
<i>This is easy so far.</i>

51:28.866 --> 51:31.161
<i>Give this up for 30 days...</i>

51:45.051 --> 51:46.343
You alright?

51:49.263 --> 51:51.266
Yeah. It was a bad dream.

51:53.185 --> 51:54.436
Want some water?

52:17.336 --> 52:18.379
Maybe we should dip now.

52:18.670 --> 52:20.882
Marion, I already told you.

52:23.385 --> 52:24.803
It's all we have.

52:25.136 --> 52:27.806
Tyrone is going to
score in the morning?

52:34.105 --> 52:37.358
I don't know.
It's a bitch out there.

52:39.652 --> 52:41.238
It'll be okay.

52:43.865 --> 52:45.450
It'll be okay, Harry.

52:50.832 --> 52:53.334
Yeah, I guess so.

53:01.176 --> 53:02.803
I love you, Harry.

53:42.221 --> 53:44.557
What's the problem?
The weight's fine.

53:45.349 --> 53:47.769
The weight's fine. I'm not.

53:48.978 --> 53:50.898
The refrigerator...

53:52.316 --> 53:53.358
Something wrong?

53:56.945 --> 53:58.447
Everything's...

54:02.786 --> 54:04.996
all mixed up...

54:05.538 --> 54:06.706
confused like.

54:06.915 --> 54:08.917
Don't worry, just get this filled.

54:09.125 --> 54:10.503
Make an appointment for a week.

54:20.931 --> 54:21.890
Well?

54:22.849 --> 54:24.518
Tyrone ain't found nothing yet.

54:27.437 --> 54:28.772
What are we going to do?

54:29.523 --> 54:30.817
I don't know.

54:31.317 --> 54:33.653
You have to do something here.

54:33.861 --> 54:35.905
It's your fault we don't
have something.

54:36.114 --> 54:37.281
What are you talking about?

54:38.032 --> 54:40.077
You were hot to
get off last night.

54:40.327 --> 54:41.578
That is bullshit!

54:41.829 --> 54:43.997
We could have had something.

54:44.206 --> 54:45.999
I'm going to sit around and...

54:46.208 --> 54:47.960
watch you push-off alone?

54:48.210 --> 54:50.004
Don't put it all on me.

55:01.475 --> 55:04.812
Don't worry, man.
We'll fill it up again.

55:05.771 --> 55:07.314
Things will get better.

55:08.357 --> 55:11.278
We'll fill the box back up.

55:19.077 --> 55:20.580
You want to hear the news?

55:21.497 --> 55:22.915
What news?

55:23.583 --> 55:25.752
You got good news and bad news.

55:27.962 --> 55:28.963
Shoot.

55:29.172 --> 55:33.218
Good news is, in a couple of
days, they'll be prime back.

55:34.678 --> 55:35.429
Really?

55:38.265 --> 55:39.058
Who told you?

55:40.226 --> 55:41.227
Angel.

55:41.436 --> 55:42.520
Yeah?

55:42.896 --> 55:44.814
Says Sal sent word...

55:45.023 --> 55:47.484
to let go a couple of
keys for Christmas.

55:47.692 --> 55:49.069
Not wanting anybody...

55:49.319 --> 55:51.989
wantin' this glorious season.

55:52.406 --> 55:53.532
You believe it?

55:53.866 --> 55:56.744
I did, until I heard
the bad news.

56:03.418 --> 56:04.252
Yeah?

56:05.087 --> 56:07.381
Price is doubled and you
have to cop for weight.

56:08.131 --> 56:09.717
At least half a piece.

56:10.009 --> 56:10.802
How much?

56:12.095 --> 56:13.137
Two.

56:14.263 --> 56:15.681
Two? That's fucking insane!

56:16.099 --> 56:17.350
What the fuck you gonna do?

56:17.558 --> 56:19.812
He won't lay no nickel
bag on you.

56:20.104 --> 56:21.730
Where we gonna get two?

56:22.689 --> 56:23.899
You mean Arnold?

56:25.275 --> 56:27.820
Your parents won't even
return your call.

56:29.781 --> 56:31.241
I haven't seen him in months.

56:31.741 --> 56:33.201
So what? He's still calling.

56:34.202 --> 56:35.328
I don't know.

56:37.122 --> 56:38.706
I don't know what else to do.

56:39.917 --> 56:42.461
This is our last chance
to get back on track.

56:42.711 --> 56:45.631
We won't have to scuffle
and make that freezing scene.

56:48.718 --> 56:50.637
We need the bread.

56:50.846 --> 56:53.515
Getting the money
is not the problem.

56:54.224 --> 56:56.184
Then what is the problem?

56:56.852 --> 56:59.020
Don't know what I'll
have to do to get it.

57:06.696 --> 57:07.697
Look...

57:08.364 --> 57:09.366
baby...

57:11.076 --> 57:13.579
we'll be back in business
in no time.

57:15.038 --> 57:18.834
We'll start moving again
and saving.

57:21.129 --> 57:25.133
It'll be perfect. Just
like it was. I promise.

57:29.680 --> 57:31.348
You'll see.

57:39.900 --> 57:43.862
I had the flu forever,
it seems like.

57:46.990 --> 57:48.533
Are you depressed?

57:48.909 --> 57:50.036
No, nothing like that.

57:50.328 --> 57:52.830
I've been really busy.

57:53.790 --> 57:56.918
I've been designing non stop.

57:57.126 --> 58:00.047
I'm glad to hear you've
been productive.

58:05.177 --> 58:09.182
To be frank, I was surprised
to hear from you.

58:13.937 --> 58:15.146
Something wrong?

58:15.522 --> 58:17.107
No, why?

58:17.732 --> 58:21.195
That's usually the case
when you get a call...

58:21.445 --> 58:22.905
from someone you haven't
heard from for a while.

58:23.739 --> 58:24.907
Everything's fine.

58:29.621 --> 58:30.789
Actually...

58:35.502 --> 58:37.045
I have a favor to ask.

58:43.386 --> 58:45.805
You smug fuck!

58:46.848 --> 58:47.765
What is it?

58:53.981 --> 58:55.149
I need to borrow some money.

58:55.482 --> 58:57.109
May I ask for what?

58:59.821 --> 59:00.947
Turn the light off.

59:01.364 --> 59:02.866
What for?

59:03.908 --> 59:05.452
Just do it.

59:06.411 --> 59:07.287
You never did before.

59:07.495 --> 59:09.081
Please, Arnold.

01:02:38.562 --> 01:02:39.855
Where is everybody?

01:02:40.147 --> 01:02:41.481
I don't know, man.

01:02:42.357 --> 01:02:44.484
They said meet at Waldbaum's.

01:02:47.989 --> 01:02:49.323
Sure this is the right one?

01:02:49.574 --> 01:02:51.159
Yeah, man, I'm positive.

01:02:52.702 --> 01:02:56.038
You watch my back,
and I'll watch yours.

01:03:00.502 --> 01:03:01.587
What the fuck now?

01:03:15.393 --> 01:03:16.895
Everyone and their mother.

01:03:19.148 --> 01:03:21.275
The truck's going to be here.
Back up.

01:03:24.695 --> 01:03:25.738
Back up!

01:03:34.414 --> 01:03:36.082
Here we go, guys.

01:04:53.918 --> 01:04:55.962
Stupid fucking junkie.
We're fucked!

01:04:56.171 --> 01:04:59.258
We're fucked.
That's the last shit for miles.

01:04:59.508 --> 01:05:00.342
Muthafuckas going back
to Florida...

01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:02.970
while we're ass deep
in motherfucking snow.

01:05:07.726 --> 01:05:09.436
What if we went to cop?

01:05:09.978 --> 01:05:10.896
You serious?

01:05:11.104 --> 01:05:12.230
Why not?

01:05:12.439 --> 01:05:14.232
What the fuck are you saying?

01:05:14.441 --> 01:05:16.067
We go to a fuckin' room clerk...

01:05:16.276 --> 01:05:18.571
and ask him for a connection?

01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:21.032
You can't nose out some
dope when it's around?

01:05:23.576 --> 01:05:25.661
We got nothin' to lose.

01:05:25.953 --> 01:05:27.998
If we get there now...

01:05:28.332 --> 01:05:29.500
we name our price...

01:05:29.708 --> 01:05:30.959
and be cool.

01:05:31.210 --> 01:05:33.045
Have them scufflin' for us.

01:05:35.464 --> 01:05:39.260
Last summer was a mother
fucking ball.

01:05:44.682 --> 01:05:47.269
Seems like a thousand years ago.

01:05:48.687 --> 01:05:50.106
It'll be back like that.

01:05:54.819 --> 01:05:59.282
Angel'll get us a short if we
get him some dynamite scag.

01:07:18.745 --> 01:07:19.954
Where have you been?

01:07:20.622 --> 01:07:22.040
Where the hell do you think?

01:07:23.416 --> 01:07:24.709
Where's the score?

01:07:25.001 --> 01:07:26.587
We had a bit of a problem.

01:07:26.879 --> 01:07:30.466
Everything was going good,
and then...

01:07:30.883 --> 01:07:32.176
some dumb ass junkie...

01:07:32.384 --> 01:07:33.135
Did what?

01:07:33.385 --> 01:07:35.095
Some dumb ass junkie did what?

01:07:35.387 --> 01:07:36.556
You fucked it up?

01:07:37.349 --> 01:07:38.391
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:07:38.725 --> 01:07:40.393
You promised everything
was going to be okay.

01:07:40.602 --> 01:07:42.896
I fucked that sleazebag for you.

01:07:43.104 --> 01:07:44.856
I put myself through fucking hell!

01:07:45.148 --> 01:07:46.108
There's nothing out there.

01:07:46.359 --> 01:07:47.485
I don't give a shit!

01:07:47.777 --> 01:07:49.779
You fucking loser!

01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:54.867
You want extra stuff?

01:07:55.409 --> 01:07:57.496
A guy's holding some extra weight.

01:07:58.330 --> 01:07:59.581
But he ain't selling!

01:08:01.625 --> 01:08:02.668
<i>Yeah?</i>

01:08:02.876 --> 01:08:03.919
Give me that guy's number.

01:08:04.086 --> 01:08:05.170
<i>What guy?</i>

01:08:05.379 --> 01:08:06.297
The guy who likes broads.

01:08:06.506 --> 01:08:07.549
<i>Big Tim?</i>

01:08:07.757 --> 01:08:09.509
Give me the fucking number.

01:08:09.843 --> 01:08:10.969
<i>Alright. 9, 3, 4...</i>

01:08:11.344 --> 01:08:13.138
<i>8, 7, 7, 7.</i>

01:08:15.849 --> 01:08:18.685
Here, go fix yourself
up with him.

01:08:18.894 --> 01:08:20.895
You won't have to wait so much...

01:08:21.104 --> 01:08:23.399
and I won't freeze my ass off
in the fucking streets.

01:09:00.273 --> 01:09:01.774
<i>We got a winner.</i>

01:09:02.024 --> 01:09:03.359
<i>We got a winner.</i>

01:09:03.568 --> 01:09:04.402
<i>We got a winner.</i>

01:09:04.611 --> 01:09:06.322
<i>We got a winner.</i>

01:09:07.781 --> 01:09:10.576
<i>A beautiful woman with</i>
<i>a winning sense of humor...</i>

01:09:11.076 --> 01:09:13.162
<i>and a magical smile.</i>

01:09:13.496 --> 01:09:15.413
From Brighton Beach, Brooklyn.

01:09:15.790 --> 01:09:20.420
Give a juicy welcome to our
very own Mrs. Sara Goldfarb.

01:09:21.129 --> 01:09:23.590
<i>Juice by Sara!</i>
<i>Juice by Sara!</i>

01:09:24.049 --> 01:09:26.093
<i>Juice by Sara!</i>

01:09:26.301 --> 01:09:29.430
<i>Juice by Sara!</i>

01:09:31.765 --> 01:09:33.059
It's a pleasure to be here.

01:09:33.267 --> 01:09:34.560
It's a pleasure to have you.

01:09:34.769 --> 01:09:36.939
That is one smashing dress.

01:09:41.193 --> 01:09:43.529
Thank you, Tappy.
I'd like to say hello...

01:09:43.821 --> 01:09:45.447
to my husband Seymour...

01:09:45.656 --> 01:09:48.576
<i>and to my beautiful,</i>
<i>successful son Harold.</i>

01:09:50.495 --> 01:09:52.872
Harold, I hope you're in love.

01:09:54.707 --> 01:09:56.877
Come see me and bring Marion.

01:09:57.753 --> 01:09:59.171
He'll be here soon.

01:10:01.215 --> 01:10:02.508
Are you ready?

01:10:03.634 --> 01:10:05.177
I'm ready, Tappy.

01:10:07.305 --> 01:10:09.224
Not to worry.

01:10:12.477 --> 01:10:14.104
What are you doing here?

01:10:15.731 --> 01:10:16.899
Why are you here?

01:10:18.109 --> 01:10:18.734
This place...

01:10:19.110 --> 01:10:19.986
What do you want?

01:10:20.736 --> 01:10:21.863
Tappy!

01:10:22.155 --> 01:10:23.447
Join us in creating excellence.

01:10:24.699 --> 01:10:26.994
I thought you'd never ask.

01:10:34.543 --> 01:10:36.254
That's disgusting.

01:10:36.421 --> 01:10:37.630
What do you expect?

01:10:39.466 --> 01:10:40.717
Could you do better?

01:10:43.136 --> 01:10:46.432
It's an old building.
It hasn't been painted in years.

01:10:47.349 --> 01:10:49.727
I'm old. Alone.

01:10:50.519 --> 01:10:51.770
You don't understand.

01:10:52.354 --> 01:10:54.231
Please, I'll explain.

01:11:35.653 --> 01:11:37.404
I don't want this.

01:11:38.823 --> 01:11:39.990
Get away from me!

01:11:41.283 --> 01:11:42.326
Ready, Mrs. Goldfarb?

01:11:42.535 --> 01:11:43.494
For what?

01:11:43.702 --> 01:11:44.912
3... 2...

01:12:37.596 --> 01:12:38.680
Feed me, Sara.

01:12:40.682 --> 01:12:41.850
Feed me, Sara.

01:12:42.267 --> 01:12:43.977
Feed me, Sara.

01:12:44.311 --> 01:12:46.022
Feed me, Sara.

01:12:46.397 --> 01:12:50.109
Feed me, Sara.
Feed me, Sara.

01:12:50.359 --> 01:12:52.653
Feed me, Sara.

01:12:54.113 --> 01:12:57.159
Feed me, Sara.
Feed me, Sara.

01:12:57.826 --> 01:13:00.704
Feed me, Sara.
Feed me, Sara.

01:13:38.371 --> 01:13:40.414
Thank you, Angel.

01:13:42.834 --> 01:13:46.880
Hope this mutha' fucker works.
Could use some heat.

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.299
How long will it take?

01:13:49.716 --> 01:13:50.884
We'll make it in a day.

01:13:51.593 --> 01:13:52.594
A day.

01:13:52.970 --> 01:13:55.932
Shit. California, here we come.

01:13:56.474 --> 01:13:57.642
It's Florida.

01:13:58.810 --> 01:14:02.397
Either way, your pale ass
getting a tan, right?

01:14:07.027 --> 01:14:09.196
This train go to Madison Avenue?

01:14:10.406 --> 01:14:11.866
You know Maylin and Block?

01:14:12.283 --> 01:14:14.870
I have their address.
They're on Madison Ave.

01:14:15.579 --> 01:14:17.122
I'm going to be on TV.

01:14:17.455 --> 01:14:18.874
You're whacked!

01:14:20.792 --> 01:14:23.211
Hello?

01:14:23.795 --> 01:14:25.923
This train go to Madison Avenue?

01:14:28.176 --> 01:14:30.469
I'm going to be on TV.

01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:34.766
I just have to find out when.

01:14:36.393 --> 01:14:37.352
Florida?

01:14:40.898 --> 01:14:42.691
When's he back?

01:14:44.819 --> 01:14:46.029
A few days!?

01:14:46.446 --> 01:14:51.034
What am I supposed to do?
You gotta help me!

01:14:53.036 --> 01:14:54.705
I can get you money.

01:14:56.790 --> 01:14:59.210
Angel, there's got
to be something.

01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:00.044
Help me!

01:15:00.252 --> 01:15:02.087
<i>Why aren't you calling me?</i>

01:15:03.589 --> 01:15:06.134
<i>I have to know</i>
<i>when I'll be on TV.</i>

01:15:08.053 --> 01:15:11.598
I'm Sara Goldfarb and...

01:15:12.057 --> 01:15:14.936
you should tell me when
I'll be on TV.

01:15:15.394 --> 01:15:17.230
Sit, I'll ring them.

01:15:17.438 --> 01:15:19.440
I just want to know when.

01:15:19.815 --> 01:15:21.609
Maybe you lost my card.

01:15:21.901 --> 01:15:24.905
You'll have a look
and you'll tell me.

01:15:26.281 --> 01:15:27.866
It's not the prizes.

01:15:28.116 --> 01:15:29.076
I'll give them away.

01:15:30.285 --> 01:15:32.120
I just want to be on the show.

01:15:32.830 --> 01:15:34.791
I've waited so long...

01:15:35.291 --> 01:15:38.920
to be with my Harry
and grandson.

01:15:40.129 --> 01:15:42.298
Mrs. Goldfarb, sip this.

01:15:42.882 --> 01:15:46.136
Sometimes it takes a
while to get called.

01:15:52.726 --> 01:15:53.811
- This her?
- Yes.

01:15:54.354 --> 01:15:55.063
Can you walk?

01:15:55.397 --> 01:15:57.941
I'm walking across this stage.

01:15:58.567 --> 01:16:02.195
You should see my Harry
on television.

01:16:02.529 --> 01:16:04.699
We're giving the prizes away.

01:16:05.324 --> 01:16:08.077
I just wanted to be on the show!

01:16:10.955 --> 01:16:12.248
<i>What's her name?</i>

01:16:12.456 --> 01:16:13.166
<i>Sara Goldfarb.</i>

01:16:14.084 --> 01:16:17.921
Call Seymour to meet me
at the beauty parlor.

01:16:18.130 --> 01:16:20.841
I got the dress I wore
to Harry's graduation...

01:16:21.049 --> 01:16:22.426
and the gold shoes.

01:16:22.634 --> 01:16:24.470
Okay, Mrs. Goldfarb.

01:16:25.638 --> 01:16:27.557
One... two... three...

01:16:28.224 --> 01:16:30.101
Take it nice and easy.

01:16:54.337 --> 01:16:55.671
Yeah?

01:17:19.072 --> 01:17:20.198
Yeah?

01:17:22.242 --> 01:17:23.368
Hi.

01:17:28.165 --> 01:17:31.210
Rosa, I'm going to be on TV.

01:17:59.783 --> 01:18:03.830
Sheet. God damned Jim,
how long you had that?

01:18:05.248 --> 01:18:06.666
A few days.

01:18:07.292 --> 01:18:08.668
It don't look too good.

01:18:09.085 --> 01:18:10.962
I don't feel too good either.

01:18:14.049 --> 01:18:16.010
Some stuff'll take care of that.

01:18:16.218 --> 01:18:18.053
Don't shoot in there.

01:18:19.013 --> 01:18:20.389
I'll blow it if I don't.

01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:22.975
Fuck it!

01:18:35.823 --> 01:18:36.782
Oh, shit.

01:18:52.508 --> 01:18:54.135
Hi, can you hear me?

01:18:54.344 --> 01:18:55.428
Yes, Seymour.

01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:56.513
Did you take anything?

01:18:56.971 --> 01:18:58.890
I took my red dress in.

01:18:59.474 --> 01:19:00.892
Take her to psych.

01:19:12.947 --> 01:19:14.115
Come on in.

01:19:24.502 --> 01:19:25.962
What's your name?

01:19:28.548 --> 01:19:29.632
Marion.

01:19:29.966 --> 01:19:31.759
What do you know, Maid Marion.

01:19:40.477 --> 01:19:41.645
I'm Little John.

01:19:45.441 --> 01:19:46.818
Beautiful view...

01:19:47.026 --> 01:19:48.611
Know what I like about
patty chicks?

01:19:50.947 --> 01:19:52.365
They give good head.

01:19:53.993 --> 01:19:56.245
Black broads don't
give good head.

01:19:56.704 --> 01:19:58.122
I don't know why.

01:19:58.330 --> 01:20:01.458
Maybe it's because of some
ancient tribal customs.

01:20:23.317 --> 01:20:25.110
Save some of the energy.

01:20:42.796 --> 01:20:44.423
I know it's pretty, baby...

01:20:45.049 --> 01:20:46.717
but I didn't take it out for air.

01:21:04.195 --> 01:21:06.614
I told you to stay
away from that arm.

01:21:09.283 --> 01:21:11.202
I gotta call Marion.

01:21:11.577 --> 01:21:13.914
That's a long distance call now.

01:21:14.998 --> 01:21:16.542
That's 600 miles.

01:21:16.833 --> 01:21:19.419
We're 600 miles
closer to Miami.

01:21:19.711 --> 01:21:23.341
And 600 miles further
away from New York.

01:21:29.180 --> 01:21:30.932
I know where you could
pick up a nice taste.

01:21:31.599 --> 01:21:32.726
It's more like play.

01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:35.312
Sunday we're throwing a gathering.

01:21:35.729 --> 01:21:37.189
All good people.

01:21:38.274 --> 01:21:40.192
I can't, I'm busy.

01:21:40.401 --> 01:21:42.027
I'm not really hooked.

01:21:42.362 --> 01:21:45.365
I'm tellin' ya',
it's a real nice taste.

01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:53.749
See you Sunday, Maid Marion.

01:21:55.751 --> 01:21:58.170
Try and answer my questions.

01:21:58.546 --> 01:21:59.922
When did you start the pills?

01:22:02.133 --> 01:22:03.135
The summer.

01:22:03.468 --> 01:22:04.595
Last summer?

01:22:04.928 --> 01:22:07.180
I got the best place. In the sun.

01:22:08.140 --> 01:22:09.808
Ada fixed my hair.

01:22:10.017 --> 01:22:11.435
Everything'll be alright.

01:22:11.977 --> 01:22:13.771
We'll get you fixed up in no time.

01:22:35.420 --> 01:22:36.379
You're okay.

01:22:36.796 --> 01:22:40.508
I can't cut it. I gotta do
something about this arm.

01:22:40.967 --> 01:22:42.553
Let's see it.

01:22:49.977 --> 01:22:52.022
Oh, damn, Jim.

01:22:54.024 --> 01:22:55.192
Oh, man.

01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:57.027
That's an ugly mothafucka'.

01:22:57.861 --> 01:22:59.196
I gotta call Marion.

01:22:59.488 --> 01:23:02.825
Fuck that. We got to
get you to a hospital.

01:23:07.956 --> 01:23:09.457
What is that?

01:23:12.169 --> 01:23:13.295
I don't want that.

01:23:52.672 --> 01:23:53.840
What's the problem?

01:23:54.048 --> 01:23:56.593
My arm, it's killing me.

01:23:56.843 --> 01:23:57.969
Let's have a look.

01:24:02.933 --> 01:24:03.601
Alright.

01:24:08.022 --> 01:24:09.773
I'll be back in a minute.

01:24:36.220 --> 01:24:38.513
I want to play blackjack
all night.

01:24:39.014 --> 01:24:40.265
<i>So I make up this routine.</i>

01:24:40.474 --> 01:24:42.018
<i>I tell them I don't feel good.</i>

01:24:42.227 --> 01:24:43.728
<i>Have a good time dancing, guys.</i>

01:24:44.020 --> 01:24:45.813
<i>They leave the room.</i>

01:24:46.189 --> 01:24:49.567
Ready? One... two... three...

01:24:49.984 --> 01:24:54.240
<i>As soon as they leave, I</i>
<i>run back down to the casino.</i>

01:24:54.448 --> 01:24:57.660
<i>Sit at my blackjack</i>
<i>table the whole night.</i>

01:24:57.952 --> 01:25:00.246
<i>Finally I got up big.</i>

01:25:00.538 --> 01:25:03.792
<i>I got $500 black chips.</i>

01:25:04.292 --> 01:25:07.087
<i>Hours are going by,</i>
<i>I'm laying bets.</i>

01:25:10.799 --> 01:25:13.678
<i>Next thing, this guy</i>
<i>is sitting next to me.</i>

01:25:14.220 --> 01:25:15.388
<i>A security guard.</i>

01:25:15.638 --> 01:25:17.265
<i>Tells me I have to leave.</i>

01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:21.060
<i>I'm like "why leave?"</i>

01:25:35.285 --> 01:25:36.828
S-w-a-l-l-o-w!

01:26:06.861 --> 01:26:08.321
You have to eat.

01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:10.615
To get healthy, you have to eat.

01:26:11.366 --> 01:26:12.910
Work with the attendants.

01:26:13.285 --> 01:26:15.245
I'll try some new medications.

01:27:17.689 --> 01:27:18.690
Hello?

01:27:19.023 --> 01:27:19.941
Marion?

01:27:21.527 --> 01:27:22.653
Harry?

01:27:24.029 --> 01:27:27.700
I've been thinking about you.

01:27:28.993 --> 01:27:30.536
Are you okay?

01:27:33.498 --> 01:27:35.125
When are you coming home?

01:27:36.167 --> 01:27:37.085
Soon.

01:27:37.836 --> 01:27:38.753
When?

01:27:40.463 --> 01:27:44.302
<i>Soon. You holding out alright?</i>

01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:45.595
Harry...

01:27:48.890 --> 01:27:50.767
can you come today?

01:28:03.781 --> 01:28:05.241
I'll come.

01:28:06.910 --> 01:28:08.536
<i>I'll come today.</i>

01:28:13.876 --> 01:28:15.836
Just wait for me, alright?

01:28:19.632 --> 01:28:20.759
Okay, Harry.

01:28:21.009 --> 01:28:22.552
I'm coming back.

01:28:23.637 --> 01:28:24.346
Yeah.

01:28:24.554 --> 01:28:25.555
Marion.

01:28:25.764 --> 01:28:26.348
Yeah.

01:28:27.891 --> 01:28:30.060
I'm sorry, Marion.

01:28:30.728 --> 01:28:32.104
I know.

01:28:41.531 --> 01:28:42.991
Mrs. Goldfarb...

01:28:45.452 --> 01:28:46.870
are you alright?

01:28:49.456 --> 01:28:51.709
Mrs. Goldfarb...

01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:54.337
<i>we've tried several</i>
<i>medications...</i>

01:28:54.754 --> 01:28:56.798
and you don't respond.

01:28:57.006 --> 01:28:58.967
We might want to try some...

01:28:59.175 --> 01:29:01.011
alternative methods.

01:29:01.637 --> 01:29:04.598
We've had excellent results
with ECT in the past.

01:29:05.975 --> 01:29:09.937
So if I can just get
your John Hancock...

01:29:11.398 --> 01:29:13.358
we'll get underway.

01:29:16.194 --> 01:29:17.404
Jesus Christ.

01:29:19.531 --> 01:29:21.075
I need a doctor.

01:29:21.909 --> 01:29:24.704
My friend is sick.
Can you help?

01:29:24.912 --> 01:29:28.374
I can't take it. My arm!

01:29:30.544 --> 01:29:31.878
Help me!

01:29:32.212 --> 01:29:34.715
Somebody fucking help us, please!

01:29:56.739 --> 01:29:57.907

Can you see me?

01:30:56.805 --> 01:30:58.390
Something wrong with his arm.

01:30:58.890 --> 01:30:59.725
Ma...

01:31:01.060 --> 01:31:03.646
You won't be putting

01:31:04.188 --> 01:31:05.648
It smells worse than he do.

01:31:06.065 --> 01:31:07.441
Get him to the hospital.

01:31:07.692 --> 01:31:09.235
He won't live out the week.

01:31:12.072 --> 01:31:12.864

01:31:36.181 --> 01:31:38.434
<i>That's the trouble with</i>
<i>New York dope fiends.</i>

01:31:44.482 --> 01:31:45.650

01:31:58.205 --> 01:32:01.418
Put your spineless back into it.
