Every night since the funeral.

02:18.840 --> 02:21.525
Comes back in the morning to see Charles
and feed the horses,

02:21.600 --> 02:23.841
and when it gets dark,
he goes off again.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.363
He used to sleep out when he was a kid.

02:28.840 --> 02:30.729
Curly would find him in the pasture.

Right, let's go.

04:20.760 --> 04:21.966
Uh, we've already seen him.

04:27.040 --> 04:29.441
He wanted to see people
in a particular order.

04:31.920 --> 04:36.448
I can normally read him, but he's
difficult to read, so be careful.

04:37.960 --> 04:40.247
I thought it was
a fucking family meeting.

All of us together, I thought.

04:42.160 --> 04:43.491
John, he's grieving.

04:43.560 --> 04:45.767
To see everyone together
would be too much.

04:46.080 --> 04:49.607
Yeah, well... Come on, john.

Hi, Tom.

05:21.160 --> 05:22.286
Hello, boys.

05:22.720 --> 05:27.851
We, uh, didn't get a chance to see you
after the funeral.

05:28.600 --> 05:32.969
Well, you disappeared on us, but, well,
me and john, we just wanna say that...

05:33.040 --> 05:34.087
Arthur, shut up.

We got to Angel at the hospital

What about the old man?

05:56.720 --> 05:58.085
We interrogated his boys.

05:58.160 --> 05:59.685
Yeah, he went to Liverpool.

He's waiting
for an immigrant ship to New York.

His wife.

So shoot her, and bring him to me.

15:21.880 --> 15:25.805
just keep things the way they are.

15:31.240 --> 15:32.287
Here you go.

15:34.320 --> 15:36.448
Yeah. Here you go.

15:38.360 --> 15:39.850
I'm not much good, Charlie.

15:41.120 --> 15:43.441
-(CHARLIE EXCLAIMS)
- You'll find that out soon enough.

15:46.760 --> 15:49.127
She's not gonna be coming back,
so it's just you and me.

15:52.440 --> 15:56.570
She'll be with us in our hearts
'cause we love her.

15:57.160 --> 15:58.207
- JOHNNY: Tommy.
- Yeah.

15:58.280 --> 16:00.089
This fucking horse of yours
won't come to me.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.083
- All right, I'll be there. All right.
- Huh? Come on.

16:04.120 --> 16:05.929
That was her favourite horse, Charlie,

16:07.640 --> 16:09.688
and he's been all over the place
since she's gone.

16:11.760 --> 16:13.330
- Tom?
- Yeah, you watch him.

16:13.400 --> 16:14.606
I will. Oh, yeah.

16:15.480 --> 16:16.481
Huh?

16:27.320 --> 16:30.483
All right, now cock it with your thumb.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.570
-(CHUCKLES)
-(GUN COCKS)

16:37.960 --> 16:41.089
There you go. Now she's been cocked.

16:41.440 --> 16:43.329
- She's alive in your hand.
-(CROWING)

16:43.800 --> 16:46.326
It's like waking up a girl
when you cock that trigger.

16:47.080 --> 16:50.402
She rolls over all sleepy-eyed
and she goes,

16:51.080 --> 16:54.641
-"Michael. Michael."
-(jOHN CHUCKLING)

16:55.760 --> 16:57.842
"What are you gonna make me do,
Michael?"

16:57.920 --> 17:01.686
You boys are fucking crazy men.

17:01.760 --> 17:04.730
- Yeah, but you feel it, though, right?
- Yeah.

17:05.119 --> 17:06.326
You feel it.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.767
Yeah, you can feel the power.

17:09.280 --> 17:12.284
Now, squeeze it.

17:15.119 --> 17:16.121
(GUNSHOT)

17:17.800 --> 17:18.961
Powerful.

17:19.040 --> 17:22.407
- Fucking useless.
- Piss off, john.

17:22.480 --> 17:29.125
Michael, why does a pen pusher who sits
on his arse all day wanna fire a gun?

17:29.400 --> 17:31.528
Hmm? Eh?

17:32.520 --> 17:34.090
Cock it again.

17:35.440 --> 17:37.090
- Cock it again.
-jOHN: Cock it again.

17:37.240 --> 17:38.446
Round two.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.325
-(GUN COCKS)
- ARTHUR: Mmm.

17:43.240 --> 17:45.481
Look at that fucking face, john boy.

17:46.480 --> 17:48.084
Look at that face.

17:49.240 --> 17:50.890
Now he feels it.

17:51.560 --> 17:53.847
But you won't feel nothing

17:54.520 --> 17:58.684
until you point that thing on a man.

18:00.720 --> 18:03.644
So do it.

18:10.720 --> 18:13.451
There you go, young boss.

18:14.880 --> 18:17.724
There you go. Now you feel it.

18:17.800 --> 18:20.041
Now you feel what we feel.

18:20.920 --> 18:23.526
This is what it's like.

18:24.520 --> 18:28.047
Michael, that's a Webley.

18:28.640 --> 18:30.165
Jumps on the hammer.

18:30.760 --> 18:32.603
How does it feel, Michael, huh?

18:33.920 --> 18:36.241
Better than having a pen
in your hand, isn't it?

18:37.080 --> 18:41.165
More like having your cock in your hand.
Yeah.

18:41.760 --> 18:43.046
Yeah, it is.

18:45.640 --> 18:47.529
One squeeze.

18:48.480 --> 18:49.481
(GRUNTS)

18:50.320 --> 18:51.321
I'm gone.

18:52.440 --> 18:54.204
I'm fucking meat.

18:54.600 --> 18:58.605
Michael, you fucking watch
that Webley don'tjump. You know that?

18:58.880 --> 19:01.281
When you pull that fucking trigger,

19:02.600 --> 19:06.969
and the body of the man you shot
wraps itself around your ankles,

19:08.720 --> 19:11.644
-they pile up.
-(MICHAEL BREATHING HEAVILY)

19:12.360 --> 19:15.807
It gets to the point
where you can't walk in a room

19:17.080 --> 19:19.447
without bringing
a load of them with you.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.445
POLLY: What's going on?

19:33.680 --> 19:34.681
What's going on?

19:34.960 --> 19:39.409
Polly, we're just
educating the boss here

19:40.640 --> 19:42.404
one our side of the business.

19:44.640 --> 19:48.201
Michael, get in the house.

20:05.480 --> 20:08.370
I'm not a fucking kid any more.

20:29.760 --> 20:32.240
(GUNSHOTS)

20:40.160 --> 20:42.208
(GUNSHOTS)

21:34.960 --> 21:36.200
You've come to tell me it's cancelled.

21:36.280 --> 21:37.725
No, why would it be?

21:37.800 --> 21:38.881
I read the papers.

21:38.960 --> 21:41.406
- This is business.
- It won't work.

21:42.360 --> 21:44.488
I told your brother,
this whole fucking plan won't work.

21:44.560 --> 21:46.801
If Tommy wants to keep this secret...
Tell him.

21:46.880 --> 21:50.089
There was a woman in a fur coat
walking through here in broad daylight

21:50.160 --> 21:53.289
like the Queen of fucking Sheba
asking about armoured cars.

21:53.360 --> 21:57.046
During a period of grieving,
some things were allowed to slip.

21:57.560 --> 22:00.450
We know the woman.
We're dealing with it.

22:01.080 --> 22:04.448
Now, take a look at this list.

22:04.520 --> 22:06.329
These are all the men
who work the night shift

22:06.440 --> 22:09.125
who are members
of the South Birmingham Communist Party.

22:09.200 --> 22:12.761
You've got six weeks. Sack them all.

22:23.440 --> 22:25.010
Are you fucking mad?

22:25.880 --> 22:27.041
He is.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.001
Yeah.

22:29.320 --> 22:31.163
Every factory in the city
will come out on strike.

22:31.240 --> 22:34.528
So? You find reasons.

22:36.120 --> 22:37.485
You set them up.

22:38.800 --> 22:40.006
You sack them.

22:40.080 --> 22:41.241
Look at the list again.

22:41.880 --> 22:44.406
Are there any communists on your shift
who aren't on the list?

22:47.440 --> 22:48.566
No.

22:49.680 --> 22:51.682
Please don't fucking lie to us.

22:51.760 --> 22:53.967
- Who's missing?
- I don't know.

22:58.560 --> 22:59.686
Emmanuel Hunter.

23:00.960 --> 23:01.961
Hmm?

23:03.840 --> 23:09.051
Convener, deputy treasurer,
Sparkhill Communist Party.

23:09.720 --> 23:11.563
Lathe operator to you.

23:12.440 --> 23:13.771
I didn't know he was a communist.

23:14.400 --> 23:17.006
We left that name
off the list on purpose.

23:18.280 --> 23:20.362
See if you could be trusted.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.445
You can't be trusted.

23:23.520 --> 23:25.648
Look, I'm just a working man.

23:25.720 --> 23:27.290
JOHN: We're gonna be watching you.

23:28.560 --> 23:31.291
- Watching your fucking house.
- I've got kids.

23:34.160 --> 23:35.286
Ethan and john.

23:39.720 --> 23:41.290
Just get them sacked

23:42.920 --> 23:45.571
as they appear on the list, two a week.

23:46.800 --> 23:49.451
The last one before
the clocks go forward.

23:51.440 --> 23:53.090
Is that a yes or a no?

23:55.120 --> 23:56.565
- Yes.
- Thank you.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.571
-(METAL CLANKING)
-(MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)

24:13.560 --> 24:14.686
Good.

24:15.480 --> 24:16.561
Good.

24:29.400 --> 24:31.687
- Do you think he'll return?
- Tommy?

24:36.440 --> 24:37.771
He'll always come back.

24:39.880 --> 24:40.881
You speak differently when you talk...

24:40.960 --> 24:42.724
I prefer to talk about other things.

24:43.440 --> 24:44.680
Let me see.

24:46.280 --> 24:49.170
What books do you like?

24:50.320 --> 24:53.290
Riding, flower arranging, embroidery?

24:53.360 --> 24:55.362
You'd be surprised of the things I know.

24:58.760 --> 25:01.081
You'd also be surprised
of the things I don't know.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.282
What could you possibly not know?

25:05.520 --> 25:06.885
I wasn't educated.

25:12.920 --> 25:15.241
- At all.
- What is there to learn, after all?

25:24.080 --> 25:25.081
Goodness.

25:27.320 --> 25:29.607
I'm sorry. You must need a rest.

25:41.960 --> 25:44.201
Do you tell your friends
you're painting a gangster?

25:47.560 --> 25:49.130
Is that the fun in all of this?

25:50.040 --> 25:51.610
In truth, I don't have any friends.

25:53.360 --> 25:55.089
I knew everyone through my wife.

25:57.640 --> 25:58.926
When she died...

26:02.760 --> 26:03.841
Well...

26:07.640 --> 26:08.880
Look, Polly,

26:10.920 --> 26:13.321
my motivation for doing this is twofold.

26:14.280 --> 26:19.047
Firstly, you have a face
full of contradictions,

26:20.200 --> 26:22.806
and it's a challenge
to capture them in one expression.

26:23.120 --> 26:25.009
-(SCOFFS)
- That's the sales pitch.

26:26.960 --> 26:32.729
The second motivation is that
I am planning to seduce you eventually

26:34.240 --> 26:36.208
and, please God, sleep with you.

26:36.640 --> 26:38.244
How would that please God?

26:38.880 --> 26:40.291
Please me.

27:17.920 --> 27:19.081
And stop.

27:24.440 --> 27:25.930
And he didn't say what he wants.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.809
When he was drunk, he said absolution.

27:29.440 --> 27:30.805
Other than that, nothing.

27:51.360 --> 27:53.362
Thank you for your time, Madame Boswell.

27:55.040 --> 27:56.929
I heard someone shot your wife.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.606
If you're looking for soldiers,
our men are all up at Appleby.

28:04.800 --> 28:06.564
I have no need for soldiers.

28:07.640 --> 28:09.085
It's not why I came here.

28:21.480 --> 28:22.481
What do you think?

28:22.800 --> 28:24.040
You're selling?

28:24.120 --> 28:25.281
Giving.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.650
- Why?
- Would you take it?

28:30.560 --> 28:31.766
I'd take it.

28:32.480 --> 28:33.686
Would you wear it?

28:33.760 --> 28:35.762
- Why would I not?
- That's my question.

28:43.440 --> 28:45.807
My wife was wearing it
the night she was shot,

28:48.800 --> 28:54.330
and I lie awake at night
at 4:00 in the fucking morning,

28:54.400 --> 28:56.801
and I blame myself for her death.

28:58.640 --> 29:00.404
I pushed some people too far.

29:02.160 --> 29:04.766
You want me to tell you
this jewel is cursed,

29:07.320 --> 29:09.607
and then her death won't be
all your fault.

29:17.440 --> 29:19.522
If I believed in the priests,

29:20.280 --> 29:22.521
I would confess and ask for forgiveness,

29:23.840 --> 29:26.764
but all I have is you, Madame Boswell.

29:28.280 --> 29:29.770
I have a son.

29:31.920 --> 29:33.684
I have a business.

29:34.240 --> 29:35.810
I need to get some sleep.

29:39.600 --> 29:40.965
It is cursed.

29:43.160 --> 29:46.448
I feel its curse
burning through my heart.

29:53.360 --> 29:55.283
Bless you, Tommy Shelby.

29:56.280 --> 29:58.408
You'll have good fortune from now on.

29:58.480 --> 30:00.926
- The business is done?
- It's done.

30:01.960 --> 30:04.725
You're not going to give me
one fucking clue what that was about?

30:05.360 --> 30:08.842
All religion is a foolish answer
to a foolish question.

30:09.200 --> 30:10.440
What does that mean?

30:10.520 --> 30:11.931
Go and get Charlie from the camp.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.002
He'll have learned enough
bad habits by now.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.923
You can drop us to the train station.

30:17.920 --> 30:21.402
And johnny boy, if I were you,

30:21.640 --> 30:24.883
I'd come back here tonight later on.

30:27.280 --> 30:29.681
It's gonna be
one hell of a big fucking party.

30:34.520 --> 30:37.364
MAN: The day and date on your ticket.

30:37.480 --> 30:40.927
If you can't read, find someone who can.

30:41.760 --> 30:45.446
Tickets for sailings other than today's
will be destroyed.

30:45.560 --> 30:47.289
He has people all over the docks.

30:47.360 --> 30:49.408
If it's going to happen,
it will happen now.

30:49.480 --> 30:51.005
We'll be all right.

30:51.080 --> 30:54.289
Why don't these Irish
fill in their papers in advance?

30:54.360 --> 30:58.331
Think about Mott Street, the café,
the smell of the coffee.

30:59.320 --> 31:01.766
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

31:46.000 --> 31:49.083
Police! Help! Police!

31:52.000 --> 31:55.209
Officer, there are some men,
they mean us harm.

31:55.280 --> 31:58.682
We are in danger here.
Can you escort us to the dock?

32:00.640 --> 32:01.687
Please.

32:01.840 --> 32:03.001
Come with me.

32:04.640 --> 32:07.211
Excuse me, brother. You got a light?

32:56.160 --> 32:57.207
Thank you, Officer.

32:58.360 --> 33:00.283
- That'll be all.
-john Shelby.

33:01.560 --> 33:06.771
Is that the lad I used to teach?
john Shelby, I smacked your arse.

33:07.360 --> 33:08.486
Let him go.

33:09.600 --> 33:12.331
- Please. Please, let her go.
- Arthur?

33:12.840 --> 33:16.890
How many times I looked the other way
because of your sweet smile.

33:17.360 --> 33:19.931
I said, let him go. He's coming with us.

33:21.080 --> 33:23.651
Not until I know my wife is safe.

33:24.600 --> 33:27.604
She's safe. We're not going to harm her.

33:28.400 --> 33:29.401
Let's just get a move on.

33:29.480 --> 33:33.326
Look, we're disobeying Tommy's orders
just by talking to you.

33:34.600 --> 33:36.807
Don't push it, please.

33:38.400 --> 33:40.528
- Come with us. Let him go.
- AUDREY: Let him go, too.

33:40.840 --> 33:42.285
Say it's done.

33:42.960 --> 33:46.123
Say he's in the harbour.
He can do you no harm from New York.

33:46.200 --> 33:50.330
I can't do that, Mrs Changretta.
I can't do that. Sorry.

33:50.400 --> 33:52.368
OK, OK. Audrey, listen.

33:52.440 --> 33:54.010
- No!
- Listen to me!

33:54.800 --> 33:58.691
Go to the café in Mott Street.
Bonito will take care of you.

33:58.880 --> 34:02.327
Let him go, too. He's an old man.

34:02.640 --> 34:04.529
I gave you sweets and cakes.

34:04.600 --> 34:06.170
Mrs Changretta, there are rules.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.684
Your husband knows the rules.

34:09.960 --> 34:11.291
- Come on, old man.
- AUDREY: No.

34:13.480 --> 34:14.719
Sorry.

34:16.560 --> 34:18.527
We're disobeying orders here.

34:19.280 --> 34:22.329
Let him fucking go!

34:23.800 --> 34:26.485
You have 10 seconds,
or Tommy's orders stand.

34:27.560 --> 34:29.608
They stand. One!

34:30.880 --> 34:32.848
- Two!
- Please!

34:34.679 --> 34:36.011
Three.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.002
- I love you forever.
- Four.

34:45.840 --> 34:47.126
(sesame)

34:53.040 --> 34:58.604
- No, no, no!
- America. A new life.

34:58.680 --> 35:02.241
No, no, no! (WAILING)

35:02.320 --> 35:03.731
A new love.

35:09.400 --> 35:11.562
(CONTINUES WAI LING)

36:20.920 --> 36:22.968
(PRAYING IN ITALIAN)

36:36.280 --> 36:39.329
Do you know what time it is, old man?

36:42.320 --> 36:43.924
I'll tell you.

36:44.440 --> 36:46.408
(CONTINUES PRAYING)

36:48.520 --> 36:50.284
It's after seven in the evening,

36:53.000 --> 36:57.767
and I'm going to keep you alive
until it gets light.

37:03.360 --> 37:06.045
I'll not deliver the final cut

37:06.880 --> 37:09.850
until we can both hear
the blackbirds singing outside.

37:16.360 --> 37:18.647
It's a beautiful sound,

37:21.320 --> 37:23.322
which my wife will never hear again.

37:38.160 --> 37:41.448
Now, I'm gonna have to choose carefully

37:43.920 --> 37:47.242
which part of you I cut away first.

37:51.440 --> 37:52.851
Open your eyes.

37:53.840 --> 37:58.562
Open your eyes,
or I will cut away your fucking eyelids!

38:02.360 --> 38:04.089
Now look at me.

38:05.200 --> 38:06.884
Look at me.

38:08.840 --> 38:10.330
This is the end.

38:12.360 --> 38:13.885
This is the end.

38:20.880 --> 38:23.167
It was your tongue that gave the order.

38:26.720 --> 38:29.041
I'll take your tongue first.

38:31.760 --> 38:33.524
Then I'll take your ears.

38:36.080 --> 38:38.287
Then I'll take your fingers.

38:39.560 --> 38:41.483
Then your fucking toes.

38:42.880 --> 38:47.283
See, I take your balls first,
you drain too fast like you fuckers do.

38:50.080 --> 38:54.290
No, I think tongue first. Tongue first.

38:54.600 --> 38:56.250
(MUFFLED GROANING)

38:57.920 --> 38:58.921
Tongue first.

39:02.600 --> 39:04.682
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

39:05.520 --> 39:09.411
If I take your tongue,
you won't be able to explain,

39:10.480 --> 39:14.963
and I want you to explain.
I want you to fucking explain.

39:28.240 --> 39:30.447
(TOMMY BREATHING HEAVILY)

39:34.920 --> 39:36.968
(CONTINUES PRAYING)

39:47.680 --> 39:48.841
Come on, Tommy.

39:51.720 --> 39:53.722
I forget who I am.

39:54.640 --> 39:56.130
I forget who I am.

39:57.240 --> 40:00.050
I'm a Blinder.
I'll take your fucking eyes first!

40:00.280 --> 40:01.281
(GUNSHOT)

40:06.680 --> 40:08.762
I heard the blackbird sing.

40:22.280 --> 40:25.363
And we let his wife
board the immigrant ship to New York.

40:26.240 --> 40:28.527
We didn't kill Mrs Changretta.

40:30.120 --> 40:31.406
And tonight...

40:35.320 --> 40:37.527
We're not those kind of men.

(SIGHS)

41:07.720 --> 41:09.529
You get rid of the body, john.

41:11.480 --> 41:15.246
Get rid of those for good.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.650
All gone.

42:03.840 --> 42:04.841
(EXCLAIMS)

42:07.400 --> 42:08.401
Oh!

42:44.960 --> 42:45.961
(SIGHS)

42:54.200 --> 42:56.521
Did you do what was on your list, Ada?

42:56.600 --> 42:58.602
You and your fucking lists.

42:59.360 --> 43:00.691
Did you?

43:03.080 --> 43:05.686
I spoke to an old friend of Freddie's.

43:05.760 --> 43:08.445
He's a Communist Party candidate
for Basall Heath.

43:08.560 --> 43:12.360
I asked him about the Birmingham branch
of the National Vigilance Committee.

43:13.880 --> 43:17.851
He said he'd heard the Soviet Embassy
was getting information from the inside.

43:18.480 --> 43:20.767
And? Has he got a name?

43:22.440 --> 43:23.566
Yes.

43:25.920 --> 43:27.888
Butjust promise me
no one will get killed.

43:28.040 --> 43:32.568
Ada, it'll be me or john or Arthur
who gets killed

43:32.640 --> 43:34.210
if you don't give me the fucking name.

43:35.360 --> 43:38.250
There's someone ahead of us,
and I need to know why.

43:40.440 --> 43:41.930
James Monkland.

43:42.800 --> 43:46.009
He's a Lloyds underwriter.
He's got an office on Curzon Street.

43:46.120 --> 43:48.327
Tommy, for fuck's sake,
who is it that's ahead of you?

43:49.720 --> 43:50.881
I knew I could count on you, Ada.

43:51.080 --> 43:54.243
No, you can't,
and I just asked you a fucking question.

43:59.080 --> 44:02.209
And I notice
you started wearing lipstick again.

44:02.960 --> 44:03.961
(scoffs)

44:04.680 --> 44:06.045
So what?

44:09.840 --> 44:11.126
I got bored.

44:11.200 --> 44:15.250
You can change what you do,
but you can't change what you want.

44:17.120 --> 44:18.326
And what is it that I want?

44:25.800 --> 44:31.443
There's gonna be a vacancy coming up
at Shelby Company Limited.

44:34.840 --> 44:36.444
Boston office.

44:36.800 --> 44:38.245
Boston, America?

44:39.960 --> 44:43.089
Lipstick. Clothes from Paris.

44:44.360 --> 44:46.249
No revolvers. All legal.

44:47.280 --> 44:50.409
Just turn a few heads.
Do the transit deals.

45:00.280 --> 45:01.884
James Monkland, right?

45:05.400 --> 45:07.368
Good night, Ada.

45:19.880 --> 45:22.451
- James Monkland?
- Yours, sir.

45:47.920 --> 45:49.160
Who the hell are you?

45:50.920 --> 45:52.001
What do you want with me?

45:52.080 --> 45:54.242
You've been passing information
about a robbery

45:54.320 --> 45:56.322
at the Lanchester factory in Sparkbrook.

45:58.000 --> 46:01.686
Are you Tommy Shelby?

46:01.760 --> 46:04.730
I need to know the name of the person
in the organisation

46:04.800 --> 46:07.201
that was giving you information.

46:09.040 --> 46:10.201
What organisation?

46:11.840 --> 46:13.922
The Economic League,
the Vigilance Committee,

46:14.000 --> 46:15.764
the Odd Fellows, Section D.

46:16.440 --> 46:18.204
They have many fucking names.

46:18.280 --> 46:19.520
Shit, shit, shit.

46:20.320 --> 46:22.402
Give me the name of the informant.

46:29.000 --> 46:30.570
Mr Shelby,

46:33.040 --> 46:35.202
they are very, very dangerous people.

46:35.280 --> 46:37.248
Oh. Hmm.

46:40.080 --> 46:43.527
Well, fortunately, so are we.

46:45.440 --> 46:47.408
You have to choose
who you're more afraid of.

46:47.800 --> 46:50.371
The Peaky Blinders at exactly 11:43,

46:50.440 --> 46:55.480
or Section D at some point
in the future.

46:59.200 --> 47:01.885
If you make the wrong choice,
you won't see 11:44.

47:04.080 --> 47:07.004
LINDA: Do they always have to do
the stock taking at night, Arthur?

47:07.080 --> 47:10.368
ARTHUR: Only 'cause, you know,
it slows down production.

47:11.280 --> 47:12.566
Thank you.

47:15.760 --> 47:16.921
Thank you.

47:30.560 --> 47:32.369
Night work will have to end.

47:32.520 --> 47:34.124
It will. It will.

47:34.920 --> 47:37.321
You'll have things to do at night.

47:43.360 --> 47:44.361
Yeah.

47:45.920 --> 47:47.684
I know.

47:48.840 --> 47:50.842
We've spoken about it.

47:50.920 --> 47:53.730
I was gonna wait until you had
a strong cup of tea in your hand.

47:53.800 --> 47:57.122
- Come on, then.
- But I'm gonna have a baby, Arthur.

48:12.560 --> 48:13.561
Pregnant?

48:14.680 --> 48:16.045
Yeah.

48:18.960 --> 48:22.726
You said you spent the night
taking stock. Well, so did I.

48:23.840 --> 48:26.605
This working at night will have to stop.

48:34.840 --> 48:36.888
- You'll have a baby.
- Yes.

48:38.800 --> 48:39.801
(CHUCKLES)

48:48.640 --> 48:50.324
- Oh, it's great news.
-(CHUCKLES)

48:51.120 --> 48:52.121
(EXHALES)

48:55.120 --> 48:56.531
Right, then.

48:58.600 --> 49:01.809
Let's have a cup of tea. One moment.

49:09.160 --> 49:10.161
(LAUGHS)

49:10.680 --> 49:12.921
Come on. Let's have that tea.

49:19.800 --> 49:21.325
Arthur, for fuck's sake, what is it?

49:21.400 --> 49:24.609
No. We wait for Tommy.

49:26.320 --> 49:28.004
I've got a stolen statue back there

49:28.080 --> 49:30.287
with its dick hanging out
waiting to be melted down.

49:31.160 --> 49:32.730
Tell us. Tell Tommy later.

49:32.800 --> 49:35.451
Yeah, look, he's not here.
He's not here. I'm going.

49:36.200 --> 49:37.247
- Hold your horses.
- There he is.

49:37.320 --> 49:38.685
- Bye, Curly.
- There he is.

49:38.760 --> 49:40.000
All right, what is it?

49:40.080 --> 49:41.844
Arthur's fucking giving us
all this shit.

49:41.920 --> 49:42.967
Come on. Come on.

49:43.040 --> 49:44.326
Right.

49:47.160 --> 49:49.447
Arthur, you got wire
on the fucking cork. Give it here.

49:49.520 --> 49:52.444
Bastard. Right. Gentlemen!

49:59.040 --> 50:04.524
Linda is up the swanny.
I'm gonna be a fucking dad.

50:05.040 --> 50:07.327
- Fuck off. (CHUCKLES)
-(ALL LAUGHING)

50:07.920 --> 50:10.207
Yes, Curly. Yeah.

50:11.200 --> 50:14.090
Arthur, I knew you had it in you.

50:14.600 --> 50:16.125
I knew he had it in him.

50:16.200 --> 50:17.406
September she reckons.

50:18.160 --> 50:19.685
Her tits feel different already.

50:19.760 --> 50:21.967
Yeah, that's not the only thing
that's gonna be different, brother.

50:22.160 --> 50:23.924
You're fucked now, man.

50:24.200 --> 50:25.884
Fucked. Absolutely fucked.

50:29.720 --> 50:30.801
Goodbye, Arthur.

50:32.880 --> 50:36.043
- I have a meeting I have to go to.
- Yeah.

50:36.760 --> 50:38.410
Yeah, of course you do.

50:42.400 --> 50:43.526

You go to, mate.

50:48.000 --> 50:49.604
Congratulations.

- Proud of you.

(DOOR OPENS)

51:31.240 --> 51:33.083
Your Highness, Mr Thomas Shelby.

51:37.840 --> 51:39.649
Welcome, Mr Shelby.

51:39.720 --> 51:44.044
I believe you've met everyone
apart from my wife,

51:44.920 --> 51:47.048
Grand Duchess Izabella Petrovna.

51:48.920 --> 51:50.410
Please, take a seat.

51:55.960 --> 51:58.088
Before we begin, Mr Shelby,

51:58.360 --> 52:01.364
we must offer you our sincere
condolences on your recent loss,

52:02.600 --> 52:04.125
which some of us witnessed.

52:05.480 --> 52:06.481
(TOMMY SNIFFS)

52:09.200 --> 52:11.806
- Did you drive, Mr Shelby?
- Yes.

52:17.160 --> 52:20.130
- They say you're an expert on cars.
- Yes, I am.

52:20.200 --> 52:23.488
I am curious.
What was your father's profession?

52:23.600 --> 52:26.763
Well, he told fortunes,
and he stole horses.

52:26.840 --> 52:30.083
Often, he would tell a man
that his horse would be stolen,

52:30.160 --> 52:32.686
and they would marvel at his powers
when it was.

52:38.960 --> 52:41.566
Before we eat, should we say grace?

52:46.360 --> 52:51.605
For what we are about to receive,
may the Lord make us truly thankful.

52:52.960 --> 52:54.849
- Amen.
- I'm not here to eat.

52:55.760 --> 52:57.171
I'm here to do business.

52:57.600 --> 53:00.251
What I have to say can be said
before the main course.

53:00.320 --> 53:02.004
Then I will leave you all
to your evening.

53:02.400 --> 53:07.884
Grand Duchess, I must apologise
for the bad manners of my compatriot.

53:08.040 --> 53:11.203
This is a report on the mission's
progress so fa r. (CLEARS THROAT)

53:11.440 --> 53:13.681
I've made only one copy for security.

53:15.240 --> 53:16.446
Who should I give it to?

53:16.520 --> 53:19.126
My husband
is in charge of this operation.

53:20.480 --> 53:24.485
But since there will no doubt
be vodka later,

53:24.560 --> 53:27.086
perhaps you should give it to me
for safe-keeping.

53:30.440 --> 53:33.011
Speak, Mr Shelby, while we eat.

53:37.320 --> 53:40.802
Five factory foremen on our payroll
have begun a campaign of victimisation

53:40.880 --> 53:43.531
against communist workers
in five factories across Birmingham.

53:45.240 --> 53:48.050
Anger amongst the workers will grow,
but we will control it.

53:48.120 --> 53:50.043
On the night ofjune 21st,

53:50.240 --> 53:52.811
a general strike will be called
across the city.

53:53.280 --> 53:56.762
Protests will develop into riots,

53:56.840 --> 54:00.322
and all police that are not
already under our control will be busy.

54:00.560 --> 54:02.050
The city will be paralysed.

54:02.640 --> 54:04.369
So how will you move the train?

54:04.440 --> 54:06.363
We have two locomotive drivers

54:06.440 --> 54:09.410
who've been allocated to drive
the midnight goods train to London.

54:09.480 --> 54:11.767
The armoured vehicles will be waiting
on flatbeds.

54:11.840 --> 54:13.729
- And ammunition?
- The ammunition...

54:13.800 --> 54:16.883
I have to say
that this soup is exceptional.

54:20.360 --> 54:21.930
Absolutely delicious.

54:22.880 --> 54:26.680
Ammunition, incendiaries will already
have been packed up and crated

54:26.760 --> 54:28.285
for transport to Istanbul.

54:28.360 --> 54:31.489
- And how long to London?
- The train won't reach London.

54:32.000 --> 54:35.641
All the goods will be unloaded
at a coal yard at St Albans

54:36.120 --> 54:37.884
and put onto Shelby Company trucks.

54:37.960 --> 54:39.849
From there, they will go directly
to the Poplar Docks.

54:39.920 --> 54:43.367
You Highness, if you're having
difficulty understanding his accent,

54:43.440 --> 54:46.808
then I can go through the plan with you
at a later date.

54:47.000 --> 54:48.843
If there is no ship waiting for my men,

54:48.920 --> 54:52.686
all goods will be dumped into the sea
before first light.

54:52.760 --> 54:55.127
What happens when they discover
the armoured cars are missing?

54:55.200 --> 54:59.364
During the rioting, the
Lanchester factory will be firebombed.

54:59.440 --> 55:01.966
A scrap metal dealer of my acquaintance
will declare

55:02.040 --> 55:04.202
that all the armoured vehicles
are in the wreckage

55:04.280 --> 55:06.044
and should be written off as salvage.

55:06.120 --> 55:08.327
No one will know
that they are in your possession.

55:08.760 --> 55:12.048
We formulated this plan
when we met at Birmingham.

55:13.360 --> 55:15.647
I'm certain that
nothing has been overlooked.

55:18.560 --> 55:24.886
This is the amount of extra expense
I believe I will incur

55:24.960 --> 55:26.724
for trucks and fuels.

55:27.520 --> 55:29.443
I trust you will respond in kind.

55:31.280 --> 55:32.964
But of course, Mr Shelby.

55:36.640 --> 55:37.971
Before I go,

55:39.160 --> 55:43.609
I would like it known
that I'm unable to swallow food

55:44.320 --> 55:46.049
in the same room as this priest.

55:50.400 --> 55:51.765
Enjoy your evening.

56:00.960 --> 56:04.043
Tatiana, see Mr Shelby to his car.

56:04.120 --> 56:05.531
Yes.

56:13.920 --> 56:15.445
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

56:33.440 --> 56:34.646
Walk with me.

56:58.040 --> 57:00.441
The priest is passing information
about the robbery

57:00.520 --> 57:02.204
to a Lloyds underwriter called Monkland.

57:02.280 --> 57:05.887
He, in turn, is passing information
to the Soviet Embassy.

57:06.600 --> 57:08.921
You want him dead?
I'll kill him, no charge.

57:10.520 --> 57:12.761
Why would the priest
pass information to our enemies?

57:19.000 --> 57:23.483
I'm being paid to act and to observe,
like a soldier.

57:23.800 --> 57:26.531
The complexities are your business.

57:26.880 --> 57:29.326
Go and speak to Izabella.
I trust her to decide.

57:33.920 --> 57:37.367
You were able to contain your business
dealings even after what happened.

57:39.320 --> 57:40.651
Perhaps you didn't love her.

57:48.520 --> 57:52.411
She's here by my side,

57:54.000 --> 57:56.924
and she says,
"Don't trust these people."

58:01.520 --> 58:05.241
Now give me permission
to kill the priest.

58:13.640 --> 58:15.688
