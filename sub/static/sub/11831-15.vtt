is premised...

38:10.395 --> 38:13.629
on the defense attorney
doing whatever he can...

38:13.695 --> 38:17.162
to get the guy off.

38:17.229 --> 38:19.095
It's drummed into us.

38:19.162 --> 38:23.462
We are bound by
the limits of the law,
but only the law.

38:24.695 --> 38:26.295
<i>Morality?</i>

38:26.362 --> 38:29.029
<i>Right or wrong?</i>

38:29.095 --> 38:31.195
Justice?

38:33.362 --> 38:35.829
If a criminal lawyer
starts asking himself,

38:35.895 --> 38:40.362
"What's the just result here?
How should we get to there?"

38:42.162 --> 38:44.195
he's lost.

38:48.295 --> 38:50.762
It's not a noble excuse,

38:54.595 --> 38:56.462
but a legal one.

39:06.162 --> 39:08.462
Do whatever you can
to get the guy off.

39:10.662 --> 39:14.729
Mr. Donnell says
that is the credo
of a defense attorney.

39:14.795 --> 39:18.195
Today he stands here
apologizing for it.

39:18.262 --> 39:20.595
Last year,

39:20.662 --> 39:24.195
after one of your clients
committed a premeditated
revenge murder,

39:25.162 --> 39:27.595
you stood
in this very courthouse...

39:27.662 --> 39:30.529
and argued law be damned,
morality should win out.

39:30.595 --> 39:34.262
Today you exalt the law
to justify immorality.

39:34.329 --> 39:36.795
Whatever you can
to get the guy off.

39:36.862 --> 39:38.629
<i>Face me, Mr. Silverman.</i>

39:40.662 --> 39:43.495
If a client
is about to kill,

39:43.562 --> 39:46.929
his lawyer has always been
allowed to reveal that.

39:46.995 --> 39:51.362
Privilege has never
been given priority over
the threat of bodily harm.

39:53.195 --> 39:56.395
Mr. Donnell knew that
his clients were violent.

39:56.462 --> 39:58.562
By his own admission,

39:58.629 --> 40:01.029
he knew of the possibility
that people could be killed.

40:01.095 --> 40:03.329
Innocent people.

40:05.029 --> 40:07.362
And he sat on it.

40:10.762 --> 40:12.629
He let the fathers...

40:13.695 --> 40:17.695
and the husbands
of those people...

40:17.762 --> 40:21.129
walk headfirst into an ambush
to their deaths...

40:22.095 --> 40:25.262
because in his mind,

40:25.329 --> 40:28.995
he had the legal duty
to ignore justice and morality.

40:29.062 --> 40:33.595
In his mind, if he did anything
to prevent those violent deaths,

40:34.729 --> 40:36.595
he'd be lost.

40:41.195 --> 40:44.029
I don't think
the defendant...

40:44.095 --> 40:47.595
has any idea how truly lost
he really is.

40:56.229 --> 40:58.962
How long?
She just asked us
to wait.

40:59.029 --> 41:02.062
She can't make him
stand trial for murder.
She just can't.

41:02.129 --> 41:04.195
With this public outcry?

41:08.262 --> 41:10.362
Come on, everybody.

41:13.095 --> 41:15.195
We'll be right outside.

41:26.162 --> 41:28.729
I'm not nearly ready
to put this behind me,

41:32.262 --> 41:36.195
but... I'm not ready to
put you behind me either.

41:42.395 --> 41:44.595
She's coming back.
Let's go.

41:49.195 --> 41:51.662
I called you back in
because I'd made up my mind.

41:51.729 --> 41:56.662
But in the two minutes
it took you to file back in,
I changed it.

41:56.729 --> 42:00.462
<i>Whether or not</i>
<i>you're guilty here,</i>
<i>Mr. Donnell,</i>

42:00.529 --> 42:03.695
<i>really depends</i>
<i>on exactly...</i>

42:03.762 --> 42:08.129
where you were in your head
when you talked to your client,

42:08.195 --> 42:10.829
what you knew
would happen...

42:10.895 --> 42:14.295
<i>or what you thought might.</i>

42:14.362 --> 42:17.295
Unfortunately for me,
as a judge,

42:17.362 --> 42:19.595
that answer still lies
within your head...

42:21.095 --> 42:24.162
<i>and your head alone.</i>

42:24.229 --> 42:26.329
On the facts,

42:27.229 --> 42:29.295
dismissed with prejudice.

42:55.795 --> 42:58.495
It won't be the last time,
It's never the last time
with you.

42:58.562 --> 43:02.429
All I'm saying is if we keep
defending the druggies, this
kind of stuff's gonna happen.

43:02.495 --> 43:06.229
Yeah, well, let's just get
some new clients before you
dump the old ones, okay?

43:06.295 --> 43:09.495

43:13.429 --> 43:16.195
