00:04.671 --> 00:06.605
Walter:
<i>My name is walter o'brien.</i>

00:06.607 --> 00:10.676
<i>I have the fourth highest iq</i>
<i>ever recorded: 197.</i>

00:10.678 --> 00:12.745
<i>Einstein's was 160.</i>

00:12.747 --> 00:15.280
<i>When I was 11, the fbi</i>
<i>arrested me for hacking nasa</i>

00:15.282 --> 00:17.750
<i>To get their blueprints</i>
<i>for my bedroom wall.</i>

00:17.752 --> 00:20.119
<i>Now I run a team of geniuses,</i>

00:20.121 --> 00:21.587
<i>Tackling worldwide threats</i>

00:21.589 --> 00:23.088
<i>Only we can solve.</i>

00:23.090 --> 00:25.057
<i>Toby's our behaviorist.</i>

00:25.059 --> 00:26.625
Sylvester's a human calculator.

00:26.627 --> 00:29.061
<i>Happy, a mechanical prodigy.</i>

00:29.063 --> 00:31.263
<i>Agent cabe gallo's</i>
<i>our government handler.</i>

00:31.265 --> 00:33.465
<i>And paige?</i>
<i>Well, paige isn't like us.</i>

00:33.467 --> 00:35.734
<i>She's normal</i>
<i>and translates the world for us</i>

00:35.736 --> 00:38.537
<i>While we help her understand</i>
<i>her genius son.</i>

00:38.539 --> 00:40.472
<i>Together, we are scorpion.</i>

00:41.708 --> 00:45.110
â™ª

00:55.622 --> 00:57.456
â™ª

01:04.831 --> 01:06.832
(door closes)
paige:
Hello!

01:06.834 --> 01:08.333
Merry christmas eve, everybody.

01:08.335 --> 01:09.635
Wow.

01:09.637 --> 01:11.603
Black sabbath instead of
"white christmas"?

01:11.605 --> 01:14.807
No way. Okay, we're all getting
into the christmas spirit.

01:14.809 --> 01:16.408
You know, we're kind of busy.

01:16.410 --> 01:18.410
Shocker. That's why I'm
bringing the celebration here.

01:18.412 --> 01:20.379
Tonight, we're going
to have dinner together.

01:20.381 --> 01:22.214
And yes, you have
to help decorate.

01:23.683 --> 01:25.384
So, ralph's a
little disappointed.

01:25.386 --> 01:27.286
Drew had to head to portland--
last-minute tryout

01:27.288 --> 01:29.121
For a minor league team.
Toby wow.

01:29.123 --> 01:31.824
That doesn't sound like him.
No, wait.

01:31.826 --> 01:34.093
That sounds exactly like him.
Drew wasn't happy

01:34.095 --> 01:36.595
About it, but they wanted to see
him throw before the manager

01:36.597 --> 01:37.830
Left for vacation
or something.

01:37.832 --> 01:39.832
Anyway, I want to soften
the blow for ralph.

01:39.834 --> 01:44.103
Gonna give him everything
this christmas except for snow.

01:44.105 --> 01:45.170
Uh, news flash.

01:45.172 --> 01:46.705
Ralph doesn't believe in santa.

01:46.707 --> 01:49.408
And still believe
in things that are magical.

01:49.410 --> 01:52.311
Oh, speaking of... Santa,

01:52.313 --> 01:54.246
I have your gifts.

01:55.348 --> 01:58.250
Happy, paige got us gifts.

01:59.886 --> 02:01.487
You didn't get me anything,
did you?

02:01.489 --> 02:02.688
(clears throat)

02:02.690 --> 02:04.289
No problem. Happy.

02:05.892 --> 02:07.626
Sylvester.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.162
And toby.

02:10.864 --> 02:11.897
Toby:
Oh.

02:11.899 --> 02:13.599
I miss my hat.

02:13.601 --> 02:16.135
It's on a cliff
somewhere in bosnia.

02:16.137 --> 02:17.703
Uh, this wrench
isn't functional.

02:17.705 --> 02:19.805
They're ornaments.
Now all we need is a tree.

02:19.807 --> 02:22.241
And I can't figure out
what to get walter.

02:22.243 --> 02:24.476
What do you get somebody
with a 197 iq?

02:24.478 --> 02:26.178
Definitely not this stuff.

02:26.180 --> 02:27.146
Okay.

02:27.148 --> 02:28.680
(whirring, bells jingling)

02:31.484 --> 02:34.686
I could have built
a better robot when I was five.

02:35.788 --> 02:39.291
I did build a better robot
when I was five.

02:39.293 --> 02:41.293
Well, thank you
for the gifts, paige.
Sure.

02:41.295 --> 02:42.828
You know, before my parents

02:42.830 --> 02:44.897
Shipped me off
to live with my uncle,

02:44.899 --> 02:47.199
My dad bought me a weight set
for christmas.

02:47.201 --> 02:49.168
Which is crazy because

02:49.170 --> 02:50.736
I'm big, not strong.

02:50.738 --> 02:53.438
Uh, try a foster home
christmas.

02:53.440 --> 02:54.873
They'd send me back
to the state

02:54.875 --> 02:57.176
A week earlier so they wouldn't
have to get me a present.

02:57.178 --> 02:58.911
Do any of you have
good christmas memories?

02:58.913 --> 03:00.546
I loved christmas.

03:00.548 --> 03:03.916
My dad would wake me early,
and we'd rush downstairs.

03:03.918 --> 03:05.417
Okay, now we're talking.

03:05.419 --> 03:06.752
Then we'd head straight
to off-track betting.

03:06.754 --> 03:07.953
It was magical.
The whole gang

03:07.955 --> 03:09.621
Would be there--
timmy no shoes,

03:09.623 --> 03:11.823
Smelly jim, pooter.

03:11.825 --> 03:13.192
They taught me
how, on christmas,

03:13.194 --> 03:15.227
You never bet the two
or the five horse.

03:15.229 --> 03:16.895
Nags put there for
superstitious suckers

03:16.897 --> 03:18.664
Betting on the twenty-fifth.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.465
Best of all, by the
time we got home,

03:20.467 --> 03:22.935
My mom would be passed out
on the couch from the eggnog.

03:26.973 --> 03:29.408
That was.. That was almost worse
than happy's.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.843
I've-I've never heard people
so jaded about christmas.

03:31.845 --> 03:32.878
I mean,

03:32.880 --> 03:34.613
Who thinks that way?

03:34.615 --> 03:37.249
While christmas has zero impact
on me personally,

03:37.251 --> 03:40.319
It does provide people
with, um, psychological uplift,

03:40.321 --> 03:42.654
Thus making workers
more productive,

03:42.656 --> 03:45.924
So the holiday
does have value.

03:45.926 --> 03:48.460
The point is to
be with family.

03:48.462 --> 03:49.595
That's what we're doing.

03:49.597 --> 03:50.963
Eating fat burger?

03:50.965 --> 03:52.798
It's not exactly
a holiday meal.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.634
Yours has bacon. That's
practically christmas ham.

03:55.636 --> 03:57.002
(chuckles)

03:59.572 --> 04:01.440
Walter:
That is just sad.

04:01.442 --> 04:02.841
Hmm.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.548
Excuse me. Hi.

04:09.550 --> 04:12.351
The wind's not striking the sail
with enough velocity.

04:12.353 --> 04:15.020
This produces insubstantial
pressure on the face, and,

04:15.022 --> 04:16.755
Consequently,
not enough upward thrust

04:16.757 --> 04:18.423
To counterbalance gravity.

04:20.560 --> 04:21.827
Got to turn your kite.

04:21.829 --> 04:23.562
Here.

04:23.564 --> 04:25.430
Thank you.

04:29.402 --> 04:31.403
Oh.
(laughs)

04:33.840 --> 04:36.575
How'd you know that?
I know a few things.

04:36.577 --> 04:38.644
Did you know
that ben franklin-- he...?

04:38.646 --> 04:40.445
He discovered electricity
by flying a kite.

04:40.447 --> 04:43.048
Had actually been struck
by lightning,

04:43.050 --> 04:45.550
The key would have
electrocuted him.

04:45.552 --> 04:46.918
It's just a myth.

04:46.920 --> 04:49.054
I like the way
you think, kid.
Woman:
Owen,

04:49.056 --> 04:49.955
Leave the poor man alone.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.290
Oh.
Owen:
Okay.

04:51.292 --> 04:52.958
Merry christmas.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.826
Yeah.

04:56.462 --> 04:58.530
(sighs)

05:01.067 --> 05:04.002
Do you think it's ironic

05:04.004 --> 05:06.071
That mom got you a kite
for christmas,

05:06.073 --> 05:07.406
And you never used it?

05:07.408 --> 05:09.374
Oh, that's,
uh, not irony.

05:09.376 --> 05:11.977
(chuckles): That's her
not understanding me.

05:11.979 --> 05:16.014
Yeah. You were never into
the holiday, even as a kid.

05:16.016 --> 05:18.317
It's because
I had more important things

05:18.319 --> 05:22.054
To occupy my time,
like the rohaxinal study.

05:22.056 --> 05:24.056
I pulled
some favors.

05:24.058 --> 05:25.390
You're in.

05:25.392 --> 05:27.392
I...

05:27.394 --> 05:29.461
I don't want
to be a guinea pig.

05:30.396 --> 05:31.530
Well, that drug has

05:31.532 --> 05:32.664
Some serious side effects.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.433
It could save your life.

05:34.435 --> 05:36.001
You've seen
the test results, walt.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.470
At this point,
I don't need a new drug.

05:38.472 --> 05:39.705
I need a miracle.

05:39.707 --> 05:42.607
There is no such thing!

05:42.609 --> 05:46.044
All right, do know how
jonas salk cured polio?

05:46.046 --> 05:49.981
With science, not by singing
about snowmen and reindeer.

05:49.983 --> 05:52.384
Well, sometimes you need
a little faith.

05:52.386 --> 05:54.619
I do have faith,
just in things that are real.

05:54.621 --> 05:55.987
(rumbling)

05:55.989 --> 05:57.089
Are we having an earthquake?

05:59.092 --> 06:01.993
It's a rock slide.

06:01.995 --> 06:03.028
Woman:
Owen!

06:03.030 --> 06:04.796
(screams) help!

06:04.798 --> 06:06.998
He's trapped!

06:08.134 --> 06:09.601
Oh, my god.

06:09.603 --> 06:11.069
(grunting)

06:11.071 --> 06:13.004
Owen's down there!

06:13.006 --> 06:17.509
He was in the cave, and the
bluff just started to come down.

06:17.511 --> 06:18.710
Owen! Owen!

06:18.712 --> 06:20.512
The ground just
opened up.

06:20.514 --> 06:22.047
He fell in. It happened so fast.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.782
Owen!
What do you mean,
the ground just opened up?

06:23.784 --> 06:24.950
It's a sinkhole.

06:24.952 --> 06:28.453
With small seismic shifts
at ground level.

06:28.455 --> 06:29.888
It's common in california.
It can cause

06:29.890 --> 06:31.890
A small, spontaneous hole,
especially in sand.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.058
Woman:
Oh, my god!

06:33.060 --> 06:34.726
He's buried alive!
No, no, no.

06:34.728 --> 06:35.994
Not necessarily.

06:35.996 --> 06:38.163
Sinkholes very rarely self-fill.

06:38.165 --> 06:40.165
There's a good chance he's stuck
in a hollow right now.

06:40.167 --> 06:41.733
We need the l.A.
Fire department,

06:41.735 --> 06:44.002
Army corps of engineers,
anyone that can help.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.470
Copy that. But who
the hell are you?

06:45.472 --> 06:47.072
(dialing)
I'm with homeland.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.408
I know some people.
We can help.

06:58.017 --> 07:00.752
Touch it, and you will have
a blue christmas.

07:00.754 --> 07:04.523
Walter designed it, sylvester
calculated it, I built it.

07:04.525 --> 07:05.991
What was your job?
Moral support.

07:05.993 --> 07:07.192
Sylvester:
Toby,

07:07.194 --> 07:08.660
A few weeks ago,
I was in a hospital

07:08.662 --> 07:10.095
Getting shrapnel
taken out of my chest,

07:10.097 --> 07:12.497
And I still did more work
for this project than you did.

07:12.499 --> 07:14.433
Grinch.

07:14.435 --> 07:15.634
Paige: Hey, guys,
walter just called.

07:15.636 --> 07:17.636
There's a ten-year-old
boy trapped in

07:17.638 --> 07:18.770
A sinkhole at zuma beach.

07:18.772 --> 07:19.871
Let's go.

07:21.207 --> 07:23.108
(siren wailing)

07:23.110 --> 07:25.811
Zuma beach is on high alert,
as a ten-year-old boy is trapped

07:25.813 --> 07:27.913
One and a half stories
below the earth's surface.

07:27.915 --> 07:31.183
Reporter: We have seen emergency
crews arriving on scene...

07:31.185 --> 07:33.485
Yeah?
We were listening
to the news on the way here.

07:33.487 --> 07:35.787
Okay. We'll start off by
getting you up to speed.

07:35.789 --> 07:38.156
This is dan heather,
army corps of engineers,

07:38.158 --> 07:39.491
Geotech division. Dan?

07:39.493 --> 07:41.493
Mind filling my guys in?

07:41.495 --> 07:45.630
Those boulders up here
are blocking access to the boy.

07:45.632 --> 07:48.967
He's trapped in a sinkhole
14 feet deep underground here.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.503
If we use heavy machinery
to move them,

07:51.505 --> 07:53.205
Ground shifts will cause
the sinkhole to collapse,

07:53.207 --> 07:55.173
Which means
we have no way to reach him.

07:55.175 --> 07:56.875
Oh, my god.
But it gets worse.

07:56.877 --> 07:57.976
We can't get in,

07:57.978 --> 07:58.977
But water can.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.512
There are gaps

08:00.514 --> 08:04.216
Waves are dumping down 30
gallons of seawater per minute.

08:04.218 --> 08:06.852
We're putting sandbags
to restrict the flow,

08:06.854 --> 08:08.687
But tide is too strong.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.088
The hole is filling up fast.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.189
Dimensions of the hole?

08:11.191 --> 08:13.592
Best guess: 1,100 cubic feet.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.594
Taking into account
the water displacement

08:15.596 --> 08:18.263
Due to an average-sized
ten-year-old boy, he will drown

08:18.265 --> 08:19.798
In one hour and 22 minutes.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.700
You can't drill
to him before then?

08:21.702 --> 08:23.869
A caltrans team offered
to help.

08:23.871 --> 08:26.705
They have the right drills, but
the sand is incredibly unstable.

08:26.707 --> 08:29.908
Normally, we'd drill
at a steep angle,

08:29.910 --> 08:31.843
But that could cause a cave-in,
killing him instantly.

08:31.845 --> 08:35.614
Instead, we're digging at a
shallow angle, farther away.

08:35.616 --> 08:37.215
But progress is slow.

08:37.217 --> 08:39.184
Doesn't help, this
entire bluff's unstable

08:39.186 --> 08:41.286
And could re-slide at
any time, burying him.

08:41.288 --> 08:43.221
Follow me.

08:43.223 --> 08:44.589
Where's his parents?

08:44.591 --> 08:45.924
Driving back
from up north.

08:45.926 --> 08:48.026
Bringing his grandparents
back for christmas.

08:48.028 --> 08:51.696
Speaking of communication,
we need a way to talk to owen,

08:51.698 --> 08:53.265
Find out his exact location.

08:53.267 --> 08:56.001
So you don't drill through the
sinkhole wall and impale him.

08:56.003 --> 08:59.638
We considered flying in
a high-tech sound wave device

08:59.640 --> 09:00.906
From nellis air
force base, but...

09:00.908 --> 09:02.207
Even an hh-60
helicopter

09:02.209 --> 09:04.543
With a top speed
of 195 knots

09:04.545 --> 09:06.044
Wouldn't get here
for another 86 minutes,

09:06.046 --> 09:07.979
And that's four minutes after
the hole would be full of water.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.314
The sinkhole is in there,

09:09.316 --> 09:10.315
Under that rock.

09:10.317 --> 09:11.616
No way the kid can hear us.

09:11.618 --> 09:12.851
No. I've got a way.

09:15.555 --> 09:18.189
Sylvester: Okay, walter,
I really don't feel

09:18.191 --> 09:20.091
Comfortable being in
a cave that was formed

09:20.093 --> 09:23.028
By a rock slide that happened
less than an hour ago.

09:23.030 --> 09:24.596
Oh, no.

09:24.598 --> 09:26.565
Guys, okay,
owen is right under there.

09:26.567 --> 09:31.069
But we can't dig a rescue tunnel
this close to owen, but caltrans

09:31.071 --> 09:33.572
Can auger an eight-inch
diameter tunnel

09:33.574 --> 09:36.341
Small enough not
to compromise the sinkhole.

09:36.343 --> 09:38.710
Use a collapsible mast drill
bit so if it accidentally

09:38.712 --> 09:41.313
Hits the kid's body, it'll
retract without major injury.

09:41.315 --> 09:42.347
In this soft sand,

09:42.349 --> 09:43.715
They'll reach
him in minutes.

09:43.717 --> 09:44.849
We need a pvc pipe.

09:44.851 --> 09:46.217
I saw some on the
caltrans truck.

09:46.219 --> 09:48.286
Okay, how do we
communicate with owen?

09:48.288 --> 09:50.255
Do you have some kind
of high-tech device?

09:50.257 --> 09:51.790
As a matter of fact, I do.

09:54.193 --> 09:56.328
Pipe is secure.

09:56.330 --> 09:58.797
If he's alive, we can
send scuba gear down

09:58.799 --> 10:01.700
So he can breathe when
the water gets too high.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.368
All right. Get that there.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.303
Let me see this.

10:05.305 --> 10:06.938
(line ringing)

10:06.940 --> 10:07.906
Come on, owen.

10:10.076 --> 10:12.644
Come on.

10:13.946 --> 10:14.913
Hello?

10:14.915 --> 10:15.914
Hey.

10:15.916 --> 10:16.915
Owen. Owen.

10:16.917 --> 10:17.882
My name's walter o'brien.

10:17.884 --> 10:19.718
I helped you with your kite.

10:19.720 --> 10:23.254
Please, get me out of here.
Walter: We're working on it

10:23.256 --> 10:25.357
Now, okay, but it's gonna
take some time.

10:25.359 --> 10:26.891
Where are my mom and dad?

10:26.893 --> 10:28.760
I want my mom and dad.

10:28.762 --> 10:29.995
We're trying to
reach out to them.

10:29.997 --> 10:31.930
Put him on mute
for one second.

10:31.932 --> 10:33.832
That rapid breathing
and confusion--

10:33.834 --> 10:35.734
If he goes into shock, he could
pass out and slump down.

10:35.736 --> 10:38.003
And there's already enough water
in there that he'll drown.

10:38.005 --> 10:39.771
We need to keep him calm.

10:39.773 --> 10:42.841
Walter! I got
his parents.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.743
Uh, owen?

10:44.745 --> 10:46.645
Owen, we got your parents
on the phone, okay?

10:46.647 --> 10:48.913
Hold on a sec. Hi.

10:48.915 --> 10:52.017
Uh, now I'm gonna hold the phone
up so your son can hear you.

10:52.019 --> 10:53.385
(beep)
okay.

10:53.387 --> 10:54.753
Dad:
Owen, can you hear me?

10:54.755 --> 10:56.988
Dad! I want to go home.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.957
Dad: I know you do.
We'll be there soon.

10:58.959 --> 10:59.958
Where are you?

10:59.960 --> 11:01.660
Mom:
Sweetheart, it's mom.

11:01.662 --> 11:03.828
We're coming, baby.
We're driving as fast as we can.

11:03.830 --> 11:06.231
(beeping)
the phone's dying.

11:06.233 --> 11:09.868
Dad: Owen, listen, we don't
have a lot of time to talk.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.236
Don't hang up!

11:11.238 --> 11:12.837
Mom:
I love you so much, baby.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.272
Dad: Son, we're gonna
get cut off soon.

11:14.274 --> 11:17.342
We're gonna get to you,
and when we do,

11:17.344 --> 11:18.810
Mommy and I are gonna
hold you, sweetie,

11:18.812 --> 11:19.911
And we're never gonna let you...
(line beeps)

11:19.913 --> 11:22.847
Dad? Dad!

11:22.849 --> 11:24.949
Phone's dead.

11:24.951 --> 11:26.851
(crying)

11:26.853 --> 11:28.753
Guys, remember what I said
about keeping him calm. Paige.

11:28.755 --> 11:31.322
Owen.

11:31.324 --> 11:33.291
My name is paige. I'm a mom.

11:33.293 --> 11:35.360
I have a ten-year-old son, too.
Can I sit in for your parents

11:35.362 --> 11:36.995
Until they get here
and just talk to you?

11:36.997 --> 11:39.030
It's almost christmas.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.433
Do you decorate
your-your tree with, um,

11:41.435 --> 11:43.101
Candy canes
and ornaments?

11:43.103 --> 11:46.337
My dad strings popcorn.
We do, too.

11:46.339 --> 11:48.807
We make a super long one, and
we wrap it all the way around.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.308
Hey, he's doing better.
Keep going.

11:50.310 --> 11:51.943
What else do you do
for christmas?

11:51.945 --> 11:55.046
We... We watch christmas movies.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.214
Yeah?

11:56.216 --> 11:58.016
Something's off
with his breathing.

11:59.985 --> 12:01.853
Hey, owen!

12:01.855 --> 12:03.288
Listen, I'm a doctor.

12:03.290 --> 12:04.823
Tell me, does your chest hurt?

12:04.825 --> 12:06.057
Yeah.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.026
I hit a rock when I fell.

12:08.028 --> 12:11.329
Oh. Uh, would you mind
looking up for me?

12:11.331 --> 12:13.298
Ah, thanks, buddy.

12:13.300 --> 12:16.034
Listen, you're doing great.
Just hold on one second, okay?

12:16.036 --> 12:17.802
I put him on mute.

12:17.804 --> 12:19.270
He-he has distended neck veins.

12:19.272 --> 12:21.506
That's sign of a pneumothorax,
a collapsed lung.

12:21.508 --> 12:24.075
It's probably from a broken rib
piercing it; but we cannot

12:24.077 --> 12:25.777
Use that scuba gear.

12:25.779 --> 12:27.112
The compressed air
will kill him.

12:27.114 --> 12:28.980
And that's gonna be a problem.

12:28.982 --> 12:30.181
Because...

12:30.183 --> 12:31.316
I just realized

12:31.318 --> 12:34.252
When I calculated
how long it was going to take

12:34.254 --> 12:36.054
For owen to be submerged.

12:36.056 --> 12:37.455
I made a big mistake.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.057
I'm so sorry.

12:39.059 --> 12:41.126
What's the adjustment?

12:41.128 --> 12:43.228
We don't have an hour
and 22 minutes to save him.

12:43.230 --> 12:44.929
If we can't get him
out of there,

12:44.931 --> 12:46.965
He's going to drown
in 56 minutes.

12:51.070 --> 12:53.471
Tension is building
here at zuma beach,

12:53.473 --> 12:56.007
As we have learned
that ten-year-old owen cooper

12:56.009 --> 12:59.144
Has less than an hour until
he's completely underwater.

12:59.146 --> 13:02.347
Rescue crews are tunneling in
in an attempt to reach him

13:02.349 --> 13:05.016
And hopefully get him out
in time.

13:05.018 --> 13:06.417
We need this
done now!

13:06.419 --> 13:07.418
Going as fast as I can.

13:07.420 --> 13:08.987
There's no other option?

13:08.989 --> 13:09.988
No.

13:09.990 --> 13:13.158
Owen, we're gonna drill to you
and lift you out, okay?

13:13.160 --> 13:14.225
Just hang tough.

13:14.227 --> 13:15.927
You can't.
Paige: We can.

13:15.929 --> 13:17.996
Our team's handled
challenging situations before.

13:17.998 --> 13:20.165
No. You can't lift me.

13:20.167 --> 13:22.033
I'm stuck.

13:22.035 --> 13:23.134
What do you mean?

13:23.136 --> 13:26.037
A rock has my leg pinned down.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.039
Okay, just point the phone
at your leg, please.

13:32.278 --> 13:34.345
Happy:
Rock looks to be

13:34.347 --> 13:36.114
A couple hundred pounds.
Even if we get there

13:36.116 --> 13:39.250
How the hell do we get
that rock off of him?

13:39.252 --> 13:40.285
I'm cold.

13:40.287 --> 13:42.287
Please get me out of here.
Please!

13:42.289 --> 13:44.823
We're gonna figure this out.
Everything's gonna be okay.

13:44.825 --> 13:47.492
I'm gonna talk
to the fire department.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.294
I'm scared.
I know, honey.

13:49.296 --> 13:50.829
And you're doing so great.

13:50.831 --> 13:53.598
You... I'm so proud of you.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.034
Let's talk about
something nice, okay?

13:56.036 --> 13:58.102
Um... Do you like
christmas books?

13:58.104 --> 14:02.073
My son ralph's, his favorite is
<i>I want an alien for christmas.</i>

14:02.075 --> 14:06.177
You do? Great.
What's your favorite part?

14:06.179 --> 14:07.245
Paige?

14:07.247 --> 14:09.848
(sobs)
could I die in here?

14:11.851 --> 14:14.152
Owen...

14:14.154 --> 14:16.888
The people helping you
are special, okay?

14:16.890 --> 14:18.423
They won't let that happen
to you.

14:18.425 --> 14:22.293
Fire department is proposing
a last-ditch idea.

14:22.295 --> 14:23.595
It's not pleasant.

14:23.597 --> 14:25.196
Amputate his leg?

14:26.398 --> 14:28.399
We can't. The vibrations
from the bone saw

14:28.401 --> 14:30.969
Would collapse the sinkhole.

14:33.639 --> 14:36.174
We're up against the one thing
humans have never been able

14:36.176 --> 14:39.611
When half a million kids a year
were contracting polio,

14:39.613 --> 14:42.013
You think jonas salk
felt like you do?

14:42.015 --> 14:43.281
But when he hit
a wall, he shoved it

14:43.283 --> 14:45.550
Out of the way
and he kept going.

14:45.552 --> 14:48.019
I have faith in a lot
of things, walter,

14:48.021 --> 14:50.154
But I especially have faith
in you.

14:52.992 --> 14:54.993
You're right.
In-instead of thinking

14:54.995 --> 14:56.394
About how to move owen's leg,

14:56.396 --> 14:58.062
We should be thinking
about how to move the wall.

14:58.064 --> 15:01.232
Or, in this case, the boulder.
Thank you!

15:02.234 --> 15:04.569
Here, paige, paige, paige.
Owen? Owen?

15:04.571 --> 15:06.404
I'm gonna go off skype
for a minute

15:06.406 --> 15:08.573
To take a look at that video
I recorded of your leg.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.341
Don't go!
It's just gonna take 60 seconds.

15:10.343 --> 15:13.044
Paige: Owen, I-I want you
to start counting,

15:13.046 --> 15:15.013
And when you get to 60,
I promise we're gonna be

15:15.015 --> 15:16.247
Right back together, okay?
You can do this.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.116
I'll-I'll get
started. Ready?

15:18.118 --> 15:19.617
One, two,

15:19.619 --> 15:21.219
Three...

15:21.221 --> 15:24.022
Four, five, six...

15:24.024 --> 15:25.423
Good.

15:25.425 --> 15:28.059
You have 54 seconds.
Then I take that tablet back.

15:30.195 --> 15:31.562
Walter: Okay, we need
a device small enough

15:31.564 --> 15:33.498
To fit through
that tiny crack,

15:33.500 --> 15:35.533
But powerful enough
to lift that rock.

15:35.535 --> 15:38.236
As soon as they're done digging,
we'll bring in a car jack.

15:38.238 --> 15:39.704
Car jack's
a brute tool.

15:39.706 --> 15:43.241
To exert the exact amount
of force required.

15:43.243 --> 15:44.642
The rocks are so unstable.

15:44.644 --> 15:46.110
We disturb them too much,
one will collapse

15:46.112 --> 15:47.278
After the other, like dominoes.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.546
It'll crush him.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.081
The boulder appears
to be approximately

15:50.083 --> 15:53.718
We need to raise it
between 1.8 and 2.3 inches.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.453
Any less, we won't free his leg.

15:55.455 --> 15:58.122
Any more, the whole sinkhole
could collapse.

15:58.124 --> 16:00.325
1.8 or 2.3?

16:00.327 --> 16:03.628
Sylvester, that's almost
a-a 28% differential.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.163
It's the best
I can give you right now.

16:05.165 --> 16:06.965
Sylvester, we need...
We need better.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.433
(sighs)
what is wrong with you today?

16:08.435 --> 16:10.335
Get your head on right.

16:12.438 --> 16:14.706
Happy uh, we need something
like a micro-jack.

16:14.708 --> 16:17.709
I could build one with
parts I have at the garage.

16:17.711 --> 16:19.544
It'll go faster
with help.

16:19.546 --> 16:20.445
I'll go with you.

16:20.447 --> 16:22.313
Cabe:
What's the use

16:22.315 --> 16:25.683
If this kid's underwater by the
time they bring back this jack?

16:25.685 --> 16:27.285
I've already accounted for that.

16:27.287 --> 16:29.454
For owen to stay alive,
he needs to stop breathing.

16:29.456 --> 16:31.322
What the hell
are you talking about?

16:31.324 --> 16:32.490
I'll explain on the way.
Come on.

16:47.373 --> 16:49.440
Walter o'brien, agent gallo,
we've been expecting you.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.309
The ecmo machine
you requested.

16:51.311 --> 16:53.111
This isn't 40 feet.

16:53.113 --> 16:54.545
We thought you said 14 feet.

16:54.547 --> 16:55.546
No, 40 feet.

16:55.548 --> 16:57.081
Now.

16:57.083 --> 16:58.616
Walter, they're just trying
to help, too.

16:59.184 --> 17:00.752
(bells jingling)

17:05.124 --> 17:08.126
Find me a u-channel wedge,
a quarter-inch thread drive rod,

17:08.128 --> 17:11.062
A reinforced shoulder bolt,
and three steel lid stays.

17:11.064 --> 17:14.699
Then start with the other half.
Prepping the kiln.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.568
Uh... Got
the wedge,

17:17.570 --> 17:20.204
Uh, drive rod, and...

17:20.206 --> 17:21.272
Shoulder bolt.

17:21.274 --> 17:22.740
You know more than you let on.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.042
I watch you work sometimes.

17:24.044 --> 17:25.176
Thank you
for making this creepy.

17:25.178 --> 17:27.078
Now find the other parts.

17:27.080 --> 17:29.680
(drilling)

17:30.783 --> 17:32.383
Is it gonna hit me?

17:32.385 --> 17:33.217
It shouldn't.

17:33.219 --> 17:34.752
It won't.

17:34.754 --> 17:37.488
Just lean as far back as you
can, owen. You can do this.

17:46.131 --> 17:47.265
(quietly):
It's tight in there.

17:47.267 --> 17:50.168
This isn't a science.

17:50.170 --> 17:51.803
God help this kid.

17:52.738 --> 17:53.805
(gasps)

17:53.807 --> 17:55.506
Stop the drill!

17:57.476 --> 17:59.177
(whimpering)

17:59.179 --> 18:02.180
Man: All right, guys, I'm gonna
back this bad boy out of here.

18:02.182 --> 18:03.081
Come on. Let's move!

18:03.083 --> 18:05.116
(tires screech)

18:07.152 --> 18:10.188
We need some men up here! Now!

18:10.190 --> 18:11.556
(grunting)

18:11.558 --> 18:12.590
Dan:
Okay, we got it here,

18:12.592 --> 18:14.158
But explain how this helps us.

18:14.160 --> 18:15.726
We need to keep owen alive

18:15.728 --> 18:17.228
Until the jack gets here,

18:17.230 --> 18:18.596
But that's not gonna be
until he's underwater.

18:18.598 --> 18:22.700
His respiratory system,
which is what this is for.

18:22.702 --> 18:27.105
Membrane oxygenation system,
or an ecmo.

18:27.107 --> 18:29.273
Where'd you learn
how to do this?
On the internet.

18:29.275 --> 18:30.708
He's not kidding.

18:30.710 --> 18:35.246
We get the tubes and needles
in the pvc pipe, and then...

18:35.248 --> 18:37.682
We haven't even
started putting supports

18:37.684 --> 18:39.117
In the tunnel
we just dug.

18:39.119 --> 18:40.618
Until that's done,
it's unstable,

18:40.620 --> 18:42.887
And the risk of collapse
is substantial.

18:42.889 --> 18:44.455
I need exact probabilities.

18:44.457 --> 18:45.456
I can't give them.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.125
Okay, I know someone who can.

18:47.127 --> 18:48.259
Come with me.

18:48.261 --> 18:51.362
Paige, tell my mom I'm sorry.

18:51.364 --> 18:52.430
Why is that, honey?

18:52.432 --> 18:57.135
She told me not-not to go
in the caves, but...

18:57.137 --> 18:59.704
I wanted to find
the pink shells,

18:59.706 --> 19:01.672
The ones she likes.
Owen...

19:01.674 --> 19:03.341
It's my fault.
This is not your fault.

19:03.343 --> 19:04.775
It's my fault!

19:04.777 --> 19:05.676
Walter:
Paige!

19:05.678 --> 19:08.646
I need him to work out
some odds for me.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.882
I have no idea, but this child
is starting to break.

19:10.884 --> 19:12.250
I don't know
how much longer

19:12.252 --> 19:15.186
And it kills me,
but the tunnel is not stable.

19:15.188 --> 19:16.320
And neither is owen.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.222
(crying)

19:21.593 --> 19:22.760
That's it. I'm going in.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.395
Absolutely not.

19:24.397 --> 19:27.198
None of my men, not the lapd
or the fire department--

19:27.200 --> 19:29.467
No one has been given
authorization to go down

19:29.469 --> 19:30.735
Until the tunnel
is ready.

19:30.737 --> 19:32.336
I don't work for
any of those entities.

19:32.338 --> 19:33.638
I don't need
your authorization.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.506
Hopefully, I'll see
you in five minutes.

19:35.508 --> 19:36.641
Hopefully.

19:36.643 --> 19:38.209
If not,
who would've thought

19:38.211 --> 19:39.577
I'd be the one to outlive you.

19:41.213 --> 19:42.680
Okay, you guys

19:42.682 --> 19:43.848
Man the ecmo.

19:43.850 --> 19:47.818
Reporter: <i>As this saga</i>
<i>at zuma beach continues</i>

19:47.820 --> 19:49.587
<i>To unfold, walter o'brien,</i>

19:49.589 --> 19:51.923
A freelance contractor
with homeland security,

19:51.925 --> 19:54.926
Is heading down into the earth
in what can only be described

19:54.928 --> 19:57.228
As a very risky endeavor.

19:57.230 --> 19:59.263
Owen! Hold on!

19:59.265 --> 20:00.331
I'm coming for you!

20:00.333 --> 20:01.566
Owen!

20:02.534 --> 20:04.936
Owen!

20:05.904 --> 20:08.239
Owen.

20:08.241 --> 20:09.540
It's walter.
Can you hear me?

20:09.542 --> 20:11.275
The water's getting higher!
Hold on!

20:11.277 --> 20:12.210
I'm almost to you!

20:12.212 --> 20:13.611
Hurry.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.216
(panting)

20:18.218 --> 20:19.750
Please get me out of here.
Okay.

20:19.752 --> 20:21.285
You've handled
this so well.

20:21.287 --> 20:22.787
You've impressed me;
it's hard to impress me.

20:22.789 --> 20:24.255
Now, my friends
are working

20:24.257 --> 20:25.389
On a device to free your leg,

20:25.391 --> 20:27.325
So I will get you out of here.

20:27.327 --> 20:29.427
Now, you will be with your
parents for christmas, okay?

20:29.429 --> 20:31.629
Okay. Okay.

20:31.631 --> 20:32.964
But I won't be able to free you

20:32.966 --> 20:33.998
Before the water covers
your head.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.800
I-I don't understand.

20:35.802 --> 20:37.668
Well, you have to trust me.
I found a way

20:37.670 --> 20:40.304
For you to stay alive
without ever taking a breath.

20:40.306 --> 20:41.539
All right?
All right?

20:41.541 --> 20:42.840
Send it down!

20:51.750 --> 20:54.285
Owen, there's a machine up top.

20:54.287 --> 20:56.387
It'll take the blood
from your body,

20:56.389 --> 20:58.022
Add oxygen to it,

20:58.024 --> 21:00.024
And then send it back
into your blood, okay?

21:00.026 --> 21:03.294
It's used in surgeries. Only
you're special 'cause you'll...

21:03.296 --> 21:05.730
You'll be the first person
to ever do it while conscious.

21:05.732 --> 21:07.498
Reporter:
<i>We've been able to jump</i>

21:07.500 --> 21:09.367
On the rescuers' wi-fi signal,

21:09.369 --> 21:13.604
And we can now watch this
incredible drama unfold live.

21:16.808 --> 21:17.942
Walter:
Give me your arms.

21:20.879 --> 21:24.382
You're gonna feel a pinch
when I insert these needles.

21:24.384 --> 21:27.051
It's like a shot at the doctor,
only deeper, okay?

21:27.053 --> 21:29.053
One, two, three.

21:29.055 --> 21:30.054
(groaning)

21:30.056 --> 21:31.856
I know this hurts,

21:31.858 --> 21:33.024
But you're doing great.

21:33.026 --> 21:35.459
Give me the other arm.

21:35.461 --> 21:37.662
(whimpers)
all right. Okay, okay.

21:37.664 --> 21:39.530
They're in.

21:42.034 --> 21:44.302
(whirring)

21:46.838 --> 21:48.839
Cabe:
Can't believe this is working.

21:48.841 --> 21:53.444
I know from our ben franklin
conversation that you're smart,

21:53.446 --> 21:54.578
So I'm gonna explain
something to you

21:54.580 --> 21:56.447
That I know that
you'll understand.

21:56.449 --> 21:59.750
In less than one minute, we're
gonna be completely underwater.

21:59.752 --> 22:01.652
Your primordial brain

22:01.654 --> 22:03.854
Will tell you to breathe in.
You cannot.

22:03.856 --> 22:05.456
No matter how badly

22:05.458 --> 22:08.359
You want air, do not breathe
in once you're under, okay?

22:08.361 --> 22:09.727
That's how people drown.

22:09.729 --> 22:12.496
It's not gonna be easy,
but I know you can do it.

22:12.498 --> 22:13.998
I need to breathe!
No, no, no.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.466
Look at me,
look at me.

22:15.468 --> 22:16.467
You need oxygen.

22:16.469 --> 22:18.102
And these tubes

22:18.104 --> 22:21.739
You just have faith
that the science will work.

22:21.741 --> 22:23.407
I can't live underwater.

22:23.409 --> 22:24.475
Yes, you can.

22:24.477 --> 22:26.444
We all have-- in the womb,

22:26.446 --> 22:28.679
W-when we were
surrounded by fluid

22:28.681 --> 22:31.349
And oxygen got to us
without us even breathing.

22:31.351 --> 22:33.050
That's all this is.

22:33.052 --> 22:35.953
Okay? Now, I'm gonna
stay with you,

22:35.955 --> 22:38.422
I'm gonna hold your hand
as long as I can.

22:38.424 --> 22:39.924
And then it's
up to you.

22:39.926 --> 22:42.827
When I go up, I want you
to count to 15,

22:42.829 --> 22:45.563
And then knock on the pipe
so we know you're okay.

22:47.699 --> 22:51.502
After I get the jack
to free your leg,

22:51.504 --> 22:53.537
I'm gonna be
right back down here.

22:53.539 --> 22:54.972
Okay?
Yeah.

22:54.974 --> 22:56.040
So what are you gonna do?

22:56.042 --> 22:57.408
Knock on the pipe.

22:57.410 --> 22:59.043
Okay. Are you gonna breathe?

22:59.045 --> 23:00.044
No.

23:00.046 --> 23:01.545
You promise me?

23:01.547 --> 23:03.514
I promise.

23:03.516 --> 23:05.383
You promise you'll come back.

23:05.385 --> 23:08.419
(grunts) I promise you
I will come back.

23:08.421 --> 23:10.955
And I only state facts.

23:13.525 --> 23:15.159
Paige:
It cut out.

23:18.430 --> 23:21.432
Remember, go against
your instinct

23:21.434 --> 23:23.067
And do not breathe in.

23:23.069 --> 23:24.935
Okay.
I will come
back for you.

23:24.937 --> 23:27.004
I promise.

23:49.728 --> 23:51.562
How long has it been?

23:51.564 --> 23:53.197
Too long.

23:53.199 --> 23:55.433
After going underground
in an incredible attempt

23:55.435 --> 23:58.469
To keep owen cooper alive,
everyone is waiting, praying,

23:58.471 --> 24:00.938
For heroic civilian
walter o'brien to emerge

24:00.940 --> 24:03.641
From the tunnel with news
of the child's condition.

24:04.943 --> 24:06.811
There he is!

24:06.813 --> 24:08.679
Are you okay?

24:08.681 --> 24:10.648
Has he signaled yet?

24:10.650 --> 24:11.849
(panting)

24:11.851 --> 24:13.517
I got a cop

24:13.519 --> 24:15.886
Waiting in the cave
by the pvc, but nothing yet.

24:15.888 --> 24:18.055
We're coming up
on half a minute.

24:18.057 --> 24:20.891
Come on, owen. Okay.
(coughing)

24:20.893 --> 24:23.527
This is gallo. Anything?

24:23.529 --> 24:25.162
Cop:
Negative. Still no signal.

24:25.164 --> 24:26.864
We're at 40 seconds.

24:29.501 --> 24:30.968
Look at me.

24:32.804 --> 24:35.539
Don't blame yourself.

24:39.077 --> 24:40.978
Cop:
Agent gallo. You copy?

24:40.980 --> 24:42.680
What do you got?

24:42.682 --> 24:44.815
Three loud knocks, sir.
Clear as day.

24:47.252 --> 24:49.520
Give me that.
Give me the phone.

24:54.025 --> 24:55.526
Happy.

24:55.528 --> 24:56.927
Now, owen is doing his best
to survive,

24:56.929 --> 24:58.829
But we still need that jack.
How much longer?

24:58.831 --> 25:01.565
I'm almost done. Then another
15 minutes to get to you.

25:01.567 --> 25:02.600
That's at least 20 minutes.

25:02.602 --> 25:04.101
Not for us. We called lapd.

25:04.103 --> 25:06.270
Police escort, baby.
Oh, good thinking.

25:06.272 --> 25:08.772
(panting) but hurry.

25:08.774 --> 25:11.609
Okay, two minutes,
gold melts, and I mold it

25:11.611 --> 25:13.277
Into a thrust bearing,
and we are done.

25:16.214 --> 25:17.147
Happy, what's this?

25:21.786 --> 25:22.987
Don't look through
my things.

25:22.989 --> 25:24.121
You tracked down your father?

25:26.124 --> 25:28.893
In 100 seconds,
the gold's ready.

25:28.895 --> 25:31.262
So, over a minute to talk about
something very important.

25:31.264 --> 25:32.830
It's not a big deal.
I've been wrenching

25:32.832 --> 25:34.131
At his body shop
for the last few weeks,

25:34.133 --> 25:35.266
That's all.

25:35.268 --> 25:38.068
He's a mechanic.
I love genetics.

25:38.070 --> 25:38.936
Good for you.

25:38.938 --> 25:40.604
What was his reaction?

25:41.907 --> 25:43.741
You didn't tell him who you are.

25:43.743 --> 25:45.142
That is what the card is for,

25:45.144 --> 25:47.278
But I can't
seem to give it to him.

25:47.280 --> 25:48.946
Happy, you clearly
want to tell him.

25:48.948 --> 25:50.881
The card was a mistake.

25:50.883 --> 25:52.650
"there are no mistakes."
richard bach.

25:52.652 --> 25:54.752
"get out of my face."
happy quinn.

25:54.754 --> 25:58.055
There are two parents
racing like hell right now

25:58.057 --> 26:00.057
To get to a little boy
trapped in a sinkhole.

26:00.059 --> 26:01.959
And all three
want the same thing:

26:01.961 --> 26:03.727
To be with family on christmas.

26:03.729 --> 26:06.864
You have that shot, and you're
forsaking it over fear.

26:10.702 --> 26:11.936
(timer dings)

26:11.938 --> 26:14.338
Gold's done. Get the mold.

26:14.340 --> 26:18.242
Why are you here
instead of with your team?

26:18.244 --> 26:21.078
I'm leaving.

26:21.080 --> 26:23.047
Because you made
some miscalculations?

26:23.049 --> 26:26.784
That child is living
my worst nightmares.

26:26.786 --> 26:28.586
Claustrophobia--

26:28.588 --> 26:30.220
Fear of tight spaces.
Aquaphobia--

26:30.222 --> 26:32.089
Fear of water.
Achluophobia--

26:32.091 --> 26:35.159
Taphophobia--
fear of being buried alive.

26:35.161 --> 26:37.127
When I was on that
beach, I felt like

26:37.129 --> 26:39.697
I couldn't concentrate,
I couldn't calculate.

26:39.699 --> 26:41.999
I am useless to scorpion.

26:42.001 --> 26:45.069
Shut up. You felt like
you were down there?

26:45.071 --> 26:47.037
He   <i>i</i>down there.

26:47.039 --> 26:49.006
My god, sylvester,

26:49.008 --> 26:52.042
How do you live when you're
constantly scared of death?

26:52.044 --> 26:54.612
You want to go?

26:54.614 --> 26:56.347
Go.

26:56.349 --> 26:58.682
But you'll have to live with
what happens to owen,

26:58.684 --> 27:00.050
Knowing you could've helped.

27:01.886 --> 27:03.020
Or you could
stay strong for him.

27:03.022 --> 27:05.089
Stay strong.

27:07.092 --> 27:08.892
I've never been strong.

27:10.795 --> 27:15.065
Well, that's a "you" problem,
so figure it out.

27:20.171 --> 27:23.140
(siren wailing)

27:23.142 --> 27:24.141
Faster, grandma!

27:24.143 --> 27:27.177
I should have driven.
I have seen you drive.

27:27.179 --> 27:28.879
We can't save owen
if we're both dead.

27:28.881 --> 27:29.880
Hold on,

27:29.882 --> 27:31.148
What the hell's this?!

27:31.150 --> 27:33.384
(tires screech)

27:33.386 --> 27:34.918
Hey, what's going on?

27:34.920 --> 27:36.086
There's a truck accident
up ahead.

27:36.088 --> 27:39.890
We don't have that kind of time.
Toby, get us out of here.

27:39.892 --> 27:41.925
I'm driving a monte carlo--
it's not like I can split lanes.

27:41.927 --> 27:44.662
No. But santa can.

27:44.664 --> 27:46.063
Hey.

27:46.065 --> 27:48.198
I know this sounds
crazy, but have you seen

27:48.200 --> 27:50.067
The kid in the news,
the one stuck in a hole?

27:50.069 --> 27:51.935
Heard about it.
We're working
on the case,

27:51.937 --> 27:54.004
And that boy needs you to
give us your motorcycle.

27:54.006 --> 27:55.039
No time to explain.

27:55.041 --> 27:57.107
Get lost.
When you remember me,

27:57.109 --> 27:58.709
Remember me fondly.

28:00.945 --> 28:02.246
(grunting)
happy!

28:05.116 --> 28:06.717
Oh, my spleen.
(engine starts)

28:08.086 --> 28:09.820
Get on!

28:10.989 --> 28:12.156
Toby:
I'm so sorry.

28:15.026 --> 28:17.961
O2 levels are steady.

28:17.963 --> 28:19.830
He's not panicking;
this kid's amazing.

28:19.832 --> 28:21.065
Do you know what the odds were

28:21.067 --> 28:22.266
Of that weak tunnel
collapsing on you?

28:22.268 --> 28:25.169
42%. Which is a 58%
chance of survival.

28:25.171 --> 28:27.171
The odds are on my side.
Do the math

28:27.173 --> 28:29.873
All you want, but there's
a boy breathing underwater,

28:29.875 --> 28:31.041
Still alive.

28:31.043 --> 28:32.409
That's a miracle in my book.

28:32.411 --> 28:33.477
(rumbling)

28:33.479 --> 28:34.978
Another rock slide!

28:34.980 --> 28:36.747
Get out of here
before it caves in!

28:39.084 --> 28:41.985
(yells)
come on!

28:41.987 --> 28:43.353
This part of the ceiling's
about to collapse.

28:43.355 --> 28:46.090
Then the ecmo goes down,
then owen is dead.

28:46.092 --> 28:47.458
If that rock falls on you,
you're dead!

28:47.460 --> 28:49.193
(grunting)

28:49.195 --> 28:50.427
Move the ecmo!

28:50.429 --> 28:52.262
Took four people
to get it in here!

28:52.264 --> 28:55.432
Now get out of here
before that rock falls on you!

28:55.434 --> 28:58.268
Not until you move the ecmo!
I'll get help!

28:58.270 --> 29:00.904
I got it.
No, sylvester.

29:00.906 --> 29:01.905
(grunts)

29:01.907 --> 29:03.273
Sylvester!
I got it.

29:03.275 --> 29:04.908
Walter:
You sure?

29:04.910 --> 29:07.244
I got it!
All right. Okay.

29:09.215 --> 29:12.216
No, we can't wait
until the others get here.

29:12.218 --> 29:13.350
We got to move now.

29:13.352 --> 29:15.052
We got to move it,
come on.

29:15.054 --> 29:16.120
Come on!

29:16.122 --> 29:19.223
All right,
one, two, three.

29:19.225 --> 29:21.391
(grunting)

29:23.461 --> 29:25.229
I can't hold it much longer!

29:25.231 --> 29:26.864
Sylvester, it's breaking off.
Get out of there.

29:32.437 --> 29:34.304
(machine beeping)

29:34.306 --> 29:35.773
You okay, pal?

29:35.775 --> 29:37.241
Walter, we got
a problem.

29:37.243 --> 29:38.475
I'm okay.

29:38.477 --> 29:40.310
(beeping continues)

29:41.146 --> 29:43.313
Paige:
Oh, god. The rocks

29:43.315 --> 29:45.182
Pinched off the tubes.

29:46.251 --> 29:48.252
The tubing's blocked.
He can't get oxygen.

29:50.855 --> 29:52.990
He's dying.

29:57.162 --> 30:00.063
Now get your men to that
cavern and move that rock!

30:00.065 --> 30:02.065
What, get equipment over
those boulders, in the surf,

30:02.067 --> 30:05.135
It would take an hour.
He's suffocating down there!

30:05.137 --> 30:06.804
Reporter:
<i>With oxygen cut off</i>

30:06.806 --> 30:08.338
To young owen cooper, he is just

30:08.340 --> 30:11.141
Minutes now from total loss
of brain function.

30:11.143 --> 30:13.410
I'm getting him out.
Son, his leg is trapped.

30:13.412 --> 30:15.279
There's no way.
I can't let him die in there.

30:15.281 --> 30:16.480
Cabe:
Son.
Walter!

30:16.482 --> 30:17.981
Listen. Son!

30:17.983 --> 30:19.983
Get off of me!
Get off me!

30:19.985 --> 30:22.286
He's been underwater
for three minutes!

30:22.288 --> 30:24.254
He's only got
one functioning lung!

30:43.174 --> 30:45.309
(screaming)

30:45.311 --> 30:46.577
(gasping)

30:46.579 --> 30:48.946
(horns honking)

30:48.948 --> 30:50.614
Whoa! Who gave you
a motorcycle license?

30:50.616 --> 30:52.115
I don't have a
motorcycle license.

30:52.117 --> 30:53.116
Great news.

30:53.118 --> 30:54.284
Happy:
Stop crying.

30:54.286 --> 30:57.087
We're only 300 yards
from the beach.

30:57.089 --> 30:58.956
(horns honking)

31:00.592 --> 31:03.160
(engine sputters)

31:03.162 --> 31:05.162
Whoa.

31:09.500 --> 31:12.269
You got to be kidding.
We're out of gas!

31:12.271 --> 31:13.971
You know what, give
me that knapsack.

31:13.973 --> 31:15.372
I spent my childhood
sprinting from bullies.

31:15.374 --> 31:18.108
It's about to pay off.

31:18.110 --> 31:19.643
(horn honking)

31:21.312 --> 31:23.480
I promised him
I'd come back for him.

31:23.482 --> 31:25.549
I'm sorry.

31:29.254 --> 31:33.223
I've been banking
on the impossible for so long...

31:33.225 --> 31:36.193
For my sake,
I started to believe it.

31:36.195 --> 31:37.961
Toby:
Walter!

31:37.963 --> 31:39.396
We got it!

31:40.465 --> 31:41.598
I got the jack!

31:41.600 --> 31:43.667
Got it!

31:50.208 --> 31:51.942
You're about to risk
your life again,

31:51.944 --> 31:53.377
When the likelihood that
owen's still alive after

31:53.379 --> 31:55.178
Almost five minutes
underwater...

31:55.180 --> 31:57.247
We've seen worse odds.
No, we have not.

31:57.249 --> 31:59.249
It's not possible.
Cabe's right. The water

31:59.251 --> 32:01.218
Isn't nearly cold enough
to put that kid in a full

32:01.220 --> 32:03.186
Hypothermic state where
he might survive that long.

32:03.188 --> 32:05.289
I know.
And the brain
without oxygen

32:05.291 --> 32:07.090
Begins to die
after five minutes.
I know!

32:07.092 --> 32:08.592
I really don't
want you to do this.

32:08.594 --> 32:11.128
I know.

32:11.130 --> 32:13.130
The last rock slide completely
compromised the tunnel,

32:13.132 --> 32:16.500
Anyone who goes down there
risks being buried alive.

32:16.502 --> 32:17.401
He knows.
He knows.

32:17.403 --> 32:19.136
Son, why are you doing this?

32:19.138 --> 32:21.004
I made a promise
I'd come back for him.

32:21.006 --> 32:22.272
Are you scared?

32:22.274 --> 32:24.241
Yes.
Good.

32:24.243 --> 32:25.575
That means you'll be careful.

The head of the team

It is hoped that someone with
a 197 iq can shed some light

35:38.137 --> 35:41.271
On what exactly happened
in that hole today.

35:41.273 --> 35:42.572
Toby:
Miracle?

35:42.574 --> 35:44.608
It's more like the ecmo
artificially pumped up

35:44.610 --> 35:48.345
His organs kept going
a few minutes longer than usual.

35:48.347 --> 35:50.614
It's a million-to-one shot,
but not a miracle.

35:50.616 --> 35:54.417
Press is not gonna like it
when I give them that story.

35:54.419 --> 35:55.585
Guys.

35:55.587 --> 35:57.787
Some people really want
to see you.

36:01.759 --> 36:04.861
Hey.

36:06.531 --> 36:08.165
Thank you, walter.

36:08.167 --> 36:09.299
What for?

36:09.301 --> 36:11.701
For allowing me
to believe again.

36:13.337 --> 36:15.639
If you trust that drug trial,
I do, too.

36:16.841 --> 36:18.475
I'll do it.

36:18.477 --> 36:20.210
I'm gonna keep fighting.

Guys.

36:32.890 --> 36:34.391
(grunts)

36:39.230 --> 36:41.531
The entire drive down,
we prayed.

36:41.533 --> 36:44.801
We prayed for god
to do something,

36:44.803 --> 36:47.637
Anything... To save our child.

36:48.906 --> 36:50.907
He answered by sending you.

36:52.610 --> 36:53.944
And your team.

36:56.814 --> 36:58.381
Thank you.

Do you want to talk
to them or not?

Ah, they already have

38:48.392 --> 38:49.993
You okay?
Yeah.

38:49.995 --> 38:53.496
I just, I wanted to wish you
a happy holiday.

38:53.498 --> 38:54.998
I'll see you later.

38:59.737 --> 39:01.438
You look just like her.

39:08.846 --> 39:12.682
I knew who you were the first
time you walked into my shop.

39:12.684 --> 39:15.652
After your mother died,
I was lost,

39:15.654 --> 39:17.954
And I hit the bottle, hard.

39:17.956 --> 39:19.589
Still do.

39:19.591 --> 39:22.892
You were so special.

Deserved better than me.

40:19.450 --> 40:20.950
Okay. Touchdown.

40:20.952 --> 40:23.186
Oh, you got
your hat back.

40:23.188 --> 40:24.988
I'm back.

40:24.990 --> 40:27.090
Huh?
Look at this.

40:27.092 --> 40:29.192
This is awesome.
