00:19.492 --> 00:22.527
You look adorable.

00:22.528 --> 00:25.730
Ah, all ready for your big
field trip to the museum.

00:25.731 --> 00:26.731
You happy now?

00:26.732 --> 00:27.883
Very... thank you

00:27.884 --> 00:29.017
for volunteering to volunteer.

00:29.018 --> 00:30.585
Yeah, so we're even.

00:30.620 --> 00:32.686
Well, I've been a parent
volunteer for eight years,

00:32.688 --> 00:34.406
and this is the first
time you're doing it,

00:34.407 --> 00:36.791
but, yeah, fine,
we're even. (laughs)

00:36.792 --> 00:39.127
Great... so, how did you survive
eight years of being stuck

00:39.128 --> 00:40.428
with Mr. Frond?

00:40.463 --> 00:41.713
- Wine Thermos.
- Hmm.

00:41.714 --> 00:43.064
Get a cyanide Thermos

00:43.065 --> 00:44.266
since you're gonna want
to kill yourself

00:44.267 --> 00:46.368
because field trips are dumb!

00:46.402 --> 00:48.270
I agree... field trips are dumb.

00:48.271 --> 00:49.788
I remember being a kid,
going to the zoo,

00:49.789 --> 00:51.973
and sneaking off
with Warren Fitzgerald.

00:51.974 --> 00:54.109
We smoked cigarettes
in front of the zebras.

00:54.110 --> 00:55.710
Half-smoked.

00:55.711 --> 00:57.095
I didn't really smoke.

00:57.096 --> 00:58.880
Start your story over...
I just got here.

00:58.881 --> 01:01.399
Aw, you didn't care
about seeing the animals?

01:01.434 --> 01:02.901
It was a pretty crappy zoo.

01:02.902 --> 01:04.468
Yeah, it's a pretty
crappy museum, too.

01:04.470 --> 01:06.104
And we go there every year.

01:06.105 --> 01:07.772
I like it.
Me, too.

01:07.773 --> 01:08.974
The Sands from Exotic Lands

01:08.975 --> 01:10.492
exhibit is my favorite.

01:10.493 --> 01:11.776
Last year when I got home,

01:11.777 --> 01:13.111
there was sand in my crack.

01:13.112 --> 01:15.280
It was hands-on learning
for my butt.

01:15.281 --> 01:17.883
I bet we all have a good
Sands from Exotic Lands story.

01:17.884 --> 01:19.451
(groans) I'm already bored.

01:19.485 --> 01:21.286
Hey, sometimes good things
come from boredom.

01:21.287 --> 01:22.287
Like Gene.

01:22.288 --> 01:23.805
Thank you.
And Tina.

01:23.806 --> 01:24.806
Pow.

01:26.609 --> 01:29.160
Okay, people, take a look
at my buddy board

01:29.161 --> 01:30.428
and find your randomly

01:30.429 --> 01:32.063
assigned buddy.

01:32.064 --> 01:34.900
(both screaming)

01:34.901 --> 01:35.934
Okay, oh, uh, wait, wait.

01:35.968 --> 01:37.569
Hey, hey.

01:37.570 --> 01:39.838
Oh, look, Andy and Ollie
got assigned to each other.

01:39.839 --> 01:41.640
What are the odds?

01:41.641 --> 01:44.242
- Yay!
- Yay!

01:44.243 --> 01:45.410
And I got...

01:45.411 --> 01:47.128
Me. (laughs)

01:47.129 --> 01:48.663
I got a Genie in a bottle.

01:48.664 --> 01:50.432
Hey, if I rub you, will
you give me a wish?

01:50.433 --> 01:52.534
- No.
- Hey, I heard you can see boobies

01:52.535 --> 01:54.469
from all around the
world in this museum

01:54.470 --> 01:55.804
if you know where to look.

01:55.805 --> 01:57.305
We're going on a booby bender.

01:57.306 --> 01:59.608
Boobity-boobity-a-la-la-la.
(giggling)

01:59.609 --> 02:01.610
(makes fart sound)
This I could get used to.

02:01.611 --> 02:02.877
Deedlup.

02:02.878 --> 02:04.379
Rudolph Steiblitz?

02:04.380 --> 02:06.181
Wait, is that Regular-Sized Rudy

02:06.182 --> 02:07.349
or Pocket-Sized Rudy?

02:07.350 --> 02:08.350
Regular-Sized Rudy.

02:08.351 --> 02:09.951
Oh, thank God.

02:09.952 --> 02:11.519
POCKET-SIZED RUDY:
Hey, what's the big idea?

02:11.520 --> 02:13.655
Geez, Rudy, quit
sneaking up on people.

02:13.656 --> 02:15.056
Wear a bell.

02:15.057 --> 02:16.358
God, I have Henry Haber...

02:16.359 --> 02:17.525
the school weirdo.

02:17.526 --> 02:19.294
Great, I have Tina Belcher.

02:19.295 --> 02:22.013
The dorkiest girl in the school.
(both groan)

02:22.048 --> 02:23.531
You know what?

02:23.532 --> 02:25.050
Maybe I'll show him
how to be cooler.

02:25.051 --> 02:26.851
People used to think
I was a weirdo, too.

02:26.852 --> 02:28.670
You know what? Maybe
she just needs someone

02:28.671 --> 02:29.971
to show her how to be cool.

02:29.972 --> 02:32.040
People used to say
I was a dork, too.

02:32.041 --> 02:33.291
BOTH: This'll be fun.

02:33.292 --> 02:35.026
TEDDY: <i>So, where's Bob today?</i>

02:35.027 --> 02:36.661
On a field trip with the kids.

02:36.662 --> 02:37.796
At the museum.

02:37.797 --> 02:39.064
I guilted him into going.

02:39.065 --> 02:40.832
You miss him, huh?
The thing is,

02:40.833 --> 02:42.000
he's still here.

02:42.001 --> 02:43.301
Don't you see?
He's me.

02:43.302 --> 02:44.970
He's you, he's that spatula.

02:44.971 --> 02:46.905
- Aw.
- Sure, it's a crappy restaurant

02:46.906 --> 02:49.407
and people walk right by
it, never take notice.

02:49.408 --> 02:50.842
- Wait, what?
- The floor's always sticky.

02:50.843 --> 02:52.043
Sticky?

02:52.044 --> 02:53.478
But it's home for a lot of folks.

02:53.479 --> 02:55.413
I'm getting choked up here.

02:55.414 --> 02:56.881
Okay... the thing is,

02:56.882 --> 02:58.583
now that I made Bob go,

02:58.584 --> 03:00.552
I feel like those kids
don't need me anymore.

03:00.553 --> 03:03.716
Now he gets to play mama bird.
Singing the songs on the bus...

03:03.717 --> 03:05.223
- Linda.
- Holding hands...

03:05.224 --> 03:06.658
- Linda, what are you doing here?
- What? What?

03:06.659 --> 03:07.692
Go to them!

03:07.693 --> 03:09.394
Oh, oh!
Go to the museum.

03:09.395 --> 03:11.062
Be with your babies, go to them!

03:11.063 --> 03:12.497
I got to go, I got to go!

03:12.498 --> 03:13.631
We'll be fine.
I'm waiting on...

03:13.683 --> 03:15.033
on fries.
Lock the door, Linda!

03:15.034 --> 03:16.101
Get out!
Why are we going?

03:16.102 --> 03:17.218
- Lock the door.
- Go!

03:17.219 --> 03:19.950
Never look back, never look back!

03:23.109 --> 03:25.944
What you drawing there, Henry?

03:25.945 --> 03:29.064
I'm designing robot characters
for my next graphic novel.

03:29.065 --> 03:30.565
It's part of a series.

03:30.566 --> 03:32.400
It's important to have interests,

03:32.401 --> 03:35.787
but maybe you can find
one a little less dorky?

03:35.788 --> 03:37.739
Uh, it's actually pretty cool.

03:37.740 --> 03:39.457
Maybe you just don't understand it?

03:39.458 --> 03:41.126
Oh, I understand it.

03:41.127 --> 03:43.578
There's 17 installments, and
you really need to read them

03:43.579 --> 03:45.947
in order, which you haven't,
so I doubt it.

03:45.948 --> 03:49.067
BOTH: <i>This is going to
be harder than I thought.</i>

03:49.101 --> 03:51.536
TINA: <i>Robots? But that
does give me an idea</i>

03:51.537 --> 03:55.040
<i>for my next erotic
fan fiction: Ro-butts.</i>

03:55.041 --> 03:56.224
(metal clanging)

03:56.225 --> 03:57.392
Hey, what's that noise?

03:57.393 --> 03:58.927
My cymbals... you never know when

03:58.928 --> 04:00.562
somebody's gonna want to jam.

04:00.563 --> 04:02.764
Hmm, back me up
with those, would you?

04:02.765 --> 04:03.798
Well, okay, but I haven't...

04:03.799 --> 04:04.966
Hey, Mr. Frond.

04:04.967 --> 04:06.484
Why did the chicken cross the road?

04:06.485 --> 04:08.069
I don't know, Louise, why?

04:08.070 --> 04:09.971
So he would be
in a different school district

04:09.972 --> 04:12.107
where there's a different
guidance counselor.

04:12.108 --> 04:13.575
- Hiya!
- Yeah!

04:13.576 --> 04:14.576
- Louise.
- What?

04:14.577 --> 04:15.944
Don't say that here.

04:15.945 --> 04:17.495
That's fine...
I'm out of material.

04:21.166 --> 04:23.468
Ooh, is there a rat exhibit?

04:23.502 --> 04:25.303
I think those are picketers.
Picketers?

04:25.337 --> 04:27.238
Even the people who
get paid to go in there

04:27.239 --> 04:28.406
don't want to be in there!

04:28.407 --> 04:30.842
That's how terrible it is!

04:30.843 --> 04:32.293
It's a good thing
your mom isn't here.

04:32.294 --> 04:34.195
Why, Mom likes protesting?

04:34.196 --> 04:35.964
What? No, she loves chanting.

04:35.965 --> 04:37.265
Oh, who doesn't?

04:37.266 --> 04:38.933
Yah, tah, yah-tah-tah!

04:38.934 --> 04:41.603
Hi, Madeline Greenberg,
museum director.

04:41.604 --> 04:43.438
Phillip Frond,
counselor of children,

04:43.439 --> 04:44.706
friend of the museum.

04:44.707 --> 04:46.341
I'm Bob, I, uh...

04:46.342 --> 04:48.276
He's merely a volunteer.
Oh.

04:48.277 --> 04:50.044
Well, you may have
noticed, we're having

04:50.045 --> 04:52.113
a little trouble with the UFMWD?

04:52.114 --> 04:53.481
I've had problems with that.

04:53.482 --> 04:55.016
Drink some cranberry juice.

04:55.017 --> 04:57.051
Hmm, no, it's the United Federation

04:57.052 --> 04:58.686
of Museum Workers and Docents.

04:58.687 --> 05:00.555
They're on strike.
Oh, like how my stepmom's

05:00.556 --> 05:03.691
on a sex strike
till my dad fixes the VCR.

05:03.726 --> 05:05.794
Exactly, it hasn't affected much.

05:05.795 --> 05:08.363
We still have all the exhibits,
all the fun,

05:08.364 --> 05:09.831
just one-eighth of the staff.

05:09.832 --> 05:12.400
(laughs)

05:12.401 --> 05:13.668
LOUISE: An Amazon exhibit?

05:13.669 --> 05:15.003
Maybe this day

05:15.037 --> 05:16.521
won't suck so bad after all.

05:16.522 --> 05:17.555
Oh, that's not open.

05:17.556 --> 05:18.840
What?! No!

05:18.841 --> 05:20.642
The strike slowed us
down there a little.

05:20.643 --> 05:22.026
(mumbles)

05:22.027 --> 05:23.377
HENRY AND TINA: Whoa.

05:23.378 --> 05:25.063
Nice plesiosaur.
Nice horses.

05:25.064 --> 05:26.681
What'd you say?
Plesiosaur.

05:26.682 --> 05:27.882
The coolest dinosaur.

05:27.883 --> 05:29.317
Hmm... Henry, it's great

05:29.318 --> 05:30.819
that you have a favorite animal,

05:30.820 --> 05:32.737
but what about picking
a cooler animal?

05:32.738 --> 05:34.656
Like a horse or miniature horse?

05:34.657 --> 05:35.990
Uh...

05:35.991 --> 05:36.991
It's your first time

05:36.992 --> 05:38.243
as a parent volunteer, Bob.

05:38.244 --> 05:39.694
Linda's set the bar pretty high.

05:39.695 --> 05:41.029
I hope you're up to it.

05:41.030 --> 05:42.247
With great vest

05:42.248 --> 05:44.332
comes great responsibility.
Ugh.

05:44.333 --> 05:45.984
Okay, kids, stick with your buddy

05:45.985 --> 05:47.819
and stay with the group!

05:47.820 --> 05:49.554
You don't want to be
a Missing Marvin

05:49.555 --> 05:51.856
or a Walk-Away Wendy!

05:51.857 --> 05:54.959
Ugh... huh?

05:54.994 --> 05:57.562
Okay, Regular-Sized
Rudy, change of plans.

05:57.563 --> 05:59.848
I'm going in there, and
you're coming with me.

05:59.849 --> 06:02.083
Yeah, I don't think
we're allowed to do that...

06:02.084 --> 06:03.952
- Oh, we're not.
- Oh.

06:03.953 --> 06:05.220
We're going
where no Wagstaff student

06:05.221 --> 06:07.722
has ever gone: The Amazon!

06:07.723 --> 06:10.708
Rudy, just keep your voice down.

06:13.612 --> 06:15.530
Oh...

06:17.032 --> 06:18.032
Amazon?

06:18.033 --> 06:19.634
Yes, ma'am-azon!

06:19.635 --> 06:21.269
- Ha!
- Shush! Shush!

06:21.270 --> 06:23.713
(whispering):
Sorry. Yes, ma'am-azon.

06:25.885 --> 06:29.406
I'm glad you're up for this,
<i>Rudy. I thought I was gonna</i>

06:29.407 --> 06:31.241
- have to get a buddy-ectomy.
- Are you kidding? This is great.

06:31.242 --> 06:32.709
I've never done anything like this.

06:32.710 --> 06:34.928
My mom barely let me go
on this field trip.

06:34.929 --> 06:36.713
(clanging) Ugh!

06:36.747 --> 06:38.181
Okay, I know you're new here,

06:38.182 --> 06:39.416
but this isn't how sneaking works.

06:39.417 --> 06:41.601
- You have to ditch the backpack.
- Yeah, sure.

06:41.602 --> 06:44.037
No! (cymbals crash)
I didn't mean throw it.

06:44.038 --> 06:45.172
That was loud.

06:45.173 --> 06:46.540
Okay, I'll show you the ropes,

06:46.541 --> 06:48.208
and then we're gonna
go under the ropes

06:48.209 --> 06:51.094
- and touch all the stuff.
- Yeah.

06:51.112 --> 06:53.196
♪

06:54.615 --> 06:56.599
I need to blow my nose.

06:56.600 --> 06:57.751
Uh, okay.

06:57.785 --> 07:00.554
- I can only blow it if you hold it.
- Ugh.

07:00.555 --> 07:02.589
(moaning)

07:02.590 --> 07:03.757
(grunts)

07:03.791 --> 07:05.258
Now me.
Oh, my God.

07:05.259 --> 07:07.127
(blows nose) Bob? Time for

07:07.128 --> 07:08.695
a head count.
Uh... oh.

07:08.696 --> 07:10.630
Four, eight, ten,
(nose blowing continues)

07:10.631 --> 07:12.215
14, 16...

07:12.216 --> 07:14.067
I'm gonna push you now, Ollie.

07:14.068 --> 07:15.318
I'm gonna push you away now.

07:15.319 --> 07:16.419
I understand.

07:16.420 --> 07:18.088
Uh, uh, okay, who's missing?

07:18.089 --> 07:20.223
Oh, man. Louise.
Figures.

07:20.258 --> 07:21.258
A-Are we good?

07:21.259 --> 07:22.325
Uh, uh-huh. Yeah.

07:22.326 --> 07:23.727
Definitely.
I just got to go

07:23.728 --> 07:24.895
over here for a second.

07:24.896 --> 07:25.896
Be right back!

07:29.901 --> 07:31.918
Of course she's in there.

07:31.953 --> 07:34.921
Louise. Louise.

07:34.956 --> 07:37.657
(animal noises)

07:37.658 --> 07:39.726
Louise, come out of the plants.

07:39.727 --> 07:40.827
(high voice): Who's Louise?

07:40.828 --> 07:42.729
I'm just a talking plant.

07:42.730 --> 07:45.899
My name is Leafy Greenbrier.

07:45.900 --> 07:47.467
RUDY: And I am Kate Bush.

07:47.501 --> 07:48.568
Listen, both of you.

07:48.569 --> 07:49.669
I know you're not excited

07:49.670 --> 07:50.737
about this museum,

07:50.771 --> 07:52.239
but I can't have you kids

07:52.240 --> 07:53.974
being Missing Marvins

07:53.975 --> 07:56.109
or whatever that stupid
thing Frond said.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.310
Walk-Away Wendys.

07:57.311 --> 07:58.311
- Thank you.
- Uh-huh.

07:58.312 --> 07:59.446
Um, what's your name?

07:59.447 --> 08:00.814
Regular-Sized Rudy.

08:00.815 --> 08:02.349
Regular-Sized Rudy?

08:02.350 --> 08:03.650
Why do they call you that?

08:03.684 --> 08:06.253
- Just look at me.
- Um, okay.

08:06.254 --> 08:07.287
Listen, you two are supposed

08:07.288 --> 08:08.421
to stay with the group.
Ugh.

08:08.422 --> 08:09.823
Dad, when I hear

08:09.824 --> 08:11.458
"stay with the group,"
I leave the group.

08:11.459 --> 08:13.159
Yeah, Louise, that can be annoying.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.794
All right, which way
did we come in?

08:14.829 --> 08:15.996
Uh, come on, this way.

08:16.030 --> 08:17.197
No, you come on.

08:17.198 --> 08:19.699
Dad, look around.
We're in the jungle.

08:19.700 --> 08:20.717
Ah!

08:20.718 --> 08:22.335
Can we just for a second

08:22.336 --> 08:23.937
walk around a little?

08:23.971 --> 08:25.805
Hmm. It is kind of impressive.
Yeah.

08:25.806 --> 08:27.807
But we both know
I have to take you guys back.

08:27.808 --> 08:29.109
You remind me of my mom.

08:29.110 --> 08:30.610
She hates fun, too.

08:30.611 --> 08:31.611
(whistling)

08:31.612 --> 08:33.179
Hide. Get down.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.931
Hey! Who's over there?

08:34.966 --> 08:36.499
Shh-shh-shush.
Somebody over there?

08:36.534 --> 08:38.201
Everybody shut up.
Hello? Come on,

08:38.202 --> 08:40.403
Jeff, you know I hate plants.

08:40.404 --> 08:43.206
Oh, they're gonna drop
their juice boxes when they see me.

08:43.241 --> 08:44.474
(indistinct shouting)

08:44.475 --> 08:45.475
Museum management

08:45.476 --> 08:47.043
is unfair and anti-union.

08:47.044 --> 08:48.478
Yeah, I hear that, buddy.

08:48.479 --> 08:50.146
No, no, we're protesting.

08:50.181 --> 08:51.181
What do we want?

08:51.182 --> 08:52.549
OTHERS: Fairness.

08:52.550 --> 08:54.017
WOMAN: When do we want it?

08:54.018 --> 08:55.652
OTHERS: Now.

08:55.686 --> 08:56.820
- Oof.
- What?

08:56.821 --> 08:58.088
The chant?
Well, uh...

08:58.089 --> 08:59.239
It's the chant, isn't it?

08:59.240 --> 09:01.007
Yeah. You got to wow 'em.

09:01.008 --> 09:02.709
Something like, uh...

09:02.760 --> 09:04.327
Give us more money, damn it!

09:04.328 --> 09:06.012
Or we'll shave the woolly mammoth!

09:06.013 --> 09:07.681
Give us longer breaks for snacks

09:07.715 --> 09:09.416
or we'll burn the artifacts!

09:09.417 --> 09:10.800
You're really good at this.

09:10.834 --> 09:12.002
Thank you.

09:12.003 --> 09:15.205
- All right, good luck, got to go.
- No, wait. We need you.

09:15.206 --> 09:16.740
Hmm?

09:16.774 --> 09:17.774
Remember, kids,

09:17.775 --> 09:19.676
smiling is the new touching.

09:19.710 --> 09:20.710
Nice.

09:20.711 --> 09:22.345
Also, if you ignore history,

09:22.346 --> 09:23.446
you're doomed to repeat it,

09:23.447 --> 09:24.781
and if you touch history,

09:24.782 --> 09:26.516
you will be suspended for six days.

09:26.517 --> 09:27.784
Yes... and when you get

09:27.785 --> 09:28.952
to the pioneer exhibit,

09:28.953 --> 09:30.053
learn but don't churn.

09:30.087 --> 09:32.722
Who are you?

09:32.723 --> 09:34.991
Is there a, uh...
Mr. Museum?

09:35.026 --> 09:36.726
No, there is not.

09:36.727 --> 09:38.228
Okay, booby checklist.

09:38.229 --> 09:39.596
Let's see what we got.

09:39.597 --> 09:41.298
Did you get that at the gift shop?

09:41.299 --> 09:42.299
Nope, it's my cousin's.

09:42.300 --> 09:43.550
He wrote down where to find

09:43.551 --> 09:45.085
all the boobs in the museum.

09:45.119 --> 09:46.853
Viking boobies, yeah!

09:46.887 --> 09:48.855
Eskimo boobies, coming real soon.

09:48.856 --> 09:50.757
It's an embarrassment of boobies.

09:50.758 --> 09:52.425
(Zeke and Jimmy chuckle)
Good one, Zeke.

09:52.476 --> 09:53.877
That's Jimmy Jr.

09:53.878 --> 09:55.729
You may not know
him because he's one

09:55.730 --> 09:57.063
of the cooler kids in school.

09:57.064 --> 09:58.098
Hi, Jimmy Jr.

09:58.099 --> 10:00.100
Hi, Tina.
(laughs, snorts)

10:00.101 --> 10:01.451
I know Jimmy Jr.

10:01.452 --> 10:02.619
Hey, Jimmy J.

10:02.653 --> 10:03.920
Hey, Harvey.

10:03.954 --> 10:04.954
Hen-Henry.

10:04.955 --> 10:06.256
He's always joking like...

10:06.257 --> 10:09.225
uh, not even my name, uh...

10:09.226 --> 10:10.760
(plants rustle)

10:10.761 --> 10:12.295
Okay, I think the coast is clear.

10:12.296 --> 10:13.530
Let's get back to the group.

10:13.564 --> 10:14.998
But we just hid from the guard.

10:14.999 --> 10:16.566
We're having fun here, ah?

10:16.600 --> 10:17.767
Come on, let's go
into the stilt hut

10:17.802 --> 10:19.736
just so we can say we did it,

10:19.737 --> 10:21.738
and then we can go back
to the boring group

10:21.739 --> 10:23.006
and that no-fun Frond

10:23.007 --> 10:24.958
and have a crappy day
just like you want.

10:24.959 --> 10:26.393
Please.

10:26.394 --> 10:28.194
LOUISE:
It's literally a hut on stilts.

10:28.229 --> 10:29.329
(sighs) Fine.

10:29.330 --> 10:30.463
Stilt hut and then that's it.

10:30.464 --> 10:31.598
Stilt hut!

10:31.599 --> 10:32.599
- Stilt hut!
- Shh.

10:32.600 --> 10:33.967
Stilt hut!
Shh-shh-shush.

10:33.968 --> 10:35.769
Rudy... rookie.
I know.

10:35.770 --> 10:37.604
(whispering):
Now we're all whispering.

10:37.638 --> 10:39.489
So nothing for you
to check off here, Zeke.

10:39.507 --> 10:41.508
They all have hair
covering their boobs.

10:41.509 --> 10:43.610
Like a stupid fashion
magazine, right?

10:43.611 --> 10:44.944
But not so fast.

10:44.945 --> 10:46.780
And three... two...

10:46.781 --> 10:47.947
ta-ta time.

10:47.982 --> 10:50.116
No nip, though.
Wow.

10:50.117 --> 10:51.651
Your cousin's really into this.

10:51.652 --> 10:54.387
I never heard of anyone
having a boob fetish.

10:54.422 --> 10:57.474
Well, this isn't
even remotely realistic.

10:57.475 --> 11:00.643
- I mean, the stegosaurus...
- Henry. What did I say about dinosaurs?

11:00.678 --> 11:02.062
Why are you talking that way?

11:02.113 --> 11:05.181
I'm just trying to help you,
Henry, okay, buddy?

11:05.182 --> 11:07.450
And I'm just trying
to help you, buddy.

11:07.451 --> 11:10.320
All I'm saying is, the
stegosaurus... it's obviously...

11:10.321 --> 11:11.321
- Uh-uh, honey.
- Huh?

11:11.322 --> 11:12.372
No.

11:12.373 --> 11:14.157
What a dork.
BOTH: I know.

11:14.191 --> 11:16.159
Whoa, whoa. You think I'm the dork?

11:16.193 --> 11:17.927
Of course.
Everyone does.

11:17.962 --> 11:19.929
No, no, no, no, you're the dork.

11:19.964 --> 11:22.465
Huh. Well, there's only
one way to solve this.

11:22.466 --> 11:25.068
Well, there's probably,
like, a lot of different ways.

11:25.069 --> 11:27.170
But why don't we
try your dorky way?

11:27.171 --> 11:29.706
- Yeah, well, 'cause it's not the dorky way.
- Can you just, it...

11:29.707 --> 11:33.410
drop the dork and just talk to me?
(sighs)

11:33.411 --> 11:35.512
You look so dorky right now.

11:35.546 --> 11:37.313
LINDA:
Make our paycheck more colossal!

11:37.314 --> 11:39.649
PICKETERS:
Or we'll poop on all the fossils!

11:39.683 --> 11:41.818
- Yes.
- Rude.

11:41.819 --> 11:43.019
Well, great stilt hut.

11:43.020 --> 11:44.020
- Yeah.
- The best.

11:44.021 --> 11:45.255
Now, let's go back.

11:45.256 --> 11:46.689
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:46.690 --> 11:49.259
The stilt hut was
my fun jungle idea.

11:49.260 --> 11:50.560
Now... what's,
what-what's one from you?

11:50.561 --> 11:51.861
What do you got?

11:51.862 --> 11:53.430
Um, go back.
Don't say "go back."

11:53.431 --> 11:55.331
Warren Fitzgerald
wouldn't say go back.

11:55.332 --> 11:57.867
Warren Fitzgerald would
say you've gone soft.

11:57.902 --> 12:00.003
Warren Fitzgerald?
From my zebra story?

12:00.037 --> 12:01.404
Yeah. From your fun past.

12:01.439 --> 12:02.672
I've got ideas, but...
I don't believe

12:02.673 --> 12:03.907
you have ideas unless

12:03.908 --> 12:05.141
you say them out loud.
Yes, of course

12:05.176 --> 12:06.376
I have ideas.
If I look around,

12:06.377 --> 12:07.510
I could come up with something.

12:07.545 --> 12:08.711
Okay, well, then look around

12:08.712 --> 12:10.046
and come up with something.

12:10.047 --> 12:11.131
Okay, there.
We're gonna go right there.

12:11.182 --> 12:13.550
(Louise chuckling)

12:13.584 --> 12:15.084
Look who's stepping up.

12:15.119 --> 12:17.020
But, uh, how are we
gonna get up there?

12:17.021 --> 12:18.254
We could fly.

12:18.255 --> 12:19.522
I know we can't fly.

12:19.557 --> 12:21.357
We could just do this.

12:22.460 --> 12:24.360
Huh? Who's soft now, Louise?

12:24.361 --> 12:26.196
Your stomach, your butt,
and your thighs.

12:26.197 --> 12:28.064
But nice work.
Let's go!

12:28.065 --> 12:30.667
(Rudy and Bob grunting) (humming)

12:33.336 --> 12:35.748
Mr. Softie just pushed over a tree.

12:35.749 --> 12:38.584
I like it. Hey, shake
a leg, Reg Size.

12:38.618 --> 12:40.619
(panting): I'll be right there.

12:40.620 --> 12:43.589
And Mom said
I'd never climb a tree.

12:43.623 --> 12:45.157
All right, race you
to the top. Let's do it!

12:45.158 --> 12:47.093
First one up gets to
spit down on the other.

12:47.094 --> 12:49.812
Don't worry, Rudy,
we're not gonna spit on you.

12:49.813 --> 12:51.697
(chuckles) As long as I'm included.

12:51.731 --> 12:53.115
Ooh, ooh. Look!

12:53.116 --> 12:54.116
Camel boobies.

12:54.117 --> 12:55.151
Those are humps.

12:55.152 --> 12:56.185
One man's hump...

12:56.186 --> 12:57.753
Okay, students, buddy up.

12:57.754 --> 13:00.156
In a few moments we'll proceed
to the hands-on room

13:00.157 --> 13:01.624
of the museum.

13:01.625 --> 13:03.242
Oh, finally! Yay!

13:03.243 --> 13:06.245
Sands from Exotic Lands!
Sand? Really?

13:06.246 --> 13:07.847
That's what floats your scrote?

13:07.848 --> 13:09.248
And then some.

13:09.249 --> 13:11.467
Mmm, the hands-on room.

13:11.468 --> 13:14.036
It's the one place
you're allowed to touch.

13:14.037 --> 13:16.839
(shudders) Your skin
should be its own exhibit.

13:16.840 --> 13:19.420
Well, your hair should be
sent to an Asian wig factory.

13:19.421 --> 13:20.443
Oh.

13:20.444 --> 13:23.202
- Who's a bigger dork, Henry Haber or me?
- You.

13:23.203 --> 13:24.663
- Henry.
- Not helpful.

13:24.664 --> 13:26.130
Bigger dork, me or Henry?

13:26.131 --> 13:27.149
- Tina.
- Henry.

13:27.150 --> 13:28.817
Well, looks like we're dork-locked.

13:28.818 --> 13:30.453
(sighs) We need fresh eyes.

13:30.454 --> 13:32.455
Hello, I'm Tina and this is Henry.

13:32.456 --> 13:33.772
- I'm Henry.
- (sighs) Yeah.

13:33.773 --> 13:35.641
Who do you think
is the bigger dork?

13:35.675 --> 13:38.144
Um, I don't think you kids
should play this game.

13:38.145 --> 13:39.979
Labels lead to hurt feelings.

13:39.980 --> 13:42.781
Sheesh. Never ask a dork
to judge a dork contest.

13:42.782 --> 13:44.150
Yeah.

13:44.151 --> 13:46.168
(pants) Come on.
Pick up the pace, softie.

13:46.169 --> 13:48.554
Softie? That's funny
coming from the girl

13:48.555 --> 13:51.157
who called me Daddy
until she was eight.

13:51.191 --> 13:53.692
What? That's crazy.
You better have a good lawyer,

13:53.693 --> 13:56.295
'cause that is slander, sir.
(wheezing)

13:56.296 --> 13:58.831
That's me laughing.

13:58.832 --> 14:00.833
(wheezing laugh)

14:00.834 --> 14:02.635
Time to kick it up a notch, okay?

14:02.636 --> 14:04.653
Boom, chaka, boom, chaka,
boom, boom, boom!

14:04.654 --> 14:07.323
OTHERS: Boom, chaka, boom,
chaka, boom, boom, boom!

14:07.324 --> 14:09.708
Weeda, weeda, weina,
weina, weina, wang.

14:09.709 --> 14:12.211
OTHERS: Weeda, weeda,
weina, weina, weina, wang.

14:12.245 --> 14:13.896
Shake your hips!
Wiggle your butt!

14:13.897 --> 14:15.181
Drop your pants
and pick 'em back up!

14:15.215 --> 14:18.334
- No. I don't want to drop my pants.
- Why?

14:18.368 --> 14:19.735
(pants) Ha!

14:19.736 --> 14:21.103
We did it!

14:21.104 --> 14:23.088
You know what?

14:23.089 --> 14:24.857
I <i>am</i> gonna spit.

14:24.858 --> 14:26.208
(hocks loogie, spits)

14:26.209 --> 14:27.910
Hey, I'm glad we ditched.

14:27.911 --> 14:29.378
That was fun.
Me, too.

14:29.379 --> 14:30.763
Let's do it again sometime.

14:30.764 --> 14:32.398
Like, maybe when
you're old and senile,

14:32.399 --> 14:34.233
I'll close the restaurant
and come spring you

14:34.234 --> 14:35.851
from the nursing home.
What?

14:35.852 --> 14:37.553
Sorry, I didn't want to do it,

14:37.554 --> 14:39.955
but Gene and Tina put you
in a nursing home.

14:39.956 --> 14:42.024
And not one
of the nice ones either.

14:42.025 --> 14:44.627
No, you said you'd be
running the restaurant.

14:44.628 --> 14:46.595
Oh, no, I was just saying...

14:46.596 --> 14:48.597
You're taking over
the family business?

14:48.598 --> 14:50.733
- (scoffs) Yeah, right.
- Ha!

14:50.734 --> 14:52.885
- Admit it, you look up to me.
- No!

14:52.886 --> 14:56.288
S... (groans) You are ruining
our perfect day right now!

14:56.289 --> 14:59.124
Oh, my God, am I your hero?
(groans)

14:59.125 --> 15:00.342
Sick!
(wheezing)

15:00.377 --> 15:03.546
Fun... hurts... my lungs.

15:03.547 --> 15:05.614
Wow. I thought I was out of shape.

15:05.615 --> 15:07.383
- MAN: What the...
- Oh! Shh, shh, shh.

15:07.384 --> 15:09.718
This doesn't go here.

15:09.719 --> 15:11.921
(grunts) Disgusting tree.

15:11.922 --> 15:14.256
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew!

15:14.257 --> 15:16.659
Whoa. That's gonna make
getting down a lot harder.

15:16.660 --> 15:17.660
Oh, crap,

15:17.661 --> 15:18.661
crap, crap.

15:18.662 --> 15:20.195
We're stuck up here.

15:20.196 --> 15:22.298
This was a stupid idea. (wheezing)

15:22.299 --> 15:24.133
Um, Rudy, are you okay?

15:24.134 --> 15:28.037
Haven't gone this long
(wheeze) without my inhaler.

15:28.038 --> 15:30.673
- Inhaler?
- I'm supposed to use it every two hours

15:30.674 --> 15:32.474
(wheeze) or I could die.

15:32.475 --> 15:34.810
- What?
- (wheezing): But I'm sick of that thing.

15:34.811 --> 15:36.378
O-Okay. Where's your inhaler?

15:36.379 --> 15:40.282
In... my... backpack.

15:40.283 --> 15:42.351
- Where's your backpack?
- Um, I made him ditch it.

15:42.352 --> 15:43.385
What?

15:43.386 --> 15:45.287
But don't worry about me.

15:45.288 --> 15:48.290
(inhales deeply)
I'm loving every minute of this.

15:48.291 --> 15:49.358
Oh, my God. Wait!

15:49.359 --> 15:51.160
Security guy! Come back!

15:51.161 --> 15:54.314
Help! Help!

15:57.810 --> 16:00.045
LOUISE: Why didn't you tell
me you need your inhaler?

16:00.079 --> 16:02.381
I'm your buddy. We're
supposed to talk.

16:02.415 --> 16:04.429
- We talk.
- This is why you can't just do

16:04.430 --> 16:06.618
whatever you want, Louise,
there are consequences.

16:06.619 --> 16:08.186
You shouldn't have left the group.

16:08.187 --> 16:10.155
And I shouldn't have let you
talk me into doing this!

16:10.156 --> 16:11.657
So it's your fault?

16:11.691 --> 16:15.460
No! Right now we just have
to get Rudy his inhaler!

16:15.461 --> 16:17.446
(wheezing)
How are we gonna get down?

16:17.447 --> 16:18.981
That tree was our ladder.

16:18.982 --> 16:20.515
I know that tree was our ladder!

16:20.516 --> 16:21.750
I put it there!

16:21.784 --> 16:23.785
(weakly):
I think I'm coming around.

16:23.786 --> 16:25.954
(wheeze)
I think I'm getting better.

16:25.955 --> 16:27.489
Nope! Getting worse.

16:27.523 --> 16:29.091
(gurgling): Getting worse.

16:29.092 --> 16:30.659
Oh. Oh, boy. Uh, CPR.

16:30.660 --> 16:32.227
I know how to give CPR.

16:32.262 --> 16:33.562
No, thank you.

16:33.596 --> 16:34.663
Uh, wh-why don't I just try it?

16:34.664 --> 16:35.781
And if you hate it, I'll stop.

16:35.782 --> 16:37.816
- No!
- Yeah, okay, you're right.

16:37.850 --> 16:39.801
Just hold on.

16:39.802 --> 16:40.986
- I have an idea.
- What?

16:40.987 --> 16:43.322
- Wish me luck.
- Wh-What are you doing?

16:43.356 --> 16:45.874
Maybe the bravest and dumbest
thing I've ever done.

16:45.875 --> 16:47.643
This is for you, Warren Fitzgerald!

16:47.644 --> 16:48.961
And you, too, Rudy.

16:48.962 --> 16:50.445
- Cool.
- Whoa!

16:50.496 --> 16:52.164
(Louise shouting)

16:52.198 --> 16:54.633
(screams)
Dad!

16:54.634 --> 16:57.486
(grunts)
Whoa! That was amazing!

17:00.006 --> 17:01.306
Hello, sand.

17:01.341 --> 17:04.343
You remember these hands?
(moans)

17:04.344 --> 17:06.744
We're finally done with boobs!

17:06.746 --> 17:08.964
Oh, Gene, you're never
done with boobs.

17:08.964 --> 17:10.132
They're everywhere you look!

17:10.133 --> 17:11.733
Mountains, speed bumps...

17:11.733 --> 17:13.919
Hell, you just made a nice pair
yourself, Cool Breeze.

17:13.920 --> 17:16.887
(shouts) You've ruined sand!

17:16.923 --> 17:18.757
TINA: Darn it.
We still haven't settled this.

17:18.758 --> 17:21.059
I don't get it. Why would
anyone think I'm a dork?

17:21.060 --> 17:23.494
- Well, what makes me a dork?
- Well, um,

17:23.529 --> 17:25.864
you're a dork for plesiosaurs.
And your comic book.

17:25.897 --> 17:29.167
Graphic novel. But, yes,
I also dabble in comic books,

17:29.168 --> 17:31.670
- action figures, and stickers.
- Yeah. See?

17:31.671 --> 17:33.505
Well, you're a dork for horses.

17:33.506 --> 17:36.275
Huh, I am. Among other things.

17:36.276 --> 17:38.744
Hmm. I guess we're both dorks
in our own way.

17:38.745 --> 17:40.846
Everyone! I have an announcement.

17:40.847 --> 17:43.081
You're probably all wondering
how the voting came out

17:43.082 --> 17:44.750
in the Tina/Henry dork controversy.

17:44.751 --> 17:46.218
OTHERS: No.

17:46.219 --> 17:48.120
Well, the verdict
is in. I'm a dork.

17:48.121 --> 17:50.289
For boys and horses and zombies.

17:50.290 --> 17:54.459
And I'm a dork for dinosaurs
and my series of graphic novels.

17:54.460 --> 17:57.245
I guess I'm a dork for dancing.
(grunting)

17:57.246 --> 17:59.114
Okay, then I'm a dork for sand.

17:59.115 --> 18:01.199
Guess that makes me
a dork for boobs.

18:01.234 --> 18:03.435
I'm a dork for Ollie.
I'm a dork for Andy!

18:03.469 --> 18:05.937
And I'm a dork
for bargain Chardonnays

18:05.938 --> 18:08.940
(quietly): And being asked out
by handsome guidance counselors.

18:08.941 --> 18:10.475
What about you, Mr. Frond?

18:10.476 --> 18:12.977
I'm a dork for getting
on the bus on time.

18:12.978 --> 18:14.913
Get your buddies and let's go!

18:14.914 --> 18:16.248
- (quietly): Call me.
- Oh!

18:16.249 --> 18:18.350
- If my mother answers, hang up.
- Oh.

18:18.384 --> 18:19.718
We might be dorks
for different things,

18:19.719 --> 18:21.386
but at our cores, we're all...

18:21.421 --> 18:24.790
the same. I made a very
good point. Let's all go now.

18:24.824 --> 18:27.492
Boys are from Mars,
girls are from Venus.

18:27.493 --> 18:30.495
I've got a yum-yum,
you've got a penis.

18:30.496 --> 18:32.130
Uh, Linda?
What? Ow. What?

18:32.131 --> 18:34.416
Uh, we've been talking,
and we want you to leave.

18:34.450 --> 18:35.884
Wha... (gasps) Really!

18:35.885 --> 18:37.285
You want me to leave?
Yeah.

18:37.286 --> 18:38.320
Well, chant for it.

18:38.321 --> 18:39.588
Oh, wait. I'm sorry.

18:39.589 --> 18:41.957
That's right. You can't chant!
Ha!

18:41.991 --> 18:44.926
(wheezing)

18:44.927 --> 18:47.579
How many pumps? L-Let me
read the instructions.

18:47.613 --> 18:49.348
Oh, what, you're worried
he's gonna breathe too well?

18:49.349 --> 18:52.351
- Come on!
- Fine!

18:52.352 --> 18:55.754
(inhales deeply, sighs) Thank you.

18:55.788 --> 18:57.089
(groans) Buddy.

18:57.123 --> 18:58.523
Oh, I hate you.

18:58.524 --> 18:59.958
But I love air.

18:59.959 --> 19:01.660
So I guess we're stuck together.

19:01.694 --> 19:03.261
- Let me get a puff of that.
- MAN: Hey! You're not

19:03.262 --> 19:04.830
allowed to be in here.
What's going on?!

19:04.864 --> 19:08.083
Uh, we're, uh... Run!

19:08.084 --> 19:10.152
- MAN: What do we want?
- OTHERS: Linda gone!

19:10.153 --> 19:11.753
- When do we want it?
- OTHERS: Now!

19:11.788 --> 19:13.488
Linda Belcher's here to stay!

19:13.489 --> 19:15.490
I don't work here anyway!
Boo!

19:15.491 --> 19:16.792
Oh, my face!
(jeering)

19:19.262 --> 19:20.779
LOUISE: Scabs!

19:20.780 --> 19:22.681
Scabs are coming!

19:22.715 --> 19:23.932
Let's get 'em!

19:23.966 --> 19:26.318
They'll do anything for a dollar!

19:26.352 --> 19:29.271
(panting): Did you come to surprise
us, but then you got caught up

19:29.272 --> 19:30.719
- in the chanting?
- Yep.

19:30.720 --> 19:32.774
Did Louise get you in trouble
with security?

19:32.775 --> 19:34.793
- Yep. See you at home?
- Yep.

19:35.895 --> 19:37.329
Uh-oh. I'm missing two.

19:37.330 --> 19:39.331
Here they are. Two here.

19:39.332 --> 19:42.534
(wheezes) Oh. Regular-Sized Rudy,
I detect a bit of wheeze.

19:42.535 --> 19:45.170
He needs an inhaler
every two hours or he'll die.

19:45.171 --> 19:46.805
Yeah. I-I heard about that.

19:46.806 --> 19:48.206
Oh, uh, here's your vest.

19:48.207 --> 19:49.708
(screams) What did you do to it?!

19:49.709 --> 19:51.209
It was like this when I got it.

19:51.210 --> 19:52.477
Gene! Tina!

19:52.512 --> 19:53.519
How was your day?

19:53.520 --> 19:54.529
- Dorky.
- Booby.

19:54.530 --> 19:56.548
Great, great, glad you had fun.

19:56.582 --> 19:59.384
- (quietly): I think we're in the clear.
- Yeah, we got away with it.

19:59.385 --> 20:01.453
That's not what you should
be taking away from this.

20:01.487 --> 20:03.188
Did we get away with it, Rude?

20:03.189 --> 20:05.724
Perfect crime. Mmm.

20:05.725 --> 20:08.693
I've tasted life,
and I'm hungry for more.

20:08.728 --> 20:10.779
You do realize you
almost made Rudy die.

20:10.813 --> 20:12.697
Almost dying
is the best part of living.

20:12.698 --> 20:14.149
It's called almost-live-dying.

20:14.183 --> 20:16.434
(chuckles) So, when
you run the restaurant,

20:16.435 --> 20:18.737
will you call it Louise's Burgers?

20:18.738 --> 20:22.324
I don't know.
Maybe. Daddy.
