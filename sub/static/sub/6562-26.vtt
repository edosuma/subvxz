08:45.200 --> 08:46.200
LOOK AT YOURSELF.

08:46.200 --> 08:48.067
WHO'S HANDSOMER THAN YOU?

08:48.067 --> 08:49.200
NO ONE.

08:49.200 --> 08:51.067
WHO'S GOT MORE STYLE THAN YOU?

08:51.067 --> 08:52.500
NO ONE.

08:52.500 --> 08:54.433
WHO'S SMARTER THAN YOU?

08:54.433 --> 08:55.833
WELL, LOTS OF PEOPLE,

08:55.833 --> 08:57.900
BUT THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH BEING A MODEL.

08:57.900 --> 08:58.900
HEY, I'M STILL ME.

08:58.900 --> 09:01.233
JUST BETTER.

09:01.233 --> 09:02.433
AND WE COULD ALL WEAR BANDANAS.

09:02.433 --> 09:04.067
IT COULD BE OUR THING.

09:04.067 --> 09:06.567
BANDANAS.

09:06.567 --> 09:07.833
LET'S DO THIS.

09:12.500 --> 09:13.567
[screams]

09:13.567 --> 09:17.900
- [screams]

09:17.900 --> 09:19.967
all: WE'RE NOT WEARING BANDANAS.

09:19.967 --> 09:21.900
- BANDANAS ARE COOL!

09:21.900 --> 09:23.933
- OKAY, GUYS, THAT WAS GREAT.
CUT.

09:23.933 --> 09:25.400
AFTER OUR INTERVIEW,

09:25.400 --> 09:29.133
WE WERE GIVEN EXCLUSIVE ACCESS
TO APARTMENT 2J

09:29.133 --> 09:31.567
WHERE WE MET THE BAND'S
OFFICIAL BABY SISTER

09:31.567 --> 09:33.400
AND UNOFFICIAL MOMAGER.

09:33.400 --> 09:37.433
- SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN KIND OF
NERVOUS IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA.

09:37.433 --> 09:41.067
BUT IF SHE COULD TALK,
SHE'D PROBABLY SAY

09:41.067 --> 09:43.067
EVEN THOUGH
WE'RE NOT ALL RELATED,

09:43.067 --> 09:45.733
WE'RE STILL
ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY.

09:45.733 --> 09:47.067
[both scream]

09:47.067 --> 09:49.700
- BOYS, BOYS, NO FIGHTING.

09:49.700 --> 09:51.400
HOW ABOUT A HEALTHY SNACK
INSTEAD?

09:51.400 --> 09:52.933
[yelps]
[all gasp]

09:52.933 --> 09:53.933
[grunting and smacking]

09:53.933 --> 09:56.133
OKAY, THAT IS ENOUGH!

09:56.133 --> 09:58.733
- I LOVE YOU,
BUT I'M A LITTLE BUSY RIGHT NOW.

09:58.733 --> 09:59.800
OW! OW!

09:59.800 --> 10:01.000
- OW! OW! OW!

10:01.000 --> 10:02.100
- OW! OW! OW! OW! OW!

10:02.100 --> 10:03.167
- OW! OW! OW!

10:03.167 --> 10:04.633
I HAVE SENSITIVE EARS.
YOU KNOW THAT.

10:04.633 --> 10:06.000
- HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:06.000 --> 10:07.900
all: WE'RE STICKING IT
TO THE MAN.

10:07.900 --> 10:09.067
- I WANT TO STICK IT TO THE MAN.

10:09.067 --> 10:11.100
- YOU CAN'T JUST
SELL BIG TIME RUSH GEAR.

10:11.100 --> 10:12.667
- YES, I CAN.
IT'S CALLED BOOT-LEGGING.

10:12.667 --> 10:13.833
- [spits]

10:13.833 --> 10:15.700
HONEY, YOU HAVE GOT TO BE FIRM
WITH THIS GIRL.

10:15.700 --> 10:18.233
JUST TELL HER THAT YOU ARE
NEVER, EVER GOING TO DATE HER

10:18.233 --> 10:20.867
AND SHE SHOULD GO BACK
TO HER BOYFRIEND.

10:20.867 --> 10:23.900
YOU HAVE TO TELL CAMILLE
YOU WANT TO DATE OTHER PEOPLE.

10:23.900 --> 10:25.233
- WHAT IS WITH YOU PARENTS

10:25.233 --> 10:27.533
AND TELLING THE TRUTH
ALL THE TIME?

10:27.533 --> 10:30.633
slam!
[spraying]

10:30.633 --> 10:31.800
- SORRY, BOYS,

10:31.800 --> 10:33.300
BUT THAT CROWN WILL BE MINE.

10:33.300 --> 10:37.500
[spraying, boys yelping]

10:37.500 --> 10:39.133
- MY WORK HERE IS DONE.

10:39.133 --> 10:40.800
- YOU KNOW
THAT PRODUCER LADY'S GONNA HAVE

10:40.800 --> 10:42.633
EVERY SECURITY GUARD ON THE LOT
AFTER YOU.

10:42.633 --> 10:45.333
- NOT IF MY BABY SISTER,
WHOM I LOVE,

10:45.333 --> 10:48.300
CREATES A DISTRACTION.

10:48.300 --> 10:50.900
[helicopter blades whirring,
sirens wail]

10:50.900 --> 10:54.167
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT
TILL I BEAT THE GAME!

10:54.167 --> 10:55.167
[snickers]
thud!

10:55.167 --> 10:56.333
- [screaming]

10:56.333 --> 10:59.567
[helicopter blades whirring,
sirens wail]

10:59.567 --> 11:01.300
- YOU KNOW YOU WERE
REALLY ANNOYING TODAY

11:01.300 --> 11:02.733
WITH ALL THAT
OVERPROTECTIVE STUFF.

11:02.733 --> 11:03.700
- [sighs]

11:03.700 --> 11:06.567
YEAH, I KNOW.

11:06.567 --> 11:08.500
- THANKS.

11:08.500 --> 11:11.167
- MOM!

11:11.167 --> 11:12.467
THANKS.

11:12.467 --> 11:13.567
- smooch!

11:13.567 --> 11:14.900
- COME ON!

11:14.900 --> 11:16.567
- OKAY, WE'RE TAKING A BREAK,

11:16.567 --> 11:19.233
BUT STICK AROUND
AS WE LEAVE THE FAMOUS PALMWOODS

11:19.233 --> 11:21.567
FOR THE LEGENDARY ROCQUE RECORDS

11:21.567 --> 11:23.933
WHERE WE ASK THE BOYS
THE ONE QUESTION

11:23.933 --> 11:25.233
THEY WON'T WANT TO ANSWER.

11:25.233 --> 11:26.633
- WAIT, WHAT?
- WHAT QUESTION?

11:26.633 --> 11:29.700
- ALL THAT AND MORE
WHEN BACKSTAGE ACCESS RETURNS.

11:29.700 --> 11:30.767
- WHAT'S THE QUESTION?

11:30.767 --> 11:32.233
- JUST GIVE US A HINT!

11:32.233 --> 11:33.733
- * I TRY TO SPEAK

11:33.733 --> 11:36.067
* BUT GIRL,
YOU GOT ME TONGUE-TIED *

11:36.067 --> 11:37.467
* I TRY TO BREATHE

11:37.467 --> 11:39.733
* BUT I'M F-F-F-FROZEN INSIDE *

11:39.733 --> 11:40.833
* I TRY TO MOVE

11:40.833 --> 11:42.500
* BUT I'M STUCK IN MY SHOES *

11:42.500 --> 11:44.067
* YOU GOT ME PARALYZED

11:44.067 --> 11:45.367
* PARALYZED

11:45.367 --> 11:46.900
* P-P-P-PARALYZED

11:46.900 --> 11:47.900
* I SEE YOU WALKING

11:47.900 --> 11:50.267
* BUT ALL YOU DO IS PASS ME BY

11:50.267 --> 11:51.667
* CAN'T EVEN TALK *

11:51.667 --> 11:54.067
* 'CAUSE WORDS
DON'T COME INTO MY MIND *

11:54.067 --> 11:55.067
* I'D MAKE A MOVE *

11:55.067 --> 11:56.500
* IF I HAD THE GUTS TO

11:56.500 --> 11:58.133
* BUT I'M PARALYZED *

11:58.133 --> 11:59.433
* PARALYZED

11:59.433 --> 12:00.667
* P-P-P-PARALYZED

12:03.600 --> 12:04.600
- * TALK OF THE TOWN NOW

12:04.600 --> 12:06.400
* AND YOU ALREADY KNOW

12:06.400 --> 12:08.600
* THAT YOU'RE A STAR *

12:08.600 --> 12:09.867
* A SUPERSTAR

12:09.867 --> 12:12.067
* THAT YOU'RE A STAR *

12:12.067 --> 12:13.667
* A SUPERSTAR

12:13.667 --> 12:15.933
* THAT YOU'RE A STAR *

12:15.933 --> 12:19.667
* AND YOU ALREADY KNOW

12:19.667 --> 12:22.067
- HEY, MADISON MICHELE BACK HERE
WITH BIG TIME RUSH.

12:22.067 --> 12:25.733
WHERE THE QUESTION
ON EVERYBODY'S MIND IS...

12:25.733 --> 12:27.800
- COME ON, TELL US.
- BRING IT ON.

12:27.800 --> 12:29.233
- COMING UP LATER.

12:29.233 --> 12:30.500
all: OH!

12:30.500 --> 12:32.500
- WHY DO YOU GUYS
ALWAYS DO THIS KIND OF STUFF?

12:32.500 --> 12:35.067
- BUT THE BURNING QUESTION
ON MY MIND IS,

12:35.067 --> 12:36.500
CARLOS, WHERE'S THE HELMET?

12:36.500 --> 12:37.667
- OH!
[all mutter]

12:37.667 --> 12:39.667
- OKAY, LOOK,
I AGREED NOT TO WEAR IT

12:39.667 --> 12:41.200
DURING PHOTO SHOOTS
AND INTERVIEWS.

12:41.200 --> 12:42.200
- BUT WHY?

12:42.200 --> 12:43.600
I THINK THE HELMET IS CUTE.

12:43.600 --> 12:45.067
- WELL, SO DO I.

12:45.067 --> 12:46.467
- MUCH BETTER.
- I KNEW HE'D BRING IT.

12:46.467 --> 12:50.167
- YOU JUST RUINED YOUR HAIR.
- HEY, MADISON LIKES IT.

12:50.167 --> 12:52.500
- SON OF A MINNEAPOLIS
POLICE OFFICER,

12:52.500 --> 12:55.833
CARLOS GARCIA WAS VOTED
MOST LIKELY TO MARRY A CORNDOG

12:55.833 --> 12:57.333
BY HIS SOPHOMORE CLASS.

12:57.333 --> 12:58.833
NICKNAMED THE WILD RUSH,

12:58.833 --> 13:00.400
HE LEARNED EARLY ON THAT

13:00.400 --> 13:04.233
A LITTLE EXTRA HEAD PROTECTION
CAN GO A LONG WAY.

13:04.233 --> 13:05.600
- WHOO-HOO!

13:05.600 --> 13:09.833
[tapping]

13:09.833 --> 13:12.167
- THE HARDEST PART OF ANY DATE
IS STARTING A CONVERSATION.

13:12.167 --> 13:13.500
SO JUST GO IN THERE

13:13.500 --> 13:16.333
AND TELL HER SOMETHING
INTERESTING ABOUT YOURSELF.

13:16.333 --> 13:19.167
- HERE IS SOMETHING INTERESTING
ABOUT MYSELF.

13:19.167 --> 13:21.833
[tapping]

13:21.833 --> 13:23.133
- NO HELMETS.

13:23.133 --> 13:25.633
HE HATES HELMETS.

13:25.633 --> 13:26.667
[bell dings]

13:26.667 --> 13:29.067
- THEN I STARTED
TAKING MY RASH MEDICINE,

13:29.067 --> 13:33.067
AND IT GOT MOSTLY BETTER.

13:33.067 --> 13:34.367
[bell dings]

13:34.367 --> 13:36.667
SO THEN KENDALL SAYS
HE'S GONNA GET ME A GIRLFRIEND.

13:36.667 --> 13:37.933
AND HERE YOU ARE.

13:37.933 --> 13:39.067
[laughs, chomping]

13:39.067 --> 13:42.067
WHEN DO WE MOUTH KISS?

13:42.067 --> 13:44.067
[bell dings]

13:44.067 --> 13:47.933
[belches loudly]

13:47.933 --> 13:48.933
SWEET.

13:48.933 --> 13:51.133
NOW I CAN DRINK MORE.

13:51.133 --> 13:53.167
[bell dings]

13:53.167 --> 13:54.333
STEP ASIDE, BOYS.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.067
MY UNCLE WAS A LOCKSMITH.

13:56.067 --> 13:58.367
YOU JUST PLACE YOUR HANDS
BETWEEN THE CYLINDER

13:58.367 --> 13:59.667
AND THE CENTRAL HOUSING,

13:59.667 --> 14:02.233
AND THEN HIT IT
WITH A SLEDGEHAMMER!

14:02.233 --> 14:03.900
[screams]

14:03.900 --> 14:05.233
WHAT HAVE I DONE?

14:05.233 --> 14:07.500
ALL MY FRIENDS
ARE ALL TRAPPED IN A WELL.

14:07.500 --> 14:11.067
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO DO.

14:11.067 --> 14:12.500
[screams]

14:12.500 --> 14:13.667
thud!
OOH!

14:13.667 --> 14:16.500
[coughs]

14:16.500 --> 14:17.733
all: WHAT'D YOU DO THAT FOR?

14:17.733 --> 14:19.833
- I WAS LONELY.

14:19.833 --> 14:21.500
THIS LOOKS LIKE A JOB FOR...

14:21.500 --> 14:26.167
EL HOMBRE
EL FLAMING SPACE ROCK MAN.

14:26.167 --> 14:27.167
- [mimics buzzer]

14:27.167 --> 14:29.500
- NOT EVEN A LITTLE.

14:29.500 --> 14:30.500
- HUH!

14:30.500 --> 14:32.067
YOU REALLY ARE A SUPERHERO!

14:32.067 --> 14:33.933
- NO, I'M A POP STAR.

14:36.833 --> 14:39.400
- NOW, SINCE WE'RE HERE
AT ROCQUE RECORDS,

14:39.400 --> 14:40.667
TELL ME, WHAT IS IT LIKE

14:40.667 --> 14:43.567
TO WORK WITH
THE LEGENDARY GUSTAVO ROCQUE?

14:43.567 --> 14:45.067
[all stammer]

14:45.067 --> 14:47.300
- "WORKING WITH GUSTAVO
IS WONDERFUL."

14:47.300 --> 14:49.567
- "HE IS THE BEST
IN THE BUSINESS."

14:49.567 --> 14:50.733
- [reads gibberish]

14:50.733 --> 14:51.900
OH.

14:51.900 --> 14:52.967
"HE'S NICE."

14:52.967 --> 14:57.333
- "WE COULD NOT DO IT
WITHOUT HIM."

14:57.333 --> 14:59.500
- WANTING TO TALK TO
THE MAN BEHIND THE BAND,

14:59.500 --> 15:01.067
WE SAT DOWN WITH GUSTAVO

15:01.067 --> 15:03.300
AND HIS ASSOCIATE,
KELLY WAINRIGHT.

15:03.300 --> 15:05.300
NOW, I'VE SPENT A GOOD PART
OF THE DAY WITH THE BOYS,

15:05.300 --> 15:06.300
AND THEY CAN BE WILD.

15:06.300 --> 15:07.667
HOW DO YOU KEEP THEM IN LINE?

15:07.667 --> 15:10.167
- HOW DO I KEEP THE DOGS
IN LINE, MADISON?

15:10.167 --> 15:12.167
OH, BY THE WAY,
I CALL THEM DOGS.

15:12.167 --> 15:13.767
WITH A LOOK.

15:13.767 --> 15:14.967
YEAH.

15:14.967 --> 15:17.067
THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S ALL IT TAKES.

15:17.067 --> 15:18.100
A LOOK.

15:24.500 --> 15:27.667
- ACTUALLY,
IT TAKES MORE THAN A LOOK.

15:27.667 --> 15:29.633
IT TAKES THE FACE.

15:29.633 --> 15:32.667
- THE FACE
DOES NOT BEAT THE LOOK.

15:32.667 --> 15:34.267
- YES, IT DOES.

15:52.467 --> 15:54.833
- WITH 27 GOLD RECORDS
TO HIS CREDIT,

15:54.833 --> 15:56.833
GUSTAVO ROCQUE
MADE A NAME IN THE '90s

15:56.833 --> 15:59.067
AS THE VOLCANIC PRODUCER
OF HIT BANDS

15:59.067 --> 16:01.233
LIKE BOYZ IN THE ATTIC
AND BOYZ CITY.

16:01.233 --> 16:03.733
BUT NOW THAT HIS NEW BAND
IS CLIMBING THE CHARTS,

16:03.733 --> 16:05.500
HE CLAIMS HE'S CALMING DOWN.

16:05.500 --> 16:07.367
- [growling, roars]

16:07.367 --> 16:12.067
[screaming]

16:12.067 --> 16:15.067
ALL TALENT ARE DOGS.

16:15.067 --> 16:18.167
AND DOGS NEED TO KNOW
WHO'S IN CHARGE

16:18.167 --> 16:21.067
OR THEY WILL NOT LISTEN
TO COMMANDS

16:21.067 --> 16:23.667
AND POOP ON YOUR CARPET.

16:23.667 --> 16:25.167
DOGS.
DOGS.

16:25.167 --> 16:26.633
DOGS!
DOGS.

16:26.633 --> 16:28.267
I NEED TO STAY WITH YOU DOGS
TONIGHT.

16:28.267 --> 16:29.833
DOGS.
HEY, DOGS.

16:29.833 --> 16:30.833
I HATE THOSE DOGS.

16:30.833 --> 16:32.267
DOGS.
DOGS.

16:32.267 --> 16:34.333
DOGS!

16:34.333 --> 16:37.700
WHAT ELSE DO YOU DOGS DO
ON FISH STICK FRIDAYS?

16:37.700 --> 16:40.467
YOU WANT ME TO LET THE MONKEYS
MATCH THE SET?

16:40.467 --> 16:42.500
- I THOUGHT WE WERE DOGS.

16:42.500 --> 16:43.667
- YOU'RE MONKEY DOGS!

16:43.667 --> 16:46.067
* THAT YOU'RE A STAR *

16:46.067 --> 16:47.533
* A SUPERSTAR

16:47.533 --> 16:49.233
* THAT YOU'RE A STAR *

16:49.233 --> 16:53.067
* AND YOU ALREADY KNOW

16:53.067 --> 16:55.167
SO HOW WAS THAT?

16:55.167 --> 16:58.700
- AND NOW, THE QUESTION
YOU'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR.

16:58.700 --> 17:00.167
- DO YOUR WORST.

17:00.167 --> 17:01.300
- BUT FIRST...

17:01.300 --> 17:02.300
- OH, WHAT?
- AGAIN?

17:02.300 --> 17:03.400
- YOU KEEP DOING THIS.

17:03.400 --> 17:04.667
- A POP QUIZ FOR THE GROUP.

17:04.667 --> 17:05.867
- A POP QUIZ.

17:05.867 --> 17:08.067
- WHO IS THE ONLY POP STAR
ON THE CHARTS

17:08.067 --> 17:10.667
WHO'S ALSO A MEMBER OF
THE FUTURE DOCTORS OF AMERICA?

17:10.667 --> 17:12.167
- [stammers]
I GOT THIS ONE.

17:12.167 --> 17:13.333
I KNOW THIS.
UM...

17:13.333 --> 17:15.067
- IT'S ME.
- NO, JUST--LOGAN, STOP.
