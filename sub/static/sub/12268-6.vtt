WEBVTT

00:01.772 --> 00:03.274
PREVIOUSLY ON "REVENGE"...
 (gunshot)

00:03.274 --> 00:05.606
THE WHITE-HAIRED MAN IS DEAD.
HIS NAME WAS GORDON MURPHY.

00:05.606 --> 00:07.178
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE YOU NEED
TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR MOTHER.

00:07.178 --> 00:09.009
GORDON MURPHY
WAS HER HUSBAND.

00:09.009 --> 00:11.142
KARA CLARKE IS STILL ALIVE.

00:11.142 --> 00:12.443
(Conrad)
SO WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS?

00:12.443 --> 00:13.644
(Victoria) I SHOULD HOPE
THAT YOU'D STAY WITH US.

00:13.644 --> 00:15.786
(Nolan) SHE'S STAYING
AT THE GRAYSONS'?

00:15.786 --> 00:17.218
AMANDA'S AWAKE AND OKAY.

00:17.218 --> 00:18.389
I'M GOING TO THE HOSPITAL.

00:18.389 --> 00:20.721
I'M KARA,
AMANDA'S ACTUAL MOTHER.

00:20.721 --> 00:21.722
PLEASE. ALLOW ME.

00:21.722 --> 00:23.394
(Amanda grunts)
 PLEASE.

00:23.394 --> 00:25.056
I THINK YOU'VE DONE
QUITE ENOUGH, MASON.

00:25.056 --> 00:26.597
SOMEONE FROM YOUR COMPANY

00:26.597 --> 00:28.529
ASKED DANIEL
ABOUT MY FATHER'S INVESTMENT.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.531
Nolan, it was Padma.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.164
WILL YOU DO ME THE HONOR
OF BECOMING MY WIFE?

00:33.164 --> 00:35.035
LEGALLY BOUND SO THAT WE MAY
NEVER BE COMPELLED

00:35.035 --> 00:37.308
TO TESTIFY AGAINST EACH OTHER.

00:37.308 --> 00:40.211
YOU HAD A TERRIBLE SCAR.
ONE THAT IS NOW MISSING.

00:40.211 --> 00:41.172
WHY DO YOU CARE?

00:41.172 --> 00:43.144
THE DAUGHTER OF KARA WALLACE
AND DAVID CLARKE

00:43.144 --> 00:45.116
YOU MOST DEFINITELY ARE NOT.

00:48.819 --> 00:51.182
(Emily) IF WE CHOOSE TO,

00:51.182 --> 00:55.126
WE CAN LIVE IN A WORLD
OF COMFORTING ILLUSION.

00:59.190 --> 01:04.265
WE CAN ALLOW OURSELVES TO BE
DECEIVED BY FALSE REALITIES...

01:11.172 --> 01:14.845
OR WE CAN USE THEM
TO HIDE OUR TRUE INTENTIONS.

01:14.845 --> 01:16.347
(speaks inaudibly)

01:16.347 --> 01:17.648
(knock on door)

01:17.648 --> 01:20.181
HI.
 AH, MR. MATHIS.

01:20.181 --> 01:22.113
SO HOW IS THE VETTING
OF MY COMPANY GOING?

01:22.113 --> 01:24.185
DANIEL PROVIDE YOU
WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED?

01:24.185 --> 01:25.686
I'D SAY WE'RE ABOUT
HALFWAY THERE.

01:25.686 --> 01:27.688
IF THINGS CONTINUE ON TRACK,

01:27.688 --> 01:29.520
I'LL BE SENDING
MY RECOMMENDATION TO MR. TAKEDA

01:29.520 --> 01:30.691
BY THE END OF NEXT WEEK.

01:30.691 --> 01:32.163
GOOD.

01:32.163 --> 01:34.665
ARE CONDOLENCES
OR CONGRATULATIONS IN ORDER?

01:34.665 --> 01:36.197
BOTH.

01:36.197 --> 01:38.669
MY MOTHER AND FATHER
ARE REMARRYING THIS WEEKEND.

01:38.669 --> 01:41.132
AND IF YOU AREN'T BUSY,
WE'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU JOIN US.

01:41.132 --> 01:43.103
NOTHING FUSSY
THIS TIME AROUND.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.436
JUST A HUNDRED OR SO AT
THE SOUTH LAWN OF THE HUNT CLUB.

01:45.436 --> 01:48.239
I'D BE HONORED.
UH, MAY I BRING A DATE?

01:48.239 --> 01:50.541
(Conrad) BY ALL MEANS.

01:50.541 --> 01:51.882
ALL SET?

01:51.882 --> 01:53.714
NICE WORK. THANKS, GINO.

01:53.714 --> 01:55.846
PARDON ME.

01:55.846 --> 01:58.849
(telephone ringing in distance)

01:58.849 --> 02:01.121
(horn honks in distance)

02:01.121 --> 02:04.124
(clears throat) SO...

02:04.124 --> 02:06.757
THE EMPEROR'S GETTING
NEW CLOTHES.

02:06.757 --> 02:09.500
AND JUST LIKE THE STORY,
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME

02:09.500 --> 02:14.205
BEFORE THE WORLD LEARNS
HE'S UNFIT TO LEAD.

02:14.205 --> 02:15.666
OKAY, HERE'S THE LIST
OF THE RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGEONS

02:15.666 --> 02:17.208
THAT YOU CONSULTED WITH.

02:17.208 --> 02:20.441
ULTIMATELY, DR. SPENCER IS
THE ONE WHO REMOVED THE SCARS.

02:20.441 --> 02:23.143
YOU RECOVERED
AT THE PLAZA HOTEL ON...

02:23.143 --> 02:25.416
SEPTEMBER 19th, 2007.

02:25.416 --> 02:27.618
(sighs) 2006.

02:27.618 --> 02:29.820
AMANDA, YOU NEED TO KNOW
THESE DETAILS.
 (sighs)

02:29.820 --> 02:32.283
MASON'S GONNA TRY TO CONFUSE YOU
WITH THESE QUESTIONS.

02:32.283 --> 02:35.226
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO TELL HIM
I PAID FOR ALL THIS?

02:35.226 --> 02:38.259
A GENEROUS PATRON
FROM THE CLUB.

02:38.259 --> 02:40.231
I'VE WRITTEN DOWN SPECIFICS
ABOUT HIM, TOO.

02:40.231 --> 02:41.762
THOUGH HOPEFULLY,
YOU WON'T HAVE TO GO THERE.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.464
WHAT IF HE DOESN'T BUY IT?

02:43.464 --> 02:45.196
WHAT IF HE STARTS
DIGGING DEEPER?

02:45.196 --> 02:46.337
HE WON'T.

02:46.337 --> 02:47.668
BY THE END OF THIS WEEKEND,

02:47.668 --> 02:49.500
MY BURN SCARS WILL BE
YESTERDAY'S NEWS,

02:49.500 --> 02:52.243
AND... MASON'S ATTENTION
WILL BE FOCUSED

02:52.243 --> 02:54.775
ON THE NEXT TRAIL
I'M SENDING HIM DOWN.

02:54.775 --> 02:57.308
AND WHERE
WILL THAT ONE LEAD?

02:57.308 --> 02:59.850
BACK TO THE GRAYSONS.

03:17.228 --> 03:19.670
YOU'RE A VERY LUCKY WOMAN.

03:19.670 --> 03:22.433
KARA. I SEE THAT
YOU'VE MADE YOURSELF AT HOME.

03:22.433 --> 03:24.775
(singsongy) I'M TRYING.

03:24.775 --> 03:26.837
(normal voice)
IT'S EASY TO GET LOST HERE.

03:26.837 --> 03:29.209
(chuckles)

03:30.641 --> 03:33.314
A SECOND CHANCE AT LOVE...

03:33.314 --> 03:36.247
DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY OFTEN.

03:36.247 --> 03:38.849
BUT A THIRD
AND A FOURTH...

03:38.849 --> 03:41.622
YOU MUST CAST
QUITE A SPELL.

03:41.622 --> 03:43.454
I HOPE YOU'RE COMING
TO THE WEDDING.

03:43.454 --> 03:46.397
I'M GONNA SPEND THE WEEKEND
WITH MY DAUGHTER

03:46.397 --> 03:48.899
AND MY GRANDSON.

03:48.899 --> 03:51.462
HOW ARE THEY FARING?

03:51.462 --> 03:52.803
WELL.
 GOOD.

03:52.803 --> 03:55.366
CONSIDERING EVERYTHING
THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH.

03:55.366 --> 03:58.238
OF COURSE, WHEN I IMAGINE
WHAT YOU'VE ENDURED...

03:58.238 --> 04:01.272
EVERY DAY MUST BE
A BLESSING TO YOU, TOO.

04:01.272 --> 04:03.274
SENT STRAIGHT FROM HEAVEN.
(chuckles)

04:03.274 --> 04:06.277
(sniffs)

04:06.277 --> 04:08.779
I READ IN THE PAPER
THAT, UM,

04:08.779 --> 04:10.951
WHILE YOU WERE BEING HELD,

04:10.951 --> 04:14.485
AGENT MURPHY
CAME TO SEE YOU EVERY DAY.

04:14.485 --> 04:16.786
WHAT DID YOU TWO TALK ABOUT?

04:16.786 --> 04:19.959
HE DIDN'T SO MUCH TALK
AS HE TORTURED.

04:19.959 --> 04:22.333
HOWEVER KINDLY
HE MAY HAVE TREATED YOU,

04:22.333 --> 04:25.896
THE MAN WHO ABDUCTED ME HAD
NOTHING BUT EVIL IN HIS HEART.

04:33.304 --> 04:36.877
YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL.

04:39.810 --> 04:42.913
I LOVE YOU.

04:42.913 --> 04:44.415
EVIL, HUH?

04:44.415 --> 04:47.388
BUT NOW HE HAS PROVEN HIMSELF
TO BE EXACTLY WHAT HE IS,

04:47.388 --> 04:49.690
WHICH IS
A GARDEN-VARIETY COWARD.

04:51.362 --> 04:53.864
THEN I GUESS IT'S SAFE
FOR ME TO GO.

04:57.328 --> 05:00.631
HE MAY BE A COWARD,
BUT HE'S CERTAINLY DANGEROUS.

05:00.631 --> 05:02.773
AND I WOULD FEEL BETTER
IF YOU REMAINED HERE

05:02.773 --> 05:04.304
SAFELY WITH US

05:04.304 --> 05:06.507
UNTIL WE KNOW WE NEVER
HAVE TO FACE HIM AGAIN.

05:07.978 --> 05:09.810
(cell phone rings)

05:09.810 --> 05:10.981
(ring)

05:10.981 --> 05:12.312
HELLO, EMILY.
 (elevator bell dings)

05:12.312 --> 05:15.015
AND HERE I WAS THINKING
WE WEREN'T TALKING.

05:15.015 --> 05:17.648
I NEED THE GUN YOU USED
TO KILL GORDON MURPHY.

05:17.648 --> 05:19.550
YES, AND I HAVE A REQUEST
OF YOU.

05:19.550 --> 05:21.822
ACCOMPANY ME
TO THE GRAYSON WEDDING.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.954
(sighs)
DO YOU HAVE THE GUN OR NOT?

05:23.954 --> 05:26.326
SAY YES, AND IT'S YOURS.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.658
(grunts) YES.

05:27.658 --> 05:29.360
I'M GONNA TEXT YOU
THE ADDRESS WHERE I AM.

05:29.360 --> 05:31.101
Meet me here
and wear gloves.

05:31.101 --> 05:34.465
WHY? WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

05:34.465 --> 05:38.509
TAKING A LONG-TERM PLAN
OFF ICE.

05:38.509 --> 05:40.040
(unzips bag)

05:42.673 --> 05:52.823
(closes zipper)

05:57.087 --> 05:58.489
YOU SEE, THIS I LOVE,

05:58.489 --> 06:00.090
BUT IN THE WRONG LIGHT,

06:00.090 --> 06:01.692
GOD FORBID YOUR MOTHER THINKS
I'VE WORN WHITE TO HER WEDDING.

06:01.692 --> 06:03.033
UNZIP ME?

06:03.033 --> 06:04.965
LEGAL'S TELLING ME
THEY NO LONGER HAVE ACCESS

06:04.965 --> 06:07.067
TO DAVID CLARKE'S SIGNED
EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.899
EVERY ORIGINAL DOCUMENT
RELATING TO HIM

06:08.899 --> 06:10.971
WAS SEIZED BY THE GOVERNMENT
19 YEARS AGO.

06:10.971 --> 06:13.003
THEN IT STANDS TO REASON
THAT NOLCORP'S C.F.O.

06:13.003 --> 06:14.875
CAN'T GET HER HANDS
ON IT EITHER,

06:14.875 --> 06:17.708
IF SHE'S EVEN AWARE
OF THE IMPLICATIONS.

06:17.708 --> 06:19.410
PERHAPS AIDEN'S THEORY
THAT NOLCORP

06:19.410 --> 06:21.412
IS AN UNDISCLOSED
GRAYSON SUBSIDIARY

06:21.412 --> 06:23.383
IS AS CRAZY AS IT SOUNDS.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.155
OR MAYBE NOLAN FOUND OUT
SHE CAME TO US

06:25.155 --> 06:26.957
AND SHUT DOWN
HER INVESTIGATION.

06:26.957 --> 06:28.088
THEN INVITE HIM
TO THE WEDDING.

06:28.088 --> 06:29.990
SUSS HIM OUT
ON NEUTRAL GROUND.

06:29.990 --> 06:32.463
MY PARENTS' WEDDING
IS HARDLY NEUTRAL GROUND.

06:34.425 --> 06:36.126
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
HE'D ACCEPT THE INVITATION?

06:36.126 --> 06:38.168
BECAUSE NOLAN ROSS
IS MEDICALLY INCAPABLE

06:38.168 --> 06:41.101
OF STAYING AWAY
FROM A GOOD PARTY.

06:43.133 --> 06:46.176
(presses keys)

06:46.176 --> 06:48.108
(bell clangs in distance)

06:50.481 --> 06:51.882
(Jack) AMANDA?

06:51.882 --> 06:53.143
HEY.

06:53.143 --> 06:54.845
WHERE YOU HEADED?

06:54.845 --> 06:56.617
OH, HEY.

06:56.617 --> 06:58.919
I WAS JUST GONNA GO OUT
TO GET SOME MORE DIAPERS.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.551
I GRABBED SOME
THIS MORNING.

07:00.551 --> 07:01.892
BOTTOM DRAWER.

07:01.892 --> 07:04.555
GREAT.

07:04.555 --> 07:07.427
I THINK I'LL, UH,
STILL TAKE HIM FOR A WALK.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.159
THE DOCTOR SAYS I SHOULD BE
OUT AND ABOUT

07:09.159 --> 07:10.801
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

07:10.801 --> 07:13.433
WELL, YOU'VE CERTAINLY
BEEN DOING A LOT OF THAT.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.806
HOW ARE THINGS DOWNSTAIRS?

07:15.806 --> 07:17.968
(sighs) TO BE HONEST,
I DON'T THINK I REALIZED

07:17.968 --> 07:20.110
HOW MUCH THIS PLACE BEING CLOSED
PUT ME IN A FUNK,

07:20.110 --> 07:22.513
BUT I SWEAR, IT'S LIKE I'M
STARTING TO FEEL ALIVE AGAIN.

07:22.513 --> 07:23.474
CAREFUL.

07:23.474 --> 07:24.815
YOU ONCE TOLD ME
HOW MUCH YOU HATED

07:24.815 --> 07:26.176
THAT YOUR FATHER
MEASURED HIS HAPPINESS

07:26.176 --> 07:28.479
BY THE NIGHT'S RECEIPTS.

07:28.479 --> 07:30.821
YEAH, BUT THAT'S BECAUSE
IT'S ALL HE HAD.

07:30.821 --> 07:32.553
DECLAN AND I WERE ALWAYS
BUTTING HEADS WITH HIM,

07:32.553 --> 07:34.024
HIS MARRIAGE WAS CRAP.

07:34.024 --> 07:36.887
BUT I'M GONNA PROVE THAT...

07:36.887 --> 07:39.129
YOU CAN HAVE IT ALL.

07:40.961 --> 07:43.133
JUST YOU WAIT.

07:43.133 --> 07:45.766
(Declan) JACK!

07:45.766 --> 07:47.237
JACK! COME ON!

07:47.237 --> 07:49.199
I GOTTA GET DOWN THERE.

07:50.641 --> 07:51.772
(men speak indistinctly)

07:51.772 --> 07:53.473
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

07:53.473 --> 07:54.945
I TOLD THEM TO WAIT FOR YOU,
BUT THEY JUST STARTED INTO IT.

07:54.945 --> 07:57.047
GUYS, GUYS, WHAT'S GOING ON?

07:57.047 --> 07:59.550
THERE HE IS.
WHO THE HELL IS THIS GUY?

07:59.550 --> 08:01.512
TELL HIM HOW LONG
I'VE BEEN STOCKING YOUR LIQUOR.

08:01.512 --> 08:04.054
I'M SORRY, JACK, YOUR MAN HERE--
HIS PRICES ARE HIGH.

08:04.054 --> 08:05.756
WE CAN DO BETTER.

08:05.756 --> 08:07.257
YOU CAN'T DO TOP-SHELF BRANDS
FOR 8 BUCKS A BOTTLE.

08:07.257 --> 08:08.258
NO, YOU CAN'T. I CAN.

08:08.258 --> 08:11.061
WHOA. SLOW DOWN.
CAN WE REALLY GET 8 BUCKS?

08:11.061 --> 08:12.563
NO ONE COULD DO $8, JACK.

08:12.563 --> 08:13.694
NOT LEGALLY.

08:13.694 --> 08:14.965
OH.

08:14.965 --> 08:16.496
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
PAL, HUH?

08:16.496 --> 08:17.968
KENNY, KENNY, KENNY,
I GOT IT.
 HUH?

08:17.968 --> 08:19.199
(Jack) I GOT IT.

08:22.573 --> 08:25.105
LOOK, MICK, LET ME
JUST MAKE SOME PHONE CALLS.

08:25.105 --> 08:26.677
IF IT TURNS OUT
YOU'RE COMPETITIVE,

08:26.677 --> 08:27.978
YOU KNOW YOU'RE MY GUY.

08:27.978 --> 08:30.781
DON'T BOTHER. I GOT ONE THING
TO SAY TO YOU BOYS.

08:30.781 --> 08:32.712
YOUR FATHER WOULD BE
ASHAMED OF YOU.

08:32.712 --> 08:35.085
I HOPE YOU KNOW WHO YOU'RE
GETTING IN BUSINESS WITH.

08:40.991 --> 08:43.654
(door opens)

09:08.619 --> 09:10.851
THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

09:10.851 --> 09:12.082
SORRY.

09:12.082 --> 09:13.553
OH, NO, I, UM...

09:13.553 --> 09:16.887
I GET SO FOCUSED
SOMETIMES WHEN I DRAW, I--

09:16.887 --> 09:19.289
FORGET WHERE YOU ARE.

09:20.631 --> 09:21.862
YOU--DO YOU DRAW?

09:23.293 --> 09:24.765
YEAH.

09:26.597 --> 09:29.299
THINGS GETTING
A LITTLE HECTIC UP THERE

09:29.299 --> 09:31.341
WITH THE WEDDING COMING UP?

09:31.341 --> 09:33.243
MM.

09:33.243 --> 09:35.646
THAT WAS ALMOST YOU
LAST YEAR.

09:35.646 --> 09:36.877
RIGHT?

09:36.877 --> 09:38.308
YOU AND DANIEL.

09:38.308 --> 09:40.611
YEAH.

09:40.611 --> 09:42.312
I'M SORRY.

09:42.312 --> 09:43.954
IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT...

09:43.954 --> 09:45.786
NO, NO, IT'S FINE.

09:45.786 --> 09:50.020
I'M ACTUALLY KIND OF GLAD
THAT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

09:51.261 --> 09:52.763
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY.

09:52.763 --> 09:56.196
YOU DON'T JUST MARRY THE MAN.
YOU MARRY THE WHOLE FAMILY.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.931
FOR REASONS THAT I'LL NEVER
FULLY KNOW,

10:00.931 --> 10:02.633
VICTORIA DECIDED EARLY ON

10:02.633 --> 10:04.675
SHE DIDN'T WANT MY RELATIONSHIP
WITH DANIEL TO WORK,

10:04.675 --> 10:07.337
AND SO... IT DIDN'T.

10:07.337 --> 10:10.040
PLEASE DON'T TELL THEM
THAT I'M TELLING YOU THIS.

10:10.040 --> 10:11.882
I DON'T NEED ANY MORE
BAD BLOOD WITH THE GRAYSONS.

10:11.882 --> 10:13.283
DON'T WORRY.

10:13.283 --> 10:15.045
I'M VERY GOOD WITH SECRETS.

10:15.045 --> 10:17.788
AND AS FAR
AS THE GRAYSONS GO,

10:17.788 --> 10:20.290
THEY'LL GET
WHAT'S COMING TO THEM.

10:20.290 --> 10:22.322
PEOPLE LIKE THAT
ALWAYS DO.

10:28.659 --> 10:30.330
THIS WAS RATHER
AN EXPENSIVE PROCEDURE

10:30.330 --> 10:33.003
FOR A GIRL ONLY 18 MONTHS
OUT OF JUVIE.

10:33.003 --> 10:35.335
(cooing)
 WHAT CAN I SAY?

10:35.335 --> 10:38.669
I DIDN'T LIKE WHAT THAT SCAR
REMINDED ME OF.

10:38.669 --> 10:41.411
IT WAS WORTH IT
TO MAKE IT GO AWAY.

10:43.043 --> 10:45.145
NOW WILL YOU?

10:45.145 --> 10:46.677
GO AWAY?

10:46.677 --> 10:48.749
TELL ME SOMETHING, AMANDA.

10:48.749 --> 10:52.052
WHY LIVE IN THE SHADOW OF
THE PEOPLE WHO RUINED YOUR LIFE?

10:52.052 --> 10:53.784
WHY NOT PUT A MILLION MILES

10:53.784 --> 10:55.425
BETWEEN YOURSELF
AND THE GRAYSONS?

10:55.425 --> 10:57.427
IS IT EGO,

10:57.427 --> 10:59.659
A DEFIANT SHOW OF STRENGTH?

10:59.659 --> 11:01.692
I GUESS I WANTED
TO FACE THEM.

11:01.692 --> 11:03.433
BUT THEN JACK HAPPENED,

11:03.433 --> 11:05.165
AND NOW CARL.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.436
SO THAT'S IT THEN?

11:06.436 --> 11:08.368
THE PAST IS PAST
FOR AMANDA CLARKE?

11:08.368 --> 11:09.870
I'M NOT GONNA JEOPARDIZE
MY FAMILY

11:09.870 --> 11:11.201
FOR SIMPLE PAYBACK.

11:11.201 --> 11:12.873
OTHERS WILL EVENTUALLY
PICK UP THE TORCH

11:12.873 --> 11:15.375
TO EXPOSE THE GRAYSONS
FOR THE FRAUDS THEY ARE.

11:15.375 --> 11:18.408
ALTHOUGH VICTORIA'S
LITTLE KIDNAPPING STORY

11:18.408 --> 11:21.111
SEEMED TO GO DOWN PRETTY EASY
FOR EVERYONE.

11:21.111 --> 11:22.452
AH, NO, DEAR.

11:22.452 --> 11:24.755
I PRACTICALLY REQUIRED
THE HEIMLICH WHEN I HEARD.

11:24.755 --> 11:27.918
THAT GUY THEY ACCUSED
OF DOING IT--

11:27.918 --> 11:29.920
CONRAD USED TO WORK
WITH HIM.

11:29.920 --> 11:32.763
I THINK
THEY FRAMED HIM SOMEHOW,

11:32.763 --> 11:34.765
JUST LIKE MY FATHER.

11:34.765 --> 11:36.396
HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS?

11:36.396 --> 11:37.928
I SAW HIM AT THE HOUSE
LAST SUMMER,

11:37.928 --> 11:39.730
ARGUING WITH CONRAD.

11:39.730 --> 11:41.031
WHEN HE LEFT, I SNUCK A PEEK
AT HIS PHONE

11:41.031 --> 11:42.432
TO SEE HIS RECENT CALLS.

11:42.432 --> 11:44.204
ONLY ONE OF THEM
WAS UNASSIGNED.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.276
I THINK IT BELONGED
TO THE WHITE-HAIRED MAN.

11:46.276 --> 11:48.278
WHOEVER FINDS HIM

11:48.278 --> 11:52.712
WILL BLOW THE LID
ON THE WHOLE STORY.

11:52.712 --> 11:55.385
YOU NEVER DID ANYTHING
WITH THE NUMBER?

11:55.385 --> 11:57.387
THAT WOULD'VE REQUIRED
GOING TO THE POLICE.

11:57.387 --> 11:59.850
I MEAN... (huffs) IT'S NOT
LIKE I HAD THE RESOURCES

11:59.850 --> 12:03.824
TO HACK PHONE RECORDS
BY MYSELF.

12:03.824 --> 12:07.297
I, ON THE OTHER HAND,
CAN BE QUITE RESOURCEFUL.

12:07.297 --> 12:11.932
I WOULD LIKE NOTHING MORE
THAN TO PICK UP YOUR TORCH...

12:11.932 --> 12:15.405
AND USE IT TO SET
THE GRAYSONS ABLAZE.

12:18.839 --> 12:20.771
MM.

12:20.771 --> 12:24.744

TO THIS CUFFLINK?

12:24.744 --> 12:25.916

12:25.916 --> 12:28.378

AT OUR FIRST WEDDING.

12:28.378 --> 12:29.880

TO WEAR THEM TODAY.

12:29.880 --> 12:32.322
OH. WELL, THEN LET'S CALL
THE WHOLE THING OFF.

12:33.924 --> 12:36.156

CONRAD,

12:36.156 --> 12:37.958
SINCE WE'RE PERPETRATING ONE.

12:37.958 --> 12:41.031
YEAH, I THINK I'LL GO
WITH THE PEARLS.

12:41.031 --> 12:43.333
CHARLOTTE, WHY ISN'T
YOUR HAIR DONE?

12:43.333 --> 12:44.764
HERE.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.967
THIS IS FOR YOU
FOR TODAY.

12:49.900 --> 12:51.241
YOU GAVE IT TO ME
FOR MY--

12:51.241 --> 12:54.174
16th BIRTHDAY.
WE HAD TEA AT THE PIERRE

12:54.174 --> 12:55.545
AND SAW "SWAN LAKE."

12:55.545 --> 12:58.949
I THOUGHT IT COULD REPRESENT
SOMETHING BORROWED AND BLUE.

12:58.949 --> 13:01.011
THANK YOU.

13:01.011 --> 13:02.282
(kisses)

13:02.282 --> 13:03.513
NOW YOU REALLY HAVE TO
GET YOUR HAIR DONE.

13:03.513 --> 13:04.554
THE CARS ARE COMING
IN TWO HOURS.

13:04.554 --> 13:06.786
I'M NOT GOING, MOM.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.458
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU'RE NOT
GOING? OF COURSE YOU ARE.

13:08.458 --> 13:10.991
I CAN'T DO IT--GO OUT THERE
IN FRONT OF ALL THOSE PEOPLE

13:10.991 --> 13:14.264
AND FAKE IT FOR YET ANOTHER
P.R. STUNT?

13:14.264 --> 13:15.926
(Conrad)
NOBODY'S FAKING ANYTHING.

13:15.926 --> 13:17.297
YOUR MOTHER AND I
WOULDN'T BE DOING THIS

13:17.297 --> 13:18.869
IF WE DIDN'T BOTH WANT IT.

13:18.869 --> 13:20.500
THE QUESTION ISN'T
WHETHER YOU WANT IT,

13:20.500 --> 13:21.972
IT'S WHY.

13:21.972 --> 13:24.004
I'M GOING TO GO HELP DECLAN
AT THE STOWAWAY.

13:24.004 --> 13:25.275
THEY'RE REOPENING TODAY.

13:25.275 --> 13:26.806
OH, NOT THAT ONE AGAIN.

13:26.806 --> 13:27.577
"THAT ONE," MOM,

13:27.577 --> 13:29.509
IS THE ONLY THING
THAT'S REAL IN MY LIFE.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.811
CAN YOU TWO SAY THE SAME
ABOUT EACH OTHER?

13:35.815 --> 13:37.147
(Amanda)
Treadwell went for it.

13:37.147 --> 13:38.318
HE TOOK THE NUMBER?

13:38.318 --> 13:40.320
He practically
ran off with it.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.522
AND HE SEEMS TO THINK
I'M YOU AGAIN...

13:42.522 --> 13:44.194
FOR NOW.

13:44.194 --> 13:46.196
THANK YOU, AND TRUST ME,
THIS IS ALL GONNA WORK OUT.

13:46.196 --> 13:47.397

13:47.397 --> 13:48.528

WEARING IT

14:00.340 --> 14:01.571

14:01.571 --> 14:02.913

I WAS EVEN INVITED?

CLOSED-CAPTIONED SHOW AGAIN?

14:07.617 --> 14:10.050

HE'S ON A DIGGING MISSION

14:10.050 --> 14:12.052
ABOUT MY FATHER INVESTING
IN NOLCORP.

14:12.052 --> 14:15.855

A CABOOSE FOR THE CONGA LINE.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.087

14:17.087 --> 14:18.628

14:18.628 --> 14:22.492
EMILY WANTED TO KNOW IF YOU
NEEDED TO BORROW A DRESS

14:22.492 --> 14:24.995
FOR THE WEDDING,
GIVEN THE SHORT NOTICE.

14:24.995 --> 14:26.566

14:26.566 --> 14:28.638
I'VE... GOT IT COVERED.
 MM-HMM.

14:28.638 --> 14:30.440
THANKS.

14:32.943 --> 14:34.304
YOU INVITED HER?

14:34.304 --> 14:36.506
SHE'S EXCHANGING INFORMATION
WITH DANIEL, NOLAN.

14:36.506 --> 14:38.308
YEAH, I WANT TO CONFIRM THAT
FOR MYSELF

14:38.308 --> 14:40.310
BEFORE I DO SOMETHING
THAT I'LL REGRET.

14:40.310 --> 14:42.182
NOT THAT I EXPECT YOU
TO UNDERSTAND.

14:42.182 --> 14:43.653
NO, WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND

14:43.653 --> 14:45.415
IS WHY YOU'RE WILLING TO RISK
YOUR ENTIRE COMPANY FOR THIS.

14:45.415 --> 14:48.118
IF SHE HELPS PROVE THAT
MY FATHER INVESTED IN NOLCORP,

14:48.118 --> 14:49.419

WITH EVERYTHING THEY HAVE.

14:49.419 --> 14:50.590

14:50.590 --> 14:52.963

29:40.209 --> 29:42.781
A COUPLE OF MINUTES AGO.
WHY? WHAT'S GOING ON?
 THAT'S--THAT'S HER FATHER.

29:42.781 --> 29:45.855
THE VICTIM IS THE SAME MAN
AUTHORITIES WERE SEARCHING FOR

29:45.855 --> 29:48.357
IN VICTORIA GRAYSON'S
KIDNAPPING CASE.

29:48.357 --> 29:50.319
OF COURSE, WE'LL HAVE
MUCH MORE ON THIS STORY

29:50.319 --> 29:52.922
AS IT DEVELOPS.
AGAIN, LIVE NEWS--

29:52.922 --> 29:55.164
CONRAD GRAYSON
OF GRAYSON GLOBAL

29:55.164 --> 29:57.266
HAS BEEN TAKEN INTO CUSTODY.

29:57.266 --> 29:59.328
MOM.
 (police radio chatter)

29:59.328 --> 30:00.830
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

30:00.830 --> 30:02.471
CHARLOTTE, SWEETHEART,
I ASSURE YOU,

30:02.471 --> 30:04.233
YOUR FATHER HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS.

30:04.233 --> 30:05.404
(Mason) NOTHING?

30:05.404 --> 30:06.575
OH, DEAR.

30:06.575 --> 30:08.807
WELL, WHATEVER HELPS YOU
SLEEP AT NIGHT.

30:08.807 --> 30:09.979
GET OUT OF MY HOUSE,
MASON.

30:09.979 --> 30:11.180
AND SPEAKING OF SLEEP,

30:11.180 --> 30:13.242
WERE YOU AND CONNY
TOSSING AND TURNING,

30:13.242 --> 30:16.015
KNOWING YOUR ACCOMPLICE
IN THAT KIDNAPPING FIASCO

30:16.015 --> 30:17.316
WAS STILL OUT THERE,

30:17.316 --> 30:20.389
OR HAS HE BEEN DEAD
THIS WHOLE TIME?

30:20.389 --> 30:23.522
CHARLOTTE, GO UPSTAIRS.
I'LL JOIN YOU IN A MINUTE.

30:23.522 --> 30:25.855
SEE, I'D SAY THAT
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE CONRAD

30:25.855 --> 30:27.296
TO GET HIS HANDS DIRTY,

30:27.296 --> 30:29.528
BUT I GUESS WHEN YOU NEED TO
ELIMINATE THE VERY MAN

30:29.528 --> 30:31.360
YOU'D NORMALLY CALL
FOR THE JOB...

30:31.360 --> 30:34.563
OH, AND WHEN I FULLY EXPOSE
THAT KIDNAPPING STORY

30:34.563 --> 30:37.066
FOR THE COMPELLING FICTION
THAT IT WAS,

30:37.066 --> 30:39.368
THE AUTHORITIES WILL NOT ONLY
HAVE EVIDENCE,

30:39.368 --> 30:41.410
THEY'LL HAVE
VERY CONCRETE MOTIVE.

30:41.410 --> 30:43.342
(Ashley) VICTORIA,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

30:43.342 --> 30:44.413
NO, I'M NOT.

30:44.413 --> 30:46.115
HOW COULD THEY THINK
HE WOULD DO SUCH A THING?

30:46.115 --> 30:47.276
WHY DON'T YOU EXPLAIN, MOM?

30:47.276 --> 30:49.378
SINCE YOU KNEW ABOUT
DAD'S ARREST HOURS AGO.

30:49.378 --> 30:52.421
YOUR LITTLE PEP TALK
ON THE DANCE FLOOR?

30:52.421 --> 30:55.624
(police radio chatter)

30:55.624 --> 30:57.586
I DIDN'T REALIZE
THAT YOUR SON

30:57.586 --> 30:59.458
HAD STOOPED
TO DATING THE HELP.

30:59.458 --> 31:01.490
THAT'S QUITE A DOWNGRADE
FROM EMILY THORNE.

31:01.490 --> 31:03.432
WHY, IT JUST GOES
TO SHOW, MASON,

31:03.432 --> 31:04.563
IF YOU KNEW ANYTHING AT ALL,

31:04.563 --> 31:06.095
YOU WOULD KNOW
THAT EMILY THORNE,

31:06.095 --> 31:07.436
DESPITE
HER SIZEABLE POCKETBOOK,

31:07.436 --> 31:10.499
IS NOTHING BUT A JUVIE GIRL
WHO CLEANED UP NICELY.

31:10.499 --> 31:12.501
JUVIE GIRL?

31:12.501 --> 31:15.945
OFFICERS, ESCORT THIS MAN
OFF MY PROPERTY.

31:15.945 --> 31:18.577
AND IF HE RETURNS, HAVE HIM
ARRESTED FOR TRESPASSING.

31:18.577 --> 31:20.309
I ASSURE YOU
THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY.

31:20.309 --> 31:22.881
I'VE SUDDENLY
GOT SOME WORK TO DO.

31:22.881 --> 31:24.213
(police radio chatter)

31:24.213 --> 31:26.215
(buzzer, door clanks)

31:26.215 --> 31:30.289
(footsteps approach)

31:30.289 --> 31:33.162
HELLO, CONRAD.

31:35.094 --> 31:38.327
I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION
WHEN WE LAST SPOKE

31:38.327 --> 31:40.329
THAT YOU UNDERSTOOD
OUR INTENTION

31:40.329 --> 31:43.302
OF MANAGING THE SITUATION
WITH MR. MURPHY,

31:43.302 --> 31:46.405
AS EVERYONE IS SO FOND
OF CALLING HIM,

31:46.405 --> 31:48.307
IN-HOUSE.

31:48.307 --> 31:50.379
COME ON. YOU OF ALL PEOPLE KNOW
I DIDN'T KILL THAT MAN.

31:50.379 --> 31:52.081
YOU SET ME UP THE SAME WAY

31:52.081 --> 31:54.413
YOU TRIED TO SET ME UP
THE FIRST TIME AROUND.

31:54.413 --> 31:56.515
HAD IT NOT BEEN
FOR DAVID CLARKE--

31:56.515 --> 31:58.147
LET'S MOVE FORWARD,
SHALL WE?

31:59.618 --> 32:02.591
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

32:02.591 --> 32:04.453
WELL, YOUR UNIQUE POSITION

32:04.453 --> 32:08.497
AND THE FINANCIAL SERVICES
YOU WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE TO US

32:08.497 --> 32:11.260
WORKED OUT SO WELL
IN THE PAST...

32:11.260 --> 32:13.102

YOU WERE GONNA USE THEM

32:13.102 --> 32:14.563
TO BLOW UP A JETLINER.

32:14.563 --> 32:16.405
NOR WILL HAVE YOU ANY IDEA

32:16.405 --> 32:18.467
WHAT WE HAVE PLANNED
THIS TIME AROUND.

32:18.467 --> 32:22.411
SO IT SEEMS YOU HAVE
A CHOICE TO MAKE.

32:23.973 --> 32:27.446

YOUR SERVICE?

32:35.484 --> 32:36.655
IT'S NOW OR NEVER.

32:36.655 --> 32:38.027
FIRST THING MONDAY,
WE ASSEMBLE THE BOARD

32:38.027 --> 32:39.258
FOR A VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE
ON MY FATHER.

32:39.258 --> 32:41.260
MONDAY? WELL, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH TOMORROW?

32:41.260 --> 32:43.192
LET'S INTERRUPT SOME TEE TIMES.
WHY WAIT?

32:43.192 --> 32:44.393
BECAUSE WE CAN STILL BE
AGGRESSIVE

32:44.393 --> 32:45.564
WITHOUT SEEMING DESPERATE.

32:45.564 --> 32:47.096
OKAY. RIGHT YOU ARE.

32:47.096 --> 32:48.737
UM, I'LL SPEAK TO YOU

TO BE A KING.

32:57.306 --> 32:58.677

32:58.677 --> 33:00.349

ABOUT THIS ONE?

33:01.550 --> 33:03.252
ASHLEY?

33:03.252 --> 33:05.384
I MET HER SIX YEARS AGO.
SHE WAS AN EASY MARK.

33:05.384 --> 33:07.556
SURE SHE WASN'T
TOO EASY?

33:07.556 --> 33:09.118

DOING HERE?

NO. YOU THINK I'M GONNA

ON YOUR OWN?

33:24.403 --> 33:26.375
NOT THIS TIME.

33:26.375 --> 33:27.706
I'M NOT REACHING

YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT.

33:29.178 --> 33:30.679
NO, THAT'S NOT WHY
I CAME HERE.

33:30.679 --> 33:34.213

I'M NOT GLAD YOU CAME.

33:34.213 --> 33:37.086

33:37.086 --> 33:39.518

33:39.518 --> 33:42.591
THE ONLY TIME I REMEMBER
BEING HAPPY THIS LAST YEAR

33:42.591 --> 33:46.024
WAS WHEN I WAS WITH YOU.

HAVE TO FACE HIM AGAIN."

34:15.154 --> 34:16.625
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID
TO ME.

34:16.625 --> 34:19.588
ALMOST AS IF
YOU KNEW THE FUTURE.

34:19.588 --> 34:21.389
THAT MAN WAS A KILLER.

34:21.389 --> 34:24.163
HE KIDNAPPED ME
AND HE THREATENED MY FAMILY.

34:24.163 --> 34:25.293

BUT I'M NOT
GIVING UP ON YOU.

40:40.569 --> 40:44.743
I'M JUST GONNA HAVE TO TRUST
THAT YOU WON'T GIVE UP ON ME.

40:48.216 --> 40:51.480
(sighs)
 (Massive Attack's
"Paradise Circus" playing)

40:53.822 --> 40:56.024
TO SUCCESSFULLY
CREATE ILLUSION,

40:56.024 --> 40:59.658
THE FIRST THING YOU NEED
IS TRUST.

40:59.658 --> 41:01.189
BUT TO PERFECT AN ILLUSION,

41:01.189 --> 41:03.832
THE FALSE REALITY MUST APPEAR
AS AUTHENTIC

41:03.832 --> 41:05.634
AS THE ONE IT HIDES.

41:05.634 --> 41:07.696
♪ IT'S UNFORTUNATE ♪

41:07.696 --> 41:12.641
♪ THAT WHEN WE FEEL A STORM ♪

41:12.641 --> 41:15.804
♪ WE CAN ROLL OURSELVES OVER ♪

41:15.804 --> 41:19.748

41:19.748 --> 41:22.611

41:22.611 --> 41:26.815

41:26.815 --> 41:28.757

41:28.757 --> 41:31.620

41:31.620 --> 41:34.523

41:34.523 --> 41:35.864

41:41.499 --> 41:43.972

LIKE A FLY ♪

41:43.972 --> 41:46.805
♪ WILL NEVER LOVE YOU ♪

41:55.584 --> 42:00.749
CAREFUL ATTENTION MUST BE PAID
TO EVERY DETAIL.

42:00.749 --> 42:04.853
THE SLIGHTEST OF IMPERFECTIONS
CAN, LIKE A PIN TO A BALLOON,

42:04.853 --> 42:07.726
BURST THE ILLUSION.

42:07.726 --> 42:09.527
(crickets chirping)

42:09.527 --> 42:12.200
EMILY THORNE.

42:14.262 --> 42:16.805
ALLENWOOD.

42:21.640 --> 42:24.172
AMANDA CLARKE.

42:24.172 --> 42:26.174
AND THE TRUTH
BEHIND THE ILLUSION

42:26.174 --> 42:28.146
BECOMES REVEALED.
