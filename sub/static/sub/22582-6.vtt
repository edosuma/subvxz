00:56.087 --> 00:59.397
- Is it them?
- I don't know.

01:00.247 --> 01:02.715
No, it's not their ship.

01:03.887 --> 01:05.605
It's someone else.

01:22.847 --> 01:24.599
It's been a long road

01:26.967 --> 01:29.197
Gettin' from there to here

01:29.967 --> 01:32.765
It's been a long time

01:33.567 --> 01:37.037
But my time is finally near

01:37.527 --> 01:40.917
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

01:41.767 --> 01:44.600
I will touch the sky

01:45.047 --> 01:48.437
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

01:48.567 --> 01:51.559
No, they're not gonna change my mind

01:51.687 --> 01:55.965
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

01:56.167 --> 01:59.204
I'm going where my heart will take me

01:59.327 --> 02:03.479
I've got faith to believe

02:03.607 --> 02:06.565
I can do anything

02:06.727 --> 02:10.401
I've got strength of the soul

02:11.007 --> 02:13.999
And no one's gonna bend or break me

02:14.127 --> 02:18.325
I can reach any star

02:19.767 --> 02:21.758
I've got faith

02:23.367 --> 02:26.484
I've got faith

02:27.207 --> 02:30.483
Faith of the heart

02:59.127 --> 03:02.039
My name's Captain Archer
from the Starship Enterprise.

03:02.607 --> 03:04.802
We tried to hail you,
but there was no response.

03:04.927 --> 03:06.724
Our communications are down.

03:07.367 --> 03:09.801
That must make it difficult
to do business.

03:13.047 --> 03:16.437
A Kreetassan merchant told us
this was a deuterium facility.

03:16.567 --> 03:17.716
He was correct.

03:17.847 --> 03:19.599
Our ship took some damage
a few weeks ago.

03:19.727 --> 03:22.719
- We lost most of our reserves.
- I'm sorry, but we can't help you.

03:22.847 --> 03:25.361
Two of our pumps are off-line.

03:25.727 --> 03:27.524
You'll have to return later in the season.

03:27.647 --> 03:29.638
Our supply will be gone
in less than two weeks.

03:29.767 --> 03:32.884
- There's nothing we can do.
- Are you certain?

03:33.007 --> 03:37.239
You seem to have a large inventory.
Our sensors showed over 80,000 litres.

03:37.367 --> 03:38.641
You scanned our tanks?

03:38.767 --> 03:41.998
I apologise, but when you didn't
respond to our hails...

03:44.407 --> 03:46.716
You sure you couldn't
spare a few hundred litres?

03:46.847 --> 03:48.360
We're holding that for someone else.

03:48.487 --> 03:51.684
Come back at the end of the season.
We'll be able to accommodate you.

03:51.807 --> 03:54.765
Do you have any experience
repairing extraction pumps?

03:55.847 --> 03:59.999
Not specifically, but I could grab
some tools and take a look.

04:00.127 --> 04:03.005
We get those pumps operating,
we can make our quota.

04:03.407 --> 04:07.195
It seems that there might be
an opportunity for us to help each other.

04:10.007 --> 04:11.998
Follow me.

04:43.407 --> 04:45.318
What are you doing in my chair?

04:47.127 --> 04:48.958
I didn't touch anything.

04:49.087 --> 04:52.523
I just like to look inside
the ships that come here.

04:52.967 --> 04:56.039
- Well, you should have asked.
- You might have said no.

04:57.407 --> 04:59.363
Well...

05:00.567 --> 05:02.046
what do you think?

05:02.767 --> 05:04.439
It's a little small...

05:04.567 --> 05:07.081
and your thruster controls
are hard to reach.

05:08.407 --> 05:10.443
Maybe you need longer arms.

05:12.647 --> 05:14.399
How fast can it go?

05:14.527 --> 05:17.121
She's designed
for one-quarter impulse, but...

05:17.887 --> 05:20.117
I've been able to squeeze
a little more out of her.

05:20.247 --> 05:22.715
- You're a pilot?
- Engineer.

05:22.847 --> 05:25.077
- Commander Trip Tucker.
- Q'ell.

05:25.927 --> 05:29.078
- Nice to meet you.
- Could you teach me how to fly it?

05:30.047 --> 05:33.244
I can drive the crawler
that we use to move our drill rigs.

05:33.767 --> 05:37.203
Tell you what.
I'll be heading back up to the ship later.

05:37.327 --> 05:40.239
You can come along,
if it's all right with your folks.

05:40.367 --> 05:42.881
- I'll give you a tour.
- Really?

05:44.767 --> 05:48.077
- Two power cells.
- We need six.

05:49.367 --> 05:51.119
We can't spare that many.

05:52.567 --> 05:53.920
Maybe three.

05:54.047 --> 05:56.163
Do you have any idea
how much labour it takes...

05:56.287 --> 06:00.599
- to refine a litre of deuterium?
- Actually, no.

06:01.647 --> 06:04.036
I'd enjoy seeing how your facility works.

06:04.407 --> 06:06.363
We have three months
of good weather, Captain.

06:06.487 --> 06:10.036
Three months to pump all the deuterium
we can before the winter.

06:10.487 --> 06:12.523
We don't have time to give tours.

06:13.487 --> 06:16.638
Five power cells for 200 litres.
I can't do any better.

06:19.927 --> 06:21.963
Our medical stores are running low.

06:25.807 --> 06:27.479
Four power cells...

06:28.247 --> 06:30.283
and whatever medical supplies
we can spare.

06:34.407 --> 06:38.878
All right.
But only if you can repair our pumps.

06:39.007 --> 06:42.079
Commander Tucker
and his team will do the best they can.

06:42.207 --> 06:44.516
I expect you to leave orbit in two days.

06:44.647 --> 06:47.286
If the pumps are working,
you'll leave with your deuterium.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.318
If not, you'll leave without it.

06:50.327 --> 06:51.476
Are we agreed?

06:53.727 --> 06:54.762
Agreed.

07:00.687 --> 07:04.885
- It's yours, if you'd like it.
- I wouldn't know what to feed it.

07:05.527 --> 07:10.203
Her needs are modest.
A nutrient broth every three or four days.

07:10.327 --> 07:12.283
- Less often when she's working.
- Working?

07:12.407 --> 07:16.082
She will ingest a little blood
while she's healing an injured artery.

07:16.647 --> 07:20.560
Thank you, but I'll just take
some vascular adhesive.

07:22.127 --> 07:25.517
Try this, instead.

07:29.327 --> 07:33.400
- An auto-suture.
- I'm surprised you don't have one.

07:33.887 --> 07:36.276
This is a very expensive
piece of equipment.

07:36.407 --> 07:38.875
- I can't...
- Nonsense. Please.

07:43.327 --> 07:46.046
Cardio-stimulator, neural shock kit.

07:47.007 --> 07:50.477
I had no idea processing deuterium
was such a dangerous business.

07:51.047 --> 07:52.639
It can be.

07:53.487 --> 07:58.277
I've only heard of hexatriol being used
to treat serious plasma burns.

07:59.407 --> 08:03.195
Deuterium can burn almost
as hot as plasma when it's ignited.

08:04.047 --> 08:05.480
I hope you won't need it.

08:09.007 --> 08:12.363
- Is there something wrong?
- No.

08:16.487 --> 08:19.638
- I'd better get back.
- Of course.

08:23.607 --> 08:24.835
Thank you again.

08:31.687 --> 08:34.599
You've been to other colonies
that trade deuterium, haven't you?

08:34.727 --> 08:36.240
Several.

08:36.687 --> 08:39.804
- Are they all this rustic?
- Not usually.

08:40.407 --> 08:41.999
Their equipment's falling apart.

08:42.126 --> 08:44.766
Half these structures look like
they're about to collapse.

08:44.887 --> 08:48.596
Phlox tells me they don't even have
basic medical supplies.

08:50.767 --> 08:53.122
Deuterium is a
highly valuable commodity.

08:54.127 --> 08:56.641
You'd think these people
would be better off.

08:57.407 --> 09:00.877
We're here to trade with them,
not judge their living conditions.

09:01.487 --> 09:04.843
And why do they need us
to finish fixing their pumps in two days?

09:04.967 --> 09:06.798
What's the hurry?

09:08.887 --> 09:11.242
Lieutenant,
a ship just dropped out of warp.

09:11.367 --> 09:14.359
- 600,000 kilometres and closing.
- I see her.

09:15.287 --> 09:18.245
It's probably more deuterium customers.

09:19.127 --> 09:22.085
I'm reading twelve bio-signs,
all Klingon.

09:37.247 --> 09:39.522
You'll want to keep an eye
on those phase-inverters.

09:39.647 --> 09:41.239
They tend to depolarise.

09:42.327 --> 09:45.524
- Pump six.
- Korok's ship is entering orbit.

09:45.647 --> 09:48.241
- I thought we had three more days.
- Secure the pumps.

09:48.367 --> 09:50.244
Get everyone inside.

09:50.367 --> 09:53.916
- Some kind of trouble?
- Help me close these induction valves.

09:58.287 --> 10:01.120
What's going on? Who's Korok?

10:05.447 --> 10:08.041
They must realise
that you trade with other ships.

10:08.167 --> 10:10.886
They believe that
we have an exclusive arrangement.

10:11.007 --> 10:14.317
If they think anyone's been here
before them, they get very angry.

10:14.447 --> 10:18.235
Please, don't get involved.

10:18.567 --> 10:19.966
We'll talk to them.

10:27.487 --> 10:30.399
- Archer to Enterprise.
- Go ahead, Captain.

10:30.527 --> 10:32.483
Have the Klingons
detected Enterprise yet?

10:34.647 --> 10:35.635
No indication, sir.

10:39.326 --> 10:42.159
Travis, adjust your orbit.

10:42.286 --> 10:44.846
- Keep Enterprise out of sight.
- Aye, sir.

11:10.126 --> 11:12.401
My old friend.

11:14.366 --> 11:16.277
We weren't expecting you so soon.

11:16.406 --> 11:18.920
We've had trouble
with two of our pumps.

11:19.046 --> 11:22.721
My crew's hungry.
Let's have food and drink.

11:22.846 --> 11:25.041
Then we'll discuss business.

11:31.126 --> 11:33.959
Your deuterium. We don't have all of it.

11:35.726 --> 11:38.559
We did our best but we need more time.

11:41.806 --> 11:44.479
Can you make out what they're saying?

11:45.286 --> 11:48.801
Tessic is explaining
that their yield isn't what they hoped.

11:50.486 --> 11:51.839
Good ears.

11:52.886 --> 11:56.162
Without those pumps,
we couldn't operate at full capacity.

11:56.846 --> 12:01.601
I sense what you're about to say
is not going to make me happy.

12:03.446 --> 12:06.199
We can give you 80,000 litres.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.521
If you give us one more week,
we'll have the rest.

12:08.646 --> 12:12.434
You've had enough time.
We'll take all of it, now!

12:12.566 --> 12:14.363
We don't have it.

12:14.486 --> 12:18.764
- I told you, two pumps were down.
- They all appear to be working.

12:20.286 --> 12:23.005
- We were just able to repair them.
- You're lying!

12:23.886 --> 12:26.878
Leave him alone.
You'll get your deuterium.

12:31.486 --> 12:33.875
Wait, please.

12:37.886 --> 12:40.241
I can get deuterium anywhere.

12:40.966 --> 12:43.958
I come here because I like you...

12:44.086 --> 12:48.238
when you show me
hospitality and respect.

12:48.366 --> 12:52.518
You take everything we own,
and you want us to respect you?

12:58.806 --> 13:02.037
I'll give you four days. Have it all ready.

13:17.926 --> 13:19.405
Let's get him inside.

13:36.846 --> 13:39.883
- So this is your exclusive arrangement?
- It's not your concern.

13:40.006 --> 13:42.600
How long have these bullies
been pushing you around?

13:42.726 --> 13:43.920
Five seasons.

13:44.046 --> 13:46.480
They take all the first-yield deuterium
we can extract.

13:46.606 --> 13:48.915
- Hold still.
- After they leave...

13:49.046 --> 13:52.038
we manage to pull a few thousand
litres out of the deep strata...

13:52.166 --> 13:55.476
but it takes weeks, and it's full of
impurities. We can barely refine it.

13:55.606 --> 13:56.959
It still brings in a decent price.

13:57.086 --> 13:58.804
We make enough
to get through the winter.

13:58.926 --> 14:00.075
Barely.

14:00.206 --> 14:02.162
Have you tried contacting
your home world?

14:02.286 --> 14:04.925
- It's too far away.
- You must have weapons.

14:05.046 --> 14:08.482
Some way to defend yourselves.
How many of them are there?

14:10.166 --> 14:13.522
- Usually seven.
- Seven?

14:14.406 --> 14:17.398
You've got them outnumbered,
nine or 10 to one.

14:17.526 --> 14:20.165
You've never seen a Klingon in battle,
have you?

14:21.086 --> 14:24.761
We tried to stand up to them once,
three seasons ago.

14:25.486 --> 14:27.875
Five of us died fighting them.

14:28.006 --> 14:31.999
Then they killed three more,
to prove their point.

14:33.326 --> 14:35.078
One of them was his father.

14:38.326 --> 14:40.396
Maybe there's something we can do.

14:43.726 --> 14:46.001
Just take your 200 litres and go.

14:46.126 --> 14:49.004
If you're here when they come back,
they'll kill you.

14:52.406 --> 14:55.443
- Mr. Reed?
- The Klingon ship's gone to warp, sir.

14:55.566 --> 14:57.238
I'm sending a shuttlepod down.

14:57.366 --> 14:59.243
We'll be at the landing site.

15:16.926 --> 15:19.201
I'll catch up with you later, Captain.

15:31.366 --> 15:33.755
Sorry, I never got to give you that tour.

15:34.006 --> 15:37.794
I once saw a Kellenite ship
with cannons and torpedoes.

15:38.446 --> 15:41.802
- Most big ships carry weapons.
- Like Enterprise?

15:44.086 --> 15:46.281
Yeah, like Enterprise.

15:46.566 --> 15:49.558
You could have fought the Klingons.
Beaten them.

15:53.166 --> 15:56.203
- Maybe.
- Why didn't you try?

15:58.406 --> 16:00.124
It's not that simple.

16:08.366 --> 16:09.481
Come in.

16:14.166 --> 16:16.680
The deuterium's been stowed.
200 litres.

16:20.846 --> 16:23.679
Should I instruct Ensign Mayweather
to break orbit?

16:25.886 --> 16:27.604
So that's it?

16:28.326 --> 16:30.556
We just take our deuterium and leave?

16:34.766 --> 16:37.883
They work their asses off
to provide for their families...

16:38.006 --> 16:40.725
and then the Klingons just stroll in
and rob them blind.

16:40.846 --> 16:42.757
Does that seem right to you?

16:43.086 --> 16:47.443
Malcolm tells me that Klingon ship
isn't much more than a freighter.

16:48.246 --> 16:50.476
I'd lay odds
they're no match for Enterprise.

16:50.606 --> 16:52.358
And if they withdraw?

16:53.006 --> 16:55.964
What will keep them from coming back
after we've gone?

16:58.486 --> 17:01.205
We could try to contact
the Klingon High Council.

17:02.206 --> 17:04.766
We saved Klaang from the Suliban.

17:04.886 --> 17:08.037
We pulled one of their battle cruisers
out of a gas giant.

17:08.965 --> 17:10.843
I say they owe us a favour.

17:12.086 --> 17:15.157
I doubt these marauders
answer to the High Council.

17:15.286 --> 17:18.642
I already know where Vulcans stand
on interfering with other cultures...

17:18.766 --> 17:20.279
but this isn't a culture.

17:20.406 --> 17:22.761
76 settlers are being preyed upon.

17:23.366 --> 17:24.719
If this were an Earth colony...

17:24.846 --> 17:27.838
I'd be grateful if someone showed up
to give me a hand.

17:30.246 --> 17:33.556
Captain, this may surprise you,
but I agree.

17:35.086 --> 17:37.884
However, short of killing the Klingons...

17:38.006 --> 17:41.476
any action we take
will only make the situation worse.

17:43.326 --> 17:47.444
I just hate the idea of turning our backs.

18:03.566 --> 18:05.079
Need a hand?

18:08.246 --> 18:09.759
Control arm is jammed.

18:10.446 --> 18:12.914
I could use some help
with the release valve.

18:13.206 --> 18:16.004
- Okay.
- Turn it to the left.

18:21.006 --> 18:22.121
This one?

18:26.126 --> 18:29.323
Thought you'd be off charting
your next star system by now.

18:30.486 --> 18:33.478
Sometimes I have a bad habit
of overstaying my welcome.

18:34.606 --> 18:37.564
You obviously didn't come down
here in the middle of the night...

18:37.686 --> 18:39.483
to help me with this crawler.

18:39.606 --> 18:42.598
Seems to me this crawler
is the least of your problems.

18:44.446 --> 18:47.404
We've been through this before.
It's not your concern.

18:50.046 --> 18:51.479
Give it another turn.

18:55.966 --> 18:58.036
You said they've been
coming here for what?

18:58.166 --> 18:59.918
Five seasons?

19:00.766 --> 19:03.405
How long do you plan
on letting this go on? Another five?

19:03.526 --> 19:06.120
That's good. Leave it there.

19:10.686 --> 19:12.483
Reconnect this coolant line.

19:13.726 --> 19:15.318
Intake's above your head.

19:25.406 --> 19:27.636
I had a talk with my tactical officer.

19:29.166 --> 19:32.203
We're confident you have the ability
to defend yourselves.

19:32.326 --> 19:33.884
We already tried.

19:34.006 --> 19:37.282
There are eight people buried
not far from here who can attest to that.

19:37.406 --> 19:39.362
It would be different this time.

19:40.006 --> 19:42.281
- We would help you prepare.
- I don't want your help.

19:42.406 --> 19:45.523
I'm responsible for my people, not you.
They put their trust in me.

19:45.646 --> 19:48.365
They depend on me.
I'm supposed to protect them.

19:53.246 --> 19:54.679
Look at me.

19:56.526 --> 19:58.756
I can barely keep this crawler running.

20:03.886 --> 20:07.196
You say you and your tactical officer
want to help us.

20:07.606 --> 20:11.076
Even if you do, once you're gone,
we'll be alone again...

20:11.326 --> 20:13.237
waiting for them to come back.

20:17.046 --> 20:19.002
There's a saying on my world.

20:22.526 --> 20:25.643
"Give a man a fish,
and he eats for a day...

20:27.366 --> 20:31.439
"teach him to fish,
and he eats for a lifetime."

20:40.126 --> 20:42.356
I was hoping for a bit more to work with.

20:42.486 --> 20:44.795
They do a decent job
keeping the shib'a lizards...

20:44.926 --> 20:46.439
from chewing on the power couplings.

20:46.566 --> 20:48.522
With a few modifications...

20:48.646 --> 20:51.206
these should be effective
against more than lizards.

20:51.326 --> 20:54.204
You must have a well-stocked armoury
on board Enterprise.

20:54.326 --> 20:56.601
This battle won't be won with firepower.

20:56.726 --> 21:00.401
Deception and surprise
can be just as potent as brute force.

21:00.526 --> 21:02.835
Klingons are aggressive warriors...

21:02.966 --> 21:04.922
but their tactics are crude.

21:05.046 --> 21:07.879
They're slow to adapt
to changing circumstances.

21:08.006 --> 21:10.839
This all sounds very ambitious.

21:11.126 --> 21:13.162
What exactly
are you expecting us to do?

21:13.286 --> 21:15.516
You're going to lure them into a trap.

21:16.766 --> 21:19.758
- What kind of trap?
- A very hot one.

21:20.126 --> 21:23.084
The deuterium in those well-heads,
how much pressure is it under?

21:23.206 --> 21:26.039
- 3,000, 4,000 millibars?
- 5,000.

21:27.046 --> 21:29.082
Should create
some interesting fireworks.

21:29.206 --> 21:32.243
You'll never get the Klingons
near that deuterium field.

21:32.366 --> 21:33.640
They know it isn't safe.

21:33.766 --> 21:35.757
They may be crude,
but they're not fools.

21:35.886 --> 21:38.525
That's where deception
and surprise come in.

21:38.646 --> 21:41.763
- Did you bring the map I asked you for?
- It's right here.

21:45.966 --> 21:48.924
The structures in the colony.
They're mostly modular, right?

21:49.046 --> 21:50.365
They're all modular.

21:50.486 --> 21:54.115
Most deuterium fields are depleted
within three or four years at most.

21:54.246 --> 21:55.964
It forces us to be itinerant.

21:56.086 --> 22:00.125
You're saying you could relocate these
buildings in a relatively short time?

22:00.686 --> 22:03.120
That depends where you're suggesting
we relocate them.

22:03.246 --> 22:06.079
About 50 metres to the south,
right here.

22:06.406 --> 22:07.441
What good would that do?

22:07.566 --> 22:10.285
The terrain there is no different
than where the town is now.

22:10.406 --> 22:11.725
That's what we're counting on.

22:11.846 --> 22:14.235
If we can move the structures
and the rigs...

22:14.366 --> 22:17.483
everything should look pretty much
like it did yesterday.

22:17.766 --> 22:20.485
Everything except the well-heads.

22:20.846 --> 22:23.838
They'll have to be capped off,
and camouflaged.

22:25.246 --> 22:26.440
We can do that.

22:27.606 --> 22:31.804
The gullies on this hillside,
are they deep enough to hide in?

22:32.646 --> 22:34.364
If you keep your head down.

22:34.806 --> 22:39.004
We'll shuttle small groups to Enterprise
for whatever training we have time for...

22:39.126 --> 22:42.038
preferably people who have experience
with weapons.

22:43.366 --> 22:45.800
We've got three days.
We should get to work.

22:48.886 --> 22:50.956
What are we waiting for?

23:20.086 --> 23:21.758
One more metre.

23:22.966 --> 23:24.763
Okay, shut her down.

23:27.286 --> 23:28.321
You ready?

23:34.486 --> 23:36.602
And, begin.

23:48.566 --> 23:51.319
Shib'a lizards don't move that fast.

23:51.446 --> 23:53.880
Do you mind, Lieutenant?

23:54.886 --> 23:57.719
I can see your finger tensing
on the trigger before you fire.

23:57.846 --> 24:01.555
It's throwing off your aim.
I used to make the same mistake.

24:01.886 --> 24:03.558
Keep your eye on the target...

24:03.686 --> 24:07.042
and don't squeeze the trigger
until you have a clear shot.

24:11.246 --> 24:12.281
Try again.

24:23.006 --> 24:25.964
I think the table
was a little bit to the left.

24:26.966 --> 24:28.194
Thanks.

24:28.526 --> 24:32.439
- How are things going with the pumps?
- It'll be tomorrow before they're in place.

24:32.566 --> 24:35.080
We started capping off the heads.

24:36.046 --> 24:37.638
Let me know...

24:37.806 --> 24:39.285
I got it.

24:39.886 --> 24:43.276
...if you need more people.
- I rigged two ignition sequences.

24:43.406 --> 24:46.603
The perimeter and the centre
are on separate circuits.

24:47.086 --> 24:49.441
I thought taking the town apart
was tough.

24:51.166 --> 24:53.043
But putting it back together...

24:53.366 --> 24:56.403
This plan is a long shot. Isn't it?

25:00.686 --> 25:02.483
Do you think it's a mistake?

25:03.206 --> 25:04.525
I didn't say that.

25:09.326 --> 25:14.116
I've never liked bullies, Trip.
Not on Earth... and not out here.

25:18.006 --> 25:20.839
Klingons carry disruptors...

25:20.966 --> 25:24.561
but they prefer to use
bladed weapons in combat.

25:25.046 --> 25:27.321
The two most common being...

25:27.446 --> 25:31.234
the bat'leth, a curved, bilateral sword...

25:31.886 --> 25:36.118
and the mek'leth, a two-pronged dagger.

25:36.926 --> 25:41.124
The bat'leth can decapitate its victim
with one stroke...

25:41.726 --> 25:45.958
while the mek'leth is typically used
to slash the throat...

25:46.686 --> 25:48.358
or disembowel.

25:50.846 --> 25:54.475
I cannot teach you to defend yourselves
against these weapons.

25:55.166 --> 25:58.203
The Vulcan martial art, Suus Mahna...

25:58.566 --> 26:00.397
takes years to master.

26:00.526 --> 26:05.281
However, I can teach you
a simple evasive technique.

26:05.406 --> 26:07.442
Ensign Mayweather.

26:07.566 --> 26:11.844
Since I don't have a bat'leth,
this will have to suffice.

26:12.606 --> 26:14.278
Try to strike me.

26:17.406 --> 26:21.399
- You won't hurt me.
- It's not you that I'm worried about.

26:29.126 --> 26:32.755
That was called the Navorkot.
It isn't difficult to learn.

26:34.526 --> 26:36.323
Who would like to try first?

26:56.606 --> 26:57.675
Thanks.

27:03.326 --> 27:05.237
Lieutenant Reed said I'd have to hide
in the canyons...

27:05.366 --> 27:06.958
when the Klingons come back.

27:07.086 --> 27:09.281
He doesn't want you to get hurt.

27:11.806 --> 27:13.319
But I want to help.

27:13.446 --> 27:16.279
I could shoot a shib'a lizard
from 40 metres.

27:17.646 --> 27:19.523
Malcolm's got this rule.

27:19.966 --> 27:22.560
You've got to be taller
than the gun to use it.

27:23.966 --> 27:25.638
I don't want to hide.

27:28.006 --> 27:31.316
Shooting at a lizard is a whole lot
different than shooting at a person.

27:31.446 --> 27:32.925
And...

27:33.286 --> 27:34.924
lizards don't shoot back.

27:38.366 --> 27:40.243
When those Klingons show up...

27:40.726 --> 27:43.365
I want you to do exactly
what Lieutenant Reed says.

27:43.966 --> 27:45.035
Understood?

27:46.486 --> 27:47.555
Yes, sir.

28:33.486 --> 28:36.159
We had a little trouble moving
one of the pumps.

28:36.606 --> 28:38.995
But it's in place now.

28:39.446 --> 28:40.561
We're ready.

28:43.166 --> 28:45.202
I just hope everyone survives this.

28:48.086 --> 28:49.917
Your people, as well as mine.

28:53.006 --> 28:55.964
We left Earth just over a year ago...

28:57.246 --> 29:00.795
to explore, to meet people like you.

29:08.206 --> 29:09.924
Found ourselves in a...

29:10.406 --> 29:12.795
full-fledged fire fight with some...

29:13.046 --> 29:15.480
pretty nasty characters
called the Suliban.

29:15.806 --> 29:17.205
I got shot in the leg.

29:17.326 --> 29:20.682
Just before I passed out,
I remembered thinking:

29:21.566 --> 29:23.636
"This isn't what I signed up for.

29:24.726 --> 29:26.762
"I should be mapping star clusters or...

29:27.246 --> 29:29.680
"making first contact
with friendly species."

29:32.366 --> 29:35.244
But when those Suliban started
firing at my crew...

29:38.326 --> 29:42.319
I knew I didn't have any choice
but to fight back.

29:43.926 --> 29:47.680
I'm not ashamed to admit I was nervous.
I'm nervous now.

29:50.086 --> 29:51.201
But I know...

29:52.966 --> 29:54.160
we can do this.

30:05.085 --> 30:06.154
Archer.

30:06.285 --> 30:09.118
The Klingon ship just dropped
out of warp, Captain.

30:17.405 --> 30:18.554
Acknowledged.

30:57.765 --> 30:58.800
Listen.

31:00.325 --> 31:01.360
To what?

31:03.085 --> 31:04.120
The pumps.

31:05.805 --> 31:06.999
They're silent.

31:12.085 --> 31:14.041
Where's your hospitality?

31:18.085 --> 31:21.361
This is no way to treat your friends!

31:24.445 --> 31:25.958
Show yourselves!

32:25.165 --> 32:27.884
This will cost you more than deuterium!

33:33.925 --> 33:34.960
Hey!

33:54.605 --> 33:55.594
Come on.

34:09.485 --> 34:10.520
There.

34:12.804 --> 34:14.204
What are you doing?

34:15.125 --> 34:19.118
You'll kill us all. Those well-heads,
they're under great pressure.

34:19.685 --> 34:22.324
If you ignite them,
you'll incinerate the whole town.

34:22.445 --> 34:24.322
They're making fools of us.

34:37.804 --> 34:39.955
They're hiding in the dirt like Targ.

34:43.965 --> 34:47.514
They'll learn to show us respect.
We'll kill another four.

34:48.804 --> 34:50.601
Perhaps the boy as well.

34:58.285 --> 34:59.354
Captain.

35:12.165 --> 35:13.678
They're too far south.

35:14.965 --> 35:17.923
We've got to get them to move
50 metres to our left.

35:18.045 --> 35:20.320
Everybody, this way.

35:46.525 --> 35:47.924
A little farther.

35:58.045 --> 35:59.194
This is good.

36:14.245 --> 36:15.883
A few more metres.

36:33.645 --> 36:35.237
This shouldn't be here.

36:36.005 --> 36:37.154
Now!

36:53.125 --> 36:54.797
They're all yours, Tessic.

37:01.885 --> 37:03.034
Korok!

37:05.285 --> 37:06.684
I wouldn't do that.

37:07.125 --> 37:09.514
There's two more well-heads
by your feet.

37:10.805 --> 37:13.000
Leave here now, or we'll ignite them!

37:14.765 --> 37:16.562
You'll live to regret this.

37:16.685 --> 37:20.280
If you're thinking about coming back,
I wouldn't advise it.

37:22.165 --> 37:23.644
We'll be ready.

37:25.805 --> 37:28.114
We're not afraid of you anymore.

37:33.165 --> 37:37.283
We can find deuterium anywhere.
Yours isn't fit for a garbage scow.

38:21.285 --> 38:23.640
Unless you're planning
to join Starfleet...

38:23.765 --> 38:26.279
I'm afraid you'll have
to give up that chair.

38:29.725 --> 38:31.681
I wish you didn't have to leave.

38:32.565 --> 38:35.204
Yeah, that's one of the tough things
about my job.

38:35.325 --> 38:38.442
Saying good-bye to people
like you and your friends.

38:40.885 --> 38:42.955
Oh, almost forgot.

38:49.645 --> 38:51.636
Schematics for Enterprise.

38:52.245 --> 38:54.884
You said you liked to look at starships.

38:56.325 --> 38:59.635
- This one will knock your socks off.
- Thanks.

39:03.205 --> 39:05.400
Do you think you'll come back?

39:08.925 --> 39:12.235
Who knows?
Our engines need a lot of deuterium.

39:13.885 --> 39:16.035
There must be over 1,000 litres here.

39:16.165 --> 39:17.200
2,000.

39:18.245 --> 39:19.439
Our deal was for 200.

39:19.565 --> 39:23.160
Our deal was for power cells,
medical supplies, and repair work.

39:24.765 --> 39:27.404
You provided us
with much more than that.

39:27.525 --> 39:30.278
Besides, we seem to have a surplus
for the moment.

39:31.525 --> 39:33.197
Give your crew our thanks.

39:34.045 --> 39:35.683
Have a good season.
