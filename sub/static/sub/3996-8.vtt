Meow.

00:21.409 --> 00:23.677
(door closes)

00:23.745 --> 00:24.978
Wait, wait.

00:25.046 --> 00:26.280
Are we really gonna do this?

00:26.348 --> 00:28.615
- Yes. Yes!
- Okay.

00:28.682 --> 00:31.851
♪ Intercourse,
intercourse. ♪

00:31.918 --> 00:33.319
Intercourse.

00:33.387 --> 00:34.654

Intercourse.

00:34.722 --> 00:35.821
(makes crowd noises)

00:35.889 --> 00:37.123
Sorry, that was weird.
(chuckles)

00:37.190 --> 00:38.491
No, no, no.
It's okay.

00:38.559 --> 00:39.692
I have to go to the loo.

00:39.760 --> 00:41.661
Okay.

00:43.229 --> 00:44.829
Hey, tiger.

00:44.897 --> 00:46.732
You're having sex tonight.

00:49.802 --> 00:52.070
Don't give me that look,
just do it.

00:54.206 --> 00:56.007
I'm sorry.

00:56.075 --> 00:57.676
No. You kidding?

00:57.744 --> 00:59.277
Don't worry about it.

00:59.344 --> 01:01.812
It's fine.

01:01.880 --> 01:03.781
I just haven't had
sex with anyone

01:03.848 --> 01:07.184
but Spencer in six years,
and I get so nervous.

01:07.252 --> 01:10.788
It's like starting a new job
with a really weird interview.

01:10.855 --> 01:12.723
Don't worry about it.
I'm good.

01:12.791 --> 01:14.191
I'm more than good.

01:14.259 --> 01:15.458
It's okay.

01:15.526 --> 01:16.626
You know what?

01:16.694 --> 01:17.761
Tomorrow night.

01:17.828 --> 01:18.961
Let's just go out to dinner

01:19.029 --> 01:20.597
and then just nail each other.

01:20.665 --> 01:22.031
Just pound each other.

01:22.099 --> 01:23.333
V-bomb on the P-bomb.

01:23.401 --> 01:24.834
(makes explosion noise)

01:24.902 --> 01:28.571
I would have the... P-bomb,
right?

That's what. Why wouldn't...

Yeah, okay.

Yeah, there's not a chance
I'm going.

01:47.456 --> 01:48.690
Can you not do
this to yourself?

01:48.757 --> 01:50.191
Look at your hair,
you look ridiculous.

01:50.258 --> 01:51.192
What am I supposed to talk
about for an hour?

01:51.259 --> 01:52.193
It's a haircut.

01:52.260 --> 01:53.761
No, you're trapped.

01:53.829 --> 01:55.430
You can't move,
and they're standing

01:55.497 --> 01:56.831
behind you with their hands

01:56.898 --> 01:57.865
in your hair, and they expect

01:57.933 --> 01:58.933
you to talk back.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.736
Oh, yeah, it's your baby.

02:01.804 --> 02:03.570
He's cute.

02:03.638 --> 02:06.005
Yeah, your baby's cute.

02:06.073 --> 02:08.407
Okay, I tell you what, man,
just come to my place.

02:08.476 --> 02:09.976
No, I'm not going to
a black barbershop, Winston.

02:10.044 --> 02:13.447
I've seen the movies;
I know how fast they talk.

02:13.514 --> 02:15.716
I don't need to seem
any less cool than I already do.

02:15.783 --> 02:16.750
Want to go to my salon?

02:16.818 --> 02:17.818
Hey, guys.

02:17.885 --> 02:19.785
- Hey.
- So, um...

02:19.853 --> 02:21.320
heads up, Paul's
coming tonight.

02:21.388 --> 02:23.121
And I just wanted to tell you

02:23.189 --> 02:25.257
that I'm gonna tap him
like a maple tree.

02:25.325 --> 02:26.659
I'm gonna be searching
for some syrups.

02:28.261 --> 02:29.528
I'm gonna be having sex
with him.

02:29.596 --> 02:30.463
- All right.
- All right, hey!

02:30.530 --> 02:31.497
Why are you telling us this?

02:31.498 --> 02:33.466
'Cause I want to.
I want to give you a heads up.

02:33.533 --> 02:35.000
You nervous?
You need tips?

02:35.068 --> 02:36.868
No, I'm not nervous.

02:36.935 --> 02:38.936
Just, you know,
I can drive stick.

02:39.004 --> 02:40.705
(chuckles)
Yeah, 'cause it seems like

02:40.773 --> 02:41.806
you're freaking out
a little bit.

02:41.874 --> 02:43.408
With this whole activity.

02:43.476 --> 02:44.843
That's not stick,
that's automatic.

02:44.910 --> 02:46.010
That's not automatic.

02:48.080 --> 02:50.014
Another bathroom break,
Schmidt?

02:50.082 --> 02:51.615
You know, I've been
timing you all day.

02:51.683 --> 02:53.149
Seven minutes and 23 seconds.

02:53.217 --> 02:55.018
I wonder what was
going on in there.

02:55.086 --> 02:57.020
Hmm? You pooped.

02:57.088 --> 02:58.355
Can you stop timing me, please?

02:58.423 --> 02:59.656
It's ridiculous
that you do that.

02:59.724 --> 03:00.657
I will break you.

03:00.725 --> 03:01.958
Hey, Lisa!

03:02.026 --> 03:03.660
You were on fire
last night, girl!

03:03.728 --> 03:04.728
I'm taking her job.

03:04.796 --> 03:06.730
What did you do last night?

03:06.798 --> 03:09.131
Everyone from the office went
to Jill's bachelorette party.

03:09.199 --> 03:10.800
Why don't I get invited places?

03:10.868 --> 03:12.568
Is it because I'm the only man
in the office?

03:12.636 --> 03:15.037
- "Man." That's adorable.
- How is it...

03:15.105 --> 03:15.938
You know, Sarah got promoted.

03:16.006 --> 03:16.972
Sarah?

03:17.040 --> 03:18.374
With the, with the gums?

03:18.442 --> 03:19.642
- Yeah.
- So she's out of the...

03:19.710 --> 03:21.544
That corner cubicle is free.

03:24.079 --> 03:25.046
(sighs)

03:25.114 --> 03:26.782
So much kick-back space.

03:26.849 --> 03:31.052
And, you know, Gina
personally invited me

03:31.120 --> 03:32.654
to her baby shower tonight.

03:32.722 --> 03:37.526
So that corner cubicle--
that's all mine.

03:37.593 --> 03:39.060
You like a Bond villain?

03:39.128 --> 03:40.594
You just told me
your whole plan.

03:43.364 --> 03:44.598
(chuckles)

03:47.035 --> 03:49.737
(British accent): Mr. Darcy's
going to love my new bonnet.

03:49.805 --> 03:52.039
Why are we here?

03:52.106 --> 03:53.607
You don't understand.

03:53.675 --> 03:55.108
You've never been
cheated on before.

03:55.176 --> 03:56.910
Spencer and I never
tried anything new,

03:56.977 --> 04:01.047
and maybe if I'd been...
more erotic...

04:01.114 --> 04:04.016
Spencer cheated on you
because he's a total jerk,

04:04.084 --> 04:05.351
not 'cause you're bad in bed.

04:05.419 --> 04:07.053
It's been six years.

04:07.120 --> 04:09.055
Everything I know about sex,
I learned from Spencer

04:09.122 --> 04:10.824
or the Clinton
impeachment trial.

04:10.891 --> 04:12.825
MAN:
He used a cigar as a sexual aid

04:12.892 --> 04:14.526
with her in
the Oval Office area...

04:14.594 --> 04:15.928
- WOMAN: Jess!
- Mom?!

04:16.495 --> 04:18.529
I'm not listening to NPR.

04:18.697 --> 04:20.096
(whistles)

04:20.098 --> 04:21.666
No. No whistle.

04:21.733 --> 04:23.602
It's terrible!

04:25.839 --> 04:27.072
Uh, <i>excusez-moi.</i>

04:27.139 --> 04:29.139
Can I try this on, please?

04:29.207 --> 04:30.842
Oh, the starfish.
You can't try that on.

04:30.909 --> 04:31.843
Health code.

04:32.310 --> 04:33.911
I'll take it!

04:33.979 --> 04:36.013
Ha!

04:36.081 --> 04:38.483
I hope Paul's packing
some coral polyps,

04:38.550 --> 04:41.051
'cause this starfish is hungry.

04:41.119 --> 04:41.986
(chuckles)

04:43.188 --> 04:44.355
Starfish eat coral polyps.

04:44.422 --> 04:46.089
Just pay, Jess.

04:46.156 --> 04:48.725
So today I'm gonna show you
how to cut your own hair.

04:48.793 --> 04:50.360
Uh, I consider myself...

04:50.427 --> 04:52.462
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What the hell
are you doing, Nick?

04:52.530 --> 04:54.698
It's a haircut!
Human interaction.

04:54.765 --> 04:57.200
You're a bartender, you talk
to strangers every single day.

04:57.267 --> 04:59.102
I don't like when they
touch my head, Winston.

04:59.169 --> 05:00.402
I don't like it.

05:00.470 --> 05:02.471
Go to the damn salon!

05:02.539 --> 05:04.039
No, it's fine, okay?

05:04.107 --> 05:05.541
I'm learning
how to do it myself.

05:05.609 --> 05:06.876
I'm learning from this video.

05:08.044 --> 05:09.645
(screaming)

05:09.713 --> 05:11.279
- Oh!
- Oh, my God, man!

05:11.347 --> 05:12.681
(screaming)

05:14.084 --> 05:15.584
I was wondering why
it had so many views.

05:15.651 --> 05:16.985
Let's watch it again.

05:18.052 --> 05:18.720
Hey.

05:18.787 --> 05:19.888
(chuckles) What?

05:19.955 --> 05:21.990
You know, Gina, I was
just walking by and, I mean,

05:22.058 --> 05:25.560
I was literally pulled in here
by the glow.

05:25.628 --> 05:28.363
- What do you want, Schmidt?
- I was just working my tail off

05:28.431 --> 05:30.465
at my cubicle, which, between
you and me, is surrounded

05:30.533 --> 05:32.333
by a couple of chatty Cathys.

05:32.401 --> 05:33.567
I mean, that's really
their names.

05:33.635 --> 05:34.801
It's Cathy S. and Cathy G.

05:34.869 --> 05:35.936
Anyway, they won't shut up

05:36.004 --> 05:37.438
about a baby shower tonight

05:37.506 --> 05:39.940
for a certain VP VP.

05:40.008 --> 05:43.911
"Very pregnant vice presidente."

05:43.978 --> 05:45.946
You're the worst.
Seriously, the worst.

05:45.954 --> 05:46.954
Get out.

05:46.981 --> 05:49.049
Gina, honestly,
it would mean so much to me

05:49.116 --> 05:51.418
if you would just let me
come to your baby shower.

05:51.485 --> 05:53.520
Okay, fine.
Come to my baby shower.

05:53.587 --> 05:55.388
- I can come? - Yeah.
- So I'm invited?

05:55.456 --> 05:56.722
- Yeah, you're invited.
- All right.

05:56.790 --> 05:57.824
I saw your registry.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.125
I'm gonna get you one of those
portable baby pumps.

05:59.193 --> 06:00.560
You're just out there

06:00.627 --> 06:02.361
in every day life,
but you're pumping yourself

06:02.429 --> 06:03.495
at the same time, you know.

06:03.563 --> 06:05.263
Just milking away. Just...
(makes shooting noises)

06:05.330 --> 06:06.997
- Get out.
- Okay, I'm gonna go.

06:09.135 --> 06:10.469
Why don't we meet here at 8:00?

06:10.537 --> 06:11.470
PAUL:
Great. Okay.

06:11.538 --> 06:12.904
Uh, where's the place?

06:12.972 --> 06:15.507
Um, I think it's in Koreatown.

06:16.175 --> 06:17.342
Let me check.

06:17.609 --> 06:18.944
Ooh, exotic.

06:19.011 --> 06:19.977
(sighs)

06:20.045 --> 06:21.879
Let me see here.

06:21.947 --> 06:23.114
(woman shrieks,
whip cracks over computer)

06:23.682 --> 06:24.782
(man moans)

06:24.849 --> 06:26.383
PAUL:
Jess?

06:26.451 --> 06:27.451
What?

06:27.518 --> 06:29.687
Oh, um...

06:29.754 --> 06:31.221
Sorry, uh...

06:31.289 --> 06:32.556
Can I call you back?

06:32.624 --> 06:34.024
Yeah.

06:34.092 --> 06:36.459
(man and woman moaning,
speaking Spanish)

06:36.526 --> 06:37.460
(key clicks, video stops)

06:37.527 --> 06:39.495
Hey, Schmidt!

06:39.563 --> 06:42.098
Can I borrow your computer?

06:43.266 --> 06:45.134
Nick? Winston?

06:46.971 --> 06:48.270
(key clicks, video resumes)

06:48.338 --> 06:50.006
(man and woman moaning,
speaking Spanish)

06:50.074 --> 06:51.140
(whip cracks)

06:51.208 --> 06:53.541
(chuckles)

06:53.610 --> 06:54.710
What?

06:54.777 --> 06:56.211
(mechanical buzzing)

06:56.278 --> 06:58.313
(woman shrieks, man chuckles)

06:58.380 --> 07:00.348
What?

07:00.416 --> 07:03.318
(man laughs, whip cracks)

07:03.885 --> 07:05.086
Hey, do you have my comput...

07:05.154 --> 07:07.188
Oh, my computer.

07:07.256 --> 07:08.823
- I have your computer.
- I can see that.

07:08.890 --> 07:11.025
Hey, I got to cram
for this baby shower.

07:11.093 --> 07:12.760
Can I, can I have it back?

07:12.828 --> 07:14.795
I've been watching porn.

07:14.863 --> 07:17.064
You...
(chuckles)

07:17.132 --> 07:19.299
I found your red folder.

07:19.367 --> 07:20.901
How-how long you been doing that for?
Are you okay?

07:20.969 --> 07:22.937
Five and a half hours.

07:24.805 --> 07:26.106
(horse neighs)

07:26.173 --> 07:27.974
Wow. Uh, you went deep, Jess.

07:28.042 --> 07:28.975
Real deep.

07:29.043 --> 07:30.110
Help me, guys.

07:30.177 --> 07:31.177
I have 15 minutes.

07:31.245 --> 07:33.446
Teach me how to be good at sex.

07:34.351 --> 07:36.851
I just, I have to
go on this date right now

07:36.919 --> 07:40.188
and I can't do it.
I'm freaking out, okay?

07:40.255 --> 07:42.290
I need all of you
to sit in front of me

07:42.357 --> 07:44.425
and tell me what guys like
in bed, right now.

07:45.092 --> 07:45.893
What do you want to know?

07:45.961 --> 07:46.927
Okay.

07:46.994 --> 07:49.229
Um, when you're...

07:49.297 --> 07:50.697
if you're in the...

07:50.764 --> 07:53.399
if you're holding the...

07:53.467 --> 07:54.467
Start over.

07:54.535 --> 07:56.169
Um...

07:56.237 --> 07:58.071
when you reach...

08:01.242 --> 08:02.375
...completion...

08:02.443 --> 08:03.608
- Yeah, that was it.
- Completion?

08:03.676 --> 08:04.776
- No! No, wait.
- I can't do this, Jess.

08:04.845 --> 08:06.078
Come on. Come back here.

08:06.146 --> 08:08.513
Jess, guys want to
be whisked away.

08:08.581 --> 08:09.715
They want to be enchanted.

08:09.782 --> 08:10.883
Just take your
clothes off, Jess.

08:10.951 --> 08:12.451
Do you think that Paul

08:12.518 --> 08:14.286
watches stuff like that?

08:14.354 --> 08:15.754
- All the time.
- For sure.

08:15.822 --> 08:16.722
Probably watching it right now.

08:16.789 --> 08:17.723
Really? Okay.

08:17.790 --> 08:18.957
I put this on mute,

08:19.024 --> 08:20.124
because this girl's...

08:20.192 --> 08:21.592
like, pretty loud.

08:21.660 --> 08:23.427
And, um, my main thing

08:23.495 --> 08:24.729
that I took away was,

08:24.796 --> 08:26.898
gosh, that young lady can

08:26.966 --> 08:27.999
really multitask.

08:28.067 --> 08:29.167
- Super normal.
- She's a pro.

08:29.235 --> 08:30.168
- What she's doing.
- I don't know

08:30.236 --> 08:31.570
if every girl's like that,
but she's a pro.

08:31.637 --> 08:33.772
Was wondering if there
are any trendy moves.

08:33.839 --> 08:35.173
'Cause I've been
doing the same four

08:35.241 --> 08:38.576
for the last six years, like...

08:39.743 --> 08:41.711
Uh, and you know, like, uh...

08:41.779 --> 08:42.712
(groans)

08:42.780 --> 08:44.081
That one.

08:44.148 --> 08:45.415
And I don't know.

08:45.483 --> 08:47.017
Do you think that Paul would be

08:47.085 --> 08:49.319
into, like,
something like that?

08:49.387 --> 08:50.720
What, a little light choking?

08:50.788 --> 08:52.955
I'm gonna bet Paul is into
some pretty dark stuff.

08:53.023 --> 08:55.091
- Light choking, really?
- No one's doing that.

08:55.158 --> 08:57.093
You know what, Nick, maybe you're
hooking up with the wrong kind of girl.

08:57.160 --> 08:59.061
Apparently, I'm hooking up
with the right girl, Schmidt,

08:59.129 --> 09:00.830
because they don't choke me.

09:00.898 --> 09:02.831
Nick is a meat and potatoes
kind of guy.

09:02.832 --> 09:04.233
- Winston and I...
- Don't want to be a part of this.

09:04.301 --> 09:05.568
- ...we're sushi.
- So you guys really think

09:05.636 --> 09:06.635
you're better at sex than me.

09:06.703 --> 09:07.537
- Yeah.
- Absolutely.

09:07.605 --> 09:09.971
What did you do after you lost your
virginity? What did you say to me?

09:10.039 --> 09:11.639
Don't say that right now.
You're taking it out of context.

09:11.707 --> 09:13.174
He said, "Winston,
is it okay that

09:13.242 --> 09:14.476
I didn't get my pants
all the way off?"

09:14.544 --> 09:15.977
That's a true story.
That really happened.

09:16.045 --> 09:18.213
I was 16 years old.

09:18.281 --> 09:20.115
And I've gotten a lot better.

09:20.182 --> 09:21.950
You haven't gotten that much
better. I used to listen

09:22.018 --> 09:23.784
to you and Caroline
all the time in college.

09:23.851 --> 09:25.452
It was like listening
to a rescue crew

09:25.520 --> 09:28.522
trying to communicate
with a stranded miner.

09:28.589 --> 09:30.757
"Are you okay?"

09:30.825 --> 09:33.760
"Yeah. Are you okay?"

09:33.828 --> 09:34.995
- "Yeah."
- Hey, guys,

09:35.063 --> 09:36.030
I don't have much time.

09:36.097 --> 09:37.264
Can we get this back on track?

09:37.332 --> 09:39.365
I need to know what to do.

09:39.433 --> 09:41.834
Would flicking be,
like, a cool thing?

09:41.902 --> 09:43.169
No.

09:43.237 --> 09:44.304
- No!
- Absolutely not.

09:44.371 --> 09:45.371
How about role play?

09:45.439 --> 09:46.572
Do you know any voices?

09:46.640 --> 09:47.607
Yes. I can do

09:47.675 --> 09:50.176
an old-timey newscaster, like,
"Hey there, son,

09:50.244 --> 09:52.311
I'm gonna kick you
into next Tuesday, see?"

09:52.378 --> 09:54.580
You're telling me,
for the last 15 years, you've been

09:54.648 --> 09:57.015
thinking I'm bad at sex.
I'm fantastic at sex.

09:57.083 --> 09:58.783
Dude, you're scared
to get a haircut.

09:58.851 --> 09:59.952
Yeah, I don't like
getting a haircut!

10:00.019 --> 10:01.554
It's too intimate. What does
that have to do with sex?

10:01.621 --> 10:02.455
Okay, Jess, here's
what you're gonna do.

10:02.522 --> 10:03.990
You got a question,
just come to me because

10:04.058 --> 10:06.859
- I'm obviously the best.
- No, you're not the best.

10:06.927 --> 10:09.562
Jess, who do you think, of the
three of us, is the best at sex?

10:09.629 --> 10:10.613
Yes.

10:10.629 --> 10:11.763
And take emotion out of it.

10:11.831 --> 10:13.965
No one's feelings
are gonna get hurt.

10:14.032 --> 10:15.867
- Go with your gut. - Especially,
you know, Nick and Winston's.

10:15.935 --> 10:17.335
No, I'm not doing this.

10:17.402 --> 10:18.937
- Say a name.
- Go with your gut.

10:19.004 --> 10:20.237
(knock on door)

10:20.305 --> 10:21.439
Oh. Oh!

10:22.007 --> 10:23.040
Hey! Paul!

10:23.108 --> 10:24.808
Hey, Paul.

10:26.578 --> 10:28.111
- Hey.
- PAUL: Hey.

10:29.179 --> 10:30.480
Hey, goose.

10:30.547 --> 10:32.615
Hey, goose.

10:33.683 --> 10:34.784
(chuckles)

10:34.852 --> 10:36.086
JESS: I'm gonna go get
ready in my room.

10:36.153 --> 10:37.321
- Okay.
- I'll be back.

10:37.389 --> 10:39.456
- I'll just hang out with the guys.
- Cool.

10:40.223 --> 10:40.857
Hey, guys.

10:40.924 --> 10:41.625
- What's up?
- What's up?

10:41.693 --> 10:42.825
- What's up, Paul?
- Oh, you're

10:42.893 --> 10:43.826
looking at me like, "what?"

10:43.994 --> 10:45.027
I should tell you.

10:45.096 --> 10:47.863
Um, "Goose" is short for
<i>"me gusta Jess."</i>

10:47.930 --> 10:49.465
- Of course.
- Come here, sit down, man.

people being so careful with me.

11:13.855 --> 11:15.788
It's like, I am 40
and I am pregnant.

11:15.856 --> 11:17.257
I am not made out of crackers.

11:19.293 --> 11:21.694
Hey, ladies
What are you guys talking about?

11:21.762 --> 11:23.630
- Afterbirth.
- Afterbirth.

11:23.697 --> 11:25.165
That's like the,
the party you guys have

11:25.233 --> 11:27.100
after you have the baby...

11:27.201 --> 11:29.403
- Sort of. - You know, I'd like
to be invited to that.

11:29.470 --> 11:31.370
You know what they say,
"An afterbirth ain't an afterbirth

11:31.438 --> 11:32.906
without some Schmidt
up I in there."

11:32.907 --> 11:33.907
Schmidt? Come here.

11:34.408 --> 11:35.707
I'm gonna talk to you
in a little bit.

11:35.808 --> 11:37.143
- What are you doing?
- I'm rocking this party, Beth.

11:37.210 --> 11:38.411
Watch this.

11:42.214 --> 11:44.716
Hi. How's everyboby doing?

11:44.784 --> 11:48.386
You know, I just, I just wanted
to take a moment to, well,

You don't know the
first thing about women.

Ah, you're the best, Beth.
I don't know if you know this

12:09.307 --> 12:12.176
about me, but I was in
two frats in college.

12:12.243 --> 12:13.977
Want to know why?

when my imagination

12:57.285 --> 12:59.286
isn't really working...

12:59.354 --> 13:02.824

- Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah, I'm good, I'm good!

16:49.970 --> 16:51.504
(gasping)
Let me get you some water.

16:51.571 --> 16:53.106
Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna
get some water at home.

16:53.173 --> 16:55.975
- I-I have good water at home.
- No, no, no, I have water here.

16:56.043 --> 16:58.310
I have a filter,
it's a special ionized filter...

16:58.378 --> 16:59.311
I got at home.

17:03.631 --> 17:06.364
Oh, I'm so glad you convinced me
to go to your barbershop.

17:06.432 --> 17:09.566
Wow, man. I...
it actually looks really good.

17:09.634 --> 17:11.702
Right? I look good.

17:11.770 --> 17:14.171
And I loved it in there.
You think they liked me in there?

17:14.239 --> 17:15.539
I think they loved
you in there, man.

17:15.607 --> 17:17.040
NICK:
Okay, good.

17:17.108 --> 17:19.242
- How'd it go?
- Is he still in there, Jess?

17:22.912 --> 17:24.114
No more tea.

17:25.181 --> 17:26.449
I forgot to buy tea.

17:39.494 --> 17:40.862
(softly):
Hello.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.468
Where's...

17:46.535 --> 17:48.102
where's the door?

17:51.206 --> 17:51.907
Hey.

17:51.975 --> 17:55.109
What's up, Jess?

17:55.177 --> 17:57.145
You okay, Jess?

17:57.212 --> 17:58.980
I messed up.

17:59.247 --> 18:01.215
He ran away. He got scared.

18:01.283 --> 18:02.783
Why would he be scared?

18:02.851 --> 18:04.785
Because I choked him.

18:04.853 --> 18:06.954
I lightly choked him.

18:07.022 --> 18:08.522
Wow.

18:08.590 --> 18:10.723
That's what happens
when you listen to Schmidt.

18:10.791 --> 18:12.392
It's just...
when I was with Spencer,

18:12.460 --> 18:14.461
I just didn't even think
about this stuff, you know?

18:14.528 --> 18:17.364
- Just did it.
- Okay.

18:17.431 --> 18:19.299
Here's the thing.

18:19.367 --> 18:21.034
You gotta stop
thinking about it.

18:21.102 --> 18:22.735
Just relax, and be yourself.

18:22.803 --> 18:23.970
You're awesome.

18:24.038 --> 18:25.271
What do you think, Winston?

18:25.339 --> 18:27.306
Why are you asking Winston?

18:27.374 --> 18:29.041
Because, Nick,
look at your hair.

18:29.109 --> 18:30.976
You really don't look like
someone who's good at sex.

18:31.044 --> 18:32.878
I can't believe
you just said that.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.679
Here's what you do. You're
gonna stop worrying about it.

18:34.747 --> 18:37.383
- Completely.
- Yeah. That's really good.

18:37.450 --> 18:38.950
That's literally
what I just said.

18:39.019 --> 18:40.185
What are you worried about,
anyway?

18:40.253 --> 18:42.420
Paul doesn't care what you do.

18:42.488 --> 18:44.222
I've seen the way
that boy looks at you.

18:44.289 --> 18:46.124
And he is crazy about you.

18:46.191 --> 18:47.392
- I agree, I...
- Shh.

18:47.459 --> 18:49.793
I'm trying to listen
to Winston.

18:49.861 --> 18:52.630
(knocking on door)

18:53.697 --> 18:54.665
- Oh, hi!
- Hi.

18:54.733 --> 18:56.467
- Paul.
- Hey, Winston.

18:56.535 --> 18:57.835
Could I talk to you
for a minute?

18:57.903 --> 18:59.703
Yeah.

18:59.771 --> 19:01.939
We'll...
step into my office.

19:02.007 --> 19:03.641
- Okay. Hey, Nick.
- NICK: Okay.

19:06.878 --> 19:09.212
Um...

19:09.280 --> 19:11.415
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:13.184 --> 19:15.919
- So, last night was, um...
- No, I'm so sorry.

19:15.986 --> 19:18.221
- No, no, don't, please...
- Unacceptable.

19:18.289 --> 19:20.723
I'm really intimidated
by you, Jess.

19:20.791 --> 19:23.226
You're so experienced, and I've
never done any of that stuff,

19:23.294 --> 19:26.263
that S and M style...
bondage stuff.

19:26.330 --> 19:28.598
It scares me a little, but I...

19:28.666 --> 19:30.900
want to do it, because I know
that you're into it.

19:30.968 --> 19:34.003
Just please be gentle
with me at first, okay?

19:35.071 --> 19:36.372
I really like you.

19:36.940 --> 19:38.740
Really?

19:38.808 --> 19:40.642
Yeah, I do.

19:40.710 --> 19:42.511
And nothing else matters.

19:42.579 --> 19:43.647
(sighs)

19:43.879 --> 19:45.247
Except, just...

19:45.315 --> 19:48.083
no fire, and no handcuffs, please.
Please, please, please.

19:48.150 --> 19:50.418
Okay? And I'm allergic to felt.

19:50.486 --> 19:52.053
And most polyurethanes.

19:52.821 --> 19:54.755
Okay, well, that's it.

19:57.592 --> 19:59.159
And no bugs, too,
I don't know if that was...

19:59.227 --> 20:00.394
(elevator bell dings) Paul.

20:00.462 --> 20:01.596
Wait. Um...

20:05.000 --> 20:08.335
Last night was kind of a...
low point for me. I mean...

20:09.403 --> 20:12.639
I'm not really into that stuff.
I just... I thought that

20:12.707 --> 20:15.308
whatever I used to do
wouldn't be good enough,

20:15.375 --> 20:17.978
or sexy enough,
or advanced enough,

20:18.045 --> 20:19.746
- and that's why I did that...
- Oh no!

20:19.814 --> 20:21.614
- Sorry. - Oh, no. No, it's okay,
it just surprised me

20:21.615 --> 20:24.884
- a little bit.
- I just...

20:24.952 --> 20:26.218
I like you.

20:29.756 --> 20:32.691
Well, good.

20:32.759 --> 20:34.727
I'll walk you down.

20:34.794 --> 20:36.029
Okay.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.301
Oh! Um, the new trombones
came in...

20:44.369 --> 20:46.638
Paul...

21:07.391 --> 21:10.360
(gasping, kissing)

21:10.427 --> 21:12.996
(emergency stop alarm buzzes)

21:14.064 --> 21:16.064
You know that doesn't speed it up
when you do that.

21:16.132 --> 21:16.999
I know, I know.

21:17.067 --> 21:18.400
(elevator bell dings)

21:20.370 --> 21:21.403
We're about to go see a movie.

21:21.471 --> 21:22.505
You guys want to come?

21:22.573 --> 21:24.407
- Sure.
- Sure.

21:25.475 --> 21:27.677
Hey, Jess?
Is that your shoe?

21:31.814 --> 21:33.615
Boy, your haircut
look like a high-rise.

21:33.683 --> 21:36.351
(laughing)

21:36.419 --> 21:38.420
Where the penthouse at?

21:38.488 --> 21:40.822
Hey, old man, what,
did you steal those pants

21:40.890 --> 21:42.357
off of Danny Glover's
grandfather?

21:42.425 --> 21:44.793
(Nick laughing)

21:47.362 --> 21:51.031
I am Danny Glover's grandfather.

21:51.799 --> 21:52.966
I'm a big fan of his work.

21:53.034 --> 21:54.802
He's great
in the <i>Lethal Weapons.</i>

21:56.369 --> 21:58.305
No, I'm not.
(laughing)
