00:01.630 --> 00:03.440
Hey! Who deleted
last week's episode of <i>Bones?</i>

00:03.565 --> 00:04.588
I heard they kissed.

00:04.754 --> 00:06.844
- Where is it?
- I know!

00:06.969 --> 00:08.592
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

00:09.071 --> 00:10.510
Limited edition lap hog

00:10.676 --> 00:13.555
- X.L. Condom. Who took it?
- Why are you wearing my shirt?

00:13.721 --> 00:17.351
Your what? Your shirt?
I got this at the thrift store.

00:17.517 --> 00:20.145
You got a t-shirt from my middle school
Randomly at a thrift store?

00:20.311 --> 00:21.859
Yeah.
What's the big deal?

00:21.984 --> 00:23.627
You find lots of treasures
at thrift stores.

00:23.752 --> 00:26.463
What are you, a thrift-store professional now?
Where's my condom?

00:26.588 --> 00:27.698
- Hey, guys...
- what are you talking about?

00:27.823 --> 00:29.567
My hair foam's missing.
It's gone.

00:29.692 --> 00:32.269
I know he doesn't need it
'cause he's got a thick head of hair.

00:32.394 --> 00:33.337
- Okay.
- You're like a lion.

00:33.462 --> 00:35.105
But this mane is looking extra thick.

00:35.230 --> 00:37.575
That's bizarre, 'cause
I was thinking last week

00:37.700 --> 00:39.543
Ders is looking
like a bald, old woman.

00:39.668 --> 00:40.845
- Let me smell your hair.
- What are you...

00:40.970 --> 00:42.012
I'm gonna need to smell your hair.

00:42.137 --> 00:43.013
Stop it!
You're not smelling my hair!

00:43.138 --> 00:44.181
Where is it, guys?

00:44.306 --> 00:45.983
This collection means
a lot to me, all right?

00:46.108 --> 00:47.852
That's the shirt I wore

00:47.977 --> 00:49.687
In seventh grade when
I won the indiana jones...

00:49.812 --> 00:51.422
My dad looks exactly
like michael chiklis.

00:51.547 --> 00:53.136
I will not forgive you
if you took it.

00:53.302 --> 00:54.513
Oh, michael chiklis?
Really?

00:54.679 --> 00:57.194
Why would I ever, ever
take hair-care products?

00:57.319 --> 00:58.262
I don't believe you, man!

00:58.387 --> 01:01.923
Well, you are a liar and a thief!

01:03.000 --> 01:09.074

01:20.476 --> 01:22.124
I'm a teenage beer wolf!

01:31.987 --> 01:35.132
- I'm down.
- Beer wolf down!

01:35.257 --> 01:37.264
Who is ready for a night
at the museum of tolerance

01:37.430 --> 01:39.474
Of alcohol?
I am.

01:40.462 --> 01:41.505
Turn that song up!

01:41.630 --> 01:43.478
Turn the beat up.

01:45.634 --> 01:46.677
Guys, no! No.
She's my baby.

01:46.802 --> 01:48.178
Shoot the wiper fluid!
Shoot the wiper fluid!

01:49.671 --> 01:50.948
That's cool.
You see everyone's technique.

01:51.073 --> 01:52.149
Yes, thank you.

01:52.274 --> 01:54.551
Jillian, great idea for a party.
You brought your scalp collection.

01:54.676 --> 01:55.986
No. No, blake.

01:56.111 --> 01:57.755
They're my costumes.
I'm taking an improv class.

01:57.880 --> 01:59.619
I thought this would be
the perfect place

01:59.785 --> 02:02.159
To start auditioning
some of my characters.

02:02.284 --> 02:03.394
I should be an actor.

02:03.519 --> 02:05.262
A lot of people say
I look like matt damon...

02:05.387 --> 02:07.031
's his ugly younger brother,

02:07.156 --> 02:08.866
Philip... just more jowls.

02:08.991 --> 02:09.963
I can see that.

02:10.128 --> 02:11.201
A lot of people don't know about him.

02:11.326 --> 02:12.603
People say I look
like weird al sometimes...

02:12.728 --> 02:13.671
Like, his son.

02:13.796 --> 02:14.797
Oh, wait.
I forgot the beer.

02:15.898 --> 02:17.679
Oh!
Hey, buddy.

02:17.845 --> 02:19.843
Are you looking
for mr. Walker's pool party?

02:19.968 --> 02:21.345
Yeah, we're just going up.

02:21.470 --> 02:23.614
Right. It's gonna be
next door in our community pool.

02:23.739 --> 02:25.182
- Ooh. Interesting.
- Really?

02:25.307 --> 02:27.351
- Oh, he's a trickster.
- Okay.

02:27.476 --> 02:28.552
- He's a trickster.
- Thanks a lot.

02:28.677 --> 02:29.887
Hey, guys,
I need you to behave yourselves,

02:30.012 --> 02:30.888
For real.

02:31.013 --> 02:33.528
Good call.
I'll throw this one away right now.

02:33.694 --> 02:35.693
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

02:35.818 --> 02:37.699
Rock a jock, ten-point shot!

02:37.865 --> 02:38.986
- Get it!
- Hey, oh!

02:40.576 --> 02:42.466
I am sorry about that.

02:42.591 --> 02:43.801
Dan cortese would've made that.

02:43.926 --> 02:45.135
- He would've made that one.
- I hate punks.

02:45.260 --> 02:48.835
Sorry!
We're gonna wear shoes.

02:50.833 --> 02:51.834
Wait a minute.
Come on!

02:55.304 --> 02:56.714
- Ah!
- Got him. Yes!

02:56.839 --> 03:00.514
Okay. Guess who I voted for in 2000.

03:01.310 --> 03:02.953
Bush.

03:03.078 --> 03:04.955
O-oh.
My favorite band?

03:05.080 --> 03:06.853
Pubic enemy.

03:08.684 --> 03:10.482
Gotta tell you, tez,
some spread you got here.

03:12.233 --> 03:13.864
Can I cross a line here
and just ask how

03:13.989 --> 03:15.445
You can afford to live
in a place like this?

03:15.611 --> 03:17.034
If you must know,

03:17.159 --> 03:19.103
Colleen got promoted to principal

03:19.228 --> 03:21.034
At john g. Neihardt elementary.

03:21.964 --> 03:23.007
And it don't hurt that

03:23.132 --> 03:25.372
Alice gave me a two-year
pay bump at work.

03:25.538 --> 03:29.013
What?

03:29.138 --> 03:31.515
Waymond, get out this pool
and take a shower!

03:31.640 --> 03:33.004
How many times I gotta tell you?

03:34.243 --> 03:35.452
Listen, I gotta tell you something.

03:35.577 --> 03:36.687
- It's cold, ders!
- Let me tell you something.

03:36.812 --> 03:37.888
- Can we get some of your food?
- Guys, stop. No!

03:38.013 --> 03:39.010
Let me get a little bite
of your sandwich!

03:39.176 --> 03:40.157
There was whole spread!

03:40.282 --> 03:41.492
You should've gotten some
while it was hot.

03:41.617 --> 03:43.327
No way. Then we'd have to
wait 30 minutes to swim.

03:43.452 --> 03:44.661
And we had to dunk some fools, man.

03:44.786 --> 03:46.430
- I dunked so many fools!
- Did you? I'm sure.

03:46.555 --> 03:48.499
- Waymond almost drowned!
- Yeah, that was cool.

03:48.624 --> 03:50.901
Cool. All right, well, anyway,
I gotta tell you something.

03:51.026 --> 03:54.192
Listen, I guess tez just got a raise.

03:54.358 --> 03:55.485
All right?

03:55.651 --> 03:57.574
Now, alice is over there.
She's real drunk.

03:57.699 --> 03:58.864
We go over there now,

03:59.030 --> 04:01.045
Maybe we can get a raise.
You feel me?

04:01.170 --> 04:02.212
Aw, I feel you so much.

04:02.337 --> 04:03.614
Can I just dip my finger
in the mayonnaise?

04:03.739 --> 04:05.249
Let me just get your pickle.

04:05.374 --> 04:07.718
- Take the pickle.
- Yeah, I got a pickle!

04:07.843 --> 04:09.353
I don't like vegetables, so
that doesn't even matter to me.

04:09.478 --> 04:11.209
Ugh, these are the neon ones.
I hate neon pickles.

04:11.375 --> 04:13.490
Alice!
Heading to pound town, huh?

04:13.615 --> 04:15.714
I didn't know you were
such a party beast.

04:15.880 --> 04:18.262
You should come, like, rage with us

04:18.387 --> 04:20.802
- At our... nah.
- Yep.

04:20.968 --> 04:22.699
Two years of sobriety, gentlemen.

04:22.824 --> 04:24.222
- Good for you!
- Oh!

04:24.388 --> 04:25.569
Two years, gone.

04:25.694 --> 04:26.804
- Oh, it's a bad thing.
- Yeah.

04:26.929 --> 04:28.268
Oh, yeah.
Ugh.

04:28.434 --> 04:31.675
I saw this house
and this awesome neighborhood,

04:31.800 --> 04:34.399
And I was like...
Pbbt! Screw it.

04:34.565 --> 04:36.610
Drink the pain away.
Good call, good call.

04:36.776 --> 04:38.945
Elbow drop
from the top rope, bitches!

04:39.111 --> 04:41.919
Alice, I believe
a woman of your talents

04:42.044 --> 04:44.555
And your ambitions
deserves everything

04:44.680 --> 04:45.856
In your wildest dreams.

04:45.981 --> 04:48.330
What are your wildest dreams, alice?

04:48.496 --> 04:50.461
Tez told me you gave him
a two-year pay bump,

04:50.586 --> 04:52.362
- So I was thinking maybe...
- fine.

04:52.487 --> 04:53.597
- Fine.
- Whoa.

04:53.722 --> 04:54.631
- Cool, really?
- Wow.

04:54.756 --> 04:56.630
- Yep, you got it.
- That was easy.

04:56.796 --> 04:58.715
Gil, can I bum a smoke, babe?

04:58.881 --> 05:01.171
So we'll stop by
in the morning at the office

05:01.296 --> 05:02.719
Just to iron out the details?

05:02.885 --> 05:04.675
Yeah, works for me!

05:04.800 --> 05:06.097
All right.
See you then!

05:06.263 --> 05:07.578
Raises!
All right!

05:07.703 --> 05:08.712
- We got raises!
- Yeah!

05:08.837 --> 05:10.268
That was so easy.
We just got raises.

05:10.434 --> 05:12.312
Let's go smoke weed
about it right now.

05:13.542 --> 05:15.482
If these are montez's garage ties,

05:15.648 --> 05:16.887
The guy is balling.

05:17.012 --> 05:18.652
This one just screams money.

05:18.818 --> 05:20.570
Speaking of garages,

05:20.736 --> 05:22.526
Did you know that the word
actually comes from

05:22.651 --> 05:24.532
The latin meaning "go rage"?

05:24.698 --> 05:26.952
- I did not know that. Wow.
- That's 'cause it doesn't.

05:27.118 --> 05:29.162
- Learned something new.
- Interesting enough...

05:29.328 --> 05:31.869
These rooms were built
by people's houses

05:31.994 --> 05:33.437
So you could, well,
you know, go rage.

05:33.562 --> 05:34.709
You could go there and rage!

05:34.875 --> 05:36.711
We're actually
upholding, like, a very,

05:36.877 --> 05:38.338
Very old tradition.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.882
Uh, dummies, I just snopesed it.

05:41.048 --> 05:42.813
It's not true.
You're lying.

05:42.938 --> 05:44.047
It's real, and it's gonna go

05:44.172 --> 05:45.582
Into my, uh, bathroom publication,

05:45.707 --> 05:49.786
<i>Uncle blazer's fun facts
just to take a poop to.</i>

05:49.911 --> 05:51.059
That's a working title, though.

05:51.225 --> 05:52.894
Look at all these cool-ass toys!

05:53.060 --> 05:54.258
- Oh, my goodness.
- Oh!

05:54.383 --> 05:55.726
Once we get our raises,

05:55.851 --> 05:58.462
We're definitely gonna
have to rob a toys "r" us.

05:58.587 --> 06:00.030
But with, like, our money, though.

06:00.155 --> 06:01.165
- Rob it with our money.
- Oh!

06:01.290 --> 06:02.666
Freeze! Here's a hundred-dollar bill.

06:02.791 --> 06:03.734
I want toys.

06:03.859 --> 06:06.537
- Oh, you want this?
- Yeah.

06:06.662 --> 06:08.493
But toys got weird.

06:08.659 --> 06:11.375
What is this?
What is this?

06:11.500 --> 06:13.010
- Well, that... that is a bug.
- Yeah, that's a...

06:13.135 --> 06:15.212
Well, you know, like...
like, all right, so, like...

06:15.337 --> 06:16.813
No, I know what you're saying.
I know what you're saying.

06:16.938 --> 06:18.649
- Toys are really weird now.
- Toys are getting weird.

06:18.774 --> 06:20.317
They're not made up of anything real.

06:20.442 --> 06:22.048
Like, back in our day, it was like,

06:22.214 --> 06:25.923
Turtles, ninjas, mutant... Teenagers.

06:26.048 --> 06:27.391
Yeah.
Or like a cassette tape

06:27.516 --> 06:30.640
That's also a pterodactyl
or a, uh, puma.

06:30.806 --> 06:32.496
- I believe that toy.
- Yeah.

06:32.621 --> 06:35.020
Or, like, I don't know, like those.

06:35.186 --> 06:38.481
Those are so real.

06:42.359 --> 06:45.905
Gentlemen, this hill was built
for a soap-box-derby car.

06:47.135 --> 06:48.378
Let's two-man dream-team this mug.

06:48.503 --> 06:50.013
- Let me get in there, blake.
- Get on in here.

06:50.138 --> 06:51.181
I like that.

06:51.306 --> 06:53.350
Oh, but all it takes
is a golden ticket.

06:53.475 --> 06:54.851
Yeah, and by ticket, I mean

06:54.976 --> 06:57.421
X.L. Lap hog limited edition condom.

06:57.546 --> 06:58.789
I know one of you dudes took it.

06:58.914 --> 07:00.253
I don't even use condoms.

07:00.419 --> 07:03.193
I was kicked a lot
in the balls as a child,

07:03.318 --> 07:04.461
If you must know.

07:04.586 --> 07:05.796
Yeah, and you stole
my eric draven t-shirt,

07:05.921 --> 07:07.130
- So you owe me.
- All right.

07:07.255 --> 07:09.190
Sorry, boys.
But I'm bombing this jonah hill.

07:12.828 --> 07:13.933
- All right.
- Get 'em!

07:14.099 --> 07:15.872
Whoo!
Go blake!

07:15.997 --> 07:17.441
Picking up speed!
There we go, baby!

07:17.566 --> 07:19.981
I am the human missile crisis!

07:20.147 --> 07:22.067
Dude, I wish I was on that thing!

07:22.233 --> 07:23.651
Oh, damn!

07:23.817 --> 07:25.206
I feel like a coors light!

07:26.975 --> 07:28.352
What the...?

07:28.477 --> 07:29.486
Ah!
The brakes!

07:29.611 --> 07:30.887
- Go right!
- The brakes!

07:31.012 --> 07:32.689
- The brakes!
- Don't go that way!

07:32.814 --> 07:35.092
Stop!

07:35.217 --> 07:36.526
He broke something.

07:36.651 --> 07:38.652
He broke something.

07:47.549 --> 07:49.219
Are you all right?

07:49.385 --> 07:50.854
Goddamn punks.

07:50.979 --> 07:52.847
You're under patrolman's arrest.
Get in the car now!

07:53.014 --> 07:55.549
Uh, actually, officer,
we can explain. Go!

08:25.947 --> 08:28.691
Wait.

08:28.816 --> 08:30.051
Looks like the gate's
the only way out.

08:30.284 --> 08:31.427
Oh!
I got an idea.

08:31.552 --> 08:33.263
We can <i>ernest saves christmas</i>
this situation!

08:33.488 --> 08:35.472
I don't know what you mean, vern.

08:35.690 --> 08:37.691
We hop in the back of the truck,

08:38.142 --> 08:40.794
And we ride it out.

08:48.803 --> 08:51.156
I think we're passing the front gate.

08:51.372 --> 08:53.616
I feel the freedom!

08:53.841 --> 08:54.951
I think we just passed
the old train yard!

08:55.176 --> 08:57.020
You guys smell that?

08:57.145 --> 08:58.588
Honey-baked ham.

08:58.713 --> 09:00.890
We're downwind
from that togo's by our place.

09:01.015 --> 09:02.041
I'm so hungry.

09:04.819 --> 09:06.880
Shib.

09:12.360 --> 09:16.389
Where's the clicker?

09:16.555 --> 09:18.016
It's in the car.

09:18.266 --> 09:19.184
It's locked.

09:19.467 --> 09:21.177
I'm freaking out.

09:21.302 --> 09:23.012
We're in a garage,
and we're not totally raging.

09:23.137 --> 09:24.480
- That is weird.
- Shh!

09:24.605 --> 09:25.882
I found the way out.

09:26.007 --> 09:28.318
You're gonna go in his house?

09:28.443 --> 09:30.119
Guys, wait.
Wipe your feet.

09:30.244 --> 09:31.688
This is somebody's home.

09:31.813 --> 09:33.698
- Hey, let's go through here.
- Let's go through the kitchen!

09:33.981 --> 09:35.617
I'm so hungry.
Just give me a second.

09:36.951 --> 09:38.294
Who's calling you
in the middle of the night?

09:38.419 --> 09:40.163
My sister, cathy.
You know that already.

09:40.288 --> 09:42.398
Really?
It's your sister?

09:42.523 --> 09:43.599
You know what's weird?

09:43.724 --> 09:45.835
Is that every time
that I pick up the phone,

09:45.960 --> 09:47.370
Your sister doesn't wanna talk.

09:47.495 --> 09:51.257
Oh, please. Would you stop
with the paranoia now?

09:51.532 --> 09:53.718
- Oh, my gosh.
- Wow.

09:54.001 --> 09:55.611
No way.
Check it out.

09:55.736 --> 09:56.879
A zz top shirt.

09:57.004 --> 09:58.181
Shh. Why don't you go ahead
and take it?

09:58.306 --> 10:00.350
Save yourself a trip
to the "thrift store."

10:00.475 --> 10:03.228
Ders, could you back up
off my business, okay?

10:03.511 --> 10:04.821
You're right up in my...

10:10.685 --> 10:12.779
You guys here to fuck maria, too?

10:13.054 --> 10:14.297
No, man.
We're just trying to get home.

10:14.422 --> 10:15.365
Wait. Who's maria?

10:15.490 --> 10:18.201
Do you think she'd fuck us?

10:18.326 --> 10:19.902
I've never been enough
for you, have I, maria?

10:20.027 --> 10:22.872
Even though I put your daughter
in a two-bedroom in manhattan!

10:22.997 --> 10:25.708
Oh! You used to
consider her our daughter.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.777
This is why I never
should've married an italian.

10:27.902 --> 10:28.878
- Oh, please.
- Shh!

10:29.003 --> 10:29.879
He can't talk to her like that!

10:31.139 --> 10:32.682
I gotta do it!
No, no. I gotta do this!

10:32.807 --> 10:33.883
You got some nerve,

10:34.008 --> 10:35.318
Talking to an italian woman
that way, cal.

10:35.443 --> 10:36.619
Randall?

10:36.744 --> 10:38.554
You're fucking randall?

10:38.880 --> 10:40.523
Yes, I'm fucking randall.

10:40.648 --> 10:41.524
You know what?

10:41.649 --> 10:43.935
I need more right now, cal.

10:44.218 --> 10:45.770
- Hello.
- Hey.

10:47.054 --> 10:48.197
Four guys, maria?

10:48.322 --> 10:49.866
Is that what you need to satisfy you?

10:49.991 --> 10:51.442
I don't know who these guys are.

10:51.726 --> 10:53.069
So what do you need?

10:53.194 --> 10:54.570
You need me to watch?

10:54.695 --> 10:55.989
You want me to get in there
with those guys,

10:56.264 --> 10:58.116
- You know, get in with it?
- No!

10:58.399 --> 10:59.342
You want me to watch you blow them?

10:59.467 --> 11:00.376
'cause I will do that.

11:00.501 --> 11:02.178
- No!
- You want me to blow them?

11:02.303 --> 11:03.579
I'll do whatever it takes.
I'll blow 'em.

11:03.704 --> 11:05.415
Let's see your dicks.
Come on.

11:05.540 --> 11:06.833
- Uh...
- I'm good. I'm good.

11:07.108 --> 11:08.001
I'm trying to save my marriage!

11:08.276 --> 11:10.186
Now get your dicks out!

11:10.311 --> 11:11.721
Wait. Hey!

11:11.846 --> 11:14.648
- Bring your dicks back here!
- Cal!

11:22.014 --> 11:23.327
{pub}Hey, jillian.

11:23.452 --> 11:24.762
Yeah, we need you to come pick us up.

11:24.887 --> 11:26.097
We are trapped.

11:26.222 --> 11:27.231
Oh!
Have her stop at togo's,

11:27.356 --> 11:30.401
Get me an italian
with extra mayonnaise...

11:30.526 --> 11:34.205
Wow. I'm starving to death,
and no one cares.

11:34.330 --> 11:37.113
Oh, god.
I say we just pound this dude.

11:37.279 --> 11:38.709
I been watching a lot
of bum fights lately.

11:38.834 --> 11:40.950
You kick him in the balls,
I'll stab him with a syringe.

11:41.116 --> 11:42.480
Dude, it is not about
brute strength right now.

11:42.605 --> 11:43.647
He's got the law on his side.

11:43.772 --> 11:45.204
We caused thousands
of dollars of damage.

11:45.370 --> 11:47.118
We're not gonna have raises
because we're gonna be in jail

11:47.243 --> 11:48.666
When we're supposed to
be meeting with alice.

11:48.832 --> 11:51.589
Well, there's only one way
out of here.

11:51.714 --> 11:52.690
- I like that.
- The sewer?

11:52.815 --> 11:55.131
What are you doing? Guys.

11:57.007 --> 11:58.028
Smells like my dad's bathroom.

11:58.153 --> 11:59.802
Ugh, it's like willy wonka

11:59.968 --> 12:02.533
But with poo in the water
instead of chocolate.

12:02.658 --> 12:04.525
Ugh. It kind of does remind me
of willy wonka.

12:07.196 --> 12:08.227
We'll just stay down here

12:08.393 --> 12:10.063
Till the heat dies down, okay?

12:10.229 --> 12:11.976
That was awesome, right?

12:12.101 --> 12:13.344
That naked dude?

12:13.469 --> 12:16.027
Regular ed helms, man.
That guy was packin' heat.

12:16.193 --> 12:17.862
You mean, uh, john holmes.

12:18.028 --> 12:19.950
No, ed helms from <i>the office.</i>

12:20.075 --> 12:21.574
Supposedly he's got, like,
a stellar rig.

12:21.740 --> 12:22.620
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:22.745 --> 12:23.621
Dudes.

12:23.746 --> 12:26.037
We are so ninja turtles right now.

12:26.203 --> 12:27.789
- We kind of are.
- We kind of are.

12:27.955 --> 12:29.393
- Yeah, definitely.
- I'm michelangelo.

12:29.518 --> 12:30.928
Yeah, you definitely
are michelangelo!

12:31.053 --> 12:32.496
- Party, dude.
- Yes.

12:32.621 --> 12:34.337
- I'm raphael. Cool but rude.
- Oh, nailed it.

12:34.503 --> 12:35.797
Yep, definitely rude.

12:35.963 --> 12:37.368
That's a character flaw,
but I'll take it, you know?

12:37.493 --> 12:38.383
How's it look?

12:38.549 --> 12:39.970
- Whoa, how'd you do that?
- Yeah.

12:40.095 --> 12:41.806
Oh, I just chewed it
with my, uh, vampire teeth.

12:41.931 --> 12:42.762
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

12:42.928 --> 12:43.808
Well, let's see.

12:43.933 --> 12:45.576
So we got our nice mike over there.

12:45.701 --> 12:46.977
- We got rude raph.
- Yeah, rude raph.

12:47.102 --> 12:48.059
So I guess, uh,

12:48.225 --> 12:50.915
I'm leonardo, the... L...

12:51.040 --> 12:52.063
Katana dude?

12:52.229 --> 12:53.856
No.
Definitely not.

12:54.022 --> 12:55.419
No, you're not leonardo.

12:55.544 --> 12:56.692
Don't compliment yourself so much.

12:56.858 --> 12:57.693
Nice try, though.

12:57.859 --> 12:58.956
You're definitely donatello.

12:59.081 --> 13:00.530
Oh, he's so donatello!

13:00.696 --> 13:02.031
Oh, you're so donatello.

13:02.197 --> 13:04.128
Donatello's, like, a nerd.

13:04.253 --> 13:06.661
And like, he...
he's like a party pooper.

13:06.827 --> 13:08.132
- Yeah.
- That's basically...

13:08.257 --> 13:09.300
That's 100% who you are.

13:09.425 --> 13:10.873
It's anders-tello.
That's you.

13:11.039 --> 13:12.291
- Oh, yeah. Anders-tello.
- You just described him.

13:12.457 --> 13:13.671
Very good. Plus,
you don't even have a mask.

13:13.796 --> 13:15.002
So how could you be a ninja turtle?

13:15.168 --> 13:16.440
Well, you didn't steal me a mask!

13:16.565 --> 13:18.108
You could've stole
yourself a mask, man.

13:18.233 --> 13:19.924
Whoa. Enter donatello,
the bummer dude.

13:20.090 --> 13:22.479
Just take your little computer
out and play with it, donatello.

13:22.604 --> 13:23.781
- Maybe I will.
- Check out some facts.

13:23.906 --> 13:25.263
Full bagel bite in here.

13:27.443 --> 13:28.891
They're hard to digest, evidently.

13:38.650 --> 13:40.130
I can't be leonardo,

13:40.255 --> 13:42.499
Why don't I just
cover my body in hair

13:42.624 --> 13:44.802
And call myself splinter, huh?
How do you think about that?

13:44.927 --> 13:46.033
- What do you think, huh?
- I knew it!

13:46.199 --> 13:48.405
I've been using it for weeks, buddy.

13:48.530 --> 13:49.707
It feels great.
Smells even better.

13:49.832 --> 13:51.809
I know.
Your hair smells delicious,

13:51.934 --> 13:52.877
And I've noticed that.

13:53.002 --> 13:54.378
And I could tell
that you were using it

13:54.503 --> 13:55.543
- 'cause you have a bald spot.
- No, I don't.

13:55.709 --> 13:56.847
You've seen his bald spot.

13:56.972 --> 13:58.249
I just wanted my hair thicker
and smelling better.

13:58.374 --> 13:59.630
You're bald, just like donatello.

13:59.796 --> 14:01.382
They're all bald.

14:01.548 --> 14:03.120
No, actually,
they all shaved their heads

14:03.245 --> 14:05.136
To support him while
he was fighting cancer.

14:05.302 --> 14:06.290
That's so nice of the other dudes,

14:06.415 --> 14:07.291
Supporting him while he has cancer...

14:07.416 --> 14:08.431
You are gettin' snopesed!

14:08.597 --> 14:10.725
Oh, snopes me, ders!
Please snopes me.

14:10.891 --> 14:12.196
I get no bars in here.

14:12.321 --> 14:14.604
Oh, your machine doesn't work,
does it, donatello?

14:14.770 --> 14:16.564
You really had to steal
from me, huh, bro?

14:16.730 --> 14:17.732
Whatever, man.

14:17.898 --> 14:20.004
You want some of my money?
Is that what you want?

14:20.129 --> 14:21.438
You want some of my money?
There's a dollar.

14:21.563 --> 14:22.445
Here are some rocks.
There's a nickel.

14:22.611 --> 14:23.779
And a limited edition

14:23.945 --> 14:26.710
Lap hog x. L. Condom!

14:26.835 --> 14:28.451
Adam, you burgled me, dude?

14:28.617 --> 14:30.414
- Told you.
- I'm sorry, blake.

14:30.539 --> 14:32.316
You don't need it.
I need it.

14:32.441 --> 14:34.585
God blessed/cursed me
with a thigh-slapper,

14:34.710 --> 14:37.168
And I need an x. L. Condom
to package the whole thing.

14:37.334 --> 14:40.057
Oh, yeah, right.
Come on, man. I've seen it.

14:40.182 --> 14:41.325
- It's not that big.
- No, you're...

14:41.450 --> 14:43.327
I walk in on him
jerkin' off all the time.

14:43.452 --> 14:44.675
It is that big.
Deal with it.

14:44.841 --> 14:47.331
- I've got an ed helms.
- News flash, everybody...

14:47.456 --> 14:49.847
Friends do not steal
from other friends.

14:50.013 --> 14:51.635
That's, like, a basic rule.

14:51.760 --> 14:53.392
I didn't wanna have
to do this, blake.

14:53.558 --> 14:55.770
But take off your pants.

14:55.936 --> 14:57.563
- Ew, no.
- I saw...

14:57.729 --> 14:59.843
When we were chicken fighting,
your underwears.

14:59.968 --> 15:00.945
Take off your pants right now!

15:01.070 --> 15:02.485
- Don't do this.
- Take your pants off.

15:02.651 --> 15:04.946
And don't make me use
my muscles 'cause I'll use 'em.

15:07.406 --> 15:09.116
Yep.
There you go.

15:09.282 --> 15:10.701
My breathable mesh jockeys?

15:10.867 --> 15:12.703
- Yeah. He stole your underwear.
- Dude!

15:12.869 --> 15:14.124
So you're also a thief.

15:14.249 --> 15:16.290
Pot calling the kettle...
Uh...

15:16.456 --> 15:18.376
- Black.
- Black.

15:18.542 --> 15:21.265
Hey, guys.
It's me.

15:21.390 --> 15:22.463
Jill bon jovi.

15:22.629 --> 15:24.268
Livin' on a prayer that you guys

15:24.393 --> 15:27.237
Are still alive and well.

15:27.362 --> 15:29.306
Regardless, you're wanted...

15:29.431 --> 15:30.638
Dead or alive.

15:30.804 --> 15:33.177
But hopefully alive,
'cause that'd be so weird

15:33.302 --> 15:34.517
If you guys were dead.

15:34.683 --> 15:36.680
A t-shirt I understand!

15:36.805 --> 15:38.148
But you're wearing my underwear.

15:38.273 --> 15:40.417
It's not fair!
I don't like doing laundry!

15:40.542 --> 15:42.353
Plus, your stuff smells so good.

15:42.478 --> 15:44.527
You know what else smells so good?

15:44.693 --> 15:45.723
Ders' beautiful hair

15:45.848 --> 15:47.691
Because of my expensive hair foam!

15:47.816 --> 15:48.926
Who cares?

15:49.051 --> 15:51.295
Who wears underwear
under swim trunks, anyway?

15:51.420 --> 15:52.496
Now I know you peed in them.

15:52.621 --> 15:54.537
Oh, yeah.
I peed in them.

15:54.703 --> 15:56.033
I did.
I definitely did.

15:56.158 --> 15:57.301
Oh, my god. That's it.
I'm out of here.

15:57.426 --> 15:58.969
I'm done.
I don't care if I get caught.

15:59.094 --> 16:01.162
Bye.
Bye, bye.

16:04.800 --> 16:05.631
We're locked in here.

16:05.797 --> 16:08.145
Santa, santa, where are you?

16:08.270 --> 16:10.052
It's your little elf, jillian!

16:10.218 --> 16:13.139
Oh, you guys can't see
what I'm wearing.

16:14.743 --> 16:18.122
This line of moss and hair and sticks

16:18.247 --> 16:19.270
Represents my area.

16:19.436 --> 16:21.814
I don't wanna see either
of you two crooks

16:21.980 --> 16:23.983
Coming anywhere near my ledge.
All right?

16:24.149 --> 16:25.596
Like I would even wanna do that.

16:25.721 --> 16:27.664
My area's comfy as [bleep] over here.

16:27.789 --> 16:29.155
If I'm not leonardo,

16:29.321 --> 16:31.032
How come I'm the only one
who hasn't screwed up today?

16:31.198 --> 16:32.269
We got two hours

16:32.394 --> 16:34.805
To get to alice's office
and get our raises.

16:34.930 --> 16:37.307
You know what?
You're not leonardo.

16:37.432 --> 16:38.664
You're a member of the foot clan.

16:38.830 --> 16:41.000
- You are a foot clan member!
- What'd you just say?

16:41.166 --> 16:42.179
You're not just a member.

16:42.304 --> 16:43.580
- You're danny.
- Danny?

16:43.705 --> 16:44.879
You're that punk bitch danny!

16:45.045 --> 16:47.051
Danny?
I'm leonardo!

16:47.176 --> 16:50.645
- No, you're danny.
- Katana strike!

16:52.803 --> 16:54.513
Oh, god! That's poop.
There's poop in that water!

16:54.679 --> 16:55.640
Ah!
We're gonna drown!

16:55.806 --> 16:58.351
- Somebody help us!
- Ah! Help!

17:07.473 --> 17:08.415
I did not think I would die

17:08.540 --> 17:10.863
The exact same way as jimi hendrix.

17:11.029 --> 17:13.324
- This is bad.
- Help!

17:13.490 --> 17:15.823
Blake, I'm so sorry
I stole that condom from you.

17:15.948 --> 17:18.392
It's not because
I have an enormous dick.

17:18.517 --> 17:20.330
It's slightly less than enormous.

17:20.497 --> 17:22.630
It's just s. T.D. S run in my family,

17:22.755 --> 17:24.131
And I just wanted a condom big enough

17:24.256 --> 17:26.000
To cover my dick and my balls.

17:26.125 --> 17:27.755
- I'm so sorry!
- Okay, yes!

17:27.921 --> 17:29.036
Thank you!

17:29.161 --> 17:30.971
And, ders, I'm sorry
that I stole your panties.

17:31.096 --> 17:32.973
It doesn't matter how soft they are,

17:33.098 --> 17:35.471
It's not right for a dude to
steal another dude's drawers.

17:35.637 --> 17:37.278
I'm not innocent.
I stole the hair stuff.

17:37.403 --> 17:39.058
It smelled great.
I just took it.

17:39.224 --> 17:40.347
It smells so good.

17:40.472 --> 17:42.616
- It smells so good.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

17:42.741 --> 17:43.751
Get out of the poop water!

17:43.876 --> 17:45.356
Get up on this ledge.
Come on, come on.

17:45.522 --> 17:47.233
- Is that cool?
- Yes, come on, sweethearts.

17:47.399 --> 17:48.484
- Ugh.
- These are my guys.

17:48.650 --> 17:50.444
Is it weird that I'm
still hungry right now?

17:50.610 --> 17:52.059
Get up here.

17:52.184 --> 17:53.160
We got ya.

17:53.285 --> 17:54.824
- Oh, it's way better up here.
- Yeah.

17:54.990 --> 17:55.863
I don't want you thinking

17:55.988 --> 17:57.865
You're gonna die as donatello, man.

17:57.990 --> 18:00.000
- You are leonardo till death...
- Yes, you are.

18:00.125 --> 18:01.288
- Thank you.
- Which might be soon.

18:01.454 --> 18:03.165
Yes!
There you are.

18:03.331 --> 18:04.238
Totally. Leo!

18:04.363 --> 18:05.406
- You are leo!
- I'm like you guys!

18:05.531 --> 18:06.460
- Yeah.
- You are.

18:06.626 --> 18:07.837
I'm leonardo.
I'm the leader.

18:08.003 --> 18:09.243
Let's get something like leverage.

18:09.368 --> 18:10.840
We need to just, like...
we can pry it.

18:11.006 --> 18:12.379
Oh!
There was that metal bar!

18:12.504 --> 18:14.014
Uh, that's at the bottom
of the river, though.

18:14.139 --> 18:15.316
I don't want anybody
reaching in there

18:15.441 --> 18:16.554
'cause that's how you get aids.

18:16.720 --> 18:19.553
Unless you have one of these...
an aids protector!

18:19.678 --> 18:21.600
- Oh, my god!
- I can prevent aids with this!

18:21.766 --> 18:23.081
Maybe this wasn't meant

18:23.518 --> 18:25.092
To house your total package, demamp.

18:25.217 --> 18:29.221
Maybe it was meant to get
metal things out of poop.

18:29.774 --> 18:30.798
- Yes!
- Yeah, there we go.

18:30.923 --> 18:31.861
- Hold my hair.
- All right.

18:32.027 --> 18:33.000
- Ready?
- Hold me!

18:33.125 --> 18:34.405
I think it was right
over there. There it is!

18:38.364 --> 18:39.740
- Yes!
- I got it! I got it!

18:39.865 --> 18:40.774
Get it in there.
Get it in there.

18:40.899 --> 18:42.455
It dries, and it dries it quickly.

18:42.621 --> 18:44.645
We gotta find, like, a hole
around the circumference.

18:44.770 --> 18:45.713
We could pry it in.

18:45.838 --> 18:46.917
- Yeah...
- or make a hole or something...

18:47.083 --> 18:49.128
Oh, my gosh.
Give me that, uh, hair foam!

18:49.294 --> 18:50.588
- What?
- Yeah.

18:50.754 --> 18:53.153
It's a very little known fact
that stuff is very combustible.

18:53.278 --> 18:54.922
We'll shake it up,
puncture it, light it,

18:55.047 --> 18:56.093
And we might blow this grate.

18:56.259 --> 18:57.678
All right, man, I'm believing you.

18:57.844 --> 18:59.513
- Thanks, man.
- There we go.

18:59.679 --> 19:01.015
All right, here we go.

19:01.181 --> 19:02.129
Here we go, baby.

19:02.254 --> 19:04.143
All right.

19:04.309 --> 19:06.024
Light it, light it!

19:07.493 --> 19:10.571
Is my... is my hair on fire?
Am I cool?

19:10.696 --> 19:11.609
It's good, it's good, it's good.

19:11.775 --> 19:13.464
Turtle power!

19:18.740 --> 19:19.647
Go on.
Go on!

19:19.772 --> 19:20.848
Leonardo, you lead!

19:20.973 --> 19:22.483
I'll go!
Later, guys.

19:22.608 --> 19:23.609
- Get in there.
- Oh, oh.

19:29.648 --> 19:31.916
Hey. Oh!
There's... there's jillian!

19:34.506 --> 19:36.509
She's parked on top
of the manhole cover.

19:36.675 --> 19:38.302
That's the reason we were trapped!

19:38.468 --> 19:40.721
- Jillian! You almost killed us!
- Oh, my god.

19:40.887 --> 19:42.403
But thank you for coming to get us.

19:42.528 --> 19:44.850
We really appreciate it.
Now take us to work really fast.

19:46.935 --> 19:48.896
Hi, can I help you?

19:49.062 --> 19:51.899
Are you serious?

19:52.065 --> 19:53.692
You idiots think you can fool me?

19:53.858 --> 19:56.717
No. No, come on.
Please.

19:56.842 --> 19:59.240
No! Oh, come on.
Why?

20:00.379 --> 20:01.655
Alice, we're here for our raises!

20:01.780 --> 20:03.657
- We're here! We made it.
- Whoo!

20:03.782 --> 20:05.359
- Raises?
- All right. Perfect.

20:05.484 --> 20:07.498
Why do you guys smell like shit?

20:07.664 --> 20:09.530
- Um...
- we're here for our raises

20:09.655 --> 20:12.066
Because you said
you'd give us one at the party

20:12.191 --> 20:14.380
- When you were flirting with me.
- Uh-oh!

20:14.546 --> 20:15.402
Listen to me.

20:15.527 --> 20:16.904
There is no money

20:17.029 --> 20:19.426
In the budget for me
to give you raises.

20:19.592 --> 20:21.554
Okay?
But...

20:21.720 --> 20:24.348
If you must have something,

20:24.514 --> 20:27.281
I can give you this.

20:27.406 --> 20:28.352
We had a client send us too many.

20:28.518 --> 20:30.017
Oh, no way.
A mini-vac!

20:30.142 --> 20:31.522
Wow, cool.
Thank you so much!

20:31.688 --> 20:32.731
- That's cool.
- I've always wanted one.

20:32.897 --> 20:33.654
- Those are expensive.
- I'll take it.

20:33.779 --> 20:34.722
- Can I see?
- Just relax.

20:34.847 --> 20:35.723
Well, this is for me.
What's for him?

20:35.848 --> 20:37.069
- Relax.
- Okay.

20:37.235 --> 20:38.659
- It's all of ours, okay?
- Don't be an idiot.

20:38.784 --> 20:40.155
No, it's me.
This is mine, right?

20:40.321 --> 20:43.200
Shh!
Ah, shut your mouths.

20:43.366 --> 20:44.898
- She gave it to me! It's mine.
- Would you let me see it?

20:45.023 --> 20:46.667
You're never gonna use it!
Shut the hell up, you idiot.

20:46.792 --> 20:48.035
I have the dirtiest room, anyway.

20:48.160 --> 20:49.403
You don't even know what...

20:49.528 --> 20:52.029
What are you even talking
about? You're so stupid.

20:54.166 --> 20:57.923
Mmm.
