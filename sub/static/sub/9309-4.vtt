WEBVTT

00:10.788 --> 00:13.890
- It smells like feet in here.
- And whose fault is that?

00:13.924 --> 00:15.358
Whose fault is your face?

00:15.392 --> 00:16.726
Enough, you two...

00:18.262 --> 00:20.363
We should've left an hour ago.

00:20.397 --> 00:22.565
- Why do we have to go to grandma's?
- Theo, you love grandma.

00:22.600 --> 00:24.501
No, he loves Ashley Hammil.

00:24.535 --> 00:26.836
- Good luck with that, B.T. Dubs.
- Shut up, fart knocker.

00:26.871 --> 00:28.905
Nice! Classy.

00:28.939 --> 00:31.875
Tell me, Theo, what exactly is
a fart knocker?

00:31.909 --> 00:34.444
Kids!

00:34.478 --> 00:35.678
No! I wanna know.

00:35.713 --> 00:37.280
Is that how you're gonna
impress Ashley...

00:37.314 --> 00:38.515
- Oh.
- with your extensive knowledge...

00:38.549 --> 00:39.783
- Shut up!
- of fart-related insults?

00:39.817 --> 00:42.385
- Stop talking!
- Rachel, knock it off!

00:42.419 --> 00:44.988
Should I fart-knock it off, Dad?
because according to theo,

00:44.989 --> 00:45.655
- a fart-knocker...
- Gary...

00:45.689 --> 00:47.390
Both of you, stop it!

00:47.424 --> 00:48.591
You're gonna embarrass me
at your grandmother's

00:48.626 --> 00:50.360
- with all your bickering.
- Gary!

<i>Don't look!
No! Oh!</i>

01:08.529 --> 01:11.197
Mmm! Chicken!

01:11.232 --> 01:14.634
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

01:19.740 --> 01:22.509
It's rude to take other people's
food without asking.

01:22.543 --> 01:27.914
It's not rude when
the other people is your mother.

01:27.948 --> 01:30.817
- Morning.
- Morning.

01:30.851 --> 01:34.287
- What do you have there?
- Breakfast.

01:34.321 --> 01:36.856
I do have eggs, English muffins.

01:36.891 --> 01:38.858
Maura...

01:38.893 --> 01:40.593
A respectable fried chicken Sammy

01:40.628 --> 01:43.329
- is not made on an English muffin.
- True.

01:43.364 --> 01:46.130
Thank you for understanding
the importance of correct

01:46.165 --> 01:48.702
sandwich making protocol.

01:48.736 --> 01:50.437
Ma, where'd you get
the fried chicken?

01:50.471 --> 01:52.205
A friend made it.

01:52.239 --> 01:55.742
- What friend?
- A new friend.

01:55.776 --> 01:58.411
A man friend?

01:58.446 --> 02:00.880
- Can't I drink my coffee in peace?
- Nope.

02:00.915 --> 02:02.449
Why do you have to know
everything?

02:02.483 --> 02:03.883
Why do you have
a secret chicken friend?

02:06.620 --> 02:11.691
- Her name is Joann.
- Joann.

02:11.726 --> 02:15.628
Joann the...
personal trainer?

02:15.663 --> 02:19.399
- Hairdresser? Personal shopper?
- Waxing specialist?

02:19.433 --> 02:21.868
Joann is the daughter
of the man I've been dating.

02:21.902 --> 02:26.573
She had us over for dinner,
and she made fried chicken.

02:26.607 --> 02:29.442
- Did you know about this?
- Nope.

02:29.477 --> 02:31.811
Well, now you know.
Happy?

02:31.846 --> 02:33.947
Yes, I am happy.
What's with the secrecy?

02:33.981 --> 02:37.484
Janie, I love you,
but you are so nosey.

02:37.518 --> 02:40.320
Mmm. True.

02:40.354 --> 02:42.622
Sorry.
I was thinking out loud.

02:42.656 --> 02:46.493
- Not helping.
- No.

02:46.527 --> 02:48.294
It's my personal life,

02:48.329 --> 02:51.598
- and I don't want any interference.
- Ma, that is ridiculous.

02:51.632 --> 02:55.235
Why would I want to
interfere with you and...

02:55.269 --> 02:56.870
Morty?

02:56.904 --> 02:58.404
Wrong.

02:58.439 --> 03:00.840
Robert?

03:00.875 --> 03:02.909
- James.
- Bernard?

03:02.943 --> 03:04.878
Leopold?
It's not Leopold, is it?

03:04.912 --> 03:07.380
What, nothing? No name?
W-What am I gonna call him?

03:07.414 --> 03:10.916
You're not. That's the point.

03:12.386 --> 03:15.989
- I wonder if I should have her followed.
- Well, you already seem like

03:16.023 --> 03:18.458
you're about to place that
chicken leg under arrest.

03:18.492 --> 03:21.027
It's an accessory.

03:24.832 --> 03:27.500
- Rizzoli.
- Isles.

<b>6x04 - "Imitation Game"</b>

03:52.459 --> 03:54.360
<i>You have no idea who he is?</i>

03:54.395 --> 03:57.630
None. He never came by
the house. He never called.

03:57.665 --> 03:59.599
It's odd, given how serious it is.

03:59.633 --> 04:02.335
Well, we don't know that it's serious.

04:02.369 --> 04:04.804
Fried chicken is hardly a promise ring.

04:04.839 --> 04:09.809
Yes, but it does indicate fowl play.
"Fowl."

04:09.844 --> 04:11.544
- I got it.
- Okay.

04:11.579 --> 04:13.313
Well, how come his
daughter gets to meet Ma,

04:13.347 --> 04:14.814
and I don't even get to know his name?

04:14.849 --> 04:17.784
Mm, daughter's probably not as...

04:17.817 --> 04:21.754
- busy as you are.
- You know what?

04:21.789 --> 04:24.424
Just, if he sends flowers
or comes by or something,

04:24.458 --> 04:26.993
will you please let me know?
You want me to snoop.

04:27.027 --> 04:28.494
No, I would like for you

04:28.529 --> 04:31.965
to use your impeccable
attention to detail.

04:31.999 --> 04:34.434
Look, this guy could be a creep.
He could have a record.

04:34.468 --> 04:36.569
We don't know.
She could end up abducted.

04:36.604 --> 04:38.271
- She could end up ...
- Stuffed in a fridge,

04:38.272 --> 04:39.105
headed for the city dump.

04:39.139 --> 04:42.475
- Exactly.
- No I.D. Not in the pockets if what,

04:42.476 --> 04:46.379
- if I may say, is a very nice suit.
- Hmm. Italian.

04:46.413 --> 04:49.916
- Armani?
- Not quite.

04:49.950 --> 04:51.584
But did you know

04:51.619 --> 04:53.353
that Giorgio Armani attended
two years of medical school?

04:53.387 --> 04:56.489
- No kidding.
- Yeah, he was interested in the human form.

04:56.523 --> 04:59.359
It probably helped his
design skills considerably.

04:59.393 --> 05:01.694
His menswear is very body-conscious.

05:01.729 --> 05:03.997
Hey, fashion police, what happened?

05:04.031 --> 05:05.965
Oh, truck stopped short.
He fell out of the fridge.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.035
- Did you talk to the driver?
- Yeah. He works for waste management.

05:09.069 --> 05:11.771
Picks up bulk items.
The fridge was on his regular route.

05:11.805 --> 05:14.007
C.S.R.U. is headed for
the exact location now.

05:14.041 --> 05:16.876
- How long has he been dead?
- About 24 hours.

05:16.911 --> 05:20.446
Close range, looks like.
Professional?

05:20.481 --> 05:22.849
Seems a little sloppy
to be left in a fridge.

05:22.883 --> 05:25.585
Maybe it was temporary.
Killer was coming back.

05:25.619 --> 05:27.487
Yeah, and somebody
picked up his leftovers.

05:27.521 --> 05:28.955
You see, people?

05:28.989 --> 05:31.523
This is why we always
leave our names on things.

05:38.599 --> 05:39.999
I'm searching missing persons

05:40.034 --> 05:41.401
for anyone matching the
victim's description.

05:41.435 --> 05:42.802
So far, nothing.

05:42.836 --> 05:44.570
All right, see if any
security or traffic cameras

05:44.605 --> 05:46.139
- caught the drop-off.
- Okay.

05:46.173 --> 05:49.142
All right.
That was your mother.

05:49.176 --> 05:51.911
The plumbing problem at the
Dirty Robber keeps getting worse.

05:51.946 --> 05:55.481
- You get anything on the driver?
- Ricardo Ruiz. No record.

05:55.516 --> 05:57.583
Says he made the pickup
yesterday at 9:00 A.M.

05:57.618 --> 05:59.585
Let's talk to shop
owners and dog walkers,

05:59.620 --> 06:02.088
anybody who might've seen
somebody drop off a fridge

06:02.122 --> 06:03.957
- before the pickup time.
- You got it.

06:03.991 --> 06:06.893
Hey, you know,
you got some vacation days

06:06.894 --> 06:09.923
- that are about to expire.
- So?

06:09.958 --> 06:10.930
Well, you don't get paid
more if you don't take 'em.

06:10.965 --> 06:13.032
Yeah, I know. But what am
I gonna do with a day off?

06:13.067 --> 06:14.567
Well, I need somebody to
look at that plumbing problem

06:14.601 --> 06:17.737
- at the Dirty Robber.
- Me?

06:17.771 --> 06:19.505
Well, your mother said
that you spent your summers

06:19.540 --> 06:22.008
handing your dad wrenches under
every countertop on the block.

06:22.042 --> 06:23.810
Yeah?

06:23.844 --> 06:26.112
She suggested you take a
vacation day and go fix it.

06:26.146 --> 06:28.915
- Did she now?
- It's not me.

06:28.949 --> 06:30.583
It's your mother.
You know how she is.

06:30.617 --> 06:33.352
Oh, believe me, I do.

06:41.228 --> 06:42.795
Did you find something?

06:42.830 --> 06:45.465
Just a single gunshot
wound. .38 caliber.

06:45.499 --> 06:47.667
There was no blood
spatter inside the fridge,

06:47.701 --> 06:49.802
which could mean that
he was shot elsewhere.

06:49.837 --> 06:52.038
Meaning we have no idea where.

06:52.072 --> 06:55.174
There's also something else.

06:55.209 --> 06:57.110
There's someone here.

06:57.144 --> 07:01.914
- Who is it?
- Someone from another agency.

07:01.949 --> 07:05.184
Okay, Maura, I've already played
the guessing game once today.

07:05.219 --> 07:09.789
It rhymes with...
"Left me shy."

07:09.823 --> 07:12.892
Okay, nothing really rhymes with F.B.I.

07:12.926 --> 07:14.093
- F.B.I.?
- Yes.

07:14.128 --> 07:16.202
That is who's here. Now.

07:16.917 --> 07:19.766
Wha...

07:19.800 --> 07:22.201
What rhymes with "pain in my ass"?

07:23.271 --> 07:25.238
<i>Rhetorical.</i>

07:32.689 --> 07:35.825
- Jane Rizzoli.
- Nate Burns.

07:35.859 --> 07:38.294
I see you got a body in a fridge.

07:38.328 --> 07:40.730
I see you're reading our files.
May I ask who called you here?

07:40.764 --> 07:44.033
<i>Technically, it was me.</i>

07:44.067 --> 07:47.703
Well, when Dr. Isles ran your
victim's prints, it alerted us.

07:47.738 --> 07:49.839
The victim's on an
international criminal database,

07:49.873 --> 07:52.408
so we've been after him for a while.

07:52.442 --> 07:54.977
- Great. What can you tell us?
- Name's Yuri Yevtushok,

07:55.012 --> 07:57.713
though he has a lot of aliases.

07:57.748 --> 07:59.482
I would, too.
What do you want him for?

07:59.516 --> 08:04.086
- I'm not at liberty.
- Of course you're not.

08:04.121 --> 08:06.889
But you will want access to
all the evidence and information

08:06.923 --> 08:10.059
that we uncover in our
homicide investigation, correct?

08:10.093 --> 08:12.762
Oh, yeah. That'd be great.
Thank you.

08:12.796 --> 08:14.530
I believe the saying is,
"I'll show you mine

08:14.564 --> 08:18.000
if you tell me what the hell
you're doing in my house."

08:18.035 --> 08:20.336
Well, all right.

08:20.370 --> 08:21.637
But you first.

08:23.874 --> 08:26.930
What have you got, Dr. Isles?

08:29.646 --> 08:32.048
There were a few cotton
fibers on the victim's jacket.

08:32.082 --> 08:33.849
The fibers are dense, heavy grade.

08:33.884 --> 08:36.686
- Like from a rope?
- The lab is running tests now.

08:36.720 --> 08:38.577
I'd like a copy of those results.

08:40.557 --> 08:43.693
Before I could run
prints, I had to remove a

08:43.693 --> 08:46.829
polymeric film coating on
the victim's fingertips.

08:46.863 --> 08:48.431
Initial tests show that
there was a presence

08:48.465 --> 08:51.967
- of a commercial antiseptic.
- Liquid band-aids?

08:52.002 --> 08:54.904
Must mean he was trying
to hide his fingerprints.

08:54.938 --> 08:58.374
- Cat burglar?
- Eh, something like that.

08:58.408 --> 09:00.543
Our victim may be European,
based on the implants

09:00.577 --> 09:02.611
and the gold inlay crowns in his teeth.

09:02.646 --> 09:05.515
It's a common dental practice overseas.

09:07.951 --> 09:11.954
Czech-born.
We think.

09:11.988 --> 09:13.923
Last known address outside of Milan.

09:13.957 --> 09:17.593
Terrific. So we all have
the exact same information,

09:17.627 --> 09:20.663
gathered in the least efficient
way possible. Excuse me.

09:20.697 --> 09:26.135
<i>Cat burglar doesn't
begin to describe this guy.</i>

09:26.169 --> 09:27.770
Yevtushok's a notorious thief,

09:27.804 --> 09:30.439
on every most wanted list
from London to Shanghai.

09:30.474 --> 09:32.908
- So if he was in town...
- It was to steal something.

09:32.943 --> 09:34.744
What we know about this guy is that

09:34.778 --> 09:37.046
he doesn't pick up a phone
for less than $10 million.

09:37.080 --> 09:41.183
So whatever he came for,
it's something big.

09:41.218 --> 09:45.121
- Now was that so hard?
- You're welcome.

09:51.495 --> 09:54.630
- He used the word "notorious"?
- Yeah, like we're in a western.

09:54.664 --> 09:57.433
Nina's trying to pinpoint
exactly when he got into the country.

09:57.467 --> 09:59.902
What about known associates
or previous arrests?

09:59.936 --> 10:01.704
Anybody who might help us figure
out what he was doing here?

10:01.738 --> 10:05.107
We're on it. The F.B.I.'s fairly
certain it's theft-related.

10:05.142 --> 10:06.842
Theft of what, exactly?

10:06.877 --> 10:08.711
Well, that's the problem!
They don't know.

10:08.745 --> 10:10.846
Or if they do know,
they're not telling us.

10:10.881 --> 10:13.582
Well, if it was theft, maybe
he got caught in the act.

10:13.617 --> 10:15.985
Robbery victim kills the thief,
panics, dumps the body.

10:16.019 --> 10:18.454
Here, according to the uniforms.

10:18.488 --> 10:20.823
Here?

10:20.857 --> 10:23.859
- The driver said he picked the fridge up here?
- That's what he said.

10:23.894 --> 10:25.928
So far, nobody saw a refrigerator here

10:25.962 --> 10:27.863
before the time he claims
to have picked it up.

10:27.898 --> 10:29.698
The dumbest criminal I know
would pick a better spot

10:29.733 --> 10:32.635
- to dump a body.
- Driver's lying.

10:34.404 --> 10:36.439
Where did you really
get the fridge, Ricky?

10:36.473 --> 10:39.475
- I don't wanna lose my job.
- Your job?

10:39.510 --> 10:42.345
You lied to a police officer.
That's a crime.

10:42.379 --> 10:43.713
So is obstructing a
murder investigation.

10:43.747 --> 10:45.481
You want a job?

10:45.516 --> 10:48.514
How does underwear detail at
a prison laundry sound, huh?

10:49.703 --> 10:51.537
Sometimes I pick up stuff
that's not on my route.

10:51.572 --> 10:54.440
- On company time?
- We're not supposed to do it.

10:54.474 --> 10:56.442
But people throw away valuables, man.

10:56.476 --> 10:58.744
Like last week, I found a deep fryer.

10:58.779 --> 11:01.614
- You know, for, like, turkeys.
- Where did you get the fridge, Ricky?

11:01.648 --> 11:04.784
Behind a warehouse on Franklin.

11:04.818 --> 11:06.452
I didn't know it had a body in it!

11:06.486 --> 11:07.987
You didn't notice the extra weight

11:08.021 --> 11:09.689
- when you put it on the truck?
- I use a ramp and a dolly.

11:09.723 --> 11:13.059
I was just thinking about the
$150 I was gonna get for it.

11:13.093 --> 11:17.630
- Franklin and what?
- Redding.

11:20.500 --> 11:23.135
So can I get the fridge back?

11:31.845 --> 11:34.747
Here you go.

11:34.781 --> 11:38.484
- All right, what's the verdict?
- Call a plumber.

11:38.518 --> 11:41.821
- Come on, can't you fix it?
- Ma, the pipes behind those walls

11:41.822 --> 11:44.824
are like an M.C. Escher painting.
Even dad couldn't untangle that mess.

11:44.858 --> 11:47.026
Well, who do you think
tangled it in the first place?

11:47.060 --> 11:49.996
- Yeah, I know he worked on the plumbing.
- You were there.

11:50.030 --> 11:53.099
Listen, I can't spend Korsak's money

11:53.133 --> 11:57.403
to clean up a mess that
your father left behind.

11:57.437 --> 12:00.106
Korsak's not gonna mind.

12:00.140 --> 12:02.742
Listen.
Rizzoli men screwed it up.

12:02.776 --> 12:05.934
A Rizzoli man's gonna fix it.

12:15.088 --> 12:18.658
Yes. Now see?
This is where you dump a body.

12:18.692 --> 12:19.959
Amazing what a guy
will say when threatened

12:19.993 --> 12:21.961
with scrubbing other
men's tighty whiteys.

12:21.995 --> 12:25.064
- These were at the crime scene.
- What are they?

12:25.098 --> 12:27.900
Upholstery tacks.
Used in carpet, furniture...

12:27.934 --> 12:30.102
- and art canvases.
- Well, art seems right.

12:30.137 --> 12:33.406
I doubt the F.B.I. would be
sniffing around for carpet theft.

12:33.440 --> 12:36.642
C.S.R.U. recovered paint flecks.
Lab has them now.

12:36.677 --> 12:38.544
Canvas tacks. Paint samples.
Notorious thief.

12:38.578 --> 12:40.846
You'd think our victim
stole a valuable work of art.

12:40.881 --> 12:42.648
And yet, nothing's been stolen.

12:42.683 --> 12:45.051
Or nothing's been
reported stolen, anyway.

12:45.085 --> 12:48.120
Mm-hmm.
Okay, I'm gonna go check with Maura

12:48.155 --> 12:49.955
and see what she found
on the paint samples.

12:49.990 --> 12:53.993
- If any $10 million paintings go missing...
- You'll be my first call.

12:57.530 --> 12:58.998
Hi.

12:59.032 --> 13:02.468
Okay, we're thinking this murder
is connected to art theft.

13:02.502 --> 13:04.070
That would explain the gesso.

13:04.104 --> 13:05.905
- The what now?
- A primer.

13:05.939 --> 13:08.474
Artists use it to help
paint adhere to canvas.

13:08.508 --> 13:09.909
There were traces of it

13:09.943 --> 13:11.610
on the fibers I found
on the victim's jacket.

13:11.645 --> 13:14.947
So these primer-coated fibers
came from an art canvas?

13:14.981 --> 13:17.366
- It's possible.
- So what, he just rolled it up under

13:17.367 --> 13:19.452
- his arm and walked out?
- Also possible.

13:19.486 --> 13:21.721
Okay, how many museums in the area

13:21.755 --> 13:24.523
have paintings that are
worth $10 million or more?

13:24.558 --> 13:27.860
Oh. Several.
Uh, M.F.A., uh, the Peabody,

13:27.894 --> 13:30.830
- Isabella Stewart Gardner, of course.
- And the Gardner's been hit before.

13:30.864 --> 13:33.099
Famously so.
Rembrandt, Vermeer, Degas.

13:33.133 --> 13:37.603
- I believe that 13 paintings were taken.
- And they were never recovered.

13:37.637 --> 13:39.972
- All right, maybe we start there.
- Wait, maybe not.

13:40.006 --> 13:42.808
I went over the jacket
to look for cotton fibers,

13:42.843 --> 13:46.145
and instead, I found
this adhesive residue.

13:46.179 --> 13:48.981
It's in a symmetrical oblong shape.

13:49.015 --> 13:51.617
- Sound familiar?
- Not even a little.

13:51.651 --> 13:53.152
Well, it would had you
taken me up on my offer

13:53.186 --> 13:55.855
to go see that photography
exhibit I told you about.

13:55.889 --> 13:58.898
What, the 20th century
crime scene photos?

13:58.933 --> 14:01.527
- I ought you were kidding!
- No! It was an amazing exhibit.

14:01.561 --> 14:04.029
<i>And it was held... here.</i>

14:05.632 --> 14:06.932
The Boston Museum of Art.

14:06.967 --> 14:10.035
Visitors received a lapel sticker
in this exact shape.

14:10.070 --> 14:11.904
Though I often put mine on my skirt

14:11.938 --> 14:13.706
because the adhesive
can damage finer fabrics,

14:13.740 --> 14:15.541
like the linen in the victim's suit.

14:15.575 --> 14:18.611
Okay. Well, I think that's
the least of his problems.

14:18.645 --> 14:19.912
You're sure about this?

14:19.946 --> 14:21.213
Well, I can send a
lab tech to the museum

14:21.248 --> 14:24.116
to get a sticker for comparison,
but I'm fairly sure.

14:24.151 --> 14:27.820
- So he cased the place.
- Like a regular visitor.

14:27.854 --> 14:29.522
Then he went back in and stole

14:29.523 --> 14:31.190
something valuable enough to kill him.

14:31.224 --> 14:33.259
If the Boston Museum of
Art had been robbed...

14:33.293 --> 14:37.497
Why didn't anyone call the police?

14:45.744 --> 14:48.012
Here, here, here. Right here.

14:50.682 --> 14:52.550
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

14:52.584 --> 14:55.286
Museum director, please.

14:55.320 --> 14:57.221
- He's over there.
- Thank you.

14:57.256 --> 14:59.690
Mr. Mullins?

14:59.725 --> 15:03.027
- You're the museum art director?
- I am.

15:03.062 --> 15:06.431
And judging by the
capricious waving of badges,

15:06.465 --> 15:09.333
I assume you're Detectives
Rizzoli and Korsak.

15:09.368 --> 15:12.103
As I told you on the phone,
there is nothing missing.

15:12.137 --> 15:13.638
Well, we have reason to
believe that a valuable painting

15:13.672 --> 15:15.373
- has been stolen.
- Not from here.

15:15.407 --> 15:18.109
The theft could be linked
to an investigation ...

15:18.143 --> 15:20.044
There has been no theft.

15:20.079 --> 15:23.047
Now if you'll excuse me, I
have a benefit to prepare for.

15:23.082 --> 15:26.350
You must have thousands
of paintings in storage.

15:26.385 --> 15:28.219
Are you absolutely sure
they're all accounted for?

15:28.253 --> 15:30.621
- Yes.
- Okay.

15:30.656 --> 15:33.257
Would you mind if we took a
look at your security system?

15:33.292 --> 15:34.659
Yes, I would mind.

15:34.693 --> 15:36.627
Mm, what about your
surveillance footage?

15:36.662 --> 15:38.229
You would have to subpoena that.

15:38.263 --> 15:40.398
How about we just take a look around?

15:40.432 --> 15:44.535
- No, you won't.
- Is there a problem?

15:44.570 --> 15:48.473
In the art world, the mere
rumor of an investigation

15:48.507 --> 15:50.408
can jeopardize the
reputation of any museum,

15:50.442 --> 15:52.610
even one as established as this.

15:52.644 --> 15:55.680
- How's that?
- Over half our collection is on loan.

15:55.714 --> 15:58.483
Detectives make people nervous,

15:58.517 --> 16:01.486
enough to reclaim their
works or halt their donations.

16:01.520 --> 16:04.449
And on the eve of our biggest
annual benefit? I'm sorry.

16:04.484 --> 16:06.757
If you wanna come in,
you're gonna need a warrant.

16:06.792 --> 16:08.659
We're investigating a homicide here.

16:08.694 --> 16:10.428
I know you're not trying
to stand in our way.

16:10.462 --> 16:12.263
No, not at all.

16:12.297 --> 16:15.099
But unless you think one of
my paintings murdered someone,

16:15.134 --> 16:18.769
this conversation is over.
Detectives.

16:22.141 --> 16:24.041
Remind me to halt my donations

16:24.076 --> 16:28.112
- to this establishment immediately.
- Forthwith and henceforth.

16:31.817 --> 16:34.519
<i>Dale Mullins. No priors,</i>

16:34.553 --> 16:38.089
unless you count being
an uncooperative dick.

16:38.123 --> 16:39.490
We think he's in on it?

16:39.525 --> 16:41.559
He had access to a lot
of very valuable art.

16:41.593 --> 16:43.628
He could've paid Yevtushok
to boost the painting.

16:43.662 --> 16:46.330
He could have a Da Vinci
under his bed for all we know.

16:46.365 --> 16:48.466
Financials for the
curator and the museum.

16:48.500 --> 16:50.134
They're both doing fine.

16:50.169 --> 16:52.503
No major debt expect for
the curator's student loans.

16:52.538 --> 16:55.740
To pay for what I'm
sure are useless degrees.

16:55.774 --> 16:59.127
- Doesn't seem like a killer.
- No, he doesn't, but I would

16:59.128 --> 17:02.580
just like to think that he is
for a little bit longer.

17:02.614 --> 17:04.781
<i>Thanks.</i>

17:04.816 --> 17:07.084
<i>Hey, gang.</i>

17:07.118 --> 17:08.386
Ah, so what are we thinking here?

17:08.420 --> 17:10.488
Art heist gone bad?
Curator in on it?

17:10.521 --> 17:14.325
- We're working several angles.
- Great. Can I help?

17:14.358 --> 17:19.597
- Why start now?
- You really underestimate me.

17:19.631 --> 17:21.799
No, you underestimate me.

17:21.833 --> 17:23.367
Now if you don't want to
be collaborative on this,

17:23.402 --> 17:26.103
that's fine.
You take your ball and you go home.

17:26.137 --> 17:27.571
We're gonna solve this case

17:27.606 --> 17:30.308
with a little thing that
I like to call police work.

17:30.342 --> 17:32.510
Mm. Okay.
So I guess you don't want

17:32.544 --> 17:34.679
the surveillance maps of the museum?

17:34.713 --> 17:38.282
Dots signify cameras.
Security's not great in general.

17:38.317 --> 17:40.851
It's weakest in the storage
areas and the large galleries.

17:40.886 --> 17:42.520
How'd you get this?

17:42.554 --> 17:44.655
Well, I heard that you
were at the museum today,

17:44.690 --> 17:46.824
so I thought
you might find it useful.

17:46.858 --> 17:50.394
- So now you're following me?
- I'm aware of your movements.

17:50.429 --> 17:52.330
No, that's not creepy at all.

17:52.364 --> 17:54.565
And once again, you're welcome.

17:56.168 --> 17:59.370
We spoke to the private security
company that runs the place.

17:59.404 --> 18:00.871
They say their systems are functional

18:00.906 --> 18:02.540
and nothing unusual has been reported.

18:02.574 --> 18:04.408
So I don't know why you
were at the museum today,

18:04.443 --> 18:08.913
but by all accounts,
there's been no crime there.

18:08.947 --> 18:11.749
He's right.

18:11.783 --> 18:14.485
Which means we're not
gonna get a warrant.

18:14.519 --> 18:17.154
So a notorious thief
walks into a museum...

18:17.189 --> 18:20.446
- Sounds like the setup for a joke.
- Or a riddle.

18:20.481 --> 18:22.491
If he didn't steal
anything, why's he dead?

18:31.603 --> 18:33.304
So?

18:33.338 --> 18:35.439
Are you asking whether or not
I fixed those pipes in there?

18:35.474 --> 18:38.643
- I'm asking, did you fix the pipes?
- Well, the answer is "no."

18:38.677 --> 18:40.478
Frankie!

18:40.512 --> 18:42.513
Because what I have done goes
beyond just repairing plumbing.

18:42.547 --> 18:44.715
What I have repaired, Ma, is the past.

18:44.750 --> 18:46.584
I have righted the wrongs of my father.

18:46.618 --> 18:50.354
I have redeemed the Rizzoli name.

18:50.389 --> 18:52.623
Thank you, sweetheart.

18:52.658 --> 18:54.225
- Mwah! Thank you.
- You're welcome.

18:54.259 --> 18:55.693
And I'm gonna put a
plaque in the bathroom

18:55.727 --> 18:57.295
that's got your name on it.

18:57.329 --> 18:59.330
- That's okay.
- No, I want to.

18:59.364 --> 19:02.266
Better not, Ma.

19:02.301 --> 19:06.404
- Hey, uh... how's William doing?
- Who?

19:06.438 --> 19:08.339
Your new boyfriend. William.

19:08.373 --> 19:10.175
That ... That's what you
said his name is, right?

19:10.318 --> 19:15.148
- Nice try, Frankie.
- You know, Jane's not gonna let it go.

19:15.182 --> 19:16.649
You should throw her a bone.

19:16.684 --> 19:19.252
- What?!
- Uh-oh.

19:19.286 --> 19:21.654
- What? 
- Oh!

19:21.689 --> 19:24.657
<i>Oh, my god!</i>

19:28.796 --> 19:30.096
Give me something!

19:30.131 --> 19:33.399
No! Just get me towels!
Towels! Ugh!

19:42.076 --> 19:46.579
- Hi. You got something?
- Lab analysis.

19:46.614 --> 19:49.816
The samples we tested
are from new paint.

19:49.850 --> 19:51.685
- What? So modern art?
- Newer.

19:51.719 --> 19:54.354
Compounds used to make
pigments are specific to

19:54.355 --> 19:56.990
certain periods. A chemical
analysis clearly shows us

19:57.024 --> 19:58.692
what periods that paint came from.

19:58.726 --> 20:00.060
And the paint that we tested,

20:00.094 --> 20:02.495
you would find on
a shelf right now today.

20:02.530 --> 20:04.798
So he stole something painted
in the last couple years.

20:04.832 --> 20:06.466
Well, not much in the
Boston Museum of Art

20:06.500 --> 20:07.867
falls in that category,

20:07.902 --> 20:10.537
and none of it is valued
upwards of $10 million.

20:12.039 --> 20:15.608
Maybe the new paint didn't
come off of something he stole.

20:15.643 --> 20:19.012
Maura, how would you steal a painting

20:19.046 --> 20:22.549
from a world-renowned museum
without somebody noticing?

20:22.583 --> 20:23.783
I'd take it from storage.

20:23.818 --> 20:26.753
Yeah.
Or you'd replace it with a fake.

20:26.787 --> 20:29.889
- Security cameras?
- The museum's security is spotty.

20:29.924 --> 20:31.958
They got blind spots in every
gallery. A pro could do it.

20:31.993 --> 20:34.627
Plausible.

20:34.662 --> 20:38.264
But how would we find
a fake in a museum?

20:38.299 --> 20:40.734
Well, all the paint samples that we did

20:40.768 --> 20:45.071
are varying shades of blue.
Cobalt blue, to be exact.

20:45.106 --> 20:47.874
And that pigment emerged in 1802.

20:47.908 --> 20:49.809
- Gained instant popularity ...
- Maura.

20:49.844 --> 20:51.544
Well, I would just look for paintings

20:51.579 --> 20:54.614
- that had a lot of blue in them.
- Then what?

20:54.648 --> 20:56.583
Then there would be tests,
comparative analysis.

20:56.617 --> 20:58.184
If I go to the museum,
I would be able ...

20:58.219 --> 21:00.720
the curator's surly enough
without us accusing him

21:00.755 --> 21:05.258
- of hanging forgeries on his walls.
- Well, what about Agent Burns?

21:05.292 --> 21:07.627
Maybe they would respond
better to a Feder...

21:07.661 --> 21:10.797
Federal bureaucrat who's
hoarding information

21:10.831 --> 21:13.800
and spying on my investigation?
No.

21:13.834 --> 21:15.368
Well, they can't turn away

21:15.369 --> 21:18.705
a friend of the museum,
can they?

21:44.816 --> 21:47.651
Oh, thank you.

21:47.685 --> 21:49.519
Okay.

21:49.554 --> 21:52.389
Finding the fake painting is
the key to solving this murder.

21:52.423 --> 21:54.925
All right? We just gotta find
it before Mullins finds us.

21:54.959 --> 21:57.828
19th century. Got it.

21:57.862 --> 22:01.097
Lots of blue. Got it.

22:11.568 --> 22:15.704
- Mm-hmm.
- I love the Hudson River School.

22:15.739 --> 22:18.140
You see the roots in
European romanticism,

22:18.174 --> 22:19.675
and yet, it's so distinct.

22:19.709 --> 22:23.245
- The optimism, the grandeur.
- The fakeness?

22:24.714 --> 22:26.115
Right.

22:30.053 --> 22:33.255
Detective Rizzoli and Dr. Isles.
What a surprise.

22:33.289 --> 22:37.459
- Uh-huh. Nice tux.
- Oh. You like it?

22:37.494 --> 22:39.161
What I would like is for
you to stop following me.

22:39.195 --> 22:40.763
Oh, what do you mean?

22:40.797 --> 22:42.731
- I'm a sustaining member of this museum.
- Since when?

22:42.766 --> 22:45.267
This morning, the first
time you followed me here?

22:49.172 --> 22:51.173
- We're not done.
- Mm-hmm.

22:52.409 --> 22:55.544
- Hey, Ma. What's up?
- Janie, I've been thinking.

22:55.578 --> 22:58.680
You have every right to
wanna meet my new boyfriend.

22:58.715 --> 23:00.783
Great. Okay, um, um...

23:00.817 --> 23:03.051
Thank you. I'm ...
I'm glad you came around.

23:03.086 --> 23:04.553
So why don't you join us for dinner?

23:04.587 --> 23:07.122
I have a reservation in 20 minutes.

23:07.157 --> 23:09.591
I-I can't.
I'm working this museum thing.

23:09.626 --> 23:12.461
Oh, is that tonight
the museum thing?

23:12.495 --> 23:15.697
All right, well, another time.

23:15.732 --> 23:17.399
Okay, you know what?

23:17.434 --> 23:18.834
You're only inviting me
because you know I can't come.

23:18.868 --> 23:21.670
That is deceptive, mother.
And underhanded.

23:21.704 --> 23:24.740
And, uh, what is it
you're doing tonight?

23:24.774 --> 23:27.810
Well, I'm pretending that
we're wealthy patrons who ...

23:27.844 --> 23:29.778
It's totally different, Ma!

23:29.813 --> 23:33.178
<i>Yeah. Janie, keep telling
yourself that. Love you!</i>

23:34.584 --> 23:39.288
- Cocktail?
- Thank you.

23:39.322 --> 23:43.030
<i>Jane! I found something.</i>

23:48.631 --> 23:50.199
Thomas Moran.

23:50.233 --> 23:52.634
"Tantallon Castle,
North Berwick, Scotland."

23:52.669 --> 23:57.272
Well, it certainly is blue.
Okay, why this one?

23:57.307 --> 23:59.771
The brush strokes ... they seem halted.

23:59.806 --> 24:01.355
Less musical than his other work.

24:01.390 --> 24:03.412
It's a subtle yet
discernible discrepancy.

24:03.446 --> 24:06.114
Also, I don't like the way
the canvas fits into the frame.

24:06.149 --> 24:09.284
- It's a little flabby.
- Flabby?

24:09.319 --> 24:11.320
Well, canvas stretching
is an art unto itself.

24:11.354 --> 24:12.754
It should be exact.

24:12.789 --> 24:16.892
Well, maybe the museum had it reframed.
They just did a bad job.

24:16.926 --> 24:19.895
Possible, but I believe
someone framing real work

24:19.929 --> 24:22.164
of this caliber would be
more precise.

24:22.198 --> 24:24.166
Is there any way to prove this theory?

24:24.200 --> 24:27.336
Short of sampling the paint, no.

24:27.370 --> 24:29.905
I knew an art historian in Madrid.

24:29.939 --> 24:31.540
I could e-mail him.
I'm sure he'd agree

24:31.574 --> 24:33.902
that this does not align
with Moran's other work.

24:34.744 --> 24:36.178
<i>Damn it.</i>

24:36.212 --> 24:37.546
Okay, how sure are you?

24:37.580 --> 24:41.149
- What?
- That this is the fake. Scale, 1 to 10.

24:41.184 --> 24:43.852
It's impossible to put this on a scale.

24:43.887 --> 24:48.156
- Maura! Better than 8?
- Probably.

24:48.191 --> 24:51.460
Okay.
Um...

24:55.532 --> 24:56.732
Would you
get me another one, please?

24:56.766 --> 24:58.667
Please, I'm so thirsty.

25:04.307 --> 25:07.676
- Take that for you, ma'am?
- Thank you.

25:07.710 --> 25:10.646
- I got it.
- Got what?

25:10.680 --> 25:13.515
- I got it.
- The paint sample?

25:13.550 --> 25:16.518
- How did you...
- Oh, with this.

25:16.553 --> 25:20.222
- No!
- Well, I hope you're right.

25:20.256 --> 25:24.469
Otherwise, I just defaced a
$10 million painting. Come on.

25:25.461 --> 25:26.862
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

25:26.896 --> 25:30.332
No, no. And we're leaving.
And we're leaving...

25:30.366 --> 25:32.968
<i>Nope! We are not looking!
We are leaving.</i>

25:43.413 --> 25:44.780
<i>Nina: Somebody call for a wet vac?</i>

25:44.814 --> 25:48.450
- Hey! Thanks for coming.
- This is not supposed to leave the lab,

25:48.484 --> 25:49.818
but you said this was an emergency.

25:49.852 --> 25:51.987
We thought maybe it
was for a crime scene.

25:52.021 --> 25:53.889
Oh, it's a crime, all right.

25:53.923 --> 25:55.757
My dad charged 1,500 bucks for
this job the first time around.

25:55.792 --> 25:57.659
What is he talking about?

25:57.694 --> 26:00.462
I'm talking about the
plumbing choices my father made

26:00.496 --> 26:02.764
that have left me questioning
my entire childhood.

26:02.799 --> 26:05.734
- Still confused.
- So am I, Susie. So am I.

26:05.768 --> 26:08.704
Is there anything we can do to help?

26:08.738 --> 26:12.240
I don't know.
Got a time machine?

26:12.275 --> 26:14.910
Go back in time and urge my mother

26:14.911 --> 26:17.546
to rethink her choice of husband?

26:24.654 --> 26:26.521
- Ahem.
- Uh, you guys don't have to stay.

26:26.556 --> 26:29.391
I mean, I'll return this later.
I'm sure you have to get back.

26:29.425 --> 26:32.294
Oh, I think Kent can
manage the lab for a while.

26:32.328 --> 26:35.664
And I can make time, in
case you need any help.

26:35.698 --> 26:36.965
All right.

26:51.547 --> 26:53.682
I ran a comparison
of both paint samples.

26:53.716 --> 26:56.518
The first from the scene
where the body was dumped...

26:56.552 --> 27:02.924
and the second, um...
from the fuse-tea-room.

27:02.959 --> 27:04.559
Nothing rhymes with "museum."

27:04.594 --> 27:06.828
How did you get a paint
sample from the museum?

27:06.863 --> 27:09.731
Uh...

27:09.766 --> 27:12.467
well, I-I was ... I was
meaning to tell you that.

27:12.502 --> 27:15.570
Uh, Maura...
mm, Maura...

27:15.605 --> 27:19.474
um, was at a benefit
at the museum.

27:19.509 --> 27:22.611
- To which she was invited.
- And you were...

27:22.645 --> 27:24.312
And I was her guest.

27:24.347 --> 27:26.314
- You know, there...
- Mm-hmm.

27:26.349 --> 27:30.852
to like the art.
So you can imagine, um,

27:30.887 --> 27:33.422
how shocked we were

27:33.456 --> 27:36.358
when we happened across, uh,

27:36.392 --> 27:39.394
a painting that,
in her expert opinion,

27:39.429 --> 27:41.563
Maura felt was, uh, a forgery.

27:41.597 --> 27:43.565
- No, a possible ...
- Shut up.

27:43.599 --> 27:46.935
And how did you get a sample
of this "possible forgery?"

27:46.969 --> 27:51.506
Well... uh...
it was very dramatic, actually.

27:51.541 --> 27:56.335
- I-I stumbled...
- Stumbled?

27:56.479 --> 27:59.481
And, uh, when I was
regaining my balance,

27:59.515 --> 28:03.585
I-I scraped...

28:03.619 --> 28:07.889
- Scraped?
- I grazed the...

28:07.924 --> 28:12.661
- painting in question ever so gently.
- The results are definitive.

28:12.695 --> 28:15.363
- Vandalism?
- Wha... No! I would never.

28:15.398 --> 28:18.700
- Maura, tell him.
- They're an exact match.

28:18.735 --> 28:22.404
Both samples are from current
contemporary compounds.

28:22.438 --> 28:24.556
So the Moran was painted with materials

28:24.557 --> 28:26.675
that didn't exist in the 19th century.

28:26.709 --> 28:29.377
- Yeah, it's fake.
- Conclusively.

28:29.412 --> 28:31.646
But wait a minute.
Then where's the real painting?

28:31.681 --> 28:33.048
More to the point, where is the killer

28:33.082 --> 28:36.386
that murdered our art thief to get it?

28:53.538 --> 28:56.673
Detectives, if I can
assist in the recovery

28:56.708 --> 28:58.675
of the authentic Moran ...

28:58.710 --> 29:00.644
Security in this museum
is a little subpar,

29:00.678 --> 29:03.647
- don't you think, Mullins?
- Is that why you didn't cooperate?

29:03.681 --> 29:04.915
You didn't want us to see
how obsolete your system was?

29:04.949 --> 29:07.551
- I wouldn't say obsolete.
- Oh, please.

29:07.585 --> 29:09.219
The cameras themselves
should be on display.

29:09.253 --> 29:11.254
And while you were
worrying about your precious

29:11.255 --> 29:13.256
donors finding out, a thief
figured it out instead.

29:13.291 --> 29:15.759
And now you have a painting
that's worth about as much

29:15.760 --> 29:18.228
as a velvet Elvis, as opposed
to millions of dollars.

29:18.262 --> 29:21.531
20.
The...

29:21.566 --> 29:24.267
Moran ...
it was worth $20 million.

29:24.302 --> 29:27.594
The placard says it's on
loan from an anonymous donor.

29:27.629 --> 29:29.172
- That's right.
- Who is it?

29:29.207 --> 29:32.463
I have the information on file.

29:32.744 --> 29:35.358
I-I'll go get it.

29:36.581 --> 29:39.182
"This work has been temporarily
removed from display."

29:39.217 --> 29:40.984
This work has been temporarily removed

29:41.019 --> 29:45.288
because this museum sucks.

29:48.593 --> 29:51.895
- Who is this guy again?
- Sam Langdon.

29:51.929 --> 29:53.897
Secretary of public safety.

29:53.931 --> 29:56.867
Since when do state employees
own $20 million paintings?

29:56.901 --> 29:59.169
The painting is mine, actually.

29:59.203 --> 30:02.820
- Mrs. Langdon.
- Mary Hope. Please, come in.

30:04.709 --> 30:06.143
Hello.

30:06.177 --> 30:08.845
Uh, Sam, my husband, couldn't
join us, unfortunately,

30:08.880 --> 30:11.882
but I can tell you anything you
need to know about the painting.

30:11.916 --> 30:15.218
The Moran has been in our
family for generations.

30:15.253 --> 30:18.755
Please.
It used to hang in my father's study.

30:18.790 --> 30:21.725
- Thank you for your cooperation.
- I can't begin to put

30:21.726 --> 30:24.661
a price on how much
this painting means to me.

30:24.695 --> 30:27.831
If it had such sentimental value,
why hang it in a museum?

30:27.865 --> 30:29.633
My husband and I felt selfish,

30:29.667 --> 30:32.602
keeping something so beautiful
where only we could see it.

30:32.637 --> 30:34.204
You're a major patron
of the Metropolitan.

30:34.238 --> 30:36.906
Why loan the painting to
the Boston Museum instead?

30:37.775 --> 30:39.109
They were having a fund-raiser,

30:39.143 --> 30:40.777
and my husband thought
unveiling the piece

30:40.812 --> 30:43.180
might help publicize the event.

30:43.214 --> 30:46.817
I, of course, just liked the idea
of keeping it closer to home.

30:46.851 --> 30:51.621
- But you donated it anonymously.
- I did. I work for a lot of charities,

30:51.656 --> 30:53.957
and I prefer to do my work
outside the public eye.

30:53.991 --> 30:55.625
And neither of us

30:55.660 --> 30:56.927
wanted our phone to start
ringing off the hook.

30:56.961 --> 30:59.963
Art brokers can be... very persistent.

30:59.997 --> 31:02.065
- You've had offers to buy?
- Yes.

31:02.100 --> 31:04.101
And I've always said the same thing ...

31:04.135 --> 31:07.606
the Moran is not for sale,
and it never will be.

31:07.640 --> 31:09.975
Anyone have any trouble with
taking "no" for an answer?

31:10.009 --> 31:13.044
Well, one collector
kept upping his offer.

31:13.079 --> 31:17.015
It got ridiculous.
He went to $40 million.

31:17.049 --> 31:18.750
We'll need to talk to him.

31:18.784 --> 31:22.917
Okay. I'll get you his name.

31:31.897 --> 31:35.300
- Thanks for calling.
- My team is running down the art buyer

31:35.334 --> 31:36.935
who made repeated offers on the Moran.

31:36.969 --> 31:38.703
Maura says she's got something,

31:38.738 --> 31:43.775
- and I could really use your help.
- Now... was that so hard?

31:52.985 --> 31:56.988
- The anatomy of a fake painting.
- Actually, two paintings.

31:57.022 --> 32:01.459
The x-Ray revealed a second painting
underneath the forged image.

32:01.493 --> 32:03.995
And the bottom painting is authentic.

32:04.029 --> 32:06.130
- Like a hundred years old?
- More like 150.

32:06.165 --> 32:07.599
That's pretty common.

32:07.633 --> 32:09.367
An older canvas makes
the work seem authentic.

32:09.401 --> 32:10.869
Easier to pass off.

32:10.903 --> 32:14.339
- So this guy knew his stuff.
- They usually do.

32:14.373 --> 32:15.540
Listen, forgers are
extremely skilled painters,

32:15.574 --> 32:18.509
but for some reason can't break
through with their original work.

32:18.544 --> 32:20.612
Maybe the forger's
behind this whole thing.

32:20.646 --> 32:22.614
Uh, fake the painting
and kill the thief?

32:22.648 --> 32:24.482
Well, he sells the
original on the black market

32:24.516 --> 32:26.584
and moves to an island,
paints sunsets all day.

32:26.619 --> 32:30.154
Or it's the wealthy collector
who wants what he can't have.

32:30.189 --> 32:33.024
Hired the forger and
Yevtushok to lift the original.

32:33.058 --> 32:35.026
All right, well, I'll
have Nina look into it.

32:35.060 --> 32:36.394
There can't be that many people
our there that are this good.

32:36.428 --> 32:38.639
I already checked the
FBI art crimes database.

32:38.674 --> 32:42.400
- Nobody popped.
- You have an art crimes database?

32:42.434 --> 32:44.502
What?

32:44.536 --> 32:47.238
- We didn't get a hit.
- You could've told me that.

32:47.273 --> 32:50.208
I also have a schnauzer named Flearoy.

32:50.242 --> 32:52.043
Does it help our case
for you to know that?

32:52.077 --> 32:54.579
Nobody cares about your schnauzer.

32:56.348 --> 32:58.549
Flearoy?

33:05.357 --> 33:07.692
You wanted to see me?
I'm trying to track down

33:07.726 --> 33:09.260
the artist who painted
the original painting.

33:09.295 --> 33:10.962
If we figure out where
the painting came from,

33:10.996 --> 33:13.398
we might be able to find
out who had access to it.

33:13.432 --> 33:14.999
- The forger.
- Right.

33:15.034 --> 33:18.336
The original artist's initials are
pretty faded on the x-Ray image.

33:18.370 --> 33:20.538
Right now all I know is
the last name starts with "S."

33:20.572 --> 33:23.554
- That's not much.
- You're the only art school graduate

33:23.573 --> 33:25.826
- in the building. Any ideas?
- Well, the lab

33:25.827 --> 33:28.079
found cadmium yellow
in the under-painting.

33:28.113 --> 33:29.580
That pigment wasn't really widely used

33:29.615 --> 33:32.116
- until after 1840 or so.
- Okay.

33:32.151 --> 33:33.518
And the frame that the
canvas was stretched on

33:33.552 --> 33:35.286
is made of American white oak,

33:35.321 --> 33:39.090
which grows most predominantly
in... well, America.

33:39.124 --> 33:43.127
American.
1840.

33:43.162 --> 33:45.029
Last name "S."

33:48.233 --> 33:51.869
This might just be the art
school talking, but in my

33:51.870 --> 33:55.506
opinion, the artist is very
heavily influenced by Thomas Cole.

33:55.541 --> 33:57.742
A lot of the painters
of that period were.

33:57.776 --> 34:00.762
But if this guy was a protégé
of Cole's, he might have

34:00.763 --> 34:03.748
studied at the National Academy,
which Cole founded.

34:03.782 --> 34:06.417
It's worth a shot.

34:08.387 --> 34:10.154
William Louis Sonntag, Sr.

34:10.188 --> 34:13.458
National Academy, 1849 to 1851.

34:13.492 --> 34:15.059
Think that's him?

34:15.094 --> 34:17.061
If it is, his work
would be worth something.

34:17.096 --> 34:18.463
Can you search for works of his

34:18.496 --> 34:22.500
in collections around the country?

34:24.203 --> 34:25.636
There's one at
the Museum of American art

34:25.670 --> 34:27.271
in Bennington, Vermont.

34:27.306 --> 34:29.107
"Duck hunters on the Ohio river."

34:29.141 --> 34:31.208
That's it!
I don't see any ducks.

34:31.243 --> 34:34.245
Museum records say it was
acquired at auction in 2003.

34:34.279 --> 34:38.716
Never went on display,
so it's been in storage ever since.

34:38.751 --> 34:41.418
So whoever took it knew
the museum wouldn't miss it.

34:41.453 --> 34:45.123
Until now.
Nice work, Chang.

34:51.597 --> 34:53.197
Detectives.

34:53.232 --> 34:55.099
We found the art lover
you were looking for.

34:55.134 --> 34:56.634
The one who kept
offering to buy the Moran?

34:56.668 --> 34:59.804
He's a tech billionaire.
F.B.I. stopped his plane at o'Hare.

34:59.838 --> 35:01.506
He was on his way to Copenhagen.

35:01.540 --> 35:03.241
He happen to
have a painting on board?

35:03.275 --> 35:04.542
No, we searched everywhere.
Either he doesn't have it...

35:04.576 --> 35:06.110
Or he's already unloaded it.

35:06.145 --> 35:08.246
So only way to know that
is to find the forger.

35:08.280 --> 35:09.814
These are all the employees

35:09.848 --> 35:11.582
who would've had access to
the painting at Bennington.

35:11.617 --> 35:13.718
Auction house reps, archivists,
couple of researchers.

35:13.752 --> 35:16.054
We're looking at all
of 'em, but this guy...

35:16.088 --> 35:19.190
- didn't show up for work yesterday.
- Charlie Ganz.

35:19.224 --> 35:20.391
Used to do restoration
work at Bennington.

35:20.426 --> 35:23.261
Now he's an adjunct art professor
at a Community College.

35:23.295 --> 35:27.198
Frustrated artist relegated to teaching
'cause nobody buys his stuff.

35:27.232 --> 35:28.833
Yeah, the only art he can
sell are forged master works.

35:28.867 --> 35:30.768
I bet you 20 million bucks
this guy killed our thief,

35:30.803 --> 35:33.271
or he can lead us to who did.

35:33.305 --> 35:35.473
Listen, in case I don't
get a chance to tell you...

35:35.507 --> 35:37.108
You're welcome?

36:01.834 --> 36:04.102
<i>Charlie Ganz?</i>

36:11.810 --> 36:14.545
<i>Clear!</i>

36:14.580 --> 36:17.615
- Clear!
- Something's burnin'...

36:17.649 --> 36:19.283
<i>I'm going up!</i>

36:28.560 --> 36:30.928
That looks like the
wire from our painting.

36:34.900 --> 36:39.236
Somebody just had a $20 million bonfire.

36:48.967 --> 36:50.801
Who burns a $20 million painting?

36:50.836 --> 36:53.170
Yeah, he wanted to destroy any
evidence of his involvement.

36:53.205 --> 36:54.438
He's probably trying

36:54.473 --> 36:56.006
to find a way out of
the country right now.

36:56.211 --> 36:57.545
<i>With documents I bet
he knows how to fake.</i>

36:57.579 --> 36:59.580
- All that money.
- It's front page news now,

36:59.614 --> 37:02.316
which means Charlie Ganz knows
we know about the forgery,

37:02.350 --> 37:04.285
and we've been asking about
him at the Bennington Museum.

37:04.319 --> 37:05.653
And it's a lot harder to sell a painting

37:05.687 --> 37:07.555
the whole world knows is missing.

37:07.589 --> 37:09.056
- Yeah, and if we catch him with it...
- Yeah, painter's hands

37:09.090 --> 37:11.025
aren't exactly an
asset in federal prison.

37:11.059 --> 37:12.660
He kills a guy to get
his hands on the thing,

37:12.694 --> 37:15.095
And then he torches it as soon
as he knows we're on to him.

37:15.130 --> 37:16.497
Why would he do that?

37:16.531 --> 37:17.898
We'll ask him all about
it when we run him down.

37:17.933 --> 37:19.333
Interpol knows he's on the lam.

37:19.367 --> 37:22.269
I don't think he got that far.
His car was seen at the harbor marina.

37:22.304 --> 37:25.506
- I found a slip rented in his name.
- What, he's gonna sail away?

37:25.540 --> 37:27.207
Get this address to Jane,
have her meet us there.

37:28.643 --> 37:31.357
$20 million.

37:35.350 --> 37:38.586
- Slip 7.
- Boat's still here.

37:38.620 --> 37:40.487
<i>Boats and guns is a bad combo.</i>

37:40.822 --> 37:43.557
Charlie Ganz?!
Boston police!

37:43.592 --> 37:46.089
Come out with your hands on your head!

37:58.607 --> 38:02.376
- Damn it.
- It's a suicide.

38:02.410 --> 38:06.213
- .38.
- Just like our dead thief.

38:06.247 --> 38:07.648
He knew we were on to him.

38:07.682 --> 38:09.450
If he wasn't going to
federal prison for art theft,

38:09.484 --> 38:13.721
- he was gonna do life for murder.
- Wha... suicide's better?

38:13.755 --> 38:15.689
Well, I guess you could say he...

38:15.724 --> 38:18.421
painted himself into a corner.

38:20.161 --> 38:25.232
- I'll call it in.
- You know, I feel sorry for the guy.

38:25.266 --> 38:28.002
- What?! Why?
- Well, he's a forger, right?

38:28.036 --> 38:30.104
Nothing he did was original.

38:30.138 --> 38:32.306
Even this is just
a bad Van Gogh rip-off.

38:32.340 --> 38:35.259
I don't think
Van Gogh had a .38 Special.

38:35.294 --> 38:36.176
Just for the record,

38:36.211 --> 38:38.518
I like it when we end
the investigations,

38:38.580 --> 38:40.519
not the bad guys.

39:04.439 --> 39:06.774
Ladies and gentlemen,
the bathroom is fixed.

39:06.808 --> 39:08.475
<i>Whoo!</i>

39:08.510 --> 39:11.378
To my brilliant son ...

39:11.413 --> 39:14.181
twice the plumber his father was.

39:14.215 --> 39:16.450
- Cheers.
- Mmm.

39:16.484 --> 39:18.552
All right, so how'd you do it?

39:18.586 --> 39:24.458
What? I had a lot of help.
Ma, Nina, Susie.

39:24.492 --> 39:26.260
No, no, seriously. Like, where...
where was the problem?

39:26.294 --> 39:29.530
The gasket? Gate diverter?
Diffuser?

39:29.564 --> 39:31.298
Oh, this and that.

39:31.332 --> 39:33.067
How much you pay for your wye
fittings? About 30 a piece?

39:33.101 --> 39:34.702
About that, yeah.

39:34.736 --> 39:37.498
Last I checked, they
were a couple bucks a pop.

39:37.533 --> 39:41.273
Jane, what's with the third degree?
He fixed it, didn't he?

39:41.308 --> 39:45.079
Did he?

39:49.651 --> 39:52.052
<i>"Speed n' Easy Plumbing Services."</i>

39:52.087 --> 39:53.554
You called a plumber?

39:53.588 --> 39:55.189
Ma, the pressure was too much.

39:55.223 --> 39:57.691
Literally, the pipes
were about to burst.

39:57.726 --> 39:59.126
It was my last resort.

39:59.160 --> 40:01.495
I happen to agree with
Frankie's decision.

40:01.529 --> 40:03.263
- You do?
- Yes.

40:03.298 --> 40:05.299
You simply employed the
principle of Occam's razor.

40:05.333 --> 40:07.058
- I did?
- Yes.

40:07.060 --> 40:09.361
in States. That sometimes
the best solution

40:09.395 --> 40:11.796
is to put down the plunger
and pick up the phone.

40:11.831 --> 40:18.537
Okay, Occam, schmaccam.
Uh, 842 bucks?!

40:19.839 --> 40:21.940
- I'm sorry.
- It happens.

40:21.974 --> 40:24.276
So I hear there's
a new man in the picture.

40:24.310 --> 40:27.101
- Okay, not you too.
- Hey, I'm not prying. {*}

40:27.102 --> 40:29.925
I'm all for full privacy
in your personal life.

40:30.177 --> 40:32.366
- Really?
- Yeah, what you think I don't bring

40:32.462 --> 40:36.495
- Kiki around? They're like vultures.
- Oh. I am so glad to hear you say that.

40:36.720 --> 40:38.086
Anytime.
I hope it works out.

40:38.407 --> 40:42.580
Me too. I mean...
I don't know if it will...

40:42.795 --> 40:45.498
but if it does, we
could always double date...

40:45.713 --> 40:47.671
you and Kiki, and me and Ron.

40:47.828 --> 40:49.807
A-ha!

40:50.227 --> 40:54.179
It's Ron!
Ronny.

40:55.308 --> 40:58.112
Rono?

40:58.481 --> 41:00.452
Ron.

41:00.674 --> 41:03.963
Mm-hm.
Now I need his last name.

41:04.711 --> 41:06.323
<i>Smith?</i>

41:06.798 --> 41:08.400
<i>Jones?</i>

41:09.046 --> 41:12.936
- McGullikaty?
- She'd put you up to this?

41:13.669 --> 41:18.230
- I'd take the fifth.
- I'm gonna need one.

41:19.623 --> 41:23.752
Stein?
Burg? Steinburg!

41:24.170 --> 41:27.228
- I can do this all night, Ma.
- Unbelievable.

41:27.314 --> 41:31.612
- Now?
- Ronald McDonald? Yes!

41:34.137 --> 41:37.331
<i>- Why don't you just tell her?
- You are so...</i>
