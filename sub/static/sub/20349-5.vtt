00:04.833 --> 00:07.501
Ma'am, American University
is a fine institution.

00:07.503 --> 00:11.604
American University sounds like
a made-up college in Egypt.

00:11.606 --> 00:13.573
Okay? I don't want my library there.

00:13.575 --> 00:15.575
Well, technically, it
wouldn't even be a library.

00:15.577 --> 00:17.844
- What?
- It won't be a library, ma'am.

00:17.846 --> 00:19.946
No, I heard her. You
understand that, Amy,

00:19.948 --> 00:22.348
that even Richard has
trouble understanding you?

00:22.350 --> 00:24.684
You would be donating all
of your papers, gifts,

00:24.686 --> 00:26.686
and ephemera to them, to their library.

00:26.688 --> 00:28.521
Well, of course the dresses. I think...

00:28.523 --> 00:29.722
No, they don't want the dresses!

00:29.724 --> 00:33.259
You know that every president since FDR

00:33.261 --> 00:34.928
has had a goddamn library, okay?

00:34.930 --> 00:38.597
Even that sanctimonious
fraud Carter had a library.

00:38.599 --> 00:41.667
American University, it's
like American Univer-shit.

00:41.669 --> 00:44.336
Hey!

00:48.008 --> 00:49.408
<i>Thank you. Thank you!</i>

00:49.410 --> 00:52.278
I just wanna say that I
am so proud to be here

00:52.280 --> 00:53.845
- as a part of...
- National Volunteer Week.

00:53.847 --> 00:55.814
National Volunteer Week.

00:55.816 --> 00:58.617
Yeah, really important.

00:58.619 --> 01:01.053
Okay, thanks.

01:01.055 --> 01:04.590
Super. Great!

01:04.592 --> 01:07.826
How about that? How about that?

01:07.828 --> 01:11.162
I also do wallpaper.

01:11.164 --> 01:14.031
Thank you guys so much.
It's been so much fun.

01:14.033 --> 01:15.733
I love this T-shirt, too.

01:15.735 --> 01:18.069
It's just so happy and wonderful!

01:18.071 --> 01:21.306
Bye-bye! Thank you! Thank you.

01:21.308 --> 01:22.940
Get this T-shirt off of me.

01:22.942 --> 01:25.477
I look like I'm trying out
for "The Price is Right."

01:25.479 --> 01:27.948
God Almighty, I wish I'd
been assassinated in office.

01:27.950 --> 01:29.046
No, don't say that!

01:29.048 --> 01:31.415
Although, with my luck, I'd
be then crippled for life,

01:31.417 --> 01:35.786
sitting in a wheelchair in my reading
room with my name on the thing.

01:35.788 --> 01:37.454
They haven't agreed to putting
your name on anything, ma'am.

01:37.456 --> 01:38.956
- What?
- They said they haven't agreed

01:38.958 --> 01:40.658
to putting your name on anything, ma'am.

01:40.660 --> 01:43.760
- sync and corrections by Mr. C -
- www.addic7ed.com -

01:43.762 --> 01:47.498
That food was just disgusting.
Why did we even go there?

01:47.500 --> 01:48.632
Do you want me to get you anything else?

01:48.634 --> 01:49.966
You didn't eat anything.

01:49.968 --> 01:53.103
Oh, God, I hate every food ever,

01:53.105 --> 01:54.538
from everywhere.

01:54.540 --> 01:56.106
- Have you tried ice cream?
- Ugh.

01:56.108 --> 01:58.708
You know what, I was gonna
wait until afternoon tea,

01:58.710 --> 02:01.210
but I have got a fun surprise for ya.

02:01.212 --> 02:05.615
They have unveiled your wax
figure at Madame Tussauds!

02:05.617 --> 02:08.717
- Oh, is that the fun part?
- Check that out.

02:08.720 --> 02:11.755
What?! They have me next to Gerald Ford?

02:11.757 --> 02:14.090
Is this the Hall of Half-Term Wonders?

02:14.092 --> 02:15.591
I thought that was Craig T. Nelson.

02:15.593 --> 02:18.628
God, can nothing go right for me, ever?!

02:18.630 --> 02:20.596
What can I do? What can I do?
I will fix it.

02:20.598 --> 02:22.965
<i>Why do they even
have a wax figure of Ford?</i>

02:22.967 --> 02:25.268
- I don't know.
- The real one was made of wood.

02:25.270 --> 02:29.138
Get them to move me next
to... to Lincoln or to Mao

02:29.140 --> 02:31.940
- or some other game-changing icon!
- Aw, yes.

02:31.942 --> 02:33.706
That's what I am.
Don't make that noise!

02:34.311 --> 02:37.746
Just do it before I melt
down that whole collection

02:37.748 --> 02:39.247
and use it to wax

02:39.249 --> 02:44.153
Madame Tussauds' big, fat, nasty snatch!

02:44.155 --> 02:46.221
Oh, God, no.

02:46.223 --> 02:47.990
My pantyhose go up so high.

02:47.992 --> 02:49.857
Ma'am, it's normal

02:49.859 --> 02:53.961
to experience a temporary
depression after a heart attack.

02:53.963 --> 02:55.597
I went through it with my father.

02:55.599 --> 02:57.699
He was unbearable.

02:57.701 --> 03:00.368
Trust me, Amy, it was
not the heart attack

03:00.370 --> 03:02.070
that depressed your dad.

03:02.072 --> 03:03.905
<i>And anyway, I'm not depressed.</i>

03:03.907 --> 03:06.774
I just feel like I'm a thick, dark fog

03:06.776 --> 03:09.643
and everyone disappoints
me and nothing works out,

03:09.645 --> 03:11.179
<i>and what's the point of anything anyway?</i>

03:11.181 --> 03:12.714
<i>And before you ask,</i>

03:12.716 --> 03:15.016
it's not because I'm not sleeping, okay?

03:15.018 --> 03:17.151
'Cause I'm getting 14
hours of sleep a night.

03:17.153 --> 03:19.053
Hey, ma'am, if you ever
wanna talk to a therapist,

03:19.055 --> 03:20.487
I got a great gal.

03:20.489 --> 03:21.988
Wendy and I went to see her
when things were rocky.

03:21.990 --> 03:24.091
Both of them went to town on me.
It was brutal.

03:24.093 --> 03:26.594
I cried so hard, I threw up, but it
was the best thing I've ever done.

03:26.596 --> 03:28.995
Okay, look at me, Mike, all right?

03:28.997 --> 03:32.032
Not crazy, okay?

03:32.034 --> 03:33.767
- You know, Mom...
- What?

03:33.769 --> 03:35.636
therapists can help
with all kinds of problems

03:35.638 --> 03:37.304
that aren't necessarily mental illness.

03:37.306 --> 03:38.772
I mean, my woman is amazing.

03:38.774 --> 03:41.908
You're in therapy? Since when?

03:41.910 --> 03:43.810
Since I was 13.

03:43.812 --> 03:46.012
Well, what you really
needed was a dermatologist.

03:46.014 --> 03:47.881
Ma'am, have you done any more thinking

03:47.883 --> 03:50.751
about Catherine and me moving into
Mee-Maw's after the baby is born?

03:50.753 --> 03:52.753
Okay, Marjorie, that's, like, 14 things

03:52.755 --> 03:54.554
that I can't, you know...

03:54.556 --> 03:56.356
- So...
- You know, Dr. Diane thinks

03:56.358 --> 03:57.823
that it would be really
great if you could come in,

03:57.825 --> 03:59.759
that it could really
open up and facilitate

03:59.761 --> 04:01.494
good communication
between the two of us.

04:01.496 --> 04:04.230
Okay, well, Dr. Diane
is an asshole, okay?

04:04.232 --> 04:07.634
I'll tell you what else, I'm not gonna
carry that. I'm not carrying that either.

04:07.636 --> 04:10.069
Oh, Richard, can Catherine and
I speak with you for a moment?

04:10.071 --> 04:11.703
Well, you're the boss.

04:11.705 --> 04:15.007
Richard, are there any hereditary
issues that run in your family?

04:15.009 --> 04:17.676
Well, my father and I both
hate eating butterscotch,

04:17.678 --> 04:19.111
but love to say it.

04:19.113 --> 04:20.379
Butterscotch.

04:20.380 --> 04:21.413
Sorry, why do you ask?

04:24.318 --> 04:25.550
Thanks.

04:27.188 --> 04:30.322
Oh, fuck!

04:30.324 --> 04:32.557
"Wethinks Danny Boy Toy
doth protest too much.

04:32.559 --> 04:36.461
'Himbo' Egan Dan-ies affair
with NewsMILF, McCabe."

04:36.463 --> 04:39.130
All right, you know what? Fuck that.

04:39.132 --> 04:40.832
Hey, this isn't a library!

04:40.834 --> 04:42.801
Oh, no, it's a graveyard that sells gum.

04:42.803 --> 04:44.368
- Print is dead.
- You wanna buy some gum?

04:44.370 --> 04:46.271
No, I get all my gum on Amazon.

04:46.273 --> 04:49.007
<i>But if the check is
for the Rare Bird Conservancy,</i>

04:49.009 --> 04:51.943
then why does it have to go through
the Andrew H. Meyer Trust?

04:51.945 --> 04:53.778
That's a good catch, little Cat.

04:53.780 --> 04:54.979
Um, you know what?

04:54.981 --> 04:56.181
Just for tax purposes,

04:56.183 --> 04:58.082
why don't you make it out to cash?

04:58.084 --> 04:59.684
That's easy, hmm?

05:01.086 --> 05:02.886
I'll just leave it blank.

05:02.888 --> 05:04.322
It's not your drop-by day.

05:04.324 --> 05:05.556
I couldn't wait another moment

05:05.558 --> 05:07.257
to see my two favorite daughters.

05:07.259 --> 05:07.826
What?

05:07.828 --> 05:09.527
Where did little Madge
disappear to, anyway?

05:09.529 --> 05:12.330
You asked her to wait by your
street meter in case it ran out.

05:12.332 --> 05:14.498
Right. Darn.

05:15.036 --> 05:16.634
Morning, ma'am. Hey,
we really need to...

05:16.636 --> 05:18.468
I will wait in the living room.

05:18.470 --> 05:22.339
You're not giving any money to the
Music Man here, are you, sweetie?

05:22.341 --> 05:23.874
Have you no shame?

05:23.876 --> 05:25.508
- And, Mom.
- What?

05:25.510 --> 05:27.410
- Here is your monthly allowance.
- Okay.

05:27.412 --> 05:29.980
And what chores do you do around
the house to deserve that?

05:29.982 --> 05:31.381
I show assholes the door.

05:31.383 --> 05:33.350
Well, regardless,

05:33.352 --> 05:34.684
I bid you both adieu.

05:34.686 --> 05:36.619
- Flattering skirt.
- Shut up.

05:36.621 --> 05:38.087
Hey, Mike, sorry. I gotta get running.

05:38.089 --> 05:39.656
But your investment is doing well.

05:39.658 --> 05:41.324
I've never gotten a statement.

05:41.326 --> 05:44.193
Here's a statement... your
investment is doing quite well.

05:44.195 --> 05:48.130
- Can you believe the nerve of him?
- No, I can't.

05:48.132 --> 05:50.066
Ma'am, actually, I gotta talk to you.

05:50.068 --> 05:51.633
I got another call from the publisher.

05:51.635 --> 05:54.503
We need to buckle down and
start writing the book, okay?

05:54.505 --> 05:57.673
What if we started with when
Hughes selected you as his veep?

05:57.675 --> 05:59.141
I mean, the lies.

05:59.143 --> 06:01.543
The flagrant self-interest!

06:01.545 --> 06:02.845
Do you have any memory of that moment?

06:02.847 --> 06:04.881
Any details, any specifics?

06:04.883 --> 06:06.682
You know, during my
first win for Congress,

06:06.684 --> 06:09.217
he was cheating on me
during the entire campaign

06:09.219 --> 06:10.853
and said it was my fault.

06:10.855 --> 06:12.954
- I didn't know that. Okay.
- Yeah, absolutely he did.

06:12.956 --> 06:18.994
Andrew said that he was campaigning
long hours at the office for me.

06:18.996 --> 06:20.095
But what was he doing?

06:20.097 --> 06:22.898
He was fucking Louise Kellog for me,

06:22.900 --> 06:24.465
my goddamn press secretary.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.167
'Cause that's what he does, see?

06:26.169 --> 06:28.069
- He makes you...
- Who was your opponent in that race?

06:28.071 --> 06:30.305
Uh, I don't know. Some old white guy.
They're all the same.

06:30.307 --> 06:32.374
<i>And it was a really tight race.</i>

06:32.376 --> 06:34.109
Everybody said I was gonna lose,

06:34.111 --> 06:35.977
and people were saying I was cold

06:35.979 --> 06:37.712
and that I was unrelatable.

06:37.714 --> 06:39.347
Down, down.

06:39.349 --> 06:41.248
Whatever happened to Louise Kellog?

06:41.250 --> 06:44.451
Oh, God, I made Andrew
can her slutty can.

06:44.453 --> 06:48.222
And then we just hired the least
fuckable press secretary we could find.

06:48.224 --> 06:50.824
Huh, that's actually right when
I started working with you.

06:50.826 --> 06:52.726
Hey, get up.

06:52.728 --> 06:54.228
- What?
- Give me that fork.

06:54.230 --> 06:55.562
- What? What? What gives?
- Up, up.

06:55.564 --> 06:57.597
Fundraising laws... no silverware.

06:57.599 --> 06:59.333
Yeah, if you sit, it's a meal,

06:59.335 --> 07:01.401
which is a gift, which is a bribe,

07:01.403 --> 07:03.169
which is a line of prison inmates

07:03.171 --> 07:05.505
standing on each other's shoulders
trying to sodomize you.

07:05.507 --> 07:08.174
Well, my feet hurt and
I'm really hungry.

07:08.176 --> 07:10.911
Well, that's why we told you to eat
a big meal before you got here!

07:10.913 --> 07:13.547
Well, I wasn't hungry then! And
I need to go to the bathroom.

07:13.549 --> 07:14.382
You just went.

07:14.384 --> 07:16.882
Hey, here he is, the
Macher of the Moment.

07:16.884 --> 07:19.552
- Mr. Tanz.
- Jonah, I want you to meet my wife, Lia,

07:19.554 --> 07:20.886
and daughter, Shawnee.

07:20.888 --> 07:23.323
Yeah, what'd I tell ya? He's tall, huh?

07:23.325 --> 07:27.093
Hi, Mrs. Tanz. Ms.
Tanz, you are smoking.

07:27.095 --> 07:28.661
I'm the daughter. Gross.

07:28.663 --> 07:30.997
- We have a six-year-old.
- Oh, mazel tov.

07:30.999 --> 07:32.531
Listen, I have a thought...
I wanna make sure

07:32.533 --> 07:34.500
that when you talk about
Daylight Savings Time,

07:34.502 --> 07:36.368
you don't forget to talk about crime.

07:36.370 --> 07:38.203
It'll get dark earlier all year long,

07:38.205 --> 07:41.474
which means more burglaries and
murders and rape through the roof.

07:41.476 --> 07:42.284
Wait, isn't that bad?

07:42.286 --> 07:44.477
Wait, wait, you didn't let
me get to the best part.

07:44.479 --> 07:47.680
More crime means more
for-profit prisons.

07:47.682 --> 07:49.448
We're gonna lock 'em up
and we're gonna fry 'em.

07:49.450 --> 07:51.083
What are you, a monster?

07:51.085 --> 07:53.151
If you kill them, they
can't get arrested again.

07:53.153 --> 07:55.653
- That's how we make our money.
- Processing fees.

07:55.655 --> 07:57.589
<i> Right, which you would know</i>

07:57.591 --> 07:59.992
<i>if you hadn't been losing a
battle of wits with a meatball.</i>

07:59.994 --> 08:01.759
Great candidate, Dad.

08:01.761 --> 08:03.328
Impressive.

08:03.330 --> 08:04.929
I can see why you married the other one.

08:04.931 --> 08:07.031
- That's my Shawnee.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

08:07.033 --> 08:09.000
- Moe.
- You better go and fix this, okay?

08:09.002 --> 08:12.837
And go do it fast before Kent invites
her to a Sudoku weekend in Vermont.

08:12.839 --> 08:15.139
- I don't like that.
- Just go.

08:15.141 --> 08:18.142
Uh, excuse me, Shawnee.

08:18.144 --> 08:20.211
I don't know what your problem is,

08:20.213 --> 08:23.014
but I've been underestimated
my entire life.

08:23.016 --> 08:25.116
Failure to thrive at birth... fuck that.

08:25.118 --> 08:28.819
Puberty at 19. When it hit, it
hit like a fucking thunderbolt.

08:28.821 --> 08:30.888
Third grade reading level
in the tenth grade.

08:30.890 --> 08:33.524
Everything that I have been
through in my entire life

08:33.525 --> 08:35.893
has only made me stronger and taller.

08:35.895 --> 08:38.662
Get those fucking
meatballs away from me.

08:41.466 --> 08:43.198
<i>Ma'am, can you
believe the sun is up?</i>

08:43.201 --> 08:44.434
<i>Oh, look at this.</i>

08:44.436 --> 08:46.236
There's my horse, Chicklet.

08:46.238 --> 08:47.197
Aw.

08:47.199 --> 08:50.073
I begged Daddy to get
her for me, and he did.

08:50.075 --> 08:53.877
I remember he said, "Squirrel,
you're an intense little girl,

08:53.879 --> 08:57.680
and now you finally have a friend."

08:57.682 --> 09:01.184
- Aw, he called you "Squirrel."
- Mother up and sold her.

09:01.186 --> 09:04.120
She hated all animals that
she couldn't eat or wear.

09:04.122 --> 09:07.057
Anyway, eventually,

09:07.059 --> 09:10.760
Daddy changed that
stable into his office.

09:10.762 --> 09:12.662
So, how did he die?

09:12.664 --> 09:13.829
Heart attack.

09:13.831 --> 09:15.431
Like father, like daughter.

09:15.433 --> 09:17.967
Boy, I'll tell you, I
remember that night he died

09:17.969 --> 09:22.772
'cause his secretary came banging
on the door at, like, 2:00 AM.

09:22.774 --> 09:25.174
- Oof.
- We don't have to talk about this stuff

09:25.176 --> 09:27.342
- if you don't want to.
- No, it's okay.

09:27.344 --> 09:29.445
I like talking about it, even with you.

09:29.447 --> 09:33.148
Hmm, see? I'm not so bad once you
get to know me after 20 years.

09:33.150 --> 09:35.117
Yeah, exactly.

09:35.119 --> 09:37.252
<i>In 10 years, we'll be
taking vacations together.</i>

09:37.254 --> 09:39.054
<i>Go on!</i>

09:39.056 --> 09:41.723
- I'd go to Sandals.
- I hope the book's done by then.

09:41.725 --> 09:43.892
Well, the book better
be done in 10 years

09:43.894 --> 09:46.928
<i> or I'll be broke as a...</i>

09:46.930 --> 09:49.130
What's going on here?

09:49.132 --> 09:51.700
You guys having a party...
party by the fire?

09:51.702 --> 09:54.168
- Yes!
- Oh, can I join?

09:54.170 --> 09:55.604
- Sure!
- Oh.

09:55.606 --> 09:57.739
- We're so glad you're here.
- Aw.

09:57.741 --> 09:59.708
- I need breakfast.
- Okay.

09:59.710 --> 10:01.309
- Oh, can you help me up?
- Sure.

10:01.311 --> 10:03.411
Here, okay. I'll... I'll
get you from the back.

10:03.413 --> 10:05.012
- Get off of me!
- Right.

10:05.014 --> 10:06.414
So, what do you want
for breakfast, Mike?

10:06.416 --> 10:08.516
I usually have an
eight-egg white omelet.

10:08.518 --> 10:11.419
- And do you have sausage patties?
- What is this, Yonkers?

10:11.421 --> 10:13.354
- Just go and get sausage patties.
- Right, sure.

10:13.356 --> 10:15.789
- Do you wanna see my yearbook?
- Yeah!

10:15.791 --> 10:17.125
- Oh, yeah.
- High school years.

10:17.127 --> 10:19.093
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:19.095 --> 10:20.861
- Are you guys, like, besties now?
- I don't know.

10:20.863 --> 10:23.296
She hasn't yelled at
me in, like, 24 hours.

10:23.298 --> 10:24.832
- It's weird.
- It is weird.

10:24.834 --> 10:27.134
Hey, did you get me out
of the Gerry Ford ghetto?

10:27.136 --> 10:29.837
I did. You're bowing
next to President Lu.

10:29.839 --> 10:30.871
- Good.
- Can I see?

10:30.873 --> 10:32.405
Yeah, sure, sure.

10:32.407 --> 10:34.341
<i>- Morning!</i>
<i>- Morning.</i>

10:34.343 --> 10:36.276
- Hey!
- You guys had a slumber party.

10:36.278 --> 10:38.512
Yeah! So, listen, we're
about to get breakfast

10:38.514 --> 10:40.780
- <i> and Gary's gonna go...</i>
- Look at this.

10:40.782 --> 10:42.857
<i>and get something
called sausage patties.</i>

10:42.858 --> 10:43.915
Oh, my God!

10:43.918 --> 10:44.789
Look at the guy. He's like...

10:44.791 --> 10:46.620
<i>We still don't eat meat,
Mom, and we're on our way out.</i>

10:46.622 --> 10:49.222
- In your pajamas?
- It's athleisure-wear, ma'am.

10:49.224 --> 10:51.658
- Okay, that's not a word, Marjorie.
- That's disgusting!

10:51.660 --> 10:53.026
- Close it.
- All right, well,

10:53.028 --> 10:54.994
I don't even know why
I try with those two.

10:54.996 --> 10:56.663
- Honestly.
- Hey, ma'am,

10:56.665 --> 10:58.698
before we get back to work,
would you mind writing

10:58.700 --> 11:00.833
a letter of recommendation
to the Harper Day School?

11:00.835 --> 11:03.636
We're just trying to get Ellen in
there, and it'd be really good.

11:03.638 --> 11:05.304
- Wait, who?
- My oldest daughter.

11:05.306 --> 11:07.540
- Oh, that Chinese one?
- Sure.

11:07.542 --> 11:08.907
You write it, I'll sign it.

11:08.909 --> 11:10.276
- Really?
- <i> Sure!</i>

11:10.278 --> 11:11.677
Thank you so much, ma'am. Thank you.

11:11.679 --> 11:14.146
- Look at this.
- Oh, my gosh.

11:14.148 --> 11:15.904
Did you ever go through
an awkward phase?

11:15.906 --> 11:16.782
No!

11:16.784 --> 11:19.318
<i>Wow, I can't believe
I'm gonna be a father!</i>

11:19.320 --> 11:20.360
A lot of responsibility.

11:20.362 --> 11:22.354
You just signed away
all responsibility.

11:22.356 --> 11:24.422
I've never done this before.

11:24.424 --> 11:25.891
You just go in the room and...

11:25.893 --> 11:29.661
Uh, I've never shook the devil's hand.

11:29.663 --> 11:32.064
- Oh!
- You mean masturbate?

11:32.066 --> 11:33.765
Oh, self-husband.

11:33.767 --> 11:35.867
- Does it hurt?
- Oh, no, Richard.

11:35.869 --> 11:37.803
- It doesn't hurt. Wait, really?
- No, but how is that possible?

11:37.805 --> 11:39.571
Well, my family in Iowa
was pretty religious.

11:39.573 --> 11:41.573
Grandma Splett always said
that self-pleasure was a sin

11:41.575 --> 11:43.308
like microwaves or laughter.

11:43.310 --> 11:45.076
Do you need a minute or...?

11:45.078 --> 11:47.245
No. Worse comes to worst, I'll
burn in hell like Grandma Splett.

11:47.247 --> 11:49.250
You know what? He has
a really good heart.

11:50.183 --> 11:52.917
I'm sorry, I'm still understanding
how the cup comes into play.

11:52.919 --> 11:56.254
Oh, you... you just have to aim

11:56.256 --> 11:57.554
and... and what...

11:57.556 --> 11:58.889
How many of these do I need to fill up?

11:58.891 --> 12:00.524
Yeah, no, you just have to do one.

12:00.526 --> 12:02.126
Just one? Okay. I think
that'll be easier.

12:02.128 --> 12:03.828
How will I know when I'm done?

12:03.830 --> 12:05.763
You know, I'll figure it out.
I'll probably figure it out.

12:08.768 --> 12:10.901
<i>Jonah.</i>

12:10.903 --> 12:13.070
- Hi.
- Hey. Hi.

12:13.072 --> 12:16.340
So, that really happened, huh?

12:16.342 --> 12:17.907
Why didn't you take me
back to your place?

12:17.909 --> 12:19.042
Do you live with your mom?

12:19.044 --> 12:20.910
No. Pfft, no. She wishes.

12:20.912 --> 12:23.179
I live in my office.
DC rents are insane,

12:23.181 --> 12:25.415
and Ben and Kent say I
can't use campaign money.

12:25.417 --> 12:28.084
- Can I use campaign money?
- No, you can't use campaign money.

12:28.086 --> 12:29.386
Okay. Second opinion.

12:29.388 --> 12:31.621
I chose your outfit for the day,

12:31.623 --> 12:33.489
but I'm donating the rest of your suits

12:33.491 --> 12:35.925
to a charity for rescued
circus giraffes.

12:35.927 --> 12:37.961
I'm pretty sure I can take
care of dressing myself.

12:37.963 --> 12:40.596
- Can you?
- Hey, um, do you have time to...

12:40.598 --> 12:41.898
- No.
- Okay.

12:41.900 --> 12:43.199
It's just you look
really good in my robe,

12:43.201 --> 12:44.567
and I thought if you had some time,

12:44.569 --> 12:46.236
maybe I could finger you or something?

12:47.405 --> 12:49.171
No, I have to get going.

12:49.173 --> 12:51.741
- Okay.
- We'll fuck again tonight at 7:30

12:51.743 --> 12:52.975
with less kissing.

12:52.977 --> 12:54.644
Okay. Yeah, no, 7:30 works.

12:54.646 --> 12:56.412
- I'm taking a Pop-Tart.
- Can I ask you a question?

12:56.414 --> 12:58.514
- What?
- Just... this is the first time

12:58.516 --> 13:01.984
that that's happened since the
treatment, since the cancer,

13:01.986 --> 13:03.585
- and I...
- Oh, my God, get to it. What?

13:03.587 --> 13:05.087
Did my missing ball freak you out?

13:05.089 --> 13:07.589
Honestly, it was one less
thing to worry about.

13:07.591 --> 13:09.258
Okay. Thanks, Mrs. Tanz.

13:09.260 --> 13:11.359
- What?
- Ms. Tanz.

13:17.701 --> 13:20.302
Hey, Richard. Five-minute feud truce.

13:20.304 --> 13:23.538
The most amazing thing
just happened to me twice!

13:23.540 --> 13:25.573
Really? Something amazing
just happened to me, too!

13:25.575 --> 13:27.175
<i>- Amy?</i>
<i>- What do you want?</i>

13:27.177 --> 13:29.477
Okay, I had the president's wax figure

13:29.479 --> 13:32.547
relocated next to President Lu.

13:32.549 --> 13:33.782
And what's wrong?

13:33.784 --> 13:36.383
They have her bowing.

13:36.385 --> 13:38.252
Like this.

13:38.254 --> 13:39.653
I know what bowing is.

13:39.655 --> 13:41.289
People are...

13:43.126 --> 13:44.792
What? What?

13:45.995 --> 13:47.895
You know, like, taking advantage of her.

13:47.897 --> 13:49.230
They're fucking her in the ass?

13:49.232 --> 13:50.764
I have to see this.

13:58.741 --> 14:01.475
This girl is, like, 11 years old.
Where are her parents?

14:02.978 --> 14:05.312
Ugh. Obviously, you need me to fix this?

14:05.314 --> 14:07.047
I tried, but it's just...

14:07.049 --> 14:08.882
You're as useless as a
dick at a roller derby.

14:08.884 --> 14:10.750
And then there was this one time

14:10.752 --> 14:12.083
that Daddy got back
from a month in Cuba.

14:12.687 --> 14:15.621
- Cuba?
- Hey, green tea with a hint of rosemary.

14:15.623 --> 14:17.388
Okay, we're right in
the middle of working.

14:17.390 --> 14:18.591
Gary, can I get a Sprite?

14:18.593 --> 14:19.926
<i>Yeah, get him a Sprite.</i>

14:19.928 --> 14:22.628
Anyway, so Daddy never
came home empty-handed.

14:22.630 --> 14:24.289
I have the most amazing
snow globe collection.

14:25.067 --> 14:26.866
- No. Really?
- I haven't even shown you that yet.

14:26.868 --> 14:29.168
- Yeah, you're gonna die. Yeah.
- The board is ready for you.

14:29.170 --> 14:29.996
Oh, the... right.

14:29.997 --> 14:32.472
Oh, I bet you got a great
snow globe from Cuba.

14:32.474 --> 14:36.509
Oh, no. Actually, he brought
me back an ashtray from Cuba.

14:37.945 --> 14:40.413
Good morning. Selina Meyer present.

14:40.415 --> 14:42.348
We will now vote on the next item.

14:42.350 --> 14:44.516
I'm on the board of Biogenzidine.

14:44.518 --> 14:47.119
- What are you voting on?
- These vultures wanna raise the price

14:47.121 --> 14:48.888
- of some new cancer drug.
- <i> Ugh.</i>

14:48.890 --> 14:50.256
Aye.

14:50.258 --> 14:51.357
<i>Please re...</i>

14:51.359 --> 14:53.092
So, your dad was away a lot.

14:53.094 --> 14:56.795
Yeah, and he was away with
his secretary when he died,

14:56.797 --> 14:58.773
so I didn't get a chance
to say good-bye to him.

14:58.774 --> 14:59.431
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

14:59.433 --> 15:01.366
No, his secretary wasn't with him.

15:01.368 --> 15:03.968
She was the one pounding on the
door the night he died, remember?

15:03.970 --> 15:05.236
- No, I...
<i>-  Ma'am?</i>

15:05.238 --> 15:07.372
- Vote number two is up.
- Oh.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.409
- What is it?
- Animal testing.

15:10.411 --> 15:11.943
Aye.

15:11.945 --> 15:13.578
Ma'am, a lot of this stuff

15:13.580 --> 15:15.146
seems kind of weird, doesn't it?

15:15.148 --> 15:17.248
Weird? What are you getting at?

15:17.250 --> 15:21.386
Nothing. I'm... like, some of
these details about your dad

15:21.388 --> 15:23.763
are a little irregular,
like the Cuba trips...

15:23.765 --> 15:24.555
<i>No.</i>

15:24.557 --> 15:25.689
- <i> What?</i>
- all the cash.

15:25.691 --> 15:27.225
Hey, what is your game here?

15:27.227 --> 15:32.262
Because my daddy was a very
good family man, okay?

15:32.264 --> 15:35.198
He was charismatic, he was gregarious,

15:35.200 --> 15:37.134
he was somewhat peculiar, yeah...

15:37.780 --> 15:39.703
but all interesting
people are, okay?!

15:39.705 --> 15:41.439
So, put that in your stupid book!

15:41.441 --> 15:43.441
- Thank you.
- No, we're not gonna have any Sprite.

15:43.443 --> 15:44.608
This isn't a movie theater.

15:47.079 --> 15:49.879
I wonder if it'd be worth
checking in on Uncle George.

15:49.881 --> 15:51.714
We're not gonna talk to Uncle George!

15:51.716 --> 15:55.385
He's a bald, old booze-bag
with a whiskey-stink mustache,

15:55.387 --> 15:57.254
- just like you!
<i>- Ma'am?</i>

15:57.256 --> 15:58.755
- Third vote.
- Nay.

15:58.757 --> 16:00.390
But it's for discounted
prescriptions for the elderly.

16:00.392 --> 16:02.092
Oh. Nay.

16:05.096 --> 16:07.797
I'll just sit here.

16:09.067 --> 16:10.567
I'm sorry I ruined the good vibe.

16:10.569 --> 16:12.435
I'm sorry I
ruined the good vibe.

16:12.437 --> 16:15.371
I've asked you before not to
do that impression, ma'am.

16:17.308 --> 16:20.142
I mean, do I fuck her? The
entire town thinks I am anyway.

16:20.144 --> 16:21.810
You're my mom's favorite couple.

16:21.812 --> 16:23.612
It would be uncharted territory for me.

16:23.614 --> 16:25.147
Sort of like Indiana Jones, I guess.

16:25.149 --> 16:26.983
Digging my way through
the ancient ruins,

16:26.985 --> 16:29.318
hacking my way past the crazy
cobwebs and snakes and shit,

16:29.320 --> 16:31.253
hoping my face doesn't
melt when I open her up.

16:31.255 --> 16:34.723
I'm sure if I saw it, I would...
that would all make sense to me.

16:34.725 --> 16:36.692
- Amy.
- What are you doing here?

16:36.694 --> 16:39.628
- I said I would call you back.
- You also said you'd fix it, Amy.

16:39.630 --> 16:41.597
They put her on a bench talking to FDR.

16:41.599 --> 16:44.499
Zero anal access. How's
that for a new deal?

16:44.501 --> 16:45.633
You know what she's also doing?

16:45.635 --> 16:47.768
They have her gesturing like this.

16:47.770 --> 16:50.237
And people are resting their...

16:50.239 --> 16:51.706
Like, their balls?

16:51.708 --> 16:54.542
Not just the beans. Also, the franks.

16:54.544 --> 16:55.710
That's disgusting.

16:55.712 --> 16:57.077
<i>They will be arrested.</i>

16:57.079 --> 16:58.779
Will they? There's a lot there.

16:58.781 --> 17:01.681
There's a lot there. I got a
lot of pictures to show you.

17:01.683 --> 17:03.450
I don't see any arrests.

17:03.452 --> 17:05.819
- You see any arrests?
- Okay, okay, okay. Jesus.

17:05.820 --> 17:07.887
That is the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.

17:07.890 --> 17:09.256
You know, have sex with Jane McCabe,

17:09.258 --> 17:10.589
don't have sex with Jane McCabe,

17:10.592 --> 17:13.160
just do whatever it
takes to keep your job,

17:13.162 --> 17:14.961
because it is, in fact, a job.

17:14.963 --> 17:17.763
Or we could trade places,
and you could be in charge

17:17.766 --> 17:19.398
of a library that doesn't exist

17:19.401 --> 17:21.734
for a president who is
currently more famous

17:21.737 --> 17:24.604
for being a jizz sock for
Times Square tourists

17:24.606 --> 17:26.204
than for serving her country.

17:26.207 --> 17:28.340
Let's go, Gary.

17:28.343 --> 17:30.810
Jane McCabe? Wow!

17:30.812 --> 17:32.211
Respect.

17:33.915 --> 17:35.381
<i>Did I tell you the story</i>

17:35.383 --> 17:39.118
about how your father
made Ethel Merman cry?

17:39.120 --> 17:40.986
Oh, it's true, it's true

17:40.988 --> 17:43.089
'cause he tried to pull her wig off.

17:43.091 --> 17:45.091
He didn't like her Broadway show.

17:45.093 --> 17:47.593
So, I just wanna clarify
some of the details

17:47.595 --> 17:50.429
about the night that
Daddy actually died.

17:50.431 --> 17:53.032
Did Mother have to get the
body flown back here?

17:53.034 --> 17:55.601
What? No. Of course not.

17:55.603 --> 17:58.771
Oh, so, then how... how
did his body get back?

17:58.773 --> 18:01.239
From where? He died in the barn.

18:01.241 --> 18:02.942
No, he was away on business.

18:02.944 --> 18:05.744
No, that's just what we told her
when she was a little girl.

18:05.746 --> 18:07.512
- But you knew that, right?
- Mm-hmm.

18:07.514 --> 18:09.781
Her mother and I didn't
want her to see the body

18:09.783 --> 18:11.149
and poor Barbara.

18:11.151 --> 18:13.618
Barbara Valeski, Daddy's secretary?

18:13.620 --> 18:15.653
Died right on top of her.

18:15.655 --> 18:17.589
<i>What a way to go.</i>

18:17.591 --> 18:19.824
She was built, my God.

18:19.826 --> 18:21.626
Wait, uh, what?

18:21.628 --> 18:23.761
Yeah, she had to go to the
loony bin after that.

18:23.763 --> 18:27.331
Your mother paid for it. She always
referred to it as "the spa."

18:27.333 --> 18:28.933
- What?
- <i> But it wasn't just Barbara,</i>

18:28.935 --> 18:31.168
<i>which is why your mom
converted the barn,</i>

18:31.170 --> 18:34.205
so he wouldn't embarrass
her in seedy motels.

18:34.207 --> 18:37.875
See? That's why Mother sold my horse.

18:37.877 --> 18:39.210
- Okay.
- Write that down.

18:39.212 --> 18:40.511
What? No, no, no, no.

18:40.513 --> 18:43.914
Your dad sold it to get
the IRS off of his back.

18:43.916 --> 18:47.651
- <i> You knew that, right?</i>
- Dad... Daddy sold Chicklet?

18:47.653 --> 18:49.686
Your mother wasn't gonna
bail him out anymore.

18:49.688 --> 18:52.723
You know, she had a great
head for business.

18:52.725 --> 18:54.992
Damn fine lady. Mm.

18:54.994 --> 18:57.260
That's why you didn't get a snow globe.
No business trip.

18:57.262 --> 19:00.631
Oh, I haven't thought of those
snow globes in a million years.

19:00.633 --> 19:02.733
Yeah, we just were
unpacking all of them.

19:02.735 --> 19:04.701
Barbara loved buying you those.

19:04.703 --> 19:06.803
<i>You know, she had no
children of her own,</i>

19:06.805 --> 19:10.273
you know, because your dad was
always taking her to the doctor.

19:10.275 --> 19:14.310
- What a character.
- I gotta... I'm gonna get out of here.

19:14.312 --> 19:15.878
I'm gonna borrow that.

19:15.880 --> 19:17.480
Anytime, Madam President.

19:17.482 --> 19:19.715
Uncle George sounded pretty
sweet on Mee-Maw, huh?

19:19.717 --> 19:21.083
- What?
- Never mind.

19:23.844 --> 19:26.256
It's fun to drive again,
especially drunk.

19:26.258 --> 19:29.458
You know that my daddy taught me
to drive in this car right here?

19:29.460 --> 19:31.761
- Really?
- And once, I hit a deer,

19:31.763 --> 19:34.830
- and Daddy took the blame for it.
- Mmm.

19:34.832 --> 19:37.499
Careful, the ground isn't straight here.

19:40.538 --> 19:42.138
Oh, my God.

19:42.140 --> 19:44.339
Yeah, this is it.

19:44.341 --> 19:46.341
This was Chicklet's old house.

19:46.343 --> 19:48.743
- Wow! See this desk?
- Mm-hmm.

19:48.745 --> 19:52.747
After Daddy died, I would crawl
right underneath here and hide.

19:52.749 --> 19:53.675
Wow.

19:53.676 --> 19:56.451
You know, 'cause I was
so petite and pretty.

19:56.453 --> 19:58.487
- Uh-huh, yeah.
- And lookit here.

19:58.489 --> 20:01.390
I'd take this picture of me and Daddy.

20:01.392 --> 20:03.424
I would just stare at it.

20:03.426 --> 20:04.492
See?

20:07.230 --> 20:10.131
He was a cheater and a liar!

20:10.133 --> 20:13.134
He was a horse thief!

20:13.136 --> 20:16.705
I was stupid little Daddy's girl!

20:16.707 --> 20:18.406
You gotta do this, Mike. Come on.

20:18.408 --> 20:20.675
- Okay.
- God damn him!

20:20.677 --> 20:24.345
- Uh, bad desk!
- No, come on!

20:24.347 --> 20:27.248
You gotta be mad about something!

20:27.250 --> 20:30.150
Pay me! Pay me, bitch!

20:30.152 --> 20:32.687
Yeah, you pay him, you bitch!

20:32.689 --> 20:34.322
Pay me, bitch!

20:34.324 --> 20:35.756
Wait, stop!

20:37.760 --> 20:39.593
This is a pencil holder

20:39.595 --> 20:41.929
that I made for my daddy
when I was at camp.

20:41.931 --> 20:43.530
Okay, okay.

20:43.532 --> 20:45.398
- <i> Oh, yeah!</i>
- This feels good.

20:45.400 --> 20:48.501
- Why do shoes cost so much money?!
- He wasn't so perfect!

20:48.503 --> 20:50.503
He loved them and he was fucking them!

20:50.505 --> 20:53.172
- I wish I had peed first.
- Come on!

20:53.174 --> 20:56.175
- Why do I always wait so long to pee?
- <i> Oh, my God.</i>

20:56.177 --> 20:58.712
I'm a grown man!

20:58.714 --> 21:00.780
I shouldn't eat when I'm full!

21:08.322 --> 21:10.422
Ma'am! Ma'am!

21:10.424 --> 21:12.258
Move!

21:18.032 --> 21:18.965
Ma'am.

21:20.001 --> 21:21.700
Ma'am.

21:23.337 --> 21:25.070
Oh, God!

21:26.240 --> 21:28.206
- Are you all right?
- Sure.

21:28.208 --> 21:30.208
Easy. Oh.

21:30.210 --> 21:32.077
We did a number on this place.

21:32.079 --> 21:34.246
Jesus Christ.

21:34.248 --> 21:37.215
My mom was right and I ignored her,

21:37.217 --> 21:39.851
and I married my fucking father.

21:39.853 --> 21:42.487
We should call the fire department.
I smell smoke.

21:42.489 --> 21:44.222
This is the book.

21:44.224 --> 21:47.525
This is the story of the gifted girl

21:47.527 --> 21:51.329
who triumphed over her
parents' toxic marriage

21:51.331 --> 21:53.498
to become an American icon!

21:53.500 --> 21:57.535
Don't you see? I had no choice
but to go into politics

21:57.537 --> 22:00.171
and be extraordinary and a sex symbol.

22:00.173 --> 22:03.174
And you're gonna write it!

22:08.214 --> 22:11.182
Guys, it's fine.

22:11.184 --> 22:12.617
Mike crashed my car.

22:12.619 --> 22:14.785
He's completely wasted.

22:14.787 --> 22:17.387
I made this at camp.

22:17.389 --> 22:20.825
Look, I made it at camp.

22:22.761 --> 22:24.862
- Ma'am.
- Just leave him.

22:24.864 --> 22:27.264
And finally, an attempt
to break the record

22:27.266 --> 22:29.599
for cooking the world's
largest hamburger

22:29.601 --> 22:32.135
turned into an unhappy meal yesterday

22:32.137 --> 22:34.504
when the 45-foot-wide patty caught fire.

22:34.506 --> 22:35.457
Danny, Jane.

22:35.458 --> 22:38.308
That's Brie Ramachandran
with the world news.

22:38.310 --> 22:40.377
Boy, some scary moments there, I bet.

22:40.379 --> 22:41.978
- Frightening.
- Mm-hmm.

22:41.980 --> 22:44.481
Well, that's all the time we have.

22:44.483 --> 22:47.150
We'll see you in the tomorrow.

22:47.152 --> 22:48.952
- Bye, now.
- Bye.

22:48.954 --> 22:50.486
And we are clear.

22:50.488 --> 22:53.022
- Jane, perfect as always.
- Oh, please.

22:53.024 --> 22:54.958
Hey, so, Danny, before I
have a morning bagel,

22:54.960 --> 22:57.060
I just wanna make sure you
don't wanna fuck that, too.

22:57.062 --> 22:58.213
Page six.

22:58.214 --> 23:01.664
"Jane McCabe's boy toy steps
out with beefy blonde."

23:01.666 --> 23:03.733
What the fuck?

23:03.735 --> 23:05.968
Yeah, I don't think Jane's gonna
like you out with a younger woman.

23:05.970 --> 23:07.770
That's Amy Brookheimer,

23:07.772 --> 23:09.572
and she's way older than Jane.

23:09.574 --> 23:13.208
Hey, Jane, just wanna make
sure you're not mad about this

23:13.210 --> 23:17.045
because we're not actually
fucking, and you know that, right?

23:17.047 --> 23:19.749
Yes, Danny, I know that
we're not actually fucking

23:19.751 --> 23:21.083
because you're not a billionaire

23:21.085 --> 23:22.484
and I don't wanna catch anything.

23:22.486 --> 23:24.452
Okay, well, then maybe
you can call the "Post"

23:24.454 --> 23:26.721
and tell them that these rumors
about us are complete bullshit

23:26.723 --> 23:29.024
'cause this is like Dewey
blows Truman here.

23:29.026 --> 23:31.860
Dan, if I stop being
fuckable, then I am Grandma,

23:31.862 --> 23:35.130
and if I'm Grandma, I will be replaced

23:35.132 --> 23:39.768
by two tits with a degree from
American University over there.

23:42.472 --> 23:43.571
It's you.

23:43.573 --> 23:45.273
You're the one telling people.

23:45.275 --> 23:47.341
Smart and handsome.

23:49.078 --> 23:50.712
All right, the treasury secretary

23:50.714 --> 23:52.246
is meeting with House leadership

23:52.248 --> 23:54.015
about a hard date for the debt ceiling.

23:54.017 --> 23:56.150
Why do we always have
to raise the ceiling?

23:56.152 --> 23:58.852
So you don't scrape your head,
you giant barbecue fork.

23:58.854 --> 24:01.355
You need to get rid of your glasses.
They make you look smart.

24:01.357 --> 24:02.489
- Okay.
- Voters hate that.

24:02.491 --> 24:04.025
<i>Okay, next vote.</i>

24:04.027 --> 24:07.194
HR 2029, it's good,
old-fashioned pork barrel.

24:07.196 --> 24:09.596
Excuse me, don't say pork.
Shawnee's Jewish.

24:09.598 --> 24:12.332
Okay, just refer to
your color-coded chart.

24:12.334 --> 24:14.067
I've become close with
a woman at Kinko's

24:14.069 --> 24:16.202
who makes educational
materials for preschoolers.

24:16.204 --> 24:19.406
Come on, if the other congressmen
see me with a cheat sheet,

24:19.408 --> 24:20.808
they're gonna think I'm a fucking idiot.

24:20.810 --> 24:22.609
You can't unring that bell.

24:22.611 --> 24:24.511
Why can't we just write it
on my hand like we used to?

24:24.513 --> 24:27.113
That worked and I felt
good about myself.

24:27.115 --> 24:29.749
- Take your tie off.
- What? Like, right now?

24:29.751 --> 24:32.552
Okay, guys, will you just give
us eight to 10 minutes or so?

24:32.554 --> 24:34.554
No, you're switching to bow ties.

24:34.556 --> 24:36.256
No, I'm gonna look like
that old popcorn homo.

24:36.258 --> 24:39.159
You'll look like a school teacher
or a small-town grocer...

24:39.161 --> 24:41.627
good, solid New England professions.

24:41.629 --> 24:43.596
Yeah, or like a nation of Islam badass.

24:43.598 --> 24:47.099
Small-town grocers do poll
exceptionally well for probity.

24:47.101 --> 24:49.134
How do small-town child molesters poll?

24:49.136 --> 24:52.338
Oh, and you're voting against HR 2029.

24:52.340 --> 24:53.673
Wait, wait, Jesus, lady,

24:53.675 --> 24:56.375
we're talking about 300
jobs here at least.

24:56.377 --> 24:59.778
Jobs for wetlands duck-fuckers who
are never gonna vote for Jonah.

24:59.780 --> 25:01.813
Being against waste will play statewide,

25:01.815 --> 25:04.016
and even nationally.

25:04.018 --> 25:07.119
- Okay, vote no.
- Vote yes.

25:07.121 --> 25:09.721
If I vote no, can I turn
your drylands into wetlands?

25:09.723 --> 25:11.890
- Ugh, fine.
- Okay, thanks, babe.

25:11.892 --> 25:13.925
- Stop it. Clean this shit up.
- Okay.

25:13.927 --> 25:15.794
Kent, would you mind just
cleaning this shit up?

25:15.796 --> 25:17.963
Just straighten it up a
little bit for me? Thank you.

25:17.965 --> 25:22.367
Well, the female form is
a formidable adversary.

25:22.369 --> 25:25.470
Well, ironically, I have bigger tits.

25:25.472 --> 25:28.306
Ma'am, that's the letter of
recommendation for the Harper Day School.

25:28.308 --> 25:29.774
Yes, indeed, okay.

25:29.776 --> 25:31.743
- Ma'am, do you have a second?
- <i> Sure.</i>

25:31.745 --> 25:33.978
Catherine, Richard, and I have
something important to tell you.

25:33.980 --> 25:34.555
Okay.

25:34.557 --> 25:36.280
I think you're
gonna be really surprised.

25:36.282 --> 25:38.383
- Mom, what happened to your forehead?
- <i> Oh, it's nothing.</i>

25:38.385 --> 25:40.485
Mike and I were at Mee-Maw's last night

25:40.487 --> 25:42.820
and... oh, the stable got
wrecked, by the way.

25:42.822 --> 25:44.655
- What?
- How did the stable get wrecked?

25:44.657 --> 25:47.358
Anyway, you know how I have
been searching forever

25:47.360 --> 25:49.493
for the perfect place for my library,

25:49.495 --> 25:52.663
and all along, it's been
staring at me in my face!

25:52.665 --> 25:55.065
I'm gonna turn Mee-Maw's house

25:55.067 --> 25:59.302
into the Selina Meyer Presidential
Birthplace and Library.

25:59.304 --> 26:00.971
- Just like FDR.
- Yes!

26:00.973 --> 26:03.473
But wasn't Mee-Maw living in
Palm Beach when you were born?

26:03.475 --> 26:05.708
Catherine, I don't know! I was a baby.

26:05.710 --> 26:08.578
Okay, well, Marjorie and I were
planning on moving down there.

26:08.580 --> 26:10.247
I mean, we were gonna
have our family there.

26:10.249 --> 26:12.882
Well, Catherine, is there any
parade that you cannot rain on?

26:12.884 --> 26:14.851
Ma'am, I just got off with Sherman Tanz.

26:14.853 --> 26:15.603
Oh, and?

26:15.605 --> 26:17.854
He is all in for the
Birthplace and Library.

26:17.856 --> 26:21.925
- Ooh, I am so excited that he's excited.
<i>- Yes.</i>

26:21.927 --> 26:23.860
Well, he is asking one favor, though.

26:23.862 --> 26:25.127
Oh, of course he is.

26:25.129 --> 26:26.996
What does Rumpleforeskin want?

26:26.998 --> 26:28.598
Apparently, he is having trouble

26:28.600 --> 26:30.600
getting his son into
the Harper Day School,

26:30.602 --> 26:34.103
so Mr. Tanz would love a
letter of recommendation

26:34.105 --> 26:35.880
from the former President
of the Untied States.

26:35.882 --> 26:36.472
Oh, my God.

26:36.474 --> 26:37.607
Is he joking?

26:37.609 --> 26:39.275
I mean, I can't write

26:39.277 --> 26:41.643
multiple letters of recommendation

26:41.645 --> 26:43.412
to some grammar school.

26:43.414 --> 26:44.946
Mike, give me the letter.

26:47.317 --> 26:50.351
- And... and what is his son's name?
- Prescott.

26:50.353 --> 26:53.421
Prescott. Who does he think
he's trying to kid? Okay.

26:53.423 --> 26:56.324
Anyway, use this letter that Mike wrote.

26:56.326 --> 26:58.493
It's beautifully written,
too, by the way.

26:58.495 --> 27:00.462
Mike, would you mind fixing this all up?

27:00.464 --> 27:02.129
No, no. It'll just take a moment.

27:02.131 --> 27:03.397
It's for the library, though.
You know that, right?

27:03.399 --> 27:04.699
Sure. You want me to take out

27:04.701 --> 27:06.834
that I worked for you
diligently for 20 years?

27:06.836 --> 27:09.403
Diligently? I... I'm not
sure I concur with that.

27:09.405 --> 27:11.105
- Look, are you okay with this?
- Yeah.

27:11.107 --> 27:13.307
She's gonna get into the school anyway.

27:13.309 --> 27:15.776
- She's Asian.
- Sure.

27:15.778 --> 27:17.892
He can't afford private
school to begin with.

27:17.894 --> 27:19.179
That's what I told him.

27:19.181 --> 27:22.216
It's like she doesn't
hear me or even see me.

27:22.218 --> 27:25.586
And anytime she does, all she
cares about is tearing me down,

27:25.588 --> 27:26.993
and it's like she's
trying to ruin everything.

27:26.995 --> 27:27.621
<i>Okay, Catherine,</i>

27:27.623 --> 27:29.456
I know I'm not supposed
to interrupt you,

27:29.458 --> 27:32.159
but do you realize these
are the same complaints

27:32.161 --> 27:33.594
you've had for 15 years?

27:33.596 --> 27:35.528
Yeah, but they're not exactly the same.

27:35.530 --> 27:36.963
I think that things have changed.

27:36.965 --> 27:40.266
Okay, Catherine, sit up.
You're slouching.

27:40.268 --> 27:42.568
And what is that on your sweater?

27:42.570 --> 27:46.606
It's just, like, a woman's
face with sunglasses on.

27:46.608 --> 27:49.876
Let's stop for today.

27:49.878 --> 27:51.944
<i>What's happening
with my wax statue?</i>

27:51.946 --> 27:55.248
Gary and I were able to have you placed

27:55.250 --> 27:57.316
on the replica of the Truman Balcony.

27:57.318 --> 27:59.051
- Oh!
- So, it's very, very high up.

27:59.053 --> 28:01.787
- And safe.
- And you are encased in glass

28:01.789 --> 28:03.322
from the front and the back...

28:03.324 --> 28:04.990
- It's very safe.
- <i>um, all around.</i>

28:04.992 --> 28:06.692
It's very striking and stately.

28:06.694 --> 28:08.794
So, people were trying to
have sex with my statue.

28:08.796 --> 28:10.929
- Yeah.
- Domestic terrorism.

28:10.931 --> 28:13.231
Still, it's better than
standing next to Gerald Ford.

28:13.233 --> 28:14.967
- Oh.
- That's the spirit.

28:14.969 --> 28:17.536
See, when people get near this,

28:17.538 --> 28:19.504
- they just wanna do it.
- Oh, yeah.

28:19.506 --> 28:21.606
Thank God you're not trying
to do me all the time.

28:21.608 --> 28:23.608
Right?

28:23.610 --> 28:25.710
- You all right?
- Dominoes.
