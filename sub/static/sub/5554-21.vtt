00:00.801 --> 00:03.134
WALTER: <i> Previously on</i> Scorpion...
Okay, oh, yeah.

00:03.136 --> 00:04.969
LINDA:
Ooh, I'm sorry.

00:04.971 --> 00:07.071
Not good at first dates.

00:07.073 --> 00:08.306
Linda! (chuckles)

00:08.308 --> 00:10.975
DISTORTED VOICE:
Sabotage that launch

00:10.977 --> 00:12.143
or face the consequences.

00:12.145 --> 00:15.513
I think he's referring to this.

00:15.515 --> 00:18.316
This was not the worst date
that I've ever had.

00:18.318 --> 00:20.185
(loud explosion)

00:20.187 --> 00:22.253
Would you like to go
to dinner with me again?

00:22.255 --> 00:23.955
Oh, no.

00:23.957 --> 00:25.190
Meet my new trainee,

00:25.192 --> 00:26.324
Tim Armstrong.

00:26.326 --> 00:27.425
Hello.

00:27.427 --> 00:30.094
There's nothing
more stunning

00:30.096 --> 00:33.231
than seeing perfection
with a slight imperfection.

00:33.233 --> 00:35.166
Well, only got shot
in one place.

00:35.168 --> 00:37.168
(Tim and Paige laughing)

00:38.371 --> 00:40.405
<i> (Proton Arnold</i> music playing)

00:42.509 --> 00:44.609
SYLVESTER:
Holy smokes.

00:44.611 --> 00:46.277
You beat all
the Colonel Clones,

00:46.279 --> 00:47.412
you made it to
the Pardollus Galaxy

00:47.414 --> 00:48.847
and you still have
all your lives!

00:48.849 --> 00:50.315
While, ironically,
you have none.

00:50.317 --> 00:51.416
Can't you see how
incredible this is?

00:51.418 --> 00:53.301
He's putting on a clinic.

00:53.302 --> 00:55.185
Nah, I just used to play
this game when I was a kid.

00:55.188 --> 00:57.288
Actually,
the neurotransmission speed

00:57.290 --> 00:59.424
between your brain and
fingertips is pretty amazing.

01:01.027 --> 01:02.260
Ralph, you gotta see this.

01:02.262 --> 01:03.995
Ralph.

01:05.131 --> 01:06.297
Ralph, you're missing out!

01:07.334 --> 01:08.399
What is all the ruckus?

01:08.401 --> 01:10.134
History being made!

01:11.271 --> 01:13.004
Cabe's new trainee is about
to beat your high score.

01:13.006 --> 01:14.973
(scoffs) Well, that is
nearly impossible.

01:14.975 --> 01:16.274
I memorized
the graphic patterns

01:16.276 --> 01:18.243
and every
attack scenario.

01:18.245 --> 01:19.310
Yeah, but did you hone
your trigger finger

01:19.312 --> 01:20.478
with the SEALs
for half a decade?

01:20.480 --> 01:21.980
'Cause someone here did.

01:21.982 --> 01:23.482
WALTER:
Well, very good.

01:23.483 --> 01:24.983
But a physical advantage
will eventually wane

01:24.985 --> 01:26.517
in the face of
superior intellect.

01:26.519 --> 01:29.120
Walter, are you
threatened by this?

01:29.122 --> 01:30.188
No.

01:30.190 --> 01:31.422
It's a video game.

01:31.424 --> 01:32.957
A video game for which

01:32.959 --> 01:34.359
I possess the high score.

01:34.361 --> 01:35.393
For now.

01:35.395 --> 01:37.128
You seem threatened.
No, I'm not.

01:37.130 --> 01:38.329
I'm, uh, hungry.

01:38.331 --> 01:41.266
Are there any
egg bagels left?

01:41.268 --> 01:43.501
Uh... hey, boss.

01:46.673 --> 01:48.406
Linda. LINDA: Hi,

01:48.408 --> 01:49.474
Walter.

01:51.378 --> 01:53.378
Uh, no bomb this time.

01:53.380 --> 01:54.913
Just me.

01:56.316 --> 01:58.683
Uh, what are you...

01:58.685 --> 02:00.385
Doing here unannounced?

02:00.387 --> 02:03.388
In a bold and possibly
embarrassing move?

02:03.390 --> 02:05.490
Yes.

02:07.560 --> 02:09.060
Um...

02:10.330 --> 02:12.997
...can we talk in private?

02:12.999 --> 02:13.998
Oh, yeah.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.333
Um, sure.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.539
So...

02:21.541 --> 02:22.941
is everything okay?

02:22.943 --> 02:24.409
Yes.

02:24.411 --> 02:25.610
Well, kind of.

02:25.612 --> 02:28.413
Um... it's just...

02:28.415 --> 02:31.082
I have been thinking about you.

02:31.084 --> 02:32.250
A lot.

02:32.252 --> 02:33.685
Oh.

02:33.686 --> 02:35.119
I feel like I didn't
give you a fair shot.

02:35.121 --> 02:36.587
Especially after

02:36.589 --> 02:39.157
you went ahead and
saved my life and all.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.059
It was my fault
that you were in danger.

02:41.061 --> 02:43.294
I was just acting responsibly.

02:43.296 --> 02:46.064
And now... I am, too.

02:46.066 --> 02:47.999
I am taking responsibility

02:48.001 --> 02:51.102
for saying "no" to a date

02:51.104 --> 02:52.637
with a great guy.

02:54.607 --> 02:57.342
Unless you'd like to call it
a... a "joint social endeavor,"

02:57.344 --> 02:58.376
in which case,

02:58.378 --> 02:59.444
we could go on one of those?

02:59.446 --> 03:01.279
This is a pleasant surprise,

03:01.281 --> 03:03.448
because the truth is,

03:03.450 --> 03:05.350
I considered it
a statistical improbability

03:05.352 --> 03:06.484
that I would ever see you again.

03:06.486 --> 03:08.353
So...

03:08.355 --> 03:10.254
I'm glad that the odds
did not play out.

03:10.256 --> 03:11.422
(video game beeping)

03:11.424 --> 03:12.523
SYLVESTER (laughing):
New high score!

03:12.525 --> 03:14.492
(laughing)

03:14.494 --> 03:16.594
What is happening
in there?

03:16.596 --> 03:19.530
Another statistical
improbability.

03:25.338 --> 03:28.006
So... call me?

03:28.008 --> 03:30.074
I will... call you.

03:30.076 --> 03:31.442
Yes.
Okay.

03:39.119 --> 03:40.618
That was interesting.

03:40.620 --> 03:42.487
I'm hungry.
Are there any egg bagels left?

03:46.393 --> 03:47.392
Did she come by
for a date?

03:47.394 --> 03:49.460
Yes. Yeah, she did.

03:49.462 --> 03:52.497
I believe she thinks
I'm... dynamite.

03:56.536 --> 03:58.736
Don't use humor on the date,
'cause you're not funny.

03:58.738 --> 04:00.371
Otherwise,
this is a good thing.

04:00.373 --> 04:02.240
Paige and Tim seem
to be getting along

04:02.242 --> 04:04.208
and you should have someone
you get along with as well.

04:04.210 --> 04:05.710
Makes it easier
to let go of Paige.

04:05.712 --> 04:07.078
Sorry, "let go"?

04:07.080 --> 04:09.347
She's not mine to let go.

04:09.349 --> 04:11.215
We're friends.
We're co-workers.

04:11.217 --> 04:12.550
Oh, that's right.
That's my mistake.

04:12.552 --> 04:13.718
I keep forgetting,
'cause of the way

04:13.720 --> 04:15.153
you look, feel
and talk about her.

04:17.657 --> 04:20.558
Ralph, you missed
everything.

04:20.560 --> 04:21.526
Tim set the new high score

04:21.528 --> 04:23.294
on<i> Proton Arnold</i>

04:23.296 --> 04:24.662
and Walter just got asked out
on a date.

04:24.664 --> 04:26.364
Sorry.
I'm just finishing

04:26.366 --> 04:27.665
my coding project
for my college course.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.634
Check it out.

04:29.636 --> 04:32.570
(static plays over speakers)

04:33.640 --> 04:35.239
Um, all I hear is white noise.

04:35.241 --> 04:36.574
It's what you can't hear

04:36.576 --> 04:38.209
that's important.
It's sending data.

04:38.211 --> 04:39.577
(laughs) Wow.

04:39.579 --> 04:40.711
11 years old.

04:40.713 --> 04:42.580
That is unbelievable.

04:42.582 --> 04:45.316
I gotta get to physical therapy
for my back shrapnel,

04:45.318 --> 04:46.751
but I will see you guys
in about an hour.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.155
There's something encoded
in the static?

04:51.157 --> 04:52.490
It's more advanced than that.

04:52.492 --> 04:54.492
It uses apexes and
troughs of sound waves

04:54.494 --> 04:56.227
to transmit data at rates
millions of times faster

04:56.229 --> 04:58.429
than any available
software.

04:58.431 --> 05:01.232
The entire Library of Congress
in 5.9 seconds.

05:01.234 --> 05:02.600
Unbelievable.

05:04.337 --> 05:05.503
And the final
presentation's today?

05:05.505 --> 05:06.921
At 3:00.

05:06.922 --> 05:08.338
But first, he has
his spelling test

05:11.144 --> 05:12.227
at his regular school.

05:12.228 --> 05:13.311
It's like sending Seabiscuit
to give pony rides.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.545
Normal kids at normal school,
<i> then</i> college classes.

05:14.547 --> 05:15.580
That was the deal, right?

05:15.582 --> 05:17.748
Carpool's gonna be
here any second.

05:17.750 --> 05:18.616
Get your stuff together.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.587
I just saw Linda out
in the parking lot.

05:22.589 --> 05:25.156
Please tell me there isn't
another bomb in here. TOBY: Nope.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.358
She came by for something
potentially more disastrous.

05:27.360 --> 05:28.793
Thanks you for the support.

05:30.230 --> 05:31.496
Who's this?

05:31.497 --> 05:32.763
Gang, this is John Pandova,

05:32.765 --> 05:34.132
retired Marine.

05:34.134 --> 05:35.133
He'd like to retain
our services

05:35.135 --> 05:37.602
for a case of utmost importance.

05:37.604 --> 05:39.670
PANDOVA:
I've been with the Defense

05:39.672 --> 05:41.706
POW/MIA Accounting Agency
for 13 years now.

05:41.708 --> 05:43.741
We are charged with
locating and retrieving

05:43.743 --> 05:45.610
the remains of fallen
U.S. military personnel

05:45.612 --> 05:46.777
from around the globe.

05:46.779 --> 05:49.147
Now, our mission statement
is simple:

05:49.149 --> 05:51.616
We don't rest
until they are home.

05:51.618 --> 05:54.185
Well, you do incredible work,
Mr. Pandova.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.353
How can Scorpion help?

05:55.355 --> 05:56.354
Well, it has to do with this.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.788
It was found just outside

05:57.790 --> 06:00.191
the city of Pleiku, Vietnam.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.360
<i> The item was uncovered</i>
<i> by a construction company</i>

06:02.362 --> 06:03.528
<i> that was clearing a site</i>

06:03.530 --> 06:05.530
<i> for a factory build.</i>

06:05.532 --> 06:07.632
<i> Now, we believe they belong</i>
<i> to a Marine patrol</i>

06:07.634 --> 06:09.167
<i>that went missing in that area.</i>

06:09.169 --> 06:12.203
The patrol's radio died
on July 24, 1971,

06:12.205 --> 06:13.671
just after a brutal firefight

06:13.673 --> 06:15.473
from which none
of our men returned.

06:15.475 --> 06:17.708
There were ten
Marines MIA?

06:17.710 --> 06:18.709
Yeah, and now there are
ten families

06:18.711 --> 06:20.178
counting on me for closure.

06:20.180 --> 06:21.963
So you know
the general location,

06:21.964 --> 06:23.747
you have some evidence that
the remains might be there,

06:23.750 --> 06:25.283
so what's the issue?

06:25.285 --> 06:26.951
The issue is I can't get
approval for excavation

06:26.953 --> 06:28.452
without more specific evidence.

06:28.454 --> 06:29.720
Could be something
as simple as a dog tag

06:29.722 --> 06:31.722
from a solider that
we knew to be there.

06:31.724 --> 06:33.691
Now we have a better shot
than ever before

06:33.693 --> 06:35.459
of bringing these men home,

06:35.461 --> 06:36.794
but it is slipping away
by the minute.

06:36.796 --> 06:38.462
SYLVESTER: Don't tell
me they're still trying

06:38.464 --> 06:40.198
to build the factory
on this site?

06:40.199 --> 06:41.933
Even though the U.S. and
Vietnam are working together,

06:41.935 --> 06:44.202
there's still corruption
at the local level.

06:44.204 --> 06:45.636
Favors have
been granted,

06:45.638 --> 06:46.771
palms have been greased,

06:46.772 --> 06:47.905
and now I'm looking
at a ticking clock.

06:47.907 --> 06:49.674
How long until they
get back to building?

06:49.676 --> 06:51.275
Two days.

06:51.277 --> 06:52.944
I'm sorry, I thought you
said "two days."  Yeah.

06:52.946 --> 06:54.812
We just found
this ammo belt last week

06:54.814 --> 06:56.647
and the construction
company wants no delays.

06:56.649 --> 06:58.583
They're pushing hard
to move forward.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.685
CABE: If they build a
factory on that spot,

07:00.687 --> 07:02.720
we may never know
if the remains are there.

07:02.722 --> 07:03.888
HAPPY: I understand
the time pressure,

07:03.890 --> 07:06.557
but we're not archaeologists.

07:06.559 --> 07:07.959
Archaeologists
look into the past;

07:07.961 --> 07:09.727
I need people who can
see into the future.

07:09.729 --> 07:11.980
We use ground-imaging
technology

07:11.981 --> 07:14.232
and radar, but our equipment
is slow, inefficient.

07:14.234 --> 07:16.367
We need people who can
quickly accelerate

07:16.369 --> 07:18.469
the efficacy of our equipment.

07:18.471 --> 07:19.704
So if we can enhance

07:19.706 --> 07:21.372
the traditional
ground-scanning equipment,

07:21.374 --> 07:22.640
we can get you
definitive proof

07:22.642 --> 07:24.742
that the remains
are on that site.

07:24.744 --> 07:27.411
Yeah, that's all I need.
I know what's down there.

07:27.413 --> 07:29.013
What's necessary is getting
the right pictures of it.

07:29.015 --> 07:30.581
"Need"? "Necessary"?

07:30.583 --> 07:32.316
Your unequivocal
word choice is telling.

07:32.318 --> 07:34.318
This isn't
a standard case for you.

07:34.320 --> 07:35.519
As I said, we have limited time.

07:35.521 --> 07:36.587
I know,

07:36.589 --> 07:37.922
but I think
there's another reason.

07:37.924 --> 07:39.857
You've got mild
prognathism,

07:39.859 --> 07:41.025
a protrusion of the mandible.

07:41.027 --> 07:42.693
Some people call that

07:42.695 --> 07:44.729
a square jaw.

07:45.698 --> 07:47.365
Your father had that, too.

07:50.403 --> 07:51.736
I wasn't going
to mention it

07:51.738 --> 07:53.871
because this is much
bigger than just me.

07:53.873 --> 07:55.439
But the truth is,
my mom has been

07:55.441 --> 07:57.775
waiting 45 years
for him to come home.

07:57.777 --> 08:00.411
Now she's sick.

08:00.413 --> 08:01.946
She has six months to live,
give or take,

08:01.948 --> 08:04.448
and I need to do this for her.

08:04.450 --> 08:05.616
But with the red tape,

08:05.618 --> 08:07.752
it can take up to a decade

08:07.754 --> 08:08.953
to bring a body home.

08:08.955 --> 08:10.054
Not with our help.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.324
We'd be honored to assist you.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.059
Thank you.

08:16.696 --> 08:18.829
I'll get the plane ready
at Burbank.

08:22.969 --> 08:24.702
You seem concerned
about something.

08:27.440 --> 08:29.073
Yeah, um...

08:30.843 --> 08:33.511
I'm just a bit
confused

08:33.513 --> 08:34.645
why taking on this case

08:34.647 --> 08:36.380
was a foregone
conclusion to you.

08:36.382 --> 08:38.349
You don't think
recovering military personnel

08:38.351 --> 08:39.517
is worthy of our time?

08:39.519 --> 08:41.169
I didn't say that.

08:41.170 --> 08:42.820
I was talking about the logic
of taking on this matter.

08:42.822 --> 08:44.756
PAIGE:
Walt, people lost family.

08:44.757 --> 08:46.691
Have you forgotten
how you felt when Megan passed?

08:46.693 --> 08:48.193
I felt awful.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.694
Because I missed<i> who</i> she was,
not<i> what</i> she was.

08:49.696 --> 08:52.563
Her organic material
meant nothing to me.

08:52.565 --> 08:53.831
I kept her ashes

08:53.833 --> 08:55.700
in a coffee can in my glove box.

08:55.702 --> 08:58.336
And that's
messed up, Walt.

08:58.338 --> 09:00.438
Son, regular people need
to get a sense of closure

09:00.440 --> 09:03.441
when they say good-bye
to a loved one.

09:03.443 --> 09:05.743
They need something
to say good-bye<i> to.</i>

09:05.745 --> 09:08.412
If you can't
grasp that now,

09:08.414 --> 09:09.747
maybe someday you will.

09:09.749 --> 09:11.382
In the meantime,

09:11.384 --> 09:13.617
we need to ship out.

09:26.532 --> 09:28.366
Blank dog tags?
HAPPY: Yep.

09:28.368 --> 09:31.369
By programming their properties
into our software,

09:31.371 --> 09:32.903
we're telling it what
to look for underground.

09:32.905 --> 09:34.839
It's how we'll avoid
getting false positives

09:34.841 --> 09:36.407
off, say, an old soda can.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.025
Toby, belt buckle.

09:38.026 --> 09:39.642
One Vietnam-era Marine
belt buckle, coming up.

09:40.780 --> 09:43.414
Oh, uh, Homeland's gonna
have to reimburse me

09:43.416 --> 09:45.449
for this Army/Navy
store bill, by the way.

09:45.451 --> 09:46.934
Fine.

09:46.935 --> 09:48.418
You got a 25-tool
Swiss Army Knife on here.

09:48.421 --> 09:51.789
It's not exactly
era-appropriate.

09:51.791 --> 09:53.491
But it's really cool.

09:53.493 --> 09:54.575
You're paying for it.

09:54.576 --> 09:55.658
PANDOVA:
You mind explaining

09:55.661 --> 09:56.961
the designs on your tablet?

09:56.963 --> 09:58.596
Yeah, the magnetic
susceptibility meter

09:58.598 --> 09:59.930
and the magnetometer

09:59.932 --> 10:01.532
will locate our
underground evidence.

10:01.534 --> 10:03.534
And this is gonna photograph it.

10:03.536 --> 10:04.835
TIM:
Ground Penetrating Radar?

10:04.837 --> 10:06.904
HAPPY: But not like
you've ever seen it.

10:06.906 --> 10:09.974
I've goosed it to go dual
frequency at 1,000 megahertz

10:09.976 --> 10:11.509
by adding a second antenna.

10:11.511 --> 10:15.112
All of that,
and this DSP chip...

10:15.114 --> 10:16.514
only way we can get imaging

10:16.516 --> 10:18.916
of subterranean data
with 100% clarity.

10:18.918 --> 10:19.817
Subterranean.

10:19.819 --> 10:20.985
That's just like

10:20.986 --> 10:22.152
Walt's<i> Proton Arnold</i> score,

10:22.155 --> 10:23.754
buried deep under
Tim's new record.

10:23.756 --> 10:25.122
That's very clever, Toby.

10:25.124 --> 10:26.590
You know what?
If Dr. Rizzuto was here,

10:26.592 --> 10:28.492
he would say that
your behavior is...

10:28.494 --> 10:29.493
Yeah, well,
Dr. Rizzuto's not here.

10:29.495 --> 10:30.528
You know who is?

10:30.530 --> 10:31.746
The guy who beat
your high score.

10:31.747 --> 10:32.963
PAIGE: Would you both
please knock it off?

10:32.965 --> 10:34.014
I am trying to talk to Ralph.

10:34.015 --> 10:35.064
Are you ready
for your presentation?

10:35.067 --> 10:36.350
RALPH:
I am.

10:36.351 --> 10:37.634
But why'd you have
to have Sylvester

10:37.637 --> 10:39.037
stay back and watch me?

10:39.038 --> 10:40.438
Because he can do software
support from the garage

10:40.440 --> 10:41.772
and we won't be back
till tomorrow,

10:41.774 --> 10:44.775
and he doesn't charge
and babysitters do-- why?

10:44.777 --> 10:46.043
You love Sylvester.

10:46.045 --> 10:47.445
I do.

10:47.447 --> 10:50.681
But he's very enthusiastic.

10:50.683 --> 10:52.950
It's a packed house!

10:52.952 --> 10:55.786
I am so excited
for your presentation.

10:55.788 --> 10:56.954
I can see.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.725
All right, everyone,
I think we should all buckle in.

11:01.727 --> 11:02.927
Okay, honey, I need to go.

11:02.929 --> 11:04.228
I love you.
Good luck.

11:04.230 --> 11:06.697
Whoa!

11:06.699 --> 11:08.232
It's getting a little bumpy.

11:08.234 --> 11:09.567
PILOT:
Uh, looking at bad weather

11:09.569 --> 11:11.569
from here all the way
to Da Nang.

11:11.571 --> 11:13.537
Just stay seated
till we're through it.

11:14.540 --> 11:16.874
Ah, well, good thing
Sylvester isn't here.

11:16.876 --> 11:18.209
This turbulence
would freak him out.

11:18.211 --> 11:20.044
CABE:
You think it's bumpy up here,

11:20.046 --> 11:22.780
wait until you get on a road
in the Vietnam jungle.

11:36.229 --> 11:37.462
Hey.

11:37.463 --> 11:38.696
I heard what Toby
said earlier,

11:38.698 --> 11:39.830
and it's just a video game.

11:39.832 --> 11:41.031
I'm not trying
to compete with you.

11:41.033 --> 11:42.032
I just want to be an asset

11:42.034 --> 11:43.133
to the team
as long as I'm here.

11:43.135 --> 11:45.870
I know there's no competition.

11:48.975 --> 11:50.975
When we get there,
we better move fast.

11:50.977 --> 11:53.611
I don't like the
looks of this storm.

11:53.613 --> 11:55.579
Forget the storm-- I don't
like the look of those guys.

11:55.581 --> 11:57.648
(indistinct chatter)

12:07.927 --> 12:09.293
PANDOVA:
What the hell?

12:09.295 --> 12:11.529
What's with all the work?
We still got two days!

12:11.531 --> 12:13.030
I didn't think you were coming.
You late.

12:13.032 --> 12:14.698
We have much work to do.

12:14.700 --> 12:16.967
We had weather delays,
but we're here now.

12:16.969 --> 12:18.302
I have invested
much capital into building

12:18.304 --> 12:19.837
water and CO2 lines out here

12:19.839 --> 12:21.872
into the jungle.
I'm not gonna have you

12:21.874 --> 12:22.873
cost me any more money!

12:22.875 --> 12:23.908
Okay, excuse me,
sir, uh, me...

12:23.910 --> 12:25.976
Uh, I got this.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.227
Wow, even you don't
speak Vietnamese.

12:43.229 --> 12:44.628
Well, I could in an hour.

12:47.333 --> 12:48.732
Hey!

12:48.734 --> 12:51.602
(shouts in Vietnamese)

12:52.305 --> 12:53.571
Okay, good.

12:53.573 --> 12:54.705
Let's get set up.

12:54.707 --> 12:56.607
Cabe and Tim handle the tent.

12:56.609 --> 12:59.343
And let's get
the equipment ready.

13:01.581 --> 13:03.714
Storm's kicking up.

13:04.684 --> 13:06.750
(wind whistling)

13:09.355 --> 13:11.956
Whoa, nice catch.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.324
No worries.

13:16.629 --> 13:17.828
The case!

13:17.830 --> 13:19.363
Winds caught the tent!
Stake it down!

13:19.365 --> 13:21.765
That chip is the key
to the mission!

13:25.171 --> 13:26.337
Here, Toby!

13:33.879 --> 13:35.713
My side's secure!

13:35.715 --> 13:37.715
Mine, too!

13:38.718 --> 13:40.684
Okay, got everything?

13:40.686 --> 13:41.685
I think so.

13:41.687 --> 13:43.253
This storm was not on our radar.

13:43.255 --> 13:44.655
(phone ringing)
Literally.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.357
Oh.

13:46.359 --> 13:47.958
Sly?

13:47.960 --> 13:49.360
Guys, there's a storm
headed your way.

13:49.362 --> 13:51.028
After I heard the turbulence
on your flight,

13:51.030 --> 13:52.329
I jumped onto
some weather sites.

13:52.331 --> 13:53.731
How bad?

13:53.733 --> 13:55.733
Just got upgraded
to a category-two storm.

13:55.734 --> 13:57.734
Should reach category three
within two hours

13:57.737 --> 13:59.870
with winds up to 115,
120 miles per hour.

13:59.872 --> 14:01.138
We're in the valley.

14:01.139 --> 14:02.405
The gusts will blow
right through the site.

14:02.408 --> 14:04.108
Yeah, because of the valley's
tight topography,

14:04.109 --> 14:05.809
the effects of the storm
will be severely amplified.

14:05.811 --> 14:07.711
We got to be out of there
before that happens.

14:07.713 --> 14:09.563
TOBY:
Just to recap--

14:09.564 --> 14:11.414
we came here to do two years
worth of work in two days.

14:11.417 --> 14:13.884
(thunder crashes)

14:13.886 --> 14:15.953
And now we only have two hours.

14:19.892 --> 14:21.959
♪ ♪

14:29.335 --> 14:31.201
Hey, Happy,
I'm up and running over here.

14:31.203 --> 14:32.436
How goes it with you?

14:32.438 --> 14:35.039
Ready, I just need
to insert the DSP chip.

14:35.041 --> 14:36.907
Oh, no, no, no, no!

14:36.909 --> 14:38.175
It must've been broken
when the wind

14:38.177 --> 14:39.443
tossed the case
across the site.

14:39.445 --> 14:41.112
What does that mean for us?

14:41.113 --> 14:42.780
It means we can't get any
imaging on anything underground.

14:42.782 --> 14:44.081
We're useless without it.

14:44.083 --> 14:45.783
TOBY: Guys, I don't want
to be the quitter here,

14:45.785 --> 14:47.802
but if we can't do
what we came here to do,

14:47.803 --> 14:49.820
I say we hurry back to the city
and hunker down in a secure...

14:49.822 --> 14:52.322
No, I'm finishing
what I started!

14:52.324 --> 14:54.725
Respectfully, John, we're kind
of neutered without the chip.

14:56.028 --> 14:58.462
Is there a hospital nearby?

14:58.464 --> 15:01.699
Ultrasound machines run on
similar imaging technology.

15:01.701 --> 15:03.300
They might have the kind
of chip that we need.

15:03.302 --> 15:06.003
It's not gonna be perfect, but it will do.
There's no hospitals,

15:06.005 --> 15:07.137
but I know the area--
there's a nursing home

15:07.139 --> 15:09.006
five miles away.
I can take you there.

15:09.008 --> 15:10.974
I'll come.
Okay.

15:10.976 --> 15:12.176
Um, Walter can a little brusque.

15:12.178 --> 15:13.477
We want hospital administrators
giving us

15:13.479 --> 15:14.845
their equipment,
not calling the cops.

15:17.249 --> 15:19.049
Don't look so down, buddy.

15:19.051 --> 15:21.185
Have you ever got
a failing grade?

15:21.187 --> 15:22.953
(stammers)
Don't be ridiculous.

15:22.955 --> 15:24.221
Thanks.

15:24.223 --> 15:25.322
Oh, no, hey, hey, Ralph.

15:25.324 --> 15:28.192
What you coded
was incredibly advanced.

15:28.194 --> 15:29.993
Your professor
just couldn't follow it.

15:29.995 --> 15:32.096
People often reject
what they can't understand.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.731
Like my Super Fun Guy opera.

15:33.733 --> 15:34.832
(alarm rings)

15:34.834 --> 15:36.066
What's that?

15:36.068 --> 15:37.501
I remotely set up the computers

15:37.503 --> 15:40.370
to track the weather in Vietnam.

15:40.372 --> 15:41.905
Oh, no!

15:43.275 --> 15:45.042
This is not good.

15:45.044 --> 15:47.077
Uh, hi, guys?

15:48.881 --> 15:50.447
Sly, are you on comms?

15:50.449 --> 15:51.749
Yes.

15:51.751 --> 15:53.250
And I have bad news.

15:53.252 --> 15:55.102
The storm is

15:55.103 --> 15:56.953
going to reach category three
sooner than I thought.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.056
That does not surprise me.

15:59.058 --> 16:01.391
Okay, stay in communication.
We got our hands full.

16:01.393 --> 16:02.526
We might need you.

16:02.528 --> 16:04.495
Hello?

16:04.497 --> 16:05.863
Hello, do you speak English?

16:05.865 --> 16:07.297
Yes, but I cannot
help you right now.

16:07.299 --> 16:08.999
The storm started
an electrical fire.

16:09.001 --> 16:10.684
We cannot put it out.

16:10.685 --> 16:12.368
We have to evacuate
these people to safety.

16:12.371 --> 16:13.821
We won't slow you down.

16:13.822 --> 16:15.272
We need the DSP chip
from one of your ultrasounds.

16:15.274 --> 16:17.374
What?
It's only a loan.

16:17.376 --> 16:21.011
We need it for our GPR imaging
system that I designed, so--

16:21.013 --> 16:22.913
Walter, my turn. We're working
with the Vietnamese government

16:22.915 --> 16:24.882
to locate the remains
of U.S. servicemen.

16:24.884 --> 16:27.384
This chip will help
our device see underground.

16:27.386 --> 16:28.819
Please, there are

16:28.821 --> 16:31.021
people back home waiting
for their loved ones.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.992
Yeah, uh, inside.
Second door on the right.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.126
Okay, thank you.

16:36.128 --> 16:38.028
But be careful!

16:38.030 --> 16:39.163
There's a lot of smoke in there!

16:40.299 --> 16:42.933
(speaking Vietnamese)

16:44.336 --> 16:45.869
What does he say?

16:45.871 --> 16:48.071
Uh, he's repeating "spectre."

16:48.874 --> 16:50.240
WALTER:
Come on, come on!

16:50.242 --> 16:51.975
We don't have time for this.
We got to go.

16:56.448 --> 16:58.415
Here, let me help you
get them on board.

16:59.518 --> 17:02.152
Here, I'll hold this.

17:02.154 --> 17:03.921
(coughing)

17:03.923 --> 17:05.989
Over here!

17:09.461 --> 17:12.062
Over here.

17:12.064 --> 17:13.809
Okay.

17:13.810 --> 17:15.555
So we just need to
figure out a way

17:15.556 --> 17:17.301
how to open up the casing,
so we can access the chip.

17:17.303 --> 17:19.036
Hey...

17:19.038 --> 17:20.037
Open.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.438
Yeah, that'll do.

17:21.440 --> 17:24.208
All right, let's go.

17:27.046 --> 17:30.280
(indistinct chatter)

17:30.282 --> 17:32.015
Sir, that's it!
You're not gonna fit any more!

17:32.017 --> 17:34.017
I can't just leave
the others here.

17:34.019 --> 17:35.485
I won't get back
before the storm

17:35.487 --> 17:36.887
gets too dangerous for them.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.188
(all clamoring)

17:38.190 --> 17:40.357
PAIGE:
The roof tiles are flying off!

17:40.359 --> 17:42.292
I think it's already
too dangerous for them.

17:42.294 --> 17:43.927
(coughing)

17:43.929 --> 17:46.196
Paige, I got the chip.
We have to hurry.

17:46.198 --> 17:47.598
Walter, we can't abandon
these people.

17:47.600 --> 17:48.966
We're not abandoning them.

17:48.968 --> 17:50.133
Their doctors are with them.

17:50.135 --> 17:51.134
The doctors can't help.

17:51.136 --> 17:52.135
The storm snuck up on everybody.

17:52.137 --> 17:53.170
They're not prepared.

17:53.172 --> 17:54.688
We cannot drive off.

17:54.689 --> 17:56.205
We need to get them
in a building with a basement.

17:56.208 --> 17:58.008
We can use our vehicle
and take multiple trips.

17:58.010 --> 17:59.009
WALTER:
This isn't the city.

17:59.010 --> 18:00.009
I studied this region
on the plane.

18:00.012 --> 18:01.478
It's a flood zone.

18:01.479 --> 18:02.945
You don't build basements
in flood zones.

18:02.948 --> 18:04.047
You can't get them underground.

18:04.049 --> 18:06.016
Uh, are there tunnels nearby?

18:06.018 --> 18:08.085
(speaking in Vietnamese)

18:11.357 --> 18:13.190
There are tunnels
just over the hill.

18:13.192 --> 18:15.058
(man continues
speaking in Vietnamese)

18:15.060 --> 18:17.361
Sealed with aluminum covers.

18:17.363 --> 18:18.595
You start heading
for the hillside.

18:18.597 --> 18:20.264
I'll catch up.
Wait, where are you going?

18:20.266 --> 18:22.933
To get as many thermometers
from the nursing home as I can

18:22.935 --> 18:25.135
before it burns down!
(coughing)

18:26.472 --> 18:27.905
Hold it steady.

18:27.907 --> 18:29.539
Kind of hard when you're
rigging a baby-jogger

18:29.541 --> 18:31.408
in gale-force winds.

18:31.410 --> 18:33.210
Oh, my hat!
Hey!

18:33.212 --> 18:36.513
Hey, both hands on the wheel!

18:36.515 --> 18:39.149
And besides, I can take
a break from that hat.

18:39.151 --> 18:40.984
Me and the hat
are a package deal.

18:40.986 --> 18:42.119
Not anymore.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.287
CABE:
Just heard from Walter!

18:43.289 --> 18:46.156
He's behind schedule.
What?

18:46.158 --> 18:48.325
We got to set this up,
do a scan and get out of here!

18:48.327 --> 18:50.327
Can't do that without
that imaging chip!

18:50.329 --> 18:52.062
Seems like they ran into
some people in trouble.

18:52.064 --> 18:53.463
No, we're people in trouble.

18:57.002 --> 18:59.603
(shouting in Vietnamese)

19:04.043 --> 19:05.309
WALTER:
Yeah, the doctor was right!

19:05.311 --> 19:07.077
They bolted a thick,

19:07.079 --> 19:09.146
industrial aluminum cover
into the frame.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.547
PAIGE:
We don't have Happy

19:10.549 --> 19:12.482
or her tools
to get those bolts off.

19:12.484 --> 19:13.650
We don't need tools.

19:13.652 --> 19:16.520
We got thermometers.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.625
What the heck is he doing?

19:21.627 --> 19:23.427
Uh, it's been my experience
to-to wait a beat.

19:23.429 --> 19:26.063
He eventually explains himself.

19:27.266 --> 19:30.133
Now, recently, as a non-toxic

19:30.135 --> 19:33.270
alternative to mercury,
manufacturers started

19:33.272 --> 19:36.173
using a combination
of gallium, indium

19:36.175 --> 19:37.625
and tin in thermometers.

19:37.626 --> 19:39.076
See, you don't always know
what he's saying,

19:39.078 --> 19:40.143
but he explains himself.

19:40.145 --> 19:41.144
The gallium breaks down

19:41.146 --> 19:42.279
the bonds of aluminum,

19:42.281 --> 19:44.247
so you can do this.

19:46.618 --> 19:48.318
See?

19:50.089 --> 19:52.289
(speaking in Vietnamese)

19:52.291 --> 19:54.324
They'll be safe in there?

19:54.326 --> 19:56.393
Yeah, the storm will
pass right over them.

19:59.431 --> 20:00.530
(speaks Vietnamese)

20:00.532 --> 20:02.632
What is this man's
problem with me?

20:02.634 --> 20:04.134
What does it matter?

20:04.136 --> 20:05.402
We need to get back
to the excavation site

20:05.404 --> 20:07.137
so we're not in our car,

20:07.139 --> 20:09.206
out in the open
when the full storm hits.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.141
Just hang on!
What is he saying?

20:11.143 --> 20:13.177
Spectre again?

20:13.178 --> 20:15.212
(speaks Vietnamese)
He thinks you're an apparition!

20:15.214 --> 20:16.646
An apparition?

20:18.083 --> 20:21.018
He said he saw you
decades ago!

20:21.020 --> 20:23.253
PAIGE:
Do you think he means

20:23.255 --> 20:24.321
your father?

20:24.323 --> 20:27.124
Look.

20:27.126 --> 20:29.526
Do you recognize him?

20:30.729 --> 20:32.562
(speaks Vietnamese)
This is you.

20:32.564 --> 20:34.264
No, my father!

20:34.266 --> 20:35.198
My<i> cha!</i>

20:35.200 --> 20:36.233
<i> Cha? </i>
Yes.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.434
Do you recognize him?

20:37.436 --> 20:39.102
(speaking in Vietnamese)

20:39.104 --> 20:41.171
He said your father brave.

20:43.142 --> 20:44.741
He never forgot him.

20:44.743 --> 20:47.677
Soldiers don't forget the faces
of those they've killed.

20:50.616 --> 20:52.215
There was a battle.

20:52.217 --> 20:54.818
(speaks Vietnamese) Your
father died a hero's death

20:54.820 --> 20:57.788
in a stand of white pines
in the nearby valley.

20:57.790 --> 21:01.091
(speaks Vietnamese)

21:01.093 --> 21:02.159
He say he's sorry.

21:02.161 --> 21:04.261
He was just a boy.

21:09.201 --> 21:13.203
Tell him he was
drafted to fight.

21:13.205 --> 21:14.571
Just like my father.

21:16.275 --> 21:19.142
Tell him there is
no forgiveness necessary.

21:21.113 --> 21:23.246
Uh, we really need to go now
if we're gonna find the remains

21:23.248 --> 21:25.115
before that storm hits
the construction site.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.651
(speaking Vietnamese)

21:32.591 --> 21:34.291
Let's go!

21:36.195 --> 21:38.662
(engine starting
Power's up!

21:38.664 --> 21:40.330
We're ready to go!

21:40.332 --> 21:42.299
Uh, no, we're not,
not until we get that chip!

21:42.301 --> 21:43.366
We need Walt!

21:45.204 --> 21:46.470
Speak of the devil.

21:49.374 --> 21:50.373
I got it!

21:50.375 --> 21:51.775
Let's go!

21:51.777 --> 21:53.577
(low pulsing chirp)

21:55.781 --> 21:57.848
(thunder crashing)

22:01.120 --> 22:03.587
WALTER: They're almost
at the edge of the third grid.

22:03.589 --> 22:05.589
Well, for someone
who just met and forgave

22:05.591 --> 22:08.592
the man who killed his father,
he seems to be doing okay.

22:08.594 --> 22:10.594
(thunder crashes)

22:10.596 --> 22:13.263
I don't know how he's
keeping it together.

22:13.265 --> 22:16.266
In the military, you learn to
hold your emotions in check--

22:16.268 --> 22:19.603
you need to be on point--
but when the time is right,

22:19.605 --> 22:21.271
you need to acknowledge
and process those feelings,

22:21.273 --> 22:23.340
or they will eat you alive.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.342
That's exactly what I've been
trying to teach this team.

22:26.845 --> 22:29.279
You get any hits?

22:29.281 --> 22:32.149
No, G4 grid is clear,
move on to G5.

22:32.151 --> 22:34.351
Happy, direct the radar
at section G5.

22:34.353 --> 22:36.319
Stay in the area
where the white pines stood,

22:36.321 --> 22:37.787
where that man saw my father.

22:37.789 --> 22:39.723
Please. G5 is part
of the white pine area.

22:39.725 --> 22:42.325
You have to let me do my job.
CABE: Listen, John,

22:42.327 --> 22:44.794
the storm's almost on us,
and we're still coming up short.

22:44.796 --> 22:47.430
You can go, but I'm not leaving.

22:49.234 --> 22:51.635
Not now that I know
my father's here.

22:51.637 --> 22:53.270
Okay, if this guy
refuses to budge,

22:53.272 --> 22:54.504
there's a good chance he's
gonna be spending eternity

22:54.506 --> 22:56.606
in this valley with his father.

22:56.608 --> 22:58.275
We can't let his grief
cloud his judgment.

22:58.277 --> 22:59.709
(beeping)

22:59.711 --> 23:01.311
Uh, we got something.

23:01.313 --> 23:03.447
Oh, we got a hit.

23:03.448 --> 23:05.582
Happy, focus the radar
on the upper-left quadrant.

23:09.755 --> 23:11.588
Oh, those are shell
casings from an M-14,

23:11.590 --> 23:14.491
and that's the tip
of a rifle bayonet.

23:14.493 --> 23:15.959
Is that dog tags?

23:15.961 --> 23:17.761
PANDOVA:
Uh, that's exactly what we need.

23:17.763 --> 23:19.429
Something that shows
my father's platoon was here.

23:19.431 --> 23:20.597
Is-is still here.

23:20.599 --> 23:21.932
Sharpening focus.

23:21.934 --> 23:24.634
Does that say "O-V-A"?

23:24.636 --> 23:28.305
"Ova," as in "Pandova."

23:28.307 --> 23:30.574
Congratulations, son,
you got your proof.

23:30.576 --> 23:32.676
No one's gonna be digging
on this site now.

23:34.379 --> 23:36.580
SYLVESTER: Mother Nature might
have something to say about that.

23:36.582 --> 23:39.282
The storm is not
category three anymore.

23:39.284 --> 23:40.951
TOBY:
Something tells me

23:40.952 --> 23:42.619
you're not gonna say it's
turned into a spring shower.

23:42.621 --> 23:44.521
SYLVESTER:
Sadly, I am not.

23:44.523 --> 23:47.691
It is now a concentrated
supercell storm,

23:47.693 --> 23:50.627
and it's brought along
an F4 tornado

23:50.629 --> 23:52.395
that is headed straight for you.

23:57.502 --> 24:00.637
(thunder rumbles)

24:00.639 --> 24:02.505
A tornado?

24:02.507 --> 24:04.541
Well, if you're right,
where's the rain?

24:04.543 --> 24:06.243
Likely, a mile away in another
part of the supercell.

24:06.245 --> 24:08.445
Tornado just touched down
in the same valley as you.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.780
Currently three miles out.

24:10.782 --> 24:13.283
Path width, a mile.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.951
A mile-wide tornado?

24:14.953 --> 24:17.287
Mom, I want you
to get out of there.

24:17.289 --> 24:19.456
SYLVESTER: Calculations say if you
leave right now, (thunder crashes)

24:19.458 --> 24:21.958
you will barely beat the twister
and make it to the city in time.

24:21.960 --> 24:24.628
Okay, everybody, take
the laptops and the data.

24:24.630 --> 24:26.696
That's the proof that we need
to stop the construction.

24:26.698 --> 24:28.665
Just keep the radar
equipment behind.

24:30.035 --> 24:32.369
Pandova, we need to move!

24:32.371 --> 24:36.039
I grew up in Oklahoma, I know
what a tornado this size can do.

24:36.041 --> 24:37.607
Which is why we have to move.

24:37.609 --> 24:39.276
This twister will rip up
earth five-feet deep,

24:39.278 --> 24:42.312
destroy the remains,
scatter them up to 20 miles,

24:42.314 --> 24:44.981
and it never ends,
no one gets closure.

24:44.983 --> 24:46.700
If we stay,
our lives get closure.

24:46.701 --> 24:48.418
I understand the pain
you're feeling right now.

24:48.420 --> 24:49.586
All we can do is
save ourselves,

24:49.588 --> 24:51.354
which is why
we have to move now.

24:51.356 --> 24:52.689
SYLVESTER: About that,
the funnel ground speed

24:52.691 --> 24:55.458
has just increased
to 15 miles per hour.

24:55.460 --> 24:57.494
Your window for safe
departure has closed.

24:58.897 --> 25:00.630
You said we could
get out of here.

25:00.632 --> 25:02.299
Yes, you could have, but that
was before the ground speed

25:02.301 --> 25:03.633
increased to 15 miles per hour.

25:03.635 --> 25:05.335
Now, mathematically,

25:05.337 --> 25:07.337
there is no way for you to get
out of that valley in time.

25:07.339 --> 25:08.305
That's fantastic.
So we're dead.

25:08.307 --> 25:09.639
Don't be so negative.

25:09.641 --> 25:10.874
Stating facts is not negativity.

25:10.876 --> 25:13.476
We're in a valley
with no protection

25:13.478 --> 25:14.911
and an F3 tornado
bearing down on us.

25:14.913 --> 25:17.047
Actually, F4.
TOBY: Super.

25:17.049 --> 25:18.882
Since we can't control
the weather, we're toast.

25:18.884 --> 25:21.418
Not necessarily.

25:21.420 --> 25:23.086
Theoretically, we might
be able to do just that.

25:23.088 --> 25:25.455
Do just what?

25:25.457 --> 25:26.623
Control the weather.

25:26.625 --> 25:27.657
Uh, I think we've lost Walt.

25:27.659 --> 25:29.559
He's officially nuts.

25:29.560 --> 25:31.460
Okay, so a tornado needs
hot air to exist, right?

25:31.463 --> 25:33.330
Without it, it's done for.

25:33.332 --> 25:34.964
So we just need to cool the air.

25:34.966 --> 25:37.667
In case you haven't noticed,
it's 80 degrees in the jungle.

25:37.669 --> 25:40.003
Ah-huh, but we're
in the valley.

25:40.005 --> 25:41.104
Look.

25:41.106 --> 25:43.273
We're here.

25:43.274 --> 25:45.441
Now, according to Sly,
the tornado is currently here

25:45.444 --> 25:47.410
and moving toward us.

25:47.412 --> 25:50.580
So if we can somehow cool the
air that is feeding the funnel,

25:50.582 --> 25:52.849
specifically the rear
flank downdraft,

25:52.851 --> 25:54.851
by 15 degrees,
then we can go from twister

25:54.853 --> 25:56.986
to very severe windstorm.

25:56.988 --> 25:58.955
Excuse me, God Complex,
how exactly do you plan

25:58.957 --> 26:00.991
on making it cold in Vietnam?

26:00.992 --> 26:03.026
Dry ice. Remember, the owner
said he had built CO2 lines

26:03.028 --> 26:05.362
out here for his
factory's infrastructure?

26:05.364 --> 26:07.063
Yeah, but how do you
turn CO2 into dry ice?

26:07.065 --> 26:08.732
Easy. Back in the orphanage,

26:08.733 --> 26:10.400
I'd shoot fire extinguishers
into a pillowcase,

26:10.402 --> 26:13.703
seal it up tight, CO2 turns
into dry ice in seconds,

26:13.705 --> 26:16.506
then you can use it all kinds of
ways to get back at mean girls.

26:16.508 --> 26:18.408
She's right, except
for the revenge part.

26:18.410 --> 26:19.776
CABE: Have to assume
we're gonna need

26:19.777 --> 26:21.143
more than a pillowcase
worth of the stuff.

26:21.146 --> 26:23.580
Okay, so dry ice has
a latent heat of sublimation

26:23.582 --> 26:25.949
of 571 kilojoules
per kilogram.

26:25.951 --> 26:28.518
So about ten pounds absorbs

26:28.520 --> 26:31.521
2,590 kilojoules of heat.

26:31.523 --> 26:32.522
Walter, what's the answer?

26:32.524 --> 26:34.491
At least six cubic meters.

26:34.493 --> 26:36.593
That's 12,156 pounds.

26:36.595 --> 26:38.461
Which is why we're stealing
those construction trucks.

26:38.463 --> 26:39.929
Our version of the pillowcase

26:39.931 --> 26:41.731
are those dumpster
bags out there.

26:41.733 --> 26:43.583
Assuming we make 12,000
pounds of this stuff,

26:43.584 --> 26:45.434
will we just leave it out there
for the curbside pickup? Yes.

26:45.437 --> 26:47.437
Here, here and here.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.005
TOBY:
So we drop ice at intervals

26:49.007 --> 26:51.841
to give maximum cold exposure
to the spinning cloud.

26:51.843 --> 26:52.976
That's only half
as gonzo as it sounds.

26:52.978 --> 26:54.444
CABE:
Well, if this could work,

26:54.446 --> 26:55.712
why don't they do it in Kansas?

26:55.714 --> 26:56.679
It doesn't work
with the flat

26:56.681 --> 26:57.647
topography of
the Midwest.

26:57.649 --> 26:59.132
We're in a valley,

26:59.133 --> 27:00.616
so we know exactly where
the tornado is headed.

27:00.619 --> 27:01.785
It's trapped.

27:01.786 --> 27:02.952
Okay, Cabe, Happy,
Toby and Tim.

27:02.954 --> 27:04.554
Go commandeer the trucks.

27:05.824 --> 27:07.757
Pandova, download
the data that we found

27:07.758 --> 27:09.691
and e-mail it to a U.S. server,
so we can preserve your evidence

27:09.694 --> 27:11.861
in case we don't
make it out of here.

27:11.863 --> 27:12.695
Stay here.

27:12.697 --> 27:13.696
Right, Sylvester, Ralph.

27:13.698 --> 27:15.865
We need real-time data.

27:15.867 --> 27:17.867
That is, wind velocity,
core temperature.

27:17.869 --> 27:19.836
We need to know how fast
and how close that tornado is

27:19.838 --> 27:22.972
at all times, so hack
a government weather satellite.

27:22.974 --> 27:24.841
There will be at least
a ten-second delay

27:24.843 --> 27:26.843
if I get that information
from a satellite.

27:26.845 --> 27:27.794
Ten seconds can mean
life or death.

27:27.795 --> 27:28.744
We need instantaneous
information.

27:28.747 --> 27:30.647
I can't provide that.

27:30.649 --> 27:32.749
Ralph can.
Ralph, you need to link

27:32.751 --> 27:34.717
your software program
to the satellite.

27:34.719 --> 27:35.885
Now, if it can transfer

27:35.887 --> 27:37.337
the Library of Congress
in 5.9 seconds,

27:37.338 --> 27:38.788
then it can get us satellite
data in real time.

27:38.790 --> 27:40.123
RALPH: I don't think
that's a good idea.

27:40.125 --> 27:42.025
My professor failed me.
WALTER: Who cares?

27:42.027 --> 27:44.561
Y-your professor is a human,
you are a genius.

27:44.563 --> 27:46.563
Now, I have faith in your mind,
but if you don't,

27:46.565 --> 27:48.932
there is no point
in you having your ability.

27:50.101 --> 27:51.835
Ralph?
I can do it.

27:55.774 --> 27:57.807
Hey, need your truck!

27:57.809 --> 27:58.975
Listen, you can't
outrun the storm!

27:58.977 --> 28:02.011
(shouting in Vietnamese)

28:03.815 --> 28:04.948
I just got word
from my aunt

28:04.950 --> 28:06.783
that she was rescued
from a nursing home

28:06.785 --> 28:08.251
by a group of Americans.

28:08.253 --> 28:10.003
I assume it
was your team?

28:10.004 --> 28:11.754
It was, and we can save you
and your men if you trust us,

28:11.756 --> 28:13.089
but we need to get your trucks

28:13.091 --> 28:14.858
and a map of the CO2
line you built.

28:14.860 --> 28:17.861
Toby, Tim,
I sent you maps marked

28:17.863 --> 28:19.562
with the CO2 valve locations.

28:21.066 --> 28:21.931
Got it!

28:23.134 --> 28:24.801
Yeah, I'm looking
at it now, Walt.

28:24.803 --> 28:26.636
Sylvester, Ralph, status.

28:26.638 --> 28:28.004
The tornado's
core temp is 81.

28:28.006 --> 28:31.074
The wind velocity
is 240 miles per hour.

28:31.076 --> 28:34.844
and the ground speed
is staying steady at 15.

28:34.846 --> 28:37.247
That gives you 11 minutes
to get the ice in place.

28:37.249 --> 28:38.948
The data has no delay.

28:38.950 --> 28:40.683
Absolutely accurate.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.637
CABE:
Yeah, so far, so good!

29:00.639 --> 29:02.972
Bag's filling up with dry ice!

29:02.974 --> 29:03.940
Same here!

29:04.943 --> 29:06.609
We've got dry ice! It's working!

29:06.611 --> 29:08.711
Um, Walter,

29:08.713 --> 29:11.781
I'd really like to make the
ice delivery now if we can.

29:26.798 --> 29:28.831
Guys, the funnel is massive.

29:28.833 --> 29:30.867
We need to get every
ounce of the ice

29:30.869 --> 29:32.569
up into it as soon as possible.

29:32.571 --> 29:34.938
We see it.
We're almost at the ice drop.

29:34.940 --> 29:37.006
We're already in position!

29:40.712 --> 29:42.579
Let 'er rip, Tim!

29:51.723 --> 29:53.957
First batch of dry ice is down.

29:53.959 --> 29:55.325
Good, the uplift design
of the wind swirl

29:55.327 --> 29:57.327
will vacuum your ice first.

29:57.329 --> 30:00.196
Now get out of that area so you
don't get sucked up with it.

30:00.198 --> 30:03.366
I'm unwrapping our present as we
speak with my Swiss Army knife.

30:03.368 --> 30:06.369
Business expense.
Take that, Cabe.

30:06.371 --> 30:09.339
HAPPY: I know it's illogical,
but my reptilian brain

30:09.341 --> 30:11.107
is telling me we need
to find someplace safe.

30:11.109 --> 30:12.992
WALTER:
There is no place safe.

30:12.993 --> 30:14.876
The best you can do is head
back to the construction site.

30:14.879 --> 30:16.112
Now, if the dry ice
doesn't work,

30:16.113 --> 30:17.346
you'll at least have
gained a few minutes

30:17.349 --> 30:18.881
before you're sucked
into the tornado.

30:18.883 --> 30:20.750
Thanks, Walter.

30:20.752 --> 30:22.051
You're always
a source of comfort.

30:22.053 --> 30:23.786
Incoming!

30:27.058 --> 30:29.058
Toby just made
a sarcastic comment,

30:29.060 --> 30:30.727
and you didn't respond.
What's wrong?

30:30.729 --> 30:32.962
I didn't realize this pickup
was such a heap.

30:32.964 --> 30:34.998
I can't get it over
62 miles per hour.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.799
The calculations
regarding the drop spot

30:36.801 --> 30:37.934
assumed a faster speed.

30:37.936 --> 30:39.702
Won't get there in time?

30:39.704 --> 30:41.838
You will get there in time
to drop off the ice,

30:41.840 --> 30:45.708
but the problem is the tornado
will be arriving simultaneously.

30:45.710 --> 30:47.844
So when the ice gets
sucked up in the sky,

30:47.846 --> 30:49.846
you guys will be, too?

30:49.848 --> 30:51.314
No, there's not enough time
to stop the truck, unload it,

30:51.316 --> 30:53.249
get back in
and then turn around.

30:53.251 --> 30:55.284
Paige, I'll slow down,
you need to jump out.

30:55.286 --> 30:57.186
Absolutely not.

30:57.188 --> 30:58.421
Paige, please, listen to him
and get out of there!

30:58.423 --> 31:00.123
I am not letting him
drive this truck

31:00.125 --> 31:01.824
right into a tornado.
Hold on.

31:01.826 --> 31:03.393
We might not have to.

31:03.394 --> 31:04.961
Happy, what is the max cable
tension of this tailgate?

31:04.963 --> 31:07.830
About 4,200 pounds,
but I strongly advise against

31:07.832 --> 31:09.866
what I think you're about to try.
WALTER: Well, it's either that,

31:09.868 --> 31:11.601
or we become flying
storm debris.

31:11.602 --> 31:13.335
Now, Sly, I have over
4,000 pounds of ice

31:13.338 --> 31:15.171
in the bed of
a 5,000-pounds truck.

31:15.173 --> 31:19.242
Going 62 towards a tornado
a quarter mile away

31:19.244 --> 31:21.944
heading back at you
at 15 miles per hour.

31:23.682 --> 31:25.915
You know, actually...

31:25.917 --> 31:27.750
the tornado's winds
are slowing

31:27.752 --> 31:29.852
and its temperature is dropping,
which makes me think

31:29.854 --> 31:31.854
Happy's ice
was lifted into the twister

31:31.856 --> 31:33.873
along with Cabe's.

31:33.874 --> 31:35.891
But it is still deadly
and will remain so

31:35.894 --> 31:37.927
until you can get
your ice up into it

31:37.929 --> 31:39.228
to lower its temperature.

31:39.230 --> 31:41.264
I know the risks;
I need the numbers.

31:41.266 --> 31:42.615
How long do we have?

31:42.616 --> 31:43.965
Keep your gas pedal floored
and get ready

31:43.968 --> 31:45.001
to make your move
in exactly nine seconds.

31:45.003 --> 31:46.235
What move?

31:46.237 --> 31:47.103
You're gonna want to buckle in.

31:47.105 --> 31:48.304
I am buckled in!

31:48.306 --> 31:49.372
Then you're gonna
want to hold on!

31:50.809 --> 31:52.341
Ready in six, five...

31:52.343 --> 31:53.176
Four...

31:53.178 --> 31:54.177
Three...

31:54.179 --> 31:55.978
Come on, kid!
WALTER: Two...

31:55.980 --> 31:57.346
one!

32:11.129 --> 32:12.295
PAIGE:
It's working!

32:12.296 --> 32:13.462
The ice is getting
sucked up into the funnel.

32:13.465 --> 32:14.964
But it's right behind us.

32:14.966 --> 32:16.265
Yeah, we're going
four times as fast

32:16.267 --> 32:18.067
as the tornado
and the air temp's gonna drop

32:18.069 --> 32:19.202
and it's not gonna be a tornado

32:19.204 --> 32:20.503
much longer.

32:20.505 --> 32:23.005
(truck engine rattling)

32:23.007 --> 32:24.006

32:24.008 --> 32:25.007

(engine sputters)

32:33.818 --> 32:34.884
Come on.

32:36.287 --> 32:37.620
The truck broke down.

32:37.621 --> 32:38.954
I think that move was
way too much for it.

32:38.957 --> 32:40.256
Yeah, we're not going four times

32:40.258 --> 32:41.791
as fast as the storm
any more, Walter.

32:41.793 --> 32:43.443
We're going zero.
Zero is bad.

32:43.444 --> 32:45.094
Not good. Walt, you guys
gotta get out of there!

32:45.096 --> 32:46.996
Let's go!
Walt!

32:46.998 --> 32:48.264
Over there!

32:48.266 --> 32:49.198
It's almost on us!

32:53.905 --> 32:55.371
You know what?
We can't get away.

32:55.373 --> 32:57.039
So we're gonna buckle
your arm to the tree!

32:57.041 --> 32:58.941
