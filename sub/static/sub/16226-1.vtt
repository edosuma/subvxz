00:30.497 --> 00:34.456
<i>As far as con man stories go,</i>
<i>I think I've heard them all.</i>

00:34.534 --> 00:39.597
<i>Of grifters, ropers, faro-fixers,</i>
<i>tales drawn long and tall.</i>

00:40.540 --> 00:44.340
<i>But if one bears a bookmark</i>
<i>in the confidence man's tome,</i>

00:44.744 --> 00:49.374
<i>it would be that of Penelope,</i>
<i>and of the brothers Bloom.</i>

00:50.050 --> 00:52.678
<i>At 10 and 13, Bloom and Stephen,</i>

00:52.752 --> 00:54.743
<i>the younger and the old,</i>

00:54.821 --> 00:57.619
<i>had been through several foster families.</i>

00:58.992 --> 00:59.981
No!

01:00.360 --> 01:01.884
<i>Thirty-eight, all told.</i>

01:03.363 --> 01:05.593
<i>Mischief moved them on in life,</i>

01:05.665 --> 01:07.860
<i>and moving kept them close.</i>

01:07.934 --> 01:10.835
<i>For Bloom had Stephen,</i>
<i>and Stephen, Bloom,</i>

01:10.904 --> 01:13.031
<i>and both had more than most.</i>

01:14.140 --> 01:16.700
<i>Another home, another Main Street.</i>

01:16.776 --> 01:19.540
<i>Stephen looked around</i>
<i>and summed the burg up thusly.</i>

01:19.612 --> 01:22.410
Bloom, we've hit a one-hat town.

01:22.482 --> 01:26.942
<i>One theater. One car wash. One cafe.</i>
<i>One park. One cat,</i>

01:27.020 --> 01:29.887
<i>which, through some mishap, had one leg.</i>

01:29.956 --> 01:32.015
Sweet Jesus. Look at that.

01:33.193 --> 01:34.217
<i>One public school,</i>

01:34.294 --> 01:37.286
<i>one tight-knit group of local well-off kids.</i>

01:37.397 --> 01:40.093
<i>Their pocket-change bought rocket pops.</i>

01:40.166 --> 01:41.190
<i>The brothers...</i>

01:41.267 --> 01:42.598
Pixy Stix.

01:42.969 --> 01:47.531
<i>They were the they,</i>
<i>all well-loved, rooted, happy as you please,</i>

01:48.475 --> 01:51.137
<i>always there in every town.</i>

01:51.811 --> 01:54.075
Playground bourgeoisies.

02:16.870 --> 02:17.996
<i>Could he simply...</i>

02:18.071 --> 02:19.299
Talk to her!

02:20.573 --> 02:22.734
<i>Just drop his fears and go?</i>

02:23.143 --> 02:26.408
<i>Leave his brother in the woods,</i>
<i>and join the children?</i>

02:29.983 --> 02:31.245
<i>No.</i>

02:31.851 --> 02:36.447
<i>So, in the root of Stephen's psyche,</i>
<i>something now began.</i>

02:36.956 --> 02:41.086
<i>A seed of grand epiphany. A hook. A tale.</i>

02:41.161 --> 02:43.026
- A plan.
<i>- A fiction,</i>

02:43.096 --> 02:46.293
<i>both for profit</i>
<i>and to ease his brother's heart.</i>

02:46.499 --> 02:49.991
<i>A simple con in 15 steps.</i>

02:50.069 --> 02:52.970
And this is where we start.

02:54.674 --> 02:58.974
<i>And then, as if a curtain</i>
<i>had been pulled back from the sky,</i>

03:00.580 --> 03:04.072
<i>some barrier</i>
<i>within the younger Bloom was broken.</i>

03:04.584 --> 03:05.608
Hi.

03:07.687 --> 03:12.351
<i>So Bloom performed his role</i>
<i>in Stephen's story to a T.</i>

03:12.425 --> 03:16.361
<i>And being who he wasn't,</i>
<i>could be as he wished to be.</i>

03:33.513 --> 03:36.573
So, the tale. You tell them...

03:36.649 --> 03:39.083
There's a hermit in the woods.

03:39.152 --> 03:42.121
A one-eyed, steel-toothed vagabond.

03:42.188 --> 03:44.019
- With blood-red eyes?
- That's good.

03:44.090 --> 03:46.320
He stopped you, coming home from school.

03:46.392 --> 03:47.757
And told me of a cave.

03:47.827 --> 03:49.089
What kind of cave?

03:49.162 --> 03:51.096
A cave of wonder.

03:52.298 --> 03:53.424
Shut up, Dave.

03:53.499 --> 03:56.400
At noon on every Sunday,
there appears a ball of light,

03:56.469 --> 03:58.664
which flutters, like a butterfly.

03:58.738 --> 04:00.569
- A will-o'-wisp?
- That's right.

04:00.640 --> 04:01.800
It guides you...

04:01.874 --> 04:03.000
If you can keep up...

04:03.076 --> 04:04.509
...to where the treasures lay.

04:04.577 --> 04:06.568
- So where's this cave?
- Yeah, where?

04:07.847 --> 04:09.576
The hermit didn't say.

04:09.649 --> 04:14.086
He got this greedy,
glinting look, the filthy red-eyed leech,

04:14.153 --> 04:17.850
and said he'd tell for 30 bucks.

04:19.158 --> 04:21.490
Well, that's just 2 bucks each!

04:24.597 --> 04:27.657
<i>And so that Sunday, straight from church,</i>

04:27.734 --> 04:30.294
<i>into the woods Bloom led.</i>

04:35.842 --> 04:40.142
<i>They stopped. Their hearts leapt.</i>
<i>There it was.</i>

04:40.546 --> 04:42.571
Just like the hermit said.

04:58.765 --> 05:02.701
<i>For just one moment,</i>
<i>Bloom forgot himself and ran too fast.</i>

05:02.802 --> 05:05.737
<i>He'd catch the light and find the treasure,</i>

05:07.807 --> 05:09.798
<i>but the moment passed.</i>

05:23.456 --> 05:27.392
<i>They didn't catch the will-o'-wisp,</i>
<i>but didn't really care.</i>

05:27.660 --> 05:30.754
It seems to me that in the end,
the perfect con

05:30.830 --> 05:35.199
is where each one involved
gets just the thing they wanted.

05:36.002 --> 05:38.027
Yeah, I guess so.

05:38.104 --> 05:40.698
<i>Our fledgling thieves were satisfied.</i>

05:42.408 --> 05:44.774
<i>The children's parents, less so.</i>

05:51.884 --> 05:53.909
<i>A bitter ending? Maybe.</i>

05:54.053 --> 05:56.112
<i>But there's sweetness in the mix.</i>

05:56.422 --> 05:59.323
<i>The brothers Bloom had found their calling,</i>

05:59.392 --> 06:01.360
<i>as shown in number six.</i>

06:02.228 --> 06:03.718
<i>"Cut" meant to negotiate.</i>

06:03.796 --> 06:06.060
<i>"Percent," percentage deal.</i>

06:06.132 --> 06:09.533
<i>O'Henry's was the town's</i>
<i>one dry-clean shop.</i>

06:10.236 --> 06:12.830
Pleasure doing business with you.

06:15.408 --> 06:17.035
So how's it feel?

06:18.578 --> 06:22.605
<i>In truth, young Bloom</i>
<i>won't know for 20 years just how he felt.</i>

06:22.682 --> 06:25.310
<i>And so, we'll skip ahead now in our story.</i>

06:25.385 --> 06:26.852
Let 'em melt.

07:16.369 --> 07:17.734
He gets the scarab,

07:17.804 --> 07:20.466
you get the money, and I get the girl.

07:20.573 --> 07:23.804
So in the end,
everyone gets everything he wants.

07:27.246 --> 07:28.508
Victor!

07:31.684 --> 07:36.178
Charleston, what have you done?
Oh, my God.

07:38.057 --> 07:40.082
Oh, God, he's dead!

07:40.593 --> 07:43.084
He was the only one who knew
where our money was buried,

07:43.162 --> 07:47.121
and you shot him! Charleston, you dunce!

07:49.001 --> 07:51.162
The man named Charleston that you met

07:51.270 --> 07:53.363
four months and 1,000 years ago

07:53.439 --> 07:55.566
in a hotel bar in Jodhpur is dead.

07:56.509 --> 08:00.138
If we see each other again,
it'll be as strangers.

08:00.680 --> 08:02.807
As for the money,

08:06.385 --> 08:08.080
let it rot.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.683
Wow!

08:41.187 --> 08:44.816
"Wow" is the word you're looking for! Wow!

08:46.959 --> 08:48.756
You're a genius, Stephen.

08:48.828 --> 08:50.728
We're genius, Bloom.

08:52.331 --> 08:55.960
<i>Now, in defense of that shit-eating</i>
<i>grin on my older brother's face,</i>

08:56.035 --> 08:58.731
<i>what he just pulled off was pretty amazing.</i>

08:58.804 --> 09:01.739
<i>He hinged the entire con on this question.</i>

09:02.141 --> 09:04.632
<i>Would Charleston, our spineless mark,</i>

09:04.777 --> 09:07.302
<i>would he actually pull that trigger?</i>

09:08.581 --> 09:10.048
<i>Maybe.</i>

09:10.116 --> 09:11.674
<i>But Stephen wanted better odds.</i>

09:11.751 --> 09:14.242
<i>He positioned me in the same spot where,</i>
<i>six years ago,</i>

09:14.320 --> 09:16.880
<i>Charleston's wife had stood</i>
<i>and told him she was leaving.</i>

09:16.956 --> 09:18.924
<i>He picked my suit to match her outfit.</i>

09:18.991 --> 09:22.017
<i>He even phonetically matched</i>
<i>my final words to hers.</i>

09:22.094 --> 09:24.289
This is the end, Charleston.

09:24.430 --> 09:26.660
You've always been such a dunce.

09:26.799 --> 09:30.030
So in the end,
everyone gets everything he wants.

09:32.204 --> 09:33.535
Tastes like tinfoil.

09:33.606 --> 09:35.073
So does real blood.

09:35.708 --> 09:36.868
Buy you a drink?

09:41.247 --> 09:43.772
Nine months and 1,000 years ago.

09:43.849 --> 09:47.376
He was quoting from Kipling.
He stole that from Kipling.

09:47.887 --> 09:49.354
No, he didn't.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.322
So where's this wrap party?

09:51.390 --> 09:54.723
Make way, make room
for the brothers Bloom!

09:56.796 --> 09:58.593
Yeah, yeah!

10:00.633 --> 10:03.534
All right, here we go.
Gather round, friends and accomplices.

10:03.603 --> 10:06.572
Think of a card. You got it?

10:09.175 --> 10:10.301
No.

10:10.376 --> 10:12.674
If I do it enough,
someday it's gonna work on someone.

10:12.745 --> 10:16.272
And then it'll be
the best damn card trick in the world.

10:17.016 --> 10:20.144
It's true you never work
with the same crew twice?

10:20.219 --> 10:22.119
Well, shit. Except for the...

10:22.188 --> 10:23.212
Bang Bang?

10:23.289 --> 10:25.883
You know, I'm pretty big into anime.

10:26.158 --> 10:28.319
She's our fifth Beatle.

10:29.028 --> 10:31.155
She knows the ins and outs.

10:31.597 --> 10:34.657
I don't think she speaks
more than three words of English.

10:34.734 --> 10:35.792
Campari.

10:35.868 --> 10:38.769
So, she's with you and Bloom till the end?

10:38.838 --> 10:40.703
Till the wind changes.

11:03.396 --> 11:04.920
Where is Bloom?

11:18.644 --> 11:20.373
There you are.

11:20.713 --> 11:21.771
You hiding?

11:22.148 --> 11:23.206
Yep.

11:23.349 --> 11:25.249
I've been learning.

11:25.451 --> 11:27.351
Stephen likes to talk about you.

11:27.486 --> 11:29.386
He tell you the cave story?

11:29.622 --> 11:30.987
Is it true?

11:32.058 --> 11:34.117
What else did he tell you?

11:35.094 --> 11:38.154
You two kicked around until your early teens

11:38.230 --> 11:41.859
winding up in the grotty outskirts
of St. Petersburg,

11:42.501 --> 11:47.598
where you learned the big con from an
old-school grifter named the Diamond Dog.

11:47.907 --> 11:49.465
Is that true?

11:49.742 --> 11:51.937
- That was his name?
- Yep.

11:52.511 --> 11:54.672
And he was your mentor.

11:55.314 --> 11:57.805
But I get the sense it ended badly.

11:58.217 --> 12:01.311
Stephen took his eye out
with an antique rapier.

12:01.854 --> 12:03.583
Why did he do that?

12:03.689 --> 12:06.157
The brothers Bloom lit out on their own

12:06.292 --> 12:08.760
to make their fortune as gentleman thieves.

12:09.462 --> 12:11.089
Sounds romantic.

12:12.231 --> 12:13.459
It does.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.541
You don't understand what my brother does.

12:30.082 --> 12:33.518
He writes his cons
the way dead Russians write novels,

12:33.586 --> 12:37.215
with thematic arcs
and embedded symbolism and shit.

12:38.657 --> 12:41.649
And he wrote me as the vulnerable antihero.

12:44.263 --> 12:47.164
And that's why you think you wanna kiss me.

12:49.835 --> 12:51.200
It's a con.

12:58.110 --> 12:59.668
I'm going nuts.

13:03.282 --> 13:05.045
There's the big two.

13:15.861 --> 13:17.886
We missed the sunrise.

13:18.731 --> 13:20.995
That would have been nice.

13:32.311 --> 13:34.074
Is this the bathroom?

13:35.915 --> 13:37.780
No. This is camels.

13:38.984 --> 13:41.179
Hold on, I must make piss.

14:01.006 --> 14:03.201
At least you're honest. All right, let's do this.

14:03.275 --> 14:05.675
Let's just get it done. So, first you say,

14:05.744 --> 14:08.838
"I'm quitting, Stephen. I'm out." Then I say...

14:08.914 --> 14:10.973
- Do we have to go through this again?
- "Go through this again?"

14:11.050 --> 14:13.109
And then you make a show
of putting on your jacket,

14:13.185 --> 14:15.551
and you say, " No,
I mean it this time, Stephen.

14:15.621 --> 14:17.486
"This time, I'm really out."

14:17.556 --> 14:19.114
And then you say, "Let's have a drink,"

14:19.191 --> 14:22.991
"and in the morning, Bloom,
you'll have come to your senses."

14:23.696 --> 14:25.459
It's a major design
flaw in fake blood, by the way.

14:25.531 --> 14:27.465
- "And we'll be moving on."
- Real blood turns brown...

14:27.533 --> 14:28.898
- Listen to me, Stephen. I...
...after half an hour.

14:28.968 --> 14:30.663
This Scotch cost more than your suit.

14:30.736 --> 14:31.896
Listen to me.

14:32.037 --> 14:33.197
The flask stopped a bullet in Normandy.

14:33.272 --> 14:34.432
Listen!

14:39.345 --> 14:40.676
Holy shit.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.880
That's my new favorite camel.

14:50.990 --> 14:52.890
I hate you. Okay?

14:58.530 --> 15:01.931
Oh, God, I can't do this anymore.

15:02.001 --> 15:05.937
I can't wake up next to another person
who thinks they know me.

15:06.238 --> 15:08.536
And I'm 35 years old. I don't...

15:08.607 --> 15:10.837
I'm useless. I'm crippled.

15:11.310 --> 15:12.743
I don't...

15:13.445 --> 15:16.972
I've only ever lived life
through these roles that aren't me,

15:17.049 --> 15:19.381
that are written for me by you.

15:21.387 --> 15:23.014
Tell me what you want.

15:23.088 --> 15:25.921
Why? So you can write me a role
in a story where I get it?

15:25.991 --> 15:28.255
You're not listening to me!

15:28.327 --> 15:32.161
I want a real thing.

15:33.365 --> 15:35.333
I want a...

15:36.001 --> 15:38.731
I just... I want... I... want...

15:41.941 --> 15:45.468
- You want an unwritten life.
- I want an unwritten life.

15:50.482 --> 15:51.949
I'm going away,

15:52.017 --> 15:53.211
somewhere where you and Bang Bang

15:53.285 --> 15:54.411
won't even be able to track me down.

15:54.486 --> 15:57.717
So don't try it, okay? No more stories.

16:00.359 --> 16:02.623
I love you. Goodbye.

16:54.113 --> 16:55.205
How'd you find me?

16:55.347 --> 16:56.473
Bang Bang.

16:58.183 --> 16:59.946
How'd she find me?

17:02.121 --> 17:03.782
How you been?

17:05.590 --> 17:06.785
Great.

17:10.796 --> 17:14.196
I've been doing a lot of thinking
the past three months,

17:14.266 --> 17:17.291
and I've come to the conclusion
that you don't want out.

17:17.368 --> 17:19.859
You think you do, but you don't.

17:21.440 --> 17:24.034
Hey, come here.
I wanna show you something.

17:24.108 --> 17:25.804
I'm quit, Stephen.

17:31.750 --> 17:33.240
Where are we going?

17:33.318 --> 17:34.580
New Jersey.

17:36.121 --> 17:37.884
Let me grab my coat.

17:46.298 --> 17:48.892
So, where are we?

17:49.134 --> 17:51.967
The largest private residence
on the Eastern Seaboard,

17:52.037 --> 17:54.232
home of our final mark.

17:54.306 --> 17:56.365
Daddy was an oil tycoon, a Hearst type,

17:56.442 --> 17:59.809
built a Xanadu to match,
then died hunting quail.

18:00.245 --> 18:03.305
Mom followed
into the hereafter two years ago,

18:03.382 --> 18:06.909
after 10 years of fighting a disease
that I can't even pronounce.

18:06.985 --> 18:12.048
Thank you. Leaving our sucker all alone
on this ludicrous estate

18:13.759 --> 18:15.249
with an insane amount of very liquid assets.

18:15.327 --> 18:17.625
What the hell is that?
What are we, near an airport? What is that?

18:17.696 --> 18:18.788
Duck.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.593
What the hell?

19:06.145 --> 19:07.339
Get the car.

19:07.412 --> 19:10.438
- Bloom.
- No women. One rule.

19:10.649 --> 19:12.139
You know we don't do women.

19:12.217 --> 19:14.242
And it's not a morality thing or a thing.

19:14.319 --> 19:16.810
It's... Whatever it is,
it doesn't matter what it is,

19:16.889 --> 19:20.882
it's just our rule. So what are we...
Is this a '78 Caddy?

19:21.560 --> 19:23.221
Controversial choice.

19:23.295 --> 19:26.890
So no, is what I'm saying, all right?
I'm quits, anyway.

19:26.965 --> 19:29.297
I'll be in Montenegro, drinking.

19:31.003 --> 19:35.667
Ah, Penelope Stamp, 33.

19:36.141 --> 19:38.439
Lived at home her whole life.

19:41.914 --> 19:45.145
An eccentric shut-in rich bitch?
You're not helping your case.

19:45.217 --> 19:48.675
She's bored. She's a little seed in the snow.

19:48.754 --> 19:51.416
We're going to put her on a grand adventure,
bring her to life.

19:51.490 --> 19:53.287
She needs sprouting.

19:56.695 --> 19:58.720
So this is the big plan, huh?

19:58.797 --> 20:04.531
Lure me back in with some beautiful,
intriguing, elusive girl.

20:09.241 --> 20:12.506
Seriously, Stephen. Amateur night.

20:22.020 --> 20:24.682
I'm not saying yes, but what's the con?

20:24.756 --> 20:28.021
It's actually pretty simple.
We're brothers, antiquities dealers.

20:28.093 --> 20:30.220
We're traveling the world by steamer ship.

20:30.295 --> 20:33.924
Bang! Give her
the old cackle-bladder and the brush-off.

20:34.666 --> 20:36.133
And that's how it ends in Mexico,

20:36.201 --> 20:39.693
burst of violence,
then a moment of truth on the beach.

20:39.972 --> 20:41.769
What do you think?

20:41.840 --> 20:43.671
You got something up your sleeve.

20:44.843 --> 20:48.244
This is about me, right? Somehow.

20:52.050 --> 20:53.779
Now, this might not be
something that you know,

20:53.852 --> 20:56.184
but they've all been about you.

20:58.090 --> 21:00.388
Maybe that's why they've none been perfect,

21:00.459 --> 21:04.418
because I've never been
able to give you what you really wanted.

21:04.830 --> 21:07.458
This isn't gonna give me what I want.

21:21.513 --> 21:23.538
This will be the last one.

21:25.851 --> 21:26.875
You'll let me go.

21:26.952 --> 21:29.284
I'll never ask you to do another con again.

21:33.058 --> 21:34.923
Make it a Schwinn.

21:47.973 --> 21:51.568
There are less painful ways
to cut into a mark, you know.

21:53.545 --> 21:55.570
Score to beat is 7.9.

21:55.647 --> 21:59.481
Keep your head in the game.
The Japanese judge is very tough.

21:59.551 --> 22:01.678
This is a banana seat, man!

22:03.789 --> 22:04.949
Don't give me that blank look,

22:05.023 --> 22:07.321
you know what a goddamn banana seat is.

22:07.392 --> 22:08.620
Oh!

22:15.300 --> 22:16.460
Shit.

22:25.744 --> 22:26.836
Shit!

22:37.389 --> 22:38.583
<i>There's actually a knack to this.</i>

22:38.657 --> 22:41.683
<i>If you're trying to fast track</i>
<i>into a mark's sympathies,</i>

22:41.760 --> 22:44.126
<i>there's nothing quite as effective</i>

22:44.196 --> 22:46.528
<i>as having your first conversation</i>

22:46.598 --> 22:49.965
<i>be from a hospital bed they put you in.</i>

23:02.981 --> 23:06.246
What? Oh, come on.

23:55.534 --> 23:59.664
I actually think this is kind of
a great thing, and I'll tell you why.

24:00.172 --> 24:02.436
Dostoevsky was an epileptic.

24:03.341 --> 24:06.003
His seizures were preceded
by an enlightened euphoria,

24:06.077 --> 24:08.272
a sort of opening of his spiritual eye.

24:08.346 --> 24:12.214
I think the fact that she saw your face
the instant before a seizure

24:12.284 --> 24:16.050
is a pretty goddamn good foot
to start things off on, right?

24:22.394 --> 24:23.918
<i>The next step,</i>

24:23.995 --> 24:27.123
<i>is to figure out a way to insinuate yourself</i>
<i>into their personal life.</i>

24:29.801 --> 24:34.135
I think they took my car.
Could you drive me home?

24:37.309 --> 24:39.038
- Yeah.
- Okay.

24:39.811 --> 24:41.574
I'm gonna...

24:59.164 --> 25:01.530
<i>Step three, engagement.</i>

25:01.600 --> 25:04.501
<i>Find a connection with your mark</i>
<i>through conversation.</i>

25:04.569 --> 25:07.470
<i>Get invited in for coffee.</i>
<i>Tell them the full tale.</i>

25:07.539 --> 25:09.006
<i>Set your hook.</i>

25:09.074 --> 25:12.043
...didn't really have anyone
except each other growing up,

25:12.110 --> 25:16.513
and our father was in the antique business.
He had a shop in Charleston.

25:17.082 --> 25:20.017
We realized one day we saw the dealers

25:20.085 --> 25:22.918
who were finding and selling us the antiques

25:22.988 --> 25:26.890
coming from exotic countries,

25:27.959 --> 25:29.927
around the world, and...

25:30.695 --> 25:33.289
The air would, like,

25:33.965 --> 25:36.991
before a rain, you know,
the ions would line up,

25:37.068 --> 25:39.127
and you could just

25:42.374 --> 25:45.468
smell midnight trains to Paris

25:46.711 --> 25:50.772
and steamer ships
and Calcutta bazaars, and...

25:55.687 --> 25:58.815
It could... Excuse me, I'm sorry, uh...

25:59.090 --> 26:00.887
- Are you okay?
- Yeah!

26:01.526 --> 26:03.357
- Sorry.
- Okay. All right.

26:03.428 --> 26:05.055
I'm really bad at talking to people.

26:05.130 --> 26:06.688
That's okay.

26:10.869 --> 26:11.858
You want me to go?

26:11.937 --> 26:14.804
No. No, I really want to talk to you.

26:30.221 --> 26:31.347
So...

26:33.325 --> 26:35.520
What kind of stuff do you do?

26:36.928 --> 26:40.591
Nothing. Maybe you should go.

26:41.833 --> 26:43.232
All right, I'll just finish my...

26:43.301 --> 26:44.962
I collect hobbies.

26:45.804 --> 26:48.272
I see someone doing something I like,

26:48.406 --> 26:50.897
and I get books and I learn how to do it.

26:51.042 --> 26:52.031
Hmm.

26:52.978 --> 26:55.003
Anything interesting?

26:56.848 --> 26:58.213
Not really.

27:25.944 --> 27:29.141
<i>Like he had a disease</i>
<i>He robbed another and another and a...</i>

27:29.214 --> 27:31.273
- I really am not comfortable with this at all.
- I throw my right chainsaw...

27:31.349 --> 27:33.840
- This is a running chainsaw.
...into the air and I will catch.

27:43.928 --> 27:46.897
You just learn this stuff here by yourself?

27:49.067 --> 27:50.534
Kind of sad?

27:50.602 --> 27:51.796
No.

27:55.407 --> 27:57.932
So, how do you plan to use all these skills?

27:58.009 --> 28:01.501
I don't know. I'm not a planner.
I just do stuff.

28:02.347 --> 28:07.182
Like, look at this watermelon.
It's a pinhole camera.

28:07.252 --> 28:11.348
You can make a pinhole camera
out of anything hollow and dark.

28:12.891 --> 28:15.621
It's gotta warp the image though, right?

28:15.860 --> 28:17.555
Yeah, yeah it does.

28:17.696 --> 28:19.391
I mean, that's what's good about it.

28:19.964 --> 28:22.023
I mean, you could point this baby

28:22.167 --> 28:24.226
at the most menial, everyday little thing,

28:24.302 --> 28:27.328
like the fabric, or your...

28:29.441 --> 28:31.170
Your face, or anything,

28:31.242 --> 28:33.472
and depending on
how the pinhole eats the light,

28:33.545 --> 28:38.414
it's gonna be warped and peculiar
and imperfect and odd,

28:38.483 --> 28:41.919
and it's not gonna be reproduction,

28:41.986 --> 28:44.978
it's storytelling.

28:46.558 --> 28:48.549
It's a lie that tells the truth.

28:48.626 --> 28:50.560
I don't know about truths.

28:51.029 --> 28:53.327
A photograph is a secret about a secret.

28:53.465 --> 28:55.763
The more it tells you, less you know.

28:58.169 --> 29:00.228
What's changed between now
and 20 minutes ago?

29:00.305 --> 29:03.672
'Cause this is sort of like a conversation.

29:06.811 --> 29:08.403
Well, shit.

29:21.059 --> 29:24.051
<i>Throw my ticket out the window</i>

29:26.998 --> 29:29.967
<i>Throw my suitcase out there, too</i>

29:34.339 --> 29:37.331
<i>Throw my troubles out the door</i>

29:37.542 --> 29:40.204
<i>I don't need them anymore</i>

29:40.311 --> 29:43.212
<i>'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you</i>

29:43.281 --> 29:45.078
Well...

29:45.150 --> 29:46.549
I should...

29:47.952 --> 29:49.283
It's late.

29:49.921 --> 29:51.582
- So...
- So...

29:54.259 --> 29:56.557
I meet a lot of people in my job

29:56.628 --> 29:58.858
I have to professionally act interested in.

30:00.698 --> 30:04.361
It's a good feeling
to be genuinely interested in someone.

30:06.738 --> 30:08.330
Are you leaving?

30:10.041 --> 30:11.338
Yeah.

30:11.509 --> 30:12.533
Oh.

30:12.911 --> 30:14.310
Coming back?

30:14.712 --> 30:16.839
Well, next time I'm in town.

30:17.849 --> 30:20.545
We're taking a steamer at noon tomorrow
off the docks,

30:20.618 --> 30:22.848
to the continent for a few months.

30:22.921 --> 30:24.946
Paris and Greece, I think.

30:27.058 --> 30:28.923
I've got to get a hat.

30:29.227 --> 30:33.163
Well, thanks for
the pinhole camera demonstration.

30:33.231 --> 30:36.860
And the good conversation.

30:39.604 --> 30:40.935
All right.

30:44.409 --> 30:46.070
Goodbye, Penelope.

30:46.611 --> 30:48.169
Goodbye, Bloom.

31:05.163 --> 31:07.996
She isn't coming, man.
I need another day with her.

31:08.066 --> 31:09.761
You'll have two weeks with her on the boat.

31:09.834 --> 31:11.699
I need another day to get her on the boat.

31:11.769 --> 31:13.464
She's not hooked. I've had one session,

31:13.538 --> 31:17.201
and we mostly talked watermelons
and the optics of lensless photography.

31:17.275 --> 31:19.937
It's not the talking that hooked her.

31:20.011 --> 31:21.239
I think you're wrong.

31:21.646 --> 31:22.840
Hey, get out of the street, idiot!

31:24.048 --> 31:25.242
Watch it!

31:34.259 --> 31:36.124
- Hey.
- Hi.

31:39.664 --> 31:41.757
What are you doing here?

31:41.833 --> 31:42.822
Uh...

31:45.703 --> 31:50.367
I wanna give you this money
for the bike and for the whole thing.

31:50.441 --> 31:53.604
- That's all right. It's not necessary, really.
- Oh.

31:57.949 --> 32:00.713
Hey, where is this boat going?

32:23.408 --> 32:26.343
Penelope, my brother Stephen.

32:26.411 --> 32:28.572
Glad to make your acquaintance.

32:28.646 --> 32:30.307
Bloom's told me so much about you.

32:30.381 --> 32:32.941
You're the epileptic photographer?

32:33.017 --> 32:34.348
Sort of.

32:34.652 --> 32:36.950
And this is my personal assistant

32:38.122 --> 32:40.716
and private masseuse, Mrs. Yueng Ling.

32:41.259 --> 32:42.692
Yuengling like the beer?

32:42.827 --> 32:44.260
No.

32:49.400 --> 32:51.334
So, what are your plans in Greece?

32:51.402 --> 32:53.529
- I don't plan.
- Good for you.

33:08.586 --> 33:13.387
<i>When they begin the beguine</i>

33:14.959 --> 33:19.987
<i>It brings back the sound of music so tender</i>

33:20.498 --> 33:22.227
You look very nice.

33:22.300 --> 33:27.033
<i>It brings back a night of tropical splendor</i>

33:28.339 --> 33:32.799
<i>It brings back a memory of green</i>

33:36.214 --> 33:38.409
What was your childhood like?

33:39.017 --> 33:41.542
I made cameras out of watermelons.

33:43.354 --> 33:44.616
Lonely?

33:48.393 --> 33:54.127
When I was five, I got really bad rashes
and allergies and hay fever.

33:55.299 --> 33:57.597
So my mom took me to the doctor,

33:57.668 --> 33:59.602
and he did that test

33:59.670 --> 34:03.071
where they use needles
to prick a grid on your back

34:03.307 --> 34:05.571
with different toxins on them, you know,

34:05.643 --> 34:07.873
to see which ones you're allergic to.

34:07.945 --> 34:10.914
Next day I come in,
the doctor lifts up my shirt,

34:10.982 --> 34:12.847
and my back is a patch of oily, moldy,

34:12.917 --> 34:15.681
blackish-green double-puff marshmallows.

34:16.487 --> 34:18.819
I was allergic to everything.

34:19.956 --> 34:22.152
So they sealed the house with plastic

34:22.226 --> 34:24.353
and a special ventilation system,

34:24.429 --> 34:28.058
and I spent the rest of my childhood
and adolescence indoors.

34:28.132 --> 34:29.565
Alone.

34:30.601 --> 34:31.829
Lonely.

34:32.670 --> 34:34.570
- Wow.
- It wasn't till I was 19

34:34.639 --> 34:39.804
they discovered what I was
actually allergic to was the aluminum alloy

34:39.877 --> 34:42.641
the hypodermic needles were made out of.

34:44.248 --> 34:46.341
Then I was gonna leave,

34:47.351 --> 34:49.978
but my mom got sick. So I stayed.

34:51.089 --> 34:53.956
She stayed sick a really long time.

34:54.992 --> 34:56.391
Do you...

34:58.329 --> 34:59.819
Feel cheated?

35:00.364 --> 35:04.198
The trick to not feeling cheated
is to learn how to cheat.

35:04.635 --> 35:06.068
So,

35:06.537 --> 35:10.439
I decided this wasn't a story
about a miserable girl

35:10.508 --> 35:13.944
trapped in a house that
smelled like medical supplies,

35:14.278 --> 35:18.908
wasting her life on a dying person
she sometimes hated. No.

35:20.051 --> 35:25.614
This was a story about a girl who could find
infinite beauty in anything,

35:26.557 --> 35:28.184
any little thing.

35:29.026 --> 35:32.018
And even love the person
she was trapped with.

35:33.264 --> 35:36.529
And I told myself this story
until it became true.

35:38.870 --> 35:43.705
Now, did doing this help me
escape a wasted life,

35:43.774 --> 35:48.108
or did it blind me
so I wouldn't want to escape it?

35:48.179 --> 35:51.273
I don't know. But either way,

35:51.349 --> 35:54.147
I was the one telling my own story, so...

35:55.253 --> 35:58.711
No, I don't feel cheated at all.

36:12.336 --> 36:14.668
I don't suppose in all your hobby-acquiring,

36:14.739 --> 36:16.969
you ever learned how to dance?

36:17.308 --> 36:21.404
I went through a phase when I was mildly
obsessed with the bolero.

36:21.979 --> 36:23.503
Give me a minute.

37:01.586 --> 37:05.920
It's a long time since I last encountered
the brothers Bloom.

37:08.159 --> 37:09.956
Are you in antiques?

37:14.599 --> 37:15.896
Antique?

37:17.001 --> 37:21.495
I wonder, my dear, if you know
the true nature of the men you travel with.

37:29.213 --> 37:31.841
A little fear might suit you, I think.

37:50.534 --> 37:53.833
It isn't a Spanish band,
but they'll do their best.

38:43.554 --> 38:44.543
Mmm...

38:57.902 --> 39:00.871
And then... This is the really important part.

39:00.938 --> 39:02.701
You have to make a little,
itty-bitty, little hole.

39:11.816 --> 39:14.512
The ship's too small for us
to be dancing around each other.

39:14.585 --> 39:17.076
We might as well have this out now.

39:17.521 --> 39:19.955
Penelope, do you know our friend?

39:20.658 --> 39:22.523
Only as the creepy Frenchman.

39:22.593 --> 39:24.925
Book-learned. You know your languages

39:24.995 --> 39:26.553
but not your accents, <i>mademoiselle.</i>

39:26.630 --> 39:29.064
- No, I am Belgian.
- Ah.

39:29.500 --> 39:32.162
Maximilian Melville, at your service.

39:32.236 --> 39:35.899
Also known in certain professional circles
as The Curator.

39:35.973 --> 39:38.703
Pleased to make your acquaintance.
What do you do?

39:38.776 --> 39:43.770
I am a curator, presently at
the National <i>Musée</i> in Prague.

39:43.848 --> 39:45.475
Yeah. And yourself?

39:45.549 --> 39:47.210
I'm an epileptic photographer.

39:48.085 --> 39:51.612
Good for you. And you boys?
What do you do?

39:51.689 --> 39:54.453
We run a legitimate
antique reselling business.

39:54.525 --> 39:55.514
Ah.

39:59.397 --> 40:01.024
We've gone straight, Max.

40:01.098 --> 40:05.626
<i>Pardon,</i> but why would you ascend to
the great heights of the brothers Bloom

40:05.703 --> 40:08.399
just to toss it away, huh? To do what?

40:09.140 --> 40:13.304
To sell terra cotta
to blue-haired weekend antiquers?

40:13.377 --> 40:16.278
- I don't think so.
- We did. Eat your waffles.

40:17.681 --> 40:21.481
You know, the <i>mademoiselle,</i>
she seems a little confused.

40:21.552 --> 40:23.042
Maybe she is unawares?

40:23.120 --> 40:24.644
Eat your waffles, fat man.

40:25.790 --> 40:28.588
Unawares that the brothers Bloom, in fact,

40:29.994 --> 40:32.861
are the two most respected

40:34.198 --> 40:37.167
smugglers of antiques in the Western world.

40:37.768 --> 40:41.795
Were. We've been on
the straight for three years. So that's that.

40:41.872 --> 40:45.968
Oh, oh. Well, if that is that,
then that indeed is that. If you say so.

40:47.378 --> 40:48.367
Oh.

40:50.014 --> 40:52.482
- Your name's Melville.
<i>- Oui, vrai.</i>

40:53.317 --> 40:54.511
Right.

40:55.586 --> 40:59.386
No, sorry, um,
'cause I noticed before but I couldn't place it.

40:59.457 --> 41:01.049
This ship is called the <i>Fidele,</i>

41:01.125 --> 41:06.188
which is the name of the ship
in Melville's novel, <i>The Confidence-Man.</i>

41:07.198 --> 41:09.428
- So that's weird.
<i>- Oui.</i>

41:14.505 --> 41:16.700
I have never read that.

41:22.112 --> 41:26.242
Smugglers. It's like an adventure story.

41:27.485 --> 41:29.953
Whose idea was it to go straight?

41:30.287 --> 41:33.688
Mine. Stephen always loved the life.

41:34.291 --> 41:38.022
Then he was almost killed
on a run to Jakarta.

41:38.896 --> 41:41.626
These two thugs
with heads like canned hams

41:41.699 --> 41:43.530
worked him beyond all reason.

41:43.601 --> 41:46.297
Have at me, you ham-headed bastard!

41:47.404 --> 41:48.428
Shit!

41:48.639 --> 41:52.006
Sometimes I think he'd love to die on a job.

41:52.576 --> 41:55.409
Cornered at midnight on a run to Jakarta.

41:56.380 --> 41:58.211
That's his dream,

41:58.716 --> 42:01.549
to tell a story so well it fulfills itself.

42:03.220 --> 42:04.482
Somehow.

42:06.223 --> 42:08.987
It would finally make it real for him.

42:09.493 --> 42:12.121
That's kind of the thing we all want.

42:14.999 --> 42:19.993
Well, trying to get something real by telling
yourself stories is a trap.

42:21.105 --> 42:22.868
Trust me on that one.

42:36.353 --> 42:38.685
She's different. She knows...

42:40.190 --> 42:43.284
Sometimes I feel like she knows everything.

42:43.594 --> 42:45.528
Doesn't that worry you?

42:45.930 --> 42:49.229
No, but something about her
is worrying you plenty.

42:50.267 --> 42:52.895
She feels like one of your characters.

42:59.510 --> 43:02.343
The day I con you is the day I die, Bloom.

43:05.182 --> 43:08.083
How'd you get the Belgian on our budget?

43:08.385 --> 43:10.285
He's beautiful, right?

43:10.487 --> 43:12.387
I didn't expect him to actually be Belgian.

43:12.456 --> 43:14.947
I'm not sure he is. I'm off to bed.

43:16.694 --> 43:17.786
Hey.

43:19.563 --> 43:21.997
The only real danger in this whole play

43:22.132 --> 43:24.600
is that you actually fall in love with her.

43:24.668 --> 43:26.295
Hey, look at me.

43:27.004 --> 43:29.564
Mexico is closer than you think.

43:30.240 --> 43:32.731
Don't fall in love with her, Bloom.

43:46.991 --> 43:49.892
Good luck, boys, with the antiquing, huh.

44:06.977 --> 44:08.444
My French is a little rusty,

44:08.512 --> 44:12.107
but I believe he said,
"My proposition stands."

44:12.182 --> 44:14.650
He came out of nowhere last night.

44:14.918 --> 44:17.386
<i>Mademoiselle,</i> I will make you a proposition.

44:17.454 --> 44:19.115
Oh, Lord. What has he got?

44:19.189 --> 44:21.157
An 8th-century prayer book.

44:21.225 --> 44:23.523
He steals pieces from his museum in Prague,

44:23.594 --> 44:25.585
<i>and sells them off through smugglers.</i>

44:25.663 --> 44:26.755
That's what he does.

44:26.830 --> 44:28.161
I wonder who's his fence?

44:28.298 --> 44:29.629
It's probably his Spanish guy, right?

44:29.700 --> 44:30.689
Did he say who's buying?

44:30.768 --> 44:34.226
Yeah, an Argentinean. Argentine? Argent...

44:34.304 --> 44:36.602
A gentleman from the Argentine.

44:36.907 --> 44:41.844
So, The Curator will sell it to a middleman
for $1 million US,

44:41.979 --> 44:46.439
and then the Argentine...
The guy from South America,

44:46.517 --> 44:49.281
he will pay $2.5.

44:50.954 --> 44:52.478
It's not bad.

44:53.057 --> 44:55.787
I'm sorry you had to deal with that guy.

44:57.027 --> 44:58.551
Where's that cab going?

44:59.196 --> 45:00.720
Train station.

45:01.365 --> 45:02.423
Where's the train going?

45:02.499 --> 45:03.659
Prague.

45:05.836 --> 45:09.237
Come on! Let's be smugglers.

45:09.306 --> 45:11.831
I mean, I think it'd be fun. We should do this.

45:11.909 --> 45:13.809
- No.
- Why not?

45:14.178 --> 45:16.169
Well, first off, we don't have $1 million.

45:17.281 --> 45:18.976
That's like, I've got, what... That's whatever.

45:19.049 --> 45:20.607
I mean, give me a real reason.

45:20.684 --> 45:22.549
This is real. It's dangerous.

45:24.455 --> 45:26.821
- This could go very bad.
- Hmm.

45:27.391 --> 45:30.360
Well, I think
a little real danger might suit me,

45:30.427 --> 45:33.055
so, if you three want to join
my smugglers gang,

45:33.130 --> 45:35.655
I'II, you know, consider it.

45:38.135 --> 45:40.399
This isn't an adventure story.

45:40.604 --> 45:43.368
What are you talking about?

45:43.474 --> 45:45.442
Well, it totally is!

45:59.123 --> 46:02.115
Go, go, go. Go, go.

46:02.192 --> 46:03.386
You there, come back here!

46:04.428 --> 46:06.055
This is not for free.

46:15.739 --> 46:16.763
Wait up. Where are you?

46:16.840 --> 46:18.808
Come here. Come here.

46:21.879 --> 46:23.540
We're smuggling.

46:26.150 --> 46:27.913
From the snack car.

46:31.054 --> 46:33.614
She's making a flag
for our smugglers gang, man.

46:33.690 --> 46:36.750
This afternoon,
when she was writing in the observation car,

46:36.827 --> 46:38.988
I thought she was writing a letter, a journal.

46:39.062 --> 46:41.496
No. Come on, she's getting way too into this.

46:42.666 --> 46:45.897
It's not funny. I don't like this Prague con
you've cooked up, either.

46:46.403 --> 46:47.597
You're just leaving too much to chance.

46:47.671 --> 46:48.831
Listen, the whole point of this

46:48.906 --> 46:50.533
was to sweep her off her feet.

46:50.607 --> 46:52.370
So why don't you let her enjoy it?

46:52.442 --> 46:54.000
While it lasts?

47:03.720 --> 47:05.813
This came through just now?

47:06.990 --> 47:09.185
"Dear Stephen. Stop. Word on the wire is..."

47:09.259 --> 47:12.023
<i>"...The brothers B.</i>
<i>are bound for Prague.</i>

47:12.095 --> 47:13.585
<i>"I'm heading there myself.</i>

47:13.664 --> 47:17.828
<i>"Would love to see my boys.</i>
<i>Affectionately, D. D."</i>

47:17.901 --> 47:21.359
Our old Fagin is back. The Diamond Dog.

47:22.239 --> 47:23.729
Wire him back for me.

47:23.807 --> 47:25.536
Dear Dog. Stop.

47:25.609 --> 47:28.737
Unless you feel an excess of eyeballs
left in your skull,

47:28.812 --> 47:32.771
I highly suggest you stay far away from
me and my brother. Stop.

47:33.350 --> 47:36.513
Affectionately... Et cetera.

47:48.565 --> 47:50.863
You've taken this train before?

47:51.635 --> 47:52.727
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

47:53.470 --> 47:56.405
So this is all just like, "Whatever" to you.

47:56.473 --> 47:58.805
Well, I mean, usually, I'd just, you know,

47:58.876 --> 48:01.367
play cards and drink with Bang Bang
in the snack car.

48:01.445 --> 48:02.742
Bang who?

48:04.982 --> 48:06.506
Yueng Ling.

48:06.583 --> 48:09.017
- Bang Bang's her smuggler nickname.
- Ah.

48:09.953 --> 48:11.580
So how about me?

48:12.055 --> 48:13.283
Do I get a smuggler nickname?

48:13.357 --> 48:14.517
No.

48:21.865 --> 48:24.060
I think you're constipated.

48:25.369 --> 48:27.166
In your fucking soul.

48:32.576 --> 48:33.907
I think

48:34.378 --> 48:39.748
you might have a really big load of grumpy,
petrified poop up your soul's ass.

48:40.050 --> 48:42.746
- What?
- Bloom, I know

48:43.020 --> 48:45.352
I'm pretending to be a smuggler.

48:47.124 --> 48:48.455
Right?

48:48.692 --> 48:51.160
But what you don't know is,

48:52.362 --> 48:56.162
I am a full-on smuggler.

48:57.668 --> 49:00.000
'Cause I tell it like I own it.

49:00.604 --> 49:05.667
You know what your problem is?
You just got to stop thinking so much.

49:06.176 --> 49:08.838
I mean, just enjoy the ride, man.

49:09.413 --> 49:10.675
I mean...

49:20.023 --> 49:22.617
I love thunderstorms.

49:54.157 --> 49:56.751
Oh, my God. I'm just so horny.

49:56.827 --> 49:58.522
Goodnight.

50:10.974 --> 50:12.805
Here's the big two.

50:22.352 --> 50:25.219
Last time I was in Prague, I was in love.

50:25.389 --> 50:27.084
What was she like?

50:28.658 --> 50:30.888
Pale skin, long feet.

50:32.696 --> 50:33.924
So...

50:35.799 --> 50:37.494
And that's mine.

50:39.736 --> 50:42.000
Bloom and I will secure lodging.

50:44.908 --> 50:48.071
Miss Yueng Ling will scout out the museum.

50:48.712 --> 50:50.077
You will go to the bank.

50:50.147 --> 50:52.843
That wire should have cleared
if you put it in at Athens.

50:52.916 --> 50:55.282
- Cash?
- No.

50:55.952 --> 50:59.820
Only movie thugs and Russians
deal in suitcases of cash.

50:59.890 --> 51:02.051
You're gonna get a certified check.

51:08.131 --> 51:10.793
Who the hell is that?
Who is it?

51:11.034 --> 51:12.763
A Candy-gram.

51:12.903 --> 51:14.666
Max, it's us, for Christ's sake.

51:15.772 --> 51:16.761
Whoa!

51:21.278 --> 51:23.473
- Max! Max, it's us, Bloom.
- Max! It's Stephen and Bloom.

51:23.547 --> 51:25.447
- Jesus, Max, easy...
- Jesus, whoa!

51:25.515 --> 51:26.914
Whoa, now!

51:27.050 --> 51:28.449
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good morning.

51:29.586 --> 51:32.248
Come in. I have been drinking, you know.

51:35.459 --> 51:36.448
So,

51:40.130 --> 51:44.931
beside the basilica,
there are the offices of administration.

51:47.404 --> 51:50.771
And underneath them,
and otherwise totally inaccessible,

51:50.841 --> 51:53.309
there's a little section of catacombs.

51:53.376 --> 51:56.243
And of course, the book.

51:57.280 --> 51:59.680
But I am the curator, so I just walk in

51:59.749 --> 52:02.115
and I pinch the copy girl's <i>babouche.</i>

52:02.252 --> 52:05.688
I slip the book into my briefcase, and I leave.

52:07.524 --> 52:10.584
About 2:00 tomorrow, say?

52:17.667 --> 52:19.567
It is you who I do business with, <i>oui?</i>

52:20.704 --> 52:22.137
Right.

52:24.040 --> 52:27.134
Oh, right.

52:30.814 --> 52:33.146
Your smile is the sun, <i>ma chère.</i>

52:35.385 --> 52:38.718
And fallen men, we need the sun.

54:16.332 --> 54:20.098
Diamond Dog, carrying a cup and a cane.

54:21.971 --> 54:23.404
Bloom.

54:24.841 --> 54:27.207
Bloom, Bloom, Bloom.

54:30.179 --> 54:31.976
How long has it been?

54:33.082 --> 54:34.071
Mmm?

54:34.584 --> 54:36.051
Tea.

54:37.053 --> 54:39.954
Can you believe it? Tea.

54:41.624 --> 54:43.091
Been a long time, huh?

54:43.159 --> 54:45.184
If I call Stephen down here, he'll kill you.

54:45.261 --> 54:49.095
You're terrified, huh? Don't be scared.

54:49.866 --> 54:51.390
I'm an old man

54:53.369 --> 54:55.929
with no depth perception.

54:56.005 --> 54:58.473
You don't have to be scared of me.

55:01.944 --> 55:03.935
You know, it's been a funny thing,

55:04.013 --> 55:09.178
watching you boys take
what I taught you and eclipse me.

55:09.552 --> 55:11.349
I am so proud

55:11.921 --> 55:16.688
to be a footnote
in the life of the brothers Bloom.

55:16.759 --> 55:17.919
But you

55:19.729 --> 55:21.424
hate me.

55:25.535 --> 55:30.302
You probably won't believe,
but I loved you both very much.

55:31.274 --> 55:33.003
But love...

55:35.878 --> 55:38.176
You know, folks like us,

55:38.247 --> 55:42.149
you can always
blink and realize that it's a fiction.

55:43.252 --> 55:47.382
And like Peter walking on water
or Wile E. Coyote running off a cliff,

55:47.457 --> 55:50.187
if you look down in doubt,

55:51.294 --> 55:53.285
you will fall.

55:55.398 --> 56:00.631
That's the price of our lives,
the wax in our wings.

56:02.104 --> 56:04.664
One day, Stephen's going to fall.

56:05.408 --> 56:09.310
It may be glorious,
but he's going to fall hard,

56:09.378 --> 56:13.246
and he won't be there to tell you what to do,
to protect you.

56:13.483 --> 56:16.884
And without him, what would you do?

56:17.320 --> 56:20.619
I remember all the other boys
when I went for the belt.

56:20.690 --> 56:24.524
They would run. They would fight.
But not you.

56:24.594 --> 56:28.155
You were so passive, paralyzed.

56:28.831 --> 56:33.825
This is a warning, Bloom, and an offer.

56:34.170 --> 56:35.762
When he's gone,

56:36.806 --> 56:38.603
remember me.

56:44.080 --> 56:45.104
Oh!

56:45.181 --> 56:46.478
Stephen.

56:47.316 --> 56:49.580
We were just talking about you.

56:52.755 --> 56:54.052
Fuck you!

57:26.589 --> 57:28.682
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

57:29.325 --> 57:31.384
You can't always be there.

57:33.763 --> 57:35.628
Yeah, I guess I can't.

57:56.419 --> 57:57.579
Max!

58:02.592 --> 58:04.287
Aren't we a little early?

58:10.533 --> 58:12.899
Well, he's gone, that's for sure.

58:13.636 --> 58:15.763
Probably halfway around the world by now.

58:15.838 --> 58:18.033
Aren't you a wee bit early...

58:18.107 --> 58:20.132
I don't get it.

58:20.209 --> 58:22.336
If he was hightailing it,
why didn't he just wait eight hours

58:22.411 --> 58:24.709
until we traded the book for the million,

58:24.847 --> 58:27.145
then he'd a had some walking-around money.

58:29.518 --> 58:32.214
Oh, well, back to antiquing.

58:33.122 --> 58:34.817
Nothing lost, nothing gained.

58:34.890 --> 58:35.879
Oh.

58:41.197 --> 58:42.858
"Oh?"

58:47.603 --> 58:50.094
The check was cashed yesterday afternoon.

58:50.172 --> 58:53.403
He would have deposited it
in a Swiss account by now.

58:53.476 --> 58:55.603
I'm sorry, Pen. I'm sorry.

58:56.345 --> 58:57.812
Such a waste.

59:00.282 --> 59:04.150
Poor man. Poor Argentina man.

59:05.554 --> 59:08.318
I mean, he's never gonna
even see that book now.

59:08.391 --> 59:12.054
It's just gonna rot away in those catacombs.

59:15.598 --> 59:16.758
No.

59:16.832 --> 59:18.629
There is no book, all right.
We've been swindled.

59:18.701 --> 59:21.101
Well, maybe there is. Maybe it's real.

59:21.170 --> 59:24.537
- It's not real, it's a con.
- No.

59:24.740 --> 59:27.971
You know what? It's my money,
so I'm going to find out for sure.

59:28.044 --> 59:30.569
He gave us every piece
of information we need.

59:30.646 --> 59:33.638
Well, we'd have to clear
the administrative offices.

59:33.716 --> 59:35.513
Some sort of...

59:40.189 --> 59:41.622
Disruption.

59:52.234 --> 59:55.931
She's an artist with nitroglycerin.
It's kind of her thing.

59:56.005 --> 59:58.530
I feel like I want to know more about her.

59:58.607 --> 59:59.665
Yeah.

01:00:02.044 --> 01:00:06.276
<i>A few years back,</i>
<i>when we hit the top of our smuggling game,</i>

01:00:06.615 --> 01:00:08.446
<i>she just appeared.</i>

01:00:08.718 --> 01:00:12.085
<i>And we figure someday she'll just disappear.</i>

01:00:12.421 --> 01:00:15.015
Check out the tat on the back of her neck.

01:00:15.091 --> 01:00:17.958
It's an inky wisp of personal information.

01:00:18.527 --> 01:00:19.960
Essentially, it means,

01:00:20.029 --> 01:00:23.465
"When you're done with something,
blow it up."

01:00:33.943 --> 01:00:37.106
The smoke detector is in
these empty rooms in the east tower.

01:00:37.179 --> 01:00:39.409
We're gonna plant and set off a tiny, tiny...

01:00:41.450 --> 01:00:42.883
Tiny charge.

01:00:45.321 --> 01:00:48.757
A puff of smoke
sets off the fire alarm in the rafters.

01:00:48.824 --> 01:00:51.224
Fire drill ensues, offices empty.

01:00:51.293 --> 01:00:52.760
Excuse me.

01:00:52.962 --> 01:00:54.486
You have exactly four and a half minutes

01:00:54.563 --> 01:00:57.396
to get through the access hatch,
into the catacombs,

01:00:57.466 --> 01:01:01.027
grab the book and get out
before the fire brigade arrives.

01:01:01.103 --> 01:01:05.062
The abort code, in case we have to abort,
is "corned beef."

01:01:06.175 --> 01:01:07.802
For some reason.

01:01:07.877 --> 01:01:10.402
Okay,
so she blows this one up.

01:01:10.479 --> 01:01:12.344
This is Yueng Ling's backpack?

01:01:12.414 --> 01:01:13.711
Yeah.

01:01:16.385 --> 01:01:18.148
You know what I feel?

01:01:19.355 --> 01:01:20.788
Horny?

01:01:21.190 --> 01:01:22.623
Scared.

01:01:23.159 --> 01:01:26.390
And all my big talk, showing off all the time.

01:01:26.529 --> 01:01:29.464
But, I mean, this isn't a story,

01:01:30.499 --> 01:01:31.864
it's real.

01:01:33.536 --> 01:01:35.197
It's freaky scary.

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:40.840
Well, as long as you focus on,

01:01:40.910 --> 01:01:43.242
you know, second left, third right.

01:03:32.721 --> 01:03:33.745
Okay.

01:03:42.197 --> 01:03:43.255
All right?

01:03:44.833 --> 01:03:45.857
Okay.

01:03:55.945 --> 01:03:58.470
You know, for the record,
I'm still against this.

01:03:58.547 --> 01:03:59.878
Why send her in alone?

01:03:59.949 --> 01:04:03.350
Because going in alone
is a very important thing to do.

01:04:04.019 --> 01:04:09.321
Listen, she's walking into
a tourism office during a fire drill

01:04:09.391 --> 01:04:13.452
and taking a phony manuscript
from a lousy crawlspace.

01:04:13.629 --> 01:04:16.962
Worst-case scenario,
a file clerk asks her if she's lost,

01:04:17.032 --> 01:04:19.125
which isn't even gonna happen.

01:04:22.838 --> 01:04:24.806
Okay, she's in position.

01:04:27.643 --> 01:04:30.908
Because no one's gonna
even know we were ever here.

01:04:44.727 --> 01:04:46.092
Fuck me.

01:04:58.741 --> 01:05:01.642
Come on, don't do it. Don't, don't, don't...

01:05:15.791 --> 01:05:18.954
Abort! Corned beef, corned beef!

01:07:04.099 --> 01:07:07.193
Wait, wait. We're fine. We're fine. She's fine.

01:07:07.669 --> 01:07:09.637
Listen,
if the soldiers find her wandering the halls

01:07:09.705 --> 01:07:13.232
they'll assume she's a clerk.
They'll just shoo her out.

01:07:13.442 --> 01:07:17.276
So as long as she doesn't
do anything suspicious, she's fine.

01:08:29.651 --> 01:08:31.118
Oh, no.

01:08:31.252 --> 01:08:32.720
It's the chief of police.

01:08:33.921 --> 01:08:35.787
The chief of police!

01:08:45.334 --> 01:08:46.528
Thank you.

01:09:37.252 --> 01:09:39.243
I have, at different points in my life,

01:09:39.321 --> 01:09:43.256
quite literally sold ice to an Eskimo
and sand to an Arab.

01:09:43.325 --> 01:09:46.158
But I have no idea
what she could have said to that man

01:09:46.228 --> 01:09:49.197
to have sweet-talked her way
out of that castle.

01:09:49.264 --> 01:09:50.890
I could ask her.

01:09:50.966 --> 01:09:52.763
How obtuse.

01:09:54.970 --> 01:09:57.996
Let her sleep. Train doesn't leave until 8:00.

01:10:03.312 --> 01:10:04.802
That was real.

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:06.211
Yeah, I know.

01:10:08.183 --> 01:10:09.207
Huh...

01:10:09.284 --> 01:10:11.149
Freaky scary.

01:10:13.088 --> 01:10:14.612
<i>Miles from nowhere</i>

01:10:15.157 --> 01:10:17.751
<i>Guess I'll take my time</i>

01:10:19.027 --> 01:10:21.154
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

01:10:22.664 --> 01:10:24.894
<i>To reach there</i>

01:10:26.301 --> 01:10:29.031
<i>Look up at the mountain</i>

01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:33.599
<i>I have to climb</i>

01:10:33.675 --> 01:10:35.939
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

01:10:36.778 --> 01:10:39.406
<i>To reach there</i>

01:10:40.549 --> 01:10:43.017
<i>Lord, my body</i>

01:10:44.019 --> 01:10:46.647
<i>It's been a good friend</i>

01:10:47.422 --> 01:10:49.947
<i>I won't need it</i>

01:10:50.625 --> 01:10:52.991
<i>When I reach the end</i>

01:10:54.162 --> 01:10:56.653
<i>Miles from nowhere</i>

01:10:57.165 --> 01:11:00.157
<i>Guess I'll take my time</i>

01:11:00.836 --> 01:11:03.964
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:07.107
<i>To reach there</i>

01:11:13.081 --> 01:11:15.572
<i>I creep through the valleys</i>

01:11:15.917 --> 01:11:18.385
<i>And I grope through the woods</i>

01:11:18.954 --> 01:11:21.980
<i>'Cause I know when I find it, my honey</i>

01:11:22.057 --> 01:11:25.754
<i>It's gonna make me feel good, yes</i>

01:11:27.596 --> 01:11:28.927
An apple.

01:11:30.365 --> 01:11:33.163
Yeah, it was part of an epiphany.

01:11:34.102 --> 01:11:36.366
<i>I love everything</i>

01:11:36.638 --> 01:11:39.402
<i>So don't it make you feel sad</i>

01:11:39.474 --> 01:11:42.375
<i>'Cause I'll drink to you, my baby</i>

01:11:42.444 --> 01:11:47.575
<i>I'll think to that Yes, I'll think to that</i>

01:11:48.683 --> 01:11:50.412
<i>I'll think to that</i>

01:11:54.623 --> 01:11:56.682
<i>Miles from nowhere</i>

01:11:58.326 --> 01:12:01.193
<i>Guess I'll take my time</i>

01:12:03.999 --> 01:12:05.227
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

01:12:06.635 --> 01:12:08.762
<i>To reach there</i>

01:12:12.774 --> 01:12:14.264
Mexico.

01:12:17.245 --> 01:12:19.975
Okay, we're rendezvousing
with the Argentina guys here,

01:12:20.048 --> 01:12:23.449
on a isolated beach
just south of the Hotel Tampico.

01:12:23.518 --> 01:12:24.815
A simple handoff.

01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:27.445
Penelope, you and Yueng Ling
stay with the car,

01:12:27.522 --> 01:12:30.286
Bloom and I will be doing the handing.

01:12:30.358 --> 01:12:31.916
You guys seem a little tense.

01:12:32.661 --> 01:12:36.461
Well, I'm not thrilled they set this in Mexico.

01:12:37.232 --> 01:12:40.599
There could be legitimate reasons,
but Mexico's...

01:12:40.669 --> 01:12:43.467
And I don't like to simplistically vilify
an entire country,

01:12:43.538 --> 01:12:45.733
but Mexico's a horrible place.

01:12:48.043 --> 01:12:49.806
So we'll be careful.

01:13:06.495 --> 01:13:09.259
This is gonna be dangerous tomorrow, right?

01:13:09.764 --> 01:13:11.231
Yeah.

01:13:13.468 --> 01:13:15.129
You should sleep at the hotel tonight.

01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:16.965
I'll stay with Stephen at the beach house.

01:13:17.038 --> 01:13:18.903
But you'll need sleep.

01:13:21.243 --> 01:13:24.804
I'm really happy right now. Are you?

01:13:27.282 --> 01:13:29.113
Right now I am.

01:13:29.784 --> 01:13:35.188
<i>I wanna be a smuggler</i>
<i>smuggle by day, drink by night</i>

01:13:35.457 --> 01:13:37.652
<i>Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

01:14:02.984 --> 01:14:05.214
The last box in our last con.

01:14:06.354 --> 01:14:07.821
How's it feel?

01:14:30.445 --> 01:14:32.106
Hey, what's up?

01:14:38.253 --> 01:14:40.050
Bloom! What?

01:14:51.399 --> 01:14:53.663
My brother and I are con men.

01:14:55.770 --> 01:14:57.135
And...

01:14:58.773 --> 01:15:02.504
Everything since you hit me
with your Lamborghini,

01:15:03.578 --> 01:15:05.273
it's all fake, it's all

01:15:07.248 --> 01:15:08.545
a con.

01:15:14.089 --> 01:15:16.614
Stephen's gone into town
to prep the Argentina actors.

01:15:16.691 --> 01:15:17.749
Money's in his place.

01:15:17.826 --> 01:15:21.023
Money? I don't want the money, let's just go.

01:15:27.669 --> 01:15:29.660
Come on, come on.

01:15:38.313 --> 01:15:40.804
You have to
switch it on at the base.

01:15:54.963 --> 01:15:57.193
So, I told her our whole play.

01:15:58.833 --> 01:16:01.563
And I'm here to take her money back.

01:16:03.204 --> 01:16:05.331
How does that make you feel?

01:16:07.275 --> 01:16:08.640
Disappointed.

01:16:08.710 --> 01:16:10.507
This isn't the ending you wanted?

01:16:11.946 --> 01:16:15.575
What does that matter?
This is the way it ends now.

01:16:16.551 --> 01:16:19.247
So I might as well just get it over with.

01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:20.514
- Where's the money?
- I ate it.

01:16:20.588 --> 01:16:22.556
- Give me the money, Stephen.
- No.

01:16:22.624 --> 01:16:23.886
I don't want the money.

01:16:23.958 --> 01:16:26.119
He's not gonna keep a single piece of you.
Give me the money.

01:16:26.194 --> 01:16:29.391
I'm sorry you fell in love with her.
She's a mark.

01:16:29.564 --> 01:16:32.362
And all of this, all of it is just a con.

01:16:33.168 --> 01:16:34.499
And every moment you share with her,

01:16:34.569 --> 01:16:37.094
you're just playing the part
of a man falling in love.

01:16:37.172 --> 01:16:39.766
That's what you're afraid of, isn't it?

01:16:40.508 --> 01:16:42.567
That you don't know the difference.

01:16:42.644 --> 01:16:44.771
Or maybe that there really is no difference.

01:16:44.846 --> 01:16:46.780
That that's what love is, right?

01:16:46.848 --> 01:16:49.408
Okay, we're leaving.

01:16:49.651 --> 01:16:50.982
No.

01:16:51.686 --> 01:16:53.779
You're too scared to leave.

01:16:54.022 --> 01:16:56.286
You're too scared to ride off into the sunset,

01:16:56.357 --> 01:16:58.257
because real sunsets might be beautiful

01:16:58.326 --> 01:17:00.988
but they turn into dark, uncertain nights.

01:17:01.529 --> 01:17:05.829
No, you're not ready,
otherwise you wouldn't be here right now.

01:17:08.136 --> 01:17:10.866
The money is in my bedroom.
It's right behind me.

01:17:10.939 --> 01:17:15.035
But in my story you don't get the money
or the sunset or the girl.

01:17:18.046 --> 01:17:19.274
Bloom,

01:17:21.316 --> 01:17:22.874
let's just go.

01:17:24.385 --> 01:17:25.579
Please.

01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:33.454
Please?

01:18:10.365 --> 01:18:12.162
Tastes like tinfoil.

01:18:26.848 --> 01:18:28.281
I'm sorry.

01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:34.451
Shh. Shh. Shh.

01:18:39.194 --> 01:18:40.889
Get out of here.

01:18:42.630 --> 01:18:44.461
Take the car and go.

01:18:46.267 --> 01:18:48.167
I'm not going anywhere.

01:20:25.199 --> 01:20:31.069
<i>The storm is passed</i>
<i>There is peace at last</i>

01:20:31.673 --> 01:20:36.508
<i>I've spent my whole life sleeping</i>

01:20:37.512 --> 01:20:41.107
<i>Now there's not a sound</i>

01:20:41.182 --> 01:20:45.744
<i>No one to be found anywhere</i>

01:20:50.458 --> 01:20:56.260
<i>A shepherd and a sheep</i>
<i>will wind you to sleep</i>

01:20:56.965 --> 01:21:02.335
<i>Where else on earth would you rather go?</i>

01:21:03.237 --> 01:21:08.641
<i>To a land of wonder when you go under</i>

01:21:09.577 --> 01:21:12.011
<i>Why would we want</i>

01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:17.382
<i>to come back at all?</i>

01:21:45.046 --> 01:21:46.240
Hey.

01:21:48.349 --> 01:21:49.441
How'd you find me?

01:21:49.517 --> 01:21:50.541
Bang Bang.

01:21:50.618 --> 01:21:52.210
How'd you find Bang Bang?

01:21:52.286 --> 01:21:55.813
She gave me her number
when we were in Mexico. Her cell.

01:21:56.290 --> 01:21:57.621
Bang Bang has a cell phone?

01:21:57.692 --> 01:21:58.818
Yeah.

01:21:59.727 --> 01:22:03.629
I think she's kind of selective in
who she gives her number to.

01:22:09.704 --> 01:22:11.797
Why are you here, Penelope?

01:22:14.609 --> 01:22:15.837
Okay.

01:22:18.513 --> 01:22:21.914
Well, I...

01:22:24.585 --> 01:22:26.485
I've had a lot of time, you know,

01:22:26.554 --> 01:22:28.385
to think, these past three months

01:22:28.456 --> 01:22:34.292
and I want you to seriously consider this.

01:22:51.679 --> 01:22:53.010
Go away.

01:22:54.515 --> 01:22:55.880
Go away.

01:22:59.754 --> 01:23:01.813
Everything Stephen said was true.

01:23:01.956 --> 01:23:04.015
I was just playing you as a mark.

01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:08.085
Okay? Everything between us,

01:23:10.565 --> 01:23:12.294
none of it was real.

01:23:14.235 --> 01:23:15.532
Okay.

01:23:28.583 --> 01:23:30.244
I don't believe you.

01:23:57.812 --> 01:24:01.373
<i>I let you do your monologue,</i>
<i>but you wanna know why?</i>

01:24:02.583 --> 01:24:04.551
I let her believe everything you said,

01:24:04.619 --> 01:24:06.883
so she'd never want to see me again.

01:24:07.722 --> 01:24:10.316
Get her away from all this for good.

01:24:30.511 --> 01:24:34.572
- You wanna tell me what I'm doing here?
- You knew she'd come back.

01:24:35.449 --> 01:24:38.907
What did you figure she was good for,
another million?

01:24:38.986 --> 01:24:40.817
$1.75 million.

01:24:44.692 --> 01:24:46.887
Look, of course she came back.

01:24:47.562 --> 01:24:49.757
She never got what she wanted.

01:24:51.365 --> 01:24:52.354
Neither did you.

01:24:52.433 --> 01:24:54.560
All right, look, we're gonna end this.

01:24:54.635 --> 01:24:56.569
You built us into this,
you're gonna fly us out,

01:24:56.637 --> 01:24:58.662
you're gonna end it, so she's done with this.

01:24:58.739 --> 01:25:01.469
End it all so she can't start up again.

01:25:03.711 --> 01:25:06.179
Are you sure that's what you want?

01:25:07.582 --> 01:25:08.913
I love her.

01:25:12.987 --> 01:25:15.421
I don't want to turn her into me.

01:25:42.016 --> 01:25:43.608
Well, we can't do the next job

01:25:43.684 --> 01:25:46.016
until we liquidate our assets
from the last job.

01:25:46.087 --> 01:25:48.214
Uh-uh, you've got my million
from the last job, so...

01:25:48.289 --> 01:25:51.486
That's profit, not capital,
the three of us already split that up.

01:25:51.559 --> 01:25:55.655
So, step number one
is to sell the book of hours.

01:25:55.730 --> 01:25:57.095
Ah.

01:25:57.698 --> 01:26:01.156
The one that you told me was fake, right?

01:26:01.235 --> 01:26:03.533
Actually, with all your random expertise,

01:26:03.604 --> 01:26:05.834
we couldn't risk a flat-out fake.

01:26:06.407 --> 01:26:10.400
But to get top dollar,
we'll have to sell it deep black market.

01:26:11.345 --> 01:26:14.837
And there's only one place
that's deep enough for that.

01:26:15.449 --> 01:26:16.780
Where?

01:26:25.092 --> 01:26:27.253
- Who'd you get, anyway?
- Hmm?

01:26:27.328 --> 01:26:29.193
To play the Russians.

01:26:35.369 --> 01:26:36.927
My boys.

01:26:40.041 --> 01:26:41.406
I don't understand.

01:26:41.475 --> 01:26:45.138
We're sending Penelope off into the sunset,
that's what we're doing.

01:26:45.212 --> 01:26:46.338
Why is he here?

01:26:46.414 --> 01:26:50.043
We need someone to pass
for the Russian mob to sell our fake book to.

01:26:50.117 --> 01:26:51.982
The Dog has his big store right here
in Saint Petersburg.

01:26:52.053 --> 01:26:53.748
All right, stop.

01:26:54.388 --> 01:26:56.015
I hate him, Stephen.

01:26:56.657 --> 01:26:58.887
But this isn't that.

01:26:58.959 --> 01:27:00.119
This is I don't trust him.

01:27:00.194 --> 01:27:02.162
Yeah, what's he gonna do?

01:27:02.229 --> 01:27:04.720
Steal our fake money?

01:27:04.799 --> 01:27:06.733
I have thought this through, believe me.

01:27:06.801 --> 01:27:09.099
And we can't end it without him.

01:27:12.239 --> 01:27:15.572
Trust me. It's gonna be okay.

01:27:21.582 --> 01:27:24.813
Stephen,
still the grand architect.

01:27:24.885 --> 01:27:30.755
Your symbols, red for temptation,
white for salvation.

01:27:31.158 --> 01:27:35.561
And our hero must face the Minotaur
before he escapes the maze.

01:27:35.629 --> 01:27:36.618
Uh-huh.

01:27:37.031 --> 01:27:38.965
Pickup will be at your store.

01:27:39.033 --> 01:27:41.968
Scare her,
think a movie version of the Russian mob,

01:27:42.036 --> 01:27:44.129
but don't hassle the girl.

01:27:44.205 --> 01:27:46.799
The girl? What's her name?

01:27:46.874 --> 01:27:48.865
You don't need to know her name.

01:27:51.011 --> 01:27:53.206
I know it. Penelope.

01:27:54.181 --> 01:27:56.513
I look forward to meeting the lady.

01:27:57.818 --> 01:27:59.217
All right, here we go.

01:27:59.286 --> 01:28:01.880
We got the back windshield wired to explode,

01:28:01.956 --> 01:28:04.823
and there's a large charge
underneath the hood.

01:28:04.892 --> 01:28:08.259
After the handoff with the Dog,
we drive out of town.

01:28:08.329 --> 01:28:10.422
Late that night, we stop at a gas station

01:28:10.498 --> 01:28:12.796
where our fake Russians double-cross us,

01:28:12.933 --> 01:28:15.231
and kill us all in a moonlight ambush.

01:28:15.302 --> 01:28:19.329
We all die. Bloom takes a bullet
so Penelope can escape.

01:28:20.474 --> 01:28:21.736
The end.

01:28:23.411 --> 01:28:24.537
Okay.

01:28:29.250 --> 01:28:31.275
You've been awfully quiet.

01:28:37.124 --> 01:28:39.558
I'm doing this for her, you know.

01:28:52.606 --> 01:28:54.574
Tomorrow is the big day.

01:29:32.079 --> 01:29:33.603
Get down!

01:30:47.621 --> 01:30:49.589
- Out!
- Come on, come on.

01:30:49.957 --> 01:30:51.686
Get out, get out.

01:31:02.836 --> 01:31:05.168
Bloom! Bloom.

01:31:09.543 --> 01:31:10.635
What happened?

01:31:10.711 --> 01:31:11.735
You okay?

01:31:13.314 --> 01:31:15.748
What happened? Where's Stephen?

01:31:16.684 --> 01:31:18.276
Stephen?

01:31:18.519 --> 01:31:19.850
I think...

01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:22.411
Bloom, I think they might have got him,

01:31:22.489 --> 01:31:25.458
because I think they double-crossed us
or something,

01:31:25.526 --> 01:31:29.257
because, you know,
I think they got Stephen, but...

01:31:29.330 --> 01:31:30.888
- Stephen's notebook.
- They're gonna want money

01:31:30.965 --> 01:31:33.126
so then we can get him back.

01:31:34.501 --> 01:31:36.025
Who's got him?

01:31:36.704 --> 01:31:39.537
Why, I think the Russians got him, Bloom.

01:31:48.983 --> 01:31:51.679
Stephen, God, please, what's happening?

01:31:52.386 --> 01:31:54.752
I don't know what to do, Stephen.

01:32:01.195 --> 01:32:02.526
Shit!

01:32:10.337 --> 01:32:14.831
If you know what's happening,
now would be a really good time to speak up.

01:32:24.151 --> 01:32:28.520
Oh, please. Please, not now.
I need your help here.

01:32:28.589 --> 01:32:30.750
I don't know what to do.

01:32:57.284 --> 01:32:58.512
Thanks.

01:33:17.571 --> 01:33:18.833
I can't believe it.

01:33:18.906 --> 01:33:21.670
What, that Bang Bang fell for a car bomb?

01:33:22.142 --> 01:33:23.666
Neither can I.

01:33:24.778 --> 01:33:26.245
Oh, you mean...

01:33:27.247 --> 01:33:29.579
You think maybe she faked it

01:33:29.650 --> 01:33:32.414
to make the Russians think she was dead?

01:33:33.587 --> 01:33:36.715
Bloom, what do we do now?

01:33:43.664 --> 01:33:45.256
It's a ransom note.

01:33:45.332 --> 01:33:46.890
It says they have Stephen.

01:33:46.967 --> 01:33:50.562
It says they want the money
wired to a specific account.

01:33:50.637 --> 01:33:53.902
They give a bank to do it at,
a manager to ask for.

01:33:54.241 --> 01:33:56.971
Then an address to go to
at 2:00 p.m., in two hours.

01:33:57.044 --> 01:33:58.375
Okay.

01:33:58.445 --> 01:34:02.609
Well, I'll wire the money from my account,
and we'll go get Stephen.

01:34:02.850 --> 01:34:04.317
It's a lot.

01:34:04.685 --> 01:34:06.243
I'll do it. I want to. I've got...

01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:07.617
Well, how much are they asking for?

01:34:07.688 --> 01:34:09.451
$1.75 million.

01:34:10.357 --> 01:34:11.346
Oh.

01:34:16.463 --> 01:34:17.452
Oh...

01:34:26.340 --> 01:34:29.969
No! I'm gonna kill him.
I am gonna kill him if that's what this is.

01:34:30.043 --> 01:34:32.341
If that's all that this is, I will kill him.

01:34:32.412 --> 01:34:34.141
Kill who? What are you talking about?

01:34:34.281 --> 01:34:36.044
I will kill him. I will... No!

01:34:36.550 --> 01:34:37.778
What?

01:34:41.088 --> 01:34:45.525
I've been an idiot. This could all be a con
by my brother to get me to...

01:34:46.827 --> 01:34:50.695
Oh, God, he wanted me to end it,
and he gets your money.

01:34:50.764 --> 01:34:52.391
Oh, God, I'm gonna be sick.

01:34:52.466 --> 01:34:55.367
But would he do that? To you?

01:34:57.237 --> 01:34:58.932
I don't know.

01:35:00.340 --> 01:35:02.740
Yes. Yeah, of course he would.

01:35:03.110 --> 01:35:05.840
To tell a story so well it becomes real.

01:35:06.413 --> 01:35:09.109
The perfect con. That's his whole...

01:35:10.818 --> 01:35:12.342
God damn it, that's what.

01:35:12.419 --> 01:35:14.182
You know what? We don't know.

01:35:15.489 --> 01:35:17.548
- We better transfer the money.
- Son of a...

01:35:17.624 --> 01:35:19.615
It's your brother's life.

01:35:21.128 --> 01:35:23.119
I'm gonna wire the money.

01:35:30.904 --> 01:35:32.030
Okay.

01:35:39.546 --> 01:35:41.878
I'm coming in with you.

01:35:42.316 --> 01:35:43.806
No, stay here.

01:35:45.586 --> 01:35:48.646
Going in alone is a very
important thing to do.

01:35:53.427 --> 01:35:55.019
I'm so scared.

01:35:58.599 --> 01:36:02.091
Anything I can imagine
finding in there, I'm scared of.

01:36:04.104 --> 01:36:06.572
I'm gonna be here when you come out.

01:36:43.710 --> 01:36:45.075
Stephen?

01:36:51.785 --> 01:36:53.275
Stephen?

01:36:57.090 --> 01:36:59.456
Game's up. Come on out.

01:37:03.263 --> 01:37:05.925
Come on, let's blow this one-hat town.

01:37:41.835 --> 01:37:43.769
- Stephen!
- No, Bloom.

01:37:48.542 --> 01:37:50.134
Did Penelope wire the money?

01:37:50.644 --> 01:37:51.838
Yeah.

01:37:56.750 --> 01:37:59.014
Stephen, tell me what this is.

01:37:59.086 --> 01:38:01.418
Jesus Christ, Bloom, I'm sorry.

01:38:01.488 --> 01:38:04.150
I don't need sorry. I need the truth.

01:38:06.660 --> 01:38:09.185
God damn it, Stephen.
You tell me what to do.

01:38:09.262 --> 01:38:10.991
- Get the hell out of here now!
- Tell me the truth.

01:38:11.064 --> 01:38:13.328
Is this a con or is it real?

01:38:15.268 --> 01:38:16.860
A con?

01:38:18.972 --> 01:38:20.599
It's real, Bloom.

01:38:24.478 --> 01:38:26.139
<i>Hello, Bloom.</i>

01:38:26.213 --> 01:38:28.181
God damn it, Bloom.
It's real, this is not a con.

01:38:28.248 --> 01:38:31.581
<i>Are you happy to hear</i>
<i>from your old Diamond Dog?</i>

01:38:31.651 --> 01:38:35.280
These are the Dog's men.
He's crossed us for revenge.

01:38:35.589 --> 01:38:36.988
Damn it, Bloom, run!

01:38:37.057 --> 01:38:39.787
<i>I told you Stephen would fall.</i>

01:38:40.994 --> 01:38:44.054
<i>And you? You are paralyzed,</i>

01:38:44.698 --> 01:38:48.691
<i>praying this is just</i>
<i>another one of Stephen's stories.</i>

01:38:49.236 --> 01:38:50.703
<i>Is it?</i>

01:38:51.338 --> 01:38:54.398
<i>Close your eyes now, sweet child.</i>

01:38:55.442 --> 01:38:58.639
<i>And I will tell you the truth.</i>

01:39:02.315 --> 01:39:03.373
No!

01:39:15.462 --> 01:39:16.724
Bloom!

01:39:23.236 --> 01:39:24.999
He's got another gun!

01:39:51.731 --> 01:39:53.961
Please tell me that's makeup.

01:39:54.468 --> 01:39:56.060
Please tell me that's a cackle-bladder,

01:39:56.136 --> 01:39:57.694
and you just pulled off the perfect con.

01:39:57.771 --> 01:39:59.136
Please.

01:40:25.765 --> 01:40:27.699
You said it, not me.

01:40:31.438 --> 01:40:33.497
Can I get a "wow" for this?

01:40:36.143 --> 01:40:37.269
Wow.

01:40:39.779 --> 01:40:42.247
You son of a bitch.

01:40:52.959 --> 01:40:55.052
You did it. You're done here.

01:40:55.128 --> 01:40:59.462
I want you to promise me you'll never
come back to St. Petersburg again.

01:41:08.008 --> 01:41:09.771
Tastes like tinfoil.

01:41:10.644 --> 01:41:14.205
All right, here's what I want you to do.
Bang Bang split?

01:41:14.581 --> 01:41:16.071
Yeah. Clean exit.

01:41:16.149 --> 01:41:17.173
How?

01:41:17.350 --> 01:41:18.681
Car bomb.

01:41:18.752 --> 01:41:19.844
Good.

01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:22.111
- Penelope?
- She's outside.

01:41:22.189 --> 01:41:23.781
All right, here's what.

01:41:24.858 --> 01:41:27.986
<i>Take Penelope to Helsinki,</i>
<i>get that flight to Rio.</i>

01:41:28.061 --> 01:41:30.552
<i>Play out the whole</i>
<i>"on the run from vengeful Russians" thing,</i>

01:41:30.630 --> 01:41:33.155
<i>that'll be fun for her.</i>
<i>Play it like I'm dead, actually.</i>

01:41:33.233 --> 01:41:35.326
That'll add some gravity to everything.

01:41:35.402 --> 01:41:37.529
And I'll see you when I see you.

01:41:38.572 --> 01:41:41.268
- When?
- I don't know. Not too soon, I hope.

01:41:41.341 --> 01:41:44.003
Last thing you need is me hanging around.

01:41:44.077 --> 01:41:46.739
Anyway, how am I going to top this?

01:41:47.113 --> 01:41:48.375
Bloom,

01:41:49.783 --> 01:41:51.216
pick a card.

01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:55.379
- All right.
- Got it?

01:41:55.889 --> 01:41:57.220
Yeah.

01:42:04.998 --> 01:42:07.899
That's the best card trick I've ever seen.

01:42:09.836 --> 01:42:12.202
Wish you had a bigger audience.

01:42:12.639 --> 01:42:15.369
You're the only audience I ever needed.

01:42:26.753 --> 01:42:28.118
I love you.

01:42:31.157 --> 01:42:32.283
Bye.

01:42:40.634 --> 01:42:41.862
Shh. Shh. Shh.

01:42:41.935 --> 01:42:44.130
It's okay. It's okay.

01:45:04.244 --> 01:45:07.270
You know, he said this thing to me once.

01:45:09.916 --> 01:45:12.180
He said to me,

01:45:12.252 --> 01:45:15.949
"There's no such thing as an unwritten life.

01:45:18.591 --> 01:45:20.752
"Just a badly written one."

01:45:26.699 --> 01:45:28.132
Oh, God.

01:45:31.337 --> 01:45:33.134
I love you, Bloom.

01:45:38.678 --> 01:45:40.942
You know what we're gonna do?

01:45:45.985 --> 01:45:48.180
We're gonna live

01:45:49.422 --> 01:45:52.880
like we're telling the best story
in the whole world.

01:45:58.398 --> 01:46:00.127
Are you ready?

01:46:10.310 --> 01:46:12.938
<i>And Stephen said</i>
<i>something else, once.</i>

01:46:14.113 --> 01:46:16.604
<i>"The perfect con is one</i>
<i>where everyone involved</i>

01:46:16.683 --> 01:46:19.174
<i>"gets just the thing they wanted."</i>

01:46:26.226 --> 01:46:27.557
<i>Well...</i>

01:50:22.428 --> 01:50:24.555
<i>You came to me</i>

01:50:25.064 --> 01:50:30.001
<i>In the hospital ward when I blew out my knee</i>

01:50:31.137 --> 01:50:35.597
<i>But I wasn't there to be cared for or carried</i>

01:50:39.879 --> 01:50:42.780
<i>'Cause I was asleep</i>

01:50:42.849 --> 01:50:47.877
<i>In my bed, in my house</i>
<i>at the end of our street</i>

01:50:49.021 --> 01:50:53.549
<i>While you drove across town</i>
<i>at 3:00 in the morning</i>

01:50:56.362 --> 01:50:59.923
<i>It was fake</i>

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:04.197
<i>For the sake</i>

01:51:05.805 --> 01:51:09.366
<i>Of making you take me for real</i>

01:51:09.776 --> 01:51:16.443
<i>But I guess you're even less impressed</i>

01:51:24.123 --> 01:51:27.058
<i>If the world is a stage</i>

01:51:27.593 --> 01:51:32.758
<i>And we're all of us actors</i>
<i>in some cosmic play</i>

01:51:33.900 --> 01:51:38.894
<i>I am the man at the masquerade</i>

01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:44.237
<i>Who was fake</i>

01:51:45.711 --> 01:51:49.807
<i>For the sake</i>

01:51:50.716 --> 01:51:54.208
<i>Of making you take me for real</i>

01:51:54.754 --> 01:52:01.091
<i>But I guess you're even less impressed</i>

01:52:01.160 --> 01:52:07.827
<i>I keep trying to paint a picture</i>

01:52:09.836 --> 01:52:12.361
<i>'Cause what I drew</i>

01:52:14.240 --> 01:52:17.266
<i>Could be improved</i>

01:52:17.343 --> 01:52:20.870
<i>If I could make you see</i>

01:52:21.314 --> 01:52:26.616
<i>More flame than flicker</i>

01:52:27.086 --> 01:52:30.419
<i>These half-truths</i>

01:52:32.391 --> 01:52:36.657
<i>Could be improved</i>

01:52:36.729 --> 01:52:40.961
<i>With less of me</i>

01:52:44.503 --> 01:52:47.438
<i>And more you</i>

01:52:52.912 --> 01:52:55.972
<i>Believe what I speak</i>

01:53:04.257 --> 01:53:08.250
<i>At least just keep</i>

01:53:15.801 --> 01:53:19.259
<i>Speaking to me</i>

01:53:20.305 --> 01:53:26.426
