02:30.922 --> 02:34.221
The Nile was always there.

02:34.258 --> 02:38.194
Long before Cairo, long before
the tombs of kings...

02:38.229 --> 02:42.359
it was the reason
for everything.

02:42.400 --> 02:46.894
It's a little hard to grasp how
far this river's been flowing.

02:46.938 --> 02:49.463
This is the rain
that fell on Abyssinia.

02:49.507 --> 02:53.068
These are the waters drained
from central African lakes...

02:53.111 --> 02:58.481
that have flowed 4,000 miles
to make Egypt green.

03:00.585 --> 03:02.917
The Nile has its memories.

03:02.954 --> 03:06.947
The story of Khartoum
is a recent one...

03:06.991 --> 03:08.720
less than a century old.

03:08.760 --> 03:12.218
That's yesterday
in this part of the world.

03:12.263 --> 03:14.595
But however far back
you may go...

03:14.632 --> 03:19.365
all the Nile's recollections
have several things in common.

03:19.403 --> 03:22.099
There's always God,
for instance.

03:22.140 --> 03:25.371
Or, if you prefer, the gods.

03:25.409 --> 03:27.343
It seems to have been
quite impossible...

03:27.378 --> 03:28.936
to live beside this river...

03:28.980 --> 03:32.643
and not to have visions
of eternity.

03:32.683 --> 03:35.481
And there's always mystery.

03:35.520 --> 03:38.421
You never quite know.

03:38.456 --> 03:42.722
You wind up with a few questions
that no one can answer.

03:46.864 --> 03:48.331
One more thing.

03:48.366 --> 03:51.961
Why is it that everything
was always so big...

03:52.003 --> 03:54.528
outsized, larger-than-life?

03:54.572 --> 03:57.507
Vanity? Perhaps.

03:57.542 --> 04:00.136
Or visions.

04:00.178 --> 04:02.908
Vanity was always mixed up
with vision.

04:02.947 --> 04:05.313
And that's
part of this story, too.

04:07.051 --> 04:11.715
But it's the Nile
that remains the original fact.

04:11.756 --> 04:16.192
The Nile and, of course,
the desert.

04:18.396 --> 04:20.261
Move up, up the Nile.

04:20.298 --> 04:22.926
Leave Egypt behind
and the green land.

04:22.967 --> 04:24.662
Enter the Sudan.

04:24.702 --> 04:29.366
A million square miles
of desert and scrub.

04:29.407 --> 04:34.606
It was here out of the vast,
hot African nowhere...

04:34.645 --> 04:37.478
that a man of the Nile,
a man of vision...

04:37.515 --> 04:41.645
and mystery and vanity
rose up in the 1880s...

04:41.686 --> 04:45.087
to challenge first Egypt,
and then the world.

04:45.122 --> 04:49.422
He called himself the Mahdi,
the Expected One...

04:49.460 --> 04:53.294
and he gathered about him
his desert tribesmen...

04:53.331 --> 04:58.860
and he cried out for holy war.

04:58.903 --> 05:01.838
Egypt hired an army
of 10,000 men...

05:01.873 --> 05:04.364
and a professional English
soldier to command them...

05:04.408 --> 05:08.401
and sent them 1,600 miles
up the Nile to Khartoum...

05:08.446 --> 05:13.440
and on into the desert
to destroy this man, the Mahdi.

05:13.484 --> 05:18.080
Our history might have taken
a quite different turn...

05:18.122 --> 05:23.025
had Colonel William Hicks not
forgotten, if he ever knew...

05:23.060 --> 05:26.086
the Sudan's great fact...

05:26.130 --> 05:29.497
its immensity.

05:29.533 --> 05:34.163
The Mahdi led him on and on...
and on.

06:45.543 --> 06:48.341
- Keep those men back!
- Right you are! Keep order!

06:48.379 --> 06:50.108
Back!

07:55.646 --> 07:58.171
Bugler!

08:44.762 --> 08:46.957
Deploy!

09:33.043 --> 09:35.841
Get those rifles
to the high ground!

10:05.843 --> 10:08.812
Mahdi!

11:12.309 --> 11:16.575
Beloveds,
you're men of the desert.

11:16.614 --> 11:19.845
My Lord Mohammed, blessings
and peace be upon him...

11:19.883 --> 11:21.282
commands me to speak...

11:21.318 --> 11:25.982
for I am the Mahdi,
the Expected One...

11:26.023 --> 11:28.856
and I am sprung from
the forehead of the family...

11:28.892 --> 11:31.452
of my Lord Mohammed,
blessings be upon him.

11:31.495 --> 11:36.296
My beloveds,
did I not promise thee...

11:36.333 --> 11:39.791
a miracle would fall from heaven
from the Prophet Mohammed?

11:39.837 --> 11:42.897
And was not this so?

11:48.045 --> 11:51.344
We fight a holy war against
the fat and the corrupt...

11:51.382 --> 11:53.282
and the sinful
and the unbelieving.

11:53.317 --> 11:58.152
We fight a war to restore to a
disobedient, forgetful world...

11:58.188 --> 12:01.749
the laws and commands
of the Prophet Mohammed...

12:01.792 --> 12:04.386
blessings and peace
be upon him...

12:04.428 --> 12:09.229
whose instrument on Earth I am.

12:09.266 --> 12:15.136
Exalt ye not that men are dead,
since more must die tomorrow.

12:15.172 --> 12:19.802
My beloveds, in a vision...

12:19.843 --> 12:22.505
the Prophet Mohammed
has instructed me.

12:22.546 --> 12:26.915
Let mountain and desert tremble.

12:26.950 --> 12:30.579
Let cities shudder,
and let the fat and the rich...

12:30.621 --> 12:34.250
and the corrupt in far places
mark this moment...

12:34.291 --> 12:39.820
and turn in fear
of all those miracles to come!

12:39.863 --> 12:44.823
And let none in all Islam,
from this victorious hour...

12:44.868 --> 12:50.397
believe I am other
than the Expected One...

12:50.441 --> 12:52.636
the true Mahdi.

12:54.311 --> 12:57.906
Beloveds,
it is the hour of prayer.

13:10.494 --> 13:16.558
Explain to me, somebody, where
in heaven's name is Wolseley?

13:16.600 --> 13:19.160
Explain to me
how a rabble of tribesmen...

13:19.203 --> 13:21.137
armed only
with spears and swords...

13:21.171 --> 13:23.264
can destroy a modern army?

13:23.307 --> 13:24.535
Not a British army,
Prime Minister.

13:24.575 --> 13:26.042
- To the last man.
- An Egyptian army.

13:26.076 --> 13:27.703
I don't care whose army.

13:27.745 --> 13:31.875
10,000 men...
a British officer commanding.

13:31.915 --> 13:35.510
Why did Egypt have to hire
an Englishman?

13:35.552 --> 13:37.179
Colonel Hicks was a fool.

13:37.221 --> 13:39.086
Clearly. A fool.

13:39.123 --> 13:41.887
That's not the question.
Why did he have to be English?

13:41.925 --> 13:43.722
"Avenge Hicks."

13:43.761 --> 13:46.423
"Uphold Britain's Honor."

13:46.463 --> 13:50.263
Wolseley, I have the press
at my throat.

13:50.300 --> 13:53.064
I was summoned to Scotland
to explain to Her Majesty.

13:53.103 --> 13:54.263
Will you explain to me...

13:54.304 --> 13:56.670
Mr. Gladstone,
Colonel Stewart...

13:56.707 --> 13:59.232
recently attached
to military intelligence.

13:59.276 --> 14:00.641
The colonel's just back
from Khartoum.

14:00.677 --> 14:02.872
He will be able to explain
better than I.

14:02.913 --> 14:06.371
Colonel Stewart, sit down.

14:06.417 --> 14:09.909
Are these bulletins
from Khartoum true?

14:09.953 --> 14:12.251
It's over a month's travel
from the Sudan, sir...

14:12.289 --> 14:14.553
so, obviously, I left before
these events took place...

14:14.591 --> 14:15.751
but I assume they're true.

14:15.793 --> 14:16.987
Why?

14:17.027 --> 14:19.552
I was sent to Khartoum to
assess the Egyptian capacity...

14:19.596 --> 14:21.063
to deal with the uprising.

14:21.098 --> 14:22.565
I assessed it as nil.

14:22.599 --> 14:24.499
Military intelligence?

14:24.535 --> 14:26.196
There's intelligence for you.

14:26.236 --> 14:28.670
After the event,
they knew all about it.

14:28.705 --> 14:30.570
My reports were delivered
to Sir Evelyn Baring...

14:30.607 --> 14:32.006
in Cairo before the event.

14:32.042 --> 14:35.842
I was aware of the reports.
I just didn't believe them.

14:35.879 --> 14:37.244
- I'm Granville.
- My Lord.

14:37.281 --> 14:39.112
The reports still don't
explain to me, however...

14:39.149 --> 14:41.276
how a modern army
could be slaughtered...

14:41.318 --> 14:42.945
virtually to the last man.

14:42.986 --> 14:46.149
Colonel Hicks and his men, sir,
were fighting for wages.

14:46.190 --> 14:48.658
The Mahdi and his men
were fighting a holy war.

14:48.692 --> 14:50.922
Also, Hicks made
a very bad mistake.

14:50.961 --> 14:53.395
He thought he was fighting an
ignorant savage, and he wasn't.

14:53.430 --> 14:55.261
The Mahdi is
the most extraordinary man...

14:55.299 --> 14:56.891
the Sudan's ever seen.

14:56.934 --> 14:58.367
And he knows his people.

14:58.402 --> 15:00.802
He promised them a miracle.
He had to deliver it.

15:00.838 --> 15:04.535
Even so, Colonel Stewart,
the extent of the disaster...

15:04.575 --> 15:08.511
The disaster, sir, has little to
do with the loss of 10,000 men.

15:08.545 --> 15:09.944
It's their arms.

15:09.980 --> 15:12.813
Egypt was unequal to a horde
of desert tribesmen...

15:12.850 --> 15:15.011
when they'd scarcely a pistol
to call their own.

15:15.052 --> 15:16.314
What does he do now...

15:16.353 --> 15:19.186
now that they've captured
10,000 Remington rifles...

15:19.223 --> 15:20.656
five batteries of artillery...

15:20.691 --> 15:23.922
and very nearly five million
rounds of ammunition?

15:23.961 --> 15:26.725
And I must add
what will become of Egypt...

15:26.763 --> 15:30.324
if the Mahdi occupies Khartoum
and the Khartoum arsenal?

15:30.367 --> 15:33.063
What a jolly day you'll have
with Her Majesty tomorrow.

15:33.103 --> 15:35.196
Gentlemen,
let me make one thing clear.

15:35.239 --> 15:37.799
I'm sending no armies
up the Nile.

15:37.841 --> 15:39.741
You, Hartington,
your imperialist friends...

15:39.776 --> 15:43.712
you're looking for any excuse
to move into central Africa.

15:43.747 --> 15:45.044
We are discussing Egypt.

15:45.082 --> 15:47.346
We have a moral responsibility
to Egypt.

15:47.384 --> 15:49.249
A moral responsibility.

15:49.286 --> 15:51.914
We have the Suez Canal.
Say it.

15:51.955 --> 15:54.890
Egypt protects Suez.
We protect Egypt.

15:54.925 --> 15:57.758
Why in heaven's name
can't Egypt protect herself?

15:57.794 --> 15:59.762
We've just heard
from Colonel Stewart.

15:59.796 --> 16:00.990
She's not up to it.

16:01.031 --> 16:02.521
Colonel Stewart?

16:02.566 --> 16:04.625
I've no doubt
he's like the rest of you.

16:04.668 --> 16:06.499
He can see himself
leading a British army...

16:06.537 --> 16:10.701
1,600 miles up the Nile,
flags flying, glory for all.

16:10.741 --> 16:12.106
I beg your pardon, sir.

16:12.142 --> 16:13.700
Before I'd accept
such a command...

16:13.744 --> 16:15.211
I'd resign my commission.

16:15.245 --> 16:16.610
I wouldn't spend
one British life...

16:16.647 --> 16:18.239
to oppose the Mahdi,
not in the Sudan.

16:18.282 --> 16:20.546
I assumed you were
for intervention.

16:20.584 --> 16:23.109
You didn't ask my opinion, sir.

16:23.153 --> 16:26.554
Well, I want it, by heaven,
if it agrees with mine.

16:26.590 --> 16:27.852
Gentlemen, I shall suggest...

16:27.891 --> 16:29.483
to Her Majesty
in Scotland tomorrow...

16:29.526 --> 16:31.858
that we shall discharge
our obligations to Egypt...

16:31.895 --> 16:35.626
by evacuating all
the Egyptians from Khartoum.

16:35.666 --> 16:37.395
How, without either
a British army...

16:37.434 --> 16:39.061
or loss of British honor?

16:39.102 --> 16:43.539
I shall entertain suggestions
as to just how.

16:46.510 --> 16:47.875
Gordon.

16:51.014 --> 16:52.982
Chinese Gordon.

16:57.988 --> 17:00.354
What's Gordon doing now?

17:00.390 --> 17:02.221
He's made a contract with
the king of the Belgians...

17:02.259 --> 17:04.250
to take over the Congo
from Mr. Stanley.

17:04.294 --> 17:05.954
We can arrange that
with Brussels.

17:05.996 --> 17:08.089
Send Gordon to Khartoum.

17:08.131 --> 17:10.622
The man who led
the Chinese Emperor's armies...

17:10.666 --> 17:12.896
to victory after victory
carrying only a cane...

17:12.935 --> 17:14.164
send him to Khartoum.

17:14.204 --> 17:16.536
- Without an army?
- Gordon doesn't need an army.

17:16.573 --> 17:18.598
Yes, remember, without
a single British soldier...

17:18.642 --> 17:20.269
he ended slavery in the Sudan.

17:20.310 --> 17:22.540
He's a hero...
to the Sudanese...

17:22.579 --> 17:25.343
to the English,
to the anti-slavery people...

17:25.382 --> 17:27.474
to the churchmen.

17:27.517 --> 17:30.247
Send him to Khartoum,
and you'll be applauded...

17:30.287 --> 17:33.688
from Land's End to Inverness...

17:33.724 --> 17:35.851
and Her Majesty.

17:35.892 --> 17:37.223
Granville,
you're wasting my time.

17:37.260 --> 17:39.285
The man's a mystic.
He's an idealist...

17:39.329 --> 17:40.921
with ideals strictly his own.

17:40.964 --> 17:44.195
Give him an instruction,
he treats a military order...

17:44.234 --> 17:46.031
as if it were
a birthday greeting.

17:46.069 --> 17:48.970
Besides, I trust no man
who consults God...

17:49.006 --> 17:51.634
before he consults me.

17:51.675 --> 17:52.903
May I speak, sir?

17:52.943 --> 17:55.776
In my opinion,
General Gordon would refuse.

17:55.812 --> 17:58.406
After all,
when he went to the Sudan...

17:58.448 --> 18:00.382
as Governor General
and put down the slave trade...

18:00.417 --> 18:02.112
with nothing
but his own audacity...

18:02.152 --> 18:03.380
and a few loyal lieutenants...

18:03.420 --> 18:05.718
sir, he didn't face the Mahdi.

18:05.756 --> 18:07.087
He didn't face a holy war...

18:07.124 --> 18:09.217
and he didn't face
10,000 Remington rifles.

18:09.259 --> 18:13.093
If you send him to Khartoum
on his own now...

18:13.130 --> 18:15.758
he'll simply fail.

18:15.799 --> 18:17.494
What a pity.

18:20.003 --> 18:22.904
Sir, if General Gordon
accepted your proposal...

18:22.939 --> 18:26.375
and the conditions of today,
my respect for him would end.

18:26.410 --> 18:28.105
He'd be the vainest man alive.

18:28.145 --> 18:29.942
Thank you, Colonel Stewart.

18:29.980 --> 18:32.073
Now, would you leave us
to our deliberations?

18:32.115 --> 18:35.607
My congratulations on
the excellence of your report.

18:40.123 --> 18:41.454
Good day, sir.

18:43.060 --> 18:45.927
I like that man.

18:45.962 --> 18:48.260
Did I understand you correctly?

18:48.298 --> 18:50.425
If we send Gordon to Khartoum...

18:50.467 --> 18:53.231
Gordon, a national hero...
and he fails...

18:53.270 --> 18:56.501
then the blame will fall on him,
not on the government?

18:56.540 --> 18:58.508
It could happen that way.

18:58.542 --> 19:01.306
It's the most
abominable proposal...

19:01.344 --> 19:04.108
I have ever entertained.

19:04.147 --> 19:07.014
Granville,
the colonel had a point.

19:07.050 --> 19:09.610
Just why would Gordon do it?

19:09.653 --> 19:12.884
Because he's a patriot
and a man of conscience...

19:12.923 --> 19:16.450
or perhaps
the vainest man alive.

19:16.493 --> 19:20.395
I dislike everything about this.

19:20.430 --> 19:22.762
Worse, I distrust it.

19:22.799 --> 19:26.235
I know nothing
about this conversation.

19:26.269 --> 19:29.238
But let me know in Balmoral
what Gordon says.

19:29.272 --> 19:32.833
Her Majesty
would be so pleased.

19:51.261 --> 19:55.197
Apologize for the secrecy,
Gordon.

19:55.232 --> 19:56.893
Politics.

19:56.933 --> 19:59.231
Let's not waste time
with formalities.

19:59.269 --> 20:01.601
Sit down, please.

20:01.638 --> 20:04.004
I can't keep the train
for Scotland waiting forever...

20:04.040 --> 20:05.268
or there'd be curiosity.

20:05.308 --> 20:07.708
We need few words.

20:07.744 --> 20:11.111
Granville
will see you tomorrow...

20:11.148 --> 20:14.379
with a proposal
so disreputable...

20:14.417 --> 20:17.352
that I can have nothing
to do with it publicly.

20:17.387 --> 20:19.548
Privately,
I ask you to accept it.

20:19.589 --> 20:20.749
Why?

20:20.791 --> 20:23.589
Because it will provide me
with political comfort.

20:23.627 --> 20:26.790
I can conceive
of no commodity, sir...

20:26.830 --> 20:28.491
that could interest me less.

20:28.532 --> 20:29.965
I'm not a free agent, you know.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.161
I leave for the Belgian Congo
within weeks.

20:32.202 --> 20:34.500
Granville could arrange that.

20:34.538 --> 20:37.439
Gordon,
the Sudan was your child.

20:37.474 --> 20:40.966
I don't need to inform you
it's in the gravest danger.

20:41.011 --> 20:42.535
You don't need to inform me.

20:42.579 --> 20:44.046
Gordon, I cannot and will not...

20:44.080 --> 20:46.014
send military forces
up the Nile...

20:46.049 --> 20:48.813
but I admit Khartoum
cannot be left to its fate...

20:48.852 --> 20:50.547
without some gesture.

20:50.587 --> 20:52.054
Am I the gesture?

20:52.088 --> 20:53.715
The whole country
knows your capacities.

20:53.757 --> 20:57.625
You've done before alone what
an army of blunderers can't do.

20:57.661 --> 20:59.458
What's the proposal?

20:59.496 --> 21:00.861
That you go to the Sudan...

21:00.897 --> 21:03.127
supervise the evacuation
of Khartoum...

21:03.166 --> 21:06.067
do what you can to leave
peace and order behind.

21:06.102 --> 21:09.128
- With what powers?
- None.

21:09.172 --> 21:12.141
Egypt will give you
some ribbon or other.

21:12.175 --> 21:15.042
Politicians.

21:15.078 --> 21:17.774
And when the Mahdi
floats me down the Nile...

21:17.814 --> 21:20.214
the government will assume
a pained expression...

21:20.250 --> 21:22.445
and say to Her Majesty
and the churchmen...

21:22.485 --> 21:25.181
and the anti-slavery people,
"We sent Gordon.

21:25.222 --> 21:26.883
"We did the best we could."

21:26.923 --> 21:28.083
Precisely.

21:28.124 --> 21:32.993
That'll be the end of Gordon,
but not of Gladstone.

21:33.029 --> 21:34.758
In a nutshell.

21:36.967 --> 21:40.368
I must say, Mr. Gladstone,
you're hardly a bore.

21:40.403 --> 21:42.769
You don't bore me either,
Gordon.

21:42.806 --> 21:45.138
You're illogical
and insubordinate.

21:45.175 --> 21:46.733
I know if I send you
to Khartoum...

21:46.776 --> 21:48.767
you'll play tricks,
you'll exceed your orders...

21:48.812 --> 21:51.372
and in the name of some
mystical necessity...

21:51.414 --> 21:52.847
apparent only to yourself...

21:52.883 --> 21:56.375
you'll do your ingenious best
to involve this government...

21:56.419 --> 21:57.613
up to the hatband.

21:57.654 --> 21:59.212
But you're
in a very poor patch...

21:59.256 --> 22:01.383
and you have no one
to turn to but me.

22:01.424 --> 22:03.051
Again, in a nutshell.

22:03.093 --> 22:05.561
I'll take a chance on your
tricks. That's all I can say.

22:05.595 --> 22:08.564
I'll see Sir Evelyn Baring
in Cairo...

22:08.598 --> 22:10.225
brings pressure
on the Khedive...

22:10.267 --> 22:13.236
to appoint you Governor General
of the Sudan...

22:13.270 --> 22:15.738
but I cannot
and will not back you up.

22:15.772 --> 22:17.205
This must be understood.

22:17.240 --> 22:19.470
No British troops
will come up the Nile.

22:19.509 --> 22:23.411
I will not assume a British
obligation to police the world.

22:23.446 --> 22:26.244
If you can help the Sudan,
your country will be grateful.

22:26.283 --> 22:27.443
If you can't...

22:27.484 --> 22:29.918
My country will understand.

22:37.193 --> 22:38.626
I'll go.

22:42.332 --> 22:43.993
You'll come back safe.

22:44.034 --> 22:48.733
Gordon, first, last,
and above all...

22:48.772 --> 22:50.399
you'll come back safe.

22:50.440 --> 22:52.305
Do you hear me?

22:52.342 --> 22:54.105
I hear you.

22:57.314 --> 22:58.576
You'll need an aide.

22:58.615 --> 23:00.378
I have a good man in mind.

23:00.417 --> 23:02.214
Isn't such a choice
my prerogative?

23:02.252 --> 23:04.720
Not in this case.
He'll be useful to you.

23:04.754 --> 23:05.914
And to you.

23:05.956 --> 23:07.423
Naturally.

23:07.457 --> 23:09.357
Well, Gordon...

23:11.261 --> 23:15.254
God go with you,
and I don't envy God.

23:46.329 --> 23:47.990
Put my luggage aboard, please.

23:48.031 --> 23:49.225
Very good, sir.

24:03.446 --> 24:04.640
Yes?

24:07.784 --> 24:11.515
Your second-in-command, sir,
Colonel J.D.H. Stewart.

24:15.291 --> 24:18.419
So.

24:18.461 --> 24:20.156
This is for you, General.

24:20.196 --> 24:23.222
You'll find my report in here.
It'll bring you up to date.

24:23.266 --> 24:26.201
Am I to understand
that Gladstone has cursed me...

24:26.236 --> 24:28.431
not only with a spy,
but with a subordinate...

24:28.471 --> 24:30.132
who thinks he knows
more than I do?

24:30.173 --> 24:31.606
I was brought here
in chains, sir.

24:31.641 --> 24:33.040
I don't know what to think.

24:33.076 --> 24:34.304
Brandy and soda, sir.

24:34.344 --> 24:36.539
B & S? It sounds as though
you'll need one.

24:36.579 --> 24:39.514
- Thank you, sir.
- Right. Sit down.

24:39.549 --> 24:42.040
You are Gladstone's spy,
aren't you?

24:42.085 --> 24:43.484
Yes, sir.

24:43.520 --> 24:45.511
Would it be indiscreet
of your commanding officer...

24:45.555 --> 24:47.045
to inquire
as to your instructions?

24:47.090 --> 24:48.250
Not at all, sir.

24:48.291 --> 24:50.191
I am to report
to Mr. Gladstone...

24:50.226 --> 24:53.252
any actions you may take
which, in my opinion...

24:53.296 --> 24:55.890
conflict with your instructions.

24:55.932 --> 24:59.629
I am to inform you and
the government if necessary...

24:59.669 --> 25:02.900
of any situation
which, in my opinion...

25:02.939 --> 25:04.634
places you in physical danger.

25:04.674 --> 25:06.369
And if anybody in
the course of this mission...

25:06.409 --> 25:10.709
must risk his life,
then I'm to do it, not you.

25:10.747 --> 25:15.207
Apart from that, sir,
I'm yours to command.

25:15.251 --> 25:18.516
Tell me what, in your opinion,
Colonel Stewart...

25:18.555 --> 25:20.819
are the chances
of my sacking you?

25:20.857 --> 25:22.324
If they existed, sir...

25:22.358 --> 25:24.758
I'd be the first
to point them out to you.

25:24.794 --> 25:26.386
Drink your brandy.

25:29.399 --> 25:30.559
Thank you.

25:30.600 --> 25:33.330
We seem to have sailed.

25:33.369 --> 25:35.200
Farewell, England.

25:35.238 --> 25:39.004
So you and I are definitely
stuck with each other.

25:39.042 --> 25:40.339
Yes, sir.

25:40.376 --> 25:43.311
For heaven's sake, man,
sit down.

25:46.649 --> 25:48.480
May I ask a question?

25:48.518 --> 25:51.419
If it's impertinent,
I withdraw it.

25:51.454 --> 25:53.979
Why did you let them
talk you into this mission?

25:59.529 --> 26:03.329
As is well known, I regard
myself as a religious man...

26:03.366 --> 26:05.800
yet, I belong to no church.

26:05.835 --> 26:08.599
I'm an able soldier,
but I abhor armies.

26:08.638 --> 26:11.129
I could even add
that I've been introduced...

26:11.174 --> 26:13.734
to hundreds of women,
yet I've never married.

26:13.776 --> 26:16.438
In other words, no one's
ever talked me into anything.

26:16.479 --> 26:18.003
Does that answer your question?

26:18.047 --> 26:19.776
No, sir.

26:21.718 --> 26:24.380
Then let me suggest that
my life is not an open book...

26:24.420 --> 26:28.982
to you, to any man,
least of all to myself.

26:33.930 --> 26:37.525
With your permission, General,
I think I need a turn on deck.

26:42.405 --> 26:44.873
Send a telegram
as soon as we reach Calais.

26:44.908 --> 26:47.001
Sir Evelyn Baring, Cairo.

26:47.043 --> 26:49.568
Locate immediately
whereabouts Zobeir Pasha.

26:49.612 --> 26:50.977
Signed, Gordon.

26:52.415 --> 26:56.909
That's spelt Z-O-B-E-l-R.

26:58.621 --> 26:59.815
Yes, sir.

27:38.328 --> 27:40.956
I expected outrageous nonsense
from you, Gordon.

27:40.997 --> 27:43.227
I expected the worst,
but Zobeir Pasha.

27:43.266 --> 27:45.598
Even the Khedive was appalled.

27:45.635 --> 27:47.330
I see nothing outrageous,
Sir Evelyn.

27:47.370 --> 27:48.837
Zobeir's a Sudanese.

27:48.871 --> 27:50.736
He used to be the most
important man down there.

27:50.773 --> 27:53.640
He's able, wise,
still has a powerful influence.

27:53.676 --> 27:55.371
You'd like to take Zobeir
with you to Khartoum...

27:55.411 --> 27:57.072
to give him control
over the Sudan.

27:57.113 --> 27:58.808
Gordon,
the man is a slave trader.

27:58.848 --> 28:00.042
Was a slave trader.

28:00.083 --> 28:02.813
My instructions
are to evacuate Khartoum...

28:02.852 --> 28:04.911
and leave
some sort of order behind.

28:04.954 --> 28:07.081
How?
Well, most of the chiefs...

28:07.123 --> 28:09.523
Ioyal to the Mahdi today
used to be loyal to Zobeir.

28:09.559 --> 28:10.787
I think
they'd come back to him.

28:10.827 --> 28:14.820
Sir Evelyn, I cannot go
to Khartoum without a plan.

28:19.035 --> 28:22.004
- I insist on seeing Zobeir.
- Why would he see you?

28:22.038 --> 28:24.199
You not only put him
out of the slave trade...

28:24.240 --> 28:25.434
you killed his son
in the process.

28:25.475 --> 28:28.444
I must take the chance.
One must always take chances.

28:32.315 --> 28:35.148
Why is Towfik making us wait?

28:35.184 --> 28:37.015
Well, Sir Evelyn,
it's been my experience...

28:37.053 --> 28:39.044
that when you're giving
orders to sovereign princes...

28:39.088 --> 28:41.283
you have to expect
a little humiliation.

28:41.324 --> 28:43.121
It makes them feel better.

29:11.688 --> 29:14.782
Humbly, Highness,
I accept this command...

29:14.824 --> 29:16.291
as Governor General
of the Sudan...

29:16.326 --> 29:18.317
and I swear to you
my devoted service.

29:18.361 --> 29:20.158
Do you understand,
Gordon Pasha...

29:20.196 --> 29:22.630
that your wages
will only be £6,000 a year?

29:22.665 --> 29:24.428
It is all I can afford.

29:24.467 --> 29:28.233
I'll take 2,000.
It's all I need.

29:31.307 --> 29:33.366
What about a B & S?

30:12.215 --> 30:13.773
Sir.

30:18.921 --> 30:20.252
God be with us.

30:25.395 --> 30:27.795
Zobeir Pasha, you are well?

30:31.467 --> 30:33.196
General Gordon
goes to Khartoum...

30:33.236 --> 30:34.897
as Governor General
for the Khedive.

30:34.937 --> 30:37.701
He pays you his compliments,
and he would speak with you.

30:37.740 --> 30:40.436
This is my aide,
Colonel Stewart.

30:42.845 --> 30:45.177
We come from London, Zobeir.

30:45.214 --> 30:48.149
My government is determined
to lend Egypt no support...

30:48.184 --> 30:50.584
in the face of the uprising
and to prevail on the Khedive...

30:50.620 --> 30:53.646
to relinquish control
over the Sudan.

30:53.689 --> 30:55.623
Sir Evelyn
will confirm what I say.

30:55.658 --> 30:58.218
This is unwise.
There will be ruin...

30:58.261 --> 31:00.456
and death, and tears,
and little else.

31:00.496 --> 31:02.123
It is my government's policy.

31:02.165 --> 31:04.861
I have no authority
beyond evacuating...

31:04.901 --> 31:07.131
all Egyptians from Khartoum.

31:07.170 --> 31:08.432
I could wish otherwise.

31:08.471 --> 31:10.837
But you have the power
and the influence...

31:10.873 --> 31:13.068
and the ability
to oppose the Mahdi.

31:14.477 --> 31:16.104
Will you come with me
to Khartoum...

31:16.145 --> 31:18.477
and accept the Sudan
from my hands?

31:19.782 --> 31:21.773
Do I receive this offer...

31:21.818 --> 31:24.514
from the British government,
Sir Evelyn?

31:24.554 --> 31:28.422
No, my government renounces all
influence over Sudanese affairs.

31:28.458 --> 31:30.585
This is a matter
between you and General Gordon.

31:30.626 --> 31:34.221
If I give you my word that
there will be no slavery...

31:34.263 --> 31:36.857
I regard the institution
as ended...

31:36.899 --> 31:39.800
does my attitude
influence your government?

31:41.471 --> 31:44.736
I understand.
My reputation.

31:44.774 --> 31:48.141
But what would
your Christian world say...

31:48.177 --> 31:52.375
if the slaver Zobeir
received ten million Sudanese...

31:52.415 --> 31:54.849
from the hands
of the great Gordon Pasha?

31:54.884 --> 31:58.479
My government
would oppose you... publicly.

31:58.521 --> 32:02.184
I would defend you.
Publicly.

32:07.697 --> 32:10.530
The general will defend me.

32:13.369 --> 32:18.636
The great Christian hero
will defend Zobeir the slaver.

32:21.210 --> 32:24.236
Before I receive my country
from your bloody hands...

32:24.280 --> 32:26.339
I shall see it die.

32:28.684 --> 32:30.675
You killed my son.

32:34.257 --> 32:35.747
I executed him.

32:35.791 --> 32:39.090
Do you have sons, Gordon Pasha?

32:39.128 --> 32:41.062
Do you have sons?

32:41.097 --> 32:43.190
No.

32:43.232 --> 32:44.893
You killed mine.

32:44.934 --> 32:47.562
God forgive me, Zobeir.

32:49.138 --> 32:51.402
But let the dead
bury their dead.

32:51.440 --> 32:53.567
You killed my flesh!

32:53.609 --> 32:55.338
My blood!

32:55.378 --> 32:57.744
My suleman.

33:00.883 --> 33:07.220
Get thee from my house, and may
ye die in the desert untended.

33:07.256 --> 33:12.250
May vultures consume thy flesh,
sands thy blood.

33:28.210 --> 33:30.701
Go back. Go back to London.

33:30.746 --> 33:33.306
There's too much danger,
too little hope.

33:33.349 --> 33:35.544
I'll report
my news to Gladstone.

33:35.585 --> 33:38.452
I'll stand by you.

33:38.487 --> 33:40.250
Thank you.

33:40.289 --> 33:42.450
You said you had to have a plan.

33:42.491 --> 33:45.392
What can you do now?

33:45.428 --> 33:48.761
Get up the Nile to Khartoum.

34:14.223 --> 34:18.420
Stewart, just how far into
the Sudan would you say we are?

34:19.462 --> 34:22.920
We'll reach Berber
in an hour or so.

34:22.965 --> 34:25.263
In your report you said
that the Mahdi's people...

34:25.301 --> 34:28.862
wore jibbers
covered with patches.

34:28.904 --> 34:31.235
That's correct, sir.

34:31.273 --> 34:34.003
And his main force
is still beyond Khartoum?

34:34.043 --> 34:35.304
Yes, sir.

34:36.379 --> 34:39.610
Look there.
We haven't even reached Berber.

35:02.071 --> 35:03.538
Gordon Pasha!

35:06.208 --> 35:07.869
Ali lbrahim!

35:07.910 --> 35:10.310
Gordon Pasha!

35:10.346 --> 35:12.507
No, Ali. No!

35:12.548 --> 35:14.914
Sheikh Ali lbrahim
of the Manasir.

35:14.950 --> 35:16.508
My friend before God.

35:16.552 --> 35:17.849
Ali, please.

35:17.887 --> 35:21.288
I weep for joy.
We are saved! We are delivered!

35:21.323 --> 35:24.087
- Delivered?
- Berber is surrounded.

35:24.126 --> 35:28.062
I am cut off from my people,
except by the river.

35:28.097 --> 35:31.464
To the east, to the south,
to the north.

35:31.500 --> 35:34.765
Mohammed al Khalia, the villain,
he has gone over to the Mahdi...

35:34.804 --> 35:37.102
taking all the tribes
along this shore.

35:37.139 --> 35:38.902
We saw a band downriver.

35:38.941 --> 35:40.533
Did they get their guns
from the Mahdi?

35:40.576 --> 35:43.875
Since the terrible disaster
of Hicks Pasha...

35:43.913 --> 35:46.473
it seems all have guns.

35:46.515 --> 35:49.484
But you return,
and we are saved.

35:49.518 --> 35:52.510
- We are delivered.
- How? I bring no army.

35:52.555 --> 35:54.853
You will find a way,
Gordon Pasha.

35:54.890 --> 35:56.949
You have always found a way.

35:56.992 --> 36:02.897
My friends, we must drink coffee
and speak of the old days.

36:18.180 --> 36:20.978
Sir, I've prepared
a telegram for London.

36:21.016 --> 36:22.984
I request that you read it.

36:23.018 --> 36:24.747
I have an official
responsibility...

36:24.787 --> 36:26.914
to advise you
to turn back to Cairo.

36:26.956 --> 36:28.480
The situation has changed.

36:28.524 --> 36:30.924
Situations always change.

36:30.960 --> 36:32.552
Sir, Berber is surrounded.

36:32.595 --> 36:35.359
The uprising spread this far
while we traveled.

36:35.397 --> 36:37.297
You could be caught in a trap.

36:37.333 --> 36:39.563
Give me a camel,
I can get out of anything.

36:39.602 --> 36:41.536
You're a responsible spy.

36:41.570 --> 36:43.401
Send your telegram.

36:43.439 --> 36:45.964
You're bringing these people
nothing but false hopes...

36:46.008 --> 36:47.600
and false expectations.

36:47.643 --> 36:51.477
There are still 13,000 Egyptians
to be got out of Khartoum.

36:51.514 --> 36:53.243
If the government
had known that by now...

36:53.282 --> 36:55.807
there'd be armed Mahdis tribes
on both sides of the Nile...

36:55.851 --> 36:58.046
400 miles north of Khartoum...

36:58.087 --> 36:59.816
They wouldn't have sent me.

36:59.855 --> 37:01.914
Then you cannot proceed further.

37:01.957 --> 37:03.857
If Her Majesty's government...

37:03.893 --> 37:06.020
at this moment wants
to run out publicly...

37:06.061 --> 37:09.553
on the Egyptians,
send your telegram.

37:09.598 --> 37:11.190
Get them to recall me.

37:11.233 --> 37:13.497
But you have to make
the decision. They won't.

37:13.536 --> 37:16.164
I've made my decision,
Colonel Stewart.

37:16.205 --> 37:17.866
But what is your decision?

37:20.810 --> 37:25.179
General, when you left London,
your only hope was Zobeir.

37:25.214 --> 37:27.114
So, if you have
any further plan...

37:27.149 --> 37:31.347
beyond vague self-confidence,
you haven't confided it to me.

37:31.387 --> 37:34.550
Was I instructed
to confide in you?

37:34.590 --> 37:35.818
I don't recall.

37:35.858 --> 37:37.917
Are you willing
to delude the Sudanese...

37:37.960 --> 37:40.053
gull the Egyptians,
and compromise your country...

37:40.095 --> 37:41.960
just to satisfy
your own vanity?

37:45.301 --> 37:48.293
Next time I'll shoot you.

37:50.573 --> 37:53.474
I've shot men before.

37:53.509 --> 37:55.272
Now send your telegram.

38:10.860 --> 38:13.351
The boat is coming!

38:22.304 --> 38:24.272
Look at that!
Isn't that marvelous?

38:24.306 --> 38:26.103
How exciting!

38:26.141 --> 38:29.008
Everyone in Khartoum
must be on the coast.

38:43.893 --> 38:47.226
Gordon Pasha!

39:51.627 --> 39:54.027
Welcome back, Gordon Pasha.

39:54.063 --> 39:55.257
Thank you.

40:00.302 --> 40:03.066
It's good to be home again.

41:15.444 --> 41:18.038
You can't see anything
from down there.

42:01.690 --> 42:04.454
Gordon Pasha
will be with us shortly.

42:04.493 --> 42:06.484
Sheikh Abdul Rahim.

42:06.528 --> 42:09.019
Gordon Pasha
will be with us shortly.

42:10.332 --> 42:13.267
Mr. Frank Power, Her Majesty's
counsel in Khartoum.

42:13.302 --> 42:15.065
Also the "Times" correspondent.

42:15.104 --> 42:16.366
Where is he?

42:16.405 --> 42:18.498
Gordon Pasha
will be with us shortly.

42:20.109 --> 42:21.974
Monsieur Herbin,
French counsel.

42:22.010 --> 42:24.035
Gordon Pasha
will be with us shortly.

42:25.114 --> 42:28.345
- Khaleel, B & S.
- Yes, master.

42:38.160 --> 42:39.718
B & S.

42:39.761 --> 42:40.955
Thank you.

42:43.499 --> 42:47.265
Now, master,
it has been a very long time.

42:47.302 --> 42:49.793
So you cannot expect me
to remember all things...

42:49.838 --> 42:51.203
without confusion.

42:51.240 --> 42:53.231
For if you had
left me this Bible...

42:53.275 --> 42:54.902
then it would be different.

42:54.943 --> 42:57.104
I could not have read it,
but even so...

42:57.146 --> 42:59.307
- Khaleel.
- I'm here, master.

42:59.348 --> 43:01.373
Khaleel, there's something
I want you to do for me.

43:01.416 --> 43:02.576
And I shall do it, master.

43:02.618 --> 43:05.212
Now, this great Jesus Christ,
sometime, master...

43:05.254 --> 43:06.812
I do not understand this man.

43:06.855 --> 43:09.346
For He announced, and He
was very clear about it...

43:09.391 --> 43:10.688
for once He was very clear...

43:10.726 --> 43:12.353
almost like
the great Lord Mohammed...

43:12.394 --> 43:13.725
bless him and peace be upon him.

43:13.762 --> 43:16.390
But I do not understand
this Jesus Christ.

43:16.431 --> 43:19.559
For as I remember, you told me,
He announced most clearly...

43:19.601 --> 43:20.898
as I have said...

43:20.936 --> 43:23.734
Khaleel, there's something
I want you to do.

43:23.772 --> 43:25.262
You have only to speak master.

43:25.307 --> 43:29.107
Now, He say when a man
is struck upon one cheek...

43:29.144 --> 43:30.304
he must turn the other.

43:30.345 --> 43:32.575
Do you? No.

43:38.954 --> 43:40.421
You don't.

43:40.455 --> 43:44.755
I must inform you, Khaleel,
as delicately as possible...

43:44.793 --> 43:47.159
that I am not Jesus Christ.

43:49.031 --> 43:51.693
Wait! Will you first
find out for me...

43:51.733 --> 43:53.997
where the Mahdi's camp
is at present?

44:22.998 --> 44:24.556
Khaleel.

44:54.930 --> 44:56.158
Peace be with you.

44:56.198 --> 44:57.665
Peace be with you.

44:57.699 --> 44:59.963
Send a messenger
to Mohammed Ahmed...

45:00.002 --> 45:01.560
who is called the Mahdi...

45:01.603 --> 45:03.264
and tell him
that Gordon Pasha...

45:03.305 --> 45:06.274
Governor General of the Sudan,
has entered his camp.

45:06.308 --> 45:09.072
It is a lie before God!
He is not Gordon Pasha!

45:34.436 --> 45:37.166
Abdullah! Gordon Pasha is here!

45:37.205 --> 45:39.070
How does he appear?

45:39.107 --> 45:41.837
The skin is pink.
The beard is only here.

45:41.877 --> 45:43.242
It is gray.

45:43.278 --> 45:44.905
Khartoum.

45:44.946 --> 45:47.574
Holy person, we saw him
yesterday in Khartoum.

45:47.616 --> 45:49.311
It is Gordon Pasha.

45:49.351 --> 45:50.716
How many are his soldiers?

45:50.752 --> 45:52.947
He is alone
with one black slave.

45:52.988 --> 45:55.422
I fear it. He makes magic.

45:55.457 --> 45:57.550
We saw it yesterday
in the streets.

45:57.592 --> 45:58.820
Kill him.

46:01.430 --> 46:03.091
You're all so innocent.

46:03.131 --> 46:05.099
Who makes the magic
that brings him...

46:05.133 --> 46:08.728
to my camp alone
with one black slave?

46:08.770 --> 46:10.704
He...

46:10.739 --> 46:13.367
or I?

46:13.408 --> 46:15.273
Bring the great one to me.

47:14.886 --> 47:17.354
Is it because you are
an infidel, Gordon Pasha...

47:17.388 --> 47:21.449
that I feel myself
in the presence of evil?

47:21.493 --> 47:24.690
I doubt it, Mohammed Ahmed,
for you are not an infidel...

47:24.729 --> 47:26.287
and I smell evil.

47:29.868 --> 47:32.564
I have 30,000 soldiers
in my camp.

47:32.604 --> 47:34.572
Is it because
you are so brave...

47:34.606 --> 47:36.836
or so foolish,
that you come here alone...

47:36.875 --> 47:40.504
unarmed, with only
a black slave to hold your robe?

47:42.113 --> 47:44.240
Khaleel is not a slave.
He is a free man.

47:44.282 --> 47:46.716
He comes with me out of love.

47:46.751 --> 47:50.414
And he does not hold my robe,
but a gift for you.

47:50.455 --> 47:52.116
Years ago, Mohammed Ahmed...

47:52.157 --> 47:54.591
I led the armies
of the Emperor of China...

47:54.626 --> 47:56.184
at a time of great trial.

47:56.227 --> 47:59.287
And when his enemies
were crushed and confounded...

47:59.330 --> 48:03.232
and his throne was again secure,
he made me this gift.

48:03.268 --> 48:05.327
I have brought it
from London for you.

48:07.839 --> 48:10.831
It is most exquisite.

48:10.875 --> 48:14.675
When the Emperor of China
ceases to be a non-believer...

48:14.712 --> 48:17.272
and accepts me,
the Expected One...

48:17.315 --> 48:19.283
as the true Mahdi...

48:19.317 --> 48:22.753
then I shall be happy
to receive such a gift.

48:25.356 --> 48:27.881
Khaleel?

48:27.926 --> 48:29.621
You will wait just outside.

48:34.499 --> 48:36.694
Abria. Real abria.

48:36.734 --> 48:38.702
I've had none in five years.

48:41.639 --> 48:45.040
Your meeting with Zobeir Pasha
was less than happy, I believe.

48:46.778 --> 48:48.541
Your intelligence service...

48:48.580 --> 48:51.208
has an excellence
beyond my expectations.

48:51.249 --> 48:53.877
How much you must regret
having killed his son.

48:55.620 --> 48:59.556
I executed his son.
I have no regrets.

48:59.591 --> 49:01.354
It was a necessary
object lesson...

49:01.392 --> 49:03.690
in my campaign
against the slave trade.

49:03.728 --> 49:05.923
And it was successful.

49:05.964 --> 49:07.932
I brought peace to the Sudan.

49:09.567 --> 49:11.797
But since
you have come back now...

49:11.836 --> 49:14.634
with instructions
to evacuate Khartoum...

49:14.672 --> 49:17.300
most happily,
the peace of the Sudan...

49:17.342 --> 49:18.775
no longer concerns you.

49:20.178 --> 49:22.510
What a pleasure it is
to negotiate with a man...

49:22.547 --> 49:24.481
who knows even my instructions.

49:24.515 --> 49:27.780
We need waste so little time
on preliminaries.

49:28.820 --> 49:32.847
What are your instructions
concerning Khartoum?

49:41.599 --> 49:44.193
I have been instructed
by the Prophet...

49:44.235 --> 49:47.204
blessings and peace
be upon him...

49:47.238 --> 49:50.230
to worship
in the Khartoum mosque.

49:54.245 --> 49:57.908
There are those among the
Sudanese who will oppose you.

49:57.949 --> 50:00.509
I welcome in peace
all those who worship with me.

50:02.720 --> 50:03.914
And the others?

50:10.695 --> 50:14.096
Mohammed Ahmed,
may I suggest...

50:14.132 --> 50:17.124
that when first
I came to the Sudan...

50:17.168 --> 50:23.198
its body was sick, stricken
with hunger and abused by war.

50:23.241 --> 50:27.644
I cured it... and this land...

50:28.880 --> 50:32.247
I'm not a loving man,
Mohammed Ahmed...

50:32.283 --> 50:37.687
but this land became the only
thing that I've ever loved.

50:39.257 --> 50:43.057
I cannot, under my God...
do you understand?

50:43.094 --> 50:45.324
I cannot leave it
to the sickness...

50:45.363 --> 50:47.991
and the misery
in which I once found it.

50:49.033 --> 50:52.161
I respect you, Gordon Pasha.

50:52.203 --> 50:54.637
I make no war on you.

50:54.672 --> 50:56.902
Make no war on your own people.

50:56.941 --> 50:58.738
I'll take the Egyptians
back to Egypt.

50:58.776 --> 51:00.710
I'll leave the Sudan
to the Sudanese...

51:00.745 --> 51:03.873
and be happy and contented,
but if I'm to leave Khartoum...

51:03.915 --> 51:07.510
to sickness and misery,
to death...

51:08.986 --> 51:12.149
The Egyptians
must remain in Khartoum.

51:18.096 --> 51:20.826
I am a poor man of the desert.

51:20.865 --> 51:24.460
But I am the Mahdi,
the Expected One.

51:24.502 --> 51:28.097
On my cheek is the mole.

51:28.139 --> 51:29.731
Between my teeth...

51:31.642 --> 51:34.042
the space.

51:34.078 --> 51:37.809
And so that all men may know
that I am the true Mahdi...

51:37.849 --> 51:41.717
the Prophet Mohammed, blessings
and peace be upon him...

51:41.753 --> 51:44.313
makes miracles.

51:44.355 --> 51:46.448
Do you understand?

51:49.694 --> 51:51.355
I begin to.

51:53.598 --> 51:57.932
Gordon Pasha, do you believe
that the Prophet...

51:57.969 --> 52:00.199
blessings be upon him,
has instructed me...

52:00.238 --> 52:04.572
to pray only in
the mosque at Khartoum?

52:04.609 --> 52:08.943
No. I am to pray
in the mosque at Cairo...

52:08.980 --> 52:11.141
and at Mecca, and at Baghdad...

52:11.182 --> 52:14.117
and in the mosque
at Constantinople.

52:14.152 --> 52:19.454
He has commanded me to make
holy war until all of Islam...

52:19.490 --> 52:21.822
acknowledges the purity
of his biddings...

52:21.859 --> 52:27.024
and all the world
trembles before me.

52:27.064 --> 52:30.761
But all Islam
must know who I am.

52:31.936 --> 52:33.767
And believe.

52:35.072 --> 52:39.771
Gordon Pasha,
for tasks of such greatness...

52:39.811 --> 52:42.541
great deeds are needed.

52:42.580 --> 52:44.912
Egypt opposes me...

52:44.949 --> 52:49.113
and so the Egyptians
must remain in Khartoum.

52:49.153 --> 52:51.451
For I shall take it in blood...

52:51.489 --> 52:53.423
and the streets
will run in blood...

52:53.458 --> 52:56.825
and the Nile will taste
of blood for a hundred miles...

52:56.861 --> 53:02.822
and every Egyptian will die...
every child, woman, man.

53:02.867 --> 53:07.634
Sudanese, too, who opposes
the will of my Lord Mohammed...

53:07.672 --> 53:10.106
will die.

53:10.141 --> 53:14.237
This is how it must be
in Khartoum.

53:14.278 --> 53:16.974
Great and terrible thing.

53:17.014 --> 53:20.245
Or I shall not pray
in the mosques of Cairo...

53:20.284 --> 53:22.081
and Mecca,
and Constantinople...

53:22.119 --> 53:26.453
nor will the world
ever tremble before me.

53:31.262 --> 53:36.165
I had thought in my lifetime
that I had witnessed all things.

53:36.200 --> 53:38.464
And you have.

53:38.503 --> 53:43.031
You have described to me
how it was an object lesson...

53:43.074 --> 53:46.635
when you slaughtered
the sons of the slavers...

53:46.677 --> 53:49.908
and brought peace to the Sudan.

53:49.947 --> 53:53.212
You have no regrets.

53:53.251 --> 53:56.152
What is the difference,
Gordon Pasha?

53:56.187 --> 54:02.592
An infidel object lesson,
or a holy miracle?

54:02.627 --> 54:04.492
If Khartoum is sacrificed...

54:04.529 --> 54:06.929
then all Islam
will tremble and bow...

54:06.964 --> 54:09.956
and in peace I shall proceed...

54:10.001 --> 54:12.663
to all the mosques
where I must pray...

54:12.703 --> 54:17.197
and the lives of millions
will be spared.

54:17.241 --> 54:20.699
Whisper to me, Gordon Pasha...

54:22.580 --> 54:24.571
if they are different.

54:26.784 --> 54:29.014
This is how it will be.

54:31.088 --> 54:32.953
This is how it will be.

55:04.622 --> 55:06.886
Stewart Pasha.

55:12.330 --> 55:14.195
He's back, sir.

55:27.612 --> 55:29.637
Excellency,
he has had no sleep.

55:29.680 --> 55:31.170
General!

55:44.061 --> 55:47.758
You have... been to the Mahdi.

55:54.505 --> 55:58.202
He plans to lay siege
to Khartoum...

55:58.242 --> 56:00.938
take it by force.

56:00.978 --> 56:04.004
To slaughter all the Egyptians

56:04.048 --> 56:07.279
and those Sudanese
who haven't accepted him.

56:07.318 --> 56:11.345
But there are 35,000 people
in Khartoum.

56:11.389 --> 56:16.884
Those are his purposes,
and I believe him.

56:18.896 --> 56:22.127
The man is sincere.

56:22.166 --> 56:25.897
He believes utterly
in the divine necessity...

56:25.936 --> 56:27.767
for what he's doing.

56:27.805 --> 56:30.330
How could I have been
such a stumbling fool?

56:30.374 --> 56:32.308
I'm a man
who will question anything...

56:32.343 --> 56:34.743
except my own
religious convictions.

56:34.779 --> 56:36.679
The Mahdi's no different.

56:36.714 --> 56:40.081
There's vanity for you.

56:40.117 --> 56:42.449
I seem to have suffered
from the illusion...

56:42.486 --> 56:45.887
that I have a monopoly on God.

56:45.923 --> 56:48.892
It's the failure.

56:48.926 --> 56:50.985
There are so many things
I'm not afraid of...

56:51.028 --> 56:55.658
but... to fail...

56:55.700 --> 56:58.032
You haven't failed, sir.

56:58.069 --> 57:02.472
Who else could have found out
the Mahdi's intentions?

57:04.041 --> 57:05.474
If I'd known
about this in London...

57:05.509 --> 57:08.637
would I have recommended
against sending an army?

57:08.679 --> 57:12.046
How could any British government
survive a massacre like this...

57:12.083 --> 57:15.450
without making
some attempt to forestall it?

57:15.486 --> 57:19.980
Yes. Get off a telegram
to Cairo, immediately.

57:20.024 --> 57:22.686
If the government
moves on this, they can...

57:22.727 --> 57:23.921
Sir.

57:25.796 --> 57:27.388
The telegraph's been cut.

57:32.670 --> 57:35.298
- Where?
- Below Metemmah.

57:37.508 --> 57:40.773
- When?
- Today.

57:40.811 --> 57:45.874
Sir, Mohammed al Khalia
attacked Berber at dawn.

57:45.916 --> 57:47.440
Your friend
Sheikh Ali lbrahim...

57:47.485 --> 57:49.385
escaped downriver
at 10:00 this morning...

57:49.420 --> 57:51.149
and since then
there's been no message.

57:51.188 --> 57:53.247
We presume the city's fallen.

57:53.290 --> 57:57.522
If so, the Nile is closed.

57:57.561 --> 58:00.291
The evacuation.
We must get these people...

58:00.331 --> 58:02.663
Sir, there isn't going
to be any evacuation.

58:02.700 --> 58:06.192
If they hold Berber,
they've closed the Nile.

58:10.207 --> 58:13.472
Sweet Jesus.

58:19.083 --> 58:21.313
There is no alternative.

58:21.352 --> 58:23.843
Gladstone must send an army.

58:26.123 --> 58:28.057
If they've closed the Nile
at Berber...

58:28.092 --> 58:31.255
we can get messengers across
the desert as far as Debba.

58:31.295 --> 58:32.785
The telegraph
must be working there.

58:32.830 --> 58:34.661
Yes. They can't
have got that far.

58:34.698 --> 58:36.529
Call your staff together,
Stewart.

58:36.567 --> 58:38.558
We must check the food supplies.

58:38.602 --> 58:41.435
We'll manage till help comes.

58:41.472 --> 58:44.168
I've been an engineer
all my days.

58:44.208 --> 58:47.735
If I can't fortify a city with
rivers on two sides of it...

58:47.778 --> 58:49.245
I should be broken to the ranks.

58:49.280 --> 58:51.510
- Go on.
- Sir.

59:15.940 --> 59:19.569
Save Gordon.

59:34.191 --> 59:36.989
Prime Minister, how many more
of these debates...

59:37.027 --> 59:39.757
can we survive?
We must do something.

59:39.797 --> 59:41.662
If Gordon can get messengers
out of Khartoum...

59:41.699 --> 59:43.030
he can get himself out.

59:43.067 --> 59:44.227
Prime Minister, please.

59:44.268 --> 59:46.327
Who is the government,
Gordon or I?

59:46.370 --> 59:47.530
I've been talking to Wolseley.

59:47.571 --> 59:50.096
He can send a small detachment
into the Sudan.

59:50.140 --> 59:51.630
He promises
no further than Debba.

59:51.675 --> 59:54.303
I'll make no compromises
with this man, Granville.

59:54.345 --> 59:56.404
I've distrusted him always,
I distrust him now.

59:56.447 --> 01:00:00.178
A small detachment, for
communication purposes only.

01:00:00.217 --> 01:00:02.048
A gesture.

01:00:02.086 --> 01:00:05.783
We are in trouble!

01:00:08.125 --> 01:00:11.390
Well, a small detachment.

01:00:11.428 --> 01:00:13.396
But I will not
turn this government...

01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:15.227
to overseas adventure.

01:00:15.266 --> 01:00:17.757
Not for all the Gordons,
the sentimentalists...

01:00:17.801 --> 01:00:20.429
the plots, the intrigues.

01:00:20.471 --> 01:00:22.462
Save Gordon.

01:00:30.147 --> 01:00:32.547
Now then, we are here.

01:00:32.583 --> 01:00:35.017
You see, here's the city wall
right there...

01:00:35.052 --> 01:00:36.883
with your guns
emplaced all along.

01:00:36.921 --> 01:00:38.889
And this is the ditch
we're digging...

01:00:38.923 --> 01:00:41.323
connecting the white Nile
to the blue Nile.

01:00:41.358 --> 01:00:45.089
Now, when it's flooded, the city
will become an island...

01:00:45.129 --> 01:00:46.653
and if the Mahdi
crosses the river...

01:00:46.697 --> 01:00:50.258
and attacks from out here,
the ditch will stop any charge.

01:00:50.301 --> 01:00:52.132
But you must have
your guns emplaced...

01:00:52.169 --> 01:00:54.399
so that their fields
of fire overlap...

01:00:54.438 --> 01:00:55.905
then if one gun
is knocked out...

01:00:55.940 --> 01:00:58.773
the next will still cover
the same field.

01:00:58.809 --> 01:01:01.778
- Do you understand?
- I understand, Gordon Pasha.

01:01:01.812 --> 01:01:03.939
I sincerely hope so, Major.

01:01:03.981 --> 01:01:06.313
Off you go.

01:01:44.188 --> 01:01:46.122
I've been wondering, sir.

01:01:46.156 --> 01:01:48.818
The Nile's aflood at the moment.

01:01:48.859 --> 01:01:51.225
What happens when it falls
and our ditch goes dry?

01:01:51.261 --> 01:01:52.660
That won't be till next winter.

01:01:52.696 --> 01:01:54.254
If they haven't
sent an army by then...

01:01:54.298 --> 01:01:57.096
we'll all be dead of old age.

01:01:57.134 --> 01:02:00.160
I don't think the Mahdi's
waiting for that.

01:02:00.204 --> 01:02:03.799
I just saw them putting up his
personal tents over the river.

01:02:03.841 --> 01:02:05.604
He's moving up.

01:02:05.642 --> 01:02:08.133
Well, I could have the ditch
flooded in a few days.

01:02:08.178 --> 01:02:10.738
Good. I don't think
he'll attack for a while.

01:02:10.781 --> 01:02:14.979
He'll try to tighten
the siege first, weaken us.

01:02:15.019 --> 01:02:19.752
I want you to help me plan
a giant-sized raiding party.

01:02:19.790 --> 01:02:21.587
I want to take it upcountry
between the rivers...

01:02:21.625 --> 01:02:23.354
and bring back
every head of cattle...

01:02:23.394 --> 01:02:25.624
every measure of wheat
for a hundred miles.

01:02:25.662 --> 01:02:27.459
It might have to last us
quite a while.

01:02:27.498 --> 01:02:30.558
Sounds like a dangerous job,
so I better do it.

01:02:30.601 --> 01:02:32.091
It's in the orders.

01:02:32.136 --> 01:02:34.297
Forget the orders.
Finish your ditch.

01:02:34.338 --> 01:02:35.635
Flood it when you're ready.

01:02:35.672 --> 01:02:38.072
Meanwhile,
let me have a little fun.

01:04:11.835 --> 01:04:13.826
Stewart Pasha.

01:04:13.871 --> 01:04:16.169
Gordon Pasha
is ten miles from the city...

01:04:16.206 --> 01:04:18.265
with a great convoy
of grain and cattle.

01:04:18.308 --> 01:04:21.402
A spy brings news the Mahdi
is attacking him at dawn.

01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:06.087
They're out there somewhere.

01:05:28.712 --> 01:05:30.577
We'll make a stand
and hold them...

01:05:30.614 --> 01:05:33.208
while you take all the cattle
and grain into Khartoum.

01:05:33.250 --> 01:05:35.275
If we divide,
they'll have to divide.

01:05:35.319 --> 01:05:36.547
You take all the cavalry
with you...

01:05:36.587 --> 01:05:38.020
but don't let them turn you.

01:05:38.055 --> 01:05:40.546
You must get the convoy
into Khartoum.

01:05:40.591 --> 01:05:43.424
- Good luck to you.
- Sir!

01:05:55.272 --> 01:05:56.864
Hurry!

01:06:05.749 --> 01:06:08.149
You, up the pace. Come on!

01:06:26.036 --> 01:06:28.903
Now then, we can hold them here
while the convoy gets away.

01:06:28.939 --> 01:06:31.339
But keep your men low.
Don't give them a target.

01:06:31.375 --> 01:06:33.843
Dismount yourselves.
Get your horses down, too.

01:06:33.877 --> 01:06:35.344
Let them charge through us.

01:06:35.379 --> 01:06:37.677
Once they've passed us, we'll
have them against the light.

01:06:37.714 --> 01:06:39.978
Well, good luck then.

01:06:40.017 --> 01:06:42.349
Be quick.

01:07:54.358 --> 01:07:55.655
Re-form!

01:07:55.692 --> 01:07:57.660
Re-form and prepare to fire!

01:07:57.694 --> 01:08:00.219
They're coming out
of the light this time.

01:08:04.701 --> 01:08:06.328
Stand fast.

01:08:06.370 --> 01:08:08.565
Prepare to fire.

01:08:08.605 --> 01:08:10.163
Fire!

01:08:48.178 --> 01:08:51.477
Move forward!

01:09:05.028 --> 01:09:08.429
Ready... charge!

01:09:26.950 --> 01:09:29.077
They'll come at us again
from the dark now.

01:09:29.118 --> 01:09:30.779
Take cover!

01:10:06.256 --> 01:10:07.484
Re-form!

01:11:02.112 --> 01:11:04.910
Nearly three hundred dead.

01:11:04.948 --> 01:11:07.508
How much of the convoy
did we lose?

01:11:07.551 --> 01:11:11.487
None. You must have brought in
all the loose grain and beef...

01:11:11.521 --> 01:11:14.513
this side of Abyssinia.

01:11:14.558 --> 01:11:17.322
It'll have to last us
till relief comes.

01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:24.126
This came yesterday
via Cairo and Kitchener.

01:11:24.167 --> 01:11:26.260
- I've read it.
- Who's Kitchener?

01:11:26.303 --> 01:11:29.397
He's a major who's arrived
at Debba with an army.

01:11:29.439 --> 01:11:32.340
Precisely twenty men.

01:11:41.685 --> 01:11:44.813
"You exaggerate
the danger, sir.

01:11:44.854 --> 01:11:46.583
"Suspicion still exists, sir...

01:11:46.623 --> 01:11:48.318
"that you've created
a situation...

01:11:48.358 --> 01:11:51.088
"to fit your own personal
inclinations.

01:11:51.127 --> 01:11:53.527
"Leave Khartoum at once, sir.

01:11:53.563 --> 01:11:57.795
"This is you last,
final, ultimate order."

01:11:57.834 --> 01:12:01.497
Obey the order, General.

01:12:01.538 --> 01:12:06.999
Go to London. Explain to them.
You'll come back with an army.

01:12:07.043 --> 01:12:09.534
I'll come back with an army.

01:12:09.579 --> 01:12:12.377
They wouldn't listen to me.

01:12:12.415 --> 01:12:14.849
If they did,
they wouldn't believe me.

01:12:14.884 --> 01:12:17.785
If they believed me,
they'd keep me in England...

01:12:17.821 --> 01:12:21.689
if they had to lock me up
in the tower of London.

01:12:23.793 --> 01:12:26.421
You're the one to go.

01:12:26.463 --> 01:12:28.954
They'd believe you
if I stayed here as a hostage.

01:12:28.999 --> 01:12:31.126
They'd believe you
because they must!

01:12:31.167 --> 01:12:32.634
I'll give you Khaleel.

01:12:32.669 --> 01:12:35.297
He knows the route through
the desert and the wells.

01:12:35.338 --> 01:12:37.465
We've enough food here now
to hold out for months.

01:12:37.507 --> 01:12:40.374
The Nile's too high
for the Mahdi to attack.

01:12:40.410 --> 01:12:41.672
You must do it.

01:12:41.711 --> 01:12:43.838
Yes, sir.

01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:45.814
Let's get back.

01:13:40.970 --> 01:13:42.665
Kitchener.

01:13:47.577 --> 01:13:50.512
I'll take cholera, dysentery,
sunstroke, fleas in my bed...

01:13:50.547 --> 01:13:53.141
Arabs in my hair,
but I cannot take politicians.

01:13:53.183 --> 01:13:55.481
I wish you well, by heaven...

01:13:55.518 --> 01:13:58.043
but I don't envy you
what you're up against.

01:13:58.088 --> 01:14:01.285
Your man better stay with us
until you get back.

01:14:09.799 --> 01:14:11.323
Colonel Stewart, sir.

01:14:12.535 --> 01:14:14.503
Get out of the way!

01:14:14.537 --> 01:14:17.301
Say nothing, sir.
Your carriage is there, sir.

01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:19.808
Clear the way, please.
Say nothing.

01:14:29.152 --> 01:14:30.676
Sir.

01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:33.883
I wasn't prepared
for all this excitement.

01:14:39.095 --> 01:14:41.825
The prime minister's
waiting for you.

01:14:41.865 --> 01:14:43.127
I want you to know
before you see him...

01:14:43.166 --> 01:14:44.360
that he missed
a vote of censure...

01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:47.335
in the House of Commons
yesterday by only a few votes.

01:14:47.370 --> 01:14:50.703
I want you to know also that
I'm on General Gordon's side.

01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:52.901
You mean there's hope, sir?

01:14:52.942 --> 01:14:54.409
I mean nothing of the sort.

01:14:54.444 --> 01:14:55.604
Let's put all that aside.

01:14:55.645 --> 01:14:57.306
There's just one thing
that matters.

01:14:57.347 --> 01:15:01.181
Did Gordon or did he not receive
a direct order to return?

01:15:01.217 --> 01:15:02.377
He did.

01:15:02.418 --> 01:15:04.648
Could Gordon or could he not be
standing there in front of me?

01:15:04.687 --> 01:15:05.847
He could.

01:15:05.889 --> 01:15:07.618
Then, Colonel Stewart...

01:15:07.657 --> 01:15:10.319
does your presence here
confirm or deny...

01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:12.294
Gordon's total disobedience?

01:15:12.328 --> 01:15:16.025
- It confirms it.
- It's blackmail!

01:15:16.065 --> 01:15:19.125
A man... one man...
in the middle of Africa...

01:15:19.169 --> 01:15:21.467
is blackmailing
the British government...

01:15:21.504 --> 01:15:22.937
into a course of action...

01:15:22.972 --> 01:15:24.872
it wouldn't otherwise
choose to take.

01:15:24.908 --> 01:15:26.535
I don't agree, sir.

01:15:26.576 --> 01:15:29.704
You don't agree?

01:15:29.746 --> 01:15:33.944
Is it really blackmail
when one man...

01:15:33.983 --> 01:15:36.474
a long way off
in a besieged desert town...

01:15:36.519 --> 01:15:38.350
calls to you and says...

01:15:38.388 --> 01:15:40.447
"Allow these tens of thousands
of human beings...

01:15:40.490 --> 01:15:42.458
"to be slaughtered,
if you will.

01:15:42.492 --> 01:15:44.892
"It's your decision.
But allow me the privilege...

01:15:44.928 --> 01:15:46.520
"of being slaughtered
with them"?

01:15:46.563 --> 01:15:51.193
You see, sir, if Khartoum
is allowed to die...

01:15:51.234 --> 01:15:53.794
then Gordon will die with it.

01:15:55.238 --> 01:15:57.570
It may be blackmail...

01:15:57.607 --> 01:16:01.543
and if it is,
then I'm for blackmail.

01:16:09.752 --> 01:16:12.482
Send in Lord Wolseley.

01:16:12.522 --> 01:16:16.288
When I think how history
will record someday...

01:16:16.326 --> 01:16:19.159
that the decisions
of an empire were made only...

01:16:19.195 --> 01:16:22.187
by greedy businessmen,
scheming generals...

01:16:22.232 --> 01:16:26.134
and conniving politicians...

01:16:26.169 --> 01:16:28.694
It's up the Nile for you,
Wolseley.

01:16:28.738 --> 01:16:33.198
Up the Nile to save
one stubborn madman.

01:16:33.243 --> 01:16:37.839
But let me tell you,
if you do a Billy Hicks on me...

01:16:37.881 --> 01:16:40.975
if you take a British army
into central Africa...

01:16:41.017 --> 01:16:43.918
and present me with
any portion of a disaster...

01:16:43.953 --> 01:16:46.683
then don't come back.

01:16:46.723 --> 01:16:48.122
Am I clear?

01:16:48.157 --> 01:16:49.681
You are clear.

01:16:49.726 --> 01:16:51.694
Colonel Stewart,
inform your General Gordon...

01:16:51.728 --> 01:16:53.389
that a British army
will be sailing...

01:16:53.429 --> 01:16:56.523
as quickly as possible
for Cairo.

01:16:56.566 --> 01:16:58.500
Thank you, sir.

01:16:58.534 --> 01:16:59.728
Sir.

01:20:31.337 --> 01:20:32.565
Khaleel.

01:20:32.605 --> 01:20:34.766
Get me Colonel Stewart's man,
Khaleel.

01:20:34.807 --> 01:20:36.001
Sir.

01:20:42.215 --> 01:20:43.807
We didn't want
to come to the palace.

01:20:43.850 --> 01:20:46.444
This is informal,
but it's serious.

01:20:46.486 --> 01:20:48.420
General, people are afraid.

01:20:48.454 --> 01:20:50.820
They have a right to be.

01:20:50.857 --> 01:20:52.848
What about this relief army?

01:20:52.892 --> 01:20:56.623
Why the hysteria?
There's still enough food.

01:20:56.662 --> 01:21:00.723
What we're short of isn't food.
It's hope.

01:21:00.767 --> 01:21:02.632
Power, you're English.
You know the government...

01:21:02.668 --> 01:21:04.636
how long they take
to make decisions.

01:21:04.670 --> 01:21:07.138
You all know how many weeks
it is to London...

01:21:07.173 --> 01:21:08.333
how many weeks back.

01:21:08.374 --> 01:21:10.706
It could be another month
before we have word.

01:21:10.743 --> 01:21:12.768
I'm an old friend,
you believe me.

01:21:12.812 --> 01:21:16.145
I tell you, in the bazaars,
I hear things.

01:21:16.182 --> 01:21:17.479
It isn't good.

01:21:17.517 --> 01:21:22.250
What am I supposed to give them,
promises I can't keep?

01:21:22.288 --> 01:21:24.483
Tell them lies
to keep up morale?

01:21:24.524 --> 01:21:27.152
Maybe small lies. Just a few.

01:21:27.193 --> 01:21:28.820
Little ones?

01:21:33.633 --> 01:21:35.294
Khaleel!

01:21:35.334 --> 01:21:36.824
Yes, master? Good morning.

01:21:36.869 --> 01:21:38.097
It is such a pleasant thing to...

01:21:38.137 --> 01:21:40.071
Khaleel,
what are you doing here?

01:21:40.106 --> 01:21:41.573
Where is Colonel Stewart?

01:21:41.607 --> 01:21:43.165
Yes, master, I do not know.

01:21:43.209 --> 01:21:44.904
But as I was saying,
that little place, Debba...

01:21:44.944 --> 01:21:46.377
by the river,
is the most boring place...

01:21:46.412 --> 01:21:48.175
- Khaleel!
- I'm to be home.

01:21:48.214 --> 01:21:51.081
Yes, the Major Kitchener
sends his greetings.

01:21:51.117 --> 01:21:53.585
Most interesting man,
the Major Kitchener.

01:22:04.063 --> 01:22:06.122
It's Stewart.
He's sailed from England...

01:22:06.165 --> 01:22:08.360
with Wolseley and 7,000 men!

01:22:09.869 --> 01:22:11.393
They're coming!

01:22:11.437 --> 01:22:13.462
The British are coming!

01:22:38.664 --> 01:22:42.532
I do not have the ingredient
here, Gordon Pasha...

01:22:42.568 --> 01:22:44.160
but if you will come back
to the palace...

01:22:44.203 --> 01:22:46.694
I will make you a B & S.

01:22:55.915 --> 01:22:58.543
Squad, attention!

01:22:58.584 --> 01:23:00.814
Stand the camels.

01:23:02.889 --> 01:23:04.823
Mount!

01:23:39.792 --> 01:23:42.124
You... did you come here
on holiday?

01:23:42.161 --> 01:23:44.459
You think you've come
to Egypt on leave?

01:23:44.497 --> 01:23:45.987
Look at those buttons... filthy.

01:23:46.032 --> 01:23:47.693
Look at this. Disgraceful.

01:23:47.733 --> 01:23:49.132
What would Her Majesty say?

01:23:49.168 --> 01:23:50.863
You there, stand up.

01:23:50.903 --> 01:23:53.872
I don't say
it isn't necessary, sir...

01:23:53.906 --> 01:23:55.840
but we've been in Egypt
for six weeks now...

01:23:55.875 --> 01:23:58.605
and the Nile is falling.

01:23:58.644 --> 01:24:00.942
What I feel I must point out...

01:24:00.980 --> 01:24:03.380
is that the fall of the Nile
in Khartoum...

01:24:03.416 --> 01:24:06.317
comes two months earlier
than here in Cairo.

01:24:06.352 --> 01:24:08.616
And that when the Nile
has fallen sufficiently...

01:24:08.654 --> 01:24:10.588
Khartoum will be defenseless.

01:24:10.623 --> 01:24:13.524
Thank you, Colonel Stewart.

01:24:13.559 --> 01:24:16.027
But you know as well as I do...

01:24:16.062 --> 01:24:18.360
that men who have not been
fully conditioned...

01:24:18.397 --> 01:24:20.524
to the tropical climate
simply cannot fight.

01:24:20.566 --> 01:24:23.729
They'll die... by the platoons,
by the company.

01:24:23.769 --> 01:24:26.704
I agree, sir,
but couldn't you send ahead...

01:24:26.739 --> 01:24:31.005
a detachment
of your best-conditioned men?

01:24:31.043 --> 01:24:33.307
No, Stewart.

01:24:33.346 --> 01:24:34.938
I'm sorry.

01:24:36.215 --> 01:24:38.445
Excuse me.

01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:43.588
Don't be too hard on Wolseley.

01:24:43.623 --> 01:24:45.215
You haven't seen
his instructions yet.

01:24:45.257 --> 01:24:47.122
I was there.
He's to relieve Khartoum.

01:24:47.159 --> 01:24:49.059
Colonel, I've seen the orders.

01:24:49.095 --> 01:24:52.690
He's to bring out Gordon.
There's no mention of Khartoum.

01:24:52.732 --> 01:24:54.324
Wolseley knows.

01:24:54.367 --> 01:24:58.235
He's to proceed up the Nile
as slowly as possible.

01:24:58.270 --> 01:25:01.865
He'll move up to Wadi Halfa
shortly, yes, but he knows.

01:25:01.907 --> 01:25:04.842
He's to give Gordon every
chance at the last minute...

01:25:04.877 --> 01:25:07.141
to come out by his own choice.

01:25:07.179 --> 01:25:08.942
But Gordon won't come out.

01:25:08.981 --> 01:25:10.710
You know it.
I now know it.

01:25:10.750 --> 01:25:12.240
I'm sure
that Wolseley knows it.

01:25:12.284 --> 01:25:14.343
They've been friends always.
That's why I say...

01:25:14.387 --> 01:25:15.877
don't be too hard on him.

01:25:15.921 --> 01:25:18.515
It's the government
that's unconvinced.

01:25:20.526 --> 01:25:24.326
I can well understand why you
haven't told me this before.

01:25:24.363 --> 01:25:26.297
Why do you tell me now?

01:25:26.332 --> 01:25:27.856
Because it's on the cards,
Colonel...

01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:30.698
that this expedition
will be too late.

01:25:30.736 --> 01:25:32.567
Gordon should come out.

01:25:32.605 --> 01:25:35.506
There's no one to tell him
but you.

01:25:58.698 --> 01:26:01.030
Didn't he say where
they're mounting them?

01:26:01.067 --> 01:26:02.500
He does not know, Excellency.

01:26:02.535 --> 01:26:05.299
He saw the guns arriving,
that is all.

01:26:13.679 --> 01:26:16.477
You were Gladstone's gesture
last year.

01:26:16.515 --> 01:26:18.449
This year, it's Wolseley.

01:26:19.652 --> 01:26:22.018
Sir, I failed.

01:26:22.054 --> 01:26:24.887
I thought
I'd made it clear to them...

01:26:24.924 --> 01:26:26.892
that you'd never come out.

01:26:26.926 --> 01:26:29.656
- I didn't.
- You probably did.

01:26:29.695 --> 01:26:32.323
Gladstone's a gambler.
He's gambling.

01:26:32.364 --> 01:26:34.457
No, they all think
you should come out.

01:26:34.500 --> 01:26:36.365
So do I.

01:26:41.307 --> 01:26:43.138
Sir...

01:26:43.175 --> 01:26:46.702
what's the absolute limit
of time we can hold out here?

01:26:46.746 --> 01:26:48.441
I don't know.

01:26:48.481 --> 01:26:53.214
The Mahdi's brought up the guns
he captured from Hicks.

01:26:53.252 --> 01:26:55.743
That means he'll start
a bombardment.

01:26:57.289 --> 01:26:59.621
- How low is the ditch?
- It's low.

01:26:59.658 --> 01:27:01.888
And the news'll be
all over town by morning...

01:27:01.927 --> 01:27:04.623
the steamer arrived and no army.

01:27:04.663 --> 01:27:07.257
There'll be a panic.

01:27:07.299 --> 01:27:09.893
Sir, you haven't got a chance.

01:27:09.935 --> 01:27:12.165
I haven't got a choice.

01:27:12.204 --> 01:27:15.230
If Wolseley's orders are to save
only me and not Khartoum...

01:27:15.274 --> 01:27:16.764
I'm left with no choice.

01:27:16.809 --> 01:27:18.800
How could I leave? Tell me.

01:27:20.446 --> 01:27:24.576
What purpose is served
if Wolseley's too late...

01:27:24.617 --> 01:27:26.642
and Mahdi attacks?

01:27:26.685 --> 01:27:30.348
There are worse ways to die.
Many.

01:27:30.389 --> 01:27:32.584
That's the essence of it,
I suppose.

01:27:32.625 --> 01:27:35.185
Every man has a final weapon...

01:27:35.227 --> 01:27:38.993
his life... and if he's
afraid of losing it...

01:27:39.031 --> 01:27:41.556
he throws that weapon away.

01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:44.228
That's what they
can't quite grasp...

01:27:44.270 --> 01:27:47.637
that I'm not really afraid.

01:27:47.673 --> 01:27:51.507
And that's what they must
understand, isn't it?

01:27:52.645 --> 01:27:56.547
No one can make them
understand it except me.

01:27:58.450 --> 01:28:01.214
You must be tired.

01:28:01.253 --> 01:28:05.087
Meet me at the dock
tomorrow, early.

01:28:05.124 --> 01:28:06.318
Good night.

01:28:10.496 --> 01:28:12.487
Good night, sir.

01:28:54.306 --> 01:28:56.467
To get her through the blockade,
we'll have to armor the rail...

01:28:56.508 --> 01:28:59.341
set up troop guns here,
another one up forward.

01:28:59.378 --> 01:29:02.313
We'll carry the extra fuel
behind in a couple of luggers.

01:29:02.348 --> 01:29:04.839
I want every European
in Khartoum on this boat...

01:29:04.884 --> 01:29:07.079
the wives, children,
counsels, too...

01:29:07.119 --> 01:29:08.643
Frank Power and Herbin...

01:29:08.687 --> 01:29:11.485
and every Egyptian civilian
you can stack on board.

01:29:11.523 --> 01:29:13.081
You must get them all out.

01:29:13.125 --> 01:29:17.562
You mean I go with them,
and you stay here?

01:29:17.596 --> 01:29:19.723
Khartoum is my problem.

01:29:19.765 --> 01:29:21.960
Getting these people out
is yours.

01:29:22.001 --> 01:29:26.097
How else can I convince London
that I will not leave?

01:29:26.138 --> 01:29:28.936
But you'll be completely alone.

01:29:28.974 --> 01:29:30.498
It's a gesture.

01:29:30.542 --> 01:29:34.034
Come, little lady.

01:29:34.079 --> 01:29:35.512
We'll take you back home.

01:29:35.547 --> 01:29:37.879
Mr. Gladstone must understand...

01:29:37.917 --> 01:29:41.114
that I am capable
of gestures, too.

01:29:43.088 --> 01:29:44.282
Hassan!

01:30:15.621 --> 01:30:20.854
I don't ask you to be unafraid,
simply to act unafraid.

01:30:33.205 --> 01:30:35.435
How are you going
to handle Khartoum...

01:30:35.474 --> 01:30:37.237
when the word gets around
that we're gone?

01:30:37.276 --> 01:30:38.834
How are you going
to handle Berber...

01:30:38.877 --> 01:30:41.675
if Mohammed al Khalia
has heavy guns?

01:30:41.714 --> 01:30:43.341
We sink.

01:30:43.382 --> 01:30:46.408
We'll both take our chances.

01:30:46.452 --> 01:30:48.682
There are several letters
in here...

01:30:48.721 --> 01:30:53.317
appeals to Her Majesty
the Queen, the Pope in Rome...

01:30:53.359 --> 01:30:55.190
the Sultan in Constantinople.

01:30:55.227 --> 01:30:57.354
They're all for public display.

01:30:57.396 --> 01:31:01.457
There's only one appeal
that matters... Wolseley.

01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:03.900
And through Wolseley,
Gladstone.

01:31:03.936 --> 01:31:07.838
Perhaps now
you can convince him.

01:31:07.873 --> 01:31:09.534
Get through.

01:31:09.575 --> 01:31:11.543
You'll get through.

01:31:14.580 --> 01:31:16.571
Good luck.

01:31:22.388 --> 01:31:24.720
Gordon Pasha,
we are ready to sail.

01:31:24.757 --> 01:31:26.691
Thank you, Hassan.

01:31:56.622 --> 01:31:58.920
Why didn't we go, Gordon Pasha?

01:31:58.957 --> 01:32:01.255
Why wasn't I on the boat,
Gordon Pasha?

01:32:01.293 --> 01:32:02.954
I should've gone on the boat.

01:32:26.418 --> 01:32:29.148
This is Metemmah.
We'll refuel.

01:32:29.188 --> 01:32:31.156
Beyond here,
the shore is held solidly...

01:32:31.190 --> 01:32:32.657
by Mahdi's tribesmen...

01:32:32.691 --> 01:32:34.818
so you better go ashore
and stretch your legs.

01:32:34.860 --> 01:32:36.293
Be your last chance.

01:32:36.328 --> 01:32:38.558
Firewood? We have no firewood.

01:32:38.597 --> 01:32:39.859
Well, trees.

01:32:39.898 --> 01:32:41.058
Trees? Do you see trees?

01:32:41.100 --> 01:32:43.159
Yes, a mile or two
from the town...

01:32:43.202 --> 01:32:44.999
and Egyptians
hanging from them...

01:32:45.037 --> 01:32:46.834
I need fuel.
Tear out the dock!

01:32:53.278 --> 01:32:55.337
Come on!

01:33:11.663 --> 01:33:13.631
This is all we have left?

01:33:13.665 --> 01:33:15.360
This is all we have left.

01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:18.733
Excellency, do not blame
the superintendent.

01:33:18.770 --> 01:33:21.000
Someone presented
orders for grain...

01:33:21.039 --> 01:33:23.337
with your forged signature
and seal.

01:33:23.375 --> 01:33:25.309
He sold it in the town
for profit.

01:33:25.344 --> 01:33:27.904
Find him.
He will be executed.

01:33:29.381 --> 01:33:31.315
For how long shall we eat?

01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:35.343
The garrison will eat
for about two weeks.

01:33:35.387 --> 01:33:37.082
The town...

01:33:37.122 --> 01:33:39.647
Requisition all stocks of grain
in the hands of merchants.

01:33:39.691 --> 01:33:40.988
There is little, Gordon Pasha.

01:33:41.026 --> 01:33:45.156
All privately-owned livestock,
donkeys, goats, camels.

01:33:58.644 --> 01:34:03.672
We ride beneath no more
desert stars, then.

01:34:03.715 --> 01:34:06.582
All things must end.

01:34:07.586 --> 01:34:09.417
Take him, too.

01:34:16.862 --> 01:34:18.625
We reach Berber
tomorrow morning.

01:34:18.664 --> 01:34:20.655
This is the main point
of blockade...

01:34:20.699 --> 01:34:22.690
so we'll be attacked
from both shores.

01:34:22.734 --> 01:34:23.996
If we get through...

01:34:24.036 --> 01:34:27.005
it'll be luck, discipline,
and surprise.

01:34:27.039 --> 01:34:29.007
Pray for surprise.

01:34:29.041 --> 01:34:32.238
And pray also
that Mohammed al Khalia...

01:34:32.277 --> 01:34:34.768
has no heavy guns.

01:34:42.454 --> 01:34:46.515
Can't we move any further from
the shore than this, Captain?

01:34:46.558 --> 01:34:47.786
I'm sorry, Stewart Pasha.

01:34:47.826 --> 01:34:50.226
We're already too close
to the sand bank.

01:35:27.466 --> 01:35:28.865
Full speed.

01:35:33.005 --> 01:35:34.563
Number one, fire!

01:35:37.042 --> 01:35:38.634
Number two, fire!

01:35:40.779 --> 01:35:41.973
Fire at will!

01:36:26.058 --> 01:36:28.117
They have no heavy guns.

01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:30.355
We'll make it.

01:36:39.705 --> 01:36:41.900
They're coming.

01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:57.013
Below.

01:37:41.133 --> 01:37:42.623
Salaam Malachim.

01:37:42.667 --> 01:37:44.294
Malachim Salaam.

01:37:46.405 --> 01:37:49.772
The Mahdi and l... we look at
each other across the river...

01:37:49.808 --> 01:37:51.605
we assault each other
with assurance.

01:37:51.643 --> 01:37:55.044
Mostly the assurance
that we're still here.

01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:57.446
I'm late. Forgive me.

01:37:57.482 --> 01:37:59.040
Where is the army?

01:38:01.686 --> 01:38:04.416
For whom do you speak,
Sheikh Osman?

01:38:04.456 --> 01:38:07.254
For myself,
for the leaders of our people.

01:38:11.096 --> 01:38:13.360
We do not come to you,
Gordon Pasha...

01:38:13.398 --> 01:38:14.831
with cries and wails...

01:38:14.866 --> 01:38:16.629
"Why did you not send us
down the river...

01:38:16.668 --> 01:38:17.828
"beyond the fringe of danger?"

01:38:17.869 --> 01:38:19.632
We are not of Egypt.

01:38:19.671 --> 01:38:21.468
We are Sudanese.

01:38:21.506 --> 01:38:23.269
And this is our country...

01:38:23.308 --> 01:38:26.243
and this is our people
within these walls.

01:38:26.278 --> 01:38:28.303
When does the army come?

01:38:29.414 --> 01:38:33.373
Good sirs, I can only
tell you what I know.

01:38:33.418 --> 01:38:37.821
I sent Stewart Pasha downriver
to urge all possible haste.

01:38:37.856 --> 01:38:39.448
It has been ten days.

01:38:39.491 --> 01:38:42.927
He should have reached
Major Kitchener in five or six.

01:38:42.961 --> 01:38:44.622
It should not be long.

01:38:44.663 --> 01:38:46.062
How long?

01:38:47.732 --> 01:38:50.202
The Nile is low, Gordon Pasha.

01:38:50.202 --> 01:38:53.968
Bellies grow empty.
Men feed on fear.

01:38:54.005 --> 01:38:58.601
You do not have this fear
of death yourself, Excellency?

01:38:58.643 --> 01:39:01.168
It's a luxury
I've put behind me.

01:39:01.213 --> 01:39:04.842
You are exceptional.

01:39:04.883 --> 01:39:08.341
Gordon Pasha, when we accepted
your protection...

01:39:08.386 --> 01:39:10.354
for ourselves
and for our people...

01:39:10.388 --> 01:39:13.653
the Mahdi marked our souls
for damnation.

01:39:13.692 --> 01:39:14.886
We were not afraid.

01:39:14.926 --> 01:39:16.416
We trusted you.

01:39:16.461 --> 01:39:18.793
Did we choose correctly?

01:39:18.830 --> 01:39:21.162
You could not choose otherwise.

01:39:21.199 --> 01:39:23.292
It was against
your convictions.

01:39:23.335 --> 01:39:27.169
We now speak of life and death,
not convictions.

01:39:31.343 --> 01:39:34.506
Do you propose going over
to the Mahdi?

01:39:34.546 --> 01:39:36.446
We propose nothing.

01:39:36.481 --> 01:39:39.245
We ask, "Where is the army?"

01:39:39.284 --> 01:39:40.876
I don't know.

01:39:40.919 --> 01:39:44.013
I am wondering,
is there an army?

01:39:44.055 --> 01:39:47.547
Don't call me a liar!

01:39:47.592 --> 01:39:49.560
I beg of you...

01:39:49.594 --> 01:39:52.563
or I shall have
to lock you up.

01:39:52.597 --> 01:39:54.189
We are locked up now.

01:39:54.232 --> 01:39:56.325
Sheikh Osman...

01:39:56.368 --> 01:39:59.428
you are Khartoum's
most respected citizen.

01:39:59.471 --> 01:40:01.496
If you leave,
the city's spirit will break.

01:40:01.540 --> 01:40:02.871
It will surely fall.

01:40:02.908 --> 01:40:05.274
And you will be responsible
for its massacre.

01:40:05.310 --> 01:40:07.574
I have no choice but to stay.

01:40:07.612 --> 01:40:09.807
I repeat...
you have us locked in.

01:40:09.848 --> 01:40:12.715
- Gordon Pasha...
- Wait!

01:40:12.751 --> 01:40:17.188
If you were given the choice,
you still could not do this.

01:40:17.222 --> 01:40:19.713
You could not leave Khartoum.

01:40:19.758 --> 01:40:24.388
When one cannot choose,
one can never know.

01:40:24.429 --> 01:40:27.557
But you will understand,
will you not, Excellency...

01:40:27.599 --> 01:40:29.191
that there are those
among us...

01:40:29.234 --> 01:40:31.702
more afraid of death
than yourself.

01:40:31.736 --> 01:40:34.204
We cannot all be exceptional.

01:40:47.886 --> 01:40:50.855
Gordon Pasha, the police.

01:40:50.889 --> 01:40:53.551
They have the man
who stole the grain.

01:41:09.174 --> 01:41:12.974
Awaan, is this true?

01:41:21.219 --> 01:41:23.619
Tomorrow morning.

01:41:40.205 --> 01:41:44.369
Firing squad, take aim!

01:41:44.409 --> 01:41:45.774
Fire!

01:41:57.622 --> 01:42:00.386
As Governor General
of the Sudan...

01:42:00.425 --> 01:42:03.155
I issue the following
proclamation...

01:42:03.194 --> 01:42:06.960
at dawn tomorrow...

01:42:06.998 --> 01:42:11.458
the city gate to the south
will be opened.

01:42:11.503 --> 01:42:15.234
It will stand open
for three hours.

01:42:15.273 --> 01:42:19.505
All inhabitants of the city who
wish to leave...

01:42:19.544 --> 01:42:22.672
and seek the protection
of Mohammed Ahmed...

01:42:22.714 --> 01:42:25.114
known as the Mahdi...

01:42:25.150 --> 01:42:27.243
will be free to do so.

01:42:27.285 --> 01:42:32.086
No hindrance will be
placed in their way.

01:43:31.015 --> 01:43:32.414
I can't believe it.

01:43:32.450 --> 01:43:35.851
When did you say
the others passed through?

01:43:35.887 --> 01:43:37.946
A month ago.

01:43:49.434 --> 01:43:51.402
An armed steamer
called the Abbas...

01:43:51.436 --> 01:43:53.404
passed through Metemmah
downstream a month ago...

01:43:53.438 --> 01:43:54.871
and is since unreported.

01:43:54.906 --> 01:43:57.431
General Gordon had placed
all of Khartoum's Europeans...

01:43:57.475 --> 01:43:58.635
aboard the steamer...

01:43:58.676 --> 01:44:01.236
with instructions
to run the blockade.

01:44:01.279 --> 01:44:03.941
Colonel Stewart was in command.

01:44:03.982 --> 01:44:05.847
Stewart!

01:44:05.884 --> 01:44:10.116
Are you quite sure that
General Gordon wasn't on board?

01:44:10.155 --> 01:44:12.180
General Gordon
remained in Khartoum.

01:44:12.223 --> 01:44:15.886
Sir, the Nile is falling.

01:44:20.131 --> 01:44:22.622
What he's done is to make
a public announcement, sir...

01:44:22.667 --> 01:44:25.465
that cannot be misunderstood.

01:44:25.503 --> 01:44:27.130
He'll never leave.

01:44:27.172 --> 01:44:29.367
Gentlemen...

01:44:29.407 --> 01:44:31.307
if you please.

01:44:31.342 --> 01:44:34.072
We move instantly on Khartoum.

01:44:34.112 --> 01:44:36.137
Only the camel corps is ready.

01:44:36.181 --> 01:44:37.705
You, Sir Herbert,
will take command.

01:44:37.749 --> 01:44:39.080
I will stay here
with the main force...

01:44:39.117 --> 01:44:40.675
moving up as soon as possible.

01:44:40.718 --> 01:44:43.653
But you will go ahead
by water to Debba...

01:44:43.688 --> 01:44:45.212
make a formation there...

01:44:45.256 --> 01:44:47.383
and then take the desert
crossing to Metemmah...

01:44:47.425 --> 01:44:49.859
there to embark for Khartoum.

01:44:49.894 --> 01:44:52.260
Kitchener knows the route
and the wells.

01:44:52.297 --> 01:44:54.288
Move, gentlemen.

01:45:04.275 --> 01:45:05.503
Stand your camels.

01:45:06.945 --> 01:45:08.242
Mount!

01:45:14.018 --> 01:45:17.454
Advance in a column of sections
from the right.

01:45:17.488 --> 01:45:18.978
Walk!

01:46:11.910 --> 01:46:13.878
Did you pack the powder tightly?

01:46:13.912 --> 01:46:15.243
Yes, Gordon Pasha.

01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:17.111
All right, then.

01:46:17.148 --> 01:46:20.015
No, not too much sand
on the fuse, men.

01:46:20.051 --> 01:46:22.349
Give it plenty of air to burn.

01:46:29.560 --> 01:46:34.964
Now, you see, by firing this
pistol into the tinderbox...

01:46:34.999 --> 01:46:38.457
we can set off as many fuses
as we have running into them.

01:46:44.375 --> 01:46:46.900
Like this.

01:46:59.357 --> 01:47:01.154
Come along.

01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:04.458
- Call your men in.
- Right. Over here.

01:47:05.463 --> 01:47:07.055
Quickly.

01:47:23.414 --> 01:47:26.850
Good. Should be able to set off
about twenty fuses...

01:47:26.884 --> 01:47:28.317
from each tinderbox.

01:47:28.353 --> 01:47:30.014
I'll want at least 400 pots.

01:47:30.054 --> 01:47:31.783
The whole approach to the city
must be mined.

01:47:31.823 --> 01:47:33.415
Yes, Gordon Pasha.

01:48:11.763 --> 01:48:13.162
Halt!

01:48:16.300 --> 01:48:19.428
Form battle square.
Take up action stations.

01:48:19.470 --> 01:48:21.597
Down!

01:49:30.408 --> 01:49:32.774
By now the Christian soldiers
are on the river.

01:49:32.810 --> 01:49:35.176
- Attack, beloved one.
- Attack now, holy person.

01:49:35.213 --> 01:49:38.114
There is no more time.
It is the moment.

01:49:38.149 --> 01:49:42.176
Beloved one, give me the word.

01:49:42.220 --> 01:49:44.882
Do I make my preparations?

01:49:50.661 --> 01:49:53.653
Send me the one
who writes English words.

01:50:33.738 --> 01:50:36.002
- Wonderful!
- Gentlemen, what is this?

01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:37.200
Excellency!

01:50:37.241 --> 01:50:39.175
From Major Kitchener,
a message at last!

01:50:39.210 --> 01:50:42.008
British soldiers have crossed
the desert at Metemmah.

01:50:42.046 --> 01:50:44.037
They approach Khartoum
on the river!

01:50:46.717 --> 01:50:48.241
And Stewart Pasha?

01:50:48.286 --> 01:50:49.878
He's safe, Excellency.

01:50:49.921 --> 01:50:51.718
Their bus was delayed,
but it is safe.

01:50:51.756 --> 01:50:54.748
But the messenger says, so
you'll know the news is true...

01:50:54.792 --> 01:50:57.260
"Stewart Pasha still has
the ring you gave him."

01:50:58.262 --> 01:51:02.631
Give the man money,
something to eat.

01:51:05.303 --> 01:51:08.136
The messenger
from the Major Kitchener...

01:51:08.172 --> 01:51:10.470
eats and says thank you.

01:51:11.676 --> 01:51:13.143
He's very brave.

01:51:13.177 --> 01:51:16.146
I said to the messenger,
"Is it true that...

01:51:16.180 --> 01:51:18.148
"the Major Kitchener
has big dark eyes...

01:51:18.182 --> 01:51:19.809
"like flies in the night?"

01:51:19.850 --> 01:51:21.477
And he say it's true...

01:51:21.519 --> 01:51:24.488
that his eyes
are like black daggers...

01:51:24.522 --> 01:51:26.513
and before them,
all men tremble.

01:51:28.192 --> 01:51:33.357
The Major Kitchener has eyes
as blue as little flowers.

01:51:34.532 --> 01:51:35.829
The man was bragging.

01:51:35.866 --> 01:51:38.892
He'd never seen Kitchener.
He didn't want to say so.

01:51:38.936 --> 01:51:41.461
That's true, master.

01:51:43.207 --> 01:51:45.004
If he was lying...

01:51:45.042 --> 01:51:48.500
how could he know about that
ring I gave Stewart Pasha?

01:51:48.546 --> 01:51:51.777
Anyway, if the Mahdi wanted
to send me a false message...

01:51:51.816 --> 01:51:53.784
why would he say
the soldiers were coming?

01:51:53.818 --> 01:51:55.479
It makes no sense, Khaleel.

01:51:56.487 --> 01:51:58.284
That is right, master.

01:52:43.534 --> 01:52:46.992
Tell Abdullah he may make
his preparations.

01:52:47.038 --> 01:52:48.972
Then he must come to me.

01:53:48.032 --> 01:53:50.592
Where did you get this?

01:53:51.802 --> 01:53:55.260
The Mahdi asks you to come
to his tent in peace.

01:53:55.306 --> 01:53:58.605
A faluka awaits you
at the ivory trader's dock.

01:53:58.642 --> 01:54:04.512
I am his first Khalifa Abdullah,
and I remain here.

01:54:05.649 --> 01:54:07.640
I am your hostage.

01:54:09.153 --> 01:54:12.122
You will not regard it
as a discourtesy, I hope...

01:54:12.156 --> 01:54:14.147
if I lock you in.

01:54:30.174 --> 01:54:33.337
If I'm not back by dawn,
you'll be shot.

01:54:43.254 --> 01:54:46.155
Welcome, Gordon Pasha.

01:54:46.190 --> 01:54:47.782
Come in peace.

01:54:47.825 --> 01:54:50.817
How did this come to you?

01:54:52.129 --> 01:54:55.428
It came to you with
the greetings of your friend...

01:54:55.466 --> 01:54:58.799
far down the river,
Sheikh Ali lbrahim...

01:54:58.836 --> 01:55:00.565
of the Manasir people.

01:55:00.604 --> 01:55:03.266
Sheikh Ali lbrahim
has been induced...

01:55:03.307 --> 01:55:08.108
by my friend and great emir
Mohammed al Khalia...

01:55:08.145 --> 01:55:10.909
to acknowledge me
as the Expected One...

01:55:10.948 --> 01:55:13.041
the true Mahdi.

01:55:15.052 --> 01:55:16.349
He sends you assurance...

01:55:16.387 --> 01:55:19.379
that should you care
to proceed down the Nile...

01:55:19.423 --> 01:55:21.391
he will offer you safe passage.

01:55:21.425 --> 01:55:22.858
You are my guest.

01:55:22.893 --> 01:55:25.828
Why do you invite me here now?

01:55:25.863 --> 01:55:29.799
Because the Prophet Mohammed,
blessings be upon him...

01:55:29.834 --> 01:55:32.132
has appeared to me
in a vision...

01:55:32.169 --> 01:55:37.471
and instructed me to attack
Khartoum with fire and sword.

01:55:37.508 --> 01:55:41.968
20,000 angels will proceed
my men into battle.

01:55:42.012 --> 01:55:45.675
And terror will afflict
and subdue my enemies...

01:55:45.716 --> 01:55:50.154
as far as Mecca and Baghdad
and Constantinople...

01:55:50.154 --> 01:55:53.590
for all will know
what a truly great miracle...

01:55:53.624 --> 01:55:55.751
has been done
by my Lord Mohammed.

01:55:57.862 --> 01:56:04.097
I should prefer, Gordon Pasha,
that you leave Khartoum now.

01:56:04.134 --> 01:56:06.830
You are not my enemy.

01:56:06.871 --> 01:56:10.238
Why should your blood
sweeten the Nile?

01:56:11.809 --> 01:56:13.936
What you are saying is this...

01:56:13.978 --> 01:56:17.778
so long as I am in Khartoum
you dread to attack...

01:56:17.815 --> 01:56:20.682
for a British army is close,
and you know it well.

01:56:20.718 --> 01:56:23.687
A British army.

01:56:29.159 --> 01:56:30.456
The message.

01:56:30.494 --> 01:56:32.291
I sent the message.

01:56:33.297 --> 01:56:35.959
There is no British army.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:37.627
Your soldiers are in Egypt.

01:56:37.668 --> 01:56:42.298
They play cards,
drink the liquor, pursue women.

01:56:42.339 --> 01:56:45.604
Why would you send me
a false message?

01:56:45.643 --> 01:56:49.670
It is sometimes wise,
Gordon Pasha...

01:56:49.713 --> 01:56:52.739
to provide a man
with a few sunny hours...

01:56:52.783 --> 01:56:57.186
of fraudulent hope
so that when night comes...

01:56:57.221 --> 01:56:59.746
he will have a more
perfect inward vision...

01:56:59.790 --> 01:57:02.452
of the truth
of his hopelessness.

01:57:08.132 --> 01:57:10.100
I sent the message.

01:57:10.134 --> 01:57:13.262
There is no British army.

01:57:13.304 --> 01:57:15.295
You are alone.

01:57:16.307 --> 01:57:17.672
Quite alone.

01:57:27.651 --> 01:57:29.118
If this is true...

01:57:29.153 --> 01:57:32.122
then what difference
can it make to you...

01:57:32.156 --> 01:57:35.614
if one man leaves or stays?

01:57:35.659 --> 01:57:38.594
It is important to me.

01:57:38.629 --> 01:57:42.224
Please explain to me
the importance.

01:57:42.266 --> 01:57:44.234
Because I am a man of mercy!

01:57:44.268 --> 01:57:46.133
And I tell you go!

01:57:46.170 --> 01:57:49.333
Leave in safety. Now.

01:57:50.674 --> 01:57:52.642
You are not a man of mercy...

01:57:52.676 --> 01:57:57.136
for your visions have not
revealed to you what mercy is...

01:57:57.181 --> 01:57:59.672
and so why do you do this?

01:57:59.717 --> 01:58:01.981
You are not my enemy.

01:58:02.019 --> 01:58:05.113
But I am.

01:58:05.155 --> 01:58:07.282
You should understand,
Mohammed Ahmed...

01:58:07.324 --> 01:58:10.851
we are so alike, you and I.

01:58:12.863 --> 01:58:16.162
You would welcome death,
wouldn't you...

01:58:16.200 --> 01:58:18.668
if death could be
the servant of your life?

01:58:18.702 --> 01:58:20.567
Wouldn't you?

01:58:23.607 --> 01:58:24.835
I, too.

01:58:24.875 --> 01:58:28.174
If my life has a single point,
it's this...

01:58:28.212 --> 01:58:31.306
I've learned to be
unafraid of death...

01:58:31.348 --> 01:58:34.146
but never to be unafraid
of failure.

01:58:34.184 --> 01:58:37.017
If by the act
of surrendering my life...

01:58:37.054 --> 01:58:39.716
I can bring down
the world on your head...

01:58:39.757 --> 01:58:42.225
then it's an arrangement
I welcome.

01:58:43.560 --> 01:58:45.528
Do you understand?

01:58:45.562 --> 01:58:48.190
I'm sure you do.

01:58:48.232 --> 01:58:52.066
If you,
as a servant of your God...

01:58:52.102 --> 01:58:54.627
must use 100,000 warriors
to destroy me...

01:58:54.672 --> 01:58:57.698
a solitary servant of my God...

01:58:57.741 --> 01:59:01.973
then you whisper to me,
Mohammed Ahmed...

01:59:02.012 --> 01:59:05.641
who will be remembered
from Khartoum...

01:59:05.683 --> 01:59:07.776
your God or mine?

01:59:09.286 --> 01:59:16.317
But Gordon Pasha,
why should you be remembered?

01:59:16.360 --> 01:59:17.884
You are forgotten.

01:59:18.896 --> 01:59:20.158
Already.

01:59:23.200 --> 01:59:27.534
Is it possible
you still do not believe me?

01:59:34.712 --> 01:59:41.015
I do not believe any infidel,
even you, Gordon Pasha...

01:59:41.051 --> 01:59:45.647
can face a lonely death
without terror.

01:59:55.499 --> 01:59:58.832
Is it the Englishman
whose name was Frank Power?

02:00:09.246 --> 02:00:11.806
Is it the Frenchman
whose name was Herbin?

02:00:29.800 --> 02:00:32.030
Is it not your own ring?

02:00:42.780 --> 02:00:44.714
Do you leave Khartoum?

02:00:46.717 --> 02:00:49.185
I cannot leave Khartoum...

02:00:49.219 --> 02:00:51.619
Mohammed Ahmed...

02:00:51.655 --> 02:00:55.113
for I, too, perform miracles...

02:00:55.159 --> 02:00:57.821
and you shall witness one.

02:01:00.664 --> 02:01:06.864
While I may die of your miracle,
you will surely die of mine.

02:01:32.529 --> 02:01:35.930
Sir! The river!

02:01:58.522 --> 02:01:59.716
So.

02:02:01.158 --> 02:02:02.750
Here we are.

02:02:12.169 --> 02:02:13.898
All right, then, gentlemen.

02:03:07.190 --> 02:03:08.589
Fire!

02:03:50.300 --> 02:03:51.790
Get back!

02:04:15.225 --> 02:04:16.487
Fire one!

02:06:53.450 --> 02:06:54.644
Well, Khaleel.

02:08:28.245 --> 02:08:30.042
Take it away!

02:08:31.715 --> 02:08:33.512
That is Abdullah.

02:08:35.218 --> 02:08:37.209
I forbade it.

02:08:51.167 --> 02:08:54.466
The relief came two days late.

02:08:54.504 --> 02:08:56.131
Two days!

02:08:56.172 --> 02:09:00.131
And for fifteen years,
the Sudanese paid the price...

02:09:00.176 --> 02:09:04.977
with pestilence and famine,
the British with shame and war.

02:09:05.015 --> 02:09:09.315
Within months after Gordon died,
the Mahdi died.

02:09:09.352 --> 02:09:12.150
Why, we shall never know.

02:09:12.188 --> 02:09:15.157
Gordon rests
in his beloved Sudan.

02:09:15.191 --> 02:09:19.491
We cannot tell how long
his memory will live...

02:09:19.529 --> 02:09:22.157
but there is this...

02:09:22.198 --> 02:09:25.656
"A world with no room
for the Gordons...

02:09:25.702 --> 02:09:29.695
"is a world that will
return to the sands."
