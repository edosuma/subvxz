WEBVTT

00:02.400 --> 00:05.631
Hey, Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

00:10.400 --> 00:12.709
Miss Chambers,
can I ask you something?

00:12.880 --> 00:14.074
You're a girl, right?

00:14.240 --> 00:16.276
Well, I'm a woman.

00:16.440 --> 00:18.192
Well, that's close enough.

00:18.360 --> 00:19.839
You see, in about five minutes

00:20.000 --> 00:22.673
I'm going out on my first date
with a city girl,

00:22.840 --> 00:24.637
and I'm really nervous about it.

00:24.800 --> 00:26.597
You know, I'm afraid I might
get tongue-tied

00:26.760 --> 00:29.513
and make a fool of myself.

00:30.160 --> 00:33.994
I don't want that to get in the way
of me picking up the babes.

00:35.360 --> 00:37.032
Et tu, Woody?

00:37.200 --> 00:39.350
After only a few months
here at Cheers,

00:39.520 --> 00:42.080
you're starting to talk
like the other reprobates.

00:42.280 --> 00:45.317
Well, thanks, Miss Chambers,
but, you know...

00:46.240 --> 00:50.028
...that's not enough. I wanna be
smooth with the ladies like Sam.

00:50.480 --> 00:53.313
Well, I think I can help you out.
Have a seat.

00:53.800 --> 00:57.031
A good conversationalist
is usually a good listener.

00:57.240 --> 01:00.755
I've found that people love
to talk about themselves.

01:00.920 --> 01:02.592
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

01:02.760 --> 01:06.594
People have an endless fascination
with their own little world.

01:06.760 --> 01:09.399
It's an observation I made
as a small child,

01:09.560 --> 01:11.551
although I've never understood
why it holds true.

01:11.760 --> 01:15.639
I, myself, have always found many
more interesting topics to talk about.

01:15.800 --> 01:20.590
Of course, I've always made it a point
to broaden my horizons.

01:20.800 --> 01:22.552
As a matter of fact,

01:22.720 --> 01:25.792
I was reading the New York Times
at the age of 4.

01:26.200 --> 01:28.998
And from then, on to the classics.

01:29.160 --> 01:32.835
Of course, it caused some hardships
as a youngster,

01:33.000 --> 01:36.913
always being far and away
the brightest in the class.

01:37.080 --> 01:38.991
Usually, the brightest in the class

01:39.160 --> 01:44.598
is regarded as some sort of
a pimply faced egghead.

01:45.680 --> 01:48.638
I'm sorry, Clifford,
what was your question again?

01:50.000 --> 01:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:04.040 --> 03:06.679
Boy, just when you think
you can't get any older,

03:06.840 --> 03:08.239
you go and read the paper.

03:08.400 --> 03:10.277
- Why? What happened?
- Look at this.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.670
There's gonna be a reunion
of The Boston Boppers.

03:12.840 --> 03:14.512
Oh, my goodness. Look at that.

03:14.680 --> 03:17.148
- Who are The Boston Boppers?
- It's not a who, it's a what.

03:17.320 --> 03:19.197
Like you.

03:19.880 --> 03:22.110
It was a local TV show,
kind of like American Bandstand.

03:22.280 --> 03:24.271
- Carla used to dance on it.
- Oh, yeah.

03:24.440 --> 03:26.431
I danced my way
into New England's heart.

03:26.600 --> 03:28.477
Till they made up that stupid rule.

03:28.680 --> 03:29.908
What rule's that?

03:30.160 --> 03:34.995
The one that said that pregnant
16-year-olds can't Hully Gully on TV.

03:35.480 --> 03:38.119
Those were repressive times.

03:38.280 --> 03:41.033
Well, you must be very excited
about the reunion, Carla.

03:41.200 --> 03:42.315
I'm not going.

03:42.520 --> 03:44.351
Oh, how come?
I thought you loved that place.

03:44.560 --> 03:46.039
I did love it.

03:46.200 --> 03:49.078
But Nick was my dance partner.

03:49.280 --> 03:51.874
That was before
we had to get married.

03:52.040 --> 03:55.237
Boy, they sure have
tough dance laws up here.

03:56.720 --> 03:59.473
Wipe that table off there,
will you, Woody?

03:59.640 --> 04:01.631
We were a great team.

04:02.160 --> 04:04.628
We really got along
when we were dancing.

04:04.800 --> 04:07.997
And when we were dancing,
if you know what I mean.

04:08.160 --> 04:11.038
Yes, it's frighteningly clear.

04:11.480 --> 04:13.675
Well, why don't you just ask Nick
if he wants to go?

04:13.840 --> 04:15.034
Forget it.

04:15.240 --> 04:17.435
Oh, come on. You're not gonna
pass up all that fun

04:17.600 --> 04:19.591
just for a little pride, are you?

04:19.760 --> 04:21.113
It's not only fun.

04:21.480 --> 04:25.155
There's a chance to win 500 bucks
and a trip to Hawaii

04:25.320 --> 04:27.515
in that dance contest.
And we could do it.

04:27.720 --> 04:30.439
- Then what--?
- There's no way I'd call and ask him.

04:30.880 --> 04:35.510
And I really don't want anyone else
getting any crazy ideas, like calling him

04:35.720 --> 04:42.717
in Atlantic City at 555-4397.

04:43.360 --> 04:44.713
Well, here I go,

04:44.880 --> 04:49.237
out of earshot in the poolroom
for about 1 5 minutes.

04:50.160 --> 04:52.071
Oh, Carla.

04:52.560 --> 04:56.030
Hey, I got an idea.

04:56.200 --> 04:58.350
Why don't one of us call Nick?

04:59.200 --> 05:00.952
That'd be a good idea.

05:01.120 --> 05:04.351
- Anybody know the area code?
- 609!

05:05.800 --> 05:07.313
Thank you.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.309
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

05:11.480 --> 05:12.674
How's life, Mr. Peterson?

05:12.880 --> 05:16.236
Oh, I look at it every once in a while
when I'm in the john.

05:17.280 --> 05:18.918
I didn't mean the magazine.

05:19.120 --> 05:20.792
Neither did l.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.589
- So how's that job-hunt going, Norm?
- Great.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.675
- Hey, you got one, huh?
- Yeah, well. No, no. Vera did.

05:29.680 --> 05:32.319
Boy, Normie, don't you feel
the least bit emasculated?

05:32.480 --> 05:33.674
I mean, isn't it gut-wrenching

05:33.840 --> 05:35.751
to watch your wife go off to work
every morning?

05:35.920 --> 05:38.718
It's gut-wrenching
to watch Vera do anything.

05:47.120 --> 05:49.031
- Who are you?
- I'm Woody Boyd.

05:49.240 --> 05:51.196
Big deal.

05:51.360 --> 05:53.476
Where--? Where is everybody?

05:54.040 --> 05:56.395
Oh, there's those two bozos.

05:57.480 --> 06:00.358
Nick, Loretta.

06:00.800 --> 06:02.358
Hello, sweetcakes.

06:02.520 --> 06:04.476
You been thinking about me?

06:04.640 --> 06:07.438
Only during flea-and-tick season.

06:08.520 --> 06:11.637
Yeah? Well, in my neighbourhood,
that's all year round.

06:12.120 --> 06:14.350
I'm sure it is.

06:14.520 --> 06:15.748
- Hey, Nick.
- Sam.

06:15.920 --> 06:17.592
- Hi, Loretta.
- Hello.

06:17.800 --> 06:19.870
- Excuse me. Glad you made it.
- Of course I made it.

06:20.040 --> 06:21.393
Anytime Carla needs a favour,

06:21.560 --> 06:23.915
and I can benefit financially,
and you send me the bus fare,

06:24.080 --> 06:25.069
I'm there.

06:25.720 --> 06:27.438
Hey, that's quite a testimonial.

06:27.640 --> 06:31.269
So how you doing?
You still in the TV-repair business?

06:31.480 --> 06:34.472
That's a sideline now.
I'm into bigger and better things.

06:34.680 --> 06:36.193
What do you got there?

06:36.960 --> 06:40.748
"Nick's Talent Emporium,
Hi-Class Talent for Less.

06:40.920 --> 06:42.592
Nick Tortelli, Talent Manager."

06:42.760 --> 06:44.034
Well, I'll be darned.

06:44.200 --> 06:45.918
I only got one.

06:49.280 --> 06:50.998
Nick's managing my career now.

06:51.160 --> 06:53.515
Oh, yeah? You still singing
with the Grinning Americans?

06:53.680 --> 06:55.352
Boy, I love that group.

06:55.560 --> 06:57.471
Oh, step into the '80s.

06:59.320 --> 07:02.676
The Grinning Americans
are so passÃ© it's laughable.

07:02.840 --> 07:05.513
I'm with the Lemon Sisters.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.069
The Lemon Sisters?

07:07.240 --> 07:09.549
Yeah, it's Loretta
and two other dames.

07:09.720 --> 07:10.948
I thought up the name.

07:11.120 --> 07:13.714
Well, don't people confuse you
with the Lennon Sisters?

07:13.920 --> 07:15.239
I don't know.

07:15.400 --> 07:18.392
Do they throw their drinks
at The Lennon Sisters?

07:20.600 --> 07:22.989
It's pure coincidence
that the names sound alike.

07:23.160 --> 07:24.912
Besides, I got other people
on my roster.

07:25.080 --> 07:27.469
I also handle Wayne Newman.

07:30.080 --> 07:32.514
Ginger ale and a Scotch.

07:35.280 --> 07:40.673
Nick Tortelli? As I live and breathe,
what a surprise.

07:41.160 --> 07:42.229
What do you say, Carla?

07:42.400 --> 07:44.470
Are we gonna kill them
at that dance contest?

07:44.680 --> 07:47.114
You came here to go
to that dance contest with me?

07:47.280 --> 07:50.317
Sure. Yeah, I'm gonna win
that contest and go to Hawaii,

07:50.480 --> 07:52.596
where the girls wear grass skirts.

07:52.800 --> 07:56.315
And I'm planning on bringing
my hedge clippers.

07:57.040 --> 07:59.952
You gotta admit, the guy's a panic.

08:00.360 --> 08:02.430
I can't believe it. You guys
really used to rock out

08:02.600 --> 08:03.669
on The Boston Boppers, huh?

08:03.840 --> 08:05.956
Sure. We were the stars.
They couldn't stop us.

08:06.120 --> 08:08.031
Hey, you remember the host,
Floyd Panjeric?

08:08.200 --> 08:09.428
Yeah, what a dork.

08:09.920 --> 08:12.434
Remember that time we pantsed him
during the station break?

08:14.000 --> 08:15.592
It's gonna be great to see everybody.

08:15.760 --> 08:18.593
I just hope I can dance as good. I...

08:18.760 --> 08:22.070
- I'm a little rusty.
- Oh, no sweat. I'm in great shape.

08:22.280 --> 08:24.589
I'm glad to hear that, Carla,
but it takes two to tango.

08:24.760 --> 08:26.273
And if I'm rusty, we're nowhere.

08:26.480 --> 08:27.833
What's that supposed to mean?

08:28.040 --> 08:29.598
Look, I'm trying to be
a gentleman here.

08:29.760 --> 08:31.512
Everybody knew
who was more talented.

08:31.920 --> 08:34.558
- Yeah, me.
- Give me a break.

08:34.720 --> 08:36.073
I carried you.

08:36.280 --> 08:38.157
You carried me? I carried you.

08:38.360 --> 08:39.952
In your hat. I carried you!

08:40.159 --> 08:41.639
In your hat! I carried you!

08:41.799 --> 08:44.951
Carla, the fact is, I can go to the dance
with a monkey and win that contest.

08:45.120 --> 08:47.714
Oh, yeah? Who'd lead?

08:48.960 --> 08:49.995
That's it.

08:50.480 --> 08:53.517
If you were the last babe on earth,
I wouldn't dance with you.

08:53.680 --> 08:55.910
I got an idea. I'm gonna show you
how good a dancer I am.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.475
I'm gonna go with Loretta.

08:58.640 --> 09:01.632
Oh, Nicky, I'm honoured.

09:02.680 --> 09:04.398
We haven't danced
since our wedding.

09:04.560 --> 09:06.471
And we've never danced
fully clothed.

09:06.640 --> 09:08.710
There you go.

09:09.360 --> 09:13.035
It's me and Loretta.
And you, Carla, can eat dirt.

09:13.240 --> 09:14.468
That's what you think.

09:14.640 --> 09:17.598
I'm gonna get myself a new partner
and beat the pants off of you.

09:17.800 --> 09:20.109
Oh, yeah? Who are you gonna get?

09:25.760 --> 09:27.796
Eddie Csznyk.

09:29.920 --> 09:32.992
Eddie Csznyk, the Polish Prancer?

09:33.200 --> 09:34.394
That's right.

09:34.560 --> 09:36.073
He was always wanting
to dance with me,

09:36.240 --> 09:38.390
and I always turned him down
to go with you.

09:38.600 --> 09:41.068
Yeah, that was the last smart move
you ever made.

09:41.560 --> 09:44.313
Come on, Loretta, we're gonna
practice until our feet bleed.

09:44.480 --> 09:46.118
Okay.

09:46.680 --> 09:48.955
Bye, gang at Cheers.

09:54.840 --> 09:57.354
Hey, Carla, I saw him, I saw him.
He's dancing down the street.

09:57.520 --> 10:00.034
Boy, he's beautiful.
Makes Fred Astaire look like a gorilla.

10:00.240 --> 10:02.231
- You sure it's him?
- Yeah, I'm sure it's him.

10:02.400 --> 10:05.472
I called out, "Hey, Eddie Csznyk,"
and he waved back.

10:05.640 --> 10:09.155
This is it. My luck is finally changing.

10:10.640 --> 10:12.153
- Eddie!
- Carla!

10:12.320 --> 10:14.311
Check out my footwork.

10:15.600 --> 10:17.989
Eddie, your shoelace is un...

10:23.600 --> 10:25.397
...tied.

10:34.960 --> 10:37.349
Good luck, Carla.
I'm really sorry about this.

10:37.560 --> 10:41.030
- Knock them dead, kid.
- Yeah, yeah.

10:41.880 --> 10:45.509
Listen, mac, I'd put
a cervical collar on that knee.

10:45.680 --> 10:46.795
Give him...

10:46.960 --> 10:49.679
Give him about
30 milligrams of cc's, huh?

10:49.840 --> 10:50.909
Better make that 40.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.391
- What are you gonna do now?
- I don't know.

10:53.560 --> 10:55.949
I gotta get another partner.

10:56.120 --> 10:59.112
Does anybody here dance?

11:05.120 --> 11:06.155
I should've known better.

11:06.320 --> 11:07.878
The only time I've seen
any of you dance

11:08.040 --> 11:10.270
is when the restrooms are crowded.

11:11.480 --> 11:13.277
Sam?

11:14.000 --> 11:16.639
- Why don't you help her out.
- What are you talking about?

11:16.800 --> 11:19.553
Oh, you know very well
what I'm talking about.

11:19.720 --> 11:20.709
You're a great dancer.

11:20.880 --> 11:23.030
You won that trophy
at our ballroom-dancing class.

11:23.200 --> 11:25.111
Don't, don't...

11:26.040 --> 11:28.474
The fact that you talked me into
taking that stupid class

11:28.640 --> 11:29.914
is embarrassing enough.

11:30.120 --> 11:32.429
- Sam, are you going to help Carla?
- No, I'm not.

11:32.600 --> 11:33.589
- Why not?
- I am a jock.

11:33.760 --> 11:34.909
I've got an image to protect.

11:35.080 --> 11:38.152
I don't want people thinking I'm too
graceful, if you know what I mean.

11:38.320 --> 11:40.038
There's nothing wrong
with being graceful.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.758
I'm not worried
about being graceful.

11:41.960 --> 11:44.269
I'm worried about being too graceful.

11:44.480 --> 11:47.836
It's not like you're being asked
to perform Swan Lake in a tutu.

11:48.880 --> 11:50.871
Why did that particular image
come to mind?

11:51.360 --> 11:52.588
Sam, please.

11:52.760 --> 11:56.435
Baryshnikov is graceful,
and he's one of the sexiest men alive.

11:56.640 --> 11:57.834
Oh, come on. Barysh...

11:58.000 --> 11:59.991
We all know why women
go for Baryshnikov.

12:00.160 --> 12:02.594
- Oh, and why is that?
- Well, because of what he wears.

12:02.760 --> 12:05.320
I mean, those tights
have no secrets.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.474
Don't believe everything you see,
Sammy.

12:11.480 --> 12:14.278
You know, I think he's padded.

12:15.440 --> 12:17.476
Probably orders it
from that catalogue.

12:17.960 --> 12:19.871
What catalogue?

12:25.840 --> 12:28.479
Well, I heard some guys talking.

12:32.880 --> 12:35.269
Well, no luck back there either.

12:36.160 --> 12:38.913
Well, I can still take
the honourable way out.

12:39.120 --> 12:41.315
I'm going home to burn my feet
on the radiator.

12:41.480 --> 12:43.152
No, no, Carla.
Carla, come here. Come here.

12:43.320 --> 12:45.914
Wait. Let's see if we can...

12:46.080 --> 12:48.514
...do something here.

12:52.880 --> 12:54.916
Sammy.

12:57.840 --> 12:59.796
You're graceful.

13:15.440 --> 13:17.158
Carla.

13:17.320 --> 13:19.550
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

13:19.720 --> 13:22.553
- Cheryl, is that you?
- Yeah.

13:26.840 --> 13:29.229
We never liked each other
very much.

13:29.400 --> 13:30.435
Hey.

13:30.640 --> 13:31.914
What are you doing here with Sam?

13:32.080 --> 13:33.877
I thought you were coming
with Eddie Csznyk.

13:34.080 --> 13:36.594
Sam happens to be
a much better dancer.

13:36.760 --> 13:38.910
And he has the grace of a swan.

13:39.080 --> 13:40.229
Bull swan.

13:45.560 --> 13:47.790
Hi, kids.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.877
That's the way he started
every show.

13:53.440 --> 13:54.475
That's catchy.

13:55.440 --> 13:58.000
A lot of great years,
and a lot of great music,

13:58.160 --> 14:01.311
and a lot of grey hairs
have gone by.

14:03.680 --> 14:05.636
But you know what?
Out of all the music,

14:05.800 --> 14:07.597
I think our music
was the best music.

14:07.760 --> 14:09.796
- What do you say?
- You're a lame-o!

14:13.040 --> 14:16.794
Oh, you kids. Spunky as ever.

14:17.160 --> 14:19.515
But we're gonna have
a lot of fun tonight.

14:19.680 --> 14:20.999
Hey, I got an idea.

14:21.160 --> 14:23.469
Why don't we see
how far we've all come

14:23.640 --> 14:25.995
since the old Boston Boppers days?

14:26.160 --> 14:28.310
Tell us the person
you most admired then

14:28.480 --> 14:30.072
and the person
you most admire now.

14:30.720 --> 14:33.553
I'm Cheryl Koski from Brockton.

14:33.720 --> 14:36.757
And back then, I guess the person
I admired the most

14:36.920 --> 14:38.990
was Frankie Avalon.

14:39.160 --> 14:42.038
- And now?
- Now I'd have to say...

14:42.200 --> 14:44.111
...Fabian.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.158
All right.

14:58.320 --> 14:59.878
All right.

15:00.040 --> 15:02.076
Now that you're warmed up,

15:02.280 --> 15:04.589
Iet's get down to what
you're all here for:

15:04.760 --> 15:08.070
a chance to dance your way
to Waikiki.

15:10.120 --> 15:11.348
The rules are simple.

15:11.520 --> 15:13.397
If the judges tap you, you're out.

15:13.840 --> 15:15.239
You know, Sammy,

15:15.400 --> 15:17.755
when Nick and I used to go
to these dance contests,

15:17.920 --> 15:21.151
we always used to spit
on each other's shoes for good luck.

15:24.280 --> 15:25.998
Well?

15:31.320 --> 15:33.356
You missed.

15:33.960 --> 15:36.155
I hope you dance
better than you spit.

15:37.040 --> 15:39.838
Here we go with "Tutti-Frutti."

16:16.520 --> 16:19.273
Well, I'm sorry, kids. You're out.

16:25.160 --> 16:27.879
- Oh, come on, man!
- Hey, you stupid...

16:39.440 --> 16:41.635
Hey, they suck swamp water too.

16:41.800 --> 16:44.519
We have our winners!

16:53.760 --> 16:55.990
Hold it a minute, Floyd.

16:57.320 --> 16:59.834
A great wrong is about to be done.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.877
You know me. I'm Nick Tortelli.

17:02.040 --> 17:05.828
High school class of '62, '63, '64.

17:07.839 --> 17:12.117
The reason I didn't win this contest
is because my partner stunk.

17:14.119 --> 17:16.588
And I refuse to leave
until I show you how it's done

17:16.760 --> 17:19.194
with my ex-lovely wife, Carla.

17:20.079 --> 17:21.752
Nicky.

17:25.200 --> 17:26.952
- Come on, Carla.
- Forget it, Nick.

17:29.080 --> 17:32.436
Floyd, "Unchained Melody."

18:40.280 --> 18:43.078
Well, guess it's just you and me.

18:44.120 --> 18:45.792
Beg your pardon?

18:46.320 --> 18:49.312
I'd like to do something with you
that'll make him sorry.

18:49.480 --> 18:51.835
And I don't mean dancing.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.195
Do you have a van?

18:55.840 --> 18:58.752
I don't really think you wanna do
something you're gonna regret later.

18:58.920 --> 19:01.388
Oh, yes, I do.
And I wanna do it right now.

19:01.560 --> 19:03.471
And I'm good too.

19:03.640 --> 19:06.837
Even though I don't like it very much.

19:08.920 --> 19:10.751
You're making too big
a deal out of this.

19:10.960 --> 19:12.871
I mean, it's just a dance.

19:13.280 --> 19:15.111
How good?

19:39.280 --> 19:41.874
Introducing the winner of
The Boston Boppers dance contest,

19:42.040 --> 19:43.519
Miss Carla Tortelli!

19:43.720 --> 19:45.790
Oh, yay! That's wonderful.

19:45.960 --> 19:48.599
- You two did it.
- Well, no, no.

19:48.760 --> 19:51.797
Actually, Carla and Nick won.

19:51.960 --> 19:54.520
I guess I just wasn't
graceful enough.

19:54.920 --> 19:56.672
Come on, Sammy.
You were plenty graceful.

19:56.880 --> 19:58.836
No, I wasn't.

19:59.040 --> 20:01.190
No, really. You should've seen
Carla and Nick out there.

20:01.360 --> 20:03.316
They were like Fred and Ethel.
Really.

20:06.800 --> 20:08.870
Yeah, it was a magical moment.

20:09.040 --> 20:11.679
You know, it was like
I was transported back in time.

20:11.880 --> 20:14.678
I wasn't a tired old woman
with six kids.

20:14.840 --> 20:18.196
I was a fresh young teenager
with two kids.

20:20.080 --> 20:21.672
Come on, you guys.
Let me drive you home.

20:21.840 --> 20:23.114
Oh, good.

20:23.320 --> 20:25.470
Sammy, I think I just wanna
sit here for a little while

20:25.640 --> 20:27.153
and bask in the glow.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.715
Relive the moment
and have a couple of belts.

20:29.880 --> 20:31.518
Yeah, enjoy.

20:31.680 --> 20:32.954
Thanks.

20:33.120 --> 20:35.156
Congratulations, Carla.

20:35.320 --> 20:36.878
Now, aren't you glad you went?

20:37.080 --> 20:39.230
I'll bet you looked great
out there on the dance floor.

20:39.400 --> 20:40.469
Yeah, I did, actually.

20:40.640 --> 20:43.996
You know, why don't you come by my
place, and I'll show you my Watusi?

20:44.160 --> 20:47.072
And then later on,
we can dance a little bit.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.152
On second thought,
I'm going to hitchhike.

20:49.320 --> 20:50.719
You meet a better class of people.

20:53.720 --> 20:57.599
My love, my darling

20:58.360 --> 21:02.512
I hunger for your touch

21:16.920 --> 21:20.310
- What are you doing here?
- I had to see you.

21:21.240 --> 21:22.832
Carla...

21:24.240 --> 21:25.958
...tonight...

21:26.120 --> 21:28.111
...was destiny.

21:30.040 --> 21:32.110
What are you talking about?

21:32.280 --> 21:35.352
It was destiny that Eddie Csznyk
fell down those stairs.

21:35.520 --> 21:39.798
And it was destiny that The Boppers
even had a reunion.

21:40.480 --> 21:44.473
And it was destiny
that we won the contest.

21:45.040 --> 21:47.474
When we were dancing
out on that floor tonight,

21:47.640 --> 21:49.392
we were like the only two
people on earth.

21:51.160 --> 21:54.596
I know we belong together,
and we always will.

21:55.200 --> 21:56.189
Come on, Nick.

21:56.360 --> 21:57.998
We're great when we're
on the dance floor,

21:58.160 --> 22:00.310
but when the music stops,
we stink on ice.

22:00.480 --> 22:03.119
No, no. We were meant
to be together.

22:03.520 --> 22:05.556
Carla, you know me.

22:05.760 --> 22:08.672
Look in my eyes and you'll know
I'll tell you the truth.

22:12.120 --> 22:13.792
- You're serious.
- Yeah.

22:14.280 --> 22:15.269
What are you saying?

22:15.480 --> 22:17.994
I'm saying I want you to go
to Hawaii with me tonight.

22:18.440 --> 22:19.759
Now.

22:19.920 --> 22:20.909
Please, Carla.

22:21.320 --> 22:23.311
Make this dream of mine come true.

22:25.120 --> 22:27.076
- Tonight was incredible.
- Yeah.

22:27.840 --> 22:30.400
- Wow, you and me in Hawaii.
- Yeah.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.955
- Palm trees.
- Palm trees.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.111
- Sipping mai tais on the beach.
- Yeah, mai tais.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.150
- lt'd be paradise.
- Yeah.

22:39.760 --> 22:41.079
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

22:41.240 --> 22:42.798
- What about Loretta?
- What about her?

22:42.960 --> 22:44.678
She's waiting for us at the airport.

22:55.280 --> 22:57.396
Is that a no?

22:58.305 --> 23:04.380
