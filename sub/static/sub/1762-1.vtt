00:21.939 --> 00:23.939
Boss. On my way back.

01:05.190 --> 01:07.401
Work! Work, horsey!

01:07.568 --> 01:09.568
Crap. Hold on there. Damn it!

01:10.320 --> 01:12.614
Hold on there, Terminator! Go!

01:12.781 --> 01:14.783
Come on!

01:16.159 --> 01:18.159
Damn it!

01:20.622 --> 01:22.622
Crap!

01:30.257 --> 01:32.551
Help. Call... an ambulance.

01:55.741 --> 01:59.077
Holy cow! Is this the
freaking Terminator?

02:41.995 --> 02:44.039
God damn!

03:50.105 --> 03:52.105
There're persuers!

04:18.466 --> 04:20.474
He Ying, accept the
imperial decree.

04:20.594 --> 04:23.408
I have been upright and
honest all my life.

04:24.306 --> 04:26.306
How would I do that?

05:49.641 --> 05:53.478
India, 1621 A.D.
(1ST YEAR OF THE TIANQI REIGN)

06:11.454 --> 06:14.296
Golden Wheel of Time is a
sacred object from Borneo.

06:14.416 --> 06:16.626
A Sindhu epic Ramayana says...

06:16.793 --> 06:21.344
5,000 years ago, Borneo Prince Raju
left his country to fight with devils.

06:21.464 --> 06:24.264
Before leaving, he
promised Princess Same...

06:24.384 --> 06:27.929
to come back safely when
the five stars aligned.

06:28.096 --> 06:32.142
But the war went on and on
and Raju missed the day,

06:32.309 --> 06:33.857
Sama thought Raju was
dead and killed herself.

06:33.977 --> 06:38.481
Raju knew the god Shiva loved
rainbow Datura flowers,

06:38.648 --> 06:42.282
he then took good care of the
plant and Shiva was touched.

06:42.402 --> 06:45.322
Shiva gave him "Golden
Wheel of Time",

06:45.488 --> 06:47.329
a time travel tool,

06:47.449 --> 06:51.119
so that he could go back in time

06:51.286 --> 06:53.460
and stop Sama from
killing herself.

06:53.580 --> 06:57.868
Golden Wheel of Time has been
passed down among human ever since.

07:04.007 --> 07:06.468
Golden Wheel takes
person back to

07:06.635 --> 07:09.179
the time when the
five stars aligned.

07:09.346 --> 07:13.141
The five stars aligning
connects the past with future.

07:13.433 --> 07:16.853
Turn Golden Wheel thrice
and it will self-destruct.

07:17.562 --> 07:20.357
The tool works for
three times only,

07:20.523 --> 07:24.152
rumor has it someone apart
from Raju has used it once.

07:25.320 --> 07:28.573
Thus, please advise
the Ming Emperor...

07:29.157 --> 07:31.868
to use the last shot wisely.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.458
What is it?

07:40.835 --> 07:43.088
It's called Linga in Sanskrit...

07:43.380 --> 07:46.007
believed to be Shiva's penis.

07:46.174 --> 07:46.721
Enormous penis?

07:46.841 --> 07:50.971
To activate Golden Wheel,
you need to insert Linga...

07:51.221 --> 07:53.306
and recite the secret mantra.

08:01.272 --> 08:04.985
Ian Kwai Fong, Hong
Kong, midnight.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.660
Ox-head! Horse-face!

08:58.038 --> 08:59.169
You bastards!

08:59.289 --> 09:01.969
Tell Death God that
it's not my time yet!

09:03.251 --> 09:05.251
You want to lock me away?

09:06.254 --> 09:08.254
Not that easy, Horse-face!

09:09.299 --> 09:12.552
What's your problem? I'm
just eating my noodles.

09:35.325 --> 09:39.662
May, don't go over!

09:40.997 --> 09:42.379
Don't bother him.

09:42.499 --> 09:44.499
Yeah.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.921
Royal bodyguard!

09:50.381 --> 09:54.427
Wing Lee Street,
Sheung Wan, midnight.

09:56.304 --> 09:58.144
(INDIAN)
Come on man, hurry up!

09:58.264 --> 10:01.064
(INDIAN) I'm on it right now,
why don't you do it yourself?

10:01.184 --> 10:02.315
(INDIAN)
I'm the boss,

10:02.435 --> 10:04.435
just do what I said.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.550
Yo, curry chicken! It's good.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.467
Milk tea, drink up!

10:49.023 --> 10:50.864
Stop running!

10:50.984 --> 10:52.490
Drop those manhole covers!

10:52.610 --> 10:54.610
Run!

11:08.793 --> 11:10.962
Officers under attack!

11:29.564 --> 11:31.733
Why are people nowadays so weak?

11:32.275 --> 11:35.491
Have martial art skills
failed to be handed down?

11:41.451 --> 11:43.461
Give me back my curry chicken!

11:43.870 --> 11:45.870
Freeze!

12:03.181 --> 12:05.181
Freeze!

12:12.357 --> 12:14.734
This gun is powerful!

12:25.954 --> 12:28.122
I've been waiting
for you, Niehu.

12:28.289 --> 12:30.433
Where've you been all this time?

12:30.708 --> 12:32.708
I'm starving.

12:33.878 --> 12:34.926
These are some serious boobies.

12:35.046 --> 12:35.552
Hey, I haven't read it yet!

12:35.672 --> 12:36.594
Let me read first.

12:36.714 --> 12:37.846
Your turn first again?

12:37.966 --> 12:39.389
You should give
precedence to the young.

12:39.509 --> 12:40.265
How about He Ying?

12:40.385 --> 12:41.516
Let's track him down tomorrow.

12:41.636 --> 12:43.768
Wow! This one is even better!
She's pantless!

12:43.888 --> 12:45.645
Help!

12:45.765 --> 12:47.765
Help!

12:55.358 --> 12:58.152
Hey, this way. Take
a seat over there.

12:58.319 --> 13:00.201
Mr. Bodyguard!

13:00.321 --> 13:05.159
I just bought you noodles.
Now I buy you a drink.

13:08.037 --> 13:10.873
All drinks on me tonight!

13:11.040 --> 13:13.040
Awesome! Thanks!

13:13.418 --> 13:14.382
Hey hero!

13:14.502 --> 13:17.051
It's so cool you kicked that guy's ass.
Isn't it?

13:17.171 --> 13:20.758
That jerk never pays for his drinks.
He deserves it.

13:20.925 --> 13:22.925
Bro...

13:23.344 --> 13:24.017
Later!

13:24.137 --> 13:26.137
Hey...

13:29.809 --> 13:31.819
People here are so licentious,

13:32.061 --> 13:34.272
they ought to be
drowned to death.

13:39.485 --> 13:42.238
Excuse me, where are we now?

13:42.405 --> 13:44.120
Ian Kwai Fong.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.955
What year is it then?

13:46.075 --> 13:47.123
Who's the Emperor?

13:47.243 --> 13:49.459
Why must you ask?
There's no emperor now.

13:49.579 --> 13:51.873
It's 2013.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.796
Let me tell you...

13:53.916 --> 13:55.965
You said you're from
Ming dynasty...

13:56.085 --> 13:58.229
After Ming dynasty,
there were...

13:59.756 --> 14:01.756
Ming Dynasty has fallen?

14:02.091 --> 14:04.761
And I've slept for 400 years?

14:09.432 --> 14:12.315
Young emperor never worked
hard and corruption abounded.

14:12.435 --> 14:16.773
Heavy taxes. Brutal oppression.

14:16.939 --> 14:20.490
It's just a matter of time before
rebels subvert the government.

14:20.610 --> 14:24.113
The late emperor had
been kind to me

14:24.280 --> 14:27.742
I failed to protect my country.
I pledge guilty.

14:27.950 --> 14:32.663
I failed to protect my country.
Guilty as hell.

14:33.956 --> 14:37.502
Shau Kei Wan, early morning.

16:03.504 --> 16:06.117
This well water tastes
salty and stinky.

16:09.260 --> 16:11.262
Wake up. A thief broke in!

16:11.429 --> 16:13.429
Wake up!

16:17.059 --> 16:18.691
He looks kind of familiar.

16:18.811 --> 16:22.231
Breakfast delivery! What
are you guys doing there?

16:22.398 --> 16:24.442
Look up! Up there!

16:24.775 --> 16:27.236
Ying? Why are you up there?

16:37.580 --> 16:40.124
Ying, stop it!

16:40.291 --> 16:41.839
I'm not the fat guy
you talked about!

16:41.959 --> 16:43.961
Damn you!

16:46.589 --> 16:50.743
India-China Border, 1621 A.D.
Winter (1ST YEAR OF TIANQI REIGN)

17:09.569 --> 17:11.118
He Ying, accept the
imperial decree.

17:11.239 --> 17:13.491
Hold it! Let's make this clear.

17:13.657 --> 17:16.499
He Ying, you conspired with Japanese
pirates. How could you let us down?

17:16.618 --> 17:18.126
When did I conspire
with Japanese pirates?

17:18.246 --> 17:21.797
You taught me sword fighting.
Now I return the favour.

17:24.460 --> 17:25.883
What are you doing?

17:26.002 --> 17:29.507
Ying, our brotherhood
ends here and now!

17:31.133 --> 17:33.474
Ying, you can't oppose
to the Emperor's order.

17:33.594 --> 17:36.609
I hate people colluding
with Japanese pirates.

17:44.647 --> 17:47.024
He Ying, accept the
imperial decree.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.867
By the mandate of heaven,
this Emperor decree hereby.

17:50.987 --> 17:56.576
He Ying, fourth-rank General of Royal
Bodyguards, failed my expectations...

17:56.784 --> 17:58.875
and conspired with
Japanese pirates...

17:58.995 --> 18:04.333
killing 76 lives in the minister
of justice, Master Du's family,

18:04.500 --> 18:06.544
by extremely brutal means.

18:07.003 --> 18:11.220
Now I strip him of power and office.
He will be handed for interrogation.

18:11.340 --> 18:14.468
Anyone who resists this
order will be killed.

18:14.677 --> 18:16.821
Hitherto, by the
Emperor himself.

18:17.847 --> 18:22.184
I have been upright and honest all my life.
How would I do that?

18:22.685 --> 18:24.192
You speak up!

18:24.312 --> 18:27.737
It's you who forced me to conspire
with the Japanese pirates.

18:27.857 --> 18:31.902
Damn you! You are clearly
framing me for treason!

18:33.404 --> 18:37.158
I have to meet his majesty and

18:37.450 --> 18:38.748
clear myself of the accusations.

18:38.868 --> 18:41.292
Treason gets all your close and
extended family members executed.

18:41.412 --> 18:43.461
His majesty is
sending a squad of

18:43.581 --> 18:46.917
elite soldiers to Taoyuan
Village for execution.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.629
Hahahau.

18:51.297 --> 18:54.967
Hahahau.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.484
The late Emperor in heaven...

19:14.278 --> 19:18.282
I, He Ying, can never let
innocent people be killed.

19:18.532 --> 19:20.532
Forgive me for my disrespect.

20:28.310 --> 20:31.981
That's how the they
got buried in snow.

20:32.148 --> 20:34.148
Did I miss anything? Ying?

20:34.483 --> 20:36.198
Like in "Back to the Future?"

20:36.318 --> 20:37.241
Chubby!

20:37.361 --> 20:38.826
Call me Slander.

20:38.946 --> 20:41.203
Mr. Slander, I was a bit
confused just now...

20:41.323 --> 20:42.413
and used more violence
than needed...

20:42.533 --> 20:44.533
You're forgiven.

20:46.704 --> 20:47.918
Liu Bang!

20:48.038 --> 20:49.920
I'll call Liu Bang for you.
He sure can help.

20:50.040 --> 20:51.881
I'll call his son Liu Bei.

20:52.001 --> 20:53.466
Who should I call then?

20:53.586 --> 20:55.051
Call Andy Lau.

20:55.171 --> 20:56.886
Girls, are you leaving me?

20:57.006 --> 20:59.341
Are you leaving just like that?

21:00.926 --> 21:03.053
He's so pathetic...

21:03.220 --> 21:04.644
and you can't use up all
this space yourself,

21:04.764 --> 21:06.932
why don't you let him stay?

21:08.726 --> 21:10.024
What's wrong with you?

21:10.144 --> 21:11.567
Did he crush your brain?

21:11.687 --> 21:14.607
He's a guy. How can
I let him stay?

21:16.442 --> 21:18.652
Mr. Slander.

21:19.695 --> 21:22.656
I sincerely thank you
for your hospitality,

21:22.823 --> 21:23.913
but it's getting late and

21:24.033 --> 21:26.327
I don't want to
take up your time.

21:26.535 --> 21:28.704
Miss May, I'll forever remember

21:29.371 --> 21:32.208
your kindness for
the lovely meal.

21:39.173 --> 21:41.173
Farewell.

21:41.842 --> 21:43.265
Ying, you're leaving
just like that?

21:43.385 --> 21:44.600
How can you go out in that look?

21:44.720 --> 21:45.267
What look?

21:45.387 --> 21:46.977
Your appearance of course.

21:47.097 --> 21:49.642
Causeway Bay, afternoon.

22:15.251 --> 22:17.461
Are you missing a
mirror at home?

22:17.711 --> 22:18.884
Stupid extras.

22:19.004 --> 22:21.053
Go to the TV station and ask
for Oprah if you want a job.

22:21.173 --> 22:23.173
Hmm.

22:23.342 --> 22:24.724
Young man, give me a minute
to discuss with you.

22:24.844 --> 22:25.433
What do you want?

22:25.553 --> 22:27.553
You bastards!

22:31.809 --> 22:35.938
I must learn martial art!

22:36.105 --> 22:37.737
Boss, you want to date a
martial artist this time?

22:37.857 --> 22:39.321
Damn!

22:39.441 --> 22:41.441
North Point, afternoon.

22:59.295 --> 23:01.761
They bid up the price 50 times
on that stupid dog head.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.881
I'm a rich man!

23:04.258 --> 23:06.015
12 million Euros.

23:06.135 --> 23:09.185
Transfer HK$48 million to Mr.
Tang's account immediately.

23:09.305 --> 23:10.352
Got it.

23:10.472 --> 23:13.856
Having a good partner is
everything in running a business.

23:13.976 --> 23:17.795
Ever since I worked with you,
I don't worry about a thing.

23:19.315 --> 23:21.692
By the way, let me ask you.

23:22.026 --> 23:24.074
Those three frozen
corpses last time...

23:24.194 --> 23:25.284
They were alive, right?

23:25.404 --> 23:27.448
Yes, they were!

23:27.698 --> 23:29.622
Kim the North Korean
wouldn't spend

23:29.742 --> 23:31.207
a fortune on them
if they weren't.

23:31.327 --> 23:34.208
He's so obsessed with
staying alive forever.

23:36.832 --> 23:38.832
But how did you know?

23:47.509 --> 23:49.183
The driver can't
keep his mouth shut.

23:49.303 --> 23:51.303
He told you, right?

23:51.722 --> 23:53.938
He only told me
after the accident.

23:54.058 --> 23:57.316
Not only did he tell you, but his
girlfriend as well after drunk!

23:57.436 --> 23:59.276
Ask him. How many
people knew about it?

23:59.396 --> 24:00.653
Ask!

24:00.773 --> 24:03.275
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

24:06.153 --> 24:10.977
You said it right. Having a good partner
is everything in doing business.

24:11.116 --> 24:13.461
So that I don't worry
about a thing.

24:17.164 --> 24:20.000
Your own problem.
Solve it yourself.

24:48.112 --> 24:50.591
Clean it up after him.
A gift for you.

24:52.783 --> 24:54.783
Thanks Boss.

25:09.008 --> 25:11.760
Chan, Elderly Home Director.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.152
Hey May, you're
looking hot tonight.

25:23.272 --> 25:25.272
You got a light?

25:26.525 --> 25:28.525
You shouldn't have done that.

25:32.281 --> 25:34.281
Hey! Youu.

25:50.090 --> 25:52.014
Miss May, you don't
have to thank me.

25:52.134 --> 25:56.138
I've accepted your
meal and I'm grateful.

25:56.305 --> 25:58.312
Last night you said
you've been harassed,

25:58.432 --> 26:01.935
that's why I came to
teach them a lesson.

26:03.270 --> 26:06.486
What the heck do you think
you're doing out here?

26:06.690 --> 26:09.485
Eh... Hi Boss, eh...
I don't know him.

26:09.693 --> 26:11.367
Hey you! Why did
you beat them up?

26:11.487 --> 26:12.660
I only strike their acupoints.

26:12.780 --> 26:14.907
Look. They're fine.

26:15.365 --> 26:16.455
Is he your friend?

26:16.575 --> 26:17.998
He's not my friend!

26:18.118 --> 26:20.751
No matter what, you two are
coming with me to settle this.

26:20.871 --> 26:24.221
I don't want everybody to
see us fighting out here.

26:24.833 --> 26:27.379
What did this foreigner
scold on about?

26:27.753 --> 26:30.506
Negotiation! Come on.

26:31.799 --> 26:33.884
Don't hit people anymore.

26:38.514 --> 26:41.016
Your boyfriend beat
up the bouncers.

26:41.767 --> 26:45.184
That'll make trouble and
it's not good for business.

26:45.938 --> 26:48.482
You have to pay them
to settle this.

26:50.692 --> 26:51.699
What did she want?

26:51.819 --> 26:54.029
Money! Idiot!

26:54.404 --> 26:56.286
What's "idiot?"

26:56.406 --> 26:58.406
Hush and let me handle it.

26:58.534 --> 26:59.999
He's your problem, deal with it.

27:00.119 --> 27:01.291
You can calm down a little bit.

27:01.411 --> 27:03.002
Calm? Calm the heck!

27:03.122 --> 27:04.920
You foreign pig! Cursing
others right from the start.

27:05.040 --> 27:05.838
So disrespectful!

27:05.958 --> 27:08.340
You manage your staff poorly and
let them bully a decent woman,

27:08.460 --> 27:10.342
and dare ask for compensation?

27:10.462 --> 27:11.385
I'll pay fOI' You-

27:11.505 --> 27:12.344
I pay for her.

27:12.464 --> 27:13.095
Really? You're so generous!

27:13.215 --> 27:14.596
Is this enough?

27:14.716 --> 27:16.598
What's this? You joking?

27:16.718 --> 27:19.096
You haven't seen it before?

27:19.304 --> 27:21.304
Okay. How about this?

27:21.807 --> 27:24.309
You must've seen gold before.

27:29.439 --> 27:30.446
Sir, here's your cash.

27:30.566 --> 27:32.566
Thank you very much.

27:34.695 --> 27:36.695
Here you go.

27:38.532 --> 27:41.498
I'll pass this to my boss.
And these are for you.

27:41.618 --> 27:43.459
Keep it safe. There are many
bad people in Hong Kong.

27:43.579 --> 27:44.793
Don't flash the dough.

27:44.913 --> 27:48.213
You gave me all this and
leaving yourself penniless?

27:48.333 --> 27:49.256
No, I still got plenty.

27:49.376 --> 27:50.507
Plenty?

27:50.627 --> 27:52.384
Look. Don't worry.

27:52.504 --> 27:53.719
How much have you got?

27:53.839 --> 27:55.554
Let's sell it all at once.

27:55.674 --> 27:58.515
There are many bad people in Hong Kong.
Don't flash it.

27:58.635 --> 27:59.641
Excuse me. I want these two
ingots in cash please.

27:59.761 --> 28:00.476
Stupid!

28:00.596 --> 28:02.596
Just one moment please.

28:03.724 --> 28:08.103
Sir, may I have the pleasure to
take a look at your Jade pendant?

28:12.566 --> 28:14.073
If the accrued 3 months payment
is not settled by tomorrow,

28:14.193 --> 28:17.159
we'd need your mother to vacate
our elderly home immediately.

28:17.279 --> 28:19.423
This ancient Jade
is gorgeous and

28:19.573 --> 28:21.371
the craftsmanship is exquisite.

28:21.491 --> 28:23.624
It's artisan jewelry
of Ming Dynasty.

28:23.744 --> 28:25.542
It's an honour to have seen it.

28:25.662 --> 28:27.628
Why don't you sell it as well?

28:27.748 --> 28:29.671
How much will you pay for it?

28:29.791 --> 28:32.794
Miss, you must be
kidding, right?

28:32.961 --> 28:34.176
How can shops like us afford it?

28:34.296 --> 28:36.178
Maybe Sotheby will
sell it for you.

28:36.298 --> 28:39.181
This Jade pendant is worth at
least tens of millions dollars.

28:39.301 --> 28:41.016
Tens of millions?

28:41.136 --> 28:43.136
To be honest,

28:43.263 --> 28:45.229
this Jade pendant was given
to me by the late Emperor,

28:45.349 --> 28:46.855
I'm not selling it for anything.

28:46.975 --> 28:47.689
Here's your cash, sir.

28:47.809 --> 28:48.524
Thank you so much.

28:48.644 --> 28:49.733
Thank you. Thank you.

28:49.853 --> 28:51.485
So long.

28:51.605 --> 28:54.900
Miss May, is there any
hotel around here?

28:55.400 --> 28:57.491
Why are you staying in a hotel?
You're treating me like a stranger!

28:57.611 --> 28:59.118
We're friends and you
should stay with me.

28:59.238 --> 29:02.588
Well, I accept then. I'm
afraid you wouldn't offer.

29:16.505 --> 29:18.220
Bring me some food.
Make it quick.

29:18.340 --> 29:20.819
(INDIAN) Go prepare
some curry dishes.

29:28.058 --> 29:31.520
Sao, these western
weapons are so powerful,

29:32.688 --> 29:36.024
we must fire before
our enemy does.

29:36.483 --> 29:39.486
Or else, even with our
strength and agility,

29:39.653 --> 29:42.870
we can't dodge it if shot
from within 3 meters away.

29:42.990 --> 29:44.990
What do you say?

29:47.202 --> 29:50.122
Let's use it on Ying.

29:50.289 --> 29:52.289
Boss.

29:58.380 --> 30:03.468
The curry... chicken
spaghetti here is not bad.

30:03.635 --> 30:08.181
It's spaghetti chicken curry.

30:08.640 --> 30:11.727
Spaghetti chicken curry?

30:11.893 --> 30:12.649
Yes yeah!

30:12.769 --> 30:13.275
Yeah?

30:13.395 --> 30:15.395
Yeah!

30:19.693 --> 30:21.283
Ask all our people
to find this man.

30:21.403 --> 30:23.572
(INDIAN) Everybody,
come with me.

30:23.739 --> 30:26.533
We must find this man.

30:28.577 --> 30:30.746
You'd sleep here from now on.

30:31.163 --> 30:33.587
Hong Kong has little land but many people.
Floor space is very expensive.

30:33.707 --> 30:36.298
I'll charge you a special
rate of HK$5,000 a night.

30:36.418 --> 30:37.841
That's fine.

30:37.961 --> 30:40.881
I slept outdoors in the army.

30:41.423 --> 30:44.051
Now I have a roof over my head,

30:44.217 --> 30:45.807
I'm eternally grateful.

30:45.927 --> 30:47.976
It's good that you make do with it.
Let me tell you.

30:48.096 --> 30:49.519
That's my room and
you can't go in.

30:49.639 --> 30:50.312
Of course.

30:50.432 --> 30:52.439
But feel free to use
all other spaces.

30:52.559 --> 30:53.941
Watch TV or a movie if you want.

30:54.061 --> 30:56.875
Just let me know if you
need anything else.

31:00.984 --> 31:03.278
I know you need money.

31:03.445 --> 31:05.118
But don't go too far.

31:05.238 --> 31:08.163
Don't scam him because he's
from Ming Dynasty, okay?

31:08.283 --> 31:09.581
That's not your business.

31:09.701 --> 31:12.292
All you have to do is to
stay here for the night.

31:12.412 --> 31:15.829
Who knows what he'd do at night.
Keep an eye on him.

31:22.631 --> 31:25.311
See? Don't even look
away for one second.

31:25.967 --> 31:30.222
It must be a modern
musical instrument.

31:31.181 --> 31:34.184
It sounds quite... dreamy.

31:34.810 --> 31:37.437
It is cutting-edge technology.

31:37.646 --> 31:39.569
An electronic keyboard.

31:39.689 --> 31:42.972
Miss May, so you like playing
musical instruments?

31:43.652 --> 31:45.867
But now it's just
here for decoration.

31:45.987 --> 31:49.079
I didn't put much effort when I was young.
Now that I'm old,

31:49.199 --> 31:51.832
I can't even move my fingers swiftly.
I guess I'll give up.

31:51.952 --> 31:54.913
I believe that, anyone
can do anything

31:55.163 --> 31:56.586
with insistence and faith.

31:56.706 --> 32:00.752
Ying, you said a truck
overturned and brought you here.

32:01.002 --> 32:04.177
I sought through all sources, but
I don't find this piece of news.

32:04.297 --> 32:05.178
News is...

32:05.298 --> 32:05.887
Yes?

32:06.007 --> 32:08.151
Information from our government.

32:09.010 --> 32:09.975
What's this?

32:10.095 --> 32:11.727
A tablet.

32:11.847 --> 32:14.980
Just swipe it with your finger.
You can almost find anything.

32:15.100 --> 32:16.356
What the heck.

32:16.476 --> 32:19.067
A small piece of metal that
tells the past and future,

32:19.187 --> 32:21.903
so much stronger than our
encyclopedia in Ming Dynasty.

32:22.023 --> 32:24.818
Can you find the clues
for me with it?

32:24.985 --> 32:26.985
Absolutely.

32:27.320 --> 32:28.702
There is no entry on
Tao Yuan Village.

32:28.822 --> 32:31.992
Let's search "Golden
Wheel of Time".

32:32.159 --> 32:34.041
Ying can go back to Ming
Dynasty if we find it.

32:34.161 --> 32:34.916
600d idea.

32:35.036 --> 32:35.917
Miss May, quick.

32:36.037 --> 32:37.252
Qkay...

32:37.372 --> 32:39.918
Nothing on Golden
Wheel of Time either.

32:42.210 --> 32:46.298
I guess Golden Wheel of Time was
buried in snow just like me.

32:46.631 --> 32:49.551
How about...
searching your name?

32:50.135 --> 32:52.135
Sure.

32:56.725 --> 33:00.228
How could they write such a thing?
It's all nonsense.

33:00.770 --> 33:04.065
Those bastards!

33:04.900 --> 33:06.900
Hey. Come and read.

33:08.069 --> 33:10.452
He Ying colluded with
Japanese pirates

33:10.572 --> 33:12.079
in the 2nd year of
the Tianqi Reign.

33:12.199 --> 33:14.539
His close and extended family members
were executed by the Emperor.

33:14.659 --> 33:17.078
The official historians
commented him

33:17.245 --> 33:18.919
as the most treacherous
official of Tianqi Reign.

33:19.039 --> 33:20.128
What should we do?

33:20.248 --> 33:24.085
In Wind-Wave pavilion;
Yue Fei was framed.

33:24.252 --> 33:29.424
Azalea wept in bloody tears; Sorrows
lingered on for thousand years.

33:35.764 --> 33:38.517
How ridiculous!

33:41.770 --> 33:44.439
I hope he's alright.

33:52.405 --> 33:54.955
Find a blacksmith and make this.
Understand?

33:55.075 --> 33:57.075
Okay.

33:58.787 --> 34:02.249
Sao, actually... could the
murderer be someone else?

34:02.541 --> 34:04.047
Impossible.

34:04.167 --> 34:06.713
There were only the
four of us at Du's.

34:07.963 --> 34:09.678
Chubby admitted his crime.

34:09.797 --> 34:13.684
The evidence was crystal clear.
There's nothing to discuss.

34:33.446 --> 34:36.074
Master Du, you invited
us here tonight.

34:36.241 --> 34:37.706
<i>Is there something
you want to discuss?</i>

34:37.826 --> 34:40.375
I got secret intelligence and
seized a bunch of letters

34:40.495 --> 34:42.639
written to the Japanese pirates.

34:42.789 --> 34:45.208
There must be a spy in the army,

34:45.833 --> 34:48.800
selling out our intelligence
to the Japanese pirates.

34:48.920 --> 34:53.341
If I find out who he is,
I must tear him to bits!

34:53.507 --> 34:55.507
I hate Japanese!

34:55.719 --> 34:59.889
Letters were not signed. But
we can find out who he is...

35:00.181 --> 35:03.018
if we compare the handwriting.

35:03.685 --> 35:06.187
Officers, General He, salute.

35:06.354 --> 35:08.111
How was it? Tell us.

35:08.231 --> 35:10.780
The money and food you
ordered will be sent to...

35:10.900 --> 35:12.324
Taoyuan Village tomorrow.

35:12.444 --> 35:14.654
Good. Well done.

35:19.701 --> 35:23.580
76 lives of Mr. Du's family
were killed that night,

35:23.830 --> 35:26.845
and He Ying left the
Capital the next morning.

35:28.043 --> 35:30.425
And the letters were
nowhere to be found.

35:30.545 --> 35:32.589
That's some evidence, huh?

35:35.425 --> 35:37.425
He Ying,

35:40.221 --> 35:42.557
I won't let you off the hook!

35:44.142 --> 35:46.603
Where's my spaghetti
chicken curry?

35:47.479 --> 35:49.564
Ms Kwok, we're so busy here.

35:50.065 --> 35:52.614
You don't answer calls or return messages.
Your cheques were bounced.

35:52.734 --> 35:54.533
It's very impolite.

35:54.653 --> 35:56.117
I'm terribly sorry...

35:56.237 --> 35:57.786
I know you care for your mum.

35:57.906 --> 36:00.330
But you should do it
within your means.

36:00.450 --> 36:03.197
If you need it, apply
for social security.

36:03.370 --> 36:05.418
Of course the homes
won't be of this class.

36:05.538 --> 36:08.213
The fourth wife of Mr. Ho came and
asked if she could send him here.

36:08.333 --> 36:10.423
I couldn't even
squeeze her a room.

36:10.543 --> 36:14.422
Director, please give
me one more chance.

36:14.589 --> 36:17.592
This will be the last time.
That's it.

36:18.093 --> 36:20.093
Thank you!

36:21.262 --> 36:23.890
Mum, you look gorgeous today.

36:26.434 --> 36:30.647
It gets cold these couple days.
Do you feel cold?

36:31.314 --> 36:33.400
Let me know if you do.

36:35.610 --> 36:38.488
I made your favourite
fish congee.

36:40.824 --> 36:44.202
You always made me fish
congee when I was little,

36:45.078 --> 36:47.163
now it's your turn to try mine.

36:48.081 --> 36:51.710
Watch out. It's hot. Ah...

36:51.876 --> 36:53.550
Open up! Ah...

36:53.670 --> 36:56.423
Once more.

36:58.800 --> 37:00.969
That's great!

37:02.846 --> 37:04.728
You raised me up
all by yourself.

37:04.848 --> 37:05.937
Taoyuan Village, 1621 A.D.
(1ST YEAR OF THE TIANQI REIGN)

37:06.057 --> 37:09.352
Doing needle work every
night which blinded you.

37:09.936 --> 37:12.402
You won't come with me to the
Capital even I begged you to.

37:12.522 --> 37:14.321
I don't know what else to say.

37:14.441 --> 37:17.485
Silly!

37:17.694 --> 37:20.243
All villagers and I
will be proud of you

37:20.363 --> 37:26.119
when you set for glorious
homecoming in the future.

37:50.685 --> 37:54.189
Let go of my mum! Let her go!

38:14.709 --> 38:16.508
Uncle Seven, why did you hit me?

38:16.628 --> 38:18.218
What? I didn't.

38:18.338 --> 38:21.508
Mum, you're talking!

38:22.550 --> 38:23.431
What happened?

38:23.551 --> 38:25.058
Your mother suffered from Yin-Yang
imbalance and crooked meridians.

38:25.178 --> 38:26.601
That's why she's unconscious.

38:26.721 --> 38:29.896
I just cleared the blockage in
energy and blood flow for her.

38:30.016 --> 38:32.399
She'd feel even better if I do
it to her a few more times.

38:32.519 --> 38:34.025
Thank you so much, please
do that again some times.

38:34.145 --> 38:36.145
Will do.

38:37.607 --> 38:41.319
Mum, remember me? It's May.

38:41.569 --> 38:45.156
No, I don't. I just remember
Uncle Seven stole my pig.

39:02.882 --> 39:04.882
Mother.

39:27.949 --> 39:30.206
In the name of
heaven and the moon,

39:30.326 --> 39:34.372
I, He Ying, swear by my
sword, despite all hardship,

39:34.956 --> 39:36.921
I must return to
the Ming Empire...

39:37.041 --> 39:39.127
to protect Taoyuan Village...

39:39.627 --> 39:43.131
and save my relatives
from being massacred.

39:43.339 --> 39:47.260
Breaking my vow, I must die
with a million wounds,

39:47.427 --> 39:49.427
without a proper grave.

39:52.724 --> 39:54.314
My Damascus knife and

39:54.434 --> 39:57.145
my Cuban cigars!

39:59.314 --> 40:00.695
Qkay...

40:00.815 --> 40:04.866
I was deeply moved by your pledge
to save the villagers just now,

40:04.986 --> 40:08.740
so I'll only charge you
HK$20,000 for that.

40:09.032 --> 40:12.994
For your understanding, I
express my deepest gratitude.

40:13.202 --> 40:16.377
We'll start investigation first
thing in the morning, okay?

40:16.497 --> 40:17.253
Okay.

40:17.373 --> 40:21.085
International Commerce
Centre, noon.

40:29.969 --> 40:32.722
Eat slowly. Take you time.

40:36.184 --> 40:38.184
What did you see that night?

40:41.522 --> 40:47.153
I saw that guy pee, long range.

40:47.904 --> 40:51.522
Not just ordinarily long
range, but very freaking long.

40:52.533 --> 40:57.538
He flew high. Not just ordinarily
high, but very freaking high.

41:11.761 --> 41:14.514
From this moment on,
you've seen nothing.

41:16.057 --> 41:18.893
If that guy shows up,
give him a call.

41:19.727 --> 41:21.727
Qkay...

41:22.563 --> 41:25.779
Don't be wasteful. Finish
all food before you go.

41:43.084 --> 41:48.923
The Divine Monk said, General He was
destined to have major mishaps.

41:49.549 --> 41:51.592
What kind of mishaps?

41:52.260 --> 41:56.681
You'd live and die,
and live again.

41:58.391 --> 42:02.061
In 7 days, the five
stars will align.

42:03.479 --> 42:07.567
Your life will see
major changes.

42:08.943 --> 42:11.154
That means it'll
happen very soon.

42:11.529 --> 42:15.658
No. It takes a long long time.

42:16.409 --> 42:20.163
Here are the 7 Datura seeds
that were passed down...

42:20.580 --> 42:24.125
with the Golden Wheel of Time.

42:24.292 --> 42:27.628
The Divine Monk decides
to let you have them.

42:29.005 --> 42:32.216
They are brought to you by fate.

42:33.718 --> 42:38.306
Someone will move Mount Xumi...

42:38.639 --> 42:40.767
with his small but strong will.

42:40.975 --> 42:43.816
When that person successfully
grows Datura flowers,

42:43.936 --> 42:46.606
miracles will happen to you.

42:47.523 --> 42:50.531
A cause is the effect.
An effect is the cause.

42:50.651 --> 42:53.654
You sow the seeds,
You reap the fruit.

42:54.322 --> 42:59.577
Whether it's cause or effect,
it all depends on your Karma.

43:06.793 --> 43:12.048
Seeds from 5,400 years
ago, do they still sprout?

43:21.057 --> 43:22.146
Come on...

43:22.266 --> 43:25.520
May. How come you didn't
show up for so long?

43:25.686 --> 43:27.485
Mum, you recognise me?

43:27.605 --> 43:31.906
You think I'm crazy or something? How
can I not recognise my daughter?

43:32.026 --> 43:35.696
Uncle Seven, your Jade
pendant is so pretty.

43:36.531 --> 43:40.868
When I die, will you let
it be buried with me?

43:41.119 --> 43:45.712
Well, you'll live long and I'm afraid
that won't happen any time soon.

43:45.832 --> 43:48.423
The Divine Monk told me I
must experience 7 mishaps.

43:48.543 --> 43:52.547
I've experienced...
life and death.

43:53.548 --> 43:55.596
There must be a reason
for me to be here.

43:55.716 --> 43:57.932
I need to know what
fruit I'd reap.

43:58.052 --> 43:59.392
I believe the seeds...

43:59.512 --> 44:02.056
will sprout very soon.

44:02.390 --> 44:03.438
How do you know?

44:03.558 --> 44:07.895
You told me, miracles happen...
as long as you insist.

44:28.207 --> 44:31.919
Sai Yeung Choi St.
Mongkok, night.

44:56.277 --> 44:59.225
Delicious! This curry
chicken is really good.

44:59.405 --> 44:59.994
Chicken?

45:00.114 --> 45:01.704
Chicken.

45:01.824 --> 45:02.413
Curry what?

45:02.533 --> 45:03.873
Curry fish ball.

45:03.993 --> 45:06.871
Curry fish ball.

45:07.455 --> 45:08.336
Curry... Curry fish ball.

45:08.456 --> 45:09.295
Whatever.

45:09.415 --> 45:11.415
Curry... Curry fish ball.

45:12.084 --> 45:14.008
Are we anywhere near
the brothel yet?

45:14.128 --> 45:15.176
You seem so horny.

45:15.296 --> 45:19.013
You won't understand how it feel not
having make love for 400 years.

45:19.133 --> 45:21.015
Let's warm up by talking
with the girls first.

45:21.135 --> 45:23.059
You can do whatever you
want in the room later.

45:23.179 --> 45:26.307
The girls here... do they
play music and dance?

45:26.474 --> 45:29.060
Not music. But they
know how to blow.

45:29.227 --> 45:32.313
I bring your favorites...
Tina and Vincy.

45:32.480 --> 45:33.528
Hi.

45:33.648 --> 45:35.863
Excuse Me, do you have
girls with paler,

45:35.983 --> 45:38.486
smoother skin?

45:38.653 --> 45:40.868
Of course I do. I'll
go look for you.

45:40.988 --> 45:43.407
You come here. And
look for more.

45:47.536 --> 45:49.536
Come sit over here.

45:49.997 --> 45:53.167
Bosses, they are pale and
smooth enough, right?

45:53.334 --> 45:55.216
Xixi and Wenwen,

45:55.336 --> 45:56.717
say hi to the bosses.

45:56.837 --> 45:58.803
Hi bosses!

45:58.923 --> 46:03.552
They are pale and
smooth, but I want...

46:04.178 --> 46:09.850
their waist to be... less
wide, ...more skinny.

46:10.017 --> 46:12.017
Sure, I'll go and look.

46:12.270 --> 46:13.734
Hey come over. This one is hot.

46:13.854 --> 46:15.854
Xixi, go.

46:16.274 --> 46:18.030
How are you, boss?

46:18.150 --> 46:20.150
I'm Xixi.

46:30.288 --> 46:32.086
Bosses, I bring you

46:32.206 --> 46:34.046
the most wanted girls in store.

46:34.166 --> 46:36.585
This is Ada, and this is Ching.

46:37.837 --> 46:38.509
Not bad.

46:38.629 --> 46:39.969
Hello.

46:40.089 --> 46:41.179
Hello.

46:41.299 --> 46:46.721
(JAPANESE) Good Evening, I'm
Ching, Nice to Meet You.

46:47.013 --> 46:51.100
Japanese frail! It's time to pay
back what you owe our nation!

46:51.309 --> 46:53.232
I hate Japanese!

46:53.352 --> 46:54.275
Sao! Stop it!

46:54.395 --> 46:55.276
You Japanese frail!

46:55.396 --> 46:57.396
Calm down, Sao.

46:57.523 --> 46:59.817
You crazy! I'm Chinese!

46:59.984 --> 47:02.128
I'm not doing business with you!

47:05.448 --> 47:07.592
<i>By the way, what about Sora Am'?</i>

47:09.118 --> 47:11.118
She belongs to the world.

47:17.960 --> 47:18.966
Are you ready? Okay.

47:19.086 --> 47:21.547
Five. Five. Ten. Twenty.

47:21.714 --> 47:23.471
Let me play with you.

47:23.591 --> 47:26.405
Alright, you gotta have
some more to drink.

47:26.552 --> 47:28.552
Yeah.

47:30.890 --> 47:32.563
You're wasted.

47:32.683 --> 47:34.683
Let me.

48:32.952 --> 48:35.996
Hong Kong Police
Headquater, afternoon.

48:36.163 --> 48:39.166
We're trying this new
face recognition system

48:39.458 --> 48:41.215
developed by NASA.

48:41.335 --> 48:43.335
CIA is also using it.

48:43.504 --> 48:44.885
It's very expensive and

48:45.005 --> 48:47.096
we haven't got the budget approved
by Finance Committee yet.

48:47.216 --> 48:51.137
The system divides a
person's face, features,

48:51.429 --> 48:54.444
proportion into 147 sets
of data for analysis.

48:54.723 --> 48:56.731
It's connected with the
Cisco super computer.

48:56.851 --> 48:58.441
We can track and monitor
all close-circuit cameras

48:58.561 --> 49:00.109
owned by the government,

49:00.229 --> 49:02.570
and the cameras on the
walkie-talkie of all constables.

49:02.690 --> 49:06.324
A match of 80% or above means it's
very likely to be the same person.

49:06.444 --> 49:10.531
The system will instantly find
out the location of the target.

49:13.617 --> 49:14.874
Good morning, sir!

49:14.994 --> 49:16.994
Sir!

49:18.205 --> 49:20.205
Find these three guys for me.

49:24.295 --> 49:27.980
Sir, the system is for those
on Police wanted list only.

49:28.549 --> 49:30.765
How did you know
they're not wanted?

49:30.885 --> 49:32.767
Can't they be wanted even
if they're not on the list?

49:32.887 --> 49:35.701
You have to know all
internal intelligence?

49:36.015 --> 49:38.293
Should I report to
you from now on?

49:41.061 --> 49:44.523
These guys killed our
officers in Sheung Wan.

49:45.149 --> 49:47.829
It's a major loss of
face for the police.

49:48.027 --> 49:50.112
We have to play it down. Okay?

49:50.571 --> 49:52.703
Understood. Input
the info at once.

49:52.823 --> 49:54.823
Yes, Sir.

49:55.743 --> 49:59.497
I don't want to stay here.
I'm just waiting to die.

49:59.914 --> 50:01.999
I'm not sick anymore.

50:02.708 --> 50:03.964
I remember you.

50:04.084 --> 50:07.338
You're Uncle Seven. You're May.

50:08.631 --> 50:11.717
Mum, be a good girl.

50:11.967 --> 50:14.308
You haven't fully recovered.
Stay here, okay?

50:14.428 --> 50:17.309
I'm fine. You don't have
to take care of me.

50:17.431 --> 50:21.602
There's someone dying here every day.
It's a haunted place.

50:21.769 --> 50:24.485
It's a haunted place. I close my
eyes and I can't fall asleep.

50:24.605 --> 50:26.070
Oh.

50:26.190 --> 50:28.190
What now?

50:28.776 --> 50:30.366
What now?

50:30.486 --> 50:32.159
Let's see how you behave.

50:32.279 --> 50:36.492
If you stay here
being a good girl,

50:36.784 --> 50:39.041
so that May doesn't have to
worry, I'll give it to you

50:39.161 --> 50:40.251
when you get better.

50:40.371 --> 50:42.795
Uncle Seven, you can't lie
to an old woman like me!

50:42.915 --> 50:47.002
I'll keep my promise. I'm a royal
bodyguard from Ming Dynasty.

50:47.253 --> 50:50.256
Mum, Uncle Seven won't lie.

50:50.422 --> 50:51.011
Really?

50:51.131 --> 50:52.012
Of course.

50:52.132 --> 50:54.468
Okay, let's go back to my room.

50:55.594 --> 50:57.977
Uncle Seven, when I have
my vacation next week,

50:58.097 --> 51:00.146
I want you to make
lamb dumplings.

51:00.266 --> 51:01.355
What ever you like.

51:01.475 --> 51:03.644
So happy. I want lamb dumplings.

51:03.811 --> 51:05.811
Be good!

51:11.944 --> 51:15.614
Tolo Harbour Highway, night.

51:49.273 --> 51:51.405
Mister, your home
address please.

51:51.525 --> 51:53.736
Don't bother me. Get lost.

51:53.902 --> 51:55.902
Station, it's 5007, over.

52:08.959 --> 52:09.423
What is it?

52:09.543 --> 52:10.591
Sir, target seen on
Castle Peak Road,

52:10.711 --> 52:12.921
near Lingnan and
Fu Tei sections.

52:14.465 --> 52:18.218
Tung Chung golf course, morning.

52:28.562 --> 52:29.193
Professor Wong.

52:29.313 --> 52:31.313
Commissioner Cheung.

52:32.566 --> 52:35.783
I kept reading the Sindhu epic
Ramayana you mentioned last time.

52:35.903 --> 52:37.903
But I didn't have a clue.

52:38.280 --> 52:39.954
It's simple.

52:40.074 --> 52:43.243
Shiva is one of key
Hindu deities.

52:43.410 --> 52:45.663
His penis is called Linga,

52:45.996 --> 52:49.875
which represents creativity
and power of life.

52:50.250 --> 52:54.797
According to the epic,

52:55.047 --> 52:57.555
Shiva copulates with
Madhura for 100 years.

52:57.675 --> 53:00.761
The deities saw his
vigor and virility,

53:00.969 --> 53:02.309
suggesting that...

53:02.429 --> 53:05.432
he squirt his sperms in Ganges,

53:05.683 --> 53:09.603
so that land around the
river would be fertile.

53:10.187 --> 53:13.107
As Linga symbolizes holy power,

53:13.315 --> 53:15.859
I'm sure Golden Wheel of Time...

53:16.193 --> 53:21.281
has to be activated with Linga.

53:22.574 --> 53:24.574
Thanks, Professor.

54:07.995 --> 54:09.995
Who is it?

54:10.539 --> 54:12.539
Huh?

54:16.754 --> 54:19.032
Take action as soon
as SDU arrives.

54:34.271 --> 54:36.315
Hey. It's Pang.

54:36.523 --> 54:39.568
Eh... I heard the horse
called Terminator,

54:50.037 --> 54:51.669
the horse owner said go ahead.

54:51.789 --> 54:54.124
Hey. In cash, okay?

54:56.752 --> 54:58.752
We must win this time.

55:01.715 --> 55:03.715
Yes.

55:05.260 --> 55:07.538
Is that your toilet?
Let me use it.

55:22.402 --> 55:24.201
I nailed him.

55:24.321 --> 55:25.285
He's locked inside!

55:25.405 --> 55:26.578
Action. Go.

55:26.698 --> 55:28.698
Give me cash. Cash!

55:39.962 --> 55:40.634
Hang in there.

55:40.754 --> 55:42.754
Fire at will.

55:49.263 --> 55:51.263
Cash!

56:32.931 --> 56:34.931
Holy cow!

56:51.450 --> 56:52.831
Holy cow!

56:52.951 --> 56:55.078
My place is covered in faeces!

57:10.802 --> 57:12.802
Over there!

57:13.597 --> 57:15.597
Damn it!

57:35.285 --> 57:37.362
Hong Kong Transport Department.

57:38.664 --> 57:40.958
License Plate Enquiry

57:41.124 --> 57:44.461
input number:

57:44.628 --> 57:46.964
Searching...

58:45.272 --> 58:47.899
What are you doing?

58:52.446 --> 58:55.120
Didn't you say the Jade
pendant was from the Emperor?

58:55.240 --> 58:59.796
I promised your mother I'll give it to her.
I'm just keeping my word.

59:00.620 --> 59:02.620
Thank you.

59:07.252 --> 59:09.343
When we first came to Hong Kong,

59:09.463 --> 59:12.632
we had a really hard time.

59:13.800 --> 59:16.970
As soon as I spoke Mandarin,

59:17.637 --> 59:19.681
everyone would stare at me.

59:22.225 --> 59:27.147
Discrimination really hurts.

59:29.066 --> 59:32.349
Back in my days, if you use
a different dialect...

59:32.611 --> 59:35.160
in the Capital, everything
is marked up by 20%.

59:35.280 --> 59:38.992
We are weird xenophobic beings.

59:40.035 --> 59:43.519
When we come across people
who are different from us,

59:43.997 --> 59:46.007
we join forces and bully them.

59:46.875 --> 59:48.875
It's human nature.

59:53.173 --> 59:58.053
Years later, I pretended to be
overseas Chinese living in Hong Kong.

59:58.970 --> 01:00:01.561
Now that I think about it,
it's just ridiculous.

01:00:01.681 --> 01:00:04.267
I lied...

01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:07.395
just to make more money...

01:00:09.022 --> 01:00:11.022
for my mom's treatment.

01:00:15.237 --> 01:00:18.073
I just wanted her to
live a good life.

01:00:22.285 --> 01:00:24.663
Don't blame yourself.

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:27.290
It's destiny.

01:00:30.377 --> 01:00:37.384
Your mother is a
happy-go-lucky kid.

01:00:40.178 --> 01:00:42.722
I'm sure up there in heaven,

01:00:42.889 --> 01:00:45.435
she still wants you
to live on happily.

01:00:46.518 --> 01:00:48.518
Right?

01:00:51.356 --> 01:00:52.779
This is Uncle Seven.

01:00:52.899 --> 01:00:56.278
Do you want May to
live on happily?

01:00:56.862 --> 01:01:00.323
Don't just laugh.
Tell her yourself.

01:01:04.911 --> 01:01:08.748
Mum, I promise,

01:01:09.207 --> 01:01:10.756
I'll live on happily.

01:01:10.876 --> 01:01:13.879
Louder! You morn doesn't
hear that well.

01:01:15.005 --> 01:01:18.800
Mum! Can you hear me?

01:01:19.926 --> 01:01:21.475
I'll live on happily!

01:01:21.595 --> 01:01:22.726
Don't worry.

01:01:22.846 --> 01:01:25.140
Your daughter will
live on happily.

01:01:27.684 --> 01:01:31.104
Legislative Council, morning.

01:01:31.396 --> 01:01:33.612
Since the implementation
of minimum wage,

01:01:33.732 --> 01:01:37.283
countless number of shops and
restaurants closed down.

01:01:37.652 --> 01:01:39.988
How tough it is to stay afloat?

01:01:40.155 --> 01:01:42.496
Owners are thinking so hard
that our hair turns gray.

01:01:42.616 --> 01:01:46.286
Without us, where can
workers find a job?

01:01:46.912 --> 01:01:50.165
In a progressive
society, those capable

01:01:50.332 --> 01:01:51.838
are not supposed to
subsidize those incapable.

01:01:51.958 --> 01:01:52.380
Speak.

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:54.800
Sir, target location,
Legislative Council.

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:58.011
Those not capable enough to
live here, go back to mainland.

01:01:58.131 --> 01:02:00.131
Or rotten to death!

01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:13.693
Help!

01:02:13.813 --> 01:02:19.903
Help! Someone's after me!

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:22.070
Mr. Tang, get in the car.

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:47.102
Mr. Tang, please wait here.

01:02:47.222 --> 01:02:49.567
Commissioner Cheung
is rushing back.

01:02:51.017 --> 01:02:53.937
How can you serve me
drinks from canteen?

01:02:54.104 --> 01:02:57.789
Go get a latte from Starbucks for me.
I want it low-fat.

01:02:58.692 --> 01:02:59.406
Wan Chai Police Headquarter.

01:02:59.526 --> 01:03:00.574
Attention please, all officers.

01:03:00.694 --> 01:03:02.367
Please pay attention
to a Chinese man...

01:03:02.487 --> 01:03:05.073
wearing red shirt
and black blazer.

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:06.997
He's of medium build with
shoulder-length hair.

01:03:07.117 --> 01:03:09.536
He was last seen
at LegCo Building.

01:03:09.703 --> 01:03:11.703
This man is very danger.

01:03:11.830 --> 01:03:13.336
Attention please, all officers.

01:03:13.456 --> 01:03:15.130
Please pay attention
to a Chinese man...

01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:17.877
wearing red shirt
and black blazer.

01:03:18.086 --> 01:03:19.926
He's of medium build with
shoulder-length hair.

01:03:20.046 --> 01:03:22.324
He was last seen
at LegCo Building.

01:03:54.622 --> 01:03:56.622
Oh, sorry.

01:04:07.635 --> 01:04:09.635
Thank you.

01:04:17.312 --> 01:04:19.312
High Ranking Officer Lounge.

01:04:41.753 --> 01:04:43.218
Officer Szeto, what
are you doing?

01:04:43.338 --> 01:04:44.052
What did you eat?

01:04:44.172 --> 01:04:46.172
Hey, it's not me.

01:04:51.388 --> 01:04:54.599
Hey! Where's my latte? My latte?

01:05:07.278 --> 01:05:10.281
Hush! Be quiet!

01:05:11.116 --> 01:05:13.039
Does it hurt?

01:05:13.159 --> 01:05:15.159
Well, it should.

01:05:36.141 --> 01:05:37.731
Why did you send
me to Hong Kong?

01:05:37.851 --> 01:05:38.982
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:05:39.102 --> 01:05:40.358
Then why did you run
when you saw me?

01:05:40.478 --> 01:05:43.069
You look hideous and violent.
It's only natural to run.

01:05:43.189 --> 01:05:44.571
Are you bluffing me?

01:05:44.691 --> 01:05:46.691
So? Ouch!

01:05:47.277 --> 01:05:48.616
Give me a minute.

01:05:48.736 --> 01:05:52.287
I'll ask deities to possess me.
I'm not afraid of you.

01:05:53.158 --> 01:05:57.245
I beg Taishang Laojun,
urgently and righteously.

01:05:59.706 --> 01:06:02.834
Guandi please show
your true self.

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:08.047
Oath of the Peach Garden; Loyalty
and justice last forever.

01:06:08.256 --> 01:06:10.300
My face and my heart are red;

01:06:10.467 --> 01:06:13.951
My beard is long and my
righteousness is even longer.

01:06:14.721 --> 01:06:18.104
I'll use my Sinew-splitting and
Bone-dislocating trick on you.

01:06:18.224 --> 01:06:20.815
Your meridians will mess
up, muscles twitching,

01:06:20.935 --> 01:06:22.150
sinews grinding against bones.

01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:24.986
No one can ever stand this gruesome
torture without telling the truth.

01:06:25.106 --> 01:06:27.106
Guandi, here I come.

01:06:31.571 --> 01:06:36.326
Executing Yan Liang; Killing
Wen Chou; Passing 5 gates...

01:06:45.335 --> 01:06:48.343
This freaking hurts... Ouch...
This freaking hurts!

01:06:48.463 --> 01:06:50.470
Forgive me for using too much force.
Excuse me, Guandi.

01:06:50.590 --> 01:06:52.514
Guandi is gone.

01:06:52.634 --> 01:06:55.261
So, who sent me here?

01:06:56.346 --> 01:06:59.265
Someone told me to.

01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:01.815
Who?

01:07:01.935 --> 01:07:06.064
I can't tell. I'll
get killed if I do.

01:07:12.111 --> 01:07:17.116
He's Cheung Yat-ming, Deputy
Commissioner of Police.

01:07:17.283 --> 01:07:20.286
He's a partner of my
smuggling business.

01:07:23.957 --> 01:07:25.880
Sir, I'll use Gazetteer
to lock on the target.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Good.

01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:33.138
Speak.

01:07:33.258 --> 01:07:34.472
Commissioner Cheung,
we located the target.

01:07:34.592 --> 01:07:35.432
Where?

01:07:35.552 --> 01:07:38.031
In the VIP lounge,
Police headquarter.

01:07:38.221 --> 01:07:40.221
Back to the headquarter.

01:07:44.978 --> 01:07:48.690
Help! Help!

01:07:57.991 --> 01:08:01.786
Thrust harder. Have
you guys not eaten?

01:08:04.831 --> 01:08:07.208
Listen. Block all exits.

01:08:07.375 --> 01:08:08.256
Don't let a single
soul in or out.

01:08:08.376 --> 01:08:10.376
Yes, Sir.

01:08:17.343 --> 01:08:20.054
Idiots! You want
to crush my head?

01:08:23.765 --> 01:08:25.765
Are you okay?

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:35.533
Why did Cheung
Yat-ming unearth me?

01:08:35.653 --> 01:08:37.327
I don't know.

01:08:37.447 --> 01:08:40.705
I was only responsible for
transporting the three of you here.

01:08:40.825 --> 01:08:42.165
There are two more?

01:08:42.285 --> 01:08:44.871
They look just like you.

01:08:45.037 --> 01:08:46.377
Where are they now?

01:08:46.497 --> 01:08:48.497
Where's Golden Wheel of Time?

01:08:49.792 --> 01:08:53.504
Do you mean the Sindhu Saucer?

01:08:58.091 --> 01:09:00.772
The rear exit of East
Wing is sealed off.

01:09:02.596 --> 01:09:05.104
Commissioner Cheung, he's holding Mr.
Tang hostage.

01:09:05.224 --> 01:09:06.272
We dare not break in.

01:09:06.392 --> 01:09:08.107
Idiot! Were you born yesterday?

01:09:08.227 --> 01:09:10.304
Idiot! Were you born yesterday?

01:10:23.761 --> 01:10:25.226
What did he ask you?

01:10:25.346 --> 01:10:29.475
I said nothing. Nothing at all.

01:10:30.977 --> 01:10:34.522
Nothing? Aren't you
scared of pain?

01:10:37.108 --> 01:10:40.737
Ian Kwai Fong, late night.

01:10:58.546 --> 01:10:59.677
Have you seen him?

01:10:59.797 --> 01:11:02.550
No... Get lost!

01:11:04.218 --> 01:11:06.971
Hi everyone. Anyone
knows this hero?

01:11:07.138 --> 01:11:09.145
I owe him money and
want to repay him.

01:11:09.265 --> 01:11:12.023
Cash reward of HK$10,000
for anyone who finds him.

01:11:12.143 --> 01:11:14.067
I can't sleep well
when I'm in debt.

01:11:14.187 --> 01:11:15.318
What?

01:11:15.438 --> 01:11:18.691
Cash? I don't believe it.
Pass it over.

01:11:18.858 --> 01:11:21.235
Hey, he looks like
your boyfriend.

01:11:21.986 --> 01:11:24.280
Nonsense!

01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:27.009
Don't crack jokes on
things like that.

01:11:29.327 --> 01:11:32.538
Look closely, is
he your boyfriend?

01:11:32.705 --> 01:11:34.420
Oh yes, this is definitely
your boyfriend.

01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:35.046
It's really him.

01:11:35.166 --> 01:11:36.923
No way.

01:11:37.043 --> 01:11:40.213
You're drunk! You're drunk!

01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:43.216
That's him, why
don't you admit it?

01:11:46.677 --> 01:11:47.934
Don't make a scene.

01:11:48.054 --> 01:11:49.769
Drink.

01:11:49.889 --> 01:11:52.183
Me first. Ten. Ten.
Five. Fifteen.

01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:55.520
Ten. Twenty. Twenty. Ten. Ten.

01:11:55.686 --> 01:11:57.730
You are... He Ying!

01:12:08.407 --> 01:12:09.956
Who's phone?

01:12:10.076 --> 01:12:12.328
Hey midget. Stop
messing with us.

01:12:12.578 --> 01:12:14.578
Give it back.

01:12:25.007 --> 01:12:27.007
Is this yours?

01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:31.144
What the hell? You
think I'd budge

01:12:31.264 --> 01:12:32.562
because of your scary face?

01:12:32.682 --> 01:12:34.682
Come here if you dare!

01:13:10.761 --> 01:13:13.055
He Ying, you show up at last.

01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:29.820
Get lost.

01:14:55.241 --> 01:14:57.743
Wake up! Wake up!

01:14:58.786 --> 01:15:01.414
Wake up! Wake up!

01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:35.698
Wake up! They're closing on us!

01:16:24.038 --> 01:16:27.917
Ten Thousand Buddhas
Monastery, dawn.

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:01.038
A mantra? Why didn't you
mention it earlier?

01:17:01.158 --> 01:17:03.158
I almost killed him!

01:17:03.994 --> 01:17:05.835
It's a new discovery.

01:17:05.955 --> 01:17:09.834
Queen Mary Hospital, dawn.

01:17:14.547 --> 01:17:16.929
Miss, what's your relationship
with the patient?

01:17:17.049 --> 01:17:19.390
I don't know him. I
saw him pass out

01:17:19.510 --> 01:17:21.654
on the street and took him here.

01:17:21.846 --> 01:17:22.727
Please follow up on this case.

01:17:22.847 --> 01:17:23.185
Okay.

01:17:23.305 --> 01:17:25.021
Please come over. I need to write
down your personal particulars.

01:17:25.141 --> 01:17:27.141
Sure.

01:17:37.695 --> 01:17:39.864
Sir, target found. 100% match.

01:17:46.704 --> 01:17:48.127
What's happening to these two?

01:17:48.247 --> 01:17:50.546
Fever this moment.
Hypothermia the next.

01:17:50.666 --> 01:17:53.002
The blood test is even stranger.

01:17:53.169 --> 01:17:55.551
They don't have
antibodies for epidemics

01:17:55.671 --> 01:17:57.136
occurring in the past
few hundred years,

01:17:57.256 --> 01:17:58.679
just like space aliens.

01:17:58.799 --> 01:17:59.680
Nurse?

01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:02.850
Give them shots of the strongest
antibiotics Vancomycin.

01:18:02.970 --> 01:18:05.478
If they have abnormal response,
give them this tranquilizer too.

01:18:05.598 --> 01:18:06.312
Okay.

01:18:06.432 --> 01:18:07.188
Hey fat woman.

01:18:07.308 --> 01:18:09.815
Prescribing Vancomycin? You
don't think it's too strong?

01:18:09.935 --> 01:18:13.319
I'm afraid it's some strange
contagious disease like SARS.

01:18:13.439 --> 01:18:15.488
My house will be worth much
less if property prices dive.

01:18:15.608 --> 01:18:19.778
Cheung Yiu-Fai, please report
to distribution station.

01:18:20.571 --> 01:18:22.328
What're you doing?

01:18:22.448 --> 01:18:23.829
Have you saved my brother yet?

01:18:23.949 --> 01:18:26.035
Who's your brother?

01:18:26.744 --> 01:18:29.121
The one I sent here just now.

01:18:29.955 --> 01:18:34.126
If you can't save him today,
I can't save you either!

01:18:34.501 --> 01:18:36.501
Keep your hands off me!

01:18:36.879 --> 01:18:39.345
We have to save every
one of our patients.

01:18:39.465 --> 01:18:40.387
We have a fair
medical system here,

01:18:40.507 --> 01:18:41.972
we treat every patient
without discrimination.

01:18:42.092 --> 01:18:45.184
Each and every life is
equally precious. Got it?

01:18:45.304 --> 01:18:45.851
Doc, calm down.

01:18:45.971 --> 01:18:47.971
None of your business!

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:51.600
Doctor,

01:18:52.144 --> 01:18:54.438
then when will my
brother wake up?

01:18:54.688 --> 01:18:56.688
An hour later.

01:18:56.857 --> 01:18:59.610
This one's for you.
With beef patties.

01:19:00.444 --> 01:19:02.655
Food is not allowed here.

01:19:03.072 --> 01:19:05.621
You either get out of here
and stuff your face...

01:19:05.741 --> 01:19:08.369
or sit here quietly and wait.

01:19:08.535 --> 01:19:11.330
Don't yell and scream. Okay?

01:19:11.622 --> 01:19:13.337
Thank you. You're welcome.

01:19:13.457 --> 01:19:14.547
You're welcome.

01:19:14.667 --> 01:19:16.382
Okay.

01:19:16.502 --> 01:19:17.633
What're you looking at?
Keep walking!

01:19:17.753 --> 01:19:20.232
Nothing to see here.
Get back to work.

01:19:33.352 --> 01:19:35.352
What's the matter, officer?

01:19:36.981 --> 01:19:40.859
Wong Fung-Yee, please
go to Room no. 2...

01:19:55.874 --> 01:19:56.839
Hold on a sec...

01:19:56.959 --> 01:19:57.298
Junior.

01:19:57.418 --> 01:19:57.840
Yes?

01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:00.217
The two patients just woke up.
Give them a shot of tranquilizer.

01:20:00.337 --> 01:20:01.677
Okay.

01:20:01.797 --> 01:20:05.013
There's so much work to
do here on the 4th floor.

01:20:05.884 --> 01:20:08.679
Wake up! Wake up now!

01:20:08.846 --> 01:20:11.015
Wake up!

01:20:15.728 --> 01:20:19.648
Water! Give me water!

01:20:20.482 --> 01:20:22.482
Quick!

01:20:28.073 --> 01:20:30.576
You... you're that...

01:20:50.262 --> 01:20:51.727
Sir, these are the two injured.

01:20:51.847 --> 01:20:53.437
This is an extremely dangerous criminal.
I need to take him with me.

01:20:53.557 --> 01:20:54.647
Yes, sir.

01:20:54.767 --> 01:20:56.398
How about this one?

01:20:56.518 --> 01:20:58.518
Just an illegal immigrant.

01:21:02.399 --> 01:21:03.239
You escort him to
detention centre.

01:21:03.359 --> 01:21:05.324
Yes, sir.

01:21:05.444 --> 01:21:07.368
Wake up! Wake up!

01:21:07.488 --> 01:21:09.954
Those assassins hunting after
you are right outside.

01:21:10.074 --> 01:21:12.074
Wake up!

01:21:27.466 --> 01:21:30.349
I'll take the personal belongings of
those two illegal immigrants with me.

01:21:30.469 --> 01:21:34.221
The girl with He Ying is here.
He is definitely here too.

01:21:35.808 --> 01:21:37.106
Oh, he woke up already?

01:21:37.226 --> 01:21:39.226
Where's the other one?

01:21:40.771 --> 01:21:42.528
Tell me. How to give him an
instant boost of energy?

01:21:42.648 --> 01:21:43.988
Sleep early. Wake up early.
Eat regularly.

01:21:44.108 --> 01:21:45.864
Sunbathing. Drink more water.

01:21:45.984 --> 01:21:48.153
This is your main artery, right?

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:50.320
That's adrenaline.

01:21:56.495 --> 01:21:58.495
What is it?

01:21:59.081 --> 01:22:01.225
It's called Linga in Sanskrit...

01:22:01.542 --> 01:22:03.919
believed to be Shiva's penis.

01:22:04.086 --> 01:22:04.842
Enormous penis?

01:22:04.962 --> 01:22:09.133
To activate Golden Wheel,
you need to insert Linga...

01:22:09.341 --> 01:22:11.385
and recite the secret mantra.

01:22:12.010 --> 01:22:16.014
Golden Wheel is offered
to Ming Emperor only,

01:22:16.181 --> 01:22:22.479
you can't disclose this
secret to anyone else.

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:41.707
Please rest assured.

01:22:42.124 --> 01:22:46.010
I swear on my life that I won't
let anyone know the mantra.

01:22:51.758 --> 01:22:54.178
Damn you!

01:22:59.725 --> 01:23:00.773
Where's Linga?

01:23:00.893 --> 01:23:02.893
Linga? The police took it.

01:23:05.522 --> 01:23:07.522
Let's go.

01:23:16.074 --> 01:23:18.074
Sir, all done.

01:23:30.005 --> 01:23:32.005
Niehu, there they are!

01:23:44.436 --> 01:23:46.813
It's show time.

01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:48.980
KEY

01:23:52.319 --> 01:23:54.319
Follow them!

01:24:06.124 --> 01:24:07.131
Get on! Quick.

01:24:07.251 --> 01:24:08.841
Commissioner Cheung, target
has left the hospital,

01:24:08.961 --> 01:24:10.971
running toward Tsuen Wan West.

01:24:29.648 --> 01:24:30.487
Bring me Linga.

01:24:30.607 --> 01:24:32.607
Yes, Boss.

01:24:40.367 --> 01:24:43.500
Commissioner Cheung, target
reaches the Tsing Ma Bridge.

01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:45.169
Would you like to
seal off the area?

01:24:45.289 --> 01:24:48.166
No. Wait for me, I'm on my way.

01:25:17.362 --> 01:25:21.158
Tsing Ma Bridge

01:25:39.551 --> 01:25:41.266
Sao, it takes you forever.

01:25:41.386 --> 01:25:43.143
Do you know what you're doing?

01:25:43.263 --> 01:25:46.725
Niehu, stop nagging.
It's really distrubing.

01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:35.021
Are you nuts?

01:26:43.615 --> 01:26:44.746
Hey, Wake up!

01:26:44.866 --> 01:26:45.497
What the heck?

01:26:45.617 --> 01:26:47.617
Shut up or I'll beat you up!

01:27:35.667 --> 01:27:37.667
Oh my baby!

01:27:42.299 --> 01:27:44.342
He Ying!

01:28:19.377 --> 01:28:21.377
Give me a hand.

01:28:39.731 --> 01:28:40.320
Look.

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:41.113
There's a horse.

01:28:41.233 --> 01:28:43.233
Hey... Look.

01:28:52.744 --> 01:28:53.208
Don't be afraid.

01:28:53.328 --> 01:28:55.328
Let us out!

01:28:58.834 --> 01:29:00.834
Give me a hand.

01:29:31.908 --> 01:29:33.908
Look at him.

01:30:10.947 --> 01:30:13.121
Don't worry, things
will be alright.

01:30:13.241 --> 01:30:15.241
Help!

01:31:49.921 --> 01:31:52.924
He Ying, your arm is crippled.

01:31:53.174 --> 01:31:55.174
How are you gonna fight?

01:31:58.847 --> 01:32:00.847
Sao!

01:32:42.182 --> 01:32:44.476
Come on, let's go! Quick!

01:34:30.915 --> 01:34:32.915
Niehu!

01:35:19.756 --> 01:35:21.756
Be careful!

01:35:33.186 --> 01:35:35.563
He Ying!

01:35:38.066 --> 01:35:40.526
He Ying! He Ying!

01:36:19.649 --> 01:36:23.403
Stanley Prison,
three days later.

01:36:53.016 --> 01:36:55.016
Yuanlong!

01:36:55.184 --> 01:36:57.184
He's alive.

01:37:00.273 --> 01:37:03.114
I got secret intelligence and
seized a bunch of letters

01:37:03.234 --> 01:37:05.366
written to the Japanese pirates.

01:37:05.486 --> 01:37:07.630
There must be a spy in the army,

01:37:07.905 --> 01:37:11.389
selling out our intelligence
to the Japanese pirates.

01:37:18.624 --> 01:37:22.778
Indian border, Winter, 1621 A.D.
(1ST YEAR OF THE TIANQI REIGN)

01:37:25.631 --> 01:37:27.631
Yuanlong.

01:37:34.098 --> 01:37:36.098
Why did you kill Yanyin?

01:37:37.060 --> 01:37:39.060
Why did you kill Yanyin?

01:37:43.274 --> 01:37:45.274
Niehu!

01:37:45.568 --> 01:37:47.568
Sao!

01:37:48.905 --> 01:37:53.126
You conspired with Japanese pirates.
What will become of us all?

01:37:55.787 --> 01:37:59.957
I've been upright and honest all my life.
How would I do that?

01:38:00.291 --> 01:38:02.710
Intelligence found
out the murderer

01:38:02.919 --> 01:38:04.300
used your unique weapon.

01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:07.423
He Ying, not only did
you betray our country,

01:38:07.632 --> 01:38:09.632
but also our brotherhood.

01:38:09.801 --> 01:38:13.513
We've been the closest
friends all our life.

01:38:13.679 --> 01:38:16.627
I can't believe you're
such a stranger to us.

01:38:18.142 --> 01:38:18.731
Yuanlong.

01:38:18.851 --> 01:38:20.191
Here.

01:38:20.311 --> 01:38:20.900
He Ying.

01:38:21.020 --> 01:38:21.943
Here.

01:38:22.063 --> 01:38:24.063
Niehu.

01:38:24.857 --> 01:38:26.857
Sao.

01:38:28.152 --> 01:38:31.368
Yunnan Dali, 1616 A.D.
(44TH YEAR OF WANLI REIGN)

01:38:31.739 --> 01:38:37.078
Build inner power in lower abdomen.
Squirt!

01:38:41.082 --> 01:38:43.209
Who doesn't know we're

01:38:43.376 --> 01:38:46.129
the longest range
pissers in the Capital?

01:38:46.796 --> 01:38:47.677
That's right!

01:38:47.797 --> 01:38:49.512
Damn right!

01:38:49.632 --> 01:38:52.343
And the strongest,
bravest fighters too!

01:38:59.642 --> 01:39:01.642
Done? Let's go.

01:39:02.228 --> 01:39:03.609
Brothers, let's go!

01:39:03.729 --> 01:39:04.736
Go!

01:39:04.856 --> 01:39:06.856
Go!

01:39:59.076 --> 01:40:02.288
Three months later.

01:40:19.013 --> 01:40:22.725
If this saucer really
is a time machine,

01:40:23.184 --> 01:40:24.232
you and I will go first.

01:40:24.352 --> 01:40:27.271
But will it change the history?

01:40:27.897 --> 01:40:32.788
If we go back to Ming Dynasty, would
it still be the Ming Dynasty we know?
