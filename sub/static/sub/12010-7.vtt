WEBVTT

00:02.360 --> 00:04.874
<i>- Are we nearly there yet?</i>
<i>- Stop asking me that.</i>

00:04.960 --> 00:07.428
- I need a wee.
- I told you to go before we left.

00:07.520 --> 00:09.909
I didn't need it then.
Pull over. I'm busting.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.673
All right, but be quick.
I don't know if we can park here.

00:12.760 --> 00:15.877
You can't. That's a loading bay.
So, that's a five denarii fine.

00:15.960 --> 00:17.109
Oh, come on, mate!

00:17.200 --> 00:19.589
You can't stop here,
unless you're loading or unloading.

00:19.680 --> 00:20.749
We just unloaded him!

00:20.840 --> 00:23.195
- And now he's unloading himself.
- Soz, I were busting.

00:23.280 --> 00:25.919
- Oi, short arse, stop that.
- Sorry, Officer.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.070
- I did tell him to go before we left.
- Is he yours then?

00:28.160 --> 00:30.116
- Sort of, but...
- So make him stop.

00:30.920 --> 00:33.195
- Can you stop that, Grumio?
- Not really, I'm mid flow.

00:33.280 --> 00:34.349
He's mid flow!

00:34.440 --> 00:36.635
Well, public urination is a ten denarii fine.

00:36.720 --> 00:39.188
Oh, eff off! Jobsworth dickhead!

00:39.280 --> 00:41.840
- As is insulting a warden.
- Right, terrific!

00:41.920 --> 00:44.275
So that's five for the parking,

00:44.360 --> 00:48.319
and 10 each for the piss and the dickhead.

00:48.400 --> 00:49.992
Have a super day now!

00:50.560 --> 00:51.595
Yeah, you too, mate.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.594
Oh, I needed that. Off we go, then.

00:58.964 --> 01:08.973
<b><font color="#004F8C">Ripped By mstoll
Happy New Year 2015 - New Year, New Color ;-)</font></b>

01:10.240 --> 01:13.152
Chuffing Nora,
is that the law courts?

01:13.240 --> 01:14.468
Looks more like a palace.

01:14.640 --> 01:16.312
How come they've got so much dough, then?

01:16.400 --> 01:18.960
How do you think, Grumio?
They keep fining goons like us.

01:19.040 --> 01:21.679
Hey, is that Fabianus?

01:22.080 --> 01:24.150
What? Ignore him, he hasn't seen us.

01:24.240 --> 01:25.753
Hey! Fabianus!

01:25.840 --> 01:27.671
It's me, Stylax, from school.

01:27.760 --> 01:28.909
He's seen us now.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.470
Hey, Stylax, wow! How weird!

01:32.560 --> 01:34.312
I had no idea you were even in Rome.

01:34.880 --> 01:37.155
And Marcus, and the little slave.

01:37.320 --> 01:39.117
Hey, Fabianus, great to see you.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.474
I'm called Fab now.

01:40.640 --> 01:42.392
You here to pay a fine as well, Fab?

01:42.600 --> 01:45.160
Not quite, no, I... I work here.

01:45.640 --> 01:48.029
- You're a lawyer?
- Yeah, for my sins.

01:48.320 --> 01:50.595
- Junior counsel.
- That's amazing!

01:50.680 --> 01:52.636
It's amazing they let a thicko like me do it.

01:52.720 --> 01:55.439
It's just shouting in public really,
but for money.

01:55.880 --> 01:57.836
What about you guys? What are you up to?

01:58.080 --> 01:59.593
- Still a slave.
- Uh-huh.

01:59.680 --> 02:02.069
- And Marcus?
- I'm a writer.

02:02.160 --> 02:04.116
Oh, cool. What kind of writing?

02:04.280 --> 02:07.078
Uh, a real range, you know,
it's whatever happens to come to me.

02:07.160 --> 02:09.276
- He's a copier.
- Oh, a copier!

02:09.560 --> 02:11.391
- Good for you, buddy.
- It's a stop gap.

02:11.480 --> 02:12.959
- I'm a charioteer.
- Fab.

02:13.040 --> 02:14.234
- He's not really.
- Training to be.

02:14.360 --> 02:15.634
Yeah, that's how I got my ticket.

02:15.720 --> 02:17.915
The training's more about speed than parking.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.399
Uh-huh. Let me see, then.

02:19.920 --> 02:22.275
OK, parking in a loading bay,

02:22.360 --> 02:24.828
public urination,
insulting an officer, wow.

02:25.320 --> 02:27.038
- You guys are naughty!
- Yeah.

02:27.120 --> 02:28.189
We're happy just to pay them.

02:28.280 --> 02:29.395
Yeah, you don't need to.

02:29.480 --> 02:31.755
The warden who issued these
failed to put a serial number,

02:31.840 --> 02:33.114
so, they are not valid.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.629
Give them to Lydia in Appeals,
she'll let you off.

02:35.720 --> 02:36.755
Thanks a lot, Fab!

02:36.840 --> 02:39.798
- Hey, glad we ran into you.
- Yeah, me too.

02:39.880 --> 02:41.677
In fact, what are you guys doing tonight?

02:41.760 --> 02:43.432
I'm having a little soiree at my place.

02:43.520 --> 02:46.796
Nothing major, just some chicks
and chaps and chips and some dips.

02:46.880 --> 02:48.916
What do you say? Lt'll be like old times.

02:51.480 --> 02:54.517
No way! We are not going.
Fabianus is a total goon.

02:54.600 --> 02:57.478
But it's still a party, and he's called Fab now.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.273
The last time I went to one of his parties

02:59.360 --> 03:01.635
he wouldn't come out from under his bed
'cause he pooed himself

03:01.720 --> 03:03.711
and everyone was calling him Flabby Anus.
It was rubbish.

03:03.800 --> 03:06.519
That was when we were 10
and it wasn't everyone, that was all you.

03:06.600 --> 03:09.273
- Bullshit! We all did it.
- Nah, that was just you.

03:09.360 --> 03:12.557
You drew the big bum picture in his locker
and made up the big bum song.

03:13.280 --> 03:15.157
<i>♪ Flabby Anus! Flabby Anus!</i>

03:15.240 --> 03:16.753
<i>♪ You've got a flabby, flabby, flabby anus! ♪</i>

03:16.840 --> 03:18.034
I stand by it, mate.

03:23.600 --> 03:25.511
- You live here, do you, lads?
- Why? What's going on?

03:25.600 --> 03:27.795
- I'm looking for your landlord.
- What do you want him for?

03:27.960 --> 03:29.916
- He's been housing illegal immigrants...
- Shit!

03:30.000 --> 03:33.037
...and dealing drugs,
trafficking weapons, trafficking people,

03:33.240 --> 03:36.232
engaging in extortion,
bribery, vote rigging and murder.

03:36.600 --> 03:38.989
Oh, he's in trouble then, is he?

03:39.080 --> 03:40.229
I'd say so, yes.

03:40.360 --> 03:43.716
- Mr Centurion!
- Yo! Got those papers then, love?

03:44.000 --> 03:48.755
Sorry, my scatty slaves still can't find them,
but I promise you we're not illegal.

03:48.840 --> 03:52.515
So if there was any way
you could just let us off, please?

03:52.800 --> 03:54.358
Nah, sorry, I can't do that.

03:54.440 --> 03:56.351
- Pretty please?
- What does that mean?

03:56.440 --> 03:59.477
Just the same as please, except I'm pretty.

04:00.280 --> 04:01.349
Still no.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.477
Right. Bear with me.

04:04.240 --> 04:06.470
Do you think the landlord's
done a runner or what?

04:06.560 --> 04:08.312
Hope so. Rent's due tomorrow.

04:10.000 --> 04:16.074

04:19.160 --> 04:20.798
It's too big for me, frankly,

04:21.079 --> 04:23.640
but it's close to work, so, yeah, it's handy.

04:24.240 --> 04:26.390
Must be very difficult to heat in winter.

04:26.480 --> 04:28.277
Oh, it is. That's why I put the hypocaust in.

04:28.360 --> 04:30.999
- Under-floor heating all year round.
- Sick!

04:31.240 --> 04:33.435
I think where you live sounds fab, though.

04:33.520 --> 04:36.592
All that hustle and bustle and cattle.

04:37.240 --> 04:38.229
Sorry, one sec.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.880
Hey, babe, so glad you could make it.

04:43.160 --> 04:44.229
See you.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.552
So, let me give you the tour.

04:51.800 --> 04:54.598
- Little balconette.
- Holy shit!

04:54.840 --> 04:58.879
I know. I hardly ever use it, to be honest,
'cause I'm always at the bloody office.

04:59.040 --> 05:01.600
Thanks again for getting us
off those fines by the way.

05:01.680 --> 05:04.114
Any time. I never forget old mates.

05:04.320 --> 05:06.595
So if you ever need help, I'm here.

05:07.920 --> 05:09.478
Likewise, as am I.

05:09.560 --> 05:11.676
Aw, so sweet of you to offer,

05:11.760 --> 05:14.115
but I've already got my own team of copiers.

05:14.440 --> 05:19.195
Up here on the right is my personal
fitness suite slash meditation studio.

05:26.360 --> 05:27.475
Hmm.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.319
Fair play.

05:36.440 --> 05:37.714
Oh.

05:44.600 --> 05:46.431
Oh, fuck!

05:49.680 --> 05:52.911
- This is my own personal Hades.
- Why? He's being really nice.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.719
It's like he's forgotten about
all the bad shit you did to him.

05:55.800 --> 05:57.597
Of course he's forgotten, the smug git.

05:57.800 --> 05:59.791
He lives in a penthouse,
he's having sex with her,

05:59.920 --> 06:03.151
he's not thinking about the big bum
I drew on his locker at school.

06:03.600 --> 06:04.794
Oh, shit the bed!

06:05.080 --> 06:07.036
It's Cordelia, from the year above.

06:07.480 --> 06:10.313
- Isn't that who you lost your virginity to?
- Hmm, sort of.

06:10.400 --> 06:13.392
Sort of? I don't think you can
"sort of" lose your virginity.

06:13.480 --> 06:15.914
You can. It was in the ditch
behind the running track.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.797
We were young and inexperienced.

06:17.880 --> 06:20.348
She was tense and I was limp.

06:20.840 --> 06:23.832
Limp? How? That thing's always on.

06:23.920 --> 06:25.478
When you wake up,
when you're having lunch,

06:25.560 --> 06:27.437
when you get brushed
by a woman or a breeze.

06:27.520 --> 06:29.909
Thanks, man. Yeah.
I just can't believe she's here.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.516
After all these years, I've finally got a chance
to set things straight.

06:34.600 --> 06:36.795
- OK, lovely. See you tomorrow, then.
- Hmm.

06:38.280 --> 06:40.555
Marcus, I've had a bit of an accident.

06:40.680 --> 06:41.829
Oh, what now?

06:42.760 --> 06:44.512
You bloody idiot! Just put it back.

06:44.840 --> 06:46.273
- How?
- Stick it back on or something.

06:46.360 --> 06:47.793
- What with?
- I don't care, Grumio.

06:47.880 --> 06:49.359
It's your dick. You deal with it.

06:54.640 --> 06:55.755
Thank you very much.

07:03.320 --> 07:04.548
Hi, Cordelia.

07:05.840 --> 07:07.831
- Stylax Eurisces!
- Hey.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.638
Well, I'll be damned.
I haven't seen you since...

07:09.720 --> 07:11.597
Yeah, I think we both know when it was,

07:11.680 --> 07:13.671
behind the running track at school.

07:13.760 --> 07:17.070
- Of course. I can picture it now.
- Yeah, don't do that.

07:17.560 --> 07:18.834
Listen, I'm gonna cut to the chase.

07:19.280 --> 07:21.794
- I need another crack.
- Right.

07:21.880 --> 07:24.474
- Subtle as ever, I see.
- I've got some killer moves now.

07:24.800 --> 07:26.791
Well, I don't know, Stylax.

07:26.920 --> 07:28.751
I mean, you really think you've got it in you?

07:28.840 --> 07:30.398
Whoa! I've got it in me,

07:30.480 --> 07:32.516
and this time you'll have it in you.

07:33.040 --> 07:34.109
OK, that's romantic.

07:34.200 --> 07:36.839
Sorry, what I meant is
we owe it to our younger selves

07:36.960 --> 07:40.475
and our younger goolies to fulfil our destiny.

07:41.360 --> 07:42.475
We'll be amazing together.

07:47.280 --> 07:49.157
Come on, you bastard!

07:54.400 --> 07:56.630
- All right?
- Yeah, fine.

07:57.840 --> 07:59.671
Why are you holding my statue's phallus?

08:01.480 --> 08:02.469
Why not?

08:05.800 --> 08:06.915
Hmm.

08:12.400 --> 08:13.833
So where were we?

08:13.920 --> 08:16.115
- Somewhere round here.
- Oh, yeah.

08:16.200 --> 08:17.349
But in a ditch.

08:21.640 --> 08:23.232
OK, I'm ready.

08:24.360 --> 08:26.954
- Sorry, you're...
- I'm ready. Do it. Put it in.

08:27.360 --> 08:29.271
Um, just a sec.

08:29.840 --> 08:30.909
Aren't you ready?

08:31.000 --> 08:34.833
Um, yeah, I'm ready. Bear with me.

08:35.559 --> 08:38.279
- Come on, put it in me, Stylax.
- Yeah, I...

08:38.360 --> 08:41.238
Come on, is it in yet?
Put it in me, Stylax, come on!

08:46.000 --> 08:47.831
Now, look, I'm really sorry.

08:48.240 --> 08:50.151
This has, like, never happened before,

08:51.040 --> 08:52.837
like, apart from that one time.

08:54.920 --> 08:56.592
It happened again. You're kidding!

08:56.680 --> 08:59.399
Yeah. At one point,
I tried to salvage some dignity

08:59.480 --> 09:01.436
and sort of fold it in.

09:01.520 --> 09:04.557
- Fold it in? Like an egg?
- Mmm. More like a rope.

09:04.640 --> 09:06.392
Oh! What was she doing?

09:06.480 --> 09:07.515
Well, this is it.

09:07.600 --> 09:10.717
She just lay there like a log saying, "Put it in,"

09:10.800 --> 09:13.837
exactly like she did in the ditch,
which is standard when you're 15.

09:13.920 --> 09:16.718
- But now? She's not learnt a thing.
- Neither have you, mate.

09:16.800 --> 09:20.076
I've learnt loads, thank you.
I just can't work in those conditions.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.628
- She's got to wriggle around.
- Did you tell her that?

09:22.720 --> 09:24.597
I was in no position to criticise, mate.

09:24.680 --> 09:26.636
My penis was like a cold little acorn.

09:26.720 --> 09:28.870
As far as she's concerned, it's my problem.

09:28.960 --> 09:30.632
- Oh, that's not fair.
- Yeah.

09:30.800 --> 09:32.279
- That would have happened to anyone.
- Mmm.

09:32.480 --> 09:33.549
Not me, mate!

09:34.120 --> 09:35.951
Well, maybe wait until you've had sex and...

09:36.040 --> 09:38.474
Oh, yeah, ha-ha-ha! You're really funny.

09:38.560 --> 09:41.518
I've actually had sex eight times, so eff off.

09:41.600 --> 09:42.589
- Eight?
- Eight.

09:42.680 --> 09:44.557
- Is that all?
- Eight's loads and you know it.

09:44.640 --> 09:45.629
- It really isn't
- It is.

09:45.720 --> 09:47.358
And for all eight, I was as hard as a nail.

09:47.480 --> 09:49.118
- And as big as a nail?
- No, bigger.

09:49.200 --> 09:50.918
- Your dick's the size of a big nail?
- No.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.355
- Is it as thin?
- My dick is as big as a tent peg.

09:54.680 --> 09:56.159
That's good to know, Water Boy.

09:56.360 --> 09:58.590
Remind me to take you with me
when I next go camping.

09:58.720 --> 10:00.119
Yes, will do. It's Water Man.

10:00.240 --> 10:03.994
Now stop all the squawking in here.
I have got a horrid hangover.

10:04.400 --> 10:07.039
Yeah, sorry, it's just, um,
Stylax couldn't get an erection.

10:08.200 --> 10:10.430
- Why was he trying to do that?
- Not in here.

10:10.520 --> 10:13.080
- In bed, with a lady.
- Oh, I see.

10:13.400 --> 10:15.197
A word in my office, Shredder.

10:19.800 --> 10:22.075
My husband routinely suffered from the droop

10:22.280 --> 10:24.350
and when it was at its peak, so to speak,

10:24.440 --> 10:27.079
he'd insist on using a splint
to prop the thing up.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.673
- Oh, that's clever.
- It's not.

10:28.960 --> 10:32.191
Splints mean splinters,
and that is frankly unacceptable,

10:32.280 --> 10:34.840
even for someone of my admittedly
off-centre proclivities.

10:34.920 --> 10:36.239
Oh, ouch!

10:36.320 --> 10:39.551
Your best bet is Carthaginian glory root.

10:39.640 --> 10:42.552
You'll need to ask
drug dealers or possibly gardeners.

10:42.680 --> 10:46.150
The street name is
gentlemen's friend or hell mouth.

10:46.240 --> 10:47.275
Hell mouth?

10:47.360 --> 10:50.033
Yes, it makes the mouth smell
very much like hell.

10:50.120 --> 10:53.556
So, once taken, you can't kiss
or speak or indeed open it,

10:53.640 --> 10:56.074
so you will need
to get straight down to business.

10:56.160 --> 10:57.513
Yeah, shouldn't be a problem.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.195
Ah!

11:21.920 --> 11:23.319
Oh, <i>salve</i>, Grumio.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.636
All right, Landlord?
What are you doing in there?

11:25.720 --> 11:29.030
Uh, just a bit of fun.
A bit of, um, hide and seek.

11:29.360 --> 11:31.430
Oh. Who's doing the seeking, then?

11:31.520 --> 11:32.953
Well, the rozzers, I expect.

11:33.120 --> 11:35.509
- So what you got there, then?
- It's a stone penis.

11:35.920 --> 11:37.831
I need to hide it from the guy
what it belongs to.

11:37.920 --> 11:40.195
What, so there's a stone guy
looking for his dick, is there?

11:40.280 --> 11:42.430
No, the real guy who owns the stone guy.

11:42.520 --> 11:44.317
Oh, right. Oh, well, hide it in here with me.

11:44.400 --> 11:46.038
Ah, wicked. Cheers.

11:46.240 --> 11:47.389
What's that on the end of it?

11:47.680 --> 11:51.036
- It's pâté.
- Oh, lovely, mmm.

11:51.600 --> 11:54.353
Any chance of any more? I'm starving in here.

11:54.440 --> 11:57.000
- Oh.
- And, um... Hush, hush, OK?

11:59.520 --> 12:02.034
- Hell mouth?
- Yeah, or gentlemen's friend,

12:02.120 --> 12:03.348
for when I next see Cordelia.

12:03.440 --> 12:05.715
Why would you wanna see her again?
Just forget her.

12:05.800 --> 12:08.155
Are you mad? I have to stick it to her

12:08.240 --> 12:10.231
before she starts trash talking my penis.

12:10.320 --> 12:13.392
- Who would she talk to?
- Well, I don't know, anyone. Fab?

12:13.480 --> 12:16.597
So forget that smug shit as well.
Let's never see either of them ever again.

12:16.840 --> 12:20.276
- Marcus, you have to help us.
- Hey, what's up?

12:20.360 --> 12:22.794
- Figured out what happened to those papers?
- Yes, I think so.

12:22.960 --> 12:26.157
Remember the cold snap, when it was
so freezing that I couldn't get out of bed?

12:26.280 --> 12:27.508
Or you wouldn't get out of bed.

12:27.840 --> 12:29.990
Anyway, we ran out of kindling for the fire,

12:30.080 --> 12:31.752
and whilst Mets went out to find some,

12:31.840 --> 12:33.831
I sort of improvised and, well...

12:34.320 --> 12:36.276
- We don't have any papers.
- Right.

12:36.360 --> 12:37.839
But we do have a court summons.

12:38.120 --> 12:39.951
You don't know anyone
who could help us, do you?

12:46.200 --> 12:47.918
So you'll take the case, then?

12:48.040 --> 12:49.758
Marcus, it would be a pleasure.

12:52.360 --> 12:53.395
Thank you.

12:53.480 --> 12:54.799
That is so incredibly kind.

12:54.880 --> 12:56.598
- I don't know what to say.
- Say nothing.

12:56.840 --> 12:58.751
A friend of Marcus is a friend of mine.

12:58.880 --> 13:00.757
He was always such a good mate at school.

13:01.520 --> 13:02.953
Yeah. We should probably...

13:04.680 --> 13:06.591
Before you go, actually, bud,

13:06.680 --> 13:09.672
I don't suppose you know what happened
to my satyr statue the other night.

13:09.760 --> 13:11.637
Mmm, no. Why?

13:11.720 --> 13:14.712
- The phallus has been snapped off.
- Oh.

13:15.120 --> 13:16.189
Maybe his wife caught him cheating.

13:16.280 --> 13:17.713
Yeah, it's not that!

13:17.800 --> 13:19.916
Someone stole it, and it's an antique.

13:20.240 --> 13:21.719
But I'm sure it'll turn up.

13:22.400 --> 13:25.870
Oh, and, Marcus, she's a peach.
Top work, buddy.

13:25.960 --> 13:28.838
Oh, thanks... Fab.

13:32.360 --> 13:34.669
I thought the pâté would go well
with a slice of bread.

13:34.760 --> 13:35.795
Good thinking.

13:35.880 --> 13:38.633
And then I thought I'd get some ham
to make it into a sandwich.

13:38.720 --> 13:39.755
Didn't really ask for that, but...

13:39.840 --> 13:42.559
Then I figured we'd need
some wine to wash it down with.

13:43.040 --> 13:46.715
And then a cake for after,
and a cheese course for after that,

13:47.080 --> 13:48.274
and then a chicken

13:49.080 --> 13:50.195
and then another chicken.

13:51.160 --> 13:52.878
- Shall I be mother?
- Go on, then.

13:55.120 --> 13:57.839
He's forgotten about everything,
the big bum stuff, the drawing.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.114
- Are you sure?
- Hundred percent.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.349
He just wants to be my friend.

14:00.440 --> 14:03.671
And does he know about me and Cordelia
and the whole floppy dick thing?

14:03.960 --> 14:06.599
- It didn't come up, so to speak.
- Ha!

14:07.560 --> 14:09.198
I need to get hold of that root, man.

14:09.720 --> 14:10.948
Knock-a-doodle-doo.

14:11.120 --> 14:13.793
- Fab! What are you doing here?
- This is your office?

14:14.120 --> 14:16.714
It's so cute. It's like where the toys might live.

14:17.480 --> 14:18.959
- Was there a reason you came or...
- Yes.

14:19.160 --> 14:21.674
Fab news. We've got a date
for Cynthia's hearing.

14:21.760 --> 14:23.751
I know the judge.
He sits next to me at the arena.

14:23.840 --> 14:24.909
Ah, brilliant!

14:25.000 --> 14:26.991
Keen eye for the ladies,
so tell her to get dolled up,

14:27.080 --> 14:28.149
show a bit of leg,

14:28.240 --> 14:30.674
and let's just say he'll have no objections.

14:31.400 --> 14:32.958
- OK, bud?
- Yes, bud.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.275
- Nice beard.
- Thank you. I know.

14:37.600 --> 14:39.113
Hmm, cool guy.

14:53.240 --> 14:56.073
- I don't need that.
- Hey, come on! As if!

14:56.920 --> 14:59.309
I can't find any glory root.

14:59.400 --> 15:03.393
I've advertised my impotence all over the city,
and can't find a single drug dealer.

15:07.360 --> 15:08.759
Did our wardrobe just fart?

15:11.600 --> 15:14.068
Phew! Been holding that in for ages.

15:14.600 --> 15:17.239
Grumio, why is the landlord in our wardrobe?

15:17.320 --> 15:18.389
I didn't put him there.

15:18.520 --> 15:20.829
And what about the stone dick,
did you put that there?

15:20.920 --> 15:21.955
Yeah, that were me.

15:22.040 --> 15:24.793
We've got a known criminal,
literally, squatting in our wardrobe.

15:24.920 --> 15:26.831
You boys owe me rent for last week.

15:27.320 --> 15:28.833
Give me rent for the wardrobe, then.

15:29.080 --> 15:31.640
- How about we call it quits?
- How about I call a centurion?

15:31.720 --> 15:34.837
Or how about you let me stay,
and I help you look for the glory root?

15:34.920 --> 15:37.514
- Oh, yeah? Really?
- Why look around for a dealer

15:37.600 --> 15:39.352
when there's one right under your nose?

15:40.560 --> 15:42.357
Oh, sorry, big lunch.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.035
Phew!

15:54.880 --> 15:56.632
- Where is he?
- He'll be here.

15:57.080 --> 15:58.991
Is this enough make-up, do you think, Mets?

15:59.520 --> 16:01.351
Yeah, that'll probably do.

16:02.520 --> 16:04.795
Here he is. See? It's all fine.

16:05.080 --> 16:06.115
Fab!

16:06.840 --> 16:08.876
Fab, we're this side.

16:09.480 --> 16:11.277
- Why's he sitting over there?
- I don't know.

16:11.640 --> 16:13.551
I'll just... Fab?

16:22.680 --> 16:23.795
Right.

16:27.640 --> 16:29.631
- What is it?
- It's nothing.

16:29.720 --> 16:31.358
It's just sort of legal, you know, jargon.

16:31.680 --> 16:33.636
- It looks like a big bum.
- Mmm. Yeah, it does a bit.

16:33.720 --> 16:35.676
Why has he given us a bum picture?

16:35.760 --> 16:37.273
Basically, funny story.

16:37.720 --> 16:41.952
Uh... At school I drew something
very like this on his locker, so...

16:42.040 --> 16:44.031
- Why?
- Well, because his name is Fabianus.

16:44.120 --> 16:47.749
So I used to... Everyone used
to call him Flabby Anus,

16:47.920 --> 16:49.672
and there was a lot of anus-themed...

16:50.200 --> 16:53.636
- Bullying?
- It was banter, sort of one-way banter.

16:54.040 --> 16:55.359
I thought he'd forgotten.

16:55.480 --> 17:01.237
In the case of the Roman Empire
versus Cynthia Cogidubna,

17:01.720 --> 17:04.358
a Briton charged with illegal immigration.

17:04.440 --> 17:05.792
Who is prosecuting?

17:06.480 --> 17:08.516
Fab Meridius Attica.

17:13.440 --> 17:15.351
And who's defending?

17:24.520 --> 17:25.635
Oh, great!

17:25.760 --> 17:27.318
Marcus Valerius Gallo.

17:28.760 --> 17:29.875
Hello.

17:36.440 --> 17:40.069
If I can take you back to the night
in question, mid November you say,

17:40.160 --> 17:42.469
- can you please describe it to me?
- Of course.

17:42.560 --> 17:44.391
It was extremely cold.

17:44.520 --> 17:47.114
Breathing was painful,
I'm sure you all remember.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.998
I don't personally,
because I've got under-floor heating,

17:50.080 --> 17:54.358
but I have obtained a weather report
from the city's meteorologists.

17:54.800 --> 17:55.789
Let me read it to you.

17:57.400 --> 17:59.550
"The week of the 12th of November,

17:59.640 --> 18:03.428
"rain, scattered showers,
wind north-easterly,

18:03.520 --> 18:08.469
"temperature 17 degrees,
unseasonably clement."

18:08.560 --> 18:10.198
He's good, isn't he?

18:10.280 --> 18:14.751
It must be very warm in Britain,
if you find such weather cold.

18:15.160 --> 18:17.515
Is it indeed warm in Britain?

18:21.080 --> 18:23.992
- Even I knew that.
- Shut your gob, will you? It's ponging.

18:24.080 --> 18:25.479
Oh, good. Means it's working.

18:25.800 --> 18:28.109
Better be over soon.
I'm gonna peak too early at this rate.

18:28.680 --> 18:31.478
She claims that she's an actress.

18:31.560 --> 18:33.039
I am an actress!

18:33.120 --> 18:36.590
Yet, I have no records
of a single performance to date.

18:36.720 --> 18:38.153
I'm bad at auditions.

18:38.240 --> 18:39.673
And so you turned
to what, exactly?

18:40.040 --> 18:41.712
Dancing? Stripping?

18:41.800 --> 18:44.394
No! I mean, I can dance, but...

18:44.480 --> 18:48.996
Look closely, ladies and gentlemen,
and you will get your answer.

18:49.080 --> 18:51.275
She may say that she is pure,

18:51.440 --> 18:55.991
but her painted face and skimpy garb
tell a different story,

18:56.080 --> 18:58.753
as the trappings of her real trade,

18:58.840 --> 19:01.991
a lady of the night, a whore.

19:02.080 --> 19:04.196
I am not a whore!

19:06.480 --> 19:08.198
No further questions, my lord.

19:10.760 --> 19:12.398
Order! Order!

19:13.600 --> 19:14.715
Mr Gallo.

19:18.040 --> 19:19.155
Yeah.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.235
Uh...

19:27.480 --> 19:29.948
Firstly, she's not a prostitute, Your Honour.

19:30.040 --> 19:33.112
Cynthia Cogidubna is nice,
although she can be,

19:33.200 --> 19:35.111
as this incident proves, a bit of a ditz.

19:35.200 --> 19:37.395
- Piss off. I'm not a ditz.
- Yeah, don't heckle probably.

19:37.640 --> 19:39.949
- Well, don't call me a ditz.
- I'm sorry, you're not.

19:40.200 --> 19:42.077
Cynthia is a credit to Rome.

19:42.520 --> 19:47.196
She's fun and friendly
and beautiful, inside and out.

19:47.280 --> 19:50.238
I can't take the testimony
of her lawyer, Mr Gallo.

19:50.320 --> 19:54.916
Character testimony can only be
provided by an impartial Roman citizen.

19:55.160 --> 19:56.559
OK, so...

19:57.360 --> 19:58.554
Stylax.

19:58.720 --> 20:00.790
I call Stylax Eurisces, please.

20:00.880 --> 20:03.474
- Is this man here?
- Yo! Here.

20:03.560 --> 20:05.994
And, uh, are you prepared
to take to the stand?

20:07.120 --> 20:09.634
- Would I need to stand?
- Yes.

20:10.360 --> 20:11.509
No, then. Sorry.

20:11.600 --> 20:14.478
You two are a joke.

20:15.440 --> 20:17.192
Oh, go fuck yourself, dickface.

20:17.280 --> 20:19.271
Right, yeah, really clever, Gallo.

20:19.360 --> 20:22.397
This man has no legal training, Your Honour.

20:22.480 --> 20:24.596
He is a mere copier,

20:24.680 --> 20:26.910
who was recently fined for urinating in public.

20:27.240 --> 20:28.639
That wasn't me. That was my slave.

20:28.720 --> 20:32.759
The same slave who stole the phallus
from my antique statue, I presume?

20:32.840 --> 20:36.116
Yeah, well, this man pooed himself
when he was 10, Your Honour.

20:36.200 --> 20:38.430
That is neither true nor pertinent,
Your Honour.

20:38.520 --> 20:42.115
Oh, it's true, all right. This man did
a big pertinent poo in his pants,

20:42.320 --> 20:43.878
right out of his flabby anus,

20:43.960 --> 20:45.598
even though he's calling himself Fab now

20:45.720 --> 20:47.836
and he shags fit girls in his massive flat,

20:47.920 --> 20:50.878
the knob, he's still just Fabianus
with the flabby anus,

20:50.960 --> 20:53.599
and things just slip out of his bum
'cause it's so baggy and flabby.

20:53.880 --> 20:55.393
- Are you finished?
- No.

20:55.520 --> 20:57.397
<i>♪ Flabby Anus! Flabby Anus!</i>

20:57.480 --> 20:59.596
<i>♪ You've got a flabby, flabby, flabby anus</i>

20:59.680 --> 21:01.750
<i>♪ Your bum hole smells heinous</i>

21:01.840 --> 21:04.115
<i>♪ You've got a flabby, flabby, flabby anus ♪</i>

21:11.520 --> 21:13.192
No further questions, Your Honour.

21:16.120 --> 21:18.998
And what sentence are you proposing
for the Briton and her slave?

21:19.080 --> 21:20.274
Deportation, Your Honour.

21:20.360 --> 21:22.476
Done. They're to leave Rome in 10 days' time.

21:24.640 --> 21:27.154
Guards, search his premises
for the missing phallus.

21:27.240 --> 21:28.673
Case dismissed.

21:30.520 --> 21:31.669
Did that just happen?

21:32.960 --> 21:34.996
Oh, no, no, come back!

21:35.240 --> 21:36.992
Don't leave me now! Come back!

21:37.920 --> 21:38.989
Shit!

21:40.000 --> 21:42.275
OK, Stylax, I'm ready. Put it in.

21:42.360 --> 21:44.430
- Working on it.
- I want it in me, Stylax.

21:44.520 --> 21:46.272
Just put it... Oh!

21:47.320 --> 21:49.550
- Oh, Stylax!
- Yeah, mmm?

21:49.640 --> 21:51.756
- You're so hard.
- Yeah, I know I am.

21:51.840 --> 21:53.910
And cold.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.752
- Wait, what is that?
- No, not...

21:55.840 --> 21:57.319
It's not really...

21:57.920 --> 22:00.718
Is that... Is that a stone penis?

22:02.040 --> 22:04.315
- Stop doing it?
- I reckon, yeah.

22:04.640 --> 22:06.392
I was desperate. I didn't know...

22:06.480 --> 22:09.756
You tried to penetrate me
with an inanimate object.

22:10.200 --> 22:12.270
You are the inanimate object, mate.

22:12.360 --> 22:15.113
You just lie there, just like you did
in the ditch at school.

22:15.200 --> 22:17.555
- Just get the hell out!
- Yeah, obviously.

22:19.400 --> 22:22.039
This has honestly never happened before.

22:27.800 --> 22:30.951
No sign of the phallus, I'm afraid,
but we did find this.

22:32.080 --> 22:34.230
- <i>Salve</i>, boys.
- All right, Landlord?

22:34.320 --> 22:36.675
- Thanks for having me.
- Thanks for coming.

22:36.760 --> 22:39.797
- Keep walking, shit bird.
- I'll catch you later, then. Be lucky!

22:42.120 --> 22:52.207
