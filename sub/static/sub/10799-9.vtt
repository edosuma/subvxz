00:30.200 --> 00:33.037
Someone sure stripped this place.

00:43.636 --> 00:45.430
The reactor's gone.

00:47.308 --> 00:50.646
No wonder they didn't answer
our hail for two days.

00:50.813 --> 00:52.566
Nothing here to answer with.

00:52.733 --> 00:55.904
I am detecting life signs
from behind that door.

00:56.071 --> 00:57.323
Worf!

00:59.868 --> 01:03.290
Commander? Take a look at this.

01:07.045 --> 01:08.756
Blood.

01:09.632 --> 01:13.888
Yes, but not human. I'm gonna
have to do some analysis on it.

01:19.261 --> 01:20.982
It's jammed.

02:04.712 --> 02:08.008
Space, the final frontier.

02:09.344 --> 02:13.224
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

02:13.391 --> 02:17.814
Its continuing mission,
to explore strange new worlds...

02:18.972 --> 02:22.561
...to seek out new life
and new civilisations...

02:23.740 --> 02:27.871
...to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

03:39.474 --> 03:43.021
The two scientists
are suffering from phaser stuns.

03:43.188 --> 03:45.441
I'd guess several hits each.

03:45.608 --> 03:46.651
Several?

03:46.818 --> 03:50.449
It'll take a while to revive them,
but they will recover.

03:50.616 --> 03:52.910
We found a sample of blood.

03:53.912 --> 03:56.916
It's a rare iron-copper composite,

03:57.083 --> 04:01.423
unique to one humanoid species,
the Acamarians.

04:03.509 --> 04:05.262
Acamarians?

04:06.597 --> 04:09.935
Then that would suggest
the Gatherers.

04:10.311 --> 04:12.188
It is a likely hypothesis.

04:12.355 --> 04:16.528
These nomadic marauders
have raided other outposts

04:16.695 --> 04:18.447
in neighboring sectors.

04:18.613 --> 04:21.702
They've never come out
this far before.

04:21.869 --> 04:24.957
Mr Crusher,
set course for the Acamar system.

04:25.124 --> 04:26.417
Aye, sir.

04:30.048 --> 04:33.261
Captain's log, stardate 43421.9.

04:33.845 --> 04:36.390
To try to put an end
to the Gatherer raids,

04:36.515 --> 04:38.810
we have come to the Acamar system

04:38.977 --> 04:42.900
to enlist the aid of Marouk,
the Sovereign of Acamar III.

04:43.067 --> 04:46.739
Their raids have made
this sector unsafe.

04:46.895 --> 04:51.068
- Trade routes have been disrupted.
- The Gatherers are elusive.

04:51.245 --> 04:55.366
We've only managed to capture
a handful of them.

04:55.543 --> 04:57.546
But with Starfleet's help...

04:57.713 --> 05:01.593
Hunting them down
is not what I am proposing.

05:01.760 --> 05:07.300
Reconciliation with the Gatherers
is impossible. It's been tried.

05:07.477 --> 05:10.815
Every time we offer amnesty,
they reject it.

05:10.940 --> 05:14.278
- When was the last attempt made?
- 18 years ago.

05:14.863 --> 05:16.156
18 years?

05:16.323 --> 05:19.661
For almost a century,
they've been parasites,

05:19.818 --> 05:25.159
moving between star systems,
living on what they found or stole.

05:25.294 --> 05:27.673
- They're still your people.
- No.

05:27.840 --> 05:32.889
Captain, you have to understand
our history.

05:33.056 --> 05:35.100
A hundred years ago,

05:35.267 --> 05:38.522
before the Gatherers split off
from our culture,

05:38.647 --> 05:40.942
we were a savage, violent race.

05:41.067 --> 05:46.867
Clans battled clans. Vengeful feuds
that lasted for generations.

05:47.034 --> 05:52.292
But we overcame those ways,
all except for the Gatherers.

05:52.459 --> 05:56.423
After a century of wandering,
they may be ready to come home.

05:56.590 --> 06:00.888
Despite your progress,
you will remain a divided society

06:01.055 --> 06:03.600
until the Gatherers return to Acamar.

06:05.853 --> 06:07.731
The attempt may be futile.

06:07.898 --> 06:13.823
But there is so much to gain
and so little to lose by the effort.

06:13.990 --> 06:18.413
This problem affects us all.
It cannot be ignored.

06:24.213 --> 06:28.428
- Sovereign, welcome to the bridge.
- Thank you, Captain.

06:28.594 --> 06:30.889
How soon will you be ready to leave?

06:31.056 --> 06:34.478
I'm ready now. I need only bring
two more servants.

06:34.645 --> 06:37.149
I'll see to that
and to accommodations.

06:37.315 --> 06:41.655
I have reason to believe
there is a Gatherer encampment

06:41.822 --> 06:44.493
somewhere in the Hromi Cluster.

06:48.290 --> 06:49.458
Mr Data?

06:49.625 --> 06:54.048
The Federation has charted several
Class-M planets in that area.

06:54.215 --> 06:58.304
Any one of these planets
might serve well as a base.

06:58.471 --> 07:01.934
Mr Crusher,
set course for the Hromi Cluster.

07:02.101 --> 07:03.353
Aye, sir.

07:20.461 --> 07:22.339
A fine ship, Commander.

07:22.506 --> 07:24.634
We're all very proud of her.

07:25.636 --> 07:28.890
Yuta, a light meal in 20 minutes.

07:30.392 --> 07:32.938
May I be shown the kitchen,
Commander?

07:33.105 --> 07:34.190
You're the chef?

07:34.356 --> 07:37.569
Yes. I'll cook for the Sovereign
and her servants.

07:37.736 --> 07:41.408
We can provide a kitchen,
but it won't be necessary.

07:41.575 --> 07:47.250
These food dispensers can synthesise
anything you need. I'll show you.

07:47.417 --> 07:51.798
- Sovereign, a drink?
- Yes, thank you. Cold water.

07:51.965 --> 07:56.222
Computer, a glass of water,
five degrees.

08:03.357 --> 08:04.358
Please.

08:09.449 --> 08:11.452
You're also the food taster?

08:11.619 --> 08:14.289
That's part of the cook's duty.

08:23.887 --> 08:28.435
I'm sure the Sovereign will wish
to sample your ship's cuisines,

08:28.602 --> 08:32.023
but there are Acamarian dishes
she will insist upon.

08:32.190 --> 08:35.361
I'll arrange for your recipes
to be programmed.

08:35.528 --> 08:39.409
Of course, I'll have to try some.
What's your specialty?

08:39.618 --> 08:42.746
- I have none.
- Don't be modest.

08:42.914 --> 08:46.878
You must have come up
with a few culinary delights.

08:48.923 --> 08:52.970
- There is a spiced parthas dish.
- Parthas?

08:53.096 --> 08:55.641
A green vegetable with fleshy roots.

08:56.350 --> 09:00.356
Parthas a la Yuta.
I look forward to tasting it.

09:00.523 --> 09:03.809
Sovereign. Chef.

09:17.214 --> 09:20.010
Entering standard orbit
of Gamma Hromi II.

09:20.177 --> 09:23.974
I am detecting life readings
from the planet surface

09:24.141 --> 09:27.354
as well as areas
of thermal radiation

09:27.521 --> 09:31.276
and carbon dioxide emissions
indicative of combustion.

09:31.443 --> 09:32.695
Campfires, Data.

09:34.239 --> 09:35.824
Is that not what I said?

09:37.034 --> 09:39.454
- It's worth a look.
- Make it so.

09:39.580 --> 09:42.042
Data? Worf?

10:35.911 --> 10:37.872
Artonian lasers.

10:43.714 --> 10:47.762
Tonkian homing beacons.
Quite a collection.

11:02.658 --> 11:06.664
Noranium alloy, sir.
Its salvage value is quite low.

11:06.831 --> 11:10.002
The Gatherers
weren't too discriminating.

11:10.159 --> 11:11.588
Commander?

11:19.600 --> 11:20.893
Ambush!

11:30.657 --> 11:34.454
Rigelian phaser rifles.
Not particularly powerful.

11:37.292 --> 11:39.420
Powerful enough.

11:44.010 --> 11:45.596
We came to talk!

11:53.524 --> 11:57.488
Your words are wasted.
They understand only this.

11:57.655 --> 12:00.325
We're here to establish a dialogue.

12:03.455 --> 12:06.209
Data, noranium vaporises at...?

12:06.376 --> 12:09.338
2,31 4 degrees. Noranium carbide...

12:09.464 --> 12:10.632
Thank you, Data.

12:10.799 --> 12:12.843
Setting seven ought to do it.

12:15.848 --> 12:18.602
Three, two, one. Now!

12:25.654 --> 12:28.157
Enterprise, four to beam up.

12:36.878 --> 12:38.547
Cowards!

12:51.566 --> 12:55.030
Your ambushes would be
more successful if you bathed.

12:58.827 --> 13:03.166
- We've brought the Sovereign.
- Marouk? Here?

13:03.375 --> 13:05.086
With an offer of amnesty.

13:10.844 --> 13:16.310
Full dispensation to all Gatherers
willing to return to Acamar III.

13:16.477 --> 13:18.564
You don't trust me, Marouk.

13:19.523 --> 13:20.942
Should I?

13:21.109 --> 13:25.741
But you expect me to trust you.
Maybe you just poisoned it yourself.

13:27.827 --> 13:29.747
Taste this, Temarek.

13:45.269 --> 13:48.107
Barbarians. This is futile.

13:48.273 --> 13:49.317
Sovereign.

13:50.777 --> 13:52.655
Brull!

13:52.822 --> 13:54.449
Go home, old woman!

13:54.616 --> 13:57.871
You people haven't changed
in 100 years!

13:58.079 --> 14:01.125
You should know. You were there!

14:01.668 --> 14:04.714
Sit down! Please.

14:06.842 --> 14:07.843
Please.

14:16.606 --> 14:20.111
- We're here to talk.
- It's a waste of time, Captain.

14:20.278 --> 14:22.824
They don't care how they live.

14:22.990 --> 14:25.661
Am I to believe you care how we live?

14:25.786 --> 14:27.414
Yes.

14:28.290 --> 14:32.629
- Brull, she's here, isn't she?
- Maybe you forced her to come.

14:35.008 --> 14:38.346
Nobody forces me anywhere, Brull.

14:38.513 --> 14:41.684
What is there for us on Acamar III?

14:43.019 --> 14:45.773
A life. A home.

14:45.982 --> 14:49.696
You can end your wanderings,
your miserable existence.

14:51.532 --> 14:53.952
Do I look miserable to you?

14:57.749 --> 15:01.129
The clan wars are over, Brull.

15:01.296 --> 15:06.262
It is a past we're ashamed of.
It is why you had to leave.

15:07.263 --> 15:11.728
Now... it is time to come home.

15:17.027 --> 15:21.116
I want to speak privately
with Sovereign Marouk and Picard.

15:21.283 --> 15:23.578
Everyone else, get out.

15:37.014 --> 15:40.019
- Any insights?
- Brull's ready to negotiate.

15:40.186 --> 15:42.564
He wants privacy
so he won't appear weak

15:42.731 --> 15:45.151
in front of the other Gatherers.

16:18.908 --> 16:21.537
You are of the clan Lornak.

16:22.497 --> 16:24.250
What of it?

16:26.920 --> 16:30.258
I've seen you before.

16:30.425 --> 16:31.552
Yes.

16:32.219 --> 16:36.142
But... it's impossible.

16:37.310 --> 16:39.563
No. Look closer.

16:41.066 --> 16:44.237
I am Yuta of the clan Tralesta.

16:56.922 --> 17:02.013
I am the last of my line,
but my clan will outlive yours.

17:15.031 --> 17:16.867
Marouk's offer has value.

17:18.369 --> 17:19.788
Commander.

17:19.954 --> 17:23.210
But still, I don't know.

17:24.837 --> 17:27.925
But it is enough
to present to your leader?

17:28.092 --> 17:31.222
Chorgan is a better judge
of these matters.

17:31.389 --> 17:34.643
I will take it to him.
You'll hear from me in 20 days.

17:34.768 --> 17:39.651
Brull, in 20 days,
I hope to be very far from here.

17:39.817 --> 17:42.279
With all due respect, Brull,

17:42.446 --> 17:47.370
I would like to make the offer
to Chorgan myself.

17:47.871 --> 17:49.915
We'll take you on the Enterprise.

17:50.082 --> 17:53.285
How many of your men
do you want to accompany you?

17:53.462 --> 17:55.674
I'll come alone.

17:55.799 --> 17:58.928
- If this is a trap...
- It isn't.

18:02.131 --> 18:04.937
Mallon, you'll be in charge
while I'm gone.

18:05.062 --> 18:09.319
- If I'm not back in 10 days...
- Brull!

18:16.412 --> 18:17.998
Volnath.

18:19.865 --> 18:22.129
Enterprise, medical emergency.

18:22.296 --> 18:25.592
Volnath was old. Nothing can be done.

18:25.801 --> 18:29.254
There's a chance
our doctors can do something.

18:31.976 --> 18:33.729
- You found him?
- Yes.

18:33.896 --> 18:37.651
There are no other Lornak here,
so I claim his possessions.

18:37.776 --> 18:39.112
Granted.

18:42.408 --> 18:44.578
Have you no respect for the dead?

18:44.745 --> 18:48.031
What's there to respect
about a corpse?

18:58.640 --> 19:00.267
No.

19:02.270 --> 19:04.023
Temarek, no.

19:04.148 --> 19:07.778
- He's been dead too long.
- How?

19:07.945 --> 19:09.280
Cardiac arrest.

19:10.824 --> 19:12.619
You don't sound convinced.

19:12.744 --> 19:17.334
No, he died of a heart attack,
but I can't find the cause.

19:17.490 --> 19:22.205
His cardiac muscle is strong.
No sign of arterial occlusion.

19:43.570 --> 19:48.838
Brull, will you show Mr Crusher the
course to set to the Hromi Cluster?

19:49.005 --> 19:50.173
A child?

19:52.009 --> 19:54.763
This doesn't inspire my confidence.

20:13.165 --> 20:15.710
This is our present position.

20:17.171 --> 20:19.831
Set a heading for 343, mark 72.

20:22.053 --> 20:25.839
That'll take us through
the centre of an asteroid belt.

20:26.017 --> 20:27.926
What's the matter, kid?

20:28.103 --> 20:30.857
Can't you fly around
a couple of rocks?

20:32.443 --> 20:33.444
Sure I can.

20:33.528 --> 20:38.952
But if we take this heading,
we can avoid the belt completely

20:39.077 --> 20:42.749
and only lose 12.1 minutes
at warp seven.

20:42.916 --> 20:45.086
Have it your way, kid.

20:51.919 --> 20:55.017
For centuries,
my planet was in chaos.

20:55.768 --> 20:59.357
Loyalty to one's clan was absolute.

21:00.442 --> 21:03.279
The slightest injury to one member

21:03.446 --> 21:05.574
demanded violent retaliation.

21:05.730 --> 21:09.163
And these blood feuds
could last for decades?

21:09.329 --> 21:11.332
The obsession with vengeance

21:11.489 --> 21:14.462
would pass from generation
to generation.

21:14.587 --> 21:19.427
And with each act of retribution,
the violence would escalate.

21:20.971 --> 21:26.020
It's not unlike much of the history
of my own planet.

21:27.981 --> 21:30.819
Your pardon.
May I be excused briefly?

21:30.944 --> 21:34.147
Cmdr Riker requested
I make him an Acamarian dish.

21:34.366 --> 21:36.035
Of course, Yuta.

22:02.855 --> 22:05.619
- What are you doing?
- Homework.

22:05.786 --> 22:07.622
- What is this?
- Math.

22:07.747 --> 22:10.752
I can see that. What does it mean?

22:10.877 --> 22:16.719
It's the Euclidean metrisation of
a K-fold contravariant tensor field.

22:17.386 --> 22:19.056
You any good at it?

22:23.270 --> 22:26.525
- You don't like me.
- I didn't say that.

22:27.151 --> 22:31.323
No problem. I have many friends
that don't like me.

22:31.448 --> 22:34.401
- What do you know about me?
- You're a thief.

22:34.578 --> 22:38.626
I steal to survive,
not because I enjoy it!

22:38.824 --> 22:43.508
We Gatherers value our freedom.
We answer to no creature!

22:43.716 --> 22:46.470
Then why help Marouk change that?

22:49.057 --> 22:51.644
Maybe because I want
something better.

22:51.811 --> 22:54.941
For me... and for my children.

22:56.109 --> 23:00.449
- You have children?
- Yeah. Two sons.

23:01.033 --> 23:02.994
One's just about your age.

23:05.957 --> 23:08.586
He's not any good at math.

23:20.228 --> 23:22.064
Parthas a la Yuta.

23:22.230 --> 23:25.610
With the help
of one of your food stations.

23:31.869 --> 23:35.458
- It's wonderful.
- Truly excellent.

23:35.625 --> 23:38.421
- Thank you.
- Care to join us?

23:38.587 --> 23:40.173
I don't want to intrude.

23:42.093 --> 23:43.595
You're not.

23:45.013 --> 23:49.061
I was just leaving anyway.
Please, sit down.

23:57.615 --> 23:59.493
It really is delicious.

23:59.660 --> 24:01.621
Glad you like it, Commander.

24:01.788 --> 24:03.290
I'm not your commander.

24:03.457 --> 24:05.919
- Call me William.
- If you prefer it.

24:06.086 --> 24:11.218
I do. You say "Commander" like
you say "Sovereign" to Marouk.

24:13.012 --> 24:14.640
As a servant.

24:18.437 --> 24:22.484
You're an excellent commander
but you'd make a poor sovereign.

24:22.651 --> 24:24.821
Why? Not that I disagree.

24:24.988 --> 24:29.161
- You're uncomfortable with servants.
- I prefer to be with equals.

24:29.328 --> 24:33.667
- So, you treat me as an equal?
- You're uncomfortable with that?

24:35.879 --> 24:37.715
I'm not used to it.

24:37.840 --> 24:42.597
I've always been a servant,
not that I'm complaining.

24:42.722 --> 24:46.561
The Sovereign treats me well.
I have all that I could want.

24:46.770 --> 24:48.606
What about freedom?

24:52.319 --> 24:53.905
I can never have that.

24:55.073 --> 24:57.660
- You're owned by the Sovereign?
- No.

24:57.827 --> 25:01.791
I'm not her slave.
I can leave whenever I wish.

25:01.958 --> 25:03.836
But you have no place to go.

25:04.003 --> 25:06.423
Just the opposite.

25:08.468 --> 25:10.679
My path is all too clear.

25:12.307 --> 25:16.605
Yuta, you're an excellent chef,
but you speak in riddles.

25:19.275 --> 25:22.613
I've never been
very good at conversation.

25:26.828 --> 25:28.497
Yuta.

25:33.421 --> 25:38.219
I believe the Sovereign wants me
to return. Enjoy the parthas.

25:47.357 --> 25:51.614
Sickbay to Riker. I've discovered
something interesting.

25:51.781 --> 25:53.074
On my way.

26:00.251 --> 26:02.296
You're scowling, Doctor.

26:02.463 --> 26:04.632
- I'm thinking.
- And?

26:06.510 --> 26:10.850
The old Gatherer on the planet?
I know what caused his heart attack.

26:11.601 --> 26:16.608
The tricorder almost missed it
but he had a microvirus in his body

26:16.775 --> 26:19.446
blocking his
autonomic nerve impulses.

26:19.654 --> 26:22.158
And that stopped his heart?

26:22.283 --> 26:25.454
But here's
the really interesting part.

26:27.708 --> 26:33.090
This microvirus only attaches itself
to cells with very specific DNA.

26:34.008 --> 26:35.218
How specific?

26:36.387 --> 26:40.059
Without knowing more about
their genetics, I can't be sure.

26:40.226 --> 26:41.853
But my guess is,

26:42.062 --> 26:46.902
this virus would only kill
one Acamarian in a million.

26:47.069 --> 26:50.324
- Pretty single-minded bug.
- Too single-minded.

26:50.491 --> 26:54.121
I can't believe
it's a naturally-occurring virus.

26:54.288 --> 26:58.919
- Meaning it was engineered?
- Meaning Volnath was murdered.

27:16.069 --> 27:21.202
Cmdr Riker, Acamar III has granted
you access to their databases.

27:21.369 --> 27:24.665
They are now being transmitted
into our computer.

27:24.790 --> 27:28.963
Good. Notify Dr Crusher when
the medical database is on line.

27:29.130 --> 27:30.924
Riker out.

27:36.933 --> 27:38.310
Come in.

27:39.437 --> 27:41.398
I'm disturbing you.

27:42.983 --> 27:44.319
Not at all.

27:47.156 --> 27:48.992
As...

27:50.619 --> 27:54.500
...the Sovereign has no further need
for my services tonight,

27:54.667 --> 27:57.212
she suggested
I spend some time with you.

27:59.007 --> 28:01.009
What a charming suggestion.

28:03.972 --> 28:06.267
She appreciates the...

28:07.394 --> 28:09.522
...affection you've shown me.

28:10.106 --> 28:11.608
Was I that obvious?

28:13.569 --> 28:15.030
Yes.

28:15.656 --> 28:21.039
I've already dined. Maybe you know
a good Acamarian dessert recipe.

28:26.129 --> 28:28.800
Does that not please you?

28:36.102 --> 28:39.941
Tell me what you want.
I will do anything you wish.

28:40.066 --> 28:41.693
Wait a minute.

28:42.862 --> 28:44.656
I don't understand.

28:44.823 --> 28:47.494
Don't you want me
to give you pleasure?

28:47.619 --> 28:49.204
Not as a servant.

28:50.122 --> 28:51.958
I told you, I prefer equals.

28:52.751 --> 28:54.587
Even in the matters of love?

28:55.714 --> 28:57.842
Especially in matters of love.

28:59.052 --> 29:00.930
I've offended you.

29:01.973 --> 29:05.770
No, I only want to make you
as happy as you want to make me.

29:05.937 --> 29:08.065
You're entitled to that.

29:09.275 --> 29:11.570
No. I'm not.

29:15.117 --> 29:18.705
I do not feel pleasure or passion.

29:19.498 --> 29:22.461
I haven't been able to
for a long time.

29:30.473 --> 29:33.018
I don't know who did this to you.

29:33.936 --> 29:38.025
Or why. But it can change.

29:39.527 --> 29:42.198
I wish it could.

29:42.323 --> 29:44.451
Tonight most of all.

29:46.496 --> 29:47.706
I'm sorry.

30:09.446 --> 30:11.490
A warm welcome from your people.

30:11.657 --> 30:13.076
That's Chorgan's ship.

30:18.292 --> 30:19.961
Shields holding.

30:20.128 --> 30:24.467
Mr Worf, contact Chorgan. Tell him
Brull has brought us to talk.

30:28.891 --> 30:30.643
Chorgan is not responding.

30:33.022 --> 30:36.777
Mr Worf,
can we knock out their shields

30:36.944 --> 30:40.073
without seriously damaging
their ship?

30:40.199 --> 30:44.371
- I believe we can, sir.
- Prepare phasers and open a channel.

30:44.538 --> 30:46.750
Phasers locked. Channel open.

30:46.917 --> 30:50.922
Chorgan, this is Captain
Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterpri...

30:53.468 --> 30:55.220
Alright.

30:56.305 --> 30:58.517
Let's focus their attention.

30:59.310 --> 31:02.272
Mr Worf, fire phasers.

31:08.406 --> 31:11.285
Their forward shields
are inoperative.

31:11.452 --> 31:13.497
Well done, Lieutenant.

31:15.834 --> 31:21.175
- We are being hailed, sir.
- That's better. On screen.

31:22.677 --> 31:27.309
Brull, you traitor! You have
led them here to destroy me!

31:27.475 --> 31:32.316
If I had wanted you destroyed,
you would not be talking to me now.

31:32.483 --> 31:36.363
- Obviously, I wanted something else.
- And what is that?

31:36.530 --> 31:41.120
I have on board Marouk of Acamar III.
Listen to her and Brull.

31:41.287 --> 31:45.043
- She's worth listening to.
- I don't wish to listen.

31:45.209 --> 31:49.424
You have no choice.
We're beaming on board. Picard out.

31:51.176 --> 31:55.391
Cancel red alert. Tell Marouk
to meet me in transporter three.

31:55.516 --> 31:56.893
Aye, sir.

31:57.060 --> 32:00.023
- You're going alone?
- The danger is minimal.

32:00.190 --> 32:04.738
Chorgan won't do anything rash
with our phasers trained on his ship.

32:04.905 --> 32:06.824
There are still risks.

32:07.909 --> 32:10.329
For these negotiations to succeed,

32:10.496 --> 32:13.667
I must be a mediator,
not an enforcer.

32:14.585 --> 32:16.797
You have the bridge, Number One.

32:33.989 --> 32:37.118
Chorgan, this is Sovereign Marouk.

32:38.745 --> 32:40.623
You may sit.

32:48.301 --> 32:50.596
You will find Marouk's proposal...

32:50.763 --> 32:55.645
You know, Picard,
I could take you prisoner.

32:57.064 --> 33:01.236
Oh, don't worry.
I've no intention of doing so.

33:01.403 --> 33:04.825
I know what trouble it's been
for you to get here,

33:05.034 --> 33:06.703
and I am curious why.

33:06.828 --> 33:08.247
Then let's proceed.

33:08.413 --> 33:12.836
Quite simply, I'm proposing
amnesty for every Gatherer.

33:13.003 --> 33:14.756
Amnesty?

33:16.383 --> 33:17.593
You mean slavery.

33:17.802 --> 33:23.769
- If you want to know what I think...
- I don't! Say what you came to say.

33:23.936 --> 33:26.314
I doubt I'll believe you.

33:26.523 --> 33:30.445
I didn't believe
this persuasive Federation Captain

33:30.612 --> 33:33.366
when he suggested reconciliation.

33:33.533 --> 33:39.333
I'm convinced now it's right,
not just for you, but for us, too.

33:39.500 --> 33:40.752
We need you back.

33:45.258 --> 33:48.346
I've brought some Acamarian brandy.

33:49.389 --> 33:51.392
I'm sure it's been a long time.

33:52.602 --> 33:56.358
No! You have spent
a century hunting us down.

33:56.525 --> 34:01.198
- She is trying to end all that.
- Luring us back, putting us in jail.

34:01.365 --> 34:04.077
No, by accepting you back
as free men.

34:04.244 --> 34:06.915
Will you feed us and clothe us, too?

34:07.040 --> 34:08.960
No, of course I won't.

34:09.126 --> 34:13.632
What I will do is give you the means
to feed and clothe yourselves.

34:13.800 --> 34:17.429
We've set aside some land
and you can use it to...

34:20.351 --> 34:21.853
Land?

34:23.563 --> 34:26.485
Do we look like farmers to you?

34:26.652 --> 34:31.284
Then don't farm. Use the land
as you wish. It's yours.

34:31.449 --> 34:35.748
The moment you set foot on it,
you'll be better off.

34:35.956 --> 34:38.002
You won't be running any longer.

34:39.253 --> 34:42.091
- We will need autonomy.
- Autonomy?

34:42.257 --> 34:44.678
We can at least acknowledge

34:44.844 --> 34:48.433
that Chorgan appears willing
to discuss your offer.

34:51.772 --> 34:54.525
There are many levels of autonomy.

34:54.692 --> 34:57.196
Your region
would have certain rights.

34:57.405 --> 35:03.038
Yes. And those rights
will be spelled out

35:03.247 --> 35:05.667
before I agree to anything.

35:06.668 --> 35:10.674
Commander, I am afraid
the only entry we have on Volnath

35:10.799 --> 35:13.887
in the Acamarian database
is a birth record.

35:14.096 --> 35:18.185
Probably one of the last Gatherers
to be born on their planet.

35:18.352 --> 35:19.645
Commander?

35:19.854 --> 35:23.735
I've been searching the medical
database from Acamar III.

35:23.901 --> 35:28.158
I found another victim of
the microvirus that killed Volnath.

35:28.325 --> 35:30.411
But only one.

35:30.620 --> 35:34.667
53 years ago, a Gatherer
named Penthor-Mul.

35:34.834 --> 35:38.631
Data? Anything in your file
on Penthor-Mul?

35:38.798 --> 35:41.583
Yes. He was a member
of the Lornak clan.

35:41.761 --> 35:46.559
He was captured while leading
a raid on an Acamarian outpost.

35:47.227 --> 35:51.066
He died of a heart attack
before his trial ended.

35:51.900 --> 35:55.186
Display Volnath's birth record again.

36:00.955 --> 36:03.208
Lornak. The same clan.

36:03.667 --> 36:07.705
The only two deaths by this
microvirus are from the same clan.

36:07.882 --> 36:09.551
What does that tell us?

36:09.718 --> 36:12.430
If the microbes
are engineered to kill,

36:12.639 --> 36:15.685
I'd say somebody
is going after a whole family.

36:15.852 --> 36:20.275
Commander, Chorgan,
the present leader of the Gatherers,

36:20.483 --> 36:22.361
is also from the Lornak clan.

36:22.528 --> 36:26.534
I want to know how this clan
was involved with the blood feuds

36:26.701 --> 36:29.288
and who their enemies were.

36:29.455 --> 36:33.377
- How is this virus transmitted?
- More ways than I can count.

36:33.544 --> 36:37.508
It's safe to the carrier
as long as he has different DNA.

36:37.675 --> 36:39.428
Tailor-made for enemies.

36:39.595 --> 36:42.588
Commander, 80 years ago,

36:42.724 --> 36:46.479
the Lornaks massacred
a rival clan, the Tralestas.

36:46.605 --> 36:49.317
It ended a feud
that had lasted 200 years.

36:49.432 --> 36:50.527
Ended it?

36:50.736 --> 36:55.367
Records show there were no survivors.
The Tralestas were annihilated.

36:55.576 --> 36:58.872
Something tells me
they weren't all wiped out.

36:59.039 --> 37:01.042
There must be a missing link.

37:01.167 --> 37:06.383
Computer, any members of the
delegation from the Tralesta clan?

37:07.009 --> 37:09.888
Clan affiliation
is not within records.

37:10.723 --> 37:15.772
Sir, I have found a correlation
between the two deaths.

37:16.899 --> 37:19.141
Your missing link.

37:23.617 --> 37:27.539
That is Penthor-Mul
being led from his trial.

37:28.530 --> 37:32.838
- I don't see the connection.
- Behind him and to the left, sir.

37:33.005 --> 37:35.968
Computer, scan left and magnify.

37:39.097 --> 37:43.135
The computer can extrapolate
the rest of the face, sir.

37:43.437 --> 37:44.814
Do it.

37:50.489 --> 37:54.495
But that photograph
was taken over 50 years ago.

37:58.834 --> 38:03.216
53 years ago,
and she hasn't aged a day.

38:14.566 --> 38:17.111
Three seats on the ruling council?

38:17.278 --> 38:21.826
If we are subject to your law,
we want a part in making it.

38:21.993 --> 38:25.498
I agree you're entitled
to representation

38:25.665 --> 38:27.876
but not on the ruling council!

38:28.043 --> 38:32.550
Unacceptable!
The real power is in the council.

38:32.759 --> 38:36.931
- You're shutting us off already.
- You're trying to take too much.

38:37.098 --> 38:41.897
- No group has three seats!
- I don't care what others have!

38:42.095 --> 38:46.028
You only care
about what you can take!

38:46.153 --> 38:50.159
Sovereign,
if the situation were reversed,

38:50.326 --> 38:54.290
I'm sure you would demand
equal levels of representation.

38:56.543 --> 38:58.838
You're right, Captain.

39:00.330 --> 39:02.959
I apologize for my temper.

39:14.736 --> 39:18.909
Perhaps a brief pause
would be helpful.

39:20.411 --> 39:21.830
I agree.

39:25.251 --> 39:27.995
Maybe a little touch of that brandy.

39:28.965 --> 39:29.966
Yuta.

39:31.051 --> 39:32.762
You know... Thank you.

39:32.971 --> 39:37.477
It is remarkable how very much alike
the two of you actually are.

39:37.644 --> 39:39.428
- Ridiculous!
- Captain!

39:39.605 --> 39:40.816
No, I'm serious.

39:40.941 --> 39:44.237
You are both able negotiators,
strong leaders.

39:44.362 --> 39:48.493
- We don't obey weak leaders!
- We haven't agreed to anything.

39:48.660 --> 39:52.749
You're wrong, Chorgan.
We've agreed to have brandy.

39:57.506 --> 39:59.509
- Don't move!
- A trap!

39:59.676 --> 40:05.309
I assure you my First Officer has
a very good reason for his actions.

40:05.435 --> 40:07.479
You do, Number One?

40:08.022 --> 40:11.652
Yuta, move away from Chorgan.

40:11.767 --> 40:13.446
- Do it.
- Why?

40:13.613 --> 40:16.983
Because of a man you once knew
named Penthor-Mul.

40:17.160 --> 40:20.415
Penthor-Mul?
How do you know Penthor-Mul?

40:20.498 --> 40:21.625
Tell him, Yuta.

40:23.377 --> 40:24.712
I don't understand.

40:24.879 --> 40:28.218
You were with Penthor-Mul
when he died.

40:28.343 --> 40:30.429
It was 50 years ago. How...?

40:30.638 --> 40:32.599
I know, Yuta.

40:32.766 --> 40:34.059
Stop!

40:34.174 --> 40:38.107
Chorgan, keep perfectly still.
Your life is in danger.

40:38.775 --> 40:39.974
Step back, Yuta.

40:42.655 --> 40:45.409
- This is not your concern.
- It is now.

40:45.576 --> 40:50.333
- You're about to commit a murder.
- It isn't murder!

40:50.500 --> 40:53.379
- It's justice!
- Who are you?

40:54.631 --> 40:56.717
Yuta of the clan Tralesta.

40:56.926 --> 40:59.252
There are no more Tralestas.

41:00.514 --> 41:03.310
Five survived the last Lornak raid.

41:03.425 --> 41:06.012
But on that day, a century ago,

41:06.982 --> 41:10.727
my life ended and my search began.

41:13.033 --> 41:16.746
I was the one chosen, transformed.

41:17.456 --> 41:19.125
My cells were altered

41:19.918 --> 41:24.341
and my ageing slowed,
enough to finish my task.

41:24.507 --> 41:28.419
You used me in order to get
to the last few you couldn't reach.

41:28.597 --> 41:29.890
Yes, Sovereign.

41:30.099 --> 41:33.562
You will never leave this ship alive.

41:33.729 --> 41:35.941
You're the last.

41:36.108 --> 41:41.282
Once you're dead,
what happens to me doesn't matter.

41:41.407 --> 41:43.118
The wars are over, Yuta.

41:44.829 --> 41:48.000
- You cannot understand.
- You're right, I can't.

41:48.167 --> 41:52.340
Because I've seen the part of you
that regrets what you've become.

41:52.548 --> 41:55.135
You don't have to do this any more.

41:59.099 --> 42:02.813
- I have no choice.
- You do.

42:04.774 --> 42:06.694
William, I...

42:08.571 --> 42:09.865
I'm sorry.

42:11.284 --> 42:12.661
Stop!

42:38.198 --> 42:40.242
Don't do this.

43:05.904 --> 43:09.451
Commander, I am in your debt.

43:37.575 --> 43:39.328
Yes. Thank you.

43:45.118 --> 43:47.006
New orders from Starfleet.

43:47.131 --> 43:51.335
The rendezvous with the Goddard
has been postponed.

43:51.471 --> 43:55.351
- In the meantime?
- Starbase 343.

43:56.092 --> 43:59.983
We're taking medical supplies
for the Alpha Leonis system.

44:00.150 --> 44:02.027
Sounds pretty routine.

44:02.612 --> 44:05.741
With the Gatherer truce in effect,
it should be.

44:07.452 --> 44:10.748
We won't require
a full ship's complement.

44:11.833 --> 44:15.631
I'm going to extend shore leave
to anyone who wants it.

44:19.000 --> 44:22.098
I'll pass that along to the crew,
Captain.
