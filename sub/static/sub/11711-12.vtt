Thank you.
Mm-hm.

18:54.766 --> 18:57.236
Hey, kid,
where'd you get that hotdog?

18:57.236 --> 19:00.739
Uh, the Rubenstein bar mitzvah
has a hotdog cart.

19:00.739 --> 19:02.241
Oh, no.

19:02.241 --> 19:04.976
[♪♪♪♪♪♪]

19:06.178 --> 19:07.513
Don't eat that hotdog.

19:07.513 --> 19:08.614
Audrey.

19:08.614 --> 19:09.981
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

19:09.981 --> 19:11.750
but you've come too far
to give in now.

19:11.750 --> 19:13.185
I thought you said my diet
was stupid.

19:13.185 --> 19:16.288
Well, actually, I'm kind of
in awe of your willpower.

19:16.288 --> 19:17.556
Really?
Yeah,

19:17.556 --> 19:19.558
it's very
"optimal male" of you.

19:19.558 --> 19:20.192
Well, thank you.

19:20.192 --> 19:23.061
And thanks for stopping me.
I won't eat this.

19:23.061 --> 19:23.962
Good.

19:23.962 --> 19:25.197
Just one question.
What?

19:25.197 --> 19:28.767
What do we do
about the seven I already ate?

19:28.767 --> 19:31.470
Let's get you out of here.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.039
Hey. There you are.

19:34.039 --> 19:35.441
Hey.

19:35.441 --> 19:37.576
Why aren't you
with your buddy Drake?

19:37.576 --> 19:38.210
I thought you two

19:38.210 --> 19:40.579
would be snapping towels
at each other by now.

19:40.579 --> 19:43.349
Heh. No, actually,
I ditched him at the bar.

19:43.349 --> 19:44.916
Ditched him?
Yeah.

19:44.916 --> 19:47.085
Drake's, uh,
kind of a douche.

19:47.085 --> 19:47.553
[SCOFFS]

19:47.553 --> 19:50.356
Then why were you palling around
with him?

19:50.356 --> 19:53.158
Well, I was trying to be polite.
I mean, he's your friend.

19:53.158 --> 19:55.927
And I'm sorry,
but I gotta say

19:55.927 --> 19:58.464
that I feel uncomfortable
around him

19:58.464 --> 20:01.032
and having him around you.
It's weird.

20:01.032 --> 20:03.068
I-- I feel kind of...

20:03.068 --> 20:04.436
Jealous?

20:04.436 --> 20:05.871
Is that what this is?

20:05.871 --> 20:09.074
Are you telling me
you've never been jealous?

20:09.074 --> 20:10.842
No, no. Never with any other
girlfriend.

20:10.842 --> 20:12.744
But with you, for some reason,
I am.

20:12.744 --> 20:15.381
Maybe you're special
or something.

20:15.381 --> 20:17.015
[BOTH CHUCKLE]

20:17.015 --> 20:17.716
Hey, should I tell Stacy

20:17.716 --> 20:19.785
she has to find somewhere else
to stay?

20:19.785 --> 20:23.088
That might not be a problem.

20:23.522 --> 20:26.358
I totally agree
with what you said up there.

20:26.358 --> 20:29.595
Leprosy is disgusting.

20:29.595 --> 20:30.496
Yes.

20:30.496 --> 20:33.164
All I know is
if it wasn't for leprosy,

20:33.164 --> 20:36.034
I would never have met you.

20:36.034 --> 20:37.669
So to leprosy?

Never gonna make weight
by Monday.

20:54.320 --> 20:57.323
Aw. You're still
my optimal male.

20:57.323 --> 21:00.559
I'm gonna go get ready
for bed.
