01:42.877 --> 01:44.753
I'm 28 years old.

01:48.049 --> 01:50.467
I've been a carer
for nine years.

01:57.850 --> 01:59.809
And I'm good at my job.

02:00.645 --> 02:03.438
My patients
always do better
than expected

02:03.522 --> 02:05.523
and are hardly
ever classified
as agitated,

02:07.026 --> 02:09.818

about to make a donation.

02:12.823 --> 02:14.783
I'm not trying to boast,

02:14.867 --> 02:17.994
but I feel a great sense
of pride in what we do.

02:18.996 --> 02:21.706

have achieved so much.

we aren't machines.

In the end,
it wears you down.

02:34.887 --> 02:39.349
I suppose that's why
I now spend most of my time
not looking forwards

02:39.433 --> 02:41.601
but looking back,

02:41.686 --> 02:44.896
to The Cottages and Hailsham,

02:45.648 --> 02:47.399

Good morning,
Miss Emily.

04:02.266 --> 04:06.394
It has come to my attention
that three burned cigarettes
were discovered,

04:06.771 --> 04:09.856
hidden behind a pot
in the flower garden.

04:12.151 --> 04:14.319
I know that on occasion
students have seen

04:14.403 --> 04:18.197
some of the caretakers
and deliverymen
smoking cigarettes,

04:18.281 --> 04:22.744
but I must emphasize,
once again,
that it is much, much worse

04:22.828 --> 04:26.331
for a student of Hailsham
to smoke cigarettes
than anyone else.

04:28.709 --> 04:32.086

04:42.807 --> 04:44.933
CHILDREN: Yes, Miss Emily.

04:47.728 --> 04:51.189
RUTH: I think, one day,
I'd like five horses.

I'd like five horses.

Why didn't Tommy
get the ball?

06:26.201 --> 06:27.410
When it bounced
over the fence,

06:27.494 --> 06:28.870
it couldn't have
been far from him.

06:29.538 --> 06:31.915
The fence is the boundary

RUTH: There was once
a boy who had a big row
with all his friends

06:41.425 --> 06:43.801
and then ran off
beyond the boundary.

06:43.886 --> 06:48.097
They found him,
two days later, in the woods.

she wasn't allowed.

11:03.145 --> 11:05.521
I believe I was trying
to calm him down.

11:05.606 --> 11:07.481
Because he seemed upset.

11:07.983 --> 11:11.569
He explained
he was often teased
about sport and art,

11:11.653 --> 11:14.989
so I told him
he shouldn't get upset
about these things.

are only teasing him
to get a reaction.

that he's not particularly
good at sport or art,

40:32.287 --> 40:34.288
and they were in love
with each other,

40:34.373 --> 40:38.209
really properly in love,
and they could prove it,

40:38.877 --> 40:41.796
then they would be given
a few years together

40:42.005 --> 40:44.423
before they began
their donations.

40:47.594 --> 40:49.845
Where did you
hear about this?

40:50.722 --> 40:52.098
When we were
at White Mansion.

40:52.224 --> 40:54.392
People there were
always going on about
this Hailsham couple.

40:55.060 --> 40:56.644
When the guy was
only a few weeks
from donation,

40:56.728 --> 41:00.231
he just went to see someone.
He applied,
and everything got sorted out.

41:00.983 --> 41:04.735
I suppose you lot
would know about
that sort of thing.

41:04.820 --> 41:08.614

you'd know how that
sort of thing works.

things to yourself?

a special arrangement

to put off their donations.

48:43.820 --> 48:46.321
That's what
The Gallery
could be for.

48:47.198 --> 48:49.575
In The Gallery
they have everything
about us they need to know.

48:49.659 --> 48:51.994

we're in love,

into our souls

if it's real love

01:02:41.073 --> 01:02:43.491
Is it the end
of the day already?

01:02:44.868 --> 01:02:46.619
Do you know,
it's funny,

01:02:46.704 --> 01:02:50.999
I think I've thought
about you every day
for the last few months.

01:02:51.083 --> 01:02:53.084
Hoping I'd see you again.

01:02:54.753 --> 01:02:57.588
Do you know,
I felt sure
that I would.

01:02:59.091 --> 01:03:04.178
Seemed impossible
that I'd complete without
seeing you one last time.

01:03:06.598 --> 01:03:09.100
It's not
the last time, Ruth.

01:03:10.102 --> 01:03:11.978
They offered me a bed.

01:03:12.062 --> 01:03:14.439
I was planning on
staying the night anyway.

01:03:14.648 --> 01:03:16.274
Well.

01:03:41.216 --> 01:03:43.718
RUTH: I always knew
you'd be a good carer.

01:03:44.178 --> 01:03:46.304
Your donors
are very lucky.

01:03:51.685 --> 01:03:54.771
Look, I was lying
awake last night

01:03:54.855 --> 01:03:57.815
and I suddenly had
an idea that we'd take
a trip together.

01:03:58.025 --> 01:03:59.817
Where to?

01:04:00.319 --> 01:04:03.196
I hadn't much thought
of where, just a trip.

01:04:07.576 --> 01:04:09.160
Although

01:04:10.746 --> 01:04:12.497
a place
did spring to mind.

01:04:12.581 --> 01:04:15.083
One of the boys
on the other floor
was talking about it.

01:04:15.167 --> 01:04:17.001
It's near the
Kingsfield Recovery Center.

01:04:17.503 --> 01:04:21.005
Is it the boat?
The one left
on the beach?

01:04:21.131 --> 01:04:22.715
You've heard
about it, too?

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:25.343
I heard.
One of the carers
who worked there.

01:04:28.555 --> 01:04:30.306
And do you suppose,

01:04:31.350 --> 01:04:34.560
if we're driving
all that way,

01:04:35.312 --> 01:04:37.605
that we could
call in on Tommy?

01:04:39.733 --> 01:04:41.109
(CHUCKLING)

01:04:41.819 --> 01:04:44.779
Told you I'd been
keeping tabs on you.

01:04:46.490 --> 01:04:47.907
Have you seen him?

01:04:49.159 --> 01:04:50.493
No, not since
The Cottages.

01:04:51.537 --> 01:04:53.162
No, neither have I.

01:04:59.294 --> 01:05:00.795
RUTH: How will
we find him?

01:05:00.879 --> 01:05:03.548
KATHY: His carer said
he'd be waiting outside.

01:05:20.399 --> 01:05:21.899
Look, there he is.

01:05:28.782 --> 01:05:31.993
Do you think
he's recognized us
through the glass?

01:05:34.246 --> 01:05:36.080
No, no, no.

01:05:36.165 --> 01:05:38.166
Let's not get out.

01:05:54.850 --> 01:05:56.017
KATHY: Ruth's
in the car.

01:05:56.101 --> 01:05:57.268
Oh, right.

01:05:57.394 --> 01:05:58.769
Hey!

01:05:59.229 --> 01:06:00.605
Hi!

01:06:02.107 --> 01:06:03.441
Hi.
Hi.

01:06:03.775 --> 01:06:04.817
(CHUCKLES)

01:06:04.902 --> 01:06:05.943
How are you?

01:06:06.028 --> 01:06:07.111
RUTH: I'm good.

01:06:07.446 --> 01:06:08.654
Look at your hair.

01:06:08.739 --> 01:06:10.448
TOMMY: Oh, yeah.
My hair.

01:06:15.412 --> 01:06:16.746
(CHUCKLES)

01:06:18.874 --> 01:06:21.209
I can't quite believe
that I have you both here.

01:06:24.254 --> 01:06:25.838
Does it feel to you
that we're back
at Hailsham again?

01:06:25.923 --> 01:06:28.216
Like no time
has passed?

01:06:28.842 --> 01:06:29.926
No, it doesn't.

01:06:30.010 --> 01:06:31.302
TOMMY: No, it doesn't
at all, does it?

01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:34.472
It really doesn't at all.
It's really weird.

01:06:34.598 --> 01:06:36.224
But a good weird, I think.

01:06:41.104 --> 01:06:44.649
I don't suppose you both heard
that Hailsham was closed?

01:06:47.236 --> 01:06:50.488
The only schools left now,
you hear
they're like battery farms.

01:06:51.532 --> 01:06:53.157
Like Morningdale.

01:06:53.617 --> 01:06:56.661
I'm sure that's
an exaggeration, though.

01:06:58.789 --> 01:07:00.998
Are you sure
we're going
the right way?

01:07:17.182 --> 01:07:18.683
It's locked,
it looks like.

01:07:19.601 --> 01:07:21.102
No one said
anything about this.

01:07:21.186 --> 01:07:22.937
No one said anything
about a locked gate.

01:07:23.021 --> 01:07:25.856
Ruth, just relax.
It's okay.

01:07:34.533 --> 01:07:36.367
Can walk through here.

01:08:04.396 --> 01:08:05.438
Wow.

01:08:18.910 --> 01:08:21.037
Hey, come on.

01:08:41.515 --> 01:08:42.767
(PANTING)

01:08:51.652 --> 01:08:52.734

(COUGHING)

01:09:08.669 --> 01:09:11.796
TOMMY:
I wonder if that's what
Hailsham looks like now.

01:09:14.424 --> 01:09:17.385
Do you ever hear, Kath,
about any of the students
from Hailsham?

01:09:17.469 --> 01:09:19.386
Sometimes, yeah.

01:09:20.889 --> 01:09:25.850
I heard that
Amanda completed
on her first donation.

01:09:26.478 --> 01:09:29.563
I think that happens
more than they ever tell us.

01:09:29.648 --> 01:09:30.648
TOMMY: Hmm.

01:09:30.732 --> 01:09:34.527
Yeah, there was this
guy at my care center

01:09:34.653 --> 01:09:39.657
who was always really
scared of completing
on his first donation.

01:09:40.867 --> 01:09:42.660
But it was all fine.

01:09:42.743 --> 01:09:45.662
And he's just
come through
his third one now,

01:09:46.288 --> 01:09:49.166
and he's completely
all right.

01:09:54.296 --> 01:09:56.424
It's funny,
I don't think...

01:09:57.509 --> 01:09:59.593
Well, I know
I wouldn't have been
a very good carer,

01:09:59.678 --> 01:10:01.721
but in a way
I actually think
I'm quite a good donor.

01:10:01.805 --> 01:10:04.515
(SNICKERS) That's what
we're supposed to be,
isn't it?

01:10:17.070 --> 01:10:18.696
I'd like you
to forgive me.

01:10:21.324 --> 01:10:23.117
I don't expect
you to.

01:10:23.702 --> 01:10:24.827
Forgive you
for what?

01:10:32.127 --> 01:10:34.462
For keeping you
and Tommy apart.

01:10:38.341 --> 01:10:41.635
Should have been
you two together,
I always knew it.

01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:43.971
As far back
as I can remember.

01:10:45.974 --> 01:10:49.393
It wasn't just
because of the rumors
about deferrals.

01:10:53.857 --> 01:10:56.066
It was because
I was jealous.

01:10:58.653 --> 01:11:02.782
You had real love
and I didn't,

01:11:06.578 --> 01:11:09.914
and I didn't want to be
the one that was left alone.

01:11:21.051 --> 01:11:22.718
It's the worst thing
I ever did.

01:11:27.265 --> 01:11:29.600
And now I want
to put it right.

01:11:29.976 --> 01:11:31.685
I don't know
how you can
do that, Ruth.

01:11:32.187 --> 01:11:33.604
I can

01:11:35.106 --> 01:11:36.774
if you two
get a deferral.

01:11:37.776 --> 01:11:39.944
It's too late
for that, Ruth.

01:11:40.445 --> 01:11:43.280
Way too late.
It's stupid to even
think about it.

01:11:43.490 --> 01:11:47.660
It isn't too late.
Look, you'll see,
both of you.

01:11:48.411 --> 01:11:52.957
I wanted to do this trip
because I had something
that I wanted to give you.

01:11:54.417 --> 01:11:56.293
It's Madame's address.

01:11:59.214 --> 01:12:02.925
That's who you apply to.
That's who you have to
go and see.

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:07.513
How did you
get this?

01:12:09.224 --> 01:12:13.018
It wasn't easy,
but I've had years
to think about what I did.

01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:17.648
And years to try and work out
a way to make it right.

01:13:02.694 --> 01:13:05.905
I started doing
them when we were
at The Cottages.

01:13:06.072 --> 01:13:08.574
The day after
we went to find
Ruth's Possible.

01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:11.619
I realized that
if I was ever going to
apply for a deferral,

01:13:11.703 --> 01:13:13.954
then I'd have to
show them something.

01:13:15.373 --> 01:13:18.375
And I've done
hundreds of them
over the years.

01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:21.587
They're wonderful.

01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:23.881
What? Really?

01:13:24.132 --> 01:13:25.549
Yeah.

01:13:27.135 --> 01:13:28.802
Well, thank you.

01:13:30.847 --> 01:13:32.431
(TOMMY CHUCKLES)

01:13:40.941 --> 01:13:44.068
I have never
showed anyone
them until now.

01:13:46.529 --> 01:13:48.614
They were my secret.

01:13:50.325 --> 01:13:53.077
Just like you
and those
porno magazines.

01:13:53.828 --> 01:13:55.496
You remember that?

01:13:55.914 --> 01:13:56.997
Yeah.

01:13:59.501 --> 01:14:01.418
Ruth said
you didn't understand
what I was doing.

01:14:01.503 --> 01:14:03.629
No, I don't think
she understood
what you were doing.

01:14:03.797 --> 01:14:05.798
She thought
you were looking
at the dirty pictures

01:14:05.882 --> 01:14:08.425
in order
to find out about sex

01:14:08.802 --> 01:14:10.094
(SIGHING)

01:14:10.512 --> 01:14:14.139
and to find out what
you were missing out
on or something.

01:14:17.644 --> 01:14:19.186
I knew.

01:14:20.855 --> 01:14:23.983
I knew you were looking
for your Original.

01:14:26.653 --> 01:14:30.447
I used to have
these huge urges
to have sex sometimes.

01:14:31.449 --> 01:14:33.993
And sometimes
they'd be so powerful,

01:14:34.536 --> 01:14:36.453
I just thought
I'd do it with anyone.

01:14:38.957 --> 01:14:41.792
So I thought that
had to tell me something.

01:14:41.918 --> 01:14:44.712
Something about
the kind of person
I was modeled on.

01:14:47.132 --> 01:14:48.799
It's stupid,

01:14:50.385 --> 01:14:53.470
but I guessed the magazines
would be the most likely
place I'd find her.

01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:57.391
You know those urges
are natural, don't you?

01:14:57.475 --> 01:15:01.020
You know all of us had them.
You know that now, right?

01:24:15.199 --> 01:24:17.200
Verifiable. I see.

01:24:23.249 --> 01:24:24.749
Go on.

01:24:25.001 --> 01:24:26.418
Well,

01:24:28.087 --> 01:24:30.714
we'd heard about
the deferrals.

01:24:32.925 --> 01:24:35.677
And we'd worked out
the purpose
of The Gallery.

01:24:37.054 --> 01:24:38.805
Tell me the purpose.

01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:43.685
To use our art
from Hailsham

01:24:43.894 --> 01:24:46.229
to look into
our souls,

01:24:47.273 --> 01:24:50.692
which would verify
that we deserved
a deferral.

01:24:51.402 --> 01:24:54.779
(CHUCKLING)
But the problem is

01:24:54.864 --> 01:24:57.741
I was a little bit
mixed up back then

01:24:57.825 --> 01:25:02.037
and I didn't
really do any art,

01:25:03.706 --> 01:25:06.041
so you never took
anything of mine.

01:25:06.125 --> 01:25:09.586
I know, I know that
that is my fault

01:25:09.670 --> 01:25:12.881
and it is probably
much too late,

01:25:12.965 --> 01:25:14.966
but I brought
some stuff
with me today.

01:25:20.931 --> 01:25:24.017
This is a book
of stuff and...

01:25:36.113 --> 01:25:38.156
Other stuff here.

01:25:41.702 --> 01:25:42.869
(TOMMY MUMBLING)

01:25:42.953 --> 01:25:46.081
Some of them I've done
quite recently,

01:25:47.124 --> 01:25:48.458
and others

01:25:50.419 --> 01:25:53.296
(STUTTERING) were done
several years ago,
so there's a real spread.

01:25:54.590 --> 01:25:57.884
You already have
a load of stuff
from Kath already.

01:25:57.968 --> 01:26:01.012
She got loads of stuff
into The Gallery over
the years, didn't...

01:26:01.138 --> 01:26:02.806
I'm sorry.

01:26:06.143 --> 01:26:08.103
I never know
what to do.

01:26:12.024 --> 01:26:13.650
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

01:26:14.944 --> 01:26:16.820
I'll take it
from here.

01:26:22.702 --> 01:26:24.369
EMILY:
Thank you, George.

01:26:28.833 --> 01:26:31.251
Kathy H and Tommy D.

01:26:31.335 --> 01:26:32.335
(DOOR CLOSING)

01:26:33.003 --> 01:26:34.963
I remember you both.

01:26:35.506 --> 01:26:38.633
Kathy, a bright girl,
and so creative.

01:26:38.926 --> 01:26:42.220
And Tommy, a big heart
and terrible rages.

01:26:46.475 --> 01:26:48.184
You have to understand,

01:26:49.186 --> 01:26:53.773
Hailsham was
the last place to consider
the ethics of donation.

01:26:54.191 --> 01:26:57.569
We used your art to show
what you were capable of.

01:26:58.237 --> 01:27:00.905
To show that donor children
are all but human.

01:27:02.742 --> 01:27:06.703
But we were providing
an answer to a question
no one was asking.

01:27:08.289 --> 01:27:10.498
If you ask people
to return to darkness,

01:27:10.583 --> 01:27:15.086
the days of lung cancer,
breast cancer,
motor neurone disease,

01:27:16.046 --> 01:27:17.922
they'll simply say no.

01:27:21.302 --> 01:27:24.596
We used to get
two or three couples
like you a year.

01:27:26.223 --> 01:27:28.141
Not so much these days.

01:27:28.225 --> 01:27:29.225
(CHUCKLES)

01:27:29.643 --> 01:27:32.145
You're the first
for quite a while.

01:27:36.275 --> 01:27:38.568
To apply
for a deferral?

01:27:46.994 --> 01:27:49.412
There are
no deferrals, Tommy.

01:27:54.418 --> 01:27:58.630
There are no deferrals.
And there never have been.

01:28:09.099 --> 01:28:12.852
We didn't have
The Gallery in order
to look into your souls.

01:28:13.270 --> 01:28:16.481
We had The Gallery
to see if you had
souls at all.

01:28:29.537 --> 01:28:31.204
Do you understand?

01:28:42.091 --> 01:28:43.466
Yes.

01:28:50.307 --> 01:28:53.142
Your drawings
are very good.

01:28:54.478 --> 01:28:56.980
If you want,
I'll keep them.

01:29:59.418 --> 01:30:01.544
Thank you
for talking to us.

01:30:05.382 --> 01:30:07.133
You poor creatures.

01:30:08.928 --> 01:30:10.887
I wish I could help you.

01:31:10.823 --> 01:31:13.449
Sorry, can we stop
for a second?
I need to get out.

01:31:39.476 --> 01:31:41.019
(TOMMY YELLING)

01:33:56.405 --> 01:33:57.780
(INAUDIBLE)

01:34:21.263 --> 01:34:23.848
KATHY: It's been two weeks
since I lost him.

01:34:54.463 --> 01:34:56.672
I've been given my notice now.

01:35:00.510 --> 01:35:03.179
My first donation
is in a month's time.

01:35:11.855 --> 01:35:15.107
I come here and imagine
that this is the spot

01:35:15.192 --> 01:35:19.111
where
everything I've lost since
my childhood has washed up.

01:35:23.075 --> 01:35:26.410
I tell myself
if that were true,

01:35:27.246 --> 01:35:29.580
and I waited long enough,

01:35:30.666 --> 01:35:34.543
then a tiny figure
would appear on the horizon
across the field

01:35:34.711 --> 01:35:38.673
and gradually get larger
until I'd see it was Tommy.

01:35:41.718 --> 01:35:43.302
He'd wave

01:35:43.762 --> 01:35:45.638
and maybe call.

01:35:47.975 --> 01:35:51.018
I don't let the fantasy
go beyond that.

01:35:51.228 --> 01:35:52.561
I can't let it.

01:35:54.690 --> 01:35:58.693
I remind myself
I was lucky to have had
any time with him at all.

01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:05.491
What I'm not sure about

01:36:05.993 --> 01:36:10.579
is if our lives have been
so different from the lives
of the people we save.

01:36:13.542 --> 01:36:15.459
We all complete.

01:36:17.921 --> 01:36:21.632
Maybe none of us
really understand
what we've lived through

01:36:23.593 --> 01:36:26.137
or feel we've had
enough time.

01:42:49.187 --> 01:42:54.608
When we are scattered
afar and asunder

01:42:54.943 --> 01:43:00.155
Parted are those
who are singing today

01:43:00.740 --> 01:43:06.370
When we look back
and forgetfully wonder

01:43:06.871 --> 01:43:12.334
What we were like
in our learning and play

01:43:12.752 --> 01:43:18.257
Oh, the great days
will bring distance enchanted

01:43:18.508 --> 01:43:23.595
Days of fresh air
in the rain and the sun

01:43:24.139 --> 01:43:29.476
How we rejoiced
as we struggled and panted

01:43:29.936 --> 01:43:36.900
Echoes of dreamland,
Hailsham lives on

01:43:42.198 --> 01:43:43.198
