00:03.203 --> 00:06.187
Blake, buddy, there's something
I wanna talk to you about.

00:06.773 --> 00:08.406
- Mary-Louise and I...
- Who?

00:08.475 --> 00:09.741
Ms. Bennigan.

00:09.809 --> 00:11.142
Hello.

00:11.429 --> 00:16.146
We've been spending a lot
of time together, and, well...

00:16.216 --> 00:18.182
she's my girlfriend now.

00:18.251 --> 00:19.817
And because you and I are a team,

00:19.886 --> 00:22.812
I wanna make sure that my
star player's okay with that.

00:24.887 --> 00:26.484
What do you say?

00:29.565 --> 00:31.218
Weird.

00:33.773 --> 00:34.966
Great talk.

00:35.925 --> 00:39.742
synced and corrected by susinz
*www.addic7ed.com*

00:42.343 --> 00:44.142
What's wrong?

00:44.210 --> 00:46.319
If you don't know, then
you're part of the problem.

00:46.344 --> 00:48.011
Okay, I was only asking to be polite.

00:48.079 --> 00:49.379
I really don't care.

00:49.447 --> 00:52.782
I'm seriously outraged.
I started watching the news,

00:52.851 --> 00:54.117
and things are, like, really bad.

00:54.186 --> 00:56.319
Wait, you just started
watching the news?

00:56.388 --> 00:58.454
Yes, ever since
my best friend Kimi died,

00:58.523 --> 00:59.989
I've wanted to make a difference

01:00.058 --> 01:02.725
and become more aware
of the world around me.

01:02.794 --> 01:06.162
Did you guys know immigrants
are treated terribly?

01:06.231 --> 01:08.798
- And as an immigrant myself...
- You're from Indiana.

01:08.867 --> 01:12.648
Yeah, I immigrated from
Indiana to Chicago, Cecelia.

01:12.734 --> 01:13.736
Get woke.

01:13.813 --> 01:15.592
Chelsea, Blake's in your class, right?

01:15.617 --> 01:17.029
I don't know, I think so.

01:17.054 --> 01:19.275
Every year it's just small
people with different faces.

01:19.344 --> 01:21.544
Will you keep an eye on him?
Last night we told him

01:21.613 --> 01:23.246
we're officially dating,
and it was weird.

01:23.315 --> 01:25.415
- Why was it weird?
- Because he said "weird."

01:25.483 --> 01:28.151
Then threw a ball against
the garage for 45 minutes.

01:28.220 --> 01:30.086
It's not surprising.
I mean, it's hard enough

01:30.155 --> 01:32.121
for kids to accept when
their parents start dating

01:32.190 --> 01:34.123
someone new,
let alone their old teacher.

01:34.192 --> 01:36.826
Oh, yeah. Growing up,
my dad went on a date

01:36.895 --> 01:38.461
with my summer swim instructor,

01:38.530 --> 01:39.996
so I set the pool house on fire.

01:40.065 --> 01:42.966
- Deb, that's arson.
- You know how kids are.

01:43.034 --> 01:45.401
Bottom line is,
if the kid doesn't like you,

01:45.470 --> 01:46.703
your relationship is screwed.

01:46.771 --> 01:48.132
That's what I'm afraid of.

01:48.242 --> 01:49.639
But I think if he gets to know me

01:49.708 --> 01:51.234
he'll find out I'm pretty cool.

01:52.644 --> 01:53.743
Uh-huh.

01:56.281 --> 01:58.815
Guys, I need you
to stop painting on the desks.

01:58.883 --> 02:00.650
You said the world was our canvass.

02:00.719 --> 02:02.485
You're sending mixed messages.

02:02.554 --> 02:04.117
No.

02:04.889 --> 02:07.457
The world is seriously so screwed up.

02:07.525 --> 02:09.359
And what're we gonna do about Kim?

02:09.961 --> 02:12.414
Not Kardashian.
The fat, bad one in Korea.

02:12.439 --> 02:14.218
People need to wake up.

02:14.866 --> 02:16.399
It's up to us to change the world.

02:16.468 --> 02:17.767
You are such a hypocrite.

02:17.836 --> 02:19.168
What have you done to change the world?

02:19.237 --> 02:22.171
- All you do is tweet.
- No, I retweet.

02:22.240 --> 02:24.941
That means I agree with
and support others' ideas.

02:25.010 --> 02:26.709
The only way things are
really gonna change

02:26.778 --> 02:28.344
are if people get out
from behind their computers

02:28.413 --> 02:31.047
- and actually do something.
- Ooh, that is good.

02:31.116 --> 02:32.782
- I'm gonna tweet that.
- Stop.

02:32.851 --> 02:35.051
I'm volunteering at
the hospital tomorrow night.

02:35.120 --> 02:37.587
- Why don't you come with me?
- I'm busy.

02:37.656 --> 02:40.421
- Doing what?
- Okay, you got me.

02:41.059 --> 02:42.671
What're you doing at the hospital?

02:42.696 --> 02:44.500
Reading to comatose patients.

02:45.303 --> 02:47.102
Fine, I'm in.

02:47.265 --> 02:49.065
Have you ever seen
"While You Were Sleeping"?

02:49.134 --> 02:51.067
Maybe some rich hottie
with caterpillar eyebrows

02:51.136 --> 02:54.078
will wake up from his coma
and think I'm his fiancÃ©.

02:58.910 --> 03:01.577
Ooh, are we making paper dolls?

03:01.646 --> 03:04.947
I'm surprisingly good
at cutting out tiny shoes.

03:05.016 --> 03:07.664
These digits are
more nimble than they look.

03:08.253 --> 03:10.820
It's not a paper doll.
It's Flat Bradley.

03:11.265 --> 03:13.523
My nephew in Japan mailed him to me.

03:13.591 --> 03:15.792
I have to take photos with him
so his Japanese classmates

03:15.860 --> 03:17.393
can learn about America.

03:17.462 --> 03:19.462
Flat Bradley is such a fun
way for students to learn

03:19.531 --> 03:21.030
about other parts of the world.

03:21.099 --> 03:23.866
I brought my niece's Flat
Bradley to Montauk with me.

03:23.935 --> 03:26.169
I took photos of him playing
grass court tennis

03:26.237 --> 03:28.250
and sipping a mint julep.

03:29.375 --> 03:32.742
What? It was just a sip.
Everybody needs a fun aunt.

03:32.811 --> 03:35.044
Why don't you take
Mr. Bradley to the Bean?

03:35.113 --> 03:37.180
Or to Navy Pier.
Don't you want your nephew

03:37.248 --> 03:39.248
to get the real Chicago experience?

03:39.317 --> 03:41.150
If that was the case, I'd mail him back

03:41.219 --> 03:43.519
with a bullet hole and a note
that said he loved it.

03:43.588 --> 03:45.121
- Deb.
- I'm pregnant.

03:45.190 --> 03:48.195
I'm not gonna drag this scrap
paper all over the city.

03:49.561 --> 03:51.761
You cannot send these photos to Japan.

03:51.830 --> 03:53.796
You're representing America.

03:53.865 --> 03:56.899
And this lighting isn't
doing your coloring any favors.

03:56.968 --> 03:58.167
Why don't you let us help you?

03:58.236 --> 04:00.875
- We live for photography.
- You do?

04:00.900 --> 04:02.772
We're currently photoshopping ourselves

04:02.841 --> 04:05.174
into Anne Geddes images
for our Christmas card.

04:05.243 --> 04:08.644
You're gonna die when you see
Toby napping in a watermelon.

04:08.713 --> 04:11.514
- Adorable.
- Oh, this will be great.

04:11.583 --> 04:13.084
We'll photoshop you and Flat Bradley

04:13.109 --> 04:14.317
into Chicagoland hot spots,

04:14.386 --> 04:16.242
and we can take the photos
right here at school.

04:16.414 --> 04:17.587
Okay, fine.

04:17.654 --> 04:20.223
As long as it's easy and
I don't have to go anywhere.

04:20.291 --> 04:21.524
So easy.

04:21.593 --> 04:23.526
I'll start pulling images
from the internet

04:23.595 --> 04:24.927
and calculate the direction of the light

04:24.996 --> 04:26.023
in the source material.

04:26.048 --> 04:27.698
I'll put together a mobile light package

04:27.799 --> 04:29.232
and round up foreground elements

04:29.300 --> 04:30.967
once we've locked our backgrounds.

04:31.035 --> 04:32.568
This is gonna be a hoot.

04:37.008 --> 04:38.841
Thanks for watching
Blake and his friends.

04:38.910 --> 04:40.610
I didn't wanna cancel scary movie night

04:40.678 --> 04:43.179
just because a possum is
stranded in a highway median.

04:43.248 --> 04:45.181
No problem. It'll be a blast.

04:45.250 --> 04:48.217
Plus I have some spooky
party tricks up my sleeve.

04:48.286 --> 04:50.286
You don't have to entertain them.

04:50.355 --> 04:51.718
They'll just be watching the movie.

04:51.743 --> 04:53.421
Be back in a few hours.

05:01.966 --> 05:03.699
- Who's hungry?
- Shh.

05:03.768 --> 05:05.201
We're watching the movie.

05:05.270 --> 05:08.137
I just wanted to bring you
some snacks, but it's funny,

05:08.206 --> 05:12.475
all the food in the kitchen
mysteriously disappeared.

05:12.544 --> 05:15.511
So I had to go outside
and dig up some...

05:15.580 --> 05:18.347
mud and worms!

05:18.416 --> 05:21.210
Jeez, my grandma got me these pants.

05:22.921 --> 05:25.710
I vant to suck your bl...

05:27.000 --> 05:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:39.871 --> 05:41.304
Hello?

05:41.372 --> 05:45.975
What do you mean have
I checked the children?

05:46.044 --> 05:47.577
Seriously, stop.

05:47.645 --> 05:50.746
Did you just say the calls
are coming from...

05:50.815 --> 05:52.765
inside the house?

05:53.337 --> 05:58.173
Ah!

06:01.092 --> 06:02.792
That doesn't even make sense.

06:02.861 --> 06:04.260
So the scary guy that was calling

06:04.329 --> 06:06.596
just told you he was
calling from inside the house?

06:06.664 --> 06:09.296
We've practically missed
the whole movie because of you.

06:09.321 --> 06:10.466
Well, you're not missing much.

06:10.535 --> 06:12.268
Billy Bob and the killer
decapitate each other

06:12.337 --> 06:14.170
at the exact same time at the end.

06:14.239 --> 06:17.188
- Ugh.
- Are you kidding me?

06:19.571 --> 06:20.904
I'll go now.

06:24.182 --> 06:26.816
- Your mom sucks.
- She's not my mom.

06:26.885 --> 06:29.485
She's just some lady my dad likes.

06:36.657 --> 06:39.024
Blake's really excited
to go camping this weekend.

06:39.092 --> 06:41.500
He's been collecting spiders
all week to throw in the fire.

06:41.525 --> 06:42.719
Mm-hmm.

06:43.664 --> 06:45.047
Is everything okay?

06:46.433 --> 06:48.313
I don't think Blake likes me.

06:48.852 --> 06:50.602
Is this because of his
reaction when I told him

06:50.671 --> 06:53.657
that you were my girlfriend?
Don't take that personally.

06:53.682 --> 06:55.140
He can't emote while he's eating.

06:55.208 --> 06:57.475
No, it's more than that.

06:57.544 --> 07:00.766
Last night I tried bonding with
him, but he wasn't interested.

07:01.348 --> 07:03.048
I just don't know how this is gonna work

07:03.116 --> 07:04.883
if your son doesn't like me.

07:04.951 --> 07:08.887
Oh, no, this is over, isn't it?
You're gonna break up with me.

07:08.955 --> 07:10.755
Oh, no, I can't believe it's over.

07:10.824 --> 07:12.657
Whoa, calm down.

07:12.726 --> 07:14.259
I am not breaking up with you.

07:14.328 --> 07:16.618
Blake just needs to get
to know you better.

07:17.993 --> 07:19.597
Why don't you come with us this weekend?

07:19.666 --> 07:21.700
Camping? I don't know.

07:21.768 --> 07:23.301
I've never really been before.

07:23.370 --> 07:26.404
- What about Rapture Camp?
- That's not really camping.

07:26.473 --> 07:28.473
We just leave behind all of
our earthly possessions

07:28.542 --> 07:29.874
and wait in the woods.

07:29.943 --> 07:32.143
Well, this is gonna be
a little bit different.

07:32.212 --> 07:34.746
- Okay. Do I need a gun?
- No.

07:34.815 --> 07:36.047
- For snakes?
- Nope.

07:36.116 --> 07:37.482
Okay, I guess if I see a snake,

07:37.551 --> 07:39.071
I'll just bash it
over the head with a rock.

07:41.126 --> 07:45.229
"Li Min sat alone in the
corner of her damp, dank cell.

07:45.321 --> 07:48.256
"Was she truly alive if she
couldn't go where she wanted,

07:48.324 --> 07:50.391
"communicate with people she loved?

07:50.460 --> 07:52.326
"She found herself praying for death,

07:52.395 --> 07:55.129
"a sweet release from
her meaningless life."

07:57.672 --> 07:59.700
- Chelsea, wake up.
- Oh.

07:59.769 --> 08:01.569
- What?
- You fell asleep.

08:01.638 --> 08:04.790
I'm sorry, but your reading
is putting me into a coma.

08:04.961 --> 08:07.074
Do you wanna read the next chapter?

08:07.143 --> 08:09.176
This lady doesn't even know we're here.

08:09.374 --> 08:10.507
What's the point of giving back

08:10.532 --> 08:11.846
if they can't even say "thank you"?

08:11.914 --> 08:12.947
She can hear us.

08:13.016 --> 08:14.115
We should be doing something

08:14.183 --> 08:15.883
that will actually help these people.

08:18.655 --> 08:20.407
There you go...

08:21.024 --> 08:24.292
Janice. You look beautiful.

08:24.360 --> 08:26.961
- What're you doing?
- Giving Janice a makeover.

08:27.030 --> 08:28.329
Why would anyone wanna wake up

08:28.398 --> 08:29.897
when they look like a cold, dead fish.

08:29.966 --> 08:32.789
Now she looks beautiful and fierce.

08:33.243 --> 08:34.750
Isn't that right, Janice?

08:36.839 --> 08:38.873
See? She likes it.

08:40.243 --> 08:41.890
Give me a smile, Deb.

08:42.879 --> 08:45.680
Now, Deb, think about the hot dog.

08:45.748 --> 08:48.616
- What?
- The genuine Chicago dog.

08:48.685 --> 08:51.285
- Think about it.
- You can smell the hot dog.

08:51.354 --> 08:54.055
- Mm-hmm.
- It smells like summer,

08:54.123 --> 08:56.891
like childhood, like America.

08:56.959 --> 08:59.894
And this makes you proud. Be proud, Deb.

09:02.612 --> 09:04.071
That's your proud?

09:05.134 --> 09:08.079
- She's not delivering.
- I know. Okay.

09:08.774 --> 09:09.904
Forget pride.

09:09.972 --> 09:13.240
Uh, you're a fiery Chicago broad

09:13.508 --> 09:15.943
who curses every third word.

09:16.012 --> 09:17.278
That's it, yes.

09:17.347 --> 09:18.779
And all you want is that hot dog,

09:18.848 --> 09:20.281
so you gotta go out
and get that hot dog.

09:20.350 --> 09:21.916
Look at the dog. Look at the dog.

09:21.984 --> 09:23.918
- Yeah.
- Look at the dog.

09:23.943 --> 09:24.996
Look at the dog.

09:30.026 --> 09:31.457
That's really nice, hon,

09:31.482 --> 09:33.294
but I don't think we'll use it.

09:33.363 --> 09:35.425
Yeah, there's not even a river.

09:36.894 --> 09:38.999
Oh, well, I blew it up anyway.

09:39.068 --> 09:40.222
Just in case.

09:41.339 --> 09:44.271
Oh! And I brought this
water filtration bottle

09:44.340 --> 09:46.807
that can recycle urine
into potable water.

09:46.876 --> 09:48.743
I could go now and in ten minutes

09:48.811 --> 09:50.128
we could all have a glass.

09:50.647 --> 09:52.247
Oh, we have drinking water.

09:52.448 --> 09:55.149
Why don't you and Blake
go gather some sticks

09:55.218 --> 09:56.596
while I finish pitching the tent?

09:56.621 --> 09:59.320
Okay. Come on, partner.

09:59.389 --> 10:01.288
Why are you talking like a cowboy?

10:01.357 --> 10:04.258
I have no idea. Now, giddy up.

10:04.480 --> 10:05.926
I'm sorry.

10:05.995 --> 10:08.714
Dagnabbit... ah, I did it again.

10:14.103 --> 10:15.925
It's all about the volume, Irma.

10:16.539 --> 10:19.006
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

10:19.075 --> 10:20.902
Nurse, help.

10:21.911 --> 10:23.144
Thank God you're here.

10:23.212 --> 10:25.579
I can't leave her with half a blowout.

10:32.789 --> 10:34.054
What're you doing?

10:34.123 --> 10:35.746
Throwing away the tree garbage.

10:36.222 --> 10:37.816
The sticks are for the fire.

10:38.238 --> 10:41.028
Oh, right.

10:41.097 --> 10:43.164
Do you see that? It's a barn owl.

10:43.232 --> 10:45.366
- What?
- A barn owl.

10:45.435 --> 10:47.134
Oh, I can't believe
I'm seeing one in person.

10:47.203 --> 10:48.469
And she's a female.

10:48.538 --> 10:50.070
You can tell by her spotted chest.

10:50.139 --> 10:52.840
Wow, she's beautiful.

10:52.909 --> 10:54.375
Did you know barn owls don't hoot?

10:54.444 --> 10:57.077
They screech, like this,.

10:57.146 --> 10:58.546
How do you know so much about them?

10:58.614 --> 11:00.014
I got really interested in owls

11:00.082 --> 11:02.136
after my mom got a job at Hooters.

11:03.686 --> 11:05.085
You know what animal I love?

11:05.154 --> 11:06.855
The black-bellied whistling duck.

11:07.011 --> 11:08.889
I think it's really funny
a duck can whistle.

11:08.958 --> 11:10.124
Yeah, those are cool.

11:10.193 --> 11:11.492
You know what other animal I like?

11:11.561 --> 11:14.161
Tortoises. They can live to be over 100.

11:14.230 --> 11:15.896
One time at the zoo,
I saw two of them humping.

11:15.965 --> 11:17.331
And no one stopped me,

11:17.400 --> 11:18.866
so I just stood
and watched them forever.

11:26.652 --> 11:28.542
Caroline, I see another nose hair.

11:28.611 --> 11:30.511
- It's really pulling focus.
- Well, I know.

11:30.580 --> 11:32.379
But every time I pluck one,
another one sprouts up.

11:32.448 --> 11:34.448
- Okay, we're done.
- Oh.

11:34.517 --> 11:36.217
I'm tired, sweaty, and my baby

11:36.285 --> 11:38.052
is tap dancing on my bladder.

11:38.120 --> 11:40.454
But we haven't even gotten
to the Navy Pier shot.

11:40.523 --> 11:42.316
- No, give me the camera.
- Oh.

11:45.332 --> 11:49.196
Damn, I am one beautiful bitch.

11:49.265 --> 11:51.509
Told you. Toby's amazing.

11:51.534 --> 11:52.900
Oh.

11:52.925 --> 11:56.237
Okay, well, I guess we can keep going.

11:56.949 --> 11:59.240
Caroline, more hairspray.

11:59.308 --> 12:01.519
You missed some fly-aways
in some of those shots.

12:01.566 --> 12:04.712
Pump up the lip gloss,
and where is the lint roller?

12:04.780 --> 12:07.848
I'm not a carpet, people.
I shouldn't look like one.

12:09.785 --> 12:11.619
So, how's everything going with Blake?

12:11.687 --> 12:14.889
Actually, really well.
We saw a barn owl.

12:14.957 --> 12:17.424
Oh, sounds like a hoot.

12:17.493 --> 12:18.996
My famous chili's ready.

12:19.808 --> 12:22.429
Oh, I'm afraid I'll have to pass.

12:22.498 --> 12:24.417
I don't do too well with chili.

12:26.136 --> 12:27.301
Fine.

12:27.370 --> 12:28.936
I don't know why I carried
chili for three

12:29.005 --> 12:30.472
in my backpack all day.

12:32.355 --> 12:34.746
You know what? I'd love some.

12:40.449 --> 12:43.253
Mmm. This is good.

12:43.519 --> 12:45.185
This is really good. Who are you?

12:45.254 --> 12:46.987
Emeril Lagasse? Bam!

12:47.056 --> 12:48.589
Paula Deen? Add some butter.

12:48.658 --> 12:50.991
Guy Fieri? Flavortown, population: me.

12:51.060 --> 12:52.167
Ah.

12:53.796 --> 12:55.128
Mmm.

12:55.496 --> 12:57.363
Can I have another bowl?

12:57.770 --> 12:59.792
Whoa. Okay.

13:08.852 --> 13:12.347
Okay, ready? One, two, three.

13:14.617 --> 13:17.017
Damn, girl, do they have you
on hair gummies?

13:17.347 --> 13:19.050
This is narsty.

13:22.058 --> 13:23.675
Oh, my God. Dorothy?

13:24.994 --> 13:27.227
Dorothy? She's awake.

13:27.296 --> 13:28.957
Dorothy woke up.

13:30.300 --> 13:32.511
I waxed her out of her coma.

13:36.387 --> 13:38.167
The "Star Wars" movies are the best.

13:38.192 --> 13:39.555
It's so stupid people argue about

13:39.623 --> 13:41.156
whether they're boiler plate stories

13:41.225 --> 13:43.125
following a simple
Joseph Campbell hero template,

13:43.194 --> 13:45.661
or explorations of
the Judeo-Christian motif

13:45.729 --> 13:46.895
of good versus evil.

13:46.964 --> 13:48.897
They're both those things and more.

13:48.966 --> 13:50.999
I'll have to watch them some time.

13:51.174 --> 13:52.440
We can watch them when we get home.

13:52.465 --> 13:54.323
Yeah, we have all nine on Blu-ray.

13:59.443 --> 14:04.279
Mmm, these s'mores are yummy.

14:07.191 --> 14:09.758
He took the girl home,
but when he got out

14:09.826 --> 14:11.660
to open the car door for her...

14:11.728 --> 14:14.761
Uh, what? What happened?

14:15.371 --> 14:18.233
Hanging from the car door handle...

14:18.589 --> 14:22.253
...was a bloody metal hook.

14:23.322 --> 14:25.425
Ah!

14:26.043 --> 14:28.243
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

14:28.312 --> 14:29.792
I got scared.

14:41.625 --> 14:43.792
This mile isn't feeling so magnificent.

14:43.817 --> 14:46.051
I'm shiny, I need more powder.

14:46.076 --> 14:47.842
I just powdered you.

14:47.867 --> 14:49.667
I can't even see Flat Bradley.

14:49.692 --> 14:52.230
Can you just rotate
to your left, please?

14:52.255 --> 14:54.322
No. Caroline, get me water.

14:54.504 --> 14:55.683
She's so mean.

14:55.708 --> 14:57.408
I even went out
and bought her that lovely top

14:57.433 --> 14:59.366
and floral-print scarf from JC Penney

14:59.391 --> 15:01.224
and this is how she treats us?

15:01.279 --> 15:02.578
My Spanx are riding up.

15:02.710 --> 15:04.843
Okay, what do you want me to do?

15:04.868 --> 15:06.097
Get in there.

15:09.731 --> 15:10.887
Go deep.

15:13.426 --> 15:15.156
It's really muggy up here.

15:15.225 --> 15:17.692
You know what?
Maybe we can call it a night.

15:17.761 --> 15:20.605
- We've already done 14 setups.
- Fine.

15:21.932 --> 15:25.834
But not until Bradley and I
have our candlelit dinner

15:25.902 --> 15:28.184
at Gibson's Steakhouse.

15:31.074 --> 15:32.809
Flat Bradley.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.166
- Help!
- Oh.

15:34.191 --> 15:36.402
Mm. Let him burn.

15:36.580 --> 15:39.214
Ah... Oh, no.

15:39.283 --> 15:40.644
Oh, God.

15:41.084 --> 15:44.085
We can't thank you enough for
bringing my mother back to us.

15:44.110 --> 15:45.176
It's my pleasure.

15:45.201 --> 15:46.600
I was just looking to give back.

15:46.625 --> 15:48.625
I never thought I'd give back life.

15:48.650 --> 15:51.218
Oh, and FYI, tell Dorothy,
with her small eyes,

15:51.243 --> 15:52.840
she should go easy on the eyeliner.

15:53.175 --> 15:54.207
Okay.

15:54.246 --> 15:57.032
Cecelia, I'm so glad you
brought me here.

15:57.100 --> 15:58.566
I can't promise I'll be able to fix

15:58.635 --> 16:00.068
all the patients tonight, but...

16:00.137 --> 16:01.636
You don't really think you're
responsible

16:01.705 --> 16:02.737
for waking her up, do you?

16:02.806 --> 16:03.957
Listen, Cecelia.

16:04.223 --> 16:06.574
I'm sorry that I'm better
at volunteering than you are.

16:06.643 --> 16:09.379
- It's not a competition.
- Okay, but I did win.

16:09.777 --> 16:11.846
I think if you put more thought
into your work

16:11.871 --> 16:13.204
you'd get better results.

16:13.229 --> 16:14.762
- More thought?
- Yeah.

16:15.252 --> 16:18.320
I spent eight years with
these people, reading to them,

16:18.388 --> 16:20.137
making sure that they know
they're not alone,

16:20.162 --> 16:22.424
trying to give them
a better quality of life.

16:22.492 --> 16:24.793
All you did was show up
and do what was fun for you.

16:24.861 --> 16:26.294
Please do not lecture me.

16:26.363 --> 16:28.596
All you've done is read boring
ass books for years,

16:28.665 --> 16:30.031
and what's the most that's happened?

16:30.100 --> 16:31.366
Someone's farted?

16:31.435 --> 16:33.335
This morning when you came
into the teacher's lounge

16:33.403 --> 16:35.937
talking about the state of the
world and all its injustices,

16:36.006 --> 16:39.240
I thought maybe, just maybe,
she really is changing.

16:39.309 --> 16:41.262
Maybe she really does
wanna make a difference.

16:41.312 --> 16:42.863
But I should've known better.

16:43.465 --> 16:46.132
You've never done a selfless
act in your entire life.

16:46.483 --> 16:48.777
I don't know why I expected
this to be any different.

17:05.402 --> 17:06.605
Oh.

17:10.607 --> 17:11.894
Ah...

17:16.645 --> 17:18.582
Blake. No.

17:22.050 --> 17:23.718
Mm, hmm.

17:23.787 --> 17:25.819
Hey, what's going on?

17:25.888 --> 17:28.390
Dad, I wanna go home. I'm scared.

17:28.458 --> 17:31.326
Is this about the hook?
It's just an urban legend.

17:31.395 --> 17:33.121
I wanna leave. Now.

17:34.139 --> 17:36.652
Okay, buddy. Okay, yeah, we can go.

17:44.174 --> 17:46.176
Dr. McCoy, pick up on line one.

17:46.598 --> 17:48.943
Thanks for taking
a second shift, ladies.

17:49.012 --> 17:53.047
We live to serve so others... can live.

17:53.116 --> 17:54.416
Hmm.

17:54.484 --> 17:57.199
Hi, I'm John Williams with
the "Chicagoland Gazette".

17:57.521 --> 17:59.354
Well, hello there, John Williams.

17:59.423 --> 18:00.989
I'm doing a story on Dorothy Sullivan

18:01.057 --> 18:02.490
coming out of her coma, and
I've been told

18:02.559 --> 18:04.527
that you were with her
when she first woke up.

18:04.552 --> 18:06.085
I would love to get some quotes
for the piece.

18:06.147 --> 18:08.981
Mmm, I would love to give you some.

18:14.237 --> 18:16.777
But the person you should
really talk to is Cecelia.

18:17.874 --> 18:19.441
Cecelia's been by Dorothy's side,

18:19.509 --> 18:21.976
and many of these other
patients' for years.

18:22.045 --> 18:24.668
If you wanna know their story,
you should talk to her.

18:25.282 --> 18:26.981
Are you sure about this, Chelsea?

18:27.050 --> 18:28.383
I know it's your New Year's resolution

18:28.452 --> 18:30.059
- to get your name in print.
- I know,

18:30.084 --> 18:32.053
but I thought about what you
said and you're right.

18:32.122 --> 18:34.422
This isn't about me.
This is about Dorothy.

18:34.491 --> 18:36.891
And I think she would want you
to tell her story.

18:36.960 --> 18:38.359
Plus, girl, it's a great way for you

18:38.428 --> 18:40.637
to get your message out there
about volunteering.

18:41.338 --> 18:43.790
These patients really need more
people like you.

18:43.825 --> 18:45.055
Aw.

18:48.728 --> 18:51.611
- Oh, hi, Blake.
- Mm, my dad's not home.

18:51.775 --> 18:54.053
Actually, I wanted to talk to you.

18:55.057 --> 18:56.523
Okay?

18:56.592 --> 19:00.794
I'm so sorry about everything you saw.

19:01.073 --> 19:03.573
I think it's obvious
why you were scared.

19:03.642 --> 19:05.791
You saw a lot.

19:06.010 --> 19:07.978
And I completely understand

19:08.047 --> 19:10.380
if you never wanna be around me again.

19:10.449 --> 19:12.082
I wasn't scared.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.051
I just figured you'd rather
use the bathroom at home,

19:14.119 --> 19:15.685
so I lied to get us out of there.

19:15.754 --> 19:17.487
I didn't want you to have to tell my dad

19:17.556 --> 19:19.256
you had explosive diarrhea.

19:19.324 --> 19:20.957
Wow, thank you, Blake.

19:21.026 --> 19:23.593
That was incredibly kind of you.

19:23.662 --> 19:25.362
Also, that was a pretty
cool way to poop.

19:25.431 --> 19:27.531
Climbing up on top of
the trash can like that.

19:27.599 --> 19:29.566
That's what raccoons do.

19:29.635 --> 19:31.802
Uh, do me a favor

19:31.870 --> 19:35.471
and don't ever tell anyone you saw that.

19:36.106 --> 19:37.197
Okay?

19:39.745 --> 19:41.617
It's amazing how much you
can learn by giving back

19:41.642 --> 19:43.213
to your community.
When I first started voluntee...

19:43.282 --> 19:44.581
Code blue, code blue.

19:44.650 --> 19:46.349
Some idiot put makeup on Mrs. Gilmore

19:46.418 --> 19:48.919
so nobody noticed she was cyanotic.

19:48.987 --> 19:51.321
When we wiped it off,
she was completely blue.

19:52.991 --> 19:55.658
We gotta get out of here.
Is there a back exit?

19:56.408 --> 19:58.539
Mrs. Gilmore, don't forget your makeup.
