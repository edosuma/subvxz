00:05.254 --> 00:08.574
- Which planet is this again?
- M5V-801.

00:08.693 --> 00:10.395
The one with the frequent tremors.

00:10.515 --> 00:12.675
Not to mention an abnormally high
amount of people with

00:12.795 --> 00:15.465
- debilitating respiratory problems.
- It's a mining planet.

00:15.585 --> 00:17.946
- It's not that surprising.
- Not everyone worked in the mines.

00:18.066 --> 00:19.955
- Get to the point.
- They're experiencing

00:20.075 --> 00:21.666
upwards of four tremors a day.

00:21.786 --> 00:24.134
My seismic team has concluded
the area of their settlement

00:24.254 --> 00:26.594
- is dangerously unstable.
- Not to mention my environmental

00:26.714 --> 00:28.884
and air quality tests
came back way into the red.

00:29.004 --> 00:31.076
My analysis was enough. Thank you.

00:31.196 --> 00:33.245
Well, obviously,
it wasn't enough for them.

00:33.365 --> 00:35.426
These people have said
they've experienced tremors

00:35.546 --> 00:38.526
- for as long as they can remember.
- They've been breathing even longer,

00:38.646 --> 00:40.595
so again, my problem trumps yours.

00:40.715 --> 00:42.216
This not a contest.

00:42.465 --> 00:45.205
They're living in a settlement
that's not safe for habitation.

00:45.325 --> 00:48.335
You need to convince them to move
to another part of the continent.

00:48.455 --> 00:50.476
Well, we tried. It's not working.

00:50.596 --> 00:51.500
Why not?

00:52.705 --> 00:54.767
20 years ago, the Genii
kind of took over the planet,

00:54.887 --> 00:56.624
employed them all as miners.

00:56.744 --> 00:58.395
- Mining what?
- Haven't a clue.

00:58.555 --> 01:00.772
Whatever it was,
they cleaned out the deposits and left.

01:01.226 --> 01:01.965
So?

01:02.085 --> 01:04.483
So, they think we're like the Genii,
and they want their cut.

01:05.645 --> 01:08.225
They're willing to move,
but they have a list of demands

01:08.345 --> 01:09.654
a mile and a half long.

01:09.774 --> 01:11.415
And negotiating with alien settlements

01:11.535 --> 01:13.307
is not exactly why
I joined the Air Force.

01:13.744 --> 01:15.412
<i>We were hoping if you had some time...</i>

01:15.572 --> 01:18.065
You'd save us a lot of time
in the back and forth.

01:18.835 --> 01:20.250
I'll free up my afternoon.

01:20.845 --> 01:22.168
Appreciate that, Colonel.

01:23.175 --> 01:24.580
Jennifer, Rodney.

01:25.275 --> 01:27.576
<i>I'll meet you
at the Gate in one hour.</i>

01:27.696 --> 01:29.765
I was rather hoping
you'd go by yourself,

01:29.885 --> 01:31.302
- and I wouldn't...
- One hour.

01:46.815 --> 01:47.715
Man...

01:48.214 --> 01:50.415
I got to start doing more cardio.

01:50.939 --> 01:52.038
All this...

01:52.316 --> 01:54.617
back and forth is getting me winded.

01:55.626 --> 01:59.015
- We couldn't have taken the Jumper?
- Oh, suck it up. It's not that bad.

01:59.135 --> 02:00.895
I have to hike this much
almost every day.

02:01.015 --> 02:03.276
- You do?
- Yeah, I'm a very active person.

02:03.396 --> 02:04.198
You are?

02:04.318 --> 02:06.576
Your last physical
would kind of contradict you.

02:06.696 --> 02:08.476
That is private medical information

02:08.596 --> 02:10.304
that should not be so cavalierly shared

02:10.424 --> 02:12.336
in casual conversation, Doctor.

02:12.456 --> 02:14.585
I don't think it comes
as a great surprise

02:14.705 --> 02:17.174
- to the Colonel.
- That's not the point! I'm no Ronon.

02:17.294 --> 02:19.723
I'm not going to be on the cover of
Shape Magazine anytime soon,

02:19.843 --> 02:22.875
but I can handle myself in combat...
stay on my ground when I need to...

02:23.444 --> 02:25.142
- Rodney!
- Don't move.

02:27.308 --> 02:30.304
Get down on your stomach,
spread out your weight.

02:31.856 --> 02:32.758
Rodney?

02:33.464 --> 02:34.657
Are you all right?

02:37.696 --> 02:39.537
- Oh, thank God.
- Don't move, okay?

02:40.025 --> 02:41.226
Not a problem.

02:42.126 --> 02:44.584
We're going to head back to the Gate,
try to get some help.

02:44.744 --> 02:46.609
Just try to stay as still...

04:03.573 --> 04:04.562
Don't move...

04:04.682 --> 04:06.896
 if you feel any shooting pains.

04:07.016 --> 04:09.624
I would never move
if that was the case.

04:13.545 --> 04:15.925
Well, it doesn't look like
any of us are bleeding.

04:16.084 --> 04:17.583
At least externally.

04:19.125 --> 04:20.527
That's a Godsend.

04:26.645 --> 04:29.852
This whole place is a tetanus shot
waiting to happen.

04:33.715 --> 04:35.524
In fact, where the hell are we?

04:35.644 --> 04:38.066
I'd guess the Genii mining facility.

04:38.696 --> 04:40.950
Just don't build 'em
like they used to, huh?

04:41.110 --> 04:44.008
I am particularly not fond
of the ceiling work.

04:45.584 --> 04:48.291
If this is part of a larger facility...

04:48.451 --> 04:52.050
Then there should be a way
for us walk out of here. Right.

05:02.543 --> 05:04.009
A little help here?

05:05.777 --> 05:09.062
- What about this one?
- Well, red means bad.

05:10.916 --> 05:12.816
Can't argue with that logic.

05:16.854 --> 05:18.143
Did you see this?

05:18.793 --> 05:21.374
That's not going to budge
unless we enter the right code.

05:21.494 --> 05:23.826
Look, these symbols
are Genii numerals.

05:23.986 --> 05:26.485
Yeah, but...
You can crack the code, though, right?

05:26.605 --> 05:28.897
- Would be a lot easier...
- ... if it was electronic.

05:29.017 --> 05:30.906
- Like he say's.
- Like she say's.

05:31.026 --> 05:33.252
<i>- It's not impossible, though, right?
- No, no...</i>

05:33.412 --> 05:35.815
It's just...
highly, highly unlikely.

05:36.295 --> 05:39.550
Okay, so...
door number two?

05:41.824 --> 05:43.225
After you, Monty.

05:51.846 --> 05:52.846
On three.

05:52.966 --> 05:55.035
One... two... three.

05:58.556 --> 06:00.153
There goes that plan.

06:00.565 --> 06:02.567
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

06:10.725 --> 06:13.188
Okay, three?
One, two, three... go!

06:20.283 --> 06:21.003
<i>Wait.</i>

06:22.824 --> 06:23.826
What if...

06:24.303 --> 06:27.000
What if that door
was sealed for a reason.

06:27.605 --> 06:28.308
<i>What?</i>

06:28.468 --> 06:30.518
You think maybe there's
a scary monster back there?

06:31.337 --> 06:33.534
No, but this is a mining facility,

06:33.966 --> 06:36.399
and who knows what kind
of toxins are in there.

06:37.576 --> 06:40.278
Like you said, "red means bad."

06:45.545 --> 06:47.076
I'm willing to take the chance.

07:08.797 --> 07:10.850
I guess in Genii red means "screwed."

07:15.771 --> 07:16.768
Okay.

07:24.816 --> 07:26.316
Okay, look, it's...

07:26.631 --> 07:28.601
We've been in the field
for, what, half an hour?

07:28.721 --> 07:31.214
We've got another five
before we need to check in,

07:31.334 --> 07:34.323
So the safest thing for us to do
is just...

07:34.697 --> 07:36.337
<i>sit tight and wait.</i>

07:36.983 --> 07:39.378
<i>When we don't check in,
they'll send a team.</i>

07:40.031 --> 07:41.506
Our radios should work down here?

07:41.709 --> 07:43.240
Yeah, they should.

07:43.534 --> 07:45.899
Okay, so, we...

07:47.388 --> 07:48.846
... we sit and wait.

07:51.371 --> 07:52.368
Okay.

08:00.060 --> 08:01.129
Anyone...

08:01.973 --> 08:03.424
bring any cards?

08:05.314 --> 08:06.023
No.

08:09.221 --> 08:10.034
Tremor!

08:28.691 --> 08:30.826
That sounded very, very bad.

08:33.311 --> 08:35.227
What do you suppose the probability is

08:35.347 --> 08:37.414
that this room is on
the same kind of metal stilts

08:37.534 --> 08:39.490
as those other rooms we saw over there?

08:40.035 --> 08:41.321
Very high.

08:41.756 --> 08:44.725
But this one's more stable, right?

08:44.845 --> 08:46.584
I mean, we're still standing.

08:46.704 --> 08:49.089
Yeah, but,
with the three of us and this dirt,

08:49.209 --> 08:51.801
we've just added, what, 300, 400 pounds?

08:53.269 --> 08:54.745
I'd say like 500.

08:55.060 --> 08:56.016
Right.

08:56.756 --> 08:59.250
And this region experiences
how many tremors a day?

08:59.411 --> 09:01.043
Four times a day, at least.

09:04.689 --> 09:06.841
What is it? What's wrong?

09:08.017 --> 09:10.900
The supports that are stopping this room
from dropping into the chasm

09:11.020 --> 09:13.764
are gonna rapidly destabilize now
that we've added all this extra weight.

09:15.802 --> 09:19.351
Don't think we'll be able to wait for
Atlantis to figure out we're missing.

09:19.471 --> 09:20.480
You're right.

09:21.095 --> 09:23.022
We're going to have
to find a way out of here.

09:27.491 --> 09:28.489
Well...

09:29.432 --> 09:30.566
There are a lot of...

09:30.686 --> 09:32.207
A lot of crates in here.

09:32.327 --> 09:33.576
<i>Yeah, rickety, old ones.</i>

09:33.737 --> 09:35.884
I killed, like, three
of them on the way down.

09:36.004 --> 09:37.811
But maybe we could
make, like, a pyramid,

09:37.931 --> 09:39.498
stack them up, climb out.

09:39.618 --> 09:42.328
- I don't think there's enough to...
- There are, actually.

09:42.448 --> 09:45.551
Just barely enough to get us high enough
but we should be able to make it work.

09:45.671 --> 09:47.488
You think it'll support our weight?

09:48.222 --> 09:49.928
There's only one way to find out.

10:11.808 --> 10:13.817
All right, look.

10:14.302 --> 10:16.075
If we're actually going to do this,

10:16.195 --> 10:18.410
I figure we need to stack these things,
like...

10:18.530 --> 10:20.432
20 feet high in order to climb out,

10:20.552 --> 10:22.100
so no matter how we build it,

10:22.220 --> 10:23.626
it's going to be unstable.

10:24.028 --> 10:26.789
Well, only one person has to climb it.

10:33.890 --> 10:36.419
Oh, no, I'm kind of awful

10:36.539 --> 10:38.742
with heights, so.

10:38.862 --> 10:40.425
<i>So, Sam goes.</i>

10:40.545 --> 10:42.436
What, you're not even gonna
consider yourself?

10:42.821 --> 10:44.730
It's heights,
I'm probably worse than she is.

10:46.850 --> 10:49.547
- Let's get started.
- All right, fine.

11:18.707 --> 11:19.593
Maybe...

11:19.713 --> 11:23.212
Maybe you should come down from there.
It sounds like it's...

11:39.885 --> 11:40.814
Sam!

11:44.730 --> 11:45.690
Easy, easy!

11:45.810 --> 11:46.991
You okay?

11:47.381 --> 11:48.862
Is she all right?

11:49.199 --> 11:50.551
That was fun.

11:50.671 --> 11:53.557
The bottom level won't hold. The crates
aren't strong enough to stack.

11:53.677 --> 11:55.051
Yeah, I got that, thanks.

11:55.806 --> 11:56.549
So?

12:06.251 --> 12:07.563
We need another plan.

12:08.164 --> 12:09.244
And quick.

12:21.369 --> 12:22.900
Hey, I got some files here.

12:24.194 --> 12:26.179
Can anyone... Read Genii?

12:26.299 --> 12:28.034
Hello, hello!

12:28.759 --> 12:30.721
<i>- What have you got?</i>
- Grappling hook.

12:30.841 --> 12:33.779
At least, something we can use
as a grappling hook.

12:33.899 --> 12:34.756
<i>Great.</i>

12:35.070 --> 12:36.412
Now all we need is some rope.

12:36.532 --> 12:38.052
Okay, just a sec... The ceiling is,

12:38.212 --> 12:40.474
- like, what, 20 feet?
- 25?

12:40.594 --> 12:44.578
All right, 25, so our jackets,
end-to-end are five or six feet,

12:44.797 --> 12:47.447
tie those to our shirts...
Maybe even our pants together.

12:47.567 --> 12:50.702
That should be able to get us up there
and support our weight.

12:51.823 --> 12:52.712
Great.

12:59.882 --> 13:01.030
Found rope!

13:02.765 --> 13:04.583
<i>Rope and lanterns.</i>

13:05.473 --> 13:07.754
- Oh, good.
- More than enough for what we need.

13:07.874 --> 13:08.666
Nice work.

13:09.159 --> 13:10.239
Thank you.

13:16.320 --> 13:17.402
What are you doing?

13:17.522 --> 13:20.302
I'm going to tie the rope on
and toss it up there so you climb up.

13:20.463 --> 13:21.620
I can't do it.

13:21.740 --> 13:23.880
- Quitter talk.
- No, I can't climb this.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.142
This rope, it's too thin.
We need to tie knots in it.

13:26.302 --> 13:29.353
- I need something to grip onto.
- Right. That's a lot of knots.

13:29.725 --> 13:32.279
Well, we only need about 30 feet or so.

13:32.642 --> 13:34.691
Okay, well,
you gals get started on the knotting,

13:34.852 --> 13:37.291
and I'll read those files.

13:39.021 --> 13:42.041
What? Look, they could contain
the code to the door there.

13:42.383 --> 13:44.918
Besides, three people can't knot
the same rope.

13:45.038 --> 13:47.104
Unless either of you speak Genii?

13:47.224 --> 13:49.220
Fine, we'll get started.

13:50.743 --> 13:53.085
Well, want to play 20 questions?

13:54.218 --> 13:55.901
I'll let you go first.

13:56.021 --> 13:57.566
Animal, vegetable or mineral?

13:57.686 --> 13:59.133
I'm good, thanks.

14:01.266 --> 14:03.482
Well, here's a better one we can play.

14:04.308 --> 14:06.090
Brad Pitt or George Clooney?

14:07.698 --> 14:09.176
If you had to choose?

14:11.198 --> 14:12.354
Clooney, I guess.

14:13.080 --> 14:15.209
Pitt all the way.
Okay, you go.

14:15.975 --> 14:17.868
Come on, it's easy.
Any two guys I would know.

14:17.988 --> 14:19.153
Okay, okay.

14:20.846 --> 14:23.532
Brian Greene or Neil Degrasse Tyson.

14:27.346 --> 14:28.496
They're physicists.

14:29.882 --> 14:32.082
They're on tv.
I picked ones you should know.

14:34.840 --> 14:36.003
Brian Greene, I guess.

14:36.955 --> 14:38.255
Tyson, all the way.

14:38.416 --> 14:40.272
Are you talking about
Neil Degrasse Tyson?

14:40.392 --> 14:42.647
He once stole an idea from me.
Did I tell you that story?

14:42.767 --> 14:44.982
Only about a dozen times, McKay.

14:45.917 --> 14:47.934
We're playing "who would you rather"?

14:48.157 --> 14:49.392
Want to join us?

14:50.169 --> 14:51.906
"Would you... "
sorry, I don't get it.

14:52.026 --> 14:52.895
<i>Well, if...</i>

14:53.055 --> 14:56.106
you had to choose who
to fool around with, would it be...

14:57.725 --> 14:59.318
Robert Redford or Paul Newman?

15:00.922 --> 15:01.946
Uh, neither?

15:02.590 --> 15:04.281
Yeah, I know, but if you had to.

15:05.239 --> 15:06.692
If I had to?
So I'm...

15:06.812 --> 15:09.081
to choose which of those guys
I would want to force

15:09.201 --> 15:11.747
- themselves on me because...
<i>- It's just a dumb game, McKay.</i>

15:11.907 --> 15:15.036
You're not secure enough in
your masculinity to play a dumb game?

15:15.156 --> 15:16.685
Yes, well, I think I am, I just...

15:16.805 --> 15:18.553
I should get back to my reading.
You know,

15:18.673 --> 15:20.651
the one thing
that could get us out of here.

15:22.956 --> 15:25.347
- Newman.
- Absolutely. Not even a question.

15:25.467 --> 15:27.680
- Shut up a sec.
- No, we're allowed to talk.

15:27.840 --> 15:29.651
No, no, no.
I hear something...

15:31.503 --> 15:33.497
There's someone up there.
Help!

15:34.351 --> 15:35.813
We're stuck down here!
Hello?

15:37.892 --> 15:39.483
What if the ceiling caves in on them?

15:39.643 --> 15:41.380
We came thru' that section.
Eaten by rust.

15:41.500 --> 15:43.392
- Rest of the ceiling looks fine.
- He's right.

15:43.512 --> 15:46.889
As long as they don't fall in the hole,
they should be able to get help. Hello!

15:47.009 --> 15:48.775
Help!
We're stuck down here!

15:48.895 --> 15:50.037
Can you hear us?

15:51.713 --> 15:52.413
Hello?

15:53.411 --> 15:54.646
Oh, thank God.

15:55.900 --> 15:57.585
- Who are you?
<i>- We're visitors.</i>

15:57.745 --> 16:00.629
We were on our way to speak
to the people of your settlement.

16:01.227 --> 16:02.923
You shouldn't be down there.

16:03.083 --> 16:04.925
Yeah, we know, we fell down
here by accident.

16:05.715 --> 16:06.922
You all okay?

16:07.254 --> 16:09.215
We're fine. We're
just stuck. We need some help.

16:09.335 --> 16:10.848
You shouldn't be down there.

16:11.008 --> 16:12.808
Yeah, thanks, kid. Like I said...

16:13.250 --> 16:14.594
Go tell your parents.

16:14.714 --> 16:17.104
Tell them where we are,
that we're stuck and we need help.

16:19.125 --> 16:20.941
I don't think we can do that.

16:21.101 --> 16:22.818
What? Why not?

16:23.681 --> 16:25.779
We're not really supposed
to play out here.

16:26.193 --> 16:27.481
<i>If our parents find out...</i>

16:27.601 --> 16:30.053
It's okay, I promise
you won't get into trouble.

16:30.173 --> 16:31.466
You don't know my father.

16:31.586 --> 16:32.853
He'll be very upset.

16:32.973 --> 16:34.787
I'll explain the situation to him.

16:34.948 --> 16:36.027
It'll be okay.

16:36.344 --> 16:37.186
Please?

16:37.962 --> 16:39.257
We're hurt.

16:39.377 --> 16:40.377
We need help.

16:40.967 --> 16:42.843
Wait a minute,
he said you were all okay.

16:42.963 --> 16:43.963
I asked him.

16:44.124 --> 16:46.193
All right,
listen to me, you little brats!

16:46.313 --> 16:48.135
<i>I am older than you and I am in charge.</i>

16:48.295 --> 16:50.226
- Rodney...
- You will go back to your parents,

16:50.346 --> 16:52.583
you will tell them we need help,
or so help me...

16:52.703 --> 16:54.001
Do you need something?

16:54.319 --> 16:56.035
<i>Anything. We can get it for you.</i>

16:56.155 --> 16:58.700
<i>If you help us,
we'll get you whatever you want.</i>

17:00.182 --> 17:01.947
- Oh, yes, good, great idea, yes.
- Thanks.

17:02.067 --> 17:03.549
Maybe you should show them your...

17:03.669 --> 17:05.655
- Excuse me?
- I was once a 10-year-old boy, too.

17:05.775 --> 17:07.726
- I know what gets their attention.
- McKay...

17:08.117 --> 17:09.913
What? Do want to get out
of here or not?

17:10.032 --> 17:13.198
I think we can reason with them
without resorting to that, thank you.

17:13.318 --> 17:14.717
If you say so.

17:20.452 --> 17:21.598
We gotta go now. Bye!

17:21.719 --> 17:22.419
<i>No!</i>

17:22.579 --> 17:23.795
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

17:25.311 --> 17:26.423
Good luck.

17:28.443 --> 17:30.774
- Would it have killed you to show...
- Drop it! McKay.

17:30.894 --> 17:32.446
It's not going to happen.

17:33.402 --> 17:35.078
Four hours and 50 minutes.

17:36.777 --> 17:39.447
I'm warning you...
I mean, I could go crazy down here.

17:39.567 --> 17:41.759
Ever since the whole Jumper
thing a couple of years ago,

17:41.879 --> 17:43.445
I've been very bad with tight spaces.

17:43.565 --> 17:45.114
Please. That's nothing. I was stuck

17:45.234 --> 17:47.600
in a transporter with Zelenka
for 3 hours. Now, that's hard.

17:47.720 --> 17:49.571
What are you saying,
you don't like Zelenka?

17:50.531 --> 17:51.533
No, I just...

17:52.882 --> 17:55.035
It was more claustrophobic than this.

17:55.195 --> 17:57.476
Yeah, but that's not what you said.
You emphasized "Zelenka."

17:57.596 --> 17:59.541
You said, "being stuck
with Zelenka for 3 hours,"

17:59.661 --> 18:01.164
like that was the hard part.

18:01.284 --> 18:02.918
It did kind of sound that way.

18:03.078 --> 18:03.789
Look...

18:03.909 --> 18:06.470
You can say you don't like him.
It's fine. I don't like him.

18:07.672 --> 18:09.948
Well, he's certainly a unique guy.

18:10.578 --> 18:12.965
He's always telling me
how nice my hair smells.

18:13.085 --> 18:14.179
It's a little weird.

18:14.339 --> 18:15.822
He's a very good person.

18:15.942 --> 18:18.225
Well, sure, sure, he's the best.
You just don't like him.

18:18.386 --> 18:20.164
- I did not say that.
- You didn't have to.

18:20.284 --> 18:22.604
- I know which one's your favorite now.
- It's not a contest.

18:22.724 --> 18:24.322
Everything is a contest.

18:25.017 --> 18:27.410
- Don't you have some reading to do?
- There's nothing in there.

18:27.530 --> 18:29.743
Certainly nothing about the door code.

18:30.349 --> 18:31.077
So?

18:32.179 --> 18:32.888
So?

18:34.016 --> 18:35.372
Back to knotting.

18:42.144 --> 18:43.414
Steve Carell

18:44.356 --> 18:45.932
or Stephen Colbert?

18:47.280 --> 18:48.586
Colbert, I think.

18:49.735 --> 18:52.713
Carell, but I would pick
John Stewart over both of them.

18:53.821 --> 18:55.233
If I was forced to.

18:58.117 --> 19:00.005
Are you and Katie still...

19:02.321 --> 19:03.854
Well, it's kind of messed up now.

19:04.541 --> 19:05.913
Why?
What happened?

19:07.272 --> 19:08.926
Well, I was going to propose.

19:09.600 --> 19:10.664
You were?

19:10.872 --> 19:12.664
Yeah, I bought her
a ring and everything.

19:12.784 --> 19:16.772
You know, was going to ask her,
and then the quarantine error happened.

19:18.241 --> 19:20.361
What does that have
to do with anything?

19:20.481 --> 19:22.756
Well, I don't particularly want
to go into the details but,

19:22.876 --> 19:25.238
you know, I just... I told her
that I needed some time for me.

19:25.358 --> 19:27.154
It had nothing
to do with her. I just...

19:27.274 --> 19:29.951
needed to figure some stuff out,
and now she doesn't want to speak to me.

19:30.071 --> 19:32.371
She's filed for
a transfer back to Earth.

19:32.728 --> 19:34.988
You broke up with her.
That's a break-up.

19:35.108 --> 19:36.616
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah, you did.

19:36.736 --> 19:38.305
No, I said I needed some time for me.

19:38.602 --> 19:41.183
Yeah, code for "I'm not that
into you anymore."

19:41.343 --> 19:43.060
- But I meant it!
<i>- It doesn't matter.</i>

19:43.220 --> 19:46.271
You can't "almost" propose to someone
and then take it back.

19:47.599 --> 19:49.406
<i>That's a relationship killer.</i>

19:51.587 --> 19:53.486
Oh, I suppose it was for the best.
I mean...

19:53.606 --> 19:55.974
she deserves to be with someone
who would've known that.

19:56.773 --> 19:59.576
What she deserves is to
be with a nice guy like you.

20:02.410 --> 20:04.343
- What?
- We're finished.

20:04.463 --> 20:05.665
Oh! Finally.

20:05.931 --> 20:06.783
Right.

20:18.534 --> 20:20.305
- You guys hear that?
- It's the kids!

20:20.465 --> 20:22.959
- They've come back for us.
- I knew they were good kids. I knew it.

20:23.103 --> 20:24.243
Down here!

20:24.494 --> 20:26.129
I knew you'd come back!

20:26.663 --> 20:27.437
Guys?

20:32.576 --> 20:34.319
See? I told you they were down there.

20:36.435 --> 20:38.866
Are your parents up there?
Did you bring help?

20:39.194 --> 20:41.451
No. Our friends didn't believe us.

20:41.611 --> 20:44.619
We bet them a week's supply of taffle
that we were telling the truth.

20:44.739 --> 20:46.456
See? I told you not to.

20:47.865 --> 20:49.251
Where are the adults?

20:49.412 --> 20:51.378
We can't tell them.
We'll get in trouble.

20:51.538 --> 20:53.380
Trouble? Now, you wait till

20:53.540 --> 20:56.242
<i>I get out of here, you little brats!
I'll show you what trouble is!</i>

20:56.362 --> 20:57.358
Tremor!

20:57.717 --> 20:58.932
We're moving!

21:04.551 --> 21:06.134
Tilting over!

21:11.296 --> 21:12.296
It stopped.

21:13.795 --> 21:16.904
The superstructure under this room
must have buckled.

21:18.919 --> 21:20.234
One more tremor,

21:20.354 --> 21:23.132
this whole chamber's
going to fall into the chasm.

21:32.958 --> 21:35.556
- Do you want me to do that?
- No. I can do it.

21:37.221 --> 21:38.687
Well, it's just...

21:39.388 --> 21:41.222
Have you ever done
anything like this before?

21:41.342 --> 21:42.346
What, you have?

21:42.466 --> 21:44.556
Yes, actually,
I have a bunch of times.

21:44.716 --> 21:46.846
Yeah? Well, I mean, so have I.

21:47.177 --> 21:49.045
You know, missions and such.

21:49.912 --> 21:52.158
- Okay.
- You should probably...

21:52.778 --> 21:53.800
Oh, right.

21:58.600 --> 21:59.655
All right.

22:07.280 --> 22:08.293
Sorry. Sorry.

22:08.413 --> 22:10.247
You just about took my head off.

22:10.367 --> 22:12.417
Yeah, but I didn't mean to.
It slipped.

22:12.577 --> 22:13.794
Let me do it.

22:14.534 --> 22:15.545
I can do it.

22:15.705 --> 22:17.439
- Apparently, you can't.
- I can do it,

22:17.559 --> 22:19.466
just don't stand in front of me.

22:21.152 --> 22:22.344
Or behind me.

22:25.217 --> 22:26.217
Okay.

22:38.896 --> 22:39.945
See? Almost there.

22:43.441 --> 22:45.200
- All right.
- You'll get it.

22:47.277 --> 22:48.499
<i>You can do this.</i>

22:50.607 --> 22:51.873
This is the one.

22:52.242 --> 22:54.147
<i>I can feel it, this is the one.</i>

23:05.965 --> 23:08.240
- What are you doing?
- Stay there!

23:26.674 --> 23:27.841
Anything hurt?

23:27.967 --> 23:29.489
No, just my pride.

23:31.153 --> 23:32.409
That'll heal.

23:39.449 --> 23:40.527
You did it.

23:41.509 --> 23:42.353
Great.

23:47.877 --> 23:49.833
All right, here goes nothing.

23:58.214 --> 23:59.025
Nuts.

24:19.989 --> 24:22.700
<i>There's no way the hook
can grab onto that soil.</i>

24:23.591 --> 24:25.024
All those knots...

24:25.710 --> 24:27.123
Well, we had to try.

24:28.546 --> 24:29.924
Any other ideas?

24:32.525 --> 24:33.841
See those beams up there?

24:33.961 --> 24:36.394
We use the rope to get up there.
That buys us at least 10 feet.

24:36.514 --> 24:40.387
Then we build a bridge,
a bridge using... Using these.

24:44.201 --> 24:46.630
Stack a couple of crates, we're golden.
We got that high before.

24:46.750 --> 24:49.195
Yeah, but I don't think these are
long enough to span the distance

24:49.315 --> 24:52.323
- between those two beams.
- So we find a hammer and nails.

24:52.443 --> 24:54.955
Sure, why not just add a jetpack
and a trampoline to that list.

24:55.115 --> 24:57.082
It is possible to find
a hammer and nails.

24:57.242 --> 24:59.252
We've been over the room
pretty thoroughly.

24:59.372 --> 25:01.086
But there's got to be
a hammer and nails.

25:01.246 --> 25:04.506
- Well, even if we found them...
- Look, we just have to build a bridge.

25:06.934 --> 25:08.343
Wait a second, wait a second.

25:09.903 --> 25:11.263
That bar bet.

25:11.818 --> 25:12.651
Sorry?

25:12.771 --> 25:15.100
That dumb trick you do
to get free beer.

25:17.450 --> 25:19.786
We don't know
what you're talking about.

25:19.906 --> 25:21.025
<i>Bet goes like this...</i>

25:21.765 --> 25:23.476
Using these three knives,

25:23.803 --> 25:25.570
and without moving these three cups,

25:25.690 --> 25:29.175
you need to build a bridge
that can support another cup's weight.

25:31.400 --> 25:34.201
- We don't have another cup.
- Whatever. We'll use these.

25:35.780 --> 25:36.589
Now...

25:37.360 --> 25:38.216
See?

25:38.491 --> 25:40.007
Just like our boards...

25:41.025 --> 25:43.295
just a little too short
to span the space

25:43.455 --> 25:45.206
between the two beams there.

25:47.509 --> 25:50.635
You know what? We're geniuses, we could
probably figure it out, but, a little

25:50.795 --> 25:53.236
<i>- under the gun, so.</i>
- Okay.

26:19.947 --> 26:21.541
You owe me a beer, by the way.

26:22.026 --> 26:23.310
Hey, this works,

26:23.430 --> 26:24.544
I'll buy you a keg.

28:09.098 --> 28:11.620
I knew this wasn't such a good idea.

28:12.636 --> 28:13.467
<i>Listen,</i>

28:13.646 --> 28:15.383
I have a reputation
for being pessimistic,

28:15.503 --> 28:17.907
but I think you should come down
before it all collapses.

28:20.625 --> 28:21.328
<i>Sam.</i>

28:21.488 --> 28:22.912
Sam, just head back.

28:23.481 --> 28:24.985
I'm almost there.

28:27.476 --> 28:28.251
<i>Oh, no!</i>

28:31.331 --> 28:32.082
Sam!

28:33.367 --> 28:34.802
Don't move. Don't move!

28:40.023 --> 28:41.144
Let me see.

28:47.977 --> 28:49.314
Your leg is broken.

28:51.462 --> 28:52.942
We're in trouble now, aren't we?

28:53.102 --> 28:55.026
No, we'll be fine. We just...

28:55.772 --> 28:56.948
We'll be fine.

29:09.202 --> 29:10.498
Can you help me?

29:11.250 --> 29:13.546
One hand here, on her knee.

29:15.274 --> 29:17.008
One hand down here, on her ankle.

29:17.168 --> 29:18.612
Keep it nice and straight.

29:18.773 --> 29:21.346
You're not going to like this,
but I got to take your boot off.

29:21.506 --> 29:22.806
I thought you might.

29:32.121 --> 29:33.282
Here it comes.

29:42.894 --> 29:45.245
Tell me when you can feel
my finger on the bottom of your foot.

29:45.873 --> 29:46.871
Okay.

29:50.118 --> 29:51.061
Yep.

29:51.594 --> 29:52.544
Yeah.

29:53.579 --> 29:55.213
- Here?
- Yeah.

30:01.421 --> 30:03.648
We need to find another one of these,
make a splint.

30:03.809 --> 30:04.764
Okay.

30:10.616 --> 30:11.545
Look.

30:12.926 --> 30:14.265
How bad is she?

30:15.008 --> 30:15.775
Well...

30:15.935 --> 30:17.259
It's not so bad.

30:17.602 --> 30:19.367
She still has feeling in her foot,

30:19.487 --> 30:21.703
so there doesn't seem
to be any nerve damage, but...

30:21.823 --> 30:23.378
the break's pretty severe,

30:23.739 --> 30:26.327
which means there may very well
be internal bleeding.

30:26.487 --> 30:29.247
Yeah, but that's...
I mean, that's... bad, isn't it?

30:29.407 --> 30:31.420
Well, it's not really good, no.

30:31.986 --> 30:34.501
- I'd need to get her under a scanner.
- Okay, worst-case scenario,

30:34.621 --> 30:37.302
she's bleeding internally.
How long has she got before she...

30:37.617 --> 30:39.424
Before it becomes very serious?

30:40.664 --> 30:41.426
An hour.

30:41.946 --> 30:43.178
- Oh, boy.
- Come on.

30:48.868 --> 30:49.920
So, what?

30:50.803 --> 30:53.173
<i>Hour before internal bleeding
becomes a problem?</i>

30:53.542 --> 30:56.245
- How did you...
- <i>It's not my first rodeo, Rodney.</i>

30:57.435 --> 30:59.505
- Here's some Ibuprofen.
- Ibuprofen?

30:59.625 --> 31:02.795
- That's the strongest thing you've got?
- It's all I found in this basic kit.

31:03.199 --> 31:06.791
Although, from this point on,
I think I'm making morphine mandatory.

31:07.571 --> 31:09.729
As well as maybe a grappling gun.

31:11.115 --> 31:12.954
<i>I wouldn't take the morphine.</i>

31:13.262 --> 31:15.043
<i>Gotta keep a clear head.</i>

31:15.203 --> 31:17.390
We still have to figure out
a way out of here.

31:17.510 --> 31:19.297
At least, one of us does.

31:19.457 --> 31:21.824
Chances are pretty slim
that I'm gonna climb out.

31:22.275 --> 31:23.936
Yeah, well, the crates are out.

31:24.106 --> 31:25.009
Yep.

31:25.885 --> 31:28.942
- If you got an idea, feel free.
- I came up with the bar trick thing,

31:29.062 --> 31:32.015
and that didn't work out so well,
so I think I'll just...

31:32.329 --> 31:33.561
leave it to the pros.

31:34.137 --> 31:35.137
Yeah.

31:36.840 --> 31:37.881
Sorry.

31:38.001 --> 31:40.151
All my energy's focused on
not screaming in agony.

31:41.052 --> 31:41.903
Wonderful.

31:44.936 --> 31:46.921
The grappling hook didn't work because

31:47.041 --> 31:49.069
the hook wouldn't hold
our weight in the soil.

31:49.189 --> 31:51.120
The crates didn't work
because Sam was too heavy.

31:53.472 --> 31:56.238
We all would have been.
I mean, our weight in general.

31:56.615 --> 31:59.921
It had nothing to do with you.
I mean, you're in very good shape.

32:00.301 --> 32:02.549
Seriously.
You have, like, the perfect body.

32:04.989 --> 32:06.478
Oh, not that you don't.

32:06.698 --> 32:09.389
No, no. I realize
that your bodies are different,

32:10.045 --> 32:12.167
and maybe that would mean

32:12.287 --> 32:14.602
that I think your body is imperfect,
but that's not the case.

32:15.241 --> 32:18.022
No. No, no.
Far, far, far from it. That...

32:18.493 --> 32:20.071
That is a sweet...

32:21.341 --> 32:24.377
Which is to say, it would be impossible
for me to choose which of you...

32:24.497 --> 32:26.795
Rest assured,
you're never gonna have to.

32:27.082 --> 32:30.076
If we'd kept quiet, I bet he would have
gone on like that forever.

32:30.236 --> 32:31.096
I'm sorry.

32:31.216 --> 32:33.997
- What I mean is that you have...
- Rodney.

32:34.614 --> 32:35.915
Stay on topic.

32:36.075 --> 32:37.676
Right. Okay...

32:38.264 --> 32:39.603
Right, where was I?

32:39.945 --> 32:40.915
All right,

32:41.139 --> 32:42.036
look...

32:42.870 --> 32:44.465
If we can get...

32:44.716 --> 32:45.955
this rod up there,

32:46.160 --> 32:49.043
attach the rope to it, it'll lay
across the hole, support our weight.

32:49.213 --> 32:51.180
We won't have to worry about the soil.

32:51.340 --> 32:53.975
You were barely able to get
the grappling hook up there.

32:54.442 --> 32:56.728
Barely?
Were you not watching?

32:56.888 --> 32:58.932
It's just that
it's a lot heavier than that.

32:59.164 --> 33:00.149
So...

33:03.893 --> 33:05.219
A detonator...

33:06.272 --> 33:07.666
I need a detonator.

33:09.675 --> 33:12.545
Just place the detonator
inside of the tube...

33:19.979 --> 33:20.908
Now.

33:25.870 --> 33:28.604
We have to seal the bottom of the tube

33:28.973 --> 33:30.476
around the gas leak,

33:30.917 --> 33:31.984
like so.

33:35.646 --> 33:36.835
All right.

33:38.024 --> 33:38.926
So...

33:39.257 --> 33:40.552
put the wadding...

33:41.507 --> 33:44.051
and the rod into the barrel...

33:45.282 --> 33:47.277
and then, gently, create a seal.

33:47.550 --> 33:50.519
We don't want to pack it too tight,
or we've got ourselves a pipe bomb,

33:50.639 --> 33:52.116
but, if we play it right,

33:52.873 --> 33:55.387
- our very own cannon.
- You really think this is gonna work?

33:55.507 --> 33:56.507
It should.

34:00.308 --> 34:02.085
You can build a cannon just like that?

34:02.651 --> 34:04.841
Please, we got access
to pressurized gas, it's a cinch.

34:04.961 --> 34:07.877
- You should have seen my grade six...
- Rodney.

34:08.626 --> 34:09.944
Right. Okay, yeah.

34:10.947 --> 34:12.158
All right, so.

34:17.475 --> 34:18.510
Ready?

34:35.063 --> 34:36.703
All right. Okay.

34:37.536 --> 34:39.424
<i>And... are we ready?</i>

34:41.135 --> 34:42.041
Ready.

34:43.851 --> 34:45.342
Fire in the hole.

34:52.474 --> 34:53.636
Nice aim!

34:54.261 --> 34:55.563
Nice cannon.

35:00.729 --> 35:02.301
That went really far.

35:22.331 --> 35:23.127
<i>McKay!</i>

35:23.952 --> 35:26.575
You should stop.
There's too much dirt coming in.

35:26.695 --> 35:29.326
- The room's gonna get too heavy.
<i>- I've almost got it!</i>

35:48.935 --> 35:50.013
<i>Jennifer!</i>

35:51.607 --> 35:52.571
Down here!

35:53.105 --> 35:54.573
<i>Rodney, don't let go!</i>

36:06.797 --> 36:08.533
Rodney, don't let go!

36:09.180 --> 36:11.078
- Rodney?
- Sam, I can't hold it.

36:11.198 --> 36:12.277
<i>Yes, you can!</i>

36:12.620 --> 36:14.874
No, I've never been good
at holding heavy things.

36:14.994 --> 36:17.146
I had an old lady's grocery cart
in college...

36:17.266 --> 36:18.865
One reason I didn't date....

36:18.985 --> 36:21.318
Stay focused!
You need to pull her up.

36:21.571 --> 36:24.794
Really? I was just getting used
to the idea of not letting go.

36:24.914 --> 36:26.813
She can't just hang there
forever, Rodney.

36:26.973 --> 36:28.813
- Help me!
- Rodney, I can't help you.

36:28.975 --> 36:32.307
I can't even stand up. You're gonna have
to pull her up on your own.

36:41.832 --> 36:42.745
<i>Wait, wait!</i>

36:42.905 --> 36:44.470
- Don't pull me up!
- <i>What?</i>

36:45.062 --> 36:45.873
Why?

36:47.572 --> 36:48.788
<i>I see light!</i>

36:49.161 --> 36:52.117
No, no! Don't go towards the light.
You wanna stay with the living.

36:52.404 --> 36:55.659
No, daylight.
There's a mineshaft down here.

36:55.779 --> 36:57.176
I see daylight!

36:57.296 --> 36:59.343
Like on the other side.
Should have thought of that!

36:59.463 --> 37:01.871
Okay, guys, what do you
want me to do? What do I do?

37:01.991 --> 37:02.872
<i>Lower me.</i>

37:03.435 --> 37:04.600
What? Lower you?

37:04.760 --> 37:07.228
It's about 10 feet away.
I just need to swing over.

37:08.097 --> 37:10.983
What if the mineshaft is harder
to get out of than this chamber?

37:11.103 --> 37:13.526
We already lost our exit, Rodney.

37:14.207 --> 37:16.898
<i>I'll take my chances!
Just lower me, I can't hold on forever.</i>

37:17.349 --> 37:18.489
You and me both.

37:26.939 --> 37:28.165
Okay, good, stop.

37:28.524 --> 37:29.536
Gladly.

37:40.687 --> 37:43.079
You're doing great, Rodney!
You're doing just great.

37:43.199 --> 37:45.849
No, "great" is the beach
with a fiber-optic hook-up.

37:45.969 --> 37:47.954
This, this is complete agony!

38:00.397 --> 38:01.372
<i>I made it!</i>

38:03.372 --> 38:05.190
You could have warned me.

38:08.675 --> 38:10.291
This thing leads straight out.

38:10.747 --> 38:12.351
<i>It's a nice, steady slope!</i>

38:12.687 --> 38:15.129
- <i>Come on, you guys gotta get down here!</i>
- You go.

38:16.535 --> 38:18.134
What? No way.

38:19.686 --> 38:21.711
There's no way I'm going to be able
to lower myself.

38:21.831 --> 38:23.512
You won't have to. I'll lower you.

38:24.059 --> 38:26.015
Rodney, your hands...

38:31.565 --> 38:33.163
Look, I'm not leaving you behind.

38:33.283 --> 38:35.142
Come on... Make you a seat.

38:56.396 --> 38:57.831
Okay, that's good.
Stop!

38:58.938 --> 39:00.004
Stopping!

39:09.176 --> 39:10.475
Almost there!

39:11.308 --> 39:13.686
Just give me a few more feet of slack!

39:24.520 --> 39:25.366
I got her!

39:31.565 --> 39:33.509
- You're up, McKay!
- Oh! Great.

39:33.714 --> 39:35.738
Great, because, I was just thinking

39:35.858 --> 39:37.383
what would be awesome?

39:37.503 --> 39:39.548
Would be more physical exertion.

39:42.459 --> 39:44.441
Come on now, start swinging.

39:46.755 --> 39:48.572
Rodney, you have to use your body

39:48.692 --> 39:51.256
and start swinging.
Come on, you're so close.

39:51.652 --> 39:52.451
No.

39:52.951 --> 39:54.812
Used everything I got to get this far.

39:55.878 --> 39:59.178
So that's it then, you're quitting?
You're just gonna die there on the rope?

39:59.754 --> 40:00.553
No.

40:01.190 --> 40:03.103
No, I'm just taking a little rest.

40:04.940 --> 40:06.957
<i>You know, I'm like...</i>

40:07.257 --> 40:09.535
<i>Like a real-life action star, kinda.</i>

40:09.867 --> 40:11.576
- What?
- <i>You know,</i>

40:12.281 --> 40:14.569
shooting guns, running around,

40:15.198 --> 40:16.605
saving people...

40:17.958 --> 40:20.653
You'd think this
would be easy for me now.

40:20.773 --> 40:23.178
You think I'd be,
like, super-buff by now.

40:23.424 --> 40:25.974
Okay, come on, Schwarzenegger,
start swinging.

40:26.549 --> 40:27.956
Just a second more.

40:31.069 --> 40:32.768
Okay, break's over.

41:01.621 --> 41:03.001
That was close.

41:14.381 --> 41:15.588
Correction...

41:16.250 --> 41:17.502
That was close.

41:18.595 --> 41:21.257
Okay, come on.
You need to help me.

41:29.134 --> 41:31.073
Looks good.
Okay, thank you.

41:31.845 --> 41:32.883
How's Sam?

41:33.003 --> 41:34.439
She's gonna be okay.

41:34.559 --> 41:37.575
It's a clean break, they're resetting it
and putting her into a cast,

41:37.695 --> 41:41.020
which means she's gonna be on crutches
for a few weeks or so, but...

41:41.140 --> 41:42.069
Thank you...

41:42.445 --> 41:43.728
She's gonna be fine.

41:46.230 --> 41:47.449
How are you doing?

41:47.569 --> 41:50.071
I'd like to take a bath in this
ointment they just put on my hands,

41:50.191 --> 41:52.778
'cause they are the only thing
that doesn't hurt.

41:53.214 --> 41:54.823
It's not gonna scar, is it?

41:55.251 --> 41:56.358
Chicks dig scars.

41:56.549 --> 41:59.228
- Not the chicks I dig.
- You're gonna be fine.

42:02.635 --> 42:04.059
Thanks, by the way.

42:04.360 --> 42:05.276
For what?

42:05.698 --> 42:07.148
You saved my life.

42:07.636 --> 42:09.239
If you had let go...

42:09.457 --> 42:10.572
You're welcome.

42:12.197 --> 42:13.885
Right, I'm going back to my room,

42:14.005 --> 42:16.301
curling up in the fetal position,
sleeping for three days.

42:16.421 --> 42:17.663
Well, not quite yet.

42:19.333 --> 42:20.748
You owe me a beer

42:20.910 --> 42:22.960
from the bar trick thing earlier.

42:23.120 --> 42:24.693
You couldn't figure it out, so...

42:24.813 --> 42:26.839
There was no time!
I would've figured it out.

42:26.999 --> 42:29.081
Yeah, Chimps would have
been able to figure it out,

42:29.201 --> 42:30.801
but the thing is, you didn't,

42:30.961 --> 42:33.564
so I win, and you owe me a beer.

42:33.684 --> 42:35.628
I don't remember
ever agreeing to the beer.

42:35.748 --> 42:36.950
- McKay.
- What?

42:37.565 --> 42:39.477
Do you wanna have
a drink with me, or not?

42:42.075 --> 42:43.715
You wanna have a drink?

42:45.914 --> 42:47.860
God, you're not very good
at this, are you?

42:48.374 --> 42:49.904
No. No, I'm not.

42:51.263 --> 42:52.447
Come on.
