04:06.970 --> 04:08.420
EDMURE: If I may, nephew,

04:08.480 --> 04:11.080
I encountered a situation
with one of my lieutenants

04:11.150 --> 04:13.320
at the Stone Mill which
may have some bearing...

04:13.410 --> 04:16.790
Why don't you shut your mouth
about that damned mill?

04:16.850 --> 04:19.519
And don't call him
"nephew." He is your king.

04:19.620 --> 04:21.029
Robb knows I meant him no...

04:21.120 --> 04:24.660
You're lucky I'm not your king.

04:24.760 --> 04:28.260
I wouldn't let you wave your blunders
around like a victory ï¬‚ag.

04:28.330 --> 04:31.040
My blunder sent Tywin's mad dog

04:31.130 --> 04:33.980
back to Casterly Rock
with his tail between his legs.

04:34.030 --> 04:36.340
I think King Robb understands
we won't win this war

04:36.440 --> 04:38.080
if he's the only one winning any battles.

04:38.110 --> 04:39.450
No, there's glory enough to go around.

04:39.510 --> 04:41.350
It's not about glory.

04:43.180 --> 04:45.850
Your instructions were to
wait for him to come to you.

04:45.950 --> 04:47.190
I seized an opportunity.

04:47.310 --> 04:48.620
What value was the mill?

04:49.450 --> 04:51.450
The Mountain was garrisoned
across the river from it.

04:51.520 --> 04:52.960
ROBB: Is he there now?

04:53.020 --> 04:56.470
Of course not. We took the fight to
him. He could not withstand us.

04:56.520 --> 04:59.730
I wanted to draw the
Mountain into the west,

04:59.830 --> 05:03.830
into our country,
where we could surround him and kill him.

05:03.900 --> 05:06.140
I wanted him to chase us,

05:06.200 --> 05:09.480
which he would have done
because he is a mad dog

05:09.540 --> 05:11.640
without a strategic thought in his head.

05:11.710 --> 05:14.740
I could have that head on a spike by now.

05:17.240 --> 05:19.660
Instead, I have a mill.

05:22.550 --> 05:27.730
We took hostages.
Willem Lannister. Martyn Lannister.

05:27.820 --> 05:30.270
Willem and Martyn Lannister
are 14 years old.

05:30.360 --> 05:32.770
Martyn is 15, I believe.

05:36.200 --> 05:38.610
Tywin Lannister has my sisters.

05:40.270 --> 05:42.210
Have I sued for peace?

05:42.270 --> 05:43.680
No.

05:43.740 --> 05:48.240
Do you think he'll
sue for peace because we have his father's

05:48.340 --> 05:51.190
brother's great-grandsons?

05:55.950 --> 05:57.390
No.

05:57.450 --> 05:59.360
How many men did you lose?

06:00.950 --> 06:04.560
208. But for every man we
lost, the Lannisters...

06:04.630 --> 06:07.440
We need our men more than Tywin needs his!

06:13.730 --> 06:15.740
I'm sorry.

06:15.800 --> 06:16.800
I didn't know.

06:16.940 --> 06:17.940
You would have.

06:18.040 --> 06:21.420
Right here today
at this gathering, if you had been patient.

06:21.480 --> 06:24.580
We seem to be running
short of patience here.

06:24.650 --> 06:27.060
You know who isn't?

06:28.720 --> 06:30.590
Tywin Lannister.

08:27.830 --> 08:30.610
Conveniently close
to your own quarters. I like it.

08:32.210 --> 08:33.780
What news of Jaime?

08:38.280 --> 08:42.190
20,000 unwashed Northerners
have known about his escape for weeks.

08:42.350 --> 08:44.420
You control more spies and informants

08:44.550 --> 08:46.620
than the rest of the world combined.

08:46.720 --> 08:50.690
Do you mean to tell me that none of you
has any notion of where he is?

08:50.760 --> 08:52.100
We are trying, my lord.

08:52.230 --> 08:53.570
Try harder.

08:56.030 --> 08:57.770
What do we have, then?

08:57.860 --> 09:00.900
Robb Stark and
most of his bannermen are in Riverrun

09:00.970 --> 09:04.740
for the funeral
of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully.

09:04.810 --> 09:09.780
In Stark's absence,
Rouse Bolton holds Harrenhal,

09:09.880 --> 09:13.320
which would seem
to make him Lord of Harrenhal,

09:13.410 --> 09:14.410
in practice, not in name.

09:14.550 --> 09:15.580
TYWIN: Let him have it.

09:15.650 --> 09:20.390
The name suits our purposes
far more than that useless pile of rubble.

09:20.450 --> 09:21.930
The Lord of Harrenhal will make

09:22.060 --> 09:23.500
a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn.

09:23.590 --> 09:26.660
For which I am
extremely grateful to you, my lord.

09:26.760 --> 09:29.200
Lady Arryn and I have known each
other since we were children.

09:29.230 --> 09:34.240
She has always been
positively predisposed toward me.

09:34.300 --> 09:36.840
A successful courtship would make

09:36.970 --> 09:39.470
Lord Baelish acting Lord of the Vale.

09:39.570 --> 09:42.350
Titles do seem to breed titles.

09:42.440 --> 09:44.320
You'll leave for the Eyrie
as soon as possible

09:44.440 --> 09:46.320
and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold.

09:46.410 --> 09:48.480
Then the young wolf can add his own aunt

09:48.580 --> 09:51.290
to the list of people who have
taken up arms against him.

09:51.350 --> 09:54.330
Far be it from me to hinder true love,

09:54.420 --> 09:58.630
but Lord Baelish's
absence would present certain problems.

09:58.690 --> 10:01.100
The royal wedding may end up being

10:01.260 --> 10:03.670
the most expensive event in living memory.

10:03.760 --> 10:06.640
Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead.

10:06.700 --> 10:10.480
Not a good time
to leave the crown's finances unattended.

10:10.540 --> 10:12.610
TYWIN: Fully agreed.

10:12.670 --> 10:15.810
Which is why I'm naming you
new Master of Coin.

10:15.880 --> 10:17.880
- (SCOFFS) Master of Coin?

10:17.980 --> 10:20.550
It would appear to best suits your talents.

10:20.650 --> 10:22.350
I'm quite good at spending money,

10:22.450 --> 10:24.290
but a lifetime of outrageous wealth

10:24.450 --> 10:26.290
hasn't taught me much about managing it.

10:26.350 --> 10:29.860
I have no doubt
you will prove equal to this challenge.

10:29.960 --> 10:31.730
Hear, hear.

10:32.960 --> 10:34.870
MAN: He lifted her high in the air

10:34.960 --> 10:37.170
He sniffed and roared and smelled her there

10:37.230 --> 10:39.400
She kicked and wailed, the maid so fair

10:39.500 --> 10:41.980
But he licked the honey from her hair

10:42.670 --> 10:45.050
ALL: From there to here, from here to there

10:45.140 --> 10:47.240
All black and brown and covered with hair

10:47.340 --> 10:49.410
He smelled that girl on the summer air

10:49.510 --> 10:52.010
The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair

10:53.480 --> 10:57.550
I hope you're pleased. If I were
armed, they'd never have taken us.

10:57.650 --> 10:59.650
BRIENNE: You were armed
when we were taken.

10:59.720 --> 11:01.600
I was in chains, if you recall.

11:01.690 --> 11:05.500
Our little match would have ended quite
quick if my hands weren't bound.

11:05.560 --> 11:08.770
All my life I've been
hearing, "Jaime Lannister,

11:08.860 --> 11:10.570
"what a brilliant swordsman."

11:11.530 --> 11:15.570
You were slower
than I expected. And more predictable.

11:15.670 --> 11:17.340
I've been sitting in a muddy pen,

11:17.440 --> 11:19.080
wrapped in chains, for the past year.

11:19.170 --> 11:21.080
I'm a woman. I was beating you.

11:21.170 --> 11:23.420
You were not beating me.

11:23.510 --> 11:25.680
Maybe you were as good as people said...

11:25.750 --> 11:27.690
Once.

11:27.750 --> 11:30.850
Or maybe people just
love to over-praise a famous name.

11:35.020 --> 11:39.090
When we make camp tonight,
you'll be raped. More than once.

11:39.190 --> 11:42.070
None of these fellows
have ever been with a noblewoman.

11:44.300 --> 11:46.610
- You'd be wise not to resist.
- Would I?

11:46.700 --> 11:48.040
They'll knock your teeth out.

11:48.200 --> 11:49.540
You think I care?

11:49.600 --> 11:51.950
No, I don't think you
care about your teeth.

11:55.810 --> 11:59.620
If you fight them,
they will kill you' Do you understand?

11:59.710 --> 12:02.280
I'm the prisoner of value, not you.

12:02.380 --> 12:04.790
Let them have
what they want. What does it matter?

12:04.880 --> 12:05.920
What does it matter?

12:05.990 --> 12:06.990
Close your eyes.

12:07.090 --> 12:08.660
Pretend they're Renly.

12:10.720 --> 12:12.930
If you were a woman, you wouldn't resist?

12:13.060 --> 12:15.300
You'd let them do what they wanted?

12:15.400 --> 12:20.640
If I was a woman, I'd make them kill
me. But I'm not, thank the Gods.

12:25.240 --> 12:27.410
If I had a proper forge,
I'd make it good as new.

12:27.470 --> 12:31.820
Doesn't have to look pretty. It just has
to keep the arrows out of my heart.

12:31.910 --> 12:33.820
Why are you helping him?

12:33.910 --> 12:35.980
He takes us prisoner, now he's our friend?

12:36.080 --> 12:37.650
THOROS: You're not our prisoner.

12:37.750 --> 12:38.860
What am I?

12:38.950 --> 12:39.990
Our guest.

12:40.090 --> 12:42.030
No one's put any chains on you.

12:42.120 --> 12:43.600
So I can walk away, then?

12:43.660 --> 12:46.470
These woods aren't safe
for Ned Stark's daughter.

12:46.530 --> 12:48.800
You're lucky we found you.

12:52.500 --> 12:56.140
HOUND: You think
you're good with that bow, you little twat?

12:56.200 --> 12:57.680
ANGUY: Better than anyone you've met.

12:58.100 --> 13:02.020
HOUND: A cowards weapon.
I like to fight up close,

13:02.110 --> 13:05.520
I like to see a man's face
when I put the steel in him.

13:05.610 --> 13:08.150
Why? So you can kiss him?

13:08.210 --> 13:10.060
You remember the last time you were here?

13:11.520 --> 13:13.690
Looks like every other
shit inn on the road.

13:13.790 --> 13:16.230
ANGUY: Now, apologies,
but you're one ugly fucker

13:16.320 --> 13:18.500
and I'd rather not see you no more.

13:20.990 --> 13:22.300

13:23.060 --> 13:25.040

(HORSE NEIGHING)

13:33.670 --> 13:35.880
What are you doing? We're about to leave.

13:35.980 --> 13:37.320
I'm staying.

13:39.580 --> 13:40.890
You're what?

13:42.080 --> 13:45.500
I baked brown bread for the innkeep,
she said she never had better.

13:46.150 --> 13:49.530
Told Thoros she's keeping me as
payment for all his free meals.

13:49.590 --> 13:54.100
Anyway, it's not me the Brotherhood
wants. My brother ain't no king.

13:54.190 --> 13:55.870
I'm not a Stark of Winterhell.

13:55.930 --> 13:57.200
Winterfell.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.570
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

14:03.170 --> 14:05.950
Well, I made you something.

14:10.510 --> 14:11.550
What is it?

14:12.350 --> 14:13.950
It's a wolf.

14:18.750 --> 14:20.360
Yes, it is.

14:21.760 --> 14:23.200
ARYA: That's the tail?

14:23.260 --> 14:24.630
Yeah.

14:26.290 --> 14:29.030
Well, be safe.

14:29.100 --> 14:32.700
Yeah, you, too. Don't get stabbed.

14:33.870 --> 14:37.410
You don't burn your fingers.

14:47.650 --> 14:48.890
Good-bye, Hot Pie.

14:50.480 --> 14:51.890
Good-bye, Arry.

15:03.230 --> 15:05.180
Up you go, little lady.

15:11.970 --> 15:13.420
ARYA: Hey, Hot Pie.

15:16.310 --> 15:18.080
It's really good.

15:24.080 --> 15:29.090
CATELYN: A person could almost be forgiven
for forgetting we're at war.

15:31.520 --> 15:36.030
It often comforts me
to think that even in war's darkest days,

15:36.130 --> 15:41.480
in most places in
the world absolutely nothing is happening.

15:44.600 --> 15:46.520
I've missed you, Uncle.

15:46.610 --> 15:50.350
Father missed you, too,
from the day you left.

15:50.440 --> 15:52.650
Maybe he never said it in so many words...

15:52.710 --> 15:54.320
Maybe?

15:54.380 --> 15:56.690
Your father was a stubborn old ox.

15:56.780 --> 16:01.130
I was surprised when he died. Didn't
think death had the patience.

16:03.460 --> 16:07.800
I'm glad you were
with him. I wish to the Gods I had been.

16:10.630 --> 16:13.470
Did you make peace in the end?

16:13.530 --> 16:18.810
After 30 years of fighting, I don't
think he remembered what started it.

16:18.870 --> 16:22.510
He asked me to stop
calling myself Blackfish.

16:22.580 --> 16:27.050
He said it was an old joke
and it was never funny to begin with.

16:28.380 --> 16:31.730
I told him people
had been calling me Blackfish for so long,

16:31.820 --> 16:33.990
they don't remember my real name.

16:38.260 --> 16:42.000
Every time he would leave for the
capital or fight in a campaign,

16:43.200 --> 16:45.230
I'd see him off.

16:45.330 --> 16:48.400
"Wait for me, little Cat," he'd say.

16:49.770 --> 16:54.220
"Wait for me, and I'll come back to you."

16:55.940 --> 17:00.450
And I would sit at this window every day
when the sun came up, waiting.

17:03.950 --> 17:05.359
I wonder,

17:06.849 --> 17:09.089
how many times did Bran or Rickon

17:09.220 --> 17:11.430
stare across the moors of Winterfell,

17:11.520 --> 17:13.869
waiting for me to return?

17:13.930 --> 17:17.200
I will never see them again. (SOBBING)

17:19.730 --> 17:21.540
You mustn't think it.

17:22.470 --> 17:26.750
We don't know the truth.
They could be in hiding.

17:30.410 --> 17:32.250
Robb believes they're alive.

17:33.250 --> 17:35.280
And he must go on believing.

17:35.380 --> 17:38.290
He's got to remain strong
if he's to prevail.

17:38.380 --> 17:42.160
And you must remain strong for him.

17:46.160 --> 17:47.570

17:53.630 --> 17:55.110
You're Robb Stark's wife.

17:56.170 --> 17:57.410
Hold still.

17:59.110 --> 18:00.950
Is it true what they say about him?

18:01.010 --> 18:04.420
I don't know. What do they say about him?

18:04.480 --> 18:06.750
That he can turn into a wolf at night.

18:07.850 --> 18:09.490
True.

18:09.580 --> 18:11.820
And he eats the flesh of his enemies.

18:11.920 --> 18:13.760
True.

18:16.660 --> 18:18.690
You're a Lannister, aren't you?

18:18.790 --> 18:21.330
Martyn Lannister.

18:23.160 --> 18:26.610
You've nothing to fear.
My husband doesn't eat children.

18:28.330 --> 18:30.680

19:23.190 --> 19:25.190
You said there was dead crows.

19:25.260 --> 19:27.530
There was.

19:29.700 --> 19:31.400
How many men were here?

19:31.500 --> 19:33.570
About 300.

19:33.670 --> 19:36.010
And you know what those men are now?

19:40.010 --> 19:43.080

MANCE: It's not impossible.
You don't go far betting against Mormont.

19:51.020 --> 19:55.560
But dead or alive,
he took a big gamble coming north.

19:55.620 --> 19:57.600
And he lost.

19:57.690 --> 20:00.100
His best fighting men are dead.

20:00.190 --> 20:03.270

he's Lord Commander of the Night's Watch

20:03.360 --> 20:05.270

20:05.360 --> 20:08.040
he's a long way from home.

20:09.040 --> 20:11.910
Tormund. Climb the Wall.

20:13.310 --> 20:17.120
Take Orell and 20 good men.
And take this one.

20:17.210 --> 20:20.210
He knows Castle
Black's defenses better than any of us.

20:20.280 --> 20:24.990
And if he's useful,
good. If not, throw him off the Wall.

20:25.080 --> 20:27.830
See if crows can fly.

20:27.920 --> 20:31.270
We're finally going to war, old friend?

20:31.320 --> 20:35.300
Hide near Castle Black. When I give
the signal, hit them in the night.

20:35.390 --> 20:39.810

behind, but it only guards one side.

not men. They do not rape.

cities to the sword unless they're ordered.

kill are those you want dead.

When your brother
led his army into battle at the Trident,

because they believed in him,

30:11.370 --> 30:12.820

33:57.200 --> 33:58.870
You're both here to advise me.

33:58.930 --> 34:00.810
I value your advice, but if you ever

34:00.930 --> 34:02.810
question me in front of strangers again,

34:02.900 --> 34:04.470
you'll be advising someone else.

34:05.200 --> 34:06.610
Is that understood?

34:10.440 --> 34:12.120
Do you have a name?

34:12.210 --> 34:14.780
This one's name is Missandei, Your Grace.

34:14.880 --> 34:16.880
Do you have a family? A mother and a father

34:17.050 --> 34:19.050
you'd return to if you had the choice?

34:19.120 --> 34:22.460
No, Your Grace. No family living.

34:22.550 --> 34:25.560
You belong to me now.
It is your duty to tell me the truth.

34:25.620 --> 34:28.159
Yes, Your Grace. Lying is a great offense.

34:28.260 --> 34:31.639
Many of those on the Walk of
Punishment were taken there for less.

34:31.730 --> 34:34.340
I offered water to
a slave dying on the Walk of Punishment.

34:34.429 --> 34:37.610
Do you know
what he said to me? "Let me die."

34:37.670 --> 34:40.340
There are no masters
in the grave, Your Grace.

34:41.570 --> 34:43.780
Is it true what Master Kraznys told me

34:43.909 --> 34:46.150
about the Unsullied? About their obedience?

34:46.239 --> 34:50.820
All questions have been taken from them.
They obey, that is all.

34:50.920 --> 34:53.590
Once they are yours, they are yours.

34:53.650 --> 34:55.760
They will fall on their swords
if you command it.

34:55.820 --> 34:59.290
And what about you?
You know that I'm taking you to war.

34:59.360 --> 35:02.670
You may go hungry. You may fall sick.

35:03.460 --> 35:05.460
You may be killed.

35:05.530 --> 35:07.310
Valar Morghulis.

35:07.370 --> 35:10.810
Yes, all men must die.

35:11.870 --> 35:13.980
But we are not men.

35:24.050 --> 35:27.460
TYRION: A surprising place
to keep the royal ledgers.

35:27.520 --> 35:29.470
LITTLEFINGER:
I'm surprised you're surprised.

35:31.320 --> 35:33.740
This is the safest place in the city.

35:34.660 --> 35:36.540
Not for bastards.

35:37.560 --> 35:39.040
That's all of them, my lord.

35:39.130 --> 35:41.910
TYRION: Thank you, my dear. Pod.

35:42.900 --> 35:45.250
Pod. Take them outside.

35:45.340 --> 35:46.510
I'll be there in a moment.

35:46.640 --> 35:47.840
Yes, my lord.

35:58.650 --> 36:02.000
I hear you owe that boy a significant debt.

36:02.050 --> 36:05.730
Only my life.
Not all that significant, I'm afraid.

36:05.820 --> 36:07.770
You should have him knighted.

36:07.860 --> 36:11.070
If only the Master of Coin had such power.

36:11.930 --> 36:14.000
If only.

36:16.100 --> 36:18.380
I owe you a significant debt.

36:18.440 --> 36:20.780
Our redheaded friend.

36:20.870 --> 36:23.580
You secured her release
when the Queen detained her.

36:23.680 --> 36:25.450
Oh, that.

36:25.540 --> 36:28.620
Of course. A simple misunderstanding.

36:28.710 --> 36:30.520
Apparently, Her Grace believed

36:30.580 --> 36:34.590
that you two had
some sort of special relationship.

36:34.690 --> 36:37.570
We don't. I did fuck her once.

36:37.620 --> 36:39.690
- I know.
- But we don't.

36:39.760 --> 36:41.260
I know.

36:41.360 --> 36:42.960
How's! the Queen get that idea?

36:43.060 --> 36:45.800
Why don't you ask her?

36:49.130 --> 36:51.310
Any advice for me on my new position?

36:51.400 --> 36:54.320
Keep a low profile.

36:54.870 --> 36:57.440
If I had a gold dragon

36:57.540 --> 37:00.790
for every time I heard that joke,
I'd be richer than you are.

37:00.880 --> 37:02.720
Well, you are richer than I am.

37:02.780 --> 37:04.780
Good point.

37:04.880 --> 37:07.960
They're only numbers. Numbers on paper.

37:08.050 --> 37:11.630
Once you understand that,
it's easy to make them behave.

37:11.720 --> 37:16.470
Trivial even.
You want a real challenge? Try whores.

37:16.560 --> 37:22.170
I've tried quite a few.
Well, lots of work to do. Enjoy the Eyrie.

37:24.400 --> 37:28.150
Come on, I'm here later. Come on.

37:31.740 --> 37:33.250
Tonight, then.

37:35.750 --> 37:37.160
Looks like dull reading.

37:37.250 --> 37:39.490
TYRION: You think all
reading is dull reading.

37:39.580 --> 37:42.360
It's an opinion I share
with some of the finest men I know.

37:42.450 --> 37:44.960
The secret history
of the Seven Kingdoms is in these pages.

37:45.020 --> 37:47.770
BRONN: Unless Lord Twatbeard
made up a bunch of numbers

37:47.830 --> 37:49.430
to hide what he's really up to.

37:49.490 --> 37:51.500
Unless he made it all up, yes.

37:51.600 --> 37:52.670
Podrick, do keep up.

37:52.760 --> 37:53.800
Yes, my lord.

37:53.870 --> 37:55.000
Pod rick.

37:55.100 --> 37:56.170
Yes, my lord?

37:56.270 --> 37:59.510
After a long consultation
with my colleague Ser Bronn,

37:59.600 --> 38:02.180
I finally found
a suitable reward for the services

38:02.270 --> 38:05.480
you've provided over and
above what might be considered reasonable.

38:05.540 --> 38:10.790
Tell me, Pod,
have you ever been with a woman?

38:10.850 --> 38:11.950
No, my lord.

38:12.020 --> 38:13.050
Wonderful.

38:14.790 --> 38:18.700
Genna specializes in first-timers.

38:18.790 --> 38:21.360
She's not bad with second-timers, either.

38:21.460 --> 38:23.230
Uh, my lord...

38:23.330 --> 38:25.900
A fair enough repayment
for putting your spear

38:26.000 --> 38:29.380
through my
would-be killer's face, wouldn't you say?

38:30.140 --> 38:32.980
Now, as it happens,

38:33.970 --> 38:35.470
Marei

38:35.540 --> 38:38.650
is quite the spear-handler herself.

38:38.710 --> 38:41.880
She's here to thank you
for staying by my side

38:42.010 --> 38:45.190

38:45.250 --> 38:47.160
MAREI: He's handsome.

38:48.350 --> 38:50.700
You didn't tell me he was handsome.

38:51.390 --> 38:57.270
Kayla is famous
from hereto Volantis in certain circles.

38:57.830 --> 39:04.040
One of four women in the world who can
perform a proper Meereenese Knot.

39:04.100 --> 39:07.110
My lord, I don't even...

39:07.210 --> 39:11.710
TYRION: She's here to thank you for
being a thoroughly respectful fellow,

39:11.780 --> 39:14.450

to address me as "my lord."

TYRION: For years
I've heard that Littlefinger is a magician.

39:31.930 --> 39:34.910
Whenever the crown needs
money, he rubs his hands together

39:34.970 --> 39:37.540
and, poof, mountains of gold.

39:37.600 --> 39:39.910
Let me guess. He's not a magician.

39:39.970 --> 39:41.110
No.

39:43.380 --> 39:44.720
He's stealing it?

39:44.880 --> 39:46.250
Worse, he's borrowing it.

39:47.380 --> 39:48.980
What's wrong with that?

39:49.080 --> 39:52.490
We can't afford to pay it back'
that's what's wrong with it.

39:52.580 --> 39:54.830
The crown owes millions to my father.

39:54.920 --> 39:57.400
Seeing as it's
his grandson's ass on the throne,

39:57.460 --> 39:59.440
I imagine he'll forgive that debt.

39:59.490 --> 40:01.660
Forgive a debt, my father?

40:01.760 --> 40:04.300
For a man of the world,
you're strangely naive,

40:04.400 --> 40:06.070
I've never borrowed money.

40:06.630 --> 40:08.580

and after an agreed upon period of
time, you return it with interest.

40:23.680 --> 40:24.790
What if I don't?

40:25.580 --> 40:26.860
Well, you have to.

40:27.250 --> 40:28.420
But what if I don't?

40:28.790 --> 40:30.820
This is why I don't lend you money.

40:31.520 --> 40:34.000
Anyway, it's not my
father I'm worried about.

40:34.090 --> 40:36.130
It's the Iron Bank of Braavos.

40:36.190 --> 40:38.110
We owe them tens of millions.

40:38.160 --> 40:40.200
If we fail to repay these loans,

40:40.330 --> 40:42.370
the bank will fund our enemies.

This is more than I give you in a year.

Oh, then it's much more
than I give you in a year.

41:12.130 --> 41:13.470
They wouldn't take it, my lord.

41:15.070 --> 41:18.170
Maybe they're trying to curry some
favor with the new Master of Coin.

41:18.240 --> 41:20.220
Have you ever known a whore
to turn down gold?

41:25.180 --> 41:26.710
I didn't tell them anything.

What did you do to them?

Yes, my lord.

We have the numbers. We have the gold.

49:04.340 --> 49:06.370
Aye, you have both.

49:07.940 --> 49:12.120
Fighting bravely
for a losing cause is admirable.

49:12.940 --> 49:17.890
Fighting for a winning cause
is far more rewarding.

49:18.780 --> 49:20.290
Hard to argue with that.

49:23.650 --> 49:26.640
Now that we're speaking
together man to man,

49:26.690 --> 49:31.040
I wonder if you need
to keep me chained to this tree?

49:31.130 --> 49:34.370
I'm not asking to be freed
from my constraints,

49:34.470 --> 49:36.670
but if I could sleep lying down,

49:36.800 --> 49:39.040
my back would thank you for it.

49:39.870 --> 49:42.820
I'm not as young and
resilient as I was once.

49:43.840 --> 49:45.820
None of us are.

49:48.250 --> 49:50.250
Unchain Ser Jaime from the tree.

49:50.350 --> 49:51.690
MAN: Come on, men.

49:58.320 --> 50:01.570
Suppose you'll be wanting something to eat.

50:01.660 --> 50:03.610
I'm famished, actually.

50:03.690 --> 50:06.610
I think we've got a spare
partridge on the fire.

50:06.700 --> 50:09.370
Well, I do like partridge.

50:10.770 --> 50:12.340
(JAIME GROANS SOFTLY)

50:14.940 --> 50:18.790
Bring the bird over here
and the carving knife.

50:22.250 --> 50:24.890
Will this work as a table, my lord?

50:24.950 --> 50:26.720
Oh, yes. Yes, this will do...

50:26.950 --> 50:28.520
(GROANS)

50:28.590 --> 50:30.030
On the stump.

50:36.630 --> 50:38.370
You think you're the smartest man there is.

50:38.530 --> 50:40.270
(GRUNTING)

50:42.130 --> 50:47.480
That everyone alive
has to bow and scrape and lick your boots.

50:47.570 --> 50:48.710
My father...

50:48.870 --> 50:49.940
And if you get in any trouble,

50:50.040 --> 50:53.110
all you've got to do is say "my father"

50:53.210 --> 50:56.050
and that's it, all your troubles are gone.

50:57.880 --> 50:59.120
Don't.

50:59.250 --> 51:00.560
Have you got something to say?

51:01.450 --> 51:02.730
(GRUNTS)

51:04.890 --> 51:07.890
Careful. You don't want
to say the wrong thing.

51:11.430 --> 51:16.470
You're nothing without your
daddy, and your daddy ain't here.

51:17.500 --> 51:19.480
Never forget that.

51:21.440 --> 51:23.080
Here, this should help you remember.

51:24.980 --> 51:28.580
(SCREAMING IN PAIN)

51:31.750 --> 51:34.250
(THE BEAR AND THE MAIDEN FAIR PLAYING)
