00:01.630 --> 00:03.097
<i>Kids, I never would have</i>

00:03.198 --> 00:05.063
<i>met your mother without a little luck.</i>

00:05.200 --> 00:06.895
<i>Specifically, the luck of the Irish.</i>

00:07.569 --> 00:08.627
<i>St. Patrick's Day.</i>

00:08.737 --> 00:10.568
<i>The one day of the year
when every young person</i>

00:10.672 --> 00:12.833
<i>in New York goes out and gets crazy.</i>

00:13.608 --> 00:14.973
<i>Really crazy.</i>

00:15.610 --> 00:17.100
<i>Okay. Maybe not that crazy.</i>

00:17.712 --> 00:22.081
<i>But by 2008, we'd all had enough.
Well, most of us.</i>

00:22.184 --> 00:25.449
Who wants to
kiss the Barney Stone?

00:25.554 --> 00:27.454
- Look it's the Riddler.
- That's not the Riddler.

00:27.556 --> 00:30.491
That's Gumby. Hey, Gumby,
can we tie you in a knot later?

00:30.592 --> 00:33.618
Hey! NBA player sidelined
by a knee injury.

00:34.062 --> 00:36.155
All right, laugh all you want,

00:36.264 --> 00:39.233
but this is my lucky
St. Patty's Day suit. Yup.

00:39.334 --> 00:42.826
I have dry-cleaned
many a stain off of this baby.

00:43.205 --> 00:45.139
You know why it's lucky?
'Cause it's green.

00:45.240 --> 00:47.640
The color of go, as in "Let's."

00:47.742 --> 00:50.939
Barney, we talked this over

00:51.246 --> 00:52.975
and we're not doing St. Patty's Day
this year.

00:54.349 --> 00:55.714
Come on. Let's...

00:56.518 --> 00:57.883
Are you...

00:59.955 --> 01:01.320
Wow, okay.

01:01.556 --> 01:02.989
I think I got to lie down.

01:03.091 --> 01:04.786
Can we shoot pool on you?

01:04.893 --> 01:09.853
No, no!
Unacceptable. That's so not Raven.

01:10.165 --> 01:11.723
Well, what are you going to do instead?

01:11.833 --> 01:13.027
We just got the keys
to our new apartment,

01:13.135 --> 01:16.195
so we're gonna go over there and hang
that painting, have board game night.

01:16.304 --> 01:17.965
You're welcome to join us if you want.

01:18.073 --> 01:19.734
Board game night?

01:20.475 --> 01:23.205
Board game night. Come on!

01:23.712 --> 01:27.113
Let's drink green beer.
Let's do green Jell-O shots.

01:27.215 --> 01:28.739
Where's your St. Patty's Day spirit?

01:28.850 --> 01:32.183
- We're drinking green tea.
- With caffeine.

01:32.754 --> 01:34.346
Sorry, Peter, we're grown-ups now.

01:34.456 --> 01:37.118
We can't fly off to Neverland
with you anymore.

01:37.492 --> 01:39.790
All right, fine.

01:39.895 --> 01:43.092
You know what?
I'll celebrate St. Patty's Day by myself.

01:43.198 --> 01:46.759
I don't need you people.
You make me physically ill!

01:48.603 --> 01:50.662
He did look a little green.

01:55.210 --> 01:56.404
Hello?

01:56.811 --> 01:58.870
Hey. Happy St. Patty's Day.

01:58.980 --> 02:00.880
How are you? Yeah.
I haven't talked to you forever.

02:00.982 --> 02:02.950
- Who is it?
- It's Ted's butt.

02:05.053 --> 02:09.251
Damn it! My phone keeps pocket
dialing. That's like the 8th time today.

02:09.357 --> 02:12.417
In fairness, I did call Ted's butt
at like 2:00 this afternoon.

02:12.527 --> 02:14.427
It took long enough to call you back.

02:17.832 --> 02:19.129
Barney? Where are you?

02:19.234 --> 02:23.603
In a cab, heading downtown with our hot
and sexy dates for the evening.

02:23.705 --> 02:26.367
Yes, it happens that fast!

02:26.775 --> 02:29.505
We're going to that club, Low Point,
and you're coming with us.

02:29.611 --> 02:30.805
Barney, for the last time...

02:30.912 --> 02:33.813
All right, I didn't want to tell you this
in front of Marshall and Lily

02:33.915 --> 02:36.315
because they are old and married
and it's too late for them anyway.

02:36.418 --> 02:40.354
But, Ted, the world is going to
come to an end tonight.

02:41.723 --> 02:43.315
Yes, think about it.

02:43.425 --> 02:46.121
End of the world. Nostradamus.
Notre Dame.

02:46.228 --> 02:49.288
Fighting Irish. Irish. St. Patrick's Day.

02:49.431 --> 02:52.696
This is it, bro. Bro-pocalypse Now.

02:53.602 --> 02:55.092
Bromageddon.

02:55.203 --> 02:57.671
Ted, you are young, you're single.

02:57.772 --> 02:59.205
You will have so much more fun with me.

02:59.307 --> 03:01.935
Do you really want to spend your
last night on Earth

03:02.043 --> 03:04.534
playing board games
with Marshall and Lily?

03:07.182 --> 03:09.548
My hands smell weird. Smell this.

03:10.151 --> 03:12.176
Yeah, they do, that's new.

03:12.687 --> 03:14.746
I'll be there in five minutes.

03:14.990 --> 03:17.584
Yes! All right!

03:17.692 --> 03:19.717
He's in. Ted is a great guy.

03:22.964 --> 03:25.364
You're going to love him.

03:26.167 --> 03:28.795
<i>So, on March 17, 2008,</i>

03:28.937 --> 03:31.531
<i>I went to a big St. Patrick's Day party.</i>

03:31.640 --> 03:34.575
<i>And it's a good thing I did,
because funny story,</i>

03:35.610 --> 03:37.271
<i>your mother was there.</i>

03:55.096 --> 03:57.587
Hi, have you met Ted?

03:57.699 --> 03:58.893
Hi, I'm Mary.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.661
Hi, happy St. Patty's Day.

04:00.769 --> 04:01.861
I haven't met Ted either.

04:01.970 --> 04:03.631
- I'm Stephanie.
- Hi.

04:04.572 --> 04:06.972
Dude, back off. I called dibs on Stephanie.

04:07.075 --> 04:08.667
Okay, Mary's hot.

04:09.911 --> 04:12.641
- Well, then I want Mary.
- Fine.

04:13.515 --> 04:16.712
Oh, I see. Reverse psychology.

04:16.817 --> 04:19.446
Then I'm sticking with Stephanie,
Dr. Freud.

04:19.553 --> 04:20.714
Okay.

04:20.822 --> 04:22.255
- Which one do you want more?
- Either one.

04:22.357 --> 04:24.484
- I want them both.
- You're an idiot.

04:24.592 --> 04:25.820
And it may be a moot point.

04:25.927 --> 04:27.326
I mean, it doesn't look like
we're getting in.

04:27.429 --> 04:28.794
- Dude...
- Look at this.

04:28.897 --> 04:31.798
You know why there's a line?
It's because I ditched Marshall and Lily

04:31.900 --> 04:34.994
and now the universe
is punishing us for it, that's why.

04:39.741 --> 04:40.833
Yo.

04:42.410 --> 04:45.777
What's it going to cost us to get in here?
$20? $40?

04:46.147 --> 04:47.774
Dude, come on, you're making
the wee folk look bad.

04:47.882 --> 04:50.077
Just give him your pot of gold.

04:50.385 --> 04:51.352
Is it just you two?

04:51.453 --> 04:52.715
Don't worry,
we're not gonna blow your ratio.

04:52.821 --> 04:55.483
We happen to have
two very hot girls with us.

04:55.590 --> 04:57.649
Mine's the hotter one.

04:57.759 --> 05:00.819
Yeah. Sorry, guys. Look, if it was just you
two, you can go in right now.

05:00.929 --> 05:02.658
We got nothing but girls in there.

05:02.764 --> 05:06.029
People are gonna start thinking
it's a lesbian bar.

05:06.668 --> 05:09.330
Would you excuse us for just a minute?

05:11.106 --> 05:12.095
Ted, I'm going to be honest.

05:12.207 --> 05:14.607
I was full of it with
that whole Nostradamus thing.

05:14.709 --> 05:16.836
- No!
- But I am starting to think

05:16.945 --> 05:20.506
there is some serious planetary crap
going on here tonight.

05:20.615 --> 05:23.083
Never in the history of
New York City nightclubs

05:23.184 --> 05:25.448
has there been a shortage of dudes.

05:25.587 --> 05:28.522
Not even during the great
dude shortage of 1883.

05:29.324 --> 05:31.053
We've got to ditch these girls.

05:31.159 --> 05:32.649
You dragged them all the way down here.

05:32.761 --> 05:35.389
I don't see no ring on this finger.

05:35.663 --> 05:37.255
All right. Hold on.

05:37.399 --> 05:38.457
Excuse me.

05:38.566 --> 05:41.501
Are the girls in there
hotter than our dates?

05:41.603 --> 05:43.935
I don't know if they're hotter,
but they're drunker.

05:44.038 --> 05:45.630
Rock and roll.

05:49.310 --> 05:51.710
Welcome to your new dream home,
my lady.

05:53.882 --> 05:57.215
All right, all right. You can put me down.
Robin thinks we're weird.

05:57.318 --> 06:00.420
No, it's fine.
It was only weird on the subway.

06:03.124 --> 06:05.490
I'm going to check the other rooms
to see if the previous owners

06:05.593 --> 06:07.618
left us any free stuff.

06:07.762 --> 06:09.889
I'm gonna hang our first piece of art.

06:09.998 --> 06:12.592
Oh, look. There's already a nail.
Hey, Lil, free nail!

06:12.700 --> 06:14.258
Score!

06:17.772 --> 06:19.603
How's that?
- Perfect.

06:20.475 --> 06:21.908
Whoops!

06:26.047 --> 06:27.571
What the...

06:28.516 --> 06:29.676
Huh.

06:29.818 --> 06:33.151
Oh. Now, this is ridiculous.
Is it the nail?

06:33.421 --> 06:35.855
- Marshall.
- Is the wall slippery or something?

06:35.957 --> 06:37.083
- Marshall.
- Is there a wind

06:37.192 --> 06:38.591
or is there some sort of draft in here?

06:38.693 --> 06:40.456
- Marshall.
- What?

06:40.562 --> 06:42.462
Your apartment's crooked.

06:42.897 --> 06:44.228
What do you mean?

06:48.770 --> 06:51.500
<i>It was the kind of thing
you didn't notice until you noticed it.</i>

06:51.606 --> 06:54.404
<i>But once you did notice it,
you couldn't not notice it.</i>

06:54.509 --> 06:57.774
<i>Lily and Marshall's new apartment
was crooked.</i>

07:00.515 --> 07:03.313
Oh, no, no, no!

07:03.418 --> 07:06.080
- Oh, no, no! Oh, no!
- Yes.

07:06.221 --> 07:08.416
Are you telling me that
we just spent our entire life savings

07:08.523 --> 07:10.718
and then some
on a crooked apartment?

07:10.825 --> 07:12.292
Oh, my God!

07:12.427 --> 07:14.452
- Oh, she's gonna flip.
- Look, just calm down. It's nothing.

07:14.562 --> 07:17.861
Look what I found in the kids' room,
free skateboard.

07:17.966 --> 07:21.663
Score. Free Hungry, Hungry Hippo.
Double score!

07:21.769 --> 07:23.703
- I'm going to check the kitchen.
- Okay.

07:23.805 --> 07:25.067
How could she not notice this?

07:25.173 --> 07:27.937
It's like the last 20 minutes
of Titanic in here.

07:28.176 --> 07:29.666
We have to keep this quiet.

07:29.777 --> 07:32.211
If Lily finds out
her new dream house is crooked,

07:32.313 --> 07:34.372
it's gonna break her heart.

07:34.482 --> 07:37.144
Free salad strainer. I love this place.

07:38.319 --> 07:41.015
- Just for tonight, okay?
- Okay.

07:41.990 --> 07:44.584
But it's going to be an uphill battle.

07:44.926 --> 07:48.191
I am just saying we have to
think of the right angle.

07:49.831 --> 07:52.857
I have a third one,
but I'm not going to say it.

07:53.535 --> 07:55.469
Okay. Barney,
I think we've stumbled into some kind of

07:55.570 --> 07:57.299
ethical, philosophical wormhole.

07:57.405 --> 07:58.565
- Green suit.
- Yeah.

07:58.673 --> 08:02.200
I ditched Marshall and Lily
and was rewarded with two beautiful girls.

08:02.310 --> 08:03.607
This suit's made of green.

08:03.711 --> 08:05.906
We bailed on those two beautiful girls

08:06.014 --> 08:08.983
and now we're being rewarded
with a sea of beautiful girls.

08:09.083 --> 08:10.482
38 long.

08:10.618 --> 08:13.951
It's like the laws of the
universe are working in reverse.

08:14.055 --> 08:16.023
- Can you put it on my tab?
- Yeah. What's the last name?

08:16.124 --> 08:17.386
Garido.

08:18.593 --> 08:20.857
All right, I'm going to try something
and if this works...

08:20.962 --> 08:22.759
- Hey.
- Hey, what can I get you guys?

08:22.864 --> 08:24.855
Bottle of Dom Perignon.
And can you put it on my tab?

08:24.966 --> 08:26.866
- Sure. What's the name?
- Garido.

08:26.968 --> 08:28.902
- Dude.
- Oh, yeah. You're right.

08:29.003 --> 08:30.732
Make it two bottles.

08:31.739 --> 08:33.263
Now we wait
and see if something good...

08:33.374 --> 08:34.841
Oh, hello!

08:34.943 --> 08:36.171
St. Patrick's Day tradition.

08:36.277 --> 08:38.404
If you're not wearing green,
you gotta get pinched.

08:38.513 --> 08:40.174
Well, I guess I got what I deserved.

08:40.280 --> 08:42.340
I'm not wearing green either.

08:42.450 --> 08:45.385
This is deep teal.

08:45.486 --> 08:47.511
- The lighting makes it...
- Oh, I'm Ted.

08:47.622 --> 08:50.216
Ashlee with two E's.

08:50.358 --> 08:52.724
Please, C's at most.

08:52.827 --> 08:54.419
You know, you guys should come
join me and my friends.

08:54.529 --> 08:58.795
We have a bottle of tequila
and shockingly deep belly buttons.

09:00.201 --> 09:02.829
Okay, it's official,
do bad things, good things happen.

09:04.839 --> 09:08.206
Ted, listen, are you hearing that?
That's the universe.

09:08.309 --> 09:10.140
The universe is talking to us.

09:10.244 --> 09:12.474
We don't have to build a baseball field,
do we?

09:12.580 --> 09:17.574
No, the universe is telling us
that we have a free pass tonight.

09:17.685 --> 09:22.486
The universe is saying that we don't have
to live in fear of the... Are you still there?

09:22.590 --> 09:23.716
Yeah, I'm here.

09:23.825 --> 09:26.623
The repercussions of our actions.

09:26.728 --> 09:30.562
There is no waiting for tomorrow
because do you know why, Ted?

09:33.434 --> 09:36.062
There is no tomorrow.

09:36.738 --> 09:38.296
No tomorrow, huh?

09:38.406 --> 09:39.930
By the way, Mr. Garido,

09:40.041 --> 09:43.568
your second bottle of champagne gets you
a complimentary ounce of caviar.

09:43.678 --> 09:44.838
Enjoy.

09:48.049 --> 09:50.210
- No tomorrow!
- No tomorrow!

09:50.318 --> 09:52.149
- No tomorrow!
- No tomorrow!

09:52.253 --> 09:54.312
Hey, wonder what the
grown-ups are doing right now?

09:59.927 --> 10:03.158
I win again! Why do I keep winning?

10:04.065 --> 10:06.898
Maybe your hippo is just hungrier,
hungrier than ours.

10:07.001 --> 10:09.265
That's it. That's what is. It's not gravity.

10:09.370 --> 10:11.531
That's for sure. I'll tell you that.

10:11.639 --> 10:14.301
Whoa! What was that?

10:19.380 --> 10:21.143
What's going on here?

10:23.518 --> 10:25.179
Okay, Lily.

10:25.653 --> 10:28.884
While you were in the other room,
Robin and I...

10:28.990 --> 10:31.049
We discovered something
about the apartment.

10:31.159 --> 10:34.185
It's not a big deal. It's not...
It's not like a disaster.

10:34.295 --> 10:38.823
It's just... It's something that
we're going to have to learn to live with.

10:41.502 --> 10:43.436
Robin and I saw a ghost.

10:44.272 --> 10:47.469
What? Oh, he's kidding, right?

10:47.575 --> 10:49.736
No, we really saw a ghost.

10:50.278 --> 10:51.939
What did it look like?

10:52.513 --> 10:55.141
A sheet with two holes in it.

10:56.551 --> 11:00.578
He was a Confederate general who was
wounded at the battle of Antietam

11:00.688 --> 11:05.318
and he died at the army hospital
which once stood on this very spot.

11:05.426 --> 11:07.257
And now he wanders these halls

11:07.361 --> 11:11.297
vowing revenge against the Union
cannonade that once felled him.

11:11.632 --> 11:14.032
But he seems nice.
He's a good... Good guy.

11:14.435 --> 11:18.565
Marshall, you see ghosts everywhere.
You see ghosts at Starbucks.

11:18.673 --> 11:22.370
That Kenny G holiday CD
just flew off the shelf.

11:22.477 --> 11:24.411
Last time that happened.

11:24.512 --> 11:28.573
But, Robin, you're a skeptic,
so if you say you saw a ghost...

11:31.419 --> 11:36.049
It passed right through me and suddenly
I felt cold. So very cold.

11:40.328 --> 11:41.920
You know, Ashlee...

11:42.029 --> 11:44.657
I'm sorry. You're probably just gonna want
to get up and walk away,

11:44.766 --> 11:48.031
but I just have to test out this theory
I've been working on.

11:48.136 --> 11:50.798
Tonight, I'm not looking for a relationship.

11:50.905 --> 11:53.135
I really just want to hook up with you,

11:53.241 --> 11:55.334
leave before breakfast
and never see you again.

11:55.443 --> 11:56.637
Hmm.

11:57.912 --> 12:00.380
- I'm in.
- Unbelievable.

12:02.784 --> 12:05.082
Hot damn, that's a deep navel!

12:05.520 --> 12:08.080
- No tomorrow, Ted!
- Yeah. No tomorrow, Barney.

12:09.357 --> 12:11.416
No tomorrow, huh?

12:11.526 --> 12:12.857
I like that idea.

12:13.728 --> 12:16.128
Because if there is a tomorrow,

12:16.230 --> 12:20.030
- I'm going to be in a lot of trouble.
- Oh, yeah? Why is that?

12:20.635 --> 12:22.000
I'm married.

12:26.741 --> 12:28.766
Tell me you're messing with me, guys.

12:28.876 --> 12:30.571
You didn't actually see a ghost.

12:30.678 --> 12:33.545
It's not a big deal, baby.
He seemed friendly.

12:33.648 --> 12:36.549
You said he's a Confederate general.
They're the bad guys.

12:36.651 --> 12:40.553
- And he's probably racist!
- No! He seemed polite.

12:40.655 --> 12:43.123
He had courtly Southern manners.

12:43.224 --> 12:45.124
We're gonna raise our kids here.

12:45.226 --> 12:49.094
I don't want some Confederate general
ghost teaching them his racism!

12:49.197 --> 12:52.428
He loves people of all colors and creeds.

12:52.533 --> 12:54.524
He was fighting for states' rights.
That's all.

12:54.635 --> 12:57.502
Robin said he was wearing a sheet,
what do you think that means?

12:57.605 --> 12:59.835
- Robin...
- The apartment is crooked!

13:01.008 --> 13:02.168
What?

13:04.212 --> 13:06.544
Robin and I didn't see a ghost.

13:09.383 --> 13:11.783
The floor is crooked, isn't it?

13:12.553 --> 13:13.713
Yeah.

13:14.889 --> 13:18.723
We spent our entire
life savings on this floor.

13:18.826 --> 13:21.795
The next 30 mortgage-paying years
of our lives

13:21.896 --> 13:25.093
will be spent on this floor and it's crooked!

13:32.440 --> 13:34.431
Thanks a lot, Robin.

13:36.444 --> 13:39.572
How is racist ghost better than crooked?

13:41.315 --> 13:44.045
Seriously, somebody tell me
how that's better. Please.

13:46.387 --> 13:49.049
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Oh, that's okay.

13:49.490 --> 13:51.890
Dude, so I'm having second thoughts
about that theory.

13:51.993 --> 13:55.861
I'm telling you, if you want to know how
old a woman is, check her elbows.

13:55.963 --> 13:58.295
- Not that theory.
- Well, you have to be more specific, Ted,

13:58.399 --> 13:59.923
'cause I have so many theories.

14:00.034 --> 14:02.696
The whole do bad, good things happen.

14:02.803 --> 14:05.328
- Ashlee is married.
- So?

14:05.439 --> 14:06.929
What do you mean, "So"?

14:07.041 --> 14:08.531
Open your brain tank, bra,

14:08.643 --> 14:12.170
'cause here comes
some Premium 91 octane knowledge.

14:12.313 --> 14:13.803
There's three rules of cheating.

14:13.915 --> 14:16.315
It's not cheating
if you're not the one who's married.

14:16.417 --> 14:19.682
It's not cheating
if her name has two adjacent vowels.

14:19.787 --> 14:22.051
And it's not cheating
if she's from a different area code.

14:22.156 --> 14:23.646
You're fine on all three counts.

14:23.758 --> 14:25.521
How do you know
she's from a different area code?

14:25.626 --> 14:27.958
She's 516.

14:28.062 --> 14:31.054
She might dress like she's 718,
act like she's 212,

14:31.165 --> 14:33.099
but trust me, she is 516.

14:33.200 --> 14:36.692
Oh, and her husband letting her
out alone on St. Patty's Day,

14:36.804 --> 14:39.864
if that dude's not 973, I'm 307.

14:41.642 --> 14:42.973
- Wyoming.
- Oh.

14:47.148 --> 14:49.309
We're gonna have to nail down
all our furniture.

14:49.417 --> 14:51.851
We won't be able to get a pinball machine.

14:51.953 --> 14:55.150
I mean, unless we put some books under
two of the legs or something.

14:55.256 --> 14:58.817
But then, what if we wanna read
those books? This is a nightmare.

14:58.926 --> 15:02.327
We can't raise our kids here.
They'll grow up slanted.

15:02.430 --> 15:05.695
If we have a daughter,
we'll have to call her Ilene.

15:06.267 --> 15:08.861
I don't think we can live here, Marshall.

15:09.303 --> 15:11.464
I don't know what we're gonna do.

15:12.106 --> 15:14.870
Marshall? Open the door.

15:25.720 --> 15:28.985
If I make it to the door,
that's five points.

15:32.360 --> 15:33.554
Yeah!

15:34.962 --> 15:36.054
Five points!

15:36.163 --> 15:38.654
Ten bucks says I can do it backwards.

15:38.766 --> 15:42.395
<i>So Lily and Marshall decided
to make the best of a bad situation,</i>

15:42.503 --> 15:46.371
<i>and that's also how the sport of
apartment roller luge was invented.</i>

15:46.507 --> 15:49.533
Very careful, very, very... Oh, yeah!

15:50.111 --> 15:52.511
So she's married.
It's not like she has kids.

15:52.613 --> 15:54.137
How do you know?

15:54.248 --> 15:57.411
Wrists!
It's like you don't even listen to me.

15:58.953 --> 16:01.353
- Oh, hey. Hey.
- Hey. Where'd you go?

16:01.489 --> 16:03.582
- Well, I just...
- Was it something I said?

16:03.691 --> 16:06.819
No, no, no, it's just...
Well, you're married

16:06.927 --> 16:10.192
and we've been drinking
and I was worried we might...

16:10.531 --> 16:12.897
Oh, this is a very bad idea.

16:15.269 --> 16:18.432
- We have a problem.
- Hey, hey, hey.

16:19.874 --> 16:23.571
- Is this your husband?
- I've never seen this man in my life.

16:23.844 --> 16:25.869
Okay, what's our problem?

16:26.380 --> 16:29.076
Rick, Rick Garido.
According to the bartender,

16:29.183 --> 16:32.209
I'm the guy that's been
buying you champagne all night.

16:32.319 --> 16:35.447
Okay, there's a very simple explanation.

16:36.223 --> 16:37.918
Next thing I know,
the police show up,

16:38.025 --> 16:41.426
they arrest the other guy and
I'm drinking for free the rest of the night.

16:41.529 --> 16:43.087
It was awesome!

16:44.932 --> 16:46.957
- Awesome, huh?
- Yeah.

16:47.902 --> 16:50.097
You don't see anything wrong
with that story?

16:50.204 --> 16:52.672
Well, I lost my new phone
back at the club somewhere.

16:52.773 --> 16:55.173
What the hell is wrong with you, dude?

16:55.276 --> 16:57.141
You know me, I lose things.

16:57.244 --> 16:59.576
You kissed a married woman, Ted.

16:59.680 --> 17:02.171
You committed credit card fraud.

17:02.283 --> 17:06.151
You kissed a married woman.
Do you know how offensive that is to me?

17:06.252 --> 17:09.381
You're turning into Barney.
We don't need another Barney.

17:11.025 --> 17:13.016
It's St. Patty's Day!

17:13.426 --> 17:17.089
- It wasn't as bad as it sounds.
- It wasn't as bad as it sounds?

17:17.198 --> 17:18.825
- No!
- Huh? Okay.

17:18.933 --> 17:21.628
I want you to hear exactly
how it sounds, Ted.

17:23.137 --> 17:24.536
First skipped message.

17:24.637 --> 17:26.367
I don't see no ring
on this finger.

17:26.473 --> 17:29.068
<i>And then last night
started coming back to me.</i>

17:29.243 --> 17:30.574
<i>The real version.</i>

17:30.978 --> 17:33.742
Are the girls in there
hotter than our dates?

17:33.848 --> 17:37.011
I don't know if they're hotter,
but they're drunker.

17:37.118 --> 17:38.608
Rock and roll.

17:42.590 --> 17:45.184
- How many messages did I...
- Seventeen.

17:46.026 --> 17:47.926
<i>Kids, it's sometimes possible to think</i>

17:48.028 --> 17:49.461
<i>you're doing just fine in life.</i>

17:49.563 --> 17:50.757
Next message.

17:51.198 --> 17:53.063
Can you put it on my tab?

17:53.167 --> 17:56.364
- Sure. What's the last name?
- Garido.

17:56.470 --> 17:58.529
<i>And then someone
opens your eyes a little bit</i>

17:58.639 --> 18:00.004
<i>and you realize...</i>

18:00.107 --> 18:01.438
Next message.

18:01.542 --> 18:03.305
I really want to hook up with you,

18:03.410 --> 18:06.277
leave before breakfast
and then never see you again.

18:06.580 --> 18:08.946
<i>Your whole world is off balance.</i>

18:09.049 --> 18:10.414
Next message.

18:10.518 --> 18:11.485
<i>Out of whack.</i>

18:11.585 --> 18:16.522
Okay, look, bra, there's a very simple...

18:16.824 --> 18:18.018
<i>Crooked.</i>

18:20.694 --> 18:21.786
Wow!

18:22.463 --> 18:24.328
That was hard to listen to.

18:26.133 --> 18:29.398
No one likes how they sound
on an answering machine.

18:30.871 --> 18:32.736
Thanks for doing that.

18:35.576 --> 18:36.907
You yelled at me.

18:37.378 --> 18:40.176
You got very firm with me.
Very confident.

18:40.714 --> 18:42.113
It was cool.

18:42.216 --> 18:43.513
Thanks.

18:43.617 --> 18:45.107
You're very sexy when you yell, Marshall.

18:45.219 --> 18:46.311
Shut up.

18:46.420 --> 18:48.183
Veins, crazy muscles in your neck.

18:48.289 --> 18:50.257
You're like
a Kentucky-Derby-winning steed.

18:50.357 --> 18:51.551
You're ruining a nice moment.

18:51.659 --> 18:53.786
At one point, I swear,
I thought we were going to kiss...

18:53.894 --> 18:56.260
Ted, seriously.

18:56.363 --> 18:57.728
I'm married.

18:59.366 --> 19:02.301
Oh, a slanted floor.

19:02.403 --> 19:04.337
Architecturally speaking,
fixing that's gonna be...

19:04.438 --> 19:07.236
Very, very, very expensive.

19:07.341 --> 19:10.003
And it's going to take some time too,

19:10.110 --> 19:13.477
so it looks like you're stuck with us
for a little while longer, if that's okay.

19:13.581 --> 19:15.344
Are you kidding? I love it.

19:15.449 --> 19:18.145
I don't know what's going to happen to me
without you guys around.

19:18.252 --> 19:21.312
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to get my stupid phone.

19:22.923 --> 19:25.721
<i>So that was St. Patrick's Day, 2008.</i>

19:25.826 --> 19:28.727
<i>I found out years later
that your mom was at that party,</i>

19:28.829 --> 19:30.694
<i>I just didn't meet her.</i>

19:30.798 --> 19:32.288
<i>You know, it's a good thing I didn't.</i>

19:32.399 --> 19:35.562
<i>Because if I had met her,
I don't think she would have liked me.</i>

19:35.669 --> 19:37.603
<i>Heck, I don't think I liked me.</i>

19:37.705 --> 19:40.503
<i>But that's okay. Tomorrow had arrived.</i>

19:42.042 --> 19:43.669
Leave me alone, and there'll be

19:43.777 --> 19:49.181
No one to get hurt

19:49.717 --> 19:51.582
Nobody move

19:51.685 --> 19:58.591
And there'll be nothin' to disturb

19:59.126 --> 20:02.061
The sum of it all is that

20:02.162 --> 20:08.260
You don't know where to turn

20:08.602 --> 20:11.628
Despite all your promises

20:11.739 --> 20:16.438
You don't keep what you learn

20:16.543 --> 20:21.845
<i>You see, I didn't know it yet,
but my luck was about to change.</i>

20:21.949 --> 20:27.785
Get me out of this mess

20:46.206 --> 20:47.730
I'm awesome!
