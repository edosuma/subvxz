00:04.400 --> 00:06.334
GIRL: DAD SAID NO SCREENS.

00:06.370 --> 00:07.598
BOY: HE'S GOT ONE.

00:07.640 --> 00:10.336
MINE'S FOR EMERGENCIES.
GIVE IT UP.

00:10.370 --> 00:12.804
COME ON, IT'S TWO NIGHTS.
I THINK YOU CAN HANDLE IT.

00:12.840 --> 00:14.637
GIRL: YEAH? ARE YOU GIVING
YOURS UP, TOO?

00:14.680 --> 00:16.045
MAYBE I WILL.

00:16.080 --> 00:18.173
HOW WOULD WE KNOW?
YOU'RE NOT EVEN COMING.

00:18.210 --> 00:19.768
AND NEITHER
IS MRS. ARCHER

00:19.820 --> 00:22.448
BECAUSE IT'S
A DAD-KID ADVENTURE.

00:22.490 --> 00:25.709
GIVE YOUR MOM A BREAK.

00:30.430 --> 00:31.556
YOU GONNA BE OK?

00:31.590 --> 00:32.659
I PROMISE.

00:32.700 --> 00:33.826
OK.

00:33.860 --> 00:35.748
BE GOOD.

00:41.240 --> 00:43.105
I'M GONNA MISS YOU GUYS.

00:43.140 --> 00:44.368
WE'LL MISS YOU, MOM.

00:44.410 --> 00:47.299
HAVE A FUN TIME.

00:47.340 --> 00:50.503
[TRUCK DOORS CLOSE,
ENGINE STARTS]

01:04.630 --> 01:08.623
MAN: * WIND SWEEPS DOWN
FROM THE SKY... *

01:11.670 --> 01:15.128
TRISH, HEY! YOU FINALLY
GAVE IN TO GIRLS NIGHT.

01:15.170 --> 01:16.364
THANKS FOR NOT
GIVING UP ON ME.

01:16.410 --> 01:17.434
NEVER.

01:17.470 --> 01:18.437
FROM THE GUYS
AT THE BAR.

01:18.470 --> 01:19.778
WHICH ONE?

01:21.640 --> 01:24.200
OH, GOD, IS THAT
ROBBIE STURGESS?

01:24.250 --> 01:25.808
TELL ME HE'S JUST
PASSING THROUGH.

01:25.850 --> 01:27.647
I HEARD HE CAN'T LEAVE
'CAUSE HE'S STILL ON PROBATION.

01:27.680 --> 01:30.740
OF COURSE HE IS.
WHO'S THAT WITH HIM?

01:30.790 --> 01:33.588
HIS COUSIN RICK.

01:33.620 --> 01:35.315
TO TRISH.

01:36.630 --> 01:38.279
WHOO!

01:38.330 --> 01:40.423
WOMAN: * I WENT
TO HAVE SOME FUN *

01:43.630 --> 01:45.825
* I'M 0 AND 7...

01:45.870 --> 01:47.531
WHOO WHOO!

01:47.570 --> 01:48.867
HEY, COMIN' IN, COMIN' IN.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.709
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
HERE BEFORE.

01:50.740 --> 01:53.174
YOUR OLD MAN KNOW
YOU'RE DANCING WITH ME?

01:53.210 --> 01:54.199
NO, BECAUSE I'M NOT.

01:54.240 --> 01:55.901
OH, YOU COME DRESSED
LIKE THAT

01:55.940 --> 01:58.408
'CAUSE YOU WANT TO DANCE
WITH SOME GIRLS, YEAH.

01:58.450 --> 01:59.747
THAT'S HOT.

01:59.780 --> 02:00.872
LEAVE HER ALONE, RICK.

02:00.920 --> 02:03.616
OH, WHAT'S THE MATTER?
YOU WANT ME TO GO?

02:03.650 --> 02:06.710
YEAH. YEAH, I DO.

02:09.790 --> 02:11.621
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.

02:11.660 --> 02:14.720
HEY, LET'S GO
GET A SMOKE.

02:14.760 --> 02:18.321
WOMAN: * I LIKE THE BOYS
AND I ENJOY... *

02:20.640 --> 02:23.768
OOP. THE BALL AND CHAIN.

02:23.810 --> 02:24.560
HI.

02:24.610 --> 02:26.601
MAN: HEY, YOU STILL
WITH THE LADIES?

02:26.640 --> 02:28.471
HA. YEAH, THEY'RE STILL
DANCING, BUT I'M
GETTING SOME AIR.

02:28.510 --> 02:29.738
YOU SMOKIN', BARB?

02:29.780 --> 02:32.874
NO, I'M NOT SMOKING.
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

02:32.920 --> 02:34.615
YOU BREATHE LIKE
YOU'RE SMOKING.

02:34.650 --> 02:35.776
YOU TOLD ME THAT
YOU QUIT SMOKING.

02:40.320 --> 02:42.959
RICK: YOU KNOW, YOU HURT
MY FEELINGS IN THERE.

02:42.990 --> 02:45.185
AREN'T YOU GOING
TO SAY SORRY?

02:45.230 --> 02:47.698
ABOUT WHAT, SAYING NO?

02:47.730 --> 02:51.791
MM, THAT'S NOT
WHAT YOU SAID.

02:51.830 --> 02:54.765
YEAH. THAT'S WHAT
YOU SAID.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.199
GET OFF ME, YOU BASTARD.

02:56.240 --> 02:58.868
DO YOU KISS YOUR BABIES
WITH THAT FILTHY MOUTH?

02:58.910 --> 03:00.673
GO ON, I SAW YOU LOOKING
FOR ME IN THERE. YOU--

03:00.710 --> 03:01.677
GET OFF!
OOH!

03:02.850 --> 03:06.638
YEAH,
YOU'D BE'I'I'ER RUN!

03:06.680 --> 03:08.671
WE'RE GONNA GO.
SEE YOU LATER.

03:08.720 --> 03:09.687
SEE YOU LATER.

03:09.720 --> 03:11.813
YEAH.

03:11.850 --> 03:14.410
I'VE GOT A JACKET
IN MY CAR. I'LL GET THAT.

03:14.460 --> 03:15.757
NO, NO, I'M FINE.

03:15.790 --> 03:17.428
ARE WE DONE?

03:17.460 --> 03:21.248
YEAH. I JUST ISSUED
AN APB ON STURGESS.

03:21.300 --> 03:22.824
DO YOU WANT ME
TO CALL STEVE?

03:22.870 --> 03:24.667
NO, NO,
HE'LL JUST FREAK OUT.

03:24.700 --> 03:26.338
AND THE KIDS
ARE ASLEEP BY NOW.

03:26.370 --> 03:27.462
I'M FINE.

03:27.500 --> 03:28.728
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
A RIDE HOME.

03:28.770 --> 03:29.805
OK.

03:33.840 --> 03:36.968
REALLY? YOU DIDN'T
TURN YOUR ALARM ON?

03:37.010 --> 03:39.478
I KEEP FORGE'ITING
THE CODE.

03:39.520 --> 03:42.978
I DON'T FEEL RIGHT
LEAVING YOU HERE
WITHOUT IT ON.

03:43.020 --> 03:44.908
I'LL BE OK.

03:44.950 --> 03:47.384
THANK YOU FOR THIS.

03:47.420 --> 03:49.786
AND AGAIN, I'M REALLY
SORRY FOR THE TROUBLE.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.582
IT'S REALLY EM BARRASSING.

03:51.630 --> 03:54.724
STURGESS IS THE ONE
THAT'S GONNA BE SORRY, OK?

03:54.760 --> 03:57.558
YOU CALL ME
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING?

03:57.600 --> 04:00.296
WILL DO. THANK YOU, MACK.
GOOD NIGHT.

04:00.340 --> 04:01.898
GOOD NIGHT.

04:41.710 --> 04:43.678
AAH!

05:39.640 --> 05:41.631
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
ABC STUDIOS, LLC AND CBS, INC.

PRENTISS: "MY DARK SECRETS
ARE LIFE-THREATENING.

05:51.680 --> 05:53.716

SUE TOWNSEND.

05:59.150 --> 06:02.927
OH, MY GOSH. YOU GUYS,
THIS MIGHT BE A RECORD.

06:02.960 --> 06:04.587
IT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT
AFTER NEW YEAR'S

06:04.630 --> 06:06.996
AND WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA
CELEBRATE OUR MHM TONIGHT.

06:07.030 --> 06:07.997
AREN'T YOU EXCITED?

06:08.030 --> 06:10.590
I WILL BE IN A MINUTE.
WHAT'S MHM?

06:10.630 --> 06:14.031
OH, GARCIA NAMED THEM.
IT'S A MISSED HOLIDAY MEAL.

06:14.070 --> 06:17.733
OR AS I LIKE
TO CALL THEM, MM-HMM.

06:17.770 --> 06:19.601
MM-HMM. ACTUALLY,
IT'S A PERFECT TIME

06:19.640 --> 06:22.108
BECAUSE SPENCE JUST
GOT BACK FROM HIS SEMINAR.

06:22.140 --> 06:24.938
PUT ON YOUR
RAIN-CHECK BOOTS.

06:26.150 --> 06:27.515
WHAT DO WE HAVE?

06:27.550 --> 06:28.744
NO TIME TO SIT.

06:28.780 --> 06:31.010
TRISH GAINES.

06:31.050 --> 06:32.187
SHE WAS BEATEN
NEARLY TO DEATH,

06:32.220 --> 06:34.108
PARTIALLY BURIED,
AND RESUSCITATED

06:34.160 --> 06:36.082
IN A GRAVE IN HITCHENS.

06:36.120 --> 06:37.052
SHE'S THE CHIEF
OF POLICE'S WIFE.

06:37.090 --> 06:38.682
SHE WAS FOUND
IN A NATIONAL PARK

06:38.730 --> 06:40.925
100 MILES FROM HERE.
MAKES IT A FEDERAL CASE.

06:40.960 --> 06:43.019
WE ALSO HAVE
A SUSPECT ON THE RUN.

06:43.070 --> 06:43.820
RICK STURGESS.

06:43.870 --> 06:45.861
HE WAS SEEN HARASSING
TRISH AT A BAR

06:45.900 --> 06:47.128
JUST HOURS BEFORE
SHE WAS FOUND.

06:47.170 --> 06:48.637
HE'S DONE TIME
FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT.

06:48.670 --> 06:49.967
HE'S NEVER
KILLED BEFORE.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.534
BUT HE HAS
AN OUTSTANDING WARRANT.

06:51.570 --> 06:52.707
WHICH IS WHY WE'RE
TEAMING UP WITH THE MARSHALS.

06:52.740 --> 06:54.173
BUT I'M NOT RULING OUT
ANY SUSPECT S.

06:54.210 --> 06:56.474
WHOEVER WANTED TRISH DEAD
IS STILL OUT THERE.

06:56.510 --> 06:59.172
WE'LL HIT THE ROAD IN 10.

07:02.690 --> 07:05.818
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT
TRISH GAINES AND HER FAMILY?

07:05.850 --> 07:08.182
GARCIA: THEY MOVED TO HITCHENS
ABOUT A YEAR AGO FROM ASHBURN.

07:08.220 --> 07:09.551
THAT'S RIGHT OUTSIDE OF D.C.

07:09.590 --> 07:11.126
AND WAY MORE COSMOPOLITAN
THAN THIS.

07:11.160 --> 07:12.024
YEAH, IT LOOKS
LIKE STEVE GAINES

07:12.060 --> 07:13.698
WAS THE CHIEF THERE, TOO.

07:13.730 --> 07:16.051
RAN FOR MAYOR BUT LOST,
SO HE TOOK THE LATERAL MOVE.

07:16.100 --> 07:17.522
YEAH, I WONDER
HOW HE FEELS ABOUT THAT.

07:17.570 --> 07:19.538
WHAT ABOUT TRISH?
DOES SHE WORK?

07:19.570 --> 07:21.128
UH, SHE HAD A JOB
AT THE KIDS' OLD SCHOOL.

07:21.170 --> 07:22.865
SHE HASN'T LANDED
ANYTHING HERE YET.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.639
WELL, IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
THERE'S A BOOMING ECONOMY

07:24.670 --> 07:27.002
AND WE'VE PASSED A LOT
OF VACANT STORES.

07:27.040 --> 07:29.031
ANY CHANCE TRISH KNEW
RICK STURGESS

07:29.080 --> 07:30.240
BEFORE THE BAR LAST NIGHT?

07:30.280 --> 07:31.679
NOT THAT I CAN TELL.

07:31.710 --> 07:33.211
NEITHER ONE OF THEM
ARE ON SOCIAL MEDIA.

07:33.250 --> 07:35.013
STURGESS DOESN'T EVEN
HAVE A PHYSICAL ADDRESS.

07:35.050 --> 07:37.780
THIS LEVEL OF VIOLENCE
SUGGESTS A PERSONAL
CONNECTION.

07:37.820 --> 07:40.209
OR A REJECTION. I MEAN,
A GUY WITH STURGESS' RECORD

07:40.260 --> 07:41.158
WOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN THAT WELL.

07:41.190 --> 07:43.750
STURGESS SERVED 5 YEARS
FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT.

07:43.790 --> 07:45.155
WHICH MEANS WHEN
HE WAS LOCKED UP,

07:45.190 --> 07:48.193
HE LEARNED NEXT TIME
DON'T LEAVE A WITNESS.

07:48.230 --> 07:50.994
ONLY HE DID. WHY DIDN'T HE
MAKE SURE TRISH WAS DEAD?

07:51.030 --> 07:53.692
MAYBE HE WANTED TO PUNISH HER
BY BURYING HER ALIVE.

07:53.740 --> 07:55.833
JJ, GO TO THE HOSPITAL.
TRISH IS STILL IN A COMA,

07:55.870 --> 07:57.167
BUT TALK TO HER HUSBAND.

07:57.210 --> 07:58.837
MAYBE HE HAD
A RUN-IN WITH STURGESS

07:58.870 --> 08:00.633
THAT WOULD MAKE THIS
EVEN MORE PERSONAL.

08:00.680 --> 08:03.945
DAVE, MATT, COVER THE HOUSE
AND THE BURIAL SITE.

08:03.980 --> 08:05.777
ALVEZ: WHAT DO YOU WANT US
TO DO FROM HERE, BOSS?

08:05.810 --> 08:08.017
GATHER A LIST OF WITNESSES
FROM THE BAR LAST NIGHT,

08:08.050 --> 08:09.688
ALSO THE HIKERS WHO FOUND HER.

08:09.720 --> 08:12.655
GO THROUGH THE LOCAL PD's
INTERVIEWS WITH EVERYONE.

08:12.690 --> 08:15.250
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT
THEY HAD FOR BREAKFAST.

08:16.790 --> 08:17.927
I SHOULDN'T HAVE LEFT HER.

08:17.960 --> 08:21.157
STEVE WAS GONE FOR ONE NIGHT
AND I DIDN'T KEEP TRISH SAFE.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.519
THAT'S NOT YOUR JOB.

08:22.570 --> 08:23.821
YEAH, BUT IT HAPPENED
ON MY WATCH.

08:23.870 --> 08:25.690
HE SAID HE HADN'T
LEFT HER ALONE BEFORE.

08:25.730 --> 08:27.197
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

08:27.240 --> 08:29.231
I DIDN'T PRY.

08:29.270 --> 08:31.966
LOOK, I'M WRAPPING UP
TH ESE WITNESS STATEMENTS,

08:32.010 --> 08:33.705
BUT BARB STANHOPE WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU DIRECTLY.

08:33.740 --> 08:36.174
OK. THAN KS.

08:37.310 --> 08:39.540
HI. I'M EMILY PRENTISS.

08:39.580 --> 08:40.842
I'M WITH THE FBI.

08:40.880 --> 08:42.916
THEY SAID THAT RICK
TRIED TO KILL TRISH?

08:42.950 --> 08:45.316
WHAT IF HE COMES BACK
TO ACTUALLY DO IT?

08:45.350 --> 08:48.319
WE HAVE AGENTS
PROTECTING HER.

08:48.360 --> 08:51.158
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU WANTED TO TELL ME

08:51.190 --> 08:53.750
THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT TO SHARE
WITH ASSISTANT CHIEF MACKENSIE?

08:53.800 --> 08:57.019
UH...IT'S JUST, UH,

08:57.070 --> 08:58.992
I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK
OUT OF TURN OR ANYTHING,

08:59.030 --> 09:01.965
BUT, UH,
TRISH GOT MORE TEXTS

09:02.000 --> 09:04.036
FROM HER HUSBAND
LAST NIGHT THAN I DID,

09:04.070 --> 09:06.265
AND I THOUGHT
MY GUY WAS OBSESSED.

09:06.310 --> 09:08.232
DID SHE SEEM WORRIED
OR UPSET?

09:08.280 --> 09:11.204
NO. I JUST NOTICED IT
AND I WASN'T SURE

09:11.250 --> 09:13.047
IF I SHOULD SAY
ANYTHING TO MACK,

09:13.080 --> 09:14.240
'CAUSE
HE'S SO PROTECTIVE.

09:14.280 --> 09:16.919
YOU KNOW,
THE BROTHERHOOD
OF COPS AND ALL.

09:16.950 --> 09:18.781
WE APPRECIATE
YOU LETTING US KNOW.

09:18.820 --> 09:20.879
I HOPE YOU FIND HIM.

09:39.370 --> 09:41.133
HI. CHIEF GAINES?

09:41.180 --> 09:43.171
I'M JENNIFER JAREAU
OF THE BAU.

09:43.210 --> 09:46.304
HAVE YOU FOUND
THE SON OF A BITCH?

09:46.350 --> 09:48.671
NOT YET.

09:48.720 --> 09:51.211
THE DOCTOR SAID
HE BASHED HER HEAD IN

09:51.250 --> 09:52.717
AND THE SWELLING IS...

09:52.760 --> 09:54.318
KEEPING HER UNCONSCIOUS?

09:54.360 --> 09:59.252
YEAH. THEY'RE RUNNING A KIT
JUST IN CASE. YOU KNOW.

09:59.290 --> 10:02.020
UH, IF HE DID,

10:02.060 --> 10:03.368
THEY'LL BE ABLE
TO MATCH DNA

10:03.400 --> 10:06.096
AND THIS WILL
END QUICKLY.

10:06.130 --> 10:07.336
AND WHAT IF
IT DOESN'T MATCH?

10:07.370 --> 10:09.736
WHAT IF HE'S NOT THE GUY?

10:09.770 --> 10:12.330
WHOEVER DID THIS WILL
BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE.

10:12.370 --> 10:16.306
WELL, I HOPE YOU FIND HIM
BEFORE I DO.

10:16.340 --> 10:18.103
CHIEF--

10:18.150 --> 10:20.243
CAN I TALK TO YOU OUTSIDE?

10:32.330 --> 10:35.322
HI. HI, I'M JJ.

10:35.360 --> 10:38.796
SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN SAFE
IF WE ALL HAD GONE CAMPING.

10:38.830 --> 10:41.264
IT WAS JUST DADS
AND KIDS, REMEMBER?

10:41.300 --> 10:43.234
I KNOW, BUT STILL...

10:43.270 --> 10:45.306
I KNOW YOUR MOM
IS GONNA FIGHT

10:45.340 --> 10:47.228
TO BE OK FOR YOU GUYS.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.100
STEVE: NO, NO,
IT CAN'T BE RIGHT.

10:49.140 --> 10:50.277
THIS HAS TO BE A MISTAKE.

10:50.310 --> 10:52.244
HAVE THE LAB RUN IT AGAIN.

10:55.050 --> 10:57.348
RICK: GET OFF ME!
STOP--

10:57.390 --> 10:59.017
STOP. GET YOUR--

10:59.050 --> 11:01.086
MACK: COME ON.
COME ON, GET IN THERE!

11:01.120 --> 11:02.087
DAMN IT!

11:08.200 --> 11:10.395
HEY, THEY DID THIS.

11:10.430 --> 11:13.263
BROKE MY NOSE! OHH.

11:16.140 --> 11:18.836
HA HA HA, OH, YEAH.

11:18.870 --> 11:22.306
I WANTED TO DANCE,
THAT SIMPLE.

11:22.340 --> 11:24.444
IT'S NOT LIKE
IT'S AN ISSUE.

11:24.480 --> 11:27.449
LOOK AT ME.
SHE WANTED IT.

11:29.050 --> 11:31.985
SHE WANTED THAT?

11:32.020 --> 11:33.851
WHO
WANTS THAT?

11:33.890 --> 11:36.051
I DID NOT DO THAT.

11:36.090 --> 11:37.352
WELL, EVERYONE HERE
THINKS YOU DID.

11:37.390 --> 11:38.823
AND THAT'S A PROBLEM
FOR YOU

11:38.860 --> 11:41.420
BECAUSE THIS
IS THE CHIEF'S WIFE.

11:41.460 --> 11:44.258
AND YOU'RE
IN HIS HOUSE NOW.

11:44.300 --> 11:46.393
BAD FOR YOU,
GOOD FOR ME,

11:46.430 --> 11:47.863
BECAUSE THE LONGER
YOU SIT HERE,

11:47.900 --> 11:49.800
THE MORE TIME I HAVE
TO BUILD YOUR CASE.

11:49.840 --> 11:51.728
W-WAIT. WAIT!

11:51.770 --> 11:53.431
DON'T LEAVE ME!
YOU CAN'T LEAVE ME IN HERE!

11:53.480 --> 11:55.835
YOU HEAR STURGESS
IS IN CUSTODY?

11:55.880 --> 11:57.507
NOT THE BRIGHTEST GUY
IN THE WORLD.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.745
YEAH, THAT'S
WHAT I THOUGHT,

11:59.780 --> 12:01.441
UNTIL I SAW
THIS CRIME SCENE.

12:05.220 --> 12:06.414
CONSIDERING
THE HEAD WOUND.

12:06.450 --> 12:08.054
CLEANING UP
TAKES PATIENCE.

12:08.090 --> 12:09.785
STU RGESS IS IM PU LSIVE.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.252
WHAT ABOUT THE GRAVESITE?

12:11.290 --> 12:13.053
WELL, IT'S A HIKE
FROM THE PARKING LOT.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.921
WHOEVER DID THIS DRAGGED HER
MOST OF THE WAY OUT HERE.

12:15.960 --> 12:18.121
IF THEY'D HAD MORE TIME,
THEY'D HAVE DUG
FURTHER FROM THE TRAIL.

12:18.170 --> 12:20.536
THEY EVEN LEFT A SHOVEL
OUT HERE, AS IF
THEY WERE SCARED OFF.

12:20.570 --> 12:22.765
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

12:22.810 --> 12:25.836
ORGANIZED ENOUGH TO WEAR
GLOVES AND CLEAN UP,

12:25.870 --> 12:29.533
BUT FRENZIED ENOUGH
TO WANT TO BURY HER ALIVE.

12:29.580 --> 12:31.400
YEAH, I DON'T THINK
STURGESS IS OUR GUY.

12:31.450 --> 12:35.409
LEWIS: PRENTISS HAD ME CALL
A CONTACT IN ASHBURN
AND IT IS NOT GOOD.

12:35.450 --> 12:37.384
TRISH HAD MULTIPLE VISITS
TO THE E.R.

12:37.420 --> 12:40.184
BROKEN ARM, FRACTURED RIBS,
TWO MISCARRIAGES.

12:40.220 --> 12:42.279
OK. AND MULTIPLE
E.R. VISITS

12:42.320 --> 12:43.548
USUALLY MEANS FAMILY SERVICES.

12:43.590 --> 12:46.423
YEAH. TRISH SAID
SHE FELL DOWN THE STAIRS.

12:46.460 --> 12:47.495
LEWIS: SHE WASN'T PUSHED?

12:47.530 --> 12:48.849
NOT ACCORDING TO HER.

12:48.900 --> 12:51.960
NO E.R. VISITS SINCE
THEY MOVED TO HITCHENS.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.491
OH, THIS CASE JUST WENT
FROM A SLAM DUNK TO--

12:54.540 --> 12:56.189
I DON'T KNOW
THE RIGHT ANALOGY,

12:56.240 --> 12:58.458
BUT IT JUST GOT A WHOLE
LOT WORSE. CHECK THAT OUT.

12:58.510 --> 13:01.104
JJ, I'M ADDING DAVE AND MATT.
YOU'RE ON SPEAKER.

13:01.140 --> 13:02.846
WE'RE ALL HERE, JJ.

13:02.880 --> 13:05.178
OH, THANKS, TREVOR.

13:05.210 --> 13:07.349
YEAH. YEAH, I'M HERE, BUT...

13:07.380 --> 13:09.041
PRENTISS: UH, SOUNDS LIKE
YOU CAN'T TALK.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.310
OK, WE'VE RULED OUT
RICK STURGESS

13:11.350 --> 13:12.385
AS OUR PRIME SUSPECT.

13:12.420 --> 13:14.081
THERE WAS NO SEXUAL
ASSAULT ON TRISH.

13:14.120 --> 13:15.417
AS WE KNOW, STURGESS IS
ALL ABOUT THE PREDATORY

13:15.460 --> 13:17.155
MASCULINE BEHAVIOR.

13:17.190 --> 13:18.885
HE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO CONTROL THOSE URGES.

13:18.930 --> 13:21.091
SO DO WE HAVE
ANY OTHER SUSPECT S?

13:21.130 --> 13:24.190
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT TRISH'S
HUSBAND MIGHT BE INVOLVED.

13:24.230 --> 13:25.527
WHERE IS THAT
COMING FROM?

13:25.570 --> 13:28.391
BARB, TRISH'S FRIEND,
SHE SAID STEVE

13:28.440 --> 13:30.863
WAS TEXTING TRISH
ALL NIGHT.

13:30.910 --> 13:33.174
GARCIA: 42 TIMES
TO BE EXACT.

13:33.210 --> 13:35.428
STEVE WON'T RELEASE
THE MEDICAL RECORDS TO US,

13:35.480 --> 13:37.243
AND MACK TOLD ME LAST
NIGHT WAS THE FIRST TIME

13:37.280 --> 13:39.248
STEVE HAD EVER LEFT
TRISH ALONE.

13:39.280 --> 13:40.577
GARCIA: WHICH IS WEIRD
AND POSSESSIVE, RIGHT?

13:40.620 --> 13:42.144
SO I DID SOME DIGGING.

13:42.180 --> 13:44.444
TRISH HAS HAD A SLEW
OF, QUOTE, "ACCIDENTS."

13:44.490 --> 13:45.912
I DON'T WANT TO JUDGE,

13:45.950 --> 13:48.180
BUT THEY'RE CLASSIC EXCUSES
FOR DOMESTIC ABUSE.

13:48.220 --> 13:50.484
OK. BUT THE CHIEF
HAS A SOLID ALIBI.

13:50.530 --> 13:51.883
HE WAS CAMPING.

13:51.930 --> 13:53.852
AH, NOT SO SOLID.

13:53.900 --> 13:56.323
THEIR SON SAID WHEN THEY
WOKE UP AROUND 6 A.M.,

13:56.360 --> 13:57.463
STEVE WASN'T THERE.

13:57.500 --> 14:00.367
HE GOT BACK AROUND 7 AM.
WITH DOUGHNUTS,

14:00.400 --> 14:03.506
AND THAT IS WHEN MACK
CALLED WITH THE NEWS.

14:03.540 --> 14:05.235
SO, HE DRIVES HOME

14:05.270 --> 14:06.498
WHILE THE KIDS ARE ASLEEP,

14:06.540 --> 14:07.609
THINGS GET HEATED,

14:07.640 --> 14:11.599
HE GOES TOO FAR,
HAS TO COVER IT UP.

14:11.650 --> 14:13.379
YEAH, BUT TO DO
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER,

14:13.420 --> 14:15.877
THE LEVEL OF IT, HE'D
HAVE TO BE OUT OF HIS MIND.

14:15.920 --> 14:18.013
WELL, THE E.R. VISITS
COULD BE WHY THEY MOVED.

14:18.050 --> 14:20.382
YOU KNOW, TOO MANY PEOPLE
ASKING TOO MANY QUESTIONS.

14:20.420 --> 14:22.456
THEY NEEDED A FRESH START
IN A SMALL TOWN.

14:22.490 --> 14:23.889
OK, SO WHAT'S THE PLAN?

14:23.930 --> 14:24.954
YOU'RE IN A PUBLIC PLACE,

14:24.990 --> 14:26.457
SO HE WILL CONTROL
HIS TEMPER,

14:26.490 --> 14:27.627
AND HE WON'T BE
EXPECTING YOU TO ASK

14:27.660 --> 14:29.525
HOW THINGS HAVE BEEN
WITH HIM AND TRISH.

14:29.560 --> 14:31.369
YOU'LL GET
AN HONEST REACTION.

14:31.400 --> 14:34.892
OK. ALL RIGHT.
I'LL, UH, CALL YOU BACK.

14:43.680 --> 14:46.399
YOU THINK THAT I WOULD
TRY AND KILL MY WIFE?!

14:46.450 --> 14:48.475
WHY DID SHE END UP
IN THE E.R. SO MANY TIMES?

14:48.520 --> 14:52.012
TRISH IS ACCIDENT PRONE.

14:52.050 --> 14:55.213
BROKEN RIBS, BROKEN ARMS,

14:55.260 --> 14:57.649
MISCARRIAGES.
THAT'S A LOT OF ACCIDENTS.

14:57.690 --> 15:00.158
SHE HAVE A DRINKING PROBLEM?

15:00.200 --> 15:02.293
IS IT DRUGS?

15:02.330 --> 15:06.221
NO. NO DRUGS, NO ALCOHOL,
NOTHING LIKE THAT.

15:06.270 --> 15:07.931
WELL, YOU GOTTA GIVE ME
SOMETHING HERE

15:07.970 --> 15:09.096
TO MAKE ME BELIEVE THAT
YOU DIDN'T DO THIS,

15:09.140 --> 15:12.667
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW,
I THINK YOU DID.

15:12.710 --> 15:15.577
I GAVE UP
EVERYTHING I WANTED

15:15.610 --> 15:20.172
AND MOVED HERE
TO MAKE MY WIFE HAPPY.

15:20.220 --> 15:21.369
WHEN WE BOTH SAW
THAT HOUSE,

15:21.420 --> 15:23.081
WE THOUGHT WE'D FOUND
THE PERFECT HOME

15:23.120 --> 15:26.988
IN THE PERFECT TOWN,
AND NOW THIS.

15:27.020 --> 15:29.352
YOU TEXTED HER 42 TIMES

15:29.390 --> 15:31.187
WHEN SHE WAS
OUT WITH FRIENDS.

15:31.230 --> 15:33.152
THAT'S A LITTLE OBSESSIVE,
DON'T YOU THINK?

15:33.200 --> 15:35.293
I'M A COP,
A CONTROL FREAK.

15:35.330 --> 15:37.491
I DIDN'T KNOW
SHE WENT OUT.

15:37.530 --> 15:39.168
THAT MAKE YOU ANGRY?

15:39.200 --> 15:41.634
IT MADE ME WORRIED.

15:41.670 --> 15:44.537
TRISH NEVER GOES OUT.
WHEN SHE DIDN'T TEXT BACK,

15:44.570 --> 15:46.128
I THOUGHT ABOUT
DRIVING HOME,

15:46.170 --> 15:47.637
BUT I DIDN'T WANT
TO WAKE THE KIDS.

15:47.680 --> 15:48.999
BUT YOU LEFT THEM THERE.

15:49.040 --> 15:51.600
I HAD BREAKFAST DUTY.

15:51.650 --> 15:54.175
I THOUGHT EVERYBODY
WOULD LIKE DOUGHNUTS.

15:54.220 --> 15:56.438
I WAS GONE AN HOUR.

15:57.520 --> 16:00.159
LOOK, IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING

16:00.190 --> 16:02.283
THAT COULD HELP
SOLVE THIS CASE,

16:02.320 --> 16:04.629
YOU NEED TO TELL ME.

16:04.660 --> 16:08.118
HERE'S WHAT I KNOW.

16:08.160 --> 16:10.264
SOMEONE
IS TRYING TO FRAME ME

16:10.300 --> 16:12.689
FOR THE ATTEMPTED
MURDER OF MY WIFE.

16:12.730 --> 16:14.766
AND WHOEVER DID THIS
KNEW I WASN'T HOME,

16:14.800 --> 16:18.236
AND THAT LIST IS
AS SMALL AS THIS TOWN.

16:18.270 --> 16:21.000
SO, YEAH, I GET IT.
I GET IT.

16:21.040 --> 16:23.270
IT LOOKS PERSONAL.
DO I LOOK GOOD FOR IT?

16:23.310 --> 16:24.470
WITHOUT QUESTION.

16:24.510 --> 16:27.240
BUT WOULD I DO THAT
TO HER? NEVER.

16:27.280 --> 16:30.249
DADDY.

16:35.620 --> 16:37.258
YOU ARE

16:37.290 --> 16:39.429
THE ONLY PERSON
WHO HAS THE POWER

16:39.460 --> 16:43.464
AND THE RESOURCES
TO SOLVE THIS.

16:43.500 --> 16:48.199
SO I'M ASKING YOU,
FOR MY FAMILY...

16:48.240 --> 16:49.696
PLEASE HELP US.

16:51.370 --> 16:52.701
KIDS, COME ON.

16:52.740 --> 16:55.004
COME ON.

17:02.450 --> 17:03.417
HOW'D IT GO?

17:03.450 --> 17:04.439
JJ: HE'S HIDING
SOMETHING.

17:04.490 --> 17:05.741
LIKE TRYING
TO KILL HIS WIFE?

17:05.790 --> 17:08.350
NO, HE'S PROTECTING HER
AND HIS FAMILY.

17:08.390 --> 17:10.255
HE'S ANGRY,
RIGHTFULLY SO.

17:10.290 --> 17:12.281
THEN HE SHOULD GIVE US
EVERYTHING HE KNOWS

17:12.330 --> 17:13.695
TO HELP US FIND
WHO HURT HIS WIFE.

17:13.730 --> 17:15.459
UNLESS HE'S PLAYING IT
CLOSE TO THE VEST

17:15.500 --> 17:17.195
'CAUSE HE'S AFRAID
WHATEVER HE KNOWS
IS GONNA HURT HIS FAMILY.

17:17.230 --> 17:19.391
THERE'S THE USUAL SUSPECT S
THAT RAISE EYEBROWS--

17:19.430 --> 17:21.762
SEX, DRUGS, ROCK 'N' ROLL.
ANY OF THOSE FIT?

17:21.800 --> 17:22.869
JJ: I DON'T THINK SO.

17:22.900 --> 17:27.200
BUT HE OVERSOLD THE DENIAL
OF ALCOHOL AND DRUGS, SO...

17:27.240 --> 17:28.275
TOX SCREEN?

17:28.310 --> 17:29.504
JJ: WE'D HAVE TO SUBPOENA IT.

17:29.540 --> 17:31.269
WELL, IF IT ISN'T DRUGS,
IT COULD BE SEX.

17:31.310 --> 17:32.379
MAYBE SHE WAS HAVING
AND AFFAIR

17:32.410 --> 17:33.308
AND TRIED TO CALL IT OFF.

17:33.350 --> 17:34.612
OR SOMEONE COVETS HER.

17:34.650 --> 17:36.208
IF THEY CAN'T HAVE HER,
NO ONE CAN.

17:36.250 --> 17:37.547
ROSSI: GOSSIP FLIES THROUGH
A TOWN LIKE THIS.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.319
I'M SURE WE CAN ASK MACK.

17:39.350 --> 17:40.248
THERE COULD BE COLLUSION.

17:40.290 --> 17:42.758
WE NEED TO KEEP
OUR DEDUCTIONS TO OURSELVES.

17:42.790 --> 17:44.781
UH, MACK IS HERE.

17:44.830 --> 17:46.479
OK. CALL US BACK.

17:46.530 --> 17:48.589
DID MACK TELL YOU
HE WAS HEADED
TO THE HOSPITAL?

17:48.630 --> 17:49.824
NO.

17:49.860 --> 17:51.293
OH. INTERESTING
THAT HE WOULD DISAPPEAR

17:51.330 --> 17:53.332
DURING AN ACTIVE
INVESTIGATION.

17:53.370 --> 17:55.167
MACK DROVE TRISH HOME,

17:55.200 --> 17:57.202
AND HE WAS ONE OF
THE FIRST RESPONDERS.

17:57.240 --> 18:00.539
EVERY REPORT WE'VE READ
HAS GONE THROUGH HIS FILTER.

18:00.580 --> 18:01.877
WE NEED TO START OVER AGAIN,

18:01.910 --> 18:04.378
BRING THE WITNESSES
AND THE HIKERS BACK IN.

18:04.410 --> 18:06.605
YOU'RE PROBABLY USED TO
THIS KIND OF THING,

18:06.650 --> 18:10.347
BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN
SOMEONE IN A COMA.

18:10.390 --> 18:11.880
IS SHE CRYING?

18:11.920 --> 18:13.387
INVOLUNTARY
SIDE EFFECT?

18:13.420 --> 18:17.254
NOT UNLESS SHE CAN HEAR
EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON.

18:21.430 --> 18:24.365
EXCUSE ME.

18:24.400 --> 18:26.459
HEY.

18:26.500 --> 18:27.865
LEWIS: EMILY ASKED US
TO LOOK INTO MACK.

18:27.900 --> 18:29.265
HE STILL WITH YOU?

18:29.300 --> 18:30.232
YEAH.

18:30.270 --> 18:33.171
GARCIA: OK, SO MACK
WAS PASSED OVER AS CHIEF,

18:33.210 --> 18:34.438
DESPITE LIVING HIS WHOLE
LIFE IN HITCHENS

18:34.480 --> 18:35.833
AND BEING PRIMED
FOR PROMOTION.

18:35.880 --> 18:37.541
STEVE GAINES SWOOPED IN,
AND HE TOOK IT.

18:37.580 --> 18:39.309
SO YOU'RE THINKING JEALOUSY.

18:39.350 --> 18:41.375
ALVEZ: I MEAN, HE COULD
COVET STEVE'S CAREER,

18:41.420 --> 18:42.512
WIFE, FAMILY.

18:42.550 --> 18:44.142
YOU SEEING
ANY SIGNS OF THAT?

18:44.190 --> 18:46.909
I'M THINKING
EMOTIONAL GUILT.

18:46.950 --> 18:49.748
HOLD ON.

18:49.790 --> 18:51.189
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

18:51.230 --> 18:52.549
YOU, TOO.

18:52.590 --> 18:54.399
HEY. TAKE CARE, OK?

18:54.430 --> 18:56.421
ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING
TO LET EMILY KNOW
THAT HE LEFT.

18:56.460 --> 18:58.269
COPY. YOU BE SAFE.

18:58.300 --> 19:00.268
BYE.

19:00.300 --> 19:02.632
SO WE KNOW MACK'S CRUISER
WAS AT THE GAINES HOUSE

19:02.670 --> 19:04.558
AND THE BURIAL SITE.

19:04.610 --> 19:06.464
THERE'S ANOTHER VEHICLE.
IT'S NOT IN HIS REPORTS.

19:06.510 --> 19:10.401
THESE TREADS LOOK LIKE
THEY'RE FROM A PICKUP,

19:10.450 --> 19:13.271
WHICH HAPPENS TO BE
MACK'S OFF-DUTY VEHICLE.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.379
IT LOOKS LIKE
THE HIKERS ARE HERE.

19:15.420 --> 19:19.242
WANT TO SEE WHAT
THEY KNOW ABOUT MACK?

19:19.290 --> 19:21.212
MACK: YOU'VE GOTTA
COME CLEAN WITH ME.

19:21.260 --> 19:22.909
OF COURSE I DON'T THINK
YOU DID THIS,

19:22.960 --> 19:24.882
BUT MAYBE YOU KNOW WHO DID,
AND THE FBI IS HERE.

19:24.930 --> 19:26.750
THERE'S NO CHOICE ANYMORE, OK?

19:26.790 --> 19:28.599
MEET ME AT CEDAR BRIDGE.

19:28.630 --> 19:31.599
IT'S JUST ME.
I'LL FILL THEM IN AFTER.

19:33.500 --> 19:36.264
YOU SAID YOU'D NEVER
HIKED THAT TRAIL BEFORE.
WHY IS THAT?

19:36.300 --> 19:38.860
COYOTES ATTACK DOGS
OUT THAT WAY.

19:38.910 --> 19:41.231
SO YOUR DOG
FOUND THE GRAVE.

19:41.280 --> 19:43.248
WELL, THE BARKING
GOT OUR ATTENTION,

19:43.280 --> 19:45.339
BUT THE OTHER WOMAN
FOUND IT.

19:45.380 --> 19:46.745
WHAT WOMAN?

19:46.780 --> 19:50.238
I DON'T KNOW WHO SHE IS,
BUT MACK KNEW HER.

19:50.290 --> 19:52.349
WAS HE SURPRISED
TO SEE HER?

19:52.390 --> 19:53.812
I THINK SO.

20:01.030 --> 20:02.850
WHO THE HELL
IS THIS WOMAN,

20:02.900 --> 20:06.529
AND WHY HASN'T MACK
TOLD US ABOUT HER?

20:26.490 --> 20:27.809
UNH!

20:27.860 --> 20:29.384
OHH!

20:33.730 --> 20:35.493
OHH...

20:45.510 --> 20:47.637
NO...

20:47.680 --> 20:50.399
NO! NO! NO!

20:59.920 --> 21:01.888
FIRST THEY TRY TO KILL
THE CHIEF'S WIFE,

21:01.920 --> 21:03.854
NOW THEY TAKE OUT
HIS SECOND IN COMMAND?

21:03.890 --> 21:05.881
WHAT'D GAINES DO
TO PISS OFF THE UNSUB?

21:05.930 --> 21:06.555
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT IT FEELS LIKE

21:06.590 --> 21:08.057
WE WALKED INTO
A TOWN AT WAR.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.692
SO STAY LOCKED AND LOADED.

21:09.730 --> 21:11.561
NOW THAT THEY KILLED
A COP, ALL BETS ARE OFF.

21:11.600 --> 21:14.797
WE GOT AN EMBOLDENED
SERIAL OFFENDER
AND NO SUSPECTS.

21:14.840 --> 21:16.068
THERE'S ONE.
THERE'S A FEMALE HIKER

21:16.100 --> 21:18.568
THAT MACK SAW
AT THE BURIAL SITE.

21:18.610 --> 21:20.066
YOU STILL THINK
MACK'S INVOLVED?

21:20.110 --> 21:22.533
I DON'T. BUT I THINK
HE HAD A LEAD,

21:22.580 --> 21:26.744
AND IF HE'D FILLED US IN,
HE MIGHT STILL BE ALIVE.

21:26.780 --> 21:28.008
HE TOOK ONE IN
THE KEVLAR,

21:28.050 --> 21:30.848
THE OTHER ONE
THERE IN THE GUT,

21:30.890 --> 21:31.788
BUT THAT'S NOT
WHAT KILLED HIM.

21:31.820 --> 21:34.482
HE'S GOT PETECHIAE
HEMORRHAGING IN HIS EYES.

21:34.520 --> 21:38.081
HE WAS ASPHYXIATED.
KILLER MADE SURE HE WAS DEAD.

21:38.130 --> 21:41.099
THEY LEARNED FROM THE MISTAKE
THEY HAD WITH TRISH.

21:41.130 --> 21:42.529
OFFICER: HERE'S MACK'S
STUFF, AGENT.

21:42.560 --> 21:44.869
THANKS.
LET'S GET THESE TO GARCIA.

21:44.900 --> 21:45.889
THERE MIGHT BE A CLUE.

21:45.930 --> 21:47.932
THE SAME KIND OF TRUCK TREADS
ARE ALSO OVER THERE.

21:47.970 --> 21:49.164
IT'S GOTTA BE THE UNSUB'S.

21:49.200 --> 21:51.839
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE THEY LURED
MACK OUT HERE TO FINISH HIM OFF.

21:51.870 --> 21:55.579
JUST LIKE THE BURIAL,
THIS KILL FEELS
IMPROVISED.

21:55.610 --> 21:57.771
FU LL-TILT BOOGIE.

21:57.810 --> 22:00.643
IT'S COP SLANG.
IT'S WHEN YOU'RE RIDING

22:00.680 --> 22:02.375
THE ADRENALINE OF A MURDER
AND YOU HAVEN'T PLANNED

22:02.420 --> 22:05.583
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO NEXT.
YOU TEND TO GET RECKLESS.

22:05.620 --> 22:08.487
LEARN SOMETHING
NEW EVERY DAY.

22:10.860 --> 22:13.954
HEY. LOOK WHO I FOUND.

22:14.000 --> 22:14.921
SPENCE.

22:14.960 --> 22:16.825
GOOD TO HAVE
YOU BACK.

22:16.860 --> 22:18.794
IT'S GOOD
TO BE BACK.

22:18.830 --> 22:22.630
WHAT'S THEIR STORY?

22:22.670 --> 22:23.637
IT'S OVER.

22:23.670 --> 22:26.400
HE O.D.ed.

22:26.440 --> 22:28.931
NINTH ONE
THIS WEEK.

22:28.980 --> 22:31.801
TRISH'S BODY TEMPERATURE
IS NORMAL,

22:31.850 --> 22:34.876
BUT SHE DOESN'T
SEEM STABLE.

22:44.760 --> 22:47.991
SHE'S SHAKING AND SWEATING.

22:48.030 --> 22:50.157
YEAH.

22:50.200 --> 22:53.636
HEY, UM, TRISH LOOKS LIKE
SHE'S GOING THROUGH WITHDRAWAL.

22:53.670 --> 22:57.766
MY GUESS IS OPIATES
OR SOME OTHER KIND
OF PRESCRIPTION MEDS.

22:57.810 --> 22:59.869
THAT'S A BIG
ACCUSATION.

22:59.910 --> 23:01.878
WHEN I ASKED STEVE ABOUT
THE ALCOHOL AND DRUGS,

23:01.910 --> 23:04.003
HE VEHEMENTLY DENIED IT.

23:04.050 --> 23:05.972
IF SHE'S ADDICTED,
HER BODY'S BUILT UP
A TOLERANCE.

23:06.010 --> 23:07.773
WHATEVER SHE'S GETTING
IN HERE IS ONLY PROVIDING

23:07.820 --> 23:09.139
A FRACTION OF WHAT
OF WHAT SHE NEEDS.

23:09.180 --> 23:11.410
SO SHE'S DETOXING
WHILE IN A COMA?

23:11.450 --> 23:13.987
YEAH. LOOK, WE NEED TO
FIND OUT WHAT KIND OF DRUGS,

23:14.020 --> 23:15.089
BECAUSE THIS COULD
HAVE SOMETHING TO DO

23:15.120 --> 23:16.610
WITH WHY SHE
WAS ATTACKED.

23:16.660 --> 23:18.184
LET ME GUESS. THE DOCTOR'S
BEEN LESS THAN FORTHCOMING.

23:18.230 --> 23:21.028
OH, YEAH. EVERYBODY'S
KEEPING SECRETS.

23:21.060 --> 23:23.426
WELL, IF IT'S WIDESPREAD
IN A COMMUNITY LIKE THIS,

23:23.470 --> 23:26.189
EVERYONE'S EITHER USING,
ENABLING, OR IN DENIAL.

23:26.230 --> 23:29.631
THEN IT'S TIME
WE PROFILE THE TOWN.

23:32.040 --> 23:35.532
SO WE JUST GOT THE EMTs
TO ADMIT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN

23:35.580 --> 23:38.469
15 DEATHS, 102 OVERDOSES,

23:38.510 --> 23:40.740
9 BABIES BORN WITH
DRUG-RELATED ISSUES

23:40.780 --> 23:42.509
IN THIS COUNTY
IN THE LAST WEEK.

23:42.550 --> 23:46.111
I'VE GOT 306 JAILED
JUST THIS MONTH FOR DRUGS.

23:46.150 --> 23:47.879
THE EMTs TOLD US THEY'VE GONE
TO A SINGLE HOUSE

23:47.920 --> 23:50.582
MULTIPLE TIMES IN ONE DAY
DUE TO OVERDOSES.

23:50.630 --> 23:52.848
SO WHY IS THIS TOWN
HIT SO HARD?

23:52.890 --> 23:54.027
BALTIMORE'S THE CLOSEST
PORT CITY.

23:54.060 --> 23:57.120
HITCHENS COUNTY IS MERELY A STOP
ALONG THIS HEROIN HIGHWAY.

23:58.800 --> 24:00.461
GOOD DAY AND NEWS.

24:00.500 --> 24:02.889
UM, I GOT INTO MACK'S
SMASHED CELL PHONE.

24:02.940 --> 24:04.202
NOT A LOT OF ACTIVITY.

24:04.240 --> 24:07.129
THERE IS A OUTGOING CALL
TO A PAY PHONE IN TOWN.

24:07.170 --> 24:09.502
AND I HAVE THE LAST ENTRY
IN HIS NOTES.

24:09.540 --> 24:10.746
GREAT. LET'S HAVE IT.

24:10.780 --> 24:12.668
"SHELLY."
THOSE WERE HIS NOTES.

24:12.710 --> 24:13.972
THAT WAS HIS NOTE--THAT NAME.

24:14.020 --> 24:15.669
HAS THERE BEEN A SHELLY
ANYWHERE ELSE

24:15.720 --> 24:16.971
IN THE INVESTIGATION?

24:17.020 --> 24:19.113
SHE WASN'T ON
THE WITNESS LIST
FROM THE BAR.

24:19.150 --> 24:22.984
GARCIA, HOW MANY
SHELLYS IN THE COUNTY
DRIVE A PICKUP?

24:23.020 --> 24:23.827
NOT A SINGLE ONE.

24:23.860 --> 24:26.920
OK, KEEP TRYING.
IT COULD BE A NICKNAME

24:26.960 --> 24:29.155
OR A LAST NAME
CONNECTED TO TRISH.

24:29.200 --> 24:30.997
GARCIA: ALL BASES COVERED.
GOT IT.

24:31.030 --> 24:32.099
TRISH WAS SURROUNDED
BY A LOT OF WOMEN

24:32.130 --> 24:34.030
THE NIGHT SHE WAS ATTACKED.

24:34.070 --> 24:36.095
SO MAYBE THIS SHELLY
WAS INVOLVED,

24:36.140 --> 24:37.539
BUT SHE JUST DIDN'T
COME FORWARD.

24:37.570 --> 24:41.028
WHAT IF SHE'S
TRISH'S DEALER?

24:41.080 --> 24:44.607
WE NEED TO TALK
TO THE CHIEF.

24:46.680 --> 24:48.739
GENTLEM EN.
COME ON IN.

24:48.780 --> 24:50.816
THANK YOU.

24:53.250 --> 24:57.528
HEY, TREV. DO ME A SOLID.
GO WORK IN YOUR ROOM.

24:57.560 --> 25:00.859
IF THAT MATH STARTS TO BITE,
JUST GIVE A HOLLER.

25:04.770 --> 25:06.988
WE'RE SORRY ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED WITH TRISH.

25:07.030 --> 25:08.588
THANK YOU.

25:08.640 --> 25:11.006
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT MACK'S DEAD.

25:11.040 --> 25:13.702
HE WAS SUCH A GOOD MAN.

25:13.740 --> 25:18.040
MACK HAD SUSPICIONS
ABOUT SOMEONE NAMED SHELLY.

25:18.080 --> 25:21.117
NO, I DON'T KNOW
A SHELLY.

25:21.150 --> 25:23.118
OK, WELL, HERE'S THE DEAL.

25:23.150 --> 25:25.539
WE THINK YOU'RE
WITHHOLDING INFORMATION

25:25.590 --> 25:28.889
THAT WOULD HELP US SOLVE
WHO DID THAT TO TRISH.

25:28.920 --> 25:32.185
AND AGENT JAREAU
FEELS THAT YOUR WIFE

25:32.230 --> 25:36.121
IS SHOWING SIGNS
OF WITHDRAWAL.

25:36.160 --> 25:38.128
ADDICTION IS A DISEASE.

25:38.170 --> 25:40.126
IT'S NOT A MORAL FAILING.

25:40.170 --> 25:42.161
IT'S NOTHING
TO BE ASHAMED OF.

25:42.200 --> 25:44.862
BUT IF YOU'RE NOT BEING
HONEST WITH US RIGHT HERE,

25:44.910 --> 25:47.799
THEN YOU'RE HINDERING
THE INVESTIGATION.

25:51.210 --> 25:55.340
MY WIFE HAS BEEN LOSING
A BATTLE WITH OXYCODONE

25:55.380 --> 25:57.143
SINCE SHE MISCARRIED
TWO YEARS AGO.

25:57.180 --> 26:00.240
AND THE DOCTOR JUST
KEPT PRESCRIBING PILLS.

26:00.290 --> 26:03.111
NO. HE STOPPED
WHEN SHE GOT ADDICTED.

26:03.160 --> 26:05.048
I WANTED HER
TO GO INTO REHAB,

26:05.090 --> 26:08.196
BUT SHE DIDN'T WANT
ANYONE ELSE TO KNOW.

26:08.230 --> 26:11.791
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
SHE'S STILL ON SOMETHING.

26:11.830 --> 26:15.994
SHE IS, BUT NOT
NEARLY AS MUCH.

26:16.040 --> 26:20.306
TRISH WAS TAKING
50 PILLS A DAY.

26:20.340 --> 26:21.739
SHE'S DOWN TO 10.

26:21.780 --> 26:24.248
AND I KNOW THAT STILL
SOUNDS LIKE A LOT,

26:24.280 --> 26:27.101
BUT GOING COLD TURKEY
IS DANGEROUS

26:27.150 --> 26:29.209
AND IT WASN'T GONNA WORK.

26:31.090 --> 26:33.718
AND WHERE
IS SHE GETTING THEM?

26:33.760 --> 26:36.957
I HAVE A SLIPPED DISK.

26:36.990 --> 26:40.380
AND I CAN MANAGE ON ASPIRIN.

26:40.430 --> 26:45.094
BUT THE DOCTORS ARE REALLY
INTO MANAGING PAIN,

26:45.130 --> 26:50.193
SO...I CAN GET
A PRESCRIPTION.

26:51.270 --> 26:53.932
I'M IN CHARGE
OF THE PILLS.

26:53.980 --> 26:55.379
SO IT'S MONITORED.

26:59.380 --> 27:02.110
NOW I STILL DON'T GET
WHAT TRISH'S ADDICTION

27:02.150 --> 27:04.038
HAS TO DO
WITH THE ATTACK.

27:04.090 --> 27:07.753
WE THINK IT'S SOMEONE
WHO FEARS THAT TRISH
IS GOING TO EXPOSE THEM.

27:07.790 --> 27:10.258
A...DOCTOR OR A DEALER.

27:10.290 --> 27:13.179
NO, THERE'S NO DEALER,
TRUST ME.

27:13.230 --> 27:15.255
YOU DO KNOW
YOU'RE ENABLING HER.

27:15.300 --> 27:18.189
YEAH. AND BECAUSE OF IT,

27:18.230 --> 27:20.994
I'VE GOTTEN TOO GOOD
AT KEEPING SECRETS.

27:22.870 --> 27:24.667
HI.

27:24.710 --> 27:25.961
HELLO.

27:26.010 --> 27:27.159
I'M SPENCER.

27:27.210 --> 27:28.677
I'M DANA.

27:28.710 --> 27:31.144
YOU WORK WITH JENNIFER
AND PENELOPE, RIGHT?

27:31.180 --> 27:33.375
YEAH. YOUR DAD TOLD
MY TEAM ABOUT--

27:33.410 --> 27:35.219
ABOUT MY MOM.

27:35.250 --> 27:37.718
YEAH. HE JUST CALLED.

27:37.750 --> 27:39.718
SO YOU CAME HERE
TO WATCH MY COMATOSE,

27:39.750 --> 27:41.251
STRUNG

27:43.060 --> 27:44.152
GOT IT.

27:44.190 --> 27:47.353
ACTUALLY, THE REASON I CAME
IS BECAUSE PENELOPE TOLD ME

27:47.390 --> 27:49.995
YOU WERE WORKING
ON A PROJECT FOR SCHOOL

27:50.030 --> 27:52.225
ABOUT THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS,
AND IT JUST SO HAPPENS

27:52.270 --> 27:53.999
THAT THE BOOK
I'M CURRENTLY READING

27:54.040 --> 27:56.964
IS ABOUT THE WILDLIFE THERE.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.308
IT'S NOT FOR SCHOOL.

27:58.340 --> 28:01.400
I JUST SAID THAT BECAUSE
IT SOUNDED A LOT LESS WEIRD

28:01.440 --> 28:03.977
THAN I WAS LEARNING ABOUT IT
JUST 'CAUSE I WANTED TO.

28:04.010 --> 28:06.149
I LEARN ABOUT THINGS
ALL THE TIME
JUST BECAUSE I WANT TO.

28:06.180 --> 28:08.148
RECENTLY I'VE BEEN
STUDYING UP ON FUNGI

28:08.180 --> 28:11.115
FOR NO OTHER REASON
THAN I LOVE YEASTS
AND MOLDS.

28:11.150 --> 28:14.187
I THINK IT'S, UH--
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE
I CAN RELATE TO THEM.

28:14.220 --> 28:16.154
YOU RELATE TO MOLD?

28:16.190 --> 28:20.229
WELL, I--I LEARNED
THAT FUNGUS IS MOBILE,

28:20.260 --> 28:22.455
BUT IT'S ONLY MOBILE
BECAUSE IT GROWS.

28:22.500 --> 28:26.322
AND I KNOW WITH MYSELF
THAT MY LIFE
SEEMS TO GET BETTER

28:26.370 --> 28:30.033
AND I FIND MYSELF MOVING
INTO NEW THINGS AS I GROW.

28:30.070 --> 28:32.163
WHICH KIND OF
MAKES ME WONDER

28:32.210 --> 28:34.872
IF MAYBE YOU'RE READING
ABOUT THE GALAPAGOS

28:34.910 --> 28:39.301
'CAUSE YOU CAN RELATE
TO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.

28:39.350 --> 28:42.217
IT'S A BUNCH
OF WEIRD ISLANDS.

28:42.250 --> 28:45.811
I DO FEEL LIKE
A WEIRD ISLAND.

28:49.120 --> 28:52.920
HAVING TROUBLE
SORTING OUT YOUR
FEELINGS WITH YOUR MOM?

28:54.530 --> 28:57.192
LOOK, I KNOW ALL THE STATS,

28:57.230 --> 29:00.267
AND I KNOW HOW THERE'S
A HUGE DRUG PROBLEM IN THE U.S.,

29:00.300 --> 29:05.260
BUT...IT'S JUST SO DIFFERENT
WHEN IT'S MY MOM.

29:05.310 --> 29:08.131
I KNOW SHE'S BEEN
TAKING THOSE PILLS

29:08.180 --> 29:11.877
AND CALLING HELP LINES,
WHATEVER.

29:11.910 --> 29:15.471
I'M STILL JUST
SO ANGRY AT HER.

29:18.420 --> 29:21.878
I HAVEN'T TOLD MY MOM
I LOVED HER IN OVER A YEAR.

29:24.130 --> 29:27.258
I CAN'T.

29:27.290 --> 29:31.226
I DO LOVE HER.

29:31.270 --> 29:34.467
IT'S FUNNY THAT
THE VERY THING

29:34.500 --> 29:36.161
THAT'S HELPING
YOUR MOM GET CLEAN

29:36.200 --> 29:40.307
MIGHT ACTUALLY BE
YOUR ANGER.

29:40.340 --> 29:42.535
THERE ARE STUDIES
RECENTLY THAT SHOW

29:42.580 --> 29:45.071
THAT TRADITIONAL FORMS
OF CARE AND COMPASSION

29:45.110 --> 29:46.509
SOMETIMES DON'T OFFER
ENOUGH INCENTIVE

29:46.550 --> 29:49.212
TO THE PERSON
WITH THE ADDICTION.

29:50.450 --> 29:52.987
SO ME BEING A JERK
TO MY MOM

29:53.020 --> 29:54.317
HAS ACTUALLY BEEN GOOD?

29:54.360 --> 29:58.251
ARE YOU BEING A JERK
BECAUSE YOU LOVE HER?

29:58.290 --> 30:01.157
YEAH. IT'S GOOD.

30:05.300 --> 30:08.337
I JUST WISH
SHE WOULD WAKE UP.

30:12.410 --> 30:14.378
IF HITCHENS MIMICS
THE NATIONAL STATS,

30:14.410 --> 30:15.536
THERE'S AN OPIOID
ADDICTION

30:15.580 --> 30:18.003
IN ONE OUT OF EVERY
6 HOUSES.

30:18.050 --> 30:21.349
AND THAT NUMBER
HAS QUADRUPLED
IN THE LAST 20 YEARS.

30:21.380 --> 30:26.113
SO, I TALKED TO ALL
OF TRISH'S FRIENDS
FROM THE BAR THAT NIGHT,

30:26.150 --> 30:28.516
EXCEPT FOR KAT.
SHE HASN'T RETURNED ANY

30:28.560 --> 30:30.881
OF MY PHONE CALLS,
WHICH IS ESPECIALLY STRANGE

30:30.930 --> 30:34.354
BECAUSE I SAW HER TALKING
TO MACK YESTERDAY,

30:34.400 --> 30:37.551
AND I BET YOU SHE WASN'T
TELLING HIM EVERYTHING.

30:37.600 --> 30:39.465
MACK DIDN'T PUT MUCH
IN THE REPORT.

30:39.500 --> 30:42.060
WE SHOULD SEE IF SHE'S CONNECTED
TO ANYONE NAMED SHELLY.

30:42.100 --> 30:45.103
WELL, IT SAYS HERE
THAT KAT'S FROM BALTIMORE
ORIGINALLY,

30:45.140 --> 30:47.938
SO WHAT BROUGHT HER
TO HITCHENS?

31:21.080 --> 31:23.230
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE, KAT?

31:23.280 --> 31:24.508
I WANTED TO SEE HER.

31:24.550 --> 31:25.676
NO, NOT HERE.

31:25.710 --> 31:27.917
NOT NOW.
YOU'RE BEING STUPID.

31:27.950 --> 31:30.316
I'M FREAKED OUT, SHELLY.
THEY KEEP CALLING ME,

31:30.350 --> 31:33.183
WANT ME TO ANSWER QUESTIONS.

31:33.220 --> 31:35.609
WHAT IF THEY KNOW
WHAT YOU DID?

31:36.960 --> 31:40.088
YOU JUST HOLD THEM OFF.

31:41.360 --> 31:43.419
I'M GONNA COME BY
LATER, OK?

31:43.460 --> 31:44.529
MM-HMM.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.219
GET OUT OF HERE.

31:56.510 --> 32:00.139
THESE PILLS ARE THE MOST
PROLIFIC SERIAL KILLERS
WE'VE EVER SEEN.

32:00.180 --> 32:01.442
ALVEZ: LIKE A LOT OF TOWNS
IN AMERICA, I MEAN,

32:01.480 --> 32:04.119
HITCHENS COULD BE QUIETLY
CALLING OUT FOR HELP.

32:04.150 --> 32:06.539
LEWIS: JJ SAID
THERE'S A COMMUNITY
BOARD DOWN AT THE HOSPITAL

32:06.590 --> 32:09.150
AND ALMOST EVERY FLYER
IS FOR AN ADDICTION HOT LINE.

32:09.190 --> 32:11.181
WONDER WHO SPONSORS THOSE.

32:12.560 --> 32:15.358
GARCIA,
ARE YOUR EARS BURNING?

32:15.400 --> 32:18.494
MY EARS ARE THE SAME
TEMPERATURE AS THE REST
OF MY BODY--HOT.

32:18.530 --> 32:20.725
OH, THAT SOUNDS LIKE FLIRTING.
I DON'T FLIRT WITH YOU.

32:20.770 --> 32:22.533
IT'S IN MY MISSION STATEMENT.
WHAT DO YOU NEED?

32:22.570 --> 32:24.128
OK, LOOK, WE NEED TO KNOW

32:24.170 --> 32:26.400
WHO RUNS THE DRUG HELP LINES
IN HITCHENS.

32:26.440 --> 32:27.532
THAT WILL BE NEXT
ON MY TO-DO LIST.

32:27.570 --> 32:29.333
I CALLED YOU TO SAY
THAT THE CHIEF

32:29.380 --> 32:30.631
IS GETTING
HIS PRESCRIPTION FILLED

32:30.680 --> 32:34.218
BY A DR. GORMAN,
BUT IT'S ALL TOTALLY LEGIT.

32:34.250 --> 32:37.219
BY CHANCE, ANYBODY
IN HIS LIFE NAMED SHELLY?

32:37.250 --> 32:39.138
UH...

32:39.190 --> 32:40.339
HIS WIFE'S NAME'S MICHELLE.

32:40.390 --> 32:42.654
SHELLY COULD BE SHORT
FOR MICHELLE, RIGHT?

32:42.690 --> 32:44.453
JJ JUST WALKED IN
AND SHE LOOKS...

32:44.490 --> 32:45.684
WHAT'S WRONG?

32:45.730 --> 32:47.584
TRISH IS AWAKE.

32:53.070 --> 32:55.561
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
WHO DID THIS TO ME.

32:55.600 --> 32:58.103
YOU KNOW, I GOT HIT SO HARD,

32:58.140 --> 33:00.358
I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER
ANYTHING THAT MAKES ANY SENSE.

33:00.410 --> 33:03.174
DO YOU KNOW ANYONE
NAMED SHELLY?

33:03.210 --> 33:05.007
SHELLY.

33:08.220 --> 33:09.517
NO.

33:09.550 --> 33:11.211
WE KNOW ABOUT
YOUR ADDICTION

33:11.250 --> 33:13.548
AND THAT STEVE
GETS YOU PILLS
FROM DR. GORMAN.

33:13.590 --> 33:16.479
THAT'S RIGHT,
BUT I NEVER MET HIM.

33:16.520 --> 33:19.318
WHAT ABOUT HIS WIFE
MICHELLE?

33:19.360 --> 33:21.453
NO.

33:22.730 --> 33:25.221
I KEEP SEEING
STEVE AND THE KIDS

33:25.270 --> 33:28.091
AND THEY'RE STANDING OVER ME
WHEN I'M GETTING BURIED.

33:28.140 --> 33:29.493
AND I KNOW THEY'RE
NOT REALLY THERE

33:29.540 --> 33:31.201
AND I REALLY, REALLY
WANT THEM TO BE THERE.

33:31.240 --> 33:38.772
AND I KEEP TRYING TO SEE
WHO'S DOING THIS TO ME, AND...

33:38.810 --> 33:42.712
AND I CAN'T BECAUSE THERE'S
TOO MUCH DIRT IN MY EYES.

33:42.750 --> 33:46.117
AND THERE'S TWO OR THREE
PEOPLE.

33:46.150 --> 33:47.708
SOMEONE CALL 911!

33:47.750 --> 33:50.412
ONE OF THEM'S YELLING
FOR SOMEBODY TO GET ME HELP.

33:50.460 --> 33:51.688
AND THERE'S DOGS BARKING.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND

33:51.730 --> 33:53.686
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A DOG.

33:53.730 --> 33:59.293
AND I DON'T KNOW WHO SHE IS,
BECAUSE I KNOW HER...

33:59.330 --> 34:00.820
I CAN'T REMEMBER
HER NAME.

34:00.870 --> 34:02.633
DANA TOLD US THAT YOU
CALLED THE HELP LINE.

34:02.670 --> 34:05.833
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHO YOU TALKED TO?

34:05.870 --> 34:07.758
IT WAS ALWAYS A WOMAN.

34:07.810 --> 34:10.699
AND STEVE AND THE KIDS
HAD LEFT THAT DAY,

34:10.740 --> 34:13.243
AND I WAS WORRIED BECAUSE
I DIDN'T WANT TO RELAPSE.

34:13.280 --> 34:15.373
AND SO I CALLED AND I SAID
THAT I WAS ALONE

34:15.420 --> 34:17.342
AND I WAS REALLY SCARED.

34:17.380 --> 34:21.282
AND--AND WHEN
I TOLD HER THAT...

34:21.320 --> 34:23.083
STEVE WAS THE ONE
WHO GOT ME THE PILLS,

34:23.120 --> 34:25.327
SHE GOT REALLY MAD.

34:25.360 --> 34:28.818
AND I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND
WHY SHE GOT SO MAD.

34:28.860 --> 34:30.327
I TOLD HER THAT
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OK

34:30.360 --> 34:32.191
BECAUSE STEVE IS A COP.
AND SO--

34:32.230 --> 34:34.198
SORRY, AGENTS,
TRISH NEEDS SOME SLEEP.

34:34.240 --> 34:35.867
IT'S--IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.
HE'S TRYING TO HELP.

34:35.900 --> 34:37.390
HERE, HERE.

34:37.440 --> 34:39.431
OK. OK.

34:39.470 --> 34:40.801
REID: SHE UNKNOWINGLY
TOLD THE UNSUB

34:40.840 --> 34:42.478
SHE WAS ALONE
AND VULNERABLE.

34:42.510 --> 34:43.579
JJ: WHAT DO YOU GOT?

34:43.610 --> 34:44.679
SO, SO MUCH. OK, SO,

34:44.710 --> 34:46.200
THE HELP LINE
THAT TRISH CALLED,

34:46.250 --> 34:48.639
THAT WAS CALLED
THE FAIRHOPE CENTER HELPLINE.

34:48.680 --> 34:52.844
BUT THESE ARE 6 OTHER
HELP LINES IN THE AREA.

34:52.890 --> 34:54.778
EACH ONE OF THEM
SPENDS A HUNK OF MONEY

34:54.820 --> 34:56.151
ON THOSE SOCIAL MEDIA
ADS, THE ONES

34:56.190 --> 34:57.452
THAT LOOK LIKE
NEWS ARTICLES.

34:57.490 --> 34:58.855
WHAT THEY MAKE UP FOR
IN VISIBILITY,

34:58.890 --> 35:00.221
THEY LACK IN ACCREDITATION.

35:00.260 --> 35:02.524
ALL OF THEIR BOARD
OF DIRECTORS, THE DOCTORS,

35:02.560 --> 35:04.528
THEY SEEM IMAGINARY.
HERE IS THE KICKER.

35:04.570 --> 35:06.788
EACH ONE OF THESE,
THEY'RE OWNED
BY THE SAME PERSON,

35:06.830 --> 35:10.163
MICHELLE MACKREL,
AKA SHELLY MACKREL,

35:10.200 --> 35:11.337
DR. GORMAN'S WIFE.

35:11.370 --> 35:12.769
SO SH ELLY'S PARANOID.

35:12.810 --> 35:14.300
SHE WENT TO
EXTRAORDINARY LENGTHS

35:14.340 --> 35:16.308
TO KEEP TABS ON THE ADDICTS
AFTER THEY CALLED.

35:16.340 --> 35:18.444
IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE SOMEONE TRIGGERED HER.

35:18.480 --> 35:20.141
JJ: AND SHE FINALLY SNAPPED
WHEN TRISH CALLED.

35:20.180 --> 35:22.341
WHY WOULD SHELLY
WANT TO KILL TRISH?

35:22.380 --> 35:23.870
HER HUSBAND ISN'T
DOING ANYTHING.

35:23.920 --> 35:25.785
HE'S JUST PRESCRIBING
MEDICATION.

35:25.820 --> 35:27.481
IT'S TOTALLY NORMAL
DOCTOR STUFF.

35:27.520 --> 35:28.817
HE HAS NOTHING TO HIDE.

35:28.860 --> 35:30.612
WELL, THEN SHELLY MUST.

35:30.660 --> 35:31.854
I'M GUESSING
SHE'S DEALING ON THE SIDE.

35:31.890 --> 35:33.289
IF SHE'S WORRIED
ABOUT GOING TO JAIL,

35:33.330 --> 35:34.297
SHE'D MAKE SURE
THERE'S A PATSY.

35:34.330 --> 35:35.297
DOES SHE HAVE
A HISTORY OF THIS

35:35.330 --> 35:36.558
OR ANY FAMILY
IN THE AREA?

35:36.600 --> 35:37.828
OK. I JUST FOUND THIS OUT.

35:37.860 --> 35:39.418
I'LL CHECK INTO
HISTORY RIGHT NOW, AND...

35:39.470 --> 35:40.869
SMALL TOWN, SMALL WORLD.

35:40.900 --> 35:44.336
SHELLY HAS A SISTER.

35:44.370 --> 35:45.803
KAT MACKREL.

35:45.840 --> 35:47.831
THAT'S TRISH'S FRIEND.

35:51.380 --> 35:53.940
HOW WAS BALLET CLASS?
WAS IT GOOD?

35:53.980 --> 35:55.311
YEAH, IT WAS FUN.

35:55.350 --> 35:56.442
WELL, I'M WORKING
REALLY HARD

35:56.480 --> 35:57.777
TO FIND US
A NICE PLACE.

35:57.820 --> 35:59.412
OK, BUT I LIKE MY ROOM.

35:59.450 --> 36:01.213
I KNOW YOU DO, JUSTINE.

36:01.260 --> 36:02.887
BUT DON'T YOU WANT
SLEEPOVERS?

36:02.920 --> 36:04.387
YEAH.

36:04.430 --> 36:06.523
OK. SO I'M GONNA
FIND A WAY
FOR US TO DO THAT.

36:13.670 --> 36:16.332
OK, SO KAT HAS A NASTY
HISTORY OF ADDICTION.

36:16.370 --> 36:18.930
BACK IN 2014,
SHE ALMOST O.D.ed

36:18.970 --> 36:20.767
WITH HER NEWBORN
IN THE CAR.

36:20.810 --> 36:22.971
THE COURTS GRANTED
CUSTODY TO THE GORMANS.

36:23.010 --> 36:24.875
WHAT DO WE KNOW
ABOUT SHELLY AND KAT'S PAST?

36:24.910 --> 36:27.242
THEY COME FROM THE SAME
VIOLENT BROKEN HOME,

36:27.280 --> 36:28.747
SINGLE ALCOHOLIC FATHER.

36:28.780 --> 36:29.872
SHELLY DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL.

36:29.920 --> 36:31.547
SHE STARTED WORKING A LOT
IN BALTIMORE.

36:31.590 --> 36:33.410
SHE GOT FIRED A LOT,
HAD A LONG LIST

36:33.450 --> 36:35.213
OF COURT MANDATED
ANGER MANAGEMENT CLASSES.

36:35.260 --> 36:36.284
WELL, THAT RAGE
WOULD EXPLAIN

36:36.320 --> 36:37.753
THE EXTREME ATTACK
ON TRISH.

36:37.790 --> 36:40.281
LEWIS: SO SHE CLEANS UP
HER ACT, MOVES TO HITCHENS,

36:40.330 --> 36:42.355
MEETS A NICE DOCTOR,
MARRIES UP.

36:42.400 --> 36:43.594
SHE'S MANIPULATIVE.

36:43.630 --> 36:45.621
IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS IS
ABOUT SURVIVAL FOR HER.

36:45.670 --> 36:47.365
I MEAN, SHE'D DO ANYTHING
TO KEEP THE LIFE

36:47.400 --> 36:48.367
SHE'S MADE FOR HERSELF.

36:48.400 --> 36:49.936
GARCIA.

36:49.970 --> 36:51.301
OK, I'M SENDING
KAT'S APARTMENT

36:51.340 --> 36:53.535
AND SHELLY GORMAN'S
ADDRESS NOW.

36:55.640 --> 36:57.733
THE THING IS, KAT,

36:57.780 --> 37:00.806
I MEAN, SINCE WE WERE KIDS
YOU'VE BEEN TERRIBLE.

37:00.850 --> 37:03.011
YOU LIE--LOOK AT YOU.

37:03.050 --> 37:05.883
YOU'RE NEVER GOING
TO GET IT TOGETHER.

37:05.920 --> 37:07.888
I'M TRYING.

37:07.920 --> 37:10.957
IT'S JUST THAT
YOU MADE ME...

37:10.990 --> 37:13.982
MADE--MADE--
MADE YOU WHAT?

37:14.030 --> 37:15.554
HELP YOU.

37:15.600 --> 37:18.990
NO, THAT WASN'T--
THAT WASN'T A CHOICE.

37:19.030 --> 37:21.897
TRISH WAS GONNA GET US
ALL INTO TROUBLE.

37:21.940 --> 37:23.896
AND IF JOE AND I
GOT IN TROUBLE,

37:23.940 --> 37:25.828
WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO PROVIDE

37:25.870 --> 37:28.009
A SAFE LIFE FOR JUSTINE.

37:28.040 --> 37:29.337
I KNOW YOU'RE DEALING,

37:29.380 --> 37:31.940
BUT YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO
KILL ANYONE, SHELL.

37:31.980 --> 37:34.346
AND NOW THE FBI ARE HERE.

37:34.380 --> 37:37.269
THEY'RE GONNA FIGURE IT
OUT AND THEN WHAT, HMM?

37:37.320 --> 37:38.844
THEY'RE GONNA FIGURE OUT
WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

37:38.890 --> 37:41.779
YOU'VE DONE
ALL THIS, KAT.

37:41.820 --> 37:45.950
THAT'S THE STORY.
THERE'S NO CHOICE HERE.

37:45.990 --> 37:48.891
YOU REMEMBER WHAT
HAPPENED WITH DAD?

37:48.930 --> 37:50.898
IT'S LIKE THAT.

37:50.930 --> 37:54.058
BECAUSE IF YOU
DRAG ME INTO THIS,

37:54.100 --> 37:58.434
YOU'LL RUIN EVERYTHING
FOR HER, OK?

37:58.470 --> 38:00.006
THINK ABOUT IT.

38:04.710 --> 38:06.849
YOU CAN GO TO JAIL...

38:10.950 --> 38:15.057
OR YOU CAN JUST
GO TO SLEEP.

38:15.090 --> 38:18.719
YOU WANT ME
TO KILL MYSELF?

38:23.100 --> 38:25.364
SHE'LL GROW UP WITHOUT ME.

38:25.400 --> 38:27.891
SHE ALREADY IS, KAT.

38:27.930 --> 38:30.467
YOU MADE YOUR CHOICE
AFTER SHE WAS BORN.

38:30.500 --> 38:32.866
YOU LOVE THESE LITTLE PILLS
MORE THAN YOU LOVE HER.

38:32.910 --> 38:35.777
THE COURTS--THE COURTS AGREE.

38:35.810 --> 38:39.041
THAT'S WHY THEY TOOK HER
AWAY FROM YOU.

38:39.080 --> 38:43.369
LOOK, JOE AND I JUST WANT
TO PROVIDE HER A SAFE HOME,

38:43.420 --> 38:46.082
ONE THAT YOU AND I
NEVER HAD.

38:53.030 --> 38:56.022
HONEY...

38:56.060 --> 38:57.755
SAY GOOD-BYE TO MOMMY.

38:57.800 --> 38:59.358
WE JUST GOT HERE.

38:59.400 --> 39:01.095
I KNOW. WE'RE JUST HAVING
A QUICK VISIT TODAY.

39:01.130 --> 39:03.360
COME ON.

39:03.400 --> 39:04.901
HEY.

39:04.940 --> 39:10.003
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH,
SWEETHEART.

39:10.040 --> 39:12.804
LET'S GO SEE
UNCLE JOE, OK?

39:12.850 --> 39:13.874
SAY "BYE, MOMMY."

39:13.910 --> 39:15.548
BYE, MOMMY.

39:23.520 --> 39:26.080
HEY. I JUST FOUND OUT
MORE BAD NEWS

39:26.130 --> 39:28.086
ABOUT KAT AND SHELLY.
WHEN THEY WERE TEENAGERS,

39:28.130 --> 39:29.950
THEIR DAD WAS
BRUTALLY ATTACKED,

39:30.000 --> 39:31.661
A LOT LIKE WHAT
HAPPENED TO TRISH,

39:31.700 --> 39:34.396
AND THE TRIAL
PUT KAT IN JUVIE.

39:34.440 --> 39:35.998
SHELLY COULD HAVE TALKED KAT
INTO TAKING THE FALL

39:36.040 --> 39:37.667
AND DID IT AGAIN NOW.

39:37.700 --> 39:40.032
KAT'S DAUGHTER ISN'T SAFE
WITH EITHER OF THOSE WOMEN.

39:40.070 --> 39:42.709
WELL, THAT LITTLE GIRL
WOULD BE SAFE
WITH DR. GORMAN.

39:42.740 --> 39:47.040
HE'S TOTALLY CHECKING OUT.
HIS ONLY SIN
IS MARRYING THAT SHELLY.

39:51.690 --> 39:53.988
SHELLY GORMAN, FBI!

39:54.020 --> 39:55.180
KEEP YOUR HANDS
WHERE WE CAN SEE THEM.

39:55.220 --> 39:56.756
STAY RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE.

39:56.790 --> 39:58.155
NO, NO, NO, NO.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

39:58.190 --> 39:59.919
YOU'VE GOT THIS WRONG.

39:59.960 --> 40:01.120
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST
FOR THE MURDER
OF JAMES MACKENZIE

40:01.160 --> 40:03.151
AND THE ATTEMPTED MURDER
OF TRISH GAINES.

40:03.200 --> 40:06.920
DON'T YOU COME NEAR ME!
DON'T YOU DARE TOUCH ME!

40:06.970 --> 40:09.097
JOE! JOE, CALL A LAWYER!
HONEY, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

40:09.140 --> 40:12.064
YOU ARE MAKING
THE MISTAKE OF YOUR LIFE!

40:12.110 --> 40:13.065
LET GO OF ME!

40:13.110 --> 40:15.601
LET GO OF ME!

40:17.240 --> 40:19.174
SHE'S DOWN!

40:27.120 --> 40:29.179
AND THERE'S NO BREATH,
NO PULSE.

40:29.220 --> 40:30.687
ALVEZ: MEDICS ARE HERE.

40:40.270 --> 40:43.091
ROSSI: SHE'S ALIVE.

40:44.740 --> 40:47.959
IF WE LIVE IN THE LAND
OF THE FREE,

40:48.010 --> 40:50.899
WHY ARE SO MANY PEOPLE
NUMBING THEMSELVES?

40:50.940 --> 40:53.204
THEY'RE JUST
IN A LOT OF PAIN.

40:53.250 --> 40:55.115
PHYSICALLY, EMOTIONALLY.

40:55.150 --> 40:57.744
DRUGS SEEM LIKE
THEIR ONLY SOLUTION.

40:57.780 --> 40:59.839
THEY'RE NOT
A SOLUTION.

41:06.290 --> 41:07.928
THANK YOU, GUYS,
FOR BEING HERE.

41:07.960 --> 41:10.155
WE'RE JUST GLAD
YOUR MOM'S AWAKE.

41:10.200 --> 41:12.191
SHE'S GONNA BE OK.

41:12.230 --> 41:14.539
SO ARE YOU.

41:19.570 --> 41:20.798
LET'S GET READY.

41:20.840 --> 41:21.807
REID: FOR WHAT?

41:21.840 --> 41:23.000
YOU'LL SEE.

41:25.980 --> 41:28.517
MAN: * ANYWHERE YOU'RE GOING
IS ON MY WAY *

41:28.550 --> 41:29.812
* I DRIVE ALL NIGHT...

41:29.850 --> 41:31.078
YOU DID ALL THIS?

41:31.120 --> 41:32.189
WITH A LITTLE HELP.

41:32.220 --> 41:35.883
HAPPY NEW YEAR
TO ALL MY FAVORITE PEOPLE.

41:35.920 --> 41:37.285
SALUD.
