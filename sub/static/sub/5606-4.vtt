that money all over the Island

it was just a matter of time

05:38.848 --> 05:40.281
who, by the way, is dead--

05:40.283 --> 05:42.016

it to bankroll

05:49.526 --> 05:51.392
do you?

05:51.394 --> 05:54.762
Okay, look, we found the money

06:16.553 --> 06:18.319
No I.D. on the Vic.

06:18.321 --> 06:21.289
C.O.D. was a single carbon arrow
through the chest.

06:21.291 --> 06:23.224
Pierced the sternum
and punctured the heart.

06:23.226 --> 06:26.794

between 4:00 and 6:00 a.m.

06:26.796 --> 06:28.396
Murder by bow and arrow.

06:28.398 --> 06:30.498

just leaves it here.

shot him from a distance,

he looked like back in the day.

10:57.559 --> 11:00.727

11:34.796 --> 11:36.663

the face of the planet.

11:36.665 --> 11:39.265

great unsolved mysteries.

11:51.313 --> 11:54.247

there are a lot of theories.

to dodge the IRS,

11:57.252 --> 11:59.185
others think
it was a psychotic break,

11:59.187 --> 12:01.254
and there are some
who have posited

12:01.256 --> 12:03.423
that it could have been
an abduction.

12:04.892 --> 12:07.594
And by "abduction,"
I mean alien abduction.

12:08.762 --> 12:12.432
Clearly, the guy was holed up
somewhere on the Island.

12:12.434 --> 12:14.100
Well, he did have properties
all over Oahu.

12:14.102 --> 12:16.336
He was actually the sole heir
to a real estate fortune

12:16.338 --> 12:17.971
worth millions--
except that when he died,

12:17.973 --> 12:20.052
there was no one left
to manage any of it.

12:20.076 --> 12:20.641
Yeah, we're talking

12:20.642 --> 12:22.876
primo properties
in Kahala and Waimanalo,

12:22.878 --> 12:25.945
completely abandoned
and left to fall into disrepair.

12:25.947 --> 12:27.714
To this day,
you can find homeless people

12:27.716 --> 12:29.215
squatting
in vacant beachfront mansions

12:29.217 --> 12:31.050
Crane never even bothered
to evict.

12:31.052 --> 12:32.485
Which pissed off the neighbors

12:32.487 --> 12:35.003
when they saw
their property values take a nosedive.

12:35.023 --> 12:36.891
GROVER: Well, hell, that
sounds like a good motive.

12:36.892 --> 12:38.224
You take a bath on your house,

12:38.226 --> 12:39.893
the whole thing is Crane's
fault-- you figure out

12:39.895 --> 12:41.494
a way to draw him out
and kill him.

12:41.496 --> 12:42.762
Yeah, I'm not so sure
about that.

12:42.764 --> 12:43.863
I just came from the lab.

12:43.865 --> 12:45.465
So, they matched the DNA

12:45.467 --> 12:47.967
off the arrow to a recently
released ex-con named Ano Kahue.

12:47.969 --> 12:49.969
When the cops went
to pick him up,

12:49.971 --> 12:51.271
he immediately confessed.

12:51.273 --> 12:53.206
He said that he was
out hunting and he saw

12:53.208 --> 12:55.041
what he thought was a boar
moving through the brush.

12:55.043 --> 12:56.543
When he discovered
he'd killed Crane,

12:56.545 --> 12:58.177
he panicked and fled the scene.

12:58.179 --> 12:59.612
And he left all
that money there?

12:59.614 --> 13:01.381
Yeah, when
I asked him about that,

13:01.383 --> 13:03.116
he said that killing Crane
was an accident

13:03.118 --> 13:04.984
but taking the money
would have been stealing.

13:04.986 --> 13:07.153
Ex-con with a moral compass.

13:07.155 --> 13:08.354
KONO: He also
offered to take

13:08.356 --> 13:10.189
a polygraph,
so I'm inclined to believe him.

13:10.191 --> 13:13.159
Okay, so our murder was
actually a hunting accident.

13:13.161 --> 13:14.627
Still doesn't explain
what Crane was doing

13:14.629 --> 13:16.963
in the middle of nowhere with
a million in counterfeit cash.

13:16.965 --> 13:18.765
Uh, turns out
there is someone we know

13:18.767 --> 13:20.199
that might actually have
some answers.

13:20.201 --> 13:21.167
The lab found

13:21.169 --> 13:23.169
some prints
on a bunch of the bills.

13:23.171 --> 13:24.270
(beeping)

13:24.272 --> 13:25.772
Remember this weasel?

13:27.207 --> 13:28.308
Gerard Hirsch.

13:28.310 --> 13:29.842
Shady art appraiser.

13:29.844 --> 13:31.611
And, if I recall
correctly,

13:31.613 --> 13:32.946
he was quite smitten with you.

13:32.948 --> 13:34.914
Uh, sure,
until he realized I was a cop

13:34.916 --> 13:37.183
and he either had to cooperate
or go to jail.

13:37.185 --> 13:38.718
Yeah, well,
either way,

13:38.720 --> 13:40.820
looks like this bird
hasn't learned his lesson yet.

13:40.822 --> 13:42.989
No, HPD busted him
with a bunch of forgeries.

13:42.991 --> 13:44.857
He just got out of Halawa
last month.

13:44.859 --> 13:47.160
All right,
how do we find him now?

13:47.162 --> 13:50.229

14:01.309 --> 14:04.010
You know something, buddy?
This one's on the house today.

14:04.012 --> 14:05.111
How about that, huh?

14:05.113 --> 14:06.479
Huh? You like that?
Thank you.

14:06.481 --> 14:08.147
Thanks for visiting
our island.

14:08.149 --> 14:12.085
Officer Kalakaua, I see you're
displaying your badge today.

14:12.087 --> 14:14.487
Ah. Yeah. You know,

14:14.489 --> 14:16.155
when your P.O.
said you'd be here,

14:16.157 --> 14:18.224
we expected to find you
sipping Moet by the pool.

14:18.226 --> 14:19.892
Not this.
What can I say?

14:19.894 --> 14:21.327
Times are tough.

14:21.329 --> 14:24.631
The particulars of my parole
forbid me from participating

14:24.633 --> 14:26.966
in any art transactions.

14:27.868 --> 14:29.469
KONO: Isn't this
technically

14:29.471 --> 14:31.938
an art transaction?
Really?

14:31.940 --> 14:34.774
You're gonna write me up
for selling caricatures

14:34.776 --> 14:37.910

$30?! I should. Right now.

14:37.912 --> 14:39.612
No, we got you

14:39.614 --> 14:40.913
Let's go.

14:45.285 --> 14:47.387
WOMAN:
Doesn't make sense.

14:47.389 --> 14:49.922
In the 15 years
I've worked here,

14:49.924 --> 14:52.692
(camera shutter clicking)
Mr. Crane never once left the property.

14:52.694 --> 14:54.427
When was the last time
you saw him?

14:54.429 --> 14:55.628
A few months ago, maybe.

14:55.630 --> 14:57.063
I leave his meals
and laundry

14:57.065 --> 14:58.498
by the door
to his quarters.

14:58.500 --> 15:00.767
If he needs something,
he just leaves me a note.

15:00.769 --> 15:01.934
CHIN:
So you're saying

15:01.936 --> 15:04.437
you've never been inside?
As far as I know,

15:04.439 --> 15:06.973
no one other than Mr. Crane
has ever stepped foot

15:06.975 --> 15:08.508
beyond that door.

15:08.510 --> 15:10.276
Yeah?

15:11.845 --> 15:14.280
Well, that's about to change.

15:19.987 --> 15:22.321
Well, Crane
obviously didn't keep up

15:22.323 --> 15:24.624
with the latest decorating
trends, but, uh,

15:24.626 --> 15:26.592
the man was quite tidy.

15:26.594 --> 15:28.628
This place is like
a time capsule.

15:28.630 --> 15:30.863

If I pass out...

15:30.865 --> 15:32.465
take over filming for me.

15:32.467 --> 15:35.435
Jerry, you do know
that the crime lab

15:35.437 --> 15:37.503
is gonna take pictures
of everything, right?

15:37.505 --> 15:40.807
Oh, these are
for my personal collection.

15:40.809 --> 15:42.975
GROVER: I'll tell you, man,
I've seen some crazy

15:42.977 --> 15:45.545
in my day, but what kind
of guy just up and decides

15:45.547 --> 15:47.180
he wants to live like this?

15:47.182 --> 15:49.749
Someone with a severe case
of OCD.

15:49.751 --> 15:51.718
Take a look. Book,

15:51.720 --> 15:54.520
comb, glasses, pen and watch.

15:54.522 --> 15:57.323
Random items... yet
they're arranged alphabetically.

15:57.325 --> 15:59.392
Yeah, and look
at these cans.

15:59.394 --> 16:02.295
It looks like a grocery store in
here, all the labels facing out.

16:02.297 --> 16:04.030
JERRY:
This is a person who is obsessed

16:04.032 --> 16:05.131
with getting things in order.

16:05.133 --> 16:06.966
GROVER: Oh, that goes a long way
to explain

16:06.968 --> 16:08.768
why he was so terrified
of the outside world.

16:08.770 --> 16:10.369
Lou.
Yeah?

16:10.371 --> 16:13.673
You notice what's different
about these pictures here?

16:15.576 --> 16:18.911
They're the only ones
that aren't ancient.

16:18.913 --> 16:20.580
Everything else
is from before

16:20.582 --> 16:22.148
Crane went full recluse.

16:22.150 --> 16:24.417
This guy has no family,
and up until a day ago

16:24.419 --> 16:25.852
he never even left the house.

16:25.854 --> 16:27.720
Why is he holding on
to this girl's picture?

16:27.722 --> 16:29.388
CHIN: I don't know.
But these photos

16:29.390 --> 16:31.224
do look like
they were taken recently,

16:31.226 --> 16:33.590
so if we can find her,
maybe we can get some answers.

16:33.614 --> 16:34.995
Yeah.

16:34.996 --> 16:37.697
Who's the homeless
dead guy?

16:37.699 --> 16:39.365
All right,
don't insult us.

16:39.367 --> 16:40.833
You know it's
Harrison Crane.

16:40.835 --> 16:42.468
And we know the two of you
have been

16:42.470 --> 16:43.836
in contact with
each other.

16:43.838 --> 16:45.171
I believe you're mistaken.

16:45.173 --> 16:46.639
In fact, I'm quite sure
that no one

16:46.641 --> 16:49.075
has been in contact with Crane
for quite some time.

16:49.077 --> 16:52.011
That guy made J.D. Salinger
look like a social butterfly.

16:52.013 --> 16:54.213
You done?
Okay, good.

16:54.215 --> 16:55.448
Maybe you can explain to us

16:55.450 --> 16:58.184
how your prints got
on almost $900,000 worth

16:58.186 --> 16:59.886
of counterfeit cash that he had

16:59.888 --> 17:02.188
on his person when he died.
Hold up.

17:02.190 --> 17:04.290
Counterfeit?

17:04.291 --> 17:05.992
That little weasel.

17:05.993 --> 17:07.160
Sorry?

17:07.162 --> 17:09.494
A few weeks ago
I sold some paintings

17:09.497 --> 17:10.863
to this gangster wannabe

17:10.865 --> 17:13.199
named Miko Mosley.

17:13.201 --> 17:15.101
Yes, I've been
dealing art again.

17:15.103 --> 17:16.569
Put me in solitary.

17:16.570 --> 17:18.570
Anyway, Mosley paid me in cash,

17:18.573 --> 17:20.772
cash that I in turn
gave to Crane.

17:20.775 --> 17:23.209
But I had no idea
that money was fake.

17:24.178 --> 17:27.780
Okay, wait. So you
can identify phony artwork

17:27.781 --> 17:29.315
but not currency?
My dear,

17:29.317 --> 17:31.717
spotting a bogus van Gogh
is one thing;

17:31.719 --> 17:34.887
a bogus Benjamin is
a different skill set.

17:34.889 --> 17:36.956
Okay, today we don't care
about counterfeit cash,

17:36.958 --> 17:38.457
we don't care
about parole violations--

17:38.459 --> 17:41.594
we want to know about Crane
and what the money was for.

17:41.596 --> 17:43.129
A painting.

17:43.131 --> 17:44.497
Crane called me
late last night.

17:44.499 --> 17:47.500
He was trying to unload
this very lovely Edward Hopper

17:47.502 --> 17:49.836
that I actually had sold him
25 years ago

17:49.838 --> 17:51.737
back when
I was first starting out.

17:51.739 --> 17:53.973
He offered
to sell it to me cheap,

17:53.975 --> 17:57.343
like <i>way</i> below what
he could get for it at auction.

17:57.345 --> 17:58.978
I thought he was kidding, but...

17:58.980 --> 18:01.547
sure enough,
I showed up with the cash,

18:01.549 --> 18:04.450
and I left his house with the painting.
Okay, wait.

18:04.452 --> 18:06.452
There's plenty legitimate
art dealers out there,

18:06.454 --> 18:08.120
so why come to you?

18:08.122 --> 18:10.256
Well, he said he needed
the money right away.

18:10.258 --> 18:12.391
<i>And</i> it had to be in cash.

18:12.393 --> 18:14.093
For others,
that was a deal breaker.

18:14.095 --> 18:15.628
(phone ringing)
He was desperate.

18:17.164 --> 18:20.867
I see, uh, someone
put a ring on that.

18:20.869 --> 18:22.969
Yeah, beat you to it.

18:23.804 --> 18:26.772
Unlucky you.

18:26.774 --> 18:29.342
STEVE (over radio): Chin, what do you got?
Well, looks like Crane may not

18:29.344 --> 18:31.477
have been as cut off from
the outside world as we thought.

18:31.479 --> 18:34.447
We found several recent
photographs of a young woman

18:34.449 --> 18:36.649
at his place--
facial rec I.D.'d her

18:36.651 --> 18:39.010
as Laura Ioane, 30 years old,
local.

18:39.011 --> 18:40.888
Okay, what's Crane's
connection to Laura?

18:40.889 --> 18:42.688
I'm not sure, because
we can't seem to find her.

18:42.690 --> 18:44.390
Her cell phone's turned off
and her boss says

18:44.392 --> 18:45.925
she didn't turn up
to work this morning.

18:45.927 --> 18:46.993
Hey. That McGarrett?

18:46.995 --> 18:48.361
Yeah.
All right, check this out.

18:48.939 --> 18:50.446
Crane has a landline here

18:50.447 --> 18:53.115
and it hadn't been used
in years, until last night

18:53.117 --> 18:55.550
he gets a phone call
from a burner cell.

18:55.552 --> 18:58.320
Right after that,
he calls this Laura

18:58.322 --> 19:01.389
six times in a row-- all
the calls went unanswered.

19:01.391 --> 19:04.259
Hold on a minute.
We got six frantic

19:04.261 --> 19:06.094
phone calls to a woman
that we can't find?

19:06.096 --> 19:08.263
That's right-- followed
by our Vic headed out

19:08.265 --> 19:10.599
to this secluded spot
with a bag full of money.

19:10.601 --> 19:12.868
The whole thing adds up
to just one thing.

19:12.870 --> 19:14.870
Crane was on his way
to a ransom drop.

19:14.872 --> 19:17.439
This is a kidnapping.

19:24.139 --> 19:26.697
Jimmy, keep him on ice for me.
You got it, Commander.

19:27.138 --> 19:29.406
All right.
Let me know.

19:30.555 --> 19:33.456
All right, so the burner the kidnapper
used had been turned off.

19:33.458 --> 19:36.326
CSU will track it if it powers back up.
Our biggest problem

19:36.328 --> 19:38.495
right now is the media--
we cannot let the news

19:38.497 --> 19:40.063
of Crane's death
get leaked, okay?

19:40.065 --> 19:42.365
If the kidnapper finds out
Crane's body's in the morgue,

19:42.367 --> 19:44.334
he's gonna cut his losses
and kill Laura.

19:44.336 --> 19:45.602
It's been hours
since Crane

19:45.604 --> 19:47.003
missed the ransom drop--
our kidnapper's gonna know

19:47.005 --> 19:48.505
something went wrong.
Yeah, the kidnapper

19:48.507 --> 19:51.040
also knows that he chose
an unpredictable, eccentric target.

19:51.042 --> 19:53.042
My guess, he's gonna
practice patience,

19:53.044 --> 19:54.944
eventually he's gonna call back.
In the meantime,

19:54.946 --> 19:57.280
we need to figure out what
the connection between Laura

19:57.282 --> 19:59.315
and Crane is.

20:00.684 --> 20:03.186
Her name is Laura Ioane.
You know her?

20:03.188 --> 20:04.487
Did something happen?

20:04.489 --> 20:06.156
KONO:
She was kidnapped.

20:06.158 --> 20:08.091
Your client was called
to pay the ransom,

20:08.093 --> 20:10.293
but he was killed
before he could deliver it.

about the connection between

20:20.439 --> 20:23.206
Yeah.

20:23.208 --> 20:24.808
Laura's mother Peggy
was a waitress

20:24.810 --> 20:26.443
at a coffee shop in Waipahu

20:26.445 --> 20:29.179
Harrison used to frequent
back in the '70s.

20:29.181 --> 20:31.047
They became
romantically involved.

20:31.049 --> 20:32.849
It didn't last long.

20:32.851 --> 20:34.884
Once Harrison's issues
started getting in the way,

20:34.886 --> 20:35.952
he ended it.

20:35.954 --> 20:39.055
But Peggy was always
his one true love,

20:39.057 --> 20:42.025
and after she died,
Harrison took it upon himself

20:42.027 --> 20:43.893
to provide for her daughter.

20:43.895 --> 20:45.795
Laura's father
was a deadbeat,

20:45.797 --> 20:50.800
and so Harrison directed me
to set up a trust in her name.

20:50.802 --> 20:52.402
At the time,

20:52.404 --> 20:55.338
he did this solely
out of his love for Peggy,

20:55.340 --> 20:58.575
but as the years went by,
he grew quite fond of Laura.

20:58.577 --> 21:01.411
And then the two stayed
in touch, trading letters.

21:01.413 --> 21:02.879
Who else knows about this?

21:02.881 --> 21:04.547
I honestly
couldn't say.

21:04.549 --> 21:06.549
Harrison didn't speak
to very many people,

21:06.551 --> 21:08.084
(chuckles): especially
in recent years.

21:08.086 --> 21:11.287
And, uh, of course, I was barred from
ever mentioning Laura to anyone.

21:11.289 --> 21:13.990
What about Laura?
Was there anything

21:13.992 --> 21:17.126
to stop her from discussing
her connection to Crane?

21:17.128 --> 21:19.329
Well, it's no secret
Harrison guarded his privacy,

21:19.331 --> 21:21.164
so I imagine Laura would have

21:21.166 --> 21:23.900
respected that--
but to answer your question,

21:23.902 --> 21:26.836
no, she could have told
whomever she wanted.

21:32.243 --> 21:34.711
You know, not long ago...

21:34.713 --> 21:37.380
I was in the same
predicament you are.

21:37.382 --> 21:39.682
So I know what's going
through your mind.

21:39.684 --> 21:41.985
Stall for time.

21:41.987 --> 21:44.187
Right now that's
what it's all about.

21:44.189 --> 21:46.022
I'm not stalling.

21:46.024 --> 21:47.824
I've told you everything.

21:47.826 --> 21:49.526
You've given me some
light background

21:49.528 --> 21:51.127
on Gabriel's organization.

21:51.129 --> 21:53.630
That's trivial.

21:53.632 --> 21:55.398
What I need...

21:55.400 --> 21:58.067
is Gabriel's
present location.

21:58.069 --> 21:59.702
Not where he was last week

21:59.704 --> 22:02.572
or where he's gonna be in a month.
I don't know

22:02.574 --> 22:04.474
how many different ways
I can say it,

22:04.476 --> 22:06.843
but I can't give you information
that I don't have.

22:06.845 --> 22:09.345
I don't believe you.

22:09.347 --> 22:12.148
More importantly,
those men out there--

22:12.150 --> 22:14.884
they don't believe you.

22:14.886 --> 22:18.021
If you want to get out of
here alive and in one piece,

22:18.023 --> 22:20.623
you'll tell me what
I want to know.

22:20.625 --> 22:23.927
If you don't,
they'll kill you.

22:25.162 --> 22:26.996
Adam.

22:36.040 --> 22:37.974
You're getting nowhere.

22:37.976 --> 22:40.043
You want to break this guy,
it's gonna take more than words.

22:40.045 --> 22:42.178
Threats mean nothing
to a man like this.

22:42.180 --> 22:43.947
And by the way,

22:43.949 --> 22:46.449
don't think for a second
that if he walks out of here

22:46.451 --> 22:48.785
he's not gonna come after you,
because he will.

22:48.787 --> 22:51.821
He'll come after you
and everyone you care about.

22:53.591 --> 22:56.459
Starting with that
lovely wife of yours.

23:16.113 --> 23:19.816
That supposed to scare me?

23:19.818 --> 23:21.117
The Ivy League boy

23:21.119 --> 23:23.620
who gave up everything
for some piece of ass

23:23.622 --> 23:26.155
is gonna get rough?
Please.

23:28.525 --> 23:30.526
Where is Gabriel?

23:30.528 --> 23:32.729
Where is he?!

23:40.371 --> 23:42.905
You can keep doing this
until your hand breaks

23:42.907 --> 23:45.274
and you're gonna
keep getting the same answer.

23:45.276 --> 23:46.809
Let's find out.

23:48.045 --> 23:49.445
All right, thanks.

23:49.447 --> 23:51.314
Okay, so a search of Laura's
apartment came up empty.

23:51.316 --> 23:53.082
No signs of a
break-in or struggle.

23:53.084 --> 23:55.451
Okay, clearly, the abduction
happened elsewhere.

23:55.453 --> 23:57.620
Let's get location data from
her cell carrier, all right?

23:57.622 --> 23:59.689
That's gonna give us a list
of places that Laura

23:59.691 --> 24:00.923
went to frequently.

24:00.925 --> 24:02.659
Chances are she got picked up
from one of them.

24:02.661 --> 24:05.328
Copy that. HPD's also
looking into Laura's friends

24:05.330 --> 24:07.930
and relatives, cross-referencing
for any criminal records.

24:07.932 --> 24:09.932
Okay, good.

24:09.934 --> 24:12.168
Jerry...

24:13.537 --> 24:15.271
You all right?

24:15.273 --> 24:17.540
KONO: What's the matter?
Take a look.

24:17.542 --> 24:18.608
Details are sketchy,

24:18.610 --> 24:20.343
but we can confirm the body

24:20.345 --> 24:22.779
of reclusive real estate magnate
Harrison Crane

24:22.781 --> 24:24.981
was found in Makua Forest
early this morning.

24:24.983 --> 24:26.916
A police investigation
is underway

24:26.918 --> 24:29.385
and we're hearing reports
that this may have been

24:29.387 --> 24:31.287
a hunting accident.
However, there's

24:31.289 --> 24:33.523
no official statement from
the Honolulu Police Department.

24:33.525 --> 24:36.192
She's probably dead already,
isn't she?

24:36.194 --> 24:38.561
Mr. Crane had no known family
and hadn't been seen

24:38.563 --> 24:41.497
or heard from
in more than 20 years.

24:41.499 --> 24:44.167
One silk handkerchief,
one fountain pen,

24:44.169 --> 24:46.202
one set of keys,
one cell phone.

24:46.204 --> 24:48.671
Sign here.

24:48.673 --> 24:50.173
And this thing has been
ringing like crazy.

24:50.175 --> 24:52.108
Thanks.

25:06.724 --> 25:09.058
(phone rings)

25:09.060 --> 25:10.727
Go for Gerard.

25:10.729 --> 25:13.129
KIDNAPPER: You should really
answer your phone, Mr. Hirsch.

25:13.131 --> 25:14.630
Who is this?

25:14.632 --> 25:17.600
Shut up and listen to me
very carefully.

25:19.369 --> 25:21.904
KONO:
<i>So he wants the painting?</i>

25:21.906 --> 25:24.674
Yes, and he threatened
to kill this Laura Ioane woman

25:24.676 --> 25:26.709
and come after me
if I don't hand it over.

25:26.711 --> 25:28.678
That's a pretty desperate play.

25:28.680 --> 25:31.681
My question is how did he even
know about the Hopper?

25:31.683 --> 25:33.316
Well, he probably had Crane
under surveillance

25:33.318 --> 25:35.318
from the moment
he put this thing in motion.

25:35.320 --> 25:36.919
If that's the case,
last night when you went

25:36.921 --> 25:39.055
to Crane's house he would have
you leave with the painting.

25:39.057 --> 25:40.590
Well, he said he would call back

25:40.592 --> 25:42.225
with a time and place
for the drop.

25:42.227 --> 25:43.526
Well, that's perfect.
When he does,

25:43.528 --> 25:44.927
you keep him talking,
we'll run a trace.

25:44.929 --> 25:46.596
What we have to do, though,
is get the painting back.

25:46.598 --> 25:47.797
So where is it now?

25:47.799 --> 25:49.465
Actually,

25:49.467 --> 25:51.701
I don't have it anymore.
I flipped it to a collector

25:51.703 --> 25:53.269
this morning.
Then get it back.

25:53.271 --> 25:55.738
That might prove difficult.
This particular collector

25:55.740 --> 25:59.008
is not what I would call
a friend of law enforcement.

25:59.010 --> 26:00.843
In fact, he's

26:00.845 --> 26:02.478
a Russian crime lord.

26:02.480 --> 26:04.013
Alexander Kozlov.

26:04.015 --> 26:05.515
I never heard of him.

26:05.517 --> 26:07.316
Well, if you had, he wouldn't be
doing his job very well.

26:07.318 --> 26:10.486
Well, crime lord or not,
we need to get that painting.

26:10.488 --> 26:12.455
We could try appealing
to his better angels,

26:12.457 --> 26:14.290
but I think that's a nonstarter.

26:14.292 --> 26:16.125
Or we could just take it back.

26:16.127 --> 26:18.161
That's a much better plan.

26:18.163 --> 26:21.030
Assuming the painting
is still on the island.

26:21.032 --> 26:23.199
What?
Why wouldn't it be?

26:23.201 --> 26:25.168
Because there's a good chance
that Kozlov's people

26:25.170 --> 26:26.869
were planning
to smuggle it out today.

26:26.871 --> 26:28.070
I forgot

26:28.072 --> 26:30.206
to mention this earlier,

26:30.208 --> 26:31.941
but the Hopper actually

26:31.943 --> 26:34.710
fell off the back of a truck
25 years ago.

26:34.712 --> 26:36.312
It's a stolen piece.

26:36.314 --> 26:39.148
Anything else?

26:39.150 --> 26:41.350
Look, if this painting
disappears,

26:41.352 --> 26:43.052
then our girl dies.

26:59.677 --> 27:01.006
(horn blares)

27:02.977 --> 27:04.244
Is your foot even on the gas?

27:04.246 --> 27:05.479
There's a reason we always

27:05.481 --> 27:07.381
take Danny's car, okay?

27:11.753 --> 27:13.654
KONO:
I see why.

27:19.627 --> 27:21.462
(speaks Russian)

27:26.668 --> 27:27.968
Uh, they wouldn't just toss

27:27.970 --> 27:29.503
a $3 million painting
out the window.

27:29.505 --> 27:30.938
Hold on.

27:44.085 --> 27:45.452
Out of the car!

27:46.221 --> 27:48.455
KONO:
There it is, center lane!

27:49.524 --> 27:51.959
(horn blaring)

27:54.295 --> 27:58.232
Go over there.
Careful!

27:58.234 --> 27:59.833
Steve!

28:11.079 --> 28:12.546
All right, get
him in here.

28:14.449 --> 28:17.351
Hirsch, let's go.
You're up.

28:21.022 --> 28:22.623
This it?

28:23.558 --> 28:24.992
Well...

28:24.994 --> 28:27.895
STEVE:
Is this the Hopper?

28:27.897 --> 28:29.997
Yep, that's it.
Good as new.

28:29.999 --> 28:32.165
So I guess my work
is done here, right?

28:32.167 --> 28:35.502
Not quite.

28:35.504 --> 28:36.770
This is hideous.

28:36.772 --> 28:38.405
Put it on.
You don't have a choice.

28:38.407 --> 28:40.374
If you're gonna
make a shirt

28:40.376 --> 28:42.409
with a built-in wire,
why can't it be

28:42.411 --> 28:44.044
practical
<i>and</i> stylish?

28:44.046 --> 28:46.280
This shirt just might
save your life.

28:46.282 --> 28:49.550
If it doesn't,
don't let me get buried in it.

28:49.552 --> 28:53.186
Okay, how does it look?
Honestly?

28:54.355 --> 28:56.323
You look fine.

28:56.325 --> 28:58.659
Okay, so, look,
we'll be listening in

28:58.661 --> 28:59.960
and have eyes on you
the whole time.

28:59.962 --> 29:01.395
First sign of trouble,
we move in.

29:01.397 --> 29:03.830
Can I at least wear
a bulletproof vest?

29:03.832 --> 29:06.433
Why? If they shoot you,
it'll be in the head.

29:06.435 --> 29:09.670
Oh, terrific. Well what if I say
no to all this-- what then?

29:09.672 --> 29:12.506
Then Laura dies and you
go to jail for a very long time.

29:12.508 --> 29:14.808
But if you pull this off,
I will personally

29:14.810 --> 29:16.577
make sure that
all the outstanding charges

29:16.579 --> 29:17.911
against you disappear.

29:17.913 --> 29:20.080
You know, you're the reason

29:20.082 --> 29:21.715
I'm in all this mess
to begin with.

29:21.717 --> 29:23.517
If you hadn't
honeypotted me,

29:23.519 --> 29:25.819
I never would have
fallen for that sting.

29:25.821 --> 29:27.721
I'm sorry-- honey-what?

29:27.723 --> 29:31.091
You used your feminine
charms to entrap me.

29:31.093 --> 29:33.360
I was just doing my job.

29:33.362 --> 29:34.928
Maybe so.

29:34.930 --> 29:37.864
But you can't deny there's...

29:37.866 --> 29:39.366
something between us.

29:39.368 --> 29:41.368
(phone ringing)

29:41.370 --> 29:43.904
It's him.

29:49.744 --> 29:51.311
Okay, you're on.

29:51.313 --> 29:53.747
Hello?

29:53.749 --> 29:54.848
KIDNAPPER:
Do you have the painting?

29:54.850 --> 29:55.949
Yes.

29:55.951 --> 29:57.117
Good.

29:57.119 --> 29:59.753
Take the 22 bus
to Waikiki beach.

29:59.755 --> 30:01.054
Get off at Ohua.

30:01.056 --> 30:02.889
And make sure you come alone.

30:02.891 --> 30:04.091
Wait, um...

30:04.093 --> 30:05.592
how do I find you?

30:05.594 --> 30:08.061
Keep your phone on.

30:08.063 --> 30:10.030
Uh...
(click)

30:12.934 --> 30:15.402
Okay. Let's go.

30:40.728 --> 30:43.864
Got him. Okay,
be advised,

30:43.866 --> 30:44.898
Hirsch just landed.

30:44.900 --> 30:46.933
Copy. I got eyes on him.

30:46.935 --> 30:48.835
Yeah, same here.

30:48.837 --> 30:51.538
CHIN:
Facial rec is up and running.

30:51.540 --> 30:54.007
We're live scanning the crowd
right now.

30:54.009 --> 30:55.509
Nobody moves
until the drop is done

30:55.511 --> 30:57.778
and the kidnapper
has the package in hand.

31:02.283 --> 31:03.884
KONO:
Where is this guy?

31:03.886 --> 31:06.119
(phone rings)

31:12.060 --> 31:13.493
Hello?

31:13.495 --> 31:15.762
KIDNAPPER:
Cross the street.

31:19.901 --> 31:21.968
STEVE:
Okay, Hirsch is on the move.

31:21.970 --> 31:23.804
Copy that.

31:28.509 --> 31:29.843
He's crossing Kalakaua

31:29.845 --> 31:31.144
at Ohua.

31:35.683 --> 31:39.086
Kidnapper's got a signal bouncer
on his phone. We can't trace it.

31:40.354 --> 31:42.289
KIDNAPPER:
The restaurant at the corner.

31:42.291 --> 31:44.491
Head inside.

31:45.860 --> 31:47.828
GROVER:
Hey, we're about to lose visual.

31:47.830 --> 31:49.196
All right, everybody
hold your positions, all right?

31:49.198 --> 31:50.363
Do not blow cover.

31:50.365 --> 31:52.632
Do <i>not</i> blow cover.

31:56.671 --> 31:58.572
Okay, I'm here.

31:58.574 --> 32:00.774
KIDNAPPER:
Give your name to the hostess--

32:00.776 --> 32:03.009
she's expecting you.
(hangs up)

32:06.514 --> 32:08.715
He hung up.

32:10.084 --> 32:11.952
Hello.
Hi.

32:11.954 --> 32:13.920
Gerard Hirsch.
That was fast.

32:13.922 --> 32:15.822
Your friend just called
to say you'd be picking it up.

32:15.824 --> 32:18.191
Must have fallen
out of his pocket at the bar.

32:19.360 --> 32:21.561
Thank you.
You're welcome.

32:22.830 --> 32:25.732
(phone rings)

32:25.734 --> 32:28.268
KIDNAPPER:
Well done. Now dump the phone

32:28.270 --> 32:31.037
you came in with
and head to the gift shop.

32:31.039 --> 32:33.273
You're gonna
buy some new clothes.

32:44.552 --> 32:46.119
Guys, what's going on here?

32:46.121 --> 32:48.021
CHIN: Hirsch should still
be in there. GPS on his phone

32:48.023 --> 32:49.289
show he hasn't moved.

32:49.291 --> 32:51.958
If this deal goes down inside,
we're gonna

32:51.960 --> 32:53.593
lose this guy.

32:53.595 --> 32:55.028
We lost audio.
His wire's down.

32:55.030 --> 32:56.930
Kono, move in.
KONO: Copy that.

33:05.873 --> 33:07.941
STEVE:
Lou, back her up.

33:07.943 --> 33:09.409
You got it.

33:11.045 --> 33:12.445
What do you got?

33:12.447 --> 33:14.347
Guys, I'm not seeing him.

33:14.349 --> 33:16.917
STEVE:
Keep looking.

33:16.919 --> 33:18.919
KIDNAPPER: That's good.
Keep walking straight.

33:18.921 --> 33:22.122
When you get to the corner,
you're gonna turn right.

33:25.159 --> 33:28.728
Now keep moving until you get to
the park bench facing the ocean.

33:28.730 --> 33:30.463
I see it.

33:30.465 --> 33:32.399
The guy feeding the pigeons--

33:32.401 --> 33:34.601
sit down next to him.

33:40.474 --> 33:41.942
Okay. What now?

33:41.944 --> 33:43.443
Leave the bag

33:43.445 --> 33:44.477
and walk away.

33:44.479 --> 33:46.313
When I know
I'm not being followed,

33:46.315 --> 33:48.515
we'll release the girl.

33:50.985 --> 33:54.187
GROVER:
Guys, I got Hirsch.

33:54.189 --> 33:56.790
He just passed Uluniu
and he's headed south.

33:56.792 --> 33:58.592
He changed
his clothes.

33:58.594 --> 33:59.860
He's over there!

33:59.862 --> 34:01.328
He's over there!

34:03.297 --> 34:05.398
Kidnapper's on the move.
He's headed right to you.

34:05.400 --> 34:06.600
We're moving in.

34:11.772 --> 34:13.373
Move!

34:15.676 --> 34:17.777
Hey!

34:19.112 --> 34:20.447
Stop right there! Five-O!

34:21.315 --> 34:22.315
Hey!

34:26.120 --> 34:29.054

(tires screeching)

34:30.324 --> 34:32.158
(panting)

34:42.270 --> 34:43.670
He's dead.

34:43.672 --> 34:46.039
Laura's not here.

34:56.914 --> 34:58.448
Thanks.

34:58.450 --> 35:00.784
Got his phone.
Already checked him for I.D.'s.

35:00.786 --> 35:01.952
Got nothing.

35:01.954 --> 35:03.887
No registration papers either.

35:03.889 --> 35:07.123
It's because it was stolen.
It was called in this morning.

35:07.125 --> 35:09.259
Let's get CSU out here. See if
we can get an I.D. on this guy.

35:09.261 --> 35:11.494
If we can get an I.D.,
maybe we can get an address,

35:11.496 --> 35:13.296
find where he's holding Laura...
GROVER: Gotta see this.

35:13.298 --> 35:15.265
...maybe find an accomplice
he's been partnered with.

35:15.267 --> 35:17.100
Wait. He does have a partner.

35:17.102 --> 35:18.535
KONO:
How do you know?

35:18.537 --> 35:19.836
He told me.

35:19.838 --> 35:21.838
He said once he knows
he's not being followed,

35:21.840 --> 35:23.873
"we'll release the girl."

35:23.875 --> 35:25.542
Okay, so the partner
is sitting on Laura,

35:25.544 --> 35:27.410
waiting to hear
that the drop went down.

35:27.412 --> 35:29.379
Look at this.

35:29.381 --> 35:30.747
The last ten calls
made from this phone

35:30.749 --> 35:33.049
went to the same number.
CHIN: "Mom"?

35:33.051 --> 35:34.284

What kind of kidnapper

35:34.286 --> 35:36.152
loves his mother
that much?

Where's my son?

36:15.493 --> 36:16.626

Laura?

Tell us now.
Grover, stay on her. Chin,

Kono, follow me. We're
gonna search every inch

36:21.066 --> 36:22.532

to be here somewhere.

36:22.534 --> 36:25.335
Turn around.

36:25.337 --> 36:27.337
That man trusted you.

36:27.339 --> 36:28.805
And you betrayed him.

36:28.807 --> 36:31.641
He shut the whole world out
but let you in.

36:31.643 --> 36:33.109
What, did you find out
about Laura?

36:33.111 --> 36:35.178
Saw an opportunity to get
yourself a little payday?

better.
