WEBVTT

00:01.435 --> 00:05.806
* He met Marmalade
down in old New Orleans

00:05.839 --> 00:09.277
* Struttin' her stuff
on the street

00:09.310 --> 00:13.114
* She said, "Hello, hey, Joe,
you wanna give it a go?"

00:13.147 --> 00:17.051
* Oh, gitchi gitchi
ya-ya da-da *

00:17.085 --> 00:20.521
Damn, I feel bad for the chump
who has to follow her.

00:20.554 --> 00:22.090
Ooh, it says here
you're up next.

00:23.324 --> 00:25.326
Switch with me?
No!

00:25.359 --> 00:30.898
* Creole Lady Marmala-a-a-de

00:31.865 --> 00:33.767
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

00:39.607 --> 00:41.008
(CHUCKLES)

00:41.442 --> 00:42.810
Oh, sweaty.

00:44.412 --> 00:46.780
I, um, was hoping
to follow someone

00:46.814 --> 00:49.417
a little less impressive,
like maybe my wife.

00:49.450 --> 00:50.684
Thanks, sweetie.

00:52.853 --> 00:55.689
(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
* Everybody dance now

00:57.558 --> 01:00.060
Not this song.
Maybe you should
get some air.

01:00.094 --> 01:01.495
Hey, babe, you want me
to come with you?

01:01.529 --> 01:03.431
No, no.
Just let her go.

01:04.265 --> 01:05.833
What's that about?

01:05.866 --> 01:08.269
Okay. Damona doesn't like
to talk about it,

01:08.302 --> 01:11.305
but back in high school,
she sang with her
church choir.

01:11.339 --> 01:13.374
They were pretty good, too...

01:13.407 --> 01:16.810
so good that a music producer
brought her into his studio

01:16.844 --> 01:19.180
to record on the very
dance album

01:19.213 --> 01:21.715
that Ken is "singing"
as we speak.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.517
(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
* Work me all night

01:23.551 --> 01:26.287
(NORMAL VOICE)
* Come on, let's sweat

01:26.320 --> 01:27.555
* Baby

01:30.891 --> 01:33.261
Wait. Everybody Dance Now
has Damona's voice?

01:33.294 --> 01:35.062
Yes, but when the video
came out,

01:35.095 --> 01:37.198
they had someone else
lip-sync her part,

01:37.231 --> 01:39.032
and she never
got credit for it.

01:39.066 --> 01:40.534
That's messed up.

01:40.568 --> 01:44.172
So, I lost my virginity
to Damona's voice?

01:45.673 --> 01:48.509
Pat, that song came out
when you were in your 30s.

01:48.542 --> 01:50.411
Huh? What?
Nothing. What?

01:52.380 --> 01:54.148
They owe her recognition.

01:54.182 --> 01:57.185
Trust me...
she has no interest
in revisiting the matter.

01:57.218 --> 01:59.520
It's better not to open
old wounds...

01:59.553 --> 02:01.455
unless they need
to be drained.

02:01.489 --> 02:04.091
Sorry. That's the nurse
in me talking.

02:10.764 --> 02:14.235
Everyone, I'd like you to meet
Erin, our newest intern.

02:14.268 --> 02:16.704
She's a member of the AOA
Medical Honor Society

02:16.737 --> 02:18.372
and Ken's replacement
if all goes well.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.942
I'm kidding
'cause I'm bored.

02:23.110 --> 02:24.445
Hey, Erin.

02:24.478 --> 02:27.648
I am Dr. Ken Park,
and I'll be your
attending physician.

02:27.681 --> 02:29.283
Well, except for the hour
every day

02:29.317 --> 02:30.884
where I'm a
"pretending physician"

02:30.918 --> 02:32.486
and I sneak off to my office
for a nap.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.422
(LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY)

02:37.258 --> 02:40.794
Oh, I was so nervous to meet
you, but you're hilarious!

02:40.828 --> 02:43.197
Well, congrats.
You nailed your
first diagnosis.

02:43.231 --> 02:45.333
Ohh!
(LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY)

02:49.237 --> 02:50.771
Oh, are you out of
your Coke Zero?

02:50.804 --> 02:51.972
Can I get you a fresh one?

02:52.005 --> 02:54.208
(GOOFY VOICE)
Um, zero objection.

02:54.242 --> 02:56.009
Oh, stop! (LAUGHS)

02:57.645 --> 02:59.580
Ahh.
Pay attention, you two.

02:59.613 --> 03:00.981
You guys can learn
something from her.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.451
Uh, Dr. Ken,
I think she likes you.

03:04.084 --> 03:05.386
What?
Yeah.

03:05.419 --> 03:07.955
She was on you like a bad
haircut on a Norwegian dude.

03:07.988 --> 03:11.325
Mm-hmm. Come on.
She was flirting up a storm.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.495
Aw, what are you
talking about?

03:15.329 --> 03:16.564
Here, Dr. Park.

03:17.998 --> 03:22.503
So, what's the first pearl
of wisdom you have for me?

03:22.536 --> 03:24.505
Oh, um, the first, uh...

03:28.409 --> 03:30.711
...married pearl
of wisdom.

03:32.513 --> 03:35.749
Um, uh, the patients
are important.

03:35.783 --> 03:38.252
The patients are important.
Very interesting.

03:38.286 --> 03:40.754
Um, oh, yeah.
Um, speaking of which,

03:40.788 --> 03:42.456
uh, this patient,
Mr. Miller...

03:42.490 --> 03:44.224
Mmm.
Um,

03:44.258 --> 03:48.296
has pseudohyponatremia due
to his high triglycerides.

03:48.329 --> 03:49.563
Yes. Right.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.865
So, by trying to correct
his sodium levels,

03:51.899 --> 03:53.066
he could get worse.

03:53.100 --> 03:56.069
Treat the patient,
not the numbers.

03:56.103 --> 03:58.572
That's exactly right.
Very astute.

03:58.606 --> 04:01.875
That means so much
coming from you.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.243
Thank you!

04:06.347 --> 04:08.316
Uh, oh,
what's over there?

04:25.265 --> 04:26.834
Can I help you?

04:26.867 --> 04:28.869
How was date with Jae
last night?

04:28.902 --> 04:30.270
Dish, girl!

04:31.639 --> 04:33.941
Sorry.
That's kind of personal.

04:33.974 --> 04:35.509
But I'm the one
who set you up.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.278
Okay, fine.

04:38.879 --> 04:41.482
I...really liked him.

04:41.515 --> 04:42.650
See?

04:42.683 --> 04:43.784
And you were like,

04:43.817 --> 04:46.253
"Traditional Korean setup,
not for me!"

04:47.555 --> 04:48.822
I know.
I was wrong.

04:48.856 --> 04:51.392
He's super nice,
and I thought we had
a great time.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.894
But he hasn't texted me
since, nothing,

04:53.927 --> 04:56.096
not even the three dots that
means he's writing something,

04:56.129 --> 04:57.965
then deciding not
to send it.

04:57.998 --> 04:59.600
I'll talk
to his grandfather,

04:59.633 --> 05:02.035
find out why he's not
making dots.

05:03.471 --> 05:06.206
No. Don't do that.
I can't have this getting
back to Jae.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.308
Okay.

05:08.342 --> 05:12.112
Although, if you should happen
into his grandpa's barbershop

05:12.145 --> 05:13.947
and secretly get
some intel...

05:14.948 --> 05:17.485
Okay.

05:17.518 --> 05:20.654
But be discreet.
I don't want Jae to think that
I think about what he thinks.

05:20.688 --> 05:23.824
But the problem is,
I just got my hair cut.

05:23.857 --> 05:26.159
Going back again
will raise suspicion.

05:27.495 --> 05:29.397
Good morning,
two Parks most likely

05:29.430 --> 05:31.365
to survive
a nuclear apocalypse.

05:33.033 --> 05:35.068
Dave, you need haircut?

05:35.102 --> 05:37.738
I could stand to get
my ears lowered.

05:37.771 --> 05:40.508
After school,
we go to barbershop.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.810
Fortune favors the bold.
Let's do it.

05:48.882 --> 05:50.618
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Allison,

05:50.651 --> 05:52.019
we got to talk.

05:52.052 --> 05:53.821
I ran all the way here.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.355
Well, I jogged
the last part.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.425
And then I walked.

05:58.926 --> 06:01.028
Is that hallway uphill?

06:03.063 --> 06:04.965
I think my new intern's
flirting with me.

06:05.332 --> 06:06.534
Really?

06:06.567 --> 06:08.436
Just like
Jessica Alba was

06:08.469 --> 06:10.904
when we saw her
at that farmers' market?

06:10.938 --> 06:15.042
Worse, Allison.
She thinks I'm funny,
and she touched my arm.

06:15.075 --> 06:18.546
Alba just asked me to stop
yelling at that apple vendor
in front of her kids.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.314
I'm sure
she's not flirting.

06:21.348 --> 06:23.016
She sounds like
a young intern

06:23.050 --> 06:24.918
who's impressed
by her attending.

06:24.952 --> 06:26.654
You know,
intern goggles.

06:26.687 --> 06:28.922
Wait. So,
you're cool with this?

06:28.956 --> 06:31.592
Ken, I know you love me,
and I trust you.

06:31.625 --> 06:34.462
You're the one who, by nature,
is extremely jealous.

06:34.495 --> 06:36.229
Remember the tailspin
you went into

06:36.263 --> 06:37.631
when you met
my med-school ex, Kevin?

06:37.665 --> 06:40.434
Ah, any excuse
to bring him up.

06:42.703 --> 06:44.472
I'm not jealous.

06:44.505 --> 06:46.974
You know this.
You don't have to worry.

06:47.007 --> 06:49.577
(SIGHS) Thanks.

06:49.610 --> 06:50.978
It'll be a lot easier
with Erin

06:51.011 --> 06:53.847
if I don't have to
feel guilty about
cracking killer jokes.

06:53.881 --> 06:55.348
(CHUCKLES)
Ken, listen to me.

06:55.382 --> 06:57.685
You never have to worry
about cracking killer jokes.

06:59.052 --> 07:00.588
Thanks, Al.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.657
No, I wasn't...

07:03.691 --> 07:04.958
Whatever.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.897
Hey, Baby Cakes.

07:09.930 --> 07:12.900
Mm. I should not have used
Damona's nickname for you.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.301
Anywho,
Pooh Bear is at lunch.

07:14.334 --> 07:16.436
Ugh! I'm sorry. You guys just
have such good ones!

07:16.470 --> 07:17.871
I actually want
to talk to you.

07:17.905 --> 07:19.940
Ooh! Intrigue.
What's up?

07:20.808 --> 07:22.543
So, I Googled
C+C Music Factory,

07:22.576 --> 07:25.245
and it turns out
they're playing at
Agave Springs Casino tonight.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.581
I want to get Damona there
so she can confront them.

07:27.615 --> 07:30.083
You just don't get it.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.119
Pat, do you imagine
that Damona being pushed

07:32.152 --> 07:33.787
into something
would go really well?

07:33.821 --> 07:35.623
Ah, give me a second.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.891
Oh, God, no!

07:37.925 --> 07:39.092
No.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.062
She's strong-willed,

07:42.095 --> 07:43.597
and when she feels
pressured into
doing something,

07:43.631 --> 07:44.932
she backs the other way.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.199
Yes. Like a stray dog.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.168
You try to corner her,
she'll lash out,

07:48.201 --> 07:49.970
although if you can get
hold of a slice of pizza,

07:50.003 --> 07:51.038
sometimes you can just...

07:51.071 --> 07:53.240
You know, I think
I'm getting off topic.

07:53.273 --> 07:55.142
Look, I know what
she thinks she wants,

07:55.175 --> 07:57.010
but that's obviously
a defense mechanism.

07:57.044 --> 07:58.378
Every time
she hears that song,

07:58.411 --> 08:00.447
she's gonna feel the way
she did last night.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.982
Don't you have something
in your past

08:02.015 --> 08:03.483
that you wish
you'd confronted?

08:03.517 --> 08:05.185
Jessica Greenberg.

08:06.353 --> 08:08.188
(VOICE BREAKING)
And I'm gonna leave
it at that.

08:09.557 --> 08:11.058
You may be onto something.

08:11.091 --> 08:12.660
I know when I got divorced,

08:12.693 --> 08:14.962
I asked my ex-wife
when she stopped loving me,

08:14.995 --> 08:17.865
and she told me that
she never loved me.

08:17.898 --> 08:19.466
And that closure felt great.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.136
Still, Damona is never
going to agree to go.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.772
Not if she knows
the reason.

08:24.805 --> 08:26.974
But if she thinks it's just
a fun night out, she will.

08:27.608 --> 08:28.976
Well, it's worth a shot,

08:29.009 --> 08:30.711
but bring a slice of pizza
just in case.

08:35.415 --> 08:38.185
Hey, Dr. Park,
I was going over
today's calendar...

08:38.218 --> 08:39.519
Oh, speaking of which,
did you hear

08:39.553 --> 08:40.954
about the two guys who stole
a calendar?

08:40.988 --> 08:42.222
They each got six months.

08:42.255 --> 08:43.857
(BOTH LAUGH)

08:46.226 --> 08:49.196
He has been telling
that same damn joke
for three whole years,

08:49.229 --> 08:51.164
and nobody
has ever laughed.

08:52.566 --> 08:55.002
I guess he was due.

08:55.035 --> 08:58.105
Are you okay with this?
You're not jealous
or, you know...

08:58.138 --> 09:00.507
Me? No. (LAUGHS)

09:01.174 --> 09:02.475
No, no, no.

09:02.509 --> 09:04.144
(BOTH LAUGHING)

09:04.544 --> 09:06.013
No, no.

09:08.315 --> 09:09.416
No.

09:10.417 --> 09:11.919
Crazy.
You're crazy, man.

09:12.786 --> 09:14.054
Hi.

09:14.087 --> 09:15.623
(BOTH LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY)

09:17.357 --> 09:18.859
I'm Allison, Ken's wife!

09:19.559 --> 09:21.494
Oh, hi!
I'm Erin.

09:21.528 --> 09:22.796
Nice to meet you.

09:22.830 --> 09:24.798
Oh, nice to meet you.
Your husband
has been amazing.

09:24.832 --> 09:26.166
You are so lucky.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.735
Yep.
I won the lottery.

09:27.768 --> 09:28.936
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

09:28.969 --> 09:31.438
Oh, honey, you won't believe
what Erin did this morning.

09:31.471 --> 09:33.540
She made a brilliant
breakthrough on
this patient...

09:33.573 --> 09:34.808
Mr. White.

09:34.842 --> 09:36.043
All I did was suggest
an experimental

09:36.076 --> 09:39.079
treatment protocol
from a study I published
in JAMA.

09:39.112 --> 09:41.381
As a med student, dude!
As a med student!

09:42.415 --> 09:44.351
And already it's helping
his symptoms.

09:44.384 --> 09:46.586
Right, because
the patient, uh...

09:46.620 --> 09:50.123
when he was feeling the, uh...
Well, his symptoms do show...

09:51.558 --> 09:52.760
I went to med school.

09:52.793 --> 09:53.927
Oh.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.796
I mean, I didn't publish
anything, per se, but...

09:55.829 --> 09:57.064
Modest.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.531
She was written up in
the med-school newsletter.

09:58.565 --> 09:59.933
Oh, no, no,
we don't have to...

09:59.967 --> 10:01.334
Yeah. She won
a hot-dog-eating contest.

10:03.303 --> 10:04.972
Wow.
Uh-huh. Thank you.

10:05.005 --> 10:07.007
Yeah. She won a hat.
Mm-hmm.

10:08.742 --> 10:11.745
So, published at 21?

10:11.779 --> 10:13.546
Actually, I was 20.
Ah!

10:14.147 --> 10:15.615
Nice to meet you.

10:24.591 --> 10:26.193
Oh, hello there.

10:27.360 --> 10:31.231
You know, over my teeny, tiny,
non-hot-dog lunch,

10:31.264 --> 10:34.301
I was pondering that case you
and Erin were talking about.

10:34.334 --> 10:37.504
I recalled a study in Lancet
that demonstrated,

10:37.537 --> 10:39.707
if you use a low-dose
salicylate,

10:39.740 --> 10:42.042
it would have a more favorable
side-effect profile

10:42.075 --> 10:45.278
than the anti-coagulant
therapy Erin advocates,
so...

10:46.947 --> 10:49.182
But the patient's allergic
to aspirin.

10:50.617 --> 10:52.920
Oh. So, Erin's thing, then.

10:54.254 --> 10:55.689
Dr. Park,
could you sign this?

10:55.723 --> 10:57.357
Oh, you want
my autograph, huh?

10:57.390 --> 10:59.059
I get that a lot.
(SQUEALING)

10:59.092 --> 11:00.493
(BOTH LAUGH)

11:01.829 --> 11:03.296
That is so funny!

11:03.330 --> 11:04.597
(LAUGHS)

11:04.631 --> 11:05.933
(LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY)

11:10.170 --> 11:11.538
"Autograph."

11:11.571 --> 11:13.406
(CHUCKLES)

11:13.440 --> 11:15.442
(LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY)
So funny!

11:15.475 --> 11:16.710
Oh, man.

11:24.351 --> 11:25.585
How'd the barbershop go?

11:25.618 --> 11:26.754
Pretty good.

11:26.787 --> 11:29.790
Jung-Do sure knows his way
around the old melon.

11:29.823 --> 11:33.761
Not the haircut.
I'm talking about Grandpa
getting intel on Jae.

11:33.794 --> 11:36.830
I get the feeling
I've been used as a pawn
in a game of love,

11:36.864 --> 11:38.832
and I'll have no further
part in it!

11:40.934 --> 11:43.470
So, what did you find out?

11:43.503 --> 11:45.873
Good news, bad news.

11:47.407 --> 11:49.009
The bad news is,

11:50.210 --> 11:52.412
Jae's not, uh...

11:53.213 --> 11:55.015
It's okay, Grandpa.
I get it.

11:58.251 --> 11:59.887
Man, I really liked him.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.688
And he should like you.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.157
You're smart, beautiful,

12:04.191 --> 12:05.525
good at bocce ball.

12:08.095 --> 12:09.529
His loss.

12:09.562 --> 12:10.764
Thanks.

12:11.865 --> 12:12.933
Wait.

12:12.966 --> 12:14.434
What's the good news?

12:14.467 --> 12:16.904
Oh!
Dave's haircut, comped!

12:21.474 --> 12:24.244
Somebody has got to teach me
how to play craps

12:24.277 --> 12:26.046
'cause once I learn, baby...

12:26.713 --> 12:28.215
What the hell?

12:29.616 --> 12:31.451
Oh, my God.
What a coincidence.

12:32.485 --> 12:34.121
You set me up?

12:34.154 --> 12:35.388
I'm sorry, babe.
I just wanted to...

12:35.422 --> 12:37.224
I can't believe you guys.

12:37.257 --> 12:40.060
Baby, just wait a...
Just give her some space.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.962
He's right, although
we should probably

12:41.995 --> 12:43.530
keep her in our
line of sight.

12:44.397 --> 12:45.866
She does have
the car keys.

12:47.400 --> 12:48.735
I got her.

12:56.910 --> 12:58.211
ALLISON: Hey, stud.

13:01.849 --> 13:03.416
Hey.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.085
Where are the kids?

13:05.118 --> 13:07.287
I sent them
to see a movie-film.

13:09.689 --> 13:11.358
And my dad?

13:11.391 --> 13:13.226
Grocery shopping for me.

13:13.260 --> 13:15.863
It's just us.
Whatever are we gonna do?

13:19.666 --> 13:21.001
Oops.

13:21.034 --> 13:23.036
I guess my shoulder
wants out.

13:23.070 --> 13:24.471
(BOTH LAUGH)

13:28.775 --> 13:30.443
I forgot the grocery list.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.712
Okay, then.
Thanks. Weird. Bye.

13:32.745 --> 13:34.747
Tomatoes?
That's a waste of money.

13:34.781 --> 13:36.283
You should grow your own.

13:36.316 --> 13:37.851
Good idea.
Go buy dirt.

13:42.890 --> 13:45.658
Where were we?
Oh, yeah. "Oops."

13:49.596 --> 13:51.731
I think the robe is sticking
to your shoulder sweat.

13:52.299 --> 13:54.067
Yeah? You like that?

13:57.804 --> 13:59.672
You're gonna hurt yourself,
Allison.

13:59.706 --> 14:02.375
(LAUGHS) You're so funny.
Take off your belt.

14:02.409 --> 14:03.944
Oh!

14:03.977 --> 14:06.980
This never happens
so easily.
What's going on here?

14:07.014 --> 14:08.181
I can't resist you.

14:08.215 --> 14:10.884
You're just so hot
and chiseled.

14:10.918 --> 14:13.186
Yes, I am, but still.

14:14.187 --> 14:17.290
Fine. I guess I am jealous
of Erin, okay?

14:17.324 --> 14:18.525
What?

14:18.558 --> 14:21.728
The rational side of me
knows there's no issue,

14:21.761 --> 14:23.897
but the cave-lady side
felt threatened.

14:23.931 --> 14:25.899
This is mostly her work.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.701
You must think
I'm pathetic.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.971
No.

14:31.004 --> 14:34.274
I think you're amazing,
beautiful, and brilliant.

14:34.307 --> 14:36.009
Well, you have
to say that.

14:36.043 --> 14:38.211
Doesn't make it
any less true.

14:38.245 --> 14:39.812
You got nothing
to worry about.

14:39.846 --> 14:41.949
Look at me.
I'm a hot mess.

14:41.982 --> 14:44.251
I got the posture
of a question mark,

14:44.284 --> 14:45.652
and I'm needy,

14:45.685 --> 14:47.754
and I have the temperament
of a colicky baby.

14:47.787 --> 14:49.489
Oh, my God.
Please don't leave me.

14:49.522 --> 14:50.757
Aw.

14:50.790 --> 14:53.093
I probably won't.

14:53.126 --> 14:56.429
I mean, hey,
you get my crazy,
and you still love me for it.

14:56.463 --> 14:58.098
Nobody else in the world
would be able

14:58.131 --> 14:59.399
to make me
as happy as you do.

14:59.432 --> 15:00.934
Really?
(CHUCKLING) Of course.

15:00.968 --> 15:02.035
Aww.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.905
Thanks.
I feel better.

15:05.939 --> 15:09.242
And, you know,
we still have the house
to ourselves.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.744
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

15:13.080 --> 15:15.115
You want tuna
in water or oil?

15:15.148 --> 15:16.416
BOTH: Go!

15:16.916 --> 15:17.985
Oil.

15:23.723 --> 15:25.458
Hey.

15:25.492 --> 15:27.494
Can we join you,
or are you in like a

15:27.527 --> 15:29.562
"throw hot coffee in the-face"
kind of mood?

15:34.267 --> 15:35.935
This could be a trick.

15:39.039 --> 15:40.907
Look, babe, I'm sorry.

15:41.408 --> 15:43.843
It's just that...

15:43.876 --> 15:45.912
you're so talented
and you have such
a beautiful voice.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.515
We just wanted you to get
the credit you deserve.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.417
You know...

15:50.450 --> 15:52.685
I lost my virginity
to your voice.

15:57.224 --> 15:58.625
You talk.

16:00.193 --> 16:03.163
Listen, when I was younger,

16:03.196 --> 16:05.198
I wanted to be a singer
more than anything,

16:05.232 --> 16:08.301
but being replaced
in that video showed
me how brutal

16:08.335 --> 16:09.669
the music business can be.

16:09.702 --> 16:13.840
So, really, guys,
I actually have everything
I've ever wanted,

16:13.873 --> 16:15.875
a job that makes
a difference,

16:15.908 --> 16:18.211
an amazing boyfriend,

16:18.245 --> 16:21.481
the best, most caring
friends in the world.

16:21.514 --> 16:23.483
I wouldn't change a thing.

16:23.516 --> 16:27.654
I mean, the last thing
I need is to go back to
a time when...

16:27.687 --> 16:29.756
Oh, you have got
to be kidding me!

16:32.092 --> 16:33.593
Oh, oh,
let's get out of here.

16:33.626 --> 16:35.028
Yeah, okay, so, what did
everybody have?

16:35.062 --> 16:36.296
Was it just Damona's cup...
You know what?

16:36.329 --> 16:37.597
I'm just gonna pay
for everything.

16:42.202 --> 16:43.303
Wait.

16:49.642 --> 16:51.444
Excuse me.

16:51.478 --> 16:53.613
That's my voice you used.

16:53.646 --> 16:55.282
I don't know what
you're talking about, sweetie.

16:55.315 --> 16:57.650
Yeah, you do, sweetie.

16:57.684 --> 16:59.886
Look, if you got
some kind of beef,
you should call our lawyer.

16:59.919 --> 17:02.455
It's not about the money.
It's about what's right.

17:02.489 --> 17:05.458
And you guys can ignore
what I'm saying,

17:05.492 --> 17:07.360
but you can't ignore this.

17:07.394 --> 17:09.562
* Everybody dance now!

17:11.664 --> 17:13.500
Big deal.
You can sing a hook.

17:19.339 --> 17:23.810
* Itchi gitchi ya-ya da-da

17:23.843 --> 17:29.015
* Oh-oh-oh, itchi gitchi
ya-ya he-e-e-re

17:29.048 --> 17:31.318
Okay, so, things are starting
to get weird.

17:32.552 --> 17:36.356
* Mocha-choca-lata ya-ya

17:36.389 --> 17:41.161
* Creole Lady Marmalade

17:43.062 --> 17:48.368
* Creole Lady
Marmala-a-a-de

17:50.203 --> 17:52.071
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

17:52.939 --> 17:54.807
* I say, ohh, ohh, ohh

17:56.309 --> 17:59.546
* I say, ohh,
ohh, ohh, whoa *

17:59.579 --> 18:01.348
Okay, baby.
Ah. Oh! Whoa!

18:01.381 --> 18:02.649
Oh, my God!

18:02.682 --> 18:04.284
(LAUGHING)
That felt so good!

18:04.317 --> 18:07.019
You guys, maybe I really
did need closure.

18:07.053 --> 18:09.189
Thank you so much.

18:09.222 --> 18:11.224
Now, somebody teach me
how to play some craps!

18:11.258 --> 18:12.492
Come on.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.363
(DOORBELL RINGS)

18:21.168 --> 18:22.902
Jae.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.104
What are you doing here?
You break your thumbs?

18:25.138 --> 18:26.839
That why you didn't text
my granddaughter?

18:28.275 --> 18:29.642
Easy, Tiger.

18:29.676 --> 18:30.943
Let's give these kids
some space.

18:30.977 --> 18:32.545
But he didn't
even make dots!

18:32.579 --> 18:33.780
Okay.

18:36.849 --> 18:38.218
Come on in.

18:41.053 --> 18:42.222
Hey, uh...

18:43.623 --> 18:45.758
I had a great time
with you the other night,

18:45.792 --> 18:47.960
and...and I haven't been able
to stop thinking about you.

18:47.994 --> 18:50.197
But then why haven't
I heard from you?

18:50.230 --> 18:51.731
My family has gotten
so involved,

18:51.764 --> 18:53.500
I've been too nervous
to pursue anything.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.368
My mom even used that app
to combine our pictures

18:55.402 --> 18:57.604
and see what our baby
would look like.
It's her screen saver now.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.138
(CHUCKLES)

19:00.307 --> 19:02.575
I was nervous
about you, too.

19:02.609 --> 19:04.977
It was weird to be set up
by my grandpa.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.849
But I'm glad I was.

19:09.882 --> 19:12.885
So, you wouldn't feel like
you were only seeing me
out of family obligation?

19:13.653 --> 19:14.787
Definitely not.

19:24.331 --> 19:26.799
So, what do you say we keep
our families out of this?

19:26.833 --> 19:27.934
Absolutely.

19:27.967 --> 19:29.302
(CHUCKLES)

19:31.304 --> 19:33.039
Okay, that's enough
for now.

19:35.308 --> 19:36.443
Glad you came by.

19:36.476 --> 19:38.478
So am I.
I'll text you.

19:38.511 --> 19:39.879
And not just dots!

19:41.013 --> 19:42.415
Actual text.

19:44.150 --> 19:45.218
Bye.

19:54.894 --> 19:56.028
Oh. Excuse me.

19:56.062 --> 19:57.697
Dr. Park,
do you have a sec?

19:57.730 --> 19:58.831
Sure. What's up?

19:58.865 --> 20:00.267
I just wanted
to let you know

20:00.300 --> 20:01.834
that today is going to be
my last day.

20:02.168 --> 20:03.202
Oh.

20:03.903 --> 20:06.539
Oh. Right.

20:06.573 --> 20:08.241
I think it's for the best,
you know,

20:08.275 --> 20:11.210
given my situation
and where I am in my life.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.748
What are you talking about?

20:15.782 --> 20:18.551
You know, how you,
when it comes to me,

20:18.585 --> 20:21.321
have been kind of like
(CHUCKLING) you know...

20:21.354 --> 20:23.122
Wait.
Why are you leaving?

20:23.155 --> 20:24.891
Oh, it's the last day
of my rotation.

20:24.924 --> 20:25.958
Oh!

20:26.759 --> 20:28.127
Oh.

20:28.160 --> 20:29.929
So, it's, it's not
because of the...

20:30.763 --> 20:32.765
(FLIRTATIOUS GIGGLING)

20:34.000 --> 20:36.168
Or the... (PURRS)

20:38.671 --> 20:40.940
I don't know what
you're talking about.

20:40.973 --> 20:42.609
Right. Sorry. No.
I, um...

20:43.976 --> 20:45.878
Yeah, I think I misread
something.

20:47.614 --> 20:48.715
Take care, Erin.

20:49.482 --> 20:50.683
Thanks.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.054
Dr. Park?

20:56.989 --> 20:58.625
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

21:01.227 --> 21:02.595
Never mind.

21:03.696 --> 21:05.565
Thanks for everything.

21:08.468 --> 21:10.303
What a confusing person.

21:19.312 --> 21:20.747
What was that for?

21:20.780 --> 21:22.148
For eating hot dogs,

21:22.181 --> 21:24.984
having sweaty shoulders,
and being perfect.

21:26.553 --> 21:27.920
Oh. (CHUCKLES)
