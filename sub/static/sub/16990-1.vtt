01:44.375 --> 01:46.165
OUR LOVERS

03:30.416 --> 03:31.416
Hello.

03:32.166 --> 03:33.332
Can I help you?

03:37.833 --> 03:38.833
Yes.

03:42.416 --> 03:43.624
Will I come back?

03:44.750 --> 03:46.915
Yes, give me a minute.

03:52.458 --> 03:53.749
Got any brandy?

03:54.166 --> 03:56.124
Sure. Which do you want?

03:57.916 --> 03:59.874
I don't know.
I've never tried it.

04:00.916 --> 04:01.957
Hang on.

04:06.291 --> 04:07.874
This is the best I've got.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.207
Try it, and if you like it
I'll give you a glass.

04:21.833 --> 04:22.957
Good, isn't it?

04:25.250 --> 04:26.332
It's Brand A.

04:28.666 --> 04:29.707
Was that a joke?

04:31.208 --> 04:32.499
It sounded better in my head.

04:32.750 --> 04:35.082
- A glass?
- I'd prefer another of these.

04:35.333 --> 04:36.707
Not taking any risks.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.207
Under no circumstances.

04:49.708 --> 04:52.540
- Can I have another?
- You don't want a glass?

04:53.166 --> 04:54.166
No.

04:54.500 --> 04:56.999
I don't know happened.
It was an impulse.

04:57.708 --> 04:58.957
An act of passion?

04:59.541 --> 05:00.624
I think so.

05:01.750 --> 05:02.750
OK.

05:59.083 --> 06:00.083
Hi, there.

06:00.666 --> 06:01.874
Do we know each other?

06:02.250 --> 06:03.290
No.

06:03.833 --> 06:05.374
But I'd like that.

06:05.708 --> 06:08.999
The routine with the brandy was...
promising.

06:09.916 --> 06:10.916
All right.

06:11.750 --> 06:12.832
- I'm...
- No, no!

06:12.958 --> 06:14.957
Don't tell me your name.
I don't want to know.

06:15.833 --> 06:16.833
Why?

06:16.958 --> 06:19.040
I don't want to call you
what everyone does.

06:20.291 --> 06:20.957
Why?

06:21.291 --> 06:23.957
I want to give you a name
that means something to me,

06:24.083 --> 06:26.499
one that only I know and use.

06:27.833 --> 06:28.999
You'll do the same with me.

06:29.416 --> 06:31.332
- Find a name for you?
- Yes.

06:31.791 --> 06:34.165
But not now.
When we know each other better.

06:37.791 --> 06:38.915
Do you think I'm crazy?

06:39.958 --> 06:42.207
- Are you crazy?
- Perhaps.

06:44.083 --> 06:45.083
Does it matter?

06:45.916 --> 06:47.749
My pleasure,
whoever you are.

06:48.125 --> 06:49.125
No, no, no.

06:49.625 --> 06:52.457
- No kisses.
- Of course not. What an idea!

06:52.583 --> 06:54.249
I don't like routine kisses.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.832
- Any questions?
- Yes.

06:58.166 --> 07:00.874
But you'll be disappointed.
They're clichés.

07:01.333 --> 07:02.415
That's flattering.

07:02.750 --> 07:04.540
- Asking clichéd questions?
- No.

07:04.833 --> 07:07.665
We've just met
and you don't want to disappoint me.

07:08.000 --> 07:13.749
The first question is so obvious
I prefer you ask it yourself.

07:15.166 --> 07:17.749
And if my question
isn't what your question was?

07:18.083 --> 07:19.582
I'm sure it will be.

07:19.875 --> 07:20.540
OK,

07:20.750 --> 07:23.249
- but you answer it.
- It's a deal.

07:24.041 --> 07:25.207
Can we shake hands?

07:26.000 --> 07:28.332
Yes, because it means something.

07:33.250 --> 07:34.332
Do I do this often?

07:34.666 --> 07:36.665
- Do what?
- Chat people up like this.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.124
At times,
when you see someone interesting.

07:39.500 --> 07:40.832
- Why you?
- Why me?

07:41.041 --> 07:42.041
Why did I pick you?

07:42.875 --> 07:46.207
You think I'm interesting,
for some reason.

07:46.708 --> 07:47.708
What reason?

07:48.125 --> 07:49.332
You answer that.

07:51.666 --> 07:52.666
Do you like parks?

07:53.500 --> 07:54.790
Yes, I do.

07:55.125 --> 07:57.415
I love going to parks
and watching children play.

07:57.541 --> 08:00.374
Suddenly one child will go up
to another he doesn't know

08:00.750 --> 08:02.582
and just say: "Shall we play?"

08:03.875 --> 08:05.207
And they start playing.

08:05.583 --> 08:07.874
When I saw you, I thought
you'd want to play with me.

08:09.083 --> 08:10.165
Shall we play?

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Sure.

08:12.625 --> 08:13.707
Great!

08:14.416 --> 08:15.416
What'll we play?

08:16.500 --> 08:18.915
That's where
we're different from children.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.165
They want to know
what the game is.

08:21.333 --> 08:24.582
But you and I will find out
while we're playing.

08:25.375 --> 08:26.624
How long does the game last?

08:27.375 --> 08:28.790
Until we're bored.

08:29.291 --> 08:30.291
Any rules?

08:30.541 --> 08:31.832
Yes, there are.

08:32.166 --> 08:34.874
I don't want you
to find out anything about me.

08:35.041 --> 08:39.039
I don't want you to know who I am,
so no Internet and no phones.

08:40.291 --> 08:43.914
But I suppose the idea
is that we'll meet again.

08:44.375 --> 08:45.375
That's the idea.

08:45.750 --> 08:47.665
So how do we arrange it?

08:47.958 --> 08:49.040
We talk.

08:49.541 --> 08:51.332
We set a day, a time, a place.

08:51.541 --> 08:54.707
That's worked for centuries.
It shouldn't fail now.

08:54.916 --> 08:56.915
No, it shouldn't.

08:57.958 --> 08:58.958
Anything else?

08:59.291 --> 09:00.415
Yes.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.415
You like to go slowly.
I don't.

09:03.666 --> 09:06.957
I don't want to waste time.
No beating about the bush.

09:07.125 --> 09:09.790
If I ask you something,
you answer immediately.

09:10.166 --> 09:11.915
And if I don't want to?

09:13.208 --> 09:14.374
Lie to me.

09:15.916 --> 09:19.124
Lying is much more creative
and fun than telling the truth.

09:19.541 --> 09:21.124
I trust lies.

09:21.666 --> 09:25.207
As someone said:
"A lie always tells the truth".

09:25.583 --> 09:26.583
Who said that?

09:26.958 --> 09:28.582
I did, two seconds ago.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.082
Very well.

09:30.375 --> 09:31.499
I'll lie to you.

09:32.291 --> 09:33.624
Any more rules?

09:33.916 --> 09:35.582
Yes, the most important one.

09:36.125 --> 09:39.249
Whatever happens,
don't fall in love with me.

09:39.750 --> 09:40.750
Is it dangerous?

09:41.291 --> 09:42.291
Yes, very.

09:42.958 --> 09:44.374
For me or for you?

09:46.375 --> 09:47.582
I have to go.

09:49.666 --> 09:51.832
So, today is Monday.

10:06.750 --> 10:10.499
In a week's time we'll meet there.
Around this time.

10:10.958 --> 10:11.958
Perfect.

10:13.375 --> 10:15.457
You and I are going to have fun.

10:21.166 --> 10:22.166
A drink?

10:53.208 --> 10:54.790
Cristóbal, are you there?

10:56.000 --> 10:57.207
My dear partner,

10:57.583 --> 10:59.957
we need the Anton Chekov within you.

11:01.416 --> 11:02.749
This is the situation.

11:03.666 --> 11:07.082
In act one, Ditsy and Bozo
are chased by Russian hitmen.

11:07.250 --> 11:08.040
Pure Chekhov.

11:08.166 --> 11:11.415
They think the girls are cops
pretending to be mental retards.

11:11.541 --> 11:13.749
The girls are running away
because they think

11:13.875 --> 11:17.832
the hitmen are in love with them
and the guys are... no, not ugly.

11:18.958 --> 11:20.249
Take it up a level.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.207
I'll ignore that provocation.

11:23.541 --> 11:26.624
What's the dramatic conflict here?

11:27.291 --> 11:30.790
They shake off the hitmen because
a) Ditsy vomits over them

11:30.916 --> 11:34.582
or b) Bozo does one of her farts
and leaves them unconscious.

11:35.125 --> 11:36.957
Not an easy decision.

11:37.333 --> 11:39.249
If it were, any moron could make it.

11:39.416 --> 11:42.374
- Vomit or a fart.
- That is the question.

11:45.208 --> 11:49.832
Ditsy and Bozo.

11:51.416 --> 11:53.207
A girl chatted me up today.

11:55.458 --> 11:57.457
- Seriously?
- Yes.

11:58.458 --> 12:00.624
- Are you sure?
- I think so.

12:01.125 --> 12:02.332
- Ugly?
- No.

12:04.750 --> 12:05.874
Up a level?

12:07.208 --> 12:08.332
Stop provoking me.

12:09.291 --> 12:12.874
Sorry, I mean, very ugly,
monstrous, hair-raising?

12:13.000 --> 12:15.915
No, just the opposite.
She was really nice.

12:17.208 --> 12:22.374
Remember what I told you
I'd thought of doing and you said

12:22.583 --> 12:24.332
- I shouldn't do it?
- You did it?

12:25.166 --> 12:26.166
No.

12:28.583 --> 12:29.583
You did it.

12:45.166 --> 12:46.332
You know,

12:46.583 --> 12:50.332
you can combine intellectual
brilliance with such pure imbecility

12:54.500 --> 12:56.332
that it has me fascinated.

12:58.625 --> 13:00.957
The thing is, if I hadn't done it,

13:01.083 --> 13:03.707
I wouldn't have been
where the girl who chatted me up

13:03.958 --> 13:05.165
chatted me up.

13:05.958 --> 13:07.040
What's her name?

13:08.208 --> 13:09.957
- She didn't say.
- Of course.

13:10.250 --> 13:13.624
You can just call her
"the girl who chatted me up".

13:13.833 --> 13:16.207
- I didn't tell her mine.
- Excellent.

13:16.375 --> 13:20.374
I mean, she can just call you
"the guy I chatted up".

13:26.708 --> 13:28.665
She wants us
to give each other new names

13:28.833 --> 13:30.082
when we know each other better.

13:31.291 --> 13:32.874
You know she could be
fucking insane?

13:33.208 --> 13:36.207
Yes, or what you ayatollahs
in film theory call...

13:36.375 --> 13:39.165
- A Manic Pixie Dream Girl.
- ...a Manic Pixie Dream Girl.

13:39.416 --> 13:42.415
So, your life is in chaos
and you decide to throw in a lunatic

13:42.541 --> 13:43.957
to really fuck it up, right?

13:44.666 --> 13:45.790
She may not be that crazy.

13:47.708 --> 13:48.708
Take that!

13:52.625 --> 13:56.749
Well, I don't think she'll get
the Nobel Prize for Sanity.

13:57.250 --> 13:58.999
But you can try to screw her.

13:59.625 --> 14:01.957
A quick tumble
could add some light to all that...

14:02.916 --> 14:03.916
darkness.

14:04.208 --> 14:07.082
- One thing I haven't said.
- Oh, God. About what?

14:07.500 --> 14:09.582
About the Manic Pixie Dream Girl.

14:09.833 --> 14:11.499
Has it got
anything to do with Maria?

14:18.125 --> 14:19.125
No.

14:19.625 --> 14:20.874
Yes, it has.

14:21.541 --> 14:22.665
What would happen

14:22.958 --> 14:25.624
if while they were escaping
from the Russian hitmen,

14:25.875 --> 14:30.457
Ditsy and Bozo bump their heads
together and swap personalities?

14:31.125 --> 14:33.415
Ditsy becomes Bozo
and Bozo, Ditsy?

14:33.750 --> 14:34.750
It's an idea.

14:35.083 --> 14:36.124
I like it.

14:36.250 --> 14:40.040
I like it because
if Ditsy vomits and Bozo farts

14:40.875 --> 14:43.124
now Ditsy would fart
and Bozo would vomit!

14:43.708 --> 14:44.708
High comedy.

14:45.125 --> 14:47.249
Careful, we don't want
to get too sophisticated.

14:47.416 --> 14:48.540
- I'd rather die.
- Yes.

14:50.041 --> 14:52.665
- I'm going for a shower.
- Yes, you've earned it.

14:52.791 --> 14:54.249
I'm going to explore this line.

14:57.541 --> 14:59.457
Fuck, I love writing!

15:06.958 --> 15:08.582
One week later...

15:26.666 --> 15:30.790
Hello.

15:31.750 --> 15:32.957
Been here long?

15:34.000 --> 15:35.165
Half an hour.

15:36.833 --> 15:39.624
But don't worry.
I like waiting.

15:40.500 --> 15:42.957
- I could come back later.
- I'm serious.

15:43.125 --> 15:46.374
I think of all the stupid things
I don't have time to think about.

15:47.041 --> 15:50.665
By "stupid things", you mean
the things you really care about?

15:51.833 --> 15:53.207
Probably.

15:53.875 --> 15:56.249
Look, this is
our first official date.

15:56.375 --> 15:58.540
Are you going to do
a Paulo Coelho on me?

16:00.250 --> 16:02.082
Don't play with fire!

16:03.500 --> 16:04.749
What can I get you?

16:06.500 --> 16:07.957
Why this excess?

16:08.791 --> 16:11.249
Let's be daring.
We'll drink from a glass!

16:12.083 --> 16:14.874
I'll have the same,
and to hell with the consequences!

16:18.625 --> 16:22.290
Even though you compare me with
Paulo Coelho, I'm glad you came.

16:22.875 --> 16:24.332
Did you think I wouldn't?

16:24.541 --> 16:26.165
Wasn't that possible?

16:27.208 --> 16:30.082
No. In fact,
I was looking forward to today.

16:30.333 --> 16:32.165
Why? Do you like me?

16:33.541 --> 16:37.249
- Is that a trick question?
- Like almost all of mine.

16:38.958 --> 16:41.499
Then I'll give you a trick answer.

16:42.125 --> 16:45.499
How could I not like you?
You're a classic male fantasy.

16:46.083 --> 16:50.290
An attractive, funny, intelligent,
slightly crazy girl

16:50.708 --> 16:53.790
who stirs up a bored man
with her passion for life.

16:54.291 --> 16:55.540
Are you a bored man?

16:55.958 --> 16:58.415
No. I said that
so you'd work at it.

16:58.916 --> 17:01.290
Girls love redeeming
men with problems.

17:01.875 --> 17:04.249
- You don't say!
- Especially tough guys,

17:04.665 --> 17:06.249
bad boys, cretins...

17:08.625 --> 17:11.374
This is more promising
than the brandy routine. Go on.

17:11.790 --> 17:14.749
Someone should tell
the tough guys and bad boys

17:14.875 --> 17:15.957
why they score with girls.

17:17.250 --> 17:18.332
Don't stop now.

17:19.040 --> 17:22.332
They think you melt
when you see them acting cocky

17:22.625 --> 17:26.332
but really your maternal instinct
sees through their disguise.

17:27.750 --> 17:30.207
- And we see the inner child?
- Exactly.

17:30.333 --> 17:34.040
The timid, insecure child
trying to overcome his fear of girls

17:34.208 --> 17:36.208
by pretending to be
the nasty hero of a nasty film.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.374
You feel a tenderness for them
and you sleep with them.

17:39.916 --> 17:41.124
You give them the prize.

17:43.166 --> 17:44.999
And that's why
we like bad-ass guys?

17:45.500 --> 17:48.874
Their inner child
arouses your maternal instinct.

17:49.458 --> 17:50.458
I see.

17:50.958 --> 17:53.040
So it's kind of like incest.

17:53.375 --> 17:56.874
U.I.I.
Unconscious Incestuous Impulses.

17:57.875 --> 17:59.624
This is the first time
I've verbalized it.

17:59.958 --> 18:03.040
Yeah, well, you shouldn't
verbalize it much more,

18:03.250 --> 18:04.707
especially in front of women.

18:06.375 --> 18:08.124
And what's your seduction method?

18:09.000 --> 18:10.374
I act cocky and tough.

18:10.875 --> 18:12.790
- And does it work?
- Yes.

18:13.375 --> 18:15.999
At times. Not always.
Hardly ever.

18:18.333 --> 18:19.533
But, according to your theory,

18:19.666 --> 18:22.874
you score because
you've aroused a feeling of pity.

18:22.958 --> 18:25.415
And deep down, all guys know that.

18:25.875 --> 18:28.749
But we never talk about it.
And never will.

18:29.208 --> 18:30.290
It's our secret.

18:34.458 --> 18:36.698
Do you and your inner child
mind if I go to the washroom?

18:37.083 --> 18:38.165
No, we don't.

18:59.458 --> 19:02.124
Our first official date
seems like the fourth.

19:03.375 --> 19:06.582
Shouldn't it be more banal,
more superficial?

19:07.166 --> 19:10.707
I've made an ellipsis.
I've jumped forward three weeks.

19:10.875 --> 19:11.875
I see.

19:12.208 --> 19:14.499
Come back to today for a minute,

19:15.416 --> 19:17.374
and tell me
something about yourself,

19:17.500 --> 19:19.832
as if we were
getting to know each other.

19:21.166 --> 19:24.540
I'm an alien secret agent
sent by my bosses

19:24.708 --> 19:27.957
to assassinate the most important
political leaders on Earth.

19:29.208 --> 19:30.790
You'd be doing us a favor.

19:30.958 --> 19:31.958
Not really.

19:32.083 --> 19:36.374
The plan is to create chaos
and make our invasion easier.

19:37.166 --> 19:39.124
Do you know
how you'll kill them?

19:39.583 --> 19:42.582
I have to think about it.
It's mass magnicide.

19:43.041 --> 19:46.832
And if I screw up, I'll face
an Intergalactic Court Martial.

19:47.458 --> 19:51.165
- What planet are you from?
- One in the ass end of nowhere.

19:51.500 --> 19:52.999
Yes, I know it!

19:54.083 --> 19:57.165
Do you have a girlfriend there,
a wife...?

19:57.375 --> 20:00.165
It isn't necessary.
we're hermaphrodites.

20:00.416 --> 20:04.832
Listen, I'm bored talking about me.
Can I start lying?

20:08.458 --> 20:09.707
Talking about lying,

20:10.333 --> 20:13.582
do you have
a false Earthling identity

20:13.750 --> 20:15.374
so as to go unnoticed?

20:16.333 --> 20:17.374
Of course.

20:17.833 --> 20:20.915
I can't go round saying
I'm an intergalactic assassin.

20:22.208 --> 20:24.249
And what's your cover?

20:25.625 --> 20:27.290
What do you think it is?

20:30.208 --> 20:33.290
You pass yourself off
as a guy from Saragossa

20:33.416 --> 20:35.999
who at first sight
isn't very remarkable...

20:36.125 --> 20:37.499
Perfectly normal.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.999
...with a job he doesn't like...

20:40.708 --> 20:41.790
Frustrating.

20:42.166 --> 20:44.957
...and a social life
that isn't fully satisfying.

20:45.708 --> 20:46.708
Tedious.

20:49.291 --> 20:51.332
Why did you go to the bookstore?

20:52.041 --> 20:53.957
I've never seen you there before.

20:54.666 --> 20:57.999
I like bookstores.
They're magical places.

20:58.125 --> 20:59.249
Yes, of course.

20:59.958 --> 21:02.332
Where you find girls like me,

21:02.500 --> 21:06.832
stirring up intergalactic assassins
with their passion for life.

21:07.125 --> 21:09.040
And that's your cover.

21:09.833 --> 21:11.999
- You think so?
- I do.

21:13.166 --> 21:14.540
Maybe I'm like that.

21:15.166 --> 21:17.374
- No.
- Why not?

21:19.000 --> 21:21.249
Because if you were,
you wouldn't be real.

21:21.375 --> 21:23.207
You'd be a fictional character.

21:23.458 --> 21:27.165
You'd only exist to help me
find a meaning to my life

21:27.291 --> 21:29.124
without caring about
your own happiness.

21:30.250 --> 21:35.124
What a writer friend of mine calls
a Manic Pixie Dream Girl.

21:35.958 --> 21:37.374
And what's that?

21:37.875 --> 21:39.957
Something that's hard to find.

21:41.166 --> 21:44.165
- Am I a Manic Pixie Dream Girl?
- No.

21:44.666 --> 21:45.957
That's your cover.

21:46.291 --> 21:50.082
Like mine to conceal that
I'm an intergalactic assassin.

21:51.625 --> 21:53.082
And what am I concealing?

21:56.958 --> 21:57.958
Come on.

22:02.416 --> 22:04.249
I think your heart was broken.

22:05.666 --> 22:06.999
Very recently.

22:07.916 --> 22:08.957
You were left,

22:09.541 --> 22:11.374
which could happen to any of us.

22:12.291 --> 22:16.290
But you feel
as if you've been torn apart.

22:18.166 --> 22:19.457
How do you know that?

22:20.375 --> 22:22.540
Are you all mind readers
on your planet?

22:23.208 --> 22:24.249
Of course.

22:25.791 --> 22:27.415
But, as well, I saw you.

22:29.583 --> 22:30.583
What?

22:30.791 --> 22:32.957
A few days before we met,

22:33.625 --> 22:34.625
I went to the bookstore

22:35.625 --> 22:39.374
<i>and I saw you sitting with him,
crying your eyes out.</i>

22:40.625 --> 22:44.165
<i>And you kept crying
for a long time after he left.</i>

22:46.750 --> 22:49.749
As well as an intergalactic
assassin, you're a cheat.

22:50.958 --> 22:52.624
You played with an advantage.

22:54.958 --> 22:56.457
Can you forgive me?

22:58.416 --> 23:00.540
You changed the rules of the game.

23:02.625 --> 23:04.040
I don't know if I like them.

23:05.166 --> 23:06.540
While you decide,

23:07.375 --> 23:08.499
can we keep playing?

23:12.333 --> 23:13.540
I have to go.

23:27.958 --> 23:28.999
Will you come with me?

23:35.375 --> 23:37.124
Are you still in love with him?

23:38.250 --> 23:39.540
I can't help it.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.332
He isn't handsome.

23:43.208 --> 23:44.457
He doesn't have to be.

23:44.958 --> 23:46.957
He's a poet, you know.

23:47.375 --> 23:50.082
- Accursed?
- Really accursed.

23:50.750 --> 23:51.790
Is he good?

23:52.125 --> 23:53.874
Yes, that's the problem.

23:54.875 --> 23:57.957
How much are you in love with him,
from 0 to 10?

23:58.416 --> 23:59.416
Nine?

24:00.625 --> 24:01.999
I reckoned a seven.

24:02.416 --> 24:04.124
He really worked on it.

24:04.333 --> 24:06.874
He's the kind who doesn't stop
until you adore him.

24:07.041 --> 24:09.457
And when you do,
he gets scared and leaves.

24:09.750 --> 24:11.165
To look for another victim.

24:11.666 --> 24:14.290
He may have had one
before he left me.

24:14.958 --> 24:16.749
- You know him well.
- Yes.

24:17.125 --> 24:19.374
It's the second time
I've let him destroy me.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.207
I hope there won't be a third.

24:21.625 --> 24:24.332
So do I.
Because there could be.

24:25.375 --> 24:26.832
You'd go back to him?

24:28.041 --> 24:31.665
If he changed, and changed a lot,
maybe.

24:31.875 --> 24:33.124
Is that possible?

24:34.625 --> 24:39.415
My problem is I don't believe in
God, but I do believe in miracles.

24:41.791 --> 24:44.290
How big a fool am I,
from 0 to 10?

24:44.958 --> 24:45.958
Four.

24:46.291 --> 24:47.624
I was expecting an eight.

24:47.791 --> 24:50.874
No, I'm sure that
even if he was a bastard,

24:51.041 --> 24:54.707
you've had marvelous moments,
the kind we never talk about.

24:55.166 --> 24:56.457
What do you mean?

24:56.625 --> 24:59.957
I mean that we mostly complain
about our partners.

25:00.500 --> 25:04.124
No one calls to tell you about
a romantic walk with his girlfriend,

25:04.250 --> 25:07.582
hand in hand, picking flowers,
stepping on dogshit together.

25:07.708 --> 25:10.582
But they do say:
"Look what the bastard did to me".

25:10.708 --> 25:12.707
Or:
"Listen to what the bitch said".

25:12.958 --> 25:14.249
That's how we are.

25:14.750 --> 25:18.790
We moan about the bad parts and say
nothing about the great moments

25:18.916 --> 25:21.957
that keep us hooked
on bitches and bastards.

25:23.666 --> 25:27.707
You know when I had
my last great moment with my ex?

25:28.208 --> 25:30.624
It wasn't the day he left you.

25:31.083 --> 25:32.957
- The day before.
- A coherent guy.

25:33.083 --> 25:34.499
Super-coherent.

25:35.166 --> 25:36.957
We had a romantic dinner,

25:37.208 --> 25:39.499
he said he loved me
more than anything,

25:39.666 --> 25:41.832
and the next day, goodbye.

25:43.125 --> 25:44.624
I can say it in two ways:

25:45.208 --> 25:48.374
he's a sicko or he's a sack of shit.
You choose.

25:48.666 --> 25:49.874
No, they both work.

25:51.791 --> 25:53.415
And even so, I miss him.

25:54.250 --> 25:55.374
Really?

25:56.583 --> 25:59.582
That the difference
between real life and the movies.

25:59.708 --> 26:01.832
In the movies
a bastard is a bastard.

26:02.666 --> 26:05.332
In real life.
a bastard can also be wonderful.

26:17.291 --> 26:22.540
Thank you.

26:38.708 --> 26:40.582
How long were you together?

26:42.166 --> 26:44.999
Long enough to make me believe
I was the woman of his dreams.

26:45.500 --> 26:46.500
So why did he leave?

26:48.000 --> 26:52.040
He started talking a load of shit
about karma, fate...

26:52.666 --> 26:57.249
I asked if he'd stopped loving me
and he said he loved me so much

26:57.500 --> 27:00.832
that a relationship as a couple
wasn't enough to show his love.

27:03.666 --> 27:05.749
Why did he leave me?
I don't know.

27:06.541 --> 27:09.999
He left for the same reason
we leave people and they leave us.

27:10.625 --> 27:11.332
Which is...?

27:11.625 --> 27:13.105
He thinks he deserves
better than you.

27:14.416 --> 27:15.540
Fucking bastard.

27:16.041 --> 27:17.332
Yes, insult him!

27:17.541 --> 27:19.290
No, you're the fucking bastard.

27:19.791 --> 27:21.957
- Do you realize what you said?
- Accept it!

27:22.416 --> 27:25.790
The fact is, if someone leaves you
it's because they think

27:25.916 --> 27:27.957
there's something better
waiting for them.

27:28.458 --> 27:30.582
I'm not saying your ex will find it.

27:32.875 --> 27:34.249
Have I disappointed you?

27:35.125 --> 27:36.874
Why would you?

27:37.458 --> 27:40.749
Because I'm not
the typical classic male fantasy.

27:41.666 --> 27:45.332
I'm as screwed up as any
screwed up girl in the real world.

27:45.791 --> 27:49.040
And in love
with a sicko and/or a sack of shit.

27:49.500 --> 27:50.500
Yeah.

27:51.583 --> 27:52.957
Not very glamourous.

27:53.416 --> 27:56.415
Don't worry. You know what
I like most in a woman?

27:56.916 --> 27:58.915
- Surprise me.
- Her defects.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.457
Then you'll fall
head over heels for me.

28:02.958 --> 28:03.958
No.

28:04.500 --> 28:06.790
You forbade me.
It's dangerous, remember?

28:07.500 --> 28:09.207
And you listen to me as well?

28:10.541 --> 28:12.915
You might be
the classic female fantasy.

28:14.250 --> 28:17.457
Are there any
Manic Pixie Dream Boys?

28:17.958 --> 28:18.958
Who knows?

28:19.583 --> 28:20.874
Why not find out for yourself?

28:24.958 --> 28:26.915
I've told you lots of things.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.957
Next week you'll have to answer
loads of uncomfortable questions.

28:31.375 --> 28:33.832
It's best to get nasty things
out of the way quickly.

28:33.958 --> 28:34.958
The day after tomorrow?

28:36.333 --> 28:37.333
All right.

28:38.250 --> 28:39.415
Do you know this place?

28:41.583 --> 28:43.874
- Yes.
- Perfect, because I don't.

28:44.375 --> 28:46.874
My partner recommended it.
How about lunch?

28:47.750 --> 28:49.540
Sure. About 3 o'clock?

28:49.875 --> 28:54.582
Yes. I'll be with Paulo Coelho,
thinking about our nonsense.

28:54.708 --> 28:56.790
See you then, Manic Elf.

28:57.666 --> 28:59.165
Goodbye, Manic Pixie.

29:06.875 --> 29:08.624
I like our new names!

29:48.041 --> 29:49.082
Hello, love.

29:49.916 --> 29:52.582
I hear you've embarked
on a new professional undertaking.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.957
<i>Yes, mom, I've got a new job.</i>

29:55.166 --> 29:57.957
That's great.
Shall I open the champagne?

29:58.083 --> 30:01.749
<i>Turn on the tap. It only deserves
a toast with water.</i>

30:01.875 --> 30:02.999
It's not what you wanted?

30:03.500 --> 30:04.999
Well, I don't need my degree.

30:05.375 --> 30:07.749
Changing the subject,
is it cold in Teruel?

30:08.416 --> 30:09.749
<i>What's the job?</i>

30:10.666 --> 30:13.999
Something I do without describing,
or else I'd slit my wrists.

30:14.750 --> 30:15.999
You're joking, aren't you?

30:16.208 --> 30:19.665
<i>Yes, and anyway
I can't afford razor blades.</i>

30:21.166 --> 30:22.249
Do you need money?

30:23.166 --> 30:25.874
If you offered me 300 euros
I wouldn't say no.

30:26.541 --> 30:29.165
- I'll send you 500 tomorrow.
<i>- Thanks, mom.</i>

30:29.375 --> 30:30.457
And don't get depressed.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.374
I'll see what I can do.

30:32.916 --> 30:33.916
Love you.

30:34.500 --> 30:35.832
Love you too.

30:46.458 --> 30:48.499
Don't worry,
I haven't bled to death.

30:48.791 --> 30:49.791
<i>Hello.</i>

30:49.916 --> 30:51.957
<i>I'm in the place where we met.</i>

30:52.958 --> 30:54.540
The night misses you.

30:54.958 --> 30:55.958
<i>What do you want?</i>

30:56.416 --> 30:58.457
Shouldn't you be on the lyre,
making rhymes?

30:59.000 --> 31:00.749
Why do I have to want something?

31:00.875 --> 31:03.707
<i>Because, Jorge,
you always want something.</i>

31:04.708 --> 31:05.790
What do you think I want?

31:09.500 --> 31:12.832
To know if I'm still hung up on you
after how you hurt me.

31:13.500 --> 31:15.082
I just want to know
if you're all right.

31:15.666 --> 31:18.040
- What?
- I keep thinking about you.

31:19.208 --> 31:21.707
<i>- You're joking, right?</i>
- No.

31:22.208 --> 31:23.374
<i>Are you sure?</i>

31:24.541 --> 31:27.290
It would be easier to forget myself
than to forget you.

31:28.166 --> 31:31.082
I remember you.
You're an asshole.

31:32.666 --> 31:33.790
Listen, Irene,

31:34.958 --> 31:38.749
it doesn't take an expert in Freud
to see you're in pain, but...

31:39.041 --> 31:41.915
No, I'm not all right.
I'm a fucking mess

31:42.250 --> 31:44.915
because an asshole sicko
and/or sack of shit

31:45.000 --> 31:46.957
left me for something better!

31:47.541 --> 31:48.665
Nothing's better than you.

31:48.958 --> 31:51.207
- Are you seeing someone?
<i>- Of course not.</i>

31:51.458 --> 31:52.624
So, several someones.

31:54.916 --> 31:56.874
Maybe it was a bad idea to call you.

31:57.250 --> 32:01.749
Not as bad as the Nazi holocaust,
but no, it wasn't good.

32:01.916 --> 32:03.665
I'm hanging up
because I am seeing someone.

32:04.666 --> 32:06.915
- Who is it?
<i>- You know what?</i>

32:07.083 --> 32:09.290
<i>- It's none of your business.</i>
- What's his name?

32:09.708 --> 32:11.082
Fuck you!
That's his name!

32:12.083 --> 32:13.540
You want to make me jealous?

32:14.375 --> 32:16.624
Don't dare flirt with me.

32:16.958 --> 32:20.415
He has the only thing I need
right now in a man. He isn't you!

32:36.208 --> 32:39.165
Don't bother firing me.
I'm quitting.

33:14.458 --> 33:16.665
Sorry,
I hate you seeing me like this.

33:18.916 --> 33:21.582
Ready for
loads of uncomfortable questions?

33:22.708 --> 33:23.749
All right.

33:24.666 --> 33:25.915
Are you married?

33:27.333 --> 33:29.665
She hasn't asked if you're married?

33:31.375 --> 33:32.375
No.

33:34.166 --> 33:35.707
Is that good or bad?

33:37.291 --> 33:38.291
Both things.

33:38.750 --> 33:41.707
Good, if she likes you so much
she doesn't care if you're married.

33:42.625 --> 33:45.749
Bad, if she doesn't want to sleep
with you and so she doesn't care.

33:48.708 --> 33:50.624
I didn't say
I wanted to sleep with her.

33:50.750 --> 33:52.082
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

33:52.208 --> 33:52.874
Yes,

33:53.166 --> 33:54.957
when you said she was really nice.

33:55.166 --> 33:56.415
You're a guy.

33:56.791 --> 33:59.707
If you like a girl,
of course you'd like to screw her.

34:00.208 --> 34:03.040
Girls, on the other hand,
are a different matter.

34:03.458 --> 34:06.040
They may like you,
but not to use you sexually.

34:06.416 --> 34:08.290
It's for something more sinister.

34:08.958 --> 34:10.581
- To devour our souls?
- Worse.

34:11.208 --> 34:12.540
So that you listen to them.

34:13.750 --> 34:15.290
Listen to them and...?

34:15.416 --> 34:16.581
That's all!

34:17.166 --> 34:19.998
They don't want you to solve
their problems, or to save them.

34:20.250 --> 34:21.331
Just listen to them.

34:22.125 --> 34:23.290
It seems easy.

34:24.333 --> 34:25.415
But it isn't!

34:26.000 --> 34:28.623
Listening isn't the same
as hearing what they say.

34:28.750 --> 34:32.206
It's hearing and caring.
They have to feel you're interested.

34:32.458 --> 34:35.248
If it seems you're listening
but you don't give a shit,

34:35.375 --> 34:38.040
they'll realize
and then you're lost.

34:38.166 --> 34:39.166
And then,

34:39.916 --> 34:41.456
then they'll devour your soul.

34:43.083 --> 34:45.165
- You're wise, Cristóbal.
- I know.

34:45.291 --> 34:47.665
But I don't see
the theme of this scene.

34:47.791 --> 34:50.706
- The theme?
- Yes, scenes are about something.

34:50.833 --> 34:52.592
- What's this one about?
- What do you think?

34:52.708 --> 34:55.248
I don't know, I'm listening to you
like you were a girl.

34:55.375 --> 34:57.499
- Do you care what I say?
- Do you think I care?

34:57.791 --> 34:58.915
You'd better care.

34:59.250 --> 35:00.250
I care.

35:01.875 --> 35:03.075
Is this how you listen to her?

35:03.541 --> 35:04.541
Yes.

35:04.958 --> 35:06.915
Then don't worry,
she won't devour your soul.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.332
And you might hook up,
or you might not.

35:10.291 --> 35:11.874
That's the theme!

35:12.333 --> 35:14.874
That we might or we mightn't?

35:15.041 --> 35:16.041
Exactly!

35:16.458 --> 35:19.249
- A hell of a theme!
- It's always been the theme.

35:19.375 --> 35:20.707
The Great Theme.

35:21.791 --> 35:23.790
Fuck the catfish!

35:23.958 --> 35:25.415
Write, dear colleague!

35:25.666 --> 35:28.540
Let those fingers gallop free
over the keys.

35:28.750 --> 35:30.624
We've found the Grail!

35:32.708 --> 35:35.040
God, I love going fishing!

35:37.583 --> 35:41.749
The next day...

35:52.291 --> 35:53.540
I owed you this.

35:54.125 --> 35:56.832
I was expecting
"loads of uncomfortable questions".

35:56.958 --> 35:57.958
Later.

35:59.291 --> 36:01.957
Guess who rang me
the day before yesterday.

36:02.541 --> 36:03.999
I'll say someone at random.

36:04.750 --> 36:05.750
Your ex.

36:06.416 --> 36:07.416
His name is Jorge.

36:08.125 --> 36:09.125
Are you back with him?

36:09.250 --> 36:10.250
No!

36:11.291 --> 36:14.374
Then I'll keep calling him
"Sack of shit".

36:14.791 --> 36:17.040
Fucking Sicko and/or Sack of shit.

36:17.625 --> 36:19.790
I gave it to him with both barrels.

36:20.458 --> 36:22.457
Why the display of violence?

36:23.500 --> 36:24.749
It just came out.

36:24.958 --> 36:26.624
I couldn't have done it without you.

36:26.833 --> 36:28.749
If you hadn't said all that,

36:28.875 --> 36:30.790
I'd have shit myself
when I heard him.

36:30.916 --> 36:33.124
So thank you
for being such a bastard.

36:33.541 --> 36:34.541
Why did he call?

36:35.541 --> 36:39.790
He felt guilty and wanted to hear
I was OK so he'd feel better.

36:40.625 --> 36:44.082
How bad did you make him
think you were, from 0 to 10?

36:46.458 --> 36:47.458
10,000.

36:48.125 --> 36:50.332
Before I hung up
I told him I was with you.

36:50.500 --> 36:51.957
I wanted to make him jealous.

36:52.500 --> 36:54.207
- And did you?
- Yes.

36:54.583 --> 36:58.374
After I hung up and cried for a bit,
we talked.

36:58.916 --> 37:00.040
- You and him?
- You and me.

37:01.166 --> 37:02.415
You did me a lot of good.

37:03.416 --> 37:05.249
Do you often talk to yourself?

37:06.166 --> 37:08.374
Manic Pixies do things like that.

37:09.208 --> 37:10.208
What did we talk about?

37:11.375 --> 37:13.135
I asked you
loads of uncomfortable questions.

37:14.291 --> 37:16.332
- Such as?
- Are you married?

37:23.875 --> 37:24.875
Very?

37:26.166 --> 37:27.166
Quite.

37:30.041 --> 37:31.041
To a woman?

37:32.833 --> 37:33.833
I think so.

37:35.500 --> 37:37.957
Is she
an intergalactic assassin too?

37:38.583 --> 37:41.999
Almost.
She's a bank manager.

37:42.166 --> 37:43.166
Shit.

37:43.375 --> 37:44.375
And you love her?

37:48.291 --> 37:49.291
A lot?

37:51.458 --> 37:54.082
When you asked me all this,
were my answers the same?

37:54.875 --> 37:55.875
No.

37:56.291 --> 37:57.291
What did I say?

37:58.750 --> 37:59.957
That you were single.

38:04.791 --> 38:05.915
Just a minute.

38:08.958 --> 38:09.958
Yes, Cristóbal?

38:10.125 --> 38:11.125
Go ahead.

38:16.125 --> 38:18.082
Yes, yes, Cristóbal, of course.

38:18.208 --> 38:20.457
No, no, no, Cristóbal,
of course not.

38:21.375 --> 38:22.624
I'm buying time.

38:22.750 --> 38:24.832
For what?
A good question.

38:26.666 --> 38:28.082
Did you fake the call?

38:28.250 --> 38:29.624
What? No.

38:31.958 --> 38:32.665
Yes.

38:32.958 --> 38:34.040
How did you know?

38:34.208 --> 38:37.082
1 . Your phone didn't ring.
2. I'm brilliant.

38:37.500 --> 38:38.665
Why did you do it?

38:39.583 --> 38:41.540
Because I'm a control freak.

38:41.750 --> 38:43.749
I wanted to prepare
what I'm going to say.

38:43.958 --> 38:45.040
And have you?

38:45.500 --> 38:49.040
- You didn't give me time.
- Too bad. No matter, tell me.

38:49.583 --> 38:50.583
Tell me.

38:50.750 --> 38:52.332
I've been married for five years.

38:52.500 --> 38:55.957
Do I love my wife? Yes.
A lot? Yes.

38:56.125 --> 38:59.790
Does she love me? Yes.
A lot? I don't know.

38:59.958 --> 39:02.624
Or rather, she doesn't know.
And while she's deciding,

39:02.750 --> 39:06.707
she asked me to move out for a while
so I'm living with a friend,

39:06.875 --> 39:08.249
in Voltania, no less.

39:08.583 --> 39:09.999
When was that?

39:10.291 --> 39:11.582
A month ago.

39:11.958 --> 39:14.457
- What happened?
- That's what I asked her.

39:14.583 --> 39:16.165
And the answer was insane.

39:16.541 --> 39:17.541
Nothing.

39:17.666 --> 39:21.040
Don't you realize? In eight years,
nothing has happened to us.

39:21.666 --> 39:23.790
That "Nothing"
is her way of summing up

39:24.000 --> 39:26.082
5 years of marriage
and 3 of dating,

39:26.375 --> 39:28.415
which was quite a shock,

39:28.541 --> 39:30.707
because for me
they're full of marvelous moments,

39:30.833 --> 39:34.624
one of which is Laura,
our lovely four year old daughter,

39:34.750 --> 39:36.749
who apparently
is part of that nothing!

39:37.125 --> 39:38.415
That's enough, Carlos!

39:38.833 --> 39:42.124
I'm sorry, the human being's
only commitment is to his passion.

39:42.625 --> 39:45.374
What's the message?
You don't turn me on. Get out.

39:45.500 --> 39:47.624
- She's a fucking cynic.
- What's her name?

39:47.916 --> 39:49.374
María. Just María.

39:49.583 --> 39:52.957
If you don't mind,
I'll call her "Fucking cynic".

39:53.041 --> 39:55.957
That's fine.
She always wanted a middle name.

40:00.083 --> 40:02.957
I keep wondering what I did wrong.

40:04.125 --> 40:05.499
And the answer is...?

40:06.458 --> 40:07.458
Nothing.

40:11.000 --> 40:15.290
I followed the Instruction Manual
for a Perfect Life, step by step:

40:15.958 --> 40:17.540
studies, work,

40:18.125 --> 40:19.832
wedding, child...

40:20.583 --> 40:22.165
How does the manual go on?

40:22.416 --> 40:23.665
It ends there.

40:23.791 --> 40:26.165
Supposedly, if you do all that
you should be happy.

40:26.958 --> 40:30.540
Well, María isn't,
and I'm the reason why.

40:30.833 --> 40:32.999
Where do I lodge my complaint?

40:33.666 --> 40:36.082
But Fucking Cynic
asked for a bit of time.

40:36.666 --> 40:37.749
Two months.

40:37.875 --> 40:39.707
It's only been one.
Wait and see.

40:40.125 --> 40:43.540
I'm doing that. But I know
that in the best of cases

40:43.916 --> 40:46.790
in a month she'll tell me
to come home because...

40:48.333 --> 40:49.333
I don't know.

40:49.458 --> 40:51.665
She's discovered that,
despite everything,

40:51.791 --> 40:53.624
she's still in love with you.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.040
For example.

40:55.583 --> 40:58.165
When what she really means is...

41:00.625 --> 41:04.415
I didn't find the "something better
than you" that I think I deserve,

41:04.541 --> 41:07.499
so I'll settle for you, my love.

41:08.541 --> 41:10.832
I've got a whip
from the Inquisition. You want it?

41:11.333 --> 41:14.165
Do you beat yourself with it
when you think of Sack of Shit?

41:14.291 --> 41:15.832
Not since I insulted him.

41:16.750 --> 41:17.540
You know what?

41:17.708 --> 41:19.457
You should pick up a cutie,

41:19.916 --> 41:22.457
the kind that would make
even the Pope a crack dealer,

41:22.625 --> 41:24.624
and make sure your wife finds out.

41:24.750 --> 41:26.832
She'd go mad with jealousy
and come back to you.

41:27.541 --> 41:28.915
I see the happy ending,

41:29.041 --> 41:31.290
the two of you kissing
like the Lovers of Teruel.

41:34.250 --> 41:35.490
Last night I dreamed about you.

41:36.958 --> 41:37.958
With what permission?

41:38.000 --> 41:39.999
With none.
Have I screwed up?

41:40.291 --> 41:43.499
No. I don't like
men who ask permission to dream.

41:44.166 --> 41:46.332
We were sitting in a park.

41:46.833 --> 41:47.833
Playing?

41:48.500 --> 41:49.500
What else?

41:49.666 --> 41:53.415
And suddenly
a boy and girl came up.

41:53.541 --> 41:54.541
Hello.

41:54.875 --> 41:57.040
Are you in love
or something like that?

41:57.750 --> 41:58.750
No.

41:59.083 --> 42:00.540
She forbade me.

42:00.916 --> 42:01.916
Too bad.

42:02.208 --> 42:06.207
We sing songs
for people who are in love.

42:07.125 --> 42:09.582
We can sing one for you,
even if you're not.

42:10.208 --> 42:12.540
- Can we pick the song?
- You don't have to.

42:12.916 --> 42:15.165
It's a dream,
so we'll play one you like.

42:26.583 --> 42:27.957
<i>So they started singing.</i>

42:28.458 --> 42:29.540
<i>What was it?</i>

42:30.166 --> 42:31.832
<i>Kind of like Aretha Franklin.</i>

42:32.833 --> 42:36.207
- Your subconscious has good taste.
- Thank you, I'll tell it.

43:47.250 --> 43:48.874
<i>And what were we doing?</i>

43:49.958 --> 43:51.332
<i>Watching them play.</i>

43:53.000 --> 43:54.249
<i>That's all?</i>

43:54.666 --> 43:56.707
<i>The girl sang very well.</i>

44:01.291 --> 44:02.874
<i>And how did it end?</i>

44:03.875 --> 44:04.957
It didn't.

44:06.583 --> 44:07.832
I suddenly woke up.

44:09.375 --> 44:10.415
Nice dream.

44:11.166 --> 44:12.166
Thank you.

44:14.500 --> 44:15.707
Does the park exist?

44:16.083 --> 44:17.083
Yes.

44:17.291 --> 44:18.291
And the musicians?

44:19.083 --> 44:20.582
If they don't, they should.

44:22.958 --> 44:24.290
Any more uncomfortable questions?

44:24.833 --> 44:26.332
- No.
- Really?

44:26.583 --> 44:28.540
Come off it,
I've got thousands!

44:30.166 --> 44:31.665
But I won't ask them here.

44:51.958 --> 44:53.249
Are you from here?

44:53.458 --> 44:56.624
No. I told you,
I'm from a very distant galaxy.

44:57.958 --> 44:59.707
- And you?
- Me too.

44:59.958 --> 45:01.249
I'm from Teruel.

45:02.625 --> 45:03.957
How old are you?

45:04.625 --> 45:05.790
What do you think?

45:07.250 --> 45:08.957
More or less... forty?

45:09.250 --> 45:10.250
Bang on.

45:10.750 --> 45:12.999
- You?
- What do you think?

45:14.458 --> 45:16.082
More or less... thirty.

45:16.666 --> 45:17.666
Exactly.

45:17.791 --> 45:20.249
I'm so old.
Ten years older than you.

45:20.416 --> 45:21.999
Jorge is even older.

45:22.458 --> 45:24.249
Am I too young for you?

45:24.458 --> 45:25.665
I don't know yet.

45:27.458 --> 45:28.832
What do you do?

45:29.541 --> 45:32.040
I go for walks
with girls ten years younger.

45:33.125 --> 45:36.707
- Do you always make bad jokes?
- Yes. I do that too.

45:37.416 --> 45:38.790
And professionally?

45:39.375 --> 45:41.165
I meant professionally.

45:42.125 --> 45:43.749
Are you a comedian?

45:44.666 --> 45:45.666
Almost.

45:46.166 --> 45:47.166
Writer?

45:47.458 --> 45:49.082
Writer-ette.

45:49.958 --> 45:52.457
- Anything I might have read?
- No.

45:53.166 --> 45:57.290
But have you seen a film called
"Ditsy and Bozo"?

45:57.833 --> 46:00.374
Those two girls
who are fucking birdbrains?

46:00.500 --> 46:03.332
- Well summarized. That one.
- Of course I saw it!

46:03.458 --> 46:04.582
Did you write it?

46:04.791 --> 46:08.415
I wouldn't call it writing.
My partner and I scrawled it.

46:09.333 --> 46:11.582
You don't seem
very fond of your film.

46:11.958 --> 46:14.749
If I had pancreatic cancer,
that would be mine too,

46:14.875 --> 46:16.165
but I wouldn't be a fan.

46:16.375 --> 46:19.999
Hey, Jorge and I
pissed ourselves laughing.

46:20.458 --> 46:21.540
It's crap.

46:21.708 --> 46:23.540
A lot of people
were pissing themselves.

46:23.666 --> 46:24.957
It's still crap.

46:25.083 --> 46:26.540
It was a big hit.

46:26.750 --> 46:28.790
- So was Milli Vanilli.
- Tell me,

46:29.416 --> 46:31.040
- have you written anything else?
- Sure.

46:31.250 --> 46:32.749
We're doing "Ditsy and Bozo 2",

46:32.875 --> 46:36.124
but we've also signed up
for the third, which is called:

46:36.666 --> 46:39.374
"DitsyDitsyDitsy BozoBozoBozo".

46:39.625 --> 46:40.625
Original.

46:41.166 --> 46:42.957
Can you live decently from that?

46:43.666 --> 46:45.915
And die intellectually.

46:47.416 --> 46:48.416
I sense

46:48.708 --> 46:52.415
that you'd like to be remembered
for something more serious.

46:52.625 --> 46:56.207
Like the play
I've been writing for three years.

46:56.375 --> 46:57.707
Three years?

46:57.958 --> 47:00.249
What is it?
A reflection on nothingness?

47:01.166 --> 47:04.207
Have you heard of Truman Capote
and Charles Bukowski?

47:05.583 --> 47:07.915
Thank you for that subtle insult,

47:08.000 --> 47:10.082
but I can appreciate
your crappy films

47:10.333 --> 47:11.582
and read books.

47:11.750 --> 47:14.832
My favorite by Bukowski is
"The Fuck Machine", and by Capote,

47:15.791 --> 47:16.791
everything.

47:17.041 --> 47:18.665
They're my two gods.

47:18.791 --> 47:22.332
In fact, my play is called
"Capote and Bukowski in Hell".

47:22.541 --> 47:23.541
What's it about?

47:23.750 --> 47:26.499
Capote and Bukowski die
and meet in Hell.

47:26.708 --> 47:27.915
I suspected that.

47:28.916 --> 47:30.832
And why don't you finish it?

47:31.583 --> 47:33.832
It's hard to write for your gods.

47:34.541 --> 47:37.957
Writing dialogue for them
is like blaspheming.

47:38.291 --> 47:39.915
And if you change writers?

47:40.041 --> 47:44.624
They're perfect, we hardly know
what they thought of each other.

47:45.000 --> 47:49.040
Bukowski wrote a poem about Capote,
tearing him to bits.

47:49.166 --> 47:52.582
Yes, but he tore him to bits
with some respect.

47:53.625 --> 47:56.957
- I don't know if they even met.
- I see.

47:57.166 --> 48:00.082
And you want their first
official chat to be in Hell.

48:00.250 --> 48:04.040
Yes, and I'm having trouble
recreating their voices.

48:04.208 --> 48:07.624
Look, they're two geniuses,
they're your gods,

48:07.750 --> 48:11.082
and you send them to Hell.
Of course you'll have problems.

48:11.541 --> 48:13.874
I can't even get them
to start talking.

48:14.333 --> 48:16.332
What have they done
these three years?

48:18.833 --> 48:20.665
Bukowski looks at Capote.

48:21.500 --> 48:23.290
Capote looks at Bukowski.

48:23.833 --> 48:24.915
They look at me.

48:25.541 --> 48:26.749
I look at them.

48:28.208 --> 48:30.499
I think the three of us
are terrified.

48:32.333 --> 48:34.082
Don't worry, they'll talk.

48:35.625 --> 48:36.625
You think so?

48:37.500 --> 48:40.124
They're Charles Bukowski
and Truman Capote.

48:41.000 --> 48:42.499
Have faith in them.

49:03.583 --> 49:05.332
I know it's against the rules

49:06.625 --> 49:09.207
but I'd like to know
a little bit more about you.

49:10.958 --> 49:13.749
You know enough.
Why more?

49:15.416 --> 49:17.082
It's important for me.

49:19.750 --> 49:22.374
I'm just a girl
who's done a bit of everything.

49:23.125 --> 49:24.540
I've studied a bit,

49:24.708 --> 49:27.249
I've traveled a bit,

49:27.958 --> 49:30.999
I've had jobs
that weren't one bit interesting.

49:31.375 --> 49:32.375
I'm unemployed now

49:32.708 --> 49:35.749
and that's more thrilling
than talking about my jobs.

49:36.916 --> 49:38.540
I've fallen in love a bit.

49:41.000 --> 49:42.999
At times, I've been loved back.

49:45.833 --> 49:46.874
To sum up,

49:47.166 --> 49:49.040
I've lived, a bit.

49:50.291 --> 49:52.040
And now, The Big Question.

49:53.375 --> 49:54.935
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

49:59.041 --> 50:00.957
I want to keep having dreams.

50:01.125 --> 50:04.040
Even if they don't come true,
I want to keep having them.

50:04.958 --> 50:06.207
What dreams do you have now?

50:07.208 --> 50:09.249
I've got no money
and my heart's broken.

50:09.750 --> 50:12.582
My dream is to be a bit happy.
Am I very ambitious?

50:12.958 --> 50:14.165
Megalomaniac.

50:15.750 --> 50:19.374
And your torrid relationship
with Capote and Bukowski?

50:21.708 --> 50:25.790
Don't spread it around, but
the working class has its secrets.

50:26.250 --> 50:27.457
For example,

50:27.666 --> 50:32.582
my father was a humble bricklayer
all his life, but he loved reading.

50:32.708 --> 50:35.749
He gave me the right books
at the right times.

50:36.125 --> 50:37.957
The best gift he could give me.

50:39.041 --> 50:40.749
What's your favorite book?

50:41.708 --> 50:42.708
One?

50:43.375 --> 50:45.165
- Are you crazy?
- Yes.

50:45.625 --> 50:48.165
I could give you a list of ten.

50:48.333 --> 50:50.957
- I'd love to have it.
- It's yours.

50:51.208 --> 50:54.707
And I'll have a panic attack
trying to pick only ten.

50:56.416 --> 50:59.290
So it wasn't by chance
I met you in a bookstore?

50:59.958 --> 51:01.082
The longer I live,

51:01.291 --> 51:03.582
the more I'm convinced
chance doesn't exist.

51:09.958 --> 51:12.082
When María asked me

51:12.208 --> 51:15.374
for two months of "temporary
interruption of cohabitation",

51:15.500 --> 51:17.260
I immediately thought
there was someone else.

51:18.250 --> 51:19.665
I thought that too.

51:20.041 --> 51:22.957
- She denied it.
- No shit! And you believed it?

51:24.083 --> 51:25.415
I preferred to.

51:26.125 --> 51:28.707
But María doesn't dump
out-of-date yogurts

51:28.833 --> 51:30.249
before she buys new ones.

51:31.166 --> 51:33.915
You're the out-of-date yogurt?

51:36.000 --> 51:40.707
Anyway, I did what my friend
and partner told me not to do.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.499
- You didn't hire a detective?
- No.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.082
I was the detective.

51:47.666 --> 51:49.457
- Oh, God!
- Yes, I know.

51:49.583 --> 51:51.415
Anyway, I started following her.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.332
Room 237?
I'm on my way.

51:54.750 --> 51:55.957
<i>And there's another guy.</i>

51:56.416 --> 51:57.957
<i>There's another guy.</i>

51:58.916 --> 52:01.124
<i>And they meet in hotels,</i>

52:01.416 --> 52:02.790
<i>in my home, in his home,</i>

52:02.916 --> 52:04.915
<i>without bothering
to pretend about anything.</i>

52:05.375 --> 52:08.249
If I had any pride,
I'd just ask for a divorce.

52:08.375 --> 52:10.332
As I'm not, what do I do?
Follow her.

52:10.458 --> 52:13.415
To see what I did wrong,
to see what he's got that I haven't.

52:14.125 --> 52:15.290
Apart from your wife.

52:17.250 --> 52:18.415
And, following him,

52:20.208 --> 52:23.832
<i>I arrive at a bookstore
and see him breaking the heart</i>

52:23.958 --> 52:26.540
<i>of a girl who is more or less 30,</i>

52:26.708 --> 52:30.415
<i>and a fan of Charles Bukowski
and Truman Capote.</i>

52:34.958 --> 52:36.165
Are you saying

52:36.583 --> 52:40.790
that Sack of Shit
is screwing Fucking Cynic?

52:41.458 --> 52:43.707
You're right.
Chance doesn't exist.

52:44.333 --> 52:45.707
He left me for your wife?

52:46.041 --> 52:47.874
And my wife
left me for your guy.

52:48.333 --> 52:51.790
The woman who thinks she deserves
something better than you

52:51.916 --> 52:54.436
is with the guy who thinks he
deserves something better than me?

52:54.750 --> 52:57.207
How many ways do you want to say it?
Yes, they're screwing!

52:57.625 --> 53:00.249
Why did you wait so long to tell me?

53:00.708 --> 53:03.040
Because I loved
the start of our story,

53:03.375 --> 53:05.249
if you can call it that.

53:05.708 --> 53:09.165
Look, our partners are
fucking each other's brains out,

53:09.291 --> 53:11.374
so call it
whatever the hell you want!

53:12.000 --> 53:14.624
All right, I didn't want
their story to ruin ours!

53:26.625 --> 53:29.082
Is this the first time
someone's cheated on you?

53:30.833 --> 53:32.749
Or the first time I found out.

53:33.625 --> 53:34.749
And you?

53:35.375 --> 53:38.457
Once Jorge thought he was in love
with someone else and he left me.

53:40.291 --> 53:41.374
Who was she?

53:41.583 --> 53:43.749
A kind of poetess.

53:44.291 --> 53:45.790
They didn't rhyme well?

53:45.958 --> 53:48.915
No, they didn't rhyme.
He came back to me, crying.

53:49.416 --> 53:50.832
And you forgave him.

53:50.958 --> 53:53.624
I'm all heart.
And he made such an effort.

53:53.791 --> 53:55.374
He lied to me, to himself...

53:55.583 --> 53:57.957
Not to forgive him
would've been unforgivable.

54:01.291 --> 54:02.457
Why do you try so hard?

54:03.458 --> 54:06.332
That's how I am.
I see an impossible guy like Jorge

54:06.458 --> 54:09.207
who won't commit,
who screws everything, and I say:

54:09.333 --> 54:10.832
You're going
to fall in love with me.

54:11.416 --> 54:12.790
It's a girl thing.

54:15.458 --> 54:18.207
María and I were in the same gang.

54:19.291 --> 54:21.915
I never thought for a minute
she'd notice me.

54:22.833 --> 54:25.582
<i>But one night
she came up to me and said:</i>

54:25.833 --> 54:29.249
Give me 24 hours to prove
I'm the woman of your dreams.

54:30.291 --> 54:32.457
- And she didn't need 23 of them.
- No.

54:32.666 --> 54:34.332
That sentence was enough.

54:37.916 --> 54:40.749
I met Jorge in Teruel, at a recital.

54:41.000 --> 54:44.415
There he was, reciting verses
and looking into my eyes.

54:45.458 --> 54:47.040
<i>When he finished,
he came up to me</i>

54:47.583 --> 54:51.082
<i>and you know what
his first three words to me were?</i>

54:51.833 --> 54:52.833
You're really hot.

54:52.958 --> 54:53.958
No.

54:54.625 --> 54:58.582
I love you.

54:58.958 --> 54:59.499
Twice?

54:59.875 --> 55:00.875
Twice.

55:00.958 --> 55:03.499
A good sentence.
I have to say it more.

55:03.666 --> 55:06.874
He uses it constantly
and he knows how to do it.

55:08.666 --> 55:10.332
What's the best thing about him?

55:13.041 --> 55:15.499
He's a man
who hasn't forgotten to be a child.

55:17.208 --> 55:18.499
And the worst?

55:20.000 --> 55:22.457
At times
the child forgets he's a man.

55:24.250 --> 55:26.124
What's the best thing about her?

55:27.916 --> 55:30.665
Just by looking at you
she makes you feel like a god.

55:31.083 --> 55:32.749
The worst is
she doesn't look at me now.

55:33.083 --> 55:34.290
She must have turned agnostic.

55:35.958 --> 55:37.624
Why did he fall for you?

55:39.041 --> 55:41.457
Jorge says he feels safe with me.

55:42.083 --> 55:44.040
At the same time he needs risk.

55:45.250 --> 55:47.707
He lives life like an adventure,
and I love that.

55:48.875 --> 55:51.457
But I hate his selfishness,
and that he lectures me

55:51.583 --> 55:53.999
and that he's always quoting
fucking Sigmund Freud.

55:57.458 --> 55:59.124
Why did she fall for you?

56:02.750 --> 56:04.040
I wish I knew.

56:04.708 --> 56:06.290
What was it she said
when she left you?

56:07.166 --> 56:09.124
"The human being's
only commitment..."

56:09.250 --> 56:11.957
"is to his passion".
That's Jorge. Word for word.

56:12.083 --> 56:13.374
- No!
- Yes.

56:13.583 --> 56:15.749
She left me with a sentence
copied from Sack of Shit?

56:15.958 --> 56:17.749
I wonder who he copied it from!

56:18.541 --> 56:22.749
- Did he use it to seduce her?
- Definitely. It worked with me.

56:23.958 --> 56:24.958
Hey,

56:25.000 --> 56:27.749
I can get you boiling oil
as well as a whip,

56:27.916 --> 56:29.499
if you want
to torture yourself more.

56:29.750 --> 56:32.832
My wife was taken from me
with a sentence by... Who?

56:33.041 --> 56:35.915
- Oscar Wilde?
- It sounds more like Paulo Coelho.

56:36.250 --> 56:39.540
If that's how you console me,
I prefer the boiling oil.

56:46.166 --> 56:47.665
<i>Have you confronted her?</i>

56:48.791 --> 56:51.457
I wouldn't do that
even with the Avengers on my side.

56:52.083 --> 56:53.707
You're that afraid of her?

56:54.000 --> 56:57.124
No, I'm not afraid.
I'd say I'm terrified.

56:57.833 --> 57:00.249
Introduce her to Stephen King.
He's looking for new ideas.

57:00.416 --> 57:01.707
He'd love her.

57:02.500 --> 57:03.624
Being with her

57:03.750 --> 57:06.874
is like being in front of a mirror
where you only see disappointment.

57:07.416 --> 57:09.665
Her disappointment or yours?

57:10.000 --> 57:14.540
Hers, mine, even my daughter's,
and she doesn't know what it is yet.

57:15.958 --> 57:19.749
One option is to call her and say:
"Hi, love, how are you?

57:19.875 --> 57:21.957
Oh, I know who you're screwing."

57:22.458 --> 57:26.499
And if I told you
I rang her two weeks ago?

57:27.750 --> 57:28.832
Tell me.

57:29.458 --> 57:31.040
I rang her two weeks ago.

57:31.541 --> 57:33.874
I told her
I knew there was someone else.

57:35.458 --> 57:37.082
You know what she said?

57:38.166 --> 57:40.332
What annoys me
isn't that you're paranoid,

57:40.541 --> 57:42.790
it's that
you're such a common paranoid.

57:42.916 --> 57:45.124
Leave me in peace
and go with Ditsy and Bozo!

57:49.125 --> 57:51.707
And after that constructive remark,

57:52.500 --> 57:53.624
she hung up.

57:53.916 --> 57:55.874
But she didn't hang up properly.

57:57.625 --> 57:59.749
And you didn't hang up either.

58:02.333 --> 58:03.665
You heard something?

58:05.666 --> 58:07.165
Was she with Jorge?

58:11.416 --> 58:14.290
They didn't start to...
right there?

58:21.041 --> 58:22.457
And you didn't hang up?

58:22.875 --> 58:23.915
How?

58:24.250 --> 58:25.749
I was paralyzed!

58:25.875 --> 58:29.832
How can you be such a masochist?
You're Torquemada's erotic fantasy!

58:30.083 --> 58:32.290
At least
I'm somebody's erotic fantasy!

58:33.583 --> 58:36.624
I hope you didn't tape the call
to suffer even more.

58:36.750 --> 58:38.624
Of course not.
I'm not that demented.

58:38.791 --> 58:40.851
You want to know
the craziest thing about the matter?

58:40.875 --> 58:45.832
No, I don't, because the matter
is my ex screwing someone else.

58:46.416 --> 58:48.790
That's the matter.
She seemed like someone else.

58:49.041 --> 58:51.665
I heard them
in full sexual apocalypse

58:51.791 --> 58:54.832
and María was nothing like
the lady I married,

58:54.958 --> 58:57.499
who never let me experiment in bed.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.957
We followed the same script
for eight years.

59:01.416 --> 59:03.207
Look at the 007 films.

59:03.333 --> 59:06.540
It's always the same script
but they change James Bond.

59:07.291 --> 59:10.832
Well, María changed James Bond and
the script, and that pisses me.

59:10.958 --> 59:14.124
She didn't let me rewrite it
and I'm a fucking scriptwriter!

59:17.208 --> 59:18.290
The worst thing...

59:19.166 --> 59:20.499
The worst thing

59:21.583 --> 59:22.583
is that

59:23.083 --> 59:25.082
while I was listening to them

59:28.208 --> 59:29.457
I started to...

59:33.750 --> 59:34.957
Get aroused?

59:39.958 --> 59:41.624
I've never told anyone this,

59:42.541 --> 59:43.957
but María

59:44.375 --> 59:45.375
likes to

59:45.875 --> 59:47.124
hit me

59:47.375 --> 59:48.790
when she reaches...

59:52.166 --> 59:53.457
When...

59:55.791 --> 59:59.457
I heard her doing it to him
and I couldn't help...

01:00:02.416 --> 01:00:03.915
While they...

01:00:05.958 --> 01:00:07.040
Anyway,

01:00:07.875 --> 01:00:10.665
it was the first time
María and I climaxed together.

01:00:10.791 --> 01:00:14.207
Is there anything
more humiliating than that?

01:00:18.208 --> 01:00:19.208
Look,

01:00:19.458 --> 01:00:22.832
I know your greatest dream
is to summer in Guantanamo,

01:00:22.958 --> 01:00:25.665
but all this isn't your fault.

01:00:26.583 --> 01:00:28.582
Jorge is very good at

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:30.749
removing inhibitions.

01:00:30.916 --> 01:00:31.916
He's dissolute.

01:00:32.458 --> 01:00:34.290
Not dissolute,
take it up a level.

01:00:34.833 --> 01:00:37.832
What is it with people and words?

01:00:38.125 --> 01:00:40.499
Who invented
this shit of "up a level"?

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.957
The next level up from dissolute
has a name.

01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:45.040
"Perverted", for example.

01:00:45.208 --> 01:00:47.540
The next level is "depraved".

01:00:47.833 --> 01:00:50.165
The next level is "sex maniac".

01:00:50.333 --> 01:00:53.374
And the next level
is the Sack of Shit, your ex,

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:56.124
turning my ex
into the hottest porn slut

01:00:56.291 --> 01:00:58.790
in the vilest brothel
in New Orleans!

01:00:59.875 --> 01:01:01.874
- Why New Orleans?
- I don't know!

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.582
It sounded better than Amsterdam.

01:01:03.875 --> 01:01:04.875
Do you know

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:10.249
how many times María did something
with me as progressive as oral sex?

01:01:10.666 --> 01:01:11.666
Very few?

01:01:11.833 --> 01:01:13.915
Not very few,
take it up a level!

01:01:14.958 --> 01:01:17.499
And there I was,
with the phone in my ear,

01:01:17.625 --> 01:01:20.249
listening to how
she gave your ex what he called

01:01:20.375 --> 01:01:23.874
"the best blow job of my life"!

01:01:26.416 --> 01:01:28.499
Now that's a title.
Forget "Hamlet".

01:01:28.958 --> 01:01:32.457
Then María told him all the filthy
things she wanted him to do to her.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.249
You know how many
she and I had done?

01:01:37.791 --> 01:01:39.207
- All of them?
- Not one!

01:01:40.875 --> 01:01:42.332
- Did you ever ask her?
- No!

01:01:42.708 --> 01:01:44.874
- Why not?
- Because I thought...

01:01:44.958 --> 01:01:46.749
Don't think so much!

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.874
I thought she'd see it
as a lack of respect...

01:01:49.958 --> 01:01:53.082
Probably, but perhaps
your lack of respect

01:01:53.250 --> 01:01:56.124
would have driven her wild.
Did you ever think that?

01:01:59.125 --> 01:02:00.499
I couldn't ask her.

01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:04.749
I couldn't say the words, even with
Capote whispering them in my ear.

01:02:05.541 --> 01:02:06.541
No.

01:02:07.291 --> 01:02:08.332
Not Capote.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.665
Bukowski's better for that.

01:02:12.958 --> 01:02:13.958
Try it.

01:02:14.666 --> 01:02:16.665
Imagine I'm your wife,
you're Bukowski,

01:02:16.875 --> 01:02:19.207
and you want
to make endless love to me.

01:02:19.541 --> 01:02:20.541
Action!

01:02:21.041 --> 01:02:22.290
No, no, no.

01:02:25.666 --> 01:02:26.874
This is ridiculous.

01:02:27.958 --> 01:02:28.958
Hey!

01:02:29.666 --> 01:02:31.707
Play with me, Manic Elf.

01:02:56.958 --> 01:02:57.958
María,

01:03:00.708 --> 01:03:01.874
we have to talk.

01:03:02.208 --> 01:03:04.082
Not now, Charles.
I'm reading the Bible.

01:03:09.208 --> 01:03:10.874
I had a win at the racetrack.

01:03:11.375 --> 01:03:15.665
I've drunk two gallons of wine

01:03:16.583 --> 01:03:19.582
and I've just written
"The Fuck Machine."

01:03:20.583 --> 01:03:21.583
Now

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.540
I just want...

01:03:26.041 --> 01:03:28.290
Bukowski would say
"a piece of my ass"

01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:32.665
A generous piece of your fresh ass.

01:03:33.166 --> 01:03:37.332
I want to tear off your clothes,
rip your panties,

01:03:37.458 --> 01:03:38.915
throw myself on you...

01:03:41.041 --> 01:03:42.499
And thrust into me?

01:03:42.875 --> 01:03:45.374
And thrust lecherously into you,

01:03:45.583 --> 01:03:46.665
with euphoria,

01:03:47.583 --> 01:03:49.624
with brute force.

01:03:50.416 --> 01:03:53.624
I want to flatten your body
and drill it

01:03:53.791 --> 01:03:58.957
until fucking Truman Capote
is blushing at the gates of Hell!

01:04:04.791 --> 01:04:05.791
Well?

01:04:18.458 --> 01:04:19.999
I really liked that kiss.

01:04:20.458 --> 01:04:22.290
Wait till I take it up a level!

01:04:47.541 --> 01:04:50.082
I've never slept with anyone
without knowing her name.

01:04:50.583 --> 01:04:52.999
Nor I with an alien
possessed by Bukowski.

01:04:54.125 --> 01:04:57.207
Replacing Capote with Bukowski
was brilliant.

01:04:57.791 --> 01:04:59.511
A substitution
worthy of Vicente del Bosque.

01:05:00.791 --> 01:05:02.540
We needed someone to score.

01:05:06.958 --> 01:05:08.082
Why did we do it?

01:05:09.041 --> 01:05:13.124
Chesterton said that a mystery story
is worthless without a corpse.

01:05:14.333 --> 01:05:17.790
I think the same about a love story
without a good screw.

01:05:19.333 --> 01:05:20.832
Is this a love story?

01:05:21.291 --> 01:05:24.082
Well, it isn't
a paranormal thriller.

01:05:28.583 --> 01:05:29.583
You know what?

01:05:29.958 --> 01:05:31.290
I miss my mistresses.

01:05:32.791 --> 01:05:34.124
Have you had many?

01:05:34.375 --> 01:05:35.375
No.

01:05:35.708 --> 01:05:36.708
Technically, only you.

01:05:37.666 --> 01:05:40.374
I only slept with girlfriends.
That's why I'm saying it.

01:05:40.875 --> 01:05:43.082
I miss the mistresses
I've never had.

01:05:43.958 --> 01:05:45.915
My lovers were very unmissable.

01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:49.957
But we'll drink to all of them.

01:05:53.916 --> 01:05:57.582
To our lovers.

01:06:01.958 --> 01:06:02.999
Carlos?

01:06:05.208 --> 01:06:06.208
Hello, María.

01:06:06.583 --> 01:06:07.583
Jorge!

01:06:08.458 --> 01:06:09.458
Irene.

01:06:09.958 --> 01:06:12.540
- My pleasure, Irene.
- Likewise, Carlos.

01:06:15.958 --> 01:06:17.624
What is going on here?

01:06:19.125 --> 01:06:24.415
Irene is the girl who was left
by the guy for whom you left me.

01:06:24.708 --> 01:06:26.374
I didn't leave you for anyone.

01:06:26.791 --> 01:06:27.791
María,

01:06:28.125 --> 01:06:29.332
you're a cynic.

01:06:30.833 --> 01:06:31.874
A fucking cynic!

01:06:34.291 --> 01:06:35.582
What's so funny?

01:06:36.375 --> 01:06:38.832
Nothing, nothing.
I'm sorry.

01:06:41.416 --> 01:06:43.707
You had to bring him
to our favorite place.

01:06:44.416 --> 01:06:47.499
You brought him here
when you started screwing his wife.

01:06:48.625 --> 01:06:51.540
That's a very bitter metaphor,
especially for you.

01:06:52.666 --> 01:06:54.207
It isn't a metaphor.

01:06:54.625 --> 01:06:56.040
He followed his wife to you

01:06:56.166 --> 01:06:58.999
and then followed you here
the day you left me.

01:06:59.625 --> 01:07:00.832
Now do you get it?

01:07:03.166 --> 01:07:05.165
How long have you been involved?

01:07:06.875 --> 01:07:07.957
About two hours.

01:07:09.250 --> 01:07:10.770
How many months
have you been with him?

01:07:10.958 --> 01:07:12.082
I'm not with him.

01:07:13.458 --> 01:07:16.207
He's just a friend that I met.

01:07:16.916 --> 01:07:19.082
And what you did the other day,
what did he call it?

01:07:19.208 --> 01:07:21.999
Oh, yes!
"The best blow job of my life".

01:07:22.750 --> 01:07:24.374
That was a friendly gesture?

01:07:24.791 --> 01:07:26.957
In two hours you've learned
all about being coarse.

01:07:27.916 --> 01:07:29.876
You didn't give him
the best blow job of his life?

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.249
No, Carlos, no!

01:07:31.375 --> 01:07:33.255
I didn't give him
the best blow job of his life.

01:07:33.791 --> 01:07:34.832
Too bad.

01:07:34.958 --> 01:07:37.040
Because a while ago
his ex gave me mine.

01:07:43.625 --> 01:07:45.665
I wasn't the cause
of their break-up.

01:07:46.041 --> 01:07:47.041
Who was?

01:07:47.250 --> 01:07:48.250
Yoko Ono?

01:07:50.125 --> 01:07:54.040
Irene, you don't have to consult
the entire works of Freud

01:07:54.166 --> 01:07:55.874
to see that
their relationship is dead.

01:07:57.250 --> 01:08:00.832
Jorge,
this may be terrible for your ego,

01:08:00.958 --> 01:08:04.040
but reading a book on psychology
doesn't make you into Freud,

01:08:04.208 --> 01:08:07.707
just like watching soccer on the TV
doesn't make you into Messi.

01:08:07.833 --> 01:08:09.040
So don't try to be smart.

01:08:09.375 --> 01:08:12.415
If you hadn't stuck your little dick
into that relationship,

01:08:12.583 --> 01:08:15.665
I think they'd still be together,
and maybe even happy.

01:08:16.207 --> 01:08:17.415
Stop denying it.

01:08:17.875 --> 01:08:19.374
It's too pathetic.

01:08:20.082 --> 01:08:23.874
When I rang, and you called me
a common paranoid,

01:08:24.207 --> 01:08:26.207
you didn't hang up properly.
I heard everything.

01:08:26.957 --> 01:08:27.957
No.

01:08:28.957 --> 01:08:31.499
I don't know
what you think you heard,

01:08:31.666 --> 01:08:33.832
- what you imagine, but...
- This.

01:08:33.957 --> 01:08:35.832
It was probably a crossed line.

01:08:37.291 --> 01:08:38.291
That isn't me.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.124
You know that.

01:08:40.250 --> 01:08:41.749
<i>María... María...</i>

01:08:42.166 --> 01:08:43.207
<i>María...</i>

01:08:43.957 --> 01:08:46.749
You're right, it's not you.
Forgive me.

01:08:47.207 --> 01:08:49.707
- I'm a common paranoid.
- Stop it.

01:08:49.916 --> 01:08:50.916
Turn it off!

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.374
What is there between you two?

01:08:59.457 --> 01:09:00.457
I'm fine.

01:09:01.250 --> 01:09:02.250
What?

01:09:03.082 --> 01:09:05.124
You asked me the other day,
remember?

01:09:06.457 --> 01:09:09.290
Don't worry about me.
I'm fine.

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:17.790
You hate me.

01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:20.500
Not you.

01:09:21.707 --> 01:09:24.165
But I'm not too fond
of the girl in the recording.

01:09:29.457 --> 01:09:31.124
One day I woke up,

01:09:32.041 --> 01:09:33.749
I looked around and...

01:09:35.332 --> 01:09:37.082
I felt I wasn't alive.

01:09:38.582 --> 01:09:39.957
That same day, he appeared.

01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:41.500
Why him?

01:09:42.166 --> 01:09:43.207
Why not?

01:09:44.875 --> 01:09:46.374
It could have been anyone.

01:09:47.041 --> 01:09:48.415
Anyone who wasn't you.

01:09:49.541 --> 01:09:53.332
Thank you for that morale booster.
Ask me again if I hate you.

01:09:53.832 --> 01:09:55.793
- I'm not saying this to hurt you.
- Just as well!

01:09:56.041 --> 01:09:58.082
- Do you want the truth or not?
- No.

01:10:00.791 --> 01:10:01.915
But tell me.

01:10:04.166 --> 01:10:08.415
Seeing you with her
suddenly made me feel alive.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.582
- Where's the logic in that?
- There is none.

01:10:14.333 --> 01:10:17.332
I'm not trying to be logical
but it's like...

01:10:18.583 --> 01:10:21.749
It's like I gave away my car
to buy one that's faster

01:10:21.875 --> 01:10:23.249
but really it's worse.

01:10:23.958 --> 01:10:27.999
"Give me 24 hours to prove I'm the
woman of your dreams" worked better.

01:10:30.166 --> 01:10:31.915
Would you give them to me again?

01:10:36.041 --> 01:10:37.665
What can they be talking about?

01:10:39.416 --> 01:10:41.790
About how wonderful you are.

01:10:43.791 --> 01:10:46.582
Thank you for your irony.
It's just what I need.

01:10:47.708 --> 01:10:48.708
Look,

01:10:49.208 --> 01:10:51.540
they've been together eight years,
they have a daughter.

01:10:52.083 --> 01:10:53.790
What do you think
they're talking about?

01:10:56.958 --> 01:10:58.082
How's Laura?

01:11:00.833 --> 01:11:02.040
She misses you.

01:11:02.791 --> 01:11:04.957
You tell better stories than I do.

01:11:12.250 --> 01:11:13.415
Do you think they'll make up?

01:11:14.416 --> 01:11:17.082
It isn't easy
to put an end to eight years.

01:11:17.833 --> 01:11:18.999
Even for you.

01:11:20.958 --> 01:11:23.665
It's hard to believe
you ever loved me,

01:11:24.250 --> 01:11:25.957
to judge by your words.

01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:29.540
It's impossible to believe
that you ever loved me,

01:11:29.666 --> 01:11:31.332
to judge by your actions.

01:11:34.916 --> 01:11:36.249
You, Sack,

01:11:37.041 --> 01:11:38.540
go out and talk to her.

01:11:41.208 --> 01:11:42.415
It's over, isn't it?

01:11:44.541 --> 01:11:45.957
I loved you, Jorge.

01:11:47.458 --> 01:11:48.624
I loved you.

01:12:07.083 --> 01:12:08.207
Nice moment.

01:12:09.416 --> 01:12:10.499
Thank you.

01:12:12.625 --> 01:12:13.625
Was that goodbye?

01:12:15.541 --> 01:12:16.541
Yes.

01:12:18.125 --> 01:12:19.874
I thought about going back

01:12:20.708 --> 01:12:23.124
but I reminded myself too much
of Ditsy and Bozo.

01:12:32.208 --> 01:12:34.082
What can your wife be telling him?

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.582
That she saw me kissing a cutie,

01:12:36.708 --> 01:12:39.582
the kind that would make even
the Pope become a crack dealer,

01:12:39.708 --> 01:12:41.665
and she went mad with jealousy.

01:12:43.416 --> 01:12:44.582
I told you.

01:12:44.958 --> 01:12:46.332
She wants back with you?

01:12:47.958 --> 01:12:49.457
Yes, she suggested it.

01:12:51.208 --> 01:12:52.208
You see?

01:12:53.041 --> 01:12:55.790
That's why I forbade you
to fall in love with me.

01:12:56.916 --> 01:12:59.040
Imagine the mess you'd be in now!

01:13:00.375 --> 01:13:02.332
I've got a pretty good idea.

01:13:06.250 --> 01:13:07.374
Any questions?

01:13:10.333 --> 01:13:11.707
All real clichés.

01:13:13.208 --> 01:13:14.540
Shall I ask and you answer?

01:13:15.625 --> 01:13:16.707
It's a deal.

01:13:18.666 --> 01:13:20.165
Am I going back to her?

01:13:22.625 --> 01:13:24.207
Your head thinks

01:13:24.625 --> 01:13:27.207
your daughter and your marriage
deserve another attempt.

01:13:29.208 --> 01:13:32.040
And what does my heart say?

01:13:33.708 --> 01:13:35.332
That you should listen to your head.

01:13:41.666 --> 01:13:43.082
Will we miss each other?

01:13:45.291 --> 01:13:47.624
Every time we drink to our lovers.

01:13:50.708 --> 01:13:52.832
Because I won't see you again,
will I?

01:13:54.708 --> 01:13:56.332
She wouldn't understand.

01:13:59.250 --> 01:14:03.415
But it isn't unusual for Pixies
and Elves to meet in dreams.

01:14:15.333 --> 01:14:17.249
I hate soppy endings.

01:14:24.083 --> 01:14:25.665
But don't forget me, OK?

01:14:29.208 --> 01:14:32.040
I never forget a girl
who's impossible to forget.

01:14:33.458 --> 01:14:35.290
That's a good last line.

01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:44.082
"That's a good last line"?
She said that?

01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:46.665
She said that.

01:14:48.208 --> 01:14:51.415
I'll write it down, because
that really is a good last line.

01:14:51.541 --> 01:14:52.749
She made an elegant exit,

01:14:53.833 --> 01:14:54.957
with class.

01:14:55.666 --> 01:14:57.499
She even said goodbye to María.

01:14:58.166 --> 01:14:59.290
She's got guts.

01:15:00.041 --> 01:15:03.374
And before she left, she gave me
a list of her ten favorite books.

01:15:03.916 --> 01:15:06.874
Even though I had some already,
I bought them all.

01:15:08.666 --> 01:15:09.666
Do you regret it?

01:15:10.916 --> 01:15:11.916
Buying books I had?

01:15:13.166 --> 01:15:15.457
Letting the one
who recommended them get away.

01:15:17.208 --> 01:15:18.624
If I told you the truth,

01:15:18.875 --> 01:15:20.165
I'd be lying.

01:15:22.166 --> 01:15:23.790
I'll write that down too.

01:15:24.708 --> 01:15:27.415
Fuck! I know
you can't have everything.

01:15:27.666 --> 01:15:30.457
I know that. But it shouldn't
have ended like this.

01:15:30.750 --> 01:15:32.040
We still had a month!

01:15:32.208 --> 01:15:35.374
Do you know what we would have
done in a month?

01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:36.999
Yes, made the video clip.

01:15:38.958 --> 01:15:40.124
What video clip?

01:15:40.708 --> 01:15:44.249
The one with music by, for example,
Norah Jones, with happy images.

01:15:45.125 --> 01:15:46.832
Irene and you
eating face in the park,

01:15:46.958 --> 01:15:49.915
laughing in the rain,
"we're falling in love" stuff.

01:15:50.041 --> 01:15:51.041
That shit.

01:15:52.208 --> 01:15:53.208
<i>Shall we play?</i>

01:15:54.416 --> 01:15:57.415
<i>It isn't unusual for
Pixies and Elves to meet in dreams.</i>

01:15:57.541 --> 01:15:59.582
<i>Am I a Manic Pixie Dream Girl?</i>

01:15:59.833 --> 01:16:02.874
<i>That's why I forbade you
to fall in love with me.</i>

01:16:02.958 --> 01:16:04.332
<i>Will we miss each other?</i>

01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:06.457
<i>Every time we drink to our lovers.</i>

01:16:06.583 --> 01:16:08.476
<i>I never forget a girl
who's impossible to forget.</i>

01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:09.624
<i>I see the happy ending.</i>

01:16:09.750 --> 01:16:12.040
<i>The two of you kissing,
like the Lovers of Teruel.</i>

01:16:39.166 --> 01:16:40.457
DITSY BOZO

01:16:40.916 --> 01:16:44.915
Cut!

01:16:45.333 --> 01:16:46.333
Fuck!

01:16:46.666 --> 01:16:48.249
I wanted my video clip!

01:16:50.208 --> 01:16:54.499
Why can't I have my video clip?

01:16:55.625 --> 01:16:56.957
Because that's in movies!

01:16:57.333 --> 01:17:00.415
Real life has no video clips and
Norah Jones doesn't sing for you!

01:17:00.750 --> 01:17:03.624
In real life, you're happy with your
lover, your wife appears with hers,

01:17:03.791 --> 01:17:04.999
and everything's fucked!

01:17:06.708 --> 01:17:07.708
Yeah.

01:17:09.625 --> 01:17:12.374
In real life, María is a viper

01:17:13.541 --> 01:17:15.249
and she's marvelous too.

01:17:19.041 --> 01:17:21.040
You've got too many things in there.

01:17:34.666 --> 01:17:36.332
Why have I gone back to María?

01:17:36.458 --> 01:17:37.540
I'll explain it to you.

01:17:40.750 --> 01:17:42.832
Young people fall in love
at first sight.

01:17:43.083 --> 01:17:46.374
Romeo and Juliet see each other
and, wham, they're in love.

01:17:46.750 --> 01:17:47.957
That's all it takes.

01:17:48.208 --> 01:17:50.082
When you're older,
you question everything.

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:51.749
"Am I in love or just horny?"

01:17:51.958 --> 01:17:54.624
"What if, after a month,
she tells me to fuck off?"

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.874
"What if I get bored
after 100 screws?"

01:17:56.958 --> 01:17:59.374
So, just in case,
you let her get away.

01:17:59.958 --> 01:18:00.958
Look,

01:18:01.208 --> 01:18:02.874
you decided on María because...

01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:04.582
because...

01:18:05.083 --> 01:18:07.957
Because I don't think
I'm in love with Irene?

01:18:08.875 --> 01:18:10.665
Is that what you're trying to say?

01:18:11.375 --> 01:18:13.082
If I say
what I'm thinking of saying,

01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:15.874
I'm regretting it already.

01:18:16.875 --> 01:18:19.165
What crap.
I'm not writing that down.

01:18:19.541 --> 01:18:20.541
Look,

01:18:21.875 --> 01:18:25.624
I'm a practical guy,
I'm not passionate or romantic.

01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:27.082
- I'm not!
- Not romantic?

01:18:27.375 --> 01:18:28.124
No!

01:18:28.291 --> 01:18:29.999
You're an incurable romantic.

01:18:30.208 --> 01:18:32.415
So romantic that
all the love in the real world

01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:35.665
won't match your romanticism.
That's your tragedy,

01:18:35.958 --> 01:18:36.999
among many others.

01:18:37.333 --> 01:18:38.915
- Among many others?
- Exactly.

01:18:39.083 --> 01:18:40.083
Such as?

01:18:40.208 --> 01:18:41.208
María.

01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:43.707
- She's my wife...
- I screwed her.

01:18:45.875 --> 01:18:48.124
- What did you say?
- I screwed her.

01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:50.500
No.

01:18:51.208 --> 01:18:53.874
Remember when you went to Ibiza
to discuss "Ditsy and Bozo 2"?

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:55.957
- No.
- That night María invited me

01:18:56.125 --> 01:18:57.707
for dinner
and then seduced me

01:18:57.833 --> 01:18:59.957
while your daughter
was sleeping in the next room.

01:19:00.083 --> 01:19:02.290
<i>No. No. No.</i>

01:19:02.791 --> 01:19:05.290
<i>She said something
that made it very clear.</i>

01:19:05.958 --> 01:19:09.165
Give me two hours to show you
I'm the best lover you've ever had.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Sound familiar?

01:19:21.583 --> 01:19:25.874
No, no, no, no, no...

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.600
- Why would I lie to you?
- I don't know.

01:19:27.750 --> 01:19:29.582
I don't believe you.
I don't care.

01:19:29.958 --> 01:19:32.832
We can talk about the two wallops
she gave me when she had her...

01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:34.665
You know when.

01:19:36.166 --> 01:19:37.582
It's true!

01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:39.500
You did it!

01:19:40.541 --> 01:19:43.499
But because of those wallops
everything went south.

01:19:45.791 --> 01:19:46.832
No!

01:19:53.625 --> 01:19:56.290
Tell me you resisted a bit.
Tell me.

01:19:56.458 --> 01:20:00.374
Yes, when it was obvious that
María was giving me the come-on

01:20:00.750 --> 01:20:03.915
<i>I said a subtle phrase I have
for scaring off persistent women.</i>

01:20:04.375 --> 01:20:05.375
<i>What is it?</i>

01:20:05.583 --> 01:20:07.540
I think my dick's gone to sleep.

01:20:09.833 --> 01:20:11.749
It goes straight
to the subconscious.

01:20:11.875 --> 01:20:13.874
I say it, and they leave me alone.

01:20:13.958 --> 01:20:14.958
But María kept attacking

01:20:15.291 --> 01:20:17.999
<i>and I tried to keep my distance.
I said to her:</i>

01:20:18.250 --> 01:20:19.749
Is this a good idea?

01:20:19.875 --> 01:20:20.875
What did she say?

01:20:21.791 --> 01:20:23.540
You're Carlos' best friend.

01:20:24.375 --> 01:20:26.124
Who'd treat me better than you?

01:20:28.416 --> 01:20:31.457
If you think about it,
it was very logical.

01:20:32.208 --> 01:20:33.208
Look,

01:20:34.041 --> 01:20:37.082
I'm feeling like
I would really love to thump you!

01:20:38.583 --> 01:20:39.983
What the hell
are you trying to say?

01:20:40.166 --> 01:20:43.790
Saying no to María would have been
an insult to her and to you.

01:20:44.125 --> 01:20:45.665
To me? Explain that!

01:20:45.958 --> 01:20:50.457
It's like saying: "Your wife isn't
hot enough for me to betray you",

01:20:50.583 --> 01:20:51.583
or saying she's ugly,

01:20:51.791 --> 01:20:55.665
or insinuating
our friendship isn't strong enough

01:20:55.875 --> 01:20:58.249
- to survive this shit.
- Don't twist things!

01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:00.999
My best friend should never
screw my wife! Never!

01:21:01.291 --> 01:21:04.790
Only your best friend would tell you
he did it in these circumstances.

01:21:05.041 --> 01:21:08.124
Why tell me? I didn't want to know.
I didn't need to know.

01:21:08.291 --> 01:21:11.457
No! You didn't want to know,
but you needed to know.

01:21:21.916 --> 01:21:23.082
- Do it.
- Do what?

01:21:23.625 --> 01:21:25.999
Hit me. Didn't you want to?
Well, go on.

01:21:26.125 --> 01:21:27.125
Why?

01:21:27.791 --> 01:21:30.499
Maybe you've forgotten,
but I screwed your wife.

01:21:31.125 --> 01:21:32.207
How will hitting you help?

01:21:32.458 --> 01:21:34.832
I don't know!
But it makes sense.

01:21:35.125 --> 01:21:38.290
The real world is shit and we should
start living like our characters.

01:21:38.750 --> 01:21:41.165
- Like Ditsy and Bozo?
- No, like the good ones,

01:21:41.291 --> 01:21:42.832
the ones we haven't written yet.

01:21:42.958 --> 01:21:46.165
A good character would hit me now
and then we'd carry on talking,

01:21:46.291 --> 01:21:47.731
me bleeding like an anti-hero and...

01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:06.624
That's great!

01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:08.665
Thanks, man.

01:22:10.875 --> 01:22:11.875
Did I hurt you?

01:22:12.750 --> 01:22:15.915
María hurt me more.
You want to hit me twice?

01:22:17.833 --> 01:22:19.374
I didn't want to hit you once.

01:22:34.333 --> 01:22:35.415
Look,

01:22:36.125 --> 01:22:37.749
your wife isn't a bad person.

01:22:39.375 --> 01:22:42.175
You can spend the rest of your life
with her and be more or less happy.

01:22:42.666 --> 01:22:46.582
Accept that occasionally she'll
establish her "areas of freedom".

01:22:47.333 --> 01:22:48.915
You just do the same.

01:22:50.166 --> 01:22:53.540
If you can live with those wallops,
you can live with this.

01:22:55.041 --> 01:22:56.041
Your pal,

01:22:56.208 --> 01:22:59.749
Truman Capote, would write
a hell of a story about you two.

01:22:59.875 --> 01:23:02.790
A bit sad, yes,
but a hell of a story.

01:23:05.541 --> 01:23:06.541
Well?

01:23:09.041 --> 01:23:10.207
What'll you do?

01:23:19.125 --> 01:23:20.125
Hey,

01:23:23.583 --> 01:23:26.415
your suitcase has just said
the best last line in history.

01:24:03.958 --> 01:24:05.124
Is this chance?

01:24:08.958 --> 01:24:11.665
How did you know I'd be here?
I haven't come for a week.

01:24:12.625 --> 01:24:13.625
Yeah.

01:24:14.416 --> 01:24:16.874
I came the day after
we said goodbye.

01:24:18.166 --> 01:24:20.749
I waited a few hours, and I left.

01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:25.915
I told you it was a bad idea
not to swap phone numbers.

01:24:27.166 --> 01:24:29.249
That's why
I gave mine to the waiter.

01:24:30.375 --> 01:24:32.540
So he could call me
when you appeared.

01:24:34.083 --> 01:24:35.083
You know,

01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:37.040
Bukowski and Capote

01:24:37.958 --> 01:24:38.958
have started talking.

01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:41.500
I'm glad.

01:24:41.916 --> 01:24:45.665
And they both agree
I have to tell you something.

01:24:46.875 --> 01:24:48.290
I won't sugarcoat it.

01:24:48.916 --> 01:24:51.124
If you have to say something tough,
you say it.

01:24:53.416 --> 01:24:54.540
Go ahead.

01:24:56.541 --> 01:24:59.957
I love you.

01:25:04.166 --> 01:25:05.957
You've copied Jorge's method.

01:25:08.750 --> 01:25:10.999
He took my girl
by copying Oscar Wilde,

01:25:11.666 --> 01:25:13.874
I can take his by copying him.

01:25:14.916 --> 01:25:16.624
How do you know I'm back with him?

01:25:18.833 --> 01:25:21.415
- You're back with Sack of Shit?
- Yes.

01:25:22.041 --> 01:25:24.749
In fact, he's due any minute.
You can say hello.

01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:27.500
Seriously?

01:25:30.333 --> 01:25:31.333
Fuck!

01:25:32.958 --> 01:25:34.582
I haven't seen him since then.

01:25:34.750 --> 01:25:36.310
How could we get back
after what I said?

01:25:36.750 --> 01:25:37.957
It wouldn't be the first time.

01:25:38.333 --> 01:25:41.165
The first and only time we got back

01:25:41.291 --> 01:25:45.290
it took him three days to persuade
me, three days nagging at me.

01:25:45.583 --> 01:25:47.707
María got you back in three minutes.

01:25:48.083 --> 01:25:49.083
Not exactly.

01:25:49.375 --> 01:25:50.499
How many? Two?

01:25:50.958 --> 01:25:52.749
I never went back to her.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.290
I kind of thought that.

01:26:01.250 --> 01:26:04.124
I mean,
when you said "I love you"...

01:26:04.750 --> 01:26:05.832
Suspicious, right?

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.165
A bit.

01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:10.500
What happened?

01:26:14.416 --> 01:26:15.540
May I use a metaphor?

01:26:16.291 --> 01:26:18.957
I would never
inhibit your creativity.

01:26:21.750 --> 01:26:26.707
At times, when you write a script,
it's hard to know when to stop.

01:26:28.083 --> 01:26:30.457
You've reached the end
but you don't realize,

01:26:30.916 --> 01:26:34.582
so you keep on and on,
trying to find the perfect ending.

01:26:36.041 --> 01:26:38.082
And all you do is ruin everything.

01:26:40.541 --> 01:26:42.499
My story with María
finished long ago,

01:26:43.333 --> 01:26:45.207
but I couldn't see the ending.

01:26:51.166 --> 01:26:52.999
And what about our story?

01:26:54.375 --> 01:26:56.082
We should keep writing it.

01:26:57.458 --> 01:26:59.040
And see where it takes us.

01:27:03.125 --> 01:27:04.665
It seems like a good plan.

01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:08.624
Are there rules?

01:27:09.208 --> 01:27:10.208
No.

01:27:10.958 --> 01:27:12.540
Just that we keep playing,

01:27:13.625 --> 01:27:14.665
Manic Pixie.

01:27:16.916 --> 01:27:18.290
Let's keep playing,

01:27:18.583 --> 01:27:20.290
Manic Elf.
