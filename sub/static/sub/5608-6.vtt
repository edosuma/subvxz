WEBVTT

00:03.131 --> 00:04.730
(indistinct chatter, shouting)

00:08.570 --> 00:11.003
(siren wailing in distance)

00:11.005 --> 00:13.573
It's time to end the abuse!

00:13.575 --> 00:15.708
Stop police brutality!
What do we want?!

00:15.710 --> 00:17.276
PROTESTORS: Justice!
When do we want it?

00:17.278 --> 00:18.778
PROTESTORS: Now!
What do we want?

00:18.780 --> 00:20.246
PROTESTORS: Justice!
When do we want it?

00:20.248 --> 00:21.447
PROTESTORS: Now!

00:21.449 --> 00:23.950
I thought they were supposed
to stay on the walkways.

00:23.952 --> 00:26.385
They are, but they're
looking for trouble.

00:26.387 --> 00:28.554
And headlines.
The right to protest, Eddie.

00:28.556 --> 00:31.324
As American as apple pie
and bitching about taxes.

00:31.326 --> 00:32.925
But we're not the bad guys.

00:32.927 --> 00:34.293
Preaching to
the choir.

00:34.295 --> 00:36.262
So is Reverend Potter.
We're sending a message

00:36.264 --> 00:39.098
to those in power!
Whose streets?

00:39.100 --> 00:40.232
PROTESTORS:
Our streets!

00:40.234 --> 00:41.968
Whose streets?
PROTESTORS: Our streets!

00:41.970 --> 00:43.703
Who's the other guy
with the bullhorn?

00:43.705 --> 00:45.905
That's Gerry Guerrero,
civil rights attorney.

00:45.907 --> 00:48.341
Suing the NYPD in
half a dozen cases.

00:48.343 --> 00:50.910
Not a favorite
of the commissioner's.

00:53.281 --> 00:55.915
Your people need to be over
on the walkways, Reverend.

00:55.917 --> 00:57.950
Uh, Officer,
we have permits.

00:57.952 --> 00:59.418
Not to block a
government plaza.

00:59.420 --> 01:01.387
These cars need to move
in case of an emergency.

01:01.389 --> 01:02.521
Folks, behind the barricade,

01:02.523 --> 01:04.557
please.
MAN: What is going on here?

01:04.559 --> 01:06.826
Back up! Back up! Get behind
Hey, is someone videotaping this?

01:06.828 --> 01:07.793
the barricade!

01:07.795 --> 01:08.828
(overlapping shouting)

01:08.830 --> 01:10.963
JANKO:
Get behind the barricade!

01:10.965 --> 01:12.665
Hey! No! Back up!
Get behind the barricade!

01:12.667 --> 01:15.067
What is going on here?
Is someone recording this?!

01:15.069 --> 01:17.236
JANKO:
Back up!

01:17.238 --> 01:18.371
What about our rights?

01:18.373 --> 01:21.007
JANKO:
Back up!

01:21.009 --> 01:22.274
Ma'am, you can't be here
right now.

01:22.276 --> 01:23.943
You need to be back
behind the barricades.

01:23.945 --> 01:25.945
I want to join the group.
This is a government plaza.

01:25.947 --> 01:27.113
It's off-limits right now.

01:27.138 --> 01:28.016
You guys have to be back...
The group is right here.

01:28.016 --> 01:29.548
back behind
the barricades.

01:29.550 --> 01:30.549
Please...

01:30.551 --> 01:31.584
(indistinct shouting)

01:31.586 --> 01:33.619
Hey. Excuse...
Hey, slow down!

01:35.623 --> 01:38.457
(bystanders gasping, chattering)

01:38.459 --> 01:39.759
Hey! Sir!

01:39.761 --> 01:41.060
Sir!

01:43.364 --> 01:46.232
Sir. Hey,
talk to me.

01:46.234 --> 01:48.234
Call a bus.
We need a bus...

01:48.236 --> 01:50.469
This man needs immediate medical attention.
You see that?

01:50.471 --> 01:52.405
Dude just belted that dude
for no reason.

01:52.407 --> 01:54.774
No, that's not what happened.
He was about to run into a woman

01:54.776 --> 01:56.575
and a kid.

01:56.577 --> 01:57.643
You saw, right, Eddie?

01:57.645 --> 01:59.311
No, I was over there.

01:59.313 --> 02:00.946
GUERRERO:
Officer,

02:00.948 --> 02:03.049
I need to see your badge
number and your name.

02:04.552 --> 02:06.252
Reagan?

02:06.254 --> 02:08.954
That's your name?
You're Reagan?

02:14.762 --> 02:16.562
"Footsteps on an empty street,

02:16.564 --> 02:18.197
"who you think you gonna meet?

02:18.199 --> 02:21.233
"Science dropped
when my nine popped,

02:21.235 --> 02:23.035
"I tanned that G on the back

02:23.037 --> 02:26.472
"of his head, then I sparked
his ass twice, made sure

02:26.474 --> 02:28.140
he was dead."

02:28.142 --> 02:29.375
(laughter)

02:29.377 --> 02:31.277
Your Honor,
all due respect

02:31.279 --> 02:32.878
to Ms. Reagan's
rapping skills,

02:32.880 --> 02:35.514
we object. She's
quoting from a hit song

02:35.516 --> 02:37.983
my client wrote,
not a confession.

02:37.985 --> 02:39.518
ERIN: Your Honor, it's
the same thing.

02:39.520 --> 02:43.522
The defendant releases a song
under the name Chuck McMurda,

02:43.524 --> 02:45.524
explicitly taking credit
for the shooting

02:45.526 --> 02:50.129
of Anthony "Science" Reynolds on
West 134th Street on February 2.

02:50.131 --> 02:52.832
Haven't you ever heard
of artistic license?

02:52.834 --> 02:55.601
You're confusing the artist
with the crime he's describing.

02:55.603 --> 02:58.104
The defendant was in a dispute
with the victim.

02:58.106 --> 03:00.539
Witnesses place him
in the vicinity of the shooting.

03:00.541 --> 03:02.441
The gun was found
in his apartment.

03:02.443 --> 03:04.243
MAN: Someone else put
it there. It's not

03:04.245 --> 03:05.478
just my client's prints on it.

03:05.480 --> 03:06.846
There were details in that song

03:06.848 --> 03:08.614
that only
the killer could have known.

03:08.616 --> 03:10.316
JUDGE:
Let's have a sidebar.

03:10.318 --> 03:11.751
Approach.

03:15.423 --> 03:17.456
Judge, allowing this in
as evidence

03:17.458 --> 03:18.791
sets a dangerous precedent.

03:18.793 --> 03:21.093
Ms. Reagan, I don't disagree.

03:21.095 --> 03:22.361
What about
the First Amendment?

03:22.363 --> 03:25.264
No one is denying the
defendant free speech.

03:25.266 --> 03:27.266
We're just asking for
the right to include

03:27.268 --> 03:29.068
as public admission
of guilt in the case.

03:29.070 --> 03:30.936
And without it,
most of your evidence

03:30.938 --> 03:33.606
is entirely circumstantial.
You have no witnesses,

03:33.608 --> 03:35.775
so you're using a song
to try to tie the rest

03:35.777 --> 03:37.810
of your case together.
I do need to see more,

03:37.812 --> 03:40.780
Ms. Reagan. Otherwise,
I'm inclined to support

03:40.782 --> 03:43.582
the motion to dismiss this case
before it goes

03:43.584 --> 03:45.050
to trial.

03:53.628 --> 03:56.162
We're calling
for a federal investigation.

03:56.164 --> 03:58.964
The victim of this unprovoked
assault is still unconscious

03:58.966 --> 04:00.533
in the intensive care unit.

04:00.535 --> 04:02.334
We don't know
how long he'll be there.

04:02.336 --> 04:03.636
And for the record,

04:03.638 --> 04:07.339
the officer responsible
is one Jamie Reagan.

04:07.341 --> 04:08.391
(groaning, booing)

04:08.415 --> 04:10.868
That's the brother of Detective
Danny Reagan, who's been

04:10.871 --> 04:13.538
the subject of numerous
brutality complaints himself.

04:13.540 --> 04:15.607
Yeah. And both
are the sons

04:15.609 --> 04:17.242
of the police commissioner.
(groaning)

04:17.244 --> 04:21.579
Ladies and gentlemen, this city
used to have crime families

04:21.582 --> 04:24.483
called Bonanno, Gambino,
(sounds of agreement)

04:24.485 --> 04:26.218
Colombo.

04:26.220 --> 04:28.386
Well, now we have
the Reagans!

04:28.388 --> 04:30.555
(booing)

04:35.529 --> 04:37.295
They're here.

04:40.267 --> 04:42.134
You see it?
Yeah.

04:42.136 --> 04:43.969
They're very good
at what they do.

04:43.971 --> 04:45.670
They're going after my family.

04:45.672 --> 04:48.140
And getting your attention
and getting under your skin,

04:48.142 --> 04:49.281
which is exactly what...

04:49.305 --> 04:51.277
This is the freedom of speech
we're sworn to protect?

04:51.278 --> 04:52.611
I think we
need to put out

04:52.613 --> 04:53.879
a neutral statement.

04:53.881 --> 04:55.847
The rider's in the hospital
with a skull fracture.

04:55.849 --> 04:57.716
And even with the video
from the government buildings,

04:57.718 --> 04:59.417
it's not clear
what Jamie did.

04:59.419 --> 05:00.785
He was protecting

05:00.787 --> 05:03.188
protestors who shouldn't
have been in that area.

05:03.190 --> 05:05.323
Potter and Guerrero are
setting up for another lawsuit.

05:05.325 --> 05:08.293
They're throwing crap against
the wall to see if it sticks.

05:08.295 --> 05:10.595
And based on that video they put
out, some crap might stick.

05:10.597 --> 05:13.698
Oh, they got ways of editing
with those things. They make

05:13.700 --> 05:14.666
anyone look guilty.

05:14.668 --> 05:15.901
Both
of you,

05:15.903 --> 05:18.837
please take the earplugs out.
There's a lot of

05:18.839 --> 05:21.006
legitimate use of force
questions nationally.

05:21.008 --> 05:24.209
Us not taking this seriously
isn't gonna make it go away.

05:24.211 --> 05:25.510
So, what, we cave?

05:25.512 --> 05:27.712
(sighs)
Potter and Guerrero are right

05:27.714 --> 05:31.483
in one sense only:
nobody gets to be above the law.

05:31.485 --> 05:33.919
Turn it over to the DA,
have IAB conduct

05:33.921 --> 05:36.254
a parallel investigation,
no holds barred.

05:37.391 --> 05:39.958
I don't see
that I have a choice here, Sid.

05:39.960 --> 05:41.927
Could be hard to get
those horses back in the barn

05:41.929 --> 05:43.028
once we let 'em out.

05:43.030 --> 05:44.496
I know that.

05:44.498 --> 05:46.798
And that's all the press gets
for now.

05:46.800 --> 05:48.200
That's it?

05:48.202 --> 05:52.470
Unless you want to say
I hate my job.

That's them.
Yes. How can I help you?

06:27.989 --> 06:32.025
Ms. Reagan, could we
speak to you in private?

06:32.027 --> 06:33.560
Wh-What is this about?

06:33.562 --> 06:36.596
We have evidence that affects
the Chuck McMurda case.

06:36.598 --> 06:39.432
I'm Alan Murtagh.
This is my wife, Cynthia.

06:39.434 --> 06:41.801
We drove down from
Westchester for the hearing.

06:41.803 --> 06:43.937
Charles is innocent.

06:43.939 --> 06:46.439
He couldn't have done
what you're accusing him of.

06:46.441 --> 06:49.809
He was with us the night
of the shooting.

06:49.811 --> 06:52.345
Why didn't you come forward earlier?
He doesn't want anyone

06:52.347 --> 06:53.913
to know about us.

06:53.915 --> 06:56.216
I'm sorry, who are you?

06:56.218 --> 06:59.119
We're his parents.

07:00.455 --> 07:04.491
Nothing our son says
about himself is true.

07:04.493 --> 07:06.826
He's as white as we are.

07:06.828 --> 07:09.062
I don't understand.

07:09.064 --> 07:12.432
He made up this myth
about himself.

07:12.434 --> 07:15.535
He grew up in the suburbs,
not the ghetto.

07:15.537 --> 07:17.337
And began lying
about where he was from.

07:17.339 --> 07:19.939
We thought
it was just rebellion.

07:19.941 --> 07:22.342
When he was 12,
he told us he'd...

07:22.344 --> 07:25.111
always felt more black
than white.

07:25.113 --> 07:26.813
Trans-whatever.

07:26.815 --> 07:29.716
It doesn't seem so extreme
these days.

07:29.718 --> 07:31.885
Now he's got the record company
encouraging him

07:31.887 --> 07:34.287
to put these lies
to music.

07:34.289 --> 07:36.489
They've kept him away from us.

07:36.491 --> 07:38.825
They're paying for his lawyer.

07:38.827 --> 07:42.162
Alan, Cynthia, your son...

07:42.164 --> 07:44.597
is accused of murder.

07:44.599 --> 07:46.699
He bragged about
it in a song.

07:46.701 --> 07:48.301
He's just trying
to sell records.

07:48.303 --> 07:50.904
Or however
you make money now.

07:50.906 --> 07:53.306
He was with us,
celebrating my birthday

07:53.308 --> 07:54.941
the night of this murder.

07:54.943 --> 07:57.944
Then why wouldn't he offer you
as an alibi?

07:57.946 --> 08:00.213
Because he's ashamed.

08:00.215 --> 08:02.815
He told me he would find
someone with more...

08:02.817 --> 08:05.385
"street cred"
to cover for him.

08:05.387 --> 08:07.687
But now that it's getting
all this publicity,

08:07.689 --> 08:10.890
we knew we had to get involved
before he hurts his own cause.

08:10.892 --> 08:13.193
Can you prove
that he was with you that night?

08:13.195 --> 08:17.163
He made us delete
all the photographs.

08:17.165 --> 08:20.633
So it's just your word?

08:22.637 --> 08:24.837
(door shuts)

08:26.241 --> 08:28.274
This a good time?

08:28.276 --> 08:29.709
Yeah. We still got

08:29.711 --> 08:32.712
15... no, 18 minutes
till it starts.

08:32.714 --> 08:34.681
What starts?
The restored print

08:34.683 --> 08:36.883
of <i> Chinatown.</i>
It's playing at that art house

08:36.885 --> 08:38.116
off of Fourth Avenue.

08:38.119 --> 08:40.053
That's not why I came out here.

08:40.054 --> 08:42.020
I know why you came out here.

08:42.023 --> 08:43.356
That's why I'm thinking movie.

08:43.357 --> 08:45.291
Otherwise, you made the trip
for nothing.

08:45.293 --> 08:47.393
So you won't even listen?

08:47.395 --> 08:49.362
If you haven't seen <i> Chinatown</i>
on the big screen, you haven't seen it.

08:49.364 --> 08:51.598
I got my modified assignment,
Dad.

08:51.600 --> 08:54.234
Clearly, I know that.

08:54.236 --> 08:57.003
Eight-hour tours with all
the other broken toys watching

08:57.005 --> 08:59.205
video monitors at
housing projects.

08:59.207 --> 09:00.306
What's that about?

09:00.308 --> 09:03.309
It was the Chief
of Department's decision,

09:03.311 --> 09:04.611
not mine.

09:04.613 --> 09:05.812
Well, it's insult to injury.

09:05.814 --> 09:07.146
It is what it is.

09:08.183 --> 09:10.483
Do you want me to start
pulling strings for you?

09:10.485 --> 09:12.051
No, but this feels
like I'm getting extra lashes

09:12.053 --> 09:13.019
for appearance's sake.

09:13.021 --> 09:14.520
Well, you're not.

09:14.522 --> 09:16.589
And would
an average police officer

09:16.591 --> 09:18.791
feel free to come in here
and complain?

09:18.793 --> 09:20.627
No, but...
Well,

09:20.629 --> 09:22.795
then let's just stop right here,
okay?

09:22.797 --> 09:24.831
I-I don't want special
treatment, but I don't want

09:24.833 --> 09:28.201
to get turned into a political
football by Guerrero and Potter.

09:28.203 --> 09:30.637
You are my son,

09:30.639 --> 09:33.072
but you're also a member
of this department.

09:33.074 --> 09:36.743
And we have a whole system set
up to prove guilt or innocence.

09:36.745 --> 09:40.179
If we ask other people to trust
it, we have to do the same.

09:41.883 --> 09:43.850
I'm going to the movies.

09:43.852 --> 09:46.152
I'd love you to come with.

09:52.260 --> 09:54.360
My treat.

10:05.407 --> 10:06.773
(ding)

10:06.775 --> 10:08.041
Hey. What do we got?

10:08.043 --> 10:10.276
Call came in about an
hour and a half ago.

10:10.278 --> 10:12.345
A law student named
Diana Corning says

10:12.347 --> 10:14.681
she was raped
by Gerry Guerrero.

10:14.683 --> 10:16.149
Gerry Guerrero, the lawyer?

10:16.151 --> 10:17.617
Who the hell called it in?

10:17.619 --> 10:20.353
Patrol found her staggering
around outside the Yates Hotel.

10:20.355 --> 10:22.288
Guerrero's had a suite there
since his divorce.

10:22.290 --> 10:24.157
We know why she was
staggering around?

10:24.159 --> 10:25.892
Well, it'll take a while
for the tox screen results

10:25.894 --> 10:28.094
to come back, but signs
are consistent with roofies.

10:28.096 --> 10:29.896
She thinks Guerrero
put something in her drink.

10:29.898 --> 10:32.298
Rape kit?
Done. Soreness and bruising.

10:32.300 --> 10:35.935
Not definitive but not
your typical night of rough sex.

10:35.937 --> 10:38.805
We good to go?
Go ahead.

10:40.608 --> 10:45.812
I just wanted to be part
of the social justice movement.

10:45.814 --> 10:48.881
You were at the demonstration
earlier in the day?

10:48.883 --> 10:51.150
Yes. It was
so exciting.

10:51.152 --> 10:55.188
I mean, it was terrible,
how those cops reacted. (scoffs)

10:55.190 --> 11:00.093
And then you went back to
Mr. Guerrero's hotel after that?

11:00.095 --> 11:02.562
W... well, a lot of us went

11:02.564 --> 11:05.331
to discuss the next rally.

11:05.333 --> 11:08.134
And then I...

11:08.136 --> 11:10.269
I looked around and...

11:10.271 --> 11:12.438
and everyone else was gone.

11:12.440 --> 11:15.408
And the wall was moving.

11:16.478 --> 11:20.747
You think Mr. Guerrero
put something in your drink?

11:20.749 --> 11:22.682
Wh-When I came to,

11:22.684 --> 11:25.017
I was...

11:25.019 --> 11:28.354
I was naked on the bed,

11:28.356 --> 11:32.125
and he... he-he was...

11:32.127 --> 11:36.195
on top of me...

11:37.999 --> 11:39.732
...raping me.

11:39.734 --> 11:43.536
Did he say anything while
he was doing it or afterwards?

11:43.538 --> 11:45.872
DIANA:
No.

11:45.874 --> 11:49.475
Gerry's not
what he pretends to be.

11:49.477 --> 11:51.644
He says he's for the People,

11:51.646 --> 11:56.315
but he treated me
like a piece of meat.

12:07.662 --> 12:10.363
They look familiar?

12:11.466 --> 12:13.199
I don't know who this is.

12:13.201 --> 12:16.269
I don't know who any
of these people are.

12:16.271 --> 12:18.304
Straight from the hood, yo.

12:18.306 --> 12:20.673
Look, I don't care
where you were born.

12:20.675 --> 12:22.141
I don't care if you're
black or white.

12:22.143 --> 12:24.977
All I care about is the murder
of Anthony Reynolds.

12:24.979 --> 12:27.447
So now you're going after my
client's Fifth Amendment rights

12:27.449 --> 12:29.382
along with his
First Amendment rights?

12:29.384 --> 12:30.817
I'm not asking him
to incriminate himself.

12:30.819 --> 12:32.552
I'm asking him
to tell the truth.

12:32.554 --> 12:34.454
My record speaks for itself.

12:34.456 --> 12:36.255
That's cute.

12:36.257 --> 12:37.957
And if that's true,
then you're admitting

12:37.959 --> 12:39.358
that you're guilty of murder.

12:39.360 --> 12:41.327
And if it's not, then
you're just afraid

12:41.329 --> 12:43.896
that the truth
will wreck your image.

12:43.898 --> 12:45.498
Chuck, we're done here.

12:45.500 --> 12:46.833
(phone buzzing)
They've got absolutely no case.

12:46.835 --> 12:48.167
See, Mr. Peters
is being paid

12:48.169 --> 12:50.636
by the record company, so
let me give you the facts

12:50.638 --> 12:51.737
of life straight up, Chuck.

12:51.739 --> 12:53.673
Rap on, lawyer lady.
See, your song

12:53.675 --> 12:55.675
has details that only
the killer would've known,

12:55.677 --> 12:57.410
so if you didn't do it,

12:57.412 --> 12:59.645
then somebody told you
how it went down.

12:59.647 --> 13:02.348
That makes you a material
witness to a homicide.

13:02.350 --> 13:03.749
Yo, this is wack.

13:03.751 --> 13:05.651
I'm outta here.
If you cooperate,

13:05.653 --> 13:07.420
we can work out a deal on
the gun possession charge.

13:07.422 --> 13:09.288
If you don't,

13:09.290 --> 13:11.324
then I will have you subpoenaed

13:11.326 --> 13:12.959
and brought before
a grand jury.

13:12.961 --> 13:14.527
And if you don't answer
their questions,

13:14.529 --> 13:16.329
I will ask the judge
to hold you in contempt

13:16.331 --> 13:17.497
and send you to Rikers.

13:17.499 --> 13:19.999
For real?

13:20.001 --> 13:21.434
(phone buzzing)
Yo, Ron, can she do that?

13:21.436 --> 13:24.136
Sorry, Chuck,
I gotta take this.

13:24.138 --> 13:26.572
You should clear your calendar.

13:26.574 --> 13:28.474
We're going to find
out just how tough

13:28.476 --> 13:30.209
you really are.

13:30.211 --> 13:33.045
♪ ♪

13:33.481 --> 13:34.881
(chirping)

13:36.684 --> 13:38.684
GUERRERO:
What the hell is this?

13:38.686 --> 13:41.254
This is yours,
I believe, counselor,

13:41.256 --> 13:43.322
and this is a warrant
to search the premises.

13:43.324 --> 13:45.491
On what possible basis?

13:45.493 --> 13:46.893
We're treating this
as a crime scene.

13:46.895 --> 13:49.061
(laughs)
Can you check the bedroom, bathroom.

13:49.063 --> 13:52.665
Oh, this is a remarkable
piece of good fortune, Detective Reagan.

13:52.667 --> 13:54.133
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

13:54.135 --> 13:55.334
Ah, sure you don't.

13:55.336 --> 13:56.802
You just happen to raid my room

13:56.804 --> 13:59.005
right after I criticize
your family.

13:59.007 --> 14:02.642
Even by Reagan standards,
that's pretty flagrant payback.

14:02.644 --> 14:04.010
You keep telling yourself that.

14:04.012 --> 14:05.444
You know what,
your old man must be slipping,

14:05.446 --> 14:08.047
'cause he used to be
much more subtle.

14:08.049 --> 14:09.715
Whatever history there is
between you and my old man

14:09.717 --> 14:11.884
has nothing to do
with why we're here now.

14:11.886 --> 14:13.185
Oh, I know why
you're here.

14:13.187 --> 14:15.488
Because I dared
to tell the truth

14:15.490 --> 14:17.590
about how you people operate.

14:17.592 --> 14:19.191
Right.
BAEZ: Reagan.

14:19.193 --> 14:20.293
What do you got?

14:20.295 --> 14:22.795
Roofies, handcuffs,
and a riding crop.

14:22.797 --> 14:24.363
That's not all my stuff.

14:24.365 --> 14:26.966
Not all of it?
Just some of it, maybe?

14:26.968 --> 14:29.869
Okay, you know what,
I'm not saying a thing.

14:29.871 --> 14:31.237
I need to make a phone call.

14:31.239 --> 14:33.472
Any lawyer who
represents himself

14:33.474 --> 14:35.341
has got a fool
for a client.

14:35.343 --> 14:37.176
Couldn't agree with you more.
Hey...

14:37.178 --> 14:39.812
Gerry Guerrero,
you are under arrest, sir.

14:39.814 --> 14:41.147
Oh, come on.

14:41.149 --> 14:43.115
Somebody get him some clothes.

14:43.985 --> 14:46.285
(siren chirping)

14:48.456 --> 14:50.623
JAMIE:
Hey.

14:50.625 --> 14:52.959
Hey, Jamie,
wh-what are you doing here?

14:52.961 --> 14:54.493
I thought that you had
a VIPER detail.

14:54.495 --> 14:56.062
I stopped by to get
the study guide

14:56.064 --> 14:57.263
for the sergeant's exam.

14:57.265 --> 14:58.631
Figured I'd make this
time work for me.

14:58.633 --> 15:00.232
Where you going,
all dressed up?

15:00.234 --> 15:02.034
I just got...

15:02.036 --> 15:06.038
I just called by the prosecutor
on your case to talk to them.

15:06.040 --> 15:07.873
Jamie, uh,

15:07.875 --> 15:09.675
what do you want me to say?

15:09.677 --> 15:11.177
Uh, well, just say what you saw.

15:11.179 --> 15:12.511
What else would you do?

15:12.513 --> 15:15.181
Well, I don't think you want me
to do that.

15:15.183 --> 15:17.149
Why not?

15:17.151 --> 15:19.318
We've always been
on the same side,

15:19.320 --> 15:22.088
and I... will always
have your back,

15:22.090 --> 15:23.823
but what I saw
didn't look good for you.

15:23.825 --> 15:25.157
What do you mean?

15:25.159 --> 15:27.660
Eddie, I didn't do
anything wrong.

15:27.662 --> 15:29.328
Well, then try to understand...

15:29.330 --> 15:32.932
I-I got to look out for myself
as well.

15:32.934 --> 15:35.101
Yeah, well, do what you
have to do, I guess.

15:35.103 --> 15:36.469
I'm sorry.

15:36.471 --> 15:39.872
I'm late,
I'm late to get there and...

15:39.874 --> 15:43.309
I got to go, okay?

15:54.122 --> 15:56.322
Reverend Potter, sir.

16:02.296 --> 16:04.463
You've got five minutes.

16:04.465 --> 16:06.932
Quite a leak you've
sprung around here.

16:06.934 --> 16:09.335
How's that?

16:09.337 --> 16:11.103
All these stories
about Gerry's arrest.

16:11.105 --> 16:13.773
Gerry's framing, arrest.

16:13.775 --> 16:15.207
You had it right
the first time.

16:15.209 --> 16:17.677
And we released
the arrest report

16:17.679 --> 16:19.478
in response to media requests

16:19.480 --> 16:21.547
after your press conference,
Reverend.

16:21.549 --> 16:23.082
The handcuffs? The riding crop?

16:23.084 --> 16:25.584
Those were cheap shots
and you know it.

16:25.586 --> 16:27.787
They were all facts contained
in the arrest report.

16:27.789 --> 16:30.156
That being said,
I did not authorize

16:30.158 --> 16:31.724
the release of all those facts.

16:31.726 --> 16:34.193
That message will be passed down
the chain of command.

16:34.195 --> 16:35.795
Too little too late.

16:35.797 --> 16:37.830
And you accuse me
of cheap shots

16:37.832 --> 16:40.533
when he compared my family
to gangsters?

16:40.535 --> 16:42.201
That was Gerry's analogy.

16:42.203 --> 16:43.602
Yeah, well,
I must've missed the part

16:43.604 --> 16:45.504
where you walked it back.

16:45.506 --> 16:47.006
You wouldn't be putting out
all these salacious,

16:47.008 --> 16:48.541
irrelevant details

16:48.543 --> 16:50.476
if you had a real case.

16:50.478 --> 16:51.877
This woman's story
is made of cardboard.

16:51.879 --> 16:54.647
That's for a jury to decide,
not me.

16:54.649 --> 16:56.949
I saw how she was hanging
all over Gerry at the protest.

16:56.951 --> 16:58.984
Everyone did.

16:58.986 --> 17:00.352
And they're prepared
to testify.

17:00.354 --> 17:01.887
Oh, if your people
had such a good a view,

17:01.889 --> 17:03.556
why aren't any of them
cooperating

17:03.558 --> 17:05.023
with the investigators?

17:05.026 --> 17:06.325
I'll tell you what.

17:06.327 --> 17:07.827
You investigate this woman

17:07.829 --> 17:09.762
for the scam artist
she really is

17:09.763 --> 17:11.997
and we'll think about
making witnesses available

17:11.999 --> 17:13.499
who could help your son's case.

17:15.837 --> 17:18.069
A quid pro quo

17:18.071 --> 17:19.805
to corrupt an investigation?

17:19.807 --> 17:21.674
No, thanks.

17:21.675 --> 17:24.376
When this case is over,
we'll sue the NYPD

17:24.377 --> 17:26.645
for slander
and brutality.

17:26.646 --> 17:29.281
We'll have your sons' shields
and your own.

17:29.283 --> 17:31.484
And with a minute 30 to spare.

17:52.401 --> 17:54.201
I want to hand it
to you people.

17:54.203 --> 17:58.439
'Cause this is probably
the phoniest set-up

17:58.441 --> 18:00.341
since the invasion of Iraq.

18:00.343 --> 18:03.511
Really? So, somebody else put
the roofies in your bathroom?

18:03.513 --> 18:06.413
You think I look like someone who needs...
Gerry, please.

18:09.185 --> 18:11.185
No, they were not my drugs.

18:11.187 --> 18:12.887
I don't even know
how they got there.

18:12.889 --> 18:15.322
They were probably planted
by Miss Diana.

18:15.324 --> 18:16.791
DANNY:
Yeah.

18:16.793 --> 18:19.160
She roofied herself?
Come on.

18:19.162 --> 18:20.928
She's obviously part
of the setup.

18:20.930 --> 18:23.297
BAEZ:
The hospital did a rape kit.

18:23.299 --> 18:24.698
You know they're going
to find your DNA

18:24.700 --> 18:27.101
either in her or on her.

18:30.039 --> 18:31.639
All right...

18:31.641 --> 18:33.140
All right, cut to the chase.

18:33.142 --> 18:34.308
I had sex with her.

18:34.310 --> 18:35.543
DANNY:
Great. Now we're talking.

18:35.545 --> 18:38.012
But it was totally
consensual.

18:38.014 --> 18:39.680
So you were in a relationship?

18:39.682 --> 18:40.948
Not exactly.

18:40.950 --> 18:42.750
The first time
I laid eyes on her

18:42.752 --> 18:44.084
was at the rally yesterday.

18:44.086 --> 18:45.953
She told me she was getting
a law degree,

18:45.955 --> 18:47.788
she wanted to help out
with the cause.

18:47.790 --> 18:49.523
I'll bet you get that a lot.

18:49.525 --> 18:51.826
What, you think you guys are
the only ones who have groupies?

18:51.828 --> 18:54.628
Yes, she was unusually forward.

18:54.630 --> 18:57.131
Especially after she came back
to the hotel room with me.

18:57.133 --> 18:58.499
Hello.

18:58.501 --> 19:00.267
Where you gave her
a drink first?

19:00.269 --> 19:01.702
I gave her what she wanted--
vodka.

19:01.704 --> 19:03.671
I didn't put anything in it.

19:03.673 --> 19:05.372
Can you explain her bruises?

19:05.374 --> 19:07.441
She wanted it rough.

19:07.443 --> 19:09.443
Uh, some women do.

19:09.445 --> 19:11.579
I'm totally not into that.

19:12.615 --> 19:14.682
At any point,
did she lose consciousness

19:14.684 --> 19:16.483
or ask you to stop?

19:16.485 --> 19:19.019
No and no.

19:19.021 --> 19:21.522
In fact, the only thing
I'm probably guilty of

19:21.524 --> 19:23.057
is a lapse of judgment.

19:23.059 --> 19:27.361
For not being able to see
through the obvious entrapment.

19:27.363 --> 19:29.129
Who do you think
is setting you up?

19:29.131 --> 19:31.632
Oh, come on.
It's you guys.

19:31.634 --> 19:34.034
In fact, that bitch was
probably on the NYPD payroll

19:34.036 --> 19:36.003
to hope with the vendetta.

19:36.005 --> 19:38.439
And what vendetta
might that be?

19:38.441 --> 19:41.041
Come on, Detective Reagan,
don't play dumb.

19:41.043 --> 19:42.209
There's been a lot
of bad blood

19:42.211 --> 19:44.945
between your father
and me for years.

19:45.781 --> 19:48.382
And now you're carrying
his water.

19:51.654 --> 19:53.420
GUERRERO: It's really beautiful
of all you

19:53.422 --> 19:55.556
to show up
at my coming out party.

19:55.558 --> 19:59.193
I'd like to thank the judge
for granting bail,

19:59.195 --> 20:03.030
and seeing through
this blatant police ruse!

20:03.032 --> 20:05.032
(crowd cheers)

20:05.034 --> 20:07.368
It is no secret
that Gerry and I

20:07.370 --> 20:11.071
have been running afoul of the
Reagan mob for a long time.

20:11.073 --> 20:12.940
(crowd murmurs agreement)

20:12.942 --> 20:15.276
When Frank Reagan
had his minions

20:15.278 --> 20:18.746
violate the sanctity of a house
of worship in our community,

20:18.748 --> 20:20.014
we asked for accountability.

20:20.016 --> 20:21.982
(crowd murmurs agreement)

20:21.984 --> 20:24.184
When an unarmed citizen
went out a window

20:24.186 --> 20:26.487
with Danny Reagan
standing behind him,

20:26.489 --> 20:28.222
we asked for accountability.

20:28.224 --> 20:29.823
(crowd murmurs agreement)
Right?

20:29.825 --> 20:32.493
And just yesterday,
an innocent bystander

20:32.495 --> 20:35.496
was put in the hospital
by Officer Jamie Reagan.

20:35.498 --> 20:37.998
Again, we asked
for accountability.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.301
(cheers)

20:40.303 --> 20:41.802
And Commissioner Reagan
had his foot soldiers

20:41.804 --> 20:44.605
arrest Gerry
for daring to speak the truth.

20:44.607 --> 20:46.674
(jeering)

20:46.676 --> 20:49.276
But it's not going
to work, is it?!

20:49.278 --> 20:50.811
Hell no!
(angry shouts)

20:50.813 --> 20:52.112
Hell no!

20:52.114 --> 20:53.881
So what time is it, people?

20:53.883 --> 20:56.450
It's time for them to go.

20:56.452 --> 20:57.584
Commissioner Reagan must resign

20:57.586 --> 20:59.887
and take the rest of his
corrupt kin with him.

20:59.889 --> 21:04.058
CROWD (chanting):
Reagan must go! Reagan must go!

21:04.060 --> 21:05.559
Louder!
Reagan must go!

21:05.561 --> 21:06.961
Reagan must go!
Let him hear you!

21:06.963 --> 21:09.330
Reagan must go! Reagan must go!
Let him hear you!

21:09.332 --> 21:11.632
Across the country!
Reagan must go!

21:11.634 --> 21:13.133
Reagan must go!
Let him hear you!

21:13.135 --> 21:15.836
Reagan must go! Reagan must go!
One more time!

21:18.607 --> 21:21.041
(on video):
Hey! Hey! Yo, yo.

21:21.043 --> 21:22.609
(people shouting, clamoring)

21:22.611 --> 21:25.079
Yo, yo! Stop!
What are you doing, man?

21:32.188 --> 21:34.888
Okay, that's not what happened.

21:34.890 --> 21:37.291
You telling us to believe
you and not our lying eyes?

21:37.293 --> 21:38.692
It's just one angle.

21:38.694 --> 21:40.194
The camera isn't
showing you everything.

21:40.196 --> 21:41.428
Thank you, Mr. Hardin,

21:41.430 --> 21:43.430
but that question
was for your client.

21:43.432 --> 21:45.766
The clip doesn't show
what led up to the collision.

21:45.768 --> 21:49.203
He was about to crash
into a woman with a child.

21:49.205 --> 21:51.171
Who no one else happened to see?

21:51.173 --> 21:52.806
They were there.

21:52.808 --> 21:55.042
Have you interviewed
all the other witnesses?

21:55.044 --> 21:56.176
We interviewed your partner

21:56.178 --> 21:57.845
who does not concur
with your account.

21:57.847 --> 21:59.847
What? No, that's because...

21:59.849 --> 22:02.116
She's saying that because
her view was blocked.

22:02.118 --> 22:04.618
She also spoke to us
about an earlier incident

22:04.620 --> 22:06.820
where you overreacted
with excessive force

22:06.822 --> 22:09.123
because you were trying
to protect her.

22:09.125 --> 22:11.925
I'm sure that's not how she put it.
The incident

22:11.927 --> 22:13.560
is-is in our notes.

22:13.562 --> 22:15.229
She spoke about it candidly.

22:15.231 --> 22:17.197
Look...

22:17.199 --> 22:19.733
Officer Reagan came in,
over my objection,

22:19.735 --> 22:22.836
because he wanted to proffer
and clear up the record

22:22.838 --> 22:25.639
as soon as possible.
Then let's be clear.

22:25.641 --> 22:28.675
The process has been
working well for Officer Reagan

22:28.677 --> 22:30.778
and his family
for a long time.

22:30.780 --> 22:33.013
Hasn't it?
What are you getting at?

22:33.015 --> 22:35.749
Your brother has beaten numerous
excessive force complaints

22:35.751 --> 22:38.018
while your father's been
police commissioner.

22:38.020 --> 22:40.687
Maybe you think
you're invulnerable as well.

22:40.689 --> 22:43.524
I'm not looking for a whitewash;
all I want's a fair shake.

22:43.526 --> 22:44.725
Fair shake's
exactly what

22:44.727 --> 22:46.160

22:46.162 --> 22:48.228
This office operates
independently

22:48.230 --> 22:49.496

22:49.498 --> 22:51.198
Your sister may work here,

22:51.200 --> 22:53.667

is not the same as

22:53.669 --> 22:55.235
a "get out of
jail free" card.

The only shield I asked for
is the one on my chest.

I would turn on you that easily,

in the first place.

No. Though I know a lieutenant

She was only here a month.

just threw it in the town car

She was married twice

a marriage of convenience

29:55.803 --> 29:58.070

Was she getting paid?
I could think of worse reasons.

Nothing on where
she is now, though.

30:02.877 --> 30:04.410
Nothing on her social media?

No. She told Guerrero

30:05.613 --> 30:07.446
she was a committed
social activist,

That's so nice.

But I don't think
I have to talk to you.

charge me with?

30:47.488 --> 30:48.788
Oh, maybe we'll start

Oh, good luck proving it.

discrimination settlement

So...?

31:15.884 --> 31:18.384
So it's pretty damn obvious you
were helping set Guerrero up

elbowed out of the big money.

the groundwork for a shakedown?

Murtagh made to our office.

your father's hand in this.

38:39.906 --> 38:41.139

every single piece

38:57.624 --> 38:59.123

38:59.125 --> 39:00.492
He's off the
hook for now.

39:00.494 --> 39:01.960
His family pulled
some strings.

39:01.962 --> 39:04.729
I don't know what
you're talking about.

39:04.731 --> 39:07.866
A Detective Danny Reagan

showing the officer protecting

39:10.270 --> 39:11.703
a mother and a child
from the bike rider.

39:11.705 --> 39:13.304
I told you that
from the start.

39:13.306 --> 39:14.706
The rider's getting out of
the hospital later today,

39:14.708 --> 39:16.574

pressing charges.

40:03.790 --> 40:05.590
We got it cleared up
with the DA's office.

40:05.592 --> 40:07.592
No, it's-it's not that. I...

40:07.594 --> 40:10.128
I'm really sorry
about what I said.

40:10.130 --> 40:13.064
When you said maybe I should
get a partner I can trust?

40:13.066 --> 40:15.633
(sighs)
Hey.

40:15.635 --> 40:18.136
I already got a
partner I can trust.

40:18.138 --> 40:20.738
You want to keep things
how they are?

40:20.740 --> 40:21.940
I still got your back.

40:21.942 --> 40:23.274
POTTER:
What do we want?

40:23.276 --> 40:24.309
CROWD:
Justice.

40:24.311 --> 40:25.343
When do we want it?

40:25.345 --> 40:26.611
CROWD: Now!
Here we go again.

40:26.613 --> 40:28.012
POTTER: What do we want?
CROWD: Justice!

40:28.014 --> 40:29.180
POTTER:
When do we want it?

40:29.182 --> 40:30.548
CROWD: Now!
What do we want?

40:30.550 --> 40:31.916
Justice!
When do we want it?

40:31.918 --> 40:33.318
Now!

40:37.724 --> 40:39.791
Ah.
Thank you.

40:39.793 --> 40:42.527
Thanks.
You're welcome.

40:42.529 --> 40:45.330
What are you in the mood for?

40:45.332 --> 40:48.433
An apology from you.

40:48.435 --> 40:51.836
I don't think
that's on the menu.

40:51.838 --> 40:54.472
Maybe it's the special.

40:56.109 --> 40:58.209
How about I go first?

40:58.211 --> 41:00.678
Meaning, then I apologize?

41:00.680 --> 41:03.281
Yeah.

41:04.985 --> 41:10.054
Some of the details
of our investigation

41:10.056 --> 41:12.457
following Ms. Corning's
accusations against you

41:12.459 --> 41:15.460
were leaked to the
press by my department.

41:15.462 --> 41:18.963
I regret the action
and the consequences,

41:18.965 --> 41:22.000
and the people involved
have been corrected.

41:23.136 --> 41:25.169
Does corrected mean canned?

41:25.171 --> 41:27.405
No. It means corrected.

41:27.407 --> 41:29.007
And we have

41:29.009 --> 41:31.209
encouraged our friends
in the press

41:31.211 --> 41:34.045
to cover your accuser
and her motives

41:34.047 --> 41:38.583
as thoroughly as they did the
false accusations against you.

41:39.886 --> 41:41.853
That's your apology?

41:41.855 --> 41:44.589
It sounds like a press release.

41:44.591 --> 41:45.923
It's my apology.

41:45.925 --> 41:48.326
Sounds like something Garrett...
It's my apology

41:48.328 --> 41:51.696
to a guy who accused
both my sons of brutality,

41:51.698 --> 41:54.432
and who likened me
to a Mafia don.

41:54.434 --> 41:56.034
I'm a loudmouth.
That's what I do.

41:56.036 --> 41:57.301
You know that.

41:57.303 --> 41:58.970
You don't go after my family.

41:58.972 --> 42:00.104
They're cops.

42:00.106 --> 42:03.474
They're my family... first.

42:03.476 --> 42:06.544
So you saw fit to take
a fire hose to a lit match?

42:06.546 --> 42:07.945
Come on, Frank.

42:07.947 --> 42:12.417
If we're gonna eat,
we should order.

42:12.419 --> 42:14.986
You know, most guys
I'd think, "Gee,

42:14.988 --> 42:16.988
"he's got a thin skin
when it comes

42:16.990 --> 42:18.790
to matters surrounding
his family."

42:18.792 --> 42:20.458
I get that.

42:20.460 --> 42:22.293
But I don't think
that's what's going on here.

42:22.295 --> 42:23.928
I think

42:23.930 --> 42:27.131
that you move
your human traits around

42:27.133 --> 42:30.435
to what plays best
for each given situation.

42:30.437 --> 42:32.804
No, I can't tell you
what to think.

42:32.806 --> 42:35.406
You would have made
a good lawyer, you know that?

42:35.408 --> 42:38.409
I consider that an insult.

42:38.411 --> 42:39.644
So, where's my apology?

42:39.646 --> 42:42.447
Actually, I should be
apologizing to the members

42:42.449 --> 42:45.316
of the Columbo
and the Gambino family

42:45.318 --> 42:46.718
for comparing them to you.

42:46.720 --> 42:49.654
Are you ready to order,
Gentlemen?

42:49.656 --> 42:52.256
Yes. He'll take the crow.

42:52.258 --> 42:55.059
Humble pie for my friend.

42:56.529 --> 42:58.596
Would you like me to come back?

42:58.598 --> 43:01.899
No. Hold on.

43:05.505 --> 43:07.672
(sighs)

43:09.509 --> 43:12.643
The porterhouse for two?

43:13.811 --> 43:16.579
Done.
