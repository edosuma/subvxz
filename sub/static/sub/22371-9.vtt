10:14.572 --> 10:16.563
Yeah.

It's gotta be.

I wanted to make sure
I was able to say good-bye.

- No.
- I got bit.

12:22.158 --> 12:24.274
I was bringing someone back.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.322
His name's Siddiq.

12:29.123 --> 12:32.161
We saw him at that gas station, before...

12:33.795 --> 12:35.877
It wasn't the Saviors.

12:37.423 --> 12:40.040
It just happened.

12:49.394 --> 12:51.806
I got bit.

13:01.489 --> 13:03.651
Gavin: Megan's gonna kill you now.

13:08.621 --> 13:11.033
I said he's gonna kill you.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.370
And there's nothing I can do to stop that.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.962
Hey.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.289
You hear me?

13:21.384 --> 13:24.547
I ferried my people to freedom.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.345
What befalls me now matters not.

13:27.432 --> 13:30.220
No. It matters, idiot.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.178
I liked you, Ezekiel.

13:34.272 --> 13:36.354
You got it.

13:36.441 --> 13:38.773
You got that you couldn't do better

13:38.860 --> 13:40.191
than you had it.

13:40.278 --> 13:43.145
You accepted things for what they were,

13:43.239 --> 13:45.981
and you didn't get any big ideas
in your head.

13:49.662 --> 13:53.371
And then Rick went
and planted one right in there.

13:55.752 --> 13:57.834
And here we are.

13:59.088 --> 14:00.954
Shit's getting shittier.

14:01.049 --> 14:02.710
And you're gonna die.

14:02.800 --> 14:05.383
I made a choice I could live with.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.964
Now it's your turn to do the same.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.068
(whispering) Henry!

14:41.005 --> 14:42.621
Hey.

14:44.342 --> 14:47.130
(whispering) They don't have
enough people to guard all the walls.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.756
No, but they do have people.

14:48.846 --> 14:51.178
- And they have Ezekiel.
- I saw him.

14:51.265 --> 14:53.427
They got him on the other side
of this place.

14:54.852 --> 14:57.014
We can take them. One by one.

14:57.105 --> 14:58.846
No, if we hit one of them,

14:58.940 --> 15:00.681
that could call them all.

15:00.775 --> 15:02.607
It's better just to avoid them
until we can't.

15:02.693 --> 15:04.183
Hem')!-

15:04.278 --> 15:06.565
He's here, too.

15:06.656 --> 15:08.272
Where?

15:08.366 --> 15:09.948
Did you see him?
Do they have him?

15:10.034 --> 15:12.571
Yeah, I saw him run this way,
and then he was gone.

15:13.287 --> 15:14.448
But he'll hide.

15:14.539 --> 15:16.405
He won't take them on face-to-face.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.624
We have to do this now.

15:19.710 --> 15:21.621
So if we have to take them, we take them.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.634
(grunts)

15:29.720 --> 15:31.131
(muffled explosions in distance)

15:37.186 --> 15:38.802
Is that better?

15:38.896 --> 15:41.433
Yeah.

15:41.524 --> 15:43.265
Thanks.

15:45.611 --> 15:48.023
Siddiq: I, um, I got these.

15:50.032 --> 15:51.648
They're over-the-counter,

15:51.742 --> 15:54.200
non-steroidal anti-inflammatories.

15:56.247 --> 15:57.453
They'll, um--

15:57.540 --> 16:00.828
They'll help a little with the fever.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.203
It did for my morn and dad.

16:06.132 --> 16:08.294
(voice breaking)
Please take them.

16:09.510 --> 16:11.501
Your son...

16:11.596 --> 16:13.257
he should have them.

16:22.690 --> 16:24.431
You're a doctor?

16:24.525 --> 16:27.267
I was a resident...

16:27.361 --> 16:29.227
before.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.404
Yeah.

16:32.950 --> 16:35.362
Your name is Siddiq?

16:36.162 --> 16:37.243
Yes.

16:39.248 --> 16:41.785
Did you know he was a doctor?

16:41.876 --> 16:44.208
Is that why you brought him back?

16:44.295 --> 16:46.536
He wasn't gonna make it alone.

16:47.965 --> 16:49.956
He needed us.

16:51.219 --> 16:53.381
That's why.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.716
He was the one at the gas station.

17:04.315 --> 17:06.056
(explosion, rocks clatter)

17:06.150 --> 17:08.482
(coughing)

17:08.569 --> 17:10.151
Shh!

17:10.238 --> 17:11.898
Michonne: Water. Give him water.

17:11.989 --> 17:13.900
(coughing continues)

17:13.991 --> 17:15.777
Rick: Easy. You got it?

17:17.828 --> 17:19.364
Slowly, slowly.

17:19.454 --> 17:22.242
(grunting)

17:28.172 --> 17:30.129
(muffled explosions continue)

17:30.216 --> 17:32.674
Make it stop!

17:35.846 --> 17:37.632
Make them stop.

17:38.849 --> 17:40.760
(muffled explosions continue)

17:40.851 --> 17:43.092
- I can't.
- You can.

17:43.187 --> 17:44.769
You're one of them.

17:44.855 --> 17:46.220
They'll listen to you.

17:46.315 --> 17:48.306
(breathing heavily)

17:50.236 --> 17:52.273
Please.

17:53.573 --> 17:56.315
(muffled explosions continue)

17:56.409 --> 17:58.400
Please.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.870
(muffled explosions continue)

18:16.762 --> 18:18.628
You said that Hilltop's safe, right?

18:21.058 --> 18:22.594
Yeah.

18:22.685 --> 18:23.971
We need to get everybody there.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.891
We can get Carl there.

18:27.982 --> 18:30.974
They think all of you
got away in the woods.

18:31.068 --> 18:34.151
They're out there, looking.

18:34.238 --> 18:37.321
They saw us go west,
so we won't go west.

18:37.408 --> 18:40.366
Your best chance is to stay here

18:40.453 --> 18:41.989
until they're gone.

18:42.079 --> 18:43.490
Daryl: No.

18:43.581 --> 18:46.369
- They find us here, we're dead.
- They're almost done.

18:47.710 --> 18:49.576
They gotta be.

18:50.755 --> 18:53.463
It wasn't about destroying the place.

18:53.549 --> 18:56.166
They don't have the ammo for that.

18:58.054 --> 18:59.795
After they let up,

18:59.889 --> 19:01.675
after they're gone,

19:01.766 --> 19:03.973
that's when we go.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.897
(muffled explosions continue)

19:17.114 --> 19:18.946
Okay-

19:19.909 --> 19:21.741
We wait.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.709
You sure going to Hilltop's
the best plan?

19:35.800 --> 19:38.918
You got a better one?

19:40.012 --> 19:42.720
All of you in one place, together...

19:42.807 --> 19:44.593
Daryl:
All of us together...

19:47.103 --> 19:48.889
we'll be their worst damn nightmare.

19:54.568 --> 19:56.559
(suspenseful music plays)

20:02.284 --> 20:04.275
(fire crackling)

20:23.013 --> 20:26.256
(whispering) If we don't go through 'em,
we gotta go through the courtyard.

20:27.518 --> 20:28.929
Exposed.

20:31.647 --> 20:33.229
This is it.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.102
This is it.

21:04.221 --> 21:06.212
You want me to just do it?

21:06.307 --> 21:07.843
No.

21:08.851 --> 21:10.091
(door opens)

21:23.240 --> 21:25.277
No. No.

21:25.367 --> 21:26.732
Uhuds)

21:32.833 --> 21:35.541
Got all of 'em.

21:35.628 --> 21:37.414
They could've found Henry.

21:37.505 --> 21:39.963
I know.

21:40.049 --> 21:42.711
I'm not worried about them.

21:47.723 --> 21:49.259
Come on, boys.

21:49.350 --> 21:50.840
Get the damn gum off your shoes.

21:50.935 --> 21:52.300
Let's

21:59.068 --> 22:01.105
Is it gonna go bad, Ezekiel?

22:02.571 --> 22:05.404
Is this going to turn
into something else?

22:05.491 --> 22:07.778
Ezekiel:
You are the author of this night, Gavin.

22:09.328 --> 22:12.241
Its close shall be fashioned
by your start.

22:23.551 --> 22:25.087
You left.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.292
(muffled explosions in distance)

22:26.387 --> 22:28.594
You were supposed to be resting.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.923
I'm not tired.

22:32.017 --> 22:33.223
Yeah.

22:33.310 --> 22:35.347
You look great.

22:35.437 --> 22:36.973
(chuckles softly)

22:38.983 --> 22:42.066
(sighs) It's gotta stop, Michonne.

22:44.071 --> 22:46.483
It's not supposed to be like this.

22:49.618 --> 22:52.076
I know it can be better.

23:05.259 --> 23:08.092
Scott:
Sounds like they're letting up.

23:09.471 --> 23:12.463
Looks like you were right.

23:12.558 --> 23:15.141
They're leaving.

23:15.227 --> 23:17.343
Daryl: Maybe.

23:28.324 --> 23:30.565
(sighs)
Want me to go take a look?

23:30.659 --> 23:32.400
(Judith cooing)

23:32.494 --> 23:34.861
(whispering) Hey. Hey-

23:57.770 --> 23:59.306
Carol: There.

24:00.189 --> 24:02.180
(indistinct conversations)

24:08.822 --> 24:11.314
Man: Sure as shit gonna beat
living in that chemical dump.

24:11.408 --> 24:15.117
Man #2: Hell, you want that room,
you're gonna have to fight me for it...

24:15.204 --> 24:16.786
(whispering) Leave it.

24:26.924 --> 24:28.710
Leave it.

24:34.056 --> 24:35.512
H9)!-

24:39.687 --> 24:41.348
(silenced gunshot)

24:48.320 --> 24:49.902
Let's go.

25:07.297 --> 25:09.755
Leave some room for Ezekiel.

25:11.010 --> 25:13.172
Get him a pillow or something.

25:15.055 --> 25:16.295
It's gonna be his last ride.

25:16.390 --> 25:18.301
Let's at least try to make him
comfortable.

25:25.899 --> 25:27.765
You try, and you try, and you try,

25:27.860 --> 25:29.726
and you hope, and you hope,
and you hope.

25:29.820 --> 25:34.656
Just wantin' things
to finally just settle.

25:34.742 --> 25:37.655
Achieve some goddamn,
hard-fought equilibrium.

25:37.745 --> 25:39.577
But, no.

25:40.664 --> 25:42.746
It always comes down to this.

25:44.501 --> 25:48.495
It always has to get dark and ugly...

25:50.299 --> 25:51.881
and inhuman.

25:55.721 --> 25:57.587
You know I don't like this, right?

25:57.681 --> 25:59.137
It is not too late

25:59.224 --> 26:02.262
to walk back from something decided.

26:02.352 --> 26:04.810
(scoffs lightly)

26:04.897 --> 26:06.103
You did,

26:06.190 --> 26:08.306
and look where it got you.

26:10.235 --> 26:12.272
- (walkie-talkie clicks)
- Duke. Paulie. Where you at?

26:12.362 --> 26:13.693
(Clicks)

26:19.411 --> 26:23.075
Stop pickin' dingles,
grab your walkie, and respond!

26:23.165 --> 26:24.701
(Clicks)

26:27.252 --> 26:29.789
(suspenseful music plays)

26:29.880 --> 26:30.995
(clicks, static hisses)

26:31.090 --> 26:33.457
- Gomez?
- (clicks)

26:37.846 --> 26:39.257
- (clicks, static hisses)
- Gomez!

26:39.348 --> 26:40.838
(Clicks)

26:46.313 --> 26:50.557
It is not too late to walk back
from something decided.

26:50.651 --> 26:53.188
(gunfire in distance)

26:53.278 --> 26:56.816
Shit. There it is.
Get him inside. Now!

27:20.806 --> 27:22.797
(insects chirping)

27:26.603 --> 27:28.594
(breathing heavily)

27:37.364 --> 27:40.072
(mid-tempo music plays)

27:40.159 --> 27:42.116
(birds chirping)

27:42.202 --> 27:43.613
I calibrate this cooker properly,

27:43.704 --> 27:46.036
we'll be lousy with baked apples
ad infinitum.

27:48.292 --> 27:49.908
It would be my honor

27:50.002 --> 27:52.039
if you considered to be
the sous to my chef.

27:52.129 --> 27:55.087
Or I could be said sous,
and you shall surely chef.

27:56.091 --> 27:58.799
'Til then, this Golden Delicious
has your name on it.

27:58.886 --> 28:01.594
Thanks,Eugene.

28:02.181 --> 28:03.592
Thanks.

28:35.047 --> 28:37.163
The Saviors are gone.

28:37.257 --> 28:38.622
We can get everyone to Hilltop.

28:38.717 --> 28:40.378
We can get Carl there.

28:40.469 --> 28:43.086
Carl? No.

28:44.681 --> 28:45.967
Daryl can get one of the cars.

28:46.058 --> 28:47.344
Carl won't make--

28:49.228 --> 28:50.559
He can't leave here.

28:50.646 --> 28:52.557
- I have to stay with him.
- Rick.

28:52.648 --> 28:54.685
He can't.

28:54.775 --> 28:57.016
I have to stay.

29:01.031 --> 29:02.863
We'll both stay.

29:05.869 --> 29:07.985
Will you...

29:08.080 --> 29:09.662
(sighs)

29:09.748 --> 29:11.659
Will you take Judith?

29:13.126 --> 29:14.833
She needs to be there.

29:16.922 --> 29:18.253
If she...

29:18.340 --> 29:20.672
(voice breaking) If...

29:20.759 --> 29:21.794
happens...

29:21.885 --> 29:23.375
Daryl: I'll take her.

29:24.179 --> 29:26.261
I'll get her there. I'll keep her safe.

29:27.891 --> 29:29.347
I got this.

29:30.811 --> 29:32.848
Carl: Let me say good-bye.

29:51.832 --> 29:53.948
(breathes sharply)

29:54.042 --> 29:55.953
You be good, okay?

29:57.087 --> 29:58.953
For Michonne.

29:59.047 --> 30:01.288
For Dad.

30:04.720 --> 30:07.257
You gotta honor him.

30:07.347 --> 30:09.054
Listen when he tells you stuff.

30:10.767 --> 30:13.134
You don't have to always.

30:14.813 --> 30:18.056
Sometimes, kids got to show
their parents the way.

30:30.454 --> 30:32.786
(sighs)

30:32.873 --> 30:34.705
(breathing heavily)

30:36.209 --> 30:38.621
This was Dad's before it was mine.

30:40.714 --> 30:42.705
Now it's yours.

30:42.799 --> 30:43.880
(sniffles)

30:45.635 --> 30:48.218
I don't know... Just--

30:48.305 --> 30:50.637
Just having it and...

30:50.724 --> 30:52.681
it always kept Dad with me.

30:56.063 --> 30:58.225
It made me feel as strong as him.

31:03.320 --> 31:05.231
It helped me.

31:07.282 --> 31:09.523
Maybe it'll help you, too.

31:17.626 --> 31:19.788
Before Mom died...

31:23.632 --> 31:27.125
she told me that I was
gonna beat this world.

31:30.472 --> 31:31.962
I didn't.

31:35.519 --> 31:36.634
But you will.

31:36.728 --> 31:39.015
(Judith whines softly)

31:39.106 --> 31:41.097
I know you will.

31:42.150 --> 31:43.561
(crying)

31:45.362 --> 31:46.818
Daryl: Here we go.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.487
(crying continues)

31:55.664 --> 31:57.780
These people.

31:57.874 --> 31:59.956
You saved them all.

32:01.670 --> 32:03.502
That's all you, man.

32:26.778 --> 32:30.396
You were helping me honor my mom...

32:30.490 --> 32:32.356
Carl: Not just yours.

32:32.451 --> 32:35.068
Mine, too.

32:37.456 --> 32:39.663
You brought me here.

32:39.749 --> 32:42.491
You gave me a chance.

32:44.963 --> 32:47.204
I know I can never repay you...

32:49.301 --> 32:51.338
but I can honor you

32:51.428 --> 32:54.011
by showing your people,

32:54.097 --> 32:58.182
your f-friends, your-- your family

32:58.268 --> 33:00.635
that what you did

33:00.729 --> 33:02.811
wasn't for nothing.

33:04.733 --> 33:06.144
That it mattered.

33:07.444 --> 33:09.685
That it-- That it meant something.

33:12.449 --> 33:14.440
Because it did.

33:16.703 --> 33:18.614
So that's what I'm gonna do.

33:21.750 --> 33:25.584
I'm gonna honor you, Carl.

33:30.008 --> 33:32.170
(breathing deeply)

33:33.720 --> 33:35.302
Congratulations.

33:36.890 --> 33:38.472
You're stuck with us.

34:17.639 --> 34:19.380
Gavin: Okay.

34:19.474 --> 34:21.886
There can't be a lot of 'em
'cause there aren't a lot left.

34:21.976 --> 34:24.184
We got room for us and controlled access.

34:24.271 --> 34:26.137
Force projected on the doors, now!

34:26.231 --> 34:27.516
(indistinct shouting)

34:27.607 --> 34:30.770
We end this, whatever the hell it is.

34:32.152 --> 34:35.315
I gotta settle this shit
under the penalty of that goddamn bat.

34:36.741 --> 34:38.322
You don't.

34:40.495 --> 34:42.532
Shut up about that, okay?

34:42.621 --> 34:43.657
This is it!

34:43.748 --> 34:45.534
It is too late.

34:45.625 --> 34:48.161
I'm the "author," you're the dead man,

34:48.253 --> 34:50.164
and that's how it's gonna be.

34:51.755 --> 34:53.996
You think I can be someone else?

34:54.092 --> 34:56.754
This is who I am.

34:56.844 --> 35:00.679
I live, you die-- this is what this is!

35:00.765 --> 35:03.348
The petty compromises
I made to avoid conflict

35:03.435 --> 35:06.848
were always done in the name
of saving my people's lives.

35:08.440 --> 35:11.102
Now I realize...

35:11.192 --> 35:14.059
I was saving yours.

35:14.154 --> 35:16.020
No more.

35:44.976 --> 35:48.059
Gavin:
Give up, or he's dead.

36:42.742 --> 36:44.324
(Morgan screams)

36:46.788 --> 36:48.119
(screaming)

36:56.381 --> 36:58.338
(screaming)

37:24.117 --> 37:26.529
Jesus.

37:41.134 --> 37:44.297
Morgan, we should take our leave.

37:44.387 --> 37:48.096
We don't need to go.
All of them are dead.

38:22.133 --> 38:23.840
You Okay?

38:25.011 --> 38:27.594
I don't want you to be sad after this.

38:29.224 --> 38:31.386
- Carl...
- Or angry.

38:34.479 --> 38:36.686
You're gonna have to be strong.

38:37.899 --> 38:40.231
For my dad.

38:40.318 --> 38:42.400
For Judith.

38:44.489 --> 38:47.572
For yourself.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.116
I will.

39:00.338 --> 39:02.420
Don't carry this.

39:03.508 --> 39:05.590
Not this part.

39:10.974 --> 39:13.306
You're my best friend, Michonne.

39:14.936 --> 39:16.927
(crying)

39:19.566 --> 39:21.477
You're mine, too.

39:23.736 --> 39:25.568
You're mine.

39:40.003 --> 39:41.869
I need your help.

39:41.963 --> 39:43.874
With what?

39:45.466 --> 39:47.377
Getting him out of here.

39:55.184 --> 39:57.596
(grunting)

39:57.687 --> 39:59.678
(gasping)

40:22.879 --> 40:24.870
(Carl groaning softly)

40:31.095 --> 40:32.506
We need to stop.

40:34.974 --> 40:37.090
The house up ahead.
We can make it.

40:37.185 --> 40:38.346
It's okay.

40:38.436 --> 40:39.926
It's okay. Just put me down here.

40:40.021 --> 40:41.102
It's okay.

40:41.189 --> 40:43.100
- No. We'll make it.
- Please.

40:46.819 --> 40:48.275
There.

40:59.958 --> 41:01.949
(breathing quickly)

41:44.877 --> 41:46.868
(Carl breathing heavily)

42:07.608 --> 42:09.690
Thanks... for--

42:11.446 --> 42:14.359
for getting me here.

42:15.283 --> 42:17.194
I'm-- I'm sorry.

42:17.285 --> 42:18.616
L-| just...

42:18.703 --> 42:20.489
I didn't-- I didn't want you out there.

42:20.580 --> 42:21.741
<i>_ l_l__
- No.</i>

42:21.831 --> 42:24.243
No... for getting me here.

42:26.002 --> 42:29.245
For-- For making it

42:29.338 --> 42:31.750
so I could be who--

42:34.093 --> 42:36.255
who I wound up.

42:36.345 --> 42:38.336
(shallow breathing)

42:52.653 --> 42:54.940
Back at the prison...

42:55.031 --> 42:57.022
when we got attacked...

43:00.995 --> 43:02.906
there was a kid...

43:04.457 --> 43:06.994
a little older than me.

43:07.085 --> 43:09.326
He had a gun.

43:12.590 --> 43:15.002
He was...

43:15.093 --> 43:16.879
He was starting to put it down...

43:18.638 --> 43:21.551
and I-l 3..

43:21.641 --> 43:23.678
I shot him.

43:27.647 --> 43:29.479
He was-- He was giving it up,

43:29.565 --> 43:31.806
and I... I just...

43:34.070 --> 43:35.981
I shot him.

43:39.408 --> 43:41.695
I think about him.

43:41.786 --> 43:43.777
What I did t0 him

43:43.871 --> 43:46.533
and how...

43:46.624 --> 43:48.865
how easy it was

43:48.960 --> 43:52.544
to just... kill him.

43:56.175 --> 43:57.665
You're sick!

44:00.138 --> 44:03.597
Only a sick man would do it like this.

44:05.268 --> 44:07.384
You think I wanted this?

44:09.021 --> 44:11.433
There wasn't a lot on the menu.

44:11.524 --> 44:14.141
I ran a good crew.

44:14.235 --> 44:15.817
I kept my word.

44:15.903 --> 44:18.270
You ask Ezekiel-- I kept my word!

44:19.407 --> 44:20.989
(groans)

44:23.119 --> 44:25.360
You-- You could--

44:25.454 --> 44:28.196
You could go back to the Hilltop.
It's still standing.

44:28.291 --> 44:30.498
They're keeping them going.

44:30.585 --> 44:32.075
Just turn around.

44:38.593 --> 44:41.335
You think you can beat Negan?

44:43.055 --> 44:44.295
You can't.

44:46.809 --> 44:48.800
We can go back to how it was.

44:48.895 --> 44:50.886
We can go back-- (gasps)

44:52.648 --> 44:54.764
No.

44:56.903 --> 45:00.316
Carl, no.

45:01.574 --> 45:03.531
No.

45:07.955 --> 45:09.866
What happened...

45:11.167 --> 45:13.249
what you'd lost...

45:13.336 --> 45:15.373
(crying)

45:15.463 --> 45:18.501
All those things you had to...

45:18.591 --> 45:19.797
(sniffles)

45:19.884 --> 45:21.124
All those thing you had to do...

45:21.219 --> 45:23.381
You-- You-- You-- You were just--

45:23.471 --> 45:25.508
You were just a boy.

45:25.598 --> 45:28.215
And you saw it.

45:28.309 --> 45:30.220
What it did.

45:31.604 --> 45:36.644
How-- How easy it got.

45:38.027 --> 45:41.270
You just killed all those men
because of the kid?!

45:49.247 --> 45:52.080
Killing me won't make any of it go away.

45:54.377 --> 45:57.665
You'll still wake up
to the same shit tomorrow.

46:02.009 --> 46:03.170
Get up.

46:03.261 --> 46:04.501
- UP'

46:05.596 --> 46:08.054
(panting)

46:09.141 --> 46:10.631
<i>Carl: That's why you changed...</i>

46:13.271 --> 46:15.729
why you brought those people
from Woodbury in...

46:17.275 --> 46:20.518
You brought them in,
and we all lived together.

46:22.905 --> 46:24.896
We were enemies.

46:27.410 --> 46:30.152
You put away your gun.

46:30.246 --> 46:34.865
You did it so I could change,

46:34.959 --> 46:40.545
so I could be who I am now.

46:44.844 --> 46:46.755
What you did then...

46:46.846 --> 46:51.090
How you-- How you stopped fighting...

46:52.435 --> 46:54.346
it was right.

46:58.607 --> 47:00.268
It still is.

47:03.696 --> 47:06.438
It can be like that again.

47:06.532 --> 47:09.194
You can still be like that again.

47:14.206 --> 47:15.947
Ezekiel: Morgan.

47:16.792 --> 47:19.204
Morgan, cease this.

47:19.295 --> 47:21.878
Relent.

47:21.964 --> 47:24.456
Ending him is the coward's way.

47:26.635 --> 47:28.342
We've won.

47:29.430 --> 47:31.171
We don't have to kill him.

47:32.933 --> 47:35.550
He will see what he has wrought,

47:35.644 --> 47:37.726
and all of it will be his to live with.

47:43.444 --> 47:46.232
Rick: I can't be who I was.

47:46.322 --> 47:48.154
It's different now.

47:48.240 --> 47:50.151
Carl: You can't kill all of 'em, Dad.

47:51.035 --> 47:53.117
There's gotta be something after.

47:55.247 --> 47:58.660
For you... and for them.

48:03.005 --> 48:05.087
There's gotta be something after.

48:05.674 --> 48:08.086
Morgan, stop it.

48:10.429 --> 48:13.262
You don't want to do this.
You don't have to.

48:15.184 --> 48:17.300
You told me
we can be better than them.

48:17.395 --> 48:19.261
You said that to me.

48:22.900 --> 48:26.359
You don't want to do this.
I know it. I can see it.

48:29.323 --> 48:30.984
(crying) <i>I</i> have--

48:34.120 --> 48:35.906
I have to.

48:41.460 --> 48:43.497
I have to.

49:04.692 --> 49:06.353
(exhales sharply)

49:20.583 --> 49:22.915
Carl: I know...

49:23.002 --> 49:25.084
you can't see it yet...

49:26.881 --> 49:28.872
how it could be.

49:32.094 --> 49:33.835
But I have...

49:36.182 --> 49:38.765
You have a beard.

49:40.853 --> 49:43.015
It's-- It's bigger...

49:43.105 --> 49:45.187
and grayer...

49:46.358 --> 49:49.020
Michonne's happy»-

49:49.111 --> 49:51.773
Judith is older,

49:51.864 --> 49:55.448
and she's listening to the songs
that I used to before...

49:58.162 --> 49:59.652
Alexandria's bigger.

49:59.747 --> 50:01.738
There's...

50:01.832 --> 50:05.075
There's new houses...

50:05.169 --> 50:06.830
crops...

50:09.340 --> 50:11.081
and people working.

50:13.719 --> 50:15.460
Everybody living...

50:17.223 --> 50:19.339
helping everybody else live.

50:22.811 --> 50:25.473
If you can still be who you were...

50:27.191 --> 50:29.102
that's how it could be.

50:33.197 --> 50:34.653
It could.

50:38.744 --> 50:40.826
Carl.

50:40.913 --> 50:43.245
It was all for you.

50:44.833 --> 50:47.200
Right from the start.

50:50.339 --> 50:53.331
Back in Atlanta,

50:53.425 --> 50:56.508
the farm...

50:56.595 --> 50:59.132
everything I did, it was for you.

51:01.809 --> 51:04.722
Then, at the prison,
it was for you and Judith.

51:06.355 --> 51:09.143
It still is. It's gonna be.

51:09.233 --> 51:13.272
And nothing--
nothing is gonna change that.

51:16.115 --> 51:18.197
I want this for you, Dad.

51:25.040 --> 51:28.158
I'm gonna make it real, Carl.

51:28.252 --> 51:29.708
I promise.

51:29.795 --> 51:31.877
I'm gonna make it real.

51:54.111 --> 51:55.818
Henry.

51:57.072 --> 51:58.904
It's okay.

52:00.284 --> 52:02.366
It's all right.

52:02.453 --> 52:05.536
Don't look at him. You look at me.

52:06.707 --> 52:08.994
I had to.

52:09.084 --> 52:11.746
You were supposed to stay
at the cottage.

52:11.837 --> 52:13.327
This wasn't what
you were supposed to do.

52:13.422 --> 52:15.504
- This wasn't for you.
- Ezekiel: Carol.

52:18.260 --> 52:19.967
(sighs)

52:24.850 --> 52:26.591
Henry.

52:28.562 --> 52:30.473
All will be resolved.

52:36.403 --> 52:38.610
All will be resolved.

52:42.660 --> 52:45.743
Carl... I'm sorry.

52:48.957 --> 52:52.370
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.

52:54.963 --> 52:58.172
A father's job is to protect his son.

53:00.594 --> 53:01.584
Carl: Love.

53:04.973 --> 53:07.385
It's just to love.

53:08.519 --> 53:10.510
(breathing shallowly)

53:12.981 --> 53:14.972
(ragged breathing)

53:29.957 --> 53:31.664
No. No.

53:31.750 --> 53:33.161
Michonne: Carl...

53:33.252 --> 53:35.789
It-- It-- It... it should be--

53:35.879 --> 53:37.665
I know. I know.

53:37.756 --> 53:40.418
Somebody you love.

53:40.509 --> 53:42.625
When you can't do it yourself.

53:45.055 --> 53:47.217
But I still can.

53:51.854 --> 53:54.312
(voice breaking)
I grew up.

53:58.110 --> 54:00.101
I have to do this.

54:01.697 --> 54:03.233
Me.

54:14.126 --> 54:16.208
I love you.

54:16.295 --> 54:19.708
(Crying)
I love you, too.

54:31.685 --> 54:34.017
(voice breaking)
I love you, Dad.

54:40.235 --> 54:43.773
(crying)
I love you, Carl.

54:43.864 --> 54:45.525
I love you so much.

54:45.616 --> 54:47.573
(sobbing)

54:53.874 --> 54:55.990
(whispering)
I'll make it real.

54:57.628 --> 54:59.039
I will.

55:00.005 --> 55:01.541
I will.

55:16.063 --> 55:17.645
(silenced gunshot)

55:37.709 --> 55:39.700
(birds chirping)

55:41.004 --> 55:42.244
Good morning.

55:44.174 --> 55:46.541
Well, good morning to you, darlin'.

55:51.139 --> 55:53.130
(breathing heavily)

56:10.993 --> 56:12.984
(theme music playing)
