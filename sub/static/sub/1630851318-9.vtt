Dr. Park, this is Joe.

01:19.980 --> 01:22.015
He was helping his son, Cody,
into his wheelchair
when they had a spill.

01:22.150 --> 01:24.418
I'm too big for Dad.

(CHUCKLES)
No, you're not, buddy.

01:25.819 --> 01:27.355
Cody has Kabuki Syndrome.

You got banged up,
too, huh?

01:29.790 --> 01:31.525
I-I'm okay.
Just help Dad.

You know about Kabuki?

Genetic disorder characterized
by low muscle tone,

Ah, it looks worse

You're not in pain?

01:46.540 --> 01:47.541
Is that a bad thing?

01:49.076 --> 01:50.511
Might be a sign
of nerve damage.

I was 16 when I first saw
the Dunn Sisters live,

02:34.054 --> 02:38.292
and I saw your sister's tour
last year at the Rose Bowl.

02:38.426 --> 02:39.627
Then you've seen her
more than I have.

02:40.894 --> 02:42.896
She's made it even without
my accompaniment.

Hey.

Your bloodwork confirms
good compatibility

Oh. There's a thrill
in her left carotid.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.181
Could be
arterial obstruction.

03:01.315 --> 03:03.984
Without an
adequate blood supply
to the donor trachea,

03:04.117 --> 03:04.985
we can't do the surgery.

It's a concern,
but not sure it's a problem.

04:24.197 --> 04:25.699
You've had them before,
though, right?

04:25.833 --> 04:28.669
Yep, when I was a baby
and they fixed my heart.

04:29.803 --> 04:31.772
How many is
my dad gonna need?

04:32.840 --> 04:35.042
A few more than six.

04:46.354 --> 04:47.287
He should be out
in about two hours.

04:49.490 --> 04:55.262
He was a high school principal
in charge of 844 kids.

04:55.396 --> 04:57.264
Mm, very cool.

04:57.398 --> 04:59.900
But he had to quit
to look after me.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.705
Will he still be able
to lift me?

05:04.838 --> 05:07.575
Once his arm's all better?
Absolutely.

05:07.708 --> 05:11.144
You two will be out there

before you know it.

05:26.627 --> 05:28.462
Muy bien,
but I'm asking

05:28.596 --> 05:29.763
because she's sleeping
on my couch.

05:33.501 --> 05:35.503
Nelly's internal carotids
look good.

05:35.636 --> 05:38.939
Hmm, yes. They do look
better than they felt.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.474
Check the external
carotids.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.244
So you're not
getting married?

05:45.979 --> 05:47.781
Yes.

05:47.915 --> 05:49.850
Because of something she said
over two years ago?

05:52.953 --> 05:57.625
Shaun, stop being
a relationship archeologist.

05:57.758 --> 06:00.193
You're digging up stuff
that isn't relevant.

06:00.327 --> 06:05.198
Archeologists dig up stuff
that is very relevant.

06:05.332 --> 06:06.867
And Lea
still believes it.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.669
She changed
my client satisfa...

06:08.802 --> 06:10.804
She apologized, Shaun.

06:10.938 --> 06:13.140
You're attributing
an expired motive

06:13.273 --> 06:15.743
to her current actions.

06:15.876 --> 06:18.979
How do I know
it's expired?

06:20.213 --> 06:21.982
Because you trust her,

06:22.115 --> 06:24.585
and you love her
for who she is,

06:24.718 --> 06:29.523
a flawed, messy,
and totally wonderful
human being.

06:29.657 --> 06:31.659
****

06:38.131 --> 06:40.568
Hmm, the left external carotid

06:40.701 --> 06:41.835
is stenotic.

06:41.969 --> 06:43.103
I was right.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.838
We can't do the surgery.

06:48.942 --> 06:51.579
You have to do
the surgery.

06:51.712 --> 06:54.548
Poor flow from the carotid
could lead to graft necrosis,

06:54.682 --> 06:56.249
sepsis, and possible death.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.223
It's been a minute.

07:04.892 --> 07:05.859
You look awful.

07:06.660 --> 07:07.695
You look fake.

07:11.331 --> 07:14.101
Because of
the blood flow issues,

07:14.234 --> 07:16.203
the transplant will be riskier
than we thought,

07:16.336 --> 07:18.371
but I don't believe
prohibitively so.

07:18.506 --> 07:20.508
It's still a viable option

07:20.641 --> 07:22.543
if you feel
it's worth the risks.

07:23.310 --> 07:25.245
SHAUN: It isn't, okay?

07:25.378 --> 07:27.781
Your electrolarynx
works fine,

07:27.915 --> 07:29.883
and a normal voice
is not worth dying for.

07:32.185 --> 07:35.088
You don't sing,
do you?

07:35.222 --> 07:38.425
N-No, but even if
the transplant is successful,

07:38.559 --> 07:39.860
your new voice
may be very different

07:39.993 --> 07:41.128
from your original
singing voice.

07:41.261 --> 07:42.996
I know.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.898
I just want a voice.

07:45.933 --> 07:47.801
People don't listen
to robots.

07:50.938 --> 07:53.907
Nelly, we're talking
about your life.

07:56.376 --> 07:57.110
See?

07:58.111 --> 07:58.912
You didn't hear me.

08:01.615 --> 08:03.483
I want the surgery.

08:04.384 --> 08:05.485
Okay.

08:05.619 --> 08:06.920

08:18.866 --> 08:20.634
Nerve signaling

NURSE HAWKS:
Just a heads-up,

08:26.874 --> 08:29.109
you may be getting a call
for a reference.

08:29.242 --> 08:30.544
You're leaving St. Bon's?

08:30.678 --> 08:32.445
More like fleeing
Salen Morrison.

08:32.580 --> 08:34.615
Demoting you
is an insult to all of us.

08:36.617 --> 08:37.651
I found the culprit.

08:38.686 --> 08:40.821
Bone splinter
compressing the plexus.

08:42.756 --> 08:45.458
Well, thanks for that.
I'm sure Andrews
will do a fine job.

08:45.593 --> 08:46.627
If he's not Salen's puppet.

08:49.997 --> 08:51.965
Good news is,
no nerve laceration.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.937
I have an interview to run
trauma over at SJ General.

08:57.070 --> 08:57.971
That was fast.

08:59.506 --> 09:00.974
They need any surgical
residents?

09:01.108 --> 09:02.475
Or anesthesiologists?

(CHUCKLES)

(MONITOR BEEPS)

09:05.312 --> 09:06.980
Nerve signaling

It's an ossified ligament
compressing the cervical cord.

His arm's
permanently paralyzed.

09:14.588 --> 09:16.556
****

09:22.596 --> 09:25.699
The ossified ligament has
probably developed over years.

09:25.833 --> 09:27.234
It's why you weren't
feeling any pain.

09:28.435 --> 09:30.738
Your fall drove it
into your cervical cord.

09:30.871 --> 09:32.272
(SIGHS)

09:34.074 --> 09:36.043
Can't you remove it?

09:36.176 --> 09:38.779
It's adhered to the dura
encasing your spinal cord.

09:38.912 --> 09:42.082
The surgery to remove it
could leave you paralyzed
in multiple limbs.

09:42.215 --> 09:44.217

09:49.857 --> 09:51.391
I can't take care of Cody
with one arm.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.227
You know, if I don't have
this surgery,

09:54.361 --> 09:57.097
there's a 100% chance
that my son will be
institutionalized.

09:58.531 --> 09:59.266
I'm sorry.

10:00.801 --> 10:03.303
But I strongly recommend
against it.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.438

10:12.112 --> 10:13.113

We're starting you

10:37.504 --> 10:40.073
You may feel

10:42.409 --> 10:44.277
Dr. Allen is
a bit of a fangirl.

Hey, backstage passes
if you can talk some sense
into my sister.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.824
Dr. Andrews is the best.

10:56.957 --> 10:59.860
If he says
he can make it work,
it'll work.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.229
Dr. Murphy
doesn't think so.

11:02.362 --> 11:04.531
Dr. Andrews is
the Chief of Surgery.

11:04.664 --> 11:05.999
I'm your big sister.

11:06.133 --> 11:07.434
If I had listened to you,

11:07.567 --> 11:10.303
I would have ended
my career in fishnets.

11:10.437 --> 11:12.205
If you'd listened to me,
you'd still have a career.

11:12.339 --> 11:13.640
Yes.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.675
I should have been
wearing my seatbelt,

especially with
you driving.

11:17.610 --> 11:19.546

lousy judgment.

this whole transplant thing.

11:25.585 --> 11:27.721
Ooh, clever new spin.

If only your songs
were that smart.

11:30.123 --> 11:32.292
****

11:37.965 --> 11:39.166
Okay.

11:46.774 --> 11:49.977
You've been
at St. Bonaventure
for 17 years,

11:50.110 --> 11:51.644
went from resident
to Chief.

11:52.612 --> 11:55.115
Makes for
a pretty boring resume.

11:55.248 --> 11:57.785
It shows dedication
and a loyal following.

11:57.918 --> 11:59.920
But it does beg
the question,

12:00.620 --> 12:01.721
why now?

12:03.523 --> 12:05.358
Um...

12:05.492 --> 12:07.094
St. Bon's
has changed a lot.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.362
Well, Salen and Ethicure
will do that.

12:09.496 --> 12:11.464
(CHUCKLES)

12:11.598 --> 12:14.167
But still, man,
it's tough to leave home.

12:16.469 --> 12:18.538
Yeah.

12:18.671 --> 12:21.074
St. Bon's made me
the doctor I am, but...

12:23.310 --> 12:24.878
I don't know
if it's home anymore.

12:26.046 --> 12:29.349
Hmm.
Well, it's their loss.

My gym teacher,
Mr. Carl,

27:55.507 --> 27:57.576
tried to get
the other kids to stop.

27:59.411 --> 28:01.914
That just made it worse.

28:02.048 --> 28:06.185

coming to gym class,
he'd give me a B anyway.

So I stopped.

You gave Joe permission

people who kill babies
shouldn't run hospitals.

Adrenals are clear.

to think I was wrong.

39:58.129 --> 40:01.533
But you were wrong,
and s-so was Dr. Andrews.

40:01.667 --> 40:04.570
And it is Salen's fault.

40:04.703 --> 40:07.172
