No, to meet Ruthless
you must all travel to Paradise Island.

Great, so where do I get a ticket?

03:25.480 --> 03:27.118
It's not that simple.

03:28.200 --> 03:30.077
First, you must choose a partner...

03:30.200 --> 03:34.034
- Got one. Got one right here.
- And then you must get married.

03:34.160 --> 03:38.995
Ruthless teaches us
that you cannot reach paradise alone,

03:39.120 --> 03:42.590
so I suggest you choose wisely.

to random six-year-olds

Oh! Oh, sorry, wankers?

over the nose, she won't make a sound.

- Looks like it.

28:23.440 --> 28:25.396
- We did, like, 12 times already.
- No, no, no.

28:25.520 --> 28:29.957
We have daylight savings time
but the Russians... The Russians don't.

28:30.080 --> 28:31.559
Guys, guys!

28:31.680 --> 28:35.468
Your president, he doesn't like the gays
and he doesn't like daylight savings.

28:35.600 --> 28:40.151
He got rid of it last year. Yes?
Correct? Yes? Yes! Thank you. Yes. OK?

28:40.280 --> 28:42.430
So I'm sure
that we've taken it into account

28:42.560 --> 28:46.678
but can we please just check it,
the way that their code speaks to ours?

28:46.800 --> 28:50.998
Because otherwise the secondary engine
ignition will be about an hour late,

28:51.120 --> 28:53.873
or an hour early, whatever
the fuck daylight savings time is.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.116
- Scotty, where have you been?
- No! Not now. I'm busy.

28:58.920 --> 29:00.319
There, right there!

29:00.440 --> 29:02.192
Shit, you were right.

29:02.320 --> 29:06.279
OK, people,
we need to rewrite this interface now!

29:06.400 --> 29:08.038
(ALL TALKAT ONCE)

29:18.440 --> 29:22.672
OK, so the boat is the Earth
and I'm that naughty comet, alright?

29:22.800 --> 29:25.837
- Yeah, and I'm Operation Saviour.
- Oh, really?

29:25.960 --> 29:27.791
Well, I bet you can't save the world.

29:28.040 --> 29:29.029
(BLOWS AIR)

29:31.040 --> 29:34.191
Yes, my real name was Hawkwind.

29:35.400 --> 29:37.277
I grew up on the commune with Ariel.

29:37.400 --> 29:38.879
I hated it

29:39.000 --> 29:41.389
so I ran away with him
as soon as I could.

29:41.520 --> 29:43.317
And...

29:44.320 --> 29:47.630
stupidly married him.

29:47.760 --> 29:49.751
I was only 18.

29:50.960 --> 29:53.554
I thought I was in love
but I was young and Ionely

29:53.680 --> 29:56.069
and I wanted to belong somewhere.

29:56.200 --> 29:59.397
- If you're looking for sympathy...
- No, I'm not.

29:59.520 --> 30:02.432
I'm not.
I'm just trying to help you understand

30:02.560 --> 30:04.835
how I could have fucked up
so spectacularly.

30:07.200 --> 30:10.510
Ariel had a real chip on his shoulder
about you

30:10.640 --> 30:13.757
cos your mum was always going on
about how special you were

30:13.880 --> 30:16.235
and it made him feel like shit so...

30:17.560 --> 30:21.314
So... he invented a computer game...

30:22.320 --> 30:24.038
called Doofus.

30:24.160 --> 30:26.116
You were the main character in it.

30:27.600 --> 30:29.033
I don't understand.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.151
He hacked everything
without you realizing.

30:31.280 --> 30:33.635
Your whole life,
so credit records, emails,

30:33.760 --> 30:36.149
he fiddled with everything
to mess it up.

30:36.280 --> 30:37.599
Like what?

30:40.960 --> 30:43.952
Like screwing with your exam results?

30:45.880 --> 30:48.474
So you could have gone to university.

30:48.600 --> 30:51.160
Those rejection letters were all Ariel.

30:54.560 --> 30:56.278
And you knew?

31:01.240 --> 31:03.037
I was young and stupid,

31:03.160 --> 31:06.311
and I never thought of you
as a real person with feelings.

31:06.440 --> 31:08.112
(SNIFFS)

31:09.680 --> 31:13.673
And then one day, we were talking about
how you'd never had a girlfriend.

31:17.080 --> 31:19.674
So you invented one for me?

31:19.800 --> 31:22.758
Yeah. Layla.

31:24.440 --> 31:27.159
We set up a meet cute.

31:27.280 --> 31:29.236
I got in the lift with you
and Ariel hacked it,

31:29.360 --> 31:30.713
made it break down for a few hours.

31:30.840 --> 31:35.118
But when I met you, you were so lovely

31:35.240 --> 31:39.358
and the joke wasn't funny anymore
because everything about you...

31:40.840 --> 31:43.115
was so genuine.

31:44.880 --> 31:49.112
And being Layla
felt so much better than being Hawkwind.

31:50.160 --> 31:54.199
So I split up with Ariel
and I fooled myself.

31:55.080 --> 31:57.514
I thought Doofus was over
and I thought I could just be with you

31:57.640 --> 32:00.438
and be happy and just be Layla.

32:05.640 --> 32:07.232
And then?

32:09.800 --> 32:12.519
And then he showed up on our honeymoon.

32:14.200 --> 32:18.990
Said he'd been biding his time but
that sooner or later we'd be punished.

32:19.120 --> 32:23.193
And he was scary.
Like, eyes bulgy, proper psycho.

32:23.320 --> 32:26.312
And to add to everything,
I'd just found out I was pregnant.

32:27.560 --> 32:29.391
And I panicked.

32:32.800 --> 32:37.476
I... I thought if I just disappeared...

32:38.720 --> 32:41.871
<i>I could protect the baby from him</i>
<i>and protect you.</i>

32:43.200 --> 32:45.714
Everything was a lie.

32:45.840 --> 32:49.389
No. No, everything started as a lie

32:49.520 --> 32:51.590
but we turned into something real.

32:53.760 --> 32:55.318
<i>Cos I did love you, Jamie.</i>

32:56.320 --> 32:59.949
And when we said our wedding vows,
I meant every word.

33:00.080 --> 33:02.389
You were the best thing
that ever happened to me.

33:06.480 --> 33:08.357
Funny, cos you were the worst.

33:10.320 --> 33:12.675
I want details.

33:12.800 --> 33:16.839
And I don't care if it takes all night,
you are gonna tell me everything.

What you did...
You gave us a chance, Scotty.

Well, come on! It's about to launch
and you are the hero of the hours!

- I forgot all about it.

Looks like we're camping out tonight.

35:03.120 --> 35:04.712
What?

35:09.920 --> 35:11.512
I know this is going to sound crazy.

35:11.640 --> 35:14.791
Do you remember in Poland,
your granddaughter?

35:15.920 --> 35:19.674
She told me one day
I was going to see four horses.

35:25.120 --> 35:26.269

35:29.240 --> 35:31.196
JUDE: It is a sign.

35:33.560 --> 35:35.152
It's a billboard.

35:37.160 --> 35:41.517
Celine, do you really think
the Lord would be communicating to us

35:41.640 --> 35:43.710
using the medium of...

35:45.560 --> 35:47.755
- outside advertising?
- Well, why not?

35:47.880 --> 35:51.190
What if it is a sign,
giving us his blessing?

35:51.320 --> 35:53.390
- For what?
- For the wedding.

35:56.040 --> 35:57.393
That wasn't real.

35:58.680 --> 36:00.671
You kissed me, Jude.

36:01.440 --> 36:04.716
It was not acting. It wasn't.

36:06.600 --> 36:08.670
Was it?

36:32.640 --> 36:34.437
I wasn't acting.

But, Celine,
I've been a priest for 20 years.

36:44.400 --> 36:46.356
I've never broken my vows.

36:46.480 --> 36:48.914
And I don't think you should either.

36:49.840 --> 36:52.354
What if God wants us to?

36:52.480 --> 36:55.233
What if that is a sign?

36:55.360 --> 36:58.158
I'm afraid
it's probably wishful thinking.

36:58.280 --> 36:59.838
Why don't you ask him?

37:00.600 --> 37:01.999
Right now?

Dear Lord.

a lot on your plate right now

says that that probably has something to
do with the Saviour launch celebration.

Yes, maybe.

39:42.560 --> 39:44.391
I don't know.

Try not to argue in front of Frankie,
I suppose.

alternate weekends with her

just to put me out of my misery.

No. No, I told you,
I couldn't risk Ariel finding us.

40:11.280 --> 40:13.555
Please, Jamie, we've been up all night.

Let's just get some sleep
before we do more, OK?

40:16.080 --> 40:20.198
Why were you with him
in Moscow a few weeks ago?

40:23.040 --> 40:26.350

40:26.480 --> 40:28.994

for Frankie
