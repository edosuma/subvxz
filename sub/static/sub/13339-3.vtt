00:05.973 --> 00:07.941
- Charlie:
ARE YOUR EYES CLOSED?

00:08.042 --> 00:11.212
- ARE YOU READY
FOR THE SURPRISE?
- I'M-- I'M READY.

00:11.312 --> 00:12.913

00:13.013 --> 00:16.750
WELL, UH, OKAY.

00:23.057 --> 00:26.960
WHOO-WHEE.

00:27.061 --> 00:29.397

- YEAH.

00:29.497 --> 00:31.132
YOU LIKE IT?

00:31.232 --> 00:32.966
NO, I DON'T LIKE IT.
I-- I HATE IT.

00:33.067 --> 00:34.735
OH, NO.

00:34.835 --> 00:37.238
YOU LOOK SCARY TO ME,
LIKE MICKEY MOUSE
WITHOUT THE EARS.

00:37.338 --> 00:39.907
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

00:40.007 --> 00:42.410
- IT'S FOR JOANNA.
- WHO THE FUCK IS JOANNA?

00:42.510 --> 00:44.445
SHE'S THE RECEPTIONIST
AT THE OFFICE.

00:44.545 --> 00:47.148
SHE HAS OVARIAN CANCER
AND SHE STARTED CHEMO TODAY,

00:47.248 --> 00:49.483
AND A BUNCH OF US
ARE DOING THIS
TO SUPPORT HER.

00:49.583 --> 00:51.752
THANKS FOR TELLING ME
ABOUT THE CANCER.

00:51.852 --> 00:53.721
NOW I LOOK LIKE
A TOTAL ASSHOLE.

00:53.821 --> 00:55.423
WELL--

00:55.523 --> 00:57.691
- HOW DO I LOOK?
- ( Charlie laughs )

00:57.791 --> 01:00.261
YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'RE GONNA PUT A HEX
ON SOME POPULAR GIRLS.

01:00.361 --> 01:03.364
UH, O-OKAY,
"AMERICAN HISTORY X."

01:03.464 --> 01:05.032
OH, YEAH. HAVE FUN.
GO TWEET THAT.

01:05.132 --> 01:07.401
YOU LOOK SCARY, TOO.

01:07.501 --> 01:10.371
SCARILY HOT
SLASH AMAZING?
( hisses )

01:10.471 --> 01:13.407
WHAT IS GOING ON?
IS IT SOME KIND OF SOLSTICE?

01:13.507 --> 01:15.476
- ( door closes )
- JUST TOUCH IT.

01:15.576 --> 01:19.347
NO, I FEEL LIKE I DON'T
KNOW YOU ANYMORE.

01:19.447 --> 01:22.250
( theme music playing )

01:32.593 --> 01:35.829
- ( phone ringing )
- WHO THE FUCK?

01:40.334 --> 01:43.671
- YO, KID.
- Hannah: You home?

01:44.938 --> 01:47.175
I MEAN,
FOR THE MOMENT, SURE.

01:47.275 --> 01:49.410
Come to the window.

01:50.711 --> 01:52.646
BETTER BE GOOD.

01:54.448 --> 01:57.551
THAT YOU CREEPING AROUND
DOWNSTAIRS?

01:59.153 --> 02:02.122
OH, YOU LOOK AWESOME.
COME THE FUCK UPSTAIRS.

02:02.223 --> 02:03.857
- OKAY.
- BUT WAIT.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.993
- I HAVE TO WARN YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING.
- WHAT?

02:06.093 --> 02:07.995
IF YOU COME UP,
I'M GONNA TIE YOU TO MY BED
AND KEEP YOU FOR THREE DAYS.

02:08.095 --> 02:11.532
- I'M IN THAT KIND OF MOOD.
- OKAY, I'LL BE UP
IN A SECOND.

02:14.335 --> 02:18.105
OKAY, SO YOU LOOK, LIKE,
TOTALLY GORGEOUS AS ALWAYS.

02:18.206 --> 02:21.842
UM, AND, LIKE,
VERY CURRENT.

02:21.942 --> 02:25.713
I'M JUST WONDERING
IF IT'S MAYBE, LIKE,
A LITTLE BIT THREATENING...

02:25.813 --> 02:28.081
FOR BABYSITTING.

02:28.182 --> 02:30.551
IT'S FLOOR-LENGTH.

02:32.052 --> 02:34.622
I CAN SEE
YOUR BELLY BUTTON.

02:34.722 --> 02:36.690
RAH RAH RAH RAH RAH...

02:36.790 --> 02:40.328
- THIS IS SO HORRIBLE.
- I THINK YOUR STOMACH
IS FUNNY.

02:40.428 --> 02:42.596
WELL, MAYBE I DON'T WANT
MY BODY TO BE FUNNY.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.164
HAS THAT EVER
OCCURRED TO YOU?

02:44.265 --> 02:45.533
IT'S JUST THREE
OR FOUR POUNDS.

02:45.633 --> 02:47.301
IF YOU HATE IT SO MUCH,
YOU CAN LOSE FOUR POUNDS.

02:47.401 --> 02:49.002
WELL, I DON'T LOSE WEIGHT
FROM MY STOMACH;

02:49.102 --> 02:51.038
I LOSE WEIGHT
FROM MY FACE.

02:51.138 --> 02:54.975
YOU'VE TRIED A LOT,
TO LOSE WEIGHT?

02:55.075 --> 02:58.779
- NO, I HAVE NOT TRIED
A LOT TO LOSE WEIGHT.
- ( laughing )

02:58.879 --> 03:02.149
BECAUSE I DECIDED I WAS
GONNA HAVE OTHER CONCERNS
IN MY LIFE, OKAY?

03:02.250 --> 03:04.952
- I APOLOGIZE.
- DO YOU EAT FOR FUN?

03:05.052 --> 03:07.621
- AS OPPOSED TO WHAT?
- FOR FUEL. I EAT FOR FUEL.

03:07.721 --> 03:10.324
I REMEMBER TO EAT
WHEN MY EYES GET CLOUDY.

03:10.424 --> 03:12.226
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET ME
TO TELL YOU THAT YOU HAVE

03:12.326 --> 03:14.194
A REALLY GOOD BODY,
THEN YOU WIN.

03:14.295 --> 03:16.096
- YOU HAVE
A REALLY GOOD BODY.
- I HAVE FAT.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.698
YOU ACTUALLY
REALLY DON'T.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.600
- I'M LOOKING AT YOU,
AND YOU DON'T.
- YES, I DO.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.034
GATHER MY FAT.

03:21.134 --> 03:24.204
- I'M NOT GONNA PLAY
A DEMENTED GAME WITH YOU.
- GATHER MY FAT.

03:24.305 --> 03:26.707
YOU'LL FEEL LESS ALONE
IF YOU GATHER MY FAT.

03:28.175 --> 03:30.278
- THERE IT IS.
- THAT'S SKIN.

03:30.378 --> 03:33.180
- THAT IS ALL SKIN.
- SEE? SEE?

03:33.281 --> 03:34.948
- ( cell phone buzzing )
- THAT'S SKIN.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.551
YO, YOUR SHIT'S
BLOWING UP.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.487
YOU'RE A JERK.

03:40.187 --> 03:42.256
STOP IT.

03:42.356 --> 03:43.891
- HELLO?
- HELLO?

03:43.991 --> 03:45.459
SHH.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.395
BEATRIX, HONEY, I'M SORRY.
I CAN'T FIND IT.

03:47.495 --> 03:49.129
- ( toy squeaks )
- Beatrix: CAN I COME, TOO?

03:49.229 --> 03:51.231
NO, BABY.
MOMMY IS SHOOTING.

03:51.332 --> 03:53.501
- I'M SORRY.
COME ON.
- MWAH.

03:53.601 --> 03:55.536
Girl: SHE'S MAKING
A DOCUMENTARY
ABOUT PEOPLE

03:55.636 --> 03:58.105
WHO USED TO BE RICH,
BUT NOW THEY'RE HOMELESS.

03:58.205 --> 04:00.173
BUT THAT CAN'T
JUST HAPPEN TO YOU.

04:00.274 --> 04:01.542
YOU MAKE CHOICES
TO GET THERE.

04:01.642 --> 04:03.644
RIGHT, LIKE YOU MAKE
CHOICES TO BE MEAN

04:03.744 --> 04:05.413
TO YOUR
NEW BABYSITTER, RIGHT?

04:05.513 --> 04:06.680
WE'LL SEE WHERE
THAT GETS YOU.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.516
Beatrix:
I WISH I WAS HOMELESS.

04:08.616 --> 04:11.552
OH, BEATRIX, WE TALKED
ABOUT THIS FOR 20 MINUTES
THIS MORNING.

04:11.652 --> 04:13.721
IT IS NOT FUN.
IT'S NOT LIKE CAMPING.

04:13.821 --> 04:15.489
Beatrix:
CHARLOTTA DIDN'T
LIKE TO PLAY.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.524
- DO YOU LIKE TO PLAY?
- YEAH, I LOVE IT.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.627
Mom:
HEY, YOU GUYS, LOOKS LIKE
IT'S GONNA RAIN OUTSIDE.

04:19.726 --> 04:21.928
YOU GUYS ARE GONNA WANNA
DO SOME INSIDEY THINGS
TODAY, OKAY?

04:22.029 --> 04:24.064
AND DADDY'S
NOT COMING HOME
UNTIL ABOUT 10:00,

04:24.164 --> 04:26.066
SO JESSA'S GONNA
PUT YOU TO SLEEP.

04:26.166 --> 04:28.001
ALTHOUGH I WISH
I COULD. SORRY.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.303
SO YOU CAN
PRACTICE PIANO

04:29.403 --> 04:31.171
OR YOU COULD DO
YOUR MOSAIC WORK.

04:31.271 --> 04:34.908
OH, AND, LOLA,
I'M SURE JESSA WOULD LOVE
TO PROOFREAD YOUR NOVEL.

04:35.008 --> 04:37.378
( whispering )
HER NOVEL-- IT'S SO CUTE,
BUT IT'S ONLY 10 PAGES LONG.

04:37.478 --> 04:40.047
- OKAY.
- UGH, HOPE I'M NOT
FORGETTING ANYTHING.

04:40.147 --> 04:42.383
UH... OKAY.

04:42.483 --> 04:44.718
I WISH WE ACTUALLY
HAD TIME TO TALK.

04:44.818 --> 04:47.888
DAPHNE TOLD ME
SO MUCH ABOUT YOU,
WHAT A TRAVELER YOU ARE.

04:47.988 --> 04:49.590
- YEAH.
- OH, I ENVY THAT.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.291
I WANT TO PICK
YOUR BRAIN.

04:51.392 --> 04:53.260
- ( both laugh )
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

04:53.361 --> 04:55.963
KISS ME, KISS ME.
GOODBYE. I LOVE YOU.

04:56.063 --> 04:58.499
- GOODBYE. I LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOU.
- ( giggling )

04:58.599 --> 05:00.300
WE'LL LOOK FOR HAMPY
IN THE MORNING, OKAY?

05:00.401 --> 05:01.869
SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.
BE GOOD FOR JESSA.

05:01.969 --> 05:04.304
JESSA, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
YOU ARE A LIFESAVER.

05:04.405 --> 05:07.107
- THANK YOU.
- D-DON'T WORRY.

05:07.207 --> 05:08.609
- OKAY.
- Girl: BYE.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.544
- Beatrix: BYE, MOM.
- ( door closes )

05:10.644 --> 05:12.880
MM-HMM.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.648
NO. THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.650
THANK YOU.
YEAH, I'LL CALL,
IF I-- THANK YOU.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.919
BYE.

05:19.019 --> 05:20.954
WHO WAS THAT?

05:21.054 --> 05:23.991
THAT WAS
MY GYNECOLOGIST.

05:24.091 --> 05:26.627
AND WHAT DID SHE SAY?

05:26.727 --> 05:30.931
SHE WAS CALLING
WITH SOME NEWS ABOUT
MY VAGINA.

05:31.031 --> 05:33.100
WAS IT GOOD NEWS?

05:33.200 --> 05:36.737
I HAVE AN S.T.D.
I HAVE H.P.V.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.672
I HAVE H.P.V.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.874
- WHAT DOES THAT DO?
- I DON'T REALLY KNOW.
IT CAN CAUSE WARTS.

05:40.974 --> 05:42.810
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY.
I DON'T HAVE THOSE,

05:42.910 --> 05:44.745
BUT IT CAN ALSO CAUSE
CERVICAL CANCER,

05:44.845 --> 05:46.980
SO THAT'S WHY I HAVE TO
GET MY CERVIX SCRAPED OUT
NEXT WEEK.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.817
FUCK, I'M SO SORRY.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.321
ARE YOU SORRY BECAUSE
YOU GAVE IT TO ME?

05:54.422 --> 05:57.458
- WHAT?
- I AM PRETTY SURE
YOU GAVE IT TO ME.

05:57.558 --> 05:59.226
YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON
I'VE BEEN HAVING SEX WITH.

05:59.326 --> 06:01.128
IT IS NOT PREVENTED
BY CONDOMS.

06:01.228 --> 06:04.632
- HOLD YOUR ROLL.
I DIDN'T GIVE IT TO YOU.
- WELL, HOW DO YOU KNOW?

06:04.732 --> 06:07.200
- BECAUSE I GOT TESTED
AND I DON'T HAVE THAT.
- YOU GOT TESTED?

06:07.300 --> 06:09.002
- WHEN DID YOU GET TESTED?
- LAST WEEK.

06:09.102 --> 06:11.572
MY BEST DYKE FRIEND
WORKS FOR A DICK DOCTOR,
AND I DON'T HAVE THAT SHIT.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.306
- ARE YOU SURE?
- YEAH, I'M SURE.

06:13.407 --> 06:14.975
SO NOW YOU OWE ME
AN APOLOGY.

06:15.075 --> 06:17.310
OKAY, I'M SORRY.

06:17.411 --> 06:20.113
I MEAN, YOU HAVE TO KNOW
THAT THAT SEEMED LIKE
A NATURAL ASSUMPTION,

06:20.213 --> 06:23.183
AND I WAS
FREAKED OUT, AND--

06:23.283 --> 06:24.552
ARE YOU ANGRY
WITH ME NOW?

06:24.652 --> 06:26.687
JUST ANNOYED, YEAH.

06:29.156 --> 06:30.491
WILL YOU STILL
HAVE SEX WITH ME?

06:30.591 --> 06:33.093
WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE, SURE.

06:42.002 --> 06:44.171
CAN I HUG YOU GOODBYE?

06:44.271 --> 06:46.874
I'M BUSY.

06:46.974 --> 06:49.242
( ringing )

06:49.342 --> 06:51.378
GOOD AFTERNOON.
KWARTLER GALLERY.

06:51.479 --> 06:53.413
- Hannah: Hey, it's me.
- HI, YOU.

06:53.514 --> 06:57.451
- How are you?
- I GOT A CALL FROM
THE DOCTOR WITH MY RESULTS.

06:57.551 --> 06:59.720
AND? DO YOU--?

06:59.820 --> 07:03.223
It would appear that I do,
yes, have something.

07:03.323 --> 07:06.059
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT?

07:06.159 --> 07:10.063
I KIND OF CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT I AM SAYING THIS,
BUT I HAVE H.P.V.

07:10.163 --> 07:12.199
( crying )

07:12.299 --> 07:14.301
- MARNIE?
- ( sobs ) Yeah?

07:14.401 --> 07:16.336
ARE YOU CRYING?

07:16.436 --> 07:18.338
IT IS JUST SO UNFAIR,
HANNAH.

07:18.438 --> 07:22.309
LIKE, YOU'RE SO CAREFUL
ABOUT SEX AND EVERYTHING,
AND YOU'RE, LIKE, NERVOUS.

07:22.409 --> 07:25.646
I JUST FIGURED THAT, LIKE,
FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE REALLY,
REALLY SCARED OF FLYING,

07:25.746 --> 07:27.247
THEIR PLANES NEVER GO DOWN.

07:27.347 --> 07:29.082
IT'S JUST NOT HOW IT WORKS.

07:29.182 --> 07:30.518
OH, MY GOD.

07:30.618 --> 07:32.352
WHAT IF YOU CAN'T
HAVE CHILDREN?

07:32.452 --> 07:34.788
MARNIE, I'M FINE, OKAY?
I'M FINE.

07:34.888 --> 07:37.324
- FUCKING ADAM.
- He didn't give it
to me, okay?

07:37.424 --> 07:38.826
He got tested
and he doesn't have it.

07:38.926 --> 07:41.094
- I THINK IT WAS ELIJAH.
- Elijah?

07:41.194 --> 07:42.596
BUT ELIJAH'S SUCH A LOSER.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.698
HE HAD ONLY SLEPT
WITH ONE PERSON
BEFORE YOU.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.900
IT WAS THAT CELLIST
WITH THE LOOSE JOINT DISORDER.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.202
I KNOW, AND SHE'S ALWAYS, LIKE,
LIKING MY FACEBOOK STATUS.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.304
IT'S SUCH A WEIRD,
AGGRESSIVE MOVE.

07:51.404 --> 07:54.274
IT'S LIKE, "SORRY I PASSED
YOU AN S.T.D., BUT I ENJOY
YOUR QUIRKY WEB PRESENCE."

07:54.374 --> 07:57.811
( laughs )
HOW CAN YOU JOKE AT A TIME
LIKE THIS, HANNAH?

07:57.911 --> 08:01.381
BECAUSE I'M FINE
AND I'M NOT GONNA DIE,
SO I'M FINE.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.183
Well, okay.

08:04.652 --> 08:06.353
I REALLY HATE
TO BRING THIS UP,

08:06.453 --> 08:08.722
BUT, YOU KNOW,
RENT IS DUE IN A WEEK.

08:08.822 --> 08:12.693
- The job search?
- I HAVE PRECANCER.

08:16.897 --> 08:19.533
Beatrix:
"MY NEIGHBOR IS NAMED
CHAMAID LYRONS.

08:19.633 --> 08:22.269
SHE SUPPORTED ME
WHEN NO ONE ELSE DID,

08:22.369 --> 08:24.471
RIGHT AFTER
MY HUSBAND CHUCK DIED

08:24.572 --> 08:26.874
AND I LEFT
THE ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS

08:26.974 --> 08:29.643
AND I ALMOST NEVER LEFT FROM
UNDER MY DINING ROOM TABLE."

08:29.743 --> 08:32.546
- IS "SHUH-MADE"
HOW YOU SAY IT?
- YES.

08:32.645 --> 08:38.184
- HOW DO YOU SPELL THAT?
- C-H-A-M-A-I-D.

08:38.284 --> 08:40.486
THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL NAME.

08:40.587 --> 08:42.756
- DID YOU COME UP
WITH THAT?
- YES.

08:43.890 --> 08:46.927
STORY'S GREAT,
REALLY GREAT.

08:47.027 --> 08:50.063
LOVING THIS STRING CHEESE.
KEEP GOING.

08:50.163 --> 08:52.132
- ( TV playing )
- ( toilet flushes )

08:52.232 --> 08:55.002
- THANKS FOR LETTING ME
CHANGE HERE, SHOSHANNA.
- MM-HMM.

08:55.102 --> 08:57.605
DO YOU KNOW WHERE JESSA IS?
DO YOU KNOW WHEN
SHE'LL BE HOME?

08:57.705 --> 09:00.741
PROBABLY NOT TILL LATE.
SHE HAS A JOB NOW.

09:00.841 --> 09:03.911
OKAY, I GUESS
EVERYBODY HAS A JOB NOW.

09:04.011 --> 09:07.815
- ( crowd groaning )
- OH, MY EFFING "G," NO.

09:07.915 --> 09:10.417
- WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING?
- "BAGGAGE."

09:10.517 --> 09:12.986
"BAGGAGE"?
WHAT'S "BAGGAGE"?

09:13.086 --> 09:15.989
IT'S, LIKE, MY FAVORITE SHOW
ON GAME SHOW NETWORK.

09:16.089 --> 09:17.625
NO, SHE DIDN'T.

09:17.725 --> 09:19.426
MARNIE AND I DON'T HAVE CABLE,
SO I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT.

09:19.526 --> 09:21.995
SHUT UP. NO WAY.
GET OVER HERE NOW.

09:22.095 --> 09:24.197
OKAY, SO, THERE ARE
THREE CONTESTANTS.

09:24.297 --> 09:25.498
TODAY THEY'RE GIRLS.

09:25.599 --> 09:26.767
AND THIS GUY DANNY
IS LOOKING FOR LOVE,

09:26.867 --> 09:28.268
AND THEY EACH HAVE
THREE SUITCASES--

09:28.368 --> 09:29.937
A LITTLE ONE,
A MEDIUM ONE,
AND A BIG ONE.

09:30.037 --> 09:32.105
AND IN THEM THEY HAVE,
LIKE, THEIR SECRET BAGGAGE

09:32.205 --> 09:33.607
AND THEY REVEAL IT.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.208
AND IF IT'S SUPER FREAKY,
HE ELIMINATES THEM.

09:35.308 --> 09:37.711
- OKAY, LIKE THIS CHICK--
- THE BLACK ONE
OR THE BLONDE ONE?

09:37.811 --> 09:39.647
YEAH, THE BLACK ONE.
HER LITTLEST BAGGAGE

09:39.747 --> 09:42.115
IS THAT SHE SPENDS
$1,000 A MONTH
ON HER WEAVE,

09:42.215 --> 09:44.985
WHICH HOST JERRY SPRINGER
THINKS IS "UN-BE-WEAVE-ABLE."

09:45.085 --> 09:47.454
HER MEDIUM BAGGAGE IS THAT
SHE PLANS HER WEDDING
AFTER THE FIRST DATE,

09:47.554 --> 09:50.090
AND HER BIGGEST BAGGAGE
IS THAT SHE POKES HOLES
IN CONDOMS.

09:50.190 --> 09:51.558
- WHOA!
- MM.

09:51.659 --> 09:54.494
- THAT'S A CRAZY THING TO DO.
- I KNOW.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.329
WHAT WOULD YOU PUT
IN YOUR BAGGAGE?

09:56.429 --> 09:57.665
I DON'T KNOW,
I FEEL LIKE--

09:57.765 --> 10:00.000
SO LIKE, FOR ME,
I THINK THAT

10:00.100 --> 10:04.137
MY LITTLEST BAGGAGE
WOULD PROBABLY BE MY I.B.S.

10:04.237 --> 10:08.475
AND MY MEDIUM BAGGAGE
WOULD BE THAT I TRULY
DON'T LOVE MY GRANDMOTHER.

10:08.575 --> 10:10.477
- LIKE, YOU DON'T
LOVE HER AT ALL?
- MM-MM.

10:10.577 --> 10:12.612
SO THEN WHAT WOULD
YOUR BIGGEST BAGGAGE BE?

10:12.713 --> 10:15.415
THAT I'M A VIRGIN.

10:15.515 --> 10:17.484
OBVIOUSLY.

10:17.584 --> 10:19.787
YEAH, BUT THAT DOESN'T
COUNT BECAUSE SOON YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE SEX

10:19.887 --> 10:21.621
AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA FORGET
YOU EVER DIDN'T HAVE SEX

10:21.722 --> 10:24.591
AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO PICK A NEW BAGGAGE,
SO IT DOESN'T COUNT.

10:24.692 --> 10:27.127
I HOPE SO.

10:27.227 --> 10:28.662
WHAT'S YOURS?

10:28.762 --> 10:30.998
LET'S SEE,
MY LITTLEST BAGGAGE

10:31.098 --> 10:34.968
IS PROBABLY THAT I AM UNFIT
FOR ANY AND ALL PAYING JOBS.

10:35.068 --> 10:37.504
MY MEDIUM BAGGAGE
IS THAT I JUST BOUGHT
FOUR CUPCAKES

10:37.604 --> 10:38.906
AND ATE ONE
IN YOUR BATHROOM.

10:39.006 --> 10:42.542
AND MY BIGGEST BAGGAGE
IS THAT I HAVE H.P.V.,

10:42.642 --> 10:44.311
WHICH I FOUND OUT TODAY.

10:44.411 --> 10:45.679
OH, MY GOD,
DO YOU HAVE WARTS?

10:45.779 --> 10:47.881
NO, I DON'T HAVE WARTS,
BUT, LIKE--

10:47.981 --> 10:49.983
I HAVEN'T LOOKED
DEEP INSIDE MYSELF,

10:50.083 --> 10:51.551
BUT I DON'T SEE
ANY WARTS.

10:51.651 --> 10:55.088
OH. IT'S, LIKE,
MUCH LESS BAD, THEN.

10:55.188 --> 10:56.523
JESSA HAS H.P.V.

10:56.623 --> 10:57.825
SHE DOES?
SHE NEVER TOLD ME THAT.

10:57.925 --> 10:59.626
YEAH, LIKE A COUPLE
STRAINS OF IT.

10:59.727 --> 11:02.295
SHE SAYS THAT
ALL ADVENTUROUS WOMEN DO.

11:02.395 --> 11:03.831
DO YOU KNOW
WHO GAVE IT TO YOU?

11:03.931 --> 11:05.432
OKAY, I THOUGHT IT WAS
THE GUY THAT I'M SEEING,

11:05.532 --> 11:07.434
BUT HE'S GOTTEN TESTED,
SO NOW I THINK IT WAS ELIJAH,

11:07.534 --> 11:10.103
- MY BOYFRIEND FOR THE LAST
TWO YEARS OF COLLEGE.
- MM-HMM.

11:10.203 --> 11:11.872
WHO BROKE UP WITH WHO?

11:11.972 --> 11:14.407
OKAY, HE BROKE UP WITH ME
BECAUSE HE NEEDED "SPACE."

11:14.507 --> 11:19.246
BUT THEN HE CALLED ME
EVERY DAY FOR SIX MONTHS
CRYING, SO...

11:19.346 --> 11:21.915
- YOU HAVE TO TELL HIM.
- ABOUT MY H.P.V.?

11:22.015 --> 11:23.751
- MM-HMM.
- YEAH, BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE
ANY SYMPTOMS FOR GUYS,

11:23.851 --> 11:25.853
AND ALSO IT WOULD OPEN
A LOT OF OLD WOUNDS FOR HIM.

11:25.953 --> 11:27.320
I THINK HE'S STILL
IN LOVE WITH ME.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.622
YEAH, BUT IT'S TOTALLY
THE RESPONSIBLE THING TO DO.

11:29.723 --> 11:31.058
AND SOMETIMES YOU HAVE
TO BREAK A FEW EGGS

11:31.158 --> 11:32.726
TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

11:32.826 --> 11:34.762
LIKE, DO YOU REALLY WANT
ALL OF HIS FUTURE LOVERS

11:34.862 --> 11:36.897
TO SUFFER THE SAME
DISEASE THAT YOU HAVE?
NO OFFENSE.

11:36.997 --> 11:39.066
YEAH, BUT I THOUGHT YOU SAID
IT'S NOT THAT BIG A DEAL.

11:39.166 --> 11:41.601
NO, IT'S TOTALLY
NOT THAT BIG A DEAL,
BUT IT'S STILL LIKE--

11:41.701 --> 11:43.136
I MEAN, JUST, LIKE,
IN THE S.T.D. WORLD,

11:43.236 --> 11:44.637
I THINK THAT'S
KIND OF COURTEOUS.

11:44.738 --> 11:46.206
DO YOU HAVE TO
DO IT IN PERSON?

11:46.306 --> 11:48.809
UM, I DON'T KNOW.

11:48.909 --> 11:50.343
LIKE, WHAT ARE
THE OTHER OPTIONS?

11:50.443 --> 11:52.045
I'M JUST WORRIED THAT
IF WE SEE EACH OTHER,

11:52.145 --> 11:53.814
WE'RE GONNA
END UP HAVING SEX.

11:53.914 --> 11:56.149
BUT, LIKE, THAT'S OKAY
BECAUSE YOU BOTH ALREADY
HAVE H.P.V.

11:57.851 --> 12:00.720
GOD, THAT'S A REALLY
GOOD POINT.

12:00.821 --> 12:03.223
- ( music playing )
- ( chatter )

12:05.859 --> 12:07.861
HEY, GOOD TO SEE YOU.

12:16.069 --> 12:19.472
MARNIE, I THINK ONE
OF THESE PAINTINGS
IS UP CROOKED.

12:19.572 --> 12:20.707
WHAT MAKES YOU
SAY THAT?

12:20.808 --> 12:22.475
BECAUSE I LOOKED
AT IT, AND IT IS.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.344
JULIAN, BE A LAMB.

12:24.444 --> 12:27.280
RUN AND GRAB
MY TIT TAPE.

12:27.380 --> 12:31.484
HE'S GOT TO HAVE
A SERIOUS CASE
OF TALL DICK.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.621
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL TONIGHT.
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT.

12:34.721 --> 12:36.556
- THANK YOU.
- ( gasps ) BOOTH JONATHAN.

12:36.656 --> 12:38.826
BOOTH JONATHAN,
GET OVER HERE.

12:38.926 --> 12:41.895
I DO NOT APPROVE OF YOU
FUCKING KOI SCHARF.

12:41.995 --> 12:44.231
YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY
ABOUT MEN WHO FUCK
ASIAN WOMEN.

12:44.331 --> 12:46.633
I KNOW WHAT YOU SAY
ABOUT MEN WHO AREN'T
FUCKING YOU ANYMORE.

12:46.733 --> 12:47.868
SHAME ON YOU.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.803
THIS LITTLE GIRL
IS A POWERHOUSE.

12:49.903 --> 12:52.705
SHE'S MY JACKIE O.
YOU SHOULD FUCK HER.

12:52.806 --> 12:55.843
DON'T FUCK
KOI SCHARF,
FUCK HER.

12:55.943 --> 12:57.577
SHE SAYS SHE HAS
A "BOYFRIEND,"

12:57.677 --> 12:59.847
BUT I'VE NEVER
SEEN HIM.

12:59.947 --> 13:01.548
BYE, REESE.

13:01.648 --> 13:04.551
I CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE JUST--

13:08.655 --> 13:10.924
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT THAT.

13:11.024 --> 13:13.026
I'M KIND OF MORTIFIED.
I MEAN, SHE'S A LITTLE
BIT DRUNK.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.528
IT'S JUST THAT I AM

13:15.628 --> 13:18.231
KIND OF A HUGE FAN
OF YOUR WORK.

13:18.331 --> 13:19.933
SO I DIDN'T WANT
TO GIVE OFF THE--

13:20.033 --> 13:22.802
TRY AND GIVE
LESS OF A SHIT.

13:23.703 --> 13:25.638
OKAY.

13:25.738 --> 13:27.908
THANKS.

13:30.743 --> 13:33.546
* YOU KNOW, BABY

13:33.646 --> 13:37.317
* I KNOW YOU THINK WE CAN
MAKE IT ALL WORK OUT *

13:37.417 --> 13:40.888
* BUT I GOTTA TELL IT
LIKE IT IS *

13:40.988 --> 13:44.424
* AND I DON'T WANNA
MAKE THIS ANY HARDER
THAN IT NEEDS TO BE *

13:44.524 --> 13:47.194
- * SO DON'T CRY...
- OH, MY GOD, HI.

13:47.294 --> 13:49.262
- HI.
- HI.

13:49.362 --> 13:51.198
- HEY.
- MM.

13:51.298 --> 13:52.966
- HEY.
- HEY.

13:54.001 --> 13:56.269
- HEY.
- HEY.

13:56.369 --> 13:59.039
- YOU CUT YOUR HAIR.
IT LOOKS GREAT.
- YES. OH, THANK YOU.

13:59.139 --> 14:01.374
YEAH. REMEMBER THAT TIME
YOU GREW A BEARD AND
THEN YOU SHAVED IT,

14:01.474 --> 14:03.977
AND THEN I DIDN'T REMEMBER
WHAT YOUR FACE LOOKED LIKE,
SO I CRIED?

14:04.077 --> 14:05.913
( laughs )
YES, THAT WAS--
THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

14:06.013 --> 14:08.481
DO I LOOK
THE SAME TO YOU?

14:08.581 --> 14:09.849
HAVE YOU LOST WEIGHT?

14:09.950 --> 14:11.718
IF I HAVE,
IT'S ONLY A FEW POUNDS.

14:11.818 --> 14:13.053
I THINK PEOPLE
JUST REMEMBER ME FATTER.

14:13.153 --> 14:16.156
OH, NO, HANNAH.
YOU WERE NEVER FAT.

14:16.256 --> 14:20.860
YOU WERE SOFT AND ROUND,
LIKE A DUMPLING.

14:21.761 --> 14:23.330
THANK YOU.

14:23.430 --> 14:25.198
YOU'RE WELCOME.

14:25.298 --> 14:27.267
SO HOW'S WORK?
ARE YOU STILL AT
THE ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE PLACE?

14:27.367 --> 14:31.071
OH, NO, NO.
ACTUALLY, I'VE TAKEN
AN EXCITING NEW POSITION.

14:31.171 --> 14:33.840
I'M AN ASSISTANT
TO A CURATOR OF DANCE.

14:33.941 --> 14:35.842
- OH, WOW.
- YEAH, IT'S UNPAID,

14:35.943 --> 14:37.978
BUT IT COULD VERY WELL
LEAD TO SOMETHING.

14:38.078 --> 14:39.579
BUT WHAT ABOUT YOU?

14:39.679 --> 14:41.949
- I MEAN,
HOW'S THE WRITING?
- WELL, IT'S GREAT.

14:42.049 --> 14:44.617
I'M ACTUALLY--
I'M ALMOST DONE
WITH A BOOK OF ESSAYS.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.954
THAT'S AMAZING.
IS IT TITLED?

14:47.054 --> 14:48.655
RIGHT NOW
IT'S "MIDNIGHT SNACK"

14:48.755 --> 14:50.623
IS THE TITLE,
THE WORKING TITLE.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.494
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
THERE'S LOTS OF TITLES.

14:54.594 --> 14:57.330
UM, IT'S REALLY GREAT
TO HEAR FROM YOU.

14:57.430 --> 14:58.898
REALLY GREAT
TO HEAR FROM YOU.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.633
I MEAN,
I'VE BEEN THINKING

15:00.733 --> 15:02.902
HOW MUCH I WANTED
TO SPEAK WITH YOU.

15:03.003 --> 15:05.505
WELL, ELIJAH,
I'M REALLY HAPPY
TO SEE YOU, TOO.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.640
- I DON'T WANT
TO MISLEAD YOU.
- MM-HMM.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.909
I DID NOT BRING YOU HERE
TO RETREAD OLD TERRITORY
EMOTIONALLY.

15:10.010 --> 15:12.545
- OKAY.
- I'M MORE OPEN
TO IT PHYSICALLY,

15:12.645 --> 15:15.248
AND I BROUGHT YOU HERE
TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING
PRETTY SPECIFIC.

15:15.348 --> 15:17.817
- WHICH IS
A LITTLE BIT TOUCHY.
- ALL RIGHT.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.786
I DON'T WANNA ASSUME
ANYTHING ABOUT YOU
AND OTHER PARTNERS.

15:19.886 --> 15:21.354
IT'S TRUE.

15:21.454 --> 15:23.323
IT'S TRUE?

15:23.423 --> 15:27.127
( sighs )
AND I HATE THAT
YOU FOUND OUT THROUGH

15:27.227 --> 15:29.562
THE POST-COLLEGIATE
RUMOR MILL.

15:29.662 --> 15:31.731
BUT I'M GLAD THAT YOU HEARD,
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

15:31.831 --> 15:33.466
THINGS WITH BEAU
ARE MOVING SO QUICKLY,

15:33.566 --> 15:36.869
AND I JUST FELT LIKE
EVENTUALLY WE WERE GOING
TO EITHER SEE YOU, OR--

15:36.970 --> 15:38.471
BEAU?

15:38.571 --> 15:40.640
WELL, THAT'S HIS NAME, YES.

15:40.740 --> 15:43.743
AND BEAU IS?

15:43.843 --> 15:45.945
MY LOVER.

15:46.046 --> 15:48.715
WHO'S MALE?

15:49.682 --> 15:51.418
YES.

15:51.518 --> 15:53.353
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.689
OH.

15:56.789 --> 16:00.027
SO YOU'RE GAY?

16:00.127 --> 16:02.062
OH, WELL, I DON'T, UM--

16:02.162 --> 16:04.998
I DON'T SAY GAY.

16:05.098 --> 16:06.499
I DON'T SAY
STRAIGHT, EITHER.

16:06.599 --> 16:09.569
I'M-- I'M WITH A PERSON
OF MY OWN GENDER,

16:09.669 --> 16:12.639
WHICH ESSENTIALLY MEANS
THAT I AM, YOU KNOW--

16:12.739 --> 16:15.142
- EXPERIMENTING.
- UM--

16:15.242 --> 16:17.277
- WHICH I LOVE.
- WELL, THANK YOU.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.579
- WHICH I LOVE.
- THANK YOU.

16:19.679 --> 16:21.048
OH, HANNAH.

16:21.148 --> 16:22.715
HANNAH, HANNAH, HANNAH,
HANNAH, HANNAH.

16:22.815 --> 16:23.850
- DON'T--
- DON'T.

16:23.950 --> 16:25.285
- DON'T.
- OKAY, OKAY.

16:25.385 --> 16:26.953
I'M FINE.

16:27.054 --> 16:29.956
WHAT I'M HAVING RIGHT NOW
IS AN INAPPROPRIATE
PHYSICAL REACTION

16:30.057 --> 16:32.325
TO MY TOTAL JOY FOR YOU
AND YOUR SELF-DISCOVERY.

16:32.425 --> 16:33.993
WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.

16:34.094 --> 16:37.197
AND LISTEN,
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT THIS EXPLORATION

16:37.297 --> 16:41.334
WAS VERY MUCH
INSPIRED BY YOU.

16:41.434 --> 16:43.370
- AND--
- I DO EXPLORE.

16:43.470 --> 16:45.305
- YOU DO.
- I MEAN, RIGHT NOW
I'M SEEING THIS GUY,

16:45.405 --> 16:47.174
AND SOMETIMES
I LET HIM HIT ME

16:47.274 --> 16:49.676
ON THE SIDE OF MY BODY.

16:52.112 --> 16:55.482
I MEAN, THAT'S GREAT
THAT YOU'RE SEEING SOMEONE.

16:55.582 --> 16:57.450
- Marnie: WHY ARE WE RUNNING?
- COME ON, DON'T BE LIKE THAT.

16:57.550 --> 17:00.187
THE HIGH LINE
IS KINDA BULLSHIT,
BUT IT'LL WORK.

17:00.287 --> 17:03.056
- OH, THE HIGH LINE'S CUTE.
- NO, IT'S NOT.

17:03.156 --> 17:06.626
SLOW DOWN.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.627
- Booth: WHAT? NO.
- ( metal rattles )

17:08.728 --> 17:11.998
HAVE YOU EVER COME HERE
WITH, LIKE, A BOOK
AND SOME FRIENDS?

17:12.098 --> 17:15.268
- IT'S A LAME SUGGESTION.
- ( metal rattling )

17:15.367 --> 17:19.372
- Marnie: IT CLOSES AT 10:00.
- YEAH, I SEE THAT.

17:22.209 --> 17:24.743
OH, YOU KNOW, SMOKING
IS REALLY BAD FOR YOU.

17:24.844 --> 17:26.378
- WHAT, CIGARETTES?
- YEAH.

17:26.479 --> 17:29.882
OH, HOLY SHIT.
I HAD NO IDEA.
THANK YOU.

17:29.982 --> 17:32.619
- ( laughs )
YOU'RE WELCOME.
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.589
SO, DO YOU LIVE
WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND?

17:36.689 --> 17:40.026
- NO, I LIVE WITH
MY BEST FRIEND.
- SHE CUTE?

17:40.127 --> 17:42.262
- IS SHE?
- NO!

17:42.362 --> 17:44.397
I MEAN, YES, SHE'S CUTE,
BUT I WOULD NEVER

17:44.497 --> 17:46.533
LET HER ANYWHERE NEAR
SOMEONE LIKE YOU.

17:46.633 --> 17:49.836
- OH, BURN!
- YEAH, WELL, YOU USUALLY
HOOK UP WITH, LIKE,

17:49.936 --> 17:51.838
FRENCH GIRLS
AND MODELS, RIGHT?

17:51.938 --> 17:54.374
NOT ALL THE TIME.

17:54.474 --> 17:56.176
- ( Marnie laughs )
- SOMETIMES.

17:56.276 --> 17:57.844
- SOMETIMES?
- MOST OF THE TIME.

17:57.944 --> 17:59.612
YEAH.

18:03.183 --> 18:05.252
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE
TO SAY SOMETHING.

18:05.352 --> 18:07.487
- WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY?
- ( laughs )

18:07.587 --> 18:09.989
I FEEL LIKE
I SHOULD TELL YOU
THAT I'M NOT GONNA--

18:10.089 --> 18:11.458
I'M NOT GONNA KISS YOU.

18:11.558 --> 18:14.227
WHY WOULD YOU THINK
THAT I WOULD WANNA KISS YOU?

18:14.327 --> 18:16.263
I DON'T KN-- I WAS
GOING OUT ON A LIMB.

18:16.363 --> 18:17.697
DON'T MAKE ME FEEL STUPID.

18:17.797 --> 18:20.333
WHEN YOU ASSUME, YOU MAKE
AN ASS OUT OF YOU AND ME.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.769
YOU SEE,
THAT'S A SAYING.

18:22.869 --> 18:26.139
- PEOPLE SAY THAT.
- IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME
SINCE I HEARD THAT.

18:26.239 --> 18:28.275
WELL, TOUCHE.

18:28.375 --> 18:30.777
I JUST FELT LIKE
I HAD TO SAY IT,

18:30.877 --> 18:33.846
- BOOTH JONATHAN.
- OKAY.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.882
- OKAY?
- I SEE.

18:42.355 --> 18:45.091
BUT I WANT YOU
TO KNOW,

18:45.192 --> 18:47.059
THE FIRST TIME
I FUCK YOU,

18:47.160 --> 18:49.095
I MIGHT SCARE YOU
A LITTLE

18:49.196 --> 18:50.997
BECAUSE I'M A MAN,

18:51.097 --> 18:53.400
AND I KNOW
HOW TO DO THINGS.

18:55.101 --> 18:56.736
SEE YOU LATER.

19:03.109 --> 19:05.478
( music playing )

19:22.195 --> 19:23.930
( lock clicks )

19:28.000 --> 19:30.803
( gasping )

19:58.231 --> 20:00.267
( clatters )

20:03.035 --> 20:05.071
- HEY. JEFF.
- HI. JESSA.

20:05.171 --> 20:07.307
- YEAH, BABYSITTER.
- YEAH, NICE TO MEET YOU.

20:07.407 --> 20:09.776
THANKS.
SO, HOW'D IT GO?

20:09.876 --> 20:11.711
WITH WHAT?

20:11.811 --> 20:13.179
UM...

20:13.280 --> 20:15.181
OH, THE KIDS.

20:15.282 --> 20:17.784
OH, BEA IS SO CUTE.

20:17.884 --> 20:21.354
YEAH, SHE FELL OVER
AND I KICKED HER IN THE HEAD
TRYING TO GET HER UP.

20:21.454 --> 20:23.990
SHE'S SO RESILIENT.

20:24.090 --> 20:25.525
HOW WAS YOUR NIGHT?

20:25.625 --> 20:28.227
OH, I'M, LIKE,
TOTALLY DESTROYED.

20:28.328 --> 20:31.063
I WENT ON A TRULY
PATHETIC OUTING

20:31.163 --> 20:32.632
TO THE BOWERY BALLROOM.

20:32.732 --> 20:36.135
IS THERE ANYTHING SADDER
THAN A BAND ROCKING OUT

20:36.235 --> 20:37.470
TO A COMPLETELY EMPTY ROOM?

20:37.570 --> 20:40.373
I'M SORRY NO ONE CAME
TO SEE YOUR BAND.

20:40.473 --> 20:42.609
NO, IT WASN'T MY BAND.

20:42.709 --> 20:44.210
- I MEAN, I'M NOT--
- OH. OH.

20:44.311 --> 20:46.379
IT WAS MY FRIEND'S.
ANYWAY, THEY WERE AWFUL.

20:46.479 --> 20:48.281
WELL, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE THEY WEREN'T AWFUL.

20:48.381 --> 20:51.751
MAYBE-- MAYBE
YOUR TASTE IS AWFUL.

20:54.454 --> 20:57.256
- DO YOU SMOKE POT?
- YEAH.

20:59.158 --> 21:01.561
OKAY.
UM, OKAY.

21:01.661 --> 21:04.464
YEAH, OKAY.

21:04.564 --> 21:06.366
Hannah:
SO I'M PROCESSING THIS.

21:06.466 --> 21:08.635
DOES THIS MEAN
THAT THE WHOLE TIME

21:08.735 --> 21:11.771
WE WERE TOGETHER,
YOU WERE...?

21:11.871 --> 21:13.840
OH, I MEAN, ARE YOU--

21:13.940 --> 21:18.545
YOU'RE ASKING DID I ALWAYS
WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH MEN?

21:19.812 --> 21:21.548
YES.

21:21.648 --> 21:25.785
ARE YOU ASKING
DID I THINK ABOUT IT
WHEN WE WERE TOGETHER?

21:27.086 --> 21:29.356
UH, YES.

21:29.456 --> 21:31.223
SO THEN HOW WERE YOU ABLE
TO HAVE SEX WITH ME?

21:31.324 --> 21:33.460
WELL, THERE'S A--

21:33.560 --> 21:37.364
THERE'S A HANDSOMENESS
TO YOU, JUST--

21:37.464 --> 21:41.067
- OH, MY GOD.
- ALL RIGHT, THAT'S-- MAYBE
THAT WASN'T THE RIGHT--

21:41.167 --> 21:43.269
WELL, I AM VERY,
VERY HAPPY FOR YOU.

21:43.370 --> 21:45.271
THANK YOU.
IT MEANS A LOT TO ME.

21:45.372 --> 21:46.806
BUT I DO WISH
THAT YOU COULD HAVE

21:46.906 --> 21:48.508
MAYBE FIGURED THIS OUT
A LITTLE BIT SOONER,

21:48.608 --> 21:50.610
LIKE MAYBE WHEN WE WERE
AT LIBERAL ARTS COLLEGE,

21:50.710 --> 21:52.879
BECAUSE THERE WERE
A LOT OF GAY MEN THERE.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.781
OKAY, OKAY.
NOW I JUST FEEL

21:54.881 --> 21:57.316
THERE'S A LOT OF AGGRESSION
COMING OFF OF YOU.

21:57.417 --> 21:59.251
AND ALSO, I WANNA
LET YOU KNOW

21:59.352 --> 22:00.587
THAT THE REASON
I BROUGHT YOU HERE

22:00.687 --> 22:02.855
WAS NOT TO DISCUSS
OUR PAST RELATIONSHIP,

22:02.955 --> 22:05.525
BUT TO DISCUSS THE FACT
THAT I HAVE AN S.T.D.

22:05.625 --> 22:08.160
AND I'M PRETTY FUCKING SURE
YOU GAVE IT TO ME.

22:08.260 --> 22:09.662
WHY WOULD YOU THINK THAT?

22:09.762 --> 22:11.564
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN
HAVING PROTECTED SEX

22:11.664 --> 22:13.199
WITH MY CURRENT BOYFRIEND

22:13.299 --> 22:14.834
AND ALSO HE DOESN'T
HAVE H.P.V.

22:14.934 --> 22:17.437
- H.P.V.?
- HE WAS TESTED
AND HE DOESN'T HAVE IT.

22:17.537 --> 22:20.840
- OH, YOUR BOYFRIEND
WAS TESTED FOR H.P.V.?
- YES.

22:20.940 --> 22:24.343
- WELL, THAT'S ABSURD.
- AND WHY IS THAT ABSURD?

22:24.444 --> 22:26.779
BECAUSE THERE IS
NO TEST FOR MEN.

22:26.879 --> 22:29.749
THERE IS NO WAY A MAN
CAN BE TESTED FOR H.P.V.,

22:29.849 --> 22:31.784
AND YOUR BOYFRIEND
WOULD KNOW THAT

22:31.884 --> 22:35.354
HAD HE EVEN TAKEN
AN INTRO-LEVEL TO HUMAN
SEXUALITY WORKSHOP.

22:35.455 --> 22:37.457
OKAY, SO YOU'RE SAYING
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE IT.

22:37.557 --> 22:39.592
NO, I'M SAYING
THAT THERE'S NO WAY
FOR ME TO KNOW.

22:39.692 --> 22:41.628
AND QUITE FRANKLY, HANNAH,
I RESENT THE ACCUSATION.

22:41.728 --> 22:44.130
YOU WERE-- YOU WERE
ALWAYS LIKE THIS.

22:44.230 --> 22:45.565
OKAY, THIS IS NOT
THE TIME FOR YOU

22:45.665 --> 22:47.099
TO THROW STONES,
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?

22:47.199 --> 22:48.300
I'M THE ONE
WHO WAS LIED TO--

22:48.401 --> 22:50.903
- BY WHO?
- BY YOU, FOR TWO YEARS.

22:51.003 --> 22:52.739
WELL, I THINK IT WAS
MAYA ANGELOU WHO SAID,

22:52.839 --> 22:55.174
"WE ARE ONLY AS BLIND
AS WE WANNA BE."

22:55.274 --> 22:59.245
SO YOU'RE SAYING
THAT I WAS SUPPOSED
TO KNOW THAT YOU WERE GAY?

22:59.345 --> 23:00.947
BECAUSE LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHING--

23:01.047 --> 23:02.849
THIS FRUITY LITTLE VOICE
THAT YOU'VE PUT ON...

23:02.949 --> 23:05.384
- EXCUSE ME?
- ...IS A NEW THING.

23:05.485 --> 23:08.020
FRUITY LITTLE VOI--
FRUITY LITTLE VOICE?

23:08.120 --> 23:09.589
KEEP YOUR V--
KEEP IT DOWN.

23:09.689 --> 23:11.658
- IS THIS ABOUT THE SCARF?
- IT'S NOT ABOUT THE SCARF.

23:11.758 --> 23:14.326
THE SCARF IS NOT
HELPING THE SITUATION,

23:14.427 --> 23:16.563
BUT IT'S ABOUT
YOUR TONE OF VOICE,

23:16.663 --> 23:18.397
IT'S ABOUT
YOUR MANNERISMS.

23:18.498 --> 23:20.132
- AND IN MY HEAD--
- I AM MY AUTHENTIC SELF.

23:20.232 --> 23:21.601
I AM BEING
MY AUTHENTIC SELF.

23:21.701 --> 23:23.770
IF YOU HAD BEEN
THIS GAY IN COLLEGE,

23:23.870 --> 23:25.572
I WOULD HAVE KNOWN BECAUSE
I HAVE TWO EYEBALLS,

23:25.672 --> 23:27.273
- TWO EARS--
- REALLY?

23:27.373 --> 23:29.709
YOU MIGHT WANNA TAKE
SOME STEPS BACK THROUGH
YOUR OTHER BOYFRIENDS.

23:29.809 --> 23:32.479
AND NOT FOR NOTHING,
MAYBE TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR DAD.

23:33.613 --> 23:35.347
YOU DIDN'T JUST.

23:35.448 --> 23:37.349
I DID.

23:37.450 --> 23:39.418
IN WHAT WAY DOES MY FATHER
READ GAY TO YOU?

23:39.519 --> 23:42.722
UH, WELL, HE HAS
A STUD IN HIS EAR.

23:42.822 --> 23:46.158
HE GOT IT ON A TRIP
HE TOOK WITH A BUNCH
OF HIS MALE FRIENDS.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.697
- I HEARD WHAT
THAT SOUNDED LIKE.
- ARE WE HEARING OURSELVES?

23:50.797 --> 23:53.399
- I DON'T THINK WE ARE.
- YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA
DO FROM NOW ON?

23:53.500 --> 23:54.934
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

23:55.034 --> 23:57.670
ASK PEOPLE IF THEY'RE GAY
BEFORE I HAVE SEX WITH THEM.

23:57.770 --> 24:00.272
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

24:00.372 --> 24:02.174
AND DON'T BE SURPRISED
IF PEOPLE ASK YOU

24:02.274 --> 24:03.776
IF YOU KEEP DRESSING
LIKE THAT.

24:05.177 --> 24:07.279
I'M GONNA HAVE THE LAST WORD
IN THIS SITUATION.

24:07.379 --> 24:09.081
- IT WAS NICE TO SEE YOU.
- NO.

24:09.181 --> 24:11.484
- YOUR DAD IS GAY.
- NO.

24:15.354 --> 24:17.757
- 53.
- ( laughs ) OH, MY GOD!

24:17.857 --> 24:19.859
- 54. 54. I'M SORRY.
- NO. STOP. NO.

24:19.959 --> 24:22.094
- PEOPLE TELL YOU
YOU'RE GOOD AT THAT?
- ALL THE TIME.

24:22.194 --> 24:24.263
'CAUSE YOU'RE BAD AT THAT.
YOU'RE VERY BAD AT THAT.

24:24.363 --> 24:26.933
- YOU'RE NOT GOOD AT THAT.
- YOU KNOW WHAT-- I WAS
PROBABLY PICKING UP

24:27.033 --> 24:29.235
ON YOUR SPIRIT,
WHICH FEELS 53.

24:29.335 --> 24:34.340
- OH, MY GOD, THAT IS
SO MUCH WORSE.
- ( laughs )

24:34.440 --> 24:36.509
WHAT'S YOUR JOB?

24:36.609 --> 24:38.410
HAS ANYBODY EVER TOLD YOU
THAT'S NOT A POLITE QUESTION?

24:38.511 --> 24:40.279
NO.

24:40.379 --> 24:42.314
DO YOU THINK THAT MAYBE

24:42.414 --> 24:45.017
THAT'S BECAUSE
THE ANSWER'S BORING?

24:45.117 --> 24:50.957
OR IT ALSO COULD BE
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB.

24:52.024 --> 24:54.326
DO YOU NOT--
DO YOU NOT HAVE A JOB?

24:54.426 --> 24:56.062
IT'S OKAY.
I DON'T HAVE A JOB.

24:56.162 --> 24:58.698
I NEVER HAD A--
I MEAN, I DIDN'T HAVE
A JOB UNTIL TODAY.

24:58.798 --> 25:00.399
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

25:00.499 --> 25:03.670
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITH THE REST OF YOUR LIFE?

25:03.770 --> 25:06.906
DIDN'T ANYONE EVER TELL YOU
THAT'S A RUDE QUESTION?

25:07.006 --> 25:09.075
( both laughing )

25:09.175 --> 25:11.177
- DADDY?
- HMM? OH.

25:11.277 --> 25:13.245
HEY, BEA.
HOW ARE YOU?

25:13.345 --> 25:14.781
WHAT'S UP?
DID WE WAKE YOU UP?

25:14.881 --> 25:17.650
- WITH YOUR TALKING.
- OH, I'M SORRY, SWEETHEART.

25:17.750 --> 25:21.287
- I WAS JUST GONNA PAY...
- JESSA?

25:21.387 --> 25:22.889
YEAH, I KNOW.
I KNOW, LADY.

25:22.989 --> 25:24.490
- LET ME GET MY WALLET.
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

25:24.591 --> 25:26.358
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

25:26.458 --> 25:28.728
PAY ME TOMORROW.
IT'S FINE. FINE.

25:28.828 --> 25:30.529
- DADDY?
- YEAH, BABY?

25:30.630 --> 25:33.800
WHY ARE YOU EATING
MY SCHOOL SNACK?

25:33.900 --> 25:37.203
UM, 'CAUSE SOMETIMES
DADDIES NEED A SNACK.

25:37.303 --> 25:40.640
BUT YOU'RE NOT
IN NIGHT SCHOOL.

25:40.740 --> 25:42.041
- ( music playing )
- ( keyboard clicking )

25:42.141 --> 25:46.713
* I knew I was sad

25:49.315 --> 25:53.586
* I recognized it was bad

25:56.455 --> 26:00.192
* But now looking back

26:00.292 --> 26:05.397
* I see my mind

26:05.497 --> 26:08.434
* It was cracked--

26:08.534 --> 26:11.237
- ( clicks )
- ( new song begins )

26:11.337 --> 26:14.707
( keyboard clicking )

26:26.585 --> 26:32.024
* SOMEBODY SAID
YOU GOT A NEW FRIEND *

26:35.394 --> 26:38.798
* DOES SHE LOVE YOU
BETTER THAN I CAN? *

26:44.036 --> 26:46.906
( muffled music playing )

26:51.577 --> 26:53.780
- ( music blaring )
- * I'm giving it my all...

26:53.880 --> 26:58.617
- HANNAH?
- * But I'm not the girl
you're taking home *

26:58.718 --> 27:00.753
* Ooh ooh ooh

27:00.853 --> 27:04.757
* I keep dancing on my own

27:04.857 --> 27:08.627
* I keep dancing
on my own *

27:08.728 --> 27:13.299
* I'm just gonna
dance all night... *

27:17.937 --> 27:21.440
- YO, GIRL.
- YO, GIRL.

27:21.540 --> 27:23.609
WHAT'S UP?
OH, MY GOD, ELIJAH'S GAY.

27:23.710 --> 27:26.345
- WHAT?
- YES.

27:26.445 --> 27:28.080
OH, MY GOD.
THAT IS FUNNY.

27:28.180 --> 27:30.883
FUNNY IS ONE WORD FOR IT.
I WAS GONNA GO WITH
FUCKED OR SAD.

27:30.983 --> 27:32.919
BUT, I MEAN, I PROBABLY
SHOULD HAVE SUSPECTED

27:33.019 --> 27:35.487
BECAUSE HE ONLY EJACULATED
LIKE 30% OF THE TIME.

27:35.587 --> 27:37.323
AND HE SEEMED GAY.

27:37.423 --> 27:39.692
YEAH, HE-- HE SEEMED GAY.

27:39.792 --> 27:41.560
HE SEEMED GAY.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.896
- YEAH, HE WAS GAY.
- ( both laughing )

27:43.996 --> 27:46.032
* Why can't you see me?

27:46.132 --> 27:48.400
* Oh

27:49.635 --> 27:51.670
* I'm giving it my all

27:51.771 --> 27:56.142
* But I'm not the girl
you're taking home *

27:56.242 --> 27:57.944
* Ooh ooh ooh

27:58.044 --> 28:02.448
* I keep dancing on my own

28:02.548 --> 28:06.719
* I keep dancing
on my own *

28:22.601 --> 28:26.672
* SO FAR AWAY,
BUT STILL SO NEAR *

28:26.773 --> 28:30.777
* THE LIGHTS GO ON,
THE MUSIC DIES *

28:30.877 --> 28:35.147
* BUT YOU DON'T SEE ME
STANDING HERE *

28:35.247 --> 28:39.218
* I JUST CAME
TO SAY GOODBYE *

28:39.318 --> 28:43.355
* I'M IN THE CORNER
WATCHING YOU KISS HER *

28:43.455 --> 28:47.259
* OH OH OH

28:47.359 --> 28:49.161
* I'M GIVING IT MY ALL

28:49.261 --> 28:53.565
* BUT I'M NOT THE GIRL
YOU'RE TAKING HOME *

28:53.665 --> 28:55.667
* OOH OOH OOH

28:55.768 --> 28:59.338
* I KEEP DANCING ON MY OWN

28:59.438 --> 29:05.077
- * I KEEP DANCING
ON MY OWN *
- * OH, YEAH

29:16.122 --> 29:20.927
* I KEEP DANCING
ON MY OWN. *
