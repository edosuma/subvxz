‐ Yeah.

01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:05.577
‐ You're looking at the
newest fifth grade teacher

01:26:05.577 --> 01:26:06.953

‐ What?

01:26:09.831 --> 01:26:13.543

01:26:30.727 --> 01:26:32.229
because I know I'm not alone.

01:26:34.815 --> 01:26:38.151
‐ It takes a village.

01:26:38.151 --> 01:26:40.070
‐ It takes a tribe.
