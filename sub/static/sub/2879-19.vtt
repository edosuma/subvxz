WEBVTT

00:04.227 --> 00:05.511
What you doing?

00:05.513 --> 00:06.645
You said clean up.

00:06.647 --> 00:08.847
I'm cleaning up.

00:10.016 --> 00:11.883
You can't just throw
everything in the closet.

00:11.885 --> 00:13.102
Hey, you can tell me

00:13.104 --> 00:15.821
what to do
or you can tell me how to do it,

00:15.823 --> 00:19.158
but you can't do both;
this isn't sex.

00:20.744 --> 00:22.745
What if someone looks in there?

00:22.747 --> 00:24.279
They're just coming
over for dinner.

00:24.281 --> 00:25.864
No one's gonna
look in the closet.

00:25.866 --> 00:26.999
Well, you don't know that.

00:27.001 --> 00:28.283
What if someone's
looking for the bathroom

00:28.285 --> 00:29.334
and they open that door?

00:29.336 --> 00:30.536
Could work out.

00:30.538 --> 00:31.770
For all we know,

00:31.772 --> 00:33.639
there's a toilet
in there somewhere.

00:33.641 --> 00:35.591
Fine. But after tonight,

00:35.593 --> 00:37.593
we need to get a handle
on this mess.

00:37.595 --> 00:38.711
You know what we should do?

00:38.713 --> 00:39.950
We should show the
closet to Sheldon.

00:39.975 --> 00:40.680
Why?

00:40.681 --> 00:41.880
Are you kidding?

00:41.882 --> 00:43.849
He's like a savant
at organizing.

00:43.851 --> 00:46.018
Everything in his apartment
has a label on it.

00:46.020 --> 00:48.053
Including his label maker,
which has a label

00:48.055 --> 00:49.555
that says "Label Maker."

00:51.274 --> 00:53.308
And if you look really close
at that label maker label,

00:53.310 --> 00:56.428
you'll see a label
that says "Label."

00:56.430 --> 00:58.597
He's our guest;
we can't just ask him

00:58.599 --> 00:59.948
to straighten our closet.

00:59.950 --> 01:02.100
No, we wouldn't ask him.

01:02.102 --> 01:04.620
We'd just show him the closet

01:04.622 --> 01:07.573
and let the goblins in his head
take it from there.

01:08.775 --> 01:10.576
Hey, guys, come on in.

01:10.578 --> 01:11.794
Hi.
Hi.

01:11.796 --> 01:14.296
Ooh, it smells good.
Thanks.

01:14.298 --> 01:16.665
And, Sheldon, I know tonight's
the night you eat Thai food,

01:16.667 --> 01:18.751
so I went to the Asian market,
got all the ingredients

01:18.753 --> 01:19.802
and made it from scratch.

01:19.804 --> 01:21.837
Oh, you shouldn't have.

01:21.839 --> 01:23.338
Oh, it's my pleasure.

01:23.340 --> 01:25.307
No, you really shouldn't have.

01:25.309 --> 01:27.726
I brought my own.

01:27.728 --> 01:30.312
You stopped
and got him takeout?

01:30.314 --> 01:31.313
I had no choice.

01:31.315 --> 01:33.799
He kept kicking
the back of my seat.

01:33.801 --> 01:36.018
Sheldon, I've been
cooking all day.

01:36.020 --> 01:38.737
Well... now don't you
feel silly.

01:40.774 --> 01:42.808
Show him the closet.

02:13.288 --> 02:15.940
These spring rolls are amazing.

02:15.942 --> 02:17.158
Good job, Bernadette.

02:17.160 --> 02:20.294
That's the takeout
that Sheldon brought.

02:22.364 --> 02:25.166
Oh, well, I'm sure
they wouldn't have tasted

02:25.168 --> 02:27.818
nearly as good if I hadn't tried
your food first.

02:31.690 --> 02:34.542
Howard, did you want
your clothes arranged

02:34.544 --> 02:36.327
seasonally or by color?

02:36.329 --> 02:37.462
Color's fine.

02:37.464 --> 02:39.430
Wrong, they'll be
arranged seasonally.

02:41.016 --> 02:43.217
Sheldon, aren't you gonna spend
a little time with Amy?

02:43.219 --> 02:44.685
Oh, it's okay, I'm used to it.

02:44.687 --> 02:46.837
The other day at Whole Foods,
he spent an hour

02:46.839 --> 02:49.307
optimizing the cheese aisle.

02:49.309 --> 02:50.525
Yeah, and some thanks I got.

02:50.527 --> 02:52.343
The assistant manager
chased me out

02:52.345 --> 02:54.345
with an artisanal salami.

02:55.647 --> 02:58.849
His quirks
just make you love him more.

03:00.536 --> 03:02.520
Someone please agree with me.

03:08.076 --> 03:09.127
Sheldon, come on.

03:09.129 --> 03:10.461
It's getting late.
Time to go.

03:10.463 --> 03:13.381
Oh, five more minutes.

03:13.383 --> 03:15.416
That's what you said
five minutes ago.

03:15.418 --> 03:17.135
Amy and Penny
are already in the car.

03:17.137 --> 03:18.252
Let's move it.

03:18.254 --> 03:21.672
How come I never get to do
anything I want to do?

03:21.674 --> 03:23.641
You know, if he really wants
to stay and finish,

03:23.643 --> 03:25.042
I can give him
a ride home.

03:25.044 --> 03:28.095
Please, Leonard!
He said it's okay!

03:28.097 --> 03:29.147
Sheldon, it's--

03:29.149 --> 03:31.549
Wait, I can go home
without you? Bye!

03:33.602 --> 03:36.270
Howard, I have
a few questions.

03:36.272 --> 03:38.906
I found three
bowling pins.

03:38.908 --> 03:43.394
Now, do you juggle these,
or are you missing seven?

03:43.396 --> 03:44.745
Juggle.

03:44.747 --> 03:46.697
You health nuts kill me.

03:50.903 --> 03:53.621
Oh, my God,
it's beautiful!

03:53.623 --> 03:56.457
Look, he found the
juggling pins I hid.

03:56.459 --> 03:58.593
Uh, just a couple
more items.

03:58.595 --> 04:01.012
Howard, I found this letter
from your dad in a box.

04:01.014 --> 04:02.296
Now, based on
the content,

04:02.298 --> 04:04.248
it could either be filed...

04:04.250 --> 04:05.766
Whoa, you opened this?

04:05.768 --> 04:07.718
Well, I had to find out if
it was personal correspondence

04:07.720 --> 04:09.587
or memorabilia.
Now, as I was saying,

04:09.589 --> 04:11.922
based on the content...
I couldn't be less interested.

04:13.826 --> 04:16.360
Now, come on,
I'll take you home.

04:16.362 --> 04:18.029
Howard, don't you want to
know what's in the letter?

04:18.031 --> 04:20.231
If I wanted to know,
I would've opened it years ago.

04:21.099 --> 04:22.984
The closet looks great.

04:22.986 --> 04:24.318
Let's get out of here.

04:24.320 --> 04:25.953
Wait, can I
bring this box

04:25.955 --> 04:28.573
of extra shirt buttons
to sort on the ride?

04:28.575 --> 04:31.492
Do whatever you want.

04:31.494 --> 04:32.943
Thanks.

04:33.745 --> 04:34.745
Oh.

04:34.747 --> 04:36.297
Great party.

04:40.719 --> 04:42.169
You know, when I
first met Howard,

04:42.171 --> 04:44.171
he would pull his scrotum
out of his shorts

04:44.173 --> 04:46.457
and say, "Oh,
I sat in gum."

04:51.563 --> 04:53.548
What is your point?

04:53.550 --> 04:55.850
Well, it's just kind of weird
how grown up he is now.

04:55.852 --> 04:58.069
Happily married guy
throwing dinner parties.

04:58.071 --> 04:59.654
Really? You couldn't
just say that?

04:59.656 --> 05:01.856
You had to tell
the scrotum story?

05:03.775 --> 05:06.277
Trying to paint a picture.

05:07.112 --> 05:09.497
Yeah, it was
a nice change of pace

05:09.499 --> 05:11.482
not eating takeout
around a coffee table.

05:11.484 --> 05:14.151
Mm, you know, we could
throw a dinner party, too.

05:14.153 --> 05:16.254
Maybe even ask everyone
to get dressed up.

05:16.256 --> 05:17.204
Sure.

05:17.206 --> 05:18.706
Just, when you say
"dressed up,"

05:18.708 --> 05:19.990
you mean
nice clothes, right?

05:19.992 --> 05:21.876
Not, like, capes
and tights and crap?

05:23.679 --> 05:25.596
Yeah.

05:25.598 --> 05:26.764
Although...

05:26.766 --> 05:28.299
No!

05:34.673 --> 05:36.173
Howie, you okay?

05:36.175 --> 05:39.393
Yeah, I just...
couldn't sleep.

05:39.395 --> 05:41.646
Told you you shouldn't
have espresso after dinner.

05:41.648 --> 05:44.098
I know the little cups
make you feel big,

05:44.100 --> 05:46.651
but it's not worth it.

05:48.570 --> 05:50.071
It's this stupid letter.

05:50.073 --> 05:51.489
Did you read it?

05:51.491 --> 05:53.040
No.

05:53.042 --> 05:54.792
You must be curious.

05:54.794 --> 05:56.210
Of course I'm curious.

05:56.212 --> 05:58.663
I haven't seen
the man since,

05:58.665 --> 06:00.748
oh, I was a little kid.

06:00.750 --> 06:03.584
And a letter shows up
on my 18th birthday?

06:03.586 --> 06:05.386
What's that about?

06:05.388 --> 06:06.870
Why don't you read it?

06:06.872 --> 06:10.057
Maybe he apologizes or
explains why he left.

06:10.059 --> 06:12.009
He abandoned
me and my mother.

06:12.011 --> 06:16.880
Why does he deserve
a chance to explain anything?

06:16.882 --> 06:19.016
I get that.

06:19.018 --> 06:21.402
So, what do you
want to do with it?

06:21.404 --> 06:24.772
Something I should've done
a long time ago.

06:27.576 --> 06:29.276
Really? Are you sure?

06:29.278 --> 06:31.495
Yep.

06:38.788 --> 06:40.121
Feel better?

06:40.123 --> 06:41.922
I do.

06:45.777 --> 06:46.927
Great.

06:46.929 --> 06:50.247
Neither one of us is
tall enough to reach that.

06:55.887 --> 06:58.639
I can't believe
he set it on fire.

06:58.641 --> 07:01.475
Yeah, just seeing that letter
really freaked him out.

07:01.477 --> 07:03.527
And he was already
having a tough day

07:03.529 --> 07:06.697
'cause he accidentally wore
my pants to work.

07:11.203 --> 07:12.870
I don't know why <i>he</i> was upset.

07:12.872 --> 07:15.272
They were bigger on him than me.

07:17.542 --> 07:19.193
Boy, I'm really curious
what's in that letter.

07:19.195 --> 07:21.579
Me, too, but I guess
now we'll never know.

07:21.581 --> 07:22.913
Well, you said Sheldon read it.

07:22.915 --> 07:24.048
Why not ask him?

07:24.050 --> 07:25.082
I can't do that.

07:25.084 --> 07:26.550
What kind of wife would I be

07:26.552 --> 07:28.252
if I didn't respect
my husband's privacy?

07:28.254 --> 07:29.286
What if I ask Sheldon,

07:29.288 --> 07:30.755
you just happen to be
in the room?

07:30.757 --> 07:32.640
That works.
Okay.

07:34.000 --> 07:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:53.612 --> 07:55.229
Blech.

07:57.315 --> 08:00.484
Like cleaning out the entire
building's belly button.

08:02.320 --> 08:04.505
Hey, Sheldon.

08:04.507 --> 08:06.624
Oh, hello.
What can I do for you ladies?

08:06.626 --> 08:08.793
You have
something we want.

08:08.795 --> 08:10.994
Oh, dear.

08:10.996 --> 08:12.346
My mother warned me

08:12.348 --> 08:15.766
this is what happens
to pretty boys in the big city.

08:15.768 --> 08:18.853
No, we just
want information.

08:18.855 --> 08:19.904
Oh.

08:19.906 --> 08:21.355
Oh, I've got that in spades.

08:21.357 --> 08:22.857
Ravage me.

08:24.142 --> 08:26.610
We heard you read the letter
from Howard's father.

08:26.612 --> 08:27.645
I did.

08:27.647 --> 08:28.579
What did it say?

08:28.581 --> 08:29.563
Yeah...

08:29.565 --> 08:31.148
I can't tell you that.

08:31.150 --> 08:35.184
I'm bound by closet organizer/
organizee confidentiality.

08:36.621 --> 08:38.522
Sheldon, that's
not a real thing.

08:38.524 --> 08:40.374
Well, neither is the rule
that you have to

08:40.376 --> 08:41.909
hold your girlfriend's hand
at the movies.

08:41.910 --> 08:43.360
You know.

08:43.361 --> 08:45.246
That doesn't stop you
from pawing at me

08:45.248 --> 08:48.165
like you're a bear and I'm
a trash can full of sweets.

08:50.201 --> 08:52.035
Why do you even care?

08:52.037 --> 08:53.337
Just tell us what it says.

08:53.339 --> 08:55.806
Control over the information
contained in that letter

08:55.808 --> 08:56.841
belongs to Howard.

08:56.843 --> 08:58.275
By happenstance,

08:58.277 --> 08:59.760
I came to know it.

08:59.762 --> 09:02.212
That doesn't give me the right
to disseminate it freely.

09:02.214 --> 09:04.398
Come on. Look, the letter was
found in Bernadette's closet.

09:04.400 --> 09:05.850
Doesn't that count
for something?

09:07.602 --> 09:09.687
Are you pointing out
that California

09:09.689 --> 09:11.155
is a community property state,

09:11.157 --> 09:13.440
and since Howard and Bernadette
are married,

09:13.442 --> 09:15.659
the intellectual property
contained in that letter

09:15.661 --> 09:17.695
is jointly owned
by the two spouses?

09:23.535 --> 09:26.036
Yeah, obviously.

09:26.038 --> 09:28.706
Well played.

09:30.375 --> 09:33.594
Sometimes I don't give you
enough credit, Penny.

09:34.763 --> 09:36.630
Dude, you made
the right choice

09:36.632 --> 09:38.499
coming to me for help
with this party.

09:38.501 --> 09:41.418
Actually, all I did
was invite you.

09:41.420 --> 09:44.388
Well, put your mind at ease.

09:44.390 --> 09:46.273
I'm here to make sure
your dinner party

09:46.275 --> 09:48.058
kicks Howard's
dinner party's ass.

09:48.060 --> 09:49.259
Now, the first thing

09:49.261 --> 09:51.228
we need is a theme.

09:51.230 --> 09:52.730
I'm thinking...

09:52.732 --> 09:55.232
ah, turn-of-the-century
Moulin Rouge.

09:56.985 --> 10:01.455
I'm thinking you need
a testosterone patch.

10:01.457 --> 10:03.090
Penny and I

10:03.092 --> 10:04.658
just want to do
something low-key.

10:04.660 --> 10:06.126
You know, cocktails,

10:06.128 --> 10:07.711
light jazz music,
hors d'oeuvres.

10:07.713 --> 10:11.031
So your theme is
"I saw a rerun of <i>Mad Men</i>

10:11.033 --> 10:14.401
and bought some crab puffs
from Trader Joe's"?

10:15.804 --> 10:17.638
Hate to miss that.

10:18.890 --> 10:20.758
Hey, where have you been?

10:20.760 --> 10:23.510
Oh, Leonard.

10:23.512 --> 10:25.596
If I was prone to sarcasm,

10:25.598 --> 10:27.765
I'd say I was pulling off
a major heist

10:27.767 --> 10:30.768
at the museum
of laundry baskets.

10:30.770 --> 10:33.520
One, two, three, four, five,

10:33.522 --> 10:35.739
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

10:37.159 --> 10:40.244
I meant, "Golly, Sheldon,
you've been gone a long time."

10:40.246 --> 10:44.481
Oh. Yeah, well, I was waylaid
by Penny, Bernadette and Amy.

10:44.483 --> 10:46.617
They made me reveal
confidential information

10:46.619 --> 10:48.151
about Howard's father.

10:48.153 --> 10:49.319
What information?

10:49.321 --> 10:51.205
I can't tell you that.

10:51.207 --> 10:55.542
I am bound by closet organizer/
organizee confidentiality.

10:55.544 --> 10:57.878
Well, come on,
we won't tell anyone.

10:57.880 --> 10:59.329
Sorry, badgering me won't work.

10:59.331 --> 11:00.831
What you should have said is,

11:00.833 --> 11:02.299
"It's pointless
to keep this a secret

11:02.301 --> 11:03.517
because Penny will tell us."

11:03.519 --> 11:07.021
Fine, then that.
All right, I'll tell you.

11:07.023 --> 11:10.524
My goodness,
everyone's on their game today.

11:18.389 --> 11:20.440
This is really fun.

11:20.442 --> 11:22.892
Yeah, it's nice to get
dressed up once in a while.

11:22.894 --> 11:24.578
Yeah, and hors d'oeuvres
are delightful.

11:24.580 --> 11:26.780
As is the company.
Aw.

11:26.782 --> 11:29.616
My shirt is itchy
and I wish I were dead.

11:31.969 --> 11:34.004
Hey, uh, listen,
everybody.

11:34.006 --> 11:35.622
Before Howard gets here,
let's all just agree

11:35.624 --> 11:37.457
to not bring up the letter
from his father.

11:37.459 --> 11:38.675
Of course.
Sure. Absolutely.

11:38.677 --> 11:40.126
If I say yes,

11:40.128 --> 11:42.879
can we turn off
that Latin orgy music?

11:43.764 --> 11:45.632
Ridiculous that we
still have to walk

11:45.634 --> 11:47.551
up all these
flights of stairs.

11:47.553 --> 11:50.187
Yeah, try doing it
in heels.

11:50.189 --> 11:52.889
I am.

11:53.757 --> 11:55.809
Wait.

11:55.811 --> 11:57.427
There's something
I have to tell you.

11:57.429 --> 11:58.528
What?

11:58.530 --> 12:01.281
I know what was
in your dad's letter.

12:05.269 --> 12:07.654
Sheldon, I swear to God,
I'm gonna kill you!

12:07.656 --> 12:09.523
Hey!

12:11.242 --> 12:12.659
I made him tell us.

12:12.661 --> 12:13.910
What? "Us"?

12:13.912 --> 12:15.245
Who else knows?

12:15.247 --> 12:16.546
I know.
Me, too.

12:16.548 --> 12:17.747
Same here.

12:17.749 --> 12:20.083
Shame on all of you.

12:20.085 --> 12:22.135
You know, too.

12:22.137 --> 12:25.088
Couldn't leave him
with one friend, could you?

12:25.806 --> 12:27.057
So everybody knows

12:27.059 --> 12:28.758
what's in that letter
except for me?

12:28.760 --> 12:30.010
Yes, it's six
against one.

12:30.012 --> 12:32.062
Stand down, sir.

12:32.064 --> 12:34.564
How could you do this?

12:34.566 --> 12:36.016
I'm sorry.

12:36.018 --> 12:37.967
If you want, we
could tell you.

12:37.969 --> 12:40.020
No, I don't
want to know!

12:40.022 --> 12:41.688
I mean,

12:41.690 --> 12:43.240
I do, but...

12:43.242 --> 12:44.941
I got to go.

12:49.146 --> 12:52.749
Used me as a human shield?

12:52.751 --> 12:54.584
I panicked.

12:54.586 --> 12:56.786
He looked taller than usual.

13:00.775 --> 13:02.492
Howard?

13:02.494 --> 13:04.661
In here.

13:06.514 --> 13:07.881
I'm sorry.

13:07.883 --> 13:09.849
I should have left it alone.

13:09.851 --> 13:11.468
It's okay.

13:11.470 --> 13:13.386
Sorry I ran off like that.

13:13.388 --> 13:16.539
What are you looking at?

13:16.541 --> 13:19.109
Uh, pictures of my dad and me
when I was a kid.

13:19.111 --> 13:20.527
That's nice.
I got to tell you,

13:20.529 --> 13:23.563
as angry as I am
at Sheldon for blabbing,

13:23.565 --> 13:26.983
he did a hell of a job
organizing this closet.

13:26.985 --> 13:29.536
Look at this.

13:29.538 --> 13:33.540
"Photos of Wolowitz family
before father left forever."

13:36.544 --> 13:40.547
Check out nine-year-old Howie
with cornrows.

13:42.416 --> 13:46.820
Neither race was happy
to see me with those.

13:49.056 --> 13:50.473
Think you could take a break?

13:50.475 --> 13:51.474
Why?

13:51.476 --> 13:52.976
Got a little surprise for you.

13:52.978 --> 13:54.544
Come on.

13:54.546 --> 13:57.480
Oh, honey...

13:57.482 --> 14:00.049
I am in no mood
to have sex tonight.

14:02.820 --> 14:04.337
I'll lay there
if you absolutely

14:04.339 --> 14:07.023
have to have it, but... Oh.

14:07.842 --> 14:10.360
What are you guys doing here?

14:10.362 --> 14:12.195
When you left,
you weren't sure whether or not

14:12.197 --> 14:14.080
you wanted to know
what was in your dad's letter,

14:14.082 --> 14:16.833
so we came up with
kind of a cool solution.

14:16.835 --> 14:18.618
Oh, yeah, what's that?

14:18.620 --> 14:19.902
It's simple, really.

14:19.904 --> 14:23.206
It occurred to me
that knowing and not knowing

14:23.208 --> 14:26.710
can be achieved by creating
a macroscopic example

14:26.712 --> 14:28.461
of quantum superposition.

14:28.463 --> 14:29.629
The-the principle

14:29.631 --> 14:31.047
that a physical system

14:31.049 --> 14:35.018
exists partially in all
its possible states at once.

14:35.020 --> 14:36.803
We were all thinking it, really.

14:37.921 --> 14:41.725
It was kind of the elephant
in the room, so...

14:42.693 --> 14:45.895
Anyway, um, I realize

14:45.897 --> 14:48.481
if we each present you
with an account

14:48.483 --> 14:50.483
of what your father wrote
to you,

14:50.485 --> 14:52.068
only one of which is true,

14:52.070 --> 14:53.486
and then we don't tell you

14:53.488 --> 14:55.938
which one it is,
you will forever be

14:55.940 --> 14:58.458
in a state
of epistemic ambivalence.

14:58.460 --> 14:59.542
Yeah.

14:59.544 --> 15:01.161
And I said
if it wasn't epistemic,

15:01.163 --> 15:03.546
we might as well not do it.

15:05.216 --> 15:06.833
Sit down, honey.

15:08.219 --> 15:09.402
Raj, you're up.

15:09.404 --> 15:10.970
Okay, um...

15:10.972 --> 15:14.391
It was a card
for your 18th birthday.

15:14.393 --> 15:15.842
Inside it said,

15:15.844 --> 15:17.510
"Happy birthday, Howard.

15:17.512 --> 15:19.629
I love you. Dad."

15:19.631 --> 15:21.481
Oh, and it was

15:21.483 --> 15:23.800
a Far Side card,
the one where the frog

15:23.802 --> 15:27.437
has its tongue stuck
to the underside of an airplane.

15:27.439 --> 15:28.938
Thinks it's a fly.

15:28.940 --> 15:31.641
Silly frog.

15:31.643 --> 15:33.777
So funny.

15:34.812 --> 15:36.446
Sheldon.

15:37.866 --> 15:41.701
It was a map leading
to the lost treasure

15:41.703 --> 15:45.038
of famous pirate One-Eyed Willy.

15:46.590 --> 15:47.841
Nice try.

15:47.843 --> 15:49.926
That's the plot for <i>Goonies.</i>

15:49.928 --> 15:51.327
Told you.

15:51.329 --> 15:53.513
Don't.

15:53.515 --> 15:54.764
Amy.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.601
You didn't know it,

15:58.603 --> 16:00.970
but your father was
in the auditorium

16:00.972 --> 16:02.856
at your high school graduation.

16:02.858 --> 16:05.892
And he cried
because he was so proud of you.

16:05.894 --> 16:08.311
Really?

16:08.313 --> 16:10.113
Or that's complete poppycock
which Amy made up.

16:10.115 --> 16:11.815
It still could be the map.

16:13.400 --> 16:16.202
Penny.

16:16.204 --> 16:18.288
It was a letter explaining

16:18.290 --> 16:20.073
that your dad wasn't
who he said he was.

16:20.075 --> 16:22.158
Eventually, his other life
caught up to him,

16:22.160 --> 16:25.528
and the only way to keep you
and your mom safe was to leave.

16:25.530 --> 16:27.797
I would like
to change mine.

16:30.050 --> 16:34.087
The pirate's name
was Peg-Leg Antoine.

16:35.890 --> 16:38.975
Now it's completely different
from <i>Goonies.</i>

16:38.977 --> 16:40.844
No, it's not.

16:40.846 --> 16:43.096
Don't.

16:43.098 --> 16:44.547
Okay, my turn.

16:44.549 --> 16:48.485
Your dad wrote about how family
is the most important thing,

16:48.487 --> 16:51.688
and that you should never
throw it away like he did.

16:51.690 --> 16:53.773
Hmm.

16:53.775 --> 16:56.442
Bernadette.

16:56.444 --> 16:59.329
Inside the envelope
was a picture

16:59.331 --> 17:01.581
of your dad holding you
the day you were born.

17:01.583 --> 17:03.867
On the back he wrote,

17:03.869 --> 17:07.670
"Howard, my son,
my greatest gift."

17:15.796 --> 17:17.513
You okay?

17:17.516 --> 17:19.799
Yeah.

17:19.800 --> 17:22.050
I'm terrific.

17:23.053 --> 17:25.253
So...?

17:27.257 --> 17:30.927
Which one
do you think it is...

17:30.929 --> 17:33.813
matey?

17:35.733 --> 17:37.867
Actually, I don't want to know.

17:37.869 --> 17:39.202
I...

17:39.204 --> 17:41.738
want all of them to be true.

17:41.740 --> 17:43.122
Well, one of them is.

17:43.124 --> 17:45.825
That's pretty cool.

17:45.827 --> 17:47.460
Thank you, guys.

17:47.462 --> 17:49.412
Hey, it's still early.

17:49.414 --> 17:50.947
Why don't we go back
and have that party?

17:50.949 --> 17:52.715
Yeah, cool.
Okay? Good.

17:53.751 --> 17:55.919
You know, surprisingly,

17:55.921 --> 17:57.720
uh, the letter
from your father

17:57.722 --> 17:58.955
wasn't the most
interesting thing

17:58.957 --> 18:00.256
I read in the closet.

18:00.258 --> 18:03.560
Bernadette's diary
has some saucy passages.

18:03.562 --> 18:05.929
Sheldon, don't you dare!

18:05.931 --> 18:07.263
Th-There's nothing
to worry about.

18:07.265 --> 18:09.182
Your secret's safe with me.

18:09.184 --> 18:11.284
That's more like it.

18:12.736 --> 18:14.771
Although copyright law
would allow me to quote snippets

18:14.773 --> 18:17.023
in the context of a review.

18:33.043 --> 18:34.482
Glad you're
feeling better.

18:34.483 --> 18:35.916
Me, too.

18:35.918 --> 18:37.751
If I'd known
we were gonna be dancing,

18:37.753 --> 18:40.304
would have worn my flats.

18:40.306 --> 18:42.756
This turned out
pretty well, huh?

18:42.758 --> 18:44.624
Yeah, I think so.

18:44.626 --> 18:46.060
I agree.

18:46.062 --> 18:49.096
That is, if you've never been to
or heard of a party before.

18:50.482 --> 18:53.167
If you'd let me pierce your
brain with a hot needle

18:53.169 --> 18:56.704
in the right place, you'd
be happy all the time.

18:58.807 --> 19:00.441
Uh, Penny,

19:00.443 --> 19:03.694
I-I have a couple of questions
about your closet.

19:03.696 --> 19:05.479
Is there any reason

19:05.481 --> 19:07.814
you're keeping
this dead goldfish?

19:08.939 --> 19:12.709
Damn, I forgot to feed him.

19:12.711 --> 19:14.961
And that I had him.

19:14.963 --> 19:18.346
Well, now, did you also
have a dog?

19:18.446 --> 19:22.602
Because I found what appears to
be a battery-operated chew toy.

19:22.702 --> 19:24.618
Party's over!
Party's over!
