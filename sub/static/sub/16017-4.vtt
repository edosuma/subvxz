WEBVTT

00:02.544 --> 00:03.671
(June) NEW YORK IS

00:03.712 --> 00:05.673
THE CULTURAL MECCA

00:03.712 --> 00:05.673
OF THE WORLD--

00:05.714 --> 00:08.425
GREAT SHOPPING, THEATER,

00:05.714 --> 00:08.425
RESTAURANTS...

00:08.467 --> 00:10.344
IF YOU HAVE MONEY,

00:08.467 --> 00:10.344
WHICH I DON'T.

00:10.385 --> 00:11.720
I'VE BEEN SURVIVING

00:11.762 --> 00:13.054
ON A SACK OF POTATOES

00:11.762 --> 00:13.054
I FOUND BEHIND A DELI.

00:13.096 --> 00:15.056
I CAN'T EVEN AFFORD

00:13.096 --> 00:15.056
TO PAY RENT THIS MONTH,

00:15.098 --> 00:16.517
NOT LIKE THIS RICH LADY

00:16.558 --> 00:18.519
SITTING HERE

00:16.558 --> 00:18.519
WITH HER FANCY DOG,

00:18.560 --> 00:20.228
EATING GOURMET CRAB CAKES.

00:20.270 --> 00:23.273
IS SHE OFFERING ME

00:20.270 --> 00:23.273
A BITE OF CRAB CAKE?

00:24.692 --> 00:26.067
WHY DID SHE DO THAT?

00:26.109 --> 00:27.361
(woman, haughty voice)

00:26.109 --> 00:27.361
I DON'T KNOW WHY I DID IT,

00:27.402 --> 00:30.113
TOYING WITH THE GIRL'S EMOTIONS

00:27.402 --> 00:30.113
LIKE THAT.

00:30.155 --> 00:31.740
MAYBE I WAS BORED.

00:31.782 --> 00:34.075
MAYBE I WAS LASHING OUT

00:31.782 --> 00:34.075
AT GEOFFREY.

00:34.117 --> 00:37.037
EITHER WAY,

00:34.117 --> 00:37.037
IT WAS SOMETHING TO DO.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.709
OH,  MY GOD!

00:41.750 --> 00:43.084
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?!

00:43.126 --> 00:44.962
OH, I SPILLED MY SOUP

00:43.126 --> 00:44.962
AT LUNCH,

00:45.004 --> 00:46.755
AND THEN A GUY'S HEART

00:45.004 --> 00:46.755
EXPLODED ON ME.

00:46.797 --> 00:48.507
I COULD NEVER BE A NURSE

00:46.797 --> 00:48.507
LIKE YOU.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.676
I'D BE  WAY  TOO EMOTIONAL.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.093
YEAH, WELL,

00:50.718 --> 00:52.093
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE WEAK.

00:52.135 --> 00:53.679
IT TAKES A SPECIAL KIND

00:52.135 --> 00:53.679
OF PERSON--

00:53.721 --> 00:57.098
SOMEONE CALM, COMPOSED,

00:53.721 --> 00:57.098
NOT EASILY RATTLED.

00:57.140 --> 01:01.102
OH, MY GOD! MY MOUSE PAD

00:57.140 --> 01:01.102
WITH CHLOE'S PICTURE ON IT CAME!

01:01.144 --> 01:02.563
YEAH!

01:02.604 --> 01:04.815
♪ MM-MM, MM-MM, MM-MM ♪

01:07.943 --> 01:10.946
(keys jangling)

01:13.156 --> 01:16.493
IT'S FIRST, LAST,

01:13.156 --> 01:16.493
AND SECURITY TO MOVE IN.

01:16.535 --> 01:18.328
IS CASH OKAY?

01:16.535 --> 01:18.328
(door opens)

01:18.370 --> 01:21.331
(door closes)

01:18.370 --> 01:21.331
OH! GOOD!

01:21.373 --> 01:23.291
OUR OTHER ROOMMATE IS

01:21.373 --> 01:23.291
HOME.

01:23.333 --> 01:25.627
JUNE, THIS IS BETHANY.

01:25.669 --> 01:28.589
SHE RESPONDED TO THE ROOMMATE

01:25.669 --> 01:28.589
LISTING THAT WE POSTED.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.841
WHAT ROOM--WHAT ARE YOU...

01:30.883 --> 01:32.300
(whispers) NO. NO!

01:32.342 --> 01:35.596
YOU CANNOT RUN THE ROOMMATE SCAM

01:32.342 --> 01:35.596
AGAIN, CHLOE. IT'S WRONG!

01:35.637 --> 01:38.139
WHAT'S GOING ON?

01:35.637 --> 01:38.139
AM I STILL GONNA MEET DAWSON?

01:38.181 --> 01:40.141
IT'S THE LAST

01:38.181 --> 01:40.141
TIME.

01:38.181 --> 01:40.141
I

01:38.181 --> 01:40.141
SWEAR.

01:40.183 --> 01:42.561
(speaking German)

01:40.183 --> 01:42.561
Good Day!

01:42.603 --> 01:44.980
So good to be home!

01:45.022 --> 01:46.065
(door closes)

01:46.105 --> 01:49.026
Can't wait to take a hot bath...

01:49.068 --> 01:50.193
...and...

01:50.235 --> 01:52.571
...where is all my stuff?

01:52.613 --> 01:55.156
OH! THE GERMAN ROOMMATE.

01:52.613 --> 01:55.156
I FORGOT ABOUT HER.

01:55.198 --> 01:57.158
SHE WAS IN PLAY

01:55.198 --> 01:57.158
WAY BEFORE YOU MOVED IN.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.535
HI, GERTA!

01:57.200 --> 01:58.535
WELCOME.

01:58.577 --> 02:00.996
DID YOU BRING ME

01:58.577 --> 02:00.996

02:16.011 --> 02:17.387
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?

02:17.429 --> 02:19.974
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WERE

02:17.429 --> 02:19.974
TRYING

02:17.429 --> 02:19.974
TO SCAM ANOTHER GIRL.

02:20.015 --> 02:22.183
DO YOU EVEN

02:20.015 --> 02:22.183
KNOW

02:20.015 --> 02:22.183
WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS

02:20.015 --> 02:22.183
WRONG?

02:22.225 --> 02:24.185
HELP.  HELP  ANOTHER GIRL.

02:24.227 --> 02:26.229
AND IT'S NOT WRONG.

02:24.227 --> 02:26.229
IT'S A GRAY AREA.

02:26.271 --> 02:27.481
THERE'S NO SUCH THING

02:26.271 --> 02:27.481
AS A GRAY AREA.

02:27.522 --> 02:29.190
IT'S EITHER RIGHT

02:27.522 --> 02:29.190
OR IT'S WRONG.

02:29.232 --> 02:31.234
NOT TRUE. IF IT HADN'T BEEN ME

02:29.232 --> 02:31.234
STEALING HER MONEY,

02:31.276 --> 02:32.653
IT WOULD'VE BEEN

02:31.276 --> 02:32.653
SOMEBODY

02:31.276 --> 02:32.653
ELSE,

02:32.694 --> 02:34.195
AND THEY PROBABLY WOULD'VE

02:32.694 --> 02:34.195
KILLED HER,

02:32.694 --> 02:34.195
TOO,

02:34.237 --> 02:36.865
SO I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY. YOU JUST

02:34.237 --> 02:36.865
SENT POOR BECKY OFF TO DIE.

02:36.907 --> 02:39.367
BETHANY.

02:36.907 --> 02:39.367
WHATEVER.

02:36.907 --> 02:39.367
EITHER WAY, SHE'S DEAD.

02:39.409 --> 02:40.911
YOU DON'T CARE WHO YOU HURT,

02:39.409 --> 02:40.911
DO YOU?

02:40.953 --> 02:44.205
WHETHER IT'S ROBIN OR BETHANY

02:40.953 --> 02:44.205
OR THAT OLD GERMAN LADY.

02:44.247 --> 02:45.874
SHOCKINGLY, GERTA'S ONLY 25.

02:45.916 --> 02:48.251
GERMAN PEOPLE JUST AGE

02:45.916 --> 02:48.251
SO POORLY.

02:48.293 --> 02:50.838
SO WHAT'S YOUR PLAN TO MAKE UP

02:48.293 --> 02:50.838
MY HALF OF THE

02:48.293 --> 02:50.838
RENT?

02:50.879 --> 02:52.047
OH,  YOUR  HALF?

02:52.089 --> 02:54.215
UH, YEAH. YOU JUST SCARED OFF

02:52.089 --> 02:54.215
THOSE GIRLS.

02:54.257 --> 02:55.383
NOW I HAVE NO WAY TO PAY.

02:55.425 --> 02:56.802
I CAN'T EVEN COVER  MY  HALF.

02:56.844 --> 02:59.013
AND I CAN'T ASK MY PARENTS

02:56.844 --> 02:59.013
FOR HELP.

02:59.054 --> 03:01.306
THEY SPENT ALL THEIR

02:59.054 --> 03:01.306
SAVINGS

02:59.054 --> 03:01.306
PUTTING ME THROUGH GRAD SCHOOL.

03:01.348 --> 03:04.309
We canceled the cable and we're

03:01.348 --> 03:04.309
making our own hair spray.

03:04.351 --> 03:05.811
(static)

03:04.351 --> 03:05.811
We'll be okay,

03:05.853 --> 03:08.313
as long as Grandma Rose

03:05.853 --> 03:08.313
passes soon. (chuckles)

03:08.355 --> 03:09.731
Unfortunately,

03:08.355 --> 03:09.731
she's a fighter,

03:09.773 --> 03:11.232
but, uh, we're prayin'.

03:11.274 --> 03:12.651
We're praying. (chuckles)

03:11.274 --> 03:12.651
Yeah, every

03:11.274 --> 03:12.651
night.

03:12.693 --> 03:16.237
(scoffs) WELL, WHATEVER.

03:12.693 --> 03:16.237
I'LL JUST ASK JAMES.

03:16.279 --> 03:17.405
YEAH. ABSOLUTELY.

03:16.279 --> 03:17.405
NO PROBLEM.

03:17.447 --> 03:18.657
(sighs

03:17.447 --> 03:18.657
WHATEVER YOU NEED.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.534
THANK YOU SO MUCH, JAMES.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.534
THAT'S AWESOME.

03:20.575 --> 03:22.285
JUST TALK TO LUTHER.

03:20.575 --> 03:22.285
HE HANDLES ALL MY FINANCES.

03:22.327 --> 03:23.662
BITCH, PLEASE.

03:23.704 --> 03:24.913
BITCH.

03:24.955 --> 03:26.414
UGH. WHY NOT?

03:26.456 --> 03:30.127
BECAUSE IN THE PAST FOUR

03:26.456 --> 03:30.127
YEARS,

03:26.456 --> 03:30.127
YOU'VE BORROWED...

03:30.169 --> 03:34.173
OVER $20,000 FROM JAMES.

03:34.213 --> 03:36.884
DINNERS, SHOPPING SPREES.

03:36.925 --> 03:40.888
AND I'M NOT EVEN COUNTING

03:36.925 --> 03:40.888
JAMES' STUNT DOUBLE YOU

03:36.925 --> 03:40.888
"LOST."

03:40.929 --> 03:42.723
COME ON, LUTHER.

03:40.929 --> 03:42.723
I NEED THE MONEY.

03:42.764 --> 03:44.641
AND I NEEDED NOTES

03:42.764 --> 03:44.641
ON MY PLAY.

03:44.683 --> 03:47.268
I GAVE IT TO YOU TO READ

03:44.683 --> 03:47.268
OVER A YEAR AGO.

03:47.310 --> 03:48.729
(singsongy) REMEMBER?

03:48.770 --> 03:51.481
SO, AGAIN, MY ANSWER IS...

03:51.523 --> 03:53.067
(imitates Southern accent)

03:51.523 --> 03:53.067
THE GRAPES ON THE VINE

03:53.108 --> 03:55.110
AREN'T HAVING IT.

03:55.152 --> 03:58.321
(normal voice) IF YOU'D READ

03:55.152 --> 03:58.321
MY PLAY, YOU'D GET THAT.

04:00.532 --> 04:01.909
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS FINISHED?

04:01.950 --> 04:03.326
'CAUSE I GOT SOMETHING EXCITING

04:01.950 --> 04:03.326
TO SHOW YOU.

04:03.368 --> 04:04.953
READY? AND...

04:04.995 --> 04:06.872
REVEAL!

04:06.914 --> 04:08.456
NICE.

04:08.498 --> 04:10.667
RIGHT? MY PUBLICIST THOUGHT

04:08.498 --> 04:10.667
I SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE

04:10.709 --> 04:12.502
OF ALL THE PRESS I'M GETTING

04:10.709 --> 04:12.502
FOR "DANCING WITH THE STARS"

04:12.544 --> 04:15.714
AND LAUNCH MY OWN LINE OF JEANS.

04:12.544 --> 04:15.714
SO...

04:15.756 --> 04:16.965
BEEK JEANS.

04:17.007 --> 04:18.299
PUT YOUR CHEEKS IN A BEEK.

04:18.341 --> 04:19.927
(chuckles)

04:19.968 --> 04:21.344
RIGHT?

04:21.386 --> 04:25.015
HOLY MOTHER! DAMN IT, THOSE

04:21.386 --> 04:25.015
ARE

04:21.386 --> 04:25.015
TIGHT! DOESN'T THAT HURT?

04:25.057 --> 04:26.391
SO MUCH. YEAH.

04:26.433 --> 04:27.893
BUT IF YOU WANT YOUR ASS

04:26.433 --> 04:27.893
TO ROCK,

04:27.935 --> 04:29.310
YOUR PLUMS GOTTA PAY THE PRICE.

04:41.740 --> 04:44.367
(laughs) TOPICAL.

04:44.409 --> 04:47.829
OHH. AM I SO SICK

04:44.409 --> 04:47.829
OF WORRYING ABOUT MONEY.

04:47.871 --> 04:49.623

04:47.871 --> 04:49.623
ARE

04:47.871 --> 04:49.623
ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT

04:49.664 --> 04:51.499
MOVING IN TOGETHER

04:49.664 --> 04:51.499
TO SAVE MONEY ON RENT.

04:51.541 --> 04:53.752
BIG STEP! THAT'S EXCITING!

04:53.794 --> 04:55.336
YEAH, IT IS.

04:55.378 --> 04:56.922
SHE'S GOT A LOT OF

04:55.378 --> 04:56.922
DEFINITE

04:55.378 --> 04:56.922
OPINIONS ABOUT THINGS--

04:56.964 --> 05:00.592
MY WARDROBE, MY MUSIC,

04:56.964 --> 05:00.592
THE WAY I EAT EGGS.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.343
I BLOW ON 'EM WHETHER OR NOT

05:00.634 --> 05:02.343
THEY'RE WARM.

05:02.385 --> 05:03.804
IT BOTHERS SOME

05:02.385 --> 05:03.804
PEOPLE.

05:03.845 --> 05:06.723
OOH! I GOTTA RUN.

05:03.845 --> 05:06.723
I GOTTA GET TO CHURCH.

05:06.765 --> 05:07.766
OH, I DIDN'T KNOW

05:06.765 --> 05:07.766
YOU WENT TO

05:06.765 --> 05:07.766
CHURCH.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.518
I USED TO GO EVERY SUNDAY

05:07.808 --> 05:10.518
BACK IN INDIANA.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.229
I REALLY MISSED

05:10.560 --> 05:12.229
THAT SENSE OF COMMUNITY,

05:12.271 --> 05:14.731
SO I FOUND THIS REALLY GREAT

05:12.271 --> 05:14.731
CHURCH RIGHT BY MY APARTMENT.

05:14.773 --> 05:17.067
WOW. I HAVEN'T BEEN TO CHURCH

05:14.773 --> 05:17.067
IN FOREVER.

05:17.109 --> 05:19.360
JENNIFER THINKS

05:17.109 --> 05:19.360
GOD STEALS FOCUS.

05:19.402 --> 05:21.989
YOU MIND IF I TAG ALONG?

05:22.030 --> 05:23.406
(organ playing hymn,

05:22.030 --> 05:23.406
people shouting indistinctly)

05:23.448 --> 05:27.410
(speaking Korean)

05:29.412 --> 05:32.207
(loudly) I WAS RAISED BAPTIST,

05:29.412 --> 05:32.207
SO THIS FEELS LIKE HOME.

05:32.249 --> 05:34.084
(loudly)

05:32.249 --> 05:34.084
WHAT, DO YOU SPEAK KOREAN?

05:34.126 --> 05:36.170
GOD SPEAKS ALL LANGUAGES.

05:36.211 --> 05:38.379
YES,

05:36.211 --> 05:38.379
BUT DO  YOU  SPEAK KOREAN?

05:38.421 --> 05:40.632
(continues speaking Korean)

05:40.674 --> 05:43.218
(speaking Korean)

05:40.674 --> 05:43.218
(coins clink)

05:43.260 --> 05:45.428
THAT WAS A LOVELY SERMON,

05:43.260 --> 05:45.428
PASTOR JIN.

05:45.470 --> 05:48.098
OHH, JUNE,

05:45.470 --> 05:48.098
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

05:48.140 --> 05:50.058
I'M SORRY. I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING

05:48.140 --> 05:50.058
FOR THE COLLECTION PLATE,

05:50.100 --> 05:52.393
BUT I DID BRING YOU SOME

05:50.100 --> 05:52.393
OF MY HOMEMADE JAM.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.393
(gasps)

05:52.435 --> 05:56.397
OHH! DON'T APOLOGIZE.

05:52.435 --> 05:56.397
EVERYONE LOVES YOUR JAM.

05:56.439 --> 05:58.608
NUMBER TWO SELLER AT

05:56.439 --> 05:58.608
THE CHURCH BAZAAR LAST MONTH.

05:58.650 --> 06:01.320
NUMBER ONE WAS

05:58.650 --> 06:01.320
GRACE PARK'S VELVET ELVISES.

06:01.360 --> 06:02.904
(organ swells)

06:02.946 --> 06:04.405
IT'S THE JAM.

06:04.447 --> 06:07.742
THE JAM IS THE ANSWER!

06:10.037 --> 06:12.206
THIS HAS BEEN

06:10.037 --> 06:12.206
A VERY CONFUSING DAY.

06:12.247 --> 06:14.457
HEY. CAN I TOUCH YOUR HAIR?

06:14.499 --> 06:15.458
UH...

06:15.500 --> 06:16.918
OKAY.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.918
YOU LOOK LIKE OBAMA.

06:16.960 --> 06:20.922
(stammers) I-I GOTTA

06:16.960 --> 06:20.922
GO

06:16.960 --> 06:20.922
TO THE BATHROOM.

06:24.467 --> 06:25.468
I HAVE A NEW NEMESIS.

06:25.510 --> 06:27.512
LUTHER HAS JUST REPLACED

06:25.510 --> 06:27.512
CHEAP TEQUILA.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.097
(keys jangle)

06:27.554 --> 06:29.097
I HAD A BRAINSTORM AT CHURCH.

06:29.139 --> 06:30.431
OH, YOU'RE STILL GOING

06:29.139 --> 06:30.431
TO THAT PLACE?

06:30.473 --> 06:31.808
YOU'RE SUCH A GOOD KOREAN.

06:30.473 --> 06:31.808
CHRISTIAN.

06:31.850 --> 06:33.018
WHAT AM I SAYING?

06:33.060 --> 06:34.853
I'M GONNA MAKE

06:33.060 --> 06:34.853
MY HOMEMADE JAM

06:34.895 --> 06:37.480
AND SELL IT

06:34.895 --> 06:37.480
TO COVER MY RENT.

06:37.522 --> 06:38.690
BOO. HORRIBLE

06:37.522 --> 06:38.690
IDEA.

06:38.732 --> 06:42.069
NO, IT'S NOT.

06:38.732 --> 06:42.069
NO ONE CAN RESIST MY JAM.

06:42.110 --> 06:44.279
HERE. TRY IT.

06:42.110 --> 06:44.279
BE CAREFUL, THOUGH.

06:44.321 --> 06:45.446
IT'S REALLY HOT.

06:45.488 --> 06:46.698
(blows

06:45.488 --> 06:46.698
air)

06:48.075 --> 06:50.451
WOW. THIS IS AMAZING,

06:48.075 --> 06:50.451
JUNE.

06:50.493 --> 06:52.453
REALLY?

06:50.493 --> 06:52.453
I CAN TOTALLY SELL THIS.

06:52.495 --> 06:54.289
WE CAN TEAM UP

06:52.495 --> 06:54.289
TO MAKE THE RENT.

06:54.331 --> 06:56.541
TOGETHER,

06:54.331 --> 06:56.541
WE'RE TWICE AS STRONG.

07:37.582 --> 07:39.334
I'M STORING THE JAM

07:37.582 --> 07:39.334
BECAUSE CHLOE AND I ARE--

07:39.376 --> 07:40.501
THAT'S...

07:39.376 --> 07:40.501

07:41.544 --> 07:42.921
CHLOE! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:42.963 --> 07:44.131
I THOUGHT THAT YOU

07:42.963 --> 07:44.131
WERE

07:42.963 --> 07:44.131
SELLING

07:42.963 --> 07:44.131
THEM

07:44.172 --> 07:46.674
TO ARTISAN SHOPS

07:44.172 --> 07:46.674
AND FARMERS MARKETS.

07:46.716 --> 07:48.343
(knocking on

07:46.716 --> 07:48.343
door)

07:46.716 --> 07:48.343
WELL, NOT

07:46.716 --> 07:48.343
EXACTLY.

07:48.385 --> 07:49.594
BUT DON'T WORRY.

07:48.385 --> 07:49.594
WE'RE STILL MAKING MONEY.

07:48.385 --> 07:49.594
COME ON!

07:49.636 --> 07:51.346
HOW?

07:49.636 --> 07:51.346
(rattling continues)

07:51.388 --> 07:52.513
OKAY, DON'T BE MAD.

07:52.555 --> 07:53.514
(June,

07:52.555 --> 07:53.514
haltingly)

07:52.555 --> 07:53.514
NO ONE CAN

07:52.555 --> 07:53.514
RESIST

07:53.556 --> 07:55.516
MY HOT, HOT JAM.

07:55.558 --> 07:58.519
NO ONE CAN

07:55.558 --> 07:58.519
RESIST

07:55.558 --> 07:58.519
MY HOT, HOT JAM.

07:58.561 --> 08:00.563
NO ONE CAN

07:58.561 --> 08:00.563
RESIST MY HOT, HOT JAM.

08:00.605 --> 08:02.316
NO ONE CAN

08:00.605 --> 08:02.316
RESIST

08:00.605 --> 08:02.316
MY HOT...

08:02.357 --> 08:04.609
I MADE A FETISH SITE.

08:02.357 --> 08:04.609
WE'RE GONNA MAKE A

08:02.357 --> 08:04.609
FORTUNE.

08:04.651 --> 08:05.693
...MY HOT, HOT JAM.

08:05.735 --> 08:07.528
(door closes)

08:12.575 --> 08:14.953
A FETISH SITE?!

08:12.575 --> 08:14.953
NO ONE CAN RESIST MY HOT--

08:14.995 --> 08:17.331
REMEMBER WHEN YOU FED ME

08:14.995 --> 08:17.331
A TASTE OF YOUR HOT, HOT JAM?

08:17.372 --> 08:20.167
WELL, I REALIZED THAT PERVERTS

08:17.372 --> 08:20.167
WOULD PAY A LOT OF MONEY

08:20.208 --> 08:23.128
TO WATCH US MAKE IT,

08:20.208 --> 08:23.128
WHICH ELI CONFIRMED,

08:23.170 --> 08:24.545
SO HE HELPED ME SET UP

08:23.170 --> 08:24.545
THE

08:23.170 --> 08:24.545
CAMERAS.

08:24.587 --> 08:25.839
CAMERAS?

08:25.880 --> 08:27.966
(whispers) CAMERAS?

08:28.008 --> 08:29.509
(camera whirs)

08:34.389 --> 08:36.599
(computer

08:34.389 --> 08:36.599
beeping)

08:36.641 --> 08:37.851
ELI?

08:37.892 --> 08:39.478
THE SUBJECT IS AWARE.

08:41.062 --> 08:42.230
I CAN'T BELIEVE

08:41.062 --> 08:42.230
YOU WOULD DO THIS!

08:42.272 --> 08:44.274
AND WHO WANTS TO SEE ME

08:42.272 --> 08:44.274
MAKE JAM ANYWAY?

08:44.316 --> 08:48.987
IT'S A VERY SCIENTIFIC PROCESS.

08:44.316 --> 08:48.987
THERE IS NOTHING SEXY ABOUT IT!

08:49.029 --> 08:51.031
(both giggle)

08:52.782 --> 08:54.326
(moans)

08:52.782 --> 08:54.326
MM-HMM.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.205
OHH.

08:58.246 --> 09:00.832
(smacking sounds)

09:02.459 --> 09:03.584
OH

09:03.626 --> 09:07.172
(giggling)

09:07.214 --> 09:09.590
(both laugh)

09:09.632 --> 09:11.259
(giggles)

09:13.053 --> 09:15.430
IS THAT WHY WE WERE HAVING

09:13.053 --> 09:15.430
ALL THOSE PILLOW

09:13.053 --> 09:15.430
FIGHTS?

09:15.472 --> 09:17.598
JUNE, YOU'RE MISSING

09:15.472 --> 09:17.598
THE BIG PICTURE HERE.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.600
WE'RE GONNA BE RICH. RIGHT, ELI?

09:19.642 --> 09:21.811
TOTALLY. YOU GUYS ARE

09:19.642 --> 09:21.811
GONNA

09:19.642 --> 09:21.811
MAKE SO MUCH MONEY,

09:21.853 --> 09:24.022
AS SOON

09:21.853 --> 09:24.022
AS THE FREE TRIAL PERIOD ENDS.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.232
FREE TRIAL

09:24.064 --> 09:25.232
PERIOD?

09:25.273 --> 09:26.441
WELL, WE NEED

09:25.273 --> 09:26.441
TO GET PEOPLE INTERESTED

09:26.483 --> 09:27.859
BEFORE WE CAN

09:26.483 --> 09:27.859
ASK THEM TO PAY.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.195
THE FOOD FETISH MARKET

09:27.901 --> 09:30.195
IS SATURATED RIGHT

09:27.901 --> 09:30.195
NOW.

09:30.237 --> 09:32.613
YOU'VE GOT SALAD SHOOTERS,

09:30.237 --> 09:32.613
GRANDMA'S GARDEN,

09:32.655 --> 09:34.615
RIPE CHERRIES,

09:32.655 --> 09:34.615
MELON

09:32.655 --> 09:34.615
BALLERS--

09:34.657 --> 09:35.867
SO WE'VE MADE NO MONEY?!

09:35.909 --> 09:38.619
NOT  YET.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.619
BUT IN 54 SHORT DAYS, I...

09:38.661 --> 09:39.787
(blinds rattle)

09:39.829 --> 09:42.665
I CAN'T  BELIEVE

09:39.829 --> 09:42.665
YOU WOULD DO THIS!

09:42.707 --> 09:43.833
I CAN'T BELIEVE

09:42.707 --> 09:43.833
YOU'D PUT ME ON A PORN SITE!

09:43.875 --> 09:46.545
THAT IS WRONG

09:43.875 --> 09:46.545
IN SO MANY WAYS!

09:46.586 --> 09:49.881
IT'S A FETISH SITE. AND IT'S NOT

09:46.586 --> 09:49.881
WRONG. IT'S ANOTHER GRAY

09:46.586 --> 09:49.881
AREA.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.633
YOU WOULD'VE BEEN MAKING THE JAM

09:49.923 --> 09:52.633
WHETHER OR NOT WE FILMED IT.

09:52.675 --> 09:55.429
THERE IS NO SUCH THING

09:52.675 --> 09:55.429
AS A GRAY AREA!

09:55.470 --> 09:57.680
YOU  EXPLOITED  ME

09:55.470 --> 09:57.680
WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE.

09:57.722 --> 09:59.349
YOU'RE BEING VERY JUDGMENTAL

09:57.722 --> 09:59.349
RIGHT NOW.

09:59.391 --> 10:01.268
THAT'S NOT VERY KOREAN

09:59.391 --> 10:01.268
OF YOU.

10:01.309 --> 10:03.353
YOU NEVER BELIEVED

10:01.309 --> 10:03.353
IN THE JAM.

10:03.395 --> 10:04.938
WELL, I'M GONNA GO SELL IT

10:03.395 --> 10:04.938
WITHOUT YOU.

10:04.979 --> 10:08.316
AND EVEN IF I FAIL, I'LL GO HOME

10:04.979 --> 10:08.316
TO INDIANA PENNILESS,

10:08.358 --> 10:11.486
KNOWING THAT I DID

10:08.358 --> 10:11.486
THE RIGHT

10:08.358 --> 10:11.486
THING.

10:14.155 --> 10:15.740
I'M NOT PAYING YOU BACK

10:14.155 --> 10:15.740
FOR THE CAMERAS.

10:15.782 --> 10:18.243
(Eli) THAT'S FINE. I'VE GOT

10:15.782 --> 10:18.243
A COUPLE OTHER WEB SITES

10:15.782 --> 10:18.243
GOING.

10:18.285 --> 10:20.287
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY GIRLS

10:18.285 --> 10:20.287
IN THE BUILDING.

10:20.328 --> 10:21.538
(breathy voice)

10:20.328 --> 10:21.538
I WAS JUST READING

10:21.580 --> 10:24.499
A VERY CRITICAL LETTER

10:21.580 --> 10:24.499
FROM MY MOTHER.

10:24.541 --> 10:28.169
SHE'S UPSET THAT I DIDN'T GO

10:24.541 --> 10:28.169
TO MY UNCLE PAT'S SURGERY.

10:28.211 --> 10:29.879
(inhales sharply) OW.

10:29.921 --> 10:32.299
(static)

10:29.921 --> 10:32.299
(sneezes) SORRY.

10:32.340 --> 10:34.259
(static)

10:32.340 --> 10:34.259
I HAVE A LOT OF CATS.

10:34.301 --> 10:35.969
(horn honks)

10:38.012 --> 10:40.890
I CAN'T BELIEVE CHLOE SECRETLY

10:38.012 --> 10:40.890
FILMED YOU MAKING THIS STUFF.

10:40.932 --> 10:42.142
ME, NEITHER.

10:42.183 --> 10:43.977
WHAT WAS THE NAME

10:42.183 --> 10:43.977
OF THAT WEB SITE AGAIN?

10:44.018 --> 10:46.687
YOU KNOW, JUST SO I CAN

10:44.018 --> 10:46.687
MAKE

10:44.018 --> 10:46.687
SURE IT'S DEFINITELY SHUT DOWN.

10:46.729 --> 10:47.772
(door bells jingle,

10:46.729 --> 10:47.772
horn honks)

10:47.814 --> 10:49.357
ELI. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

10:49.399 --> 10:51.734
I'M A HEALTH INSPECTOR.

10:49.399 --> 10:51.734
I'M HERE ON OFFICIAL BUSINESS.

10:51.776 --> 10:55.071
SHUT UP, YOU

10:51.776 --> 10:55.071
PERV.

10:51.776 --> 10:55.071
YOU'RE NOT A HEALTH

10:51.776 --> 10:55.071
INSPECTOR.

10:55.113 --> 10:56.490
(laughs nervously) JUNE!

10:56.531 --> 10:58.866
W-WHAT THE--WHAT ARE YOU DOING,

10:56.531 --> 10:58.866
COMING IN HOT LIKE THAT?

10:58.908 --> 11:01.411
OF COURSE MR. WEBER IS

10:58.908 --> 11:01.411
A HEALTH INSPECTOR.

11:01.453 --> 11:04.080
HE CITED US FOUR TIMES

11:01.453 --> 11:04.080
IN THE LAST MONTH.

11:04.122 --> 11:06.124
WE'VE REMEDIED THE PROBLEM,

11:04.122 --> 11:06.124
BY THE WAY.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.875
WE'VE COMPLETELY CHANGED

11:06.166 --> 11:07.875
OUR POLICY

11:07.917 --> 11:10.211
REGARDING THE 3-SECOND RULE,

11:07.917 --> 11:10.211
SO...

11:10.253 --> 11:11.712
(muffin thuds)

AT THE BATHROOM CAM FOOTAGE

17:22.750 --> 17:24.084
THAT WE SHOT

17:22.750 --> 17:24.084
FOR THE WEB SITE,

17:24.126 --> 17:26.086
AND I STARTED TO FEEL

17:24.126 --> 17:26.086
REALLY BAD.

17:26.128 --> 17:28.464
YOU PUT A CAMERA

17:26.128 --> 17:28.464
IN THE BATHROOM?!

17:28.506 --> 17:29.924
OH, NO.

17:29.966 --> 17:32.760
WHAT IS--WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

17:32.802 --> 17:34.387
IS THAT A MOLE?

17:37.139 --> 17:38.766
OH, GOOD. WHAT WAS THAT?

17:38.808 --> 17:41.101
WAS IT

17:38.808 --> 17:41.101
CHOCOLATE?

17:41.143 --> 17:43.103
I DON'T KNOW.

17:43.145 --> 17:44.104
OH, MY GOD.

17:44.146 --> 17:47.107
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

17:49.360 --> 17:51.946
BUT THE POINT IS, I FELT BAD

17:49.360 --> 17:51.946
SO I'M PAYING YOUR RENT.

17:51.988 --> 17:53.489
YOU ARE?

17:53.531 --> 17:56.158
WELL, AFTER WHAT YOU DID TO

17:53.531 --> 17:56.158
ME,

17:53.531 --> 17:56.158
I DON'T REALLY WANT YOUR HELP.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.118
COME ON. I DON'T WANT YOU

17:56.200 --> 17:58.118
TO HAVE TO MOVE HOME.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.203
PLEASE. YOU DON'T

17:58.160 --> 17:59.203
CARE.

17:59.245 --> 18:03.123
I DO. IT TURNS OUT I DON'T HATE

17:59.245 --> 18:03.123
HAVING YOU AROUND.

18:03.165 --> 18:05.125
(whispers) OH,

18:03.165 --> 18:05.125
GOD.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.586
I AM A TERRIBLE PERSON

18:06.627 --> 18:09.129
AND A VERY BAD KOREAN.

18:09.171 --> 18:11.758
I AM SO SORRY

18:09.171 --> 18:11.758
FOR WHAT I HAVE DONE TO YOU.

18:11.799 --> 18:12.967
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

18:13.009 --> 18:15.135
I SOLD YOU TO ROBIN.

18:15.177 --> 18:16.387
I MADE A LOT OF MONEY

18:16.429 --> 18:18.180
LETTING HER DO THINGS WITH YOU

18:16.429 --> 18:18.180
WITHOUT YOU

18:16.429 --> 18:18.180
KNOWING.

18:18.222 --> 18:19.849
SHE EVEN

18:18.222 --> 18:19.849
AGREED

18:18.222 --> 18:19.849
TO PAY ME $400

18:19.891 --> 18:22.142
TO MAKE A TOAST TO YOU TONIGHT

18:19.891 --> 18:22.142
IN FRONT OF EVERYONE.

18:22.184 --> 18:23.644
HUH.

18:23.686 --> 18:25.730
NICE SCAM. I'M IMPRESSED.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.440
NO, WHAT I DID WAS WRONG.

18:27.481 --> 18:28.858
IS IT?

18:28.900 --> 18:31.151
I MEAN, I'M NOT MAD,

18:28.900 --> 18:31.151
AND LOOK HOW HAPPY ROBIN IS.

18:31.193 --> 18:32.445
YOU'RE LIKE

18:32.486 --> 18:34.739
THE MIDWESTERN MOTHER TERESA

18:32.486 --> 18:34.739
FOR PATHETIC PEOPLE.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.657
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO

18:34.781 --> 18:36.657
ME?

18:36.699 --> 18:38.034
THIS IS

18:36.699 --> 18:38.034
JUST LIKE IN THE

18:36.699 --> 18:38.034
MOVIES

18:38.076 --> 18:39.869
WHEN THE GOOD PERSON MAKES

18:38.076 --> 18:39.869
THE BAD PERSON BETTER,

18:39.911 --> 18:42.162
ONLY IN REVERSE.

18:42.204 --> 18:43.873
YOU'RE MAKING ME

18:42.204 --> 18:43.873
WORSE.

18:43.915 --> 18:45.833
NO WAY.

18:43.915 --> 18:45.833
YOU'RE  MAKING  ME  WORSE.

18:45.875 --> 18:47.167
BECAUSE OF YOU,

18:45.875 --> 18:47.167
I FEEL GUILTY

18:47.209 --> 18:49.169
ABOUT THINGS THAT I SHOULDN'T

18:47.209 --> 18:49.169
EVEN CARE ABOUT--

18:49.211 --> 18:51.338
THE WEB SITE, ROBIN.

18:51.380 --> 18:54.092
I EVEN KINDA FEEL BAD

18:51.380 --> 18:54.092
ABOUT THE JAMES THING.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.175
WHAT JAMES THING?

18:55.217 --> 18:57.177
WELL, THAT WAS MY PLAN

18:55.217 --> 18:57.177
TO PAY OUR RENT.

18:57.219 --> 18:58.805
I

18:57.219 --> 18:58.805
LOOSENED

18:57.219 --> 18:58.805
THE UPSTAIRS RAILINGS

18:58.846 --> 19:00.640
SO THAT I COULD TRIP

18:58.846 --> 19:00.640
AND ACCIDENTALLY FALL

19:00.681 --> 19:03.059
AND THEN SUE HIM FOR DAMAGES.

19:03.101 --> 19:04.226
WHAT? HE'S SUPER RICH.

19:04.268 --> 19:07.271
PLUS HE'S THE ONE THAT SAID

19:04.268 --> 19:07.271
I SHOULD GET CREATIVE.

19:07.313 --> 19:08.564
(clinking glass)

19:08.606 --> 19:10.190
HI.

19:10.232 --> 19:12.234
I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A TOAST.

19:12.276 --> 19:17.281
UM, WEBSTER'S DICTIONARY DEFINES

19:12.276 --> 19:17.281
THE WORD "FRIEND" AS--

19:17.323 --> 19:18.866
(metal cracks)

19:17.323 --> 19:18.866
NO!

19:18.908 --> 19:20.076
NOT FINISHED!

19:18.908 --> 19:20.076
(murmuring)

19:20.118 --> 19:21.201
(thud)

19:20.118 --> 19:21.201
(gasps)

19:21.243 --> 19:22.703
(Robin) OW. OW.

19:22.745 --> 19:24.580
OH, MY GOD. IS SHE OKAY?

19:22.745 --> 19:24.580
OW. OW. OW.

19:24.622 --> 19:25.665
I'M OKAY.

19:25.706 --> 19:28.208
WERE YOU GONNA SAY SOMETHING?

19:25.706 --> 19:28.208
A TOAST?

19:28.250 --> 19:29.669
OH, YEAH.

19:30.711 --> 19:33.464
OH, WHY, THANK YOU. THAT'S NICE.

19:33.506 --> 19:38.011
IT DEFINES THE WORD "FRIEND" AS

19:33.506 --> 19:38.011
ONE WHO IS ATTACHED TO

19:33.506 --> 19:38.011
ANOTHER

19:38.052 --> 19:42.431
BY ESTEEM, AFFECTION,

19:38.052 --> 19:42.431
AND LOYALTY.

19:42.473 --> 19:43.808
THANK YOU.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.935
GREAT TOAST, HUH?

19:43.850 --> 19:45.935
CHEERS!

19:45.977 --> 19:48.104

19:48.146 --> 19:49.229
(June)

19:48.146 --> 19:49.229
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY?

19:49.271 --> 19:51.732
UH-HUH. DID WE SAY $400?

19:51.774 --> 19:55.111
OH, IT'S

19:51.774 --> 19:55.111
OKAY.

19:51.774 --> 19:55.111
IT'S... ON THE HOUSE.

19:55.153 --> 19:56.236
AWESOME.

19:56.278 --> 19:57.947
THAT WAS REALLY NICE OF US.

19:57.989 --> 19:59.699
MAYBE WE'RE MAKING EACH OTHER

19:57.989 --> 19:59.699
BETTER.

19:59.740 --> 20:00.908
MM! (giggles)

20:00.950 --> 20:02.242
WELL,

20:00.950 --> 20:02.242
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY

20:00.950 --> 20:02.242
SAY.

20:02.284 --> 20:05.955
WHEN THE HARVEST COMES

20:02.284 --> 20:05.955
AND THE BIRDS HAVE FLOWN,

20:05.997 --> 20:07.874
THAT  WILL BE THE

20:05.997 --> 20:07.874
TIME.

20:07.915 --> 20:09.542
♪♪

20:09.583 --> 20:11.669
READ THE DAMN

20:09.583 --> 20:11.669
PLAY!

20:11.711 --> 20:13.129
I'M GONNA GET UP.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.129
I'M JUST RESTING.

20:13.171 --> 20:14.964
(door closes)

20:19.301 --> 20:22.221
(funk music playing)

20:35.317 --> 20:37.153
AHH.

20:37.195 --> 20:39.197
(squishing)

20:39.238 --> 20:41.115
SLOW JAM.

(inhales deeply)

20:43.325 --> 20:45.285
(exhales deeply)

20:45.327 --> 20:47.371
NANA, YOU'RE

20:45.327 --> 20:47.371
THERE

20:45.327 --> 20:47.371
SO THEY CAN TAKE CARE OF YOU.

20:47.413 --> 20:49.707
I'M SURE THEY'LL GIVE YOU BACON

20:47.413 --> 20:49.707
IF YOU ASK.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.542
PUT THE NURSE ON THE PHONE.

20:51.584 --> 20:54.294
DO NOT GIVE HER BACON.

20:51.584 --> 20:54.294
PUT HER BACK ON.

20:54.336 --> 20:57.297
DID YOU SEE "CASTLE" LAST NIGHT?

20:57.339 --> 21:00.801
I KNOW! IT  IS  GETTING BETTER.
