Ty: Look, Amy, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

00:03.539 --> 00:04.306
Is it about our trip?

00:04.373 --> 00:07.108
I want to go up there
by myself.

00:07.676 --> 00:08.042
Okay.

00:08.109 --> 00:10.678
Jack: What was that
about Eagle Lake?

00:10.746 --> 00:12.447

Ty:
What are you doing here?

00:14.115 --> 00:15.983
Jack: Oh, I figured you
might use some company.

00:16.050 --> 00:16.984
I should have brought Amy.

00:17.052 --> 00:18.453
Jack:
Why didn't ya?

00:18.520 --> 00:20.187
I guess there's a side of me
I didn't want her to see,

00:20.255 --> 00:21.021
so I just took off.

00:21.089 --> 00:23.157
I just got a job offer.
It's a consulting job.

00:23.225 --> 00:24.793

where you want to go,

08:21.607 --> 08:22.873
but you can't
quite get there

08:22.941 --> 08:24.140

take you seriously

in Moose Jaw.

latest whistle stop.

08:45.729 --> 08:47.062
You have a lawyer?

08:47.130 --> 08:50.098
Yeah. I gotta have a lawyer
to win a custody case.

08:50.166 --> 08:51.233

for custody?

08:51.301 --> 08:52.435
Joint custody,
yeah.

08:52.502 --> 08:53.636
Since when?

08:53.704 --> 08:55.537
What? Since she cut off
all contact

08:55.604 --> 08:56.604
with me and my son!

08:56.672 --> 08:58.005
Okay, Dad,
that is bad,

08:58.073 --> 08:59.040
but have you thought
this through?

08:59.107 --> 09:00.074
Because this is huge.

09:00.142 --> 09:01.075
Yeah, I've thought it
through.

09:01.143 --> 09:02.777
It is huge.
It could be landmark.

09:02.845 --> 09:04.979

based on her character,

09:05.047 --> 09:07.415
I got a real shot.
(Cell phone rings)

09:08.884 --> 09:09.984

get that,

more important.

09:55.528 --> 09:56.895

aren't too bad.

much of a choice.

10:20.584 --> 10:21.951

and somebody'll come along.

10:45.074 --> 10:47.208
I'm willing to bet
fifty bucks on it.

10:48.176 --> 10:49.209
You're on.

10:51.914 --> 10:52.980
(Grimaces)

10:55.517 --> 10:57.418
(Hooves thud)

10:57.486 --> 10:58.486
Tim:
Hey!

10:59.855 --> 11:02.323
Hey! Just the girl
I wanted to see.

11:04.926 --> 11:06.292
(Truck door opens)

11:08.162 --> 11:09.496
I gotta ask
a favour of ya.

11:09.564 --> 11:11.264
Oh, sure, but did you
happen to see a horse

11:11.332 --> 11:11.865
when you were driving?

11:11.933 --> 11:13.366
What? No?
What kind of horse?

11:13.434 --> 11:16.135
He's a wild horse,
a leopard Appaloosa.

11:16.203 --> 11:17.437
His name's Ghost.

11:17.505 --> 11:18.905
A wild horse
with a name?

11:18.973 --> 11:20.439
I'm just asking
if you saw him?

11:20.507 --> 11:21.607
Honey,
it's pretty unlikely

11:21.675 --> 11:22.407
to see a wild horse
around here.

11:22.476 --> 11:23.943
Everything's fenced.

11:24.010 --> 11:25.310
That's why I'm not quite sure
if I saw him or...

11:25.578 --> 11:27.746
Or if he was a ghost?

11:27.814 --> 11:29.548
(Sighs heavily)
I've seen this horse before,

11:29.615 --> 11:31.684
and the weird part is
Ty was the only one

11:31.751 --> 11:33.085
who could ever
get close to him.

11:33.153 --> 11:34.119
So when I saw him--

11:34.187 --> 11:36.054
Or didn't see him.

11:36.121 --> 11:38.156
Okay, I'm sorry.
Honey, I'm listening.

11:38.223 --> 11:39.824
It just made me
think of Ty.

11:39.892 --> 11:42.827
He's on that
motorcycle trip and...

11:43.796 --> 11:45.129
I'm still listening.

11:45.998 --> 11:47.765
I think I'm just gonna
go up on that ridge,

11:47.833 --> 11:49.200
have a look for him.

11:49.301 --> 11:51.069
Okay,
but about this favour?

11:51.136 --> 11:53.403
Yeah, uh,
lunch or something.

11:53.470 --> 11:55.772
Okay, yeah, we can...
we can have lunch.

11:56.774 --> 11:58.474
Amy:
(Sighs heavily)

12:01.813 --> 12:03.279
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>How is it?</i>

12:03.347 --> 12:07.117
Jack: Oh, it's nothin' to
get too excited about.

12:07.185 --> 12:09.018
(Grimaces in pain)

12:09.086 --> 12:11.153
Jack: You know, I laid
my bike down once.

12:11.221 --> 12:13.255
I got such a bad case
of road rash

12:13.323 --> 12:14.990
my pants nearly disintegrated.

12:15.058 --> 12:16.225
(Exhales sharply)

12:16.292 --> 12:18.260
<i>Jack:</i>
<i>Kind of like these ones.</i>

12:18.328 --> 12:20.295
I should have bought a pair
of leather pants, I guess,

12:20.363 --> 12:22.098
but who can afford that?

12:22.165 --> 12:23.865
That'd be good...

12:23.933 --> 12:25.666
You in leather pants.

12:25.735 --> 12:26.801
(Chuckles)

12:28.303 --> 12:29.303
(Grunts)

12:31.673 --> 12:33.208
I lied about the nudists.

12:33.275 --> 12:35.343
You know,
a gravel road like that

12:35.410 --> 12:37.645
would be hell on their feet,
don't ya think?

12:37.713 --> 12:39.714
<i>No, I think our best bet's</i>
<i>the fishermen.</i>

12:39.781 --> 12:41.148
<i>A lake like that?</i>

12:41.216 --> 12:42.883
You know,
you hold a frying pan

12:42.951 --> 12:44.317
a fish'd jump
right into it.

12:45.653 --> 12:47.888
<i>Ty? Come on, man!</i>

12:47.956 --> 12:49.056
Ty!

12:49.124 --> 12:50.157
You gotta hold on!

12:51.226 --> 12:53.193
I gotta collect
on that bet.

12:53.261 --> 12:54.661
Jack in past: What the hell
are you doin' down there?

12:54.729 --> 12:55.962
What do you think?

12:56.029 --> 12:58.798
Jack: I think you
owe me 50 bucks!

13:00.333 --> 13:02.601
Someone's been doing
a little dumpster diving.

13:02.669 --> 13:04.737
Jack in present:
Ty, stay with me now!

13:04.805 --> 13:06.505
Don't you go anywhere!

13:06.573 --> 13:07.874
I just want to know
why you...

13:07.941 --> 13:09.475
You didn't even try to call me
or anything?

13:09.542 --> 13:11.477
Amy, I don't know,
I...

13:12.612 --> 13:13.679
I don't know.
I don't...

13:13.747 --> 13:14.980
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Run away!</i>

13:15.047 --> 13:17.048
It's what you always do,
even when people-

13:17.116 --> 13:18.317
when I want you
to stay!

13:19.386 --> 13:21.353
I don't wanna hurt you,
Amy.

13:21.421 --> 13:22.954
I guess I'm willing
to risk that.

13:23.022 --> 13:24.390
I'm not. I...

13:25.558 --> 13:26.258
(Sighs heavily)

13:26.326 --> 13:27.426
Amy, look!

13:30.896 --> 13:33.364
(Water flows,
Ty gasps sharply)

13:35.668 --> 13:37.635
(Breathing heavily)

13:39.505 --> 13:40.738
If I die...

13:40.806 --> 13:42.540
That's not gonna happen.

13:42.608 --> 13:43.874
My dad, he died.

13:43.942 --> 13:45.642
Well, that had nothing
to do with you.

13:45.710 --> 13:48.712
He never stopped
running away.

13:49.781 --> 13:52.783
I never wanted
to be like him.

13:54.051 --> 13:56.353
You'll tell Amy that.

14:02.659 --> 14:04.159
(Hooves thud)

14:19.475 --> 14:21.008
(Door creaks open)

15:01.415 --> 15:02.715
(Water sloshes)

15:07.687 --> 15:09.355
- Jack?
- Yeah.

15:11.224 --> 15:13.359
Ty, we can't wait
around any more.

15:13.426 --> 15:15.127
I'm gonna go get help.

15:15.195 --> 15:17.997
Now, you gotta keep
drinkin' water.

15:18.965 --> 15:21.032
Okay, I'll be back
before you know it!

15:22.935 --> 15:25.636
I'll get you a case of beer
when I find help.

15:25.704 --> 15:27.005
(Breathes hard)

15:32.411 --> 15:33.611
(Weakly) Okay.

15:40.251 --> 15:41.251
(Sighs heavily)

15:41.319 --> 15:42.386
(Door closes)

15:44.055 --> 15:46.256
Lou: Good, you're back.
Where have you been?

15:46.324 --> 15:47.557
Why? Did Ty call?

15:47.625 --> 15:50.360
No. Isn't he coming back
tomorrow?

15:50.428 --> 15:52.595
Yeah, that's what
he said but...

15:52.663 --> 15:54.030
But what?

15:54.097 --> 15:54.931
I don't know.
I just had this feeling.

15:54.998 --> 15:57.566
I... I saw Ghost.

15:57.634 --> 15:59.001
You saw a ghost?

15:59.069 --> 16:02.438
No, Ghost, that horse,
the Appaloosa.

16:02.505 --> 16:05.574
- I saw him again.
- And evil walks among us?

16:05.642 --> 16:07.876
Come on, Amy,
you are obsessing, okay?

16:07.945 --> 16:09.610
Ty will call
when he calls.

16:09.678 --> 16:11.179
You're right.

16:11.247 --> 16:12.981
Hey, I gotta get ready.
I'm having lunch with Dad.

16:13.049 --> 16:14.749
Uh, hmm.

16:14.817 --> 16:15.750
What?

16:15.818 --> 16:16.884
No, nothing.
You know what?

16:16.953 --> 16:20.322
He can tell you.
But I have news!

16:20.389 --> 16:22.557
- Good news?
- Hmm. Sort of.

16:22.624 --> 16:24.259
I got offered
a promotion at work.

16:24.327 --> 16:25.492
That's amazing, Lou!

16:25.560 --> 16:27.061
I know, but they want me
to start working

16:27.128 --> 16:28.829
five days a week
as of the new year.

16:28.896 --> 16:30.097
Well,
tell 'em you can't.

16:30.165 --> 16:31.231
Are you kidding?

16:31.299 --> 16:32.366
This is an incredible
opportunity!

16:32.434 --> 16:35.970
The problem is
how am I gonna tell Peter?

16:36.037 --> 16:37.537
Just tell him
like you told me.

16:37.605 --> 16:40.341
You didn't seem
at a loss for words then.

16:42.109 --> 16:43.142
(Sighs)

16:43.844 --> 16:45.211
(Metal clatters)

16:57.704 --> 17:00.006
- Custody?
- Well, joint custody.

17:00.073 --> 17:01.639
Where did this
come from?

17:01.707 --> 17:02.874
My Detective told me.

17:02.941 --> 17:03.941
Your detective?

17:04.010 --> 17:05.510
Yeah,
I got a private detective.

17:05.577 --> 17:06.711
My lawyer told me
to get one.

17:06.778 --> 17:09.013
How else am I gonna build
a custody case?

17:09.080 --> 17:10.948
I did some digging,
and I can tell ya

17:11.017 --> 17:12.317
I am worried
about the kid.

17:12.385 --> 17:13.751
The last time
I talked with Shane

17:13.819 --> 17:14.986
he seemed fine.

17:15.054 --> 17:16.787
Well, I wouldn't know,
because when I call

17:16.855 --> 17:18.788
his mother just threatens
to pick up and leave,

17:18.856 --> 17:21.858
and that is unstable behaviour
by any definition.

17:21.925 --> 17:23.193
Yeah, I guess.

17:24.128 --> 17:27.431
The boy needs a father
and a home.

17:27.499 --> 17:28.932
I just want my son
to be with me,

17:29.000 --> 17:31.768
not on occasional
weekends.

17:32.970 --> 17:34.103
And what does
Shane want?

17:34.171 --> 17:35.271
Well, that's the thing.

17:35.339 --> 17:36.539
I think it would
really help my case

17:36.606 --> 17:38.307
to get a handle on
his real feelings, you know,

17:38.375 --> 17:40.443
like where he wants
to really live.

17:40.511 --> 17:41.577
Waitress:
Hey.

17:43.480 --> 17:44.414
Thank you.

17:44.481 --> 17:45.648
Waitress:
Mmm-hmm.

17:45.715 --> 17:50.118
But I can't call him...

17:50.186 --> 17:51.719
Because of that woman!

17:51.787 --> 17:54.156
Since when did Miranda
become "that woman"?

17:54.223 --> 17:58.460
Amy, you have a real
relationship with Shane.

17:58.528 --> 18:00.328
And I'm guessing this is
where the favour comes in.

18:00.396 --> 18:01.896
Well, you're probably
talking to him already

18:01.964 --> 18:03.532
on that Facebook thing,
right?

18:03.599 --> 18:05.366
Yes,
on the Facebook thing.

18:05.434 --> 18:06.900
So you could get
a lot of information

18:06.968 --> 18:08.135
just by looking
at his pictures,

18:08.203 --> 18:09.370
finding out
who he hangs out with,

18:09.438 --> 18:10.771
what he likes to do,

18:10.838 --> 18:13.541
and you could become
friends with Miranda.

18:13.608 --> 18:15.042
Are you serious?

18:16.010 --> 18:19.113
Okay, well, just talk
to Shane, will ya?

18:19.181 --> 18:20.681
Dad, you're not asking me
to talk to him,

18:20.748 --> 18:23.416
you're asking me
to spy on him.

18:23.484 --> 18:25.385
(Frustrated sigh)

18:25.453 --> 18:26.519
Yeah.

18:27.588 --> 18:29.755
So... forget it.

18:29.823 --> 18:31.023
Sorry I mentioned it.

18:31.092 --> 18:32.358
You know, I wanna help
you out, I do.

18:32.426 --> 18:35.395
No, no, it's okay,
forget it.

18:43.936 --> 18:46.972

are you doin' here?

20:31.571 --> 20:32.770
I need your help, Ty.

20:32.838 --> 20:34.806
Okay, you want to know
about my dad?

20:34.873 --> 20:36.708
Pretty much my whole life,
he's been in and out of prison.

20:36.775 --> 20:39.311
If you knew all this
then why did you go see him?

20:39.378 --> 20:41.713
He's my dad, Amy.

Ty, you're nothing

Ty shouts in pain)

21:08.505 --> 21:09.539
(Gasping)

21:12.976 --> 21:15.245
It's like he's trying to win
father of the year award.

21:15.312 --> 21:17.512
He actually says
"A boy needs his dad."

21:17.580 --> 21:18.813
Huh.

21:18.881 --> 21:19.948
It's a good thing girls
don't need their dads,

21:20.015 --> 21:22.417
or else you and I'd be
pretty screwed up.

21:22.485 --> 21:23.685
Do you know
he actually wanted me

21:23.753 --> 21:25.153
to pump Shane and Miranda
for information?

21:25.221 --> 21:26.255
<i>Can you believe that?</i>

21:26.322 --> 21:28.089
Coming from Dad?
Totally.

21:28.157 --> 21:31.192
But, look, he obviously wants
a relationship with Shane

21:31.261 --> 21:33.128
even if he has to go
to court to get it.

21:33.195 --> 21:35.730
I don't care!
I feel like he's using me.

21:35.797 --> 21:37.097
Well, did you say something?

<i>Amy:</i>
<i>No.</i>

(Sighs) You know me,
I'm terrible at that.

21:41.436 --> 21:42.603
I'm the same way with Ty.

21:42.671 --> 21:43.871
Maybe if I had have
said something

21:43.938 --> 21:45.306
I would've been on
that road trip with him

21:45.374 --> 21:47.308
instead of sitting here
waiting for him to call.

21:47.376 --> 21:50.510
Honey, he is probably
off the grid.

21:50.578 --> 21:51.745
(Frustrated sigh)

21:51.813 --> 21:52.980
I just don't want to be
one of those girls

21:53.047 --> 21:55.415
who calls and texts
all the time--

21:55.483 --> 21:56.716
And I don't blame you,

21:56.785 --> 21:59.253
but if it was you,
I'd be one of those girls.

21:59.320 --> 22:00.487
So you would call?

22:00.554 --> 22:02.589
Or send a text.
Three words.

22:02.657 --> 22:04.457
I love you,
I miss you...

22:04.525 --> 22:06.392
No "where the hell
are you?"

22:06.459 --> 22:07.493
That's four words.

22:07.560 --> 22:08.795
Five, actually.

22:10.164 --> 22:11.931
(Amy chuckles)

22:25.044 --> 22:26.778
(Sighs,
dialling beeps)

22:31.483 --> 22:32.650
<i>Ty's voice-mail message:</i>
<i>Hi, leave a message at the tone.</i>

22:32.718 --> 22:34.085
(Answering machine beeps)

22:34.153 --> 22:36.587
Hey, it's just me,
I'm...

22:36.655 --> 22:38.689
Just wondering
how you're doin'.

22:38.756 --> 22:39.957
Hope everything's well.

22:40.025 --> 22:41.725
Just give me a call
when you can.

22:41.793 --> 22:43.327
Okay.

22:43.394 --> 22:44.829
(Phone beeps off)

22:49.301 --> 22:50.367
(Eagle cries)

22:52.570 --> 22:53.603
(Door shuts)

22:55.272 --> 22:57.573
Hey, Lou?
(Bags thump)

22:57.641 --> 22:59.209
(Katie gurgles)

22:59.276 --> 23:01.177
Hey, there they are,
my two beautiful girls.

23:01.245 --> 23:03.412
Shh...
(Katie gurgles)

23:03.480 --> 23:05.148
(Whispers) Okay...

23:05.216 --> 23:08.718
Honey, I am so glad
you're home,

23:08.785 --> 23:11.686
because I had such
a crazy day.

23:11.754 --> 23:14.923
I want to hear
all about it too.

23:17.827 --> 23:19.761
Lou: First of all,
Katie was incredible.

23:19.829 --> 23:20.729
Peter:
Incredibly cute, you mean?

23:20.796 --> 23:22.231
Cranky.

23:22.298 --> 23:24.699
She refused her sippy cup,
insisted on her bottle

23:24.767 --> 23:26.367
just when I had like
a million emails

23:26.434 --> 23:28.535
that had to be answered
immediately.

23:28.603 --> 23:31.305
Oh, and then my dad is in
a full-on custody battle

23:31.373 --> 23:32.573
with Miranda.

23:32.640 --> 23:34.242
Ah, ouch.
Those can get ugly.

23:34.309 --> 23:35.509
Yeah, I think it already has.

23:35.577 --> 23:37.912
Anyway... muah!
How was Vancouver?

23:37.980 --> 23:39.713
Uh, good.
Cold, wet, rainy,

23:39.781 --> 23:42.315
but every cloud has
a silver lining because...

23:42.383 --> 23:43.316
What?

23:43.384 --> 23:44.951
My part-time
consulting gig

23:45.019 --> 23:47.220
turned into
a full-time job offer.

23:47.288 --> 23:49.088
Really?!
A full-time job!

23:49.155 --> 23:50.789
- Yup.
- In Vancouver.

23:50.857 --> 23:52.191
Yeah, there'll be
a bit of travel there,

23:52.259 --> 23:53.425
but the money's okay

23:53.493 --> 23:55.227
and there's lots of room
for advancement.

23:55.295 --> 23:58.497
Um... so you said, yes?

23:58.564 --> 23:59.831
Yeah, there's still
some negotiating to do.

23:59.900 --> 24:01.566
You know, fringes, benefits,
stuff like that,

24:01.634 --> 24:03.735
but, uh, yes,
I said yes, obviously.

24:03.803 --> 24:05.069
Yeah, yes!
(Laughs happily)

24:05.137 --> 24:06.938
Wow!

24:07.006 --> 24:09.274
That is unbelievable.

24:11.810 --> 24:13.244
(Sighs emotionally)

24:13.312 --> 24:15.813
Unbelievably good,
right?

24:15.881 --> 24:18.549
Well, yeah,
of course it's good!

24:20.286 --> 24:22.619
This day just keeps getting
better and better.

24:24.555 --> 24:27.124
Peter: Honey, I know that the
travel could be a problem.

24:27.191 --> 24:28.959
All right, we did
the long distance thing before

24:29.027 --> 24:30.260
and it wasn't great.

24:30.328 --> 24:31.494
Lou: Yeah, except now
we both have jobs

24:31.562 --> 24:33.330
and, oh yeah, I almost forgot,
a baby.

24:33.398 --> 24:35.132
Right. But you see...

24:35.199 --> 24:36.933
I thought it through,
okay,

24:37.000 --> 24:40.069
and there is a way
we can make this work.

24:40.270 --> 24:41.470
Please.

24:41.538 --> 24:42.939
Okay...

24:43.006 --> 24:45.574
While still being
the hands-on type of parents

24:45.642 --> 24:47.576
that we always said
we would be.

24:47.644 --> 24:48.710
- Right.
- <i>See,</i>

24:48.778 --> 24:49.578
now that I'm gonna be
bringing home

24:49.646 --> 24:50.813
a decent pay cheque,

24:50.880 --> 24:53.181
honey, you can be
a full-time mom.

24:53.249 --> 24:54.582
You can have
all the time you need

24:54.650 --> 24:56.351
to do the things
that you really want.

24:56.419 --> 24:58.653
And what would that be?

25:00.957 --> 25:03.124
Peter: You know...
Taking care of Katie,

25:03.192 --> 25:07.963
and, you know, having time
to run the dude ranch and...

25:08.030 --> 25:09.896
Somein' like a momprenuer.

25:09.965 --> 25:11.198
Lou:
(incredulous laugh)

25:11.266 --> 25:14.201
And, um, how exactly
would that happen?

25:14.269 --> 25:15.436
It's easy.
Quit your job and-

25:15.503 --> 25:16.903
Oh, I just...
(incredulous laugh)

25:16.972 --> 25:19.673
Just quit my job,
that's all.

25:33.120 --> 25:34.587
(Distant rumble)

25:42.228 --> 25:44.262
(Truck rumbles loudly)

25:46.065 --> 25:47.632
Jack:
Hey! Hey!

25:47.700 --> 25:49.468
Get your ass back here!

25:49.535 --> 25:50.768
(Loud clank)

25:50.836 --> 25:52.904
(Truck grinds to a halt)

25:54.640 --> 25:55.573
Woody:
What the hell!

25:55.641 --> 25:56.975
I need your help!

25:57.042 --> 25:58.942
Yeah, you need help!
You messed with my truck!

25:59.011 --> 25:59.943
You're a dead man!

26:00.012 --> 26:00.944
(Hard shove)

26:01.013 --> 26:02.046
(Hard thump)

26:08.743 --> 26:09.909
<i>Are you happy now?</i>

26:10.845 --> 26:13.679
No. Look what you did
to my truck!

26:13.748 --> 26:15.514
I'm sorry
I dinged your window.

26:15.582 --> 26:16.749
Dinged?!

26:16.816 --> 26:18.550
If you blow on it,
it'll shatter!

26:18.618 --> 26:20.919
I don't have time to argue.

26:20.987 --> 26:22.520
We got into
a motorcycle accident

26:22.588 --> 26:23.488
a couple miles back.

26:23.556 --> 26:24.923
There's a young kid
there

26:24.991 --> 26:26.424
and he might be
bleedin' to death.

26:26.492 --> 26:28.360
Oh, so you wrecked my truck,
now you want my help?

26:28.427 --> 26:29.527
Well, the world's
a funny place!

26:29.595 --> 26:30.562
I do need your help

26:30.630 --> 26:31.730
and I'm prepared
to pay for it.

26:31.797 --> 26:33.664
How much do you want?

26:33.732 --> 26:35.099
- Hundred bucks.
- Done.

26:35.167 --> 26:36.533
Make it two hundred.

26:36.601 --> 26:37.802
Fine.

26:37.870 --> 26:38.569
Just get me to a phone
that works.

26:38.637 --> 26:40.001
I need an ambulance.

26:40.038 --> 26:42.106
Hey, that two hundred bucks
is on top of the new window, eh?

26:46.511 --> 26:47.944
(Truck starts up)

26:50.081 --> 26:51.815
(Truck rumbles away)

26:53.017 --> 26:54.050
(Exhales)

26:57.822 --> 26:58.855
What?

26:59.590 --> 27:01.291
What?

27:01.358 --> 27:03.293
I need to find her.

27:03.360 --> 27:04.393
What?

27:07.764 --> 27:08.798

27:09.833 --> 27:10.766

Amy: Yes!

you never mentioned her?

27:23.913 --> 27:25.146
Yeah, I did.

27:25.214 --> 27:27.782
No, you always talked
about Grant and Connor.

these months of not working
have been on you.

29:46.079 --> 29:48.713
Peter: Yeah, it hasn't been
that bad, actually, you know?

29:48.781 --> 29:49.915
To tell you the truth,
it's been pretty great

29:49.983 --> 29:51.383

31:52.310 --> 31:53.343
<i>Hello?!</i>

31:56.347 --> 31:57.613
He's hurt pretty bad.

31:57.681 --> 31:58.648
I don't know how far
he could have gone.

31:58.715 --> 31:59.849
Woody:
Well, you'd be surprised.

31:59.917 --> 32:01.151
A wounded deer
covers a lot of ground.

32:01.218 --> 32:02.652
Jack:
Yeah, a deer maybe.

32:02.719 --> 32:03.619
Woody: Hey, you ever
been moose huntin'?

32:03.687 --> 32:04.453
Jack:
Some.

32:04.521 --> 32:05.688
Woody:
Oh ho-ho!

32:05.756 --> 32:06.990
That's the real deal, eh,
moose huntin'?

32:07.057 --> 32:08.424
Or course now a days
these so-called hunters

32:08.492 --> 32:11.194
drive around hoping against hope
they'll find a moose.

32:11.262 --> 32:13.228
They wouldn't know moose scat
from deer scat

32:13.296 --> 32:14.163
if it was on their plate.

32:14.230 --> 32:16.298
All right,
now listen,

32:16.365 --> 32:18.566
I say we split up.

32:18.634 --> 32:19.902
Let's search a grid.

32:19.969 --> 32:22.004
A grid.
That's a great idea.

32:22.071 --> 32:24.539
Trackin' humans is a lot
like trackin' animals,

32:24.607 --> 32:26.809
except humans don't have
a fur coat.

32:26.876 --> 32:29.510
So hypothermia
becomes a factor.

32:29.577 --> 32:31.745
Is it hyperthermia
or hypo, hyper?

32:31.814 --> 32:33.181
You know,
whatever it is,

32:33.248 --> 32:34.615
we don't have
much time here!

32:34.683 --> 32:36.417
Whoa.

32:36.484 --> 32:37.819
We got somethin'.

32:40.989 --> 32:42.656
(Running footsteps)

32:44.526 --> 32:45.658
Well...

32:47.261 --> 32:48.528
Okay.

32:48.595 --> 32:50.697
Jack: Yeah, I used
that on his knee.

32:51.665 --> 32:52.799
Yeah, you see?

32:52.867 --> 32:55.768
We got some, uh,
broken twigs here.

32:57.138 --> 32:59.973
Oh, yeah, look at this.
See right here?

33:00.041 --> 33:03.042
We got material transferred
from one surface to another.

33:03.109 --> 33:05.510
A.K.A. A footprint.

33:05.578 --> 33:08.314
That's the tracker's handbook
chapter 2.

33:08.381 --> 33:09.315
<i>That kid we're lookin' for?</i>

33:09.382 --> 33:10.549
Brown hair,
leather jacket?

33:10.616 --> 33:12.784
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

33:21.227 --> 33:24.462
Ty? Ty. You okay?

33:26.465 --> 33:28.499
Ty:
Yeah.

33:28.567 --> 33:32.003
Where'd you think
you were goin', pal?

33:32.071 --> 33:35.739
Home.
I have to go home.

33:35.806 --> 33:37.407
I have to go home.

33:37.475 --> 33:38.375
<i>Amy:</i> <i>(Whispers)</i>
<i>Can you hear anything?</i>

33:38.442 --> 33:39.376
No, I can't hear that.

33:39.443 --> 33:40.344
Both:
(Chuckle)

33:40.411 --> 33:41.544
(Heartbeat pulses)

33:41.612 --> 33:43.580
- How about now?
- Loud and clear.

33:43.647 --> 33:48.218
If we were just friends,
would I do this?

33:48.286 --> 33:49.618
Both:
(Laugh)

33:49.686 --> 33:50.686
Ty: Behave yourself!
Amy: Be steady!

33:50.754 --> 33:52.454
Amy: Oh!
Ty: Behave yourself!

33:52.522 --> 33:54.523
Both:
(Grunting and laughing)

33:54.591 --> 33:55.557
Amy: (Laughing) Stop! Stop!

33:55.625 --> 33:56.893
Ty: (Laughing) Got ya!

33:56.960 --> 33:57.860
<i>Amy:</i> <i>Hey! Hey!</i> <i>(Water splashes)</i>

33:57.928 --> 34:00.029
Whoa! Agh!
(Water splashes)

34:00.097 --> 34:02.765
I gotta see Amy.
I gotta see her.

34:02.832 --> 34:03.699
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Okay, um...</i>

34:03.767 --> 34:06.301
I know you
don't think so,

34:06.369 --> 34:07.369
but we can be friends.

34:07.436 --> 34:08.937
I mean, we are friends,
right?

34:09.005 --> 34:11.406
Just... we can be
more than that.

34:14.076 --> 34:14.909
<i>(Shouting)</i>
<i>Ty!</i>

34:14.976 --> 34:16.378
(Hooves thunder)

34:16.478 --> 34:17.445
Ty!

34:17.513 --> 34:20.282
Can I have it back?
The ring?

34:21.416 --> 34:22.716
I love you.
I love you too.

34:23.684 --> 34:26.485
You know, I haven't said this
in a while,

34:26.554 --> 34:29.255
but I love you.
I love you.

34:29.324 --> 34:30.791
I love you.

34:33.527 --> 34:34.828
Woody: Figure this Amy
he keeps talkin' about,

34:34.896 --> 34:36.362
that's the girlfriend, right?

34:36.431 --> 34:37.897
Jack:
Yeah.

34:37.965 --> 34:40.733
Well, Ty, we're gonna let
a doctor take a look at ya

34:40.801 --> 34:42.635
and then we're gonna
get you home.

34:42.702 --> 34:44.437
Ty:
I gotta talk to Amy.

34:44.504 --> 34:46.472
Jack: You've got all the time
in the world to talk to Amy.

34:47.440 --> 34:48.975
(Truck rumbles up)

34:55.348 --> 34:57.682
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey.

34:57.750 --> 34:58.984
Honey, listen,

34:59.052 --> 35:00.319
I hope you're not still
ticked off at me, eh?

35:00.386 --> 35:01.686
I shouldn't have asked you
to talk to your brother.

35:01.754 --> 35:03.655
Oh, you mean,
interrogate?

35:03.722 --> 35:05.623
I did it,
I messaged him.

35:05.691 --> 35:07.525
M-messaged him?
What...?

35:07.593 --> 35:08.660
Well, what did he say?

35:08.727 --> 35:11.528
Not much.
He said he's okay.

35:11.596 --> 35:14.999
That's it, he's okay?
That's not what I need.

35:15.067 --> 35:16.067
Well, that's all I got.

35:16.134 --> 35:17.401
Are you gonna talk
to him again?

35:17.469 --> 35:19.703
Now you're really
pushin' it.

35:19.771 --> 35:22.306
Hey, listen,
I'm sorry.

35:22.374 --> 35:23.407
I just figured that

35:23.475 --> 35:24.208
you might wanna help
your father

35:24.276 --> 35:25.908
get custody of his son.

35:25.977 --> 35:27.143
I mean, don't you think
it would be great

35:27.211 --> 35:28.811
if we were all
together?

35:28.879 --> 35:30.146
Amy: You know, I don't know
how great it would be,

35:30.214 --> 35:31.147
especially if you have
to ruin Miranda's life

35:31.215 --> 35:32.248
in order for it happen!

35:32.316 --> 35:33.483
That is unfair, Amy.

35:33.550 --> 35:35.018
I never set out
to hurt anybody.

35:35.086 --> 35:36.419
I just started
asking questions.

35:36.487 --> 35:37.420
Yeah, or paid
a private detective

35:37.488 --> 35:38.421
to ask them for you.

35:38.489 --> 35:39.555
Oh, you know,
you might think

35:39.623 --> 35:41.923
that Miranda's
a wonderful person,

35:41.992 --> 35:43.359
but she cannot be
a good mother

35:43.426 --> 35:44.526
if you knew
how much she moved.

35:44.594 --> 35:45.861
Do you know what
that does to a kid?

35:45.928 --> 35:47.096
Well, guess what?

35:47.163 --> 35:48.297
A kid being raised
by a single mom

35:48.365 --> 35:50.065
isn't easy either!

35:50.133 --> 35:51.600
And I'm just wondering
why it took you this long

35:51.667 --> 35:54.103
to figure that out?!

35:54.170 --> 35:56.138
I have regrets
about what happened

35:56.206 --> 35:57.605
between your mom
and I.

35:57.672 --> 35:58.706
Yeah,
I'm sure you do.

35:58.773 --> 36:00.708
I was young.
I was stupid.

36:00.775 --> 36:03.944
The rodeo was tearin'
my body apart!

36:04.013 --> 36:06.046
I killed the pain
with pills

36:06.114 --> 36:08.648
and the pills
tore up my life!

36:08.716 --> 36:09.782
I'm not making excuses -

36:09.850 --> 36:11.584
excuses are just
a bunch of words.

36:11.652 --> 36:14.287
But that is why I'm trying
to do something about Shane,

36:14.355 --> 36:17.157
because I don't wanna wake up
ten years from now

36:17.225 --> 36:19.993
and find out that
that kid has grown up

36:20.061 --> 36:21.327
and I missed it!

36:21.395 --> 36:24.663
- Dad...
- Because Amy...

36:24.731 --> 36:27.099
Not seeing you grow up

36:27.167 --> 36:30.536
was the biggest regret
of my life,

36:32.472 --> 36:36.808
(tearful) And I don't want to
make the same mistake again.

36:36.876 --> 36:38.743
Come on, come on.

36:47.686 --> 36:48.853
(Birds Twitter)

36:56.727 --> 36:58.395
Tons of potatoes
this year, huh?

37:00.265 --> 37:01.532
(Sighs) Yeah.

37:01.599 --> 37:03.600
Could open up
a chip wagon in town.

37:03.668 --> 37:07.104
Oh, I think you got better
things to do, don't ya?

37:07.172 --> 37:08.872
Probably.

37:08.940 --> 37:09.972
Peter:
(Sighs)

37:15.079 --> 37:17.113
About the discussion
we were having earlier.

37:17.181 --> 37:18.948
You know,
my job versus your job...

37:19.015 --> 37:20.183
Discussion?

37:20.250 --> 37:22.085
Whatever you wanna call it,
sweetheart.

37:22.152 --> 37:24.587
Can we just start over?

37:27.156 --> 37:28.290
Now that we're both
working full-time-

37:28.357 --> 37:29.558
and raising a baby.

37:29.625 --> 37:31.626
And raising a baby,
exactly,

37:31.694 --> 37:34.729
which is non-negotiable,
right?

37:34.797 --> 37:36.898
So we're gonna have
to hire a nanny.

37:36.966 --> 37:38.833
And we need to find
a place to live.

37:38.901 --> 37:40.768
I called a contractor
who swears up and down

37:40.836 --> 37:42.336
he's gonna be available
by the end of the week.

37:42.404 --> 37:43.670
I'll believe that
when I see it.

37:43.738 --> 37:44.905
Yeah, well,

37:44.973 --> 37:46.039
just like I'll believe
you hiring a nanny

37:46.108 --> 37:47.040
when I see it.

37:47.109 --> 37:49.343
Okay, I...

37:49.411 --> 37:51.445
There's some mothers
at the firm

37:51.513 --> 37:53.914
who are starting up
a workplace daycare.

37:53.982 --> 37:56.484
I could spend my lunch hours
with Katie,

37:56.551 --> 37:58.651
check in on her
when I get antsy.

37:58.719 --> 38:01.621
Yeah, you could set up
some cameras.

38:01.688 --> 38:03.055
Really.

38:03.124 --> 38:04.924
I could live stream her
directly to my office.

38:04.992 --> 38:06.826
(Chuckles)
You could do that.

38:06.893 --> 38:09.262
It sounds like a plan.

38:12.133 --> 38:13.965
Good.

38:14.033 --> 38:15.667
Jack: Hang in there.
You're gonna be fine.

38:15.735 --> 38:17.669
Woody: Yeah, your crazy old man
here made damn sure of it!

38:17.737 --> 38:19.738
Ty: (Grimaces) Please,
I need to talk to Amy.

38:19.805 --> 38:21.873
Paramedic: You need to
lie down and relax.

38:21.941 --> 38:24.075
Jack: So, uh, thank you
for all your trouble.

38:24.144 --> 38:25.511
I appreciate it.

38:25.578 --> 38:26.612
Oh, no, put it away.
I don't want your money.

38:26.679 --> 38:27.746
Come on.

38:27.813 --> 38:29.747
Honestly.
I'm happy to help.

38:29.814 --> 38:32.183
Well, then let me at least
pay for the window I broke.

38:32.251 --> 38:34.385
That wouldn't be fair.

38:34.453 --> 38:36.754
It's been like that
for years.

38:36.821 --> 38:38.422
Hey, good luck with that kid,
all right?

38:53.604 --> 38:54.837
(Tires crunch)

39:01.744 --> 39:03.479
Ty:

39:09.786 --> 39:10.852
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>What?</i>

39:10.920 --> 39:13.222
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Get outta the truck.</i>

39:14.524 --> 39:15.558
Okay.

39:23.666 --> 39:25.132
(Truck starts up)

39:39.880 --> 39:42.182
Let's just start
this again.

39:42.250 --> 39:45.352
This is me coming home alone...
to you.

39:49.889 --> 39:51.657
Amy:
(Laughs happily)

39:55.161 --> 39:56.061
Peter: Lou, give me the
keys, honey, I'll drive.

39:56.129 --> 39:57.096
Lou:
Okay. (Keys jingle)

39:57.163 --> 39:59.064
Amy, come on,
we gotta go!

40:00.100 --> 40:01.734
Grandpa, can I talk to Ty?

40:02.703 --> 40:04.303
Okay, just tell him
we're on our way, all right?

40:07.340 --> 40:09.641
Peter:
We'll be there in an hour.

40:10.610 --> 40:12.076
Amy: I told you
something was wrong.

40:12.144 --> 40:13.211
Lou: Yeah, don't forget
to give me a heads up

40:13.279 --> 40:15.247
next time you see a ghost.

40:18.377 --> 40:19.611
<i>(Truck rumbles)</i>

40:25.183 --> 40:27.051
(Truck rumbles loudly)

40:31.656 --> 40:34.191
You change the language,
change the perception, right?

40:34.259 --> 40:35.793
Yeah, tar sands
became the oil sands,

40:35.861 --> 40:37.561
oil sands becomes ethical oil.

40:37.629 --> 40:38.562
(Whispers)
Do you want a bagel?

40:38.630 --> 40:40.231
(Quietly) Yup.

40:40.298 --> 40:42.298
No, no, the only truly
ethical alternative

40:42.366 --> 40:44.000
to foreign oil, right?

40:44.969 --> 40:46.736
Yeah, okay, listen,
I'm on the 9:00 flight,

40:46.804 --> 40:49.739
so I'll catch up with you
over lunch, okay?

40:49.807 --> 40:51.775
Okay, Katie,
time to go and meet

40:51.842 --> 40:53.709
new friends
with dirty hands

40:53.778 --> 40:55.879
and runny noses,
and ear infections...

40:55.946 --> 40:57.212
Lou...

40:57.280 --> 40:58.446
I know, I've gotta be
positive, right?

40:58.514 --> 41:00.115
Birthday parties
and play dates and...

41:00.183 --> 41:02.217
And, uh,
Valentine's day cards!

41:02.285 --> 41:03.351
Okay, let's go.

41:03.419 --> 41:04.586
Peter:
Wait, wait, wait, honey.

41:04.654 --> 41:05.720
Lou:
We're gonna be late.

41:05.789 --> 41:06.721
Don't you have a flight
to catch?

41:06.790 --> 41:07.622
Peter:
Yes, I do, hold on.

41:07.690 --> 41:09.825
I, uh, I got you something.

41:09.893 --> 41:11.260
Should have given it
to you days ago.

41:11.327 --> 41:12.394
Here it is.

41:12.461 --> 41:13.727
Congratulations
on your promotion.

41:13.796 --> 41:14.728

41:15.998 --> 41:17.665
Oh!

<i>Peter:</i>
<i>There's only one charm on it,</i>

41:19.034 --> 41:20.367
but lots of room

just like our family.

41:22.171 --> 41:23.737
- I love it.
- Good.

41:24.973 --> 41:26.607
Isn't it pretty?
Yeah.

41:26.675 --> 41:27.809
Look how pretty.

41:30.679 --> 41:32.946
Woody: Figured you might be lookin'
for these sooner or later.

41:33.014 --> 41:34.181
Jack:
So...

41:34.248 --> 41:36.283
I borrowed this motorcycle.

41:37.251 --> 41:38.452
And to tell you the truth

41:38.520 --> 41:39.720
I haven't given the bikes
a second thought

41:39.788 --> 41:40.987
since the accident,

41:41.055 --> 41:42.323
but it's all Ty's been
talkin' about

41:42.390 --> 41:44.124
since he got out
of the hospital.

41:44.192 --> 41:45.758
Tim:
Wow, Jack,

41:45.826 --> 41:47.493
judging by that damage,

41:47.561 --> 41:48.961
things coulda been
a lot worse.

41:49.029 --> 41:50.930
How's that son
of yours doing?

41:50.997 --> 41:52.298
Oh, um,

41:52.366 --> 41:54.900
well, ruptured spleen
and lost a lot of blood.

41:54.968 --> 41:57.570
A little rest and some time,
he'll be good as new.

41:57.638 --> 41:59.639
And he's not my son.

41:59.707 --> 42:00.807
Really?

42:02.542 --> 42:04.909
I figured the way you were
lookin' after him...

42:04.977 --> 42:06.445
Took me until
I became a father

42:06.512 --> 42:08.079
to realize that a man'd do
anything for his son.

42:27.466 --> 42:29.600
You're not supposed
to be out of bed.

42:29.668 --> 42:30.835
I know.

42:30.902 --> 42:32.169
I just...
I thought I heard something.

42:33.838 --> 42:35.271
Whatever it was,
it's gone now.

42:38.909 --> 42:41.477
I guess I'm not much good
at layin' around.

42:41.544 --> 42:42.811
You know,
the only reason

42:42.880 --> 42:44.680
they let you outta
the hospital so soon

42:44.748 --> 42:47.250
was because I promised
that I would make sure

42:47.317 --> 42:49.285
you'd do nothing
but R&R

42:49.353 --> 42:50.920
until the doctor says
you're okay.

42:50.988 --> 42:53.022
Ty:
(Chuckles and grimaces)

42:53.090 --> 42:54.323
(Sighs)

42:54.391 --> 42:55.858
Ty and Amy:
(Chuckle)

42:55.925 --> 42:56.992
Here we are

42:57.059 --> 42:59.160
and all I wanna do
is sleep.

42:59.228 --> 43:01.696
Then that's what
you need to do.

43:01.764 --> 43:03.598
Amy, there's so much more
I want to say to you.

43:03.665 --> 43:04.699
And you will.

43:04.767 --> 43:06.067
When you're feeling better,

43:06.135 --> 43:07.502
we will have all the time
in the world to talk.

43:07.569 --> 43:09.905
That's what Jack said.

43:19.981 --> 43:21.848
I started wearing it
again.

43:21.917 --> 43:24.351
That's funny.

43:24.419 --> 43:25.819
When I gave that to you
I never really understood

43:25.887 --> 43:28.454
what I was promising,

43:28.522 --> 43:30.356
but I do now.

43:33.727 --> 43:36.429
You have got
to get some sleep.

43:36.496 --> 43:37.696
Okay?

43:38.565 --> 43:40.199
Ty: (Grimacing) Okay, careful.

43:40.267 --> 43:41.267
Both:
