WEBVTT

00:11.244 --> 00:12.939
Hey.

00:13.780 --> 00:15.611
Nicky. Whew.

00:15.782 --> 00:16.840
What's up, man?

00:17.584 --> 00:20.246
<i>Mommy and Daddy
won't let me watch Bad Boys.</i>

00:20.720 --> 00:22.153
<i>Bad Boys, huh?</i>

00:22.322 --> 00:24.256
What you gonna do?

00:25.825 --> 00:27.156
I know what I'm gonna do.

00:27.327 --> 00:29.261
I'm gonna run away from home.

00:29.729 --> 00:32.095
Oh, Nick. Man, come here.

00:32.265 --> 00:35.530
- You're running away from home?
- That's right. I'm out of here.

00:35.702 --> 00:38.865
Whoa, whoa. Hold on a second, there,
little traveling man.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.473
You running away from home,
you gonna need some food.

00:41.641 --> 00:44.132
You know, bums,
they don't like to share.

00:44.310 --> 00:45.800
Here you go, a little grub.

00:45.979 --> 00:52.384
And it gets a little chilly out in that night air
so you probably need a jacket and a hat.

00:52.552 --> 00:54.247
Yeah. Oh, you know.

00:54.421 --> 00:58.915
And here's a few bucks, you know,
in case something jump off out there.

00:59.092 --> 01:01.856
All right. You good to go, little bro.

01:04.030 --> 01:06.692
Aren't you gonna try and stop me?

01:06.866 --> 01:10.962
Try to stop you? No, man, with you gone
that's more food for me, you know.

01:11.137 --> 01:14.629
Plus, I get to keep your turtle
and that banging little bike you got.

01:14.808 --> 01:16.503
My turtle and my bike?

01:16.676 --> 01:18.803
I mean,
somebody gotta claim all that stuff.

01:19.546 --> 01:20.979
All right, I'll stay.

01:21.147 --> 01:23.012
But not because I'm scared.

01:23.183 --> 01:24.946
Not because you're taking my stuff.

01:25.118 --> 01:28.781
And not because of that reverse psychology
you tried to use on me.

01:29.355 --> 01:31.084
Well, then why you gonna stay?

01:31.257 --> 01:33.191
I'm 5, you dork.

Yee-ha!

02:52.539 --> 02:53.665
Giddyup, giddyup.

03:02.649 --> 03:05.277
Hey, come on, G. It's your turn.
Get on. Get on.

03:05.451 --> 03:06.748
Come on. Get on, G.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.911
G, just get on, man.

03:09.088 --> 03:11.579
Oh, what the heck.

03:13.159 --> 03:15.218
What, you some kind of freak, boy?

03:16.696 --> 03:19.187
Hey, G, we're going down
to the race track today, man.

03:19.365 --> 03:21.196
You wanna put a couple of ones
on a bet?

03:21.367 --> 03:25.770
Well, I'm not much of a gambler,
Master William, but since you're going...

03:25.939 --> 03:28.806
...back wheel the eighth with the one
on top of the two, three and six.

03:28.975 --> 03:32.206
And in the fifth, par tri the three eight
with the two and five.

03:33.379 --> 03:36.644
You got yourself a secret life going,
don't you, G?

03:37.250 --> 03:41.346
Will, which one do you think
your friend Frank will like best? This one?

03:41.521 --> 03:43.489
Or this one?

03:45.425 --> 03:48.792
God, I wanna get into the New York School
of Performing Arts so bad.

03:48.962 --> 03:52.398
Well, Ash, I don't think they pick
their students by what they're wearing.

03:53.333 --> 03:55.062
Do you think he'll recommend me?

03:55.235 --> 03:57.795
Not if you keep spinning around
like that, girl.

03:58.137 --> 03:59.331
Hey, everybody, look.

03:59.505 --> 04:02.372
Wednesday Bingo is running out
of post position five.

04:02.542 --> 04:04.066
Not post position five!

04:08.448 --> 04:09.972
That's his favorite position.

04:10.149 --> 04:13.050
It's the same position he had
when he won his first race.

04:13.219 --> 04:15.881
I still remember him standing
in that winner's circle...

04:16.055 --> 04:17.851
...Iooking up to me as if to say:

04:18.024 --> 04:21.221
"Tsk, tsk. This one's for you, little man."

04:22.962 --> 04:26.159
You sure his tail wasn't up in the air
at the time?

04:27.567 --> 04:31.469
Mom. Mommy, wish me luck. I really
wanna get into that school in New York.

04:31.638 --> 04:33.697
- Oh, good luck, honey.
- Thank you.

04:33.873 --> 04:35.204
New York.

04:35.375 --> 04:37.104
Isn't that a bit of a drive every morning?

04:39.312 --> 04:41.940
How cute, Daddy.
I'd have to live there, of course.

04:42.115 --> 04:45.949
Of course you would, muffin.
Of course, it's always been my dream...

04:46.119 --> 04:49.577
...to send my underage daughter
off to New York unsupervised.

04:49.756 --> 04:52.088
Isn't that every parent's dream?

04:52.625 --> 04:54.718
Daddy, you'll warm to the idea.

04:54.894 --> 04:58.762
Sweetheart, just remember
that the road to New York goes through me.

04:58.931 --> 05:01.866
What, that be like a six-lane highway?

05:05.238 --> 05:08.366
Well, Mom, you're okay with it, right?

05:08.541 --> 05:10.736
She feels the same way I do,
don't you, darling?

05:10.910 --> 05:13.174
There's plenty of time
to discuss this later.

05:13.346 --> 05:14.779
Huh?

05:15.081 --> 05:16.548
- Thanks, Mom.
Hey.

05:16.716 --> 05:19.207
You wanna make this first race?
We gotta go. Let's go.

05:19.385 --> 05:21.012
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.

05:21.187 --> 05:23.121
Have a good time.

05:23.289 --> 05:27.988
Vivian, if we don't stick together,
they'll win.

05:35.101 --> 05:39.128
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
five minutes to post time.</i>

05:39.305 --> 05:41.569
I'm so excited.
I just know I'm gonna win.

05:41.741 --> 05:43.333
I have a system that can't miss.

05:43.509 --> 05:44.533
Oh, yeah? What's that?

05:44.711 --> 05:47.111
I bet on every horse.

05:48.815 --> 05:50.646
Hilary, one of them has to win.

05:50.817 --> 05:54.480
I know and it doesn't matter which one.
Isn't it great?

05:55.922 --> 05:56.946
Where's Carlton?

05:57.623 --> 05:59.682
Oh, he's in the stables with the jockeys.

06:00.093 --> 06:02.493
He's never been the tallest person
in a room before.

06:04.464 --> 06:06.830
- Hey, Frank. Hey, what's up, man?
- Hey.

06:06.999 --> 06:08.591
Hey, thanks for these great seats.

06:08.768 --> 06:10.929
- Oh, this is my cousin, Hilary.
- Hi.

06:11.104 --> 06:12.833
And this is my cousin, Ashley.

06:13.005 --> 06:15.132
Oh, nice to meet you.
Will says you wanna go...

06:15.308 --> 06:18.209
...to the School for the Performing Arts.
- More than anything.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.243
That's where I learned to be a director.

06:20.413 --> 06:22.108
Really? You studied directing there?

06:22.281 --> 06:23.873
No, acting, but I sucked.

06:25.084 --> 06:27.678
My old acting partner is head
of the school now.

06:27.854 --> 06:31.722
- Guess he couldn't even direct, huh?
- Oh, you're smart. You should produce.

06:32.158 --> 06:34.683
Come by the office tomorrow.
We'll call him up.

06:34.861 --> 06:36.988
Oh, yeah. That'd be great.

06:37.163 --> 06:38.391
I'll be there at 7.

06:38.564 --> 06:41.658
I'll be there at noon.
Feel free to have a bagel while you wait.

06:45.004 --> 06:47.939
Some short stack told me
to get out of the paddock area.

06:48.107 --> 06:50.905
God, that feels great to say. Heh-heh.

06:51.077 --> 06:54.569
<i>They're at the gate.
The flag is up. And they're off.</i>

06:57.116 --> 07:00.882
<i>It's Rest Darling in front,
Daddy's Best, second and Lilac Lady, third.</i>

07:01.053 --> 07:04.682
I can feel it.
He's about to make his move.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.025
He ain't even leave the gate yet, man.

07:07.193 --> 07:09.661
Well, he's just psyching out
the other horses.

07:10.096 --> 07:12.155
<i>At the wire, it's Rest Darling by a nose.</i>

07:12.331 --> 07:14.390
<i>Lilac Lady, second
and Daddy's Best, third.</i>

07:14.567 --> 07:16.535
<i>Wednesday Bingo...</i>

07:16.702 --> 07:17.726
<i>... is taking a nap.</i>

07:19.739 --> 07:21.764
You just wait till he wakes up.

07:21.941 --> 07:23.602
Shoo!

07:31.083 --> 07:34.382
Will, Frank said he'd help me get
into the School of Performing Arts.

07:34.554 --> 07:35.816
Do you think he meant it?

07:35.988 --> 07:39.788
Ashley, how many times
do I have to tell you? Yes.

07:39.959 --> 07:42.291
No, no, no.
Really, Will, do you think he will?

07:42.462 --> 07:46.660
Ashley, the man is in show business,
he wouldn't lie.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.992
All right. All right. Look, he'll help you.

07:51.537 --> 07:53.562
Oh, look at him.

07:53.739 --> 07:56.503
He looks so sad.

07:56.909 --> 07:59.707
- Aww.
- Oh, he's so cute.

07:59.879 --> 08:03.838
Oh. Will, cheer him up. Sing him a song.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.914
Man, I ain't singing him no song.

08:07.086 --> 08:12.149
<i>The sun'll come out
Tomorrow</i>

08:12.325 --> 08:17.695
<i>Bet your bottom dollar
That tomorrow</i>

08:17.864 --> 08:19.456
<i>There'll be sun</i>

08:19.632 --> 08:22.795
I'm afraid the sun won't be coming out
tomorrow for that old boy.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.394
What do you mean?

08:24.570 --> 08:27.835
Too many years. Too many races.
The owner wants me to put him down.

08:28.274 --> 08:29.298
When?

08:29.475 --> 08:31.204
Tomorrow.

08:32.912 --> 08:38.248
<i>It's only a day away</i>

08:42.554 --> 08:46.150
Oh. And this was when he
was just a yearling.

08:46.325 --> 08:49.260
Oh, and look, this is when he won
his first race. Look, Will.

08:49.428 --> 08:53.728
Carlton, I ain't trying to be looking
at that horse all day, man.

08:53.900 --> 08:57.301
Now, look, just watch some TV
and take your mind off of it, all right?

08:57.470 --> 08:58.767
<i>Hello.</i>

08:58.938 --> 09:01.133
<i>I'm Mister Ed.</i>

09:02.775 --> 09:05.437
You bastard!

09:08.748 --> 09:10.807
Wow, Carlton seems pretty upset.

09:12.118 --> 09:14.882
I think what he needs
is a refreshing pick-me-up beverage...

09:15.054 --> 09:18.217
...that's not too sweet
and not too heavy.

09:19.191 --> 09:20.215
What?

09:20.393 --> 09:21.485
You know my motto.

09:21.661 --> 09:24.721
If you're a woman on the go like me,
things can get rough.

09:24.897 --> 09:28.264
And when they do, don't sweat,
drink Jet.

09:28.434 --> 09:30.834
Jet cola that is.

09:31.971 --> 09:35.134
Oh, my God.
You been sipping that gin and juice.

09:36.576 --> 09:37.838
Hi, guys.

09:38.010 --> 09:40.308
Oh, Ashley, look.

09:40.479 --> 09:43.209
Now eat these mints
and whatever you do, don't talk. Here.

09:43.382 --> 09:44.940
I don't need a mint.

09:45.117 --> 09:48.746
Mom, I went to see Mr. Roberts about
the High School of the Performing Arts...

09:48.921 --> 09:51.389
...and he offered me a commercial
for Jet cola.

09:51.557 --> 09:54.788
- Oh, that's great! Let's go tell your dad.
- Okay.

09:57.730 --> 10:00.290
This don't seem that hard.

10:02.001 --> 10:03.332
You know my motto.

10:03.502 --> 10:06.528
If you're a woman on the go like me,
things can get rough.

10:06.706 --> 10:08.537
And when they do, don't sweat, y'all.

10:08.708 --> 10:09.766
Drink Jet.

10:09.942 --> 10:11.136
Jet cola that is.

10:12.778 --> 10:14.803
Well, then, be a woman on the go.

10:14.981 --> 10:17.711
Leave so I can vacuum.

10:24.023 --> 10:26.617
- Hey, Frank, what's up, man?
- Hi, Will. How's it going?

10:26.792 --> 10:29.090
All right.
I'm just coming down, check on Ashley.

10:29.261 --> 10:32.788
- She's a little nervous before her first shoot.
- She's gonna be just fine.

10:32.965 --> 10:35.024
Okay, girls. Places, please. Let's go.

10:37.069 --> 10:38.400
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

10:38.571 --> 10:41.335
You mean, you just say it and they do it?

10:42.475 --> 10:44.500
Okay, girls...

10:44.677 --> 10:45.974
...get naked.

10:48.648 --> 10:51.640
Uh... Simon says, get naked.

10:52.551 --> 10:55.952
Okay, people. First positions, please.
We're losing the light.

10:56.122 --> 10:57.851
Let's get this rolling.

10:58.024 --> 11:01.892
Hey, Frank. I got to tell you, man,
it's guys like you make life worth living.

11:02.061 --> 11:06.088
Bringing all these beautiful women to us
during all our favorite programs.

11:06.265 --> 11:09.598
Mm. Man, you ought to have a billboard
with your face on it. You ought to...

11:11.437 --> 11:14.304
...be ashamed of yourself!

11:14.573 --> 11:16.507
Will. Will.

11:17.643 --> 11:19.406
- That's a wrap!
- I am so sorry.

11:23.983 --> 11:26.918
There is no way I'm gonna let her
parade around on some beach...

11:27.086 --> 11:29.987
...hawking Jet cola
in nothing but a skimpy bikini.

11:30.156 --> 11:33.319
And showing that can
all over national TV.

11:33.926 --> 11:36.053
And I ain't talking about the soda.

11:37.763 --> 11:39.230
Carlton, this is crazy.

11:39.398 --> 11:40.797
Hilary, we had no choice.

11:40.966 --> 11:43.526
We needed a place
till we find him a permanent home.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.934
What's gonna happen if Dad finds out
there's a horse in the back yard?

11:47.406 --> 11:49.601
He'll blame Will like he always does.

11:50.476 --> 11:51.568
Oh, okay.

11:55.114 --> 11:57.674
- Hi, Daddy.
- Don't you "hi, Daddy" me.

11:57.850 --> 12:02.150
Just when were you planning on telling me
about your little soft-core drink commercial?

12:03.389 --> 12:05.084
You.

12:07.059 --> 12:08.993
We would've found out eventually.

12:09.161 --> 12:12.028
Yeah, even though they're not showing
that much of her face.

12:14.066 --> 12:15.465
I don't believe this.

12:15.634 --> 12:17.295
You're both being hypocrites.

12:17.470 --> 12:21.463
<i>You sit there glued to the set
anytime Baywatch comes on.</i>

12:26.078 --> 12:28.308
That's only because
I have trouble sleeping...

12:28.481 --> 12:32.315
...and the sound of the waves
gently caressing the shore helps relax me.

12:33.352 --> 12:35.286
Nice cover. Nice cov...

12:35.721 --> 12:38.212
Ashley, you're not doing this commercial.

12:41.494 --> 12:43.394
Mom, can you talk to him?

12:43.562 --> 12:46.622
I'm afraid your father feels very strongly
about this.

12:49.034 --> 12:51.332
I just can't quit the commercial.

12:51.504 --> 12:55.235
How's it look if I walk out on the person
who's gonna give me the recommendation?

12:55.407 --> 12:56.704
I don't care.

12:56.876 --> 12:58.104
This is more important.

12:58.277 --> 13:00.643
And you're not going to New York,
either.

13:01.080 --> 13:02.570
What about what I want?

13:02.748 --> 13:03.772
Doesn't that matter?

13:04.550 --> 13:06.074
No.

13:16.162 --> 13:18.562
No, no, whoa. I am telling you, Uncle Phil,
I was there...

13:18.731 --> 13:24.499
...and that commercial was nothing
but a disgusting, gratuitous display of...

13:24.670 --> 13:26.137
Just call it what it is.

13:26.305 --> 13:27.795
Smut.

13:27.973 --> 13:30.840
- You don't think I was too rough on Ashley?
- Are you tripping?

13:31.010 --> 13:33.444
You are the leader of the pack.
It is your right.

13:33.612 --> 13:35.580
No, no, no. Scratch that.

13:35.748 --> 13:39.684
It is your duty as a male
to assert your dominance.

13:39.852 --> 13:42.320
There, I said it, your dominance.

13:42.488 --> 13:46.049
Really? Because your Aunt Vivian
wasn't as supportive of my approach.

13:46.592 --> 13:50.084
Your approach? Man, I got one thing
to say about your approach:

13:50.262 --> 13:53.322
Woof, woof, woof.

13:53.966 --> 13:55.866
You are the king of the jungle, Mufasa.

13:56.035 --> 13:58.299
Yes, I am. Yes, I am.

13:58.470 --> 14:01.997
- You are the ruler of all that you survey.
- Yes.

14:02.174 --> 14:04.972
- You will be obeyed!
- I will be obeyed!

14:05.144 --> 14:08.477
- That's right.
- Yes. Hi, sweetie, you look awfully pretty.

14:10.783 --> 14:13.217
Well, I guess I showed her.

14:13.719 --> 14:15.778
You ain't nothing but Simba.

14:23.062 --> 14:24.757
What's up, Ash?

14:27.399 --> 14:29.390
What you watching?

14:32.204 --> 14:36.140
You know, I have no idea
what got into the big guy!

14:37.243 --> 14:38.369
You got into him.

14:38.544 --> 14:40.603
- You're the rat that dimed me out.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:41.247 --> 14:44.808
Wait a minute, Ashley. Now that hurts.
I'm offended by that characterization.

14:44.984 --> 14:46.918
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:47.086 --> 14:49.577
You don't like rat. How about snake?

14:49.755 --> 14:51.450
Weasel?

14:51.790 --> 14:53.553
Doody-head?

14:54.493 --> 14:56.961
Don't be calling me no doody-head.

14:57.563 --> 15:00.657
You know how much going to the School
of Performing Arts means to me...

15:00.833 --> 15:02.801
...and how much that commercial
would help.

15:02.968 --> 15:05.334
That commercial was degrading.

15:05.504 --> 15:08.268
Oh, really? It was?

15:08.440 --> 15:11.932
Which part? The part where
I'm in clothes driving the car?

15:12.111 --> 15:14.375
The part where I'm in sweats
drinking the cola?

15:14.546 --> 15:16.309
The part where I'm Rollerblading? No.

15:16.482 --> 15:20.418
All you focused on were the seven seconds
I was in a bathing suit playing volleyball.

15:20.586 --> 15:25.250
I play volleyball in a bathing suit
all the time. Am I degrading myself?

15:26.558 --> 15:28.549
I didn't know about all them other parts.

15:29.828 --> 15:32.422
Exactly. Because you didn't ask.

15:32.598 --> 15:36.534
All that mattered to you and Dad
was your narrow-minded maleness.

15:36.702 --> 15:40.468
You know,
this job may not be my dream job...

15:40.806 --> 15:43.206
...but, regardless, it's my dream.

15:43.375 --> 15:45.206
You and Dad have nothing to do with it.

15:45.377 --> 15:46.844
You know what?

15:47.012 --> 15:48.877
I should just go and do it anyway.

15:49.048 --> 15:51.676
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait. Wait a minute.

15:51.850 --> 15:55.445
Now... Now, I realize you're excited
and you're a little upset...

15:55.621 --> 15:58.283
...but Uncle Phil is a big man.

15:59.391 --> 16:02.053
He's a very big man...

16:02.528 --> 16:05.224
...with a very short fuse.

16:05.397 --> 16:06.694
Bad combination.

16:08.033 --> 16:10.331
Very bad combination.

16:11.003 --> 16:12.527
Goodbye.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.174
Bad talk.

16:17.343 --> 16:20.073
Very bad talk.

16:24.450 --> 16:25.678
Here you go.

16:25.851 --> 16:30.288
Nick, have I ever kept you
from achieving your dreams?

16:31.657 --> 16:32.851
Not many.

16:33.926 --> 16:37.327
I mean, you wouldn't call me
narrow-minded, would you?

16:37.763 --> 16:39.355
You just don't get it, do you?

16:39.531 --> 16:41.556
I'm 5, you dork.

16:43.936 --> 16:47.235
Yeah, you're right. I should just be talking
to Ashley. Is she here?

16:47.406 --> 16:49.966
Nope. She's at the commercial.

16:50.142 --> 16:51.575
- What?
- What? Whoa! Ha-ha-ha!

16:51.744 --> 16:53.268
Hey.

16:53.445 --> 16:56.812
Well, Uncle Phil, man.
How long you been standing there?

16:56.982 --> 16:59.507
You know, you're a light stepper
for a big fella.

17:01.153 --> 17:02.677
What did you just say, Nicky?

17:02.855 --> 17:05.186
Ashley's at the commercial.

17:05.357 --> 17:07.551
Oh, how could she do this, huh?

17:07.726 --> 17:10.752
In direct defiance of...

17:10.929 --> 17:13.295
The king of the jungle?

17:14.233 --> 17:16.201
We'll see about this.

17:16.367 --> 17:20.464
What? Now, Uncle Phil, calm down, man.
All right? It ain't that serious.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.704
Big man, short fuse.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.401
Bad combination.

17:30.182 --> 17:33.618
- Well, she's not here, Uncle Phil. Let's go.
- We just got here.

17:34.153 --> 17:37.179
Well, you know, Uncle Phil,
as I look around...

17:37.356 --> 17:42.589
...you know, the level of nakedness
isn't as high as I had previously assumed.

17:45.697 --> 17:50.361
Will, you know, ever since we've left
the house you seemed a little distracted.

17:50.536 --> 17:52.902
You know, what ever happened to that:
Woof, woof, woof.

17:53.238 --> 17:55.672
Oh, heh. Well, that's still there, man.

17:55.841 --> 17:57.331
Woof, woof, woof.

17:58.544 --> 18:01.980
You know, Uncle Phil,
I don't even think that Ashley's here!

18:02.147 --> 18:03.341
Ashley.

18:03.515 --> 18:06.450
Daddy, what are you doing here?

18:06.618 --> 18:07.778
What am I doing here?

18:07.953 --> 18:10.183
What are you doing here? You defied me.

18:10.355 --> 18:13.119
Now, you go get your clothes
and you come with me right now.

18:13.559 --> 18:15.220
- Daddy, l...
- I don't wanna hear it.

18:15.394 --> 18:19.228
Coming down here and doing this
commercial after I expressly forbade it.

18:20.032 --> 18:22.159
I just quit the commercial.

18:24.336 --> 18:25.928
Well... Uh...

18:30.275 --> 18:32.743
You should be ashamed of yourself.

18:33.245 --> 18:34.712
Not trusting Ashley.

18:34.880 --> 18:37.815
I knew she would never do it.
Mama knows, child. Come here.

18:37.983 --> 18:39.143
Shut up, Will.

18:41.353 --> 18:43.378
Listen, I'm taking over.

18:43.555 --> 18:45.853
I need to know where your wardrobe is.

18:46.425 --> 18:49.417
Um, it's in the dressing room in the back.

18:50.596 --> 18:53.394
Too bad your daddy won't let you
do the commercial.

18:53.565 --> 18:55.396
Better off leaving it to the big girls.

18:56.001 --> 18:58.401
Whoo-hoo-hoo. Whoo-hoo.

18:58.570 --> 19:00.470
Little cat in you, huh, girl?

19:00.639 --> 19:01.970
Little leopard skirt on.

19:04.743 --> 19:06.040
You know, let's just go.

19:07.379 --> 19:10.780
<i>Yep. You better make it home
before Saved by the Bell starts.</i>

19:11.550 --> 19:14.144
Excuse me, miss.

19:14.319 --> 19:16.412
No one talks to my daughter
that way.

19:16.955 --> 19:20.891
So maybe you and your little
horsehair weave should just mosey on...

19:22.561 --> 19:24.188
...before I get really upset.

19:24.696 --> 19:28.291
Better some horsehair
than some no hair.

19:28.734 --> 19:29.996
Wait. I don't think so.

19:30.169 --> 19:33.935
- Oh, no. Ashley. Ashley. Ashley.
- It ain't worth it. It ain't worth it.

19:34.106 --> 19:37.906
Sweetheart, you go to your dressing room
and put on your costume.

19:38.076 --> 19:42.206
Because I think Frank's gonna need
some class to sell his drink.

19:42.514 --> 19:44.573
Daddy,
you're gonna let me do the commercial?

19:44.750 --> 19:49.881
- It's up to you if you want to.
- Oh, Daddy, thank you. Ha-ha. Oh.

19:50.289 --> 19:53.520
And, by the way, your mother.

19:56.094 --> 19:59.962
Mama. It's "mama," Ashley. Mama.
It's "your mama."

20:03.869 --> 20:06.099
Hey, Ashley, I gotta tell you.

20:06.271 --> 20:08.831
I think this commercial thing
is gonna be all right.

20:09.007 --> 20:11.168
You know,
all them new friends you made today.

20:11.343 --> 20:13.208
How you got all their telephone numbers.

20:13.378 --> 20:17.075
That was cool.
I'll give you $20 apiece for each of them.

20:17.583 --> 20:20.677
Hey, except for that cat girl.
She had a beard.

20:22.287 --> 20:25.984
Daddy, did you hear? Frank said I'm
a shoo-in for the School of Performing Arts.

20:26.158 --> 20:27.591
I'm as good as in New York.

20:27.759 --> 20:29.886
I've said it before and I'll say it again.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.826
No, no, no.

20:33.398 --> 20:35.389
What happened
to you being more open-minded?

20:35.567 --> 20:36.932
I am open-minded, sweetheart.

20:37.102 --> 20:40.538
And any commercial you wanna shoot here
in the greater Los Angeles area...

20:40.706 --> 20:42.606
...hey, I'm on board.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.337
Will, what do you think?

20:44.509 --> 20:47.535
Hey, I have nothing but love and respect
for the both of you.

20:50.115 --> 20:54.381
Oh, Mom. Come on. Can you convince Dad
it's all right for me to move to New York?

20:54.553 --> 20:57.021
Tell her she is too young
to move anywhere.

20:57.589 --> 20:59.750
I moved out of the horse when I was 17.

21:01.193 --> 21:02.683
Horse?

21:02.861 --> 21:06.353
House. Um... I gotta go do this thing with...
Uh... Bye.

21:06.531 --> 21:09.364
No, no. Wait. Mom, I gotta talk to you.

21:10.335 --> 21:14.135
- Hmm. She's acting oddly.
- Yeah.

21:18.510 --> 21:21.240
Want me to get you some Pepto-Bismol,
Uncle Phil?

21:26.818 --> 21:29.013
- Wednesday Bingo, get up.
- Get up off the couch.

21:29.187 --> 21:30.245
Please. Come on.

21:30.422 --> 21:34.290
- Get up, Wednesday Bingo. Get up, please.
- You can't stay here.

21:36.361 --> 21:38.420
- They were gonna kill him.
- And we saved him.

21:38.597 --> 21:40.690
- We needed to find a farm.
- We found one but...

21:40.866 --> 21:44.802
- He doesn't wanna go.
- And it's hard to move this kind of girth.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.938
You can relate to that, Uncle Phil.

21:49.174 --> 21:51.039
- We can explain.
- We can explain.

21:51.209 --> 21:52.574
- He did it.
- He did it.

21:52.744 --> 21:54.974
What? Hey.
