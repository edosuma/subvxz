00:07.708 --> 00:12.183
I KNOW I INVITED YOU
OVER TO STUDY, BUT...

00:12.183 --> 00:14.685
I THINK WE BOTH KNOW
THE TEST WAS YESTERDAY.

00:14.685 --> 00:16.387
ISN'T THE TEST TOMORROW?

00:16.387 --> 00:17.648
SHH.

00:17.648 --> 00:19.690
Stan: THIS IS TYLER JAMES.

00:19.690 --> 00:23.694
NOW THAT IS THE FACE
OF A SMOOTH PLAYER.

00:23.694 --> 00:26.497
WELL, NOT THAT FACE.

00:26.497 --> 00:29.500

TYLER'S STEPSISTER.

00:41.212 --> 00:43.214
UH, KIND OF
A PSYCHO ABOUT RULES.

00:43.214 --> 00:45.076
SHE EVEN HAS A RULE
ABOUT NOT INTERRUPTING HER,

00:45.076 --> 00:46.517
SO LET'S KEEP IT MOVING.

00:46.517 --> 00:49.480
...OUT OF HERE,
OR I'M GONNA TELL EVERYONE
YOU'RE WEARING A WIG.

00:49.480 --> 00:51.322
I'M NOT WEARING A WIG.

00:51.322 --> 00:53.824
OW! I TOLD YOU,
IT'S NOT A WIG!

00:53.824 --> 00:56.257
I KNOW, BUT THAT HURT, RIGHT?

00:56.257 --> 00:58.259
WOULD YOU JUST
GET OUT OF HERE?

00:58.259 --> 01:01.532
THIS IS MY HOUSE.
YOU AND YOUR MOM HAVE ONLY
BEEN HERE FOR, LIKE, A YEAR.

01:01.532 --> 01:05.266
ELEVEN MONTHS, FOURTEEN DAYS,
SIX HOURS, TEN MINUTES,

A PLUS B EQUALS
"WHY SHOULD I CARE?"

01:17.408 --> 01:19.580

OKAY, YOU TWO CONTINUE THIS
HIGH-LEVEL EXCHANGE OF IDEAS...

ON TUESDAY.

01:27.488 --> 01:30.321
TUESDAY? NO WAY.

01:30.321 --> 01:33.324
THE CHEERLEADERS ARE COMING OVER
TO AUDITION FOR MY SHOW.

01:33.324 --> 01:35.826
DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT WAS
TO CONVINCE THEM THAT

01:35.826 --> 01:39.670
I'M DIRECTING A NEW PLAY
CALLED HOMESCHOOL MUSICAL?

01:39.670 --> 01:42.403
DO THAT AGAIN!
I HEARD THE OCEAN!

01:43.704 --> 01:46.677
WAS IT REALLY THAT HARD

WHO SMELLS LIKE PIZZA DOUGH.

01:58.519 --> 02:00.521
SOUNDS LIKE A STORM!

02:02.223 --> 02:05.125
LOOK, MY MEETING
IS HAPPENING.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.598
IT'S THE FIRST TIME
I'LL GET TO HAVE FRIENDS OVER

02:07.598 --> 02:10.861
SINCE MY MOM MARRIED YOUR DAD
AND RUINED MY LIFE.

02:10.861 --> 02:13.133
YOUR LIFE IS RUINED?
SINCE YOU MOVED IN,

02:13.133 --> 02:15.135
THERE ARE SIGN UP SHEETS
EVERYWHERE.

02:15.135 --> 02:18.409

EVERY DAY AT 8:00 AND 4:30.
WHAT IS SO DIFFICULT?

02:22.343 --> 02:24.675
( both continue arguing )

02:24.675 --> 02:28.679
I KNOW YOU SAID BE PATIENT
AND EVENTUALLY WE'D COME
TOGETHER AS A REAL FAMILY,

02:28.679 --> 02:31.352
BUT THOSE TWO
WILL NOT STOP GOING AT IT!

02:31.352 --> 02:33.324
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.
I'M GONNA GO IN THERE
AND SET THEM STRAIGHT.

02:39.390 --> 02:41.532
HONEY, WE HAVE BEEN OVER THIS.

02:41.532 --> 02:43.894
INTERVENING AT THIS POINT
WOULD NOT BE A GOOD IDEA.

Both: SIBLINGS MUST
DEVELOP THEIR OWN TOOLS
FOR CONFLICT RESOLUTION.

02:48.569 --> 02:51.472
IT'S ALL HERE IN
THE FOREMOST GUIDE
TO PARENTING,

02:51.472 --> 02:55.776

ARE MESSED UP,

03:04.355 --> 03:05.686
BUT SHE'S DOING OKAY.

03:05.686 --> 03:08.519
THERE'S A MONSTER CHASING ME!

03:08.519 --> 03:11.191
I SAID "OKAY," NOT "GREAT."

03:12.593 --> 03:15.766
UM, CHLOE, SWEETIE, LISTEN...

04:00.841 --> 04:02.913
I DIDN'T SAY "NEVER."

04:02.913 --> 04:06.977
I SAID "NEVER-WEVER"
BECAUSE YOU WERE THREE

HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER

DO SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS ON YOU.

MY WHOLE LIFE FOR THIS.

I'M FINALLY PART OF A FAMILY.

10:10.941 --> 10:13.644
NO, BUT WE JUST CAN'T LET
MOM AND DAD FIND OUT.

10:13.644 --> 10:15.816
I MEAN, DAD WOULD WRITE
A BOOK ABOUT IT,

10:15.816 --> 10:19.790
MOM WOULD FREAK,
AND DAD WOULD WRITE A BOOK
ABOUT MOM FREAKING.

10:19.790 --> 10:21.922
THERE'D BE FREAKING BOOKS
EVERYWHERE!

CHLOE, YOU'VE GOT
AN ACTIVE IMAGINATION!

10:50.650 --> 10:52.923
NO, HE TALKS
LIKE A PERSON!

10:52.923 --> 10:55.986
HE SAID, "LET'S GET

HONEY, I LOVE YOU,
I RESPECT YOU.

11:10.801 --> 11:13.303

ONLY AS A SUPPORTIVE WIFE--

11:13.303 --> 11:15.746
DID YOU GET YOUR PhD ONLINE?

11:19.309 --> 11:20.981
MAN, CHLOE
ALMOST BLEW IT FOR US.

11:20.981 --> 11:23.683
GOOD THING NO ONE

11:23.683 --> 11:24.985
SHE'S SIX.

11:24.985 --> 11:27.818
ALL RIGHT, I JUST DON'T GET
HOW YOU PEOPLE COUNT YEARS.

11:27.818 --> 11:31.261
LOOK, THE IMPORTANT THING IS
THAT YOUR SECRET IS STILL SAFE.

11:31.261 --> 11:33.363
OH, I COULDN'T BEAR
TO LOSE YOU, BUDDY.

11:33.363 --> 11:37.728
AW, THAT'S REAL NICE.
OH, BUT DON'T SQUEEZE TOO HARD,
I JUST DRANK A LOT OF WATER.

11:37.728 --> 11:40.270

I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
EITHER I GET THE FAMILY ROOM
TONIGHT FOR MY CHEERLEADERS,

11:47.738 --> 11:50.911
OR I TELL DAD STAN CAN TALK
AND CHLOE'S NOT A WACKO.

11:50.911 --> 11:53.844
WHERE'S MY PONY?!

11:53.844 --> 11:55.715
YOU WOULDN'T TELL DAD
STAN CAN TALK.

11:55.715 --> 12:00.991

COMING OVER. YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'M CAPABLE OF.

12:00.991 --> 12:03.894

THAT DUMB LOOK ON YOUR FACE.

12:03.894 --> 12:08.959

I ALWAYS HAVE THIS DUMB LOOK
ON MY FACE.

12:08.959 --> 12:12.963

THEY'LL DO EXPERIMENTS ON STAN
AND WE'LL LOSE HIM.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.869

13:02.482 --> 13:04.214
AND NOW THERE'S NOT TALKING DOG.

13:04.214 --> 13:06.987

CARES ABOUT ANYONE.

13:08.418 --> 13:11.461

TALKING ANIMALS ARE HAPPY!

13:15.325 --> 13:19.399

13:19.399 --> 13:21.571

I WAS A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY,

13:21.571 --> 13:23.433
AND I FELL FOR IT.

13:23.433 --> 13:26.406
BUT THEY'RE JUST LIKE
ALL THE OTHERS, SO I BOLTED.

13:26.406 --> 13:29.279
ORIGINALLY I WAS JUST
GOING OUTSIDE TO CHILL,

13:29.279 --> 13:31.581

AND I CHASED IT!

13:31.581 --> 13:35.315

13:38.118 --> 13:40.120
HE DID THIS.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.996
I CAN'T BELIEVE STAN RAN AWAY.

13:45.996 --> 13:47.958
HE MUST HAVE HEARD
WHAT WE WERE SAYING.

13:47.958 --> 13:50.460
YOU KNOW,
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.

13:50.460 --> 13:52.202
YOU SAID
YOU WERE GONNA TELL DAD.

13:52.202 --> 13:53.533
YOU SAID HE WAS A STUPID DOG.

13:53.533 --> 13:56.366
I ONLY SAID THAT BECAUSE YOU
WERE TRYING TO MANIPULATE ME.

13:56.366 --> 13:58.038
I'VE LIVED IN THIS HOUSE
FOR A YEAR NOW,

13:58.038 --> 14:00.370
AND YOU'VE DONE NOTHING
TO ACT LIKE A BROTHER TO ME.

14:00.370 --> 14:03.273
AND NOW YOU'VE
DRIVEN AWAY THE ONE THING
THAT I CARED ABOUT MOST.

14:03.273 --> 14:04.574
( crying )

14:04.574 --> 14:07.847

14:09.349 --> 14:12.282
I'LL TELL DAD AND HE CAN
DRIVE US AROUND AND THEN--

14:12.282 --> 14:13.954
NO, YOU HEARD WHAT THEY SAID.

14:13.954 --> 14:17.027
IF WE CAN'T TAKE CARE OF HIM,
WE CAN'T KEEP HIM.

14:17.027 --> 14:18.889
IT'S OBVIOUS
WHAT WE HAVE TO DO.

14:18.889 --> 14:23.533
FIND ANOTHER DOG
THAT LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE STAN
AND TEACH HIM HOW TO TALK.

14:23.533 --> 14:26.866
NO. WE HAVE
TO FIND HIM OURSELVES.

14:26.866 --> 14:30.000
OKAY, IF YOU WANNA
DO IT THE HARD WAY.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.642

A RUNAWAY DOG WIND UP?

14:32.642 --> 14:34.444

HEY, DON'T TALK AT THE SAME TIME

THE $500 IN DAMAGES HE CAUSED.
