WEBVTT

00:09.443 --> 00:13.214
*

00:13.247 --> 00:17.418
* I'm walking
on the southern street *

00:17.451 --> 00:20.721
* Cut to the river
'fore I run too low *

00:20.754 --> 00:25.493
* I'm walking
on the southern street *

00:25.526 --> 00:29.029
* Cut to the river
'fore I run too low *

00:37.538 --> 00:41.242
* Old gypsy woman spoke to me

00:41.275 --> 00:45.113
* Said, "You're a wolf, boy,
get out of this town" *

00:45.146 --> 00:48.616
* Old gypsy woman spoke to me

00:48.649 --> 00:52.153
* Said, "You're a wolf, boy,
get out of this town" *

00:53.587 --> 00:57.225
* "You're a wolf, boy,
get out of this town" *

00:57.258 --> 00:58.259
(gunshots, screaming)

00:58.292 --> 01:00.694
*"You're a wolf, boy, get out of
this town" *

01:00.728 --> 01:02.563
* "You're a wolf."

01:07.401 --> 01:09.170
So, wideband

01:09.203 --> 01:10.704
mixer-circulator
retro-reflector.

01:10.738 --> 01:12.273
Obviously not.

01:12.306 --> 01:13.407
Obviously.

01:13.441 --> 01:15.776
How about
ternary computing?

01:15.809 --> 01:18.512
- Nah.
- No.

01:18.546 --> 01:21.382
Nanometer fabrication using
sacrificial spacer layers.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.217
- Nah...
- You've got to be kidding me.

01:23.251 --> 01:24.185
Nanometer fabrication!

01:24.218 --> 01:27.121
Hey, nobody kids
about nanometer fabrication.

01:27.155 --> 01:29.257
(laughs) You guys still
going through

01:29.290 --> 01:30.358
Cal Sci's consulting projects?

01:30.391 --> 01:31.559
Oh, yeah.

01:31.592 --> 01:32.760
My NSA clearance
is suspended,

01:32.793 --> 01:35.396
so, all really get to
do now is... look.

01:35.429 --> 01:37.231
My next paper's going
to be titled

01:37.265 --> 01:38.499
"Our Friend the Triangle."

01:38.532 --> 01:39.800
Actually, John Conway
and Steven Sigur

01:39.833 --> 01:41.569
already wrote a great book
about that subject.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.371
LARRY:
You know, it is surprising

01:43.404 --> 01:45.439
to see how much of our work
actually intersects

01:45.473 --> 01:46.707
with top-secret
government research.

01:46.740 --> 01:48.876
You know, Cal Sci
has even limited

01:48.909 --> 01:50.778
his access to the
supercomputers.

01:50.811 --> 01:52.380
ALAN:
Am I going to sound too much

01:52.413 --> 01:54.315
like your father, Charlie,
when I suggest that, um,

01:54.348 --> 01:55.115
after time for principle,

01:55.149 --> 01:57.385
there be occasion
for a strategic,

01:57.418 --> 02:00.388
insincere apology?

02:00.421 --> 02:02.290
I wish it were that simple, Dad.

02:02.323 --> 02:05.693
I... I have to petition to get
my security clearance back.

02:05.726 --> 02:06.927
Step one of that

02:06.960 --> 02:09.263
is an interview
tomorrow at the FBI,

02:09.297 --> 02:11.332
with someone called
a security officer.

02:11.365 --> 02:12.800
AMITA: Charlie, you do have a
connection

02:12.833 --> 02:14.535
or two at the FBI.

02:14.568 --> 02:16.404
I don't want
to drag Don into this one.

02:16.437 --> 02:17.538
The facts are on my side.

02:17.571 --> 02:19.540
None of the information
I sent to Pakistan was a threat

02:19.573 --> 02:20.508
to national security.

02:20.541 --> 02:22.243
ALAN: Listen, Charlie, when
you're dealing

02:22.276 --> 02:23.477
with the government,
it doesn't hurt

02:23.511 --> 02:25.579
to have more than just the facts
on your side.

02:27.681 --> 02:29.250
(siren whooping,
indistinct chatter)

02:29.283 --> 02:30.518
What do you say, Nikki?

02:30.551 --> 02:32.920
Alice DeMaire, 33.

02:32.953 --> 02:36.290
An I.T. worker at a small day
trader office off Figueroa.

02:36.324 --> 02:38.826
Two in the back--
a .38 or a nine.

02:38.859 --> 02:41.429
Oh, yeah? The lab boys
been here?

02:41.462 --> 02:42.963
No, but I know
bullet holes.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.266
Yeah, perp was described
as male, white, 30s,

02:45.299 --> 02:46.467
dark suit and
sunglasses.

02:46.500 --> 02:47.535
Fled in a brown truck.

02:47.568 --> 02:49.937
And the witnesses say, a
flower truck, bread truck.

02:49.970 --> 02:51.339
You know, like that.

02:51.372 --> 02:52.340
So it was stolen, right?

02:52.373 --> 02:54.842
Unless we're looking at
a gang of rogue bakers.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.944
ATM is this way.

02:56.977 --> 02:59.980
NIKKI: You know you're not in
East L.A. when $20 bills

03:00.013 --> 03:02.316
hit the ground
and stay there.

03:02.350 --> 03:03.183
What do you
say, Colb?

03:03.217 --> 03:05.753
This is our best photo
of the shooter.

03:05.786 --> 03:08.422
He slid back
in line twice.

03:08.456 --> 03:09.357
Staying out
of camera?

03:09.390 --> 03:11.459
This guy might have known
where to stand,

03:11.492 --> 03:14.428
but he wasn't so careful
about where he ran.

03:14.462 --> 03:15.329
Parking garage right here

03:15.363 --> 03:16.497
has a camera pointed
toward the street.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.366
Give that to LAPD?

03:18.399 --> 03:19.900
- Yeah, ten minutes ago.
- NIKKI: New guy question.

03:19.933 --> 03:21.435
But what are we
doing here?

03:21.469 --> 03:22.936
I mean, this seems
like a straight-up LAPD shoot.

03:22.970 --> 03:23.937
DON: You got a woman who's

03:23.971 --> 03:25.906
kidnapped 23 hours ago,
and her husband was told

03:25.939 --> 03:27.508
to make sure he has $3,000

03:27.541 --> 03:28.876
in his bank account.

03:28.909 --> 03:29.977
DAVID: They're called express
kidnappings.

03:30.010 --> 03:32.846
I saw a few of them when
I was stationed in Tel Aviv.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.482
People are grabbed
off the street, and held

03:34.515 --> 03:35.949
for a couple of days;
they're forced

03:35.983 --> 03:37.618
to drain their bank account
before they're released.

03:37.651 --> 03:38.719
(phone rings)
Our victims' families

03:38.752 --> 03:39.587
are scared,

03:39.620 --> 03:40.654
but the dollar amounts
are so small,

03:40.688 --> 03:42.423
they pay up, and, uh,
report it after the fact.

03:42.456 --> 03:44.425
It's the fifth
in seven weeks,

03:44.458 --> 03:46.460
and they're all middle income
working women,

03:46.494 --> 03:48.496
raped, assaulted,
and then dumped off.

03:48.529 --> 03:49.963
It's the first time
they've killed.

03:49.997 --> 03:50.898
First time anyone ran.

03:50.931 --> 03:51.899
NIKKI: You run from somebody
with a gun,

03:51.932 --> 03:53.801
maybe you figure
they're going to use it anyway.

03:53.834 --> 03:56.036
New guy,
you're with me.

03:56.069 --> 03:59.973
Why do I have a feeling
that's going to stick?

04:00.007 --> 04:02.810
A male, white,
NFD dumped the truck.

04:02.843 --> 04:05.045
A gray four-door
picked him up and took off.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.514
Where'd they see it from?

04:06.547 --> 04:08.449
Far side of the roof.

04:08.482 --> 04:10.384
Hence the "no
further description."

04:10.418 --> 04:13.020
Firemen found evidence
of a Molotov in the cabin.

04:13.053 --> 04:15.456
Another new guy question.

04:15.489 --> 04:16.657
Yeah.
How bad are the bad guys

04:16.690 --> 04:18.025
that kill their own partner
for screwing up?

04:32.473 --> 04:34.508
NIKKI: Joey Herman-- frequent
flyer

04:34.542 --> 04:36.677
with the California
Department of Corrections.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.912
Discharged from
Chino last May

04:38.946 --> 04:41.749
after a three-year bid for
hitting a jewelry exchange.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.984
Guy's a high-end thief,
but no mastermind.

04:44.017 --> 04:46.320
Might explain the bullet
in the head.

04:46.354 --> 04:48.689
It matches the Suspect Three
description and composite sketch

04:48.722 --> 04:50.023
the other victims gave us.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.291
Only three more to go.

04:51.325 --> 04:53.961
Whoever was on the other side
of the gun knows their business.

04:53.994 --> 04:56.063
Lab says the inside of the van
was washed down

04:56.096 --> 04:57.498
with bleach
before it was torched,

04:57.531 --> 04:58.966
so, whatever
forensic evidence

04:58.999 --> 05:01.068
we do recover
probably won't work for us

05:01.101 --> 05:02.536
until after we catch them.

05:02.570 --> 05:03.537
All right, in
five robberies,

05:03.571 --> 05:05.806
these guys have pulled
down less than 20 grand.

05:05.839 --> 05:08.409
Kidnapping, two homicides--
that's a lot of exposure

05:08.442 --> 05:10.043
for not a lot of money.

05:10.077 --> 05:11.945
In East L.A., people get stabbed
over a six-pack.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.481
COLBY: Yeah, but this isn't East
L.A.,

05:13.514 --> 05:14.915
and these guys aren't meth heads
on a tear.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.083
M.O. says it's a serious crew.

05:16.116 --> 05:18.452
DAVID:
These express kidnappings--

05:18.486 --> 05:19.920
they make sense
south of the border,

05:19.953 --> 05:20.954
or in Third World countries

05:20.988 --> 05:22.723
where a little
bit of money's

05:22.756 --> 05:24.658
gonna take you
far, but, uh,

05:24.692 --> 05:26.093
nobody moves
from six-figure jewelry hits

05:26.126 --> 05:27.928
to low-take thugging
for no reason.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.663
We're missing some pieces.

05:29.697 --> 05:30.798
But a guy like this--

05:30.831 --> 05:32.099
there's always an ex-cellmate

05:32.132 --> 05:33.066
or a known associate

05:33.100 --> 05:34.034
somewhere in the picture.

05:34.067 --> 05:36.136
Yeah-- it sounds like
a lot of grunt work.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.505
Yes, it does.

05:37.538 --> 05:39.006
I wonder
who's gonna get stuck with that.

05:39.039 --> 05:41.008
DAVID:
It'd probably be

05:41.041 --> 05:42.543
a seniority thing, I think.

05:42.576 --> 05:44.044
Hmm.

05:44.077 --> 05:45.913
That's going to get old fast.

05:45.946 --> 05:47.815
Yeah, maybe for you it will.

05:50.083 --> 05:52.420
MAN (on TV):
The facts of the shooting

05:52.453 --> 05:53.521
are still
under investigation

05:53.554 --> 05:54.388
at this point in time,

05:54.422 --> 05:55.155
but it appears
to be connected to...

05:55.188 --> 05:56.223
Hey, hey, I'm glad
you're here.

05:56.256 --> 05:58.025
So, I'm watching the news
here, and I see these...

05:58.058 --> 05:59.393
I mean, is this your case?

05:59.427 --> 06:01.028
DON:
Yeah.

06:01.061 --> 06:03.531
I know you can't
talk about it.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.466
Just what you see there.

06:06.634 --> 06:08.001
It occurred to me--

06:08.035 --> 06:09.837
and-and, you know,
it's just an idle thought--

06:09.870 --> 06:11.004
that a point-by-point

06:11.038 --> 06:11.939
analysis, using the math

06:11.972 --> 06:13.674
that I've already
refined for you guys...

06:13.707 --> 06:15.876
You just plug that data in

06:15.909 --> 06:17.110
and-and run with it.

06:17.144 --> 06:18.812
- Yeah, we're already on that.
- You are?

06:18.846 --> 06:20.448
- Mm-hmm.
- Good.

06:24.918 --> 06:26.887
I mean, they aren't
leaving us much.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.022
We're gonna have to get
them on the street.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.558
Doesn't that mean
that you're waiting

06:30.591 --> 06:32.860
- for another victim?
- Or a decoy.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.128
I mean, we could put ten,
20, 30 women out there.

06:35.162 --> 06:36.564
See if maybe they pick one up.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.131
You know, in marketing,

06:38.165 --> 06:40.434
there's something called
the decoy effect.

06:40.468 --> 06:42.069
It's like when
you went out

06:42.102 --> 06:45.072
to buy that watch
you got on there.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.174
You had a choice between
a more expensive,

06:47.207 --> 06:48.876
higher-end, waterproof,

06:48.909 --> 06:50.878
scratch-resistant watch
with a tachometer,

06:50.911 --> 06:53.747
and a less expensive watch
that does nothing but tell time.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.082
And you made your choice

06:55.115 --> 06:58.051
by how you balance function
and cost.

06:58.085 --> 07:01.555
But let's say, a third watch
is put on the market.

07:01.589 --> 07:03.156
More expensive,
but no tachometer.

07:03.190 --> 07:05.559
Most buyers will gravitate
toward the original,

07:05.593 --> 07:07.227
higher-end product, regardless
of their prior preference.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.530
So, that third watch
is the decoy.

07:09.563 --> 07:10.698
It exists solely

07:10.731 --> 07:13.133
to steer buyers to
the bigger sale.

07:13.166 --> 07:14.234
And that's called asymmetric
dominance.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.302
So, how...?

07:15.335 --> 07:17.037
Well, you can't just put
targets out on the street

07:17.070 --> 07:18.238
that you want
kidnappers to attack.

07:18.271 --> 07:21.141
You can create conditions
that make them more desirable.

07:21.174 --> 07:22.476
A distribution
of police patrols,

07:22.510 --> 07:23.611
inspection points--

07:23.644 --> 07:25.646
I mean, this is stuff you
would normally do anyway,

07:25.679 --> 07:28.181
except funneled through a series
of algorithmic...

07:28.215 --> 07:30.117
You think it's something
Larry or Amita could do?

07:30.150 --> 07:31.218
Well, yeah. No, sure. I...

07:31.251 --> 07:34.054
Sure. Larry and Amita
are very, highly skilled...

07:34.087 --> 07:36.123
I just... I'm just saying
that I could come up

07:36.156 --> 07:37.658
with some very loose expressions

07:37.691 --> 07:42.563
and give them a push
in the right direction.

07:42.596 --> 07:44.565
Hey, so, what do you know

07:44.598 --> 07:46.199
about this FBI
Security Officer,

07:46.233 --> 07:47.100
uh, McGowan?

07:47.134 --> 07:49.136
Carl?

07:49.169 --> 07:50.538
Yeah, Carl McGowan.

07:50.571 --> 07:52.840
He's tough, but-but he's fair.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.241
More tough, more fair?

07:54.274 --> 07:56.176
(sighs)

07:56.209 --> 07:57.711
You know, you'll be fine.

07:57.745 --> 07:59.112
That's not an answer.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.649
(phone ringing)

08:01.682 --> 08:02.916
Yeah.

08:02.950 --> 08:05.052
Eppes.

08:07.621 --> 08:08.856
We put out a five-county alert

08:08.889 --> 08:11.625
for any missing persons reports
that match our victim profile.

08:11.659 --> 08:13.727
I started with today's,
figuring these guys

08:13.761 --> 08:16.530
don't snatch more
than one vic at a time.

08:16.564 --> 08:17.531
(computer chirps)

08:17.565 --> 08:18.699
Popped Janet Gerber,

08:18.732 --> 08:21.101
office manager at an HMO
in Hollywood.

08:21.134 --> 08:23.737
Left her job at 4:30,
reported missing at 8:00.

08:23.771 --> 08:25.172
That's pretty fast.

08:25.205 --> 08:26.173
News has everyone on edge.

08:26.206 --> 08:28.576
She is right in the sweet spot
of our profile.

08:28.609 --> 08:30.744
Female, 25, middle income.

08:30.778 --> 08:32.746
- Still...
- Yeah, I wouldn't have

08:32.780 --> 08:33.814
dragged you back here

08:33.847 --> 08:36.116
in the middle of the night
if there wasn't more.

08:45.993 --> 08:47.060
Oh, damn.

08:47.094 --> 08:48.596
Their M.O. holds up,

08:48.629 --> 08:50.130
they'll dump the van, switch

08:50.163 --> 08:51.231
to a delivery truck again.

08:51.264 --> 08:53.300
Right, sure. Blends in more,
easier to control, or...

08:53.333 --> 08:54.902
I'm thinking,
press conference, right?

08:54.935 --> 08:56.670
Put her face on the news.

08:56.704 --> 08:58.772
Maybe these guys get rattled,
let her go.

08:58.806 --> 08:59.873
Only when things went bad
before,

08:59.907 --> 09:01.008
that's exactly
what they didn't do.

09:07.114 --> 09:09.216
What am I looking for?

09:09.249 --> 09:11.018
Credit card bills,
bank statements--

09:11.051 --> 09:13.721
anything that might
help us track her.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.656
She's never home past 6:00.

09:15.689 --> 09:18.959
But when I called the police,
I was hoping...

09:20.393 --> 09:23.230
Then they told me
they'd kill her if I called you,

09:23.263 --> 09:24.632
but I already had.

09:24.665 --> 09:26.734
They're going to tell you
what helps them,

09:26.767 --> 09:28.769
not what's going to help Janet.

09:28.802 --> 09:30.070
You did the right thing.

09:30.103 --> 09:31.872
(crying):
Janet isn't reckless.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.241
She's careful
about where she goes.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.576
She pays attention
to everything around her.

09:38.746 --> 09:39.880
(sniffles)

09:39.913 --> 09:42.249
If they can just grab you
off the street,

09:42.282 --> 09:44.251
no rhyme or reason...

09:44.284 --> 09:45.986
(sniffles)

09:46.019 --> 09:48.155
...how do you protect yourself
from that?

09:48.188 --> 09:51.191
The woman on the TV--
they killed her.

09:51.224 --> 09:53.193
The ones before--

09:53.226 --> 09:55.729
they beat them,

09:55.763 --> 09:57.765
they raped them.

09:57.798 --> 09:59.900
We're going to do everything
in our power

09:59.933 --> 10:02.169
to bring Janet back here safely.

10:10.678 --> 10:12.746
Hey, guys, thanks
for stepping up here, huh?

10:12.780 --> 10:14.848
Yeah, well, we're still
getting up to speed.

10:14.882 --> 10:17.818
Um, asymmetric dominance
is pretty basic stuff.

10:17.851 --> 10:19.753
Yeah, but Charlie's
applications of it

10:19.787 --> 10:21.288
are anything
but basic.

10:21.321 --> 10:23.757
DON: Well, we're in the middle
of a kidnapping right now,

10:23.791 --> 10:26.026
so it may end up being
for nothing, but thanks.

10:26.059 --> 10:27.695
AMITA: All right. I would remind
you

10:27.728 --> 10:29.797
that the planet known
as rho-1 Cancri e

10:29.830 --> 10:31.832
was discovered
purely by accident,

10:31.865 --> 10:35.803
when scientists were modeling
the motion of its home star.

10:35.836 --> 10:36.804
What?

10:36.837 --> 10:38.972
There is no wasted work.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.240
Right.

10:40.273 --> 10:42.109
Nikki, what do we got?

10:42.142 --> 10:45.846
Uh, the National Bank Network
gave us access to SPIDER--

10:45.879 --> 10:47.848
a tracking program
for ATM usage

10:47.881 --> 10:49.282
that they use to detect fraud.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.819
Almost every ATM in the country
is on the system.

10:51.852 --> 10:54.187
It provides real-time
transactions

10:54.221 --> 10:55.923
at 400,000 cash machines

10:55.956 --> 10:57.991
nationwide--
check this out.

10:58.025 --> 10:59.827
It even shows
how much cash

10:59.860 --> 11:01.328
is available
in any machine

11:01.361 --> 11:03.096
at any one time,
and that's how they know

11:03.130 --> 11:04.197
when they have
to be refilled.

11:04.231 --> 11:05.933
Okay, so...

11:05.966 --> 11:08.769
Every time you use an ATM card,
SPIDER calls the bank

11:08.802 --> 11:10.403
to make sure you have
enough cash available.

11:10.437 --> 11:13.340
We have three hits already
on Janet Gerber's cards.

11:15.776 --> 11:17.210
Here, here, and here.

11:17.244 --> 11:19.079
The last one was two hours ago.

11:19.112 --> 11:20.213
You get units in there?

11:20.247 --> 11:21.381
I notified LAPD.

11:21.414 --> 11:23.050
Colby and David
are cruising the area.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.785
Do we have any shots of her?

11:27.821 --> 11:29.289
We're running
facial recognition

11:29.322 --> 11:30.958
for the other customers.

11:34.027 --> 11:34.928
Oh, what's that?

11:36.429 --> 11:37.765
Right there.

11:37.798 --> 11:39.900
Staying just outside
of camera range.

11:39.933 --> 11:40.934
That's the guy.

11:44.938 --> 11:45.773
We got a hit.

11:45.806 --> 11:47.941
Someone's using
one of her cards at...

11:47.975 --> 11:48.942
COLBY:
It's Fifth and Alameda.

11:51.344 --> 11:52.780
(engine revving,
tires screeching)

11:52.813 --> 11:54.247
COLBY:
In one piece, please.

11:54.281 --> 11:57.217
Hey, you know the rule:
you complain, you drive.

12:01.822 --> 12:03.456
Too late?

12:03.490 --> 12:05.358
Unless that's him.

12:09.997 --> 12:12.800
Doesn't look like any
of these sketches.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.902
Do they ever?

12:18.939 --> 12:20.107
DAVID: That matches the
description

12:20.140 --> 12:21.041
of the kidnapper's van.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.213
(engine roaring,
tires screeching)

12:37.257 --> 12:39.759
(tires screeching)

12:42.362 --> 12:44.764
(tires screeching)

12:51.905 --> 12:53.874
(horn honking,
tires screeching)

12:53.907 --> 12:55.208
Hey, look out!

12:55.242 --> 12:56.309
(tires screeching)

12:57.577 --> 12:58.578
FBI!

12:58.611 --> 12:59.947
Stay in the truck!

12:59.980 --> 13:01.915
Yeah, I didn't see him.

13:01.949 --> 13:04.217
(panting)

13:06.119 --> 13:08.455
He's pretty damned dead.

13:08.488 --> 13:09.456
Van's empty.

13:09.489 --> 13:12.059
That leaves two at large.

13:12.092 --> 13:13.861
And they still
have Janet Gerber.

13:22.936 --> 13:23.904
WOMAN: I've already told you
everything

13:23.937 --> 13:24.938
that I remember.

13:24.972 --> 13:27.040
There have been new
developments, Ms. Mooney.

13:27.074 --> 13:29.242
We've got another victim
out there.

13:29.276 --> 13:32.312
I'm sorry.

13:32.345 --> 13:35.448
I've been trying
to forget what happened.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.425
This one.

13:45.458 --> 13:47.060
He'd get out of the van with me

13:47.094 --> 13:48.428
when they told me
to get money.

13:48.461 --> 13:49.429
He had a gun.

13:49.462 --> 13:50.898
He didn't...

13:50.931 --> 13:53.333
he wasn't a part
of the rest of it.

13:55.202 --> 13:56.403
You recognize anyone else?

13:58.371 --> 13:59.639
No.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.308
You're sure?

14:02.442 --> 14:05.979
I spent 38 hours with those...

14:06.013 --> 14:08.015
Yes, I'm sure.

14:08.048 --> 14:09.416
NIKKI: In the report, you said
there

14:09.449 --> 14:11.484
was a fourth man,
one they met in the parking lot?

14:11.518 --> 14:13.653
He just talked to them
for a few minutes,

14:13.686 --> 14:14.721
and then he left.

14:14.754 --> 14:17.891
They called someone
every few hours after that.

14:17.925 --> 14:18.525
I got the sense
that it was him.

14:18.558 --> 14:19.426
What did they talk about?

14:19.459 --> 14:23.063
Which banks to go to, maybe.

14:23.096 --> 14:25.999
I think... I...
I don't remember.

14:26.033 --> 14:28.135
They had me on the floor
most of the time.

14:31.071 --> 14:34.074
This woman,
the one that they have now...

14:34.107 --> 14:36.143
We're gonna do everything
we can to get her back safe.

14:38.946 --> 14:40.180
NIKKI:
Zack Talling.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.015
He was in County
on a drug charge,

14:42.049 --> 14:43.450
during three
of the five kidnappings.

14:43.483 --> 14:45.352
DON: Okay, so they do Herman for
screwing up,

14:45.385 --> 14:47.120
and then they bring in Talling.

14:47.154 --> 14:48.355
NIKKI: The minivan was scrubbed
clean,

14:48.388 --> 14:50.223
and we figure Talling
was supposed to dump it.

14:50.257 --> 14:52.559
He decided to stop
and buy a case instead.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.962
He pockets one
of Janet Gerber's ATM cards,

14:54.995 --> 14:56.429
decides to skim
a little cash for himself.

14:56.463 --> 14:58.932
Definitely hit the
discount rack with Talling.

14:58.966 --> 15:00.500
Liquor stores, carjackings...

15:00.533 --> 15:02.069
There's no
more activity

15:02.102 --> 15:04.304
- on her other cards?
- No, they've gone cold.

15:04.337 --> 15:08.075
When Talling doesn't come back,
they gotta be nervous.

15:08.108 --> 15:10.477
They should have closed up shop
when they lost Herman.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.512
Herman didn't participate
in the rapes.

15:12.545 --> 15:16.083
Maybe he was the alpha dog,
then they turned on him.

15:23.356 --> 15:24.992
That's the alpha.

15:25.025 --> 15:26.493
He doesn't ride with them,

15:26.526 --> 15:28.996
he tells them where to go,
he tells them what ATMs to hit.

15:29.029 --> 15:30.597
And he doesn't care
what his guys do

15:30.630 --> 15:32.165
to the women,
but he's meticulous enough

15:32.199 --> 15:33.366
to scrub down
the evidence.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.701
He makes
their ransom calls

15:34.734 --> 15:36.369
from burner phones,
kills off his weak link.

15:36.403 --> 15:38.038
So why is this
professional

15:38.071 --> 15:40.007
pulling high exposure
for pocket change?

15:40.040 --> 15:42.009
They don't even max out
the withdrawals.

15:42.042 --> 15:43.510
It's all these
weird amounts--

15:43.543 --> 15:45.578
$420, $340.

15:47.114 --> 15:49.716
Best guy to answer
a strange digit question...

15:49.749 --> 15:50.717
Can't do that.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.952
Okay.

15:57.524 --> 16:00.360
(knocking on door)

16:00.393 --> 16:02.462
Agent McGowan?

16:02.495 --> 16:04.064
Have a seat, Professor.

16:19.112 --> 16:20.413
So, um...

16:20.447 --> 16:22.149
Just a second.

16:29.256 --> 16:30.590
You didn't bring
an attorney with you?

16:30.623 --> 16:33.226
I didn't realize I needed one.

16:33.260 --> 16:35.028
All the charges were dropped.

16:35.062 --> 16:38.065
To avoid a black eye, I know.

16:38.098 --> 16:40.033
Black eye?

16:40.067 --> 16:43.136
An FBI consultant
sends classified

16:43.170 --> 16:45.105
and potentially
dangerous information

16:45.138 --> 16:46.639
to an unauthorized
foreign group.

16:46.673 --> 16:50.043
I assume that a multiple Ph.D.

16:50.077 --> 16:52.245
can infer the potential
for embarrassment.

16:52.279 --> 16:54.547
That information
was for growing crops.

16:54.581 --> 16:56.083
An embarrassment
to the Bureau,

16:56.116 --> 16:57.450
the United States
Government,

16:57.484 --> 16:59.352
and to your brother.

16:59.386 --> 17:01.221
- My brother...
- He probably committed

17:01.254 --> 17:02.622
a slow-acting career suicide

17:02.655 --> 17:05.158
the day he brought you in
to work on that first case.

17:05.192 --> 17:07.560
But that's on him.

17:07.594 --> 17:09.096
You know, I get the impression

17:09.129 --> 17:12.132
that your mind
is already made up.

17:12.165 --> 17:14.834
The FBI's guidelines
very specifically prohibit me

17:14.867 --> 17:17.304
from applying my personal
opinion to the review

17:17.337 --> 17:19.706
of a suspended
security clearance.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.474
And I wouldn't
be so unprofessional

17:21.508 --> 17:23.643
as to ignore agency guidelines.

17:27.114 --> 17:30.683
You know, I've given
a lot of my time

17:30.717 --> 17:33.220
and work to the FBI.

17:33.253 --> 17:35.222
But that isn't
why you're here, is it?

17:35.255 --> 17:37.224
You're here because a loss
of clearance

17:37.257 --> 17:38.425
keeps you from making money

17:38.458 --> 17:40.193
off some big government
research projects.

17:40.227 --> 17:43.130
Just saying that betrays
how little you know about me.

17:43.163 --> 17:46.166
Maybe not yet,
but I'm going to.

17:46.199 --> 17:48.601
Your life's going
to become transparent to me.

17:48.635 --> 17:50.537
I'm going to ask you
about things you're going

17:50.570 --> 17:52.505
to think I have no
business asking you about.

17:52.539 --> 17:54.841
And given the slenderness
of the thread

17:54.874 --> 17:57.144
on which your professional
future hangs,

17:57.177 --> 17:59.679
it will behoove you
to answer every one of them

17:59.712 --> 18:02.349
completely and honestly.

18:06.153 --> 18:07.587
Then I will talk to my lawyer.

18:13.226 --> 18:16.229
(indistinct radio communication)

18:20.733 --> 18:22.635
Hey.

18:22.669 --> 18:24.171
Couple of homeless guys

18:24.204 --> 18:25.805
were doing
their weekly scrounge.

18:28.175 --> 18:30.109
We didn't get her home.

18:31.211 --> 18:33.146
One bullet
to the back of the head.

18:33.180 --> 18:34.681
No signs of assault,
no indications of rape.

18:34.714 --> 18:37.150
They were trying to get
rid of her in a hurry.

18:37.184 --> 18:38.385
They're getting sloppier.

18:38.418 --> 18:39.619
And more violent.

18:39.652 --> 18:41.188
Check this out.

18:41.221 --> 18:45.758
Techs say these and these
are fresh.

18:45.792 --> 18:46.693
Two sets.

18:46.726 --> 18:49.662
They dump one truck,
have a backup ready.

18:51.398 --> 18:53.300
They're not done.

18:58.671 --> 19:00.407
Using asymmetric dominance,

19:00.440 --> 19:02.309
we built a consideration set
on the framework

19:02.342 --> 19:03.876
of the prior abductions,

19:03.910 --> 19:05.578
and then we filtered
all of that

19:05.612 --> 19:07.614
through a very powerful
regression analysis.

19:07.647 --> 19:08.915
What?

19:08.948 --> 19:10.617
You'll say that
for about three or four months,

19:10.650 --> 19:11.751
then learn
to go along with it.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.653
AMITA:
Let's call it decoy math.

19:13.686 --> 19:15.788
It's a way of building
optimal conditions

19:15.822 --> 19:16.856
for an off-the-street
kidnapping

19:16.889 --> 19:19.792
by the strategic placement
of not only the decoy,

19:19.826 --> 19:21.694
but of additional
police patrols and checkpoints.

19:21.728 --> 19:24.231
We begin with
the police patrols

19:24.264 --> 19:25.898
and the presumed boundaries

19:25.932 --> 19:27.634
created
by those patrols,

19:27.667 --> 19:29.436
and then we factor in
all of this publicity

19:29.469 --> 19:30.637
surrounding
the kidnappings,

19:30.670 --> 19:32.805
and then we can factor
all of that

19:32.839 --> 19:34.574
onto the target pool.

19:38.311 --> 19:41.748
Most women
are being more careful now.

19:41.781 --> 19:43.316
So, the red zones
are optimal,

19:43.350 --> 19:45.752
with the orange zones
as secondary targets.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.754
And all of this presupposes
that you will be following

19:47.787 --> 19:49.722
our methods of shaping
these target zones:

19:49.756 --> 19:52.692
disabling street lights
to create darkened conditions

19:52.725 --> 19:53.660
and diverting traffic

19:53.693 --> 19:55.562
to isolate
certain streets...

19:55.595 --> 19:57.797
Yeah, but you got
like 50 places there.

19:57.830 --> 19:59.732
Uh, no, we... actually 43.

19:59.766 --> 20:01.368
You got a favorite?

20:01.401 --> 20:02.369
A favorite?

20:02.402 --> 20:04.504
No, but I tell you what.

20:04.537 --> 20:07.607
I would incorporate,
in any distribution,

20:07.640 --> 20:10.543
the corner
of Wilshire and Grand.

20:10.577 --> 20:11.678
That's based on...?

20:12.812 --> 20:14.681
A hunch, I guess.

20:14.714 --> 20:17.850
Guess I'm on the corner
of Wilshire and Grand.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.619
Whoa, whoa, whoa, who
said you're anywhere?

20:19.652 --> 20:21.621
You need 43 decoys.

20:21.654 --> 20:24.491
There more than 42
other female 20s agents

20:24.524 --> 20:25.592
hanging around the office?

20:28.428 --> 20:30.297
(sighs)

20:30.330 --> 20:32.031
CHARLIE: You see it in academia
all the time.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.366
A petty bureaucrat mired

20:33.400 --> 20:35.402
in 20 or 30 years
of mindless habit,

20:35.435 --> 20:36.469
an axe to grind.

20:36.503 --> 20:37.704
And that axe is what, exactly?

20:37.737 --> 20:40.540
Any non-traditional
investigative technique

20:40.573 --> 20:42.375
or any alternative
point of view.

20:42.409 --> 20:43.876
Who the hell knows?
Who the hell cares?

20:43.910 --> 20:45.745
Well, you should,
you should care.

20:45.778 --> 20:47.714
What did your lawyer
have to say?

20:47.747 --> 20:48.781
Same thing as McGowan,

20:48.815 --> 20:50.683
in that I have no real option
but to cooperate.

20:50.717 --> 20:51.884
He's gonna go
through the motions,

20:51.918 --> 20:53.486
but he's already
closed the book on me.

20:53.520 --> 20:54.554
Well, even if
that's true,

20:54.587 --> 20:56.523
you have to fight it
as if it isn't.

20:56.556 --> 20:57.757
Yeah, you know what he said?

20:57.790 --> 20:58.625
You know what he said?

20:58.658 --> 21:00.393
Actually,
he pretty clearly implied

21:00.427 --> 21:01.661
that I'd ruined Don's career.

21:01.694 --> 21:03.830
What does Don have to say
about that?

21:03.863 --> 21:05.932
I don't know, I haven't talked
to him about it yet.

21:05.965 --> 21:08.368
Besides, you know, he'll just
grunt and change the subject.

21:11.671 --> 21:13.706
When I sent that research
to Pakistan,

21:13.740 --> 21:16.509
I was well aware of what it
might do to my future.

21:16.543 --> 21:18.711
I didn't stop to think
of what it would do to Don's.

21:20.347 --> 21:21.448
Not really.

21:23.750 --> 21:24.917
Hey.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.619
You got to love
that federal budget.

21:26.653 --> 21:28.921
LAPD Comtecs are the size
of a small brick.

21:28.955 --> 21:30.590
That's right,
you're in the majors now.

21:30.623 --> 21:31.524
(chuckling)

21:31.558 --> 21:33.360
Look, you know
all that "new guy" stuff's

21:33.393 --> 21:34.794
- just part of...
- Being the new guy?

21:34.827 --> 21:35.695
Yeah.

21:35.728 --> 21:37.664
It's when they stop
busting your ass,

21:37.697 --> 21:38.965
that's when you really
better start worrying.

21:38.998 --> 21:40.800
Nah, I'm not sweating it.

21:40.833 --> 21:42.802
I... I was just out
of Quantico,

21:42.835 --> 21:45.071
and they sent me
to Detroit.

21:45.104 --> 21:47.707
Right? So I gotta answer
phones for three weeks,

21:47.740 --> 21:49.842
which felt
like three months.

21:49.876 --> 21:51.511
One day, they...

21:51.544 --> 21:53.646
they're shorthanded,
so they sent me out

21:53.680 --> 21:57.850
on this no-knock warrant
to these biker outlaws, right?

21:57.884 --> 21:59.919
The Ugly Bastards.

21:59.952 --> 22:02.054
I, uh, volunteered
to take point.

22:02.088 --> 22:04.457
Yeah? So how'd that
work out for you?

22:04.491 --> 22:06.359
I got my ass handed
to me pretty damn good.

22:06.393 --> 22:07.760
I was right back on the phones.

22:09.161 --> 22:10.997
Wild guess-- there's a point
in there somewhere?

22:11.030 --> 22:13.766
You got a long career here
hopefully, so, you know,

22:13.800 --> 22:15.668
you don't have to prove
everything in the first month.

22:17.804 --> 22:20.072
My straight out of the Academy?

22:20.106 --> 22:22.875
Some Parker Center genius

22:22.909 --> 22:24.911
decides to dump me
in Knickerson Gardens,

22:24.944 --> 22:25.912
doing buy and busts.

22:25.945 --> 22:28.781
You know, he figured fresh face,
no cop habits--

22:28.815 --> 22:29.916
I'd be the perfect undercover.

22:29.949 --> 22:31.551
Never mind that
I hadn't learned

22:31.584 --> 22:34.621
to find my ass
with both hands yet, you know.

22:34.654 --> 22:37.757
Day five, citizen named
Latwan Rivers

22:37.790 --> 22:39.058
sticks a .22 in my face.

22:39.091 --> 22:41.794
Tries to stick
something else somewhere else.

22:41.828 --> 22:43.963
After medical leave,
psych evaluation,

22:43.996 --> 22:46.866
and a piece of paper that has me
promising not to sue the city

22:46.899 --> 22:48.067
- for stupidity.
- Ah.

22:48.100 --> 22:51.103
they offer me
any assignment I want.

22:51.137 --> 22:53.973
Next day, I'm back
in Knickerson Gardens

22:54.006 --> 22:55.808
doing buy and busts.

22:55.842 --> 22:58.411
This is a wild guess-- is there
some point there somewhere?

22:58.445 --> 23:00.547
Yeah, I know there're a lot
of answering phones

23:00.580 --> 23:02.982
and DMV checks
in my immediate future.

23:03.015 --> 23:05.918
You give me a chance
to get dirty, I'm there.

23:07.053 --> 23:08.855
All right, noted.

23:14.060 --> 23:15.828
MAN (over radio):
Decoy Nine, we're turning

23:15.862 --> 23:16.629
the starting point.

23:16.663 --> 23:18.831
Decoy 18 heading north
on Euclid.

23:18.865 --> 23:20.433
DAVID (over radio):
Decoy Five taking another pass.

23:21.968 --> 23:23.936
(softly):
And around the block again.

23:27.173 --> 23:29.175
You can back off
a little, guys.

23:29.208 --> 23:30.910
You're ghosting me
a little tight.

23:30.943 --> 23:32.979
All right, thanks
for that, new guy.

23:33.012 --> 23:35.948
- Aw, you know how it is.
- Yeah.

23:35.982 --> 23:38.585
I know Betancourt can notch it
back a little bit.

23:38.618 --> 23:39.986
Right, 'cause it was

23:40.019 --> 23:42.088
somebody else who nearly
got me shot his second week

23:42.121 --> 23:44.791
showing tough
to a Vietnamese biker gang?

23:50.863 --> 23:53.766
Decoy Five is moving south

23:53.800 --> 23:55.167
- on Grand.
- DON: Hey, Billy,

23:55.201 --> 23:56.035
you better
tell Hollywood patrol

23:56.068 --> 23:57.069
to back off another block,
all right?

23:57.103 --> 24:00.072
And Joan, have 14 slow down
on the next pass.

24:00.106 --> 24:01.974
- Okay. Hey, 14?
- Copy that.

24:13.085 --> 24:15.955
Guys, I think we got a bite.

24:15.988 --> 24:17.123
(typing rapidly)

24:17.156 --> 24:18.991
(beeping)
Plates come back

24:19.025 --> 24:20.527
to a Volkswagen Beetle.

24:20.560 --> 24:21.794
COLBY:
So what do you think?

24:21.828 --> 24:23.563
I say we take that right.

24:47.954 --> 24:48.855
Not a sound.
(grunts)

24:48.888 --> 24:51.023
Get into the van,
you might get out again.

24:52.759 --> 24:53.926
We have a hit; we're on.

25:10.042 --> 25:12.011
Five is active.
I repeat, Five is active.

25:12.044 --> 25:15.582
I want units rolling to Broadway
and Ninth, await further.

25:15.615 --> 25:17.784
Get me eyes and ears.

25:17.817 --> 25:20.252
MAN: Down on the floor!
You do not look up!

25:20.286 --> 25:21.921
NIKKI:
I'm not going to fight.

25:21.954 --> 25:22.622
Keep your mouth shut!

25:22.655 --> 25:23.623
Take whatever you want (grunts).

25:26.125 --> 25:28.761
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm scared!

25:28.795 --> 25:30.797
There're two of you. You have a
gun.

25:30.830 --> 25:31.698
You deaf, bitch?

25:31.731 --> 25:32.699
Hear that, everyone?
Two in the truck.

25:32.732 --> 25:33.900
Surveillance Five,
what's her distress word?

25:33.933 --> 25:35.267
Mexico.

25:35.301 --> 25:37.303
You gave her our
distress word?

25:39.639 --> 25:40.973
DAVID:
Truck's pulling over.

25:45.377 --> 25:47.580
(door opens and closes)

25:53.820 --> 25:55.988
- One and Two.
- We have visual

25:56.022 --> 25:57.724
confirmation
on Suspects One and Two.

25:57.757 --> 26:00.359
AGENT:
S.O.G. Eight is two blocks away.

26:00.392 --> 26:01.928
S.O.G. 22 is four.

26:01.961 --> 26:02.795
All right, everyone stand by.

26:05.632 --> 26:09.936
MAN 2: Lisa Hillman,
2527 Tujunga Ave--

26:09.969 --> 26:14.874
818-555-0189.

26:14.907 --> 26:17.009
(over radio):
460,

26:17.043 --> 26:19.245
340, 280,

26:19.278 --> 26:21.681
480, 120.

26:28.655 --> 26:29.956
(truck engine starts)

26:33.159 --> 26:34.661
DAVID (over radio):
We're moving.

26:34.694 --> 26:36.295
All right, you better break off
and run parallel.

26:36.328 --> 26:37.764
Got it.

26:37.797 --> 26:41.133
And Eight,
pick it up at Grand.

26:41.167 --> 26:43.636
AGENT (over radio):
S.O.G. Eight, we've picked up

26:43.670 --> 26:44.070
the subject.

26:44.103 --> 26:45.237
(phone ringing)

26:47.339 --> 26:48.908
Quiet, everyone.

26:51.678 --> 26:53.112
Hello?

26:53.145 --> 26:54.681
MAN (distorted):
We have your wife.

26:54.714 --> 26:59.318
Lisa Hillman, driver's license
V72533849.

26:59.351 --> 27:01.721
(normal voice):
Don't do anything stupid,

27:01.754 --> 27:04.190
we drop her off
in 12 to 15 hours.

27:04.223 --> 27:06.025
Can I...
let me talk to her.

27:06.058 --> 27:08.027
(distorted): Being stupid would
be calling the police,

27:08.060 --> 27:10.329
(normal):
canceling all her credit cards.

27:10.362 --> 27:12.364
Just make sure there's $5,000

27:12.398 --> 27:14.333
(distorted): in all three of
your bank accounts.

27:14.366 --> 27:15.868
$5,000? I don't have that

27:15.902 --> 27:17.770
kind of money.
Please let me talk to her.

27:20.306 --> 27:21.407
(beeping)

27:21.440 --> 27:23.876
Disposable phone, calling
from a two-mile tower zone

27:23.910 --> 27:25.077
in West Los Angeles.

27:25.111 --> 27:27.413
All right, push the three
nearest units in that direction.

27:27.446 --> 27:28.848
And Five, you copy that?

27:28.881 --> 27:30.883
Affirmative.
You're hoping they lead us

27:30.917 --> 27:32.018
to the alpha.

27:32.051 --> 27:33.419
Right, unless Nikki
calls it off.

27:35.421 --> 27:36.956
(engine roaring)

27:40.159 --> 27:42.228
(brakes squeaking)

27:42.261 --> 27:46.032
MAN: You are going to go take
out $460.

27:46.065 --> 27:48.234
You are going to walk back
to this truck.

27:48.267 --> 27:50.236
You are not
going to talk to anyone.

27:50.269 --> 27:51.871
- $460...
- You are not going to make

27:51.904 --> 27:53.239
eye contact with anyone.

27:53.272 --> 27:55.174
Nod yes.

27:56.308 --> 27:58.911
Get up. Get up!

28:20.132 --> 28:22.168
Have you tried revisiting
the Yukawa potential?

28:22.201 --> 28:25.938
The exponential gives the
interaction finite range.

28:25.972 --> 28:27.840
Oh, and then you're back
where you started.

28:27.874 --> 28:30.042
Charles, as much
as we appreciate your help...

28:30.076 --> 28:32.478
Oh, please, non-collider related
Higgs-Boson physics,

28:32.511 --> 28:35.447
one of my few pleasures
these days.

28:35.481 --> 28:37.116
(whiny):
I'm just so tired.

28:37.149 --> 28:38.184
I want to go home.

28:38.217 --> 28:39.886
(lilting flute ringtone
playing)

28:39.919 --> 28:40.987
Okay, that's me.

28:41.020 --> 28:42.855
I thought you got rid
of your cell.

28:42.889 --> 28:44.190
Yeah, I did.

28:44.223 --> 28:46.893
But your brother
shoved another one at me.

28:46.926 --> 28:49.228
(ringtone continues)

28:51.397 --> 28:52.799
Yes, Don?

28:54.333 --> 28:56.335
I am on my way.

28:56.368 --> 28:58.237
(phone beeps off)

28:58.270 --> 29:00.139
What is that,
the ATM kidnapping case?

29:00.172 --> 29:02.308
Uh...

29:02.341 --> 29:03.943
(sighs)

29:03.976 --> 29:05.344
You know,
I suspect we're looking

29:05.377 --> 29:07.113
at a combinatorics problem--
would you mind?

29:07.146 --> 29:09.949
Sure. Uh, do you...?

29:09.982 --> 29:11.450
No. Of course.

29:12.584 --> 29:14.253
Don't wait up.

29:15.421 --> 29:17.323
(door opens and closes)

29:31.337 --> 29:32.538
Third bank,

29:32.571 --> 29:34.506
still no sign
of our alpha.

29:34.540 --> 29:36.108
DON (over radio):
All right, keep it tight.

29:43.315 --> 29:45.251
(Nikki gasping)

29:52.091 --> 29:53.592
If you have,

29:53.625 --> 29:55.527
have the Internet, I can just
transfer you the money.

29:55.561 --> 29:56.528
MAN 1:
Get back down!

29:56.562 --> 29:57.529
NIKKI:
You have a laptop.

29:57.563 --> 29:59.231
(gasping)

30:01.367 --> 30:02.835
Spider something...

30:02.869 --> 30:05.037
(grunt, clattering)

30:06.538 --> 30:09.375
Can we just do this one
and get another?!

30:09.408 --> 30:11.210
- Don, we've got to go.
- On my signal! On my signal!

30:11.243 --> 30:12.278
Sorry, really.

30:12.311 --> 30:15.281
Sorry. I got $15,000.

30:15.314 --> 30:16.315
What?!

30:16.348 --> 30:18.050
$15,000

30:18.084 --> 30:19.318
that my husband
doesn't know about.

30:19.351 --> 30:20.252
It's in a safe deposit box.

30:20.286 --> 30:21.988
I can get it for you
when the bank opens.

30:22.021 --> 30:22.955
You wouldn't lie to me

30:22.989 --> 30:24.390
just to keep yourself alive,
would you, babe?

30:24.423 --> 30:26.358
I would.

30:26.392 --> 30:27.860
But I swear I'm not.

30:27.894 --> 30:29.261
(laughs)

30:31.630 --> 30:34.066
All right.

30:34.100 --> 30:35.968
Buckle up.

30:36.002 --> 30:37.136
DON:
All right, stand down.

30:37.169 --> 30:38.637
Everyone just stand down,
but stay tight.

30:38.670 --> 30:40.472
Mirror everything
into the Tech Room for me.

30:40.506 --> 30:41.540
AGENT:
Yes, sir.

30:49.581 --> 30:51.517
SPIDER...

30:51.550 --> 30:53.019
Is a real-time ATM tracking
program. Yeah.

30:53.052 --> 30:54.153
Yeah, Charlie
and I did work

30:54.186 --> 30:55.387
on its Distributed
Neural Network

30:55.421 --> 30:57.957
along with half the Cal Sci
Math and Computer Department.

30:57.990 --> 31:00.359
And Nikki tells me they can run
the thing on a laptop.

31:00.392 --> 31:02.228
Yeah. And they're taking odd
amounts.

31:02.261 --> 31:04.030
Instead of like
a hundred or $200,

31:04.063 --> 31:06.265
it's like $460 or $340.

31:06.298 --> 31:07.599
That's right,
atypical amounts,

31:07.633 --> 31:09.368
but combined
with specific knowledge

31:09.401 --> 31:12.071
of both nodes
of the transaction.

31:15.474 --> 31:16.909
The Hall effect.

31:16.943 --> 31:18.644
He's tapping off

31:18.677 --> 31:21.513
a gold leaf, he's applying
a magnetic field

31:21.547 --> 31:23.349
perpendicular
to the electrical current

31:23.382 --> 31:25.451
in order to uncover
the potential difference

31:25.484 --> 31:26.618
on opposite sides
of the conductor.

31:26.652 --> 31:28.454
Hold on, I don't have a clue
what you're talking about.

31:28.487 --> 31:30.156
Okay, I have lost you.
Help me out here.

31:30.189 --> 31:32.491
Okay, by knowing the amount,
the card, the ATM, the bank--

31:32.524 --> 31:34.493
he's able to watch the way
money flows through SPIDER.

31:34.526 --> 31:36.528
- Okay.
- He's trying to find a way

31:36.562 --> 31:39.465
- deeper inside the program.
- To divert the flow, I suspect.

31:39.498 --> 31:41.600
- And also, it does refills.
- Yeah, sure.

31:41.633 --> 31:44.436
Every four or five days,
when the ATM gets low,

31:44.470 --> 31:46.973
SPIDER sends a message to the
armored car servicing it,

31:47.006 --> 31:48.374
telling it
to deliver a refill.

31:48.407 --> 31:49.976
Okay, so if he can

31:50.009 --> 31:51.543
jack his way
into the program...

31:51.577 --> 31:53.445
He could schedule
the delivery of large sums

31:53.479 --> 31:55.714
of money to the most
vulnerable of locations,

31:55.747 --> 31:57.616
and at a time
of his choosing.

31:57.649 --> 31:58.317
Then what's the possibility

31:58.350 --> 31:59.451
of us hacking our way to him?

31:59.485 --> 32:01.453
It's not easy.

32:01.487 --> 32:02.488
All right, well, then...
get working on it, okay?

32:10.762 --> 32:12.464
DAVID:
Fifth and last one, Don.

32:12.498 --> 32:15.667
They've maxed out her cards.

32:36.122 --> 32:38.357
MAN 1:
What time you got?

32:38.390 --> 32:40.459
MAN 2:
Almost 4:00.

32:40.492 --> 32:42.328
We're supposed
to dump her before dawn.

32:42.361 --> 32:44.363
Doesn't give us
much time, does it?

32:52.771 --> 32:54.740
COLBY:
This is going bad.

32:54.773 --> 32:56.342
Don.

32:58.144 --> 33:00.012
NIKKI:
Bank opens in four hours.

33:00.046 --> 33:01.547
$15,000.

33:01.580 --> 33:03.015
I swear to God.

33:04.150 --> 33:06.718
You're right about that.

33:08.820 --> 33:11.723
You will swear to God.

33:25.771 --> 33:27.339
(grunts)

33:27.373 --> 33:28.440
(gunshots)

33:28.474 --> 33:29.775
Go, go, go,
everybody get in there!

33:29.808 --> 33:31.610
Let's go, move!
(tires screeching)

33:36.748 --> 33:39.685
FBI!
Give me a damn reason.

33:39.718 --> 33:41.720
- FBI! Don't move!
- Show us your hands.

33:41.753 --> 33:43.789
MALE AGENT:
Get 'em in the air!

33:43.822 --> 33:45.057
Got one on the
right side!

33:47.726 --> 33:49.761
AGENT:
Turn around.

33:51.197 --> 33:52.631
AGENT 2:
We got both!

33:56.102 --> 33:57.536
She okay?

33:57.569 --> 33:59.171
Yeah, she's okay.

33:59.205 --> 34:01.073
AGENT (on radio):
Two suspects under control...

34:01.107 --> 34:02.274
(elevator bell dings)

34:08.480 --> 34:10.649
DON:
What's the distress word?

34:10.682 --> 34:14.186
- Mexico.
- Why didn't I hear it?

34:14.220 --> 34:15.821
We didn't have the alpha,
and I had everything under...

34:15.854 --> 34:17.789
Took me five seconds
to send them in,

34:17.823 --> 34:18.590
just enough time for you

34:18.624 --> 34:19.791
to get your very
undisciplined head

34:19.825 --> 34:22.228
shot off at least
five times!

34:22.261 --> 34:24.363
- Boss, I was...
- Get changed and start writing!

34:24.396 --> 34:25.597
And when you're done writing,
you can start

34:25.631 --> 34:26.598
getting to know the P904!

34:26.632 --> 34:28.434
That's the telephone.

34:28.467 --> 34:29.668
That's the only
piece of equipment

34:29.701 --> 34:31.603
you're going to be
using for a long time!

34:45.751 --> 34:47.553
Morning.

34:47.586 --> 34:48.887
It's too late for
breakfast, but...

34:48.920 --> 34:50.789
- there's still some coffee.
- No, thanks.

34:50.822 --> 34:55.827
I owe Amita these lesson plans
for our CBME seminar.

34:55.861 --> 34:57.763
She's probably already waiting
for me at Cal Sci.

34:57.796 --> 34:58.897
Actually, when
I left her

34:58.930 --> 35:02.468
at 4:00 a.m. this morning,
she was still at the FBI.

35:02.501 --> 35:03.702
Yeah?

35:03.735 --> 35:05.504
Was there a break on that case?

35:05.537 --> 35:09.441
A break, yes.
A conclusion, no.

35:09.475 --> 35:10.909
Okay, well, then I'll probably
drop these off

35:10.942 --> 35:13.545
on the way to campus.

35:14.646 --> 35:15.614
(door closes)

35:15.647 --> 35:18.584
Now, he sure seems
to have lost a step or two

35:18.617 --> 35:19.685
off his stride.

35:19.718 --> 35:22.454
Yeah, it's this
NSA clearance thing.

35:22.488 --> 35:24.790
I guess there were more eggs
in that basket than he realized.

35:24.823 --> 35:26.692
Well, than any
of us realized.

35:26.725 --> 35:29.161
You know, as scientists,
we tend to take our relationship

35:29.195 --> 35:31.830
with the government
pretty much for granted...

35:31.863 --> 35:35.801
tend to forget just how much our
work depends on their wallet.

35:35.834 --> 35:38.704
Charlie's struggle

35:38.737 --> 35:41.773
is nothing short
of existential.

35:41.807 --> 35:43.842
Well, I guess we have
nothing to worry about, then.

35:43.875 --> 35:45.444
Charlie's always at his best

35:45.477 --> 35:47.279
when his back's
against the wall.

35:47.313 --> 35:48.547
So two more
off the low end.

35:48.580 --> 35:49.681
Gang affiliations,
petty crime jackets.

35:49.715 --> 35:52.951
Chaney, the one in the middle,
did time with Talling.

35:52.984 --> 35:53.952
These guys were prepped.

35:53.985 --> 35:54.953
They both lawyered up as soon

35:54.986 --> 35:55.787
as we got bracelets
on 'em.

35:55.821 --> 35:57.789
Yeah, we got
a death penalty here.

35:57.823 --> 35:59.825
You tell Robin we want
to cut a deal to get the alpha.

35:59.858 --> 36:01.727
COLBY: It's in the works; it's
just going to take some time.

36:01.760 --> 36:04.563
DAVID: Rape, kidnappings, now
two murders.

36:04.596 --> 36:07.266
This guy has got to be rolling
up his operations by now.

36:07.299 --> 36:09.601
Or skipping ahead.

36:09.635 --> 36:10.636
So Joey Herman
screws up.

36:10.669 --> 36:11.737
He kills him,
replaces him.

36:11.770 --> 36:13.939
Zack Talling goes
down, he powers

36:13.972 --> 36:15.874
through the two guys
he's got left.

36:15.907 --> 36:18.244
Changes up his M.O.,
ramps up the timetable,

36:18.277 --> 36:19.678
only makes contact by phone.

36:19.711 --> 36:21.713
I mean, he's smart, but
I don't see him going this far

36:21.747 --> 36:23.915
and not getting paid.

36:23.949 --> 36:25.884
AMITA: There's no indication of
intrusion into the system.

36:25.917 --> 36:27.953
SPIDER's administrators
have changed the pass codes,

36:27.986 --> 36:28.787
locked up the back doors.

36:28.820 --> 36:30.256
It could take him days,
weeks even,

36:30.289 --> 36:31.257
to find a new way in.

36:31.290 --> 36:32.791
But he could still be watching?

36:32.824 --> 36:33.859
Passively? Sure.

36:33.892 --> 36:36.562
So Alpha Dog sees
every ATM reorder in the city.

36:36.595 --> 36:38.364
AMITA:
In the country.

36:38.397 --> 36:39.431
It's a real-time
shopping list

36:39.465 --> 36:40.799
for armored car robberies.

36:40.832 --> 36:42.601
Hey, wha-what...? Look, I got
the visitor's badge.

36:42.634 --> 36:43.835
Jimmy walked me over.

36:43.869 --> 36:44.836
These are for you.

36:44.870 --> 36:46.305
How's it going, guys?

36:46.338 --> 36:47.439
- Thanks.
- And SPIDER is an independently

36:47.473 --> 36:49.808
owned and operated program,

36:49.841 --> 36:50.776
so there's
no clearance issue there.

36:50.809 --> 36:51.943
At a glance,
I can tell you

36:51.977 --> 36:53.712
that the ATM
kidnappings are a way

36:53.745 --> 36:55.314
to map into the
program by locating

36:55.347 --> 36:56.948
known transactions--
a back door, by the way,

36:56.982 --> 36:59.017
we mentioned to the
programmers two years ago...

36:59.050 --> 37:00.852
Charlie, stop.
Come on, you can't.

37:00.886 --> 37:02.288
Y-You can't do this.

37:02.321 --> 37:03.522
No, I can help,
all right?

37:03.555 --> 37:07.726
And McGowan-- McGowan can go
to hell if he doesn't get that.

37:07.759 --> 37:09.528
Look, you don't understand
the politics here.

37:09.561 --> 37:10.262
I'm beginning to.

37:10.296 --> 37:11.096
You have a guy
who's kidnapped

37:11.129 --> 37:12.631
and murdered
and facilitated rape.

37:12.664 --> 37:14.266
He's smart,
he's going to do it again.

37:14.300 --> 37:15.767
If it were you,
would you let the rules

37:15.801 --> 37:17.436
get in the way
of stopping him?

37:18.570 --> 37:21.340
(chuckles)

37:21.373 --> 37:22.408
Let's do this.

37:22.441 --> 37:23.642
All right,
he's gonna move fast.

37:23.675 --> 37:25.511
He's gonna hit once
in the next day or two.

37:25.544 --> 37:26.912
That is if he can put together
another crew that fast.

37:26.945 --> 37:27.846
Yeah, but maybe
he already has one.

37:27.879 --> 37:29.881
I mean, Herman was
the only high-end guy.

37:29.915 --> 37:31.917
DAVID: Maybe that's why he
brought in Talling.

37:31.950 --> 37:33.084
I mean,
after losing Joey Herman,

37:33.118 --> 37:35.587
he wasn't willing to risk
any more of his real talent.

37:35.621 --> 37:36.488
But why
risk Herman

37:36.522 --> 37:38.390
on the kidnapping
in the first place?

37:38.424 --> 37:39.891
CHARLIE: He's probably running
his own version

37:39.925 --> 37:42.060
- of a scheduling algorithm.
- Yeah, computers use them

37:42.093 --> 37:44.363
to weigh the duration or
difficulty of certain tasks

37:44.396 --> 37:45.931
against the system's resources

37:45.964 --> 37:47.399
and then allocate them
accordingly.

37:47.433 --> 37:48.434
You know,
your Alpha Dog

37:48.467 --> 37:51.470
has finite resources--

37:51.503 --> 37:53.405
weapons, money,
vehicles, manpower.

37:53.439 --> 37:55.874
Now, some of these resources can
be used for more than one job

37:55.907 --> 37:57.876
and others only have
one function.

37:57.909 --> 37:59.478
Because time is
his greatest enemy,

37:59.511 --> 38:00.912
he's going to try to
schedule his tasks

38:00.946 --> 38:02.948
for maximum efficiency,

38:02.981 --> 38:05.617
so that no resource sits idle
if it doesn't have to.

38:06.985 --> 38:08.954
All right, so...

38:08.987 --> 38:10.389
The interesting thing
about scheduling algorithms

38:10.422 --> 38:12.324
is no one has come up
with a perfect one yet.

38:12.358 --> 38:13.825
AMITA:
No, there are thousands.

38:13.859 --> 38:15.961
The Smith rule,
the O2, the Beam search.

38:15.994 --> 38:18.830
Any programmer can design one,
test it, and name it.

38:18.864 --> 38:20.699
CHARLIE: And just like
a programmer's design

38:20.732 --> 38:22.501
or a guitarist's
signature riff or

38:22.534 --> 38:24.002
a painter's
brushstroke,

38:24.035 --> 38:27.906
a scheduling algorithm is
the expression of a unique mind.

38:27.939 --> 38:30.376
It not only shows us the choices
that have been made,

38:30.409 --> 38:32.077
but it hints
at the choices to come--

38:32.110 --> 38:33.645
how he'll play that next chord,

38:33.679 --> 38:36.415
what brushstrokes will follow.

38:36.448 --> 38:38.450
MAN:
Faster, come on, go!

38:38.484 --> 38:39.418
(tires screeching)

38:41.152 --> 38:42.988
Where's the money?!

38:43.021 --> 38:45.691
Get down
on the ground!

38:45.724 --> 38:47.826
FBI!
Don't move!

38:47.859 --> 38:48.860
(over radio):
All units, move in.

38:48.894 --> 38:49.928
AGENT:
Get your hands up now!

38:49.961 --> 38:50.729
Drop your weapon!

38:50.762 --> 38:51.930
(indistinct radio
communication)

38:53.565 --> 38:54.866
Get down
on the ground!

38:54.900 --> 38:56.067
(shouting)

38:56.101 --> 38:58.804
- Let me see your hands!
- Drop it!

38:58.837 --> 39:00.739
AGENT (on radio):
All units, stand down.

39:00.772 --> 39:01.807
Suspects in custody.
Over.

39:06.778 --> 39:07.879
How'd it go?

39:07.913 --> 39:09.581
Should have been there--

39:09.615 --> 39:11.717
bullets flying, cars crashing.
(phone ringing)

39:13.585 --> 39:15.654
(phone ringing)

39:16.788 --> 39:18.890
FBI, Betancourt.

39:18.924 --> 39:20.892
Yeah, one minute, please.

39:26.865 --> 39:29.067
(phone buttons beeping)

39:32.170 --> 39:34.940
So how long am I in trouble for?

39:34.973 --> 39:39.978
Well, um, pre-therapy Don, I
think about three months, easy.

39:40.011 --> 39:42.414
You got post-therapy Don, so...

39:42.448 --> 39:44.783
Yeah, then ten weeks-- 11 tops.

39:44.816 --> 39:45.917
(sighs)

39:45.951 --> 39:47.453
Listen, figure out
how to forward

39:47.486 --> 39:48.587
the calls
to the switchboard

39:48.620 --> 39:49.955
and we'll take you out
for a beer.

39:57.963 --> 40:00.466
(knocking)

40:00.499 --> 40:02.434
- Hey.
- Hey, Don.

40:02.468 --> 40:04.703
Didn't think you came up
to the 11th floor

40:04.736 --> 40:06.838
without an ADIC directive.

40:06.872 --> 40:08.507
Actually, I want to talk to you
a little about Charlie,

40:08.540 --> 40:09.508
if that's okay.

40:09.541 --> 40:10.776
No kidding.

40:10.809 --> 40:14.112
But I think it'd be better if we
wait for the formal interview.

40:14.145 --> 40:15.847
I'm not here to defend him
or anything,

40:15.881 --> 40:16.782
but you know what I mean,

40:16.815 --> 40:18.216
what the guy does
for us around here...

40:18.249 --> 40:19.250
A lot of people
can do.

40:19.284 --> 40:24.556
Not as well, maybe, but...
maybe more reliably.

40:24.590 --> 40:27.058
Yeah, Carl, you've been
out of the field a long time.

40:27.092 --> 40:29.127
And you've been in it
a long time.

40:29.160 --> 40:31.963
Meaning?

40:31.997 --> 40:33.832
Just because it isn't papered

40:33.865 --> 40:35.967
doesn't mean
I don't know about it.

40:36.001 --> 40:39.571
Some questionable tactics,
bureau-mandated therapy,

40:39.605 --> 40:42.608
one of your agents
quitting her job.

40:42.641 --> 40:44.810
Now this thing
with your brother.

40:44.843 --> 40:48.013
I kind of have to wonder what
the hell is going on down there.

40:48.046 --> 40:50.816
Well, an 85% clearance rate.

40:50.849 --> 40:54.486
By any means necessary,
because that's the Eppes way.

40:54.520 --> 40:55.987
Don't think
I didn't hear

40:56.021 --> 40:57.723
about you and your brother
playing cute

40:57.756 --> 41:00.526
with the rules today--
and last week.

41:00.559 --> 41:03.495
But the rules are
for everyone else, aren't they?

41:06.632 --> 41:10.101
You know, Carl, you want to come
after me, fine, come after me,

41:10.135 --> 41:12.838
but just don't make it
about my brother, okay?

41:12.871 --> 41:15.106
Nothing's ever about
one thing, Don.

41:15.140 --> 41:19.545
If you can't see that, maybe
that's where the problem begins.

41:41.066 --> 41:44.836
I could write.

41:44.870 --> 41:47.005
Yeah.

41:47.038 --> 41:48.940
My, my publisher's
been bothering me

41:48.974 --> 41:51.610
to do a follow-up book
anyway, so...

41:51.643 --> 41:53.044
(Amita chuckles)

41:53.078 --> 41:55.547
You hated every minute of it.

41:55.581 --> 41:57.215
Not every minute.

41:57.248 --> 42:01.086
Yesterday, when you and Larry
left me to go work on that case,

42:01.119 --> 42:03.088
it felt like
when I was a little kid,

42:03.121 --> 42:06.024
and I stayed home
sick from school.

42:09.094 --> 42:11.162
(sighs)

42:11.196 --> 42:12.864
I always liked
sick days.

42:12.898 --> 42:16.134
Game shows, soap operas,

42:16.167 --> 42:18.604
chicken soup.

42:18.637 --> 42:20.772
Chicken soup?

42:20.806 --> 42:22.574
Really?

42:22.608 --> 42:23.909
Yeah, really.

42:23.942 --> 42:27.045
(chuckles)

42:27.078 --> 42:29.080
You worked with Don for
four years, Charlie.

42:29.114 --> 42:32.217
You know, of course it's gonna
feel a little bit weird.

42:32.250 --> 42:33.351
Yeah.

42:33.384 --> 42:37.723
I used to-- I've always
looked at my work for the FBI

42:37.756 --> 42:42.694
as... an avocation,
you know?

42:42.728 --> 42:45.631
An occasional detour from...

42:45.664 --> 42:48.066
that grand destiny
that people have been

42:48.099 --> 42:50.902
predicting for me
since I was seven years old.

42:50.936 --> 42:55.140
I even suspected
that it was my excuse

42:55.173 --> 42:57.175
for not fulfilling
that destiny.

43:01.146 --> 43:03.248
I honestly never thought...

43:03.281 --> 43:05.984
I'd miss it so much.

43:13.058 --> 43:14.960
You're gonna get
your clearance back.

43:17.228 --> 43:19.130
I know.
