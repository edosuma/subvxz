00:03.959 --> 00:06.265
These are engineered to
block out any outside noise

00:06.309 --> 00:08.920
and the sound quality is great.

00:08.964 --> 00:11.140
- How much?
- Marked down for $299.

00:14.012 --> 00:16.580
- Yo, hands up.
- Hold up, hold up!

00:16.623 --> 00:18.190
G-Go to headphones, go to headphones.

00:20.323 --> 00:22.891
- Come on, come on.
- Move, move, move, move.

00:22.934 --> 00:24.588
Come on, come on.

00:26.198 --> 00:27.634
Go, go fast!

00:33.162 --> 00:34.293
Come on, come on, yo, get it all, man!

00:34.337 --> 00:36.948
- Come on.
- Let's go, let's go.

00:43.650 --> 00:45.652
Yes, ma'am. We're on it.

00:48.655 --> 00:50.614
Fire started on the first floor.

00:50.657 --> 00:52.007
It's a three-bedroom apartment.

00:52.050 --> 00:54.879
It's under renovation. About 3:30 a.m.

00:54.923 --> 00:56.054
Victims?

00:56.098 --> 00:57.577
Family of four.

00:57.621 --> 00:59.623
They were home at the time.
The landlord got them out,

00:59.666 --> 01:02.278
but the grandfather's at St.
Benjamin's for smoke inhalation.

01:02.321 --> 01:04.105
Cause of fire?

01:04.149 --> 01:06.325
Fire marshal says it's an arson.

01:06.369 --> 01:07.892
There are traces of an accelerant

01:07.936 --> 01:10.025
on an outlet that the
fire originated from.

01:10.068 --> 01:12.723
All right, check with CSU,
see if they lifted

01:12.766 --> 01:15.073
- any other forensic evidence.
- Okay.

01:15.117 --> 01:16.379
And be sure to push them daily

01:16.422 --> 01:18.424
if you want any results
by the end of the year.

01:18.468 --> 01:19.643
It's April.

01:19.686 --> 01:20.774
Exactly.

01:20.818 --> 01:22.341
I can't tell you how honored I am,

01:22.385 --> 01:24.213
to have you showing me
the ropes like this.

01:24.256 --> 01:26.128
Well, take all the time you need

01:26.171 --> 01:28.043
to get it right and you'll do just fine.

01:28.086 --> 01:29.870
Keep your judgements to yourself.

01:29.914 --> 01:31.655
Never share them until they become facts.

01:31.698 --> 01:33.700
Especially to the press.

01:33.744 --> 01:35.485
- This is Mr. McCormick.
- He's the landlord.

01:35.528 --> 01:37.139
He lives upstairs.

01:37.182 --> 01:39.141
This is A.D.A. Erin Reagan.

01:39.184 --> 01:41.273
This is the man who saved the family.

01:41.317 --> 01:43.232
I just did what I could.

01:43.275 --> 01:45.103
We're gonna need to ask you
some routine questions

01:45.147 --> 01:46.278
down at the precinct.

01:46.322 --> 01:48.106
No problem. I'll grab my coat.

01:49.455 --> 01:52.328
Gonna go back to the
precinct with the detectives,

01:52.371 --> 01:54.895
see what this guy's got to say to them.

01:54.939 --> 01:57.811
Okay, good. What?

01:59.030 --> 02:01.685
The grandpa just died from his injuries.

02:03.295 --> 02:06.819
Okay, so arson just became murder.

02:21.531 --> 02:23.228
Sir, don't-don't touch that, please.

02:23.272 --> 02:25.230
Ma'am, if you could
wait just a little bit longer,

02:25.274 --> 02:27.058
we'd like to get a statement from you.

02:31.715 --> 02:32.977
I'm gonna call in Crime Scene.

02:33.021 --> 02:36.024
Let's gather everyone
out front and tape it off.

02:40.724 --> 02:43.161
When the two females entered our ER,
we didn't think the cases

02:43.205 --> 02:45.120
were connected at first,
until we had found evidence

02:45.163 --> 02:46.860
of high doses of, uh, amphetamines

02:46.904 --> 02:48.036
in both their systems.

02:48.079 --> 02:49.776
Any signs of habitual usage?

02:49.820 --> 02:51.778
No, but one of the nurses
recognized them.

02:51.822 --> 02:55.173
Said they were Audrey Leon and
Leah Rooney, well-known models.

02:55.217 --> 02:57.697
Models doing speed?
Like that never happens.

02:57.741 --> 03:00.135
Yeah, I know, but this was
straight Benzedrine.

03:00.178 --> 03:03.094
Wait, straight Benze-what?

03:03.138 --> 03:05.923
A drug for those with severe
Parkinson's or epilepsy.

03:05.966 --> 03:07.098
But to anyone else,

03:07.142 --> 03:08.983
it's a massive overload to the systems.

03:09.027 --> 03:11.348
So these kids using this as
some kind of party drug nowadays?

03:11.391 --> 03:13.018
It'll keep you awake like any stimulant,

03:13.042 --> 03:14.914
but it's also an excellent
tool for weight loss.

03:14.957 --> 03:16.393
Where would they get
their hands on this drug?

03:16.437 --> 03:17.612
I don't know.

03:17.655 --> 03:19.875
I've never seen this strand used before.

03:19.919 --> 03:21.137
Well, any other hospitals
reporting these types

03:21.181 --> 03:22.704
- of overdoses?
- No, not yet.

03:22.747 --> 03:24.488
Hey, but the day's young, huh?

03:25.141 --> 03:27.274
The patient said one last thing
before she lost consciousness.

03:27.317 --> 03:28.492
What's that?

03:29.537 --> 03:30.930
"We were poisoned."

03:43.203 --> 03:44.813
I wouldn't ask you to look into it

03:44.857 --> 03:47.381
if I wasn't totally confident
of the outcome.

03:48.425 --> 03:50.297
Then why ask me?

03:52.125 --> 03:55.911
A priest's word that
another priest is innocent

03:55.955 --> 04:00.133
of predatory behavior
needs supporting evidence.

04:00.176 --> 04:03.266
Yeah, but you're not just
a priest, Your Eminence.

04:03.310 --> 04:06.269
But it's the men in my position
who've had the heaviest hand

04:06.313 --> 04:09.192
in moving the rotten apples
to other barrels.

04:09.751 --> 04:15.496
So, the strength of my word
in these matters is diluted.

04:15.539 --> 04:18.716
Why are you so certain he's so innocent?

04:18.760 --> 04:20.935
And don't lord your office over me.

04:20.980 --> 04:23.852
You want an investigation,
Kevin, we do it my way.

04:23.896 --> 04:25.288
The cop way.

04:27.073 --> 04:28.639
I taught him in the seminary.

04:28.683 --> 04:32.339
I ordained him. I know him.

04:32.382 --> 04:34.123
Frank...

04:34.167 --> 04:37.997
I-I've been doing this
most of my adult life.

04:38.040 --> 04:41.000
And you get so you can tell
the difference between the ones

04:41.043 --> 04:44.090
who enter the priesthood to
fulfill themselves and the ones

04:44.133 --> 04:47.049
who are just looking for a place
to hide from themselves.

04:47.093 --> 04:48.790
The accuser?

04:48.833 --> 04:50.139
Anonymous to us.

04:50.635 --> 04:52.968
But the lawyer's
a well-known ambulance chaser.

04:53.012 --> 04:55.188
And the payouts are famously huge.

04:55.231 --> 04:57.625
And in the legitimate cases,
never enough.

04:59.235 --> 05:01.194
But there's also a concurrent complaint

05:01.237 --> 05:07.156
about his relationship
with a... an 11-year-old boy.

05:11.898 --> 05:14.215
A Sebastian Loomis.

05:15.466 --> 05:17.993
You'll abide by my findings?

05:18.037 --> 05:19.168
Yes.

05:19.212 --> 05:21.605
Even if I unscrew the cap on this thing

05:21.649 --> 05:24.304
and it smells to high heaven?

05:25.541 --> 05:26.760
Yes.

05:46.940 --> 05:54.941
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

06:01.974 --> 06:03.105
Sir!

06:03.447 --> 06:05.967
No, sir, you can't be back here.

06:06.585 --> 06:09.066
Sir, I'm sorry. You can't go in there.

06:09.771 --> 06:11.686
Sir, I have to ask you to leave.

06:11.729 --> 06:12.992
Someone needs to tell me what the hell

06:13.035 --> 06:14.602
- is going on.
- Sure.

06:14.645 --> 06:18.388
We'll take it from here.
Detective Reagan.

06:18.432 --> 06:20.260
My partner, Detective Baez.

06:20.690 --> 06:22.925
D-Detectives? What happened?

06:22.969 --> 06:24.568
That's what we're here to figure out.

06:24.612 --> 06:25.787
Who are you two?

06:25.830 --> 06:27.745
I'm Jules Sarina, this is Samson James.

06:27.789 --> 06:28.921
Yeah, I know.

06:28.964 --> 06:31.175
- $300 T-shirts.
- Ah.

06:31.219 --> 06:33.229
And what's your connection to the girls?

06:33.273 --> 06:34.921
They're models for our line.

06:34.945 --> 06:36.642
And how'd you track them down here?

06:36.686 --> 06:38.775
Well, when they didn't post
on social media from last night

06:38.818 --> 06:40.559
and they didn't show up
to a shoot this morning,

06:40.603 --> 06:41.778
we knew something was up.

06:41.821 --> 06:44.389
You always track down your employees

06:44.433 --> 06:46.347
on social media when they show up late?

06:46.391 --> 06:48.001
Well, these two are MVPs.

06:48.045 --> 06:49.263
Where's Leah?

06:50.264 --> 06:52.353
She passed away this morning.

06:54.390 --> 06:55.574
What?

06:59.186 --> 07:00.449
How?

07:00.492 --> 07:02.451
Overdose. Benzedrine.

07:02.494 --> 07:04.443
So, not your everyday nose candy.

07:04.487 --> 07:05.584
You two have any idea

07:05.628 --> 07:08.195
how these girls could've gotten
their hands on such a drug?

07:08.239 --> 07:09.893
- No.
- You?

07:09.936 --> 07:11.242
No.

07:11.285 --> 07:13.200
What is your relationship to the girls?

07:13.244 --> 07:14.375
I look after them.

07:14.419 --> 07:16.508
- Look after them?
- They're young girls

07:16.552 --> 07:18.568
from small towns in the bright
lights of the big city.

07:18.612 --> 07:20.556
I'm like their den mother.

07:20.599 --> 07:23.036
How about you? You look
after the girls as well?

07:23.080 --> 07:26.257
No, my relationship
is strictly professional.

07:26.300 --> 07:28.477
How about your other
relationships? They professional?

07:28.520 --> 07:29.652
Yes, of course.

07:29.695 --> 07:31.218
And please stop trying to rattle us.

07:31.262 --> 07:33.351
Believe it or not,
this is a huge personal loss

07:33.394 --> 07:34.430
to both of us.

07:36.111 --> 07:37.161
We may not have been

07:37.204 --> 07:39.009
their family,
but we are still their family.

07:39.052 --> 07:41.881
Were family, sadly to say.

07:42.563 --> 07:44.579
Yes. Were.

07:44.622 --> 07:46.146
Now, if you'll excuse me,

07:46.190 --> 07:47.931
I'd like to make contact
with their parents.

07:47.974 --> 07:50.368
Actually, we'd like
to make the notification.

07:50.411 --> 07:51.948
And then you can call them.

07:52.544 --> 07:54.415
Hang on... Sarge!

07:54.459 --> 07:55.993
Hey.

07:58.202 --> 07:59.812
- This is Mia Martinez.
- She was at the door

07:59.856 --> 08:01.118
when the perps entered.

08:01.161 --> 08:03.381
But like I said, I didn't see much.

08:03.424 --> 08:04.904
We're hearing the looters
are between 13 and 18.

08:04.948 --> 08:06.079
Can you confirm that?

08:06.123 --> 08:08.168
- Well, what'd you expect?
- Excuse me?

08:08.212 --> 08:10.710
Teachers have been on strike
for what, three weeks now?

08:10.754 --> 08:12.999
You're saying that they committed
a robbery to fill their free time?

08:13.043 --> 08:14.871
Idle hands lead to no good.

08:14.914 --> 08:16.525
Especially for these kinds of kids.

08:16.568 --> 08:18.222
What kind of kids is that?

08:18.265 --> 08:21.094
Just disadvantaged kids, the
kind fell through the cracks,

08:21.138 --> 08:22.531
same as it ever was.

08:22.574 --> 08:24.402
You got all that from them running by?

08:24.445 --> 08:27.057
I'm a social worker.
I can see it in an instant.

08:27.100 --> 08:30.364
Right, so you can tell us what
they looked like. Gender? Race?

08:30.408 --> 08:31.408
Mixed, I guess.

08:31.433 --> 08:33.498
- I got out as soon as I could.
- Why?

08:33.542 --> 08:36.283
You ever been ran at
by a mob of teenagers?

08:36.327 --> 08:37.589
What did you see?

08:37.633 --> 08:41.288
Bunch of kids never had a chance
running past me.

08:45.554 --> 08:47.294
Thank you.

08:47.338 --> 08:49.296
A.D.A. Wilson, can you
comment on the fire?

08:49.340 --> 08:51.255
You'll have to speak with the
fire marshal about the arson.

08:51.298 --> 08:53.213
Uh... Oh, it's been ruled arson?

08:53.257 --> 08:54.606
I... Uh...

08:54.650 --> 08:56.173
Is the building owner being charged?

08:56.216 --> 08:58.436
No. Dan McCormick is a hero.

08:58.479 --> 09:00.351
So you're suggesting
the family started the fire?

09:00.394 --> 09:02.396
I...

09:05.269 --> 09:07.445
I specifically told her
not to talk to the press,

09:07.488 --> 09:09.969
and the first chance she gets,
she compromises the case.

09:10.013 --> 09:11.754
Looks like she was ambushed.

09:11.797 --> 09:13.277
The D.A. wants her fired.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.061
Is that what you're gonna do?

09:15.105 --> 09:16.846
I don't know.

09:20.782 --> 09:23.088
Baker's not at her post.

09:23.113 --> 09:24.549
She's out of the office this morning,

09:24.593 --> 09:26.638
but I had her clear your schedule first.

09:26.682 --> 09:28.814
- You did?
- Yes.

09:28.858 --> 09:31.425
- We waiting on Garrett?
- No. Just us.

09:32.470 --> 09:34.167
Everything okay?

09:34.211 --> 09:35.952
I want you to look into that.

09:38.632 --> 09:39.738
Ay, ay, ay.

09:40.048 --> 09:41.353
There a problem?

09:42.436 --> 09:44.351
Well, boss, I know
we don't talk about it much,

09:44.395 --> 09:45.701
but I'm a Catholic.

09:45.744 --> 09:47.354
So am I.

09:47.398 --> 09:50.314
Not every Sunday, but a lot
of Sundays for a lot of years.

09:50.357 --> 09:52.026
So?

09:52.232 --> 09:55.845
So I'm-I'm uncomfortable
looking into a priest.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.539
So am I.

10:00.076 --> 10:02.662
Could you maybe
choose an atheist for this?

10:03.270 --> 10:06.404
Robbie Dupont over at SVU?
He's a big-time atheist.

10:06.722 --> 10:08.680
You're also white, Irish and male.

10:08.724 --> 10:10.073
Would you feel uncomfortable

10:10.116 --> 10:12.466
investigating another white Irish male?

10:12.510 --> 10:14.643
- Well, no, but...
- Then cut it out.

10:14.686 --> 10:18.429
The archbishop asked me
and I am giving it to you.

10:18.472 --> 10:20.474
Well, what's the outcome
we're looking for?

10:20.518 --> 10:22.215
The truth. The whole truth.

10:22.259 --> 10:23.347
And nothing but?

10:23.390 --> 10:25.131
If the accusations

10:25.175 --> 10:27.481
appear to have merit,
we will investigate further.

10:27.525 --> 10:29.440
If they do not,
we need to muscle a lawyer

10:29.483 --> 10:32.748
to step away from
a clearly fraudulent claim.

10:32.791 --> 10:33.792
Who's the lawyer?

10:33.836 --> 10:35.446
Uh, works out of Yonkers.

10:35.489 --> 10:36.447
It's in there.

10:36.490 --> 10:38.101
Ambulance chaser?

10:38.364 --> 10:39.510
Maybe.

10:39.553 --> 10:43.497
Or maybe just a noble crusader
for victims' rights.

10:43.541 --> 10:44.673
Go see what's what.

10:47.915 --> 10:49.291
And Sid?

10:50.636 --> 10:53.003
This stays between us.

10:55.047 --> 10:56.728
Copy that, boss.

11:05.302 --> 11:07.870
A.D.A. Wilson. Do you want her?

11:08.914 --> 11:10.350
I'm confused.

11:10.394 --> 11:12.352
Word is Detective Abetemarco's
looking into my case.

11:12.396 --> 11:16.530
At my request. And it's not your
case like those are your shoes.

11:18.532 --> 11:21.710
- Talking to the press like that?
- Way out of line.

11:21.753 --> 11:23.755
Uh, I was blindsided. I didn't... I...

11:23.799 --> 11:27.193
Hence the phrase
"No comment at this time."

11:27.237 --> 11:30.588
You gave away information
on a preliminary investigation.

11:31.250 --> 11:33.373
Okay, so I can't, but you can?

11:34.635 --> 11:36.550
Excuse me?

11:36.594 --> 11:38.552
Uh, 2009, Brown v. The City of New York.

11:38.596 --> 11:39.771
You called out to the press

11:39.815 --> 11:41.381
for the whereabouts of Brown's sister.

11:41.425 --> 11:43.601
Who was a person of interest
and in the wind.

11:43.644 --> 11:45.385
Who turned out to be a dead end.

11:45.429 --> 11:49.041
Totally different. And is that
where your bar is set?

11:49.085 --> 11:52.305
"Maybe it's a dead end,
but, hey, I got on TV"?

11:52.349 --> 11:53.480
It worked for you.

11:55.265 --> 11:57.860
What exactly are you implying?

11:58.442 --> 12:00.705
I'm just trying to follow your lead.

12:00.749 --> 12:02.098
Of all the attorneys in this building,

12:02.141 --> 12:03.795
you're the one who
I can learn the most from.

12:03.839 --> 12:04.970
Well, maybe you should learn that we work

12:05.014 --> 12:06.711
for the people of New York City.

12:06.755 --> 12:09.888
That it's our job to find
justice for victims,

12:09.932 --> 12:11.166
not muddy the waters.

12:11.210 --> 12:12.412
I'm not trying to muddy any waters.

12:12.456 --> 12:14.251
You're out of your league here.

12:15.336 --> 12:17.983
Sorry, but I'm feeling really undermined.

12:18.027 --> 12:19.593
Professionally and personally.

12:19.637 --> 12:23.052
Well, your feelings
don't really factor in.

12:28.177 --> 12:29.744
You're off the case.

12:45.495 --> 12:47.323
Mr. James?

12:47.936 --> 12:49.111
What are you doing here?

12:49.154 --> 12:50.460
We came to look for you.

12:51.088 --> 12:52.411
It's called "Anonymous," you know?

12:52.455 --> 12:53.761
Couple hours before

12:53.804 --> 12:56.807
two young girls overdosed,
you were photographed

12:57.595 --> 12:59.984
walking out of a nightclub
with one on each arm.

13:00.028 --> 13:01.420
What are you implying?

13:01.464 --> 13:03.858
I'm implying that you know
more than you're telling us.

13:03.901 --> 13:05.076
'Cause if you really cared

13:05.120 --> 13:07.731
about those girls
the way you say you did,

13:07.775 --> 13:09.341
you'd know what they were taking.

13:09.385 --> 13:10.865
And you'd know who supplied them with it.

13:10.908 --> 13:13.084
I put them in a cab and I went home.

13:13.128 --> 13:14.608
Who's their dealer?

13:14.651 --> 13:16.305
I don't know.

13:25.720 --> 13:26.938
They knew exactly what to grab.

13:26.963 --> 13:28.861
Must have got out with
upwards of $50,000.

13:28.917 --> 13:31.223
How did a bunch of kids organize this?

13:32.528 --> 13:34.440
It's actually kind of impressive, right?

13:38.511 --> 13:40.111
Wait a sec. Is this Mia?

13:41.199 --> 13:42.331
Yeah. What's she...

13:48.122 --> 13:51.125
She's yelling at them.
Almost like she knows them.

13:51.615 --> 13:53.487
She ain't calling 911.

13:54.424 --> 13:55.820
What is this?

13:57.825 --> 14:00.567
A lady with a story full of holes.

14:01.657 --> 14:03.398
The accelerant was acetone.

14:03.442 --> 14:04.787
Nail polish remover?

14:04.812 --> 14:07.540
Which, as you know,
is sold at every drug store everywhere.

14:08.621 --> 14:10.623
It was thrown into the outlet and ignited

14:10.666 --> 14:12.140
to look like an electrical fire.

14:12.165 --> 14:13.123
Fingerprints?

14:13.177 --> 14:14.309
Nada.

14:14.453 --> 14:17.586
So, who are our suspects?

14:17.630 --> 14:19.675
Someone who had access to the apartment.

14:19.719 --> 14:22.809
Uh, apparently, there were
no signs of forced entry

14:22.852 --> 14:24.201
and no open windows.

14:24.245 --> 14:25.594
Who had access?

14:25.638 --> 14:27.204
The contractor and the landlord.

14:27.248 --> 14:30.120
Dan McCormick, our professed hero?

14:30.164 --> 14:31.600
Apparently, he's in the red and, uh,

14:31.644 --> 14:34.124
stands to make a bundle from insurance.

14:34.525 --> 14:36.126
You think he did it?

14:36.170 --> 14:37.479
My best guess?

14:37.522 --> 14:40.392
He's either covering his ass
with whoever was responsible...

14:40.435 --> 14:43.003
Or our white knight

14:43.046 --> 14:46.077
is both our arsonist and our firefighter.

14:46.102 --> 14:47.800
Exactly.

14:53.143 --> 14:55.058
So you never left the store.

14:55.102 --> 14:56.799
Why would you tell us that you did?

14:56.843 --> 14:58.080
And you're yelling at these kids

14:58.124 --> 14:59.802
like you're their mother.

15:00.924 --> 15:02.404
Because you know them, don't you?

15:02.429 --> 15:03.597
You work with them?

15:03.719 --> 15:04.981
No.

15:05.025 --> 15:07.723
If you think you're protecting them,
you're not.

15:08.392 --> 15:10.639
You don't know what some
of these kids been through.

15:11.672 --> 15:13.112
This isn't about
what they've been through,

15:13.137 --> 15:14.617
this is about what
they did in that store.

15:14.861 --> 15:18.560
No, it's about what's been done to them,
by the system.

15:18.604 --> 15:20.649
All right. I want the names of the kids

15:20.693 --> 15:22.031
that you were yelling at.

15:31.345 --> 15:34.304
Hi. Just curious how the case is going.

15:34.329 --> 15:36.200
You ever track down who set that fire?

15:36.225 --> 15:39.446
Yep. Followed the trail
right to Dan McCormick.

15:40.582 --> 15:41.975
Dan McCormick is a hero.

15:42.018 --> 15:45.413
- Only 'cause you called him one.
- He started that fire.

15:45.457 --> 15:48.721
That's why he was able
to save them so quickly.

15:51.288 --> 15:54.079
- I had it all wrong.
- No wonder she's so pissed at me.

15:54.104 --> 15:56.232
Not to mention that you
specifically disregarded

15:56.257 --> 15:58.525
her instructions
not to talk to the press.

15:59.862 --> 16:01.168
How do I fix this?

16:01.211 --> 16:02.605
I don't want to get in the middle.

16:02.648 --> 16:05.651
Everyone warned me that she is...

16:05.694 --> 16:06.739
What, a bitch?

16:06.782 --> 16:09.089
I was gonna say "tough."

16:09.132 --> 16:11.308
I like to call it having high standards,

16:11.352 --> 16:12.894
which you did not live up to.

16:12.918 --> 16:14.833
I made a mistake. I get it.

16:14.877 --> 16:16.444
I don't think you do.

16:16.487 --> 16:18.228
She was supposed to fire you today.

16:18.272 --> 16:21.797
Yeah, a-and the only reason
you're still here is because,

16:21.840 --> 16:25.583
for whatever reason,
she decided to give you another chance.

16:27.972 --> 16:29.323
I didn't know that.

16:29.417 --> 16:31.183
Yeah, well, now you do.

16:33.548 --> 16:34.853
What can I do?

16:36.507 --> 16:39.858
First of all, you're gonna
have to admit to your mistake.

16:39.902 --> 16:42.513
With me, it usually comes
with a bottle of good whiskey,

16:42.557 --> 16:44.385
but that's gonna look
too familiar on you.

16:44.428 --> 16:45.603
Maybe there's something else she likes?

16:47.366 --> 16:49.172
I mean, I don't know.
Get her some chocolate

16:49.215 --> 16:52.175
from her favorite store,
the Brooklyn Chocolate Room.

16:52.218 --> 16:54.656
She likes salted caramel.

16:54.699 --> 16:55.831
Got it.

16:55.874 --> 16:58.573
And maybe write her an apology letter.

16:58.616 --> 16:59.878
That way you can say what you mean

16:59.922 --> 17:01.619
without getting all tongue-tied

17:01.663 --> 17:03.491
'cause of the truly terrifying
looks she shoots

17:03.534 --> 17:05.536
when she's not happy with you.

17:05.579 --> 17:07.103
Okay. Anything else?

17:08.500 --> 17:10.023
Grovel.

17:11.715 --> 17:13.152
Three more people died last night

17:13.195 --> 17:15.546
because of this bad batch.
That's five total!

17:15.589 --> 17:17.722
Now you need to start
being straight with us.

17:17.766 --> 17:19.202
Three more?

17:19.244 --> 17:21.551
- And counting.
- So what's it gonna be?

17:21.596 --> 17:23.554
You want more blood on your
hands or are you gonna work with us?

17:24.028 --> 17:25.599
I'll tell you whatever you want to know.

17:25.643 --> 17:27.515
Start by giving us
the name of the dealer.

17:27.558 --> 17:28.994
What makes you so sure I know it?

17:29.038 --> 17:31.127
You're the den mother.
You said so yourself.

17:31.170 --> 17:32.998
That doesn't mean I know
who they got their drugs from.

17:33.042 --> 17:34.783
Well, then, you know somebody who knows.

17:34.826 --> 17:36.350
Come on. A-A boyfriend,

17:36.393 --> 17:38.656
a personal trainer, somebody.

17:38.700 --> 17:40.571
Let me ask you a question first.

17:40.615 --> 17:42.791
You don't ask us the questions.
We're asking you questions.

17:42.834 --> 17:44.532
There are lives on the line here.

17:44.575 --> 17:45.837
If I give you a name,

17:45.881 --> 17:48.362
do you swear to leave me alone
going forward?

17:48.776 --> 17:50.189
Well, I'll put it to you this way:

17:50.233 --> 17:52.104
if you have a name and
you don't give it to us,

17:52.148 --> 17:53.584
we're gonna make your
life hell going forward.

17:53.628 --> 17:54.890
- How's that sound?
- Danny...

17:54.933 --> 17:57.153
No, a 15-year-old girl
is the latest victim.

17:57.196 --> 18:00.286
Okay? We need to find this guy!

18:02.941 --> 18:04.777
Scooter Smith.

18:05.161 --> 18:07.685
I have his contact in my phone in my bag.

18:07.729 --> 18:08.904
Good.

18:13.786 --> 18:17.784
So, there isn't a shred of
evidence that Father Kennelly

18:17.828 --> 18:19.654
is guilty of predatory behavior

18:19.697 --> 18:22.265
with young males now or in the past.

18:22.669 --> 18:24.006
I knew it.

18:25.529 --> 18:26.922
But...

18:32.797 --> 18:37.454
...he does have
a very unusual relationship

18:37.498 --> 18:40.762
with the 11-year-old Sebastian Loomis.

18:41.480 --> 18:42.677
You just said...

18:42.720 --> 18:44.113
It's not that.

18:46.887 --> 18:51.115
We believe Father Kennelly
may be the boy's father.

18:56.299 --> 18:57.474
And the mother?

18:57.518 --> 18:59.041
Works at the parish rectory,

18:59.084 --> 19:02.334
as she did in his two previous parishes.

19:04.314 --> 19:08.579
Is there evidence that there's
anything less than consensual?

19:08.966 --> 19:10.748
No.

19:10.792 --> 19:14.054
But we haven't interviewed
either the mother or the father.

19:14.676 --> 19:16.808
The boy attends the parish school,

19:16.833 --> 19:18.400
is an altar boy at church

19:18.425 --> 19:20.471
and spends a lot of time with his father,

19:20.496 --> 19:23.804
which is what raised the eyebrows.

19:26.198 --> 19:27.939
Couldn't you just have told me

19:27.983 --> 19:29.985
that he's innocent of what I asked?

19:30.028 --> 19:32.352
Is that what you really wanted, Kevin?

19:32.377 --> 19:34.422
You always go above and beyond.

19:37.340 --> 19:39.079
What are you gonna do?

19:41.692 --> 19:44.334
The community will be crushed, but...

19:45.174 --> 19:47.393
there's nothing else I can do.

19:48.438 --> 19:49.700
You're sending him away?

19:49.744 --> 19:51.441
You don't give me a choice.

19:51.485 --> 19:52.532
I don't?

19:52.576 --> 19:54.013
The information.

19:54.057 --> 19:56.113
Hey, we don't have all the information.

19:56.156 --> 19:57.534
We have enough.

19:57.578 --> 20:00.476
Not for a decision like this, you don't.

20:20.813 --> 20:22.675
You have a visitor, Father.

20:25.844 --> 20:28.603
Commissioner Reagan.

20:30.039 --> 20:33.519
Sorry to, uh, just show up like this.

20:34.174 --> 20:36.355
Not at all. I, uh...

20:37.046 --> 20:38.831
Please, sit.

20:41.195 --> 20:42.370
Coffee?

20:42.454 --> 20:43.759
I'm good.

20:45.269 --> 20:46.573
Thank you.

20:47.421 --> 20:49.684
Angelique, please join us.

20:53.628 --> 20:56.917
I'm a little confused.

20:57.123 --> 20:58.690
How do you know her name?

21:06.641 --> 21:08.600
I know her name.

21:09.936 --> 21:12.286
I know her son's name, too.

21:18.027 --> 21:19.333
I know.

21:23.979 --> 21:25.590
You understand?

21:27.488 --> 21:28.949
Yes.

21:29.795 --> 21:32.188
Look, I'm not a cop, strictly speaking.

21:32.232 --> 21:34.974
A police commissioner
cannot be a sworn member

21:35.017 --> 21:36.707
of the department.

21:38.225 --> 21:41.185
And I'm not here because
I think you broke the law.

21:42.979 --> 21:44.590
Our law, anyway.

21:45.193 --> 21:47.152
I understand.

21:48.850 --> 21:50.888
But I was a cop.

21:51.512 --> 21:54.820
I was a detective for a long time,

21:54.863 --> 21:58.084
which means I sat on your side

21:58.127 --> 22:01.148
of the confessional for years.

22:01.666 --> 22:04.756
Which means I've got
a pretty good instinct

22:04.781 --> 22:07.784
for knowing when
I'm getting the whole story...

22:09.930 --> 22:11.617
...and when I'm not.

22:19.168 --> 22:20.169
So...

22:23.290 --> 22:26.064
I betrayed my vows for a short period

22:26.112 --> 22:27.722
12 years ago.

22:27.766 --> 22:31.247
What's that mean, you betrayed
your vows for a short period?

22:32.304 --> 22:36.209
I had a brief sexual
relationship with Angelique.

22:41.405 --> 22:42.493
Consensual?

22:42.518 --> 22:44.259
Completely.

22:44.284 --> 22:45.633
If anything, it was my doing.

22:45.658 --> 22:47.356
- Angelique...
- My fault.

22:48.195 --> 22:51.115
We agreed we had to separate our lives.

22:51.502 --> 22:53.373
I returned to Dominica, where I realized

22:53.398 --> 22:55.095
I was pregnant with Sebastian.

22:55.358 --> 22:56.838
Couple years went by,

22:57.329 --> 22:59.706
and I had the idea
Father should meet him.

23:00.799 --> 23:01.756
It was a mistake.

23:01.781 --> 23:03.168
Not to me.

23:04.741 --> 23:07.179
We never had relations again.

23:07.936 --> 23:09.299
But...

23:11.051 --> 23:14.116
...everyone thinks the vow of celibacy,

23:14.160 --> 23:16.682
of no sex, is the biggest hurdle.

23:17.299 --> 23:20.868
And for a time, when you're young, it is.

23:21.080 --> 23:24.387
But there's a bigger hurdle
that you couldn't know about

23:24.431 --> 23:25.650
when you were young.

23:27.258 --> 23:30.086
Watching a dad shoot hoops with his boy.

23:31.595 --> 23:35.903
The goofy standing ovation
at his daughter's recital.

23:37.009 --> 23:40.456
Never knowing that blessing.

23:43.058 --> 23:47.846
That was... is...

23:47.889 --> 23:50.466
for me, insurmountable.

23:55.392 --> 23:57.347
I could only imagine.

24:02.208 --> 24:05.024
Did you really think no one
would ever figure it out?

24:05.067 --> 24:06.773
Think it? No.

24:07.343 --> 24:08.734
Not really.

24:10.172 --> 24:12.653
Prayed for it, yes.

24:16.510 --> 24:19.244
May I ask who sent you?

24:23.876 --> 24:26.313
Someone who cares about you.

24:29.714 --> 24:31.846
We'll need a phone number for your mom.

24:31.890 --> 24:33.241
- Why?
- She'll need to come in.

24:33.284 --> 24:34.410
We haven't seen our mom...

24:34.453 --> 24:36.553
- Man, shut up!
- Hey, bro, chill.

24:36.995 --> 24:38.562
You gonna call Child Services?

24:38.587 --> 24:40.331
Should I call Child Services?

24:40.356 --> 24:42.227
- No.
- Your dad around?

24:42.640 --> 24:44.642
He's at work, in North Carolina.

24:44.667 --> 24:46.157
We would like to speak to an adult.

24:46.182 --> 24:47.706
I am an adult. I'm 18.

24:47.731 --> 24:49.603
Okay, then you can come with me.

24:52.051 --> 24:54.619
- Let's go.
- Wait.

24:54.644 --> 24:56.559
Can my brother come, too?

24:56.584 --> 24:58.542
He's a juvenile.

24:58.567 --> 25:00.133
I won't talk without him.

25:01.854 --> 25:04.204
Then you better start talking. Come on.

25:07.888 --> 25:09.150
Scooter Smith.

25:09.194 --> 25:11.718
They found two kilos in coffee cans

25:11.762 --> 25:13.459
in the freezer in your apartment.

25:13.503 --> 25:14.852
That's real weight.

25:14.895 --> 25:16.160
Yeah, laugh it up.

25:16.203 --> 25:17.507
That all we've found so far.

25:17.550 --> 25:18.916
It's not mine.

25:18.960 --> 25:20.120
Really?

25:20.163 --> 25:22.307
I hope you're good
at your job, Counsellor.

25:23.077 --> 25:24.560
You should play ball.

25:25.686 --> 25:27.168
What do you want?

25:27.212 --> 25:29.012
Those two girls buy the drugs themselves?

25:29.055 --> 25:30.998
Audrey and Leah.
Or was there a go-between?

25:31.042 --> 25:32.217
Who and who?

25:32.260 --> 25:34.536
Audrey Leon and Leah Rooney.
The two victims.

25:34.580 --> 25:36.709
No, no, I never heard of them, I swear.

25:36.752 --> 25:38.310
Then who bought the drugs?

25:38.353 --> 25:41.052
- The lady.
- What lady?

25:41.095 --> 25:43.054
The lady. The one that
called me with the heads-up.

25:43.097 --> 25:44.447
That we were on our way?

25:46.528 --> 25:48.451
Jules Sarina?

25:50.094 --> 25:51.095
Yeah.

25:53.020 --> 25:54.500
She know we picked you up?

25:54.525 --> 25:56.657
She'll figure because
she can't get a hold of me.

25:56.721 --> 25:59.386
Okay. Give me a sec.

26:00.245 --> 26:02.203
- Sit on that one.
- You got it.

26:02.247 --> 26:04.141
Son of a bitch.

26:04.166 --> 26:05.320
Hey, it was Jules.

26:05.851 --> 26:07.148
So she's probably on the move.

26:07.192 --> 26:10.516
If she knows we know,
she's definitely on the move.

26:17.874 --> 26:19.090
Hi.

26:19.133 --> 26:21.092
- Hi.
- I'm not sure

26:21.135 --> 26:23.356
if it's important at all,
but Dan McCormick thought

26:23.399 --> 26:25.247
that the family wasn't home
at the time of the fire.

26:25.291 --> 26:26.793
They were supposed to be
away that weekend.

26:26.837 --> 26:28.200
How do you know that?

26:28.244 --> 26:30.936
When I was still on the case,
I interviewed his secretary,

26:30.979 --> 26:32.389
and I gave her my card.

26:32.432 --> 26:34.254
She just reached out to me.

26:34.821 --> 26:37.215
I let her know I'm not
on the case anymore,

26:37.240 --> 26:38.545
and I referred her to you.

26:39.343 --> 26:41.460
Okay, I'll follow up. Thank you.

26:41.504 --> 26:44.701
Okay, um, here is her number.

26:44.744 --> 26:48.554
And I... wrote you a letter.

26:48.598 --> 26:50.103
A letter?

26:50.600 --> 26:53.428
Saying how sorry I am
for totally screwing up.

26:56.673 --> 27:01.156
Uh, I'm the first person in my family

27:01.226 --> 27:02.532
to graduate college,

27:02.557 --> 27:04.701
never mind become a lawyer,

27:05.030 --> 27:06.995
and my parents are really proud.

27:07.986 --> 27:12.121
So if I had been fired, um...

27:13.511 --> 27:16.248
Just... Thank you for
giving me another chance.

27:16.273 --> 27:18.362
I won't let you down again.

27:26.592 --> 27:29.116
And you don't know anyone else
who was involved?

27:29.160 --> 27:30.117
Nope.

27:30.161 --> 27:31.395
You neither?

27:31.438 --> 27:32.946
How many times we gotta say it?

27:32.990 --> 27:35.732
No more times. That's it.

27:36.602 --> 27:38.146
- That's it?
- Yeah.

27:38.190 --> 27:39.518
Now you both go into the system.

27:39.561 --> 27:42.652
- Together?
- No. Adult, juvie.

27:44.582 --> 27:46.105
Ask you one last thing, though.

27:46.482 --> 27:48.484
What'd you guys get for
those Leicas that you lifted?

27:48.509 --> 27:49.902
I didn't lift no...

27:50.036 --> 27:51.516
- What?
- Leicas.

27:51.541 --> 27:53.020
Cameras.

27:53.045 --> 27:55.749
Got you on tape toting more
than $30,000 worth of Leicas

27:55.774 --> 27:58.217
- out of there.
- Oh, no.

27:58.242 --> 28:00.070
I don't think they knew
what they had, Sarge.

28:00.095 --> 28:01.183
30 grand?!

28:01.208 --> 28:02.291
On the street?

28:02.316 --> 28:05.065
No, on the street, more like eight.

28:05.109 --> 28:06.980
Seven, eight each.

28:07.024 --> 28:09.287
Last chance, you guys.

28:09.330 --> 28:11.727
Somebody give you a shopping list?

28:13.683 --> 28:16.414
- Yeah. And the layout of the store.
- Man, shut up!

28:16.458 --> 28:18.520
Nah, bro, I'm not about to
let us take the fall for her.

28:18.545 --> 28:19.568
For who?

28:20.472 --> 28:21.778
It was Mia.

28:22.112 --> 28:23.954
From the community center?

28:24.406 --> 28:27.117
Bitch gave us $100 on eight grand.

28:28.577 --> 28:30.245
You want to pay her back?

28:30.415 --> 28:31.788
I got this.

28:32.831 --> 28:34.374
We catch a break?

28:35.915 --> 28:39.838
You tell us everything you know,
and I will talk to the D.A.

28:42.712 --> 28:44.975
- Okay.
- Okay.

28:45.018 --> 28:46.344
All right.

28:54.347 --> 28:56.698
So McCormick had motive and opportunity.

28:56.741 --> 28:58.204
Well, I need evidence.

28:58.248 --> 29:00.360
Yeah, well,
there were cameras on the first floor

29:00.403 --> 29:03.360
which probably recorded
whoever went into the apartment

29:03.403 --> 29:05.781
- to start the fire.
- That's great.

29:05.816 --> 29:08.592
Yeah, but supposedly,
the system wasn't operational

29:08.892 --> 29:10.285
because they were upgrading it.

29:10.310 --> 29:11.616
That's convenient.

29:11.641 --> 29:14.949
Yeah. And the upgrade
coincides with Wilson

29:14.974 --> 29:17.834
dropping the bomb
that the fire was arson.

29:18.442 --> 29:21.087
McCormick knows we got nothing.

29:21.316 --> 29:23.056
Maybe not.

29:23.100 --> 29:24.449
What do you mean?

29:24.474 --> 29:27.172
It means I have an idea,
but that would require you

29:27.197 --> 29:29.123
being a really good actor.

29:29.148 --> 29:31.226
Yeah, well, good luck with that.

29:31.459 --> 29:33.983
I'm telling you it's a waste of time.

29:34.008 --> 29:35.401
She's in the wind.

29:35.650 --> 29:37.042
You want to sign off

29:37.067 --> 29:39.167
on paperwork says we
didn't check her residence?

29:39.192 --> 29:40.498
I'm just saying...

29:40.523 --> 29:42.481
Her cell phone still pings from home.

29:42.506 --> 29:44.421
Well, maybe she's smart
enough to leave it at home,

29:44.446 --> 29:45.969
because if she is on the run,

29:45.994 --> 29:48.031
she knows that's the only way
we could track her.

29:50.578 --> 29:52.271
Ms. Sarina?

29:52.296 --> 29:54.254
Ms. Sarina,
it's Detectives Reagan and Baez!

30:11.120 --> 30:12.643
She's still warm... get her down.

30:12.687 --> 30:14.819
Come on. Cut her.

30:14.863 --> 30:16.734
Cut her.

30:21.609 --> 30:23.045
Get a bus, get a bus!

30:53.598 --> 30:55.197
Thank you for coming in.

30:56.427 --> 30:57.929
I don't know why I'm here.

30:57.972 --> 30:59.743
I've already answered all your questions.

30:59.767 --> 31:02.117
Well, the thing is, we
got some new information.

31:02.579 --> 31:04.336
Detectives found security footage

31:04.380 --> 31:06.552
of you entering the apartment.

31:07.376 --> 31:09.690
- No, there's no security footage.
- I told you already...

31:09.733 --> 31:11.300
Well, the security footage we have

31:11.343 --> 31:13.158
are not from your cameras.

31:13.549 --> 31:15.011
I don't know what you're talking about.

31:16.635 --> 31:18.362
This was in the Martins' apartment.

31:18.785 --> 31:19.786
Know what it is?

31:19.947 --> 31:21.408
A clock?

31:22.307 --> 31:24.434
It's a nanny cam.

31:25.195 --> 31:27.240
Pretending to be a clock.

31:27.729 --> 31:29.721
You see, the Martins
were supposed to go away

31:29.765 --> 31:32.564
this weekend,
so they set up a hidden camera

31:32.608 --> 31:34.334
to keep an eye on the renovations.

31:34.378 --> 31:37.430
And it picked you up
throwing a flammable liquid

31:37.473 --> 31:40.645
into the electrical socket,
and igniting it.

31:42.889 --> 31:44.037
So...

31:44.954 --> 31:46.520
...you can keep lying to us

31:46.564 --> 31:49.175
or you can come clean and
tell us what really happened.

31:50.669 --> 31:53.223
I wouldn't intentionally hurt someone.

31:53.266 --> 31:54.746
You thought they were
gonna be out of town

31:54.790 --> 31:56.966
when you lit the fire.

31:57.009 --> 31:59.957
I swear to you... I didn't know.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.972
As soon as I realized they were home,

32:03.015 --> 32:04.843
I ran in to get them.

32:04.887 --> 32:06.768
I'm so sorry.

32:40.096 --> 32:41.532
Anthony said you wanted to see me?

32:41.575 --> 32:43.664
Dan McCormick was in the red.

32:43.708 --> 32:46.755
Thought that he was better off
with the insurance money,

32:46.798 --> 32:48.669
so when he thought the Martin family

32:48.713 --> 32:49.801
was supposed to be out of town,

32:49.845 --> 32:52.673
he lit the place to save a buck.

32:52.717 --> 32:56.035
Solid motive, but a little
less heroic, wouldn't you say?

32:56.082 --> 32:57.040
Yes.

32:57.486 --> 32:58.941
We arrested him

32:58.984 --> 33:01.160
on arson and felony murder.

33:01.204 --> 33:02.466
Does that sound about right to you?

33:02.509 --> 33:03.684
Yes.

33:04.409 --> 33:06.339
Your information about McCormick

33:06.383 --> 33:09.473
wanting to make sure everyone
was out of town that weekend

33:09.516 --> 33:11.692
actually helped us break the story.

33:11.736 --> 33:13.710
I'm glad I could do something right.

33:15.587 --> 33:16.959
Wait.

33:20.050 --> 33:22.768
Your letter was sincere,

33:23.178 --> 33:25.299
unsparing and appreciated.

33:25.847 --> 33:27.065
I am glad...

33:27.090 --> 33:29.312
Never put yourself
in a position where you have

33:29.337 --> 33:30.823
to write one like that again.

33:30.979 --> 33:33.626
- Okay.
- You can't write regrets

33:33.670 --> 33:36.149
to the survivor of a crime
the perp walked on

33:36.174 --> 33:37.436
because of your mistakes.

33:37.461 --> 33:38.933
And you can't write "I'm sorry"

33:38.958 --> 33:41.186
to the person who was
wrongfully imprisoned

33:41.211 --> 33:43.039
because of your mistakes.

33:43.315 --> 33:44.881
I've tried both.

33:44.906 --> 33:46.410
No one wants to hear it.

33:46.994 --> 33:48.517
Get it right the first time

33:48.542 --> 33:50.152
or find another line of work.

33:50.177 --> 33:52.135
There are no mulligans here.

33:52.160 --> 33:54.478
- Okay.
- And take

33:54.503 --> 33:57.564
Anthony's advice on etiquette
with a grain of salt.

34:00.129 --> 34:01.870
Thank you, Ms. Reagan.

34:01.895 --> 34:03.723
The arraignment is in 20 minutes.

34:03.748 --> 34:04.790
Would you like to come?

34:05.137 --> 34:06.847
I would be honored.

34:07.363 --> 34:10.148
Try not to look surprised at anything.

34:10.192 --> 34:12.107
It broadcasts that you're a rookie.

34:12.150 --> 34:13.645
I'll go get my coat.

34:19.021 --> 34:21.067
You invited her to the arraignment,
didn't you?

34:21.092 --> 34:22.789
I think these are yours.

34:22.813 --> 34:23.989
Oh, thanks.

34:24.014 --> 34:25.583
You have anything to say for yourself?

34:25.650 --> 34:26.867
What?

34:27.554 --> 34:30.947
Anthony, you had her get
your favorite chocolates.

34:30.973 --> 34:32.714
Well, you weren't gonna eat them anyway.

34:32.739 --> 34:34.393
You're such a shyster.

34:34.418 --> 34:36.072
Yeah, and you're a pushover.

34:36.097 --> 34:38.099
Don't tell anyone.

34:38.123 --> 34:40.081
Pretty good... you want one?

34:40.107 --> 34:41.543
No.

34:42.987 --> 34:44.674
So I forgave her.

34:44.699 --> 34:45.657
Mm.

34:46.056 --> 34:47.494
Just like that?

34:47.518 --> 34:49.614
No, not just like that.

34:49.639 --> 34:53.382
I raked her over the coals,
and then I forgave her.

34:53.407 --> 34:56.106
- Good for you.
- You got a problem with forgiveness?

34:56.413 --> 34:58.198
Only that it's overrated.

34:58.501 --> 35:01.068
Whoa, remind me not to cross him.

35:01.431 --> 35:02.629
Don't cross him.

35:02.654 --> 35:04.134
Thank you.

35:04.287 --> 35:06.911
"To err is human, to forgive, divine."

35:06.935 --> 35:08.719
And it's also important to be careful

35:08.763 --> 35:10.809
about who and what and when you forgive.

35:11.244 --> 35:13.420
I'm not saying not to forgive.

35:13.463 --> 35:16.205
It's just... most people
ask for forgiveness

35:16.249 --> 35:17.859
because they can't forgive themselves,

35:17.903 --> 35:20.340
so they go looking
for some phony affirmation

35:20.383 --> 35:22.733
that somebody knows they meant well.

35:23.673 --> 35:25.294
So what's the case?

35:25.338 --> 35:26.563
What are you talking about?

35:27.219 --> 35:30.654
What's the case that's
got you feeling so cynical?

35:33.016 --> 35:35.224
Hey, you threw this hand grenade.

35:39.576 --> 35:42.275
There was a woman who supplied bad drugs

35:42.300 --> 35:44.694
to two young girls who worked for her.

35:44.755 --> 35:47.280
They both OD'd and died and...

35:47.323 --> 35:49.325
she lied and tried to hide her actions.

35:53.721 --> 35:55.679
Well, yeah, that's pretty unforgivable.

35:55.723 --> 35:57.072
I'll give you that.

35:57.116 --> 35:58.813
But we don't have to worry
about forgiving her now,

35:58.857 --> 36:00.627
'cause she killed herself.

36:06.211 --> 36:08.127
She... couldn't forgive herself

36:08.152 --> 36:09.937
and didn't want to waste
everyone's time asking them to,

36:09.962 --> 36:12.264
so she did what she did.

36:13.872 --> 36:16.309
Funny thing is as cowardly as it is,

36:16.352 --> 36:18.354
I kind of respect her for it.

36:19.037 --> 36:20.748
Whoa, Danny.

36:20.791 --> 36:22.271
That's a hard line.

36:22.315 --> 36:24.708
I wasn't expecting to feel
this way about it, Gramps,

36:24.752 --> 36:26.232
but it is what it is.

36:27.404 --> 36:29.823
Yes, and you're forgiven for it.

36:32.369 --> 36:33.980
That's not what I was asking for, Dad.

36:34.196 --> 36:35.871
I know that.

36:44.629 --> 36:46.381
I forgive you, too, Dad.

36:50.218 --> 36:51.595
Well, thanks.

36:52.258 --> 36:54.390
Is there something you
should be forgiven for?

36:54.434 --> 36:56.433
- No, I'm good.
- You sure?

36:56.458 --> 36:57.589
Can't a guy just be nice?

36:59.352 --> 37:01.062
I suppose.

37:12.893 --> 37:15.594
Because I though the
might tell me the truth

37:15.619 --> 37:18.491
in a way that he would
not or could not with you.

37:18.830 --> 37:20.709
That's pretty presumptuous of you.

37:20.734 --> 37:22.605
Oh, come on, Kevin!

37:22.630 --> 37:25.001
The rank and file don't talk to a you

37:25.026 --> 37:27.443
or a me with total honesty.

37:27.468 --> 37:29.799
Goes with the stars,
the big hats, whatever.

37:29.948 --> 37:32.219
We're not meant to be
shoulders to cry on.

37:32.244 --> 37:34.507
Yes... but don't forget

37:34.532 --> 37:36.781
you came to me out of concern

37:36.806 --> 37:39.113
for this particular priest.

37:39.138 --> 37:40.922
Concern for his welfare.

37:40.947 --> 37:42.287
Yes, so?

37:42.312 --> 37:45.794
So... don't lose that in the confusion.

37:46.138 --> 37:49.069
I bet he's still the fine
priest you thought he was.

37:49.094 --> 37:51.112
Well, thank you for pointing that out.

37:51.795 --> 37:54.102
But I'm afraid there's no confusion.

37:54.146 --> 37:56.117
I don't have choices here.

37:58.495 --> 37:59.934
So you're moving him.

37:59.978 --> 38:01.196
Yes.

38:01.240 --> 38:02.479
Now, don't get mad...

38:02.522 --> 38:04.504
Then don't continue with the thought.

38:04.547 --> 38:07.115
Father Kennelly has a son.

38:07.159 --> 38:09.481
And he has a relationship with that son.

38:09.506 --> 38:12.291
Yes, and if he wants to
continue with that relationship

38:12.316 --> 38:14.318
in this manner,
he can leave the priesthood.

38:14.437 --> 38:16.638
You got a big surplus of good priests?

38:18.139 --> 38:20.215
You look the other way on a good cop

38:20.259 --> 38:22.160
who breaks one of your house rules?

38:22.185 --> 38:23.311
No.

38:23.657 --> 38:27.356
But I weigh it against his
value to the people we serve.

38:27.381 --> 38:28.827
And I wish I had that latitude.

38:28.851 --> 38:30.443
I really do.

38:31.444 --> 38:35.143
But unlike with you,
the buck doesn't stop here.

38:36.666 --> 38:38.326
I understand.

38:40.287 --> 38:44.022
Young priest out in White stone
this past May,

38:44.065 --> 38:46.543
I was giving him his last rites.

38:47.938 --> 38:49.546
He died too young.

38:51.290 --> 38:52.799
And he confessed.

38:53.583 --> 38:56.369
He said, "You know what
we priests talk about

38:56.394 --> 38:58.222
"when we get together?

38:58.558 --> 39:00.081
"Celibacy.

39:00.932 --> 39:04.085
"And not as in, 'aren't we blessed

39:04.129 --> 39:06.740
that we can't have families.'"

39:09.149 --> 39:11.610
But you know the deal when you sign up.

39:12.277 --> 39:14.821
It's not like it's in the fine print.

39:18.324 --> 39:19.951
You're a good friend, Frank.

39:21.059 --> 39:23.713
I'll be thanking you
with every toss and turn

39:23.738 --> 39:26.001
of my sleepless nights.

39:32.548 --> 39:34.550
May God bless you, Kevin.
