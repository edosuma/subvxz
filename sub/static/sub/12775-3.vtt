00:00.234 --> 00:01.679
I can't believe it's been a month

00:01.704 --> 00:04.365
since I left Josh and
that sick relationship.

00:04.390 --> 00:06.311
I mean, I got sucked
into such a deep hole,

00:06.336 --> 00:08.236
I lost sight of myself
and my dreams, but,

00:08.261 --> 00:11.611
boy, heh, have things
turned around for me.

00:11.636 --> 00:13.474
- Gabi Diamond is back...
- (clink)

00:13.499 --> 00:15.278
and better than ever.

00:17.930 --> 00:20.355
- (Man) Gabi! Hairnet!
- Oh, sorry! My bad!

00:22.087 --> 00:23.855
You know, one month ago, I was a mess.

00:24.215 --> 00:27.121
I was depressed. I was in a screwed
up relationship with my chef.

00:27.146 --> 00:28.739
I hit rock bottom, my friend.

00:29.194 --> 00:30.936
But Kaminski's back, baby...

00:30.961 --> 00:32.567
and better than ever.

00:33.004 --> 00:34.626
Okay...

00:34.651 --> 00:38.465
ah, we have two breakfast burritos,
two hash browns, two chips,

00:38.490 --> 00:41.410
two sides of guac, and one fork.

00:43.660 --> 00:44.894
See you at lunch.

00:46.535 --> 00:49.437

00:51.867 --> 00:53.968

01:09.652 --> 01:13.732
Yolanda, what kind of birthday cake
do you want for your party again?

01:13.757 --> 01:17.408
It's really hard to keep
track of all the cakes you eat.

01:17.661 --> 01:20.020
It's the Peanut Butter
Dream from Jan's Cake House.

01:20.045 --> 01:21.201
I mean, you should know it.

01:21.226 --> 01:24.013
It's right next to that store that
sells dress clothes for toddlers.

01:26.727 --> 01:28.595
Okay, here's the address.

01:28.620 --> 01:30.421
And just so I know you went,

01:30.446 --> 01:32.047
bring me back a cupcake.

01:33.121 --> 01:34.722
(sighs) Now, I have a problem.

01:35.084 --> 01:37.632
In addition to drinking,
gambling, and overeating?

01:39.740 --> 01:41.034
I have to send out the e-vites,

01:41.059 --> 01:43.037
and I don't know what is
going on with Josh and Gabi.

01:43.062 --> 01:45.699
Now, I thought they'd be
talking by now, but they're not.

01:45.725 --> 01:47.004
Isn't it great?

01:48.291 --> 01:50.700
No! Obviously I have to invite Josh.

01:50.725 --> 01:53.875
I mean, he's my boss and
he's hostin' and payin'.

01:54.333 --> 01:56.294
But I don't know what to do about Gabi.

01:56.432 --> 01:59.431
If you don't invite her,
she'll be really hurt.

01:59.456 --> 02:01.390
- Yeah.
- Can I tell her?

02:02.549 --> 02:04.627
I want all the people
I love to be there.

02:04.652 --> 02:06.884
Even my daughter's trying to
get leave from the military.

02:06.909 --> 02:09.580
I mean, how many times
am I going to turn 50?

02:09.604 --> 02:11.691
Once, and that was ten years ago.

02:12.841 --> 02:14.243
What are you guys talking about?

02:14.434 --> 02:16.941
Yolanda was gonna send out
the e-vites for her 50th,

02:16.966 --> 02:18.765
and because you and Gabi aren't talking,

02:18.790 --> 02:20.324
she's not gonna invite her.

02:20.452 --> 02:22.186
Yay!

02:22.211 --> 02:23.979
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:24.004 --> 02:25.896
Of course you're inviting her, Yolanda.

02:25.921 --> 02:27.155
It's your big day.

02:28.235 --> 02:29.998
So, you don't have a problem seeing her?

02:30.499 --> 02:31.796
And her seeing you?

02:33.262 --> 02:35.789
Oh, yeah, I get it.

02:36.097 --> 02:39.226
Might be a little uncomfortable for her
to see how great I'm doing without her.

02:39.251 --> 02:41.790
But don't worry, not gonna rub it in.

02:41.967 --> 02:43.590
I'll be the bigger person.

02:45.207 --> 02:46.832
Yes, you are.

02:48.044 --> 02:50.428
I'm gonna go send those
invites out right now!

02:53.004 --> 02:55.953
Well, I really admire your confidence.

02:55.978 --> 02:57.910
Are you sure you're gonna
be able to handle this?

02:58.111 --> 02:59.486
Handle what?

03:00.172 --> 03:02.990
Gabi seeing this!

03:03.930 --> 03:05.198
What are you doing?

03:05.786 --> 03:07.818
You're fat, Josh. You're fat.

03:07.987 --> 03:09.243
I'm not gonna glaze over it,

03:09.268 --> 03:11.405
even though I know you
love anything glazed,

03:11.430 --> 03:12.675
'cause you're fat!

03:12.700 --> 03:14.192
Need I remind you that
when we were in Hawaii,

03:14.217 --> 03:15.883
you said I had a body built for Speedos?

03:15.908 --> 03:17.930
Well, now it's built from Fritos.

03:18.247 --> 03:21.403
I have not gained any weight since then.

03:21.428 --> 03:25.122
Good. Well, I just picked up the
suit you wore to the Dingo Awards.

03:25.147 --> 03:26.347
Why don't you try it on?

03:26.372 --> 03:28.273
Okay, I will, and it's
gonna fit beautifully.

03:28.802 --> 03:30.982
I'm gonna show you, I
have not gained any weight.

03:31.393 --> 03:32.593
Show me.

03:35.642 --> 03:37.070
Oh, my God, I'm fat!

03:37.095 --> 03:38.859
Elliot, I cannot let
Gabi see me like this.

03:38.884 --> 03:41.336
- Yolanda! Don't send out the...
- (phone chimes)

03:42.156 --> 03:43.356
invites.

03:49.995 --> 03:51.195
Hi!

03:51.458 --> 03:53.896
Hey! Sofia, great news!

03:53.921 --> 03:56.857
I got bumped up from
prep cook to fry cook.

03:56.882 --> 03:59.808
- Ooh! That's amazing.
- Mm-hmm.

03:59.833 --> 04:01.633
What's the difference?

04:02.002 --> 04:05.752
Seventy cents an hour. No more
minimum wage for this girl.

04:05.982 --> 04:08.417
Life is going pretty great for Gabi.

04:08.662 --> 04:12.318
Well, I am very happy you're happy
because we just got an invitation

04:12.343 --> 04:14.072
to Yolanda's 50th birthday...

04:14.097 --> 04:15.316
at Josh's.

04:15.341 --> 04:17.726
What? I can't see Josh!
I'm a freakin' fry cook!

04:17.752 --> 04:19.151
(phone rings)

04:20.139 --> 04:22.101
Oh, my God, it's him. He's
calling. What do I say?

04:22.125 --> 04:23.571
- What if he asks what I'm doing?
- Don't answer it.

04:23.596 --> 04:24.848
Fine! I'll answer it!

04:26.422 --> 04:27.685
Hello.

04:27.710 --> 04:28.944
Hey!

04:28.969 --> 04:31.471
Gabi, it's Josh, your former boss.

04:31.748 --> 04:33.168
And other stuff.

04:34.941 --> 04:37.420
Oh. Hi, Josh. It's, uh, me, Gabi,

04:37.445 --> 04:40.481
which... you know 'cause you called me.

04:40.506 --> 04:42.938
So did you get the invite
to Yolanda's birthday?

04:42.963 --> 04:44.291
I did.

04:44.316 --> 04:47.563
So... are you coming? Not coming?

04:47.588 --> 04:50.023
Look, I... If not, I
totally get it. I mean...

04:50.048 --> 04:51.661
might be a little embarrassing.

04:51.686 --> 04:53.518
Embarrassing? Why
would I be embarrassed?

04:53.543 --> 04:55.043
Well, you know...

04:55.068 --> 04:56.980
coming back to the place
where you used to work...

04:57.005 --> 04:58.292
when you're not working.

04:58.519 --> 05:01.683
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who told you
I'm not working? I'm working.

05:01.708 --> 05:03.525
I have a great job and I love it.

05:03.550 --> 05:05.685
Oh. Really?

05:07.449 --> 05:08.749
Doin' what?

05:09.648 --> 05:11.288
Wh... (gasps)

05:11.461 --> 05:12.661
Giada!

05:14.289 --> 05:16.428
Giada De Laurentiis!

05:17.132 --> 05:19.138
Is who I'm working for.

05:20.015 --> 05:21.662
The delicious Italian food maker?

05:21.696 --> 05:23.498
Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. That's the one.

05:23.523 --> 05:26.399
Best-selling cookbooks,
Emmys, her own product line.

05:26.735 --> 05:28.558
She may even be richer than you.

05:28.583 --> 05:31.277
(chuckles) You don't...
I doubt it. (chuckles)

05:31.302 --> 05:34.112
So wait, where, um,
where did we leave things?

05:34.137 --> 05:35.744
Are you... you comin'?
You're not coming?

05:35.769 --> 05:37.043
You're too uncomfortable to come?

05:37.069 --> 05:39.659
Why would I be uncomfortable?
I'm working for Giada.

05:39.684 --> 05:42.072
Sounds like you're the one who
may have a problem with me coming.

05:42.097 --> 05:45.267
Problem? What? I don't have a problem!

05:45.292 --> 05:47.932
Whole reason for me to...
call you is to get you to come.

05:47.957 --> 05:49.525
Great. I'm coming.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.057
Great. Good. See you there.

05:51.425 --> 05:52.754
Son-of-a-bitch, she's coming.

05:53.308 --> 05:54.809
Hey! Hey!

05:55.140 --> 05:56.376
Where's Giada? Where's Giada?

05:56.401 --> 05:58.513
- Where's Giada?
- Oh, my God, Gabi,

05:58.538 --> 06:00.531
I asked her to say "Spi-geh-tee,"

06:00.556 --> 06:02.616
and she said, "Spi-geh-tee."

06:03.343 --> 06:04.589
Where is she?

06:04.615 --> 06:06.448
She just came to get a coffee and left.

06:06.473 --> 06:08.486
Why are you freaking out... Oh.

06:08.584 --> 06:10.002
Let me guess.

06:10.028 --> 06:13.800
You told Josh that you were working
with Giada because you were embarrassed,

06:13.825 --> 06:15.821
and now you need her to give you a job?

06:16.691 --> 06:18.525
No.

06:18.887 --> 06:20.255
Yes.

06:24.259 --> 06:27.390
Gabi? Hey, I just got your
text. What's the emergency?

06:27.415 --> 06:29.365
Ta-dah! Check it out.

06:29.390 --> 06:32.018
Thick slices of ham covered
in melted provolone cheese

06:32.043 --> 06:33.523
topped with a vinaigrette slaw

06:33.548 --> 06:36.634
and a saffron aioli dipped
in egg batter and deep fried.

06:36.659 --> 06:38.086
Meet The Giada.

06:39.694 --> 06:40.894
(vocalizes)

06:42.906 --> 06:45.318
Oh, my God, Gabi. This is amazing.

06:45.343 --> 06:47.042
Mm-hmm. Thanks!

06:47.067 --> 06:49.406
So I found out Giada is
shooting a special here in town,

06:49.431 --> 06:51.106
so all I gotta do is find her,

06:51.131 --> 06:53.161
give her The Giada,
and get her to hire me,

06:53.186 --> 06:55.287
and then by the time I see Josh,

06:55.312 --> 06:58.162
the only thing I'll be
full of is "spi-geh-tee."

07:00.132 --> 07:01.332
You know what, Gabi?

07:01.625 --> 07:03.362
As crazy as that plan sounds,

07:03.387 --> 07:05.409
if Giada tastes this sandwich...

07:06.569 --> 07:08.512
she will definitely give you a job.

07:08.749 --> 07:10.316
Right?

07:10.341 --> 07:12.636
I mean, how lucky am I
that I was talking to Josh

07:12.661 --> 07:14.255
right when Giada walked in?

07:14.280 --> 07:16.719
Can you imagine if he found
out that I was a fry cook?

07:17.938 --> 07:19.139
(sighs)

07:19.164 --> 07:22.562
I guess sometimes you're just in
the right place at the right time.

07:27.260 --> 07:30.178
Oh, my God, Gabi's working at a diner.

07:30.203 --> 07:37.308
(laughs)

07:41.517 --> 07:43.499
You are not gonna
believe what happened...

07:44.310 --> 07:46.596
You found Giada and gave her The Giada.

07:47.587 --> 07:49.021
Can I tell the story?

07:50.878 --> 07:53.019
So I found out where Giada was
shooting her special, right?

07:53.044 --> 07:54.504
And so, I followed the
crew back to the hotel,

07:54.529 --> 07:55.787
and when we were in
the elevator, I said,

07:55.812 --> 07:58.265
"How cool is it that we're all
staying on the same floor as Giada?"

07:58.290 --> 08:00.024
and they said, "No,
we're on the fourth floor.

08:00.049 --> 08:01.405
Giada's on the top floor in a suite,"

08:01.430 --> 08:03.772
and I said, "Well, I
guess she likes me better."

08:03.797 --> 08:06.170
- (laughs)
- So, I went up to the top floor

08:06.195 --> 08:08.051
and I knocked on the presidential
suite, and she answered.

08:08.076 --> 08:09.685
She answered her own door, Sofia.

08:10.257 --> 08:12.598
So, I told her that I
made her something so good

08:12.623 --> 08:14.751
that when she tastes it,
she's gonna have to hire me,

08:14.776 --> 08:16.396
and she said, "How did
you get my room number?"

08:16.421 --> 08:18.049
and I said, "Eat my sandwich, Giada!"

08:19.770 --> 08:21.170
And that's when security came

08:21.195 --> 08:22.651
and escorted me off the property.

08:24.017 --> 08:25.806
Somehow I think there's more.

08:25.841 --> 08:28.043
So, I went downstairs and
I found Giada's driver,

08:28.068 --> 08:30.069
and I gave him the
sandwich to give to her,

08:30.094 --> 08:31.883
and he started eating
it, so I yelled at him,

08:31.908 --> 08:34.179
and that's when Giada came
down and she gave me this.

08:35.131 --> 08:36.438
Her autograph?

08:36.462 --> 08:38.799
Yes, on the bottom of
this restraining order.

08:41.409 --> 08:42.688
Okay.

08:42.712 --> 08:45.139
So, um, just to be clear,

08:45.164 --> 08:46.832
you're not working for Giada?

08:47.848 --> 08:49.761
- Correct.
- Ugh.

08:49.786 --> 08:52.863
And I can't go to Yolanda's
birthday party. I can't face Josh.

08:54.379 --> 08:55.980
Hey, girls.

08:56.014 --> 08:57.448
Hey, Yolanda.

08:57.482 --> 08:58.683
(sighs)

08:58.708 --> 09:01.290
I just found out my daughter's
not gonna make my party.

09:01.315 --> 09:03.316
I mean, it's hard enough
turning the big five-oh,

09:03.341 --> 09:05.408
but now none of my
kids are gonna be there.

09:05.691 --> 09:07.173
Yeah. Listen, Yolanda,

09:07.198 --> 09:08.949
- I'm really sorry, but I don't think...
- Oh well.

09:08.974 --> 09:10.941
The only thing that's
gonna make it better is...

09:10.966 --> 09:12.639
you're gonna be there.

09:12.664 --> 09:16.264
I always thought of you girls
as my daughters. (chuckles)

09:16.289 --> 09:19.067
Of course, my real daughter is
overseas fighting for your freedom.

09:20.569 --> 09:22.504
So, that makes her a little better.

09:22.529 --> 09:23.960
(laughs)

09:23.985 --> 09:26.897
Oh, but I love you two! Oh!

09:26.922 --> 09:29.073
I'm so glad you both gonna be there.

09:29.107 --> 09:30.549
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

09:30.574 --> 09:32.041
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

09:35.056 --> 09:36.976
A fry cook at a diner?

09:37.001 --> 09:39.557
Wow. I can't believe she lied
to me just to make it seem

09:39.582 --> 09:41.716
like she was doing so great without me.

09:41.741 --> 09:43.480
How pathetic.

09:44.666 --> 09:45.966
Now pull!

09:47.040 --> 09:48.874
(exhales)

09:48.909 --> 09:51.054
You know, I can't believe I
spent all that time working out

09:51.079 --> 09:52.627
when all I needed was this man corset.

09:54.011 --> 09:56.245
- Ready for the final pull?
- Yeah.

09:56.449 --> 09:59.084
Pull it really tight. I want
to make sure I look gooood!

10:00.216 --> 10:01.424
(breathing heavily)

10:01.449 --> 10:03.183
So, do I look good?

10:03.415 --> 10:05.079
Like, really good?

10:05.104 --> 10:07.706
I mean, it's been, like, a
month since I've seen Josh.

10:07.860 --> 10:09.518
You look amazing.

10:09.543 --> 10:11.944
But, uh, what... what is that smell?

10:11.969 --> 10:14.071
(whispers) Oh. It's garlic.

10:15.052 --> 10:17.870
I put a little behind my ears to
sell that I'm working for Giada.

10:18.687 --> 10:20.485
Gabi, I know you really
want to impress Josh,

10:20.510 --> 10:23.115
but just be careful not to get
too carried away with this lie

10:23.140 --> 10:25.809
because sometimes they
have a way of unraveling.

10:25.834 --> 10:27.935
Don't worry, I have a whole plan.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.750
After I'm done rubbing my happiness

10:29.776 --> 10:33.607
in Josh's face, I'm gonna
flip my hair like this...

10:35.290 --> 10:37.884
and that'll be your signal
to call me so I can pretend

10:37.909 --> 10:40.478
it's Giada needing me for
something really important,

10:40.627 --> 10:43.384
and then I can exit gracefully...

10:43.409 --> 10:44.291
(elevator dings)

10:44.316 --> 10:46.078
...like a winner in life.

10:47.811 --> 10:51.503
Josh, I can't thank you enough
for hosting this party for me.

10:51.528 --> 10:53.762
This is the best birthday ever.

10:54.381 --> 10:55.848
Anything for you, Yolanda.

10:55.873 --> 10:57.090
- You know there's nothing more
- (door opens)

10:57.115 --> 10:58.315
important than...

10:58.591 --> 10:59.791
Gabi!

11:00.412 --> 11:01.710
She's here.

11:01.735 --> 11:04.403
Oh, I can't wait to see the
look on her face when I bust her.

11:04.428 --> 11:06.711
(squeals) Oh, hey, girls!

11:06.736 --> 11:08.959
- Welcome to my par-tay.
- (Gabi) Aww.

11:08.984 --> 11:10.864
(Both) Happy birthday, Yolanda!

11:11.082 --> 11:14.730
Oh, my God, mini lasagnas?
Is it my birthday?

11:15.578 --> 11:17.834
I'm so glad you made it, Gabi.

11:17.859 --> 11:19.663
Yeah, I wouldn't miss it for the world.

11:19.688 --> 11:21.772
You know, there's nothing
more important to me than...

11:21.797 --> 11:22.997
Josh.

11:25.525 --> 11:27.510
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:27.535 --> 11:29.156
(chuckles nervously)

11:29.181 --> 11:30.974
- Well, give me a hug. Okay.
- All right.

11:30.999 --> 11:32.199
(groans)

11:32.835 --> 11:34.035
Wow.

11:34.586 --> 11:35.786
Hard bod.

11:35.811 --> 11:39.109
Yeah, you know, just lots of hard
work, diet, and exercise. Nothing else.

11:40.334 --> 11:41.534
Enough about me.

11:41.559 --> 11:43.623
Tell me about this
amazing job with Giada.

11:43.739 --> 11:44.978
I can't really talk about it.

11:45.003 --> 11:46.900
We have a lot of secret
projects in the works.

11:46.925 --> 11:48.926
We're writing a book
together. Can't say any more!

11:49.732 --> 11:51.842
We're opening a restaurant
together. Possibly a chain.

11:51.867 --> 11:53.865
Oh, did that just
slip out? Zip! (laughs)

11:53.890 --> 11:56.163
Wow. That sounds unreal.

11:56.188 --> 11:58.110
What's the concept of
this new restaurant?

11:58.592 --> 12:01.777
Um, you know, Giada and I haven't
really worked out all the details yet.

12:01.802 --> 12:03.568
Mm. Where's it located?

12:03.593 --> 12:05.353
Wait, you're not gonna
have to move, are you?

12:06.057 --> 12:09.154
These are all very good questions,

12:09.179 --> 12:11.022
and I have answers

12:11.500 --> 12:13.665
to all of these very good...

12:13.690 --> 12:15.238
questions.

12:15.862 --> 12:17.148
(phone rings)

12:17.173 --> 12:19.060
Oh, no. Ooh, someone's calling.

12:19.084 --> 12:22.172
Oh, dear, this looks very important.
I'm gonna have to take this.

12:22.259 --> 12:25.077
Hi, Giada. What's, uh,
shakin' with you, G?

12:26.098 --> 12:29.342
Sorry, Josh. It's Giada,
so I really gotta...

12:29.367 --> 12:30.567
talk to her.

12:31.464 --> 12:33.401
Wouldn't it be easier to just...

12:33.741 --> 12:35.108
talk to her in person?

12:39.179 --> 12:41.856
Gabi, Giada's here.

12:43.084 --> 12:44.284
Oh, my God.

12:44.423 --> 12:46.675
Wow, this is all...

12:46.700 --> 12:48.406
such a surprise.

12:48.431 --> 12:50.474
- (Gabi chuckles)
- Isn't it, Gabi?

12:50.891 --> 12:54.148
- Um, Giada... listen...
- No, no, no. Back away.

12:54.173 --> 12:56.765
The restraining order says, you
can't be within 100 feet of me.

12:56.790 --> 12:59.946
Oh! Giada, you're just so funny.

12:59.971 --> 13:01.441
- Come here, you!
- Stop, stop.

13:01.466 --> 13:03.801
I have pepper spray and
I'm not afraid to use it.

13:05.531 --> 13:06.735
(sighs)

13:06.760 --> 13:08.731
Listen, I'm sorry. She's a nut-job.

13:08.756 --> 13:10.433
Send the check directly to my charity.

13:10.673 --> 13:13.095
Wait, you promised!

13:13.352 --> 13:16.977
- Fine. Spi-geh-tee.
- (gasps) Yay!

13:20.944 --> 13:22.144
Gotcha.

13:23.052 --> 13:25.648
- What?
- Oh, Gabi, Gabi, Gabi.

13:26.078 --> 13:28.385
You tried so hard to make it look like

13:28.409 --> 13:30.405
you were doing so great without me

13:30.430 --> 13:32.731
when I know you work at a diner. Yeah.

13:32.756 --> 13:35.001
Elliott saw you when he was
going to get Yolanda's cake.

13:35.026 --> 13:36.426
Sorry.

13:37.044 --> 13:38.644
Okay, but I only...

13:38.952 --> 13:41.461
Wait a minute. You knew?

13:41.642 --> 13:44.855
So, this whole thing was
just a setup to humiliate me?

13:44.880 --> 13:46.411
No, no, no, no, no. You're
not turning this around on me.

13:46.436 --> 13:48.420
Oh, it's turning all by itself.

13:48.445 --> 13:51.201
I may have lied, but it
was only a desperate attempt

13:51.226 --> 13:53.243
to make myself not look
pathetic in front of you.

13:53.268 --> 13:55.730
But you knew I was pathetic,

13:55.755 --> 13:59.137
and so you did a mean thing
to make me look pathetic-er!

13:59.588 --> 14:01.422
(clinking)

14:02.079 --> 14:03.884
Attention, y'all!

14:04.397 --> 14:06.687
Why don't we all shut our mouth

14:07.389 --> 14:10.897
and go out on the terrace and
have some cake and open some gifts?

14:10.922 --> 14:12.623
(chuckles) Do somethin'.

14:13.472 --> 14:15.906
Guys, Yolanda's really
upset. Just keep it down.

14:16.119 --> 14:17.972
- Yeah, keep it down, Josh.
- You keep it down.

14:17.997 --> 14:19.746
- You keep it down. You!
- You keep it down.

14:22.426 --> 14:24.948
Ooh! This is from my daughter Vanessa...

14:25.371 --> 14:27.330
who sadly couldn't be here tonight.

14:27.364 --> 14:30.964
(gasps) My goodness, this is beautiful!

14:31.368 --> 14:34.516
You know what? I may not be working
my dream job, but at least I'm working.

14:34.541 --> 14:35.852
And my life is better without you.

14:35.876 --> 14:37.778
Oh, please. Your whole life is a lie.

14:40.410 --> 14:42.277
(corset unraveling)

14:42.302 --> 14:43.672
- Uh-oh.
- (snap)

14:44.632 --> 14:46.069
No, no, no, no, no! No!

14:48.169 --> 14:49.854
- What the hell?
- Right?

14:50.106 --> 14:51.775
He's gigantic!

14:52.104 --> 14:55.140
Who's the big, bad liar now?

14:58.777 --> 15:02.214
Hm. You are so lucky that necklace
landed in that ficus tree down there.

15:02.239 --> 15:05.265
Yeah, well, he's the lucky one. It was
his fatness that caused all of this.

15:06.652 --> 15:08.938
All right, I'm gonna run downstairs
and see if the Walshs are home.

15:08.963 --> 15:11.703
Get real, Josh. You haven't
run anywhere in weeks.

15:16.230 --> 15:18.616
- (clang)
- What the hell is that?

15:18.641 --> 15:19.904
An emergency rope ladder.

15:19.929 --> 15:22.329
Someone's goin' down this damn
thing and getting my necklace.

15:22.570 --> 15:24.793
"Maximum weight limit: 200 pounds."

15:24.818 --> 15:26.018
- You're out.
- You're out.

15:26.043 --> 15:27.711
Okay, fine.

15:28.231 --> 15:29.464
Sofia will do it.

15:29.489 --> 15:33.168
What? No! No way! I'm the only
one who didn't do anything wrong!

15:33.810 --> 15:35.143
All right, fine.

15:35.568 --> 15:37.921
I'm a fry cook at a diner.
What do I have to live for?

15:37.946 --> 15:39.146
(gasps) Oh...

15:39.573 --> 15:40.962
Gabi, wait.

15:41.200 --> 15:43.001
This might be dangerous.

15:43.026 --> 15:44.593
Let me find my camera.

15:46.729 --> 15:48.396
(whimpers)

15:48.421 --> 15:50.466
(breathing heavily)

15:50.491 --> 15:51.892
No one answered the door.

15:51.917 --> 15:54.066
Gabi, what are you
doing? Get back up here.

15:54.091 --> 15:55.966
No. I'm getting Yolanda's necklace.

15:55.991 --> 15:57.233
Well, then I'm helping you.

15:57.258 --> 15:58.458
No, you're not.

15:58.483 --> 16:01.118
Elliot, I climbed Mount Kilimanjaro.

16:01.143 --> 16:03.185
Now you are Mount Kilimanjaro!

16:03.885 --> 16:06.149
Okay, I'm really close!
I just can't get there!

16:06.809 --> 16:09.289
Same thing happened to me
with my date last night!

16:10.584 --> 16:11.951
Just trying to lighten the mood.

16:12.960 --> 16:15.160
There! Use these!

16:15.752 --> 16:16.952
(grunts)

16:18.959 --> 16:21.067
(grunts) Okay, I got it! Aah!

16:21.092 --> 16:23.157
- Oh, thank God.
- Now get back up here.

16:23.182 --> 16:24.605
Stop yelling at me!

16:24.631 --> 16:26.651
If you hadn't eaten all your feelings,

16:26.816 --> 16:30.209
you would be the one on the ladder
trying to save Yolanda's birthday.

16:30.234 --> 16:32.101
Huh! Well, if you wouldn't have lied,

16:32.126 --> 16:33.833
no one would be on the
ladder in the first place.

16:33.858 --> 16:35.091
This is not my fault!

16:35.116 --> 16:36.549
This is your fault!

16:36.574 --> 16:37.774
(screams)

16:42.506 --> 16:44.707
Okay, that last part
was kind of my fault!

16:48.454 --> 16:51.620
Oh, Yolanda, I'm really sorry
we didn't find your necklace.

16:52.105 --> 16:54.816
But look on the bright
side, now we both hate Gabi.

16:55.861 --> 16:58.526
Well, we could've kept looking
if Josh didn't have to come back

16:58.551 --> 17:00.264
because his thighs were chaffing.

17:02.968 --> 17:05.500
No. I stopped looking
'cause I couldn't take

17:05.525 --> 17:07.548
your whining about the
outfit you have to return

17:07.573 --> 17:09.491
since you don't actually work for Giada.

17:10.417 --> 17:11.964
Well, at least all my new clothes

17:11.990 --> 17:13.718
are the same size as my old ones.

17:13.742 --> 17:15.425
Really? You want to go there?

17:15.450 --> 17:17.526
Yeah! Oh, you think I'm not
afraid to go there? I'll go there!

17:17.550 --> 17:19.113
-  Go there! Just call me fat!
- I'll go there.

17:19.137 --> 17:20.496
- (Josh) Oh, my God!
- Stop!

17:21.912 --> 17:25.441
You didn't hire Giada to cook for my
party because she was my favorite chef.

17:25.465 --> 17:28.163
You did it because you
wanted to catch Gabi in a lie.

17:28.716 --> 17:30.913
And wipe the smirk off your face!

17:30.938 --> 17:32.642
You didn't care about my party either!

17:32.666 --> 17:35.403
You just wanted Josh to think
you were doing great without him!

17:35.855 --> 17:37.087
- (whimpers)
- You know,

17:37.112 --> 17:38.385
I almost didn't have this party

17:38.410 --> 17:41.043
because I was so worried
about your feelings.

17:41.068 --> 17:43.122
Well, obviously neither
one of you cared about mine!

17:43.147 --> 17:44.663
You're so damn selfish!

17:45.335 --> 17:47.700
Yeah! That's my thing!

17:49.000 --> 17:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

17:56.764 --> 17:58.543
This your idea of cheering me up?

17:58.568 --> 18:01.668
Taking me to a crappy diner
on the wrong side of town?

18:02.516 --> 18:04.114
You live around the block.

18:04.139 --> 18:05.506
Exactly.

18:06.070 --> 18:07.763
(Both) Surprise!

18:07.788 --> 18:09.950
Wait! Is this an intervention?

18:10.802 --> 18:12.469
This just fell in my purse!

18:14.014 --> 18:15.830
No. Yolanda.

18:16.184 --> 18:18.109
We just wanted to say we're sorry.

18:18.306 --> 18:20.999
Yeah, everything you said about
us at the apartment was true.

18:21.024 --> 18:22.440
We are selfish.

18:22.556 --> 18:25.015
And we wanted to do something
very special to make it up to you.

18:25.040 --> 18:27.027
Well, I don't know how
you're gonna do that.

18:27.052 --> 18:28.848
That necklace was one of a kind.

18:29.119 --> 18:31.187
That's why we got you
something a little better.

18:33.070 --> 18:34.329
Hi, Mama.

18:36.044 --> 18:37.445
Vanessa!

18:37.470 --> 18:40.185
- Hi, Mom.
- Oh, my God, she's really here!

18:40.210 --> 18:43.117
(both chuckle)

18:43.741 --> 18:45.408
Thank you!

18:46.915 --> 18:49.456
- Happy 54th birthday, Mom!
- Shh!

18:54.648 --> 18:56.782
I think she might forgive us.

18:56.807 --> 18:58.627
Yeah, I think so.

18:58.795 --> 19:00.951
You know, I don't mean
to pat myself on the back,

19:00.976 --> 19:03.224
but it was a pretty good
idea bringing Vanessa home.

19:03.249 --> 19:05.288
You're right, Gabi. I'm the
one with the connections,

19:05.313 --> 19:07.656
the money, and the private
jet, but great idea.

19:09.103 --> 19:10.875
- We did it together.
- Yeah.

19:10.900 --> 19:12.290
It kind of felt like
we were friends again.

19:12.315 --> 19:13.515
It kind of did.

19:14.540 --> 19:17.203
And friends don't let
friends wear hairnets.

19:19.036 --> 19:20.837
What do you say you come
back and work for me?

19:21.681 --> 19:24.332
Josh, I would love that...

19:24.357 --> 19:26.629
- Great!
- But I can't.

19:27.829 --> 19:30.471
'Cause you're... still attracted to me?

19:31.324 --> 19:34.888
See, that's funny, but it kind of
makes me want to punch you in the face,

19:35.108 --> 19:37.827
which is the reason
I can't come back yet.

19:37.852 --> 19:39.451
It's too soon.

19:39.926 --> 19:42.313
Right. I totally get it.

19:42.590 --> 19:44.734
(clicks tongue)

19:44.932 --> 19:46.166
How about now?

19:47.411 --> 19:48.611
(chuckles)

19:48.782 --> 19:52.519
Okay, so about this whole us
being friends again thing...

19:53.043 --> 19:55.278
Can we be friends with Benedicts?

19:56.768 --> 19:58.802
I'm sorry, I just... I
really miss your cooking.

19:59.095 --> 20:01.518
Well, I am here 8:00-6:00.

20:01.815 --> 20:03.015
Good to know.

20:03.040 --> 20:04.240
You get here at 8:00?

20:07.704 --> 20:09.453
All right, one double cheeseburger,

20:09.478 --> 20:13.205
chicken tenders and fries,
and a diet root beer.

20:14.191 --> 20:15.391
Baby steps.

20:16.182 --> 20:17.042
(bell dings)

20:17.067 --> 20:19.384
(Man) Another Giada
sandwich ready for pick up!

20:23.806 --> 20:25.807
Hi! Excuse me.

20:25.894 --> 20:29.477
Hi, I'm Giada, and I hear you
created a sandwich named after me,

20:29.502 --> 20:32.504
and all my Twitter followers
say I have to try it.

20:32.892 --> 20:35.927
(gasps) Oh, my God. Giada.

20:36.721 --> 20:38.354
I have your sandwich.

20:38.718 --> 20:40.552
Not again!

20:41.383 --> 20:43.581
Listen, I warned you the last time!

20:43.606 --> 20:44.806
(screams)

20:44.831 --> 20:48.414
