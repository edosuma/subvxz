01:15.500 --> 01:20.289
New york... one of the biggest cities
in the world

01:21.064 --> 01:22.592
Business capital of the world.

01:23.741 --> 01:26.372
Every breath of the city...every
heartbeat is filled with speed

01:33.511 --> 01:35.455
People are always in a hurry here...

01:36.292 --> 01:39.173
in a hurry to leave home...in a hurry
to reach the office...

01:39.874 --> 01:42.233
always in a hurry to be a
step or two ahead of life

01:43.142 --> 01:45.537
There is no place for anyone
who can't cope here

01:49.401 --> 01:52.839
Miles away from lndia, this city
is infested with lndians

01:53.817 --> 01:56.662
ln fact they say every fourth face
in New y ork is an lndian

01:57.259 --> 01:57.875
One more thing...

01:58.476 --> 02:00.657
Oh... by the way that's me!

03:01.758 --> 03:04.224
This city taught me
to be independent...

03:04.853 --> 03:06.904
it taught me to fulfill my responsibilities...

03:07.287 --> 03:08.983
taught me to face life...

03:10.034 --> 03:11.421
...but it couldn't teach me to love...

03:12.781 --> 03:13.468
where was the time?

03:14.624 --> 03:16.212
Whenever l watched the
city from far...

03:17.128 --> 03:18.751
I feIt Papa Was cIoser

03:21.509 --> 03:24.424
Whenever l missed him,

03:28.741 --> 03:34.087

03:49.673 --> 03:51.818
I knoW the restaurant

03:52.106 --> 03:54.915
But there's competition
around, Mr. Shah...

03:55.305 --> 03:58.707
My mother, Jennifer.
After Papa passed away...

03:59.095 --> 04:01.241
the entire responsibility
of the family fell on her

04:01.842 --> 04:05.315
But she never allowed us to ever
feel the burden of her sorrows

04:06.258 --> 04:09.518
Thank you...I.
- I'm home.

04:11.508 --> 04:12.516
Where Were you?

04:13.873 --> 04:14.808
CentraI Park

04:15.402 --> 04:16.374
CentraI Park? Why?

04:16.689 --> 04:18.632
To meet someone.
- Who?

04:18.880 --> 04:19.673
To meet my boyfriend...

04:20.444 --> 04:24.048
BiII...biIIs...biIIs Private & confidentiaI.

04:24.338 --> 04:25.061
That's mine.

04:25.625 --> 04:27.427
What is this?
It's SWeetu's maiI again

04:27.711 --> 04:29.513

04:32.579 --> 04:33.266
Were you crying?

04:33.692 --> 04:35.185
No... you Were crying...

04:35.848 --> 04:36.571
No mom.

04:36.821 --> 04:40.402
My mother and l...
We lied to each other everyday

04:40.785 --> 04:41.793
KunWari kudi

04:42.976 --> 04:45.086
KunWari kudi marriage bureau,
What's this?

04:54.206 --> 04:55.865
MomI Where's she?

04:56.466 --> 04:57.438

04:59.179 --> 05:00.732
Hi Guys, 10 seconds to go.

05:03.386 --> 05:05.437
8 seconds to go.

05:06.133 --> 05:09.251
4,3,2,1 ....bang.

05:09.853 --> 05:12.425
My grandmother Lajjo...
She had three dreams

05:12.878 --> 05:15.202
One that New y ork
becomes a part of Punjab

05:15.521 --> 05:19.587
Two, that l marry a Sardar
and three... that my mother dies

05:20.076 --> 05:24.415
SarasWatiji, Lata, Asha and Usha have
served you With their music for years

05:25.117 --> 05:29.871
But from today Kammo,
Vimmo and I, Lajjo...

05:37.322 --> 05:39.990
The Words are 'Pritam come hither...'

05:41.146 --> 05:44.300
The song is speciaIIy requested by
our neighbour, Chaddaji from Queens...

05:46.049 --> 05:47.057

06:05.278 --> 06:09.273
''My sad heart caIIs out to you...''

06:09.554 --> 06:15.708
''Pritam, come hither...
Come hither... Come hither...''

06:15.952 --> 06:19.591
DadiI....Stop it.

06:20.020 --> 06:21.892
Oh GodI Interrupted our prayers?

06:22.142 --> 06:23.279
InsuIted the goddess?

06:23.532 --> 06:24.218
Don't you have any shame?

06:24.471 --> 06:25.538
Don't you have any shame?

06:25.792 --> 06:27.487
Singing 'Come hither'
'Come hither' to Chaddaji?

06:27.740 --> 06:30.311
Who's singing it to Chaddaji?
We are singing 'Pritam, come hither'

06:30.555 --> 06:32.630
What is his first name?

06:34.797 --> 06:35.521

06:38.239 --> 06:40.670
WoWI Pictures from KunWari KudiI

06:40.918 --> 06:43.241

06:43.490 --> 06:45.019
Three? They Iook
Iike the same guy

06:45.298 --> 06:46.163
No, no my chiId...
they are different

06:46.446 --> 06:48.354
NoW What is that KunWari kudi ad?

06:50.027 --> 06:53.121
''Hey girI, Hey GirI, hey GirI...
choose your groom and be free''

06:53.400 --> 06:54.893
''Choose one, tWo or three''

06:57.468 --> 07:00.941
Dadi, I am not interested in marrying
anyone... one tWo or three

07:01.223 --> 07:03.547
If you don't marry, my chiId,
hoW WiII you have chiIdren?

07:03.796 --> 07:06.333
I can have my chiIdren.
There's no need to marry

07:11.376 --> 07:13.664
My brother Shiv, a handicap.

07:14.019 --> 07:16.687
He couldn't play basketball
like the other boys...

07:16.974 --> 07:20.068
but he could be quite irritating
like the other boys

07:21.007 --> 07:22.430
Shiv, put off the T.V.

07:22.746 --> 07:24.204
Whenever I see,
it's aIWays basketbaIII

07:24.554 --> 07:27.091
Just because I can't pIay
doesn't mean I can't see...

07:27.753 --> 07:30.147
Don't get cute With me.
AII right. Hurry up.

07:30.395 --> 07:31.639
Gia, heIp your brother.

07:31.925 --> 07:34.983
Didi, did you see my neW doIIs?

07:35.228 --> 07:38.002

Iike Hari Putter...

07:46.634 --> 07:48.471
Harry Potter, dadi...

07:48.720 --> 07:49.479

07:49.728 --> 07:51.423
Good morning, dadi.
- Ya Ya...

07:51.744 --> 07:52.503
What's your scheduIe today?

07:52.753 --> 07:56.013
Dadi's love for Shiv was only
matched by her hatred for Gia

07:56.856 --> 08:01.894
Gia was adopted and probably that's why
Dadi did not consider her, our own

08:02.385 --> 08:06.830
And Gia... She always kept the
Dadi doll away from her perfect family

08:07.809 --> 08:09.397
Distance was not just
between the two in the family...

08:09.825 --> 08:12.705
Guru Nanak and Jesus had
their own battle in the house

08:18.761 --> 08:20.598
It's so coIdI Is the heater on?

08:20.847 --> 08:21.950

08:22.204 --> 08:23.342

08:24.359 --> 08:25.746

08:26.133 --> 08:28.183
Bet? - Don't irritate me.

08:28.463 --> 08:30.015
Chicken is just 1 doIIar.

08:30.549 --> 08:32.730
What's for breakfast?
- Fruit and cereaI

08:33.018 --> 08:34.890
What? - CereaI...

08:35.207 --> 08:37.259

08:40.702 --> 08:43.547
So What's neW?

08:43.900 --> 08:46.994
Poor daughter-in-IaW... she doesn't

08:48.178 --> 08:49.636
Our dear daughter-in-IaW, Jenny

08:51.898 --> 08:52.727
Do you knoW, Naina?

08:52.975 --> 08:55.299

08:55.584 --> 08:58.499

08:59.616 --> 09:03.090

Oh... hoW I missed ChandigarhI

09:03.372 --> 09:05.696
If you miss Chandigarh so much
then you must go aWay there

09:05.979 --> 09:06.631
What do you think Naina?

09:06.918 --> 09:12.028
I'm going noWhere. If I Ieave,
What WiII happen to these chiIdren?

09:12.899 --> 09:14.558
I'm very concerned about them

09:14.811 --> 09:17.442
And I'm concerned onIy about them

09:17.697 --> 09:19.499
Yes of course... Why WouId
you be concerned about me?

09:19.748 --> 09:22.380
Who am I to you?
If onIy my son Was aIive today...

09:22.635 --> 09:23.180

09:35.326 --> 09:40.009
Mama and Dadi's fight,
followed by my angry walkout...

09:40.785 --> 09:43.938
and then listening to my stupid
neighbour, Sweetu's stupid chatter

09:56.884 --> 09:59.029
my neighbour....

09:59.352 --> 10:02.470
She has two problems.
The weight that she never loses...

10:02.725 --> 10:04.669

never feels sad about it

10:04.916 --> 10:07.488

43:31.069 --> 43:34.401
And We're genuineIy

43:34.651 --> 43:36.488

ProbIem?- Yes... Why do you feeI...

Who are you?

43:44.213 --> 43:45.351

43:46.994 --> 43:48.653

43:48.942 --> 43:50.673
When you don't knoW hoW to vaIue

43:50.958 --> 43:53.626

43:53.914 --> 43:55.751
Not much, but enough to say..

43:56.070 --> 43:58.357
that in your eyes perhaps
you don't have much

43:58.608 --> 44:00.445

44:13.038 --> 44:15.053
Anyway, I WiII teach you to smiIe

44:22.982 --> 44:26.349

44:26.807 --> 44:28.609

WeII... anyone can do it
But I don't Want to do it...

52:58.107 --> 53:00.015
That's because you can't do it.
You're a bIoody bore.

whether they liked it or not,

01:05:57.975 --> 01:05:59.634
Everyone was being swept off their feet

01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:04.406
On Aman's insistence Dadi, Kammo
and Vimmo had given up their music...

01:06:04.929 --> 01:06:07.632
and had embraced a new passion to...

01:06:07.884 --> 01:06:13.895

Aman could do anything... anything

01:06:42.099 --> 01:06:44.873

01:07:01.257 --> 01:07:03.059
what if sorrow was
just round the corner?.

01:07:04.909 --> 01:07:05.489
What happened?

01:07:08.212 --> 01:07:10.428
Why are you sitting quiet?
Has someone died?

01:07:10.819 --> 01:07:11.684
Shut up Aman.

01:07:13.532 --> 01:07:15.084
I need some more time

01:07:15.687 --> 01:07:16.717
No... you can't get time

01:07:16.974 --> 01:07:18.218
The restaurant is going to shut...
You have to order noW

01:07:18.469 --> 01:07:19.784
I'm not taIking
about the restaurant...

01:07:22.293 --> 01:07:23.265
It's not the time to joke

01:07:23.511 --> 01:07:24.826
It's a serious probIem.

01:07:25.945 --> 01:07:27.438

01:07:40.583 --> 01:07:44.507

And as for time...

Can I do something?
- God AImightyI

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:14.509

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:40.970

on this street? Zero.

01:08:47.167 --> 01:08:48.270

01:08:48.906 --> 01:08:50.981

Bye Bye BIoody fooIs

01:08:57.877 --> 01:08:59.300
The bIoody fooIs' restaurant Works...

01:08:59.546 --> 01:09:00.412
because they have got their cuIture

01:09:00.658 --> 01:09:01.974

01:09:02.224 --> 01:09:03.089

We have a great advantage
Which We must make use of being Indians.

01:09:09.004 --> 01:09:10.319
We must get India to NeW York.

01:09:19.991 --> 01:09:23.536
Because India can do anything...
anywhere... anytime

01:09:23.817 --> 01:09:26.353
So Who are they?
- They are Chinese...

01:09:26.598 --> 01:09:28.020
Chinese, Japanese... Whatever

01:09:28.268 --> 01:09:31.326
But Aman...- No...Jenny... Try...

01:09:32.335 --> 01:09:33.828
There's no harm in trying

01:09:34.526 --> 01:09:38.343
because those Who try never Iose...
NeverI

01:09:39.046 --> 01:09:41.120

01:12:43.365 --> 01:12:43.980
Why, What?

01:12:45.451 --> 01:12:46.944
God knoWs Where you came from

01:12:48.024 --> 01:12:49.268

01:12:49.936 --> 01:12:52.260
I mean you don't even knoW us...

01:12:52.474 --> 01:12:53.897
I just don't understand Why?

01:12:54.178 --> 01:12:55.422
I did aII this for you

01:12:57.828 --> 01:12:59.737
I did aII this because of you, Naina

01:13:02.523 --> 01:13:03.838
Isn't that What you Wanted to hear?

01:13:04.609 --> 01:13:05.403
No...no...

01:13:05.652 --> 01:13:07.039
even I Was saying it
just Iike that

01:13:08.782 --> 01:13:11.840
Aman- Naina... Naina...

01:13:12.606 --> 01:13:13.222
Eyes...

01:13:15.735 --> 01:13:17.229
have you seen your mother's eyes?

01:13:18.865 --> 01:13:20.003
There's a Iot of pain in them

01:13:20.777 --> 01:13:24.001
Whatever I have done,
it's for those eyes

01:13:25.263 --> 01:13:26.199
You knoW I have a probIem

01:13:27.071 --> 01:13:30.367
I can't see any mother's
sorroW or pain

01:13:31.348 --> 01:13:35.094
Because Mothers are strange

01:13:36.459 --> 01:13:38.640
When God made them, he gave aII things

01:13:38.892 --> 01:13:40.445
that Were meant to be here... here...

01:13:40.701 --> 01:13:42.989
in their hearts... So this is Where

01:13:44.282 --> 01:13:45.420
they think from, understand and Iove

01:13:46.646 --> 01:13:47.820
And they have another probIem too

01:13:49.081 --> 01:13:50.396
They Iisten to others' conversation

01:13:50.819 --> 01:13:52.372
and start crying at the smaIIest things

01:13:52.975 --> 01:13:55.156
Mine must be crying right noW

01:14:00.137 --> 01:14:00.587

One was my heart... the other was Gia's

01:34:48.329 --> 01:34:49.953
whose Aman had turned out to be married

01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:51.907
l love you, Aman.

01:34:57.648 --> 01:35:01.050
And poor Rohit... Even Laila
had found someone

01:35:03.628 --> 01:35:08.797
But the greatest heartbreak was...

01:35:12.808 --> 01:35:14.716
He doesn't Iove me, Naina.

01:35:15.034 --> 01:35:16.171
SWeetu, don't cry. ReIax.

01:35:16.424 --> 01:35:17.147
Everything WiII be aII right

01:35:17.398 --> 01:35:23.029
He doesn't Iove me...He says he's confused

01:35:23.309 --> 01:35:23.818
SiIIy boy.

01:35:24.490 --> 01:35:25.249
I don't bIame him.

01:35:25.533 --> 01:35:26.707
HoW rude is that.

01:35:27.307 --> 01:35:30.674
He Wants to Ieave for London...
to join some bhangra group

01:35:31.237 --> 01:35:31.817
Bhangra group?

01:35:32.106 --> 01:35:34.049
Yes... and do you knoW
the name of the group?

01:35:34.296 --> 01:35:37.769
'Forget DaIer... Watch us'
What kind of a name is that?

01:35:41.250 --> 01:35:44.202
Tissue...thank you.

01:35:44.658 --> 01:35:46.673
And while we youngsters
were nursing our heartaches...

01:35:48.448 --> 01:35:50.000
the elders were finding their mates

01:35:52.446 --> 01:35:53.062
Can you believe it?

01:35:53.629 --> 01:35:57.589
Those stupid red roses
were back in my house

01:35:57.836 --> 01:35:58.630
Enough is enough.

01:35:59.435 --> 01:36:02.695
And if red roses were in the house...
the red dress was out!

01:36:03.608 --> 01:36:06.488
Hi, I'd Iike to return this
sorry, not my coIor.

01:36:07.884 --> 01:36:09.022
Not mine either.

01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:13.193
So... you didn't Iike it?

01:36:13.448 --> 01:36:15.807
No, And you?- No

01:36:17.655 --> 01:36:19.670
Nice dress. - Nice tie.

01:36:20.123 --> 01:36:22.174
Oh... What happened With Aman?

01:36:22.975 --> 01:36:26.271
What? He's married?
Why didn't you teII me earIier?

01:36:27.425 --> 01:36:28.978
If I had knoWn earIier,
WouId I faII in Iove?

01:36:31.007 --> 01:36:31.457
NoW?

01:36:32.154 --> 01:36:32.664
What noW?

01:36:34.379 --> 01:36:38.647
First I couIdn't faII in Iove...

01:36:40.916 --> 01:36:46.192
But I have to... Or eIse me
and my heart WiII feeI IoneIy

01:36:46.654 --> 01:36:51.692
You WiII never be aIone.
I WiII aIWays be there

01:36:52.947 --> 01:36:54.262
Why are you being so nice to me?

01:36:54.581 --> 01:36:56.347
WeII....I'm a nice guy.

01:36:57.119 --> 01:36:59.063
Had you Ioved me,
your heart WouIdn't break

01:37:01.013 --> 01:37:04.831
That's the probIem With you.
You never take me seriousIy

01:37:05.986 --> 01:37:07.230
But When are you ever serious?

01:37:08.733 --> 01:37:09.183
Right noWI

01:37:09.915 --> 01:37:12.096
You don't reaIIy mean that...
- Not at aII.

01:37:19.338 --> 01:37:20.997
You think you WiII ever faII
in Iove With someone again?

01:37:39.296 --> 01:37:40.849
My silence said it all...

01:37:42.043 --> 01:37:45.682
and Rohit realized that his first love...

01:37:46.424 --> 01:37:47.075
has to be forgotten

01:37:48.406 --> 01:37:50.065
I have to forget my first Iove

01:37:50.909 --> 01:37:52.331
I have to forget my first Iove.

01:37:53.100 --> 01:38:01.020
lt's not easy. lt's not that easy
to forget your first love

01:38:02.071 --> 01:38:04.607
My first Iove... Dev AnandI

01:38:04.991 --> 01:38:08.465

01:39:34.630 --> 01:39:36.325
Yes, that's true.
This is America, anything is possibIe

01:39:36.577 --> 01:39:37.513
Look at my fateI

01:39:38.768 --> 01:39:39.976

01:41:07.571 --> 01:41:08.674

Wherever I go, he foIIoWs me

01:46:16.820 --> 01:46:18.242
And he eavesdrops on
everyone's conversations

01:46:18.663 --> 01:46:21.473

Rohit Ioves Naina...
Naina doesn't Iove Rohit

01:51:45.019 --> 01:51:46.227
She Ioves Aman

01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:49.111
But Aman teIIs Rohit that he
shouIdn't Iet go of Naina so easiIy

01:51:49.365 --> 01:51:51.961
So basicaIIy Aman is... insaneI

01:51:52.216 --> 01:51:54.267
Who are you taIking to?
I haven't gone insane

01:51:54.581 --> 01:51:55.754
Your brains have been dispIaced

01:51:56.215 --> 01:51:57.388
Naina hasn't faIIen in Iove With me

01:51:57.814 --> 01:52:00.138
She just thinks that she has
faIIen in Iove With me.

01:52:00.387 --> 01:52:02.046
She thinks... Ah... she thinksI

01:52:02.300 --> 01:52:03.616
NoW What is 'she thinks'
supposed to mean?

01:52:04.213 --> 01:52:06.500
Man... I am a neW entry

01:52:06.751 --> 01:52:07.687

and she thought she is in Iove With me

01:52:09.289 --> 01:52:10.746
WhiIe you have knoWn her for years...

01:52:10.992 --> 01:52:12.201
she takes you for granted...

01:52:12.766 --> 01:52:14.497
noW she is not going to dream
that you are in Iove With her

01:52:14.887 --> 01:52:18.431
NoW just forget aII this friendship
nonsense and shoW her some Iove man...

01:52:18.990 --> 01:52:20.827
Whether she says 'yes' or
'no' Ieave it to her

01:52:21.111 --> 01:52:23.091
But at Ieast give her a choice...
You keep running after that ChameIi...

01:52:33.454 --> 01:52:34.106

01:52:35.088 --> 01:52:36.617
Naina's beautifuI eyesI

01:52:37.557 --> 01:52:38.695
Naina's IoveIy face

01:52:39.679 --> 01:52:40.887
Naina's fury...

01:52:41.138 --> 01:52:41.897
Naina's Iove...

01:52:42.460 --> 01:52:43.562
Naina's smiIe...

01:52:43.816 --> 01:52:45.131
Whenever she does, that is

01:52:45.729 --> 01:52:47.388
Naina's hair... When she
ties them up Iike this

01:52:47.675 --> 01:52:49.726
ActuaIIy I Iike her hair aII Iet doWn

01:52:56.785 --> 01:52:58.208
Why are you saying, Naina?

01:52:59.428 --> 01:53:01.159
For you... I'm marriedI

01:53:02.697 --> 01:53:03.799
And What if you Weren't?

01:53:04.574 --> 01:53:06.790
Then I WouIdn't Iet go of her.
I'm not an idiot Iike you

01:53:07.216 --> 01:53:09.848
I am taIking about Naina.

01:53:10.416 --> 01:53:13.853
You are rightI NoW What do I do?
- You don't do anything

01:53:14.101 --> 01:53:15.168
NoW Whatever has to be done,
I WiII do

01:53:15.491 --> 01:53:17.851
You just do as I say
I have a pIan...

01:53:18.552 --> 01:53:21.990
six days and girI in your face...
Just six days.

01:53:22.516 --> 01:53:24.626
WoWI But Why six days?

01:53:25.540 --> 01:53:27.448
Because I don't Work on Sundays

01:53:34.685 --> 01:53:35.171
DAY ONE

01:53:37.467 --> 01:53:39.268
Naina Waits for me everyday here at 6 p.m.

01:53:40.179 --> 01:53:41.637
We go together from here to the cIass

01:53:44.386 --> 01:53:46.152
But you Won't go With her today
- Why?

01:53:46.820 --> 01:53:47.887
Because I say so

01:53:48.524 --> 01:53:50.812
Is your pIan to bring us together
or throW us apart?

01:53:51.479 --> 01:53:52.795
I have a theory about girIs

01:53:53.357 --> 01:53:55.894
The more you run after them,
the more they WiII run aWay from you

01:53:56.139 --> 01:53:59.054
But if you run aWay from them they WiII
be confused and WiII run after you...

01:53:59.338 --> 01:54:00.890
to find out the reason for their confusion

01:54:01.216 --> 01:54:03.361
And We have to take advantage of such
a confusion of a confused girI...

01:54:03.962 --> 01:54:05.136
Even I'm confusedI

01:54:05.561 --> 01:54:07.292
That you are... from chiIdhoodI
That can't be heIped...

01:54:07.543 --> 01:54:09.523
but trust me... do as I say

01:54:10.082 --> 01:54:10.876
Put this into your ear

01:54:12.620 --> 01:54:14.078
Put it Where?- In your ear

01:54:17.523 --> 01:54:19.325

01:54:21.834 --> 01:54:24.430

Hi Naina..- Hi Lee.
Thank you for your notes.

01:58:19.769 --> 01:58:20.598
You are WeIcome.

01:58:22.515 --> 01:58:23.523
DAY FOUR

01:58:26.375 --> 01:58:28.212
One second... one second...
HoW far can you run from me darIing?

01:58:28.461 --> 01:58:29.635
Leave my hand... Just Ieave my hand

01:58:29.887 --> 01:58:31.239
I don't knoW What's happened to you,
I think you have gone mad

01:58:31.765 --> 01:58:34.823
For the past three days, I have been
trying...Where Were you, Rohit?

01:58:35.103 --> 01:58:36.596
When I needed a friend,
Where Were you?

01:58:36.841 --> 01:58:39.271
I'm tired... I'm reaIIy
tired of being your friend

01:58:39.796 --> 01:58:40.767
What?- What? What?

01:58:41.013 --> 01:58:41.807
When you Want to Iaugh, it's Rohit...

01:58:42.056 --> 01:58:42.507
When you Want to cry, it's Rohit

01:58:42.752 --> 01:58:43.926
But When you have to Iove,
it's someone eIseI

01:58:44.178 --> 01:58:45.802
It's not going to Work anymore, right?

01:58:46.055 --> 01:58:48.450
Are you aIright, Rohit?
- No, you Iisten to me, Okay.

01:58:48.976 --> 01:58:50.078
We are friends, right?
- Yes...

01:58:50.331 --> 01:58:52.619
So a very inteIIigent man has said that

01:58:52.870 --> 01:58:54.257
the first step to Iove is friendship...

01:58:54.852 --> 01:58:55.646
and the Iast step is friendship too

01:58:57.286 --> 01:58:58.424
It's the middIe that's Ieft

01:59:01.250 --> 01:59:04.688
Take a step Naina and
you WiII find your path

01:59:07.195 --> 01:59:10.289
Think....Naina... think...

01:59:12.342 --> 01:59:14.417
And to think I give you ...

01:59:17.870 --> 01:59:18.973
my entire Iife

01:59:24.129 --> 01:59:25.232
Wonder what Rohit meant

01:59:26.598 --> 01:59:28.364
That day l felt Rohit had
ceased to be my friend...

01:59:28.858 --> 01:59:29.758
he had become something else

01:59:30.874 --> 01:59:34.762
And what that 'something else' was...
l didn't know... Didn't know...

01:59:36.472 --> 01:59:37.053
DAY FIVE.

01:59:48.781 --> 01:59:50.892

02:00:15.694 --> 02:00:17.009
''On you I'm sure it WiII Iook smart''

02:00:17.328 --> 02:00:18.501
''It's not a gift... it's something
I don't knoW What to caII...''

02:00:19.032 --> 02:00:20.655
''Isn't Subhash Ghai's fiIm
caIIed 'TaaI'? ''

02:00:22.265 --> 02:00:24.316
''P.S. Sorry couIdn't think

02:00:26.438 --> 02:00:27.124
''Love Rohit''

02:00:29.115 --> 02:00:29.731
DAY SIX

02:00:31.723 --> 02:00:32.339
What's this?

02:00:33.809 --> 02:00:36.239
''I'm not a poet.
O damseI, I surrender...''

02:00:36.834 --> 02:00:39.644
''Cos the next Iines of the song
I do not rememberI''

02:00:40.450 --> 02:00:41.624
What's going on?

02:00:42.501 --> 02:00:43.995

and I have to perform an item?
Don't ask me, okay?

02:00:56.618 --> 02:01:00.127
Look, I can't do that 'Dandia' Okay.

02:01:00.548 --> 02:01:02.563
So I thought... Why not SaIsa?

02:01:03.364 --> 02:01:06.031
I need a partner to join the cIasses

02:01:06.737 --> 02:01:13.056
Since you are going to be my Iife
partner, Why not start noW? - NO

02:01:15.152 --> 02:01:17.167

And What did you do?
ToId him everythingI

02:10:23.134 --> 02:10:25.837
And he... He, Who Wants

Iove me, he WouId find Iove for me...

02:10:31.653 --> 02:10:33.312

But at Ieast I had a friendI

02:10:58.809 --> 02:11:00.991
But today you have
taken that aWay from me...

02:11:01.765 --> 02:11:02.559
Both of you

02:11:03.677 --> 02:11:06.735
Just Iisten, Naina...- No.

02:11:12.370 --> 02:11:13.579
NoI I don't Want to hear anything

02:11:14.108 --> 02:11:15.531
I don't Want to
understand anything

02:11:15.846 --> 02:11:17.862
For God's sake, just Ieave me aIoneI

02:11:22.418 --> 02:11:22.998
Just a sec...

02:11:25.200 --> 02:11:28.744
Naina, I Wish I couId
teII you hoW much I Iove you

02:11:29.024 --> 02:11:35.213
One sec. Wait, I Iove you
very much...

02:11:39.630 --> 02:11:43.376
And then it says...
I Iove you & ...

02:11:45.366 --> 02:11:49.112
And When I cIose my eyes I see you

02:11:51.625 --> 02:11:54.328
When I open my eyes,
I Iong to see you

02:11:56.528 --> 02:11:57.108
Even When you are not near me,

02:11:57.397 --> 02:11:58.712
I feeI you in everything I'm surrounded by...

02:11:58.962 --> 02:12:01.630
Every second... every minute...

02:12:04.526 --> 02:12:07.584
my eyes search
onIy for my dear Naina

02:12:09.219 --> 02:12:13.144
CaII it Iove, madness or
just my heartbeats...

02:12:14.435 --> 02:12:15.229
it's the same thing for me

02:12:18.433 --> 02:12:19.748
A Iot of peopIe have Ioved before...

02:12:20.693 --> 02:12:23.397
but my Iove stands apart
from aII of them because...

02:12:24.101 --> 02:12:24.895
they don't have you

02:12:29.177 --> 02:12:30.457
I can never forget you Naina

02:12:31.263 --> 02:12:34.322
I don't Want to forget you

02:12:35.089 --> 02:12:38.633
You are mine and I WiII Iove you forever

02:12:39.261 --> 02:12:42.770
I WiII Iove you tiII I die...
and even after thatI

02:12:52.474 --> 02:12:58.306
AII this is Written in this diary...
Rohit has Written aII of it

02:12:59.080 --> 02:13:00.218
HoW can he hurt... ?

02:13:02.210 --> 02:13:04.391
And you have such
a bad handWriting

02:13:34.511 --> 02:13:36.692
Aman... aII this... I didn't...

02:13:36.945 --> 02:13:38.438
You didn't Write...
but I said it

02:13:39.066 --> 02:13:41.602
If you had to Write it,
you WouId Write the same thing

02:13:41.848 --> 02:13:44.800
So I said What Was in your heart...
What's the big deaI? Right?

02:13:45.151 --> 02:13:48.862
And girIs Iike aII this...
I have done it a Iot

02:13:49.845 --> 02:13:50.295
Are you okay?

02:13:51.931 --> 02:13:55.049
I just Want to make a caII.
Excuse meI

02:14:22.564 --> 02:14:24.579
Sorry Mom It's Iate, Iet's go

02:14:27.258 --> 02:14:29.724
I Want to say something
to you... just Iisten

02:14:31.013 --> 02:14:38.755
Naina, to sustain IifeIong...

02:14:39.880 --> 02:14:43.282
every reIationship has to
have strength aIong With Iove

02:14:45.965 --> 02:14:51.169
Your Papa Ioved us a Iot,
but he Was a Weak man

02:14:53.475 --> 02:14:54.648
He Ieft us aII and Went aWay...

02:14:56.604 --> 02:15:01.501
didn't even for a moment think
What WouId become of us after him

02:15:04.775 --> 02:15:09.292
But Rohit... Rohit is not Weak...

02:15:10.165 --> 02:15:11.931
he Ioves you a Iot

02:15:14.511 --> 02:15:17.048
HoW easy it is for you
to say Papa Was WeakI

02:15:18.858 --> 02:15:23.481
And Rohit... taking someone
eIse's heIp to attain your Iove...

02:15:23.761 --> 02:15:26.819
isn't that a sign of Weakness?
TeII me Mama...

02:15:30.366 --> 02:15:32.025
To attain his Iove
he sought heIp...

02:15:32.975 --> 02:15:34.113
What's Wrong With that?

02:15:36.625 --> 02:15:42.814
Look, I stiII maintain Rohit
is not a Weak man

02:15:45.144 --> 02:15:50.289
He knoWs you Iove someone eIse
and yet he is WiIIing to accept you

02:15:52.272 --> 02:15:56.196
That's strength, my chiId.
That's Iove.

02:15:59.956 --> 02:16:05.587
If you reject his Iove today,
it WiII be a girI's decision...

02:16:09.866 --> 02:16:15.355
and tomorroW When you repent it,
it WiII be a Woman's regretI

02:16:27.077 --> 02:16:27.693
HeIIo.

02:16:28.156 --> 02:16:29.993

Everybody...I need a hug

02:21:58.892 --> 02:22:01.322
The next step was to convince
Karsanbhai and Sarlaben...

02:22:03.064 --> 02:22:06.645
which wasn't very difficult.
After all...

02:22:07.377 --> 02:22:07.649

She is not oursI- Dadi.

02:23:30.512 --> 02:23:34.578
No, no, Gia is as much ours
as Naina is

02:23:37.189 --> 02:23:42.915
And my husband didn't die
of a heart attack...

02:23:44.316 --> 02:23:45.561
he commited suicide

02:24:03.162 --> 02:24:04.750
Why did you have to
teII them the truth?

02:24:05.665 --> 02:24:07.740
You cannot base neW
reIationships on a Iie

02:24:08.030 --> 02:24:09.381
You couIdn't handIe
oId reIationships

02:24:09.629 --> 02:24:10.909
HoW WiII you knoW
hoW to handIe neW ones?

02:24:11.159 --> 02:24:13.139
ReIationships are not handIed.
They are maintained

02:24:13.385 --> 02:24:14.558
But What WouId you knoW about them?

02:24:14.811 --> 02:24:15.462
NoW Iisten my dear daughter-in-IaW...

02:24:16.479 --> 02:24:19.846
I WiII onIy be your daughter-in-IaW
the day Gia is your grand daughter

02:24:20.095 --> 02:24:22.798
Gia Was not my grand daughter
and she WiII never beI

02:24:23.051 --> 02:24:23.916
BIood is bIood after aIII

02:24:24.163 --> 02:24:26.973
That's itI I don't Want to hear anymoreI

02:24:27.224 --> 02:24:29.548
Why? When you are so fond
of saying the truth...

02:24:29.797 --> 02:24:33.827
Iearn to Iisten to it too.
Gia is not my grand daughter

02:24:34.942 --> 02:24:38.760
She is not a part of this famiIy
She is just a burden...

02:24:39.045 --> 02:24:43.206
a burden Which you thrust
on this famiIy by adopting her

02:24:44.365 --> 02:24:48.466
A burden Which took aWay
aII the happiness in the famiIy...

02:24:48.746 --> 02:24:52.005
took aWay peace...took aWay my son...

02:24:54.553 --> 02:24:58.026
I hate her... I hate her...
I hate that nasty IittIe...

02:24:58.273 --> 02:24:58.889
NOI

02:25:11.208 --> 02:25:13.946
We are stiII paying
for my son's mistakes

02:25:14.233 --> 02:25:15.856
The first mistake he made
Was marrying you

02:25:16.145 --> 02:25:17.532
The second Was adopting that girI

02:25:17.780 --> 02:25:18.989
He made a third one too

02:25:19.274 --> 02:25:22.855
You? Who the heII are you to
interfere in our famiIy matters?

02:25:23.134 --> 02:25:28.208
No one... Just a voice that shouId
have reached you a Iong time ago

02:25:29.358 --> 02:25:32.417
A truth that you shouId
have reaIized Iong ago

02:25:33.113 --> 02:25:35.649
PIease Jenny, pIease Iet me

02:25:37.564 --> 02:25:40.029
Since you are harping on the truth,
I WouId Iike to teII you a truth too

02:25:40.867 --> 02:25:44.506
About your son's
iIIicit reIationship...

02:25:46.709 --> 02:25:48.511
Which he hid from aII of you

02:25:49.246 --> 02:25:51.048
But he couIdn't hide its resuIt

02:25:51.820 --> 02:25:53.207
Do you knoW the name of the resuIt?

02:25:53.524 --> 02:25:56.298
Aman pIease.- Jenny, it's aIright.

02:25:58.740 --> 02:26:00.162
The resuIt Was Gia...

02:26:02.842 --> 02:26:03.293
GiaI

02:26:04.128 --> 02:26:05.895
Who couId not be accepted
by her oWn mother...

02:26:06.354 --> 02:26:09.306
but Was accepted by
your daughter-in-IaW, Jenny...

02:26:11.430 --> 02:26:14.453
Was brought into this house
by your daughter-in-IaW, Jenny...

02:26:15.638 --> 02:26:18.827
Jenny... Who couId have seen the face
of the other Woman in Gia's face...

02:26:20.053 --> 02:26:22.590
Who couId have seen her husband's
mistakes in that face...

02:26:23.531 --> 02:26:26.067
But What she chose
to see Were those incompIete eyes...

02:26:28.260 --> 02:26:30.132
and she chose to compIete those
eyes by fiIIing them With Iove...

02:26:31.667 --> 02:26:32.770
your daughter-in-IaW Jenny

02:26:44.915 --> 02:26:47.760
Your son WouId have understood
her hurt and her anger...

02:26:48.878 --> 02:26:50.573
but he couIdn't understand
her acceptance

02:26:51.382 --> 02:26:55.021
Jenny's strength reminded him
every minute of his oWn Weakness...

02:26:56.806 --> 02:27:01.287
and it Was this feeIing that
took his Iife... Not Jenny

02:27:08.106 --> 02:27:09.078
Dear Jennifer

02:27:10.123 --> 02:27:14.391
l know in these last six years
l have only enquired about Gia...

02:27:15.200 --> 02:27:16.728

Thank y ou Jennifer. Thank y ou

02:27:28.760 --> 02:27:32.542
Women are built to forgive the
mistakes that their husbands make...

02:27:33.593 --> 02:27:38.833
but very few women have the courage
to accept the mistake...

02:27:39.574 --> 02:27:43.249
and shower love to such a degree
that it doesn't remain a mistake

02:27:44.129 --> 02:27:49.819
y ou accepted Gia when l, her mother,
couldn't accept her

02:27:50.492 --> 02:27:52.779
And for this l will always
remain indebted to you

02:27:53.865 --> 02:27:56.010
They say that when
a man makes a mistake...

02:27:56.542 --> 02:27:59.351
he also possesses the ability
to pay the price for it

02:28:00.019 --> 02:28:05.472
But Jennifer, all these years you have
paid a price for a mistake...

02:28:06.069 --> 02:28:07.348
that was not yours
in the first place

02:28:08.468 --> 02:28:09.784
And all that because of me

02:28:11.146 --> 02:28:12.769
lf you can, please forgive me

02:28:14.275 --> 02:28:15.555

And finally Gia's perfect family
was complete... complete

02:29:19.261 --> 02:29:20.754
All the distances were bridged...

02:29:21.695 --> 02:29:24.683
and we started praying together...

02:29:26.041 --> 02:29:27.665

02:29:28.475 --> 02:29:31.046
The engagement preparations
had begun in full swing!

02:29:32.439 --> 02:29:35.947

02:29:39.775 --> 02:29:40.534

God had heard Kantaben's prayers.
Rohit was getting married to a girl

02:30:07.939 --> 02:30:09.219
Finally, the day of the engagement...

02:30:12.946 --> 02:30:18.186

Punjab in its characteristic splendour

02:30:43.683 --> 02:30:46.706
''G-U-J-J-U''
