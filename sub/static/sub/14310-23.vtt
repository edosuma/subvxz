[theme music]

00:05.080 --> 00:08.119
(male narrator)
Long, long ago,
deep in the forest

00:08.140 --> 00:12.070
there was a hidden village
where tiny creatures lived.

00:12.089 --> 00:15.019
They called themselves Smurfs.

00:15.039 --> 00:16.199
They were good.

00:18.120 --> 00:21.010
[music continues]

00:22.100 --> 00:26.120
Then there was Gargamel,
the evil wizard.

00:26.140 --> 00:27.219
He was bad.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.089
Oh, I hate Smurfs!

00:31.120 --> 00:34.020
I'll get you,
I'll get all of you

00:34.039 --> 00:36.140
if it's the last thing
I ever do!

00:36.159 --> 00:38.109
[evil laugh]

00:38.130 --> 00:39.170
Oh!

00:39.189 --> 00:41.109
Oh, I'll get you!

00:41.130 --> 00:44.140
'I'll find your village someday.
You'll be sorry.'

00:44.159 --> 00:47.030
(male narrator)
Well, the forest
is still there.

00:47.049 --> 00:51.030
And if you listen,
you may hear Gargamel's rage.

00:51.049 --> 00:53.210
And if you are good
you may just

00:53.229 --> 00:57.020
catch a glimpse of the Smurfs.

00:59.149 --> 01:01.200
[theme music]

01:04.180 --> 01:07.069
[instrumental music]

01:09.060 --> 01:11.039
[snoring]

01:14.129 --> 01:17.000
(Clumsy Smurf)
Papa Smurf, look what I found.

01:17.019 --> 01:19.069
And there's a whole tree full
right over..

01:21.010 --> 01:22.159
Oh. Uh, well..

01:22.180 --> 01:26.200
Uh, gee, uh, sorry,
I-I didn't know.

01:26.219 --> 01:30.019
Squirrels must smurf
for the winter too, Clumsy.

01:30.039 --> 01:33.210
Ah, the apples.
Smurf them over there, Hefty.

01:35.099 --> 01:36.129
Right, Papa Smurf.

01:36.150 --> 01:39.109
Everybody, this way.

01:39.129 --> 01:41.159
I hate this way.

01:44.030 --> 01:46.159
- Okay, Handy.
- 'That'll smurf it.'

01:46.180 --> 01:49.039
- 'It's all full, Papa Smurf.'
- Good.

01:49.060 --> 01:52.159
Now, we'll have plenty
to eat all winter.

01:52.180 --> 01:55.099
[instrumental music]

01:56.170 --> 01:58.200
[yawns]

01:58.219 --> 02:00.200
[chuckles]
It snowed.

02:00.219 --> 02:03.159
Ha-ha-ha. It snowed.

02:07.049 --> 02:10.020
[clamoring]

02:10.038 --> 02:11.038
I hate..

02:11.060 --> 02:12.120
splat

02:12.139 --> 02:14.219
Aren't you gonna smurf
with us, Papa Smurf?

02:15.000 --> 02:18.229
Oh, no, Smurfette, heh-heh-heh,
I'm much too old.

02:19.009 --> 02:21.060
[whistling]

02:26.069 --> 02:27.090
splat

02:27.110 --> 02:29.020
Hey, who did that?

02:29.039 --> 02:31.180
[whistling]

02:31.199 --> 02:35.110
Gee, that sure is
a smurfy snowman, Greedy.

02:35.129 --> 02:38.099
Yeah, except I get hungry
every time I look at him.

02:38.120 --> 02:39.139
[bell ringing]

02:39.159 --> 02:42.060
- 'What's that?'
- The alarm.

02:42.079 --> 02:44.009
(Papa Smurf)
'Fire, fire!'

02:44.030 --> 02:46.030
(all)
Fire. Fire!

02:46.050 --> 02:48.099
[clamoring]

02:48.120 --> 02:51.139
Oh, no. The storehouse.

02:51.159 --> 02:53.030
Hurry, smurf some buckets.

02:53.050 --> 02:55.219
Form a line from the lake.
Move it.

02:58.210 --> 03:01.139
Great smurfs, i-it's frozen.

03:01.159 --> 03:03.210
Hey! Whoa!

03:03.229 --> 03:05.120
crash

03:05.139 --> 03:08.099
Hefty, really,
Papa Smurf said to hurry.

03:08.120 --> 03:11.060
This is not the time
for you to be taking a smurf.

03:13.199 --> 03:15.009
splat

03:16.000 --> 03:17.079
- Take this.
- Got it.

03:17.099 --> 03:18.229
- Here.
- Give it to me.

03:19.009 --> 03:20.199
- Got it.
- Smurf it up.

03:20.219 --> 03:22.129
Faster, faster.

03:23.110 --> 03:25.159
crackle

03:25.180 --> 03:27.000
boing

03:27.020 --> 03:29.060
The water's frozen.

03:29.079 --> 03:32.189
They're all frozen.
This is terrible. Terrible.

03:32.210 --> 03:34.110
It certainly is, Papa Smurf.

03:34.129 --> 03:37.219
"Where there's smoke, there is
fire," I always say. And..

03:38.000 --> 03:39.069
[explosions]

03:40.210 --> 03:43.159
(Grouchy)
Help, the fire's
popping the nuts.

03:43.180 --> 03:45.069
(Brainy)
Smurf for cover.

03:45.090 --> 03:47.079
[all yelling]

03:50.120 --> 03:51.199
chomp

03:51.219 --> 03:55.189
Mm. I love roasted chestnuts.

03:57.199 --> 04:01.020
Nothing. We have nothing
left to eat.

04:01.039 --> 04:03.110
- Oh, no.
- What are we gonna do?

04:03.129 --> 04:06.110
But-but we'll,
we'll smurf from hunger.

04:06.129 --> 04:09.069
Oh, Papa Smurf,
what are we gonna do?

04:09.090 --> 04:11.210
Now, now, my Smurfs.
Don't panic.

04:11.229 --> 04:14.000
I'll think of something.

04:16.230 --> 04:18.139
I hope.

04:20.019 --> 04:22.079
...and then a big plate of
sarsaparilla

04:22.100 --> 04:26.170
covered with whipped cream
and great big smurfberry.

04:26.189 --> 04:28.160
Thank you for inspiring me,
Greedy.

04:28.180 --> 04:31.100
Now, I can write
my great and masterful work

04:31.120 --> 04:33.050
"Ode to Hunger."

04:34.159 --> 04:37.120
Sorry, snowman,
but there's only one of you

04:37.139 --> 04:39.129
and 100 of us.

04:41.100 --> 04:43.009
Oh, goodness smurfness.

04:43.029 --> 04:45.040
I'm wasting away to nothing.

04:45.060 --> 04:50.110
Oh, I'm so hungry,
I could eat a, a, a snowball.

04:50.129 --> 04:54.000
I can't let
my little Smurfs starve.

04:54.019 --> 04:57.189
There's only one thing to do.

04:57.209 --> 05:01.060
My little Smurfs,
there is only one thing to do.

05:01.079 --> 05:04.069
We must abandon
the Smurf Village.

05:04.089 --> 05:06.009
Abandon the village?

05:06.029 --> 05:09.009
- What will we smurf?
- I hate abandoning.

05:09.029 --> 05:11.209
[indistinct chatter]

05:11.230 --> 05:15.139
Oh, no, Papa Smurf.
This is my home.

05:15.160 --> 05:17.060
[sobbing]

05:17.079 --> 05:19.199
I don't wanna smurf
anywhere else.

05:19.220 --> 05:23.139
I know, Smurfette, but leaving
the village is our only hope.

05:23.160 --> 05:25.110
- But where will we go?
- South.

05:25.129 --> 05:28.019
We're bound
to find food to the south.

05:28.040 --> 05:30.069
Now, all of you,
gather your things.

05:30.089 --> 05:31.129
But we must travel light

05:31.149 --> 05:34.040
so bring only
the bare essentials.

05:35.100 --> 05:38.129
Uh, we're all ready to go,
Papa Smurf.

05:38.149 --> 05:40.110
(Papa Smurf)
'Alright, Clumsy.'

05:41.100 --> 05:44.100
Oh, my smurf in heavens.

Goodbye, village.

05:56.170 --> 05:59.019
[wolf howling]

06:07.079 --> 06:09.160
I can't go on, Papa Smurf.

06:09.180 --> 06:11.120
I just can't.

06:11.139 --> 06:14.019
But we must, or we'll freeze.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.149
Stay together and keep moving.

06:17.230 --> 06:19.199
'A castle. Quickly, quickly.'

06:19.220 --> 06:21.060
'Follow me.'

06:23.009 --> 06:24.110
[knock on door]

06:24.129 --> 06:25.189
I don't hear anyone.

06:25.209 --> 06:28.029
It looks kind of old,
Papa Smurf.

06:28.050 --> 06:30.029
Maybe it's deserted.

06:30.050 --> 06:32.170
[yelling]

06:32.189 --> 06:35.120
[dramatic music]

06:36.129 --> 06:38.100
(Papa Smurf)
It looks deserted.

06:38.120 --> 06:40.050
Quickly, inside.

06:44.199 --> 06:47.139
Yuck. This place is dirty.

06:47.159 --> 06:49.230
Uh, and scary.

06:50.009 --> 06:53.230
There's nothing to fear
but fear itself, Clumsy.

06:54.009 --> 06:56.069
I always say..

06:56.090 --> 06:58.120
[gasps]

06:58.139 --> 06:59.129
Don't worry, Brainy.

06:59.149 --> 07:01.089
It's probably just the wind.

07:01.110 --> 07:04.040
Now, let's see
if we can find some food.

07:04.060 --> 07:06.069
I'll eat to that.

07:08.220 --> 07:11.110
[howling]

07:11.129 --> 07:13.180
That doesn't sound
like wind to me.

07:13.199 --> 07:16.029
True, Brainy,
but we didn't come all this way

07:16.050 --> 07:18.129
to be scared off
by strange noises.

07:18.149 --> 07:21.000
Smurfs, forward.

07:22.019 --> 07:24.160
[intense music]

07:26.069 --> 07:28.000

07:33.170 --> 07:35.120
(Brainy)
'Wha-what's that?'

07:35.139 --> 07:37.170
I'll take care of him,
Papa Smurf.

07:37.189 --> 07:41.060
I'll spiff up the floor
with him. I'll..

07:41.079 --> 07:44.090
Ha! See?
He never stood a chance.

07:46.180 --> 07:49.000
(Brainy)
That doesn't look
like a v-very good place

07:49.019 --> 07:51.139
to g-go, Papa Smurf.

07:51.159 --> 07:54.040
[howling]

07:54.060 --> 07:56.199
- What's that?
- Shh. Someone's coming.

07:56.220 --> 07:58.120
(Brainy)
'G-ghost!'

07:59.069 --> 08:01.050
I knew it.

08:01.069 --> 08:04.129
- Le-let's smurf out of here.
- Yeah, let's run.

08:04.149 --> 08:07.110
I know there are
no such things as ghosts.

08:07.129 --> 08:08.209
[footsteps approaching]

08:08.230 --> 08:12.129
But, m-maybe I should
check on my little Smurfs.

08:18.199 --> 08:21.060
If Papa Smurf says
there's no ghosts

08:21.079 --> 08:22.129
then there's no ghosts.

08:22.149 --> 08:24.060
Because if Papa Smurf says
there's..

08:24.079 --> 08:25.060
[growling]

08:25.079 --> 08:26.220
[screams]

08:27.000 --> 08:30.149
- Brainy, uh, what's wrong?
- Ghosts.

08:30.170 --> 08:33.058
I heard ghosts growling.

08:35.169 --> 08:38.220
Did anyone ever tell you you're
beautiful when you're mad?

08:39.000 --> 08:40.190
[harpsichord music]

08:40.210 --> 08:42.058
Listen.

08:42.080 --> 08:45.000
Someone likes music.

08:45.019 --> 08:46.230
Let's hope he likes food.

08:47.009 --> 08:49.029
Well, if he's a ghost,
let me at him.

08:49.049 --> 08:51.049
Just let me at him.

08:51.070 --> 08:52.120
[door creaks]

[Smurfs screaming]

08:57.090 --> 08:58.159
Hmm.

09:00.039 --> 09:01.100
What's that?

09:05.129 --> 09:08.139
I was right.
There are no ghosts.

09:09.059 --> 09:10.029
screech

09:10.049 --> 09:11.120
sniff sniff sniff

09:11.139 --> 09:14.039
I don't smell food anywhere.

09:14.059 --> 09:17.080
And-and I don't see
Papa Smurf anywhere.

09:17.100 --> 09:21.029
- Maybe the g-ghost got him.
- I hate ghosts.

09:21.049 --> 09:23.120

09:23.139 --> 09:25.190
[all screaming]

09:25.210 --> 09:27.120
[grunts]

09:29.139 --> 09:33.039
- Papa Smurf?
- Where are you, Papa Smurf?

09:34.049 --> 09:36.049
- Brainy.
- Yipes!

09:36.070 --> 09:37.070
Oof.

09:37.090 --> 09:40.070
- Oof.
- Brainy, why are you so..

09:40.090 --> 09:41.139
Brainy.

09:41.159 --> 09:43.019
clang

09:45.000 --> 09:47.220
So you see, the candelabra
wasn't really floating

09:48.000 --> 09:50.100
the harpsichord
wasn't really playing itself

09:50.120 --> 09:54.080
and I'm sure there's no ghost
inside that headless knight.

09:54.100 --> 09:57.159
Of course not. I knew it
all the time, Papa Smurf.

09:57.179 --> 10:01.149
I always say that you should
always look before..

10:03.019 --> 10:04.200
...you leap.

10:06.080 --> 10:08.080
Now, if we can just think
of a way

10:08.100 --> 10:11.009
to get our mysterious host
to show himself.

10:11.029 --> 10:13.220
'Jokey, did you pack
all your essentials?'

10:14.000 --> 10:16.049
Yes, Papa Smurf.

10:16.070 --> 10:17.220
[growling]

10:18.230 --> 10:21.080
[laughing]

10:21.100 --> 10:22.220
Hi, Mr. Knight.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.210
I brought you a present.

10:24.230 --> 10:28.169
[laughs]
It's a surprise.

10:29.110 --> 10:30.179
boom

10:32.090 --> 10:35.049
- Are you alright, sir?
- Huh?

10:35.070 --> 10:37.210
- I said, "Are you alright?"
- No.

10:37.230 --> 10:40.049
I mean, yes, I-I'm fine.

10:40.070 --> 10:41.200
Th-thank you very much.

10:41.220 --> 10:43.070
Who are you?

10:43.090 --> 10:45.210
I am Papa Smurf and these are..

10:45.230 --> 10:49.220
- Smurf? What's a Smurf?
- We live in the forest.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.009
We came to get out of the cold
and hope there might be--

10:53.029 --> 10:54.169
Something to smurf.

10:54.190 --> 10:56.179
[indistinct chatter]

10:58.009 --> 10:59.090
[clears throat]
Uh..

10:59.110 --> 11:02.169
They're asking if you have
anything to, uh, eat.

11:02.190 --> 11:04.059
To eat? Uh-uh.

11:04.080 --> 11:08.000
You see, there's a real ghost
who lives here in the castle

11:08.019 --> 11:10.059
and he steals all my food.

11:10.080 --> 11:13.129
'Huh. Bu-but I do have something
I can share.'

11:13.149 --> 11:15.070
Real ghosts?

11:17.070 --> 11:18.210
Here we are.

[all cheering]

(Mr. Poppery)
'It isn't much, but it's
all I have, I'm afraid.'

11:24.190 --> 11:28.159
Everything I've had, it just
slowly disappeared somehow.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.129
- Our dinner.
- Let's go after him.

11:33.149 --> 11:37.090
You dirty rat.
Come back here with our bread.

11:41.220 --> 11:43.049
[Smurfs shouting]

11:43.070 --> 11:44.179
Whoa!

11:44.200 --> 11:46.210
[all grunting]

11:54.009 --> 11:57.100
Oh, Smurfs,
how can I thank you?

11:57.120 --> 12:01.070
You found everything
that pack rat ever stole.

12:01.090 --> 12:04.090
Thank you for your generosity,
Mr. Poppery.

12:04.110 --> 12:07.059
Won't you take some gold coins,
or diamonds?

12:07.080 --> 12:09.220
I'll never be able
to spend it all.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.110
No, thank you.

12:11.129 --> 12:13.149
We have no use for such things.

12:13.169 --> 12:15.029
Food is all we need.

12:15.049 --> 12:17.100
Goodbye, Mr. Poppery.

12:21.009 --> 12:23.139
[chattering]

12:24.049 --> 12:26.139
[chuckling]

12:26.159 --> 12:28.129
I hear you, little fella.

12:28.149 --> 12:31.110
From now on,
we'll share our food.

12:31.129 --> 12:33.210
[chuckling]

12:36.210 --> 12:40.039
Well, my little Smurfs,
thanks to Mr. Poppery

12:40.059 --> 12:42.059
tonight we can feast.

12:42.080 --> 12:44.139
Excuse me, Papa Smurf.

12:44.159 --> 12:46.220
Greedy, aren't you hungry?

12:47.000 --> 12:49.139
[hiccupping]
Well, to tell you the truth,
Papa Smurf

12:49.159 --> 12:53.009
I had a few snacks
on the, uh, way, uh, over.

12:53.029 --> 12:55.179
[all laughing]

12:59.039 --> 13:02.049
[theme music]
