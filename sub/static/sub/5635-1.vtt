<i>Faster! Faster!</i>

00:20.342 --> 00:22.142
Gene, stop whipping me
with a tube sock.

00:22.143 --> 00:23.611
Well, sorry I don't
have dress socks.

00:23.612 --> 00:24.845
Keep going, Dad.

00:24.846 --> 00:25.980
You're almost
at the water station.

00:25.981 --> 00:26.980
Oh, my God.

00:27.015 --> 00:28.048
Yay, Dad!

00:28.049 --> 00:29.116
You're peddling like crazy

00:29.117 --> 00:30.150
and not getting anywhere.

00:30.151 --> 00:31.150
Just like your life.

00:31.152 --> 00:32.686
Great encouragement, kids!

00:32.686 --> 00:35.188
And... good enough. Oh!

00:35.223 --> 00:36.789
Now, hit the showers,
sweat stuff.

00:36.825 --> 00:39.293
And wash this sock. It's got
your stank all over it.

00:39.294 --> 00:41.061
Boy, your father's getting
a lot of good out of this

00:41.062 --> 00:43.397
old exer-cycle someone
dumped in the alley.

00:43.398 --> 00:45.065
Maybe it was a hint
from a concerned friend,

00:45.066 --> 00:47.200
like someone anonymously
mailing you mouthwash.

00:47.235 --> 00:49.136
Yeah, did you like
the flavor, by the way?

00:49.137 --> 00:50.470
'Cause they also make cinnamon.

00:50.505 --> 00:51.704
No, it was really good.

00:51.740 --> 00:53.640
Oh... Hey!

00:54.910 --> 00:56.210
That's weird.

00:56.211 --> 00:57.443
So, it looks the same?

00:57.479 --> 00:58.579
Yeah, your bald spot is still

00:58.580 --> 00:59.680
exactly the size of the lid

00:59.681 --> 01:00.848
of a mayonnaise jar.

01:00.849 --> 01:02.349
Or a tiny crop circle.

01:02.350 --> 01:03.817
Huh, I guess it's a mystery.

01:03.818 --> 01:05.184
Bob, your mustache!

01:05.220 --> 01:06.686
What?

01:06.721 --> 01:08.255
You're going lip bald!

01:08.256 --> 01:10.156
All right, well,
it doesn't look great.

01:10.191 --> 01:11.525
Or it's sexy.
It shows a little skin,

01:11.526 --> 01:13.494
but leaves something
to the imagination.

01:13.495 --> 01:16.229
"Internet, does
my father have mange?"

01:16.264 --> 01:17.565
Maybe I should
just shave it off.

01:17.566 --> 01:18.599
"Shave it off"?!

01:18.600 --> 01:20.067
No, no, no! You can't!

01:20.068 --> 01:22.069
Bob, your mustache is
like an old friend.

01:22.070 --> 01:23.270
It introduced us.

01:23.271 --> 01:24.370
It was how we met.

01:24.406 --> 01:25.606
Wait, it was how you met?

01:25.607 --> 01:27.074
I thought Mom lost a bet.

01:27.075 --> 01:28.542
Come on, you know this story.

01:28.543 --> 01:29.663
I never told you this story?

01:29.678 --> 01:31.078
Guys, this is our chance to say

01:31.079 --> 01:32.979
"Yes, you did tell us
that story."

01:33.014 --> 01:34.615
I was engaged to Hugo,

01:34.616 --> 01:36.083
but I wasn't that into
hanging out with him.

01:36.084 --> 01:37.518
Here we go.

01:37.519 --> 01:39.019
So, one night, I was
having a quiet cocktail

01:39.020 --> 01:41.388
with my friend Ginger.

01:43.091 --> 01:45.893
So, I said, "That's not
how you throw a shrimp.

01:45.894 --> 01:47.394
This is how you throw a shrimp!"

01:47.395 --> 01:49.563
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ow! Ow! Ow!

01:49.564 --> 01:50.764
Oh, my God!

01:50.765 --> 01:52.066
Hey, you got a lot of nerve

01:52.067 --> 01:53.066
grabbing girls' diamond rings

01:53.101 --> 01:55.402
with your thick, luxurious,

01:55.403 --> 01:57.870
Tom Selleck-Ian mustache.

01:57.906 --> 01:59.106
Hi.
Hi.

01:59.107 --> 02:00.975
Uh, my eyes are up here.

02:00.976 --> 02:02.776
Should we get some scissors?

02:02.777 --> 02:03.877
What's the rush?

02:03.878 --> 02:04.979
What do you mean?

02:04.980 --> 02:06.779
Oh, I... Sorry.

02:06.815 --> 02:09.049
One thing led to another,
and, uh, I gave Hugo

02:09.050 --> 02:11.050
back his ring and told
him I met a mustache.

02:11.086 --> 02:13.954
Whoa! So if Dad didn't have
his mustache that day,

02:13.955 --> 02:16.290
you guys don't click,
don't get together,

02:16.291 --> 02:17.625
we're not born.

02:17.626 --> 02:18.959
A world without a Gene

02:18.960 --> 02:20.627
is not a world
I want to live in!

02:20.662 --> 02:22.396
Oh, please.
Mom and Dad are destined

02:22.397 --> 02:24.064
to get together no matter what.

02:24.065 --> 02:25.733
It's called fate and it's great.

02:25.734 --> 02:27.300
That's an easy way
to remember it.

02:27.335 --> 02:28.969
No, no, no, no.
Shave Dad's face,

02:28.970 --> 02:30.470
Belcher kids are erased.

02:30.505 --> 02:31.939
If Dad's lip has no hair,

02:31.940 --> 02:33.807
we never come out of there.

02:33.808 --> 02:35.309
Well, we'll never really know
what would've happened

02:35.310 --> 02:37.111
if I didn't have
a mustache back then.

02:37.112 --> 02:38.646
But we can wildly speculate.

02:38.647 --> 02:40.146
No. I don't want to do that.

02:40.181 --> 02:41.982
I take you back to that night.

02:41.983 --> 02:45.085
Everything is the same...
almost!

02:45.086 --> 02:46.719
"That's not
how you throw a shrimp.

02:46.755 --> 02:48.454
This is how you throw a shrimp!"

02:48.490 --> 02:50.658
<i>Dad's naked lip is no match</i>

02:50.659 --> 02:54.327
<i>for a small karat, visibly
occluded, rose-cut diamond.</i>

02:54.362 --> 02:56.429
You know a weird amount
about diamonds.

02:56.464 --> 02:58.666
A boy can plan for his big day!

02:58.667 --> 03:00.167
Ow!
Oh, oh, God!

03:00.168 --> 03:01.268
Sorry. Uh-oh!

03:01.269 --> 03:02.369
Got a little blood.

03:02.370 --> 03:03.637
Uh, let me get you a napkin.

03:03.638 --> 03:04.705
Aah!
There you go.

03:04.706 --> 03:05.839
All better. Oh, wait, no.

03:05.840 --> 03:06.940
It's gushing.
Oh, no!

03:06.941 --> 03:08.975
Oh, God.
Oh, God! Oh, God...

03:09.010 --> 03:10.476
<i>I don't really like
the sight of blood, either.</i>

03:10.512 --> 03:12.046
It's like, what is that stuff?!

03:12.047 --> 03:13.146
Hi, Doc.
Sergeant Bosco, PD.

03:13.181 --> 03:15.282
What do you got...
lip job?

03:15.283 --> 03:16.950
Um, it's a simple laceration.

03:16.951 --> 03:18.485
Just a couple of
stitches should do it.

03:18.486 --> 03:19.953
He could be perfect.

03:19.954 --> 03:21.587
You're losing him!
I'm losing him?

03:21.623 --> 03:23.223
Wait, you're losing me?

03:23.224 --> 03:24.524
He's flatlining!

03:24.559 --> 03:26.125
You're making that sound.

03:26.161 --> 03:28.161
Induce coma!
Induce coma?!

03:28.196 --> 03:30.163
I'm commandeering this patient.
Wait!

03:30.198 --> 03:31.931
Let's talk about...

03:31.966 --> 03:34.333
Powering up.

03:36.538 --> 03:38.739
He's on.
How are you feeling?

03:38.740 --> 03:40.307
I don't feel.

03:40.308 --> 03:41.642
What do you remember?

03:41.643 --> 03:43.077
Nothing.
Correct response.

03:43.078 --> 03:44.511
The OS is loaded.

03:44.512 --> 03:47.847
Welcome to the force,
Officer Robo 'Stache.

03:50.464 --> 03:51.964
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Lin!

03:51.965 --> 03:54.133
I'm just giving you
a little comb-over. Ugh.

03:54.134 --> 03:56.669
Gene, why would the police
give me a robotic mustache?

03:56.670 --> 03:58.871
Because they tried robotic
ding-dongs, and they were buggy.

03:58.872 --> 04:00.639
Sure, sure.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.709
<i>But the mustache
unit was bristling</i>

04:02.710 --> 04:04.576
<i>with state-of-the-art
technology.</i>

04:04.611 --> 04:07.746
<i>.45-caliber revolver, tear gas,
paper shredder,</i>

04:07.781 --> 04:09.682
<i>universal remote,
pencil sharpener,</i>

04:09.683 --> 04:11.784
<i>toothpick, melon baller.</i>

04:11.785 --> 04:14.020
Robo 'Stache,
you are fully trained.

04:14.021 --> 04:15.788
We've uploaded police academy
to your brain.

04:15.789 --> 04:17.488
The movies
and the actual training.

04:17.524 --> 04:20.692
<i>They are funny, except for
 Miami Beach.</i>

04:20.694 --> 04:22.694
That is correct.
What are your directives?

04:22.730 --> 04:25.030
Serve the public,
protect the innocent.

04:25.065 --> 04:26.632
Dance like no one's watching.

04:26.633 --> 04:28.167
And a fourth hidden secret one

04:28.168 --> 04:29.702
I'm not allowed to know about

04:29.703 --> 04:32.003
but shouldn't concern me
in the slightest.

04:32.039 --> 04:33.472
Perfect. Now hit the streets!

04:33.507 --> 04:35.208
<i>The new broom on Dad's lip</i>

04:35.209 --> 04:36.642
<i>swept the city clean.</i>

04:36.643 --> 04:38.376
Hold it, punk.

04:38.412 --> 04:39.711
Hold it, pug.

04:39.747 --> 04:41.914
Drop the loot, scum.

04:41.915 --> 04:43.515
It's take-a-penny,
leave-a-penny!

04:43.550 --> 04:46.518
More like take-a-tase,
take-a-tase.

04:46.553 --> 04:49.522
Indecent exposure!

04:49.523 --> 04:51.891
Ow, my butt cheeks!
Why would you do that?

04:51.892 --> 04:53.893
So, I'm kind of
nitpicky as a cop.

04:53.894 --> 04:55.394
No, you're not good.

04:55.395 --> 04:56.929
Just keep going, Gene.

04:56.930 --> 04:58.698
♪ I'm engaged to Hugo! ♪

04:58.699 --> 05:00.733
♪ Is that good?
I don't know! ♪

05:00.734 --> 05:03.301
Public nuisance detected! ♪ As
long as I don't think about it ♪

05:03.337 --> 05:04.737
♪ Too much, yeah ♪
Beanbag deployed.

05:04.772 --> 05:06.706
♪ I... ♪ Aah!
Oh, my mouth!

05:06.707 --> 05:08.807
Hey, it's you!
You a cop now?

05:08.842 --> 05:11.076
You look different with
that mustache. You look good!

05:11.111 --> 05:12.578
Compliment accepted.

05:12.579 --> 05:14.247
I'll pass that along
to my supervisors.

05:14.248 --> 05:15.747
They'll be jazzed.

05:15.783 --> 05:17.983
You have the right to
buy me a cup of coffee.

05:18.018 --> 05:19.752
Please don't use cute cop speak.

05:19.753 --> 05:21.191
It's not cute.

05:21.221 --> 05:23.623
So tell me about yourself.

05:23.624 --> 05:25.124
There's not much to tell.

05:25.125 --> 05:26.959
My ding-dong is not robotic.
They are buggy. Oh.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.360
<i>Gene!</i>

05:28.395 --> 05:30.863
It was bound to come up!
See, Gene?

05:30.864 --> 05:32.532
You couldn't stop fate
even in your own story.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.600
Dad has a mustache, and he
and Mom are hitting it off

05:34.601 --> 05:35.968
like peanut butter and Jerry.

05:35.969 --> 05:37.403
You know, that kid from school

05:37.404 --> 05:38.805
who has peanut butter
every day? Jerry?

05:38.806 --> 05:40.640
Uh, uh, uh, don't get attached,

05:40.641 --> 05:43.976
because not everyone lives...
hint, hint. No!

05:43.977 --> 05:46.411
I can't get over how
handsome you look now.

05:46.446 --> 05:48.915
Thank you. You are the eighth
most attractive woman

05:48.916 --> 05:50.549
I've seen today.
Oh.

05:50.584 --> 05:53.085
I arrested seven
supermodels. Oh!

05:53.086 --> 05:54.954
I mean prostitutes.
Oh.

05:54.955 --> 05:57.622
Of all the women who are not
supermodel-prostitutes,

05:57.658 --> 05:59.091
you are the most attractive.

05:59.092 --> 06:00.960
Aw. How about I give
you a little kiss?

06:00.961 --> 06:02.360
For free, right?

06:02.396 --> 06:05.597
Mmm.  You zapped me!

06:05.632 --> 06:09.100
This is how you throw a shrimp.

06:09.136 --> 06:13.038
We've met before. I know! That's why,
when I saw you, I said, "Hey, it's you!"

06:13.073 --> 06:14.473
You can say that to anyone.

06:14.474 --> 06:15.808
It's always true.

06:15.809 --> 06:17.275
What happened to you?

06:17.311 --> 06:20.146
I don't know,
but I have some questions.

06:20.147 --> 06:22.113
<i>Robo 'Stache
had some questions.</i>

06:22.149 --> 06:23.616
Who is Bob Belcher?

06:23.617 --> 06:25.584
His name is written
in my underwear.

06:25.619 --> 06:27.086
Bob Belcher?
He's one of your parts.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.988
Like a screw,
but not as fancy as a screw.

06:28.989 --> 06:30.589
Ouch.

06:30.624 --> 06:32.792
You mind turning the voltage
down on the mustache?

06:32.793 --> 06:34.659
It's like making out
with a wall socket.

06:34.695 --> 06:36.329
It's hardwired to his brain.

06:36.330 --> 06:38.097
If we do that,
I don't know what'll happen,

06:38.098 --> 06:40.065
except that his brain will
explode, so power down, or...?

06:40.100 --> 06:41.433
What?! That's horrible!

06:41.468 --> 06:42.935
If you don't like it,

06:42.936 --> 06:44.837
take it up with Mr. Fischoeder.
He owns the cops.

06:44.838 --> 06:47.339
He's, uh, not here right now,
but there's a tiny model of him.

06:47.374 --> 06:49.774
"Wonder Wharfopolis?"

06:49.810 --> 06:52.144
Mr. Fischoeder's dream.
Picture this town.

06:52.145 --> 06:53.846
Now picture it gone completely.

06:53.847 --> 06:56.716
Then picture a giant
amusement park as big as a town.

06:56.717 --> 06:59.150
Where will people live?
The people are in the way!

06:59.186 --> 07:01.153
That's why we made Tin Lip
over here.

07:01.154 --> 07:03.022
To drive people out
with nitpicky policing!

07:03.023 --> 07:05.224
The police are just goons
for Mr. Fischoeder?!

07:05.225 --> 07:07.459
Officer Bosco,
you're under arr-rr...

07:07.494 --> 07:09.128
ruh-ruh, uh-ruh...

07:09.129 --> 07:11.230
Ah, the hidden Secret
Fourth Directive:

07:11.231 --> 07:12.998
"Never arrest Officer Bosco."

07:13.033 --> 07:14.599
Oh, that was smart
to put in there.

07:14.635 --> 07:16.068
Mr. F. thinks of everything.

07:16.069 --> 07:17.503
He's a handsome genius.

07:17.504 --> 07:18.905
One more thing.

07:18.906 --> 07:21.040
Not only do I work
for Mr. Fischoeder.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.642
I <i> am</i> Mr. Fischoeder.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.311
Aha! He shouldn't
have done that.

07:25.312 --> 07:26.913
Now Robo 'Stache can arrest him!

07:26.914 --> 07:28.414
Good, Father, good.

07:28.415 --> 07:30.849
Mr. Fischoeder,
you're under arrest.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.585
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

07:32.586 --> 07:35.755
Did I not put in "Never
arrest Mr. Fischoeder"? No.

07:35.756 --> 07:38.925
Well, let me just pop this Bosco
mask back on and, uh...

07:38.926 --> 07:41.727
Let's talk,
man to... mm, cyborg.

07:41.728 --> 07:45.497
What-what if I could give you
a robotic ding-dong? No bugs.

07:45.532 --> 07:47.699
Interesting.
No, thank you.

07:47.734 --> 07:51.169
In that case, I'll have
to keep my robo <i> eye</i> on you.

07:51.204 --> 07:53.138
<i>The battle was intense.</i>

07:53.173 --> 07:54.840
It was like
Terminator versus Roomba.

07:54.841 --> 07:56.409
Laser beam!

07:56.410 --> 07:58.010
Eye scissors!
Tear gas!

07:58.011 --> 07:59.578
Stink eye!
Toothpick!

07:59.579 --> 08:01.346
Pink eye!
Melon baller!

08:01.381 --> 08:03.815
<i>But Robo couldn't
handle the big Fisch.</i>

08:03.850 --> 08:06.052
The pupil becomes the master!

08:08.422 --> 08:10.022
System error.

08:10.023 --> 08:13.058
Contact Mustache Administrator.

08:13.093 --> 08:16.462
Brain explosion any second...

08:16.463 --> 08:17.897
Actually, I think I'm fi...

08:17.898 --> 08:19.365
Oh, God.

08:19.366 --> 08:21.100
Brain explosion hurts so much.

08:21.101 --> 08:23.269
It's like getting water
up your nose, but worse.

08:23.270 --> 08:25.137
Ugh! Let's get this back on.

08:25.138 --> 08:27.106
Oh! One more time.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.308
Now I got it.
That's upside down.

08:29.309 --> 08:30.910
How about you just keep it?

08:30.911 --> 08:33.078
Oh, I don't really
have a place for it.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.813
Well, it's my dying wish, so...

08:34.815 --> 08:36.982
I guess I could put it
on my pet cactus

08:36.984 --> 08:38.985
so it looks like
my cactus has a mustache.

08:38.986 --> 08:40.318
Can you imagine?!

08:40.320 --> 08:41.720
Oh, you're dead.

08:41.755 --> 08:43.155
<i>Dad was dead.</i>

08:43.155 --> 08:44.856
<i>And his mustache was
on a cactus.</i>

08:44.891 --> 08:46.325
And that is what
would've happened

08:46.326 --> 08:47.827
definitely for sure.

08:47.828 --> 08:50.096
Huh. It really makes
you think about stuff.

08:50.097 --> 08:51.464
No, Dad wouldn't die.

08:51.465 --> 08:53.099
Mom and Dad would
end up together!

08:53.100 --> 08:54.467
Also, if they arrested everyone,

08:54.468 --> 08:55.801
who would go
to the amusement park?

08:55.802 --> 08:57.102
German tourists.

08:57.137 --> 08:58.938
Hey, Dad,
I found something here.

08:58.939 --> 09:02.842
"Loss of facial hair can be
caused by testicular failure."

09:02.843 --> 09:04.209
Testicular failure?

09:04.244 --> 09:06.378
Gee, even your testicles
are failures.

09:06.413 --> 09:07.813
They're trying.

09:07.814 --> 09:09.648
Let's just change
the subject, please.

09:09.649 --> 09:11.483
Sure. Sports?
What are they?

09:11.518 --> 09:12.985
I know what would have happened

09:12.986 --> 09:14.687
if Dad met Mom
without a mustache,

09:14.688 --> 09:16.321
and it's even more tragic.

09:16.356 --> 09:17.790
Guys, why are we doing this?

09:17.791 --> 09:19.492
Mom and Dad would always,
always end up together.

09:19.493 --> 09:20.892
Shh, Tina.

09:20.927 --> 09:23.596
Love at first sight
is a powerful thing

09:23.597 --> 09:25.331
between two people.

09:25.332 --> 09:27.033
This is how you throw a shrimp!

09:27.034 --> 09:28.600
Hi. I'm Bob.

09:28.635 --> 09:31.002
But usually one of those people
will not be into it.

09:31.038 --> 09:32.371
Hi. I'm not into it.

09:32.372 --> 09:33.706
And then
it's not powerful at all.

09:33.707 --> 09:34.939
Just sad.

09:34.975 --> 09:37.409
And I'm semi-happily engaged.

09:37.444 --> 09:39.444
But Mom at least had
some advice for Dad.

09:39.479 --> 09:41.714
Look, I'm gonna be blunt.
You're a butter lip.

09:41.715 --> 09:43.849
You need a little face candy.
Cocaine?

09:43.850 --> 09:45.317
No I'm talking about a mustache.

09:45.318 --> 09:46.852
You know the saying.

09:46.853 --> 09:49.321
A gentleman down south,
but a bad boy above the mouth?

09:49.322 --> 09:50.890
I don't know that saying,

09:50.891 --> 09:53.225
but if I had a mustache,
you'd be into it?

09:53.226 --> 09:54.894
Yeah, maybe,
but it doesn't matter.

09:54.895 --> 09:56.862
I'm only in town for one night,
and I'm pretty sure

09:56.863 --> 09:59.198
you can't grow a mustache
in 24 hours, so, bye.

09:59.199 --> 10:01.534
<i>A smarter man would have
known he was getting the brush-off,</i>

10:01.535 --> 10:04.203
<i>but Dad was so hooked on her,
and so stupid,</i>

10:04.204 --> 10:05.804
<i>he took it as a challenge.</i>

10:05.839 --> 10:07.305
<i>Dad tried everything.</i>

10:07.340 --> 10:08.773
<i>He rubbed.</i>

10:08.809 --> 10:09.974
<i>He glued.</i>

10:10.010 --> 10:11.810
<i>He sprayed.</i>

10:13.413 --> 10:17.449
<i>There was only one thing
left to try... a wish.</i>

10:17.484 --> 10:19.684
I wish I had a must...

10:19.719 --> 10:21.520
Out of order, buddy!
Oh, no!

10:21.521 --> 10:23.222
The swami's hand's on the fritz.

10:23.223 --> 10:24.757
His middle finger
keeps popping up.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.057
Not what people are looking for.

10:26.093 --> 10:27.860
Well, then,
can <i> you</i> grant me a wish?

10:27.861 --> 10:29.228
I'm not really qualified.

10:29.229 --> 10:30.896
I mean, I'm just
the repair guy. I...

10:30.897 --> 10:32.297
Look, it's an emergency!

10:32.332 --> 10:34.166
All right, uh, I'll do it,

10:34.167 --> 10:36.167
but if you wish my clothes off,
I'm gonna be mad.

10:36.203 --> 10:37.669
I-I wish I had a mustache.

10:37.704 --> 10:40.038
Uh, your wish is granted.
Great, thank you.

10:40.073 --> 10:42.240
All right,
no guarantees on that.

10:42.275 --> 10:43.441
Bad swami.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.278
<i>At first, nothing happened.</i>

10:46.279 --> 10:48.114
What was I thinking?

10:48.115 --> 10:49.348
<i>And then...</i>

10:52.452 --> 10:55.287
You sweet, magical,
fortune-teller repairman.

10:55.288 --> 10:56.855
Ow.

10:56.890 --> 10:58.290
It's real.
How'd you do it?

10:58.291 --> 10:59.725
Don't worry about the past.

10:59.726 --> 11:01.359
Let's just talk
about our future.

11:01.394 --> 11:03.696
Huh, you got
a little soul patch, too.

11:03.697 --> 11:05.163
Oh, um, so I do.

11:05.198 --> 11:07.365
And kind of a unibrow,
how'd I miss that?

11:07.400 --> 11:10.602
Giant muttonchops
and knuckle Afros

11:10.637 --> 11:13.004
and a bushel of hair coming
out of both ears.

11:13.039 --> 11:14.473
And your nose, too.

11:14.474 --> 11:15.641
Uh, okay, so should we order?

11:15.642 --> 11:16.976
Oh, I'm gonna throw up.
What?

11:16.977 --> 11:18.776
Waiter!

11:20.760 --> 11:21.892
<i>So I'm like a werewolf?</i>

11:21.928 --> 11:23.762
That's kind of fun,
kind of cool.

11:23.763 --> 11:26.365
No, you just have uncontrollable
hair growth everywhere.

11:26.366 --> 11:29.167
That's not really...
that's just uncomfortable.

11:29.168 --> 11:30.602
Yeah.
Don't worry, Dad.

11:30.603 --> 11:32.471
When you're destined
to be together,

11:32.472 --> 11:35.307
uncontrollable hair growth can't
stop uncontrollable love growth.

11:35.308 --> 11:37.309
Shush, shush, Mom was
super grossed out,

11:37.310 --> 11:39.910
so Dad needed to
unwish his wish fast,

11:39.946 --> 11:41.146
<i>but...</i>

11:41.147 --> 11:42.547
Oh, crap, the machine's gone.

11:42.548 --> 11:44.383
I'm stuck like this forever.

11:44.384 --> 11:46.518
<i>Dad was devastated.</i>

11:46.519 --> 11:48.353
<i>He slumped away, hairily.</i>

11:48.354 --> 11:50.789
Bob, wait; You're a good man,
and you did this for me.

11:50.790 --> 11:52.624
Let's try to make
it work.

11:52.625 --> 11:53.958
Are you still gagging?

12:02.185 --> 12:03.184
There you are.

12:03.186 --> 12:05.020
There he is.

12:05.021 --> 12:06.421
You want to see?

12:06.422 --> 12:08.256
Oh, so that was a lot
of work for nothing.

12:08.257 --> 12:09.691
Sorry.

12:09.692 --> 12:10.926
Maybe we should
just go for a walk.

12:10.927 --> 12:12.361
You wanna go for a walk?

12:12.362 --> 12:13.861
Do ya? Do you wanna go?

12:13.896 --> 12:15.763
Uh, can you not
say it like that?

12:15.798 --> 12:17.232
He's excited.

12:17.233 --> 12:18.566
He heard the "W" word.

12:18.601 --> 12:20.768
I'm a little excited,
but please stop.

12:20.803 --> 12:22.437
<i>For a moment there, it seemed</i>

12:22.438 --> 12:24.105
<i>like they had
it all figured out.</i>

12:24.140 --> 12:26.273
Hey, hair ball, put it
in a ponytail, right?!

12:26.309 --> 12:28.143
You're shedding all
over the sidewalk!

12:28.144 --> 12:29.577
Shake it off.

12:29.612 --> 12:31.046
Let's pick up the pace
a little, come on.

12:31.047 --> 12:32.214
Cool...

12:32.215 --> 12:33.748
You see, that guy gets it.

12:33.783 --> 12:37.885
I love it, but society
will never accept you...

12:37.920 --> 12:39.121
He's right.

12:39.122 --> 12:40.555
What kind of future
could I give you?

12:40.556 --> 12:42.958
What can I do with my life,
looking like this?

12:42.959 --> 12:44.393
You could, uh...

12:44.394 --> 12:46.061
Uh...

12:46.062 --> 12:48.429
Uh... Nah. Oh!

12:48.464 --> 12:51.065
<i> So I thought I would be
an excellent freak</i>

12:51.100 --> 12:52.133
in your freak show.

12:52.168 --> 12:53.602
Mm-hmm.

12:53.603 --> 12:55.770
Any, uh, qualifications?

12:55.805 --> 12:57.806
I'm... I'm covered in hair.

12:57.807 --> 12:59.241
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

12:59.242 --> 13:00.642
Education?
What?

13:00.643 --> 13:01.709
Education?
Oh.

13:01.744 --> 13:04.446
I... Yes, Dartmouth.
Ooh.

13:04.447 --> 13:05.447
Uh, I'm sorry, I lied.

13:05.448 --> 13:06.447
I panicked and I lied.

13:06.449 --> 13:07.715
I see.
Harvard.

13:07.750 --> 13:09.083
Oh.
I lied again, I don't...

13:09.118 --> 13:10.718
I...
I didn't go to college.

13:10.753 --> 13:13.588
So you thought you could
just grow your hair a little

13:13.589 --> 13:14.990
and jump into the freak
business, did you?

13:14.991 --> 13:16.825
Um... These people
are professionals.

13:16.826 --> 13:18.260
They are trained.

13:18.261 --> 13:19.994
Can you hang bricks
from your nipples?

13:20.029 --> 13:21.962
I... I-I don't think I can.

13:21.998 --> 13:23.230
You would know.

13:23.266 --> 13:24.666
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

13:24.667 --> 13:26.101
You know what, you're hired.

13:26.102 --> 13:27.502
Wait, that's...
that's great.

13:27.503 --> 13:28.870
You go on in ten minutes.

13:28.871 --> 13:31.238
Get the hair dryer!
We need a blowout!

13:31.274 --> 13:33.574
<i> Dad lived out the rest
of his life as a freak.</i>

13:33.609 --> 13:35.210
<i>Mom developed an allergy
and left him</i>

13:35.211 --> 13:36.645
<i>and became a nun,
'cause she thought</i>

13:36.646 --> 13:38.280
<i>it would be like</i> Sister Act.

13:38.281 --> 13:40.114
<i>It wasn't,
and they kicked her out.</i>

13:40.149 --> 13:41.415
<i>Now she's in jail. The end.</i>

13:41.451 --> 13:42.717
Mm.

13:42.718 --> 13:44.352
So I have even less
dignity in that story.

13:44.353 --> 13:46.188
So that's the one
we'll accept as true.

13:46.189 --> 13:47.622
That's what would have happened.

13:47.623 --> 13:49.458
Dad, great news;
There's a treatment

13:49.459 --> 13:52.260
A mustache transplant.

13:52.261 --> 13:54.663
"Let our talented doctors
take follicles

13:54.664 --> 13:56.063
"from a hairier part
of your body

13:56.098 --> 13:57.499
and surgically implant
them on your lip."

13:57.500 --> 13:58.934
I'm not doing that.

13:58.935 --> 14:00.302
But you're
the perfect candidate.

14:00.303 --> 14:01.770
You have hair everywhere!

14:01.771 --> 14:03.338
Back-stache, belly-stache.

14:03.339 --> 14:05.607
Hello? Butt-stache!
Can we just...?

14:05.608 --> 14:07.442
Let Tina have the floor finally?

14:07.443 --> 14:10.712
Yes, because I know that even if
there's no mustache that night,

14:10.713 --> 14:12.681
Mom and Dad would still
fall in love

14:12.682 --> 14:15.049
because of fate,
which is great! Remember?!

14:15.084 --> 14:16.852
This is how you throw a shrimp!

14:16.853 --> 14:18.253
Ow!
Aah!

14:22.725 --> 14:24.191
<i>Done. They're in love.</i>

14:24.227 --> 14:25.827
Everyone got that?
Everyone clear?

14:25.828 --> 14:27.662
Uh... that doesn't sound right.

14:27.663 --> 14:30.065
Yeah, Dad makes a weird
noise when he's hurt,

14:30.066 --> 14:32.067
and it's not attractive
to women or anyone.

14:32.068 --> 14:33.667
It scares cats.

14:33.703 --> 14:35.237
Huh. Yeah.

14:35.238 --> 14:38.172
Um, okay, maybe
they start out a little rocky.

14:38.207 --> 14:40.342
Hey, crazy arms, take
your crazy-arm medication!

14:40.343 --> 14:42.244
Looks like you took
too much of your medication.

14:42.245 --> 14:43.745
Call your doctor

14:43.746 --> 14:45.280
if you experience
any of these symptoms.

14:45.281 --> 14:47.749
Ugly face, dumb face,
dumb breath,

14:47.750 --> 14:49.451
donkey neck, weird legs.

14:49.452 --> 14:50.886
Weird legs?

14:50.887 --> 14:52.521
Only from the waist down.

14:52.522 --> 14:54.356
Um, now that they've gotten
all that off their chests,

14:54.357 --> 14:56.056
sparks are ready to fly.

14:56.092 --> 14:57.759
Oh, boy.

14:57.760 --> 14:59.426
I don't think this is getting
back on track, T.

14:59.462 --> 15:01.529
No, it does. Fate! Destiny!

15:01.564 --> 15:03.899
Let's get married and have three
kids and live together forever!

15:03.900 --> 15:05.232
Okay.

15:05.268 --> 15:06.768
Mm... Completely unbelievable.

15:06.769 --> 15:08.236
Yeah, I don't think so, Tina.

15:08.237 --> 15:10.170
Mm, nah, that's not
the Linda I know.

15:10.206 --> 15:12.207
Oh, my God, you're right.
Dad would have walked out,

15:12.208 --> 15:14.208
and they would have been out
of each other's lives.

15:14.210 --> 15:16.111
And then...
Huh! Huh! Wha-What? What?

15:16.112 --> 15:17.711
Huh! Huh! Huh!
<i>What?!</i>

15:17.747 --> 15:19.113
It's bad! It's bad!

15:19.148 --> 15:20.749
Maybe you're just
telling it bad?

15:20.750 --> 15:22.117
Don't you see?!

15:22.118 --> 15:24.085
If Mom and Dad
don't get together,

15:24.086 --> 15:25.453
Mom's engagement
to Hugo is never broken!

15:26.889 --> 15:28.722
Are we ready, darling?

15:28.758 --> 15:30.457
So, we're actually doing this?

15:30.493 --> 15:31.960
Of course! This isn't
the rehearsal anymore?

15:31.961 --> 15:33.761
This is the...
the thing?

15:33.796 --> 15:35.397
<i>Hugo grows
a mustache for the wedding.</i>

15:35.398 --> 15:36.965
<i>It's bushy,
and it has it going on.</i>

15:36.966 --> 15:38.400
<i>No!</i>

15:38.401 --> 15:40.502
<i>It gets worse.</i>

15:40.503 --> 15:43.438
<i>They have three children...
Mona, Dean and Charlize.</i>

15:43.439 --> 15:44.940
<i>And because
Mom never breaks up with Hugo,</i>

15:44.941 --> 15:46.408
he never suffers
the tragic heartbreak

15:46.409 --> 15:48.109
that turned him
into a health inspector.

15:48.110 --> 15:51.545
So he's happy, and he pursues
his dream of opening...

15:51.581 --> 15:53.247
<i>a restaurant.</i>

15:53.282 --> 15:55.616
Big day today.
It's a holiday weekend.

15:55.651 --> 15:57.786
All right, let's sell
some hot dogs!

15:57.787 --> 15:59.354
I got it all, baby!

15:59.355 --> 16:01.455
Uh, three kids and a mustache!
Nothing missing!

16:01.490 --> 16:04.092
Big day for another
reason, too, right, Linda?

16:04.093 --> 16:06.060
It's May 5.
5/5.

16:06.095 --> 16:07.094
Oh, yeah, your height!

16:07.129 --> 16:08.597
Yes, my height!

16:08.598 --> 16:10.965
Also, Cinco de Mayo!
Also, our anniversary!

16:11.000 --> 16:12.767
Right, we got married!

16:12.768 --> 16:15.269
I'm so happy.
No lingering regret at all!

16:15.304 --> 16:17.939
Thank you for the best
anniversary! All of you!

16:17.940 --> 16:20.407
You're my children,
and you're all wonderful.

16:20.443 --> 16:23.712
You, Mona, with your appropriate
level of interest in boys.

16:23.713 --> 16:26.147
Boys? Shrug. What else you got?

16:26.148 --> 16:27.515
And don't say horses.

16:27.516 --> 16:29.650
And Dean, my little man.

16:29.685 --> 16:31.652
If only I could pull you out
of your shell!

16:31.687 --> 16:33.688
Dad, please!
Stop paying attention to me.

16:33.689 --> 16:35.123
I can't bear the spotlight!

16:35.124 --> 16:36.457
Sorry for screaming.

16:36.492 --> 16:38.994
And little Charlize,
with your stickers

16:38.995 --> 16:41.196
and your princess dolls.
Could you be any sweeter?

16:41.197 --> 16:43.064
Well, is there anything else
I can do

16:43.065 --> 16:44.431
to help the family business?

16:44.467 --> 16:45.366
Give us a twirl!

16:45.401 --> 16:46.700
Whee!

16:46.736 --> 16:48.703
You're a monster.

16:48.704 --> 16:50.638
It's not me, don't you see?
It's what would have happened!

16:50.673 --> 16:53.008
And now your mother
and I are going downstairs

16:53.009 --> 16:55.009
to stuff the sausage. Gross.

16:55.044 --> 16:56.478
Okay, that's enough.

16:56.479 --> 16:58.679
I wish it was, Dad,
but there's more.

16:58.714 --> 17:00.215
<i>Since you never fell
in love with Mom,</i>

17:00.216 --> 17:01.650
<i>your life was different, too!</i>

17:01.651 --> 17:03.084
Hugo's Hot Dogs, here we are.

17:03.085 --> 17:04.486
You coming, partner?

17:04.487 --> 17:05.887
Yes, I'm coming, Ron!

17:05.887 --> 17:07.355
I have to.
I'm a health inspector!

17:07.356 --> 17:09.757
It's my job!

17:11.768 --> 17:13.702
Free samples! Put
your hands on a wiener!

17:13.703 --> 17:15.337
No double entendre intended!

17:15.338 --> 17:16.838
Hey, I know this building.

17:16.873 --> 17:18.574
I tried to rent it 20 years ago,

17:18.575 --> 17:20.242
but somebody got in
just ahead of me.

17:20.242 --> 17:21.944
Oh, and then didn't you go on

17:21.944 --> 17:23.579
to have a series
of failed restaurants?

17:23.579 --> 17:25.012
Yeah. Thanks, Ron.

17:25.048 --> 17:26.882
Mona, honey,
Jimmy Junior's on the phone.

17:26.883 --> 17:29.584
He wants to take you
to the new zombie movie tonight.

17:29.619 --> 17:31.754
Ugh. Jimmy Junior? Zombies?

17:31.755 --> 17:34.489
Maybe in a parallel universe.

17:34.524 --> 17:36.759
Hello, we're here
to inspect you.

17:36.760 --> 17:39.427
Whee! I'm Princess Spins-around!

17:39.462 --> 17:41.563
That doesn't sound
like a real princess.

17:41.598 --> 17:42.298
Shut up!

17:42.299 --> 17:43.998
I... Sir? Ma'am?

17:44.034 --> 17:45.467
Oh, sweetheart, please, please!

17:45.468 --> 17:46.869
I don't like him!

17:46.870 --> 17:48.704
Hey, I know you from somewhere.

17:48.705 --> 17:52.006
Ugly face, dumb face,
donkey neck, weird legs!

17:52.042 --> 17:54.442
Oh, uh, uh, crazy arms, right?
How are you?

17:54.477 --> 17:56.445
Eh. Well,
we have to check something out.

17:56.446 --> 17:58.480
There's a rumor
that you make your wieners

17:58.481 --> 18:01.550
out of actual wiener dogs.

18:01.551 --> 18:03.552
I mean,
it's obviously false, but...

18:03.553 --> 18:05.420
No, it's true.

18:05.455 --> 18:06.955
What?! Hugo!

18:06.990 --> 18:08.490
Sorry, is that not

18:08.491 --> 18:09.791
the <i> gourmet</i> way to
make wieners? Hmm.

18:09.826 --> 18:11.292
Why didn't I know about this?

18:11.328 --> 18:12.761
In my defense, the pet mortuary

18:12.762 --> 18:14.797
I get the dog meat from
is very respected!

18:14.798 --> 18:16.332
Got to go.
Bye, Mort!

18:16.333 --> 18:17.967
You don't know me!

18:17.968 --> 18:19.935
Hugo, I've been eating
a real wiener dog every day?

18:19.936 --> 18:22.404
Now I don't even know
if I can finish this one.

18:22.405 --> 18:23.806
Nope, I can.

18:23.807 --> 18:26.108
I guess this is for you.

18:26.109 --> 18:27.643
Hugo, let me talk to him.

18:27.644 --> 18:29.812
Maybe I can smooth this over.

18:29.813 --> 18:31.814
Who likes milkshakes for free?

18:31.815 --> 18:33.415
No dog in it.

18:33.416 --> 18:35.216
It's chocolate, not
chocolate lab. Ha, ha.

18:35.251 --> 18:37.919
I'm not into... puns.

18:37.954 --> 18:39.788
Oh, you got
a little chocolate mustache.

18:39.789 --> 18:42.825
Oh. No, kind of looks...
nice, actually.

18:42.826 --> 18:45.127
Ooh, I just got
the weirdest feeling inside.

18:45.128 --> 18:46.762
Could be salmonella.

18:46.763 --> 18:48.597
That's what most
weird feelings inside are.

18:48.598 --> 18:49.998
No, it's like, uh...

18:50.033 --> 18:51.967
something got
on the wrong track...

18:51.968 --> 18:53.635
a long time ago.

18:53.670 --> 18:55.503
It could also be diarrhea.

18:55.538 --> 18:57.172
Hmm.
Come on, Ron.

18:57.173 --> 18:58.806
Let's blow this hot dog stand.

18:58.842 --> 19:00.275
I get it.

19:00.276 --> 19:01.710
Bye, Mr. Health Inspectors!

19:01.711 --> 19:03.278
I admire you both. Bye.

19:03.279 --> 19:04.646
Come on, Ron!

19:04.681 --> 19:06.414
That's what would have happened.

19:06.449 --> 19:07.983
Tina, you got dark, girl.

19:07.984 --> 19:09.651
You got real dark.

19:09.686 --> 19:11.053
That was... disturbing.

19:11.054 --> 19:12.488
I need to go lie down.

19:12.489 --> 19:13.921
I kind of want a hot dog.

19:13.957 --> 19:15.357
So, that's it.

19:15.358 --> 19:16.892
There's no such thing as fate.

19:16.893 --> 19:18.926
Everything is randomness
and chaos!

19:18.962 --> 19:21.463
Uh-huh. A meteorite could crash
into our house any second!

19:21.464 --> 19:23.465
Any second.
No one is meant for anyone!

19:23.466 --> 19:25.868
Not a soul! Tina, honey,
it's okay, it's okay.

19:25.869 --> 19:27.703
Everything <i>is</i> random,

19:27.704 --> 19:30.039
but that's what
makes life so wonderful.

19:30.040 --> 19:32.541
Sometimes all the crap
in the universe lines up,

19:32.542 --> 19:34.376
like that night
I met your father.

19:34.377 --> 19:37.413
Or like the time I petted that
dog and found a Cheeto. Yeah.

19:37.414 --> 19:39.381
Everything lined up,
and it came out Belcher.

19:39.382 --> 19:40.816
How beautiful is that?

19:40.817 --> 19:42.184
I mean, look at Gene.

19:42.185 --> 19:43.652
Okay, don't look at Gene.

19:43.653 --> 19:45.421
It's because
my pants are off, isn't it?

19:45.422 --> 19:47.156
I'm getting ready to exercise,

19:47.157 --> 19:49.525
and I don't want to sweat
all over my Saturday shorts.

19:49.526 --> 19:51.760
Tina, what
your mother is saying is,

19:51.761 --> 19:54.263
maybe we weren't <i> meant</i> to be
together, but we <i> are</i> together.

19:54.264 --> 19:55.931
No, that's not
what I was saying.

19:55.932 --> 19:57.700
Well, I mean, I... what I...
I meant that in a good way.

19:57.701 --> 19:59.334
Bob. Yeah. Wait. I get it.

19:59.335 --> 20:01.236
It was random fate
that brought you together.

20:01.237 --> 20:03.706
Fate is real.
It's just really random. No.

20:03.707 --> 20:05.607
It makes perfect sense.
I feel so much better.

20:05.608 --> 20:07.542
Okay, then, that's what it is.
Great talk, everybody.

20:07.577 --> 20:09.912
Ow! This seat hurts
my private parts!

20:09.913 --> 20:12.013
Ah, who am I kidding?
They're not that private.

20:12.048 --> 20:13.716
Wait. Oh, my God, that's it!

20:13.717 --> 20:15.584
What? What is? The bike!
Testicular failure!

20:15.585 --> 20:18.353
I've been giving it to myself
by riding the bike so much!

20:18.354 --> 20:19.755
It's been squeezing
your tchotchkes,

20:19.756 --> 20:21.724
and you didn't notice that?

20:21.725 --> 20:23.991
I guess I didn't notice it over
how much everything else hurt.

20:24.027 --> 20:26.361
But the results are
fantastic. Look at you!

20:26.362 --> 20:28.297
I bet
if I stop riding that thing,

20:28.298 --> 20:29.898
my mustache will grow back!

20:29.899 --> 20:32.201
Yeah, or you keep riding
and get the butt-stache surgery.

20:32.202 --> 20:34.970
Both great options.
Maybe put it to a vote? No.

20:34.971 --> 20:37.940
Maybe vote on whether to vote?
Well, that's fair.

20:37.941 --> 20:40.576
All in favor of voting in
favor for the butt-stache?

20:40.577 --> 20:42.444
All opposed to <i> no</i> butt-stache?

20:42.445 --> 20:45.481
Interesting. Oh, my God.
I'm moving out.

20:47.217 --> 20:50.986
Hugo, did you ever feel
we were... meant to be together?

20:50.987 --> 20:53.589
