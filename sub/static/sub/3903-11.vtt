00:24.816 --> 00:27.316
Wake up, Baltimore. It's 6:00 a.m....

00:27.417 --> 00:28.616
Police!

00:43.118 --> 00:44.218
Ready?

00:45.617 --> 00:47.018
Freeze, FBl!

00:50.718 --> 00:52.819
-All clear.
-Check upstairs.

00:55.119 --> 00:56.719
Turn around.

00:57.119 --> 00:59.619
Put your hands up. Behind your neck.

01:01.019 --> 01:02.619
Keep them there.

01:20.221 --> 01:22.321
No, nothing here. All clear.

01:55.224 --> 01:56.424
All clear.

02:06.825 --> 02:09.725
You won't find a goddamn thing!
I can tell you that right now.

02:09.824 --> 02:11.625
Ain't got shit on me.

02:15.125 --> 02:18.225
Fuck! You ain't got nothing.
I'm telling you. Nothing!

02:25.226 --> 02:26.726
Move, shitbird.

02:39.028 --> 02:40.928
FBl, show me your hands!

02:48.929 --> 02:50.829
Get down, fuck! Get down!

03:05.230 --> 03:06.230
Nice.

03:20.331 --> 03:21.431
Bingo.

03:25.331 --> 03:29.231
-From behind your clothes washer.
-That's heroin, 300 gelcaps.

03:38.733 --> 03:40.633
And on today's Chip Franklin Show
at noon...

03:40.733 --> 03:44.233
Chip will be live at Arundel Mills Mall
asking local retailers:

03:44.333 --> 03:46.634
"What do you get
for the guy who has everything?"

03:46.734 --> 03:48.734
Now here's Steve Stewart with sports.

03:48.833 --> 03:50.234
The Orioles continue to....

05:49.043 --> 05:52.344
-We could take him now.
-Not enough profile.

05:54.745 --> 05:56.145
Fucking feds.

05:56.745 --> 05:59.344
Be advised, target 27 is on the move.

06:11.546 --> 06:14.846
I don't get it.
Why leave Vondopoulos out on the street?

06:15.246 --> 06:18.846
The text message that told him to clean up,
it came from someone higher up.

06:18.946 --> 06:20.247
Someone we don't know.

06:20.347 --> 06:22.446
We leave him on the street
after these raids...

06:22.546 --> 06:25.047
he'll probably make contact
with whoever's above him.

06:25.147 --> 06:27.747
Either another text message or a meet.

06:28.447 --> 06:29.948
What's with George Glekas?

06:30.048 --> 06:32.847
I'm afraid he's gonna duck this warrant.

06:34.248 --> 06:37.948
-Chester Karol Sobotka?
-It's Frank Sobotka's kid.

06:38.148 --> 06:41.348
Frank's kid kills one of our targets?
Are you shitting me?

06:41.448 --> 06:42.848
Why? What for?

06:43.449 --> 06:44.949
We hit the store this morning.

06:45.049 --> 06:48.048
Every shred of paper's gone.
Just a bloodstain on the floor.

06:48.148 --> 06:51.249
So we go over to his house a half hour later
with the warrant...

06:51.349 --> 06:55.850
and it's full up with red-eyed Greek relations
looking at us like we're braindeads.

06:59.050 --> 07:00.450
Homicide, Shea.

07:00.550 --> 07:03.150
-This is Daniels, out at Southeast.
-Yes, sir.

07:03.250 --> 07:06.050
Who caught the Highlandtown murder
the night before last?

07:06.150 --> 07:07.850
Jay Landsman, sir.

07:09.850 --> 07:11.551
I'll be right over.

07:18.752 --> 07:20.952
Go get the interviews started.

07:36.453 --> 07:38.153
-Lieutenant?
-Hey, Lt.

07:46.954 --> 07:49.055
What the fuck is that about?

07:50.354 --> 07:52.355
How did we do this morning?

07:52.555 --> 07:55.454
Eton and Sergei are in. So is the madam.

07:55.654 --> 07:57.455
Glekas, I'm not sure.

07:59.355 --> 08:03.155
-The feds are waiting on Sobotka.
-What are they waiting for?

08:03.955 --> 08:05.455
You don't wanna know.

08:05.755 --> 08:06.056
Jesus, Larry....

08:06.056 --> 08:07.055
Jesus, Larry....

08:07.155 --> 08:10.656
The thing is, I think we gotta reach out
to a criminal lawyer real quick.

08:10.756 --> 08:12.856
If the union guys can't handle this mess...

08:12.956 --> 08:14.856
he's gonna have a bail hearing tomorrow.

08:14.956 --> 08:17.556
-Do you have any details?
-I don't know nothing...

08:17.657 --> 08:20.257
except he's locked up for it.
I can't see him till 10:00.

08:20.357 --> 08:23.157
-That's the only time?
-Visiting hours, yeah.

08:23.257 --> 08:25.257
Look, everything's gonna be fine.

08:35.758 --> 08:38.758
-FBl! All of you move, now!
-What the fuck is this?

08:39.558 --> 08:41.759
-FBl, move!
-Against the wall.

08:44.358 --> 08:45.959
He's here.

08:49.960 --> 08:52.259
Got another problem here, Larry.

09:02.660 --> 09:04.460
Big man on the docks.

09:05.961 --> 09:08.361
You don't look so big now, do you?

09:50.965 --> 09:51.964
Ma.

10:14.267 --> 10:15.266
Pop.

10:29.868 --> 10:31.168
It's gone.

10:32.469 --> 10:34.169
And the money, too.

10:36.069 --> 10:38.169
They say you need to come in.

10:38.569 --> 10:42.169
They said the warrant
is at Southeastern police district.

10:48.170 --> 10:50.070
They're out there now.

10:51.770 --> 10:53.370
Showtime, Franky.

11:05.971 --> 11:07.972
-Frank.
-Sir, any comment?

11:08.671 --> 11:10.771
Is it just you, or is it the whole union?

11:10.871 --> 11:14.171
What's your comment
on the charges being brought against you?

11:15.472 --> 11:18.872
Sir, do you have anything at all to say?
Any comment at all?

11:18.972 --> 11:21.773
How will you answer
the charges against you?

11:23.473 --> 11:27.073
Let me ask you, who exactly am I working
all these dead girls for?

11:27.173 --> 11:28.573
The Homicide unit, right?

11:28.673 --> 11:32.573
The same Homicide unit that can't put
two and two together and pick up a phone...

11:32.673 --> 11:36.373
Ieaving me to read it a day-and-a-half later
in The Baltimore Sun.

11:42.174 --> 11:46.574
-What did you take from the scene?
-Photos, latents, spent casings.

11:50.075 --> 11:51.075
Fuck.

11:51.475 --> 11:53.675
They cleaned everything else?

11:55.475 --> 11:58.476
Even for a supremely
fucked-up police department...

11:58.576 --> 12:00.376
this takes the prize.

12:07.676 --> 12:09.576
How'd the kid play it?

12:09.676 --> 12:11.276
He signed a full statement.

12:11.376 --> 12:14.777
He said that there was an argument
about a stolen car or two.

12:14.877 --> 12:16.777
Think he'll open up and talk more?

12:16.978 --> 12:18.978
He's been processed and assigned a PD.

12:19.077 --> 12:23.377
If you want to take a run at the kid,
you're gonna have to get around his lawyer.

12:24.977 --> 12:28.278
I'm sorry, Lieutenant. It's my bad.

12:33.778 --> 12:36.579
State your name, asshole.
What's your name?

12:37.979 --> 12:39.579
What's your name?

12:50.280 --> 12:51.780
State your name.

12:53.980 --> 12:56.880
Come on, you know this part.
Give us a name.

13:01.381 --> 13:03.081
There is your name.

13:05.381 --> 13:06.981
State your name.

13:10.882 --> 13:12.082
No name?

13:13.782 --> 13:16.882
-For now, we'll just call you Boris.
-Boris.

13:18.982 --> 13:20.682
Why always "Boris"?

13:21.583 --> 13:25.483
Racketeering. Wire fraud.
Conspiracy to import heroin.

13:25.583 --> 13:28.683
Conspiracy to violate
federal customs statutes.

13:28.783 --> 13:30.283
White slavery.

13:31.584 --> 13:35.384
Today we're only charging
the customs violations, Mr. Sobotka.

13:35.983 --> 13:39.884
But eventually, a grand jury indictment
will expose you to a lot more.

13:39.884 --> 13:40.284
But eventually, a grand jury indictment
will expose you to a lot more.

13:42.684 --> 13:46.985
Name names, and come clean.
You help yourself and your union.

13:47.884 --> 13:49.385
Help my union?

13:52.785 --> 13:55.685
For 25 years,
we've been dying slow down there.

13:57.086 --> 13:59.986
Dry docks rusting, piers standing empty.

14:01.487 --> 14:04.186
My friends and their kids,
like we got the cancer.

14:04.286 --> 14:07.986
No lifeline got thrown all that time.
Nothing from nobody.

14:09.486 --> 14:11.486
And now you wanna help us?

14:12.587 --> 14:13.787
Help me?

14:20.188 --> 14:22.788
-What's your full name?
-Michael McArdle.

14:22.888 --> 14:24.588
-White Mike.
-Yeah, that's right.

14:24.688 --> 14:25.988
Listen to this, Mikey.

14:26.088 --> 14:27.688
I wanna know it wasn't your people...

14:27.788 --> 14:29.988
dropped that body on Potee Street
the other night.

14:30.088 --> 14:32.589
I'm asking 'cause it was someone
with a Greek-ass name...

14:32.789 --> 14:35.489
and fuck if he wasn't dumped
in front of a house I was using.

14:35.589 --> 14:38.089
Did he have hands? Did he have a face?

14:38.189 --> 14:40.089
Yes? Then it wasn't us.

14:43.189 --> 14:44.889
We hit your suppliers.

14:44.989 --> 14:47.190
They cleaned up
and left you holding the dirt.

14:47.290 --> 14:50.290
-Suppliers of what?
-You discussed a drug buy on this tape.

14:50.391 --> 14:53.190
We also have photographs
tying you to your stash house...

14:53.290 --> 14:57.291
and putting you at The Greek's warehouse
over on Newkirk Street for re-ups.

14:58.891 --> 15:01.191
Do yourself a solid here, Mike.

15:13.492 --> 15:16.392
-What's the plan?
-This is just a detention hearing, Frank.

15:16.492 --> 15:19.193
You're not a flight risk,
you have no meaningful priors.

15:19.293 --> 15:21.693
And so far they've only hit you
with one count.

15:21.793 --> 15:24.693
The magistrate's gonna ask us
some basic questions.

15:24.793 --> 15:27.293
Barring anything unforeseen,
you're out in an hour.

15:27.393 --> 15:29.994
-I said nothing to them suits.
-All the better.

15:31.394 --> 15:34.894
-This Eton, he's in charge of what exactly?
-The dope.

15:35.794 --> 15:37.394
He's what, Greek?

15:37.595 --> 15:40.895
He's a Jew.
You know, from that Jew country they got.

15:40.995 --> 15:45.195
-And what about the guy they call Sergei?
-Sergei's straight muscle.

15:45.995 --> 15:49.496
-Look, I need something to eat.
-Okay, what do you want?

15:50.095 --> 15:52.595
Two hot dogs and a strawberry soda.

15:53.596 --> 15:55.496
I'd fuck the order up.

15:57.696 --> 15:59.697
It's gotta be strawberry?

16:00.196 --> 16:01.597
Hook a brother up.

16:09.397 --> 16:12.297
Big man, that ain't gonna work for Omar.

16:13.897 --> 16:15.398
It's all right.

16:21.098 --> 16:22.698
Been what, a year?

16:24.198 --> 16:27.199
Boy, you don't know,
I been dreaming of running into you again.

16:27.299 --> 16:29.899
You got a focus. I give you that.

16:30.099 --> 16:32.999
Man be like that when he got work to do.
You know what I mean?

16:33.099 --> 16:34.699
I think you've done enough.

16:34.799 --> 16:37.699
Bird gone.
Wee-Bey copped out to all them murders.

16:37.799 --> 16:40.200
He in jail now forever and a day.

16:40.400 --> 16:44.500
Stinkum? I mean, you closed the book
on that nigger your damn self.

16:44.600 --> 16:48.301
Avon, he out of pocket for the time being.

16:49.100 --> 16:50.401
Leaving you.

16:50.501 --> 16:54.001
-You looking for closure?
-Lookit, man, ain't no closure.

16:55.000 --> 16:59.001
Not unless Brandon walk up out his grave
and come up in this room right now.

16:59.101 --> 17:02.801
See, all I know is whoever did him that way,
they gets got.

17:03.502 --> 17:07.102
Whoever did him that way,
they still out there right now.

17:07.301 --> 17:09.902
So now you gonna play like
you had nothing to do with it.

17:10.002 --> 17:11.502
No, I can't lie.

17:11.602 --> 17:16.002
I put the motherfucking paper out on y'all.
But y'all was fucking with my stash.

17:16.303 --> 17:18.903
Anything after that, part of the game.

17:19.203 --> 17:22.404
Maybe. But see,
I went past that with Brandon.

17:23.804 --> 17:26.603
That wasn't me. That wasn't Avon, either.

17:27.002 --> 17:31.404
Bird and them were there to see it.
But another man did all the extras:

17:32.704 --> 17:34.704
all that cigarette shit...

17:35.404 --> 17:37.405
all that bullshit with the eyes.

17:37.505 --> 17:40.905
See now, this man,
he building a rep for himself...

17:41.305 --> 17:43.105
and he wants you bad.

17:43.405 --> 17:46.505
The brutal shit, that's his calling card.

17:47.806 --> 17:50.806
Little bow-tie wearing motherfucker
from out of....

17:50.906 --> 17:51.906
NYC?

17:52.706 --> 17:54.306
Yeah, small dude.

17:57.106 --> 17:58.606
What he go by?

18:00.106 --> 18:01.607
Brother Mouzone.

18:04.006 --> 18:06.307
I know you heard of him, right?

18:07.708 --> 18:09.907
So if y'all got the mind to go after him...

18:10.007 --> 18:13.108
I might be able to point you
in that direction.

18:13.608 --> 18:14.608
Why?

18:15.508 --> 18:18.008
What happened to your boy was business.

18:18.408 --> 18:22.308
But how that shit happened,
you got the right to take that to heart.

18:22.408 --> 18:24.609
I figure that'll make us even.

18:25.209 --> 18:27.909
Now, you wanna know where this nigger is?

18:30.709 --> 18:33.909
-We need to sit down and talk, Frank.
-I gotta see my son.

18:34.009 --> 18:36.710
The man's right.
Let's grab a cup of coffee or something.

18:36.810 --> 18:39.010
Not now, I need to get clean.

18:41.810 --> 18:43.410
Sergei and them...

18:45.710 --> 18:47.410
they did Mau Mau Willis.

18:47.510 --> 18:50.411
-Why'd they chill him?
-He was welshing on the Jew.

18:50.511 --> 18:54.812
Okay, Sergei's a soldier.
But he and Eton report to somebody.

18:55.511 --> 18:58.412
-Who's above those two, Mike?
-I don't know.

19:00.512 --> 19:03.011
-You don't know?
-Never did wanna know.

19:14.713 --> 19:17.513
God in heaven, Zig,
the cops do that to you?

19:19.113 --> 19:20.514
Ain't the cops.

19:31.414 --> 19:34.315
Lawyers are saying the bail might be tough.

19:35.815 --> 19:37.215
I'm trying.

19:38.615 --> 19:40.715
You know I'm trying, right?

19:43.315 --> 19:46.016
-What happened?
-I don't know.

19:47.916 --> 19:49.316
I got tired.

19:52.716 --> 19:55.917
I got tired of being the punchline
to every joke.

20:01.217 --> 20:03.818
You had problems,
you could've come to me.

20:04.018 --> 20:06.117
You could've said something.

20:07.418 --> 20:09.318
You wouldn't have heard.

20:10.618 --> 20:13.618
You were always too busy
dredging up the canal.

20:15.018 --> 20:17.619
Making sure the right bum got elected.

20:18.618 --> 20:21.119
Buying another round for the house.

20:27.219 --> 20:31.420
I always used to think you were working
all them hours you spent away.

20:31.919 --> 20:35.420
It was all work, Zig, even when it wasn't.

20:36.520 --> 20:38.720
For you, for your mother.

20:40.120 --> 20:43.121
I bet you didn't even tell her
I was in here, did you?

20:43.720 --> 20:45.221
Maybe you did...

20:45.520 --> 20:49.521
and she already took three Nembutals,
sleeping the day away.

20:50.421 --> 20:54.021
-Leave her out of this.
-She's out of it, don't worry.

20:59.122 --> 21:00.122
Pop...

21:03.722 --> 21:06.823
when I seen what I did
to that kid down at the store...

21:06.923 --> 21:09.122
it made me sick to my stomach.

21:11.523 --> 21:13.923
-That ain't you, Zig.
-It ain't?

21:15.923 --> 21:19.123
Because the same blood
don't flow for us, Pop.

21:19.223 --> 21:21.824
I mean, I wish it did, but it don't.

21:23.124 --> 21:25.524
You're more like me than you know.

21:29.524 --> 21:31.124
You're a Sobotka.

21:36.225 --> 21:38.725
Fucked is what I am.

21:53.427 --> 21:55.227
What the fuck can I say?

22:20.829 --> 22:23.730
Best progress so far
is "White Mike" McArdle.

22:23.830 --> 22:25.530
He's standing on the edge of the cliff.

22:25.630 --> 22:29.630
We're gonna get Pearlman in today
to see what she can do to step him off.

22:29.730 --> 22:32.630
Also, we're still hunting
the Sobotka nephew.

22:32.830 --> 22:34.430
Herc and Carver are on that.

22:34.530 --> 22:37.431
Still, my guess is the drug players...

22:38.630 --> 22:41.531
even if they roll, give us Eton and Sergei.

22:42.331 --> 22:45.231
The case gets thin when we get up to this...

22:47.031 --> 22:48.631
Spiros Vondopoulos.

22:48.731 --> 22:51.132
Boy, them Greeks
and those twisted-ass names.

22:51.232 --> 22:53.631
Lay off the Greeks.
They invented civilization.

22:53.731 --> 22:55.531
Yeah? Ass-fucking, too.

22:55.932 --> 22:58.432
What exactly do we know
about Vondopoulos?

22:58.532 --> 23:01.432
We should stay on him, see who he really is.

23:01.632 --> 23:03.033
How about it?

23:03.333 --> 23:06.533
Throw us a few
of your well-equipped surveillance teams?

23:06.933 --> 23:10.533
In case you haven't noticed, Lieutenant,
I'm the only fed still in the room.

23:10.633 --> 23:13.433
The US attorney has what he wants
with the union guys...

23:13.533 --> 23:17.134
which means my field office
is pretty much over this case.

23:17.333 --> 23:20.134
Okay, we're on Vondopoulos ourselves.

23:24.535 --> 23:26.235
I'm sorry for him...

23:27.434 --> 23:28.835
and for you.

23:30.635 --> 23:33.535
We should've paid more attention
to our own.

23:33.835 --> 23:37.035
Like I could've stopped Ziggy
from what he'd done.

23:37.635 --> 23:39.736
Like anyone could ever control him.

23:39.836 --> 23:42.036
I was thinking of my boy, too.

23:44.637 --> 23:46.736
They're dropping the net on all the guys.

23:46.836 --> 23:49.737
Ain't no secret
things get lost in them cans now and again.

23:49.837 --> 23:51.537
He'll be all right.

23:52.137 --> 23:54.337
They tossed my house, Frank.

23:55.037 --> 23:58.637
They don't do that when there's
a couple of cases of vodka missing.

24:00.837 --> 24:05.638
They made me sign the search warrant.
That's a receipt-like for what they found.

24:06.738 --> 24:09.838
Heroin, Frank. From this house.

24:10.339 --> 24:13.439
No, that ain't right. That can't be right.

24:14.838 --> 24:19.339
I knew Nicky and Zig was boosting stuff.
Cameras, shit like that. Nothing like this.

24:19.439 --> 24:20.639
You knew?

24:22.439 --> 24:25.940
And once Nicky got used to boosting stuff
and seeing a little money...

24:26.040 --> 24:30.340
what did you think he was gonna do?
Turn straight all of a sudden and give it up?

24:30.640 --> 24:32.140
No, Frank.

24:32.840 --> 24:36.040
Once you gave him
a taste on the house, just....

24:36.540 --> 24:40.341
That was never.... I mean, he knew. He knew.

24:40.941 --> 24:43.141
Everything I did, the cans I let through...

24:43.241 --> 24:45.841
the money we got from that
went to keeping what we had.

24:45.941 --> 24:47.642
God damn it, Frank!

24:49.442 --> 24:52.942
Don't let that excuse this. Not this.

24:56.642 --> 24:59.243
Uncle Frank, with the big shoulders.

25:00.042 --> 25:02.543
"If it's broke, give it to my uncle.

25:03.543 --> 25:05.143
"He can fix it."

25:30.245 --> 25:33.245
Hey, Killer.
I got something for you, come here.

25:49.046 --> 25:51.247
You got the new Harper's yet?

25:52.947 --> 25:54.847
Now, you know stores down the way...

25:54.947 --> 25:57.848
don't have nothing past Vibe
and Handguns Today.

25:58.248 --> 26:00.648
Some titty mags, too, if you need.

26:00.847 --> 26:02.948
All right. I got you.

26:03.348 --> 26:06.048
I'm gonna hook you up, though, all right?

26:10.848 --> 26:13.749
Hey, boy. Told you I had something for you.

26:13.949 --> 26:15.449
There you go.

26:16.249 --> 26:17.949
That's my good boy.

27:08.854 --> 27:10.554
Good day for a ship.

27:11.254 --> 27:14.754
This is the hiring hall, Frank.
Working stevedores only.

27:18.955 --> 27:21.255
Big Roy, let me have your card.

27:23.255 --> 27:24.755
What do you want my card for?

27:24.855 --> 27:27.555
Not you. Little Big Roy,
let me hold your card.

27:27.855 --> 27:30.756
I need it.
I'm gonna work the Cape St. George today.

27:30.856 --> 27:33.455
-I'll work it for you.
-Work it for me?

27:33.655 --> 27:37.256
I work the ship on your card.
You work a barstool down Clement Street.

27:37.356 --> 27:39.556
End of the week, you get paid.

27:54.658 --> 27:55.958
Hey, Phil.

27:58.058 --> 28:00.558
I'm putting up for the Cape St. George.

28:00.658 --> 28:02.759
I don't see no resemblance.

28:02.958 --> 28:07.258
We're both bald, we're both Polacks.
What the fuck else you need to know?

28:28.061 --> 28:29.961
Who's gonna work for me?

28:31.761 --> 28:35.161
-A different look for our boy.
-Perry Ellis or something.

28:35.461 --> 28:39.561
How would a just-rolled-out-of-bed-looking
motherfucker like you...

28:39.662 --> 28:41.362
know the designer?

28:43.362 --> 28:45.062
Okay, I'm guessing.

28:46.962 --> 28:48.762
It's a Joseph Abboud.

28:49.562 --> 28:52.462
He puts dark buttons instead of brass
on his blazers.

28:52.562 --> 28:54.462
That's the Abboud signature.

28:54.562 --> 28:59.363
You know what they call a guy who pays
that much attention to his clothes, right?

28:59.563 --> 29:00.863
A grown-up.

29:02.863 --> 29:04.163
We're up.

29:05.364 --> 29:08.264
-12-14, let's go.
-Copy, 1 1-34.

29:24.465 --> 29:26.765
-That's a first.
-Sweat from a checker.

30:01.168 --> 30:03.068
-You all right?
-Ready.

30:05.168 --> 30:07.669
Maybe you ought to set up an easel
on the sidewalk...

30:07.869 --> 30:10.569
-and do a sketch instead.
-I'm fine.

30:36.072 --> 30:40.172
-Anything I ought to know?
-Yeah. Use the city.

30:41.072 --> 30:44.272
Windows, mirrors, reflections,
anything like that.

30:47.472 --> 30:49.573
Stay on my frequency, hear?

30:53.573 --> 30:56.273
Vondopoulos should be coming out
of the garage on foot...

30:56.373 --> 30:58.473
-right about now.
-Copy that.

32:00.979 --> 32:04.479
Beadie Russell. She wasn't much
when we started, you know.

32:04.579 --> 32:06.479
But now she's got game.

32:29.381 --> 32:30.682
Thank you.

33:24.786 --> 33:27.887
1 2-14. I got him going into
a fifth floor room.

33:28.086 --> 33:30.286
Note the number
then get down to the lobby.

33:30.386 --> 33:33.087
-Wait on him there.
-Copy.

33:48.388 --> 33:51.688
She's got Vondopoulos in a room.
It could be a while.

33:52.288 --> 33:53.389
Copy.

34:04.589 --> 34:07.589
-All this shit's going out to chassis?
-That's what they tell me.

34:07.689 --> 34:10.590
We need a forklift. We're almost done here.

34:26.591 --> 34:30.091
12-14. Vondopoulos and another man,
middle-aged, blue suit...

34:30.192 --> 34:33.692
Ieaving the front door of the hotel.
They'rejust behind me. Copy?

34:33.792 --> 34:34.792
Copy.

34:36.391 --> 34:37.592
1 1-34.

34:37.692 --> 34:41.692
Subject and companion, blue suit,
leaving the hotel any moment now.

34:41.792 --> 34:43.793
Copy, we got the eyeball.

34:51.393 --> 34:54.094
The man with Vondopoulos
has got to be big.

34:54.793 --> 34:58.693
-I mean, look at that expensive suit.
-Yeah, with them buttons and all.

35:16.995 --> 35:18.795
We leave the Benz here?

35:20.595 --> 35:21.796
It's hot.

35:38.297 --> 35:41.298
They didn't come back to the Benz.
You got them down there?

35:41.398 --> 35:42.597
Negative.

36:35.302 --> 36:38.503
-You about done?
-These nine here still got to be stripped.

36:38.603 --> 36:41.003
-Harder than it looks.
-What ain't?

36:43.403 --> 36:47.203
-You hear how Moonshot got his name?
-Yeah, and I could give a fuck.

36:49.703 --> 36:51.703
Who was the room registered to?

36:52.204 --> 36:56.004
Stephen Rados.
He gave a Northwest D.C. address.

36:56.204 --> 36:59.504
Maybe that's the man with the good tailor.
Maybe not.

36:59.604 --> 37:03.204
We should run out the paper trail
on this guy, see what we turn up.

37:04.005 --> 37:07.505
As to our only tangible piece of progress
from the raids...

37:07.605 --> 37:10.306
what can we do for our friend White Mike?

37:10.705 --> 37:14.306
He rolls on his suppliers,
and he can walk with a long probation.

37:14.406 --> 37:17.906
-And we can move him, if he needs.
-Witness protection?

37:18.605 --> 37:22.606
Why have the feds with you if they're
not gonna step up every now and then?

37:23.206 --> 37:26.606
Wait a second. You're gonna give
a drug dealer a ride like that?

37:26.706 --> 37:28.207
What about Frank Sobotka?

37:28.307 --> 37:30.707
The feds took a shot at him and got nothing.

37:30.807 --> 37:32.208
Or so they tell me.

37:32.307 --> 37:35.307
The way I read it, they cared more
about busting up the union--

37:35.407 --> 37:39.108
Than anything else in the case.
If we came at Frank straight?

37:40.507 --> 37:43.308
You can't make him
any kind of specific offer yourself.

37:43.408 --> 37:46.908
Only I can do that, and only after
I get an okay from my front office.

37:47.008 --> 37:50.608
-She could plant the seed.
-There's no better messenger, Counselor.

37:53.309 --> 37:54.609
Take a shot.

37:55.609 --> 37:59.109
-You going to his house?
-The Union Hall. That's his house.

38:01.010 --> 38:03.110
Thanks for waiting, Brucie. Sorry I'm late.

38:03.210 --> 38:05.310
I shouldn't even be seen with you
at this point.

38:05.410 --> 38:07.711
I just wanna settle our business
while we still can.

38:07.810 --> 38:10.910
It ain't like I'm gonna get my hands
on more cash, obviously.

38:11.011 --> 38:12.911
The grain pier is dead.

38:14.611 --> 38:18.011
Half the votes we had lined up
are walking sideways now.

38:18.111 --> 38:19.611
They read the paper, Frank.

38:19.711 --> 38:23.711
So what? So I'm dirty.
The grain pier's still the grain pier, right?

38:23.811 --> 38:26.312
They ain't voting for me, Brucie!
It ain't about me!

38:26.412 --> 38:27.511
I'm not gonna lie.

38:27.711 --> 38:31.213
No one is gonna stand with us
now that the FBI is on you.

38:31.313 --> 38:33.512
-They're scared.
-Of what?

38:33.912 --> 38:35.612
They took the money, Frank.

38:35.712 --> 38:39.713
And now if they deliver the votes,
they figure the feds will be on them, too.

38:39.813 --> 38:41.413
I'm sorry, Frank.

38:41.913 --> 38:44.513
You find a way
of putting this FBI thing to bed...

38:44.613 --> 38:47.313
maybe we can come back the next session
with the grain pier.

38:47.413 --> 38:51.614
You'll have a couple of people down there
knowing they owe you a vote or two.

38:53.014 --> 38:56.715
I don't know what else to say. I don't.
I'm sorry, Frank.

39:00.115 --> 39:02.615
You know what the trouble is, Brucie?

39:06.115 --> 39:09.215
We used to make shit in this country.
Build shit.

39:11.415 --> 39:14.616
Now we just put our hand
in the next guy's pocket.

39:35.418 --> 39:39.718
Come on, you can't eat only olives.
Order something. Lamb or something.

39:40.118 --> 39:41.618
I'm not hungry.

39:46.219 --> 39:47.519
All this trouble.

39:51.719 --> 39:55.219
-So, our associates, they are strong?
-Yes.

39:55.520 --> 39:59.120
I don't worry about our people.
We can try to get them out before the trial.

39:59.220 --> 40:01.320
If not, they will stand for us.

40:02.420 --> 40:06.320
We have shown them too much.
There will be no more trouble.

40:07.220 --> 40:09.421
We must make certain of this.

40:10.120 --> 40:13.621
-Maybe there's another way.
-There is only one sure way.

40:13.920 --> 40:15.021
Hear me out.

40:15.121 --> 40:18.721
If I could guarantee
that Frank Sobotka and his nephew...

40:18.821 --> 40:20.521
would be silent...

40:21.422 --> 40:23.422
wouldn't you prefer that?

40:24.122 --> 40:25.922
But you cannot guarantee this.

40:26.022 --> 40:29.423
Frank's son,
the idiot who shot George in his store...

40:30.422 --> 40:32.923
he is going to jail for a long time...

40:33.722 --> 40:35.023
unless....

40:38.023 --> 40:41.424
There was a young clerk wounded that day
in the store.

40:42.223 --> 40:45.124
The prosecutors want to use him
as a witness.

40:45.324 --> 40:46.924
I know his family.

40:48.124 --> 40:50.724
Frank Sobotka will have his son back.

40:51.424 --> 40:54.925
If a man can have this,
why would he talk to the police?

40:55.324 --> 40:57.224
What about Frank's nephew?

40:57.324 --> 41:00.625
He is the idiot's cousin.
He wants the same thing as Frank.

41:00.725 --> 41:03.825
Anyway, I don't worry about Niko.

41:07.225 --> 41:09.325
You are fond of him, Spiros.

41:10.326 --> 41:12.226
You should've had a son.

41:12.926 --> 41:15.226
But then I would've had a wife.

41:26.027 --> 41:30.028
If this maggot doesn't post by midnight,
I'm gonna take it personal.

41:33.928 --> 41:36.628
The shitbird lives in his parents' basement.

41:39.828 --> 41:42.229
Where's a guy like that gonna run?

42:22.332 --> 42:24.932
You wanna go with Auntie Tasha? Come on.

42:27.433 --> 42:28.933
Nice and easy, honey.

42:29.033 --> 42:31.733
-Come here.
-All right, come on, baby.

42:32.032 --> 42:34.833
What's up, big man? Where the party at?

42:35.133 --> 42:37.033
Ain't no party up in here, girl.

42:37.133 --> 42:41.134
We thought Darnell and everybody
was gonna get their smoke on.

42:41.434 --> 42:43.334
Don't you know Darnell?

42:43.733 --> 42:45.834
What's this good boy's name?

42:46.234 --> 42:47.435
Hey, boy.

42:48.234 --> 42:49.834
How you doing today?

42:49.934 --> 42:52.134
You been good? This a good boy.

42:53.035 --> 42:56.235
-There it is.
-Car will be running.

43:01.335 --> 43:02.936
What is it, Lamar?

43:11.236 --> 43:13.236
No need to prolong this.

43:14.136 --> 43:15.636
No, we got time.

43:16.037 --> 43:18.737
-You kill my man?
-No, he's resting.

43:22.637 --> 43:26.838
-I'm saying, ain't you wanna know?
-Not particularly.

43:28.038 --> 43:31.137
About a year ago, a boy name Brandon got
got here in Baltimore.

43:31.238 --> 43:33.638
Stuck and burned before he passed.

43:34.338 --> 43:37.338
-The game is the game.
-Indeed.

43:38.339 --> 43:40.139
See, that boy was beautiful.

43:40.339 --> 43:42.838
Wasn't no need for y'all to do him
the way y'all did.

43:42.938 --> 43:44.339
You feel me?

43:44.539 --> 43:46.939
-A year, you say?
-About that.

43:50.040 --> 43:52.540
You've got some wrong information.

43:53.039 --> 43:54.940
Man, you lying to live.

43:55.740 --> 43:57.740
I'm at peace with my God.

43:58.940 --> 44:00.540
Do what you will.

44:18.642 --> 44:20.042
So you know?

44:21.042 --> 44:24.342
What happened to your boy,
it's not my style.

44:30.543 --> 44:34.943
The way you bleeding out your back,
looks like that bullet bore clean through.

44:36.543 --> 44:38.944
9 mm at close range will do that.

44:49.245 --> 44:51.445
Emergency. Do you need police
or ambulance?

44:51.545 --> 44:54.345
I wanna report a shooting
over here at the new motel.

44:54.445 --> 44:57.745
-On North Avenue. Room 221 .
-Sir?

45:31.648 --> 45:33.248
My pal, Beatrice.

45:34.549 --> 45:38.349
What, you gonna run me in again?
lsn't that like double jeopardy or some shit?

45:38.449 --> 45:40.249
Stop it, just stop it.

45:43.449 --> 45:45.749
-Talk to me.
-And say what?

45:51.150 --> 45:53.650
I'm sitting here trying to figure it out myself.

45:53.750 --> 45:55.850
It didn't happen overnight.

46:06.151 --> 46:07.851
I knew I was wrong.

46:09.652 --> 46:13.052
But in my head, I thought I was wrong
for the right reasons, you know?

46:13.152 --> 46:15.652
There are different kinds of wrong.

46:19.252 --> 46:21.352
What're you doing here, Bea?

46:23.253 --> 46:26.653
I'd like you to come in. Not in cuffs.

46:28.053 --> 46:30.054
Because you want to.

46:31.554 --> 46:33.754
I'm opening a door here, Frank.

46:43.154 --> 46:45.355
I can't promise you anything.

46:47.055 --> 46:49.655
Just come in. We'll start from there.

46:55.456 --> 46:58.355
You're better than them you got in bed with.

47:08.356 --> 47:12.057
-Our man Vondopoulos didn't come home?
-Maybe he got lucky.

47:15.357 --> 47:16.957
Maybe we didn't.

47:18.657 --> 47:22.358
You think he ditched the Benz
because he picked up the tail?

47:30.759 --> 47:32.959
Nicky from the docks.

47:36.659 --> 47:39.459
If you hadn't called last night,
I'd have never found you.

47:39.559 --> 47:41.359
Relax, Niko, come on.

47:42.660 --> 47:45.059
It's like I told you on the phone.

47:45.259 --> 47:48.360
It is going to be all right.
We can make it all right.

47:48.460 --> 47:51.060
I should have never gone down the road
with you people.

47:51.160 --> 47:55.060
Come on.
You tried to make something of yourself.

47:55.260 --> 47:57.260
There's no harm in that.

47:57.661 --> 47:59.761
And you still have friends.

48:00.061 --> 48:01.461
I'm busted.

48:02.762 --> 48:06.761
So is my uncle and the whole fucking union.
And Ziggy?

48:08.362 --> 48:10.662
-Christ!
-We will be a friend to him, too.

48:10.761 --> 48:14.162
Nothing your people can do about that.
Ziggy's done.

48:15.762 --> 48:19.262
Nothing is done, Niko. Nothing.

48:21.062 --> 48:22.263
Take a look.

48:27.363 --> 48:29.163
That's not your name.

48:30.064 --> 48:32.064
Many names, many passports.

48:34.563 --> 48:36.364
We can do many things.

48:42.364 --> 48:44.364
What can you do for Ziggy?

48:48.465 --> 48:50.265
We ask only loyalty.

49:04.266 --> 49:07.966
Why do they need sticks?
Can't they kick it with their feet?

49:09.667 --> 49:12.967
She asked me straight-up to come in,
so I'm here.

49:13.468 --> 49:16.367
First, we need to know
what you're looking for.

49:16.467 --> 49:19.268
We don't want any misunderstandings
later on.

49:19.368 --> 49:23.768
I'm just looking for, you know,
some help with my son.

49:24.668 --> 49:28.468
-He can't jail where they got him.
-We move him to a county facility.

49:30.168 --> 49:33.669
-What about my nephew?
-He gets arrested and charged.

49:33.769 --> 49:36.269
But for his cooperation and yours...

49:37.170 --> 49:39.669
we can live with straight probation.

49:41.769 --> 49:44.570
But what we can and cannot do
for you and your family...

49:44.670 --> 49:48.771
-depends on the level of your cooperation.
-You mean, how much I give you?

49:50.170 --> 49:51.870
I got dirt on all of them.

49:52.671 --> 49:56.371
I'll put myself in, too. Whatever you need.
Anything but the union.

49:56.471 --> 50:00.271
I ain't putting in no union men.
I'll give you them dead girls in the can.

50:00.371 --> 50:02.672
I'll give you The Greek,
all them sons of bitches...

50:02.772 --> 50:06.072
just to have it off my chest.
Just look to my son and my nephew.

50:06.272 --> 50:08.672
Mr. Sobotka, at this point
I have to advise you...

50:08.772 --> 50:11.172
you need to retain
the services of an attorney.

50:11.272 --> 50:12.573
We're not gonna do this now?

50:12.673 --> 50:14.573
You need to have a lawyer
present in the room.

50:14.773 --> 50:18.473
You have that, we can make this happen
first thing tomorrow.

50:27.273 --> 50:29.774
Mr. Sobotka, I gotta ask.

50:30.274 --> 50:32.774
Why did you stop using your cell phone?

50:32.874 --> 50:36.574
You guys flagged it.
You think I didn't know?

52:02.382 --> 52:03.982
Under the bridge?

52:04.982 --> 52:08.783
It's out in the open.
I guess the cops can't bug it or nothing.

52:08.883 --> 52:11.282
These guys,
they got a big operation to protect.

52:11.382 --> 52:12.983
They're global-like.

52:13.082 --> 52:16.383
-They're really something?
-You got no idea.

52:16.483 --> 52:19.683
I think I got a pretty clear picture
of what they're about.

52:20.784 --> 52:25.083
We ain't talking about a bunch of thieves
rolling drums of olive oil off the docks.

52:25.183 --> 52:26.284
Heroin?

52:26.684 --> 52:29.784
How the fuck did that happen, Nick?
Look at me!

52:30.984 --> 52:33.284
You ain't much more than a kid.

52:35.384 --> 52:39.285
Me, I should've known better.
I put you up with them, for what?

52:41.685 --> 52:44.286
I flushed my fucking family, for what?

52:47.185 --> 52:49.786
You know what that is, Nicky? Do you?

52:52.486 --> 52:53.986
A condominium.

53:00.187 --> 53:01.787
I ain't going down there.

53:01.987 --> 53:05.387
What I'm gonna do is,
I'm gonna go in and talk with the police.

53:05.487 --> 53:08.887
That's right. I'm gonna do
to those cocksuckers what they did to me.

53:08.987 --> 53:11.088
-You can't do that.
-Why not?

53:12.788 --> 53:15.188
They wanna meet with us on Ziggy.

53:16.888 --> 53:18.588
They can lean on that witness...

53:18.688 --> 53:21.789
that kid that he shot,
the one that was there in the store.

53:21.889 --> 53:24.288
The kid's gonna say that
Double G had the gun.

53:24.388 --> 53:27.189
That it was like self-defense or some shit.

53:29.089 --> 53:31.290
Ziggy could walk, Uncle Frank.

53:32.189 --> 53:33.390
He could.

53:36.790 --> 53:37.990
-And for that they want what?
-Loyalty.

53:37.990 --> 53:39.390
-And for that they want what?
-Loyalty.

53:39.990 --> 53:41.391
Motherfuckers!

54:13.292 --> 54:14.993
I'll hear them out.

54:16.593 --> 54:19.393
-All right, I'll drive.
-No, it's just me.

54:20.794 --> 54:22.994
You ain't dealing with those guys no more.

54:23.093 --> 54:27.294
-Uncle Frank, me and Spiros--
-I don't fucking want you with me, Nick!

54:28.494 --> 54:29.694
Go home!

56:43.305 --> 56:44.706
Your way...

56:45.906 --> 56:47.406
it won't work.

56:48.305 --> 56:54.340
