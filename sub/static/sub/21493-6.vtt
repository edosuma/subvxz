00:06.006 --> 00:09.634
[Sam]  In 1910, Robert Falcon Scott
set out to become the first person

00:09.718 --> 00:11.720
to reach the South Pole.

00:11.803 --> 00:14.305
A year and a half later,
he arrived, only to discover

00:14.389 --> 00:17.434
that Roald Amundsen had beat him
by 34 days.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.979
And if that weren't bad enough,
on the journey home,

00:21.062 --> 00:24.816
Scott and his entire team froze to death
on the punishing tundra.

00:26.735 --> 00:28.778
You asked me what this
makes me think of?

00:28.862 --> 00:30.572
That's what it makes me think of...

00:32.032 --> 00:34.159
freezing to death under the night sky.

00:35.994 --> 00:37.829
I want you to take me to Winter Formal.

00:38.621 --> 00:40.874
-What?
-Think about how much fun

00:40.957 --> 00:43.168
we would have with all the music

00:43.251 --> 00:45.962
and dancing and wearing fancy clothes.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.048
Those are three of my least
favorite things.

00:48.131 --> 00:51.551
Oh, and raisins, because I don't like
to eat things with wrinkles.

00:52.093 --> 00:55.180
Okay, but, Sam,
this is really important to me.

00:55.263 --> 00:57.766
I've never been to a dance with a date
that wasn't a relative,

00:57.849 --> 00:59.934
and now I have a boyfriend.

01:00.018 --> 01:02.437
It's like the stars have aligned for us,
you know?

01:07.108 --> 01:08.818
I guess I could sit in the hallway

01:08.902 --> 01:11.654
outside of the gym
with my headphones on until it's over.

01:11.738 --> 01:14.532
I'll bring a Ziploc full of crackers
in case I get hungry.

01:15.658 --> 01:17.035
What? No, that's boring.

01:17.118 --> 01:19.037
Not to me. I like crackers.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.456
Did you know that
Ritz Crackers have seven holes

01:21.539 --> 01:24.042
so that they don't get
air bubbles during baking?

01:25.293 --> 01:28.254
You know, my parents are gonna be out
of town that night.

01:28.963 --> 01:31.633
So I was thinking that maybe
afterwards, you could...

01:33.218 --> 01:34.219
come over?

01:34.302 --> 01:36.888
Why would I want to go to your house?
You have terrible snacks.

01:36.971 --> 01:39.224
Plus, I'll probably be tired
and ready for bed.

01:39.307 --> 01:42.268
Come on, Sam. What do I have to do
to get you to go to the dance?

01:43.103 --> 01:46.606
If you ask them to turn the music off
so that it was silent, that would be nice.

01:47.273 --> 01:48.942
[chuckles] A dance without music.

01:50.276 --> 01:52.487
A dance without music
would be a dance without people.

01:53.404 --> 01:54.864
That sounds pretty good, too.

except I had a scratchy throat.

Okay, whatever. I...

09:28.693 --> 09:31.237
I don't know why I assumed
you would listen to me anyway.

09:31.320 --> 09:34.156
April assured me that JJ's dying
to hang out with you.

to go dress shopping for the dance.

Sam, come here.

10:10.610 --> 10:13.529
Buying condoms is inherently embarrassing.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.698
But you have nothing to be ashamed of.

10:16.365 --> 10:18.868
-You--
-Hi. I need condoms to have sex.

10:18.951 --> 10:20.995
Uh, but I like to know
what I'm purchasing.

-Can you answer some questions?
-Shoot.

10:23.122 --> 10:24.498
Can I try them on before I buy?

10:24.582 --> 10:25.499
No.

10:25.583 --> 10:28.044
-How do I put them on?
-Check the Internet?

10:28.127 --> 10:30.880
Did you know that originally condoms
were made out of leather?

10:30.963 --> 10:32.214
I did not.

10:32.298 --> 10:35.760
Can I return unused condoms
if they don't fit, or I can't have sex?

10:35.843 --> 10:37.678
Absolutely not.

10:37.762 --> 10:40.431
Some of the condoms say
"ribbed for her pleasure."

10:40.514 --> 10:43.517
Is that guaranteed?
And if not, is there a number I can call?

10:43.601 --> 10:45.478
I've never been asked that before.

10:45.561 --> 10:48.606
-Okay. Just a few more questions.
-These are the ones you want.

10:48.689 --> 10:50.107
Here you go. Just take those.

10:51.025 --> 10:53.944
All right, Sammy.
That's your ticket to ride.

10:54.028 --> 10:56.739
You, sir, are ready to take the D-Train
to Bonetown.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.659
"Each condom is electronically tested."
That's good.

11:10.294 --> 11:11.128
[knock on door]

11:13.172 --> 11:14.340
Come in.

11:15.966 --> 11:17.635
Doug. Hey.

11:17.718 --> 11:19.345
-How are you?
-Good.

11:19.428 --> 11:21.263
I wanted to return this book.

11:21.347 --> 11:22.973
-Thanks. Hope it helped.
-It did.

11:23.057 --> 11:26.602
I appreciated the conversation we had
and the book.

11:26.685 --> 11:29.855
They both helped.
You're like my personal autism school.

11:29.939 --> 11:30.898
[laughs]

11:31.440 --> 11:32.608
Well, happy to help.

11:35.569 --> 11:36.987
Was there anything else?

11:37.071 --> 11:37.988
No.

11:38.072 --> 11:40.908
Well, actually, Elsa and I,

11:40.991 --> 11:42.576
we haven't been speaking.

11:42.660 --> 11:46.997
She got upset because I didn't tell one
of my coworkers about Sam's autism.

11:47.081 --> 11:48.916
That's unfair, right?

11:48.999 --> 11:50.501
You don't want me to take sides.

11:50.584 --> 11:52.211
No. No, actually, I do.

11:52.294 --> 11:54.088
I'm right, right?

11:55.005 --> 11:56.757
You know, Doug,

11:56.841 --> 11:59.635
I love that you feel
comfortable talking to me,

11:59.718 --> 12:02.680
but lately,
it seems like you might benefit

12:02.763 --> 12:04.974
from your own relationship
with a therapist.

12:05.057 --> 12:07.893
'Cause, honestly,
the more personal information we share,

12:07.977 --> 12:10.771
the more I worry about crossing
some boundary as Sam's therapist.

12:10.855 --> 12:13.107
-I get it.
-I'm happy to give you a referral.

12:13.190 --> 12:14.650
Nah. No, thank you.

12:16.444 --> 12:17.486
Why are you limping?

12:18.195 --> 12:20.656
Oh, I hurt my foot the other day.
It's not a big deal.

12:21.323 --> 12:23.576
-Can you put your full weight on it?
-God, no.

12:23.659 --> 12:24.827
Have you seen a doctor?

12:26.495 --> 12:27.705
No.

12:27.788 --> 12:29.915
-Well, is it swollen?
-A little.

12:31.208 --> 12:32.793
Okay, a lot.

12:32.877 --> 12:34.587
All right, come on. Let's go.

12:34.670 --> 12:36.630
-What?
-I'm gonna take you to the ER.

12:36.714 --> 12:39.508
No, I can't.
I have so much to do today, so...

12:39.592 --> 12:43.137
Okay, I guess walking around on one foot
in horrible pain is a solution?

12:44.305 --> 12:46.015
Please, let me help you out, okay?

12:46.098 --> 12:48.601
You did me a favor.
Can I please... Can I help you out?

12:50.352 --> 12:51.562
[Sam]  Any relationship,

12:51.645 --> 12:53.522
even friendship, can be complicated.

12:53.606 --> 12:54.607
You can't force it.

12:54.690 --> 12:56.901
I don't want to hang out with him.
He's annoying.

12:56.984 --> 13:00.154
It's rude to say that in front of him.
He's right here.

13:00.237 --> 13:02.490
It's okay. I don't like Sam, either.

13:02.573 --> 13:04.492
-He's a snoozefest.
-See what I'm saying?

13:04.575 --> 13:06.577
Boys, I get my hair cut
once every two years, okay?

13:06.660 --> 13:08.662
All I ask for is 20 minutes
in this kitchen,

13:08.746 --> 13:10.998
so I can spend a few months
not looking like a yeti.

13:11.081 --> 13:13.250
What are we supposed to talk about?

13:13.334 --> 13:15.461
Why not try and find
some common interests?

13:15.753 --> 13:16.712
Upstairs.

13:20.674 --> 13:21.717
Bridges?

13:22.259 --> 13:23.219
No.

13:23.886 --> 13:24.887
Glaciers?

13:24.970 --> 13:25.804
No.

13:26.430 --> 13:27.348
Dirt bikes?

13:27.932 --> 13:29.642
No. Wildlife?

13:29.725 --> 13:30.726
Ugh.

13:31.602 --> 13:32.895
Sex?

13:34.230 --> 13:35.147
Yes.

13:35.856 --> 13:38.275
I've never done it before,
but I expect to soon,

13:38.359 --> 13:39.985
after the Winter Formal Dance.

13:40.069 --> 13:41.987
What? With who?

13:42.071 --> 13:43.364
My girlfriend Paige.

13:43.447 --> 13:45.032
Have you gone through the bases?

13:45.908 --> 13:46.742
What bases?

13:48.369 --> 13:49.453
The bases.

13:50.162 --> 13:52.790
First base, kissing. Second base, boobs.

13:53.374 --> 13:54.667
Third base is the privates.

13:54.750 --> 13:57.169
And the home run? Sex.

13:57.253 --> 13:58.587
That's the order it goes in.

13:58.671 --> 14:01.590
My cousin works at a car wash,
and he knows all about girls.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.092
That's a fortunate resource.

14:03.175 --> 14:06.554
You can't have sex till you visit
all the bases. It's a rule.

14:12.643 --> 14:14.436
This is where I write all the rules.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.521
Yep.

14:24.071 --> 14:25.239
[JJ] Oh, my God!

14:25.322 --> 14:26.782
Casey, you have to try that on.

14:26.866 --> 14:27.992
No.

14:28.075 --> 14:30.661
No, no, no, no. It is so you.

14:30.744 --> 14:35.374
I'm probably not gonna go to the dance.
Evan's, like, banned from school property.

14:35.457 --> 14:37.668
[chuckles] Try it on. Seriously.

14:37.751 --> 14:38.752
Mm...

14:38.836 --> 14:40.588
It's gonna look really cute on you.

14:41.380 --> 14:42.506
Okay, fine.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.648
[JJ] Don't keep us waiting, Casey.
Is the dress on yet?

15:00.524 --> 15:01.442
Yep.

15:07.406 --> 15:08.616
I'm sorry, Casey.

15:08.699 --> 15:09.700
For what?

15:14.121 --> 15:16.165
[laughing]

15:24.048 --> 15:26.216
Now I know it's getting late,

15:26.300 --> 15:28.594
but we have one last order of business.

15:28.677 --> 15:32.181
Please welcome Newton High School senior
Paige Hardaway.

15:35.434 --> 15:36.769
♪ Dream bigger ♪

15:42.816 --> 15:43.776
♪ Dream... ♪

15:43.859 --> 15:44.693
[Woman] Ah.

15:44.777 --> 15:48.072
Whew! That was disorienting, wasn't it?

15:49.365 --> 15:52.201
Well, for my boyfriend Sam,

15:52.284 --> 15:55.329
life is always like that all the time.

15:56.038 --> 15:57.164
Um...

15:58.415 --> 16:00.751
You see, Sam has autism,

16:00.834 --> 16:04.380
which makes it really difficult
for him to deal with situations

16:04.463 --> 16:07.925
where there's large groups
of people and loud noises

16:08.008 --> 16:09.677
and unpredictable lighting.

16:09.760 --> 16:12.638
But should that mean that Sam is excluded

16:12.721 --> 16:14.181
from really fun things,

16:14.264 --> 16:16.934
like high school dances
that his girlfriend also

16:17.017 --> 16:19.269
really, really, really wants to go to?

16:19.353 --> 16:20.980
No. It doesn't.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.691
So, ladies and gentlemen,

16:23.774 --> 16:27.111
I present to you Silent Night,

16:27.194 --> 16:31.240
an autism-friendly dance
that is 100% silent.

16:31.323 --> 16:33.242
Let me guess, this is all your idea.

16:33.325 --> 16:35.035
No, I don't know anything about it.

16:35.119 --> 16:37.705
I didn't know Sam was interested
in going to the dance.

16:37.788 --> 16:42.209
And I already know what you're thinking.
I mean, silent? That's crazy.

16:42.918 --> 16:46.422
What about the music, right?
Well, there is gonna be music.

16:46.505 --> 16:49.008
It will be piped in
through wireless headphones.

16:49.091 --> 16:51.593
And I've already spoken
to the people at Techtropolis,

16:51.677 --> 16:54.304
and they are willing to donate headphones
for this event,

16:54.388 --> 16:55.931
which is super-cool of them.

16:57.057 --> 16:59.560
So in conclusion,

16:59.643 --> 17:01.729
I think that Newton High should be a place

17:01.812 --> 17:04.356
that's inclusive of all students.

17:06.608 --> 17:08.235
That's it. Thank you.

17:11.071 --> 17:13.240
Okay, so if we're ready to vote?

17:13.323 --> 17:14.783
Yes, April.

17:16.243 --> 17:17.077
Hi.

17:17.161 --> 17:18.245
[clears throat]

17:18.328 --> 17:21.915
I made JJ an appointment, months ago,
to get her hair done.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.917
It's going to cost me about $80.

17:24.585 --> 17:25.419
Um...

17:25.502 --> 17:29.715
Now you want to flatten it
with a bulky set of headphones.

17:29.798 --> 17:32.384
I... I think maybe no.

17:32.468 --> 17:35.387
Um, you know what?
Um, I'm a hairdresser.

17:35.471 --> 17:39.558
So I could do all the kids' hairdos
for free, you know.

17:39.641 --> 17:42.352
-Oh, wow, that would be wonderful, yes.
-Wow!

17:42.436 --> 17:44.563
[April] It's not just about
the hair, right?

17:45.230 --> 17:46.982
I mean, the Winter Formal

17:47.066 --> 17:49.443
is something that our kids
have looked forward to

17:49.526 --> 17:52.571
their entire high school career.

17:53.155 --> 17:56.450
Do we really need to change everything
to accommodate one kid?

17:57.242 --> 17:59.578
I mean, a silent dance, it's just so...

18:00.537 --> 18:01.914
you know, it's sad.

18:04.792 --> 18:06.293
[stammers]

18:06.376 --> 18:07.336
[clears throat]

18:07.419 --> 18:08.879
Well, maybe we should vote.

18:08.962 --> 18:10.297
You know what's sad?

18:11.381 --> 18:15.803
My son never being able
to attend a school event,

18:15.886 --> 18:18.555
because the sounds
are so overwhelming.

18:18.639 --> 18:21.141
You know, never being invited
to a birthday party,

18:21.225 --> 18:23.977
because he was the kid
at Chuck E. Cheese

18:24.061 --> 18:26.105
who couldn't stop screaming.

18:26.188 --> 18:29.441
The isolation, the loneliness,

18:30.609 --> 18:33.278
the lack of experience...

18:35.531 --> 18:36.782
that's sad.

18:38.033 --> 18:40.911
Your perfectly healthy kids
not being able to get an updo,

18:40.994 --> 18:43.038
it's just not on my list.

18:43.872 --> 18:44.706
So...

18:47.543 --> 18:49.670
Okay. Shall we vote?

18:50.337 --> 18:51.380
All the ayes?

18:53.632 --> 18:55.259
And the nays?

18:56.593 --> 18:58.303
Well, the ayes have it.

18:58.387 --> 19:01.723
-Silent dance, here we come.
-Yay!

19:01.807 --> 19:04.560
That's it, everybody. Thank you.
Meeting's adjourned.

19:04.643 --> 19:05.644
[laughs]

19:07.146 --> 19:08.438
[Paige] I'm so excited!

19:10.107 --> 19:11.024
Hey, April.

19:11.692 --> 19:14.486
Um, I'm just curious why you voted

19:14.570 --> 19:16.363
against the silent dance?

19:17.531 --> 19:20.242
Because the world
doesn't revolve around you.

19:20.325 --> 19:21.952
-I'm sorry?
-You should be.

19:22.035 --> 19:24.663
Oh, and I'm sure Casey's gonna love it
at Clayton Prep.

19:24.746 --> 19:27.791
Never mind what happens
to our girls' chances at a state title.

19:27.875 --> 19:32.171
-What does she have to do with this...
-Casey is the anchor in our relay.

19:32.254 --> 19:34.464
There's no way our girls
are gonna qualify without her.

19:34.548 --> 19:38.093
But who cares about that? Right?

19:44.224 --> 19:47.477
[cellphone vibrates]

19:49.271 --> 19:51.356
Case, hey, hon. You okay?

19:51.440 --> 19:53.734
We put our customers first,
so I'm going to help you out.

19:53.817 --> 19:56.195
I'm not ready to take
the D-Train to Bonetown.

19:56.278 --> 19:59.531
Sir, I got to handle this. Any other nerd
in a blue shirt can help you.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.367
What's up?

20:02.451 --> 20:04.578
How can I have sex
when I've never even seen boobs?

20:04.703 --> 20:06.872
Oh, is that what's going on?

20:06.955 --> 20:10.292
Look, when I was a kid,
I was terrified of the water.

20:10.375 --> 20:13.712
Then my dad decided it was time
for me to learn to swim,

20:13.795 --> 20:16.256
so he threw me in the deep end
at Holiday Inn.

20:16.340 --> 20:19.176
Now I swim like an otter.
You probably know all about those, huh?

20:19.259 --> 20:21.637
Of course. They can stay underwater
for up to four minutes,

20:21.720 --> 20:24.181
but what does swimming
have to do with sex?

20:35.067 --> 20:36.401
This isn't a swimming pool.

20:36.985 --> 20:38.737
Nope. It's a titty club.

20:38.820 --> 20:40.572
This way, you'll know what to expect

20:40.656 --> 20:42.991
and won't lose your shit
when you see Paige's boobs.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.535
And bonus, my cousin Sunil
caters the buffet here

20:45.619 --> 20:48.372
and it is off the chain!

20:48.455 --> 20:50.082
This guy knows what I'm talking 'bout.

20:52.417 --> 20:53.377
Okay.

20:54.002 --> 20:54.920
You ready for this?

20:57.172 --> 20:58.090
Yes.

21:20.654 --> 21:22.531
Nope! Not doing that.

21:22.614 --> 21:24.783
Too many lights, too much sound. No way.

21:24.866 --> 21:26.827
Okay, maybe that was a bad idea.

21:27.619 --> 21:30.247
Come to think of it,
I still have a recurring nightmare

21:30.330 --> 21:32.499
where I'm being eaten by a pool raft
shaped like my dad.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.835
You think that's connected?

21:34.918 --> 21:36.795
Hey, man. It's okay.

21:36.878 --> 21:38.130
You did good.

21:39.298 --> 21:42.301
But I was kind of looking forward
to the goat curry tacos.

21:42.384 --> 21:44.761
Have your tacos. I'll wait out here.

21:44.845 --> 21:46.638
I'll be quick. I won't get a lap dance.

21:46.722 --> 21:48.515
Just one plate, then we're out of here.
Cool?

21:48.974 --> 21:49.975
[snaps fingers]

21:54.438 --> 21:55.856
[Destiny] I get it, kid.

21:56.857 --> 21:59.693
I work here and this place
can be too much for me, too.

21:59.776 --> 22:01.278
I use earplugs.

22:01.778 --> 22:05.532
Earplugs can actually cause tinnitus,
which is a ringing in the ears.

22:05.615 --> 22:09.494
I use noise-canceling headphones.
They're much better. You should try them.

22:10.203 --> 22:11.913
-I'm Destiny.
-I'm Sam Gardner.

22:12.873 --> 22:15.542
So why are you standing out here
all alone, Sam Gardner?

22:16.585 --> 22:18.170
My girlfriend wants to have sex,

22:18.253 --> 22:20.047
but I'm nervous and ill-prepared.

22:20.130 --> 22:21.798
I've never even seen boobs before.

22:23.091 --> 22:25.594
-Want some advice?
-Yes, please.

22:27.804 --> 22:31.016
Just be kind to her.
That's all that really matters.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.435
Don't worry about the sex stuff.

22:33.518 --> 22:35.979
At a certain point,
biology will just take over.

22:36.563 --> 22:38.190
Biology is my favorite subject.

22:38.273 --> 22:39.566
Good for you.

22:40.817 --> 22:44.154
But just so that you'll feel
a little more prepared.

22:51.828 --> 22:52.829
Oh.

22:53.622 --> 22:54.456
Wow.

22:55.123 --> 22:56.875
Yeah. I know.

22:58.376 --> 22:59.961
Good luck with your girlfriend.

23:02.422 --> 23:03.757
'Sup, Destiny?

23:03.840 --> 23:05.050
Hey, Zahid.

23:06.718 --> 23:08.011
What did I miss?

23:15.018 --> 23:16.770
I got a fraud alert on my credit card.

23:16.853 --> 23:19.147
You have to pick the most
expensive dress in the store?

23:20.190 --> 23:21.399
[sobs]

23:21.483 --> 23:22.984
Oh, honey.

23:23.068 --> 23:25.821
I'm joking. I'm just kidding you.

23:30.659 --> 23:32.369
I don't want to go to Clayton Prep.

23:33.537 --> 23:34.496
Okay.

23:35.497 --> 23:37.332
And honestly...

23:39.376 --> 23:41.169
I don't know if I can go.

23:42.212 --> 23:45.006
Apparently they found out
that I punched Bailey Bennett.

23:45.090 --> 23:47.843
-I know. I check in with them.
-Then why are you telling people

23:47.926 --> 23:50.053
that I'm going to go there
and buying me shirts?

23:50.137 --> 23:51.847
Because I think you're amazing,

23:51.930 --> 23:53.765
and I think you're gonna get in anyway.

23:54.975 --> 23:56.059
I'm just...

23:56.143 --> 23:57.227
I'm...

23:58.562 --> 24:01.106
I'm scared because I don't want
to leave you guys

24:01.189 --> 24:04.359
and Evan and my team.

24:04.943 --> 24:08.655
Just the whole Clayton Prep thing
is starting to feel kind of like...

24:09.823 --> 24:10.866
Selfish.

24:10.949 --> 24:12.450
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

24:12.534 --> 24:14.202
Even Sharice turned against me.

24:14.286 --> 24:16.163
No. Sharice is your best friend.

24:16.246 --> 24:18.915
When you were little,
she followed you like a puppy dog.

24:18.999 --> 24:20.917
No, she was the one that stole my clothes.

24:21.001 --> 24:22.460
She's a little bitch.

24:22.544 --> 24:23.461
[laughs] I know.

24:28.091 --> 24:29.176
Honey...

24:29.926 --> 24:32.095
It's okay to be a little selfish.

24:36.308 --> 24:37.767
Thanks, Mom.

24:39.060 --> 24:40.312
You kept the tags on, right?

24:40.395 --> 24:41.479
Duh.

24:48.111 --> 24:49.112
How's your foot?

24:49.779 --> 24:53.033
They have to do an x-ray to make sure,
but they think it's fractured.

24:53.116 --> 24:54.075
I'm such an idiot.

24:54.159 --> 24:55.911
I'm sure I've seen way more idiotic.

24:55.994 --> 24:57.120
[laughs]

24:57.996 --> 24:59.915
Yeah, well, thanks for making me come.

24:59.998 --> 25:02.125
I would've ignored this forever
if it weren't for you.

25:02.209 --> 25:06.087
No problem. And I wanted to apologize
about asking you about my own stuff.

25:07.088 --> 25:10.926
I know you're Sam's therapist,
and you try to keep things professional.

25:11.635 --> 25:13.845
-Yeah.
-All right. I'll see you later.

25:15.931 --> 25:16.932
My brother's...

25:18.099 --> 25:19.893
My brother is autistic.

25:21.228 --> 25:24.648
Jesse. He's not as
high functioning as Sam.

25:24.731 --> 25:26.149
He's minimally verbal.

25:26.733 --> 25:29.361
As a kid, we couldn't even walk
through a parking lot

25:29.444 --> 25:33.156
because he'd have to stop behind every car
and read the license plate.

25:34.074 --> 25:36.660
But my parents didn't acknowledge

25:36.743 --> 25:39.371
he was on the spectrum till he was 16.

25:39.454 --> 25:40.413
Hmm.

25:40.497 --> 25:42.457
They kept insisting it was a speech issue

25:42.540 --> 25:43.959
and that he'd grow out of it.

25:45.877 --> 25:47.879
The saddest thing in my life

25:47.963 --> 25:51.424
is wondering what he would've been like
had he gotten interventions early.

25:52.175 --> 25:54.970
It's why I do what I do.

25:55.929 --> 25:59.057
They didn't want to acknowledge it
because they were ashamed.

25:59.140 --> 26:01.643
They were afraid of the social isolation

26:01.726 --> 26:03.520
that comes
with having a kid who's different.

26:04.896 --> 26:06.815
And I feel for them.

26:07.440 --> 26:09.484
You just want to pretend nothing's wrong.

26:10.944 --> 26:13.321
Yeah, well,
I used to be really good at that.

26:16.074 --> 26:18.243
All right, I should get going.

26:18.326 --> 26:22.622
And I'm gonna take you up
on that referral, if it's still okay.

26:23.290 --> 26:24.791
Yeah. Totally cool.

26:24.874 --> 26:26.126
-All right.
-I'll e-mail you.

26:26.209 --> 26:28.420
-Okay. Take it easy.
-Thanks.

26:31.673 --> 26:33.174
[cellphone rings]

26:36.219 --> 26:37.762
Hey. You need something?

26:38.513 --> 26:40.098
Um, no, I just...

26:41.182 --> 26:43.184
I just wanted to apologize.

26:44.769 --> 26:45.603
What?

26:45.687 --> 26:49.608
The way I handled the thing with Chuck
and not telling him about Sam.

26:51.735 --> 26:53.278
I don't know. I don't know.

26:53.361 --> 26:54.946
There's a part of me that's...

26:56.448 --> 26:58.074
that's ashamed.

26:58.783 --> 27:01.703
It's not who I am anymore,

27:01.786 --> 27:03.955
and it's not who I want to be anymore.

27:05.290 --> 27:06.791
Oh, honey.

27:06.875 --> 27:10.754
I don't know why, but I'm going to try
to continue to figure it out

27:10.837 --> 27:12.505
and deal with it better and...

27:12.589 --> 27:13.840
I just--

27:15.133 --> 27:16.676
I'm sorry, okay?

27:17.677 --> 27:18.720
I know.

27:19.929 --> 27:20.805
All right.

27:20.889 --> 27:23.183
Um, are you home yet?

27:23.266 --> 27:25.101
No. I just have, um...

27:25.935 --> 27:28.855
I have one little thing to do
and then I'll be home soon.

27:28.938 --> 27:31.775
Okay, well, I'll see you soon,
and I love you, okay?

27:33.318 --> 27:34.361
Bye.

27:39.491 --> 27:40.700
[Sharice] Mrs. Gardner?

27:41.659 --> 27:44.496
I really need to get to youth group.

27:44.579 --> 27:46.164
Yeah, I don't think so, Sharice.

27:47.123 --> 27:48.083
Where are we going?

27:49.209 --> 27:53.296
I've known you since the third grade.
I've hand-washed your retainer.

27:54.172 --> 27:56.758
I keep mint-flavored Oreos
at the house for you.

27:57.509 --> 28:00.720
Now I want to know what's going on,
and I want to know now.

28:04.474 --> 28:06.142
Okay, I know.

28:06.226 --> 28:08.144
I messed up, and I'm so sorry.

28:09.521 --> 28:11.272
Casey's my best friend, and...

28:11.356 --> 28:12.857
When I heard you were leaving

28:13.608 --> 28:16.111
I just got upset.
I can't believe you didn't tell me.

28:16.945 --> 28:20.073
Well, I didn't want to jinx it.
And I'm not even in the school yet.

28:20.156 --> 28:22.075
You don't tell me anything anymore.

28:22.158 --> 28:24.869
You've got a boyfriend,
and I never see you,

28:24.953 --> 28:27.956
and you got your hair cut
without even talking to me about it.

28:28.039 --> 28:29.249
Okay.

28:30.041 --> 28:31.042
Okay.

28:32.043 --> 28:34.129
-I'm sorry.
-Me, too.

28:34.879 --> 28:36.047
Come here.

28:37.632 --> 28:39.092
Oh! [laughs]

28:40.135 --> 28:42.804
Sharice, this is dumb.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.765
But do you want to be my date
to the dance?

28:46.683 --> 28:50.520
Are you only asking me
'cause Evan can't go because he's a thief?

28:50.603 --> 28:51.604
Yes.

28:51.688 --> 28:53.273
I'd love to!

28:53.356 --> 28:54.691
Okay, great. [laughs]

29:02.532 --> 29:04.909

-What?

29:15.420 --> 29:17.422
That's disgusting!
You need to put that away!

29:17.505 --> 29:19.340
-Seriously, don't--
-I'm not putting it away.

29:19.424 --> 29:21.384
-Erase it. Who taught you that?
-It's beautiful.

-Destiny taught me that.

[Sam] I met Destiny, and she's very nice.

29:33.146 --> 29:34.647
She was very nice.

29:39.652 --> 29:40.570
Finally.

My phone died an hour ago.
I've been sitting alone with my thoughts.

29:43.948 --> 29:46.868
And I'm in the middle of a breakup,
