-Chloe?

24:14.370 --> 24:16.076
Hey.

24:17.081 --> 24:18.446
It's hard to concentrate...

24:18.624 --> 24:22.367
...when Lana was here one minute
and now she's just--

24:28.384 --> 24:30.796
God, I'm so sorry, Clark.

24:46.569 --> 24:48.810
There's more people
that could get hurt right now.

24:50.364 --> 24:52.195
Yeah.

24:52.366 --> 24:54.277
Denial should be our friend right now.

24:55.202 --> 24:58.114
Okay, so this phantom-Clark thing
was inhabiting humans...

24:58.289 --> 25:00.951
...but when he touched you,
it just replicated. Why?

25:02.793 --> 25:04.624
The phantom needed
a Kryptonian body...

25:04.795 --> 25:08.003
...in order to replicate
to become whole again.

25:10.509 --> 25:14.377
Chloe, I don't know how to stop him.
It's not like I can just ﬂy after him.

25:14.555 --> 25:16.420
This guy can ﬂy?

25:16.599 --> 25:18.385
God, Clark, you gotta get on that one.

25:19.268 --> 25:22.852
-Well, where's our Bizarro Clark now?
-I don't know.

25:23.355 --> 25:25.471
But, Chloe, before I hit him...

25:25.649 --> 25:27.856
...his face distorted.

25:28.027 --> 25:29.437
Almost like he was hurt.

25:29.612 --> 25:33.901
Which is why he pushed pause
on his one-man mission to kill you.

25:34.074 --> 25:36.326
Why would your doppelganger
weaken if you didn't?

25:37.620 --> 25:39.451
Everything affects him the opposite.

25:39.622 --> 25:42.238
When Lionel held the meteor to him,
it made him stronger.

25:42.416 --> 25:44.281
Maybe he went to ﬁnd
more meteor rocks...

25:44.460 --> 25:46.872
...so he could recharge
and ﬁnish the job.

25:47.671 --> 25:51.414
Oliver's been tracking all of Lex's
meteor shipments for his 33.1 experiments.

25:51.592 --> 25:54.629
And it says in these records
there were several containers...

25:54.803 --> 25:58.091
...transferred to Reeves Dam
just a couple of weeks ago.

25:58.265 --> 26:02.133
Clark, if he gets there before you do,
no way you can go up against him alone.

26:02.311 --> 26:06.145
-How are you gonna take this guy down?
-I don't know, Chloe.

26:07.608 --> 26:09.064
But there is someone who might.

26:17.576 --> 26:21.114
When you left here, you were hurt
pretty badly. How'd you heal so fast?

26:21.288 --> 26:23.904
| just had to leave
the Earth's atmosphere.

26:24.208 --> 26:25.994
But in my absence...

26:26.168 --> 26:29.752
...it appears you did exactly
what Jor-El was trying to prevent.

26:29.922 --> 26:33.164
l unleashed a carbon copy of myself.

26:33.759 --> 26:35.875
-Only without my....
-Humanity?

26:38.639 --> 26:43.554
What was I supposed to do?
Let him kill every host he inhabited?

26:43.727 --> 26:47.140
That is one of the hardest trials
you will face, Kal-El.

26:47.982 --> 26:51.224
While your humanity
is your greatest strength...

26:51.652 --> 26:54.644
...it is also your greatest vulnerability.

26:56.865 --> 26:58.856
Well, it's part of who I am.

26:59.034 --> 27:01.366
And it's who I wanna be.

27:01.537 --> 27:06.156
I'm proud I was raised to care about people.
And I'm not gonna apologize for it anymore.

27:07.209 --> 27:08.244
I know.

27:09.628 --> 27:15.043
But this creature was discarded
at birth as a poor imitation.

27:15.217 --> 27:18.880
He was shown no compassion,
no conscience.

27:19.054 --> 27:21.670
Therefore he has none.

27:22.224 --> 27:24.715
He knows only one thing:

27:24.893 --> 27:25.882
Survival.

27:27.187 --> 27:30.645
How do I stop someone who has all
my powers and none of my weaknesses?

27:33.736 --> 27:37.570
By opening your eyes to what
you take for granted every day.

27:43.579 --> 27:45.194
Your faith in humans...

27:45.372 --> 27:48.409
...is not the only thing
that gives you strength.

27:50.502 --> 27:52.709
The yellow sun.

27:53.505 --> 27:57.123
That's why his face distorted
when he got into the light.

27:57.760 --> 28:01.173
That may be the only way to defeat him.
I can help.

28:01.347 --> 28:03.053
But it is your battle.

28:09.146 --> 28:13.810
The section of the dam where the rock
is stored shouldn't have been compromised.

28:15.944 --> 28:18.606
The meteor rocks are in there.

28:26.288 --> 28:30.122
I may have tracked you around the globe,
but clearly, you're not a native.

28:31.251 --> 28:32.411
Where are you from?

28:32.586 --> 28:34.542
And why did you only replicate Clark?

28:39.343 --> 28:42.426
Now you got a decision to make, Lex.

28:42.888 --> 28:44.674
What's more important?

28:44.848 --> 28:47.009
Destroying me...

28:47.476 --> 28:49.512
...or solving the mystery of Clark Kent?

28:56.276 --> 28:57.356
Wrong decision.

29:41.655 --> 29:44.692
You had the existence
I could only dream of.

29:44.867 --> 29:46.903
Every pleasure...

29:47.077 --> 29:49.284
...at your disposal, and you wasted it.

29:52.332 --> 29:55.199
You don't deserve this life, Clark.

29:55.586 --> 29:57.042
But I do.

30:03.969 --> 30:05.004
Come on.

31:24.299 --> 31:25.334
Hey.

31:38.689 --> 31:40.520
Is that all you got?

31:51.451 --> 31:53.612
You're no match for my strength.

32:40.375 --> 32:44.493
MAN [OVER RADIO]: The fairy-tale marriage
of Lana Lang to Lex Luthor ended in tragedy.

32:44.671 --> 32:47.788
Sources say the billionaire
is the prime suspect in the explosion...

32:47.966 --> 32:50.548
-...that cut short such a vibrant young life.
CHLOE: Clark?

32:50.719 --> 32:53.677
Police say Lang's vehicle
exploded upon ignition...

32:53.847 --> 32:57.931
...from what is believed to be
a car bomb behind a local coffeehouse.

32:58.101 --> 33:01.389
According to wire services,
a funeral date has yet to be set.

33:01.563 --> 33:03.519
Although no witnesses
have come fon/vard...

33:03.690 --> 33:08.400
...Lex Luthor was apprehended near Reeves
Dam, the source of the recent ﬂooding.

33:08.570 --> 33:12.939
-I know you wanted to be alone, but--
-Lionel Luthor is unaccounted for.

33:13.116 --> 33:16.984
I thought I'd come by and see if I can
get more than two words out of you.

33:18.163 --> 33:21.246
Thanks, Chloe.
I think I'll take a rain check.

33:23.085 --> 33:25.872
Yeah, I guess you deserve
a little bit of peace and quiet...

33:26.046 --> 33:30.710
...after sending the evil Bobbsey Twin
to the sunny side of Mars.

33:30.884 --> 33:33.876
Who's to say he's any more evil
than I am?

33:35.263 --> 33:39.006
Unless you have a second secret identity
that I don't know about, I....

33:42.479 --> 33:46.893
Chloe, when I heard about Lana,
I went to ﬁnd Lex.

33:49.403 --> 33:52.645
And I wasn't gonna let him
leave there alive.

33:54.700 --> 33:58.784
The irony is,
I think it was the ﬁrst time I ever...

33:58.954 --> 34:01.536
...really understood Lex.

34:05.085 --> 34:09.124
Loving someone is hard. It's difﬁcult.

34:10.716 --> 34:12.672
But hate...

34:13.468 --> 34:15.959
...hate is so...

34:17.389 --> 34:19.300
...clean.

34:22.978 --> 34:25.936
Maybe you need to feel this right now.

34:26.231 --> 34:28.768
I mean, anger
is a natural human emotion.

34:30.360 --> 34:32.567
Well, that's just it.

34:34.906 --> 34:38.490
When that phantom was trying to kill me
and I was staring into my own eyes...

34:38.660 --> 34:42.619
...I saw the monster
that I could become if I wanted to.

34:45.333 --> 34:48.370
It was a reminder that I am not human.

34:49.004 --> 34:51.666
Tell that to every person
you've ever saved.

34:51.840 --> 34:55.128
Clark, whether you wanna see it or not,
you're one of us now.

34:55.302 --> 34:59.295
And the fact that you're
from a galaxy, far, far away...

34:59.723 --> 35:01.213
...just adds character.

35:03.351 --> 35:05.433
And you know what? I'm here.

35:05.604 --> 35:09.938
No matter what side of nature
or nurture happens to be winning out.

35:11.026 --> 35:13.392
It goes both ways, Chloe.

35:16.656 --> 35:19.318
Whatever happened in that dam...

35:20.410 --> 35:21.911
...you ended up in a morgue.

35:22.078 --> 35:23.409
Yeah, it was nothing.

35:24.039 --> 35:26.872
-|'m just saying that when you're ready--
-Thanks.

35:32.088 --> 35:33.828
LOIS:
Clark?

35:34.007 --> 35:35.122
There you are.

35:39.429 --> 35:40.464
I forgive you.

35:42.766 --> 35:43.801
For what?

35:44.476 --> 35:47.718
Don't make me relive it.
It was traumatizing enough the ﬁrst time.

35:47.896 --> 35:51.730
And by the way, you've got some
explaining to do there, missy.

35:52.275 --> 35:53.310
Lois, I'm sorry.

35:53.485 --> 35:54.770
LOIS:
I know you are.

35:54.945 --> 35:57.527
And I know you didn't mean it.

35:57.697 --> 36:00.109
You were just in shock.

36:00.534 --> 36:02.695
I heard about Lana on the news.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.701
Clark, I'm so sorry.

36:10.919 --> 36:13.126
Look, all I can say is...

36:13.296 --> 36:16.584
...at ﬁrst you don't know
how you'll ever make it through...

36:16.758 --> 36:18.419
...but somehow you do.

36:18.593 --> 36:20.584
Just trust me on this one.

36:26.142 --> 36:28.599
But if you ever grab my ass again...

36:29.604 --> 36:33.222
...I will be taking your hand
with me when I go.

36:34.693 --> 36:36.524
Okay?

36:47.414 --> 36:50.281
Your father would be proud.

36:52.294 --> 36:55.161
He did everything he could
to prepare you...

36:55.630 --> 36:57.791
...but bravery...

36:58.133 --> 37:00.715
...is not something you can learn.

37:02.387 --> 37:05.800
How much bravery does it take
when you're getting pummeled?

37:06.725 --> 37:08.556
Kal-El...

37:09.519 --> 37:13.307
...you could've ignored all the phantoms
that escaped the Phantom Zone.

37:13.773 --> 37:17.357
But you chose to take
responsibility and stop them.

37:17.819 --> 37:19.855
Even one more powerful than you.

37:22.157 --> 37:24.899
In a weird way, he may have been right.

37:26.161 --> 37:28.573
Maybe I have allowed myself
to become weak.

37:28.747 --> 37:32.490
Caring too much about everything,
everyone here.

37:33.043 --> 37:35.830
You've learned a lot
from your time in Smallville.

37:36.713 --> 37:38.294
These people...

37:38.465 --> 37:40.456
...have made you who you are.

37:43.428 --> 37:44.964
They won't always be here.

37:46.014 --> 37:48.676
Losing Lana made me realize,
no matter how close I get...

37:48.850 --> 37:51.307
...someday they'll all be gone.

37:53.438 --> 37:56.976
And all the time that I've spent
ignoring my destiny...

37:57.817 --> 38:00.945
...trying to be something I'll never be:

38:02.280 --> 38:04.020
Human.
