WELCOME TO THE SHOW, STILL

BUT WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
START RIGHT HERE AT HOME, WITH

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
NEW YORK'S GOVERNOR,

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
ANDREW CUOMO.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
A MAN WHOSE FACE, BUILD, AND

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
GENERAL DEMEANOR ALWAYS SEEMS TO

01:09.000 --> 01:09.000
SCREAM "BUSINESS FRANKENSTEIN."

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
CUOMO HAS BEEN IN SOME HOT WATER

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
LATELY.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
>> THIS MORNING, NEW YORK

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
GOVERNOR ANDREW CUOMO'S

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
ADMINISTRATION IS UNDER FEDERAL

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
SCRUTINY FOR ITS HANDLING OF

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
COVID-RELATED FATALITY DATA AT

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
NURSING HOMES.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
THE FALLOUT COMES AFTER A

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
76-PAGE REPORT FROM NEW YORK'S

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
ATTORNEY GENERAL LAST MONTH

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
REVEALED THE STATE HAD BEEN

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
UNDERREPORTING DEATHS IN NURSING

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
HOMES AND LONG-TERM CARE

01:31.000 --> 01:37.000
FACILITIES BY AS MUCH AS 50%.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
>> John: UNDERREPORTING NURSING

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
HOME DEATHS -- YOU'D EXPECT THAT

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
LESS FROM A TRANSPARENT

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
DEMOCRACY, AND MORE FROM AN

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
AUTHORITARIAN REGIME LIKE NORTH

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
NORTH KOREA, WHICH

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
TO THIS DAY HAS YET TO REPORT

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
A SINGLE CASE OF CORONAVIRUS.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
I ASSUME THEIR STATE MEDIA IS

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
CLAIMING THAT THE VIRUS WAS

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
REPELLED FROM THE COUNTRY AFTER

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
KIM JONG-UN BREATHED FIRE ON IT.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
THIS SCANDAL STEMS FROM A

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
DIRECTIVE CUOMO MADE LAST MARCH,

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
TELLING NURSING HOMES TO ACCEPT

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
COVID-POSITIVE PATIENTS

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
TO FREE UP HOSPITAL BEDS.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
THAT WOULD BE BAD ENOUGH, BUT

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
SINCE THEN, HIS ADMINISTRATION

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
HAS TRIED TO DOWNPLAY ANY

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
CONSEQUENCES OF THAT ACTION --

02:07.000 --> 02:07.000
RELEASING A REPORT LAST JULY

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
THAT LAID THE BLAME ON

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
NURSING HOME STAFFERS FOR

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
INFECTING RESIDENTS, AND,

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
AS A CUOMO AIDE RECENTLY TOLD

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
LAWMAKERS, ACTIVELY CONCEALING

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
DATA ON COVID DEATHS OUT OF FEAR

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
IT'D BE USED AGAINST THEM BY

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
FEDERAL PROSECUTORS.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
THAT REVELATION, UNDERSTANDABLY,

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
SET OFF A FIRESTORM.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
AND AFTER A DEMOCRATIC

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
LEGISLATOR, RON KIM, MADE A

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
STATEMENT ABOUT IT TO THE PRESS,

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
HE SAYS HE GOT A CALL FROM CUOMO

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
THAT WENT ABOUT AS WELL AS YOU

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
MIGHT EXPECT.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
>> THE GOVERNOR ASKED ME TO

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
ISSUE A STATEMENT THAT COUNTERED

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
WHAT I HEARD IN THE MEETING AND

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
ESSENTIALLY COVER UP THE

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
COVER-UP.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
HE SPENT 10 MINUTES BERATING ME,

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
THREATENING ME TO END MY CAREER

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
IN FRONT OF MY FAMILY, IN FRONT

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
OF MY KIDS.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
>> John: YEAH, NOT GREAT.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
NOW, I HAVE TO SAY,

02:57.000 --> 02:57.000
CUOMO HAS DENIED KIM'S ACCOUNT

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
OF THAT CALL.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW, MANY, MANY

03:00.000 --> 03:00.000
PEOPLE WHO'VE DEALT WITH CUOMO

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
IN THE PAST HAVE SAID IT SOUNDS

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
EXACTLY LIKE HIM.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
AND THAT REPUTATION ALONE

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
GOES A LONG WAY.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
BE HONEST, IF YOU SAW A HEADLINE

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
TOMORROW THAT SAID, "LEAKED MEMO

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
SHOWS JOHN OLIVER ASKED STAFF

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
IF BIRD HE SAW IN CENTRAL PARK

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
HAD AN ONLYFANS PAGE,"

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
YOU'D BELIEVE IT.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
EVEN IF I DENIED THE ACCOUNT OF

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
THAT CONVERSATION, DEEP DOWN,

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
YOU'D KNOW IT HAPPENED, BECAUSE

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
IT JUST SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
I'D DO.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
AND CUOMO IS FAMOUSLY

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
UNPLEASANT.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
HE REPORTEDLY HAS A

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
"DO-NOT-YELL-AT" LIST,

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
WHICH A FORMER AIDE APPARENTLY

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
ADMITTED IS VERY SMALL.

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
AND JUST THIS WEEK,

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
A DIFFERENT FORMER AIDE ACCUSED

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
HIM OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT,

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
A CLAIM HE DENIES.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
ALTHOUGH, ON THE SAME DAY THAT

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
STORY BROKE, CUOMO WAS AT A

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
VACCINATION SITE, AND COULDN'T

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
HELP HIMSELF FROM JOKING ABOUT

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
VACCINATING THIS STATE SENATOR.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
>> I'M GOING TO BE DOING

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
THE VACCINATION.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
I GET TO SELECT THE PART OF THE

03:48.000 --> 03:54.000
ANATOMY WHERE I DO THE VACCINE.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
AND YOU'LL BE SURPRISED, OR

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
MAYBE NOT, WHEN YOU SEE THE PART

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
OF THE ANATOMY THAT I PICK.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
>> John: IS IT HIS PENIS,

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
ANDREW?

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
ARE YOU GOING TO VACCINATE HIM

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
IN THE PENIS?

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
BECAUSE I'LL BE HONEST, I WOULD

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
ACTUALLY BE SURPRISED IF YOU

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
WANTED TO VACCINATE HIM IN THE

04:11.000 --> 04:11.000
PENIS.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
THE VEIN IS HARD TO FIND.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
PRACTITIONERS GENERALLY

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
RECOMMEND THE NON-DOMINANT ARM

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
AND ALSO, WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG

04:15.000 --> 04:15.000
WITH YOU?

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
EVEN BEFORE THE CURRENT

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
SCANDALS, THERE WAS SOMETHING

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
GROSS ABOUT CUOMO'S GLEE IN HIS

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
PUBLIC ADULATION LAST YEAR,

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
FROM HIS CONSTANT APPEARANCES

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
WITH HIS BROTHER ON CNN,

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
TO HIM CO-SIGNING ON THE TERM

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
"CUOMOSEXUALS" -- THE ONLY

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
SEXUAL ORIENTATION, BY THE WAY,

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
IT'S COMPLETELY ACCEPTABLE TO

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
TO THE BOOK HE PUBLISHED LAST

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
OCTOBER ABOUT THE LESSONS

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
HE'D LEARNED FROM HANDLING THE

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
STILL-ONGOING PANDEMIC,

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
WHICH WERE PRESUMABLY:

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
"1: DO PRESS CONFERENCES."

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
"2: THE END."

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
AND THOSE PRESS CONFERENCES

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
WHERE CUOMO LOVED TO INSIST ON

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
THE IMPORTANCE OF FACTS NOW PLAY

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY, AFTER

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
EVERYTHING WE'VE LEARNED.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
ESPECIALLY MOMENTS LIKE THIS.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
>> "FOLLOW THE FACTS, THEY WILL

04:52.000 --> 04:52.000
SHOW YOU THE WAY,"

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
A.J. PARKINSON.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
NEW YORK, FOLLOWING THE FACTS.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
>> John: OKAY, THE THING IS,

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
IT'S HARD TO FOLLOW THE FACTS

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
IF THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE OF THOSE

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
FACTS ARE ACTIVELY WITHHOLDING

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
THEM FROM YOU.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
AS FAR AS ADVICE GOES, THAT'S

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
BASICALLY AS USEFUL AS A BULLY

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
SAYING "STOP HITTING YOURSELF,"

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
IN THAT IN BOTH CASES, YEAH,

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
I'D ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE TO.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
THE THING IS, SOME ASSHOLE WON'T

05:17.000 --> 05:17.000
LET ME.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
AND YOU MAY'VE NOTICED THAT HE

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
WAS QUOTING SOMEONE NAMED

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
A.J. PARKINSON THERE.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
THAT IS SOMETHING HE DOES A LOT.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
>> REMEMBER, "TEXTBOOKS SAY

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
POLITICIANS LEAD AND THE PEOPLE

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
FOLLOW.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
NO, IT IS OFTEN THE PEOPLE WHO

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
LEAD AND THE POLITICIANS WHO

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
FOLLOW," A.J. PARKINSON.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
>> A.J. PARKINSON, GREAT QUOTE,

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
"I RESPECT ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
AREN'T TYPICAL POLITICIANS."

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
>> "DON'T PASS THE BUCK WITHOUT

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
PASSING THE BUCKS,"

05:40.000 --> 05:40.000
A.J PARKINSON.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
>> A.J. PARKINSON.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
>> A.J. PARKINSON.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
>> A.J. PARKINSON.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
>> A.J. PARKINSON.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
>> A.J. PARKINSON SAID THAT.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
>> John: NOW, IF YOU'RE

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
CURRENTLY THINKING, "OH, NO,

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHO

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
A.J. PARKINSON IS?"

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
DON'T WORRY, HE'S NOT A FAMOUS

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
HISTORICAL FIGURE THAT YOU

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
LEARNED ABOUT IN SCHOOL, LIKE

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
PLATO, OR JANE AUSTEN,

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
OR JAMES JOYCE.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
ALTHOUGH, IN FAIRNESS, YOU

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
DIDN'T LEARN MUCH ABOUT THEM

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
EITHER, CONSIDERING YOU DIDN'T

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
REALIZE THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
SOCRATES, THAT'S EMILY

06:04.000 --> 06:04.000
DICKINSON, AND THAT'S

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
T.S. ELIOT.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
BUT THE POINT IS, IT'S ACTUALLY

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
COMPLETELY FINE NOT TO BE

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
FAMILIAR WITH A.J. PARKINSON,

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T EXIST.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
HE'S A COMPLETELY MADE UP

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
PERSON.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
APPARENTLY, BY CUOMO'S DAD,

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
FORMER GOVERNOR AND KEVIN SPACEY

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
COSPLAYER MARIO CUOMO.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
HE USED TO INVOKE THE NAME OF

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
A.J. PARKINSON AS AN INSIDE JOKE

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
WITH THE PRESS.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
AND WHILE THAT MAY HAVE BEEN

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
CHARMING AT THE TIME,

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
THE CURRENT CUOMO DOING IT

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
DURING A PANDEMIC WHEN VIRTUALLY

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
NO ONE GETS THAT IT'S A JOKE IS

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
A PRETTY WEIRD MOVE.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO LIGHTEN THE

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
MOOD, THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
REAL QUOTES YOU COULD HAVE GONE

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
WITH.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
FOR EXAMPLE, NICKI MINAJ'S

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
TWEET, "OKAY, BOYS, WHAT'S YOUR

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
BALL SIZE?"

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
SURE, NOT APPROPRIATE FOR THE

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
OCCASION, BUT AT LEAST SHE'S

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000

SEARCHES FOR DRUGS.

>> John: HE "SMELLED MARIJUANA."

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
COME ON!

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
IF YOU JUST "SMELL MARIJUANA,"

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
YOU DON'T SHOW UP WITH LOADED

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
ASSAULT RIFLES LIKE YOU'RE IN

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
"CALL OF DUTY."

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
YOU SHOW UP WITH

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
"SETTLERS OF CATAN" AND $50

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
WORTH OF COOKIES FROM SUBWAY.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
DON'T BE SUCH FUCKING SQUARES.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
AND THE THING IS, ABSURDLY

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
DISPROPORTIONATE AND DANGEROUS

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
RESPONSES ARE BASICALLY PAR FOR

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
THE COURSE WHEN IT COMES TO

13:48.000 --> 13:48.000
POLICE RAIDS.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
THEM -- WHY THEY'RE SUCH

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
A FAVORED TOOL OF POLICE,

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
WHY THEY REALLY SHOULDN'T BE,

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
AND WHAT WE SHOULD DO ABOUT

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
THAT.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
AND LET'S START WITH WHAT YOU

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
PROBABLY KNOW ALREADY, WHICH IS

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
THAT NOT ALL OF US ARE AT EQUAL

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
DANGER OF BEING RAIDED.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
WHEN CBS 2 IN CHICAGO DID AN

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
INVESTIGATION OF SEVERAL YEARS'

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
WORTH OF SEARCH WARRANTS,

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
THEY FOUND THAT CERTAIN

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
NEIGHBORHOODS TENDED TO BE HIT

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
A LOT MORE OFTEN THAN OTHERS.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
>> ENGLEWOOD HAD 872

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
SEARCH WARRANTS.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
ALSO IN THE TOP FIVE

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
NEIGHBORHOODS ARE AUSTIN

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
WITH 668, NORTH LAWNDALE, 455,

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
GARFIELD PARK, 442, AND

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
HUMBOLDT PARK WITH 376.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
CENSUS DATA SHOWS THESE

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
NEIGHBORHOODS ARE ALL NEARLY

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
90% OR MORE BLACK AND LATINO.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
WE FOUND ONLY A SMALL PERCENTAGE

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
HAPPEN IN WHITE NEIGHBORHOODS

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
AND NONE LISTED FOR EDISON PARK,

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
PRINTERS ROW, WRIGLEYVILLE,

14:37.000 --> 14:37.000
MUSEUM CAMPUS,

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
AND MAGNIFICENT MILE.

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
>> John: YEAH, THAT'S ABOUT

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
AS FUCKED AS YOU'D EXPECT.

14:45.000 --> 14:45.000
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY, YOU DIDN'T

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
HAVE TO TELL ME THOSE

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
NEIGHBORHOODS ARE

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
PREDOMINANTLY WHITE.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
BECAUSE EDISON PARK,

14:51.000 --> 14:51.000
MUSEUM CAMPUS, AND

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
MAGNIFICENT MILE ARE SOME OF

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
THE WHITEST SOUNDING PLACE NAMES

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
I'VE EVER HEARD.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
RIGHT UP THERE WITH ALABASTER

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
PRIM, SPF-50-VILLE, AND VERMONT.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
AND THAT RACIAL DISPARITY

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
HAS BEEN FOUND AGAIN AND AGAIN.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
IN LOUISVILLE, AN EXAMINATION

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
FOUND SEARCH WARRANTS

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
DISPROPORTIONATELY TARGETED

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
BLACK RESIDENTS, AND A STUDY

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
OF ONE YEAR OF WARRANTS IN

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
WASHINGTON, D.C. FOUND THEY WERE

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY EXECUTED IN

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
BLACK COMMUNITIES.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
AND POLICE HAVE BEEN GIVEN TOOLS

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
TO CARRY OUT THOSE WARRANTS WITH

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
INCREASING FORCE.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
POLICE DEPARTMENTS HAVE BECOME

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
HEAVILY MILITARIZED AFTER EITHER

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
PURCHASING OR JUST BEING HANDED

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
MILITARY EQUIPMENT.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
AND SOME DON'T EVEN TRY TO HIDE

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
HOW MUCH THEY ENJOY USING IT.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
JUST LISTEN TO THIS OFFICER

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
INTRODUCE ONE OF HIS TOYS IN A

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
CAREER DAY LIVESTREAM FOR KIDS.

15:32.000 --> 15:32.000
>> WE CALL THIS THE BIG BAD

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
WOLF.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
BECAUSE WITH ENOUGH FORCE,

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
I CAN TAKE THIS RAM ON THE FRONT

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
OF THIS VEHICLE AND I CAN PUT IT

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
AGAINST A BRICK HOUSE AND I CAN

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
GO RIGHT THROUGH THAT BRICK.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
AND I CAN COME RIGHT IN

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
YOUR HOUSE IF I NEED TO.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
NOT YOUR HOUSE, BECAUSE ALL

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
OF YOU ARE GOOD KIDS.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
WE ONLY DO IT FOR THE BAD KIDS.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
>> John: OH, YOU DO, DO YOU?

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
WELL, THAT'S REASSURING.

15:55.000 --> 15:55.000
WE'VE CERTAINLY GOT NO REASON

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
NOT TO TRUST YOU TO DETERMINE

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
WHO'S A GOOD KID AND A BAD KID.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
YOU'RE JUST A NICE, TALKATIVE

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
GUY WHO, APPARENTLY, ROOTS FOR

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
THE WOLF IN THE STORY OF THE

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
THREE LITTLE PIGS.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
"IF ONLY THE WOLF HAD POSSESSED

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
MILITARY GRADE EQUIPMENT,"

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
YOU SAY AS YOU TUCK YOUR

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
CHILDREN IN AT NIGHT.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
"FORTUNATELY, YOUR GOD-LIKE

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
FATHER HAS NO SUCH LIMITATIONS

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
ON HIS POWERS.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
SLEEP TIGHT, GOOD KIDS!"

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
NOW, THERE ARE IMPORTANT

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
QUESTIONS OVER WHETHER OR NOT

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
POLICE OFFICERS REALLY NEED

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
ACCESS TO THAT KIND OF

16:20.000 --> 16:20.000
EQUIPMENT, JUST AS THERE ARE

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
QUESTIONS OVER WHAT MESSAGES

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
THEY TAKE AWAY FROM SOME OF

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
THE TRAINING THEY RECEIVE.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
TAKE A LOOK AT ONE PARTICULARLY

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
EXTREME EXERCISE FOR

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
S.W.A.T. TEAM MEMBERS.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
>> THE CULT LEADER REALIZES

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
THAT THEY GOT AN ARMORED VEHICLE

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
GOING TO START.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
HE GOES, OKAY, LET'S PULL

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
THE TRIGGER, SENDS OUT THE RPG,

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
AND THEN THEY START EXECUTING

16:37.000 --> 16:37.000
PEOPLE.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
>> OH, MY GOD.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
>> IT'S REALLY A MASS SUICIDE.

16:40.000 --> 16:40.000
BUT IN FACT, IT'S REALLY A

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
MURDER SUICIDE.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
>> NONE OF THE SCENARIOS WE SAW

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
LEFT MUCH ROOM FOR NONVIOLENT

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
SOLUTIONS.

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
>> AND THEN BACK IN HERE,

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
THE CULT LEADERS BASICALLY

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
SYSTEMATICALLY EXECUTING BABIES.

16:53.000 --> 16:53.000
>> SHOW ME YOUR HANDS,

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
SHOW ME YOUR HANDS!

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
>> WHEN THE AMOUNT OF HOURS

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
YOU SPEND AT THE SHOOTING RANGE

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
OUTNUMBER THE NUMBER OF HOURS

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
YOU SPEND LEARNING CONFLICT

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
RESOLUTION BY, YOU KNOW,

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
10 OR 15 TO ONE, YOU'RE GOING TO

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
BE MORE LIKELY TO USE THE TOOL

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
THAT YOU'VE TRAINED MORE WITH.

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
>> John: YEAH, NO SHIT!

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
BECAUSE LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
THEY SHOULDN'T BE PREPARED FOR

17:13.000 --> 17:13.000
CULT LEADER BABY MURDER.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
BUT HOW MANY CULT LEADER

17:14.000 --> 17:14.000
BABY MURDERS DO THEY THINK

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
THEY'RE GOING TO BE CALLED TO

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
EVERY YEAR?

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
AND I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING,

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
"BUT JOHN, IF THERE IS A BABY

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
MURDER CULT, HOW ARE WE GOING

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
TO REPLACE ALL THOSE BABIES?"

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
DON'T WORRY.

17:23.000 --> 17:23.000
I'M PRETTY SURE I KNOW A GUY

17:23.000 --> 17:32.000
WHO CAN HELP.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
>> I'M THE BABY MERCHANT!

17:33.000 --> 17:33.000
TOTS 'R' US.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
>> John: SERIOUSLY.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
IT'S THREE MINUTES LONG.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
IT'S SO WEIRD.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
I'M NOT SAYING YOU SHOULD SEEK

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
IT OUT, I'M JUST SAYING,

17:39.000 --> 17:39.000
YOU DO NEED TO KNOW IT EXISTS.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
THE OBVIOUS DANGER OF FOSTERING

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
A MILITARIZED POLICE CULTURE

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
THAT TRAINS AND EQUIPS OFFICERS

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
LIKE THEY'RE THE LEAD IN AN

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
ACTION MOVIE IS THAT IT CAN

17:45.000 --> 17:45.000
ENCOURAGE THEM TO THEN ACT

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
THAT WAY.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
TAKE A LOOK AT A RAID THAT

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
TOOK PLACE IN LITTLE ROCK.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
HERE, THE POLICE BLOW OPEN THE

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
DOOR OF THE APARTMENT BELONGING

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
TO A MAN NAMED RODERICK TALLEY,

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
BECAUSE THEY FALSELY BELIEVED

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
HE WAS SELLING COCAINE.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
BUT DESPITE NOT FINDING ANY,

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
WHEN THEY REALIZED HE HAD

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
A HOME SECURITY CAMERA, THEY

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
ASKED HIM -- WHILE HE WAS STILL

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
CUFFED TO A CHAIR -- IF THEY

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
COULD REWATCH THE FOOTAGE OF

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
THEIR RAID, SO THEY COULD SEE

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
HOW IT LOOKED.

18:08.000 --> 18:08.000
>> THAT'S AWESOME, I'M GONNA

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
RECORD THAT REAL QUICK.

18:09.000 --> 18:19.000
>> CAN YOU PLAY IT BACK AGAIN?

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
>> THAT WAS WORTH COMING TO WORK

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
FOR.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
ONE MORE TIME.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
WE AIN'T LAUGHING AT YOU,

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
THOUGH.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
>> John: YEAH, DON'T WORRY,

18:28.000 --> 18:28.000
WE'RE NOT

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
LAUGHING AT YOU, WE'RE JUST

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
HIGH-FIVING OURSELVES FOR

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
HOW COOL IT LOOKED WHEN WE BLEW

18:31.000 --> 18:31.000
YOUR DOOR IN.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
BUT YOU GET IT!

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
YOU WERE THERE!

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
BY THE WAY, THANKS FOR BEING

18:34.000 --> 18:34.000
SUCH A GOOD SPORT ABOUT THIS,

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
EVEN THOUGH WE DO ALL HAVE GUNS

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
SO YOU KIND OF HAVE TO BE!

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
THIS JOB IS FUN!

18:38.000 --> 18:43.000
AND POLICE MIGHT TELL YOU THAT,

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
THEY DON'T JUST USE GUNS, THEY

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
ALSO HAVE SUPPOSEDLY NONLETHAL

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
TOOLS OUT THERE TO EXPOSURE.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
BUT EVEN THEN, THERE CAN BE

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
ISSUES. TAKE FLASHBANG GRENADES.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
IN THEORY, THEY JUST STUN AND

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
DISORIENT PEOPLE.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
BUT THEY CAN GENERATE HEAT

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
IN EXCESS OF 2,000 DEGREES.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
SO YOU'D HOPE OFFICERS WOULD

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
BE REALLY CAREFUL WITH THEM,

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
CERTAINLY A LOT MORE CAREFUL

19:00.000 --> 19:05.000
THAN THIS.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
>> WE HEARD A LOUD -- A LOUD

19:06.000 --> 19:06.000
NOISE, WHICH WAS BUSTING THROUGH

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
THE DOOR.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
>> THEN CAME A FLASH GRENADE

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
RIGHT INTO THE TWO-YEAR-OLD'S

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
BED.

19:12.000 --> 19:12.000
YOU CAN SEE BY THIS PICTURE

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
HOW BADLY IT WAS DAMAGED.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
>> AND I KEPT BEGGING THE

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
OFFICER, YOU KNOW,

19:16.000 --> 19:16.000
"GIVE ME MY SON.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
JUST LET ME HOLD HIM.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
HE'S SCARED.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
HE NEEDS ME."

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
THE OFFICER TOLD ME TO SHUT UP

19:21.000 --> 19:21.000
AND GO SIT DOWN.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
>> POLICE WERE LOOKING FOR

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
DRUGS, BUT FOUND NOTHING.

19:26.000 --> 19:32.000
>> John: YEAH, THE POLICE THREW

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
A FLASHBANG GRENADE INTO A CRIB.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
AND LOOK, I'M NO POLICEMAN.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
I HAVEN'T STUDIED ALL THE

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
BYLAWS, I DON'T HAVE A PhD IN

19:37.000 --> 19:37.000
FLASH GRENADE-OLOGY.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
BUT PURELY AS A LAYPERSON,

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
THE POLICE SHOULD NOT HAVE

19:40.000 --> 19:40.000
THROWN THAT FUCKING GRENADE

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
INTO A FUCKING CRIB.

19:42.000 --> 19:42.000
AND IF THE POLICE ARE TRULY

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
INCAPABLE OF KNOWING WHETHER

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
THEY'RE THROWING A GRENADE

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
INTO A CRIB, MAYBE THEY

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
SHOULDN'T HAVE FUCKING GRENADES.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
HERE'S ANOTHER QUICK RULE THAT

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
APPLIES TO BOTH HORSESHOES AND

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
HAND GRENADES: IF YOU THROW

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
EITHER OF THEM INTO A CRIB

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
EVEN ONE TIME, GUESS WHAT?

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
YOU DON'T GET TO PLAY WITH THEM

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
ANYMORE.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
NOW, THANKFULLY, THAT BABY

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
SURVIVED.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
BUT IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
POLICE DIDN'T REALIZE THERE WERE

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
CHILDREN IN THE HOUSE, GIVEN

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
THE FAMILY HAD LIVED AT THAT

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
ADDRESS FOR TWO MONTHS, AND

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
THERE WAS A MINIVAN WITH

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
FOUR CAR SEATS IN THE DRIVEWAY.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
AND WHEN THEY DID FIND THE MAN

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
THEY WERE ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
AT A DIFFERENT HOUSE, HE

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
SURRENDERED PEACEFULLY WHEN

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
OFFICERS KNOCKED ON HIS DOOR.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
SO IN HINDSIGHT, GRENADING

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
A BABY MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
NECESSARY.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
AND, AGAIN, THEY WERE LOOKING

20:27.000 --> 20:32.000
FOR DRUGS.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
AND, AGAIN, THEY DIDN'T FIND

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
WHAT THEY WERE LOOKING FOR.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
AND TROUBLINGLY, POLICE DON'T

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
HAVE TO WORK VERY HARD TO GET

20:39.000 --> 20:39.000
A WARRANT TO BLOW SOMEONE'S DOOR

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
OPEN.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
JUDGES HAVE TO SIGN OFF ON

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
WARRANTS, AND IDEALLY, THEY

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
WOULD FUNCTION AS A CHECK HERE.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
BUT IN PRACTICE, THEY OFTEN

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
DON'T SPEND MUCH TIME

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
SCRUTINIZING POLICE

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
JUSTIFICATION.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
AN INVESTIGATION IN UTAH OF MORE

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
THAN 10,000

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
ELECTRONICALLY-SUBMITTED

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
WARRANTS FOUND THAT HALF

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
THE TIME, JUDGES APPROVED

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
WARRANTS IN LESS THAN THREE

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
MINUTES, WITH HUNDREDS SIGNED

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
OFF IN LESS THAN 30 SECONDS.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
THAT'S ABSURD!

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
EVEN THE CASES ON

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
"CHRISSY'S COURT" WERE LONGER

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
THAN 30 SECONDS, AND IT WAS A

21:08.000 --> 21:08.000
SHOW ON QUIBI, A PLATFORM THAT

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
WE ALL COLLECTIVELY FEVER

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
DREAMED.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
AND THE BAR FOR GETTING A JUDGE

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
TO SIGN OFF ON A SEARCH WARRANT

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
IS PRETTY LOW.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
ALL YOU NEED IS PROBABLE CAUSE,

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
OR A REASONABLE BELIEF THAT

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
EVIDENCE OF A CRIME WILL BE

21:21.000 --> 21:21.000
FOUND IN THE PLACE YOU WANT TO

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
SEARCH.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
AND THAT BELIEF CAN COME FROM

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
ANYWHERE.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
WHETHER IT'S THE SMELL OF

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
MARIJUANA OR, VERY OFTEN,

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
THE WORD OF A CONFIDENTIAL

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
INFORMANT, WHO MIGHT BE TRADING

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
TIPS FOR MONEY OR LENIENCY.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
AND A LOT OF THOSE TIPS TURN OUT

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
TO BE COMPLETE BULLSHIT.

21:37.000 --> 21:45.000
TO GET THE SEARCH WARRANT THAT

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
LED TO THE RAID ON

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
RODERICK TALLEY'S HOME,

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
POLICE TOLD A JUDGE THAT

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
A CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANT HAD

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
BOUGHT COCAINE FROM HIM, AND

21:50.000 --> 21:50.000
THAT THEY'D OBSERVED THE

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
INTERACTION.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
BUT LUCKILY, TALLEY HAD A

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
DOORBELL CAM THAT SHOWED

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
THE INFORMANT WALKING UP TO

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
THE DOOR, ALONE, STANDING THERE,

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
AND THEN WALKING AWAY.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
AND LOOK, NORMALLY, I'M NOT

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
A BIG FAN OF DOORBELL CAMS.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
ALL THEY DO IS RECORD ME GIVING

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
MYSELF A FIVE MINUTE PEP-TALK

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
BEFORE I ENTER ANY PARTY.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
BUT IN THIS INSTANCE, I'M REALLY

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
GLAD HE HAD ONE.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
AND POLICE HAVE SOMETIMES BEEN

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
CAUGHT MAKING INFORMANTS UP,

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
GIVING MISLEADING INFORMATION

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
IN THEIR WARRANT APPLICATION,

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
OR FAILING TO DO EVEN THE MOST

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
BASIC CHECKING TO SEE IF THEIR

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
SUSPECT IS ACTUALLY IN THE HOME

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
THEY'RE RAIDING, OR SOMEWHERE

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
ELSE THAT THEY PROBABLY SHOULD

22:25.000 --> 22:25.000
HAVE KNOWN ABOUT.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
>> JOLANDA BLASSINGAME SAYS IT

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
WAS UTTERLY TERRIFYING, CHICAGO

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
POLICE ALLEGEDLY BREAKING HER

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
DOOR DOWN IN NORTH LAWNDALE,

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
POINTING RIFLES AT HER CHILDREN

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
IN WHAT'S BEING CALLED A

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
COLOSSAL POLICE BLUNDER.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
>> THEY DID NOT BOTHER TO

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
PERFORM THE SIMPLEST,

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
MOST ROUTINE VERIFICATION.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
THE TARGET OF THE WARRANT,

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
MR. BELL, WAS AT THAT TIME

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
SERVING A 20-YEAR PRISON

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
SENTENCE FOR A MURDER CONVICTION

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
200 MILES AWAY IN HILL

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
CORRECTIONAL CENTER IN

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
GALESBURG, ILLINOIS.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
>> John: WELL, THAT'S

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
PRETTY EMBARRASSING.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
BUT I GUESS IT'S LIKE WHEN

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
YOU TURN YOUR HOME UPSIDE-DOWN

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
LOOKING FOR YOUR KEYS, ONLY TO

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
DISCOVER THEY WERE IN YOUR

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
POCKET THE WHOLE TIME.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
ONLY IN THIS CASE, THE KEYS ARE

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
A MAN, THE HOME ISN'T YOURS, AND

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
YOUR POCKET IS A MEDIUM-SECURITY

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
PRISON IN ANOTHER ZIP CODE.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
SO WHEN YOU HAVE BAD POLICE WORK

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
ON THE FRONT END, AND MINIMAL

23:15.000 --> 23:15.000
JUDICIAL OVERSIGHT ON THE BACK

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
END, IT BECOMES FAR TOO EASY TO

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
GET A SEARCH WARRANT.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
AND ONCE POLICE HAVE ONE, THERE

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
REALLY AREN'T A LOT OF LIMITS ON

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
WHAT THEY CAN DO.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
JUST ABOUT EVERY SEARCH WARRANT

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
GIVES OFFICERS PERMISSION TO

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
BREAK DOWN A DOOR TO CONDUCT

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
THE SEARCH.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
AND I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF TALK

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
RIGHT NOW SPECIFICALLY ABOUT

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
"NO-KNOCK" RAIDS, BUT IT'S WORTH

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
NOTING, THE LINE BETWEEN "KNOCK"

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
AND "NO-KNOCK" IS VERY VERY

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
THIN, THANKS TO A SERIES OF

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
COURT RULINGS LIKE THIS:

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
>> THE U.S. SUPREME COURT RULED

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
TODAY POLICE DO NOT HAVE TO

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
WAIT MORE THAN 20 SECONDS BEFORE

23:48.000 --> 23:55.000
BREAKING INTO A DRUG SUSPECTS'

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
HOME, THE UNANIMOUS RULING SAID

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
WAITING ANY LONGER WOULD LET

23:57.000 --> 23:57.000
SUSPECTS FLUSH EVIDENCE

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
DOWN THE TOILET.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
>> John: YEAH, THE RULING WAS,

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
GIVING YOU 20 SECONDS TO ANSWER

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
YOUR DOOR IS REASONABLE, BECAUSE

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
YOU MIGHT FLUSH EVIDENCE DOWN

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
THE TOILET.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
WHICH RAISES THE OBVIOUS

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
QUESTION HERE,

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
WHY THE FUCK ARE WE

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
RAIDING PEOPLE'S HOMES FOR AN

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
AMOUNT OF EVIDENCE THAT CAN BE

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
FLUSHED AWAY IN 20 SECONDS?

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
UNLESS SOMEONE IS ACCUSED OF

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
TRAFFICKING SMURFS OR STEALING

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
THE WORLD'S MOST VALUABLE

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
GOLDFISH, MAYBE WE SHOULD BE

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
FINDING A DIFFERENT WAY TO DO

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
THIS.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
AND POLICE REALLY AREN'T

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
INCENTIVIZED TO GIVE YOU ANY

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
SECONDS TO ANSWER YOUR DOOR.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
BECAUSE IN 2006, THE SUPREME

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
COURT RULED THAT, EVEN WHEN THEY

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
VIOLATE THE RULES REQUIRING THEM

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
TO KNOCK, ANNOUNCE, AND WAIT,

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
THE PROSECUTION CAN STILL USE

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
THE EVIDENCE OBTAINED DURING

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
THAT SEARCH.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
SO THERE'S OFTEN NO MEANINGFUL

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
CONSEQUENCES TO BUSTING RIGHT

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
THROUGH YOUR DOOR.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
AND DECISIONS LIKE THAT MEAN THE

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
DISTINCTION BETWEEN A NO-KNOCK

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
RAID AND A "KNOCK AND ANNOUNCE"

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
RAID IS BARELY THERE.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
AS A JUDGE IN GEORGIA PUT IT,

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
"EITHER THE DOOR COMES IN AND

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
PEOPLE ARE YELLING,

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
"SHERIFF'S OFFICE" OR

24:52.000 --> 24:52.000
PEOPLE YELL, "SHERIFF'S OFFICE"

24:52.000 --> 24:59.000
AND THE DOOR COMES IN."

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
AND THAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY

25:00.000 --> 25:00.000
THE SAME!

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
IT'S LIKE COMPARING

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD AND

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
JESSICA CHASTAIN.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
ARE THEY DIFFERENT?

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
NOMINALLY, SURE, ALTHOUGH NOT

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
IN ANY WAY THAT MEANS ANYTHING.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
IF YOU DO NEED TO TELL THEM

25:08.000 --> 25:08.000
APART, BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD IS

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
THE ONE WHO LOOKS SLIGHTLY MORE

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
LIKE JESSICA CHASTAIN.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
AND ON TOP OF ALL OF THIS, THERE

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
IS JUST CASE AFTER CASE OF THE

25:15.000 --> 25:15.000
POLICE MESSING UP THE EXECUTION

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
OF A RAID, THAT RANGE FROM THE

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
HORRIFIC TO THE ALMOST

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
CARTOONISHLY IDIOTIC -- LIKE

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
THIS VIDEO OF THEM LOOKING FOR

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
A SUSPECTED DRUG DEALER,

25:27.000 --> 25:27.000
BUT INSTEAD

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
RAIDING THE HOME OF HIS

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
NEIGHBOR, ONREE NORRIS,

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
A 78-YEAR-OLD WITH HEART

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
PROBLEMS WHO THANKFULLY

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
SURVIVED, DESPITE THE POLICE

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
MAKING ONE MISTAKE AFTER

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
ANOTHER.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
>> HOW DID DEPUTIES END UP

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
HITTING A HOUSE WITH A DIFFERENT

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
COLOR, A SEPARATE DRIVEWAY,

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
ITS OWN MAILBOX, AND ANOTHER

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
ADDRESS?

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
>> WHAT'S WRONG?

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
>> MISSED IT.

25:43.000 --> 25:50.000
>> OH!

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
[BLEEP].

25:52.000 --> 25:52.000
>> [BLEEP]!

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
>> MISSED IT.

25:54.000 --> 25:54.000
>> FIRST, THE TACTICAL TEAM GOT

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
LOST FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS FROM

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
A GPS APP ON A PHONE.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
>> TURN RIGHT ON --

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
>> THEN, AS SOON AS THEY GOT

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
TO THE CORRECT ADDRESS,

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
DEPUTIES WERE IMMEDIATELY

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
CONFUSED.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
>> WHERE'S THE HOUSE?

26:03.000 --> 26:07.000
WHERE'S THE HOUSE?

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
>> THEY WALKED RIGHT PAST THE

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
TARGET HOUSE WITHOUT CLEARING IT

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
AND HEADED THROUGH THE TREE LINE

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
TO THE NEXT HOUSE ON THE STREET.

26:15.000 --> 26:15.000
EVEN THEN, DEPUTIES WERE UNSURE.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
>> THIS HOUSE?

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
THIS HOUSE?

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
>> LOOKING BACK AND FORTH

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
AT THE TWO HOUSES,

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
IT WAS TOO LATE.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
THE ENTRY TEAM WAS ALREADY

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
FORCING ITS WAY INTO ONREE'S

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
HOME.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
>> John: OH, FOR FUCK'S SAKE.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
IT IS HUMILIATING TO WATCH A

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
TRAINED TACTICAL UNIT OUTFITTED

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
WITH MILITARY HARDWARE GET SO

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
COMPLETELY STUMPED BY

26:41.000 --> 26:41.000
"THE MYSTERY OF THE

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
MORE THAN ONE HOUSE."

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
AND YOU MIGHT THINK, "OH, THAT'S

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
JUST A ONE-OFF" -- MISTAKES LIKE

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
THAT HAPPEN ALL THE TIME.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
>> IT WAS A TOTAL NIGHTMARE FOR

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
THIS FAMILY WHEN COPS BURST INTO

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
THEIR HOME, WHICH TURNED OUT TO

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
BE THE WRONG ADDRESS.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
>> THAT IS THE WRONG APARTMENT.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
AND THAT IS THE ONE THAT

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
THE S.W.A.T. TEAM WENT INSIDE.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
>> SHAWN AND HIS WIFE, WHO BOTH

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
WORK FULL TIME, LIVE HERE.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
THE PEOPLE THE POLICE WERE

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
LOOKING FOR LIVE HERE.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
>> THE DEA IS APOLOGIZING FOR

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
BURSTING INTO THE RENCK FAMILY

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
HOME WITH THE BRADLEY COUNTY

27:11.000 --> 27:11.000
S.W.A.T. TEAM, ONLY LATER

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
FINDING OUT THAT IT WAS

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
THE WRONG HOME.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
>> THAT'S NOT A MISTAKE TO MAKE.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
HELL, YOU COULD HAVE LOOKED

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
AT THE MAILBOX.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
>> John: YEAH, EXACTLY.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
AND THE POLICE HITTING

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
THE WRONG ADDRESS IS JUST

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE WHEN

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
THE STAKES ARE SO HIGH.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
EVEN EDIBLE ARRANGEMENTS MANAGES

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
TO DELIVER TO THE CORRECT

27:30.000 --> 27:34.000
ADDRESS, AND THAT BUSINESS IS

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
JUST PURE CHAOTIC EVIL.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
"HAPPY ANNIVERSARY!

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
PLEASE ENJOY THIS FLAVORLESS

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
CRUCIFIED MELON."

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
AMAZINGLY, THERE OFTEN AREN'T

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
CONSEQUENCES FOR CASES LIKE

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
THOSE.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
OFFICERS ARE RARELY CRIMINALLY

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
CHARGED, AND EVEN MORE RARELY

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
CONVICTED.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
BOTCHED RAIDS USUALLY AREN'T

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
EVEN INVESTIGATED, UNLESS

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
SOMEONE IS KILLED, THE MEDIA

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
GETS INVOLVED, OR THERE'S

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
A LAWSUIT.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
AND EVEN WHEN THEY HAPPEN,

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
POLICE OFFICERS ARE PROTECTED

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
FROM CIVIL LIABILITY BY THE

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
DOCTRINE OF QUALIFIED IMMUNITY.

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
AS FOR THEIR DEPARTMENTS,

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
THEY AREN'T EVEN RESPONSIBLE FOR

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
PAYING TO REPAIR A BROKEN FRONT

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
DOOR, OR COMPENSATING RESIDENTS

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
FOR ANY OTHER LOSSES OR DAMAGES,

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
EVEN WHEN THEY RAID THE WRONG

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
RESIDENCE.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
WHICH IS JUST ABSURD.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
LOOK, THIS IS OBVIOUSLY

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS, AND NOT

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
JUST FOR THE PEOPLE WHOSE HOMES

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
ARE RAIDED.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
FOR THE POLICE, TOO.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
THAT SAME INVESTIGATION THAT

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
FOUND 81 CIVILIANS HAD BEEN

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
KILLED IN RAIDS FOUND THAT

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
13 POLICE OFFICERS HAD DIED,

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
AS WELL.

28:27.000 --> 28:27.000
WHICH SHOULDN'T BE THAT

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
SURPRISING.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
THESE RAIDS ARE, BY DESIGN,

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
HIGHLY DISORIENTING, AND FOR THE

28:31.000 --> 28:31.000
PEOPLE WOKEN UP IN THE MIDDLE OF

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
THE NIGHT TO THE SOUNDS OF AN

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
ARMED INVASION, THEY HAVE TO

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
MAKE A SPLIT-SECOND DECISION

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
WHETHER OR NOT TO DEFEND

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
THEMSELVES.

28:39.000 --> 28:39.000
THAT IS SOMETHING EVERYONE CAN

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
UNDERSTAND.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
IN GEORGIA, A REPUBLICAN STATE

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
SENATOR GOT IN TROUBLE FOR

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
SAYING, IF POLICE RAIDED HIS

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
HOME IN A NO-KNOCK RAID,

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
HE WOULD SHOOT THEM DEAD,

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
AND WHEN HE WAS PUSHED ON THAT,

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
HE DID NOT BACK DOWN.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
>> IF SOMEBODY KICKS DOWN

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
MY DOOR UNANNOUNCED,

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
THEY WILL MEET WITH RESISTANCE,

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
I GUARANTEE YOU.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
>> BUT IF IT'S LAW ENFORCEMENT?

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
THEY WOULD BE THERE --

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
>> HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW AT

29:03.000 --> 29:03.000
3:00 IN THE MORNING?

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
SOMEBODY SHOWS UP IN

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
BLACK OUTFITS, THEY CAN SAY

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
THEY'RE LAW ENFORCEMENT.

29:06.000 --> 29:06.000
MAYBE THEY'RE NOT.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
THEY'VE GOT A GUN POINTED AT ME.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, DALE?

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
>> John: YEAH, DALE!

29:10.000 --> 29:15.000
WHAT'RE YOU GONNA DO?

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
I KNOW THAT GUY LOOKS LIKE A BIT

29:18.000 --> 29:18.000
OF A BELLIGERENT ASSHOLE,

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
BUT THE THING IS, THE COUNTRY

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
IS FULL OF BELLIGERENT ASSHOLES,

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
AND LOTS OF THEM HAVE GUNS.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
AND WHILE IT IS EASY FOR

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
A WHITE STATE SENATOR TO

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
FANTASIZE ABOUT HIMSELF,

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
OR INDEED, DALE, MOUNTING A

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
HYPOTHETICAL ARMED RESISTANCE

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
TO A POLICE RAID, FOR THOSE WHO

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
ACTUALLY DO GET RAIDED, THERE

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
ARE REAL CONSEQUENCES TO THOSE

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
ACTIONS -- IF NOT DEATH, THEN

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
SERIOUS CRIMINAL CHARGES.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
JUST A FEW HOURS AFTER

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
BREONNA TAYLOR WAS KILLED,

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
HER BOYRIEND, KENNETH WALKER,

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
WHO BELIEVED THE POLICE WERE

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
INTRUDERS, WAS CHARGED WITH

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
ATTEMPTED MURDER FOR FIRING

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
HIS GUN DURING THE RAID AND

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
ALLEGEDLY INJURING AN OFFICER

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
IN THE LEG.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
THOSE CHARGES WERE DROPPED,

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
BUT ONLY BECAUSE HE HAD NATIONAL

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
ATTENTION AND A GOOD LAWYER.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
MEANWHILE, 18-YEAR-OLD

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
TYLER HARRELL WAS SENTENCED TO

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
13 AND A HALF YEARS IN PRISON

29:59.000 --> 29:59.000
AFTER HE INJURED A POLICE

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
OFFICER DURING A SURPRISE

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
DRUG RAID AT HIS HOME, EVEN

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
THOUGH A JURY FOUND "NO PROOF

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
THAT HE KNEW HE WAS SHOOTING

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
AT POLICE."

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
LIVES ARE GETTING DESTROYED

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
THROUGH POLICE RAIDS.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
AND EVEN IF NOBODY GETS

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
PHYSICALLY HURT, THAT DOESN'T

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
MEAN NO DAMAGE IS DONE.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
HAVING YOUR HOME VIOLATED IS

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
A TRAUMATIZING EXPERIENCE,

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
OFTEN EXACERBATED BY HOW TARGETS

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
OF RAIDS ARE TREATED.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
TAKE ANJANETTE YOUNG,

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
A SOCIAL WORKER IN CHICAGO WHOSE

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
HOME WAS RAIDED, AND WHO FOUGHT

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
HARD TO GET THE BODY CAMERA

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
FOOTAGE RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC,

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
EVEN THOUGH IT IS INCREDIBLY

30:33.000 --> 30:33.000
DIFFICULT TO WATCH.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
>> YOU SEE THEM RUNNING UP TO

30:35.000 --> 30:39.000
THE APARTMENT COMPLEX WITH THE

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
BATTERING RAM IN THEIR HAND.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
IT WAS SO TRAUMATIC TO HEAR

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
THE WAY THE THING WAS HITTING

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
THE DOOR.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
>> GO, GO, GO, GO!

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
SEARCH WARRANT!

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
SEARCH WARRANT!

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
POLICE SEARCH WARRANT!

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
>> AND IT HAPPENED SO FAST,

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO PUT ON

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
CLOTHES.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
>> YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG HOUSE!

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
>> AND SHE WAS RIGHT.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
THEY WERE IN THE WRONG HOUSE.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
WE FOUND THEY SIMPLY TOOK THE

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
WORD OF AN INFORMANT WHO GAVE

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
THEM ANJANETTE YOUNG'S ADDRESS.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
THE INFORMANT CLAIMED A

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
23-YEAR-OLD MAN WHO WAS A KNOWN

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
FELON HAD A GUN AND AMMO INSIDE.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
>> I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT PERSON

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
IS.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
I'VE BEEN LIVING HERE FOR FOUR

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
YEARS AND NOBODY LIVES HERE

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
BUT ME!

31:16.000 --> 31:16.000
>> OKAY.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
OKAY.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SHOUT.

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
>> I DON'T HAVE TO SHOUT!

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
THIS IS RIDICULOUS!

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
>> John: YEAH, IT IS.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
THEY BROKE INTO HER HOME, HAVING

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
DONE NEXT TO NO DUE DILIGENCE,

31:27.000 --> 31:31.000
AND HANDCUFFED HER COMPLETELY

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
NAKED, BEFORE EVENTUALLY

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
THROWING A BLANKET OVER HER,

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
WHILE SHE WAS STILL

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
HANDCUFFED.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
AND THEN THEY SAID, "YOU DON'T

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
HAVE TO SHOUT."

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
SHOUTING IS NOT THE DRASTIC

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
MEASURE BEING TAKEN HERE.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
PEOPLE SHOUT FOR MANY REASONS.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
BECAUSE THEY WANT PEANUTS.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
GET UP OR JUST BECAUSE THE SONG

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
TOLD THEM TO.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
WHEN YOU ARE HANDCUFFED NAKED

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
IN YOUR OWN HOME BECAUSE

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
THE POLICE SCREWED UP

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
A SEARCH WARRANT, SHOUTING

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
SHOULD BE IN YOUR FUCKING

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
MIRANDA RIGHTS.

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
AND WHEN YOU TREAT PEOPLE

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
LIKE THAT, IT'S CLEAR YOU HAVE

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
NO INTEREST IN FORGING A HEALTHY

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMMUNITY

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE SERVING.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
INSTEAD, THE COMMUNITY HAS TO

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
LIVE WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
NO SPACE IS TRULY SECURE FROM

32:08.000 --> 32:12.000
THE THREAT OF POLICE VIOLENCE.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
THAT IS A MESSAGE THAT IS

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
RECEIVED LOUD AND CLEAR

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
FROM A VERY YOUNG AGE.

32:16.000 --> 32:21.000
SO WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT IT?

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
WELL, I WOULD ARGUE SMALL

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
CHANGES JUST AREN'T GOING TO CUT

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
IT HERE.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
BECAUSE, YEAH, IT WOULD BE

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
BETTER IF SEARCH WARRANTS WERE

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
HARDER TO GET AND OFFICERS WERE

32:31.000 --> 32:31.000
REQUIRED TO VERIFY INFORMATION

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
FROM CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANTS AND

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
WE DIDN'T GIVE MILITARY GRADE

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
EQUIPMENT TO PEOPLE WHO CAN'T BE

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
TRUSTED NOT TO THROW IT

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
INTO A FUCKING CRIB.

32:39.000 --> 32:39.000
BUT THAT IS JUST NOT NEARLY

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
ENOUGH.

32:40.000 --> 32:40.000
AND EVEN REFORMS THAT APPEAR

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
SWEEPING CAN BE PRETTY LIMITED.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
AFTER BREONNA TAYLOR'S DEATH,

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
NO-KNOCK WARRANTS WERE BANNED

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
IN, AMONG OTHER PLACES,

32:46.000 --> 32:50.000
LOUISVILLE AND VIRGINIA,

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
WHICH INITIALLY SOUNDS GOOD.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
THE THING IS, AS YOU'VE SEEN

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
TONIGHT, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
"NO KNOCK" AND "KNOCK" IS

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
BASICALLY NO DIFFERENCE AT ALL.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
AND I'D ARGUE THAT THERE IS

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
A BIG SOLUTION HERE THAT IS

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
STARING US RIGHT IN THE FACE.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
AND THAT IS, STOP DOING DRUG

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
RAIDS.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
JUST STOP IT.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
AND IF THAT SOUNDS EXTREME,

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
YOU MIGHT WANT TO KNOW, THE

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
TACTICAL OFFICERS ASSOCIATION

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
RECOMMENDS THAT RAIDS NEVER

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
BE USED TO SERVE NARCOTICS

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
WARRANTS, SAYING, "WHY WOULD YOU

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
RUN INTO A GUNFIGHT?

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
YOU DEFINITELY DON'T GO IN AND

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
RISK YOUR LIFE FOR DRUGS."

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
AND HE'S RIGHT.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
DRUG RAIDS JUST HAVE TO STOP.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
AND RAIDS IN GENERAL SHOULD ONLY

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
BE USED A LAST RESORT TO SAVE

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
LIVES THAT ARE IN IMMEDIATE

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
DANGER.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
BECAUSE BURSTING INTO SOMEONE'S

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
HOME IS NEVER GOING TO BE SAFE

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
FOR ANYONE INVOLVED.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
AND RIGHT NOW, RAIDS ARE BEING

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
USED FAR TOO WIDELY, AND ARE

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
DESTROYING LIVES, BOTH FOR

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE KILLED,

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
INJURED, OR TRAUMATIZED,

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
AND ALL THE BLACK AND BROWN

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
INTERNALIZE THE LESSONS

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
OF THAT TRAUMA.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
THEY DESERVE THE RESPECT AND

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
CONSIDERATION OF A POLICE FORCE

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO PROTECT THEM,

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
NOT ONE THAT MERELY SEES THEIR

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
LIVES AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
ACTION MOVIE COSPLAY,

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
A THRILLING TV SPECIAL,

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
OR THE REENACTMENT OF

34:03.000 --> 34:09.000
A MISREMEMBERED NURSERY RHYME

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
WITH A SOUPED-UP FUCKING

34:13.000 --> 34:13.000
BATTERING RAM.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
AND MAYBE, JUST MAYBE, IF WE CAN

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
DO THE RIGHT THING HERE, AND

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
CLIMB DOWN FROM OUR CURRENT WILD

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
OVERUSE OF RAIDS, THEN, AND ONLY

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
THEN, WE'D HAVE A POLICE STORY

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
LEGITIMATELY WORTH SINGING

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
ABOUT.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

34:24.000 --> 34:24.000
WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.
