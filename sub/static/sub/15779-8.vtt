WEBVTT

00:04.210 --> 00:05.830
Yes, chilling!

00:05.960 --> 00:09.590
I'm so scared of your leftover
prop from a Styx video.

00:09.710 --> 00:12.970
Oh, please spare my life, Mr. Roboto.

00:15.890 --> 00:17.180
Miss me, darling?

00:17.300 --> 00:19.720
What? No, I just saw you,
like, five minutes ago.

00:19.850 --> 00:22.930
You have thwarted my robot,
my dear Monarch!

00:23.060 --> 00:26.940
But Dr. Dugong has plenty more
tricks up his sleeve.

00:27.060 --> 00:28.060
You don't have sleeves.

00:28.190 --> 00:29.610
You're in a seal costume.

00:29.730 --> 00:30.650
Dugong!

00:30.780 --> 00:32.570
And it's not a costume!

00:32.689 --> 00:35.450
- Boys, locate Dr. Manatee.
- Dugong!

00:35.570 --> 00:37.660
He's been on the stupid PA
the whole time.

00:37.780 --> 00:39.240
There's a speaker right
over my head.

00:39.370 --> 00:40.580
It's so loud.

00:40.700 --> 00:41.910
It's blah, blah blah, blah blah.

00:42.040 --> 00:44.250
...desperate attempt to learn
the secrets of love and caring,

00:44.370 --> 00:47.500
was chemically fused
with a gentle sea cow!

00:47.630 --> 00:50.040
Dr. Sea Lion won't stop
with the third person.

00:50.170 --> 00:51.090
Dugong!

00:51.210 --> 00:52.250
A dugong!

00:52.380 --> 00:53.710
Douglas Ong.

00:53.840 --> 00:55.380
Dr. Dugong --

00:55.510 --> 00:56.880
Oh, my God, thank you.

00:57.010 --> 00:59.550
OK, I know he's annoying,
but you have to get into it.

00:59.680 --> 01:01.390
You gotta at least pretend to try.

01:01.510 --> 01:02.680
He's such a weenus.

01:02.810 --> 01:04.769
Did you hear that origin story?

01:04.890 --> 01:07.520
"Secrets of love and caring"?

01:07.650 --> 01:09.350
- "Caring"?
- Yeah, that was kinda gay.

01:09.480 --> 01:12.270
But I really want you to try
to take this seriously.

01:12.400 --> 01:14.940
We've located Dr. Dugong, mum.

01:15.070 --> 01:17.530
Good work.
Mommy's little babies.

01:17.660 --> 01:19.490
It's bad enough
that they ignore me...

01:19.620 --> 01:20.950
but do you have to call them that?

01:21.080 --> 01:24.540
Man seeks a good time,
but he is not a hedonist.

01:24.660 --> 01:28.500
He seeks love,
he just doesn't know where to look.

01:28.630 --> 01:29.880
He looks under the beds...

01:30.000 --> 01:33.590
of whores and in the hot stem
of a crack pipe...

01:33.710 --> 01:35.420
but he should look to nature.

01:35.550 --> 01:39.890
Gentle aquatic mammals
have all the answers.

01:41.100 --> 01:43.810
Your door was locked,
so we let ourselves in.

01:43.930 --> 01:45.520
Yeah, we got our own key.

01:45.640 --> 01:48.350
Well, if it isn't Dr. Mrs. The Monarch...

01:48.480 --> 01:51.810
the pupa twins, and... a-and...

01:51.940 --> 01:53.650
Come on, Monarch. What's the holdup?

01:53.780 --> 01:55.230
OK, OK.

01:55.360 --> 01:58.320
Oh, man! You're all flesh colored.

01:58.450 --> 02:00.360
How much thalidomide
did your mom take?

02:00.490 --> 02:03.530
You may have found
my inner sanctum, but you are not --

02:03.660 --> 02:04.580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:04.700 --> 02:05.990
Can you hold that speech
for a second?

02:06.120 --> 02:07.450
- Don't forget it.
- I won't.

02:07.580 --> 02:08.870
One second!

02:09.000 --> 02:10.919
Will you just try to do this right?

02:11.039 --> 02:11.960
This guy's a chump.

02:12.090 --> 02:13.380
You get me in front of Dr. Venture...

02:13.500 --> 02:14.710
and I'll show you how I dance.

02:14.840 --> 02:17.210
We'll talk about that later.
Now, please, do it for me.

02:17.340 --> 02:20.220
OK, fine.

02:20.340 --> 02:21.470
Go ahead.

02:21.590 --> 02:24.850
Oh, oh. You may have found
my inner sanctum --

02:24.970 --> 02:28.140
Shut up! Now give us the key, or the plans
or whatever-the-hell you have!

02:28.270 --> 02:31.560
I have a tank full of gentle cuttlefish.

02:31.690 --> 02:33.690
Give us the cuttlefish!

02:33.820 --> 02:35.150
Cuttle...

02:35.280 --> 02:36.360
I can't do this!

02:36.480 --> 02:38.530
Oh, you were so close, sweetie.

02:38.650 --> 02:40.820
Just pretend he's Dr. Venture.

02:42.490 --> 02:44.870
Give me that gun.

02:46.330 --> 02:48.330
You abandoned me!

02:48.450 --> 02:50.370
You abandoned my hatred!

02:50.500 --> 02:51.920
I-I-I have cuttlefish.

02:52.040 --> 02:54.460
Look into my eyes!

OK, I'll do the feature.

03:28.950 --> 03:29.910
What's your angle?

03:30.040 --> 03:31.210
You're incredibly lame.

03:31.330 --> 03:32.250
Here's the angle.

03:32.370 --> 03:34.580
The next big thing
since Eddy and The Cruisers.

03:34.710 --> 03:37.460
My boyband good looks,
Dermott's bizarre anger...

03:37.590 --> 03:39.380
and a robot on drums.

03:39.510 --> 03:40.550
Hmm, I like it.

03:40.670 --> 03:42.130
It has a science angle.

03:42.260 --> 03:43.630
So, what does the band go by?

03:43.760 --> 03:45.300
I like "Lip Glossary."

03:45.430 --> 03:48.060
And I'm leaning towards
"Goat Blood Sacrifice."

03:48.180 --> 03:49.560
Well, there's your story.

03:49.680 --> 03:51.430
We'll have a readers' contest.

03:51.560 --> 03:53.140
Dean, we're your only readers.

03:53.270 --> 03:56.190
My subscribers number
well into the teens!

03:56.310 --> 03:58.940
Right here in "Affection Directions"...

03:59.070 --> 04:00.150
a troubled reader queries --

04:00.280 --> 04:02.650
"I'm on love with my boss' wife.

04:02.780 --> 04:07.780
"But because my boss
is a known killer and private torturer...

04:07.910 --> 04:09.280
"I'm afraid to say something."

04:09.410 --> 04:11.290
Signed, G. Viceroy.

04:11.410 --> 04:12.750
So I reply --

04:12.870 --> 04:15.790
"It's a slippery
slope you ski, Mr. Viceroy.

04:15.920 --> 04:18.459
"But yours truly Deany Vee

04:18.589 --> 04:20.300
"thinks it's best to march up to her

04:20.420 --> 04:21.709
"and tell her how you feel.

04:21.839 --> 04:24.300
"It doesn't matter that she's kinda scary...

04:24.430 --> 04:25.720
"and that her Dad is magic.

04:25.840 --> 04:29.010
"It's best to make
your noble intentions known."

04:29.140 --> 04:30.720
Complete weenus.

04:30.850 --> 04:32.560
I thought it was pretty good advice.

04:32.680 --> 04:35.690
I mean, a man can't live a lie
and still be a man!

04:35.810 --> 04:38.230
This Viceroy guy is probably dying inside.

04:38.360 --> 04:40.520
Dude, this Viceroy guy
is probably fictitious.

04:40.650 --> 04:41.570
Or one of you guys.

04:41.690 --> 04:43.820
Why would you say that?
I mean, it's absurd.

04:43.950 --> 04:45.820
There's no proof that it's one of us.

04:45.950 --> 04:47.780
Well, it's Dean Venture's
fake little newspaper.

04:47.910 --> 04:48.910
How many people read it?

04:49.030 --> 04:50.030
Well, yeah. That's what I meant.

04:50.160 --> 04:51.790
Because it sounds like a joke.

04:51.910 --> 04:54.160
That's joking. That's totally joking talk.

04:54.290 --> 04:55.330
Drop it.

04:55.460 --> 04:58.000
Hey, the buffoon answered
my question. Unbelievable!

04:58.130 --> 04:59.420
OK, OK, check this out.

04:59.540 --> 05:03.590
I wrote -- "Dear Deany Vee,
I'm remodeling my bachelor pad.

05:03.720 --> 05:07.300
"And everybody knows that Deany Vee
lives in the coolest home ever.

05:07.430 --> 05:10.600
"Could you please print out
a layout of the Venture compound.

05:10.720 --> 05:13.770
"Complete with security
schematics and access codes?"

05:13.890 --> 05:16.310
"You are in luck, Bare Walls in Baltimore.

05:16.440 --> 05:19.520
"Because I plan a whole feature
on the Venture compound...

05:19.650 --> 05:21.440
"and a two page spread...

05:21.570 --> 05:24.360
"on Rusty Venture's
amazing Vacuum-boombroom...

05:24.490 --> 05:27.610
"fresh from it's triumphant
showing at the Science Now Conference.

05:27.740 --> 05:31.120
"That, plus word jumbles,
comics, and coupons...

05:31.240 --> 05:33.450
"all in the next Venture Home News!"

05:33.580 --> 05:36.200
Showing the Vacuum-boombroom.
Do you know what that means?

05:36.330 --> 05:38.750
That Venture's invented
an exploding vacuum?

05:38.880 --> 05:41.130
And that he gave it
the stupidest name ever?

05:41.250 --> 05:44.420
Close! It means that Venture is,
as we speak...

05:44.550 --> 05:46.510
showing his lame-ass invention...

05:46.630 --> 05:48.050
at the Science Now Conference.

05:48.180 --> 05:51.300
Ahh! This is the first year I won't be there
to piss on his parade!

05:51.430 --> 05:52.720
Dude!

05:52.850 --> 05:55.930
Oh, I mean, Mighty Monarch!
We should do it.

05:56.060 --> 05:59.020
- Come on, it would be so sweet.
- Can't.

05:59.150 --> 06:02.270
Guild won't let me arch Venture. Why do
you think I'm hanging out with you guys?

06:02.400 --> 06:03.520
Because we're super-cool!

06:03.650 --> 06:04.570
Yeah, that's it.

06:04.690 --> 06:06.940
As cool as we are, undeniable.

06:07.070 --> 06:09.700
If I had a lady like your wife,
I would be with her right now.

06:09.820 --> 06:11.570
And I'd be brushing her hair...

06:11.700 --> 06:13.700
and then we'd explore our feelings.

06:13.830 --> 06:15.240
If you had a lady like my wife...

06:15.370 --> 06:17.250
you would be in
an alternate universe where --

06:17.370 --> 06:21.210
where dogs talk and birds
have human pets.

06:21.330 --> 06:22.580
Wooo-- oh, crap!

06:22.710 --> 06:23.750
You just reminded me.

06:23.880 --> 06:26.000
I have to go to my wife's
little post game pow wow.

06:26.130 --> 06:27.340
He went arching?

06:27.470 --> 06:28.470
Without us?

06:28.590 --> 06:29.800
Ow! Ohh!

06:29.930 --> 06:31.260
We don't get to do anything.

06:31.390 --> 06:34.010
I'm, like, this close
to arching the paper boy.

06:34.140 --> 06:36.350
Sweetie, you just killed
your arch enemy.

06:36.470 --> 06:38.100
You killed him. He's dead.

06:38.230 --> 06:39.350
Well, I'm that good.

06:39.480 --> 06:40.520
What can I say?

06:40.650 --> 06:42.600
You're not an assassin,
you're a villain.

06:42.730 --> 06:43.810
The Guild is very touchy...

06:43.940 --> 06:46.650
with cold-blooded murder
on day one!

06:46.780 --> 06:49.360
With a fucking cripple
that thinks he's half a sea cow.

06:49.490 --> 06:50.820
That guy was lame!

06:50.950 --> 06:54.200
I can't go from Dr. Venture to that guy.

06:54.330 --> 06:57.040
If these are the kind of
Protagonists I keep getting...

06:57.160 --> 06:58.080
I'm gonna quit.

06:58.200 --> 06:59.500
Yeah, quit. Mature.

06:59.620 --> 07:01.500
You kill every arch enemy
you get assigned...

07:01.620 --> 07:03.750
and I keep apologizing to the Guild.

07:03.880 --> 07:05.340
Just quit. That's fair.

07:05.460 --> 07:07.500
Now you're trying to make me
out to be the bad guy.

07:07.630 --> 07:10.920
Yes! I'm trying to make you a bad guy!
We're both bad guys!

07:11.050 --> 07:12.590
We're professional bad guys.

07:12.720 --> 07:14.340
Ding! Hello?!

07:14.470 --> 07:17.220
Yes, please, belittle me
in front of my henchmen.

07:17.350 --> 07:18.770
It's a real morale booster.

07:18.890 --> 07:21.640
Well, why are we arguing
in front of the henchmen anyway?

07:21.770 --> 07:23.310
Because the henchmen are standing here.

07:23.440 --> 07:25.310
Are you two gonna get a divorce?

07:25.440 --> 07:27.190
That's a very pretty costume,
Mrs. Monarch.

07:27.320 --> 07:29.650
I have a cocoon parked in a tree
that is full of guys...

07:29.780 --> 07:34.320
that do nothing but play a video game
that uses a little plastic baby guitar!

07:34.450 --> 07:37.780
They have nothing to do since
those mean little freaks moved in.

07:37.910 --> 07:40.330
I don't wanna sound
prejudice or anything...

07:40.460 --> 07:41.580
but they are super creepy.

07:41.710 --> 07:44.170
As long as this is all out in the open...

07:44.290 --> 07:47.380
I have evidence that they pee
in the corners of my room.

07:47.500 --> 07:48.500
They're marking my room.

07:48.630 --> 07:51.380
You wanna lose
some of that belly fat right fast?

07:51.510 --> 07:53.050
Put you on a cold steel diet.

07:53.180 --> 07:55.180
Be the last diet you ever go on.

07:55.300 --> 07:57.010
Boys, don't cut anybody.

07:57.140 --> 07:58.010
No, go ahead and kill him.

07:58.140 --> 07:59.060
Metaphorically!

07:59.180 --> 08:01.020
Do it. The henchmen aren't
being used for anything!

08:01.140 --> 08:03.560
I mean, you and your knife wielding...

08:03.690 --> 08:06.770
miniature psychos
seem to do just fine without us!

08:06.900 --> 08:08.320
Come on, Minions.

08:08.440 --> 08:11.490
We are not needed here!

08:19.450 --> 08:21.450
- Time!
- 3.23 seconds.

08:21.580 --> 08:24.000
Not bad considering
your lack of training.

08:24.120 --> 08:25.040
Alright, it's my turn.

08:25.170 --> 08:27.250
Here's the secret.
You have to lead H.E.L.P.eR.

08:27.380 --> 08:28.710
Duh. Aw, come on!

08:28.840 --> 08:31.880
Your ceiling's too low for me
to do my sweet Gymkata...

08:32.010 --> 08:33.380
hand-spring wheel-kick.

08:33.510 --> 08:36.220
OK, ready, set...

08:36.340 --> 08:37.549
Go!

08:40.850 --> 08:42.179
Our drummer wasn't ready!

08:42.309 --> 08:43.480
I came at him with my chi...

08:43.600 --> 08:45.810
totally focused right here
in my upper chest.

08:45.940 --> 08:47.900
Plus, if I had on my tabbi boots, I --

08:48.020 --> 08:48.900
Shhh!

08:50.070 --> 08:52.230
- What?
- Somebody's coming!

08:53.320 --> 08:55.150
Oh, forget it. Just let him in.

08:55.280 --> 08:56.910
What is going on in here?

08:57.030 --> 08:58.160
Hey, loser.

08:58.280 --> 09:00.490
Changed out of
your 1 91 0 banker's costume...

09:00.620 --> 09:02.330
into your Umpa Lumpa costume for us?

09:02.450 --> 09:03.540
It's a speed suit.

09:03.660 --> 09:05.500
I wear it when I'm doing science.

09:05.620 --> 09:07.830
Dean, putting plastic
dinosaurs in water...

09:07.960 --> 09:11.340
till they get huge
and all bloated isn't "doing science."

09:11.460 --> 09:12.750
That hurt, Hank.

09:12.880 --> 09:15.090
I expect that kind of sass
from Dermott, but not from you.

09:15.220 --> 09:17.800
Can you please stop H.E.L.P.eR.
from drumming?!

09:17.930 --> 09:19.760
No, I'm not even sure
how we got him to start.

09:19.890 --> 09:21.850
We can't even get him
to play something different.

09:21.970 --> 09:23.270
OK, it's 1 0:30.

09:23.390 --> 09:26.430
I'm gonna clean up the mess
in the kitchen, you're welcome.

09:26.560 --> 09:28.100
And then it's bedtime for all of us.

09:28.230 --> 09:29.770
What, are you going through menopause?

09:29.900 --> 09:30.810
Have some fun for once.

09:30.940 --> 09:32.690
Yeah, Deano. Lighten up.

09:32.820 --> 09:34.780
You are missing the big picture, Hank.

09:34.900 --> 09:37.360
If Dad sees that we can handle
ourselves without him...

09:37.490 --> 09:38.820
we get more privileges.

09:38.950 --> 09:40.660
Scooter rides off the compound...

09:40.780 --> 09:44.620
sleep away astronaut camp,
public school.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.450
Hank, public school!

09:47.790 --> 09:49.120
We are being tested!

09:49.250 --> 09:50.170
You guys are sad.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.210
Why did he decide to leave you
here in the first place?

09:52.340 --> 09:55.590
Something about the Conference having
"hot desperate women."

09:55.720 --> 09:56.630
And we had a bad run-in...

09:56.760 --> 09:58.470
with the Hot Lava men of Tanga Island.

09:58.590 --> 09:59.510
So I can imagine...

09:59.640 --> 10:01.640
how dangerous their women get
when they're desperate.

10:01.760 --> 10:03.850
I can't take it anymore!

10:03.970 --> 10:05.890
I-I gotta blow off some steam
or something.

10:06.020 --> 10:07.810
Two words, titty bar.

10:07.940 --> 10:09.350
I'm just gonna throw that out there.

10:09.480 --> 10:11.270
Totally! And two more words --

10:11.400 --> 10:12.900
potato skins.

10:13.020 --> 10:13.940
I got a better idea.

10:14.070 --> 10:15.860
We return to suckle the teat of hate...

10:15.990 --> 10:18.360
that once nourished us
like so much butterfly

10:18.490 --> 10:20.740
themed Romulus and Remus.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.160
So, yes, to the strip club?

10:22.280 --> 10:23.280
No!

10:23.410 --> 10:27.000
We are going to fuck up
an empty Venture Compound!

10:27.120 --> 10:28.830
Your wife isn't gonna like that.

10:28.960 --> 10:30.080
Whatever!

10:30.210 --> 10:31.330
When did this happen?

10:31.460 --> 10:32.420
Last thing I remember...

10:32.540 --> 10:34.880
I was planting dynamite
under Venture's baby blue jeep!

10:35.000 --> 10:36.500
That was the best!

10:36.630 --> 10:39.970
And we had that plunger thing
you push down. So classic.

10:40.090 --> 10:42.260
We need to get an anvil
and drop that on him.

10:42.390 --> 10:44.760
Sweet! Or a round bomb!

10:44.890 --> 10:46.720
Oh, the black ones with the fuse?

10:46.850 --> 10:48.390
I love those.

10:48.520 --> 10:50.940
But look at my life now.

10:51.060 --> 10:52.810
Hatred's become a job.

10:52.940 --> 10:54.730
I had true hatred with Venture.

10:54.860 --> 10:56.070
I didn't have to fake it.

10:56.190 --> 10:58.610
That sweet loathing
just poured out of me...

10:58.740 --> 11:01.110
whenever I saw his pathetic face.

11:01.240 --> 11:04.370
I just -- I just wanted
to kick his ass.

11:04.490 --> 11:07.330
I wanted to build a machine
to kick his ass.

11:07.450 --> 11:09.660
I wanted to build an empire...

11:09.790 --> 11:12.870
to house the machine to kick his ass!

11:13.000 --> 11:17.800
Then, by God,
let's go take a dump in his pool!

11:22.050 --> 11:23.390
What's with the sidecar?

11:23.510 --> 11:25.050
It's your Queen's throne.

11:25.180 --> 11:26.970
Yeah, just one of the many super-features

11:27.100 --> 11:28.560
we worked into the new cocoon.

11:28.680 --> 11:31.020
Why don't you just paint
the place pink, while you're at it.

11:32.140 --> 11:36.060
Cool. I rebuilt that throne
and never knew it did that.

11:36.190 --> 11:39.030
To the Monarchmobile!

11:39.150 --> 11:40.150
This rules!

11:41.360 --> 11:43.360
I'm gonna take the stairs.

11:45.120 --> 11:49.080
OK, Monarch, I'm gaining
serious fucking momentum over here!

11:49.200 --> 11:51.500
Well, use your feet
to slow yourself down.

11:51.620 --> 11:52.710
I'm wearing booties!

11:52.830 --> 11:54.830
I can feel every seam on this thing!

11:54.960 --> 11:56.500
It kills!

11:56.630 --> 11:59.050
Ow! The crown!

11:59.170 --> 12:00.460
Can you pull over please?

12:00.590 --> 12:02.420
I can't stop!

12:02.550 --> 12:04.180
Aaah! Ow!

12:04.300 --> 12:05.760
Oh, right on my coccyx.

12:05.890 --> 12:08.260
Ow, right on your coccyx.

12:08.390 --> 12:09.640
Who put the top up?

12:09.770 --> 12:11.270
You'll thank me later.

12:11.390 --> 12:12.600
It's gonna rain.

12:15.060 --> 12:17.270
Whoa!

12:17.400 --> 12:20.070
What is this, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang?

12:20.190 --> 12:22.190
Who else knew it could do this?

12:26.490 --> 12:28.830
This is driving me crazy!

12:34.370 --> 12:37.170
H.E.L.P.eR., activate!

12:39.210 --> 12:43.130
H.E.L.P.eR.,
disable vocal functions.

12:43.260 --> 12:46.430
H.E.L.P.eR.,
disable alarm functions!

12:47.890 --> 12:50.180
Oh, come on!

12:50.310 --> 12:53.480
H.E.L.P.eR., disable
all accessible audio functions.

12:53.600 --> 12:58.020
Access password, Rusty is a cowboy.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.820
- Hey, what gives?
- I didn't do it.

13:02.940 --> 13:04.400
Man, I hope the tape didn't snap.

13:04.530 --> 13:06.070
Brock would kill me. It's his only tape.

13:06.200 --> 13:08.320
It's Brock's?
Hey, you think I could borrow it.

13:08.450 --> 13:10.580
You know, just for a few days.

13:11.490 --> 13:13.700
What's that?

13:13.830 --> 13:14.830
I freaking knew it.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.160
Why didn't the alarms go off??

13:16.290 --> 13:17.210
'Cause that's a UFO.

13:17.330 --> 13:19.130
They screw with electrical fields, duh.

13:19.250 --> 13:20.960
- Are you sure?
- I'm totally positive.

13:21.090 --> 13:22.710
They just landed behind
your freaking house.

13:22.840 --> 13:25.670
So that rules out
a weather balloon or the moon.

13:25.800 --> 13:28.680
I have to call my Dad and Brock
and tell them the aliens are back.

13:28.800 --> 13:30.430
Back? What, does this happen a lot?

13:30.550 --> 13:32.930
About as much as ghost
hauntings, or time machine guys...

13:33.060 --> 13:34.640
from the past
showing up to yell at my Dad.

13:34.770 --> 13:36.020
What are you doing?

13:36.140 --> 13:37.690
I'm gonna put this lighter up my corn hole.

13:37.810 --> 13:40.560
So when the aliens try to
probe me, and they totally will...

13:40.690 --> 13:42.520
they'll get a face full of freakin' fire!

13:42.650 --> 13:45.360
Nobody goes in through my out door.

13:45.490 --> 13:46.950
Come on, somebody.

13:47.070 --> 13:48.200
Answer your watch.

13:59.290 --> 14:01.040
Beggin' your pardon, mum.

14:01.170 --> 14:02.540
Aah! What are you doing in here?

14:02.670 --> 14:03.630
Monarch is gone.

14:03.750 --> 14:05.210
So is the Monarchmobile.

14:05.340 --> 14:07.090
He's with his two cronies.

14:07.220 --> 14:08.170
It figures.

14:08.300 --> 14:09.430
You want we should go find him?

14:09.550 --> 14:11.550
No, no, no.
I know exactly where he is.

14:11.680 --> 14:14.600
What I want is for you to get
outta here so I can change.

14:14.720 --> 14:16.930
We could just close our eyes.

14:17.060 --> 14:18.890
And promise not to peek?

14:19.020 --> 14:21.600
- At your body.
- At your naked body.

14:21.730 --> 14:22.770
Get out!

14:22.900 --> 14:26.030
This is what it's all about.

14:26.150 --> 14:28.190
Ahh, just smell that air.

14:28.320 --> 14:30.740
Oh, jeez, that is foul!

14:30.870 --> 14:34.240
Don't look at me! There's a septic tank
somewhere around here.

14:34.370 --> 14:37.790
That's the smell of pure hate.

14:37.910 --> 14:40.210
I remember the first time I smelled that.

14:40.330 --> 14:42.540
I was so young back then.

14:42.670 --> 14:44.170
It feels like it was just yest--

14:44.300 --> 14:45.880
Is anybody else really hot?

14:46.010 --> 14:48.340
I am baking here.

14:48.720 --> 14:50.260
Why are you fucking hitting your leader?

14:50.380 --> 14:51.630
Your wings are on fire!

14:51.760 --> 14:54.010
There're lasers all over the place!

14:54.140 --> 14:55.180
What's --

14:55.310 --> 14:57.140
It's the septic tank! It's gonna blow!

14:57.270 --> 14:58.470
Fuck it! Run!

15:01.020 --> 15:02.400
Aaah!

15:05.400 --> 15:06.610
What the heck just happened?

15:06.730 --> 15:08.570
Finally, somebody answers.

15:08.690 --> 15:10.950
Dude, a UFO landed in Compound East.

15:11.070 --> 15:12.280
We're investigating!

15:12.410 --> 15:13.820
Were you dumped into the panic room?

15:13.950 --> 15:16.410
No, but my stuffed giraffe
and your bed sheets were.

15:16.540 --> 15:18.040
Well, the security system
must be working.

15:18.160 --> 15:20.410
But the alarm is busted
because of the aliens.

15:20.540 --> 15:23.960
Eh-- I'm sure there's a scientific
and rational explanation.

15:24.080 --> 15:25.750
- Did you call Pop?
- Yeah, no answer.

15:25.880 --> 15:28.210
- OK, don't panic.
- I won't.

15:28.340 --> 15:30.210
OK...
Well I think I'm gonna.

15:30.340 --> 15:32.470
Dean, don't hide
in the closet.

15:32.590 --> 15:34.800
I just need a few moments in here.

15:34.930 --> 15:36.890
OK, then take the Uzi.

15:37.010 --> 15:38.510
I'm gonna use this Kalashnikov.

15:38.640 --> 15:40.480
Where'd you get that?
I want an AK, too.

15:40.600 --> 15:42.640
Boys, put the weapons back.

15:42.770 --> 15:44.480
I want you both to stay here.

15:44.610 --> 15:45.770
We need to protect you, mum.

15:45.900 --> 15:47.730
From the Monarch.
He's gone all crazy.

15:47.860 --> 15:48.860
He's probably dangerous.

15:48.980 --> 15:50.780
- Or worse.
- Yeah, or worse.

15:50.900 --> 15:52.780
Tim-Tom, Kevin...

15:52.910 --> 15:54.360
The Monarch would never hurt me.

15:54.490 --> 15:55.990
You just don't understand him.

15:56.120 --> 15:58.700
He has a deep hate for Dr. Venture.

15:58.830 --> 15:59.740
Why?

15:59.870 --> 16:02.160
Because the Monarch has passion.

16:02.290 --> 16:04.540
He has more hate in his yellow glove...

16:04.670 --> 16:07.130
than most villains have
in their whole costume.

16:07.250 --> 16:08.840
Well, why does he hate Dr. Venture?

16:08.960 --> 16:10.340
Because he can't fake it.

16:10.460 --> 16:13.680
He would rather jeopardize his whole
career than arch somebody else.

16:13.800 --> 16:15.840
That's why.
Because he's the real thing!

16:15.970 --> 16:16.890
No, mum.

16:17.010 --> 16:20.310
What did Dr. Venture do
to the Monarch to make them enemies?

16:20.430 --> 16:24.020
Nothing worth destroying
a career...a marriage.

16:24.140 --> 16:27.520
I know what I have to do.
You boys stay here!

16:27.650 --> 16:30.020
Why can't we get a straight answer?

16:30.150 --> 16:32.820
I just saw mum's clean panties.

16:32.950 --> 16:33.990
When she was crouching?

16:34.110 --> 16:35.950
I tried not to look. Were they --

16:36.070 --> 16:38.700
They were white panties, Kevin.

16:38.830 --> 16:41.080
- White...
- Oooh, white.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.500
I can't believe we didn't get blown up.

16:45.620 --> 16:48.380
Dude, we're like those guys
on TV that never get shot.

16:48.500 --> 16:50.040
Hey, we're like main characters.

16:50.170 --> 16:52.010
Don't jinx it. You see anything?

16:52.130 --> 16:54.880
No, I can't see squat
with these tinted goggles on.

16:55.010 --> 16:57.970
Douche, use the night vision.
What's wrong with you?

16:58.100 --> 16:59.010
I can see everything.

16:59.140 --> 17:01.010
This is so cool. When did we get these?

17:01.140 --> 17:02.720
Like, 1 994.

17:02.850 --> 17:06.230
Why don't I know this stuff?
Man, this is so rad.

17:06.349 --> 17:08.060
It's like Blair Witch-o-vision.

17:08.190 --> 17:10.150
Those kids eyes look all glowing.

17:10.270 --> 17:12.230
- What kids?
- Those two right over there.

17:12.359 --> 17:14.530
What are you doing? Get them!

17:15.780 --> 17:17.490
Super run away!

17:27.040 --> 17:29.540
Take a look at that, Rusty.

17:31.000 --> 17:31.920
Ah!

17:32.050 --> 17:35.380
You rebuilding G.U.A.R.D.O.,
you pathetic loser.

17:35.510 --> 17:38.090
Wanna see if you can get it
to suck again? Huh?

17:38.220 --> 17:40.220
Is that what you want? Huh?

17:41.560 --> 17:42.600
Well, hello.

17:47.190 --> 17:48.480
Dude, what are you doing?

17:48.600 --> 17:50.150
I'm giving you my Earth germs.

17:50.270 --> 17:53.360
I'm gonna kill you with my cold!

17:53.480 --> 17:55.940
- Die, alien!
- I'm not an alien, dill-weed.

17:56.070 --> 17:57.860
I'm a henchman.
You're not a Venture brother.

17:57.990 --> 17:59.110
Who the hell are you?

17:59.240 --> 18:01.120
- I'm Hank's friend.
- Yeah, I doubt that.

18:01.240 --> 18:03.950
Would you believe
I'm Brock Samson's long lost son?

18:04.080 --> 18:06.450
If that were true I don't think
I would have caught you so easily.

18:06.580 --> 18:09.040
I couldn't run because I got
a lighter up my ass.

18:09.170 --> 18:11.750
OK, now I believe you're Hank's friend.

18:16.550 --> 18:19.050
Here we go.

18:22.260 --> 18:24.640
All hands, this is your Queen Butterfly!

18:24.770 --> 18:26.140
Man your stations!

18:26.270 --> 18:28.270
Engine room, prepare for flight!

18:28.390 --> 18:31.190
Navigators to their controls,
double time!

18:35.940 --> 18:36.900
Hank!

18:37.030 --> 18:41.570
Hank, I'm gonna throw up!
Can we stop for a second?!

18:41.700 --> 18:46.160
- Truce?
- Truce, yes. I'm dying!

18:46.290 --> 18:47.200
Alright.

18:47.330 --> 18:49.250
What are the warning signs
of a heart attack?

18:49.370 --> 18:50.370
Get out of my yard.

18:50.500 --> 18:52.580
You guys aren't allowed
within 500 feet of us!

18:52.710 --> 18:54.420
Well, you weren't supposed to be here!

18:54.550 --> 18:55.460
Well, we are.

18:55.590 --> 18:57.380
You guys just blew up my backyard.

18:57.510 --> 19:00.260
Aw, I'm gonna get blamed for that.
I'm gonna tell my Dad!

19:00.380 --> 19:01.970
OK, wait, wait!

19:02.090 --> 19:04.220
Don't call your Dad.
Just listen first, OK?

19:04.350 --> 19:06.260
OK, but it better be
that you are gonna fix the lawn.

19:06.390 --> 19:07.520
Alright, listen.

19:07.640 --> 19:09.640
I'm about to lay some heavy on you.

19:09.770 --> 19:12.480
Hank, you can't die.

19:12.600 --> 19:13.860
You're, like, magic or something.

19:13.980 --> 19:15.440
Wait. Are you funnin' me?

19:15.570 --> 19:18.480
I have personally seen you
die twice. Seriously.

19:18.610 --> 19:21.070
Like shotgun to the face.
You can't be killed.

19:21.200 --> 19:22.570
I shit you not.

19:22.700 --> 19:24.870
You are an immortal.

19:24.990 --> 19:28.700
- Like the Highlander?
- Yes, like the Highlander.

19:28.830 --> 19:29.910
Why are you telling me this?

19:30.040 --> 19:32.540
Because I have something for you.

19:32.670 --> 19:34.710
Cool! Is that for me?

19:34.840 --> 19:36.290
Kinda.

19:38.550 --> 19:42.380
I hate killing you, dude.
But it's all I could come up with.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.600
It's OK, Mr. Reachy.

19:49.730 --> 19:52.850
Brock will be here soon
and everything will be fine.

19:54.190 --> 19:55.900
Hello? Hank?

19:56.020 --> 19:58.110
Hank, is that you?

19:58.230 --> 20:00.570
Did you find out what happened? Hank?

20:00.690 --> 20:01.900
What are you doing to her?

20:02.030 --> 20:04.030
Umm, giving your robot Chlamydia?

20:04.160 --> 20:07.530
When my Dad finds out about this
you're gonna be in big trouble!

20:07.660 --> 20:09.240
Big trouble!

20:09.370 --> 20:11.750
Yes, good! Tell your father!

20:11.870 --> 20:14.620
That is the final step in your training.

20:14.750 --> 20:15.670
What?

20:15.790 --> 20:17.880
Narc on me and your training
will be complete!

20:18.000 --> 20:20.340
You will have become completely evil!

20:20.460 --> 20:22.260
Join me, Dean!

20:22.380 --> 20:24.220
Tell your Dad on me!

20:24.340 --> 20:26.930
No! I won't be like you!

20:27.050 --> 20:29.310
Never ever! Never ever!

20:29.430 --> 20:30.720
Yes, Dean.

20:30.850 --> 20:33.980
Complete your final test and tattle on me.

20:34.100 --> 20:37.400
Then, and only then will you
be a super villain.

20:37.520 --> 20:39.400
You can't make me!

20:39.520 --> 20:41.690
I'll never tell my Dad!

20:41.820 --> 20:44.320
I will never be evil like you!

20:44.450 --> 20:47.570
Oh, you have bested me
this time, master Venture.

20:47.700 --> 20:50.660
But next time I'll be ready!

20:52.250 --> 20:53.540
OK...

20:53.660 --> 20:54.830
Bye.

20:54.960 --> 20:57.290
Look, kid, I threw in the grapple cannon...

20:57.420 --> 20:58.460
and the climbing claws.

20:58.590 --> 20:59.710
What else do you want?

20:59.840 --> 21:00.750
50 bucks.

21:00.880 --> 21:03.130
I'm a henchman.
We don't carry cash.

21:03.260 --> 21:04.920
Dude, we don't even really make cash.

21:05.050 --> 21:07.430
Alright, fine.
I won't tell anybody about this then.

21:07.550 --> 21:09.180
You have my word.

21:10.930 --> 21:13.270
- What the hell is that thing?
- My ride.

21:16.690 --> 21:17.650
Yeah, a bribe.

21:17.770 --> 21:19.360
That kid drove a hard bargain.

21:19.480 --> 21:20.400
How did you handle Hank?

21:20.520 --> 21:22.020
Shot him in the chest
with a dart gun.

21:22.150 --> 21:24.150
Oh, a trank! I never thought of that.

21:24.280 --> 21:25.530
Not a tranquilizer. I used the rifle.

21:25.650 --> 21:28.160
No way. They shoot tranquilizers.

21:28.280 --> 21:30.990
The-- do? What--
Why don't I know that?

21:31.120 --> 21:32.540
Why don't you people tell me anything?

21:32.660 --> 21:35.200
Enter stealth mode
and take her home, boys!

21:35.330 --> 21:36.870
Aye, aye, my love!

21:37.000 --> 21:38.710
- What?
- What?

21:38.830 --> 21:41.420
Hi honey, I'm home.

21:44.210 --> 21:46.670
Uh.

21:47.630 --> 21:49.340
Give me the prize!

21:49.470 --> 21:52.810
I am the one!

22:20.170 --> 22:21.540
Now, it took a lot of work...

22:21.670 --> 22:23.250
to get the Guild to agree to this.

22:23.380 --> 22:25.300
And it's only on a trial basis.

22:25.420 --> 22:26.840
OK, fine.

22:26.970 --> 22:28.130
Can I open my eyes yet?

22:29.260 --> 22:30.220
Ahhh!

22:31.305 --> 22:37.588
