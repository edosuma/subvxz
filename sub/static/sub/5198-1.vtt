Amadeus.Directors.Cut.1984.DVDRip.XviD-UnSeeN

00:25.480 --> 00:27.480
Mozart.

00:36.320 --> 00:38.060
Mozart.

00:38.160 --> 00:40.628
Forgive your assassin.

00:41.160 --> 00:44.630
I confess, I killed you.

00:45.120 --> 00:47.759
Si, I killed you, Mozart.

00:51.960 --> 00:55.615
Mozart, pieta.
Forgive your assassin.

00:55.840 --> 00:58.434
Forgive me, Mozart.

01:00.560 --> 01:04.215
Signore Salieri,
open the door, be good now.

01:04.720 --> 01:07.900
Signore, 
we have something special for you.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.230
Something you're going to love.

01:14.720 --> 01:16.720
Is that good.

01:18.960 --> 01:21.460
Signore, believe me,

01:21.560 --> 01:26.500
this is the most delicious thing
I ever ate in my life.

01:26.600 --> 01:30.595
Really, you don't know
what you're miss...

01:35.200 --> 01:38.515
All right, that's enough Signore.
Open the door.

01:41.560 --> 01:44.860
Signore, if you don't open this door...

01:44.960 --> 01:47.820
we`re gonna eat everything and
we're gonna leave nothing for you.

01:47.920 --> 01:52.340
And I'm never gonna come
see you again.

04:42.720 --> 04:45.100
Good morning, Father.

05:13.320 --> 05:15.320
Herr Salieri?

05:47.880 --> 05:49.916
Leave me alone.

05:55.600 --> 05:58.717
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.

06:00.120 --> 06:02.160
Do you know who I`am?

06:03.880 --> 06:06.420
That makes no difference.

06:06.520 --> 06:09.835
All men are equal in God's eyes.

06:13.920 --> 06:15.920
Are they?

06:16.480 --> 06:19.200
Offer me your confession.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.958
I can offer you God's forgiveness.

06:29.120 --> 06:32.860
How well are you trained in music?

06:34.800 --> 06:38.880
I know a little.
I studied it in my youth.

06:38.960 --> 06:41.428
- Where?
- Here in Vienna.

06:42.280 --> 06:45.511
Then you must know this.

06:53.760 --> 06:56.069
I can't say that I do.

06:57.240 --> 06:59.240
What is it?

06:59.640 --> 07:02.700
It was a very popular tune in its day.

07:02.800 --> 07:04.800
I wrote it.

07:06.080 --> 07:08.230
Here, how about this?

07:11.240 --> 07:15.405
This one brought down the house
when we played the first.

07:58.080 --> 08:00.080
Well?

08:02.280 --> 08:05.829
I regret it is not too familiar.

08:06.040 --> 08:09.140
Can you recall no melody of mine?

08:09.240 --> 08:11.873
I was the most famous composer

08:11.973 --> 08:12.420
in Europe.

08:12.520 --> 08:14.988
I wrote 40 operas alone.

08:16.600 --> 08:18.380
Here.

08:18.480 --> 08:20.755
What about this one?

08:35.840 --> 08:37.620
Yes, I know that.

08:37.720 --> 08:40.154
That's charming.

08:40.360 --> 08:43.900
I'm sorry, I didn't know you wrote that.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
I didn't.

08:52.360 --> 08:54.920
That was Mozart.

08:56.760 --> 08:58.760
Wolfgang...

08:58.920 --> 09:02.549
Amadeus Mozart.

09:04.280 --> 09:08.105
The man you accuse yourself of killing.

09:10.560 --> 09:12.596
You've heard that?

09:12.840 --> 09:14.840
Is it true?

09:23.120 --> 09:25.953
For God's sake, my son...

09:28.000 --> 09:32.596
if you have something to confess,
do it now.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.720
Give yourself some peace.

09:39.160 --> 09:41.160
He...

09:42.400 --> 09:44.400
was my idol.

09:47.080 --> 09:49.230
Mozart.

09:50.200 --> 09:53.940
I can't think of a time
when I didn't know his name.

09:54.040 --> 09:55.860
I was playing childish games,

09:55.960 --> 10:00.180
when he was playing music
for kings and emperors.

10:00.280 --> 10:02.840
Even the pope in Rome.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.795
I admit, I was jealous,

10:09.120 --> 10:12.300
when I heard the tales they told about him.

10:12.400 --> 10:14.780
None of the brilliant little prodigy,

10:14.880 --> 10:19.556
but of his father,
who had taught him everything.

10:19.760 --> 10:22.991
My father, he did not care for music.

10:23.640 --> 10:25.100
When I told him,

10:25.200 --> 10:28.685
how I wished I could be like Mozart,

10:28.800 --> 10:33.140
he would say, 
"Why? Do you want to be a trained monkey?

10:33.240 --> 10:39.020
You'd like me to drag you around Europe,
doing tricks like a circus freak?".

10:41.680 --> 10:43.900
How could I tell him

10:44.000 --> 10:48.250
what music meant to me?

11:01.120 --> 11:04.300
While my father prayed earnestly to God,

11:04.400 --> 11:06.960
to protect commerce,

11:07.400 --> 11:09.400
I would offer up,

11:09.440 --> 11:11.510
secretly...

11:12.000 --> 11:15.220
the proudest prayer a boy could think of.

11:15.320 --> 11:19.438
"Lord, make me a great composer.

11:19.680 --> 11:23.468
Let me celebrate your glory through music,

11:23.680 --> 11:26.353
and be celebrated myself.

11:27.720 --> 11:30.420
Make me famous through the world, 
dear God.

11:30.520 --> 11:33.080
Make me immortal.

11:33.840 --> 11:35.840
After I die...

11:35.920 --> 11:41.700
let people speak my name forever
with love for what I wrote.

11:41.840 --> 11:43.840
In return...

11:44.520 --> 11:47.920
I will give you my chastity...

11:48.000 --> 11:50.230
my industry...

11:52.120 --> 11:57.300
my deepest humility,
every hour of my life.

11:57.400 --> 11:59.400
Amen".

12:00.440 --> 12:02.990
And do you know what happened?

12:03.120 --> 12:05.120
A miracle.

12:21.840 --> 12:24.798
My life changed forever.

12:25.640 --> 12:29.220
Of course I knew God had arranged it all.
That was obvious.

12:29.320 --> 12:34.500
One minute I was a frustrated boy
in an obscure little town.

12:34.600 --> 12:36.420
The next I was here...

12:36.520 --> 12:40.005
in Vienna, city of musicians...

12:40.600 --> 12:44.195
and Emperor Joseph, the musical king.

12:44.400 --> 12:49.260
In a few years, I was his court composer. 
Isn't that incredible?

12:49.360 --> 12:52.580
Night after night I sat right next
to the emperor of Austria

12:52.680 --> 12:54.540
playing duets with him,

12:54.640 --> 12:57.870
correcting the royal sight-reading.

13:00.440 --> 13:04.095
Actually, the man had no ear at all.

13:04.440 --> 13:07.245
But what did it matter?

13:07.280 --> 13:10.431
He adored my music.

13:11.200 --> 13:13.200
Tell me.

13:13.240 --> 13:15.620
If you had been me,

13:16.120 --> 13:20.965
wouldn't you have thought
God had accepted your vow?

13:22.160 --> 13:24.740
And believe me, I honored it.

13:24.840 --> 13:27.340
I was a model of virtue.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.740
I kept my hands off women.

13:29.840 --> 13:34.220
I worked hours every day teaching students, 
many of them for free.

13:34.320 --> 13:39.420
Sitting on endless committees
to help poor musicians.

13:39.520 --> 13:42.140
Work and work and work, 
that was all my life.

13:42.240 --> 13:44.276
And it was wonderful.

13:44.520 --> 13:46.875
Everybody liked me.

13:48.840 --> 13:50.910
I liked myself.

13:53.720 --> 13:56.280
Until he came.

13:58.160 --> 14:03.340
He came to Vienna to play
some of his music,

14:03.440 --> 14:08.798
at the residence of his employer,
the Prince Archbishop of Salzburg.

14:10.040 --> 14:13.271
Eagerly, I went there to seek him out.

14:16.160 --> 14:18.276
That night...

14:19.960 --> 14:22.155
changed my life.

14:26.480 --> 14:28.860
As I wandered through the salon,

14:28.960 --> 14:31.660
I played a little game with myself.

14:31.760 --> 14:36.100
This man had written
his first concerto at the age of 4,

14:36.200 --> 14:40.955
his first symphony at 7,
a full-scale opera at 12.

14:41.360 --> 14:43.510
Did it show?

14:45.160 --> 14:47.720
Is talent like that

14:47.920 --> 14:50.593
written on the face?

14:51.920 --> 14:54.354
Which one of them

14:55.160 --> 14:58.152
could he be?

16:55.720 --> 16:58.109
Mozart is not here.

17:03.160 --> 17:04.460
- Stop it.
- I`am.

17:04.560 --> 17:06.940
- Stop it.
- I`am stopping it.

17:07.040 --> 17:10.953
I`am. I'm stopping it. Slowly.

17:11.160 --> 17:15.438
There. You see? I've stopped.

17:15.640 --> 17:17.660
- Now we're going back.
- No.

17:17.760 --> 17:20.420
Yes, yes.
Listen, you don't know where you are.

17:20.520 --> 17:23.240
Here, everything goes backwards.

17:23.480 --> 17:28.076
People walk backwards, and dance backwards, 
and sing backwards and even talk backwards.

17:28.680 --> 17:32.930
- That's stupid.
- Why? People fart backwards.

17:34.840 --> 17:36.840
Ssa-ym-ssik.

17:37.080 --> 17:38.740
Ssa-ym-ssik.

17:38.840 --> 17:41.220
Yes, you are. You are very sick.

17:41.320 --> 17:44.596
No. Say it backwards, shitwit.

17:45.160 --> 17:47.160
Ssa-ym-ssik.

17:47.560 --> 17:49.560
Ssik, kiss.

17:49.640 --> 17:52.029
Ym, my. Ssa.

17:53.160 --> 17:55.674
Kiss my ass.

17:56.560 --> 17:57.940
Em-yrram.

17:58.040 --> 18:00.740
- No, I'm not playing this game.
- Say it, it's serious.

18:00.840 --> 18:02.840
It's very serious.

18:04.800 --> 18:06.800
Yrram.

18:08.120 --> 18:10.120
Marry me.

18:10.760 --> 18:13.860
No... I'm not gonna marry you.
You're a fiend.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.960
Uoy-evol-I-tub.

18:18.040 --> 18:19.700
Tub.

18:19.800 --> 18:21.800
But I...

18:23.480 --> 18:25.260
love...

18:25.360 --> 18:27.715
But I love you?

18:34.560 --> 18:37.438
- Tihs-ym-tae.
- What?

18:42.920 --> 18:44.620
- Eat.
- Eat.

18:44.720 --> 18:47.598
- Ym, my.
- My.

18:47.800 --> 18:49.925
Tihs. Eat my shit.

18:50.120 --> 18:52.156
You filthy fiend.

18:52.360 --> 18:55.158
You filthy...

18:59.400 --> 19:01.470
My music.

19:02.640 --> 19:05.530
They've started without me.

20:14.960 --> 20:18.509
That was Mozart.

20:19.760 --> 20:25.285
That giggling, dirty creature
I'd just seen crawling on the floor.

20:25.720 --> 20:29.100
- I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?
- Indeed.

20:29.200 --> 20:32.660
The Viennese certainly know good music
when they hear it, don't you think?

20:32.760 --> 20:34.760
Certainly.

20:36.240 --> 20:38.310
Your Grace.

20:39.600 --> 20:42.558
Ah, Mozart.

20:43.840 --> 20:46.513
- Why?
- Why what, sir?

20:46.720 --> 20:50.580
Why do I have to be humiliated
in front of my guests,

20:50.680 --> 20:53.020
by one of my own servants?

20:53.120 --> 20:56.620
The more license I allow you,
the more you take.

20:56.720 --> 21:01.020
If His Grace is not satisfied with me,
he can dismiss me.

21:01.120 --> 21:04.660
I wish you to return immediately
to Salzburg.

21:04.760 --> 21:08.940
- Your father is waiting for you there, patiently.
- No, Your Grace.

21:09.040 --> 21:11.995
I mean, with all humility,
I would prefer you dismissed me.

21:12.095 --> 21:13.940
It's obvious I don't satisfy.

21:14.040 --> 21:19.300
I have no intention of dismissing you.
You will remain in my service

21:19.400 --> 21:21.960
and learn your place.

21:56.960 --> 21:58.780
On the page it looked...

21:58.880 --> 22:00.700
Nothing.

22:00.800 --> 22:05.560
The beginning was simple, almost comic.

22:05.880 --> 22:07.500
Just a pulse.

22:07.600 --> 22:11.070
Bassoons, basset horns...

22:11.280 --> 22:14.158
like a rusty squeezebox.

22:16.960 --> 22:19.428
And then, suddenly,

22:19.640 --> 22:21.756
high above it...

22:23.400 --> 22:25.595
an oboe.

22:27.640 --> 22:31.040
A single note, hanging there, unwavering.

22:33.120 --> 22:34.820
Until...

22:34.920 --> 22:37.718
a clarinet took it over...

22:39.960 --> 22:44.272
sweetened it into a phrase of such delight.

22:48.120 --> 22:53.815
This was no composition
by a performing monkey.

22:54.520 --> 22:58.115
This was a music I had never heard.

23:00.760 --> 23:05.180
Filled with such longing,
such unfulfillable longing.

23:06.560 --> 23:09.900
It seemed to me I was hearing
the voice of God.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Excuse me.

23:12.640 --> 23:14.500
But why?

23:14.600 --> 23:19.879
Why would God choose an obscene child
to be his instrument?

23:20.320 --> 23:22.530
It was not to be believed.

23:22.680 --> 23:27.117
This piece had to be an accident.
It had to be.

23:31.120 --> 23:33.120
It better be.

23:33.720 --> 23:36.100
How good is he, this Mozart?

23:36.200 --> 23:41.700
He's remarkable, Majesty. 
I heard an extraordinary serious opera of his last month.

23:41.800 --> 23:45.031
- Idomeneo, King of Crete.
- That?

23:45.800 --> 23:48.780
A most tiresome piece. I heard it too.

23:48.880 --> 23:50.880
Tiresome?

23:51.000 --> 23:55.180
A young man trying to impress
beyond his abilities.

23:55.280 --> 23:57.555
Too much spice.

23:58.400 --> 24:00.400
Too many notes.

24:00.400 --> 24:01.700
Majesty...

24:01.800 --> 24:04.205
I thought it was 
the most promising work

24:04.305 --> 24:05.300
I've heard in years.

24:05.400 --> 24:08.980
Well then, we should make some effort 
to acquire him.

24:09.080 --> 24:12.093
We could use a good German composer

24:12.193 --> 24:13.380
in Vienna, surely?

24:13.480 --> 24:18.620
I'm sure he could be tempted
with the right offer. Say...

24:18.720 --> 24:22.100
an opera in German
for our National Theater.

24:22.200 --> 24:24.200
Excellent, sire.

24:24.280 --> 24:27.300
But not German. I beg, Your Majesty.

24:27.400 --> 24:31.598
Italian is the proper language for opera.

24:31.800 --> 24:34.690
All educated people agree on that.

24:38.360 --> 24:41.100
What do you think, Chamberlain?

24:41.200 --> 24:45.820
In my opinion, sire, 
it's time we had a piece in our own language.

24:45.920 --> 24:49.833
Plain German for plain people.

24:52.720 --> 24:55.154
Kapellmeister?

24:55.360 --> 24:56.980
Majesty...

24:57.080 --> 25:00.990
I must agree with Herr Direttore.

25:01.680 --> 25:03.750
German is...

25:07.120 --> 25:10.396
too brute for singing.

25:13.920 --> 25:15.960
Court composer...

25:16.880 --> 25:18.920
what do you think?

25:19.760 --> 25:23.820
I think it's an interesting notion
to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty.

25:23.920 --> 25:27.065
It should really infuriate the archbishop
beyond measure,

25:27.080 --> 25:29.780
if that is Your Majesty's intention.

25:29.880 --> 25:33.875
You are cattivo, court composer.

25:35.400 --> 25:37.838
I want to meet this young man.

25:37.938 --> 25:40.660
Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him.

25:40.760 --> 25:43.274
Well, there it is.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.720
This is a beautiful wig for you.

26:17.880 --> 26:21.668
It looks so marvelous and I love it.

26:21.880 --> 26:23.880
The other one.

26:25.080 --> 26:29.075
Here is the other one.
I think you will love it.

26:31.480 --> 26:35.180
Here's the third one. 
So? Here we go.

26:35.280 --> 26:38.900
- How do you like it?
- They're all so beautiful.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.720
Why don't I have three heads?

26:42.880 --> 26:44.916
This is funny.

26:45.160 --> 26:47.160
Three heads.

26:47.600 --> 26:48.900
Gentlemen.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.655
- Good morning.
- Morning, Your Majesty.

26:54.800 --> 26:57.500
What do you have for me today?

26:57.600 --> 27:01.460
- Your Majesty, Herr Mozart.
- Yes, what about him?

27:01.560 --> 27:03.560
He's here.

27:05.640 --> 27:07.540
Well, there it is. Good.

27:07.640 --> 27:13.020
Your Majesty, I hope you won't find it improper,
but I've written a little march of welcome in his honor.

27:13.120 --> 27:16.041
What a charming idea, court composer.

27:16.141 --> 27:17.100
May I see?

27:17.200 --> 27:18.620
Just a...

27:18.720 --> 27:21.280
Just a trifle, of course.

27:23.520 --> 27:26.920
- May I try it?
- Majesty!

27:28.760 --> 27:31.055
Let's have some fun.

27:44.920 --> 27:47.912
Delightful, court composer.

27:49.200 --> 27:52.540
May I play it when he comes in?

27:52.640 --> 27:56.340
- You do me too much honor, sire.
- Bring in Herr Mozart, please.

27:56.440 --> 27:58.140
But... slowly, slowly.

27:58.240 --> 28:01.215
I need a minute to practice.

28:23.280 --> 28:25.280
Good, continue.

28:27.040 --> 28:29.076
G, Majesty.

28:31.920 --> 28:33.920
Excellent.

28:35.600 --> 28:37.636
Good, Majesty.

28:37.880 --> 28:41.156
Continue. Very good.

28:42.240 --> 28:44.879
Very good, Majesty.

28:46.840 --> 28:49.434
Tempo. Up.

28:49.640 --> 28:53.300
Lightly, then strongly.
It's a march, Majesty.

28:53.400 --> 28:55.400
Again.

29:32.400 --> 29:34.400
Bravo, Majesty.

29:35.000 --> 29:40.780
Gentlemen, please.
A little less enthusiasm, I beg you.

29:44.800 --> 29:48.349
No, please, please. 
It's not a holy relic.

29:51.120 --> 29:54.900
You know, we have met before.
In this very room.

29:55.000 --> 30:00.260
Perhaps you don't remember it, you were only 6 years old.
He was giving the most delightful concert here.

30:00.360 --> 30:02.980
As he got off the stool, 
he slip and fell.

30:03.080 --> 30:06.900
My own sister Antoinette helped him up.
And you know what he did?

30:07.000 --> 30:10.530
He jumped into her arms and said,

30:10.630 --> 30:15.380
"Will you marry me?
Yes or no?".

30:15.480 --> 30:19.220
You know all these gentlemen, I`m sure.
The Baron Van Swieten.

30:19.320 --> 30:23.020
- I'm a great admirer of yours, young men.
- Thank you.

30:23.120 --> 30:25.415
Kapellmeister Bonno.

30:26.640 --> 30:27.940
My pleasure.

30:28.040 --> 30:31.620
The Director of Opera,
Count Orsini-Rosenberg.

30:31.720 --> 30:35.630
Sir, yes. 
The honor is mine, absolutely.

30:36.280 --> 30:40.140
Here is our illustrious court composer,

30:40.240 --> 30:42.240
Maestro Salieri.

30:43.520 --> 30:46.717
At last, such immense joy.

30:48.360 --> 30:50.360
I know your work well, signore.

30:50.560 --> 30:53.454
Do you know, 
I actually composed some variations

30:53.554 --> 30:55.060
on a melody of yours.

30:55.160 --> 30:58.100
- Really? Which one?
- "Mio Caro Adone".

30:58.200 --> 30:59.620
I'm flattered.

30:59.720 --> 31:02.820
A funny little tune,
but it yielded good things.

31:02.920 --> 31:05.780
And now he has returned the compliment.

31:05.880 --> 31:09.420
Herr Salieri composed
this little march of welcome for you.

31:09.520 --> 31:11.520
Really?

31:13.360 --> 31:14.900
Well, there it is.
Now...

31:15.000 --> 31:16.091
Down to business. 

31:16.791 --> 31:20.220
Young man, we're going to commission 
an opera from you.

31:20.320 --> 31:22.320
What do you say?

31:23.360 --> 31:27.220
Did we vote in the end for German 
or Italian?

31:27.320 --> 31:32.420
Well actually sire, if you remember,
we did finally incline to Italian.

31:32.520 --> 31:34.520
Did we?

31:35.560 --> 31:39.725
I don't think it was really decided,
Your Majesty.

31:40.720 --> 31:43.972
German. 
Please let it be German.

31:44.072 --> 31:44.740
Why so?

31:44.840 --> 31:49.020
Because I've already found
the most wonderful libretto.

31:49.120 --> 31:51.120
Have I seen it?

31:51.760 --> 31:55.740
I don't think you have, Herr Direktor,
not yet. It's quite new.

31:55.840 --> 32:00.140
- I'll show it to you immediately, of course.
- I think you'd better.

32:00.240 --> 32:02.980
Well tell us about it.

32:03.080 --> 32:05.914
Tell us the story.

32:08.320 --> 32:11.869
Well, it's quite amusing, Majesty.

32:12.080 --> 32:16.596
It's set... 
The whole thing is set in a...

32:21.880 --> 32:24.394
Yes? Where?

32:24.600 --> 32:28.434
In a harem, Majesty. In a seraglio.

32:28.640 --> 32:32.295
- You mean in Turkey?
- Yes, exactly.

32:32.960 --> 32:37.780
Then why especially
does it have to be in German?

32:37.880 --> 32:43.180
It doesn't, especially. 
It could be in Turkish if you really want.

32:43.280 --> 32:47.820
No, my dear fellow, 
the language is not finally the point.

32:47.920 --> 32:53.380
Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate 
for a national theater?

32:53.480 --> 32:56.710
Why not? It's charming.

32:56.720 --> 33:02.511
I mean, I won't actually show concubines 
exposing their...

33:03.160 --> 33:06.580
It's not indecent.
It's highly moral, Majesty.

33:06.680 --> 33:09.460
It's full of proper German virtues.

33:09.560 --> 33:13.820
Excuse me, Majesty, 
but what do you think these could be?

33:13.920 --> 33:17.065
Being a foreigner, I'd love to learn.

33:17.200 --> 33:20.351
Well, tell him, Mozart.

33:20.600 --> 33:23.100
Name us a German virtue.

33:23.200 --> 33:26.033
- Love, sire.
- Oh, love.

33:26.240 --> 33:30.150
Of course, 
in Italy we know nothing about love.

33:33.320 --> 33:35.445
No, I don't think you do.

33:35.560 --> 33:40.060
Watching Italian opera,
all those male sopranos screeching,  

33:40.160 --> 33:46.790
stupid fat couples rolling their eyes about. 
That's not love. It's just rubbish.

33:47.120 --> 33:50.476
Majesty, you choose the language.

33:50.680 --> 33:55.140
I'll be my task to set it to the finest music 
ever offered a monarch.

33:55.240 --> 33:58.810
Well, there it is.
Let it be German.

34:00.880 --> 34:02.220
This is yours.

34:02.320 --> 34:05.020
Keep it.
It's already here in my head.

34:05.120 --> 34:08.264
What? On one hearing only?

34:08.400 --> 34:11.516
I think so, sire. Yes.

34:14.760 --> 34:16.760
Show us.

34:45.040 --> 34:48.949
The rest is just the same, isn't it?

34:51.360 --> 34:54.505
That doesn't really work, does it?

34:56.360 --> 34:58.360
Did you try...?

34:59.560 --> 35:02.460
Shouldn't it be a bit more...?

35:02.560 --> 35:04.300
Or this?

35:04.400 --> 35:06.400
This. Yes.

35:10.640 --> 35:13.785
Better? What do you think?

35:57.880 --> 36:00.474
Grazie, Signore.

36:02.760 --> 36:06.594
All I ever wanted was to sing to God.

36:06.880 --> 36:09.997
He gave me that longing...

36:10.680 --> 36:14.820
and then made me mute. 
Why?

36:14.920 --> 36:16.920
Tell me that.

36:17.800 --> 36:21.580
If he didn't want me 
to praise him with music,

36:21.680 --> 36:24.655
why implant the desire...

36:24.680 --> 36:27.740
like a lust in my body?

36:27.960 --> 36:31.190
And then deny me the talent?

36:33.960 --> 36:37.060
Madame Cavalieri is here 
for her lesson, sir.

36:37.160 --> 36:39.160
Maestro.

36:41.120 --> 36:43.120
Well...?

36:43.960 --> 36:46.554
How do you like it?

36:47.920 --> 36:49.380
It's Turkish.

36:49.480 --> 36:53.980
My hairdresser said everything this year's 
is going to be Turkish.

36:54.080 --> 36:56.080
Does he?

36:58.800 --> 37:01.837
What else did he tell you today?

37:03.920 --> 37:09.020
Come, come. 
Give me some gossip.

37:09.120 --> 37:12.860
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.

37:15.680 --> 37:18.060
News travels fast in Vienna.

37:18.400 --> 37:23.300
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. 
Is it true?

37:23.400 --> 37:26.580
- Yes.
- Is there a part in it for me?

37:26.680 --> 37:29.274
- No.
- How do you know?

37:29.480 --> 37:32.457
Do you know where it's set, my dear?

37:32.557 --> 37:33.100
Where?

37:33.200 --> 37:35.200
In a harem.

37:35.840 --> 37:39.071
- What's that?
- A brothel.

37:42.880 --> 37:44.880
Come.

37:45.360 --> 37:47.360
Let's begin.

37:47.680 --> 37:50.990
- What does he look like?
- Mozart?

37:51.200 --> 37:54.500
- You might be disappointed.
- Why?

37:54.600 --> 37:58.935
Looks and talent 
don't always go together, Katerina.

37:58.960 --> 38:01.740
Looks don't concern me, maestro.

38:01.840 --> 38:05.913
Only talent interests a woman of taste.

38:06.320 --> 38:08.550
Shall we continue?

38:44.800 --> 38:46.800
There she was.

38:48.400 --> 38:52.700
I don't know where they met or how.
There she stood.

38:52.800 --> 38:55.075
On stage, for all to see.

38:55.280 --> 38:59.159
Showing off like the greedy songbird she was.

39:30.760 --> 39:36.039
Ten minutes of ghastly scales.
Arpeggios.

39:36.240 --> 39:40.575
Whizzing up and down
like fireworks at a fairground.

39:50.240 --> 39:53.789
Understand, I was in love with the girl.

39:54.680 --> 39:56.680
Or at least in lust.

39:57.760 --> 40:01.912
And I swear to you,
I never laid a finger on her.

40:06.040 --> 40:11.300
All the same, I couldn't bear
to think of anyone else touching her.

40:11.400 --> 40:14.198
Least of all, "the creature".

41:53.560 --> 41:59.180
Brava, madame.
You are an ornament to our stage.

41:59.280 --> 42:01.280
Your Majesty.

42:03.840 --> 42:06.940
Well, Herr Mozart. A good effort.

42:07.040 --> 42:08.780
Well, decidedly that.

42:08.880 --> 42:14.725
An excellent effort.
You have shown us something quite new tonight.

42:15.120 --> 42:17.157
It is new.

42:17.360 --> 42:19.940
- It is, isn't it, sire?
- Yes, indeed.

42:20.040 --> 42:24.340
So then, you liked it?
You really liked it, sire?

42:24.440 --> 42:27.420
Well, of course I did. It's very good.

42:27.520 --> 42:31.399
Of course, now and then,
just now and then,

42:31.600 --> 42:34.235
it seemed a touch...

42:35.440 --> 42:37.340
What do you mean, sire?

42:37.440 --> 42:42.140
Well, I mean, occasionally,
it seems to have...

42:42.240 --> 42:44.549
How shall one say...?

42:47.160 --> 42:49.580
How shall one say, direktor?

42:49.680 --> 42:53.180
- Too many notes, Your Majesty?
- Exactly. Very well put.

42:53.280 --> 42:57.319
- Too many notes.
- I don't understand.

42:57.520 --> 43:01.980
There are just as many notes, Majesty, 
as I required, neither more nor less.

43:02.080 --> 43:04.740
My dear fellow, there are in fact

43:04.840 --> 43:09.855
only so many notes the ear can hear 
in a course of an evening.

43:10.280 --> 43:15.420
I think I'm right in saying that,
aren't I, court composer?

43:15.520 --> 43:18.876
Yes. On the whole, yes, Majesty.

43:19.480 --> 43:21.100
This is absurd.

43:21.200 --> 43:25.380
Young man, don't take it too hard.
Your work is ingenious.

43:25.480 --> 43:27.180
It's quality work.

43:27.280 --> 43:30.450
And there are simply too many notes,
that`s all.

43:30.550 --> 43:32.820
Just cut a few and it'll be perfect.

43:32.920 --> 43:35.780
Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?

43:35.880 --> 43:37.880
Wolfgang.

43:38.560 --> 43:41.233
Wolfgang, my dear.

43:42.840 --> 43:46.719
- Wolfgang.
- Majesty, this is Frau Weber.

43:46.920 --> 43:49.309
She's my landlady.

43:51.720 --> 43:57.113
- Enchanted, madame.
- Sire, such an honor.

44:00.520 --> 44:03.820
This is my dear daughter, Constanze.

44:03.920 --> 44:07.915
- She's the fiancée of Herr Mozart.
- Really?

44:11.840 --> 44:14.877
How charming. Please.

44:30.480 --> 44:32.480
Well...

44:32.800 --> 44:35.435
When do you marry?

44:36.880 --> 44:40.660
We haven't exactly received
my father's consent yet.

44:40.760 --> 44:44.548
Not entirely. Not altogether.

44:47.160 --> 44:51.631
- Excuse me, but how old are you?
- 26.

44:52.240 --> 44:56.540
Well, my advice is for you to marry
this charming young lady

44:56.640 --> 44:59.900
- and stay with us in Vienna.
- You see?

45:00.000 --> 45:03.100
I told him that, Your Majesty.
but he won't listen to me.

45:03.200 --> 45:06.829
Your Majesty,
you give such wonderful...

45:07.240 --> 45:11.552
such royal advice. 
May I...?

45:20.520 --> 45:23.239
Well, there it is.

45:24.280 --> 45:27.850
Wolfie, will you get some water?

45:29.440 --> 45:33.010
Will you get some water, please?

45:36.320 --> 45:38.870
Wolfie, get some water.

45:46.720 --> 45:49.695
Excuse me. Excuse me.

45:56.680 --> 45:58.680
Did you know?

45:59.760 --> 46:02.225
- What?
- The marriage.

46:04.720 --> 46:07.060
What does it matter to you?

46:07.160 --> 46:10.850
Nothing. 
He can marry who he pleases,

46:10.950 --> 46:13.245
I don't give a damn.

46:13.840 --> 46:15.876
How was I?

46:17.240 --> 46:19.280
You were sublime.

46:19.480 --> 46:23.390
And what did you think of the music?

46:23.480 --> 46:25.596
Extremely clever.

46:26.600 --> 46:28.600
Katerina, I...

46:28.760 --> 46:30.760
Excuse me.

46:31.080 --> 46:34.580
Is that woman still lying
on the floor?

46:34.680 --> 46:39.834
- No, she's fine.
- Oh, I'm so relieved.

46:40.640 --> 46:44.100
Dear Mozart,
my sincere congratulations.

46:44.200 --> 46:47.940
- Did you like it then?
- How could I not?

46:48.320 --> 46:51.900
It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today, 
don't you agree?

46:52.000 --> 46:54.992
She must be dazzling in bed.

46:57.040 --> 47:00.580
I assume she's the virtuoso
in that department.

47:00.680 --> 47:05.780
There can`t be any other reason 
why you'd marry someone like that.

47:05.880 --> 47:07.880
Come in.

47:10.000 --> 47:13.740
Excuse me.
Wolfie, Mom isn't feeling very well.

47:13.840 --> 47:15.540
- Can we go home, now?
- Yes.

47:15.640 --> 47:18.860
No, no, no.
You can't take him away now.

47:18.960 --> 47:21.599
This is his night.

47:21.800 --> 47:24.380
Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?

47:24.480 --> 47:28.390
Excuse us, Fraulein.
Good night, signore.

47:29.480 --> 47:34.395
At that moment I knew,
beyond any doubt,

47:34.600 --> 47:36.600
he'd had her.

47:36.800 --> 47:40.540
The creature had had my darling girl.

47:47.520 --> 47:50.155
It was incomprehensible.

47:50.600 --> 47:53.160
What was God up to?

47:54.440 --> 47:57.670
Was it possible I was being tested?

47:58.480 --> 48:02.917
Was God expecting me to offer forgivenes,

48:03.120 --> 48:05.900
in the face of every offense?

48:06.000 --> 48:08.720
No matter how painful?

48:09.920 --> 48:11.920
It's very possible.

48:12.280 --> 48:14.396
But why him?

48:15.240 --> 48:16.816
Why choose Mozart

48:16.916 --> 48:20.980
to teach me lessons in humility?

48:21.080 --> 48:22.900
My heart was filling up

48:23.000 --> 48:26.995
with such hatred for that little man.

48:27.720 --> 48:31.140
For the first time in my life,
I began to know

48:31.240 --> 48:33.240
really...

48:33.520 --> 48:35.556
violent thoughts.

48:36.680 --> 48:41.549
Every day, sometimes for hours,
I would pray.

48:42.800 --> 48:44.800
Lord...

48:45.400 --> 48:47.400
please...

48:47.960 --> 48:49.780
send him away,

48:49.880 --> 48:52.519
back to Salzburg.

48:54.280 --> 48:56.475
For his sake...

48:57.240 --> 48:59.629
as well as mine.

49:01.480 --> 49:05.500
- No. I won't have him back.
- But, Your Grace...

49:05.600 --> 49:10.754
Your son is an unprincipled,
spoiled, conceited brat.

49:12.080 --> 49:14.080
Yes, sir,

49:14.760 --> 49:16.830
that is the truth.

49:18.240 --> 49:23.140
But don't blame him.
The fault is mine, entirely.

49:23.240 --> 49:26.300
I was too indulgent with him.

49:26.680 --> 49:29.433
Please, Your Grace?

49:30.200 --> 49:33.380
Give him one more chance?

49:33.480 --> 49:35.869
You have leave to try.

49:36.080 --> 49:40.073
God bless, Your Grace.
I thank Your Grace.

49:40.280 --> 49:42.280
I thank you.

49:45.720 --> 49:50.020
I write to you with urgent news.
I'm coming to Vienna.

49:50.120 --> 49:53.940
Take no further steps towards marriage 
until we meet.

49:54.040 --> 49:58.100
As you honor the father 
who has devoted his entire life to yours,

49:58.200 --> 50:01.260
do as I bid and await my coming.

50:13.920 --> 50:18.540
I now join you
in the holy bonds of matrimony.

50:18.640 --> 50:21.420
Those whom God hath joined together,

50:21.520 --> 50:24.432
let no man put asunder.

50:37.440 --> 50:38.860
Most beloved father:

50:38.960 --> 50:44.340
Remember how you always told me Vienna is the city of musicians.
To conquer here is to conquer Europe.

50:44.440 --> 50:48.180
With my wife I can do it.
One day soon, when I'm wealthy man,

50:48.280 --> 50:52.190
you'll come and live with us,
and we'll be so happy.

51:01.600 --> 51:05.380
Good morning court composer.
This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth.

51:05.480 --> 51:06.780
Your Highness.

51:06.880 --> 51:10.180
She's asked me to advise her  
in a suitable musical instructor.

51:10.280 --> 51:13.980
- I think I've come up with an excellent idea.
- Your Majesty.

51:14.080 --> 51:16.980
It would be such a tremendous honor.

51:17.080 --> 51:21.670
I was thinking of Herr Mozart.
What is your view?

51:22.640 --> 51:26.125
It's an interesting idea,
Majesty, but...

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
Yes?

51:29.000 --> 51:32.276
My concern is to protect you

51:32.480 --> 51:36.305
from any hint of favoritism.

51:40.600 --> 51:42.140
Favoritism.

51:42.240 --> 51:44.860
- What is this, Herr Chamberlain?
- What is what?

51:44.960 --> 51:48.446
Why must I submit samples of my work
to some stupid committee

51:48.546 --> 51:50.660
just to teach a thirteen-year-old girl?

51:50.760 --> 51:53.399
Because His Majesty wishes it.

51:54.440 --> 51:56.820
Is the emperor angry with me?

51:56.920 --> 51:58.138
Quite the contrary.

51:58.238 --> 52:01.260
Then why doesn`t he simply appoint me 
to the post?

52:01.360 --> 52:04.540
Mozart, you are not 
the only composer in Vienna.

52:04.640 --> 52:07.791
No. But I'm the best.

52:08.680 --> 52:10.680
Mozart.

52:11.720 --> 52:15.885
A little modesty might suit you better.

52:22.040 --> 52:24.260
Who is on this committee?

52:24.360 --> 52:28.900
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini-Rosenberg 
and, of course, court composer Salieri.

52:29.000 --> 52:33.675
Naturally, the Italians.
Of course, always the Italians.

52:33.800 --> 52:36.690
They're all musical idiots.

52:37.120 --> 52:41.156
And you want them to judge my music?

52:41.256 --> 52:44.500
Young man,
the issue is quite simple.

52:44.600 --> 52:46.540
If you want this position,

52:46.640 --> 52:50.980
you must submit your stuff,
along with all your colleagues.

52:51.080 --> 52:53.080
Must I?

52:54.320 --> 52:56.100
Well, I won't.

52:56.200 --> 52:58.835
How are we supposed to live, Wolfie?

53:00.120 --> 53:02.940
Do you want me to go 
in the streets and beg?

53:03.040 --> 53:05.040
Don't be stupid.

53:05.720 --> 53:08.740
- All they want to see is your work.
- Shit.

53:08.840 --> 53:13.550
- What's wrong with that?
- Shut up. Just shut up.

53:13.760 --> 53:17.980
One royal pupil,
and all of Vienna will come flocking.

53:18.080 --> 53:20.375
They'll come anyway.

53:20.720 --> 53:24.205
- No, they won't.
- They love me here.

53:24.400 --> 53:30.435
- I know how things work in this city.
- You always know everything, don't you?

53:56.360 --> 53:58.060
- Yes?
- Excuse me, sir.

53:58.160 --> 54:01.100
- There is a lady who insists on talking to you.
- Who is she?

54:01.200 --> 54:04.600
She didn't say,
but she says it's urgent.

54:06.720 --> 54:09.525
Excuse me, my dear.

54:13.320 --> 54:15.320
Your Excellency.

54:16.600 --> 54:18.716
How can I help you?

54:23.520 --> 54:24.266
Frau Mozart?

54:24.366 --> 54:27.500
I've come on behalf of my husband.

54:27.600 --> 54:30.980
I brought you some samples of his work,

54:31.080 --> 54:34.460
so he can be considered 
for the royal appointment.

54:34.560 --> 54:36.081
How charming,

54:36.181 --> 54:39.980
but why did he not come himself?

54:40.080 --> 54:42.878
Well, he's terribly busy, sir.

54:46.200 --> 54:48.200
I understand.

54:49.920 --> 54:53.100
I will look at them of course, 
the moment I can.

54:53.200 --> 54:54.396
It will be an honor.

54:54.496 --> 54:57.500
Please give him my warmest regards.

54:57.600 --> 55:01.980
Would it be too much trouble, sir,
to ask you to look at them now?

55:02.080 --> 55:05.700
- While I wait.
- I'm afraid I'm not at leisure

55:05.800 --> 55:08.340
this precise moment.

55:08.440 --> 55:13.020
Just leave them with me.
I assure you, they will be quite safe.

55:13.120 --> 55:16.078
I really cannot do that, sir.

55:16.720 --> 55:20.205
You see, he doesn't know I'm here.

55:21.680 --> 55:24.035
Then he didn't send you?

55:24.240 --> 55:27.755
No, sir. This was my own idea.

55:30.040 --> 55:33.589
- I see.
- Sir, we're desperate.

55:34.520 --> 55:37.478
We really need this job.

55:37.680 --> 55:41.220
My husband spends far more
than he can ever earn.

55:41.320 --> 55:45.580
I don't mean that he's lazy because he`s not at all, 
he works all day long.

55:45.680 --> 55:49.912
It's just that he's not practical.

55:50.280 --> 55:55.550
Money simply slips through his fingers. 
It's ridiculous.

55:57.240 --> 55:59.980
Let me offer you some refreshment.

56:00.080 --> 56:02.630
Do you know what these are?

56:03.920 --> 56:07.405
Capezzoli di Venere.
Nipples of Venus.

56:08.200 --> 56:13.060
They're Roman chestnuts in brandied sugar. 
Try one. Go on, try one.

56:13.160 --> 56:15.594
They're quite surprising.

56:20.240 --> 56:22.240
They're wonderful.

56:24.000 --> 56:26.980
Thank you very much,
Your Excellency.

56:27.080 --> 56:29.970
Don't keep calling me that.

56:30.400 --> 56:33.375
Keeps me at such a distance.

56:33.640 --> 56:36.780
I wasn't born a court composer,
you know.

56:36.880 --> 56:39.020
I'm from a small town.

56:39.120 --> 56:41.156
Just like your husband.

56:43.520 --> 56:46.273
Are you sure you can't leave this 

56:46.480 --> 56:50.220
and come back again?

56:51.120 --> 56:53.918
It's very tempting, sir.

56:54.120 --> 56:57.580
But it's impossible, I'm afraid.

56:57.680 --> 57:00.820
Wolfgang would be frantic
if he found those were missing.

57:00.920 --> 57:03.639
You see, they're all originals.

57:04.520 --> 57:09.110
- Originals?
- Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.

57:19.000 --> 57:20.820
These...

57:20.920 --> 57:22.920
are originals?

57:57.320 --> 57:59.140
Astounding.

57:59.240 --> 58:02.555
It was actually... It was beyond belief.

58:03.320 --> 58:05.834
These were first and only

58:06.440 --> 58:08.476
drafts of music.

58:09.720 --> 58:15.078
But they showed no corrections of any kind. 
Not one.

58:17.800 --> 58:20.951
He had simply written down music,

58:21.160 --> 58:23.993
already finished in his head.

58:24.280 --> 58:29.559
Page after page of it.
As if he were just taking dictation.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
And music...

58:38.360 --> 58:42.355
finished as no music is ever finished.

58:44.960 --> 58:47.520
Displace one note,

58:47.880 --> 58:51.540
and there would be diminishment.

58:51.640 --> 58:55.805
Displace one phrase,
and the structure would fall.

58:59.240 --> 59:01.674
It was clear to me.

59:02.200 --> 59:06.140
That sound I had heard
in the archbishop's palace

59:06.240 --> 59:09.073
had been no accident.

59:09.880 --> 59:14.670
Here again was the very voice of God.

59:18.680 --> 59:21.380
I was staring through the cage

59:21.480 --> 59:25.220
of those meticulous ink strokes,

59:26.280 --> 59:30.114
at an absolute beauty.

59:44.880 --> 59:47.189
Is it not good?

59:51.720 --> 59:53.760
It is miraculous.

59:56.960 --> 01:00:01.192
Yes, he's very proud of his work.

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:05.590
So you will help us?

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:10.620
I dine with the emperor
tomorrow evening.

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:14.140
One word from me and the post is his.

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:17.385
Thank you, Your Excellency.
Thank you.

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:19.595
Come back tonight.

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:23.155
- Tonight?
- Alone.

01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:27.640
What for?

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:32.310
Some service deserves service in return.

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:35.600
No?

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:40.680
- What do you mean?
- Isn't it obvious?

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:44.191
It's a post all Vienna seeks.

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:48.580
If you wish it for your husband,
come tonight.

01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:51.380
I'm a married woman, sir.

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:53.480
Then don't.

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:55.600
It's up to you.

01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:59.270
And not to be vague,
that is the price.

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:13.997
There is no God of mercy, Father.

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:18.998
Just a God of torture.

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:26.920
Evening came.

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:32.680
I sat there, 
not knowing whether she would return or not.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.676
I prayed as I had never prayed before.

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:40.790
Dear God...

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.275
enter me now.

01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:47.917
Fill me with one piece of true music.

01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:53.220
One piece with your breath in it,
so I know that you love me.

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:59.157
Show me one sign of your favor,
and I will show mine to Mozart.

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:03.759
I will get him the royal position.

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:05.940
Enter me.

01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:08.040
Please.

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:11.270
Please.

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:19.680
Yes?

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:25.599
That lady is back, sir.

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:31.840
Show her in.

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:05.240
Well?

01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:08.360
I'm here.

01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:14.871
My husband has gone to a concert.

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:18.393
He didn't think I would enjoy it.

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:31.393
Well, where shall we go?

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:35.199
Should we stay here?

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:38.680
Well...

01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:44.870
Do you still want to look at these?

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:50.905
Or don't we need to bother anymore?

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.798
Suppose we don't, really.

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:51.735
Show this woman out.

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:14.080
Stanzi.

01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:17.160
Stanzi.

01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:24.520
What is it?

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:29.365
What's the matter?
Tell me.

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:33.760
Tell me.

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:40.950
I love you.

01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:43.995
I love you.

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:48.770
From now on, we are enemies.

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:50.620
You and I.

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:53.540
Because you choose for your instrument

01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:58.270
a boastful, lustful, smutty, 
infantile boy,

01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:04.555
and give me for reward only the ability 
to recognize the incarnation.

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:07.633
Because you are unjust...

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
unfair...

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:12.670
unkind...

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:14.700
I will block you.

01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:16.800
I swear it.

01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:20.740
I will hinder and harm 
your creature on earth,

01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:23.070
as far as I`am able.

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:26.940
Majesty, I don't like to talk 
against a fellow musician.

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:28.580
Of course not.

01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:30.796
I have to tell you.

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:36.780
Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone 
with young ladies.

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:38.920
Really?

01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:42.900
As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils,
a very young singer,

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.060
Maria Theresa Paradis,

01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:47.625
told me she was...

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:50.916
Well...

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:54.990
Well, what?

01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:57.995
Molested, Majesty.

01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:02.110
Twice, in the course of the same lesson.

01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:10.430
Sir, there is a Herr Mozart
waiting for you in the salon.

01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:16.940
- Whom did they choose?
- Herr Zummer.

01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:19.040
Herr Zummer?

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:22.820
But the man's a fool.
He's a total mediocrity.

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:27.596
No, no. 
He has yet to achieve mediocrity.

01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:33.479
I can't lose this post.
I simply can't.

01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:36.720
Excellency, please.

01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:40.780
Let's go to the palace.
And you can talk to the emperor

01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:44.980
and tell him that Herr Zummer
is an awful choice.

01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:48.100
He could actually do musical harm 
to the Princess Elizabeth.

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:50.939
Between you and me, 
no one in the world

01:07:51.039 --> 01:07:55.459
could do musical harm 
to the Princess Elizabeth.

01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:58.900
Look...

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.860
I must have pupils.

01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:04.060
Without pupils, I can't manage.

01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:07.580
You don't mean to tell me
that you're living in poverty?

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:10.877
No, but I'm broke.

01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:13.180
Well, how is this possible?

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:16.380
You give concerts, don`t you?
I hear they`re quite successful.

01:08:16.479 --> 01:08:19.392
They're stupendously successful.

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:23.300
You can't get a seat.
The only trouble is no one will hire me.

01:08:23.399 --> 01:08:25.220
They want to hear me play,

01:08:25.319 --> 01:08:31.609
but they won't let me teach their daughters, 
as if I was some kind of a fiend.

01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:36.920
Seriously,

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:40.859
is there any chance
you could manage a loan?

01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:45.100
Only for six months.
Eight, at the most.

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:49.420
You expect your fortunes to change
in six or eight months?

01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:52.325
As a matter of fact, I do.

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:55.665
I`am working on something that is

01:08:55.765 --> 01:08:58.060
going to explode like a bomb shell 
all over Europe.

01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:03.340
After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna.
I'll pay you back double. Anything.

01:09:03.439 --> 01:09:05.460
You name the terms.

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:07.595
Well, how exciting.

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:10.215
Tell me more.

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:12.973
I better not,
it's a bit of a secret.

01:09:13.073 --> 01:09:15.660
Come, come, Mozart,
I'm interested.

01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:18.564
This is delicious. What is it?

01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:21.979
It's cream cheese mixed with 
granulated sugar,

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:26.380
suffused with rum.
Crema Mascarpone Speciale.

01:09:26.479 --> 01:09:28.100
Italian.

01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:32.660
Forgive me. 
We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.

01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:34.580
Two thou...

01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:38.036
Two hundred florins.
That's all I need.

01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:41.880
A hundred.

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:45.600
Fifty.

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:49.071
What exactly are you working on?

01:09:51.439 --> 01:09:54.671
Really, I can't say.

01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:59.149
I don't think you should become known

01:09:59.249 --> 01:10:01.799
in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart.

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:09.760
However...

01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:12.240
However, I know a very 
distinguished gentleman

01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:13.960
I can recommend to you.

01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:15.960
And he has a daughter.

01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:22.400
Quiet. Quiet.

01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:24.600
Herr Mozart.

01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:28.460
Welcome. Pay no attention, they're impossible.
Just ignore them.

01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:32.340
I treat them just like my own children.

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:37.115
Which of them do you wish me to teach?

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:40.670
That's funny.

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:43.993
You're a funny fellow.

01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:48.620
This is the instrument, Herr Mozart,
I hope it's to your satisfaction.

01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:51.740
Of course it'll be to his satisfaction.

01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:56.100
Come, we're going to listen to some music. 
Come.

01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:58.200
Good boy.

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:05.060
Now.

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:10.020
Please play me something,
just to give me an idea.

01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:12.236
Anything will do.

01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:14.860
Just go ahead.

01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:17.758
Just as if we weren't here.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:23.860
Part of music, getting used to an audience. 
Am I right, Herr Mozart?

01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:27.460
Perhaps it would be better
if we were left alone.

01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:29.600
I think we're both a little shy.

01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:30.980
Play.

01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:34.152
- I said play.
- Michael, please.

01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:38.860
Perhaps if I would play something first,
it might encourage the Fraulein.

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:41.935
Why don't you let me try the instrument?

01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:51.458
Stop it. Stop.

01:11:51.558 --> 01:11:54.420
He always howls when he hears music.

01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:57.340
We've got to break him of that habit.

01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:00.860
We've got to break them of their habit.

01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:02.540
Play. Please.

01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:06.713
Herr Mozart, play. Please, I beg you.

01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:15.876
That's it. That's it.

01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:20.915
Keep playing.

01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:29.518
Keep playing. That's it.

01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:51.277
Mozart, that's wonderful.
Wonderful.

01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:55.056
Well, next time you wish me 
to instruct another one of your dogs, 

01:12:55.156 --> 01:12:56.260
please let me know.

01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:58.070
Goodbye, Fraulein.
Goodbye, madam.

01:12:58.071 --> 01:12:58.970
Goodbye, sir.

01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:56.760
Papa?

01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:02.200
Papa.

01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:07.720
Why are you here?

01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:09.500
Am I not welcome?

01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:14.955
Of course, welcome.
Papa, welcome. Welcome.

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:38.380
You're very thin.
Doesn't she feed you, that wife of yours?

01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:43.580
Feed? Of course she feeds me.
She stuffs me like a goose all day long.

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:47.340
- Is she not here?
- No, she had to help her mother.

01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:49.260
Yes, she's like that.

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:53.950
Her mother's a very sweet woman, 
you'Il...

01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:02.872
I didn't know you were home.

01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:06.445
Stanzi, this is my father.

01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:11.590
We'll wait. We'll wait.

01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:17.435
Why don't you get up now,
my darling?

01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:26.900
She's very tired, poor creature.
You know me. I'm such a pig.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.460
It's not easy cleaning up after me.

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:32.660
Don't you have a maid?

01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:36.309
Oh. No. We could if we wanted,

01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:40.685
but Stanzi wouldn`t hear it,
she insists on doing everything herself.

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:43.270
How is your...

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:46.429
financial situation?

01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:48.680
Couldn't be better.

01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:51.480
That's not what I hear.

01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:54.620
What do you mean?
It's wonderful.

01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:59.340
Really, it's marvelous.
People love me here.

01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:02.079
They say you have debts.

01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:04.440
Who?

01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:06.440
Who says that?

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:08.860
That's a malicious lie.

01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:11.076
Do you have pupils?

01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:14.518
I don't want pupils.

01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:17.069
They get in the way.

01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:21.100
I have to have time for composition.

01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:24.100
Composition doesn't pay.
You know that.

01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:26.200
That one will.

01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:28.680
What's that?

01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:31.620
It's a secret.

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:35.800
Secret?
You don't have secrets from me.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:41.300
No. Please. I don't want you to see it.
I don't want anyone to see it.

01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:43.460
But you are going to be 
so proud of me, Papa.

01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:48.830
It`s going to be the best thing that I've ever done. 
The best thing anyone...

01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:51.500
There she is.

01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:55.700
Look at her. Isn't she beautiful?
Come on now, Papa, confess it.

01:16:55.800 --> 01:17:00.475
- Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter?
- Stop it, Wolfie.

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:03.076
I look dreadful.

01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:05.780
Are you...

01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:07.950
expecting?

01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:09.265
Yes, I`am.

01:17:09.365 --> 01:17:12.780
Isn't it marvelous?
We're delighted.

01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:17.220
- May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?
- Who wants tea? Let's go out.

01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:21.060
This calls for a feast.
You don't want tea, do you Papa?

01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:25.380
I know. Let's go dancing.
Papa loves parties, don't you?

01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:28.710
How can you be so boring? Tea.

01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:34.660
Come on, Papa. Hurry.

01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:36.760
Here we go. Good day.

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:19.360
Now.

01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:28.717
I name the penalty.
I name the penalty.

01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:32.153
And the penalty is...

01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:36.273
- Give her a good one.
- Show us your legs.

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:43.115
Come on, come on.

01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:57.310
It's just a game, Papa.

01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:11.520
Thank you.

01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:40.755
Herr Mozart, why don't you name 
your son's penalty? 

01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:43.872
Yes, Papa. Name it.

01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:48.610
Name it. 
I'll do anything you say. Anything.

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:53.620
I want you to come back 
to Salzburg with me, my son.

01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:57.220
The rule is you can only give me a penalty 
that can be performed in the room.

01:19:57.320 --> 01:19:59.460
I'm tired of this game.
I don`t wanna play anymore.

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:03.917
But my penalty.
I've got to have a penalty.

01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:10.390
I name a penalty.

01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:14.900
The penalty is,

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.220
you shall play our little tune

01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:21.757
in the manner of
Johann Sebastian Bach.

01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:50.620
- Turn him over.
- Over? 

01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:54.879
Now you play it backwards.

01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:25.580
- Another one. Give me another one.
- Play it like Gluck.

01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:28.319
- Boring. Another.
- Handel.

01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:31.260
I don't like him. Another one.

01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:33.476
Play Salieri.

01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:37.940
Now that is a challenge.
That is a challenge.

01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:40.719
Please. Please.

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:16.593
Go on. Mock me. Laugh.

01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:24.220
That was not Mozart laughing, Father.

01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:25.980
That was God.

01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:31.350
That was God laughing at me
through that obscene giggle.

01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:36.230
Go on, Signore. Laugh.

01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:40.360
Show my mediocrity for all to see.

01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:44.393
One day I will laugh at you.

01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:50.158
Before I leave this earth...

01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:53.033
I will laugh at you.

01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:16.480
- Wolfie?
- What?

01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:20.380
There's a young girl here to see you.

01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:22.020
What does she want?

01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:27.305
She won't talk to me.
She says she has to speak to you.

01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:29.840
Damn.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
Yes?

01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:40.185
- Are you Herr Mozart?
- That's right.

01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:45.340
My name is Lorl, sir.
I'm a maidservant.

01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:49.340
I was asked to come here
and offer my services to you.

01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:54.500
They'll be paid for, by a great admirer of yours 
who wishes to remain...

01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:56.600
anonymous.

01:23:57.120 --> 01:23:59.873
Is this your idea, Papa?

01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:02.100
Mine?

01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:07.140
- Are you playing a trick on me?
- I've never seen this girl in my life.

01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:10.820
- Is this some kind of joke?
- Not at all, sir.

01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:13.300
Young woman, this won't do at all.

01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:17.740
My son cannot possibly accept such an offer,
no matter how generous,

01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:22.260
- unless he knows who's behind it.
- But I really can't tell you that, sir.

01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:25.540
- This is ridiculous.
- What is ridiculous?

01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:28.340
Wolfie has many admirers in Vienna.

01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:31.180
They love him here.
People send us gifts all the time.

01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:34.300
You cannot possibly accept her 
without references.

01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:37.340
Well, this is none of your business.

01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:41.140
- Whoever sent you is going to pay?
- That's right, ma'am.

01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:45.540
Splendid. Now we're going
to let a perfect stranger into our house.

01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:49.295
Who is we? Who is letting who...?

01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:55.980
- Could you please wait outside?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:57.460
Look, old man.

01:24:57.560 --> 01:25:01.980
We spend a fortune on you,
and all you can do is criticize from morning to night.

01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:03.380
- And now...
- Stanzi.

01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:07.900
No. It's right that he should hear.
I'm sick to death of it.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:11.460
We can't do anything right for you, 
can we?

01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:15.340
You won't have to do anything for me 
ever again.

01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:17.140
I'm leaving.

01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:20.340
- No, Papa.
- Don`t worry, I won't stay here to be a burden to anyone.

01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:22.440
No one calls you that.

01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:25.790
She does. She says I sleep all day.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
And so you do.

01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:32.140
The only time you come out is to eat.

01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:34.620
Well, what do you expect?

01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:41.260
Do you expect anyone to walk out 
into a mess like this every day?

01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:46.060
- So now I'm a bad housekeeper.
- So you are. This place is like a pigsty all day.

01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:48.276
When can you start?

01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:51.710
- Right away, ma'am.
- Good.

01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:19.279
They're out every night, sir.

01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:23.560
Thank you, sir.

01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:27.610
Do any pupils come to the house?

01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:31.040
Not that I've seen.

01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:34.345
Then how does he pay for all this?

01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:37.070
Does he work at all?

01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:42.957
Yes, sir. All day long. 
He never leaves the house till evening.

01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:46.180
He just sits there,
writing and writing.

01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:48.280
Really?

01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:51.575
What is it he's writing?

01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:56.794
I wouldn't know that, sir.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.820
Of course not.

01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:00.920
You're a good girl.

01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:03.420
You're very kind to do this.

01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:10.360
The next time you're sure 
they'll be out of the house, let me know.

01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:17.034
Thank you, sir.

01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:56.235
I think I found out about the money, sir.

01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:58.674
Yes? What?

01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:04.020
He kept seven snuffboxes in here.
I could swear they were all gold.

01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:06.120
And now look.

01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:08.316
There's only one left.

01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:11.669
Where does he work?

01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:15.270
In there, sir.

01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:04.420
Gentlemen, I've just heard some news
that may be of interest you.

01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:05.580
What?

01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:09.878
Mozart is writing a new opera.
An Italian opera.

01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:12.430
Italian?

01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:17.665
That's not all.
He has chosen for his subject, Figaro.

01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:20.513
The Marriage of Figaro.

01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:24.290
He's setting that play to music?

01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:26.520
Yes.

01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:30.230
What is this Marriage of Figaro?

01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:33.925
It's a French play, Kapellmeister.

01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:37.140
It has been banned by the emperor.

01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:39.450
You're absolutely sure?

01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:44.870
Herr Mozart.

01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:48.095
Gentlemen, sit down.

01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:54.440
Mozart.

01:30:55.240 --> 01:30:59.420
Are you aware that I have declared
the French play of Figaro

01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:02.325
unsuitable for our theater?

01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:05.220
Yes, sire.

01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:11.525
Yet we hear you're making an opera from it. 
Is this true?

01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:15.980
Who told you this, Majesty?

01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:20.551
It is not your place to ask questions.
Is it true?

01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:22.760
Yes, I...

01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:25.275
I admit it is.

01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:30.000
Would you tell me why?

01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:34.140
Majesty, it is only a comedy.

01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:37.020
What you think, Herr Mozart, 
is scarcely the point.

01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:40.715
It's what His Majesty thinks that counts.

01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:43.040
But, Your Majesty...

01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:45.200
Mozart...

01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:47.420
I`am a tolerant man.

01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:52.705
I do not censor things lightly.
When I do, I have good reason.

01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:55.958
Figaro is a bad play.

01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:59.260
It stirs up hatred between the classes.

01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:02.380
In France, it has caused nothing but bitterness.

01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:07.700
My own dear sister, Antoinette, writes me that 
she is beginning to be frightened of her own people.

01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:11.340
Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, 
there's nothing like that in the piece.

01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:16.260
I've taken out everything that could give offense. 
I hate politics.

01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:18.900
I'm afraid you're rather innocent, my friend.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:24.020
In these dangerous times I cannot afford 
to provoke our nobles or our people,

01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:26.460
simply over a theater piece.

01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:31.395
Majesty, this is just a frolic.
Is a piece about love.

01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:33.600
"Love". Again.

01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:35.580
And it's new.

01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:39.660
It's entirely new.
So new, the people will go mad for it.

01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:41.910
I have scenes...

01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:45.140
The end of the second act, for example.

01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:49.180
It starts out as a simple duet.
Just a husband and a wife quarreling.

01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:52.615
Suddenly, the wife scheming little maid comes in.

01:32:52.715 --> 01:32:54.300
It's a very funny situation.

01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:56.260
Duet turns into trio.

01:32:56.360 --> 01:32:59.220
Then the husband's valet comes in.
He`s plotting with the maid.

01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:01.140
Trio turns into quartet.

01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:04.180
Then a stupid old gardener comes in.
Quartet becomes quintet.

01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:06.280
And so on, on and on.

01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:08.868
Sextet, septet, octet.

01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:12.820
How long do you think I can sustain that, Majesty?

01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:14.940
I have no idea.

01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:17.040
Guess.

01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:18.780
Guess, Your Majesty.

01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:24.380
Imagine the longest time such a thing could be sustained, 
and then double it.

01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:26.480
Well...

01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:29.040
Six...

01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:32.015
seven minutes?

01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:38.820
- Eight minutes?
- Twenty, sire. Twenty minutes.

01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:41.315
Twenty minutes of continuous music.

01:33:41.415 --> 01:33:43.420
No recitatives.

01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:45.985
Sire, only opera can do this.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:49.860
In a play, if more than one person 
speaks at the same time it´s...

01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:51.960
just noise, 
no one can`t understand a word.

01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:54.580
But with opera, with music...

01:33:54.680 --> 01:33:58.780
with music, you can have 20 individuals,
all talking at the same time.

01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:02.060
And it's not noise.
It's a perfect harmony.

01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:05.260
Mozart, music is not the issue here.

01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:10.540
No one doubts your talent. 
It's your judgment of literature that's in question.

01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:16.540
Even with the politics taken out,
this thing it would still remain a vulgar farce.

01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:19.460
Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?

01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:23.540
Surely you can choose 
more elevated themes.

01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:26.780
Elevated.
What does that mean, elevated?

01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:31.475
I`am fed to the teeth 
with all these elevated things. 

01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:33.825
Old dead legends.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:38.060
Why must we go on forever
writing only about gods and legends?

01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:40.160
Because they do.

01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:42.949
They go on forever.

01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:47.675
At least what they represent:
The eternal in us.

01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:50.420
Opera is here to ennoble us, Mozart.

01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:55.110
You and me,
just the same as His Majesty.

01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:02.275
"Bello, bello, bello".
Come on now, be honest.

01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:07.900
Which one of you would rather listen to your hairdresser
than Hercules, or Horatius or Orpheus.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:12.540
People so lofty, 
they sound as if they shit marble.

01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:14.640
What?

01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:18.519
Govern your tongue, Mozart.
How dare you.

01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:25.519
Forgive me, Majesty.

01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:29.100
I'm a vulgar man.

01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:33.535
But I assure you, my music is not.

01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:38.832
You are passionate, Mozart.

01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:42.828
But you do not persuade.

01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:48.915
Sire, the whole opera is finished.

01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:52.460
Do you know how much work
went into it?

01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:57.680
His Majesty has been
more than patient, Signore.

01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:02.020
How can I persuade Your Majesty
if you won´t let me show it?

01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:05.032
That will do, Herr Mozart.

01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:09.700
Just let me tell you how it begins.

01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:12.385
May I just do that, Majesty?

01:36:12.485 --> 01:36:16.310
Show you how it begins?
Just that?

01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:20.800
Please.

01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:23.080
Look...

01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:26.500
There's a servant down on his knees.
And do you know why?

01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:29.980
Not from any oppression, no,
because he's measuring a space.

01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:32.120
And do you know what for?

01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:34.834
His bed. His wedding bed.

01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:37.235
To see if it will fit.

01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:47.520
Late.

01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:50.780
Late.

01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:52.540
On the beat.

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:54.640
Good.

01:36:56.200 --> 01:36:58.200
Yes.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Early.

01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:13.275
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.

01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:21.815
In that case, gentlemen, I think...

01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:28.725
I think we should help Mozart all we can.

01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:34.620
And do our best to protect him 
against the emperor's anger.

01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:36.720
What anger?

01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:38.870
About the ballet.

01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:41.790
What ballet?

01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:44.310
Excuse me but,

01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:50.680
didn't His Majesty specifically forbid 
the ballet in his opera?

01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:27.350
- Herr Mozart.
- Yes?

01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:30.660
- A word with you, please.
- Certainly, Herr Direktor.

01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:32.800
Now, Herr Mozart.

01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:35.340
Five minutes, please.

01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:37.440
Five minutes.

01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:39.620
Yes?

01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:45.340
Do you not know that His Majesty 
has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?

01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:50.150
- Yes but this is not a ballet, this is a dance of Figaro`s wedding.
- Exactly, a dance.

01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:54.940
Surely, His Majesty didn't mean prohibit a dance
when it's part of the story, Herr Direktor.

01:38:55.040 --> 01:39:01.245
It's dangerous to interpret His Majesty edicts. 
Give me your score, please.

01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:10.800
Thank you.

01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:16.460
What are you doing, Herr Direktor?

01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:20.300
Taking out what you should
never have put in.

01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:23.714
Please. Please.

01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:26.630
I have no one else to turn to.

01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:29.300
- What is it?
- It's unbelievable.

01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:33.500
The direktor has actually torn up
a huge section of my music.

01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:36.745
They say I have to rewrite the opera.

01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:39.669
But it's perfect as it is.

01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:41.180
I can't...

01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:43.748
rewrite what's perfect.

01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:46.900
Please.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.275
Can't you talk to him?

01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:51.060
Please.

01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:53.940
Why bother with Rosenberg?
He's obviously no friend of yours.

01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:59.395
I could kill him.
I mean, really. Kill him.

01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:03.580
I actually threw the entire score into the fire, 
he made me so angry.

01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:09.715
- You burned the score?
- No, my wife took it out in time.

01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:12.280
Thank God.

01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:19.275
It's not fair that a man like that
should have power over our work.

01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:23.610
But there are those
who have power over him.

01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:28.365
I think I'll take this up
with the emperor.

01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:30.820
Excellency...

01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:32.920
would you?

01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:36.525
With all my heart, Mozart.

01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:39.909
Thank you.

01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:45.050
Please, Herr Mozart.
"Please, it's not a holy relic".

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:51.660
I don't need to tell you I said nothing, 
whatever, to the emperor.

01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:57.285
I went to the theater ready 
to tell Mozart something, anything.

01:40:57.720 --> 01:41:02.236
When suddenly,
in the middle of the third act

01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:05.670
to my astonishment, the emperor,

01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:10.100
who never attended rehearsals,
suddenly appeared.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.036
What is this?

01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:34.400
I don't understand.

01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:37.280
Is it modern?

01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:39.420
Majesty...

01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:41.260
the Herr Direktor,

01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:44.260
he has removed un balletto

01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:48.638
that would have occurred at this place.

01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:51.180
Why?

01:41:51.280 --> 01:41:53.460
It is your regulation, sire.

01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:56.472
No ballet in your opera.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
Salieri.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Do you like this?

01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:12.589
It's not a question of liking, Majesty.

01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:16.455
Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.

01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:19.610
Well, look at them.

01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:24.672
No. This is nonsense.

01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:27.146
Let me see the scene with the music.

01:42:27.246 --> 01:42:28.860
But, sire.

01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:30.460
Oblige me.

01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:32.560
Yes, Majesty.

01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:44.460
Can we see the scene with the music back, please?

01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:48.215
Certainly. Certainly, Herr Direktor.

01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:56.265
Bring the palace set back in, please.

01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:34.020
The restored third act

01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:36.429
was bold, brilliant.

01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:39.240
The fourth...

01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:43.520
was astounding.

01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:52.620
I saw a woman,

01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:58.380
disguised in her maid's clothes,
hear her husband speak the first

01:43:58.480 --> 01:44:01.860
tender words he has offered her in years.

01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:06.476
Simply because he thinks
she is someone else.

01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:12.353
I heard the music of true forgiveness
filling the theater,

01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:17.150
conferring on all who sat there,
perfect absolution.

01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:20.740
God was singing through this little man,

01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:23.274
to all the world.

01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:25.880
Unstoppable.

01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:31.159
Making my defeat more bitter
with every passing bar.

01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:11.115
And then, do you know what happened?

01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:15.480
A miracle.

01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:23.420
With that yawn,

01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:27.308
I saw my defeat turn into a victory.

01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:34.785
And Mozart was lucky
the emperor yawned only once.

01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:36.300
Three yawns...

01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:39.420
and the opera would fail the same night.

01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:42.920
Two yawns, within a week at most.

01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:47.675
With one yawn, 
the composer could still get...

01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:54.020
Nine performances. Nine.
That's all it's had. And withdrawn.

01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:56.315
I know, I know.

01:45:56.560 --> 01:45:58.560
It's outrageous.

01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:03.620
Still, if the public doesn't like one's work,

01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:06.260
one has to accept the fact gracefully.

01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:09.675
But what is it that they don't like?

01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:12.180
I can speak for the emperor.

01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:13.590
You make too many demands

01:46:13.690 --> 01:46:15.460
on the royal ear.

01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:18.128
The poor man can't concentrate 
for more than an hour.

01:46:18.228 --> 01:46:20.308
You gave him four.

01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:28.580
What did you think of it yourself?

01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:31.069
Did you like it at all?

01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:35.220
I thought it was marvelous.

01:46:35.320 --> 01:46:38.890
Of course.
It's the best opera yet written.

01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:41.120
I know it.

01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:46.035
Why didn't they come?

01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:51.460
I think you overestimate
our dear Viennese, my friend.

01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:55.020
Do you know you didn't even give them 
a good bang at the end of songs,

01:46:55.120 --> 01:46:58.100
to let them know when to clap.

01:46:58.200 --> 01:47:00.555
I know, I know.

01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:04.980
Maybe you should give me some lessons in that.

01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:07.469
I wouldn't presume.

01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:13.500
Nevertheless, at the risk of imposing...

01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:17.255
I'd like you to see my new piece.

01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:19.900
It would be a tremendous honor for me.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:23.315
No, the honor would be all mine.

01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:47.200
I believe...

01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:49.940
I believe

01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:54.630
it is the best opera yet written, 
my friends.

01:48:55.840 --> 01:48:57.840
Salieri.

01:48:58.760 --> 01:49:02.740
You are the brightest star
in the musical firmament.

01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:06.240
You do honor to Vienna and to me.

01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:33.720
Herr Mozart.

01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:37.060
- It was good of you to come.
- How could I not?

01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:39.160
Bravo, maestro.

01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:42.965
Did my work please you?

01:49:44.240 --> 01:49:48.745
I never knew that music like that 
was possible.

01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:51.794
- You flatter me.
- No.

01:49:52.680 --> 01:49:54.955
One hears such sounds...

01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:58.436
and what can one say but: 
Salieri.

01:50:05.520 --> 01:50:07.940
Everybody's here and we've got guests.

01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:10.980
Bravo. 
Well, I've got some more.

01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:14.780
Stanzi, you remember my excellent friend Schikaneder. 
Come in.

01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:16.220
Don't be shy.

01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:20.359
- This is a very nice girl, and this...
- Wolfie?

01:50:21.320 --> 01:50:23.320
Yes, my love?

01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:27.302
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.

01:50:27.402 --> 01:50:28.260
Salzburg?

01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:31.420
We were just talking about Salzburg.

01:50:33.320 --> 01:50:35.709
Your father is dead.

01:50:57.240 --> 01:50:59.708
So rose the dreadful ghost,

01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:04.112
from his next and blackest opera.

01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:13.500
There on the stage,
stood the figure of a dead commander.

01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:15.220
I knew.

01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:17.100
Only I understood,

01:51:17.200 --> 01:51:20.500
that the horrifying apparition
was Leopold,

01:51:20.600 --> 01:51:23.235
raised from the dead.

01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:54.500
Wolfgang had actually summoned up 
his own father,

01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:58.170
to accuse his son before all the world.

01:51:59.440 --> 01:52:01.440
It was...

01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:04.716
terrifying and wonderful to watch.

01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:08.200
And now...

01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:16.365
the madness began in me.

01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:22.460
The madness of a man splitting in half.

01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:27.500
Through my influence, I saw to it.

01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:31.420
Don Giovanni was played
only five times in Vienna.

01:53:31.520 --> 01:53:35.957
But, in secret,
I went to every one of those five.

01:53:36.160 --> 01:53:40.870
Worshiping sound I alone seemed to hear.

01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:29.125
And as I stood there,
understanding how

01:54:29.160 --> 01:54:32.700
that bitter old man 
was still possessing his poor son,

01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:35.520
even from beyond the grave,

01:54:35.600 --> 01:54:37.540
I began to see a way,

01:54:37.640 --> 01:54:39.460
a terrible way,

01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:42.500
I could finally triumph

01:54:42.600 --> 01:54:44.600
over God.

01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:48.600
Herr Mozart?

01:57:51.080 --> 01:57:55.300
I have come to commission
work from you.

01:57:55.400 --> 01:57:59.598
- What work?
- A Mass for the dead.

01:57:59.800 --> 01:58:01.800
What dead?

01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:04.080
Who is dead?

01:58:04.280 --> 01:58:06.597
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass

01:58:06.697 --> 01:58:07.860
and never got one.

01:58:08.960 --> 01:58:12.460
- Who are you?
- I`am only a messenger.

01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:14.676
Do you accept?

01:58:14.960 --> 01:58:17.269
You will be well paid.

01:58:24.520 --> 01:58:26.670
Do you accept?

01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:38.340
Work fast.

01:58:38.440 --> 01:58:41.180
And be sure tell no one what you do.

01:58:41.280 --> 01:58:44.170
You will see me again soon.

01:59:18.640 --> 01:59:20.640
Wolfie?

01:59:30.760 --> 01:59:33.479
My plan was so simple...

01:59:34.480 --> 01:59:37.115
that it terrified me.

01:59:38.880 --> 01:59:43.215
First, I must get the death Mass,
and then...

01:59:44.560 --> 01:59:47.535
I must achieve his death.

01:59:48.920 --> 01:59:50.920
What?

01:59:51.280 --> 01:59:53.316
His funeral.

01:59:54.120 --> 01:59:55.460
Imagine it.

01:59:55.560 --> 01:59:58.660
The cathedral,
all Vienna sitting there.

01:59:58.760 --> 02:00:03.880
His coffin.
Mozart's little coffin in the middle.

02:00:04.520 --> 02:00:06.520
And then...

02:00:06.800 --> 02:00:08.950
in that silence...

02:00:11.040 --> 02:00:13.040
music.

02:00:14.160 --> 02:00:16.355
A divine music,

02:00:16.560 --> 02:00:19.535
bursts out over them all.

02:00:19.960 --> 02:00:23.509
A great Mass of death.

02:00:24.760 --> 02:00:28.548
Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart.

02:00:28.760 --> 02:00:32.833
Composed by his devoted friend,

02:00:33.240 --> 02:00:35.879
Antonio Salieri.

02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:38.540
What sublimity.

02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:41.108
What depth.

02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:44.278
What passion in the music.

02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:48.714
Salieri has been touched by God at last,

02:00:48.920 --> 02:00:51.434
and God forced to listen.

02:00:52.840 --> 02:00:56.230
Powerless to stop it.

02:00:56.440 --> 02:01:00.435
I, for once, in the end,
laughing at him.

02:01:06.880 --> 02:01:11.100
The only thing that worried me
was the actual killing.

02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:13.475
How does one do that?

02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:17.090
How does one kill a man?

02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:20.040
It's one thing

02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:22.540
to dream about it.

02:01:22.640 --> 02:01:25.757
Very different when you...

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.275
When you have to do it...

02:01:32.760 --> 02:01:35.069
with your own hands.

02:01:44.200 --> 02:01:46.873
Come in.

02:01:57.760 --> 02:02:06.151
Don Giovanni,
I've come to dinner.

02:02:06.360 --> 02:02:09.140
Dinner. Are you mad?
I'm a nobleman.

02:02:09.240 --> 02:02:12.660
I only ever dine with people 
of my own height.

02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:14.760
Stop it.

02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:17.120
Be careful. Be careful.

02:02:17.360 --> 02:02:20.113
Hold tight.

02:02:20.600 --> 02:02:22.750
I'm a famous

02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:25.633
horseman.

02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:29.958
And we're a famous horsy.

02:02:31.920 --> 02:02:35.708
Give me a hoof, my darling.

02:02:35.920 --> 02:02:40.869
And I'll give you my heart.

02:02:41.080 --> 02:02:45.392
Take me to your stable.

02:02:45.600 --> 02:02:48.751
And never more we'll part.

02:02:55.560 --> 02:02:58.472
Kill me. Kill me.

02:03:18.920 --> 02:03:23.550
We're going to make a soprano stew.

02:03:23.760 --> 02:03:28.231
We're going to make a soprano stew.

02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:32.035
And when you make a soprano stew.

02:03:32.240 --> 02:03:34.240
Shut up.

02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:37.470
I'm sick to death of that tune.

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:58.436
Give me some hay, my darling.

02:03:58.680 --> 02:04:02.070
And I'll give you my heart.

02:04:02.280 --> 02:04:04.575
Leporello. Some hay.

02:04:53.200 --> 02:04:55.200
We hope

02:04:55.400 --> 02:04:59.439
you're contented.

02:05:00.640 --> 02:05:03.154
With what

02:05:03.360 --> 02:05:07.353
we've presented.

02:05:08.160 --> 02:05:14.554
And love our dove of peace...

02:05:38.720 --> 02:05:41.460
- What did you think of that?
- It was wonderful.

02:05:41.560 --> 02:05:45.725
- He liked the little people. Didn`t you?
- It's all in good fun.

02:05:46.720 --> 02:05:48.870
I liked the horse.

02:05:59.360 --> 02:06:03.180
I tell you, 
if you played Don Giovanni here,

02:06:03.280 --> 02:06:06.220
you would've had a wonderful success.

02:06:06.320 --> 02:06:08.100
You belong here.

02:06:08.200 --> 02:06:12.340
Not at the snobby court.
You could do anything you like.

02:06:12.440 --> 02:06:17.140
The more fantastic, the better.
That's what people want: Fantasy.

02:06:17.240 --> 02:06:20.420
You write a proper part for me,

02:06:20.520 --> 02:06:22.820
a couple of catchy songs.

02:06:22.920 --> 02:06:27.118
I guarantee you a triumph deluxe.

02:06:27.720 --> 02:06:32.480
- What do you say?
- How much will you pay him?

02:06:33.520 --> 02:06:37.940
Well. I see you brought
your manager with you.

02:06:38.760 --> 02:06:40.900
Well, madame,

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:44.037
how about half the receipts?

02:06:44.440 --> 02:06:46.060
Half the receipts.

02:06:46.160 --> 02:06:48.500
- Stanzi.
- I'm talking about now.

02:06:48.600 --> 02:06:50.949
How much will you pay him now?

02:06:51.049 --> 02:06:52.020
Down payment.

02:06:52.120 --> 02:06:54.120
Down payment?

02:06:55.080 --> 02:06:59.260
Who do you think I`am,
the emperor?

02:06:59.360 --> 02:07:00.980
I have to go.

02:07:01.080 --> 02:07:04.310
Stay here, you'll enjoy this next one.

02:07:05.560 --> 02:07:06.980
You not going to do this.

02:07:07.080 --> 02:07:09.460
- Why not? Half the house.
- When?

02:07:09.560 --> 02:07:13.540
We need money now. 
Either he pays you now, or you don't do it.

02:07:13.640 --> 02:07:15.300
I don't trust that man.

02:07:15.400 --> 02:07:18.980
And I don't like what he did with your opera. 
It was common.

02:07:19.080 --> 02:07:22.140
Wll, you liked it. Didn`you?
Monkey, punky, flunky.

02:07:22.160 --> 02:07:23.740
Half the house.

02:07:23.840 --> 02:07:27.860
You'll never see a penny.
I want it here in my hand.

02:07:27.960 --> 02:07:31.475
- I'll put it here in your hand.
- Shut up.

02:07:31.680 --> 02:07:36.580
You won't put a thing in my hand
until I see some money.

02:07:36.680 --> 02:07:39.126
It's embarrassing. 
Can't you think of anyone 

02:07:39.226 --> 02:07:41.620
who could do something for him?

02:07:41.720 --> 02:07:45.715
I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause, baron.

02:07:46.040 --> 02:07:50.220
He has succeeded in alienating practically 
the whole of Vienna.

02:07:50.320 --> 02:07:52.220
He never pays his debts.

02:07:52.320 --> 02:07:56.300
I can't think of anyone
to whom I'd dare recommend him.

02:07:56.400 --> 02:08:00.473
Herr Mozart. What a surprise.

02:08:01.560 --> 02:08:03.755
What can I do for you?

02:08:05.040 --> 02:08:10.740
Is my pupil still interested
in learning the art of music?

02:08:10.840 --> 02:08:12.791
Your pupil is married

02:08:12.891 --> 02:08:15.940
and living in Mannheim, young man.

02:08:16.040 --> 02:08:18.040
Really?

02:08:22.960 --> 02:08:28.700
Perhaps your dear wife might care
to profit from my instruction.

02:08:28.800 --> 02:08:30.995
What is it, Mozart?

02:08:31.200 --> 02:08:33.860
What's the matter with you?

02:08:33.960 --> 02:08:35.540
Well,

02:08:35.640 --> 02:08:40.380
since it appears no one is eager 
to hire my services...

02:08:40.480 --> 02:08:44.090
could you favor me
with a little money instead?

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
What for?

02:08:49.880 --> 02:08:54.215
If a man cannot earn, 
he must borrow.

02:08:57.120 --> 02:09:00.265
That's hardly the way to go about it.

02:09:00.960 --> 02:09:04.191
You are right, sir. You are right.

02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:08.780
But you see, I`am endowed with talent, 
and you with money.

02:09:08.880 --> 02:09:10.820
If I offer mine...

02:09:10.920 --> 02:09:13.480
you should offer yours.

02:09:16.520 --> 02:09:18.590
I'm sorry, no.

02:09:21.280 --> 02:09:23.280
Please.

02:09:24.680 --> 02:09:27.148
My answer is no, Mozart.

02:09:33.120 --> 02:09:35.120
Please.

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.070
Please!

02:10:16.440 --> 02:10:18.476
Don't answer it.

02:10:20.280 --> 02:10:22.280
Why?

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
Tell him...

02:10:26.720 --> 02:10:29.140
Tell him I'm not here.

02:10:29.240 --> 02:10:31.240
Tell him...

02:10:32.040 --> 02:10:35.340
Tell him I'm working on it.

02:10:35.440 --> 02:10:37.476
Come back later.

02:10:52.960 --> 02:10:55.703
Am I interrupting something?

02:10:55.803 --> 02:10:55.940
No.

02:10:56.040 --> 02:10:58.759
Good. Where's our friend?

02:10:58.960 --> 02:11:00.960
He's not here.

02:11:01.360 --> 02:11:05.500
But he's working on it,
he told me to tell you.

02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:07.600
Is that it?

02:11:13.080 --> 02:11:15.469
Is he happy with it?

02:11:18.360 --> 02:11:21.340
What's this? 
A Requiem Mass?

02:11:21.440 --> 02:11:24.447
You think I'm in the funeral business?

02:11:24.547 --> 02:11:25.580
Leave that alone.

02:11:25.680 --> 02:11:30.100
- Put it down. It's nothing for you.
- I'm sorry.

02:11:30.240 --> 02:11:33.020
What have you got for me?

02:11:33.120 --> 02:11:35.120
Finished?

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:40.471
- What?
- The vaudeville, what do you think?

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:42.740
Yes.

02:11:42.840 --> 02:11:44.910
- Can I see it?
- No.

02:11:46.320 --> 02:11:48.100
Why not?

02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:50.835
Because there's nothing to see.

02:11:58.720 --> 02:12:00.720
Look...

02:12:01.120 --> 02:12:07.070
I asked you if we could start rehearsals next week 
and you said yes.

02:12:08.120 --> 02:12:12.710
- Well, we can.
- So let me see it. Where is it?

02:12:13.080 --> 02:12:15.080
Here.

02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:20.980
It's all right here in my noodle.
The rest is just scribbling.

02:12:21.080 --> 02:12:25.160
Scribbling and bibbling.
Bibbling and scribbling.

02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:30.100
- Do you like a drink?
- Look, you little cunt!

02:12:30.200 --> 02:12:32.860
Do you know how many people I've hired?

02:12:32.960 --> 02:12:35.460
- Leave him alone!
- I'm paying this people! Do you realize that?

02:12:35.560 --> 02:12:39.780
- He's doing his best.
- I`m paying this people to wait. For you it's ridiculous!

02:12:39.880 --> 02:12:43.340
You know what's ridiculous?
Your libretto, that what's ridiculous!

02:12:43.440 --> 02:12:46.580
Only an idiot would ask Wolfie
to work on that stuff!

02:12:46.680 --> 02:12:49.220
Twelve-foot snakes, magic flutes?

02:12:49.320 --> 02:12:52.180
What's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?

02:12:52.280 --> 02:12:55.078
Money. Money.

02:12:57.880 --> 02:12:59.880
You're mad.

02:13:00.200 --> 02:13:01.900
She's mad Wolfie.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:05.993
- Oh, yes?
- Wolfie, write it down.

02:13:06.200 --> 02:13:08.200
Just write it down.

02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:10.240
On paper.

02:13:10.440 --> 02:13:17.500
It's no use to anybody in your head.
To hell with your death mass!

02:13:18.040 --> 02:13:20.820
Calm yourself.
What's the matter with you?

02:13:20.920 --> 02:13:25.180
- I won't work there anymore.
- Why, what has happened?

02:13:25.280 --> 02:13:28.192
You don't know what it's like.

02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:31.460
Herr Mozart frightens me.

02:13:31.520 --> 02:13:33.340
He drinks all day,

02:13:33.440 --> 02:13:37.100
then takes all that medicine
and it makes him worse.

02:13:37.200 --> 02:13:39.200
Is he working?

02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:43.420
Oh, I`am frightened, sir, really.

02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:48.535
- When he speaks, he doesn`t make any sense.
- Is he working?

02:13:50.040 --> 02:13:52.190
I suppose so.

02:13:52.720 --> 02:13:57.300
He sits there all the time,
doing some silly opera.

02:13:57.400 --> 02:14:00.540
- Opera?
- Please, don't ask me to go back again.

02:14:00.640 --> 02:14:03.860
I'm frightened.
I'm very, very frightened!

02:14:03.960 --> 02:14:06.997
Are you sure it's an opera?

02:15:46.320 --> 02:15:48.788
I don't have it yet.

02:15:49.320 --> 02:15:52.720
Are you neglecting my request?

02:15:52.960 --> 02:15:55.952
No. No, I...

02:15:56.760 --> 02:15:58.955
I promise you...

02:15:59.160 --> 02:16:03.580
I'll give you a wonderful piece,
the best I ever...

02:16:06.600 --> 02:16:09.797
This is my wife, Stanzi.

02:16:10.320 --> 02:16:13.900
I've been sick,
but I'm all right now, aren't I?

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.125
Yes, sir. He's all right.

02:16:16.200 --> 02:16:19.192
And he's working on it very hard.

02:16:20.360 --> 02:16:23.980
Give me two more weeks. Please.

02:16:24.080 --> 02:16:28.198
The sooner you finish,
the greater your reward.

02:16:28.440 --> 02:16:30.440
Work.

02:16:38.920 --> 02:16:40.920
Wolfie.

02:16:42.600 --> 02:16:46.000
I think you really are going mad.

02:16:47.080 --> 02:16:51.580
You work like a slave for that idiot actor
who won't give you a penny.

02:16:51.680 --> 02:16:54.352
And here, this is not a ghost.

02:16:54.559 --> 02:16:59.490
This is a real man,
who puts down real money.

02:17:00.320 --> 02:17:03.379
Why on earth won't you finish it?

02:17:04.120 --> 02:17:08.625
Can you give me one reason
I can understand?

02:17:09.760 --> 02:17:11.796
It's killing me.

02:17:15.559 --> 02:17:17.940
You're drunk, aren't you?

02:17:17.959 --> 02:17:21.955
Be honest, tell me.
You've been drinking.

02:17:23.559 --> 02:17:28.111
It's not fair.
I worry about you all the time.

02:17:28.559 --> 02:17:31.790
I do everything I can to help you.

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:36.299
And all you do is drink
and talk nonsense, and frighten me.

02:17:36.400 --> 02:17:38.789
Go back to bed.

02:17:47.680 --> 02:17:49.680
Please.

02:17:50.280 --> 02:17:53.989
Let me...
Let me sit here.

02:17:56.879 --> 02:17:59.684
Let me stay here with you.

02:20:26.200 --> 02:20:28.980
I did it.
And I was proud to do it.

02:20:29.080 --> 02:20:32.980
"Leave." I said. 
"Right away. Clear out and take the child with you.

02:20:33.080 --> 02:20:37.500
Here is the money and go to the spa 
and get your health back." I was shocked.

02:20:37.600 --> 02:20:40.380
Shocked to my foundation when I saw her.

02:20:40.480 --> 02:20:43.780
I couldn't believe my eyes,
poor little thing.

02:20:43.880 --> 02:20:47.300
You monster.
No one exists but you, do they?

02:20:47.400 --> 02:20:50.060
You and your music. I warned her.

02:20:50.160 --> 02:20:52.980
"Choose a man, not a baby" I said.

02:20:53.080 --> 02:20:56.170
"You marry him, you won't have a pot
to piss in." 

02:20:56.270 --> 02:20:58.140
You selfish thing.

02:20:58.240 --> 02:21:00.655
Selfish, that's what you are.

02:21:00.755 --> 02:21:04.835
Simply selfish. 
Do you hear me?

02:24:36.920 --> 02:24:38.260
Pick him up.

02:24:38.360 --> 02:24:40.360
Pick him up.

02:24:41.920 --> 02:24:44.380
Be careful. Come with me.

02:24:44.480 --> 02:24:46.480
You, follow me.

02:25:12.680 --> 02:25:16.195
- Is it over?
- Yes, it's over. It's over.

02:25:17.600 --> 02:25:19.600
Go.

02:25:59.160 --> 02:26:01.160
Go, go. Go.

02:26:01.800 --> 02:26:03.800
Go. Go.

02:26:31.320 --> 02:26:33.320
Where is your wife?

02:26:36.240 --> 02:26:38.595
Where is your wife?

02:26:40.840 --> 02:26:44.799
She's not well either.
She went to the spa.

02:26:46.160 --> 02:26:48.625
You are so good to me.

02:26:48.880 --> 02:26:51.792
Truly. Thank you.

02:26:52.240 --> 02:26:54.240
Please, please.

02:26:54.680 --> 02:26:58.660
No, I mean to come to my opera.

02:26:58.760 --> 02:27:04.030
You, you are the only colleague of mine 
who came.

02:27:06.400 --> 02:27:08.400
Mozart.

02:27:09.280 --> 02:27:13.300
I would never miss anything
you had written.

02:27:13.400 --> 02:27:16.676
- It's just a vaudeville.
- No, no.

02:27:16.880 --> 02:27:19.260
It's a sublime piece.

02:27:19.960 --> 02:27:22.340
The grandest operone.

02:27:30.760 --> 02:27:32.760
I tell you...

02:27:32.920 --> 02:27:37.850
you are the greatest composer
known to me.

02:27:40.600 --> 02:27:42.725
Do you mean it?

02:27:47.640 --> 02:27:49.680
- It's him.
- Who?

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
The man.

02:27:52.080 --> 02:27:54.080
He's here.

02:27:56.720 --> 02:27:58.780
Tell him to go away.

02:27:58.880 --> 02:28:03.700
Tell him I'm still working on it.
Don't let him in.

02:28:03.800 --> 02:28:05.950
No, no. Wait.

02:28:06.160 --> 02:28:07.675
Ask him if he would give me...

02:28:07.775 --> 02:28:10.100
some money now.

02:28:10.200 --> 02:28:15.640
Tell him if he would,
it will help me to finish it.

02:28:31.760 --> 02:28:33.990
- Salieri?
- Yes.

02:28:35.800 --> 02:28:40.220
- Can we come in?
- Better not. He's sleeping.

02:28:40.320 --> 02:28:44.180
- He's all right, though?
- Yes, he's just exhausted.

02:28:44.280 --> 02:28:47.272
He became dizzy, that's all.

02:28:47.480 --> 02:28:51.361
Well, tell him we came by, 
won't you?

02:28:51.461 --> 02:28:52.140
Of course.

02:28:52.240 --> 02:28:55.555
Give him this. That's his share.

02:28:56.120 --> 02:28:58.820
- That should cheer him up.
- Indeed.

02:28:58.920 --> 02:29:02.320
And now, good night to you all.
It was...

02:29:02.400 --> 02:29:04.400
perfection, truly.

02:29:04.440 --> 02:29:06.440
Thank you.

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
What happened?

02:29:25.840 --> 02:29:28.400
He said to give you this.

02:29:29.240 --> 02:29:33.065
And if you finish by tomorrow night,

02:29:33.280 --> 02:29:36.700
he will pay you another hundred ducats.

02:29:36.800 --> 02:29:38.800
Another...?

02:29:39.080 --> 02:29:42.650
That's too soon. Tomorrow night...

02:29:43.680 --> 02:29:45.680
It's impossible.

02:29:48.760 --> 02:29:51.718
- Did he say a hundred?
- Yes.

02:29:57.080 --> 02:29:59.080
It's too soon.

02:30:01.120 --> 02:30:04.120
Can I...?
Could I help you?

02:30:07.640 --> 02:30:09.640
Would you?

02:30:12.975 --> 02:30:14.747
Actually you could.

02:30:21.720 --> 02:30:24.188
- I wanna go.
- Where?

02:30:24.480 --> 02:30:27.597
- I wanna go back to Vienna.
- Now?

02:30:27.800 --> 02:30:29.800
- Yes.
- Why?

02:30:31.640 --> 02:30:33.640
I feel wrong.

02:30:34.800 --> 02:30:37.189
I feel wrong being here.

02:30:39.960 --> 02:30:43.540
- Where did I stop?
- The end of the Recordare.

02:30:43.640 --> 02:30:45.680
So now Confutatis...

02:30:51.800 --> 02:30:54.180
How would you translate that?

02:30:54.280 --> 02:30:57.850
"Consigned to flames of woe".

02:30:59.080 --> 02:31:01.885
- Do you believe in it?
- What?

02:31:02.880 --> 02:31:06.793
A fire which never dies,
burning you forever.

02:31:08.080 --> 02:31:10.080
Oh, yes.

02:31:10.920 --> 02:31:12.920
Possible.

02:31:14.120 --> 02:31:17.900
- Come, let's begin.
- We ended in F major.

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:21.197
- Yes.
- So, now, A minor.

02:31:28.680 --> 02:31:31.592
- A minor.
- Yes.

02:31:34.320 --> 02:31:37.198
Confutatis. A minor.

02:31:39.400 --> 02:31:41.400
Start with the voices.

02:31:41.440 --> 02:31:44.700
- Basses first. Second beat of the...
- Time?

02:31:44.800 --> 02:31:49.460
Common time.
Second beat of the first measure.

02:31:49.560 --> 02:31:51.560
On A.

02:31:53.240 --> 02:31:56.020
Second measure, second beat.

02:31:56.120 --> 02:31:57.420
You see?

02:31:57.520 --> 02:31:59.340
- Yes. G-sharp?
- Of course.

02:31:59.440 --> 02:32:03.265
Second beat of the third measure, 
on E.

02:32:09.280 --> 02:32:13.190
Do you have me?
Show me.

02:32:30.480 --> 02:32:32.948
Good. Good.

02:32:33.160 --> 02:32:34.780
Now the tenors.

02:32:34.880 --> 02:32:38.790
Fourth beat of the first measure, 
on C.

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:43.276
Second measure, fourth beat. D.

02:32:45.480 --> 02:32:47.860
- All right?
- Yes, continue.

02:32:47.880 --> 02:32:51.790
Second beat of the fourth measure, 
on F.

02:32:57.520 --> 02:33:01.460
Now the orchestra. 
Second bassoon and bass trombones, with the basses.

02:33:01.560 --> 02:33:04.450
Identical notes and rhythm.

02:33:06.960 --> 02:33:11.550
First bassoon, tenor trombones,
with the tenors.

02:33:15.720 --> 02:33:19.315
- You go too fast.
- Do you have it?

02:33:19.520 --> 02:33:22.700
- First bassoon to the trombone what?
- With the tenors.

02:33:22.800 --> 02:33:26.180
- Identical?
- Of course, the instruments doubling the voices.

02:33:26.280 --> 02:33:29.900
Now, trumpets and timpani. Trumpets in D. 
Listen to me.

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.355
- I don't understand.
- Listen.

02:33:32.560 --> 02:33:34.034
Trumpets in D, tonic and dominant.

02:33:34.134 --> 02:33:35.700
First and third beats.

02:33:37.800 --> 02:33:40.520
It goes with the harmony.

02:33:45.920 --> 02:33:48.195
Yes. Yes, yes.

02:33:56.960 --> 02:33:59.340
I understand. And that's all?

02:33:59.440 --> 02:34:02.780
No, now for the real fire.
Strings in unison.

02:34:02.880 --> 02:34:05.519
Ostinato, on A. Like this:

02:34:08.200 --> 02:34:10.750
Next measure is rising.

02:34:11.880 --> 02:34:15.195
Do you have it? Show me.

02:34:21.440 --> 02:34:24.398
- It's wonderful.
- Yes, yes. Go on.

02:34:30.880 --> 02:34:33.090
- Write that down.
- Yes, yes.

02:34:36.800 --> 02:34:39.700
"Call me among the blessed".

02:34:39.800 --> 02:34:41.460
C major.

02:34:41.560 --> 02:34:46.320
Sopranos and altos in thirds.
Altos on C, sopranos above.

02:34:58.240 --> 02:35:01.020
Sopranos up to F on the second voca?

02:35:01.120 --> 02:35:06.558
And on dictus. 
And underneath, just violins. Arpeggios.

02:35:07.080 --> 02:35:10.420
Descending scale in eighth notes,
then back to ostinato again.

02:35:10.520 --> 02:35:12.700
- And that`s it. Do you have it?
- You go too fast.

02:35:12.800 --> 02:35:17.220
- Do you have it?
- You go too fast. One moment, please, one moment!

02:35:19.720 --> 02:35:24.990
Good. Show me the whole thing
from the beginning.

02:37:21.640 --> 02:37:24.105
Do you want to rest a bit?

02:37:24.360 --> 02:37:27.080
No, I'm not tired at all.

02:37:32.080 --> 02:37:34.820
We'll stop for a moment.

02:37:34.920 --> 02:37:39.900
- Then we'll finish the Lacrimosa.
- I can keep going. I assure you.

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:44.590
Will you stay with me
while I sleep a little?

02:37:44.840 --> 02:37:47.135
I'm not leaving you.

02:37:54.160 --> 02:37:56.625
I'm so ashamed.

02:37:57.640 --> 02:37:59.640
Of what?

02:38:00.080 --> 02:38:02.389
I was foolish.

02:38:02.600 --> 02:38:07.615
I thought you did not care for my work, 
or me.

02:38:10.520 --> 02:38:12.520
Forgive me.

02:38:16.800 --> 02:38:18.800
Forgive me.

02:39:14.240 --> 02:39:16.595
What are you doing here?

02:39:18.720 --> 02:39:21.792
Your husband took sick.

02:39:22.880 --> 02:39:25.685
I brought him home.

02:39:26.480 --> 02:39:28.480
Why you?

02:39:29.280 --> 02:39:33.105
Because, madame, I was at hand.

02:39:36.040 --> 02:39:40.120
Well, thank you very much.
You can go now.

02:39:41.600 --> 02:39:43.780
He needs me, ma'am.

02:39:43.880 --> 02:39:45.880
No, he doesn't.

02:39:45.880 --> 02:39:49.793
And I don't want you here.
Just go, please.

02:39:50.480 --> 02:39:54.560
- He asked me to stay.
- And I'm ask...

02:40:22.160 --> 02:40:24.160
I'm back.

02:40:27.120 --> 02:40:30.095
I missed you so much.

02:40:33.480 --> 02:40:35.480
If you'd just...

02:40:36.600 --> 02:40:40.170
show me that you need me.

02:40:45.160 --> 02:40:48.277
And I'll try to do better too.

02:40:59.560 --> 02:41:01.560
What is this?

02:41:04.360 --> 02:41:08.558
No, Wolfie, not this. Not this.

02:41:12.080 --> 02:41:15.675
You're not to work on this ever again.

02:41:16.720 --> 02:41:18.720
I've decided.

02:41:22.120 --> 02:41:24.680
This is not his handwriting.

02:41:26.360 --> 02:41:28.360
It's mine.

02:41:29.040 --> 02:41:31.335
I was assisting him.

02:41:32.200 --> 02:41:35.300
He's not to work on this anymore.

02:41:35.400 --> 02:41:38.800
- It's making him ill.
- But...

02:41:40.200 --> 02:41:42.270
Good night.

02:41:44.680 --> 02:41:49.180
I regret we have no servants
to show you out, Herr Salieri.

02:41:49.280 --> 02:41:52.220
Please respect my wish and go.

02:41:52.320 --> 02:41:54.140
Madame...

02:41:54.240 --> 02:41:56.674
I will respect his.

02:45:51.120 --> 02:45:53.839
Your merciful God.

02:45:57.000 --> 02:46:02.180
He destroyed his own beloved,
rather than let a mediocrity

02:46:02.280 --> 02:46:06.445
share in the smallest part
of his glory.

02:46:07.480 --> 02:46:09.480
He killed Mozart.

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:12.740
And kept me alive to torture.

02:46:12.840 --> 02:46:15.020
Thirty-two years of torture.

02:46:15.120 --> 02:46:17.241
Thirty-two years of slowly

02:46:17.341 --> 02:46:20.660
watching myself become extinct.

02:46:20.760 --> 02:46:22.910
My music...

02:46:23.120 --> 02:46:25.120
growing fainter.

02:46:25.160 --> 02:46:27.879
All the time fainter,

02:46:28.080 --> 02:46:30.878
till no one plays it at all.

02:46:31.800 --> 02:46:33.800
And his...

02:46:34.840 --> 02:46:39.500
Good morning, professor.
Time for the water closet.

02:46:39.600 --> 02:46:44.780
Then we have your favorite breakfast.
Sugar rolls. He loves those.

02:46:44.880 --> 02:46:47.440
Fresh sugar rolls.

02:46:47.640 --> 02:46:50.105
I will speak for you, Father.

02:46:50.240 --> 02:46:53.620
I speak for all mediocrities
in the world.

02:46:53.720 --> 02:46:56.460
I`am their champion.

02:46:56.560 --> 02:46:59.195
I`am their patron saint.

02:47:09.120 --> 02:47:11.873
Mediocrities everywhere.

02:47:13.280 --> 02:47:15.669
I absolve you.

02:47:17.360 --> 02:47:19.360
I absolve you.

02:47:20.160 --> 02:47:22.469
I absolve you.

02:47:24.760 --> 02:47:27.274
I absolve you.

02:47:27.960 --> 02:47:30.872
I absolve you all.
