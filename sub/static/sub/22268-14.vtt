with some happy news.

00:03.786 --> 00:05.744
Jane and Rafael
were finally together.

00:05.788 --> 00:08.486
And even more exciting? Jane
had a writing breakthrough.

Our relationship.

agreed to costar.

I didn't think she'd say yes,

Jane Ramos, aka J.R.

Only problem? It was a onetime thing.

was having a hard time

As for surgery,
you have some choices.

You can have a
lumpectomy, a mastectomy,

about J.R. is,

24:43.046 --> 24:46.485
And this is one

34:10.918 --> 34:13.747
and I realized
some things.

34:13.790 --> 34:17.272
And you're the only one
I want to talk about it with.

34:17.316 --> 34:19.144
Really?

34:19.187 --> 34:21.276
You've been leaning
on Jane so much.

34:21.320 --> 34:24.758
I know. Because that's
what I've always done.

34:24.801 --> 34:28.283
But that's part
of what I realized.

34:28.327 --> 34:30.111
Things are different now.

34:30.155 --> 34:31.939
I'm different.

34:31.982 --> 34:33.332
How do you mean?

34:33.375 --> 34:36.900
Well... [sighs]

34:36.944 --> 34:40.252
For most of my life,
I've been a single mother,

34:40.295 --> 34:42.993
leading with my body.

34:45.996 --> 34:49.522
It's how I attracted men.

34:49.565 --> 34:53.134
It's where most of my
confidence came from.

34:53.178 --> 34:56.224
It's how I defined myself.

34:59.880 --> 35:02.883
[sniffles]
And it's hard...

35:02.926 --> 35:05.190
to let those pieces
of me go.

35:05.233 --> 35:07.322
[exhales]

35:07.366 --> 35:10.412
Because it feels like
I'm giving up myself.

35:16.636 --> 35:20.292
But then I realized...

35:20.335 --> 35:22.294
none of what defined me before

35:22.337 --> 35:25.471
defines me now.

35:25.514 --> 35:28.604
I'm a wife.

35:28.648 --> 35:31.129
Your wife.

35:31.172 --> 35:35.002
You are...

35:35.045 --> 35:36.917
my wife.

35:40.529 --> 35:44.185
And if I go through
with the double mastectomy,

35:44.229 --> 35:46.796
my sex appeal may change.

35:48.668 --> 35:51.453
And that's why I wanted to come
to this decision with you,

35:51.497 --> 35:55.283
because even though
it's my body,

35:55.327 --> 35:57.677
it's our life.

35:57.720 --> 36:02.072
Look, I believe sexiness
is a state of mind.

36:02.116 --> 36:04.292
I know.

36:04.336 --> 36:07.121
But, practically...

36:09.950 --> 36:12.561
...things will feel
different...

36:12.605 --> 36:15.782
for you, for me.

36:17.871 --> 36:19.525
Can we talk about that?

36:19.568 --> 36:22.963
I would love to.

36:29.535 --> 36:32.538
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which brings us here, now.

36:32.581 --> 36:33.756
Can I talk to you?

36:33.800 --> 36:37.020
I just need you to know

36:37.064 --> 36:38.544
I'm sorry for pushing.

36:38.587 --> 36:40.981
Of course
it's your choice.

36:41.024 --> 36:42.939
My feelings totally
set aside.

36:42.983 --> 36:46.160
Whatever you decide,
I am in favor of.

36:46.204 --> 36:47.770
Thanks, hon.

36:49.337 --> 36:52.253
Oh.
And I get it.

36:52.297 --> 36:54.386
I mean, we've functioned
like a unit for so long,

36:54.429 --> 36:57.519
I turn to you first.

36:57.563 --> 36:59.217
But I have to look
to my husband.

36:59.260 --> 37:01.480
Ma, are you breaking up
with me?

37:01.523 --> 37:04.222
No. I'm just saying

37:04.265 --> 37:06.354
there are "you and me" things,

37:06.398 --> 37:08.748
and there are
"him and me" things.

37:08.791 --> 37:10.663
And...

37:11.968 --> 37:16.843
Rogelio and I have
come to a decision.

37:18.975 --> 37:20.325
And I've actually decided

37:20.368 --> 37:21.891
to have a single
mastectomy.

37:24.938 --> 37:25.895
Absolutely.

37:25.939 --> 37:27.767
Thanks.

37:27.810 --> 37:30.030
So, it's time to say
good-bye to my boob.

37:30.073 --> 37:33.294
But not without
a proper send-off,

37:33.338 --> 37:35.601
a good-bye party.I love that.

37:35.644 --> 37:37.603
A bon boob-age party.

37:37.646 --> 37:39.605
We can make a boob cake.With...

37:39.648 --> 37:41.128
my husband.

37:42.608 --> 37:44.566
Right.

37:44.610 --> 37:46.873
Of course,
that is a "you guys" thing.

37:46.916 --> 37:48.744
Uh, I'll just say good-bye
to your boob now.

37:48.788 --> 37:49.745
Bye-bye, boobie.

37:49.789 --> 37:51.138
[laughs]

37:51.181 --> 37:53.227
ROGELIO:
Good-bye, Leftie.

37:53.271 --> 37:56.578
Tata and I will miss you.

37:56.622 --> 37:58.058
And though I'm sad
to lose you,

37:58.101 --> 37:59.233
I'm grateful for these years

37:59.277 --> 38:00.539
that you have
adorned the chest

38:00.582 --> 38:04.064
of the most magnificent
woman in the world.

38:04.107 --> 38:08.198
And tonight...
I honor you.

38:08.242 --> 38:09.809
[laughs]

38:09.852 --> 38:12.202
I never knew you had
nicknames for my boobs.

38:12.246 --> 38:13.813
Oh, I have many,
many nicknames

38:13.856 --> 38:15.205
because I have thought
about your breasts

38:15.249 --> 38:17.643
for many, many hours.[chuckles]

38:17.686 --> 38:20.167
And I will miss you,

38:20.210 --> 38:23.213
and I love you.

38:23.257 --> 38:25.955
But I love Xiomara more.

38:31.700 --> 38:33.485
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
What a relief to know that

38:33.528 --> 38:35.661
even when times are hard,

38:35.704 --> 38:38.403
romance is alive and well.

38:38.446 --> 38:40.361
Unless you're Petra.

38:40.405 --> 38:42.624
Are those yoga pants?

38:44.974 --> 38:48.369
Wow, she's really taking
the whole J.R. thing hard.

38:48.413 --> 38:50.632
Okay, that's a new low. [doorbell rings]

38:55.724 --> 38:57.378
What are you doing here?

38:57.422 --> 39:00.033
I was impressed
back at the restaurant.

39:02.078 --> 39:05.995
Now, that is what I call
a romantic gesture.

39:07.345 --> 39:09.738
What about your date?

39:09.782 --> 39:13.829
She wouldn't have driven
into a carwash for me.

39:13.873 --> 39:15.309
Let alone a car.

39:15.353 --> 39:19.618
So, listen,
vulnerable Petra

39:19.661 --> 39:23.578
is way hotter
than ice queen Petra.

39:25.885 --> 39:27.408
I don't need games.

39:27.452 --> 39:31.325
Understood.

39:31.369 --> 39:35.024
I really, really
like you...

39:35.068 --> 39:37.157
a lot.

39:37.200 --> 39:39.202
Yeah.

39:41.509 --> 39:43.468
I got that.

39:53.521 --> 39:55.131
You taste funny.

39:57.482 --> 39:59.962
I might have been eating
pickles in bed.

40:00.006 --> 40:01.834
Um, I'm gonna go
brush my teeth.

40:01.877 --> 40:03.226
Wait.

40:03.270 --> 40:04.706
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Okay, then,

40:04.750 --> 40:06.534
these two make quite a pair,
don't they?

40:06.578 --> 40:08.318
Speaking of which...

40:10.277 --> 40:13.889
It was everything
I wanted it to be.

40:13.933 --> 40:17.980
Now it's just facing the reality
of surgery tomorrow.

40:21.201 --> 40:23.159
Scared.

40:30.166 --> 40:31.864
Really, Ma?

40:34.954 --> 40:37.260
I don't see how Vicks VapoRub
can help us now.

40:37.304 --> 40:39.088
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I know. All that time

40:39.132 --> 40:41.047
it was just Vicks VapoRub.

40:50.056 --> 40:52.275
Fine. Go ahead.

40:54.147 --> 40:56.497
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: But that
didn't make it less magical.

40:56.541 --> 40:57.933
♪

40:57.977 --> 40:59.979
JANE:
Hey.

41:00.022 --> 41:03.330
Can I get in on some of that
Vivaporu action, too?

41:03.373 --> 41:05.680
[laughs]Is this a "we" thing?

41:05.724 --> 41:07.682
Come.

41:14.646 --> 41:17.518
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: It really
does make things feel better.

41:19.041 --> 41:20.652
But, unfortunately,

41:20.695 --> 41:24.612
it can't stop evil
from coming.

41:24.656 --> 41:27.833
You know what, friends?
We've been through a lot.

41:27.876 --> 41:29.791
And since we've been
talking choices,

41:29.835 --> 41:33.186
I choose to save this
and soothe us all instead

41:33.229 --> 41:35.667
with a little Vivaporu.
