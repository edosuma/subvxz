- I hope you like cacio e pepe.

00:13.310 --> 00:15.413
- I love it, and I love
that you can cook.

00:15.482 --> 00:17.758
- I know four recipes,
and they all fall

00:17.827 --> 00:20.103

How are the girls?
- Uh, they're good.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.310
They're, um, with their mom
in her new apartment.

00:26.862 --> 00:29.137
- Yes.

00:29.206 --> 00:30.931
Certainly cheaper to have
a wife abandon you

00:31.000 --> 00:32.655
than one back in town
divorcing you.

00:33.827 --> 00:37.275
But I will spare you
the details.

00:43.103 --> 00:45.137
- So much.

00:45.206 --> 00:46.931
- If you need me,
I am going to be

00:47.000 --> 00:49.068
in the study
finishing a manuscript.

00:49.137 --> 00:51.172
- Uh, Calvin Crigger,

00:51.241 --> 00:52.862
the editor from Penguin,
wrote a book.

00:52.931 --> 00:54.103
- I thought he left
the business.

00:54.172 --> 00:55.482
- He did for rehab.

00:55.551 --> 00:56.724
The book's a literary memoir

00:56.793 --> 00:57.758
about his drug addiction.

00:57.827 --> 00:58.793
Like "Permanent Midnight"

00:58.862 --> 01:00.172
or the "The Night of the Gun,"

01:00.241 --> 01:02.000
only set in the world
of book publishing.

01:02.068 --> 01:03.689
- Huh. Sounds interesting.

01:03.758 --> 01:06.448
All right, I will come get you
when dinner's ready.

01:06.517 --> 01:09.137
The recipe says
20 minutes so, uh,

01:09.206 --> 01:11.551
give me an hour.
No rush.

01:12.310 --> 01:14.172
- I like those.

01:14.241 --> 01:16.068
- They're for reading.

01:17.241 --> 01:20.793
- Wow. They are very,
very sexy.

01:20.862 --> 01:23.000
- Wait till you see the ones
I wear for night driving.

01:26.275 --> 01:27.379
- Make me dinner!

01:29.206 --> 01:30.862
- All right, beauties,
I've held you all

01:30.931 --> 01:33.379
in suspense long enough.
As Kelsey's publicist--

01:33.448 --> 01:35.172
- You're not my publicist.
- Ignore the drunk blonde

01:35.241 --> 01:37.586

- Yes.

01:45.620 --> 01:47.310
Wait, are you kidding me?

01:47.379 --> 01:48.965
- Nope.
Who's your publicist now?

01:49.034 --> 01:50.310
- Oh, my God!

01:50.379 --> 01:51.724
- That's so awesome, Kelsey.

01:51.793 --> 01:53.586
- And each recipient
gets introduced

01:53.655 --> 01:54.965
by another inspiring woman

01:55.034 --> 01:56.310
who's also at the top
of her game,

01:56.379 --> 01:59.379

I mean, she's no Maggie Amato.

how did this happen?

it was an easy sell.

02:13.482 --> 02:15.206

09:49.068 --> 09:50.758
It has to be Millennial.

09:50.827 --> 09:52.586
Empirical is like

10:22.724 --> 10:23.620
Yeah, how could we miss him?

10:26.172 --> 10:27.586

he looked really familiar.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.448

it came to me, pun intended.

10:33.517 --> 10:36.137
He was in the first porn

The hard truth is
that this whole idea

13:59.931 --> 14:02.206

holding women back.

but for me, it's not
about the money.

20:29.931 --> 20:31.896
I just--I really want to
do the book with Millennial.

20:31.965 --> 20:33.724
- That's amazing.

20:34.931 --> 20:38.827
You know, tonight I am getting
the maverick award.

20:38.896 --> 20:42.241
I would be honored
if you would introduce me.

20:42.310 --> 20:44.172
- I think you should be
the maverick you are

20:44.241 --> 20:46.931
and accept the award
on your own.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.620
- Um, but you know,
every other woman

20:48.689 --> 20:50.172
is having someone
introduce them,

20:50.241 --> 20:52.931
but yeah, I could see
how that is also cool.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.068
- I got it.

20:55.137 --> 20:56.689
Thank you.

20:56.758 --> 20:58.068
- Mm-hmm.

20:58.137 --> 20:59.758
- A maverick

20:59.827 --> 21:01.965
is an independent person

21:02.034 --> 21:04.172
who blazes their own path.

21:04.241 --> 21:05.862
There are women who got to

21:05.931 --> 21:07.517
where they are
without needing help,

21:07.586 --> 21:10.137
and I admire them.

21:10.206 --> 21:12.896
But I am not one of them.

21:12.965 --> 21:16.655
I am very lucky to not be
running Millennial on my own.

21:16.724 --> 21:18.517
I have an amazing partner.

21:20.172 --> 21:22.344
Who should be up here with me.

21:22.413 --> 21:24.793
A partnership like ours is rare

21:24.862 --> 21:26.689
and sometimes challenging,

21:26.758 --> 21:28.862
but we never stand
in each other's way,

21:28.931 --> 21:31.689
personally or professionally,

21:31.758 --> 21:34.793
because we know
that we are better together.

21:36.241 --> 21:39.310
So thank you "Glamour"
for this award

21:39.379 --> 21:41.379
on behalf of myself

21:41.448 --> 21:43.620
and Liza Miller.

21:55.758 --> 21:57.206
- I was starting a business.

21:57.275 --> 21:58.896
I needed money,
and it was so long ago.

21:58.965 --> 22:01.068
No one ever even saw it,
then the internet

22:01.137 --> 22:03.310
got invented and...

22:03.379 --> 22:05.172
Haven't you ever done
anything stupid?

22:06.241 --> 22:07.965
- I married a gay man.

22:09.241 --> 22:11.172
- Diana, I hate
that you saw that.

22:11.241 --> 22:13.172
But I'm not in my 20s.
I'm in my 40s.

22:13.241 --> 22:15.965
I come with baggage
like everyone else.

22:18.379 --> 22:19.896
- I know how you come.

22:20.862 --> 22:22.793
And it's not like anyone else.

22:45.827 --> 22:47.482
- We are.

22:47.551 --> 22:50.000
But you should know,
Kelsey is a priority of mine.

22:50.068 --> 22:51.793
- I get it.

22:51.862 --> 22:54.896
I just don't want to wait
any longer to be with you.

22:56.275 --> 22:57.620
- I feel the same way.

22:58.896 --> 23:01.896
- But there's just a lot
on the table right now

23:01.965 --> 23:04.275
with my divorce,

23:04.344 --> 23:06.689
with Empirical, so for now,

23:06.758 --> 23:11.586
it's important that no one else
knows about us.

23:11.655 --> 23:14.275
- I understand.

23:14.344 --> 23:17.896
But keeping this relationship a
secret, it's not gonna be easy.

23:17.965 --> 23:21.482
