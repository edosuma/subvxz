37:00.416 --> 37:04.580
There's one more thing I need to know
before we can all call it a day.

37:04.654 --> 37:08.215
- Where's the granilith?
- I'm not telling you.

37:08.291 --> 37:10.385
Oh,you will.

[Loud Groaning]

37:13.796 --> 37:17.198
Wait. I'll take you there.just you and me.
This has nothing to do with them.

37:17.266 --> 37:21.294
- Max, don't.
- This is too easy.

37:31.714 --> 37:34.240
Either way,
you're going to die, Max...

37:34.317 --> 37:37.912
so why don't you just
make this easy on yourself?

37:37.987 --> 37:41.753
[Groaning]

37:43.960 --> 37:46.759
Keep it together, DeLuca.

37:50.600 --> 37:53.467
Ready to tell me now?

38:51.794 --> 38:55.526
What hap-
What just happened?

38:55.598 --> 38:57.726
You saved us.

39:03.206 --> 39:05.140
Vilandra?

39:29.832 --> 39:32.597
- Alex.
- Morning, Sheriff.

39:32.668 --> 39:35.899
- Skip the pancakes.
- Yeah?

39:35.972 --> 39:41.274
Hey, kiddo.
How's it goin'?

39:42.945 --> 39:46.279
Good. You?

39:46.349 --> 39:50.718
- Good.
- Great.

39:53.823 --> 39:57.259
- Mom! - How hard can it be
to sit down to one breakfast?

39:57.326 --> 39:59.624
But, no, everybody
has to go running.

39:59.695 --> 40:02.756
Isabel, why <:an't we just
be like a normal family?

40:02.832 --> 40:07.463
- Oh! - Sweetie, I'm dripping
water all over the floor here.

40:07.537 --> 40:09.733
I'll get it later.

40:27.023 --> 40:29.924
I just wanted to scare them
with a mind warp.

40:29.992 --> 40:32.393
I thought if they saw fire--

40:32.461 --> 40:34.623
It was awful, Max.

40:34.697 --> 40:37.394
I lost control.

40:37.466 --> 40:41.232
I tapped into something
completely different.

40:42.672 --> 40:45.141
Thinkyou could do it again?

40:45.207 --> 40:47.175
I don't want to.
