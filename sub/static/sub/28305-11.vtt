00:01.914 --> 00:03.351
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Friends, we last left
Jane and Rafael

00:03.394 --> 00:05.440
dealing with
an unexpected development.

00:05.483 --> 00:07.311
I believe Mateo does have ADHD.

00:07.355 --> 00:08.443
How can we help him?

00:08.486 --> 00:10.140
Well, there are
treatment options

00:10.184 --> 00:11.968
that range from behavior
interventions to medication.

00:12.012 --> 00:14.362
But at least the two of them
were back in a good place.

00:14.405 --> 00:17.234
Not in such a good place?
Our Petra.

00:17.278 --> 00:19.454
See, she was going
to propose to J.R.,

00:19.497 --> 00:22.326
but then J.R. broke up with her and moved to Houston.

00:22.370 --> 00:24.502
But at least Petra had
a shoulder to ugly-cry on.

00:24.546 --> 00:26.939
I was gonna propose.

00:26.983 --> 00:28.550
Also feeling vulnerable?
Xiomara.

00:28.593 --> 00:31.770
See, she was waiting to find out if her chemotherapy worked.

00:31.814 --> 00:34.686
I'm not out of the woods yet,
until after the PET scan.

00:34.730 --> 00:36.993
And so, yeah, everything was
on pause for now,

00:37.037 --> 00:39.300
including her sex life,
unlike Alba,

00:39.343 --> 00:40.475
who just got hitched!

00:40.518 --> 00:42.390
That's right.

00:42.433 --> 00:45.001
Alba and Jorge went
from first base to a home run.

00:45.045 --> 00:47.395
And speaking of home runs,

00:47.438 --> 00:49.353
Rogelio had
a brand-new TV show.

00:49.397 --> 00:52.095
What if our young lead's story
is in present day

00:52.139 --> 00:54.358
and you and River
are living in the future?

00:54.402 --> 00:55.751
On Mars!

00:55.794 --> 00:59.320
We can call it This Is Mars.

00:59.363 --> 01:01.452
I know,
pretty out there, right?

01:01.496 --> 01:03.454
But hey, it's a telenovela.

01:03.498 --> 01:07.458
So let's blast off into ours.

01:07.502 --> 01:10.461
When Jane Gloriana Villanueva
was...

01:10.505 --> 01:12.681
well, actually,
for all of Jane's life,

01:12.724 --> 01:15.727
there was no man of the house,
just three women.

01:15.771 --> 01:17.512
And they didn't need a man,

01:17.555 --> 01:19.470
because they took care
of it all.

01:19.514 --> 01:20.906
Electricity went up.

01:20.950 --> 01:22.343
Mom, remember not to leave

01:22.386 --> 01:23.779
your curling iron
plugged in all day.

01:23.822 --> 01:26.086
My curling iron doesn't use
half as much electricity

01:26.129 --> 01:28.784
as the fans your abuela
keeps running all day.

01:32.657 --> 01:34.137
XIOMARA: There,
no more wobble.

01:34.181 --> 01:36.139
JANE:
Ooh, I like that nail polish.

01:36.183 --> 01:38.054
Thanks. it's called
Breakfast in Red.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.577
I'll loan it to you.

01:41.362 --> 01:43.494
In fact, Jane had never heard

01:43.538 --> 01:47.542
the term "man of the house"
used in real life until...

01:52.112 --> 01:54.157
JORGE:
Mm.

01:57.421 --> 02:00.946
Aww, looks like the man
and woman of the house

02:00.990 --> 02:03.166
are in still
in the honeymoon phase.

02:03.210 --> 02:04.950
So what's on the
agenda today? Huh?

02:04.994 --> 02:07.388
Besides being totally adorable.

02:11.827 --> 02:13.002
JORGE:
Now that our arrangement

02:13.045 --> 02:14.482
is permanent,

02:14.525 --> 02:16.484
I'm taking my things
out of storage.

02:16.527 --> 02:19.051
Oh, great.

02:21.663 --> 02:22.838
Not at all. I'll
do it right now.

02:22.881 --> 02:24.579
Anything for my new step-abuelo.

02:24.622 --> 02:26.058
And maybe you could move some

02:26.102 --> 02:28.583
of your bathroom things
into your room.

02:28.626 --> 02:30.759
All the hair stuff.

02:30.802 --> 02:33.240
Of course.

02:49.560 --> 02:50.387
Hey, uh,

02:50.431 --> 02:52.433
how you feeling?Itchy.

02:52.476 --> 02:54.478
Your sheets are awful.
What thread count are they?

02:54.522 --> 02:56.219
I don't know. They were on sale.

02:56.263 --> 02:57.916
I'll have Temp send you
a set from the hotel.

02:57.960 --> 02:59.091
They're Egyptian cotton.

02:59.135 --> 03:01.224
I...

03:01.268 --> 03:03.618
I meant how
are you feeling about J.R.?

03:03.661 --> 03:05.228
I had a good cry and now
I'm going to move forward.

03:05.272 --> 03:08.188
It's okay to give yourself
some time to wallow.

03:08.231 --> 03:10.015
No, I wallowed last night,
now I'm moving on.

03:10.059 --> 03:11.669
Fresh start.

03:11.713 --> 03:14.106
Ugh. I'm supposed to be
in a meeting right now,

03:14.150 --> 03:15.717
but Temp didn't remind me.

03:15.760 --> 03:17.632
You know what?

03:17.675 --> 03:19.721
Today I'm about fresh starts
all around. She's fired.

03:19.764 --> 03:22.332
Oh, no. Uh... Poor Temp.

03:22.376 --> 03:24.204
When you reward incompetence,
we all lose.

03:24.247 --> 03:26.684
Wait. Uh, I'll walk you out.

03:26.728 --> 03:28.991
I have to get to Rafael's
to talk about...

03:29.034 --> 03:30.645
Mateo! Five more minutes, okay?

03:32.560 --> 03:35.476
So what do you think about
putting him on ADHD medication?

03:35.519 --> 03:38.218
I really don't want
to go to that right away.

03:38.261 --> 03:40.350
Because medication
is a lifelong decision,

03:40.394 --> 03:42.309
and he is so young and I just,

03:42.352 --> 03:44.006
I don't feel comfortable...Jane.

03:44.049 --> 03:46.574
I agree.
You do?

03:46.617 --> 03:49.620
Yeah, 100%. I'm obviously not
anti-medication--

03:49.664 --> 03:52.144
it's really helped a lot with my
depression-- but I'm an adult,

03:52.188 --> 03:54.625
and he's a kid, so we should try
other options first.

03:54.669 --> 03:56.192
Exactly. So let's dive

03:56.236 --> 03:57.976
into behavior modification.Sounds good.

03:58.020 --> 04:01.632
Now hand over whatever ten-step
list I know you've already made.

04:01.676 --> 04:03.678
Actually, it's 15,
with subcategories.

04:03.721 --> 04:04.940
I've been researching and...

04:04.983 --> 04:06.463
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
You know,

04:06.507 --> 04:08.073
I'm the man of this telenovela,

04:08.117 --> 04:10.467
and I say
let's skip the boring stuff.

04:10.511 --> 04:13.688
It all boils down
to three basic headlines...

04:14.993 --> 04:16.691
In other words, "cut the crap."

04:18.736 --> 04:22.523
Uh, sorry, I'm just picturing
Jane working out. Whew.

04:22.566 --> 04:23.567
Okay.

04:26.353 --> 04:28.703
And the most important thing
to remember is

04:28.746 --> 04:30.879
it's not about the days,
it's about the patterns.

04:30.922 --> 04:32.837
That's our mantra.

04:32.881 --> 04:35.144
Look at us, with a mantra.A mantra. And...

04:35.187 --> 04:37.102
a notebook.
Ah.

04:37.146 --> 04:39.104
So we can keep a log
of Mateo's activities.

04:39.148 --> 04:41.324
We need everything to be
as consistent as possible

04:41.368 --> 04:42.891
between our two places

04:42.934 --> 04:44.893
so we can track
Mateo's patterns over time.

04:44.936 --> 04:46.677
Per the mantra.

04:46.721 --> 04:48.200
Remind me of the mantra again?

04:48.244 --> 04:49.332
I'll write it in the notebook.

04:49.376 --> 04:50.507
ROGELIO:
You've got this.

04:50.551 --> 04:52.379
You're killing it, Dina.

04:52.422 --> 04:54.381
Okay, bye.

04:54.424 --> 04:57.209
Dina's been working like a
madwoman to finish the script

04:57.253 --> 04:59.211
for This Is Mars.
She's almost done.

04:59.255 --> 05:01.866
Wow, that was fast.

05:01.910 --> 05:05.566
Yeah. She's turning it in
tonight, yes, she is.

05:05.609 --> 05:10.005
The pilot is brilliant.
Between that and this,

05:10.048 --> 05:12.181
the network has to
give us a pilot order.

05:12.224 --> 05:14.183
That's great, hon.

05:14.226 --> 05:16.968
Hopefully, we'll both
be getting good news soon.

05:17.012 --> 05:19.580
The doctor scheduled
my final PET scan.

05:19.623 --> 05:22.626
In three weeks, we'll find out
if the chemo worked.

05:22.670 --> 05:24.628
Really?

05:24.672 --> 05:26.804
How are you feeling?

05:26.848 --> 05:31.287
I'm nervous,
but I'm trying to stay positive.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.811
I keep picturing all
of the things I'll be able to do

05:33.855 --> 05:35.683
once I know the cancer's gone.

05:35.726 --> 05:40.340
Get back to work,
dance again.

05:40.383 --> 05:43.778
And maybe even get our sex life
back on track before we turn 50.

05:45.083 --> 05:47.042
Well, no matter
what happens,

05:47.085 --> 05:50.088
we're in this together,
and that's the key.

05:51.133 --> 05:52.830
Ah! Abuela!

05:52.874 --> 05:54.005
Hmm?

05:54.049 --> 05:55.877
What happened to the table
by the door?

06:00.882 --> 06:01.970
Don't. I-I want it.

06:19.770 --> 06:21.293
JORGE:
Jane, door!

06:25.863 --> 06:27.256
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yeah, so there's been

06:27.299 --> 06:29.867
quite a bit of re-Jorganizing
in here.

06:33.654 --> 06:36.178
I've got it, don't worry.

06:37.484 --> 06:39.747
Petra? What's wrong?

06:39.790 --> 06:42.750
Oh, I was cleaning the penthouse

06:42.793 --> 06:46.275
because my idiot temp messed up
the maid schedule again.

06:46.318 --> 06:47.842
Maybe it's time
to cut her loose.

06:47.885 --> 06:49.278
Him.

06:49.321 --> 06:50.801
Oh, sorry,
it's been three weeks.

06:50.845 --> 06:52.586
Let me catch you up.

06:52.629 --> 06:54.979
As you'll recall,
Petra had this temp.

06:55.023 --> 06:59.157
But then she had this one,
then this one and this one.

06:59.201 --> 07:00.637
And...

07:00.681 --> 07:02.073
But that's not the point.

07:02.117 --> 07:04.162
The point is
when I was cleaning,

07:04.206 --> 07:06.817
I found the engagement ring
I was going to give J.R.

07:06.861 --> 07:09.472
and I know I shouldn't have
looked at it, but I did,

07:09.516 --> 07:12.910
and now...
Aww.

07:15.522 --> 07:17.175
How long is this going to last?

07:17.219 --> 07:19.700
I'm so sick of crying.

07:19.743 --> 07:21.702
I feel like a Villanueva.

07:21.745 --> 07:24.792
I know, I know, but,

07:24.835 --> 07:27.098
uh, it's like I told you
on the phone last night...

07:27.142 --> 07:28.883
And the past 20 nights.

07:28.926 --> 07:30.667
...grieving is a process.

07:30.711 --> 07:33.104
Maybe it's time to take
the next step in the process.

07:33.148 --> 07:34.192
Showering?

07:34.236 --> 07:35.977
Returning the engagement ring.

07:36.020 --> 07:38.501
Will you come with me?Of course.
But tomorrow,

07:38.545 --> 07:40.024
'cause we're about
to have dinner.

07:41.112 --> 07:43.201
Did Alba make arepas?

07:43.245 --> 07:45.595
Yeah. Do you want to...Oh...

07:45.639 --> 07:47.945
Yeah, thanks.

07:53.951 --> 07:56.214
Geez, who died?

07:56.258 --> 07:59.087
Uh, actually, my mom's getting
her final PET scan tomorrow,

07:59.130 --> 08:01.611
to see if her cancer
treatment worked.

08:01.655 --> 08:02.873
PETRA:
Oh, my God,
I'm so sorry.

08:02.917 --> 08:04.788
I'll go.It's okay.

08:04.832 --> 08:07.095
Please stay.
ALBA: You're
just in time

08:07.138 --> 08:08.531
to pray with us.

08:08.575 --> 08:10.054
I will do it in English.

08:13.710 --> 08:17.018
We ask you, Heavenly Father,

08:17.061 --> 08:20.935
to guide Xiomara,
as you already have,

08:20.978 --> 08:24.242
through her journey with cancer.

08:24.286 --> 08:28.638
We pray that the treatments
have done their work,

08:28.682 --> 08:31.598
that her suffering is at an end.

08:31.641 --> 08:37.125
We pray that her life
from now on be blessed

08:37.168 --> 08:41.564
and full of joy and good health.

08:41.608 --> 08:45.786
In the name of the Father
and the Son

08:45.829 --> 08:49.093
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.Amen.

08:49.137 --> 08:51.313
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Amen.

08:58.233 --> 09:00.452
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
You'll recall,
we last left Jane

09:00.496 --> 09:01.976
praying for her mother.

09:02.019 --> 09:03.455
Her PET scan's later today.

09:03.499 --> 09:05.327
Waiting is the hardest part.

09:05.370 --> 09:09.853
Do you want to distract yourself
with some reading material?

09:09.897 --> 09:12.116
It is a real page-turner.Ooh.

09:12.160 --> 09:14.205
I especially love the part
about the color

09:14.249 --> 09:17.295
of the sunrise when you ran
Mateo to school last week.

09:17.339 --> 09:20.081
Okay, maybe my entries
are a little too detailed,

09:20.124 --> 09:21.691
but at least
you can read

09:21.735 --> 09:23.214
my handwriting. I...

09:23.258 --> 09:25.739
I am sorry,
but what is a "meldooper"?

09:25.782 --> 09:27.131
Meltdown.

09:27.175 --> 09:29.481
Oh. Oh, no, what happened?

09:29.525 --> 09:32.659
He lost it
at Ethan's birthday party.

09:32.702 --> 09:34.574
It was hard to sell him
on a nitrate-free Fruit Roll-Up

09:34.617 --> 09:36.140
when all the other kids
got cake.

09:36.184 --> 09:37.620
How bad?

09:37.664 --> 09:39.753
"We owe Ethan's mom
a new lamp" bad.

09:39.796 --> 09:41.319
It's not about the days...

09:41.363 --> 09:43.539
It's about the pattern. I know.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.323
It's just a small setback.

09:45.367 --> 09:47.151
Should we talk about it
over dinner?

09:47.195 --> 09:49.153
Oh, I, uh, can't tonight.

09:49.197 --> 09:51.112
What, you got a hot date?

09:51.155 --> 09:53.505
I mean, not a hotdate.

09:53.549 --> 09:55.943
Just a regular one?

09:55.986 --> 09:59.207
Careful.
Don't have a meldooper, Jane.

09:59.250 --> 10:02.558
Oh. Okay. Hope it goes well.

10:05.430 --> 10:07.955
Slow down, Mateo, you know
we don't run in the house.

10:07.998 --> 10:09.739
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
It's important to note

10:09.783 --> 10:12.742
that Jane wanted to talk
to herabuela about Rafael,

10:12.786 --> 10:15.658
but unfortunately,
she had bigger fish to fry.

10:17.399 --> 10:18.748
Do you?

10:18.792 --> 10:20.010
Hmm...

10:23.710 --> 10:24.928
Mm-hmm.

10:42.424 --> 10:45.645
If he can catch a giant fish,
I think he can probably

10:45.688 --> 10:47.647
make his own tuna sandwich.

10:52.260 --> 10:54.871
I know.
I'm-- I just mean,

10:54.915 --> 10:56.351
you're a strong,
independent

10:56.394 --> 10:59.789
woman. You don't have
to let him hang something

10:59.833 --> 11:01.269
on the wall
if you don't like it.

11:06.578 --> 11:08.493
And yours.

11:14.195 --> 11:16.414
Yeah, Jane. Ours.

11:16.458 --> 11:18.416
JANE:
It's like they're living
in the '50s.

11:18.460 --> 11:21.419
He might as well have said,
"Woman, go make me a sandwich!"

11:21.463 --> 11:23.334
Woman, go
easy on him.
Ah...

11:23.378 --> 11:26.120
I'm just worried this
will become a pattern.

11:26.163 --> 11:28.122
He's herhusband, not yours.

11:28.165 --> 11:30.167
And I know you don't excel
at minding your own business,

11:30.211 --> 11:33.605
but you should stay
out of their marriage.

11:33.649 --> 11:35.912
You've got this.

11:35.956 --> 11:37.522
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

11:39.394 --> 11:41.396
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And speaking of marriage...

11:41.439 --> 11:42.832
How did the
proposal go?

11:42.876 --> 11:44.834
Would I be standing here
with a ring if it went well?

11:45.922 --> 11:47.184
That was a rhetorical question.

11:47.228 --> 11:48.403
She just wants her money back.

11:48.446 --> 11:49.317
Right away.

11:51.972 --> 11:55.540
Wow.
Just handing over that ring

11:55.584 --> 11:57.586
makes me feel like
a weight has been lifted.

11:57.629 --> 11:59.501
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Well, it was
a three-carat diamond.

11:59.544 --> 12:01.111
You were right.

12:01.155 --> 12:03.418
Ooh, it feels good to get rid
of that reminder of J.R.

12:03.461 --> 12:06.769
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
That's one small step
for Petra...

12:06.813 --> 12:10.207
and one giant leap
for Rogelio de la Vega.

12:10.251 --> 12:12.427
That's right.
Dina really was on a roll.

12:12.470 --> 12:15.517
AndThis is Mars got a pilot
order from the network!

12:15.560 --> 12:17.432
How does that space suit feel?

12:17.475 --> 12:19.303
Sleek, supple
and slimming.

12:19.347 --> 12:22.524
I can't wait to get in front
of the cameras tomorrow.

12:22.567 --> 12:25.788
Rogelio, thank you for the
beautiful Martian bouquet.

12:25.832 --> 12:26.789
Of course.

12:33.361 --> 12:36.059
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Uh-oh. That's gonna
be a problem.

12:36.103 --> 12:37.669
They're not
gonna be a problem.

12:37.713 --> 12:39.497
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, ignore me!

12:39.541 --> 12:41.325
We're so much more
talented than them.

12:41.369 --> 12:42.500
And you're so sexy.

12:42.544 --> 12:44.067
And you're
so gorgeous.

12:44.111 --> 12:46.243
And our skin glows
like the sun.

12:46.287 --> 12:49.725
BOTH:
And theirs will only get worse.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.553
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Looks like they have
a mantra, too.

12:53.511 --> 12:56.950
And so will your skin if
you keep frowning like that.

12:56.993 --> 12:58.560
Do you know
how much botox

12:58.603 --> 13:01.084
it takes to get rid
of worry wrinkles?

13:01.128 --> 13:04.000
Approximately eight
to 20 units.
Exactly.

13:04.044 --> 13:07.134
Forget them.

13:07.177 --> 13:08.962
No, I was just thinking
about Xiomara.

13:09.005 --> 13:12.792
She had her PET scan this
morning, so now we're waiting.

13:23.237 --> 13:26.936
It's just a telemarketer.

13:26.980 --> 13:29.809
Look, I appreciate the support,

13:29.852 --> 13:31.375
but you guys
should really go home.

13:31.419 --> 13:33.464
The doctor probably
won't even call today.

13:42.996 --> 13:44.649
Yeah.

13:44.693 --> 13:47.435
I thought I was headed in the
right direction, you know?

13:47.478 --> 13:49.176
Getting used to
us as friends.

13:49.219 --> 13:51.308
But this feels like
a real setback.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.186
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yeah, remember, Jane,
you're gorgeous,

13:59.229 --> 14:00.796
your skin looks amazing, and--

14:00.840 --> 14:03.581
oh, sorry. Wrong mantra.

14:03.625 --> 14:05.148
"It's not about the days,

14:05.192 --> 14:08.586
it's about the pattern."

14:11.328 --> 14:12.590
It's the doctor's office.

14:12.634 --> 14:14.549
We're right here
with you, Mom.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.987
Mm-hmm.Thank you.

14:18.031 --> 14:19.467
But can I have
one of my hands back

14:19.510 --> 14:21.338
so I can answer?Oh!

14:26.039 --> 14:28.215
Hello?

14:28.258 --> 14:29.825
Yes, this is Xiomara.

14:31.566 --> 14:33.655
Okay.

14:35.787 --> 14:37.746
Okay.

14:37.789 --> 14:41.054
Thank you. Bye.

14:43.752 --> 14:46.233
I'm cancer-free.

14:46.276 --> 14:48.626
Oh, yes!

14:50.193 --> 14:53.588
Oh, I have to call your father.

14:53.631 --> 14:56.156
Oh, thank God.
I'm so happy.

14:56.199 --> 14:58.332
I can't wait to see you
tonight and celebrate.

14:58.375 --> 15:00.595
Okay. You too.

15:02.597 --> 15:06.122
Xo's PET scan results came
back, and she is cancer-free!

15:06.166 --> 15:08.211
Finally...

15:08.255 --> 15:10.561
we can be together!

15:10.605 --> 15:12.868
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Mars, we have a problem.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.659
Ms. Fields? They'd
like to see you

15:21.703 --> 15:24.140
for one more zero-
gravity hair test.

15:43.768 --> 15:45.814
To not having cancer.

15:45.857 --> 15:48.686
To not
having cancer.

15:52.038 --> 15:54.518
I've been saying it
over and over all day,

15:54.562 --> 15:56.129
but it's hard to
believe it, you know?

15:56.172 --> 15:58.305
It's hard to just
click back to normal.

15:58.348 --> 16:01.134
Give yourself time.
It'll happen.

16:01.177 --> 16:03.527
Agreed.

16:03.571 --> 16:05.573
And maybe this will help.

16:10.708 --> 16:14.103
Should we dance,
Mr. de la Vega?

16:14.147 --> 16:17.541
I would love
to dance, Mrs. de la Vega.

16:21.502 --> 16:25.680
I'm so happy.Me, too.

16:25.723 --> 16:27.160
So happy.

16:27.203 --> 16:31.816
I also have a piece of-of
teeny, tiny,

16:31.860 --> 16:35.603
totally unimportant,
not-so-happy news.

16:35.646 --> 16:38.606
News that won't even
matter in light

16:38.649 --> 16:40.564
of how great your
news is.

16:40.608 --> 16:42.044
What are you
talking about?

16:42.088 --> 16:43.872
River kissed me.

16:43.915 --> 16:46.657
What?

16:48.268 --> 16:49.878
Obviously,
it wasn't reciprocated.

16:49.921 --> 16:51.967
Because I'm happily,
ecstatically

16:52.011 --> 16:54.883
married to the most
amazing woman on the planet.

16:54.926 --> 16:57.625
So I'm sure that
after your clear PET scan,

16:57.668 --> 16:59.192
this little incident

16:59.235 --> 17:02.586
will roll right off your back.

17:02.630 --> 17:05.241
Oh, hell no!

17:05.285 --> 17:08.679
I cannot believe that conniving
bitch made a pass at you!

17:08.723 --> 17:09.941
What was she thinking?

17:09.985 --> 17:11.160
Apparently she thought that our

17:11.204 --> 17:13.728
love-hate relationship
was mostly love.

17:13.771 --> 17:15.164
Have you been
flirting with her?

17:15.208 --> 17:17.558
No! Of course not!

17:17.601 --> 17:19.951
I've only been
nice to her.
How nice?

17:19.995 --> 17:22.476
People fall in love with me
all the time, Xiomara.

17:22.519 --> 17:23.738
I usually see it coming.

17:23.781 --> 17:27.133
But don't worry.
I will clear it all up.

17:27.176 --> 17:29.352
I just have to
handle this delicately.

17:29.396 --> 17:30.397
Because I don't want
to jeopardize

17:30.440 --> 17:31.659
our working relationship.

17:31.702 --> 17:34.749
You better set
her straight.

17:34.792 --> 17:36.011
I promise. I will.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.100
Still want to dance?

17:38.144 --> 17:39.667
JORGE:
Are you kidding?

17:39.710 --> 17:41.538
Another amazing meal.

17:41.582 --> 17:43.671
Even when your abuela's
at work! I don't know

17:43.714 --> 17:46.108
how she does it.
She cooks, she cleans...

17:46.152 --> 17:48.284
She is the
perfect woman.

17:48.328 --> 17:49.981
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Hmm. I'm not sure
their criteria

17:50.025 --> 17:51.548
for that is the same...

17:54.595 --> 17:56.336
Ooh.

17:58.860 --> 18:01.776
Oh-- Oh, uh, Mateo?

18:01.819 --> 18:04.039
Take your plate to the sink.
Remember, we have

18:04.083 --> 18:05.388
a dinner routine:
set the table,

18:05.432 --> 18:06.824
eat, clear the table.

18:06.868 --> 18:08.609
Jorge didn't have
to clear hisplate.

18:08.652 --> 18:11.133
Why should Ihave to?
I'm the man of the house, too.

18:11.177 --> 18:12.700
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oof. This is not the pattern

18:12.743 --> 18:14.789
Jane was trying to reinforce.

18:14.832 --> 18:16.617
You might be a man,

18:16.660 --> 18:19.663
but gender roles have evolved,
and boys and girls

18:19.707 --> 18:21.012
do the same
things now.

18:21.056 --> 18:23.232
And frankly,
"man of the house"

18:23.276 --> 18:25.626
is not a term
people even use anymore.

18:25.669 --> 18:28.324
I don't care,
I just want to watch soccer.

18:28.368 --> 18:29.630
Oh, uh...

18:29.673 --> 18:31.414
sorry, Mateo.
No screen time on weeknights.

18:31.458 --> 18:33.982
Grab your dish and we'll
go pick out a book.No!

18:36.463 --> 18:37.899
This is not up for discussion.
Reading time.

18:37.942 --> 18:39.118
I don't want to read!
I hate reading!
Now.

18:39.161 --> 18:42.077
Mateo...No! No-no-no-no-no...

18:45.907 --> 18:47.300
Do you have
a minute?

18:47.343 --> 18:49.563
Oh. You want
to join me?

18:49.606 --> 18:51.826
Um, no.
But thank you.

18:51.869 --> 18:53.132
Is my grandma here?

18:53.175 --> 18:54.698
Grocery shopping.

18:54.742 --> 18:56.657
That woman never
gets tired.

18:56.700 --> 18:58.702
Glad Mateo's
calmed down.

18:58.746 --> 19:00.661
Last night was a doozy.

19:00.704 --> 19:04.795
Actually, um, maybe we can talk
for a minute about that.

19:04.839 --> 19:08.886
So, I know living together
has been an adjustment.

19:08.930 --> 19:11.019
For everyone.
But since we are

19:11.062 --> 19:13.761
living under the same roof,
there are a few things

19:13.804 --> 19:15.806
that you could do that would
really help me out

19:15.850 --> 19:18.940
with Mateo.Oh, okay. Sure.

19:18.983 --> 19:20.376
Well, for example,
the television.

19:20.420 --> 19:22.422
Uh, with Mateo's ADHD,

19:22.465 --> 19:25.468
we're really trying to establish
patterns and healthy routines,

19:25.512 --> 19:28.950
and it is hard for Mateo
to focus when the TV is on.

19:28.993 --> 19:30.778
So, if you could
maybe wait

19:30.821 --> 19:33.041
until Mateo's asleep
to watch TV?

19:33.084 --> 19:34.912
Uh, just on the nights

19:34.956 --> 19:36.566
when he's sleeping over,
of course.

19:36.610 --> 19:37.741
Okay.

19:37.785 --> 19:40.962
And also,
it would be really great

19:41.005 --> 19:42.224
if, when Mateo's around,

19:42.268 --> 19:44.183
you could pick up your dishes?

19:44.226 --> 19:45.880
Just to
help us reinforce

19:45.923 --> 19:47.186
good behavioral routines.

19:47.229 --> 19:48.839
Ah. Gotcha.

19:48.883 --> 19:50.406
And obviously,
if there's anything

19:50.450 --> 19:51.886
I can help you with,
I'm all ears.

19:51.929 --> 19:53.670
Sounds good.

19:53.714 --> 19:55.803
Thank you, Jorge!

19:55.846 --> 19:56.847
I really
appreciate that.

19:56.891 --> 19:59.110
Uh... now I have to run.

19:59.154 --> 20:00.373
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Literally.

20:00.416 --> 20:03.419
In case you forgot...

20:03.463 --> 20:04.812
You're doing great,
Mr. Sweetface!

20:04.855 --> 20:07.815
More like Mr. Sweaty-face!

20:07.858 --> 20:11.253
Ah! Come on, Mateo.

20:11.297 --> 20:13.212
Only five more blocks. Huh?

20:13.255 --> 20:15.518
And you'll be able to focus
so much better at school

20:15.562 --> 20:16.780
if you get some of
the energy out now.

20:16.824 --> 20:19.827
I'm not going!
I'm tired.

20:19.870 --> 20:21.524
You've got this!

20:21.568 --> 20:24.614
I hate running,
and you're the worst mommy ever!

20:24.658 --> 20:25.789
You're gonna be late
for school, Mateo.

20:25.833 --> 20:27.051
So? I hate school, too!

20:27.095 --> 20:28.923
I'm staying right here!

20:28.966 --> 20:32.274
Would you move
for a candy bar?

20:32.318 --> 20:35.016
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Technically, a gluten-free,
preservative-free protein bar.

20:35.059 --> 20:37.975
You can have the whole thing
if you finish our run.

20:40.456 --> 20:41.457
What do you say, Mateo?

20:43.111 --> 20:45.287
Huh? Huh? Okay!

21:02.130 --> 21:03.914
What? Nothing.

21:06.221 --> 21:08.876
I just asked him
to put his dishes away,

21:08.919 --> 21:10.878
I can't believe
he tattled on me.

21:13.794 --> 21:15.926
I'm disrespectful?

21:16.971 --> 21:18.973
I think the way he treats you
is disrespectful.

21:19.016 --> 21:20.888
He's making you wait on him
hand and foot.

21:20.931 --> 21:22.019
You're married, not indentured.

21:26.023 --> 21:28.069
Abuela, don't you think
that's a little old-fashioned?

21:30.071 --> 21:32.160
I'm just worried that you're
losing who you are, Abuela.

21:32.203 --> 21:34.467
Establishing bad patterns
for your relationship.

22:01.058 --> 22:02.408
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Damn.

22:02.451 --> 22:03.974
Jane got owned.

22:11.373 --> 22:12.853
Yes, of course.

22:21.035 --> 22:23.429
I would also like an apology.

22:29.913 --> 22:32.568
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And so Jane apologized
to Jorge.

22:32.612 --> 22:34.135
Even though what she wanted
to do was hit him

22:34.178 --> 22:35.571
upside his head
with his big, dumb fish.

22:35.615 --> 22:37.486
And I know I overstepped...

22:37.530 --> 22:39.445
and offended you.

22:39.488 --> 22:41.838
I didn't mean any disrespect
and I'm so sorry.

22:41.882 --> 22:43.536
Thank you, Jane.

22:43.579 --> 22:47.322
And since we're
talking about respect,

22:47.366 --> 22:49.498
there are a few other things
we should discuss.

22:50.543 --> 22:52.414
I-I notice you often park

22:52.458 --> 22:54.851
by the footpath
in front of the house.

22:54.895 --> 22:57.419
I would appreciate it if you
leave that space for Alba,

22:57.463 --> 22:59.160
so she doesn't
have to walk as far

22:59.203 --> 23:00.640
when she gets
home from work.

23:00.683 --> 23:02.424
Got it, will do.Also...

23:02.468 --> 23:04.165
Hmm?...it would be great

23:04.208 --> 23:07.168
if you could be a little quicker
in the bathroom in the mornings.

23:07.211 --> 23:09.344
Quicker in the bathroom, check.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.694
And, also...

23:11.738 --> 23:13.435
when you come home
later than 9:00,

23:13.479 --> 23:15.959
please try to keep it down.

23:16.003 --> 23:18.353
We're both light sleepers.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.964
No problem.

23:21.008 --> 23:22.531
Is that it?

23:22.575 --> 23:23.532
That's it.

23:23.576 --> 23:25.969
Great. See you at home.

23:27.014 --> 23:28.450
PETRA:
I hate this.

23:28.494 --> 23:30.800
I hate everything
about this.

23:30.844 --> 23:33.237
Start over.Hey, what's going on?

23:33.281 --> 23:35.631
I'm redecorating the hotel and
looking at some terrible ideas.

23:35.675 --> 23:37.590
But didn't you just redo it?

23:37.633 --> 23:40.462
That was two years ago, Jane.
That's like a lifetime

23:40.506 --> 23:41.550
in hotel years.
Look,

23:41.594 --> 23:42.812
I know what I'm doing, okay?

23:42.856 --> 23:44.640
Okay, yeah. Great.

23:49.819 --> 23:51.778
MAN:
Yo, Mrs. S.

23:51.821 --> 23:53.562
Here are those blueprints
you asked for.

23:53.606 --> 23:55.434
The task was to get them
signed by Milos.

23:55.477 --> 23:57.958
Are these signed?Nah, brah;
couldn't make it

23:58.001 --> 24:00.090
to the prison in time.
Traffic was gnarly.

24:00.134 --> 24:02.092
I told you Tuesdays were
the only day Milos could get

24:02.136 --> 24:04.181
visitors, now I have to wait
a week to get his signature.

24:04.225 --> 24:05.879
You have to start planning
ahead and if you can't

24:05.922 --> 24:08.272
do that, maybe this
isn't the job for you.

24:08.316 --> 24:10.405
Yeah. I don't think it is.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.668
Great. You're fired.

24:12.712 --> 24:14.714
Sweet. Funemployment!

24:20.241 --> 24:22.678
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Who does she miss? J.R.?

24:25.942 --> 24:27.074
Hi, Mrs. Solano.

24:27.117 --> 24:28.075
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, yes.

24:28.118 --> 24:29.555
You remember Krishna.

24:36.649 --> 24:38.128
Hey, you.

24:38.172 --> 24:39.695
How's life after prison?

24:39.739 --> 24:41.567
Uh, did you get my fruit basket?No.

24:41.610 --> 24:44.700
Oh.  O-One of my temps
was supposed to send you one.

24:44.744 --> 24:46.528
Uh, which is exactly why
I'm calling.

24:46.572 --> 24:48.312
Look.

24:48.356 --> 24:49.792
I feel so guilty
about everything

24:49.836 --> 24:51.359
that happened and, and I--

24:51.402 --> 24:53.535
I miss us.

24:53.579 --> 24:55.624
So what do you say?

24:55.668 --> 24:57.800
Want to come back to work?
Get the gang back together?

24:57.844 --> 25:00.455
Hard pass, Mrs. Solano.

25:00.499 --> 25:01.935
XIOMARA:
Did you talk to River yet?

25:01.978 --> 25:03.937
No, she's still in wardrobe
but as soon as she's out,

25:03.980 --> 25:05.678
I'll straighten her out.

25:05.721 --> 25:07.897
This set needs to be
a place of honor,

25:07.941 --> 25:10.030
respect and dignity.

25:14.556 --> 25:15.775
Because I'm half-human,
half-Martian.

25:15.818 --> 25:17.211
I've started to evolve.

25:17.254 --> 25:19.692
Didn't you read the script?RIVER:
Hello.

25:19.735 --> 25:21.041
Hello.

25:23.739 --> 25:26.350
I'm calm.

25:26.394 --> 25:27.874
But he better
set her straight.

25:27.917 --> 25:29.571
And I'm listening in.

25:31.094 --> 25:33.053
Oh. Your wife is here.

25:33.096 --> 25:35.577
Yes, and I've told her
what happened.

25:35.621 --> 25:37.623
And I'm flattered.

25:37.666 --> 25:40.539
That someone as
spectacularly beautiful

25:40.582 --> 25:42.845
as the incomparable River Fields

25:42.889 --> 25:45.631
would be interested in me.

25:45.674 --> 25:47.502
But alas,

25:47.546 --> 25:48.938
I must make clear

25:48.982 --> 25:52.681
I'm very happily married.

25:52.725 --> 25:55.641
And I'm sorry
if I misled you in any way.

25:55.684 --> 25:57.991
Let's just keep
this relationship professional.

25:59.862 --> 26:02.169
I completely agree.

26:02.212 --> 26:03.736
This show is
too important

26:03.779 --> 26:06.390
to both of us to jeopardize it.

26:06.434 --> 26:08.610
I apologize for overstepping.

26:08.654 --> 26:10.177
It won't happen again.

26:10.220 --> 26:12.483
Professional it is.DIRECTOR:
All right.

26:12.527 --> 26:14.268
Time for you two to have sex.

26:16.705 --> 26:18.620
RAFAEL: Should I be worried about this?

26:18.664 --> 26:20.666
Petra?

26:22.711 --> 26:24.017
Worried about
my personal living space?

26:24.060 --> 26:25.496
Which is none of your business?

26:25.540 --> 26:27.020
You are my business.

26:27.063 --> 26:29.196
And I knew you were doing
some work in the lobby,

26:29.239 --> 26:31.067
but I didn't realize
it was a whole hotel remodel.

26:31.111 --> 26:32.460
It's gonna be expensive.

26:32.503 --> 26:34.114
You want to maybe
talk it through?

26:35.681 --> 26:37.813
The girls are waiting for you
in their room.

26:37.857 --> 26:39.728
I am just worried that you're
getting in over your head.

26:39.772 --> 26:42.209
Permits alone are gonna be
a huge expense.

26:42.252 --> 26:44.690
Would that be worth it
for maybe 10% growth?

26:44.733 --> 26:46.779
I know it's
a big investment, Rafael.

26:46.822 --> 26:48.650
I don't need you to mansplain
hotel finance to me.

26:48.694 --> 26:50.652
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And from mansplaining...

26:50.696 --> 26:53.307
to Marsplaining.

26:53.350 --> 26:55.309
Our scientists have
finally figured out how

26:55.352 --> 26:58.486
to support all forms of life
in the Martian atmosphere.

26:58.529 --> 27:01.184
The first Martian flower
was just the beginning.

27:01.228 --> 27:05.188
In our man-made lake,
we have the first Martian shark.

27:05.232 --> 27:06.886
And I've saved
the best news for last.

27:06.929 --> 27:09.192
We will name it Lake Brenda.

27:09.236 --> 27:12.152
After the first
co-president of Mars.

27:12.195 --> 27:14.807
I think we should
properly christen

27:14.850 --> 27:17.636
this lake by
making love in it.

27:32.781 --> 27:33.695
Cut.

27:33.739 --> 27:35.610
Hmm!

27:35.654 --> 27:37.090
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
That's definitely not
in the script.

27:37.133 --> 27:39.309
Get your hands off my man,

27:39.353 --> 27:41.355
you horny Martian bitch!

27:41.398 --> 27:43.705
Cut!

27:48.928 --> 27:52.061
ROGELIO:
Somebody stop them. Stop, stop!

27:52.105 --> 27:54.063
No! Stop.

27:54.107 --> 27:56.500
Somebody stop them.
ALBA:
No, Xiomara.

27:56.544 --> 27:58.546
ROGELIO: No!LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Watch out, Xo.

27:58.589 --> 28:00.156
Jump over that shark.

28:00.200 --> 28:01.810
Stop! Stop, stop.

28:01.854 --> 28:04.247
Xiomara, stop.
Please stop. No, no, no, no.

28:04.291 --> 28:07.555
What were you
thinking?

28:07.598 --> 28:08.730
Why don't you ask that

28:08.774 --> 28:10.340
woman who was
groping you?

28:10.384 --> 28:12.038
It's called acting!

28:12.081 --> 28:13.604
Yeah, right. They called "cut."

28:13.648 --> 28:14.997
I didn't hear it.

28:15.041 --> 28:16.651
Maybe that's because
you were too busy trying

28:16.695 --> 28:19.436
to get a piece of tail,
you home wrecker.Okay. Come here.

28:19.480 --> 28:21.395
Come here, come here.
Come on, let's go.

28:22.875 --> 28:25.399
Xiomara, this is
my place of work.

28:25.442 --> 28:26.661
Exactly.

28:26.705 --> 28:28.576
So why is your costar
dry humping you

28:28.619 --> 28:29.751
in front of everyone?

28:29.795 --> 28:32.014
We have a lot of
material to shoot today.

28:32.058 --> 28:33.450
We'll talk later.Excuse me?

28:33.494 --> 28:35.452
Why don't you go cool
off in my dressing room?

28:36.497 --> 28:38.804
JANE:
Inhala, exhala.

28:42.024 --> 28:43.765
Uh, Mateo.

28:43.809 --> 28:45.811
This is important.These breathing
exercises

28:45.854 --> 28:47.987
will make it easier for
you to pay attention

28:48.030 --> 28:49.989
to your school work,
but you need to focus.I can't.

28:50.032 --> 28:51.468
I'm too bored.

28:51.512 --> 28:53.209
Sounds like you need to
burn off a little energy.

28:53.253 --> 28:56.169
What do you say we run around
the block a few times

28:56.212 --> 28:58.214
while Daddy
finishes cooking?I'm sick of running

28:58.258 --> 29:01.174
and I don't want
Daddy's gross food.

29:01.217 --> 29:03.263
If you finish your exercises
and eat dinner,

29:03.306 --> 29:05.221
you can have a chocolate bar.
How's that?

29:05.265 --> 29:07.484
I don't want
a disgusting fake candy bar.

29:07.528 --> 29:09.399
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Uh-oh, looks like he's having
another "meldooper."

29:09.443 --> 29:10.661
I never get real dessert.

29:10.705 --> 29:12.185
Or even chicken nuggets...Try to calm down.

29:12.228 --> 29:13.795
...or anything good.Please, Mateo.

29:13.839 --> 29:15.579
If you make me run
to school again,

29:15.623 --> 29:17.103
I'm running away
from home!
Just take a
deep breath.

29:17.146 --> 29:18.669
No, I don't want
to do this anymore.

29:18.713 --> 29:20.410
Well, neither do I.

29:21.455 --> 29:23.718
I need a time out.

29:23.762 --> 29:26.677
You know what?
I think we all need a break.

29:26.721 --> 29:28.679
Here, play with this.

29:28.723 --> 29:30.507
Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes.

29:30.551 --> 29:33.162
I need some air.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.302
He's right.

29:42.345 --> 29:43.869
I can't do this.

29:43.912 --> 29:47.307
I can't run with him
to school anymore.

29:47.350 --> 29:49.352
I'm exhausted and
we're always late.

29:49.396 --> 29:51.615
Then there's the
logs, his diet;

29:51.659 --> 29:53.617
I just feel
like I'm always

29:53.661 --> 29:55.141
studying him and
disciplining him.

29:55.184 --> 29:56.751
So let's stop.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.100
We can't.
Why not?

29:58.144 --> 30:01.147
Because we have to help
him however we can.

30:01.190 --> 30:02.539
Yeah, agreed.

30:02.583 --> 30:04.367
However we can.

30:04.411 --> 30:06.195
And we can't evaluate

30:06.239 --> 30:07.718
if the behavior therapy
is actually working

30:07.762 --> 30:10.591
unless it's something
that we can sustain long term.

30:10.634 --> 30:12.636
And we can't
sustain this.

30:12.680 --> 30:14.334
I just want to do
everything possible.

30:14.377 --> 30:15.726
Don't we owe him that?

30:15.770 --> 30:17.250
We are.

30:17.293 --> 30:18.817
And we will.

30:18.860 --> 30:21.558
But we also
have to enjoy our son.

30:21.602 --> 30:23.256
And live our lives.

30:26.781 --> 30:28.565
Let's just relax
the food rules

30:28.609 --> 30:30.350
on the weekends.

30:30.393 --> 30:32.569
Let him have cake
at birthday parties.

30:32.613 --> 30:34.920
Yeah.

30:34.963 --> 30:36.660
Okay.

30:36.704 --> 30:38.706
No more
running to school.Oh, thank God.

30:38.749 --> 30:40.969
Mm. Let's throw out
that stupid notebook.

30:41.013 --> 30:42.971
I love the notebook.

30:43.015 --> 30:45.060
Can't we just
keep the notebook?

30:50.457 --> 30:53.242
This is nice out here.

30:53.286 --> 30:55.114
Yeah, I needed this.

30:58.204 --> 31:00.206
So? How'd your date go?

31:03.078 --> 31:05.254
Not bad.
Cool.

31:05.298 --> 31:07.082
What does
"not bad" mean?

31:07.126 --> 31:09.780
That I don't want
to get into it.
Gotcha.
Understood.

31:09.824 --> 31:13.349
I will tell you if
there's something worth telling.

31:13.393 --> 31:15.351
Perfect.

31:16.439 --> 31:17.658
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Aw.

31:17.701 --> 31:21.053
Look at them. So mature.

31:21.096 --> 31:22.619
Less mature...

31:22.663 --> 31:24.099
I'm sorry
for my outburst.

31:24.143 --> 31:27.363
But River Fields is after you.

31:27.407 --> 31:29.148
You have to believe me.

31:29.191 --> 31:31.150
Xiomara, she just got
caught up with the scene.

31:31.193 --> 31:32.586
Please, let this go.

31:34.805 --> 31:36.938
Can we talk?

31:39.810 --> 31:42.204
I want to apologize.

31:42.248 --> 31:44.293
I honestly did not hear

31:44.337 --> 31:45.686
the director call "cut."

31:45.729 --> 31:47.862
But beyond that,

31:47.906 --> 31:50.778
I should never have
kissed your husband.

31:50.821 --> 31:54.738
And even though what I did
is totally unforgivable,

31:54.782 --> 31:56.915
I still wanted
to apologize to you.

31:56.958 --> 31:59.091
Sometimes I get
caught up

31:59.134 --> 32:01.397
in the fantasy.

32:01.441 --> 32:03.573
I lose myself in the role

32:03.617 --> 32:05.532
and...
as pathetic

32:05.575 --> 32:09.884
as it sounds, I start
to believe what I'm feeling.

32:09.928 --> 32:12.669
It's a combination of...
being method

32:12.713 --> 32:15.498
and...
and, well,

32:15.542 --> 32:16.978
being a little lonely,

32:17.022 --> 32:19.676
if I'm...
if I'm being honest.

32:19.720 --> 32:21.678
But it's no excuse.

32:21.722 --> 32:24.203
And nothing like that
will ever happen again.

32:24.246 --> 32:25.726
You have my word.

32:25.769 --> 32:28.947
Okay, then thank you
for saying that.

32:30.731 --> 32:33.429
I'll-I'll get out of your hair.

32:33.473 --> 32:35.257
I'll see you
at home?
Yes.

32:40.871 --> 32:42.047
Thank you for doing that.

32:42.090 --> 32:44.092
No problem.

32:46.921 --> 32:48.662
Oh!

32:48.705 --> 32:49.750
You slapped me?

32:49.793 --> 32:50.881
Uh!

32:50.925 --> 32:52.144
Well, you kissed me!

32:52.187 --> 32:54.755
Because your wife bought
our cover story.

32:54.798 --> 32:55.974
Our what?

32:56.017 --> 32:57.932
There is no cover story.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.281
Let me make this
perfectly clear.

32:59.325 --> 33:00.891
I love my wife.

33:00.935 --> 33:02.241
I don't want
to have sex with you,

33:02.284 --> 33:04.112
I have never wanted
to have sex with you,

33:04.156 --> 33:05.809
and if you keep trying
to have sex with me,

33:05.853 --> 33:07.028
I'm going to HR,

33:07.072 --> 33:08.247
and if they don't
pay attention,

33:08.290 --> 33:10.945
I'll go to Alyssa Milano.

33:17.517 --> 33:19.998
ALBA: Jorge...

33:25.481 --> 33:27.875
Hey. I need a place to stay.

33:27.918 --> 33:30.269
Yeah, sure. Come in.
I just need to make a call.

33:30.312 --> 33:32.053
My last temp screwed up
my injunction,

33:32.097 --> 33:34.055
and now Milos is blocking
the hotel renovation.

33:34.099 --> 33:36.840
Well, maybe that's for the best.

33:36.884 --> 33:38.625
It'll give you time to think
about whether you really

33:38.668 --> 33:40.670
want to go
ahead with it.

33:42.281 --> 33:43.412
Rafael talked to you.

33:43.456 --> 33:45.066
He may have mentioned it,

33:45.110 --> 33:47.286
but that's not
the point. I...

33:47.329 --> 33:48.809
I'm worried that
this renovation

33:48.852 --> 33:51.072
is just one big, old
distraction from J.R.

33:51.116 --> 33:52.595
Yeah, of course it is.

33:52.639 --> 33:53.770
Everywhere I look,
I see reminders of her.

33:53.814 --> 33:54.771
I can't take it.

33:54.815 --> 33:56.469
So you're gonna...

33:56.512 --> 33:58.732
redecorate her
out of your memory?Exactly.

33:58.775 --> 34:00.647
As soon as I get
that injunction.

34:00.690 --> 34:02.040
Judge Judy stayed here
last month with her grandkids.

34:02.083 --> 34:03.171
I'll give her a call.

34:03.215 --> 34:04.868
Eh... It's 11:00 on a weeknight.

34:04.912 --> 34:06.566
You cannot call
Judge Judy right now.

34:06.609 --> 34:08.089
Of course I can!
Give it to me.

34:08.133 --> 34:09.960
Not a chance.
I am your friend,

34:10.004 --> 34:12.006
and I am not giving this phone
back until you agree

34:12.050 --> 34:13.138
to stop
bankrupting yourself

34:13.181 --> 34:15.183
to erase J.R.

34:18.230 --> 34:21.842
It's not just about erasing her.

34:21.885 --> 34:23.148
I want her back.

34:23.191 --> 34:24.975
But I can't have her.

34:25.019 --> 34:27.021
And I feel totally
out of control and powerless,

34:27.065 --> 34:28.849
and I don't know
what to do with myself

34:28.892 --> 34:31.330
and I have to do something
or I'm going to explode.

34:31.373 --> 34:33.549
Get your sneakers.

34:33.593 --> 34:35.290
PETRA:
Why are we doing this again?

34:35.334 --> 34:38.293
When your emotions and
energy levels are too high,

34:38.337 --> 34:39.729
heavy exercise can help.

34:39.773 --> 34:41.818
It's not.
Yeah. Keep running.

34:41.862 --> 34:43.777
I don't know if you've ever been
heartbroken before.

34:43.820 --> 34:44.778
Have you?

34:44.821 --> 34:46.214
Not like this.

34:46.258 --> 34:47.955
Not even close.
I blame you.

34:47.998 --> 34:49.391
Of course you do.

34:49.435 --> 34:50.653
For what, exactly?

34:50.697 --> 34:52.002
Well, I never
believed in

34:52.046 --> 34:53.917
this sappy destiny
stuff before.

34:53.961 --> 34:56.616
And for a while there,
because of you,

34:56.659 --> 34:58.835
I actually thought
J.R. was my...

34:58.879 --> 34:59.923
happily ever after.

34:59.967 --> 35:01.621
Well, if it helps,

35:01.664 --> 35:03.144
I'm over that now.

35:03.188 --> 35:04.145
I thought
Rafael and I

35:04.189 --> 35:05.538
would make it,

35:05.581 --> 35:07.453
but I might change
the end of my book

35:07.496 --> 35:10.412
so the heroine ends up
living with her abuela.

35:10.456 --> 35:11.979
Okay.

35:12.022 --> 35:13.502
That makes no sense.

35:13.546 --> 35:16.070
And I'm done.

35:17.941 --> 35:20.770
Why would the heroine
live with her grandmother?

35:20.814 --> 35:23.860
She's a grown-ass woman.

35:23.904 --> 35:26.036
Can't she move out
even if she doesn't get the guy?

35:27.951 --> 35:29.301
Yeah, I guess she can.

35:29.344 --> 35:31.085
So why hasn't she?

35:32.739 --> 35:33.914
I don't know.

35:33.957 --> 35:35.872
Maybe she was waiting

35:35.916 --> 35:38.875
for things to change.

35:38.919 --> 35:41.095
Is she done waiting?

35:43.924 --> 35:45.882
Yeah, she is.

35:45.926 --> 35:47.928
And is she ready
to not renovate?

35:47.971 --> 35:49.886
No, I'm-I'm not she.
You're she.

35:49.930 --> 35:51.149
Fine, fine.

35:51.192 --> 35:52.150
Are you?

35:53.977 --> 35:56.328
Bankrupting myself
probably isn't the...

35:56.371 --> 35:59.026
healthiest way to get over J.R.

36:11.081 --> 36:12.822
Well, you were right. Uh...

36:12.866 --> 36:14.433
River kissed me again.

36:14.476 --> 36:16.043
I knew it.

36:16.086 --> 36:17.914
I'm sorry.
I told her off--

36:17.958 --> 36:19.612
in no uncertain terms,
this time.

36:19.655 --> 36:21.222
Good!

36:21.266 --> 36:23.572
And you're not allowed to do any
sex scenes with her anymore.

36:23.616 --> 36:25.966
Xiomara, she plays my wife.

36:26.009 --> 36:27.576
Sex scenes are involved.

36:27.620 --> 36:30.144
Then I'm gonna be there,
watching like a hawk.

36:30.188 --> 36:31.189
I told her
to back off.

36:31.232 --> 36:32.277
She got the message this time.

36:32.320 --> 36:33.843
I'm still coming.You can't.

36:33.887 --> 36:35.193
Why not?Because you
being there

36:35.236 --> 36:36.716
will make the situation worse.

36:36.759 --> 36:37.978
Well, it's gonna be worse, then,

36:38.021 --> 36:39.675
because I'll be there.You are not.

36:39.719 --> 36:40.720
I forbid it.

36:40.763 --> 36:42.025
You forbid it?

36:42.069 --> 36:43.636
Oh, excuse me,

36:43.679 --> 36:45.986
I didn't realize
we were back in the cave!

36:46.029 --> 36:48.031
My work pays for this cave.

36:48.075 --> 36:49.729
And I will not let you
jeopardize my job

36:49.772 --> 36:51.513
because you're jealous
and insecure.

36:51.557 --> 36:53.036
Go to hell, Rogelio!

36:53.080 --> 36:54.255
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Uh-oh. Looks like someone's

36:54.299 --> 36:55.343
the man of the doghouse.

37:00.827 --> 37:03.569
Okay, I'm sorry.
Come back.

37:03.612 --> 37:04.570
Xiomara, don't leave!

37:09.227 --> 37:11.533
Wh-What is wrong?
Why are you smiling?

37:11.577 --> 37:15.233
You called me jealous
and insecure.

37:15.276 --> 37:16.973
And it hit me that...

37:17.017 --> 37:18.453
that's true!

37:18.497 --> 37:20.890
I am jealous
and insecure!

37:20.934 --> 37:23.806
And even though
that's a crappy feeling...

37:24.851 --> 37:27.636
...that's a normal feeling.

37:27.680 --> 37:30.639
Normal like before I had cancer.

37:30.683 --> 37:32.902
You're right.

37:32.946 --> 37:35.601
And I yelled at you
for being jealous and insecure!

37:35.644 --> 37:37.037
I know!

37:37.080 --> 37:38.995
You never would have yelled
at me before the PET scan.

37:39.039 --> 37:41.433
Oh...

37:41.476 --> 37:43.391
We're getting back to normal.

37:43.435 --> 37:45.959
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Unlike Rogelio's last kiss,

37:46.002 --> 37:48.918
this is a very wanted advance.

37:48.962 --> 37:50.137
Thank you for yelling at me.

37:50.180 --> 37:52.661
I'm prepared to yell
at you all night long.

37:52.705 --> 37:55.055
And after a five-year
rest period,

37:55.098 --> 37:57.057
I'll be ready to yell
at you some more.

37:57.100 --> 37:59.015
Oh, I plan to yell, too.

37:59.059 --> 38:01.279
And yes, friends,
that's how Xo and Ro

38:01.322 --> 38:03.281
got their groove back.

38:04.543 --> 38:06.719
Not feeling so groovy...

38:20.036 --> 38:21.995
Don't call her, Petra.

38:22.038 --> 38:24.519
You're moving forward,
remember?

38:28.958 --> 38:31.744
P-Please. No...
It's been torture,

38:31.787 --> 38:33.006
not having you here.

38:33.049 --> 38:34.921
Look, I-I... I need you back.

38:34.964 --> 38:37.532
What we have doesn't come around
every day.

38:37.576 --> 38:39.578
So much for
Petra's fresh start.

38:39.621 --> 38:41.362
And you picked up the phone.

38:41.406 --> 38:43.059
Look, you wouldn't
have done that

38:43.103 --> 38:45.410
if a small part of you
didn't miss me, too.

38:46.976 --> 38:49.414
So what will it take
for you to come back to me?

38:49.457 --> 38:51.633
I'd consider it

38:51.677 --> 38:53.156
for triple my salary.

38:53.200 --> 38:55.115
Done.
You're worth every penny.

38:55.158 --> 38:58.336
And way cheaper than renovating the entire hotel.

38:58.379 --> 39:01.034
And I want a lunch hour
every day.

39:01.077 --> 39:02.252
Every day?

39:02.296 --> 39:03.950
Good-bye, Mrs. Solano.

39:03.993 --> 39:04.994
It's a deal.

39:05.038 --> 39:05.995
But you start tomorrow.

39:06.039 --> 39:08.258
See you then.

39:10.391 --> 39:14.003
Well, at least she got
one of her exes back.

39:14.047 --> 39:17.093
And continuing
our apology tour...

39:17.137 --> 39:19.922
And, again,
I'm just so sorry.

39:19.966 --> 39:22.925
It's your life, and I had
no right to criticize it.

39:29.671 --> 39:31.673
Oh, you don't have
to explain anything.

39:59.353 --> 40:01.399
I'm glad.

40:05.141 --> 40:07.143
Yeah, but it's
a good one.

40:07.187 --> 40:09.319
And it made me realize

40:09.363 --> 40:11.713
it's time for a change
for me, too.

40:12.627 --> 40:15.413
So... I'm moving out.

40:17.980 --> 40:19.547
I know.

40:19.591 --> 40:21.419
But what am I waiting for?

40:21.462 --> 40:23.421
Mateo and I will get a studio,

40:23.464 --> 40:25.031
which is what
I can afford right now.

40:25.074 --> 40:26.641
Down the road,
hopefully something bigger.

40:29.949 --> 40:31.603
I don't.

40:31.646 --> 40:33.953
I just think it's time
for the next phase in my life.

40:35.433 --> 40:36.999
GIANT BASS:
For what it's worth,

40:37.043 --> 40:39.175
I totally agree.

40:39.219 --> 40:41.961
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And speaking of moving forward
with life...

40:42.004 --> 40:45.094
So... last night was nice.

40:45.138 --> 40:47.749
So was this
morning.

40:47.793 --> 40:49.882
It was.

40:51.536 --> 40:54.060
But it didn't exactly solve

40:54.103 --> 40:56.149
all my insecurity
and jealousy.

40:57.803 --> 40:59.021
I know.

40:59.065 --> 41:01.328
And you can come to set
if you want to.

41:01.371 --> 41:03.069
I don't want to.

41:03.112 --> 41:05.027
But that's the thing.

41:05.071 --> 41:07.073
I want to get my own life
back on track.

41:07.116 --> 41:09.684
Figure out what comes next.

41:09.728 --> 41:12.121
And I want to trust you.

41:12.165 --> 41:13.862
I should trust you.

41:13.906 --> 41:16.517
Well, I should have trusted you

41:16.561 --> 41:19.912
when you said you felt like
River didn't get the message.

41:19.955 --> 41:22.044
But I promise you, Xiomara,

41:22.088 --> 41:23.916
she got it this time.

41:23.959 --> 41:27.093
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
True, for the record.

41:27.136 --> 41:30.662
But while Rogelio's home life
might be back to normal...

41:35.580 --> 41:39.366
...his work life is about
to get very uncomfortable.

41:39.409 --> 41:41.411
He loves me not.

41:43.326 --> 41:45.328
He will pay.

41:46.504 --> 41:49.289
He loves me not.

41:49.332 --> 41:50.508
He will pay.
