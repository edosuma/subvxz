00:00.200 --> 00:03.000
???

00:03.100 --> 00:03.900
I still want a dog.

00:04.100 --> 00:07.300
I've stiot our name on the list to get
one of those guide dogs.

00:07.400 --> 00:11.200
Did you tell Mom to ask Jack to do this

00:11.300 --> 00:12.400
Is that a problem?

00:12.500 --> 00:15.100
I'm the maof the house.
I fix things.

00:15.200 --> 00:18.300
I think Tom's a little upset
that we asked Jack to do this.

00:18.400 --> 00:20.400
Throw the ball arounwith him
and he'll be fine.

00:20.500 --> 00:22.200
We actually get the keys in 30 days?

00:22.300 --> 00:25.300
So y've got 30 days to get everything
straightened out with Amy.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.600
Why can't you just tell her
that's yr soon too and I can hold him?

00:27.600 --> 00:28.700
if you want me to hold him

00:28.800 --> 00:30.800
I think Jack???

00:30.900 --> 00:34.000
I thought you and I were going to start
over and try to make things work.

00:34.100 --> 00:36.100
we can???

00:36.200 --> 00:37.600
Think fast.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.100
How was that, buddy?

00:42.200 --> 00:44.200
I'm really sorry you called me a slut

00:44.300 --> 00:45.600
and got suspended from school.

00:45.700 --> 00:47.500
That's your idea of an apology?

00:47.600 --> 00:49.400
I ready know you don't want us
to move back in here.

00:49.500 --> 00:50.600
No.I don't.

00:50.700 --> 00:53.700
You're about to move next door
to the mother of your boyfriend's child.

00:53.800 --> 00:54.800
So we're getting a brother?

00:54.900 --> 00:56.300
yeah???it's a boy

00:56.400 --> 00:58.100
Now we're having a son

Hi.

01:22.600 --> 01:23.400
Hi.

01:24.400 --> 01:27.600
I just wondering if maybe
you waed to hang out this weekend.

01:28.500 --> 01:30.400
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

01:30.500 --> 01:33.000
I'm a???

01:33.100 --> 01:35.500
I just this seems kind of sudden.

01:36.100 --> 01:37.000
Have we met bere?

01:37.100 --> 01:39.900
It's not you baby???

01:40.100 --> 01:41.200
Oh???no???

01:41.300 --> 01:42.600
It was a joke.

01:43.800 --> 01:47.000
I just thought, you know,
you must be into pregnant girls and

01:47.800 --> 01:49.000
I could use a friend.

01:49.700 --> 01:51.900
You don't seem have
any issues with single mothers.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.500
I'm so sorry,what's you name?

01:53.600 --> 01:55.600
- Heather.
- Nice to meet you. I'm Ben.

01:55.700 --> 01:56.500
I know

01:56.600 --> 01:57.800
I have a girlfriend,

01:57.900 --> 02:01.900
and it sounds like you
know I have a girlfriend.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.100
Do you know I havea girlfriend? Amy Juer

02:04.200 --> 02:05.200
yeah,so???

02:05.700 --> 02:07.800
She's probably going to end up
with Ricky anyway

02:08.300 --> 02:09.500
no harm in coming out.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.600
Well, I don't think she's
going to end up with Ricky

02:12.700 --> 02:13.500
She could.

02:13.600 --> 02:15.100
He's the father of her baby.

02:15.200 --> 02:16.000
I love Amy.

02:16.100 --> 02:18.400
we are???

02:18.500 --> 02:21.800
Oh, I'm sure. You and Amy
and the baby and Ricky

02:22.400 --> 02:25.000
look???

02:25.100 --> 02:26.300
You want to have a good time, right?

02:26.400 --> 02:28.900
Really, Heather, I can't.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.400
You can't have a good time

02:30.900 --> 02:33.700
Well, I can, but only with Amy.

02:33.800 --> 02:36.900
All right,if that's your idea of
a good time, getting your heart broken.

02:38.300 --> 02:39.600
My parents already
kicked me out of my house,

02:39.600 --> 02:41.400
so I have my own place.

02:41.500 --> 02:42.800
Here's my number.

02:42.900 --> 02:44.100
You should give me a call.

02:44.300 --> 02:46.800
Oh, and I heard you like to play cribbage.

02:47.300 --> 02:50.400
So do I. Maybe we coulde friends.

02:51.500 --> 02:53.500
Doesn't it botheyou hanging out with Amy

02:53.600 --> 02:55.400
and Ricky and the baby
all the time?

02:55.500 --> 02:59.500
Heather, it occurs t that
even if I did want to hang out with you,

02:59.600 --> 03:03.600
wouldn't it just be me with the father
of your baby anyour baby?

03:03.900 --> 03:05.500
Wouldn't it be the same thing?

03:05.600 --> 03:06.900
Ye, only way better.

03:08.300 --> 03:09.600
I'll see you around.

03:14.500 --> 03:16.100
I'm seeing a pattern here.

03:16.800 --> 03:18.500
You're not going to go out
with her, are you?

03:18.600 --> 03:20.000
Are you going to be friends with her?

03:20.100 --> 03:20.700
No.

03:20.800 --> 03:21.800
Come on.

03:21.900 --> 03:23.900
That was a cry for help
if I've ever seen one.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.200
I could be her friend,I guess.

03:25.300 --> 03:27.200
No, you can't.
Not and be Amy's boyfriend.

03:27.300 --> 03:28.900
All right,Amy knows our friends.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.200
oh,the two of us

03:31.300 --> 03:32.700
Okay, that's my t exactly.

03:32.800 --> 03:35.300
Amy knows I'm friends with yAlison.
She doesn't mind.

03:35.400 --> 03:36.300
What does that mean?

03:36.500 --> 03:40.900
It means that Amy is fine
with my having friends of the opposite se

03:41.000 --> 03:42.700
- I???
- yeah

03:42.800 --> 03:43.900
Come on, Amy would be fine.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.600
In fact, maybe Amy and I
can be friends with--

03:47.100 --> 03:48.300
Hather. Her name is Heather.

03:48.400 --> 03:50.200
Amy's not too happy about
your beingends with Adrian.

03:50.300 --> 03:52.000
What makes you think you can
be friends with Heather?

03:52.100 --> 03:54.400
I'm not really friends
with Adrian anymore.

03:54.500 --> 03:56.800
We useto talk,
but hardly ever anymore.

03:57.100 --> 03:59.400
And I see your point,
but this is different.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.500
Yeah. You don't even know this girl

04:01.600 --> 04:02.500
What girl?

04:03.200 --> 04:05.400
Me. He was referring to me.

04:08.100 --> 04:09.300
What girl?

04:09.500 --> 04:10.900
This girl named Heather.

04:11.300 --> 04:12.700
The pregnant girl?

04:34.200 --> 04:36.000
Grace,I don't think???

04:36.100 --> 04:37.400
It's time, Jack.

04:37.500 --> 04:38.700
It's a mistake.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.200
I really want to.

04:40.800 --> 04:42.200
I think I uld
feel better if I did.

04:42.300 --> 04:45.100
I imagine that the Catholi
confess in private for a reason.

04:45.200 --> 04:46.200
???

04:46.500 --> 04:47.600
become???

04:47.700 --> 04:51.700
How is anyone in the teen abstinence grou going
to know we regret what we did unle we tell them?

04:51.900 --> 04:54.800
We've just been sitting there
week after school started.

04:54.800 --> 04:56.700
I know they're waiting for us to speak.

04:56.800 --> 04:58.800
They're look at us to be the leaders.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.900
so???We're speaking,

05:01.000 --> 05:02.500
and I'm inviting everyone I know.

05:02.600 --> 05:03.400
Mistake.

05:03.500 --> 05:05.700
How is it a mistake
to talk about a mistake?

05:05.800 --> 05:07.900
I don't know, Grace,
but my gut tells me it is.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.400
People don't want to know
that we gret having sex.

05:10.500 --> 05:13.000
Right. They don't want
to know that we regret i

05:13.100 --> 05:14.400
because then they can justify doing it

05:14.500 --> 05:16.400
because we did it.

05:16.800 --> 05:18.200
It's time for us to witness.

05:18.300 --> 05:19.000
Mistak--

05:19.100 --> 05:20.200
Stop saying that.

05:20.300 --> 05:21.300
Mistake.

05:23.500 --> 05:24.600
How's the grn injury?

05:24.700 --> 05:26.200
I don't want talk about it

05:26.300 --> 05:28.100
Just so you know,
everything's working just fine.

05:28.200 --> 05:29.900
Jack Pappas, I hope you're not--

05:30.000 --> 05:30.800
It was just the one time.

05:30.900 --> 05:32.900
I wanted to make sure everything was okay.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.400
it won't happen again

05:36.200 --> 05:37.800
All right, all right,
it'll probably happen again.

05:37.900 --> 05:40.000
This is why you need group support.

05:40.300 --> 05:41.900
Oh, no, I'm not talking
about that either.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.200
- Too.
- Eith

05:43.300 --> 05:45.700
I'm not talking about
either one of those th.

05:47.400 --> 05:50.600
It'll be fine, Jack. I promise.

05:58.100 --> 05:59.700
- Hi.
- No.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.600
No? I don't want something from you.

06:02.700 --> 06:04.100
I want to give you something.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.200
I want to give you my reasons
for not having s.

06:07.400 --> 06:10.600
I'm going to be speaking about
that at my Troup at the church tonight.

06:10.700 --> 06:13.300
- TAG?
- Teen Abstinence Group.

06:13.500 --> 06:14.800
Oh. You ow, I have a group of my own.

06:14.900 --> 06:16.000
Teens Against Groups.

06:16.100 --> 06:17.500
I love your sense of humor.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.000
Anyway, just know that you're inted.

06:19.100 --> 06:19.900
Why don't you bring Amy?

06:20.000 --> 06:21.600
She can bring the baby too, if she wants.

06:21.700 --> 06:23.700
I'll ask her myself.
Bye, Ashley.

06:29.800 --> 06:31.300
Want me to get rid of him?

06:32.000 --> 06:34.300
I don't know. I'm thinking abo it.

06:36.700 --> 06:38.500
- So
- so

06:38.600 --> 06:41.300
So, neither of you are conversationalists.

06:41.400 --> 06:44.200
Maybe ind it awkward
having to talk in front of you.

06:44.300 --> 06:45.800
would you

06:45.900 --> 06:46.800
yes???

06:46.900 --> 06:47.800
I like that.

06:48.300 --> 06:51.800
Ashl's made a commitment
not to date in high school.

06:51.900 --> 06:52.900
I don't wa to go out with her.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.800
I just want to marry
her and have children.

06:54.900 --> 06:55.500
In that order.

06:55.600 --> 06:56.700
Whoa, okay there, buddy.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.800
no no no???You'reot getting
anywhere near her.

06:58.900 --> 07:01.400
I didn't say I was going to.
I just-- I wanted to.

07:01.800 --> 07:04.000
but Who wouldn't? Other than you.

07:04.100 --> 07:06.600
Is that a remark about my being gay

07:06.900 --> 07:09.000
I guess. You are gay, aren't you?

07:09.300 --> 07:10.700
even the whole school know

07:10.800 --> 07:13.500
it's the something wrong

07:13.600 --> 07:15.000
It's kind of personal, isn't it?

07:15.100 --> 07:16.100
It's who I am.

07:16.200 --> 07:17.400
Well, this is who I am.

07:17.500 --> 07:19.800
I???and I just want to talk.

07:20.200 --> 07:22.000
About sleeping with her

07:22.100 --> 07:23.900
Well, as flattering as all this ,

07:24.100 --> 07:25.900
I'm getting boredand I have to get t

07:26.000 --> 07:28.800
- I'll walk you.
- I'm her walker. I'll walk her.

07:28.900 --> 07:31.500
Pleasem starting to feel
very Scarlett O'Hara.

07:31.600 --> 07:32.800
You can both walk me.

07:32.900 --> 07:34.000
Scarlett who?

07:34.100 --> 07:35.300
Gone with the Wind.

07:35.500 --> 07:37.500
Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh.

07:37.600 --> 07:40.400
Tara, that green velvet dress
ma from the curtains.

07:41.800 --> 07:42.500
no???

07:43.600 --> 07:47.500
It's essential you know this film
in orde to get along with Ashley.

07:47.800 --> 07:51.300
ough she wasn't named for Ashley Wilkes.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.400
Never mind.

07:56.400 --> 07:59.700
hey,if???

07:59.900 --> 08:01.300
What mes you think I want to go out?

08:01.400 --> 08:02.700
I've been watching you wathat guy.

08:02.800 --> 08:04.000
You want to go out.

08:04.200 --> 08:05.000
Maybe.

08:05.100 --> 08:07.100
So who's going to dre you? He's a freshman.

08:07.200 --> 08:10.300
And unlike your sister's boyfriend,
I doubt he has a driver.

08:10.400 --> 08:12.100
Well, he hasn't asked me out, so???

08:12.200 --> 08:14.100
Maybe he can't get past your friend.

08:14.800 --> 08:16.700
Well, then he cat go out with me.

08:17.100 --> 08:20.900
Don't you think guys are intimidated
enouthout having to pass the bodyguard?

08:21.300 --> 08:23.400
Intimidated by me? How so?

08:23.500 --> 08:25.900
Don't play games with me.
You know what I'm talking ab

08:26.100 --> 08:26.700
What?

08:27.000 --> 08:28.400
Look, I was just trying to be nice.

08:28.500 --> 08:32.100
If you want to go out,
you can go out with Adrian and me.

08:32.400 --> 08:34.299
- Do you go out?
- We go out.

08:35.400 --> 08:36.700
What's gng on?

08:36.799 --> 08:38.000
This guy's trying to date Ashley,

08:38.100 --> 08:41.600
and I told her if the two of them
want to go out with us sometime, they can.

08:41.700 --> 08:42.500
We're going out?

08:42.600 --> 08:43.700
We could go out.

08:44.600 --> 08:45.700
Yeah, okay.

08:45.800 --> 08:47.600
- Really?
- Sure.

08:47.700 --> 08:48.600
Hey.

08:50.600 --> 08:51.900
Want to go out tonight?

08:52.100 --> 08:53.500
How? You don't drive.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.200
I could havey mom take us.

08:55.600 --> 08:56.200
Oh, I don't know.

08:56.300 --> 08:58.100
That might involve meeting my parents.

08:58.200 --> 08:59.300
Oh, no. My mom's trained.

08:59.400 --> 09:01.700
She's going to sin the car in the driveway.

09:08.500 --> 09:10.700
Why would we let her and
her date go out with us?

09:10.800 --> 09:13.900
Because, Adr you need to find a way
to make Amy your friend.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.300
you makfriends with Ashley,
Amy will come around. They're sists.

09:17.500 --> 09:19.500
ok???I've never had a sist

09:19.700 --> 09:21.600
Aryou sure
that's how it works?

09:21.700 --> 09:24.700
I think I know a little bit more
about women than you do.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.800
Grace, Grace, okay.

09:29.200 --> 09:30.200
Listen to this.

09:30.700 --> 09:33.100
Rickand I are going to let
Ashley and a guy

09:33.200 --> 09:34.700
double date with us.

09:34.800 --> 09:36.100
So you're going out?

09:36.200 --> 09:38.000
Yeah, we're going out.

09:38.300 --> 09:40.400
Okay, but don't you think
Amy's going to hate you more

09:40.500 --> 09:42.000
if you make friends with Ashley?

09:43.300 --> 09:44.100
Yes.

09:44.200 --> 09:46.600
No. Adrian, you're going
in the wrong direction.

09:46.700 --> 09:49.900
Turn around. You can do it.
You and Amy can still be friends

09:50.000 --> 09:51.700
No, we can't.

09:53.800 --> 09:55.800
Okay, I have an idea.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.100
What if you and Ricky

09:57.300 --> 10:00.800
and Ashley and her dat and Amy and Ben
come to myeen abstinence group tonight?

10:00.900 --> 10:02.600
I think it's too late for me
to join that group.

10:02.600 --> 10:05.900
It's never too late.
And I really want you all to hear what I say.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.900
- About?
- A-bout not ng sex before marriage.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.100
Please, Adrian? Please come.

10:11.300 --> 10:14.100
Just to support me. And Jack. As our friend.

10:14.200 --> 10:17.500
It's going to take tremendous courage
for Jack to speak tonight.

10:17.600 --> 10:19.500
Um, excuse me.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.500
I couldn't help but overhearing.

10:21.600 --> 10:23.400
For Jack to speak about what?

10:23.600 --> 10:24.900
Oh, you ould come too, Madison.

10:25.100 --> 10:27.600
I'm going to be speaking
about not having sex my church tonight.

10:27.700 --> 10:31.300
well???I've always thought that you
should never have sex at church, at all.

10:31.500 --> 10:34.200
- Ever
- It's the first time I've talked about it,

10:34.300 --> 10:36.600
you know from the Dead Parents Club meetings th

10:36.900 --> 10:38.900
I deeply regret having sex.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.600
Grace, we all deeply regret you having sex.

10:43.300 --> 10:45.400
I'll let you know about the church thing.

10:45.700 --> 10:48.700
Jeeze, GraYou're a member of the no sex group.

10:48.800 --> 10:50.400
The Dead Parents Club.

10:50.700 --> 10:52.200
Maybe you should go back to cheerleading.

10:52.300 --> 10:54.400
You know, try something a little more fun.

10:59.400 --> 11:00.600
Hey, excuse me. Sorry.

11:00.700 --> 11:01.800
Lauren, can--

11:04.100 --> 11:05.700
Do you know that pregnant girl, Heather?

11:06.100 --> 11:08.300
I know Heather, and I know she's pregnant.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.600
But I don't refer to her as
"that pregnant girl,eather,"

11:10.700 --> 11:14.000
because I know you wouldn't appreciate
people calling you"that preg girl, Amy."

11:14.100 --> 11:15.700
She asked Ben out.

11:16.300 --> 11:18.100
Yeah, I kn. Can you believe that?

11:18.700 --> 11:21.500
Amy, you never want to go out,
you're always tired,

11:21.600 --> 11:24.900
and you can't think that
a guy as cute and popular as B Boykewich

11:24.900 --> 11:28.300
is going to sit around every night watching
you take care of Ricky Underwood's baby.

11:28.400 --> 11:29.500
What?

11:29.600 --> 11:31.000
look???Get a babysitter.

11:31.100 --> 11:32.500
Go out, have some fun,

11:32.600 --> 11:35.200
if???

11:35.600 --> 11:37.900
Hand John over to me and Madison.
We'll baby-sit.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.200
No. You cannot baby-sit.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.900
Does that mean that Ben
can co to my house and play?

11:47.300 --> 11:48.500
All???All right.

11:48.600 --> 11:51.600
I'm???I guess you could baby-sit.

11:53.800 --> 11:54.800
but no Madison.

11:55.400 --> 11:57.300
7, be there at 7.

11:59.100 --> 12:00.300
Where's Amy going?

12:00.600 --> 12:01.600

12:02.000 --> 12:02.900
So what are we doing tonigh

12:03.000 --> 12:04.900
Grace wants us to come

12:05.100 --> 12:06.000
I'm busy.

12:07.600 --> 12:08.800
I have something to do.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.500
Is this role-play in case
some guy you don't like asks you out?

12:12.600 --> 12:13.300
No???

12:13.400 --> 12:14.800
Well then, what are you doing?

12:15.700 --> 12:16.800
I'm babysitting.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.900

I'll let you in.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.700
Unless her mom stops me.

12:23.800 --> 12:26.400

with two sluts.

Hey, that slut happens to
the father of my nephew.

14:15.500 --> 14:16.500
umm???my sister would be?

14:16.600 --> 14:19.000
A cautionary tale. Big difference.

He's fine, I'm fine, everything's fine.

14:47.500 --> 14:49.300
Everything's not fine if you're on bed rest.

14:49.400 --> 14:51.500
Everything is fine
as long as I'm on bed rest.

14:51.600 --> 14:54.200
We jusdon't want the baby to get here
earlier than he should. That's all.

14:54.300 --> 14:56.900
What do you mean?Is he trying
to sneak out early?

14:57.000 --> 14:57.600
Kind of.

14:57.700 --> 14:59.600
All right, I am home for the duration.

14:59.700 --> 15:00.800
That could be a month.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.400

15:02.500 --> 15:04.600
- Yes.
- No, you can't.

15:04.700 --> 15:06.100
We'll just get a housekeeper for a few eks.

15:06.200 --> 15:07.700
No, I'm staying here, right here,

15:07.800 --> 15:10.200
and I'll take care of
the house and you and the baby.

15:10.300 --> 15:12.800
That's really nice of you,
but I'd rather have a housekeeper.

15:12.900 --> 15:14.000
You know how I feel about that.

15:14.100 --> 15:15.700
Ye, I know how you feel about that,

15:15.800 --> 15:17.300
but there are a lot of people
that need work,

15:17.400 --> 15:18.500
and we need someone to work,

15:18.600 --> 15:21.600
so we'll just get housekeeper
to come in here for a few weeks.

15:22.400 --> 15:23.400
All right.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.700
Should I finish this,
are we getting a housekeeper?

15:35.800 --> 15:37.000
Well, we're not getting one today.

15:37.100 --> 15:39.000

some person in the house that we doknow.

15:42.900 --> 15:45.100
Okay. Fine.

15:45.800 --> 15:48.400
You can take a few weeks
off from the store and stay with her.

15:48.600 --> 15:51.600
just???you and mom
waitinfor the baby to come.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.500
I'd do it, but I have school
and work and I value my sanity.

15:57.400 --> 15:58.900
I love her, but really?

15:59.100 --> 16:02.000

stay here for evy minute of the day

16:02.100 --> 16:03.700

16:03.800 --> 16:04.600

neither can we.

16:20.200 --> 16:21.700

16:21.800 --> 16:23.400
Dad, I have to go out.

and I have to be a lot of fun.

16:30.900 --> 16:31.700

- If you don't?
- Dad, I'm 16 with a baby of my own.

16:59.200 --> 17:02.000

to decide ether or not I'm going on a date.

17:02.100 --> 17:03.600
You're 16 with a baby of your ow

17:03.700 --> 17:04.900
You don't make good decisions.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.099
We've already established that.

17:18.500 --> 17:19.400
I don't know who Mark is,

17:19.500 --> 17:21.300

You don't ed to hear
teenagers talk about not having sex.

They can't go with utonight.

19:10.800 --> 19:12.400
???

19:12.700 --> 19:14.500
Besides, my mom thinks
it would be good for them.

19:14.600 --> 19:16.100
why???I'm not saying anything

19:16.200 --> 19:17.500
I don't want to risk getting hit again.

19:17.600 --> 19:19.300
I already missed one game as it is.

19:19.400 --> 19:21.100
Maybe the Lord will
move you to speak, Jack.

19:21.200 --> 19:22.400
I don't think so, Grace.

19:22.500 --> 19:25.500
and Do me a favo When you speak,
don't mention me by name.

19:25.600 --> 19:26.500
Be vague.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.900
It'll be fine.

19:29.100 --> 19:30.500
No, it won't.

19:34.400 --> 19:37.300
Hey, we don't have tgo to this, you know.

19:37.600 --> 19:39.600
Ashley???

19:39.700 --> 19:40.500
ne's on bed rest,

19:40.600 --> 19:42.500
so George wants his girls home tonight.

19:42.600 --> 19:43.600
Is she oka

19:43.700 --> 19:46.000
she Okay? She's resting in bed.

19:46.100 --> 19:47.600
That means there's something wrong,
doesn't it?

19:47.700 --> 19:49.900
I don't know

19:50.200 --> 19:54.000
But no one's home,
and we don't have to chaperone yone,

19:54.100 --> 19:56.900
so the two of us
n just stay here for a change.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.800
I told Grace we would come.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.300
Fine,we are go

20:00.700 --> 20:02.300
But we can have sex
befo we go.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.900
I don't know, Adrian. I feel funny having sex
and then just walking into a church.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.300
Why? You don't think
we'ring anything wrong, do you?

20:09.300 --> 20:13.400
No, but still-- I mean, sex and then church
sex and church don't go together.

20:13.400 --> 20:15.000
That's church and state.

20:15.100 --> 20:17.100
Church and state
n't go together.

20:17.500 --> 20:19.100
Maybe when we get back

20:19.100 --> 20:22.400
Isn't her little speech
supposed to talk us out of having sex.

20:22.400 --> 20:24.500
Yeah, but Grace
talking about sex

20:24.500 --> 20:26.400
???

20:27.000 --> 20:29.100
- With Grace?
- I don't want to have sex with Grace.

20:29.100 --> 20:31.200
She's got too many issues.

20:31.500 --> 20:33.900
Issues with sex, huh?

20:34.000 --> 20:35.400
She thought it was great.

20:35.400 --> 20:39.900
She really liked it. It was more fun
than she's ever had.

20:40.400 --> 20:41.700
That's what she told me.

20:41.700 --> 20:44.000
More fun than she's ever had?
Compared to what?

20:44.200 --> 20:45.300
What fun has she ever had?

20:45.300 --> 20:47.400
What fun have we ever had
outside of sex?

20:47.500 --> 20:49.000
Exactly.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.800
We're going to have sex,

20:50.800 --> 20:53.400
then we're going to hear Grace
tell us how wrong it is to have sex,

20:53.400 --> 20:55.700
and then we're going out
and do something fun.

20:55.800 --> 20:58.100
Something more fun
than having sex.

20:58.200 --> 21:00.100
- Like?
- I don't know,

21:00.300 --> 21:02.700
but maybe those
abstinent Christians will tell us.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.100
Look, we've got plenty of time.
Now get in there

21:06.200 --> 21:09.200
Yes, ma'am.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.200
What are you doing?

21:22.100 --> 21:23.700
Why do you look good?

21:23.900 --> 21:26.300
Gee, thanks, Ashley.

21:26.700 --> 21:27.700
I need you
to watch the baby.

21:27.700 --> 21:29.700
Lauren's on her way,
but she's not here yet.

21:29.700 --> 21:32.200
???

21:32.200 --> 21:33.800
But Dad said we all
have to stay home tonight,

21:33.800 --> 21:36.000
so why is Lauren
coming over to baby-sit?

21:36.100 --> 21:37.900
Because I'm not staying home.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.300
I'm going out with Ben.

21:39.400 --> 21:40.700
Well, did Dad say you could?

21:40.700 --> 21:43.300
Please, you live with him.
He tells you what to do.

21:43.300 --> 21:45.400
He doesn live here.
He can't tell me what to do.

21:45.400 --> 21:46.500
What?

21:46.600 --> 21:47.900
I'm going out tonight.

21:47.900 --> 21:51.000
Watch John till Lauren
gets here. Please.

21:52.800 --> 21:53.800
Hold it.

21:53.900 --> 21:56.200
Hold it, hold it.
Amy, what are you doing.

21:56.200 --> 21:58.000
I told you, I'm going out.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.800
If Dad told you not to go out, and you're
going out anyway, he's going to kill you.

22:00.800 --> 22:02.600
Noe's not.
I'm a grown woman.

22:02.600 --> 22:04.100
I'm a mother.
I have a baby.

22:04.100 --> 22:06.300
???

22:06.700 --> 22:08.400
But you are not
a grown woman, Amy

22:08.400 --> 22:10.700
You're a teenager.
You're 16.

22:17.400 --> 22:20.500
Hey, Amy. I get here
as quick as I could. Hey, Ashley.

22:20.500 --> 22:21.700
You're really
going to baby-sit.

22:21.700 --> 22:23.900
Yeah, I can do it.
I'm not stupid.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.700
You are if you baby-sit when
Dad's told Amy she can't go out.

22:27.300 --> 22:28.200
What?

22:28.200 --> 22:31.000
???

22:31.100 --> 22:32.700
And if he's not, he's not going
to take it out on you,

22:32.700 --> 22:34.000
he's going
to take it out on me.

22:34.100 --> 22:35.800
Mom, wait.

22:36.500 --> 22:38.600
???

22:38.600 --> 22:40.400
My parents
already don't like you.

22:40.800 --> 22:42.200
Good night.

22:43.100 --> 22:45.300
I'll being the TAG meeting
with Madison.

22:45.300 --> 22:47.000
We'll call you.

22:54.200 --> 22:57.100
Fine. Now that you screwed
th up for me, you baby-sit.

22:57.100 --> 22:57.800
Amy..

22:57.800 --> 22:59.900
I feel like going out,
and I'm going out.

22:59.900 --> 23:02.500
Don't be stupid.
Ben's not going to run off ???

23:02.500 --> 23:04.000
just because you can't
go out one night.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.700
You can take care of Mom,
you and Dad.

23:05.700 --> 23:07.200
She doesn't even need me here.

23:07.300 --> 23:10.500
And I don'like him thinking
he can come over and tell me what to do.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
Hi.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.400
Ben, Dad told Amy
she can't go out.

23:20.400 --> 23:23.300
- Oh. I didn't know.
- We're going out.

23:23.400 --> 23:25.000
No, Amy.

23:25.100 --> 23:26.400
What's going on?

23:26.400 --> 23:28.600
My dad suddenly thin
he's the boss of me.

23:28.600 --> 23:30.800
???

23:30.900 --> 23:32.900
Amy, we don't have to go out.
We can stay here.

23:32.900 --> 23:34.100
Or, Ben,

23:35.000 --> 23:36.500
you could just go home.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.600
You won't believe
what this guy can do.

23:57.600 --> 24:00.500
He flunked out of the guide dog program,
but really, he's unbelievable.

24:00.600 --> 24:02.400
George, we don't need a dog.

24:02.500 --> 24:03.900
We need person.

24:03.900 --> 24:06.200
A person who can do laundry
and clean house,

24:06.200 --> 24:09.000
and keep me company
and bring me food and water.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.300
He could be trained
to do all that. Probably.

24:11.400 --> 24:13.100
But the most important thing is,
if there's an emergey--

24:13.100 --> 24:16.100
Watch this. Moose, call 911.

24:22.400 --> 24:24.000
911, what's your emergency?

24:24.000 --> 24:25.800
George, he called 911.

24:26.200 --> 24:29.000
People calling 911
who don't need 911

24:29.000 --> 24:31.600
keep people who do need 911
from getting help.

24:31.700 --> 24:33.300
A boy needs a dog.

24:33.400 --> 24:34.800
Are we talking about
you or the baby.

24:34.800 --> 24:35.900
Both.

24:36.100 --> 24:37.900
We don't need a dog.

24:44.000 --> 24:49.200
And now, I turn
tonight's program over ???

24:49.400 --> 24:51.700
???

24:58.700 --> 25:01.000
Hey, Adrian.

25:07.500 --> 25:09.500
Now my mom thinks
I'm going on a date with you.

25:09.500 --> 25:12.300
- You could do a lot worse.
- ???

25:12.300 --> 25:15.100
Don't worry. No one here
cares who's gay or not gay

25:15.100 --> 25:18.200
I first want to start by welcoming
all the newcomers here tonight,

25:18.500 --> 25:19.800
especially Griffin.

25:19.800 --> 25:21.900
Especially? What's that
supposed to mean.

25:21.900 --> 25:23.500
???

25:23.500 --> 25:26.300
Oh, almost forgot. And Mark.
Welcome, Mark.

25:27.100 --> 25:28.400
What's that
supposed to mean?

25:28.500 --> 25:31.500
That you're with me.
Embrace the challenge, dude.

25:31.600 --> 25:33.800
Let me start with a little poem
I've written...

25:33.800 --> 25:36.200
called "I'm Sorry, Jesus."

25:36.300 --> 25:38.700
- ???
- ???

25:39.100 --> 25:42.300
Better hope Jack doest tell Jesus
how sorry he is.

25:45.600 --> 25:48.400
I'm sorry, Jesus,
but I had sex.

25:48.700 --> 25:51.300
I don't know what happened.
It's so complex.

25:51.600 --> 25:53.800
I promised I would wait
until I was wed.

25:53.900 --> 25:56.900
and then dte that promise,
I ended up in bed.

25:57.400 --> 25:59.700
I never thought anything
could feel so good

25:59.700 --> 26:02.500
I thought maybe wives just do it
cause they think they should.

26:03.300 --> 26:05.100
But after all
was said and done,

26:05.300 --> 26:08.000
I did feel guilty
for having so much fun.

26:08.300 --> 26:10.200
So now I'm focused
on being a surgeon,

26:10.300 --> 26:12.800
as a way to not think about
not being a virgin.

26:17.300 --> 26:19.400
It's not really
a serious poem.

26:19.500 --> 26:21.000
It's more of a limerick.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.800
I wanted to open
with a joke,

26:24.800 --> 26:26.600
but when I Googled
"Christian jokes on sex,"

26:26.600 --> 26:28.200
I couldn't find anything.

26:30.700 --> 26:32.000
Lighten up, people.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.400
???

26:35.400 --> 26:37.400
I'm laughing.

26:37.700 --> 26:38.900
???

26:38.900 --> 26:40.800
Boo.

26:41.100 --> 26:42.500
Come on I'm just
trying to use humor

26:42.500 --> 26:45.400
before getting to the more serious stuff
that I wanted to talk toou about.

26:45.400 --> 26:47.600
- You failed
- Boo.

26:47.600 --> 26:49.200
I'm not afraid to fail.

26:49.200 --> 26:51.800
I'm not afraid to fall.because I believe
somebody greater will catch me.

26:51.800 --> 26:54.500
Is that how Jack
got the groin injury?

26:57.000 --> 26:59.300
Nice, new guy.
Nice.

26:59.500 --> 27:01.000
Get off the stage.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.900
I'm just getting started

27:04.300 --> 27:05.500
Oh, no

27:05.600 --> 27:07.400
I suddenly got
really turned on.

27:07.500 --> 27:09.000
From what?

27:10.200 --> 27:11.200
I knew this would happen.

27:11.200 --> 27:12.500
No, you didn't.

27:12.500 --> 27:14.100
No one knew
this would happen.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.500
???

27:17.500 --> 27:19.900
because even if
one person is helped--

27:26.400 --> 27:27.900
Shut up, okay?

27:28.100 --> 27:29.900
Let Grace talk.

27:32.600 --> 27:33.700
Thank you.

27:36.000 --> 27:36.900
Don't touch me.

27:36.900 --> 27:39.900
- You called 911.
- No, I didn't call 911.

27:39.900 --> 27:41.800
The dog is learning
how to call 911.

27:41.800 --> 27:44.000
He isn't just learning.
He dialed 911.

27:44.100 --> 27:46.900
Over and over and over.

27:46.900 --> 27:49.300
Well, he didn't mean to.
He's a drop-out.

27:50.800 --> 27:52.700
Just go.

28:03.800 --> 28:05.000
Good night.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.200
- Good night.
- Night.

28:10.300 --> 28:12.500
There's nothing
really good about it.

28:14.300 --> 28:15.800
You're you don't want
to come inside?

28:16.500 --> 28:19.600
Uh, no. I better not.

28:20.600 --> 28:22.200
It's a nice night, though.

28:22.600 --> 28:24.000
Enjoy the fresh air.

28:25.200 --> 28:26.200
Yeah.

28:29.500 --> 28:32.800
I could just really
use somebody to talk to. ???

28:33.400 --> 28:35.900
Just to talk.

28:37.100 --> 28:39.100
???

28:39.200 --> 28:41.100
Tell me what you told Amy.

28:41.700 --> 28:43.600
Everything's going to be okay.

28:43.900 --> 28:45.600
It's just scary, you know?

28:45.800 --> 28:47.200
It's really scary,

28:47.700 --> 28:49.200
not having anybody.

28:51.400 --> 28:52.800
What about the dad?

28:53.700 --> 28:56.600
Please. You think every pregnant girl
has a Ben and a Ricky?

28:57.700 --> 29:00.700
I haven't talked to the father since
I told him he was a father.

29:02.100 --> 29:03.600
Are you going
to keep the baby?

29:03.700 --> 29:06.700
I can't keep the baby. My parents just
kicked me out of my house.

29:09.300 --> 29:13.200
I spent the last 16 year of birthday money
on my first and last month's rent,

29:13.200 --> 29:16.700
and I have no idea
what going to do.

29:18.200 --> 29:20.400
That's not me
asking for money. I--

29:22.000 --> 29:24.100
I could just really
use a friend, you know?

29:31.800 --> 29:33.600
Everytng's going to be fine.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.400
It's going to be all right.

29:39.200 --> 29:41.400
???

29:53.800 --> 29:54.800
Need something?

29:55.500 --> 29:57.600
I was just goingo get
some juice for John.

29:57.600 --> 29:58.600
Yeah.

29:59.500 --> 30:01.800
- Let's talk.
- I don't want to talk.

30:01.900 --> 30:03.100
I do.

30:03.800 --> 30:06.300
Now, I'm your dad, and would think
after all we've been through with you this year

30:06.300 --> 30:07.400
that you'd want to talk to me.

30:07.400 --> 30:09.700
but whether or not you talk to me,
I'm going  talk to you.

30:10.900 --> 30:12.900
Ames, you can't just do
whatever you want.

30:13.200 --> 30:16.400
I'm really impressed with how much
you've grown up this past year,

30:16.500 --> 30:19.300
and how well you care
for a baby at 16, but still...

30:19.900 --> 30:22.100
you're not grown up.
You're not 18.

30:22.200 --> 30:24.200
You can't do
whatever you want.

30:25.600 --> 30:28.200
You and your sister and
your mother and me, we're a family.

30:28.600 --> 30:31.700
And a family really isn't about letting
each person do whatever they want.

30:32.300 --> 30:35.000
It's about each person
doing what's good for the family.

30:35.400 --> 30:36.900
And that's how we learn
to do what's good for the world,

30:36.900 --> 30:39.400
and I know you're all into
doing what's good for the world.

30:40.100 --> 30:41.600
But guess what, sweetie?

30:41.600 --> 30:44.100
It starts by doing
what's good for the family.

30:44.600 --> 30:47.300
It wasn't good for you to run off
and be with Ben tonight.

30:48.300 --> 30:50.100
We need to be with your mother.

30:50.500 --> 30:52.600
And I would hope,
at this point,

30:53.000 --> 30:55.600
once you saw that
she was on bed rest, ???

30:55.800 --> 30:57.700
"Hey, I was supposed to go out
with Ben tonight,

30:57.800 --> 31:01.000
but I see Mom needs me.
She needs all of us. So I'll stay home."

31:01.000 --> 31:02.500
Then I would know
you were growing up,

31:02.500 --> 31:04.000
if you said something like that.

31:07.500 --> 31:10.500
Ames, when you disrespect me,
I lose respect for you.

31:10.500 --> 31:12.200
???

31:12.200 --> 31:16.000
And you're only choosing to do
something that's not right ???

31:16.200 --> 31:17.900
or just out of spite.

31:18.500 --> 31:22.900
You've done a few things out of
your own selfish inrest, or out of spite.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.500
We're talking about you.

31:31.900 --> 31:33.100
Hi.

31:33.200 --> 31:35.300
I apologize
for just dropping by.

31:35.400 --> 31:36.500
- I called.
- Yeah.

31:36.500 --> 31:38.100
I couldn't pick up my phone.

31:38.200 --> 31:39.900
Someone was talking to me.

31:40.800 --> 31:45.400
George, I stopped by your house to ask
if I could just have a minute with Amy.

31:45.700 --> 31:47.400
She's all yours.

31:49.400 --> 31:50.900
What's going on?

31:52.400 --> 31:55.500
What's going on is that
I called Heather

31:55.500 --> 31:57.400
and went out with her as a friend.

31:57.900 --> 32:00.400
Yeah, I did, Amy.

32:00.400 --> 32:04.400
But after listening to her, I realized that
I'm not really the friend that she needs.

32:04.500 --> 32:06.900
I went up against my dad
to go out with you,

32:06.900 --> 32:08.300
and then you betrayed me?

32:08.400 --> 32:12.100
You went up against your dad because you
were feeling insecure about our relationsh.

32:12.300 --> 32:15.400
And you wanted to keep me fromoing out
with another girl so much,

32:15.500 --> 32:18.900
that you risked losing
the respect of your entire family.

32:22.200 --> 32:23.300
Truth or dare?

32:23.300 --> 32:28.400
I guess you just said the truth for me,
so I'll take the dare.

32:31.200 --> 32:32.500
So in closing,

32:32.500 --> 32:37.100
I just want to say that I take full responsibity
for my decision to have sex with Jack.

32:37.500 --> 32:40.500
I seduced him.
I tempted him.

32:41.300 --> 32:44.400
I went against my own beliefs
for a few moments of passion,

32:44.400 --> 32:46.600
ill-expressed through meaningless sex.

32:48.000 --> 32:51.600
And once you go to that place, you can never,
ever go back to where you were before.

32:53.300 --> 32:56.300
And though I feel certain
that God has forgiven me and Jack,

32:57.500 --> 32:59.400
I also live with regret.

33:00.100 --> 33:01.800
???

33:02.500 --> 33:03.800
Yes, I do.

33:03.900 --> 33:05.400
No, I don't think so.

33:05.400 --> 33:06.900
I think you wish you did

33:07.300 --> 33:10.700
because if you could regret it
really regret it,

33:11.000 --> 33:12.500
then you'd feel better.

33:13.200 --> 33:16.500
??? that you regret it,

33:16.500 --> 33:18.600
then you'd actually regret it.

33:19.400 --> 33:21.600
But as i ???, you're thinking about
doing it again.

33:24.100 --> 33:28.000
I'm sorry, Grace, but despite the pain
of the past few months,

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
the emotional pain
as well as the groin injury,

33:31.200 --> 33:33.500
I'm still thking about
doing it again.

33:33.800 --> 33:36.400
And so are you.
I can tell.

33:36.600 --> 33:38.500
That's the real problem.

33:38.700 --> 33:41.700
And you didn't say anything
about that to anyone.

33:42.500 --> 33:45.600
So, you going to close
with a joke?

33:45.700 --> 33:47.900
Tom and Tammy
are waiting in the car.

33:51.300 --> 33:53.200
I'm sorry, Jesus.

33:53.700 --> 33:55.200
He might be right.

34:01.500 --> 34:03.500
I guess I was moved to speak.

34:10.800 --> 34:12.900
You were definitely right
about having sex

34:12.900 --> 34:15.300
before that lecture
and not after.

34:16.600 --> 34:18.100
Yeah.

34:18.600 --> 34:20.800
More right than I ever dreamed.

34:21.199 --> 34:22.600
How's that

34:24.300 --> 34:25.400
I don't know.

34:25.400 --> 34:28.400
She keeps getting to me.

34:28.600 --> 34:32.100
Grace. She keeps coming back
to me with this...

34:32.100 --> 34:36.000
"it's wrong to have sex"
over and over again.

34:36.100 --> 34:38.600
Once in a while,
she seems to get through,

34:39.699 --> 34:42.699
and all that talk about
why you should be married first

34:42.699 --> 34:45.500
and why sex is better
when you're married--

34:46.500 --> 34:48.900
I don't know. It's like
she snuck into my brain

34:48.900 --> 34:51.800
and planted a seed
that's starting to take over.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.900
Either what she's saying is
starting to make a lot of sense,

34:54.900 --> 34:56.300
or I'm hypnotized.

34:56.300 --> 34:58.100
Oh, come on.

34:58.200 --> 35:00.100
No, I mean it.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.300
Just tell me,

35:03.300 --> 35:06.400
you think there's any way
the two of us

35:06.400 --> 35:09.200
would ever get married sometime
in the distant future,

35:09.200 --> 35:11.200
or even near future?

35:11.700 --> 35:14.700
You ever see us getting married
and raising a family?

35:18.900 --> 35:20.500
Yeah, I didn't think so.

35:21.200 --> 35:23.200
???

35:23.200 --> 35:27.500
but I can't even hold on to the fantasy
for a few minutes in my head,

35:27.500 --> 35:30.800
so I just don't think about it.

35:30.800 --> 35:32.300
It's probably best.

35:32.500 --> 35:34.200
How is it probably best?

35:34.200 --> 35:36.800
Because, Adrian,
I care about you.

35:36.900 --> 35:39.100
But I don't see myself
as ever married to anyone.

35:39.300 --> 35:40.800
Not even Amy.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.200
Not even Amy?

35:42.200 --> 35:45.100
???

35:46.300 --> 35:51.200
So therefore, you don't ever see yourself
marrying anyone and raising a family.

35:51.400 --> 35:52.500
No.

35:55.200 --> 35:57.700
All right,as long as
you're keeping it real.

35:59.100 --> 36:03.500
???

36:06.400 --> 36:08.300
I want to see other people.

36:08.300 --> 36:10.200
You see other people.

36:10.400 --> 36:12.400
Yeah, but now I want to be
honest about it.

36:12.400 --> 36:15.500
I don't wanto hide it
because why should I?

36:15.600 --> 36:18.900
You don't want to be the guy I'm with
the rest of my life, fine.

36:19.200 --> 36:22.500
But that guy is out there,
and out of respect for myself,

36:22.600 --> 36:24.500
and no disrespect to you,

36:24.700 --> 36:26.100
I'm going to find him.

36:26.200 --> 36:29.700
You just had your dad
buy a house next to Amy ???

36:29.800 --> 36:32.700
???

36:32.800 --> 36:34.200
It was a mistake.

36:34.300 --> 36:36.000
But you're moving in.

36:49.500 --> 36:53.400
Hey. I just wanted to come by and say
I'm sorry we didn't get to go out tonight.

36:53.500 --> 36:55.100
???

36:55.400 --> 36:56.600
???

36:56.600 --> 36:59.500
??? with Griffin right now,
and I'm kind of nervous

36:59.500 --> 37:01.700
she's going to think I'm gay, so...

37:01.700 --> 37:04.800
I was hoping I could make a display
of affection towards you.

37:05.200 --> 37:07.800
I'm not going to kiss you just so
your mother won't think you're gay.

37:07.900 --> 37:10.200
???

37:10.200 --> 37:12.000
I just came from church
with an openly guy.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
How can you accuse me
of being homophobic?

37:14.400 --> 37:15.400
Wait a minute.

37:15.400 --> 37:18.800
You're not using this mother excuse
to try to get me to kiss you, are you?

37:19.300 --> 37:20.500
Would that work.

37:21.400 --> 37:22.700
No.

37:24.100 --> 37:26.300
You have a really healthy attitude.

37:26.600 --> 37:28.300
How'd you come by that?

37:29.800 --> 37:34.200
I got the crap beat out of me
57 times in elementary school

37:34.300 --> 37:37.000
for having a crush on Al Gore.

37:37.300 --> 37:39.600
It's true. I think he's really cute.

37:39.600 --> 37:43.200
I don't agree with his politics,
but ??? that smile.

37:43.800 --> 37:46.700
So my dad ???
put me in the ring.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.300
Made me take boxing.

37:48.300 --> 37:50.300
And  people he paid
beat the crap out of me,

37:50.300 --> 37:53.100
but I got a little
self-confidence out of it.

37:53.500 --> 37:56.200
You have more than a little
self-confidence.

37:56.300 --> 37:59.500
I think you've got self-esteem,
self-respect.

38:00.100 --> 38:01.600
Well, that's good.

38:04.600 --> 38:06.700
What I want is a boyfriend.

38:08.500 --> 38:09.700
No, not Mark.

38:09.700 --> 38:12.100
Mark's in love with Ashley.
And he's not gay.

38:13.300 --> 38:14.900
He's not.

38:19.100 --> 38:21.800
You're supposed to say
it's okay if he is, though.

38:21.900 --> 38:23.400
Wouldn't matter.

38:23.900 --> 38:26.000
Doesn't define what kind of person you are,

38:26.000 --> 38:29.700
your attraction to the same sex
or the opposite sex.

38:29.900 --> 38:31.500
It's just who you are.

38:32.600 --> 38:34.800
Is that what your parents
said to you?

38:36.500 --> 38:37.600
yep.

38:38.300 --> 38:41.400
And my older brother,
and my brother older than that.

38:42.500 --> 38:44.500
By the time I realized
I was gay, too,

38:44.500 --> 38:47.800
it was really okay
with the entire family.

38:50.400 --> 38:53.800
So, Mark's in love, huh?

38:58.000 --> 39:00.300
???

39:00.400 --> 39:01.800
But then they give you that shot.

39:01.800 --> 39:03.200
Does that hurt?

39:03.700 --> 39:07.200
Not that much. Besides,
you don't even care at that point.

39:08.100 --> 39:09.700
Who's going to be there with you?

39:10.500 --> 39:12.600
I didn't ask Ben,
if that's what you're getting at.

39:12.600 --> 39:15.600
No, that's not
what I was getting a...

39:16.900 --> 39:19.300
I was just going to let you know that
you can call me.

39:19.500 --> 39:21.700
My family and I will come with you,
if you want.

39:22.600 --> 39:24.700
Thanks, but-- I mean, really?

39:24.800 --> 39:26.500
If you don't have anyone.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.500
???

39:31.700 --> 39:33.200
when do they take it?

39:34.200 --> 39:36.100
When you go home
from the hospital.

39:36.500 --> 39:40.400
And if I can't find anybody
by then, what happens to her?

39:41.300 --> 39:43.900
Here in California,
you can abandon her at the hospital,

39:43.900 --> 39:45.900
so don't think about
not going to the hospital.

39:45.900 --> 39:48.200
They'll help you with it.

39:48.300 --> 39:49.700
I could help you, too.

39:49.700 --> 39:53.600
I know lots of information about
social services and private adoption.

39:54.600 --> 39:57.800
Ricky's mom will help you.
Jack's dad will help you.

39:58.300 --> 40:00.500
???

40:01.700 --> 40:05.400
I can't keep her.
I can't even provide a home for her.

40:05.400 --> 40:07.600
I can baly provide a home for myself.

40:08.800 --> 40:10.800
Your parents won't let you
come back home?

40:11.200 --> 40:14.000
No. They told me to get out
and never come back.

40:14.100 --> 40:16.000
I'm all grown up.
I'm having a baby.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
I have to do it on my own.

40:26.100 --> 40:28.300
She's driving me crazy, Amy.

40:29.500 --> 40:31.100
???

40:31.600 --> 40:33.400
The way she can drive me crazy.

40:33.500 --> 40:37.000
She just gets so wound up,
then goes off in all different directions.

40:37.300 --> 40:41.200
One minute, she's a girl.
And one minute, she's a won.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
She's totally unpredtable.

40:44.000 --> 40:47.200
And sometimes,
completely unreasonable.

40:47.800 --> 40:49.500
But she's got a heart of gold.

40:50.600 --> 40:54.500
If she just channels that all in the
right direction, she is going to be a hell of a--

40:55.700 --> 40:57.700
- Um.
- Wife?

41:01.600 --> 41:03.300
She's just like her mother.

41:03.800 --> 41:04.900
Thanks.

41:05.500 --> 41:08.300
Oh, uh, I'll say good night.

41:11.500 --> 41:12.800
Good night.

41:12.800 --> 41:14.000
???

41:21.100 --> 41:23.500
Thanks for standing by me
this past year.

41:25.100 --> 41:27.600
???

41:28.700 --> 41:30.300
My whole life.

41:35.200 --> 41:37.400
We got a lot of years ahead of us, kid.

41:42.600 --> 41:43.800
Where's Ashley?

41:43.800 --> 41:45.800
Making out with some guy
on the porch.

41:47.600 --> 41:50.200
It's going to be nice for you
to have a son, isn't it?

41:50.700 --> 41:51.900
Yup.
