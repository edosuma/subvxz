<b>1x08 - Fear Itself</b>

00:22.429 --> 00:25.225
<i>Previously on "Green Lantern"...</i>

00:25.293 --> 00:28.195
Razer, we have to get
to the interceptor.

00:28.262 --> 00:31.965
If we do not leave now,
we will all die.

00:36.672 --> 00:39.312
<i>sync, correction by f1nc0

00:45.146 --> 00:48.081
Green Lantern, Hal,
and sergeant Kilowog,

00:48.149 --> 00:50.150
these are the last
of your emergency provisions.

00:50.218 --> 00:53.687
A constant need for food seems to
be a drawback of organic life forms.

00:53.754 --> 00:58.491
Tell me about it. You don't have to
eat grilled cheese sandwich in a can.

01:00.361 --> 01:03.997
- What'd you get?
- Glazed <i>mungtor</i>.

01:04.065 --> 01:08.602
Glazed? Hey, I'll eat anything glazed.
Donuts, cookies, ham.

01:11.339 --> 01:13.039
Help yourself.

01:13.107 --> 01:16.009
Tempting, but I'll stick with this.

01:16.077 --> 01:18.712
What is cheese, exactly?

01:18.779 --> 01:22.482
It is curdled lacteal milk from
a female bovine species on Earth.

01:24.085 --> 01:27.954
From now on, how about you eat
that in a closet or something.

01:28.022 --> 01:30.924
I have identified
a nearby class G planet

01:30.992 --> 01:34.361
in our current system that might
be a source of food supplies.

01:34.428 --> 01:39.399
Nice work, Aya. A Green Lantern
can not live on <i>mungtor</i> alone.

01:46.874 --> 01:49.442
Shouldn't the kid
be helping us out on this?

01:49.510 --> 01:52.012
Evidently his race
has a snazzy food storage system

01:52.079 --> 01:53.880
that can go for months
without refilling.

01:53.948 --> 01:56.316
- Are you kiddin'?
- Nope.

01:56.384 --> 01:59.219
Besides, who wants to take
Razer on vacation?

01:59.287 --> 02:00.921
 Not me.

02:00.988 --> 02:04.157
Hey, check this out.
I had Aya rig me up an EBD.

02:04.225 --> 02:05.358
EBD?

02:05.426 --> 02:08.461
An Edible Biomass Detector.
She named it.

02:08.529 --> 02:10.463
It should make it easy to find
something to eat, though.

02:10.531 --> 02:13.700
When it comes
to food, I follow my nose.

02:15.269 --> 02:18.520
Sure, follow your nose
to the oversized cockroaches.

02:18.521 --> 02:22.742
And I'll use this time-saving gadget
to lead me to my all I can eat buffet.

02:22.810 --> 02:24.911
You do that, Jordan.

02:50.538 --> 02:52.605
Back off!

03:25.640 --> 03:29.864
Wow, this place is paradise.
Look at this view... 

03:35.749 --> 03:38.050
Ok, what was that?

03:43.123 --> 03:46.892
These things are supposed
to be foolproof.

03:54.534 --> 03:57.069
This is more like it.

03:57.137 --> 03:59.972
All I need is a fancy straw
and a little paper umbrella.

04:19.192 --> 04:23.028
What is wrong
with this place?

04:23.096 --> 04:25.431
<i>Daddy!</i>

04:25.498 --> 04:27.766
<i>Daddy!
Yeah!</i>

04:31.905 --> 04:35.741
<i>No!</i>

04:36.843 --> 04:38.611
No!

04:38.678 --> 04:42.147
Not too fast.
You fell hard.

04:42.215 --> 04:44.783
How long have I been out?

04:44.851 --> 04:49.655
A few hours. I brought you to my
village after you saved me from the Nadara.

04:49.723 --> 04:51.390
I am Galia.

04:51.458 --> 04:55.494
Name's Kilowog.
And I think you saved me.

04:55.562 --> 04:59.598
Have some soup.
My home remedy.

05:00.967 --> 05:03.435
It's... delicious!

05:03.503 --> 05:09.208
I used powdered Orem in it.
My secret ingredient. Don't tell anyone.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.848
Tastes like a dish
I used to love back home.

05:15.916 --> 05:21.420
Oh. Does your... wife cook?
For you and your family.

05:21.488 --> 05:22.988
Not anymore.

05:23.056 --> 05:27.893
I had a family once, but, uh,
they were lost long ago.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.929
I'm sorry.

05:29.996 --> 05:32.731
If you're feeling better,
you can meet my family...

05:32.799 --> 05:36.001
my tribe.
We are called the Zor.

05:42.876 --> 05:46.912
Razer, it is good to see you
venture from your quarters.

05:46.980 --> 05:50.750
- Have you recharged your ring?
- What business is that of yours?

05:50.817 --> 05:54.620
I am curious about the process and
how it differs from the Green Lantern's.

05:54.688 --> 05:57.022
Leave me alone.

06:05.799 --> 06:09.468
Stupid beeping piece of junk.

06:40.534 --> 06:44.336
And this is the village elder, Yarley.

06:44.404 --> 06:49.508
You should be called "Kilowog the brave"
from what Galia told us.

06:49.576 --> 06:52.845
Well, I think she maybe
exaggerated my abilities a little.

06:52.913 --> 06:58.717
I did not! You saved me.
And this is our lead warrior, Leph.

07:01.454 --> 07:03.389
Perhaps you are the one
who can save us all

07:03.456 --> 07:08.127
from the dreaded Nadara
with your special powers.

07:13.400 --> 07:17.570
Thanks, but, you know, I've got to
find my buddy and get back to my ship.

07:19.639 --> 07:22.241
Please, Kilowog.
We need your help.

07:22.309 --> 07:26.312
This is about survival. The
Nadara come and steal our Orem.

07:26.379 --> 07:27.746
We use it for everything...

07:27.814 --> 07:33.252
clothing, buildings, weapons, spice.
Our existence depends on it.

07:33.320 --> 07:38.090
Please, Kilowog the brave.
Don't let the monsters hurt us.

07:39.793 --> 07:43.542
Heh. I won't, little one.

07:45.891 --> 07:49.168
Tell me more about these Nadara.

07:57.544 --> 08:00.679
What are you freaks?
Get... get away from me!

08:12.735 --> 08:19.408
Wow. Please tell me this isn't a dream,
'cause it's awful dull for one of my dreams. 

08:21.144 --> 08:24.742
Hello.
Are you the chef?

08:25.293 --> 08:27.445
Measuring me for a bun
or something?

08:37.028 --> 08:39.096
Aya, it's Hal.
Do you read me?

08:39.163 --> 08:42.633
Razer? Kilowog?
Anyone?

08:42.700 --> 08:47.270
Incommunicado. Great.
Nobody's talking to me.

08:47.338 --> 08:50.173
Except you, Norm.
You look like a Norman.

08:50.241 --> 08:52.309
Can I call you Norman?

08:52.377 --> 08:54.344
Guess you'll have to be
my tour guide.

08:54.412 --> 08:58.315
First things first... any good
takeout places in this neighborhood?

09:04.055 --> 09:06.857
"With blood and rage
of crimson red,

09:06.924 --> 09:09.259
we fill men's souls
with darkest dread..."

09:09.327 --> 09:12.863
What are you doing here?!
I told you to leave me alone!

09:12.930 --> 09:16.700
I was monitoring. Your vital
signs became abnormally high.

09:16.768 --> 09:20.070
You... you don't
understand how hard this is.

09:20.138 --> 09:22.939
I've turned from Atrocitus'
cult of hate,

09:23.007 --> 09:24.975
but the ring stayed with me.

09:25.043 --> 09:27.244
Which means the rage
in my heart remains.

09:27.311 --> 09:30.547
And so I must use the Red
Lantern oath to recharge it.

09:30.615 --> 09:33.717
I have observed how the ring
affects your emotional state.

09:33.785 --> 09:35.819
What is the rest of this oath?

09:37.655 --> 09:42.959
"And twist young minds to pain
and hate, we'll burn you all...

09:43.027 --> 09:45.062
that is your fate."

09:45.129 --> 09:47.864
- Interesting.
- Interesting?

09:47.932 --> 09:51.768
It's vile. And I'm forced
to say it again and again.

09:51.836 --> 09:54.504
Razer, I did not intend...
get out!

10:03.648 --> 10:07.217
I may have Green Lantern
powers, but I can't do this alone.

10:07.285 --> 10:11.922
You must all train, and train
hard, to defend this family!

10:11.989 --> 10:15.559
Yes, sir, Kilowog
of the braves, sir!

10:17.862 --> 10:20.330
Have I not kept our people
safe all this time?

10:20.398 --> 10:24.668
Yes, Leph, you have.
But you do not have Kilowog's power.

10:24.736 --> 10:28.205
The power to destroy the Nadara
once and for all.

10:29.272 --> 10:31.908
We'll see.

10:31.976 --> 10:36.012
I should only have
to show you these skills once.

10:53.397 --> 10:59.302
Use this simple hand to hand pattern.
Engage, lock, throw!

11:11.048 --> 11:13.550
Keep together.
Watch your spacing.

11:13.618 --> 11:15.819
Always stay in the wedge
formation, always.

11:15.887 --> 11:18.588
And protect the flanks.

11:22.059 --> 11:26.830
Stop, stop! Back to
position now and try it again.

11:26.898 --> 11:29.699
- They're learning.
- Not fast enough.

11:29.767 --> 11:31.701
These are very basic skills.

11:31.769 --> 11:34.504
Argh. I don't even think
I can turn them around.

11:34.572 --> 11:37.507
No.
You're an excellent teacher.

11:37.575 --> 11:40.477
And you're my best student.

11:40.545 --> 11:44.815
But it's not enough.
So let's get it right this time!

11:50.254 --> 11:53.356
I've seen these yellow
crystals somewhere, Norm.

11:59.263 --> 12:01.264
What are you doing?
Get back!

12:05.303 --> 12:07.838
Oh. Heh.
Sorry, Norman.

12:07.905 --> 12:11.074
Just touching that stuff gave me
a serious case of the heebie-jeebies.

12:14.278 --> 12:16.646
You're miners.

12:16.714 --> 12:19.950
Now I remember,
the asteroid prison.

12:20.017 --> 12:23.353
This yellow crystal was there, too,
and messes with the power rings.

12:23.421 --> 12:26.289
But this must be
even more concentratated.

12:26.357 --> 12:29.793
The effects are much worse.

12:29.861 --> 12:32.095
And you know the crystals
are bad for me, don't you?

12:32.163 --> 12:34.998
You don't talk, but that
doesn't mean you're not smart.

12:35.066 --> 12:37.067
We have to find my friend Kilowog

12:37.134 --> 12:40.103
and see if he's figured out
what this stuff is, too.

13:00.424 --> 13:03.126
<i>No! No!</i>

13:03.194 --> 13:05.556
<i>No!</i>

13:08.010 --> 13:09.933
No, no, no!

13:10.001 --> 13:14.905
Kilowog! Are you ok?
You were dreaming.

13:14.972 --> 13:17.340
Yes.

13:20.243 --> 13:24.513
Yes.
I know what we have to do.

13:26.650 --> 13:32.121
Zor warriors, wake up!
It's time to act.

13:38.695 --> 13:40.329
We can't just wait and defend.

13:40.397 --> 13:43.232
We risk being overrun.
Do you hear me?

13:43.300 --> 13:46.001
We don't let the enemy
dictate the rules of engagement.

13:46.069 --> 13:48.203
We take the fight to them.

13:48.271 --> 13:51.774
Kilowog is right.
We must attack the Nadara.

13:51.841 --> 13:54.576
Except the Nadara
don't go out until sunrise.

13:54.644 --> 13:57.112
So we march now
and catch 'em at first light.

13:57.180 --> 14:00.249
We work 'em out
in one fell swoop!

14:03.186 --> 14:08.857
I was saving this for you,
Kilowog the brave.

14:08.925 --> 14:11.760
Thank you, Galia.

14:14.998 --> 14:18.701
I'll wear it proudly
as a member of the Zor.

14:18.768 --> 14:21.904
Now, let's hunt us down
some Nadara!

14:30.747 --> 14:32.181
Are you sure this is the way?

14:32.248 --> 14:35.250
I haven't seen you ask for
directions from anyone, Norm.

14:43.827 --> 14:47.162
There they are. I should
have never doubted you, Norm.

14:47.230 --> 14:50.833
Hey, Kilowog!
Over here!

14:50.900 --> 14:54.803
My friend is a traitor!
He's one of them now!

14:54.871 --> 14:58.374
Zor warriors, kill 'em all!

15:01.931 --> 15:03.590
Zor, attack! 

15:11.075 --> 15:14.077
Hey, hey, whoa, wait!
What's going on?

15:33.297 --> 15:35.331
Kilowog!
It's me! Hal!

15:35.399 --> 15:37.200
Traitor!

15:37.268 --> 15:40.236
Listen! These yellow crystals
are making you cra...

15:43.841 --> 15:46.643
Kilowog, you've got
to listen to me.

15:46.710 --> 15:49.445
No.
I've got to kill you!

16:01.959 --> 16:06.195
Hey!
Put me down!

16:16.907 --> 16:20.109
You can't stand against
Kilowog the brave!

16:22.251 --> 16:24.981
Kilowog, you've got to hear me.
The crystals make you paranoid.

16:25.049 --> 16:28.184
It's like the prison asteroid,
only the effects are much stronger.

16:28.252 --> 16:30.787
You're a liar,
and I don't believe you!

16:30.854 --> 16:35.024
Fine, let's do it the hard way.
I didn't forget your training.

16:35.092 --> 16:37.794
Engage, lock, throw!

16:46.468 --> 16:48.037
My powers have returned.

16:48.105 --> 16:50.473
Because you're away
from the yellow crystals.

16:50.541 --> 16:53.710
They affect our powers
and our minds.

17:37.087 --> 17:40.223
Kilowog, I know
the real you is in there.

17:40.290 --> 17:43.159
Think, buddy.
Think about what you're doing.

17:52.069 --> 17:56.339
Kilowog, it's me.
It's Hal.

18:02.311 --> 18:04.781
You talk too much.

18:20.731 --> 18:23.800
I knew it!
You're a traitor, Kilowog.

18:26.603 --> 18:30.273
Zor warriors, keep at them.
Don't listen to Leph!

18:30.340 --> 18:34.243
Galia's with them, too!
She's trying to protect him.

18:34.311 --> 18:35.912
We must kill them both!

18:39.183 --> 18:44.487
It's the Orem! These yellow
crystals are destroying our minds!

18:47.324 --> 18:48.991
The Nadara are not your enemy.

18:49.059 --> 18:52.195
They're miners. They dig up
the Orem and feed off it.

18:52.262 --> 18:55.731
It's harmless for them,
but they know it's bad for us.

18:55.799 --> 18:57.633
They've been trying
to keep it away from you.

18:57.701 --> 19:00.203
They... don't want to hurt us?

19:00.270 --> 19:02.205
- No.
- You figured all this out?

19:02.272 --> 19:03.773
By yourself?

19:03.841 --> 19:06.676
Well, my buddy Norm
here helped.

19:14.750 --> 19:17.019
The Nadara
are very efficient creatures.

19:17.087 --> 19:20.823
Yeah. They don't talk much,
but they do work hard.

19:22.659 --> 19:25.928
You can cook many things
with these sugar vines.

19:27.064 --> 19:28.598
It figures that on this planet,

19:28.665 --> 19:32.034
everything that looks like it
will hurt is actually delicious.

19:32.102 --> 19:37.940
- I made this to remember you.
- I'll always remember you, Tila.

19:38.008 --> 19:43.346
- I will miss you, Kilowog the brave.
- As will I.

19:46.135 --> 19:48.117
I'm trusting you to keep
your people safe.

19:48.185 --> 19:52.288
They're our people.
You are one of us, Kilowog.

19:54.524 --> 19:57.193
Will you come back
to check on our progress?

19:57.261 --> 20:01.097
No.
But I'll come to see you.

20:23.046 --> 20:25.021
Have you finished
your recharging ritual?

20:25.088 --> 20:26.789
No.

20:26.857 --> 20:29.926
I have something that might
help. I ran a detailed analysis

20:29.993 --> 20:31.794
of the rhythm and meter
of your Red Lantern oath.

20:31.862 --> 20:35.898
And I've created an alternative
that should also be effective.

20:41.038 --> 20:43.706
"The power of the crimson red"

20:43.774 --> 20:46.275
"can lead your soul away from dread"

20:46.343 --> 20:49.278
"and heal the deepest wounds of hate."

20:49.346 --> 20:52.682
"Let no one else decide your fate."

20:52.749 --> 20:57.119
I detect no change in your
metabolic rate. Have you recharged?

20:57.187 --> 21:00.056
Yes.
Thank you, Aya.

Your concern is... appreciated.

21:10.061 --> 21:11.934
I wish it were that easy.

21:12.002 --> 21:14.854
"With blood and rage of crimson red,

21:14.855 --> 21:17.707
we fill men's souls with darkest dread

21:17.774 --> 21:21.010
and twist your minds to pain and hate.

21:21.011 --> 21:24.246
We'll burn you all, that is your fate!"
