00:00.848 --> 00:04.582
Hot in Cleveland was recorded
in front of a live studio audience!

00:05.838 --> 00:07.108
Elka!

00:08.090 --> 00:09.321
Elka!

00:09.463 --> 00:11.384
- Let us in!
- Please, elka,

00:11.510 --> 00:14.611
the tornado is coming!
***

00:14.807 --> 00:17.895
- Maybe she's not down there.
- Oh, she's down there.

00:18.035 --> 00:21.868
It wreaks of pot and I can even ***.

00:23.891 --> 00:25.172
Elkaa!

00:26.192 --> 00:27.874
Victoria!

00:29.241 --> 00:30.997
Why aren't you at the airport?

00:31.039 --> 00:34.135
*** all over the place.

00:34.636 --> 00:36.068
Now why aren't you down there yet?

00:36.229 --> 00:37.716
Elka is not letting us in!

00:37.868 --> 00:39.365
Well she has to!

00:39.515 --> 00:40.869
It's ***.

00:40.918 --> 00:42.993
- What?
- This must be her grow house.

00:43.223 --> 00:46.936
Elka, we don't care about
your stash, just let us in!

00:46.981 --> 00:48.638
Okay!

00:50.675 --> 00:53.485
But you better be cool!

Repeating our top story,

01:20.061 --> 01:21.092
the national weather service

01:21.126 --> 01:22.625
is putting the greater
Cleveland area

01:22.659 --> 01:24.090
under a tornado watch.

01:24.124 --> 01:25.790
Stay tuned for the latest
updates and in...

01:26.823 --> 01:27.855
What are you doing?

01:27.890 --> 01:28.854
Well, I'm calling Paris.

01:28.889 --> 01:30.720
My dress for the daytime Emmys

01:30.754 --> 01:31.853
still hasn't arrived.

01:31.888 --> 01:33.019
But that was lifesaving
information.

01:33.054 --> 01:35.318
Yeah, so is this.

01:35.352 --> 01:38.250
<i>Oui, hello?
C'est moi encore.</i>

01:38.284 --> 01:41.281
<i>Chercher ma robe maintenant,
ou des tetes tomberont!</i>

01:41.316 --> 01:43.980
Bloody French.

01:44.014 --> 01:45.513
You don't even know
who she's talking to.

01:45.547 --> 01:47.911
Don't need to.

01:47.946 --> 01:49.644
What's happening?

01:49.679 --> 01:51.577
- If my one-of-a-kind
couture gown

01:51.611 --> 01:53.275
doesn't arrive within the hour,

01:53.310 --> 01:56.274
then my private jet'll never
make it to L.A. by showtime.

01:56.309 --> 01:57.973
Who'd you have to sleep with
to get a private jet

01:58.007 --> 02:00.705
out of of Cleveland?

02:00.739 --> 02:02.871
I resent that comment.

02:02.905 --> 02:05.936
And it's not who think.

02:05.970 --> 02:07.734
Even if your dress does arrive,

02:07.769 --> 02:09.967
you're never gonna be able
to fly in this weather.

02:10.001 --> 02:11.500
Ah, weather be damned.

02:11.534 --> 02:13.898
<i>'Cause now that edge of tomorrow
is been canceled,</i>

02:13.933 --> 02:16.797
this'll be my very last chance
to show that Susan Lucci

02:16.831 --> 02:20.461
who the real queen
of daytime is.

02:20.496 --> 02:24.825
Judge Judy?

02:24.860 --> 02:28.058
You know, darling...

02:28.092 --> 02:29.557
Instead of making fun,

02:29.591 --> 02:30.590
perhaps you should go and find

02:30.624 --> 02:33.122
the bottom half of your skirt.

02:33.156 --> 02:35.420
- I have a date.
- Oh!

02:35.454 --> 02:36.886
Oh, why pretend?

02:36.921 --> 02:39.919
It's a booty call.

02:39.953 --> 02:40.951
Booty call.

02:40.985 --> 02:42.183
Do people still say that?

02:42.218 --> 02:45.216
People do,
but I'm not sure joy should.

02:45.250 --> 02:47.614
Remember that hot guy
at the coffee shop?

02:47.649 --> 02:49.847
- Oh, yeah, the one
with no long-term potential.

02:49.848 --> 02:51.546
Well, I've decided
all I need him for

02:51.580 --> 02:52.546
is the short term.

02:52.579 --> 02:53.944
I don't mean to be crude,

02:53.978 --> 02:58.342
but I really need
a good rogering.

02:58.377 --> 03:01.008
In this weather?

03:01.042 --> 03:02.973
"In this weather"?

03:03.008 --> 03:04.539
Oh, would you relax?

03:04.573 --> 03:06.671
Elka says tornadoes
never hit Cleveland.

03:06.705 --> 03:11.003
She also said
Lebron wouldn't leave.

03:11.037 --> 03:13.401
Look...
I'm the only one here

03:13.435 --> 03:14.800
who hasn't gotten lucky.

03:14.835 --> 03:16.533
I've dated the guy
I thought was my son

03:16.567 --> 03:18.199
and the guy I thought
was a murderer.

03:18.233 --> 03:21.830
But for whatever reasons,
those did not work out.

03:21.864 --> 03:23.795
So what do you know
about this guy?

03:23.830 --> 03:25.828
Nothing!
And that's the beauty of it.

03:25.862 --> 03:27.528
I only need to know
what he's going to do

03:27.561 --> 03:29.193
between 12:00 and 1:00.

03:29.227 --> 03:31.392
Or 12:00 to 12:18.

03:33.092 --> 03:34.423
I've clocked it.

03:36.557 --> 03:38.022
Well, just keep your phone on,

03:38.056 --> 03:39.454
because if this tornado
gets any worse,

03:39.488 --> 03:40.487
I want to be able
to get a hold of you.

03:40.522 --> 03:42.319
Fine.

03:42.354 --> 03:44.751
Oh, my God, look at that wind!

03:44.785 --> 03:46.551
Her clothes are gonna
fly right off!

03:46.585 --> 03:47.850
That's the plan!

03:50.682 --> 03:52.981
What is all this stuff?

03:53.015 --> 03:57.145
<i>I feel like
I'm in the goonies.</i>

03:57.180 --> 03:58.512
Wow.

03:58.546 --> 03:59.878
Is this stuff real?

03:59.912 --> 04:02.276
Is that a tiara?

04:02.310 --> 04:03.742
Who are you?

04:06.875 --> 04:08.606
I'm Anastasia,

04:08.640 --> 04:12.238
the last surviving member
of the romanov dynasty.

04:15.570 --> 04:16.802
You are?

04:16.836 --> 04:20.067
No, but I've always
wanted to say that.

04:22.200 --> 04:23.831
Is all of this yours?

04:23.866 --> 04:25.763
No, it's stolen.

04:25.798 --> 04:28.029
Oh, my God.

04:28.064 --> 04:31.927
And now I'm going
to have to kill you!

04:31.962 --> 04:35.125
I've always wanted
to say that too.

04:38.382 --> 04:39.384
So you're a jewel thief?

04:39.419 --> 04:40.521
How could that be?

04:40.555 --> 04:45.402
It takes you 20 minutes
to walk to our mailbox.

04:45.437 --> 04:48.310
It's not mine.
It's my husband's.

04:48.344 --> 04:50.216
But I thought you told us
your husband was an accountant?

04:50.250 --> 04:51.486
He was.

04:51.520 --> 04:53.258
But...After he died,

04:53.293 --> 04:58.908
I discovered he was also
a fence for the mob.

04:58.943 --> 05:01.449
Wow, and you never knew?

05:01.484 --> 05:03.922
Well, he never let me in here.

05:03.958 --> 05:07.968
I thought he was hiding
girly magazines.

05:08.002 --> 05:10.977
Oh, I was so relieved.

05:11.011 --> 05:12.214
Well, why didn't you ever

05:12.249 --> 05:13.785
turn all this stuff
into the cops?

05:13.820 --> 05:16.560
And ruin my husband's
good name?

05:16.594 --> 05:18.599
You know, holding on
to all of this stuff

05:18.634 --> 05:19.970
makes you an accessory.

05:20.005 --> 05:21.775
I mean, you could go to jail.

05:21.809 --> 05:24.918
Well, there's that too.

05:24.952 --> 05:27.325
So are we the only people
who have seen this?

05:27.359 --> 05:29.966
Well, there was one time...

05:30.000 --> 05:32.105
What you have here,
Mrs. Smith,

05:32.140 --> 05:35.482
is a genuine Faberge egg.

05:35.517 --> 05:37.421
Oh, what?

05:39.026 --> 05:42.034
I couldn't resist.
I love that show.

05:44.041 --> 05:45.645
This stuff is so shiny.

05:45.679 --> 05:46.681
Isn't it?

05:46.716 --> 05:49.390
I use a mixture
of herbs and such

05:49.424 --> 05:53.502
<i>for a special
polish polish.</i>

05:53.536 --> 05:55.040
Oh, my God.

05:55.074 --> 05:57.848
This is what smells like pot.

05:57.882 --> 06:00.422
This is why you always
smell like pot.

06:00.456 --> 06:02.027
Why didn't you tell me?

06:02.061 --> 06:04.869
It was fun messing with you.

06:09.750 --> 06:10.986
Ohh!

06:11.020 --> 06:12.090
Oh, my God,
we're all gonna die.

06:12.124 --> 06:13.795
Melanie, Melanie, it's okay.

06:13.829 --> 06:15.566
Victoria,

06:15.600 --> 06:19.545
do you have a pill that can
help with this situation?

06:19.579 --> 06:20.882
To share?

06:23.023 --> 06:25.996
I have some potato whisky
right here.

06:26.032 --> 06:27.936
Grab some Roman goblets.

06:31.012 --> 06:33.452
Here, make mine a double.

06:33.487 --> 06:37.999
Ohh, I cannot believe
that I'm trapped down here.

06:38.033 --> 06:39.369
When a beloved artist

06:39.404 --> 06:42.378
inhabits an unforgettable role
like honor St. raven

06:42.413 --> 06:44.551
for the past 27 years,

06:44.586 --> 06:47.125
and cannot get to the daytime
emmy awards

06:47.161 --> 06:50.904
to receive her public lauding
from her peers

06:50.938 --> 06:54.448
after being overlooked
for such a long time...

06:54.482 --> 06:57.088
Well, then
the terrorists have won.

06:59.964 --> 07:02.604
Listen, even
if you can't be there

07:02.638 --> 07:04.443
to get the award,
you could still win.

07:04.478 --> 07:05.814
Oh, but what's the point,

07:05.849 --> 07:08.990
if I can't personally
rub it in Lucci's face?

07:09.024 --> 07:10.828
I'm sorry,
forget about the emmy.

07:10.863 --> 07:11.898
Let's put the tiara on.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.469
Oh, where'd it go?

07:19.255 --> 07:20.323
I needed cheering up.

07:20.358 --> 07:22.763
Something kind of big
happened today.

07:22.798 --> 07:23.834
What?

07:23.868 --> 07:26.240
She had sex with a stranger.

07:26.275 --> 07:28.714
How much did you pay him?

07:33.329 --> 07:34.999
I'd be happy
to insult you back,

07:35.034 --> 07:36.404
but I'm still kind of on edge.

07:36.438 --> 07:38.677
Sounds like
you didn't pay him enough.

07:46.167 --> 07:48.472
Joy, what happened?

07:48.506 --> 07:50.311
It started off great.

07:50.346 --> 07:51.983
I was feeling so liberated.

07:52.017 --> 07:54.022
Since I knew there was no future
in the relationship,

07:54.056 --> 07:56.596
I didn't care about
the things I normally would.

07:56.631 --> 08:01.343
Would you like a back massage
or...Whatnot?

08:01.378 --> 08:03.349
I just want to do it.

08:03.384 --> 08:05.322
And, time permitting,
do it again.

08:05.356 --> 08:06.458
Awesome.

08:06.493 --> 08:07.863
Maybe we could hook up
with some funyuns

08:07.897 --> 08:09.199
in between rounds.

08:11.240 --> 08:13.813
And none of this
was turning you on?

08:13.847 --> 08:15.051
No.

08:15.085 --> 08:16.387
I wouldn't say it was
turning me on more,

08:16.422 --> 08:18.360
but it wasn't turning me off.

08:18.394 --> 08:20.399
I was just looking out
for my own pleasure.

08:20.434 --> 08:22.305
I like funyuns.

08:32.736 --> 08:35.076
It's probably
just my friend Melanie.

08:35.111 --> 08:37.381
She available for round two?

08:37.417 --> 08:38.687
That's just...

08:38.721 --> 08:39.923
Oh, who cares?

08:44.303 --> 08:47.479
I'm sorry, she's kind of
freaked out about the weather.

08:47.514 --> 08:50.688
I think weather's cool.

08:50.723 --> 08:52.527
Maybe don't talk.

08:55.002 --> 08:57.040
Oh, God.

08:57.074 --> 08:59.514
The message isn't
from my friend.

08:59.549 --> 09:01.520
It's from my son.

09:03.725 --> 09:05.028
- Oh, my God.
- I know!

09:05.063 --> 09:07.402
Is that the son
you put up for adoption?

09:07.438 --> 09:09.243
I don't have any others.

09:09.277 --> 09:11.650
You never know with you.

09:18.274 --> 09:20.112
The website I used to find him

09:20.146 --> 09:21.282
gave him my information.

09:21.317 --> 09:22.754
And he was looking for you too?

09:22.788 --> 09:24.091
That's amazing.

09:24.126 --> 09:26.265
Well, the nooner
thought differently.

09:26.300 --> 09:28.707
Did you even know
the nooner's name?

09:28.741 --> 09:32.117
Not well enough
to use confidently.

09:34.125 --> 09:36.499
Uh, can't you
talk to him later?

09:36.534 --> 09:39.810
No, you don't understand,
da... fra...

09:39.844 --> 09:40.847
Dude.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.963
This is a big deal.

09:45.998 --> 09:47.435
See, I gave him up
for adoption,

09:47.470 --> 09:50.445
and this is the first time
I've heard from him, ever.

09:50.480 --> 09:51.850
What should I say?

09:51.884 --> 09:54.325
When my mom has guys over,

09:54.359 --> 09:55.863
she says she's taking a nap.

09:58.539 --> 10:00.110
Just kind of
emotional right now.

10:00.145 --> 10:01.716
Oh, great.

10:04.158 --> 10:06.130
See, a million years ago,

10:06.165 --> 10:08.003
my boyfriend and I
were in a little hotel room,

10:08.037 --> 10:09.441
just like this one.

10:09.476 --> 10:11.414
We used a condom
and everything,

10:11.449 --> 10:12.719
but fertile Myrtle over here

10:12.753 --> 10:14.591
gets pregnant
the first time out.

10:14.625 --> 10:16.163
All the women in my family

10:16.198 --> 10:18.404
get pregnant
at the drop of a hat.

10:20.144 --> 10:21.915
Wait...Where are you going?

10:21.950 --> 10:24.557
Listen...I love sex,

10:24.592 --> 10:26.698
but, truth is...

10:26.732 --> 10:31.615
My mom's place doesn't
have any room for kids, so...

10:31.649 --> 10:32.952
Oh, go ahead.

10:32.987 --> 10:34.892
I don't need sex with you.

10:34.926 --> 10:36.397
I have my son.

10:41.113 --> 10:42.919
<i>You said that?</i>

10:42.953 --> 10:44.791
Oh, you know what I meant.

10:44.826 --> 10:46.597
Well, what did you end up
writing back to your son?

10:46.631 --> 10:47.835
Nothing.

10:47.869 --> 10:49.640
The storm knocked out
all of the reception.

10:49.675 --> 10:52.015
Now I'm dying to tell him
how much I want to meet him,

10:52.050 --> 10:54.189
and he's someplace thinking
I don't care.

10:54.224 --> 10:56.229
Oh, he's not thinking that.

10:56.263 --> 10:58.034
Oh, guh!

10:58.070 --> 10:59.707
That sounds horrible.

10:59.741 --> 11:01.246
And Pete's out there.

11:01.280 --> 11:03.051
They called up all
the first responders.

11:03.086 --> 11:05.593
Ugh, I could never
be a first responder.

11:05.628 --> 11:08.402
Maybe a fifth responder,
you know.

11:08.436 --> 11:11.412
It's all cleaned up,
and the press can get in.

11:15.126 --> 11:16.529
I just hope he's okay.

11:16.564 --> 11:18.402
Oh, I'm sure he's fine.

11:18.437 --> 11:20.777
He's probably someplace safe,
wondering if you're okay.

11:20.811 --> 11:22.248
Well, actually, I'm not sure

11:22.282 --> 11:24.121
he's really thinking
about me right now.

11:24.156 --> 11:26.830
'Cause I said something
I shouldn't have.

11:26.864 --> 11:29.137
Earlier today,
I was calling my kids

11:29.172 --> 11:30.141
to calmly assure them

11:30.176 --> 11:31.646
that I was fine.

11:31.680 --> 11:33.418
This may be the last time
I ever speak to you.

11:33.453 --> 11:34.489
I just want you to know
that I love you.

11:34.523 --> 11:36.528
I love you so much.

11:36.563 --> 11:37.866
Please don't worry,

11:37.900 --> 11:39.505
but...

11:39.539 --> 11:41.980
Please save this message...

11:42.015 --> 11:44.187
For the grandkids.

11:45.225 --> 11:47.064
Aah! Aah!

11:47.098 --> 11:48.200
Oh! Pete!

11:48.235 --> 11:49.806
Oh, my God!
You're alive!

11:49.840 --> 11:52.180
I'm so happy!

11:52.214 --> 11:53.217
Am I getting a little insight

11:53.252 --> 11:54.287
into how you handle a crisis?

11:54.322 --> 11:56.093
Oh, my God, this is a crisis?

11:56.127 --> 11:58.702
Look, baby, I'm pretty sure
the safety's on,

11:58.736 --> 11:59.939
but you're straddling my gun.

11:59.973 --> 12:01.210
Oh, sorry.

12:01.244 --> 12:03.217
Be truthful.
How bad is it out there?

12:03.251 --> 12:04.421
No, there's no need to panic.

12:04.456 --> 12:05.524
Did you get your emergency
supplies together,

12:05.559 --> 12:06.829
like I told you?

12:06.863 --> 12:08.534
Yes, I packed my shoes
and my makeup,

12:08.569 --> 12:12.179
and my clothing iron
runs on batteries.

12:12.214 --> 12:14.253
What? Those are emergency
supplies in L.A.

12:14.287 --> 12:16.260
I'm still learning here.

12:16.294 --> 12:19.370
You know, you are...

12:19.405 --> 12:21.812
Too cute.

12:25.223 --> 12:26.661
Ahem.

12:26.695 --> 12:28.500
Well?

12:28.535 --> 12:31.075
Oh, my God, you look gorgeous!

12:31.110 --> 12:32.246
Ohh.

12:32.281 --> 12:33.818
Um, this is your idea
of an emergency outfit?

12:33.852 --> 12:36.995
I really don't think you women
are thinking this through.

12:37.030 --> 12:38.768
No, she's dressed
for the daytime Emmy awards.

12:38.802 --> 12:40.975
You know, with any luck,
if I leave now,

12:41.009 --> 12:42.647
I'll miss the tribute
to barker's beauties,

12:42.682 --> 12:45.824
but make it in time
for everything else.

12:45.859 --> 12:48.366
Would you please tell her
that she is crazy

12:48.400 --> 12:50.239
to get on a plane
in this weather?

12:50.273 --> 12:52.346
Well, she can get on it,
but it's not going anywhere.

12:52.380 --> 12:54.854
Oh. Oh, Pete.

12:54.889 --> 12:59.937
Dear, sweet,
small-town Pete.

12:59.972 --> 13:02.780
How can I put this
in a way that won't offend you?

13:02.814 --> 13:05.121
Oh, I'm dying to find out.

13:05.156 --> 13:07.228
Well, here's how it works
with celebrities.

13:07.262 --> 13:10.171
No matter what the weather,
our private planes take off.

13:10.205 --> 13:12.445
And no matter how many
infractions against the law

13:12.479 --> 13:14.285
we allegedly commit,

13:14.320 --> 13:18.365
our autographs make it
all go away.

13:18.399 --> 13:19.401
Do you understand?

13:19.436 --> 13:20.773
Yeah, I think so, uh...

13:20.808 --> 13:21.843
Well, you better get out there.

13:21.877 --> 13:23.482
Oh, good man.

13:23.516 --> 13:28.666
You know, I think there might
be an autograph in your future.

13:28.700 --> 13:29.836
Wish me luck.

13:33.215 --> 13:34.451
Okay, Victoria...

13:34.486 --> 13:35.957
We can do this.

13:35.991 --> 13:38.966
I played a lady storm chaser
in the lifetime movie,

13:39.001 --> 13:41.006
<i>lady storm chasers.</i>

13:41.041 --> 13:45.722
I've been through
much worse than this.

13:45.756 --> 13:47.193
Don't worry.
She's not going anywhere.

13:47.228 --> 13:48.532
Okay.

13:48.566 --> 13:50.939
Attention,
all personnel report immediately

13:50.973 --> 13:53.314
to the emergency
operations center.

13:53.348 --> 13:56.190
The tornado watch has been
upgraded to a warning.

13:56.224 --> 13:57.394
Oh! A warning!

13:57.428 --> 13:58.798
- A funnel cloud has been...
- Funnel?

13:58.833 --> 14:00.939
Spotted five miles east
of the Metro area.

14:00.973 --> 14:05.621
The funnel! That's what
makes the cows fly!

14:05.655 --> 14:08.263
Uh, you know, that happens
a lot less often

14:08.297 --> 14:10.838
than that movie suggests.

14:10.873 --> 14:12.376
Everything
will probably be fine,

14:12.411 --> 14:13.815
but just promise me you'll go
down to the storm cellar,

14:13.849 --> 14:14.851
just in case.

14:14.886 --> 14:16.222
Okay, I will.
I will, I will, I will.

14:16.257 --> 14:18.163
I'll come back to check on you
just as soon as I can.

14:18.197 --> 14:19.868
Okay.

14:19.903 --> 14:22.342
Just be careful out there.
Please be careful.

14:24.250 --> 14:25.219
I love you!

14:25.253 --> 14:26.991
Oh!

14:29.601 --> 14:31.339
"I love you"?

14:31.373 --> 14:33.413
You've only known him
for a few weeks.

14:33.447 --> 14:35.319
I know, it's way too soon.

14:35.353 --> 14:37.426
It moves things to the next
level way too quickly.

14:37.460 --> 14:38.730
If one of us doesn't die,

14:38.764 --> 14:40.536
it's gonna be
really embarrassing.

14:46.490 --> 14:47.760
Do you love him?

14:47.794 --> 14:49.499
I don't know.

14:49.533 --> 14:50.937
It was just so emotional.

14:50.971 --> 14:52.241
I had just talked to my kids.

14:52.276 --> 14:53.613
I was worried about Victoria.

14:53.648 --> 14:55.787
I was telling everybody
I love 'em.

14:55.821 --> 14:57.826
All you said to me is,
"I'll miss you."

15:00.269 --> 15:02.709
Well, my love for you
goes without saying.

15:02.744 --> 15:05.419
Apparently.

15:05.453 --> 15:07.023
Did he say it back?

15:07.059 --> 15:08.362
You know, I couldn't tell.

15:08.396 --> 15:10.836
The wind was so loud
I couldn't hear anything.

15:10.870 --> 15:12.342
I don't even know
if he heard me.

15:12.376 --> 15:14.549
Oh, I wouldn't worry
about it too much.

15:14.583 --> 15:17.492
I've blurted it out
when I didn't mean it too.

15:17.526 --> 15:19.598
Someone recently mistook me
for Kate Beckinsale,

15:19.633 --> 15:21.873
and I told him I loved him.

15:21.907 --> 15:23.511
Couldn't you
have just given him

15:23.546 --> 15:26.454
a biscuit for his guide dog?

15:37.324 --> 15:40.735
Dating at our age
is a very delicate dance.

15:40.769 --> 15:42.942
You can't just go
rushing into things

15:42.976 --> 15:44.748
and throwing
"I love yous" around.

15:44.782 --> 15:46.520
I mean, he might not
be ready yet.

15:46.556 --> 15:48.494
I might not be ready yet.

15:48.528 --> 15:50.734
I just got divorced.
I moved to a new city.

15:50.769 --> 15:52.240
I'm enjoying being single.

15:52.274 --> 15:53.310
Oh, for heaven's sakes.

15:53.344 --> 15:54.949
Do you want him
to say it back or not?

15:54.983 --> 15:57.757
Of course I do.
I'm crazy about him.

15:57.792 --> 15:59.330
Ohh!

15:59.364 --> 16:00.333
But not with this storm

16:00.367 --> 16:02.005
and all of us dying and all!

16:02.039 --> 16:04.045
Oh, will you stop it?

16:04.080 --> 16:05.684
Now, remember what Elka said.

16:05.719 --> 16:08.226
Cleveland never gets hit
by tornadoes.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.577
Well, nice knowing you.

16:20.637 --> 16:23.176
Aah!

16:23.210 --> 16:24.379
What if this really is it?

16:24.413 --> 16:25.849
We could be right in
the tornado's path

16:25.884 --> 16:26.852
and not even know it.

16:26.886 --> 16:28.289
I'll never meet my son!

16:28.323 --> 16:29.927
And I'll never know
if I won that Emmy.

16:29.961 --> 16:32.668
And I'll never know if Pete
was gonna say "I love you" back.

16:32.702 --> 16:34.338
Okay, we need to get this
out of our heads,

16:34.372 --> 16:36.511
so let's just pretend
that the TV works.

16:36.545 --> 16:37.747
Okay.

16:37.782 --> 16:39.351
It's Emmy arrivals
at the red carpet.

16:39.385 --> 16:40.588
Okay.

16:40.622 --> 16:41.892
All right, now...

16:41.926 --> 16:45.935
Who do we think
looks like crap?

16:45.970 --> 16:47.907
I'll go first.

16:47.941 --> 16:48.910
Lucci.

16:48.944 --> 16:51.617
Oh, you are such a good friend.

16:51.651 --> 16:53.589
And a liar.

16:53.624 --> 16:58.301
Lucci rocks the red carpet.

16:58.335 --> 17:00.106
You know, honesty is overrated.

17:00.140 --> 17:01.877
I mean, what group of women

17:01.912 --> 17:03.582
could stay best friends
for 20 years

17:03.616 --> 17:05.319
without bending the truth
a little.

17:05.354 --> 17:07.224
- 20 years?
- Yeah.

17:07.259 --> 17:09.564
We've been through
everything together.

17:09.598 --> 17:12.405
Let's see, between us,
six divorces...

17:12.439 --> 17:15.146
Five of them yours.

17:15.180 --> 17:17.986
And an endless array
of bad boyfriends.

17:18.020 --> 17:19.624
All of them mine.

17:19.657 --> 17:20.659
Five kids.

17:20.694 --> 17:21.662
Two grandkids.

17:21.696 --> 17:23.300
Nieces, please.

17:26.343 --> 17:28.614
We've just always
had each other's backs.

17:28.648 --> 17:30.218
For better and for worse.

17:32.291 --> 17:34.630
I wish I had
what you three have.

17:34.664 --> 17:37.371
Well, you do...Now.

17:40.345 --> 17:42.918
I meant a tolerance
for your voices.

17:42.953 --> 17:45.592
But yes.

17:45.626 --> 17:46.595
Yay!

17:46.629 --> 17:48.098
Wait, do you hear that?

17:48.133 --> 17:49.268
It's quiet outside.

17:49.302 --> 17:50.738
Maybe the storm's passed.

17:50.773 --> 17:52.978
Or maybe we're
in the eye of the storm.

17:53.012 --> 17:54.415
Victoria, find the news.

17:54.449 --> 17:57.056
What, are you kidding?
No, the daytime Emmys are on.

17:57.090 --> 17:59.094
I made a miracle comeback
from a fake illness

17:59.128 --> 18:00.631
to win this thing.

18:00.665 --> 18:03.037
If they call my name,
I want to hear it.

18:03.072 --> 18:05.343
And Crystal McAllister

18:05.378 --> 18:06.814
<i>for the strong and the gorgeous.</i>

18:06.848 --> 18:08.118
Oh, my God,
this is my category.

18:08.152 --> 18:11.760
Everybody just shut up.

18:11.794 --> 18:14.100
And the Emmy
for outstanding actress

18:14.134 --> 18:16.139
in a daytime drama goes to...

18:16.173 --> 18:18.511
<i>Victoria chase
for edge of tomorrow.</i>

18:18.545 --> 18:20.784
Oh, my God!

18:20.818 --> 18:21.820
You won!

18:21.855 --> 18:23.825
Can you believe it?

18:23.860 --> 18:26.098
Victoria chase could not
be with us.

18:26.133 --> 18:30.142
Accepting for her tonight,
Ms. Susan Lucci.

18:35.524 --> 18:39.867
You have got to be kidding me.

18:39.902 --> 18:43.176
And in my
one-of-a-kind dress.

18:43.211 --> 18:46.585
Victoria chase is now
living in Cleveland

18:46.619 --> 18:51.231
and recovering from some
disfiguring disease.

18:51.265 --> 18:53.670
The words "botched"
and "surgery"

18:53.705 --> 18:55.041
have been tossed around,

18:55.075 --> 18:57.714
but who can say?

18:57.748 --> 19:01.022
Although she cannot be here
with us today,

19:01.057 --> 19:04.030
I know she must be
feeling what I feel.

19:04.065 --> 19:05.234
Gratitude...

19:05.268 --> 19:07.707
For all my loyal fans!

19:07.741 --> 19:11.851
You have loved me
for so many years.

19:11.886 --> 19:13.389
Oh, and you don't
have to worry,

19:13.423 --> 19:16.229
because, unlike
honor St. raven,

19:16.264 --> 19:18.869
Erika Kane will be around
to entertain you

19:18.904 --> 19:24.117
for many, many years to come.

19:24.151 --> 19:26.890
Get your grubby little
doll hands off my award,

19:26.925 --> 19:29.096
you beautiful freak!

19:29.131 --> 19:31.904
Aah!

19:32.941 --> 19:34.444
Melanie, are you there?

19:34.478 --> 19:36.917
Oh, Pete!
Yes, we're down here!

19:36.952 --> 19:38.321
What's it like out there?

19:38.355 --> 19:39.791
It's okay.
It's over.

19:39.825 --> 19:42.465
They're working on the power,
but the storm's passed.

19:42.499 --> 19:43.935
Everybody all right in here?

19:43.970 --> 19:45.473
Oh, I'm so glad you're okay.

19:45.507 --> 19:47.378
- Uhh.
- Oh, listen...

19:47.412 --> 19:49.249
I've been thinking
about this all day.

19:49.284 --> 19:50.519
When we said good-bye...

19:50.554 --> 19:52.859
Yeah, I was thinking
about it too,

19:52.893 --> 19:54.129
and, uh...

20:13.580 --> 20:15.418
What the hell
is all this stuff?

20:15.452 --> 20:17.089
Wait, what...
You were gonna say something.

20:17.123 --> 20:20.030
You had to date a cop,
didn't you?
