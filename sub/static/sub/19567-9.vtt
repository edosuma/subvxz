WEBVTT

00:00.047 --> 00:02.045
Previously on "The Arrangement":

00:02.071 --> 00:03.546
I made you, and I love you,

00:03.570 --> 00:05.204
but I will end you in a heartbeat.

00:05.229 --> 00:08.096
How hard did you fight for me?

00:08.124 --> 00:10.069
How hard did you try to make
a different deal with her?

00:10.093 --> 00:12.193
My job is a lot easier
when he has a clear head,

00:12.262 --> 00:14.729
and this lover's quarrel
that's between the two of you

00:14.797 --> 00:16.030
does not help me right now.

00:16.055 --> 00:18.900
Amelia Briggs has replaced
Megan in "The Kill Plan."

00:18.968 --> 00:22.603
- "Technicolor Highway."
- This script is so us.

00:22.672 --> 00:25.206
There was a time when
you and I came first.

00:25.275 --> 00:27.141
No matter what we did,
or who we did it with,

00:27.210 --> 00:29.110
we made sure that we were okay.

00:29.178 --> 00:30.611
When did that change?

00:30.680 --> 00:32.079
I'm a journalist.

00:32.148 --> 00:34.015
I'm doing an undercover
piece on the Institute.

00:34.083 --> 00:35.850
It's about my stepbrother.

00:35.919 --> 00:37.952
He used to come in my bedroom at night.

00:38.021 --> 00:41.455
How is this possible? You
have a security system.

00:41.524 --> 00:43.557
Maybe they're looking to make a point.

00:43.626 --> 00:45.226
The point being what?

00:45.295 --> 00:47.061
That they can come in anytime they want.

00:54.304 --> 00:57.238
When we talk about the stories
of our lives here at IHM,

00:57.307 --> 00:59.473
we're always talking about rewriting.

00:59.542 --> 01:02.143
But what if we didn't have to unlearn?

01:02.211 --> 01:03.945
What if our stories of fulfillment

01:04.013 --> 01:07.214
started at the very
beginning when we were kids?

01:07.283 --> 01:11.085
Now, for all of us,
that's just a hypothetical,

01:11.154 --> 01:15.022
but for the next generation,
that is a real possibility.

01:15.091 --> 01:17.825
Because with the right
tools, we can foster new lives

01:17.894 --> 01:20.394
that are virtually
free of non-productives.

01:20.463 --> 01:22.430
I'm talking about the kind
of tools that will come

01:22.498 --> 01:26.834
as naturally to your
kids as reading, writing,

01:26.903 --> 01:29.003
taking selfies.

01:29.072 --> 01:31.138
And that's why I'm
thrilled to introduce to you

01:31.207 --> 01:33.641
to IHM's new developmental program

01:33.710 --> 01:36.077
which we call the First Life Initiative.

01:36.145 --> 01:38.346
And I'm proud to present to you

01:38.414 --> 01:41.782
the new state-of-the-art
facility that will be its home.

01:41.851 --> 01:44.993
Together, we can make sure our
children's experience of the world

01:45.018 --> 01:46.945
is unfiltered and authentic.

01:46.990 --> 01:49.757
Imagine an education where
children grow up curious

01:49.826 --> 01:53.160
and uninhibited by traditional
rote educational techniques

01:53.229 --> 01:56.397
where they are free to
question and explore.

01:56.466 --> 01:58.833
Who wouldn't want to
live in a world like that?

01:58.901 --> 02:01.602
Now, obviously, none of this
is possible without the help

02:01.671 --> 02:04.238
of IHM's most important members,

02:04.307 --> 02:06.841
and that's why I'm
asking you all to join me

02:06.909 --> 02:09.477
to help make this a reality.

02:15.985 --> 02:18.052
Hey, how was your weekend?

02:18.121 --> 02:21.088
Pretty good. You do anything fun?

02:21.157 --> 02:23.257
Nah, just laid low.

02:23.326 --> 02:24.992
Nice.

02:27.230 --> 02:29.830
Guys, can I, can I
get a quick level from you?

02:29.899 --> 02:31.665
There's no dialogue.

02:31.734 --> 02:35.668
I believe the script
calls for some, um, noises.

02:35.693 --> 02:37.638
Copy that.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:51.868 --> 02:53.187
How's that?

02:53.256 --> 02:54.755
Yeah, that'll work.

03:03.889 --> 03:07.034
- No foam, skinny latte?
- Yeah, thanks.

03:07.103 --> 03:09.136
It's you, Megan Morrison.

03:09.205 --> 03:11.405
Wow.

03:12.428 --> 03:14.975
Hey, you holding up okay?

03:15.044 --> 03:16.577
What?

03:16.602 --> 03:19.303
You haven't seen, um...

03:35.064 --> 03:36.630
Shit.

03:36.699 --> 03:38.466
That doesn't bother you, does it?

03:38.534 --> 03:39.700
I thought it was funny.

03:39.769 --> 03:42.600
I mean, the picture is so
obviously a production still,

03:42.625 --> 03:44.887
which I tried to explain
to the guy at the register,

03:44.912 --> 03:47.616
but I think he just felt sorry for me.

03:48.478 --> 03:49.910
You might want to be worried about

03:49.979 --> 03:52.379
who leaked the photo, though.

03:52.448 --> 03:54.648
My publicists leaked the photo.

03:54.717 --> 03:56.161
I'm just surprised they did it so early.

03:56.185 --> 03:57.985
Publicists? So you knew about this?

03:58.054 --> 04:00.554
Sort of, it's kind of complicated.

04:00.623 --> 04:02.644
- Kyle!
- I should've told you.

04:03.559 --> 04:05.426
We're okay, right?

04:05.495 --> 04:07.728
What? My God. Yes, we're okay.

04:07.797 --> 04:09.708
Of course we are, I mean,
you think we're okay, right?

04:09.732 --> 04:13.567
I thought so, but you're
freaking me out a little bit.

04:13.636 --> 04:16.670
I'm sorry! We are great.

04:16.738 --> 04:18.805
Look, let's take a drive.

04:18.875 --> 04:21.082
I need to show you something.

04:21.440 --> 04:24.245
It's really great to
see you again, Kyle.

04:24.313 --> 04:26.073
Are Terence and DeAnn
going to be joining us?

04:26.097 --> 04:27.381
No. No, not today.

04:27.450 --> 04:29.617
I just wanna get Megan up
to speed on the PR plan.

04:29.685 --> 04:30.824
Sure thing.

04:30.849 --> 04:33.154
- We're all fans, by the way.
- Thank you.

04:33.222 --> 04:35.856
Now, I know we jumped the
gun a little on the rollout,

04:35.925 --> 04:39.822
but there are a ton
of fall releases, so...

04:39.847 --> 04:42.062
we thought it would be a
good idea to get a head start

04:42.131 --> 04:44.532
on the campaign.

04:44.600 --> 04:48.068
What exactly are these? Potential ideas?

04:48.137 --> 04:50.037
No. It's one entire story.

04:50.106 --> 04:51.705
It goes from left to right.

04:51.774 --> 04:53.707
Because the love story
in "The Kill Plan"

04:53.776 --> 04:55.160
is so compelling,

04:55.215 --> 04:57.878
we're using a romantic
triangle to build intent to see.

04:57.947 --> 05:00.414
It's all timed to build maximum interest

05:00.483 --> 05:02.650
in Kyle and Amelia for
the release this fall.

05:02.718 --> 05:05.753
If SM does well, it can really
give the per-screen numbers

05:05.821 --> 05:07.555
a nice bump on opening weekend.

05:09.158 --> 05:11.113
Stands for Stealth Marketing.

05:13.963 --> 05:16.931
So... our relationship falling apart,

05:16.999 --> 05:19.033
this is all to promote the movie?

05:19.101 --> 05:21.635
Yes, but we do get you back together

05:21.704 --> 05:23.971
in time for the premiere.
We're thinking...

05:24.040 --> 05:26.040
things eventually get a little crazy,

05:26.108 --> 05:28.976
you guys will decide to take
a weekend away to reconnect...

05:29.045 --> 05:30.992
in Paris.

05:31.618 --> 05:34.602
The focus groups always love Paris.

05:35.718 --> 05:39.457
So you knew about this? The whole thing?

05:39.989 --> 05:42.389
Just the general shape of it.

05:42.458 --> 05:44.358
It's all a part of a bigger discussion

05:44.427 --> 05:46.293
about the PR campaign for the movie.

05:46.362 --> 05:49.396
Posters, TV ads, talk shows.

05:49.465 --> 05:52.144
Honestly, I try to
stay out of the details.

05:52.735 --> 05:55.598
But the details are what they're
telling the public about us.

05:55.623 --> 05:57.855
That doesn't matter to you?

05:57.880 --> 05:59.772
Well, I don't want to
come off as a bad person.

05:59.842 --> 06:01.242
I make that very clear,

06:01.310 --> 06:03.344
but I let them do their
thing, and I do mine.

06:03.412 --> 06:06.113
I don't see how you
could separate the two.

06:06.182 --> 06:09.083
Easy. One's fake. The other one's real.

06:09.151 --> 06:10.751
It's not that simple.

06:10.820 --> 06:12.553
They're our names and our images,

06:12.622 --> 06:14.188
so it's not entirely fake,

06:14.257 --> 06:16.056
and your publicists
are writing the script,

06:16.125 --> 06:17.992
which essentially means that you are.

06:18.060 --> 06:20.294
- Megan...
- Kyle, they work for you.

06:20.363 --> 06:22.896
And what if something
actually real happens?

06:22.965 --> 06:25.048
Does that just get ignored?

06:25.073 --> 06:26.877
Well, I guess that depends.

06:26.902 --> 06:28.330
On what?

06:28.355 --> 06:31.205
On whether or not it
fits into the narrative.

06:31.274 --> 06:33.526
Wow, okay.

06:35.011 --> 06:38.479
Megan, I... I should've
given you more of a heads-up.

06:38.547 --> 06:41.315
I'm sorry, but we're talking
about a marketing plan,

06:41.384 --> 06:43.250
not our lives.

06:43.319 --> 06:45.712
Our lives are controlled by a contract

06:45.737 --> 06:47.988
that we signed with each
other, remember that?

06:48.057 --> 06:49.923
There are stages in that, too.

06:49.992 --> 06:53.627
- That's completely different.
- Maybe.

06:54.127 --> 06:56.964
Look, don't get me
wrong... I love our life.

06:57.033 --> 06:59.099
It's just...

06:59.168 --> 07:02.502
sometimes it feels like
someone else is planning it.

07:26.529 --> 07:28.228
You were looking for me?

07:28.297 --> 07:30.898
Yeah, I was just going over
the First Life donations.

07:30.966 --> 07:32.717
- And?
- Disappointing.

07:32.742 --> 07:34.313
I thought we'd do
better. Well, you know,

07:34.337 --> 07:36.192
these things don't happen overnight.

07:36.217 --> 07:37.945
I'm sure the money will come.

07:39.041 --> 07:42.211
Not if you keep hijacking the financing.

07:43.546 --> 07:45.546
I just spoke to Mitch Kirkland.

07:45.614 --> 07:47.614
He said he's investing in your movie.

07:47.683 --> 07:49.217
When did that happen?

07:49.242 --> 07:51.038
Okay, yes,

07:51.063 --> 07:53.626
we spoke after your
presentation the other day,

07:53.651 --> 07:54.897
but he came to me.

07:54.922 --> 07:56.695
What was I supposed to
do, talk him out of it?

07:56.719 --> 07:58.525
Get him on board with this project.

07:58.594 --> 08:00.039
Come on, Terence.

08:00.064 --> 08:02.074
Mitch doesn't give a shit
about progressive education.

08:02.098 --> 08:03.675
He only comes here to placate
his little trophy wife.

08:03.699 --> 08:05.399
And here, I was so moved

08:05.468 --> 08:08.769
by your impassioned plea
for us to be a team again.

08:09.341 --> 08:11.405
Let's get real.

08:11.826 --> 08:14.254
If you and Kyle were on speaking terms,

08:14.279 --> 08:15.513
he would be helping you with this,

08:15.537 --> 08:17.122
and you would be
raising a lot more money.

08:17.146 --> 08:18.340
I'm well aware of that.

08:18.365 --> 08:19.758
That doesn't explain
why you're not helping.

08:19.782 --> 08:21.081
I am helping.

08:21.150 --> 08:22.883
Kyle loved the script that I gave him,

08:22.952 --> 08:24.918
and that puts us back on solid ground.

08:24.987 --> 08:26.396
And right now,

08:26.421 --> 08:29.155
that's the only thing keeping him close.

08:40.955 --> 08:42.836
My God. I honestly don't think

08:42.861 --> 08:45.105
I have a single tear left in me.

08:45.157 --> 08:48.230
We shot that confession scene all day,

08:48.255 --> 08:49.888
over and over.

08:49.957 --> 08:51.290
You look nice.

08:51.358 --> 08:52.813
I thought we'd go to dinner.

08:52.838 --> 08:54.393
Our table's waiting for us at Nobu.

08:54.462 --> 08:57.162
Can't we just order in
instead? I'm exhausted.

08:57.231 --> 08:58.432
I get it.

08:58.457 --> 09:01.066
A little sake, black cod,
sunset over the beach...

09:01.127 --> 09:03.327
- it's hard work.
- Kyle...

09:03.404 --> 09:04.964
Trust me.

09:04.989 --> 09:07.151
This'll get you turned right around.

09:31.761 --> 09:33.688
Why are we stopping?

09:36.270 --> 09:38.270
- Shit.
- What?

09:38.339 --> 09:39.438
Agh!

09:39.507 --> 09:41.266
There's a shimmy in the front fork.

09:41.291 --> 09:42.757
What does that mean?

09:42.782 --> 09:45.094
Well, it means I either dropped a bolt,

09:45.110 --> 09:46.977
or the axle's broke.

09:47.045 --> 09:49.964
Either way, it's not safe to ride.

09:49.989 --> 09:51.355
Are you kidding?

09:51.380 --> 09:53.647
Believe me, I wish I was.

09:57.255 --> 09:58.788
Hey, what are you doing?

09:58.857 --> 10:00.090
Calling an Uber.

10:00.158 --> 10:02.292
No, no, don't... don't do that.

10:02.361 --> 10:04.828
- Who're you texting?
- Zach.

10:04.887 --> 10:06.426
He's gotta have somebody come out here

10:06.451 --> 10:07.698
and pick up this bike
before we can leave.

10:07.722 --> 10:09.466
That could take an hour.

10:09.491 --> 10:12.222
Are we just going to stand
on the side of the road?

10:12.537 --> 10:14.792
Yeah, no, I guess not.

10:14.941 --> 10:17.650
Look, why don't we take
a walk on the beach?

10:17.675 --> 10:19.609
I mean, we could still catch the sunset.

10:19.678 --> 10:21.698
Either that, or we just wait here.

10:59.976 --> 11:01.842
What is that?

11:01.911 --> 11:03.511
That's...

11:03.580 --> 11:05.813
a change of plans.

11:05.882 --> 11:08.156
- Come on.
- Kyle...

11:08.734 --> 11:10.384
You like it?

11:10.453 --> 11:12.253
It's beautiful.

11:12.322 --> 11:15.756
And you totally had me fooled
with the whole motorcycle thing.

11:15.825 --> 11:17.425
But you don't like it?

11:17.493 --> 11:18.693
No, I-I... I love it.

11:18.761 --> 11:20.595
It... it's just...

11:20.663 --> 11:23.831
I don't need some sort of, you
know, grand romantic gesture

11:23.900 --> 11:25.867
whenever I have a
problem with something,

11:25.892 --> 11:28.092
and I probably don't
even need you to fix it.

11:28.117 --> 11:30.237
I just need to know that you hear me.

11:30.262 --> 11:32.953
So as apologies go, this is too much?

11:34.677 --> 11:36.277
Do you hate me?

11:36.346 --> 11:37.645
No.

11:37.714 --> 11:39.380
I love you.

11:39.449 --> 11:42.049
And this isn't an apology.

11:43.319 --> 11:44.920
I know it's a lot,

11:44.945 --> 11:47.021
and not everything has
to be a grand production,

11:47.090 --> 11:48.756
but it has to be done right,

11:48.825 --> 11:51.219
and I don't know any
other way to do this.

11:52.095 --> 11:55.352
Do what? What... what
are you talking about?

11:57.195 --> 11:58.592
This.

11:58.617 --> 12:01.163
Now, there's...

12:01.188 --> 12:03.725
Now, I think there's
a date in the contract

12:03.750 --> 12:06.219
when this is actually
supposed to happen...

12:06.709 --> 12:08.309
Kyle...

12:11.119 --> 12:14.181
I've waited my entire life...

12:14.250 --> 12:16.258
to love someone the way I love you.

12:17.950 --> 12:22.367
Every day, you continue
to inspire me and humble me

12:22.392 --> 12:25.326
and leave me breathless.

12:28.023 --> 12:30.389
So when I stand here and tell you

12:30.414 --> 12:32.739
that I want to spend the
rest of my life with you,

12:32.764 --> 12:35.297
I need you to know that this is real.

12:36.639 --> 12:39.340
I should not be standing.

12:42.311 --> 12:44.211
I want us to be a family, Megan.

12:44.280 --> 12:46.070
Will you marry me?

12:47.583 --> 12:48.816
- Yes.
- Yeah?

12:48.885 --> 12:49.909
Yes.

12:51.231 --> 12:53.221
Okay. Here you go.

12:53.956 --> 12:55.723
All right.

12:55.792 --> 12:58.659
- I love you, Kyle.
- I love you, too.

13:06.347 --> 13:09.782
- And, KyMelia?
- Goodbye. We hardly knew you.

13:09.807 --> 13:13.119
I just want to say I love you both,

13:13.188 --> 13:15.288
and I'm very happy that you're happy...

13:15.356 --> 13:16.756
But?

13:16.825 --> 13:19.092
Amelia looks like a loser now.

13:19.160 --> 13:22.195
These rumors were supposed
to go on for months.

13:22.263 --> 13:24.664
She was counting on getting
a major bump from this,

13:24.732 --> 13:26.599
so now her people are furious.

13:26.668 --> 13:28.935
Sorry.

13:29.003 --> 13:32.349
No, you're not. Which is fine...

13:32.393 --> 13:35.160
but now I have fires,
major fires, to put out.

13:35.229 --> 13:38.564
Not only with Amelia's reps,
but with the studio people,

13:38.632 --> 13:40.498
instead of doing what I should be doing,

13:40.567 --> 13:43.134
which is raising more money for
the movie you want to direct.

13:45.040 --> 13:47.872
You should've told me first.

13:51.811 --> 13:55.196
And that's Adam Westfeldt.
Thank you very much.

13:56.750 --> 14:00.144
Hello, Adam. How are you?

14:01.021 --> 14:03.121
Okay, take a breath.

14:03.189 --> 14:05.623
Just count to ten.

14:05.692 --> 14:07.725
You feel bad about this?

14:07.794 --> 14:10.495
No. No, no, I feel great.

14:10.563 --> 14:13.103
It's just... just weird.

14:13.218 --> 14:15.018
What is?

14:17.599 --> 14:20.138
It's weird that I
haven't talked to Terence.

14:20.206 --> 14:21.783
He's usually the first person I call

14:21.808 --> 14:23.908
when something big happens.

14:23.977 --> 14:26.401
Maybe you should call him, then.

14:26.601 --> 14:30.748
No, I think it's just about
what's familiar, you know?

14:30.817 --> 14:33.184
It doesn't mean I should.

14:33.253 --> 14:34.986
You have me.

14:35.055 --> 14:36.854
Forever.

14:39.025 --> 14:41.859
And then, I had to absorb
Adam Westfeldt's tantrum.

14:41.928 --> 14:43.428
Two hours of him telling me

14:43.496 --> 14:45.697
that he wasn't going to
let Kyle out of his deal.

14:45.765 --> 14:47.665
Again.

14:47.734 --> 14:50.401
- How did he seem?
- Like an eight-year-old.

14:50.470 --> 14:52.522
No, I meant Kyle. Did he seem happy?

14:52.547 --> 14:54.006
Sure.

14:54.031 --> 14:57.018
I mean, he certainly didn't care
about the shitstorm he created.

14:57.043 --> 14:58.710
Well, that's not necessarily happiness.

14:58.778 --> 15:00.678
Did he give you any
details about the proposal?

15:00.747 --> 15:03.047
- Was it strictly impulse, or...
- You miss him.

15:03.116 --> 15:04.549
That's not what this is.

15:04.617 --> 15:07.988
I'm just trying to figure out if
he gave this any serious thought.

15:08.734 --> 15:11.022
Well, I didn't probe,

15:11.091 --> 15:14.854
but I'm sure you could call
him and ask him yourself.

15:15.862 --> 15:17.345
No.

15:19.699 --> 15:21.177
We should take them
out to dinner, actually.

15:21.201 --> 15:22.503
Somewhere nice.

15:22.528 --> 15:23.935
- The four of us?
- Yeah.

15:24.004 --> 15:25.837
Just got engaged. It's
a major life event.

15:25.905 --> 15:28.439
He's been a fundamental
part of the Institute.

15:28.508 --> 15:29.907
I think it will look strange

15:29.976 --> 15:31.709
if we didn't share this with him.

15:31.778 --> 15:33.511
So, when you say "nice,"

15:33.580 --> 15:36.447
do you mean somewhere
where we can be seen?

15:36.516 --> 15:38.282
It wouldn't hurt.

15:38.351 --> 15:41.064
But he's not gonna accept
an invitation from me.

15:46.059 --> 15:47.784
Zev, you shouldn't be here.

15:47.809 --> 15:49.827
Yeah, well, I am here.

15:50.391 --> 15:52.658
Your plan wasn't foolproof.

15:53.967 --> 15:55.933
And cut!

15:56.002 --> 15:58.314
Fantastic, Kyle. Let's do one more.

15:58.339 --> 15:59.893
This time in Swedish.

16:01.394 --> 16:03.941
That's a wrap on "The
Kill Plan", everybody!

16:05.845 --> 16:07.898
Thank you for an incredible shoot!

16:07.923 --> 16:09.356
Yeah!

16:10.917 --> 16:12.250
So, you feel good?

16:12.275 --> 16:14.017
- I do.
- You should.

16:14.042 --> 16:16.254
With all this, it just makes
me hungry to do our movie.

16:16.322 --> 16:18.618
- Me too.
- Sorry to break this up,

16:18.643 --> 16:20.518
but can I have a quick word with you?

16:21.428 --> 16:22.994
It's very nice of her to come,

16:23.063 --> 16:25.897
considering that this was
supposed to be her movie.

16:25.965 --> 16:28.132
Yup, she's amazing.

16:28.201 --> 16:29.746
What's up?

16:29.771 --> 16:31.769
Well, Terence would like

16:31.838 --> 16:34.839
the four of us to have dinner
to celebrate your engagement.

16:34.908 --> 16:36.841
He sent you to ask me?

16:36.910 --> 16:38.954
Well, you and I actually have
a functioning relationship.

16:38.978 --> 16:41.012
Yeah, well, we almost didn't.

16:41.081 --> 16:43.047
Yeah, well...

16:43.116 --> 16:46.151
we can thank "Technicolor
Highway" for saving us all.

16:46.863 --> 16:48.898
Look, I don't know what
happened between you and Terence

16:48.922 --> 16:51.622
because neither of you will
talk to me about it, but I...

16:51.691 --> 16:53.758
I'm not going to have
dinner with Terence.

16:55.361 --> 16:57.927
Okay, I promised I would
ask, and now I have.

16:57.952 --> 16:59.764
He didn't even like Megan.

16:59.833 --> 17:02.278
He is just afraid this train is going
to leave the station without him.

17:02.302 --> 17:04.435
So I'll take that as a no?

17:04.503 --> 17:06.069
Yeah. No.

17:06.138 --> 17:08.156
I've got everything
in my life that I need.

17:08.182 --> 17:10.069
Everything?

17:10.510 --> 17:13.077
That's a lot of pressure
to put on one relationship.

17:13.146 --> 17:15.046
Let me know when it
airs, and congratulations.

17:15.115 --> 17:17.147
Thank you.

17:17.217 --> 17:19.117
I should say the same.

17:19.185 --> 17:20.952
Hey, Amelia. Thank you.

17:21.020 --> 17:23.054
And congratulations to
you too on all of this.

17:23.123 --> 17:24.722
Well, thanks.

17:24.790 --> 17:26.190
That's quite a ring.

17:27.760 --> 17:29.994
So what are you promoting?

17:30.063 --> 17:32.630
Well, what do you mean?

17:32.699 --> 17:34.866
You must have something
coming up, right?

17:34.934 --> 17:37.401
Otherwise, why would
Kyle do this right now?

17:37.470 --> 17:41.572
Well, I'd say he did it
because he wants to marry me,

17:41.641 --> 17:43.825
but you'd have to ask him.

17:43.850 --> 17:46.477
Okay. Well, no offense.

17:46.546 --> 17:50.135
I didn't realize you guys
actually had something "real."

17:50.160 --> 17:51.617
But all good.

17:51.684 --> 17:53.616
Are you really being
snarky with me right now

17:53.641 --> 17:55.419
because your marketing plan fell apart?

17:59.744 --> 18:01.971
You know what, forget it. I
shouldn't have said anything.

18:01.995 --> 18:04.727
Wait, no, no, no. Amelia,
wait a second, wait.

18:05.064 --> 18:06.984
Were you hoping that
the fake relationship

18:07.009 --> 18:08.766
would turn into something real?

18:08.835 --> 18:10.568
Why wouldn't I?

18:10.637 --> 18:11.947
I mean, we're in Hollywood, aren't we?

18:11.971 --> 18:14.005
Everything's a little bit fake here.

18:14.073 --> 18:16.541
No, not everything.

18:16.609 --> 18:19.544
You keep telling yourself that.

18:25.444 --> 18:27.008
I wanted to say thank you,

18:27.033 --> 18:28.566
and return this.

18:28.635 --> 18:30.468
Why would you do something like that?

18:30.990 --> 18:33.735
I really believe in the First
Life Initiative, Terence.

18:33.760 --> 18:36.357
It's... fantastic.

18:36.382 --> 18:38.015
But...

18:38.083 --> 18:41.118
this is too much money
for the work I did.

18:41.187 --> 18:44.922
I actually didn't expect
to get paid at all.

18:44.990 --> 18:46.868
Let me ask you a question.

18:46.893 --> 18:49.238
Whose metric do you use
to determine your value?

18:49.263 --> 18:50.561
Because it isn't mine.

18:50.629 --> 18:52.696
Even if I was doing it pro bono,

18:52.765 --> 18:54.965
it would still be billable hours,

18:55.034 --> 18:58.202
and, I mean, partners in my
firm don't even make this much.

18:58.270 --> 19:00.237
Well, that's too bad for them.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.710
I put a great deal of value
in what you did for me.

19:02.735 --> 19:04.374
The check is an expression of that.

19:04.443 --> 19:08.569
Well, it just feels a little excessive.

19:11.383 --> 19:14.051
Okay. If I'm really being honest,

19:14.119 --> 19:16.854
it was also a bit of an incentive.

19:16.922 --> 19:18.956
For what exactly?

19:19.024 --> 19:21.892
I need a permanent in-house counsel...

19:21.961 --> 19:23.527
someone whose abilities will be worth

19:23.596 --> 19:25.462
the very generous salary I'm gonna pay.

19:26.832 --> 19:29.788
So this is about my abilities?

19:29.812 --> 19:31.972
What else would it be about?

19:32.905 --> 19:34.638
This big check,

19:34.707 --> 19:37.274
this big job offer...

19:37.343 --> 19:39.743
I can't help but wonder if
any of it would be on the table

19:39.812 --> 19:43.125
if I wasn't... close with Megan.

19:44.316 --> 19:46.120
That's old thinking for you.

19:46.145 --> 19:48.085
I'm talking about timing.

19:48.153 --> 19:50.120
I know you've had a
falling out with Kyle.

19:50.189 --> 19:53.123
Maybe you're looking
for a connection point.

19:53.192 --> 19:56.259
You see yourself as a connection
point to Megan and Kyle?

19:56.284 --> 19:58.529
- That's not what I said.
- 'Cause I don't.

19:58.554 --> 20:01.154
I think you're smart, and
I think you're talented.

20:01.223 --> 20:02.900
And I think this is the
kind of fulfilling work

20:02.924 --> 20:04.691
that's been missing in your life.

20:04.716 --> 20:08.018
Do you or do you not...

20:08.229 --> 20:10.797
want to be at the
center of your own story?

20:13.936 --> 20:16.060
Wait, what?

20:16.085 --> 20:18.305
It's a little wrap gift to myself.

20:18.373 --> 20:19.973
I had no idea you even played.

20:20.042 --> 20:22.709
Yeah, there was a time in my 20s
when that's pretty much all I did.

20:22.778 --> 20:25.312
I learn something
new about you every day.

20:25.380 --> 20:27.614
I'll play you a little
something after dinner.

20:27.683 --> 20:29.979
Zach, is Jeff outside with the Suburban?

20:30.004 --> 20:33.486
Yeah, the car's outside, and, um...

20:33.511 --> 20:36.279
apparently, Amelia Briggs
checked into Cedars today.

20:36.304 --> 20:38.491
What happened?

20:38.560 --> 20:40.260
Her reps are saying it's exhaustion.

20:40.329 --> 20:42.529
Isn't that usually
code for something worse?

20:42.598 --> 20:44.641
Nervous breakdown, overdose...

20:44.666 --> 20:46.867
Or she's fine and she's just
trying to reclaim the narrative.

20:46.891 --> 20:48.869
Well, but that's pretty cynical.

20:48.937 --> 20:50.403
It happens all the time.

20:50.472 --> 20:52.150
Okay, what if this time
it's something serious?

20:52.174 --> 20:53.760
Do we really want to go out to dinner?

20:53.785 --> 20:56.035
- It wouldn't look very good.
- Megan, remember we promised

20:56.059 --> 20:57.701
we weren't gonna let
people plan our lives.

20:57.725 --> 20:59.512
Let's go eat.

21:01.111 --> 21:03.650
So I pitched Gunther
"Technicolor Highway."

21:03.719 --> 21:05.358
Which he loved.

21:05.383 --> 21:08.722
And he started tell me about
these lenses from the '70s

21:08.790 --> 21:10.784
that he retrofitted for today's cameras.

21:10.809 --> 21:13.460
Ask me why that's really cool.

21:13.528 --> 21:16.496
Hey, I'm talking about our
movie here. Am I boring you?

21:16.565 --> 21:19.482
No, I'm sorry, I'm just...

21:19.507 --> 21:22.602
thinking about Amelia,
and it bums me out.

21:22.671 --> 21:25.637
Because you think there's
actually something wrong?

21:25.662 --> 21:28.608
Because I don't want to
just assume that there isn't.

21:28.677 --> 21:30.510
And I get it's totally
possible that her reps

21:30.579 --> 21:32.946
- cooked something up, but...
- Probable, actually.

21:33.015 --> 21:35.601
Just being realistic.

21:35.626 --> 21:39.119
Well, we had a moment, her
and I, the other night, and...

21:39.187 --> 21:41.730
she's more upset about
everything than you think.

21:43.659 --> 21:46.526
Maybe you're forgetting the
effect you have on people.

21:48.664 --> 21:50.597
I just don't want us to be that couple

21:50.666 --> 21:53.526
that's completely
jaded about everything.

21:54.415 --> 21:56.776
All right, I'll tell you what.

21:57.525 --> 21:59.158
How about...

21:59.183 --> 22:01.074
I make a call to see how she's doing.

22:02.141 --> 22:04.110
I think that's a great idea.

22:04.179 --> 22:07.298
Okay. I'll be right back.

22:20.414 --> 22:22.180
DeAnn, hey.

22:22.205 --> 22:24.599
No, I'm just out to dinner with Megan.

22:24.624 --> 22:27.020
Look, I got a question for you.

22:27.045 --> 22:30.441
Do you know the
real story on Amelia?

22:30.519 --> 22:33.349
You know, this whole,
hospital thing.

22:35.196 --> 22:37.230
Wait, what?

22:43.391 --> 22:46.145
- Hey, Megan.
- Excuse me?

22:46.170 --> 22:48.444
Long time.

22:49.205 --> 22:51.405
Life's been treating you well.

22:51.430 --> 22:53.342
I read about you and your
big movie star boyfriend

22:53.366 --> 22:56.210
while I was still inside.
That was a surprise.

22:56.278 --> 22:58.259
You have the wrong
person. I don't know you.

22:58.284 --> 22:59.783
No, no, no, no, no, no.

22:59.852 --> 23:01.483
I was in prison for six
years because of you.

23:01.507 --> 23:02.964
We're not... we're not gonna do that.

23:02.988 --> 23:05.089
- I gotta...
- No, get down.

23:05.819 --> 23:07.953
I've been in your house.

23:07.978 --> 23:09.611
That was you?

23:09.636 --> 23:10.861
I was angry.

23:10.930 --> 23:13.298
I wanted blood, to be honest.

23:13.323 --> 23:15.499
And then I saw the place, and I realized

23:15.568 --> 23:17.334
there are better ways to get payback.

23:17.403 --> 23:19.369
W...

23:19.438 --> 23:21.004
What do you want from me?

23:21.073 --> 23:24.312
You know, when the cops first
told me that I killed Evan,

23:24.337 --> 23:25.970
I believed them.

23:25.995 --> 23:28.296
Shit, I was wasted.

23:28.321 --> 23:30.172
Passed out...

23:30.197 --> 23:32.483
What do I know? But
then little by little,

23:32.551 --> 23:34.318
things started to become clear.

23:34.386 --> 23:37.588
I kept hearing fighting in
my head, and a girl yelling,

23:37.656 --> 23:39.677
and then I remembered...

23:39.702 --> 23:41.691
you were there with him.

23:43.012 --> 23:45.545
I didn't kill Evan. You did.

23:45.570 --> 23:48.132
- That's not true.
- Bullshit!

23:48.667 --> 23:50.968
But all that matters
is when I go public,

23:51.036 --> 23:52.767
people are going to start to wonder:

23:52.880 --> 23:54.112
Did Kyle West's fiancÃ©

23:54.181 --> 23:56.415
really smash her stepbrother's head in?

23:59.905 --> 24:02.255
$5 million in this account
in the next 24 hours,

24:02.350 --> 24:04.523
or I start talking to everybody.

24:08.131 --> 24:10.224
It was nice to see you again.

24:10.249 --> 24:12.090
It's been too long.

24:32.255 --> 24:35.156
So apparently, Amelia takes
medication for migraines,

24:35.224 --> 24:37.591
and there was a mix-up
in the pill bottles,

24:37.661 --> 24:39.428
and she combined it with booze.

24:39.496 --> 24:42.625
No bueno, but she's stable now

24:42.650 --> 24:44.503
so we can go see her if you want.

24:44.528 --> 24:47.524
Actually, I'm really not feeling well.

24:47.549 --> 24:49.651
I should be the one
that feels bad, not you.

24:49.712 --> 24:51.278
No, no, it's not that.

24:51.346 --> 24:55.744
I think it was the food.
I just... wanna go home.

24:56.418 --> 24:58.218
You okay?

25:00.289 --> 25:02.237
Okay.

25:08.027 --> 25:11.109
All right, you get into bed
and I'll make you some tea.

25:11.134 --> 25:13.535
I'm gonna wash up first.

25:13.560 --> 25:15.460
Okay.

25:35.099 --> 25:37.591
Come on, come on.

25:44.512 --> 25:45.967
Green tea fine?

25:45.992 --> 25:48.902
Yeah, yeah, anything's fine.

25:51.473 --> 25:54.570
God damn it, answer!

25:58.419 --> 26:01.487
If you need anything during
the night, I'm right here.

26:09.792 --> 26:11.825
You maybe wanna turn that off?

26:11.894 --> 26:14.674
It's Shaun. Boyfriend emergency.

26:15.924 --> 26:18.665
Just tell her you're not feeling well.

26:45.988 --> 26:47.690
Does he even have any proof?

26:47.715 --> 26:50.554
He doesn't need proof, he has a story.

26:50.579 --> 26:53.533
All he has to do is
post it on social media.

26:53.602 --> 26:55.602
Do you remember what
happened with the photo leak?

26:55.671 --> 26:56.937
It'll be everywhere.

26:57.005 --> 26:59.088
Except now, I'll be a murderer.

26:59.113 --> 27:00.707
So deny it.

27:00.776 --> 27:02.309
It's not gonna help.

27:02.377 --> 27:04.344
People will believe what
they want to believe,

27:04.413 --> 27:06.047
- and they'll wanna believe this...
- No, Megan...

27:06.071 --> 27:07.865
And the thing is, Shaun...

27:07.890 --> 27:09.683
they're right.

27:10.400 --> 27:12.919
It was self-defense.

27:12.988 --> 27:15.021
It doesn't matter.

27:15.090 --> 27:17.123
I can't play chicken with this guy.

27:17.192 --> 27:20.093
I need to make him go away. Quietly.

27:20.652 --> 27:24.998
Because if Kyle finds out,
this whole thing is over.

27:27.202 --> 27:29.402
You sure about that?

27:29.427 --> 27:31.538
I mean, he's the one
person who might have

27:31.607 --> 27:33.173
$5 million lying around.

27:34.479 --> 27:37.900
You think I should ask
Kyle to pay him off?

27:38.647 --> 27:41.514
I think you need to at
least explore the option.

27:41.583 --> 27:44.451
How could I possibly even
tell him something like this?

27:44.519 --> 27:47.120
I lied to him, Shaun.

27:47.189 --> 27:50.223
I looked him in the eye,
and I signed the contract.

27:50.292 --> 27:54.341
- He loves you, Megan.
- I put everything he has at risk.

27:54.366 --> 27:55.903
And you warned me.

27:56.164 --> 27:57.524
- You warned me, and I...
- No, no.

27:57.566 --> 27:59.143
I didn't believe you,
and, God, I'm so stupid.

27:59.167 --> 28:00.660
Okay, okay, Megan.

28:00.685 --> 28:02.402
You cannot waste time
beating yourself up

28:02.471 --> 28:04.182
- about this right now.
- I know... I know, I know.

28:04.206 --> 28:06.239
If you don't want to go
to Kyle for help, fine.

28:06.308 --> 28:07.774
You need to go talk to Terence.

28:09.045 --> 28:11.136
You think Terence is gonna help me?

28:11.179 --> 28:14.614
He's gonna tell me I'm in
breach and watch me burn.

28:14.683 --> 28:16.850
He doesn't want this out
there any more than you do.

28:16.919 --> 28:18.785
This could blow back
on the Institute, too.

28:18.854 --> 28:21.554
Are you kidding, he would
be thrilled to get rid of me.

28:21.623 --> 28:24.384
And I'm sure he'd find a way to
spin it around like everything else.

28:24.409 --> 28:26.693
You don't know that, Megan.

28:27.049 --> 28:29.949
Maybe I should talk to him for you.

28:30.044 --> 28:33.074
What makes you think Terence
is gonna listen to you?

28:33.594 --> 28:37.203
Because... I'm working for him now.

28:37.701 --> 28:39.901
You're what?

28:39.926 --> 28:43.476
I'm gonna be in-house
counsel for the Institute.

28:43.545 --> 28:45.946
No, Megan...

28:46.014 --> 28:47.948
- What?
- Don't freak out, please.

28:48.016 --> 28:49.482
- It's just...
- Wait.

28:49.551 --> 28:51.495
You're his lawyer now?

28:51.520 --> 28:53.686
No, I-I shouldn't have
told you any of this.

28:53.755 --> 28:55.789
Yes, you should have. I can help you.

28:55.857 --> 28:57.991
Shaun, you cannot tell Terence.

28:58.060 --> 29:00.306
- Megan, I would never...
- Please, please promise me

29:00.331 --> 29:01.554
- that you won't say anything.
- Okay!

29:01.578 --> 29:03.058
- Please!
- Okay, Megan, I wouldn't...

29:03.098 --> 29:04.731
- I promise.
- God.

29:04.800 --> 29:07.467
- Megan!
- No, I have to figure this out.

29:32.776 --> 29:34.268
Well, when Mitch signed on,

29:34.307 --> 29:36.207
he brought three other investors, so...

29:36.276 --> 29:37.596
it's official.

29:37.621 --> 29:39.167
The financing is in place.

29:39.212 --> 29:40.678
You're gonna make your movie.

29:40.747 --> 29:43.314
It's great. It's great, yeah.

29:43.383 --> 29:44.916
Hey...

29:44.985 --> 29:46.495
have you heard from
Megan today, by the way?

29:46.519 --> 29:47.952
No, why?

29:48.021 --> 29:49.853
Well, I can't reach her,

29:49.878 --> 29:51.597
and she said she wasn't
feeling well last night,

29:51.621 --> 29:53.291
and she got up and left
really early this morning,

29:53.315 --> 29:55.248
and I don't know, it's
just... it's weird.

29:55.316 --> 29:57.065
Well, she just got engaged, Kyle.

29:57.090 --> 29:59.080
I'm sure she's got a lot on her mind.

30:00.354 --> 30:02.021
Forget it, she's here.

30:02.089 --> 30:04.023
Okay, talk to you soon.

30:04.091 --> 30:05.776
You okay?

30:06.307 --> 30:07.971
What happened?

30:09.398 --> 30:11.377
I'm in trouble...

30:12.041 --> 30:13.768
and I've made a horrible mistake.

30:13.793 --> 30:16.460
Wait, wait, what do you mean?
What are you talking about?

30:19.507 --> 30:21.607
Megan? What is it?

30:29.163 --> 30:33.140
Do you remember what I told
you about my stepbrother...

30:33.165 --> 30:34.687
about what he did to me?

30:34.755 --> 30:36.188
Of course.

30:36.257 --> 30:38.123
Well, I didn't tell you the whole...

30:38.192 --> 30:39.576
story.

30:39.601 --> 30:41.343
Um...

30:42.029 --> 30:46.155
He was killed about six years ago...

30:46.342 --> 30:48.742
and some guy went to jail for it.

30:49.108 --> 30:51.593
And now he's out, and...

30:51.618 --> 30:54.140
he's tracked me down.

30:54.702 --> 30:56.490
What's he want?

30:56.515 --> 30:59.030
He wants money, he wants...

30:59.055 --> 31:02.226
a lot of money, or he's
gonna say that I'm the one...

31:02.251 --> 31:04.149
who killed my stepbrother.

31:05.720 --> 31:08.354
That's bullshit, he can't do
that. Why would he do that?

31:08.422 --> 31:09.766
You know what, we're
gonna shut him down.

31:09.790 --> 31:11.195
- No, Kyle...
- I'll call my lawyer right now.

31:11.219 --> 31:12.991
- Kyle, stop, stop, listen!
- I'll take a...

31:13.016 --> 31:14.460
Listen.

31:15.734 --> 31:17.663
What he's saying...

31:17.732 --> 31:19.343
is true.

31:21.168 --> 31:22.710
No.

31:23.270 --> 31:25.104
It's true.

31:25.172 --> 31:28.173
No, no. No, no, no way.

31:32.230 --> 31:34.641
After my mother died,

31:34.819 --> 31:36.885
all I could think about was...

31:37.048 --> 31:39.173
was finding Evan and confronting him

31:39.198 --> 31:41.275
for what he did to me.

31:41.860 --> 31:43.712
And he... he was in
Hong Kong at the time,

31:43.737 --> 31:45.634
and I just kind of
showed up at his doorstep,

31:45.659 --> 31:47.157
and...

31:47.182 --> 31:50.063
when I finally had enough drinks in me

31:50.088 --> 31:54.087
to talk about what happened, he...

31:54.424 --> 31:56.087
snapped.

31:56.844 --> 31:59.711
And he attacked me, and
I fought back, and it...

31:59.775 --> 32:01.602
it just...

32:02.411 --> 32:04.311
it just happened.

32:08.150 --> 32:10.197
And I was scared, I
didn't know what to do

32:10.222 --> 32:12.343
so I ran, and then...

32:12.388 --> 32:16.110
and then I found out this other
guy went to jail for it, and...

32:18.827 --> 32:21.220
and that's my real story.

32:30.773 --> 32:32.813
I know, I'm sorry.

32:33.329 --> 32:36.110
I should have never signed the contract.

32:36.345 --> 32:38.478
Does this guy have any proof?

32:38.547 --> 32:40.468
Does he need it? I mean, he...

32:40.493 --> 32:41.682
he could hurt us regardless.

32:41.750 --> 32:45.610
He could hurt you, which is
what I'm most concerned about.

32:48.767 --> 32:50.711
How much money does he want?

32:52.461 --> 32:54.394
He wants $5 million by tonight.

32:54.463 --> 32:55.963
- Jesus Christ!
- I know, Kyle.

32:56.031 --> 32:58.298
I'm so sorry to do this to you.

32:58.367 --> 33:00.400
Do what? Lie to me?

33:00.469 --> 33:02.930
Or the $5 million blackmail?

33:03.005 --> 33:05.063
Both.

33:10.338 --> 33:12.613
All right, we're gonna
have to deal with this.

33:14.149 --> 33:15.782
First thing is the money. I-I have it.

33:15.851 --> 33:18.139
I just don't know if I
can get it by tonight.

33:18.164 --> 33:20.821
I'm gonna have to
move some stuff around.

33:20.889 --> 33:24.468
All right, and... and...
and the other thing, the lie.

33:24.493 --> 33:26.360
I know.

33:26.428 --> 33:28.262
I know, I'm sorry.

33:28.330 --> 33:31.469
I will go away, and you will
never have to see me again.

33:31.493 --> 33:34.060
Megan, that's... that's not what I want.

33:37.506 --> 33:39.766
Hey, look.

33:40.476 --> 33:43.438
I love you, okay?

33:43.463 --> 33:46.321
And I'm not gonna lose you over this.

33:49.537 --> 33:52.304
I gotta figure out this money thing.

33:54.093 --> 33:56.115
What can I do to help?

33:56.140 --> 33:59.078
I don't know. I don't know.

34:00.129 --> 34:02.562
I gotta go see my business manager.

34:02.631 --> 34:05.147
Okay, and what if he can't
get the money tonight?

34:05.172 --> 34:07.200
Look, one step at a time, okay?

34:07.269 --> 34:09.569
Just... let me try.

34:09.638 --> 34:11.705
This is what people do in scandals.

34:11.774 --> 34:14.373
Payoffs happen all the time.

34:18.683 --> 34:20.282
Yeah.

34:22.731 --> 34:24.331
Wait, Kyle...

34:25.960 --> 34:28.355
I don't want to lose you either.

34:32.393 --> 34:34.194
Yeah.

34:45.737 --> 34:47.370
- Hey.
- Hi.

34:47.395 --> 34:49.321
You know, I'm gonna be back
in the office in 20 minutes.

34:49.344 --> 34:51.344
What was so important
that it couldn't wait?

34:51.413 --> 34:53.612
I have a serious money situation

34:53.681 --> 34:55.618
that I need to deal with right away.

34:55.643 --> 34:57.684
- Okay, what do you mean?
- Look, I-I...

34:57.753 --> 35:00.057
- I can't tell you the details.
- Megan, if you don't...

35:00.082 --> 35:02.499
Leslie, I'm... I'm serious, I can't.

35:02.524 --> 35:04.624
I just need to know if
it's possible for the Agency

35:04.693 --> 35:07.829
to give me an advance
on my contract with Kyle.

35:07.854 --> 35:09.727
What kind of trouble are you in?

35:09.752 --> 35:12.799
Leslie, is it possible or not?

35:16.472 --> 35:19.206
Does this have anything
to do with what's going on?

35:19.274 --> 35:20.807
I don't know.

35:23.112 --> 35:24.544
Hello, Terence, how are you?

35:24.613 --> 35:25.879
We have a huge problem.

35:25.948 --> 35:27.946
Your client has
committed criminal fraud,

35:27.971 --> 35:30.028
and now the reputations of
both Kyle and the Institute

35:30.052 --> 35:31.585
are at serious risk.

35:31.653 --> 35:33.653
- Criminal fraud?
- My God, Shaun.

35:33.722 --> 35:35.291
Can you slow down? Because
I'm not sure what you mean.

35:35.315 --> 35:36.490
We'll discuss it in person.

35:36.558 --> 35:38.635
Do you know where you client is?

35:39.518 --> 35:41.351
I haven't seen her,

35:41.376 --> 35:44.368
but I will find her,
and I will call you back.

35:44.393 --> 35:46.533
Okay, what the hell is going on?

35:46.602 --> 35:49.069
He knows, it's over.

35:49.138 --> 35:51.505
He knows what? What did you do?

35:51.573 --> 35:53.330
Megan? Megan!

35:53.355 --> 35:55.102
Sit down, let me help you.

35:55.127 --> 35:57.768
No, no one can help me.

36:06.947 --> 36:08.713
Kyle?

36:12.084 --> 36:13.417
Zach?

36:18.631 --> 36:20.543
"Dear Kyle,

36:21.324 --> 36:23.828
"there's no way this
note can truly explain

36:23.896 --> 36:26.379
"all my feelings right now.

36:27.208 --> 36:30.076
"I wish I could look in your
eyes and tell you instead,

36:30.144 --> 36:33.051
"but I'm running out of time,

36:33.076 --> 36:35.214
"and I know you'd want
to stop me from doing

36:35.283 --> 36:38.557
"what I know needs to be
done to get us out of this.

36:38.582 --> 36:42.746
"It's time for me to face the
consequences for what I did,

36:42.777 --> 36:45.524
"and the only way to make sure
I don't bring you down with me

36:45.593 --> 36:47.927
"is to face these consequences alone.

36:47.995 --> 36:51.731
"If I run now, you can still
distance yourself from me,

36:51.799 --> 36:54.367
"the opportunist who
deceived you to get her shot"

36:54.435 --> 36:57.169
"at being famous. It's a great story,"

36:57.238 --> 37:01.040
"and the best solution to
this situation I put you in."

37:08.416 --> 37:11.574
"I only hope you can believe the truth,"

37:11.599 --> 37:13.356
"that I love you"

37:13.381 --> 37:16.745
"and I love every
moment we spent together."

37:16.791 --> 37:19.759
"And I am so, so sorry."

37:23.164 --> 37:24.530
Kyle?

37:26.997 --> 37:28.567
What are you doing here?

37:28.636 --> 37:30.102
Megan.

37:30.171 --> 37:32.161
Everything's gonna be okay.

37:52.193 --> 37:54.586
Okay, let me know when you get there.

38:02.657 --> 38:04.491
They're on their way.

38:10.062 --> 38:11.834
How're you doing?

38:13.114 --> 38:15.981
Not feeling very grounded right now.

38:22.692 --> 38:25.381
I really hope this works.

38:28.129 --> 38:29.862
I believe it will.

38:31.999 --> 38:34.110
And Kyle?

38:36.737 --> 38:39.329
Kyle and I are gonna be good again.

38:40.961 --> 38:43.108
Let me out of here, please.

38:43.177 --> 38:45.368
Please stop!

38:45.446 --> 38:47.480
Stop the van! Stop!

38:47.548 --> 38:49.081
Stop the van!

38:49.150 --> 38:51.283
Stop the van, stop it!

38:51.352 --> 38:54.186
Please...

38:57.492 --> 38:59.391
Please...

38:59.460 --> 39:01.026
Stop...

39:01.095 --> 39:02.328
Stop the van!

39:02.396 --> 39:04.296
Stop! Help me!

39:07.510 --> 39:10.847
Please, please, please, stop, please.

39:10.872 --> 39:12.738
Please...

39:12.807 --> 39:14.540
Please!

39:14.565 --> 39:17.687
Please stop the van! Stop!

39:17.712 --> 39:20.246
Stop the van!

40:00.054 --> 40:02.873
Megan, we're here.

40:10.097 --> 40:11.797
Megan!

40:11.866 --> 40:13.899
There's nowhere to run.

40:29.283 --> 40:30.716
Megan.

40:35.890 --> 40:37.590
Nina?

40:37.658 --> 40:39.058
What the hell is this?

40:39.126 --> 40:40.725
I know you're feeling scared,

40:40.750 --> 40:42.795
but we're actually here to help you.

40:43.281 --> 40:46.365
I work for the Institute.
I have for a very long time.

40:46.434 --> 40:49.023
I thought you were a journalist.

40:49.625 --> 40:52.586
Well, that was a part of
a test, which you passed.

40:53.641 --> 40:55.507
Unfortunately, you failed some others,

40:55.576 --> 40:57.826
which is why you're here.

40:57.851 --> 41:00.479
Where? What is this place?

41:00.548 --> 41:03.718
This is a facility for
Individual Transformation.

41:03.789 --> 41:05.734
Transforma...

41:05.851 --> 41:08.107
Does Kyle know I'm here?

41:08.132 --> 41:10.689
The best thing you can do
right now is come with me.

41:16.312 --> 41:17.836
Hello, Megan.

41:18.055 --> 41:20.375
Don't be afraid. I'm not gonna hurt you.

41:21.016 --> 41:22.547
Stop it!

41:22.609 --> 41:24.875
You buried your true self.

41:24.914 --> 41:27.516
All we're trying to do is
help you dig down to find it.

41:27.541 --> 41:29.540
- Kyle!
- I'm here.

41:29.565 --> 41:31.198
Kyle, no!

41:31.229 --> 41:32.586
Kyle, no!

41:34.133 --> 41:36.086
Megan, this is real life.

41:37.047 --> 41:39.180
Do you really want to live
the rest of it in fear?
