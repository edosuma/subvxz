WEBVTT

01:00.460 --> 01:02.696
Previously
on RuPaul's Drag Race...

01:02.696 --> 01:05.232
You need to create
your own unique look

01:05.232 --> 01:08.702
using only the junk
inside these trunks.

01:08.702 --> 01:09.803
This is my first dress
I'm making.

01:12.039 --> 01:13.740
Hey, what's up?
It's Miley Cyrus.

01:13.740 --> 01:16.076
I wanted to go undercover
with the ladies.

01:16.076 --> 01:19.179
-Wait a minute.
-Aah!

01:21.081 --> 01:22.082
Drag Race is crazy.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.517
Soju.

01:23.517 --> 01:24.651
The tulle is
hitting at different lengths.

01:24.651 --> 01:25.652
There's giant knots
in the back.

01:25.652 --> 01:28.188
Kahanna Montrese.

01:28.188 --> 01:30.190
How would you describe
your drag?

01:30.190 --> 01:31.959
This is not a good
representation of my drag.

01:33.393 --> 01:34.461
Brooke Lynn Hytes.

01:34.461 --> 01:36.530
That is a mic drop, bitch.

01:36.530 --> 01:38.765
-It's that star power.
-Thank you.

01:38.765 --> 01:41.401
You are the winner
of this week's challenge.

01:41.401 --> 01:43.704
Kahanna Montrese,
shantay you stay.

01:43.704 --> 01:44.771
Thank you so much.

01:44.771 --> 01:47.407
Soju, sashay away.

01:55.682 --> 01:58.752
Oh, girl.

01:58.752 --> 02:01.021
-Rough.
-First one done.

02:01.021 --> 02:02.222
Literally the hardest thing

02:02.222 --> 02:04.257
I think I've ever
had to do in my life.

02:04.257 --> 02:08.562
Soju. "I love all of you
cysters."

02:08.562 --> 02:10.497
That's fun.

02:10.497 --> 02:12.432
We miss you, cyst.

02:12.432 --> 02:14.534
-Oh, cyst.
-Disgusting.

02:14.534 --> 02:16.503
So on the runway,

02:16.503 --> 02:18.972
Soju starts to talk about
how she has a cyst

02:18.972 --> 02:20.874
on her...taint.

02:20.874 --> 02:22.376
I grew a cyst

02:22.376 --> 02:24.578
and then it popped
in the plane ride here.

02:24.578 --> 02:28.548
So like right now I'm oozing,
and it's just been a messy week.

02:28.548 --> 02:32.319
She was like,
it's actually leaking now.

02:32.319 --> 02:35.222
There's just some things
you don't do.

02:35.222 --> 02:37.124
I don't give a fuck
if it was inflamed

02:37.124 --> 02:38.759
to the size
of "Guantamano" Bay.

02:38.759 --> 02:41.561
You never say "cyst"
when Mama Ru's in your presence.

02:41.561 --> 02:43.063
Girl!

02:43.063 --> 02:43.964
Congratulations, mama.

02:46.733 --> 02:47.734
How do you feel, girl?

02:47.734 --> 02:49.302
I feel amazing.

02:49.302 --> 02:51.171
Go ahead.
Go to Paris, girl.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.106
Let her go on her trip
tomorrow.

02:53.106 --> 02:54.541
We're watching you now, girl.

02:54.541 --> 02:56.510
Go ahead.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.311
Not only did I survive
the first elimination,

02:58.311 --> 03:00.380
I thrived
in the first elimination.

03:02.449 --> 03:05.419
I was disappointed that I
didn't win the first challenge.

03:05.419 --> 03:07.554
When we were talking,
a lot of the girls said

03:07.554 --> 03:10.357
that my dress was something
that they would actually wear.

03:12.225 --> 03:15.162
Scarlet is delusional.

03:15.162 --> 03:16.463
I'm gonna say
this is a beautiful dress,

03:16.463 --> 03:18.265
but I'm looking at it now

03:18.265 --> 03:20.634
and I see tons of holes.

03:22.436 --> 03:24.671
Believe it.

03:24.671 --> 03:27.207
Girl. Bitch.

03:27.207 --> 03:30.143
Brooke Lynn
won the first challenge.

03:30.143 --> 03:32.045
I'm gonna cry
this feels so good.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.747
So of course
she's feeling her oats

03:33.747 --> 03:35.515
the hardest of everyone.

03:35.515 --> 03:37.684
♪ We going to Paris ♪

03:37.684 --> 03:40.153
♪ We going to Paris ♪

03:40.153 --> 03:42.222
When you feel your own oats
so hard,

03:42.222 --> 03:44.324
you forget that
there are other oats there.

03:44.324 --> 03:47.961
And to discount anyone
in this competition...

03:50.397 --> 03:51.998
is a huge mistake.

03:56.503 --> 03:58.138
[RuPaul] The winner
of RuPaul's Drag Race

03:58.138 --> 03:59.506
receives a one-year supply

03:59.506 --> 04:02.142
of Anastasia Beverly Hills
cosmetics

04:02.142 --> 04:05.979
and a cash prize of $100.000.

04:05.979 --> 04:09.049
With extra-special
guest judges Sydelle Noel

04:09.049 --> 04:10.550
and Bobby Moynihan.

04:24.131 --> 04:25.465
Miss Vanjie is still here.

04:25.465 --> 04:27.300
I'm here to deliver.

04:27.300 --> 04:28.635
I ain't walking backwards
no time soon.

04:28.635 --> 04:30.070
Catch that.

04:30.070 --> 04:32.105
I'm about to get
some shit started now.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.007
As always. What's new?

04:34.007 --> 04:36.643
Bang, marry, kill.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.013
You start first, baby.

04:40.013 --> 04:41.414
-Oh, my God.
-Careful. Careful.

04:41.414 --> 04:43.150
I know.
This is a hard one.

04:43.150 --> 04:44.151
I'd marry Plastique.

04:44.151 --> 04:46.553
As Bianca Del Rio says,

04:46.553 --> 04:49.756
beauty fades, bitch.
Beauty fades.

04:49.756 --> 04:51.124
You gotta get you a bitch

04:51.124 --> 04:53.293
that can fry some chicken
like me, bitch.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.495
I would bang Silky.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.567
All right, all right.

05:00.567 --> 05:03.136
And he would also kill Silky.

05:03.136 --> 05:03.703
Yeah, I feel like
I would have to.

05:05.572 --> 05:08.441
So much for that chicken, girl.

05:08.441 --> 05:10.277
I'm deciding backward.
I'm gonna kill Silky.

05:12.245 --> 05:13.647
And I would definitely
have to kill Silky.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.715
Is everybody gonna kill me?

05:15.715 --> 05:16.683
Bitch, I'll kill
all the rest of you,

05:16.683 --> 05:17.784
'cause somebody's got to win.

05:17.784 --> 05:18.985
That's the only way
you will win.

05:22.289 --> 05:24.558
Oh, girl!

05:24.558 --> 05:28.061
She done already
done had herses.

05:28.061 --> 05:29.062
Hey, tootsies.

05:31.097 --> 05:32.465
Wanna be queen of the desert?

05:32.465 --> 05:35.001
Because some do like it hot.

05:35.001 --> 05:37.304
Strap on those kinky boots,

05:37.304 --> 05:39.306
don't forget your hair spray,

05:39.306 --> 05:41.741
and thanks for everything,
Julie Newmar.

05:44.644 --> 05:46.880
Hello, hello, hello.

05:48.748 --> 05:50.050
Hey, it's Ru, bitch.

05:50.050 --> 05:53.153
Ladies, America's
next drag superstar

05:53.153 --> 05:56.456
needs to know how to pull focus.

05:56.456 --> 05:59.359
So today, you'll be
stealing the spotlight

05:59.359 --> 06:02.062
in one of my favorite
mini challenges:

06:02.062 --> 06:05.599
the celebrity photobomb.

06:05.599 --> 06:10.303
The two queens who are the most
extra at photobombing win.

06:10.303 --> 06:12.572
-Okay.
-#DragRace.

06:12.572 --> 06:15.475
Now, you have 15 minutes
to get into quick drag.

06:15.475 --> 06:17.077
Ready, set, go!

06:19.145 --> 06:21.748
What the fuck, bitch?

06:21.748 --> 06:24.584
Girl, this is ricky ticky, baby.

06:24.584 --> 06:26.152
Time's up, ladies.

06:26.152 --> 06:28.755
All right, first up, Nina West.

06:28.755 --> 06:30.357
Now, you're going to be
photobombing

06:30.357 --> 06:32.425
Cardi B at the VMAs.

06:32.425 --> 06:35.028
I am her long-lost
second cousin Sennahe.

06:35.028 --> 06:36.429
-Sennawho?
-Sennahe?

06:36.429 --> 06:38.298
-Sennawhat?
-Sennehe, dear.

06:38.298 --> 06:40.133
-Ooh, girl.
-Big uhh!.

06:40.133 --> 06:42.035
Say queen.

06:42.035 --> 06:44.004
Now, you're
going to be photobombing

06:44.004 --> 06:46.206
Amber Rose doing a selfie.

06:46.206 --> 06:48.141
I'm just going to be
like straddling her?

06:48.141 --> 06:50.043
-Get in there.
-Oh, yeah.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.378
-Give it to me.
-I'm just like shook.

06:52.679 --> 06:54.748
[RuPaul] Oh, you are shook.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.349
Are you the flower girl?

06:56.349 --> 06:57.917
No, I was supposed
to be the wedding girl.

06:59.486 --> 07:01.488
I'm so sad.

07:01.488 --> 07:04.090
I'm gonna snap.

07:04.090 --> 07:08.495
You're going to be photobombing
Tom Brady making a pass.

07:08.495 --> 07:10.697
Silky sometimes brings
all the ho out in me.

07:10.697 --> 07:12.966
Tom Brady
about to get all of this.

07:15.201 --> 07:18.171
Ain't no Deflategate
going on here, girl.

07:18.171 --> 07:19.706
You're not modest at all.

07:19.706 --> 07:21.374
Oh, what you--
oh, you gonna show more?

07:21.374 --> 07:23.543
Oh, girl.
Oh, let me catch all of this.

07:23.543 --> 07:25.378
Get these cookies.

07:27.981 --> 07:29.749
Yes to all that
Silky Ganache.

07:29.749 --> 07:33.119
Touchdown!

07:33.119 --> 07:34.454
What's your favorite
Celine song?

07:34.454 --> 07:36.289
Good old Titanic,
My Heart Will Go On.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.357
How boring.

07:39.092 --> 07:41.027
Yeah, you right up in there.

07:41.027 --> 07:42.996
Look at you.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.597
You're so pretty.

07:44.597 --> 07:45.598
Oh, sis.

07:45.598 --> 07:47.233
Oh, sis.

07:47.233 --> 07:48.401
That's gorgeous.

07:48.401 --> 07:52.505
God. Oh, oh, that's hot.

07:52.505 --> 07:54.441
You think Mariah's
never seen that before?

07:54.441 --> 07:57.143
The shade of it all.

07:57.143 --> 07:58.611
You wanna see Shallow Hal?

07:58.611 --> 08:01.147
Bitch, here's your Shallow Hal.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.483
That's a mouthful.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.584
Oh, you want his autograph.

08:04.584 --> 08:06.252
Nice.

08:06.252 --> 08:09.122
N-N-Nicki Minaj.

08:09.122 --> 08:12.258
Her anaconda don't,
but yours do.

08:12.258 --> 08:14.060
Brooke Lynn Hytes
and the Macrons

08:14.060 --> 08:15.662
and some other people.

08:15.662 --> 08:18.064
Oh, okay, yeah.

08:18.064 --> 08:19.699
I think I'll get
a few extra ones of this one.

08:19.699 --> 08:22.168
Impressive how you can

08:22.168 --> 08:23.703
keep your legs up like that
for so long.

08:23.703 --> 08:25.438
I've had lots of practice.

08:27.140 --> 08:29.442
Welcome to America.

08:29.442 --> 08:31.378
Kellyanne Conway

08:31.378 --> 08:34.347
with the leaders
of the Black Caucus.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.983
I'm checking
if she's wearing panties.

08:39.052 --> 08:40.754
She's just gonna
take a little nap.

08:40.754 --> 08:43.256
I think Bush
is back in the White House.

08:43.256 --> 08:46.726
Ra'Jah O'Hara
photobombing Anna Wintour.

08:46.726 --> 08:48.228
I'm with this bitch
right here.

08:48.228 --> 08:49.729
Yes, mommy.

08:49.729 --> 08:53.233
You're going to be photobombing
Madonna and Kim K.

08:53.233 --> 08:54.367
Get 'em like this, mommy.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.136
-Okay. Yeah, yeah, mama.
-Get those cookies.

08:56.136 --> 08:58.471
Ooh, coo-coo-coo-cookies.

08:58.471 --> 09:00.373
What the f-stop?

09:00.373 --> 09:03.710
Ladies,
two of you really bombed.

09:03.710 --> 09:06.212
In a good way.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.414
Brooke Lynn Hytes.

09:09.215 --> 09:10.517
Thank you.

09:10.517 --> 09:12.719
And Silky Nutmeg Ganache.

09:15.455 --> 09:19.993
You've each won
a $1.000 gift certificate

09:19.993 --> 09:22.695
from Fierce Queen.

09:22.695 --> 09:26.466
Ladies, Hollywood
is breaking stereotypes

09:26.466 --> 09:28.568
and box office records

09:28.568 --> 09:32.739
with blockbuster films
celebrating black empowerment.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.974
And now it's our turn.

09:34.974 --> 09:37.577
Now, for this week's
maxi challenge,

09:37.577 --> 09:41.247
you'll be starring
in two breakthrough films

09:41.247 --> 09:45.919
featuring, get this,
an all drag queen cast.

09:51.524 --> 09:56.329
Now, the first film is called
Good God Girl, Get Out!

09:58.331 --> 10:00.333
Now, the second film is called

10:00.333 --> 10:02.402
Why It Gotta Be Black,

10:02.402 --> 10:05.004
Panther?

10:05.004 --> 10:07.440
Now, you'll work in two teams.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.677
Brooke Lynn and Silky,
you're team captains.

10:10.677 --> 10:13.046
You get to choose your cast.

10:13.046 --> 10:15.348
All right, Suzanne Somers.

10:15.348 --> 10:18.418
I mean, Brooke Lynn,
you choose first.

10:18.418 --> 10:19.419
Nina West.

10:19.419 --> 10:21.354
Let's get some drag empowerment.

10:21.354 --> 10:23.056
Silky Nutmeg Ganache.

10:23.056 --> 10:25.191
-A'Keria.
-All right.

10:25.191 --> 10:27.961
-Come on, Ra'Jah.
-All right, girl.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.462
Miss Vanjie.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.531
Come on, bitch, let's do this.

10:31.531 --> 10:32.465
Honey, Honey, Honey, Honey.

10:32.465 --> 10:35.235
Mercedes.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.504
-Come give me some Shuga.
-Yes!

10:37.504 --> 10:38.671
Yvie.

10:38.671 --> 10:39.973
Okie diddly dokey.

10:42.308 --> 10:44.744
-Plastique Fantastique.
-Thank you.

10:44.744 --> 10:47.213
-Kahanna.
-Silky, Silky, Silky, Silky.

10:47.213 --> 10:51.017
Now, that leaves Scarlet Envy
and Ariel Versace.

10:52.519 --> 10:54.153
Ariel, come be part
of this world.

10:54.153 --> 10:56.022
Thanks, bitch.

10:56.022 --> 10:58.525
Miss Scarlet
is looking pressed

10:58.525 --> 11:00.026
like a panini, bitch.

11:00.026 --> 11:01.227
She is pissed off.

11:01.227 --> 11:03.563
Which means, Scarlet Envy

11:03.563 --> 11:07.000
is with Team Silky
Nutmeg Ganache.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.935
Come on, bitch,
I got Scarlet fever. Come on.

11:10.303 --> 11:12.171
I should not be the last pick,

11:12.171 --> 11:14.440
especially
on an acting challenge.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.743
I am Julia Roberts
in Pretty Woman.

11:16.743 --> 11:18.745
Big mistake.

11:18.745 --> 11:19.779
Huge.

11:19.779 --> 11:23.516
Gentlemen, start your engines,

11:23.516 --> 11:25.785
and may the best woman win.

11:27.587 --> 11:30.089
Silky's team, they're
a lot of big personalities.

11:30.089 --> 11:32.458
It's gonna be chaos.

11:32.458 --> 11:35.195
Like...girl.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.229
Good luck.

11:37.797 --> 11:39.199
For today's maxi challenge,

11:39.199 --> 11:41.234
we are going to be acting
in hit movies.

11:41.234 --> 11:43.469
This is our first
big acting challenge,

11:43.469 --> 11:46.139
so we really got to impress them
at this point.

11:46.139 --> 11:48.141
I don't know
if this is too stereotypical,

11:48.141 --> 11:49.642
but if you could read Nails

11:49.642 --> 11:52.312
in like a Vietnamese
like nail technician.

11:52.312 --> 11:53.613
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God, okay.

11:55.181 --> 11:57.517
Dragkanda is a mystical land

11:57.517 --> 11:58.718
where drag queens run free

11:58.718 --> 12:00.219
-and wigs grow on trees.
-That's it.

12:00.219 --> 12:00.987
Can I take that?

12:02.422 --> 12:05.291
I have very little
acting experience.

12:05.291 --> 12:07.293
However,
I wanted to show the judges

12:07.293 --> 12:10.730
I can be more than just
the prettiest one, so...

12:10.730 --> 12:12.298
All right, ladies.

12:12.298 --> 12:15.268
I want the main role
to go to Scarlet.

12:15.268 --> 12:18.004
I want you to get real white
on that, honey.

12:18.004 --> 12:20.373
I don't know if Silky
is trying to sabotage me

12:20.373 --> 12:22.275
by giving me the most lines
to memorize,

12:22.275 --> 12:24.711
but, I mean,
this is the lead role.

12:24.711 --> 12:26.412
This is where I belong.

12:26.412 --> 12:29.015
And then we got Kahanna
as Henrietta.

12:29.015 --> 12:30.650
I'm looking at the script,

12:30.650 --> 12:33.553
and I'm seeing
there's only two lines.

12:33.553 --> 12:37.523
I'm just super worried
that my lines are so short.

12:37.523 --> 12:38.524
No, but that's the thing.

12:38.524 --> 12:40.059
You've seen this in the past.

12:40.059 --> 12:41.227
Like you just punch them out.

12:41.227 --> 12:43.096
So you're at an advantage.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.030
You don't have to memorize much.

12:44.030 --> 12:45.465
I really don't know

12:45.465 --> 12:47.100
which direction to go in
with this character,

12:47.100 --> 12:50.370
but after having to lip sync
for my life last week,

12:50.370 --> 12:51.537
I've got to bring it
to the table.

12:51.537 --> 12:53.740
Let's read, bitch.

12:53.740 --> 12:55.575
Marnie, we're driving
all the way

12:55.575 --> 12:57.210
to visit your
heterosexual parents,

12:57.210 --> 12:59.679
but do they know
I'm a drag queen?

12:59.679 --> 13:05.418
Oh, Christine, I'm just a plain
old hetero-normative girl.

13:05.418 --> 13:08.688
Now you're in
the between-me-down-there.

13:08.688 --> 13:10.556
What the fuck is that?

13:10.556 --> 13:12.425
Baby, I'm looking at this script

13:12.425 --> 13:14.093
like it's the Da Vinci Code
or some shit.

13:14.093 --> 13:16.396
I don't even know
what is on this paper.

13:16.396 --> 13:17.664
I need somebody to give me
some syllables or something.

13:17.664 --> 13:19.165
I don't know.

13:19.165 --> 13:20.566
I mean, you're not really
supposed to know

13:20.566 --> 13:21.534
what it is, anyway, so it
kind of makes sense, you know.

13:21.534 --> 13:22.702
Well, I really don't know.

13:22.702 --> 13:25.104
Method, honey, method.

13:25.104 --> 13:27.306
Right. It's my first
acting challenge,

13:27.306 --> 13:29.642
and I know, baby,
the pressure is on.

13:29.642 --> 13:32.278
I gotta show that I can channel
all this bullshit energy

13:32.278 --> 13:34.480
that I got into some
shit constructive.

13:36.616 --> 13:39.085
Hey, kitty girls.

13:39.085 --> 13:40.553
-Hey, Ru.
-Hey.

13:43.089 --> 13:44.590
-Hello, team.
-Hi, Ru.

13:44.590 --> 13:47.026
-So you're the team leader.
-Uh-huh.

13:47.026 --> 13:47.760
How did you assign roles?

13:47.760 --> 13:49.529
I picked the people

13:49.529 --> 13:51.497
I thought had the strongest
theater backgrounds,

13:51.497 --> 13:54.233
and people I thought worked well
as a group together.

13:54.233 --> 13:58.471
So who on the other team do you
all think is the one to beat?

13:58.471 --> 14:00.440
Are there any theater majors
over there?

14:00.440 --> 14:02.241
Not that I know of.

14:02.241 --> 14:04.043
I feel like there's a
lot of personality over there,

14:04.043 --> 14:06.245
and it might...clash.
-Clash.

14:06.245 --> 14:08.414
Who on the other team
is problematic?

14:08.414 --> 14:11.150
I think their team captain
is a little problematic.

14:11.150 --> 14:14.187
She's very loud,
she's a big personality,

14:14.187 --> 14:16.656
and I feel like at this point,

14:16.656 --> 14:21.027
she's not gonna let anybody else
on her team shine over her.

14:21.027 --> 14:24.297
So they might be in trouble.

14:24.297 --> 14:26.999
Has anyone else on this team
experienced that?

14:26.999 --> 14:29.469
I think we've all
experienced it

14:29.469 --> 14:30.536
-being in the workroom.
-How could you not?

14:30.536 --> 14:32.638
Yeah, she knows she's on TV

14:32.638 --> 14:34.040
and she's gonna get her moment

14:34.040 --> 14:36.209
and they're gonna see her.

14:36.209 --> 14:37.543
She's gonna get her TV time.

14:37.543 --> 14:39.278
Like when we were in
with Miley,

14:39.278 --> 14:41.247
she picked her up,
she was on her back.

14:41.247 --> 14:44.283
Like, it was all her,
and it's just a lot.

14:44.283 --> 14:46.719
Wow. Are you all
trying to one-up her

14:46.719 --> 14:48.554
in the attitude department?

14:48.554 --> 14:50.790
-No.
-I don't think so.

14:50.790 --> 14:52.792
No? Well, you might want
to think about it.

14:52.792 --> 14:54.527
You know. You know.

14:54.527 --> 14:55.795
I just think that
there's a difference

14:55.795 --> 14:57.830
between having a strong
personality and being obnoxious.

15:00.199 --> 15:03.970
-Okurrr, damn.
-I mean, listen.

15:03.970 --> 15:05.404
Whatever.

15:05.404 --> 15:07.006
Well, I'm gonna
go check in with her

15:07.006 --> 15:07.874
and see what she says
about you guys.

15:11.444 --> 15:13.546
All right, well, get to it.
Make me laugh.

15:13.546 --> 15:14.614
Thank you, Ru.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.250
Hey, ladies.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.484
-Hi, Ru.
-Hi.

15:18.484 --> 15:21.220
So, Silky, why did you
choose these girls?

15:21.220 --> 15:23.055
I wanted all girls of color
and one white girl.

15:23.055 --> 15:24.657
So you're racially profiling.

15:26.292 --> 15:27.660
So, now, Silky,

15:27.660 --> 15:30.129
would you say you're a success
as a team leader?

15:30.129 --> 15:32.698
I am successful because
I have a successful cast.

15:32.698 --> 15:35.101
Well, the other team

15:35.101 --> 15:37.170
had some words
about your performance,

15:37.170 --> 15:39.939
not just in this challenge,
but about before.

15:41.707 --> 15:43.276
Did you hear any of the Tee?

15:43.276 --> 15:45.411
No, tell me the Tee.
What's the Tee?

15:45.411 --> 15:48.481
Well, they're saying that you
dominate all the conversations

15:48.481 --> 15:51.417
and they can't get
a word in edgewise,

15:51.417 --> 15:53.519
and you suck the air
out of the room.

15:53.519 --> 15:56.856
I'm sorry that I was given
a big straw to suck.

16:00.359 --> 16:02.628
Tell me,
how big is that straw?

16:02.628 --> 16:04.697
Real big, Ru.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.135
You know what?

16:09.135 --> 16:11.003
Certain people have a perception
about me at this point.

16:11.003 --> 16:12.672
This is something
that many of you may not know,

16:12.672 --> 16:15.441
but I have a master's degree
in organizational leadership.

16:15.441 --> 16:17.476
-Really?
-I actually do,

16:17.476 --> 16:19.745
and I just applied for the Ph.D.
program in global leadership.

16:19.745 --> 16:22.682
So when business come,
I'm gonna go handle business.

16:22.682 --> 16:25.318
But when it's time for pleasure,
I'm gonna have pleasure.

16:30.189 --> 16:31.257
How about that?

16:31.257 --> 16:33.726
Well, good God, girl,
get it on.

16:33.726 --> 16:38.431
Look, I cannot wait
to see this movie

16:38.431 --> 16:41.100
by the future
Dr. Silky Ganache.

16:41.100 --> 16:42.735
Remember your lines,

16:42.735 --> 16:45.304
and let the other kids either
have a word in edgewise or not.

16:45.304 --> 16:46.606
Or not.

16:46.606 --> 16:49.075
Thanks, Ru.

16:49.075 --> 16:52.078
That's so ridiculous.

16:52.078 --> 16:53.379
The other team got to go.

16:53.379 --> 16:57.416
They have criticized me
and my leadership skills.

16:57.416 --> 16:59.552
They have talked about me
like a dog.

16:59.552 --> 17:01.687
They have drug me
through the mud.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.422
It really, really pisses me off.

17:03.422 --> 17:05.291
If that's what y'all
think about me for real,

17:05.291 --> 17:06.959
I'm glad I chose
the bitches I chose.

17:06.959 --> 17:10.029
You mad 'cause you ain't
on the team, bitch.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.231
Girl, you're the team leader.

17:12.231 --> 17:14.367
If you fall apart,
we're all lost as hell.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.635
Boy, them bitches
done pissed me off.

17:15.635 --> 17:18.604
They have just
worked my nerves, honey.

17:18.604 --> 17:22.241
Good God, girl,
snap the hell out of it.

17:24.010 --> 17:25.711
It's time for our team
to shoot our movie

17:25.711 --> 17:27.113
with Ross and Michelle.

17:27.113 --> 17:29.048
Instantly
I already get nervous.

17:29.048 --> 17:32.351
Hi, ladies.
Welcome to the set

17:32.351 --> 17:33.452
of Why It Gotta Be Black,
Panther?

17:33.452 --> 17:35.555
All right,
let's go to Dragkanda.

17:35.555 --> 17:38.391
Places, ladies, places.

17:38.391 --> 17:39.458
And action.

17:39.458 --> 17:41.627
Great-Aunt Max'ine,
is that you?

17:41.627 --> 17:45.064
There is a rival panther
coming for your crown.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.300
-Beyon-what?
-Cut.

17:47.300 --> 17:50.036
-Brooke Lynn, Beyoncé what.
-Beyoncé what.

17:50.036 --> 17:52.271
Yeah, so make sure you get out
the Beyoncé into what.

17:52.271 --> 17:54.173
Beyoncé what?

17:54.173 --> 17:57.209
Brooke Lynn, do you understand
the Beyoncé what line?

17:57.209 --> 18:00.513
Just get that "cé",
"Beyon-cé" what?

18:00.513 --> 18:01.580
Okay.

18:01.580 --> 18:02.648
So we know it's the "say what."

18:02.648 --> 18:04.317
That's the joke, you see.

18:04.317 --> 18:06.319
Beyoncé what?

18:06.319 --> 18:07.320
Action.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.255
Beyoncé what?

18:09.255 --> 18:11.590
If you stay woke... [coughs]

18:11.590 --> 18:13.492
You won't need to get woke.

18:13.492 --> 18:15.094
And cut.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.964
Yeah, Auntie Max'ine,
I really like what you're doing.

18:17.964 --> 18:19.465
One quick note.

18:19.465 --> 18:21.133
I've seen people do marijuana.

18:21.133 --> 18:23.703
They inhale and then sometimes
they talk when it's in there,

18:23.703 --> 18:24.737
and then exhale.

18:24.737 --> 18:26.005
Try it there.

18:26.005 --> 18:27.106
And action.

18:29.308 --> 18:33.412
If you stay woke...
you won't need to get woke.

18:36.182 --> 18:37.683
Nailed it.

18:37.683 --> 18:41.687
So here we are in
Sissy's drag closet laboratory

18:41.687 --> 18:43.055
with all her gadgets.

18:43.055 --> 18:45.057
And action.

18:45.057 --> 18:46.993
Chicago Black Panther

18:46.993 --> 18:50.129
is coming to try to snatch
my crown, and I need your help.

18:50.129 --> 18:53.065
Girl, Chicago Black Panther?

18:53.065 --> 18:55.501
Girl, I follow her on Instagram.

18:55.501 --> 18:57.203
Have you see her?

18:57.203 --> 18:59.238
Girl, all I'm saying is

18:59.238 --> 19:01.207
if it's a battle of looks
between the two of you,

19:01.207 --> 19:03.242
girl, you gonna lose.

19:03.242 --> 19:07.113
Cut. Ariel, your adding
the affectation

19:07.113 --> 19:10.549
of "girl" onto everything.
Don't need it.

19:10.549 --> 19:13.019
Let's pluck a couple
of those girls out of there.

19:13.019 --> 19:14.553
-Okay.
-Action.

19:14.553 --> 19:17.289
Chicago Panther is coming
to try to snatch my crown.

19:17.289 --> 19:18.357
I need your help.

19:18.357 --> 19:21.027
Girl, I follow her
on Instagram.

19:21.027 --> 19:22.695
Have you seen her?

19:22.695 --> 19:25.231
These killer heels,

19:25.231 --> 19:28.567
well, girl, they will
make your booty pop.

19:28.567 --> 19:30.403
Okay, let's move on
to the next scene. Thank you.

19:32.238 --> 19:35.674
Not only am I the legitimate
heir to the throne of Dragkanda,

19:35.674 --> 19:37.209
I'm legitimately hotter.

19:37.209 --> 19:38.477
Right, Nails?

19:38.477 --> 19:41.280
Whatever you say, Chicago.

19:41.280 --> 19:43.616
But now that
we are inside Dragkanda,

19:43.616 --> 19:47.486
I can get my hands on the
all-powerful charisminum.

19:47.486 --> 19:48.754
[laughs]

19:48.754 --> 19:50.690
Now give me the charisminum

19:50.690 --> 19:52.124
or feel my wrath!

19:56.295 --> 19:57.696
Can you say it again for me?

19:57.696 --> 19:58.531
Charisminum.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.102
And action.

20:03.102 --> 20:06.439
Chicago Panther and Nails
have breached the panty shield.

20:06.439 --> 20:08.641
Oh, no,
I think they're coming.

20:11.177 --> 20:15.247
Not only am I the legitimate--
I'm sorry.

20:15.247 --> 20:16.115
Why don't we go back
to the top?

20:16.115 --> 20:17.383
Why don't we go back?

20:17.383 --> 20:19.051
Do I hit the spot
and then say the line?

20:19.051 --> 20:20.119
Take a few steps and start.

20:20.119 --> 20:22.621
And action.

20:22.621 --> 20:24.957
Not only am I
the le...gitimate--

20:24.957 --> 20:26.959
Ra'Jah, have fun.

20:26.959 --> 20:28.094
Don't get caught up
in the lines.

20:28.094 --> 20:29.228
You look stressed.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.464
And your character is so badass

20:31.464 --> 20:33.532
that you can't look like
you're thinking.

20:33.532 --> 20:35.201
Okay.

20:35.201 --> 20:36.435
This is going to be
your last take,

20:36.435 --> 20:38.104
so really go for it, okay?

20:38.104 --> 20:38.971
Action.

20:40.740 --> 20:43.709
Not only am I the legitimate
queen of Dragkanda,

20:43.709 --> 20:46.545
I'm also legitimately hotter.

20:49.682 --> 20:51.550
This is not good for Ra'Jah.

20:51.550 --> 20:54.286
There--there's danger,
Will Robinson.

20:54.286 --> 20:57.022
That's a wrap on
Why It Gotta Be Black, Panther?

20:57.022 --> 21:00.526
Oh, God, Ra'Jah.
This fucking sucks.

21:00.526 --> 21:04.530
That's how I'm feeling
right now.

21:04.530 --> 21:07.600
This is me waving
a white flag of surrender.

21:10.202 --> 21:12.471
-Hi, ladies.
-Hello.

21:12.471 --> 21:13.772
Ladies?

21:13.772 --> 21:16.075
I definitely don't look like
no lady right now.

21:16.075 --> 21:18.244
Our moment is here,
so I have to turn the party.

21:18.244 --> 21:20.246
I gotta be a standout
in this group.

21:20.246 --> 21:22.548
Come on, Beyoncé.

21:22.548 --> 21:26.252
Welcome to the set of
Good God Girl, Get Out!

21:26.252 --> 21:29.388
I love it.
We got some flavor up in here.

21:29.388 --> 21:30.689
Yeah, adobo.

21:30.689 --> 21:32.358
All right, let's set up
for the driving scene.

21:32.358 --> 21:33.159
Come on, sis.

21:34.493 --> 21:36.061
Action.

21:36.061 --> 21:39.465
I'm just a plain old
hetero-normative girl,

21:39.465 --> 21:42.034
but all of my best friends
have been drag queens.

21:47.573 --> 21:49.308
Cut.

21:49.308 --> 21:50.543
I want more out of
that laugh from you.

21:50.543 --> 21:53.546
-More?
-I like how it built. Yeah.

21:53.546 --> 21:56.582
But all of my best friends
have been drag queens.

22:03.389 --> 22:06.258
Great.

22:06.258 --> 22:08.060
-Thank you.
-Moving on.

22:08.060 --> 22:11.564
Oh, my God, Dad,
why are you wearing a wig?

22:11.564 --> 22:14.300
You're embarrassing me.

22:14.300 --> 22:16.268
Hello, hello, hello,
Christine.

22:16.268 --> 22:19.071
I'm not a regular dad.
I'm a cool dad.

22:19.071 --> 22:21.740
Vanjie, right now it's just
coming across like you.

22:21.740 --> 22:23.309
So I wonder if there's a way

22:23.309 --> 22:25.277
to find a little more
dorky dad in there.

22:25.277 --> 22:27.546
Hello, hello, hello.

22:27.546 --> 22:29.248
I can try dorky.
Let's do dorky.

22:29.248 --> 22:31.650
-Action.
-Hello, hello, hello.

22:31.650 --> 22:33.519
Hi, Christine.

22:33.519 --> 22:35.054
I'm a regular dad.

22:35.054 --> 22:38.023
I'm not a regular dad.
I'm cool.

22:38.023 --> 22:39.758
And I've been to DragCon
three times.

22:39.758 --> 22:41.160
Okur-ka-ka-ka-kurrr?

22:41.160 --> 22:42.761
Wait. Vanjie, do me a favor.

22:42.761 --> 22:44.330
I love the energy, but
it's a little Cookie Monster,

22:44.330 --> 22:45.364
and the crumbs are everywhere.

22:45.364 --> 22:46.632
Soften it a little bit.

22:46.632 --> 22:49.101
-Duly noted.
-And action.

22:49.101 --> 22:51.237
Hello, hello, hello, Christine.

22:51.237 --> 22:52.605
What the fuck?

22:55.674 --> 22:57.810
Okay, let's go back
to Cookie Monster.

22:57.810 --> 22:59.712
-I like the other one.
-Go back to Cookie Monster.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.680
Let's move on
to the next scene.

23:01.680 --> 23:03.249
And action.

23:03.249 --> 23:07.720
Upulence.
You own everything.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.455
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.

23:09.455 --> 23:11.357
Mercedes, opulence.

23:11.357 --> 23:12.358
Make sure we hear that, okay?

23:12.358 --> 23:13.359
Upulence.

23:13.359 --> 23:14.760
And action.

23:14.760 --> 23:19.398
Upulence,
you earn everything.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.667
Opulence,
you own everything.

23:21.667 --> 23:23.469
Action.

23:23.469 --> 23:27.406
Upulence, you earned--

23:27.406 --> 23:29.608
Own. You own.

23:29.608 --> 23:31.577
-You own it.
-Own.

23:31.577 --> 23:35.214
Opulence is like you're so
ridiculously opulent and rich

23:35.214 --> 23:36.682
that you can buy
whatever you want.

23:36.682 --> 23:38.284
So you own everything.
It's yours.

23:38.284 --> 23:39.385
Own.

23:39.385 --> 23:41.320
Don't forget,
you own everything.

23:41.320 --> 23:43.255
-You own.
-You own. Here we go.

23:43.255 --> 23:48.560
Upulence,
you own everything.

23:48.560 --> 23:50.429
Touch this skin.

23:50.429 --> 23:56.302
It's still just like opulence,
you have everything.

23:56.302 --> 23:59.805
And Kahanna is trying to do,
you know,

23:59.805 --> 24:02.341
what it is that's over the top,

24:02.341 --> 24:05.711
but it just still looks
like a flapping duck.

24:05.711 --> 24:07.112
Let's set up
for the last scene.

24:07.112 --> 24:08.447
Okay, this is it.

24:08.447 --> 24:09.481
Action.

24:09.481 --> 24:11.984
Girl, you haven't
realized by now

24:11.984 --> 24:14.486
this entire movie is a metaphor

24:14.486 --> 24:20.192
on...mainstream society's...
appropriation

24:20.192 --> 24:22.428
for the drag queen culture.

24:22.428 --> 24:24.363
Real quickly, Silky,
give me your line one more time.

24:24.363 --> 24:26.699
You haven't realize this
by now...

24:26.699 --> 24:28.133
That?

24:28.133 --> 24:31.637
That this entire movie is...

24:31.637 --> 24:33.105
Metaphor.

24:33.105 --> 24:34.640
-Oh, that this entire.
Right.

24:34.640 --> 24:38.277
-Go, go.
-This entire movie is based on--

24:38.277 --> 24:40.379
A metaphor.
Not based on true anything.

24:40.379 --> 24:42.014
Just bullshit society.

24:42.014 --> 24:44.149
This entire movie
is based on--

24:44.149 --> 24:45.351
Metaphor.

24:45.351 --> 24:47.519
Have you not
realized this by now

24:47.519 --> 24:51.023
that this entire movie
is a metaphor

24:51.023 --> 24:54.226
on the mainstream society's

24:54.226 --> 24:56.695
appropriated
a drag queen culture?

24:56.695 --> 24:58.097
Stay in the moment.

24:58.097 --> 24:58.764
Look at them.
Look at them.

24:58.764 --> 25:00.232
[flick]

25:00.232 --> 25:02.701
Step away from the mother
clucking drag queen.

25:04.136 --> 25:06.105
That fan won't stop us.

25:06.105 --> 25:08.040
Silky, that's you.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.641
That fan ain't gonna do shit.

25:09.641 --> 25:12.244
No, but my
DMV-issued taser will.

25:15.080 --> 25:16.348
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Listen.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.751
Silky, you can't laugh, girl.

25:18.751 --> 25:20.652
This is like Fight Club.

25:20.652 --> 25:22.454
Guys, I don't want
to do this anymore, please.

25:22.454 --> 25:23.655
Wrap it up.

25:23.655 --> 25:25.457
Stop laughing, you're dead.

25:25.457 --> 25:27.659
Great. Tase her titties.
Good.

25:27.659 --> 25:28.660
-Well put.
-Thank you.

25:28.660 --> 25:30.329
Luckily my character

25:30.329 --> 25:32.097
is supposed to be concerned
and confused,

25:32.097 --> 25:33.999
because I'm both
of those things.

25:33.999 --> 25:35.601
Okay, this is the last take.

25:35.601 --> 25:37.302
And action.

25:37.302 --> 25:39.505
Oh, you a big bitch.
I gotta get you twice.

25:41.206 --> 25:43.776
And that's a wrap.

25:43.776 --> 25:46.044
That was quite a journey.

25:46.044 --> 25:47.479
That means this could go
either way, y'all.

25:47.479 --> 25:50.015
Oh, God.

25:50.015 --> 25:51.483
I think we're in trouble.

25:51.483 --> 25:52.718
Thank you.

25:52.718 --> 25:54.186
I hope the other team did bad.

25:58.223 --> 25:59.625
You better come through, girl.

25:59.625 --> 26:02.661
Let's get this party started.

26:02.661 --> 26:05.697
It's elimination day,
and I'm feeling very confident.

26:05.697 --> 26:07.399
So this is going to be

26:07.399 --> 26:10.836
a nice either validation
or wakeup call.

26:15.007 --> 26:16.041
Girl, what are you doing?

26:16.041 --> 26:18.377
I'm trying
something different.

26:18.377 --> 26:19.445
-Girl, you look like--
-I'm about to go contour

26:19.445 --> 26:21.513
with blue and turquoises
and all of that,

26:21.513 --> 26:23.449
then put like a gold forehead.

26:23.449 --> 26:26.051
Oh, 'cause, girl, I'm over here
confused as hell.

26:26.051 --> 26:28.253
I'm confused, too,
until I get it together, bitch.

26:28.253 --> 26:29.988
That's why I said
I need all this time.

26:29.988 --> 26:31.824
♪ Oh, give me
some chicken wings ♪

26:34.193 --> 26:36.028
How do you feel about
what Ru brought up,

26:36.028 --> 26:38.197
you know, with the other girls
talking about

26:38.197 --> 26:40.332
how loud and rambunctious
you are?

26:40.332 --> 26:42.201
[Silky] I'm gonna let
y'all bitches know,

26:42.201 --> 26:44.036
I'm gonna be here,
I'm gonna be loud as hell.

26:44.036 --> 26:45.037
Fuck you all.

26:45.037 --> 26:46.605
[all laugh]

26:46.605 --> 26:49.575
I'm ready to figure out
who said that shit

26:49.575 --> 26:51.310
to come forward.

26:51.310 --> 26:52.778
Brooke Lynn, I got a question
for your team, bitch.

26:52.778 --> 26:54.246
[Brooke Lynn] Go.

26:54.246 --> 26:56.348
[Silky]
So which one of you bitches

26:56.348 --> 26:57.549
was the one
that said it about me?

26:58.784 --> 27:00.385
Y'all legit.

27:00.385 --> 27:02.554
Because everyone's
being quiet about it.

27:02.554 --> 27:04.089
-Right.
-Said what?

27:04.089 --> 27:05.557
Was the one who threw her name
out to fucking Ru.

27:05.557 --> 27:08.026
I did.

27:08.026 --> 27:09.428
I knew it was you, bitch.

27:09.428 --> 27:11.063
I'm not gonna lie to you.

27:11.063 --> 27:12.731
[Yvie] No, it's just
everybody else on your team

27:12.731 --> 27:13.999
was being all cute
and quiet about it.

27:13.999 --> 27:15.534
But why would you say that
about me?

27:15.534 --> 27:17.536
You know, I'm feeling
a little bit overwhelmed,

27:17.536 --> 27:19.438
because I'm the only one
that admitted it.

27:19.438 --> 27:22.207
Anybody else, like,
y'all said shit, too,

27:22.207 --> 27:25.244
but, okay, let me be--
let me be the villain.

27:25.244 --> 27:26.144
The way it came off
was just like

27:26.144 --> 27:28.547
I'm a loud, obnoxious person,

27:28.547 --> 27:31.183
and I'm not gonna allow
my team to speak.

27:31.183 --> 27:33.185
You do have a big personality,
and you know that.

27:33.185 --> 27:34.353
I do.

27:34.353 --> 27:35.754
And I'm saying
I was curious to see

27:35.754 --> 27:37.222
how that was going to mix
in a teamwork environment.

27:37.222 --> 27:38.991
That's--that's it.

27:38.991 --> 27:40.592
That's the Tee. Thank
you for speaking up, Ariel.

27:40.592 --> 27:42.761
The rest of y'all need
to step your pussies up.

27:42.761 --> 27:44.363
No, but I think we all agreed.

27:44.363 --> 27:45.631
Whether or not you agreed--

27:45.631 --> 27:47.165
if you agreed then
fucking speak up about it.

27:47.165 --> 27:49.268
If you have enough balls
to tell Ru,

27:49.268 --> 27:51.203
then tell Silky
to her goddamn face.

27:51.203 --> 27:53.405
Hey, so, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

27:53.405 --> 27:56.074
I'm not liking
this energy at all.

27:56.074 --> 27:57.776
Instead of asking
everybody else

27:57.776 --> 27:59.578
and then going off
about this shit

27:59.578 --> 28:00.512
that you know nothing about.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.014
-Uh-huh.
-Bitch, like--

28:02.014 --> 28:03.315
It's not that I don't know
nothing about it.

28:03.315 --> 28:05.150
I've heard it from
half of y'all anyways, so...

28:05.150 --> 28:09.221
I am shook that Yvie
has come for me.

28:09.221 --> 28:12.424
She messing with
the absolute wrong bitch.

28:12.424 --> 28:14.192
The bitch in the room
that you don't mess with

28:14.192 --> 28:15.627
and don't fuck with is me.

28:15.627 --> 28:17.162
Put that shit on ice.

28:17.162 --> 28:19.231
Girl, you better
your own self on ice.

28:19.231 --> 28:21.066
Better focus on
this goddamn challenge.

28:21.066 --> 28:22.601
Oh, I'm focused, boo.

28:22.601 --> 28:24.269
Your makeup says otherwise.

28:24.269 --> 28:26.572
Ooh. Girl.

28:26.572 --> 28:31.577
Not only does she attack me,
she attacks my makeup.

28:31.577 --> 28:33.212
Now, bitch.

28:33.212 --> 28:35.080
Girl, Miss Yvie,
look at yourself and then ask--

28:35.080 --> 28:37.015
say whose makeup is doing what?

28:37.015 --> 28:38.450
Right, you need to focus.

28:38.450 --> 28:40.085
Bitch, you are
sitting over there

28:40.085 --> 28:42.187
rubbing gray paint on your face.

28:42.187 --> 28:45.290
Uh, have you ever seen somebody
finger-paint with their feet?

28:45.290 --> 28:47.392
That's Yvie's mug.

28:47.392 --> 28:49.027
Focus on that blending, boo.

28:49.027 --> 28:50.028
Bitch, I don't know
you're talking about.

28:50.028 --> 28:51.029
Focus on that blending.

28:51.029 --> 28:52.030
She's a goddess.

28:52.030 --> 28:53.432
No, bitch, you can never.

28:53.432 --> 28:55.767
A girl that looks like you,
smells like you,

28:55.767 --> 28:58.270
acts like you, no, ma'am.

28:58.270 --> 29:00.005
An ugly girl can never come
for a pretty girl.

29:00.005 --> 29:03.041
No, it's an ugly bitch like you

29:03.041 --> 29:05.510
crawling out of the swamp
to come for me?

29:05.510 --> 29:06.678
Mm-mm, girl, I'm over it.

29:08.413 --> 29:10.082
Bitch, I gotta go
put on a beauty mug.

29:10.082 --> 29:11.316
I don't know what the fuck
I was thinking.

29:13.952 --> 29:15.554
I don't know what
you were thinking. Fuck.

29:15.554 --> 29:18.624
Whatever it was
definitely ain't working.

29:23.261 --> 29:25.364
So who all has traveled
for pageants?

29:25.364 --> 29:27.032
I've traveled a lot
for pageantry.

29:27.032 --> 29:28.634
I did a pageant in Memphis.

29:28.634 --> 29:30.502
I did pageants in Nashville.

29:30.502 --> 29:33.605
I did pageants
in Mississippi.

29:33.605 --> 29:35.240
I used to travel a lot.

29:35.240 --> 29:37.743
It was just like
so hard for me to fly

29:37.743 --> 29:41.713
that I ended up like I used to
drive state to state for shows.

29:41.713 --> 29:43.582
You know what my problem was?

29:43.582 --> 29:45.317
Why they put me
on a no-flight list?

29:45.317 --> 29:47.986
Like, girl, I couldn't fly.

29:47.986 --> 29:49.221
You're on the no-fly list?

29:49.221 --> 29:51.990
I used to be
for the longest time.

29:51.990 --> 29:52.991
Bitch, are you kidding me?

29:52.991 --> 29:54.993
-Seriously.
-Why?

29:54.993 --> 29:56.228
My name, and you know,

29:56.228 --> 29:58.363
especially what's going on
now these days.

29:58.363 --> 30:02.267
Oh, you mean some cute, casual,
societally built-in racism?

30:02.267 --> 30:05.137
I'm originally
from Mombasa, Kenya,

30:05.137 --> 30:07.606
and my name sounds Muslim,

30:07.606 --> 30:10.342
so they put me
on the watch list.

30:10.342 --> 30:13.011
And I was like,
I'm a drag queen.

30:13.011 --> 30:15.180
Like, what you think
I'm gonna do?

30:15.180 --> 30:17.482
It was just--it was just
so hard getting--

30:17.482 --> 30:20.318
On top of that, my body
gave out one time, girl--

30:20.318 --> 30:21.720
Your body gave out?

30:21.720 --> 30:24.623
Yeah, girl, like, not getting
enough rest and stuff.

30:24.623 --> 30:27.159
Bitch, I had a stroke
in the middle of a pageant.

30:27.159 --> 30:28.660
What?

30:28.660 --> 30:30.128
And then I ended up
being in a wheelchair.

30:30.128 --> 30:31.530
Like, I had to take off
from shows.

30:31.530 --> 30:32.531
Oh, girl, now
I ain't know it was that bad.

30:32.531 --> 30:34.566
Like, I couldn't walk.

30:34.566 --> 30:37.335
Because I couldn't fly,
I was on the road all the time,

30:37.335 --> 30:39.438
and so my body
couldn't take it anymore.

30:39.438 --> 30:41.039
I was in a wheelchair.

30:41.039 --> 30:43.375
I lost the whole feeling
on my right side.

30:43.375 --> 30:46.745
It was scary.

30:46.745 --> 30:48.980
I had to hide from social media.

30:48.980 --> 30:51.650
I didn't want people
to see me in public, like...

30:55.620 --> 30:59.357
It was just like
literally so hard.

30:59.357 --> 31:02.394
I was like, what did I do,
like, you know?

31:04.062 --> 31:08.233
Being an immigrant
in the U.S. is hard.

31:08.233 --> 31:10.669
It's really, really hard.

31:10.669 --> 31:14.406
I cannot believe
that we have a man in office

31:14.406 --> 31:17.442
who thinks that it's okay
to try and block out more people

31:17.442 --> 31:18.810
who bring more culture
to this place.

31:20.545 --> 31:23.381
All right, now let's start
talking about our cysts.

31:24.583 --> 31:26.184
Bring cyst back.

31:26.184 --> 31:29.755
Bring back my cyster.

31:29.755 --> 31:32.057
Oh, my God.

31:32.057 --> 31:33.358
I don't know what this is.
I popped it.

31:45.337 --> 31:48.774
♪ Cover girl,
put the bass in your walk ♪

31:48.774 --> 31:52.778
♪ Head to toe,

31:52.778 --> 31:55.280
And what?

31:55.280 --> 31:58.650
Welcome to the main stage
of RuPaul's Drag Race.

31:58.650 --> 32:02.120
Now in 3D,
it's Michelle Visage.

32:02.120 --> 32:04.523
Now, what was it like
directing two films?

32:04.523 --> 32:07.993
Well, Ru, you know I'm known
for my double features.

32:07.993 --> 32:08.894
Who do you use as a DP?

32:10.328 --> 32:13.999
Our fabulous co-director
Ross Mathews.

32:13.999 --> 32:15.333
I loved directing, Ru.

32:15.333 --> 32:16.968
I felt like a regular
Alfred Bitchcock.

32:19.471 --> 32:21.773
The hilarious Bobby Moynihan.

32:21.773 --> 32:23.408
Now, have you done drag before?

32:23.408 --> 32:25.310
I haven't, but I do have
a drag name.

32:25.310 --> 32:26.511
Might be a little un-PC,

32:26.511 --> 32:28.346
but I think I would go
with Fatti LuPone.

32:28.346 --> 32:31.116
Fatti LuPone, oh, my God.

32:31.116 --> 32:31.783
Either Fatti LuPone
or Better Midler.

32:34.619 --> 32:37.155
From Glow and Black Panther,
Sydelle Noel.

32:37.155 --> 32:39.591
Dragkanda forever, Ru.

32:39.591 --> 32:41.126
Don't you mean whomp-whomp?

32:43.195 --> 32:45.063
This week we challenged
our queens

32:45.063 --> 32:49.067
to over-act in two
breakthrough feature films.

32:49.067 --> 32:51.703
And on the runway,
category is

32:51.703 --> 32:53.171
What's Your Sign?

32:53.171 --> 32:56.107
Gentlemen, start your engines,

32:56.107 --> 32:58.109
and may the best woman win.

32:59.778 --> 33:02.180
♪ We got a mighty love ♪

33:02.180 --> 33:05.116
Category is What's Your Sign?

33:05.116 --> 33:08.486
First up,
Brooke Lynn Hytes, Pisces.

33:08.486 --> 33:10.655
This makes me
wanna rent Splash.

33:10.655 --> 33:12.624
Oh, my cod.

33:12.624 --> 33:15.093
I may not be feeling confident
about the challenge,

33:15.093 --> 33:16.628
but I feel really confident
in my runway.

33:16.628 --> 33:19.264
I have two koi fish
swimming across my chest,

33:19.264 --> 33:22.067
and this giant neckpiece
that's all water.

33:22.067 --> 33:23.168
It's really uncomfortable
to be in,

33:23.168 --> 33:25.036
but I look fucking good.

33:25.036 --> 33:26.571
She's totally shellfish.

33:28.273 --> 33:31.243
Plastique Tiara, Aries.

33:31.243 --> 33:33.478
I love that she
just kept her knees hairy.

33:33.478 --> 33:35.113
People don't do that anymore.

33:35.113 --> 33:36.615
-We don't.
-No, they don't.

33:36.615 --> 33:38.483
Last time I gave them
just a pretty runway,

33:38.483 --> 33:41.786
but this time I decided
to go sexy, seductive.

33:41.786 --> 33:44.756
I look the best.
I smell the best.

33:44.756 --> 33:46.558
This is my runway.

33:46.558 --> 33:48.093
This is the hostess
at every restaurant

33:48.093 --> 33:50.395
-in Game of Thrones.
-Yes.

33:50.395 --> 33:52.330
Today, mutton.
Tomorrow, muttoned.

33:54.065 --> 33:57.369
Ra'Jah O'Hara, Capricorn.

33:57.369 --> 33:58.770
Capricorn is a what?
It's a ram?

33:58.770 --> 34:00.272
It's a ram poodle.

34:00.272 --> 34:02.340
Capricorn sign

34:02.340 --> 34:04.476
is a mixture
of a goat and a fish.

34:04.476 --> 34:06.745
The mug was right,
the hair was tight.

34:06.745 --> 34:08.446
Goats are very agile,

34:08.446 --> 34:10.448
and that's very much
my personality.

34:10.448 --> 34:12.217
I thrive in rough terrain.

34:12.217 --> 34:14.753
I believe that's
a Jean-Paul Goat-ier.

34:14.753 --> 34:16.621
Oh, no, you didn't.

34:16.621 --> 34:19.057
Goated it.

34:19.057 --> 34:21.726
Nina West, Leo.

34:21.726 --> 34:23.662
Her fire's on pussy.

34:25.563 --> 34:27.465
I decided
to really be inspired

34:27.465 --> 34:29.200
by the mane of a lion

34:29.200 --> 34:32.537
and show the judges that
I am this fiery competitor.

34:32.537 --> 34:34.572
As a lion, I've killed before,
and I will kill again.

34:36.274 --> 34:38.276
Stop re-lion
on that body.

34:40.178 --> 34:43.081
Honey Davenport, Leo.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.083
I've heard of a brown noser,
but this is ridiculous.

34:46.685 --> 34:49.120
I'm serving it
like as if Diana Ross

34:49.120 --> 34:51.089
was the lion in The Wiz.

34:51.089 --> 34:56.061
You can see every inch of this
fully rhinestoned lion goddess.

34:56.061 --> 34:58.763
Brings a whole
new meaning to the mane stage.

34:58.763 --> 35:00.565
The lion sleeps around.

35:02.567 --> 35:04.569
Shuga Cain, "Scorpico."

35:04.569 --> 35:07.639
That girl is poison.

35:07.639 --> 35:09.641
This outfit is all me,

35:09.641 --> 35:11.609
because I want to serve body,
I want it like tight,

35:11.609 --> 35:13.111
I want to feel that sexy vibe.

35:13.111 --> 35:14.579
I'm a little dark
and mysterious

35:14.579 --> 35:15.614
and a little scary.

35:15.614 --> 35:17.349
You better watch out.

35:17.349 --> 35:19.451
Now we know
where Jane Child went.

35:21.019 --> 35:21.953
Thank you.
It's a nineties reference.

35:23.621 --> 35:26.625
Ariel Versace, Aries.

35:26.625 --> 35:29.494
She's the purple sheep
of the family.

35:29.494 --> 35:32.130
A unicorn and a ram
walk into a bar

35:32.130 --> 35:33.598
and the rest is history.

35:33.598 --> 35:36.434
I'm an Aries, so I'm loud,
obnoxious, and crazy.

35:36.434 --> 35:38.403
My runway looks
are always going to be fun,

35:38.403 --> 35:39.704
over the top,
and definitely me.

35:39.704 --> 35:41.439
I'm living.

35:41.439 --> 35:45.510
Ewe better werk.
E-W-E--

35:45.510 --> 35:47.545
-You write it out, yeah.
-Write it down.

35:47.545 --> 35:51.182
When you get home,
you're going to laugh.

35:51.182 --> 35:54.686
Silky Nutmeg Ganache,
Capricorn.

35:54.686 --> 35:56.421
I call this
my goat of many colors.

35:58.123 --> 36:01.559
I'm giving you
deep-fried catfish

36:01.559 --> 36:04.696
with a side of potato salad,
baked beans,

36:04.696 --> 36:07.232
and a tall glass of sweet tea.

36:07.232 --> 36:09.100
That's what I'm serving
on the runway today, baby.

36:09.100 --> 36:10.535
I am just simply in love.

36:10.535 --> 36:12.570
I don't think
you're yeti for this jelly.

36:12.570 --> 36:14.672
-Uh-uh.
-Definitely not.

36:14.672 --> 36:16.174
Capri-corn?

36:16.174 --> 36:17.308
I don't remember
having Capri-corn.

36:18.576 --> 36:20.645
Yvie Oddly, Leo.

36:20.645 --> 36:23.715
Rum Tum Tugger,
the early years.

36:23.715 --> 36:27.719
My look is this digital
lion quintessential Yvie.

36:27.719 --> 36:29.621
I'm showing
an attention to detail

36:29.621 --> 36:31.322
with all my little bits
and gadgets

36:31.322 --> 36:34.325
and broken pieces of computers.

36:34.325 --> 36:35.727
This lion
is my digital fantasy.

36:35.727 --> 36:37.328
I did not know
they were filming Avatar.

36:38.763 --> 36:40.565
Her litter box is filthy.

36:42.400 --> 36:44.736
Beep, beep, beep.

36:44.736 --> 36:48.039
Vanessa Vanjie Mateo,
Libra.

36:48.039 --> 36:50.041
Now this is a balanced look.

36:50.041 --> 36:51.042
Hey, Vanjie,
how's it hanging?

36:51.042 --> 36:52.343
Well hung.

36:52.343 --> 36:54.679
I'm giving you
flower girl realness.

36:54.679 --> 36:58.216
I gotta balance these fucking
red roses on my head.

36:58.216 --> 36:59.517
I hot glued that bitch.

36:59.517 --> 37:02.187
Ooh, my God,
I can feel the pain,

37:02.187 --> 37:03.521
but, baby,
that's what you have to do.

37:03.521 --> 37:04.622
She has rosen.

37:06.658 --> 37:11.362
A'Keria C. Davenport,
Pisces.

37:11.362 --> 37:13.932
On a scale of one to five,
I give this an Omega 3.

37:15.266 --> 37:17.535
Clearly I'm a fish.

37:17.535 --> 37:19.404
My body is still
a little claustrophobic.

37:19.404 --> 37:21.506
I'm usually about showing
my body-ody.

37:21.506 --> 37:23.074
I just wanted
to show the judges

37:23.074 --> 37:25.443
that, you know, she's not
always that sex kitten.

37:25.443 --> 37:27.612
She can give you variety.

37:27.612 --> 37:29.981
She's all about that bass,
about that bass.

37:29.981 --> 37:31.216
Fish, fish, fish.

37:33.017 --> 37:36.321
Mercedes Iman Diamond.

37:36.321 --> 37:38.156
She really knows
how to handle her weapon.

37:38.156 --> 37:40.225
Shoot that poison arrow.

37:40.225 --> 37:42.127
Girl, I'm gonna show you

37:42.127 --> 37:44.362
how Mercedes owns this stage.

37:44.362 --> 37:47.499
I am giving you this big hair.

37:47.499 --> 37:50.168
And, bitch, I'm from the
jungles, don't forget that.

37:50.168 --> 37:51.169
She does make a point.

37:51.169 --> 37:52.370
Duck, Michelle, duck.

37:54.172 --> 37:56.508
Kahanna Montrese, Aries.

37:56.508 --> 37:58.343
Ram tough.

37:58.343 --> 38:00.245
Yes, she is.

38:00.245 --> 38:01.679
I'm really trying
to channel Tyra Banks,

38:01.679 --> 38:04.015
because I'm feeling
like top model fish.

38:04.015 --> 38:06.084
I am moving this chiffon
around the stage.

38:07.986 --> 38:10.488
Okay. Well, bitch,
there goes that moment.

38:10.488 --> 38:12.724
Wham, bam, thank you, ram.

38:15.627 --> 38:17.996
Scarlet Envy, Pisces.

38:17.996 --> 38:19.998
I hate to burst your bubble,

38:19.998 --> 38:21.699
but you're blowing it.

38:21.699 --> 38:23.334
I don't remember
Frozen being like this.

38:25.336 --> 38:29.073
I am a Pieces goddess
directly from the sea,

38:29.073 --> 38:31.376
right into your heart.

38:31.376 --> 38:36.314
She is giving you waves
of fluid, beautiful glitter.

38:36.314 --> 38:37.649
Call me bubbles, darling.

38:37.649 --> 38:38.516
Everybody does.

38:40.084 --> 38:41.553
In honor of Michael Jackson.

38:41.553 --> 38:42.921
-Bubbles.
-Bubbles.

38:45.056 --> 38:47.225
It's time
for Team Brooke Lynn Hytes

38:47.225 --> 38:49.360
and the global premiere

38:49.360 --> 38:51.963
of Why It Gotta Be Black,
Panther?

38:55.366 --> 38:58.269
Nails, I just got
my DNA test results,

38:58.269 --> 39:02.407
and, bitch, I'm 50%
Dragkanda royalty,

39:02.407 --> 39:04.576
and I didn't even know
that was a real place.

39:04.576 --> 39:06.077
Oh, honey.

39:06.077 --> 39:08.246
Dragkanda
is this mystical place

39:08.246 --> 39:10.114
where drag queens run free.

39:10.114 --> 39:11.950
But how do we get there?

39:11.950 --> 39:12.951
I know a way.

39:12.951 --> 39:14.385
And when we get inside,

39:14.385 --> 39:17.121
you can take
the rightful place as queen,

39:17.121 --> 39:19.090
and I will become rich.

39:19.090 --> 39:20.625
Rich, I say!

39:23.161 --> 39:24.662
-Next hand.
-Bitch!

39:24.662 --> 39:26.164
You know I only got one hand,

39:26.164 --> 39:27.565
and I'll cut you with it!

39:31.603 --> 39:34.606
Deep within the dunes
of Fire Island

39:34.606 --> 39:36.107
lies the world's

39:36.107 --> 39:40.378
most technologically advanced
civilization: Dragkanda.

39:40.378 --> 39:44.515
Powered by charismium,
this great drag nation is ruled

39:44.515 --> 39:48.987
by my drag daughter,
the whitest Black Panther.

39:48.987 --> 39:51.489
Excuse me,
but we can't say Black Panther.

39:51.489 --> 39:53.024
Copyright issue.

39:53.024 --> 39:56.094
How about Pink Panther?

39:56.094 --> 39:57.195
-Oh, my God, I love pink.
-No, try again.

39:57.195 --> 39:59.030
Purple Panther?

39:59.030 --> 40:01.065
Yes! I love the color purple.

40:01.065 --> 40:03.034
Oprah was right.

40:03.034 --> 40:05.303
Listen.
Enemy forces are coming

40:05.303 --> 40:08.339
to threaten the...
Purple Panther.

40:08.339 --> 40:09.474
Oh, my God.

40:09.474 --> 40:11.509
And undermine
our drag way of life.

40:11.509 --> 40:13.645
BeBe Zaharaaaah!

40:13.645 --> 40:16.681
Ra-ka-ta-titi-ta-ta.

40:16.681 --> 40:17.782
Wrong movie, ma'am.

40:19.384 --> 40:22.120
To harness your pussy power,

40:22.120 --> 40:25.056
you must smoke this mystical
charismium flower.

40:27.091 --> 40:27.859
Exhale, baby, exhale.

40:33.431 --> 40:36.567
What?
It's legal in Dragkanda.

40:41.105 --> 40:44.042
Oh, my God, Great Aunt Max'ine,
is that you?

40:44.042 --> 40:46.544
There is a rival panther
coming for your crown.

40:46.544 --> 40:48.980
Beyoncé what?

40:48.980 --> 40:53.351
You have a half-drag sister,
and, bitch, she is from Chicago.

40:53.351 --> 40:56.654
I don't start drama,
but I definitely finish it.

40:56.654 --> 41:01.592
You need to get some gadgets
from your sister Sissy, honey.

41:01.592 --> 41:04.829
If you stay woke,
you won't have to get woke.

41:06.331 --> 41:10.601
Whoo-hoo! Damn,
that is some good shit.

41:14.138 --> 41:16.407
Sissy, our half-sister
Chicago Panther

41:16.407 --> 41:18.710
is coming to try
to snatch my crown.

41:18.710 --> 41:20.011
I need your help.

41:20.011 --> 41:22.280
Chicago Panther?

41:22.280 --> 41:23.781
Oh, I follow her on Instagram.

41:23.781 --> 41:27.452
Clearly she got
the looks in the family.

41:27.452 --> 41:28.753
Can we move on?

41:28.753 --> 41:31.356
These killer heels,

41:31.356 --> 41:33.491
well, girl,
they will make your booty pop.

41:33.491 --> 41:35.660
Absolutely not.

41:35.660 --> 41:37.328
Now here they are.

41:37.328 --> 41:40.631
These tactical tucking panties.

41:40.631 --> 41:45.103
These have the ability to absorb
even the strongest of shade,

41:45.103 --> 41:50.041
and then clapback with
the intensity of 10.000 reads!

41:50.041 --> 41:50.908
Yes!

41:54.579 --> 41:57.548
Chicago Panther and Nails
have breached the panty shields.

41:57.548 --> 41:58.516
I think they're coming.

42:00.718 --> 42:04.655
Not only am I the legitimate
heir to the throne of Dragkanda,

42:04.655 --> 42:06.657
I'm also legitimately hotter.

42:06.657 --> 42:08.426
Everybody says so.

42:08.426 --> 42:10.194
Right, Nails?

42:10.194 --> 42:12.130
Whatever you say, Chicago.

42:12.130 --> 42:14.499
But now I can get my hands--

42:14.499 --> 42:19.203
I mean, hand, on
the all-powerful charisminum.

42:19.203 --> 42:23.074
Hey, Nails.
You ready to lose another arm?

42:23.074 --> 42:26.577
Oh, honey, I can fight you with
one hand tied behind my back.

42:26.577 --> 42:30.481
Now give me the charisminum
or feel my wrath.

42:30.481 --> 42:35.520
We will fight you to the death
Dragkanda style.

42:37.155 --> 42:39.457
Purple Panther, you're so ugly

42:39.457 --> 42:41.726
your family had to tie
a pork chop around your neck

42:41.726 --> 42:42.794
for the dog to play with you.

42:42.794 --> 42:44.295
Ho, is you a squirrel?

42:44.295 --> 42:47.632
Because your cheeks
are full of nuts.

42:47.632 --> 42:50.034
Your shade is just
too intense for me.

42:54.539 --> 42:57.275
How come I ain't got
no dialogue in this scene?

42:57.275 --> 42:59.510
Reclaiming my lines.

42:59.510 --> 43:01.446
Reclaiming my lines.

43:07.151 --> 43:11.689
Next up,
Team Silky Nutmeg Ganache

43:11.689 --> 43:16.027
and the global premiere
of Good God Girl, Get Out!

43:19.197 --> 43:20.765
Marnie, we're driving

43:20.765 --> 43:24.502
all the way to your
heterosexual parents' house.

43:24.502 --> 43:27.205
But do they know
I'm a drag queen?

43:27.205 --> 43:29.674
Oh, Christine,
they're gonna love you.

43:29.674 --> 43:31.642
They love me, don't they?

43:31.642 --> 43:34.312
Yeah, but you're definitely
not a drag queen.

43:34.312 --> 43:35.546
I know.

43:35.546 --> 43:38.449
I'm just a plain old
hetero-normative girl.

43:38.449 --> 43:40.818
But all of my best friends
have been drag queens.

43:49.193 --> 43:51.129
Was that--

43:51.129 --> 43:54.332
An eerie foreshadowing
of something to come?

43:54.332 --> 43:58.035
No, I think
that was Derrick Barry.

43:58.035 --> 44:00.671
Good God, girl, get--

44:09.680 --> 44:11.182
Hello, hello, hello,
Christine.

44:11.182 --> 44:13.551
I'm no regular dad.
I'm a cool dad.

44:13.551 --> 44:15.219
I watch Drag Race every night

44:15.219 --> 44:17.188
and I've been to DragCon
three times.

44:17.188 --> 44:18.623
Okurr-ka-ka-ka-kurrr?

44:18.623 --> 44:20.324
As a psychologist,

44:20.324 --> 44:23.060
I found that Vivian
Mahogany Davenport's

44:23.060 --> 44:24.595
new panel discussion

44:24.595 --> 44:27.298
on the new movement
of soft sculpture

44:27.298 --> 44:29.467
is truly fascinating.

44:29.467 --> 44:32.670
Oh, I'm sorry my parents
are being so weird.

44:32.670 --> 44:37.408
They're definitely not trying
to plot something bad.

44:37.408 --> 44:40.278
What? No, I don't think
anything's weird.

44:42.079 --> 44:44.015
Upulence!

44:44.015 --> 44:46.684
You own everything.

44:46.684 --> 44:48.486
Touch this skin.

44:48.486 --> 44:51.822
Touch all this skin, bro.

44:53.457 --> 44:56.427
Okay, that was weird.

44:56.427 --> 44:59.697
Oh, no, they're the drag queens
who work for us.

44:59.697 --> 45:04.235
And they're definitely
not my grandparents.

45:04.235 --> 45:06.571
♪ Guess who's back
in the house? ♪

45:06.571 --> 45:08.506
♪ Guess who's back
in the house? ♪

45:08.506 --> 45:10.608
New phone. Who's this?

45:10.608 --> 45:13.578
It's your best friend
Rhonda from the DMV.

45:13.578 --> 45:17.481
Excuse me, can't you see
I'm on my lunch break?

45:17.481 --> 45:19.650
So they haven't killed you yet?

45:19.650 --> 45:22.253
I think they like me.

45:22.253 --> 45:24.422
Don't you watch
scary movies?

45:24.422 --> 45:27.258
The drag queen is always
the first to be murdered.

45:27.258 --> 45:29.527
I'm pretty sure
it's the black guy.

45:29.527 --> 45:32.430
Oh, time for dinner, hon.

45:32.430 --> 45:34.332
Ready to be served?

45:34.332 --> 45:35.299
Who dat?

45:39.770 --> 45:41.072
Hi-ee.

45:44.041 --> 45:45.743
Leave while you still can.

45:45.743 --> 45:47.778
What did you say to her,
little girl?

45:47.778 --> 45:49.680
I'm so not a man.

45:49.680 --> 45:52.450
-Sashay away.
-What was that?

45:52.450 --> 45:54.585
I just asked her
if she would like some eggs.

45:54.585 --> 45:57.321
Oh, no, thank you.
I brought my own hot sauce.

45:57.321 --> 46:00.324
Good God, girl, get out!

46:00.324 --> 46:01.626
Hold that thought.

46:01.626 --> 46:03.427
I gotta get this.

46:03.427 --> 46:04.762
Who's this?

46:04.762 --> 46:08.666
Oh, thank God, girl,
they haven't killed you yet.

46:08.666 --> 46:10.301
Girl, listen.

46:10.301 --> 46:12.169
According to my DMV database,

46:12.169 --> 46:13.537
drag queens have been
coming up missing

46:13.537 --> 46:16.040
for the past 11 seasons.

46:16.040 --> 46:19.644
Like, falling off social media,
canceling gigs.

46:19.644 --> 46:22.680
Marnie's family is a part
of some secret society

46:22.680 --> 46:26.517
that kidnaps, brainwashes, and
trades places with drag queens.

46:26.517 --> 46:30.021
Like, Christine, like,
you in danger, girl.

46:30.021 --> 46:31.389
Time to go, Christine.

46:39.230 --> 46:41.432
Would you like some tea,
Christine?

46:41.432 --> 46:44.535
Oh, no, thank you.
I'm not thirsty.

46:44.535 --> 46:47.405
I've never met a queen
that didn't like tea.

46:47.405 --> 46:48.606
What's the tea?

46:48.606 --> 46:50.474
What's the tea?

46:50.474 --> 46:51.809
What's the Tee?

46:53.444 --> 46:55.446
Bitch, please--

46:55.446 --> 47:01.218
Now the time has come for you
to sink, sink, sink, sink.

47:01.218 --> 47:04.088
Now you're in
the between-me-down-there.

47:04.088 --> 47:06.090
That's how you say it, right?

47:06.090 --> 47:07.992
You're paralyzed, Christine.

47:07.992 --> 47:11.996
Like when Valentina didn't
know the words to Greedy.

47:13.698 --> 47:17.068
OMG! What's happening?

47:17.068 --> 47:20.271
Girl, you haven't realized
by now what's going on?

47:20.271 --> 47:23.107
This whole entire movie
is a metaphor

47:23.107 --> 47:27.344
on mainstream society's
appropriation of drag culture.

47:27.344 --> 47:32.683
Now I'm gonna put the snatch
in body-ody-ody snatcher.

47:32.683 --> 47:34.752
Wait!

47:34.752 --> 47:37.288
I recognize that sound.

47:37.288 --> 47:40.224
Step away from
the mother clucking drag queen.

47:40.224 --> 47:42.693
Oh, that fan
ain't gonna stop us.

47:42.693 --> 47:44.695
No, bitch,
but my DMV-issue taser will.

47:49.433 --> 47:51.168
Oh, you a big bitch.
I gotta get you twice.

47:53.637 --> 47:57.608
Yes, bitch!
But how did you know?

47:57.608 --> 48:00.311
At the DMV, oh, bitch,
we get shit done.

48:00.311 --> 48:04.115
Actually, you guys
don't really get anything done.

48:04.115 --> 48:06.317
Shut up, bitch.
Let's go.

48:06.317 --> 48:07.885
'Cause I'm still on
my motherfucking lunch break.

48:12.390 --> 48:15.092
Wow.

48:15.092 --> 48:18.028
Ladies,
I've made some decisions.

48:20.331 --> 48:23.234
When I call your name,
please step forward.

48:23.234 --> 48:24.034
Nina West.

48:25.703 --> 48:28.572
Vanessa Vanjie Mateo.

48:28.572 --> 48:31.642
Dr. Silky Nutmeg Ganache.

48:31.642 --> 48:33.344
Honey Davenport.

48:33.344 --> 48:36.680
A'Keria C. Davenport.

48:36.680 --> 48:39.483
Ra'Jah O'Hara.

48:39.483 --> 48:42.419
You are safe.

48:44.989 --> 48:47.258
You may leave the stage.

48:52.096 --> 48:54.598
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques,

48:54.598 --> 48:58.502
starting with Brooke Lynn Hytes.

48:58.502 --> 49:01.205
I love this outfit.
I think it's like one of my top.

49:01.205 --> 49:04.975
As far as your performance goes,
it was only one note.

49:04.975 --> 49:06.310
Oh, my God.

49:06.310 --> 49:08.045
So it kind of flatlined.

49:08.045 --> 49:10.614
I was actually on the set.
I was incog-Negro.

49:12.616 --> 49:14.185
Watching you guys,

49:14.185 --> 49:15.219
and one of the notes
that Michelle gave you

49:15.219 --> 49:18.289
was "Beyoncé what?" line.

49:18.289 --> 49:19.957
And I never heard you
nail that one.

49:19.957 --> 49:21.125
Let me hear you say it.

49:21.125 --> 49:23.327
Beyoncé what?

49:23.327 --> 49:25.596
A little bit more.
'Cause the joke is "say what?"

49:25.596 --> 49:27.998
-Beyoncé what?
-There you go.

49:27.998 --> 49:28.666
Eight times the charm.

49:28.666 --> 49:30.668
Well, you know.

49:30.668 --> 49:32.536
Plastique Tiara.

49:32.536 --> 49:35.306
Tonight on the runway
you look stunning.

49:35.306 --> 49:37.641
I wish, however, you weren't
wearing the same boots

49:37.641 --> 49:39.577
that you had on in the thing.

49:39.577 --> 49:42.112
I thought you were a standout
in the video.

49:42.112 --> 49:44.281
-Rich, I say!
-Absolutely hilarious.

49:44.281 --> 49:45.716
You were a scene-stealer.

49:45.716 --> 49:47.484
Every time you said a line,
I was laughing.

49:47.484 --> 49:50.354
This is a good season
of Drag Race.

49:50.354 --> 49:51.589
I'm in love with you all
already.

49:51.589 --> 49:53.490
That will go in the promo.

49:56.727 --> 49:59.363
Up next, Shuga Cain, "Scorpico."

49:59.363 --> 50:01.232
You look beautiful.
Your makeup is stunning.

50:01.232 --> 50:04.201
But I could not tell you
that you're a Scorpio.

50:04.201 --> 50:07.404
Literally, I got no Scorpio.

50:07.404 --> 50:10.674
But your performance
as Auntie Max'ine--

50:10.674 --> 50:13.544
That is some good shit.

50:13.544 --> 50:15.179
You blew me away.

50:15.179 --> 50:16.714
Your job is to come in,
knock it out of the park,

50:16.714 --> 50:17.715
and get out of there.

50:17.715 --> 50:18.549
You did that perfectly.

50:18.549 --> 50:20.017
Thank you.

50:20.017 --> 50:22.319
Up next, Ariel Versace.

50:22.319 --> 50:24.488
I love this look.
It's just so sweet.

50:24.488 --> 50:26.323
I will say it didn't make sense
for you to pick your shirt up

50:26.323 --> 50:27.725
when you were
all the way back there

50:27.725 --> 50:29.360
and we could barely see it.

50:29.360 --> 50:31.028
Okay.

50:31.028 --> 50:32.529
In the challenge, I feel like
I could see you in your head.

50:32.529 --> 50:34.098
You could see you
trying to get to your moment.

50:34.098 --> 50:37.735
It was a little clunky,
your timing together.

50:37.735 --> 50:41.138
Up next, Scarlet Envy.

50:41.138 --> 50:42.473
I really love the fact

50:42.473 --> 50:45.209
that you contoured your breasts
with turquoise.

50:46.677 --> 50:48.212
That's amazing.

50:48.212 --> 50:50.114
I've been watching this show
for a long time,

50:50.114 --> 50:51.682
and I don't think I've seen
anyone come out with bubbles.

50:51.682 --> 50:53.384
That was a genius idea.

50:53.384 --> 50:54.752
That part that you played,

50:54.752 --> 50:57.621
a lot of people play that
sort of, "Oh, I'm in peril!

50:57.621 --> 51:00.691
What do I do?" thing
at this level the whole time.

51:00.691 --> 51:01.892
And I'm already annoyed
with myself.

51:03.627 --> 51:05.429
What you were able to do

51:05.429 --> 51:07.464
was find peaks and valleys
in the performance.

51:07.464 --> 51:11.302
I didn't know
how much you had to offer.

51:11.302 --> 51:12.469
I just want to say
I was chosen last.

51:12.469 --> 51:13.671
Yeah, she was, fuck.

51:13.671 --> 51:17.074
And that shook me.

51:17.074 --> 51:18.075
I really enjoyed it.
Nice work.

51:18.075 --> 51:19.076
Thank you.

51:19.076 --> 51:21.679
Up next, Yvie Oddly.

51:21.679 --> 51:23.647
Your acting, superb.

51:23.647 --> 51:27.251
It was fun to work with someone
with such passion for it.

51:27.251 --> 51:28.252
Thank you.

51:28.252 --> 51:30.220
You two have good chemistry.

51:30.220 --> 51:32.356
You guys work well together.

51:32.356 --> 51:34.725
And Yvie Oddly, you are weird
and you are fierce

51:34.725 --> 51:36.226
and I love it.

51:36.226 --> 51:37.361
Yeah,
and out of all the runways,

51:37.361 --> 51:39.263
yours was the best,
most committed.

51:39.263 --> 51:42.366
As a fan of the show,
I can't wait to see what you do.

51:42.366 --> 51:46.303
Mercedes Iman Diamond.

51:46.303 --> 51:50.174
Your outfit, um, compared to
what I'm seeing on this stage,

51:50.174 --> 51:52.176
it just really fell flat for me.

51:52.176 --> 51:53.177
You have to kick it up a notch.

51:53.177 --> 51:54.244
Okay.

51:54.244 --> 51:56.447
-Your performance.
-Upulence.

51:56.447 --> 51:58.515
Sometimes when I was trying
to get you to say opulence,

51:58.515 --> 52:01.318
it really sounded like you
were saying upland.

52:01.318 --> 52:02.419
Like Upland, California.

52:06.223 --> 52:09.994
I feel amongst these girls that
you get quiet and I lose you.

52:09.994 --> 52:13.063
Even right now on this stage,

52:13.063 --> 52:15.432
your shoulders is forward
and your hand is like this.

52:15.432 --> 52:17.167
You're diminishing yourself.

52:17.167 --> 52:19.470
I almost feel sad for you,

52:19.470 --> 52:22.006
like, maybe you don't feel
like you're worthy.

52:24.775 --> 52:28.712
I just don't feel comfortable.
I...

52:28.712 --> 52:30.681
Four years ago I had a stroke.

52:32.349 --> 52:35.652
And I lost half of my body.

52:35.652 --> 52:39.456
And after that, I pretend
like I'm comfortable

52:39.456 --> 52:41.125
when people see me.

52:41.125 --> 52:45.596
But inside, I'm like I don't
feel as pretty as I used to.

52:46.764 --> 52:48.665
You are beautiful, Mercedes.

52:50.467 --> 52:55.472
Don't allow that saboteur
to block your blessing here.

52:55.472 --> 52:58.609
Your moment is now.

52:58.609 --> 53:00.611
Thank you.

53:00.611 --> 53:01.845
Thanks, Mercedes.

53:04.248 --> 53:05.749
Kahanna Montrese.

53:05.749 --> 53:09.486
Your outfit, compared to these
girls who just went for it,

53:09.486 --> 53:11.021
I feel like
all you pretty much did

53:11.021 --> 53:13.023
was the horns
and some glitter.

53:13.023 --> 53:14.691
If I can do it, then no.

53:14.691 --> 53:15.826
I feel like I can do that.

53:17.594 --> 53:21.632
On set, I saw you
trying really hard,

53:21.632 --> 53:23.000
and I could really
appreciate that.

53:23.000 --> 53:26.136
I don't think
you got all the way there.

53:26.136 --> 53:28.272
Did you and Mercedes
try to sort of

53:28.272 --> 53:31.008
come up with a routine
or a stunt together?

53:31.008 --> 53:33.777
Because your roles really
did depend on one another.

53:33.777 --> 53:36.513
Um, no. I was--
Maybe if I just would have

53:36.513 --> 53:39.616
been more in sync with her,
we would have landed it.

53:39.616 --> 53:41.385
So it was
a missed opportunity,

53:41.385 --> 53:42.619
because you all
felt disconnected.

53:42.619 --> 53:45.122
Yes, ma'am.

53:45.122 --> 53:46.757
Thank you, ladies.

53:46.757 --> 53:48.158
I think we've heard enough.

53:48.158 --> 53:50.394
While you untuck backstage,

53:50.394 --> 53:52.129
the judges and I
will deliberate.

53:53.597 --> 53:56.700
Now just between
us squirrel friends,

53:56.700 --> 53:58.035
what do you think?

53:58.035 --> 53:59.503
Brooke Lynn Hytes.

53:59.503 --> 54:02.106
For me, on the set,
the thing she didn't do

54:02.106 --> 54:04.708
was be willing
to bend a little bit.

54:04.708 --> 54:06.543
Take after take
she did the same thing.

54:06.543 --> 54:09.713
Second and third take was
an opportunity to loosen up,

54:09.713 --> 54:11.248
actually breathe some life
into it.

54:11.248 --> 54:13.150
Plastique Tiara.

54:13.150 --> 54:15.719
Memorable, super-super funny.

54:15.719 --> 54:17.321
All around
really, really fantastic.

54:17.321 --> 54:19.623
If you're checking boxes
on week two,

54:19.623 --> 54:21.592
you've got talent,
you've got looks.

54:21.592 --> 54:23.727
I'm intrigued
by what she's gonna do next.

54:23.727 --> 54:26.063
I mean, what more
do you want on week two?

54:26.063 --> 54:27.498
Shuga Cain.

54:27.498 --> 54:29.766
As Auntie Max'ine,
she was a standout.

54:29.766 --> 54:32.336
One of the best, if not
the best in that team.

54:32.336 --> 54:35.305
It was funny
take after take after take.

54:35.305 --> 54:37.641
She played that auntie role.
She did. She did.

54:37.641 --> 54:39.476
Ariel Versace.

54:39.476 --> 54:41.311
Every time we gave direction,
she listened,

54:41.311 --> 54:43.480
but she didn't know what to do
with the information.

54:43.480 --> 54:46.450
Comedy's hard, and I think
she tried as best as she could,

54:46.450 --> 54:48.519
but it wasn't there yet.
I wanted more.

54:48.519 --> 54:50.521
Scarlet Envy.

54:50.521 --> 54:53.590
She was the most natural actress
out of all of them.

54:53.590 --> 54:55.159
Scarlet is a leading lady.

54:56.460 --> 54:58.362
Yvie Oddly.

54:58.362 --> 55:01.398
I am really intrigued by her.
I love her acting.

55:01.398 --> 55:02.966
I think she did
a really good job.

55:02.966 --> 55:03.967
I thought she was really funny.

55:03.967 --> 55:05.702
I dig that vibe.
I'm a big fan.

55:05.702 --> 55:07.504
Mercedes Iman Diamond.

55:07.504 --> 55:10.107
I do feel for her.
It's horrible what happened.

55:10.107 --> 55:14.545
But I feel like, use those flaws
and make it work for you.

55:14.545 --> 55:17.481
Look, there was no character
development in the movie.

55:17.481 --> 55:19.683
I don't remember
a thing she did.

55:19.683 --> 55:23.153
Also, her bow and arrow work
was--it was a lot of this.

55:24.488 --> 55:26.223
It was weird.

55:26.223 --> 55:28.392
-Kahanna Montrese.
-I needed more

55:28.392 --> 55:29.293
than just splashing
a little glitter on your pecs.

55:29.293 --> 55:30.561
The glitter on the chest

55:30.561 --> 55:32.229
looked like hair on her chest.

55:32.229 --> 55:33.030
-That's what I thought it was.
-Did you see that?

55:33.030 --> 55:34.364
It looked like hair.

55:34.364 --> 55:36.533
I tell you,
when we were directing her,

55:36.533 --> 55:38.168
I don't think
she understood this part.

55:38.168 --> 55:39.303
There is something
very sweet about her.

55:39.303 --> 55:42.172
I just don't know
if she's ready yet.

55:42.172 --> 55:45.142
Silence.
I've made my decision.

55:45.142 --> 55:47.211
I'll have the tuna fish on rye.

55:49.313 --> 55:50.447
Welcome back, ladies.

55:50.447 --> 55:53.183
I've made some decisions.

55:53.183 --> 55:55.319
Shuga Cain...

55:55.319 --> 55:56.620
you're safe.

55:56.620 --> 55:58.488
Thank you.

55:58.488 --> 55:59.489
Plastique Tiara,

56:01.358 --> 56:02.359
You're safe.

56:02.359 --> 56:03.760
Thank you.

56:05.429 --> 56:08.365
Scarlet Envy,

56:08.365 --> 56:11.969
Yvie Oddly,

56:11.969 --> 56:14.471
good God, girls, you've got it.

56:14.471 --> 56:17.474
Chemistry.

56:17.474 --> 56:19.376
Con-drag-ulations.

56:19.376 --> 56:21.578
You are both the winners
of this week's challenge.

56:23.580 --> 56:26.750
You've each won
a $2.500 gift card

56:26.750 --> 56:28.452
from The Crème Shop.

56:28.452 --> 56:29.653
You may join the other girls.

56:32.689 --> 56:35.425
I think
I have shown these ladies

56:35.425 --> 56:37.294
who they're fucking with.

56:39.630 --> 56:42.232
Mercedes Iman Diamond,

56:42.232 --> 56:46.003
this week, your performance
lacked sparkle.

56:48.238 --> 56:49.840
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

56:51.675 --> 56:52.743
Brooke Lynn Hytes.

56:54.211 --> 56:55.012
You're safe.

56:58.215 --> 57:01.718
Ariel Versace,
your ram was glam,

57:01.718 --> 57:03.387
but your Sissy wasn't sassy.

57:05.455 --> 57:09.293
Kahanna Montrese, you took
this challenge by the horns,

57:09.293 --> 57:11.461
but you still seemed sheepish.

57:15.532 --> 57:17.968
Kahanna Montrese,
I'm sorry, my dear,

57:17.968 --> 57:19.069
but you are up for elimination.

57:21.305 --> 57:23.240
Ariel Versace, you are safe.

57:23.240 --> 57:24.508
You may join the other girls.

57:24.508 --> 57:25.776
Thank you.

57:27.511 --> 57:29.646
Two queens stand before me.

57:29.646 --> 57:34.251
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

57:34.251 --> 57:38.088
and save yourself
from elimination.

57:40.524 --> 57:42.426
The time has come...

57:42.426 --> 57:44.661
for you to lip sync...

57:44.661 --> 57:50.367
for your life!

57:50.367 --> 57:52.536
Kahanna Montrese, this is it.

57:52.536 --> 57:53.704
Show the world what you got.

57:55.238 --> 57:59.343
Good luck,

59:45.682 --> 59:47.050
shantay, you stay.

59:49.719 --> 59:52.689
You may join the other girls.

59:52.689 --> 59:58.495
Kahanna Montrese, you are
a young queen with a big future.

59:58.495 --> 1:00:02.132
Now go out there
and work, bitch.

1:00:02.132 --> 1:00:05.469
Now sashay away.

1:00:05.469 --> 1:00:06.870
Thank you guys for everything.

1:00:09.406 --> 1:00:11.441
Love you, Kahanna.

1:00:11.441 --> 1:00:12.576
Something's coming, bitch.

1:00:12.576 --> 1:00:14.511
Something is coming.

1:00:17.147 --> 1:00:19.416
It hurts to go home second.

1:00:19.416 --> 1:00:22.018
Had I just had one more shot,

1:00:22.018 --> 1:00:24.521
they would have got
exactly who I am.

1:00:24.521 --> 1:00:26.122
That's why you gotta bring it
every single time.

1:00:28.959 --> 1:00:31.661
Con-drag-ulations, ladies.

1:00:31.661 --> 1:00:35.065
Now remember,
if you can't love yourself,

1:00:35.065 --> 1:00:37.067
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

1:00:37.067 --> 1:00:38.435
Can I get a whomp-whomp?

1:00:38.435 --> 1:00:40.136
-Whomp-whomp.
-Whomp-whomp.

1:00:40.136 --> 1:00:41.538
Now can I get an amen?

1:00:41.538 --> 1:00:43.440
-Amen!
-All right.

You'll be starring in two
she-vangelical talk shows.

1:01:05.762 --> 1:01:09.666
Please welcome
to the IBBN stage, Miss Vanjie.

1:01:09.666 --> 1:01:10.767
Thank ya, sisters.

1:01:10.767 --> 1:01:16.072

This is like exactly
what I was hoping to see

1:01:22.579 --> 1:01:25.215

I was coming to Drag Race.

I can't think of one, like,
positive thing

1:01:27.317 --> 1:01:29.452
about the challenge.

1:01:29.452 --> 1:01:32.789
I have three words
for all of you girls.

1:01:32.789 --> 1:01:34.925
Stink, stank, stunk.
