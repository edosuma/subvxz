WEBVTT

00:02.500 --> 00:04.166
I KEEP TELLING YOU,
I'M FINE.

00:04.166 --> 00:06.500
DO PEOPLE
WHO ARE FINE SPEND
THE ENTIRE AFTERNOON

00:06.500 --> 00:08.083
IN OUR BATHROOM
THROWING UP?

00:08.083 --> 00:09.333
BUT I'M FINE NOW.

00:09.333 --> 00:12.166
MOM. I'M NOT
TAKING SIDES,
BUT DAD'S RIGHT.

00:12.166 --> 00:13.166
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO GET BETTER

00:13.166 --> 00:14.250
UNLESS YOU GET
SOME REST.

00:14.250 --> 00:17.125
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.
MY OWN SON.

00:19.375 --> 00:22.333
GALE,
THE GUINNESS TAP
JUST RAN DRY,

00:22.333 --> 00:23.417
WE'RE OUT OF
STOLI,

00:23.417 --> 00:24.542
AND SOMEBODY
JUST FOUND

00:24.542 --> 00:25.834
A HAIR
IN THE PRETZELS.

00:25.834 --> 00:28.166
OK. CALL THE BEER DISTRIBUTOR.
TELL HIM HE'S A WEEK LATE.

00:28.166 --> 00:30.041
IF HE CAN'T GET HIS ASS
OVER TODAY, HE'S FIRED.

00:30.041 --> 00:31.708
GIVE THE GUY WHO FOUND A HAIR
A FREE DRINK.

00:31.708 --> 00:34.208
PUT OUT
A FRESH BOWL OF PRETZELS
AND THEN TELL MY HUSBAND

00:34.208 --> 00:36.500
AND MY TRAITOR SON
TO GET OFF MY BACK.

00:36.500 --> 00:37.917
YOU HEARD
THE WOMAN.

00:40.458 --> 00:42.375
FOR THE SAKE OF
YOUR BUSINESS GO HOME

00:42.375 --> 00:44.208
BEFORE YOUR
CUSTOMERS CATCH
YOUR STOMACH FLU

00:44.208 --> 00:45.583
AND WE HAVE
TO RENAME
THE RESTAURANT

00:45.583 --> 00:47.208
LEERY'S PENDING
LAWSUIT.

00:48.208 --> 00:49.458
HE'S RIGHT.

00:49.458 --> 00:53.250
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
I GIVE UP.

00:55.750 --> 00:56.750
SHE PROMISED ME
SHE'D GO

00:56.750 --> 00:57.792
TO THE DOCTOR
LAST WEEK.

00:57.792 --> 00:59.208
I THOUGHT SHE HAD
THE SAME THING YOU HAD.

00:59.208 --> 01:00.291
YOURS DIDN'T
KEEP COMING BACK.

01:00.291 --> 01:02.917
GUYS, GALE'S BEEN
THROWING UP A LOT, RIGHT?

01:02.917 --> 01:05.375
AND SHE'S STILL HUNGRY
AND PUTTING ON SOME WEIGHT?

01:05.375 --> 01:06.834
SHE'S TIRED ALL THE TIME?
HER BACK HURTS?

01:06.834 --> 01:10.000
IRRITABILITY, MOOD SWINGS?

01:10.000 --> 01:12.417
YEAH.
THE WORST.
HOW'D YOU KNOW?

01:12.417 --> 01:16.083
SOUNDS TO ME LIKE SHE'LL
BE FEELING A LOT BETTER
IN ABOUT 9 MONTHS.

01:26.375 --> 01:27.583
WHAT?

02:23.458 --> 02:24.708
HOW'S IT GOING IN THERE?

02:24.708 --> 02:26.625
Gale: I CAN'T
CONCENTRATE WITH YOU
TALKING OUT THERE

02:26.625 --> 02:28.041
ABOUT WHAT I'M DOING
IN HERE.

02:30.708 --> 02:32.959
OK, NOW IT'S
WAY TOO QUIET.

02:32.959 --> 02:34.959
UH, DAWSON, UM,
SO HAVE YOU STARTED

02:34.959 --> 02:37.458
STUDYING FOR
YOUR S.A.T.s, YET?

02:37.458 --> 02:41.125
TOOK THE S.A.T.s. TWICE.

02:41.125 --> 02:43.291
I KNEW THAT.

02:47.834 --> 02:51.125
IT'S PINK.

02:55.125 --> 02:56.792
Mitch: ALL RIGHT.

02:56.792 --> 02:58.125
ALL RIGHT. FIRST THING
WE DO IS, UH,

02:58.125 --> 03:01.125
WE GET YOU TO
A DOCTOR A.S.A.P.
TO CONFIRM YOUR RESULTS

03:01.125 --> 03:02.750
AND MAKE SURE
EVERYTHING'S OK.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.500
WHERE YOU GOING?

03:04.500 --> 03:08.834
UH, I'M LATE. IT'S MY FIRST DAY
PAINTING MR. BROOKS' HOUSE.

03:08.834 --> 03:10.834
WELL, AREN'T YOU
GOING TO SAY
ANYTHING FIRST?

03:10.834 --> 03:13.333
CONGRATULATIONS.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.375
UH-UH-UH.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.750
WHAT'S WRONG?
WHY'D YOU STOP?

03:30.750 --> 03:33.000
UH, WELL, BECAUSE
EVERY AFTERNOON,

03:33.000 --> 03:36.125
WE SIT OUT HERE
AND WE MAKE OUT, AND THEN
INEVITABLY AT SOME POINT,

03:36.125 --> 03:38.875
YOU STOP US, AND WE JUST
GO INSIDE AND WATCH TV

03:38.875 --> 03:39.917
FOR THE REST
OF THE AFTERNOON.

03:39.917 --> 03:41.375
SO TODAY I'M ISSUING
A PREEMPTIVE STRIKE.

03:41.375 --> 03:43.041
AND I'M ISSUING
A COUNTEROFFENSIVE.

03:43.041 --> 03:46.875
NO, NO. STOP RIGHT THERE.
HAVEN'T YOU EVER HEARD
THE TERM NO MEANS NO?

03:46.875 --> 03:48.125
I DON'T THINK
I'VE EVER
HEARD THAT FROM YOU.

03:48.125 --> 03:49.542
WELL, YOU'RE HEARING IT NOW.

03:52.250 --> 03:56.375
I'M SERIOUS.
IT'S TIME FOR US
TO WATCH SOME TV.

03:58.708 --> 04:01.333
LET ME GET THIS
STRAIGHT.

04:01.333 --> 04:02.959
YOUR GIRLFRIEND
OFFERS YOU HER LIPS

04:02.959 --> 04:06.458
IN THE SPIRIT OF TEENAGE
LUST, AND YOU'D RATHER
SIT HERE AND WATCH

04:06.458 --> 04:09.792
THE E! TRUE HOLLYWOOD
STORY  ON DANNY BONADUCE
FOR THE FOURTH TIME?

04:09.792 --> 04:11.083
YOU ALWAYS GET TO STOP IT.

04:11.083 --> 04:14.125
AND I NEVER GET TO STOP IT.
SO TODAY, I'M STOPPING IT.

04:14.125 --> 04:15.542
STOP IT, PACEY.

04:15.542 --> 04:16.458
I JUST DID.

04:16.458 --> 04:17.125
YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN.

04:17.125 --> 04:20.083
AND YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL.

04:20.083 --> 04:21.541
ARE WE HAVING
A FIGHT?

04:21.541 --> 04:23.708
WELL, NOT TO THE BEST
OF MY KNOWLEDGE.

04:25.500 --> 04:27.208
FEELS LIKE ONE
OF THOSE TIMES

04:27.208 --> 04:29.083
WHEN YOU SAY
THAT YOU'RE
KIDDING AROUND,

04:29.083 --> 04:30.417
BUT REALLY,
WE'RE HAVING
A FIGHT, PACE.

04:30.417 --> 04:33.583
I ASSURE YOU, EVERYTHING IS
PERFECTLY ALL RIGHT.

04:36.959 --> 04:39.083
HOW DID I GET MYSELF
INTO THIS?

04:39.083 --> 04:41.750
I WAS
A MEDIOCRE SOCCER PLAYER
BACK IN JUNIOR HIGH.

04:41.750 --> 04:43.125
I KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT KIDS.

04:43.125 --> 04:44.875
I'VE NEVER COACHED
ANYTHING IN MY LIFE.

04:44.875 --> 04:50.500
COME ON, COACHING PEEWEE SOCCER
IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY
TO HELP MOLD YOUNG MINDS,

04:50.500 --> 04:53.792
TEACH THEM ABOUT TEAMWORK
AND SPORTSMANSHIP.

04:53.792 --> 04:56.834
OK. THE ONLY REASON TO DO IT
IS BECAUSE IT LOOKS GOOD

04:56.834 --> 04:58.583
ON YOUR COLLEGE APPS.

04:58.583 --> 05:02.125
BUT DON'T WORRY. I TAKE
FULL RESPONSIBILITY SHOULD IT
TURN OUT TO BE DISASTROUS.

05:02.125 --> 05:03.500
DAMN STRAIGHT.

05:05.625 --> 05:09.083
OH! HEY, KIDS.
I'M ANDIE,

05:09.083 --> 05:10.959
AND THIS IS
MY BROTHER JACK.

05:10.959 --> 05:13.458
AND TOGETHER,
WE ARE ALL
ABOUT TO EMBARK UPON

05:13.458 --> 05:16.625
A SOCCER EXPERIENCE
THAT WILL ENRICH

05:16.625 --> 05:17.792
YOUR LIVES
FOR YEARS TO COME.

05:17.792 --> 05:20.208
Kids: OHH.

05:20.208 --> 05:23.834
OK. EVERYBODY WHO
WANTS TO HAVE SOME FUN,
RAISE THEIR HANDS.

05:27.500 --> 05:28.750
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

05:28.750 --> 05:30.792
HER NAME
IS MOLLY,
COACH JACK.

05:30.792 --> 05:31.542
MOLLY.

05:31.542 --> 05:33.417
YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK, MOLLY?

05:33.417 --> 05:34.333
HOW COME?

05:34.333 --> 05:35.875
'CAUSE SHE
HATES SOCCER.

05:35.875 --> 05:37.875
SHUT UP.

05:37.875 --> 05:40.583
SHE HATES SOCCER.
WHY DO YOU HATE SOCCER, MOLLY?

05:42.250 --> 05:44.125
OK. YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK,
THAT'S FINE.

05:44.125 --> 05:46.166
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TALK
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK.

05:46.166 --> 05:48.041
GEE, THANKS.

05:48.041 --> 05:50.959
I HEARD SOMETHING.
I THINK SHE TALKED.

05:50.959 --> 05:53.333
ANYWAY, WHAT MOLLY
DOESN'T KNOW IS THAT
BY THE END OF THE SEASON,

05:53.333 --> 05:56.500
NO ONE IS
GOING TO HATE SOCCER,

05:56.500 --> 05:58.166
'CAUSE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
SO MUCH FUN

05:58.166 --> 06:01.875
RUNNIN' AROUND, WINNING SOME
GAMES, AND EATING PLENTY
OF PIZZA AFTERWARDS.

06:01.875 --> 06:02.875
SO WHO'S WITH ME?

06:02.875 --> 06:04.458
Kids: ME! YEAH!

06:10.750 --> 06:13.667
I THINK YOU HAVE THAT SPACE
COVERED, MR. LEERY.

06:13.667 --> 06:16.458
UNLESS YOU'D LIKE TO BE
WORKING OFF YOUR DEBT
INTO THE NEXT MILLENNIUM.

06:16.458 --> 06:17.708
SORRY ABOUT THAT,
MR. BROOKS.

06:17.708 --> 06:21.750
WHAT MIGHT BE PROMPTING
SUCH A DISTRACTED PERFORMANCE?

06:21.750 --> 06:24.583
WORRIED WHICH POMPOM GIRL
TO ASK TO THE PEP RALLY?

06:24.583 --> 06:27.041
MIGHT I REMIND YOU THAT
ALTHOUGH I'M NOT PAYING YOU,

06:27.041 --> 06:28.333
IT IS YOU WHO OWES ME
THE DEBT OF SERVICE.

06:28.333 --> 06:31.000
SO I SUGGEST YOU WORK IT OFF
TO THE BEST OF YOUR ABILITY

06:31.000 --> 06:34.333
AND LEAVE THE JUVENILE ANGST
ON THE PLAYGROUND
WHERE IT BELONGS.

06:34.333 --> 06:35.834
WILL DO, MR. BROOKS.

06:35.834 --> 06:41.125
WELL, WELL, WHAT'S THIS?
FANCY YOURSELF A PHOTOGRAPHER,
AN ARTISTE?

06:41.125 --> 06:42.375
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THESE.

06:42.375 --> 06:44.375
COULD YOU LEAVE
MY PERSONAL PROPERTY
ALONE, PLEASE?

06:44.375 --> 06:46.208
SURELY THE BOY WHO STOLE
AND WRECKED MY BOAT

06:46.208 --> 06:49.333
IS NOT GIVING ME
A LECTURE ON THE SANCTITY
OF PERSONAL PROPERTY?

06:49.333 --> 06:50.792
PEDESTRIAN.

06:50.792 --> 06:51.792
WHOLLY UNINTERESTING.

06:51.792 --> 06:57.875
AMATEURISH AND
TERRIBLE COMPOSITION, TOO.

06:57.875 --> 06:59.792
YOU--YOU DIDN'T
TAKE THIS ON PURPOSE?

07:01.792 --> 07:03.500
WHEW!

07:04.625 --> 07:05.834
AS A PHOTOGRAPHER,

07:05.834 --> 07:08.250
YOU'RE A MEDIOCRE
HOUSE PAINTER, MR. LEERY.

07:08.250 --> 07:09.542
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS?

07:09.542 --> 07:11.250
THOSE PHOTOS
ARE COLD, UNEMOTIONAL.

07:11.250 --> 07:13.917
THERE IS NO SPARK.

07:13.917 --> 07:15.708
THANK YOU
FOR THE COGENT
ANALYSIS.

07:15.708 --> 07:17.583
I WILL KEEP THAT
IN MIND NEXT TIME.

07:22.959 --> 07:24.625
HEY, THERE.

07:26.542 --> 07:27.417
WELL, LOOKS LIKE
WE WERE BOTH ROBBED

07:27.417 --> 07:29.625
ON THAT
HISTORY TEST.

07:29.625 --> 07:31.917
"B-", MY ASS.

07:31.917 --> 07:32.667
WHAT DID YOU GET?

07:35.041 --> 07:37.792
I THINK
I SET THE CURVE.

07:37.792 --> 07:39.125
WELL, I CAN SEE
HOW THAT WOULD BE
AGGRAVATING.

07:39.125 --> 07:42.583
[GIGGLES]
JEEZ!

07:45.250 --> 07:48.333
WHAT'S WRONG?

07:48.333 --> 07:50.750
NOTHING.

07:50.750 --> 07:52.166
MASHED POTATOES
ARE COLD.

07:52.166 --> 07:54.083
I GOT YOU.
SO, IT'S JUST BEEN
ONE TRAGEDY

07:54.083 --> 07:55.917
AFTER ANOTHER
TODAY, HUH?

07:57.625 --> 08:00.125
MASHED POTATOES ARE COLD,
AND SO AM I.

08:00.125 --> 08:02.417
IS THIS ABOUT SEX?

08:02.417 --> 08:03.625
IS IT THAT OBVIOUS?

08:03.625 --> 08:06.125
HEH! NO, NOT REALLY.
IT'S JUST--

08:06.125 --> 08:07.583
IT'S JUST THAT
IT ALWAYS IS.

08:10.250 --> 08:13.291
I THINK PACEY
IS STARTING
TO GET IMPATIENT.

08:13.291 --> 08:15.583
JOEY, HE LOVES YOU.
HE'LL WAIT.

08:15.583 --> 08:16.750
BUT, JEN,

08:16.750 --> 08:18.667
PACEY'S NOT THE PROBLEM.

08:18.667 --> 08:21.000
IT'S ME.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.875
I MEAN, LET'S FACE IT.
THE WAITING JUST GOES
ON AND ON,

08:22.875 --> 08:25.875
AND AT THIS POINT,
EVEN I'M GETTING
IMPATIENT,

08:25.875 --> 08:28.834
BUT...FOR SOME REASON,
I JUST KEEP WAITING.

08:28.834 --> 08:29.959
JOEY, LET ME
ASK YOU SOMETHING.

08:29.959 --> 08:31.625
ARE YOU SURE
THAT YOU REALLY
WANNA HAVE SEX?

08:31.625 --> 08:33.332
OF COURSE
I WANNA HAVE SEX.

08:33.332 --> 08:35.875
THE QUESTION IS
AM I READY?

08:35.875 --> 08:39.375
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU KNOW. I MEAN...

08:39.375 --> 08:40.500
EVERYONE JUST SAYS
THAT YOU JUST KNOW,

08:40.500 --> 08:43.500
BUT WHAT IF THAT'S
JUST WHAT THEY SAY

08:43.500 --> 08:45.208
AND THEY NEVER
REALLY KNOW?

08:45.208 --> 08:46.667
JOEY, I THINK
THAT YOU'D FEEL
MORE READY

08:46.667 --> 08:47.291
IF YOU WERE
ACTUALLY PREPARED.

08:47.291 --> 08:49.458
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

08:49.458 --> 08:50.542
LISTEN...FOR GIRLS
IN NEW YORK,

08:50.542 --> 08:51.583
A VISIT
TO THE FREE CLINIC

08:51.583 --> 08:55.041
TO GET
BIRTH CONTROL,
SAFE-SEX ADVICE--

08:55.041 --> 08:56.250
IT'S A RITE
OF PASSAGE.

08:56.250 --> 08:57.417
IT'S LIKE GETTING
A BAT MITZVAH

08:57.417 --> 08:59.208
OR, YOU KNOW,
YOUR LEARNER'S
PERMIT TEST.

08:59.208 --> 09:00.417
THE FREE CLINIC.

09:00.417 --> 09:02.333
YEAH.

09:02.333 --> 09:04.041
THE TRUTH IS
I DON'T THINK

09:04.041 --> 09:05.125
THAT ANYBODY
EVER REALLY KNOWS
IF THEY'RE READY,

09:05.125 --> 09:07.875
BUT YOU DO KNOW
IF YOU'RE PREPARED,

09:07.875 --> 09:10.208
AND YOU'RE NOT.

09:10.208 --> 09:12.208
YOU'RE RIGHT.

09:12.208 --> 09:14.333
TO RESPONSIBLE
SEXUAL GRATIFICATION.

09:18.041 --> 09:19.750
TO WOMANHOOD.

09:19.750 --> 09:21.125
CHEERS.

09:25.834 --> 09:27.083
YOU OK?

09:27.083 --> 09:29.667
I'M FINE.

09:29.667 --> 09:33.458
LOOK, I'VE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT IT.

09:33.458 --> 09:35.708
I KNOW
THIS IS TERRIFYING.

09:35.708 --> 09:38.375
THERE'S SO MANY CARDS
STACKED AGAINST US,

09:38.375 --> 09:40.291
BUT IT'S GONNA BE OK.

09:41.125 --> 09:43.375
AND DON'T WORRY
ABOUT DAWSON.

09:43.375 --> 09:45.708
HE'S JUST SHOCKED,
BUT HE'LL BE FINE.

09:45.708 --> 09:46.750
IT'S A GOOD SHOCK.

09:49.375 --> 09:51.875
NOW, MITCH, HAVE YOU
THOUGHT AT ALL

09:51.875 --> 09:54.500
ABOUT HOW WE CAN POSSIBLY
SEND DAWSON TO COLLEGE

09:54.500 --> 09:57.917
AND  RAISE
ANOTHER CHILD?

09:57.917 --> 09:59.959
WE'RE ALREADY IN DEBT
AS IT IS.

09:59.959 --> 10:00.959
AND WHAT ABOUT THE FACT

10:00.959 --> 10:02.875
WE'RE NOT EXACTLY
25-YEAR-OLDS ANYMORE?

10:02.875 --> 10:04.208
DO WE EVEN HAVE
THE STAMINA

10:04.208 --> 10:06.917
TO BE PARENTS
ALL OVER AGAIN?

10:06.917 --> 10:08.417
THAT'S 20 MORE YEARS

10:08.417 --> 10:12.125
THAT WE WOULD
HAVE TO COMMIT
TO ANOTHER CHILD.

10:12.125 --> 10:14.250
NOT TO MENTION
WHAT WE PUT DAWSON THROUGH

10:14.250 --> 10:16.166
THESE PAST FEW YEARS.

10:16.166 --> 10:17.667
WHAT IF THAT
HAPPENS AGAIN?

10:17.667 --> 10:20.250
THAT'S NOT GONNA
HAPPEN AGAIN.

10:20.250 --> 10:21.917
I DON'T KNOW.
I CAN'T HELP THINKING

10:21.917 --> 10:23.834
THAT WE SHOULD HAVE
THOUGHT ABOUT THIS BEFORE.

10:23.834 --> 10:26.917
MAYBE THAT'S TRUE...

10:26.917 --> 10:28.917
BUT YOU'RE
PREGNANT NOW.

10:28.917 --> 10:30.792
I MEAN,
THAT'S THE REALITY.

10:30.792 --> 10:33.125
UM...

10:33.125 --> 10:36.959
MITCH, YOU'RE
AVOIDING ONE THING.

10:36.959 --> 10:39.291
JUST BECAUSE
I'M PREGNANT
DOESN'T MEAN

10:39.291 --> 10:42.291
THAT I HAVE TO STAY
THAT WAY.

10:42.291 --> 10:46.083
AND IF I WERE
TO MAKE THAT DECISION
RIGHT THIS SECOND...

10:49.792 --> 10:51.792
I WOULDN'T.

11:03.625 --> 11:04.291
HEY, GUYS.

11:04.291 --> 11:05.959
SO TRAGIC.

OUT ONTO THE FIELD

11:08.166 --> 11:11.333

11:17.000 --> 11:18.458
MOLLY'S OLDER SISTER.

11:18.458 --> 11:20.667
MOM HAD ME
WHEN SHE WAS 21,

11:20.667 --> 11:21.291
MOLLY WHEN SHE WAS 40.

11:21.291 --> 11:23.500
MM-HMM.

11:23.500 --> 11:26.417
THAT WOULD MAKE ME 28,
IN CASE YOU WERE WONDERING.

11:26.417 --> 11:28.542
GOTCHA.

11:28.542 --> 11:30.208
AND HOW OLD
WOULD THAT MAKE YOU?

11:30.208 --> 11:31.500
I'M 18.

11:31.500 --> 11:33.083
HMM.

11:34.667 --> 11:36.375

11:36.375 --> 11:37.834
UH, SISTER.

11:37.834 --> 11:39.875
OH. COOL.

11:39.875 --> 11:41.792
HEH HEH HEH.

11:41.792 --> 11:43.834
COACH JACK,
AM I MAKING YOU
UNCOMFORTABLE?

11:43.834 --> 11:46.917
[LAUGHS] NO.
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

11:46.917 --> 11:48.208
OH, I JUST THOUGHT
MAYBE YOU THOUGHT

11:48.208 --> 11:49.458
I WAS FLIRTING
OR SOMETHING.

11:49.458 --> 11:50.542
FLIRTING? WHY--
WHY WOULD I THINK
YOU'RE FLIRTING?

11:50.542 --> 11:52.917
BECAUSE I AM
FLIRTING.

11:52.917 --> 11:56.000

I-I'M FLATTERED

12:09.667 --> 12:12.708
ALL RIGHT, YOU MULL
THAT ONE OVER,

12:12.708 --> 12:15.250
AND I'LL JUST BE SEEING
YOUR SWEET FACE TOMORROW.

12:15.250 --> 12:17.333
UNTIL THEN,

12:17.333 --> 12:18.875
AU REVOIR,
COACH JACK.

12:28.166 --> 12:29.583
THAT OLD MAN
IS CLEARLY NUTS.

12:29.583 --> 12:32.041
THESE ARE GREAT,
DAWSON.

12:32.041 --> 12:33.792
ACTUALLY,
HE'S RIGHT.
THEY SUCK.

12:33.792 --> 12:35.625
NO, THEY MOST DEFINITELY
DO NOT SUCK.

12:35.625 --> 12:37.417
OH, IT'S OK.

TO SELF-DESCRIBED GENIUS.

BUT EVEN YOU CANNOT DENY
YOUR NATURAL ABILITIES.

OK, IF YOU DON'T STOP
TAKING MY PICTURE,

12:53.417 --> 12:54.750
I'M GONNA SMACK YOU.

HELP ME. I'M--

13:38.458 --> 13:39.542
WHEN I FOUND OUT...

13:39.542 --> 13:41.458
HEH. I WAS UPSET.

13:41.458 --> 13:43.875
REALLY? WHY?

13:43.875 --> 13:45.375
WELL, THEY'RE
IN THEIR FORTIES.

13:45.375 --> 13:47.375

ABOUT TO SEND A KID
TO COLLEGE.

13:47.375 --> 13:48.875
THEY BARELY
HAVE ANY MONEY
IN THE BANK.

13:48.875 --> 13:50.542
THEIR RELATIONSHIP
THE PAST COUPLE
OF YEARS

13:50.542 --> 13:52.625
HASN'T EXACTLY
BEEN ROCK-SOLID.

13:52.625 --> 13:55.417
EVERYTHING'S
SO UNSTABLE.
IT JUST SEEMS...

13:55.417 --> 13:58.500
COMPLETELY
IRRESPONSIBLE.
IT IS.

13:58.500 --> 13:59.708

FEEL THAT WAY.

WANNA FEEL THAT WAY,

FOR THEM.

SWING THAT?

THE RIGHT PERSON

TO FEEL BAD

A FEW QUESTIONS,

15:11.750 --> 15:14.417

AHEAD OF TIME

A LITTLE BIT

HAVING INTERCOURSE?

TO BE HAVING
INTERCOURSE.

THAT THERE IS

ARE YOU AWARE
THAT THERE IS

FOR THE SEXUALLY
TRANSMITTED DISEASES

15:46.792 --> 15:50.583

15:50.583 --> 15:52.417
AND ARE YOU AWARE
THAT WHILE THE PILL

15:52.417 --> 15:54.834
OFFERS EXCELLENT PROTECTION
AGAINST PREGNANCY,

15:54.834 --> 15:55.792
IT DOES NOT PROTECT

15:55.792 --> 15:58.458
AGAINST SEXUALLY
TRANSMITTED DISEASES?

15:58.458 --> 16:00.625
HAVE YOU HAD
SEXUAL RELATIONS
IN THE PAST,

16:00.625 --> 16:04.583
AND IF SO,
WERE THERE ANY INSTANCES
OF UNPROTECTED SEX?

16:04.583 --> 16:05.583
NO, I'M...

16:05.583 --> 16:08.375
A VIRGIN, 100%

16:08.375 --> 16:10.583
AND ARE YOU CURRENTLY
IN A MONOGAMOUS
RELATIONSHIP?

16:10.583 --> 16:11.500
SO FAR AS I KNOW.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.959
IS THERE ANY REASON
WHY YOU'D THINK

16:13.959 --> 16:15.458
YOUR PARTNER'S
NOT BEING MONOGAMOUS?

16:15.458 --> 16:16.750
OH, NO, NO! I--
I WAS JUST KIDDING.

16:16.750 --> 16:17.917
HE'S DEFINITELY
MONOG--

16:17.917 --> 16:19.875
YOU KNOW, JOEY,
SOMETIMES WE THINK
OUR PARTNER

16:19.875 --> 16:20.875
IS BEING MONOGAMOUS--

16:20.875 --> 16:22.125
NO, HE'S DEFINITELY
MONOGAMOUS.

16:22.125 --> 16:25.458
THERE'S REALLY
NO DOUBT IN MY MIND.

16:25.458 --> 16:27.166
REGARDLESS, IT'S IMPORTANT
TO PRACTICE SAFE SEX.

16:27.166 --> 16:30.291
NOW, IS YOUR PARTNER
WILLING TO WEAR CONDOMS?

16:32.959 --> 16:34.166
YES.

16:34.166 --> 16:38.291
MS. POTTER,
THESE AREN'T EVEN
THE HARD QUESTIONS.

16:38.291 --> 16:39.875
WHAT IF YOU
BECOME PREGNANT

16:39.875 --> 16:41.875
OR CONTRACT AN STD?

16:41.875 --> 16:44.625
I MEAN, THESE ARE
THE POTENTIAL
CONSEQUENCES OF SEX.

16:46.208 --> 16:49.125
OK. MAYBE
YOU SHOULD KNOW

16:49.125 --> 16:51.750
THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE COIN, JOEY.

16:51.750 --> 16:55.291
I MEAN, SEX CAN BE
A WONDERFUL, FUN,

16:55.291 --> 16:56.834
FULFILLING
PART OF LIFE.

16:56.834 --> 16:58.667
THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE ASHAMED
OR AFRAID OF.

16:58.667 --> 16:59.917
I JUST...

16:59.917 --> 17:02.834
WANT YOU
TO APPROACH IT

17:02.834 --> 17:05.040
WITH A CERTAIN LEVEL
OF MATURITY

17:05.040 --> 17:06.165
AND RESPONSIBILITY,
THAT'S ALL.

17:07.834 --> 17:10.916
OK. SO YOU SCHEDULED

17:10.916 --> 17:13.666

HERE YOU GO.

ABOUT BIRTH CONTROL,

YOU KNOW
THAT GIRL MOLLY,

17:37.542 --> 17:38.542
THE ONE
THAT NEVER WANTS
TO TALK?

17:38.542 --> 17:40.500
YEAH?

17:40.500 --> 17:41.625
I DON'T KNOW.
I FEEL LIKE I'M--

17:41.625 --> 17:42.708
I'M BRINGING HER
OUT OF HER SHELL

17:42.708 --> 17:43.959
OR MAKING
A DIFFERENCE
OR SOMETHING.

17:43.959 --> 17:45.959
YOU THINK
THAT'S STUPID?

17:45.959 --> 17:46.875
NAH, I THINK
THAT'S PRETTY AWESOME.

17:46.875 --> 17:49.667
THERE IS
ONE PROBLEM.

17:49.667 --> 17:51.291
YOU KNOW
THAT GIRL CAROLINE

17:51.291 --> 17:53.333
WHO COMES
TO PRACTICE
WITH MOLLY?

17:53.333 --> 17:56.500
I THINK SHE
PROPOSITIONED ME
YESTERDAY.

17:56.500 --> 17:58.917
WHAT? NO! OK.

17:58.917 --> 18:01.417
WAS SHE JUST FLIRTING?
I MEAN, MAYBE SHE WAS
JUST FLIRTING.

18:01.417 --> 18:03.708
NO, NO, NO.
NO, SHE WAS
ONE STEP AWAY

18:03.708 --> 18:05.375
FROM REACHING
HER HAND
DOWN MY PANTS

18:05.375 --> 18:06.667
AND CHECKING OUT
THE MERCHANDISE.

18:06.667 --> 18:09.417
EWW! OK, I DO NOT
NEED TO HEAR THAT.

18:09.417 --> 18:10.583
I KNOW, BUT YOU
GOTTA HELP ME,

18:10.583 --> 18:11.417
'CAUSE SHE
WON'T TAKE NO
FOR AN ANSWER.

18:11.417 --> 18:12.250
I MEAN, I THINK
THE WORD "NO"

18:12.250 --> 18:14.583
JUST TURNS HER ON
EVEN MORE.

18:14.583 --> 18:15.667
SO JUST TELL HER
YOU'RE GAY.

18:15.667 --> 18:18.667
ANDIE...

18:18.667 --> 18:20.542
THE WORD "GAY"
IS KIND OF
CONTROVERSIAL

18:20.542 --> 18:22.333
WHEN YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT
WORKING WITH KIDS.

18:22.333 --> 18:23.375
OH, THAT'S CRAP.

18:23.375 --> 18:25.000
I KNOW IT'S CRAP,
BUT IT'S A REALITY.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.166
I MEAN, ALL I WANNA
DO RIGHT NOW

18:26.166 --> 18:28.208
IS JUST PUT
"SOCCER COACH"
ON MY COLLEGE APPS,

18:28.208 --> 18:30.375
NOT "GAY

CRUSADER."

18:30.375 --> 18:33.542
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
I'LL HELP YOU OUT
WITH THIS.

18:33.542 --> 18:34.625

OH, AND, UH, JACK?
YOU KNOW, I JUST HOPE

18:37.083 --> 18:39.333
THAT YOU'RE
A BETTER COACH
THAN YOU ARE A PLAYER,

18:39.333 --> 18:39.959
BECAUSE YOU SUCK!

18:39.959 --> 18:43.792
HA! YES, ANOTHER ONE!

19:04.834 --> 19:06.875
GOOD. YOU GUYS
ARE HOME.

19:06.875 --> 19:08.792

TO TALK TO YOU.

19:08.792 --> 19:11.583
WHAT IS IT,
DAWSON?

19:11.583 --> 19:13.959
IT'S ABOUT
HOW I REACTED

19:13.959 --> 19:15.792
WHEN I FOUND OUT
THAT MOM
WAS PREGNANT.

19:15.792 --> 19:17.959
UM...

19:17.959 --> 19:19.750
I WAS
REALLY SHOCKED

19:19.750 --> 19:22.083
AND, UM...

19:22.083 --> 19:24.250
MAYBE
A LITTLE BIT
DISAPPOINTED,

19:24.250 --> 19:25.375
BUT I'VE BEEN
THINKING,

19:25.375 --> 19:27.583
AND I'VE JUST--
I'VE REALIZED
THAT...

19:27.583 --> 19:31.125
HEH!
THIS IS AMAZING.
I MEAN...

19:32.166 --> 19:33.333

A LITTLE BROTHER
OR SISTER.

IS THAT?

19:35.667 --> 19:38.083
DAWSON...

19:38.083 --> 19:40.291
WE'RE NOT
GONNA HAVE THE BABY.

19:42.583 --> 19:43.959
WHAT?

19:43.959 --> 19:46.667
I KNOW.

19:46.667 --> 19:49.000
BELIEVE ME,
THIS ISN'T EXACTLY

19:49.000 --> 19:50.583
THE WAY THAT WE
WANTED TO TELL YOU.

YOU KNOW,
W-WAIT A SEC--

19:52.917 --> 19:55.583
J-JUST...

19:55.583 --> 19:57.834
JUST LIKE THAT?

19:57.834 --> 19:59.542
YOU MAKE A DECISION
LIKE THIS IN A DAY?

19:59.542 --> 20:02.291
UH, WELL, NO,
ACTUALLY, DAWSON,

20:02.291 --> 20:03.834
IT WASN'T
JUST LIKE THAT.

20:03.834 --> 20:05.792
I HAD SUSPECTED

20:05.792 --> 20:08.000
THAT I WAS PREGNANT
FOR SOME TIME.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.208
I JUST DIDN'T
WANNA DEAL WITH IT

20:09.208 --> 20:11.583
BECAUSE I KNEW
WHAT MY DECISION
WOULD BE IF I WAS.

20:15.417 --> 20:16.291
I CAN'T
BELIEVE THIS.

20:16.291 --> 20:19.041
WELL, HONEY,
YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY.

20:19.041 --> 20:21.208
YOUR LACKLUSTER ATTEMPT
AT EXCITEMENT JUST NOW

20:21.208 --> 20:22.875
WASN'T EXACTLY
OSCAR-WORTHY.

20:22.875 --> 20:24.375
MOM, I MEANT
EVERYTHING
THAT I SAID.

20:24.375 --> 20:26.000
I'M TRYING TO BE
SUPPORTIVE.

20:31.542 --> 20:32.750
DAD, YOU ACTUALLY
AGREED TO THIS?

20:32.750 --> 20:34.333
YES, I DID.

20:34.333 --> 20:37.583
NO, DAWSON.
HE'S LYING TO PROTECT ME.

20:37.583 --> 20:39.000
IT WAS MY IDEA
AND MY SUGGESTION.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.542
AND YES, I KNOW.

20:42.542 --> 20:44.000
I'M A TERRIBLE MOTHER,
AREN'T I?

20:44.000 --> 20:45.834
TH-THAT'S NOT
WHAT I SAID.

20:45.834 --> 20:48.166
LET'S NOT PRETEND
IT'S NOT WHAT
YOU THINK, HONEY.

20:48.166 --> 20:50.542
IT'S NO LIE
THAT I HAVE MESSED UP

20:50.542 --> 20:52.417
AT BEING YOUR MOTHER
AT EVERY TURN,

20:52.417 --> 20:54.417
THAT I'M THE ONE
THAT TORE
YOUR FAMILY APART--

20:54.417 --> 20:57.166
WAIT A--
D-DON'T USE ME
AS THE EXCUSE

20:57.166 --> 20:59.417
FOR MAKING
THIS DECISION.
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

20:59.417 --> 21:01.667
IT'S NOT AN EXCUSE,
DAWSON.

21:01.667 --> 21:05.625
NO, I SAT DOWN,
AND I CONSIDERED
ALL THE FACTS.

21:05.625 --> 21:08.750
AND THE FACT IS...

21:08.750 --> 21:11.083
I CAN'T DO IT AGAIN.

21:11.083 --> 21:13.834
I CAN'T HANDLE
THE MISTAKES.

21:13.834 --> 21:16.125
NOW, YOU PUT
THAT TOGETHER
WITH THE MONEY ISSUES

21:16.125 --> 21:18.667
AND MY AGE
AND EVERYTHING ELSE,

21:18.667 --> 21:20.583
AND THE ONLY ANSWER
IS...

21:21.208 --> 21:25.625
I CAN'T HAVE THE BABY.

21:25.625 --> 21:26.917
NOW, HONEY, MAYBE YOU'RE
GONNA HATE ME FOREVER

21:26.917 --> 21:29.250
BECAUSE OF THIS,

21:29.250 --> 21:31.166
OR MAYBE YOU'LL
NEVER BE ABLE
TO UNDERSTAND,

21:31.166 --> 21:34.041
BUT THE FACT IS...

21:34.041 --> 21:36.125
THIS IS MY DECISION,

21:36.125 --> 21:38.291
AND I HAVE MADE IT.

21:38.291 --> 21:43.250
AND NOW
THIS DISCUSSION...

21:43.250 --> 21:44.625
IT'S OVER.

22:00.125 --> 22:04.125
[BREATHES HEAVILY]

22:15.583 --> 22:17.625
[KNOCKS
AT DOOR]

22:17.625 --> 22:19.375
HEY, YOUR MOTHER
WANTED ME
TO TELL YOU

22:19.375 --> 22:22.458
THAT BREAKFAST
IS READY.

22:22.458 --> 22:25.250
WELL, TELL MY MOTHER
I'M NOT HUNGRY.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.250
SHE ALSO WANTED ME
TO TELL YOU

22:29.250 --> 22:32.166
THAT SHE'S SORRY
YOU'RE UPSET.

22:32.166 --> 22:33.625
AND I CAN
PERSONALLY ATTEST

22:33.625 --> 22:36.458
TO HER NOT SLEEPING
A WINK LAST NIGHT.

22:39.166 --> 22:40.667
IS SHE REALLY
GONNA DO THIS?

22:40.667 --> 22:41.792
YES.

22:44.750 --> 22:46.041
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

22:46.041 --> 22:48.417
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

22:48.417 --> 22:50.583
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WANT.

22:52.542 --> 22:55.166
BUT I DO KNOW
THAT I DON'T
WANT HER

22:55.166 --> 22:56.291
GOING THROUGH
WITH THE PREGNANCY

22:56.291 --> 23:00.375
IF IT'S NOT
THE RIGHT THING
FOR HER TO DO.

23:00.375 --> 23:03.542
ULTIMATELY
IT'S HER BODY,
HER DECISION.

23:03.542 --> 23:04.708
I RESPECT THAT.

23:08.458 --> 23:11.125
WHAT IF IT'S
THE WRONG DECISION?

23:18.708 --> 23:19.959
DID I EVER TELL YOU

23:19.959 --> 23:21.667
THAT WE TRIED
FOR 3 YEARS
TO GET PREGNANT

23:21.667 --> 23:22.000
BEFORE WE HAD YOU?

23:22.000 --> 23:23.917
NO.

23:23.917 --> 23:26.708
YEAH.
WE'D JUST ABOUT GIVEN UP.

23:26.708 --> 23:31.417
AND THEN,
AFTER YOU WERE BORN,
WE TRIED AGAIN.

23:32.542 --> 23:35.583
5 YEARS OF HOPE
AND DISAPPOINTMENT.

23:35.583 --> 23:39.542
I HAD ALWAYS WANTED
A BIG FAMILY, YOU KNOW.

23:39.542 --> 23:43.542
A HOUSE FILLED
WITH LOVE
AND ALL THAT.

23:43.542 --> 23:45.667
ADMITTING
THAT IT WOULD
NEVER HAPPEN...

23:48.083 --> 23:50.750
THAT WAS DEVASTATING.

23:50.750 --> 23:53.500
BUT THEN, ONE MORNING,
I WOKE UP...

23:53.500 --> 23:57.291
I REALIZED
THAT IT DID HAPPEN.

23:57.291 --> 24:00.917
MY HOUSE
IS FILLED WITH LOVE,
AND MY LIFE IS FULL.

24:02.417 --> 24:04.291
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE FOR THE REST
OF MY LIFE,

24:04.291 --> 24:06.250
I'LL WONDER, "WHAT IF?"

24:06.250 --> 24:09.500
BUT NOW...

24:09.500 --> 24:12.250
I AM JUST SO GRATEFUL
TO HAVE YOU.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.250
AND YOUR MOTHER.

24:16.250 --> 24:18.583
MAKES ALL THE REST
EASIER TO DEAL WITH.

24:41.083 --> 24:44.458
Bessie: JOEY,
WOULD YOU PLEASE TELL
YOUR STUPID BOYFRIEND

24:44.458 --> 24:47.166
TO STOP SNEAKING
HIS SMELLY CLOTHES
INTO OUR LAUNDRY.

24:47.166 --> 24:49.667
I'M TRYING TO RUN
A BUSINESS HERE.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.667
AND I'M TALKING
TO AN EMPTY ROOM.

25:04.250 --> 25:05.083
Joey: WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

25:05.083 --> 25:07.875
NOTHING.

25:07.875 --> 25:10.333
JUST LAUNDRY.

25:10.333 --> 25:12.291
I GOTTA GO.

25:27.792 --> 25:29.834
AW, MAN, WE STINK.

25:29.834 --> 25:33.708
Caroline: READY
FOR THE GAME
THIS AFTERNOON?

25:33.708 --> 25:35.291
UH...

25:35.291 --> 25:36.583
WELL,
OUR DEFENSE SUCKS,

25:36.583 --> 25:39.500
AND OUR OFFENSE
IS MERELY TERRIBLE.

25:39.500 --> 25:43.041
HA HA!
I'M SURE THEY'LL
DO GREAT.

25:43.041 --> 25:45.208
SO, JACK,
LISTEN,

25:45.208 --> 25:46.875
I WAS THINKING
MAYBE TONIGHT,
WE COULD--

25:46.875 --> 25:51.041
OH, UH, JACK,
WE'VE GOT THAT THING
WE'VE GOTTA DO TONIGHT.

25:51.041 --> 25:52.417
AND WHO ARE YOU?

25:52.417 --> 25:54.375
I'M JACK'S
GIRLFRIEND.

25:54.375 --> 25:56.583
REALLY? I THOUGHT
YOU WERE HIS SISTER.

25:56.583 --> 26:00.208
OH, YEAH, UM,
WELL, ACTUALLY,
I AM. HEH HEH!

26:00.208 --> 26:01.417
I'M JUST MAKING SURE

26:01.417 --> 26:03.708
NO ONE LAYS A HAND
ON JACKERS HERE,

26:03.708 --> 26:05.542
'CAUSE, UH, NATASHA--
THAT'S HIS GIRLFRIEND--

26:05.542 --> 26:07.125
UH, SHE'S A BLACK BELT,
AND SHE'D GET
REALLY PISSED.

26:07.125 --> 26:10.750
REALLY. NATASHA?

26:10.750 --> 26:12.375
NATASHA WHO?

26:12.375 --> 26:14.250
NATASHA...BOYARDEE.

26:14.250 --> 26:15.667
NATASHA BOYARDEE?

26:15.667 --> 26:19.291
[CHUCKLING] LOOK,
I REALLY APPRECIATE

26:19.291 --> 26:21.750
THE OVERPROTECTIVE
SIBLING THING. I DO.

26:21.750 --> 26:23.458
BUT I THINK
JACK HERE

26:23.458 --> 26:25.625
CAN MAKE
HIS OWN DECISIONS.

26:25.625 --> 26:28.667
AND HE'S DECIDED.
HE'S NOT INTERESTED.

26:28.667 --> 26:29.500
OR MAYBE
HE'S DECIDED

26:29.500 --> 26:32.083
THAT IT'S NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS

26:32.083 --> 26:33.083
AND YOU SHOULD
BUTT OUT

26:33.083 --> 26:34.625
AND LET HIM SPEAK
FOR HIMSELF.

26:34.625 --> 26:38.083
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S JUST NOT
GONNA HAPPEN, OK?

26:38.083 --> 26:39.083
AND WHY IS THAT?

26:39.083 --> 26:40.458
BECAUSE.

26:40.458 --> 26:42.166
THAT'S WHY?
BECAUSE?

26:42.166 --> 26:45.041
BECAUSE I'M GAY.

26:45.041 --> 26:47.458
ALL RIGHT?

26:49.667 --> 26:51.583
WAIT A MINUTE.

26:51.583 --> 26:54.083
OH! N--[LAUGHING]

26:54.083 --> 26:56.083
YOU DIDN'T
THINK I MEANT--

26:56.083 --> 26:59.000
BECAUSE I KNEW THAT.
HEH HEH!

26:59.000 --> 27:01.834
OF COURSE
I KNEW THAT.

27:11.125 --> 27:12.166
Dawson: HEY.

27:12.166 --> 27:14.208
HEY.

27:14.208 --> 27:15.375
UM, THANK YOU
FOR MEETING ME HERE.

27:15.375 --> 27:15.959
I DIDN'T WANNA GO
TO YOUR PLACE

27:15.959 --> 27:18.083
FOR OBVIOUS REASONS.

27:18.083 --> 27:19.542
UNDERSTOOD.

27:19.542 --> 27:20.792
WHAT'S UP?

27:23.417 --> 27:24.959
MY MOM IS HAVING
AN ABORTION.

27:24.959 --> 27:27.583
AND, UH,
I-I'M NOT SURE

27:27.583 --> 27:32.041
THAT I'M DEALING
WITH IT TOO WELL.

27:32.041 --> 27:33.291
AND ON--
ON TOP OF THAT,

27:33.291 --> 27:35.542
I FEEL AWFUL
ABOUT WHAT THEY MUST
BE GOING THROUGH.

27:35.542 --> 27:37.625
WELL, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM,
REALLY, DAWSON?

27:37.625 --> 27:41.875
ARE YOU WORRIED
ABOUT THEM?

27:41.875 --> 27:43.166
OR IS IT THAT
YOUR ILLUSIONS

27:43.166 --> 27:46.208
OF PARENTAL INFALLIBILITY
ARE FINALLY SHATTERED?

27:46.208 --> 27:48.708
WELL, THEY WERE
PRETTY MUCH
SHATTERED

27:48.708 --> 27:50.667
DURING
MY MOM'S AFFAIR.

27:50.667 --> 27:53.000
BUT, UM...

27:53.000 --> 27:55.583
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

27:55.583 --> 27:59.000
WHAT DO YOU THINK
MY PROBLEM IS, DAWSON?

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
I THINK
YOU WENT THROUGH

28:00.000 --> 28:01.917
WHAT MY MOM'S
GOING THROUGH.

28:02.500 --> 28:05.000
HEH. YOU'RE GOOD.

28:06.917 --> 28:09.041
UH, Y-YOU DON'T
HAVE TO TALK
ABOUT IT

28:09.041 --> 28:10.041
IF YOU DON'T
WANT TO.

28:10.041 --> 28:12.000
WELL, ISN'T THAT WHY
YOU CALLED ME HERE?

28:12.000 --> 28:14.166
[EXHALES]
I NEED TO UNDERSTAND

28:14.166 --> 28:15.166
WHY SHE'S DOING IT.

28:15.166 --> 28:16.291
AND I KNOW
THAT YOUR SITUATION

28:16.291 --> 28:19.625
IS PROBABLY
COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT, BUT--

28:19.625 --> 28:21.041
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
BE ABLE TO HELP ME.

28:21.041 --> 28:23.458
OTHERWISE,
I NEVER WOULD HAVE
BROUGHT IT UP.

28:23.458 --> 28:26.750
HEH! IT'S OK.
I GET IT.

28:32.708 --> 28:35.417
YOU'RE RIGHT.

28:35.417 --> 28:37.875
I DID GET PREGNANT
LAST SEMESTER.

28:40.208 --> 28:44.083
IN THE BACKSEAT
OF MY--MY BOYFRIEND'S
GEO PRIZM

28:44.083 --> 28:45.125
IN THE DORM
PARKING LOT

28:45.125 --> 28:48.834
WHILE MY ROOMMATE
WAS STUDYING FOR FINALS.

28:48.834 --> 28:52.667
LYNYRD SKYNYRD
WAS ON THE RADIO.

28:52.667 --> 28:55.667
AND I HATE
LYNYRD SKYNYRD...

28:55.667 --> 28:56.875
WHICH MADE ME
EVEN MADDER

28:56.875 --> 29:00.417
WHEN I FOUND OUT
THAT I WAS PREGNANT.

29:00.417 --> 29:01.166
SO, THERE I WAS,

29:01.166 --> 29:03.708
YOU KNOW,
20 YEARS OLD,

29:03.708 --> 29:05.542
PILES OF
STUDENT LOANS,

29:05.542 --> 29:08.000
A--A 2.9 GPA.

29:09.583 --> 29:12.667
SO I MADE
A DECISION.

29:12.667 --> 29:14.708
IT WAS
THE HARDEST DECISION

29:14.708 --> 29:17.417
THAT I EVER MADE
IN MY LIFE.

29:17.417 --> 29:20.083
[EXHALES DEEPLY]

29:20.083 --> 29:22.583
BUT IT DIDN'T
MATTER, BECAUSE...

29:22.583 --> 29:26.667
A WEEK LATER,
I WOKE UP,
AND IT WAS OVER.

29:29.250 --> 29:30.917
I HAD A MISCARRIAGE.

29:33.041 --> 29:35.959
AND YOU'D THINK
THAT I'D BE HAPPY,
YOU KNOW?

29:35.959 --> 29:38.917
BUT I WASN'T.
I FELT REALLY GUILTY.

29:38.917 --> 29:43.250
YOU KNOW, FOR--
FOR GETTING OFF EASY,

29:43.250 --> 29:46.750
FOR--FOR FEELING
RELIEVED,

29:46.750 --> 29:48.250
AND FOR PUTTING MYSELF
IN A POSITION

29:48.250 --> 29:50.917
WHERE I EVEN HAD TO MAKE
THAT KIND OF A DECISION.

29:53.875 --> 29:56.458
DOES THAT MEAN
THAT YOUR
DECISION

29:56.458 --> 29:57.125
WAS THE SAME
AS MY MOM'S?

30:01.333 --> 30:03.166
DOES IT
REALLY MATTER?

30:04.208 --> 30:05.917
NO.

30:09.625 --> 30:12.041
THANK YOU.

30:12.041 --> 30:12.583
FOR WHAT?

30:12.583 --> 30:15.291
FOR TRUSTING ME.

30:15.291 --> 30:18.333
I WON'T
TELL ANYONE.

30:18.333 --> 30:20.333
I KNOW YOU WON'T.

30:24.875 --> 30:28.583
Bessie: I HOPE YOU'RE HUNGRY.

30:28.583 --> 30:30.041
THIS IS GONNA BE DELICIOUS.

30:30.041 --> 30:32.125
HEY, I GOT
AN "A" ON THAT
ENGLISH TEST.

30:32.125 --> 30:34.291
OH, GOOD
FOR YOU, JO.

30:34.291 --> 30:35.708
YEAH, I WAS
UP ALL NIGHT
STUDYING AT PACEY'S.

30:35.708 --> 30:37.166
I'M EXHAUSTED.

30:37.166 --> 30:38.750
I'M SURE YOU ARE.

30:38.750 --> 30:40.500
EXCUSE ME?

30:40.500 --> 30:43.125
NOTHING.
PASS THE POTATOES.

30:43.125 --> 30:44.875
NOT UNTIL
YOU TELL ME
WHAT THAT MEANT.

30:44.875 --> 30:47.500
BODIE, DEAR,
WILL YOU PLEASE PASS
THE POTATOES?

30:47.500 --> 30:49.208
YOU'LL GET
THE POTATOES

30:49.208 --> 30:50.125
WHEN YOU TELL ME
WHAT THAT MEANT, BESS.

30:50.125 --> 30:52.875
YOU WANNA KNOW
WHAT IT MEANT? FINE.

30:52.875 --> 30:56.291
IT MEANT EITHER
YOU WERE AT PACEY'S
HAVING SEX ALL NIGHT

30:56.291 --> 30:58.208
OR YOU'VE STARTED
YOUR OWN MAIL-ORDER

30:58.208 --> 30:59.917
BIRTH-CONTROL BUSINESS
OUT OF YOUR BEDROOM.

30:59.917 --> 31:01.000
I KNEW IT!

31:01.000 --> 31:02.750
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU SNOOPED
IN MY ROOM.

31:02.750 --> 31:04.041
IT WAS HARD
TO MISS, JO.

31:04.041 --> 31:05.166
YOU'VE GOT
ENOUGH IN THERE
TO FILL A WAREHOUSE.

31:05.166 --> 31:07.166
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
I'D LOCK YOU IN THERE

31:07.166 --> 31:09.375
IF IT WAS LEGAL,
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT READY
TO HAVE SEX.

31:09.375 --> 31:12.041
OH, SO NOW YOU'RE PLAYING
MS. RESPONSIBLE CARETAKER?

31:12.041 --> 31:14.542
BESSIE, YOU LET ME SPEND
AN ENTIRE SUMMER

31:14.542 --> 31:16.667
SAILING AROUND ON A BOAT
WITH PACEY ALONE.

31:16.667 --> 31:17.834
I DIDN'T LET YOU.
YOU JUST WENT.

31:17.834 --> 31:19.959
WHAT COULD I HAVE
POSSIBLY SAID?

31:19.959 --> 31:21.250
NOTHING.

31:21.250 --> 31:24.166
JUST LIKE THERE'S
NOTHING THAT YOU
CAN SAY ABOUT THIS.

31:27.458 --> 31:30.917
THERE IS ONE THING
I CAN SAY ABOUT IT,
YOUNG LADY.

31:30.917 --> 31:33.375
YOU'RE MAKING
THE BIGGEST MISTAKE
OF YOUR LIFE.

31:33.375 --> 31:35.375
BESSIE,
FOR YOUR INFORMATION,

31:35.375 --> 31:37.000
I'M NOT HAVING SEX, OK?

31:37.000 --> 31:39.417
BUT AT SOME POINT,
I PROBABLY WILL,

31:39.417 --> 31:41.166
AND THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN DO TO STOP ME.

31:41.166 --> 31:42.625
YOU'RE
A 17-YEAR-OLD GIRL

31:42.625 --> 31:43.583
WHO DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
THE FIRST THING

31:43.583 --> 31:45.875
ABOUT CONSEQUENCES
AND RESPONSIBILITY.

31:45.875 --> 31:48.333
YOU ARE NOT READY
TO HAVE SEX!

31:48.333 --> 31:51.250
I AM THE OLDEST
17-YEAR-OLD
IN CAPESIDE, BESSIE.

31:51.250 --> 31:52.667
MY WHOLE LIFE
IS CONSEQUENCES

31:52.667 --> 31:53.667
AND RESPONSIBILITY,
OK?

31:53.667 --> 31:56.125
SO, IF YOU'LL
EXCUSE ME,

31:56.125 --> 31:59.542
I THINK I'LL GO
TO MY "BIRTH CONTROL
WAREHOUSE."

32:00.250 --> 32:01.875
BREAK!
BREAK!
BREAK!

32:01.875 --> 32:03.917
GO GET 'EM. GOOD LUCK.

32:07.708 --> 32:09.875
WHAT'S THE MATTER, MOLLY?

32:09.875 --> 32:12.250
YOU NERVOUS ABOUT THE GAME?

32:12.250 --> 32:14.291
BILLY AND TODD
AREN'T COMING.

32:14.291 --> 32:15.834
WE'RE DEFINITELY
GONNA LOSE.

32:15.834 --> 32:16.834
THEY'RE COMING.
THEY'RE JUST A LITTLE LATE,
THAT'S ALL.

32:16.834 --> 32:19.208
THEIR DADS CALLED MY DAD.

32:19.208 --> 32:21.250
THEY SAID THEY
HAD TO QUIT THE TEAM

32:21.250 --> 32:22.750
BECAUSE
YOU'RE DANGEROUS.

32:22.750 --> 32:24.500
THEY'RE NOT COMING.

32:27.708 --> 32:29.708
OK, UM...

32:31.417 --> 32:33.208
MOLLY, I WANT YOU
TO REMEMBER SOMETHING.

32:33.208 --> 32:36.250
WHETHER OR NOT TODD
AND BILLY QUIT THE TEAM

32:36.250 --> 32:40.041
OR IF, FOR THAT MATTER,
EVERYBODY QUITS THE TEAM,

32:40.041 --> 32:43.667
YOU AND ME ARE GONNA
PLAY SOME SOCCER,

32:43.667 --> 32:44.542
AND THEN WE'RE
GONNA GET SOME PIZZA.

32:44.542 --> 32:46.959
OK?

32:50.792 --> 32:53.834
DON'T WORRY, COACH JACK.
THEY'RE ALL JUST JERKS.

32:53.834 --> 32:56.875
I KNOW
YOU'RE NOT DANGEROUS.

33:27.166 --> 33:29.917
INTERESTING FLOOR SHOW
EARLIER,

33:29.917 --> 33:32.000
THOUGH I'M NOT SURE
IT'S GOOD FOR
REPEAT BUSINESS.

33:32.000 --> 33:36.917
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
I DON'T GET HER.

33:36.917 --> 33:39.166
I MEAN, IT'S
NOT LIKE I'M PERFECT
BY ANY MEANS,

33:39.166 --> 33:42.583
BUT THERE ARE A LOT
OF KIDS OUT THERE

33:42.583 --> 33:43.708
DOING A LOT
OF STUPID THINGS,

33:43.708 --> 33:47.208
AND I JUST THINK
THAT SHE LUCKED OUT
WITH ME.

33:47.208 --> 33:48.875
I'D SAY YOU'RE RIGHT.

33:51.959 --> 33:54.917
SO WHY IS SHE
BEING SO IRRATIONAL?

33:54.917 --> 33:57.000
YOUR SISTER WORRIES
ABOUT YOU, JO...

33:57.000 --> 33:58.583
ALL THE TIME, IN FACT.

33:58.583 --> 34:00.917
SHE DOESN'T WANT YOU
TO END UP LIKE HER.

34:00.917 --> 34:02.417
SHE WANTS MORE FOR YOU.

34:02.417 --> 34:05.458
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S
SUPPOSED TO GET OUTTA HERE.

34:05.458 --> 34:07.291
SHE JUST WANTS TO MAKE SURE
THAT HAPPENS.

34:07.291 --> 34:08.125
I KNOW.

34:08.125 --> 34:11.958
I HAVEN'T MADE
MY DECISION YET.

34:11.958 --> 34:15.750
ABOUT SEX, I MEAN.
I...

34:15.750 --> 34:17.708
I JUST THOUGHT
THAT IF I GOT PREPARED,

34:17.708 --> 34:18.708
THEN I WOULD BE READY,

34:18.708 --> 34:23.500
AND THEN AFTERWARDS,
I GOT REALLY SCARED.

34:23.500 --> 34:24.875
AND THEN THIS MORNING,

34:24.875 --> 34:26.875
I FELT LIKE
I WAS READY AGAIN,

34:26.875 --> 34:29.166
AND THEN...

34:29.166 --> 34:31.500
THIS AFTERNOON, I...

34:31.500 --> 34:32.708
I WASN'T SO SURE.

34:32.708 --> 34:35.083
YOU KNOW, JO, I CAN'T
TELL YOU WHAT TO DO.

34:35.083 --> 34:36.833
NO ONE CAN.

34:36.833 --> 34:39.291
FOR NOW, ALL I CAN SAY IS

34:39.291 --> 34:42.375
IF YOU'RE NOT READY
TO BE PREPARED FOR SEX,

34:42.375 --> 34:45.667
THEN YOU'RE PROBABLY
NOT READY FOR SEX.

35:05.417 --> 35:06.792
UM...

35:06.792 --> 35:10.875
I JUST GOT A FEW MINUTES
BEFORE I GOTTA GO
TO MR. BROOKS',

35:10.875 --> 35:12.625
BUT, UM...

35:12.625 --> 35:14.208
UH...

35:14.208 --> 35:17.667
I WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING
ABOUT HOW I FEEL
ABOUT YOUR SITUATION.

35:17.667 --> 35:20.333
MOM, YOU SAID
THAT WHEN YOU SAT DOWN
TO MAKE THIS DECISION

35:20.333 --> 35:23.291
THAT YOU CONSIDERED
ALL THE FACTS.

35:23.291 --> 35:25.959
BUT I THINK
YOU'RE FORGETTING
THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE,

35:25.959 --> 35:27.583
AND I JUST
WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU HAVE IT

35:27.583 --> 35:29.708
BEFORE YOU MAKE
YOUR FINAL DECISION.

35:31.125 --> 35:33.125
YOU ARE THE BEST MOTHER
THAT I KNOW,

35:33.125 --> 35:35.792
AND YOU'RE WRONG
IF YOU THINK

35:35.792 --> 35:37.583
YOU'VE DISAPPOINTED ME
AT EVERY TURN, MOM.

35:37.583 --> 35:39.208
ALL YOU'VE DONE
IS MAKE ME PROUD.

35:39.208 --> 35:42.125
YOU'RE NOT AFRAID
TO MAKE MISTAKES

35:42.125 --> 35:45.625
AND THEN TO PICK UP
AND TO KEEP GOING

35:45.625 --> 35:47.291
AND KEEP TRYING NEW THINGS,

35:47.291 --> 35:50.708
AND I OWE SO MUCH
OF WHO I AM TO YOU...

35:50.708 --> 35:52.333
TO BOTH OF YOU.

35:54.500 --> 35:57.041
I...

35:59.500 --> 36:02.750
I USED TO IDEALIZE
THIS PERFECT CHILDHOOD

36:02.750 --> 36:04.625
WITH THIS
PERFECT LITTLE HOUSE,

36:04.625 --> 36:08.125
AND THEN...

36:08.125 --> 36:09.041
YOU GUYS GAVE ME SOMETHING
SO MUCH BETTER.

36:09.041 --> 36:11.500
YOU GAVE ME SOMETHING REAL.

36:11.500 --> 36:13.542
AND WERE I
TO DO IT OVER AGAIN,

36:13.542 --> 36:16.000
I WOULD NOT CHANGE A THING.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.667
AND IF YOU GUYS ARE EVEN
HALF THE PARENTS
TO YOUR NEXT KID

36:18.667 --> 36:20.166
THAT YOU WERE TO ME,

36:20.166 --> 36:22.375
HE WOULD BE THE LUCKIEST KID
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

36:22.959 --> 36:25.750
THANK YOU, HONEY.

36:33.333 --> 36:35.875
IT'S GONNA BE OK, MOM.

36:52.458 --> 36:55.625
YOU KNOW, I THINK
WE SHOULD PROBABLY
SLOW THIS DOWN A NOTCH.

36:55.625 --> 36:57.875
OK.

36:57.875 --> 36:58.333
WHAT?

37:00.583 --> 37:01.792
LET'S TURN IT DOWN
A NOTCH.

37:01.792 --> 37:03.792
I MEAN, IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU WANT,

37:03.792 --> 37:05.625
I RESPECT THAT.

37:07.458 --> 37:09.250
OH...

37:09.250 --> 37:10.542
WELL...

37:10.542 --> 37:11.625
THANKS.

37:13.875 --> 37:16.542
PERHAPS YOU WERE HOPING
THAT IF YOU TURN
THE TABLES ON ME,

37:16.542 --> 37:17.917
I MIGHT GET PARANOID,

37:17.917 --> 37:19.291
'CAUSE I'M ALWAYS
THE ONE THAT'S
STOPPING THINGS,

37:19.291 --> 37:20.917
AND NOW, SUDDENLY,
YOU'RE STOPPING THINGS,

37:20.917 --> 37:22.417
SO MAYBE I
NEED TO GO FURTHER,

37:22.417 --> 37:25.125
MAYBE EVEN,
YOU KNOW, PAY A VISIT
TO THE FREE CLINIC,

37:25.125 --> 37:27.250
STOCK UP ON GOODIES,
AND BRING 'EM BACK HERE,

37:27.250 --> 37:29.208
AND THEN WE'D HAVE SEX.

37:29.208 --> 37:31.208
WAIT A MINUTE.

37:31.208 --> 37:34.000
DID YOU ACTUALLY GO
TO THE FREE CLINIC
TO STOCK UP ON GOODIES?

37:34.000 --> 37:36.667
I CAN NEITHER CONFIRM
NOR DENY SUCH REPORTS.

37:36.667 --> 37:37.750
ALL RIGHT, HOLD ON.

37:37.750 --> 37:39.166
UH, JO...

37:39.166 --> 37:43.542
I REALLY WAS--
I WAS JUST KINDA KIDDING
ABOUT THE WHOLE THING.

37:43.542 --> 37:46.583
ALL I WANTED TO DO
WAS TO JUMP-START
THE CONVERSATION.

37:46.583 --> 37:49.417
I'M ACTUALLY REALLY GLAD
THAT I WENT.

37:49.417 --> 37:52.750
SO IT'S...

37:52.750 --> 37:53.417
YOU KNOW, IT'S FINE.

37:53.417 --> 37:55.583
NO, IT'S REALLY NOT OK.

37:55.583 --> 37:58.333
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE YOU
DO ANYTHING THAT YOU'RE
NOT READY TO DO.

37:58.333 --> 38:00.750
I KNOW.

38:00.750 --> 38:02.542
AND, PACEY,
I GET IT.

38:04.041 --> 38:04.708
JUST AS LONG
AS YOU REALIZE

38:04.708 --> 38:06.208
THAT IF YOU DO TURN INTO

38:06.208 --> 38:09.083
SOME TYPICAL
HORMONE-FILLED,
SILLY-ASS BOY

38:09.083 --> 38:12.750
AND TRY
TO MANIPULATE ME AGAIN,
I'M OUT THE DOOR.

38:12.750 --> 38:14.125
JO, I'M SORRY.

38:14.125 --> 38:16.041
I KNOW.

38:17.667 --> 38:18.792
YOU KNOW, PACE,

38:18.792 --> 38:24.458
JUST BECAUSE WE'RE
NOT HAVING SEX YET,
IT...

38:24.458 --> 38:28.291
WELL, THERE ARE
CERTAIN THINGS
THAT WE CAN DO.

38:28.291 --> 38:30.333
WHAT KINDS OF THINGS?

38:33.333 --> 38:36.375
[WHISPERING]
I could kiss you.

38:36.375 --> 38:39.875
HMM. OR...

38:39.875 --> 38:45.083
PERHAPS I COULD JUST
COME OVER THERE AND...

38:45.083 --> 38:46.917
NO, NO, PACEY.
PACEY, NO!

38:46.917 --> 38:49.333
PACEY, STOP IT!
STOP IT!

38:49.333 --> 38:52.000
WHAT THE HELL
WAS I THINKING?

38:52.000 --> 38:53.834
WHAT POSSESSED ME
JUST TO BLURT IT OUT
LIKE THAT?

38:53.834 --> 38:57.000
COME ON, JACK, IT'S NOT
LIKE IT'S A BIG SECRET.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
ANYONE CAN FIND OUT
IF THEY WANT TO.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.500
I KNOW, I KNOW.
BUT IT'S NAIVE TO THINK

39:00.500 --> 39:02.083
THAT PEOPLE AREN'T
GOING TO CARE, YOU KNOW?

39:02.083 --> 39:03.583
IT'S NAIVE
TO THINK THAT PEOPLE
AREN'T GONNA BE

39:03.583 --> 39:06.708
SMALL-MINDED AND BIGOTED
AND IGNORANT AND THAT
THIS WHOLE THING

39:06.708 --> 39:07.667
ISN'T JUST GONNA GET
WORSE FROM HERE ON OUT.

39:11.083 --> 39:12.500
MAYBE I SHOULD
JUST QUIT.

39:12.500 --> 39:15.417
WH--OK, NOW THAT
IS RIDICULOUS, JACK,

39:15.417 --> 39:17.417
BECAUSE YOU
DID THE RIGHT THING.

39:17.417 --> 39:19.458
I MEAN, THE ALTERNATIVE
IS NOT TO TELL PEOPLE
WHO YOU ARE,

39:19.458 --> 39:22.166
AND WHO WANTS
TO LIVE LIKE THAT?

39:22.166 --> 39:27.333
AND BESIDES WHICH,
YOU ARE GREAT
WITH THESE KIDS.

39:27.333 --> 39:29.041
SO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
IS STICK WITH THE COACHING

39:29.041 --> 39:33.250
AND JUST STOP WORRYING
ABOUT THE PARENTS AND
THEIR STUPID HANG-UPS, OK?

39:33.250 --> 39:35.375
BECAUSE IT WILL BLOW OVER.

39:36.792 --> 39:38.583
BUT I'M A GOOD PERSON,
ANDIE.

39:38.583 --> 39:42.583
WHEN PEOPLE
LOOK AT ME, THEY SEE
SOMETHING AWFUL.

39:42.583 --> 39:44.208
DO YOU KNOW
HOW THAT FEELS?

39:44.208 --> 39:47.208
GIVE IT TIME.
IT WILL BLOW OVER, I SWEAR.

39:47.208 --> 39:49.291
NAH, IT NEVER DOES.

39:49.291 --> 39:51.291
IT WILL.

39:55.542 --> 40:00.667
DO YOU MIND IF I,
UM, FINISH UP ALONE?

40:00.667 --> 40:02.417
YOU SURE?

40:02.417 --> 40:03.417
YEAH.

40:03.417 --> 40:04.959
OK.

40:18.959 --> 40:20.458
EACH TIME I STEP OUT
ONTO THIS PORCH

40:20.458 --> 40:23.208
TO WATCH YOU AT WORK,
MR. LEERY,

40:23.208 --> 40:25.750
I BREATHE A SIGH
OF RELIEF THAT
I'M NOT PAYING YOU.

40:25.750 --> 40:29.166
THIS WAY, I CAN STILL
HIRE A PROFESSIONAL
TO PAINT OVER YOUR MESS.

40:29.166 --> 40:32.208
YOU KNOW, MR. BROOKS,
I ACTUALLY THINK I'M
DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB.

40:32.208 --> 40:35.417
WE ALL HAVE
OUR ILLUSIONS.

40:35.417 --> 40:39.041
AH, I SEE YOU'VE BEEN
HARD AT WORK ADDING
TO YOUR COLLECTION.

40:39.041 --> 40:43.375
AH, TRITE.

40:43.375 --> 40:45.875
A NAKED ATTEMPT
TO EVOKE SENTIMENT.

40:45.875 --> 40:48.750
WHY NOT JUST SHOOT
A PHOTO OF A PUPPY
IN GARBAGE CAN, HUH?

40:50.792 --> 40:51.750
HMM.

40:54.500 --> 40:58.083
"HMM"? THAT'S THE BEST
SCATHING CRITICISM
YOU CAN MUSTER?

40:58.083 --> 41:00.917
SOMETIMES HONESTY
IS SCATHING, DAWSON.
I CAN'T HELP THAT.

41:00.917 --> 41:03.458
BUT THIS LAST ONE...
AH...

41:03.458 --> 41:06.125
THIS LAST ONE
IS ACTUALLY NOT BAD.

41:06.125 --> 41:10.792
IT'S THE FIRST PICTURE
THAT MAKES A CONNECTION
WITH THE SUBJECT,

41:10.792 --> 41:15.458
AS IF YOU'RE NOT ONLY
SHOOTING HER MELANCHOLY
BUT YOUR OWN.

41:15.458 --> 41:17.667
THIS IS THE FIRST ONE
I'VE SEEN WITH A BIT
OF YOU IN IT.

41:19.125 --> 41:20.792
THIS ONE HAS POTENTIAL.

41:22.917 --> 41:26.458
I DON'T SEE YOU
PAINTING, MR. LEERY.

41:29.125 --> 41:30.333
