01:32.421 --> 01:37.021
We must have more men, Hardy,
more men.

01:38.380 --> 01:43.339
When you get back, tell them.
Tell them we need more men.

01:44.460 --> 01:46.859
We need a bigger Navy.

01:47.899 --> 01:50.178
We must have more recruits.

01:51.058 --> 01:53.218
You mustn't talk so much, sir.

01:53.338 --> 01:55.057
You must save your strength.

01:55.177 --> 01:57.177
I know.

01:58.536 --> 01:59.577
Kiss me, Hardy.

02:00.376 --> 02:02.376
I beg your pardon, sir?

02:04.456 --> 02:05.536
Kiss me, Hardy.

02:06.536 --> 02:10.014
Are you mad?
What will they say at the Admiralty, sir?

02:11.134 --> 02:12.895
They'll only be jealous.

02:14.814 --> 02:18.813
I don't know. You're very weak, sir.

02:18.933 --> 02:20.133
It may not be good for you.

02:28.411 --> 02:30.052
Told you so.

02:34.011 --> 02:37.730
It is usual for a cadet to spend a year
at the Naval Academy

02:37.850 --> 02:40.449
before qualifying and passing out,

02:40.569 --> 02:44.529
but you seem to be a somewhat
exceptional case, having taken...

02:44.649 --> 02:45.969
Let me see.

02:46.088 --> 02:50.367
- Eight and a half years, sir.
- Exactly, Albert Decker.

02:50.487 --> 02:52.128
Eight and a half years.

02:52.248 --> 02:54.807
The name is Poop-Decker, sir.
I have a hyphen.

02:54.927 --> 02:57.326
According to this report,
you have more than that.

02:57.446 --> 03:00.526
But as we are short of men,
we can't afford to be fussy.

03:00.646 --> 03:03.965
No, sir. I'm sure I shall pass out all right
next year, sir.

03:04.085 --> 03:06.405
I admire your confidence, Decker,

03:06.525 --> 03:09.285
but, unfortunately,
England cannot wait that long.

03:10.164 --> 03:14.003
While we're at war with Spain, we need
every able-bodied man we can get.

03:14.123 --> 03:18.043
I use the term "able-bodied" loosely,
of course.

03:18.163 --> 03:22.762
In your case, we've decided to forgo
the usual formalities of passing out,

03:22.882 --> 03:26.881
and present you with your
Midshipman's sword immediately.

03:29.161 --> 03:31.561
- Oh, thank you, sir.
- And thank you.

03:32.561 --> 03:34.160
Put it on.

03:35.080 --> 03:36.799
Put it on!

03:36.919 --> 03:38.239
Yes, sir.

03:39.919 --> 03:44.278
You will proceed to Plymouth
and join His Majesty's frigate Venus.

03:44.398 --> 03:45.638
Aye aye, sir.

03:45.758 --> 03:49.197
And please remember, Mr Poop-Decker,

03:50.037 --> 03:53.397
that you are a member of His Majesty's
Navy, and try and act accordingly.

03:53.517 --> 03:55.876
Don't worry, sir. You can depend on me.

03:55.996 --> 03:57.756
That is what I am afraid of.

04:09.514 --> 04:11.154
Whoa, there!

04:11.274 --> 04:13.073
Plymouth town!

04:17.673 --> 04:20.031
Hurry up, Captain Blood,
or the war'll be over.

04:20.152 --> 04:22.952
- Be careful or I'll start another one.
- I wouldn't put it past you.

04:23.072 --> 04:25.591
You insolent dog! Get my bag down.

04:29.510 --> 04:30.870
You dare.

04:38.349 --> 04:39.469
Go on! Get up!

04:42.388 --> 04:45.307
You watch where you're going!
Thank you!

04:51.826 --> 04:54.026
Oh, well.
They'll never know if I don't pull it out.

04:58.145 --> 04:59.745
Ow!

05:00.185 --> 05:01.585
Take you to the docks, Cap'n?

05:01.705 --> 05:05.344
Oh, yes. I want the frigate Venus.
If you think he can make it?

05:05.464 --> 05:08.943
Don't you worry about young
Lightning Legs. He'll be all right.

05:09.063 --> 05:10.704
- Take your bag?
- Thank you.

05:16.103 --> 05:18.462
<i>-</i> Hey up!
- Argh!

05:18.582 --> 05:19.662
Wait.

05:19.782 --> 05:21.382
Wait! Stop a minute!

05:21.502 --> 05:23.021
Whoa! Wait a minute!

05:23.501 --> 05:25.500
Stop it! Wait a minute!

05:26.541 --> 05:27.540
Whoa!

05:56.455 --> 05:58.535
There we are, Cap'n.

05:58.655 --> 06:01.014
That'll be just a crown, please.

06:01.134 --> 06:04.054
A crown? There's no bottom in that thing.
I've run all the way!

06:04.174 --> 06:06.293
Well, it's better than walkin', isn't it?

06:06.413 --> 06:09.613
- It's daylight robbery.
- Thank you, Cap'n. There's your ship.

06:09.733 --> 06:11.893
Oh, good. I must find Captain Fearless.

06:12.013 --> 06:14.172
You won't find nobody
aboard her now, Cap'n.

06:14.292 --> 06:16.971
- Why not?
- She sails first thing in the morning.

06:17.091 --> 06:20.571
They've all gone ashore
to get a last bit of you-know-what.

06:20.691 --> 06:22.691
- You-know-what?
- And I know where too.

06:23.490 --> 06:25.810
If I were you, I'd step ashore yourself.

06:25.930 --> 06:26.890
You would?

06:27.010 --> 06:30.010
It'll be many a long day
afore you see a young wench again.

06:30.130 --> 06:32.089
Again? But I've never...

06:32.729 --> 06:35.128
Well, of course, I wouldn't mind a bit of...

06:35.248 --> 06:36.249
You-know-what!

06:36.369 --> 06:38.687
Providing they're well-brought up ladies.

06:38.807 --> 06:40.127
Don't you worry, Cap'n,

06:40.247 --> 06:43.727
I know the perfect place
for a gentleman of quality like yourself.

06:43.847 --> 06:46.246
Good. How do I get there?

06:47.446 --> 06:48.846
No, not again.

06:48.966 --> 06:52.765
Half-fare, sir, as you're partly driving,
as you might say.

06:52.885 --> 06:54.005
You're on.

06:54.125 --> 06:55.844
We're going for a bit of...

06:57.605 --> 06:59.324
Forward!

07:29.079 --> 07:32.159
Is that right, Ned? The Venus leaves
for Spanish waters tomorrow?

07:32.279 --> 07:34.758
That's right, my lovely. What of it?

07:34.878 --> 07:36.798
Do you think
you could you smuggle me aboard?

07:36.918 --> 07:39.557
- What for?
- No questions asked.

07:39.677 --> 07:43.077
Oh-ho! That's different.

07:43.197 --> 07:44.796
Well, what about it?

07:44.916 --> 07:49.155
Supposing I did.
What would I get for me trouble?

07:50.276 --> 07:52.515
I've got five sovereigns saved up.

07:52.635 --> 07:54.595
I don't want your money, my lovely.

07:55.874 --> 07:57.674
You know what I want.

07:57.794 --> 07:59.594
Well, what's your answer?

08:08.512 --> 08:09.952
Whoa!

08:13.751 --> 08:15.311
Thank'ee, sir, thank'ee.

08:15.431 --> 08:17.830
- He needed a rest, poor old basket.
- Don't mention it.

08:17.950 --> 08:20.190
He's past it, you see.

08:20.310 --> 08:22.829
Must be dreadful,
carrying this day after day.

08:22.949 --> 08:25.229
It's better
than walkin' the streets, isn't it?

08:25.349 --> 08:31.068
As you weren't inside runnin' in comfort,
I'll only charge half fare and no tip.

08:31.188 --> 08:33.107
That's very generous of you, thank you.

08:33.227 --> 08:36.267
- Where's my bag?
- You'll find plenty of them in there, sir.

08:36.386 --> 08:39.907
- I meant my duffle bag.
- My dad's got it. Dad?

08:40.027 --> 08:42.785
- Is he going in there after women?
- What do you think?

08:42.905 --> 08:45.865
- I'll go with him!
- You will not! You get back in there.

08:45.985 --> 08:49.825
- I thought you said he was past it!
- He is, but his memory isn't.

08:51.065 --> 08:52.305
Thank you.

08:52.425 --> 08:56.183
- Oh, aren't you coming in with me?
- You won't need any help, Cap'n.

08:56.303 --> 08:59.823
Yes, but if these are nice young ladies,
I'll need to be introduced.

08:59.943 --> 09:04.022
Not exactly. Now, let me see.
Have you got a golden sovereign?

09:04.142 --> 09:05.023
Yes, I think so.

09:05.143 --> 09:07.701
There's a quaint old custom
in these parts,

09:07.821 --> 09:12.341
when a young gentleman goes courtin',
he holds in his hand a golden sovereign.

09:12.461 --> 09:15.860
This shows
that his intentions are honourable.

09:15.980 --> 09:17.260
If you know what I mean.

09:17.380 --> 09:19.699
Yes... What a charming custom.

09:19.819 --> 09:21.539
Isn't it?

09:21.659 --> 09:24.579
Thank you very much.
You've been most helpful. Thank you.

09:24.699 --> 09:25.979
Thank you.

09:28.218 --> 09:31.217
- I'd get in, if I were you. They'll be shut.
- Yes.

09:48.494 --> 09:50.814
Wait!

09:50.934 --> 09:55.013
No! Please!
I was told by a man in a sedan chair...

09:55.133 --> 09:59.813
Please, put me down!
Please...put me down.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.932
Argh! Oh!

10:03.892 --> 10:05.692
Oh, sorry, sir.

10:10.251 --> 10:12.931
Come on, darlin'.
You come and see what Peg's got.

10:13.051 --> 10:15.570
- Please!
- Come on. Come on!

10:15.690 --> 10:19.170
- Come on!
- That's far enough, Peg. Let him be.

10:19.290 --> 10:21.009
Can't you see
he's still wet behind the ears?

10:21.129 --> 10:23.528
We'll soon dry 'em for him!

10:23.648 --> 10:24.768
Oh, no, you won't!

10:24.888 --> 10:28.207
Ow! Oh, you rotten old bitch!

10:28.327 --> 10:29.567
Now, get out of here.

10:33.007 --> 10:34.167
Thank you.

10:34.287 --> 10:35.367
The same goes for you.

10:35.487 --> 10:36.526
You ought to have had more sense

10:36.646 --> 10:39.245
than to flash your money round
in a place like this.

10:39.365 --> 10:42.445
The man said
it was an old custom, you see.

10:42.565 --> 10:45.525
I just came in here to meet a...

10:45.645 --> 10:46.645
To have a bit of...

10:47.444 --> 10:49.644
I know. You men are all alike.

10:49.764 --> 10:51.843
We're supposed to be, aren't we?

10:51.963 --> 10:54.203
Get out of here
while you're still in one piece.

10:54.323 --> 10:56.003
I think I'd better, actually.

10:56.123 --> 10:58.802
We're sailing tomorrow
and I haven't reported aboard yet.

10:58.922 --> 11:00.242
- Wait a minute.
- Hm?

11:00.362 --> 11:03.202
- Are you on the Venus?
- Yes.

11:03.322 --> 11:05.161
I'm the new Midshipman.

11:05.281 --> 11:07.401
Poop-Decker's my name.
Albert Poop-Decker.

11:07.521 --> 11:09.640
And you haven't even
reported aboard yet?

11:09.760 --> 11:12.320
I did try earlier
but there was nobody there.

11:13.439 --> 11:17.959
Well, I'm certainly glad to have met you,
Midshipman Poop-Decker.

11:18.079 --> 11:22.118
Yes. Well, I'm very pleased
to have met you also.

11:22.238 --> 11:24.717
- What's your hurry, darling?
- Eh?

11:25.638 --> 11:27.877
You don't want to go
without a little bit of...

11:27.997 --> 11:31.157
- You-know-what?
- That's right.

11:31.277 --> 11:33.797
Let's go somewhere nice and quiet,
shall we?

11:33.916 --> 11:35.436
Oh!

11:37.195 --> 11:39.755
Well, I don't have to carry you up, do I?

11:48.994 --> 11:50.714
Come in, Albert.

12:11.110 --> 12:12.989
What's the matter?

12:13.109 --> 12:15.069
I was just remembering.

12:15.189 --> 12:18.268
Before I left home, my mother warned me
that things like this might happen.

12:18.388 --> 12:19.748
I must write and thank her.

12:19.868 --> 12:23.507
My mother always told me to be good.
I hope I am.

12:23.627 --> 12:25.987
You'd tell me, wouldn't you, Albert?

12:27.307 --> 12:29.986
Haven't you ever been alone
with a girl before?

12:30.106 --> 12:32.746
No, but I know what to do.

12:32.866 --> 12:34.626
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yes.

12:35.946 --> 12:38.585
Well, then,
let's get comfortable, shall we?

12:38.705 --> 12:40.105
Of course.

12:41.984 --> 12:44.344
There...that's better.

12:44.464 --> 12:48.503
- What lovely, curly hair you've got.
- Thank you.

12:48.623 --> 12:51.863
I get it from my mother, actually.
She's got curls all over...

12:53.382 --> 12:57.022
Close your eyes,
you naughty Midshipman.

12:59.021 --> 13:01.461
I'll tell you when you can open them.

13:12.299 --> 13:15.458
Keep your eyes tightly closed, Albert.

13:20.897 --> 13:22.697
I'm sorry, Albert.

13:26.736 --> 13:29.336
I would've been good, I promise you.

13:37.654 --> 13:40.734
It's the press! The press-gang, lads!

13:53.012 --> 13:54.892
Round the back.

13:55.012 --> 13:56.692
Come on.

14:02.970 --> 14:04.889
Somebody must've warned them.

14:13.489 --> 14:15.248
Evening, friend.

14:15.368 --> 14:16.688
Hello.

14:16.808 --> 14:18.087
Are you a sailor?

14:18.207 --> 14:20.607
Who, me? No!

14:20.727 --> 14:22.807
I'm a cesspit cleaner.

14:24.086 --> 14:26.886
I wondered why
there wasn't anybody else about.

14:27.006 --> 14:29.686
Wouldn't you like to go to sea, friend?

14:29.806 --> 14:32.325
Like to go to see what?

14:34.085 --> 14:35.724
Never mind.

14:36.364 --> 14:39.404
- Sign the gentleman on, Mr Angel.
- Aye aye, sir.

14:43.163 --> 14:45.043
Can I open them now?

15:05.719 --> 15:07.518
Where are my clothes?

15:24.196 --> 15:27.795
We need just one more this trip.
Let's try upstairs.

15:32.274 --> 15:34.314
Ssh!

15:34.434 --> 15:35.714
Get down.

15:53.191 --> 15:55.630
Lady Hamilton, I presume.

15:55.750 --> 15:58.310
Oh, no, I'm not a lady.
I'm not even a woman.

15:58.430 --> 16:00.390
I know what you're not, don't you worry.

16:00.510 --> 16:03.629
I just came in here to meet a...

16:03.749 --> 16:05.708
- Well, to have a bit of...
- Mm-hm?

16:05.828 --> 16:09.428
Then this girl took me upstairs
and she kissed me

16:09.548 --> 16:11.548
and she told me
to close my eyes like this...

16:11.668 --> 16:12.628
Really?

16:12.748 --> 16:14.747
...and not to open them until she said.

16:14.867 --> 16:15.987
- You don't say?
- Mm.

16:16.107 --> 16:17.946
- Then what happened?
- I really don't know, sir.

16:18.066 --> 16:22.625
Close them again, friend,
and let me see if I can help you.

16:22.745 --> 16:24.626
- Like this, sir?
- That's right.

16:25.905 --> 16:30.025
I wonder what it could have been
that happened. Something like this?

16:30.145 --> 16:31.784
Yes, that's exactly...

16:37.623 --> 16:39.263
- Mr Angel!
- Sir!

16:39.383 --> 16:41.382
Get those women ashore!

16:45.661 --> 16:47.422
Come on. Hurry up.

16:48.661 --> 16:50.861
You! Bring that cow aboard!

16:54.940 --> 16:58.779
Let fly the clew garnets.

17:02.818 --> 17:06.018
Out on the yards, you dockside scum,

17:06.698 --> 17:08.457
or I'll take a rope's end to you!

17:09.858 --> 17:14.057
Watch your course, damn your eyes!
You're all over the cursed sea!

17:14.816 --> 17:18.296
Belay those ropes,
you fatherless knot-heads!

17:18.415 --> 17:20.736
- Mr Angel!
- Come on, get a move on!

17:20.855 --> 17:22.775
Mr. . .Angel!

17:23.295 --> 17:25.775
Aye aye, Mr Howett! Move it!

17:29.614 --> 17:31.733
- Where's the Captain?
- Still in his cabin, sir.

17:31.853 --> 17:34.773
- Still in his cabin?
- No-one's seen him on deck.

17:35.533 --> 17:37.333
I'll find him.

17:37.453 --> 17:40.852
Mr Angel, break out
the new members of the crew.

17:40.972 --> 17:41.972
Aye aye, sir.

17:50.730 --> 17:52.490
Sir? Captain Fearless?

17:56.890 --> 17:58.649
Captain Fearless, sir!

18:02.568 --> 18:03.568
Who is it?

18:03.688 --> 18:06.047
It's me - Lieutenant Howett, sir.

18:10.606 --> 18:14.526
- The ship's under way, sir.
- I was aware of that, Mr Howett.

18:15.966 --> 18:18.645
Been getting a bit of fresh air, sir?

18:18.765 --> 18:23.324
What?
Oh, no, I was just...shooting the sun.

18:24.444 --> 18:28.483
- Can I offer you a glass of milk?
- No, thank you, sir.

18:28.603 --> 18:30.563
It's a bit early in the morning for me.

18:34.563 --> 18:37.402
There's nothing like it
for building you up, you know.

18:37.522 --> 18:40.601
Rather a brainwave of mine,
getting that cow aboard.

18:40.721 --> 18:43.361
With any luck, the crew should be able
to have a tot every day.

18:43.481 --> 18:45.040
Better for them than rum.

18:45.160 --> 18:49.000
- That should keep them happy.
- I imagine they'll be speechless, sir.

18:49.880 --> 18:53.839
A happy ship, Mr Howett.
That's the important thing. A happy ship.

18:53.959 --> 18:56.079
Speaking of happy ships,

18:56.198 --> 18:59.118
we got a couple
of new crew members last night.

18:59.238 --> 19:01.478
Ah. Willing volunteers, I trust?

19:01.598 --> 19:03.558
Oh, naturally, sir.

19:03.678 --> 19:06.037
Keen and full of enthusiasm, eh?

19:06.157 --> 19:08.316
They were carried away,
you might say, sir.

19:08.436 --> 19:11.516
Splendid. I'll have a word with them later.
Where are they now?

19:11.636 --> 19:14.596
I imagine they're still sleeping, sir.

19:14.716 --> 19:17.515
We didn't like to disturb them too early
on their first morning.

19:18.595 --> 19:22.114
Mr Angel has just gone down
to wake them now.

19:22.234 --> 19:24.434
Avast there!

19:24.554 --> 19:26.874
Get out of it, you mangy dogs!
Get moving!

19:26.994 --> 19:28.593
What's going on?

19:28.713 --> 19:30.433
How dare you treat us like this?

19:30.553 --> 19:32.113
Shut up and get up on deck!

19:32.233 --> 19:33.512
What deck? What are you talking about?

19:33.632 --> 19:35.072
We've been press-ganged!

19:35.192 --> 19:37.752
Volunteers, that's what you are.

19:37.872 --> 19:41.751
Volunteers? You don't seem to realise
who you're talking to.

19:41.871 --> 19:44.271
You've made a grave mistake.
Just wait till the Captain hears...

19:44.391 --> 19:46.270
Arrgh! Get going!

19:46.390 --> 19:48.029
Get going!

19:54.069 --> 19:57.188
- Whose little doxy are you?
- What are you doing tonight, dearie?

19:57.308 --> 20:01.627
- I demand to see the Captain!
- Who's asking to see the Captain?

20:03.867 --> 20:05.107
There's been a terrible mistake.

20:05.227 --> 20:09.266
And there'll be a few more
if you don't get that dress off pretty quick!

20:10.906 --> 20:13.546
Pipe down and get on with your work,
you dogs!

20:13.666 --> 20:16.865
That's the way to talk to them, mister.
You insolent upstarts.

20:16.985 --> 20:18.424
- Well done, mister.
- Thank you.

20:18.544 --> 20:20.664
If you don't mind, I'm running things here.

20:20.784 --> 20:23.464
And you're running them pretty well,
if I may say so, sir.

20:23.584 --> 20:27.663
I'll see that no blame attaches to you
when I report this misunderstanding.

20:28.822 --> 20:31.862
I can't tell you
how relieved I am to hear that, mister.

20:31.982 --> 20:35.061
Not at all, sir.
Fellowship of the sea and all that.

20:35.181 --> 20:37.181
If you'll take me back to port,
I'll join my ship.

20:37.301 --> 20:39.101
Pipe down!

20:39.221 --> 20:41.021
You'll get back to port all right...

20:41.141 --> 20:43.500
- Oh, good.
- ...In a year's time.

20:43.620 --> 20:46.500
A year? Oh, no!

20:46.620 --> 20:47.980
I've got a wife and nine kids.

20:48.100 --> 20:51.059
In that case,
the rest will do you both good.

20:51.179 --> 20:53.259
Listen to me the both of you.

20:53.379 --> 20:58.257
You are now serving as ordinary seamen
aboard His Majesty's frigate Venus,

20:58.377 --> 21:00.617
bound for distant parts as yet unknown!

21:00.737 --> 21:02.817
Excuse me. Did you say "Venus"?

21:03.616 --> 21:05.377
Yes, Venus.

21:07.256 --> 21:08.856
That's all right, then.
I've nothing to worry about.

21:08.976 --> 21:11.615
You won't think that
when I've done with you, mister.

21:11.735 --> 21:14.455
But this is the ship
I was supposed to join.

21:14.575 --> 21:16.134
I'm a Midshipman.

21:17.374 --> 21:19.933
Oh, yes.
You're a Midshipman, are you?

21:20.053 --> 21:22.573
- That's right. Midshipman Poop-Decker.
- That's very interesting.

21:23.853 --> 21:26.213
Would you tell me
something else, friend?

21:26.333 --> 21:29.532
Of course, sir. Anything at all for you, sir.

21:29.652 --> 21:31.931
Who is that up there, then?

21:33.291 --> 21:35.491
Let me see now. Um...

21:38.410 --> 21:39.610
Is it Nelson?

21:39.730 --> 21:41.090
No, he's got too many arms.

21:41.210 --> 21:43.849
Too many arms.

21:43.969 --> 21:45.369
You'll have to tell me. Who is it?

21:45.489 --> 21:48.569
Midshipman Albert Poop-Decker RN.

21:48.689 --> 21:51.928
Is it really?
I'd never have believed you'd get two...

21:53.128 --> 21:54.928
Just a minute. That's impossible.

21:55.048 --> 21:57.367
I'm Midshipman Poop-Decker.

21:57.487 --> 21:58.687
I've got papers to prove it.

21:58.807 --> 22:00.647
The devil seize me!

22:00.767 --> 22:04.526
I'm going to make you wish
that you were never born!

22:04.646 --> 22:06.086
I'm going to run you ragged.

22:06.206 --> 22:10.285
Before I've finished with you,
you'll be screaming for your mother!

22:10.405 --> 22:11.445
Mother!

22:11.565 --> 22:13.084
What's going on, Mr Howett?

22:13.204 --> 22:16.923
Oh! Just welcoming
the volunteers aboard, sir.

22:17.043 --> 22:20.363
Excellent! That's what I like to see -
kindness and consideration.

22:20.483 --> 22:22.363
What is your name, good fellow?

22:22.483 --> 22:25.442
Sweetly, sir. Walter Sweetly.

22:25.562 --> 22:27.002
What a pleasant name.

22:27.122 --> 22:28.642
What was your previous trade?

22:28.762 --> 22:30.802
A cesspit cleaner, sir.

22:30.922 --> 22:32.801
Well, it's a very pleasant name.

22:32.921 --> 22:35.440
- And yours, good fellow?
- That's what I was trying to explain.

22:35.560 --> 22:37.520
It's Poop-Decker. Albert Poop-Decker.

22:37.640 --> 22:39.920
That doesn't seem very difficult
to explain.

22:40.040 --> 22:41.960
Why's he wearing a woman's dress?

22:42.080 --> 22:44.599
They're a funny lot in Plymouth
nowadays, sir.

22:44.719 --> 22:46.918
Yes, I see what you mean.

22:47.038 --> 22:49.678
Takes all sorts, I suppose.
And what was your trade?

22:49.798 --> 22:52.518
I was trying to explain, sir.
I'm a Midshipman.

22:52.638 --> 22:55.997
You're certainly a mid something.
Eh, Mr Howett?

22:58.397 --> 23:00.436
No, before you came to sea.

23:00.556 --> 23:03.875
- My father's a farmer.
- A farmer?

23:03.995 --> 23:06.035
Excellent. Just what we were looking for.

23:06.155 --> 23:08.874
My boy, you can look after my old cow.

23:08.994 --> 23:11.954
Sir, I'm a Midshipman, not a lady's maid!

23:13.034 --> 23:14.314
Argh!

23:15.353 --> 23:17.193
Get him out!

23:17.313 --> 23:19.353
Grrr!

23:20.193 --> 23:21.553
I haven't done anything.

23:21.673 --> 23:23.872
I wouldn't be in your shoes
for a king's ransom.

23:23.992 --> 23:26.472
- Tell me what I've done!
- Get in there!

23:26.592 --> 23:28.032
- Shut up!
- Tell me what I've done.

23:28.152 --> 23:29.511
Ow! Ooh!

23:29.631 --> 23:33.470
You've got to make an
example of this wretch.

23:33.590 --> 23:36.790
Trying to pass himself off
as a Midshipman is bad enough,

23:36.910 --> 23:40.349
but to ridicule a member of your family
in front of the crew like that...

23:40.469 --> 23:44.349
I don't know, Mr Howett. It was
quite an understandable mistake, really.

23:44.469 --> 23:46.788
You don't know this man.

23:46.908 --> 23:48.788
- You don't know my wife.
- Your wife's irrelevant.

23:48.908 --> 23:50.787
You've noticed that, have you?

23:50.907 --> 23:54.787
I mean that she has nothing to do
with the matter in hand.

23:54.907 --> 23:56.306
I mean...

23:56.426 --> 23:59.426
Damn it, sir! He's guilty
of insolence and insubordination!

23:59.546 --> 24:02.185
I suppose you're right.
What have you to say for yourself?

24:02.305 --> 24:05.264
Only that I spoke truly.
I am Albert Poop-Decker RN.

24:05.384 --> 24:08.345
You see, sir, a hopeless liar.

24:08.465 --> 24:10.504
I'm afraid I agree with Mr Howett.

24:10.624 --> 24:14.263
I flatter myself I'm an intelligent man,
but look at you.

24:14.383 --> 24:15.703
You don't even look like
Midshipman Poop-Decker.

24:15.823 --> 24:17.262
How would you know what he looks like?

24:17.382 --> 24:19.542
How do I know? I can see him.

24:19.662 --> 24:21.822
Look for yourself.
You don't look anything like him.

24:21.942 --> 24:24.021
You might just as well say
he looks nothing like me.

24:24.141 --> 24:25.781
Quite. I'm glad we agree.

24:25.901 --> 24:27.781
Look at that fine, manly chest.

24:27.901 --> 24:31.660
Don't be ashamed Poop-Decker.
Not every young lad has one like that.

24:32.980 --> 24:33.939
How right you are, sir.

24:34.059 --> 24:36.060
The point I was trying to make is,

24:36.180 --> 24:39.578
just because he came aboard first
doesn't mean that he is Poop-Decker.

24:39.698 --> 24:41.378
I might as well say I'm Captain Fearless!

24:41.498 --> 24:44.658
Ah, so we're getting to the truth
at last, are we?

24:44.778 --> 24:47.777
You're Captain Fearless, are you?
Then why did you come...?

24:47.897 --> 24:50.217
Wait a minute. I'm Captain Fearless.

24:50.337 --> 24:54.016
- Of course you are.
- This is ridiculous, sir!

24:54.136 --> 24:57.935
If you're Poop-Decker,
prove it or pipe down.

24:58.055 --> 25:00.895
I know how I can prove it.
And my mum'll back me up in this.

25:02.015 --> 25:04.214
Albert Poop-Decker's got a mole on his...

25:04.334 --> 25:05.814
On his what?

25:05.934 --> 25:08.853
- Just on his, sir.
- Oh, I see.

25:08.973 --> 25:10.933
- Have you got a mole on yours?
- On my what, sir?

25:11.053 --> 25:12.093
Yes, your whatsir.

25:12.213 --> 25:15.852
- No, sir.
- Ah, well, I have.

25:15.972 --> 25:18.452
And I can prove it. I'll prove it.

25:20.412 --> 25:22.651
Please, sir, that won't be necessary.

25:22.771 --> 25:24.011
Aha! See?

25:24.131 --> 25:26.411
If he has a mole on his whatsir,

25:26.531 --> 25:27.531
he must be an impostor

25:27.651 --> 25:30.090
because Albert Poop-Decker
has no mole on his whatsir!

25:30.210 --> 25:34.250
This is preposterous, sir! This wretch
is making a laughing-stock of us.

25:34.369 --> 25:37.449
He is guilty
of insolence and insubordination!

25:37.569 --> 25:41.248
He should be punished severely.
If I were you, I'd throw the book at him.

25:41.368 --> 25:45.687
I don't exactly approve of brutality, but...

25:45.807 --> 25:47.846
There! I hope that'll be a lesson to you!

25:47.966 --> 25:48.967
No, no, sir!

25:49.087 --> 25:51.167
As First Officer I demand
that he be punished

25:51.287 --> 25:54.406
as severely as is laid down
in the Articles of War

25:54.526 --> 25:56.525
You want me to punish him more?

25:56.645 --> 25:58.445
A taste of the cat, sir.

26:01.884 --> 26:03.964
Oh, you mean that cat.

26:04.604 --> 26:05.603
Yes.

26:05.723 --> 26:07.643
You don't think that's a little severe?

26:07.763 --> 26:09.563
For him, never!

26:10.923 --> 26:13.282
Very well, then. You've asked for it!

26:15.042 --> 26:16.122
Will it hurt?

26:28.999 --> 26:30.520
- How many?
- Three.

26:30.640 --> 26:33.079
- Oh, good.
- Dozen.

26:33.199 --> 26:34.599
Three dozen?

26:34.719 --> 26:36.678
You won't feel anything
after the first dozen.

26:36.798 --> 26:38.718
- Why not?
- You'll be dead.

26:38.838 --> 26:39.917
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

26:40.037 --> 26:42.317
I don't like this. I don't like it at all.

26:42.437 --> 26:44.837
It'll do him good, sir.
He'll be a new man after it.

26:44.957 --> 26:48.637
How do you know he wants to be?
It's an outdated form of punishment.

26:48.756 --> 26:50.116
Prisoner seized up, sir.

26:51.315 --> 26:53.076
All men are assembled
to witness punishment.

26:53.196 --> 26:56.875
You don't think
we should change our minds?

26:56.995 --> 26:58.955
- Give in now, sir, and you're lost.
- Am I?

26:59.075 --> 27:01.994
Oh, well,
in that case, Mr Howett, carry on.

27:03.433 --> 27:06.513
Proceed with the punishment, Mr Angel.

27:06.633 --> 27:08.352
Aye aye, sir.

27:12.232 --> 27:13.871
Am I allowed a last request?

27:15.032 --> 27:17.072
Prisoner requests permission
to make a last request, sir.

27:17.192 --> 27:19.911
- What is it?
- What do you want?

27:20.031 --> 27:21.670
Can I keep my vest on?

27:23.670 --> 27:24.670
Can he keep his vest on?

27:24.790 --> 27:28.829
Oh, yes. There is a bit of a nip in the air.
We don't want him to catch cold.

27:28.949 --> 27:31.148
It might be a good idea to wait
for a better day.

27:31.268 --> 27:32.269
Permission granted!

27:32.389 --> 27:33.389
Thank you.

27:33.509 --> 27:37.548
Now, for heaven's sake,
proceed with the punishment, Mr Bosun.

27:37.668 --> 27:39.347
Aye aye, sir.

27:58.304 --> 28:00.104
Captain! Sir! Captain!

28:01.303 --> 28:04.583
Blister my stripes, he'll have to go.

28:04.703 --> 28:07.182
Proceed with the punishment, Mr Bosun.

28:09.062 --> 28:10.062
Ow!

28:12.022 --> 28:12.982
Oh.

28:13.102 --> 28:14.182
I hate you.

28:21.540 --> 28:22.739
Please!

28:22.859 --> 28:26.139
What the devil are you up to, Mr Angel?

28:26.259 --> 28:29.098
This isn't a knitting competition!

28:32.218 --> 28:34.058
Captain said I could keep my vest on!

28:34.178 --> 28:36.337
If I ever get out of this mess,
I'll wrap it around your neck!

28:45.016 --> 28:48.335
Here you are, Albert.
This is going to make you feel a lot better.

28:48.455 --> 28:51.135
Argh! Stop it, it's agony!

28:51.255 --> 28:53.854
Oh. What is it?

28:53.974 --> 28:58.373
The cook said if you add salt in
an open wound it makes the wound heal.

28:59.973 --> 29:01.653
That's funny-looking salt.

29:01.773 --> 29:02.893
No.

29:03.013 --> 29:05.812
It's not funny-looking salt,
it's funny-looking pepper,

29:05.932 --> 29:07.772
cos he hadn't got any funny-looking salt.

29:07.892 --> 29:10.171
What are you trying to do, kill me?

29:10.291 --> 29:14.131
Albert, you know very well
I wouldn't want to do that.

29:14.251 --> 29:16.610
You're my mate.
We're friends in misfortune.

29:16.730 --> 29:19.410
My misfortune is having a friend like you.

29:22.849 --> 29:24.809
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

29:24.929 --> 29:29.008
I know you're only trying to help, Walter.
Walter...

29:30.528 --> 29:33.567
That's better.
That's more like my old mate.

29:33.687 --> 29:35.087
Ow!

29:35.847 --> 29:38.887
I'm sorry. I forgot.

29:39.007 --> 29:42.566
If you can't do better than that,
just get out, will you?

29:45.846 --> 29:47.725
Funny-looking salt...

29:59.123 --> 30:00.402
Oh!

30:01.282 --> 30:03.802
Oh, that's much better, Walter.

30:03.922 --> 30:05.681
Yes, that's very soothing.

30:05.801 --> 30:09.081
- I'm terribly sorry about all this.
- That's all right.

30:09.201 --> 30:10.960
It's not your fault.

30:11.080 --> 30:15.440
It's that dirty, sneaking so-and-so
pinched my uniform and my name...

30:15.560 --> 30:17.079
<i>-</i> It's you!
- Ssh!

30:17.199 --> 30:20.319
Don't shush me! And get
your treacherous hooks off me or I'll...

30:20.439 --> 30:22.079
Please let me explain.

30:22.199 --> 30:24.878
You'll explain all right
to the Captain.

30:24.998 --> 30:27.398
Impersonating an officer.
You can get hung for that.

30:27.518 --> 30:29.638
How did you get hold of my uniform,
for a start?

30:29.758 --> 30:32.877
Don't you remember?
I'm Sally from Dirty Dicks.

30:34.956 --> 30:37.716
You're that girl who took me upstairs.

30:37.836 --> 30:41.355
I'm terribly sorry but I had to do it.
I was desperate.

30:41.475 --> 30:43.435
You see, I had to get to Spain somehow.

30:43.555 --> 30:45.195
- What for?
- To find my Roger.

30:45.315 --> 30:47.474
- Your Roger?
- My childhood sweetheart.

30:47.594 --> 30:50.074
- He used to lodge with us.
- Yes, I've heard of that gentleman.

30:50.194 --> 30:52.473
Four years ago,
he was press-ganged onto a ship

30:52.593 --> 30:54.033
which was taken by the Spanish.

30:54.153 --> 30:56.433
I'm determined to find him
if he's still alive.

30:57.313 --> 31:01.112
I know it's asking a terrible lot,
but will you keep my secret,

31:01.232 --> 31:03.672
just until we get near enough
to the Spanish coast

31:03.792 --> 31:05.191
for me to get away?
Please?

31:05.951 --> 31:08.511
It's all very well, but I worked jolly hard
to become a Midshipman!

31:08.631 --> 31:12.030
If you expose me now,
they'll send me back to England.

31:12.150 --> 31:13.470
I shall kill myself!

31:14.590 --> 31:16.029
All right, I'll keep your secret.

31:16.869 --> 31:18.149
Oh, thank you.

31:19.149 --> 31:20.269
You're wonderful.

31:24.268 --> 31:26.388
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

31:36.745 --> 31:39.185
Argh! Oh, my aching back.

31:39.305 --> 31:44.505
That won't be all that's aching if you don't
get off that bunk and get to work!

31:44.625 --> 31:46.144
Yes, sir.

31:46.824 --> 31:52.263
Mr Angel, I want you to try
and make a seaman out of this sow's ear.

31:52.383 --> 31:54.343
I don't care how long it takes
or how you do it,

31:54.463 --> 31:57.022
but he'll be a seaman if it kills him!

32:04.821 --> 32:08.900
Get moving, rot your guts!
What are you waiting for? Christmas?

32:14.260 --> 32:17.619
I want you in that crow's nest,
you crawling weevil.

32:17.739 --> 32:19.338
I know what you want.

32:19.779 --> 32:21.658
You want me in the crow's nest.

32:25.217 --> 32:26.657
Now get in there!

32:29.337 --> 32:30.577
Argh!

32:31.297 --> 32:34.256
Put your backs into it,
you drag-tailed jellyfish!

32:35.136 --> 32:37.815
All right, back!
Forward, back, forward, back.

32:39.175 --> 32:42.294
Forward, back! Forward, back!

32:42.414 --> 32:44.974
Heave to, that's enough.
Let's have a look at it.

32:50.813 --> 32:52.293
- Have you got it now?
- Hm.

32:52.413 --> 32:54.412
Just swing the lead twice and heave it.

32:54.532 --> 32:56.092
Right, try it, then.

32:57.652 --> 32:58.811
All right, heave it!

33:01.891 --> 33:04.651
I'm terribly sorry, it slipped.

33:05.570 --> 33:08.610
All right, now let's try it once more.

33:09.369 --> 33:12.609
This time, keep a firm hold of the end.

33:17.288 --> 33:18.328
All right, heave it!

33:24.567 --> 33:26.646
Man overboard!

33:28.206 --> 33:30.686
Clack-handed blundering bilge rats.

33:30.806 --> 33:33.965
We could have been sunk a dozen times
while you've been loading that.

33:34.085 --> 33:35.565
Let's try it again.

33:35.685 --> 33:37.204
This time, move!

33:37.324 --> 33:39.764
Charge! Powder!

33:42.244 --> 33:43.844
Ball!

33:45.684 --> 33:46.763
Ram it down hard!

33:48.763 --> 33:49.723
Prepare to fire.

33:51.482 --> 33:53.242
Harder!

33:55.201 --> 33:58.041
Fire! Get that ramrod out!

34:26.876 --> 34:28.476
You're looking for something, lad?

34:28.596 --> 34:30.955
Yes, sir. Where's the bathroom?

34:32.195 --> 34:36.954
We don't have conveniences of that sort
aboard an old scow like this, man.

34:37.074 --> 34:38.793
We go over the side.

34:38.914 --> 34:40.672
You've not been waiting
ever since we sailed?

34:40.793 --> 34:43.154
I want to have a bath, sir.

34:43.913 --> 34:45.793
A bath?

34:48.351 --> 34:51.231
I don't see what's so funny about that.

34:51.351 --> 34:54.031
Oh, no, no, of course not, lad.

34:54.150 --> 34:57.751
It's a very serious business, indeed,
taking a bath.

34:57.871 --> 35:00.230
Then perhaps
you'll tell me where it is, sir?

35:00.350 --> 35:03.670
Yes, of course. But you mustn't
fill it yourself. That's not on.

35:03.790 --> 35:08.628
I'll have Mr Angel get it ready for you
right away, Mr Poop-Decker.

35:09.588 --> 35:11.428
Thank you, sir.

35:11.548 --> 35:13.468
I'll be in my cabin.

35:16.508 --> 35:18.787
"Where's the bathroom"?

35:24.426 --> 35:27.385
Yes, who is it?

35:27.505 --> 35:30.665
Angel, sir. I wanted to tell you
your bath is ready for you, sir.

35:30.785 --> 35:32.864
Oh. Thank you, Mr Angel.

35:32.984 --> 35:34.664
Just a moment.

35:48.142 --> 35:51.182
- Thank you.
- I'll show you where the bathroom is, sir.

35:53.781 --> 35:55.341
In here, sir.

35:56.900 --> 35:58.860
Thank you, Mr Angel. That will be all.

35:58.980 --> 36:00.740
You wouldn't like me to scrub your back?

36:00.860 --> 36:02.779
No, thank you. I can manage.

36:02.899 --> 36:04.539
Excuse me.

36:12.697 --> 36:15.657
Here he is, maties! The water baby!

36:18.257 --> 36:22.056
I hope he hasn't forgot the powder
for his little you-know-what!

36:34.134 --> 36:38.533
What do you men think you're doing?
Get back to your duties immediately!

36:39.773 --> 36:41.892
What's the trouble, Mr Poop-Decker?

36:42.012 --> 36:43.892
Isn't the bath to your liking?

36:44.012 --> 36:46.372
I'm sorry
we couldn't get you a rubber duck.

36:49.651 --> 36:51.971
I prefer to bath in private.

36:52.650 --> 36:55.130
I'm awfully sorry
that there are so many people about,

36:55.250 --> 36:58.889
but, unfortunately, you've chosen the time
of the men's recreation period,

36:59.009 --> 37:00.849
but I'm sure that won't worry you.

37:00.969 --> 37:03.849
After all
you haven't got anything we haven't got.

37:05.888 --> 37:08.768
Oh, maties, I do believe he's shy!

37:08.888 --> 37:11.287
What are you waiting for,
Mr Poop-Decker?

37:12.367 --> 37:13.727
I've changed my mind!

37:14.246 --> 37:17.366
Oh, no, no. We can't allow that.

37:17.486 --> 37:19.126
Not after all the trouble we've been to.

37:19.246 --> 37:21.366
Help him off with his clothes, lads.

37:22.846 --> 37:24.725
No, you don't.

37:32.284 --> 37:35.843
You again!
You just wait till I get up there to you!

37:44.001 --> 37:46.481
On your feet!
The Captain wants to see you.

37:46.601 --> 37:48.001
- Come on, get moving!
- All right!

37:48.121 --> 37:50.441
I've got to pick up my ball and chain.

37:50.561 --> 37:52.880
I'll flay the hide off you. Get moving!

37:54.480 --> 37:56.279
Get up!

37:59.199 --> 38:00.438
Get out!

38:01.918 --> 38:02.919
The prisoner, sir.

38:03.039 --> 38:04.998
- How are you?
- Terrible, sir. Awful!

38:05.118 --> 38:07.277
I'm not surprised, after what you did.

38:07.397 --> 38:09.317
Don't play with me!

38:09.997 --> 38:13.837
Keelhaul me, string me up from the
highest yardarm, draw and quarter me,

38:13.957 --> 38:16.436
sew what's left in canvas
and chuck me over the side.

38:16.556 --> 38:18.996
Don't be silly.
That won't make you feel better.

38:19.116 --> 38:21.195
- What are you going to do with me?
- Nothing.

38:21.315 --> 38:22.874
Nothing?

38:22.994 --> 38:25.154
No. Mr Deck-Pooper, Dock-Pepper,

38:25.274 --> 38:27.634
has just told us
the whole thing was an accident.

38:28.273 --> 38:30.073
You did?

38:30.193 --> 38:32.833
- Thank you.
- That's all right. I couldn't...

38:33.713 --> 38:36.432
I only did it in the interests
of justice, sir.

38:36.552 --> 38:39.592
Smart young lad. We could do
with more of his kind in the navy.

38:39.712 --> 38:43.151
Am I to understand
that you're pardoning this man, sir?

38:43.271 --> 38:47.630
Of course. And I suggest we all forget
the entire incident. Agreed?

38:47.750 --> 38:48.790
Agreed.

38:48.910 --> 38:50.910
And we're all friends again, eh?

38:52.029 --> 38:54.989
Oh, come on, Mr Howett. Smile.

38:55.829 --> 38:57.949
Be a sport.

38:58.069 --> 38:59.828
Now shake hands on it, eh?

39:02.707 --> 39:05.227
Argh!

39:06.387 --> 39:10.906
Accident! Accident! Accident, sir.
You saw it, sir. Absolute accident.

39:15.026 --> 39:19.225
All right! All right! I don't like
the way things are any more than you do,

39:19.345 --> 39:21.225
but there's nothing we can do about it.

39:21.345 --> 39:24.424
Get back to work
or I'll flay the hides off the lot of you!

39:28.464 --> 39:32.503
- Well, Mr Angel?
- The lads are getting pretty restless, sir.

39:32.623 --> 39:34.223
I don't blame 'em.

39:34.343 --> 39:37.302
Three months at sea,
and no sight or smell of the enemy.

39:37.422 --> 39:40.061
We're not likely to.
We're right off the shipping routes.

39:40.181 --> 39:43.260
Stab my vitals, I don't know.

39:43.380 --> 39:46.101
I've never sailed
under a captain like this one before.

39:46.221 --> 39:49.139
If he's got a heart of oak,
it's got the worm in it.

39:49.259 --> 39:51.339
- Sail ahoy!
- Where away?

39:51.459 --> 39:54.459
On the starboard bow!

39:54.579 --> 39:55.939
Mr Burke!

40:00.218 --> 40:01.578
Ah, there she is.

40:03.018 --> 40:04.337
And she's a Spaniard!

40:04.457 --> 40:07.296
- Beat to quarters, Mr Angel!
- Aye aye, sir.

40:07.416 --> 40:09.616
Hands to battle stations!

40:14.255 --> 40:16.455
- Stand by to alter course!
- Aye aye, sir.

40:16.575 --> 40:20.134
- Maintop men, aloft!
- Maintop? That's us, Walter.

40:29.452 --> 40:32.212
What's going on?
What's all this jigging in the rigging?

40:33.612 --> 40:36.091
- What's going on?
- We've sighted a Spaniard.

40:36.211 --> 40:37.651
What? Where?

40:38.811 --> 40:41.210
Oh, she's much too small to bother with.

40:41.330 --> 40:42.890
Thank you.

40:45.490 --> 40:46.890
Are you sure she's a Spaniard?

40:47.010 --> 40:50.049
Yes, sir. We're cleared for action
and waiting for your order.

40:51.049 --> 40:53.009
Well, er... Um, yes. Er...

40:53.128 --> 40:56.128
We'd better have full sail,
wouldn't you say?

40:56.248 --> 40:57.328
Definitely, sir.

40:57.448 --> 40:58.568
Full sail, sir?

40:58.688 --> 41:00.087
Full sail, Mr Howett.

41:01.887 --> 41:05.566
Aye aye, sir. Full sail, Mr Angel.

41:05.686 --> 41:07.366
Aye aye, sir.

41:13.005 --> 41:15.605
- What did he say?
- Why don't you listen?

41:15.725 --> 41:18.324
He said, "Hy-aye-ya-mizzel
laardarm ya-mickelansals!"

41:18.444 --> 41:20.244
Oh.

41:20.803 --> 41:23.044
Here, what does it mean?

41:23.164 --> 41:25.962
Roughly speaking,
if the sails are up, you take 'em down.

41:26.082 --> 41:28.842
If they're down, you stick 'em...
You stick 'em up.

41:28.962 --> 41:31.601
- All sails are set, sir.
- Ah, right.

41:31.721 --> 41:34.082
- Now, she's going...?
- That way, sir.

41:34.202 --> 41:36.921
Right. Then we'll go that way.

41:37.041 --> 41:39.400
You mean,
we're running away from her, sir?

41:39.520 --> 41:41.520
Certainly not.

41:41.640 --> 41:44.160
We are making a strategic withdrawal.
Aren't we, Decker?

41:44.280 --> 41:45.279
We certainly are.

41:45.399 --> 41:48.079
With all clue respect,
I'd like to remind you of our orders:

41:48.199 --> 41:50.198
To patrol, seek out the enemy
and destroy him!

41:50.318 --> 41:52.758
Ah, but I've had other orders.

41:52.878 --> 41:54.517
"Long sea voyage...blah blah...

41:54.637 --> 41:57.557
"No worries...blah blah...no excitement."

41:57.677 --> 42:01.596
- These are Admiralty orders, sir?
- Oh, no. Doctor's orders.

42:01.716 --> 42:03.956
He was most firm
about the "no excitement" bit.

42:04.556 --> 42:07.796
But, sir, the Venus
has never run away from action before.

42:07.916 --> 42:10.435
We're all very proud
of her record of victories

42:10.555 --> 42:13.154
and the gallant men who fought with her.

42:13.274 --> 42:15.234
I mean, look, sir. That plate on the deck.

42:15.354 --> 42:17.754
That's where her last Captain fell.

42:17.874 --> 42:20.793
I'm not surprised.
I nearly tripped over it myself.

42:20.913 --> 42:22.553
If you'll kindly set the new course.

42:22.673 --> 42:24.953
East south-east.
Wouldn't you say, Decker?

42:25.073 --> 42:26.072
East south-east, sir.

42:26.912 --> 42:28.192
Aye aye, sir.

42:29.752 --> 42:31.432
Steer east south-east!

42:31.552 --> 42:33.351
Thank you, Mr Howett. Carry on.

42:33.471 --> 42:34.830
Come, Decker.

42:36.910 --> 42:39.230
What goes on between those two?

42:39.350 --> 42:41.150
- He'll have to go.
- Which one?

42:41.270 --> 42:42.830
Both of 'em.

42:43.310 --> 42:46.549
- Do you know what you're saying?
- Aye, and so do you.

42:46.669 --> 42:48.628
If you took command,
the lads would follow you to hell.

42:48.748 --> 42:52.467
Watch your tongue, mister. I'll have
no talk of mutiny on board this ship.

42:52.587 --> 42:55.947
Don't you worry.
I've no desire to swing from a yardarm.

42:56.067 --> 43:00.266
But if the Captain were to leave of his
own free will, in a manner of speaking...

43:02.466 --> 43:05.905
And who do you think
is going to make him do that?

43:06.025 --> 43:07.585
I think I know the very man, sir.

43:16.743 --> 43:19.183
- See anything, lad?
- No, sir.

43:19.303 --> 43:21.343
- It's very dark, sir.
- Yes, I know.

43:22.022 --> 43:23.982
- Keep a sharp look-out, though.
- Aye aye, sir.

43:24.102 --> 43:26.661
These are dangerous waters.
Anything can happen.

43:26.781 --> 43:28.782
We don't want to be surprised.

43:28.902 --> 43:31.901
Don't worry, sir.
You can depend on me, sir.

43:33.221 --> 43:35.500
- Good lad.
- Thank you, sir.

43:39.899 --> 43:43.299
- Have you got the boat down?
- Aye, sir, and everything in it as ordered.

43:43.419 --> 43:46.138
Good lad.

43:47.338 --> 43:50.417
Oh! Don't do that.

43:50.537 --> 43:53.697
What are you doin' up here?
Couldn't you sleep?

43:53.817 --> 43:55.976
I'm on lookout.

43:56.096 --> 43:58.696
- You?
- What's so strange about that?

43:58.816 --> 44:01.536
Mr Howett said he wanted a man
with a keen eye and an intelligent mind.

44:01.656 --> 44:03.975
Oh, I see!

44:04.095 --> 44:05.055
You're lookin' out for him.

44:05.175 --> 44:06.134
Yes...

44:06.254 --> 44:08.294
No! I am him.

44:09.534 --> 44:11.294
These are very dangerous waters.

44:11.413 --> 44:12.973
- Anything can happen here.
- Like what?

44:13.093 --> 44:15.133
- Well, it's a dark night, Walter.
- Yes.

44:15.253 --> 44:17.253
The enemy boat creeps alongside.

44:18.213 --> 44:19.932
He crawls up the anchor chain,

44:20.052 --> 44:21.852
he starts to creep towards the watch.

44:21.972 --> 44:24.532
- The next thing you hear is...
- Eeeuuaarrgh!

44:24.651 --> 44:26.211
Yes, exactly like that. That was good.

44:26.331 --> 44:28.371
How did you do it
without moving your lips?

44:28.491 --> 44:32.011
- Do what?
- That noise. That "Eeeuuaarrgh".

44:32.130 --> 44:34.929
That wasn't me.
That came from back there.

44:37.530 --> 44:39.129
- Sounded like someone being throttled.
- Eh?

44:39.249 --> 44:41.048
- Eh?
- Yes.

44:41.168 --> 44:42.368
Hello?

44:43.488 --> 44:45.847
Who's there? Yoo-hoo!

44:47.488 --> 44:49.367
There's no use hiding.

44:50.367 --> 44:52.086
Where are you?

44:53.686 --> 44:55.366
Don't do that.

44:56.446 --> 44:58.205
What was that?

45:00.005 --> 45:01.925
It's Mr Angel.

45:02.685 --> 45:05.005
Are you all right, sir? Mister?

45:07.124 --> 45:08.763
It's blood.

45:09.764 --> 45:11.724
No... More like red jam.

45:11.844 --> 45:16.842
Red jam? Does he look like a man
with red jam in his veins?

45:20.002 --> 45:22.001
Mr Howett...?

45:26.640 --> 45:28.480
Mr Howett!

45:30.520 --> 45:31.640
Yoo-hoo.

45:34.679 --> 45:37.039
- It seems to be working.
- Aye, sir.

45:37.159 --> 45:39.559
But he gave me a nasty moment there
when he mentioned jam.

45:39.679 --> 45:42.118
I'm not wasting real blood on those idiots.

45:42.918 --> 45:45.117
He's not here.

45:45.237 --> 45:47.197
And where's the helmsman?

45:47.317 --> 45:48.877
He shouldn't leave the wheel like that.

45:48.997 --> 45:51.036
He must've gone stark, steering mad.

45:51.156 --> 45:54.156
Stark, steering mad!

45:54.276 --> 45:56.476
Oh, shut up, you. This is serious.

45:59.715 --> 46:01.595
Lie low.

46:02.794 --> 46:04.954
Here goes.

46:05.074 --> 46:07.553
Ah! Ah!

46:08.954 --> 46:11.953
- What was that?
- That was Mr Howett.

46:17.151 --> 46:22.071
- Sir, what happened?
- They took us by surprise.

46:23.071 --> 46:25.070
All is lost.

46:25.190 --> 46:27.230
It's up to you...

46:27.350 --> 46:29.590
Save the Captain.

46:29.710 --> 46:32.589
Take boat... Oh-ah...

46:33.709 --> 46:35.429
Sir, you can depend on me.

46:35.549 --> 46:37.629
- Did you hear that?
- No. What?

46:37.749 --> 46:43.587
He said, "All is lost. Took us by surprise!
Save the boat and help the Captain!"

46:43.707 --> 46:46.387
No! Save the Captain,
take the boat, you fool!

46:46.507 --> 46:48.266
Save the Captain,
take the boat, you fool!

46:49.586 --> 46:51.026
- May I, Sir?
- Huh?

46:51.146 --> 46:52.106
- These?
- Yes!

46:52.226 --> 46:53.625
Thank you.

46:53.745 --> 46:55.505
You get the boat. I'll get the Captain.

46:55.625 --> 46:57.145
Wait a minute!

46:57.265 --> 46:58.625
He never said which boat.

47:00.984 --> 47:03.823
Captain... Captain Fearless!

47:04.783 --> 47:06.103
You all right, sir?

47:07.983 --> 47:10.662
It's locked. Am I too late?

47:19.941 --> 47:22.021
I'm coming in to get you, sir!

47:24.700 --> 47:27.099
It's all right, sir. Sir, it's only me.

47:27.219 --> 47:28.860
What was going on?
What was that shot?

47:28.980 --> 47:30.019
There's not a moment to lose, sir.

47:30.139 --> 47:33.098
We've been taken by surprise. All is lost.
I'm to get you away in the boat.

47:33.218 --> 47:34.218
Come on, sir.

47:34.338 --> 47:36.338
It's no good. You'll have to go without me.

47:36.458 --> 47:37.818
My foot...

47:37.938 --> 47:40.177
- Are you wounded?
- Yes, a dirty, great splinter.

47:40.297 --> 47:42.417
I always said we needed carpets
in these cabins.

47:42.537 --> 47:45.096
- You've got to make it, sir.
- All right. I'll try.

47:45.216 --> 47:47.376
That's the stuff, sir.

47:47.496 --> 47:49.775
- I'll go ahead and see the coast is clear.
- Yes.

47:49.895 --> 47:51.495
Oh-Oh!

48:11.212 --> 48:13.331
Oh, no...not again.

48:16.051 --> 48:18.251
- What's happening, sir?
- I don't know.

48:18.371 --> 48:20.890
All he had to do
was go in and get the Captain.

48:21.010 --> 48:22.490
How difficult can he make things?

48:22.610 --> 48:24.770
He's got even less sense
than we bargained for.

48:24.890 --> 48:26.210
Shh.

48:31.408 --> 48:33.328
Oh, who left that there?

48:34.568 --> 48:36.207
Where's the boat? Where's the...?

48:42.366 --> 48:45.206
Everything's all right. They're only dead.

48:45.326 --> 48:46.966
Oh... Ah!

48:47.086 --> 48:49.405
Albert! Albert!

48:51.085 --> 48:53.325
- Where's the boat? Where's the boat?
- Up there.

48:53.445 --> 48:54.924
Well, lower it over the side!

48:55.044 --> 48:58.844
- I can't. There's another one in the way.
- Then we'll take that one!

48:58.964 --> 49:00.003
Come on, Albert.

49:05.323 --> 49:07.762
Wait! Women and children first.

49:07.882 --> 49:09.402
But there aren't
any women and children.

49:09.522 --> 49:10.722
Oh, excellent.

49:13.081 --> 49:15.761
- Here, Walter, help him.
- Of course.

49:26.759 --> 49:29.438
Pull away! Pull away!

49:31.038 --> 49:33.677
Stab me vitals, I thought they'd never go!

49:33.797 --> 49:36.677
Me, too. They'll be all right.
It's quite a pull to the mainland.

49:36.797 --> 49:40.036
Well, they've got plenty to drink.
We saw to that, didn't we, eh?

49:40.156 --> 49:42.436
Yes, sir.

49:52.434 --> 49:53.674
I didn't put it in!

49:53.794 --> 49:56.593
Somebody must have.
Cows don't get into boats by themselves!

49:56.713 --> 50:00.833
What does it matter who put it in?
At least we'll have something to drink.

50:00.953 --> 50:04.312
Exactly. Probably Mr Howett did,
as a last gallant gesture.

50:04.432 --> 50:09.591
I must remember to put that in my report.
"Saved cow before himself."

50:09.711 --> 50:12.471
Sir, don't you think
it's time we took stock of our position?

50:12.591 --> 50:15.070
- Why?
- Well, it's usual, sir.

50:15.190 --> 50:17.070
We haven't got a compass or a chart!

50:17.190 --> 50:19.149
No need to worry about that.

50:19.269 --> 50:22.629
Back on the Venus, I
had our position pinpointed exactly.

50:22.749 --> 50:23.708
Where were we?

50:23.828 --> 50:26.868
If we sail east north-east, by the sun,

50:26.988 --> 50:29.788
we should hit the coast
somewhere around Littlehampton.

50:29.908 --> 50:33.107
I've always wanted to go there.
All that lovely sand!

50:33.227 --> 50:37.707
But we haven't got buckets and spades!
And I've got none of those little flags!

50:37.827 --> 50:39.626
Now, now! No hysteria!

50:39.746 --> 50:41.666
We must save our strength
and not panic.

50:41.786 --> 50:45.585
Try not to think that we're alone on a
shark-infested ocean with nothing to eat,

50:45.705 --> 50:49.904
hundreds of miles from land,
and right off the shipping lanes...

50:50.024 --> 50:52.263
Help! Help!

50:52.383 --> 50:56.063
Somebody, save us! Save us!

50:58.142 --> 51:03.022
As you know, the Captain had to leave us
somewhat unexpectedly last night.

51:05.821 --> 51:09.821
And, unfortunately, I've had
to take over command of the ship.

51:09.941 --> 51:11.580
Hooray!

51:12.420 --> 51:17.339
Now, I know you want a fight... and,
by heaven, I'm going to see you get one!

51:18.739 --> 51:21.898
I've got a plan
that could end this damn war in one blow!

51:22.018 --> 51:23.938
Hooray!

51:24.058 --> 51:26.618
- Are you with me?
- Aye!

51:49.534 --> 51:51.293
Argh!

51:52.493 --> 51:53.573
I missed it.

51:54.412 --> 51:58.492
I missed it.
It was a great big fat juicy fly, it was.

51:58.612 --> 52:01.611
They're delicious
cooked over a low candle,

52:01.731 --> 52:03.771
with a touch of hollandaise on them.

52:03.891 --> 52:08.930
Oh, sir, we can't go on like this.
We've got to have some food.

52:09.050 --> 52:10.850
There's only one thing I can think of.

52:11.650 --> 52:14.609
Captain Coe's epic voyage
in an open boat.

52:14.729 --> 52:20.128
73 days.
Six of them set out, only three got home.

52:20.248 --> 52:23.768
- What did they live on?
- The three that didn't.

52:25.727 --> 52:28.647
Water. . .water...

52:29.326 --> 52:33.046
- Yes?
- Water...water...

52:33.166 --> 52:34.806
Yes?

52:36.445 --> 52:38.605
Not you. Water.

52:38.725 --> 52:39.965
There isn't none.

52:40.085 --> 52:43.284
How long have we been lying here
like this?

52:43.404 --> 52:46.003
Days and days.

52:46.123 --> 52:47.963
I can't last much longer.

52:49.403 --> 52:51.283
There's only one thing for it.

52:52.362 --> 52:54.723
Swim for it and get help.

52:54.843 --> 52:56.362
No, mustn't.

52:56.482 --> 52:58.361
Too risky... Sharks.

52:58.481 --> 53:01.081
Can't just lie here and watch you die.

53:01.201 --> 53:05.360
You'd do it for me,
after all I've done to you?

53:06.880 --> 53:09.240
- Goodbye.
- Good luck.

53:18.038 --> 53:19.998
Just my luck - the tide's out!

53:21.838 --> 53:24.397
Tide...? It's land!

53:24.517 --> 53:27.756
- We're saved. It's land. Over there!
- Land!

53:27.876 --> 53:29.876
- Come on!
- It's land!

53:29.996 --> 53:31.356
Land!

53:34.355 --> 53:36.195
Land! It's land!

53:37.435 --> 53:38.674
Saved!

53:40.274 --> 53:42.594
Sand, sand, beautiful sand.

53:42.714 --> 53:48.153
I don't wish to boast, but if it hadn't been
for my extensive knowledge of the winds,

53:48.273 --> 53:52.193
currents, tides and so on -
naval know-how, you might say -

53:52.313 --> 53:54.312
we wouldn't be here in Littlehampton.

53:54.432 --> 53:58.791
- We're very grateful to you, sir.
- Don't mention it, young man.

53:58.911 --> 54:01.191
- Where are you going?
- To fetch Mrs Fearless...

54:01.311 --> 54:02.631
I mean, Emma, the cow.

54:02.751 --> 54:06.470
- Come on, let's find some water.
- Water? We've had quite enough of that.

54:06.590 --> 54:11.949
Come on, Emma. Come on, Emma.
This is Littlehampton. You're home.

54:12.069 --> 54:15.908
Here she is!

54:22.187 --> 54:24.866
Here we are. Terra firma at last.

54:24.986 --> 54:26.627
- You said it was Littlehampton.
- It is.

54:26.746 --> 54:29.545
- Listen, someone's coming!
- Quick, hide!

54:29.665 --> 54:31.985
What for? They're friendly.
I've got an aunt...

54:32.105 --> 54:34.265
Don't chatter. Come on.

54:34.385 --> 54:37.264
- But my Aunt Lil's...
- Shut up. Shh!

54:45.463 --> 54:46.983
Which one is your auntie?

54:50.422 --> 54:52.382
- "Littlehampton".
- Well, how was I to know?

54:52.502 --> 54:54.421
Keep down. They might not see us.

54:54.541 --> 54:57.021
They're taking all their clothes off.

54:57.141 --> 55:01.380
- I think they're going to bathe, sir.
- Bathe? How disgusting.

55:01.500 --> 55:05.659
I can't understand what a lot of Spaniards
are doing bathing in Littlehampton.

55:05.779 --> 55:08.579
- We're in Spain, you fool!
- Oh, that's all right, then.

55:08.699 --> 55:10.458
Isn't it marvellous?

55:10.578 --> 55:13.658
We'd better worry because if that lot
catch us, it's the Inquisition!

55:13.778 --> 55:16.258
- The inky-what?
- The Inquisition. The torture!

55:16.377 --> 55:18.377
They're a rough lot, these Spaniards.

55:18.497 --> 55:20.776
They get you on that rack
and start stretching you.

55:20.896 --> 55:24.376
They start stretching you
right out like that. They go to any lengths.

55:24.496 --> 55:27.975
Then they get your hands in a vice
and start turning a great big wheel.

55:28.095 --> 55:30.615
And then it's crushing your head
and off with your head,

55:30.735 --> 55:32.855
as they're touching you up
with a big red hot...

55:32.975 --> 55:35.174
Please. Please!
Not on an empty stomach.

55:35.294 --> 55:37.174
But they haven't caught us yet.

55:37.294 --> 55:39.733
If we could get to the north coast
of France, we'd have a chance.

55:39.853 --> 55:43.013
- Dressed like this?
- We could take our uniforms off.

55:43.133 --> 55:45.573
Yes, we could... Oh, no, you couldn't.

55:47.212 --> 55:48.892
Not unless we could get
some other clothes.

55:58.810 --> 56:01.250
I don't like the idea
of leaving Emma behind.

56:01.370 --> 56:03.810
- Spain's full of bulls. She'll love it.
- Love what?

56:03.929 --> 56:05.969
- Bull.
- I hope so.

56:06.089 --> 56:08.408
She'd be a stupid cow if she didn't.

56:13.888 --> 56:17.526
Yes, that's Cadiz all right.

56:17.646 --> 56:19.167
Any ships in, sir?

56:20.206 --> 56:23.566
Not one.
The whole Spanish fleet must be at sea.

56:25.445 --> 56:27.445
This is going to be easier than I thought.

56:27.565 --> 56:31.724
There'll be batteries each side
of the harbour. Shall I douse the lights?

56:31.844 --> 56:36.924
Why look for trouble?
Just run up the Spanish flag.

56:37.044 --> 56:39.203
- Huh?
- Aye aye, sir.

56:40.363 --> 56:43.122
Thank you, Midshipman Poop-Decker.
That is much better.

56:43.242 --> 56:45.322
That's all right, sir.

56:45.442 --> 56:49.522
I must say, you make
a remarkably good woman. Doesn't he?

56:49.642 --> 56:52.601
- Oh, yes. Very life-like, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

56:52.721 --> 56:56.040
Mind you, I think you've overdone
the padding a little here and there.

56:56.160 --> 57:00.039
You don't want to attract
too much attention. If you'll allow me...

57:00.159 --> 57:04.359
Hey! I think we should be pushing along.
We've got a long way to go.

57:04.479 --> 57:08.118
Nonsense. We're well into France
by now. Well into France.

57:08.238 --> 57:11.077
- Come along, sir. On your feet.
- Oh, very well.

57:25.835 --> 57:29.794
That's fine. They won't get close enough
to get a good look at it.

57:29.914 --> 57:31.234
Just as you say, sir,

57:31.354 --> 57:33.633
but I think it would be better
to leave one of the men aboard.

57:33.753 --> 57:38.113
No. We might run into trouble ashore.
We shall need every man we can find.

57:38.233 --> 57:40.712
- Now, get them into the boats.
- Aye aye, sir.

57:46.111 --> 57:48.111
Look, sir, a harbour!

57:48.231 --> 57:51.150
- Do you know what it is, sir?
- Of course. It's Le Havre.

57:51.270 --> 57:55.069
'Ere...that looks like
old Venus down there.

57:55.189 --> 57:57.949
By Jove, you're right.

57:58.069 --> 58:00.389
It must've been the French
who captured her.

58:00.509 --> 58:05.348
Sir, wouldn't it be wonderful if we could
get aboard and take her back to England?

58:05.468 --> 58:07.268
Er...l don't think they'd like that.

58:07.388 --> 58:10.747
No, I think we'll just look around
for a small rowboat or something.

58:10.867 --> 58:12.627
It's our duty to try and get her back.

58:12.747 --> 58:14.666
Think what it would mean
for England, sir.

58:14.786 --> 58:17.786
Well, if you could do it
without managing to upset anyone.

58:17.906 --> 58:20.665
We don't want any unpleasant incidents
with the French,

58:20.785 --> 58:23.504
especially now we're at war with them
as well as Spain.

58:55.020 --> 58:57.578
Come on.

59:13.216 --> 59:15.176
Come on. Follow me.

59:46.570 --> 59:48.490
Well, well...

59:51.129 --> 59:53.809
You must be the Minister of War.

59:53.929 --> 59:56.648
I am Don Luis, the Governor.
Who are you and what do you want?

59:56.768 --> 01:00:00.608
Lieutenant Howett of
His Britannic Majesty's frigate Venus, sir.

01:00:00.728 --> 01:00:01.928
Guards!

01:00:02.048 --> 01:00:04.487
You're wasting your time, I'm afraid,
Your Excellency.

01:00:04.607 --> 01:00:06.487
<i>They are hors de combat.</i>

01:00:06.607 --> 01:00:08.966
So is she by the looks of her.

01:00:09.086 --> 01:00:12.846
Mr Angel, take her outside
while I talk to His Excellency.

01:00:19.125 --> 01:00:20.685
What shall I do with her?

01:00:20.805 --> 01:00:22.764
- How long have you been at sea?
- 15 years.

01:00:22.884 --> 01:00:25.163
Well, don't ask stupid questions!

01:00:25.923 --> 01:00:27.403
Aye aye, sir.

01:00:28.683 --> 01:00:30.603
And now, Your Excellency...

01:00:31.762 --> 01:00:35.762
Before you get any rash ideas,
I should look through this window.

01:00:39.361 --> 01:00:44.200
There you'll see my ship, with a cannon
loaded and trained on your palace here.

01:01:01.637 --> 01:01:04.717
You appear to have me
at a disadvantage, Lieutenant.

01:02:00.507 --> 01:02:04.226
- Oh! Albert, what happened?
- It came off in my hand.

01:02:06.346 --> 01:02:09.225
It's all right, sir. It's only a dummy.

01:02:09.345 --> 01:02:12.625
Oh, never mind him.
Albert, you and Walter pull up the anchor.

01:02:12.745 --> 01:02:14.104
I'll take the wheel.

01:02:14.224 --> 01:02:19.104
This is just your order for the surrender
of Cadiz and the entire Spanish fleet.

01:02:19.224 --> 01:02:22.303
- That is all.
- That is all?

01:02:22.423 --> 01:02:23.623
- I cannot do it.
- Right!

01:02:23.743 --> 01:02:24.943
No, wait.

01:02:26.663 --> 01:02:28.262
Let me think for a moment, please.

01:02:28.902 --> 01:02:30.982
- Are we clear, Albert?
- Yes.

01:02:32.062 --> 01:02:36.021
Look, that cannon's loaded
and it's pointing right at the town.

01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:38.900
It seems a pity to waste it, eh?

01:02:44.219 --> 01:02:47.179
Now, sit down and sign.

01:02:52.017 --> 01:02:54.337
Blow for luck... Thank you.

01:02:54.457 --> 01:02:57.977
Sign, Your Excellency, or I'll shoot.

01:03:16.973 --> 01:03:20.533
Lost? Of course I'm not lost, Sweetly.
What are you talking about?

01:03:20.653 --> 01:03:24.772
I was only asking, sir, cos, you see,
when we left Lee Haver...

01:03:24.892 --> 01:03:28.692
- "Lee Haver"?
- You know. That French place.

01:03:28.812 --> 01:03:30.251
Oh, Le Havre.

01:03:30.371 --> 01:03:31.731
- That's right.
- Well?

01:03:31.851 --> 01:03:35.770
When we left there,
you said we'd be in England by morning.

01:03:35.890 --> 01:03:40.129
- Well, what about it?
- Well, that was four clays ago.

01:03:44.208 --> 01:03:47.048
Albert, I've been checking up
on the charts.

01:03:47.168 --> 01:03:49.568
You know that place
we started out from - Le Havre?

01:03:49.688 --> 01:03:51.927
- Yes.
- It was Cadiz.

01:03:52.847 --> 01:03:56.086
Cadiz? But the Captain said
it was Le Havre!

01:03:56.206 --> 01:03:58.886
I know. That's what started me worrying.

01:03:59.006 --> 01:04:01.725
Cadiz?
That means we're a long way from home.

01:04:01.845 --> 01:04:03.645
- Yes.
- Oh, dear.

01:04:03.765 --> 01:04:07.325
- Don't worry. We'll get there.
- Yes, I suppose so.

01:04:08.285 --> 01:04:10.644
I've been wondering why you came back.

01:04:10.764 --> 01:04:13.483
You said you were going to Spain
to find your sweetheart.

01:04:13.603 --> 01:04:15.244
- Don't you know?
- No.

01:04:15.364 --> 01:04:18.363
I suppose I suddenly realised
I didn't really love him.

01:04:18.483 --> 01:04:19.443
Oh.

01:04:19.563 --> 01:04:21.962
He just swept me off my feet.
After all, I was only 13.

01:04:23.362 --> 01:04:26.402
Do you mean he plighted your thingummy
when you were only 13?

01:04:26.522 --> 01:04:27.921
Yes.

01:04:28.041 --> 01:04:29.721
Dirty rotten plighter.

01:04:29.841 --> 01:04:33.400
It doesn't matter now.
I'm just glad I met you in time.

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:35.240
- In time for what?
- Oh, Albert.

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:36.799
Do I have to hit you
over the head again?

01:04:36.919 --> 01:04:37.920
No.

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.359
I love you.

01:04:40.879 --> 01:04:42.558
You love me?

01:04:42.678 --> 01:04:46.558
That's wonderful because I love me, too...
I mean, I love you, too.

01:04:51.437 --> 01:04:53.157
It's time I had my wound dressed.

01:04:53.277 --> 01:04:55.396
Where's Midshipman Poop-Decker?

01:04:55.516 --> 01:04:57.796
He's down on the main deck, sir,
with Albert.

01:04:57.916 --> 01:04:59.595
Where?

01:05:01.196 --> 01:05:04.114
I may like to run a happy ship,
but this is ridiculous.

01:05:04.234 --> 01:05:05.474
Midshipman Poop-Decker!

01:05:06.475 --> 01:05:07.474
" Yes?
" Yes?

01:05:07.594 --> 01:05:09.474
Report to the poop deck immediately!

01:05:14.673 --> 01:05:17.112
There's nothing in here to cover it.

01:05:19.032 --> 01:05:20.791
- Sir?
- Really, Poop-Decker!

01:05:20.911 --> 01:05:22.231
I don't know what to say.

01:05:22.351 --> 01:05:25.991
Sir, if it's about us kissing just now,
it's all right, sir.

01:05:26.111 --> 01:05:28.911
What do you mean it's all right?
How can it be all right?

01:05:29.590 --> 01:05:31.790
- We're going to be married, sir.
- Married?

01:05:32.429 --> 01:05:34.749
I'm afraid
Albert didn't explain it very well, sir.

01:05:34.869 --> 01:05:39.309
You see, sir, I'm not really Midshipman
Albert Poop-Decker at all. No, I'm...

01:05:39.429 --> 01:05:42.148
Ship ahoy!

01:05:43.228 --> 01:05:46.308
I wish you wouldn't shout in my ear
like that.

01:05:47.787 --> 01:05:50.306
Beggin' your pardon, sir.
Ship ahoy.

01:05:50.426 --> 01:05:55.465
- Where?
- Roughly broad, on the left bow.

01:05:55.585 --> 01:05:58.945
Ah, yes, one of our luggers
on Channel patrol.

01:05:59.065 --> 01:06:00.345
Are you sure, sir?

01:06:00.465 --> 01:06:03.225
Of course I'm sure.
Do you think I don't know a lugger?

01:06:03.345 --> 01:06:05.704
Give a signal for her to come alongside.

01:06:06.743 --> 01:06:07.744
Aye aye, sir.

01:06:09.783 --> 01:06:11.823
An English frigate.

01:06:13.383 --> 01:06:16.622
Run up the flag, Hook.
Let's see what she does.

01:06:16.742 --> 01:06:19.302
Aye aye, Cap'n. Run up the flag!

01:06:22.021 --> 01:06:24.341
I hope she doesn't make
too big a fight of it.

01:06:24.461 --> 01:06:26.861
A ship like that would suit us fine.

01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:31.459
Aye, this one's a damn sight
too small for us, that's for sure.

01:06:33.019 --> 01:06:34.179
They're making a signal.

01:06:35.538 --> 01:06:38.698
They want us...to come...

01:06:40.178 --> 01:06:42.178
alongside?

01:06:42.298 --> 01:06:44.337
- They what?
- Could be a trap.

01:06:44.457 --> 01:06:47.697
Aye. They're a crafty lot all right,
the Navy.

01:06:47.817 --> 01:06:50.936
Well, we can be crafty, too.
Run down the flag, Hook.

01:06:51.056 --> 01:06:52.416
Get the grappling irons ready

01:06:52.536 --> 01:06:56.895
and tell the lads to stay out of sight
till we get alongside.

01:06:57.015 --> 01:06:58.175
Aye aye, Cap“-

01:06:59.455 --> 01:07:02.214
- Down here, sir?
- Yes, about there.

01:07:03.894 --> 01:07:05.813
Easy does it.

01:07:05.933 --> 01:07:07.213
Ah, that's it.

01:07:09.053 --> 01:07:11.652
Now, we may be
a weary and depleted crew,

01:07:11.772 --> 01:07:15.332
but we must still welcome her Captain
aboard in a fitting and traditional manner.

01:07:15.452 --> 01:07:17.651
Yes, sir,
if you're sure it's an Englishman...

01:07:17.771 --> 01:07:19.851
Midshipman Poop-Decker,
don't interrupt.

01:07:19.971 --> 01:07:25.210
Where was I? As they come alongside,
we'll give them three rousing cheers.

01:07:27.129 --> 01:07:29.010
Here they come.
Have you got your call ready?

01:07:29.130 --> 01:07:30.129
Yes, sir.

01:07:30.249 --> 01:07:32.929
After you've piped her Captain aboard,
I'll make a speech.

01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:36.168
Right, give them three hearty cheers.
Hip-hip...!

01:07:36.288 --> 01:07:38.008
Hooray!

01:07:38.128 --> 01:07:39.647
Argh!

01:07:45.327 --> 01:07:49.206
- That's not a patrol boat. They're pirates!
- Well, anyone can make a mistake.

01:07:55.485 --> 01:07:57.085
There she goes!

01:08:02.763 --> 01:08:05.883
And now...what are we going to do
with our prisoners, eh?

01:08:06.003 --> 01:08:11.042
If you don't mind me saying so, that was
foolish, sinking your own ship, I mean.

01:08:11.162 --> 01:08:12.162
Oh, you think so, do you?

01:08:12.882 --> 01:08:15.761
- Why?
- Well, how are you going to get home?

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:19.600
You haven't got the idea, mate.

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:22.399
This is our ship now.
How will you get home?

01:08:25.078 --> 01:08:27.158
What a sorry-looking shark.

01:08:27.279 --> 01:08:30.559
If this is the best the English can do,
heaven help them.

01:08:30.679 --> 01:08:34.078
You won't need that no longer, mate.

01:08:35.997 --> 01:08:37.037
How's that, lads?

01:08:37.997 --> 01:08:39.676
Who wants another hat?

01:08:41.317 --> 01:08:43.595
- It's a girl!
- A girl?

01:08:44.435 --> 01:08:46.756
My dear,
then you weren't overdoing the er...

01:08:46.876 --> 01:08:50.675
Well, this is really somethin', ain't it!

01:08:50.795 --> 01:08:52.635
Get your hands off her!

01:08:52.755 --> 01:08:54.754
Stand back, you dogs!

01:08:55.594 --> 01:08:57.194
What the devil is going on here, Hook?

01:08:57.314 --> 01:08:59.993
- One of the prisoners, Captain. It's a girl.
- What?

01:09:00.113 --> 01:09:03.393
- Roger!
- Roger...the lodger!

01:09:04.353 --> 01:09:06.471
I know that face...

01:09:06.591 --> 01:09:09.112
Rot my guts. Sally.

01:09:09.232 --> 01:09:11.191
Sally, from Dirty Dick's.

01:09:11.310 --> 01:09:14.430
You have grown into a handsome piece.

01:09:14.551 --> 01:09:18.910
Get back, you scum!
She's not for the likes of you.

01:09:19.029 --> 01:09:21.109
Come here. I'll take care of this one.

01:09:21.229 --> 01:09:24.429
- What about the rest?
- You know what to do with them, Hook.

01:09:24.549 --> 01:09:25.988
Aye, Captain.

01:09:26.429 --> 01:09:28.348
Run out the plank, lads!

01:09:33.827 --> 01:09:37.147
Roger. I hardly recognised you.
You've changed.

01:09:37.267 --> 01:09:39.307
Yes, you look a bit different yourself.

01:09:39.426 --> 01:09:42.265
Er...l thought you were
a prisoner in Spain.

01:09:42.386 --> 01:09:44.946
No, I deserted in Morocco.

01:09:45.066 --> 01:09:48.265
I find piracy much more to my taste
than the dratted Navy.

01:09:48.385 --> 01:09:51.425
Especially when I can take
prizes like you. Come, wench!

01:09:51.545 --> 01:09:55.704
Oh, Roger, please, no!
I no longer love you. I love another.

01:09:55.824 --> 01:09:57.784
Love? Who cares about love? Kiss me!

01:09:57.904 --> 01:09:59.463
No! I'll kill myself first.

01:10:00.143 --> 01:10:01.943
But you're mine.
We promised each other.

01:10:02.063 --> 01:10:05.302
It's too late. I'll never be yours willingly.

01:10:05.422 --> 01:10:08.141
Damn Wench,
you'll be mine willingly or else...

01:10:08.261 --> 01:10:10.381
Do you want to see the fun?

01:10:10.501 --> 01:10:12.901
No! Yes...

01:10:13.981 --> 01:10:15.820
Yes, let's watch this together.

01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:18.300
It may make you change your mind.

01:10:21.499 --> 01:10:24.259
All right, you first!

01:10:42.256 --> 01:10:43.455
Well, get on with it!

01:10:44.096 --> 01:10:46.215
Does he want to make
a last-minute request?

01:10:46.335 --> 01:10:48.694
- Yes, I do, please.
- Well, what is it?

01:10:48.814 --> 01:10:51.494
- Could he show me how to do it?
- What?

01:10:51.614 --> 01:10:53.694
You see, I've never done it before.

01:10:53.814 --> 01:10:56.893
Perhaps your Captain
will be good enough to show you.

01:10:57.013 --> 01:11:01.013
Me? No, I'm terribly sorry.
I'm incapacitated. My foot, you know.

01:11:01.133 --> 01:11:03.492
What are these, men or mice?

01:11:04.492 --> 01:11:05.812
You, help him.

01:11:05.932 --> 01:11:08.411
Look, I've got just one thing
to say to you!

01:11:08.531 --> 01:11:09.491
Yes?

01:11:11.211 --> 01:11:13.090
I'll help him.

01:11:14.210 --> 01:11:16.769
- Piggyback, sir?
- Thank you, Albert.

01:11:23.168 --> 01:11:25.328
Bye-bye.

01:11:31.647 --> 01:11:33.086
Come on!

01:11:33.727 --> 01:11:36.686
- Are you all right, sir?
- Yes, thank you. You will be careful?

01:11:36.806 --> 01:11:39.205
- Don't drop me.
- I'll try not to, sir.

01:11:46.444 --> 01:11:47.604
No! Stop!

01:11:48.964 --> 01:11:50.324
Well?

01:11:50.963 --> 01:11:54.003
- Spare them and I'll be yours.
- Willingly?

01:11:55.083 --> 01:11:57.523
- Willingly.
- It's a bargain.

01:11:58.442 --> 01:12:00.322
Hook, put 'em in irons!

01:12:00.442 --> 01:12:02.802
All right. Come back, you two.

01:12:06.041 --> 01:12:08.840
Sally, I can't let you do it.
I'll kill the lot of them first!

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:10.440
You will, will you?

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:12.679
Argh!

01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:14.440
Oh! Oh!

01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:16.199
Don't just stand there! Get him!

01:12:17.799 --> 01:12:21.558
That's far enough! I'm warning you!
Thank you, Walter.

01:12:21.678 --> 01:12:25.397
All right. Come on. Come on, just try me.

01:12:25.517 --> 01:12:27.517
Come on!
What are you waiting for? Come on!

01:12:28.277 --> 01:12:29.517
What are you afraid of?

01:12:29.637 --> 01:12:33.037
You just try me. I'll cut you to pieces!

01:12:34.356 --> 01:12:36.276
Hang on, Albert. Hang on!

01:12:43.034 --> 01:12:46.873
Get after him, you fools!
He can't get away.

01:12:47.434 --> 01:12:49.673
Come on, get him, Hook!

01:13:06.830 --> 01:13:10.869
Damn you, use your pistols!
Shoot him down!

01:13:38.065 --> 01:13:39.664
Well, gentlemen,

01:13:39.784 --> 01:13:42.904
I'm sure you are anxious to know
why I have brought you to Corunna.

01:13:43.024 --> 01:13:44.024
To be shot?

01:13:44.144 --> 01:13:45.583
Of course.

01:13:45.703 --> 01:13:47.583
But first I wish you to have the pleasure
of seeing

01:13:47.703 --> 01:13:49.583
the great armada of Spanish ships

01:13:49.703 --> 01:13:51.503
assembled here to invade your country.

01:13:51.623 --> 01:13:54.782
How many ships?
And when do they sail?

01:13:54.902 --> 01:13:57.262
Five men-of-war. At dawn.

01:13:57.382 --> 01:13:59.021
I don't believe you.

01:13:59.141 --> 01:14:03.621
I did not think you would.
That is why I want you to see them.

01:14:04.660 --> 01:14:06.060
Captain, the guard.

01:14:48.213 --> 01:14:50.452
- Nice work, Mr Angel.
- Thank you, sir. What now?

01:14:50.572 --> 01:14:52.292
You heard what the man said.

01:14:53.532 --> 01:14:56.691
There are five ships ready
and waiting for us.

01:15:00.090 --> 01:15:03.370
Forward, men! Left-right, left-right...!

01:15:07.409 --> 01:15:11.009
- Land ahoy!
- Where away?

01:15:11.129 --> 01:15:14.008
Ten points off the port bow!

01:15:14.128 --> 01:15:15.848
- Mr Angel!
<i>-</i> AYE aye, sir?

01:15:15.968 --> 01:15:18.128
- Take the wheel.
- Aye aye, sir.

01:15:20.847 --> 01:15:22.087
Yes, it's England!

01:15:22.927 --> 01:15:26.126
- We've done it, sir. We've done it!
- Yes.

01:15:26.246 --> 01:15:28.245
All the way from Corunna
with five Spanish ships,

01:15:28.365 --> 01:15:31.085
and only four men to a ship.
How about that?

01:15:31.205 --> 01:15:33.085
Think of the prize money!
I can stay drunk for a year!

01:15:33.205 --> 01:15:35.364
Think of the glory.
We'll go down in history.

01:15:35.484 --> 01:15:38.404
The only men to capture five ships intact
without a shot being fired.

01:15:38.524 --> 01:15:40.804
I can't wait to sail this lot into Plymouth.

01:15:40.924 --> 01:15:43.123
We're flying the Spanish flag.
Will they fire on us?

01:15:43.243 --> 01:15:45.603
Oh, we've got identification pennants.

01:15:45.723 --> 01:15:48.962
We'll keep as far inshore as possible
and let them get a chance to see them.

01:16:04.039 --> 01:16:07.399
- Four points to leeward, helmsman.
- Four points to leeward, sir.

01:16:08.678 --> 01:16:09.878
Steady as you go.

01:16:12.198 --> 01:16:14.398
- Mr Sweetly!
- Yes.

01:16:14.518 --> 01:16:16.677
- Aye aye, sir.
- Aye aye, sir.

01:16:17.637 --> 01:16:20.037
That's better.
On the quarterdeck. Jump to it!

01:16:35.754 --> 01:16:37.713
- Yes?
- Aye aye, sir.

01:16:37.833 --> 01:16:39.593
Ave aye, sir!

01:16:39.713 --> 01:16:43.512
Good. Are all the guns primed,
loaded and ready to fire?

01:16:43.632 --> 01:16:44.752
Aye aye, sir.

01:16:44.872 --> 01:16:48.712
What's the good of having the guns
all primed and ready to fire anyway?

01:16:48.832 --> 01:16:50.751
- What's the good?
- Yes.

01:16:50.871 --> 01:16:54.111
Don't imagine for a moment
we're going to be taken by surprise again.

01:16:54.231 --> 01:16:57.110
If anyone tries to board us,
they'll get more than they bargained for.

01:16:57.230 --> 01:16:59.429
We won't get caught
with our gun ports down.

01:16:59.549 --> 01:17:02.589
Oh, if that's all there is,
I might get some sleep.

01:17:02.709 --> 01:17:05.428
- Take the wheel.
- Oh, have a heart, Albert.

01:17:05.548 --> 01:17:07.868
Stop calling me Albert!

01:17:08.668 --> 01:17:11.947
Acting Captain Poop-Decker, RN, sir,
with a hyphen.

01:17:17.066 --> 01:17:21.426
- Any orders for me, sir?
- Yes, um, aye aye. Um...

01:17:22.306 --> 01:17:23.785
- Check the guns...
- Aye aye, sir.

01:17:23.905 --> 01:17:25.465
- ...feed the prisoners...
- Aye aye.

01:17:25.585 --> 01:17:27.264
- ...attend to the Captain's foot...
- Aye aye.

01:17:27.384 --> 01:17:29.464
- ...and before you go...
- Aye aye?

01:17:29.584 --> 01:17:31.824
- Give us a kiss.
- Aye aye, sir.

01:17:35.024 --> 01:17:36.503
Cor...

01:17:37.383 --> 01:17:39.303
And all I get is the scrubbing.

01:17:42.022 --> 01:17:45.342
If this wind holds,
we'll be in Plymouth by sundown.

01:17:45.462 --> 01:17:47.661
Aye, just in time for a glass of rum.

01:17:47.781 --> 01:17:50.660
Don't get in too close.
There are some nasty reefs around here.

01:17:50.780 --> 01:17:53.780
Don't you worry, sir. Nothing can stop us
getting there now. Nothing.

01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:56.980
- Ship ahoy!
- Where away?

01:17:57.100 --> 01:17:59.779
South south-west.

01:18:03.858 --> 01:18:06.778
Yes, I see her. Looks like a frigate.

01:18:06.898 --> 01:18:10.457
- That's all right, then.
- Probably come to investigate us.

01:18:10.577 --> 01:18:12.496
Still, we don't want any mistakes.

01:18:12.616 --> 01:18:15.496
You'd better see
they're flying identification signals.

01:18:15.616 --> 01:18:16.576
Aye aye.

01:18:21.535 --> 01:18:23.335
- What's the trouble?
- Ssh!

01:18:24.295 --> 01:18:26.654
I thought
you ought to see him, Albert, sir.

01:18:26.774 --> 01:18:28.454
He seems to be in a permanent daze.

01:18:28.574 --> 01:18:29.574
He always is.

01:18:29.694 --> 01:18:32.693
No, it's more like a coma.
And look at his foot.

01:18:34.613 --> 01:18:37.092
- Eurgh!
- Should it be that colour?

01:18:37.212 --> 01:18:39.692
- I don't like it.
- No, I never did like green.

01:18:39.812 --> 01:18:41.291
You've got to do something.

01:18:41.411 --> 01:18:42.851
What do you expect me to do?
Bleach it?

01:18:42.971 --> 01:18:45.451
It's infected, Albert. It has to come off.

01:18:45.571 --> 01:18:48.411
- Yes, you're right. It's got to come off.
- Right away.

01:18:48.531 --> 01:18:49.810
Right away.

01:18:49.930 --> 01:18:51.810
You can do it. I know you can.

01:18:51.930 --> 01:18:53.210
Yes, I can...

01:18:54.090 --> 01:18:55.089
I can do it?

01:18:55.209 --> 01:18:59.369
You have to, Albert. You're the Captain.
It's your responsibility.

01:18:59.489 --> 01:19:01.529
If you don't, he'll die.

01:19:01.649 --> 01:19:04.927
Yes, of course you're quite right.
I've got to do it.

01:19:05.047 --> 01:19:06.407
I'm the Captain, you know.

01:19:06.527 --> 01:19:09.647
I've got nothing to worry about.
No need to worry about a thing.

01:19:09.767 --> 01:19:14.166
All you need is a steady hand...
and a keen eye.

01:19:16.646 --> 01:19:18.845
Where's the door? Where's the door?

01:19:20.485 --> 01:19:23.845
Come on... Walter. Walter!

01:19:26.444 --> 01:19:29.443
Walt... Walter. Look at him!

01:19:30.443 --> 01:19:32.003
Walter!

01:19:32.123 --> 01:19:34.243
Walter! Walter.

01:19:34.362 --> 01:19:36.083
Oh, I must've dropped off.

01:19:36.202 --> 01:19:38.401
Never mind that, Walter.
Lash the wheel and come below.

01:19:38.521 --> 01:19:41.881
Here, you called me Walter.
You haven't clone that for clays.

01:19:42.001 --> 01:19:44.081
All right! All right! Just lash the wheel!

01:19:44.201 --> 01:19:46.320
I need all feet to help
with the Captain's hands...

01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:50.000
I mean, I need all hands
to help with the Captain's feet. His foot.

01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:51.959
We'll need... What do we need?

01:19:52.079 --> 01:19:52.919
- A saw.
- A saw.

01:19:53.039 --> 01:19:54.359
- Saw.
- Saw?

01:19:54.479 --> 01:19:55.399
- Knife.
- Knife.

01:19:55.519 --> 01:19:57.638
- Knife.
- Knife...

01:19:57.758 --> 01:19:59.318
Oh, no, I mustn't start that.

01:19:59.438 --> 01:20:01.158
- Sail-maker's needle.
- Sail-maker's needle.

01:20:01.278 --> 01:20:02.517
Sail-maker's needle.

01:20:02.637 --> 01:20:04.158
- Oh, and thread.
- And thread.

01:20:04.278 --> 01:20:05.557
And Fr... Who's Fred?

01:20:05.677 --> 01:20:08.516
Yeah, who's Fred?
No, thread, you fool!

01:20:08.636 --> 01:20:09.396
Oh.

01:20:09.516 --> 01:20:11.836
And plenty of hot water.
Everything must be boiled.

01:20:11.956 --> 01:20:13.195
Come on.

01:20:14.836 --> 01:20:17.915
Boil everything?
Galley stove isn't working.

01:20:22.234 --> 01:20:24.554
- That's the old Venus.
- Are you sure, sir?

01:20:24.674 --> 01:20:26.954
Of course. I'd know her anywhere.

01:20:27.554 --> 01:20:30.153
- How can she have got here?
- I don't know.

01:20:30.273 --> 01:20:32.792
But if she doesn't alter course,
she'll come across our bows.

01:20:32.912 --> 01:20:35.272
Ah, she's bound to have spotted us.

01:20:36.992 --> 01:20:39.151
I'll make a signal
for her to give us sea room.

01:20:39.271 --> 01:20:44.111
Everything boiling, you said. And it will.
Cor, that's hot already!

01:20:47.629 --> 01:20:48.949
There we are.

01:20:49.390 --> 01:20:52.109
Ah...ah...where am I?

01:20:52.229 --> 01:20:55.068
It's all right, sir. You're all right.

01:20:55.188 --> 01:20:59.387
Oh, Mama. Mama, is it time to get up?

01:20:59.507 --> 01:21:01.467
Oh, he's delirious.

01:21:02.307 --> 01:21:07.267
Oh, Papa, what were you doing
with Nanny in the summerhouse?

01:21:07.387 --> 01:21:08.666
He's disgustingly delirious.

01:21:08.786 --> 01:21:11.665
Don't you worry.
We'll have you hopping about in no time.

01:21:11.785 --> 01:21:15.785
Don't let them send me to sea.
I don't want to go to sea, Mummy!

01:21:15.905 --> 01:21:19.624
- I won't, no.
- No, I don't want to go.

01:21:19.744 --> 01:21:21.664
I want a nice desk job.

01:21:21.784 --> 01:21:25.103
Yes, well, after this
you'll probably get one, sir.

01:21:27.543 --> 01:21:31.582
- Are they all right?
- I think so.

01:21:31.702 --> 01:21:33.982
- How long did you boil them?
- Four minutes.

01:21:34.102 --> 01:21:35.981
They'll still be soft.

01:21:38.781 --> 01:21:42.900
Oh, goody-goody! Daddy's going
to make me a rocking horse.

01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:44.700
Ooooo-aaa-oooh.

01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:47.699
Walter...hold his shoulders.

01:21:53.618 --> 01:21:55.058
- Ready, sir.
- What?

01:21:55.178 --> 01:21:56.178
Ready?

01:21:57.937 --> 01:21:59.457
Yes.

01:22:05.256 --> 01:22:07.295
This may hurt just a bit, sir.

01:22:15.934 --> 01:22:18.974
I don't understand it.
Our signals are clear enough.

01:22:19.094 --> 01:22:22.613
What's the matter with them?
Are they blind or something?

01:22:22.733 --> 01:22:23.853
Wait a minute.

01:22:25.613 --> 01:22:27.173
I can't see anybody.

01:22:28.332 --> 01:22:30.211
There's nobody on deck!

01:22:32.171 --> 01:22:34.891
Ahoy, there! Give way!

01:22:52.968 --> 01:22:55.128
- Albert...
- Ssh, don't interrupt me now.

01:22:55.248 --> 01:22:57.127
- But, Albert...
- Be quiet!

01:22:57.247 --> 01:22:59.287
I never thought it would be this tough.

01:22:59.407 --> 01:23:03.526
But, Albert,
you're sawing through the desk as well.

01:23:04.846 --> 01:23:06.845
Why didn't you tell me?

01:23:13.524 --> 01:23:15.044
We'll have to go about, sir!

01:23:15.164 --> 01:23:17.924
How? We'll be on the rocks if we do!

01:23:18.044 --> 01:23:19.923
What the hell's the matter
with the fools?

01:23:20.043 --> 01:23:21.562
Ahoy!

01:23:24.722 --> 01:23:27.722
Blister me tripes, they're on fire!

01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:35.960
- Here... Wait a minute...
- What is it?

01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:39.799
- I thought I could smell burning.
- At a time like this? Shut up.

01:23:39.919 --> 01:23:41.680
I'm sure I can smell burning.

01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:43.399
You can smell
whether you're burning or not!

01:23:43.519 --> 01:23:45.399
No need to be rude.

01:23:45.519 --> 01:23:47.638
I'm positive I can smell...

01:23:47.758 --> 01:23:48.758
Cor...

01:23:48.878 --> 01:23:51.518
- You made me miss it again.
- Here, use this.

01:24:04.476 --> 01:24:06.475
They're firing on us now!

01:24:06.595 --> 01:24:09.515
Hey, don't fire! We're on your side!

01:24:15.994 --> 01:24:20.313
- Here, what's all that noise about?
- It sounds like a battle.

01:24:20.433 --> 01:24:22.512
- What noise?
- Wait a minute. Listen.

01:24:30.991 --> 01:24:33.391
- That's thunder.
- Oh.

01:24:33.510 --> 01:24:35.190
Look, you've made me drop a stitch!

01:24:35.310 --> 01:24:38.029
- Oh.
- I shall have to unpick it.

01:24:39.229 --> 01:24:41.269
Put about!

01:24:41.389 --> 01:24:44.309
Put about! He's mad.

01:24:47.467 --> 01:24:50.267
All right, boys, abandon ship!

01:24:50.387 --> 01:24:51.827
Swim for it!

01:25:04.025 --> 01:25:07.184
There. That's it. It's finished.

01:25:07.304 --> 01:25:09.624
Oh, Albert, I'm so proud of you.

01:25:09.744 --> 01:25:12.504
Yes, it's a very neat job.

01:25:13.623 --> 01:25:14.903
Thank you.

01:25:15.983 --> 01:25:17.783
I need a breath of fresh air.

01:25:28.860 --> 01:25:32.540
- What happened?
- Albert, look!

01:25:33.779 --> 01:25:36.459
You were right. It was a battle.

01:25:42.098 --> 01:25:44.298
I'm glad we didn't get mixed up in it.

01:25:45.498 --> 01:25:49.737
Oyez! Hear all about it!

01:25:51.137 --> 01:25:59.015
"Spanish invasion fleet completely
destroyed off Cornwall by single frigate!"

01:25:59.135 --> 01:26:00.255
Oyez!

01:26:02.415 --> 01:26:06.174
In recognition of your gallant action
against overwhelming odds,

01:26:06.294 --> 01:26:10.733
His Majesty hereby confers on you
all the Freedom of the City of London.

01:26:12.013 --> 01:26:15.652
And a life pension
for you and your families

01:26:15.772 --> 01:26:17.812
of seven shillings and sixpence a year.

01:26:17.932 --> 01:26:20.971
- Seven and sixpence! Thank you.
- Thank you, my lord.

01:26:21.091 --> 01:26:23.691
But that is not all, gentlemen.

01:26:23.811 --> 01:26:27.410
Midshipman Poop-Decker
and Able Seaman Sweetly...

01:26:27.530 --> 01:26:31.609
you are henceforth granted the rank
of Honorary Captains.

01:26:31.729 --> 01:26:32.969
That's very nice of you, my lord.

01:26:33.089 --> 01:26:35.529
Thank you very much,
but I'm giving up the sea.

01:26:35.649 --> 01:26:38.049
- Yes, well... What was that?
- He's giving up the sea.

01:26:39.288 --> 01:26:41.768
- We're going to be married.
- Bless my soul!

01:26:43.568 --> 01:26:45.007
Captain Fearless,

01:26:45.127 --> 01:26:49.246
I trust you will accept the rank of admiral
and a permanent desk here.

01:26:49.366 --> 01:26:53.445
A desk here, my lord? I'm overwhelmed.

01:26:53.565 --> 01:26:55.845
That's the second desk job he's had
this week, sir.
