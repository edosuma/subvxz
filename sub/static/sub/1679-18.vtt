00:00.200 --> 00:03.900
Kids, in the spring of 2007, everything
was great between me and Robin.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.500
So we decided to try
and make it even better.

00:06.600 --> 00:08.500
We decided to move in together.

00:08.500 --> 00:10.400
So, I can have the moving
truck here by 8:00 am.

00:10.400 --> 00:11.800
Does that sound
good to everybody?

00:12.800 --> 00:14.900
By the way,
what are you guys doing with Ted's room?

00:14.900 --> 00:16.800
'Cause if you need help with the rent,
I'll take it.

00:16.900 --> 00:18.600
Why would you want
to live with us?

00:18.700 --> 00:21.100
I don't call what
you guys do "living."

00:21.700 --> 00:25.400
Here's the deal,
I need a room closer to the bar.

00:25.500 --> 00:27.900
It takes me exactly 23 minutes

00:27.900 --> 00:30.600
to get a girl from the
bar back to my apartment.

00:30.800 --> 00:33.200
A lot can go wrong
in 23 minutes.

00:33.400 --> 00:38.100
This is going to be so hot.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.100
She's paying.

00:47.800 --> 00:50.900
I swear,
if he doesn't call me back,

00:50.900 --> 00:52.300
I'm going to go
through with this.

00:52.300 --> 00:53.500
Please hurry, sir.

00:53.500 --> 00:55.700
I want to do dirty
stuff with you.

00:55.800 --> 00:58.000
Stuff I won't let him do.

00:58.100 --> 01:00.400
Every red light run
is an extra $20.

01:01.400 --> 01:02.600
Baby?

01:02.600 --> 01:05.700
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
It was all my fault.

01:07.200 --> 01:10.100
I am so drunk.

01:11.200 --> 01:15.400
When I'm this drunk,
I go crazy!

01:15.500 --> 01:17.100
I bet you do.

01:17.200 --> 01:18.600
Check this out.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.200
What up NYPD?

01:24.800 --> 01:26.200
So close.

01:26.600 --> 01:30.200
See? If I had a room here all I
have to do is get them upstairs.

01:30.400 --> 01:32.200
Come on, guys. It'll be great!

01:32.200 --> 01:34.200
We'll come in after
you guys are asleep

01:34.300 --> 01:36.000
and I'll be gone
before you wake up.

01:36.100 --> 01:39.900
So, you get to have sex and we get to
wake some skanky girl up in the morning

01:39.900 --> 01:41.300
and kick her out?

01:41.400 --> 01:42.600
God, Lily.

01:42.600 --> 01:45.400
Some guy just told her that he loved
her then pretended to go to the bathroom

01:45.400 --> 01:47.800
and never came back
you can't make her a cup of coffee?

01:47.900 --> 01:49.200
Real nice.

02:04.700 --> 02:08.000
I put all your heavy jackets
in this box marked "winter."

02:08.100 --> 02:12.800
And all your colorful sweaters
in this box marked "Bill Cosby."

02:13.400 --> 02:16.200
Make fun,
but America loved that guy for a reason.

02:17.400 --> 02:18.500
Wow!

02:18.500 --> 02:19.800
Almost done.

02:19.900 --> 02:21.200
Not so fast.

02:24.600 --> 02:26.100
Take your sword.

02:26.500 --> 02:27.800
Wow.

02:27.900 --> 02:29.800
- End of an era.
- Yeah.

02:29.800 --> 02:33.100
It's a bummer to break up the set,
but you're going to need that sword.

02:33.100 --> 02:36.200
It's true--
my building is infested with dragons.

02:37.900 --> 02:40.100
Looks like our little boy
is finally moving out.

02:40.400 --> 02:44.600
It seems like just yesterday
he was a cute little freshmen.

02:44.800 --> 02:47.700
Discovering Reggae
and ultimate Frisbee.

02:47.700 --> 02:50.200
He did it later than the other
kids but we never pushed him.

02:50.200 --> 02:51.700
We knew he'd get there.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.000
You haven't moved in yet,
have you?

02:54.100 --> 02:55.700
Good. You guys have
to take this quiz.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.100
I found it in a magazine.

02:57.100 --> 03:00.100
It's called the "Are you ready
to move in together?" quiz.

03:00.100 --> 03:03.100
Well, if it's anything like you're
"Are you wearing panties" quiz,

03:03.100 --> 03:04.400
I'm out.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.300
Question one,

03:06.300 --> 03:09.400
Ted, "Do you want to
move in with Robin?"

03:09.400 --> 03:10.300
Mm. Yes.

03:10.300 --> 03:12.000
Oh, you got the
first one wrong.

03:12.100 --> 03:15.100
The answer is "no," you
secretly want to be single

03:15.200 --> 03:17.300
and hang out with your
awesome friend Barney."

03:17.500 --> 03:18.700
Question two.

03:18.800 --> 03:22.800
Robin, "Do you think you can
score a hotter guy than Ted?"

03:23.600 --> 03:26.900
Correct. The answer
was awkward silence.

03:27.700 --> 03:32.700
Question three, "Did I just make
up this quiz to prove a point?"

03:32.700 --> 03:33.800
Yes.

03:33.900 --> 03:35.400
Yes, I did.

03:35.700 --> 03:40.100
Really? You mean it's not from
Old Yellow Legal Pad Magazine?

03:40.800 --> 03:43.000
So? We all agree?

03:43.100 --> 03:44.500
We move Ted's
stuff back up here?

03:44.500 --> 03:46.500
Mm... no.
We're still moving in together.

03:46.600 --> 03:48.900
Why? This is crazy.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.500
Ted you're throwing your life away.
This girl is blinding you.

03:51.500 --> 03:54.600
With her shiny hair and
her boobed shaped boobs.

03:55.500 --> 03:57.100
This is bad for you,
too, you know.

03:57.200 --> 04:00.300
How are you going to feel when
he sees you without any makeup?

04:00.300 --> 04:02.600
I'm not wearing
makeup right now.

04:02.700 --> 04:05.000
Holy crap, you're beautiful.

04:06.100 --> 04:10.200
All right then, how will you feel when
you can't sneak the occasional cigarette?

04:10.200 --> 04:12.900
Oh, come on,
Robin doesn't smoke.

04:13.300 --> 04:14.400
Wait, do you?

04:14.500 --> 04:16.200
Of course not. Why?

04:16.200 --> 04:18.200
Don't tell me how
to live my life!

04:19.200 --> 04:21.899
Ted, I can't let you do this.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.200
Come on. This is happening.

04:23.300 --> 04:26.000
So instead of fighting it why,
why don't you just help?

04:27.500 --> 04:29.200
- You want me to help you?
- Yeah.

04:29.900 --> 04:31.400
Okay, Ted.

04:33.100 --> 04:34.600
I'll help you.

04:35.900 --> 04:38.200
Can't believe we actually
got him to take a box down.

04:38.300 --> 04:40.400
Maybe he's finally
getting on board.

04:41.700 --> 04:43.100
Where's the truck?

04:44.400 --> 04:45.500
Where's Barney?

04:45.600 --> 04:47.300
Wait for it.

04:48.500 --> 04:51.600
I can't believe this! Everything
I own in the world is in there.

04:51.600 --> 04:54.500
Except for this
box of pot lids.

04:54.600 --> 04:56.100
And the sword.

04:56.600 --> 05:00.000
I'm going to kill him.
I swear to God I'm going to kill him!

05:00.000 --> 05:02.800
Right. Maybe I'll just hold on to that.
For now.

05:07.800 --> 05:10.900
Marshall, we live alone.

05:12.600 --> 05:14.400
This is so great!

05:14.800 --> 05:18.300
We can finally do all the things we always
said we wanted to do if we lived alone.

05:18.500 --> 05:20.800
Oh, I know what I
want to start with.

05:26.900 --> 05:28.500
So, here we are, right?

05:29.600 --> 05:31.800
Sitting around the
apartment naked.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.700
- Awesome.
- Yep.

05:38.900 --> 05:41.100
It's not as awesome as
I thought it would be.

05:41.100 --> 05:43.300
- My butt itches.
- I'm cold.

05:43.400 --> 05:44.700
I noticed.

05:46.300 --> 05:48.900
Yeah, like you're
one to talk, Pointy.

05:51.100 --> 05:53.500
Barney, I don't know if you
got my other 47 messages,

05:53.600 --> 05:56.300
but if my stuff isn't here within
the hour I'm calling the cops.

05:56.400 --> 05:58.500
This is the last time
I'm calling you.

05:58.700 --> 06:01.100
Because my charger's in
the back of the truck.

06:01.300 --> 06:03.900
Don't worry, it's Barney.
He'll bring the stuff back.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.500
No, it's just... I was really looking
forward to settling in, you know?

06:07.500 --> 06:09.200
Maybe setting up my TV.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.200
Watching a movie in bed.

06:12.500 --> 06:13.700
What?

06:13.900 --> 06:16.400
Do we really want a
TV in the bedroom?

06:17.000 --> 06:18.300
I thought we did.

06:18.400 --> 06:20.000
I'm not sure that we do.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.400
Well, where else
would we put my TV?

06:22.400 --> 06:26.000
We could just put it in our
storage unit in the basement.

06:26.300 --> 06:28.300
But wouldn't we miss my TV?

06:28.400 --> 06:30.600
- Would we?
- Yes, we would.

06:31.400 --> 06:33.300
We've had that TV
for a long time

06:33.300 --> 06:37.400
and we would feel more at home
if it were setup in our bedroom.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.500
- We need wine, don't we?
- Yes, we do.

06:48.700 --> 06:51.500
Should we, um,
move this to the bedroom?

06:51.600 --> 06:52.800
Why?

06:52.800 --> 06:54.800
Ted doesn't live here anymore.

06:54.900 --> 06:57.300
We can do it wherever we want.

06:57.400 --> 06:59.100
You know what else?

06:59.200 --> 07:01.200
We don't have to
be quiet anymore.

07:01.200 --> 07:03.500
We can be as loud as we want.

07:06.600 --> 07:09.600
Okay, I think we need to
lay down some ground rules.

07:09.800 --> 07:13.700
Just because we can be loud
doesn't mean we have to be loud.

07:13.700 --> 07:16.200
And although it
might turn you on,

07:16.300 --> 07:19.500
you screaming,
"I'm the best," doesn't do much for me.

07:19.800 --> 07:24.600
Well, it's a lot better than yelling,
"Ted's not here," over and over again.

07:24.700 --> 07:27.200
Well, at least what
I said is true.

07:29.100 --> 07:30.800
Well, that was unnecessary.

07:32.700 --> 07:36.600
Well, since I only have one box I
figure I might as well unpack it.

07:36.600 --> 07:37.900
Mm, where do you think
we should put it?

07:37.900 --> 07:40.900
Well, unless you have a separate pot
lid room, I was thinking the cupboard.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
What?

07:43.100 --> 07:45.300
Uh, the thing is my
kitchen is kind of small.

07:45.300 --> 07:47.700
And, um,
I already have a bunch of pot lids

07:47.700 --> 07:50.600
and mine come with pots, so...

07:50.700 --> 07:53.800
You're saying there's no way to make
room for the single box of stuff

07:53.800 --> 07:55.400
I try to move into our place?

07:55.500 --> 07:57.200
Well, why don't you just
take it down to the...

07:57.300 --> 07:58.900
Do not say storage space.

07:59.500 --> 08:01.300
I was going to say Dumpster.

08:01.800 --> 08:04.500
Damn it, Robin,
this is all I have left in the world--

08:04.500 --> 08:06.100
eight pot lids and a sword.

08:06.100 --> 08:08.700
Yeah, about the sword.

08:12.500 --> 08:13.400
Hello.

08:13.400 --> 08:15.600
Put on the suit, Mr. Mosby.

08:15.600 --> 08:18.100
Barney, I know it's you.
Where's my stuff?

08:18.200 --> 08:19.300
It's not me.

08:19.400 --> 08:21.500
If you want to see your
precious possessions again,

08:21.500 --> 08:23.100
put on the suit.

08:23.100 --> 08:24.000
What suit?

08:24.000 --> 08:27.400
Ding-dong. Oh, what's that?
The doorbell.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.700
That's the suit
I'm talking about.

08:30.800 --> 08:31.900
I haven't gotten
to the door yet.

08:31.900 --> 08:33.600
Oh, okay,
let me know when you get there.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.700
Okay, I opened it.
And there's a suit there.

08:37.700 --> 08:39.900
That's the suit
I'm talking about.

08:39.900 --> 08:41.900
- Barney....
- This isn't Barney.

08:41.900 --> 08:43.900
But I hear that guy's awesome.

08:44.400 --> 08:46.900
All right.
Listen very carefully.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
You will get your stuff back if you are
able to complete a series of challenges.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.600
Number one, put on the suit.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.400
Number two,
meet me at McClaren's in an hour.

08:56.500 --> 08:59.700
How will I know who to look
for since we've never met?

09:02.800 --> 09:04.500
I look like Barney.

09:09.200 --> 09:10.800
Oh, hey, Ted.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.800
Suit and sneakers.

09:12.900 --> 09:15.300
A little Ellen DeGeneres
but you pull it off.

09:15.300 --> 09:17.500
I don't have any other shoes
because you stole them along

09:17.500 --> 09:19.400
with everything else
I own in the world.

09:19.400 --> 09:20.900
Where's the truck, Barney?

09:20.900 --> 09:22.200
Barney.

09:22.300 --> 09:25.800
People's whose trucks I'm not
holding for ransom call me Barney.

09:25.800 --> 09:29.000
I think you should
call me The Commodore.

09:29.100 --> 09:32.800
- I'm not calling you...
- You're not getting your stuff back.

09:33.700 --> 09:35.800
Can I please have
my stuff back...

09:35.900 --> 09:37.600
The Commodore?

09:37.900 --> 09:38.800
No.

09:38.900 --> 09:41.600
Here's the deal,
Ted, you're my bro.

09:41.700 --> 09:45.100
And you're about to become a henpecked,
beaten down, shell of a man.

09:45.100 --> 09:51.300
So tonight, we are going to have one
last awesome night together as bros.

09:51.300 --> 09:53.300
It's a bro-ing away party.

09:53.300 --> 09:55.500
A special bro-casion.

09:55.500 --> 09:57.300
A bro-choice rally.

09:57.300 --> 09:59.100
Bro-time at the Apollo.

09:59.100 --> 10:00.500
Oh, bro me.

10:01.900 --> 10:03.400
Well, so what do I have to do?

10:03.500 --> 10:06.700
No, it's not what you have to do,
it's what you want to do,

10:06.800 --> 10:08.400
and you want to
have a good time

10:08.400 --> 10:11.500
before you go take Fun Ted
out back and shoot him.

10:11.600 --> 10:14.000
So... first thing
on the docket...

10:14.800 --> 10:17.000
- get me that girl's number.
- Absolutely not.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.500
Mm. That's too bad.

10:18.500 --> 10:21.400
Hey, hypothetical question:
if I was all your stuff,

10:21.400 --> 10:24.900
would I rather be at the bottom
of the East River or The Hudson?

10:28.500 --> 10:30.700
Hey, look,
world's strongest man is on.

10:31.200 --> 10:33.900
Ooh, it's the one where
Lou Ferrigno pulls the bus

10:33.900 --> 10:35.800
from the Partridge
family with his teeth.

10:35.900 --> 10:38.300
It's the best one.
Hey, Ted, get in...

10:43.700 --> 10:46.200
- We live alone.
- Yay.

10:48.500 --> 10:50.100
Well, I win.

10:50.200 --> 10:52.200
You need to give my
friend your phone number.

10:52.200 --> 10:55.900
Wow, I really didn't think Lou
Ferrigno could pull that bus.

10:55.900 --> 10:58.700
Are you sure this is live?
It looks pretty old.

10:58.700 --> 11:01.400
Yeah, that's 'cause the,
uh, TV is old.

11:04.400 --> 11:06.200
So, I'll, uh,
call you tomorrow?

11:06.200 --> 11:09.300
Yeah. Um, not too early.
I have church.

11:11.800 --> 11:14.000
You were impressive, buddy.

11:14.100 --> 11:15.900
Nice work.
All right, next challenge.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.700
No. No next challenge. Look, this is
my first night living with Robin.

11:18.700 --> 11:21.000
She's probably pissed I'm
spending it out with you.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.600
This might be our last hurrah,
my little friend.

11:27.800 --> 11:31.400
Marshall, I am gonna cook you
the best dinner of your life.

11:31.500 --> 11:33.700
How would you like a...

11:35.800 --> 11:39.500
one-egg omelet with
some ketchup and film?

11:39.900 --> 11:42.700
Guess Ted's the one
who did the shopping.

11:43.500 --> 11:45.800
Ooh, look, a microwave pizza!

11:48.900 --> 11:51.300
Guess the microwave
was Ted's, too.

11:51.600 --> 11:52.600
Yeah.

11:52.700 --> 11:54.600
So were all the towels.

11:54.900 --> 11:58.100
Turns out that everything that was
useful in this apartment was Ted's.

11:58.100 --> 12:02.100
Everything that was a Foghat poster we
bought ironically in college was mine.

12:02.900 --> 12:04.100
Marshall.

12:04.300 --> 12:05.500
Yeah, baby?

12:05.700 --> 12:07.300
I miss Ted.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.800
Is it too soon to call him?

12:10.000 --> 12:11.300
No, we shouldn't.

12:11.300 --> 12:14.500
I don't want to interrupt his
first night living with Robin.

12:16.300 --> 12:17.500
Ha, nice shooting.

12:17.600 --> 12:21.100
You know, if we win this one it's free onion
rings at the Intergalactic Snack Shack.

12:21.200 --> 12:22.100
What a bargain.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.100
We only had to spend
20 bucks a game.

12:24.200 --> 12:25.900
Admit it, you're having fun.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.100
Maybe.

12:27.200 --> 12:30.300
I mean, it was pretty funny when that
little girl fell over that space barrel.

12:33.200 --> 12:35.500
Nice... We win.

12:35.600 --> 12:39.700
Oh, walk of shame, walk of game--
what up?

12:39.800 --> 12:41.600
Okay. Let's go one more.

12:41.600 --> 12:44.000
- I don't know.
- You know you want to.

12:44.200 --> 12:46.800
All right, let's do it--
I just got to call Robin real quick.

12:46.900 --> 12:49.600
Oh, so that's what it's
gonna be like from now on?

12:49.600 --> 12:53.800
No. Okay, okay. You call your old
lady and ask permission to have fun.

12:53.900 --> 12:58.800
Me, I will be at the Snack Shack eating
our victory onion rings Han style.

12:59.100 --> 13:00.400
Solo.

13:06.500 --> 13:08.200
- Hey, Ted.
- Hey, sweetie listen,

13:08.300 --> 13:10.700
I'm really sorry but I'm gonna be
pretty late, so don't wait up.

13:10.700 --> 13:13.000
Oh, it's totally fine.
You do what you got to do.

13:13.100 --> 13:15.500
Thanks. You're the best.
I love you.

13:15.600 --> 13:17.400
I love you, too. Bye.

13:18.200 --> 13:20.800
Hey, sorry about that.
Thanks for holding.

13:20.800 --> 13:24.300
Um, so if you could go ahead and cancel
my subscription to Guns and Ammo,

13:24.400 --> 13:25.600
that would be great.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.500
No, it's a great magazine.
Really great.

13:28.500 --> 13:30.300
They've printed
three of my letters.

13:30.400 --> 13:32.000
It's just that my
boyfriend is moving in

13:32.000 --> 13:34.700
and he kind of doesn't approve
of the whole gun thing.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.800
A free hand grenade phone?

13:39.500 --> 13:42.100
You know what?
Let me give you my work address.

13:44.500 --> 13:46.000
I did it, baby!

13:46.100 --> 13:49.000
I got beer. I got food.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.900
We don't need Ted anymore.

13:50.900 --> 13:53.100
I am the provider of
this apartment now,

13:53.100 --> 13:54.800
and I have provided!

13:54.900 --> 13:57.000
"Provode"? Provided.

13:57.100 --> 13:59.000
Anyway, I got us
everything we need.

13:59.100 --> 14:02.000
Could you toss me
the toilet paper?

14:05.500 --> 14:07.700
Be right back, baby. Sit tight.

14:10.100 --> 14:13.800
Hey, I got to admit, um...
I didn't think I would, but, uh...

14:13.900 --> 14:15.700
I had a really
good time tonight.

14:16.100 --> 14:17.900
You're a good friend, Barney.

14:21.500 --> 14:23.100
Hey, man, why don't you, uh...

14:23.700 --> 14:25.500
why don't you tell me
where my truck is.

14:25.900 --> 14:27.500
No, I don't think so.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.100
Where's my truck?!

14:29.400 --> 14:33.000
Do you know why I haven't given you
any of your possessions back yet?

14:33.000 --> 14:36.900
Uh, because you're Admiral Jerk
of the British Royal Douchery?

14:37.500 --> 14:39.500
Because you don't
want them back.

14:39.600 --> 14:42.300
You could've left at any time tonight,
but you didn't, Ted.

14:42.300 --> 14:43.300
Why is that?

14:43.300 --> 14:45.600
Because I didn't want to go back
to Robin's without my stuff.

14:45.600 --> 14:47.800
False. You know what I think?

14:47.900 --> 14:51.200
I think you spent one day with
her and it already sucked.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.800
I think you didn't like being there,
she didn't like having you there

14:53.900 --> 14:56.900
and you both realized that
you made a huge mistake.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.100
And that's why you spent your
first night living with Robin

15:00.100 --> 15:01.700
out playing laser tag with me.

15:01.800 --> 15:04.000
And that's why
three seconds ago

15:04.100 --> 15:07.700
you didn't call it "my place"
or "our place" or "home,"

15:07.700 --> 15:09.700
you called it "Robin's."

15:12.600 --> 15:13.900
You know what?

15:14.100 --> 15:15.700
You can keep my stuff.

15:18.700 --> 15:21.200
- Hey.
- Hey, did you get the truck back?

15:21.200 --> 15:22.300
No.

15:22.300 --> 15:23.800
Why not? What happened?

15:23.900 --> 15:27.000
Oh, he pissed me off so much,
I left.

15:27.200 --> 15:30.800
Anyway, I just wanted to come back here,
space out and watch a movie.

15:31.900 --> 15:34.600
Do you anything that
wasn't made by John Woo?

15:34.900 --> 15:36.600
Why, do you?

15:37.700 --> 15:40.500
You know, forget the movie.
I just want to sit.

15:44.600 --> 15:45.800
What?

15:46.000 --> 15:48.200
It's just I eat at that table.

15:48.600 --> 15:50.600
Fine, I'll take my shoes off.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.700
You know, why don't you just
throw me down in the storage space

15:52.800 --> 15:53.900
where you have room for me.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.800
- Ted, come on.
- No, you come on.

15:55.800 --> 15:58.000
I had to jump through
hoops all night for Barney

15:58.100 --> 15:59.800
and then it took me an hour
to get home because his place

15:59.900 --> 16:01.700
is so far away from the bar.

16:02.100 --> 16:04.300
- Oh, my God.
- What?

16:04.500 --> 16:06.700
I know where Barney
put my truck.

16:10.600 --> 16:12.600
Let's go back to my place.

16:13.200 --> 16:15.600
I bet you my place is closer.

16:18.100 --> 16:19.500
Here we are.

16:19.800 --> 16:22.000
You live in the loading
dock behind the bar?

16:22.100 --> 16:25.100
I don't live here, baby.
This is just my ride.

16:27.500 --> 16:29.700
No, no, no, no.
I'm not getting into any van,

16:29.700 --> 16:31.700
I've seen Silence of the Lambs.

16:33.000 --> 16:39.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

16:42.200 --> 16:45.800
Oh, my God. We're drinking champagne
in the back of a moving van.

16:45.800 --> 16:48.100
Why, yes, Sara. Yes, we are.

16:48.100 --> 16:52.200
Those other Rockettes who
called you slow are crazy.

17:04.099 --> 17:06.800
Oh, my God. I knew it.
You're kidnapping me.

17:06.900 --> 17:08.500
- Help! Help!
- No, no, no, no.

17:08.500 --> 17:10.000
I can explain.

17:15.800 --> 17:16.700
Hello?

17:16.800 --> 17:18.700
Enjoying the ride?

17:18.800 --> 17:22.000
Ted? Ted, you let us out of here.
You let us out of here this instant!

17:22.000 --> 17:23.599
This isn't Ted.

17:23.700 --> 17:26.099
But I hear that guy's awesome.

17:31.900 --> 17:35.400
So I took Sara home and I took
Barney to a bar near his apartment.

17:35.500 --> 17:37.800
Apparently, that strategy
had never occurred to him.

17:37.900 --> 17:40.200
That poor girl must've
been so confused.

17:40.400 --> 17:41.300
Yeah.

17:41.400 --> 17:43.000
Well, at least Barney
learned a valuable lesson.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.400
You do not want to get scissor
kicked in the groin by a Rockette.

17:51.200 --> 17:54.000
So, uh,
I guess we should get you unpacked.

17:54.100 --> 17:55.300
Yeah.

17:55.700 --> 17:57.300
Yeah, I guess we should.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.200
Lily... deep within the
Amazonian rainforest,

18:03.200 --> 18:07.100
there is a type of tree that only grows
around the body of an existing tree.

18:07.500 --> 18:10.300
It cannot survive
without this tree.

18:10.300 --> 18:12.500
It is supported...

18:12.600 --> 18:14.100
by this tree.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.300
Lily, we are that tree.

18:17.400 --> 18:20.200
- The inside tree or the outside tree?
- The outside tree.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.500
- Shouldn't there be three trees?
- You and I are one tree.

18:22.600 --> 18:26.000
Okay, look, Lily,
the point is that we grew around Ted

18:26.000 --> 18:28.300
and without him,
we're slowly dying.

18:29.600 --> 18:31.100
What do we do?

18:33.400 --> 18:35.700
I think we can
marry each other.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
But we also have to marry Ted.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.400
I'll tell you right now, my Dad is
not gonna pay for that wedding.

18:44.300 --> 18:45.400
Ted!

18:45.500 --> 18:47.100
What are you doing here?

18:47.800 --> 18:50.100
Robin and I aren't gonna
move in together after all.

18:50.200 --> 18:51.700
What happened?

18:53.000 --> 18:54.900
I thought we decided
we were ready?

18:55.000 --> 18:56.400
I know.

18:56.800 --> 18:58.300
How did we come to that again?

18:58.400 --> 19:01.600
I don't remember.
We were fighting?

19:01.600 --> 19:03.800
- It's all so blurry.
- Yeah.

19:04.100 --> 19:06.600
The "let's move in together"
sex was pretty amazing.

19:06.700 --> 19:07.600
I know.

19:07.700 --> 19:10.800
I did that thing with no hands
I normally need both to do.

19:12.900 --> 19:16.200
You know...
I'm really happy with you.

19:16.200 --> 19:19.100
I really happy with you.
The way things are.

19:19.400 --> 19:20.900
Maybe we shouldn't
mess with that.

19:20.900 --> 19:22.700
I don't know that we should.

19:26.800 --> 19:32.300
Hey... I hear the "let's not move in
together" sex is pretty incredible.

19:33.400 --> 19:35.200
Let's go back to my place.

19:45.800 --> 19:48.000
- Ooh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

19:48.100 --> 19:49.900
- No, thank you.
- You'll be very happy.

19:52.900 --> 19:56.500
Look, I know you guys are really excited
about having the place to yourself.

19:56.700 --> 20:00.400
Until after the wedding, I mean,
if it's not too much of an imposition...

20:04.800 --> 20:07.700
God, this feels so right.

20:07.800 --> 20:10.000
Never leave us again.

20:12.900 --> 20:15.600
Guys, Robin's down in the truck and
there's actually a lot of boxes,

20:15.600 --> 20:17.100
so maybe we should...

20:23.100 --> 20:24.200
Do we have time for this?

20:24.300 --> 20:28.000
Ladies and gentlemen, I have in my
hand a copy of tonight's Top Ten list.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.400
The category: top ten things
I would've called my truck...

20:31.400 --> 20:32.200
It was never your truck.

20:32.300 --> 20:34.900
...if Ted hadn't been a
jerk and given it back.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.000
It was a rental.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.900
Number ten, "The Winne-Bango."

20:39.600 --> 20:42.200
Number nine,
"The Pick-Up Truck."

20:42.300 --> 20:45.500
Number eight,
"The Ford Explore Her."

20:45.900 --> 20:49.700
Number seven,
"The You Scream Truck."

20:50.200 --> 20:52.500
You Scream.

20:53.800 --> 20:56.700
Number six,
"Feels On Wheels." Hello!

20:56.700 --> 20:59.800
Number five,
"The Ride Her Truck."

20:59.900 --> 21:02.700
Number four, "The 18-Squeeler."

21:03.300 --> 21:06.500
Number three, "The Esca-Laid."

21:09.100 --> 21:12.400
Number two, "The Slam-Boney."

21:12.500 --> 21:15.200
and... the number one thing
I would've called my truck

21:15.300 --> 21:17.500
if Ted hadn't been a jerk
and given it back...

21:17.600 --> 21:20.100
"The '69 Chevy."

21:24.300 --> 21:25.700
Sorry.
