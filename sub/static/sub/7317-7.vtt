00:01.102 --> 00:02.172
Previously on "grey's anatomy..."

00:02.173 --> 00:03.602
I've had this thing
for my roommate since day one,

00:03.604 --> 00:08.108
and I can't tell her.

00:08.109 --> 00:10.410
Wouldn't it be easier
to just ask her out?

00:10.411 --> 00:13.443
Are really as shallow
and callous as you seem?

00:13.444 --> 00:16.146
Oh, you want to go out
for a drink later

00:16.146 --> 00:18.148
and hear about my secret pain?

00:18.149 --> 00:19.589
I can't. I'm seeing someone.

00:19.590 --> 00:21.121
Save yourself the misery, man.

00:21.122 --> 00:23.293
She's off the market. What?
But she's not.

00:23.294 --> 00:26.096
I live with her...
I would know it.

00:26.097 --> 00:28.158
And the longer
this little fling goes on,

00:28.159 --> 00:30.460
the more favors
you get over the others...

00:30.461 --> 00:32.302
Who are fighting tooth and nail

00:32.302 --> 00:34.464
just to make it
through this program...

00:34.465 --> 00:37.337
When those people start
finding out what's going on...

00:37.338 --> 00:40.170
What is this
that we're doing here?

00:40.171 --> 00:41.611
You need a definition?

00:41.612 --> 00:44.244
The next time I see you favoring
Meredith grey in any way,

00:44.245 --> 00:45.745
I'll make sure she doesn't see

00:45.746 --> 00:47.448
the inside of an O.R.
for a month.

00:52.323 --> 00:55.725
Okay, anyone who says
you can sleep when you die,

00:55.726 --> 00:57.487
tell them to come talk to me

00:57.488 --> 00:59.729
after a few months as an intern.

00:59.730 --> 01:02.732
Of course, it's not just the job

01:02.733 --> 01:05.194
that keeps us up all night.

01:05.196 --> 01:06.837
You have to get up now.

01:08.399 --> 01:09.399
What?

01:09.400 --> 01:13.072
Oh, my god, what time is it?

01:13.073 --> 01:17.147
It's 5:20, and I have prerounds.

01:17.148 --> 01:18.378
Ugh.

01:18.379 --> 01:19.779
And you have to leave
before they see you.

01:19.780 --> 01:21.711
Oh, come on, now.

01:21.712 --> 01:23.183
Why don't you just let them see?

01:23.184 --> 01:24.184
No!

01:24.185 --> 01:25.386
Please!

01:27.258 --> 01:29.289
You get any sleep?

01:29.290 --> 01:32.592
Oh, she could oil
the bedsprings as a courtesy

01:32.593 --> 01:35.266
or at least buy
a padded headboard.

01:36.427 --> 01:37.597
So, who's the guy?

01:37.598 --> 01:39.669
You think it was just one guy
doing all that work?

01:39.670 --> 01:41.601
Do you mind if
I don't think about that?

01:41.602 --> 01:43.102
Oh, jealous?

01:43.103 --> 01:44.534
I'm not jealous.

01:44.535 --> 01:46.206
I am.

01:46.207 --> 01:48.407
But at least I know she'll
be having a long day at work.

01:54.145 --> 01:57.217
♪ I wish I ♪

01:57.218 --> 02:00.651
♪ How I wish I ♪

02:02.523 --> 02:05.355
Well, at least we know brain
surgery isn't his only skill.

02:05.356 --> 02:07.297
They can't be... he's her boss.

02:07.298 --> 02:08.497
We're late.

02:08.499 --> 02:11.301
He's all of our boss.

02:11.302 --> 02:14.304
She has been scrubbing in
a lot lately on his surgeries.

02:14.305 --> 02:16.706
No, Meredith wouldn't sleep
with him just to... no.

02:16.707 --> 02:18.908
If she's not ashamed of it,
why is she keeping it a secret?

02:18.909 --> 02:20.370
Maybe she didn't.

02:20.371 --> 02:22.342
Maybe it just happened...

02:22.343 --> 02:26.216
You know, spontaneously,
last night.

02:26.217 --> 02:28.147
Hi. Good morning.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.849
Morning.

02:29.850 --> 02:32.752
It sounded like you were having
pretty radical sex last night,

02:32.753 --> 02:34.454
all night long.

02:34.455 --> 02:35.625
Who was the guy?

02:35.626 --> 02:36.757
No one you know.

02:38.389 --> 02:39.759
We're late. Let's go.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.861
I mean,
if life's so hard already,

02:41.862 --> 02:44.564
why do we bring more trouble
down on ourselves?

02:44.565 --> 02:47.567
The self-destruct button?

02:47.568 --> 02:50.340
Yikes, wouldn't want to
meet you in a dark alley.

02:50.341 --> 02:51.571
Right back at you.

02:51.572 --> 02:52.772
A run? You run?

02:52.773 --> 02:55.245
Every day, babe, every day.

02:55.246 --> 02:56.706
Not suffering enough?

02:56.707 --> 02:58.678
What doesn't kill you,
makes you stronger.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.680
Don't go acting
all indefatigable.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.712
You're dragging
like the rest of us.

03:02.713 --> 03:05.455
Oh, what is that...
Professional weakness, Dr. Yang?

03:05.456 --> 03:07.817
It's called the flu. Yeah.

03:07.818 --> 03:11.821
I need a major rush to make it
through this day.

03:11.822 --> 03:13.323
I need a kick-ass surgery.

03:13.324 --> 03:15.295
Ooh, you a bad boy
last night, George?

03:15.296 --> 03:16.896
That would be Meredith.

03:16.897 --> 03:19.369
You a bad boy, Meredith?

03:19.370 --> 03:21.200
Do tell.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.672
Nothing to tell.

03:22.673 --> 03:24.804
That says it all, huh?

03:24.805 --> 03:26.706
Sorry, I have a sex life.

03:26.707 --> 03:29.309
Don't apologize. Embrace it.

03:29.310 --> 03:30.680
Share it.

03:30.681 --> 03:32.642
Count me in.

03:32.643 --> 03:35.785
Next time, just let me know
if I need to go to a hotel

03:35.786 --> 03:37.447
so I can get some sleep.

03:37.448 --> 03:38.988
I.v. nurse, I.V. Nurse.

03:38.989 --> 03:40.320
Am I missing something?

03:40.321 --> 03:42.323
You were just a little loud.

03:44.895 --> 03:48.558
Do they know it's mcdreamy
keeping them up all night?

03:48.559 --> 03:49.559
I hope not.

03:49.560 --> 03:51.361
I already have Bailey riding me.

03:51.362 --> 03:53.363
I don't need
my roommates thinking

03:53.364 --> 03:55.366
I'm getting special treatment.

03:57.468 --> 04:02.472
O'Malley, Yang, Karev...
Go on to clinic.

04:02.473 --> 04:05.475
O'Malley, patients are waiting.

04:05.476 --> 04:07.317
You two come with me.

04:07.318 --> 04:09.248
Izzie, you're hanging
with me today.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.550
Good morning, Dr. Shepherd.

04:10.551 --> 04:11.552
Dr. Bailey.

04:15.326 --> 04:17.357
Late night, grey?

04:17.358 --> 04:20.329
No, caffeine just
hasn't kicked in yet.

04:20.331 --> 04:21.430
If you were at all religious,

04:21.432 --> 04:23.533
you would want to start praying
it kicks in soon.

04:23.534 --> 04:24.934
There's a consult in the pit.

04:24.935 --> 04:27.367
Girl with a fever
and abdominal pain.

04:27.368 --> 04:30.400
After that, Nicholas in 3311
needs his meds.

04:30.401 --> 04:33.272
Mr. moeller's I.V. Fell out,
and he's a hard stick.

04:33.273 --> 04:37.747
Post-ops in 1337, 3342,
3363, and 2381.

04:37.748 --> 04:40.350
381.

04:40.351 --> 04:43.453
3342, 3363,

04:43.454 --> 04:47.417
and 23...

04:47.418 --> 04:49.490
Why are you still standing
in front of me?

04:51.492 --> 04:53.593
You look more like me
than you right now.

04:53.594 --> 04:55.294
What's the matter? Nothing.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.296
Help! I need immediate help.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.368
What's the problem?

04:58.369 --> 05:00.870
My damn boyfriend
swallowed my keys.

05:00.871 --> 05:03.933
I didn't want her to leave.

05:03.934 --> 05:06.506
Locate the lady's keys.

05:06.507 --> 05:10.340
I think she got some bug on her
trip to Mexico with her friends.

05:10.341 --> 05:12.882
I told her not to go
to a third world country,

05:12.883 --> 05:14.414
but does she ever listen?

05:14.415 --> 05:17.387
She's been weak ever since,
and she's lost weight.

05:17.388 --> 05:18.588
Apparently.

05:18.589 --> 05:22.091
And this morning,
she passed out in the shower.

05:22.092 --> 05:23.553
When was the trip?

05:23.554 --> 05:25.324
A couple weeks ago.

05:25.325 --> 05:28.358
I'm really fine.
I just have a fever.

05:28.359 --> 05:32.061
Okay, well, will you lie back
for an exam for me?

05:32.062 --> 05:34.864
No, please,
I don't need an exam.

05:34.865 --> 05:38.468
Just give me some antibiotics,
send me home.

05:38.469 --> 05:39.939
Well, maybe it is just a fever,

05:39.940 --> 05:41.771
but they called down
for a surgeon,

05:41.772 --> 05:44.514
so I have to give the okay
to let you go.

05:44.515 --> 05:46.947
So just let me do the exam.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.521
Do the exam.

05:51.522 --> 05:52.523
No.

05:54.385 --> 05:56.556
This is crazy. I'm fine.

05:56.557 --> 05:57.927
For god's sake, Claire,

05:57.928 --> 06:00.590
I don't want to spend
my entire day here.

06:00.591 --> 06:02.992
You know, actually, Mrs. rice,

06:02.993 --> 06:06.436
this might be easier
if we had some privacy,

06:06.437 --> 06:09.539
so would you two mind
leaving the room?

06:09.540 --> 06:11.442
That's fine.

06:15.045 --> 06:17.448
Digby... digby Owens.
I have an appointment.

06:20.551 --> 06:22.452
Excuse me, sir...
Uh, you're bleeding.

06:22.453 --> 06:23.913
You mind if I...

06:23.914 --> 06:26.556
Sure, sure. Have a look.

06:26.557 --> 06:28.117
That's a gunshot. Yeah.

06:28.118 --> 06:29.519
We got a gunshot wound.

06:29.520 --> 06:31.621
We got to get him down
to the pit.

06:31.622 --> 06:32.622
Sit.

06:32.623 --> 06:33.923
Mr., uh... digby.

06:33.924 --> 06:36.395
All right, but it isn't
an emergency.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.528
I scheduled it.
What, the gunshot?

06:38.529 --> 06:39.929
Yeah. My buddy shot me.

06:39.930 --> 06:41.801
Buddy? Yeah, just as a favor.

06:41.802 --> 06:43.172
On purpose? Hell, yeah.

06:43.173 --> 06:44.834
He wasn't trying to hurt me
or nothing, but you know...

06:44.835 --> 06:46.075
But why?

06:46.076 --> 06:48.178
I like the scars.

06:55.145 --> 06:59.048
♪ Nobody knows
where they might end up ♪

06:59.049 --> 07:02.493
♪ Nobody knows ♪

07:10.430 --> 07:14.965
♪ Oh, oh,
suppose you'll never know ♪

07:21.041 --> 07:22.972
Look, everyone in town has tats,

07:22.973 --> 07:24.874
but my art is about commitment.

07:24.875 --> 07:26.716
So, this your art, huh?

07:26.717 --> 07:28.077
Damn straight.

07:28.078 --> 07:29.148
Damn stupid.

07:29.149 --> 07:30.920
The bullet went
all the way through.

07:30.921 --> 07:32.121
Bounced off my ribs.

07:32.122 --> 07:35.024
I have another one
still in my shoulder.

07:35.025 --> 07:37.056
Nice, huh?

07:37.057 --> 07:39.629
You could hang it in the louvre.

07:39.630 --> 07:40.690
I have an ethos.

07:40.691 --> 07:42.692
Why do anything unless
you're willing

07:42.693 --> 07:44.834
to go one step further
than anybody else?

07:44.835 --> 07:47.036
What doesn't kill you,
makes you stronger.

07:47.037 --> 07:48.698
Exactly.

07:48.699 --> 07:50.469
And pain is the great divide.

07:50.470 --> 07:53.503
My coach used to say, it's all
about how we process pain.

07:53.504 --> 07:54.504
Football?

07:54.505 --> 07:56.245
Wrestling, Iowa state.

07:56.246 --> 07:58.477
Iowa? 141.

07:58.478 --> 07:59.149
157.

07:59.150 --> 08:01.150
You got to be more than 180 now.

08:01.151 --> 08:03.683
I'd like to see you
get back under 145.

08:03.684 --> 08:06.485
Excuse me, but thinking
of you men in tights

08:06.486 --> 08:09.559
makes me want to... Puke.

08:09.560 --> 08:12.261
There's a flu going
around the hospital.

08:12.262 --> 08:13.262
Somewhat ironic.

08:16.096 --> 08:18.928
Ow.

08:18.929 --> 08:22.572
Don't push so hard.

08:22.573 --> 08:25.976
Can you lift your shirt
so I can examine your stomach?

08:47.698 --> 08:49.860
Where did you get these?

08:53.233 --> 08:55.665
Claire...

08:55.666 --> 08:58.237
You've had surgery recently.

08:58.238 --> 08:59.969
These scars are still pink.

08:59.970 --> 09:02.271
Don't tell my parents.

09:02.272 --> 09:05.876
You did this in Mexico
so your parents wouldn't know?

09:08.118 --> 09:09.850
What did you have done?

09:15.185 --> 09:17.086
Ahh.

09:17.087 --> 09:19.659
And you noticed her foot
twitching?

09:19.660 --> 09:21.560
Come on, Jamie. My foot.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.933
Oh, yeah.
About three months ago?

09:23.934 --> 09:25.234
Just a little.

09:25.235 --> 09:28.037
We took her to county hospital,
and she got the C.T. scan,

09:28.038 --> 09:29.298
which showed her...

09:29.299 --> 09:30.339
Brain abnormality.

09:30.340 --> 09:31.901
Here, you can put it.

09:31.902 --> 09:33.272
And the twitching
has gotten worse?

09:33.273 --> 09:36.205
A lot worse. They don't have
the proper equipment back home

09:36.206 --> 09:38.307
to figure out what's wrong.

09:38.308 --> 09:41.010
You did a... you did a good thing.
Show mommy.

09:41.011 --> 09:43.953
Yes, your mommy.
Mommy and daddy.

09:43.954 --> 09:46.355
You did a good thing by coming
all this way,

09:46.356 --> 09:47.757
Mr. and Mrs. Hayes.

09:47.758 --> 09:49.318
You sit tight, Jamie, okay?

09:49.319 --> 09:51.791
I'm going to bring in
Dr. Shepherd to see you.

09:51.792 --> 09:55.024
Okay? Dr. Shepherd.

09:55.025 --> 09:56.365
He's the brain specialist.

09:56.366 --> 09:58.367
My mommy and daddy.

09:58.368 --> 10:01.901
Doctor? Is he good,
this Dr. Shepherd?

10:01.902 --> 10:05.175
At just about everything.

10:06.677 --> 10:09.138
I assume the lady needs her keys

10:09.139 --> 10:11.911
to leave this guy's
sorry ass behind.

10:11.912 --> 10:13.943
Yeah. Well, help her out.

10:13.944 --> 10:15.314
He needs a bronchoscopy.

10:15.315 --> 10:16.816
See one, do one, teach one.

10:16.817 --> 10:18.988
You've seen one.
It's time to do one.

10:18.989 --> 10:22.221
Alone? Seriously? Thanks.

10:22.222 --> 10:24.623
I mean, the vote of confidence
in my skills and all...

10:24.624 --> 10:26.756
I didn't think anyone was
noticing how hard...

10:26.757 --> 10:28.728
Izzie? Go. Yeah?

10:28.729 --> 10:30.629
You paged? Where are we?

10:30.630 --> 10:31.861
I did the consult, did the I.V.,

10:31.862 --> 10:33.402
the meds, the post-ops,
everything.

10:33.403 --> 10:34.403
How is your pit patient?

10:34.404 --> 10:36.806
She's febrile
and has peritoneal signs.

10:36.807 --> 10:38.237
You all right, Dr. Yang?

10:38.238 --> 10:41.811
Fine. On my way back to clinic.

10:41.812 --> 10:44.643
I think she had some sort of
illegal surgery done in Mexico.

10:44.644 --> 10:45.945
Botched abortion?

10:45.946 --> 10:47.977
No, she has four laparoscopic
scars on her abdomen

10:47.978 --> 10:49.679
and won't say what they're from.

10:49.680 --> 10:50.920
The parents are clueless.

10:50.921 --> 10:52.121
Oh, she's a minor.

10:52.122 --> 10:53.652
17. Freshman in college.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.384
You order up for a C.T.? Yes.

10:55.385 --> 10:56.425
So, while she's there,

10:56.426 --> 10:59.088
the nurses couldn't
get a foley on Mr. gry.

10:59.089 --> 11:01.861
He may need a coudã© cath if you
can't get a normal one in there.

11:01.862 --> 11:04.834
Write up post-op notes on
all surgical-floor patients

11:04.835 --> 11:07.296
that had surgery
within the last 24 hours.

11:07.297 --> 11:09.739
Be sure to document
their ekgs and x-rays.

11:09.740 --> 11:11.400
Hunt them down
if you can't find them.

11:11.401 --> 11:13.743
Right away.

11:13.744 --> 11:17.046
Hey.

11:17.047 --> 11:19.308
Whoa. Got the flu?

11:19.309 --> 11:21.280
Yeah, and thanks for it.

11:21.281 --> 11:22.982
It's making my life
so much easier.

11:22.983 --> 11:25.354
I didn't give it to you.
It's all over the hospital.

11:25.355 --> 11:27.286
You should be in bed.

11:27.287 --> 11:30.359
Disease, diagnosis,
and prescription from one man.

11:30.360 --> 11:32.722
Seriously, I'll give you
a ride home.

11:32.723 --> 11:34.824
This is not gonna
make me go home.

11:34.825 --> 11:36.695
You go home.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.829
But I feel fine.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.706
Hey, hey, hey...
Have you seen Shepherd?

11:47.707 --> 11:49.408
Not as up close as Meredith has.

11:49.409 --> 11:52.311
What? Are you trying
to get her in trouble?

11:52.312 --> 11:55.084
George, this program will make
or break our careers, okay?

11:55.085 --> 11:57.486
Some of us will make it through,
and some of us won't.

11:57.487 --> 12:00.289
And that decision depends
entirely on recommendations

12:00.290 --> 12:01.420
from doctors like Shepherd.

12:01.421 --> 12:03.823
There is a reason we don't sleep
with the attendings.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.394
It's not her fault,
it's Shepherd's.

12:05.395 --> 12:07.196
He's the attending.
He should know better.

12:07.197 --> 12:08.427
He's taking advantage of her.

12:08.428 --> 12:10.429
It didn't exactly sound like
anything was happening

12:10.430 --> 12:12.002
against her will last night.

12:15.135 --> 12:18.768
Okay, we're in good shape here.

12:18.769 --> 12:20.369
I think so, Dr. Shepherd.

12:20.370 --> 12:21.371
Looks good.

12:30.520 --> 12:31.481
Here you go, doc.

12:31.482 --> 12:33.883
The kid's c.T.S
just arrived from Kennedy.

12:33.884 --> 12:35.154
Thanks. Excuse me.

12:35.155 --> 12:37.027
Sorry, Dr. Taylor.

12:38.058 --> 12:39.829
That would be bourbon.

12:39.830 --> 12:40.830
What?

12:40.831 --> 12:42.431
I smelled it, too.

12:42.432 --> 12:45.194
And he's the best
anesthesiologist on the staff.

12:45.195 --> 12:48.268
I'll worry when he's too juiced
to do his crossword puzzle.

12:56.146 --> 12:58.507
Will you close up for me?

12:58.508 --> 13:00.550
Thank you, everyone.

13:02.112 --> 13:04.083
Dr. Shepherd...
I got to get some coffee.

13:04.084 --> 13:05.815
Jamie Hayes has been admitted...

13:05.816 --> 13:07.887
The little girl
with the brain abnormality.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.218
How's she presenting?

13:09.219 --> 13:11.390
She has what looks like
continuous seizure activity

13:11.391 --> 13:12.491
in her left foot.

13:12.492 --> 13:14.123
Her balance is off.

13:14.124 --> 13:16.095
Her parents have come a long way
to try to find out what's wrong.

13:16.096 --> 13:17.096
How old are these?

13:17.097 --> 13:19.298
Three months old.
I need new ones.

13:19.299 --> 13:22.301
Her brain could look
dramatically different today.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.934
Okay, I'll order them...

13:24.935 --> 13:27.276
Thank you.

13:27.277 --> 13:28.438
Doc.

13:30.510 --> 13:34.813
And that... that's a bullet
from a previous gunshot.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.315
Previous gunshot? Okay.

13:36.316 --> 13:37.546
No reason to take it out.

13:37.547 --> 13:39.448
No, the guy likes pain.

13:39.449 --> 13:40.449
It's his ethos.

13:40.450 --> 13:41.991
Pain as an ethos?

13:41.992 --> 13:44.324
Wait, I think I know this guy.

13:46.496 --> 13:48.397
You remember this guy?

13:48.398 --> 13:50.159
Hey, the tattooed masochist.

13:50.160 --> 13:51.500
Had himself shot again.

13:51.501 --> 13:53.602
Glad to see he's still stupid.

13:53.603 --> 13:54.934
It's his ethos.

13:54.935 --> 13:57.366
Let's go tell him
what he gets to do today.

13:57.367 --> 14:01.110
Dr. Bailey?
Claire rice's abdominal c.T.S.

14:01.111 --> 14:02.541
Is this girl fat?

14:02.542 --> 14:05.374
Not at all.
She's a normal college kid.

14:05.375 --> 14:06.475
So what do you see?

14:06.476 --> 14:09.218
Her stomach's stapled.

14:09.219 --> 14:11.250
She's had a gastric bypass.

14:11.251 --> 14:12.983
And a bad one, at that.

14:20.460 --> 14:24.263
Gastric bypass is a procedure
normally done on obese patients

14:24.264 --> 14:26.095
to help them lose weight.

14:26.096 --> 14:27.096
Claire?

14:27.097 --> 14:29.268
She doesn't need to lose weight.

14:29.269 --> 14:30.499
Are you kidding?

14:30.500 --> 14:32.501
This means the world to her.

14:32.502 --> 14:35.444
But it is so typical of this
girl to take the easy way out.

14:35.445 --> 14:38.077
She's done it with everything
since she was a little kid.

14:38.078 --> 14:41.080
Mrs. rice, nothing about this
is gonna be easy.

14:41.081 --> 14:43.452
She's gonna face a lifelong
struggle with malnutrition

14:43.453 --> 14:45.614
unless she has surgery
to reverse the procedure.

14:45.615 --> 14:47.116
Do the surgery.

14:47.117 --> 14:50.489
I told her to watch
the freshman 15...

14:50.490 --> 14:51.660
Don't eat junk, exercise.

14:51.661 --> 14:53.292
But when she
came home Christmas,

14:53.293 --> 14:54.423
who had to take her out

14:54.424 --> 14:56.465
and buy her a brand-new pair
of size-6 jeans

14:56.466 --> 14:59.368
because she couldn't get in
the ones I got her last summer?

14:59.369 --> 15:01.600
Tina, you know,
she tries so hard.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.202
She does.

15:03.203 --> 15:05.434
She gets good grades.
She gets "a" s.

15:05.435 --> 15:08.938
She has illegal surgery
in Mexico.

15:08.939 --> 15:12.681
Unfortunately, there were
complications with the bypass.

15:12.682 --> 15:14.984
What do you mean?

15:14.985 --> 15:18.447
She has what looks like an
abscess under her diaphragm...

15:18.448 --> 15:21.420
An edema, which is a swelling
of the bowel wall.

15:21.421 --> 15:24.224
I can't say for certain
she'll recover completely.

15:26.496 --> 15:30.130
Just... do whatever you have
to do to make her well, okay?

15:33.203 --> 15:35.404
You look like a Princess.
Do you know you're a Princess?

15:35.405 --> 15:38.007
It's not lipstick.

15:38.008 --> 15:40.239
It's not lipstick?
No, it's not lipstick.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.241
Want to do my shoulder?
Oh, good.

15:42.242 --> 15:43.512
And nose?

15:43.513 --> 15:45.713
Now, we're gonna find out
what's causing these seizures.

15:46.546 --> 15:47.646
Does mri know we're coming down?

15:47.647 --> 15:49.578
You said C.T.

15:49.579 --> 15:51.950
Now I'm saying mri.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.582
It's available.

15:53.583 --> 15:54.623
Good.

15:54.624 --> 15:56.685
Doctor, is she gonna
need surgery?

15:56.686 --> 15:57.956
I don't know yet.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.158
Well, it's just that my wife
and I, we both work.

15:59.159 --> 16:00.229
And I don't know
if our insurance...

16:00.230 --> 16:02.131
W-we know it can be
very expensive.

16:02.132 --> 16:04.034
I don't want you
to worry about that.

16:06.296 --> 16:07.636
It's a focal, left-size seizure.

16:07.637 --> 16:09.568
Let's get that Diazepam
running right now, please.

16:09.569 --> 16:11.200
A tourniquet, please.
Tourniquet.

16:11.201 --> 16:13.102
Hey, Jamie, here's what
we're gonna do.

16:13.103 --> 16:14.973
We're gonna put this
on your arm, okay?

16:14.974 --> 16:16.075
Isn't that fun?

16:16.076 --> 16:18.477
Here, we're gonna put that
onto you, like that.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.249
And this is gonna feel cold.

16:20.250 --> 16:22.511
This is a butterfly.

16:22.512 --> 16:25.114
Butterfly lands right there.
Mmm, there we go.

16:25.115 --> 16:27.757
Blanket for the butterfly...
Good. Nicely done.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.093
It's amazing stuff, isn't it?

16:34.724 --> 16:36.495
Uh-huh.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.697
Hey, you like spaceships? Yeah.

16:38.698 --> 16:41.300
Okay, should we take
captain O'Malley,

16:41.301 --> 16:44.103
my first lieutenant,
to the spaceship mri?

16:44.104 --> 16:46.275
Let's go.

16:46.276 --> 16:49.338
It'll be safer to wait
until your lunch digests

16:49.339 --> 16:51.080
before we do the procedure.

16:51.081 --> 16:53.312
Perfect... this is just perfect.

16:53.313 --> 16:54.783
I was hoping to be in Portland
right now.

16:54.784 --> 16:56.645
You're gonna be under
conscious sedation,

16:56.646 --> 16:58.587
which means you'll be awake,
but groggy.

16:58.588 --> 17:01.250
Wait, wait. Is this gonna hurt?

17:01.251 --> 17:03.592
We'll give you something
for pain.

17:03.593 --> 17:05.753
Do you know how stupid
you make me look?

17:05.755 --> 17:07.656
I thought you would think
this is funny.

17:07.656 --> 17:08.656
Funny?

17:08.657 --> 17:10.759
Romantic?

17:10.760 --> 17:13.402
Like the therapist thing
was funny and romantic?

17:13.403 --> 17:15.334
That was funny.
No, that was sad.

17:15.335 --> 17:18.267
He called my therapist,
pretending to be his therapist,

17:18.268 --> 17:19.708
to find out
what I'd said about him.

17:19.709 --> 17:22.040
A little passive-aggressive,
isn't it, j.P.?

17:22.040 --> 17:23.712
He is the king
of passive-aggressive.

17:23.713 --> 17:24.713
And he's manipulative...

17:25.675 --> 17:26.675
and needy.

17:26.675 --> 17:28.317
Well, that's the trifecta.

17:28.318 --> 17:29.749
What do I win?

17:32.582 --> 17:34.384
What?

17:35.755 --> 17:36.826
Doc!

17:39.129 --> 17:41.390
I prefer we stop meeting
like this, Mr. Owens.

17:41.391 --> 17:42.661
Digby.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.763
So, how's the trumpet playing?

17:44.764 --> 17:46.796
Very safe,
compared to your hobby.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.639
Getting shot
is a little more risky.

17:50.640 --> 17:52.401
That's kind of the point.

17:52.402 --> 17:53.742
He's running a fever.

17:53.743 --> 17:56.205
Due to the extra stress on
his body from the gunshot.

17:56.206 --> 17:58.607
Digby...

17:58.608 --> 18:01.079
The impact of the bullet
on your chest

18:01.080 --> 18:03.712
fractured a rib and caused
a hemopneumothorax.

18:03.713 --> 18:05.514
That sucks, I guess.

18:05.515 --> 18:07.286
There's blood
in your collapsed lung.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.718
The price of body art went up
since your last gunshot.

18:09.719 --> 18:11.560
Ah, no pain, no gain, right?

18:11.561 --> 18:13.422
That's one way to look at it.

18:13.423 --> 18:15.124
We have that in common,
you docs and me.

18:15.125 --> 18:16.195
Do we?

18:16.196 --> 18:19.668
Yeah, the way you guys
push, push, push.

18:19.669 --> 18:21.730
When I was wrestling,
if you wanted to pin me,

18:21.731 --> 18:23.532
you was gonna have to kill me.

18:23.533 --> 18:25.304
Iowa style.

18:25.305 --> 18:26.675
Iowa state style.

18:26.676 --> 18:29.238
Back home,
we were sworn enemies.

18:29.239 --> 18:32.182
But in Seattle, man,
we're brothers.

18:34.344 --> 18:37.586
So, what are we gonna do
about this, um...

18:37.587 --> 18:39.148
Hemopneumo-durasis?

18:39.149 --> 18:41.250
We're gonna insert a chest tube
to drain the blood,

18:41.251 --> 18:42.292
then reinflate your lung.

18:43.353 --> 18:45.624
Oh, please...

18:45.625 --> 18:47.327
Tell me I get to watch.

18:53.563 --> 18:55.835
Oh, man... Iowa style.

18:58.538 --> 19:00.769
Before you guys start,
I know you're mad.

19:00.770 --> 19:04.213
Disbelief, Claire...
Just... Disbelief.

19:04.214 --> 19:05.444
I'm just concerned.

19:05.445 --> 19:07.876
Where did you get the idea
to do this?

19:07.877 --> 19:10.148
The Internet.

19:10.149 --> 19:13.883
Honey, there is a healthy way
to lose weight.

19:14.924 --> 19:18.327
Yeah, I tried that, but...

19:18.328 --> 19:21.390
It doesn't work for me
like it does for you.

19:21.391 --> 19:24.162
Hey, you don't need
to lose weight.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.394
What are you eating?

19:25.395 --> 19:28.197
And how much have you been
working out?

19:28.198 --> 19:31.169
Most of the time, when people
hit their target weight,

19:31.170 --> 19:32.771
they have to work to stay there.

19:32.772 --> 19:37.506
Everyone gains weight
in college, mom.

19:37.507 --> 19:39.708
It's... stressful.

19:39.709 --> 19:44.183
There's... there's not
enough time for exercise.

19:45.855 --> 19:50.359
I just thought if I wasn't
worried about my diet, then...

19:50.360 --> 19:52.891
I could focus more
on my studies.

19:52.892 --> 19:55.324
So you took
yet another shortcut?

19:55.325 --> 19:57.666
Life doesn't work that way,
Claire.

19:57.667 --> 19:58.667
Tina!

19:58.668 --> 20:01.830
What? You want to argue this?

20:01.831 --> 20:03.472
She has so much potential.

20:03.473 --> 20:05.734
If she would just
apply herself...

20:05.735 --> 20:09.978
Okay, I think we should focus on
taking care of your daughter.

20:09.979 --> 20:12.881
And, Claire,
your parents agree...

20:12.882 --> 20:16.785
The best thing to do
is to reverse the bypass.

20:16.786 --> 20:17.786
No!

20:17.787 --> 20:20.819
No, it's my body.

20:20.820 --> 20:23.752
I do not want surgery again.
Please?

20:23.753 --> 20:25.894
There are serious complications.

20:25.895 --> 20:27.896
And this is about your health.

20:27.897 --> 20:30.228
But I'd rather be thin.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.562
Well, I'm afraid the choice
isn't up to you.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.347
It's called
rasmussin's encephalitis.

20:48.348 --> 20:51.380
What it amounts to is that
this side of her brain...

20:51.381 --> 20:53.622
This part's all healthy,
it's working perfectly.

20:53.623 --> 20:55.684
This black part of the brain,
this...

20:55.685 --> 20:57.426
All of that is dead, or dying.

20:57.427 --> 20:59.688
The condition has gotten
radically worse

20:59.689 --> 21:01.790
since her C.T. scans
three months ago.

21:01.791 --> 21:04.993
Left untreated,
the disease is gonna kill her.

21:04.994 --> 21:07.596
How soon?

21:07.597 --> 21:10.038
Too soon.

21:10.039 --> 21:12.000
So, is there a cure?

21:12.001 --> 21:15.043
The treatment requires the
diseased portion of her brain

21:15.044 --> 21:16.705
be removed and sealed off.

21:16.706 --> 21:20.649
See, eventually, the spinal
fluid will fill the cavity.

21:20.650 --> 21:23.011
R-remove? But, I mean, that's...

21:23.012 --> 21:25.585
Half her brain, yes.

21:35.795 --> 21:39.828
Half her brain...
That... Seems impossible.

21:39.829 --> 21:41.900
Her age makes it possible.

21:41.901 --> 21:43.932
Her brain's not fully developed,

21:43.933 --> 21:47.075
so the remaining neurons
will compensate for the loss.

21:47.076 --> 21:48.437
But will she be normal?

21:48.438 --> 21:50.439
There are risks to any surgery,

21:50.440 --> 21:52.611
and this is, you know,
a major one.

21:52.612 --> 21:54.343
But if, you know,
we're successful,

21:54.344 --> 21:56.985
Jamie could walk out of this
hospital in a couple weeks,

21:56.986 --> 21:58.887
go on to live a relatively
normal life.

21:58.888 --> 22:00.419
Look, I know this
is a lot to digest.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.491
The important thing to remember
is that we can save her life.

22:02.492 --> 22:03.652
Thank you.

22:03.653 --> 22:04.693
Dr. O'Malley?

22:04.694 --> 22:05.694
Yes? What?

22:05.695 --> 22:07.456
I'm sorry to bother you.

22:07.457 --> 22:08.857
But if the parents consent,

22:08.858 --> 22:10.829
I thought you'd like to scrub
in on the hemispherectomy.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.901
Are you in, or not?

22:12.902 --> 22:14.803
Uh, in.

22:14.804 --> 22:15.865
Good.

22:23.543 --> 22:24.873
Yay.

22:24.874 --> 22:28.477
I'm scrubbing in on a
hemispherectomy with Shepherd.

22:28.478 --> 22:30.719
Get out! I would kill for that.

22:30.720 --> 22:33.422
We're gonna cut out half
a girl's brain

22:33.423 --> 22:34.983
and it's going to work.

22:34.984 --> 22:36.354
It's outrageous.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.387
Almost makes it hard
to hate him.

22:38.388 --> 22:39.958
Why do you hate him?

22:39.959 --> 22:41.359
Oh, no reason.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.562
You know about him and Meredith?

22:43.563 --> 22:44.793
You know?

22:44.794 --> 22:47.466
When are you gonna figure out
that I know everything?

22:47.467 --> 22:48.467
She knows.

22:48.468 --> 22:49.768
What, about doctor-cest?

22:49.769 --> 22:51.700
It's been going on for,
like, ever.

22:51.701 --> 22:52.871
And you didn't tell us?

22:52.872 --> 22:54.372
Ooh, you're a gossip, huh?

22:54.373 --> 22:55.405
I am not! I am.

22:56.706 --> 22:59.107
He's about to go into major
brain surgery on no sleep?

22:59.108 --> 23:00.549
Not very responsible.

23:00.550 --> 23:01.680
Jealous much?

23:01.681 --> 23:03.582
Sex all night isn't about
being responsible.

23:03.583 --> 23:05.053
No, it's about sex all night.

23:05.054 --> 23:07.456
I can't believe you're not
more pissed off about this.

23:07.457 --> 23:09.918
Well, she works hard all day.
She's got a hard job.

23:09.919 --> 23:11.790
Why should you care
how she unwinds?

23:11.791 --> 23:13.121
I mean, you like to
bake all night.

23:13.122 --> 23:14.463
Some people like to drink.

23:14.464 --> 23:16.394
Others like an occasional
screaming orgasm.

23:16.395 --> 23:17.527
Yeah, we do.

23:19.398 --> 23:22.100
Forget I said that.
Pretend like I'm not here.

23:22.101 --> 23:24.473
Continue.

23:24.474 --> 23:27.536
You look like
you need to be spoon-fed.

23:27.537 --> 23:28.777
You look like Alex.

23:28.778 --> 23:30.178
Yeah, about drinking...

23:30.179 --> 23:32.410
Dr. Taylor,
the anesthesiologist...

23:32.411 --> 23:35.083
Do you think he drinks?

23:35.084 --> 23:36.815
Whatever gets you
through the day.

23:36.816 --> 23:39.449
I mean here, at work.
Earlier, I thought I smelled...

23:40.550 --> 23:41.890
Do you think...

23:41.891 --> 23:44.454
I mean, his patients
trust that...

23:45.455 --> 23:47.526
So I should say something,
right?

23:47.527 --> 23:50.529
It's a can of worms, George.

23:50.530 --> 23:52.831
Weren't we talking about sex,
anyway?

23:52.832 --> 23:55.134
Doofus. Ew.

23:59.008 --> 24:02.440
This is gonna leave
a pretty sexy scar, huh?

24:02.441 --> 24:04.713
Don't get any more crazy ideas.

24:04.714 --> 24:06.815
You really think my ideas
are crazy?

24:06.816 --> 24:08.446
I'm leaning that way.

24:08.447 --> 24:11.179
We wrestle, he plays trumpet.

24:11.180 --> 24:13.451
Hey, I feel pretty dizzy.

24:13.452 --> 24:15.124
You've lost some blood.

24:16.185 --> 24:19.187
This, too, shall pass.

24:19.188 --> 24:21.159
Hey...

24:21.160 --> 24:24.693
How come I don't see you down
at the mat in belltown?

24:24.694 --> 24:25.894
Oh, man, no time.

24:25.895 --> 24:27.537
Bro, make time.

24:28.538 --> 24:30.539
I'll be expecting you.

24:30.540 --> 24:31.671
I'm there.

24:36.245 --> 24:37.846
Handle with care.

24:37.847 --> 24:40.549
This thing's full of gunk.
I know.

24:40.550 --> 24:43.051
We need to free the bowel
from the adhesions

24:43.052 --> 24:45.784
caused from the abscess.

24:45.785 --> 24:47.856
This poor girl...

24:47.857 --> 24:49.217
What was she thinking?

24:49.218 --> 24:51.489
She wants her mother's approval.

24:51.490 --> 24:52.791
She wanted to please her.

24:52.792 --> 24:55.263
And this damage is the result?

24:55.264 --> 24:56.765
Here, resect that.

24:56.766 --> 24:59.568
Needle-tip over here, please.

24:59.569 --> 25:02.200
When you're done here,
you have post-ops waiting.

25:02.201 --> 25:03.902
I know, Dr. Bailey.

25:03.903 --> 25:05.073
Cristina's got the flu,

25:05.074 --> 25:06.905
so you need to pick up the slack
in the clinic.

25:06.906 --> 25:09.178
Look, I'll mop the floors, okay?

25:10.239 --> 25:12.040
Sorry, that was inappropriate.

25:12.041 --> 25:14.243
It's not the only thing
that's inappropriate.

25:17.547 --> 25:20.589
You care to tell me what
you think you're doing?

25:20.590 --> 25:22.691
I'll jump through hoops
if you want me to.

25:22.692 --> 25:25.654
But what I do what I leave
this hospital is my business.

25:25.655 --> 25:27.756
Half this hospital
knows your business.

25:27.757 --> 25:30.228
Flu isn't the only virus
spreading around here.

25:30.229 --> 25:31.860
I made a choice, and I know

25:31.861 --> 25:34.202
you don't respect me
for that choice.

25:34.203 --> 25:36.264
But I'll live
with the consequences.

25:36.265 --> 25:39.768
Then I'll have lots of hoops
for you to jump through.

25:39.769 --> 25:42.310
I've done everything
you've asked me to do.

25:42.311 --> 25:43.642
I may not do it your way,
but it gets done.

25:43.643 --> 25:47.776
So whatever else you got,
bring it on.

25:47.777 --> 25:50.019
Ew!

25:51.280 --> 25:52.681
Okay, Dr. grey,

25:52.682 --> 25:55.283
now that you've
drained the organ,

25:55.284 --> 25:57.586
we can attempt to repair it.

25:57.587 --> 26:00.760
Now my day is perfect.

26:07.236 --> 26:08.567
Bye.

26:10.099 --> 26:12.240
I appreciate this.

26:12.241 --> 26:17.275
The chance to scrub in on this
kind of procedure is, well...

26:17.276 --> 26:18.747
Yeah, I appreciate it.

26:18.748 --> 26:21.279
Here you go.
Triple Espresso, not too hot.

26:21.280 --> 26:24.082
Oh, I love you, seriously.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.855
Ah, coffee... where would
medicine be without it, huh?

26:26.856 --> 26:28.987
I hope you have
a new crossword, Taylor.

26:28.988 --> 26:30.358
We're gonna be here awhile.

26:30.359 --> 26:31.820
Never go without.

26:31.821 --> 26:34.222
Big day for you, kid...
Congrats.

26:34.223 --> 26:35.223
Thanks.

26:35.224 --> 26:36.224
Hey, Princess.

26:36.225 --> 26:38.226
You ready to take a nap?

26:38.227 --> 26:40.298
Hey, look what I got.
Blow bubbles... that's it.

26:40.299 --> 26:42.270
You just breathe in.
Oh, that's it.

26:42.271 --> 26:43.271
What?

26:43.272 --> 26:44.833
Do you smell...

26:44.834 --> 26:47.606
Smell what? I have a mask.

26:51.941 --> 26:54.182
Uh...

26:54.183 --> 26:58.046
I'm sorry, Dr. Taylor,
but did you just...

26:58.047 --> 27:00.188
Have you been drinking?

27:00.189 --> 27:02.350
I beg your pardon?

27:02.351 --> 27:03.192
What?

27:03.193 --> 27:06.855
Do you smell...
I-i smell alcohol.

27:06.856 --> 27:08.226
Where the hell do you get off

27:08.227 --> 27:09.829
accusing me
of something like that?

27:11.661 --> 27:13.101
George, you're out of line.

27:13.102 --> 27:14.262
There are rules.

27:14.263 --> 27:16.204
You know,
there are rules for a reason.

27:16.205 --> 27:17.667
You ju...

27:20.009 --> 27:23.312
There is a 2-year-old girl
on this table.

27:25.044 --> 27:27.876
You shouldn't take advantage of
someone else's vulnerability.

27:27.877 --> 27:30.779
I don't need some punk intern
telling me what's at stake here.

27:30.780 --> 27:32.281
Get him out of here, shep.

27:35.054 --> 27:37.325
Shep?

27:37.326 --> 27:39.288
You're out, George.

27:48.297 --> 27:51.139
You damned well better
be ready, Taylor.

27:51.140 --> 27:53.272
I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.

27:55.674 --> 27:59.978
Do you really, seriously
want to know why I'm leaving?!

27:59.979 --> 28:02.380
How about when you started
insisting that I quit my job,

28:02.381 --> 28:04.883
right when I started to
make more money than you?

28:04.884 --> 28:06.384
That should have been
the last straw.

28:06.385 --> 28:09.017
No, the last straw should have
been when I found out that

28:09.018 --> 28:11.319
those mysterious phone calls
that you've been getting

28:11.320 --> 28:13.361
that you kept denying were
from other women...

28:13.362 --> 28:15.263
Were really coming from
your mother!

28:15.264 --> 28:16.965
This isn't healthy.

28:16.966 --> 28:17.966
Just hold still, please.

28:17.967 --> 28:19.397
Don't you dare
try to patch this up!

28:19.398 --> 28:21.169
Okay, could the both of you
just please stop?

28:21.170 --> 28:23.972
You don't love me, j.P.
You love to smother me.

28:23.973 --> 28:26.304
And if I could get you
to just admit that,

28:26.305 --> 28:29.337
then I could leave you
with an ounce of respect.

28:29.338 --> 28:31.179
Athena, I let you stay in here
to keep him calm.

28:31.180 --> 28:32.710
So if you're just gonna keep
arguing...

28:32.711 --> 28:35.713
Check that... I can't respect
a man desperate enough

28:35.714 --> 28:37.315
to swallow my exit strategy.

28:37.316 --> 28:39.317
That is the last straw!

28:39.318 --> 28:41.219
Michelle, can you get her
out of here?

28:41.220 --> 28:42.350
Ma'am?

28:42.351 --> 28:43.753
Fine!

28:46.195 --> 28:47.957
Come on. What?

28:49.328 --> 28:50.498
What's happening?

28:50.499 --> 28:52.460
The keys moved farther down.

28:52.461 --> 28:54.833
Oh, my god, what does that mean?

28:54.834 --> 28:57.405
What did you do?
Don't you dare die, j.P.!

28:57.406 --> 28:59.437
Please! Please, just shut up!

28:59.438 --> 29:03.042
Breathe, j.P. Just breathe.

29:04.313 --> 29:06.045
Got it.

29:13.252 --> 29:15.154
Very impressive, j.P.

29:16.155 --> 29:18.526
Is he okay? Is he gonna be okay?

29:18.527 --> 29:20.359
Yeah, he'll be fine.

29:26.065 --> 29:30.099
You lit... you did that
on purpose, didn't you?

29:31.140 --> 29:33.802
Can I offer you some advice?

29:33.803 --> 29:37.546
Get in your car and go,
for all of our sakes.

29:38.978 --> 29:41.410
You'll never know
where I parked it.

29:47.256 --> 29:48.256
I need a shower.

29:48.257 --> 29:49.387
I need a shower.

29:49.388 --> 29:51.189
You need to go tell
that girl's parents

29:51.190 --> 29:52.921
what kind of kid
they're getting back.

29:52.922 --> 29:54.993
You're not gonna let me
shower first?

29:54.994 --> 29:56.995
That would be a hoop,
would it not?

29:56.996 --> 29:59.567
It would qualify.

29:59.568 --> 30:01.470
Shower first, then.

30:04.974 --> 30:06.574
Ew, what smells?

30:06.575 --> 30:09.137
That would be me...
Or more specifically,

30:09.138 --> 30:11.139
my patient's insides
all over me.

30:11.140 --> 30:13.842
That makes me strangely happy.

30:13.843 --> 30:17.445
Oh, god.
Oh, Meredith, you smell like...

30:17.446 --> 30:18.847
Karma.

30:18.848 --> 30:19.918
What?

30:19.919 --> 30:20.919
Nothing.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.550
