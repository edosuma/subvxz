00:17.150 --> 00:20.552
ANNOUNCER: FX presents
The People v. O.J. Simpson.

00:27.527 --> 00:28.994
KARDASHIAN:
It's great that you guys won.

00:28.996 --> 00:30.562
I'm just saying
you should pass more.

00:30.564 --> 00:32.698
ROB: I think I...
I don't think I should pass.

00:32.700 --> 00:35.134
<i>I</i> want to make the goals.
You're being a ball hog.

00:35.136 --> 00:36.835
All right...
I-I said...
<i>You're</i> a ball hog.

00:36.837 --> 00:39.038
Oh, man.
Hey, guys, guys.

00:39.040 --> 00:41.006
Are you sure you don't want
to eat somewhere else?

00:41.008 --> 00:42.508
No. Chin Chin!
No, Chin Chin!

00:42.510 --> 00:44.076
Daddy,
we love Chin Chin!
Okay. All right.

00:44.078 --> 00:45.210
It's just, it's
Father's Day,

00:45.212 --> 00:46.678
so it's a bit crowded.

00:46.680 --> 00:48.647
Excuse me. Come on.

00:48.649 --> 00:50.215
Excuse us.
Excuse us, sorry.

00:50.217 --> 00:51.417
Come on.
HOSTESS:
We're so sorry.

00:51.419 --> 00:53.052
Thank you for coming.
Just wait,

00:53.054 --> 00:54.820
just wait a little
bit longer.
Excuse me.

00:54.822 --> 00:56.488
I'm sorry. Hi.
We'll get you right... Yes?

00:56.490 --> 00:58.991
How long would it be
for a party of five?
Oh, my God.

00:58.993 --> 01:00.726
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

01:00.728 --> 01:03.162
You're Richard Cordovian.
My God, you're the O.J. guy.

01:03.164 --> 01:06.098
I'm-I'm Robert Kardashian.
Oh, my God. Yes!

01:06.100 --> 01:07.933
I knew it!
No way! No way!

01:07.935 --> 01:09.601
This is so cool.
Come this way.

01:09.603 --> 01:11.170
You can have whatever
table you want.

01:11.172 --> 01:14.039
Oh.
What? Whoa!

01:14.041 --> 01:16.075
We don't even have to wait!

01:16.077 --> 01:18.677
(laughs):
Let's go.

01:20.246 --> 01:22.181
Right this way.

01:22.183 --> 01:24.083
What do you say, kids?

01:24.085 --> 01:25.451
KIDS:
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

01:25.453 --> 01:26.752
You're welcome.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.554
Thank you.

01:28.556 --> 01:30.089
"Oh, my God,
you're Richard Cordovian!

01:30.091 --> 01:31.957
I knew it!
I knew it!"
Okay, okay.

01:31.959 --> 01:33.292
(giggling)

01:33.294 --> 01:34.726
Four years.

01:34.728 --> 01:36.095
Don't ask Mom for it.
Yeah, four years.

01:36.097 --> 01:37.796
(kids chatter quietly)

01:37.798 --> 01:39.965
KHLOE:
Daddy?

01:39.967 --> 01:42.634
Do you think O.J. did it?

01:42.636 --> 01:44.470
No, of course not.

01:44.472 --> 01:45.871
You know Uncle Juice.

01:45.873 --> 01:47.639
You know he would never hurt
anyone.

01:47.641 --> 01:49.108
Well, Mom says he did.

01:49.110 --> 01:50.576
Look, your mother...

01:50.578 --> 01:52.377
your mother's
very emotional right now.

01:52.379 --> 01:55.481
And I understand that;
she lost Nicole.

01:55.483 --> 01:57.216
We all lost Nicole.

01:57.218 --> 01:58.817
But...

01:58.819 --> 02:01.320
she shouldn't be talking
to you about these things.

02:01.322 --> 02:03.989
Why? The entire universe
is talking about it.

02:03.991 --> 02:06.391
And people ask me about it
all day.

02:06.393 --> 02:09.261
I mean, he <i>is</i> my godfather.

02:09.263 --> 02:11.296
That's right, he is,
and your Uncle Juice...

02:11.298 --> 02:14.133
your Uncle Juice is a good man.

02:14.135 --> 02:17.236
In fact, I'm gonna tell the
whole world exactly that on TV.

02:17.238 --> 02:18.303
Barbara Walters called me.

02:18.305 --> 02:20.139
Barbara Walters?
Yeah. Uh-huh.

02:20.141 --> 02:22.241
She knows you?
KIM: She talked to
Mom and Bruce, too.

02:22.243 --> 02:24.343
Bruce is famous!
He won the Olympics!

02:24.345 --> 02:26.011
KHLOE: Bruce and Mom
sell Thighmasters on TV,

02:26.013 --> 02:27.179
so that means that
they're <i>both</i> famous.

02:27.181 --> 02:28.981
Dad, why are you famous?
I'm not.

02:28.983 --> 02:32.017
L... Listen, guys, listen to me.

02:32.019 --> 02:34.520
Look, you know
your grandparents.

02:34.522 --> 02:36.288
You know me, and what I try

02:36.290 --> 02:37.789
to pass on to you.

02:37.791 --> 02:39.791
We are Kardashians.

02:39.793 --> 02:41.960
And in this family,
being a good person

02:41.962 --> 02:44.329
and a loyal friend is
more important than...

02:44.331 --> 02:45.597
than being famous.

02:45.599 --> 02:47.166
Fame is fleeting. It's hollow.

02:47.168 --> 02:48.934
It means
nothing at all

02:48.936 --> 02:51.136
without a virtuous heart.

02:51.138 --> 02:53.172
♪
Hmm?

02:53.174 --> 02:55.641
♪ 'Cause love could never ever

02:55.643 --> 02:57.609
♪ Feel so strong...

02:57.611 --> 02:59.311

02:59.313 --> 03:01.046
Don't... I-I'm not
starting out with one.

03:01.048 --> 03:02.814
One for Dad.
Do you want one, Dad?

03:02.816 --> 03:04.249
Yes. Thank you.
Okay.

03:14.160 --> 03:16.028
♪

03:17.964 --> 03:20.132
WOMAN: This feels like
the story of the year.

03:20.134 --> 03:21.633
We all agree the mug shot
is our cover?

03:21.635 --> 03:22.868
MAN:
But it'll be in every daily,

03:22.870 --> 03:24.336
so by the time
we hit the stands,

03:24.338 --> 03:26.038
this shot will be old news.

03:26.040 --> 03:27.973
So we need to jazz it up;
we need something dramatic.

03:27.975 --> 03:29.141
Okay.

03:29.143 --> 03:30.542
All right, try
something like noir,

03:30.544 --> 03:32.077
intrigue.
Mm.

03:32.079 --> 03:34.813
I could add
a bit of chiaroscuro.

03:34.815 --> 03:36.915
Heavy shadow.
Like Rembrandt.

03:36.917 --> 03:38.684
My God,
that's great.

03:38.686 --> 03:39.918
Yeah. That pops.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.887
He really looks trapped.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.322
Haunted.

03:43.324 --> 03:45.390
The falling of an idol.

03:45.392 --> 03:47.893
(siren wailing in distance)

03:57.203 --> 03:58.937
(cameras clicking)

04:00.873 --> 04:02.441
Good afternoon.

04:02.443 --> 04:04.276
I'm Deputy District Attorney
Marcia Clark,

04:04.278 --> 04:06.178
and what I will outline
for you today

04:06.180 --> 04:09.214
are my office's charges against
Mr. Orenthal James Simpson

04:09.216 --> 04:11.350
in the murders
of Nicole Brown Simpson

04:11.352 --> 04:15.554
and Mr. Ronald Lyle Goldman
on the evening of June 12, 1994.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.456
(over TV): I think the facts
speak for themselves.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.124
Simpson's blood was found
at Bundy.

04:19.126 --> 04:21.059
Nicole's blood was found
at Rockingham.

04:21.061 --> 04:24.229
And both Nicole and Ronald's
blood were found in the Bronco.

04:24.231 --> 04:26.865
Simpson will be charged
with the premeditated deaths

04:26.867 --> 04:28.367
of both victims,

04:28.369 --> 04:30.068
and that is precisely
what we will prove.

04:30.070 --> 04:31.637
FEMALE REPORTER:
What about the Bronco chase?

04:31.639 --> 04:33.272
Do you think he was
escaping to Mexico?

04:33.274 --> 04:34.606
Are there plans
to charge anyone else?

04:34.608 --> 04:36.308
Mr. Simpson is charged alone,

04:36.310 --> 04:38.110
because he is the sole murderer.

04:38.112 --> 04:39.578
Is death penalty on the table?

04:39.580 --> 04:42.948
I'd say everything
is on the table.

04:42.950 --> 04:45.350
(over TV):
Any other questions?

04:52.158 --> 04:54.326
MAN: Great job, Marcia.
(chuckles)

04:56.095 --> 04:58.130
Congratulations.

04:58.132 --> 05:00.132
A star is born.
Thank you.

05:00.134 --> 05:02.134
But with this kind
of physical evidence

05:02.136 --> 05:05.504
and a run for the border, he
practically did my job for me.

05:06.773 --> 05:08.307
Oh. (laughs)

05:08.309 --> 05:10.242
Can I have
your autograph?

05:10.244 --> 05:11.276
Oh, shut up.

05:11.278 --> 05:13.245
You love all this.

05:13.247 --> 05:15.914
Just think, a year ago, you
wouldn't even have been here;

05:15.916 --> 05:18.317
you were a supervisor.
Gil said I must be

05:18.319 --> 05:20.786
the first civil servant
to ever ask for a demotion.

05:20.788 --> 05:23.288
It's back to the courtroom.
Trial junkie.

05:23.290 --> 05:25.490
Mm, it's better than sex.

05:26.626 --> 05:27.859
(sighs)

05:49.282 --> 05:50.849
(groans)

05:50.851 --> 05:53.185
Shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit!

05:59.692 --> 06:01.026
Linda?

06:01.028 --> 06:03.528
Get me F. Lee Bailey
on the phone.

06:05.965 --> 06:08.300
LINDA (calls):
It's ringing.

06:09.569 --> 06:11.703
Lee. It's Bob.

06:13.339 --> 06:14.906
Well, I've been better.

06:14.908 --> 06:18.477
(chuckles):
No, I am not crawling.

06:18.479 --> 06:21.012
I'm inquiring.

06:21.014 --> 06:23.048
How soon could you get out here?

06:23.050 --> 06:25.484
("The Girl from Ipanema"
playing)

06:25.486 --> 06:28.920
Lee, I can't tell you
how much I appreciate

06:28.922 --> 06:31.156
your dropping everything
and flying out here.

06:31.158 --> 06:33.392
It means the world to me.

06:33.394 --> 06:35.494
What, and miss the party?

06:35.496 --> 06:38.063
Uh... wowsie.

06:38.065 --> 06:41.032
You're sure up a creek
of high-grade manure.

06:41.034 --> 06:44.202
How are the boys?
How is Linell?

06:44.204 --> 06:47.005
Everyone's good,
they're bad, they're...

06:47.007 --> 06:49.441
I-I don't know.
I can't think.

06:49.443 --> 06:50.909
There's a streak
of blood going from

06:50.911 --> 06:53.445
the murder scene
right to O.J.'s carpet

06:53.447 --> 06:56.248
in his bedroom; and then there's
the gloves, and then he runs.

06:56.250 --> 07:00.519
He gets into that stupid Bronco
and he runs.

07:00.521 --> 07:02.788
Yeah, I caught that
on the news.

07:02.790 --> 07:05.524
You know, my most famous client
ran-- Sam Sheppard.

07:05.526 --> 07:07.592
(sighs)
He ran because
he was innocent.

07:07.594 --> 07:10.796
Everyone prejudged him,
but I got him off.

07:10.798 --> 07:12.697
I know. I saw the movie, Lee.

07:12.699 --> 07:15.567
But this is what I'm
up against. Watch this.

07:15.569 --> 07:18.236
Every channel.
It doesn't matter.

07:18.238 --> 07:20.038
I've never seen
a more obvious case of guilt.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.274
Uh, if Simpson is innocent,
Geraldo...

07:22.276 --> 07:24.576
LARRY KING: Alan Dershowitz,
in all your years,

07:24.578 --> 07:27.078
have you ever seen
a sensational,

07:27.080 --> 07:29.080
tragic case like this?

07:29.082 --> 07:31.583
In a short word, Larry, no.

07:31.585 --> 07:33.919
The evidence against Simpson
is overwhelming.

07:33.921 --> 07:36.054
KING: All right, Alan,
what about a plea deal?

07:36.056 --> 07:37.656
Could that be
in the cards?

07:37.658 --> 07:39.791
Larry, settling is
Robert Shapiro's specialty,

07:39.793 --> 07:41.226
much more than actually
trying cases in a courtroom.

07:41.228 --> 07:42.427
(sighs)

07:42.429 --> 07:44.329
But with a vicious
double murder,

07:44.331 --> 07:46.798
then Simpson
attempting escape, no.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.600
O.J. Simpson
is gonna stand trial

07:48.602 --> 07:51.636
for two counts of murder one,
maybe special circumstances.

07:51.638 --> 07:53.138
Aw, go to hell, Dershowitz!

07:53.140 --> 07:55.974
(remote control clatters,
Shapiro grunts)

07:55.976 --> 07:57.509
Do you see what
I'm up against here?

07:57.511 --> 07:59.077
They've got me down
as the schmuck

07:59.079 --> 08:00.779
that'll walk O.J.
to the gas chamber,

08:00.781 --> 08:03.448
and then the most famous lawyer
in the whole country

08:03.450 --> 08:06.451
is gonna dictate and narrate it
on <i>Larry King Live.</i>

08:06.453 --> 08:10.422
You think Alan's the most famous
lawyer in the country?

08:10.424 --> 08:12.757
(laughs)

08:12.759 --> 08:15.460
Thank God
he's so photogenic.

08:15.462 --> 08:17.629
How do I shut him up?

08:17.631 --> 08:19.998
How do you shut Dershowitz up?

08:20.000 --> 08:23.535
I like Alan,
but he's a smug son of a bitch.

08:23.537 --> 08:26.071
Every 15th word is "Harvard."

08:27.306 --> 08:29.541
Look...

08:29.543 --> 08:32.811
there's only one way
to shut up Dershowitz.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.446
Hire him.

08:36.449 --> 08:38.450
GIL: <i>Oh, trust me,</i>
<i>it'll be better here.</i>

08:38.452 --> 08:39.951
But he killed them

08:39.953 --> 08:41.786
five minutes from the
Santa Monica Courthouse.

08:41.788 --> 08:44.322
Yeah, I know, I know,
but we can't ask them

08:44.324 --> 08:46.224
to move the trial
to Santa Monica.

08:46.226 --> 08:48.393
And they're way behind
fixing the earthquake damage,

08:48.395 --> 08:50.362
and the media room's dinky;
it's downtown.

08:50.364 --> 08:51.997
There'll be room
for everybody.

08:51.999 --> 08:53.732
That way, we can
handle the press,

08:53.734 --> 08:56.902
we have our offices
and resources down here.

08:56.904 --> 08:59.804
Plus, the optics are
a million times better.

09:00.806 --> 09:02.574
The "optics"?

09:02.576 --> 09:04.009
What's an optic?

09:04.011 --> 09:05.243
Marcia.

09:05.245 --> 09:06.845
I have a black
voting base

09:06.847 --> 09:08.747
and I can't risk getting
an all-white jury.

09:08.749 --> 09:10.882
I don't want to hear
the words "Rodney King"

09:10.884 --> 09:13.385
or "Simi Valley"
ever again.
I don't know.

09:13.387 --> 09:15.887
Doesn't Simpson deserve
a jury of his peers?

09:15.889 --> 09:18.223
You know, rich,
middle-aged white men?

09:18.225 --> 09:20.759
Marcia...
I'm kidding.

09:20.761 --> 09:23.194
It's the truth, but I'm kidding.

09:23.196 --> 09:25.997
Anyhow, downtown is fine by me.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.766
I've won 19 out of 20

09:27.768 --> 09:30.702
homicide trials here.
Yeah, that's great.

09:30.704 --> 09:32.737
This office tries
tens of thousands of cases;

09:32.739 --> 09:35.607
people only pay attention
to a couple of the loud ones.

09:35.609 --> 09:37.542
We have a winning hand.

09:37.544 --> 09:40.278

09:56.930 --> 09:59.264

10:01.234 --> 10:03.134
Best DNA mind in the business.

10:03.136 --> 10:06.237
Ooh, DNA. To be 30 again.
New guard, meet old guard.

10:06.239 --> 10:07.706
This is Pat McKenna,
our lead investigator.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.407
Pat.

10:09.409 --> 10:11.710
He can go down and dirty;
he's dug for the best.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.878
All right, enough of the intros.
Alan made a reservation

10:13.880 --> 10:15.547
for lunch at Spago's.
Yeah, do you mind terribly

10:15.549 --> 10:18.483
if we skipped lunch and just
worked through the afternoon?

10:18.485 --> 10:21.553
I got a lot to cover, and I'm on
a 5:30 back to Boston.

10:21.555 --> 10:23.922
Oh. Really?

10:23.924 --> 10:25.590
Yeah, that's how
this is gonna work.

10:25.592 --> 10:28.793
I'll come out often, but
my manpower's back at Harvard.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.128

10:30.130 --> 10:32.430
DERSHOWITZ:
<i>So, then, the first week</i>

10:32.432 --> 10:35.467
culminates with Simpson
deciding to make a run for it

10:35.469 --> 10:37.569
while under your supervision...
SHAPIRO: Careful.

10:37.571 --> 10:39.838
...leaving behind
a letter that <i>sounds</i> like

10:39.840 --> 10:42.073
an admission of guilt,
that you guys,

10:42.075 --> 10:44.676
for some mystifying reason,
read aloud on television.

10:44.678 --> 10:46.344
Bob thought it was
a good idea.

10:46.346 --> 10:47.612
SHAPIRO:
No, no, wait, wait.

10:47.614 --> 10:49.014
Why did you say that?

10:49.016 --> 10:50.815
You don't know
what it was like that day.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.350
You weren't there.

10:52.352 --> 10:54.319
Of course. And I'm here
to help, not to judge.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.087
Oh, you <i>are</i> here to judge.
What was that?

10:56.089 --> 10:57.288
What was all that?
Bob,

10:57.290 --> 10:59.090
you have to move fast.
Your client,

10:59.092 --> 11:00.792
his goodwill, all
of his popularity

11:00.794 --> 11:04.629
and accomplishments,
it's a depreciating asset.

11:04.631 --> 11:06.097
What do you mean?

11:06.099 --> 11:08.633
Right now, he's sort of
like this handsome,

11:08.635 --> 11:11.002
gifted Greek god laid low.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.804
It's a tragedy.

11:12.806 --> 11:15.440
But he's still
a Greek god.

11:15.442 --> 11:17.142
The longer he sits
in that cell,

11:17.144 --> 11:19.978
the more the public sees him
in a jumpsuit and cuffs,

11:19.980 --> 11:21.946
the more mortal he becomes.

11:21.948 --> 11:23.381
That's the clock we're fighting.

11:23.383 --> 11:24.783
Excuse me.

11:24.785 --> 11:27.018
He's never gonna stop
being The Juice.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.288
All right, you know what,
time is short,

11:30.290 --> 11:31.890
so let's get
to your biggest obstacle:

11:31.892 --> 11:33.692
the overwhelming
physical evidence,

11:33.694 --> 11:37.062
all of which seems to support
the conclusion that O.J. did it.

11:37.064 --> 11:39.164
Okay, we understand that,
so why don't you tell us

11:39.166 --> 11:40.465
something we don't know?

11:40.467 --> 11:42.133
Why don't you suggest something?

11:44.570 --> 11:46.237
Barry.

11:46.239 --> 11:50.041
Well, how much do you gentlemen
know about DNA evidence?

11:50.043 --> 11:51.342
Pretend not much.

11:51.344 --> 11:53.378
That's okay,
'cause not a lot of people do.

11:53.380 --> 11:56.648
But it is on the verge
of revolutionizing criminal law.

11:56.650 --> 11:58.316
In a couple years,
it will be

11:58.318 --> 12:01.252
at the crux of any case of
violence without eyewitnesses.

12:01.254 --> 12:03.555
Okay, can you see DNA
through a microscope?

12:03.557 --> 12:05.690
No, no. A DNA molecule's
about two nanometers

12:05.692 --> 12:07.258
in width, whereas,
like, a human hair's

12:07.260 --> 12:10.328
about 80,000 nanometers, so
it presents representationally

12:10.330 --> 12:11.563
with electrons and
scanning-tunneling,

12:11.565 --> 12:13.164
atomic force
microscopes...

12:13.166 --> 12:15.700
Okay, okay, okay, cut to the...
cut to the quick.

12:15.702 --> 12:18.536
Can you use DNA to show
that it's someone else?

12:18.538 --> 12:21.106
Not at all.
I mean, the chances of-of

12:21.108 --> 12:24.242
one individual's DNA profile
matching another person's

12:24.244 --> 12:25.744
are extremely small.

12:25.746 --> 12:27.946
It's roughly one in a billion.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.547
Great. We're screwed.

12:29.549 --> 12:31.716
Wh-What's your contribution
here, anyway?

12:31.718 --> 12:33.752
Why-why are you here?
DERSHOWITZ: Hold on.
Bob, you're so emotional.

12:33.754 --> 12:35.687
Aw, come on,
come on, so are you.
Barry, Barry...

12:35.689 --> 12:38.456
Barry, clarify your strategy.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.225
Okay.

12:40.227 --> 12:43.528
I'm not going to contest
the DNA matches.

12:43.530 --> 12:47.365
I'm going to keep them
out of court entirely.

12:49.535 --> 12:53.938
If it can be shown
that there <i>may</i> have been errors

12:53.940 --> 12:55.774
in the collection
or the handling

12:55.776 --> 12:58.309
of the samples used for the
prosecution's DNA analysis,

12:58.311 --> 13:01.312
we can contest the validity
of the evidence itself.

13:01.314 --> 13:03.114
At best, we get
some of it thrown out,

13:03.116 --> 13:06.651
and at worst, we get the jury
to question it, the very idea.

13:06.653 --> 13:09.788
DERSHOWITZ: We will attack
every assumption,

13:09.790 --> 13:12.457
question every single molecule
of evidence,

13:12.459 --> 13:14.659
every aspect of how that
molecule was gathered,

13:14.661 --> 13:16.461
handled and analyzed.

13:16.463 --> 13:17.929
We will disrupt
their presentation

13:17.931 --> 13:19.798
of physical evidence
at every turn.

13:19.800 --> 13:22.167
We will hack at them.

13:22.169 --> 13:25.236
Make every piece of evidence
presented either thrown out,

13:25.238 --> 13:27.272
untrustworthy or confusing.

13:27.274 --> 13:29.040
No quarter.

13:36.015 --> 13:37.282
Oh, boy.

13:37.284 --> 13:39.317
(chuckles) I better get going.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.785

13:40.787 --> 13:42.620
BAILEY:
<i>I never thought I'd say this,</i>

13:42.622 --> 13:44.689
but I like the nerd science guy.

13:44.691 --> 13:46.624
Mm, but he's esoteric,
and we also have to think

13:46.626 --> 13:48.326
about the things
in the physical world,

13:48.328 --> 13:49.994
things we can see
with our own eyeballs.

13:49.996 --> 13:53.031
What do you got, Pat?
So far, nothing I can
sink my teeth into.

13:53.033 --> 13:55.800
All I've seen is the LAPD acting
like they were O.J.'s butler.

13:55.802 --> 13:57.836
"Would you like a
police escort home?"

13:57.838 --> 13:59.204
"Could we get you
some juice, Juice?"

13:59.206 --> 14:01.673
I do know one of the
detectives a little.

14:01.675 --> 14:03.842
Worked with him once doing
security for Johnny Carson.

14:03.844 --> 14:05.109
Mark Fuhrman.

14:05.111 --> 14:06.978
Total prick.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.379
<i>Really</i> unpleasant.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.148
Johnny never asked him back.

14:10.150 --> 14:12.283
Really? Johnny never
asked him back?

14:12.285 --> 14:14.953
That's interesting.
What, Foreman?

14:14.955 --> 14:16.855
Mark Fuhrman.
Fuhrman. Yeah.

14:16.857 --> 14:19.657
Yeah, dig deep.
Let me know what happens.

14:19.659 --> 14:22.360
HODGMAN:
"Dream team"? Give me a break.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.562
MARCIA:
Bob Shapiro is a settler.

14:24.564 --> 14:27.198

doesn't go to trial.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.900

14:28.902 --> 14:30.401

14:30.403 --> 14:31.703
(laughter)

14:31.705 --> 14:33.504
Did you know Shapiro
represented Bailey

14:33.506 --> 14:36.307
in the longest drunk-driving
trial in American history?

14:36.309 --> 14:38.376
It's true, 11 days.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.078
Dershowitz--
appeals expert,

14:40.080 --> 14:42.080

they're assuming conviction.

did not realize he was a lawyer.

The most famous collection of
expensive lawyers in the world

14:50.190 --> 14:52.156
trying to buy O.J.
out of trouble.

14:52.158 --> 14:54.859
And everyone's
jumping on the gravy train.

14:54.861 --> 14:56.194
Look at this one.

14:56.196 --> 14:57.896
O.J.'s golf caddy has insight

14:57.898 --> 15:00.331

the day of the murders.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.533
If this moron shows up
on a witness list,

15:02.535 --> 15:04.202
one of you gets fired.
(chuckles)

15:04.204 --> 15:05.737
I'm serious.

15:05.739 --> 15:07.939
If they sell their story
before they testify,

15:07.941 --> 15:10.108
they've got zero
credibility on the stand.

15:10.110 --> 15:12.510
We can't have
cash-for-trash.

15:12.512 --> 15:16.381
Come on, Marcia, these are
just honest, hardworking folks

15:16.383 --> 15:19.250

murder of two innocent people.

He sued the city basically
claiming that his duties

from <i>The New Yorker</i> magazine
here to see you.

19:39.646 --> 19:41.846
That on the schedule?

19:41.848 --> 19:43.681
No, he just showed up.

19:43.683 --> 19:46.217
Well, tell him
it doesn't work that way.

19:46.219 --> 19:48.052
Tell him I'm very busy.

19:54.459 --> 19:55.893
(sighs)

19:58.230 --> 20:00.364
♪

20:06.405 --> 20:09.707
Linda, I want to see him.
Don't let him go.

20:11.076 --> 20:13.211
TOOBIN: <i>Thanks for taking</i>
<i>the time to see me.</i>

20:13.213 --> 20:14.812
SHAPIRO: Now, you're
<i>New York</i> magazine

20:14.814 --> 20:16.380
or <i>New Yorker?</i>
<i>New Yorker.</i>

20:16.382 --> 20:17.648
<i>New Yorker.</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

20:17.650 --> 20:19.150
Alan Dershowitz
told me to look you up.

20:19.152 --> 20:20.985
Ah.

20:20.987 --> 20:22.887
I'm doing a piece
on cash-for-trash stories,

20:22.889 --> 20:24.355
witnesses selling
their testimony.

20:24.357 --> 20:26.357
The O.J. Simpson trial
seemed like a perfect...

20:26.359 --> 20:29.093
No, no, it's inconsequential.
It's window dressing.

20:29.095 --> 20:31.095
It's not the best use
of your time.

20:31.097 --> 20:33.331
It's the story I'm out
here to cover, so...

20:33.333 --> 20:36.400
I know it is, but wouldn't you
rather ask me why a man like me

20:36.402 --> 20:37.902
would take a case like this?

20:37.904 --> 20:39.203
You might be surprised.

20:39.205 --> 20:41.239
I might be surprised
if I'm surprised.

20:41.241 --> 20:43.007
Okay. Tell me.

20:43.009 --> 20:44.875
Because of its
far-reaching implications.

20:44.877 --> 20:46.844
I've never seen
anything like it.

20:46.846 --> 20:49.380
And I couldn't stand by
and let it happen. Please.

20:49.382 --> 20:51.649
TOOBIN:
Let what happen, exactly?

20:53.252 --> 20:56.120
The systematic railroading
of O.J. Simpson

20:56.122 --> 21:01.092
by a racist LAPD
because he is a black man.

21:01.094 --> 21:02.560
Wait, what?

21:02.562 --> 21:05.096
The LAPD history is
a shameful history.

21:05.098 --> 21:07.398
And everybody knows it;
it's no secret.

21:07.400 --> 21:10.301
And this cop, Mark Fuhrman,
who discovered everything,

21:10.303 --> 21:13.237
he's an admitted racist.

21:13.239 --> 21:15.473
Any evidence he touches
is questionable.

21:15.475 --> 21:17.275
So I want to be clear.

21:17.277 --> 21:19.610
You're saying this policeman
set up O.J. Simpson.

21:19.612 --> 21:23.247
Maybe. Maybe Mark Fuhrman,
maybe others, in a conspiracy.

21:23.249 --> 21:25.316
Wait. Okay, wait.
So all the blood evidence--

21:25.318 --> 21:27.985
somehow these cops, a cabal
of racist police officers,

21:27.987 --> 21:29.487
planted it?

21:29.489 --> 21:31.555
From the murder scene
to the Bronco

21:31.557 --> 21:33.424
to Rockingham?
Who else could have?

21:33.426 --> 21:34.825
Take a step back.

21:34.827 --> 21:36.460
I mean, doesn't
it seem odd

21:36.462 --> 21:38.763
that this glove just happened
to be at Rockingham

21:38.765 --> 21:41.265
at the same time
that Detective Fuhrman

21:41.267 --> 21:43.000
just happened
to find it?
Uh, it isn't odd

21:43.002 --> 21:44.735
if Simpson dropped it
after he climbed the wall

21:44.737 --> 21:46.270
to avoid being seen
by the limo driver.

21:46.272 --> 21:47.638
Jeff, you look like

21:47.640 --> 21:50.441
a smart kid;
don't rush to judgment.

21:50.443 --> 21:52.510
We will show that
it is impossible

21:52.512 --> 21:56.347
for a black man to get
a fair shake with the LAPD.

21:56.349 --> 21:58.082
We will prove this.

21:58.084 --> 22:00.484
So you're gonna say
this case is all about race?

22:00.486 --> 22:01.919
Yes, because it is.

22:01.921 --> 22:04.155
I'm just simply
shedding a light on it.

22:06.491 --> 22:07.792
(imitates mechanical whirring)

22:07.794 --> 22:09.327
MARCIA: Sweetie,
what are you doing?

22:09.329 --> 22:11.195
Uh, nothing.
(chuckles): Yeah.

22:11.197 --> 22:13.030
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

22:13.032 --> 22:14.699
No. Travis, come on!

22:14.701 --> 22:16.033
No, I can do it.

22:16.035 --> 22:17.601
Yeah, not with
that you can't.

22:17.603 --> 22:19.103
But it's not plugged in.

22:19.105 --> 22:20.538
Well, it's still not safe.

22:20.540 --> 22:22.106
Here. Use that.
Come on.

22:22.108 --> 22:23.708
This isn't fun.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.676
Yeah, well, that way, you'll
hold on to your fingers.

22:25.678 --> 22:27.478
Come on, Mom.
All of your fingers...

22:27.480 --> 22:30.181
SHIVELY (over TV): In the dark,
I could see it was O.J. Simpson.

22:30.183 --> 22:31.682
MALE REPORTER: How would
you describe his expression?

22:31.684 --> 22:34.285
SHIVELY: O.J.'s face
was like a mask of rage.

22:34.287 --> 22:36.320
I was terrified.

22:36.322 --> 22:40.257
I hope I don't have nightmares
for the rest of my life.

22:41.326 --> 22:43.361
MARCIA:
<i>Shively's out.</i>

22:43.363 --> 22:45.396
I'm not putting
her on the stand.
Marcia...

22:45.398 --> 22:47.064
She lied...
She's your only eyewitness.

22:47.066 --> 22:49.500
She ties him to the crime.
She lost all credibility.

22:49.502 --> 22:52.036
The jury won't believe her;
the defense will portray her

22:52.038 --> 22:53.971
as a media whore,
which she is.

22:53.973 --> 22:57.375
They'll say she just made it all
up to score some quick money.

22:57.377 --> 22:59.844
It's just a sleazy
news show.

22:59.846 --> 23:01.712
They paid her five grand.

23:01.714 --> 23:04.181
It's a slippery slope
from <i>Hard Copy</i>

23:04.183 --> 23:06.650
to the <i>National Enquirer</i>
<i>to the</i> <i>Weekly World News.</i>

23:06.652 --> 23:08.185
We need to set a tone.

23:08.187 --> 23:10.087
That what this is about?

23:10.089 --> 23:12.690
We've used witnesses before
who did interviews for money.

23:12.692 --> 23:14.492
Gil.

23:14.494 --> 23:16.227
If we don't keep control,

23:16.229 --> 23:18.996
then the press can hijack
all of it.

23:18.998 --> 23:21.532
We'll end up spending our time
responding to them

23:21.534 --> 23:24.435
instead of focusing
on things that matter.

23:26.037 --> 23:27.405
Come on, guys.

23:27.407 --> 23:29.073
We have all the aces.

23:29.075 --> 23:32.476
Let's hold the high ground.

23:35.881 --> 23:37.515
(door buzzes)

23:50.796 --> 23:52.863
O.J.:
<i>Where's Craig?</i>

23:52.865 --> 23:55.032
(chuckles):
Why hasn't he come seen me yet?

23:55.034 --> 23:58.102
Or any of the other guys
from the golf club.

23:58.104 --> 23:59.770
I'm losing it in here, guys.

23:59.772 --> 24:01.939
They won't even
let me shower.

24:01.941 --> 24:04.875
I got dirt
on my elbows.

24:04.877 --> 24:08.412
Have your people looked
into Faye Resnick yet?

24:08.414 --> 24:10.047
Her drugs?

24:10.049 --> 24:11.782
Underworld
drug connections?

24:11.784 --> 24:15.586
I hear a lot of coke
moves through Mezzaluna.

24:15.588 --> 24:17.455
Uh, cocaine connections?

24:17.457 --> 24:18.789
Yeah.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.591
Sure. We'll put
an investigator on it.

24:20.593 --> 24:23.127
But we have something more
pressing to discuss with you.

24:23.129 --> 24:25.930
We need to add a
litigator to the team,

24:25.932 --> 24:27.798
one who fits the, uh...

24:27.800 --> 24:30.835
well, the particular
developing circumstances

24:30.837 --> 24:32.470
in the downtown venue.

24:32.472 --> 24:34.138
What are you
saying, Bob?

24:34.140 --> 24:36.507
Well, I was thinking
someone along the lines

24:36.509 --> 24:37.842
of Johnnie Cochran.

24:37.844 --> 24:39.443
What?!

24:39.445 --> 24:41.679
No, no, no, that's all wrong.

24:41.681 --> 24:42.980
Just hear him
out, Juice.

24:42.982 --> 24:45.015
We need someone
who can communicate

24:45.017 --> 24:47.651
to the downtown jury.

24:47.653 --> 24:50.488
It's just the, uh...
it's just the conditions

24:50.490 --> 24:52.923
on our football field,
that's all.

24:52.925 --> 24:55.493
You want to make this
a black thing.

24:55.495 --> 24:57.628
That's why you want Cochran.

24:57.630 --> 25:01.499
Well, I'm not black. I'm O.J.

25:01.501 --> 25:02.867
(siren wailing in distance)

25:02.869 --> 25:04.468
COCHRAN:
<i>What is that there?</i>

25:04.470 --> 25:07.037
Okay, well, I've filed
the motion petition...

25:07.039 --> 25:09.507
Come on, Carl,
I-I'm trying to work with this.

25:09.509 --> 25:11.976
I'll tell you what, why don't
we go back to this section?

25:11.978 --> 25:13.277
Okay. What do you got?

25:13.279 --> 25:14.845
What do you got?
(intercom beeps)

25:14.847 --> 25:18.549
Mr. Cochran, O.J. Simpson
is calling for you.

25:18.551 --> 25:20.518
Let me have the room.

25:20.520 --> 25:22.786
Carl, let me have the room.

25:23.889 --> 25:26.257
(door opens, closes)

25:31.563 --> 25:34.098
(panting quietly)

25:43.642 --> 25:44.642
(phone beeps)

25:44.644 --> 25:48.379
Diane, patch him through.

25:48.381 --> 25:51.448
(ringing)

25:53.652 --> 25:55.085
Johnnie Cochran.

25:55.087 --> 25:56.720
Johnnie? Johnnie, this is O.J.

25:56.722 --> 25:57.922
I need you.

25:57.924 --> 25:59.590
I'm calling from jail.

25:59.592 --> 26:01.358
I-I keep telling everyone,

26:01.360 --> 26:03.894
Johnnie Cochran is the man
I need to speak to.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.863
Well, I appreciate that.

26:05.865 --> 26:07.598
I-I keep telling everyone
I'm innocent.

26:07.600 --> 26:10.200
I need the best lawyer in the
world to get me out of this jam.

26:10.202 --> 26:11.535
You got to help me, man.

26:11.537 --> 26:13.003
O.J., I'm glad you called me.

26:13.005 --> 26:15.439
You've made a smart decision.

26:15.441 --> 26:16.774
I sure did.

26:16.776 --> 26:19.243
'Cause I killed her.
(snickering)

26:19.245 --> 26:21.812
I killed her good. Oh, yeah.

26:22.781 --> 26:24.748
(slams phone down)
Diane...

26:24.750 --> 26:27.818
next time screen the damn call!

26:42.934 --> 26:45.436
KATO: It's weird. I was always
so tight with the Simpsons;

26:45.438 --> 26:47.204
now they say they need
their guesthouse back.

26:47.206 --> 26:49.073
Dude, it's not a problem.

26:49.075 --> 26:51.775
You can stay on my couch
as long as you want.

26:51.777 --> 26:54.078
You, my friend,
are a total pussy magnet.

26:54.080 --> 26:56.547
It's crazy. Ever since
this stuff, you know,

26:56.549 --> 26:58.449
my beeper's going off
50 times a day.

26:58.451 --> 27:00.451
TV shows, girls, agents,

27:00.453 --> 27:02.753
managers-- it's crazy.
You got any good auditions?

27:02.755 --> 27:05.556
I mean, you must be getting
offered a ton of parts, right?

27:05.558 --> 27:08.158
Well, not really, but I don't
want to blow this opportunity.

27:08.160 --> 27:10.127
I have to update my reel.

27:10.129 --> 27:12.096
I only have that Coke commercial
from '86.

27:12.098 --> 27:13.764
(laughs):
Oh, yeah.

27:13.766 --> 27:15.966
(horn honking)
WOMEN: Kato! Kato! Kato!

27:15.968 --> 27:17.968
(whooping)

27:17.970 --> 27:19.436
KATO (laughs):
Oh, look!

27:19.438 --> 27:20.804
Whoo-whoo-whoo!

27:20.806 --> 27:22.773
(whooping)

27:22.775 --> 27:24.274
They're so friendly!

27:24.276 --> 27:26.644
You've got the life.

27:26.646 --> 27:28.979
MAN:
Hey, Kato! Hey, asshole!
Hey, la...

27:28.981 --> 27:31.382
Go straight to hell
with O.J., murderer!

27:38.356 --> 27:40.024
Fame's complicated.

27:40.026 --> 27:41.392
(chuckles)

27:50.769 --> 27:52.936
(phone ringing)

27:52.938 --> 27:56.206
A.D.A. Darden,
Special Investigations Division.

27:57.509 --> 27:59.476
Oh, actually,
this office is in charge

27:59.478 --> 28:01.512
of investigating
all LAPD officers.

28:01.514 --> 28:03.547
How can I help you?

28:06.351 --> 28:08.052
Uh-huh.

28:09.154 --> 28:11.689
Uh... yeah, right. Okay.

28:11.691 --> 28:15.225
What's the name
of that detective again?

28:15.227 --> 28:16.560
(elevator bell dings)

28:28.506 --> 28:30.541
How you doing today?

28:30.543 --> 28:32.509
Get the passenger manifests
for both Chicago flights,

28:32.511 --> 28:35.312
see if anyone can attest
to Simpson's demeanor.

28:35.314 --> 28:37.214
Yes. That is fine.
He can sign it.

28:37.216 --> 28:39.883
And please close the door on
your way out, Lisa. Thank you.

28:39.885 --> 28:41.919
Knock-knock.
Hey, Big-Time.

28:41.921 --> 28:44.722
Darden. Sorry I can't
offer you a chair.

28:44.724 --> 28:47.157
What's up?
I got a call.

28:47.159 --> 28:49.927
Reporter from <i>The New Yorker</i>
<i>asking about Mark Fuhrman.</i>

28:49.929 --> 28:52.896
I know he's a key
witness for you, so...
Mm-hmm.

28:52.898 --> 28:55.766
I just thought you should know.
I sandbagged him.

28:55.768 --> 28:58.102
Told him it would take
a week to get the file.
Nice.

28:58.104 --> 29:00.104
Would you do me a favor
and shut the door?

29:00.106 --> 29:02.172
I need a break.

29:04.242 --> 29:06.076
You mind?

29:06.078 --> 29:07.945
No.

29:15.220 --> 29:17.788
What do you think
about the case?

29:17.790 --> 29:20.724
It's pretty bulletproof. Strong.

29:20.726 --> 29:22.259
Though it's interesting.

29:22.261 --> 29:24.828
A lot of black people
think O.J. didn't do it.

29:27.532 --> 29:28.999
What?

29:30.702 --> 29:31.969
Really?
Yeah.

29:31.971 --> 29:33.470
Guess they just
don't want it

29:33.472 --> 29:34.772
to be true.

29:34.774 --> 29:36.140
You know,
good-looking, charming,

29:36.142 --> 29:38.242
talented black kid
from the street makes it

29:38.244 --> 29:41.411
all the way to the top, then
gets pushed off his pedestal

29:41.413 --> 29:43.480
and thrown into jail,
like black men do.

29:43.482 --> 29:45.215
Oh, come on.

29:45.217 --> 29:48.218
It's not like O.J. was a pillar
of the black community.

29:48.220 --> 29:49.453
Mm.

29:49.455 --> 29:52.156
Well, and even if he were,
would it matter?

29:52.158 --> 29:54.158
There would still be
the same evidence,

29:54.160 --> 29:56.393
the same history,
the same facts.

29:58.329 --> 30:00.230
He obviously did it.
(sighs)
I hear you.

30:00.232 --> 30:02.900
But right now, it's
an emotional thing,

30:02.902 --> 30:04.735
not a rational one.

30:06.504 --> 30:07.805
(sighs)

30:07.807 --> 30:10.440
Might be hard for
you to understand.

30:10.442 --> 30:12.876
Since you never get
emotional about your cases.

30:17.482 --> 30:19.550
(chuckles)

30:27.792 --> 30:29.126
(doorbell rings)

30:29.128 --> 30:31.028
ROB (in distance):
Dad's here!

30:31.030 --> 30:33.497
KHLOE: I need to find my coat!
ROB: I can't find my shoe!

30:33.499 --> 30:34.798
(kids continue chattering)

30:34.800 --> 30:36.600
Hey. How are you?
Wait here.

30:36.602 --> 30:38.802
Okay? I'll get them.
Whoa, what's-what's wrong?

30:38.804 --> 30:40.637
You guys have a
movie to get to.

30:40.639 --> 30:42.806
I don't really want to
get into this right now.

30:42.808 --> 30:44.274
What? No, come on.

30:44.276 --> 30:47.010
No, we don't let stuff go
like that.

30:47.012 --> 30:50.013
No, we don't.
You're right.

30:50.015 --> 30:52.883
Jesus, how do you
expect me to act?

30:52.885 --> 30:54.952
When you're
standing by him.

30:54.954 --> 30:56.553
He's my best friend, Kris.

30:56.555 --> 30:58.322
I don't turn my back on people.

30:58.324 --> 31:00.724
You're turning your back
on Nicole!

31:00.726 --> 31:02.326
He butchered her, Robert.
He murdered her!

31:02.328 --> 31:04.628
O-Okay. Look, come on.

31:04.630 --> 31:07.531
Come on, I'm-I'm devastated
about Nicole.

31:07.533 --> 31:09.366
You know that.

31:09.368 --> 31:10.634
I mean, it's-it's horrible.

31:10.636 --> 31:12.536
But he had nothing
to do with that.

31:12.538 --> 31:14.538
I know that.
Bullshit!

31:14.540 --> 31:18.075
You can tell yourself that,
but you do not know that.

31:20.511 --> 31:22.646
Would you at least
please not tell the kids

31:22.648 --> 31:24.481
that their uncle is a killer?

31:24.483 --> 31:27.050
Pretend uncle, Robert.

31:27.052 --> 31:29.019
Everything about him is pretend.

31:29.021 --> 31:30.888
(door opens)

31:30.890 --> 31:32.089
(kids chattering)

31:32.091 --> 31:33.557
Guys, your
father's here.

31:33.559 --> 31:35.425
(door closes)

31:43.101 --> 31:44.268
You rang?

31:44.270 --> 31:46.169
Yep. Come on in.

31:47.872 --> 31:49.907
Hypothetical question.
Hmm?

31:49.909 --> 31:52.776
What do you think about A.C.
Cowlings aiding and abetting?

31:52.778 --> 31:54.845
Really?
Mm-hmm.

31:54.847 --> 31:56.213
Well, it's complicated.

31:56.215 --> 31:57.881
On one hand, he was the driver

31:57.883 --> 31:59.616
in what looked like
Simpson's getaway attempt.

31:59.618 --> 32:01.184
There was passports,

32:01.186 --> 32:03.887
fake beard,
$8,700 in cash.
Mm-hmm.

32:03.889 --> 32:06.590
Refused to stop the vehicle
for police when ordered.

32:06.592 --> 32:09.626
On the other hand, Simpson was
holding a gun to his own head.

32:09.628 --> 32:11.528
He may have pointed it
at Cowlings.

32:11.530 --> 32:13.130
I guess it comes down
to establishing

32:13.132 --> 32:15.432
what the situation was
inside that vehicle.

32:15.434 --> 32:17.067
Why?

32:17.069 --> 32:19.036
Because we're thinking
about pressing charges.

32:19.038 --> 32:20.938
Oh.
I've known you forever,

32:20.940 --> 32:22.606
and I think you're the one
to run with it.

32:22.608 --> 32:25.375
You do? Wow.
Mm-hmm.

32:25.377 --> 32:26.777
Huh.
You should do it.

32:26.779 --> 32:28.612
You'll have fun.

32:28.614 --> 32:32.449
Marcia, I haven't been in
a courtroom in a long time.

32:32.451 --> 32:34.551
Quit hiding
in the basement, Chris.

32:34.553 --> 32:36.486
I know you can do it.

32:36.488 --> 32:37.821
Is that right, Big-Time?

32:37.823 --> 32:39.489
Yeah. You should trust me.

32:39.491 --> 32:41.391
Look, I know it doesn't
seem like much now,

32:41.393 --> 32:43.060
but it could turn out
to be crucial

32:43.062 --> 32:44.728
to proving O.J.'s
intent and guilt.

32:44.730 --> 32:46.496
And that would be all yours.

32:46.498 --> 32:47.898
Big-Time.

32:49.067 --> 32:50.801
Well...

32:50.803 --> 32:52.903
I guess I'm all yours, Marcia.

32:52.905 --> 32:54.104
Good.

32:54.106 --> 32:55.772
(laughs)

32:55.774 --> 32:58.241
Because I could use
all the help I can get.

32:58.243 --> 32:59.576
WOMAN: Marcia?
Yeah?

32:59.578 --> 33:01.311
You got to come out
and see this.

33:01.313 --> 33:02.813
NICOLE (over TV):
He's back. Please.

33:02.815 --> 33:04.614
DISPATCHER:
Okay, what does he look like?

33:04.616 --> 33:06.583
NICOLE: He's O.J. Simpson.
I think you know his record.

33:06.585 --> 33:09.119
Could you just send
somebody over here?

33:09.121 --> 33:11.121
DISPATCHER:
Okay, what is he doing there?

33:11.123 --> 33:12.422
Are these the 911 tapes?

33:12.424 --> 33:14.157
Yeah. The media
made a request,

33:14.159 --> 33:15.993
and some idiot at
county released them.

33:15.995 --> 33:17.794
NICOLE: First of all, he broke
the back door down to get in.

33:17.796 --> 33:19.262
DISPATCHER:
Okay, wait a minute.

33:19.264 --> 33:20.864
What is he doing?
Is he threatening you?

33:20.866 --> 33:22.833
NICOLE (crying):
I am freakin' going nuts.

33:22.835 --> 33:24.334
DISPATCHER:
Okay, just stay on the line...

33:24.336 --> 33:25.969
NICOLE: I don't want
to stay on the line.

33:25.971 --> 33:27.270
He's gonna beat the shit
out of me.

33:27.272 --> 33:28.638
Oh, my God.

33:28.640 --> 33:30.007
DISPATCHER: ...so we can know
what's going on

33:30.009 --> 33:31.141
till the police get there, okay?

33:31.143 --> 33:32.609
<i>Just a moment.</i>

33:32.611 --> 33:33.710
<i>Does he have any weapons?</i>

33:33.712 --> 33:35.178
NICOLE:
<i>I don't know.</i>

33:35.180 --> 33:37.047
DISPATCHER: <i>Has he hit you</i>
<i>today or no?</i>
<i>No.</i>

33:37.049 --> 33:38.882
DISPATCHER: Okay, you don't need
any paramedics or anything?

33:38.884 --> 33:40.350
NICOLE:
Uh-uh.

33:40.352 --> 33:42.019
(O.J. shouting indistinctly)

33:42.021 --> 33:44.187
DISPATCHER:
Is he inside right now?
NICOLE: Yes.

33:44.189 --> 33:45.689
DISPATCHER:
Okay, just a moment.

33:45.691 --> 33:47.157
MARCIA:
<i>This is exactly</i>

33:47.159 --> 33:49.326
what I feared.

33:49.328 --> 33:51.361
The tail wagging
the dog.

33:51.363 --> 33:52.829
My witnesses are on TV.

33:52.831 --> 33:54.197
My evidence
is on TV.

33:54.199 --> 33:55.832
Hey, maybe we should
invite Bernard Shaw over

33:55.834 --> 33:57.234
to rifle through my files.

33:57.236 --> 33:58.668
Marcia, we'll come through.

33:58.670 --> 34:01.805
We have enough evidence
to win five times over.

34:01.807 --> 34:03.907
When Shapiro sees
what we've got,

34:03.909 --> 34:05.976
he's gonna roll over
and play dead.

34:12.417 --> 34:14.551
♪

34:22.160 --> 34:24.094
Thank you, sir.

34:41.279 --> 34:43.246
I hear a sound.

34:43.248 --> 34:45.882
The sound...

34:45.884 --> 34:48.718
of metal orbs clanging
against one another.

34:48.720 --> 34:50.787
(chuckles):
Come on, Lee.

34:53.591 --> 34:56.226
Oh, my God.

34:56.228 --> 34:58.228
It's coming from
your pants, Bob.

34:58.230 --> 35:00.530
(laughs)
Balls.

35:01.699 --> 35:03.600
Big, brass balls.

35:03.602 --> 35:05.068
God love you.

35:05.070 --> 35:07.270
We are back in this thing!
(pounds desk)

35:07.272 --> 35:08.872
Ah, thank you, thank you.

35:08.874 --> 35:12.375
But, uh, how do I get rid
of those 911 tapes?

35:12.377 --> 35:13.944
I know.

35:13.946 --> 35:15.645
Those tapes are today.

35:15.647 --> 35:17.614
In a week,
they're flotsam over the stern.

35:17.616 --> 35:19.149
If they had to come out,

35:19.151 --> 35:21.084
I'm glad they were
followed with this.

35:21.086 --> 35:24.754
What you've laid out here,
this is an entire case strategy.

35:24.756 --> 35:26.223
Spectacular.

35:26.225 --> 35:28.925
This is masterful.

35:28.927 --> 35:32.295
Bob, you had a car
that flew off a cliff.

35:32.297 --> 35:34.731
It's missing two
tires, leaking oil

35:34.733 --> 35:37.134
and flung into a
ravine, yet somehow,

35:37.136 --> 35:40.504
you drove us back up the hill.

35:40.506 --> 35:43.273
We're highway-ready again
and back in the race.

35:43.275 --> 35:45.475
MARCIA:
<i>What is it</i>

35:45.477 --> 35:46.843
with this case?

35:46.845 --> 35:48.979
Every time I think
I get my bearings...

35:48.981 --> 35:50.914
It's crazy.
They're going racial.

35:50.916 --> 35:53.183
You know,
I think this could stick.

35:53.185 --> 35:56.019
No way. Nobody's
gonna buy into this.

35:56.021 --> 35:58.321
It's desperate,
transparent,

35:58.323 --> 35:59.923
and coming from
"Brentwood" Bob Shapiro.

35:59.925 --> 36:02.993
I know a lot of people
who would believe it.

36:08.766 --> 36:10.167
Darden's right.

36:10.169 --> 36:12.369
This move may be
sleazy and cynical,

36:12.371 --> 36:13.970
but it could work.

36:13.972 --> 36:17.140
They're trying
to take down the LAPD.

36:17.142 --> 36:20.343
We have to stop looking
at this case as a slam dunk.

36:20.345 --> 36:21.878
This article--

36:21.880 --> 36:24.848
it's a declaration of war.

36:27.185 --> 36:29.186
KARDASHIAN:
<i>Then Dershowitz says,</i>

36:29.188 --> 36:32.122
"Once I decide to take a case,
I have only one agenda:

36:32.124 --> 36:33.790
"I want to win.
Mm!

36:33.792 --> 36:36.159
"I will try
by every fair and legal means

36:36.161 --> 36:39.663
to get my client off without
regard to the consequences."

36:39.665 --> 36:41.264
O.J.:
Mm.

36:43.367 --> 36:46.403
So they're saying
that this racist cop framed me

36:46.405 --> 36:48.138
just because I'm black?!

36:48.140 --> 36:50.173
It could explain
a lot, Juice.

36:50.175 --> 36:53.643
I mean, th-this Fuhrman cop
and-and the glove.

36:53.645 --> 36:56.379
And why not do everything
we can to get you out of here

36:56.381 --> 36:58.415
if-if you're not
supposed to be here?

36:58.417 --> 37:00.817
I just want to go home,
be with my children,

37:00.819 --> 37:03.720
do everything that I can to help
find the killer, you know?

37:03.722 --> 37:06.890
O.J., these 911 tapes
that have been circulating,

37:06.892 --> 37:09.526
they've been playing day and
night on all the channels,

37:09.528 --> 37:12.729
it's an audio recording
in which the world can hear you

37:12.731 --> 37:14.764
beating your wife.
Bob,

37:14.766 --> 37:17.000
we was just, you know, tussling.

37:17.002 --> 37:18.535
I-I can... I can fix this.

37:18.537 --> 37:20.570
No, no, no, you can't!
You can't clear that up!

37:20.572 --> 37:22.939
You can't put the genie
back in the bottle.

37:22.941 --> 37:25.041
Now, there's hope,
but you have to listen,

37:25.043 --> 37:27.210
and you have to listen
very carefully.

37:27.212 --> 37:30.247
This race defense
is the crux of our case.

37:30.249 --> 37:31.848
We need to bring in
Johnnie Cochran,

37:31.850 --> 37:33.416
and we need to do it now!

37:33.418 --> 37:34.417
No.
Yes, we do.

37:34.419 --> 37:36.052
His angle is
the only angle

37:36.054 --> 37:39.022
that you will ever see
daylight again, do you hear me?

37:39.024 --> 37:41.625
Do you hear me?!

37:41.627 --> 37:43.760
He's right, Juice.

37:46.430 --> 37:48.965
(phone ringing)

37:51.535 --> 37:54.204
(phone continues ringing)

38:06.250 --> 38:07.817
Johnnie Cochran.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.729
Let me say this.
I've always admired you

38:19.731 --> 38:21.665
and wanted to work
with you for years.

38:21.667 --> 38:23.633
Thank you, Bob.
That's kind of you.

38:23.635 --> 38:27.837
I feel a strong emotional
connection to this case.

38:27.839 --> 38:30.240
I'm so glad you
feel this way.

38:30.242 --> 38:31.841
It's excellent.

38:31.843 --> 38:35.312
But I-I... I feel that I
owe you the utmost clarity

38:35.314 --> 38:36.813
on one issue.
Mm-hmm.

38:36.815 --> 38:38.148
Hmm.

38:38.150 --> 38:41.084
And that is, I will
remain lead counsel.

38:45.022 --> 38:47.857
Mm.

38:47.859 --> 38:50.760
This case could accomplish
a lot of important things.

38:50.762 --> 38:53.196
(laughs): I know.
I'm so excited.

38:53.198 --> 38:54.931
I'm excited for you, for us.
It's big. It's big.

38:54.933 --> 38:56.466
Bob, Bob, Bob,
hang on, hang on, hang on.

38:56.468 --> 38:58.501
Before I come aboard...
Yes?

38:58.503 --> 38:59.936
Yeah?

38:59.938 --> 39:01.971
I have to look
into O.J.'s eyes.

39:01.973 --> 39:03.340
I have to look into his eyes.

39:03.342 --> 39:05.742
I need to believe him.

39:13.651 --> 39:15.552
(door buzzes)

39:21.492 --> 39:23.560
(door closes)

39:27.832 --> 39:29.899
(door buzzes)

39:46.150 --> 39:47.550
You all right,
my brother?

39:47.552 --> 39:48.918
No, Johnnie. No.

39:48.920 --> 39:50.653
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

39:50.655 --> 39:52.722
Talk to me.

40:02.366 --> 40:06.870
Whatever you decide to do,
whether you're with me or not,

40:06.872 --> 40:09.072
you got to know this...

40:11.108 --> 40:12.909
(sobs quietly)

40:12.911 --> 40:15.412
(crying):
I loved her.

40:15.414 --> 40:19.115
I loved Nicole more than
you can possibly imagine.

40:19.117 --> 40:22.919
Sh-She was the mother
of my children.

40:22.921 --> 40:26.589
I... I didn't do it, Johnnie.

40:26.591 --> 40:28.458
I didn't. I didn't do...

40:28.460 --> 40:30.093
