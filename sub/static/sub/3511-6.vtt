00:10.093 --> 00:14.246
Captain, new contact on long range 
sensors. Creaver battleship closing fast.

00:14.247 --> 00:15.886
Demagnify.

00:16.204 --> 00:17.417
Oracle...

00:17.418 --> 00:19.807
Chances for crew survival if we engage?

00:19.808 --> 00:21.529
Our weapons systems are disabled.

00:21.530 --> 00:24.047
The alien vessel has superior firepower.

00:24.048 --> 00:27.635
Chances of survival... 0.1%.

00:28.215 --> 00:30.328
That's a rosy prediction.

00:32.081 --> 00:34.055
We will live to fight another day.

00:34.138 --> 00:35.271
Prepare for flash warp.

00:35.272 --> 00:36.832
Captain Max, Lieutenant Chloe

00:36.833 --> 00:38.740
hasn't teleported back from Ariel's moon.

00:38.741 --> 00:40.486
Hold flash warp.

00:41.028 --> 00:42.309
We're not leaving without her.

00:42.310 --> 00:44.563
But, sir, if we don't warp in time,

00:44.564 --> 00:46.167
all of humanity will be lost.

00:46.168 --> 00:48.061
And if we don't wait for Lieutenant Chloe,

00:48.062 --> 00:50.310
our humanity will be lost.

00:50.311 --> 00:53.143
Captain, the Creavers
have fired ion torpedoes.

00:53.144 --> 00:54.977
Shields up. Man battle stations.

00:54.978 --> 00:56.505
Impact in nine seconds.

00:56.506 --> 00:58.006
Status on Lieutenant Chloe.

00:58.007 --> 01:00.318
She teleported, sir.
She's back on our ship.

01:00.319 --> 01:01.490
Initiate flash warp.

01:01.491 --> 01:04.897
Warping in three, two... one.

01:10.743 --> 01:12.259
Warp successful.

01:15.509 --> 01:17.569
Lieutenant Chloe, you're back.

01:17.570 --> 01:19.753
And so is my Thorian blaster.

01:19.754 --> 01:21.024
Ohh!
No!

01:22.802 --> 01:24.370
Why?

01:24.695 --> 01:26.556
I'm with the Creavers now.

01:28.097 --> 01:30.017
And this ship...

01:31.178 --> 01:33.561
Is under my command.

01:34.435 --> 01:36.614
Whoo!

01:38.156 --> 01:40.312
That was so freakin' cool.

01:40.584 --> 01:43.643
Thank you for serving under me today

01:43.644 --> 01:45.827
on the "Nebula-9" fan experience.

01:45.828 --> 01:47.450
Please return to the dressing rooms

01:47.451 --> 01:49.455
and leave your uniforms with the attendant.

01:49.456 --> 01:51.209
And may fortune...

01:51.442 --> 01:53.515
Guide your journey.

01:58.484 --> 02:00.631
Check out the oracle pod.

02:01.999 --> 02:04.646
Man, the oracle looks so real.

02:05.444 --> 02:07.296
I think she is real.

02:07.902 --> 02:09.836
And I think she's dead.

02:11.000 --> 02:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:23.564 --> 02:25.262
And here you go.

02:25.263 --> 02:27.106
Thanks. I'm your number-one fan.

02:27.107 --> 02:28.554
Thanks for coming.

02:28.951 --> 02:30.635
How far they fall.

02:31.647 --> 02:33.287
All right.
Where do you want it?

02:33.288 --> 02:35.015
Could you sign my chest?

02:35.231 --> 02:38.206
Wow. That actually caught your attention.

02:38.445 --> 02:39.398
What are you doing here?

02:39.399 --> 02:41.213
You'd know if you'd answer your phone.

02:41.214 --> 02:44.273
Listen, if you want your very own
signed copy of "Storm Season,"

02:44.274 --> 02:46.915
I'd be happy to arrange a private signing.

02:46.916 --> 02:49.114
Cap your pen, Castle.
There's been a murder here.

02:49.115 --> 02:50.986
- Here at SupernovaCon?
- Mm-hmm.

02:51.402 --> 02:52.368
Shiny.

02:52.369 --> 02:53.433
You gotta admit,

02:53.434 --> 02:55.658
this is a genius place to commit a murder.

02:55.659 --> 02:57.006
I mean, you don a costume,

02:57.007 --> 02:58.363
strike down your intended target,

02:58.364 --> 03:00.511
and then melt into the crowd unseen.

03:00.512 --> 03:02.495
You sound like you've actually
thought about this, Castle.

03:02.496 --> 03:03.892
I used to come here a lot.

03:03.893 --> 03:06.190
Alexis and I would come here
every year and dress up.

03:06.191 --> 03:06.998
You should've seen her,

03:06.999 --> 03:08.925
like a little pint-sized princess Leia.

03:08.926 --> 03:09.785
And you were?

03:09.786 --> 03:11.814
Oh, Darth Vader, of course.

03:12.134 --> 03:13.676
So who is our victim?

03:13.677 --> 03:15.342
Did Doc Ock finally catch
up with Spider-Man?

03:15.343 --> 03:17.034
Think more TV starship.

03:17.035 --> 03:19.241
- Oh! Um, borg attack.
- Mnh-mnh.

03:19.242 --> 03:21.103
Cylon skinjob?
Please say Number Six.

03:21.104 --> 03:22.652
Nope.
"Nebula-9."

03:22.653 --> 03:24.046
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

03:24.246 --> 03:27.069
I'm sorry. How is "Nebula-9"
worthy of all this?

03:27.070 --> 03:29.378
I mean, they were canceled
over a decade ago

03:29.379 --> 03:32.934
after 12 episodes, which
was 12 episodes too many.

03:32.935 --> 03:34.356
I thought you would be a fan.

03:34.357 --> 03:36.067
I'm a fan of good Sci-Fi...

03:36.068 --> 03:37.823
"Star Trek," "Battlestar,"

03:37.824 --> 03:39.094
that Joss Whedon show.

03:39.095 --> 03:40.894
But "Nebula-9"?
No, no.

03:40.895 --> 03:43.867
It's all phony melodrama
and lifeless acting.

03:46.978 --> 03:48.418
Wow.

03:50.846 --> 03:52.543
Okay, this is a cool ship.

03:52.544 --> 03:54.842
The show is still lame,
but this is a cool ship.

03:54.932 --> 03:56.149
- Yo.
- Hey.

03:56.150 --> 03:57.581
So who's our vic?

03:57.582 --> 04:00.194
Anabelle Collins. She's, uh, 28.

04:00.195 --> 04:02.906
Looks like she was killed and
then stashed in that pod.

04:02.907 --> 04:04.931
She's the one who put together
this whole "Nebula-9"

04:04.932 --> 04:06.674
fan experience re-enactment thing.

04:06.675 --> 04:09.211
An impressive if misguided effort.

04:09.284 --> 04:10.291
With you, bro.

04:10.292 --> 04:11.346
Give me "Blade Runner"...

04:11.347 --> 04:13.871
a bleak, dystopian future
with sexy replicants.

04:13.872 --> 04:15.456
Right?
How about you, Beckett?

04:15.457 --> 04:16.415
What do you...

04:16.416 --> 04:17.887
Have you found next of kin?

04:17.889 --> 04:19.812
Actually on my way to do that.

04:20.697 --> 04:22.856
Perlmutter, good to see you.

04:22.857 --> 04:25.521
Ah, if only the feeling were mutual.

04:25.522 --> 04:27.376
So when was she killed?

04:27.377 --> 04:28.510
Well, based on liver temp,

04:28.511 --> 04:31.140
last night between 10:00 and 11:00 P.M.

04:31.141 --> 04:33.545
The bigger issue is how she was killed.

04:34.008 --> 04:35.979
Now I believe death came by way

04:35.980 --> 04:37.348
of this rather fascinating

04:37.349 --> 04:39.532
small-diameter puncture to her heart.

04:39.533 --> 04:40.414
Stab wound.

04:40.415 --> 04:42.286
Oh, Castle, think. How would that explain

04:42.287 --> 04:44.845
the first-degree burns on
the skin around the wound?

04:44.846 --> 04:46.840
That could be powder burns
from a close-range gunshot.

04:46.841 --> 04:49.154
Yeah, but the burns should
have gunpowder stippling,

04:49.155 --> 04:51.224
particulates seared into the flesh.

04:51.225 --> 04:53.652
Uh, not only that, there
would be blood spatter.

04:53.653 --> 04:55.409
So what caused the wound?

04:57.195 --> 04:57.889
No clue.

04:57.890 --> 04:59.306
Never seen anything quite like it.

04:59.307 --> 05:01.585
I should know more once
I get her on the slab.

05:03.776 --> 05:04.729
Hey.

05:04.730 --> 05:06.531
So I just finished taking
witnesses' statements.

05:06.532 --> 05:08.667
Uh, none of these folks knew the victim

05:08.668 --> 05:10.033
or were here during the time of death.

05:10.034 --> 05:11.959
Yeah, we're gonna have to
find witnesses that were.

05:11.960 --> 05:13.375
Someone must have seen the killer

05:13.376 --> 05:14.844
entering or leaving the ship last night.

05:14.845 --> 05:16.081
Yeah, but how would we locate them?

05:16.082 --> 05:17.596
There's thousands of people here.

05:17.597 --> 05:18.587
You know what?
You could leave a message

05:18.588 --> 05:19.910
on the "Nebula-9" fan site

05:19.911 --> 05:21.256
asking for anyone that was here

05:21.257 --> 05:22.930
between 10:00 and 11:00 last night.

05:22.931 --> 05:24.001
And just let them know that
you're gonna meet them

05:24.002 --> 05:25.440
at the front of the ship.

05:26.110 --> 05:27.876
"Nebula-9" fan site?

05:28.067 --> 05:29.064
Yeah.

05:29.065 --> 05:32.781
I understand that they
have a very loyal fan...

05:34.849 --> 05:36.325
Fan base.

05:37.161 --> 05:38.418
Is that...

05:38.419 --> 05:42.015
Gabriel Winters, A.K.A. the
real captain Max Rennard.

05:42.016 --> 05:43.732
He knew the victim.

05:44.913 --> 05:45.974
And?

05:45.975 --> 05:47.324
Oh, I tried to talk to him,

05:47.325 --> 05:48.450
but he said he needed a minute

05:48.451 --> 05:52.268
to "muse upon the fragile
nature of human life."

05:52.269 --> 05:54.047
Well, his minute is up.

05:55.321 --> 05:56.692
Hi.
Um...

05:56.693 --> 05:59.652
Mr. Winters, I'm, uh,
Detective Kate Beckett and...

05:59.653 --> 06:01.163
I'm devastated,

06:01.809 --> 06:03.598
ravaged by sorrow.

06:03.599 --> 06:05.689
I'm reminded of the moment
when first officer Tate

06:05.690 --> 06:08.391
was sucked into that
wormhole in episode six.

06:08.392 --> 06:11.572
Except in this case, someone actually died.

06:11.573 --> 06:12.711
Yeah.

06:12.712 --> 06:14.535
Now I understand that you knew Anabelle.

06:14.536 --> 06:16.572
Do you have any idea who
could've done this to her?

06:16.573 --> 06:17.752
No idea.

06:17.753 --> 06:20.530
Anabelle was spectacular in every way.

06:20.531 --> 06:22.012
When "Nebula-9" was canceled...

06:22.013 --> 06:24.381
unjustly, I might add...

06:24.382 --> 06:26.532
she kept interest in the show alive.

06:26.533 --> 06:28.480
How will I go on without her?

06:29.161 --> 06:30.830
Go on living?

06:30.941 --> 06:33.144
Go on doing the fan experience.

06:34.012 --> 06:36.232
She contacted me a few months ago,

06:36.233 --> 06:38.033
asked me to be a part of this.

06:38.034 --> 06:42.012
I was thrilled to give back
to the "Nebula-9" community.

06:42.013 --> 06:44.056
When was the last time you saw her?

06:44.461 --> 06:45.857
About 9:00 last night,

06:45.858 --> 06:47.262
after the fan experience ended.

06:47.263 --> 06:49.862
Then I went back to my hotel,
stayed in for the night.

06:49.863 --> 06:51.756
Last time I saw Anabelle,

06:51.757 --> 06:53.650
she was alone on the bridge.

06:54.873 --> 06:58.151
And may fortune... guide her journey.

06:58.872 --> 07:00.596
But the show must go on.

07:00.597 --> 07:02.672
When do you think we can get
this back up and running?

07:02.673 --> 07:03.547
Soon?

07:03.548 --> 07:05.136
Ish?

07:05.311 --> 07:05.857
We'll let you know.

07:05.858 --> 07:06.513
In the meantime,

07:06.514 --> 07:08.402
did you know any of
Anabelle's family members?

07:08.403 --> 07:09.850
Nah.

07:09.881 --> 07:12.107
But her friends Audrey and Davis

07:12.108 --> 07:14.950
run the "Nebula-9" booth down on the floor.

07:16.590 --> 07:18.214
Dismissed.

07:22.085 --> 07:24.296
It's just so awful.

07:24.297 --> 07:27.462
She's been my best friend
since high school.

07:27.942 --> 07:29.573
She introduced me to Davis.

07:29.574 --> 07:31.380
She's the reason we're together.

07:31.381 --> 07:32.715
Yeah, we bonded over "Nebula-9."

07:32.716 --> 07:34.414
We all loved the show.

07:34.415 --> 07:37.276
So... when Anabelle started the fan club,

07:37.277 --> 07:37.910
we helped out.

07:37.911 --> 07:39.882
And it just kind of took off from there.

07:39.883 --> 07:41.748
Did you notice any unusual behavior?

07:41.749 --> 07:44.262
I saw her yesterday morning,
and she seemed really upset.

07:44.263 --> 07:45.919
- About what?
- I don't know.

07:45.920 --> 07:48.979
All she said was that someone she
had trusted had betrayed her.

07:48.980 --> 07:51.330
Any idea who?
Was she involved with anyone?

07:51.331 --> 07:52.690
Not that I know of.

07:52.691 --> 07:54.537
Did Anabelle have any enemies?

07:54.538 --> 07:57.345
There were those fans, the ones
that sent all the threats.

07:57.346 --> 07:58.489
What threats?

07:58.490 --> 08:01.001
After the fan club took
off, Anabelle bought

08:01.002 --> 08:03.112
the rights to the show
for practically nothing

08:03.113 --> 08:05.850
and started making new "Nebula-9" webisodes

08:05.851 --> 08:07.151
starring the three of us.

08:07.152 --> 08:08.676
You know, picking up
where the show left off,

08:08.677 --> 08:09.881
like as a tribute.

08:09.882 --> 08:11.300
Not everyone saw it that way.

08:11.301 --> 08:14.455
Anabelle got some pretty ugly e-mails.

08:14.536 --> 08:15.720
How ugly?

08:15.721 --> 08:17.912
Some were death threats.

08:19.191 --> 08:20.969
Boy, Davis wasn't kidding
about these e-mails.

08:20.970 --> 08:22.003
Listen to this.

08:22.004 --> 08:23.357
"Your so-called webisodes

08:23.358 --> 08:25.298
"desecrate the memory of 'Nebula-9'

08:25.299 --> 08:27.167
and you should pay the ultimate price."

08:27.168 --> 08:27.900
I don't know, Castle.

08:27.901 --> 08:29.721
Do you honestly believe
that Anabelle was killed

08:29.722 --> 08:31.647
by an angry "Nebula-9" fan?

08:31.648 --> 08:33.421
I think if you like "Nebula-9,"

08:33.422 --> 08:34.880
you're crazy enough to kill, yeah.

08:34.881 --> 08:35.712
Whoa.

08:35.714 --> 08:37.600
Why are you so down on the show?

08:37.601 --> 08:38.549
Uh, okay, well, let's see,

08:38.551 --> 08:39.674
because it's cheesy,

08:39.674 --> 08:40.931
it ignores the laws of physics...

08:40.932 --> 08:42.304
And good storytelling,
not to mention...

08:42.304 --> 08:44.120
Okay, I got it.

08:44.801 --> 08:46.973
- It's Perlmutter. He's got something for us.
- Mm.

08:46.974 --> 08:48.971
Kate Beckett?!

08:49.076 --> 08:50.484
K-Bex!

08:50.485 --> 08:52.363
I knew it was you.

08:52.955 --> 08:55.168
Oh, Henry Barnett.
Wow.

08:55.169 --> 08:57.279
It's been... years.

08:57.280 --> 08:58.963
Since our first semester at Stanford.

08:58.964 --> 09:00.208
K-Bex?

09:00.209 --> 09:01.818
Um...

09:02.920 --> 09:04.032
I, uh, I...

09:04.033 --> 09:05.135
Do you think we could catch up later?

09:05.136 --> 09:07.127
I'm actually here for work.

09:07.128 --> 09:08.071
Oh, well, that explains

09:08.072 --> 09:10.008
why you aren't wearing
your "Nebula-9" outfit.

09:10.009 --> 09:11.446
You, uh...

09:11.447 --> 09:13.217
You have a "Nebula-9" outfit?

09:13.218 --> 09:14.342
Oh, she had a few.

09:14.343 --> 09:15.832
She was a mega fan.

09:15.833 --> 09:17.984
You should've seen her as Lieutenant Chloe.

09:17.985 --> 09:19.248
Oh, wait. You can.

09:19.249 --> 09:21.108
Remember that photo we all took?

09:21.414 --> 09:23.799
I brought it to get it signed.

09:23.998 --> 09:25.511
It's us from back in the day.

09:25.512 --> 09:27.682
Ooh. Isn't it frakin' awesome?

09:27.683 --> 09:28.780
It's frakin' something.

09:28.781 --> 09:30.816
Henry, I need that photo.

09:30.817 --> 09:32.505
What? Why?

09:32.826 --> 09:36.106
It's official NYPD business.

09:36.367 --> 09:38.024
Don't make me ask again.

09:43.563 --> 09:45.141
Thank you.

09:47.122 --> 09:49.286
So I was "Nebula-9" fan. Big deal.

09:49.287 --> 09:50.588
Oh, you were beyond a fan.

09:50.589 --> 09:53.005
You dressed up in costume.
You.

09:53.402 --> 09:54.365
Okay, yes,

09:54.366 --> 09:56.326
I was a Sci-Fi loving,
costume-wearing geek,

09:56.327 --> 09:57.395
and you know what?

09:57.396 --> 09:59.934
Not ashamed of it or of "Nebula-9."

09:59.935 --> 10:03.085
Despite what you think,
it was an awesome show.

10:03.086 --> 10:04.860
Hmm.
I'll tell you what,

10:04.861 --> 10:06.977
I'll forgive you your terrible taste

10:06.978 --> 10:08.343
if you...

10:08.344 --> 10:11.623
Try on that "Nebula-9" costume for me.

10:11.713 --> 10:13.012
In your dreams.

10:13.013 --> 10:14.130
Look at my life.

10:14.131 --> 10:15.863
My dreams come true.

10:17.985 --> 10:18.987
Perlmutter.

10:18.988 --> 10:20.169
Detective Beckett.

10:20.170 --> 10:21.174
Perlmutter.

10:21.175 --> 10:23.154
And non-detective Castle.

10:23.155 --> 10:24.512
So do you have a cause of death?

10:24.513 --> 10:26.094
It was a burn,

10:26.095 --> 10:29.369
a burn that penetrated
tissue, muscle, and bone,

10:29.370 --> 10:32.562
leaving this perfectly cylindrical hole.

10:32.563 --> 10:33.924
Well, what kind of burn does that?

10:33.925 --> 10:35.412
Well, one created by

10:35.413 --> 10:37.876
high levels of infrared radiation.

10:37.877 --> 10:39.159
The...the blood vessels

10:39.160 --> 10:40.621
were cauterized from the intense heat.

10:40.622 --> 10:41.260
Are you saying...

10:41.261 --> 10:42.999
She was killed by a phaser?

10:43.943 --> 10:46.845
Well, as much as it pains me,

10:46.846 --> 10:48.589
Mr. Castle is...

10:48.590 --> 10:50.017
Marginally correct.

10:50.018 --> 10:50.734
She was killed by

10:50.735 --> 10:52.897
a high-intensity laser beam.

10:53.562 --> 10:55.347
A real Sci-Fi murder...

10:55.348 --> 10:57.466
At a Sci-Fi convention.

10:58.473 --> 11:00.251
Just keeps getting better.

11:12.715 --> 11:15.392
How is it possible that
she's killed by a laser?

11:15.393 --> 11:17.326
Easy.
Someone shot her with a laser gun.

11:17.327 --> 11:19.029
Real ones don't exist, Castle.

11:19.030 --> 11:20.451
Actually, they do.

11:20.452 --> 11:22.944
There is an advanced tactical phaser

11:22.945 --> 11:24.076
that could melt a hole in a tank

11:24.077 --> 11:25.880
from 5 miles away.

11:25.881 --> 11:28.037
Read about it. It's as big as a truck.

11:28.038 --> 11:29.619
Yes, well, obviously
someone has constructed

11:29.620 --> 11:32.098
a portable, hand-held version.

11:32.099 --> 11:33.029
Like who?

11:33.030 --> 11:35.932
Let's go back to the e-mails
of the crazed "Nebula-9" fans.

11:35.933 --> 11:37.137
And when I say "crazed fans,"

11:37.138 --> 11:39.103
I'm...I'm not referring to you.

11:39.104 --> 11:41.374
You... are a mega fan.

11:41.375 --> 11:42.737
Nice one coming from the guy

11:42.738 --> 11:44.836
with a life-size Boba Fett in his bathroom.

11:44.837 --> 11:46.229
Point taken. Anyway...

11:46.230 --> 11:48.262
Perhaps one of these fans,

11:48.263 --> 11:52.075
enraged by Anabelle's
blasphemous webisodes,

11:52.076 --> 11:55.383
somehow fashioned a
functioning Thorian blaster

11:55.384 --> 11:57.627
and, in an act of divine retribution,

11:57.628 --> 11:59.875
said killer shot Anabelle
with the very weapon

11:59.876 --> 12:01.859
featured on "Nebula-9."

12:02.017 --> 12:03.452
Interesting theory,

12:03.453 --> 12:06.847
but we have interviewed
all of those crazed fans,

12:06.848 --> 12:08.563
and they all have alibis.

12:08.564 --> 12:11.551
Okay, well, then maybe
it wasn't a crazed fan.

12:11.885 --> 12:13.080
But...

12:13.225 --> 12:14.821
The fact is,

12:14.822 --> 12:19.088
someone did zap Anabelle
with some kind of...

12:19.089 --> 12:20.213
Laser blaster.

12:20.214 --> 12:22.656
I will talk to ATF and
see if they've heard

12:22.657 --> 12:24.877
of anyone possessing a...

12:25.505 --> 12:26.822
Laser blaster.

12:26.823 --> 12:30.102
A functional laser weapon.

12:30.103 --> 12:32.349
In the meantime, hopefully,
Ryan and Esposito

12:32.350 --> 12:33.500
have found some witnesses

12:33.501 --> 12:35.804
by posting on the fan site.

12:37.772 --> 12:39.328
Her name is Anabelle Collins.

12:39.329 --> 12:40.402
Did you see her in this area

12:40.403 --> 12:42.593
between 10:00 and 11:00 P.M. last night?

12:45.907 --> 12:48.825
Um... let me repeat the question.

12:48.826 --> 12:51.352
First of all, ma'am, I must ask you,

12:51.353 --> 12:55.173
uh, how are you keeping those
leaves on there like that?

12:55.174 --> 12:57.469
Why don't you pull on one and find out?

12:58.609 --> 13:01.459
Did you see her or not?

13:02.030 --> 13:04.682
He only speaks Mersatonian.

13:05.214 --> 13:06.734
Maybe you could translate for me.

13:06.735 --> 13:09.048
I'm not really that fluent.

13:09.100 --> 13:10.265
Next.

13:10.266 --> 13:11.334
Did you see her here last night

13:11.335 --> 13:13.040
between 10:00 and 11:00?

13:13.041 --> 13:14.199
Nope.

13:15.057 --> 13:17.149
But...

13:17.485 --> 13:20.451
If there's anything else
I can do for you...

13:21.163 --> 13:23.017
Here's my number.

13:23.514 --> 13:25.156
Call me.

13:25.690 --> 13:27.526
You took my pen.

13:29.307 --> 13:32.561
Let me begin by asking if
you speak English or not.

13:32.562 --> 13:34.401
Obvi.

13:35.074 --> 13:36.034
Okay.

13:36.035 --> 13:39.314
Did you see this woman between
10:00 and 11:00 P.M. last night?

13:39.315 --> 13:40.817
- Yeah.
- You did?

13:40.818 --> 13:42.857
Yeah. My friends and I
were totes pissed at her

13:42.858 --> 13:45.258
because she told us that the
fan experience was closed,

13:45.259 --> 13:47.548
and then two seconds later, she
brought someone inside here.

13:47.549 --> 13:49.002
Could you describe who she was with?

13:49.003 --> 13:50.535
I can do lots better.

13:50.536 --> 13:52.141
I can tell you her name.

13:52.142 --> 13:53.910
Stephanie Frye...

13:53.911 --> 13:56.372
the actress who played your personal hero

13:56.373 --> 13:56.879
Lieutenant Chloe

13:56.880 --> 13:59.404
in the original "Nebula-9" series?

14:00.205 --> 14:02.280
A witness saw Anabelle and Stephanie

14:02.281 --> 14:05.981
walk on to the spaceship set around 9:45.

14:05.983 --> 14:08.031
Well, did she see either
one of them after that?

14:08.032 --> 14:09.373
No.

14:10.296 --> 14:12.038
Stephanie's a big movie star now.

14:12.039 --> 14:13.715
She's not even involved with "Nebula-9."

14:13.716 --> 14:15.803
What possible motive could she have?

14:15.841 --> 14:17.803
All I know is that she was
one of the last people

14:17.804 --> 14:19.088
to see Anabelle alive,

14:19.089 --> 14:21.184
so I have to talk to her.

14:23.542 --> 14:24.907
I'm sad to hear about Anabelle.

14:24.908 --> 14:27.322
I've met her a few times
at conventions like this.

14:27.323 --> 14:28.633
She seemed lovely.

14:28.634 --> 14:30.115
We have witness that saw you and Anabelle

14:30.116 --> 14:32.622
go into the ship just before she died.

14:33.179 --> 14:34.096
You don't think...

14:34.097 --> 14:36.487
We're just trying to
figure out what happened.

14:36.488 --> 14:38.088
Nothing happened.

14:38.089 --> 14:40.541
We talked. It was a quick conversation.

14:40.542 --> 14:42.845
I had to be on the red carpet 10:00.

14:42.846 --> 14:44.220
What did you talk about?

14:44.221 --> 14:45.592
Ugh. She asked if I'd be part

14:45.593 --> 14:48.571
of this weekend's
"Nebula-9" fan experience.

14:48.572 --> 14:50.795
Yeah, but you'd distanced
yourself from the show.

14:51.844 --> 14:54.321
Didn't you?
I... heard that you did.

14:54.322 --> 14:56.278
Well, don't get me wrong,

14:56.279 --> 14:59.030
playing Lieutenant Chloe was my big break,

14:59.031 --> 15:00.670
but...

15:00.880 --> 15:02.410
"Nebula-9"?

15:02.726 --> 15:04.812
Not exactly a career launcher.

15:05.555 --> 15:06.501
I know.

15:06.513 --> 15:07.760
Now that I'm finally

15:07.761 --> 15:09.917
being taken seriously as an actress,

15:09.918 --> 15:11.711
I couldn't go back.

15:11.712 --> 15:13.207
It would harm my image.

15:13.548 --> 15:16.619
So I told Anabelle no. She understood.

15:16.714 --> 15:17.846
Well, I'm not sure I do.

15:17.847 --> 15:20.676
Why would she even ask if
she knew you'd refuse?

15:20.677 --> 15:21.932
She was desperate.

15:22.521 --> 15:23.785
She said she'd have to shut it down

15:23.786 --> 15:25.758
if she didn't have an original cast member.

15:25.759 --> 15:27.255
Yeah, but what about captain Max?

15:27.829 --> 15:30.772
Gabriel, uh, Winters...
she had him, didn't she?

15:31.354 --> 15:34.137
Gabriel is a complicated guy.

15:34.485 --> 15:36.283
I mean, she didn't go into detail,

15:36.284 --> 15:38.819
but she was having problems with him.

15:39.786 --> 15:41.366
She was having problems with him all right.

15:41.436 --> 15:43.517
Word is that Gabriel was showing up late

15:43.518 --> 15:45.051
to the fan experience,

15:45.052 --> 15:46.349
and drunk.

15:46.832 --> 15:48.615
Captain Max was drunk?

15:48.616 --> 15:50.206
Among other transgressions.

15:50.207 --> 15:52.926
He was actually a no-show to
the "Nebula-9" yesterday,

15:53.023 --> 15:53.876
and Anabelle had to

15:53.877 --> 15:56.490
rouse him from his hotel room,
where he was passed out naked

15:56.491 --> 15:58.637
with two Lieutenant Chloes.

15:59.232 --> 16:01.751
I think fortune was definitely
guiding his journey.

16:01.752 --> 16:04.062
Just because he exhibited some bad behavior

16:04.063 --> 16:06.559
doesn't mean that that
was motive for murder.

16:06.560 --> 16:08.874
Well, except that I just
spoke to Gabriel's agent.

16:08.913 --> 16:11.160
Anabelle called her yesterday,
threatening to fire him.

16:11.161 --> 16:12.411
And so he killed her?

16:12.458 --> 16:13.476
Well, here's the thing, the guy

16:13.477 --> 16:14.838
is a washed up actor.

16:14.839 --> 16:16.715
He's barely worked since
the show was canceled.

16:16.716 --> 16:18.899
He does, what, 20 fan experiences a day

16:18.900 --> 16:20.194
at 500 bucks a shot?

16:20.514 --> 16:21.843
If Anabelle took that away from him,

16:22.277 --> 16:23.267
he'd have nothing.

16:24.160 --> 16:25.749
Okay, guys. Thanks.

16:26.004 --> 16:28.416
Anabelle said she was betrayed
by someone she trusted.

16:28.618 --> 16:30.128
Maybe that was captain Max.

16:30.235 --> 16:31.336
Oh, my God!

16:31.460 --> 16:32.387
Alexis?

16:33.247 --> 16:35.488
Dad?
What are you doing here?

16:35.489 --> 16:38.378
What are you doing here dressed like that?

16:38.554 --> 16:41.209
We're Havacura.
It's a tribe of female assassins who...

16:41.210 --> 16:42.261
Don't wear clothes?

16:42.480 --> 16:44.688
You're overreacting. And
you're embarrassing me.

16:44.689 --> 16:47.463
Oh, I'm embarrassing you?
I'm the one who's dressed.

16:47.464 --> 16:49.294
- Dad!
- Castle, come on. Let's go.

16:47.464 --> 16:49.294
Captain, new contact on long-range sensors.

16:49.394 --> 16:51.630
Are you kidding me? Do you
see what she's wearing?

16:51.631 --> 16:52.575
Yeah, it's not that bad.

16:52.576 --> 16:55.447
Not that bad?
How am I gonna unsee that?

16:57.516 --> 16:59.672
Oracle... chances of crew
survival if we engage?

16:59.897 --> 17:01.884
Our weapons systems are disabled.

17:01.885 --> 17:04.569
The alien vessel has superior firepower.

17:04.569 --> 17:07.895
Chances of survival... .1%.

17:10.590 --> 17:12.075
That's a rosy prediction.

17:14.729 --> 17:15.816
We will live to fight...

17:16.096 --> 17:18.885
Ah, we have visitors...

17:19.367 --> 17:21.493
Wearing 21st century garb.

17:22.373 --> 17:23.358
Do you come in peace...

17:24.196 --> 17:26.553
Or is this more Creaver trickery?

17:26.554 --> 17:27.852
NYPD.

17:27.853 --> 17:30.428
Sorry, folks, we're gonna
have to cut this short.

17:30.434 --> 17:31.530
Everyone out.

17:32.719 --> 17:33.861
This is outrageous.

17:34.625 --> 17:37.450
I included you in the
"Nebula-9" experience,

17:37.608 --> 17:38.766
and you ruined it.

17:38.935 --> 17:40.361
Mr. Winters, where were you last night

17:40.362 --> 17:41.235
between 10:00 and 11:00?

17:41.236 --> 17:43.600
And don't say your hotel room.

17:43.889 --> 17:45.391
You can't be insinuating

17:45.392 --> 17:47.776
I had something to do
with Anabelle's death.

17:49.320 --> 17:51.115
I told you everything I know.

17:51.402 --> 17:53.868
Then you wouldn't mind
relinquishing your weapon.

17:56.569 --> 17:58.347
This Thorian blaster was given to me

17:58.348 --> 18:00.157
by the vice chancellor of Loron

18:00.158 --> 18:00.925
when I helped save the queen...

18:00.926 --> 18:02.591
Oh, for the love of Pete.

18:07.496 --> 18:09.389
Zap, said the lady.

18:12.523 --> 18:14.896
You are so busted.

18:21.860 --> 18:24.928
Hey. So our ballistics
guys got together with...

18:26.612 --> 18:28.289
Perlmutter and tested the blaster.

18:28.290 --> 18:29.551
It's definitely our murder weapon.

18:30.369 --> 18:31.740
I want to build an iron-clad case

18:31.741 --> 18:32.950
against this guy.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.427
Have tech look at the gun,
find out where it came from.

18:35.428 --> 18:36.337
As you wish.

18:38.252 --> 18:39.128
Well...

18:39.238 --> 18:41.295
I can see how Anabelle felt betrayed.

18:41.523 --> 18:43.615
Some guys have no business
commanding a spaceship.

18:43.753 --> 18:44.575
Just goes to show you,

18:44.576 --> 18:46.529
sometimes people aren't
what they appear to be.

18:47.523 --> 18:49.261
For Alexis' sake, I hope you're right,

18:49.262 --> 18:50.553
given what she was wearing.

18:51.462 --> 18:53.437
Castle, she is a full-grown woman.

18:53.438 --> 18:54.454
Who, as we speak,

18:54.647 --> 18:56.927
is being ogled by thousands of sweaty,

18:56.934 --> 18:58.909
lecherous fan boys.

18:58.910 --> 19:00.967
It's just so... wrong.

19:00.968 --> 19:01.994
Can I just point out the fact

19:01.995 --> 19:03.384
that the costume that she was wearing

19:03.385 --> 19:06.234
is not so different from the one
that you are asking me to wear?

19:06.235 --> 19:07.211
Don't say that!

19:07.580 --> 19:08.361
That...

19:09.740 --> 19:12.263
It's confusing and disturbing.

19:12.293 --> 19:14.506
Look, I have no idea where
that blaster came from.

19:14.507 --> 19:16.352
That's funny, since it was on your hip.

19:16.353 --> 19:18.137
I grabbed it off the props
table when I suited up,

19:18.138 --> 19:19.320
just like I always do.

19:19.779 --> 19:20.905
I didn't know it was real.

19:21.485 --> 19:22.431
Wait.

19:22.432 --> 19:23.838
You guys think I killed her

19:23.839 --> 19:25.925
and then kept the murder weapon on me?

19:25.926 --> 19:27.511
What kind of idiot does that?

19:29.035 --> 19:30.825
Why didn't you tell us that
you were having problems

19:30.826 --> 19:31.890
with Anabelle?

19:33.374 --> 19:35.032
I played a lawyer in a well-regarded film

19:35.033 --> 19:36.077
that didn't come out.

19:36.346 --> 19:37.884
I know about the legal system.

19:38.529 --> 19:40.310
That would've just made me look guilty.

19:40.311 --> 19:41.943
As opposed to how you look now?

19:41.944 --> 19:43.747
Look, here's what I think...
Anabelle got tired

19:43.748 --> 19:46.340
of your drunken carousing
and threatened to fire you

19:46.341 --> 19:48.947
from the only job that you
had, so you killed her.

19:48.948 --> 19:50.384
None of that is true.

19:51.336 --> 19:52.652
Except maybe the carousing part.

19:52.653 --> 19:54.065
So she didn't threaten to fire you?

19:54.236 --> 19:55.962
Yes, sure, all the time.

19:55.963 --> 19:57.803
But she'd never go through with it.

19:58.465 --> 20:00.618
I'm the face of "Nebula-9."

20:01.040 --> 20:02.465
I'm the reason all those lunatics

20:02.466 --> 20:04.704
line up for days outside of the convention.

20:04.721 --> 20:06.976
Yes, well, perhaps now they'll
line up outside Sing Sing.

20:07.402 --> 20:09.561
Anabelle and I clashed on certain...

20:10.522 --> 20:11.824
Lifestyle choices.

20:12.130 --> 20:13.410
But we had an understanding.

20:15.849 --> 20:17.197
I even got her and her boyfriend

20:17.198 --> 20:18.950
into the opening night party on Wednesday.

20:18.951 --> 20:21.532
Nice try.
She didn't have a boyfriend.

20:21.533 --> 20:22.599
She told me she did.

20:22.837 --> 20:24.238
Look, the fact is,

20:24.239 --> 20:26.470
you had means, motive, and opportunity.

20:26.471 --> 20:27.785
And we checked with your hotel.

20:27.786 --> 20:30.464
You left at 9:45 P.M.
and returned at 11:00.

20:30.465 --> 20:32.878
That's the exact time window
of Anabelle's murder.

20:32.879 --> 20:35.561
I was busy handling a personal issue

20:35.562 --> 20:37.717
that I would rather not discuss.

20:37.718 --> 20:39.538
You are facing a murder charge.

20:39.539 --> 20:42.100
Okay, look, we already know about

20:42.101 --> 20:44.733
the threesome with the Lieutenant Chloes.

20:45.872 --> 20:47.054
How bad could it be?

20:49.131 --> 20:49.958
Well, let's just say,

20:49.959 --> 20:50.804
my, uh...

20:51.632 --> 20:53.198
Weakness for fleeting romance

20:54.503 --> 20:57.567
left me with a burning desire
to see my doctor last night.

20:57.932 --> 20:59.719
And it just got worse.

21:01.405 --> 21:03.933
So the doctor confirms his alibi.

21:03.934 --> 21:06.898
He was dosing Gabriel with antibiotics

21:06.899 --> 21:08.732
during our time-of-death window.

21:09.223 --> 21:10.883
Gabriel said that Anabelle

21:10.970 --> 21:13.041
went to the party with her boyfriend,

21:13.042 --> 21:15.000
but there's no evidence that
she was in a relationship.

21:15.001 --> 21:16.502
There's nothing in her e-mails,

21:16.503 --> 21:18.233
phone calls, or texts.

21:18.234 --> 21:19.346
And the very next day, she said

21:19.347 --> 21:20.940
someone had betrayed her trust.

21:20.941 --> 21:22.526
Maybe she meant the secret boyfriend.

21:22.531 --> 21:23.945
Whoever he is, he never came forward,

21:23.946 --> 21:25.504
and that is suspicious.

21:25.505 --> 21:26.149
Yo.

21:26.842 --> 21:28.353
Our tech guys caught a break.

21:28.555 --> 21:29.636
They took apart the gun

21:29.670 --> 21:30.599
and they traced the serial number

21:30.600 --> 21:31.745
on one of the components.

21:31.762 --> 21:33.981
The manufacturer shipped it
to an address in the Bronx.

21:34.516 --> 21:36.113
All right, Castle and I
will go check this out.

21:36.114 --> 21:37.674
You guys go to the convention center bar

21:37.675 --> 21:38.771
where the party was being held

21:38.772 --> 21:40.706
and see if you can ID
who Anabelle was with.

21:40.707 --> 21:41.734
- Right on.
- All right.

21:44.327 --> 21:46.115
Better with you, man. I'm telling you.

21:50.489 --> 21:51.915
This is like the Halloween from hell.

21:51.916 --> 21:54.562
Oh, yeah, this is probably
too lowbrow for you, huh?

21:55.019 --> 21:55.676
You're probably into that

21:55.677 --> 21:58.403
boring-ass intellectual kind of Sci-Fi,

21:58.404 --> 22:01.480
like "Gattaca" or "2001."

22:01.922 --> 22:03.451
The monolith... what the hell was that?

22:03.452 --> 22:04.381
Don't ask me.

22:04.891 --> 22:07.281
No, no, swords and sorcery,
that's more my thing,

22:07.282 --> 22:09.209
like, uh, "Lord of the Rings."

22:09.487 --> 22:11.789
Yeah, I could probably see you as an elf

22:12.406 --> 22:13.389
or a hobbit.

22:17.699 --> 22:20.733
Yeah. Served her and her
date in a private room.

22:21.142 --> 22:22.598
Looked pretty cozy, but then, uh,

22:22.599 --> 22:24.940
later she was alone at the
bar, crying her eyes out.

22:24.941 --> 22:26.817
This date of hers, can you describe him?

22:26.818 --> 22:27.644
Sure can.

22:28.097 --> 22:29.089
Looked like that.

22:30.065 --> 22:30.951
A Creaver?

22:31.161 --> 22:32.082
A who?

22:32.517 --> 22:34.615
The evil alien race from "Nebula-9."

22:34.799 --> 22:35.568
Nasty creatures.

22:35.569 --> 22:37.241
They'll eat you face off
while you're still alive

22:37.242 --> 22:39.517
and then serve your organs to their young.

22:40.002 --> 22:41.371
- Good to know.
- Is that all?

22:43.647 --> 22:45.412
Had one of these purple VIP badges.

22:45.610 --> 22:46.613
Pretty exclusive.

22:46.692 --> 22:48.339
Can't be more than a few hundred of them.

22:49.673 --> 22:51.561
"Danger. Do not enter."

22:51.643 --> 22:53.930
Well, that is just the sort
of sign you'd expect to see

22:54.201 --> 22:57.120
on the lair of an evil
laser-gun-making genius.

23:02.970 --> 23:04.503
It's pitch-black inside,

23:04.841 --> 23:06.675
but the door is partially open.

23:06.676 --> 23:08.361
I would say that's an invitation.
Wouldn't you?

23:09.483 --> 23:10.748
Just in case it isn't.

23:16.450 --> 23:18.137
NYPD. Anyone here?

23:23.874 --> 23:26.112
Perhaps we should have
heeded that very wise sign.

23:36.660 --> 23:37.786
Raise your hands!

23:38.832 --> 23:40.363
Prepare to die!

23:58.925 --> 23:59.775
NYPD.

23:59.776 --> 24:01.342
Put down your weapons.

24:07.439 --> 24:08.610
Did you see that?

24:09.257 --> 24:11.307
It worked perfectly.

24:11.338 --> 24:13.295
It's modeled on the targeting system

24:13.318 --> 24:15.768
of a Machbarian star destroyer.

24:16.383 --> 24:18.136
So I take it we're not gonna die.

24:18.442 --> 24:21.422
From remote-controlled laser pointers?
No.

24:21.423 --> 24:24.044
But it's perfect to scare away intruders.

24:24.609 --> 24:26.342
You shoulda seen the UPS guy.

24:26.343 --> 24:27.506
He almost wet himself.

24:27.507 --> 24:28.582
Excuse me. Mister...

24:28.583 --> 24:30.271
Donnelly. Benjamin Donnelly.

24:30.272 --> 24:32.370
Purveyor of Sci-Fi hardware

24:32.554 --> 24:35.016
for the discriminating enthusiast.

24:35.021 --> 24:38.135
So what can I interest you in?

24:38.282 --> 24:40.038
A Klingon batliff, perhaps?

24:40.039 --> 24:41.654
A Cylon laser pistol?

24:41.655 --> 24:43.780
A double-bladed lightsaber?

24:43.781 --> 24:44.938
You have a double-bladed lightsaber?

24:44.939 --> 24:48.212
Actually, we're looking
for a Thorian blaster.

24:49.704 --> 24:50.530
Oh.

24:51.669 --> 24:53.663
The woman has taste.

24:57.236 --> 24:59.885
Plasma pistol with a tri-skellium core...

25:00.355 --> 25:03.030
accurate down to the last detail.

25:03.031 --> 25:04.808
Including its ability to kill?

25:04.920 --> 25:05.645
Excuse me?

25:05.646 --> 25:06.788
We're investigating a murder,

25:06.789 --> 25:08.504
and we traced the weapon back to you.

25:08.935 --> 25:11.697
I created this for entertainment use only.

25:11.698 --> 25:14.477
I never intended for it to hurt anybody.

25:14.696 --> 25:17.496
Thorian blasters don't kill. People do.

25:18.010 --> 25:20.661
I can't be responsible
once they leave my shop.

25:20.662 --> 25:23.751
Yes, well, that is an amazing
piece of weaponry...

25:24.439 --> 25:26.826
That I never want to fire again.

25:26.917 --> 25:28.683
- Wait. You fired it?
- Oh, yeah.

25:29.455 --> 25:31.307
Were you wearing proper protection?

25:31.308 --> 25:32.084
What?

25:33.033 --> 25:35.555
N-no.
Why? Wh-what... what kind of protection?

25:36.823 --> 25:37.834
You'll be fine.

25:38.744 --> 25:39.979
How many of those have you sold?

25:40.013 --> 25:41.989
I only made two that were fully functional.

25:42.152 --> 25:43.723
One in the case here.

25:43.724 --> 25:45.830
The other, I sold to a
collector Wednesday night.

25:45.831 --> 25:46.702
Do you have a name?

25:46.703 --> 25:49.650
Sam? Seth? Simon? Something essey..

25:49.820 --> 25:51.187
You think you could describe him?

25:51.188 --> 25:52.584
No. He was in costume.

25:52.648 --> 25:54.593
Let me guess. Creaver?

25:54.803 --> 25:55.621
Yeah.

25:55.975 --> 25:58.216
He drove away in a white SUV
if that helps.

25:58.217 --> 25:59.281
I didn't get the numbers,

25:59.282 --> 26:01.080
but they were North Carolina plates.

26:01.525 --> 26:03.190
"First in flight."

26:03.796 --> 26:05.106
What kind of protection?

26:08.481 --> 26:10.439
So Ryan and Esposito are
running down everyone

26:10.440 --> 26:12.416
that was issued a purple pass

26:12.417 --> 26:14.287
to see if they can ID our Creaver.

26:14.482 --> 26:16.220
We should have something
by tomorrow morning.

26:16.551 --> 26:18.717
I mean, it's just like you said, Castle.

26:18.718 --> 26:22.353
That costume allowed our
killer to strike unseen.

26:23.235 --> 26:24.968
And of course he's gonna be a Creaver.

26:24.969 --> 26:26.200
I mean, they're the sworn enemies

26:26.201 --> 26:27.758
of the "Nebula-9" crew.

26:28.796 --> 26:29.586
Castle?

26:31.550 --> 26:32.633
Do I look different to you?

26:32.977 --> 26:34.395
No. Why?

26:34.518 --> 26:36.046
Just, I feel so tingly.

26:36.437 --> 26:37.500
Something's wrong.

26:38.354 --> 26:40.496
I'm beginning to mutate
like The Hulk or The Thing

26:40.497 --> 26:42.709
or worse, The Leader. What
would happen to my hair?

26:42.749 --> 26:44.230
I prefer Dr. Manhattan.

26:45.821 --> 26:48.047
The blue skin... brings out your blue eyes.

26:48.748 --> 26:49.860
This isn't funny.

26:50.370 --> 26:52.372
What if firing that blaster
made me infertile?

26:52.904 --> 26:53.876
You want more kids?

26:53.877 --> 26:55.014
Well, I'd like the option.

26:55.021 --> 26:56.685
Well, I think you're gonna be fine, Castle.

26:57.065 --> 26:58.806
All the same, I should decontaminate.

26:59.638 --> 27:00.726
Take a silkwood shower.

27:08.945 --> 27:09.780
Alexis.

27:10.470 --> 27:11.678
What are you doing here?

27:11.926 --> 27:13.296
I thought maybe, after what happened,

27:13.297 --> 27:14.599
that you'd want to talk about it.

27:15.388 --> 27:17.276
No. Me?
No. You?

27:17.277 --> 27:18.145
No.

27:33.401 --> 27:34.048
Yo.

27:36.868 --> 27:38.196
Hey, so we found out that valet parking

27:38.197 --> 27:39.485
comes with those purple passes.

27:39.791 --> 27:41.136
And there was only one attendee

27:41.137 --> 27:43.393
that had a white SUV
with North Carolina plates.

27:43.625 --> 27:44.754
Simon Westport.

27:44.889 --> 27:46.173
He was on 295 heading South

27:46.174 --> 27:47.654
when state troopers pulled him over.

27:47.659 --> 27:49.433
He had a Creaver outfit in his trunk.

27:50.205 --> 27:51.923
Do you recognize this, Simon?

27:53.018 --> 27:54.202
It's a Thorian blaster.

27:54.271 --> 27:55.410
You know what else it is?

27:55.907 --> 27:58.245
It's the gun that killed Anabelle Collins.

27:58.249 --> 27:59.941
Bought by a guy dressed as a Creaver

27:59.942 --> 28:01.695
who was seen with the
victim before she died.

28:01.696 --> 28:02.914
This is not what it looks like.

28:02.915 --> 28:04.585
I bought that for her as a gift.

28:04.618 --> 28:06.588
You bought her a live-fire
collectible laser gun

28:06.589 --> 28:08.740
- as a gift?
- I did not kill her.

28:08.741 --> 28:10.860
I didn't even know she was
dead till the police told me.

28:11.200 --> 28:13.106
What was your relationship to the victim?

28:15.613 --> 28:18.612
I met Anabelle at SupernovaCon,
like, five years ago,

28:18.619 --> 28:19.502
and we just clicked.

28:23.295 --> 28:24.030
Look,

28:24.149 --> 28:26.372
at the con, you can be anyone
you want to be for a few days.

28:26.373 --> 28:28.228
So we'd hook up.

28:29.213 --> 28:30.998
It was a "same time next
year" kind of thing.

28:31.035 --> 28:31.807
So how does that square

28:31.808 --> 28:33.548
with you leaving her at the bar crying?

28:33.774 --> 28:35.713
Okay, something did happen
at the party that night,

28:35.714 --> 28:36.801
but not with me.

28:36.941 --> 28:39.346
I gave her the blaster. She was thrilled.

28:39.420 --> 28:40.687
I left to take a phone call.

28:40.688 --> 28:42.681
I come back, and there's
a guy hassling her.

28:42.682 --> 28:43.533
About what?

28:43.534 --> 28:44.913
I don't know, but he tried to kiss her.

28:45.111 --> 28:46.291
She slapped him in the face.

28:46.647 --> 28:48.594
By the time I got to her,
he had already taken off.

28:48.595 --> 28:51.479
But she's all upset about it.
She tells me she needs space.

28:51.480 --> 28:53.102
So she takes the blaster and leaves.

28:53.714 --> 28:55.672
So I track her down the next
day to see if she's okay,

28:55.673 --> 28:57.587
and out of nowhere she says that
she's done with SupernovaCon

28:57.588 --> 28:58.781
and she's done with me.

28:59.790 --> 29:01.438
So I checked out of my hotel and I left.

29:01.571 --> 29:02.813
Can you describe this guy?

29:02.996 --> 29:03.922
Yeah.

29:04.131 --> 29:05.876
He's the guy she did those webisodes with...

29:06.331 --> 29:07.337
Davis.

29:09.193 --> 29:11.718
So sounds like whatever happened
between Davis and Anabelle

29:11.719 --> 29:12.764
really did a number on her.

29:12.765 --> 29:15.180
All of a sudden, she was ready to
ditch Simon and the convention.

29:15.181 --> 29:16.109
We talked to Davis.

29:16.110 --> 29:17.703
He never mentioned any incident.

29:17.733 --> 29:18.906
Which means he's hiding something.

29:18.907 --> 29:20.091
Either that or he killed her.

29:20.708 --> 29:24.347
Hey. Tell me, you guys, do you
think my hair is thinning?

29:24.880 --> 29:26.476
You're not losing your hair, Castle.

29:26.477 --> 29:27.746
Okay, so if I wake up bald tomorrow,

29:27.747 --> 29:29.178
you'll still be attracted to me?

29:29.863 --> 29:31.125
Oh, my God. You wouldn't.

29:31.126 --> 29:31.947
I didn't say that.

29:31.948 --> 29:33.219
No, but you were thinking it.

29:33.220 --> 29:34.284
I can see it in your...

29:35.684 --> 29:37.802
With that pumpkin head?
Dude.

29:47.538 --> 29:48.819
Davis, what was your relationship

29:48.820 --> 29:50.127
with Anabelle Collins?

29:51.033 --> 29:53.014
I told you before. We were friends.

29:53.106 --> 29:55.777
Was friendship enough or did you want more?

29:56.929 --> 29:58.309
Witnesses saw you with Anabelle

29:58.310 --> 29:59.309
at the opening night party.

29:59.310 --> 30:00.931
It sounds like she didn't respond too well

30:00.932 --> 30:02.938
- to your advances.
- And why would she?

30:02.939 --> 30:04.893
I mean, you were already in a relationship

30:04.894 --> 30:06.158
with her best friend.

30:06.159 --> 30:08.192
Why would you risk it all
by making a pass at her?

30:08.193 --> 30:10.837
Only one reason. Love.

30:10.838 --> 30:12.815
But you were with Audrey.

30:12.816 --> 30:15.104
I was. I am.

30:16.401 --> 30:18.146
But it was always Anabelle.

30:18.147 --> 30:20.203
Why don't you tell us what happened?

30:21.396 --> 30:22.091
That night

30:22.092 --> 30:23.537
I'd had a few drinks,

30:23.538 --> 30:26.722
and I saw her with that...
Creaver at the party.

30:26.723 --> 30:28.450
And they were all over each other.

30:28.669 --> 30:30.105
And it killed me.

30:30.270 --> 30:31.209
I couldn't take it anymore.

30:31.210 --> 30:32.566
I had to tell her how I really felt,

30:32.567 --> 30:33.875
and she...

30:35.068 --> 30:36.956
She said terrible things.

30:36.957 --> 30:38.348
She said that I had ruined everything,

30:38.349 --> 30:39.751
that she was gonna have to tell Audrey.

30:39.752 --> 30:43.045
And... I didn't know what else to do.

30:43.215 --> 30:44.836
Davis, did you kill Anabelle?

30:44.998 --> 30:46.132
No.

30:46.133 --> 30:47.754
No, I was halfway across the building

30:47.755 --> 30:49.208
when it happened at the masquerade ball.

30:49.209 --> 30:50.509
You can check.

30:51.453 --> 30:52.705
Look...

30:52.706 --> 30:55.245
I tried to make things right with her.

30:55.867 --> 30:58.118
I told her I was drunk, and we
should just forget about it,

30:58.119 --> 30:59.974
but she couldn't.

31:01.150 --> 31:02.971
She said it was one thing
to live a fantasy,

31:02.972 --> 31:05.354
but she wasn't gonna live a lie...

31:05.877 --> 31:08.255
And that this was gonna be our last con.

31:08.537 --> 31:10.562
She was gonna end the fan experience?

31:10.563 --> 31:13.109
Not just the fan experience. Everything.

31:13.288 --> 31:14.885
She said it was time to move on.

31:15.429 --> 31:16.778
She had decided to cash out

31:16.779 --> 31:18.707
and sell the rights to "Nebula-9."

31:18.708 --> 31:20.531
I mean, they were worthless
when she first got 'em,

31:20.532 --> 31:21.818
but she...

31:21.997 --> 31:24.338
She made the show popular again.

31:24.490 --> 31:26.004
They were talking about
rebooting the series,

31:26.005 --> 31:27.164
maybe even doing a movie.

31:27.165 --> 31:29.342
That would mean some real money.

31:29.343 --> 31:32.219
Davis, who gets the rights
now that Anabelle's dead?

31:32.477 --> 31:34.090
They go to Audrey.

31:36.041 --> 31:37.438
Why?

31:37.960 --> 31:40.122
So Davis' alibi checks out.

31:40.123 --> 31:41.586
- Sort of.
- Sort of?

31:41.587 --> 31:44.451
Yeah, organizers confirm that he
arrived at the party at 9:30,

31:44.452 --> 31:45.991
but everyone was masked.

31:45.992 --> 31:48.385
So he could have slipped out at anytime.

31:48.386 --> 31:51.304
Hey. So Anabelle was
serious about cashing out.

31:51.305 --> 31:54.124
She had an offer on the table
from Epicscope Productions.

31:54.125 --> 31:55.620
She'd been refusing to sell for months,

31:55.621 --> 31:57.039
but the day she died, she put in a call

31:57.040 --> 31:59.015
- saying she was ready to make that deal.
- For how much?

31:59.016 --> 32:00.562
$2 and a half million.

32:01.078 --> 32:01.813
That's motive.

32:01.814 --> 32:03.145
That's madness.

32:03.146 --> 32:05.632
$2.5 mil for that God-awful show?

32:05.633 --> 32:08.558
But now that she's dead, they're
gonna have to pay Audrey.

32:08.559 --> 32:10.253
And she didn't even wait
for the body to get cold.

32:10.254 --> 32:11.893
The morning after Anabelle was killed,

32:11.894 --> 32:13.651
Audrey put in a call to Epicscope.

32:13.652 --> 32:15.380
They closed the deal today.

32:16.747 --> 32:19.755
Yeah, I sold the rights. I mean, so what?

32:19.756 --> 32:21.652
All this... this is all Anabelle.

32:21.653 --> 32:23.257
What's the point in doing it without her?

32:23.258 --> 32:25.074
Except you weren't going
to be doing it with her

32:25.075 --> 32:26.454
much longer, were you?

32:27.343 --> 32:28.443
I don't know what you mean.

32:28.444 --> 32:30.327
You worked for years helping Anabelle

32:30.328 --> 32:32.313
bring "Nebula-9" back to life.

32:32.314 --> 32:33.989
If she sold the rights,
all this would go away,

32:33.990 --> 32:35.441
leaving you with nothing.

32:35.755 --> 32:38.485
And you couldn't let her
do that, could you?

32:39.285 --> 32:41.646
That is a disgusting thing to say.

32:41.647 --> 32:43.076
She was my best friend.

32:43.077 --> 32:45.206
Where were you the night
that she was killed?

32:49.469 --> 32:52.247
I'm not gonna answer any
more of your questions.

32:56.414 --> 32:57.420
Let's make sure

32:57.421 --> 32:59.400
that history never forgets

32:59.401 --> 33:02.374
the name "Enterprise."

33:03.126 --> 33:05.353
Yeah, okay.
Thanks, Ryan.

33:05.650 --> 33:09.233
So Audrey's hotel key card
was used at 9:48 P.M.

33:09.234 --> 33:11.914
And then it wasn't used again
the rest of the night.

33:11.915 --> 33:13.395
Well, she could've slipped out,

33:13.396 --> 33:14.419
left her door ajar.

33:14.420 --> 33:16.151
That would have given her
enough time to get down here.

33:16.152 --> 33:16.798
Yeah, but, Castle,

33:16.799 --> 33:18.385
all we have is circumstantial evidence

33:18.386 --> 33:20.273
and soft alibis.

33:20.274 --> 33:22.340
We've gotta get something more concrete.

33:24.025 --> 33:25.772
I can't tell you how many times

33:25.773 --> 33:29.403
I have had dreams about
being in this very ship.

33:30.850 --> 33:32.398
Sexy dreams?

33:32.969 --> 33:33.918
You know, it's never too late

33:33.919 --> 33:35.564
to live out your fantasy.

33:37.020 --> 33:39.319
You do realize that this
is still a crime scene?

33:39.320 --> 33:40.648
Oh, right.
Ew.

33:40.649 --> 33:41.594
Yeah.

33:48.738 --> 33:49.807
You're right, okay?

33:49.808 --> 33:52.010
It was a stupid show.

33:52.048 --> 33:55.658
It was cheesy and melodramatic.

33:56.922 --> 33:59.028
I mean, a handful of academy cadets

33:59.029 --> 34:00.261
on a training mission,

34:00.262 --> 34:01.639
and suddenly, the earth is destroyed

34:01.640 --> 34:03.026
and they're all that's left of humanity?

34:03.027 --> 34:04.705
I completely understand why you hated it.

34:05.361 --> 34:09.335
But, Castle, I also understand
why people loved it,

34:09.335 --> 34:11.608
why Anabelle loved it.

34:11.609 --> 34:14.266
It was about leaving
home for the first time,

34:14.268 --> 34:16.138
about searching for your identity

34:16.139 --> 34:17.822
and making a difference.

34:18.438 --> 34:21.543
I loved dressing up like Lieutenant Chloe.

34:21.824 --> 34:23.931
She didn't care what
anybody thought about her,

34:23.933 --> 34:26.081
and I kinda did at that time.

34:26.969 --> 34:29.588
I mean, she was a scientist and a warrior,

34:29.589 --> 34:32.121
and that was all in spite
of the way that she looked.

34:33.417 --> 34:33.762
It was like

34:33.763 --> 34:35.505
I could be anything,

34:35.507 --> 34:37.873
and I didn't have to choose.

34:40.933 --> 34:43.342
So don't make fun, okay?

34:43.342 --> 34:44.844
Okay.

34:44.844 --> 34:45.731
Besides, it didn't hurt

34:45.732 --> 34:48.234
that my legs looked great in her outfit.

34:48.235 --> 34:49.967
Oh, of that I have no dou...

34:49.967 --> 34:51.197
Oh!

34:51.344 --> 34:52.311
What's wrong?

34:52.312 --> 34:53.783
My hand.

34:58.217 --> 34:59.790
I mean, what does that mean?

34:59.791 --> 35:02.489
That means you just solved our case.

35:12.810 --> 35:14.999
Thank you, everyone, for coming in today.

35:15.791 --> 35:17.539
I was under the impression
I didn't have a choice.

35:17.540 --> 35:19.033
You didn't.

35:20.193 --> 35:21.574
I don't understand.
What are we doing here?

35:21.575 --> 35:25.427
Everyone in this room had a
relationship with the victim.

35:25.428 --> 35:29.878
Each of you had either motive
or opportunity to kill her.

35:29.879 --> 35:32.341
Uh, Ms. Frye, would you do me the honor

35:32.342 --> 35:33.941
of a little improvisation?

35:33.942 --> 35:36.632
Trust me, that woman needs a script.

35:36.633 --> 35:38.437
I'm happy to help.

35:38.438 --> 35:40.902
Ms. Frye will be playing Anabelle Collins.

35:40.903 --> 35:43.059
I will be the killer.

35:43.060 --> 35:44.799
Anabelle had the murder weapon on her

35:44.800 --> 35:45.717
the night she died.

35:45.718 --> 35:47.607
Don't worry. This one's just a toy.

35:47.608 --> 35:49.935
Now the killer confronts Anabelle.

35:49.936 --> 35:53.629
Anabelle, presumably to protect
herself, drew her blaster.

35:53.630 --> 35:55.029
They struggled for the gun.

35:55.030 --> 35:57.053
The killer overpow...

35:57.904 --> 36:00.186
- I-I need you to resist just a little less.
- Oh.

36:00.187 --> 36:01.683
Told ya.

36:01.684 --> 36:02.830
And...

36:03.704 --> 36:05.562
Wrenched free the weapon.

36:05.563 --> 36:08.934
Anabelle was slain by her
own Thorian blaster.

36:08.935 --> 36:09.809
Zap.

36:10.560 --> 36:11.547
Ohh!

36:12.337 --> 36:13.814
Ohh.

36:15.165 --> 36:16.340
Overacting much?

36:16.341 --> 36:17.712
Shut up, Gabriel.

36:17.713 --> 36:19.197
At that point,

36:19.198 --> 36:20.852
the killer stashed Anabelle's body

36:20.853 --> 36:22.062
in the oracle pod,

36:22.063 --> 36:25.088
not knowing that by firing
the Thorian blaster,

36:25.089 --> 36:26.686
they were leaving behind crucial evidence.

36:26.687 --> 36:28.484
The energy emission from the gun

36:28.485 --> 36:31.548
left a superficial burn
on the killer's skin...

36:31.549 --> 36:33.603
Which is visible under UV light.

36:33.604 --> 36:36.769
Branding our murderer
with the mark of Cain.

36:36.770 --> 36:39.314
Or for you "Nebula-9" fans,

36:39.315 --> 36:41.562
the mark of Claderesh.

36:41.563 --> 36:43.573
Simon, could you step forward, please?

36:46.223 --> 36:48.197
Could you hold out your hands?

36:50.604 --> 36:51.657
Thank you.

36:52.793 --> 36:54.629
Davis.

37:00.919 --> 37:02.874
Your left hand as well.

37:06.851 --> 37:08.176
Thank you.

37:09.271 --> 37:11.214
Audrey.

37:22.440 --> 37:24.419
Mr. Winters?

37:37.459 --> 37:38.857
Look, I, um...

37:39.625 --> 37:40.814
I can explain.

37:40.815 --> 37:41.857
It was you?

37:41.858 --> 37:43.969
No. I have an alibi.

37:43.970 --> 37:45.497
Alibis can be bought.

37:45.498 --> 37:47.635
I didn't kill Anabelle.

37:47.636 --> 37:50.083
Then why is your hand glowing?

37:50.269 --> 37:51.745
Because...

37:52.356 --> 37:55.060
When I found out some nerd was
making real Thorian blasters,

37:55.061 --> 37:57.500
I figured if anybody should
have one, it should be me.

37:58.364 --> 38:00.656
I'm captain Max.

38:01.153 --> 38:03.754
So I tracked him down and
I bought the last one.

38:03.755 --> 38:06.113
This is from this morning.

38:06.114 --> 38:08.148
I shot it in my hotel room.

38:08.187 --> 38:09.915
There's a hole in the wall.

38:10.289 --> 38:11.876
You can check.

38:15.765 --> 38:17.409
Stephanie, where are you going?

38:17.410 --> 38:18.764
I was just gonna...

38:18.765 --> 38:20.637
Hold it right there!

38:25.711 --> 38:27.044
You heard the man.

38:27.045 --> 38:28.450
This one's deadly.

38:28.451 --> 38:29.424
Nobody moves

38:29.425 --> 38:32.672
or I put a hole in his head.

38:33.097 --> 38:34.948
Am I the only one that finds this situation

38:34.949 --> 38:36.346
eerily familiar?

38:36.347 --> 38:37.960
Stephanie, why?

38:37.961 --> 38:39.614
Do you know how long I have worked

38:39.615 --> 38:42.754
to get away from Lieutenant Chloe,

38:42.933 --> 38:45.716
to get away from the stench of this show?

38:45.717 --> 38:48.501
The fan experience was bad enough,

38:48.712 --> 38:50.147
but she was gonna sell the rights,

38:50.148 --> 38:52.570
and it was gonna start all over again...

38:52.571 --> 38:54.747
the movies, the product lines,

38:54.748 --> 38:57.250
Lieutenant Chloe bobbleheads!

38:58.058 --> 39:02.966
Do you know how hard I worked
to make something of myself,

39:03.136 --> 39:05.890
to become a real actress?

39:07.598 --> 39:08.740
Oh, come on, Steph.

39:08.741 --> 39:11.348
You can't act your way out of paper bag.

39:12.412 --> 39:14.278
The only solace I have

39:14.279 --> 39:16.355
is, this time when I kill you,

39:16.356 --> 39:18.776
there is not an Andorian empath

39:18.777 --> 39:21.830
to bring you back from the dead.

39:22.551 --> 39:24.027
I don't think so.

39:29.655 --> 39:32.193
I've been waiting ten
years to do that, bitch.

39:32.849 --> 39:35.458
Nobody takes over my ship.

39:37.394 --> 39:38.216
Oh.

39:38.403 --> 39:39.856
It's a lot easier when
the stunt guys do it.

39:39.857 --> 39:41.399
Do you realize how lucky you are?

39:41.400 --> 39:43.683
You could've gotten yourself killed.

39:44.101 --> 39:45.571
Not even.

39:45.901 --> 39:47.611
I had it on stun.

39:50.881 --> 39:51.623
Stephanie Frye,

39:51.624 --> 39:54.396
you're under arrest for the
murder of Anabelle Collins.

39:54.557 --> 39:55.821
Oh, oh, oh, oh,

39:56.531 --> 39:57.952
may I?

40:00.924 --> 40:03.643
And may fortune guide your journey.

40:10.246 --> 40:11.818
The doctor says my hand's
gonna stop glowing

40:11.819 --> 40:12.915
in a few days.

40:12.916 --> 40:14.488
So no mutant powers?

40:15.456 --> 40:17.212
No, not this time,

40:17.542 --> 40:19.340
but at least my hair's not falling out.

40:21.129 --> 40:23.522
What about you?
How are...how are you doing?

40:23.523 --> 40:25.443
I'm fine.
Why?

40:25.444 --> 40:27.702
Well, it's hard to see your idols fall.

40:27.703 --> 40:29.954
Oh, Castle. Stephanie
Frye was never my idol.

40:29.955 --> 40:31.501
Lieutenant Chloe was.

40:31.502 --> 40:33.394
And as far as I'm concerned,
she's still out there

40:33.395 --> 40:35.837
fighting evil and saving humanity.

40:36.240 --> 40:39.128
And no self-centered actor is
ever gonna take that from me.

40:39.957 --> 40:41.314
And you know what?

40:41.315 --> 40:42.916
If they do make a movie,

40:42.917 --> 40:45.172
I'm gonna be first in line to see it.

40:45.173 --> 40:47.466
Ah, such is the power of fantasy.

40:47.467 --> 40:49.238
And... speaking of fantasies,

40:49.239 --> 40:51.317
how about we live out one of yours?

40:51.318 --> 40:54.447
What do you say to a
little "Nebula-9" cosplay?

40:54.786 --> 40:56.160
Come on. It'll be fun.

40:56.648 --> 40:58.270
I'll serve you breakfast in bed for a week.

40:58.271 --> 40:59.111
Pfft.

40:59.411 --> 41:01.021
And I'll do your laundry.

41:01.022 --> 41:02.129
Okay, fine.

41:02.130 --> 41:04.619
Do you really want to see me
in one of my old costumes?

41:04.620 --> 41:05.894
Yes, please.

41:07.092 --> 41:07.994
Then you have to promise

41:07.995 --> 41:10.672
that you're gonna watch a
"Nebula-9" marathon with me.

41:10.673 --> 41:11.841
I...

41:15.776 --> 41:16.920
And...

41:16.921 --> 41:18.238
No making fun.

41:21.165 --> 41:22.897
You drive a hard bargain,

41:23.204 --> 41:24.642
but okay.

41:26.702 --> 41:28.594
I'll see you at your place.

41:40.051 --> 41:41.935
Okay, promise not to laugh.

41:41.936 --> 41:44.425
I promise.
Come on. Quit stalling.

41:44.426 --> 41:45.833
Come out already.

41:45.834 --> 41:47.275
Ready?

41:48.123 --> 41:49.488
Ready.

42:07.259 --> 42:08.059
Oh!

42:09.266 --> 42:10.789
Do you like it?
Huh?

42:10.790 --> 42:12.684
That's not what you... that's not...

42:12.685 --> 42:15.149
You want to make out, Castle?
Rawr.

42:15.150 --> 42:16.369
No. I...

42:19.353 --> 42:21.329
Isn't this what your dreams are made of?

42:21.330 --> 42:22.540
Rawr!

42:24.595 --> 42:25.823
Castle.

42:26.517 --> 42:27.858
Are we gonna make out?

42:27.859 --> 42:29.739
Maybe we should start

42:29.740 --> 42:31.628
with the "Nebula-9" marathon.
