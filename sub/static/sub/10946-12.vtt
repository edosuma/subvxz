WEBVTT

00:00.300 --> 00:01.900
Ty: Previously on "Heartland"...

00:01.935 --> 00:05.604
Lou: If Peter could get a job in Calgary,
our biggest problem would be solved.

00:05.638 --> 00:07.939
And Tanner Gunn is the perfect
guy to make that happen.

00:07.974 --> 00:09.675
So when is this meeting supposed to be?

00:09.709 --> 00:13.078
- Amy: Tomorrow.
- Lou: Oh, Amy!

00:13.112 --> 00:15.413
- Lou: And?
- No formal offer or anything though.

00:15.448 --> 00:18.149
Just more of a let's-keep-
in-touch kind of thing.

00:18.184 --> 00:20.017
Amy: Tanner told me that
he made Peter a great offer

00:20.052 --> 00:22.120
and that Peter just said no.

00:22.154 --> 00:24.322
If what you're saying is true,
then Peter didn't just avoid

00:24.356 --> 00:26.624
telling me about the offer and the meeting,

00:26.658 --> 00:29.026
he totally lied to me.

00:29.061 --> 00:33.531
Our entire marriage is based on nothing
but dishonesty and deceit. (Crying)

00:36.802 --> 00:39.043
(Van rumbles)

00:43.909 --> 00:47.078
(Truck rumbles)

00:47.112 --> 00:49.747
Ty: Sorry about taking
time off last minute, Cass.

00:49.781 --> 00:52.316
Cass: Have fun on your trip and
stop worrying about the clinic.

00:52.350 --> 00:54.951
I'm perfectly capable of
running things without you.

00:54.986 --> 00:56.720
Ty: Hey, uh, don't forget about Georgie.

00:56.754 --> 00:59.789
She's coming into the
clinic to volunteer today.

00:59.824 --> 01:03.360
Cass: Right. So, on top of doing your work,
I'm babysitting too.

01:03.394 --> 01:06.363
- Ty: I owe you one, Cass.
- Cass: Yeah, you do.

01:06.397 --> 01:09.366
Which is why you're taking all
of my night shifts next week.

01:09.386 --> 01:10.421
Ty: Wait, what?

01:10.441 --> 01:13.184
Cass: I said you're
taking all of my night shifts next week.

01:13.204 --> 01:15.605
Ty: Uh, uh, Cass... you're breaking up.
I can barely hear you.

01:15.640 --> 01:18.007
- Cass: Ty?
- Ty: Sorry, w-what?

01:18.042 --> 01:20.243
Cass: Ty! (Line goes dead)

01:22.347 --> 01:24.448
(Laughing)

01:24.482 --> 01:26.282
Peter: Okay, more for me then, missy.

01:26.317 --> 01:28.484
Katie: Can I have some?

01:28.518 --> 01:31.221
Peter: Mmm... now you want some?
I thought you didn't like it?

01:31.255 --> 01:33.756
Katie: But I do!

01:33.790 --> 01:35.458
Peter: You hear that, Lou?
She likes kiwi now.

01:35.492 --> 01:37.093
(Chopping)

01:37.127 --> 01:39.395
Lou? We need more kiwi.

01:39.429 --> 01:42.164
Hmm?

01:42.198 --> 01:45.568
Peter: Here, honey.

01:45.602 --> 01:47.302
Hey, what's up? Everything okay?

01:47.337 --> 01:50.740
Lou: Yeah, I'm...
feeling tired today, that's all.

01:50.774 --> 01:52.575
Oh, Amy,
the "save the dates" for the wedding

01:52.609 --> 01:54.142
need to go out this week.

01:54.177 --> 01:56.245
Amy: (Sighs) This week. Got it.

01:56.279 --> 01:58.613
Lou: And have you and Ty finished
finalizing the guest list yet?

01:58.633 --> 01:59.284
Amy: Mmm... (Sighs)

01:59.304 --> 02:00.648
Lou: No. Okay, Amy, it's really important.

02:00.683 --> 02:03.651
I know you guys are going to Montana
for the horse clinic or whatever,

02:03.686 --> 02:04.920
- but it'll only take a minute.
- Amy: Yes.

02:04.954 --> 02:06.721
Lou: And, when you get back,

02:06.756 --> 02:08.223
we should really start
talking about venues.

02:08.258 --> 02:10.157
- Amy: Okay.
- Lou: Okay?

02:10.176 --> 02:11.626
Amy: Okay!

02:11.660 --> 02:13.595
- Lou: Good morning!
- Georgie: Morning!

02:13.629 --> 02:15.597
Can I get a ride into town today.

02:15.631 --> 02:17.665
Peter: Why? What's up?

02:17.700 --> 02:19.567
Georgie: Well,
I'm volunteering at the vet clinic.

02:19.602 --> 02:21.102
You know,
for extra credit in science class.

02:21.136 --> 02:23.104
Peter: Oh. Yeah, sure, I can take you in.

02:23.138 --> 02:24.839
Lou: Uh, it's all right.
You stay here with Katie

02:24.874 --> 02:27.041
and help her get ready for ballet class.

02:27.075 --> 02:30.578
- Come on, kiddo. Let's go.
- Georgie: All right.

02:30.613 --> 02:32.079
Peter: See ya!

02:32.114 --> 02:35.249
(Screen door opens and closes)

02:37.619 --> 02:40.454
Ballet? All right! (Hands clap)

02:40.488 --> 02:44.425
(Car rumbles to a halt)

02:45.105 --> 02:47.758
(Door opens and closes)

02:48.463 --> 02:51.064
Jade: Check out my new ride?
Pretty sweet, huh?

02:51.098 --> 02:52.866
The best part about my parents getting the
"big d"

02:52.901 --> 02:55.368
is the sudden outpouring of generosity.

02:55.403 --> 02:56.937
Nothing like a guilty conscience

02:56.971 --> 03:00.006
to get the parents to loosen
the purse strings a little.

03:00.041 --> 03:01.909
My mom called you a week ago?
She's at a medical conference.

03:01.943 --> 03:03.143
You said I could stay here for the day.

03:03.177 --> 03:04.710
- Lou: Mm. Yeah.
- Jade: You forgot, didn't you?

03:04.745 --> 03:06.379
Lou: No, no, no.
I did not forget. I just...

03:06.414 --> 03:07.948
It's been a busy morning.

03:07.982 --> 03:11.684
I'm gonna drop Georgie at the vet clinic
and I will get you settled in, okay?

03:11.718 --> 03:13.653
Wait. What's going down at the vet clinic?

03:13.687 --> 03:15.521
Is it time for your annual check up?

03:15.556 --> 03:17.623
Georgie: No. I'm just volunteering.

03:17.658 --> 03:19.225
What, like feeding cute animals and stuff?

03:19.260 --> 03:21.300
Georgie: Yeah, I guess.

03:21.320 --> 03:23.239
I want in.

03:23.259 --> 03:24.363
You wanna volunteer?

03:24.397 --> 03:27.366
Well, it beats mucking out
stalls here at the ranch.

03:27.400 --> 03:29.535
Okay. Hop in.

03:29.570 --> 03:31.838
Well, I can drive.

03:31.872 --> 03:34.302
Lou: Uh, no. No. That's not a good idea.

03:34.322 --> 03:36.976
No, Georgie, come...

03:37.010 --> 03:39.078
Georgie: Come on, Lou.
I mean you said you had a busy day.

03:39.112 --> 03:41.280
If Jade takes me, you won't have to worry.

03:41.314 --> 03:45.884
Jade: I promise to obey all traffic laws
and shoulder check before changing lanes.

03:45.918 --> 03:47.986
Georgie: See?
Now that she actually has her license,

03:48.006 --> 03:50.845
she's a lot more responsible.

03:52.192 --> 03:54.826
Lou: Okay. But no speeding and no texting,

03:54.861 --> 03:56.928
and go straight there!

03:56.963 --> 03:59.330
Jade: don't worry, Lou.
Your daughter is in safe hands.

03:59.365 --> 04:00.999
Catch you on the flip side.

04:01.033 --> 04:02.601
(Doors bang shut)

04:02.635 --> 04:04.268
Buckle up. (Engine starts)

04:04.303 --> 04:06.972
(Car rumbles away)

04:07.006 --> 04:09.508
Amy, I thought we were supposed
to be keeping this small?

04:09.542 --> 04:13.456
Amy: Yes, I know. 'Kay, well, let's
just go through and pull some names out.

04:13.476 --> 04:15.913
Okay, um...

04:15.947 --> 04:17.848
How about Lily Borden and Wade Dalton?

04:17.882 --> 04:20.560
Your parents? (Laughs) What do you mean?

04:20.581 --> 04:23.121
Of course we're inviting them.

04:23.155 --> 04:25.656
Ty: Are you sure about that?
Every time I see my mom,

04:25.690 --> 04:27.324
it seems like disaster strikes.

04:27.358 --> 04:30.961
- Why should we tempt fate?
- Amy: You can't be serious.

04:30.996 --> 04:35.032
Come on, Lily would be devastated
if we didn't invite her.

04:35.066 --> 04:38.001
Why do we have to invite anybody at all?

04:38.021 --> 04:40.170
Amy...

04:40.204 --> 04:41.739
We should just get married
in mustang meadows,

04:41.773 --> 04:44.408
just the two of us, under a poplar tree.

04:44.442 --> 04:48.278
If we did that,
Lou would bury us under that same tree.

04:48.312 --> 04:52.315
Ty, let's just start from the
top and work our way down.

04:52.350 --> 04:55.752
Or... we could pack up the
trailer and hit the road.

04:55.786 --> 04:57.754
Come on, Amy. We deserve this trip.

04:57.788 --> 05:01.090
This guest list can wait.

05:01.124 --> 05:02.525
- Amy: 'Kay.
- Ty: 'Kay?

05:02.560 --> 05:04.160
(Amy and Ty giggle excitedly)

05:07.631 --> 05:11.333
(Approaching footsteps)

05:11.368 --> 05:15.022
Peter: Do you know where Katie's,
uh, ballet costume is?

05:16.946 --> 05:19.641
Lou. Hey, you okay? What's going on?

05:19.676 --> 05:23.011
Lou: Actually, I'm not. Um...

05:23.046 --> 05:26.014
"It was a let's-keep-in-touch
kind of thing"?

05:26.049 --> 05:28.217
- Peter: What?
- Lou: Your interview with Tanner Gunn,

05:28.251 --> 05:30.519
you said "it was a let's-keep
in-touch kind of thing."

05:30.554 --> 05:32.455
But it wasn't, was it?

05:32.489 --> 05:33.956
He offered you a job, didn't he?

05:33.990 --> 05:36.785
A good one, in Calgary,
where your family lives,

05:36.805 --> 05:38.594
and you turned it down.

05:38.628 --> 05:41.764
But what's worse is you lied to
me about it and I wanna know why.

05:41.784 --> 05:43.254
(Screen door opens and closes)

05:43.274 --> 05:45.934
- Jack: Look who I found.
- Lisa: Hey, Lou! Hey, Peter, how are you?

05:45.969 --> 05:47.764
- Peter: Hey!
- Lisa: Good to see you.

05:47.784 --> 05:49.703
Peter: Yeah. Long time no see.

05:49.723 --> 05:51.473
- Lisa: Yeah, how are you?
- Peter: Good, good.

05:51.507 --> 05:53.808
(Lisa chuckles)

Cass: Ty, it's Cass.

06:41.188 --> 06:44.615
You didn't tell me I'd be
babysitting two children today.

06:44.635 --> 06:46.459
Do I look like Mary Poppins?

06:46.493 --> 06:50.708
You are now officially taking all
of my night shifts for a month.

06:50.728 --> 06:52.699
Enjoy your trip. (Phone beeps off)

06:53.818 --> 06:55.468
He's so cute.

06:56.002 --> 06:58.837
He also has worms. A real nasty case.

06:58.872 --> 07:01.006
Georgie: Ew!
Should we give him some medicine?

07:01.041 --> 07:02.340
Cass: Nope. Already done.

07:02.375 --> 07:03.709
Just need you to hold him still

07:03.743 --> 07:05.077
while I give him his
yearly booster injection.

07:05.111 --> 07:06.979
Georgie: Okay...

07:07.013 --> 07:08.814
What's wrong with the snake? Is she sick?

07:08.848 --> 07:11.283
What makes you think it's a she?

07:11.317 --> 07:15.187
Jade: A female ball python's tail is
shorter and thinner than a male's.

07:15.221 --> 07:19.123
I did a project on pythons
back in junior high.

07:19.158 --> 07:21.426
Well, her name's Cordelia and
she hasn't eaten in a few weeks,

07:21.460 --> 07:23.461
so we're keeping her here
to see what's going on.

07:23.496 --> 07:24.962
- Jade: Can I hold her?
- Cass: No.

07:24.997 --> 07:29.300
I don't wanna cause her anymore stress
until we find out why she's not eating.

07:29.334 --> 07:33.076
- You can put him back in his cage now.
- Georgie: Okay. (Cat meows)

07:33.535 --> 07:36.941
Cass: Okay, next, I want you two
to take Monty here for a walk.

07:36.975 --> 07:39.310
(Monty pants)

07:39.344 --> 07:42.213
- Georgie: He's adorable.
- Cass: He's a handful.

07:42.247 --> 07:45.583
Georgie: (Laughs) Here, Monty, come here.

07:45.617 --> 07:48.485
Cass: And when Monty does his business,

07:48.520 --> 07:50.954
I need you to collect a urine sample.

07:50.988 --> 07:53.290
- Jade: Seriously?
- Cass: Seriously.

07:53.325 --> 07:55.959
Welcome to the glamorous
world of veterinary medicine.

07:55.993 --> 07:58.596
Oh! And while you're out,
can you pick me up a coffee?

07:58.630 --> 08:01.232
One coffee, one urine sample - no problem.

08:01.266 --> 08:04.034
I'll try not to get the
two of them mixed up.

08:05.845 --> 08:08.178
(Truck rumbles)

08:10.407 --> 08:12.675
(Crows caw, woman sighs heavily)

08:15.146 --> 08:17.080
Why are you driving so slow?

08:17.115 --> 08:19.148
(Chuckles)

08:19.182 --> 08:21.150
My future father-in-law lent me his truck.

08:21.184 --> 08:23.919
There's no way I'm returning it
with even a scratch on it.

08:23.954 --> 08:25.421
I'd never hear the end of it, Amy.

08:25.456 --> 08:27.291
(Amy laughs, phone rings)

08:27.464 --> 08:30.126
Oh... Lou.

08:30.160 --> 08:34.364
You know, she's probably freaking out
about wedding guest lists. (Sighs)

08:34.398 --> 08:36.232
You're not gonna answer it?

08:36.265 --> 08:38.267
We only have until tomorrow together.

08:38.301 --> 08:40.469
Lou's just gonna have to wait.

08:40.503 --> 08:42.703
(Ty and Amy laugh, phone continues ringing)

08:42.739 --> 08:47.823
Peter: Hey.
So, uh, first of all, I didn't lie.

08:48.382 --> 08:50.445
We did say we'd stay in touch
at the end of that meeting.

08:50.480 --> 08:53.181
You just left out the part where
he made you a damn good offer.

08:53.215 --> 08:55.717
Okay, you know, it's funny because...
There was only two people in that meeting,

08:55.752 --> 08:57.852
so I don't know how could know
all that information, but-

08:57.887 --> 08:59.588
Oh, that's right,
you sent your sister to spy for you.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.222
She was hardly spying.

09:01.257 --> 09:03.792
Manipulating, spying, - whatever, Lou.

09:03.826 --> 09:05.468
She was putting her nose
where it didn't belong.

09:05.488 --> 09:07.729
You know what? This is not Amy's fault.

09:07.764 --> 09:10.064
I was the one who asked her to work
for Tanner Gunn in the first place.

09:10.099 --> 09:12.967
Oh, I'm well aware that you were the one
pulling the puppet strings there, Lou.

09:13.002 --> 09:15.970
Something that you didn't tell me
until after the interview, by the way.

09:16.005 --> 09:18.304
So I guess we both lied by omission, right?

09:18.324 --> 09:19.707
Okay, I admit it.

09:19.741 --> 09:22.576
We haven't exactly been
honest with each other lately.

09:22.611 --> 09:25.245
And maybe I shouldn't have set up
the interview behind your back,

09:25.280 --> 09:28.949
but that doesn't change the fact that
you turned down a job offer in Calgary.

09:28.983 --> 09:31.385
I looked for a job in Calgary, Lou.

09:31.420 --> 09:33.688
I looked and looked after
we got back from Dubai,

09:33.722 --> 09:36.457
but no company would touch me,
not after a failure like that.

09:36.491 --> 09:39.593
That was ages ago.
People have short memories.

09:39.628 --> 09:42.329
I've spent years building up
my career in Vancouver, Lou.

09:42.363 --> 09:43.596
I'm not about to just throw it all away

09:43.631 --> 09:45.732
because Tanner Gunn says
I'm back in the club.

09:45.766 --> 09:47.701
He said that was the best
offer you'd get in this town.

09:47.735 --> 09:52.172
Oh, okay.
Yeah, look, it was... It was a good offer.

09:52.207 --> 09:55.209
But I like the job I have
and I cannot stand Tanner.

09:55.243 --> 09:57.044
He's a world class jerk.
I don't wanna work for him.

09:57.078 --> 09:59.612
I just wish you would at least talk to me

09:59.647 --> 10:02.649
before you made up your mind
about something so important.

10:02.683 --> 10:06.486
Oh, right.
Like the way you always... talk to me

10:06.520 --> 10:07.854
before you make up your mind about things.

10:07.888 --> 10:10.156
Lou: don't do that. don't even...

10:10.190 --> 10:12.592
Peter: Don't mention, uh, the house that
you bought without talking to me first?

10:12.626 --> 10:16.128
Or the specialist you sent Katie to
just because some overrated private school

10:16.163 --> 10:18.197
says that she needed it...

10:18.232 --> 10:19.398
A school I didn't even think she
needed to go to in the first place.

10:19.432 --> 10:20.799
Lou: That is not fair, okay?

10:20.834 --> 10:22.801
I thought I was doing
what was best for Katie.

10:22.836 --> 10:24.737
Peter: Oh,
and what about what was best for Georgie

10:24.771 --> 10:26.626
and how you thought that she should
contact her aunt.

10:27.374 --> 10:29.312
Peter: You remember her aunt, right?
The one that called child services on us...

10:29.332 --> 10:30.109
Lou: Stop it!

10:30.143 --> 10:31.359
And said that we were abusing our children?

10:31.379 --> 10:33.379
- Remember that?
- Lou: Just stop it!

10:33.413 --> 10:35.981
Katie: (Humming happily) Peter:
(Gasps) Gosh, look at you!

10:36.015 --> 10:39.718
- Katie: Ta-da!
- Peter: You look awesome!

10:39.753 --> 10:42.287
Lisa: She is all ready for dance class.

10:42.321 --> 10:43.592
- Peter: Thanks.
- Lisa: Yeah.

10:43.612 --> 10:44.982
Peter: I'll take her.

10:45.124 --> 10:47.228
Lou: Have fun!

10:49.095 --> 10:51.796
- Lisa: Everything okay?
- Lou: Yeah, yeah...

10:51.830 --> 10:54.499
(Door closes)

10:54.533 --> 10:56.662
Jade: Is this dog ever gonna pee?

10:56.682 --> 10:58.507
Georgie: (Amused sigh)

11:01.340 --> 11:03.408
Georgie: Can you hold him for a sec?
(Monty barks)

11:03.442 --> 11:05.142
- Jade: Okay. Hey, where are you going?
- Georgie: Yeah, um...

11:05.176 --> 11:07.678
(People chatter)

11:10.081 --> 11:12.249
(Birds chirp, people chatter)

11:14.653 --> 11:16.454
- Jade: What just happened?
- Georgie: Nothing!

11:16.488 --> 11:18.423
Okay, come on, Monty, let's go.

11:18.457 --> 11:20.224
Jade: Uh-uh. You're not getting
out of explaining this one.

11:20.258 --> 11:22.593
You just saw that boy and then you bolted.

11:22.613 --> 11:24.561
Details. Now.

11:24.595 --> 11:26.737
Georgie: Okay, well, there's a
Sadie Hawkins dance at my school...

11:26.757 --> 11:29.199
you know,
girls are supposed to ask the boys.

11:29.774 --> 11:31.035
Sounds kind of dumb, but...

11:31.069 --> 11:34.117
I guess it could be good for a laugh.
Go on.

11:34.137 --> 11:37.419
Okay, well, I'm worried Stephen thinks
I'm gonna ask him to go with me.

11:37.439 --> 11:39.392
- Jade: Are you?
- Georgie: No.

11:39.412 --> 11:41.857
Well then what's the problem?

11:41.877 --> 11:43.680
Unless... You wanna ask him,

11:43.714 --> 11:45.515
but you're just too chicken to do it.

11:45.550 --> 11:48.217
No! We're just friends, okay? That's all.

11:48.252 --> 11:51.916
Why can't a girl and a guy be friends
without it getting all weird?

11:53.159 --> 11:54.424
(Truck rumbles)

11:54.933 --> 11:58.501
Amy: Oh, Ty, pull over.
Just... just right up here, pull over.

11:58.898 --> 12:00.596
(Truck rumbles to a halt)

12:05.606 --> 12:07.236
(Engine shuts off) Ty: Why are we stopping?

12:07.271 --> 12:10.105
Amy: There's a riding trail
not too far off this road.

12:10.139 --> 12:13.275
I used to come here all
the time with my mom.

12:13.309 --> 12:15.210
(Truck doors close)

12:15.244 --> 12:17.613
It is such a beautiful spot, Ty.

12:17.647 --> 12:19.387
I was just thinking...
Since we don't have to be

12:19.407 --> 12:21.917
at the horse clinic until tomorrow,
there's no rush to get there.

12:21.952 --> 12:25.488
- Let's go on a trail ride.
- Ty: Sounds good.

12:25.522 --> 12:27.322
(Footsteps crunch)

12:32.428 --> 12:34.396
- Jade: Here's your caffeine fix.
- Cass: Thank you.

12:34.430 --> 12:36.465
And did you get the urine sample?

12:36.499 --> 12:38.411
Jade: It was a no go.
Either the pipes are broken

12:38.431 --> 12:39.863
or Monty's dehydrated.

12:39.883 --> 12:42.544
That's okay.
You can try again in the afternoon.

12:42.564 --> 12:44.038
I have to head out on a vet call,

12:44.072 --> 12:46.107
but while I'm gone,
I want you to clean out all the kennels.

12:46.141 --> 12:50.350
- We'll get right on it, Dr. Lee.
- Cass: Well, I'm not a Dr. yet,

12:50.370 --> 12:51.880
but I did like the sound of that.

12:51.914 --> 12:54.181
You know what?
You can call me Dr. Lee just for today.

12:54.216 --> 12:57.519
Whatever you say, Dr. Lee.

12:57.553 --> 13:00.021
Georgie: (Sighs) All right,
well, let's get started.

13:00.055 --> 13:01.788
Jade: Cheer up, kid. It's not that bad.

13:01.823 --> 13:03.757
Georgie:
Cleaning kennels and taking urine samples

13:03.791 --> 13:06.427
isn't exactly what I
imagined when I volunteered.

13:06.461 --> 13:07.961
Jade: Well, look on the bright side.

13:07.996 --> 13:09.954
Cass forgot to ask for the
change back from her twenty,

13:09.974 --> 13:11.977
so it's practically a bonus.

13:11.997 --> 13:14.689
And now that she's gone...

13:16.327 --> 13:17.370
Georgie: Hey, should you be doing that?

13:17.405 --> 13:19.205
Cass said we shouldn't touch her.

13:19.240 --> 13:22.910
Jade: I just wanna hold her for a second.

13:22.944 --> 13:25.597
- Wanna give it a try?
- Georgie: No!

13:26.217 --> 13:27.711
No thanks.

13:29.551 --> 13:32.085
Jade: You're not afraid of a
harmless ball python, are you?

13:32.119 --> 13:35.555
Georgie: No. It's just...
she said we should leave her alone.

13:35.589 --> 13:37.457
Jade: Looks like fearless
Georgie isn't as fearless

13:37.477 --> 13:39.959
as we thought, hey, Cordelia?

13:43.905 --> 13:45.498
(Birds chirp, hooves clop)

13:45.533 --> 13:49.455
Ty: You were right, Amy.
This place is incredible.

13:51.471 --> 13:56.119
Amy: Ty, you weren't really serious
about not inviting your mom, were you?

13:58.452 --> 14:00.334
Ty: Well,
I didn't mean it to sound cold, Amy.

14:00.354 --> 14:03.270
It... it's just that uh...

14:04.951 --> 14:06.261
Amy: What?

14:08.054 --> 14:11.421
Ty: It's just the last few times
I talked to my mom on the phone,

14:11.441 --> 14:15.561
she uh... she sounded drunk.

14:17.733 --> 14:20.057
I think she's fallen off the wagon again.

14:20.077 --> 14:22.033
Amy: Are you sure?

14:23.055 --> 14:24.703
Yeah. I know my mom.

14:25.637 --> 14:28.171
I... used to live with her when
she was drinking and high on pills

14:28.206 --> 14:30.621
and I can hear it in her voice.

14:31.477 --> 14:34.719
I don't really want her at our
wedding when she's like that,

14:34.739 --> 14:38.355
but I know it would kill
her not to be there, so...

14:38.375 --> 14:40.961
I'm not really sure what to do right now.

14:41.792 --> 14:44.154
Well, whatever you decide,
I'll stand by you.

14:47.525 --> 14:50.723
Thanks, Amy. Thank you.

14:51.262 --> 14:52.896
But you know what? I don't really want...

14:52.931 --> 14:55.199
to talk about our wedding or my mom.

14:55.233 --> 14:56.899
I just want today to be...
to be about you and me.

14:56.934 --> 15:00.903
Amy: (Chuckles) Okay.

15:00.938 --> 15:02.539
I have something I wanna show you.

15:02.573 --> 15:04.874
(Birds chirp, hooves clop)

15:04.908 --> 15:08.745
(Amy laughs and her breath catches)

15:08.779 --> 15:11.784
- Ty: Wow...
- Amy: I know.

15:13.984 --> 15:15.985
We should just stay out here.

15:16.019 --> 15:18.087
Pitch a tent in the woods,

15:18.121 --> 15:19.755
camp out till the wedding's over.
What do you think?

15:19.789 --> 15:22.491
Amy: What about food?

15:22.525 --> 15:24.126
We could live off the land.

15:24.161 --> 15:26.662
What about bears?

15:26.696 --> 15:28.030
I got bear spray. (Laughs)

15:28.065 --> 15:30.866
(Laughs) Well, what about Lou?

15:30.900 --> 15:32.568
Like I said, I got bear spray.

15:32.602 --> 15:34.636
Amy: (Laughing) Ty...
Ty: (Laughing)

15:34.671 --> 15:37.740
(Water splashes)

15:37.774 --> 15:43.445
♪ Like a Picasso, something priceless ♪

15:43.480 --> 15:47.782
♪ A piece that's only one
of when they speak of... ♪

15:47.816 --> 15:49.851
♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh

15:49.886 --> 15:55.490
♪ oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

15:55.524 --> 15:57.259

15:59.395 --> 16:01.450

16:09.204 --> 16:11.672
(Truck roars by)

16:13.575 --> 16:16.778
(Birds chirp)

16:19.881 --> 16:23.350
(Crows caw, footsteps crunch)

16:30.225 --> 16:32.126
(Birds chirp)

16:34.329 --> 16:37.363
(Door clicks open)

16:46.273 --> 16:47.774
(Keys jingle)

16:51.278 --> 16:52.778
(Door bangs shut, trucks starts)

16:52.813 --> 16:56.682
(Gearshift clunks, truck rumbles away)

17:07.079 --> 17:08.950
Amy: Ty, where's the truck?

17:11.260 --> 17:13.866
This... this is where we parked it, right?

17:13.886 --> 17:16.554
Ty: This is definitely where we parked it.

17:16.588 --> 17:18.916
Someone stole my dad's truck?!

17:20.992 --> 17:23.426
(Frustrated sigh) Do you
have your cell phone?

17:23.462 --> 17:25.135
No, it's in the truck.

17:25.155 --> 17:26.867
Mine too.

17:27.531 --> 17:31.534
Amy: Okay, um...
I say we ride to the nearest town

17:31.569 --> 17:32.635
and we'll call for help.

17:32.670 --> 17:34.872
(Laughs incredulously)

17:34.906 --> 17:36.773
What is funny?

17:38.274 --> 17:40.471
Ty: (Laughing) From now on...

17:40.491 --> 17:44.147
at Christmas, at birthdays,
at family gatherings...

17:44.182 --> 17:45.815
your dad is gonna tell the story

17:45.850 --> 17:49.118
of how his idiot son-in-law lost his truck.

17:49.152 --> 17:50.887
I'm never gonna live this down.

17:50.921 --> 17:53.857
(Laughing)

17:53.891 --> 17:56.959
(Cage door clunks open, spray squirts)

17:58.887 --> 18:00.963
So what's going on with you and that boy,
Stephen?

18:00.998 --> 18:02.598
Georgie: Nothing's going on.

18:02.632 --> 18:04.367
Well, you like him.

18:04.401 --> 18:06.668
Georgie: No, I told you.
We're just friends.

18:06.703 --> 18:08.271
Jade: If you are friends,
you should just go with him.

18:08.305 --> 18:09.738
It's just a Sadie Hawkins Dance...

18:09.773 --> 18:11.340
it's not like... you're proposing marriage.

18:11.375 --> 18:13.209
Oh my God, Jade!

18:13.243 --> 18:14.443
Jade: Look,
I know it's none of my business,

18:14.477 --> 18:16.279
but I do have some experience
with this type of thing...

18:16.313 --> 18:18.447
No! Look!

18:22.218 --> 18:24.019
Oh no...

18:26.456 --> 18:28.757
(Trowel scrapes through dirt)

18:35.197 --> 18:37.365
(Rooster crows in the distance)

18:40.736 --> 18:42.437
Peter: Lou...
Lou: (Exhales shakily)

18:45.374 --> 18:46.341
Can you stop weeding for a second?

18:46.375 --> 18:48.109
I'm not weeding.

18:48.144 --> 18:49.911
Katie was playing out here yesterday

18:49.946 --> 18:51.446
and she buried her plastic cupcake,

18:51.480 --> 18:53.748
and I'm trying to find it.

18:57.252 --> 18:59.186
Well, I'll give you a hand.

19:02.123 --> 19:03.925
(Trowel scrapes in the dirt)

19:03.959 --> 19:07.627
(Sighs) She wanted to plant a cupcake tree.

19:07.662 --> 19:08.829
I didn't have the heart to tell her

19:08.863 --> 19:10.730
it's too cold up here for
cupcake trees to grow.

19:10.765 --> 19:12.333
(Chuckles)

19:18.239 --> 19:21.175
Listen, um...

19:21.209 --> 19:23.577
I was really angry and
I said some things that...

19:23.611 --> 19:26.117
We both said some things.

19:27.782 --> 19:29.583
I'm leaving for Vancouver tonight

19:29.617 --> 19:32.586
and I don't want our last
time to be spent arguing.

19:32.620 --> 19:34.668
Neither do I.

19:38.225 --> 19:40.259
(Trowel scrapes, Peter groans softly)

19:43.763 --> 19:45.922
Both: (Chuckling)
Peter: Is this what you're looking for?

19:46.058 --> 19:48.379
(Chuckles) That's the one.

19:50.670 --> 19:51.937
Amy: Ty...

19:51.972 --> 19:54.007
(Traffic rumbles)

19:54.041 --> 19:57.842
Ty: Are you kidding me? Tire's flat.

19:59.412 --> 20:02.381
Whoever jacked the truck
must have taken off.

20:02.415 --> 20:05.751
(Hooves clop on pavement)

20:05.785 --> 20:07.887
Amy: Our cell phones are still here.

20:07.921 --> 20:09.822
Well, I guess we lucked out.

20:09.856 --> 20:14.092
(Foliage snapping, running footsteps)

20:14.127 --> 20:16.228
Ty: Hold it right there!

20:16.262 --> 20:18.563
Hup! Yah! (Hooves thunder)

20:18.597 --> 20:20.399
Hey, stop! (Hooves thunder)

20:23.636 --> 20:24.903
(Hooves thunder)

20:26.972 --> 20:29.307
Woman: Look, I'm really sorry.

20:29.342 --> 20:31.943
I've never done anything like this before.

20:31.977 --> 20:34.145
And I tried hitchhiking,
but nobody would pick me up.

20:34.179 --> 20:36.714
And then I saw your truck...

20:36.749 --> 20:38.917
I'm not a criminal, I swear.

20:41.153 --> 20:43.270
Please don't call the cops.

20:44.660 --> 20:47.558
Jade: Okay, pythons usually look for dark,
soft places to hide...

20:47.592 --> 20:51.095
like underneath couch cushions.

20:51.129 --> 20:53.531
(Items thump and clatter, Georgie screams)

20:53.565 --> 20:55.634
(Laughs)

20:55.654 --> 20:57.368
Man, the only thing that
scares you more than snakes

20:57.402 --> 20:59.916
is having to ask a boy to a dance.

20:59.936 --> 21:03.974
Okay, well, maybe that sort of thing
comes easily to you, but not me.

21:04.008 --> 21:05.442
Wanna know what I think?

21:05.476 --> 21:07.055
Not really.

21:07.075 --> 21:09.145
Jade: I think the only reason
you're scared to ask Stephen

21:09.180 --> 21:12.449
is because you're afraid he'll say no.

21:12.483 --> 21:14.350
Georgie: Oh my God, there she is!

21:14.385 --> 21:17.120
- Jade: Where?
- Georgie: Right there!

21:17.154 --> 21:19.522
- Jade: Where?
- Georgie: She went behind the fridge.

21:19.557 --> 21:22.258
Jade: Oh, crafty girl.
She's toying with us.

21:22.293 --> 21:24.026
All right, Cordelia, have it your way.

21:24.061 --> 21:26.662
Hide and seek. Ready or not, here we come.

21:26.697 --> 21:30.166
(Peeler blade jingles)

21:30.201 --> 21:32.335
Thank you again for taking
Katie for ice cream.

21:32.369 --> 21:34.170
- She was thrilled.
- Lisa: Aw...

21:34.205 --> 21:37.039
Jack and I are happy to do it.

21:37.074 --> 21:39.969
Hey, Lou? don't mean to pry,

21:39.989 --> 21:41.844
but you're okay, yeah?

21:41.878 --> 21:44.246
Yeah, yeah, why wouldn't I be?

21:44.280 --> 21:46.148
I just heard you and Peter having
a bit of disagreement earlier

21:46.182 --> 21:48.784
and just... not wanting to pry, just...

21:48.819 --> 21:51.520
It's okay. We did have an argument,

21:51.554 --> 21:53.088
but everything is good now.

21:53.123 --> 21:54.988
Good. Glad to hear it.

21:58.314 --> 22:02.664
Lou: Hey, Katie,
that's a really pretty picture.

22:02.698 --> 22:05.066
Katie: That's mommy, that's Georgie,

22:05.101 --> 22:06.968
and this is me and the house we live in.

22:07.003 --> 22:09.303
Lou: Wow! But where's daddy?

22:09.338 --> 22:12.874
Katie: He's up there in the
airplane where he lives.

22:12.908 --> 22:15.076
Lou: Can I see? (Paper rustles)

22:19.080 --> 22:20.780
(Sighs heavily)

22:21.717 --> 22:25.186
(Truck roars by)

22:25.220 --> 22:27.455
So what're we gonna do with her?

22:27.489 --> 22:29.357
What do you mean?

22:29.391 --> 22:32.141
Well, we can't just leave
her at the side of the road.

22:32.699 --> 22:35.963
(Laughs) That's exactly
what we're gonna do.

22:35.997 --> 22:39.033
Amy, she's lucky we didn't call the cops.

22:39.067 --> 22:41.569
Besides, this is our one weekend together

22:41.603 --> 22:43.417
and I'm not gonna let
that girl ruin it for us.

22:43.437 --> 22:45.906
Ty, she's just a kid, okay?

22:45.940 --> 22:48.809
We can at least drop her
off at the nearest town.

22:48.843 --> 22:50.811
(Sighs)

22:51.353 --> 22:53.380
Hi, I'm Amy.

22:53.414 --> 22:54.882
Brook: Brook.

22:54.916 --> 22:57.151
Amy: That's my fiance, Ty.

22:57.185 --> 22:59.018
So where are you headed?

22:59.053 --> 23:00.820
Brook: (Sighs) Not sure yet.

23:00.854 --> 23:02.989
I guess I'll figure it
out when I get there.

23:03.023 --> 23:04.591
Amy: Priddis is not that from here.

23:04.625 --> 23:07.327
We can drop you off if you like.

23:07.361 --> 23:09.497
Brook: Well,
I was hoping to go a little further.

23:09.517 --> 23:11.398
Where are you guys headed?

23:11.432 --> 23:13.567
Amy:
We're going across the border to Montana.

23:13.601 --> 23:16.268
Brook: That's perfect.
Can I get a ride with you?

23:16.303 --> 23:18.237
I won't be any trouble, I promise.

23:18.271 --> 23:19.806
You can even put me in the
trailer with the horses.

23:19.840 --> 23:21.708
You wouldn't even know I was there.

23:21.742 --> 23:24.443
Please, I'm begging you.

23:31.018 --> 23:32.318
(Approaching footsteps)

23:35.555 --> 23:37.389
Lou: (Sighs) Your daughter
thinks you live on an airplane.

23:37.424 --> 23:38.557
(Drawing flutters)

23:38.592 --> 23:40.058
Peter: What?

23:42.754 --> 23:47.073
Lou: You know, kids have a funny way
of getting at the truth sometimes.

23:47.093 --> 23:50.769
But you don't live on an airplane,
Peter, you live in Vancouver.

23:50.803 --> 23:53.138
And I thought it was because
you had the great job there,

23:53.172 --> 23:57.308
but... that's not the real reason, is it?

23:57.343 --> 23:59.644
I thought we were gonna let
this go until I came back?

23:59.678 --> 24:02.313
Lou: I wanna talk about it now.

24:02.348 --> 24:04.137
Peter: Okay.

24:04.621 --> 24:07.385
Well, you know why I didn't
take the job in Calgary, Lou.

24:07.419 --> 24:09.621
Yeah, I thought it was just about a job,
but...

24:09.655 --> 24:11.935
but maybe it's not. I mean, maybe...

24:11.955 --> 24:14.325
There's something else.
There's something keeping you in Vancouver,

24:14.360 --> 24:18.596
away from me and away from your family.

24:19.046 --> 24:22.066
Something or... maybe someone?

24:22.100 --> 24:24.334
Oh... how could you even suggest that?

24:24.369 --> 24:26.737
Then what is it? Help me understand.

24:26.771 --> 24:29.239
(Knock at the door, door creaks open)

24:29.274 --> 24:32.643
Jack: Uh...
Lisa just put lunch on the table.

24:32.677 --> 24:34.778
Oh, great. We'll be there in a second.

24:34.812 --> 24:37.867
Jack: All right. (Door creaks closed)

24:41.491 --> 24:43.253
Peter: (Laughs) That's awesome.

24:43.287 --> 24:46.956
We don't even have enough privacy to argue.

24:46.991 --> 24:49.325
- Amy: Doesn't it scare you?
- Brook: What?

24:49.359 --> 24:51.427
Amy: Not knowing where you're going?

24:51.461 --> 24:54.330
(Laughs) Are you kidding?
I've never been happier.

24:54.364 --> 24:57.767
I do what I want. I go where I want.

24:57.801 --> 24:59.802
No rules, just endless possibilities.

24:59.836 --> 25:02.905
What about your home?

25:02.939 --> 25:05.708
Don't have one. Not really.

25:05.742 --> 25:08.644
My mom pretty much kicked me out
of the house a few months ago.

25:08.679 --> 25:10.245
I lived with a boyfriend for awhile,

25:10.280 --> 25:12.748
but, of course,
he turned out to be a total jerk,

25:12.783 --> 25:14.917
just like my mom said.

25:14.951 --> 25:16.785
Now I'm free as a bird.

25:16.820 --> 25:19.754
Amy: (Chuckles politely)

25:19.789 --> 25:21.824
- Ty: Hey.
- Amy: Hey.

25:21.858 --> 25:23.258
It's gonna take about an
hour to patch the tire,

25:23.293 --> 25:25.127
so we might as well get
something to eat while we wait.

25:25.161 --> 25:27.062
Lunch is on me. It's the least I could do

25:27.096 --> 25:29.564
since I stole your truck and all.

25:29.598 --> 25:32.967
But first, I need to make some money.

25:33.001 --> 25:34.369
Ty: What?

25:34.403 --> 25:37.872
(People chatter nearby)

25:37.906 --> 25:40.241
I was thinking of a roast beef for dinner.
Everybody all right with that?

25:40.275 --> 25:42.176
Jack: Mm! That sounds good to me.

25:42.211 --> 25:43.545
Lou: You can count on some leftovers though

25:43.579 --> 25:45.814
because Peter is headed back to Vancouver,
as usual.

25:45.848 --> 25:47.912
Aren't you, Peter?

25:49.500 --> 25:53.496
Probably just grab some dinner
at the airport, right, honey?

25:54.340 --> 25:55.857
Lisa: That's fine.

25:55.891 --> 25:57.691
Leftovers are no problem.
We'll have them for lunch tomorrow.

25:57.726 --> 26:00.194
- Good sandwiches.
- Jack: Mm-hmm.

26:00.229 --> 26:01.963
Lou: There's watermelon
in the fridge for dessert.

26:01.997 --> 26:03.864
Does anyone want some?

26:03.898 --> 26:06.767
(Chair scrapes back)

26:06.801 --> 26:09.537
Peter: I'm just gonna give her a hand.
We'll just be one sec.

26:09.557 --> 26:11.059
(Plate thuds on table)

26:13.074 --> 26:15.394
Do you mind telling me what you're doing?
Wh-wh-what's going on?

26:15.414 --> 26:16.643
Do you wanna keep your voice down?

26:16.678 --> 26:18.278
- Peter: What?
- I'm just making sure everyone is aware

26:18.312 --> 26:20.113
of your very complicated schedule.

26:20.147 --> 26:21.614
Did I say something that wasn't true?

26:21.648 --> 26:23.549
You are headed back to Vancouver now.

26:23.584 --> 26:26.319
Yeah, Lou. I'm headed back to
my pied-a-terre in Vancouver

26:26.354 --> 26:28.313
where I throw wild parties and have
illicit affairs every night, yeah.

26:28.333 --> 26:30.556
Oh, you said it, not me.

26:30.591 --> 26:33.326
I ask for one thing...
to keep my job in Vancouver, Lou,

26:33.361 --> 26:35.262
and you accuse me of having an affair?

26:35.296 --> 26:37.301
- Lou: I did not accuse you.
- Peter: Oh, it's implied!

26:37.321 --> 26:39.432
Please, don't-don't even!

26:39.466 --> 26:43.936
Jack: So we're not very hungry on
account of the ice cream, I guess, so...

26:43.970 --> 26:46.526
Katie wants to see her pony.
We'll take her out.

26:46.662 --> 26:48.641
Lou: That sounds like fun.

26:48.675 --> 26:51.143
Lisa: Yeah, we'll be back in a bit.

26:51.867 --> 26:53.567
Thanks.

26:55.937 --> 26:58.550
(Door closes, Peter sighs)

26:58.584 --> 27:01.853
Lou: I did not mean to accuse
you of having an affair.

27:01.888 --> 27:04.290
Peter,
all I want is for you to put your family

27:04.324 --> 27:07.059
before whatever it is in
Vancouver that is so important!

27:07.093 --> 27:08.560
Peter: "Whatever it is"? My job, Lou?

27:08.594 --> 27:10.261
Is that what you're talking about?

27:10.296 --> 27:13.031
What about you? We could move to Vancouver.

27:13.051 --> 27:15.734
Remember that? Why am I the only
one who has to give up everything?

27:15.768 --> 27:18.937
I have given up just as much in
this relationship and you know it!

27:18.971 --> 27:22.040
I moved my entire life to
Dubai when we got married.

27:22.074 --> 27:23.508
Peter: Right. There it is, and you'll
never let me forget it, will you?

27:23.543 --> 27:25.527
- Lou: What?!
- That's what this is all about, right?

27:25.547 --> 27:26.127
Lou: No!

27:26.147 --> 27:28.446
Peter: I screwed up over
there and you will never let it go.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.315
- Lou: No!
- That's why you won't move to Vancouver,

27:30.349 --> 27:32.683
that's why you're stuck here
clinging to your life at Heartland...

27:32.717 --> 27:34.852
because you're terrified that Peter's
gonna screw everything up again!

27:34.886 --> 27:37.621
- Lou: That is not true!
- Peter: It is true!

27:37.656 --> 27:40.691
(Angry exhale)

27:41.589 --> 27:43.274
Yes it is.

27:43.753 --> 27:46.964
I moved on with my life after Dubai.
I ca-I can't...

27:46.998 --> 27:49.948
You're stuck living in the past and I...
I can't take it. I don't...

27:49.968 --> 27:52.135
Peter...

27:52.170 --> 27:55.105
(Exhales slowly) We can't go on like this.

27:55.798 --> 27:59.508
Lou: No. No, we can't.

28:04.015 --> 28:06.564
I think that's the first
thing we've agreed on all day.

28:51.284 --> 28:54.118
I do wanna ask Stephen to go with me,
but...

28:54.153 --> 28:57.334
What if he says no? It would be so awkward.

28:57.354 --> 29:00.224

29:00.258 --> 29:03.294
I swear I will totally deny ever saying it.

29:03.328 --> 29:07.636
But, Georgie, you are smart, and brave...

29:08.067 --> 29:09.726
except when it comes to snakes...

29:09.746 --> 29:11.635
and kind of beautiful

29:11.670 --> 29:13.671
in a diamond in the rough kind of way,

29:13.706 --> 29:18.108
and there is no way that that skinny,
awkward,

29:18.142 --> 29:21.483
pre-pubescent boy is
ever gonna say no to you.

29:21.694 --> 29:22.946
And if he does,

29:22.980 --> 29:25.941
he's not worth the price of

29:27.852 --> 29:30.036
(Gasps) Cordelia, there you are!

29:32.591 --> 29:35.859
I have been looking everywhere for you.

29:35.893 --> 29:37.560
Oh, look,
she even has a little bump in her belly.

29:37.595 --> 29:40.363
She must've found something to eat.

29:40.397 --> 29:43.399
Do you know what this means? I cured her.

29:43.434 --> 29:45.368
I totally deserve an honorary vet degree.

29:45.402 --> 29:48.988
I'd be Dr. Jade - super model slash vet.

29:49.008 --> 29:52.642
They'd be all like, "Dr. Jade why were
you late for your swimsuit shoot?"

29:52.676 --> 29:56.510
And I'd be all like,
"I was saving a tiny koala bear."

29:57.466 --> 30:01.451
Georgie: Jade, you know that tiny chihuahua
Cass was giving the shot to?

30:01.485 --> 30:04.854
- Jade: Yeah.
- Georgie: He's gone.

30:04.888 --> 30:06.922
Jade: What do you mean, gone?

30:06.957 --> 30:10.250
Georgie: Well,
his kennel is open and he's not there.

30:11.461 --> 30:14.196
No... you don't think...?

30:14.231 --> 30:15.998
Jade: Well, actually,
ball pythons can eat almost anything

30:16.032 --> 30:17.233
up to double their thickness.

30:17.267 --> 30:19.101
Don't say that.

30:19.136 --> 30:20.736
And they can dislocate their jaw.

30:20.771 --> 30:22.621
Georgie: (Worried sigh)

30:24.206 --> 30:27.075
We are in so much trouble...

32:00.466 --> 32:04.572
(Crowd claps and cheers) All right! Yeah!

32:04.725 --> 32:05.611
Amy: Wow.

32:05.631 --> 32:07.638
Brook: I thought I was
the only one who knew that song.

32:07.673 --> 32:09.039
Amy:
My grandmother used to sing that song to me

32:09.074 --> 32:10.842
all the time when I was a kid.

32:10.876 --> 32:13.077
Get out!
Your grandma was a fan of Lyndy Bartlett?

32:13.111 --> 32:16.146
No. My grandma was Lyndy Bartlett.

32:16.181 --> 32:18.163
(Amy chuckles, brook gasps)

32:22.788 --> 32:25.655
Lou: I need to explain something to you.

32:25.690 --> 32:28.259
When we lost everything in Dubai

32:28.293 --> 32:30.494
and we had to rebuild our lives

32:30.528 --> 32:35.366
and everything was so bleak,
and I was pregnant with Katie,

32:35.400 --> 32:37.467
I did what I had to do, Peter,

32:37.502 --> 32:40.504
and moving back here was
the right thing to do.

32:40.538 --> 32:43.740
And then Georgie came into our lives...

32:43.775 --> 32:45.542
And she's so attached to this place.

32:45.576 --> 32:47.677
You know that.

32:47.712 --> 32:50.847
You might think I'm stuck in the past,

32:50.882 --> 32:54.083
but I've only ever done what is
best for this family's future.

32:54.118 --> 32:56.953
Peter: (Sighs) This living here,

32:56.987 --> 33:00.856
this was all supposed to be temporary,
remember?

33:00.891 --> 33:02.758
And... somewhere along the line,

33:02.793 --> 33:05.594
we started living separate lives and...

33:05.629 --> 33:07.230
we stopped making decisions together.

33:07.264 --> 33:09.765
(Sighs heavily)

33:09.800 --> 33:13.134
I think what we have to ask ourselves is...

33:14.704 --> 33:19.909
I mean, aside from Georgie and Katie,
what do we...

33:20.315 --> 33:22.110
What's keeping us together?

33:22.145 --> 33:23.712
(Sighs heavily)

33:30.820 --> 33:33.987
I cannot believe I am eating lunch
with Lyndy Bartlett's granddaughter.

33:34.007 --> 33:35.135
How wicked is that?

33:35.155 --> 33:37.657
I'm just surprised someone
your age even knows who she is.

33:37.691 --> 33:39.458
Brook: Well,
I found her album at a used record store.

33:39.493 --> 33:42.694
Her lyrics are insane, and her voice...

33:42.729 --> 33:46.565
It was like a cross between
Kitty Wells and Tammy Wynette.

33:46.599 --> 33:49.301
I always imagined her
traveling the country,

33:49.336 --> 33:52.304
singing in dive bars, really living life.

33:52.339 --> 33:54.106
Amy: I'm sure she did that for awhile.

33:54.141 --> 33:57.143
But then she met my grandpa
and her life changed.

33:57.177 --> 34:00.679
They settled down, had a kid, my mom.

34:00.713 --> 34:04.950
And she never stopped singing,
just not on a stage anymore.

34:04.984 --> 34:07.986
You know, we should go on the road
together. We'd make a killer duo.

34:08.021 --> 34:10.621
(Laughs) Thanks for the offer,
but I just got back from tour...

34:10.657 --> 34:13.458
Not singing - training horses in Europe.

34:13.492 --> 34:14.659
I thought that's what I wanted,

34:14.694 --> 34:17.362
but I guess I'm a bit like my grandma

34:17.396 --> 34:20.264
'cause I realized everything
I want is right here.

34:20.299 --> 34:21.866
(Birds chirp)

34:24.770 --> 34:29.192
Jade: And... that's when we noticed
the chihuahua wasn't in his cage.

34:30.487 --> 34:31.806
Georgie: Look, we're really sorry.

34:31.827 --> 34:34.210
We didn't mean for any of this to happen.

34:34.245 --> 34:36.701
Jade: On the bright side,
Cordelia's hunger strike is over.

34:36.721 --> 34:39.083
Are you two finished?

34:39.117 --> 34:41.619
Jade: Yeah, that's pretty much it.

34:41.652 --> 34:43.588
Cass: You'll be relieved to know Mrs.
Blatchford stopped by to pick up her dog

34:43.621 --> 34:45.699
while you two were out getting coffee.

34:45.719 --> 34:47.858
(Jade sighs with relief)

34:47.893 --> 34:51.261
Georgie: Well,
what about the bump in her belly?

34:51.295 --> 34:54.764
She obviously ate the food I put in
her enclosure before she escaped.

34:54.799 --> 34:56.199
Jade: Well, that's great news.

34:56.234 --> 34:58.902
I mean, no harm no foul, right?

34:58.936 --> 35:02.372
I guess Georgie and I'll be on our way now.
Thanks for everything, Dr. Lee.

35:02.407 --> 35:05.809
Mm. Not so fast. I think I was very clear

35:05.843 --> 35:08.912
when I told you not to touch Cordelia.

35:08.946 --> 35:12.148
But since she appears to be fine,
I'm gonna let it go.

35:12.182 --> 35:15.418
I will however need my change back
from the twenty I gave you for coffee.

35:15.452 --> 35:18.855
(Clothing and cash rustles)

35:18.889 --> 35:21.357
And I still need that
urine sample from Monty.

35:21.391 --> 35:23.426
This time don't come back empty handed.

35:23.460 --> 35:25.960
Georgie: (Sighs)

35:27.197 --> 35:28.664
(Kennel door opens)

35:29.178 --> 35:31.100
Peter: Give me a kiss. Mm... Muah!

35:31.135 --> 35:33.269
- Here.
- Lou: Here.

35:33.303 --> 35:34.887
(Lou and Peter groan)

35:35.569 --> 35:36.739
Okay, uh...

35:36.773 --> 35:38.907
So tell Georgie that I'll call
her from the airport, okay?

35:38.942 --> 35:41.777
Please? Thanks. Um...

35:41.811 --> 35:44.513
- Give her a hug for me.
- I will.

35:44.947 --> 35:47.682
And uh... we'll talk when I get back.

35:47.716 --> 35:50.285
- Lou: Okay.
- Peter: Okay.

35:50.319 --> 35:52.187
Bye, guys.

35:52.221 --> 35:54.122
Lou: Bye, daddy.

35:54.157 --> 35:56.736
(Door opens, taxi engine starts)

35:58.503 --> 36:00.361
(Door bangs shut)

36:00.395 --> 36:02.730
I think it's time for your nap.

36:02.765 --> 36:05.134
Why don't you go pick out a storybook,
'kay?

36:05.154 --> 36:06.681
(Sniffs)

36:10.539 --> 36:13.307
(Running footsteps, screen door opens)

36:13.931 --> 36:16.877
Jack: You okay, Lou?

36:16.911 --> 36:20.539
Lou: I don't know... (Door snaps shut)

36:21.792 --> 36:23.916
Lisa: We have to do something.

36:23.951 --> 36:25.520
I know what you're gonna
say that we shouldn't metal,

36:25.540 --> 36:27.554
but I just-I can't stand
to see her like that.

36:27.588 --> 36:29.822
Jack: Neither can I.

36:30.382 --> 36:32.925
Do you have your phone on you?

36:32.960 --> 36:36.575
- Lisa: Who are you going to call?
- Jack: Reinforcements.

36:37.071 --> 36:38.664
Ty: How long you been running for?

36:38.699 --> 36:40.900
What makes you think I'm a runaway?

36:40.934 --> 36:43.002
Well, it takes one to know one.

36:43.036 --> 36:45.738
When I was your age,
I was all over the map.

36:45.772 --> 36:49.075
Anytime things got tough,
I'd run the other way.

36:49.109 --> 36:51.477
Well, I'm not running away from anything.

36:51.511 --> 36:53.712
I'm running towards something.

36:53.746 --> 36:59.165
Oh. Okay. And what's that?
Fame and fortune?

36:59.851 --> 37:01.686
Yeah, why not?

37:01.721 --> 37:03.953
I deserve it just as much as anybody.

37:03.973 --> 37:05.649
Ty: Hmm.

37:06.859 --> 37:10.761
What about... What about your parents?

37:11.097 --> 37:13.231
Do they must miss you.

37:13.265 --> 37:17.769
It was just me and my mom.
We never really got along.

37:18.145 --> 37:21.072
We haven't spoken in months.

37:21.107 --> 37:24.008
Ty: Well, you know,
I didn't speak to my mom for years.

37:24.713 --> 37:26.736
She uh...

37:27.480 --> 37:29.880
Well, she can be a bit of
a train wreck sometimes.

37:29.914 --> 37:33.083
Earlier today, I was actually thinking
about not inviting her to my wedding.

37:33.118 --> 37:35.816
Well, if she's anything like my mom,

37:35.836 --> 37:37.488
I don't blame you.

37:37.523 --> 37:39.690
Ty: You know, it's funny, I...

37:39.724 --> 37:41.825
Here I am not wanting to invite my mom,

37:41.860 --> 37:44.028
and Amy, on the other hand,

37:44.062 --> 37:46.664
she'd do anything to have her mom there.

37:47.031 --> 37:49.253
But that's never gonna happen.

37:49.273 --> 37:51.301
Why not?

37:52.008 --> 37:54.038
Her mom's dead.

37:54.674 --> 37:57.788
Oh... Oh, that's so sad.

37:58.446 --> 38:00.709
Ty: Yeah, but... at least she
had a good relationship with her

38:00.729 --> 38:03.012
before she passed away.

38:03.273 --> 38:06.717
You and me, we got some stuff to work out

38:06.737 --> 38:09.186
when it comes to our moms.

38:09.220 --> 38:12.400
But I guess we're lucky
'cause it's not too late for that.

38:12.420 --> 38:14.023
It is for me.

38:14.058 --> 38:15.692
Ty: Are you sure about that?

38:15.726 --> 38:18.494
Amy: I just got off the phone with grandpa.
We've gotta go back home.

38:18.528 --> 38:21.030
- Ty: Why? What's going on?
- Amy: I'll... explain on the way.

38:21.065 --> 38:23.183
Brook,
I am really sorry we're not gonna be able

38:23.203 --> 38:25.017
to take you to Montana.

38:25.803 --> 38:29.365
Ty: Uh, brook, maybe we can,
um, drop you off

38:29.385 --> 38:31.842
at your mom's place.

38:33.456 --> 38:36.612
No... no, I'll uh...
I'll find my own way south.

38:36.646 --> 38:38.835
- Amy: You sure?
- Brook: Yeah.

38:38.855 --> 38:40.982
Thanks for everything.

38:41.585 --> 38:44.052
And sorry I stole your truck.

38:44.551 --> 38:48.489
- Ty: It's okay.
- Amy: Just be safe.

38:49.139 --> 38:50.765
Ty: See you, Brook.

38:52.701 --> 38:55.563
Here, I got it. (Door clicks open)

38:56.300 --> 38:58.666
(Door bangs shut)

38:59.721 --> 39:00.802
Brook: Wait!

39:06.268 --> 39:08.363
Come on Monty. Give us a break.

39:08.383 --> 39:10.140
You've been drinking water all day.

39:10.160 --> 39:12.742
- Just pee already!
- Stephen: Hey, Georgie. (Monty barks)

39:12.933 --> 39:14.951
Georgie: (Brightly) Oh, hi!

39:14.971 --> 39:17.259
Steven: I got your message.
What do you wanna talk to me about?

39:17.279 --> 39:20.206
Jade: I'll give you two a minute.
Come on. Come on, Monty!

39:20.240 --> 39:23.509
- You know the Sadie Hawkins Dance?
- Stephen: Yeah.

39:24.072 --> 39:26.542
Well, are-are you going?

39:26.777 --> 39:29.815
I don't know. Maybe. Are you?

39:29.849 --> 39:32.188
Georgie: Yeah. I think so.
I mean it's kinda dumb,

39:32.208 --> 39:35.980
but it could be a good laugh.

39:36.523 --> 39:39.447
So I was wondering um...
If you wanted to go with me?

39:39.467 --> 39:42.094
- Like only if you want...
- Stephen: Yes!

39:42.129 --> 39:45.764
I mean... yeah, that'd be totally cool.

39:45.798 --> 39:48.934
Georgie: Okay. (Giggles)

39:48.968 --> 39:51.103
Jade: Georgie! I got the urine sample!

39:51.137 --> 39:53.772
Georgie:
(Laughs) I don't even know who that is.

39:53.806 --> 39:55.473
Stephen: I gotta go.

39:55.508 --> 39:58.587
Jade: Good boy. Good boy.

39:59.612 --> 40:01.579
- Georgie: Seriously?
- Jade: Well...

40:02.405 --> 40:03.714
(Truck rumbles to a halt)

40:03.749 --> 40:04.849
Brook: (Sighs nervously) Okay.

40:04.883 --> 40:06.618
(Truck idles loudly)

40:12.030 --> 40:13.743
(Door bangs shut)

40:19.297 --> 40:21.899
Congrats by the way on
getting married and all.

40:21.933 --> 40:23.740
If you need somebody to
sing at your wedding,

40:23.760 --> 40:24.720
keep me in mind.

40:24.740 --> 40:27.420
- Amy: We'll do.
- Ty: Good luck, Brook.

40:27.855 --> 40:29.753
(Truck idles loudly, brook sighs nervously)

40:37.232 --> 40:38.870
(Door opens)

40:51.128 --> 40:53.329
Brook's mom: (Sobbing) Welcome home.

40:53.363 --> 40:55.799
(Crickets chirp)

40:55.833 --> 40:58.101
Lou: You were really looking
forward to that horse clinic.

40:58.135 --> 41:00.369
There'll be lots of other clinics, Lou.

41:00.404 --> 41:02.605
I only have one sister.

41:02.639 --> 41:05.408
(Crying) Thank you.

41:05.442 --> 41:07.110
Ugh, it's that...

41:07.144 --> 41:09.011
Peter and I have had terrible fights,

41:09.045 --> 41:11.847
but never anything like this.

41:11.881 --> 41:14.817
I just wanna talk to him about it.
He says we'll talk when he gets back,

41:14.851 --> 41:17.497
but I don't think I can wait that long.

41:17.517 --> 41:19.555
Should I call him?

41:19.590 --> 41:22.592
I think this is the type of conversation
that you should have in person.

41:22.626 --> 41:26.359
Yeah, but what am I supposed to do?
Hop on the next flight to Vancouver?

41:31.683 --> 41:34.369
I need to go to Vancouver.

41:34.403 --> 41:36.243
(Emotional sigh)

41:36.541 --> 41:39.589

42:04.199 --> 42:06.600
- Georgie: Okay.
- And I'll be back before you know it.

42:06.635 --> 42:09.082
Georgie: All right, have fun.

42:09.938 --> 42:15.743
Lou: And you... you be a good girl
for grandpa, okay, and have fun.

42:15.777 --> 42:18.245
Amy: Hey, Lou, we gotta leave now,
or you're gonna miss your plane.

42:26.453 --> 42:28.688
