WEBVTT

00:03.141 --> 00:04.107
What?

00:04.196 --> 00:06.430
Uh, nothing.

00:06.613 --> 00:08.849
I'm gonna go over to there now.

00:09.567 --> 00:11.715
Jake, what's going on?
Why is Amy's hair like that?

00:11.750 --> 00:14.451
Oh, she obsessively braids
her hair when she's nervous,

00:14.486 --> 00:15.785
and she's super nervous
'cause she's taking

00:15.821 --> 00:16.953
the sergeant's exam today.

00:16.988 --> 00:18.221
But Amy loves tests.

00:18.256 --> 00:19.556
Not this one. It's always been her plan

00:19.591 --> 00:21.591
to be the youngest captain
in the history of the NYPD,

00:21.626 --> 00:23.093
but if she doesn't pass this exam,

00:23.128 --> 00:24.994
she's gonna have to wait another
three years to take it again,

00:25.030 --> 00:26.996
and that'll disrupt
her entire life calendar.

00:27.022 --> 00:28.262
Is that a real thing?

00:28.288 --> 00:29.344
It hangs over our bed.

00:29.370 --> 00:30.777
So she's stress-braiding. Big deal.

00:30.803 --> 00:32.531
That's like a one on the
Santiago Panic Scale.

00:32.557 --> 00:34.604
Yeah, but we've also
jumped up to level two,

00:34.639 --> 00:36.973
creepily singing songs from
the Great American Songbook.

00:37.008 --> 00:39.809
♪ You're a grand old flag ♪

00:39.845 --> 00:43.012
♪ You're a high flying flag ♪

00:43.048 --> 00:44.447
So, yeah, it's a little tough right now,

00:44.483 --> 00:46.082
but I think the worst is behind us.

00:46.118 --> 00:50.053
Why are you taking so long
to cook my frickin' oatmeal?

00:51.089 --> 00:52.055
Yeah... oh.

01:00.920 --> 01:01.853
She'll be okay.

01:24.623 --> 01:25.722
Hey, babe.

01:25.757 --> 01:26.723
Oh!

01:26.758 --> 01:28.725
I see you've taken the braids out.

01:28.760 --> 01:29.926
Your hair looks fun.

01:29.961 --> 01:31.327
Now it's ready for me to braid again.

01:31.363 --> 01:34.030
Okay. Ames, I don't want you
to take this the wrong way,

01:34.065 --> 01:36.746
but you gotta calm the "F train" down.

01:36.772 --> 01:38.205
You're going to ace this test.

01:38.231 --> 01:40.961
You think that because you love me,
and love has made you dumb.

01:40.987 --> 01:42.967
I disagree, if anything,
love has made me smarter.

01:42.993 --> 01:44.617
Remember last week
when I boiled that egg?

01:44.643 --> 01:45.992
That was big. I was really proud of you.

01:46.018 --> 01:48.528
Yes, and...
hold onto your crazy-ass hair...

01:48.554 --> 01:49.979
because I'm about to prove
to you that you have

01:50.015 --> 01:51.940
nothing to worry about. Follow me.

01:52.008 --> 01:53.140
Practice test.

01:53.166 --> 01:54.326
You ace it, you relax,

01:54.352 --> 01:56.085
you nail the real one,
you become a sergeant,

01:56.121 --> 01:58.087
you make grateful love to me
for 14 hours straight.

01:58.123 --> 01:59.823
- Jake...
- Fine, one hour.

01:59.858 --> 02:01.491
15 minutes. Eight.

02:01.693 --> 02:03.793
- Three but they're mind-blowing.
- I told you a million times...

02:03.829 --> 02:05.161
You don't really want more than three.

02:05.197 --> 02:06.996
No, practice exams are worthless.

02:07.032 --> 02:09.164
The testing conditions
are way too pristine.

02:09.201 --> 02:11.334
There's nothing to distract you.
I mean, look around.

02:11.369 --> 02:13.403
A child could pass the
frickin' MCAT in here.

02:13.429 --> 02:14.537
I knew you would say that,

02:14.573 --> 02:17.140
which is why I've asked
these officers...

02:17.175 --> 02:19.642
to do their paperwork in here
while you take the test.

02:19.678 --> 02:22.078
He writes way too loudly.
She's always yawning.

02:22.113 --> 02:23.413
He has a gross cold.

02:23.448 --> 02:25.448
IBS, IBS.

02:25.484 --> 02:27.650
She has a weird arm-stretching thing.

02:27.686 --> 02:30.820
IBS, IBS, and Hitchcock and Scully

02:30.856 --> 02:32.522
with two hours worth of potato chips.

02:32.557 --> 02:34.557
Oh, my God, it's gonna be crinkle-city.

02:34.593 --> 02:36.326
Jake said we get to eat
with our mouths open.

02:36.361 --> 02:38.061
What a day!

02:38.096 --> 02:41.598
Babe, take the practice test.
Then you'll know you're ready.

02:41.633 --> 02:44.167
Okay. See you in two hours.

02:45.270 --> 02:47.237
Sir, a witness just
came in with her child.

02:47.272 --> 02:50.173
While she was being interviewed,
I took the kid to the soft room,

02:50.208 --> 02:52.375
and the toy situation in
there is kind of bleak.

02:52.410 --> 02:54.110
Is this your opinion
or the child's opinion?

02:54.145 --> 02:55.378
- It's mine.
- Trick question.

02:55.413 --> 02:57.280
Any opinion about toys
is a child's opinion.

02:57.315 --> 02:59.749
All we have in there are toys
from the movie "Kazaam,"

02:59.784 --> 03:01.518
and none of 'em are even Kazaam.

03:03.121 --> 03:04.821
I have an extra graphing calculator

03:04.856 --> 03:06.089
I could leave in there for the children.

03:06.124 --> 03:09.759
Um, I was thinking we could
liven things up in there.

03:09.794 --> 03:11.594
Maybe add a model train?

03:11.881 --> 03:13.247
I used to love 'em when I was a kid.

03:13.273 --> 03:15.598
I was also a model train
enthusiast as a child.

03:15.634 --> 03:17.267
Those miniature tracks provided me

03:17.302 --> 03:19.102
with some of my happiest memories.

03:19.137 --> 03:20.970
All aboard!

03:21.006 --> 03:23.793
The train will be departing
in 45 minutes.

03:29.948 --> 03:31.636
I like this idea, Jeffords.

03:31.662 --> 03:32.961
I'll help you build the train set.

03:32.987 --> 03:34.751
Sweet! This'll be fun!

03:34.786 --> 03:36.019
I hope not.

03:36.288 --> 03:37.452
It's trains.

03:37.843 --> 03:39.188
Gina, as you know,

03:39.224 --> 03:41.257
Great Nana Boyle recently passed.

03:41.293 --> 03:44.861
Yes, I watched the live stream
of the plug-pulling ceremony.

03:44.896 --> 03:46.829
Anyway, they executed her will.

03:47.108 --> 03:48.474
- Guess what she left me?
- No.

03:48.500 --> 03:49.900
Her silk bed sheets.

03:49.926 --> 03:52.621
They were very special to her.
She insisted on dying in them.

03:52.647 --> 03:54.604
Don't get jealous. She
left you something too.

03:54.639 --> 03:57.707
Oh, that's so nice of her.

03:57.742 --> 04:00.510
And it's a big jar of brown sludge

04:00.545 --> 04:01.744
that smells like death.

04:01.780 --> 04:03.713
Oh, you got the mother dough!

04:03.748 --> 04:05.715
Ugh! Did this come out of her?

04:05.750 --> 04:08.017
Charles, how grossed out
should I be right now?

04:08.053 --> 04:10.286
No, that's the Boyle family
sourdough starter.

04:10.322 --> 04:12.322
It's fed us for 140 years.

04:12.357 --> 04:16.759
The bread it births is succulent
and firm... tang for days.

04:16.795 --> 04:19.195
I hate so many of the
words you just used.

04:19.230 --> 04:21.664
Charles, if it's so great,
why would she give it to me?

04:21.700 --> 04:22.932
I barely knew her.

04:22.968 --> 04:24.334
You know what, she
probably got you confused

04:24.369 --> 04:27.036
with my cousin Tina. He
was always her favorite.

04:27.072 --> 04:28.471
Tina is a boy's name?

04:28.506 --> 04:30.039
- Yeah, short for Christina.
- Mm.

04:30.075 --> 04:31.641
You're right, it's pretty gross.

04:31.676 --> 04:33.543
You don't bake bread.
Let me take it off your hands.

04:33.578 --> 04:34.544
Oh, Charles.

04:34.579 --> 04:37.046
Charles, Charles, Charles.

04:37.082 --> 04:39.282
You already showed your cards, baby boy.

04:39.317 --> 04:40.917
You know how badly you want this,

04:40.952 --> 04:42.385
so you're gonna have to pay for it.

04:42.420 --> 04:43.419
Gina, please.

04:43.455 --> 04:44.854
No, I'll take $10,000.

04:44.889 --> 04:46.823
What? Are you out of your mind?

04:46.858 --> 04:48.224
- Probably.
- You don't even want that.

04:48.259 --> 04:49.525
You said it smelled like death.

04:49.561 --> 04:51.227
I thought it did, but now...

04:52.786 --> 04:55.098
Smells like opportunity.

04:55.133 --> 04:56.432
- Ugh.
- Oh, God,

04:56.468 --> 04:58.635
it really does smell bad. My eyes hurt.

05:00.005 --> 05:00.970
Ahh.

05:01.006 --> 05:02.138
What are you looking all wistful about?

05:02.173 --> 05:04.540
Just thinking, about
relationships and love,

05:04.576 --> 05:07.143
and how I'm way better at
them than I thought I'd be.

05:07.178 --> 05:08.511
Should I do a TED Talk on it?

05:08.546 --> 05:10.213
Doesn't seem any dumber
than all the other TED Talks.

05:10.248 --> 05:13.116
I mean, Amy was a wreck and I fixed her.

05:13.151 --> 05:14.817
The weird thing is, I love her so much,

05:14.853 --> 05:16.119
I don't even feel like
bragging about it.

05:16.154 --> 05:17.320
- Clearly.
- You get it.

05:17.355 --> 05:19.355
All right, two things.
One, we're out of chips.

05:19.391 --> 05:20.923
- How?
- You skimped us.

05:20.959 --> 05:23.798
And two, Amy left and asked me
to give you this note.

05:24.596 --> 05:26.562
What's she say? She go out
to get us more chips?

05:26.598 --> 05:29.465
No, the practice test freaked her out.

05:29.501 --> 05:31.100
She's not taking the sergeant's exam.

05:31.136 --> 05:33.261
Damn it!

05:34.909 --> 05:37.041
- Amy's not in the break room.
- Or the evidence room.

05:37.067 --> 05:38.900
Or the ladies' bathroom.

05:38.935 --> 05:41.169
You know what? I'll check again.

05:41.504 --> 05:43.805
I've never seen him walk
with such purpose.

05:43.840 --> 05:44.939
What a wretched man.

05:44.974 --> 05:46.040
I can't believe this is happening.

05:46.076 --> 05:48.409
I didn't think there was any way
she could fail the practice test.

05:48.445 --> 05:50.344
Well, we still have three
hours until the exam.

05:50.380 --> 05:51.911
First we gotta figure out where she is.

05:51.937 --> 05:54.248
All right, think. if you were Amy,
where would you be right now?

05:54.284 --> 05:56.217
Oh, uh, boring pantsuit store.

05:56.252 --> 05:57.285
A crossword factory?

05:57.320 --> 05:59.520
A museum of retainers and headgear?

05:59.556 --> 06:01.589
Is it possible to enter the color beige?

06:01.624 --> 06:02.618
All right.

06:02.712 --> 06:04.692
Ooh, I know, I can call her
from Sarge's phone.

06:04.728 --> 06:07.676
There's no way she'll turn down
a call from a superior officer.

06:09.799 --> 06:11.032
Everybody shush!

06:11.067 --> 06:12.500
It's ringing, I can hear her phone.

06:12.535 --> 06:13.701
She's still in the building.

06:13.737 --> 06:14.969
She's still in the room!

06:16.039 --> 06:18.005
She's in...

06:18.074 --> 06:19.107
her desk drawer!

06:19.142 --> 06:20.742
Nope. It's just her purse.

06:20.777 --> 06:22.410
Phone must be in the purse.
That makes more sense.

06:22.445 --> 06:24.167
Phone, wallet, keys.

06:24.193 --> 06:25.513
She didn't take anything with her.

06:25.548 --> 06:27.682
That means she's still close. Let's go!

06:27.717 --> 06:31.953
Duty Sergeant said she
exited this way, and...

06:31.988 --> 06:34.055
she's not here. Damn it!

06:34.090 --> 06:35.590
Stop thinking about her
like she's your girlfriend.

06:35.625 --> 06:36.624
What would you do if she was a perp?

06:36.659 --> 06:39.227
I guess role play,
try and see the world through her eyes.

06:39.262 --> 06:42.396
Oh, no, what if I see my reflection
and fall in love with myself?

06:42.432 --> 06:44.632
Jake, we have a literal
ticking clock situation here.

06:44.667 --> 06:46.434
Roger that. Okay, fine, I'll be Amy.

06:46.469 --> 06:49.264
Just know everything I'm
about to say, I say with love.

06:51.074 --> 06:53.407
Okay. I'm outside.

06:53.443 --> 06:57.245
It's 78 degrees and yet
somehow I'm still cold.

06:57.313 --> 06:59.380
Better walk on the sunny
side of the street.

06:59.415 --> 07:01.449
Wait, did I remember
to put on sunscreen?

07:01.484 --> 07:02.717
Pause to think, pause to think.

07:02.752 --> 07:04.352
Yes, I did put on sunscreen,

07:04.387 --> 07:06.387
and I bragged about it all morning.

07:06.422 --> 07:08.022
Amy's on the move. And I'm walking,

07:08.057 --> 07:09.567
I'm walking.

07:09.759 --> 07:13.861
GP40 Diesel locomotive
with sprung drive wheels,

07:13.897 --> 07:17.600
rule 17 lighting, and
full underbody detailing.

07:17.834 --> 07:19.600
You're gonna be the belle of the ball.

07:19.636 --> 07:21.636
Terry is your god.

07:21.671 --> 07:25.173
All hail Lord Terry, giver of life.

07:25.208 --> 07:27.175
"All hail Lord Terry."

07:28.378 --> 07:29.844
Check out Jeffords Junction.

07:29.879 --> 07:32.013
It's got a ice cream shop, a '50s diner,

07:32.048 --> 07:34.081
and a Mexican restaurant
with a sombrero on it.

07:34.117 --> 07:35.983
What happens to the
sombrero when it rains?

07:36.019 --> 07:38.085
I see no drains. Does it
just fill up with water

07:38.121 --> 07:40.221
until the building collapses,
killing everyone inside?

07:40.256 --> 07:43.558
Fun fact: it never rains
at Jeffords Junction.

07:43.593 --> 07:46.360
So you achieved this level of
lushness through irrigation alone?

07:46.396 --> 07:47.829
I don't know.

07:47.864 --> 07:49.730
I'm just trying to build a fun world.

07:49.766 --> 07:52.400
That's what model trains are
all about: imagination.

07:52.435 --> 07:53.835
No, they're about accuracy.

07:53.870 --> 07:55.169
People like to see the world around them

07:55.205 --> 07:57.205
exactly as it is, but smaller.

07:57.240 --> 07:59.807
Okay, well, we can have
part of the model be

07:59.843 --> 08:02.577
very accurate and part
of it will be creative.

08:02.612 --> 08:03.578
I'm okay with that.

08:03.613 --> 08:05.413
Yes, yes, as am I.

08:05.448 --> 08:07.281
Would you fetch me
the 8 millimeter level

08:07.317 --> 08:08.216
from my office?

08:08.284 --> 08:09.565
Oh, sure.

08:18.194 --> 08:19.327
Oops.

08:19.362 --> 08:22.430
Gina! I just want to say,
I am disgusted by you.

08:22.465 --> 08:24.699
You somehow lucked your way
into a family heirloom,

08:24.734 --> 08:27.401
and have the gall to ask me
to give you $10,000 for it?

08:27.437 --> 08:29.003
That's an absurd amount of money!

08:29.038 --> 08:30.671
Took me all morning to get it together!

08:30.707 --> 08:32.173
Oh, I thought you were telling me off.

08:32.207 --> 08:34.174
And what would that get me? Pride?

08:34.210 --> 08:35.909
You can't make bread with pride.

08:35.945 --> 08:37.712
Well, unfortunately,
I've changed my mind.

08:37.746 --> 08:40.214
I want to keep the mother dough.
I'm gonna start baking.

08:40.250 --> 08:43.183
I see what you're doing.
You're trying to up the price.

08:43.219 --> 08:44.740
Well, shame on you.

08:44.954 --> 08:46.921
But also, here you go.

08:46.956 --> 08:48.723
An extra $2,000.

08:48.758 --> 08:51.040
You won't get one cent more...

08:51.594 --> 08:53.027
after this.

08:54.230 --> 08:56.664
Charles, get your chicken
leg off my desk.

08:56.699 --> 08:58.099
I don't want your money, Boyle.

08:58.134 --> 08:59.367
- What's going on?
- Nothing,

08:59.402 --> 09:03.738
I just realized that I just love
old, sour bread so much!

09:03.773 --> 09:05.306
- Come on, Gina.
- Fine!

09:05.341 --> 09:06.440
I put it under my desk

09:06.476 --> 09:09.143
and my space heater burnt it to a crisp.

09:11.214 --> 09:12.179
You're a murderer!

09:12.215 --> 09:13.314
Listen, you gotta get over it.

09:13.349 --> 09:14.682
It was just some old bread batter.

09:14.717 --> 09:16.017
It had black spots in it.

09:16.052 --> 09:17.618
Those are sour spores!

09:17.654 --> 09:19.320
That's where the tang comes from.

09:19.355 --> 09:20.888
That's tang town.

09:20.924 --> 09:22.290
I'm walking.

09:22.325 --> 09:25.927
I'm walking and I'm seeing
a paper supply store.

09:25.962 --> 09:28.062
I wonder if they have
those new summer folders?

09:28.097 --> 09:29.463
Whoa, you're good. I've
definitely heard her

09:29.499 --> 09:30.798
talk about those folders.

09:30.833 --> 09:32.800
That's because they have
such a fun color scheme,

09:32.835 --> 09:34.969
perfect for vacation organization.

09:35.004 --> 09:36.070
This is chilling.

09:36.105 --> 09:38.005
Darn it to heck.

09:38.041 --> 09:39.807
The store is closed.

09:39.842 --> 09:43.277
My bad day just got a whole
heck of a lot worse.

09:43.313 --> 09:45.713
Time to go... smoke in secret.

09:47.317 --> 09:49.917
And as I'm shame-smoking, I'm seeing...

09:51.955 --> 09:53.621
The library.

09:53.656 --> 09:56.624
Captain, did you throw away
my sombrero restaurant?

09:58.194 --> 10:01.562
Oh, I might have knocked it
in the bin by accident.

10:01.597 --> 10:04.310
I do remember saying, "Oops."

10:04.801 --> 10:06.033
Fine, I'll come clean.

10:06.069 --> 10:09.503
You're ruining our model
with your frivolous garbage.

10:09.539 --> 10:11.860
We're building this for kids!

10:12.442 --> 10:14.575
You really think they're gonna enjoy

10:14.610 --> 10:17.511
your brown rectangle of dirt
with one little house?

10:17.547 --> 10:19.246
Excuse me, this is an accurate facsimile

10:19.282 --> 10:20.748
of a mid-sized switching yard.

10:20.783 --> 10:22.183
And it isn't a "little house."

10:22.218 --> 10:24.051
It's a work shed where the yardmen get

10:24.087 --> 10:26.821
their OSHA-mandated eight hours
of rest between shifts.

10:26.856 --> 10:29.623
So, yeah, I think the kids
are gonna love it.

10:29.659 --> 10:33.127
Okay, we have a witness
coming in at 3:00 with her son.

10:33.162 --> 10:34.729
Let's split this train set in two,

10:34.764 --> 10:38.165
make our own models,
and see which one he likes more.

10:38.234 --> 10:39.266
You're on.

10:39.302 --> 10:40.968
You don't stand a chance.

10:41.004 --> 10:42.870
I'm gonna turn Jeffords Junction

10:42.905 --> 10:45.206
into the funnest town in America.

10:45.241 --> 10:47.708
That's right, I said "funnest."

10:49.212 --> 10:50.317
Stop dancing.

10:50.880 --> 10:52.913
Stop dancing.

10:54.217 --> 10:55.449
This is a direct order.

10:55.485 --> 10:56.740
Stop...

10:57.553 --> 10:58.783
dancing.

11:00.590 --> 11:02.723
Of course I know Amy Santiago.

11:02.759 --> 11:03.958
She was here earlier.

11:03.993 --> 11:06.193
She used my phone to call a car service.

11:06.229 --> 11:07.428
But she doesn't have her wallet.

11:07.463 --> 11:08.662
How's she gonna pay for that?

11:08.698 --> 11:10.097
We have a joint account
at Brooklyn Town Cars.

11:10.133 --> 11:11.098
I can call them, and they'll tell me

11:11.134 --> 11:12.366
where they dropped her off.

11:12.402 --> 11:13.834
She got out here.
I don't know where she went.

11:13.870 --> 11:14.969
That's it? You didn't watch her?

11:15.004 --> 11:16.804
You didn't follow her with your eyes?

11:16.839 --> 11:17.805
No, that would be creepy.

11:17.840 --> 11:19.940
Well, next time, do the city a favor

11:19.976 --> 11:22.009
and creep it up a little, bud!

11:22.045 --> 11:23.677
Let's think, where did she go next?

11:23.713 --> 11:25.312
Let's mix it up. This
time, you play Amy.

11:25.348 --> 11:26.414
She's in that building right there.

11:26.449 --> 11:27.581
Aww, you didn't do the voice.

11:27.617 --> 11:28.649
That's the Department of Records,

11:28.684 --> 11:30.451
where her best and only
friend Kylie works.

11:30.486 --> 11:32.453
Ah ha! "Noice."

11:32.488 --> 11:33.621
She signed in 20 minutes ago.

11:33.656 --> 11:36.187
Yet another great opportunity
for the voice.

11:36.726 --> 11:38.492
Amy's not here.

11:38.528 --> 11:40.191
Don't give up, babe, you'll find me.

11:40.217 --> 11:41.883
Not now, Rosa.

11:42.676 --> 11:45.081
Okay, so Amy's test is in an hour

11:45.107 --> 11:46.670
and we have no idea where she is.

11:46.696 --> 11:48.529
I'm spiraling. Somebody
say something positive.

11:48.564 --> 11:50.431
I cannot believe you
screwed this up for her.

11:50.466 --> 11:52.566
I was kind of hoping for something
more traditionally positive,

11:52.602 --> 11:54.168
as opposed to overtly negative.

11:54.203 --> 11:55.970
And I was hoping you wouldn't
lose my best friend.

11:56.005 --> 11:57.705
Starting to feel like you're
not a real big Jake head.

11:57.740 --> 12:01.125
Oh, no, I like him, just not
as a boyfriend for Amy.

12:01.151 --> 12:02.810
Or as a trivia teammate.

12:02.845 --> 12:05.312
Okay, Kylie, you have gotta
get over the trivia thing.

12:05.348 --> 12:06.781
I tried my hardest!

12:06.816 --> 12:08.978
The phrase you're looking for is,

12:09.152 --> 12:10.618
"Winter is coming."

12:10.653 --> 12:13.951
No, what Paul Revere said was
that the British are coming.

12:13.977 --> 12:15.956
- Come on.
- Yeah, come on.

12:15.992 --> 12:18.626
So what, Paul Revere never
said "winter is coming?"

12:18.661 --> 12:20.995
Not even in late autumn?
I still think I was right.

12:21.030 --> 12:22.196
Can we please get back to Amy?

12:22.231 --> 12:23.564
She signed in downstairs 20 minutes ago,

12:23.599 --> 12:25.032
but she didn't come here,
so where is she?

12:25.067 --> 12:26.867
Well, this is the Department of Records,

12:26.903 --> 12:28.169
so I'm going to make an educated guess

12:28.204 --> 12:29.637
and say she came here for a record.

12:29.672 --> 12:32.840
Ooh, not sure you're qualified
to make an <i>educated</i> guess.

12:32.875 --> 12:34.708
Okay, I know where
you're going with this,

12:34.744 --> 12:36.477
the Theory of Relativity question.

12:36.512 --> 12:39.647
Uh, he's got crazy hair,
super smart, Jewy name.

12:39.715 --> 12:41.263
Eisenberg! Jesse Eisenberg.

12:41.551 --> 12:43.017
Sit down!

12:44.320 --> 12:45.786
Look, I know lots of things.

12:45.822 --> 12:47.521
I know the names of every Transformer.

12:47.557 --> 12:50.591
Yeah, even the Dinobots. Grimlock much?

12:50.626 --> 12:52.126
- No.
- Okay.

12:52.161 --> 12:54.061
I'm not dumb, I just can't
handle the trivia pressure.

12:54.096 --> 12:56.030
Anyway, can you please
just look up every file

12:56.065 --> 12:57.598
that's been logged out
in the past 20 minutes?

12:57.633 --> 12:59.366
Fine, but I'm doing it
for her, not for you.

12:59.402 --> 13:00.701
Fine.

13:00.736 --> 13:02.803
Trivia Nazi over here.

13:02.839 --> 13:05.105
Yeah, there was a 99th
precinct case file

13:05.141 --> 13:07.808
from January, 2014,
that was just accessed.

13:07.844 --> 13:09.810
Okay, I definitely know where she is.

13:09.846 --> 13:11.946
Like you definitely knew
the Serengeti was

13:11.981 --> 13:13.247
a type of pasta?

13:13.282 --> 13:14.923
Let it go, Kylie!

13:15.384 --> 13:18.452
Mount Terry's looking good,
just add a little snow,

13:18.488 --> 13:20.421
and... perfect.

13:20.456 --> 13:22.523
Ah, yes. Now, that's what I call

13:22.558 --> 13:24.291
the right amount of arid shrubbery.

13:24.327 --> 13:25.459
Great job, Captain.

13:25.495 --> 13:26.861
That's just what the kid's gonna want,

13:26.896 --> 13:29.163
to play in a serial killer's
dumping ground.

13:29.198 --> 13:33.334
All aboard the Jeffords Victory Express!

13:33.369 --> 13:34.869
Oh, I'm sure the child
will love that you put

13:34.904 --> 13:37.660
a steam locomotive whistle
on a diesel train.

13:37.786 --> 13:40.454
I'm joking... he's going to
vomit when he hears that.

13:40.480 --> 13:41.947
- Kid's here.
- Show him in.

13:42.445 --> 13:43.450
This is Dylan.

13:43.476 --> 13:45.109
Hello, Dylan. I'm Captain Holt.

13:45.135 --> 13:46.701
We have some trains here to play with,

13:46.727 --> 13:49.483
like this one that carries
coal and rivets,

13:49.519 --> 13:51.018
the two main exports of our town.

13:51.053 --> 13:53.187
Would you like to transport
some coal or rivets?

13:53.222 --> 13:57.258
Or... would you like to come
over here to Jeffords Junction,

13:57.293 --> 14:00.394
where it's always all four
seasons and a volcano?

14:01.871 --> 14:03.771
Do you have guys have any video games?

14:03.797 --> 14:05.593
Okay, I see what's happening here.

14:05.931 --> 14:08.732
You're afraid that you're gonna
make Sergeant Jeffords feel bad.

14:08.830 --> 14:10.563
Don't worry, he's a subordinate.

14:10.589 --> 14:12.689
No, just... trains are kinda lame

14:12.715 --> 14:13.914
and nobody plays with them.

14:13.940 --> 14:17.074
Okay, but surely one of these trains

14:17.100 --> 14:19.667
is less lame than the other, right?

14:19.693 --> 14:22.318
No, they look exactly the same to me.

14:24.370 --> 14:25.469
Get out.

14:25.505 --> 14:26.971
Gina.

14:27.006 --> 14:28.873
I just got an email
from the council of cousins.

14:28.908 --> 14:30.574
Tina Boyle is contesting the will.

14:30.610 --> 14:31.642
- So?
- So he's coming here

14:31.677 --> 14:33.744
right now with an officer of the court.

14:33.780 --> 14:36.080
The mother dough is to be placed
in protective custody

14:36.115 --> 14:37.248
until the matter is resolved.

14:37.283 --> 14:39.316
Yeah, it's resolved. I cooked it.

14:39.352 --> 14:41.786
Don't you understand what will
happen if they find out?

14:41.821 --> 14:43.721
Gina, they will banish you
from the family.

14:43.756 --> 14:45.055
No more Boyle activities.

14:45.091 --> 14:46.957
No Christmas cards,
no Thanksgiving cards,

14:46.993 --> 14:48.359
no Valentine's cards.

14:48.394 --> 14:50.461
That's right, imagine a Valentine's Day

14:50.496 --> 14:51.862
with no cards from your cousins.

14:51.898 --> 14:54.432
Oh, my God. This is a dream come true.

14:54.467 --> 14:56.634
You think I can get out of all
the family vacations too?

14:56.669 --> 14:58.335
Because let's be honest, Charles,

14:58.371 --> 15:00.938
Aruba was the worst thing
that's ever happened.

15:00.973 --> 15:02.640
How do all 18 of you

15:02.675 --> 15:03.707
have sleep apnea?

15:07.013 --> 15:08.479
Listen, we have to do something.

15:08.514 --> 15:10.881
Maybe if we put the dough
in the box, they won't check.

15:10.917 --> 15:11.949
Won't check what?

15:11.984 --> 15:14.952
Christina! How are you?

15:14.987 --> 15:16.520
Great jacket. Where'd you get it?

15:16.556 --> 15:18.389
You know, I got it at Mervyn's.

15:18.424 --> 15:19.824
Where's my mother dough?

15:19.859 --> 15:22.693
Yeah, about that. Um, it's
an interesting story,

15:22.728 --> 15:23.761
what happened with
that thing, because...

15:23.796 --> 15:25.095
Yeah, it is interesting.

15:25.131 --> 15:26.230
- I killed her.
- No!

15:26.265 --> 15:27.531
- I killed her dead.
- No, she didn't.

15:27.567 --> 15:29.667
Put her by a space heater
till she was burnt up

15:29.702 --> 15:31.001
- to a black lump of coal.
- No, shh.

15:31.037 --> 15:32.069
Oh, my God.

15:32.104 --> 15:33.070
Yeah, that's right, she gone.

15:33.105 --> 15:35.372
First of all, Gina, I love you.

15:35.408 --> 15:37.208
Secondly, you're banished
from the family.

15:37.243 --> 15:38.676
Oh, no!

15:38.711 --> 15:41.345
May I still please be on the
Boyle daily email blast?

15:41.380 --> 15:42.947
- Please?
- I'm afraid not.

15:42.982 --> 15:44.849
You'll just get the weekly blasts,

15:44.884 --> 15:46.250
like the rest of our acquaintances.

15:46.285 --> 15:47.618
It was an accident, she didn't mean it.

15:47.653 --> 15:48.886
I'm sorry it had to end this way.

15:48.921 --> 15:50.287
Charles, I love you.

15:50.323 --> 15:51.355
I love you too.

15:51.390 --> 15:53.557
But you brought Gina into this family,
and you're also banished.

15:53.593 --> 15:54.692
What?

15:55.862 --> 15:57.728
Oh, there you are, thank God.

15:57.763 --> 15:59.396
Hey. How'd you find me?

15:59.432 --> 16:01.999
January 14th, 2014.

16:02.034 --> 16:04.401
Detectives Peralta and Santiago
conducted surveillance

16:04.437 --> 16:06.904
from a rooftop at 397 Barton Street.

16:06.939 --> 16:09.707
This is where we came
the night I won our bet

16:09.742 --> 16:11.408
and you fell in love with me.

16:11.444 --> 16:12.676
- Jake.
- The night that you flirted

16:12.712 --> 16:14.111
with me for 20 seconds and I became

16:14.146 --> 16:15.212
obsessed with you forever.

16:15.248 --> 16:16.380
Ready?

16:21.254 --> 16:23.153
I'm sorry I freaked out and ran away.

16:23.189 --> 16:24.288
It's okay.

16:24.323 --> 16:25.956
Just because you messed up
the practice test

16:25.992 --> 16:27.358
doesn't mean you're gonna
fail the real one.

16:27.393 --> 16:30.327
I didn't mess it up. I got 102%.

16:30.363 --> 16:31.962
I found a spelling error
in one question.

16:31.998 --> 16:33.494
I gave myself extra credit.

16:33.941 --> 16:35.374
Then why'd you leave?

16:35.400 --> 16:37.716
Because that was
the first time it really hit me.

16:38.104 --> 16:40.588
When I pass the exam,
I'll actually be a sergeant.

16:41.007 --> 16:44.362
And... what if everything
changes between us?

16:44.644 --> 16:46.143
That's why you came here?

16:46.178 --> 16:47.511
Yeah.

16:47.547 --> 16:49.380
Things are so good right now.

16:49.415 --> 16:50.548
I don't want to screw that up

16:50.583 --> 16:53.317
by getting transferred
or becoming your boss.

16:53.352 --> 16:56.587
Ames, I've always known
you were gonna be my boss.

16:56.622 --> 16:58.889
I mean, this is your dream,
from before we were dating.

16:58.925 --> 17:01.859
And yeah, things might change a little,
but for the better, right?

17:01.894 --> 17:03.627
We can finally get premium cable,

17:03.663 --> 17:05.194
check out all those shows on EPIX.

17:06.799 --> 17:08.933
Look, you can't be
afraid to be successful.

17:08.968 --> 17:10.800
You're too good for that.

17:10.836 --> 17:11.902
I love you.

17:11.938 --> 17:13.037
I love you too.

17:14.707 --> 17:16.006
Wait! The test.

17:16.041 --> 17:17.508
- We gotta get you outta here.
- Right.

17:17.542 --> 17:20.109
- I'm gonna be a sergeant.
- You're gonna be a sergeant!

17:22.982 --> 17:26.108
You don't have a key
for this random roof door, do you?

17:27.488 --> 17:29.533
Come on. Come on!

17:29.559 --> 17:30.791
Oh, no!

17:30.827 --> 17:32.326
I broke the hotel key
I forgot was in my wallet

17:32.362 --> 17:33.494
for the last five years.

17:33.530 --> 17:35.229
- Where's Rosa?
- We can't wait for her.

17:35.265 --> 17:36.364
The exam's in 20 minutes.

17:36.432 --> 17:38.132
It's my fault we're up here.

17:38.167 --> 17:39.534
I just won't take the test.

17:39.569 --> 17:41.536
I'll wait three years for the next one.

17:41.571 --> 17:42.670
Oh, no, you won't.

17:43.706 --> 17:44.805
No. Jake,

17:44.841 --> 17:46.707
you are not Die-Harding off this roof.

17:46.743 --> 17:48.476
I am definitely Die-Harding
off this roof,

17:48.511 --> 17:50.444
for you and only for you,
and also for me

17:50.480 --> 17:52.380
'cause I've always wanted to do it.

17:53.416 --> 17:54.749
Jake, come on, get down from there.

17:54.784 --> 17:56.017
It's too dangerous.

17:56.052 --> 17:58.286
It's perfectly safe.

17:58.321 --> 17:59.387
See you in hell, kiddo.

17:59.422 --> 18:00.354
What?

18:01.457 --> 18:02.456
Yippee ki-yay!

18:02.492 --> 18:03.991
Bars, bars, bars!

18:04.027 --> 18:06.060
Oh! Are there bars on the window?

18:06.095 --> 18:08.286
Yeah, there bars on the window.

18:08.798 --> 18:10.765
I just set up a video game system.

18:10.800 --> 18:12.176
The kid's much happier.

18:12.368 --> 18:14.535
Turns out children don't
care about model trains.

18:14.571 --> 18:15.570
Not only children.

18:15.605 --> 18:17.672
I'm beginning to think nobody does.

18:17.707 --> 18:19.106
Kevin, you are not gonna believe this.

18:19.142 --> 18:21.442
Terry put Lo-V IRT Pullman rolling stock

18:21.477 --> 18:22.877
on a ballastless track.

18:22.912 --> 18:25.046
I was dying, Kevin, dying.

18:25.081 --> 18:26.347
Yes, you can hang up now.

18:26.382 --> 18:27.915
I guess we're condemned...

18:27.951 --> 18:30.151
to a life of solo railroading.

18:30.186 --> 18:31.580
We don't have to be.

18:31.821 --> 18:33.454
I know we've had our differences,

18:33.489 --> 18:37.158
but through some crazy twist
of fate we found each other.

18:37.193 --> 18:38.759
Shouldn't we just be excited

18:38.795 --> 18:40.995
that we have someone to share that with?

18:44.867 --> 18:46.467
Not interested. Good day.

18:46.502 --> 18:49.236
Okay. Well, I just wanted to show you

18:49.272 --> 18:51.806
I got a tiny little train inspector.

18:51.841 --> 18:54.342
It's to make sure
the tracks were up to code.

18:55.845 --> 18:56.811
I'll be going.

18:59.215 --> 19:00.214
Wait.

19:01.818 --> 19:03.351
You left your figurine behind
for some reason.

19:03.386 --> 19:04.385
Take it.

19:07.678 --> 19:09.095
Wait.

19:09.826 --> 19:11.859
Come on, Sergeant, take the
train through the pass.

19:11.894 --> 19:13.995
All aboard the Terryliner.

19:14.030 --> 19:16.397
Next stop, Holtsovania.

19:17.467 --> 19:18.907
Where are you guys?

19:19.669 --> 19:21.548
What the hell is taking you so long?

19:22.538 --> 19:23.871
Did Jake Die-Hard off the roof?

19:23.906 --> 19:25.406
- Yeah.
- But the windows have bars.

19:25.441 --> 19:28.009
Yeah, we all know about the bars, Rosa!

19:28.044 --> 19:30.011
All right, you get to the exam,
I'll take care of Jake.

19:30.046 --> 19:31.278
Yeah, don't worry about me.

19:31.314 --> 19:33.314
The important thing is,
you go become a sergeant.

19:33.349 --> 19:35.082
Leave me! I know it's gonna be hard

19:35.118 --> 19:37.018
to walk away, but you have to be strong!

19:37.053 --> 19:39.186
She left like two minutes ago.
You're talking to nobody.

19:39.222 --> 19:40.521
Yeah, that makes sense.

19:40.556 --> 19:42.390
This is when the Boyles
went to that farm

19:42.425 --> 19:44.674
and we all got hoof and mouth disease.

19:45.094 --> 19:47.094
Ah, when we went to that water park,

19:47.130 --> 19:49.163
and we all got hoof and
mouth disease again.

19:49.232 --> 19:50.765
That was a good vacation.

19:50.800 --> 19:53.100
Sam, Tina, what are you doing here?

19:53.136 --> 19:54.101
Gina called us.

19:54.137 --> 19:55.302
What? Why?

19:55.338 --> 19:57.104
Because I wanted to show you this.

19:57.140 --> 19:58.239
It's a new mother dough.

19:58.274 --> 20:00.675
Now, I know it's not 140 years old,

20:00.710 --> 20:03.544
but I will feed it,
and I will nurture it,

20:03.579 --> 20:06.347
and it will grow, and
eventually it'll be

20:06.382 --> 20:09.950
just as sour and smelly as the old one.

20:09.986 --> 20:11.185
What about the tang?

20:11.220 --> 20:13.320
- It will be tang town.
- Tang town.

20:13.356 --> 20:15.790
Now can you just let Charles
back into the family, please?

20:15.825 --> 20:17.358
How will we get to
this new mother dough?

20:17.393 --> 20:19.293
You can all come by my apartment

20:19.328 --> 20:21.128
and take a little piece
whenever you want.

20:21.164 --> 20:22.897
- We'll need keys.
- Why?

20:22.932 --> 20:24.665
In case you're not home, or in the bath.

20:24.701 --> 20:26.567
Gina, it's okay, you
don't have to do this.

20:26.602 --> 20:28.736
Yes, I do, because you're my brother.

20:30.206 --> 20:32.473
Isn't she great? We used
to have sex, you know.

20:32.508 --> 20:33.841
Cool.

20:33.876 --> 20:36.444
You don't have to mention
that every time, you idiot.

20:37.480 --> 20:38.746
Hey.

20:38.781 --> 20:40.414
Hey! That looks like the strut

20:40.450 --> 20:42.283
of a lady who just crushed an exam.

20:42.351 --> 20:45.019
I sure did,
and finished 45 minutes early.

20:45.054 --> 20:46.620
Oh, nice, did everyone else
give you dirty looks?

20:46.656 --> 20:48.355
So dirty.

20:48.391 --> 20:49.757
How long were you hanging
off the roof for?

20:49.792 --> 20:51.959
Long enough for me to
take a bunch of pics.

20:51.994 --> 20:53.794
Ah-ha, very funny. No "soc."

20:53.830 --> 20:55.096
Listen.

20:55.131 --> 20:56.797
I just want to thank you guys

20:56.833 --> 20:58.899
for chasing me down and getting me here.

20:58.935 --> 21:00.201
I know it's been a rough day, Jake,

21:00.236 --> 21:02.336
but I think I know how
to make it up to you.

21:02.371 --> 21:03.671
Three minutes?

21:03.706 --> 21:05.673
Oh, no, not that. Even better.

21:05.708 --> 21:07.975
Okay, welcome to trivia night.

21:08.010 --> 21:09.543
You said you would
never bring him again.

21:09.579 --> 21:11.045
Don't worry, it's gonna be fine,

21:11.080 --> 21:12.379
- I promise.
- Is it?

21:12.415 --> 21:14.749
Tonight's first category,
by special request,

21:14.784 --> 21:16.317
the "Transformers" movies.

21:16.352 --> 21:17.485
Yes!

21:17.520 --> 21:19.086
Question one. What is the name

21:19.122 --> 21:21.722
of the evil race of Transformers?

21:21.758 --> 21:25.126
The robot... bad robot.
Oh, God, I don't know.

21:25.161 --> 21:26.527
- Damn it, Jake!
- I'm sorry,

21:26.562 --> 21:28.195
I can't take the trivia "presh"!

21:28.231 --> 21:30.064
Why couldn't you have just
given me the three minutes?
