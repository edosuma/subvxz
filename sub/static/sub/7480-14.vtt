(blows landing, Callen grunts)

00:19.219 --> 00:20.917
Finish him.

(panting)

00:30.221 --> 00:31.823
(gun hammer cocks)

00:31.904 --> 00:33.773

He's back.

01:16.303 --> 01:17.538
(laughs)

01:17.605 --> 01:20.442
You're a funny guy.

01:20.509 --> 01:23.745
Vintage reserve. 2007.

01:23.813 --> 01:26.250
'07 was an exceptional year.

01:26.317 --> 01:28.419
Not quite 2002, but...

01:28.486 --> 01:30.087
definitely a good one.

01:30.088 --> 01:32.258
I'm gonna take your word for it.
I am not a champagne guy.

01:32.325 --> 01:33.860
No.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.194
You are not.

01:35.262 --> 01:38.132
However...

01:38.200 --> 01:40.134
Boom!

01:40.201 --> 01:45.172
Trappist monks only make
213 cases of this beer a year.

01:47.510 --> 01:49.612
- You know someone in Belgium?
- Before I got stuck with you,

01:49.679 --> 01:51.557
Sam Hanna was
an international brand.

01:51.582 --> 01:52.715
Oh...

01:52.716 --> 01:54.384
You know, before I
got stuck with you,

01:54.451 --> 01:56.252
I didn't realize that people
who refer to themselves

01:56.320 --> 01:57.845
in the third person
really existed in life.

01:57.846 --> 02:00.213
Yeah, right.
Kind of like guys who have

02:00.457 --> 02:02.325
one letter of the alphabet
for a first name.

02:03.360 --> 02:05.027
Five years to the day.

02:05.095 --> 02:06.595
Partners.

02:07.864 --> 02:09.197
Oh, look out.

02:09.264 --> 02:12.401
I think we got a, uh, stage-four
bromance on our hands, here.

02:12.468 --> 02:13.568
Will they, or won't they?

02:13.636 --> 02:14.903
You hear people
talking right now?

02:14.971 --> 02:16.905
Only people I hear talking are
people who have been partners

02:16.972 --> 02:18.606
for more than five years.
(gasps)

02:18.674 --> 02:21.375
Oh, snap!
Oh, ouch!

02:21.443 --> 02:23.511
I get that.

02:23.579 --> 02:26.849
So how was it, huh?
That first case?

02:26.916 --> 02:29.051
Complicated.

02:29.119 --> 02:31.020
It was the best takedown ever.

02:31.088 --> 02:32.923
We breached a safe house,
what, six hours

02:32.990 --> 02:34.892
after meeting each other
for the first time?

02:34.959 --> 02:37.562
Terror suspect inside
surrounded by multiple hostiles.

02:37.629 --> 02:39.197
Reinforced steel
doors at every entry.

02:39.265 --> 02:41.633
Yeah, we rigged mini-chargers
on the back door's hinges.

02:41.700 --> 02:43.134
Door blew straight
in on a sentry.

02:43.202 --> 02:44.169
Knocked him out clean.

02:44.237 --> 02:45.838
So I stepped in,
cleared the room.

02:45.905 --> 02:48.407
Actually, I went
in first.

02:49.409 --> 02:50.777
No... it was me.

02:50.845 --> 02:53.113
I took point,
I cleared the room.

02:53.181 --> 02:54.882
I always take
point when it's

02:54.950 --> 02:56.651
a heavy breach
like that. Always.

02:56.719 --> 03:00.188
On every op since then,
yes. Not that one.

03:00.256 --> 03:01.456
Maybe you just went in

03:01.524 --> 03:03.893
at the exact
same time... together.

03:07.331 --> 03:09.466
You're right, Sam.

03:12.370 --> 03:15.573
You're humoring me?
Me, humor you?

03:15.640 --> 03:17.041
I-I don't have a problem
with conflict,

03:17.108 --> 03:18.822
as long as it leads to
a discovery of truth.

03:18.823 --> 03:19.825
Not a conflict.

03:19.826 --> 03:22.295
It's a discussion over who
entered a room first.

03:22.348 --> 03:23.581
That's all.

03:25.651 --> 03:29.420
Five years, never humored you.

03:29.488 --> 03:30.388
Enjoy your champagne.

03:30.456 --> 03:32.657
Okay.

03:32.725 --> 03:36.461
A new case awaits you upstairs.

03:36.529 --> 03:38.863
And gentlemen,
happy anniversary.

03:43.235 --> 03:47.105
I hear today marks the fifth
year of a certain partnership.

03:47.173 --> 03:49.508
They're actually not
talking to each other.

03:49.575 --> 03:52.878
Someone started
humoring someone else.

03:52.946 --> 03:54.947
Things deteriorated.

03:55.015 --> 03:57.283
Ooh... Sam hates it
when Callen does that.

03:57.351 --> 03:58.752
Hold on.

03:58.819 --> 04:01.121
Kensi and Deeks are
psychoanalyzing Callen and Sam?

04:01.188 --> 04:05.091
Irony, thy
name is... this.

04:05.159 --> 04:07.861
The new case.
Let's hear it.

04:07.929 --> 04:09.763
Well, it's slathered
in all sorts of sensitive.

04:09.831 --> 04:12.099
A Diplomatic Security Service
van was attacked

04:12.167 --> 04:14.268
just outside LAX
about 20 minutes ago.

04:14.335 --> 04:16.137
So we're looking at a hijacking.
This van was headed

04:16.204 --> 04:18.805
for a warehouse facility
downtown when it was hit

04:18.874 --> 04:21.108
beneath a freeway underpass.

04:21.176 --> 04:23.977
Smack-dab in a traffic
cam blind spot.

04:24.045 --> 04:25.545
The State Department
uses DSS couriers

04:25.613 --> 04:28.782
to transport diplomatic pouches
across borders.

04:28.850 --> 04:30.050
FedEx for the embassy set.

04:30.118 --> 04:32.519
Diplomats can put anything
they want in a pouch.

04:32.587 --> 04:34.355
Customs officials
can't search it.

04:34.422 --> 04:38.425
In this case, the "diplomatic
pouch" was a crate.

04:38.493 --> 04:42.563
32 inches by 32 inches by 45
inches, weighing 150 pounds.

04:42.631 --> 04:43.765
The crate was assigned

04:43.832 --> 04:45.900
pouch status at its origin
back in India.

04:45.968 --> 04:48.603
It was picked up by two DSS
couriers who escorted it

04:48.671 --> 04:51.640
all the way here
until it came under fire.

04:51.708 --> 04:54.277
L.A. was the crate's
final destination.

04:54.344 --> 04:55.879
What was in it?
We're still in the process

04:55.946 --> 04:57.347
of trying to find out.

04:57.415 --> 05:00.217
The State Department takes its
pouch policy very seriously.

05:00.285 --> 05:01.652
What do we know
about the couriers?

05:01.720 --> 05:03.621
Diane Dunross
and Roger Clark.

05:03.689 --> 05:06.491
Both personnel records
are spotless.

05:06.558 --> 05:07.425
How long have they
worked together?

05:07.493 --> 05:09.494
Ten years.

05:13.733 --> 05:16.635
The couriers are still
at the crime scene.

05:16.703 --> 05:18.504
We're dealing with
the State Department,

05:18.572 --> 05:20.239
so let's tread carefully.

05:20.307 --> 05:24.443
Is Assistant Director Granger
somehow involved in this case?

05:24.510 --> 05:27.379
He's, uh, taken an interest.

05:27.447 --> 05:29.348
And?

05:29.415 --> 05:34.152
And... keep me apprised,
Mr. Callen.

05:36.488 --> 05:39.256
DETECTIVE: <i>The hijackers shot up</i>
<i>the van pretty good.</i>

05:39.324 --> 05:40.791
Lucky for those couriers,

05:40.859 --> 05:42.793
the State Department
bulletproofs their vehicles.

05:42.861 --> 05:44.495
SAM:
Where are they now?

05:44.562 --> 05:46.897
DETECTIVE: Sedan with diplomatic plates
picked them up ten minutes ago.

05:49.501 --> 05:50.434
(phone line rings)

05:50.501 --> 05:51.669
ERIC:
Hey, what do you got?

05:51.737 --> 05:53.170
Eric, the couriers
left the scene before

05:53.238 --> 05:54.906
we could talk to them.
They're in a diplomatic vehicle.

05:54.973 --> 05:56.374
All right.
Checking the area now.

05:56.442 --> 05:58.376
(computer beeps)

05:58.444 --> 06:01.846
Okay. I got a GPS locator
assigned to

06:01.914 --> 06:03.782
a State Department sedan.
Looks like they're headed

06:03.850 --> 06:05.417
for the Federal
Building in Westwood.

06:05.485 --> 06:06.585
Got it.

06:06.653 --> 06:08.720
They wouldn't have
left here without a reason.

06:08.788 --> 06:11.156
It better be a good one.

06:11.224 --> 06:12.925
Okay. So skid marks indicate

06:12.992 --> 06:15.694
the vehicle came to a sudden
stop, jammed in the van.

06:15.762 --> 06:16.829
Another vehicle came from

06:16.896 --> 06:18.263
the opposite direction,
corralled them in.

06:18.331 --> 06:19.364
You had no escape.

06:19.432 --> 06:20.966
Lots more shell casings
over here.

06:21.034 --> 06:22.668
The couriers are
on their way to Westwood.

06:22.735 --> 06:24.603
We're going after them.
Okay.

06:24.671 --> 06:27.372
Tire tracks are also wider than
normal. Probably a truck.

06:27.440 --> 06:28.507
That's a heavy crate.

06:28.575 --> 06:30.709
They probably knew what
they were after.

06:30.777 --> 06:34.045
Hang on. There's bullet holes on
that side, but not on that side.

06:34.113 --> 06:35.914
Door was open as
they were taking fire

06:35.981 --> 06:37.848
from the front of the van.
- Aren't DSS couriers trained

06:37.916 --> 06:40.217
to stay inside the vehicle
if they're attacked?

06:40.285 --> 06:41.953
Yeah, they are.

06:42.021 --> 06:44.989
Passenger didn't. Why?

06:48.494 --> 06:50.061
WOMAN:
Right in here.

06:52.231 --> 06:53.197
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

06:53.265 --> 06:55.299
Diane Dunross
and Roger Clark?

06:55.367 --> 06:56.834
Callen and Hanna...

06:56.902 --> 07:00.104
Our boss called to say
NCIS was on its way.

07:00.172 --> 07:01.672
Why'd you leave
the crime scene?

07:01.740 --> 07:03.607
(laughs) You're nothing
if not direct.

07:03.674 --> 07:05.542
What did I say we'd do when
these guys caught up with us?

07:05.610 --> 07:08.378
Um, offer them a martini
and play nice.

07:08.445 --> 07:10.647
Well, they're not
the martini type.

07:10.714 --> 07:12.315
How about you just
answer the question?

07:12.382 --> 07:14.516
We were following orders.

07:14.584 --> 07:17.152
Whose orders?
My orders.

07:17.220 --> 07:18.587
I'm Ed Gornt,

07:18.654 --> 07:21.856
Regional Supervising Agent,
Diplomatic Security Service.

07:21.924 --> 07:26.194
DSS. I understand that NCIS
is investigating this case,

07:26.262 --> 07:29.131
but I wanted to debrief
my people first.

07:29.199 --> 07:31.700
Gotta catch a flight
for DC in an hour.

07:32.703 --> 07:34.504
Which one of you broke protocol

07:34.572 --> 07:35.872
and left the van
during the attack?

07:35.940 --> 07:39.242
We're all on the same
side here.

07:39.310 --> 07:41.511
I did. I, um...

07:41.579 --> 07:43.046
I thought that
I could stop it.

07:43.113 --> 07:44.780
I got carried away.

07:44.848 --> 07:46.749
Diane's courage got the better
of her judgment.

07:46.817 --> 07:48.851
It's as much my fault
as it was hers.

07:48.919 --> 07:50.553
SAM:
You get a look at the hijackers?

07:50.620 --> 07:52.688
Four men, ski masks,

07:52.755 --> 07:54.289
pickup truck forced
us off the road--

07:54.357 --> 07:55.991
a blue Ford F-150.

07:56.058 --> 07:59.060
A black Jeep
boxed us in.

07:59.128 --> 08:00.495
While two guys kept us pinned
down with gunfire,

08:00.562 --> 08:03.531
the other two blew the van
doors, took the crate.

08:03.599 --> 08:05.433
Would have been nice if we had
known this earlier.

08:05.501 --> 08:07.235
(phone line rings)
ERIC: Sam? What you need?

08:07.303 --> 08:08.536
SAM:
Eric... we're looking for

08:08.604 --> 08:12.174
two vehicles fleeing the crime
scene, a blue Ford F-150

08:12.241 --> 08:14.110
and a, uh, black Jeep.

08:14.177 --> 08:15.745
The F-150's a priority.

08:15.812 --> 08:17.246
It's transporting the DSS crate.

08:17.314 --> 08:18.748
Okay. I'm on it.

08:18.816 --> 08:21.217
Sam, just got off the phone
with the State Department.

08:21.285 --> 08:22.586
About that crate...

08:22.653 --> 08:25.322
it was filled with old invoices
scheduled to be destroyed.

08:25.389 --> 08:27.890
All right, thanks.

08:27.958 --> 08:30.026
Got some interesting news
about your DSS crate.

08:30.093 --> 08:33.162
You found it?
Wasn't worth stealing.

08:33.230 --> 08:34.530
According to the State
Department,

08:34.597 --> 08:36.131
it was loaded
with outdated invoices,

08:36.198 --> 08:39.100
headed to the shredder,
nonclassified,

08:39.168 --> 08:40.934
no security value.

08:41.003 --> 08:43.671
I'm guessing the State
Department got that wrong, Sam.

08:43.738 --> 08:44.905
I'm guessing the same thing.

08:44.973 --> 08:47.708
Gentlemen, I'm handing this case
over to you.

08:47.776 --> 08:50.677
Capitol Hill beckons.

08:50.745 --> 08:53.280
I expect full cooperation.

08:59.955 --> 09:03.557
So... why don't you tell us what
was really in the crate?

09:13.422 --> 09:15.356
CLARK:
Like we said, couriers aren't

09:15.424 --> 09:17.159
told the contents
of diplomatic shipments.

09:17.236 --> 09:18.870
State Department policy.

09:18.937 --> 09:21.306
All we do is get things
from Point A to Point B.

09:21.374 --> 09:23.108
So to answer your question,

09:23.176 --> 09:26.211
we have no idea
what was in the crate.

09:26.279 --> 09:27.546
NCIS protocol.

09:27.614 --> 09:31.283
All weapons on the premises
need to be secured.

09:32.752 --> 09:34.686
(laughs)

09:34.754 --> 09:36.554
Your house, your rules.

09:48.700 --> 09:51.836
Well, you know, a girl's
gotta protect herself.

09:53.038 --> 09:54.973
Yeah, I'm loads of fun
on a first date.

09:55.040 --> 09:57.041
Not that I have much
time for them.

09:57.109 --> 10:00.311
Been a DSS courier
since I was 25.

10:00.379 --> 10:02.180
Forget about dating
in our business.

10:02.248 --> 10:04.183
I joined DSS
after leaving the Army.

10:04.250 --> 10:07.386
Starting a family before I hit
the nursing home would be nice.

10:07.454 --> 10:08.888
You can tell us now.

10:10.124 --> 10:11.390
Tell you what?

10:11.458 --> 10:13.492
What you were holding
back in front of your boss

10:13.560 --> 10:14.760
at the Fed Building.

10:18.364 --> 10:21.733
First thing you need to know
is we were following orders.

10:23.135 --> 10:25.569
Our job is to get diplomatic
packages to their destinations

10:25.637 --> 10:26.870
and not ask any questions.

10:26.938 --> 10:29.906
Okay. So let's
talk chain of title.

10:29.974 --> 10:32.209
CALLEN: The cargo shipment had
to start somewhere.

10:32.276 --> 10:34.678
Gornt. He gave
us the assignment.

10:34.746 --> 10:37.681
The crate was waiting for us
at the U.S. Embassy in Mumbai.

10:37.749 --> 10:39.984
Gornt's orders
were to escort it to L.A.

10:40.052 --> 10:41.352
He has the power to generate

10:41.420 --> 10:43.722
the diplomatic paperwork
necessary for a pouch delivery.

10:43.789 --> 10:45.057
We don't.

10:45.125 --> 10:46.158
You trust him?

10:46.226 --> 10:48.394
Only person I trust
is my partner.

10:49.429 --> 10:51.898
So, why should Sam
and I trust you?

10:51.965 --> 10:53.499
Callen, Sam,

10:53.567 --> 10:56.335
we located the hijackers'
blue Ford F150 pickup.

10:56.403 --> 10:58.604
It was abandoned half a
mile from the crime scene.

10:58.672 --> 11:01.607
Originally reported
stolen a week ago.

11:01.675 --> 11:04.543
Look, we just want to get
the crate back, okay?

11:04.611 --> 11:07.246
Then you're going to have
to play by our rules.

11:07.314 --> 11:08.447
Meaning?

11:08.515 --> 11:10.549
Meaning, you only tell your boss

11:10.617 --> 11:12.151
what we need him to know.

11:16.423 --> 11:18.691
Okay.

11:18.758 --> 11:20.525
We have nothing

11:20.593 --> 11:22.027
to hide.

11:22.095 --> 11:23.662
NELL:
Bad news, guys.

11:23.730 --> 11:25.598
Gornt's flight to
DC just departed.

11:25.665 --> 11:28.033
Can't get to him till it
lands five hours from now.

11:29.069 --> 11:31.256
SAM: You got
nothing to hide?

11:31.257 --> 11:32.257
Good.

11:32.325 --> 11:33.659
We just pulled Gornt
off a flight.

11:33.727 --> 11:35.325
He's on his way here now.

11:35.326 --> 11:36.551
So you've got about
20 minutes to tell us

11:36.576 --> 11:37.776
everything you know about him.

11:37.998 --> 11:39.665
Got it?
Yeah, thanks, Kens.

11:39.732 --> 11:40.966
Okay.
Okay.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.835
Hijackers wiped the
pickup truck clean.

11:42.902 --> 11:44.036
No prints.

11:44.104 --> 11:46.805
Fortunately, I have
yet to find the bad guys

11:46.873 --> 11:49.808
who can wipe traffic
cam footage as easily.

11:54.614 --> 11:56.682
And bingo, ten minutes
after the hijacking.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.551
You got a logo

11:58.619 --> 12:00.553
on that van?

12:00.620 --> 12:02.755
The Malibu Springs

12:02.823 --> 12:04.790
Winery.

12:05.826 --> 12:08.727
It's a real winery.

12:08.795 --> 12:10.562
Looks legit at first glance.

12:11.281 --> 12:13.082
Let's try some facial
rec on our thieves.

12:13.149 --> 12:14.383
Right.

12:16.519 --> 12:18.152
This could take some time.

12:18.220 --> 12:20.554
(beeps)
Oh, got a hit.

12:20.622 --> 12:22.523
Let's see...

12:22.591 --> 12:23.824
Well, criminal
records in Mexico.

12:23.892 --> 12:24.858
Muscle

12:24.926 --> 12:26.159
for the Peña Cartel.

12:26.227 --> 12:29.796
Huh, looks like the cartel set
them up with new identities.

12:29.864 --> 12:32.632
They've been living the American
dream as inventory staff

12:32.700 --> 12:35.368
at the Malibu Springs Winery
for the past month.

12:35.435 --> 12:39.372
Callen, Sam, looks like we've
got a Peña Cartel connection.

12:39.439 --> 12:41.974
We got to check in with ops.

12:42.042 --> 12:44.043
Excuse us for a moment.

12:49.951 --> 12:51.117
Fire it up, Eric.

12:52.754 --> 12:55.121
Lights, camera, action.

12:55.189 --> 12:57.591
They're playing us
against Gornt.

12:57.658 --> 13:00.460
They're just doing their jobs.

13:05.065 --> 13:06.566
DUNROSS:
You're right.

13:06.634 --> 13:08.302
The important thing
is finding out

13:08.369 --> 13:09.836
what happened
to that damn crate.

13:09.904 --> 13:11.204
Gotcha.

13:13.207 --> 13:16.442
"You think Gornt's dirty?"

13:16.510 --> 13:18.811
Well, we've never lost
a package, and now this.

13:20.080 --> 13:24.283
"If it's not Gornt,

13:24.350 --> 13:26.318
"then...

13:27.520 --> 13:30.522
"If it's not Gornt,
then who is it?"

13:30.590 --> 13:32.124
DUNROSS: Yeah, they're just
doing what we would do.

13:32.192 --> 13:33.659
They sort of remind me of us.

13:33.726 --> 13:36.195
They do remind me
of us, actually.

13:36.263 --> 13:38.264
Without the wit, charm,

13:38.331 --> 13:41.468
sophistication, or good looks.

13:41.535 --> 13:43.203
"Does NCIS

13:43.271 --> 13:45.705
think we're involved?"

13:47.209 --> 13:48.742
"You need to be careful."

13:50.378 --> 13:52.546
Here we go...

13:52.613 --> 13:53.747
"Malta."

13:56.617 --> 13:58.351
Loyalty's all that matters.

13:59.787 --> 14:00.853
Eric, Nell, did you get that?

14:00.921 --> 14:01.954
NELL:
Yeah, got it, Callen.

14:02.022 --> 14:04.089
Cross-referencing
all mentions of "Malta"

14:04.157 --> 14:06.558
and the files of Diane Dunross
and Roger Clark right now.

14:06.626 --> 14:10.061
Okay, just located
the Malibu Springs Winery van.

14:10.129 --> 14:13.165
It's parked right
outside the winery.

14:13.233 --> 14:15.234
Send Kensi and Deeks.

14:17.738 --> 14:19.439
Gornt back yet?

14:19.507 --> 14:22.409
April, 2011 was a big
month for you, Roger.

14:22.477 --> 14:24.379
You attended a U.S.
embassy party in Malta.

14:24.446 --> 14:26.247
And you met a woman,

14:26.315 --> 14:28.917
Annika Cassar.

14:28.985 --> 14:31.587
You've used every available
vacation day since then to go back.

14:31.655 --> 14:33.856
Are you in love?

14:33.923 --> 14:35.257
Why the hell does that matter?

14:35.325 --> 14:36.492
The Peña Cartel

14:36.560 --> 14:37.560
stole your crate.

14:37.628 --> 14:39.562
Cartel involvement means

14:39.630 --> 14:41.531
big money; they
pay top dollar

14:41.598 --> 14:42.999
to smuggle merchandise
across the border.

14:43.067 --> 14:45.167
You think we were smuggling
for the Peña Cartel?

14:45.235 --> 14:48.003
You don't have the access,
but your boss Gornt does.

14:48.071 --> 14:50.272
Thing is, he needed
someone on the ground

14:50.340 --> 14:51.941
to get the crate to the cartel.

14:52.009 --> 14:53.409
Someone with motivation.

14:53.477 --> 14:54.777
Motivation to turn traitor?

14:54.845 --> 14:57.213
I've served this country
my entire life.

14:57.281 --> 14:59.348
- Why would I throw that away?
- Roger, they're baiting us; don't.

14:59.416 --> 15:02.552
Because you're on the road
365 days a year.

15:02.620 --> 15:04.721
Because you gave your
entire life to this country.

15:04.789 --> 15:06.123
Because you want
to start a family

15:06.190 --> 15:07.357
before you hit
the nursing home.

15:07.425 --> 15:09.926
What's in that crate?

15:09.994 --> 15:11.261
Something to set up

15:11.328 --> 15:12.762
a nice, comfy
retirement for you

15:12.830 --> 15:15.531
and your little
girl from Malta?

15:15.599 --> 15:17.032
Don't move.

15:17.100 --> 15:19.135
We didn't do this!

15:21.004 --> 15:23.338
Split them up.

15:24.540 --> 15:27.475
SAM:
You-- this way.

15:27.543 --> 15:29.644
CALLEN:
Let's go.

15:29.712 --> 15:32.280
In here.

15:34.350 --> 15:35.984
KENSI:
That's our van.

15:37.687 --> 15:39.755
DEEKS:
Let's take a look around.

15:48.800 --> 15:51.301
Okay, the serial
number on the box is

15:51.369 --> 15:53.570
244932.

15:53.638 --> 15:56.673
KENSI:
244932? Let's find it fast.

15:56.741 --> 15:58.575
Am I the only one
having flashbacks

15:58.642 --> 16:00.410
to <i>Raiders Of The Lost Ark?</i>

16:00.477 --> 16:01.511
What do you mean?

16:01.578 --> 16:04.346
The end of the movie,
the last scene.

16:04.414 --> 16:06.148
They wheel in the Lost Ark

16:06.216 --> 16:08.083
to this giant
warehouse, and...

16:08.151 --> 16:09.251
Wait a minute.

16:09.319 --> 16:10.652
Have you not seen the movie?

16:10.720 --> 16:11.954
I've seen it.

16:12.022 --> 16:14.257
You're a liar.

16:14.325 --> 16:15.625
Why would I lie?
Okay,

16:15.693 --> 16:18.695
how does the movie begin?

16:18.763 --> 16:19.629
I forget.

16:20.765 --> 16:22.366
Okay, I haven't seen it.

16:22.434 --> 16:23.801
So what? Big deal.

16:23.869 --> 16:26.972
Well, you really were raised
by wolves, weren't you?

16:30.843 --> 16:32.410
Found it.

16:47.025 --> 16:49.226
Got it?

16:57.068 --> 16:58.335
Oh.

16:58.402 --> 17:00.504
DEEKS:
Wow.

17:02.974 --> 17:04.007
(gunshots)

17:04.075 --> 17:05.175
I think we just found

17:05.242 --> 17:06.176
the cartel guys.

17:06.243 --> 17:08.178
At least two shooters. Ready?
Ready.

17:08.246 --> 17:10.981
One, two, three.

17:11.049 --> 17:12.349
(groans)

17:16.387 --> 17:17.222
Go high.

17:17.290 --> 17:19.224
Yep, I saw.

17:19.291 --> 17:20.292
(groans)

17:23.731 --> 17:25.832
They're both down.

17:25.900 --> 17:27.501
What have we got?

17:27.568 --> 17:31.505
Well, my Skid Row palate
is telling me ephedrine.

17:31.572 --> 17:34.508
The chemical base used to
cook crystal methamphetamine?

17:34.575 --> 17:35.943
How much are we looking at?

17:36.010 --> 17:37.411
Enough to keep a
cartel in business

17:37.479 --> 17:41.648
and this entire city addicted
for a very, very long time.

17:54.471 --> 17:56.905
DEEKS: Callen, Sam, we questioned
the owner of the winery.

17:56.973 --> 17:58.173
He claims they weren't in on it.

17:58.241 --> 17:59.341
I believe him.

17:59.409 --> 18:00.609
I mean, it's a legitimate
business,

18:00.677 --> 18:02.310
big import/export trade.

18:02.378 --> 18:03.912
A crate like that
could've come and gone

18:03.980 --> 18:05.280
without management
ever knowing about it.

18:05.348 --> 18:07.716
Our narco guys say that the
ephedrine inside the crate

18:07.783 --> 18:10.719
has a street value
of $100 million.

18:14.824 --> 18:17.226
If they deliver the crate
to its final destination,

18:17.293 --> 18:18.327
the game's up.

18:18.395 --> 18:20.996
Cartel is down
a hundred million.

18:21.064 --> 18:22.865
But they send it by
diplomatic courier,

18:22.932 --> 18:25.267
cartel gets a free
pass into the country,

18:25.334 --> 18:27.302
then they take delivery
by setting up a hijacking.

18:27.369 --> 18:30.405
The couriers make sure
no one gets killed.

18:30.472 --> 18:32.240
Then they walk away
free and clear.

18:32.307 --> 18:34.208
No one's the wiser.

18:35.777 --> 18:37.745
Time to share.

18:45.955 --> 18:48.190
So, your crate was filled with
pharmaceutical-grade ephedrine.

18:48.257 --> 18:50.959
We're couriers.

18:51.027 --> 18:53.862
We deliver packages
and don't ask any questions.

18:53.930 --> 18:55.965
Not being attached to things

18:56.033 --> 18:58.034
is the best part of my job.

18:58.101 --> 19:00.370
It's probably why
I ended up this way.

19:00.437 --> 19:02.539
What way is that?

19:02.606 --> 19:03.907
Alone.

19:03.975 --> 19:07.911
No one can live
like that forever.

19:07.979 --> 19:09.379
Yeah, that's what I tell myself.

19:09.447 --> 19:12.382
I will find
someone someday, too.

19:12.450 --> 19:16.019
But what do you tell yourself
in the meantime?

19:19.756 --> 19:23.293
That I'll discover
whatever I'm looking for.

19:25.362 --> 19:26.395
Maybe it's someone.

19:26.463 --> 19:28.264
Maybe it's an answer.

19:28.332 --> 19:31.534
I just tell myself I'll find it,

19:31.602 --> 19:34.503
and I get by.

19:38.008 --> 19:41.311
You know, I didn't want to work
with a partner at first.

19:41.378 --> 19:46.349
And now he's pretty much
all I have.

19:46.417 --> 19:49.085
But at the end of the day,

19:49.153 --> 19:50.786
Roger is just...

19:50.854 --> 19:52.855
He's just that, he's my partner.

19:52.923 --> 19:54.157
He's not family.

19:54.224 --> 19:57.226
You know, the lines,
they get blurred.

20:00.597 --> 20:03.833
Sometimes that blur is the
only thing that keeps me sane.

20:05.302 --> 20:06.836
Look, Gornt,

20:06.904 --> 20:09.705
he's been acting strange
ever since our van got hit.

20:09.773 --> 20:11.674
Define "strange."

20:11.741 --> 20:14.776
We wanted to stay at the crime
scene, give you our statements,

20:14.844 --> 20:18.313
but he insisted
on debriefing us first.

20:18.381 --> 20:22.285
So, we got there a little
earlier than expected.

20:22.353 --> 20:25.122
And, um, I saw someone
sitting in his office.

20:25.190 --> 20:27.892
He was nervous
and-and jittery.

20:27.959 --> 20:29.794
Who was he?

20:29.862 --> 20:31.830
I don't know.
All I have to do

20:31.897 --> 20:33.465
is scan the building's
security cam footage

20:33.533 --> 20:35.767
to find out
if you're lying.

20:35.835 --> 20:38.236
We're checking now.

20:38.304 --> 20:40.939
I don't know anything about
ephedrine or the Peña Cartel.

20:41.007 --> 20:44.276
For the record, I know
what you're going through.

20:44.344 --> 20:46.346
Being accused of a
crime you didn't commit?

20:46.413 --> 20:49.148
Wanting to start a family
while serving your country.

20:49.215 --> 20:51.350
But you lived
happily ever after?

20:51.417 --> 20:54.986
(chuckles) I have a family
that'll never truly know me.

20:55.054 --> 20:58.123
I have to live with that.

21:00.159 --> 21:02.194
(clears throat)

21:02.261 --> 21:04.830
(chuckles)

21:04.898 --> 21:07.567
Annika lives in
Bidnija, Malta.

21:07.635 --> 21:10.771
Population 308.

21:10.838 --> 21:12.306
I spent Christmas there.

21:12.373 --> 21:14.208
It was paradise.

21:14.275 --> 21:17.244
No cell phones, no Internet.

21:17.312 --> 21:19.613
I couldn't send an e-mail
if my life depended on it.

21:19.681 --> 21:23.016
For once, I felt like I was
living a normal life, you know?

21:23.084 --> 21:25.852
Just me and her.

21:25.920 --> 21:29.089
I love Annika.

21:29.157 --> 21:33.060
But I would never betray
this country or my partner.

21:33.128 --> 21:34.796
Dunross counts on me.

21:34.864 --> 21:36.131
She doesn't have anyone else.

21:36.198 --> 21:37.465
It's like I'm her...

21:37.533 --> 21:38.767
Anchor?

21:40.269 --> 21:42.938
Your partnership is the only
stable thing in her life?

21:43.005 --> 21:44.573
Exactly.

21:44.641 --> 21:46.675
(chuckles)

21:46.743 --> 21:49.011
Look, Clark...

21:51.047 --> 21:53.615
...Gornt wouldn't
need both of you

21:53.683 --> 21:56.252
to get that crate into
the hands of the cartel.

21:56.319 --> 21:59.655
Maybe he just
needs one of you.

21:59.723 --> 22:02.892
What if Dunross is the traitor?

22:02.960 --> 22:05.227
Diane?

22:05.295 --> 22:06.628
No.

22:06.696 --> 22:08.197
No, she didn't do it.

22:10.233 --> 22:11.767
You're covering for her.

22:13.736 --> 22:15.270
What haven't you told me?

22:15.338 --> 22:17.339
We're not traitors!

22:18.874 --> 22:20.676
Neither of these incidents
were our fault.

22:20.743 --> 22:21.943
"Incidents"?

22:22.011 --> 22:24.746
The personnel file

22:24.814 --> 22:27.882
at DSS says that you and Dunross
have a perfect record.

22:30.753 --> 22:32.787
This wasn't the first time
you guys got hit.

22:34.657 --> 22:36.691
Was it?

22:44.667 --> 22:46.735
Callen, Sam...

22:46.802 --> 22:49.103
it, uh, looks like
Dunross is telling the truth.

22:49.171 --> 22:51.639
Gornt met with a man
before the couriers arrived

22:51.707 --> 22:53.174
at a Federal
Building today.

22:53.242 --> 22:54.609
Facial recognition?

22:54.677 --> 22:56.311
Uh, no criminal record,

22:56.378 --> 22:58.813
but the standard DMV
search got a hit.

22:58.881 --> 23:00.414
Jonathan Souza.

23:00.482 --> 23:03.149
He teaches chemistry
at a local community college.

23:03.217 --> 23:06.152
Because Souza can vet
the ephedrine's quality.

23:06.219 --> 23:07.920
Makes sense Gornt would hire him

23:07.988 --> 23:09.955
if he's delivering product
to the cartel.

23:10.023 --> 23:11.323
We still have three hours

23:11.391 --> 23:13.358
till Gornt's plane
touches down in D.C.

23:13.426 --> 23:15.894
SAM:
<i>This wasn't the first time</i>

23:15.962 --> 23:17.929
they got hit.

23:17.997 --> 23:19.398
He's covering
for her, G.

23:19.466 --> 23:24.204
We need to get Kensi and Deeks
to track down Professor Souza.

23:24.272 --> 23:26.173
We get him talking,

23:26.241 --> 23:28.342
he could give us Gornt
and both the couriers.

23:28.410 --> 23:31.112
Assuming both couriers
are guilty.

23:41.257 --> 23:44.193
This wasn't the first time you
and your partner lost a package.

23:44.261 --> 23:46.696
Clark just
cut a deal.

23:46.764 --> 23:48.598
He's testifying
against you.

23:48.665 --> 23:50.566
You're lying.

23:50.634 --> 23:51.934
You're trying to scare me.

23:52.002 --> 23:54.103
I'd be scared.

23:54.171 --> 23:57.306
Unless you've got
something on him.

24:01.479 --> 24:03.847
Something better than Malta?

24:03.914 --> 24:06.917
The reason I'm not going to jail

24:06.985 --> 24:10.655
has nothing to do with
my partner or any hijacking.

24:15.528 --> 24:17.629
Somebody already
cut you a deal.

24:20.432 --> 24:22.767
SAM:
G, we got company.

24:26.939 --> 24:27.973
(Callen chuckles)

24:28.041 --> 24:29.340
Hetty said we got this case

24:29.408 --> 24:30.475
because you'd taken
an interest.

24:30.543 --> 24:31.977
I just found out the hard way

24:32.045 --> 24:34.212
that I've got no leverage
over the courier in there.

24:34.280 --> 24:38.049
You found out that I cut her a
deal without having to tell you.

24:38.117 --> 24:40.485
Color me impressed, gentlemen.

24:40.553 --> 24:41.753
They were hijacked before.

24:41.820 --> 24:45.089
You thought it was an inside job
the first time around,

24:45.157 --> 24:48.292
so you pulled some strings,
got their records cleaned,

24:48.360 --> 24:50.394
gave them room
to screw up again.

24:50.462 --> 24:53.764
Does the name Lauren Hunter
mean anything to you?

24:53.832 --> 24:57.235
Other than frostbite
and paranoia?

24:57.302 --> 25:00.504
She tried using our team
to achieve her own ends.

25:00.572 --> 25:03.107
That didn't work out
so well for her.

25:03.175 --> 25:06.844
You should've been up-front
with us from the start.

25:06.911 --> 25:09.946
Three months ago, a shipment
was hijacked in Jordan.

25:10.014 --> 25:12.983
Same setup: shooters
and a getaway vehicle.

25:13.051 --> 25:14.885
Dunross and Clark
were the couriers,

25:14.953 --> 25:16.620
but their boss was the only one

25:16.688 --> 25:19.456
with power to
arrange everything, not them.

25:19.524 --> 25:21.925
You didn't have any evidence
on Gornt, so you cut a deal

25:21.992 --> 25:24.027
with Dunross so you'd have
a spy inside the DSS.

25:24.094 --> 25:25.862
SAM: Just because
she works for you

25:25.930 --> 25:27.964
doesn't mean she's not in on it.

25:28.032 --> 25:29.865
Honestly, I'm not sure
who's in on it at this point.

25:29.933 --> 25:31.467
That's why I brought
you guys in.

25:31.535 --> 25:33.635
Now, if Gornt's behind
this, he'd need at least

25:33.703 --> 25:36.171
one of them on his side
to pull off the hijacking.

25:36.239 --> 25:37.806
What about the deal
you cut with her?

25:37.874 --> 25:41.411
Condition of Dunross's deal
is she's not in on it.

25:41.478 --> 25:42.912
Prove otherwise,
she's fair game.

25:42.980 --> 25:44.314
We think she's got

25:44.382 --> 25:46.450
something on Clark and
Clark's got something on her.

25:46.518 --> 25:47.718
SAM:
But it doesn't look like

25:47.786 --> 25:49.854
they'll be flipping
on each other anytime soon.

25:49.921 --> 25:51.555
Then keep them
locked up and separated

25:51.623 --> 25:54.992
until we have Gornt
and Professor Souza in custody.

25:57.529 --> 26:00.431
You know, I got to hand
it to Callen and Sam.

26:00.498 --> 26:02.466
Think our partnership is
gonna last five years?

26:02.534 --> 26:03.701
I can't see why not.

26:03.768 --> 26:06.304
Unless one or both of us
dies in the line of duty,

26:06.371 --> 26:08.472
I decide to finally
go off and join the circus,

26:08.540 --> 26:10.107
or your biological clock
goes off

26:10.175 --> 26:12.476
and you pop out a litter
of gifted mutant assassins.

26:12.544 --> 26:13.477
Really?

26:13.544 --> 26:14.811
Well, they're gonna be
fighting for

26:14.879 --> 26:16.479
the side of justice,
naturally.

26:16.547 --> 26:18.548
Naturally.

26:23.789 --> 26:25.289
Jonathan Souza?

26:25.357 --> 26:26.858
NCIS. Open up.

26:28.427 --> 26:30.162
Ready?

26:30.230 --> 26:32.598
Three, two, one.

26:32.666 --> 26:34.734
Federal agents!

26:35.770 --> 26:37.737
I got a body.

26:50.986 --> 26:51.986
It's Professor Souza.

26:59.962 --> 27:01.463
Got him?

27:08.673 --> 27:09.773
DEEKS:
Wow.

27:09.840 --> 27:13.010
You just shot Agent Gornt.

27:15.614 --> 27:17.081
(sighs)

27:17.149 --> 27:20.550
Well, obviously Gornt never got
on that plane to Washington D.C.

27:20.618 --> 27:22.652
No, he didn't.

27:32.027 --> 27:35.763
With Gornt dead,
our entire case rests on

27:35.831 --> 27:39.801
getting a confession
from our two couriers.

27:39.868 --> 27:41.403
The problem is Clark and Dunross

27:41.470 --> 27:42.904
are still
covering for each other.

27:42.972 --> 27:44.139
Yeah, but why?

27:44.207 --> 27:47.943
Does this really come down
to loyalty between partners?

27:48.011 --> 27:49.445
SAM:
How about fear?

27:49.513 --> 27:51.615
I still think Clark has
something more on Dunross.

27:51.682 --> 27:53.984
Well, Dunross clearly has
something on Clark.

27:54.052 --> 27:55.419
And let's not forget,
he's the one with

27:55.487 --> 27:57.488
the girlfriend in Malta
and dreams of starting a family.

27:57.556 --> 27:59.791
SAM: Yeah, but just because he wants
those things doesn't mean

27:59.858 --> 28:01.626
that he'll work with
the Peña Cartel to get them.

28:01.694 --> 28:02.960
True.

28:03.028 --> 28:04.862
But there's also the matter
of him attacking me.

28:04.930 --> 28:07.698
True, there is that.

28:07.766 --> 28:09.133
Are you humoring me?

28:09.201 --> 28:11.669
We baited Clark.

28:11.736 --> 28:12.670
It worked.

28:12.737 --> 28:13.837
But just because Dunross

28:13.905 --> 28:15.405
is a loner with no
obvious motivation

28:15.473 --> 28:16.573
doesn't mean
she's innocent.

28:16.641 --> 28:18.041
Doesn't mean
she's guilty, either.

28:18.109 --> 28:20.543
Fact is, Gornt couldn't have
pulled off a fake hijacking

28:20.611 --> 28:23.213
without one or both
of the couriers being in on it.

28:23.280 --> 28:24.481
I agree.

28:24.548 --> 28:26.082
We don't have
enough information

28:26.150 --> 28:27.884
to make a decision.

28:27.952 --> 28:29.553
It's time for a changeup.

28:29.621 --> 28:31.889
Mr. Hanna, you take Dunross.

28:31.957 --> 28:33.758
Mr. Callen, take Clark.

28:38.030 --> 28:40.065
Deeks.

28:40.132 --> 28:41.866
Well, either one of those
is a burn phone

28:41.934 --> 28:44.202
or he was really in the dark
about call waiting.

28:45.904 --> 28:47.204
This one's his burn phone.

28:47.272 --> 28:48.572
He made two calls today.

28:48.640 --> 28:50.575
Once Mr. Whistle does his magic,
we'll have a better idea

28:50.642 --> 28:52.176
which one of the couriers
was in on it.

28:52.244 --> 28:54.178
Or if it was both of them.

28:54.246 --> 28:56.080
Partners for ten years.

28:56.147 --> 28:59.016
You know each other that long,
work together every single day,

28:59.084 --> 29:00.684
put your lives
in each other's hands...

29:00.752 --> 29:02.886
Yet still manage to hide
the biggest secret in your life.

29:02.954 --> 29:03.988
There's plenty
of stuff about

29:04.055 --> 29:05.423
my personal life
I'd never tell you,

29:05.490 --> 29:07.392
but turning traitor?

29:07.459 --> 29:09.460
What-what are you talking about?

29:09.528 --> 29:11.029
You mean like important stuff?

29:11.096 --> 29:13.531
Important stuff to me,
not to you.

29:13.599 --> 29:16.534
Are we talking about, like,
embarrassing, intimate things?

29:16.602 --> 29:18.903
Because if we are, listen,
Kensi, you can tell me anything.

29:18.971 --> 29:21.439
You know I'm not gonna judge
you, no matter how depraved

29:21.507 --> 29:26.178
or twisted or, hey, kinky
those things may be.

29:26.246 --> 29:27.380
Can we focus?

29:27.447 --> 29:29.215
Oh, I'm focused. Believe me.

29:29.283 --> 29:31.351
On this.

29:31.419 --> 29:33.887
That is certainly not his
laundry detergent travel kit.

29:33.955 --> 29:35.823
Looks like he was
using Professor Souza

29:35.890 --> 29:38.092
to authenticate the ephedrine.

29:38.159 --> 29:39.627
So Gornt realized
that NCIS was onto him,

29:39.695 --> 29:40.995
he didn't want
to take any chances.

29:41.063 --> 29:42.496
Once Souza's job is done,

29:42.564 --> 29:44.298
(snaps fingers)
so is he.

29:47.768 --> 29:49.435
The stakes just
got higher.

29:49.503 --> 29:52.772
Gornt is dead.

29:52.839 --> 29:54.306
There's enough
evidence to send

29:54.374 --> 29:56.375
both you and your
partner to prison.

29:56.443 --> 29:58.944
Misuse of government
authority,

29:59.012 --> 30:02.448
conspiracy, smuggling,

30:02.515 --> 30:05.117
and now accessories
to murder.

30:07.821 --> 30:09.622
I was trying
to protect my partner.

30:09.690 --> 30:11.358
From what?

30:14.529 --> 30:15.462
(sighs softly)

30:15.530 --> 30:17.264
Roger had a drinking problem.

30:17.332 --> 30:21.135
But, technically, DSS can't
discriminate against him

30:21.203 --> 30:23.537
if he reports it
and gets treatment.

30:23.605 --> 30:26.106
Clark didn't want to risk
his security clearance

30:26.174 --> 30:28.608
and career on technicalities.

30:28.676 --> 30:32.378
Agents get sidelined,
despite the rules.

30:32.446 --> 30:34.080
We both know that.

30:34.147 --> 30:36.649
So you kept quiet.

30:36.716 --> 30:38.584
DUNROSS:
I helped Roger get sober.

30:38.652 --> 30:41.287
He's been dry for nine years.

30:41.355 --> 30:44.591
SAM: You risked your own career
to protect him.

30:44.658 --> 30:48.128
Did you do it out of loyalty,

30:48.195 --> 30:51.698
or were you paying him back
for something he did for you?

30:51.766 --> 30:53.800
DUNROSS (sighs):
You don't understand.

30:53.868 --> 30:55.837
Roger is a good agent...
(recorder beeps)

30:55.904 --> 30:58.873
She swore she'd never
tell anyone.

30:58.941 --> 31:02.043
They always do, don't they?

31:02.111 --> 31:04.779
She just put your cards
on the table.

31:11.719 --> 31:13.286
One of our first
assignments was

31:13.354 --> 31:15.222
delivering a
pouch in Baghdad.

31:15.289 --> 31:17.290
Diane didn't spot a tail
in the Green Zone.

31:17.357 --> 31:18.524
It was a rookie mistake.

31:18.592 --> 31:20.259
But a life-or-death one.

31:20.327 --> 31:21.527
We got ambushed.

31:21.595 --> 31:23.629
Traded fire with
some insurgents, held them off,

31:23.697 --> 31:25.064
and then we made the delivery.

31:25.132 --> 31:27.167
And you didn't report it.

31:27.234 --> 31:31.337
Diane wouldn't
be here if I did.

31:31.405 --> 31:34.173
I saw something in her
when we came under fire.

31:34.241 --> 31:37.077
Focus, bravery,

31:37.144 --> 31:39.145
grit.

31:39.213 --> 31:41.881
You can't teach it.

31:41.949 --> 31:43.483
It's a rare thing.

31:43.551 --> 31:46.086
It's exactly the kind of thing
you want in a partner.

31:46.154 --> 31:48.922
So, no...

31:48.990 --> 31:50.691
I didn't report it.

31:50.759 --> 31:52.759
Would you?

31:54.796 --> 31:56.897
You know the math.

31:56.965 --> 31:58.499
There's enough
connecting both of you

31:58.567 --> 32:01.168
to the ephedrine and to Gornt
to get a conviction.

32:03.172 --> 32:07.175
You give me something on her,
or I can't help you.

32:07.243 --> 32:09.745
There's nothing more to say.

32:12.482 --> 32:15.251
Turning on your partner's
a hard thing.

32:16.954 --> 32:19.522
But not as hard
as life in prison.

32:21.525 --> 32:22.625
Clark's the senior partner here.

32:22.693 --> 32:25.194
Maybe he dragged you
into the smuggling ring,

32:25.262 --> 32:29.198
you felt like you
couldn't say no.

32:29.266 --> 32:31.267
I make my own decisions.

32:31.334 --> 32:32.267
Really?

32:32.335 --> 32:36.104
If he did drag you in,

32:36.172 --> 32:38.941
I could have
your NCIS deal altered.

32:40.643 --> 32:42.544
(sighs)

32:42.612 --> 32:44.914
And what if Roger and I
are both innocent?

32:44.982 --> 32:46.949
Hmm?

32:47.017 --> 32:48.951
Then congratulations,
Agent Hanna.

32:49.019 --> 32:52.956
You have just ruined
two people's lives for nothing.

32:53.024 --> 32:55.559
Now, I am done talking.

32:55.627 --> 32:57.194
To everyone.

33:00.466 --> 33:01.599
(beeps)
Oh!

33:01.667 --> 33:03.701
We got a winner in
the cartel lottery.

33:03.769 --> 33:05.502
Ooh, let me
guess-- Gornt?

33:05.570 --> 33:07.538
One of the numbers
on his burn phone

33:07.605 --> 33:10.174
is for the switchboard of
Esta Cuera Imports in Mexico.

33:10.241 --> 33:12.275
Names of two
company officers

33:12.343 --> 33:14.244
match aliases
of known cartel associates.

33:14.311 --> 33:15.645
That sounds like

33:15.713 --> 33:18.181
a front company.
What do they claim to import?

33:18.248 --> 33:21.183
Uh, gourmet food and beverages.

33:21.251 --> 33:22.851
Splash of crystal meth
in your hors d'oeuvres

33:22.919 --> 33:24.453
will really spice up
your cocktail party.

33:24.520 --> 33:25.687
Ooh!

33:25.755 --> 33:27.022
Super lotto.

33:27.090 --> 33:28.657
Esta Cuera Imports
has a cargo plane

33:28.725 --> 33:31.326
arriving at a private airstrip
in L.A. this afternoon.

33:31.394 --> 33:32.895
Hmm. Why stage a hijacking here?

33:32.963 --> 33:34.429
Well, if
the crate arrived

33:34.497 --> 33:35.731
at its official destination,

33:35.799 --> 33:38.100
the recipient
would have opened it up,

33:38.168 --> 33:40.036
and the cartel
wouldn't get their product.

33:40.104 --> 33:42.439
So they would have had
to take possession of it

33:42.507 --> 33:44.007
before that happened.

33:44.075 --> 33:46.343
Now it's just a matter of them
getting it across the border.

33:46.411 --> 33:48.680
Right.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:48.748 --> 33:50.215
The plane's
picking up a shipment

33:50.283 --> 33:52.684
from the
Malibu Springs Winery.

33:52.752 --> 33:54.587
Bill of lading
lists the package's dimensions

33:54.655 --> 33:56.789
as an exact match
to the crate of ephedrine.

33:56.857 --> 33:59.225
They're calling it
a crate of Pinot Noir.

34:01.262 --> 34:03.496
HETTY:
All right, so that's...

34:03.564 --> 34:05.398
Has your team
worked out a plan?

34:06.433 --> 34:07.600
HETTY:
Mr. Beale?

34:07.667 --> 34:09.402
We replaced the ephedrine
with maltose and mannitol.

34:09.469 --> 34:11.036
The cartel won't know
this stuff is fake

34:11.103 --> 34:12.672
until they run a lab test on it.

34:12.739 --> 34:15.908
Their cargo plane
will take delivery

34:15.976 --> 34:17.643
of the Pinot Noir

34:17.710 --> 34:20.312
from the Malibu Springs Winery
as scheduled.

34:20.380 --> 34:24.216
Mr. Hanna and Mr. Callen
will be posing as drivers

34:24.284 --> 34:26.686
contracted by
the winery.

34:26.754 --> 34:28.021
Flight manifest
only lists

34:28.089 --> 34:30.357
the pilot and copilot
as passengers.

34:30.425 --> 34:32.259
That's not much security
for a $100 million shipment.

34:32.327 --> 34:33.726
GRANGER:
Cartel may not want

34:33.795 --> 34:35.562
to attract attention
with a big entourage.

34:35.630 --> 34:37.264
NELL: We've tagged this
crate with GPS

34:37.331 --> 34:40.033
and installed
hidden micro-cams.

34:40.101 --> 34:42.235
Tracking it
will not be a problem.

34:42.303 --> 34:44.071
NELL: Once the cargo
plane makes its way

34:44.138 --> 34:46.474
back to Mexico,
our friends at the DEA

34:46.541 --> 34:48.943
and the Federales
will make the arrest

34:49.010 --> 34:51.545
as soon as the crate
reaches its destination.

34:51.614 --> 34:53.681
Hopefully, it'll be
as straightforward as that.

34:53.748 --> 34:54.782
HETTY:
Mr. Callen,

34:54.850 --> 34:58.452
Mr. Hanna, please be
exceptionally careful.

34:58.520 --> 35:02.458
Pinots can be
deceptively tricky.

35:03.893 --> 35:05.794
CALLEN: <i>If Dunross and Clark</i>
<i>end up in prison,</i>

35:05.862 --> 35:07.296
we're not gonna be able
to keep them safe.

35:07.363 --> 35:08.731
At that point,
it won't matter

35:08.799 --> 35:11.701
if one or both of them was
caught up with Gornt in this.

35:11.769 --> 35:14.972
Potential loose ends, the cartel
will want them silenced.

35:15.040 --> 35:17.775
Yet they're still keeping quiet.

35:17.842 --> 35:20.077
That's loyalty for you.

35:20.145 --> 35:21.446
To a fault.

35:21.514 --> 35:23.414
You know we'd do the same thing.

35:26.184 --> 35:28.085
Yes, we would.

35:29.388 --> 35:31.289
We're here.

35:31.356 --> 35:33.324
Kensi, Deeks,
time to hang back.

35:33.392 --> 35:34.659
Copy that.

35:46.537 --> 35:48.771
It's just the pilot
and the copilot.

35:48.838 --> 35:50.572
Simple handoff.

35:50.640 --> 35:51.840
Uh-oh. Who's this?

35:51.908 --> 35:54.309
CALLEN:
Eric, we've got company.

35:54.376 --> 35:56.010
Black four-door Jeep.

35:57.145 --> 35:59.313
Driver and two passengers.

35:59.380 --> 36:01.214
No plates.

36:06.521 --> 36:08.455
MAN:
Hey, amigo. You're late.

36:08.523 --> 36:09.690
Did I say simple?

36:12.660 --> 36:13.961
Kensi, Deeks, be on standby.

36:14.029 --> 36:15.095
Standby for what?

36:15.163 --> 36:16.263
We'll think
of something.

36:16.331 --> 36:18.199
We always do, right?

36:18.266 --> 36:20.334
Think we can improvise our way
out of this one? (rifle cocking)

36:20.402 --> 36:21.502
Get out of the van!

36:21.570 --> 36:22.937
We've got this, G.

36:23.005 --> 36:25.506
All right, well, if I don't get
a chance to say it later,

36:25.574 --> 36:26.908
five years has been a great run.

36:27.943 --> 36:30.177
Why can't you just humor me?

36:50.319 --> 36:51.820
KENSI:
I count six guys.

36:51.887 --> 36:53.788
DEEKS: One with an
automatic weapon.

36:57.726 --> 36:58.893
What is it?

36:58.961 --> 37:00.227
I just remembered something.

37:00.295 --> 37:02.930
Our first case, where we
breached the safe house.

37:04.533 --> 37:06.434
You were definitely
the first one in.

37:08.737 --> 37:11.005
What happened to my men?

37:11.073 --> 37:12.173
They didn't make it.

37:12.240 --> 37:13.841
Feds got them.

37:13.909 --> 37:15.710
They killed them, but they
couldn't find the crate.

37:15.777 --> 37:18.379
Thankfully, we were able
to recover it.

37:18.447 --> 37:20.381
And who the hell are you?

37:20.448 --> 37:22.216
We're couriers with
the Diplomatic Security Service.

37:22.284 --> 37:24.918
I'm Dunross.
This is my partner, Roger Clark.

37:24.986 --> 37:26.554
MAN: Gornt was supposed
to be here.

37:26.621 --> 37:27.722
CALLEN:
He got called into DC.

37:27.789 --> 37:29.123
MAN: Why didn't he
tell me that?

37:29.190 --> 37:30.290
Ask him yourself--
he should be

37:30.358 --> 37:31.492
on the ground
in two hours.

37:31.559 --> 37:32.693
I took great lengths

37:32.761 --> 37:35.129
to avoid meeting
Gornt's couriers in person.

37:35.196 --> 37:36.297
There's no problem.

37:36.364 --> 37:37.564
You trust Gornt.

37:37.632 --> 37:38.565
Gornt trusts us.

37:38.633 --> 37:39.800
And why should I
trust Gornt?

37:39.867 --> 37:41.068
Huh?

37:41.136 --> 37:44.438
He never mentioned
your partner getting involved.

37:44.506 --> 37:45.806
CALLEN: No way your guys
get their hands

37:45.874 --> 37:46.840
on that crate this morning

37:46.908 --> 37:48.042
unless we're both
in on it, right?

37:48.109 --> 37:50.177
I wasn't talking
to you, Dunross.

37:51.513 --> 37:52.713
Gornt never planned on bringing

37:52.781 --> 37:54.582
your partner in
on this job, Clark.

37:54.649 --> 37:56.617
Yeah, well, plans are fine
until the bullets start flying.

37:56.685 --> 37:58.386
It's complicated.

37:58.454 --> 38:00.488
I'll pay my partner
out of my cut.

38:00.556 --> 38:03.157
I like our plan
the way it was before.

38:04.627 --> 38:05.660
Kill him.

38:05.728 --> 38:08.496
KENSI:
We're ready to move in.

38:08.564 --> 38:11.165
Okay, this is bad, and it's about
to get a whole lot worse.

38:11.233 --> 38:12.400
I'll do whatever you want.

38:12.468 --> 38:13.835
No.

38:15.770 --> 38:17.104
You can understand

38:17.172 --> 38:19.039
I'd prefer not
to give you a loaded gun.

38:20.342 --> 38:21.809
Use your hands, please.

38:21.876 --> 38:24.411
Kill him and prove to me
I can trust you.

38:24.479 --> 38:26.380
Don't do this.

38:26.447 --> 38:27.848
Please.

38:27.916 --> 38:29.449
I'm sorry, partner.

38:29.517 --> 38:30.484
You kidding me?

38:30.551 --> 38:32.552
(groaning)

38:34.722 --> 38:35.722
Hit him again.

38:38.293 --> 38:40.627
(panting)

38:40.695 --> 38:43.864
(groaning)

38:43.932 --> 38:46.200
Again!

38:47.836 --> 38:49.503
(groaning)

38:51.907 --> 38:53.508
(panting)

38:54.543 --> 38:55.776
Finish him.

38:55.844 --> 38:58.412
Callen, we're moving in now!
(engine starts)

39:02.216 --> 39:03.750
(gasps)

39:09.756 --> 39:11.857
(gun cocks)

39:11.925 --> 39:13.926
I said, "Finish him."

39:16.430 --> 39:18.398
(groans)

39:18.466 --> 39:21.235
(rapid gunfire)

39:31.448 --> 39:33.682
(panting)

39:35.318 --> 39:36.618
Are you okay?

39:36.686 --> 39:39.355
Could have pulled your punches
a little bit there, partner.

39:39.422 --> 39:40.990
I did pull my punches.

39:41.057 --> 39:43.058
(groans)

39:44.161 --> 39:45.461
(Nell speaking
indistinctly over phone)

39:45.529 --> 39:46.929
CALLEN:
And you're certain

39:46.997 --> 39:48.728
about Clark's e-mails
to the Peña Cartel?

39:48.753 --> 39:49.631
Yeah.

39:49.632 --> 39:52.234
All right.
Thanks, Nell.

39:54.036 --> 39:55.670
You cut a deal with Dunross.

39:55.738 --> 39:57.705
How'd you know Clark was guilty?

39:57.773 --> 40:00.575
You're not the only ones
who are good at what you do.

40:00.643 --> 40:02.811
Given the circumstances,
I hope you won't mind

40:02.879 --> 40:05.414
if I break the news to
our friend Clark personally.

40:05.482 --> 40:07.116
(chuckles)

40:07.184 --> 40:08.318
Actually, we do mind.

40:12.256 --> 40:14.791
All right, should
I cut the feed?

40:14.859 --> 40:16.259
Not just yet.

40:19.930 --> 40:21.965
You spent Christmas
with Annika Cassar

40:22.032 --> 40:24.434
in a small Maltese
village called Bidnija.

40:24.502 --> 40:26.069
Population 308.

40:26.137 --> 40:27.904
So? I already
told you guys that.

40:27.971 --> 40:29.238
SAM:
During the week,

40:29.306 --> 40:31.240
e-mails were sent
from your secure account

40:31.308 --> 40:32.709
to the Peña Cartel.

40:32.776 --> 40:34.644
I didn't have Internet access.

40:34.711 --> 40:36.545
- Nobody in that village does.
CALLEN: That's true.

40:36.613 --> 40:39.281
Fortunately, we were able
to verify that fact.

40:39.348 --> 40:43.351
That was not the
case for Dunross.

40:44.821 --> 40:46.955
SAM: You hacked into your
partner's e-mail account

40:47.023 --> 40:48.256
and set him up to take the fall

40:48.324 --> 40:49.758
if anything
went wrong.

40:51.194 --> 40:52.594
You weren't
working for Gornt.

40:53.630 --> 40:55.397
Gornt was working for you.

40:55.465 --> 40:57.066
CALLEN: You used Clark's
DSS account

40:57.133 --> 40:58.934
to access a federal
criminal database,

40:59.002 --> 41:00.469
and that is where

41:00.537 --> 41:02.771
your relationship
with the Peña Cartel began.

41:03.807 --> 41:05.941
How could you do this?

41:10.347 --> 41:12.381
Our partnership ended

41:12.449 --> 41:14.851
the moment you fell
for that woman in Malta.

41:15.886 --> 41:18.020
All you talked about
was retiring.

41:18.088 --> 41:21.990
And you were going
to leave me behind.

41:22.058 --> 41:23.659
You were my best friend, Diane.

41:23.726 --> 41:26.462
That never would
have changed.

41:26.529 --> 41:28.964
You wanted a new start.

41:29.032 --> 41:31.366
And this was going to be mine.

41:32.635 --> 41:35.203
But you were never
supposed to get hurt.

41:35.271 --> 41:36.805
Roger, I'm so sorry.

41:36.873 --> 41:39.008
SAM:
Please stand up.

41:41.045 --> 41:43.113
Put your hands
behind your back.

41:43.180 --> 41:45.181
(handcuffs clicking)

42:04.236 --> 42:06.403
Now you may
cut the feed.

42:06.471 --> 42:08.038
(beeps)

42:12.210 --> 42:14.445
Ah.

42:14.512 --> 42:18.249
Think maybe we ought
to, uh, pop this open?

42:18.317 --> 42:19.850
Pop this open now?

42:19.918 --> 42:21.519
It's an '07.

42:21.587 --> 42:24.089
I was thinking I'd let it age
for a few more years.

42:24.157 --> 42:25.891
Save it for a special occasion.

42:25.959 --> 42:27.260
Oh, this isn't
a special occasion?

42:27.327 --> 42:28.361
(laughs)

42:28.429 --> 42:29.729
Let's try your beer instead.

42:30.898 --> 42:32.165
You said you
don't like beer.

42:32.233 --> 42:33.867
I never tried Belgian beer.

42:33.934 --> 42:35.635
I'll sip it with
an open mind.

42:35.703 --> 42:36.936
No.

42:37.004 --> 42:39.705
I... I mean, I'm saving that
for a special occasion.

42:39.773 --> 42:41.273
Five years-- we got to toast
with something.

42:41.341 --> 42:42.407
CALLEN:
True.

42:42.475 --> 42:44.476
Mr. Callen, Mr. Hanna.

42:49.415 --> 42:53.415
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00ff00>elderman</font> ==

42:53.418 --> 42:56.453
Don't even think
