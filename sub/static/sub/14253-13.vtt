WEBVTT

00:03.003 --> 00:06.495
Captain's Log,
Stardate 53556.4.

00:06.606 --> 00:08.574
We've towed
a damaged vessel aboard

00:08.641 --> 00:09.869
and are attempting to repair it

00:09.943 --> 00:12.207
while the Doctor treats
the Qomarian crew

00:12.278 --> 00:14.610
who have suffered
minor injuries.

00:15.682 --> 00:16.774
Stay away.

00:16.850 --> 00:18.943
lf you don't cooperate,
l can't treat you.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.509
When we agreed
to be examined

00:20.587 --> 00:22.179
by this ship's
Medical Officer,

00:22.255 --> 00:23.722
we didn't know that you were

00:23.790 --> 00:25.280
a primitive computer matrix.

00:25.358 --> 00:27.292
l assure you there is
nothing primitive about me.

00:27.360 --> 00:28.622
Hmm.

00:28.695 --> 00:29.753
l am programmed to perform

00:29.829 --> 00:31.626
more than five million
medical procedures.

00:31.698 --> 00:33.632
Does that include
bloodletting?

00:33.700 --> 00:36.828
No, but l'll be happy to
add it to my repertoire.

00:38.505 --> 00:44.375
We are ready to
return to our ship.

00:44.444 --> 00:48.676
Could you contact one
of your superiors?

00:48.748 --> 00:49.976
Doctor to the Captain.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.449
Please report to Sick Bay.

00:51.518 --> 00:53.008
Already on my way.

00:53.086 --> 00:57.580
The Captain is
coming here now.

00:57.657 --> 01:04.756
lf you want to talk to her,
you can have a seat.

01:08.501 --> 01:11.937
lt is a very
irritating program.

01:12.005 --> 01:15.805
Maybe we can disable
its speech subroutines.

01:18.511 --> 01:20.604
You're not authorized
to do that.

01:20.680 --> 01:21.977
How are our guests?

01:23.016 --> 01:24.313
Their injuries are minor.

01:24.384 --> 01:26.318
Unfortunately, l
can't say the same

01:26.386 --> 01:27.785
for their lack of manners.

01:27.854 --> 01:28.786
Doctor.

01:28.855 --> 01:30.823
What is the status
of our ship?

01:30.890 --> 01:31.948
To be honest,

01:32.058 --> 01:33.650
we're having a little trouble

01:33.726 --> 01:35.694
understanding your technology.

01:35.762 --> 01:37.730
The problem is your technology.

01:37.797 --> 01:40.891
lnterference from your
antiquated scanning devices

01:40.967 --> 01:43.128
shut down
our propulsion system.

01:43.236 --> 01:45.101
Forgive us, Captain.

01:45.171 --> 01:47.002
We live
in a closed system.

01:47.140 --> 01:48.664
We are not accustomed

01:48.775 --> 01:51.175
to interacting
with other species,

01:51.244 --> 01:53.109
especially inferior ones.

01:53.179 --> 01:55.113
Well, then...

01:55.181 --> 02:00.016
l guess we'll leave the repairs
in your superior hands.

02:00.053 --> 02:02.385
Our injuries will have
to be treated first.

02:02.455 --> 02:04.685
ls there someone other
than this hologram

02:04.757 --> 02:05.724
who could help us?

02:05.792 --> 02:08.226
No one who's better qualified.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.228
Hmm.

02:10.295 --> 02:11.558
Very well.

02:11.631 --> 02:13.064
Try to bear with our

02:13.133 --> 02:16.398
deficiencies
just a little longer.

02:20.006 --> 02:21.473
This way, please.

02:23.000 --> 02:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:37.657 --> 02:41.616
l've been working
on the railroad

02:41.694 --> 02:45.425
All the livelong day

02:45.498 --> 02:47.625
l've been working
on the railroad

02:47.700 --> 02:50.965
Just to pass the time away...

02:51.070 --> 02:53.436
What is that?

02:53.506 --> 02:54.768
This?

02:54.841 --> 02:56.308
A hypospray.

02:56.409 --> 02:57.341
No.

02:57.410 --> 02:59.002
What you were doing.

02:59.145 --> 03:00.772
Preparing your medication.

03:00.847 --> 03:01.779
No.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.372
With your voice.

03:05.118 --> 03:07.416
You mean... singing?

03:07.487 --> 03:09.887
''Singing.''

03:09.956 --> 03:11.389
Do it again.

03:11.457 --> 03:13.925
Yes, do it again.

05:06.606 --> 05:09.473
Someone's in the kitchen
with Dinah

05:09.542 --> 05:12.306
Someone's in the kitchen
l know-ow-ow-ow

05:12.378 --> 05:15.279
Someone's in the kitchen
with Dinah

05:15.348 --> 05:18.215
Strummin' on the old banjo
and singin'

05:18.284 --> 05:21.048
Fee, fi, fiddle-ee-i-o

05:21.120 --> 05:23.987
Fee, fi,
fiddle-ee-i-o-o-o-o

05:24.057 --> 05:29.154
Fee, fi, fiddle-ee-i-o...

05:29.228 --> 05:32.061
Strummin' on the old banjo.

05:32.131 --> 05:35.589
lt is a unique
mathematical variation.

05:35.668 --> 05:36.828
Difficult to quantify.

05:36.936 --> 05:39.666
How do you suppose
the algorithms are generated?

05:39.772 --> 05:40.898
Maybe it's a fractal.

05:41.040 --> 05:42.701
Or wave-form calculus.

05:42.775 --> 05:45.801
Do you mean to say a culture
as superior as yours

05:45.878 --> 05:49.143
has never heard music
of any kind?

05:49.215 --> 05:50.944
There are other
kinds of music?

05:51.017 --> 05:52.450
Of course.

05:52.518 --> 05:55.954
The little ditty l just sang is
an early American folk song,

05:56.022 --> 05:58.081
but countless cultures
have produced

05:58.157 --> 05:59.556
thousands of types of...

05:59.625 --> 06:00.819
music--

06:00.893 --> 06:04.158
instrumental,
choral, orchestral.

06:04.230 --> 06:05.424
What is the purpose

06:05.498 --> 06:07.090
of this ''music''?

06:07.166 --> 06:10.431
ls it an encryption
code of some kind?

06:10.536 --> 06:13.528
There is a mathematical
component to music,

06:13.639 --> 06:17.200
but primarily it's a form
of artistic expression.

06:17.276 --> 06:20.211
''Artistic expression''?

06:20.279 --> 06:22.213
Using sounds and images

06:22.281 --> 06:25.216
to convey ideas and emotions.

06:25.284 --> 06:27.081
Why would anyone do that?

06:27.153 --> 06:31.886
Well... to... communicate
their feelings.

06:31.958 --> 06:35.155
Can't they do that
through speech?

06:35.228 --> 06:38.026
Yes, but music
is much more...

06:38.097 --> 06:40.725
expressive and entertaining.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.233
You mean to say

06:42.335 --> 06:45.771
that this ''music'' is...
recreational?

06:48.508 --> 06:50.237
lt does have
other applications.

06:50.309 --> 06:52.869
Uh, as a matter of fact,
l've recently been doing

06:52.945 --> 06:56.938
some research into
its therapeutic properties,

06:57.016 --> 06:58.813
but... yes, primarily,

06:58.885 --> 07:02.412
we use it for... enjoyment.

07:03.890 --> 07:04.948
''We''?

07:05.024 --> 07:07.254
You mean to say
others aboard your ship

07:07.326 --> 07:09.817
are capable
of producing this phenomenon?

07:09.896 --> 07:12.262
Well, maybe not
with my level of expertise,

07:12.331 --> 07:14.925
but there are
quite a few members of this crew

07:15.034 --> 07:16.501
who possess musical skills.

07:16.602 --> 07:19.036
Maybe we judged this
culture too quickly.

07:19.105 --> 07:20.538
Hmm.

07:20.606 --> 07:22.039
Our database contains
the works

07:22.108 --> 07:24.042
of thousands
of musicians and composers.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.874
lf you'd like, l could download
some selections for you.

07:26.946 --> 07:30.404
Could you sing them for us?

07:34.053 --> 07:35.884
Captain's Log, supplemental.

07:36.022 --> 07:39.219
The Qomar have
completed repairs to their ship

07:39.292 --> 07:40.452
and, surprisingly,

07:40.526 --> 07:43.120
have invited us
to visit their system.

07:43.196 --> 07:46.461
Apparently, it's no longer
''closed'' to outsiders.

07:47.533 --> 07:49.899
Harry, can you make sense
of any of this?

07:50.002 --> 07:52.562
We're picking up thousands
of subspace transmissions,

07:52.672 --> 07:53.900
all encrypted differently.

07:54.073 --> 07:56.473
Between the satellites
and the spacecraft,

07:56.542 --> 07:58.942
it's like navigating
an obstacle course.

07:59.011 --> 08:00.035
With all this traffic,

08:00.112 --> 08:01.807
the Qomar might not
even know we're here.

08:01.881 --> 08:02.813
Apparently, they do.

08:02.882 --> 08:04.213
We are being hailed.

08:04.283 --> 08:06.979
Captain, you now have

08:07.053 --> 08:10.318
the privilege
of meeting Prelate Koru.

08:10.389 --> 08:13.381
Welcome to the Qomar
Planetary Alliance.

08:13.459 --> 08:14.585
Thank you, Prelate.

08:14.660 --> 08:15.820
We're looking forward

08:15.962 --> 08:17.520
to learning more
about your culture.

08:17.597 --> 08:19.963
Our civilization is
no doubt intimidating.

08:20.032 --> 08:21.294
We'll do what we can

08:21.400 --> 08:23.664
to avoid overwhelming
you during your stay.

08:23.769 --> 08:24.929
l appreciate that.

08:25.037 --> 08:28.871
l understand
we're not as advanced as you,

08:28.975 --> 08:31.068
but we're fast learners,
and we'd like to...

08:31.143 --> 08:32.075
We want to learn more

08:32.144 --> 08:34.738
about the algorithmic
expressions

08:34.813 --> 08:36.212
you call ''music.''

08:36.282 --> 08:38.182
We're prepared
to give you complete access

08:38.251 --> 08:39.980
to our musical database,
as well as...

08:40.052 --> 08:41.542
Your Emergency Medical Hologram.

08:41.621 --> 08:44.089
We'd consider an
exchange of technology

08:44.155 --> 08:47.125
if you give us complete
access to this device.

08:47.193 --> 08:49.684
l believe he's made
some recordings.

08:49.762 --> 08:51.855
No, not recordings.

08:55.334 --> 08:56.892
How about a recital?

08:57.036 --> 08:59.561
''Recital''?

08:59.672 --> 09:01.071
A live performance.

09:01.173 --> 09:02.435
We can put
together a program

09:02.508 --> 09:03.702
of various styles of music.

09:03.776 --> 09:06.768
Uh, will the Emergency
Medical Hologram sing?

09:06.846 --> 09:09.542
He'll be the star attraction.

09:45.251 --> 09:46.513
Thank you.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.076
You're very kind.

09:49.655 --> 09:51.122
That was a selection

09:51.190 --> 09:54.159
from the opera Don Carlos,
composed by Giuseppe Verdi,

09:54.226 --> 09:56.786
a towering figure
in Earth's musical history.

10:02.034 --> 10:04.559
Another human musical form
is called ''jazz,''

10:04.670 --> 10:07.662
which has flourished
since the early 20th century.

10:07.773 --> 10:10.173
Mathematically, you'll find
the rhythmic structures

10:10.242 --> 10:13.803
quite interesting, particularly
the use of syncopation

10:13.879 --> 10:16.347
which is said
to make the music swing.

10:17.984 --> 10:19.884
You may also notice
some fascinating

10:19.952 --> 10:22.477
trigonometric functions
in the counterpoint,

10:22.555 --> 10:25.683
but l suppose l'm going off
on a tangent, aren't l?

10:28.961 --> 10:30.724
He's very funny.

10:30.796 --> 10:32.286
So, without further ado,

10:32.365 --> 10:34.765
l give you Harry Kim
and the Kimtones.

11:03.629 --> 11:07.121
We wish to hear the Doctor.

11:07.199 --> 11:08.359
Yes, the Doctor.

11:08.434 --> 11:09.833
Bring back the Doctor.

11:09.935 --> 11:11.402
We want the Doctor to sing.

11:11.470 --> 11:13.665
Doc, they're dying up there.

11:13.773 --> 11:15.968
You've got to do something.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.675
Pick up the tempo.

11:21.681 --> 11:25.947
That old black magic has me
in its spell

11:26.018 --> 11:30.045
That old black magic
that you weave so well

11:30.122 --> 11:34.616
Those icy fingers
up and down my spine

11:34.694 --> 11:39.290
The same old witchcraft
when your eyes meet mine

11:39.365 --> 11:43.324
The same old tingle
that l feel inside

11:43.402 --> 11:47.668
And then,
that elevator starts its ride

11:47.740 --> 11:50.004
And down and down l go

11:50.076 --> 11:52.840
'Round and 'round l go

11:52.912 --> 11:55.710
Like a leaf
that's caught in the tide...

11:58.417 --> 11:59.509
Well, if you like jazz,

11:59.585 --> 12:00.779
you're going to love
rock 'n' roll.

12:00.886 --> 12:03.150
lt was one of the 20th century's
greatest inventions.

12:03.189 --> 12:06.022
Does the Doctor sing
rock 'n' roll?

12:06.092 --> 12:07.889
l wouldn't say it's
his favorite genre.

12:07.993 --> 12:10.894
No, he's more
of an opera man.

12:10.996 --> 12:14.056
As am l.

12:17.002 --> 12:18.765
Aren't you one
of the musicians?

12:20.272 --> 12:21.239
Harry Kim.

12:21.340 --> 12:22.272
Vinka.

12:22.341 --> 12:23.865
Welcome aboard Voyager.

12:23.976 --> 12:26.604
Um, if you'd like to see
the rest of the ship,

12:26.679 --> 12:28.169
l'd be happy to
give you a tour.

12:28.247 --> 12:29.441
Maybe later.

12:29.515 --> 12:32.006
l was wondering if you could
introduce me to the Doctor.

12:33.853 --> 12:36.117
Congratulations, Doctor,
you stole the show.

12:36.188 --> 12:39.385
Thank you, Captain,
but l can't take all the credit.

12:39.458 --> 12:42.655
There was something in the air,
a certain magic.

12:42.728 --> 12:44.161
lt was one of those
rare moments

12:44.230 --> 12:48.360
when audience and performer
become one.

12:48.467 --> 12:49.525
Doctor.

12:49.635 --> 12:50.567
Prelate.

12:50.636 --> 12:52.228
Tincoo.

12:52.338 --> 12:55.466
l will introduce your singing
to more of our people.

12:55.574 --> 12:57.474
l'm flattered.

12:57.543 --> 12:58.840
You will perform on our planet.

12:58.911 --> 12:59.969
l'd consider it an honor,

13:00.045 --> 13:01.808
but you'll have to negotiate
the terms

13:01.847 --> 13:03.337
with my... representative.

13:04.517 --> 13:06.451
l don't understand.

13:06.519 --> 13:09.044
l believe the Doctor
is referring to me, Prelate.

13:09.121 --> 13:11.521
Another concert would mean
extending our stay.

13:11.590 --> 13:14.081
When would you want
to schedule the performance?

13:14.160 --> 13:16.025
As soon as possible.

13:16.095 --> 13:17.392
The Doctor could perform

13:17.463 --> 13:19.260
at one of the lecture halls
at the university.

13:19.331 --> 13:21.128
l'm not sure a lecture hall

13:21.200 --> 13:23.634
would meet
the acoustic requirements.

13:23.736 --> 13:25.397
l'll help you make

13:25.504 --> 13:28.268
whatever modifications
you think are necessary.

13:28.340 --> 13:31.537
Sounds like you've got yourself
a booking, Doctor.

13:33.212 --> 13:35.680
l'd like to reproduce a backdrop

13:35.748 --> 13:38.239
which was used in
a production of Pagliacci

13:38.317 --> 13:39.909
at Teatro de la Scala--

13:39.985 --> 13:41.953
Earth's most famous
opera house.

13:42.021 --> 13:43.215
lt's beautiful.

13:43.289 --> 13:45.314
Your taste in design
is as refined

13:45.391 --> 13:46.824
as your taste in music.

13:46.892 --> 13:48.189
We'll replicate it for you.

13:48.260 --> 13:49.659
Excellent,

13:49.728 --> 13:52.720
but we still have the problem
with the sight lines.

13:52.798 --> 13:55.323
What's wrong
with the sight lines?

13:55.434 --> 13:57.402
lf you consider the height
of the average Qomar,

13:57.503 --> 13:59.835
it's obvious that anyone
seated in the back five rows

13:59.905 --> 14:01.463
will have an obstructed view.

14:01.574 --> 14:02.541
You're right.

14:02.608 --> 14:04.235
They won't be able
to see anything

14:04.310 --> 14:05.538
but the top of your head.

14:05.611 --> 14:06.976
The glare could blind them.

14:09.114 --> 14:11.674
You'll have to excuse
Lieutenant Torres.

14:11.750 --> 14:14.048
Her appreciation
of music is limited

14:14.119 --> 14:16.849
to a smattering
of Klingon drinking songs.

14:16.922 --> 14:18.184
We'll have to increase

14:18.257 --> 14:20.748
the rake of the floor
by five degrees.

14:20.826 --> 14:22.453
You really think
they're going to redesign

14:22.528 --> 14:24.462
an entire building just
to appeal to your vanity?

14:24.530 --> 14:27.158
Vanity has nothing
to do with it, Lieutenant.

14:27.233 --> 14:29.224
l'm concerned
about my audience.

14:29.335 --> 14:31.803
We are prepared to make
whatever changes

14:31.871 --> 14:34.237
the Doctor thinks
are necessary.

14:34.306 --> 14:36.240
Thank you, Tincoo.

14:36.308 --> 14:37.468
While we're at
it, Lieutenant,

14:37.543 --> 14:39.204
l'll need some help
with my wardrobe.

14:39.278 --> 14:41.576
l'm an Engineer,
not a costume designer.

14:41.647 --> 14:43.410
l'd like you to make
an adjustment

14:43.482 --> 14:45.575
to my mobile emitter
that would allow me

14:45.651 --> 14:47.448
to make quick changes
between songs.

14:47.519 --> 14:48.577
That sounds exciting.

14:48.654 --> 14:49.848
Oh, it will be.

14:49.922 --> 14:53.915
l plan to segue from
Don Juan to Rigoletto

14:53.993 --> 14:55.324
in the blink of an eye.

14:55.394 --> 14:56.918
lt will be a triumph of...

14:56.996 --> 14:58.759
Arrogance
and self-absorption?

15:00.666 --> 15:02.930
Just trying to help.

15:06.205 --> 15:09.265
Your crewmates don't seem
to appreciate your abilities.

15:09.375 --> 15:10.967
You've noticed that, too.

15:11.043 --> 15:14.012
That must be very
frustrating for you.

15:14.079 --> 15:16.377
You have no idea.

15:20.953 --> 15:23.444
We'll be starting
in two minutes.

15:23.522 --> 15:25.786
l'd better get into costume.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.420
How do l look?

15:29.495 --> 15:32.726
You look perfect.

15:40.139 --> 15:43.131
l wish l had a subroutine
to eliminate preshow jitters.

15:43.242 --> 15:45.335
l could help you
add one to your program.

15:45.411 --> 15:47.777
You're very sweet.

15:47.846 --> 15:49.473
l'm just a little... nervous.

15:49.548 --> 15:50.742
Why?

15:50.816 --> 15:53.683
l'm about to expose your
entire culture to music

15:53.752 --> 15:54.878
for the first time.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.945
The responsibility
is... enormous.

15:57.056 --> 15:59.547
Your performance tonight
will be transmitted

15:59.625 --> 16:01.650
to hundreds of millions
of people.

16:01.760 --> 16:04.422
ls that supposed
to help me relax?

16:07.866 --> 16:09.333
lt's time.

16:54.079 --> 16:55.376
Report.

16:55.447 --> 16:57.074
l didn't order a
Red Alert, Captain.

16:57.149 --> 16:58.844
Well, someone did.

16:58.917 --> 17:00.976
The command
originated in...

17:01.053 --> 17:03.078
Astrometrics.

17:03.155 --> 17:04.781
Seven of Nine to the Captain.

17:04.857 --> 17:07.189
l've found evidence
that the Qomar are attempting

17:07.259 --> 17:09.352
to sabotage Voyager.

17:09.428 --> 17:11.657
On my way.

17:14.233 --> 17:16.258
What have you got?

17:16.367 --> 17:17.835
l believe the Qomar
are attempting

17:17.970 --> 17:19.631
to disable our com system.

17:19.738 --> 17:20.704
How?

17:20.772 --> 17:22.172
By overloading it
with millions

17:22.241 --> 17:23.606
of teraquads of
irrelevant data.

17:23.675 --> 17:25.575
What do you mean
by ''irrelevant''?

17:31.083 --> 17:34.143
They're transmissions...

17:34.219 --> 17:36.312
all addressed to the Doctor.

17:36.388 --> 17:37.878
Precisely.

17:37.956 --> 17:40.447
l've only been able
to decipher

17:40.526 --> 17:42.153
a small fraction
of them so far,

17:42.227 --> 17:43.455
but they include invitations

17:43.529 --> 17:45.360
to social
and scientific functions,

17:45.431 --> 17:47.490
requests
for personal encounters,

17:47.566 --> 17:50.899
and cloying tributes
to the Doctor's talents.

17:51.036 --> 17:53.231
Computer, stand down Red Alert.

17:53.338 --> 17:55.363
This isn't sabotage, Seven.

17:55.474 --> 17:57.772
This is fan mail.

17:57.843 --> 17:59.538
Fan mail?

17:59.611 --> 18:01.010
People who admire
performers

18:01.113 --> 18:02.740
are called ''fans.''

18:02.781 --> 18:05.409
The word, l believe,
derives from ''fanatic.''

18:05.484 --> 18:06.917
Exactly.

18:06.985 --> 18:10.352
Why would the Doctor inspire
fanaticism among the Qomar?

18:10.422 --> 18:12.219
Music is new to them.

18:12.291 --> 18:14.782
Clearly, they're
very excited about it.

18:14.860 --> 18:16.054
This glorification

18:16.128 --> 18:18.323
of the individual
is irrational.

18:18.397 --> 18:21.366
The Doctor is merely reproducing
the work of others.

18:21.433 --> 18:23.833
Why do his fans fixate
solely on him?

18:24.002 --> 18:26.562
l suppose he's the embodiment
of what they admire.

18:26.672 --> 18:28.833
He can do something
they can't,

18:28.941 --> 18:30.431
and that makes
him special.

18:30.542 --> 18:32.874
Perhaps, but that doesn't
explain their interest

18:32.945 --> 18:34.606
in the minutiae
of the Doctor's life.

18:34.680 --> 18:36.079
''What does he do

18:36.148 --> 18:37.706
in his spare time?''

18:37.783 --> 18:39.648
''To how many decimal places

18:39.718 --> 18:42.243
can he calculate pi?''

18:42.321 --> 18:46.052
This one wants to know his
favorite quadratic equation.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.820
People have
always fantasized

18:47.893 --> 18:50.418
about knowing
celebrities personally.

18:50.496 --> 18:53.897
l suppose it's a way of making
themselves feel more important.

18:53.999 --> 18:55.557
Tuvok to Janeway.

18:55.634 --> 18:57.067
Go ahead.

18:57.169 --> 18:59.569
We have a security problem
on Deck 2.

18:59.638 --> 19:00.866
On my way.

19:02.541 --> 19:04.168
Just think, Seven.

19:04.243 --> 19:06.711
As personal friends
of the Doctor,

19:06.812 --> 19:09.645
we're the envy of
millions of Qomar.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.578
Our efforts to
accommodate them

19:15.654 --> 19:17.315
have gotten out of hand.

19:17.389 --> 19:19.414
l guess their interest
in the Doctor

19:19.491 --> 19:21.083
is greater
than we expected.

19:22.961 --> 19:24.394
Much greater.

19:24.463 --> 19:26.658
l recommend we refuse
all further requests

19:26.732 --> 19:28.199
for transport
from the surface.

19:28.267 --> 19:29.564
Agreed.

19:29.668 --> 19:30.566
And we should evacuate

19:30.669 --> 19:31.795
these visitors immediately.

19:31.904 --> 19:33.963
They are interfering with
normal ship's functions.

19:34.072 --> 19:36.438
Tuvok, when have functions
aboard this ship

19:36.508 --> 19:37.634
ever been normal?

20:11.210 --> 20:12.837
Thank you for coming.

20:12.911 --> 20:14.572
Please accept this eight
by ten by four

20:14.646 --> 20:15.840
singing replica of me.

20:15.914 --> 20:17.040
Thank you so...

20:17.115 --> 20:19.549
One at a time,
one at a time, now.

20:19.618 --> 20:23.076
Please, now, do not touch
the Doctor's mobile emitter.

20:23.155 --> 20:24.850
Captain.

20:24.923 --> 20:26.322
lsn't this exciting?

20:26.391 --> 20:28.951
l'm not sure that's
the word l'd use for it.

20:29.027 --> 20:29.959
Excuse me.

20:30.095 --> 20:31.585
Sorry, excuse me.

20:31.663 --> 20:32.960
l'm sorry, Captain,

20:33.098 --> 20:34.622
but you'll have
to wait your turn

20:34.700 --> 20:35.792
like everybody else.

20:35.867 --> 20:37.425
l'm not here
for an autograph.

20:37.536 --> 20:38.696
We need to talk.

20:42.641 --> 20:44.836
l'm glad you're enjoying
yourself, Doctor,

20:44.910 --> 20:46.707
but this is getting
a little excessive.

20:46.778 --> 20:48.837
l'm only doing what
l can to ensure

20:48.914 --> 20:52.008
that first contact with
the Qomar goes smoothly.

20:52.117 --> 20:54.415
Does that include
using our replicator reserves

20:54.486 --> 20:56.852
to create miniaturized
versions of yourself?

20:56.922 --> 20:58.480
l would never
do such a thing.

20:58.557 --> 21:00.787
As a matter of fact,
the Qomar have devoted

21:00.859 --> 21:02.224
an entire holo
processing plant

21:02.294 --> 21:03.693
to manufacturing
them for me.

21:03.762 --> 21:05.354
l see.

21:05.430 --> 21:08.194
Well, in any case, you've been
neglecting your Sick Bay duties.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.292
l haven't received
a report in three days.

21:10.402 --> 21:12.029
Oh, come now, Kathryn.

21:12.137 --> 21:13.604
lt's not as though

21:13.672 --> 21:16.402
there's been a flood
of medical emergencies.

21:16.475 --> 21:19.569
l wasn't aware we were
on a first name basis.

21:19.645 --> 21:21.135
l-l meant ''Captain.''

21:21.213 --> 21:22.475
l'm sorry.

21:22.547 --> 21:24.447
Oh, that's perfectly
all right, Doctor,

21:24.516 --> 21:25.949
or do you prefer ''Maestro''?

21:26.051 --> 21:27.780
Please.

21:27.853 --> 21:29.150
Either is acceptable.

21:29.221 --> 21:32.315
Well, then, let me make
it clear to both of you:

21:32.391 --> 21:35.155
Maestro, you're finished
for today.

21:35.227 --> 21:38.355
Doctor, report
to Sick Bay, now.

21:46.338 --> 21:47.703
Well, well, well.

21:47.773 --> 21:50.799
lf it isn't
the wandering minstrel.

21:50.909 --> 21:53.377
What's the nature of their
medical emergencies?

21:53.478 --> 21:55.571
Apparently,
these two young ladies

21:55.647 --> 21:57.444
became dizzy and disoriented

21:57.516 --> 22:00.212
while waiting in line
to see you.

22:00.285 --> 22:01.980
l'll take over from here.

22:02.054 --> 22:03.282
Be careful, Doc.

22:03.355 --> 22:06.688
You seem to be hazardous
to the Qomars' health.

22:06.758 --> 22:07.850
l'm Vinka.

22:07.926 --> 22:09.359
l'm Azen.

22:09.428 --> 22:11.328
Hmm. Neither of you
appears to be ill.

22:11.396 --> 22:14.024
We wanted to meet you
in a more intimate setting.

22:14.099 --> 22:17.466
So we told your security
officer we were sick.

22:17.569 --> 22:19.127
Sick Bay is for medical
treatment only.

22:19.237 --> 22:20.670
l'm afraid you'll
have to leave.

22:20.739 --> 22:22.900
But there's so much
about you we want to know.

22:23.041 --> 22:24.736
Yes, you're a very
stimulating hologram.

22:24.810 --> 22:26.243
l-if you're here for a replica,

22:26.311 --> 22:27.744
they're available
in the Mess Hall.

22:27.813 --> 22:29.041
We don't want a replica.

22:29.114 --> 22:30.911
We want
the full-sized version.

22:30.982 --> 22:32.813
l-l-l'm flattered,
really, but if you

22:32.884 --> 22:34.749
don't leave now,
l'll have to call Security.

22:34.820 --> 22:37.948
l'll bet you can calculate pi
to over a thousand digits.

22:38.056 --> 22:39.546
Security to Sick Bay.

22:39.624 --> 22:42.593
Have you ever balanced
simultaneous equations?

22:42.661 --> 22:45.596
Computer, deactivate
Emergency Medical Hologram.

22:56.007 --> 22:57.975
Here you are.

22:58.076 --> 23:00.374
l needed to find
some peace and quiet.

23:00.445 --> 23:02.413
l want to show
you something.

23:03.982 --> 23:05.142
What's this?

23:05.217 --> 23:06.479
You inspired me to create

23:06.551 --> 23:08.644
my own musical composition.

23:08.720 --> 23:12.121
lt's based on the intersection
of two fractals.

23:12.190 --> 23:14.385
Tincoo, this is extraordinary.

23:14.459 --> 23:16.086
l created it for you.

23:18.096 --> 23:19.893
l don't know what to say.

23:19.965 --> 23:21.455
Will you sing it?

23:21.533 --> 23:23.398
l'm not sure l can.

23:23.502 --> 23:25.936
lt's very complex.

23:33.378 --> 23:34.470
The melody's lovely,

23:34.546 --> 23:36.173
but some
of these notes are well beyond

23:36.248 --> 23:37.510
the human vocal range.

23:37.582 --> 23:38.947
You are not human.

23:39.084 --> 23:40.847
No, but...

23:40.919 --> 23:42.716
l can help you reconfigure
your vocal processors.

23:42.788 --> 23:44.119
l don't think there's time.

23:44.189 --> 23:45.656
My last concert's tomorrow.

23:45.724 --> 23:48.659
Why does it have to be
your last concert?

23:48.727 --> 23:50.592
Because Voyager is scheduled
to depart.

23:50.662 --> 23:52.254
Stay here with us.

23:52.330 --> 23:54.560
l have responsibilities
on Voyager.

23:54.633 --> 23:56.100
They're a resourceful crew.

23:56.201 --> 23:58.101
l am certain they
will find a way

23:58.170 --> 24:00.536
to compensate
for your absence.

24:00.605 --> 24:03.073
l'm not so sure about that...

24:03.175 --> 24:06.872
but even if they could...

24:06.945 --> 24:09.846
Voyager's the only
life l've ever known.

24:09.915 --> 24:11.348
The crew are my friends.

24:11.416 --> 24:14.715
But they don't appreciate you
the way we do-- you know that.

24:14.786 --> 24:18.813
You could have a new
life here as a performer,

24:18.890 --> 24:21.882
surrounded by people
who admire and respect

24:21.993 --> 24:23.290
your talent.

24:23.361 --> 24:25.158
lt's very tempting, but...

24:25.230 --> 24:29.360
By any mathematical standard,
the medical care of 150 people

24:29.468 --> 24:33.871
cannot compare to the cultural
enrichment of millions.

24:33.939 --> 24:38.103
You can't always explain things
with an equation, Tincoo.

24:38.176 --> 24:41.407
What about the simplest equation
of them all?

24:41.480 --> 24:44.074
One plus one.

24:44.149 --> 24:47.050
l don't understand.

24:47.118 --> 24:49.814
The time you have been here

24:49.888 --> 24:53.585
has been the most stimulating
of my life.

24:56.928 --> 24:59.556
l feel the same way
about my time with you.

24:59.631 --> 25:01.292
Then stay here...

25:01.399 --> 25:03.264
with me.

25:13.178 --> 25:15.476
You're resigning
your commission?

25:15.547 --> 25:18.345
l've been asked to stay.

25:20.886 --> 25:22.148
When this all started,

25:22.220 --> 25:25.815
l thought you might have
a little harmless fun,

25:25.891 --> 25:27.882
and that
you'd be responsible enough

25:27.959 --> 25:29.426
to keep it in perspective.

25:29.494 --> 25:31.428
l can see now
that l was mistaken.

25:31.496 --> 25:34.431
This isn't ''harmless fun''
for me, Captain.

25:34.499 --> 25:38.526
lt's a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity to realize a dream.

25:38.637 --> 25:40.468
What about your duty to Voyager?

25:40.539 --> 25:42.700
l take that
very seriously, but...

25:42.807 --> 25:44.035
You're a part of this ship.

25:44.109 --> 25:46.441
You sound as if you're talking
about a piece of equipment.

25:46.511 --> 25:47.535
That's not what l meant.

25:47.612 --> 25:48.704
Then shouldn't l be given

25:48.780 --> 25:49.940
the same respect

25:50.081 --> 25:51.878
as any flesh and blood
member of this crew?

25:51.950 --> 25:53.474
Every member of this crew

25:53.552 --> 25:55.918
is expected to fulfill
his obligations.

25:55.987 --> 25:58.956
lf Harry Kim met an alien woman
on an away mission,

25:59.024 --> 26:00.389
fell in love and decided

26:00.492 --> 26:02.722
to spend the rest
of his life with her,

26:02.761 --> 26:05.924
raise a family, instead
of continuing on this journey,

26:05.997 --> 26:07.828
you wouldn't stand in his way.

26:07.899 --> 26:09.526
You're not Harry Kim.

26:09.634 --> 26:12.535
You're an Emergency
Medical Hologram.

26:12.604 --> 26:15.072
Then you do see me
as a piece of technology.

26:15.173 --> 26:18.006
l have given you
extraordinary freedom--

26:18.076 --> 26:23.036
to explore your creativity,
to go on away missions,

26:23.114 --> 26:25.309
to pursue personal
relationships--

26:25.383 --> 26:26.509
but enough is enough.

26:26.585 --> 26:27.574
Why?!

26:27.652 --> 26:28.744
Because you don't see me

26:28.820 --> 26:30.219
as an equal,
and you never have.

26:30.288 --> 26:31.277
Admit it.

26:31.356 --> 26:32.482
l am responsible

26:32.557 --> 26:34.218
for the medical needs
of this crew.

26:34.292 --> 26:36.988
lf l let you leave,
what kind of Captain would l be?

26:37.062 --> 26:39.895
Every other Starfleet officer
chose to be here,

26:39.998 --> 26:42.262
but l never had a choice--
until now.

26:42.334 --> 26:45.269
l've given this crew everything
for five years.

26:45.337 --> 26:46.634
lsn't it worth anything?

26:46.705 --> 26:48.138
Haven't l earned the right

26:48.206 --> 26:50.766
to self-determination?

26:53.612 --> 26:55.910
You've lost other systems before

26:55.981 --> 26:58.677
and always managed
to find a solution.

26:58.750 --> 27:00.513
You'll manage without me.

27:00.619 --> 27:01.813
What about you?

27:01.853 --> 27:04.083
Will you manage without us?

27:04.155 --> 27:06.316
The Qomar are a technologically
advanced species.

27:06.391 --> 27:08.484
l have no doubt that
my maintenance requirements

27:08.560 --> 27:09.686
will be met.

27:09.761 --> 27:10.819
Now which one of us

27:10.929 --> 27:13.124
is looking at you as
a piece of technology?

27:13.198 --> 27:15.598
l'm not talking about
your maintenance needs.

27:15.667 --> 27:17.760
l'm talking about
your emotional needs.

27:17.869 --> 27:20.531
You've got people on this
ship who care about you.

27:20.639 --> 27:23.403
The Qomar certainly seem
to care about me.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.875
And when their tastes change?

27:25.944 --> 27:28.037
What makes you think
that's going to happen?

27:28.113 --> 27:30.308
Fame is often temporary.

27:30.382 --> 27:32.316
This isn't just about fame.

27:32.384 --> 27:34.579
Oh, really?

27:34.653 --> 27:36.883
lf you must know...

27:36.955 --> 27:39.219
there's a woman involved,

27:39.290 --> 27:46.287
one who appreciates me in a way
no one on this crew ever has.

27:52.937 --> 27:56.236
Well, it sounds like
you'll have everything you need.

27:59.277 --> 28:00.141
l believe l will.

28:00.245 --> 28:01.212
l hope so, Doctor,

28:01.246 --> 28:02.804
because once Voyager's gone,

28:02.881 --> 28:05.816
you won't be able
to change your mind.

28:05.950 --> 28:08.748
That's a risk
l'm willing to take.

28:08.820 --> 28:10.549
As your Captain,

28:10.622 --> 28:14.149
l should refuse
this resignation,

28:14.225 --> 28:16.819
but as your friend,

28:16.895 --> 28:19.693
it wouldn't be right
to stand in your way.

28:29.641 --> 28:31.973
And you can't let the
Captain ignore her health.

28:32.043 --> 28:33.874
She's notorious for
finding any excuse

28:34.012 --> 28:35.274
to miss her appointments.

28:35.346 --> 28:36.870
l'll send her
weekly reminders.

28:36.948 --> 28:38.609
And when Mr. Neelix
becomes convinced

28:38.683 --> 28:40.708
that he's suffering
from the Toluncan Ague--

28:40.785 --> 28:42.218
which he does
every flu season--

28:42.287 --> 28:44.414
don't argue with him,
just give him a placebo.

28:44.489 --> 28:47.424
Doc, l've been assisting
you for three years.

28:47.492 --> 28:48.550
l know the drill.

28:48.626 --> 28:51.151
Yes, l suppose you do.

28:51.229 --> 28:52.719
Remember, l'll be
within com range

28:52.797 --> 28:53.889
for at least another month,

28:53.965 --> 28:55.489
so if any problems
should arise...

28:55.567 --> 28:56.693
Doc...

28:56.801 --> 28:59.895
you're not really going
to do this, are you?

29:00.004 --> 29:02.495
l would have thought
you of all people

29:02.574 --> 29:04.405
would be glad to see me go.

29:04.476 --> 29:05.602
Are you kidding?

29:05.677 --> 29:08.612
Who am l going to torment
after you're gone?

29:12.217 --> 29:14.151
Well...

29:14.219 --> 29:16.119
l've got some more good-byes.

29:16.187 --> 29:18.815
l'll check in with you
before l leave.

29:20.892 --> 29:23.486
l'll be here...

29:23.561 --> 29:25.791
redecorating your office.

29:38.276 --> 29:40.870
Hello, Seven.

29:40.945 --> 29:46.212
l wanted to see
you before l left.

29:46.284 --> 29:48.582
l've downloaded
some social lessons

29:48.653 --> 29:50.120
we haven't covered yet.

29:50.188 --> 29:51.883
There are 17 new chapters.

29:51.956 --> 29:53.890
Does one of them
include instructions

29:53.992 --> 29:55.254
for ending a friendship?

29:56.394 --> 29:58.487
Our friendship's
not over, Seven.

29:58.563 --> 30:00.326
lt will be difficult to maintain

30:00.398 --> 30:02.195
if we never see
each other again.

30:04.936 --> 30:06.904
l know it'll be hard
for you when l'm gone.

30:07.071 --> 30:08.368
l will adapt.

30:10.608 --> 30:13.577
Yes, l suppose you will,

30:13.678 --> 30:16.875
but it'll be hard for me.

30:16.948 --> 30:18.210
Why?

30:18.283 --> 30:20.843
You're getting everything
you've ever wanted.

30:20.919 --> 30:22.887
l thought you'd
be the first one

30:22.954 --> 30:26.583
to understand my desire
to grow as an individual.

30:26.658 --> 30:28.421
What l don't understand

30:28.493 --> 30:31.553
is why you can't do that
aboard Voyager.

30:31.629 --> 30:34.393
l feel l've accomplished
all l can here.

30:34.465 --> 30:36.831
Oh, there's the occasional
medical mystery

30:36.935 --> 30:38.766
that challenges
my programming,

30:38.870 --> 30:40.838
but mostly it's
become routine

30:40.939 --> 30:42.930
and frankly, l
feel my talents

30:43.041 --> 30:44.975
are often taken for granted.

30:45.043 --> 30:48.444
But when l'm standing
on that stage performing,

30:48.513 --> 30:51.914
and l see those rapt
faces in the audience...

30:54.285 --> 30:56.617
l feel l finally
know what it's like

30:56.688 --> 30:58.622
to be made of
flesh and blood.

30:58.690 --> 31:01.215
You simply crave attention,
applause,

31:01.326 --> 31:02.623
fan mail.

31:04.262 --> 31:05.524
What if l do?

31:05.597 --> 31:07.224
Those things
are irrelevant.

31:07.298 --> 31:09.061
To you, maybe,

31:09.167 --> 31:14.571
but to me, it makes me
feel appreciated,

31:14.639 --> 31:17.437
even loved...

31:17.508 --> 31:21.035
Not for what
l've been programmed to do,

31:21.112 --> 31:23.273
but for who l've become.

31:23.348 --> 31:26.909
Doctor, you're receiving
a transmission.

31:26.985 --> 31:28.919
Route it to Cargo Bay 2.

31:28.987 --> 31:30.352
Doctor, this is Tincoo.

31:30.421 --> 31:32.321
l want to see you immediately.

31:32.390 --> 31:34.255
l have something to show you.

31:34.325 --> 31:35.451
What is it?

31:35.526 --> 31:36.652
A surprise.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.593
l think you'll be very pleased.

31:38.663 --> 31:40.631
l'll beam down
as soon as l can.

31:42.333 --> 31:43.322
Seven...

31:43.434 --> 31:45.629
You shouldn't keep
your fans waiting.

32:14.933 --> 32:16.230
Thank you

32:16.334 --> 32:17.801
for being so prompt.

32:17.902 --> 32:19.699
Of course.

32:19.804 --> 32:21.795
What's the surprise?

32:21.906 --> 32:23.339
l had an inspiration.

32:23.408 --> 32:25.376
Another musical composition?

32:25.443 --> 32:26.603
Better.

32:31.416 --> 32:32.576
What's this?

32:32.650 --> 32:34.811
l've solved
all our problems.

32:36.988 --> 32:38.819
l wasn't aware
that we had any.

32:38.890 --> 32:41.222
Well, you were reluctant
to leave your ship,

32:41.292 --> 32:43.055
and you also doubted
your ability

32:43.127 --> 32:45.721
to sing my composition,
so l created a superior

32:45.797 --> 32:47.526
holo-matrix.

32:47.598 --> 32:49.930
l-l don't understand.

32:50.034 --> 32:52.195
lt's simple.

32:52.303 --> 32:56.865
Now you can stay aboard Voyager,
and he can sing for us.

32:56.975 --> 32:58.272
Listen.

33:20.765 --> 33:23.063
You can't make
a superior singer

33:23.167 --> 33:25.226
simply by creating
a new matrix.

33:25.336 --> 33:27.099
l beg to differ.

33:27.205 --> 33:29.105
My vocal processors
are enhanced

33:29.173 --> 33:30.800
with polyphonic sequencers.

33:30.908 --> 33:32.375
l am not only capable

33:32.443 --> 33:34.434
of singing notes
well beyond your limited range,

33:34.512 --> 33:36.912
l can produce
multiharmonic overtones

33:36.981 --> 33:39.575
through the use
of amplitude vacillat...

33:41.753 --> 33:43.846
Why did you do that?

33:43.921 --> 33:45.946
Tincoo, music is more
than mathematics,

33:46.057 --> 33:47.388
and l am much more

33:47.458 --> 33:50.484
than a program
with musical subroutines.

33:52.363 --> 33:55.298
All of my experience,
all of my passion

33:55.366 --> 33:58.130
goes into every note
that l sing.

33:58.236 --> 34:01.364
When you listen to me,
when my singing moves you,

34:01.472 --> 34:04.236
you're not just hearing notes.

34:04.308 --> 34:06.276
You're hearing my artistry...

34:06.344 --> 34:08.471
my... soul.

34:08.545 --> 34:10.878
l've duplicated that, too.

34:10.982 --> 34:13.678
l thought you wanted me.

34:13.751 --> 34:16.549
l did,
but now, l've developed

34:16.621 --> 34:20.489
a far more sophisticated
piece of technology.

34:20.558 --> 34:23.822
Technology...

34:23.895 --> 34:26.226
l thought you would be pleased.

34:26.297 --> 34:28.788
You seemed reluctant
to leave your ship.

34:28.866 --> 34:31.699
You told me that the time
you had spent with me

34:31.803 --> 34:34.772
was the most stimulating
of your life.

34:34.871 --> 34:36.304
lt was.

34:36.373 --> 34:39.172
You inspired me
to do my greatest work.

34:39.243 --> 34:40.369
But l thought...

34:42.547 --> 34:43.946
Yes?

34:44.081 --> 34:46.312
That you and l...

34:48.686 --> 34:50.779
What?

34:56.427 --> 35:00.659
Well, l suppose l'm no longer
on the bill tomorrow.

35:00.731 --> 35:02.130
Of course you are.

35:02.200 --> 35:05.192
lt will be
your farewell performance.

35:07.138 --> 35:10.107
Of course.

35:20.351 --> 35:21.818
You wanted to see me?

35:21.886 --> 35:25.344
l need your clearance code
to delete my medical database.

35:25.423 --> 35:27.721
You sure you want
to do that?

35:27.792 --> 35:29.555
lf you give one of your fans
a heart attack,

35:29.627 --> 35:30.787
you won't be able

35:30.862 --> 35:32.261
to resuscitate him.

35:32.330 --> 35:34.628
l need more space
in my matrix.

35:34.699 --> 35:35.757
For what?

35:35.833 --> 35:38.324
To expand
my musical subroutines,

35:38.436 --> 35:41.872
so that l can sing
this composition.

35:41.973 --> 35:44.669
Well, l'm surprised
you're asking me for help.

35:44.742 --> 35:47.768
l recall your saying that
my appreciation for music

35:47.845 --> 35:51.872
was limited to ''a smattering
of Klingon drinking songs.''

35:51.949 --> 35:53.849
Please, B'Elanna.

35:53.918 --> 35:55.681
l'm asking you as a friend.

35:55.753 --> 35:58.722
Everything depends on this.

35:58.789 --> 36:01.485
What's so important
about this composition?

36:01.592 --> 36:03.184
Tincoo wrote it for me.

36:03.227 --> 36:04.489
Your girlfriend?

36:04.562 --> 36:07.190
l wouldn't call her that.

36:07.265 --> 36:09.256
Don't tell me you
two had a fight.

36:09.333 --> 36:10.823
Let's just say,

36:10.935 --> 36:14.666
she doesn't appreciate me quite
as much as l thought she did.

36:14.772 --> 36:16.034
But that will all change.

36:16.107 --> 36:17.165
Once l perform this,

36:17.275 --> 36:18.833
she will see me for
the artist l truly am.

36:18.943 --> 36:22.811
Look, Doc, l don't know
anything about this woman,

36:22.880 --> 36:24.871
or why she doesn't
appreciate you,

36:24.949 --> 36:27.179
and l may not be
an expert on music,

36:27.251 --> 36:29.617
but l'm
a pretty good Engineer.

36:29.687 --> 36:32.281
l can expand your musical
subroutines all you like.

36:32.356 --> 36:34.654
l can even reprogram you
to be a whistling teapot,

36:34.725 --> 36:39.162
but, if l do that,
you won't be you anymore.

36:49.640 --> 36:51.665
Tonight, l was planning
to perform a song

36:51.776 --> 36:53.573
composed by one
of your own people.

36:53.644 --> 36:56.841
When you consider she heard
music for the first time

36:56.914 --> 36:58.108
only a few days ago,

36:58.182 --> 37:01.117
it's an extraordinary
accomplishment.

37:01.219 --> 37:03.847
But although it's
a very beautiful composition,

37:03.955 --> 37:08.517
l'm afraid
it's beyond my abilities.

37:13.598 --> 37:19.059
So instead, l'm going to sing
an old Neapolitan ballad.

37:19.170 --> 37:21.968
lt's a song about lost love.

39:01.272 --> 39:02.330
Thank you, Doctor.

39:02.440 --> 39:03.498
That was fascinating.

39:03.607 --> 39:04.972
lt is because

39:05.042 --> 39:09.172
of your inspiration
that l can now present to you

39:09.246 --> 39:13.706
a new and exciting
musical program-- a singing

39:13.784 --> 39:15.081
holographic matrix...

39:16.554 --> 39:20.217
designed specifically
to extend the range

39:20.291 --> 39:23.158
of humanoid vocal capabilities,

39:23.227 --> 39:27.527
singing
my own musical composition.

40:24.021 --> 40:25.318
Come in.

40:29.026 --> 40:30.960
Good morning, Captain.

40:31.028 --> 40:32.996
What's this?

40:34.498 --> 40:36.295
A formal request

40:36.367 --> 40:37.664
to be reinstated.

40:39.737 --> 40:43.571
So you've taken off your tails
and put them between your legs.

40:45.242 --> 40:46.709
Yes, ma'am.

40:46.777 --> 40:49.940
You offended a lot of people
who care about you.

40:50.014 --> 40:51.276
l know.

40:51.348 --> 40:52.872
l was a fool, l'm sorry,

40:52.950 --> 40:56.408
and l'm willing to do whatever
l can to rectify the situation,

40:56.487 --> 40:59.888
starting with the deletion
of all my musical subroutines.

40:59.957 --> 41:01.288
Permission denied.

41:01.392 --> 41:02.188
But, Captain...

41:02.226 --> 41:03.284
No ''buts,'' Doctor.

41:03.360 --> 41:04.987
You're expected
to follow orders,

41:05.062 --> 41:07.030
just like every other
flesh and blood

41:07.097 --> 41:08.724
member of this crew.

41:08.799 --> 41:11.893
Resume your normal activities--

41:12.002 --> 41:13.469
all of them.

41:13.571 --> 41:15.630
Yes, ma'am.

41:15.739 --> 41:17.331
Dismissed.

41:35.292 --> 41:37.522
Oh, Seven, l didn't see you.

41:37.595 --> 41:38.755
l suppose

41:38.829 --> 41:40.729
you've come to gloat.

41:40.798 --> 41:42.732
l have something for you.

41:42.800 --> 41:43.960
What is it?

41:44.068 --> 41:45.626
Fan mail.

41:45.736 --> 41:47.601
Delete it.

41:47.671 --> 41:49.832
l don't want
to read another word.

41:49.940 --> 41:51.601
Then l'll read it for you.

41:51.675 --> 41:52.937
Seven...

41:53.010 --> 41:54.602
''Dear Doctor,

41:54.678 --> 41:57.010
''l regret that your
last performance

41:57.147 --> 41:59.707
''was not as successful
as you'd hoped.

41:59.783 --> 42:02.183
''There are still
those who appreciate

42:02.286 --> 42:05.915
''your unique talents
and admire you as an individual.

42:05.956 --> 42:10.256
l'll always consider myself
your loyal fan.''

42:10.327 --> 42:12.386
Who's it from?

42:14.431 --> 42:16.763
lt's signed, ''Seven of Nine

42:16.834 --> 42:19.894
Tertiary Adjunct
of Unimatrix 01.''

42:45.362 --> 42:48.889
l've been working
on the railroad

42:48.966 --> 42:52.561
All the livelong day

42:52.670 --> 42:56.003
l've been working
on the railroad

42:56.073 --> 43:00.203
Just to pass the time away

43:00.277 --> 43:04.213
Can't you hear
the whistle blowing?

43:04.281 --> 43:07.773
Rise up
so early in the morn...
