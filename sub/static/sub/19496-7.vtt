Colin Morello was just in my office...

02:06.009 --> 02:08.548
warning me to stay away
from the firm's finances

02:08.549 --> 02:12.872
because... we took an $800,000 bribe.

02:16.172 --> 02:18.455
That's what I told my dad.

02:19.875 --> 02:21.128
I know.

02:23.722 --> 02:26.582
Look, I know your first

- but for the firm...
- We need to tell the partners.

02:31.139 --> 02:32.878
I'm Mike Kresteva,

02:32.903 --> 02:35.136
head of the DOJ task force, and...

02:35.161 --> 02:38.612
I'm Spencer Zschau, Assistant
United States Attorney.

02:38.855 --> 02:41.901
This firm is responsible
for several major crimes,

02:41.995 --> 02:44.388
but we're gonna start by
focusing on just two of them...

02:44.389 --> 02:46.722
bribery and tax evasion.

02:47.510 --> 02:50.103
One of the name partners in the firm,

02:50.128 --> 02:53.995
Adrian Boseman, accepted
an $800,000 bribe

02:54.020 --> 02:55.480
to help a client evade taxes.

02:55.505 --> 02:58.888
Now, remember the burden of
proof on a grand jury is low.

02:58.889 --> 03:02.039
Your job is merely to
indict, not to convict.

03:02.064 --> 03:04.598
So please keep in mind
you don't need to believe

03:04.623 --> 03:06.262
beyond a reasonable doubt.

03:06.287 --> 03:08.571
You only need to believe
that the accused...

03:08.596 --> 03:10.886
could have committed a crime.

03:13.574 --> 03:16.207
Miss Tascioni, this is an order

03:16.232 --> 03:18.181
from a federal magistrate compelling you

03:18.299 --> 03:20.027
to assist in our investigation.

03:20.052 --> 03:21.582
Mike. Hi.

03:21.607 --> 03:23.715
Well, come on in.

03:24.192 --> 03:27.769
Oh, sorry, I don't
have enough... chairs.

03:27.794 --> 03:29.215
Are you here to arrest me?

03:29.240 --> 03:32.894
No. We're here to confiscate that.

03:35.732 --> 03:38.502
Ada, erase history. Purge all files.

03:38.527 --> 03:40.984
ADA: Understood. Activating.

03:40.985 --> 03:44.694
Congratulations, you just

starring Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey...

03:53.460 --> 03:56.329
ELSBETH (over Ada
device): Ada, no! Cancel!

03:56.354 --> 03:57.872
As the independent observer,

03:57.897 --> 04:01.544
this conversation is determined
to be "not privileged."

04:01.569 --> 04:02.865

indistinct on Ada device)

04:02.890 --> 04:04.132
You're enjoying this.

04:04.157 --> 04:05.880
No, I'm working with you.

04:05.905 --> 04:07.444
I want you to succeed.

04:07.469 --> 04:09.583
ELSBETH (on Ada device): What
were you asking about Kresteva?

04:10.184 --> 04:11.364
Okay...

04:11.389 --> 04:12.638
What?

04:12.663 --> 04:14.653
- ELSBETH: Yeah.
- Listen.

04:15.394 --> 04:17.575
ELSBETH: But yes, this
problem should be an easy fix.

04:17.600 --> 04:19.130
Just back-date receipts.

04:19.154 --> 04:23.190
The important thing is that
Kresteva believes Travis exists.

04:29.800 --> 04:32.230
Just tell me what this is about.

04:37.620 --> 04:39.251
Sit down.

04:39.509 --> 04:40.729
What's going on?

04:40.730 --> 04:42.947
I gave you everything you needed.

04:43.359 --> 04:45.108
Are you working with them?

04:45.133 --> 04:47.455
Am I working with them? Who's them?

04:47.480 --> 04:49.059
The Reddick/Boseman defense team.

04:49.060 --> 04:51.229
Are you helping your daughter
feed us false information?

04:51.230 --> 04:52.993
No. What are you talking about?

04:53.018 --> 04:54.847
Travis Leopold. There was no bribe.

04:54.872 --> 04:56.349
He doesn't exist.

04:56.374 --> 04:58.359
Ms. Tascioni admitted it

04:58.384 --> 04:59.884
on her Ada device.

04:59.909 --> 05:01.328
Here are the two options.

05:01.353 --> 05:03.102
Either you're working with them,

05:03.127 --> 05:05.495
or your daughter knew
you were wearing a wire

05:05.520 --> 05:07.212
and misled you.

05:12.494 --> 05:14.199
I have to see her.

05:14.224 --> 05:17.191
No. She can see you in prison.

05:17.216 --> 05:20.480
- We're having your bail revoked.
- Wait, wait, wait.

05:20.505 --> 05:23.064
- Let me find out what happened.
- (chuckles)

05:23.583 --> 05:26.115
- I can't trust you.
- Please.

05:26.140 --> 05:28.986
I just need to talk to her.

05:34.172 --> 05:35.751
You'll record it?

05:38.430 --> 05:40.633
- AMY: Hi.
- Hi.

05:41.516 --> 05:43.601
- Do we have company?
- Oh, yes.

05:43.626 --> 05:44.809
Your dad's here.

05:44.834 --> 05:46.626
He's in the bathroom. Here.

05:47.422 --> 05:49.282
- What's this?
- Rum and coke.

05:49.307 --> 05:50.501
Oh...

05:50.526 --> 05:51.889
How long has he been here?

05:51.890 --> 05:53.952
- 15 minutes.
- Mm.

05:53.977 --> 05:56.309
What have you guys been speaking ab...

05:56.310 --> 05:57.559
Shit.

05:57.560 --> 05:58.891
What? What's wrong?

05:58.916 --> 06:01.336
Uh, will you keep him occupied?

06:01.363 --> 06:02.953
Okay.

06:03.070 --> 06:06.391
Henry... are you sure
you don't want a drink?

06:06.416 --> 06:08.977
HENRY: No, I don't think
it's a good idea with my bail.

06:09.002 --> 06:10.883
Maia. How are you?

06:10.908 --> 06:12.487
Dad. Good.

06:12.512 --> 06:14.235
Uh, will you give me a sec?

06:17.520 --> 06:19.509
Your apartment looks beautiful, Amy.

06:19.534 --> 06:21.189
Thank you.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.809
We may have to move in a month or two.

06:23.810 --> 06:25.244
Oh, why's that?

06:26.730 --> 06:28.642
Money, Dad.

06:29.020 --> 06:30.361
Oh.

06:30.770 --> 06:32.130
I'm sorry.

06:34.274 --> 06:36.341
Why don't I let you two talk.

06:37.270 --> 06:40.106
- Good to see you, Amy.
- You, too, Henry.

06:55.606 --> 06:57.275
We should talk.

06:57.682 --> 06:59.139
We did.

06:59.140 --> 07:00.572
Yes.

07:01.030 --> 07:02.525
But once more.

07:03.210 --> 07:04.815
Tell me when we're being honest, Dad,

07:04.840 --> 07:07.244
and I'll be sure to switch over.

07:07.979 --> 07:09.822
You didn't trust me.

07:11.100 --> 07:13.439
You told me a lie last time.

07:13.566 --> 07:14.954
There was no bribery at your firm.

07:14.979 --> 07:17.547
Oh, my God. Oh, my <i>God!</i>

07:19.039 --> 07:21.875
This is a farce, Dad.

07:22.105 --> 07:24.644
You were wearing a wire.

07:24.909 --> 07:27.862
If I told you a lie, there was a reason.

07:28.270 --> 07:31.729
Talk to me like I'm your daughter, okay?

07:31.730 --> 07:34.089
I am right here.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.471
It's not what you think.

07:38.496 --> 07:40.182
Why isn't it?

07:46.412 --> 07:47.790
(beeps)

07:51.210 --> 07:52.563
(sighs)

07:58.156 --> 07:59.729
(beeps)

07:59.730 --> 08:01.219
Okay.

08:02.113 --> 08:04.124
Here we are.

08:04.873 --> 08:06.825
I'm not doing this to save my skin.

08:06.850 --> 08:09.242
- They're coming after you.
- For what?

08:09.721 --> 08:11.220
The foundation.

08:11.245 --> 08:13.244
Your signature on the transferred funds.

08:13.269 --> 08:14.484
They were forged.

08:14.509 --> 08:16.906
Honey, I don't think
they'll believe that.

08:17.414 --> 08:19.141
You're saying you were
recording our conversations

08:19.166 --> 08:21.352
and using them <i>against</i> my law firm

08:21.377 --> 08:24.703
out of some clear concern for me?

08:25.149 --> 08:26.809
Yes.

08:26.810 --> 08:28.391
The Feds are threatening
to prosecute you.

08:28.416 --> 08:29.955
- They're lying.
- No, they're not.

08:29.980 --> 08:31.819
Oh, my God, then don't fucking use me

08:31.844 --> 08:34.234
to clear your conscience, Dad.

08:34.770 --> 08:37.389
You want to make a deal
for yourself, do it.

08:37.390 --> 08:38.594
Don't do it for me.

08:38.619 --> 08:41.988
They discovered the lie
on your lawyer's recording.

08:42.013 --> 08:44.867
They found out the bribery was made up.

08:46.850 --> 08:48.678
Why do I trust you, Dad?

08:48.703 --> 08:50.758
Because in, um,

08:50.850 --> 08:52.680
in ten minutes,

08:52.844 --> 08:55.099
your partners will be subpoenaed.

08:55.820 --> 08:58.672
Tomorrow they'll be dragged
in front of the grand jury.

08:59.168 --> 09:01.570
Kresteva doesn't care
about a conviction.

09:01.595 --> 09:03.794
All he wants is an indictment

09:03.819 --> 09:06.031
to destroy your firm.

09:09.269 --> 09:12.518
WOMAN: There are five
essential French sauces.

09:12.543 --> 09:14.895
If you are to learn French cuisine,

09:14.920 --> 09:16.850
these are foundational.

09:17.905 --> 09:21.034
Now, that is a beautiful
velouté, Adrian.

09:21.059 --> 09:22.270
Ah, merci.

09:22.295 --> 09:24.646
Everyone, come and look

BARBARA: He's got nothing on us.

10:18.647 --> 10:21.059
- He has no case.
- He doesn't need one, Barbara.

10:21.084 --> 10:23.057
He'll still drag us in

scream "RICO."

10:24.566 --> 10:26.145
He gets his indictment no matter what.

10:26.170 --> 10:28.878

- You do?

10:28.903 --> 10:30.147
Yes.

10:30.754 --> 10:32.473
Grand juries always indict.

10:32.522 --> 10:34.841
Unless it's a police brutality case.

10:34.866 --> 10:36.535
And then there's the additional problem

10:36.560 --> 10:39.294
that Kresteva no longer
believes our bribery story.

10:39.319 --> 10:40.723
So what do we do?

10:40.748 --> 10:42.934
Well, he doesn't want a conviction.

10:42.935 --> 10:44.560
I like those earrings.

10:44.585 --> 10:47.028
- Especially the shape.
- Thanks?

10:47.053 --> 10:48.669
I wish I could wear earrings like that,

10:48.694 --> 10:50.941
- but they make my face droopy.
- Elsbeth.

10:50.966 --> 10:53.357
Right. Sorry. You're amazing.

10:53.358 --> 10:55.878
Um, he wants to bankrupt you.

10:55.903 --> 10:58.147
ADRIAN: Right. I got a
call from the Paisley Group.

10:58.148 --> 10:59.575
There was a federal
agent over there yesterday

10:59.600 --> 11:01.059
asking questions about us.

11:01.084 --> 11:03.028
BARBARA: He's trying to
scare off our clients.

11:03.053 --> 11:04.489
(sighs)

11:05.482 --> 11:06.902
What?

11:07.598 --> 11:09.270
- What?
- No, you. What?

11:09.295 --> 11:11.754
- You were about to say something.
- No, I just...

11:12.528 --> 11:14.888
I'm not sure if this helps, but...

11:15.106 --> 11:17.737
Kresteva's boss, the
assistant attorney general,

11:17.738 --> 11:21.247
was concerned that the
investigation was seeming...

11:21.505 --> 11:22.817
racist.

11:22.818 --> 11:24.447
How do you know that?

11:24.448 --> 11:27.231
I... I just know.

11:27.653 --> 11:30.237
ELSBETH: That's a possibility.

11:30.927 --> 11:32.488
What's a possibility?

11:32.513 --> 11:36.519
Uh, well, I don't want to say it.

11:36.544 --> 11:37.963
ADRIAN: We're an African-American firm

11:37.988 --> 11:40.706
being persecuted by a
majority white department?

11:40.731 --> 11:43.395
You want us to turn
our answers toward race?

11:43.420 --> 11:44.489
Yes.

11:44.514 --> 11:46.857
The only way to prevent an indictment

11:46.882 --> 11:48.764
is to close down the grand jury.

11:48.789 --> 11:50.482
And the only way to
close down the grand jury

11:50.507 --> 11:52.506
is to convince Wilbur Dincon,

11:52.531 --> 11:54.918
the assistant attorney general,
it's not in his interest.

11:54.943 --> 11:56.818
And the only way to convince
him it's not in his interest

11:56.843 --> 11:59.170
is to turn our answers toward race.

11:59.195 --> 12:02.209
Yep. We have an audience of one:

12:02.234 --> 12:03.428
Wilbur Dincon.

12:03.453 --> 12:06.317
ADRIAN: Barbara, what do you think?

12:06.318 --> 12:08.420
About using race?

12:08.919 --> 12:11.588
Well, it is about race.

12:11.947 --> 12:13.990
Adrian Boseman.

12:14.015 --> 12:17.762
I'm an attorney with the firm
of Reddick, Boseman & Kolstad,

12:17.787 --> 12:21.237
the largest African-American
firm in the Midwest.

12:21.576 --> 12:24.935
Named by <i>American Lawyer</i>
as one of the top ten

12:24.960 --> 12:27.342
black firms in the country.

12:29.512 --> 12:30.826
You finished?

12:31.926 --> 12:33.139
Yeah.

12:34.491 --> 12:37.410
Mr. Boseman, how long have
you practiced law in Chicago?

12:37.435 --> 12:38.733
35 years.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.543
I was sworn in by
Mayor Harold Washington,

12:41.568 --> 12:44.725
the city's first and,
so far, only black mayor.

12:44.750 --> 12:48.147
I actually keep a photograph
of him in my pocket just to...

12:48.172 --> 12:50.721
remind me of the
struggles of black people

12:50.746 --> 12:52.815
who've come before and...

12:53.009 --> 12:54.968
paved the way for me.

12:55.713 --> 12:58.244
Okay, thank you.

12:58.768 --> 13:02.111
Would you agree that suing
the Chicago Police Department

13:02.136 --> 13:05.361
has been a major income
stream for your firm?

13:05.386 --> 13:07.830
I agree that our firm,

13:07.855 --> 13:10.252
as a majority-owned
African-American firm...

13:10.277 --> 13:14.432
Ma'am, I didn't ask
about your racial makeup.

13:14.457 --> 13:17.510
Yes, but you did ask me
to answer in my own words,

13:17.535 --> 13:19.697
and these are my own words.

13:23.846 --> 13:26.487
- Please, continue.
- BARBARA: Thank you.

13:26.488 --> 13:27.736
As I said,

13:27.761 --> 13:31.072
there's no mistaking that, as
an African-American owned firm...

13:31.097 --> 13:34.057
COLIN: "... Certain victims feel
more comfortable coming to us

13:34.082 --> 13:36.172
"than to a majority Caucasian firm."

13:36.197 --> 13:39.174
Question: "Again, this
is not about race, ma'am."

13:39.199 --> 13:41.557
Answer: "You asked for context, sir,

13:41.582 --> 13:44.596
"and the context involves the
racial makeup of our firm."

13:44.621 --> 13:46.160
What the hell is going on?

13:46.303 --> 13:48.221
You were supposed to
stay away from race.

13:48.246 --> 13:50.535
We are. We're not the ones
taking it there, they are.

13:50.560 --> 13:51.666
I don't care who is.

13:51.691 --> 13:54.308
- It's looking like a persecution.
- It's a tactic.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.120
Well, then, go around it.

13:56.145 --> 13:57.886
You need to make it clear

13:57.911 --> 14:00.182
that this is not about race.

14:00.455 --> 14:03.385
- (elevator bell dings)
- <i>... Vita voglio essere uno squalo.</i>

14:03.410 --> 14:04.682
(doors open)

14:08.262 --> 14:13.198
<i>Nella mia prossima vita
voglio essere uno squalo.</i>

14:13.781 --> 14:15.095
What's that?

14:15.378 --> 14:17.416
- Italian.
- Why?

14:17.441 --> 14:19.533
I always wanted to learn Italian.

14:19.740 --> 14:22.199
You are an odd child.

14:22.783 --> 14:24.358
You know what I'm saying?

14:25.604 --> 14:27.973
"In my next life, I want
to come back as a shark."

14:27.998 --> 14:29.417
- (elevator bell dings)
- (laughs)

14:29.442 --> 14:31.692
Great. Makes sense to me.

14:34.488 --> 14:35.777
Hi.

14:35.802 --> 14:38.058
- Marissa Gold, right?
- No.

14:38.083 --> 14:41.810
<i>Nella mia prossima vita
voglio essere uno squalo.</i>

14:42.240 --> 14:45.513
_

14:46.448 --> 14:47.638
ADRIAN: So, he's pivoting?

14:47.663 --> 14:49.722
ELSBETH: Exactly. No more black lawyers.

14:49.747 --> 14:52.029
- Now, he's going after you three.
- For what?

14:52.054 --> 14:54.216
- I don't know.
- We'll find out soon enough.

14:54.241 --> 14:55.785
We're scheduled for
the grand jury tomorrow.

14:55.810 --> 14:58.638
And the good news, we have an audience.

14:58.663 --> 15:01.052
Yep. Wilbur Dincon is paying attention.

15:01.077 --> 15:02.646
So, how do we exploit that?

15:02.671 --> 15:04.447
ELSBETH: Well, let's think.

15:04.448 --> 15:06.357
Let's...

15:15.761 --> 15:17.504
So, we don't want a grand
jury to connect the dots.

15:17.537 --> 15:19.366
What we want is a case that makes
sense... we won't get a conviction

15:19.391 --> 15:21.207
- unless the facts hold up.
- Let's worry about this later.

15:21.232 --> 15:23.043
Grand juries work off of emotion.

15:23.068 --> 15:24.527
First, we need an indictment.

15:24.552 --> 15:26.631
Well, we need an
indictment based on facts.

15:26.656 --> 15:29.488
Uh, hello?

15:29.608 --> 15:31.533
- Hi.
- MIKE: Hi.

15:31.558 --> 15:33.113
Do you need something?

15:33.138 --> 15:35.713
Do you know how much I make
for every subpoena I deliver?

15:35.738 --> 15:36.902
No idea,

15:36.927 --> 15:39.346
but I'm sure you can talk to
the sheriff's office about this.

15:39.371 --> 15:41.918
- $47.
- Great. Good to know.

15:41.943 --> 15:44.871
And this has been a
really good 48 hours.

15:44.974 --> 15:46.519
You've been served.

15:51.260 --> 15:53.850
♪ Jimmy crack corn... ♪

15:53.875 --> 15:56.688
(gasps) Mike, how are you? You're back.

15:56.713 --> 15:58.344
Hello, Miss Tascioni.

15:58.369 --> 16:02.649
You have bitten off way
more than you can chew.

16:02.674 --> 16:05.251
Really? I can chew a lot.

16:05.276 --> 16:07.383
You're suing me in civil court?

16:07.408 --> 16:10.607
Yes, for tortious interference
with contractual relations.

16:10.632 --> 16:13.712
- I thought that was clever.
- You don't believe it?

16:14.305 --> 16:17.633
I believe it the same way
you do your grand jury.

16:17.658 --> 16:19.430
No court will allow you to sue me

16:19.455 --> 16:22.680
at the same time that
you're being prosecuted.

16:22.962 --> 16:25.110
Maybe you're right, Mike.

16:25.665 --> 16:29.002
Hmm. Do you want a fig bar?

16:29.496 --> 16:30.876
No.

16:32.778 --> 16:34.844
Maybe you're right that no court

16:34.869 --> 16:36.446
will allow my suit to go forward,

16:36.471 --> 16:38.470
but you could've told
me that on the phone.

16:38.495 --> 16:40.297
Instead, you came over here.

16:40.322 --> 16:42.313
And you're welcome anytime.

16:43.443 --> 16:44.860
I'll see you in court.

16:44.885 --> 16:46.304
Both courts.

16:46.440 --> 16:48.883
We'll see which one finishes first.

16:59.167 --> 17:00.947
Putting something on top of the pile

17:00.972 --> 17:03.619
is a great way to get me
to move it to the bottom.

17:03.644 --> 17:07.214
(inhales sharply) I don't think
Mr. Boseman would like that.

17:07.718 --> 17:09.627
- What is this?
- No idea.

17:09.653 --> 17:13.152
It's something regarding
the Rindell Ponzi scheme.

17:13.328 --> 17:15.537
JAY: Well, these are Fortune 500 names.

17:15.558 --> 17:17.566
Not all of them, but some.

17:17.590 --> 17:18.950
But look at these numbers here.

17:18.974 --> 17:21.223
Nine digit numbers. What are they?

17:21.249 --> 17:22.998
No idea. Social Security numbers?

17:23.022 --> 17:25.198
No, I checked.

17:26.777 --> 17:28.339
Okay.

17:28.364 --> 17:30.300
My curiosity is whetted.

17:30.325 --> 17:33.465
- Me, too. I like mysteries.
- (light laugh)

17:33.490 --> 17:36.722
Could you find out how this list
might come back to hurt this firm?

17:36.747 --> 17:38.917
- Are we sure it will?
- Oh, yes.

17:38.942 --> 17:41.659
Mr. Kresteva worked too hard to get it.

17:42.718 --> 17:44.769
Okay. I'll take a look.

17:45.255 --> 17:47.085
Thank you.

17:47.654 --> 17:48.733
COLIN: <i>You're kidding?</i>

17:48.758 --> 17:50.753
WILBUR: <i>No. I'm putting you in, kid.</i>

17:50.778 --> 17:53.403
Sir, please. It's not... (sighs)

17:53.428 --> 17:55.448
- I hate him.
- Oh, I see.

17:55.481 --> 17:57.198
Are you under the mistaken impression

17:57.223 --> 17:58.573
that you only defend people you like?

17:58.598 --> 18:00.232
No, I'm under the mistaken impression

18:00.257 --> 18:02.034
I don't defend anyone. I'm a prosecutor.

18:02.059 --> 18:05.736
Yeah, well, when you get this tortious
interference nonsense dismissed,

18:05.761 --> 18:07.798
you can go back to prosecuting.

18:07.985 --> 18:09.446
Sir. (sighs)

18:09.471 --> 18:11.353
I have to...

18:11.378 --> 18:15.204
apprise you of a conflict of interest.

18:15.345 --> 18:16.806
And what's that?

18:16.831 --> 18:20.370
I'm dating one of the lawyers
at the plaintiff's firm.

18:20.712 --> 18:22.478
I see.

18:23.197 --> 18:25.884
- That's not good.
- Yeah, I'm, uh,

18:26.467 --> 18:29.791
not sure that I could be... objective.

18:29.816 --> 18:32.507
I agree. Stop dating her.

18:32.759 --> 18:34.345
Then you can be.

18:34.961 --> 18:37.119
You're late for court.

18:38.371 --> 18:39.996
Jesus Christ, where is everybody?

18:40.021 --> 18:41.496
It's 10:00 a.m. Am I right?

18:41.521 --> 18:44.324
You are right, Your Honor.
The plaintiffs are ready.

18:44.349 --> 18:46.018
Good for you. Stop kissing my ass.

18:46.043 --> 18:47.777
- Where's the defense?
- I'm here, Your Honor.

18:47.802 --> 18:49.293
GALLO: You're late. You had me waiting.

18:49.318 --> 18:52.034
My apologies, Your Honor.
I was just assigned this case.

18:52.059 --> 18:55.043
I don't give a shit. We start
at 10:00, you're here at 10:00.

18:55.068 --> 18:57.223
What do we have today?
Tortious interference.

18:57.248 --> 18:58.473
- Yes, Your Honor. This law firm...
- We ask for an immediate motion...

18:58.498 --> 19:01.230
- ... to dismiss.
- Hey, hey, hey! Stop it.

19:01.255 --> 19:02.910
You first, Mr. Late.

19:02.935 --> 19:04.764
Uh, the defense moves to dismiss.

19:04.817 --> 19:06.106
Mr. Kresteva is in the middle

19:06.107 --> 19:08.236
of an active grand jury investigation.

19:08.237 --> 19:09.566
Initiating these proceedings

19:09.567 --> 19:12.066
is a cynical attempt
to interfere with that.

19:12.091 --> 19:13.672
Vehemently disagree.

19:13.697 --> 19:15.129
Adrian.

19:16.329 --> 19:17.698
Good morning, Your Honor.

19:17.699 --> 19:19.619
Mr. Kresteva's grand
jury investigation...

19:19.644 --> 19:20.893
Objection, Your Honor.

19:20.918 --> 19:23.199
Is he the lawyer or the plaintiff?

19:24.012 --> 19:25.144
The plaintiff.

19:25.237 --> 19:27.026
Well, then, he shouldn't
be arguing in court.

19:27.027 --> 19:28.486
He should be called as a witness.

19:28.487 --> 19:29.936
Oh. Then, I'd like to call

19:29.937 --> 19:31.396
Mr. Adrian Boseman as a witness.

19:31.421 --> 19:33.510
No, excuse me, no. No.

19:33.535 --> 19:35.034
Uh... uh,

19:35.059 --> 19:37.198
Your Honor, you never heard
on my motion to dismiss.

19:37.223 --> 19:39.526
Yeah, but you just told
them to put him on the stand.

19:39.527 --> 19:41.606
No, I-I said he shouldn't
be arguing in court.

19:41.631 --> 19:42.710
The defense is using
this civil action...

19:42.735 --> 19:46.210
"The plaintiff"? Is that
the word you're looking for?

19:48.764 --> 19:51.475
Yes. (clears throat)
The plaintiff... (sighs)

19:51.500 --> 19:55.913
is using this civil action
as a poor man's discovery.

19:55.960 --> 19:59.507
They don't have access
to our grand jury room,

19:59.532 --> 20:01.941
so they are using this court

20:01.966 --> 20:04.466
as a way to find out...

20:06.254 --> 20:08.021
(clears throat)

20:08.046 --> 20:11.647
uh, what's going on
in the grand jury room.

20:13.932 --> 20:15.915
Is that what you were doing, Counselor?

20:15.940 --> 20:17.540
No, Your Honor.

20:17.565 --> 20:19.190
I wish I were that smart.

20:19.215 --> 20:20.594
(chuckles awkwardly)

20:20.719 --> 20:22.298
Good idea.

20:22.301 --> 20:24.856
GALLO: Okay, overruled,
call your witness.

20:24.881 --> 20:26.190
(whispers): Elsbeth.

20:28.111 --> 20:29.878
Make me your second chair.

20:29.879 --> 20:31.179
Why?

20:32.471 --> 20:34.705
Because it's a good idea.

20:35.549 --> 20:38.434
Mr. Boseman, why are you suing
for tortious interference?

20:38.459 --> 20:39.748
ADRIAN: We're losing clients.

20:39.773 --> 20:41.653
Three clients in the past two weeks.

20:41.678 --> 20:43.599
And why is it important
that this case be heard now?

20:43.624 --> 20:47.387
Because this grand jury is the
reason we're losing clients.

20:47.412 --> 20:50.161
Mr. Kresteva doesn't want a conviction.

20:50.186 --> 20:53.168
- He wants our bankruptcy.
- Objection. Speculation.

20:53.193 --> 20:55.317
Uh, that's a proper
objection for a question,

20:55.342 --> 20:56.731
not for a response.

20:56.767 --> 20:59.516
If Mr. Morello has a rebuttal
witness, he should present him.

20:59.541 --> 21:01.075
I would agree. Overruled.

21:01.100 --> 21:02.749
LUCCA: Mr. Boseman,
did any of your clients

21:02.774 --> 21:04.133
explain why they were leaving?

21:04.158 --> 21:06.520
Yes. The Paisley Group said

21:06.545 --> 21:08.707
federal agents came to their workplace

21:08.732 --> 21:10.848
questioning them about our work.

21:10.873 --> 21:12.342
They didn't want the hassle.

21:12.367 --> 21:15.059
And you think this was an intentional
move on Mr. Kresteva's part?

21:15.084 --> 21:16.243
- Objection.
- Absolutely.

21:16.268 --> 21:17.807
This time calls for speculation.

21:17.832 --> 21:19.582
Look at you, making a proper objection.

21:19.607 --> 21:20.770
Sustained.

21:20.795 --> 21:22.145
Nothing further, Your Honor.

21:22.170 --> 21:24.207
Your witness, Mr. Morello.

21:24.299 --> 21:26.176
Thank you, Ms. Quinn.

21:26.201 --> 21:28.944
These three clients you lost,

21:28.969 --> 21:31.012
how important were they
to your bottom line?

21:31.037 --> 21:32.387
Every client is important.

21:32.412 --> 21:35.106
Hmm. That sounds like
not very important.

21:35.131 --> 21:37.309
Objection. Lamely argumentative.

21:37.334 --> 21:39.848
Yeah, no, it sounded
that way to me, too.

21:39.913 --> 21:41.572
How much money a year do you lose

21:41.597 --> 21:43.004
from losing these three clients?

21:43.029 --> 21:45.484
I guess... $1.3 million.

21:45.509 --> 21:48.589
But that's why we need to stop
this leakage now, Your Honor.

21:48.614 --> 21:50.887
And didn't you just
sign Chumhum, a massive

21:50.912 --> 21:55.340
social media empire worth
$86 million a year to you?

21:55.365 --> 21:58.159
- Yes, we did.
- So...

21:58.184 --> 22:00.411
$1.3 million

22:00.436 --> 22:02.039
versus $86 million.

22:02.064 --> 22:04.545
- Those two things are not connected.
- Whah-whah-whah-whah.

22:04.570 --> 22:06.834
- Don't cry poverty in here!
- LUCCA: Oh, we're not crying poverty.

22:06.859 --> 22:08.271
- Ms. Quinn clearly wants to avoid...
- We're just saying that the DOJ is...

22:08.296 --> 22:09.793
- ... any oversight by officials...
- ... intentionally trying...

22:09.818 --> 22:10.887
- and every time they have their hands
- ... to take something...

22:10.921 --> 22:12.761
- caught in the cookie jar...
- (whistles)

22:12.786 --> 22:15.445
No, no, no. Both of
you, back in your seats.

22:15.470 --> 22:16.969
Decorum.

22:16.994 --> 22:19.153
That's what I insist on.

22:19.326 --> 22:21.245
My apologies, Your Honor.

22:21.270 --> 22:22.863
May I ask a quick question?

22:22.888 --> 22:25.473
You may, quietly.

22:25.839 --> 22:28.106
Why is the defendant not here?

22:28.131 --> 22:30.348
I see that the defense sent its lawyer,

22:30.373 --> 22:32.481
but does the defendant
think so little of this court

22:32.506 --> 22:34.739
- that he only sends his lawyer?
- (clears throat)

22:34.764 --> 22:37.202
I believe the plaintiff's
lawyer knows the reason.

22:37.227 --> 22:39.692
The defendant is busy
running a grand jury room.

22:39.717 --> 22:43.528
I see. So, Mr. Kresteva is
too busy for Judge Gallo?

22:44.286 --> 22:46.567
Did you explain that I'm
conducting a grand jury?

22:46.592 --> 22:49.833
I did. It's Judge Gallo. He
doesn't like being dissed.

22:50.349 --> 22:52.200
Dear God. Okay, when?

22:52.225 --> 22:53.786
This afternoon.

22:54.645 --> 22:57.083
This is playing right into
their hands. You know that.

22:57.108 --> 22:58.818
I sure do.

23:00.841 --> 23:02.278
SPENCER: So, Ms. Gold,

23:02.303 --> 23:04.552
what is your relationship
with Diane Lockhart?

23:04.591 --> 23:05.895
She's my boss.

23:05.920 --> 23:08.880
- Also, I consider her my mentor.
- SPENCER: Really?

23:08.942 --> 23:10.931
What does she mentor you in?

23:10.963 --> 23:13.622
Well, since coming to work
at an African-American firm,

23:13.647 --> 23:17.583
I'd say it's becoming aware of
the nature of white privilege.

23:20.911 --> 23:23.755
And you worked with Ms. Lockhart
at her previous firm, did you not?

23:23.780 --> 23:26.880
I did, but that was definitely
not an African-American firm.

23:26.905 --> 23:28.911
It was like the Trump White House there.

23:28.936 --> 23:30.122
(scattered chuckles)

23:30.169 --> 23:32.120
Ms. Gold, we're not asking

23:32.145 --> 23:34.934
about the racial makeup of the firm.

23:34.959 --> 23:36.982
Oh, sorry.

23:37.216 --> 23:39.027
- Touchy.
- (chuckles)

23:39.052 --> 23:40.671
SPENCER: You were aware, were you not,

23:40.672 --> 23:42.614
that Ms. Lockhart had frequent
meetings and phone calls

23:42.639 --> 23:44.691
with Adrian Boseman prior
to going over to his firm?

23:44.716 --> 23:45.921
Absolutely.

23:45.922 --> 23:47.751
Mr. Boseman's firm was representing

23:47.752 --> 23:49.381
a young, African-American man

23:49.382 --> 23:51.333
who had been pretty severely beaten

23:51.358 --> 23:52.669
by a white police officer...

23:52.694 --> 23:56.528
Again, this is not about race, ma'am.

23:56.869 --> 24:00.072
I agree, but you guys
keep asking me about race.

24:02.603 --> 24:05.751
Isn't it true that Ms. Lockhart
slipped privileged information

24:05.752 --> 24:07.421
to Mr. Boseman about this case?

24:07.422 --> 24:10.337
You mean the case about
this African-American kid

24:10.362 --> 24:12.631
being beaten up by the white cops?

24:13.054 --> 24:15.275
I'm sorry, but you asked the question.

24:20.552 --> 24:22.850
Hey, Diane. I think it went great.

24:23.551 --> 24:25.108
Uh, yeah.

24:26.616 --> 24:29.092
Okay, I'm on my way back. Mm-hmm.

24:32.842 --> 24:34.436
(camera clicks)

24:35.967 --> 24:38.233
- It's Andrew Hart.
- DIANE: What does he have on us?

24:38.258 --> 24:40.461
Why is Kresteva calling him to testify?

24:40.462 --> 24:43.124
- Did you see him with anybody else?
- No, he was alone.

24:43.125 --> 24:44.452
ADRIAN: We need to find out what he said

24:44.477 --> 24:46.107
to the grand jury about our firm.

24:46.132 --> 24:47.764
How do we do that?

24:49.962 --> 24:53.710
What did you say to the grand
jury about the plaintiff's firm?

24:53.735 --> 24:56.991
Objection. Grand jury
proceedings are under seal

24:57.016 --> 24:59.100
and cannot be made public,
no matter how clever

24:59.125 --> 25:01.741
- Ms. Tascioni thinks she is.
- GALLO: Sustained.

25:01.766 --> 25:03.215
That's sweet,

25:03.502 --> 25:05.291
complimenting me for being clever.

25:05.292 --> 25:06.356
Thank you.

25:06.381 --> 25:08.107
Nice to see you, Mr. Kresteva.

25:08.132 --> 25:09.792
Oh, how's Deidre?

25:10.083 --> 25:11.442
Oh, she's fine.

25:11.467 --> 25:13.607
GALLO: Uh, hello? Civil court.

25:13.632 --> 25:16.433
- Taxpayers' money being spent.
- ELSBETH: Yes, sorry.

25:16.458 --> 25:19.255
Is it fair to say that...

25:19.280 --> 25:22.171
in an effort to gain some
competitive advantage,

25:22.172 --> 25:25.169
you sought to have
Adrian Boseman disbarred?

25:25.194 --> 25:28.059
Is it fair? No, it's not fair.

25:28.084 --> 25:30.184
I see. Uh-huh.

25:30.209 --> 25:33.974
Well, is it fair to say
that you tried calling

25:33.999 --> 25:36.450
Reddick/Boseman clients
to steal them away?

25:36.475 --> 25:38.317
HART: No, that's not fair, either.

25:38.342 --> 25:40.896
- Not even a little bit?
- Objection, Your Honor.

25:40.921 --> 25:42.982
This is a fishing expedition.

25:45.336 --> 25:46.802
GALLO: Yes?

25:47.161 --> 25:48.482
It's...

25:48.507 --> 25:49.695
(clears throat)

25:49.720 --> 25:51.139
what I said.

25:51.575 --> 25:53.536
Ms. Tascioni, where is this going?

25:53.561 --> 25:55.761
- I just have a few more questions.
- Uh-huh.

25:55.786 --> 25:58.747
Did you ever meet with
Reddick/Boseman clients

25:58.772 --> 26:01.622
in order to steal them
away? Is that fair?

26:05.712 --> 26:08.317
I have not done anything illegal.

26:08.342 --> 26:10.015
ELSBETH: That's not my question.

26:10.040 --> 26:12.286
Did you ever meet with
Reddick/Bosemen clients

26:12.311 --> 26:15.810
with the direct intent of stealing them?

26:16.309 --> 26:18.253
HART: I did what any business would do.

26:18.278 --> 26:21.059
- Which client, Mr. Hart?
- Objection. Relevance?

26:21.084 --> 26:24.703
They're just trying to establish
that the witness is feeding

26:24.728 --> 26:27.481
negative info to the grand jury,

26:27.514 --> 26:29.807
so he can steal their clients.

26:29.832 --> 26:31.317
Exactly, Your Honor.

26:31.342 --> 26:33.839
GALLO: Ma'am, you're an
acquired taste, and...

26:33.864 --> 26:37.497
I don't think I've
acquired it yet, so...

26:37.522 --> 26:39.044
shh.

26:39.330 --> 26:41.420
Please answer the question.

26:43.422 --> 26:45.719
I met for lunch with a Mr. Spiegel,

26:45.744 --> 26:48.914
who owns a string of department stores.

26:51.531 --> 26:53.157
Get to Spiegel.

26:53.182 --> 26:55.117
Hart's trying to poach him.

27:19.088 --> 27:21.729
- Are you in a pissy mood?
- No.

27:21.754 --> 27:23.690
Then come by tonight.

27:25.733 --> 27:28.461
- I've been told to break up with you.
- (chuckles)

27:28.462 --> 27:30.397
You've been told?

27:30.780 --> 27:32.110
Really?

27:33.929 --> 27:35.820
Then you'd better do it.

27:40.473 --> 27:42.226
You're going to get fired.

27:42.251 --> 27:44.913
Mm, I hate my job, anyway.

27:46.318 --> 27:49.291
- BARBARA: Mr. Spiegel, how are you?
- Good.

27:49.292 --> 27:50.961
I hope since you called me

27:50.962 --> 27:52.412
I'm not getting billed for this.

27:52.437 --> 27:54.436
(laughs) Meter's off.

27:54.712 --> 27:57.725
We're sitting down with some
of our clients this week.

27:57.750 --> 28:00.559
We just want to make sure
we're not missing anything,

28:00.584 --> 28:01.653
their needs are being met...

28:01.678 --> 28:03.740
And no one's jumping ship?

28:03.765 --> 28:05.248
(sighs)

28:05.752 --> 28:08.669
There's a smear campaign
against our firm, Anthony.

28:08.694 --> 28:10.146
I want to set the record straight.

28:10.171 --> 28:12.710
You want to know who's
been whispering in my ear.

28:12.735 --> 28:13.849
If I were to guess,

28:13.874 --> 28:16.754
I'd say lately it's
coming from Andy Hart.

28:16.779 --> 28:18.591
You'd be right.

28:20.427 --> 28:22.747
Mind telling me what he said?

28:23.648 --> 28:24.842
SPIEGEL: <i>He warned me</i>

28:24.867 --> 28:28.288
that Reddick/Boseman was in
the path of a major storm.

28:28.318 --> 28:29.813
And that I would be wise

28:29.838 --> 28:31.796
to seek other representation.

28:31.821 --> 28:33.671
Did he say anything about a grand jury

28:33.696 --> 28:35.772
- having been impaneled?
- COLIN: Objection.

28:35.797 --> 28:38.085
Your Honor, I'm not
asking about the content

28:38.110 --> 28:39.546
of the grand jury proceeding.

28:39.571 --> 28:42.577
All I want to know is,
did Mr. Hart use the fact

28:42.602 --> 28:44.522
that he testified before the grand jury

28:44.547 --> 28:45.866
to steal Reddick/Boseman clients?

28:45.891 --> 28:47.600
Objection as to stealing.

28:47.625 --> 28:49.584
Can I get out one statement
without an objection?

28:49.609 --> 28:51.475
Sure, just don't use loaded
words like "stealing."

28:51.500 --> 28:54.395
Okay, which one of your
objections would you like me

28:54.420 --> 28:56.186
to rule on first, Counselor?

28:56.211 --> 28:58.147
The fir... uh, the second.

28:58.172 --> 28:59.499
Overruled.

28:59.524 --> 29:01.858
Would you like to hear
about the first one now?

29:02.678 --> 29:03.881
Overruled.

29:04.249 --> 29:06.708
Sir, did Mr. Hart mention his testimony?

29:06.709 --> 29:08.335
- No.
- GALLO: Thank you.

29:08.436 --> 29:11.210
SPIEGEL: Because he
hadn't testified yet.

29:14.002 --> 29:16.078
Uh, when was it that
you met with Mr. Hart?

29:16.103 --> 29:17.297
Two weeks ago.

29:17.322 --> 29:20.551
LUCCA: And did he mention that
a grand jury would be impaneled?

29:20.552 --> 29:25.125
As I recall, it was the
centerpiece of his presentation.

29:26.437 --> 29:27.485
(cell phone buzzing)

29:27.510 --> 29:28.758
LUCCA: I would direct
the court's attention

29:28.783 --> 29:30.695
to the fact that this would've been

29:30.720 --> 29:33.139
before anyone outside
of Mr. Kresteva's office

29:33.164 --> 29:34.976
would have known about a grand jury.

29:35.001 --> 29:37.120
Is Ms. Quinn questioning
a witness or testifying?

29:37.145 --> 29:39.084
I'm just pointing out the obvious.

29:39.109 --> 29:40.751
How are my favorite

29:40.752 --> 29:42.234
litigation financiers?

29:42.259 --> 29:43.718
Not good, Mr. Boseman.

29:43.743 --> 29:47.125
We just got subpoenaed to
testify before the grand jury.

29:48.263 --> 29:50.133
Oh, shit.

29:53.923 --> 29:55.858
Litigation financiers.

29:55.883 --> 29:57.382
What an interesting title.

29:57.383 --> 30:00.472
- Where'd you guys go to law school?
- We didn't.

30:00.473 --> 30:03.342
Then can you explain how
you've been directly involved

30:03.343 --> 30:05.798
in over 75 civil cases?

30:05.831 --> 30:08.415
We provide financing to law firms

30:08.440 --> 30:11.119
that allows them to
cover operating costs

30:11.144 --> 30:13.223
while undertaking
time-intensive legal battles.

30:13.248 --> 30:15.238
Law firms like Reddick/Boseman.

30:15.263 --> 30:17.390
How many of their cases
have you bankrolled?

30:17.415 --> 30:20.688
- Twenty-one.
- No. 23.

30:20.713 --> 30:22.172
Wha... how do you figure?

30:22.173 --> 30:23.837
The appeal and the Christmas settlement.

30:23.883 --> 30:25.947
- No, that's 21.
- No, 21 plus two is 23.

30:25.972 --> 30:30.001
- GORDON: It's 21 period.
- Okay, let's leave it at 21 or 23.

30:30.235 --> 30:31.899
What does Reddick/Boseman give you

30:31.933 --> 30:34.322
in return for this financing?

30:34.347 --> 30:36.936
An agreed upon percentage
of the settlement amount.

30:36.961 --> 30:38.668
Well, I assume Reddick/Boseman

30:38.693 --> 30:40.931
pays you your percentage out of theirs.

30:40.956 --> 30:42.673
Do you really assume that
or are you just trying

30:42.698 --> 30:44.962
to make a point by saying you assume it?

30:46.013 --> 30:49.204
Where does the percentage
come from, Mr. Warshofsky?

30:49.229 --> 30:52.478
- It's 23, not 21.
- Okay, Jerry, j-just...

30:54.263 --> 30:57.923
From the client's percentage
of money he never would've seen

30:57.948 --> 31:00.164
if it weren't for the money we invested.

31:00.189 --> 31:01.579
MIKE: Thank you.

31:01.604 --> 31:04.763
On February 20, just
before the settlement,

31:04.920 --> 31:07.259
you gentlemen decided to
increase your stake in the case

31:07.300 --> 31:09.858
by investing more money. Why was that?

31:09.883 --> 31:13.283
Mr. Boseman was confident they'd
come in north of five million.

31:13.465 --> 31:16.431
Did he tell you the
basis for this confidence?

31:16.569 --> 31:18.923
He had a-a source on the other side

31:18.948 --> 31:20.823
who told him they were ready to settle.

31:20.848 --> 31:24.330
The other side at the
time being Diane Lockhart.

31:26.915 --> 31:30.853
Did Mr. Boseman tell you what
the other side was nervous about?

31:32.260 --> 31:34.523
They-they discovered a piece of evidence

31:34.548 --> 31:36.979
that would hurt them
if they went to trial.

31:40.815 --> 31:43.092
GORDON: He told us that we're
not allowed to-to tell anyone

31:43.093 --> 31:44.447
what they asked us in there.

31:44.472 --> 31:47.092
Well, that's true, but you
can tell us what you said.

31:47.117 --> 31:48.384
That's free speech.

31:48.425 --> 31:50.143
- I...
- I don't like getting involved in this.

31:50.168 --> 31:52.307
- Let's go.
- Wait, wait. One second.

31:52.332 --> 31:55.744
Now, we have made a
lot of money together.

31:56.497 --> 31:58.025
- Right?
- Right.

31:58.260 --> 32:01.473
So, did you talk about one of our cases?

32:05.506 --> 32:08.229
Was it one of the
police brutality cases?

32:10.383 --> 32:12.593
Is it the one we're running now?

32:15.309 --> 32:17.098
(stammers) No.

32:17.123 --> 32:18.632
I don't think we should answer any more.

32:18.633 --> 32:20.243
GORDON: I-I know, but... (stammers)

32:20.268 --> 32:22.072
Just one more question.

32:22.200 --> 32:26.486
Is it a case that Diane
and I worked on together?

32:29.139 --> 32:32.025
- Yeah, but not together.
- Fuck.

32:32.050 --> 32:34.227
But hey, please, don't swear, okay?

32:34.252 --> 32:35.947
- Ah! Okay. I-I-I got it.
- We...

32:35.972 --> 32:38.244
It bugs out Jer. I'm sorry.

32:38.269 --> 32:39.643
And thank you. Thank you for coming.

32:39.668 --> 32:41.488
- GORDON: Yeah. Yeah, good luck.
- ADRIAN: Thank you.

32:41.513 --> 32:42.838
Let me get that.

32:43.093 --> 32:45.096
- Appreciate it.
- GORDON: Yeah, yeah.

32:45.803 --> 32:47.132
(door closes)

32:47.432 --> 32:48.963
It's about the Toby Kendall case.

32:48.988 --> 32:50.377
They're coming after me

32:50.402 --> 32:52.648
for telling you about
the camera evidence.

32:52.673 --> 32:54.712
You didn't tell me about
any camera evidence.

32:54.713 --> 32:57.105
You told me to hire an associate

32:57.130 --> 32:58.526
who, in turn, discovered evidence.

32:58.551 --> 33:01.855
No, I didn't. I told you more.

33:02.377 --> 33:04.890
- That's disbarrable.
- Diane.

33:06.455 --> 33:08.049
Listen to me.

33:08.213 --> 33:10.197
We all know we get close
to the line sometimes.

33:10.222 --> 33:12.181
Now, we try to stay on
the right side of the law.

33:12.206 --> 33:14.028
You want to be a good lawyer,

33:14.053 --> 33:16.596
you need to get close to
that line and you know that.

33:16.621 --> 33:18.950
This wasn't about being a good lawyer.

33:18.975 --> 33:20.933
This was about getting a new job.

33:20.958 --> 33:24.471
Not for you, for the Rindell kid, Diane.

33:24.700 --> 33:27.029
Stop kicking yourself.

33:27.054 --> 33:28.973
We are dealing with
people who are coming at us

33:28.998 --> 33:31.578
for the smallest infraction.

33:34.414 --> 33:35.713
(sighs)

33:37.050 --> 33:39.377
So, how do we defend ourselves?

33:42.649 --> 33:44.359
Mere puffery.

33:45.855 --> 33:47.256
Seriously?

33:47.281 --> 33:51.035
I haven't used it since law
school, but, hey. (stifled laugh)

33:51.224 --> 33:53.893
I, I don't think I've ever used it.

33:53.918 --> 33:55.191
- Mere puffery.
- Mm-hmm.

33:55.216 --> 33:57.340
(laughing)

33:59.339 --> 34:00.707
Does that even work?

34:00.732 --> 34:03.035
Uh, we will find out if it works.

34:03.835 --> 34:06.426
My guess is they call you next.

34:08.697 --> 34:10.012
Damn it!

34:10.166 --> 34:12.135
- (sighs)
- Yikes, who pissed you off?

34:12.159 --> 34:14.681
Can we do the cute talk
another time please?

34:14.706 --> 34:17.213
- Maybe I can help. What's up?
- (exhales)

34:17.612 --> 34:19.692
A nine-digit number, some repeats,

34:19.717 --> 34:22.108
all connected to top CEOs.

34:22.132 --> 34:23.565
But none of them are from tax returns

34:23.590 --> 34:26.487
or legal cases or employee numbers.

34:28.080 --> 34:30.908
- Did you try Social Security numbers?
- Yes.

34:30.933 --> 34:32.391
Maybe they're passwords.

34:32.417 --> 34:34.260
That just happened
to all be nine digits?

34:34.284 --> 34:36.728
Maybe they're part of some
secret society of rich assholes.

34:36.754 --> 34:38.103
- Oh...
- (gasps)

34:38.329 --> 34:39.579
What?

34:41.178 --> 34:43.353
Just so I'm clear, I
never win at anything.

34:43.378 --> 34:45.627
If it's a lottery ticket, none
of my numbers ever match up.

34:45.652 --> 34:47.201
Okay.

34:47.612 --> 34:49.322
I know this number.

34:49.348 --> 34:51.268
Here, too, and here.

34:54.067 --> 34:55.726
This is my W-2 from last year.

34:55.766 --> 34:57.901
And, uh, here.

34:57.926 --> 34:59.821
There, that number, what is that?

34:59.846 --> 35:01.518
JAY: Federal Tax I.D. Number.

35:01.543 --> 35:03.013
MARISSA: It's the same.

35:04.973 --> 35:06.620
Who are you, Rain Man?

35:06.645 --> 35:08.831
You should see me at
the blackjack tables.

35:08.856 --> 35:10.625
Who's this W-2 from?

35:10.650 --> 35:12.698
My last job, Lockhart, Deckler...

35:13.729 --> 35:16.331
- Oh, shit.
- It's about Diane.

35:16.356 --> 35:18.104
(buzzing)

35:20.250 --> 35:22.879
I did not slip Mr.
Boseman any information

35:22.904 --> 35:24.581
about the Toby Kendall case.

35:24.606 --> 35:27.339
- Hmm. You're sure?
- I am sure.

35:27.364 --> 35:28.823
So Mr. Boseman lied

35:28.848 --> 35:30.887
to these litigation financiers.

35:30.912 --> 35:33.776
No. My guess, it was mere puffery.

35:34.572 --> 35:35.772
Really?

35:35.804 --> 35:38.836
Mere puffery is the
legally acceptable practice

35:38.861 --> 35:40.687
of promoting through exaggeration.

35:40.712 --> 35:43.070
Yeah, I know what it is, thank you.

35:43.095 --> 35:45.648
Let's turn to the work that
you did for the Rindell Fund,

35:45.673 --> 35:47.953
the recently exposed Ponzi scheme.

35:47.978 --> 35:49.781
What is this, Ms. Lockhart?

35:52.572 --> 35:53.797
I have no idea.

35:53.822 --> 35:57.009
Isn't it a list of VIP
clients at the Rindell Fund?

35:57.509 --> 35:59.882
It might be. I have no idea.

35:59.883 --> 36:02.033
Aren't these the Rindell clients

36:02.058 --> 36:03.853
the Fund went the extra mile for?

36:03.878 --> 36:06.462
Backdating gains to avoid taxes?

36:07.173 --> 36:09.012
Um, again, this is news to me.

36:09.013 --> 36:10.814
MIKE: Yes, but...

36:11.736 --> 36:14.158
isn't that your firm's I.D. number?

36:14.183 --> 36:18.001
There and there and there?

36:18.026 --> 36:20.759
Isn't that how the Fund
billed your legal work?

36:20.784 --> 36:22.113
Again, this is my first time seeing...

36:22.138 --> 36:23.547
And isn't this why you arranged

36:23.572 --> 36:25.195
for the Rindell daughter to...

36:25.220 --> 36:27.033
get a job at your new work,

36:27.058 --> 36:29.874
so they wouldn't
expose your culpability?

36:29.899 --> 36:31.134
No.

36:31.159 --> 36:35.201
Well, it's a good thing we have
Henry Rindell coming in tomorrow

36:35.226 --> 36:39.139
to... clear this matter up.

36:58.273 --> 37:00.855
I need to resign from this firm.

37:02.967 --> 37:04.386
Oh, yeah?

37:05.542 --> 37:08.816
- Why is that?
- Because I'm about to be indicted.

37:09.356 --> 37:12.082
Are you... guilty of anything?

37:12.107 --> 37:14.941
Other than being friends
with the wrong people?

37:14.966 --> 37:16.246
No.

37:16.271 --> 37:19.645
Then, do you think it
surprises me that...

37:19.670 --> 37:22.527
someone inside this
firm is being targeted?

37:22.552 --> 37:25.449
DIANE: He has Henry
Rindell in his pocket.

37:25.474 --> 37:27.356
He is going to get an
indictment against me.

37:27.381 --> 37:28.521
Assume he does.

37:28.546 --> 37:30.114
I haven't been here that long, Adrian...

37:30.139 --> 37:32.308
What does that matter, Diane?

37:33.222 --> 37:36.606
I'm not running scared
from motherfuckers like him.

37:38.704 --> 37:41.583
I got to fight him.
You got to fight him.

37:41.905 --> 37:45.325
So, we might as well fight him together.

38:09.380 --> 38:10.870
(sighs)

38:11.807 --> 38:13.966
Bizarre that it's come to this.

38:13.991 --> 38:15.240
Yeah.

38:15.265 --> 38:17.307
- That's one word.
- Hmm.

38:17.409 --> 38:19.658
So what do you need, babe?

38:20.060 --> 38:22.339
You're testifying to
the grand jury tomorrow?

38:22.364 --> 38:24.033
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

38:24.434 --> 38:26.853
You're testifying against Diane?

38:26.878 --> 38:29.315
No, I'm telling the truth.

38:29.538 --> 38:32.409
Oh. Your alternative truth?

38:32.434 --> 38:35.768
Yeah, Diane did a lot of
legal work for the Fund.

38:35.793 --> 38:37.792
Because she was your friend.

38:37.817 --> 38:39.867
No, because we paid her.

38:41.182 --> 38:42.932
Is that why you had
me get the Schtup list

38:42.957 --> 38:45.024
from Uncle Jax's computer?

38:45.049 --> 38:47.681
So that you could use it against Diane?

38:47.706 --> 38:49.995
Make it look like she took a bribe?

38:50.020 --> 38:52.814
No, so I would have some leverage.

38:52.839 --> 38:55.196
You betrayed her for a lighter sentence?

38:55.221 --> 38:56.548
(chuckles)

38:56.549 --> 38:59.635
You won't see any jail
time, Mom won't either.

39:01.858 --> 39:03.245
And you?

39:07.105 --> 39:09.498
I don't want to die in prison, Maia.

39:09.956 --> 39:11.690
I want a chance to see you have kids.

39:11.715 --> 39:13.855
I want to hold my grandkids.

39:16.378 --> 39:17.931
What was the deal?

39:17.956 --> 39:19.308
Ten years.

39:23.948 --> 39:25.498
Don't testify against Diane.

39:25.499 --> 39:27.128
What? I have to.

39:27.153 --> 39:29.355
No. Dad, if they're offering ten years,

39:29.380 --> 39:31.009
they must have a weak case.

39:31.049 --> 39:32.753
It's for you, too.

39:38.753 --> 39:40.541
You do this, Dad,

39:41.072 --> 39:43.479
and if I ever have any kids,

39:44.299 --> 39:46.361
you'll never see them.

39:50.412 --> 39:52.742
I'll never let you see them.

40:03.552 --> 40:05.749
(exhales, chuckles)

40:17.224 --> 40:18.778
I love you.

40:26.264 --> 40:27.918
BAILIFF: <i>All rise.</i>

40:28.553 --> 40:30.803
Okay, let's wind this down.

40:30.828 --> 40:32.197
What do we have today?

40:32.222 --> 40:34.054
- ELSBETH: I just have one more witness,
- Your Honor.

40:34.079 --> 40:35.088
Promise?

40:35.089 --> 40:37.418
I think so. Aren't you having fun?

40:37.443 --> 40:39.247
COLIN: We object to
this witness, Your Honor.

40:39.272 --> 40:40.418
Oh.

40:40.443 --> 40:42.233
All alone again, are you, Counselor?

40:42.258 --> 40:44.337
Yes, Mr. Kresteva thought
it best to stay away

40:44.362 --> 40:46.131
given this next witness.

40:46.156 --> 40:47.459
Now I am curious.

40:47.484 --> 40:49.162
You know who this witness is?

40:49.187 --> 40:51.264
Yes, the subpoena was
served this morning.

40:51.289 --> 40:54.248
And I would like to
reiterate my objection

40:54.273 --> 40:56.734
to permitting this man to testify.

40:56.759 --> 40:59.755
Ms. Quinn, for all her
purported innocence,

40:59.780 --> 41:02.233
seems hell-bent on compromising the
integrity of the judicial system.

41:02.258 --> 41:03.592
Your Honor, I have done
nothing of the sort.

41:03.617 --> 41:04.968
We're saying that that the DOJ...

41:04.999 --> 41:08.467
My God, you people love
to hear yourselves talk.

41:08.492 --> 41:10.131
Call your witness.

41:10.156 --> 41:12.326
We call Henry Rindell.

41:12.351 --> 41:14.260
- GALLO: Thank you.
- Are you all right?

41:14.575 --> 41:16.936
No, not really.

41:17.879 --> 41:20.455
I wish I could tell
you it'll get easier.

41:20.954 --> 41:22.907
I wish you could tell me that, too.

41:22.932 --> 41:25.244
I imagine this is someone
who's going to be testifying

41:25.269 --> 41:27.698
- in front of the grand jury later?
- COLIN: It is, Your Honor.

41:27.723 --> 41:30.644
GALLO: And I imagine you're going
to promise not to ask questions

41:30.728 --> 41:32.774
about what he'll testify to?

41:32.799 --> 41:34.399
ELSBETH: I'll go even
further, Your Honor.

41:34.424 --> 41:36.611
I have just one question
for this witness.

41:36.636 --> 41:38.041
Any objections, Counselor?

41:38.066 --> 41:40.252
Well, that depends on
the question, Your Honor.

41:40.277 --> 41:41.922
Quite the suspenseful moment.

41:41.947 --> 41:43.377
Please, proceed.

41:43.402 --> 41:44.978
Mr. Rindell...

41:45.212 --> 41:46.564
good morning.

41:46.589 --> 41:48.049
Good morning.

41:48.556 --> 41:51.822
What did Michael Kresteva
offer you in exchange

41:51.847 --> 41:53.947
for your grand jury testimony?

41:58.048 --> 42:00.127
What are you looking at him for?

42:01.830 --> 42:04.166
I wasn't sure of the question.

42:04.191 --> 42:05.400
Well, then, look at me.

42:05.425 --> 42:07.714
What did Michael Kresteva
offer you in exchange

42:07.739 --> 42:09.517
for your grand jury testimony?

42:17.793 --> 42:19.707
He said he would recommend to the judge

42:19.732 --> 42:24.340
a sentence of ten years
instead of life without parole.

42:25.738 --> 42:27.379
ELSBETH: No further questions.

42:28.146 --> 42:30.645
(phones ringing, indistinct chatter)

42:31.029 --> 42:33.524
I had no idea of the plea deal.

42:33.549 --> 42:35.715
No, I did not authorize it.

42:35.997 --> 42:39.113
Yes, Senator, I
understand you lost money.

42:39.138 --> 42:41.277
WOMAN: I've got the
<i>Sun-Times</i> on line one.

42:41.302 --> 42:42.841
Tell them no comment.

42:42.866 --> 42:44.575
WOMAN: And Mike Kresteva's here.

42:44.600 --> 42:48.059
Have him come in and hold my calls.

42:48.084 --> 42:50.152
(machine whirring)

42:50.177 --> 42:52.144
- (whirring stops)
- Oh. Aah.

42:53.216 --> 42:54.442
(machine starts, stops)

42:54.467 --> 42:55.965
Yes. No.

42:56.473 --> 42:57.659
(sighs)

42:57.684 --> 42:59.855
(machine starts, stops)

43:01.785 --> 43:03.855
So that's what that does.

43:03.880 --> 43:05.379
Congratulations.

43:05.404 --> 43:06.813
What for?

43:06.838 --> 43:08.895
I was just relieved of my duties.

43:08.920 --> 43:10.629
(chuckles): You're kidding.

43:10.654 --> 43:12.823
I mean, I'm sorry.

43:12.848 --> 43:14.910
Here you go. Little present for you.

43:14.935 --> 43:16.559
Oh, and I didn't get you anything.

43:16.584 --> 43:18.988
Yes, and let's keep it that way.

43:19.459 --> 43:23.004
Well, I'm just happy it's over.

43:23.029 --> 43:25.442
- That's funny.
- What is?

43:25.467 --> 43:28.910
Oh, I just think it's funny
that you think this is over.

43:31.580 --> 43:33.223
- Here you go.
- (machine starts)

43:35.314 --> 43:37.286
(machine stops)

43:38.909 --> 43:40.368
(gasps)

43:40.455 --> 43:42.122
