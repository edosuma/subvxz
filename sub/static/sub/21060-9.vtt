-* Whatcha want,

-Heads up!

00:21.033 --> 00:23.500
-* Bad boys, bad boys,

00:23.533 --> 00:25.933
I smoked some marijuana!
I'm a marijuana smoker!

00:25.967 --> 00:27.800
-* Bad boys, bad boys *
-Crawl out!

00:27.833 --> 00:29.200

-Hands up! Hands up!

00:30.467 --> 00:32.333
Hold it! Hold it!
Hold it! Hold it!

00:32.367 --> 00:34.400
-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.433 --> 00:36.500
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.533 --> 00:39.067
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:39.100 --> 00:40.800
in a court of law.

00:42.533 --> 00:46.467
-Policeman: Uh, our unit
typically rides two people
to a car.

00:46.500 --> 00:50.267
Uh, I've been riding with Jeff
for the past, almost,
eight years now.

00:50.300 --> 00:53.067
It really helps out.
We have two sets of eyes.

00:53.100 --> 00:55.800
As I'm driving around
or if Jeff's driving around,

00:55.833 --> 00:58.767
the other person can be
lookin' around and just
kinda keepin' an eye out

00:58.800 --> 01:00.400
for what's goin' on.

01:01.667 --> 01:03.300
-Hey, we're gonna go out
with this guy up here.

01:03.333 --> 01:05.067
Uh, matches the description
of somebody

01:05.067 --> 01:06.433
that the maintenance man
was saying

01:06.467 --> 01:10.633
was loitering in front
of the complex
and causin' problems.

01:10.667 --> 01:13.233
And we're just gonna go out
and see what's up with him.

01:13.267 --> 01:16.300
Oh, he's just pickin' stuff up.

01:16.333 --> 01:18.067
-Hey, guy, come here real quick.
-Why?

01:18.067 --> 01:20.167
-'Cause you're walkin'
in the road.

01:20.200 --> 01:21.633
-(man shouts indistinctly)

01:24.733 --> 01:27.533
-North 27, foot pursuit.

01:28.800 --> 01:30.200
On the ground.

01:30.233 --> 01:32.900
Get on the ground!
-Get on the ground!

01:32.933 --> 01:34.533
-Man (over radio):
Where you at?

01:35.600 --> 01:38.067
-We're at
five-four-three Bethany.

01:38.100 --> 01:39.933
-(Taser crackling)

01:45.900 --> 01:47.300
Get on the ground!

01:47.333 --> 01:49.300
-(siren approaching)

01:54.333 --> 01:56.567
-Don, he's goin' through
the parkin' lot.

01:56.600 --> 01:58.900
-(panting)

01:58.933 --> 02:01.900
-Man (over radio):
I'm at four-four, four-five.

02:01.933 --> 02:05.433
-Right in here.
Go to that west parkin' lot.

02:07.533 --> 02:09.267
-White male!

02:09.300 --> 02:11.467
-Where's he at?
-Shorts?

02:11.500 --> 02:13.400
-No. Pajama pants.
-Pajama pants!

02:13.433 --> 02:16.233
White male,
pajama pants and shirt.

02:16.267 --> 02:18.700
Jacket.
-(siren blares)

02:18.733 --> 02:21.167
-He was comin' this way.
-Hey, let's just backtrack
this way.

02:21.200 --> 02:24.667
-Over there.
-Man (over radio): It's a white
male, white shirt, jeans?

02:24.700 --> 02:27.567
-They found it, the bag
and his shirt in the alleyway.

02:27.600 --> 02:28.767
-Did you get him with it?

02:28.800 --> 02:30.200
-Huh?
-Did you get him with it?

02:30.233 --> 02:32.900
-Yeah, I got him, but I think
only one probably hooked.

02:32.933 --> 02:34.967
-Dude, I don't know.

02:35.067 --> 02:37.867
-Help me check his bag.

02:37.900 --> 02:39.700
-This is, uh...

02:39.733 --> 02:43.067
It's the bag that the male
subject that was-- wearin' it
that ran from us was had.

02:43.100 --> 02:46.400
So I wanted to go see,
see if he had any drugs in it.

02:46.433 --> 02:49.633
Give us another reason
why he decided to run.

02:49.667 --> 02:51.567
Just looks like dirty laundry.

02:54.567 --> 03:00.767
-Hey, Sarge, if it means
anything, we didn't find any
237-Nora in his property.

03:00.800 --> 03:04.067
-Um, DOC.

03:04.067 --> 03:07.067
-Hey, and he's got a DOC
ID card that we just found.

03:07.067 --> 03:09.300
We're gonna try to see
if he has a 51.

03:10.967 --> 03:13.267
-Man (over radio):
Hey, Mike, uh, K-9's here.

03:13.300 --> 03:18.367
-Hey, his name is Christopher.
He's got a 51 out of DOC,
parole violation.

03:18.400 --> 03:22.967
-Felony warrant
out of Department
of Corrections.

03:23.067 --> 03:24.400
That's the reason
why he ran.

03:24.433 --> 03:26.500
-Man (over radio):
Thank you.
-Yep.

03:28.067 --> 03:32.367
-(man screaming)

03:32.400 --> 03:36.567
(screaming continuing)

03:36.600 --> 03:38.600
-Let me see your hands!
-Put your hands out!

03:38.633 --> 03:42.433
-Put your hands out!
-(screaming)

03:42.467 --> 03:44.767
-Roll over!
-Hands behind your back!

03:44.800 --> 03:46.067
-Roll over!
-Hands behind your back!

03:46.067 --> 03:47.300
-Behind your back!

03:47.333 --> 03:51.133
-(groaning)

03:51.167 --> 03:52.867
-(barking)

03:52.900 --> 03:58.433
-(groaning)
-Roll up on your left side!
Roll up on your left side!

04:02.967 --> 04:04.867
Stand up. Stand up!

04:04.900 --> 04:06.200
-Stand up!
-Stand up!

04:08.133 --> 04:10.333
-You'll be okay.
Sit down right there.

04:10.367 --> 04:12.467
There you go.
Just relax.

04:13.667 --> 04:14.967
Okay?

04:15.067 --> 04:17.767
-What's your name?
-Christopher.

04:17.800 --> 04:20.167
-You know
you have a warrant, right?

04:20.200 --> 04:22.200
Is that why you ran?

04:22.233 --> 04:24.800
-Yeah, he told me
he's an absconder.
-Where have you been bitten at?

04:24.833 --> 04:26.600
-My neck.
-And where else?

04:26.633 --> 04:27.800
-That's it.

04:27.833 --> 04:29.900
-You know, it hurts,
but it's nothin' serious.

04:29.933 --> 04:32.700
We're gonna have
the fire department come
tell you it's nothin' serious.

04:32.733 --> 04:34.267
How long were you hidin'
in those bushes?

04:34.300 --> 04:37.433
-Since I ran over here.
-Did you think you weren't
gonna get found?

04:37.467 --> 04:40.200
-I was hoping not.
-Wanna go get checked out
real quick?

04:40.233 --> 04:42.800
-Yeah.
-I'm gonna stand you up, bud.
You gotta walk though, okay?

04:42.833 --> 04:45.100
-The probe is still
in his his elbow, guys.
-Yep.

04:47.067 --> 04:48.767
-Hey, you're pretty fast, man.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.100
-Do you guys have any water?
-Yeah. We'll get you the water.

04:51.133 --> 04:52.333
-Have a seat right here.

04:57.533 --> 04:59.433
-What's the deal, man?
Why'd you run?

04:59.467 --> 05:02.133
-I absconded parole.

05:02.167 --> 05:03.833
-How long you been
on the run for?

05:03.867 --> 05:08.200
-Uh, I been out close
to a month, a little over
a month.

05:08.233 --> 05:09.967
-What'd you do to abscond?

05:10.067 --> 05:12.433
Just didn't check in
with your parole officer
or what?

05:12.467 --> 05:15.100
-I got kicked out of my
halfway house.

05:15.133 --> 05:18.733
-Yeah?
-And never checked in,
told them.

05:18.767 --> 05:21.167
-Why didn't you just tell us
right up front that you
had a warrant?

05:21.200 --> 05:24.367
We would've taken care
of it a lot easier than
gettin' bit by a dog.

05:24.400 --> 05:28.200
-(bleep) yeah.
-Why didn't you just
tell us up front, bro?

05:28.233 --> 05:30.367
I didn't think about that.

05:32.333 --> 05:38.067
And I'm bein' dead honest.
I did not think that (bleep) dog
was gonna get me like that.

05:38.067 --> 05:39.867
-You ever been bit before?

05:39.900 --> 05:43.967
-In the leg by a little
(bleeping) dog.

05:44.067 --> 05:46.233
-Dude, all we wanted
to talk to you about
was just walkin' down

05:46.267 --> 05:48.300
the middle of the street.
That's it, man.

05:48.333 --> 05:51.067
-Yeah, but at the end
of the day, at the end
of that talk

05:51.067 --> 05:52.433
I was still goin' to prison.

05:52.467 --> 05:54.767
-Yeah, but how much time
do you have left to do
on your warrant?

05:54.800 --> 05:56.700
-Seven months.
-Seven months?

05:56.733 --> 05:58.967
-(groans)
-Is that the only place he got?

05:59.067 --> 06:03.067
-That's it, Taser
probe in the right arm,
and then a dog bite

06:03.067 --> 06:04.867
up in the...
-He got Tased?

06:04.900 --> 06:06.733
-Yeah.
Well, one probe, yeah.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.133
-So you-- you heard
announcements,

06:08.167 --> 06:09.767
you just didn't know
what they were sayin'?

06:09.800 --> 06:12.500
-Yes.
-So, why wouldn't you surrender
to those announcements, though?

06:12.533 --> 06:15.200
-What? The same reason
I didn't surrender to you guys

06:15.233 --> 06:18.067
when I was runnin'
on Bethany Home.
-Why's that?

06:18.067 --> 06:19.800
-Because I was tryin'
to get away.

06:19.833 --> 06:21.200
-So you're just runnin'
for your freedom?

06:21.233 --> 06:25.100
-Yeah.
I didn't hear...
what you said specifically.

06:25.133 --> 06:26.833
-But you knew
we were police, right?
-Yes.

06:26.867 --> 06:28.200
-You knew it was
a police dog.
-Yes.

06:28.233 --> 06:30.667
-So, once you saw
the police dog,
why didn't you say--

06:30.700 --> 06:33.167
-Once I seen the dog
in my face, yes, I knew
it was a police dog.

06:33.200 --> 06:35.467
-But you had to see us
walk by you the first time.

06:35.500 --> 06:37.200
-No.
-What were you doin'?

06:37.233 --> 06:39.967
-Closin' your eyes,
so we don't see you,
you don't see me?

06:40.067 --> 06:42.800
-I was... I was
tryin' to breathe.

06:42.833 --> 06:45.067
-Okay.
-It's hard to see
out of those leaves. I'm--

06:45.067 --> 06:46.967
-Okay.
-It was just a bitch
and a half all the way around.

06:47.067 --> 06:49.267
-So you couldn't
see us very well?
-No, I couldn't see (bleep).

06:49.300 --> 06:50.700
-We couldn't
see you, right?
-Yes.

06:50.733 --> 06:52.767
-Okay.
Well, do me a favor.
The next time

06:52.800 --> 06:54.267
you hear the warning,
simply give up.

06:54.300 --> 06:56.333
'Cause now I gotta
write a ton of paperwork.
-You bet your ass.

06:56.367 --> 06:58.467
-All right, buddy.
Good luck to you, Chris.

07:01.833 --> 07:06.300
-Policeman: I'm still out here
on patrol in my 12th year
because, uh, it's still fun.

07:06.333 --> 07:08.767
Patrol, specifically
in the police department,

07:08.800 --> 07:12.067
is kind of the forward action,
we're the forward element.

07:12.100 --> 07:15.100
At times we're nothing more
than triage, and we keep people

07:15.133 --> 07:17.800
from doin' the worst things
they could think of
to themselves.

07:17.833 --> 07:20.567
And other times we get in
on the ground floor
of an investigation

07:20.600 --> 07:22.067
that's really gonna change
somebody's life,

07:22.067 --> 07:23.900
and help somebody tremendously.

07:26.567 --> 07:30.467
Uh, we got-- we got a report
over here that there was a car
parked at a corner,

07:30.500 --> 07:32.467
and um, a guy and a gal
were havin' a fight

07:32.500 --> 07:37.100
in there, and in the meantime,
we've been told that it may
have moved to a specific address

07:37.133 --> 07:40.800
and there's a, uh, fight
going on out in the front yard.

07:40.833 --> 07:42.167
Yeah, right there.

07:50.500 --> 07:53.300
-(thumping)
-Woman: Let go of my leg!

07:55.567 --> 07:58.633
-28 Adam, get me another car.

07:58.667 --> 08:00.733
-(indistinct radio transmission)

08:00.767 --> 08:02.100
-(woman yelling indistinctly)

08:02.133 --> 08:03.133
(door rattling)

08:06.067 --> 08:08.067
-Police! Open up!

08:09.900 --> 08:12.667
-(indistinct radio transmission)

08:12.700 --> 08:14.267
-Police! Open up!

08:14.300 --> 08:16.067
-(door rattles)

08:17.367 --> 08:19.333
-Hands! Everybody's hands! Now!

08:19.367 --> 08:21.200
Step out!

08:21.233 --> 08:22.400
Who else is here?

08:22.433 --> 08:24.367
-Just us.
-Sit!

08:28.367 --> 08:30.633
28 Adam, no hold.
I got 'em.

08:30.667 --> 08:32.133
Get up.

08:32.167 --> 08:34.067
-(indistinct radio transmission)

08:35.733 --> 08:36.800
-No.

08:39.400 --> 08:42.067
-(indistinct
radio transmissions)

08:47.867 --> 08:49.867
-Stand right here,
don't move, do you
understand me?

08:49.900 --> 08:52.367
-Yes, sir.
You move, what's gonna happen?
I'm gonna catch ya.

08:52.400 --> 08:53.833
Anything on you
you're not supposed to have?

08:53.867 --> 08:55.067
-No, sir.

08:55.100 --> 08:56.733
-Woman (over radio):
28 Adam, are you
at that address,

08:56.767 --> 09:01.467
1406 East 27th?
-I am. It was goin' good
when I got here.

09:01.500 --> 09:04.467
I got 'em out, I got 'em
separated, and I got one
cuffed up.

09:04.500 --> 09:07.067
Nobody's gotta run hot.
Everything's cool.

09:07.067 --> 09:09.733
So, why do I drive up here
and it sounds like somebody's
gettin' the hell

09:09.767 --> 09:11.233
beat out of 'em inside there?

09:11.267 --> 09:12.700
-'Cause, I mean, uh,
we're in there yellin',

09:12.733 --> 09:14.400
but nobody's--
nobody's in there
gettin' beat.

09:14.433 --> 09:16.400
-Nobody's gettin' beat
and I can hear it
through the windows,

09:16.433 --> 09:18.067
and the doors,
and everything's
slammin' around.

09:18.067 --> 09:20.200
-'Cause we're yellin'.
I walked outside,
took my laundry basket.

09:20.233 --> 09:21.933
-You tryin' to leave,
is that the deal?

09:21.967 --> 09:24.767
-I mean, I don't--
-You don't have any ID
on you today?

09:24.800 --> 09:26.500
-Uh, yeah, should be
in my wallet.

09:28.800 --> 09:31.367
-If it's not in my pocket--
-I didn't see your wallet
in there, brother.

09:31.400 --> 09:35.267
-It might be in my car, then.
-Why is your wallet in the car,
not in your--

09:35.300 --> 09:38.167
-That's just-- I--
sometimes keep-- I don't--
I got basketball shorts on,

09:38.200 --> 09:39.667
I don't wanna lose it.
-I can deal with that.

09:39.700 --> 09:42.067
Lean up against that fence,
don't go nowhere.

09:43.167 --> 09:44.967
What's your story today,
young lady?

09:45.067 --> 09:47.467
-Just, been non-stop arguin'.
-About what?

09:47.500 --> 09:51.633
-Uh, everything, about
me talkin' to people
on Facebook, and...

09:51.667 --> 09:54.100
-It sounds like stuff
was gettin' tossed around
pretty good inside there.

09:54.133 --> 09:56.300
-He was throwin' baskets
and throwin' (bleep) and...

09:56.333 --> 09:57.500
-Stuff get thrown at you?
-No.

09:57.533 --> 09:59.600
Just at the front door, and...

09:59.633 --> 10:01.167
-Did he put his hands
on you at all?

10:01.200 --> 10:03.133
-We just-- No,
we just need to be separated.

10:03.167 --> 10:05.067
-Okay, well, that's not
what I'm askin'.
-No.

10:05.100 --> 10:06.333
-'Cause there
are troublesome things.

10:06.367 --> 10:07.967
How'd you get
that blood on your shirt
right here?

10:10.133 --> 10:13.433
-I don't know.
-You've got blood on your shirt,
and your clothes

10:13.467 --> 10:16.733
obviously indicate
that you've been in some sort
of physical confrontation.

10:18.300 --> 10:20.600
And I'm here to help you.

10:20.633 --> 10:21.833
But you have to tell me
the truth.

10:21.867 --> 10:23.267
Okay? So I'm waitin'
for another officer

10:23.300 --> 10:25.267
that's gonna arrive, and then
we're gonna figure this out.

10:25.300 --> 10:26.567
Hang on for me.

10:27.867 --> 10:29.933
You guys ever been
in the mix before?

10:29.967 --> 10:33.100
Guys never had the cops here?
-No. I haven't been--I would
never put my hands on her.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.100
-Lift your head up.
What happened to your throat
right there?

10:35.133 --> 10:36.600
-It's from shavin'.
-That's from shavin'?

10:36.633 --> 10:39.233
-Yeah, either that or
I was just vacuumin' my car.

10:39.267 --> 10:41.333
You can go look
at my car right now.
I was vacuumin' my car.

10:41.367 --> 10:43.633
-How'd she get blood
on her shirt?

10:43.667 --> 10:46.833
I-- I-- I haven't hit her
or nothin', I mean, unless
it's from my neck,

10:46.867 --> 10:49.367
but it wasn't fightin'.
-Why would she get blood
from your neck on her shirt?

10:49.400 --> 10:51.567
-When I was--
'Cause I had my arms
around her back, and we're--

10:51.600 --> 10:54.200
and I was from behind her,
and we was-- We ain't been
fightin' the whole time,

10:54.233 --> 10:55.833
we just started fightin'
(bleep) 10 minutes ago.

10:55.867 --> 10:58.000
-So why'd you have your arms
around her and have her
from behind?

10:58.033 --> 10:59.767
-'Cause it's my old lady,
I mean, it's-- it's not--

10:59.800 --> 11:01.633
-Okay, and then you started
fightin' after doin' that?

11:01.667 --> 11:03.367
-No, we's arguin'
after that.

11:03.400 --> 11:05.867
Everything was all good,
and then all of a sudden
everything just went real bad

11:05.900 --> 11:07.733
because of a stupid-ass argument
over Facebook.
-28 Adam.

11:07.767 --> 11:10.467
-It's petty, it's stupid,
it's dumb. I mean,
you got a hundred thousand

11:10.500 --> 11:13.067
better things to be doin'
besides this right now.
-Donald, I really just--

11:13.100 --> 11:16.100
I gotta be honest with you,
man, I don't believe you.
You know why I don't

11:16.133 --> 11:18.700
believe you? 'Cause you got big
scratch marks down your chest.

11:18.733 --> 11:20.867
-You see all these
big-ass holes, 'cause
we got these big-ass dog,

11:20.900 --> 11:23.333
could be from the dog,
'cause the dog was in there
just jumpin' on me, too.

11:23.367 --> 11:25.800
-What kinda dog you got?
-It's a German--
German shepherd, ain't it?

11:25.833 --> 11:27.767
-(radio chatter)
-Great Dane.

11:27.800 --> 11:29.333
-Great Dane.
And he's in a kennel?

11:29.367 --> 11:33.833
-(radio chatter)
-Hang out with Donald
for a minute.

11:33.867 --> 11:35.867
Tell me what happened.
He can't hear you,
he can't see you,

11:35.900 --> 11:39.067
no one else is around.
It's just you and me.

11:39.067 --> 11:40.633
Tell me how
it all started today.

11:40.667 --> 11:46.300
Terrific, Facebook
and passwords and...
It's an argument every day.

11:46.333 --> 11:50.367
-Okay.
He told me he had his hands
around you... from...

11:50.400 --> 11:51.633
-And wouldn't let me go, yeah.

11:51.667 --> 11:53.267
-He had his hands around you
and wouldn't let you go?

11:53.300 --> 11:56.067
-That's what we were
yellin' about outside,
I told him to get off me.

11:56.067 --> 11:58.967
-Okay.
So he did put his hands
on you today.

11:59.067 --> 12:00.300
Correct?

12:00.333 --> 12:02.833
Did he put his hands
on you outside?

12:02.867 --> 12:05.467
And-- And let me--
Before I ask you
that question,

12:05.500 --> 12:08.500
you have to understand why.
Why do you think I think

12:08.533 --> 12:11.100
he put his hands
on you outside?

12:13.500 --> 12:15.333
What do you think
brought me here today?

12:15.367 --> 12:17.200
-Neighbors?
-Mm-hm.

12:17.233 --> 12:21.433
Because they called in
and said that they'd seen him
throw you to the ground.

12:21.467 --> 12:23.300
So that's what brought
the police here today.

12:23.333 --> 12:26.567
And that's what brought
our response to your front door
is because as I pull up,

12:26.600 --> 12:29.067
I can hear you two
in here fightin' pretty good.

12:29.067 --> 12:31.400
Okay?
The walls aren't that thick
around here.

12:31.433 --> 12:34.733
Okay?
So, knowing what
you know I know,

12:34.767 --> 12:36.767
what happened outside today?

12:38.067 --> 12:41.867
-(radio chatter)
-We got-- I don't know...

12:41.900 --> 12:43.233
Uh, he just wouldn't
let me go.

12:43.267 --> 12:45.067
-So the argument
started inside,

12:45.067 --> 12:46.500
you went outside
to escape him,

12:46.533 --> 12:48.467
and then what happened?
-He came outside and...

12:48.500 --> 12:50.200
-What did he do outside?
-...hollerin', screamin'.

12:50.233 --> 12:53.067
-Uh-huh.
-And so I stood up, and then--
I don't know. But he like...

12:53.067 --> 12:54.800
-That's fine.
-...hugged me and, like,
wouldn't let go.

12:54.833 --> 12:56.833
He's like, "Just talk to me,
just talk to me,"
and I was like,

12:56.867 --> 12:59.133
"I'm so sick, all right?
I don't wanna talk
to you right now.

12:59.167 --> 13:02.200
"I just don't wanna talk to you.
There's no point in talkin'
anymore, it's been eight years

13:02.233 --> 13:03.567
"of talking,
and nothing's different.

13:03.600 --> 13:05.967
What's-- What's
gonna be different now? And..."

13:06.067 --> 13:08.667
-Were you telling him
to let you go?

13:08.700 --> 13:10.233
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

13:10.267 --> 13:12.233
-I just don't wanna--
I don't wanna argue anymore.
-I understand.

13:12.267 --> 13:14.767
Okay. Billie, come out here,
I'm gonna have you sit
on the couch and hang out

13:14.800 --> 13:15.933
where it's nice and cool, okay?

13:19.700 --> 13:22.400
And I'm arrestin' you
for domestic assault.
I think you know

13:22.433 --> 13:25.067
what happened out here
wasn't the right thing.
And I don't think

13:25.067 --> 13:28.467
you're the cat that's gonna
roll back out and kill somebody?

13:28.500 --> 13:31.200
But, in this state,
we gotta do what we gotta do,

13:31.233 --> 13:34.300
because that's happened before.
Does that make sense?
-Yeah.

13:34.333 --> 13:37.267
-And I think that this might
actually be a little bit
of a wake-up call?

13:37.300 --> 13:40.667
You'll get this handled up,
and you guys will be
on your way, smooth sailin'.

13:40.700 --> 13:42.500
Probably take this
as a lesson learned.
Can you do that?

13:42.533 --> 13:45.867
-Yeah.
-All right. Move forward,
do the right thing, okay?

13:47.800 --> 13:50.067
-Policeman:
One of my first in-progress
calls as a rookie

13:50.100 --> 13:53.633
was a female called in
and said that she heard
glass break at her house,

13:53.667 --> 13:55.400
and she believed someone
was inside.

13:55.433 --> 13:57.700
So, uh, we get there,
and come to find out

13:57.733 --> 13:59.633
there was nobody actually
in her house.

13:59.667 --> 14:03.167
She just kind of panicked
and believed someone
was in there.

14:03.200 --> 14:06.267
Uh, after it was all
said and done, she
actually apologized.

14:06.300 --> 14:08.600
She said, "Sorry for wasting
your time," and that's
one thing

14:08.633 --> 14:11.700
that a lot of times I think
the public forgets is they're
not wastin' our time,

14:11.733 --> 14:13.300
that's what we're here for.

14:13.333 --> 14:16.200
We're here to, uh, help 'em.
Protect and serve.

14:17.567 --> 14:20.233
We just got a call
about a vehicle in the water.

14:20.267 --> 14:22.400
Uh, it's unclear
at this time if, uh,

14:22.433 --> 14:24.433
the vehicle was occupied
or not.

14:24.467 --> 14:25.800
So that's where we're
headed right now,

14:25.833 --> 14:28.433
and see, uh, what the deal is
with this vehicle.

14:28.467 --> 14:30.467
There it is right there.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.567
-(coughing)
-(radio chatter)

14:36.900 --> 14:38.467
-How you doin', sir?
You the driver?

14:38.500 --> 14:40.400
No?
-They were right in front
of me, and they just happened

14:40.433 --> 14:41.667
to drive right off.

14:41.700 --> 14:44.333
-Mm-hm.
-They were goin'
about 30 miles an hour,

14:44.367 --> 14:46.433
and he just drove
straight-- straight off into it.

14:46.467 --> 14:49.100
-Okay.
Where are they now,
they were with, uh,

14:49.133 --> 14:52.667
tell it to the deputies?
-Yeah, uh, after they got out,

14:52.700 --> 14:54.500
-Okay.
-uh, he got a hold of 'em.

14:54.533 --> 14:55.533
-Okay.

14:56.600 --> 14:58.200
You have ID with you, sir?
-Yeah.

14:58.233 --> 14:59.300
-Uh-huh.
Where's your ID?

14:59.333 --> 15:00.533
This your ID?
-Mm-hm.

15:00.567 --> 15:04.100
-Okay. (clears throat)
So what happened today?

15:04.133 --> 15:08.367
-What do you mean?
-Your vehicle's in the water.
Can you tell me what happened?

15:08.400 --> 15:10.967
-I don't know what happened.
-You was just driving,
and then--

15:11.067 --> 15:12.500
-I was takin' her home.
-Takin her home?

15:12.533 --> 15:13.667
-Yeah.
-Where?

15:13.700 --> 15:14.933
-McNair.
-Do you know where McNair is?

15:14.967 --> 15:16.600
-Yeah.
-Where's it at?

15:16.633 --> 15:17.667
-My grandma's house.

15:17.700 --> 15:19.067
-I'm sorry.
-My grandma's house.

15:19.100 --> 15:21.133
-Your grandma's house?
Your grandma's house
in McNair?

15:21.167 --> 15:22.867
-Uh-huh.
-But you know where
McNair is?

15:22.900 --> 15:24.567
-Yeah.
-Where is it at?

15:24.600 --> 15:26.067
-In McNair.
-In McNair?

15:26.067 --> 15:28.267
-Where is McNair?
-McNair.

15:28.300 --> 15:31.067
-Right.
You know what city it's in?

15:31.067 --> 15:32.667
-Uh-uh.
-You don't know where--
You know what city

15:32.700 --> 15:33.700
McNair is in?
-Uh-uh.

15:33.733 --> 15:35.600
-No?
But you were just goin' there?

15:35.633 --> 15:38.633
-Yeah.
-Okay. You thinkin' McNair
is this way?

15:38.667 --> 15:42.100
-No.
-No? So why were you
drivin' this way?

15:42.133 --> 15:44.067
-I was takin' her home.

15:44.100 --> 15:45.600
In-- In McNair, right?

15:45.633 --> 15:47.633
-Yeah.
-Okay. But McNair, that's what
I'm tryin' to tell you,

15:47.667 --> 15:49.900
McNair is not... this direction.

15:49.933 --> 15:51.733
-No, I was just goin' home.

15:51.767 --> 15:54.833
-Okay.
Have you had anything
to drink today?

15:54.867 --> 15:57.267
-It just-- I don't know
where I was going.
-Okay.

15:57.300 --> 16:00.667
The reason I'm askin',
is 'cause, well, your vehicle's

16:00.700 --> 16:02.233
in the water, and you appear

16:02.267 --> 16:04.433
to be disoriented.
-Huh?

16:04.467 --> 16:07.367
-You appear to be disoriented.
You're tellin' me you're going
to McNair,

16:07.400 --> 16:10.267
but you're travelin'
the wrong way to head to McNair.

16:10.300 --> 16:12.700
Okay?
That's the reason
why I'm askin' if you're okay.

16:12.733 --> 16:14.433
-I don't understand
what you're sayin'.

16:14.467 --> 16:15.900
-You don't understand
what I'm tellin' you?

16:15.933 --> 16:18.067
-No, sir.
-All right.
Just sit tight, okay?

16:18.100 --> 16:19.600
I'll be with you in a minute.

16:20.867 --> 16:22.800
You could hear that his speech
is slurred.

16:22.833 --> 16:26.700
I didn't get any real, uh,
smell of alcohol from--
from his breath,

16:26.733 --> 16:29.600
but it's obvious
something's wrong.
He has something in his system.

16:29.633 --> 16:32.500
Uh, just, don't know
what it is just yet.

16:32.533 --> 16:35.500
So I'm gonna do a history check
on him, and see if he's been
handled before for DWI

16:35.533 --> 16:39.833
or something, and see
what, uh, what his deal is.

16:39.867 --> 16:41.700
-How did the car
get in the water?

16:41.733 --> 16:44.300
There's not a road that goes
into the water, is what
we're tryin' to ascertain.

16:44.333 --> 16:45.900
-It just went in the water,
I-- I don't know.

16:45.933 --> 16:47.833
It just drove, I just drivin'.

16:47.867 --> 16:49.700
-Anybody else in that car?
-Nobody else.

16:49.733 --> 16:50.967
-No, just you two?
-Yes.

16:51.067 --> 16:52.267
-You sure?
-Yes, sir.

16:52.300 --> 16:53.300
-All right. How about you?

16:53.333 --> 16:54.567
You know of anybody else
in that car?

16:54.600 --> 16:57.767
-No.
-No? Just you two?

16:57.800 --> 17:00.067
Just you two?
Are you sure?

17:00.067 --> 17:01.200
-Yeah.
-Okay.

17:01.233 --> 17:03.867
Where you guys headed to?
-I'm goin' home.

17:03.900 --> 17:05.933
-You were goin' home,
from where?

17:05.967 --> 17:07.600
-McNair.
-From McNair?

17:07.633 --> 17:09.500
-Yeah.
-You weren't going to McNair?

17:09.533 --> 17:10.600
Where do you live?

17:10.633 --> 17:12.467
-I live on-- on Golf Street.

17:12.500 --> 17:15.667
-On where?
-It's on my arm.

17:15.700 --> 17:17.233
-Your address
is on your arm?

17:17.267 --> 17:18.967
-Yes, sir.
-Let me see your arm.

17:23.400 --> 17:24.967
It just says "Tanika."

17:25.067 --> 17:28.533
-What's your name?
-Look. I can't-- Uncuff me,
I can show you.

17:28.567 --> 17:29.967
-What's your name?

17:30.067 --> 17:31.800
-Ma'am?
Where are you headed to?

17:31.833 --> 17:33.500
-Home.
-Home?

17:33.533 --> 17:34.667
-Where's home?

17:37.900 --> 17:40.200
-Home.

17:40.233 --> 17:43.167
-He don't have any priors
for DWI. He has one
resisting arrest,

17:43.200 --> 17:45.067
that's the only thing
he's been charged with.
-Yeah.

17:45.100 --> 17:46.733
His driver's license is good?
-No.

17:46.767 --> 17:49.467
-No? Okay, so he--
-He's under the influence
of somethin'.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.333
Go ahead and do the, uh...
-Do the deal? Okay.

17:51.367 --> 17:54.067
And at the--
at the very least, DWLS?
-Yes, definitely.

17:54.067 --> 17:55.767
-Okay. All righty.

17:58.167 --> 18:01.900
-Yeah, well, she's takin'
his vitals right now.
Make sure he's-- he's okay.

18:01.933 --> 18:04.767
Just a precaution, make sure
that everything's fine,
and then I'll take him down

18:04.800 --> 18:07.367
to our station.
So, if you want to take care
of the accident,

18:07.400 --> 18:09.300
and I'll take care
of the rest?
-Okay.

18:09.333 --> 18:11.700
-Uh-huh.
You wanna go ahead
and put them...

18:11.733 --> 18:14.100
her in your vehicle,
we'll take 'em over
to the station.

18:14.133 --> 18:17.500
And then we'll take him
in one of the other vehicles
as well.

18:17.533 --> 18:19.767
-All right.
Come on, ma'am.

18:19.800 --> 18:23.800
-All right, let's go ahead
and get all your stuff
over here.

18:23.833 --> 18:27.633
It's-- It's inclement weather,
but I really doubt that
the weather had anything

18:27.667 --> 18:29.600
to do with it.
-Yeah, it wasn't so bad
as to where...

18:29.633 --> 18:31.100
-No.
-You know, no.

18:31.133 --> 18:33.500
I think, high rate of speed,
under the influence
of somethin'.

18:33.533 --> 18:38.733
Also, uh, there's a pill bottle,
and it's full of pills.
We're not sure what it is.

18:38.767 --> 18:40.300
-Is this Vicodin?
-I'm not sure.

18:40.333 --> 18:41.833
-No, it's ibu--
-Huh?

18:41.867 --> 18:45.500
-Ibuprofen?
That's what it says
on the bottle, ibuprofen.

18:46.533 --> 18:48.200
-Good thing is nobody's hurt.

18:48.233 --> 18:50.667
Um, he did
a best he could check.

18:50.700 --> 18:52.100
Make sure there's--
-Nobody else in there?

18:52.133 --> 18:54.433
-Yeah.
When it comes up here,
and it drains out a little bit,

18:54.467 --> 18:56.167
we'll-- we'll check it again,
just to make sure.

18:56.200 --> 18:58.600
-That's why I was
kinda concerned. I didn't know
if maybe they had a child

18:58.633 --> 19:00.400
in there or...
-Yeah. Yeah.

19:00.433 --> 19:02.467
There's no tellin'.

19:04.733 --> 19:06.367
-You were the first ones here?
-Right.

19:06.400 --> 19:09.133
-Okay.
-When I got here, the water
was up to, I guess,

19:09.167 --> 19:11.700
the bottom of the door.
Uh, they were sittin' in there,

19:11.733 --> 19:15.667
and uh, they were
real disoriented,
for whatever reason.

19:15.700 --> 19:18.667
And, uh, the female finally
got out, walked around
the back.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.500
They helped her out
of the water.

19:20.533 --> 19:25.400
Uh, as I was gettin' him out,
uh, she was so disoriented,

19:25.433 --> 19:28.233
she didn't know where she was.
She was tryin' to walk away
from the scene.

19:28.267 --> 19:32.433
So, uh, detained her.
As I was bringin' her back
to where we were,

19:32.467 --> 19:36.933
uh, he started walkin' off,
so he was detained also...
-So they were both kinda

19:36.967 --> 19:38.867
wanted to walk away
from the scene.
-Right. Yeah, they were

19:38.900 --> 19:40.300
very incoherent,
very disoriented.

19:40.333 --> 19:42.067
-Yeah, he's definitely
under the influence
of somethin'.

19:42.067 --> 19:43.767
He kept sayin'
he was goin' to McNair.
-Right, right.

19:43.800 --> 19:45.467
-You know, that's east,
and he's turnin' south,

19:45.500 --> 19:48.133
and he's still, like you said
earlier, he's not even sure
what happened.

19:48.167 --> 19:49.367
-Correct.

19:49.400 --> 19:52.100
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:52.133 --> 19:54.067
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:54.100 --> 19:55.233
Cover is code three.

19:55.267 --> 19:58.233
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:04.000 --> 20:06.967
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:07.000 --> 20:11.800
-(theme music playing)
