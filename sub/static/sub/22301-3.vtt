09:03.167 --> 09:04.794
Yes, right there

09:04.877 --> 09:06.378
and right there,

09:06.462 --> 09:07.797
and there.

09:48.295 --> 09:50.214
-Agustine, are you doing all right?
-Yes.

09:50.297 --> 09:52.925
If anything happens,
just drop that shit, let it all burn.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.260
Don't worry.

13:20.424 --> 13:23.385
<i>One of the things I like the most,</i>
<i>and I always tell Francis,</i>

13:23.469 --> 13:26.555
it's the possibility to work in fresh air.

13:27.348 --> 13:29.641
<i>Because we work in fresh air,</i>

13:29.725 --> 13:32.478
<i>we have to work with the wind,</i>

13:32.561 --> 13:34.646
<i>we have to work with the rain,</i>

13:34.730 --> 13:36.565
<i>we have to work with the snow.</i>

13:43.530 --> 13:47.451
Francis has an energy to materialize

13:47.534 --> 13:51.830
<i>a person with ideas</i>
<i>that also accomplishes what he dreams.</i>

14:07.346 --> 14:10.724
<i>It has shown me</i>
<i>that practically nothing is impossible.</i>

14:12.518 --> 14:15.146
And that's why I would love
to continue working with him.

14:28.242 --> 14:31.578
We drank three of these bottles already.

21:48.056 --> 21:50.559
Come here, Heloisa.

21:51.602 --> 21:53.520
-Come, my love.
-Daddy?

22:15.000 --> 22:16.585
Don't let it go.

22:18.504 --> 22:20.130
Again.

22:20.213 --> 22:21.465
Now we drink a little bit.

22:22.633 --> 22:23.759
The smell...

22:24.760 --> 22:26.052
delicious smell.

22:27.638 --> 22:29.640
What does it smell like?
Does it smell like ass?

22:29.723 --> 22:33.477
A loved ass? A healthy ass?

22:33.560 --> 22:37.439
-"It smells like ass, Dad."
-Don't teach her that, I beg of you!

22:40.984 --> 22:42.403
Again but with both--

24:06.903 --> 24:10.281
"I have dreamed of you so much
that you are no longer real.

24:11.575 --> 24:15.453
Is there still time for me
to reach your breathing body,

24:15.537 --> 24:18.582
to kiss your mouth and make

24:18.665 --> 24:21.167
your dear voice come alive again?

24:22.210 --> 24:24.129
I have dreamed of you so much
that my arms,

24:24.212 --> 24:26.757
grown used to being
crossed on my chest

24:26.840 --> 24:30.511
as I hugged your shadow,

24:30.594 --> 24:33.805
would not bend
to the shape of your body,

24:33.889 --> 24:35.599
perhaps."

26:06.356 --> 26:07.691
You like it?

26:07.774 --> 26:11.194
Let me put some on your finger,
let's see your finger.

26:15.949 --> 26:17.743
Eat it.

27:24.600 --> 27:26.019
Alex, do you want to look at this?

27:26.102 --> 27:28.689
-Yes, where?
-On this couch.

27:29.731 --> 27:30.774
Do you remember this?

27:30.857 --> 27:32.901
Of course I remember.
Come on, let's see it.

28:13.984 --> 28:15.610
Princess!

28:23.994 --> 28:25.703
How does Luna sleep?

28:25.787 --> 28:27.038
Show me.

28:33.169 --> 28:34.880
I don't want her to grow up.

28:35.839 --> 28:37.758
And she turns in her sleep?

28:38.549 --> 28:39.718
Hello.

28:40.676 --> 28:41.762
How are you?

28:43.596 --> 28:47.350
Alma, what are you drinking,
white or red?

28:47.433 --> 28:48.935
Red?
