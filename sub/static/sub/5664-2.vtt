00:02.287 --> 00:04.362
Special Agent with the FBI.

00:04.363 --> 00:06.167
You joined the federal police.

00:06.168 --> 00:08.908
<i>ABBIE: The city sold the
building to developers.</i>

00:08.909 --> 00:11.285
It's scheduled for demolition next month.

00:11.286 --> 00:13.983
This chamber has stood since the 1750s!

00:14.105 --> 00:15.913
<i>JENNY: I'm realizing something.</i>

00:16.001 --> 00:17.955
I stole a lot of stuff.

00:17.956 --> 00:19.991
It's too bad "supernatural
relic hunter" isn't something

00:19.992 --> 00:21.325
that looks good on a résumé.

00:21.326 --> 00:22.960
CRANE: Joe Corbin.

00:22.961 --> 00:24.162
Sheriff Corbin's son.

00:24.163 --> 00:25.763
My dad died protecting people.

00:25.764 --> 00:27.832
I'd like to carry on that
torch, if you'll help me.

00:27.833 --> 00:29.600
Betsy Ross? The flag woman?

00:31.236 --> 00:32.937
Betsy was a woman of many talents.

00:32.938 --> 00:33.938
ABBIE: Betsy and Crane

00:33.939 --> 00:35.339
kind of were a thing.

00:35.340 --> 00:37.141
This can't be us, right?

00:37.142 --> 00:39.243
This tablet means something.
Something important.

I thought your... unmentionables

01:25.224 --> 01:26.991
were in the hand washing basket.

Your hand washing basket, not my hands.

01:29.461 --> 01:31.195
Why are you doing any of my laundry

01:31.196 --> 01:32.497
in the first place, Crane?

01:32.498 --> 01:33.831
As you were kind enough

01:33.832 --> 01:35.066
to offer me a room

01:35.067 --> 01:37.168
until I found my own residence,

01:37.169 --> 01:39.303
I thought I should do
something to repay you.

01:39.304 --> 01:41.472
So I tidied, top to bottom,

01:41.473 --> 01:43.708
prepared a meal... you're
in for a treat, there.

01:43.709 --> 01:47.378
Half the colonial army were

01:47.379 --> 01:49.313

01:54.052 --> 01:56.253
Oh, hell's teeth!

01:59.725 --> 02:02.193
Our first week as roommates

02:02.194 --> 02:03.861
and I've befouled the kitchen.

02:03.862 --> 02:06.010
If we found a way to put
the brakes on the Apocalypse,

02:06.011 --> 02:07.198
we can make this work.

02:07.199 --> 02:09.066
I had roommates in college.

02:09.067 --> 02:12.203
It's all about respecting
boundaries, Crane.

02:12.204 --> 02:14.672
As Ben Franklin was wont to say,

02:14.673 --> 02:17.241
"Love thy neighbor, yet
don't pull down your hedge."

02:17.242 --> 02:19.644
Yeah. Good fences make good neighbors.

02:19.645 --> 02:21.712
And in this case,

02:21.713 --> 02:23.247
if you can't stand the heat,

02:23.248 --> 02:26.017
use somebody else's kitchen.

02:27.819 --> 02:29.554
Takeout.

02:29.555 --> 02:32.189
Capital idea.

02:35.460 --> 02:38.095
Reach for the sun, my little one.

02:38.096 --> 02:42.967
Reach for the sun and smile.

02:42.968 --> 02:45.336
Soon you'll have the fear you need to grow.

02:53.278 --> 02:56.881
From the depths of the darkness inside you.

02:56.882 --> 03:00.117
Will you bring forth the evil I desire?

03:01.486 --> 03:03.587

an accountant at the comptroller's office.

- Was.

06:31.263 --> 06:33.297
Until 24 hours ago.

06:33.298 --> 06:35.299
Oh, the Bureau thinks we need extra bodies

vet Granger's replacement?

06:37.469 --> 06:39.303
No, actually.

06:39.304 --> 06:40.437
I am the replacement.

06:42.174 --> 06:43.674
You're the new regional chief?

06:46.845 --> 06:49.346
(quietly): Wow.

06:49.347 --> 06:50.748
(Crane clears throat)

06:50.749 --> 06:52.783
My name is Ichabod Crane.

06:52.784 --> 06:55.786
I consulted for the
sheriff's department last year

06:55.787 --> 06:58.355

Agent Daniel Reynolds.

06:59.357 --> 07:00.624
Agent Mills and I

07:00.625 --> 07:03.093

07:03.094 --> 07:05.496
Not sure there's much historical relevance

07:05.497 --> 07:07.498

dying of a heart attack.

07:07.499 --> 07:09.300
Lieutenant... Agent Mills and I

07:09.301 --> 07:11.735

07:11.736 --> 07:14.271

Oh. I see.

07:16.942 --> 07:18.342
You two...

07:18.343 --> 07:20.344

07:20.345 --> 07:23.480

07:23.481 --> 07:24.949

- Mm-hmm.

07:24.950 --> 07:27.418

07:27.419 --> 07:29.653
Agent Reynolds, the pleasure

07:29.654 --> 07:32.256
is ineffably mine.

07:42.200 --> 07:44.902
Sorry. I should've called
to give you a heads up.

07:44.903 --> 07:46.203
It happened so quickly,

07:46.204 --> 07:47.571
I literally just got off the plane.

07:47.572 --> 07:49.373
Give me an hour to swing by the office

07:49.374 --> 07:51.242
and get settled, and you
can fill me in on all this?

07:51.243 --> 07:52.643
Absolutely.

07:52.644 --> 07:54.578
Sir.

07:54.579 --> 07:57.047
(laughs) Life, right?

07:57.048 --> 07:58.549
Of all the gin joints,

07:58.550 --> 08:00.651
I get assigned to Abbie
Mills' old stomping grounds.

08:00.652 --> 08:02.186
After all the stories you told me,

08:02.187 --> 08:03.787
I almost feel like I've lived here before.

08:03.788 --> 08:05.629
Yeah, let's just hope
you don't want to leave

08:05.630 --> 08:06.523
as bad as I did.

08:06.524 --> 08:07.625
You made peace with that.

08:07.626 --> 08:08.959
Like anywhere,

08:08.960 --> 08:10.628
there's good, there's bad.

08:10.629 --> 08:12.897
But duty comes first.

08:12.898 --> 08:14.198
Right?

08:14.199 --> 08:16.200
True.

08:16.201 --> 08:17.534
True, and I'd better

08:17.535 --> 08:19.370
get busy with mine.

08:19.371 --> 08:20.638
Good to see you, Abs.

08:20.639 --> 08:22.306
Yep, you too, Danny.

08:40.191 --> 08:42.458
It's quite a facade, isn't it?

08:42.460 --> 08:43.861
Yes.

08:43.861 --> 08:45.529
Most impressive.

08:49.467 --> 08:51.235
Reynolds wants me

08:51.236 --> 08:52.603
to kick the tires on this one.

08:52.604 --> 08:54.605
Everett called the FBI
minutes before he died.

08:54.606 --> 08:56.640
We need to find out if he had a reason.

08:56.641 --> 08:59.610
I fear this man Everett's death

08:59.611 --> 09:02.813
may have been caused by
a supernatural entity.

09:02.814 --> 09:04.148
You saw something?

09:04.149 --> 09:05.382
Just a glimpse.

09:05.383 --> 09:09.353
There may be a new threat
hiding in the shadows.

09:09.354 --> 09:14.391
Or... is one, itself.

09:14.392 --> 09:17.895
I found references to creatures
of shadows and darkness...

09:17.896 --> 09:20.764
blights, wraiths, ghouls, oni,

09:20.765 --> 09:23.233
- bogeymen.
- I don't know what's worse:

09:23.234 --> 09:25.436
the supernatural back in full force

09:25.437 --> 09:27.972
or Daniel Reynolds as my boss.

09:27.973 --> 09:29.273
Your former classmate.

09:29.274 --> 09:30.607
Daniel's a climber.

09:30.608 --> 09:32.042
He's half the reason

09:32.043 --> 09:33.644
I got through the academy as fast as I did.

09:33.645 --> 09:35.612
We pushed each other.

09:35.613 --> 09:37.815
Competition can be a strong motivator.

09:39.617 --> 09:41.318
Lieutenant...

09:41.319 --> 09:42.653
I sensed something

09:42.654 --> 09:44.455
between the two of you that seemed...

09:44.456 --> 09:47.257
more than professional.

09:47.258 --> 09:49.226
Yeah?

09:52.297 --> 09:53.931
Mind your business.

09:55.500 --> 09:57.501
A good fences moment, perhaps?

09:57.502 --> 09:59.303
That's right, neighbor.

09:59.304 --> 10:01.138
Now what is all this?

10:01.139 --> 10:02.506
Ah.

10:02.507 --> 10:04.508
A plan to keep the
archive in our possession.

10:04.509 --> 10:06.176
I've applied to have it declared

10:06.177 --> 10:07.511
an historic landmark.

10:07.512 --> 10:09.279
Did you know there was a proposition

10:09.280 --> 10:11.348
to tear it down and erect an apothecary?

10:11.349 --> 10:13.050
An apothecary! Another one!

10:13.051 --> 10:16.553
Amidst the onslaught of
these faceless monstrosities,

10:16.554 --> 10:18.522
we must make a stand

10:18.523 --> 10:19.890
to preserve our history.

10:19.891 --> 10:21.191
Now, are we talking about

10:21.192 --> 10:23.093
this place or you?

10:23.094 --> 10:27.531
I shall find my place in this modern world,

10:27.532 --> 10:30.768
but never at the expense
of my colonial soul.

10:30.769 --> 10:32.536
I'm not going to argue.

10:32.537 --> 10:35.039
The archive is crucial
as a base of operations...

10:35.040 --> 10:36.840
now more than ever,

10:36.841 --> 10:40.110
if this new threat isn't an isolated event.

10:40.111 --> 10:43.614
Sadly, we have more questions
than answers at the moment.

10:43.615 --> 10:45.949
Especially if that thing
means what you think it does.

10:45.950 --> 10:48.786
And for all the good that we try to do,

10:48.787 --> 10:50.621
what if our destiny is to become

10:50.622 --> 10:52.656
agents of destruction?

10:52.657 --> 10:54.625
- (computer beeps)
- Crane,

10:54.626 --> 10:57.294
there's a message that Paul
Everett left for the FBI.

10:57.295 --> 10:59.496
I may be able to find a clue
as to what happened to him

10:59.497 --> 11:02.566
in the background noise of the phone call.

11:02.567 --> 11:03.767
My name is Paul Everett.

11:03.768 --> 11:05.736
Can I speak to an agent?

11:05.737 --> 11:07.771
I have important information.

11:07.772 --> 11:09.403
- MAN: Can you hold, please?
- Yeah, I'll hold.

11:09.404 --> 11:10.607
ABBIE: You see?

11:10.608 --> 11:12.743
It keeps recording for another 15 seconds.

11:12.744 --> 11:14.778
No sounds of attack,

11:14.779 --> 11:16.113
no sounds of distress from Everett.

11:16.114 --> 11:18.549
No, wait, there is something else.

11:18.550 --> 11:20.551
- (indistinct whispering)
- CRANE: Voices.

11:20.552 --> 11:22.152
Whispering.

11:23.688 --> 11:24.988
Other commuters?

11:24.989 --> 11:28.091
I can filter out some of the interference.

11:29.828 --> 11:31.462
WOMAN: Williams is right.

11:31.463 --> 11:33.297
EVERETT: We have to go public with this.

11:33.298 --> 11:35.265
We can't let him get away with it.

11:35.266 --> 11:36.600
So that's Everett talking.

11:36.601 --> 11:39.069
But who was he talking to?

11:39.070 --> 11:40.671
VOICE: Kill for secrets.

11:40.672 --> 11:41.905
ABBIE: There's another voice,

11:41.906 --> 11:44.241
but it's not on the same wavelength.

11:44.242 --> 11:46.176
I can scrub and boost it.

11:46.177 --> 11:48.679
VOICE: Secrets. Secrets.

11:48.680 --> 11:50.180
What is that?

11:50.181 --> 11:52.516
Kill for secrets.

11:52.517 --> 11:54.818
Secrets.

11:54.819 --> 11:57.421
I will kill.

12:24.745 --> 12:30.640

12:34.383 --> 12:36.618
A shadow that moves as if alive,

12:36.619 --> 12:38.620
in conjunction with whispering voices,

12:38.621 --> 12:40.522
jogged a memory...

12:40.523 --> 12:43.425
something I'd read in your
ancestor Grace Dixon's journal.

12:43.426 --> 12:45.193
Sometimes all it takes

12:45.194 --> 12:48.063
is to put pen to paper
to make a difference, hmm?

12:49.298 --> 12:50.932
CRANE: Here.

12:50.933 --> 12:54.636
25th of September, 1776.

12:54.637 --> 12:57.138
Ms. Dixon overheard a rumor

12:57.139 --> 12:58.573
that General Howe...

12:58.574 --> 13:00.709
who was the commanding British officer

13:00.710 --> 13:02.510
stationed in occupied New York City...

13:02.511 --> 13:04.913
had raised a whispering wraith

13:04.914 --> 13:07.382
in order to root out colonial spies.

13:09.218 --> 13:12.888
A dark ceremony, in which
a human host is bonded

13:12.889 --> 13:15.357
with demonic shadows.

13:15.358 --> 13:16.625
Here...

13:16.626 --> 13:18.526
these initials, M.C.

13:18.527 --> 13:20.929
The host in question
was an unfortunate wretch

13:20.930 --> 13:22.797
named Marcus Collins.

13:22.798 --> 13:24.866
- A friend of yours?
- Turncoat.

13:24.867 --> 13:27.369
A rank, base villain who reneged on his vow

13:27.370 --> 13:29.738
- to fight for liberty.
- Not a friend.

13:29.739 --> 13:31.373
It appears he was not only turned by Howe,

13:31.374 --> 13:32.974
but literally transformed,

13:32.975 --> 13:34.309
sent out to kill his fellows.

13:34.310 --> 13:35.810
Brave souls,

13:35.811 --> 13:38.013
with a secret worth dying for.

13:38.014 --> 13:39.948
General Howe's battle plans.

13:42.251 --> 13:45.987
Had these men lived to
deliver that information...

13:45.988 --> 13:50.091
thousands of lives would have been spared.

13:50.092 --> 13:54.829
Washington lost confidence
in Marcus Collins' loyalty...

13:54.830 --> 13:56.097
feared General Howe might learn

13:56.098 --> 13:57.632
the identities of the other agents.

13:57.633 --> 14:00.302
I was tasked with their extraction.

14:00.303 --> 14:01.770
I attended an event

14:01.771 --> 14:03.772
at the billeted quarters of General Howe,

14:03.773 --> 14:07.042
where I was to make
contact with the spymaster,

14:07.043 --> 14:09.678
none other than my constant
companion in adventure,

14:09.679 --> 14:12.847
Betsy Ross.

14:12.848 --> 14:14.749
♪

14:19.021 --> 14:21.189
Would the lady grant me the honor?

14:22.425 --> 14:25.026
The gentleman is too kind.

14:25.027 --> 14:26.661
The honor is all mine.

14:26.662 --> 14:28.930
What the hell are you doing, Crane?

14:28.931 --> 14:31.833
If anyone recognizes you,
you'll be shot as a deserter.

14:31.834 --> 14:33.034
I shan't be here long enough.

14:33.035 --> 14:35.003
And neither will you.

14:35.004 --> 14:36.604
Your cover's been blown.

14:36.605 --> 14:39.007
Marcus Collins is a turncoat.

14:39.008 --> 14:40.008
(gasps)

14:40.009 --> 14:42.016
We must warn the others.

14:42.289 --> 14:44.512
The secrets we share are
invaluable to the war effort.

14:44.513 --> 14:46.915
How many are embedded with you?

14:46.916 --> 14:48.883
Two men.

14:48.884 --> 14:50.885
One poses as Howe's valet,

14:50.886 --> 14:54.255
the other, that violin player.

14:56.092 --> 14:57.993
BETSY: Howe is looking this way.

14:57.994 --> 15:00.095
Does he know you, Crane?

15:00.096 --> 15:01.997
We met many years ago,

15:01.998 --> 15:04.466
when I first arrived on these shores.

15:04.467 --> 15:05.934
I'll handle him.

15:05.935 --> 15:07.669
And warn the others. Go.

15:07.670 --> 15:09.604
We'll meet at the stables in an hour.

15:14.610 --> 15:16.077
General...

15:16.078 --> 15:17.545
I haven't had the chance to thank you

15:17.546 --> 15:18.880
for this delightful party.

15:18.881 --> 15:21.082
In a moment.

15:21.083 --> 15:24.652
There is someone I must
have words with first.

15:24.653 --> 15:27.922
When a moment passes, it is gone forever.

15:27.923 --> 15:30.225
Or one can stop and take...

15:30.226 --> 15:32.861
full advantage of it.

15:40.936 --> 15:42.604
I was beginning to worry.

15:44.040 --> 15:45.940
Your clothing, Betsy...

15:45.941 --> 15:48.943
I told you I'd handle Howe.

15:48.944 --> 15:51.146
Not like that,

15:51.147 --> 15:52.213
my dear.

15:52.214 --> 15:54.482
Ready the horses

15:54.483 --> 15:56.918
while I look for the others.

16:02.425 --> 16:04.025
They're dead, Crane.

16:04.026 --> 16:06.461
Both of them.

16:14.937 --> 16:16.871
Is that you,

16:16.872 --> 16:18.706
you traitorous wretch?

16:18.707 --> 16:20.775
Come out of the shadows, Marcus Collins.

16:21.977 --> 16:24.212
Come out and face me!

16:24.213 --> 16:26.281
I'll have your head, Marcus Collins!

16:26.282 --> 16:27.982
MAN: This way!

16:30.920 --> 16:32.153
Fire on sight!

16:32.922 --> 16:34.422
Hyah! Yah!

16:35.724 --> 16:37.492
Betsy, come on!

16:46.068 --> 16:47.168
Are you all right?

16:47.169 --> 16:49.304
How could I not be?

16:49.305 --> 16:51.406
Hyah! Hyah!

16:53.142 --> 16:57.378
Crane... Crane.

16:57.379 --> 17:00.915
And now it seems the same dire
wraith who killed my fellows

17:00.916 --> 17:03.084
stalks the streets of Sleepy Hollow.

17:03.085 --> 17:05.954
So this creature was sent to root out spies

17:05.954 --> 17:07.755
who shared a secret then.

17:07.756 --> 17:10.058
He may have the same M.O.

17:10.059 --> 17:11.559
An excellent supposition, Lieutenant.

17:11.560 --> 17:13.962
The voices on Everett's call to the FBI.

17:13.963 --> 17:16.396
An unnamed woman and a man named Williams.

17:16.397 --> 17:17.663
And Everett worked as an accountant

17:17.664 --> 17:19.134
at the county comptroller's office.

17:19.135 --> 17:20.768
If they were coworkers,

17:20.769 --> 17:22.170
they may be the wraith's next victims.

17:22.171 --> 17:24.071
Here he is.

17:24.073 --> 17:26.174
Richard Williams.

17:38.988 --> 17:40.488
(phone rings)

17:40.489 --> 17:43.791
Hey, Joe.

17:43.792 --> 17:45.193
What?

17:45.194 --> 17:47.362
No, no, no. Don't call the police.

17:47.363 --> 17:48.763
I'll-I'll be right there.

17:51.567 --> 17:54.002
JOE: When I first got to your
place, I thought you had a wild party

17:54.003 --> 17:56.704
and I was like, "Why didn't she invite me?"

17:56.705 --> 17:58.139
And then I noticed the busted lock.

17:58.140 --> 17:59.440
What were you doing

17:59.441 --> 18:00.842
way out here in the first place?

18:00.843 --> 18:02.177
No, I was bringing over some stuff

18:02.178 --> 18:04.179
you left up in my dad's cabin.

18:04.180 --> 18:06.114
Just poked my head in, saw the mess.

18:12.988 --> 18:15.223
Thanks for this.

18:15.224 --> 18:17.058
Hey, he...

18:17.059 --> 18:19.861
he was as much a father
to you as he was to me.

18:19.862 --> 18:23.198
You know, whoever did this,
it doesn't look like a B and E.

18:23.199 --> 18:26.234
It's more like they were
searching for something?

18:26.235 --> 18:27.635
That's very astute, Encyclopedia Brown.

18:27.636 --> 18:29.204
Yeah, well,

18:29.205 --> 18:30.805
you and Abbie may have been his protégés,

18:30.806 --> 18:32.040
but I inherited some of my dad's

18:32.041 --> 18:35.143
- cop instincts.
- Hmm.

18:35.144 --> 18:37.111
Like, I can tell when you're holding back.

18:38.881 --> 18:40.615
Come on, what are you mixed up in?

18:40.616 --> 18:42.684
Nothing.

18:42.685 --> 18:44.852
Really. (chuckles)

18:44.853 --> 18:46.621
I've been keeping it super low-key lately.

18:46.622 --> 18:48.122
(sighs)

18:48.123 --> 18:50.425
What is it with you and your sister anyway?

18:50.426 --> 18:52.227
Look, you know, just 'cause my dad

18:52.228 --> 18:54.562
kept me on the outside of his investigation

18:54.563 --> 18:57.532
into the strange and stranger,
doesn't mean you have to.

18:57.533 --> 18:58.866
Corbin led Abbie and I down a path

18:58.867 --> 19:00.134
'cause we were already on it.

19:00.135 --> 19:01.369
- And not by choice.
- Okay, you know,

19:01.370 --> 19:03.137
you can slice it any way you want, Mills.

19:03.138 --> 19:04.572
Look, you knew a side of him

19:04.573 --> 19:06.074
that I never got to know.

19:06.075 --> 19:08.042
But I've been back in
town almost six months.

19:08.043 --> 19:09.877
I figured at some point,
you might let me in.

19:09.878 --> 19:11.246
It's not fun and games, Joe.

19:11.247 --> 19:12.447
People die.

19:12.448 --> 19:14.182
Yeah, and my father was one of them.

19:18.120 --> 19:20.355
Look, he wasn't just
stumbling around in the dark.

19:20.356 --> 19:22.190
He was on a mission.

19:22.191 --> 19:23.291
Sending you off all over the world

19:23.292 --> 19:24.959
to track things down for him.

19:24.960 --> 19:27.095
And before he had a
chance to tell me word one

19:27.096 --> 19:29.731
about why he did what he did, he was gone.

19:29.732 --> 19:31.966
Look...

19:31.967 --> 19:33.301
you and Abbie are the closest thing

19:33.302 --> 19:34.736
that I have left to family.

19:34.737 --> 19:36.237
I want you to look me in the eye,

19:36.238 --> 19:38.172
tell me you have no idea why this happened.

19:40.209 --> 19:42.977
I will call around, okay?

19:42.978 --> 19:44.345
See what I can find out.

19:44.346 --> 19:46.447
(sighs)

19:47.916 --> 19:50.518
The one thing I know about your dad?

19:50.519 --> 19:52.253
He didn't want you

19:52.254 --> 19:53.688
to follow in his footsteps.

19:53.689 --> 19:56.124
Just wanted you to find
something worth doing.

19:56.125 --> 19:57.492
The fact that you were able to parlay

19:57.493 --> 19:59.527
Marine medical training
into a job as an EMT?

19:59.528 --> 20:01.296
(chuckles)

20:01.297 --> 20:04.365
That would've made him so proud.

20:06.201 --> 20:07.835
Look, will you just promise you'll tell me

20:07.836 --> 20:09.704
if there is something going on?

20:09.705 --> 20:12.173
Absolutely.

20:12.174 --> 20:14.442
(laughs softly)

20:14.443 --> 20:16.244
All right, yeah.

20:16.245 --> 20:18.980
Later, Mills.

20:18.981 --> 20:20.415
Yeah, later.

20:25.988 --> 20:27.755
CRANE: Let's hope we find Mr. Williams

20:27.756 --> 20:29.357
before the whispering wraith

20:29.358 --> 20:31.059
catches scent of his secrets.

20:31.060 --> 20:33.361
(doorbell rings)

20:35.764 --> 20:37.832
Is anyone home?

20:37.833 --> 20:39.434
Mr. Williams?

20:39.435 --> 20:41.069
It's Agent Mills with the FBI.

20:41.070 --> 20:42.236
I have some questions

20:42.237 --> 20:43.671
regarding your association
with Paul Everett.

20:43.672 --> 20:45.373
(indistinct whispering)

20:45.374 --> 20:47.375
Mr. Williams?

20:47.376 --> 20:49.477
ABBIE: Is anyone home?

20:49.478 --> 20:51.646
Mr. Williams?

20:54.283 --> 20:55.416
Lieutenant?

20:56.819 --> 20:58.119
We have company.

20:58.120 --> 21:00.221
(indistinct whispering)

21:00.222 --> 21:02.423
Cease!

21:02.424 --> 21:03.958
No further.

21:11.667 --> 21:13.167
Secrets.

21:17.039 --> 21:18.773
Give us the names!

21:20.776 --> 21:22.443
Secrets.

21:22.444 --> 21:24.545
(indistinct whispering)

21:28.150 --> 21:29.450
(Abbie grunts)

21:29.451 --> 21:31.352
(tires screech)

21:32.755 --> 21:34.455
- The wraith's gone after Williams.
- Mm-hmm.

21:34.456 --> 21:36.290
(Abbie groans)

21:36.291 --> 21:37.325
Come on.

21:40.396 --> 21:42.397
(indistinct whispering)

21:42.398 --> 21:45.233
(Williams screaming)

21:48.904 --> 21:50.771
WRAITH: Secrets kill.

21:53.768 --> 21:55.809
Neither one of the victims had any priors.

21:55.810 --> 21:58.030
There's no reason why Williams
should have bolted like he did.

21:58.031 --> 21:59.987
I'm gonna head inside
and see what I can find.

21:59.988 --> 22:01.788
I'll return to the archives,

22:01.789 --> 22:04.891
see if I can discern a way to
combat this whispering wraith.

22:04.892 --> 22:07.060
(door opens, closes)

22:15.970 --> 22:18.037
(floorboard creaks)

22:30.384 --> 22:32.418
(clattering)

22:34.822 --> 22:36.222
Easy, slick.

22:36.223 --> 22:38.224
I'm a friendly.

22:38.225 --> 22:39.525
Sorry.

22:39.526 --> 22:41.527
I'm a little jumpy.

22:41.528 --> 22:43.229
The guy who lives here took off running

22:43.230 --> 22:45.198
when he got a visit from the FBI.

22:45.199 --> 22:46.332
So I don't know what to expect.

22:46.333 --> 22:48.201
But you have a theory.

22:48.202 --> 22:50.003
I know that look... you've caught a scent.

22:50.004 --> 22:51.070
Maybe.

22:51.071 --> 22:52.538
Don't know where it leads.

22:52.539 --> 22:54.040
Everett and Williams knew each other.

22:54.041 --> 22:56.009
Both worked at the comptroller's office.

22:56.010 --> 22:57.744
One had a heart attack,
the other drove into a tree.

22:57.745 --> 23:00.046
Not exactly a pattern, I know.

23:00.047 --> 23:01.347
Not yet, but there's something else,

23:01.348 --> 23:02.915
or you wouldn't be on it.

23:06.620 --> 23:10.390
Look, what we had, you
and I, at the academy...

23:10.391 --> 23:12.725
That was then.

23:12.726 --> 23:14.727
I just don't want it
to be weird between us.

23:14.728 --> 23:17.063
We work well together, always have.

23:17.064 --> 23:21.034
Even when our... "dynamic" changed.

23:21.035 --> 23:22.335
Points for the euphemism.

23:22.336 --> 23:25.338
I haven't heard that one before.

23:25.339 --> 23:27.340
We'll figure it out, Danny.

23:27.341 --> 23:29.475
We always did.

23:29.476 --> 23:32.545
Look, if you think there's
something to sniff out here,

23:32.546 --> 23:34.580
go for it.

23:34.581 --> 23:36.449
I trust your instincts.

23:37.918 --> 23:39.452
Thank you.

23:39.453 --> 23:40.820
Sir.

I just need you to take a ride with me.

24:18.625 --> 24:20.793

24:31.739 --> 24:34.540
Williams and Everett discovered
an embezzlement scheme

24:34.541 --> 24:36.309
planned by the Westchester
County comptroller,

24:36.310 --> 24:38.311
Arthur Weissman.

24:38.312 --> 24:42.582
Now, he is out to siphon
county employees' pension plans

24:42.583 --> 24:44.584
and steal millions.

24:44.585 --> 24:46.352
And they sought to stop him,

24:46.353 --> 24:48.488
to remove a blight on their community,

24:48.489 --> 24:51.991
just like the heroic spies who
sought to topple General Howe

24:51.992 --> 24:55.228
as he bled dry the city of New York.

24:55.229 --> 24:59.465
And now the very same traitorous
wretch who silenced my fellows

24:59.466 --> 25:02.602
seeks once again to remove a secret

25:02.603 --> 25:03.936
before it can be brought to light.

25:03.937 --> 25:06.005
Don't hold back.

25:08.942 --> 25:10.743
The truth is,

25:10.744 --> 25:12.745
the creature's shadows
brought forth a secret

25:12.746 --> 25:15.381
of which I have not spoken to another soul.

25:17.785 --> 25:20.586
I was captured,

25:20.587 --> 25:22.655
brought forth to General Howe.

25:22.656 --> 25:25.458
He offered me a full pardon

25:25.459 --> 25:29.462
if I give him a list of
names of Washington's spies.

25:29.463 --> 25:32.765
So I took quill in hand...

25:32.766 --> 25:35.868
and, uh...

25:35.869 --> 25:38.337
You didn't do it.

25:38.338 --> 25:40.873
No, I escaped, put the
whole thing behind me.

25:40.874 --> 25:44.477
But the thought had been
there, the intention.

25:44.478 --> 25:47.580
It was a moment of doubt
that has plagued me since.

25:47.581 --> 25:49.649
But in the end you did the right thing.

25:49.650 --> 25:51.651
And what about you?

25:51.652 --> 25:55.588
Did you feel... anything?

25:57.524 --> 26:00.326
There are more urgent secrets
that we need to deal with.

26:00.327 --> 26:04.497
A secretary named Susan James

26:04.498 --> 26:06.332
helped Williams and Everett

26:06.333 --> 26:08.000
get the information that they needed.

26:08.001 --> 26:10.002
She helped them build their case.

26:10.003 --> 26:12.338
We need to help her do the right thing.

26:12.339 --> 26:15.141
Is it possible this crooked
politician conjured the wraith

26:15.142 --> 26:16.776
to conceal his scheme?

26:16.777 --> 26:18.478
Right now, who did doesn't matter.

26:18.479 --> 26:20.513
If the wraith is targeting
anyone who knows this secret,

26:20.514 --> 26:21.914
she is next.

26:21.915 --> 26:24.584
Next but not last.

26:24.585 --> 26:26.752
You cracked the case, Lieutenant.

26:26.753 --> 26:29.822
And in doing so, you let
us in on their secret.

26:29.823 --> 26:33.359
The whispering wraith
may threaten Susan James,

26:33.360 --> 26:35.361
but now we know the secret.

26:35.362 --> 26:37.964
It will most certainly come for us.

26:48.905 --> 26:51.574
I have a little shadow.

26:51.575 --> 26:53.676
That goes in and out with me.

26:53.677 --> 26:58.280
And what can be the use of
him is more than I can see.

27:04.554 --> 27:06.388
(electrical buzzing)

27:09.893 --> 27:11.894
SUSAN: What is this place?

27:11.895 --> 27:14.397
You said we were going to a safe house.

27:14.398 --> 27:17.400
I said I was gonna take you somewhere safe.

27:17.401 --> 27:20.403
Your coworkers died because
of the secret that you shared.

27:20.404 --> 27:24.407
We're gonna make sure that
nothing happens to you.

27:24.408 --> 27:26.509
Miss James, welcome.

27:26.510 --> 27:28.944
My name is Ichabod Crane.

27:28.945 --> 27:32.048
Please stay within the light.

27:32.049 --> 27:34.950
Danger may lurk in the shadows.

27:38.422 --> 27:40.690
You know, whatever it is you want, man,

27:40.691 --> 27:43.592
she won't give it to you.

27:43.593 --> 27:47.396
You don't know Jenny Mills
like I know Jenny Mills.

27:47.397 --> 27:48.964
JENNY: Hey, Randall.

27:50.400 --> 27:52.601
Sit tight, okay?

27:52.602 --> 27:53.402
You know this creep?!

27:53.403 --> 27:56.472
Me and Mills go way back.

27:56.473 --> 27:58.174
Don't we?

27:58.175 --> 28:00.209
I heard you quit the game and gone soft.

28:00.210 --> 28:02.445
I didn't want to believe it.

28:02.446 --> 28:04.847
You were damn good.

28:04.848 --> 28:07.049
Well, I heard they locked
you up and threw away the key.

28:07.050 --> 28:08.617
RANDALL: Down in Louisiana.

28:08.618 --> 28:10.886
But some interested
parties pulled some strings,

28:10.887 --> 28:13.089
parties interested in what you've got...

28:13.090 --> 28:14.757
the Shard of Anubis.

28:14.758 --> 28:17.426
I've had it for years,
and no one gave a damn.

28:17.427 --> 28:18.861
What's so important about it?

28:18.862 --> 28:20.596
You'd know better than me.

28:20.597 --> 28:22.798
August Corbin sent you after it, right?

28:22.799 --> 28:25.034
And this here is his son.

28:25.035 --> 28:27.203
Isn't that a kicker?

28:27.204 --> 28:28.471
I'll tell you what.

28:28.472 --> 28:30.606
You hand over the shard,

28:30.607 --> 28:32.942
you two can walk.

28:32.943 --> 28:35.611
See, I can walk already.

28:35.612 --> 28:37.580
You're the one with the limp.

28:38.949 --> 28:41.550
(grunting)

28:46.623 --> 28:48.224
Hey, hold it.

28:51.528 --> 28:54.597
Did you mean what you
said, about the shard?

28:54.598 --> 28:56.799
Sure I did, before you
kicked me in the leg.

28:56.800 --> 28:58.801
Come on, man.

28:58.802 --> 29:00.569
You insulted me.

29:00.570 --> 29:03.472
You said I went soft.

29:03.473 --> 29:06.475
What do we got without our reputation?

29:09.246 --> 29:11.013
(chuckles)

29:11.014 --> 29:12.114
(laughs)

29:19.656 --> 29:23.025
Now, if this is a fake, I'm
gonna come back to visit.

29:29.299 --> 29:32.301
(car door opens, closes)

29:32.302 --> 29:34.403
(car engine starts)

29:39.910 --> 29:41.210
You all right?

29:41.211 --> 29:42.711
Yeah, I'm fine.

29:42.712 --> 29:44.013
He said he knew my dad?

29:44.014 --> 29:45.681
Yeah, they used to run in the same circle.

29:45.682 --> 29:47.716
- What was that thing you gave him?
- It doesn't matter.

29:47.717 --> 29:48.884
The hell it doesn't.

29:48.885 --> 29:50.319
The guy just kidnapped me for it.

29:50.320 --> 29:52.354
It doesn't matter, Joe.

29:52.355 --> 29:54.089
You could have been killed.

29:54.090 --> 29:56.592
Let me just get you out of here,

29:56.593 --> 29:58.327
and we can go back to our lives.

30:02.399 --> 30:05.100
Tell me you're close to finding
a way to stop this thing.

30:05.101 --> 30:09.371
There are many methods cited
to dispelling shadow beings,

30:09.372 --> 30:11.373
but unless you have an arrow blessed

30:11.374 --> 30:13.209
by one of the high priests of Angkor...

30:13.210 --> 30:15.644
Yeah, well, not on short notice.

30:15.645 --> 30:17.646
You certain that, as long
as these lights stay on,

30:17.647 --> 30:19.148
he can't get in?

30:19.149 --> 30:20.616
Theoretically, yes.

30:20.617 --> 30:22.618
These lights should keep him at bay.

30:22.619 --> 30:24.787
The wraith draws power from the shadows.

30:24.788 --> 30:27.389
Without them, he should
be at a disadvantage.

30:27.390 --> 30:29.391
Let's hope it buys us enough time

30:29.392 --> 30:31.393
to figure out how to get
rid of him permanently.

30:31.394 --> 30:32.628
How long am I supposed to stay here?

30:32.629 --> 30:33.662
When can I give my statement?

30:33.663 --> 30:35.798
Trust me when I tell you

30:35.799 --> 30:37.633
that this is all for your safety.

30:37.634 --> 30:39.969
I just want to be done with it, all of it.

30:39.970 --> 30:42.171
The weight of carrying a secret like this,

30:42.172 --> 30:43.606
it's debilitating.

30:43.607 --> 30:45.774
Believe me, I know.

30:45.775 --> 30:47.476
- (electrical buzzing)
- Whoa.

30:47.477 --> 30:48.577
What was that?

30:50.013 --> 30:52.014
Is that a short in the line?

30:52.015 --> 30:53.749
I shall go and see.

30:53.750 --> 30:55.050
Be careful.

30:55.051 --> 30:56.819
It wants us as much as it wants her.

31:09.035 --> 31:11.737
(electrical crackling)

31:28.787 --> 31:30.855
(gasps)

31:31.891 --> 31:33.592
Give us the names.

31:33.593 --> 31:36.027
The names, Crane.

31:36.028 --> 31:39.030
Damn you, foul creature.

31:39.031 --> 31:41.466
My secrets are my own.

31:48.140 --> 31:49.474
Go back.

31:49.475 --> 31:53.244
Back to whatever shadow you crawled from.

31:53.245 --> 31:54.979
(grunting)

32:00.686 --> 32:02.554
(gasping)

32:05.891 --> 32:06.991
ABBIE: Get off him!

32:08.694 --> 32:10.628
(booming)

32:12.064 --> 32:13.398
Crane.

32:13.399 --> 32:15.433
Stay with me, stay with me.

32:15.434 --> 32:18.403
WRAITH (whispering): Secrets kill.

32:18.404 --> 32:20.472
(loud boom)

32:22.608 --> 32:24.976
There's nowhere for us to run, Lieutenant.

32:24.977 --> 32:26.511
This creature will surely find us.

32:26.512 --> 32:28.313
We must find a way to defeat it.

32:28.314 --> 32:30.315
A weakness we can exploit

32:30.316 --> 32:31.583
so we can escape unscathed.

32:31.584 --> 32:33.351
That's it... it wants secrets.

32:33.352 --> 32:35.353
Yours, mine, Betsy Ross'.

32:35.354 --> 32:38.156
If Betsy knew the same secrets
as the spies that were killed,

32:38.157 --> 32:39.457
why was she spared?

32:39.458 --> 32:42.327
I did not see the creature that day.

32:42.328 --> 32:44.162
I had no idea it was responsible.

32:44.163 --> 32:46.498
Look away.

32:46.499 --> 32:48.266
(loud boom)

32:49.802 --> 32:52.036
The answer is in your memory of that day.

32:52.037 --> 32:53.605
Something Betsy did got it off her scent

32:53.606 --> 32:55.273
and can get it off of ours.

32:55.274 --> 32:56.741
Right, uh...

32:56.742 --> 32:57.909
Betsy was angry.

32:57.910 --> 32:59.277
I-I heard her shout.

32:59.278 --> 33:00.345
I'll have your head,

33:00.346 --> 33:02.480
Marcus Collins!

33:02.481 --> 33:04.849
Come out and face me!

33:04.850 --> 33:07.085
CRANE: Remembering it now,

33:07.086 --> 33:09.487
the shadows retreated

33:09.488 --> 33:11.489
when she said...

33:11.490 --> 33:13.491
his name.

33:13.492 --> 33:14.859
Of course.

33:14.860 --> 33:17.295
Many demonic entities share one weakness...

33:17.296 --> 33:19.330
if you know their true name,

33:19.331 --> 33:22.867
their power cannot harm you.

33:22.868 --> 33:24.369
Crane?!

33:25.771 --> 33:27.205
Come down.

33:27.206 --> 33:29.607
Come on, come out of the shadows,

33:29.608 --> 33:31.543
Marcus Collins.

33:33.479 --> 33:36.214
Oh.

33:36.215 --> 33:38.817
I called your name.

33:38.818 --> 33:40.585
Marcus Collins,

33:40.586 --> 33:44.556
the traitorous wretch
who betrays his fellows.

33:44.557 --> 33:46.858
Marcus Collins.

33:48.594 --> 33:51.863
No longer can you skulk in
the shadows, Marcus Collins.

33:51.864 --> 33:53.431
Come and face me!

33:53.432 --> 33:54.566
Come on!

33:57.970 --> 33:59.971
You willingly made a pact with evil.

33:59.972 --> 34:02.173
I had the same choice.

34:02.174 --> 34:04.709
Give us the names!

34:11.417 --> 34:15.485
I will never recant my
decision to be an American.

34:16.554 --> 34:18.755
I will never, never

34:18.757 --> 34:20.425
go back on my oath to fight for freedom

34:20.426 --> 34:22.594
against tyranny!

34:22.594 --> 34:24.161
I was offered clemency by the enemy,

34:24.163 --> 34:25.563
but I did not accept it,

34:25.563 --> 34:29.167
because I hold firm and you do not!

34:29.168 --> 34:31.268
- (growls)
- (Crane grunting)

34:40.079 --> 34:41.411
(roaring)

34:53.225 --> 34:55.426
Thank you, Lieutenant.

34:55.427 --> 34:58.396
It appears the threat has passed.

34:58.397 --> 35:01.866
All that's left is to bring
one more secret into the light.

35:13.141 --> 35:15.175
(door opens)

35:21.549 --> 35:25.152
This whole Marcus Collins
thing is still bothering you?

35:25.153 --> 35:27.821
Well...

35:28.149 --> 35:30.150
Yes, I defied General Howe.

35:30.151 --> 35:32.453
Yes,

35:32.454 --> 35:35.622
I refused to bewray my fellow spies.

35:35.623 --> 35:38.158
But I did consider the option.

35:38.159 --> 35:40.828
Now, what does that say about me?

35:40.829 --> 35:42.863
That you are a human being,

35:42.864 --> 35:45.632
like the rest of us.

35:45.633 --> 35:47.868
And when the chips came down,

35:47.869 --> 35:49.803
you did the right thing.

35:49.804 --> 35:51.004
Hmm.

35:51.005 --> 35:54.007
To which we always strive.

35:54.008 --> 35:56.176
Nevertheless,

35:56.177 --> 36:00.080
the shame of that moment stuck

36:00.081 --> 36:02.082
- for centuries.
- Hmm.

36:02.083 --> 36:03.851
It's all the more reason

36:03.852 --> 36:06.453
why settling in this time is so important.

36:06.454 --> 36:08.922
And of course, having you by my side

36:08.923 --> 36:10.924
is the greatest boon.

36:18.533 --> 36:20.901
Mmm.

36:26.407 --> 36:29.943
The weight of a secret lifted.

36:33.515 --> 36:36.884
It's very freeing.

36:36.885 --> 36:39.453
Okay.

36:42.924 --> 36:44.558
This is something I haven't been able

36:44.559 --> 36:47.327
to talk about with anyone.

36:47.328 --> 36:49.062
In the months that you were gone,

36:49.063 --> 36:50.864
without anything supernatural

36:50.865 --> 36:53.066
crawling out of the woodwork,

36:53.067 --> 36:56.003
a lot of personal stuff came up.

36:56.004 --> 36:59.406
And after learning
everything about my mother,

36:59.407 --> 37:02.876
I searched the FBI database...

37:02.877 --> 37:06.847
and I found my father.

37:09.217 --> 37:11.885
He's alive.

37:11.886 --> 37:14.655
He lives up in Saratoga.

37:14.656 --> 37:18.025
Now, you've not seen him since...?

37:18.026 --> 37:20.060
Not since I was six.

37:20.061 --> 37:21.028
Oh.

37:21.029 --> 37:23.096
So, it got me wondering

37:23.097 --> 37:25.299
what was his life like?

37:25.300 --> 37:26.934
Why did he leave?

37:26.935 --> 37:29.102
Why he never came back?

37:29.103 --> 37:30.771
I've been watching him.

37:30.772 --> 37:32.973
I take pictures.

37:32.974 --> 37:34.541
I don't know why. (laughs)

37:34.542 --> 37:36.276
Uh...

37:36.277 --> 37:37.477
Maybe it's control.

37:37.478 --> 37:39.146
Maybe it's... to try to have

37:39.147 --> 37:42.115
some kind of connection from afar.

37:42.116 --> 37:44.217
Every time I tell myself,

37:44.218 --> 37:46.053
today I'm gonna get out of the car,

37:46.054 --> 37:47.287
I'm gonna walk over,

37:47.288 --> 37:49.823
I'm gonna say something.

37:51.726 --> 37:54.027
I haven't.

37:54.028 --> 37:57.030
I don't know if I can.

37:57.031 --> 37:58.365
And I haven't told Jenny,

37:58.366 --> 38:00.934
because she'd want to do something now.

38:00.935 --> 38:03.036
(both chuckle)

38:04.739 --> 38:06.740
But I'm not sure I'm ready yet.

38:06.741 --> 38:09.142
You've made the first step.

38:09.143 --> 38:10.911
Just sharing with me.

38:10.912 --> 38:13.547
No, Lieutenant,

38:13.548 --> 38:14.981
take that victory.

38:16.951 --> 38:18.652
It is hard won.

38:28.596 --> 38:31.765
ABBIE: Susan James' secret is out,

38:31.766 --> 38:33.200
Weissman is behind bars,

38:33.201 --> 38:35.168
and the pension plan is safe.

38:35.169 --> 38:38.171
Talk about a solid first
couple of days on the new job.

38:38.172 --> 38:40.173
You spun gold out of straw on this one.

38:40.174 --> 38:42.175
You gave me the room to do what I do,

38:42.176 --> 38:43.677
and I appreciate that.

38:43.678 --> 38:45.646
I am a little surprised

38:45.647 --> 38:47.681
you took this job in the first place.

38:47.682 --> 38:49.816
Regional chief at a small,
resident agency like this?

38:49.817 --> 38:52.953
Build my résumé, polish the skill set.

38:52.954 --> 38:54.154
Then go large.

38:54.155 --> 38:56.156
That's the Daniel Reynolds I know.

38:56.157 --> 38:57.924
Like you don't have an exit strategy.

38:57.925 --> 38:59.993
I remember a lot of "big fish
growing out of their pond"

38:59.994 --> 39:02.029
talk back at the academy.

39:02.030 --> 39:04.998
Or was that just something to
fill the pauses over breakfast?

39:04.999 --> 39:06.366
I know what I said.

39:06.367 --> 39:08.135
But...

39:08.136 --> 39:10.003
I have responsibilities.

39:10.004 --> 39:11.004
To who... your sister?

39:11.005 --> 39:12.606
Your roommate?

39:12.607 --> 39:14.975
And-and-and what is it

39:14.976 --> 39:16.209
about guys with accents?

39:16.210 --> 39:18.278
Don't push it, Reynolds.

39:18.279 --> 39:20.280
Hey, I know you don't
see yourself here forever.

39:20.281 --> 39:22.883
And if we play our cards right,

39:22.884 --> 39:25.218
we can help each other
get what we both want.

39:25.219 --> 39:28.188
You sure I still want it?

39:28.189 --> 39:31.224
After what you showed me today,

39:31.225 --> 39:33.460
try and convince me otherwise.

39:35.730 --> 39:37.030
Like you said,

39:37.031 --> 39:38.498
solid first few days on the job.

39:38.499 --> 39:40.700
See where it takes us.

39:46.441 --> 39:47.941
You know, I think

39:47.942 --> 39:50.277
after being handcuffed to a tree, I, uh,

39:50.278 --> 39:53.513
I deserve some kind of an explanation.

39:55.183 --> 39:56.516
(quiet laugh)

39:56.517 --> 39:58.885
Once you open the door, Joe,

39:58.886 --> 40:01.722
this whole world that
Abbie and I are a part of,

40:01.723 --> 40:05.692
you can't close it so easily.

40:05.693 --> 40:09.129
You know, whatever my father was after,

40:09.130 --> 40:10.764
he wasn't afraid to find it.

40:13.501 --> 40:16.670
It was his life's work, Jenny,
and he never got to finish it.

40:16.671 --> 40:19.773
Never found what he was looking for.

40:19.774 --> 40:21.274
What kind of a son am I
if I don't at least try

40:21.275 --> 40:23.310
to pick up where he left off?

40:23.311 --> 40:26.012
So, if the shard meant something to him,

40:26.013 --> 40:28.148
it should mean something to us.

40:28.149 --> 40:31.151
Wait, you want to go after it?

40:31.152 --> 40:33.019
Like, together?

40:33.020 --> 40:34.488
Damn straight.

40:34.489 --> 40:36.523
I want you to show me

40:36.524 --> 40:38.825
what that side of his life was all about.

40:38.826 --> 40:40.994
Like it or not,

40:40.995 --> 40:42.829
it's the only legacy he left me.

40:42.830 --> 40:44.397
It's just a part of my life

40:44.398 --> 40:46.733
I've never shared with anyone before.

40:46.734 --> 40:49.469
I know.

40:49.470 --> 40:51.872
I'm saying I think it's time you did.

40:53.107 --> 40:54.941
CRANE: Ms. Corinth,

40:54.942 --> 40:56.510
thank you once again

40:56.511 --> 40:58.512
for your reconnoiter of the property.

40:58.513 --> 41:00.413
Your archive is an amazing building,

41:00.414 --> 41:03.183
totally deserving of historic status.

41:03.184 --> 41:05.619
There is only one stumbling block.

41:05.620 --> 41:07.621
You're a British citizen.

41:07.622 --> 41:11.424
Uh... I consider myself an American.

41:11.425 --> 41:14.261
Sure, but the State won't release funds

41:14.262 --> 41:16.296
unless you're an American citizen

41:16.297 --> 41:18.832
or have landed immigrant status.

41:18.833 --> 41:21.201
You can try and take it
up with the permit office.

41:21.202 --> 41:24.070
Mr. Crane?

41:24.071 --> 41:26.406
Oh, uh, yes.

41:26.407 --> 41:28.875
Thank you. That's very generous of you.

41:28.876 --> 41:30.977
You shall hear from me soon.

41:45.393 --> 41:47.093
ABBIE: The coffee shop.

41:47.094 --> 41:48.695
I don't understand. It's right there.

41:48.696 --> 41:49.996
No longer.

41:49.997 --> 41:51.464
And it apparently never was.

41:51.465 --> 41:53.466
But I spoke to a woman that day...

41:53.467 --> 41:55.202
the coffee shop hostess.

41:55.203 --> 41:56.236
This woman?

41:56.237 --> 41:58.238
That is her.

41:58.239 --> 42:00.040
There's Paul Everett.

42:00.041 --> 42:02.042
She's talking to him.

42:02.043 --> 42:03.343
Could she be connected to the arrival

42:03.344 --> 42:04.744
of the whispering wraith?

42:07.415 --> 42:09.549
I met that woman.

42:09.550 --> 42:11.051
At Mabie's last week.

42:11.052 --> 42:12.419
She told me her name.

42:12.420 --> 42:13.753
You from out of town?

42:13.754 --> 42:15.388
Yes, I just arrived.

42:15.389 --> 42:17.190
Pandora.

42:17.191 --> 42:18.425
Pandora!

42:18.426 --> 42:20.227
Pandor...

42:20.228 --> 42:22.929
As in the mythical woman with the box?

42:22.930 --> 42:25.298
ABBIE: This isn't a myth.

42:25.299 --> 42:27.467
Whoever... whatever she is,

42:27.468 --> 42:29.936
she's here now in Sleepy Hollow

42:29.937 --> 42:32.305
throwing monsters at us.

42:46.888 --> 42:48.121
Pandora's box was said to contain

42:48.122 --> 42:49.689
all the evils in the world,

42:49.690 --> 42:51.658
which begs the question...

42:51.659 --> 42:54.260
which one does she have
in store for us next?
