13:58.170 --> 14:01.120
Even if we do
"blow him out of the sky,"

14:01.920 --> 14:04.710
we don't want him
to crash down onto the city.

14:04.710 --> 14:07.540
The only answer is to find
a way to get the shield up.

14:07.540 --> 14:08.710
One last time.

14:17.120 --> 14:18.120
Hera...

14:22.670 --> 14:23.710
Over here.

14:24.250 --> 14:26.040
We should use
the primary schematic

14:26.040 --> 14:27.790
if we're going to find a way
to raise the shield.

14:28.420 --> 14:31.080
We need to get down here
and take control
of the power terminals.

14:32.670 --> 14:36.000
How do we get past
all the Imperials
we've locked in here with us?

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
We can bypass
the upper barracks levels

14:38.000 --> 14:39.830
using
the executive turbo lifts.

14:45.790 --> 14:47.710
So, we got a plan
to get the shield up.

14:47.710 --> 14:50.620
The trick is to pull it off
before Thrawn loses patience.

14:51.670 --> 14:52.750
We need
to stall him somehow.

14:53.750 --> 14:54.750
Ezra?

14:57.790 --> 14:59.210
We have
to stop him.

15:00.830 --> 15:02.170
Ezra, don't do this!

15:02.170 --> 15:04.460
Hera,
we have to trust him.

15:05.040 --> 15:07.750
The best way we can help
is to get that shield up,

15:07.750 --> 15:10.250
so when Ezra makes his move,
we're ready.

15:10.620 --> 15:13.170
We have to assume
the generator room
will be well-guarded,

15:13.380 --> 15:16.080
so we'll need two teams
to hit it from different sides

15:16.080 --> 15:17.790
if we're gonna capture
both power terminals.

15:18.790 --> 15:20.540
That is,
if you agree, Hera.

15:21.960 --> 15:23.170
It's a good plan.

15:23.960 --> 15:25.290
The best chance we've got.

15:27.750 --> 15:28.920
(BEEPING)

15:29.830 --> 15:30.830
Stormtroopers.

15:40.830 --> 15:43.540
It appears my troops
have decided

15:43.540 --> 15:44.880
your drill is over.

15:57.540 --> 15:59.500
(ENGINE WHIRRING)

16:13.330 --> 16:15.750
It was a wise decision
for you to surrender.

16:16.420 --> 16:17.580
I didn't have
much choice.

16:20.880 --> 16:21.750
Oh, nonsense.

16:22.420 --> 16:24.420
You could have chosen
to let your people die.

16:25.710 --> 16:28.420
However,
you chose to be a Jedi.

16:30.040 --> 16:31.080
Predictable.

16:31.830 --> 16:34.710
You follow a long history
written by the Jedi,

16:34.710 --> 16:37.790
where they choose
what they believe
to be morally correct,

16:38.210 --> 16:41.170
instead of what is
strategically sound.

16:42.580 --> 16:44.170
And yet,
the Jedi have survived.

16:45.040 --> 16:48.040
Hmm, the Jedi once numbered
in the thousands.

16:48.670 --> 16:51.920
What's left are a scattered,
frightened lot,

16:52.250 --> 16:55.580
mostly beaten and in hiding,
or poorly trained children,

16:55.580 --> 16:57.460
like yourself.

17:00.250 --> 17:01.380
I must admit,

17:01.830 --> 17:04.670
the mysteries of the Force
are an enigma to me.

17:05.420 --> 17:07.710
But for all
those abilities,

17:08.000 --> 17:10.790
all the power,
the Jedi lacked

17:10.790 --> 17:13.250
the vision
for how to wield it.

17:13.830 --> 17:15.540
The Force
isn't a weapon,

17:16.120 --> 17:17.670
but you'll never
understand that.

17:18.830 --> 17:20.000
Oh, I don't have to.

17:21.790 --> 17:24.750
It was not my intention
to utterly destroy Lothal,

17:24.750 --> 17:26.620
but that is inevitable now.

17:29.620 --> 17:32.290
These are a few
of the artifacts
I've gathered

17:32.620 --> 17:33.830
from your home world.

17:34.620 --> 17:35.790
I saved
what I could.

17:36.210 --> 17:39.170
I have even taken
some of Sabine Wren's work.

17:39.170 --> 17:40.790
She's quite talented.

17:42.620 --> 17:44.460
Or was quite talented.

17:45.540 --> 17:47.670
You think you can take
whatever you want,

17:48.420 --> 17:50.830
things you didn't make,
didn't earn,

17:51.330 --> 17:53.290
things you
don't even understand!

17:55.170 --> 17:58.380
You don't deserve
to have this art or Lothal.

17:58.790 --> 18:00.710
Who deserves what
is irrelevant.

18:01.290 --> 18:05.710
What matters is
who has power.

18:07.460 --> 18:08.580
But that is

18:09.170 --> 18:11.000
something the Jedi
won't teach you,

18:11.000 --> 18:13.040
so I'll take you
to someone who will.

18:25.170 --> 18:26.420
My Emperor.

18:27.040 --> 18:29.750
I have brought you
Ezra Bridger.

18:35.750 --> 18:37.080
My dear boy,

18:37.080 --> 18:38.830
I've so wanted to meet you,

18:39.670 --> 18:42.790
and here you are at last.

18:54.330 --> 18:55.790
(WOLF PANTING)

18:57.210 --> 18:58.250
(GROANS)

18:59.710 --> 19:00.710
(STAMMERS) Wolf?

19:01.620 --> 19:02.750
(GROANS) What?

19:02.750 --> 19:04.830
No, I mean...
Not you.

19:05.330 --> 19:06.380
Look!

19:07.380 --> 19:09.830
Hey. Vizago, get up!

19:10.330 --> 19:11.830
(GROANS)

19:12.460 --> 19:13.790
What's happened now?

19:14.580 --> 19:17.000
We were ambushed
by that creature.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.580
(SIGHS) Thrawn's pet.

19:18.580 --> 19:20.960
Without the help
of our friends here,

19:20.960 --> 19:22.000
we'd have
been goners.

19:22.500 --> 19:25.250
Speaking of gone,
the last gunship is missing!

19:25.790 --> 19:27.880
That thing
is gonna warn Thrawn
about our attack!

19:28.580 --> 19:29.790
It's just like Ezra said.

19:30.460 --> 19:31.540
Come on!

19:35.290 --> 19:37.790
Wait, what does that mean?
What do you mean,
"it's just like Ezra said"?

19:37.790 --> 19:39.620
Ezra told me
that there was a chance

19:39.620 --> 19:41.250
Thrawn would get back
to the Capital

19:41.250 --> 19:42.540
before they finished
their plan,

19:42.830 --> 19:44.040
and if it looked like
that was the case,

19:44.750 --> 19:45.880
he gave us
a special mission.

20:07.420 --> 20:09.620
Ezra wanted us to go
into high orbit around Lothal

20:09.620 --> 20:11.830
and send out a signal beacon
on Frequency Zero.

20:12.210 --> 20:13.580
Frequency Zero?

20:13.830 --> 20:15.420
Nobody uses
that anymore.

20:15.710 --> 20:19.620
Who are we supposed to be?
Who are we supposed
to be contacting?

20:20.080 --> 20:22.250
Not sure it's a who,
more like a what,

20:22.830 --> 20:24.670
and if I told you what,

20:24.670 --> 20:27.620
well, that's the part
you might not believe.

20:31.170 --> 20:32.790
(ENGINE WHOOSHES)

20:38.750 --> 20:39.960
(VENT COVER CLANGS)

20:42.790 --> 20:44.000
(GRUNTS AND SQUEAKS)

20:46.120 --> 20:47.120
Blast him!

20:51.380 --> 20:53.580
Ha-ha.
Works every time.

20:53.960 --> 20:56.290
Of course it worked,
my friends.

20:56.830 --> 20:58.210
Just look at Melch.

20:58.460 --> 21:00.750
He's positively
magnetic!

21:01.210 --> 21:03.830
I'm sure you've got
a special relationship, Hondo,

21:03.830 --> 21:05.250
but we're kind of
on a mission here.

21:05.830 --> 21:07.500
We've gotta get that shield up
over the city.

21:08.620 --> 21:11.000
Rex, Hondo, and Ketsu,
you take the north tower.

21:11.380 --> 21:13.750
Zeb, Kallus, Gregor,
you take the south.

21:13.750 --> 21:15.170
I'll talk you through it
from here.

21:15.960 --> 21:17.000
Let's go, Rebels.

21:23.670 --> 21:24.670
What is it?

21:25.210 --> 21:26.620
I just hope Ezra...

21:27.500 --> 21:28.790
He knows
what he's doing.

21:33.380 --> 21:35.710
That will be all,
Grand Admiral.

21:39.040 --> 21:41.920
I apologize for not
being there in person,

21:41.920 --> 21:46.000
but governing the galaxy
takes up much of my time.

21:46.830 --> 21:47.710
I know who you are,

21:48.540 --> 21:49.880
and what you are.

21:49.880 --> 21:51.290
You misjudge me.

21:51.960 --> 21:54.290
Can you not see
the opportunity

21:54.290 --> 21:55.830
that stands here
before you?

21:56.790 --> 21:58.620
I see a part
of the Jedi Temple,

21:58.620 --> 22:00.120
which you stole
from Lothal.

22:00.580 --> 22:03.670
I had this portion
of the Temple moved here

22:03.670 --> 22:05.710
stone by stone for you.

22:06.420 --> 22:08.120
Forgive me,
but I would have thought

22:08.120 --> 22:10.460
you would thank me
for this effort.

22:10.460 --> 22:11.710
Thank you?

22:12.500 --> 22:14.080
Thank you
for destroying the Temple?

22:14.920 --> 22:16.540
For imprisoning
my people?

22:16.540 --> 22:17.790
For killing my parents?

22:18.420 --> 22:21.790
My dear boy,
it's you who chose
to destroy the Temple.

22:22.380 --> 22:25.210
The actions
of your Rebel friends

22:25.210 --> 22:26.960
require a firm hand

22:26.960 --> 22:30.460
to ensure
that there is order on Lothal.

22:30.750 --> 22:32.000
As for your parents,

22:32.290 --> 22:35.920
allow me to offer
what might have been,

22:36.420 --> 22:39.710
and what yet may be.

Ezra.

23:02.670 --> 23:04.000
They are waiting
for you.

23:04.790 --> 23:05.620
(SOFTLY) Go to them.

23:05.920 --> 23:07.170
Open the door.

23:07.750 --> 23:09.920
This is what you want,
isn't it?

23:11.920 --> 23:13.830
The life you deserved.

23:16.670 --> 23:17.710
But it can't be.

23:18.750 --> 23:19.830
Yes, it can,

23:20.120 --> 23:23.580
but you must choose
to make it so.

23:43.960 --> 23:45.000

down there?

23:45.920 --> 23:48.500
Oh... It's just great.

23:49.120 --> 23:50.420
Really wish
you were here.

23:54.710 --> 23:56.040
Our problems
are multiplying.

23:56.330 --> 23:57.620
We could use
some help down here.

23:58.250 --> 23:59.460
Team B,
where are you?

24:00.040 --> 24:01.880
We're heading towards
Sector GL-44,

24:02.290 --> 24:03.460
but you know
that plan we had

24:03.460 --> 24:05.670
to trap all these
stormtroopers in the dome?

24:05.960 --> 24:06.960
It just occurred to me,

24:07.330 --> 24:10.830
we're trapped with all these
stormtroopers in this dome!

24:14.420 --> 24:17.210
We got it.
Ryder, close
blast door 58-58.

24:24.290 --> 24:26.500
You should have a clear path
to the shield generator now.

24:35.580 --> 24:37.790
Rex, we need those towers
back online now!

24:44.210 --> 24:45.960
I can't get to
the control panel.

24:45.960 --> 24:47.460

to extend

24:58.830 --> 25:01.880
Find an override panel.
You should be able to do it
manually from there.

25:04.420 --> 25:05.420
Any ideas?

25:06.120 --> 25:08.040
Yeah, but I'm
gonna stay anyway.

your favorite!

25:19.750 --> 25:21.880

be open forever.

25:23.210 --> 25:24.210
Go now,

25:25.120 --> 25:26.670

No. This is a lie.
