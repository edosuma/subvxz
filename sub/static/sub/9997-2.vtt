<i>******</i>

00:03.990 --> 00:07.480
****

00:07.490 --> 00:11.150
The day his parents brought Frisky
home, Jeff couldn't conceal his joy.

00:12.110 --> 00:14.910
Jeff never lost his love for animals.

00:15.210 --> 00:19.620
It's hard to know exactly when his
toothy grin gave way to darker thoughts,

00:19.630 --> 00:23.610
but in 1991, the police were responding
to a complaint at Jeff's apartment

00:23.620 --> 00:26.170
when one of them
noticed an unusual smell.

00:26.550 --> 00:29.610
They found a severed
head in his refrigerator.

00:30.090 --> 00:35.140
There was another one in the freezer, as
well as three more skulls in a filing cabinet,

00:35.160 --> 00:38.050
and four others spread throughout
the Milwaukee apartment.

00:38.920 --> 00:42.850
For most of us, that was the first
time we ever heard about Jeffrey Dahmer.

00:42.860 --> 00:44.760
He was 31 years old.

00:44.770 --> 00:47.330
He'd been killing
people since he was 18.

00:47.710 --> 00:51.650
He was somebody's son,
somebody's brother.

00:52.060 --> 00:55.730
Leslie was the prettiest
girl in Altadena,California.

00:56.050 --> 00:59.310
In fact,she was elected
homecoming princess twice.

00:59.320 --> 01:03.340
After she graduated from high school,
she met her first serious boyfriend.

01:03.350 --> 01:05.510
His name was Charlie.

01:05.790 --> 01:07.780
Leslie Van Houten
joined the Manson family

01:07.790 --> 01:11.590
and was later charged with the
murder of Rosemary and Leno LaBianca.

01:12.030 --> 01:15.060
After stabbing Rosemary 16 times,

01:15.070 --> 01:20.610
Leslie changed into clothes from the
LaBiancas' closet and raided their refrigerator.

01:21.380 --> 01:25.370
And when Leslie walked into court
every morning with a smile on her face,

01:25.590 --> 01:31.190
the whole world wondered: how
could someone who looked so sweet,

01:31.500 --> 01:36.340
who looked like she could be any
one of our daughters, go so wrong?

01:37.080 --> 01:41.240
We want to believe that every child is
born into this world a blank vessel...

01:42.480 --> 01:46.860
{\a6}<i>'BTK***'******</i>

01:42.350 --> 01:45.810
waiting to be filled with
only the best parts of us.

01:50.690 --> 01:54.390
{\a6}<i>Aileen******</i>

01:48.050 --> 01:52.710
And yet,no matter how hard we try,

01:53.360 --> 01:58.250
invariably the day comes when our child
does something that surprises us...

01:58.260 --> 02:02.440
{\a6}<i>Ted******</i>

01:59.910 --> 02:03.400
becomes someone we
don't quite recognize.

02:06.780 --> 02:09.289
- I'm home.
- I'm in the kitchen,Dad.

02:09.300 --> 02:12.700
And we find ourselves
thinking, who is that person?

02:12.710 --> 02:16.370
Okay. Where's your mom and your sisters?

03:09.170 --> 03:11.720
Thanks.

03:13.270 --> 03:15.660
Okay.

03:16.820 --> 03:19.220
Thank you,Mommy.

03:19.630 --> 03:22.120
Someone looks tired.

03:22.440 --> 03:25.320
- I didn't sleep good.
- Well,why is that?

03:26.500 --> 03:29.190
- Why you looking at me?
- You snore.

03:29.200 --> 03:32.250
That's a lie! I've never
once heard me snoring!

03:32.260 --> 03:36.490
You know you snore. We
all know that you snore.

03:36.500 --> 03:39.310
Yeah,well, fine,kick
me out of the house.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.720
Kick me out of the family.

03:40.750 --> 03:43.030
Nobody's kicking you out of anywhere.

03:43.040 --> 03:45.450
I think I need my own room.

03:45.460 --> 03:48.570
Well,I'm sorry,honey. I don't
have another room to give you.

03:48.580 --> 03:50.880
But Ariel has her own room.

03:50.920 --> 03:53.290
Everybody has their own room.

03:53.300 --> 03:54.600
I don't have my own room.

03:54.610 --> 03:55.780
Hey,here's an idea.

03:55.800 --> 03:59.120
Since Ariel doesn't snore
and Marie doesn't snore,

03:59.140 --> 04:02.760
how about they share the bunk
bed and I'll get Ariel's room?

04:02.780 --> 04:04.360
Hey,here's an idea.

04:04.390 --> 04:08.100
How about we go back to that part where
you were talking about leaving the family?

04:09.180 --> 04:13.340
Okay,enough! Everybody,calm
down. Be patient.

04:13.580 --> 04:18.390
Your sister here is gonna go to college
soon and everyone will have their own room.

04:18.399 --> 04:20.950
- Me too?
- Don't push your luck.

04:23.860 --> 04:26.710
Hey,guys,we're leaving in
ten minutes. Did you hear me?

04:26.720 --> 04:28.570
Mm-hmm,yep.

04:31.160 --> 04:33.900
Hey,so,can I,uh,talk to
you guys about something?

04:33.910 --> 04:36.160
All depends. What's the something?

04:36.170 --> 04:39.330
Well,there's this,uh,
thing tomorrow night.

04:39.340 --> 04:42.980
And I know that it's a school night,
but I would,uh, really like to go.

04:42.990 --> 04:44.850
Well,can we know what this thing is?

04:44.870 --> 04:48.830
It's a scavenger hunt. A really cool
scavenger hunt. They do it every year.

04:48.840 --> 04:53.370
It's,uh,for the seniors and the boy who's
putting it together asked Ashley and I if,uh,

04:53.380 --> 04:56.060
we wanted to come, even
though we're not seniors.

04:56.070 --> 05:00.970
Honey,uh,when you find these things, how
does it work? Do you go in cars? Do you drive?

05:00.980 --> 05:03.460
Well,yeah,of course. I
mean,they're all seniors.

05:03.470 --> 05:08.330
Well,um,I think Daddy and
I have to think about this.

05:09.260 --> 05:10.460
And now's not really a good time.

05:10.470 --> 05:15.330
You have to get everybody to school and Detective
Scanlon's coming to get me in 20 minutes.

05:15.340 --> 05:18.330
Can we get back to you on this
later after we think about it?

05:18.970 --> 05:23.210
Yeah,okay. I mean,I just I don't
get what there is to think about.

05:23.220 --> 05:24.740
It's just a scavenger hunt.

05:24.760 --> 05:29.230
I know,we heard you,sweetie. We
just... We just want to think.

05:30.190 --> 05:34.260
Uh,okay,well,you know, I
better get the girls to school.

05:34.750 --> 05:37.080
- Thank you,honey.
- Thank you,sweetie.

05:44.040 --> 05:45.860
So?

05:46.360 --> 05:49.690
So,I think that,uh,we're the
luckiest parents on earth.

05:49.700 --> 05:53.410
- I mean,from the moment you got sick,she's just been...
- I know.

05:53.420 --> 05:56.110
I just think it's going to
be really hard to say no.

05:57.180 --> 06:00.100
Well,we haven't said anything yet.

06:27.480 --> 06:32.220
Allison? Can I steal you for a moment?

06:33.000 --> 06:34.610
Her name's Elena Agronov.

06:34.620 --> 06:36.680
She's my housekeeper's daughter.

06:36.700 --> 06:40.230
She borrowed her mother's car to
run an errand a couple of nights ago

06:40.260 --> 06:43.180
and hasn't been seen since.

06:43.190 --> 06:45.070
Are the police looking for her?

06:45.540 --> 06:47.430
No,not yet. You know how it works.

06:47.440 --> 06:51.590
You can't file a missing persons report
until she's been gone at least 48 hours.

06:51.600 --> 06:54.340
That's why I thought I'd
print up these flyers.

06:54.360 --> 06:56.610
Get a jump on things.

06:57.680 --> 06:59.720
You know her.

06:59.750 --> 07:02.350
You think she's the kind of girl
who might be in some kind of trouble?

07:02.360 --> 07:07.700
No. No,no,no,not this girl.
She's,uh... she's pretty special.

07:07.710 --> 07:10.800
She practically grew up in
my house. Terrific student.

07:10.810 --> 07:13.930
Putting herself through
college. Accounting major.

07:14.310 --> 07:18.110
No,that,uh, that's what
has us all so concerned.

07:18.130 --> 07:20.870
This is very out of character for her.

07:26.730 --> 07:29.110
Hey,open up!

07:33.520 --> 07:37.580
Ariel,wake up! Wake up. Come on!

07:41.550 --> 07:45.200
What are you looking at? Open the door!

07:53.260 --> 07:55.360
You're dead. I'm telling Mom.

07:55.370 --> 07:59.330
And when she hears that you left your
little sisters out on the street...

07:59.360 --> 08:02.650
You're gonna be quiet
and tell me where to go.

08:02.660 --> 08:04.190
What are you talking about?

08:04.720 --> 08:09.300
We're not going anywhere, not
until Marie gets in the car.

08:09.310 --> 08:10.820
And then we're going home.

08:10.860 --> 08:12.430
And you'll tell me where that is.

08:12.460 --> 08:15.800
I said home. You know where home is.

08:19.090 --> 08:20.570
Anybody home?

08:20.600 --> 08:22.880
In here!

08:27.460 --> 08:30.410
- Only one.
- That's all I ever take.

08:32.210 --> 08:34.510
What are you doing? Looks like homework.

08:34.520 --> 08:39.010
Well,it kind of is. I'm
practicing writing my name.

08:40.130 --> 08:41.720
What a family.

08:41.760 --> 08:45.790
You don't know how to write your name
and Ariel doesn't know where she lives.

08:51.130 --> 08:53.140
- Hello?
- Can I come in?

08:59.710 --> 09:02.600
Honey,are you tired?

09:05.080 --> 09:09.320
She told you about me falling
asleep while I was waiting for her?

09:10.500 --> 09:13.790
She also said that you
drove past the house.

09:14.750 --> 09:17.500
It was stupid. I was
just playing with her.

09:20.020 --> 09:23.040
Okay,if you say so.

09:25.020 --> 09:30.290
Um,about tomorrow night, it
just... it makes me uneasy.

09:30.860 --> 09:33.740
Older boys,cars.

09:34.160 --> 09:36.690
I feel like you need some rest.

09:36.700 --> 09:39.210
Are you trying to tell me something?

09:41.290 --> 09:43.400
I just don't think it's smart.

09:43.420 --> 09:45.970
Particularly on a school night.

09:46.280 --> 09:48.520
Okay.

09:50.030 --> 09:53.420
- Okay?
- Yeah,sure,okay.

09:53.430 --> 09:55.660
I'm talking about the scavenger hunt.

09:55.680 --> 09:59.180
Yes,I heard you. You
don't think it's smart.

10:06.390 --> 10:09.150
Mom?

10:09.440 --> 10:12.470
Can I borrow some money?

10:12.480 --> 10:15.890
Well,maybe I can give you a
little advance on your allowance.

10:15.930 --> 10:17.560
How much are you thinking?

10:17.580 --> 10:20.130
Um,maybe about 200.

10:20.160 --> 10:23.570
Dollars? Are you serious?

10:23.580 --> 10:26.920
Honey,we don't have that
kind of money. You know that.

10:26.930 --> 10:29.400
Daddy doesn't even have a regular job.

10:30.620 --> 10:33.650
No,of course,you're right.

11:05.410 --> 11:07.270
I was getting nervous.

11:07.290 --> 11:11.350
I thought maybe you weren't coming. I
thought maybe I came to the wrong place.

11:16.980 --> 11:19.610
- What's this?
- You know what it is.

11:21.500 --> 11:22.970
What's this for?

11:23.000 --> 11:25.190
This is a lot more than
you usually give me.

11:26.200 --> 11:27.460
Is this for going away?

11:27.480 --> 11:29.560
Elena,we need to have a conversation.

11:29.570 --> 11:31.010
Is this why you wanted to meet here?

11:31.030 --> 11:33.480
I can't do this anymore.

11:33.490 --> 11:35.710
I don't want to do this anymore.

11:35.740 --> 11:38.370
But that's not right.
You made me promises.

11:38.380 --> 11:42.500
Yeah,I know, but now I've realized
this just doesn't work for me anymore.

11:42.510 --> 11:44.040
But you said you'd pay my rent.

11:44.060 --> 11:46.270
- I know I did.
- You said you'd pay my tuition.

11:46.280 --> 11:51.140
I know I did,Elena, and I thought
I could do it, but I can't.

11:52.130 --> 11:56.730
I'm not a rich man. I can't keep going to
the bank,the ATM, pulling out money for you.

11:57.170 --> 11:59.480
My wife's starting to
notice. The kids need things.

11:59.490 --> 12:00.530
There's somebody else?

12:00.560 --> 12:02.500
No,there's nobody else.

12:02.880 --> 12:07.500
I just... I need it to end.

12:09.410 --> 12:13.130
What about me? What about what I need?

12:13.530 --> 12:14.760
What about you?

12:14.790 --> 12:19.880
Well,I mean, you go home to your
wife, your kids,your nice house.

12:20.450 --> 12:23.970
Nothing changes for you. But me...

12:24.320 --> 12:26.500
You'll go back to dancing.

12:26.510 --> 12:29.070
Maybe you'll meet some other
guy. Maybe he'll pay your tuition.

12:29.080 --> 12:32.450
Or maybe he won't. You can't
honestly think that that's my problem?

12:32.460 --> 12:36.150
That's right. You have no problems.

12:36.630 --> 12:38.820
None of this is your doing.

12:38.850 --> 12:43.030
You bought something, you
paid for something, but now...

12:43.320 --> 12:47.580
you want out. Fine.

12:48.330 --> 12:52.270
We'll see. Maybe it'll
interest your wife.

12:52.280 --> 12:55.290
Elena,don't you even kid about that.

12:58.900 --> 13:01.090
Look at that.

13:01.810 --> 13:05.770
He's got an Achilles'
heel, and I found it.

13:05.780 --> 13:08.610
You haven't found a thing.

13:08.620 --> 13:13.030
And if you're smart,you'll take that money
I just gave you, you'll invest it wisely,

13:13.050 --> 13:17.460
and you will forget all
about me, all about us.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.800
And what if I'm stupid?

13:22.050 --> 13:27.570
What if I take all the
money, invest it wisely,

13:27.580 --> 13:30.080
and still call your wife?

13:33.600 --> 13:34.920
Oh,my God, I was kidding.

13:34.940 --> 13:37.020
- Now we've got a problem now.
- No,there's no problem.

13:37.030 --> 13:38.850
- How can I ever trust you?
- You can.

13:38.860 --> 13:41.600
- You can trust me. I would never say any...
- You don't understand.My family means everything to me.

13:41.610 --> 13:44.240
But you can. You can trust...

13:48.960 --> 13:52.400
Found her right where you said
she'd be-- the Encanto Park overlook.

13:52.420 --> 13:56.500
Somebody shot her twice, then
left her there for the coyotes.

13:56.520 --> 13:59.060
Her mother's car was
parked maybe 20 yards away.

13:59.070 --> 14:03.400
So if I put you in front of some mug books, do
you think you'd recognize the man who did this?

14:03.410 --> 14:05.420
I can try.

14:05.470 --> 14:06.830
I kind of doubt he's gonna be in there.

14:06.850 --> 14:09.640
He didn't really strike
me as a career criminal.

14:09.650 --> 14:13.620
More like a guy who's having a midlife
crisis who'd gotten in too deep.

14:13.630 --> 14:16.620
Well,do me a favor. Take a look anyway.

14:16.630 --> 14:21.130
If you come up empty,we'll run the composite
software, see if we can generate a sketch.

14:23.600 --> 14:27.640
In the meantime,I have to
get a hold of Elena's mom.

14:29.710 --> 14:32.360
Tell her that her daughter's dead.

15:03.870 --> 15:07.420
What are you doing? That's
Mom and Dad's private stuff.

15:07.560 --> 15:09.810
You're not supposed to be in there.

15:09.820 --> 15:12.630
I was just,uh,looking for my blouse.

15:12.640 --> 15:18.330
It's not in my closet, and I thought that
maybe Mom had put it in-in here by mistake.

15:18.340 --> 15:20.680
In Dad's money drawer?

15:22.810 --> 15:25.700
Fine,but you're still not
supposed to be in there.

15:32.710 --> 15:35.020
And what are you going to do about it?

15:35.030 --> 15:38.590
I don't know. I haven't
made up my mind yet.

15:43.550 --> 15:46.390
- What you eating?
- Nothing.

15:46.400 --> 15:48.690
You sure?

15:51.850 --> 15:53.800
'Cause I think you are.

15:53.830 --> 15:59.170
And I think that I heard Mom say that she
doesn't want you snacking after school.

16:01.160 --> 16:07.270
So,I guess I didn't see you do anything
if you didn't see me do anything.

16:07.280 --> 16:11.530
Yes,but,see,I didn't do anything.

16:11.660 --> 16:14.600
And neither did I.

16:21.700 --> 16:23.920
Mommy?

16:23.930 --> 16:27.670
Hey,Pumpkin. What are you doing up?

16:27.910 --> 16:30.310
I can't find Ariel.

16:30.330 --> 16:35.220
Bridgette was snoring again, so I went in
to go sleep with Ariel, but she's not there.

16:44.520 --> 16:47.120
Did you really think you were
going to get away with it?

16:47.640 --> 16:51.560
She's here. She's home. She looks fine.

16:51.570 --> 16:53.960
- I am fine.
- She is fine.

16:54.700 --> 16:55.960
I'll see you in a minute.

16:55.990 --> 16:58.820
Hey,your dad has been driving
all around town looking for you.

16:58.840 --> 17:01.360
You went to that scavenger
hunt thing,didn't you?

17:03.670 --> 17:05.400
That's it? That's all I get,a shrug?

17:05.410 --> 17:07.720
And what do you want me to say?

17:07.730 --> 17:11.770
You know everything.
So,can I just go to bed?

17:16.599 --> 17:19.400
You've been smoking,
haven't you? I mean...

17:20.109 --> 17:23.940
Smell this. You reek. And what is this?

17:23.950 --> 17:28.400
It's from the scavenger thing.
It's my team,the She Devils.

17:29.430 --> 17:31.940
Okay,give me my keys right now.

17:33.410 --> 17:35.390
You will get these back in the morning.

17:35.410 --> 17:38.630
I will get them back from you in the afternoon
when you bring the girls home from school.

17:38.660 --> 17:42.210
Forget this weekend. Forget
your allowance. You are grounded.

17:42.220 --> 17:45.350
And when your dad gets home,
he's gonna want to speak to you.

17:47.050 --> 17:49.470
Okay.

17:54.150 --> 17:56.070
So?

17:56.080 --> 17:58.450
- So?
- So,what did she say?

17:58.460 --> 18:02.310
Not a lot. And you're right.
She smells like an ashtray.

18:02.320 --> 18:03.870
How can you be so calm?

18:03.900 --> 18:06.550
I'm not calm. I'm tired.

18:07.570 --> 18:09.950
And I guess I'm relieved.

18:09.960 --> 18:12.800
- You're relieved?
- No. Look,okay,fine.

18:12.810 --> 18:15.270
Relieved is the wrong
word. I guess I'm just...

18:15.280 --> 18:18.970
whatever word you want to use
that she's home, and she's alive.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.770
She snuck out of our house.
She was smoking cigarettes.

18:21.780 --> 18:23.110
Yeah,yeah. I know.

18:23.120 --> 18:27.880
That's awful, but it's not as awful as a
lot of other things that I can think of.

18:28.550 --> 18:31.230
Well,Ariel's certainly
Daddy's little girl.

18:31.240 --> 18:32.450
What does that mean?

18:32.460 --> 18:34.350
It means how can you not be mad at her?

18:34.380 --> 18:36.030
I didn't say that I wasn't mad.

18:36.050 --> 18:38.430
I didn't say I wasn't disappointed.

18:38.440 --> 18:41.690
But she's almost 17. She's gonna
push the boundaries a little bit.

18:41.700 --> 18:43.050
And that's what she's supposed to do.

18:43.070 --> 18:44.610
Oh,she's just doing what
she's supposed to do?

18:44.620 --> 18:46.750
No. You know what I mean.

18:46.760 --> 18:49.650
When she pushes, it's
our job to push back.

18:50.210 --> 18:53.720
Hard. And we did. You
did. She's grounded.

18:54.290 --> 18:57.850
Maybe that will make her think twice
before pulling a stunt like this again.

18:57.890 --> 19:02.090
But if it doesn't,all right, fine,we'll
push back harder. All right? Okay?

19:02.490 --> 19:05.200
Did I say the right thing
yet? Can we go to sleep yet?

19:05.210 --> 19:07.760
You know what? Keep it up,buddy.

19:08.220 --> 19:10.630
I'll ground you,too.

19:23.680 --> 19:27.400
I need to see some ID, and it'd
better be damned impressive.

19:31.870 --> 19:34.050
I don't have any.

19:35.440 --> 19:38.170
But that's okay. I won't be here long.

19:38.180 --> 19:41.920
Oh,you got that right 'cause
we don't serve kids in here.

19:41.930 --> 19:45.380
Don't worry about it.
I'm not here to drink.

19:45.700 --> 19:48.390
I'm here to see you,Trent.

19:50.780 --> 19:52.380
I'm here to make a purchase.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.630
I don't know what you're talking about.

19:55.270 --> 19:57.250
We sell hugs. We don't sell drugs.

19:57.260 --> 20:01.300
And what we do sell, we don't sell to
minors, so you might want to hit the road.

20:01.740 --> 20:04.410
I'm not looking for something to shoot.

20:04.420 --> 20:07.140
I'm looking for something to shoot with.

20:08.320 --> 20:11.890
It's got some miles on it,
but it still shoots just fine.

20:14.160 --> 20:16.120
200.

20:16.150 --> 20:18.480
I got $153.

20:21.490 --> 20:24.890
Good news. We're running a special.

20:29.330 --> 20:33.930
So,uh, what's someone like
you need a gun for anyway?

20:37.820 --> 20:40.590
What do people usually need guns for?

20:40.600 --> 20:43.780
Well,sometimes it's 'cause
they got a score to make.

20:44.570 --> 20:47.590
Sometimes it's 'cause
they got a score to settle.

20:48.670 --> 20:52.230
You don't look bad enough
to be making a score.

20:52.670 --> 20:56.060
You don't look old enough
to have any scores to settle.

20:57.340 --> 21:01.000
Well,I'm older than I look.

21:04.530 --> 21:07.460
Thanks for your help... Trent.

21:08.670 --> 21:11.540
It's good to see you again.

21:12.180 --> 21:14.720
Little girl?

21:16.310 --> 21:19.080
I don't think I caught your name.

21:19.090 --> 21:22.460
Sure you did. It's Elena.

21:36.530 --> 21:40.320
Mom? What's going on?

21:40.330 --> 21:42.080
Did I wake you?

21:42.130 --> 21:45.450
I was trying not to make any noise.
I was just looking for something.

21:46.150 --> 21:48.390
Okay,what are you talking
about? What are you looking for?

21:48.400 --> 21:54.130
I thought he put it in
here but no,just cigarettes.

21:55.620 --> 21:58.380
Okay,what are you looking for?

21:58.390 --> 22:00.210
- The gun.
- What gun?

22:00.220 --> 22:02.610
I think we both know what
gun I'm talking about.

22:02.660 --> 22:04.710
The one that you bought last night
when you snuck out of the house

22:04.720 --> 22:07.340
and I thought you were
at that scavenger hunt.

22:07.380 --> 22:11.640
- Okay,Mom...
- Stop it! Don't call me that. I'm not your mom.

22:14.110 --> 22:16.020
I know who you are,Elena.

22:16.040 --> 22:19.270
I know what you're trying to do and
I'm not gonna let you get away with it.

22:19.300 --> 22:21.910
I'm not gonna let my daughter
get the blame for something

22:21.920 --> 22:24.480
that she doesn't even
know is happening to her.

22:25.200 --> 22:26.780
Where is the gun?

22:26.790 --> 22:28.110
Mom,you're crazy.

22:28.130 --> 22:31.140
- Where is that gun?
- Okay,you know what? You are crazy!

22:31.150 --> 22:32.870
Where is the gun?

22:32.900 --> 22:35.180
- Get off of me!
- I want that gun and I want my daughter back!

22:35.190 --> 22:37.810
Help! Get her off me!

22:38.750 --> 22:42.330
What the hell? What are you
doing? The hell's going on in here?

22:42.340 --> 22:46.670
- She's crazy! She's not Ariel!
- She is not our daughter,Joe!

22:46.680 --> 22:48.350
She snuck out of the house last night.

22:48.380 --> 22:50.890
She wasn't on a scavenger
hunt. She bought a gun!

22:50.900 --> 22:53.830
- A gun?
- I don't know anything about a gun!

22:53.840 --> 22:57.080
She's hidden a gun somewhere.
She's planning on killing a man.

22:57.090 --> 22:59.060
- Ariel?
- She's not Ariel!

22:59.070 --> 23:01.120
Dad,please!

23:02.190 --> 23:05.570
Okay,well,clearly you've been all through
this room and there's nothing here.

23:05.580 --> 23:09.800
So,can we just,can we let everybody just get
up and get dressed and get ready for school?

23:09.810 --> 23:12.700
She's not driving my
other daughters to school.

23:12.730 --> 23:14.720
I am!

23:14.730 --> 23:17.410
I'm driving everyone to school.

23:19.280 --> 23:21.310
Can I talk to you in our bedroom?

23:21.320 --> 23:22.960
Ask her her birthday.

23:23.000 --> 23:27.670
No,you know what, better yet, ask her the name of
her best friend who moved to Texas when she was five.

23:27.680 --> 23:29.950
I'm sorry but I'm just,
I'm-I'm not doing that.

23:29.980 --> 23:32.360
- Why not?
- 'Cause I just am not.

23:32.370 --> 23:35.310
It's my daughter. I'm
not quizzing my daughter.

23:35.320 --> 23:36.910
No,you're not listening.

23:36.940 --> 23:40.460
That's not your daughter, our
daughter. That's someone else.

23:40.470 --> 23:43.800
That's someone with a deadly agenda
who has taken over our daughter's body.

23:43.830 --> 23:46.760
I'm sorry,but that is
just not what I see.

23:46.790 --> 23:49.930
It just is not. What I
see is our little girl,

23:49.940 --> 23:53.360
a girl that I've known since the moment
that she was born crying hysterically

23:53.400 --> 23:55.540
because her mom is acting
like she's not there.

23:55.570 --> 23:57.940
- She's not.
- Where are you going?

23:57.950 --> 24:00.810
Stay away from her! Just
let her get ready for school.

24:09.660 --> 24:11.780
Let me take care of this for you.

24:12.750 --> 24:17.350
Just tell me his name. Then
you don't have to do anything.

24:17.360 --> 24:20.910
If you give me his name, the chances are
good we'll be able to put him away for life.

24:20.930 --> 24:25.390
Then you can go wherever it is you need
to go and I can have my daughter back.

24:28.960 --> 24:31.720
I don't know what you're taking about.

24:37.490 --> 24:40.110
All right,I'm going to
run the girls to school.

24:42.410 --> 24:45.030
That is not our little girl.

24:50.340 --> 24:51.970
Did you borrow some money from me?

24:51.990 --> 24:53.330
What are you talking about?

24:53.350 --> 24:56.040
I'm missing,like,$150 from my drawer.

25:05.990 --> 25:09.280
Hey,so,listen, uh,we're making
plans for your birthday next month,

25:09.290 --> 25:12.190
but the 17th falls on a,uh,
on a Wednesday this year.

25:12.220 --> 25:15.300
Do you want to do something that night
or you want to wait for the weekend?

25:15.310 --> 25:19.290
Dad,my birthday's not until spring.

25:20.200 --> 25:23.870
Right. Well,you wait.

25:23.880 --> 25:26.600
You have three kids of your own
with three different birthdays

25:26.610 --> 25:28.910
and see if you don't
start mixing and matching.

25:29.170 --> 25:31.350
Whatever you say.

25:34.370 --> 25:36.590
And one other thing.

25:39.080 --> 25:42.260
You didn't happen to go
into my dresser,did you?

25:42.270 --> 25:44.530
Last day or two?

25:45.420 --> 25:48.190
Um,actually,I did.

25:48.220 --> 25:51.210
I was looking for a
blouse. A T-shirt,really.

25:51.220 --> 25:56.080
And I thought that maybe Mommy had
gotten mixed up and put it in your room.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.200
Bye.

26:16.580 --> 26:20.130
Can I help you? I'm the manager.

26:22.440 --> 26:24.570
My name is Allison Dubois.

26:24.580 --> 26:29.930
I'm with the District Attorney's office
and I'm here investigating a report that

26:29.950 --> 26:33.070
an underage girl was in your
establishment two nights ago,

26:33.120 --> 26:36.870
which is a clear violation of
your adult entertainment license.

26:36.880 --> 26:40.950
We also have reason to believe that
this girl purchased an illegal firearm

26:40.960 --> 26:42.990
while she was in your establishment.

26:43.540 --> 26:46.390
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

26:46.810 --> 26:49.770
I'm thinking you might want
to speak to my attorney.

26:49.780 --> 26:53.520
Why don't you just take a look at this
girl and see if this jogs your memory?

26:54.360 --> 26:57.970
Wait a minute. You're in the
picture too. What,are you her mother?

26:58.520 --> 27:00.500
I thought you said
you were with the D.A.

27:00.520 --> 27:02.410
What,is this some kind of joke?

27:02.420 --> 27:05.590
No,this is no joke. There's
nothing funny about this.

27:05.600 --> 27:09.140
Yes,I'm her mother and I'm with
the District Attorney's office.

27:09.150 --> 27:11.170
You think you're in trouble now?

27:11.200 --> 27:15.570
If that girl hurts anyone with
that gun, you're an accessory.

27:16.270 --> 27:21.120
I just wanted to make sure that
this place existed. That you existed.

28:07.620 --> 28:10.370
Excuse me? Can I help you?

28:11.040 --> 28:13.540
Why are you on my lawn
staring into my house?

28:14.230 --> 28:16.690
I'm so sorry. My name's Allison Dubois.

28:16.700 --> 28:19.620
Uh,my daughter Ariel's
inside your house.

28:20.940 --> 28:25.480
Mom? What's going on?
What are you doing here?

28:26.930 --> 28:29.480
Did you follow me here?

28:29.500 --> 28:32.320
Oh,my God,I cannot believe
that you followed me here.

28:32.850 --> 28:35.260
I'm so sorry.My daughter,Ariel,

28:35.270 --> 28:38.710
was grounded and she was supposed
to come straight home from school.

28:38.720 --> 28:43.060
Okay,you know what? Mom,stop
it,okay? This is Devin.

28:43.800 --> 28:45.110
Okay,she's helping me with chemistry.

28:45.140 --> 28:48.680
We have a chemistry test in
three days and we were studying.

28:49.020 --> 28:54.230
And I am so sorry, but I didn't realize
that studying was a violation of my sentence.

28:54.240 --> 28:56.150
I'm sorry,Devin.

28:56.190 --> 28:59.110
I'm sorry,but she was
supposed to come straight home.

28:59.650 --> 29:04.980
She really hasn't been herself lately and her father
and I just felt like we really needed to buckle down.

29:05.780 --> 29:08.450
So,come on. Get your
things. We're gonna go.

29:11.220 --> 29:14.360
Well,I think she's clear now
on what it means to be grounded.

29:14.380 --> 29:15.430
I'm gonna go talk to her.

29:15.460 --> 29:17.840
Uh,let's not and say we did.

29:19.920 --> 29:22.060
Who are you protecting here?

29:22.500 --> 29:24.950
The girl that's in that
room is not our daughter.

29:25.540 --> 29:27.760
Okay,whatever you say,Allison.

29:29.710 --> 29:31.470
Are you patronizing me?

29:31.500 --> 29:35.170
No,I'm not patronizing
you. I'm pleading with you.

29:35.180 --> 29:37.080
Knock it off!

29:37.110 --> 29:41.260
Whoever you think she is, she
lives in our house under our roof

29:41.270 --> 29:43.880
and she looks like our daughter to me.

29:44.410 --> 29:47.630
And the fact remains, the only
crime that she has committed today

29:47.640 --> 29:51.070
is going out to some girl's
house to study chemistry.

29:51.420 --> 29:54.580
So,what do you say? As a favor
to me, can we just knock it off?

29:54.590 --> 29:57.440
Leave it. Give it a rest.

30:19.190 --> 30:21.910
Kevin? Are you still outside?

30:21.920 --> 30:24.540
Be right in.

30:30.400 --> 30:33.710
Sorry. I was tidying up the yard.

30:38.760 --> 30:41.740
Kevin,aren't you forgetting something?

30:46.000 --> 30:49.870
Bless us,oh,Lord, for these thy
gifts which we are about to receive

30:49.880 --> 30:53.470
from thy bounty through
Christ our Lord. Amen.

31:08.420 --> 31:11.980
I know who shot you. And I can prove it.

31:14.380 --> 31:17.520
I know where the gun is,
the one he used to do it.

31:17.780 --> 31:20.710
I can bring him to justice. I can.

31:21.390 --> 31:24.450
And that means you don't
have to kill anybody.

31:30.100 --> 31:33.010
Just tell me where
you're hiding the gun.

31:33.050 --> 31:35.610
The one you're planning
on doing it with.

31:37.510 --> 31:41.590
Please give me Ariel back.

31:45.290 --> 31:51.680
The day before yesterday, while
you thought I was at school...

31:57.300 --> 32:00.450
I went to see my mother.

32:03.910 --> 32:07.820
I stood across the street
from our apartment...

32:09.990 --> 32:14.720
and I watched as she went to church

32:14.740 --> 32:18.750
and lit a candle...for me.

32:23.390 --> 32:28.810
I didn't realize that a single
human could hold so many tears.

32:32.120 --> 32:35.300
I'm dead,Allison.

32:36.930 --> 32:40.190
And do you know why?

32:42.390 --> 32:47.970
Because a man who was
willing to say anything,

32:48.360 --> 32:53.480
do anything, spend
anything to have me...

32:56.920 --> 32:59.820
woke up one day...

33:02.230 --> 33:05.530
and realized that he was tired of me.

33:08.410 --> 33:12.000
I am not a stupid girl,Allison.

33:12.710 --> 33:16.810
I know the meaning of justice.

33:18.480 --> 33:21.290
And soon...

33:22.600 --> 33:25.340
so will that man.

33:29.380 --> 33:31.510
- Hey,Dev?
- Yeah?

33:31.520 --> 33:33.950
Can I get a ride home from school today?

33:33.960 --> 33:36.590
I don't have my car today,
but we'll give you a ride home,

33:36.600 --> 33:39.690
long as you don't mind
being seen with my dorky dad.

34:02.460 --> 34:05.810
Ariel Dubois? Hey,Ariel.

34:05.820 --> 34:08.100
Are you talking to me?

34:08.380 --> 34:11.639
I'm Detective Lee Scanlon. I work
with your mother. You know me.

34:15.750 --> 34:19.810
I'm gonna need you to come with me. The district
attorney has a few questions he'd like to ask you.

34:29.900 --> 34:32.350
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Yeah.

34:32.710 --> 34:35.710
I mean, I don't get it. I've
been here for over an hour.

34:35.719 --> 34:38.810
I mean,I know I'm only 16,
but don't I have rights?

34:38.820 --> 34:40.630
Of course you have rights.

34:40.639 --> 34:44.770
Okay,well,aren't I supposed
to know why I'm being held?

34:44.790 --> 34:46.270
Aren't I entitled to a lawyer?

34:46.300 --> 34:48.920
Don't I get a phone call or something?

34:48.929 --> 34:53.739
Absolutely. You're entitled to all those things
if you were being held, but you are not being held.

34:53.750 --> 34:56.659
I'm sorry if that
wasn't made clear to you.

34:56.690 --> 35:00.460
You're here because you're a
friend, because I want to help you.

35:01.790 --> 35:05.950
But if you don't want my help, you
are free to leave at any time you like.

35:07.380 --> 35:09.610
Okay,well...

35:10.420 --> 35:12.690
Of course if you do leave,
I will have you arrested.

35:12.710 --> 35:14.880
Probably start with a
concealed weapons charge.

35:14.920 --> 35:17.930
That gun that was found in your purse when
you went through the metal detector outside.

35:17.970 --> 35:19.160
Pretty
open-and-shut case.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.510
I never saw that gun before.

35:21.530 --> 35:24.890
Okay,the man behind me in line
must have slipped it into my bag.

35:26.590 --> 35:30.810
Sounds plausible, but that's not
the gun I want to discuss with you.

35:39.780 --> 35:43.380
- What's that?
- This? This is a murder weapon.

35:45.260 --> 35:47.560
It was used to kill a girl...

35:49.080 --> 35:53.180
a woman named Elena
Agronov. Ever heard of her?

35:56.220 --> 35:58.050
No.

35:58.920 --> 36:02.370
Well,that's curious because we
received an anonymous tip this morning.

36:02.390 --> 36:05.850
The caller told us exactly
where to find this gun.

36:05.860 --> 36:08.470
Told us to look in your
bedroom under your mattress.

36:08.490 --> 36:11.710
We found it about two hours ago right
where the caller said it would be.

36:11.890 --> 36:15.260
What? How is that even possible?

36:15.270 --> 36:17.760
There's something else you need to know.

36:17.770 --> 36:21.570
When we were in your room, we
took some hair from your hairbrush.

36:21.580 --> 36:24.880
We have forensics comparing it
to the DNA on some blonde hairs

36:24.920 --> 36:27.510
that were recently discovered
on Ms.Agronov's body.

36:27.530 --> 36:30.330
What? What are you talking about?

36:30.340 --> 36:34.430
How could my hair end up
on some stranger's body?

36:34.440 --> 36:40.300
If the DNA is a match-- and I'm
beginning to suspect that it might be--

36:40.310 --> 36:43.640
we'll have you connected to the scene of
the crime, as well as the murder weapon,

36:43.650 --> 36:47.160
and I will be forced to charge
you with first degree murder.

36:47.700 --> 36:50.230
I wanted to speak to you
before I'm compelled to do that.

36:50.240 --> 36:52.700
I want to make you a proposition.

36:53.480 --> 36:56.440
Confess to the murder of Elena Agronov,

36:56.470 --> 37:00.200
and I promise you that you will
spend no more than 25 years in prison.

37:00.230 --> 37:06.040
But you put this office, you put your
mother, through the pain of prosecuting you,

37:06.070 --> 37:10.490
and I guarantee you, you will spend
the rest of your life behind bars.

37:10.500 --> 37:13.260
- This is my mother.
- Excuse me?

37:14.840 --> 37:17.440
This is my mother.

37:17.990 --> 37:21.650
My mother did this. Okay?

37:21.660 --> 37:25.240
She planted that gun.
She planted the hair.

37:25.250 --> 37:28.460
Ariel,why would your mother do
this? Why would any mother do that?

37:28.470 --> 37:35.610
Okay,look,I don't know what she has told you,
but I have never heard of this dead woman.

37:35.910 --> 37:39.190
I have never seen that gun
before. Any gun,for that matter.

37:39.200 --> 37:42.930
So,please,can you please call my
father, and he can clear all of this up?

37:42.950 --> 37:44.430
I'm happy to call whomever you like,

37:44.450 --> 37:48.220
but you need to know that there was no one
more distraught when we showed up at your door

37:48.230 --> 37:50.620
- with a search warrant than your mother.
- Right.

37:51.450 --> 37:54.330
I am sure that she was beside herself.

37:55.650 --> 38:00.320
Okay,look,I am trying to tell you
that she has been acting crazy lately.

38:01.860 --> 38:07.940
Devalos. I see. Thank you.

38:09.030 --> 38:13.600
Forensics. Preliminary DNA
report is back. It's a match.

38:21.090 --> 38:24.730
I'm sorry that you
don't want my help,Ariel.

38:25.490 --> 38:28.240
I'll get a hold of your folks,
let them know what's going on,

38:28.830 --> 38:31.300
tell them to start
looking for an attorney.

38:31.730 --> 38:34.110
I'll be back shortly
with an arrest warrant.

38:34.120 --> 38:36.590
We'll read you your rights
and take you to processing.

38:36.600 --> 38:41.280
No,no,no,no,no,no. Wait. You have to
believe me. I haven't killed anybody!

38:42.920 --> 38:48.680
Get off of me! Get off me. Get off me!

39:18.040 --> 39:20.230
So what happens now?

39:21.320 --> 39:26.300
I don't know. I'm sorry,Elena.
I couldn't let you kill a man.

39:26.310 --> 39:29.980
So you framed me for my own murder?

39:30.000 --> 39:32.300
What choice did you give me?

39:32.310 --> 39:35.460
I couldn't let you turn
my child into a killer.

39:35.470 --> 39:42.490
Your child is going to prison
for the rest of her life.

39:42.500 --> 39:46.270
No,she's not. No. You are.

39:48.130 --> 39:51.280
What are we doing here,Allison?

39:52.810 --> 39:54.550
Playing a game of chicken?

39:54.570 --> 39:59.260
Because,obviously, I'm
not going to prison.

40:01.360 --> 40:05.410
Obviously,if you force me to,
I will give up your daughter,

40:05.430 --> 40:12.010
but I promise you that I will do
it at the last possible second.

40:12.040 --> 40:16.270
I will wait until I'm behind bars,

40:16.280 --> 40:19.030
and I'll make notes

40:19.040 --> 40:24.120
so that she understands
exactly how it happened.

40:24.130 --> 40:25.430
And you...

40:25.470 --> 40:32.300
you will spend years trying to get her
out, as she suffers through that hell,

40:32.310 --> 40:36.870
knowing that it was
you who put her there.

40:38.380 --> 40:40.000
Allison,I need you to step outside.

40:40.020 --> 40:41.740
We have an arrest
warrant for your daughter.

40:41.780 --> 40:44.560
Oh,wait. One moment,please.

40:49.550 --> 40:52.330
I'm doing this for you,too,Elena.

40:52.630 --> 40:58.010
So you can go wherever it is you need
to go without any blood on your hands.

40:58.760 --> 41:04.300
And for your mother, so she can go into
that church, and she can light those candles,

41:04.310 --> 41:07.150
and they can mean something.

41:07.610 --> 41:10.110
What are you doing?

41:10.420 --> 41:14.210
I'm not going... anywhere.

41:24.470 --> 41:26.370
Come in.

41:32.290 --> 41:34.710
Ariel Dubois, you're under arrest.

41:34.720 --> 41:36.080
You have the right to remain silent.

41:36.110 --> 41:38.950
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

41:38.960 --> 41:41.100
You have the right to an attorney
present during questioning.

41:41.120 --> 41:43.970
If you can't afford one, one
will be appointed for you.

41:44.850 --> 41:47.710
- Do you understand these rights?
- Sure.

41:59.390 --> 42:02.180
Please.

42:30.190 --> 42:32.940
- Elena?
- Ariel?

42:32.950 --> 42:35.370
- Ariel?
- Mom?

42:36.630 --> 42:39.950
- Ariel?
- What's going on? How did I get here?

42:55.300 --> 42:58.650
Did it work? Looks like it worked.

42:59.090 --> 43:02.350
Worked perfectly. We
have our little girl home.

43:08.470 --> 43:09.540
Mom,I think I know that man.

43:09.570 --> 43:12.030
I think he's the,uh,dad of
one of the girls at school.

43:12.060 --> 43:13.870
Did he do something wrong?

43:13.890 --> 43:16.630
He did,but that doesn't concern us.

43:16.650 --> 43:20.320
Absolutely. No, that
does not concern us.
