- Immigration?
- Revenue agent: Revenue.

00:24.780 --> 00:28.950
Missus Rose! There are people
here from the government!

(Rushed footsteps thud)

00:33.455 --> 00:35.622
<i>(Moira screams shrilly)</i>

00:35.656 --> 00:38.358
I've been gutted!

00:38.393 --> 00:40.360
John, I've been stripped
of every morsel of pleasure

00:40.395 --> 00:43.097
I earned in this life!

00:43.131 --> 00:44.431
Johnny: Well, how do
you think I feel, Moira?!

00:44.466 --> 00:46.967
Eli was family, for God's sake!

00:47.001 --> 00:50.269
Leave your finances to me,
he said! Son of a bitch!

00:50.304 --> 00:51.537
Alexis: Baby, it's crazy,
people are just like,

00:51.572 --> 00:53.974
taking our stuff!

00:54.008 --> 00:56.643
I said, they're taking our stuff!

00:56.677 --> 00:59.079
Can you just step out of
the club for a second, ple...

00:59.113 --> 01:01.314
Hold on, hold on! Those
bags are not for you,

01:01.348 --> 01:02.882
my boyfriend bought those for me,

01:02.917 --> 01:04.918
so, theoretically, they are his!

01:04.952 --> 01:07.186
Revenue agent 1: Please
sir, can you step aside?

01:07.221 --> 01:10.123
David: No, you step aside! You step aside!

01:10.157 --> 01:11.524
I'm still trying to wrap my mind around

01:11.558 --> 01:13.459
what kind of a sick
person wants to get paid

01:13.494 --> 01:15.628
to destroy another person's life!

01:15.662 --> 01:18.998
Destroy another person's life!

01:19.032 --> 01:20.433
Where are you taking that?!

01:20.467 --> 01:23.168
My very soul has been kidnapped,

01:23.202 --> 01:26.138
there's no ransom, no
one's coming to save me!

01:26.172 --> 01:27.740
Johnny: We've got 15 minutes
to collect our personals,

01:27.774 --> 01:30.375
- can we pick up the pace?!
- Moira: No, no!

01:30.409 --> 01:32.577
Did you put Kristen with Robin?
They don't like each other!

01:32.612 --> 01:36.381
Nooooo! Nooooo! (Sobbing)

01:36.415 --> 01:38.216
Lawyer: Eli really did a number, Johnny.

01:38.251 --> 01:40.519
He took everything.

01:40.553 --> 01:42.854
They're still looking for him,
they think he's in the Caymans.

01:42.888 --> 01:44.889
He was our business manager,
he's supposed to pay taxes!

01:44.923 --> 01:47.159
Hmm.

01:47.193 --> 01:49.727
There is a very small
amount set aside for you,

01:49.762 --> 01:52.197
and one asset the government
has allowed you to retain.

01:52.231 --> 01:54.999
The kids.

01:55.034 --> 01:59.403
Lawyer: The children are dependents, Moira.

01:59.437 --> 02:03.340
You bought a small town in 1991, Johnny.

02:03.375 --> 02:06.510
Yes, I bought that as a joke for my son.

02:06.545 --> 02:09.580
Wait, you actually purchased that town?

02:09.614 --> 02:13.217
Yes, I purchased the town,
how else could I get the deed?

02:13.251 --> 02:15.952
- Alexis: You could've photo shopped the deed!
- David: And saved the money!

02:15.987 --> 02:18.556
Why would I Photoshop a deed,
the joke was owning the town!

02:18.590 --> 02:19.890
- Moira: Okay, stop.
- Johnny: That was the joke!

02:19.924 --> 02:21.058
- David: Oh my God!
- Johnny: Well, that was the joke!

02:21.092 --> 02:23.427
<i>Lawyer: To Johnny's credit... </i>

02:23.461 --> 02:26.930
<i>This town just might be your
saving grace, at least for a while.</i>

02:26.964 --> 02:28.432
Moira: What do you mean?

02:28.466 --> 02:29.733
You can live there for next to nothing,

02:29.767 --> 02:31.501
until you get back on your feet.

02:31.535 --> 02:33.436
I'm sure there's a
penthouse we can move into,

02:33.470 --> 02:35.906
please, there are other options.

02:35.940 --> 02:37.841
Well, homelessness is still on the table.

02:42.513 --> 02:51.987

02:52.022 --> 02:55.491
<i>Alexis: The whole time I was
surrounded by old women wearing visors,</i>

02:55.526 --> 02:58.328
<i>who smelled like yams!</i>

02:58.362 --> 03:00.830
There was nowhere to lie down!

03:00.864 --> 03:02.531
There was nowhere to lie
down, there was no bed!

03:02.565 --> 03:04.266
There was no kitchen.

03:04.300 --> 03:06.335
<i>I know!</i>

03:06.369 --> 03:09.038
<i>No.</i>

03:09.072 --> 03:10.305
<i>I don't know what to
tell you, there's like,</i>

03:10.340 --> 03:13.142
cows all over the place, like, everywhere.

03:13.176 --> 03:15.310
<i>I don't know if there's even a station,</i>

03:15.345 --> 03:17.246

(Clears throat) Johnny Rose!

03:21.317 --> 03:23.552
Roland Schitt.

03:23.586 --> 03:25.487
Oh, you're the mayor
we're supposed to meet.

03:25.521 --> 03:27.589
That's right, I'm the mayor,

03:27.624 --> 03:29.458
so if you're looking for
an ass to kiss, it's mine!

03:29.492 --> 03:32.261
(Chortles)

03:32.295 --> 03:35.730
Oh, this is my family, my son...

03:35.765 --> 03:37.065
Let's get you all squared away
in the office there, Johnny,

03:37.099 --> 03:39.134
okay, the gals can grab the bags,

03:39.168 --> 03:40.468
you follow me, all right, right this way,

03:40.502 --> 03:42.837
watch it, honey, here we come.

03:42.872 --> 03:44.639
<i>Alexis: The "Cheaters" marathon
we watched, it's like that.</i>

03:44.673 --> 03:46.574
Moira: Children, keep an eye on these bags.

03:46.608 --> 03:50.478
Apparently in hell, there's no bellman!

03:50.512 --> 03:52.813
- Alexis: David, what are we...
- David: Shut up!

03:52.847 --> 03:54.548
- Alexis: You shut up!
- David: You shut up!

03:54.583 --> 03:59.287
- Alexis: Um, you shut up!
- David: You shhhut up!

03:59.321 --> 04:01.422
The name is Rose.

04:01.456 --> 04:04.258
I don't see a reservation under that name.

04:04.293 --> 04:06.727
It's okay, Stevie, I set
aside two rooms for them.

04:06.762 --> 04:08.762
Well, there's nothing here.

04:08.797 --> 04:10.563
Well okay, fine, just
book 'em in with two rooms,

04:10.598 --> 04:12.866
these people own the
town; They're big deals.

04:12.901 --> 04:14.734
We'll need three rooms, minimum.

04:14.769 --> 04:17.036
Roland: Ooh, no can do, honey.

04:17.071 --> 04:19.738
Look, we have a one room comp policy here,

04:19.774 --> 04:22.876
and I am personally throwing in an
extra room out of sheer decency, so...

04:22.911 --> 04:24.944
What about suites? Do you
have a couple of suites?

04:24.978 --> 04:26.279
This guy!

04:26.314 --> 04:27.980
Um...

04:28.015 --> 04:31.584
No, this is a motel,

04:31.619 --> 04:35.087
so we cater more to off road
truckers and drunk teenagers.

04:35.122 --> 04:38.157
Moira: Please, someone just
give me a key, to a door,

04:38.192 --> 04:41.593
to a room any room! I just want a bathtub,

04:41.628 --> 04:44.763
and a long extension cord, please.

04:44.798 --> 04:46.966
<i>Roland: There you go, ma'am.</i>

04:47.000 --> 04:49.368

04:52.005 --> 04:54.006
It smells like a gym bag.

04:54.041 --> 04:56.408
Moira: Does anyone else feel light headed?

04:56.443 --> 05:00.011
<i>Roland: Oh my God, this
takes me back to high school.</i>

05:00.046 --> 05:03.515
You know, I did the deed in just
about every room in this place.

05:03.550 --> 05:05.984
Yep, if a forensic team came in here

05:06.018 --> 05:08.220
with one of those blue lights,
this place would just light up!

05:08.254 --> 05:10.456
Okay, that's good.

05:10.490 --> 05:12.257
- Alexis: Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!
- David: Oh my God. Oh my God!

05:12.291 --> 05:14.659
Oh hey, chief, the other
room's right through there.

05:19.565 --> 05:21.566
<i>Moira: And there's the bed,</i>

05:21.600 --> 05:25.837
I should probably pull off
that cover, and... burn it.

05:25.872 --> 05:28.340
Roland: All right.

05:28.374 --> 05:32.543
Good, Roland, thank you very
much, appreciate everything, uh...

Okay. Okay. I love you!

06:02.207 --> 06:06.676
Oh, okay, well, it looks
like you got all the channels

06:06.711 --> 06:09.613
<i>except for Channel 19 for
some reason. I don't know why.</i>

06:09.647 --> 06:11.548
Well, the thing is we won't be
watching a lot of television,

06:11.582 --> 06:14.284
but again, thank you,

06:14.318 --> 06:16.820

I know you're a busy man.

Hi.

06:38.007 --> 06:40.108
Can I help you?

06:40.143 --> 06:41.710
- David: I'm looking for an extra towel,
- Stevie: Okay...

06:41.745 --> 06:43.412
And this might be a stupid question,

06:43.447 --> 06:45.448
considering the state
of the rugs in our room,

06:45.482 --> 06:49.919
but do you have a business centre here?

06:49.953 --> 06:53.221
Yes, we do have a business center.

06:53.256 --> 06:55.123
You can find it right outside
the doors to your left,

06:55.158 --> 06:58.760
right beside the hammam spa.

06:58.794 --> 07:00.028
Would you like me to book you
a treatment while you're at it?

07:00.063 --> 07:01.997
David: Thank you, no,
just the towel, thanks.

07:02.031 --> 07:03.932
I'll get those right out.

07:03.967 --> 07:05.500
(Gunshots, dramatic music on television)

07:08.171 --> 07:10.037
Well Roland, once again,
thank you for giving us

07:10.072 --> 07:11.606
the lay of the land here,

07:11.640 --> 07:13.708
but we have some serious unpacking to do.

07:13.742 --> 07:16.344
- Oh, sure!
- Johnny: If you don't mind.

07:16.378 --> 07:18.913
No problem there, Johnny,
I don't mind helpin' out.

07:18.948 --> 07:21.315
Listen, one thing before I go here, um...

07:23.552 --> 07:25.386
Do you mind if I use your toilet?

07:27.722 --> 07:31.792
Moira: Is it absolutely necessary?

07:31.826 --> 07:34.161
Roland: Uh, yeah, I would
say it's absolutely necessary!

07:36.465 --> 07:37.764
(Laughs) Excuse me.

07:37.799 --> 07:39.733
Absolutely necessary.

07:39.767 --> 07:42.003
Yes, that train has left the station,

07:42.037 --> 07:44.037
if you know what I mean! (Chuckles)

07:46.941 --> 07:49.843
- David: I need that bed.
- Alexis: Why?

07:49.878 --> 07:51.177
- David: Because I need it.
- Alexis: Why?

07:51.212 --> 07:52.713
Because if someone were to break in here

07:52.747 --> 07:53.881
in the middle of the
night wanting to murder us,

07:53.915 --> 07:55.248
they would attack this bed first,

07:55.282 --> 07:57.918
so I need this bed.

07:57.952 --> 08:00.453
So you're saying that you
want me to get murdered first?!

08:00.488 --> 08:02.522
In front of you? And
then what would you do?

08:02.556 --> 08:04.391
Would you just run away
and leave me to bleed out...

08:04.425 --> 08:06.192
On the floor?!

08:06.227 --> 08:09.362
Uh, sort of, that was the plan, yeah.

08:09.397 --> 08:11.864
Alexis: Okay. Well, you can
have the bed when I leave.

08:11.899 --> 08:14.434
David: Well, where are you going?

08:14.468 --> 08:15.735
Alexis: Stavros is flying in
to get me, I told you that.

08:15.769 --> 08:18.905
What do you mean Stavros is com...

08:18.939 --> 08:21.007
What do you mean? When?
When is he doing that?

08:21.041 --> 08:23.042
Like, whenever stupid Mary-Kate
stops hogging his plane.

08:23.076 --> 08:26.211
Well, where are we going?

08:26.246 --> 08:30.182
Okay, at present, he's just coming for me,

08:30.216 --> 08:32.051
but then I figured that
we would just come back

08:32.085 --> 08:35.087
and grab you guys at some point.

08:35.121 --> 08:38.323
What kind of sociopath abandons her
family in some vomit soaked dump,

08:40.860 --> 08:43.429
to gallivant around the world

08:43.462 --> 08:45.464
with her dumb shipping heir loser boyfriend

08:45.498 --> 08:47.999
she's known for three months?!

08:48.034 --> 08:50.669
Um, David, it will be
four months next month!

08:50.703 --> 08:53.004
Oh my God!

08:53.039 --> 08:56.207
And he just told me that he
could potentially see himself

08:56.241 --> 08:57.642
considering saying "I love you"

08:57.677 --> 08:59.978
at some point sometime soon, so...

09:00.012 --> 09:01.546
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

09:01.581 --> 09:03.381
I'm telling mom. I'm telling
mom and dad, have you told them?

09:03.415 --> 09:06.084
Alexis: No! No David, I'm
waiting for the right opportunity.

09:06.118 --> 09:08.119
Okay, otherwise dad's gonna cry,

09:08.153 --> 09:09.987
and mom's gonna do that thing

09:10.021 --> 09:11.689
where she pretends that nothing's wrong,

09:11.723 --> 09:13.057
and then just doesn't
talk to me for five months,

09:13.092 --> 09:14.125
and I don't want that.

09:14.159 --> 09:17.628
Well, I need this bed! I need it, so.

09:17.662 --> 09:19.863
You know what, David?!

09:19.898 --> 09:21.899
You get murdered first for once!

09:21.933 --> 09:24.001
No, you get murdered first!

09:24.035 --> 09:26.303
David, you get murdered first!

09:26.337 --> 09:28.438
David: No, you! You do it!

09:28.473 --> 09:30.808
Alexis: Yes, you get murdered
first! David, you get murdered first!

09:38.449 --> 09:40.417
(Door creaks open)

09:42.587 --> 09:45.054
I actually think this place is kinda cute.

09:45.089 --> 09:47.190
Moira: Did you say cute?

09:47.225 --> 09:50.693
No Alexis, Martha Stewart's
Hampton home is cute.

09:52.997 --> 09:54.998
David: Where's that weird man?

09:55.032 --> 09:58.067
Where?

09:58.102 --> 09:59.636
He's in the bathroom.

09:59.670 --> 10:01.938
He... he won't leave!

10:01.972 --> 10:03.840
Well, he's been in there
for a very long ti...

10:03.874 --> 10:06.843
- Oh my God! Oh my God!

10:06.877 --> 10:10.179
Roland: Jeez. Um... Boy.

10:10.213 --> 10:11.713
Remind me to get that window fixed.

10:11.748 --> 10:13.749
It will not open.

10:13.783 --> 10:15.551
Roland, listen, thank you very much,

10:15.585 --> 10:17.453
but I appreciate everything you've done,

10:17.487 --> 10:21.089
we need a little private
time now, as a family.

10:21.124 --> 10:25.093
Sure, well actually, those
curtains do close there so...

10:25.128 --> 10:27.796
Oh, look! You've got Channel 19!

10:27.830 --> 10:31.299
Roland, could you get the fuck out?!

10:31.333 --> 10:34.036
<i>T.V. announcer: This latest model
is a revelation in innovation.</i>

10:34.070 --> 10:36.538
<i>I am not lying folks, it's
gonna last you a lifetime.</i>

10:36.572 --> 10:40.508
<i>- You are gonna thank...
- (TV clicks off)</i>

10:40.543 --> 10:44.345
That was an overreaction.
That was uncalled for.

10:44.380 --> 10:47.081
It's just... you know, we're a little tired,

10:47.115 --> 10:49.617
it's been a long day,

10:49.652 --> 10:52.620
there's a pharmacy worth
of drugs wearing off

10:52.655 --> 10:54.689
on most of us right now,
and I just think as a family,

10:54.723 --> 10:56.757
we just need a little time to chill.

10:56.792 --> 11:00.027
Johnny, please, you
don't have to apologize,

11:00.062 --> 11:01.662
and you really don't have
to hit me over the head

11:01.697 --> 11:03.530
with this sort of thing, I get it,

11:03.565 --> 11:05.933
you need your little family
time and all that, I'm sure.

11:05.967 --> 11:07.902
No problem.

11:07.936 --> 11:10.671
You know what I'll do, I'll um...

11:10.706 --> 11:13.941
I'll just get the fuck out of here.

11:18.446 --> 11:21.014
(Door slams, shade rattles forcefully)

11:28.396 --> 11:30.197
<i>David: Ugh, we have to eat in here?!</i>

11:30.231 --> 11:32.866
Alexis: I think it's kinda sweet.

11:32.900 --> 11:35.969
Alexis, what's going on with you?

11:36.003 --> 11:38.839
- Alexis: What do you mean?
- Moira: Seriously?!

11:38.873 --> 11:40.974
The room was "cute," this place is "sweet."

11:41.008 --> 11:43.076
David: I am personally
offended by this place,

11:43.110 --> 11:45.712
I don't know what you
think is nice about it.

11:45.746 --> 11:49.582
Moira: The town is
disgusting. It is gruesome.

11:49.616 --> 11:54.287
Alexis: It is charming, it is
quaint, it's like out of a storybook.

11:54.321 --> 11:58.257
Alexis, what the hell
is the matter with you?!

11:58.292 --> 12:02.295
Okay... Stavros is flying in to get me,

12:02.329 --> 12:04.397
and I am going to go live
with him for a little bit.

12:04.431 --> 12:06.699
Well, that is not happening.

12:06.733 --> 12:08.834
And I am appalled that my baby girl

12:08.869 --> 12:11.604
has turned into a
selfish, duplicitous whore!

12:11.638 --> 12:13.739
Oh, hello!

12:13.773 --> 12:16.475
Twyla: Hi, I'm Twyla. I'll
be your waitress today.

12:16.510 --> 12:19.277
Anyway, I read about you guys,

12:19.312 --> 12:21.714
and everything you've gone
through, it sounds super crappy.

12:21.748 --> 12:23.681
Super crappy?

12:23.716 --> 12:25.550
I had a second cousin in Elmdale

12:25.584 --> 12:28.053
<i>who did telemarketing,
he made a ton of money.</i>

12:28.087 --> 12:29.587
It turns out his entire
business was illegal,

12:29.622 --> 12:31.089
and he lost everything.

12:31.124 --> 12:33.725
Hm... not quite the same.

12:33.759 --> 12:36.428
Yeah, no, he went to prison,
which is terrible, but...

12:36.462 --> 12:40.031
But he is learning
Spanish, no mas, le duele!

12:40.065 --> 12:42.099
I think it means, "stop, it hurts."

12:42.134 --> 12:44.402
Oh, wonderful anecdote.

12:44.436 --> 12:45.870
Could you give us a moment please?

12:45.905 --> 12:48.272
Whenever you're ready,
I'm just right over here.

12:48.306 --> 12:51.009
I forbid you to abandon our family.

12:51.043 --> 12:52.944
I am a grown woman, mother.

12:52.978 --> 12:54.846
This is an act of a spoiled child!

12:54.880 --> 12:58.115
I think it's unforgivable!

12:58.150 --> 12:59.417
Alexis: I think that
you're just super jealous,

12:59.451 --> 13:02.086
'cause I'm getting out of here!

13:02.120 --> 13:04.355
Also, you have a big thing
of dandruff on your eyebrow.

13:04.389 --> 13:06.123
- David: Don't do that!
- Johnny: Kids, stop, stop!

13:06.158 --> 13:08.025
Moira: The world is falling
apart around us John,

13:08.060 --> 13:10.428
and I'm dying inside.

13:10.462 --> 13:12.629
Johnny: Well, I'm feeling
a little queasy myself.

13:12.664 --> 13:15.298
Oh, brisket!

13:15.332 --> 13:16.900
- David: Give me... some spale!
- Alexis: David!

13:24.141 --> 13:26.777
Moira: John...

13:26.811 --> 13:28.611
- Moira: Oh my God!
- Alexis: Umm...

13:32.783 --> 13:35.418
These rooms did have doors, didn't they?

13:35.453 --> 13:37.120
Yeah, it's a hotel, they're hotel rooms!

13:37.154 --> 13:39.922
It's a motel! These are motel rooms.

13:39.957 --> 13:42.024
What if they took our stuff?!

13:42.059 --> 13:43.726
David: What stuff?
There's no stuff to take.

13:43.760 --> 13:45.027
I have stuff!

13:47.230 --> 13:50.032
Son of a bitch!

13:54.237 --> 13:56.238
(Door slams)

13:56.272 --> 13:57.640
Yeah, I've got a problem.

13:57.674 --> 13:59.675
If this is about doors...

13:59.710 --> 14:01.376
Yeah, it's about doors,
yeah, my doors are gone,

14:01.411 --> 14:03.845
my front door, somebody stole my doors!

14:03.879 --> 14:05.780
Stevie: Yeah, you're gonna have
to talk to Roland about that.

14:05.815 --> 14:07.583
He lives just down the street,
you make a left out of the motel

14:07.617 --> 14:09.518
and then another left.

14:09.552 --> 14:11.487
It's a house with a truck in the driveway.

14:11.521 --> 14:16.158
There's a bumper sticker
of a naked Helen Mirren.

14:16.192 --> 14:20.895
(Moira screams) Oh my God, no! No! No!

14:20.930 --> 14:23.531
- Alexis: What?!
- Ah! My earrings! They were there.

14:23.565 --> 14:24.933
- They're not there!
- David: Where did they go?

14:24.967 --> 14:27.235
I don't know!

14:27.269 --> 14:29.137
I don't know! First you
threatened to abandon me,

14:29.171 --> 14:31.506
and now my precious diamonds are gone!

14:31.540 --> 14:33.775
Okay, you are super dramatic right now.

14:33.809 --> 14:36.810
Shut up and look for them! (Shrieks)

14:36.845 --> 14:39.079
(Whimpers, shrieks)

14:39.114 --> 14:40.515
(Screaming repeatedly)

14:40.549 --> 14:42.016
(Screams)

14:44.419 --> 14:45.986
(Sobbing hysterically)

14:46.021 --> 14:49.690
Get open!

14:49.724 --> 14:53.527
<i>(Dog barks)</i>

14:53.561 --> 14:56.496
<i>Johnny: Roland, I see you behind the truck!</i>

14:56.531 --> 14:58.498
Yeah, of course you see me.

14:58.533 --> 14:59.967
I'm looking at my gravel.

15:02.370 --> 15:04.872
Gravel these days, what are you gonna do?

15:04.906 --> 15:07.641
- Johnny: Yeah, it's gravel.
- Roland: Yeah, it's gravel!

15:07.675 --> 15:09.742
Hey, good news for you.

15:09.777 --> 15:12.145
I talked to a guy about
that bathroom window.

15:12.180 --> 15:14.514
That's the least of my concerns right now!

15:14.549 --> 15:17.717
Oh really? Well, why don't
we address your concerns?!

15:17.751 --> 15:21.020
The doors! I want my doors back!

15:21.055 --> 15:22.121
- Roland: Oh!
- Johnny: Before it gets dark!

15:22.156 --> 15:24.423
My son is afraid of moths.

15:24.457 --> 15:26.325
Oh, hmm. Well, here's the
thing about that Johnny,

15:26.359 --> 15:28.895
you see, you did a bad thing.

15:28.929 --> 15:31.263
You disrespected me in
front of your family!

15:31.298 --> 15:32.431
And now they think less of me.

15:32.465 --> 15:35.267
I doubt that's possible.

15:35.302 --> 15:37.170
And to be honest, you were
kinda breathing down our necks

15:37.204 --> 15:39.471
a little bit back at the motel.

15:39.506 --> 15:42.408
Johnny, when I was a kid
and I did a bad thing,

15:42.442 --> 15:45.077
my father took the doors off my room.

15:45.111 --> 15:49.147
And he said to me,
"Roland, privacy is earned."

15:49.182 --> 15:52.184
I am having a tough time following that.

15:52.219 --> 15:54.052
What the hell does that
have to do with privacy?

15:54.087 --> 15:57.422
Nothing. I just got mad,
and I took your doors.

15:57.456 --> 15:59.991
Look, if you took
offense to anything I said

16:00.026 --> 16:02.861
back at the motel, just
know it wasn't personal.

16:05.364 --> 16:08.366
All right, apology accepted.

16:08.400 --> 16:09.567
Well, that was less of an apology,

16:09.602 --> 16:11.069
and more of an explanation.

16:11.104 --> 16:12.070
Nevertheless, I accept your apology.

16:12.105 --> 16:14.171
Which it wasn't!

16:14.206 --> 16:16.941
So thank you again for that apology.

16:16.975 --> 16:18.576
Well, there was no apology,
and I can't do this anymore!

16:18.611 --> 16:20.578
You said you're sorry in a
very sweet and humble way,

16:20.613 --> 16:22.413
and that takes a big man to do that,

16:22.448 --> 16:25.316
and that's what Johnny
Rose is! A big man! Ooh!

16:29.855 --> 16:32.422
Moira: Oh! (Banging)

16:32.457 --> 16:35.726
Hello! Hello!

16:35.761 --> 16:38.428
Hi, hello, come here, please.

16:38.463 --> 16:43.067
I don't suppose you saw
any hobos or crackheads

16:43.101 --> 16:45.636
loitering around the hotel today?

16:45.670 --> 16:48.472
No crackheads, no...

16:48.506 --> 16:51.275
While the rooms were exposed to
the world like a Moroccan fair,

16:51.309 --> 16:54.378
someone got in here and stole my earrings.

16:54.412 --> 16:58.448
But it was just... but it
was just you here today.

16:58.483 --> 17:01.518
- Stevie: It was.
- Moira: It was.

17:01.552 --> 17:04.820
I'm assuming you were the only
one here on the premises today?

17:04.855 --> 17:07.356
I think I know where
you're going with this.

17:07.391 --> 17:11.761
No, I'm simply confirming
that you alone were here

17:11.796 --> 17:13.997
when the earrings were stolen.

17:14.031 --> 17:14.964
Are you asking me if I stole your earrings?

17:14.999 --> 17:18.067
No, I would never, please!

17:18.102 --> 17:21.170
But I also would certainly
never press charges

17:21.204 --> 17:24.039
if my earrings were
suddenly to be returned.

17:24.073 --> 17:27.075
If they suddenly reappeared,

17:27.109 --> 17:29.044
if you gave them back I
would not press charges,

17:29.078 --> 17:31.280
I would look the other way.

17:31.315 --> 17:33.081
Okay, you know what? I gotta run.

17:33.116 --> 17:35.284
'Cause I wanna hit the
pawn shop before it closes.

17:35.319 --> 17:37.452
I owe my crack dealer a ton of money, so.

17:37.486 --> 17:40.355
You seem like you have
this under control, though.

17:40.389 --> 17:42.024
David: What just happened?!

17:42.058 --> 17:44.526
Moira: David, I politely
asked that concierge girl

17:44.560 --> 17:47.229
if she had stolen my earrings,
and she turned ice cold,

17:47.263 --> 17:49.264
and now she's on her way to a pawn shop!

17:49.299 --> 17:51.700
David: What?! I need a towel!

17:51.734 --> 17:53.935
Hello, hi.

17:53.969 --> 17:56.304
Hi, I am sorry if my mom accused you

17:56.339 --> 17:58.440
- of taking something.
- Stevie: It's fine.

17:58.474 --> 18:00.442
Okay, but does this mean that
when you're cleaning our rooms,

18:00.476 --> 18:02.276
you're gonna put weird stuff in
our beds out of spite, or something?

18:02.311 --> 18:03.878
I won't be cleaning your room.

18:03.912 --> 18:05.447
Okay, can I ask you a question?

18:05.481 --> 18:07.549
Shoot.

18:07.583 --> 18:08.616
I think you're kind of rude!

18:08.651 --> 18:10.918
Is that a question?

18:10.953 --> 18:14.055
I have asked you thrice now for a towel,

18:14.089 --> 18:16.858
so that I may wash this town off my body.

18:16.892 --> 18:18.125
Do you think I wanna be here?

18:18.160 --> 18:19.861
Do you think I wanna be here?!

18:19.895 --> 18:21.562
I don't know what you want,

18:21.596 --> 18:23.664
you've given me one word
answers since I got here!

18:23.698 --> 18:25.599
So if I get you a towel you'll
stop following me to my car?

18:25.693 --> 18:29.596
Yes! Yes!

18:29.631 --> 18:32.232
Fine, but I'm only doing this
because you called me rude,

18:32.266 --> 18:34.435
and I take that as a compliment.

18:34.469 --> 18:36.603
The man is a lunatic!

18:36.638 --> 18:38.204
What the hell happened here?

18:38.239 --> 18:40.607
We've been robbed.

18:40.642 --> 18:43.910
Right now some local is
pawning my earrings for crank.

18:43.945 --> 18:45.711
- Johnny: Your diamonds?!
- Moira: Yes, my diamonds,

18:45.746 --> 18:47.680
the one thing I could hide under my tongue.

18:47.714 --> 18:52.185
Moira, I took your earrings out of here,

18:52.219 --> 18:56.022
and I put them in my shoe. For safekeeping.

18:56.057 --> 18:59.992
<i>Alexis: No! No! (Anguished sob)</i>

19:00.026 --> 19:02.728
Stavros just texted me.

19:02.763 --> 19:05.064
And he ended it, he's not coming!

19:05.098 --> 19:06.532
He said he doesn't have
time to come and get me,

19:06.567 --> 19:09.869
because he already rsvp'd
to Diddy's white party,

19:09.903 --> 19:12.338
and doesn't have time to do both!

19:12.372 --> 19:14.173
But I was supposed to be
his date to the white party!

19:14.207 --> 19:18.444
Alexis, he was never my favourite Stavros.

19:18.478 --> 19:20.079
I've hated that guy ever since he asked me

19:20.113 --> 19:22.348
to do lines with him at my sixtieth.

19:22.382 --> 19:24.749
Just out of sheer curiosity,

19:24.784 --> 19:27.586
um, where do you stand now

19:27.620 --> 19:29.521
on whether or not you
think this motel is cute?

19:29.555 --> 19:30.622
Like, is it still cute, or is it...

19:30.656 --> 19:32.657
You're a dick, David!

19:32.692 --> 19:34.459
David: Oh, I'm a dick!

19:34.494 --> 19:36.361
Okay, did I dump you for a party?!

19:36.395 --> 19:37.729
Johnny: David, help me with the doors.

19:37.763 --> 19:39.931
No I can't, I just got out of the shower.

19:39.966 --> 19:41.099
- I need help with the doors.
- David: Oh my God!

19:41.133 --> 19:42.801
Alexis: David, help him with the doors!

19:42.835 --> 19:44.503
- David: You help him with the doors!
- Alexis: No!

19:44.537 --> 19:45.637
David, could you help me with the doors?!

19:45.671 --> 19:47.205
It's air drying!

19:47.239 --> 19:49.807
Pick up a hammer, and
nail this coffin shut!

19:52.454 --> 19:54.100
As if I didn't see this coming.

19:54.858 --> 19:58.294
He's broken up with me five times already.

19:58.328 --> 20:01.730
Like, there was that time
that he never met me in Rio,

20:01.765 --> 20:03.231
<i>and remember that time that he gave me</i>

20:03.266 --> 20:06.135
his ex wife's engagement ring?

20:06.169 --> 20:08.537
And then, last summer,

20:08.571 --> 20:10.673
that time that he left his Molly

20:10.707 --> 20:12.440
<i>in my glove compartment,
and then I got arrested?</i>

20:12.475 --> 20:15.110
Oh my God! Can you do me a huge favour?

20:15.145 --> 20:17.845
And never repeat this to
anyone that you respect, okay?

20:17.880 --> 20:20.915
- David: Okay? Okay.
- Alexis: Okay.

20:20.949 --> 20:23.218
Kids, we just came in to say good night,

20:23.252 --> 20:26.954
and to remind you that we
will get through this...

20:26.989 --> 20:28.490
- David: Okay, good night!
- Johnny: As a family...

20:28.524 --> 20:30.925
David: Warmest regards to you both.

20:30.959 --> 20:34.996
And that will end up
on our feet in no time!

20:35.030 --> 20:36.931
Of course, by then our
feet will be shoeless,

20:36.965 --> 20:39.000
and filthy and mangled,

20:39.034 --> 20:42.737
from walking on cigarette
butts and broken beer bottles.

20:42.771 --> 20:46.507
So, seriously Alexis, enough about Stavros!

20:46.541 --> 20:50.578
I'm sorry if I am going
through something right now!

20:50.612 --> 20:51.845
David: You're going through something?!

20:53.000 --> 20:59.074
