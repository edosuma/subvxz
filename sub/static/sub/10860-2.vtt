01:59.600 --> 02:01.280
(SHRIEKS)

02:36.680 --> 02:38.840
It's an incredible feat of endurance.

02:39.880 --> 02:41.960
A whole year in the Cretaceous.

02:41.960 --> 02:44.240
I've been to
some pretty scary places.

02:44.240 --> 02:46.920
But...they don't even begin
to compare.

02:48.320 --> 02:51.280
It was hard.
We kept each other alive somehow.

02:52.280 --> 02:54.240
I promised...

02:54.240 --> 02:56.640
that I'd carry on
with Professor Cutter's work.

02:56.640 --> 02:59.600
Look, you're exhausted. Let
someone else carry the burden now.

02:59.600 --> 03:04.680
You don't understand.
This is my life. I can't just stop.

03:04.680 --> 03:07.960
Nobody else has seen the world
like that - in its purest form.

03:09.040 --> 03:11.400
I wish I -
Don't say it.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.400
Don't say you wish you'd been there.

03:16.160 --> 03:18.880
And now we're fired.
It's not like that.

03:18.880 --> 03:22.320
Then do something.
Get us back on the team.

03:22.320 --> 03:25.040
They're tired, upset.

03:25.040 --> 03:27.320
A few days,
they'll see things differently.

03:27.320 --> 03:30.640
You don't know them.
We agreed.

03:30.640 --> 03:32.680
Military are better equipped
to deal,

03:32.680 --> 03:34.960
emotionally, physically,
with the dangers.

03:34.960 --> 03:37.400
These are exceptional circumstances.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.240
Exceptional people.
The rules are made for a reason.

03:41.240 --> 03:44.240
I'm sorry. I have to deal with this.
Can we walk?

03:44.240 --> 03:46.840
Yes.

03:46.840 --> 03:49.200
We're on the brink
of great discoveries here.

03:49.200 --> 03:51.280
Not since man
first walked on the moon

03:51.280 --> 03:55.320
has humanity been so delicately
poised on the threshold
of a new dawn.

03:55.320 --> 03:57.320
Does dawn have a threshold exactly?

03:59.160 --> 04:02.520
My point is, this is not the time
to let the heart rule the head.

04:03.800 --> 04:05.840
But we need someone
to run the menagerie.

04:05.840 --> 04:08.400
Abby's the obvious choice.
It's not a field position.

04:08.400 --> 04:11.720
She has the qualifications.
Fine.

04:11.720 --> 04:15.200
And Connor? He has a brilliant mind.

04:15.200 --> 04:18.320
Undisciplined.
But we'll keep him under review.

04:21.600 --> 04:24.880
Sure all that stuff is in here?
It's what Jess said.

04:34.280 --> 04:36.400
Someone must've pulled them
from the old ark.

04:37.160 --> 04:39.400
And that would be me.

04:40.880 --> 04:43.040
So, you knew we'd be back one day.

04:43.040 --> 04:46.040
Well, I couldn't rule it out
as a possibility. And um...

04:46.040 --> 04:49.560
Lockers are expensive. Never knew
you were the sentimental type.

04:49.560 --> 04:51.720
Not at all.
I was just afraid of opening them.

04:51.720 --> 04:55.560
I have no desire whatsoever
to inspect Connor's collection
of girlie magazines

04:55.560 --> 04:57.560
and superhero action figures.

04:58.640 --> 05:03.120
Abby. We need someone to look after
the creatures in the menagerie.

05:04.280 --> 05:06.840
Job's yours, if you want it.
No.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.520
Thank you.

05:08.520 --> 05:11.080
Not without Connor.

05:11.080 --> 05:13.600
Hey. Oi. You take it.

05:13.600 --> 05:15.440
It's fine.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.800
Think of Rex.
He'll be an orphan if we both go.

05:19.360 --> 05:22.280
Anyway, one of us has got to
look for somewhere new to live.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.800
12 months backpay should help you
find somewhere decent.

05:26.760 --> 05:29.000
OK.
Good.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.440
I'm doing what I can for you,
but it's complicated.

05:31.440 --> 05:33.240
I need you to keep a low profile.

05:33.240 --> 05:35.520
Just for now.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.440
Oh, and Connor?

05:39.440 --> 05:42.280
Yo.
Please...stay out of trouble.

05:43.640 --> 05:45.600
Out of trouble.

05:47.200 --> 05:49.480
Check.

06:05.080 --> 06:07.040
Macca.

06:15.480 --> 06:17.520
Get rid of that junk.

06:17.520 --> 06:19.480
Pile it up and torch it.

06:35.320 --> 06:37.240
Just look at this for me.

07:02.120 --> 07:04.120
Hey!

07:06.640 --> 07:08.680
Use the computer at my place.

07:08.680 --> 07:12.040
It's warm and comfortable -
and feel free to raid the fridge.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.880
Come on. It's cheaper than
some internet cafe.

07:20.880 --> 07:24.240
You don't know me.
I've read the files. I know you.

07:26.960 --> 07:28.320
Thank you.

07:39.520 --> 07:41.400
This is your biotag ID.

07:41.400 --> 07:44.480
It contains all your physical data
and security clearance level.

07:44.480 --> 07:46.760
Impossible to fake or copy. Try it.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.400
OK.

07:57.960 --> 08:00.440
The menagerie's through here.

08:00.440 --> 08:02.800
Shall I give you the grand tour?

08:02.800 --> 08:05.320
I'd like to do this alone,
if that's OK. Sure.

08:37.400 --> 08:39.400
(ROARING)

08:40.440 --> 08:42.400
(GROWLING)

08:55.840 --> 08:57.760
(HIGH-PITCHED CHATTERING)

09:02.320 --> 09:04.400
Rex.

09:05.720 --> 09:07.760
Did you miss me?

09:11.240 --> 09:13.200
(EXCITED CHATTERING)

09:16.720 --> 09:18.840
How are you?

09:21.720 --> 09:24.040
Chin up.

09:34.040 --> 09:36.120
Connor's angry at being sidelined.

09:36.120 --> 09:38.680
He's impulsive.
Then he's still a risk.

09:39.760 --> 09:43.160
And Abby? My gut tells me
she won't be a problem.

09:43.160 --> 09:45.480
You have to treat them all
as equally dangerous.

09:45.480 --> 09:47.520
It could be any one of them.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.720
It could be all of them.

09:49.720 --> 09:51.760
Yeah, I know.

09:51.760 --> 09:53.720
I'm ready.

10:10.120 --> 10:12.080
(CLATTER)

10:18.520 --> 10:20.360
Boss?
(LOW ROAR)

10:24.480 --> 10:27.240
(GROWLING)

10:40.880 --> 10:43.480
(ROARING)

10:43.480 --> 10:45.520
(SCREAMS)

10:57.000 --> 10:58.960
Wow!

11:09.760 --> 11:11.800
Bit poky, Jess, but...

11:11.800 --> 11:14.480
I'm sure it'll do (!)

11:28.240 --> 11:31.360
Hey.
You all right?

11:31.360 --> 11:33.440
So, what do you think?

11:33.440 --> 11:36.080
It's not exactly
your average petting zoo, is it?

11:37.760 --> 11:39.800
I wish we could get them all home.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.880
They don't belong here.

11:41.880 --> 11:44.040
I agree.
Really?

11:44.040 --> 11:47.200
See, I thought the military approach
was to shoot first

11:47.200 --> 11:49.320
and worry about ethics later.

11:49.320 --> 11:53.440
I was in the army for a few years,
Abby. It doesn't make me
trigger-happy.

11:55.600 --> 11:57.560
Sorry.

11:58.680 --> 12:00.800
Becker says
you're brilliant with animals.

12:02.240 --> 12:04.240
As long as they're not
trying to eat me.

12:04.240 --> 12:06.880
Get on all right.

12:06.880 --> 12:09.960
Animals just do
what their instincts tell them.

12:09.960 --> 12:12.560
I like that.

12:12.560 --> 12:15.240
You think we should be more like
them? Follow our instincts?

12:16.560 --> 12:18.600
Wouldn't be such a bad idea.

12:18.600 --> 12:20.560
No.

12:53.280 --> 12:55.000
Duncan!

13:45.720 --> 13:49.480
Duncan. Good to see you, mate.
Show me some ID.

13:49.480 --> 13:52.280
This is my ID.

13:52.280 --> 13:54.360
I'm not listed anywhere.

13:54.360 --> 13:58.200
How did you find me?
I called your mum.

14:00.280 --> 14:04.240
Come on, mate. It's me. Let me in.

14:04.240 --> 14:06.360
Please?

14:22.160 --> 14:24.120
Nice place.

14:25.160 --> 14:27.200
It's erm...

14:27.200 --> 14:29.280
It's a little bit...smelly.

14:29.280 --> 14:31.680
How long have you been here?
You never called me.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.680
'Ey, look. I've...

14:35.680 --> 14:37.720
been away.

14:37.720 --> 14:39.680
So, why are you here now?

14:40.760 --> 14:43.080
Trying to catch up with old mates.
Yeah. Right.

14:43.080 --> 14:45.160
Don't forget, Connor.

14:45.160 --> 14:48.840
I was there when Tom died.
I heard what you said.

14:48.840 --> 14:52.160
'It was a conspiracy,
all the way to the top,' you said.

14:53.560 --> 14:57.160
'Mind control,' you said.
I miss Tom too, mate.

14:57.160 --> 14:59.760
But there's no mind control.

14:59.760 --> 15:02.840
I was just saying what Tom
wanted to hear. Where is it?

15:08.080 --> 15:10.800
What are you doing?
Ah. Yeah.

15:10.800 --> 15:13.200
Right. Now, you'll know...
what this is.

15:14.280 --> 15:16.600
Oh, Duncan!
No, it's not mine!

15:16.600 --> 15:19.440
It's creature faeces. Dinosaur poo.

15:20.560 --> 15:23.080
Those dodos weren't
the only creatures, were they?

15:24.240 --> 15:26.280
No-one believed me.

15:26.280 --> 15:28.560
The doctor said I was sick.

15:28.560 --> 15:30.520
Having delusions.

15:32.720 --> 15:34.760
So.

15:34.760 --> 15:36.560
I found some proof!

15:37.840 --> 15:39.800
For myself.

15:43.560 --> 15:45.800
Come on. I'll show you.

15:45.800 --> 15:47.760
It's not far away.

15:47.760 --> 15:50.800
Take that.

15:50.800 --> 15:53.560
Mobile phones -
they're...too easy to trace.

15:53.560 --> 15:56.040
Duncan. Duncan!

15:57.080 --> 15:59.080
What happened to you?

15:59.080 --> 16:01.120
You did, Connor.

16:01.120 --> 16:03.560
You...happened to me.

16:07.040 --> 16:09.000
Oh, come on. Let's go.

16:15.680 --> 16:18.280
'It's through the door behind you!'

16:18.280 --> 16:20.240
'(SIGHS)'

16:27.000 --> 16:30.080
The builders are never here
at lunchtime, so we should be safe.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.440
This used to be a proper community.

16:33.440 --> 16:35.720
30, 40 homeless people?

16:35.720 --> 16:38.120
Yeah. I lived here for a while.

16:38.120 --> 16:40.240
Well, I couldn't go back
to the old flat.

16:41.320 --> 16:43.480
It was after I left
the killing started.

16:43.480 --> 16:45.840
People disappearing.
Duncan.

16:47.120 --> 16:49.520
They probably just left,
cos of the building work.

16:49.520 --> 16:52.040
No. Bodies started turning up.
Ripped to pieces.

16:54.960 --> 16:56.720
Why did no-one do anything, then?

16:57.800 --> 16:59.840
These are homeless people, Connor.

16:59.840 --> 17:02.680
No relatives,
no-one to look out for them.

17:02.680 --> 17:05.480
The authorities don't care.
Listen.

17:05.480 --> 17:08.040
If there was a creature,
we'd already know about it.

17:08.040 --> 17:10.040
How?

17:10.040 --> 17:12.079
We just would.

17:13.520 --> 17:15.839
Trust me.

17:17.599 --> 17:19.560
Whoa!

17:20.800 --> 17:23.599
Stay there.

17:23.599 --> 17:26.400
Give me that.
What is it?

17:43.400 --> 17:46.000
What is it?! OK.
I need you to go straight home now.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.160
I'll catch up with you later. OK?

17:48.160 --> 17:50.120
It's a creature, isn't it?
I was right!

17:50.120 --> 17:53.720
Duncan. It's happening again.
The world's gotta know!

17:56.200 --> 17:58.000
Seen it?
Yeah.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.640
Good. We're going!

18:00.640 --> 18:03.640
Abby needs to see this.
The hot blonde? Yep.

18:06.080 --> 18:08.040
Find anything yet?

18:08.040 --> 18:10.440
Kind of. Erm...I need you to

18:10.440 --> 18:12.400
see something.
You've found a flat?

18:12.400 --> 18:14.960
No. Have any anomalies
been detected today?

18:18.480 --> 18:21.440
No. Connor?

18:21.440 --> 18:23.680
What's going on?
I need you to come down here.

18:23.680 --> 18:25.720
Down where?
The docks.

18:25.720 --> 18:28.640
The old warehouse by
the power station in Fortune Road.

18:30.560 --> 18:32.520
Just give me a second.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.720
Sorry. Haven't set you up
with your password yet.

18:37.720 --> 18:38.920
Hello?

18:38.920 --> 18:41.760
It's just, if someone unauthorised
is found on the system,

18:41.760 --> 18:44.400
the whole thing shuts down -
alarms, panics,

18:44.400 --> 18:47.600
screaming, the whole
security nine yards. Nightmare.

18:57.960 --> 19:01.520
It's got it. I'm on my way.

19:08.920 --> 19:11.960
Duncan, don't cry, mate.
It's not helping.

19:20.600 --> 19:23.160
Anything I can help you with?

19:24.440 --> 19:26.520
Just gonna pop out for a bit.

19:26.520 --> 19:30.800
What if there's an anomaly?
Got my black box.

19:30.800 --> 19:32.920
Turned on?
Always.

19:32.920 --> 19:38.040
Bring me back some chocolate.
Nothing with orange in it, though.
That's just weird.

19:42.360 --> 19:44.920
Matt's acting strange.
Really? In what way?

19:44.920 --> 19:48.080
I've worked with him eight months,
and I've read his file backwards.

19:48.080 --> 19:50.920
But I still don't feel I know him.
You read his file?

19:50.920 --> 19:53.040
Yeah. I read everyone's file.
That's my job.

19:54.480 --> 19:56.560
Not that I've...read your file.

19:56.560 --> 19:58.640
The personal bits, I mean.

19:58.640 --> 20:00.960
Nothing about wives or girlfriends
or boyfriends.

20:00.960 --> 20:02.920
Anything like that.

20:04.920 --> 20:07.560
And if you did have
one of those things,

20:07.560 --> 20:09.920
it would probably be a girlfriend,
would it?

20:09.920 --> 20:12.200
Rather than the other options,
I mean.

20:14.160 --> 20:16.880
Anyway. About Matt...

20:16.880 --> 20:18.960
Leave it, Jessica.
He knows what he's doing.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.800
What are you up to?

20:37.800 --> 20:39.720
Hey.
Hi.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.960
You remember Duncan, don't you?

20:45.480 --> 20:48.440
Sure.
Are you like his girlfriend now?

20:48.440 --> 20:51.440
Yeah.
This way.

20:51.440 --> 20:54.240
Wow. There's hope for us all.

20:54.240 --> 20:56.200
It's just down here.

21:00.040 --> 21:02.680
That's weird.

21:02.680 --> 21:04.760
It's gone.

21:04.760 --> 21:07.680
The body's gone. The creature
must've come back for it.

21:07.680 --> 21:10.400
What made you think
it was a creature kill? Er...

21:10.400 --> 21:12.760
Lateral incisions,
the throat had been torn out.

21:12.760 --> 21:15.160
There was a big chunk
gnawed out of his side.

21:15.160 --> 21:17.080
His left leg was hanging by a thread.

21:17.080 --> 21:19.360
So, not natural causes, then.
Not so much, no.

21:28.160 --> 21:30.680
Matt's heading to the docks.
So what?

21:30.680 --> 21:33.280
Well, why is he doing that?
I dunno, Jess.

21:33.280 --> 21:35.240
Perhaps he's buying a boat (!)

21:41.280 --> 21:44.040
(MEN'S VOICES)
Connor. Connor!

21:44.040 --> 21:46.040
Get rid of them!

How am I supposed to...

21:49.440 --> 21:52.040
Health and Safety Board, mate.

21:52.040 --> 21:55.760
There's structural damage in here.
You're gonna have to get
your men out now.

21:56.760 --> 21:59.040
You're not Health and Safety.

21:59.040 --> 22:02.000
Trust me. It's not safe
for you to stay here.

22:02.000 --> 22:06.400
Blondie? Go home! And take your
er...boyfriends with you.

22:08.080 --> 22:10.640
Dunno where Macca's taken off to.
I want this lot torched.

22:19.560 --> 22:22.240
Seriously. You don't wanna do that.

23:33.060 --> 23:36.020
The nest isn't there.

23:36.020 --> 23:39.140
There's no sign of it.
It could be anywhere.

23:39.140 --> 23:40.980
Early cretaceous, right?

23:40.980 --> 23:43.420
Caprisucus. It's a bar croc.

23:43.420 --> 23:45.220
There were no tusks.
It's full grown.

23:45.220 --> 23:48.340
Nearly right, though.
Better check outside.

23:50.980 --> 23:53.900
Connor, come with me. Abby,
take the perimeter, head north.

23:53.900 --> 23:55.820
We'll meet you at the other side.
OK.

24:07.260 --> 24:10.140
Matt. Please respond.

24:10.140 --> 24:11.820
He's definitely up to something.

24:13.740 --> 24:16.100
Abby was on there
looking at maps of the docks.

24:16.100 --> 24:18.020
Then Matt used the terminal
and left.

24:18.020 --> 24:22.060
And check this out. He's at the
docks, but his phone's turned off.

24:22.060 --> 24:24.780
Look at that erratic pattern
of movement.

24:24.780 --> 24:27.420
Nothing's showing. No anomalies.

24:27.420 --> 24:30.180
He's chasing something.
Yeah. Or being chased.

24:30.180 --> 24:33.300
I'm gonna get a team together.
You keep trying him.

24:33.300 --> 24:36.740
Here.
You're gonna need one of these.

24:40.180 --> 24:43.500
Jess, we've got an incursion,
but no weapons. What's going on?

24:43.500 --> 24:45.420
I need Becker down here now.
He's on his way.

24:47.580 --> 24:50.900
Sorry. That's quite cool.

24:55.700 --> 24:57.740
Yes. OK.

24:57.740 --> 24:59.660
You're...brilliant.

25:02.020 --> 25:04.700
All units, listen up.

25:04.700 --> 25:07.220
We've got a creature report
at these co-ordinates.

25:07.220 --> 25:10.780
I've ordered the harbourmaster
to shut the port to all shipping

25:10.780 --> 25:13.300
and have the coastguard
establish an exclusion zone

25:13.300 --> 25:15.580
one nautical mile out.
Good thinking.

25:15.580 --> 25:17.700
Becker's on his way.

25:24.540 --> 25:26.500
(SPLASH)

25:33.820 --> 25:36.100
It's here in the water.
Can we track it by road?

25:38.220 --> 25:40.100
No. It's heading out
into the harbour.

25:42.180 --> 25:45.700
I'm on it.
On it? What does she mean, on it?

25:51.300 --> 25:53.780
'I have him.
Try to plot my position.'

25:53.780 --> 25:56.060
Abby, turn back.
'What, and lose it again?'

26:04.420 --> 26:06.660
Ease up.

26:06.660 --> 26:09.340
Abby, what's happening?

26:13.740 --> 26:15.820
You OK?

26:24.980 --> 26:27.820
The cargo ship. It's heading for
the container port.

26:29.940 --> 26:32.580
Go!

26:54.300 --> 26:56.580
Duncan. I think it's better
if you stay here.

26:56.580 --> 26:59.260
Don't worry. I'm not going anywhere.

I'm on board.

27:26.100 --> 27:29.020
Get to the bridge.
Have the rest of the ship evacuated.

27:31.380 --> 27:34.580
Hi. You need to abandon ship.
There is a dangerous animal on board.

27:34.580 --> 27:36.300
And you are...?
Look.

27:54.300 --> 27:56.420
Think it went overboard?
We'd have heard it.

27:56.420 --> 27:58.300
I'm heading into the hold.

27:58.300 --> 28:01.580
I'll double-check this level, report
back. I thought you were fired.

We're taking it ashore.

29:30.440 --> 29:32.400
He's an old friend.

That was my gang.

29:34.080 --> 29:36.320
Friends. Whatever.

ever got over it.

call it in as soon as you knew?

So, we're gonna use the flares.

Yeah.
Yes. Erm...

I know he's definitely
in a green container.

36:43.160 --> 36:45.680
Hey.
Thank you.

36:47.800 --> 36:50.520
The caprisucus anomaly
must've closed a long time ago.

We don't have anomaly data from that
era. Pity. Might've been useful.

Never mind. Crisis averted.
Well done, Matt.

36:57.320 --> 36:59.400
It wasn't down to me.

36:59.400 --> 37:02.960
If it wasn't for Abby and Connor,
our creature would still be at large.

37:02.960 --> 37:06.480
I thought they were supposed to be
out of the front line. Oh, they are.

37:06.480 --> 37:09.440
They just don't seem to know it.
We can't have rogue operators.

37:09.440 --> 37:13.320
Then you'll have to lock them up.
It's the only way you'll stop them.

37:13.320 --> 37:16.960
Look. Their experience is too
valuable to be wasted behind a desk.

37:16.960 --> 37:20.440
I'd really like to have them
both back on full operational duty.

37:20.440 --> 37:23.000
I thought I made it
very clear to you - Er, Philip.

37:23.000 --> 37:26.280
I suppose, given that Abby and Connor
were formerly employed

37:26.280 --> 37:29.120
before the military rule
came into force, technically,

37:29.120 --> 37:31.080
they aren't covered by it.

37:32.280 --> 37:35.520
So, they're back in.
Legally, they were never out.

37:39.280 --> 37:43.080
I take it you have no objection.
No. It's entirely up to you.
I wouldn't interfere.

37:47.960 --> 37:49.920
Thanks, Philip.

37:54.800 --> 37:57.360
You all right?

38:00.160 --> 38:02.520
Hey. Tom would've been
proud of you today.

38:04.040 --> 38:06.080
I ran away, Connor.

I'm not exactly Indiana Jones.

38:08.120 --> 38:09.880
What? Look at you.

You're a hero.
And I'll tell you for why.

38:16.440 --> 38:18.840
No-one else cared
to investigate those deaths.

38:18.840 --> 38:21.240
Without you, that croc'd still be
killing people.

38:21.240 --> 38:22.400
Yeah.

38:26.240 --> 38:28.280
You all right?
Yeah.

38:28.280 --> 38:31.560
Oh, and Duncan. If you do
come across anything online...

38:31.560 --> 38:34.160
call me.
Seriously?

38:34.160 --> 38:36.400
You want me to help out?

38:36.400 --> 38:40.200
You've got my number. Do I get
a special badge, or something?

38:40.200 --> 38:42.080
No.

38:43.240 --> 38:45.640
I'll see what I can do.

38:47.720 --> 38:50.120
You know there's no conspiracy,
right? Yeah.

38:50.120 --> 38:52.080
See you.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.560
See you later, mate.

39:06.960 --> 39:09.320
Hey, Connor!
Yo.

39:09.320 --> 39:11.120
You and the hot blonde.

39:12.360 --> 39:14.920
Unbelievable.

39:14.920 --> 39:16.120
Yep.

39:18.040 --> 39:20.000
Unbelievable.

39:35.200 --> 39:37.080
By the way. Where's my chocolate?

39:37.080 --> 39:39.480
I was kind of busy (!)

39:46.520 --> 39:50.000
Thank you.
Nothing with orange in it, right?

39:50.000 --> 39:52.640
Right.

39:54.600 --> 39:57.440
You look a little flushed.
It's just the chocolate.

39:57.440 --> 39:59.720
Gets me all excited.

40:01.240 --> 40:03.680
Look, guys. I was thinking.

40:03.680 --> 40:06.520
My place has got
plenty of spare room.

40:06.520 --> 40:09.760
Why don't you two move in for a bit?
Give you a chance to find somewhere.

40:10.680 --> 40:14.000
I suppose this is what you think of
as not getting into any trouble!

40:17.680 --> 40:21.320
Listen. Lester,
you need to know something.

40:21.320 --> 40:24.520
You can sack me, but you can't
stop me doing this work.

40:24.520 --> 40:26.760
Threaten me, disown me.

40:26.760 --> 40:28.840
Banish me. Whatever.

40:28.840 --> 40:32.080
But if I think there's a creature
loose, I'm gonna investigate it. OK?

40:39.120 --> 40:41.160
Well...

40:41.160 --> 40:43.200
since you put it like that...

40:43.200 --> 40:45.040
you're back on the team.

40:47.520 --> 40:49.720
Blimey. I should get angry
more often.

40:49.720 --> 40:52.160
And I want a pay rise!

40:56.040 --> 40:58.000
Don't push your luck.

41:07.960 --> 41:09.920
Oh, yeah.

41:14.200 --> 41:16.160
Make yourselves at home.

41:20.560 --> 41:24.000
Nice pad. I'll order in
some Chinese. I wanna hear

41:24.000 --> 41:27.520
all about Lester and Becker
and Danny Quinn,
Professor Cutter and Becker.

41:28.640 --> 41:30.280
Did I mention him already?

41:32.240 --> 41:34.160
The files only tell you so much,
you know.

41:35.120 --> 41:37.080
Abby.

41:42.040 --> 41:44.840
New roomies. Brilliant!

41:51.800 --> 41:54.280
Where are you from?
When are you from?

41:55.360 --> 41:57.760
I have to find the man
who came through with me.

41:57.760 --> 42:01.240
She clearly isn't from our time.
She could be infectious, hostile,
psychotic.

42:02.440 --> 42:05.120
Connor. I need your help.

42:05.120 --> 42:07.760
We must go back before it's too late.

42:07.760 --> 42:09.600
Wait!

42:09.600 --> 42:13.240
I know it's not as thrilling
as running after an overgrown lizard.

42:14.440 --> 42:16.680
But one day, this will save lives.

42:19.960 --> 42:22.320
He'd never go through.
He knows the rules.

42:22.320 --> 42:25.200
No expeditions, no search parties,
no rescue.

42:25.200 --> 42:27.280
This...stays locked!

42:27.280 --> 42:30.760
Besides, if he's been
dragged through by a creature,
he's already dead.
