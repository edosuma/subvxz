WEBVTT

00:06.340 --> 00:09.958
...And I had on this ugly taffeta dress.

00:10.052 --> 00:13.715
Oh, what colour?
Please say sea breeze.

00:13.806 --> 00:15.467
Sea breeze.

00:15.558 --> 00:19.176
And my hair was three feet high.
I lay it out on the kitchen table.

00:19.270 --> 00:23.388
| iron it flat and then, I hairspray
it and my date does not show.

00:23.482 --> 00:25.143
--Oh, no.
--Tota||y bailed.

00:25.234 --> 00:27.395
So, I go to the prom, alone,

00:27.486 --> 00:32.651
and Andrewjust shows up an hour later
and he tosses a wrist corsage at me.

00:32.742 --> 00:36.735
And says, "My mom got this for you."

00:36.829 --> 00:40.538
And then he got drunk in the
parking lot with his buddies all night.

00:40.625 --> 00:42.115
That is so romantic.

00:42.210 --> 00:45.668
But I can't say I blame him, 'cause
your hair did sound pretty brutal.

00:48.049 --> 00:50.085
--Can I be excused? Thanks.
--I can't believe you said that.

00:50.176 --> 00:51.757
That almost went down my top.

01:02.688 --> 01:06.351
Hey! Someone's going to
have to clean that up.

01:13.032 --> 01:17.366
Sonny, you better have
a damn good reason

01:17.453 --> 01:22.823
why you're painting
my friend on this wall.

01:32.260 --> 01:35.172
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

01:35.263 --> 01:38.175
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

01:38.266 --> 01:41.178
My love carries a death sentence.

01:41.269 --> 01:43.351
l was lost for years,

01:43.437 --> 01:46.099
searching, while hiding,

01:46.190 --> 01:50.354
only to find that I belong to
a world hidden from humans.

01:50.444 --> 01:55.313
I won't hide anymore.
I will live the life I choose.

02:03.374 --> 02:06.207
--Sorry.
--That's okay.

02:06.294 --> 02:08.580
You want to stretch out?

02:15.136 --> 02:18.003
--[LAUREN] Thanks.
--[BO] It's like couch yoga-

02:19.890 --> 02:23.098
Hey, succu-face!? Can I see you
for a minute in the kitchen?

02:23.185 --> 02:25.176
I think I seen a rat.

02:29.775 --> 02:31.515
Hey. You guys having fun?

02:31.610 --> 02:34.693
Kenzi, I know what you're thinking,
but this is purely platonic.

02:34.780 --> 02:37.897
Earth to Bo. I do not
care if it's platonic.

02:37.992 --> 02:39.948
I don't even care if it's slutonic.

02:40.036 --> 02:43.073
We are harbouring a
fugitive from the Ash!

02:46.792 --> 02:48.953
--I know that.
--Okay, so what are you
going to do about it?

02:49.045 --> 02:52.913
Something clever that I
haven't quite figured out yet.

02:53.007 --> 02:56.044
Look, | get it, okay. You
love having Lauren around.

02:56.135 --> 02:59.172
But I just hope that whatever it is
you're feeling is not going to stop you

02:59.263 --> 03:01.379
from dealing with this little
situation that we're in.

03:01.474 --> 03:03.430
You know, I liked it better
when l was the mom.

03:03.517 --> 03:06.179
Honey, you were never the mom.

03:10.399 --> 03:11.809
Reschedule that meeting
at William Morris.

03:11.901 --> 03:13.766
And I need a dress for that award show.

03:13.861 --> 03:19.322
There she is! The most beautiful
creature God's poet ever penned

03:19.408 --> 03:22.650
and her boss, the Morrigan.

03:22.745 --> 03:28.490
Bianca, did we have a meeting
with Vex scheduled today?

03:28.584 --> 03:33.374
Sorry. Thought I'd pop in
for a bit of téte-a-tete.

03:33.464 --> 03:34.795
What's on your mind?

03:34.882 --> 03:37.544
Bit of a pickle. I don't suppose
you would know why one of your

03:37.635 --> 03:41.469
human artists would paint a rather
naughty picture of me killing a Vampire

03:41.555 --> 03:43.341
we both knew and despised?

03:43.432 --> 03:47.846
A Vampire | dispatched at
your behest, may I add.

03:47.937 --> 03:52.306
Right piece of nasty business that is.
Short of steel and silver to the face.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.436
Scorpion Man was around
since the Babylonian Empire

03:54.527 --> 03:58.236
and not to mention,
a personal friend of mine.

03:58.322 --> 04:04.443
I don't suppose Jason is here right
now. Jason? Oh, Jason, lovey?

04:04.537 --> 04:07.153
Vex!

04:07.248 --> 04:09.364
It's just a painting, darling.

04:09.458 --> 04:13.497
May I remind you l have a
human reputation to uphold.

04:13.587 --> 04:16.670
I own several clubs,
I need liquor licences.

04:16.757 --> 04:19.464
l have a city council to keep happy.

04:19.552 --> 04:23.511
Funny, isn't it? Jason gets hold
of top secret information

04:23.597 --> 04:26.339
and paints it for all the world to see.

04:26.434 --> 04:32.680
I don't suppose you let something slip
while he was slipping you something?

04:32.773 --> 04:36.607
Vex, Vex, Vex.

04:36.694 --> 04:41.984
If you forget your place, you could lose
a lot more than your liquor license.

04:42.074 --> 04:44.406
I would never.

04:44.493 --> 04:51.160
If there is a leak, I will find it and
Jason will get what he deserves.

04:51.250 --> 04:55.459
When you do find Jason,
if it pleases you,

04:55.546 --> 04:58.208
I would like to conduct
the interrogation.

04:58.299 --> 05:01.962
And I would like a
dragon to heat my pool.

05:10.269 --> 05:13.932
How could Jason do this to me?

05:14.023 --> 05:17.607
That mess is not going
to clean itself up!

05:25.493 --> 05:30.408
Bianca, do you think that Vex is
entirely happy with his station?

05:32.750 --> 05:35.036
Well, he could move up in
the world if you were deposed.

05:35.127 --> 05:37.368
He might even try for your position.

05:40.174 --> 05:43.758
Get your coat. I need
you to fetch something.

05:43.844 --> 05:49.214
They have managed to survive for
over two hundred million years.

05:51.644 --> 05:55.887
[knocking]

05:55.981 --> 05:58.017
Hi. Are you Bo?

05:58.108 --> 05:59.518
--That depends.
--My employer would like to know

05:59.610 --> 06:00.975
if you're free to take a meeting.

06:01.070 --> 06:02.276
Who's your employer?

06:02.363 --> 06:06.652
Sweetie, your career had a serious
case of ED. before I took you on.

06:06.742 --> 06:10.655
So, I say it's time you
showed me a little love.

06:10.746 --> 06:15.240
There's no way I'm signing
away my royalties to you.

06:17.795 --> 06:22.129
Hey. You should really
reconsider this new contract.

06:22.216 --> 06:24.423
It's all ou've ever wanted.
Y

06:27.388 --> 06:29.629
Maybe I'll reconsider.

06:31.600 --> 06:35.889
I mean, it's all I ever wanted.

06:35.980 --> 06:39.848
I am so delighted you think so.

06:39.942 --> 06:41.398
Kisses.

06:47.908 --> 06:53.244
Bianca, I hope you're not
smiling at your incompetence.

06:53.330 --> 06:58.040
You had me double-booked tomorrow.
I had to shuffle my own appointments.

06:58.127 --> 06:59.833
I'm so sorry.

07:02.840 --> 07:06.207
Wow! And to think if I had
aligned myself with the Dark Fae,

07:06.302 --> 07:07.758
you could treat me like that, too.

07:07.845 --> 07:11.258
Don't worry about her.
She's irreplaceable.

07:11.348 --> 07:12.633
Having a Seniatta around

07:12.725 --> 07:16.138
when negotiating my artists'
principles is a must.

07:16.228 --> 07:18.435
Besides, if I don't bust her chops
once in a while, she gets lazy.

07:18.522 --> 07:20.808
--A Seniatta?
--An Italian Fae.

07:20.899 --> 07:23.891
She can control a human's
inner motivations.

07:23.986 --> 07:27.023
I'll give you one as a signing
bonus if you join the Dark side.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.321
You know, I really hope that's
not why you brought me here.

07:29.408 --> 07:36.826
No. And boring. One of my rising stars
is Jason Baines. The human painter.

07:36.915 --> 07:40.783
He's gone and killed a Dark Fae
Elder and painted some sensitive

07:40.878 --> 07:43.494
Fae information in public.

07:43.589 --> 07:46.706
I need you to figure out
what's going on, quickly.

07:46.800 --> 07:47.789
Why me?

07:47.885 --> 07:52.470
Well, there seems to be a leak in my
camp. Not entirely sure who I can trust.

07:52.556 --> 07:57.300
Since you're alone, you're all l have.

07:57.394 --> 08:00.727
So, find the boy and bring him to me.

08:00.814 --> 08:04.682
I am not in the habit of rounding up
humans so they can be murdered.

08:04.777 --> 08:09.771
That's just the thing, isn't it?
I don't want Jason killed.

08:09.865 --> 08:13.028
And why should I believe you?

08:13.118 --> 08:17.077
I could never see
Jason killed because...

08:21.335 --> 08:24.919
...I seem to have fallen
in love with him.

08:38.686 --> 08:39.892
I'd say don't take the job

08:39.978 --> 08:43.015
if I thought that you had any
intention of taking my advice.

08:43.107 --> 08:45.098
--But since you don't--
--Thank you.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.433
There's a few things you should know
about your tender-hearted friend,

08:47.528 --> 08:49.894
the Morrigan. She's a Leanan Sidhe.

08:49.988 --> 08:52.195
--The country singer?
--A Fae seductress.

08:52.282 --> 08:55.649
She inspires artists and makes them
great and feeds off their genius.

08:55.744 --> 08:57.280
An evil muse, if you will.

08:57.371 --> 08:59.327
Convenient skill for an agent.

08:59.415 --> 09:02.532
But she eventually drives the
artist mad and into an early grave.

09:02.626 --> 09:04.708
Any self-destructive rock
stars we know and love

09:04.795 --> 09:08.379
happen to have dated one
of these Leanan Sidhes?

09:08.465 --> 09:10.126
No comment.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.832
Thanks, Trick.

09:11.927 --> 09:14.714
Bo, this boy Jason
has killed a Dark Fae.

09:14.805 --> 09:16.966
He might be suffering
a complete breakdown,

09:17.057 --> 09:20.094
which makes him totally unpredictable.

09:22.354 --> 09:24.970
Well, this must be
where the painting was.

09:25.065 --> 09:30.935
Ha! Way to cover the evidence.
No one in the Fae world watches C.S.|.?

09:31.029 --> 09:33.156
I like Jason's tag, though.
His lines are awesome.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.822
Oh, is little Miss Ragamuffin
also a patron of the arts?

09:35.909 --> 09:37.615
Hey, you live on the
street as long as I did,

09:37.703 --> 09:41.321
you meet a lot of riff-raff and
they all think they're artists.

09:41.415 --> 09:43.121
| wish I knew who these
other tags belonged to.

09:43.208 --> 09:45.290
Maybe someone knows
where Jason is.

09:45.377 --> 09:47.538
Oh, balls.

09:47.629 --> 09:49.005
What?

09:49.089 --> 09:51.580
| sort of know the massive
a-hole who painted this one.

09:51.675 --> 09:53.381
Well, do you know
where we can find him?

09:53.469 --> 09:56.427
Yes. Follow me.

10:06.315 --> 10:10.274
Ah, there he is. Yo, yo, Tryst.

10:10.360 --> 10:14.194
Oh, oh, girlie. I knew you'd come
crawling back to me. One sec.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.522
--You dated that tool?
--No.

10:16.617 --> 10:20.030
He bought me a hotdog once.
And he ate most of it.

10:20.120 --> 10:24.534
So, you come back to make things right?
'Cause I started seeing this girl.

10:24.625 --> 10:28.413
No, you didn't. We are
looking for this guy.

10:28.504 --> 10:30.290
You know him?

10:30.380 --> 10:33.087
Know him? We was like brothers.
I used to spot for him.

10:33.175 --> 10:34.540
Most street artists have a spotter

10:34.635 --> 10:37.422
in case the cops show up
and you gotta book.

10:37.513 --> 10:39.128
Have you seen him lately?

10:39.223 --> 10:45.059
No. Jason made it to the bigs. Signed
with some hot-as-balls agent lady.

10:45.145 --> 10:48.478
Booked him some real legit shows.
Jay was making mad dollar bills.

10:48.565 --> 10:51.147
Oh, yeah? He wised up and
dumped your ass, huh?

10:51.235 --> 10:55.148
Nah. Me and Jay was tight. He just
started acting crazy all of a sudden.

10:55.239 --> 10:56.945
Started doing stuff I never seen before.

10:57.032 --> 10:59.774
--Like what?
--One time, he painted this pig

10:59.868 --> 11:02.484
in a cop's uniform on the
side of the paddy wagon

11:02.579 --> 11:04.194
while Five-O was still inside, yo.

11:04.289 --> 11:07.452
--Drugs?
--No. Jason never even drank.

11:07.543 --> 11:10.410
It makes me sad.
When he first hit the street,

11:10.504 --> 11:13.792
l was his artful dodger, always
keeping him out of trouble.

11:13.882 --> 11:16.214
You never read Oliver Twist, did you?

11:16.301 --> 11:18.417
Maybe. What kind of stuff did he write?

11:18.512 --> 11:20.673
--Thanks, genius.
--Thank you.

11:20.764 --> 11:23.255
Hey, Kenzi! When are you
going to let me paint you, girl?

11:23.350 --> 11:26.717
You know, Titanic style,
all tasteful-like.

11:26.812 --> 11:32.933
Hey, tattooed your digits
over my heart. Over my heart.

11:33.026 --> 11:36.234
Trickster? Tell me you've
got some magical booze

11:36.321 --> 11:38.812
that can erase the last fifteen
minutes of my life, please.

11:38.907 --> 11:40.898
--Yup. Tequila.
--Great.

11:40.993 --> 11:44.076
So, Jason is slowly going
crazy, thanks to the Morrigan.

11:44.162 --> 11:45.072
Somehow, he slipped away

11:45.163 --> 11:48.326
and now he's painting Fae
secrets all over town, but why?

11:48.417 --> 11:52.205
Maybe he wised up. His paintings
could be a warning to other artists.

11:52.296 --> 11:54.036
To not get involved with the Dark Fae?

11:54.131 --> 11:57.919
That's a pretty lucid plan for a nut job.
Something just doesn't add up.

11:58.010 --> 11:58.965
[cell phone ringing]

11:59.052 --> 12:05.639
Oh, god. He did it. He totally
tattooed my digits over his heart.

12:05.726 --> 12:08.559
--Hello?
--[TRYST] Hey, I ran into my boy, Jason.

12:08.645 --> 12:09.896
Where? Where? Is he with you now?

12:09.980 --> 12:12.767
No, I tried to say hello.
You know, reminisce?

12:12.858 --> 12:16.066
But he felt like hitting me in the face
with the butt end of a shot gun instead.

12:16.153 --> 12:17.188
Well, where did he go?

12:17.279 --> 12:20.442
[TRYST] Heading towards the West End.
Used to paint there back in the day.

12:20.532 --> 12:23.524
An alleyway behind that
fancy people's hotel

12:23.619 --> 12:26.156
where they sell oxygen
tanks in the mini bar.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.281
Great. Thank you.

12:27.372 --> 12:28.953
[TRYST] Put Kenzi on the phone.

12:29.041 --> 12:30.406
I broke my nose helping all y'all.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.877
I could use a sexy nurse.
You know what |--

12:32.961 --> 12:34.246
Hello?

12:34.338 --> 12:35.794
Come on.

12:37.633 --> 12:39.589
You, the man.

12:40.928 --> 12:44.512
Man, if I step in one more
pile of rancid filth...

12:44.598 --> 12:48.056
Why can't street artists
paint in a park or at a spa?

12:48.143 --> 12:49.758
Is it time for your nap, my darling?

12:49.853 --> 12:52.310
This is the third alley we've been
in and l was really hoping

12:52.397 --> 12:54.683
that we would have found Jason by
now so that I can go home and--

12:54.775 --> 12:57.517
And be platonic with Lauren, right?

12:57.611 --> 13:00.068
Okay, yes. It is hard having her there

13:00.155 --> 13:02.521
and not taking advantage
of the situation.

13:02.616 --> 13:05.608
And, meanwhile, Dyson is
holed up with the most perfect

13:05.702 --> 13:08.614
specimen of Fae womanhood
ever. And good for him.

13:08.705 --> 13:10.696
And the Morrigan, she's all in love.

13:10.791 --> 13:14.033
I mean, she's kind of feeding off his
brain, but she's in love, nonetheless.

13:14.127 --> 13:17.164
And where am |? I'm trudging
through old cabbage.

13:17.255 --> 13:19.837
Jason! Hey!

13:21.843 --> 13:23.424
[BO] Kenzi, no!

13:25.847 --> 13:32.013
There you are, my little crumpet.
Ah, ah, ah. It's not nice to point.

13:32.104 --> 13:35.596
Now, let's see how you like it.

13:38.777 --> 13:40.768
Vex, let him go.

13:43.865 --> 13:48.734
When are you going to learn not
to interfere in Dark Fae business?

13:48.829 --> 13:52.196
Maybe you just aren't seeing
things for how they really are.

13:52.290 --> 13:54.155
Excuse me, Vex, dude.

13:54.251 --> 13:57.084
Look, I know you're all powerful and
you could probably take me down, too.

13:57.170 --> 14:00.628
But if you do, your boys
are coming with me.

14:02.843 --> 14:07.587
Let's have a chat. Fancy a shot?
First round's on me.

14:09.599 --> 14:11.180
Are you okay?

14:17.983 --> 14:21.191
The Morrigan. Smile.

14:24.364 --> 14:28.983
Now, why are you two messing with
an ongoing Dark Fae investigation?

14:29.077 --> 14:33.741
l was hired by the Morrigan to bring
Jason in alive. What were you doing?

14:33.832 --> 14:35.072
l was just having a laugh with him.

14:35.167 --> 14:38.159
Oh, that's such a funny joke.
And how does that one end again?

14:38.253 --> 14:39.834
With me interrogating
that little piss ant

14:39.921 --> 14:42.958
to find out how he knew very
sensitive Dark Fae information.

14:43.050 --> 14:45.041
Why not just wait until I
bring him into the Morrigan?

14:45.135 --> 14:47.251
You can question him then.

14:49.890 --> 14:53.803
I'll let you in on a little secret--
the Morrigan's afraid of me.

14:53.894 --> 14:57.512
You see, I'm even more popular with
the Dark Fae Elders than she is.

14:57.606 --> 15:00.313
And she's just devious enough
to orchestrate this whole mess

15:00.400 --> 15:01.230
to bring me down.

15:01.318 --> 15:05.231
--And how would she do that?
--Oh, she is Jason's muse.

15:05.322 --> 15:06.937
Pulling his strings.

15:07.032 --> 15:10.240
I'll tell you what. You bring him
to me so I can question him

15:10.327 --> 15:13.945
and I'll see to it that a very large
sum of money makes its way

15:14.039 --> 15:18.282
into the pockets of your
tight, tight pants.

15:18.376 --> 15:19.912
I am not going to help
you murder Jason.

15:20.003 --> 15:22.494
No. Blood oath, he won't die.

15:22.589 --> 15:25.581
Just bring him to me so I can
see if my suspicions are right.

15:25.675 --> 15:27.836
See if the Morrigan has
it in for me or not.

15:27.928 --> 15:30.135
--And then?
--|'|| hand Jason back

15:30.222 --> 15:33.055
and you can buy a place with walls.

15:36.520 --> 15:41.480
You know, I wouldn't mind living
pretty on Monsieur Freakshow's dime.

15:41.566 --> 15:45.150
So, what do you think?
Happened already or yet to happen?

15:45.237 --> 15:49.981
Like, did the Morrigan kill someone
or is she intending to kill someone?

15:50.075 --> 15:52.691
I do not like this.

15:52.786 --> 15:54.367
Why don't you go home?

15:54.454 --> 15:58.697
I am going to go and have a
little chat with my new employer.

15:58.792 --> 16:00.373
Good luck.

16:13.014 --> 16:14.595
Let's cut the crap.

16:14.683 --> 16:17.220
I know you did a real nice thing
helping Bo against her mom.

16:17.310 --> 16:22.395
But you also spy-banged her
for the Ash and broke her heart.

16:22.482 --> 16:25.770
She really likes you.

16:25.861 --> 16:28.603
So, if you hurt my best friend again,

16:28.697 --> 16:31.109
one day in the future, anthropologists
will find your skeleton

16:31.199 --> 16:36.535
in an unmarked grave with a massive,
massive life-ending blow to your head

16:36.621 --> 16:41.081
by a totally awesome chick
that rhymes with "frenzy." Okay?

16:41.168 --> 16:44.956
You know, I get the whole
best friend routine, I do.

16:45.046 --> 16:48.288
But if you're trying to be
the only human in Bo's life,

16:48.383 --> 16:50.749
you're not being much of a friend at all.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.755
You're being selfish.

16:52.846 --> 16:55.053
[knocking]

17:00.061 --> 17:02.393
Can I help you?

17:06.735 --> 17:08.191
Oh, boy.

17:10.071 --> 17:12.027
I love what you haven't
done with the place.

17:12.115 --> 17:14.822
Oh.

17:14.910 --> 17:15.740
Thanks.

17:15.827 --> 17:17.203
I'm here for Lauren. Where is she?

17:17.287 --> 17:21.451
Lauren? I haven't seen her in ages.

17:21.541 --> 17:24.908
Is that so?

17:25.003 --> 17:27.335
What's it like being someone's pet?

17:27.422 --> 17:31.381
I do hope that Bo keeps you
on a very tight leash.

17:31.468 --> 17:35.882
Humans have a tendency to run wild
and make such a mess of the place.

17:35.972 --> 17:40.762
Some are so out of control
that they need to be put down.

17:40.852 --> 17:45.141
Well, there are more than a few Fae
I would like to see put down, myself.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.983
Except this one. He is awesome.

17:54.074 --> 17:56.156
Let her go.

17:56.243 --> 17:58.655
That's why I love humans.

17:58.745 --> 18:01.407
Whistle loud enough and they'll come.

18:09.297 --> 18:13.210
You're overstepping your authority by
attacking Bo's human and you know it.

18:13.301 --> 18:18.216
Put her down or what is left of the
Light Fae Elders will hear about this.

18:18.306 --> 18:23.471
|t's merely out of the thinnest wisp
of respect for Bo and her territory

18:23.561 --> 18:27.474
that I haven't had you dragged out
of here by your hair this very second.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.819
Twenty-four hours, Doctor.

18:31.903 --> 18:35.487
And if you haven't wiggled your
little rear end back home by then,

18:35.573 --> 18:38.781
your special research
project goes dark.

18:38.868 --> 18:41.610
l'll pull the plug. And
you can say good-bye--

18:41.705 --> 18:43.787
I'll be there.

18:43.873 --> 18:45.454
Very good.

18:48.878 --> 18:50.539
Put her down.

18:57.304 --> 18:58.760
Kenzi?

19:01.141 --> 19:04.304
Kenzi, I'm so sorry I brought
my problems into your home.

19:04.394 --> 19:07.886
Are you really going back to him?

19:07.981 --> 19:13.021
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, he did
what? Okay, Kenzi, just sit tight.

19:16.323 --> 19:20.783
Hello and good-bye. I'm out. This job
has become way too messy for me.

19:20.869 --> 19:22.325
Go.

19:26.750 --> 19:29.992
l have way more important things to deal
with right now than Dark Fae politics.

19:30.086 --> 19:32.042
And I will not help you put
Jason into an early grave

19:32.130 --> 19:33.836
with your evil musing or whatever.

19:33.923 --> 19:36.175
I wasn't aware of any politics.

19:36.259 --> 19:38.215
Well, Vex certainly is.

19:38.303 --> 19:40.965
He offered to make me rich
if I brought Jason to him first!

19:41.056 --> 19:44.048
Right after he tried to make
me poke my own eyes out.

19:44.142 --> 19:46.975
Vex said that, did he?

19:47.062 --> 19:51.772
Well, then, I think it's perfectly
reasonable that you walk away.

19:51.858 --> 19:55.225
I accept your resignation.

19:55.320 --> 19:58.403
Of course, if you find Jason,

19:58.490 --> 20:04.076
I'll give you the key to fixing Lauren's
situation with the Ash for good.

20:11.669 --> 20:13.375
You okay?

20:13.463 --> 20:17.297
How do you do it? Work for
the Morrigan, day in, day out?

20:17.384 --> 20:18.715
Oh, it's a great job.

20:18.802 --> 20:22.886
It's very high profile and | get to
meet all kinds of interesting artists and

20:22.972 --> 20:23.961
Evony can be hard on me,

20:24.057 --> 20:26.343
but she's just giving me the tools
that I need to make it in this business.

20:26.434 --> 20:28.641
"Evony?
--The Morrigan is her title.

20:28.728 --> 20:32.596
Evony is her name.
Evony Fleurette Marquise.

20:32.690 --> 20:34.681
Pretty.

20:34.776 --> 20:36.516
I came to her looking for
representation as a painter,

20:36.611 --> 20:38.192
but she saw my real ability.

20:38.279 --> 20:39.530
My potential to persuade
the weak-minded

20:39.614 --> 20:42.026
and that is my ticket to
the top of the arts world.

20:42.117 --> 20:43.903
Do you ever miss painting?

20:43.993 --> 20:46.029
No. l was never very good.

20:46.121 --> 20:48.453
Well, thank you for
trying to find Jason.

20:48.540 --> 20:50.451
I'm sorry you won't be continuing
to work for the Morrigan.

20:50.542 --> 20:51.827
And it was very nice to meet you.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.783
Actually, I decided to
give it another shot.

20:53.878 --> 20:56.085
Gonna go after the kid
full-throttle this time.

20:56.172 --> 20:57.127
You seem so adamant.

20:57.215 --> 21:00.628
Well, the Morrigan has
powers of persuasion, herself.

21:00.718 --> 21:03.460
She made me an offer I couldn't refuse.

21:10.562 --> 21:13.895
--Everyone okay?
--We're fine, all things considered.

21:13.982 --> 21:15.597
Where's Kenzi?

21:15.692 --> 21:17.853
She drank some wine.

21:22.282 --> 21:24.568
I think l have some really,
really good news.

21:24.659 --> 21:30.120
Bo, I appreciate everything
you're doing for me, I really do.

21:33.042 --> 21:36.626
|-| can't let you and Kenzi
take this kind of heat for me.

21:36.713 --> 21:38.419
You might not have to go back for long.

21:38.506 --> 21:40.713
--What do you mean?
--If I find Jason,

21:40.800 --> 21:42.882
the Morrigan will tell me how
to free you from this thing

21:42.969 --> 21:45.836
that's tying you to the Ash.

21:45.930 --> 21:50.344
That's really something. Did she
say anything else, any specifics?

21:50.435 --> 21:55.225
No, she wouldn't cough up any details,
but she did give me her blood oath.

21:55.315 --> 21:58.148
And yet, you don't look
as excited as I am.

21:58.234 --> 22:01.852
I am, I guess.

22:01.946 --> 22:05.154
It's just we have no guarantees of
how any of this is going to turn out.

22:05.241 --> 22:09.701
Hey, I will not let
anything happen to you.

22:09.787 --> 22:13.200
I know that you'll try.

22:13.291 --> 22:17.284
But tomorrow, I'll be gone,
maybe forever.

22:25.386 --> 22:29.345
I need to know that this isn't
about you getting over Dyson.

22:29.432 --> 22:33.345
No. This is about us.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.394
Come on, get up.

24:04.444 --> 24:08.483
Ohhh, move it! Move the ugly booze!

24:08.573 --> 24:10.905
[BO] Come on.

24:10.992 --> 24:12.778
Go away.

24:12.869 --> 24:16.236
| feel like a wet dog moved into
my mouth and had puppies.

24:16.331 --> 24:18.367
Kenzi, thank you so
much for standing up

24:18.458 --> 24:21.245
to the Ash and for trying to cover
for Lauren. You are a superstar.

24:21.336 --> 24:22.416
I owe you huge.

24:22.503 --> 24:24.789
Yeah. Well, if they would have
stayed two more seconds,

24:24.881 --> 24:29.375
I would have laid them down a
massive beat down, Russian mafia-style.

24:31.387 --> 24:32.923
Where are you going?

24:33.014 --> 24:36.381
Actually, it's where we're going.
We're meeting Hale at the Dal.

24:36.476 --> 24:38.637
So, come on, get up, get ready.

24:41.230 --> 24:45.018
But you're buying me breakfast.
And Trick better have pancakes

24:45.109 --> 24:49.478
because Mama needs some serious
carbs to soak up Seﬁor Malbec.

24:55.536 --> 24:57.572
Toothpaste?

24:57.664 --> 24:59.325
Foot locker.

25:01.668 --> 25:03.124
Thanks.

25:18.726 --> 25:21.138
You want some pancakes
with that syrup?

25:21.229 --> 25:26.394
One more word, one more word
and I'm having Siren with my syrup.

25:26.484 --> 25:28.270
You're getting nasty in your old age.

25:28.361 --> 25:32.104
She fell into the bottom of two
bottles of wine last night.

25:32.198 --> 25:33.654
Here.

25:35.535 --> 25:37.446
Check this out.

25:37.537 --> 25:41.496
[whistling]

25:43.501 --> 25:45.082
My.

25:50.633 --> 25:55.047
Oh my god, my headache is
gone. How did you do that?

25:55.138 --> 25:57.094
--I got skills.
--Will you marry me?

25:57.181 --> 25:59.388
Nah, you drink too much.

25:59.475 --> 26:01.807
So, how is your old buddy, Dyson?

26:01.894 --> 26:05.637
He's good. You know,
working hard, hitting the gym.

26:05.732 --> 26:06.892
And that pretty blonde?

26:06.983 --> 26:08.519
Ooh, uh...

26:08.609 --> 26:10.520
--Ciara. Yeah, yeah.
--[BO] Right.

26:10.611 --> 26:13.444
She's around, you know.

26:13.531 --> 26:16.819
Awesome. Yeah, that's awesome.

26:19.495 --> 26:23.829
Listen, I wonder if I could borrow
your police expertise for a moment?

26:23.916 --> 26:25.952
I seem to be hitting one
dead end after another.

26:26.043 --> 26:28.170
How do you find someone
who could be anywhere?

26:28.254 --> 26:31.542
Ah, sounds like you
need to see the Eye.

26:31.632 --> 26:35.250
--The Eye?
--Any relation to the schnoz?

26:36.721 --> 26:38.962
Just give me a sec.

26:39.056 --> 26:42.344
Seriously, I feel so much better.

26:42.435 --> 26:43.766
Give me a pancake.

26:43.853 --> 26:47.437
Number six, corner pocket.

26:47.523 --> 26:50.481
Okay. I brought him
and he's willing to help.

26:50.568 --> 26:53.480
Now when you meet him,
just roll with it.

26:53.571 --> 26:55.903
--Roll with what?
--The Eye is Fae.

26:55.990 --> 26:57.605
He snoops for his own
kicks independently

26:57.700 --> 27:00.612
and not even close to legally.
Like seeing into places

27:00.703 --> 27:03.695
maybe he has no business seeing
into, if you catch my drift.

27:03.790 --> 27:07.203
Seeing how far into places
are we talking here?

27:07.293 --> 27:10.456
Dyson and I use his special brand
of expertise once in a while,

27:10.546 --> 27:14.539
for police work. So, we cut
the Eye some slack.

27:14.634 --> 27:18.172
Sometimes, I just think
the price is too high.

27:18.262 --> 27:20.924
Anyway, big guy in
the corner. Have fun.

27:21.015 --> 27:22.255
Well, aren't you staying?

27:22.350 --> 27:27.390
No, you know, I got to work and just
got this back from the cleaners.

27:31.526 --> 27:35.235
--All right, mama bear.
--Okay.

27:35.321 --> 27:37.027
Let's do this.

27:39.700 --> 27:44.285
Hello, Mr. The Eye.

27:44.372 --> 27:46.112
Sir.

27:46.207 --> 27:53.249
Oh, ladies. What a most delicious
climax to my anticipation.

27:53.339 --> 27:56.001
Though, to be honest, I am not
accustomed to enjoining council

27:56.092 --> 27:59.004
until the second stroke of midday.

27:59.095 --> 28:01.211
|t's two o'clock now.

28:01.305 --> 28:04.889
Oh! My heavens, the tall one is right.

28:04.976 --> 28:08.514
'Tis the bigger fool am | for
lost the track of time I did,

28:08.604 --> 28:11.346
whilst sieging the castle.

28:12.817 --> 28:16.230
Might I interest ye fair maidens
in some shared libation?

28:16.320 --> 28:19.812
Buddy, we are not into that. But...

28:19.907 --> 28:24.196
Actually, we're looking for this guy.

28:24.287 --> 28:26.369
| see.

28:29.750 --> 28:32.492
'Cause lam the Eye...

28:35.381 --> 28:39.374
As for remuneration, I'm sure
we will work something out

28:39.468 --> 28:43.006
that would be of
satisfaction to us all, yes?

28:43.097 --> 28:45.053
--Yes.
--Yeah .

29:09.081 --> 29:13.415
Not so fast. What of my payment?

29:13.502 --> 29:15.038
Well, what do you want?

29:15.129 --> 29:20.669
What's her sitch?
I mean, doth she be single?

29:20.760 --> 29:23.627
Oh, yes, she's totally single.

29:23.721 --> 29:27.259
No, I'm not. I just
started dating someone.

29:27.350 --> 29:31.468
Really, Kenzi? What's his name, where's
he from and what does he do for work?

29:31.562 --> 29:36.101
A kiss! One kiss, tender,
supple, and spare.

29:36.192 --> 29:42.813
A kiss, oh yes. A sombre gentle kiss.
A souvenir of the affair.

29:42.907 --> 29:45.774
Oh, wow! That was beautiful.

29:45.868 --> 29:48.610
| wish someone would write
a poem like that for me.

29:48.704 --> 29:51.036
Go for it, Kenzi, you lucky dog.

29:51.123 --> 29:53.159
I can't, he smells like old pants.

29:53.250 --> 29:57.744
Kenzi, Jason's life hangs in the
balance here. Now, nut up, sister.

29:57.838 --> 29:59.294
Go!

30:07.139 --> 30:09.346
Oh.

30:09.433 --> 30:12.550
Oh, sweet taste of nymph!

30:12.645 --> 30:15.557
How seldom you find your way to me.

30:17.066 --> 30:19.808
You must journey to the street of
King to find the man you seek.

30:19.902 --> 30:23.645
Well, we'll just be on
our way. Thank you.

30:25.574 --> 30:28.156
Hate to see you go,
love to watch you leave.

30:31.205 --> 30:34.538
You know why I love working
with you? The glamour.

30:34.625 --> 30:38.163
I mean, who else gets to chase
down a gun-wielding street artist

30:38.254 --> 30:43.374
and make out with a perverted
Cyclops? No one. That's who.

30:43.467 --> 30:45.844
Shh. Keep your eyes peeled for Jason.

30:45.928 --> 30:47.884
Why are you following me?

30:47.972 --> 30:50.509
Jason, I'm working for the Morrigan.

30:50.599 --> 30:53.136
She asked me to come find you
and bring you back to her.

30:53.227 --> 30:57.516
--Who?
--Your agent, Evony.

30:57.606 --> 30:58.732
Evony sent you?

30:58.816 --> 31:01.899
Put the gun down
and I'll take you to her.

31:01.986 --> 31:05.228
No! l have something to do.
Something l have to do.

31:05.322 --> 31:07.904
There's a beginning, a middle, and
an end, and we're nearing the end,

31:07.992 --> 31:11.530
but I just can't see it yet. I can't.

31:11.620 --> 31:13.702
Even when I paint, I can't...

31:13.789 --> 31:18.328
It's like I'm not here anymore.
I can't go back yet.

31:18.419 --> 31:20.205
l have to finish this.

31:22.548 --> 31:24.084
[voices chanting]

31:24.175 --> 31:26.257
Stop! And leave me alone!

31:26.343 --> 31:29.210
--Okay, we'll go. We'll leave you alone.
--No!

31:49.200 --> 31:52.818
Looks like someone's entered
the surrealist phase of his career.

32:03.297 --> 32:07.415
Oh, it's okay. You're home now.
It's all right. It's all right.

32:07.510 --> 32:11.469
Well, there he is. Safe and sound,
just barely, I might add.

32:11.555 --> 32:16.140
Jason, would you go to your room?
l have some business to tend to.

32:16.227 --> 32:18.218
Will you come see me later?

32:18.312 --> 32:22.726
We'll see. Come on,
run along, go. It's okay.

32:24.610 --> 32:26.817
Let me just get what I owe you.

32:26.904 --> 32:30.067
Actually, there's something else.

32:30.157 --> 32:33.775
Let Jason go. I know that
you're in love with him,

32:33.869 --> 32:36.736
but this hold you have
on Jason is killing him.

32:36.831 --> 32:40.915
My god, you are na'ive, aren't you?
I'm not in love with Jason.

32:41.001 --> 32:44.414
| just knew it was the only way to get a
bleeding heart like yourself to help me.

32:44.505 --> 32:46.712
If I were to set Jason free right now,

32:46.799 --> 32:50.041
how would I ever find out
how Vex put him up to all this?

32:50.136 --> 32:53.094
And exactly what kind
of coup he's planning.

32:54.557 --> 32:56.889
Here's the key to saving Nadia.

32:58.644 --> 33:00.100
The deal was to save Lauren.

33:00.187 --> 33:04.055
Yes, but in order to save Lauren,
you must first save Nadia.

33:04.150 --> 33:05.640
Who's Nadia?

33:05.734 --> 33:08.111
She didn't tell you?

33:08.195 --> 33:11.437
Nadia is Lauren's girlfriend.

33:22.334 --> 33:24.165
Why didn't you bring him
to me like we discussed?

33:24.253 --> 33:26.369
He's locked inside now
and I can't get near him.

33:26.463 --> 33:30.752
We never had a deal. And I am never
working for the Dark Fae ever again!

33:30.843 --> 33:33.960
And why doesn't anyone
ever tell the truth?

33:35.264 --> 33:37.300
Lauren?

33:37.391 --> 33:38.847
Hey.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.135
She's gone.

33:48.903 --> 33:51.110
Can I get you anything?

33:51.197 --> 33:57.284
No, thank you. | just want to take
a hot bath and wash this day away.

33:57.369 --> 33:59.451
I am so glad this case is over.

33:59.538 --> 34:04.202
Oh, yeah, about that, the case
coming to an end and all--

34:04.293 --> 34:06.534
I may have discovered
something in Jason's paintings.

34:06.629 --> 34:09.462
Fantastic. I'm so happy
right now, I could throw up.

34:09.548 --> 34:13.132
See? These are two paintings
that form one larger painting.

34:13.219 --> 34:15.084
It's like two panels
of the same picture.

34:15.179 --> 34:17.010
So, you're saying the Morrigan's
going to try and kill Vex?

34:17.097 --> 34:20.260
And Jason somehow found out about it
and painted it all over the city. Yup.

34:20.351 --> 34:23.093
--That doesn't make any sense.
--The Morrigan and Jason were in love.

34:23.187 --> 34:26.520
Pillow talk, baby. She let the goods
slip while they were doing the nasty.

34:26.607 --> 34:29.019
The Morrigan was lying about
being in love with Jason

34:29.109 --> 34:31.191
so that I would take the case.

34:31.278 --> 34:33.894
Oh!

34:33.989 --> 34:34.899
Oh.

34:34.990 --> 34:37.402
And she wouldn't let
something that sensitive slip.

34:37.493 --> 34:39.404
Not to a human,
she's smarter than that.

34:39.495 --> 34:42.953
So, did Vex really set this whole thing
up to make the Morrigan look bad?

34:43.040 --> 34:46.498
I don't know. I mean, someone's
pulling the puppet strings.

34:46.585 --> 34:49.452
But as much as Vex is a total creep,

34:49.546 --> 34:51.707
I think he really did want
to interrogate Jason.

34:51.799 --> 34:55.508
Find out who told him those secrets.
I mean, he gave me his blood oath.

34:55.594 --> 34:58.757
Okay. Okay. But our mysterious
puppet master got Jason

34:58.847 --> 35:01.714
to paint the Morrigan killing Vex. So...

35:01.809 --> 35:04.551
Does that mean someone's
trying to frame the Morrigan?

35:04.645 --> 35:06.260
And topple her from power?

35:06.355 --> 35:10.143
By actually killing Vex.

35:10.234 --> 35:12.520
So, why did Jason have
a total meltdown?

35:12.611 --> 35:16.354
Actually, it was more than a meltdown.
It was like he was resisting something.

35:16.448 --> 35:23.195
Fighting back. Like someone was in
his head, trying to convince him...

35:23.289 --> 35:26.201
Oh, crap.

35:26.292 --> 35:29.284
| whip people because they pay me.

35:29.378 --> 35:32.791
Handcuffs, nipple clamps,
angry yelling, sure.

35:32.881 --> 35:37.250
But murder? Sorry, darling,
that's just not my thing.

35:37.344 --> 35:42.759
And Vex has been a good client
of mine for a very long time.

35:42.850 --> 35:46.889
Yes, but haven't you always wanted
to take your talent to the next level?

35:46.979 --> 35:49.391
This is a logical leap for you.

35:51.942 --> 35:56.857
Yeah, sure. Yeah, I'll do it.

35:56.947 --> 36:00.735
When you think about it, it is a logical
leap for someone in my line of work.

36:00.826 --> 36:02.657
You'll be needing this.

36:22.181 --> 36:24.593
Ah, yes. Come on in.

36:27.102 --> 36:30.344
Do you fancy a glass of bubbly?

36:33.692 --> 36:37.401
Oh, yes, very nice.

36:57.007 --> 37:02.877
You are a stupid, stupid boy
who needs to be disciplined.

37:06.683 --> 37:09.060
Oh, I am so sorry, Mummy.

37:11.605 --> 37:13.971
l have a surprise for you.

37:25.536 --> 37:29.370
W-What do you think you're doing?

37:29.456 --> 37:31.697
Have you lost your bleeding mind?

37:35.337 --> 37:38.750
I don't want to hurt you, lady.
Now step away from the pervert.

37:46.056 --> 37:47.262
What kind of Fae is this?

37:47.349 --> 37:49.260
The human kind.

37:51.437 --> 37:53.052
Now get my hands free!

37:53.147 --> 37:55.308
--Where's the key?
--In the purse.

37:58.861 --> 38:01.068
God, I thought I had
a lot of crap in my bag.

38:01.155 --> 38:04.067
Oh, Kenzi, hurry! Hurry!

38:07.786 --> 38:12.746
Well, well, well!

38:12.833 --> 38:15.290
Decisions, decisions, decisions.

38:15.377 --> 38:21.247
At times like this, one must always
ask what would be most fun?

38:29.016 --> 38:31.883
This one is innocent.

38:31.977 --> 38:34.764
And what the hell are you wearing?

38:38.108 --> 38:41.600
Your plan to murder me failed.
And in a lovely twist of irony,

38:41.695 --> 38:45.904
your friend, the Dominatrix,
now finds herself in bondage.

38:45.991 --> 38:48.653
l have had quite enough
of your accusations.

38:48.744 --> 38:51.656
No, no, no, not you.

38:51.747 --> 38:54.329
Her.

38:54.416 --> 38:56.657
We know you've been
manipulating Jason.

38:56.752 --> 38:58.834
Pitting Vex against the Morrigan,
trying to frame her.

38:58.921 --> 39:02.539
Do you understand the war
you could have started?

39:04.968 --> 39:10.008
You treated me like a dog.
All you do is take and steal

39:10.098 --> 39:12.635
and you step on other people's
dreams like they don't matter.

39:12.726 --> 39:16.014
Because nothing mattered
but your bottom line.

39:16.104 --> 39:20.939
Well, I wanted to see you suffer for all
of those poor artists that you ruined.

39:21.026 --> 39:23.312
I needed to see you suffer.

39:26.448 --> 39:30.532
l was a painter and
you took that from me.

39:33.330 --> 39:36.618
And | just wanted to make
something beautiful.

39:36.708 --> 39:38.289
Bianca, no!

39:51.431 --> 39:53.092
Let's not fight anymore.

39:53.183 --> 39:59.349
It's a promise. As always,
I am your loyal servant.

39:59.439 --> 40:01.646
You know, you really must
come to my club for a piss-up.

40:01.733 --> 40:03.894
You know, the full V.|.P.
treatment, on me.

40:03.986 --> 40:07.023
I want four young men, gorgeous.

40:07.114 --> 40:08.945
As you wish.

40:12.661 --> 40:17.030
Yes, it's me. Would you send a
cleaning crew up to my office?

40:17.124 --> 40:21.367
My assistant's made a terrible mess.

40:21.461 --> 40:23.247
How can you be so callous?

40:23.338 --> 40:26.125
Why? Did something just happen?

40:26.216 --> 40:27.831
You are sick.

40:27.926 --> 40:31.384
Did you give Lauren the good
news about her girlfriend?

40:33.807 --> 40:35.968
I'm sorry I can't walk you out.

40:36.059 --> 40:39.722
I seem to be short-staffed
at the moment.

40:44.443 --> 40:46.434
This was not a good day.

40:46.528 --> 40:49.144
Hey! Cheer up, mama bear.
It wasn't a total failure.

40:49.239 --> 40:51.571
We did snag ourselves a door prize.

40:51.658 --> 40:53.398
Do we really have to keep him tied up?

40:53.493 --> 40:55.870
Hey, he's no different
than a heroin addict.

40:55.954 --> 41:00.994
We untie him now and he'll be
right back at the teat... so to speak.

41:01.084 --> 41:06.078
Nope. This boy's got a one-way
ticket to hot bitch rehab.

41:06.173 --> 41:09.631
We sneaky, sneaky.

41:09.718 --> 41:13.427
--Boom.
--Bring it back. Yeah.

41:20.270 --> 41:26.061
Weird not having the doc here, isn't it?
Just when l was getting used to her.

41:29.363 --> 41:32.696
What's up, babe?

41:32.783 --> 41:34.148
Lauren stuff.

41:34.242 --> 41:38.281
Did you get her pregnant?

41:38.372 --> 41:42.581
I'm sorry. What is it?

41:42.668 --> 41:46.081
According to the Morrigan,

41:46.171 --> 41:48.162
Lauren has a girlfriend.

41:48.256 --> 41:50.588
Dude, I told her if she
screwed you over again,

41:50.676 --> 41:52.587
l was going to bash her brains in.

41:52.678 --> 41:54.885
I don't know what to do.

41:54.971 --> 42:01.388
I mean, save her from the Ash,
obviously, but after that.

42:01.478 --> 42:05.721
Should I confront her? Should I be mad?
Do I even have a right to be mad?

42:05.816 --> 42:09.980
I mean, who is this
girlfriend, anyway? And...

42:10.070 --> 42:13.528
...how come she hasn't
once mentioned her?

42:13.615 --> 42:16.027
I can't believe I'm about to say this,

42:16.118 --> 42:20.657
but I think you should
give her a chance to explain.

42:20.747 --> 42:23.659
Maybe she has her reasons, you know.

42:35.762 --> 42:39.346
Hey,babe.

42:39.433 --> 42:43.722
| just wanted you to know
that I'm working really hard.

42:43.812 --> 42:49.773
I'm still trying to help you, I promise.

42:49.860 --> 42:54.103
You know, if you could meet
Bo, you'd really like her.

42:54.197 --> 42:56.574
She's such a good person.

42:58.577 --> 43:01.569
She's so trustworthy.

43:01.663 --> 43:07.078
She has this big, huge heart.

43:07.169 --> 43:10.878
And she's strong. She's so strong.

43:13.008 --> 43:16.421
And she takes care of me.

43:16.511 --> 43:22.632
Imagine that. Somebody
taking care of me for a change.
