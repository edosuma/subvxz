Come here, come here.

13:20.551 --> 13:22.761
Come here.
Sit down, come here.

13:23.220 --> 13:24.698
This guy loves
having his belly rubbed.

13:24.722 --> 13:26.056
What's he sniffing out?

13:27.224 --> 13:28.224
Explosives.

13:28.267 --> 13:31.562
We go in before the convoy,
sniff out IEDs, make sure no one gets hurt.

13:32.646 --> 13:33.856
You guys on the front lines?

13:34.732 --> 13:36.452
Sometimes we're in
front of the front lines.

13:37.568 --> 13:39.570
Zeus here is a beast,
aren't ya?

13:40.571 --> 13:41.655
Is he yours?

13:41.739 --> 13:44.241
No, he belongs to the Corps,
but he's mine for now.

13:45.576 --> 13:46.827
What are you
here for, training?

13:46.911 --> 13:48.871
No, I'm cleaning out
the kennels for a week.

13:50.498 --> 13:51.957
How do you get to do that?

Hey, Cindy.
(CLICKING TONGUE)

14:19.652 --> 14:21.987
Okay, Lance Corporal Walters,
you be the handler.

14:22.446 --> 14:23.656
You're still the decoy!

14:24.448 --> 14:25.533
Let's give Cindy a break.

14:28.577 --> 14:30.162
Oh, no, I'm good.
(SIGHS) Sucks, huh?

14:30.496 --> 14:31.580
Yeah.

14:32.248 --> 14:34.667
You know, I usually take the
pants off, just keep the top on.

14:34.959 --> 14:36.043
Really?

14:36.126 --> 14:37.366
Dogs know to aim
for the jacket.

14:38.546 --> 14:39.797
Thanks.

this one, you approach.

14:57.898 --> 15:01.026
You listen to his spiel
and then start to run, okay?

15:02.695 --> 15:04.029
If Rex attacks,
you call him off.

to see some ID.

aggressive moves,

15:12.746 --> 15:14.415
my dog is trained
to attack you.

Get him, get him. Get him.

15:21.547 --> 15:23.215

I am afraid of you.

16:19.438 --> 16:20.939
Gunny, how do I become
a dog handler?

16:22.024 --> 16:23.108
You?
Yeah.

16:23.901 --> 16:25.235
What do I have to do exactly?

16:25.944 --> 16:28.197
For starters, you need
to stop screwing up.

16:29.239 --> 16:30.991
Then, you'll need
an expert rifle score,

16:31.283 --> 16:34.662
above 90% on all your exams,
a first class PFT,

16:34.745 --> 16:36.205
and you know who
gets those things?

16:36.789 --> 16:38.332
People who
aren't full of shit.

16:38.666 --> 16:41.210
Gunny, I've been dealing with a
lot of shit the past few days,

16:41.293 --> 16:42.933
and I can assure you,
I am not full of it.

16:43.420 --> 16:47.508
Well, that would surprise me,
because unless I heard wrong,

16:47.591 --> 16:50.344
you were just found pissing outside
the Provost Marshal's office.

16:50.427 --> 16:51.427
The Provost Marshal?

16:51.470 --> 16:54.240
And that's definitely the act of a
full-of-shit person, don't you think?

16:54.264 --> 16:55.349

Gunny, do you have a dog for me?
No.

19:10.275 --> 19:11.527
Did I excuse you?

19:15.113 --> 19:16.698
But I do got a can, though.

Because you look like one.

BROWN: Hey!

59:00.163 --> 59:01.497
How did your dog miss that?

59:01.581 --> 59:02.874
You could have
got us all killed.

59:03.750 --> 59:06.044
GOMEZ: I never seen
an IED buried this deep.

59:09.881 --> 59:11.007
You gotta see this.

59:11.382 --> 59:13.426
They must have triggered
the bomb from those houses.

59:13.509 --> 59:15.303
I don't know, maybe
they were targeting Rex.

59:15.386 --> 59:16.864

targeting Leavey and Rex.

Let's get those cowards.

59:18.097 --> 59:20.017
Radio Morales, get him and
his dog down here now.

59:20.058 --> 59:22.644
No, if we wait for Morales,
the spotters will be gone by then.

59:22.727 --> 59:24.395
We can do it.
No way, forget it.

59:24.479 --> 59:26.648
Do you see how many
IEDs we found today?

59:26.731 --> 59:28.334
How are you gonna make it
through the field without us?

59:28.358 --> 59:29.585
God damn it, Leavey,
you're injured.

59:29.609 --> 59:32.946
Yeah, because those assholes
waited all day watching us.

59:33.029 --> 59:34.256
CORPSMAN: She's got
a concussion, Sergeant.

59:34.280 --> 59:35.949
She may be confused,
disoriented.

59:36.032 --> 59:37.075
They almost killed us.

59:37.158 --> 59:40.286
How are you gonna make it through
the field and the house without us?

59:40.370 --> 59:41.955
What about your dog?
He's injured, too.

59:55.343 --> 59:56.386
He's fine.

We can do this.

waiting for? Move, move!

Yeah.

01:01:02.702 --> 01:01:03.995
It's a pressure plate.

It's Gomez.
What do you want me to do?

01:02:50.893 --> 01:02:52.395
I don't know,
something's not right.

01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:55.273
He just got blown up, man.
I don't know what's going on.

01:12:24.508 --> 01:12:26.343
I don't know. I haven't
seen him in a while.

01:12:26.427 --> 01:12:27.428
Is he okay?

01:12:27.511 --> 01:12:29.406
I don't know how he is,
but I've been crap without him.

01:12:29.430 --> 01:12:31.849
Yeah, yeah,
I can't imagine.

01:12:31.932 --> 01:12:35.019
I haven't left Bruno
for what, 12 hours?

01:12:35.102 --> 01:12:36.353
Who's a good boy, Bruno?

01:12:36.437 --> 01:12:38.313
REYNOLDS:
Yes, sir, I'll tell her.

01:12:38.397 --> 01:12:40.274
Hey, you can go and cuddle,
too, if you like.

01:12:40.357 --> 01:12:41.608
Rex just pulled up
to the gate.

01:12:41.692 --> 01:12:43.569
Bruno, Bruno.
Bye, sir.

01:12:43.652 --> 01:12:44.778
All right.

01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:48.449
MEGAN: Hey, hi!

01:12:48.991 --> 01:12:51.160
Come here, come here, good boy.

01:12:51.618 --> 01:12:53.871
Careful, careful.

01:12:54.371 --> 01:12:58.375
Good boy, good, hi, good.

01:13:00.085 --> 01:13:01.503
Oh! Good boy.

01:13:14.516 --> 01:13:15.934
Okay.

01:13:16.393 --> 01:13:21.065
Good boy, good boy, good boy,
good boy, good boy.

01:13:33.118 --> 01:13:34.495
Good.

01:13:34.870 --> 01:13:36.955
Good, good, come on.

01:13:38.165 --> 01:13:40.084
Come on, stop, this way.

01:13:40.626 --> 01:13:43.670
Rex, come, it's okay.

01:13:50.511 --> 01:13:53.180
Hey, what's going on?

01:13:53.263 --> 01:13:55.099
They told me I didn't
need the bottoms.

01:13:57.101 --> 01:13:58.828
Yeah, well that depends on
how much you like keeping

01:13:58.852 --> 01:14:00.270
both halves of your ass.

01:14:00.354 --> 01:14:01.522
Keep them on.

01:14:03.482 --> 01:14:04.650
Ha-ha!

01:14:04.733 --> 01:14:05.943
You guys are very funny!

01:14:09.154 --> 01:14:10.948
Okay, slow down,
slow down, slow down,

01:14:11.031 --> 01:14:12.658
it's just some flowers,
it's okay.

01:14:21.375 --> 01:14:22.668
MORALES: It's... (STUTTERS)

01:14:22.751 --> 01:14:25.254
The crazy part, then they
ended up having loofahs,

01:14:25.337 --> 01:14:28.799
but they said they
couldn't deliver a loofah.

01:14:29.842 --> 01:14:31.468
It was sweet,
that's really sweet.

01:14:31.718 --> 01:14:33.303
I mean, I like flowers,
too.

01:14:33.387 --> 01:14:35.264
Cool, but the loofah
would have been, come on.

01:14:35.347 --> 01:14:36.366
That would have
been funnier, yeah.

01:14:36.390 --> 01:14:37.784
The loofah would have worked, right?
Yeah, yeah.

01:14:37.808 --> 01:14:39.101
I know. Um...

01:14:39.643 --> 01:14:41.019
So, hi.

01:14:41.103 --> 01:14:42.229
Hi.
Hey.

01:14:48.610 --> 01:14:49.903
(MEGAN CHUCKLES)

01:14:50.904 --> 01:14:52.406
Wow, you're really strong.

01:14:57.911 --> 01:15:00.205
MORALES: They're like college
beds, like dorm room beds.

01:15:00.289 --> 01:15:01.582
MEGAN: It's awful.
Yeah.

01:15:01.999 --> 01:15:04.126
Well, the good news is
you probably don't have

01:15:04.209 --> 01:15:05.209
to pay for drinks anymore

01:15:05.252 --> 01:15:06.892
now that you're a war hero
and everything.

01:15:07.462 --> 01:15:08.839
You think I'm a hero?

01:15:08.922 --> 01:15:11.508
Well, that's the word
on the street.

01:15:11.592 --> 01:15:12.926
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

01:15:13.218 --> 01:15:14.946
So what have you been up to?
What's going on?

01:15:14.970 --> 01:15:18.265
Um, mostly just physical therapy.
It's the worst.

01:15:19.391 --> 01:15:22.769
The nurse is an absolute
witch, so that's not fun.

01:15:23.437 --> 01:15:24.771
Ai!
Yeah.

01:15:24.855 --> 01:15:26.440
So, what hurts?
Where does it hurt?

01:15:27.024 --> 01:15:28.025
Um...

01:15:28.192 --> 01:15:29.443
Mostly my head.

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:32.863
My back, my neck,

01:15:32.946 --> 01:15:35.032
and I just...

01:15:35.115 --> 01:15:36.950
It feels like the bomb
blew out my arches.

01:15:37.951 --> 01:15:39.077
So everywhere.
Mmm-hmm.

01:15:39.995 --> 01:15:42.831
Well, no more
high heels for you.

01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:45.626
I know, so bummed about that.

01:15:46.793 --> 01:15:47.878
Hey, let me get your foot.

01:15:47.961 --> 01:15:49.046
Let me do some magic.

01:15:49.129 --> 01:15:50.839
A massage?
Yeah.

01:15:50.964 --> 01:15:53.300
Just 'cause you're a hero.
(LAUGHS)

01:15:53.383 --> 01:15:54.509
Lucky me.

01:15:54.593 --> 01:15:55.636
Heroes get massages.

01:15:55.719 --> 01:15:57.179
I should get exploded
more often.

01:15:57.262 --> 01:15:59.264
Yeah, I should
fly back more often.

01:16:00.224 --> 01:16:01.642
How's your boy,
Rex, doing?

01:16:03.227 --> 01:16:04.519
MEGAN: He's good.

01:16:05.646 --> 01:16:07.481
He's doing better,
it's just slow.

01:16:08.148 --> 01:16:10.043
I think that I'm gonna be able
to start training with him again

01:16:10.067 --> 01:16:11.193
in a couple weeks.

01:16:11.652 --> 01:16:12.861
Hmm.

01:16:14.488 --> 01:16:15.781
How long do I have you for?

01:16:17.157 --> 01:16:18.617
Well, that depends.

01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:19.910
How long do you want me for?

01:16:20.786 --> 01:16:23.163
I'm a young man, we live into
our 80s in my family. Oh!

01:16:24.498 --> 01:16:25.916
Yeah, we get divorced
in mine.

01:16:25.999 --> 01:16:27.000
Mmm.

01:16:27.292 --> 01:16:28.972
I could possibly make
an exception, though,

01:16:29.002 --> 01:16:32.506
if you were all of a sudden,
say, a Yankees fan,

01:16:32.589 --> 01:16:34.091
went to a lot
of Yankees games.

01:16:34.174 --> 01:16:36.927
That's a lot, you see,
that's a lot to ask for.

01:16:37.010 --> 01:16:38.679
Yeah, that's what
I thought.

01:16:39.930 --> 01:16:41.473
I'm being serious.

01:16:44.434 --> 01:16:46.019
Well, so am I.

01:16:46.895 --> 01:16:49.439
I don't do the whole
forever and ever thing.

01:16:49.523 --> 01:16:51.858
Look, trust me,
neither do I, usually.

01:16:51.942 --> 01:16:54.111
Okay, well,
so stop being so serious.

01:16:54.194 --> 01:16:56.530

Let's just make out.

Don't say anything.

01:17:10.836 --> 01:17:12.556
We could get in trouble,
though, right? Yes.

01:17:13.213 --> 01:17:14.840
I think we should relocate...

01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:17.592

give you two weeks,

that I love even more, and, um...

would write me a letter

are you doing?

me when you decided

01:22:21.146 --> 01:22:23.523
to leave the Marines,
and I wouldn't expect you to.

I'm happy...

know this would piss me off.

talked about this.
