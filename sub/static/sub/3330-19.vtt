00:04.771 --> 00:06.705
Walter:
<i>My name is walter o'brien.</i>

00:06.707 --> 00:10.776
<i>I have the fourth highest iq</i>
<i>ever recorded: 197.</i>

00:10.778 --> 00:13.012
<i>Einstein's was 160.</i>

00:13.014 --> 00:15.414
<i>When I was 11, the fbi</i>
<i>arrested me for hacking nasa</i>

00:15.416 --> 00:18.050
<i>To get their blueprints</i>
<i>for my bedroom wall.</i>

00:18.052 --> 00:20.219
<i>Now I run a team of geniuses,</i>

00:20.221 --> 00:23.155
<i>Tackling worldwide threats</i>
<i>only we can solve.</i>

00:23.157 --> 00:25.090
<i>Toby's our behaviorist.</i>

00:25.092 --> 00:26.725
Sylvester's a human calculator.

00:26.727 --> 00:29.094
<i>Happy, a mechanical prodigy.</i>

00:29.096 --> 00:31.430
<i>Agent cabe gallo's</i>
<i>our government handler.</i>

00:31.432 --> 00:33.565
<i>And paige?</i>
<i>Well, paige isn't like us.</i>

00:33.567 --> 00:36.135
<i>She's normal</i>
<i>and translates the world for us</i>

00:36.137 --> 00:38.637
<i>While we help her understand</i>
<i>her genius son.</i>

00:38.639 --> 00:40.172
<i>Together, we are scorpion.</i>

00:52.052 --> 00:53.719
Think we should go east.

00:53.721 --> 00:55.654
That's west.

00:55.656 --> 00:57.823
Well, still should go that way.

00:57.825 --> 01:00.092
Yeah?
Based on what?

01:02.128 --> 01:03.295
This is your fault!

01:03.297 --> 01:04.830
You had to take us
off the trail.

01:04.832 --> 01:06.265
You had to see
that damn waterfall!

01:06.267 --> 01:09.735
Oh, well, a lot of good
that does us now, huh?

01:09.737 --> 01:12.538
Day and a half with no water,
food or cell reception.

01:12.540 --> 01:14.206
And the kids are terrified.

01:14.208 --> 01:15.207
And you two
aren't helping.

01:15.209 --> 01:16.642
Let's just keep moving

01:16.644 --> 01:18.277
And try to get
back to a road.

01:18.279 --> 01:20.779
We'll get you out of here.
I promise.

01:26.219 --> 01:27.252
Toby:
Whoa!

01:27.254 --> 01:28.253
(grunts)

01:28.255 --> 01:31.123
Winds of santa ana.

01:31.125 --> 01:33.192
She's a-blowin' a-leeward
and a-windward.

01:34.327 --> 01:36.161
That is sailor talk.

01:36.163 --> 01:38.430
Actually, those terms
just relate

01:38.432 --> 01:40.699
To one's position
to the wind.

01:40.701 --> 01:42.534
It's not exclusive
to sailing.

01:42.536 --> 01:44.536
In fact,
I'm about to show you

01:44.538 --> 01:46.505
How it applies
to aeronautics.

01:46.507 --> 01:51.677
Down the telephone wires,
straighten at ground level,

01:51.679 --> 01:54.379
Then across the street
and through that window.

01:54.381 --> 01:56.248
You're on.
If I win, dinner date.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.217
If you win, I do your laundry
for a month.

01:58.219 --> 02:01.787
You'd probably like that
more than the dinner, perv.

02:14.234 --> 02:16.602
I'm feeling greek,
maybe tex-mex.

02:16.604 --> 02:20.239
The bet is null and void
on account of that truck.

02:20.241 --> 02:21.640
You said you'd get
it in the window,

02:21.642 --> 02:22.741
And it ain't
in the window.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.443
I'm the gambling expert.

02:24.445 --> 02:26.512
We be datin'.

02:28.314 --> 02:29.648
Paige:
Ooh, great.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.250
Coffee's ready.

02:31.252 --> 02:32.251
Oh.

02:32.253 --> 02:34.453
Yes.

02:34.455 --> 02:36.288
Mmm. Perfect.

02:36.290 --> 02:37.456
Thanks, walter.

02:37.458 --> 02:39.158
Walter, a minute of your time.

02:39.160 --> 02:41.260
Mm-hmm.

02:41.262 --> 02:42.661
Yeah. Mmm.

02:51.905 --> 02:53.705
Oh. What is this?

02:53.707 --> 02:55.374
This is outreach.

02:55.376 --> 02:57.910
Now, as you know, drew comes
back from portland soon.

02:57.912 --> 03:00.345
He's gonna come back full
of confidence and swagger.

03:00.347 --> 03:02.247
And what did those alpha-jocks
all want?

03:03.216 --> 03:05.617
The cheerleader.

03:05.619 --> 03:08.253
Aka paige dineen.

03:08.255 --> 03:10.389
Why is paige's personal life
my concern?

03:10.391 --> 03:12.257
Right here is why.
I've been collecting data

03:12.259 --> 03:15.527
The past few months,
and the result is

03:15.529 --> 03:19.364
An iron-clad theorem that proves
you have feelings for paige.

03:19.366 --> 03:21.366
(laughs)

03:21.368 --> 03:22.834
That's preposterous.

03:22.836 --> 03:25.337
In the face of
scientific evidence.

03:26.739 --> 03:29.308
While you're at it, how 'bout
you get no vaccines today?

03:30.577 --> 03:32.277
You want to take
this for a spin?

03:35.748 --> 03:37.950
Remember the reservation
you made for

03:37.952 --> 03:40.252
A valentine's day
"work dinner"?

03:40.254 --> 03:41.520
We never ended up
having the meal.

03:41.522 --> 03:42.454
Okay.

03:42.456 --> 03:44.923
Lavender diffuser
in your office?

03:44.925 --> 03:46.758
That is to mask the smell

03:46.760 --> 03:48.293
Of experiment-generated
mouse urine.

03:48.295 --> 03:49.294
That's disgusting.

03:49.296 --> 03:50.295
But also a lie.

03:50.297 --> 03:51.997
Paige loves lavender.

03:51.999 --> 03:54.433
That hand cream of hers
is always stinking up the van.

03:55.635 --> 03:56.802
Finally...

03:58.771 --> 04:00.305
<i>...Coffea arabica.</i>

04:00.307 --> 04:02.541
Why do you think I've
been getting my joe

04:02.543 --> 04:03.809
At kovelski's?

04:03.811 --> 04:06.812
Because you put cinnamon
in our pot here.

04:06.814 --> 04:10.716
It has antioxidants
and improves brain function.

04:10.718 --> 04:11.750
Cinnamon's for elves.

04:11.752 --> 04:12.918
You put cinnamon
in the coffee

04:12.920 --> 04:14.753
Because she likes it.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.888
You're giving her
special treatment,

04:16.890 --> 04:18.423
Which can only mean...

04:19.559 --> 04:21.827
(grunting)

04:21.829 --> 04:22.828
And how old are you?

04:22.830 --> 04:24.463
13 months older than you,

04:24.465 --> 04:25.764
So show your elders respect.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.866
What is...

04:27.868 --> 04:30.802
(quietly): What is with
the almost constantly commenting

04:30.804 --> 04:32.738
On me and paige lately?

04:32.740 --> 04:34.740
It's borderline obsessive.

04:34.742 --> 04:36.575
As a student of human behavior,

04:36.577 --> 04:38.777
I find emotional dishonesty
offensive.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.912
And also, you're
my friend.

04:40.914 --> 04:42.948
Also, I don't like drew.

04:42.950 --> 04:45.050
(phone ringing)

04:45.052 --> 04:47.319
You're not saved
by the bell.

04:49.822 --> 04:51.023
Yeah, cabe.

04:51.025 --> 04:52.624
Got a case, urgent.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.559
<i>We got six hikers</i>
<i>from a church group</i>

04:54.561 --> 04:55.961
<i>Lost in los angeles</i>
<i>national forest.</i>

04:55.963 --> 04:57.529
Been missing for 36 hours.

04:57.531 --> 04:59.598
Santa ana winds are kicking up

04:59.600 --> 05:02.401
<i>The forest floor,</i>
<i>killing visibility.</i>

05:02.403 --> 05:03.935
<i>Search and rescue</i>
<i>is damn near impossible.</i>

05:03.937 --> 05:06.972
<i>Lafd and the forest service</i>
<i>need an assist.</i>

05:06.974 --> 05:09.308
<i>Your tracking software</i>

05:09.310 --> 05:11.343
<i>From the baghdad operation</i>
<i>years back--</i>

05:11.345 --> 05:13.745
<i>Maybe dusting that off.</i>

05:28.795 --> 05:30.829
Cabe: Winds have gotten
worse since we spoke.

05:30.831 --> 05:31.930
We don't have
any time to waste.

05:32.899 --> 05:34.900
Must be the hikers' families.

05:34.902 --> 05:37.002
Cabe:
Alongside members

05:37.004 --> 05:38.837
Of their church.

05:41.507 --> 05:43.742
My system uses a camera
and laser scanners

05:43.744 --> 05:44.976
To conduct advanced
ground imaging

05:44.978 --> 05:47.112
That can penetrate
tree cover

05:47.114 --> 05:50.082
And recognize ground patterns
at high altitudes.

05:50.084 --> 05:51.683
Basically, our
stuff sees good.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.552
You built this for fun?

05:53.554 --> 05:56.488
Well, let's just say I, uh...

05:56.490 --> 05:59.658
I modified an old system
from way back.

05:59.660 --> 06:01.993
Cabe: My guys will
locate the hikers,

06:01.995 --> 06:04.863
Radio in the coordinates;
the rescue team can do its job.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.431
Happy: We need
to see whatever

06:06.433 --> 06:07.766
Your people have done so far.

06:11.537 --> 06:14.539
It's an interesting use
of my baghdad software.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.775
How did you think to apply it
to this situation?

06:16.777 --> 06:20.579
I think about what happened
in baghdad a lot.

06:20.581 --> 06:21.813
What happened
between us.

06:21.815 --> 06:22.814
Maybe your tech--

06:22.816 --> 06:24.783
Some good can come from it now.

06:24.785 --> 06:26.952
Sylvester:
Walter, you got to see this.

06:26.954 --> 06:29.755
Right before they went
on the hike.

06:29.757 --> 06:31.590
They've been out of cell range
ever since.

06:31.592 --> 06:34.559
Well, that's all we need
to find the hikers.
How?

06:34.561 --> 06:35.961
You've been looking
for where the hikers are.

06:35.963 --> 06:38.497
That's one specific place
in a specific moment in time,

06:38.499 --> 06:39.598
And it's constantly moving.

06:39.600 --> 06:40.832
The footprints, however,

06:40.834 --> 06:42.934
They can last for hours,
even in this wind,

06:42.936 --> 06:45.003
And they could be
a road map right to them.

06:45.005 --> 06:49.007
Okay, so these treads
are the kids' sneakers.

06:49.009 --> 06:50.909
Two are piece-wise lines,

06:50.911 --> 06:52.978
Other is
a cross-hatch pattern.

06:52.980 --> 06:55.914
Approximate sizes:
Two boys' size nine

06:55.916 --> 06:57.716
And a girls' six.

06:57.718 --> 06:59.451
The adults are
wearing hiking boots

06:59.453 --> 07:01.420
With standard waffle patterns,

07:01.422 --> 07:03.522
And the woman's got
an outside heel break.

07:03.524 --> 07:04.956
Scan the images.

07:04.958 --> 07:07.058
One of the men will be in
front, one of them in back.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.928
It's standard defense formation,
wired into animal dna--

07:09.930 --> 07:11.730
They don't even know
they're doing it.

07:11.732 --> 07:16.034
With the youngest girl-- a
mothering instinct to protect.

07:16.036 --> 07:18.003
If you look at the,
uh, body language

07:18.005 --> 07:20.005
Of these two youngsters here,
they're in love.

07:20.007 --> 07:21.473
They're side by side.

07:21.475 --> 07:23.775
You can tell they're in love
just from the photo?

07:23.777 --> 07:26.511
Oh, I can tell
lots of ways.

07:26.513 --> 07:28.513
The others will
follow standard

07:28.515 --> 07:30.916
Pack formation and fall in
here and here.

07:30.918 --> 07:33.218
We'll be looking
for a shape like this

07:33.220 --> 07:34.786
Filled with tread patterns

07:34.788 --> 07:36.788
That we can distinguish from
mountain lion drag marks,

07:36.790 --> 07:38.023
Windswept debris.

07:38.025 --> 07:39.624
That'll let us
find our folks.

07:39.626 --> 07:42.661
Uh, where's our workstation?

07:43.996 --> 07:45.764
Sylvester:
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

07:45.766 --> 07:47.933
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

07:47.935 --> 07:49.134
Walter, I am not
going up in that thing.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.002
Helicopters have
zero aerodynamics

07:51.004 --> 07:52.971
And no glide ability
in case of engine failure.

07:52.973 --> 07:53.905
That's our
only choice.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.540
It's a box
held up in the sky

07:55.542 --> 07:57.843
By a lawnmower blade. Pass.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.878
Hope you're up for a
little handholding today.

08:03.616 --> 08:05.584
Walter:
Sly, we need you.

08:05.586 --> 08:06.918
No one can run

08:06.920 --> 08:08.820
The analytics
as fast as you can.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.155
Walter, I want to help,

08:10.157 --> 08:12.791
But I can't willingly
board a death trap

08:12.793 --> 08:13.925
Designed by
leonardo da vinci

08:13.927 --> 08:15.527
500 years ago.

08:15.529 --> 08:16.561
Then stay here!

08:18.264 --> 08:20.632
'cause I got a strict
no-crybabies policy.

08:20.634 --> 08:23.101
Meet your pilot,
marcus bronson.

08:23.103 --> 08:24.970
Marcus: Look, you
don't want to come,

08:24.972 --> 08:26.771
Don't come,
but once you get on board,

08:26.773 --> 08:28.106
You need keep it together,
you understand?

08:29.175 --> 08:30.809
It's serious
business up there.

08:30.811 --> 08:32.878
I can't have anyone
freaking out in my bird.

08:34.647 --> 08:36.248
Hey, what'd you mean,
our pilot? You're not coming?

08:36.250 --> 08:37.949
There's no room in the cabin.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.985
So I'll stay back and
gear up with the rescue team.

08:39.987 --> 08:42.821
Once you send in
the hikers' locations, we go in.

08:42.823 --> 08:44.289
This is a sat phone.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.825
Works where the
cell phones don't.

08:46.827 --> 08:49.194
Keep it close to you.
It's your lifeline.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.029
Marcus:
Hey!

08:51.031 --> 08:53.732
You scratch it, you buy it.

08:55.001 --> 08:56.201
He's fun.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.869
Are you good?

08:57.871 --> 08:58.837
Sure.

08:58.839 --> 08:59.971
Okay. Let's go.

08:59.973 --> 09:03.008
Okay.

09:03.010 --> 09:05.777
Toby: <i>We know you have</i>
<i>a lot of choices when you fly,</i>

09:05.779 --> 09:09.581
So we want to thank you
for flying with air scorpion.

09:09.583 --> 09:11.750
Please, no
unnecessary words.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.285
Big guy barfs, you guys
are cleaning it up.

09:14.921 --> 09:16.588
Everything's going to be fine.

09:16.590 --> 09:19.591
Just look at your laptop and
avoid peripheral vision, okay?

09:25.598 --> 09:27.065
Now, our predictive model

09:27.067 --> 09:28.934
Says they headed downhill
west-southwest,

09:28.936 --> 09:31.069
With a statistical
likelihood of 94%,

09:31.071 --> 09:32.704
So bank west here.

09:35.207 --> 09:36.308
I got a hit.

09:36.310 --> 09:38.743
Happy, you seeing this?

09:38.745 --> 09:40.078
Happy:
Yup.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.112
The treads match our hikers.

09:41.114 --> 09:42.213
The formation they're walking in

09:42.215 --> 09:43.982
Is spot on with my prediction.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.050
Okay, pilot,
stay the current course

09:45.052 --> 09:46.351
While we close in on them.

09:47.320 --> 09:48.720
Ooh.

09:48.722 --> 09:49.988
Everything okay?

09:49.990 --> 09:51.089
Wind's up to 50 knots.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.090
It's gonna get bumpy.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.091
Hold on.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.192
Cabe, do you copy?

09:54.194 --> 09:55.660
Copy, walter.

09:55.662 --> 09:56.962
Walter:
It's good news.

09:56.964 --> 09:57.963
We found the hikers' trail.

09:57.965 --> 09:59.864
Within minutes, we find them.

09:59.866 --> 10:01.933
That's great work.
What's your location?

10:01.935 --> 10:04.002
Hey, captain charisma,
where are we?

10:04.004 --> 10:05.103
Damn it!

10:05.105 --> 10:07.138
Wind shear! Hold on!

10:09.008 --> 10:11.076
Marcus: Base, this is eagle!
Do you copy?

10:11.078 --> 10:13.378
Copy. Copy. We copy.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.347
Do you read?
Do you read?

10:15.349 --> 10:16.748
We have equipment fail...

10:16.750 --> 10:18.717
Wind's wreaking havoc
on the comms.

10:18.719 --> 10:21.219
Walter! Walter, do you copy?!

10:21.221 --> 10:23.922
(static crackling)

10:23.924 --> 10:25.323
We're gonna die!
No one's gonna die.

10:25.325 --> 10:26.958
(screaming)
marcus: Mayday!

10:26.960 --> 10:29.694
Base, this is eagle!
We are in distress!

10:29.696 --> 10:31.196
Repeat-- we are in distress!

10:31.198 --> 10:33.365
We're heading right
for those trees!

10:33.367 --> 10:34.699
Walter:
No, no, no, no, no!

10:34.701 --> 10:35.767
You steer away from the pines!

10:35.769 --> 10:37.035
Aim for that! The sheoak!

10:37.037 --> 10:39.070
It's softer!
We'll have a much better

10:39.072 --> 10:40.205
Chance of survival!

10:40.207 --> 10:42.674
Walter, 500 feet! 400 feet!

10:42.676 --> 10:44.209
You got to trust me!
Do it now! Do it now!

10:44.211 --> 10:46.311
Paige: Oh, my god! Oh!
Happy: Oh, my god.

10:48.080 --> 10:50.181
What the hell
are you doing?!

10:50.183 --> 10:52.050
Heads down! Heads down now!

10:52.052 --> 10:53.685
Everybody, hold on!
We're going in!

10:53.687 --> 10:54.986
(paige screams)

11:13.206 --> 11:15.073
My duodenum.

11:15.075 --> 11:16.875
Everyone all right?
Paige: I'm okay.

11:16.877 --> 11:17.776
Check.

11:17.778 --> 11:19.344
Terrified,
but breathing.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.312
(branches creaking)

11:21.314 --> 11:23.248
Happy:
Okay.

11:23.250 --> 11:27.352
Or the bow breaks
and this cradle falls.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.320
You okay, boss?

11:29.322 --> 11:30.922
Marcus:
I've been better.

11:30.924 --> 11:31.790
How bad?

11:31.792 --> 11:32.791
Uh, bright blood,

11:32.793 --> 11:34.159
Outer left side of the thigh.

11:34.161 --> 11:36.361
Looks like he nicked
the femoral artery,

11:36.363 --> 11:37.696
But it's clotted off,
stabilized.

11:37.698 --> 11:39.197
How would you
know that?

11:39.199 --> 11:40.765
If it hadn't,
you'd be dead.

11:40.767 --> 11:42.300
But that cut could expand.

11:42.302 --> 11:44.035
We need to leave the metal in.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.770
You do a tourniquet,
and I'll clean it up

11:45.772 --> 11:47.172
When we get on the ground.

11:47.174 --> 11:49.340
We need to get you
to a hospital asap.

11:49.342 --> 11:51.943
Great in theory, but we are
40-feet high in a tree.

11:51.945 --> 11:53.745
And our comms are dead.

11:53.747 --> 11:55.113
I doubt they got
a location on

11:55.115 --> 11:56.881
Our crash site.
I can take care of that,

11:56.883 --> 11:59.384
But I'm gonna need everyone
to cut off their seatbelts.

11:59.386 --> 12:00.485
Sly, I need you to do
some math for me.

12:00.487 --> 12:02.854
Okay, based on
the angle of the tree

12:02.856 --> 12:04.756
And the weight
distribution, uh,

12:04.758 --> 12:06.791
Estimated by the
barycenter balancing point,

12:06.793 --> 12:09.794
As well as the relatively
weak tensile strength of

12:09.796 --> 12:12.397
The river sheoak, which is
really no more than a weed...

12:12.399 --> 12:13.765
Focus.
Okay.

12:13.767 --> 12:15.366
Bottom line is we need to remove

12:15.368 --> 12:18.403
The weight strategically, or
we're all going to topple over--

12:18.405 --> 12:19.938
Like don't tip the waiter.

12:19.940 --> 12:22.941
So, best guess is happy,
then me, then toby,

12:22.943 --> 12:25.376
Then marcus needs to take
some weight off the nose,

12:25.378 --> 12:26.478
Then walter,

12:26.480 --> 12:28.313
And then lastly paige,

12:28.315 --> 12:30.815
Because the weight displacement
in the cabin is less.

12:30.817 --> 12:31.516
Walter:
Happy,

12:31.518 --> 12:32.851
Make it happen.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.121
(branches creak)
paige: Whoa!

12:36.123 --> 12:38.523
We're fine!

12:38.525 --> 12:40.191
Everything's fine.

12:46.332 --> 12:49.000
When I go down,
this thing is gonna shake.

12:49.002 --> 12:51.169
Just keep
your heads straight.

12:51.171 --> 12:52.771
We should be good.

12:52.773 --> 12:54.939
"should." fantastic.

13:02.381 --> 13:04.449
(metal groaning)

13:16.228 --> 13:17.896
Made it!

13:17.898 --> 13:19.497
You're up, sylvester!

13:19.499 --> 13:23.067
I think my calculations
were off, happy!

13:23.069 --> 13:25.069
I should go last!

13:25.071 --> 13:26.905
No, your calculations
were perfect,

13:26.907 --> 13:28.439
And this thing's not gonna
hold much longer, okay?

13:28.441 --> 13:29.507
So you go now.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.142
You're gonna be fine, sly.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.844
Okay.

13:32.846 --> 13:34.312
Think happy thoughts.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.080
Okay.

13:36.082 --> 13:38.149
Geez.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.552
Oh, my god.

13:41.353 --> 13:42.921
(groans)

13:42.923 --> 13:43.855
Come on! You can do it!

13:43.857 --> 13:46.291
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

13:46.293 --> 13:49.127
(muttering)

13:49.129 --> 13:51.596
Oh, my god. Oh, my god!

13:51.598 --> 13:52.964
I can't go any further!

13:52.966 --> 13:54.532
I can't... I can't go
any further!

13:54.534 --> 13:56.367
Just straighten your legs.

14:06.212 --> 14:07.312
Happy:
Hurry, guys!

14:07.314 --> 14:08.613
All this movement
is cracking

14:08.615 --> 14:09.914
The support branches!

14:09.916 --> 14:10.949
Okay, you're up.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.116
Sylvester said I go last.

14:12.118 --> 14:13.151
You're going. Now.
No.

14:13.153 --> 14:14.452
No, we should do...
We should do

14:14.454 --> 14:15.620
What sylvester said.
No, you go.

14:15.622 --> 14:17.322
Now. Go.

14:17.324 --> 14:18.356
Go!

14:18.358 --> 14:20.425
Oh, my god.

14:22.528 --> 14:24.062
Okay.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.868
That's the wrong order!
That is the wrong order!

14:31.871 --> 14:33.638
Hey, walt, you better hustle!

14:33.640 --> 14:37.242
Walter, you've got seconds until
that helicopter is in free fall!

14:37.244 --> 14:38.943
The support branches
are breaking!

14:41.413 --> 14:43.548
(branches crackling)

14:43.550 --> 14:44.983
Paige: Walter!
Sylvester: Walter! Walter!

14:45.651 --> 14:47.218
(all gasp)

14:48.187 --> 14:50.555
(panting)

14:52.358 --> 14:54.893
Uh...

14:54.895 --> 14:57.528
Looks as if things haven't
gone according to plan.

14:58.964 --> 15:00.331
Happy:
We call in our location

15:00.333 --> 15:03.301
On the sat phone,
cabe gets us, we regroup.

15:09.108 --> 15:13.111
We might not get the reception
we're looking for on this model.

15:21.253 --> 15:22.487
I have to tighten the tourniquet

15:22.489 --> 15:26.658
I think you and I have
different definitions of pain.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.428
Okay. So we're here.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.463
And with the tree cover,

15:32.465 --> 15:35.500
There's no way a chopper
can land or airlift us out.

15:35.502 --> 15:37.035
Only suitable
evac point is here.

15:37.037 --> 15:39.003
It's fiddler's basin;
it's due east.

15:42.341 --> 15:43.341
It's that way.

15:43.343 --> 15:45.076
How do you know that?

15:45.078 --> 15:47.045
I point the hour hand
at the sun, I bisect the angle

15:47.047 --> 15:49.080
Between the hand
and the 12 to find south.

15:49.082 --> 15:51.349
I know south,
I know every other direction.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.051
Walter:
Okay, so...

15:53.053 --> 15:54.585
We can't contact cabe,
but we have to assume

15:54.587 --> 15:58.690
And he knows that fiddler's
basin is our only shot.

15:58.692 --> 16:02.493
So, we follow the
hikers' footprints.

16:02.495 --> 16:06.364
We find them, and then we send
an overground rescue team back

16:06.366 --> 16:07.966
For sylvester
and the pilot.

16:07.968 --> 16:09.434
Oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

16:09.436 --> 16:10.601
You're leaving me here with him?
No way.

16:10.603 --> 16:12.570
You can't walk.
Toby has to come with us

16:12.572 --> 16:14.672
Just in case there are
any injured hikers.

16:14.674 --> 16:16.307
I do not like this plan.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.576
We're in desolate woods--
no food, limited water

16:18.578 --> 16:20.111
And no comms.
Right.

16:20.113 --> 16:22.313
Then you two can work on
getting a radio sorted

16:22.315 --> 16:24.082
While we're gone.

16:24.084 --> 16:26.551
Well, we're well aware
things would be easier

16:26.553 --> 16:30.355
If we still had that sat phone,
but that is not the case.

16:35.728 --> 16:37.695
What was with
the swipe at me?

16:37.697 --> 16:39.230
Well, if you had been
holding on

16:39.232 --> 16:40.598
To the sat phone
instead of me,

16:40.600 --> 16:42.166
We would never be
in this mess right now.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.602
I was protecting you.
It was instinctive.

16:44.604 --> 16:48.272
You were an unbuckled,
150-pound projectile.

16:48.274 --> 16:50.441
154-- I've been
working out.

16:50.443 --> 16:52.510
Walter:
Let's get moving!

16:52.512 --> 16:54.612
Sun sets in
47 minutes.

16:54.614 --> 16:58.516
Okay, so... I'll just stay here
in the middle of the woods

16:58.518 --> 16:59.684
With the grumpy guy.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.619
Hey, stop your bellyaching,

17:01.621 --> 17:03.688
Go fix that radio.

17:10.496 --> 17:12.096
Go on!

17:19.638 --> 17:20.738
Sir, we spotted
the chopper's tail

17:20.740 --> 17:22.106
Through a break
in the tree canopy.

17:22.108 --> 17:23.174
Cover's too thick.

17:23.176 --> 17:24.542
Can't make out any survivors.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.411
Show me a topo map!
Yes, sir.

17:26.413 --> 17:27.612
If they survive,
you think they'll try

17:27.614 --> 17:29.247
To keep with the mission?

17:29.249 --> 17:30.415
There's no "if."

17:30.417 --> 17:31.649
My guys survived.

17:33.385 --> 17:35.620
Here, fiddler's basin.

17:35.622 --> 17:37.455
Only viable evac point.

17:37.457 --> 17:39.590
Three miles from the crash site.
That's where we land.

17:39.592 --> 17:42.660
At 55 knots,
everything is grounded.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.262
Transport helo
can handle it.

17:44.264 --> 17:45.563
County doesn't
have one.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.498
Then I'm reaching out
to pendleton.

17:47.500 --> 17:50.701
There's no way I'm leaving
my guys down there!

17:52.538 --> 17:56.107
Hikers, we're here
to rescue you!

17:58.577 --> 18:00.578
Whoa, whoa.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.448
So, based on the prints,

18:03.450 --> 18:05.550
One of them
is favoring the right foot,

18:05.552 --> 18:07.518
Partly dragging the other;
they're probably injured.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.287
Yeah, that's a
size six shoe

18:09.289 --> 18:10.521
With a shallow depression.

18:10.523 --> 18:11.522
That's caitlin, the lightest.

18:11.524 --> 18:12.723
If she's hurt, they can't

18:12.725 --> 18:14.125
Be traveling that fast.

18:14.127 --> 18:15.827
We will find them.

18:15.829 --> 18:17.762
Oh, by the way,
uh, they really

18:17.764 --> 18:20.465
Stuck to that
cluster pattern you predicted.

18:20.467 --> 18:24.702
Most of my behavioral
predictions turn out to be true.

18:24.704 --> 18:28.239
For instance, what you did for
paige up in the copter. Huh?

18:28.241 --> 18:31.642
Letting her go first, putting
yourself at risk for her.

18:31.644 --> 18:34.545
I was not giving paige
special treatment.

18:34.547 --> 18:37.415
I watched you almost get
pancaked by a falling aircraft.

18:37.417 --> 18:39.317
You ignored sylvester's
calculations--

18:39.319 --> 18:41.652
Math and science-- so that
she could descend first.

18:41.654 --> 18:43.354
Can we focus
on finding the hikers?

18:43.356 --> 18:44.589
Of course.
Okay.

18:44.591 --> 18:46.357
May I have some of water?

18:46.359 --> 18:48.826
Oh, yeah.

18:48.828 --> 18:51.562
The... Agreed-upon ration.

18:51.564 --> 18:53.698
Same as
everyone else gets.

18:53.700 --> 18:54.799
We're all equal.

18:56.401 --> 18:57.602
Thank you.

19:00.706 --> 19:04.242
Wow, you really
learned me there, boss.

19:04.244 --> 19:05.910
You clearly
don't like her.

19:05.912 --> 19:08.479
Happy:
Guys, we got a problem!

19:08.481 --> 19:10.148
The trail ends here.

19:10.150 --> 19:11.682
The hikers crossed this field.

19:11.684 --> 19:14.185
They could've entered
up those woods at any point,

19:14.187 --> 19:16.587
We have no way
of finding them now.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.656
Wait, shh, shh, shh.

19:20.459 --> 19:21.659
Over there.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.494
How do you know?

19:23.496 --> 19:25.563
It's very scientific.
I heard them.

19:29.935 --> 19:32.537
Diego: These kids
can't go much further.

19:32.539 --> 19:34.338
Maybe we split--

19:34.340 --> 19:36.707
Increase the odds
of some of us getting rescued.

19:36.709 --> 19:37.775
Yeah, maybe.

19:37.777 --> 19:39.177
I don't know.

19:39.179 --> 19:41.245
I don't know
what to do.

19:41.247 --> 19:43.214
Hey.

19:43.949 --> 19:46.384
Heard you guys are lost.

19:46.386 --> 19:48.686
Oh, thank god.
Thank you!

19:48.688 --> 19:50.421
Okay. Okay.

19:50.423 --> 19:53.691
How come he always gets the hug?
I'm standing right next to him.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.660
Are you guys with
the forestry service?
Walter: No, no.

19:55.662 --> 19:57.762
We're here with the government;
we're here to bring you home.

19:57.764 --> 20:00.665
Well, we're gonna take you
to a nearby clearing;

20:00.667 --> 20:02.500
There are people
who will meet us there.

20:02.502 --> 20:03.668
Okay, let's go.
Toby, can you check

20:03.670 --> 20:05.369
On the girl
with the hurt leg?

20:05.371 --> 20:08.339
Let me get them some water.

20:08.341 --> 20:10.441
Okay, let's go, kid.

20:10.443 --> 20:11.809
What is this?

20:11.811 --> 20:12.810
I collect rocks.

20:12.812 --> 20:13.978
These have
boracite in them.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.646
I'm bringing them
home with me.

20:15.648 --> 20:17.515
Not anymore you're not.

20:17.517 --> 20:20.251
We're hiking for miles--
no extra weight.

20:22.688 --> 20:24.689
Okay, one rock.

20:24.691 --> 20:26.824
Okay, are we ready?

20:26.826 --> 20:28.759
Yeah?

20:28.761 --> 20:30.861
Okay, let's go.

20:32.698 --> 20:34.232
Toby?

20:35.000 --> 20:36.634
(both grunt)

20:44.643 --> 20:47.411
Okay, you need to strip
those input wires.

20:47.413 --> 20:48.813
I don't have any wire strippers.

20:48.815 --> 20:50.881
Just use your teeth
and your fingernails.

20:50.883 --> 20:52.950
This is incredibly unsanitary.

20:52.952 --> 20:54.919
Unsanitary? Really?

20:54.921 --> 20:56.520
I ate grubs and worms
for five days

20:56.522 --> 20:58.789
On a military exercise
when I was your age.

20:58.791 --> 21:01.926
Because I learned to do
what needs to be done.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.794
Operator (over radio):
Copy. Come in.
Oh, my god.

21:03.796 --> 21:04.795
Hello?

21:04.797 --> 21:07.732
Don't talk to me,
talk to them! Talk to them!

21:07.734 --> 21:09.267
(static crackling)

21:09.269 --> 21:10.434
Hello, do you
copy? Hello?

21:10.436 --> 21:11.636
Come in, please.

21:13.038 --> 21:14.872
Hello? Come
in, please.

21:14.874 --> 21:16.941
Come on, come
on, come on.

21:21.780 --> 21:23.481
I'm sorry.

21:30.822 --> 21:32.323
What?

21:32.325 --> 21:33.491
You're not gonna
say anything?

21:33.493 --> 21:34.959
I already said
I'm sorry.

21:34.961 --> 21:35.960
Okay.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.728
I get it. I get it.

21:37.730 --> 21:39.964
Maybe if I rewired
the entire radio

21:39.966 --> 21:41.999
With my mouth
full of beetle larvae,

21:42.001 --> 21:44.001
Maybe then I would have
done a better job for you.

21:44.003 --> 21:45.770
Kid, kid, look, look.

21:45.772 --> 21:47.838
Oh, no.

21:49.741 --> 21:51.075
Toby:
You smell smoke?

21:51.077 --> 21:52.610
Pete: There must be
a fire somewhere.

21:52.612 --> 21:53.744
Paige:
Is that an ember?

21:53.746 --> 21:55.746
Walter:
Whoa.

21:56.815 --> 21:58.349
Ah, that was close.

21:58.351 --> 21:59.684
Um, walter.

21:59.686 --> 22:00.885
Yeah?

22:07.759 --> 22:09.327
Oh, boy.

22:14.800 --> 22:17.601
You need to hurry up,
kid!
I'm well aware that a
forest fire can spread

22:17.603 --> 22:18.769
At 22 feet per second.

22:18.771 --> 22:20.104
Fire's circling
around us.

22:20.106 --> 22:21.839
That loop closes,
then we're cooked, literally.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.841
Okay, I just need to
secure one more seat belt.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.109
All right.

22:25.111 --> 22:26.744
And you're okay to lay
on this on your back?

22:26.746 --> 22:27.745
Of course I am.
Great.

22:27.747 --> 22:29.080
(groans)

22:29.082 --> 22:31.615
Hey, take my arm,
take my arm, okay?

22:31.617 --> 22:33.584
Your leg has a lot
more blood on it.

22:33.586 --> 22:35.052
Are you okay?
I'm fine, I'm fine.

22:35.054 --> 22:36.354
Just get me on there.

22:36.356 --> 22:37.588
Easy, easy.

22:37.590 --> 22:39.657
Strap yourself
in there.

22:40.959 --> 22:42.793
You sure this is gonna hold?

22:42.795 --> 22:44.762
It only needs to hold us
for three miles

22:44.764 --> 22:47.998
Your friends took the map.
You remember where it is?

22:48.000 --> 22:49.734
I have a photographic memory.

22:49.736 --> 22:51.135
Of course you do. Let's go!

22:51.137 --> 22:53.371
Let's go!

22:53.373 --> 22:54.705
(grunts)

22:54.707 --> 22:56.374
(coughs)
my eyes are burning.

22:56.376 --> 22:57.708
It's getting
hard to breathe.

22:57.710 --> 23:00.878
Okay, hold on.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.012
Will you grab that out?

23:02.014 --> 23:04.014
Grab that.

23:04.016 --> 23:07.618
Okay, now hold that up
to your nose and mouth.

23:09.020 --> 23:10.688
(people coughing)

23:12.624 --> 23:13.958
Here you go.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.860
Whoa, what the hell
are you doing?

23:15.862 --> 23:18.529
I'm helping you, like I was
trying to on the helicopter.

23:18.531 --> 23:20.131
That's all, just help.

23:20.133 --> 23:21.899
I do not need someone
to take care of me.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.401
Hey.

23:23.403 --> 23:24.869
You kissed me.

23:24.871 --> 23:26.771
And now that
I'm responding to that,

23:26.773 --> 23:28.105
You're scared
and shutting down.

23:28.107 --> 23:29.740
I am surrounded by fire.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.575
We have kids to save,
not to mention ourselves.

23:31.577 --> 23:33.077
Not the time.

23:35.680 --> 23:37.748
(coughing continues)

23:44.156 --> 23:45.089
What's up?

23:45.091 --> 23:46.791
See for yourself.

23:49.461 --> 23:51.495
Pete:
What now?

23:51.497 --> 23:53.130
There's got to
be a way around.

23:53.132 --> 23:57.001
We'd be moving laterally as
the fire proceeds in this way.

23:57.003 --> 23:58.135
If we pick the wrong
direction, then...

23:58.137 --> 23:59.537
We're dead.

23:59.539 --> 24:01.705
How long would
you say we have?

24:01.707 --> 24:03.040
We've got
about ten minutes.

24:03.042 --> 24:07.578
Start looking for long branches
strong enough to hold us.

24:07.580 --> 24:09.580
Maybe we, uh,
we bind them together,

24:09.582 --> 24:10.881
Then we reach across.

24:10.883 --> 24:12.716
Oh, bro, that sounds
like suicide.

24:12.718 --> 24:14.118
Staying here is suicide.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.020
Come on,
start looking.

24:16.022 --> 24:18.022
Pete: Walter, I'm sorry,
this is all my fault.

24:18.024 --> 24:19.657
You didn't start the wildfire.

24:19.659 --> 24:21.659
I took everyone off the
trail, got everyone lost,

24:21.661 --> 24:23.527
All because I wanted to
find the perfect spot

24:23.529 --> 24:24.762
For jenna, to
propose to her.

24:24.764 --> 24:26.130
And now she's gonna
die, everyone,

24:26.132 --> 24:27.498
Because of me.

24:27.500 --> 24:28.833
You want to undo that?

24:28.835 --> 24:30.501
Help us get over that ravine.

24:30.503 --> 24:32.169
All right?

24:32.171 --> 24:33.604
What's she doing?

24:39.911 --> 24:41.212
Any of you guys ever rope-swing?

24:44.182 --> 24:47.184
(coughing)

24:47.186 --> 24:49.119
I-I got to catch my breath.

24:49.121 --> 24:51.021
It's on account
of the smoke.

24:51.023 --> 24:52.857
You got to push
through it, kid,

24:52.859 --> 24:54.492
'cause I'm looking at a blaze
coming over that hill

24:54.494 --> 24:55.893
Right toward us.

24:57.829 --> 24:59.997
It's faster than I am.
I can't outrun it.

24:59.999 --> 25:01.765
Like hell you can't!

25:01.767 --> 25:03.968
Now get your ass
in gear now! Move!

25:03.970 --> 25:04.935
Don't yell at me.

25:04.937 --> 25:06.170
I'm about to burn to death!

25:06.172 --> 25:09.139
Now grow a pair, son,
and oscar mike now!

25:09.141 --> 25:10.875
Stop.

25:10.877 --> 25:14.278
Military talk and berating
won't work with me.

25:14.280 --> 25:15.980
It never has.

25:15.982 --> 25:17.982
I have done the calculations!

25:17.984 --> 25:20.050
My fastest rate of speed,
the decline angle of this hill,

25:20.052 --> 25:21.919
The pace of the fire,
the dryness of the underbrush--

25:21.921 --> 25:25.155
A gazelle would be
taken in minutes.

25:25.157 --> 25:27.157
You and I have seconds!

25:27.159 --> 25:31.829
Son, doing nothing isn't
an option for either of us.

25:31.831 --> 25:34.532
Listen to me.

25:34.534 --> 25:37.535
We got to figure a way
to move faster than this fire,

25:37.537 --> 25:39.236
Or we're both dead.

25:39.238 --> 25:41.772
Do you understand?

25:44.709 --> 25:47.077
We can't,
but we may not need to.

25:49.981 --> 25:52.182
Okay, at least the
hold is secure.

25:52.184 --> 25:54.818
Can't help but notice
you haven't swung out yet.

25:54.820 --> 25:56.153
Yeah, about that--

25:56.155 --> 25:57.888
This tree could totally
be rotted out inside.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.623
A person's weight
could snap it in half.

25:59.625 --> 26:01.759
Yeah, and fall 50 feet
to their death.
Yup.

26:01.761 --> 26:03.928
Jenna:
We've got to do something;
the fire's getting closer.

26:03.930 --> 26:05.563
Well, unless we got
a human guinea pig

26:05.565 --> 26:06.630
Who wants to test
this thing out...

26:06.632 --> 26:10.267
(walter yelling)

26:11.236 --> 26:13.070
Whoa.

26:15.006 --> 26:17.007
Yeah.

26:17.009 --> 26:18.809
It'll hold.

26:21.279 --> 26:23.280
(grunts)

26:23.282 --> 26:24.815
It's getting closer.

26:24.817 --> 26:26.817
We got to move faster.
I know, I know.

26:26.819 --> 26:27.851
Let's go!

26:27.853 --> 26:29.286
Okay. Here.

26:29.288 --> 26:30.921
Are you sure
about this?

26:30.923 --> 26:33.257
Yes. Back in here.
Watch your head.

26:33.259 --> 26:34.325
Thanks.

26:36.628 --> 26:38.996
Oh. Okay, okay.

26:43.335 --> 26:45.636
We're gonna be baked
alive in here.
No.

26:45.638 --> 26:48.105
The door's made of titanium;
it's a low conductor of heat.

26:48.107 --> 26:49.707
You better be
right, kid.

26:49.709 --> 26:50.708
Oh, my god!

26:50.710 --> 26:51.909
Get down!
Get down! Cover!

27:05.991 --> 27:06.957
(sylvester yells)

27:06.959 --> 27:09.026
(both coughing)

27:12.364 --> 27:14.698
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

27:14.700 --> 27:17.334
Careful with your leg.
Careful with your leg.

27:17.336 --> 27:18.902
Okay.

27:21.806 --> 27:23.207
You okay?

27:23.209 --> 27:24.942
Breathing.

27:24.944 --> 27:26.176
Barely.

27:26.178 --> 27:28.912
Oh, man, your leg's
losing a lot of blood.

27:28.914 --> 27:31.115
I have to tighten
your tourniquet.

27:31.117 --> 27:33.317
Do your worst.

27:36.254 --> 27:39.890
That should hold
it for a bit.

27:39.892 --> 27:41.158
Thanks.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.327
I got to hand it to you,
that was quick thinking

27:43.329 --> 27:44.995
With the pipe.

27:44.997 --> 27:46.296
We got to move.

27:46.298 --> 27:48.198
This door has been
warped by the heat.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.200
I think I can fix it.

27:50.202 --> 27:51.902
Hey, hey.

27:51.904 --> 27:54.004
Use this.

27:54.006 --> 27:55.372
Thank you.

27:57.308 --> 27:59.376
(grunting)

28:01.446 --> 28:03.681
So I take it your dad
was military?

28:03.683 --> 28:05.683
Very.

28:05.685 --> 28:07.818
You guys didn't
get along too well?

28:07.820 --> 28:11.088
Well, my father comes from a
world where a man is measured by

28:11.090 --> 28:13.190
How many tackles
he made in high school

28:13.192 --> 28:16.260
Or how many beer cans
he can crush against his skull.

28:18.229 --> 28:19.797
Same world that you come from.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.035
(coughs) okay, guys, about a
quarter mile, we dogleg right,

28:25.037 --> 28:26.870
Then it's a straight
shot from there.

28:26.872 --> 28:30.140
About, uh, 500 feet,
five percent grade.

28:30.142 --> 28:32.076
Okay, toby?

28:32.078 --> 28:34.478
Follow. Great.
Toby: Come on, guys, got to
make it to the clearing.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.914
Let's start rationing out the
water-- give us a little lift.

28:36.916 --> 28:38.348
You can take my share
if you want.

28:38.350 --> 28:40.184
No. You need
as much as anyone.

28:40.186 --> 28:45.222
Walter, get down here! The
basin's just around that bend.

28:45.224 --> 28:46.890
This is the only way through.

28:46.892 --> 28:48.492
Happy: This gully is
creating a funnel effect

28:48.494 --> 28:49.993
That's pulling
the fires together.

28:49.995 --> 28:51.161
We got to run.
Okay, okay.

28:51.163 --> 28:52.162
Come on. Come on, guys.

28:52.164 --> 28:54.164
You heard her.

28:58.503 --> 29:01.004
Come on!

29:02.941 --> 29:05.042
Hurry, the wall's closing!

29:07.045 --> 29:08.445
You're okay.
You're okay.

29:12.517 --> 29:13.317
Walter!

29:13.319 --> 29:15.819
Walter!

29:15.821 --> 29:17.221
Jimmy, you're okay!

29:17.223 --> 29:19.156
I'm fine, I'm fine.
You got to be careful.

29:19.158 --> 29:20.424
You don't want
to burn out.

29:20.426 --> 29:22.493
Too soon?

29:22.495 --> 29:25.362
Guys, the fire's gonna fill up
the clearing before we know it.

29:25.364 --> 29:28.232
We got to move.
Over there, come on!

29:29.300 --> 29:31.468
(grunting)

29:34.439 --> 29:36.473
Hold up! Wait.

29:36.475 --> 29:38.242
We're stuck.

29:38.244 --> 29:39.476
All right.

29:39.478 --> 29:40.477
(grunts loudly)

29:40.479 --> 29:42.546
Stop, stop, stop.

29:42.548 --> 29:45.249
This contraption of yours
isn't going anywhere.

29:45.251 --> 29:47.217
Okay.

29:47.219 --> 29:49.520
Give me a second.
Let me see if I can fix it.

29:49.522 --> 29:50.521
No, no.

29:50.523 --> 29:51.889
Stop. Just stop.

29:53.057 --> 29:54.858
Look, I'm dead weight.

29:54.860 --> 29:56.894
You're dead on your feet.
We're out of water.

29:56.896 --> 29:58.529
You're cramping up.

29:58.531 --> 30:00.264
At this rate,
we're not gonna go

30:00.266 --> 30:02.232
Another ten inches,
let alone another mile.

30:02.234 --> 30:04.568
I'm not going to abandon you.

30:04.570 --> 30:06.236
It's not your call.

30:06.238 --> 30:09.506
This gully is filling up
with smoke.

30:09.508 --> 30:12.209
There will not be
enough oxygen left.

30:12.211 --> 30:14.478
If I leave you, you will die.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.980
We both die if you stay.

30:24.489 --> 30:26.256
What are you doing?

30:26.258 --> 30:27.524
(grunting)

30:27.526 --> 30:30.260
I'm saving your life, son. Go!

30:31.429 --> 30:32.996
Go.

30:36.234 --> 30:38.068
We're coming up
on the crash site.

30:39.370 --> 30:41.371
Light it up!

30:48.380 --> 30:52.482
<i>Staying ahead of this fire,</i>
<i>even for smoke jumpers,</i>

30:52.484 --> 30:54.218
Would be damn near impossible.

30:57.055 --> 30:58.455
Take us to fiddler's basin.

30:58.457 --> 31:01.058
We'll be flying right
into the fire front.

31:01.060 --> 31:03.126
Visibility will be low to nil.

31:03.128 --> 31:05.429
I don't see any bodies
by the chopper.

31:05.431 --> 31:07.497
Now, my guys are survivors.

31:07.499 --> 31:09.099
Don't make me ask again.

31:09.101 --> 31:11.335
Let's head to the basin.

31:15.607 --> 31:16.874
(gasping)

31:16.876 --> 31:19.009
We can't make it to the basin.

31:19.011 --> 31:20.210
We can't go back.

31:20.212 --> 31:21.645
Oh, my god.
We're trapped.

31:21.647 --> 31:23.447
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

31:23.449 --> 31:24.514
Shh, shh.

31:24.516 --> 31:25.983
Listen. Listen.

31:25.985 --> 31:26.650
(helicopter approaching)

31:26.652 --> 31:28.252
A helicopter.

31:28.254 --> 31:29.553
It's cabe.

31:29.555 --> 31:31.555
Hey!

31:31.557 --> 31:33.323
They're never gonna see us
through the smoke.

31:33.325 --> 31:35.492
Flashlights. Flashlights!

31:35.494 --> 31:36.660
Hey!

31:36.662 --> 31:39.563
(all shouting)

31:39.565 --> 31:41.465
Commander:
I don't see anybody.

31:41.467 --> 31:42.900
You?
Not yet.

31:42.902 --> 31:45.135
That fire line
to the west

31:45.137 --> 31:48.238
Is cutting off any
route into that basin.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.439
Wherever they are,

31:49.441 --> 31:52.142
They are not making
it to the clearing.

31:52.144 --> 31:55.279
Sir, soot can
choke our engine.

31:55.281 --> 31:57.047
Respectfully,
there is no point

31:57.049 --> 31:59.049
In all of us dying.

31:59.051 --> 32:01.084
We need to go, sir.

32:09.060 --> 32:10.060
Hey!

32:10.062 --> 32:12.129
(groans)

32:13.598 --> 32:14.665
Come on!

32:22.006 --> 32:24.041
(coughing continues)

32:26.244 --> 32:28.078
Pete, pete, pete.
Her hand.

32:28.080 --> 32:30.180
Give me the ring that you
were gonna put on that hand.

32:30.182 --> 32:32.215
The engagement ring.
I need that diamond.

32:32.217 --> 32:33.116
Give me the diamond.

32:33.118 --> 32:34.251
Congratulations.

32:34.253 --> 32:36.153
Toby.

32:36.155 --> 32:37.654
(grunting)
what are you thinking?

32:39.958 --> 32:41.959
We need to create
a signal flare.

32:41.961 --> 32:43.160
And what is
the one element

32:43.162 --> 32:44.394
That we have
in spades around here?

32:44.396 --> 32:45.429
That would be fire.

32:45.431 --> 32:47.097
Exactly.
And thanks to jimmy,

32:47.099 --> 32:49.232
We have boron.

32:49.234 --> 32:51.234
Now, fires out there
are burning upwards

32:51.236 --> 32:53.036
Of 4,000 degrees.

32:53.038 --> 32:56.139
Boron melts at 3,700.

32:56.141 --> 32:57.240
You insured that, right?

32:57.242 --> 32:59.276
Boron also has
a deoxidizing effect...

33:00.445 --> 33:02.446
...On white gold,
all of which

33:02.448 --> 33:06.316
Combine to form
a green plume of smoke!

33:13.257 --> 33:15.559
(coughing continues)

33:15.561 --> 33:17.327
Walter:
Come on. Come on.

33:25.236 --> 33:27.170
There!

33:27.172 --> 33:28.605
Right there! A signal!

33:28.607 --> 33:30.374
Where?
Right there!
Green smoke!

33:30.376 --> 33:32.175
They're still alive!
Turn it around!

33:32.177 --> 33:33.477
Turn around!

33:33.479 --> 33:35.746
Douse those in water
and hold over your faces.

33:35.748 --> 33:37.481
This one's empty.

33:37.483 --> 33:40.283
So is my canteen.
Oh, we're losing the signal.

33:40.285 --> 33:41.385
Diego:
Oh, god, this is it.

33:41.387 --> 33:42.686
(coughing continues)

34:00.138 --> 34:01.805
(people coughing)

34:01.807 --> 34:04.074
Happy, I'm not
gonna apologize

34:04.076 --> 34:05.742
For what I did earlier,
'cause I wanted to protect you.

34:05.744 --> 34:07.677
By now, I figured
you'd know why,

34:07.679 --> 34:10.180
But in case you don't know,
I want my last words

34:10.182 --> 34:11.281
To have some meaning.

34:11.283 --> 34:12.649
So, happy quinn, I am in love...

34:14.719 --> 34:16.620
Perfect timing.

34:16.622 --> 34:18.055
Let's go! Let's go!

34:18.057 --> 34:18.822
Got our chopper 20 yards south!

34:18.824 --> 34:21.191
Where's sylvester?

34:21.193 --> 34:22.325
I thought he was with you.

34:22.327 --> 34:23.794
No, we left him
at the crash site.

34:23.796 --> 34:25.829
Crash site got burned over,
walter. Let's go.

34:25.831 --> 34:27.631
Come on. Let's go, son!

34:29.834 --> 34:31.301
We got to evac now!

34:31.303 --> 34:32.769
We have to wait
for sylvester.

34:32.771 --> 34:34.738
Fire's too close.

34:34.740 --> 34:36.273
We got to go!

34:36.275 --> 34:37.707
Not without our man!

34:37.709 --> 34:40.610
He thinks like us.
He will make it here.

34:40.612 --> 34:42.079
And I'm not gonna leave
without him.

34:42.081 --> 34:44.081
Commander: We can look
for him when we're back

34:44.083 --> 34:46.349
Up top again.
We need to go now, sir.

34:46.351 --> 34:48.418
Negative! Not an option!

34:56.694 --> 34:57.561
There! There! There! There!

34:57.563 --> 35:00.664
Put him down. Put him down.
It's okay, buddy.

35:09.640 --> 35:11.875
Toby, he's lost
a lot of blood.

35:13.811 --> 35:16.113
(helicopter whirring)

35:16.115 --> 35:17.681
Commander: All right,
let's move out!

35:28.159 --> 35:30.794
(quiet chatter)

35:35.500 --> 35:37.734
Sounds like they're getting
a handle on the fire.

35:37.736 --> 35:39.569
Should have it contained
by nightfall.

35:39.571 --> 35:43.540
Look, I know we've had some
close calls together, but...

35:43.542 --> 35:45.142
Today was extra dicey.

35:45.144 --> 35:46.409
Aw.

35:46.411 --> 35:47.811
You were worried about us.

35:47.813 --> 35:50.347
In so many words, yes.

35:50.349 --> 35:52.415
I'm glad you're all okay.

35:53.751 --> 35:55.685
Guys, we're
growing on him.

35:55.687 --> 35:58.922
Softy.

35:58.924 --> 36:00.857
Sylvester:
Hey. Hey.

36:00.859 --> 36:02.459
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

36:03.761 --> 36:05.595
Please be careful with him.

36:05.597 --> 36:06.796
Sylvester.

36:06.798 --> 36:08.198
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

36:08.200 --> 36:10.167
You're one tough
son of a bitch.

36:11.369 --> 36:13.703
I'd be proud as hell
to call you my kid.

36:16.674 --> 36:18.708
Paramedic:
Lift.

36:28.386 --> 36:31.488
(siren wailing)

36:37.862 --> 36:41.731
Uh, it's just costume jewelry,
but it should do the job.

36:47.872 --> 36:49.839
â™ª

36:54.879 --> 36:56.580
(talking quietly)

37:01.285 --> 37:03.353
â™ª

37:06.224 --> 37:07.657
(both laugh)

37:25.276 --> 37:27.277
Hey.

37:27.279 --> 37:29.312
Hey.

37:31.916 --> 37:34.584
Got pretty intense out there.

37:34.586 --> 37:36.886
Yeah. Big fire.

37:36.888 --> 37:39.856
I wasn't talking
about the fire.

37:41.859 --> 37:44.561
People say stupid things
in the heat of battle.

37:44.563 --> 37:45.962
Oh...

37:45.964 --> 37:47.664
No, I meant it.

37:47.666 --> 37:49.933
I chose in the moment
to live honestly,

37:49.935 --> 37:51.801
And if you don't feel
the same way yet,

37:51.803 --> 37:53.603
I'm okay with it.

37:53.605 --> 37:55.772
You're confident.
On this I am.

37:55.774 --> 37:57.941
I'm confident enough
to make another wager.

37:57.943 --> 38:02.279
If I win, you take
me to dinner.

38:03.481 --> 38:04.481
And if I win?

38:04.483 --> 38:06.516
I take you.

38:06.518 --> 38:09.953
â™ª

38:20.966 --> 38:24.934
Walter: It's something
that toby's been working on.

38:24.936 --> 38:26.469
I got to give the kid more work

38:26.471 --> 38:28.305
If he's got time
to draw cartoons.

38:28.307 --> 38:29.639
(chuckles)

38:29.641 --> 38:30.974
Hell of a day.

38:30.976 --> 38:32.776
Ridiculous
if you think about it.

38:32.778 --> 38:35.445
One man's belief
in romantic love

38:35.447 --> 38:38.948
Destroys a helicopter,
400 acres of forest,

38:38.950 --> 38:42.385
Nearly kills a dozen people.

38:42.387 --> 38:44.921
Heart wants
what the heart wants.

38:45.923 --> 38:48.758
Heart is a circulatory muscle.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.894
Nothing more.

38:50.896 --> 38:54.364
Spoken like someone
who's never been in love.

38:54.366 --> 38:58.335
Hope that changes
for you one day, pal.

38:58.337 --> 39:00.403
Take care, walter.

39:03.374 --> 39:06.376
Ugh, it's cinnamon.
It's awful.
