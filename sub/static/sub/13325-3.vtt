WEBVTT

00:01.735 --> 00:03.369
So, ed, when did the fight
with your wife start?

00:05.305 --> 00:08.007
1972.

00:08.009 --> 00:11.243
No, no. I meant the fight
that caused all of that.

00:11.245 --> 00:14.079
Oh, yesterday.

00:14.081 --> 00:18.083
She used my razor
on her sasquatch legs again.

00:18.085 --> 00:21.020
It gets the blade
all catawampus

00:21.022 --> 00:22.454
And it cuts my face.

00:22.456 --> 00:23.756
What the hell
is catawampus?

00:23.758 --> 00:26.392
My mom's boobs.

00:26.394 --> 00:29.628
That's why you should never
use groupon to find
a plastic surgeon.

00:30.764 --> 00:34.266
Anyway, we got in this
big old fight

00:34.268 --> 00:37.436
And then she said
she wanted to leave me
and then we got drunk

00:37.438 --> 00:39.605
And then we had
makeup sex

00:39.607 --> 00:43.242
In my neighbor's
rosebushes.

00:43.244 --> 00:45.477
And that's how
all this happened.

00:45.479 --> 00:49.348
Well, shame on me
for asking.

00:49.350 --> 00:51.083
But the positive part
of ed's story

00:51.085 --> 00:52.518
Is that when you know
your partner well enough,

00:52.520 --> 00:55.621
You can resolve things
and not go to bed angry.

00:55.623 --> 00:58.657
I fight so dirty,
I've never actually had
makeup sex.

00:58.659 --> 01:01.193
It usually violates
the restraining order.

01:02.195 --> 01:04.096
I love makeup sex.

01:04.098 --> 01:06.098
Especially with katy perry.

01:06.100 --> 01:08.267
I make up sex with her
all the time.

01:09.502 --> 01:11.570
I'm so lonely.

01:13.540 --> 01:17.076
Oh, I'm sorry
to interrupt, charlie.

01:17.078 --> 01:19.378
I know I'm early
for our, uh,

01:19.380 --> 01:21.713
Research paper discussion.

01:21.715 --> 01:23.849
I'll go grab
a cup of coffee.

01:24.784 --> 01:27.786
- As you were.
- No problem, dr. Wales.

01:27.788 --> 01:30.089
You may find this
kind of interesting.

01:30.091 --> 01:31.757
<i>We were just saying</i>
<i>that a history with someone,</i>

01:31.759 --> 01:35.127
Say a long-term friendship,
is a key factor

01:35.129 --> 01:37.830
To having a successful
romantic relationship.

01:37.832 --> 01:39.665
If that's what
you're looking for.

01:39.667 --> 01:42.768
Oh, I'm sorry.
No one asked for my opinion.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.703
Sorry,
I was only talking about

01:44.705 --> 01:47.239
What emotionally healthy
people might want,

01:47.241 --> 01:49.108
Which is a committed
relationship.

01:49.110 --> 01:50.876
Excuse me.

01:50.878 --> 01:54.546
Emotionally-healthy people
also value their independence

01:54.548 --> 01:57.416
<i>And, as any</i>
<i>evolutionary biologist</i>
<i>would tell you,</i>

01:57.418 --> 01:59.551
Monogamy is
completely unsustainable.

01:59.553 --> 02:02.121
Oh, yeah?
What about the swans?

02:02.123 --> 02:03.789
Or the malagasy giant rat?

02:03.791 --> 02:06.291
Have you ever seen
those rats?

02:06.293 --> 02:08.894
They don't have
a lot of choices.

02:08.896 --> 02:12.264
Yeah, but the swans
are smoking hot.

02:12.266 --> 02:14.800
They can get all the swan tail
they want, but they don't.

02:16.336 --> 02:18.137
Great session,
everybody.

02:18.139 --> 02:20.205
Don't read anything
into this.

02:22.709 --> 02:25.244
- I thought we were
making progress.
- Progress with what?

02:25.246 --> 02:27.312
With our nonemotional,

02:27.314 --> 02:29.481
Anticommitment,
purely sexual
relationship.

02:29.483 --> 02:30.916
And that progress
would be?

02:30.918 --> 02:32.885
I thought we were now
in a quasi-emotional,

02:32.887 --> 02:36.421
Commitment-neutral,
mostly sexual
relationship.

02:36.423 --> 02:39.625
Maybe we are, but you
don't have to rub my nose
in it in front of your group.

02:39.627 --> 02:40.893
They didn't know what
we were talking about.

02:40.895 --> 02:42.427
It doesn't matter.

02:42.429 --> 02:45.797
We did and I am not moving
any further than that.

02:45.799 --> 02:47.799
A relationship
is like a shark.

02:47.801 --> 02:50.335
If you get too close,
it will kill you.

02:51.738 --> 02:53.539
You know, I think something
really bad happened to you

02:53.541 --> 02:55.174
When you were a kid.

02:55.176 --> 02:57.176
And then as an adult.

02:57.178 --> 02:59.945
And then right before
you walked in this kitchen.

03:08.922 --> 03:11.190
Yeah, sure.

03:14.761 --> 03:17.696
- Charlie?
- Hope?

03:17.698 --> 03:21.366
- Uh-huh. Hi.
- Wow.

03:21.368 --> 03:24.937
- How long has
it been since therapy?
- Almost five years.

03:24.939 --> 03:27.339
Oh, you look great.
You look happy.

03:27.341 --> 03:29.775
Are you still,
you know, dancing?

03:29.777 --> 03:32.844
You can say it.
Stripping.

03:32.846 --> 03:34.813
- And, no.
- That's great.
That's great.

03:34.815 --> 03:37.549
You really turned things
around when you stopped
being an angry stripper.

03:37.551 --> 03:41.286
Oh, yeah.
I made way more money
as a happy stripper.

03:41.288 --> 03:44.690
Cool.
A novelty act.

03:44.692 --> 03:46.825
And then I quit
and used the money

03:46.827 --> 03:49.461
To open a chain of
tattoo-removal shops

03:49.463 --> 03:52.464
Called
tramps without stamps.

03:52.466 --> 03:55.334
Well, you are
definitely climbing
the pole of success.

03:55.336 --> 03:57.836
- Uh-huh.
- Please.

03:59.439 --> 04:02.608
I'm-- I'm so sorry
that we didn't keep
in touch after therapy.

04:02.610 --> 04:05.777
Yeah, well, I didn't know
if it was cool.

04:05.779 --> 04:08.680
I mean, you make a connection
with your therapist

04:08.682 --> 04:10.916
And you don't know
if it's real

04:10.918 --> 04:12.718
Or it's because
you're slipping

04:12.720 --> 04:15.654
200 bucks a session
into their g-string.

04:15.656 --> 04:18.257
No, no.
What we had was real.

04:18.259 --> 04:20.859
I remember that one time
we bumped into each other
in that bar.

04:20.861 --> 04:23.562
I wouldn't have sat
there telling you about
my divorce

04:23.564 --> 04:26.431
Till 3:00 in the morning
if we didn't have some kind
of connection.

04:26.433 --> 04:29.301
Yeah.

04:29.303 --> 04:31.536
So, you still single?

04:31.538 --> 04:34.539
So I've been told
repeatedly.

04:36.376 --> 04:38.877
Well, I have
a confession.

04:38.879 --> 04:42.014
I left my copy of
"eat pray love"
at your house

04:42.016 --> 04:45.050
After my last session
and I always sort of hoped

04:45.052 --> 04:47.519
You'd find it
and give me a call.

04:47.521 --> 04:49.955
I should have known
that was yours from
the bookmark.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.391
It was a crumpled 20
covered with glitter.

04:52.393 --> 04:55.661
You know, I haven't been
in a strip club for two years

04:55.663 --> 04:58.897
And I still find glitter
in the weirdest places.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.866
That is so funny.
So do I.

05:02.735 --> 05:04.803
You know, I really
have to get going,

05:04.805 --> 05:07.706
But I would love
to get together
and catch up more.

05:07.708 --> 05:10.742
- How about Wednesday?
- You got it.

05:10.744 --> 05:12.811
Oh, before you go.

05:12.813 --> 05:15.781
I'm doing a little survey.
Finish this sentence for me.

05:15.783 --> 05:17.816
A relationship
is like a shark because...

05:17.818 --> 05:21.720
Because they're both
awesome in hawaii.

05:21.722 --> 05:23.055
( chuckles )

05:23.057 --> 05:25.524
How about Tuesday?

05:25.526 --> 05:27.592
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

05:31.831 --> 05:34.966
I know this sounds crazy,
but I had a huge crush

05:34.968 --> 05:36.768
On hope when she was
in my therapy group.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.970
But I was a complete
professional and I put
those feelings aside.

05:38.972 --> 05:40.806
I don't think it's crazy.

05:40.808 --> 05:43.408
It's a plot from a bad porno,
but not crazy.

05:43.410 --> 05:45.577
I think I might have
a future with her.

05:45.579 --> 05:48.046
There's the crazy part.
I knew you'd get there.

05:49.015 --> 05:51.883
You do realize that
the american psychological

05:51.885 --> 05:53.785
Association has a guideline
that you have to wait

05:53.787 --> 05:56.021
At least five years before
you date an ex-patient?

05:56.023 --> 05:59.424
I checked my notes.
It's been four years,
six months, and seven days.

05:59.426 --> 06:01.893
Did you check your notes
or were you checking the marks

06:01.895 --> 06:04.429
You scratched on the wall
with a nail?

06:04.431 --> 06:05.997
But this five-year thing--

06:05.999 --> 06:07.799
I mean, there's some wiggle
room there, don't you think?

06:07.801 --> 06:09.901
Like the expiration date
on milk.

06:09.903 --> 06:13.138
If you don't follow
the guidelines, you could have
your license taken away.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.807
So I'll be friends
with hope for six months,
then everything's fine.

06:15.809 --> 06:19.811
You'll chug that expired milk
straight from the carton.

06:19.813 --> 06:23.048
You can't be friends
with a woman without
sleeping with her.

06:23.050 --> 06:26.685
Hey, you and I were friends
for eight years before
we started chugging.

06:26.687 --> 06:30.589
Because I had self-control
and you had a wife.

06:30.591 --> 06:32.958
Okay,
therapy session time-out.

06:35.061 --> 06:38.630
- You're my friend, right?
- Yes, I am your friend.

06:39.699 --> 06:42.467
Thank you, siri.

06:42.469 --> 06:43.802
And you want me
to be happy, right?

06:43.804 --> 06:46.671
Within reason.

06:46.673 --> 06:48.807
And you don't want any type
of committed relationship.

06:48.809 --> 06:51.109
- Nope.
- Well, then why shouldn't
I take a shot at hope?

06:51.111 --> 06:53.712
- We have history.
- Because you're an idiot.
Time-in.

06:53.714 --> 06:56.181
As your therapist,
I'm concerned about
your career.

06:56.183 --> 06:57.983
When's the next time
you're gonna see hope?

06:57.985 --> 07:00.986
Tomorrow.
Time-out.

07:00.988 --> 07:02.854
We're going to trivia night
at the merry peasant.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.823
You could've said that
within the context
of the session.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.958
I got confused.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.795
All right, slugger.
How about I grab a date,
swing by,

07:09.797 --> 07:13.098
- And make sure everything
stays aboveboard?
- Sounds good.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.167
So my therapist,
who I'm secretly
having sex with,

07:15.169 --> 07:17.702
Is bringing a clueless date
to meet my former patient

07:17.704 --> 07:19.771
Who doesn't know
that I'm secretly
attracted to her.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.541
Yup, everything's
aboveboard.

07:23.843 --> 07:26.912
I must warn you,
I am pretty good
at bar trivia.

07:26.914 --> 07:29.181
Especially sports
and entertainment.

07:29.183 --> 07:31.149
Well, I am great
on geography.

07:31.151 --> 07:34.753
I stripped my way
across six continents.

07:34.755 --> 07:37.889
Wow, you're like a hot
"dora the explorer."

07:37.891 --> 07:40.158
Gracias, carlos.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.527
You know,
I've been wondering

07:42.529 --> 07:45.897
What happens when someone
becomes an ex-patient?

07:45.899 --> 07:48.867
Is there some sort of
grace period

07:48.869 --> 07:51.002
Before you're allowed to
hit it?

07:51.004 --> 07:54.773
You mean some
relationship purgatory

07:54.775 --> 07:57.476
Where the therapist
is stuck waiting
and waiting--

07:57.478 --> 07:59.811
Just counting the days
to pounce?

07:59.813 --> 08:01.646
That is unsavory.

08:01.648 --> 08:05.016
- Kate, hi.
- Charlie, hi.

08:05.018 --> 08:08.520
Hi. I'm kate wales.
This is tom.

08:08.522 --> 08:11.656
- Oh, my god.
- Oh.

08:11.658 --> 08:13.725
Well, you two
know each other.

08:13.727 --> 08:15.927
Yes. Oh, this is
so weird.

08:15.929 --> 08:18.230
Tom was my
therapist, too.

08:18.232 --> 08:20.065
Yeah, but that was almost
five years ago.

08:20.067 --> 08:22.734
You know,
you look incredible.

08:22.736 --> 08:24.936
As does kate.
Your date.

08:24.938 --> 08:27.138
No, no.
This is sweet.

08:27.140 --> 08:29.574
Hope's obviously excited
to see her

08:29.576 --> 08:32.744
Second therapist.

08:32.746 --> 08:34.646
Charlie was my
anger therapist

08:34.648 --> 08:37.716
At the same time
I was seeing tom
for my phobias.

08:37.718 --> 08:39.885
But I never thought
you guys would meet.

08:39.887 --> 08:43.054
Yeah, the phobia guys
are a little scared
of the anger guys.

08:43.056 --> 08:45.957
And between you and me,
that really pisses us off.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.661
It's a little embarrassing
having two people

08:49.663 --> 08:52.631
At the same table
who know all my secrets.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.766
I feel kind of naked.

08:54.768 --> 08:58.103
Oh, no.
There's no shame
in being vulnerable.

08:58.105 --> 09:00.238
Or naked.

09:00.240 --> 09:03.108
Or inappropriate,
apparently.

09:03.110 --> 09:06.845
Well, I'm gonna run
to the ladies' room
before the game starts.

09:06.847 --> 09:08.914
- Be right back.
- Okay.

09:12.752 --> 09:14.920
Really?

09:14.922 --> 09:16.621
So, tom.

09:16.623 --> 09:18.890
When was the last time
you saw hope professionally?

09:18.892 --> 09:20.926
Oh, geez. Four years,
eight months ago.

09:20.928 --> 09:23.595
I never thought
I'd see her again
and then here she is.

09:23.597 --> 09:25.163
Four months before
the deadline.

09:25.165 --> 09:27.899
Oh, this is fate.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.235
Someone up there wants me
to bag it and tag it.

09:31.671 --> 09:34.205
- What did you just say?
- Oh, please.

09:34.207 --> 09:36.908
I knew this night
would be a disaster
when you opened the door

09:36.910 --> 09:39.811
With that sour expression
and the wool turtleneck.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.914
So you're actually
counting down the days

09:42.916 --> 09:45.817
Until you can prey
on the affections of
a former patient?

09:45.819 --> 09:48.954
- I should call
the ethics board on you.
- Oh, and say what?

09:48.956 --> 09:52.157
I'm guilty of nothing
except having a heart
and a soul.

09:52.159 --> 09:55.193
I'll hide my intentions
until it's appropriate
to tell her.

09:56.896 --> 09:58.863
About two months
before you do.

09:58.865 --> 10:02.167
- Excuse me?
- That-- that is a mouth
full of voodoo.

10:02.169 --> 10:04.703
I will play trivia
with you, sir,

10:04.705 --> 10:06.771
But you are a friend
to no one at this table.

10:13.279 --> 10:16.281
Hey, charlie.
Sam left her flash drive here.
We'll be out in a second.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.849
Oh, my god.
What are you doing?

10:17.851 --> 10:19.618
Why are you
lighting candles
in the house?

10:19.620 --> 10:22.754
It's aromatherapy, sam.
It helps me relax.

10:22.756 --> 10:25.256
It's an open flame
with only wax to keep it

10:25.258 --> 10:27.692
From setting fire
to everything
in the house.

10:27.694 --> 10:29.761
Yeah, it's a candle.

10:30.863 --> 10:33.031
What do you think people did
before electricity?

10:33.033 --> 10:35.634
Died in fires.

10:38.804 --> 10:41.706
Okay,
so who is she?

10:41.708 --> 10:44.743
Her name is hope.
She's an ex-patient.

10:44.745 --> 10:46.311
She's coming by to pick up
a book and this is
the first chance

10:46.313 --> 10:50.749
You're allowed to date
your ex-patients?
That's creepy.

10:50.751 --> 10:52.817
Well, it's only creepy
for the first five years.

10:52.819 --> 10:56.221
In about six months
it gets upgraded to awesome.

10:56.223 --> 10:58.790
You better be careful,
charlie.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.692
You don't wanna
jeopardize your job.

11:00.694 --> 11:02.894
I won't.
She's just coming by
to pick up a book.

11:02.896 --> 11:05.830
What's with the candles?

11:05.832 --> 11:07.666
Hey, abraham lincoln
lit candles

11:07.668 --> 11:10.168
And he didn't bang everybody
that walked into his cabin.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.904
I'm serious.
I've been there.

11:12.906 --> 11:14.105
When I was a teenager,

11:14.107 --> 11:16.174
I lost a job for
"fraternizing" at work.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.276
We weren't even
fraternizing-fraternizing.

11:18.278 --> 11:20.378
We were just
dry fraternizing.

11:21.882 --> 11:27.352
- <i>( doorbell rings )</i>
<i>- I just wanna get one</i>
<i>last look before it's gone.</i>

11:27.354 --> 11:29.254
We used to put
the christmas tree
right over there.

11:29.256 --> 11:30.922
Sam, please.

11:30.924 --> 11:33.058
They're just candles.
Your dad will put them out.

11:33.060 --> 11:37.062
Don't forget to put them out.
Text me when they're out.

11:41.333 --> 11:42.901
Hey, hope.

11:42.903 --> 11:45.437
Hey, hope you're
not staying.

11:45.439 --> 11:48.339
- Charlie, this is my friend.
- Dr. Leslie moore.

11:48.341 --> 11:50.208
I used to be
hope's psychiatrist.
Good to meet you.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.777
Psychiatrist?

11:52.779 --> 11:54.813
You didn't mention
you had another shrink

11:54.815 --> 11:56.848
Other than the other shrink
you didn't mention.

11:56.850 --> 11:59.984
Oh, I didn't do therapy
with hope, per se.

11:59.986 --> 12:02.854
I was her
psychopharmacologist.

12:02.856 --> 12:05.423
I prescribed
her medication.

12:05.425 --> 12:08.760
I know what
a psychopharmacologist is.

12:08.762 --> 12:11.062
We bumped into
each other

12:11.064 --> 12:12.797
About a month ago
at the gym.

12:12.799 --> 12:16.334
I hope you don't mind,
but he insisted on coming
to meet you.

12:16.336 --> 12:19.504
Big baseball fan.

12:19.506 --> 12:21.973
- I'm gonna go get
some glasses, okay?
- Okay.

12:23.242 --> 12:25.009
Uh, please.

12:26.846 --> 12:29.914
- So you're a big
baseball fan, huh?
- Yeah, love baseball.

12:29.916 --> 12:32.283
Second base,
the gloves...
All of it.

12:33.786 --> 12:36.187
I bet you love it
when the catcher

12:36.189 --> 12:39.824
Blocks home plate
so the other guy
can't score.

12:39.826 --> 12:42.527
I just enjoy
the competition.

12:45.798 --> 12:47.866
I see.

12:47.868 --> 12:50.969
So how long have you been
hope's glorified drug dealer?

12:50.971 --> 12:52.971
I'm partially joking,
of course.

12:52.973 --> 12:55.106
Well, I haven't written
hope a prescription

12:55.108 --> 12:57.942
In almost five years.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.778
How long would you say
it is exactly?

12:59.780 --> 13:01.379
Well, let's see.

13:01.381 --> 13:03.982
November was zoloft.
30 days hath celexa,

13:03.984 --> 13:07.952
All the rest have 31--
four years and 11 months.

13:07.954 --> 13:10.955
This won't make
any sense to you,
but you're in the lead.

13:12.892 --> 13:14.859
Oh, and before I forget.

13:14.861 --> 13:18.496
I'm having a little birthday
get-together Saturday
at the merry peasant.

13:18.498 --> 13:21.332
Charlie,
you have to come.

13:21.334 --> 13:23.434
Leslie set up
a whole karaoke night

13:23.436 --> 13:26.070
Because he knows
I love it.

13:26.072 --> 13:28.139
Yes,
that's right,
charlie.

13:28.141 --> 13:31.142
I actually listened
when she talked.

13:31.144 --> 13:34.179
I'm a listener.

13:34.181 --> 13:36.080
She paid you
to listen.

13:36.082 --> 13:39.117
Well, sometimes
I listened for free.

13:39.119 --> 13:42.287
- Right, hope.
- Oh, you psycho...

13:42.289 --> 13:44.055
Pharmacologist.

13:48.928 --> 13:52.130
Oh, leslie,
which is sometimes
a man's name.

13:54.033 --> 13:57.435
Here we go.
One copy of
"eat pray love."

13:57.437 --> 14:00.271
Took five years,
but it finally got us
back together.

14:00.273 --> 14:04.008
How ironic.
I'm the one who actually
gave her this book.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.610
It's quite a read.

14:05.612 --> 14:07.478
The eating,
the praying...

14:07.480 --> 14:09.013
All of it.

14:09.015 --> 14:11.916
Must have meant a lot to her
'cause she left it here.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.954
So are all of
your ex-therapists

14:15.956 --> 14:18.022
Coming to this
karaoke thing?

14:18.024 --> 14:21.593
Of course.
You guys are awesome.

14:21.595 --> 14:24.929
I can't believe
you're all single.

14:24.931 --> 14:27.565
Really?
You can't believe
leslie's single?

14:27.567 --> 14:29.901
The hair, the face...
All of it.

14:33.339 --> 14:36.574
All right, let's check in
and see how you guys did
with your lima bean plants.

14:36.576 --> 14:38.910
- Wayne, where's yours?
- I killed it.

14:38.912 --> 14:41.112
Why would you do that?

14:41.114 --> 14:42.981
Well, it was taking
too long.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.549
I got things to do.

14:44.551 --> 14:47.385
I decided to become
a manager of a boy band

14:47.387 --> 14:49.087
Without them knowing it.

14:49.089 --> 14:51.356
Well, that's--
that's very ambitious,

14:51.358 --> 14:54.926
But this experiment
was about learning
the value of patience.

14:54.928 --> 14:57.929
Oh, you didn't need
to give us a bean plant
to teach us patience.

14:57.931 --> 14:59.964
You could have just said,
"ooh, you in jail."

15:01.400 --> 15:05.069
Charlie's saying
how good things come
to those who wait.

15:06.305 --> 15:07.972
Like this guy
I wanna shank.

15:07.974 --> 15:11.376
However, delaying it
till he's outta solitary

15:11.378 --> 15:14.112
Will make it all
the more gratifying,

15:14.114 --> 15:16.247
Shankwise.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.349
Really close, donovan,
really close.

15:18.351 --> 15:21.119
But I think you're confusing
delayed gratification

15:21.121 --> 15:22.654
With lying in wait.

15:22.656 --> 15:25.924
Besides,
you're not killing anybody.
We're sticking to the plan.

15:25.926 --> 15:28.927
We serve our time,
we get out, and we open
our antique shop...

15:28.929 --> 15:32.063
Both:
...In akron.

15:32.065 --> 15:34.065
What-- what cleo just said

15:34.067 --> 15:36.634
Is a great example
of delayed gratification.

15:36.636 --> 15:38.536
I can't delay
my gratification.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.638
Our showers
aren't that long.

15:40.640 --> 15:44.175
I'm talking about
relationships.

15:44.177 --> 15:46.311
As a matter of fact,
I'm dealing with my own

15:46.313 --> 15:48.313
Delayed
gratification issues.

15:48.315 --> 15:49.714
I knew it.

15:49.716 --> 15:51.950
There's some hot piece
you wanna tap,

15:51.952 --> 15:54.018
But you gotta wait for it.

15:55.220 --> 15:56.955
You know,
ernesto...

15:56.957 --> 15:58.957
Yes.

16:00.426 --> 16:02.961
Well, if you want it,
don't wait too long.

16:02.963 --> 16:05.563
Somebody else
is gonna bone it

16:05.565 --> 16:07.665
And own it.

16:07.667 --> 16:11.302
Actually, I'm more worried
that someone's gonna rent it
and dent it.

16:11.304 --> 16:14.572
But I gotta do something.
I just don't wanna hurt
my career.

16:14.574 --> 16:17.608
Charlie,
love is more important
than any career.

16:17.610 --> 16:21.245
And I say that
as a successful manager
of boy bands.

16:23.148 --> 16:26.284
Now, in all my years
of home invasion, no one
ever said to me,

16:26.286 --> 16:29.354
"please, don't
shoot me, mister.
I got work tomorrow."

16:29.356 --> 16:31.622
It's always,
"I got a wife and kids."

16:31.624 --> 16:34.192
Makes you reassess
what's important in life.

16:35.728 --> 16:37.662
Words of wisdom, wayne.

16:37.664 --> 16:41.733
Terrifying, disturbing,
unmedicated words of wisdom.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.341
- Hey, tom, leslie.
- Hey.

16:50.343 --> 16:51.743
You guys ready
to karaoke?

16:51.745 --> 16:54.245
By the way,
"the girl is mine,"
is mine.

16:54.247 --> 16:57.382
Dr. Rita
freudenberger, md,

16:57.384 --> 17:00.218
- Phd.
- Oh, for the love of god.

17:00.220 --> 17:03.087
I was hope's
feminist therapist.

17:03.089 --> 17:06.024
My practice combines
traditional talk therapy

17:06.026 --> 17:09.227
With a radical methodological
approach to psychology

17:09.229 --> 17:12.764
That questions
patriarchal assumptions.

17:12.766 --> 17:14.732
I want her so much.

17:14.734 --> 17:16.701
I have a proposal.

17:16.703 --> 17:19.570
As psychologists,
we're all familiar
with platt's concept

17:19.572 --> 17:21.806
Of the social trap
where individuals
acting selfishly

17:21.808 --> 17:24.742
Harm the group as a whole,
so I suggest we suspend
our campaigns

17:24.744 --> 17:27.345
Just for tonight
and celebrate hope's
birthday with dignity.

17:27.347 --> 17:29.814
- Fine.
- Fine.

17:29.816 --> 17:32.183
I'm too drunk
to get it up anyway.

17:32.185 --> 17:34.185
That's the kind of dignity
I'm looking for.

17:34.187 --> 17:36.487
First round's on me.

17:36.489 --> 17:39.624
Can we get a pitcher
of margaritas, please?

17:39.626 --> 17:42.193
Did you get the flowers
and the plane tickets to maui?

17:42.195 --> 17:44.662
I gotta say,
I'm impressed,
charlie.

17:44.664 --> 17:46.597
This is a pretty
bold move.

17:46.599 --> 17:48.599
Throwing a hail mary
here, brett.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.635
I'm breaking all the rules,
but if I don't seal
the deal tonight,

17:50.637 --> 17:53.538
She could wind up
with one of these bozos.

17:53.540 --> 17:55.473
You know, I think
this is the most
romantic thing

17:55.475 --> 17:57.375
That's ever happened
in this bar.

17:57.377 --> 18:00.778
Except for things
that have happened
on this bar.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.313
I wouldn't tell
the health inspector.

18:02.315 --> 18:04.315
It was with
the health inspector.

18:04.317 --> 18:06.651
How do you think
we got a "b"?

18:06.653 --> 18:08.719
Thanks.

18:11.290 --> 18:13.191
Here we go,
everybody.

18:15.260 --> 18:17.695
- Hi, everybody.
- Hey, the birthday
girl's here.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.831
- I'd like to propose a toast.
- I'm sorry, charlie,

18:19.833 --> 18:21.833
But something
really important
just happened

18:21.835 --> 18:24.335
- That I have to tell
you all about.
- Okay, okay.

18:24.337 --> 18:25.837
Just remember,
after you tell us,

18:25.839 --> 18:28.539
It's birthday toast
and the spanking machine.

18:29.641 --> 18:33.678
Charlie,
I've been seeing
a hypnotherapist.

18:33.680 --> 18:36.814
- Another therapist?
- Yes.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.783
And right before
I came here,

18:38.785 --> 18:43.221
He helped me recover
a traumatic memory.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.356
I discovered that

18:45.358 --> 18:48.559
My former hypnotherapist
groped me while I was under.

18:48.561 --> 18:50.661
Now, I know it is going
to take years

18:50.663 --> 18:52.730
For me to
work through this,

18:52.732 --> 18:56.801
But I'm so glad
that tonight

18:56.803 --> 18:59.504
I am with
the four people

18:59.506 --> 19:01.672
Who make me feel
truly safe

19:01.674 --> 19:03.841
<i>And who I know</i>

19:03.843 --> 19:06.844
Would never
take advantage of me.

19:08.514 --> 19:10.314
I'm sorry.
I need a moment.

19:14.786 --> 19:16.854
( laughs )
yikes.

19:19.658 --> 19:21.893
I guess we better cancel
the spanking machine.

19:23.762 --> 19:25.830
I'm out of here.

19:29.468 --> 19:31.302
Look, I don't wanna seem
insensitive here,

19:31.304 --> 19:34.672
But was that a "I'm never
gonna have sex again grope"

19:34.674 --> 19:37.642
Or "I'm not gonna have sex
for six months grope"?

19:37.644 --> 19:40.611
Are you kidding me?
What is wrong with you people?

19:40.613 --> 19:42.647
I'm just saying
as a phobia therapist,

19:42.649 --> 19:44.749
I think I still have
a shot with her.

19:44.751 --> 19:46.817
I did get her
to hold a snake.

19:48.320 --> 19:51.322
You're a disgrace.
You're all disgraces.

19:51.324 --> 19:54.358
- We need to figure out
a way to help this woman.
- You're right.

19:54.360 --> 19:57.228
I think she needs
another woman to go
talk to her.

19:57.230 --> 19:59.797
Don't let the door
hit you in the penises
on the way out.

19:59.799 --> 20:01.732
No, no, no, no, no.

20:01.734 --> 20:04.569
We're gonna stay here,
we're gonna make her
feel safe,

20:04.571 --> 20:06.771
And we're gonna try
and salvage what's left
of her birthday.

20:06.773 --> 20:08.272
And you know how?

20:08.274 --> 20:10.675
We're all gonna pitch
in to buy her some flowers

20:10.677 --> 20:13.411
And send her on
a nice vacation
to maui.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.646
I'll put it on my card
if you guys just give me
the cash.

20:17.482 --> 20:20.818
- Oh, my god.
That poor girl.
- I know. It's horrible.

20:20.820 --> 20:22.687
Well, at least she got
a free trip to maui

20:22.689 --> 20:25.389
That no one else
pitched in on.

20:25.391 --> 20:27.992
I still don't
understand why you took
this whole thing so far.

20:27.994 --> 20:30.795
I was frustrated.
I thought I found
someone who knew me.

20:30.797 --> 20:32.363
That I could
have a future with.

20:32.365 --> 20:33.831
You don't find
that every day.

20:33.833 --> 20:36.767
Oh, so it was about me.

20:36.769 --> 20:39.237
No, it wasn't.

20:39.239 --> 20:42.306
Okay. Come here
and I'll give you
a therapeutic hug.

20:42.308 --> 20:45.643
I don't want one of your
cold, machine-like hugs.

20:45.645 --> 20:48.012
I want somebody
who knows me,
who likes me,

20:48.014 --> 20:49.780
Who's ready
to make a commitment.

20:49.782 --> 20:53.351
Well, charlie.
I know you and I like you.

20:53.353 --> 20:55.419
And?

20:55.421 --> 20:57.455
And I'm willing
to be your friend

20:57.457 --> 21:00.891
And have sex
with you until you find
this mystery woman.

21:00.893 --> 21:04.328
Thanks.

21:04.330 --> 21:06.897
However long it takes.
Okay, time's up. Leave.

21:06.899 --> 21:08.899
Wait a minute,
you just said however
long it takes.

21:08.901 --> 21:11.569
- It could take forever.
- We're done for today.

21:11.571 --> 21:14.038
I have another client.
Look in the lobby, maybe
your mystery girl's there.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.774
Go, run!

21:16.776 --> 21:18.743
- ( sighs )
- <i>( knocks on door )</i>

21:18.745 --> 21:21.045
What if I've already met
my mystery girl?

21:21.047 --> 21:23.748
You haven't.
