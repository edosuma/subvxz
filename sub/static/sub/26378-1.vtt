handle it.

on his face,

it felt like there was
something else going on,

12:51.830 --> 12:53.460
Suit yourself.

13:02.879 --> 13:06.539
What part of "stay
where you are" didn't he get?

13:06.539 --> 13:09.120
S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent
Daisy Johnson.

13:09.120 --> 13:11.539
I'd like to call my lawyer,

13:11.539 --> 13:13.710
but I don't have one.

13:13.710 --> 13:15.330
So just skip it and read us
our rights.

13:15.330 --> 13:16.580
Why would I do that?

13:16.580 --> 13:18.419
Uh, 'cause we're being arrested.

13:18.419 --> 13:21.330

13:40.039 --> 13:41.539

13:41.539 --> 13:43.419
Why don't you just tell us
what happened here?

13:43.419 --> 13:46.080
It's complicated.

13:43.419 --> 13:46.080
No, it's not. It's simple.

13:46.080 --> 13:48.330
We were trying to nab this
Inhuman with fire powers

13:48.330 --> 13:50.330
and totally lost it,
and this other Inhuman, Victor,

13:50.330 --> 13:53.120
tried to help,
but the whole thing was a bust.

13:53.120 --> 13:54.669
Two Inhumans?

13:54.669 --> 13:56.120
Why does it matter?

13:56.120 --> 13:57.419
You have something against
Inhumans?

13:57.419 --> 14:01.960
No. No, but it's a part
of a pattern.

14:01.960 --> 14:03.830
I'm with the S.H.I.E.L.D.
Analytics Division,

14:03.830 --> 14:06.539
and I've been tracking the spike
in violent Inhuman incidents,

14:06.539 --> 14:08.919
but that's not the whole story.

14:08.919 --> 14:11.379
Over half the teens
identified in the attacks--

14:11.379 --> 14:13.169
we can't find them anywhere.

14:13.169 --> 14:14.750
It's like they've
disappeared into thin air.

14:14.750 --> 14:17.169
Victor said he was working
for a group

14:17.169 --> 14:18.289
trying to stop the violence.

14:18.289 --> 14:19.419
Maybe he could help.

14:19.419 --> 14:21.120
Except that he ran,

14:21.120 --> 14:23.580
which makes him a potential
suspect in my book.

14:23.580 --> 14:24.919
Nuts to that!

14:24.919 --> 14:26.330
Victor stepped in to help us

14:26.330 --> 14:28.169
when nobody else was around,
including you.

14:28.169 --> 14:29.500
He's a hero.

14:29.500 --> 14:31.539
That doesn't put him
above the law.

14:31.539 --> 14:33.169
So how do you want
to handle this?

14:33.169 --> 14:34.500
Since you guys probably
got the tech

14:34.500 --> 14:36.169
to track Victor's portals...

14:36.169 --> 14:38.539
Squirrel Girl and I will fan
out and look for Dante.

14:38.539 --> 14:41.289

14:38.539 --> 14:41.289
Or you could go home.

14:41.289 --> 14:44.120

take it from here.

14:45.250 --> 14:47.289

14:55.620 --> 14:57.750

bring up powers?

14:57.750 --> 15:00.419
We don't need powers.

15:00.419 --> 15:03.330
Your quake gauntlets
could take down a skyscraper.

15:03.330 --> 15:05.500
And I was trained
by Captain America.

15:05.500 --> 15:08.750
I know. I read it
on your Hero Watch App page.

15:08.750 --> 15:11.539
I love the new profile picture.

15:11.539 --> 15:12.789
Hmm.

15:22.330 --> 15:24.830
Who cares what they think?

15:24.830 --> 15:26.789
We know what we are.

15:26.789 --> 15:29.379

15:45.210 --> 15:47.120
Yeah, I'm not gonna translate it
word for word

15:47.120 --> 15:50.710
because we both know it went on
a little too long,

15:50.710 --> 15:52.500
but here's the short of it--

15:52.500 --> 15:54.580
Captain Marvel
would never give up

15:54.580 --> 15:56.330
when there's justice to be done.

15:56.330 --> 15:58.039

You're right, Tippy.

But so was
that S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.

16:00.250 --> 16:03.169
I think there's more to
this whole Victor-Dante story,

16:03.169 --> 16:05.620
and we're gonna find out
what it is.

25:43.920 --> 25:46.079
So much for my bike.

25:47.500 --> 25:50.880
Stand back.
I've got this. Okay?

25:50.880 --> 25:54.829
Variable frequency vibration
generating gauntlets, huh?

25:54.829 --> 25:56.710
Yeah.
They makes things shake.

26:08.460 --> 26:10.500
Huh, I thought
you weren't here to help.

26:10.500 --> 26:13.579
I'm not.
I'm just a chump.

26:14.920 --> 26:18.079
They're gone.
No sign of the Inhumans.

26:18.079 --> 26:20.079
The way you just said that
makes it sound like

26:20.079 --> 26:22.250
they're automatically guilty
of something,

26:22.250 --> 26:24.289
but we don't know anything
for sure.

26:24.289 --> 26:26.119
Victor claims Dante's a threat,

26:26.119 --> 26:29.039
but Dante had every chance
to hurt Victor and he didn't.

26:29.039 --> 26:30.420
Hey, you know what he did do?

26:30.420 --> 26:32.539
Steal my bike and fry half
the neighborhood.

26:32.539 --> 26:34.420
Pretty sure that's
still against the law.

26:34.420 --> 26:36.460
Yeah, and I'm pretty sure

26:36.460 --> 26:37.880
we could've kept things
under control

26:37.880 --> 26:40.329
if you hadn't ripped up
that gas line.

26:40.329 --> 26:42.210
So why don't you drop
the attitude,

26:42.210 --> 26:44.460
and help us find out
what's actually going on?

26:44.460 --> 26:46.460
No, because
what's happening here

26:46.460 --> 26:49.460
isn't something
the Junior Avengers
are gonna be able to stop.

26:49.460 --> 26:52.539
And I don't need any lectures
on morality,

26:52.539 --> 26:54.500
especially from somebody
like you.

27:14.289 --> 27:16.750
Finally, the cavalry is here.

27:16.750 --> 27:19.329
Daisy Johnson,
you are being placed
into custody

27:19.329 --> 27:21.500
on charges of forgery,
dereliction of duty,

27:21.500 --> 27:24.170
and unsanctioned action.

27:24.170 --> 27:25.539
What?

27:25.539 --> 27:28.119
You're not authorized
either, Cap Jr.

27:28.119 --> 27:30.920
That is total bunk. We're--

27:28.119 --> 27:30.920
No, let him go.

27:30.920 --> 27:33.880
He didn't know anything
about this. It was all me.

27:33.880 --> 27:36.380
You lied to me?

27:33.880 --> 27:36.380
I had to.

27:36.380 --> 27:39.960
You know how much red tape
we have to go through to get
anything done.

27:39.960 --> 27:41.170
I couldn't wait
for some committee

27:41.170 --> 27:42.380
to decide what to do.

27:42.380 --> 27:43.750
So you conned me

27:43.750 --> 27:45.460
rather than stick to the rules?

27:45.460 --> 27:46.670
You know how hard it's been

27:46.670 --> 27:48.079
for me to be taken seriously,

27:48.079 --> 27:50.250
and yet you pulled this?

27:50.250 --> 27:51.619
I hope they lock you up.

27:54.079 --> 27:55.289
[chittering]

27:57.170 --> 28:00.420
I know, I know.
Just give them a second.

28:00.420 --> 28:01.750
[inhales]

28:01.750 --> 28:06.420
Okay, so that was not good,

28:06.420 --> 28:09.500
um, but I agree with Tippy.

28:09.500 --> 28:13.500
We've gotta pick ourselves up
and get back to work.

28:13.500 --> 28:17.170
It's time for action!
What do you say?

28:17.170 --> 28:20.079
[chitters]

28:20.079 --> 28:22.329
I say you could take
things down a notch.

28:22.329 --> 28:26.000
Hm? Hm-hm-hm hm?

28:26.000 --> 28:27.210
But yes.

28:27.210 --> 28:28.880
I'm in.

28:28.880 --> 28:30.329
Whoo-hoo!

28:30.329 --> 28:33.119
Now, let's get going
and catch that guy Dante!

28:33.119 --> 28:34.750
He is going down.

28:34.750 --> 28:37.539
What? S.G., have you been
listening to me at all?

28:37.539 --> 28:39.750
I know it looks
like he's the bad guy,

28:39.750 --> 28:42.000
but if you could've seen him,
he--

28:42.000 --> 28:45.460
he's-- he's going
through something.

28:45.460 --> 28:46.750
Do you actually know that?

28:46.750 --> 28:48.289
Are you a psychic, too?

28:48.289 --> 28:51.210
No, but I am Inhuman.

28:51.210 --> 28:54.329
I was at a party
when the Terrigen Wave hit.

28:56.420 --> 28:58.119
<i>It changed everything.</i>

28:58.119 --> 29:00.289
[coughing]

29:01.380 --> 29:05.329
[grunting, groaning]

29:18.960 --> 29:20.170
Huh?

29:22.170 --> 29:25.750
[gasping]

29:47.210 --> 29:49.920
<i>I could barely function
at the beginning.</i>

29:49.920 --> 29:52.289
<i>If my powers could've set
things on fire,</i>

29:52.289 --> 29:55.329
I might've burned a lot more
than my house to the ground.

29:55.329 --> 29:59.119
You can't def--
How can you defend him?

29:59.119 --> 30:02.380
He tried to roast us
like marshmallows.

30:02.380 --> 30:06.420
You can't give him a pass
just because he's Inhuman.

30:06.420 --> 30:09.079
That is seriously the worst
thing you've ever said to me.

30:09.079 --> 30:10.880
I'm not giving anybody a pass,

30:10.880 --> 30:12.289
including Victor, by the way.

30:12.289 --> 30:14.039
Did it ever cross your mind

30:14.039 --> 30:16.000
that he might not be
the one telling the truth?

30:16.000 --> 30:19.710
The guy who risked his life
to help us?

30:19.710 --> 30:22.380
No, 'cause that's
what we would've done--

30:22.380 --> 30:24.250
acted like heroes.

30:24.250 --> 30:26.670
It's that simple, Double-M,
black and white.

30:26.670 --> 30:29.250
You need to wake up
and see that!

30:29.250 --> 30:32.670
Really? 'Cause I'll tell you
what I don't need-- this,

30:32.670 --> 30:35.460
any of it, especially
from my best friend.

30:35.460 --> 30:36.920
[chitters]

30:36.920 --> 30:38.920
How's that for black and white?

30:43.210 --> 30:46.250
Double-M? Double-M!

30:56.289 --> 30:58.829
How am I ever
supposed to be you?

31:01.119 --> 31:03.210
[rings]

31:05.460 --> 31:07.500
[rings]

31:10.579 --> 31:12.380
Kamala, I heard a noise...

31:12.380 --> 31:13.920
I dropped my phone, Okay?

31:13.920 --> 31:16.119
And no, Mom,
I was not talking to a boy.

31:16.119 --> 31:19.460
And yes, I did my homework
and put away my "toys,"

31:19.460 --> 31:21.880
and I really don't need
another person

31:21.880 --> 31:24.750
telling me how to live my life,
so good night! Ugh!

31:27.460 --> 31:29.460
<i>Acha...</i>

31:29.460 --> 31:32.579
are you ready to tell me
what's really bothering you?

31:36.460 --> 31:38.579
It's exhausting, Ammi.

31:38.579 --> 31:42.920
When you feel like something's
true, like in your gut...

31:42.920 --> 31:45.500
but everyone else tells you
otherwise...

31:45.500 --> 31:48.460
or thinks you're crazy.

31:48.460 --> 31:50.210
[chuckles]

31:50.210 --> 31:54.119
You know, my mother didn't want
me to marry your father.

31:54.119 --> 31:56.210
Yeah. Thought he was
too much of a dreamer,

31:56.210 --> 31:58.250
an adventurer.

31:58.250 --> 31:59.420
Ha.

31:59.420 --> 32:01.579
Jersey City.
What an adventure.

32:01.579 --> 32:03.789
[chuckles]

32:03.789 --> 32:08.000
Anyway,
I couldn't break her heart,

32:08.000 --> 32:11.170
so I told your father no.

32:11.170 --> 32:13.750
But the day before he was
leaving for America,

32:13.750 --> 32:17.289
he left me a note
from his favorite poet--

32:17.289 --> 32:19.920
"Your heart knows the way.

32:19.920 --> 32:22.210
Run in that direction."

32:22.210 --> 32:24.710
I showed it to my mother...

32:24.710 --> 32:28.119
and a week later
we were married.

32:28.119 --> 32:32.500
Now your grandmother
can't go a week without talking
to her favorite son-in-law.

32:32.500 --> 32:36.289
Sometimes I think she likes him
more than me.

32:36.289 --> 32:39.500
<i>Beti, </i> you already know
 what to do.

32:39.500 --> 32:41.750
Have faith
in what you believe...

32:41.750 --> 32:44.920
and help others see
what you see.

32:44.920 --> 32:47.329
But be patient with people,
Kamala.

32:47.329 --> 32:50.920
Everyone has their struggles.

32:52.380 --> 32:54.329
Thank you, Ammi.

32:54.329 --> 32:57.880
I really hope this wasn't
about a boy.

32:57.880 --> 32:58.960
Ugh...

33:00.750 --> 33:02.380
Now, get some sleep. Huh?

33:02.380 --> 33:03.539
Good night.

33:03.539 --> 33:05.250
Good night.

33:12.380 --> 33:15.170
<i>I'm Doreen.
You're leaving a message.</i>

33:15.170 --> 33:18.000
Ugh, voicemail.
Doreen, it's me.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.829
Oh, I really wish
you were there,

33:19.829 --> 33:22.210
but know that I'm not
giving up on this.

33:22.210 --> 33:23.500
I'm going to find
Victor and Dante,

33:23.500 --> 33:25.619
so listen up.

33:25.619 --> 33:28.380
[Ms. Marvel sighs]
They've got to be somewhere
on the island.

33:32.079 --> 33:34.289
[whooshes]

33:34.289 --> 33:36.039
Hey.

33:34.289 --> 33:36.039
Victor?

33:38.039 --> 33:39.880
Okay, this is weird.

33:39.880 --> 33:41.789
How did you find me?

33:41.789 --> 33:43.210
Luck, I guess.

33:43.210 --> 33:45.829
Okay, maybe Hero Watch helped me
out, too.

33:45.829 --> 33:49.289
Listen, the way I left before--

33:49.289 --> 33:51.000
I was wrong.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.579
I'm just tired, you know?

33:54.579 --> 33:56.079
I've been on this job
for weeks,

33:56.079 --> 33:57.539
trying to help Dante

33:57.539 --> 34:01.539
and make the world
a little safer.

34:01.539 --> 34:05.750
I just wanna prove to everybody
that I can handle things
on my own.

34:05.750 --> 34:06.880
Yeah, I get it.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.579
But, I don't know.

34:11.460 --> 34:14.460
Maybe it's time to stop acting
like I've got all the answers.

34:14.460 --> 34:18.960
So maybe you
and I could join forces.

34:18.960 --> 34:23.539
I'm-- I'm, uh-- yeah,
I guess we could,

34:23.539 --> 34:25.460
you know, maybe?

34:25.460 --> 34:27.420
I was hoping you'd say that.

34:27.420 --> 34:29.250
'Cause I've already talked
to my superior.

34:29.250 --> 34:32.750
She thinks you're a great
candidate for our organization.

34:32.750 --> 34:34.710
Wait, what?

34:34.710 --> 34:37.789
No, I think you've got
the wrong idea.

34:37.789 --> 34:39.960
I mean,
I'm more than happy to--

34:41.960 --> 34:43.000
Victor?

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
Sorry to cut you off like that,

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
but since the answer was "no,"

34:47.000 --> 34:49.500
I figured we should just skip to
the part where I knock you out

34:49.500 --> 34:51.000
and take you where I want.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.210
[laughs]

35:01.000 --> 35:02.539
[laughs]

35:02.539 --> 35:05.380
After all, it's not like you,

35:05.380 --> 35:07.500
or any of them for that matter,

35:07.500 --> 35:09.420
really had a choice.

35:09.420 --> 35:12.079
Victor, how could you do this--

35:12.079 --> 35:15.039
turn on your own when you know
what we've been through?

35:15.039 --> 35:16.670
The name's not Victor.

35:16.670 --> 35:18.170
It's Exile.

35:18.170 --> 35:20.789
And I'm not turning on anyone.

35:20.789 --> 35:22.329
I'm giving them an opportunity

35:22.329 --> 35:23.960
to protect their makers,

35:23.960 --> 35:26.460
the ones who designed
the Inhuman genome.

35:26.460 --> 35:28.460
You mean, the Kree?

35:28.460 --> 35:31.000
What does this have to do
with some alien species

35:31.000 --> 35:32.539
that left thousands
of years ago

35:32.539 --> 35:33.789
and are never coming back?

35:33.789 --> 35:35.000
Don't be dense.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.079
A Kree spaceship
is already in orbit.

35:39.750 --> 35:41.380
<i>Their leader, Hala,</i>

35:41.380 --> 35:44.579
<i>saw the rise of Inhumans
after the Terrigen Wave.</i>

35:44.579 --> 35:46.420
<i>Recognizing our potential,</i>

35:46.420 --> 35:48.789
<i>she began recruiting us,</i>

35:48.789 --> 35:51.119
<i>the finest warriors
in the galaxy</i>

35:51.119 --> 35:53.789
<i>to serve the Kree Empire.</i>

35:55.960 --> 35:57.750
We've crisscrossed the world,

35:57.750 --> 35:59.210
looking for
the perfect candidates

35:59.210 --> 36:00.920
to prove their worth.

36:00.920 --> 36:04.460
We like to call it
a "Final Exam."

36:04.460 --> 36:07.170
What about the ones
who've got nothing to prove?

36:07.170 --> 36:10.039
It's my job to change
their minds.

36:11.960 --> 36:14.880
Dante--
he didn't blast at us.

36:22.420 --> 36:23.880
He was aiming at you...

36:23.880 --> 36:25.579
Too bad Dante missed.

36:25.579 --> 36:27.329
But at least he got away.

36:27.329 --> 36:29.119
Not for long.

36:29.119 --> 36:31.420
Why do you think
I've moved on to you?

36:31.420 --> 36:32.710
[grunts]

36:34.579 --> 36:37.079
Next time don't talk so much.

37:05.829 --> 37:06.829
[gasps]

37:14.500 --> 37:16.250
[gasps]
You can heal.

37:16.250 --> 37:17.829
Let's find out how quick.

37:32.960 --> 37:34.880
Keep your eyes peeled, Tippy.

37:34.880 --> 37:37.460
She comes here when she needs
a place to think.

37:37.460 --> 37:39.710
[chitters]

37:42.960 --> 37:44.420
Oh, nuts!

37:48.670 --> 37:49.960
Aah!

37:49.960 --> 37:51.420
Kamala!

38:09.000 --> 38:10.250
Double-M!

38:16.460 --> 38:18.670
You put up way more
of a fight than Dante.

38:20.920 --> 38:23.210
Wanna give up?
Come on. It'll be great.

38:23.210 --> 38:25.460
I can call my friends
at S.H.I.E.L.D. right now.

38:25.460 --> 38:27.210
And if you're nice,

38:27.210 --> 38:29.880
I'll even help you pick out
a real sweet prison cell.

38:29.880 --> 38:31.670
[chuckles]
Sounds great.

38:31.670 --> 38:34.789
But can I just say one thing?

38:34.789 --> 38:36.920
I'm not the only one
who talks too much.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
[gasps]

38:45.210 --> 38:46.670
Ha!

38:46.670 --> 38:49.079
No!

38:50.289 --> 38:52.170
Kamala.

39:02.460 --> 39:04.500
What are we gonna do, Tippy?

39:04.500 --> 39:09.210
How do you find someone
who just vanished into a portal?

39:09.210 --> 39:11.119
That voicemail she left.

39:11.119 --> 39:13.619
She said
that I was her best friend

39:13.619 --> 39:16.329
and that we'd work it out.

39:16.329 --> 39:19.039
But I didn't get to tell her
how sorry I am

39:19.039 --> 39:20.579
that I didn't listen to her,

39:20.579 --> 39:24.579
that I judged her
for being Inhuman.

39:24.579 --> 39:27.789
That's not who I am.

39:27.789 --> 39:30.710
What if I never get to tell her?

39:30.710 --> 39:32.210
[phone chirps]

39:32.210 --> 39:33.829

39:35.619 --> 39:37.539

an audio message

39:37.539 --> 39:38.920
on our Hero Watch page.

I'm on a spaceship,</i>

39:46.250 --> 39:48.960
<i>But you have to hurry...</i>

39:48.960 --> 39:52.170
Whoo-hoo! She did it!
She sent us a clue!

39:52.170 --> 39:54.750
And she used the app
all by herself!

39:54.750 --> 39:56.079
Now that's a hero!

39:56.079 --> 39:57.710
[chittering]

39:59.829 --> 40:03.500
Okay, Tippy.
Let's do this.

40:03.500 --> 40:06.880
Double-M said "spaceship"
and "orbit,"

40:06.880 --> 40:11.210
so hopefully she's
right up there somewhere,

40:11.210 --> 40:13.500
circling the Earth.

40:13.500 --> 40:17.079
But how do we get up there?

40:17.079 --> 40:20.079
Hmm? Tony Stark!

40:20.079 --> 40:22.670
He's gotta have
a spare spaceship
we can borrow.

40:22.670 --> 40:25.000
[chittering]

40:25.000 --> 40:28.210
You're right.
I can't break into
the Stark Tower

40:28.210 --> 40:30.750
and steal a spaceship.

40:30.750 --> 40:33.250
Not alone, anyway.

40:33.250 --> 40:35.250
I need some serious muscle
for that.

40:35.250 --> 40:38.170
So, what do you say?

40:38.170 --> 40:41.289
[scoffs]
I'd say you don't even
know my name, Squirrel Kid.

40:41.289 --> 40:44.880

40:44.880 --> 40:48.170

And you are, again?

40:48.170 --> 40:51.210
America Chavez,
as in "not interested."

40:51.210 --> 40:54.250
But you helped that guy
under the fire escape.
You're a good person.

40:54.250 --> 40:56.670
And good people
should wanna help
other good people.

40:56.670 --> 40:59.920
And yet I'm not convinced.

40:59.920 --> 41:03.250
Hey, I heard what you said
right before you took off.

41:03.250 --> 41:05.460
You know what's going on,
don't you?

41:05.460 --> 41:09.039
How? And why aren't you
doing anything about it?

41:09.039 --> 41:13.619
I know,
because what's happening here
happened to my world,

41:13.619 --> 41:15.619
and it can't be stopped.

41:15.619 --> 41:18.250

41:18.250 --> 41:21.710

41:28.539 --> 41:30.789

to save the world.</i>

41:34.670 --> 41:38.079

and I begged them
to let me fight,</i>

41:38.079 --> 41:41.250
<i>to let me stand for something,
just like them.</i>

41:43.829 --> 41:47.170
<i>But they lied to me.
They told me
they invented a machine</i>

41:47.170 --> 41:50.500
<i>that would make me
strong enough to help them.</i>

41:50.500 --> 41:53.579

an interdimensional teleporter.</i>

41:53.579 --> 41:57.210
<i>They never wanted me
to help them.</i>

41:57.210 --> 42:00.119

as a kid.</i>

42:55.119 --> 42:56.829
So why aren't you?

42:56.829 --> 42:59.380
Because it cost them everything!

42:59.380 --> 43:01.960
No, not everything.

43:01.960 --> 43:04.880
They were heroes,
and they'll always be that!

who's kidnapped Ms. Marvel

44:13.210 --> 44:16.289

orbiting the planet as we speak.

44:16.289 --> 44:18.579

for any sign

49:42.210 --> 49:45.250
of unidentified ships
within the lower
and medium orbit zones.

49:45.250 --> 49:47.250
Higher than that,
and we can't
reach it in this jet.

49:47.250 --> 49:50.039
[trilling]

49:50.039 --> 49:52.750
[beeping]

49:50.039 --> 49:52.750
Hm. Bingo.

49:52.750 --> 49:54.750
Looks like we've got
a Kree Imperial Cruiser

49:54.750 --> 49:56.960
trying to hide behind
a decommissioned satellite.

49:56.960 --> 49:58.829
Kree?!

49:58.829 --> 50:01.500
They haven't been here
in thousands of years.

50:01.500 --> 50:03.960
Who are the Kree?

50:03.960 --> 50:05.960
Militaristic alien race.

50:05.960 --> 50:08.000
They tried to build
a legion of super-soldiers

50:08.000 --> 50:10.170
by altering human DNA.

50:10.170 --> 50:12.579
Basically,
they created the Inhumans,

50:12.579 --> 50:14.920
but they never finished
the project.

50:14.920 --> 50:18.079
You told me this whole thing
happened on your planet too.

50:18.079 --> 50:21.500
Do you remember your moms
saying anything
about the Kree?

50:21.500 --> 50:25.750
No. But they didn't think
the Inhumans
were acting on their own.

50:25.750 --> 50:28.579
Maybe they're not now either.

50:28.579 --> 50:31.579
Double-M thought Dante
was trying to run away
from Victor.

50:31.579 --> 50:36.000
She tried to do the same thing,
and now she's being held
on some Kree spaceship.

50:36.000 --> 50:37.960
What if she's not
the only one?

50:37.960 --> 50:40.500
Those missing Inhuman kids--

50:40.500 --> 50:43.119
they weren't
fighting each other,
they were being hunted.

50:43.119 --> 50:46.380
The Terrigen Mist
activated their powers.

50:46.380 --> 50:49.170
And now the Kree are back
to pick up their recruits.

50:49.170 --> 50:50.960
We're gonna need help.

50:50.960 --> 50:52.750
So let's recap.

50:52.750 --> 50:55.960
We're fugitives and thieves.
Who exactly do we call?

50:55.960 --> 50:57.960
An old friend.

51:11.250 --> 51:14.619
<i>[groaning]</i>

51:14.619 --> 51:17.000
<i>Where am I?</i>

51:21.500 --> 51:22.750
[groans]

51:26.210 --> 51:28.710
What is this place?

51:28.710 --> 51:31.329
[Dante] I think they call it
the "lion's den."

51:28.710 --> 51:31.329
[gasps]

51:31.329 --> 51:34.000
I'm not gonna hurt you.

51:31.329 --> 51:34.000
I know that.

51:34.000 --> 51:37.079
I saw you walk away from Victor,
and I know what he is.

51:37.079 --> 51:39.039
None of this
is your fault.

51:39.039 --> 51:42.750
[sighs]
I've waited a long time
for somebody to say that.

51:42.750 --> 51:44.670
Does it ever get easier?

51:44.670 --> 51:47.920
You mean...
being who we are?

51:47.920 --> 51:50.000
Honestly, I'm not sure.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.380
But I'm doing my best
to find out.

51:52.380 --> 51:55.920
I tried to keep
my powers a secret
for a long time.

51:55.920 --> 51:59.619
Then I'd panic,
and there'd be nothing but fire.

51:59.619 --> 52:02.210
You should've seen the way
that my family looked at me.

52:04.539 --> 52:08.960
Especially after Victor
showed up, and I burned
everything to the ground.

52:08.960 --> 52:11.039
Running was
the only option.

52:15.829 --> 52:19.789
<i>Greetings,
my Inhuman warriors.</i>

52:19.789 --> 52:22.119
<i>I am Hala the Accuser.</i>

52:22.119 --> 52:26.289
<i>You are currently charged
with refusing to serve
the Kree Empire.</i>

52:26.289 --> 52:29.210
But we are offering you
a second chance

52:29.210 --> 52:31.920
to embrace this noble cause.

52:31.920 --> 52:35.619
Your world may see you
as mere children,

52:35.619 --> 52:39.039
but I see what you're truly
destined to become--

52:39.039 --> 52:43.460
warriors, heroes,
defenders of the Kree.

52:44.420 --> 52:46.920
Your mission is simple:

52:46.920 --> 52:49.000
defeat the opponent
standing next to you

52:49.000 --> 52:51.289
and move on to the next round.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.289
[bell ringing]

52:51.289 --> 52:55.710
The victors will be revered
on a thousand worlds.

52:55.710 --> 52:58.000
<i>Those that fail
or refuse to fight</i>

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
<i>will be forced to watch

53:00.000 --> 53:02.829
<i>at the hands
of my Kree armada. </i>

53:00.000 --> 53:02.829

53:04.000 --> 53:05.619

Ammi!

53:05.619 --> 53:07.829

without families...</i>

53:10.000 --> 53:12.460
<i>Well, no one
will miss you anyway.</i>

53:40.079 --> 53:42.170

the same side.

53:44.579 --> 53:48.920

Only one of us is walking
out of here alive.

53:48.920 --> 53:51.119
[grunts]

53:53.829 --> 53:56.210

01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:47.039
It's just that...
I'm kind of your biggest fan.

01:12:47.039 --> 01:12:50.170
I even have a video of you
on my phone that I watch
all the time.

01:12:50.170 --> 01:12:54.789
Which, now that
I've said it out loud,
is also pretty weird.

01:12:54.789 --> 01:12:58.500
But all I've ever wanted
is to be you.

01:12:59.670 --> 01:13:03.460
[chuckles]
Listen, kiddo.

01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:05.829
I'm flattered. And, yeah,

01:13:05.829 --> 01:13:08.710
I can be pretty great.

01:13:08.710 --> 01:13:10.420
But so can you.

01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:12.420
Nobody needs to be
anybody else.

01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:14.880
Can't be done.
You just gotta be you.

01:13:21.710 --> 01:13:25.829
Yes! I am never
washing my hand again.

01:13:39.579 --> 01:13:43.619
So, we're good, right?

01:13:43.619 --> 01:13:48.119
I mean, you said you were sorry,
and I said I was sorry, but...

01:13:48.119 --> 01:13:51.380
I kept pushing you
to see things my way,

01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:55.170
like I knew everything,
and you were just being a pain.

01:13:55.170 --> 01:13:59.420
But you knew in your gut
that there was more to it.

01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:02.619
That's who you are.

01:14:02.619 --> 01:14:06.460
And I-- I wouldn't listen.

01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:08.710
You're not
the only one, D.

01:14:08.710 --> 01:14:11.670
You've always believed in us
and what we can do.

01:14:11.670 --> 01:14:14.880
But most of the time,
I just rained on your parade.

01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:18.329
Probably 'cause I was scared
that I'd never be
who I really wanted to be.

01:14:18.329 --> 01:14:22.079
[chuckles]
Guess we could both learn
something from each other.

01:14:22.079 --> 01:14:23.750
So true.

01:14:28.829 --> 01:14:31.539
Did we get
the wrong time?

01:14:33.250 --> 01:14:35.039
[Doreen]
Nope. 7:00.

01:14:35.039 --> 01:14:36.670
And this is
America's garage.

01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:52.079
Hello? Anyone here?

01:14:58.710 --> 01:15:00.960
[laughing]

01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:03.619
[air whooshing]

01:15:03.619 --> 01:15:06.920
[both laughing]

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:11.579
[laughing continues]

01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:15.710
[both]
Huh?

01:15:15.710 --> 01:15:17.619
[beeping]

01:15:17.619 --> 01:15:19.079
[both gasp]

01:15:23.289 --> 01:15:25.500
Whoa! Secret elevator!

01:15:29.670 --> 01:15:32.920
[both shriek]

01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:35.289
[panting]

01:15:36.289 --> 01:15:37.960
[both exclaim]

01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:39.960
[yells, laughs]

01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:42.829
Mush-face! I missed you!

01:15:42.829 --> 01:15:44.289
Patriot!

01:15:44.289 --> 01:15:46.670
I'm out of uniform,
so it's Rayshaun.

01:15:46.670 --> 01:15:49.380
Or Mr. Lucas.
But that would be weird.

01:15:49.380 --> 01:15:51.170
Huh?
[grunts]

01:15:51.170 --> 01:15:53.500
Although no weirder
than this.

01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:55.619
Oh, come on.
You love it.

01:15:55.619 --> 01:15:57.289
[chittering]

01:15:58.750 --> 01:16:00.420
[panting]

01:16:00.420 --> 01:16:04.079
What is this place?
It's amazing!

01:16:04.079 --> 01:16:05.460
Want it?

01:16:09.579 --> 01:16:13.079
Your first adventure
may not have been perfect,

01:16:13.079 --> 01:16:15.460
but you saw a pattern
no one else did.

01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:20.420
And you fought odds
that would've made
the Avengers think twice.

01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:23.329
I know that people
may have doubted you
in the past.

01:16:23.329 --> 01:16:26.460
You might have
even doubted yourselves.

01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:30.250
But I wanna see how far
you can go with a little support

01:16:30.250 --> 01:16:32.420
instead of mistrust.

01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:37.039
You'll report to me,
but you'll be your own
unofficial team.

01:16:37.039 --> 01:16:40.619
And I do mean unofficial.
What do you think?

01:16:40.619 --> 01:16:43.289
[all cheering]

01:16:45.329 --> 01:16:48.000
[cheering, laughing]

01:16:49.619 --> 01:16:52.250
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

01:16:49.619 --> 01:16:52.250
Yeah! Yeah!

01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:55.960
Hey, the Avengers
bought the garage.

01:16:55.960 --> 01:17:00.039
What choice do I have?
So... yay.

01:17:00.039 --> 01:17:03.250
And there's one young woman
who is not only the finest

01:17:03.250 --> 01:17:04.920
S.H.I.E.L.D. recruit
I've ever seen,

01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:08.119
but who just led her team
when it needed her most.

01:17:08.119 --> 01:17:11.079
Daisy, think you
can take the helm?

01:17:08.119 --> 01:17:11.079
[gasps]

01:17:11.079 --> 01:17:12.880
Yeah!

01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:14.619
I mean, yes, ma'am.

01:17:14.619 --> 01:17:16.619
Whoo-hoo! We got a leader.
We got a base.

01:17:16.619 --> 01:17:19.829
All we need is a name,
and we'll be ready for battle.

01:17:19.829 --> 01:17:22.670
You'll be ready to train...
in secret.

01:17:22.670 --> 01:17:24.380
No battling yet.

01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:26.619
That's my job.
One thing you're not

01:17:26.619 --> 01:17:29.119
is some kind of
Secret Avengers team.

01:17:29.119 --> 01:17:31.710
Got it? Good.

01:17:31.710 --> 01:17:35.539
Now go. I'll see you
tomorrow morning,
bright and early.

01:17:35.539 --> 01:17:38.920
We hear ya, boss.
No Secret Avengers!

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:42.380
I got a better name anyway.
"Secret Warriors."

01:17:42.380 --> 01:17:44.880
Not officially, of course.
What do you guys think?

01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:48.880
I think we should've asked
to stay and check out the place
so I could pick out my room.

01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:53.039
I'm pretty sure
it's the leader's job
to assign rooms. Right, chief?

01:17:53.039 --> 01:17:56.920
And I think
it goes without saying
that some of us have seniority.

01:17:56.920 --> 01:17:59.000
You want me to toast him?

01:18:05.210 --> 01:18:09.420
<i>[Kamala] Guess I probably
don't need this anymore
now that I actually know her.</i>

01:18:09.420 --> 01:18:12.000
Pretty cool.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.829
<i>But it helps remind me
of what I'm here for, </i>

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.829
[laughing]

01:18:14.829 --> 01:18:17.329
[chattering]

01:18:14.829 --> 01:18:17.329
<i>what we're all here for--</i>

01:18:17.329 --> 01:18:19.789
<i>to find the truth.</i>

01:18:19.789 --> 01:18:24.539
<i>Not just about the world,
but about who we are.</i>

01:18:24.539 --> 01:18:27.920
<i>And believe in it
when nobody else does.</i>

01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:30.750
<i>I think that's what
this whole thing's been about--</i>

01:18:30.750 --> 01:18:33.539
<i>going beyond
where you think you can go.</i>

01:18:33.539 --> 01:18:38.079
<i>Reaching for what's true
when it seems impossible
to find.</i>

01:18:38.079 --> 01:18:40.460
<i>Rising to each challenge
no matter the odds,</i>

01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:43.420
<i>because that's what heroes do.</i>

01:18:43.420 --> 01:18:45.420
<i>They rise.</i>

01:18:55.670 --> 01:18:58.460
[snoring]

01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:02.789
[sniffing]

01:19:02.789 --> 01:19:04.329
You know,

01:19:04.329 --> 01:19:06.670
you probably should've let them
thank you in person.

01:19:06.670 --> 01:19:09.380
I couldn't have done this
without you.

01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:12.500
I'm surprised you were willing
to give Rayshaun up.

01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:14.829
He's got real potential.

01:19:14.829 --> 01:19:17.460
Agreed. Which is why
he deserves a chance

01:19:17.460 --> 01:19:20.420
to step out of my shadow
and make it on his own.

01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:22.289
They all do.

01:19:22.289 --> 01:19:25.710
But you didn't come
all the way from Asgard
just to say that.

01:19:25.710 --> 01:19:27.250
The talks went fine.

01:19:27.250 --> 01:19:29.789
But I came back to a problem
I need help with.

01:19:29.789 --> 01:19:33.210
Know any heroes
who can keep a low profile?

01:19:29.789 --> 01:19:33.210
[Squirrel Girl] Captain Marvel?

01:19:33.210 --> 01:19:36.420
Are you still here? I, uh--
I think I dropped my--

01:19:37.619 --> 01:19:39.710
[yells]

01:19:39.710 --> 01:19:44.329
Sweet Spanish almonds!
It's Captain America!

01:19:44.329 --> 01:19:48.119
[sniffing]

01:19:49.789 --> 01:19:51.789
So that's what freedom
smells like.
