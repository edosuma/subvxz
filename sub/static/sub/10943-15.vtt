Custody?

00:03.613 --> 00:04.846
Well, joint custody.

00:04.915 --> 00:05.915
I got a private detective.

00:05.983 --> 00:07.182
My lawyer told me
to get one.

00:07.250 --> 00:09.084
How else am I gonna build
a custody case?

00:09.151 --> 00:11.486
Why don't we just
buy a house?

00:11.553 --> 00:13.855
- Are you serious?
Buy a house? - Yeah.

<i>What's Mrs. Bell doing here?</i>

00:17.659 --> 00:20.395
Mr. Hanley: Her family used to own
this farm before my dad bought it.

00:21.364 --> 00:24.164
Must be some loved ones
buried out there.

00:26.301 --> 00:28.202
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Mr. Hanley?</i>

00:28.270 --> 00:30.004
I'm gonna recommend you
on our Heartland website.

00:30.071 --> 00:31.705
Why would you
do that for me?

00:31.773 --> 00:33.274
Because you care about horses

00:33.341 --> 00:34.975
and that says a lot
about a person.

So when did Mr. Hanley call you?

01:02.235 --> 01:03.802
Last night.

01:03.869 --> 01:05.503
So he took on
some more rescue horses?

01:05.571 --> 01:07.505
Apparently.

01:07.573 --> 01:09.141
And what does he want you
to do with them?

01:09.208 --> 01:12.043
Well, I think he wants me
to take care of them for him.

01:13.812 --> 01:16.247
Ty: For how long? The winter?

01:16.315 --> 01:19.783
Amy: He didn't say.
He just said he wanted to talk.

01:19.851 --> 01:21.785
I think he needs my help.

01:21.853 --> 01:24.188
Ty: Doesn't Mr. Hanley always
need help with his horses?

01:24.256 --> 01:26.223
Amy: (Whispering) I know he
can be a bit of a weird guy,

01:26.291 --> 01:28.191
but what can I do?

01:28.259 --> 01:29.592
(Knocking)

01:31.429 --> 01:32.728
Ty: I'm gonna go check the barn.

01:32.796 --> 01:33.830
Okay.

02:06.862 --> 02:08.128
Well, you gotta get out
of a lawyer's office

02:08.197 --> 02:09.097

you know?

02:09.163 --> 02:10.431
The meter's always runnin'.

02:10.499 --> 02:11.599
Ah, I hear that.

02:11.666 --> 02:13.001
I'm just here
to sign some papers.

02:13.068 --> 02:14.302
My divorce
is almost final.

02:14.370 --> 02:16.436
Ha! Make sure
it's real this time.

Make sure

But, um, at least I can
get on with my life,

calls "closure."

02:31.751 --> 02:32.851
Closure?!

02:32.919 --> 02:34.120
Closure's just another
name for

02:34.187 --> 02:36.455
"you got shafted, buddy,
get over it."

02:36.523 --> 02:38.257
See ya.

02:56.975 --> 02:57.909
(Chuckles)
I'm sorry.

02:57.976 --> 03:00.045
This place gives me
the creeps!

03:00.112 --> 03:01.146
What? You still think
it's haunted?

03:01.213 --> 03:02.347
(Sighs) Maybe.

03:02.415 --> 03:03.680
Really?

03:03.748 --> 03:04.748
You remember that night
we spent here,

03:04.815 --> 03:05.749
where you thought
there was a ghost

03:05.816 --> 03:06.917
lurking in the shadows?

03:06.951 --> 03:07.918
Mm-hm.

03:07.985 --> 03:09.286
that was awesome.

03:09.354 --> 03:12.889
Yeah, awesome is probably
not a word I would use.

03:12.957 --> 03:14.591
Come on, let's go see
if Mr. Hanley's out back.

03:32.576 --> 03:33.709
It's weird.
He knew I was coming.

you mean you haven't seen
anything you've liked.

05:38.544 --> 05:40.678
Uh, no, you haven't liked
anything either.

05:40.746 --> 05:42.146
I'm a lot easier to please
than you are.

05:42.213 --> 05:44.280
It has nothing to do
with being easy to please.

05:44.348 --> 05:46.416
It's just really hard
to find the perfect house.

05:46.484 --> 05:48.017
Yeah, perfect being
the operative word

05:48.085 --> 05:49.152
in that sentence,
you see?

05:49.219 --> 05:50.520
Okay, it doesn't have
to be perfect,

05:50.588 --> 05:52.856
but everything we look at
is the same.

05:52.924 --> 05:55.425

06:28.858 --> 06:30.091
You promised to watch Katie.

I don't believe it.

06:43.404 --> 06:46.339
I know it's a real shock.

06:46.407 --> 06:48.040
Well, maybe if I'd just
come over last night...

06:48.108 --> 06:49.208
No, you couldn't have known.

06:49.275 --> 06:51.143
...When he called,
he'd still be here.

06:51.211 --> 06:52.778
Amy, you couldn't have
done anything.

06:52.846 --> 06:55.047
I put out some more water
and hay for the horses.

06:55.115 --> 06:56.482
They'll be good
till tomorrow.

06:56.550 --> 06:58.584
No, we're bringing
the horses to Heartland.

06:58.652 --> 07:00.653
Now, honey, we don't need
any more horses.

07:00.721 --> 07:02.421
Mister Hanley asked me
to care for them

07:02.489 --> 07:04.155
and I'm going to do that.

07:04.223 --> 07:06.057
It's the least I can do.

07:06.125 --> 07:08.026
We're gonna have to look after
more than just horses.

come in the house, please.

Amy: Grandpa.
Jack: Well, look at him.

07:36.020 --> 07:37.453
Hey, shh! Wait.
Wait'll you guys hear this.

07:37.521 --> 07:38.888
Wait'll you hear this.

07:38.956 --> 07:41.257
I had a meeting with
my stellar lawyer this morning.

07:41.324 --> 07:42.625
Tells me that even
if I had of won

07:42.693 --> 07:44.360
the Cowboy Association
presidency

07:44.428 --> 07:46.028
I still wouldn't gain custody.

07:46.095 --> 07:47.328
It wouldn't help
my case at all.

07:47.396 --> 07:48.764
<i>Jack:</i>
<i>Why is that?</i>

07:48.831 --> 07:52.200
Because apparently I have
to have a stable home life -

07:52.268 --> 07:53.201
<i>a stable home life! -</i>

07:53.269 --> 07:54.670
in order to gain custody.

07:54.737 --> 07:56.371
What is he talkin' about?!

07:56.439 --> 07:57.973
<i>What is he talkin' about?!</i>

07:58.041 --> 08:00.141
<i>I have a stable home life.</i>

08:00.209 --> 08:03.811
I mean, I am payin' this guy
for this crap advice!

08:03.879 --> 08:05.312
This is gettin' crazy!

08:05.380 --> 08:07.582
Jack: So just phone
Miranda and talk to her.

08:07.649 --> 08:08.983
No, no, that's a non-starter,
you see?

08:09.051 --> 08:10.417
He says if I do that

08:10.485 --> 08:13.520
she'll see it
as a sign of weakness.

08:13.589 --> 08:16.390
Amy, I'm really sorry
about Mr. Hanley.

08:16.458 --> 08:18.625
I'm really sorry
that you were the one that...

08:18.693 --> 08:20.359
It's fine, okay?

08:21.629 --> 08:23.563
Hey, uh...

08:23.631 --> 08:25.031
Do you think maybe
I could borrow

08:25.099 --> 08:27.200
your red truck and trailer
to go pick up his horses?

08:28.135 --> 08:30.403
Actually, you know what?
If we rode over there

08:30.471 --> 08:32.205
and then herded the horses back
through the field

08:32.272 --> 08:33.739
that might be easiser.

08:33.807 --> 08:34.907
<i>I would need help though.</i>

08:34.975 --> 08:36.274
I'm in.

08:36.342 --> 08:37.842
I can give you a hand
with that.

08:37.910 --> 08:39.244
Okay. Dad?

08:39.312 --> 08:41.145
Oh, well, honey,
I've got legal homework to do...

08:41.214 --> 08:43.448
Dad, I don't want
to put this off.

08:43.515 --> 08:44.517

08:44.585 --> 08:45.884
You're just gonna have to find
another way around it.

08:45.885 --> 08:46.986
Any other time.

09:02.066 --> 09:03.800
to completely screw things up
with Shane.

09:03.868 --> 09:06.569
He's totally obsessed.
It's all he can think about!

09:06.637 --> 09:07.803
Just relax.

09:07.871 --> 09:09.739
No! You know what,
he's driving me crazy!

09:09.806 --> 09:11.874
The horses will be fine
overnight, 'kay?

09:11.942 --> 09:13.676
We'll go out there
tomorrow.

09:13.744 --> 09:15.711
We don't have to do it
with Tim or Jack, okay?

09:15.779 --> 09:18.848
We'll do it by ourselves.
Okay?

09:20.017 --> 09:21.684
Okay.

09:21.752 --> 09:23.752
Sound like a plan?

09:24.052 --> 09:25.052
Yeah.

09:26.456 --> 09:28.390
(Groans loudly,
starts panting)

09:29.325 --> 09:31.493
Mrs. Bell:
Well, that's very sad news.

09:31.561 --> 09:33.162
Poor man.

09:33.329 --> 09:35.230
Mr. Hanley loved
that farm.

09:35.298 --> 09:38.599
He might not have taken
the very best care of it, but...

09:38.667 --> 09:40.168
You grew up there,
didn't you, Mrs. Bell?

09:40.235 --> 09:42.236
I was born there.

09:42.304 --> 09:44.505
I lived in that house
till I was sixteen.

09:44.573 --> 09:46.307
And you fell in love there,
right?

09:46.375 --> 09:50.611
With the ranch-hand Thomas,
until the... fire.

09:50.679 --> 09:51.612
I'm sorry, I-

09:51.680 --> 09:53.181
don't worry.

09:53.248 --> 09:54.947
It's fine to talk about
dear Thomas.

09:55.015 --> 09:57.784
It all happened
a very long time ago.

09:57.851 --> 09:59.819
But I hope whoever
buys the farm

09:59.887 --> 10:01.454
will take care of that
little cemetery.

10:01.522 --> 10:03.856
So many memories are there.

10:04.858 --> 10:06.726
You know, it's funny,

10:06.794 --> 10:09.262
my mother had a theory.

10:09.330 --> 10:12.331
She vowed that good news
was always followed by bad news.

10:12.399 --> 10:13.965
Huh. Uplifting.

10:14.934 --> 10:16.569
Why? Did you get
some good news?

10:16.636 --> 10:19.104
Wait'll you hear this!

10:19.172 --> 10:21.273
You know the accident
that I had

10:21.341 --> 10:23.275
at my sister's place
in Florida?

10:23.343 --> 10:25.444
You tripped over
a garden gnome?

10:25.512 --> 10:27.312
Little devil broke my hip.

10:27.379 --> 10:30.215
Well...

10:30.282 --> 10:32.116
I've had a bit
of a windfall.

10:32.184 --> 10:36.521
My sister's insurance company
has been very generous.

10:36.589 --> 10:38.256
(Laughs excitedly)

10:40.459 --> 10:42.326
(Dog whines)

10:42.393 --> 10:43.893
Amy:
What?

10:43.961 --> 10:45.662
What are you looking at?

10:45.730 --> 10:46.896
(Chuckling)
Hey?

10:47.865 --> 10:49.799
Well, what are we gonna
call you?

10:49.867 --> 10:51.935
What did Mr. Hanley call ya?

10:52.002 --> 10:54.538
You need a name?

10:56.107 --> 10:57.941
How about Lobo?

10:58.008 --> 11:00.509
It's from the Latin word "lupus"
meaning wolf,

11:00.577 --> 11:03.346
and he looks more like a wolf
than a dog to me.

11:03.413 --> 11:04.580
You know Latin.

11:04.648 --> 11:05.781
Well, not so much.

11:05.849 --> 11:07.816
I rode a bronc
named Lobo once.

11:07.884 --> 11:09.752
Won a buckle on him.

11:09.819 --> 11:11.254
Lobo.

11:11.321 --> 11:14.989
Anyway, the owner told me
about the story behind his name.

11:16.859 --> 11:17.959
Come here.

11:18.026 --> 11:20.595
Lobo it is.
(Chuckles happily)

11:21.264 --> 11:23.398
Lou: So we saw a house today
that was pretty good.

11:23.466 --> 11:24.432
Amy:
Yeah?

11:24.500 --> 11:25.567
Peter:
Mmm.

11:25.635 --> 11:26.934
Really good, actually.

11:27.002 --> 11:28.470
Lou:
Yeah, in fact,

11:28.537 --> 11:30.304
you'll be happy to know
that we've put in an offer.

11:30.372 --> 11:32.072
(Snorts)
Way to go.

11:32.140 --> 11:33.307
You finally stepped up
to the plate,

11:33.375 --> 11:35.442
did you, general?

11:35.510 --> 11:38.145
So with any luck
you'll be rid of us.

11:38.212 --> 11:39.346
You don't need to hurry up

11:39.414 --> 11:40.714
and find a house
for my benefit.

11:40.782 --> 11:42.616
You know you can stay here
as long as you like.

11:42.684 --> 11:44.017
Well, it's nice of you to say,

11:44.085 --> 11:45.919
but we've definitely
outstayed our welcome.

11:45.987 --> 11:47.253
(Chuckles)
You think?

11:47.321 --> 11:48.788
Amy: Dad!
Peter: Okay!

11:48.855 --> 11:50.423
How about you and I just step
outside and have a chat?

11:50.491 --> 11:51.991
You want to do that?

11:52.058 --> 11:53.593
<i>No, no, he's obviously</i>
<i>got something to say,</i>

11:53.661 --> 11:54.994
so why don't we go outside
and you can tell me what it is,

11:55.061 --> 11:55.795
'cause I'm getting pretty sick
of the attitude

11:55.862 --> 11:56.829
to be honest with you.

11:56.897 --> 11:59.365
Lou: Peter.
Tim: Come on.

11:59.433 --> 12:00.500
I...

12:05.237 --> 12:06.471
It's all right.

12:06.539 --> 12:07.773
It's okay.

12:08.741 --> 12:10.609
Sorry, Jack.

12:10.677 --> 12:12.877
Mr. Sensitive
can't take a joke.

12:12.945 --> 12:14.179
Wow!

12:14.246 --> 12:16.014
Amy: Seriously? (Fork clatters)

12:16.081 --> 12:17.248
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Guys, you know what?</i>

12:17.317 --> 12:18.683
<i>Amy's upset enough</i>
<i>about Mr. Hanley</i>

12:18.750 --> 12:20.484
without you two
going at it.

12:20.552 --> 12:21.519
(Phone buzzes)

12:23.087 --> 12:24.021
(Phone beeps)

12:24.088 --> 12:25.189
(Sighs)

12:27.192 --> 12:28.225
It's the real
estate agent.

12:28.293 --> 12:30.761
Um...
We didn't get it.

12:30.829 --> 12:32.196
<i>There's another offer</i>
<i>on the place</i>

12:32.263 --> 12:35.064
<i>and, uh, the seller</i>
<i>wants more money.</i>

12:35.132 --> 12:36.866
They think we should up
our offer.

12:36.934 --> 12:38.301
Excuse me.

12:50.347 --> 12:52.348
(Dog barks and howls mournfully)

12:54.851 --> 12:56.785
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>No, I don't think we should.</i>

12:56.853 --> 12:57.786
<i>Peter:</i>
<i>Well, I'm sorry, but I do.</i>

12:57.821 --> 12:59.054
Honey
putting in a higher offer

12:59.121 --> 13:01.189
is just gonna start
a bidding war, you know.

13:01.257 --> 13:02.758
Why don't we just
keep looking?

13:02.826 --> 13:04.960
The place wasn't
that great anyway.

13:05.027 --> 13:06.328
It wasn't that great?

13:06.395 --> 13:07.895
The house wasn't great,

13:07.963 --> 13:09.230
but it was great when we put
an offer in on it, right?

13:09.297 --> 13:10.631
But now it's not.
Honestly, Lou,

13:10.699 --> 13:11.632
you're making me crazy.

13:11.700 --> 13:13.334
How am I making
you crazy?

13:13.402 --> 13:14.769
'Cause you're looking for this
impossible dream house, honey.

13:14.837 --> 13:16.303
(Angry grunt)
That is not true!

13:16.372 --> 13:17.538
<i>(Door shuts)</i>
<i>Peter:</i> <i>Yes, it is!</i>

13:17.606 --> 13:18.806
<i>There's no house</i>
<i>that's good enough</i>

13:18.874 --> 13:20.408
<i>and, honestly,</i>
<i>i've just about had it!</i>

13:20.476 --> 13:21.409
<i>Lou:</i> <i>What do you mean</i>
<i>you've just about had it?</i>

13:21.477 --> 13:23.710
<i>What is that supposed to mean?</i>

13:23.778 --> 13:25.212
<i>Peter:</i> <i>I know Jack is
saying</i> <i>that we can stay here</i>

13:25.280 --> 13:26.413
<i>as long as we want,</i>

13:26.481 --> 13:27.547
but we both know
that underneath it all

13:27.615 --> 13:28.949
he wants us out, honey,

13:29.017 --> 13:31.252
<i>and I don't blame him</i>
<i>to be honest!</i>

13:31.319 --> 13:32.586
And I'm tired of getting
that look-

13:32.653 --> 13:34.554
Grandpa is not giving you
any look.

13:34.622 --> 13:36.090
That is in
your imagination.

13:36.157 --> 13:37.624
<i>Peter:</i> <i>Yes, he is.
</i> <i>You know what?</i>

13:37.692 --> 13:39.259
<i>It's the look that says,</i>
<i>"Peter, you're a grown man.</i>

13:39.326 --> 13:40.760
Put a roof over
your family's head."

13:40.827 --> 13:42.395
You are being
overly sensitive.

13:42.462 --> 13:45.031
Wow, my God,
you sound like your dad.

13:45.099 --> 13:46.966
I did not call you
Mr. Sensitive.

13:47.034 --> 13:48.301
I'm not sensitive.
You know what I am?

13:48.369 --> 13:51.004
I'm worn out, honey,
because they're right,

13:51.071 --> 13:52.171
and I know that
they're right.

13:52.239 --> 13:55.040
How do you think
that makes me feel?

13:55.108 --> 13:57.342
Okay, if we put in
a higher offer on this house,

13:57.410 --> 13:59.644
do we even have a chance
of getting it?

13:59.712 --> 14:01.780
(Exasperated sigh)

14:01.847 --> 14:03.015
We won't if we don't.

14:03.082 --> 14:06.018
Well, then let's put in
a higher offer.

14:06.085 --> 14:07.119
You said you didn't like
the house.

14:07.186 --> 14:08.653
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>No, I didn't!</i>

14:08.721 --> 14:10.822
<i>Peter:</i> <i>Yes, you did,</i>
<i>you said that.</i>

14:10.890 --> 14:13.991
<i>Lou:</i> <i>Okay, fine!
</i> <i>I like the house.</i>

14:14.059 --> 14:15.692
<i>I'm just not in love with it!</i>

14:15.760 --> 14:17.728
<i>(Lobo barks and howls outside)</i>

14:17.796 --> 14:20.231
<i>Lou:</i> <i>You know what?
I don't wanna</i> <i>talk about it any more!</i>

14:20.299 --> 14:24.068
Okay. Let's just go to bed.
Can we go to bed?

14:24.136 --> 14:25.669
Can we agree on that?

14:25.737 --> 14:28.371
Yes. That's a great idea.

14:42.820 --> 14:44.153
(Lobo grunts quietly)

14:46.156 --> 14:48.290
(Birds chirp and twitter,
rooster crows in the distance)

14:48.358 --> 14:49.691
<i>(Katie gurgles)</i>

14:49.759 --> 14:51.327
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>(Laughs)</i>

14:54.564 --> 14:55.264
Good morning.

14:55.332 --> 14:56.565
Morning!

14:56.632 --> 14:57.899
Do you need a hand
with anything?

14:57.968 --> 14:59.233
No, I'm good.

14:59.301 --> 15:01.602
You can come and hang out
with us though.

15:01.670 --> 15:03.371
Can Amy come and hang out
with us?

15:03.439 --> 15:05.639
(To Katie)
Good morning.

15:05.707 --> 15:07.008
There you go.

15:07.843 --> 15:09.577
I heard you and Peter
arguing last night.

15:09.644 --> 15:11.245
I hope you guys are okay.

15:11.313 --> 15:13.181
I'm sorry.
Did we wake you?

15:13.248 --> 15:15.315
Oh, just me and half
the population of Hudson.

15:15.383 --> 15:16.350
(Mortified grunt)

15:16.417 --> 15:18.185
Yeah, well,
let's just say

15:18.252 --> 15:19.919
I knew buying a house
would be stressful,

15:19.988 --> 15:21.721
but I didn't know
it would be this bad.

15:21.789 --> 15:23.290
You know you could always
just stay here.

15:23.358 --> 15:25.025
I kind of like
having you around.

15:25.093 --> 15:26.726
Well, if things keep going
the way they're going,

15:26.794 --> 15:28.761
you might
just get your wish.

15:28.829 --> 15:30.663
You are going to find
the perfect place.

15:30.731 --> 15:31.697
I know it.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.699
(Sighs)
Thanks.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.534
What about you?

15:35.602 --> 15:37.169
Are you okay?

15:37.237 --> 15:38.737
Yeah.

15:38.805 --> 15:40.139
I can't imagine
what it must have been like

15:40.207 --> 15:42.274
finding Mr. Hanley
like that.

15:42.342 --> 15:44.576
It hasn't really
sunk in yet.

15:44.644 --> 15:46.979
I'm trying not
to think about it.

15:47.046 --> 15:48.313
Well...

15:48.381 --> 15:49.947
Not everybody in Hudson
was kind to Mr. Hanley,

15:50.016 --> 15:52.950
but you were
a good friend to him.

15:53.019 --> 15:55.453
I just hope
I can help his horses.

15:55.521 --> 15:58.289
I have a feeling
they're in the right hands.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.359
(Truck rumbles)

16:04.329 --> 16:05.929
Amy: You know, I had to
sneak Lobo out this morning

16:05.997 --> 16:07.597
before Grandpa got up,
right?

16:07.665 --> 16:08.732
I had him in the house.

16:08.799 --> 16:10.401
But he's such a good dog!

16:10.468 --> 16:13.837
But-- ugh! Man, does he shed!

16:13.905 --> 16:15.639
You should have seen my bed.
It was covered with hair.

16:15.706 --> 16:17.107
He slept in your bed?

16:33.632 --> 16:35.935
<i>But Mr. Hanley asked me</i>
<i>to care for his horses</i>

16:35.972 --> 16:37.807
and I can't get in;
The gate's locked.

16:39.875 --> 16:41.308
Oh. Really.

16:42.477 --> 16:45.279
Okay. No, I understand.
Bye.

16:46.581 --> 16:48.015
The bank foreclosed.

16:48.083 --> 16:49.116
They're auctioning
everything off,

16:49.184 --> 16:51.451
including the horses.

16:55.356 --> 16:58.724
Jack: Lou, doesn't like it when
people touch her computer.

16:58.793 --> 17:02.262
Tim: Well, this is important stuff.
It's research; Custody cases.

17:02.579 --> 17:04.547
And guess what?
More good news.

17:04.614 --> 17:06.516
Jack:
Well, I can't wait to hear it.

17:06.583 --> 17:08.451
Tim: Even with all the
things I've been doing

17:08.519 --> 17:11.020
the court will still not view me
as a solid citizen.

17:11.088 --> 17:14.189
And do you wanna know why?
It's because of the "M" word.

17:14.323 --> 17:15.357
The "M" word?

17:15.425 --> 17:16.691
<i>Tim:</i>
<i>Yup.</i>

17:16.759 --> 17:18.393
Mom.

17:18.461 --> 17:20.127
Mother.

17:20.195 --> 17:21.963
<i>It doesn't matter whether</i>
<i>Miranda's a good mother or not.</i>

17:22.031 --> 17:25.434
Ninety per cent of all cases
are awarded to the mother.

17:25.501 --> 17:27.269
It's as if a guy
can't even be a good caregiver.

17:27.336 --> 17:29.403
Well, your history speaks
to that.

17:29.471 --> 17:31.405
You wanna know something else?

17:31.473 --> 17:33.740
It's even worse
if you're single.

17:33.808 --> 17:36.009
The highest rate
of custody cases are won

17:36.078 --> 17:38.479
by men who are remarried.

17:38.547 --> 17:40.347
Where did you come up
with that?

17:40.415 --> 17:42.450
My divorce website.

17:42.517 --> 17:46.352
Tim, get rid of the lawyer,
get rid of the bad research.

17:46.420 --> 17:49.855
Good old-fashioned communication
is what's needed here.

17:49.923 --> 17:51.824
Talk to Shane,
you talk to Miranda.

17:51.892 --> 17:53.159
I've been telling you that
the whole time,

17:53.227 --> 17:55.027
you just won't listen.

17:55.096 --> 17:57.130
I took your advice once,
Jack, and guess what?

17:57.198 --> 17:58.965
Miranda has a lawyer too

17:59.032 --> 18:01.467
<i>and he's advised her</i>
<i>not to talk to me.</i>

18:01.534 --> 18:04.369
So now she's not
taking my calls.

18:04.437 --> 18:06.004
It's a mess!

18:06.072 --> 18:07.072
Jack:
You made it.

18:17.216 --> 18:18.216
(Door opens)

18:24.756 --> 18:27.125
What's the matter
with you?

18:27.192 --> 18:31.462
I just got the final papers.
My marriage is officially over.

18:31.530 --> 18:34.364
Well, you're probably
better off for it.

18:34.432 --> 18:35.932
And I know I told you
that that woman

18:36.000 --> 18:38.701
was plenty good for you,
but...

18:38.769 --> 18:40.137
As it turns out,

18:40.204 --> 18:42.705
you were probably
a better man than she was.

18:42.773 --> 18:45.609
Than she was a woman,
I mean.

18:45.676 --> 18:48.744
It wasn't Ashley's fault.
It just kind of fell apart.

18:48.811 --> 18:50.246
Fine.

18:50.313 --> 18:53.149
Well, marriage isn't
a bad thing.

18:53.216 --> 18:56.051
Hell, if I met the right girl
I'd marry her tomorrow.

18:56.119 --> 19:00.523
Yeah, well...
You're an idiot.

19:00.590 --> 19:02.258
Come on,
give yourself a break, kid,

19:02.325 --> 19:04.126
you're young.

19:04.193 --> 19:05.293
Just take some time
before you jump

19:05.361 --> 19:08.163
back into the marriage pit,
huh?

19:08.230 --> 19:09.330
I guess.

19:09.398 --> 19:10.931
It's just I liked
being married though.

19:10.999 --> 19:13.268
Marriage,
it gives a guy roots.

19:13.335 --> 19:15.603
It makes him feel... solid.

19:16.605 --> 19:18.573
You believe that?

19:18.641 --> 19:20.041
Yes, I do.

19:24.412 --> 19:26.280
Well, cowboy up.

19:28.783 --> 19:30.016
Amy: Yeah, but how can
they just walk in there

19:30.185 --> 19:31.585
and claim those horses -

19:31.653 --> 19:33.720
the horses that Mr. Hanley
asked me to take care of?

19:33.788 --> 19:35.021
Ty:
It's wrong is what it is.

19:35.089 --> 19:36.489
Lou:
What about Mr. Hanley's sister?

19:36.557 --> 19:38.023
Amy: Well, she got married
and moved out east,

19:38.091 --> 19:39.792
and apparently she okayed it.

19:39.859 --> 19:41.760
Jack:
Well, that is a shame.

19:41.828 --> 19:43.862
What's gonna happen?
Is someone gonna bid on it?

19:43.930 --> 19:45.764
Jack: Oh, yeah, it's
all up for grabs.

19:45.832 --> 19:47.500
Peter: Yeah, it probably
won't go for much though.

19:47.568 --> 19:48.701
Developer'll snap it up.

19:48.768 --> 19:49.802
You think so?

19:49.869 --> 19:52.071
Mm-hmm.
It's prime real estate.

19:52.138 --> 19:54.138
They can divvy it up
into a bunch of smaller lots.

19:54.207 --> 19:55.873
Buy cheap, sell big.

19:55.941 --> 19:58.009
I'd think about doing it myself
if I had the extra cash,

19:58.077 --> 20:00.712
but I have a real house to buy.

20:06.852 --> 20:08.252
(Music plays in the diner)

20:08.320 --> 20:10.354
Mrs. Bell, thank you for meeting me.

20:10.422 --> 20:11.522
Oh, it's fine, dear.

20:11.590 --> 20:12.756
I had to come
into town anyway.

20:12.824 --> 20:14.558
You sounded very upset.

20:14.626 --> 20:15.826
I am.

20:15.893 --> 20:17.794
I have crucial
information.

20:17.862 --> 20:20.664
The Hanley farm,
it's going up for auction,

20:20.732 --> 20:23.434
and guess what I just heard
from a very reliable source.

20:23.501 --> 20:24.800
A developer's interested.

20:24.868 --> 20:26.068
That's exactly
what you were scared of!

20:26.136 --> 20:28.104
They're gonna plow over
that little cemetery.

20:28.171 --> 20:30.806
There'll be nothing left
of your Thomas!

20:30.874 --> 20:34.043
I shouldn't have said that.
I'm sorry.

20:34.111 --> 20:38.448
You have to do something.
We have to do something.

20:39.416 --> 20:43.252
I don't think there's
anything we can do.

20:44.186 --> 20:45.420
<i>Janice:</i>
<i>I gotta say, Tim,</i>

20:45.488 --> 20:46.988
I was kind of surprised
when you called.

20:47.056 --> 20:48.323
I feel like
you've been avoiding me

20:48.391 --> 20:49.491
the past few weeks.

20:49.559 --> 20:51.660
Tim:
Oh, no, no. No, I haven't.

20:51.728 --> 20:52.927
Well, I've been busy,

20:52.995 --> 20:54.162
but I've been thinking
about you a lot,

20:54.230 --> 20:55.330
a whole lot.

20:55.398 --> 20:57.331
Yeah?

20:57.399 --> 20:58.432
Yeah.

20:59.735 --> 21:02.270
Oh, it's so beautiful.

21:03.405 --> 21:05.773
Tim:
Yeah, special...

21:08.777 --> 21:10.544
And so are you.

21:12.380 --> 21:13.613
You are.

21:14.615 --> 21:15.948
Thank you.

21:18.653 --> 21:22.922
You know, I haven't been
the same since I met you.

21:22.990 --> 21:23.990
We've been business
partners

21:24.057 --> 21:27.260
and we've been
partner partners,

21:28.995 --> 21:30.862
we've had our ups
and downs...

21:30.930 --> 21:35.033
But I think I've come
to a realization that...

21:35.101 --> 21:38.870
I'd like to be more
than partners.

21:38.938 --> 21:42.508
Wait, what? What do you-
what do you mean?

21:43.810 --> 21:45.142
Tim: (Grimaces)
Janice: Are you...?

21:45.210 --> 21:47.412
Tim: No, I got this.
I got, no, I...

21:47.479 --> 21:49.079
Janice:
What are you-?

21:49.147 --> 21:50.214
Tim: No - agh!
- It's all right. That's- that's okay.

21:50.282 --> 21:51.382
I'll just do it-
I'll do it standing up,

21:51.450 --> 21:53.984
'cause I'm gonna say
the same thing anyway.

21:54.052 --> 21:55.186
(Deep inhale)

21:56.254 --> 21:58.088
Janice Wayne,

21:58.156 --> 22:00.390
will you...

22:00.458 --> 22:02.392
Marry me?

22:06.864 --> 22:08.031
It fits.

22:10.802 --> 22:12.469
So, what do you say?

22:12.537 --> 22:14.571
(Surprised exhale)

22:19.108 --> 22:23.412
I um... I...

22:23.480 --> 22:24.680
I say no.

22:25.649 --> 22:26.749
What?!

22:26.817 --> 22:28.951
No! No! You... why?

22:29.018 --> 22:31.354
Tim, I think it would
change us.

22:31.421 --> 22:32.554
I'm not sure that
I want that.

22:32.621 --> 22:33.921
No, no, no, no,
it would not change us, no.

22:33.989 --> 22:35.590
Yes, Tim, it would.

22:35.658 --> 22:37.225
You are right in the middle
of this whole custody battle.

22:37.292 --> 22:38.226
I just...

22:38.293 --> 22:39.527
I would rather wait

22:39.595 --> 22:40.795
until that's all settled,
you know?

22:40.863 --> 22:43.898
Well, that'll be-
it'll... that...

22:46.435 --> 22:47.635
(Exhales)

22:50.438 --> 22:53.107
It was so, so sweet.

22:54.042 --> 22:55.409
Thank you.

22:58.480 --> 22:59.513
Thank you.

23:04.674 --> 23:07.910
<i>(Birds chirp)</i>

23:07.978 --> 23:09.678
<i>Tim:</i> <i>So, you know,</i>
<i>if I was married,</i>

23:10.246 --> 23:11.179
like settled down,

23:11.247 --> 23:14.750
that would make a difference
in my case, right?

23:15.568 --> 23:17.001
What do you mean?

23:18.403 --> 23:19.770
R-right.

23:19.838 --> 23:21.238
It would look like a marriage
of convenience.

23:21.305 --> 23:23.707
Yeah, right.
Why would I do that?

23:23.775 --> 23:25.342
No, I'm not planning on
getting married

23:25.410 --> 23:27.043
to further my case.

23:27.111 --> 23:31.749
Oh! Who would do it, right?
Thanks. Thank you. Bye.

23:31.816 --> 23:33.750
Hey, did I just
dodge a bullet.

23:33.817 --> 23:36.753
Somebody up there
is looking after me.

23:36.820 --> 23:38.888
Mallory: Can you believe this?
It's so sad.

23:38.955 --> 23:40.890
This used to be
Mrs. Bell's home.

23:40.957 --> 23:43.225
This is where she grew up,
where she fell in love.

23:43.293 --> 23:46.061
Her lover gave her butterflies
in jars!

23:46.129 --> 23:48.998
What?
Why did he do that?

23:49.065 --> 23:50.365
Butterflies can't breathe
in a jar.

23:50.433 --> 23:52.100
There's not enough air
in there for them.

23:52.167 --> 23:53.635
That is beside
the point.

23:53.703 --> 23:55.604
This also used to be
Mr. Hanley's house,

23:55.671 --> 23:58.172
which is sad enough
in itself.

24:01.878 --> 24:03.378
Who are those guys?

24:03.446 --> 24:05.346
(Men converse quietly)

24:06.415 --> 24:08.215
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>They're livestock buyers.</i>

24:08.283 --> 24:10.651
You mean kill buyers.

24:10.719 --> 24:12.486
No, there is no way
I'm letting Mr. Hanley's horses

24:12.554 --> 24:15.289
go to a slaughterhouse.

24:16.257 --> 24:18.559
They want how much more?

24:18.627 --> 24:21.328
Okay. No, that's-
yeah, that's totally doable.

24:21.396 --> 24:22.429
And they want to keep
the chandelier

24:22.496 --> 24:23.730
that's in the front room,
right?

24:23.798 --> 24:25.197
Yeah, no worries there.
My wife hated it.

24:25.265 --> 24:26.699
Okay, no,
this is great news.

24:26.767 --> 24:28.034
Yeah, um,

24:28.101 --> 24:29.201
I can't sign it back
right away,

24:29.269 --> 24:30.937
'cause my wife's out,
but I'll call her.

24:31.004 --> 24:32.405
Yeah, thanks.

24:32.473 --> 24:34.407
I'm just returning
this computer.

24:34.475 --> 24:37.743
Great. I think we might
have a house!

24:37.811 --> 24:38.811
About time.

24:40.179 --> 24:42.748
Hey! Hi.
Hey! Hi.

24:42.816 --> 24:44.450
Janice:
Hey! Uh, can we talk?

24:44.517 --> 24:45.851
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

24:49.456 --> 24:50.956
(Door slams shut)

24:51.023 --> 24:52.491
(Sighs happily)

24:52.559 --> 24:54.391
<i>Tim:</i>
<i>So...</i>

24:54.460 --> 24:56.527
<i>W-what did you wanna</i>
<i>talk to me about?</i>

24:56.595 --> 24:57.895
<i>Janice:</i>
<i>Well... (Clears throat)</i>

24:57.963 --> 25:01.699
I've been thinking
and I've changed my mind.

25:02.868 --> 25:04.368
Changed your mind?

25:04.436 --> 25:05.803
Yeah.

25:05.871 --> 25:08.339
I would like to take you up
on your offer,

25:09.874 --> 25:12.375
that is if it's still
out there.

25:12.443 --> 25:14.678
Uh, what are you saying?

25:14.745 --> 25:16.245
What do you mean
what am I saying?

25:16.313 --> 25:17.981
I'm saying yes, Tim.

25:19.484 --> 25:21.918
Yes, I will marry you.

25:23.253 --> 25:26.154
(Nervous exhale) But the
custody thing and waiting...

25:26.222 --> 25:28.791
You know what?
That's not important.

25:28.859 --> 25:31.059
We'll fight it together.

25:32.061 --> 25:34.196
I want to be your wife.

25:35.131 --> 25:36.499
(Nervous exhale)

25:39.302 --> 25:40.669
What's the matter?

25:40.737 --> 25:42.637
Nothing.

25:42.705 --> 25:44.839
Well, say something.

25:50.012 --> 25:50.879
Tim:
(Stunned laugh)

25:50.946 --> 25:51.980
Janice:
(Laughs happily)

25:54.483 --> 25:55.950
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>So we signed it back...</i>

25:56.018 --> 25:57.918
I didn't offer quite as much
as we should have, but...

25:57.986 --> 25:59.386
It was the right thing
to do.

25:59.453 --> 26:01.622
<i>So, hopefully, with any luck,</i>

26:01.689 --> 26:03.089
tomorrow, we'll be
proud homeowners.

26:03.157 --> 26:05.492
Well, let's hope it
works out for you.

26:05.560 --> 26:06.793
<i>Janice:</i> <i>All right,</i>
<i>here comes another race horse</i>

26:06.861 --> 26:08.261
<i>down the race track!</i>

26:08.329 --> 26:10.797
Oh, it's so num, num,
num, num, num.

26:10.865 --> 26:11.999
It's so good.

26:12.066 --> 26:14.466
(Whispers)
Ah, is that so good?

26:15.802 --> 26:17.069
Tim:

26:18.138 --> 26:20.039
Janice: (Exhales) I love babies.

26:20.106 --> 26:21.373
It's so good.

26:21.441 --> 26:23.009
Oh, ju, ju-be, ju.

26:24.845 --> 26:28.380
So, um, I've made a decision.

26:28.448 --> 26:31.416
I'm gonna bid on those horses
tomorrow at the auction.

26:31.483 --> 26:32.817
<i>I know Mr. Hanley</i>
<i>wouldn't have wanted them</i>

26:32.885 --> 26:33.818
to go to a kill buyer,

26:33.886 --> 26:35.587
so I hope that's okay.

26:35.655 --> 26:36.821
I guess so.

26:36.889 --> 26:38.256
Just don't pay
too much for them.

26:38.323 --> 26:39.891
Amy: Well, I am gonna
outbid those other guys.

26:39.959 --> 26:41.893
Jack: Not if the price
goes sky high you're not.

26:41.961 --> 26:43.528
Lou: It's just important
to know when to quit.

26:43.596 --> 26:45.129
Amy:
Yeah, I know, I know.

26:45.197 --> 26:47.397
Janice: Okay, before you guys
put on the boxing gloves,

26:47.465 --> 26:51.368
I would love for everybody
to raise a glass.

26:51.436 --> 26:52.870
<i>(Clears throat)</i>

26:52.938 --> 26:54.271
<i>This is kind of exciting.</i>

26:54.338 --> 26:55.839
<i>(Clears throat)</i>

26:55.907 --> 26:58.442
Tim has asked me
to marry him.

27:00.579 --> 27:01.778
(Katie gurgles)

27:02.980 --> 27:05.281
<i>And... I...</i>

27:07.517 --> 27:08.885
She said...

27:08.953 --> 27:10.620
Well, at first I said no
and I gave him back the ring

27:10.688 --> 27:13.255
<i>and then I...</i>

27:13.323 --> 27:14.624
Said...

27:14.692 --> 27:15.692
Both:
Yes!

27:15.759 --> 27:17.093
Janice:
(Laughs happily)

<i>Yay.</i>

27:18.294 --> 27:19.861
<i>Tim:</i>
<i>(Chuckles)</i>

27:19.929 --> 27:21.429
So we're engaged.

27:22.899 --> 27:23.899
Big news.

27:25.534 --> 27:26.735
Cheers.

27:26.803 --> 27:27.769
(Overlapping "hmms",

27:27.837 --> 27:28.770
<i>Peter:</i>
<i>Congratulations.</i>

27:28.838 --> 27:29.738
<i>Janice:</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

27:29.806 --> 27:30.973
(Glasses clink)

27:33.759 --> 27:36.193
She's so beautiful, Lou.
She really is.

27:36.261 --> 27:39.129
Thanks.
Yeah, we think so.

27:40.131 --> 27:43.167
So... engaged.

27:43.235 --> 27:44.568
Yeah.

27:44.635 --> 27:47.905
Wow, this whole thing
has just been so out there.

27:47.973 --> 27:49.840
I must admit I had
a pretty sleepless night

27:49.907 --> 27:51.374
after your dad proposed.

27:51.441 --> 27:53.509
I was tossing and turning
like crazy.

27:53.577 --> 27:54.978
I just...

27:55.045 --> 27:56.112
I never really thought
I was the marrying kind,

27:56.180 --> 27:57.646
- you know?
- Yeah.

27:57.714 --> 28:00.783
But for Tim to make
such a huge step,

28:00.851 --> 28:02.919
and he was so romantic
about it,

28:02.987 --> 28:04.053
how could I say no?

28:04.121 --> 28:05.688
How could you?

28:05.756 --> 28:07.489
I just want you to know that
you played a really big part

28:07.556 --> 28:09.224
in my decision.

28:09.292 --> 28:10.525
Lou:
Me? Why?

28:10.593 --> 28:12.660
I mean, uh, how?

28:12.728 --> 28:14.029
I don't know,

28:14.097 --> 28:15.630
I just see how happy you are
in your marriage.

28:15.698 --> 28:19.935
Now you have this
amazing little baby girl.

28:20.003 --> 28:22.603
Made me change my mind,
see things differently.

28:23.571 --> 28:25.907
Are you out of your mind?
What were you thinking?

28:25.974 --> 28:27.875
On top of everything else
you're dealing with,

28:27.943 --> 28:29.643
you ask Janice
to marry ya?

28:29.711 --> 28:31.045
What?!

28:31.113 --> 28:32.546
What? We've been seeing
each other for a while now.

28:32.614 --> 28:33.781
We get along great.

28:33.848 --> 28:35.383
Why wouldn't I ask her
to marry me?

28:35.450 --> 28:36.918
<i>Do I have to have</i>
<i>a reason?</i>

28:36.985 --> 28:38.919
Please tell me
I'm wrong about this.

28:38.986 --> 28:41.821
You're trying to manufacture
the stable home life

28:41.889 --> 28:42.822
you've been going on-

28:42.890 --> 28:45.525
No! No!

28:46.493 --> 28:48.694
Not... (Sighs)

28:48.762 --> 28:51.064
I'm wrestling with it.

28:52.266 --> 28:54.266
I might have made a mistake.

28:54.334 --> 28:56.268
You know how you feel
when you are absolutely sure

28:56.336 --> 28:59.471
that you made
the right decision?

28:59.539 --> 29:01.140
That's how I feel.

29:01.207 --> 29:04.009
Honestly,
I couldn't be happier.

29:04.077 --> 29:06.946
Great.
That's-that's great.

29:09.249 --> 29:12.250
It means a whole new life
for me.

29:12.318 --> 29:14.953
A whole new life for us,
right?

29:30.682 --> 29:33.816
<i>Jack:</i> <i>Well, those horses look like</i>
<i>they're in pretty good shape.</i>

29:33.884 --> 29:36.218
Ty: Yeah, I checked them out.
They're sound.

29:36.286 --> 29:38.087
How much do you think
for the lot?

29:38.155 --> 29:41.057
Jack: I wouldn't go any higher than
a couple hundred bucks a head.

29:41.124 --> 29:42.558
Well, you got all registered,
did you?

29:42.625 --> 29:43.926
Yup.

29:43.994 --> 29:46.095
Now, remember,
you've got a limit.

29:46.163 --> 29:48.664
One thousand dollars
for the lot.

29:48.731 --> 29:50.565
- Grandpa.
- One thousand dollars.

29:51.633 --> 29:52.667
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

29:52.735 --> 29:55.369
Whoa!
Talk about fixer-upper.

29:55.437 --> 29:57.238
Amy: What are you doing here?
Did the offer come back?

29:57.306 --> 29:59.507
Nope, and they are
taking forever.

29:59.575 --> 30:02.844
I couldn't stand just waiting
around for the phone call.

30:02.912 --> 30:04.712
So anything good
in there?

30:04.779 --> 30:05.946
Well, I haven't really
looked yet.

30:06.014 --> 30:07.280
Okay, well,
good luck with the horses,

30:07.348 --> 30:09.282
but remember what I said,
do not-

30:09.350 --> 30:12.052
get carried away.
I know. Just relax!

30:12.120 --> 30:15.155
I am relaxed.
I am totally relaxed.

30:16.124 --> 30:17.390
Amy:
(Chuckles)

30:19.493 --> 30:22.195
(Grounds buzz with chatter)

30:24.832 --> 30:26.465
Auctioneer: Alrighty, gather
around, ladies and gentlemen,

30:26.533 --> 30:28.367
and have a look
at what we've got here.

30:28.435 --> 30:31.370
We are gonna sell five horses
from the Hanley estate.

30:31.438 --> 30:32.839
<i>Ready to go here.</i>

30:32.906 --> 30:34.941
And we are gonna sell them
on a buyer's choice,

30:35.008 --> 30:36.575
buyer's privilege basis.

30:36.643 --> 30:38.576
High bidder will have the right
to take one horse

30:38.644 --> 30:41.012
<i>or as many as he likes.</i>

30:41.080 --> 30:42.748
And where would we like to start
the auction, folks?

30:42.815 --> 30:44.649
One thousand dollars,
let's go.

30:44.717 --> 30:45.683
<i>All right,</i>
<i>here we go now...</i>

30:45.752 --> 30:47.418
(Quietly)
He's out of his mind.

30:47.486 --> 30:49.587
I'll have a ten hundred there,
let me hear 10, 10, 10.

30:49.655 --> 30:51.089
<i>Well, $900 can go now.</i>

30:51.157 --> 30:52.857

<i>Six hundred,</i>

30:54.392 --> 30:56.526
Surely not, folks.
A fine set of horses here.

30:56.628 --> 30:58.362
Five hundred dollars,
your choice.

30:58.396 --> 30:59.596
<i>Five hundred.</i>
<i>I'm at $500 here.</i>

30:59.664 --> 31:01.832
Now, 5, 4, 3.
I'm dead 300.

31:01.900 --> 31:03.333
Come on, folks,
$300 on 'em.

31:03.401 --> 31:05.469
How about $150?

31:05.536 --> 31:07.504
<i>One and a half! Thank you!</i>

<i>I'm at $225.</i>
<i>Now two is all...</i>

31:12.977 --> 31:14.410
I'll pay the extra.

31:14.478 --> 31:15.344
<i>Auctioneer:</i>
<i>At two and quarter and half.</i>

31:15.445 --> 31:17.147

31:17.214 --> 31:19.048
Now a quarter, quarter, quarter,

31:19.116 --> 31:20.183
<i>Let me see the quarter.</i>

31:20.251 --> 31:21.217
<i>I see the half,</i>

31:21.285 --> 31:22.551
About a half is all

31:24.454 --> 31:25.654

<i>Auctioneer:</i>
<i>Okay, folks,</i>

31:29.458 --> 31:31.093
we have gotten the five horses

31:31.161 --> 31:32.594
<i>We'll sell 'em as one lot.</i>

31:32.662 --> 31:35.563
<i>We're bid $1500 on 'em.</i>

Nineteen hundred!

31:47.475 --> 31:49.911
Two thousand for the lot!

31:49.978 --> 31:52.313
<i>Auctioneer:</i> <i>We're bid $2000

<i>Going once...</i>

31:57.151 --> 31:58.919
Going twice...

31:58.986 --> 32:03.123
And I sold the horses - $2000 -
to the one sir with a good eye.

32:03.191 --> 32:04.557
Amy:
Thank you.

32:04.625 --> 32:05.859
<i>Auctioneer:</i>
<i>And what's your number, sir?</i>

32:05.927 --> 32:06.993

32:08.762 --> 32:10.496
<i>Thank you, Grandpa.</i>

32:10.564 --> 32:12.098
Jack:
Don't mention it.

32:12.166 --> 32:13.799
Amy: You went way
over budget, though.

32:13.867 --> 32:15.134
I mean, you doubled it.

32:15.202 --> 32:16.135
Jack:
Yeah, I know.

32:16.203 --> 32:17.602
Ty:
Good one, Jack.

32:17.670 --> 32:19.839
Jack: Yeah, like I said,
don't mention it.

32:19.906 --> 32:21.373
Lou:
Amy!

32:21.441 --> 32:23.809
Can you imagine how gorgeous
this place used to be?

32:23.877 --> 32:26.212
God, it just has so much
character, you know?

32:26.279 --> 32:27.880
Good bones!

32:27.948 --> 32:29.848
I mean, you'd have to repaint
the whole thing, obviously,

32:29.915 --> 32:32.650
and put in window boxes,
fill them with flowers.

32:32.718 --> 32:36.821
Oh, there's even a tire swing
on an old apple tree out back.

32:37.389 --> 32:39.890
Somebody could really bring
this place to life.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.826
What are you saying, Lou?

32:41.893 --> 32:44.362
I said somebody,
not me.

32:44.429 --> 32:45.730
Then what's the card for?

32:46.797 --> 32:47.530
I don't know.

32:47.598 --> 32:50.266
I might bid on
a couple of things later.

32:59.343 --> 33:01.277
Mallory:
You came.

33:01.345 --> 33:03.512
And you registered.

33:03.580 --> 33:07.383
Mrs. Bell: Just in case there's a
memento I might want to bid on,

33:07.450 --> 33:10.386
but it's difficult
to see this.

33:11.354 --> 33:12.921
I know things are bound
to change,

33:12.989 --> 33:15.824
especially if what you say
about the developer is true.

33:15.892 --> 33:17.725
Oh, it's true.
He's here.

33:17.793 --> 33:19.627
You can't miss him.

33:19.695 --> 33:23.197
Well, I can't hold on
to the past

33:23.265 --> 33:25.700
and I'm much too old
to take on a farm.

33:25.768 --> 33:28.636
You'd have help though!
We would all help you!

33:28.704 --> 33:31.238
And remember you got
your windfall!

33:31.306 --> 33:33.240
You can't let this
horrible developer

33:33.308 --> 33:35.409
build monster homes
with above-ground pools

33:35.476 --> 33:38.478
and little square
backyards!

33:38.546 --> 33:40.346
I'm afraid it's just
not the right time

33:40.415 --> 33:42.549
in my life for it.

35:15.169 --> 35:16.704
Hi, Peter, what is it?
I'm uh...

35:16.771 --> 35:18.138
I'm kind of in
the middle of something.

35:18.206 --> 35:20.641
Lou, honey,
hey, good news!

35:20.709 --> 35:21.909
Our offer has been accepted.

35:21.977 --> 35:24.311
All we have to do
is sign the papers.

35:24.379 --> 35:25.812
<i>Auctioneer:</i>
<i>Okay, bid $420...</i>

35:25.880 --> 35:29.281
I can't- I can't hear you.
Where are you?

35:29.349 --> 35:31.250
Um...

35:31.318 --> 35:32.952
I'm at the Hanley auction.

35:33.020 --> 35:34.921
Oh, Peter, this house
is so great!

35:34.989 --> 35:36.055
Four-thirty-five!

35:36.123 --> 35:38.257
At the-?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

35:38.325 --> 35:39.826
Lou, what are you doing?
Are you bidding?!

35:39.894 --> 35:41.827
Are you bidding right now?!
Are you crazy?!

35:41.895 --> 35:42.794
Over here.

35:42.862 --> 35:44.530
Uh $445,000 is all.

35:44.597 --> 35:47.866
<i>Now $450,</i>
<i>now 55.</i>

35:47.934 --> 35:49.434
<i>Peter:</i> <i>Lou, Lou, Lou, stop!
</i> <i>Stop! Stop!</i>

35:49.502 --> 35:51.169
Our offer was accepted!
We have a house!

35:51.237 --> 35:53.271
No, no, no.
Peter, listen to me.

35:53.339 --> 35:55.473
<i>Auauctioneer:</i> <i>60 on it.</i>
<i>I'm at $45000,</i>

35:55.542 --> 35:56.875

<i>now 65.</i>

35:56.943 --> 35:57.675
<i>You missed your turn!</i>

35:57.743 --> 35:58.910
Damn it!

35:58.977 --> 36:00.377
<i>Peter:</i>
<i>Lou! Lou!</i>

36:00.445 --> 36:01.946
Are you still bidding?
I need you to talk to me now,

36:02.014 --> 36:02.747
<i>'cause it sounded like</i>
<i>you were bidding just now!</i>

36:02.814 --> 36:04.415
Honey,
just one second.

36:04.482 --> 36:05.650
<i>Peter:</i> <i>Listen to me!
</i> <i>The place is a mess!</i>

36:05.717 --> 36:06.884
It'll cost us a fortune
to fix it up!

36:06.952 --> 36:08.819
It's falling down!
We need to discuss this!

36:08.921 --> 36:12.156
I know, I know, I'm sorry,
but it's perfect.

36:12.223 --> 36:14.024
It has good bones!

36:14.091 --> 36:16.760
I'm at $475,
now we need $475,

36:16.827 --> 36:18.562
<i>go ahead, ma'am.</i>
<i>$480.</i>

36:18.629 --> 36:20.396
<i>I'm at $480,</i>
<i>now 85, now 85 there.</i>

36:20.464 --> 36:21.496
<i>Now $485, 90!</i>

36:21.565 --> 36:22.798
<i>Peter:</i>
<i>Lou!</i>

36:22.866 --> 36:24.567
This other guy
is going to get it.

36:24.634 --> 36:26.234
I can't let him
get it!

36:26.302 --> 36:27.870
Are you crazy?! Lou!

36:27.938 --> 36:30.005
Please, Peter,
I want this house.

36:30.073 --> 36:32.307
It's perfect.
We can fix it up.

36:32.375 --> 36:35.044
Fix it up? Fix it up?!
It's a tear-down!

36:35.111 --> 36:37.278
<i>Walk away, Lou, honey...</i>

36:37.345 --> 36:38.846
(Katie cries) Okay, you know what?
Katie's...

36:38.914 --> 36:41.348
Lou, I'm not asking you now,
I'm telling you, honey, okay?

36:41.416 --> 36:42.750
I'm telling you walk away.

36:42.818 --> 36:43.918
<i>Stop now, okay?</i>

36:43.986 --> 36:46.420
You can't tell me
what to do.

36:46.488 --> 36:47.855
<i>Peter:</i>
<i>Lou, Lou, stop!</i>

36:47.923 --> 36:49.958
Oh, sorry!
Oh, sorry, sorry.

36:50.025 --> 36:52.126
<i>And now 95, and now 95,</i>
<i>now $500,000 is all.</i>

36:52.194 --> 36:53.961
<i>Peter:</i>
<i>Lou!</i>

36:54.028 --> 36:55.028
(Katie cries) Our offer has been
accepted on the other house, okay?

36:55.096 --> 36:56.029
Do you understand?

36:56.097 --> 36:57.230
Yeah, but, but, Peter,

36:57.298 --> 36:58.832
this one could be
so much better!

36:58.900 --> 37:01.234
<i>Yes, it will take some work,</i>

37:01.302 --> 37:02.569
a lot of work,

37:02.637 --> 37:05.472
but, but you could do it!
We can do it!

37:05.539 --> 37:07.007
<i>Auctioneer:</i>
<i>Yes, ma'am, I've got your bid.</i>

37:07.075 --> 37:08.075
<i>Peter:</i>
<i>Lou, stop!</i>

37:08.142 --> 37:09.075
Auctioneer:
Anybody else? $495.

37:09.142 --> 37:10.409
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Please, Peter.</i>

37:10.477 --> 37:12.144
This is the first house
I have really loved.

37:12.212 --> 37:14.146
<i>I don't know why exactly,</i>
<i>but I do.</i>

37:14.214 --> 37:16.682
And I can see us here.
I really, really can.

37:16.750 --> 37:19.151
Auctioneer:
Going twice... and sold!

37:19.219 --> 37:20.252
What?!

37:20.320 --> 37:23.723
Ma'am, you bought it!
$495,000.

37:23.790 --> 37:26.390
<i>Buyer number 137.</i>
<i>A good eye to you!</i>

37:26.458 --> 37:28.860
Mrs. Bell:
(Laughs excitedly)

37:30.129 --> 37:31.195
Mrs. Bell?!

37:37.436 --> 37:39.004
Hey, what'd I miss?

37:39.071 --> 37:42.039
You gotta be kidding me.

37:42.107 --> 37:43.007
(Sighs)

37:46.407 --> 37:47.707
Janice:
<i>So I've been thiking about that.</i>

37:48.739 --> 37:51.374
<i>I think I might want</i>
<i>to quit jockeying.</i>

37:51.442 --> 37:53.376
Tim:
Why?

37:53.444 --> 37:55.445
Janice: I feel like I might
want to settle down.

37:55.512 --> 37:56.713
Tim:
Settle down?

37:56.780 --> 37:58.047
Why would you want
to settle down?

37:58.114 --> 38:00.982
I don't know, Tim,
to have kids.

38:01.050 --> 38:02.484
(Chuckles) Kids.

38:02.552 --> 38:05.053
Yeah, I want...
I want a baby.

38:05.120 --> 38:06.621
No, no, I got enough kids.
No kids.

38:06.689 --> 38:08.189
Come on, Tim,
hear me out.

38:08.257 --> 38:09.725
Tim:
No, seriously.

38:09.792 --> 38:11.926
I'm still trying to get
custody of a kid.

38:11.994 --> 38:13.495
No more kids.

38:13.563 --> 38:16.296
You know, now that I'm a stable,
married, grounded guy,

38:16.365 --> 38:18.599
I'm gonna have Shane
half the year anyway.

38:18.667 --> 38:20.934
You can mother him
all you want.

38:21.002 --> 38:23.537
A stable, married,
grounded guy?

38:23.605 --> 38:25.005
Yeah. What?

38:25.940 --> 38:27.708
I don't know,
that kinda sounds like something

38:27.776 --> 38:29.176
your lawyer would say.

38:29.244 --> 38:30.778
Yeah.

38:30.846 --> 38:32.545
No, no, no, listen.

38:32.613 --> 38:34.914
No, my lawyer told me
not to get married

38:34.982 --> 38:36.082
to win a custody battle.

38:36.149 --> 38:37.350
He advised against it

38:37.418 --> 38:38.785
because it would look
convenient so-

38:38.853 --> 38:40.353
So you did talk
to your lawyer

38:40.421 --> 38:41.888
about the pros and cons
of marriage.

38:41.955 --> 38:43.222
This is a lawyer thing.

38:43.290 --> 38:44.223
Yes.

38:44.291 --> 38:45.224
No! No! No!

38:45.292 --> 38:46.225
Wow.

38:46.293 --> 38:47.226
No, no!

38:47.294 --> 38:49.127
No, listen, uh...

38:50.062 --> 38:51.062
How stupid of me.

38:51.130 --> 38:52.398
I thought you wanted
to marry me

38:52.465 --> 38:53.899
because you loved me,

38:53.966 --> 38:56.134
not because you were trying
to win some custody battle!

38:56.202 --> 38:57.302
I do.

38:57.370 --> 38:59.638
(Hard slap,
Tim groans in pain)

39:04.943 --> 39:07.745
Tim:
Janice, it's not like that!

39:07.813 --> 39:08.880
It's not like that!

39:08.947 --> 39:10.080
(Water runs)

39:11.983 --> 39:13.050
(Door shuts)

39:15.554 --> 39:16.821
Real estate agent called.

39:16.889 --> 39:18.055
We missed the deadline
to sign back

39:18.123 --> 39:19.489
the offer for the house

39:19.557 --> 39:22.459
and someone else put one in
so, uh, it got accepted.

39:22.527 --> 39:24.160
The house is gone,
just so you know.

39:24.228 --> 39:25.261
I'm sorry.

39:26.697 --> 39:27.898
I just I can't believe

39:27.965 --> 39:28.998
you wouldn't think
that you should discuss

39:29.066 --> 39:30.767
something like that
with me first.

39:30.835 --> 39:33.269
I said I'm sorry,
okay?

39:33.337 --> 39:35.504
I just got carried away.

39:35.572 --> 39:37.440
But, honey,
I loved that house.

39:37.507 --> 39:38.908
I really, really did.

39:38.975 --> 39:40.242
And I can't believe
Mrs. Bell

39:40.310 --> 39:42.845
just snatched it out
from under me like that.

39:42.913 --> 39:45.314
I mean, what does she need
another house for?

39:45.381 --> 39:46.882
She's not the one
raising a family.

39:46.950 --> 39:48.984
She's not the one
who needs a home.

39:49.052 --> 39:53.154
Peter: Honey, it wouldn't
have worked, trust me.

39:53.221 --> 39:54.923
It's so much harder
than building from scratch.

39:54.990 --> 39:56.791
No! No! I disagree!

39:57.760 --> 39:59.594
You never saw what
the dude ranch looked like -

39:59.662 --> 40:01.563
those shacks -
before I rebuilt.

40:01.630 --> 40:03.832
I did that from nothing
and look at it now.

40:03.899 --> 40:05.767
I mean, I could envision
what it could be like,

40:05.835 --> 40:07.201
I could see it,

40:07.269 --> 40:09.837
and that's how I felt
about the Hanley place.

40:09.904 --> 40:11.304
I could see
what it would be like

40:11.372 --> 40:14.875
once you and I fixed it up
and lived in it and...

40:14.943 --> 40:17.978
There's even an old tire swing
on the tree out back.

40:18.045 --> 40:20.981
You know, Katie would
have loved that thing.

40:21.048 --> 40:23.683
(Tearful)
It was perfect.

40:24.751 --> 40:25.685
Come here.

40:26.653 --> 40:28.020
(Door creaks open)

40:31.658 --> 40:34.460
<i>Mrs. Bell:</i>
<i>I am so sorry, Lou.</i>

40:34.528 --> 40:35.995
I'm sorry too,

40:36.062 --> 40:38.263
but I'm the one who talked
Mrs. Bell into it.

40:38.331 --> 40:41.533
<i>Mrs. Bell:</i> <i>Believe me, I had no
idea</i> <i>you were bidding on the farm.</i>

40:41.601 --> 40:42.968
I didn't see you.

40:43.035 --> 40:44.469
<i>I was so intent on bidding</i>

40:44.537 --> 40:46.638
<i>against that horrible</i>
<i>developer man -</i>

40:46.706 --> 40:48.239
I didn't want him
to get it -

40:48.307 --> 40:50.942
I guess I got
carried away.

40:51.010 --> 40:53.044
I hope you understand.

40:53.112 --> 40:55.346
I'm fine.
It's fine.

40:55.414 --> 40:57.214
No, it isn't.

40:57.281 --> 41:00.183
I didn't know how much
the farm meant to you.

41:00.251 --> 41:03.420
This is how it looked
when I was growing up.

41:03.488 --> 41:05.523
Oh...

41:05.590 --> 41:06.757
It's beautiful.

41:08.159 --> 41:09.192
See?

41:09.260 --> 41:10.895
Peter:
Yeah.

41:10.962 --> 41:12.562
<i>Mrs. Bell:</i>
<i>Yes, it is.</i>

41:12.630 --> 41:14.564
And it can look
that way again

41:14.632 --> 41:17.934
and you young people have
the energy to do it.

41:18.002 --> 41:19.201
What?

41:19.269 --> 41:21.170
I've made a decision.

41:21.238 --> 41:23.039
I want you and Peter
to live there.

41:24.241 --> 41:25.642
Peter:
(Chuckles nervously)

41:25.709 --> 41:28.076
No, Mrs. Bell,
you won the bid.

41:28.144 --> 41:29.511
Yes, I did,

41:29.579 --> 41:32.380
and I had a little
windfall money to do it,

41:32.448 --> 41:35.617
but I can't take care
of a place like that.

41:35.685 --> 41:38.720
I can barely take care
of my own tiny house.

41:38.788 --> 41:40.155
So I want to sell it
to you and Peter

41:40.222 --> 41:41.423
for what I paid.

41:43.625 --> 41:45.726
It'll be all business-like

41:45.794 --> 41:47.762
and we'll work out
a series of payments

41:47.829 --> 41:50.031
that you can afford.

41:51.867 --> 41:53.768
What do you say?

41:53.835 --> 41:55.903
Really?
Mrs. Bell, are you sure?

41:55.971 --> 41:57.538
I'm very sure.

41:57.606 --> 42:00.173
I love the idea of you and Peter
raising a family

42:00.240 --> 42:02.542
in the home where I grew up,

42:02.610 --> 42:05.545
and I think Mr. Hanley
would like it too.

42:05.613 --> 42:06.646
(Sighs)

42:09.016 --> 42:11.417
Is this what you want?

42:12.620 --> 42:13.653
Yes.

42:16.022 --> 42:16.988
All right.

42:16.996 --> 42:18.857
(Exhales happily)

42:18.925 --> 42:20.425
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Mmm! Thank you!</i>

42:20.493 --> 42:21.860
Mmm! (Kiss)

42:22.829 --> 42:23.796
Thank you!

42:25.799 --> 42:27.165
<i>Come here.</i>

42:28.635 --> 42:31.003
You just have to promise
not to mess with the cemetery.

42:31.571 --> 42:32.636
- Deal.
- Okay.

42:37.275 --> 42:39.376
Jack: (Whistling) Move up there, horse!
Move up there!

42:39.444 --> 42:40.478
Amy:
(Whistles) Hup!

42:40.545 --> 42:42.279
Jack:
Get up!

42:42.347 --> 42:44.582
Ty: (Whistling)
Yup! Get up there!

42:44.649 --> 42:46.484
Amy: Come on, Lobo! (Whistles)

42:46.551 --> 42:49.319
(Horse whinnies,
Lobo barks)

42:49.386 --> 42:52.655
<i>Jack:</i> <i>Well, that's not such
a bad dog</i> <i>after all, Amy.</i>

42:52.723 --> 42:53.923
Do you think maybe he could
come in the house

42:53.991 --> 42:55.925
just once in a while?

42:55.993 --> 42:59.161
He spends every night
in your room, doesn't he?

42:59.229 --> 43:01.363
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Yup! Come on!</i>

43:01.431 --> 43:03.198
(Amy laughs)

43:04.967 --> 43:06.301
(Horses whinny)

43:07.537 --> 43:08.903
(Horse whinnies)

43:11.707 --> 43:13.040
(Hooves thunder)

43:13.975 --> 43:15.343
(Horse whinnies)

43:47.974 --> 43:49.341
(Horse whinnies)

43:57.217 --> 43:58.116
Caleb:
What's up?

43:58.185 --> 43:59.451
Tim:
Nothin'.

43:59.519 --> 44:01.153
What's up with you?

44:03.222 --> 44:04.289
You okay?

44:06.125 --> 44:07.759
