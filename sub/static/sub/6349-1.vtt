43:03.240 --> 43:06.073
l'm burning inside to touch you, baby.

43:22.560 --> 43:25.279
MAN: How do you feel about
your granddaughter becoming a Drapette?

43:25.360 --> 43:28.193
-Mrs. Vernon-Williams, a picture, please.
-Please, no pictures.

43:34.880 --> 43:38.236
-Get your sloppy paws off me!
-Let go of me!

43:56.560 --> 43:59.996
Order. Order in this courtroom.

44:00.720 --> 44:03.439
What a sad vision of today's youth.

44:03.920 --> 44:07.071
The juvenile authorities have had it
with Drape gangs.

also known as Hatchet-Face.

44:16.520 --> 44:18.556
You are blights on this community.

44:19.040 --> 44:21.759
-Are the parents here?
-Yes, Your Honour.

44:22.480 --> 44:24.994
We have been praying all night for our son.

44:25.120 --> 44:27.588
And praying so hard that we got headaches.

44:28.640 --> 44:29.914
Hi, Wanda honey.

44:30.480 --> 44:32.471
You were on the radio.

44:32.600 --> 44:34.955
Would you just get me the fuck out of here?

44:35.040 --> 44:36.598
What does ''fuck'' mean, Hector?

44:36.680 --> 44:40.992
lt's just a teen nonsense word Wanda uses
to make herself feel all grown-up.

44:41.920 --> 44:44.957
Your Honour,
could we take Wanda the fuck home?

44:51.240 --> 44:52.514
Good God!

44:52.800 --> 44:56.315
Order. Order in this courtroom.

44:56.760 --> 44:58.478
You hear that, Your Honour?

44:58.800 --> 44:59.915
lt's a sign.

45:01.120 --> 45:02.872
She is speaking in tongues.

45:03.240 --> 45:06.198
God is in her gullet. And he is in yours, too.

45:07.560 --> 45:10.950
Let him out.
Let the words of the Saviour be heard.

45:18.120 --> 45:20.315
Order!

45:20.720 --> 45:23.359
No wonder your children are in trouble.

45:24.280 --> 45:26.157
And you, Miss Malnorowski....

45:26.640 --> 45:29.677
By the way, that's a shame about your face.

45:30.080 --> 45:32.594
There's nothing the matter with my face.

45:32.960 --> 45:35.110
l got character.

45:36.000 --> 45:39.356
l see that your parents haven't taken
the trouble to come to get you.

45:39.440 --> 45:42.034
Oh, yes, we did.

45:42.960 --> 45:46.555
You happy now, Mona? You finally did it.

45:46.720 --> 45:49.439
You put your own mother in an iron lung.

45:49.520 --> 45:53.957
Mrs. Malnorowski,
there is no smoking in this courtroom.

45:54.400 --> 45:55.674
Why not?

45:55.760 --> 45:58.479
l pay taxes on cigarettes, don't l?

45:58.840 --> 46:03.197
And what do l get for those taxes?
Happiness? Hell, no.

46:03.320 --> 46:05.754
l get tuberculosis.

46:08.360 --> 46:11.909
Christ! Now l got a flat tyre.

46:13.240 --> 46:17.074
l'm going to release these delinquents
to their parents' custody.

46:17.440 --> 46:19.237
And if they were mine...

46:19.320 --> 46:21.754
l'd give them a bare-assed whipping.

46:24.920 --> 46:27.957
They can sing, Your Honour.
You should hear them.

46:28.480 --> 46:30.232
lt's new, it's exciting.

46:30.320 --> 46:33.915
We don't know what to call it.
lt sort of rocks, man, it spins.

46:34.080 --> 46:36.355
Let me get the right words. lt twirls.

46:36.440 --> 46:40.149
Ramona and Belvedere Rickettes,
l find you guilty of disturbing the peace...

46:40.240 --> 46:43.676
and l fine the both of you $1,000.

46:44.880 --> 46:47.838
-That's all we have.
-How are we supposed to live?

46:49.720 --> 46:52.951
Damn you. Handcuff those brats.

46:53.040 --> 46:54.871
Don't touch my children.

46:54.960 --> 46:56.279
And you, Pepper Walker...

46:56.360 --> 46:58.237
l'm going to have your two children...

46:58.320 --> 47:01.357
put in the custody
of the Chatterbox Orphanage...

47:01.680 --> 47:04.752
until they're adopted
by God-fearing parents...

47:04.880 --> 47:07.189
who at least will give them Christian names.

47:07.280 --> 47:10.750
Not my children. They're my
flesh and blood. They're all l have!

47:11.640 --> 47:13.073
Get away from them.

47:15.800 --> 47:17.518
Don't you touch them kids!

47:25.760 --> 47:29.070
Wade Walker, better known as Cry-Baby...

47:29.240 --> 47:31.800
what a sad and silly name for a young man.

47:32.600 --> 47:35.398
You were the ringleader
in tonight's gang war.

47:36.400 --> 47:39.358
Grandmother, help him.
We were just singing together.

47:40.680 --> 47:43.558
Judge, let Allison go
and l'll take the full blame.

47:44.120 --> 47:46.111
l didn't mean no harm,
Mrs. Vernon-Williams.

47:46.200 --> 47:48.919
l may be a Drape,
but l love your granddaughter.

47:49.000 --> 47:52.834
And if that's a crime,
l'll stand convicted, ma'am.

47:55.080 --> 47:58.470
Your Honour, l am Allison's grandmother.

48:00.720 --> 48:05.077
And if Mr. Walker does have musical talent...

48:05.440 --> 48:08.432
l am willing to give him a second chance.

48:08.960 --> 48:12.270
Won't you? The boy is at least polite.

48:12.760 --> 48:14.398
Mrs. Vernon-Williams...

48:14.680 --> 48:18.514
are you aware that Negroes
were present at tonight's disturbance?

48:19.160 --> 48:23.312
My granddaughter
is fond of all kinds of music.

48:24.960 --> 48:27.633
l am going to release Allison this one time...

48:29.120 --> 48:33.352
because you are a fine
and beautiful woman, Mrs. Vernon-Williams.

48:37.280 --> 48:39.396
But not you, Cry-Baby Walker.

48:39.640 --> 48:42.200
The only place you're going to sing
is in jail.

48:42.280 --> 48:43.315
No!

48:44.480 --> 48:48.268
l find you guilty
of rampant juvenile delinquency...

Boy, do l have a story for you.

49:23.800 --> 49:25.870
How does it feel to be a juvenile delinquent?

49:25.960 --> 49:29.111
lt feels good.
l've never been so happy in my whole life.

49:29.960 --> 49:31.712
Lenora, you filthy hag.

49:31.800 --> 49:34.712

Allison's my girl.

49:34.800 --> 49:36.836
A-L-L-l-S-O-N, fellows.

49:37.080 --> 49:38.672
When did he propose?

49:39.640 --> 49:40.993
Just last night.

49:41.080 --> 49:43.958
You see, l'm pregnant with his child.

49:44.280 --> 49:46.794

Since Mabel ran off with Tom

Before she came on the scene

58:55.760 --> 58:58.354
But I don't seem to qualify

59:00.080 --> 59:02.196
I'm just out for a little fun

59:02.280 --> 59:04.669
But I'm guilty till I'm 21

Now, I can't let the right thing
stand in my way

59:39.720 --> 59:42.029
Someday, baby, I'll know better

59:42.240 --> 59:44.629
But right now I'm making them pay

59:50.560 --> 59:52.949
What do I do, who do I thank?

59:53.040 --> 59:55.315
What can I do?

Well, I was out for a little fun

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:25.800
I guess I'm guilty till I'm 21

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:28.599
I must be doing time for being young

she's brought us from her native land.

and learn something about a foreign culture.

Do we have a surprise for you.
Don't we, Meg?

01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:40.433
We sure do.

'cause it sure feels good

01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:54.948
Baldwin, please. Be a gentleman
and call off this race, it's too dangerous.

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:58.112
You were born a Square
and you're gonna die a Square.

01:19:58.200 --> 01:19:59.838
You're coming with me.

01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:05.877
[Singing] Stand back, look out
We're renegade teens

01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:08.235
Friends of the devil
But twice as mean

01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:10.914
We're looking for kicks
We want them now

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.434
We're gonna get them
And we don't care how

01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:15.476
We're high school hellcats

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:17.028
High school hellcats

01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:18.314
Almost grown

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:20.868
Come on, pick a fight
We wish you would

01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:23.599
We love being bad
'Cause it sure feels good

01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:33.234
Come on!

01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:49.989
[Singing] Well, you lock us up
in your schools

01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:52.389
We weren't born to live by rules

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:55.631
-Get down from there this minute.
-Sit down, you traitor.

01:20:55.720 --> 01:20:58.871
When you say stop, I say go
We're high school hellcats

01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:00.279
On our own

01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:04.154
What are you doing?

01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:05.275
Wish you would

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:07.874
We love being bad
'Cause it feels so good

01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:25.430
USA, the land of the free

01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:27.988
We should be what we want to be

01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:30.435
But everyone says we should be like them

01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:33.273
But we're high school hellcats
and we never fit in

01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:34.679
We're high school hellcats

01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:37.194
Allison, help! Help me!

01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:40.588
CRY-BABY: [Singing] Come on
and pick a fight, we wish you would

01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:43.399
We love being bad
'cause it sure feels good

01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:45.391
We're high school hellcats

01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:47.472
We're high school hellcats

01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:51.000
Come on and pick a fight,
we wish you would

01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:53.799
We love being bad
'cause it sure feels good

01:21:56.440 --> 01:21:57.759
Turn the wheel!

01:21:57.840 --> 01:21:59.512
'cause it sure feels good

01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:01.348
Chicken!

01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:44.431
[Soulful '50s music]
