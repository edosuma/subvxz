00:43.246 --> 00:45.563
Kent Brockman here for the channel: 
"Storm watching the 6" 

00:45.726 --> 00:48.140
Professor Fink, y he 
a scientific explanation 

00:48.295 --> 00:50.584
this severe storm? 

00:50.758 --> 00:52.090
Kent, we, um, 

00:52.448 --> 00:54.616
two theories 
to explain this. 

00:54.899 --> 00:57.571
A: We are in an area 

00:57.741 --> 00:59.486
very high pressure 

00:59.666 --> 01:03.343
or B: God plays bowling. 

01:03.503 --> 01:05.837
With the balls, bowling, 
Shoe rental, 

01:06.012 --> 01:10.114
very bad pizza 
cheese served in square shares. 

01:10.323 --> 01:12.876
Krusty, what is your opinion 

01:13.023 --> 01:14.383
on this very bad time? 

01:14.538 --> 01:18.227
Kent Sorry, I sold all my 
inthe weather jokes to Jay Mohr. 

01:18.430 --> 01:20.801
But I can make sounds funny 
in your microphone. 

01:20.999 --> 01:21.712
Very good. 

01:26.688 --> 01:27.591
So much for you. 

01:38.305 --> 01:40.643
Homer, do something 
for the leak. 

01:40.812 --> 01:42.050
Do not worry margin. 

01:42.212 --> 01:43.903
Hot Wheels to the rescue! 

01:44.131 --> 01:46.123
The water comes from here 

01:46.277 --> 01:47.491
pass line 

01:47.658 --> 01:49.211
few turns 
S tight, 

01:49.373 --> 01:51.132
the looping of death, 

01:51.132 --> 01:52.738
and exit through 
lunge for mail. 

01:52.948 --> 01:55.876
And that is the problem of the garden. 
- My hamster! 

02:09.130 --> 02:09.876
You know Homer, 

02:10.035 --> 02:11.730
I let go 
a lot of things, 

02:11.907 --> 02:14.632
but when you can not 
keep the roof over your family 

02:14.783 --> 02:16.531
you're really a father. 

02:16.710 --> 02:20.419
My classmates were 
come for a party special duties, 

02:20.432 --> 02:22.414
but now my 
Refreshments are ruined. 

02:22.481 --> 02:23.896
I can say goodbye to college! 

02:25.667 --> 02:28.721
It should participate in a contest 
this week. 

02:29.924 --> 02:31.309
It might not happen. 

02:37.577 --> 02:41.187
The teddy bear had survived 
three points of safety. 

02:41.354 --> 02:42.566
But he did not survive you! 

02:42.825 --> 02:44.439
Enough is enough. 
I'm going to Moe! 

02:45.952 --> 02:47.462
Oh, it's raining outside. 

02:47.695 --> 02:49.009
It also rains inside! 

02:53.618 --> 02:55.121
Chat seedy. 

02:57.886 --> 02:59.491
Stupid family hates Homer. 

02:59.652 --> 03:01.782
At least, it remains a place where 
I am always welcome. 

03:01.979 --> 03:04.608
For him, which is a good friend ... 

03:04.800 --> 03:06.029
Oh, guys. 

03:06.203 --> 03:07.702
This is what 
I needed. 

03:07.880 --> 03:09.236
It's not for you big stupid. 

03:09.435 --> 03:10.950
It is a feast 
Lenny surprise, 

03:11.135 --> 03:12.288
Organized by 
closest friends. 

03:12.467 --> 03:14.197
So what does Stephen Hawkins here? 

03:14.431 --> 03:15.704
I live here now. 

03:15.886 --> 03:17.599
I am the new owner 

03:17.768 --> 03:19.759
the "Little Caesar's" 
down the street. 

03:20.339 --> 03:22.186
Pizza, pizza. 
Pizza, pizza. 

03:24.701 --> 03:26.701
Sorry, this button jammed. 

03:26.847 --> 03:28.221
But why you 
not invite me? 

03:28.360 --> 03:29.836
You could not tell you in advance 

03:29.869 --> 03:30.974
t'aurais unable to maintain secrecy. 

03:31.122 --> 03:33.177
I will never ruin 
Lenny surprise. 

03:33.348 --> 03:35.251
Surprise? What a surprise? 

03:37.804 --> 03:39.067
Well done, 
Homer. 

03:39.245 --> 03:41.820
Six years 
preparation torpedoed. 

03:41.988 --> 03:42.864
I'm sorry. 

03:43.041 --> 03:45.800
I will here m'assoir 
until you calm. 

03:47.135 --> 03:48.000
Homer great! 

03:48.001 --> 03:50.357
I cook a cake in the shape of 
bar stool favorite Lenny 

03:50.656 --> 03:51.712

03:57.226 --> 03:59.633
I see that no 
not want me here. 

04:01.422 --> 04:02.703
Homer Wait, do not go away. 

04:06.088 --> 04:07.226
Ok, emerges. 

04:07.225 --> 04:08.591
Who wants frosting ass? 

04:08.676 --> 04:11.622
I do not thank you 
the regime of Dr. Atkins. 

04:12.337 --> 04:13.485
My family hates me. 

04:13.652 --> 04:16.139
My friends stupid me 
saw an evening stupid. 

04:16.320 --> 04:18.337
They are all well 
sorry when I invented 

04:18.500 --> 04:20.673
the best soda in the world .....

04:20.844 --> 04:22.358
and that I do 
sharing with anyone! 

04:37.911 --> 04:39.405
A sign of destiny. 

04:46.438 --> 04:47.162
Finally, 

04:47.165 --> 04:50.798
a bar for men who love 
drink, and watch sexy girls. 

04:53.146 --> 04:54.304
Welcome to Knockers, honey. 

04:54.533 --> 04:56.976
Let me know if you see 
something that pleases you. 

04:59.712 --> 05:01.774
You do not see the sign, perverse? 

05:01.970 --> 05:03.101
It does not look at the enormous 
chests of our waitresses 

05:04.766 --> 05:07.373
I'd like a beer, and 
a sympathetic ear. 

05:07.533 --> 05:08.653
I have my own problems. 

05:08.816 --> 05:10.410
I lost this eye last night. 

05:11.514 --> 05:13.498
How did I get here? 

05:13.684 --> 05:16.327
I am the first 
depressed man in a bar. 

05:16.501 --> 05:18.233
I do not have any friend in the world. 

05:18.407 --> 05:20.617
Look at the size of this 
plate of nachos. 

05:20.817 --> 05:22.742
I have not seen 
all cheese 

05:22.879 --> 05:25.059
since I left my 
Billy Joel albums in the sun. 

05:28.724 --> 05:30.213
Sun. 

05:30.384 --> 05:31.447
We share? 

05:31.606 --> 05:34.503
It's been so long as 
I was not with someone 

05:34.536 --> 05:36.748
knowing that I am 
a big selfish pig. 

05:38.774 --> 05:39.581
It was me. 

05:40.033 --> 05:40.984
Remove your hand. 

05:41.452 --> 05:42.443
I have. 

05:43.597 --> 05:44.566
My name is Ray, 

05:44.728 --> 05:45.570
Ray Magini. 

05:45.725 --> 05:48.282
Ray, you who know me 
better than anyone, 

05:48.482 --> 05:50.416
how can I regain 
love my wife? 

05:50.606 --> 05:51.227
No idea 

05:51.413 --> 05:52.554
I'm no marriage counselor. 

05:52.706 --> 05:54.287
Just a roof repairer 
certified and sworn. 

05:59.438 --> 06:01.461
Ray, are you 
help me fix my roof? 

06:01.616 --> 06:02.469
Of course, 

06:02.622 --> 06:03.453
but on one condition. 

06:03.638 --> 06:05.504
You gotta help me 
what finir pitcher of beer. 

06:09.146 --> 06:10.260
I am not 
mistake in the addition? 

06:16.340 --> 06:18.336
Now, my first 
act as President ... 

06:26.300 --> 06:27.199
Deal! 

06:28.729 --> 06:29.827
In my new buddy. 

06:31.032 --> 06:33.503
Now we need 
a favorite song. 

06:33.729 --> 06:35.998
Any 
played by the jukebox. 

06:36.356 --> 06:37.092
Ok 

06:38.007 --> 06:41.144
"Let me ca again 

06:41.346 --> 06:43.539
Once is never enough ... " 

06:44.138 --> 06:44.825
The next song. 

06:44.982 --> 06:46.563
Yes, that's what I meant. 
- Yes, absolutely. 

06:51.876 --> 06:54.063
Homer, I 
awake with an owl 

06:54.070 --> 06:56.371
eating a mouse 
on the pillow next to. 

06:56.541 --> 06:58.556
I want to say 6 weeks 
more for this fall. 

06:58.726 --> 07:00.311
It means that 
you must repair the roof. 

07:00.484 --> 07:01.351
Do not worry darling, 

07:01.503 --> 07:02.884
I found 
a Roofer tonight. 

07:03.040 --> 07:04.534
And you can never guess where. 

07:04.809 --> 07:06.698
Knockers on Highway 98. 

07:06.869 --> 07:07.783
How do you know? 

07:07.934 --> 07:09.370
I'm medium. 

07:09.530 --> 07:12.394
I do not know if I want a 
roofer who frequent bars. 

07:12.564 --> 07:14.111
You're right margin. 

07:14.309 --> 07:15.882
I should look for a road 

07:16.041 --> 07:18.996
in scenes open to 
poets, where yoga retreats. 

07:19.176 --> 07:19.987
Tape me five. 

07:20.164 --> 07:21.435
I have values. 

07:21.600 --> 07:23.274
I will tape five 
for nothing. 

07:23.454 --> 07:25.183
Ray will get typed five. 

07:25.368 --> 07:26.880
You better be 
type five with the roof. 

07:27.048 --> 07:29.627
Yeah, Mom! 
- Zing! 

07:31.565 --> 07:33.315
Go children, will visit 
grandfather. 

07:33.516 --> 07:37.039
After that, we take the dog 
In the V-E-T-O ... 

07:37.751 --> 07:42.506
then we will make emmenera Bart 
C-I-R-C-O-N-C-I-R. 

07:43.378 --> 07:46.156
I'll say what it is 
when will finish. 

07:52.305 --> 07:53.126
Hi Homer. 

07:53.287 --> 07:56.437
Oh, Ray. You came at a time 
we set! 

07:56.616 --> 07:57.964
This is what 
I love you with Homer, 

07:58.122 --> 07:59.025
t'impressionne anything. 

07:59.197 --> 08:02.146
"Impressionistic". 
What word gigantic! 

08:02.182 --> 08:03.354
I will try 
in the dictionary. 

08:05.018 --> 08:07.599
It will require much work. 

08:07.771 --> 08:09.309
Tell me, do 
the roof was in good condition 

08:09.310 --> 08:10.351
when you bought the house? 

08:10.527 --> 08:11.764
I have not really checked. 

08:11.921 --> 08:13.678
I bought this 
house for the view. 

08:15.291 --> 08:17.510
One day this bowl is overflowing, 

08:17.669 --> 08:18.801
and I will be there. 

08:21.886 --> 08:24.795
it was just time to make 
a quick visit to grandfather 

08:25.009 --> 08:26.878
So when it feels like, 

08:27.088 --> 08:28.300
on leaves. 

08:31.078 --> 08:32.850
It should smell remains. 

08:33.052 --> 08:35.539
Please, on the 
called elderly. 

08:35.996 --> 08:37.164
Oh, look! 

08:38.196 --> 08:39.159
A dog? 

08:39.318 --> 08:41.125
What a pleasant surprise. 

08:41.342 --> 08:43.582
I'll spoil. 

08:48.403 --> 08:50.428
You can keep your dog? 
Please? 

08:50.638 --> 08:52.423
Keep my dog? 
Until when? 

08:52.706 --> 08:54.263
Not too long ago, 
until they die. 

09:00.707 --> 09:02.216
Well, he looks happy here. 

09:02.418 --> 09:05.383
In addition, studies on 
Older people have shown 

09:05.550 --> 09:08.319
that the company may animal 
slow the inevitable decline of ... 

09:08.320 --> 09:08.972
Yeah, okay, thank you. 

09:09.117 --> 09:11.134
Why would not you 
annoy other people? 

09:19.567 --> 09:20.560
Sorry, friend. 

09:20.764 --> 09:22.697
No problem. 
Accidents happen. 

09:26.467 --> 09:28.053
One, two, three, four. 

09:28.234 --> 09:29.482
I declare war nails! 

09:30.699 --> 09:31.972
That's why I 
'm embarked on the roof. 

09:36.374 --> 09:37.638
Homer. 

09:38.915 --> 09:40.250
Ned, you okay? 

09:40.332 --> 09:42.312
Yes, but not my mower 
can not get lower. 

09:43.733 --> 09:44.755
I was wrong. 

09:49.843 --> 09:51.344
This is Ned Flanders. 

09:52.220 --> 09:54.074
There is one in every neighborhood. 

09:55.222 --> 09:57.448
Sorry, I gotta go. 

09:57.621 --> 09:59.741
It said that my kid 
tried something. 

09:59.902 --> 10:01.625
Too bad it will end like this. 

10:06.762 --> 10:08.483
Goodbye, Ray. Bye. 

10:10.062 --> 10:11.843
He made the turn. 

10:12.015 --> 10:13.405
I see him again! 

10:20.233 --> 10:20.992
Homer! 

10:21.778 --> 10:23.820
You baves on the battery 
clothes for the poor. 

10:26.900 --> 10:29.512
And why the hole in 
the roof is even greater? 

10:29.713 --> 10:30.559
Do not worry. 

10:30.707 --> 10:31.892
Ray will return 
one minute to another. 

10:32.038 --> 10:33.129
It is six hours. 

10:33.289 --> 10:34.964
It will not come back. 

10:35.169 --> 10:36.848
This is a bad 
toiturier and a liar. 

10:37.001 --> 10:38.793
Hey, pay attention to 
what you say about it. 

10:38.954 --> 10:40.387
I think Ray 
could be the best. 

10:40.541 --> 10:41.210
The good what? 

10:41.369 --> 10:42.747
My new best friend. 

10:42.930 --> 10:44.644
We think the same way, 
we act in the same way, 

10:44.809 --> 10:46.642
one ends sandwich the other. 

10:46.808 --> 10:48.733
I want nothing 
hear about Ray. 

10:48.890 --> 10:50.520
Tomorrow morning you go 
buy a few shingles 

10:50.680 --> 10:52.297
and you repair this roof alone. 

10:52.488 --> 10:53.607
Ray does not like it. 

10:53.774 --> 10:54.758
You're not married to Ray. 

10:54.939 --> 10:57.028
Ben if I had been, it would 
had children greatest. 

11:01.234 --> 11:02.462
I'm sure everything 
the world is happy 

11:02.463 --> 11:04.398
with Petit Papa Noel 
for love. 

11:05.051 --> 11:07.577
I bet they all behave 
as young now 

11:07.751 --> 11:10.200
As in these pubs for 
laptops that everyone hates. 

11:19.249 --> 11:21.063
He became one of them. 

11:21.260 --> 11:23.458
You want a small bone? 

11:25.217 --> 11:26.523
It would be better off 
bring you back at home. 

11:26.742 --> 11:27.763
Come Lisa. 

11:27.919 --> 11:30.289
Once Derrick is finished. 

11:30.524 --> 11:32.611
Name of God ... 

11:36.200 --> 11:37.568
You know it's bad. 

11:37.737 --> 11:40.178
It was also from that dog 
long as I can remember. 

11:40.360 --> 11:42.347
What dog? 
- Who are you? 

11:42.367 --> 11:44.038
If only I knew. 

11:45.315 --> 11:46.042
You know, son, 

11:46.205 --> 11:49.510
my father often took me 
Johnson to the hardware. 

11:49.682 --> 11:53.348
The old Johnson knew 
repair anything. 

11:53.535 --> 11:56.678
When they built 
this place, he hanged. 

12:01.479 --> 12:02.050
Oh, sorry son. 

12:02.300 --> 12:05.553
I wanted you give me the 
stack of tiles the top shelf. 

12:05.803 --> 12:07.403
Hey, Ray is here! 

12:09.300 --> 12:10.068
Hi, Homer. 

12:10.318 --> 12:13.068
Look, I just get 
a package of shingles. 

12:14.953 --> 12:15.767
What there 
actually in the box? 

12:16.017 --> 12:18.056
I am truly sorry 
not to be back yesterday. 

12:18.306 --> 12:19.550
I hope we're still friends? 

12:19.800 --> 12:21.129
Of course that is. 

12:21.579 --> 12:24.400
If you want to. 

12:24.700 --> 12:27.700
I want, if you want you too. 

12:30.003 --> 12:31.850
Listen, let me take 
a bit of equipment, 

12:32.100 --> 12:34.950
and then I just 
directly repair your roof. 

12:36.518 --> 12:38.453
Dad, you remember when t'avais 
said that if I used a chainsaw 

12:38.703 --> 12:40.167
unattended 
I hurt? 

12:40.417 --> 12:41.856
You were wrong. 

12:42.106 --> 12:43.606
I hurt someone else. 

12:44.300 --> 12:47.700
I have 45 minutes for me 
prepare for the ball promo. 

12:49.229 --> 12:49.850
What are you doing? 

12:50.100 --> 12:51.753
Why do you not repair the roof? 

12:52.003 --> 12:53.003
I do not. 

12:53.100 --> 12:54.568
Ray will be there one minute to another. 

12:54.818 --> 12:58.943
I'm tired of hearing about 
this stupid Ray. 

12:59.193 --> 13:01.167
Which, incidentally, I 
have never even met. 

13:01.417 --> 13:05.467
Just look at the 
I painted portrait of him. 

13:06.956 --> 13:10.006
How do you think I was going 
react when you painted it? 

13:10.400 --> 13:11.400
More or less this way. 

13:23.279 --> 13:25.350
Homer, just dinner. 

13:25.600 --> 13:26.853
Is it that you have provided enough for Ray? 

13:27.103 --> 13:28.450
Ray will not come! 

13:28.700 --> 13:29.668
It will come! 

13:29.918 --> 13:35.053
His truck will turn at the intersection. 
Just. now! 

13:35.303 --> 13:37.067
Now! Now! 

13:37.317 --> 13:38.506
Now. 

13:38.756 --> 13:40.006
Now. 

13:56.079 --> 13:58.150
Homer, I know where is Ray. 

13:58.400 --> 13:58.953
Oh, God thank you. 

13:59.203 --> 14:00.150
Where is he? Tell me. 

14:00.400 --> 14:03.868
My heart, your friend 
Ray is in your head. 

14:04.118 --> 14:05.303
Ray falls 
not in my head. 

14:05.553 --> 14:07.203
It is a human being. 

14:08.117 --> 14:10.517
You have to understand ... 

14:11.556 --> 14:13.850
Ray does not exist. 

14:14.100 --> 14:15.059
If it exists. 

14:15.309 --> 14:19.250
It does, and when it 
come here, we'll play well. 

14:19.500 --> 14:20.550
You'll see. 

14:23.703 --> 14:25.703
We'll laugh ... Laugh! 

14:44.800 --> 14:45.668
What ... 

14:45.918 --> 14:46.503
What's happening? 

14:46.753 --> 14:48.603
Where are my shoes? 

14:51.717 --> 14:52.706
Get all the debates 
you want, Homer. 

14:52.956 --> 14:54.306
There's nothing you can do. 

14:56.300 --> 14:57.129
Why ... 

14:57.379 --> 14:58.529
Excuse us a moment. 

15:03.000 --> 15:04.353
What am I doing here? 

15:04.603 --> 15:05.450
Let me go. 

15:05.700 --> 15:09.268
There you go when you leave 
admit that there is no Ray Magini. 

15:09.518 --> 15:10.453
Well, I admit. 

15:10.703 --> 15:11.267
Help me, Ray! 

15:11.517 --> 15:12.706
Appears and the terrace! 

15:12.956 --> 15:15.650
Homer, no 
Ray never seen except you. 

15:15.900 --> 15:18.959
But it is not true, 
Bart saw at the store. 

15:19.209 --> 15:20.809
No, I have not seen Dad. 

15:21.500 --> 15:24.350
I saw you in the process 
to talk alone. 

15:25.203 --> 15:27.450
Flanders, you saw Ray 
on the roof with me! 

15:27.700 --> 15:28.268
Sorry, Homer. 

15:28.518 --> 15:32.168
You gonna say I'm Ray-tea 
because I do not think seeing. 

15:33.053 --> 15:34.353
Ned, you doing? 

15:35.817 --> 15:37.806
There must be 
someone who has seen, 

15:38.056 --> 15:41.229
someone who does not hate me, 
not like Flanders and Bart. 

15:42.079 --> 15:43.350
Wait. 

15:43.200 --> 15:44.753
The bartender's Knockers. 

15:45.003 --> 15:47.250
I called this bar 
Large breasts. 

15:47.500 --> 15:49.568
The bartender said that you were alone. 

15:49.818 --> 15:52.303
Ray is the result of 
your imagination, Homer. 

15:52.553 --> 15:54.067
You feel alone and rejected 

15:54.317 --> 15:55.706
then you've created. 

15:55.956 --> 15:56.750
And voila proof. 

15:57.000 --> 16:00.150
Ray is a Magini 
anagram of "imaginary". 

16:01.979 --> 16:03.850
My subconscious is a genius. 

16:04.100 --> 16:06.553
Well, all this 
was very convincing, and ... 

16:14.703 --> 16:15.853
It is right there! 

16:16.103 --> 16:18.503
Come on, nobody can see? 

16:19.618 --> 16:21.803
If only they could 
look from my point of view ... 

16:22.053 --> 16:24.453
I'm afraid it 
requires electric shocks. 

16:25.317 --> 16:26.317
Electric shocks? 

16:26.556 --> 16:29.429
The technical term is 
electro-convulsive therapy. 

16:29.679 --> 16:31.250
Well, it's 
a big difference. 

16:31.500 --> 16:32.353
Turn me, doc. 

16:32.603 --> 16:34.650
When you take the juice 
you can take my turtle? 

16:34.900 --> 16:36.768
I want to bring back to life. 

16:37.018 --> 16:37.863
and what is dead? 

16:38.113 --> 16:38.767
I do not know. 

16:39.017 --> 16:41.067
She died 
when I found it. 

16:46.456 --> 16:48.606
Homer, It is fair to 
bite inside, not for eating. 

16:50.800 --> 16:51.229
Sorry. 

16:51.479 --> 16:52.850
Give me one that 
did not taste so good. 

16:53.100 --> 16:54.753
It was a rubber 
covered with Vaseline. 

16:55.003 --> 16:56.850
Margin, mark it as 
it can buy. 

16:57.100 --> 16:59.250
It is high time 
starting this treatment. 

17:07.917 --> 17:09.303
How you doing, dear? 

17:09.553 --> 17:10.666
Much better. 

17:10.916 --> 17:13.165
You see someone 
that is not there? 

17:13.415 --> 17:16.116
No, just you, 
Marge and Yogi Bear. 

17:16.579 --> 17:17.878
I kidding! 

17:18.300 --> 17:20.752
I see that your sense 
of humor is not affected. 

17:21.002 --> 17:22.653
It is a very bad sign. 

17:31.600 --> 17:32.700
Real. 

17:33.018 --> 17:34.018
Not real. 

17:34.353 --> 17:35.353
Real. 

17:35.817 --> 17:36.606
Real. 

17:36.856 --> 17:39.250
Sorry, but recent Homer 
Historical evidence shows 

17:39.500 --> 17:41.650
Robin Hood that has not existed. 

17:44.449 --> 17:45.599
Fascinating! 

17:49.600 --> 17:50.653
The children, you 
you can relax. 

17:50.903 --> 17:52.550
Your father is 
good shape now. 

17:52.800 --> 17:53.868
Dandy and in good shape? 

17:54.118 --> 17:56.803
it should Dandini 
slowly return over time. 

17:57.053 --> 17:58.353
Dad! 

18:00.417 --> 18:03.017
The children, I heart you too. 

18:04.056 --> 18:06.350
I am happy to be rid 
this table to electric shocks. 

18:06.600 --> 18:10.059
Although to be honest, 
I loved lie. 

18:10.309 --> 18:10.850
Hello Homer. 

18:11.100 --> 18:11.753
It's Ray! 

18:12.003 --> 18:12.850
I see him again! 

18:13.100 --> 18:13.768
Kind of monster! 

18:14.018 --> 18:15.468
You do not exist. 

18:17.253 --> 18:21.003
Nobody treats me monster 
and no one doubts my existence! 

18:22.817 --> 18:25.367
The impressive 
power of the human spirit. 

18:26.556 --> 18:27.950
I too see Ray. 

18:28.200 --> 18:29.600
Like me. 

18:29.879 --> 18:31.150
Well, I'm not worried. 

18:31.400 --> 18:33.153
You have already agreed not to 
sue me. 

18:33.403 --> 18:34.550
When was that? 

18:34.800 --> 18:36.668
When I confirmed your 
parking space. 

18:36.918 --> 18:38.568
You do not validated my place. 

18:39.053 --> 18:40.453
Checkmate. 

18:42.717 --> 18:44.606
Then there is Ray? 

18:44.856 --> 18:45.329
Absolutely. 

18:45.579 --> 18:48.250
Now explore 
the improbable series of events 

18:48.500 --> 18:50.753
which led to this fun 
but tragic farce. 

18:51.003 --> 18:55.550
Because of my blindfold, I do 
Ray could not see sitting at the bar. 

18:55.800 --> 18:59.668
All I saw was you, 
eating and drinking and talking alone. 

18:59.918 --> 19:03.153
And Ned, you do not see me because 
I was hidden behind the fireplace. 

19:03.953 --> 19:05.447
I thought that my 
vision was excellent. 

19:05.697 --> 19:07.706
And here j'idolâtrais 
fake eyeballs. 

19:07.956 --> 19:08.750
Wait. 

19:09.000 --> 19:12.229
Why have I seen talking Homer 
in the wind at the workshop Barn? 

19:12.479 --> 19:13.729
Well, that ... 

19:14.500 --> 19:16.000
I can answer that. 

19:16.903 --> 19:21.250
I filed a tear in the texture 
of space-time combined 

19:21.500 --> 19:26.568
with pieces of metal 
suspension has created a black hole. 

19:26.818 --> 19:33.303
He intermediary between Homer and Bart, 
creating a gravitational lens 

19:33.553 --> 19:38.003
which has absorbed 
light reflected by Ray. 

19:41.417 --> 19:43.417
... It seems possible. 

19:45.756 --> 19:48.050
Wait, there is still a 
something that has no meaning. 

19:48.300 --> 19:51.869
Why did you start to repair 
the roof to disappear next? 

19:52.119 --> 19:54.169
It's easy, I 
'm an entrepreneur. 

19:57.400 --> 19:59.950
It's true, you are 
all crooks. 

20:03.600 --> 20:06.050
We are all 
crooks, it's true. 

20:07.118 --> 20:07.903
Wait a minute. 

20:08.153 --> 20:11.767
I received a lot of pain and 
suffering because of a small misunderstanding. 

20:12.017 --> 20:13.306
Someone owes me something. 

20:13.556 --> 20:15.450
I could do 
something for you ... 

20:15.700 --> 20:16.929
perhaps a free cleaning eyes. 

20:17.179 --> 20:18.150
It is a gift. 

20:18.400 --> 20:19.653
But there is something else. 

20:19.903 --> 20:22.903
Something else even more. 

20:26.900 --> 20:27.968
Homer, then I 
stop working? 

20:28.218 --> 20:29.553
I have a practice tomorrow. 

20:29.803 --> 20:32.267
Not until these 
gutters are not clean. 

20:34.317 --> 20:37.806
So as I said Homer, 
Monday, 21h, on CBS. 

20:38.056 --> 20:40.359
They say they love 
All this guy, but I am not freelance. 

20:40.609 --> 20:41.550
What are you talking about? 

20:41.800 --> 20:44.800
I'm just now saying, 
look at it as you can. 

20:49.003 --> 20:49.750
This is what time? 

20:50.000 --> 20:51.703
On Monday, at 21h, on CBS. 

20:51.953 --> 20:52.967
And on what channel? 

20:53.217 --> 20:53.606
CBS. 

20:53.856 --> 20:54.250
What time? 

20:54.500 --> 20:55.249
21h. 

20:55.499 --> 20:56.750
And if I want to 
look, what day? 

20:57.000 --> 20:58.150
Monday. 
- On Monday, 21h. 

20:58.400 --> 20:59.768
And it's on the radio? 

21:00.018 --> 21:02.306
No, it's on television. 
Monday at 21h. On CBS. 

21:02.556 --> 21:04.850
And if I want to see, 
What time do I look? 

21:05.100 --> 21:05.529
21h. 

21:05.779 --> 21:06.350
On what channel? 

21:06.600 --> 21:06.853
CBS. 

21:07.103 --> 21:07.450
What day? 

21:07.700 --> 21:07.868
Monday. 

21:08.118 --> 21:08.803
A radio? 

21:09.053 --> 21:09.267
Television. 

21:09.517 --> 21:11.106
Turn on the television what channel? 

21:11.356 --> 21:11.750
CBS. 

21:12.000 --> 21:12.559
What time? 

21:12.809 --> 21:13.750
21h Monday. 

21:14.000 --> 21:16.153
Now if I wanted 
see a certain day, 

21:16.403 --> 21:17.850
what would be the best day? 

21:18.100 --> 21:19.068
It was only on Monday. 

21:19.318 --> 21:21.153
And what time would be 
the better to view it? 

21:21.403 --> 21:22.767
21h. That 21h 21:30. 

21:23.017 --> 21:25.156
So if I turn my radio 21h ... 

21:25.406 --> 21:26.159
No radio, television. 

21:26.409 --> 21:28.653
So is Monday at 21h on NBC. 

21:28.903 --> 21:29.650
