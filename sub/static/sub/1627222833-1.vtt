00:52.292 --> 00:54.831
Men are pigs.

00:54.833 --> 00:58.415
Seriously, you can do so much
better than Bobby Kelske.

00:58.417 --> 00:59.706
Of all the girls at school,

00:59.708 --> 01:02.373
how could he stand me up
for Heidi Moore?

01:02.375 --> 01:04.540
Well, if you switch
her first and last initials,

01:04.542 --> 01:06.083
her name is Meidi Hoore.

01:11.417 --> 01:13.248
Thank you
for meeting me, Mel.

01:13.250 --> 01:14.748
I don't know
what I would do without you.

01:14.750 --> 01:18.165
Don't mention it.
Hey, it's Saturday night.

01:18.167 --> 01:20.540
Let's go to my house and have
an old-fashioned slumber party.

01:20.542 --> 01:21.873
Slumber party?

01:21.875 --> 01:23.456
No, we're not
in the sixth grade!

01:23.458 --> 01:28.581
In the sixth grade, we.
didn't have these.

01:28.583 --> 01:30.581
Look at you.

01:30.583 --> 01:32.540
Cool it. I don't have
enough for everybody.

01:33.625 --> 01:34.748
All right. Let's go.

01:34.750 --> 01:35.750
Okay.

01:37.208 --> 01:38.498
Oh, damn it.

01:38.500 --> 01:39.498
What? What's wrong?

01:39.500 --> 01:41.706
Auntie Flo decided
to pay her monthly visit.

01:41.708 --> 01:43.415
- Ew.
- I'll be right back.

01:43.417 --> 01:45.250
Well, take your time.
I'm gonna have a cigarette.

02:30.417 --> 02:32.665
Shit.

02:36.500 --> 02:37.500
Damn it.

02:41.667 --> 02:42.583
Hello?

02:44.792 --> 02:45.917
Anyone?

02:51.208 --> 02:52.208
A little help.

02:56.417 --> 02:57.500
Okay.

02:58.583 --> 02:59.915
Ah, shit.

03:02.708 --> 03:04.831
Uh, you...
you need help there?

03:04.833 --> 03:08.623
Ugh.
Oh, yeah.

03:08.625 --> 03:11.373
I, uh, I dropped my keys.

03:11.375 --> 03:13.706
And I, uh, I can't.

03:13.708 --> 03:16.706
Um, I'm sorry.
Would you mind?

03:16.708 --> 03:18.542
You see, I sprained my knee
on the slopes.

03:20.250 --> 03:21.456
My battery died,

03:21.458 --> 03:26.831
and now I'm stuck out here
in the cold.

03:26.833 --> 03:29.915
It's not really been
my day either, so.

03:33.292 --> 03:37.540
Thank you.
You are a lifesaver.

03:37.542 --> 03:38.875
Don't mention it.

03:43.375 --> 03:45.623
Uh, shit!

03:45.625 --> 03:46.873
That was fast.

03:46.875 --> 03:48.331
I'm sorry.

03:48.333 --> 03:51.333
This is the last time,
I promise.

03:57.583 --> 04:00.667
I think, I... I think
they went under there.

04:20.291 --> 04:21.915
Jill?

04:21.916 --> 04:22.748
What the hell, Jill?

04:22.750 --> 04:24.831
I was just
helping this guy out.

04:24.833 --> 04:25.790
Helping him with what?

04:25.792 --> 04:26.917
Find his keys.

04:28.417 --> 04:29.748
Yeah. I'm sure
that was all you were doing.

04:29.750 --> 04:32.956
Screw you, Bobby. You were the
one that ditched me for Heidi.

04:32.958 --> 04:35.373
And now
I'm ditching Heidi for you.

04:35.375 --> 04:36.790
So, get the fuck in.

04:36.792 --> 04:38.540
I told Melissa I was gonna
spend the night with her.

04:38.542 --> 04:40.748
Didn't you hear me?
I said now!

05:12.917 --> 05:14.833
Thanks a freakin' lot, Jill.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.040
Dammit, Jill.

06:18.042 --> 06:20.667
Please, sir, who are you?

06:22.042 --> 06:23.542
What do you want from me?

06:25.708 --> 06:26.956
Please, please.

06:28.417 --> 06:30.415
Let me out. Please.

06:35.583 --> 06:39.081
My dad's a cop, asshole.
He's expecting me any minute.

06:39.083 --> 06:41.081
And when he sees you, he will
kick the living shit out of you.

07:04.250 --> 07:06.748
Guilt is a mechanism

07:06.750 --> 07:08.623
we use to control people.

07:08.625 --> 07:10.998
It's, uh, an illusion,

07:11.000 --> 07:15.500
a kind of, uh,
a social control mechanism.

07:18.750 --> 07:21.625
Do I feel guilty
for anything I've done?

07:23.542 --> 07:27.748
No. I feel sorry
for people who feel guilt.

07:32.625 --> 07:35.083
What's one less person on
the face of this earth anyway?

08:56.208 --> 08:59.081
His first victim was
18-year-old Karen Sparks,

08:59.083 --> 09:01.206
poli-sci major at
the University of Washington.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.915
On the night of January 4th,

09:02.917 --> 09:05.083
the suspect entered
Karen's bedroom as she slept,

09:07.125 --> 09:09.956
bludgeoned her with a metal rod
he'd torn from her bed frame,

09:09.958 --> 09:12.290
and proceeded to
sexually assault her with it.

09:12.292 --> 09:14.706
Karen was lucky.
She survived.

09:14.708 --> 09:17.331
She spent the next ten days
in a coma

09:17.333 --> 09:19.998
and suffered permanent
brain damage from the attack.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.040
Less than a month later,
Lynda Healy,

09:22.042 --> 09:24.123
a 21-year-old psychology major,

09:24.125 --> 09:25.915
was abducted
in the middle of the night

09:25.917 --> 09:29.040
after an intruder broke
into her basement apartment.

09:29.042 --> 09:30.706
It's been nine months
since her abduction,

09:30.708 --> 09:32.625
yet no trace of Lynda Healy
has been found.

09:34.042 --> 09:35.081
Next.

09:35.083 --> 09:37.248
Donna Gail Manson, age 19.

09:37.250 --> 09:38.748
Three weeks later,

09:38.750 --> 09:40.248
Susan Rancourt, age 18.

09:40.250 --> 09:41.790
Susan's disappearance
was followed by

09:41.792 --> 09:44.206
Roberta Parks, age 20,

09:44.208 --> 09:46.623
followed by Brenda Ball,

09:46.625 --> 09:47.831
and Georgeann Hawkins.

09:47.833 --> 09:49.290
Like the others,

09:49.292 --> 09:51.625
none of these girls have been
seen or heard from since.

09:52.958 --> 09:54.790
Yes, Mr. Swindley.

09:54.792 --> 09:55.831
I mean,
by the looks of it,

09:55.833 --> 09:58.165
these chicks, they're all
sort of the same type.

09:58.167 --> 09:59.915
What "type" is that, exactly?

09:59.917 --> 10:03.165
Foxy, long legs, short skirts.

10:03.167 --> 10:05.123
The type that's usually
up for a good time.

10:05.125 --> 10:06.915
Maybe they led this guy on.

10:06.917 --> 10:08.748
I mean, you know how
the old saying goes, right?

10:08.750 --> 10:10.290
"If you're advertising,
you must be selling."

10:12.333 --> 10:15.456
If
stupidity was painful, Shane.

10:15.458 --> 10:17.373
you'd be in agony.

10:17.375 --> 10:18.625
Ooh.

10:21.667 --> 10:26.956
Three months ago, on July 14th,
the suspect struck again

10:26.958 --> 10:29.167
during a huge celebration
at Lake Sammamish State Park.

10:32.750 --> 10:36.706
This time, suspect's
far more brazen.

10:36.708 --> 10:38.873
Numerous witnesses
reported seeing a man

10:38.875 --> 10:41.790
with his left arm in a sling
asking various women

10:41.792 --> 10:44.081
if they would help him
rig a sailboat up to his car.

10:44.083 --> 10:45.792
Two of those women
unfortunately took the bait.

10:48.708 --> 10:50.167
Denise Naslund, Janice Ott.

10:53.292 --> 10:54.333
Both women decapitated.

10:56.375 --> 10:58.333
Both had been brutally raped.

11:00.333 --> 11:01.333
Postmortem.

11:06.042 --> 11:07.956
And multiple
witnesses confirmed

11:07.958 --> 11:12.915
they'd seen a suspect driving
either a tan or brown VW Beetle.

11:12.917 --> 11:14.167
When the suspect
approached them,

11:15.833 --> 11:18.165
he told them his name.

11:18.167 --> 11:19.083
It was Ted.

11:43.875 --> 11:46.040
How is a woman
like a laxative?

11:46.042 --> 11:47.373
They both irritate
the shit out of you!

11:50.333 --> 11:52.206
Since when did my desk become
the designated break room?

11:52.208 --> 11:54.248
And good morning to you, too.

11:54.250 --> 11:55.958
What's this look like
to you, McChesney?

11:57.125 --> 11:58.873
Names of our victims.

11:58.875 --> 12:01.040
Dates. Some random numbers.

12:01.042 --> 12:02.123
Shane here
has come up with

12:02.125 --> 12:03.456
a rather brilliant theory

12:03.458 --> 12:05.915
that could crack your case
wide open.

12:05.917 --> 12:08.123
Really?

12:08.125 --> 12:09.540
What theory is that?

12:09.542 --> 12:11.790
Pay attention.

12:11.792 --> 12:17.248
Thirty-six, 23, 36, 23, 36.

12:17.250 --> 12:19.081
Number of days
between each abduction.

12:19.083 --> 12:21.540
Look at this kid.
He hasn't even graduated yet.

12:21.542 --> 12:23.581
He's already gunning
for his old man's job.

12:23.583 --> 12:25.125
Except it's not accurate.

12:28.167 --> 12:31.206
There were 45 days
between Susan Rancourt's

12:31.208 --> 12:32.792
and Brenda Ball's
disappearances.

12:34.417 --> 12:36.458
You also forgot
the fifth victim, Roberta Parks.

12:42.250 --> 12:44.081
If you paid attention in class,

12:44.083 --> 12:47.081
you'd already know that
we went over these patterns.

12:47.083 --> 12:55.040
Thirty-six,
23, 36, 23, 45.

12:55.042 --> 12:56.581
Well, I just hope
we don't have another

12:56.583 --> 13:00.373
Zodiac-hippy-devil-worshipping-
Charles-fucking-Manson

13:00.375 --> 13:01.956
on our hands.

13:01.958 --> 13:03.956
Manson actually
wasn't a devil worshipper.

13:03.958 --> 13:05.956
Charlie is quite
the talker though.

13:05.958 --> 13:07.873
As you might imagine,
his favorite subject is himself.

13:07.875 --> 13:09.165
Who the fuck are you?

13:09.167 --> 13:10.958
And who the fuck
let you down here?

13:12.292 --> 13:13.375
I'm sorry.
Captain Swindley?

13:15.542 --> 13:17.456
Supervisory Special Agent
Robert Ressler.

13:17.458 --> 13:19.581
I'm with the Behavioral
Science Unit of the FBI.

13:19.583 --> 13:21.415
What's this about?

13:21.417 --> 13:23.206
I'm not here
to step on anyone's toes.

13:23.208 --> 13:25.581
Just to observe
and offer my assistance.

13:25.583 --> 13:28.206
I have my task force
well under control.

13:28.208 --> 13:31.331
We don't need any assistance
from the feds.

13:31.333 --> 13:34.206
Why would the Bureau be
taking an interest in this case?

13:34.208 --> 13:35.915
Have they been developing
their own leads?

13:35.917 --> 13:37.456
No, nothing like that.

13:37.458 --> 13:39.665
Part of our new mandate is to
educate local law enforcement

13:39.667 --> 13:42.998
by passing along information
we've gathered.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.165
Gathered from whom?

13:44.167 --> 13:45.415
Interviews
we've conducted

13:45.417 --> 13:47.206
with convicted offenders.

13:47.208 --> 13:49.165
We've been studying
the psychological aspects

13:49.167 --> 13:50.498
of their crimes

13:50.500 --> 13:53.040
in the hopes of eventually
developing a profile.

13:53.042 --> 13:55.665
Oh, you hear that, Shane?

13:55.667 --> 13:57.540
This is my son Shane.

13:57.542 --> 14:01.998
He just graduated WSU
with a degree in psychology

14:02.000 --> 14:05.206
and he's already top
of his class at the academy.

14:05.208 --> 14:07.915
He is going to be your best
resource around here.

14:07.917 --> 14:10.248
Actually, I was thinking
I would work with.

14:10.250 --> 14:11.417
Uh, Detective McChesney.

14:13.250 --> 14:16.373
Kathy here, she's
from our Sex Crimes Division.

14:16.375 --> 14:17.540
You know, I figured
it's a good idea

14:17.542 --> 14:19.915
to have at least one gal
on the team.

14:19.917 --> 14:21.456
You know,
soften up the witnesses,

14:21.458 --> 14:22.540
you know what I mean?

14:22.542 --> 14:23.540
And here I was thinking

14:23.542 --> 14:26.623
it was because of
her exemplary track record.

14:26.625 --> 14:28.373
I observed part of your class,
Detective.

14:28.375 --> 14:29.583
- I was impressed.
- Thank you.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.998
I joined the task force
after the Lake Sam murders.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.373
Janice Ott
and Denise Naslund.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.498
Last two taken,
first ones found.

14:38.500 --> 14:39.583
Only ones found.

14:41.208 --> 14:42.500
We still have six girls missing.

14:44.375 --> 14:45.706
Well, it's been
real quiet around here

14:45.708 --> 14:47.998
for the last three months.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.040
No Miss August.
No Miss September.

14:50.042 --> 14:51.540
No Miss October.

14:51.542 --> 14:53.206
So, I'd say old Teddy boy

14:53.208 --> 14:55.415
is either taking
an extended vacation,

14:55.417 --> 14:57.167
or he's found himself
a new hunting ground.

15:43.167 --> 15:44.540
Society
wants to believe

15:44.542 --> 15:48.998
it can identify evil people,
or bad or harmful people,

15:49.000 --> 15:51.123
but it's just not practical.

15:51.125 --> 15:53.290
Just like you can't
tell by looking at someone

15:53.292 --> 15:55.083
if they're a good person.

15:56.708 --> 15:58.748
No man is truly innocent.

15:58.750 --> 16:02.456
I mean, we've,
we've all transgressed

16:02.458 --> 16:04.373
in some way in our lives.

16:04.375 --> 16:06.998
I don't think anybody doubts
whether I've...

16:07.000 --> 16:09.373
I've done some bad things.

16:09.375 --> 16:10.790
The question is,

16:10.792 --> 16:15.625
what, of course, and how, and
maybe most importantly, why.

16:19.708 --> 16:23.206
Now, he chooses
his victims for a reason.

16:23.208 --> 16:27.165
His victims are young,
attractive women.

16:27.167 --> 16:31.665
But to him,
women are possessions.

16:31.667 --> 16:33.831
He instinctively
recognizes people

16:33.833 --> 16:36.331
who radiate vulnerability,

16:36.333 --> 16:40.165
their-their... their facial
expressions say,

16:40.167 --> 16:41.831
"I'm afraid of you."

16:53.708 --> 16:54.790
You need a lift?

16:54.792 --> 16:56.500
Fuck off and die,
you creep!

17:17.750 --> 17:19.205
He's coming.

17:26.625 --> 17:27.666
Okay.

18:30.292 --> 18:32.456
When he feels the last

18:32.458 --> 18:36.623
bit of breath leaving her body

18:36.625 --> 18:42.748
and he's looking
into her eyes, well,

18:42.750 --> 18:45.665
the person in that situation.

18:45.667 --> 18:47.331
Trick or treat.

18:47.333 --> 18:48.458
.is God.

19:06.250 --> 19:08.623
So.

19:08.625 --> 19:10.290
this is our system.

19:10.292 --> 19:14.667
Every potential's entered
manually and assigned a card.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.873
How do you keep track
of them without a database?

19:17.875 --> 19:19.290
Database?

19:19.292 --> 19:20.748
The only computer
in this entire office

19:20.750 --> 19:22.831
is in the payroll department.

19:22.833 --> 19:24.581
We're making some progress.

19:24.583 --> 19:27.331
Of the 40,000 VW Beetles
registered in the state,

19:27.333 --> 19:28.956
we've narrowed down the list
to less than a hundred.

19:28.958 --> 19:31.331
Cross-referenced
with records from local DOL?

19:31.333 --> 19:33.206
Law enforcement
in other counties?

19:33.208 --> 19:36.540
This is Seattle,
Washington, not Washington, DC.

19:36.542 --> 19:38.667
Information is never shared
between jurisdictions.

19:40.375 --> 19:42.375
Cutting through the bureaucratic
red tape is half the battle.

19:44.917 --> 19:46.833
As you can see,
he certainly has a type.

19:48.583 --> 19:50.248
All the girls were under 25,

19:50.250 --> 19:52.623
all Caucasian,

19:52.625 --> 19:54.706
100 to 125 pounds.

19:54.708 --> 19:56.373
Brownish hair
parted down the middle.

19:56.375 --> 19:57.581
We've found
that most sequence killers

19:57.583 --> 20:00.456
tend to choose victims with
common physical characteristics.

20:00.458 --> 20:04.790
Mm. I'm fairly certain
Ted is highly intelligent,

20:04.792 --> 20:07.790
probably reasonably
good-looking.

20:07.792 --> 20:09.956
He knows how to make
these girls trust him.

20:09.958 --> 20:12.831
He preys on their sympathy
and vulnerability.

20:12.833 --> 20:14.956
He sees
their kindness as weakness.

20:14.958 --> 20:16.667
And he knows
how to make them disappear.

20:33.875 --> 20:35.998
Heather?
What a surprise!

20:36.000 --> 20:38.623
Hey, cuz!
What are you up to?

20:38.625 --> 20:40.915
Oh, just killing some
time before my evening class.

20:40.917 --> 20:42.706
Looks like someone's
on a shopping spree.

20:42.708 --> 20:43.998
What's the occasion?

20:44.000 --> 20:45.331
Jim's taking me
out of town

20:45.333 --> 20:47.623
for our third anniversary
this weekend,

20:47.625 --> 20:49.998
so I figured I'd buy myself
a little something

20:50.000 --> 20:51.665
to keep him interested.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.915
if you know what I mean.

20:53.917 --> 20:55.623
Hey, why don't you
put those in your car

20:55.625 --> 20:56.748
and then meet me back inside?

20:56.750 --> 20:58.706
I'll buy you an Orange Julius
and we can catch up.

20:58.708 --> 21:00.665
Oh, hon, I'd love to,

21:00.667 --> 21:02.456
but I have to get home
and start dinner.

21:02.458 --> 21:03.748
I've turned into
a Stepford Wife.

21:03.750 --> 21:05.081
It's okay, next time.

21:05.083 --> 21:05.998
And give my love to Jim.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.250
I will.

21:10.542 --> 21:12.956
Excuse me, ma'am.

21:12.958 --> 21:16.498
Ma'am, do you own
a green Camaro?

21:16.500 --> 21:20.417
License plate 3AV 499?

21:21.500 --> 21:23.625
Yes. Who are you?

21:25.458 --> 21:26.623
Officer Rose.

21:26.625 --> 21:28.081
I'm with undercover
mall security.

21:28.083 --> 21:29.706
I mean, we apprehended a suspect

21:29.708 --> 21:31.956
attempting to break
into your car.

21:31.958 --> 21:33.331
Seriously?

21:33.333 --> 21:34.667
Yeah.
If you'll follow me.

21:39.958 --> 21:42.331
Was anything stolen?

21:42.333 --> 21:44.625
Well, that's what we
need you to tell us, ma'am.

21:48.375 --> 21:49.915
It looks all right to me.

21:49.917 --> 21:51.331
Well, tuck your head
in there

21:51.333 --> 21:52.333
and take a look around.

21:54.708 --> 21:55.748
My partner must have locked it

21:55.750 --> 21:58.040
before he took the suspect
in for questioning.

21:58.042 --> 21:59.375
I'm sorry.

22:07.708 --> 22:09.665
It doesn't look
like anything's missing.

22:09.667 --> 22:10.790
Well, take a good look.

22:10.792 --> 22:12.708
We wanna make sure he didn't
take anything of value.

22:16.667 --> 22:18.333
Really,
everything looks fine.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.498
Well, you're still
gonna need to come over

22:22.500 --> 22:23.873
to the station
and file a report.

22:26.583 --> 22:28.081
Like I said,
nothing was taken,

22:28.083 --> 22:29.790
so I really don't see why.

22:29.792 --> 22:32.790
You know, they're gonna
keep this man detained

22:32.792 --> 22:34.958
until you decide whether or not
you're going to press charges.

22:36.917 --> 22:39.915
Look, it'll only
take a few minutes, all right?

22:39.917 --> 22:41.581
Station's right up the road.

22:41.583 --> 22:44.040
Hell, I'll drive you.

22:44.042 --> 22:45.956
I'm supposed to meet
my boyfriend soon.

22:45.958 --> 22:47.917
- I hope this won't take long.
- I'll have you back in a flash.

22:51.208 --> 22:54.540
By the way, are you
related to Heather?

22:54.542 --> 22:55.623
She's my cousin.

22:56.708 --> 22:58.165
I knew it. I knew it.

22:58.167 --> 22:59.706
You know, I just ran into her
in the mall.

22:59.708 --> 23:01.665
So did I.
But how did you...

23:01.667 --> 23:03.458
I used to go to school
with her husband, Jim.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.875
Man, he's a good guy.

23:08.833 --> 23:10.667
Come on. It'll be quick.

23:21.542 --> 23:22.500
It's open.

23:25.875 --> 23:27.581
It's open.

23:49.042 --> 23:50.581
So how do you know
Jim again?

23:54.792 --> 23:55.915
On second thought,
I think it's easier

23:55.917 --> 23:57.917
if I just drive myself.
I know where the station is.

24:00.958 --> 24:02.458
Can we just do this
another time?

24:04.750 --> 24:05.875
Please, just pull over.

24:12.125 --> 24:13.581
I'm not kidding!

24:13.583 --> 24:17.623
You let me out of this
fucking car right now!

24:22.083 --> 24:24.000
Do you wanna know
what I'm going to do you?

24:25.208 --> 24:28.956
First, I'm gonna strangle you.

24:28.958 --> 24:32.498
Then I'm going to rape you.
And then...

24:32.500 --> 24:34.667
Get off of me!

24:38.125 --> 24:39.750
Help me! Please!

24:41.583 --> 24:43.165
Wait! Wait! Don't!

24:43.167 --> 24:44.956
Wait for me! Please, stop.

24:44.958 --> 24:45.831
Stop! Stop!

24:45.833 --> 24:47.290
Ah!

24:47.292 --> 24:48.331
Help!

24:48.333 --> 24:49.542
Stop! Please! Stop!

24:51.792 --> 24:53.165
Wait, wait.

24:53.167 --> 24:54.831
Go, go, go.
Please drive. Please drive.

25:24.333 --> 25:25.915
Oh, get this.

25:25.917 --> 25:28.915
Last month, he brings
in the goddamn psychic.

25:30.042 --> 25:30.998
Swindley thinks
there's a satanic cult

25:31.000 --> 25:33.206
behind every unsolved murder
in this city.

25:33.208 --> 25:35.998
When it's probably his
anti-social pantywaist of a son.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.208
I will drink to that.

25:38.667 --> 25:39.831
So, what made you
want to join the Bureau?

25:39.833 --> 25:40.792
Mm.

25:43.125 --> 25:44.373
I grew up in Chicago.

25:44.375 --> 25:45.956
Mm-hm.

25:45.958 --> 25:49.831
When I was 15, I became
obsessed with these articles

25:49.833 --> 25:52.373
published by The Tribune
about the Lipstick Killer.

25:54.167 --> 25:55.208
I didn't make up the name.

25:58.250 --> 25:59.042
Oh.

26:01.083 --> 26:02.998
I guess
you can't take me anywhere.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.248
Anyway.

26:04.250 --> 26:05.583
what about you?

26:06.958 --> 26:08.915
How'd you get involved
with the sheriff's department?

26:08.917 --> 26:11.333
Well, oh,
it wasn't my first choice.

26:13.417 --> 26:16.165
During my senior criminal
justice seminar...

26:16.167 --> 26:20.748
oh, mind you, I am one of three
girls in the class of 200...

26:20.750 --> 26:24.873
and this Bureau guy comes in
one day to do some recruiting.

26:24.875 --> 26:26.373
He starts handing out
applications

26:26.375 --> 26:28.415
and when he finally gets to me,
he says,

26:28.417 --> 26:32.915
"Sorry, FBI doesn't hire
female agents."

26:32.917 --> 26:35.208
All I can say about that
is times are changing.

26:37.083 --> 26:38.331
I wouldn't be surprised
if one day,

26:38.333 --> 26:39.915
you're leading the charge
at Quantico,

26:39.917 --> 26:41.665
tracking down
sequence killers.

26:42.667 --> 26:44.748
Mm.

26:44.750 --> 26:46.708
Ooh, yes.

26:52.667 --> 26:53.833
Not sequence killers.

26:55.958 --> 26:56.833
Serial killers.

26:58.333 --> 26:59.708
That's what
they should be called.

27:01.292 --> 27:02.373
Serial killers?

27:02.375 --> 27:03.706
You know,
like the old Westerns.

27:03.708 --> 27:04.375
Ah!

27:06.000 --> 27:08.123
They always ended with
this huge cliffhanger, right?

27:08.125 --> 27:09.290
You had to come back
the following week

27:09.292 --> 27:11.915
to find out what happened,
and then the week after that.

27:11.917 --> 27:13.790
Oh, never fully satisfied.

27:13.792 --> 27:16.040
They always leave you
wanting more.

27:16.042 --> 27:17.915
And.

27:17.917 --> 27:21.665
you know, these killers kind of
do the same thing.

27:21.667 --> 27:23.081
First, it's one victim.

27:23.083 --> 27:24.250
Then two. Then three.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.831
And each time they think
that the next one

27:28.833 --> 27:29.873
will bring them
closer to fulfilling

27:29.875 --> 27:30.875
their ultimate fantasy.

27:32.375 --> 27:33.667
It's a never-ending cycle.

27:34.792 --> 27:36.456
Like a serial.

27:36.458 --> 27:38.290
You're going to make
one hell of an agent one day,

27:38.292 --> 27:39.375
you know that, McChesney?

27:41.125 --> 27:42.333
A serial killer.

27:44.167 --> 27:45.873
It makes sense.

27:45.875 --> 27:47.958
Well, consider it yours,
Agent Ressler.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.165
No credit necessary.

27:51.167 --> 27:51.956
We interrupt this program

27:51.958 --> 27:53.873
to bring you a special report.

27:53.875 --> 27:54.956
Earlier today,

27:54.958 --> 27:56.748
the bodies of
four more young women

27:56.750 --> 27:58.998
were found on Taylor Mountain.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.748
All of them had been strangled

28:00.750 --> 28:02.331
or bludgeoned
by this brutal killer.

28:02.333 --> 28:04.165
Remains of six missing girls

28:04.167 --> 28:05.873
were found at the same site.

28:05.875 --> 28:09.206
The skeletal remains
of 21-year-old woman Ann Healy,

28:09.208 --> 28:12.331
22-year-old Brenda Ball
of Seattle,

28:12.333 --> 28:14.456
18-year-old
Susan Elaine Rancourt

28:14.458 --> 28:16.206
of Anchorage, Alaska,

28:16.208 --> 28:19.081
and 20-year-old
Roberta Kathleen Parks

28:19.083 --> 28:20.998
from Lafayette, California.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.040
Just a few miles away
from the place...

28:22.042 --> 28:24.373
- He did it.
- ...where those four were found,

28:24.375 --> 28:25.290
police identified two more
murdered girls.

28:25.292 --> 28:27.373
He killed them all.

28:27.375 --> 28:28.373
These two disappeared

28:28.375 --> 28:29.706
- from the same place.
- And he just dumped them

28:29.708 --> 28:30.706
- up on that mountain like trash.
- Lake Sammamish State Park.

28:30.708 --> 28:33.331
They were 23-year-old
Janice Ott

28:33.333 --> 28:34.373
- and 19-year-old Denise Naslund.
- He is goin to do it

28:34.375 --> 28:39.292
again and again and again.

28:43.208 --> 28:44.956
Two
more women have gone missing:

28:44.958 --> 28:48.123
Julie Cunningham,
a 26-year-old woman from Vail,

28:48.125 --> 28:49.915
and Denise Oliverson,

28:49.917 --> 28:52.831
a 24-year-old
from Grand Junction.

28:52.833 --> 28:55.165
On January 12, 1975,

28:55.167 --> 28:58.206
Caryn Campbell disappeared
from the Wildwood Inn.

28:58.208 --> 29:01.081
Thirty-six days later,
her nude body was found

29:01.083 --> 29:03.331
almost three miles away.

29:03.333 --> 29:04.415
Debbie was attending a play

29:04.417 --> 29:06.415
with her family
at Viewmont High School

29:06.417 --> 29:09.415
on the night
of November 8, 1974.

29:09.417 --> 29:11.248
She left the play early
to pick up her brother

29:11.250 --> 29:12.456
at an ice rink.

29:12.458 --> 29:14.248
Debbie never got to her car.

29:14.250 --> 29:15.665
Police believe the key

29:15.667 --> 29:19.290
was from the same handcuffs
used to kidnap Carol DaRonch

29:19.292 --> 29:20.373
four hours earlier

29:20.375 --> 29:23.456
the same night
Debbie Kent disappeared.

29:23.458 --> 29:26.081
Nighttime at the Kents' home
in Bountiful,

29:26.083 --> 29:28.290
this front porch light
burns for Debbie.

29:28.292 --> 29:30.456
Mrs. Kent vowed
when her daughter disappeared,

29:30.458 --> 29:32.165
"I'll turn the light off

29:32.167 --> 29:34.540
only when Debbie comes home."

29:34.542 --> 29:36.540
The hardest part,
Mrs. Kent says,

29:36.542 --> 29:38.792
is the heartache of
not knowing.

30:19.875 --> 30:21.415
This is
gonna take a while.

30:21.417 --> 30:22.417
I don't care.

30:24.167 --> 30:25.500
I'll stay with them
all night if I have to.

30:29.917 --> 30:32.083
Come on.
I'll buy you a coffee.

31:00.292 --> 31:01.417
I'm gonna get him, Ressler.

31:05.667 --> 31:07.208
If it's the last thing I do.

31:12.208 --> 31:13.875
I'm gonna get him
for what he did to those girls.

31:17.625 --> 31:19.083
You almost act
as if you knew them.

31:20.542 --> 31:21.625
Ah, well.

31:23.625 --> 31:25.083
I had an older sister.

31:27.083 --> 31:28.208
Her name was Jamie.

31:30.625 --> 31:38.081
Ah, yeah. She, uh, ran away
when she was 16 years old.

31:38.083 --> 31:41.083
And our parents just spent
months looking for her.

31:43.333 --> 31:45.665
They thought she'd gone to
San Francisco and joined a cult.

31:45.667 --> 31:46.917
But.

31:49.625 --> 31:53.206
she was just hitchhiking on
the coast, meeting people.

31:53.208 --> 31:56.042
Yeah, I guess she was... she was
just trying to find herself.

31:58.667 --> 32:00.417
You know, she made it
as far as Portland.

32:04.417 --> 32:06.625
Last guy that picked her up
drugged her.

32:09.042 --> 32:10.083
Raped her.

32:13.542 --> 32:15.083
He left her in a heroin den.

32:20.708 --> 32:23.083
She never regained
consciousness, so.

32:26.542 --> 32:27.958
Detective McChesney?

32:29.208 --> 32:30.581
Yes.

32:30.583 --> 32:34.373
I'm... Lynda Healy's mother.

32:34.375 --> 32:36.081
I am so...

32:36.083 --> 32:37.000
Please don't.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.500
I don't want to hear
that word ever again.

32:44.125 --> 32:47.417
I need you to listen to
just one thing I have to say.

32:49.292 --> 32:54.083
I want you to find the monster
who did this to my daughter.

32:57.583 --> 32:59.000
I want you to find him.

33:01.583 --> 33:03.000
And when you do,

33:05.083 --> 33:08.208
I want you to shoot him dead.

34:58.375 --> 34:59.873
That's him.

34:59.875 --> 35:01.583
Are you
absolutely sure, Carol?

35:03.750 --> 35:05.373
Take your time.
It's almost been...

35:05.375 --> 35:06.333
That's him!

35:07.917 --> 35:10.331
That's the shitbag
who tried to kidnap me.

35:10.333 --> 35:12.625
I will never forget his face.
Never.

35:17.458 --> 35:19.542
Thank you.
We'll be in touch.

35:20.708 --> 35:22.623
I'll testify.

35:22.625 --> 35:24.956
I'll do whatever it takes
to put him away.

35:24.958 --> 35:29.292
Because that guy
is totally fucking crazy.

35:42.167 --> 35:44.706
So, would you say the fantasy

35:44.708 --> 35:48.831
is more stimulating to
this person than the act itself?

35:48.833 --> 35:54.873
Well, I'd assume
that what most stimulates

35:54.875 --> 35:58.748
such an individual is, uh,

35:58.750 --> 36:01.250
the hunt,
the pursuit of his victim.

36:03.667 --> 36:06.706
Well, what would you say
this individual

36:06.708 --> 36:09.331
gains from his hunt?

36:09.333 --> 36:10.623
Why does he keep
referring to himself

36:10.625 --> 36:11.708
in the third person?

36:13.708 --> 36:15.706
As if everything he's saying
is a hypothetical?

36:15.708 --> 36:17.498
"This individual,"
"this person."

36:18.833 --> 36:20.500
Because he's not
giving us a confession.

36:21.625 --> 36:24.331
He's merely "hypothesizing."

36:24.333 --> 36:25.917
Sharing his "legal opinion."

36:27.333 --> 36:29.792
Ah. Law school dropout
turned Perry Mason.

36:30.917 --> 36:32.706
This is such bullshit.

36:32.708 --> 36:34.415
Do you think
this person

36:34.417 --> 36:38.706
would have kept mementos
of his victims?

36:38.708 --> 36:41.290
Locks of hair? Jewelry?

36:41.292 --> 36:43.375
Photographs, perhaps?

36:45.333 --> 36:46.498
I would think
it's certainly

36:46.500 --> 36:49.706
not out of the realm
of possibility.

36:49.708 --> 36:51.917
And what makes you think that?

36:55.708 --> 36:56.917
Well.

37:02.875 --> 37:05.292
when you work hard
to do something right,

37:08.458 --> 37:09.917
you don't want to forget it.

37:14.458 --> 37:18.250
Let's, uh,
you know, take a short break.

37:27.750 --> 37:28.665
Dr. Fred Richmore,

37:28.667 --> 37:31.040
from the Bureau's
Behavioral Science Unit.

37:31.042 --> 37:33.873
Detective Kathleen McChesney,
Seattle Homicide.

37:33.875 --> 37:35.373
Bob.

37:35.375 --> 37:36.998
Detective.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.417
So, what are we
looking at here?

37:45.292 --> 37:48.915
In my 16 years
as a clinical psychiatrist,

37:48.917 --> 37:50.790
I can honestly say
Theodore Bundy

37:50.792 --> 37:53.333
is the most dangerous individual
I've ever observed.

37:55.542 --> 37:57.956
Mr. Bundy
seems to derive a deep,

37:57.958 --> 38:01.790
almost mystical
satisfaction from killing.

38:01.792 --> 38:03.456
After a while,
the act of murdering

38:03.458 --> 38:06.790
isn't just about
lust or violence.

38:06.792 --> 38:08.998
It's about possession.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.123
Possession?

38:10.125 --> 38:11.831
Mm.

38:11.833 --> 38:14.665
Is this his way of copping to
some kind of insanity defense?

38:14.667 --> 38:17.331
No, no, no,
nothing like that.

38:17.333 --> 38:18.623
You have to first understand

38:18.625 --> 38:21.706
there are two distinct parts
to his personality.

38:21.708 --> 38:24.623
First is Ted.

38:24.625 --> 38:29.790
Helpful, personable,
articulate, charming Ted.

38:29.792 --> 38:32.373
And then, there's the entity.

38:32.375 --> 38:33.333
Entity?

38:34.833 --> 38:36.790
So, you're saying
he has a split personality?

38:36.792 --> 38:38.831
Not exactly.

38:38.833 --> 38:41.748
I believe
it's a complex pathology

38:41.750 --> 38:45.956
wherein the entity
is both in and of Ted.

38:45.958 --> 38:48.498
First is his dominant
personality,

38:48.500 --> 38:51.081
his mask of sanity,
if you will.

38:51.083 --> 38:55.498
And then, there's the entity.

38:55.500 --> 38:56.581
I believe it began with

38:56.583 --> 38:58.665
an unnatural obsession
with pornography

38:58.667 --> 39:00.456
from a very young age.

39:00.458 --> 39:01.998
And I don't mean
the blue magazines

39:02.000 --> 39:04.081
that teenage boys hide
from their parents,

39:04.083 --> 39:08.040
but rather, he became obsessed
with sexually explicit

39:08.042 --> 39:13.040
images of violence,
with human pain and suffering.

39:13.042 --> 39:16.540
And he believes this entity
has given him magical abilities,

39:16.542 --> 39:18.915
like the power
to walk through walls,

39:18.917 --> 39:20.831
and to not be seen.

39:20.833 --> 39:23.708
To make him... invisible.

39:25.625 --> 39:29.123
All this,
and it still doesn't add up

39:29.125 --> 39:30.915
to a legal confession?

39:30.917 --> 39:32.956
Not yet.

39:32.958 --> 39:35.958
But I'm certain there are
many more victims out there.

39:38.542 --> 39:39.875
yet to be found.

39:49.667 --> 39:50.831
Bundy was being held

39:50.833 --> 39:52.498
in the Garfield County Jail

39:52.500 --> 39:55.415
because it is modern
and said to be much more secure

39:55.417 --> 39:59.206
than facilities in Aspen,
about an hour away.

39:59.208 --> 40:02.123
Bundy's escape
bordered on a Houdini escapade.

40:02.125 --> 40:05.915
The 5'11", 145-pound
former law student

40:05.917 --> 40:09.165
ripped out a light fixture
and steel grating in the ceiling

40:09.167 --> 40:11.081
and then maneuvered himself up

40:11.083 --> 40:12.831
through a 12-inch by 12-inch

40:12.833 --> 40:14.456
hole in the ceiling.

40:14.458 --> 40:15.915
Are you watching this?

40:15.917 --> 40:17.206
That son of a bitch.

40:17.208 --> 40:18.915
We're looking everywhere.

40:18.917 --> 40:21.581
Trains, buses,
and this is the usual thing.

40:21.583 --> 40:22.998
I have no idea where he is.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.206
He'll blend in. Disappear.
That's what he does.

40:25.208 --> 40:28.248
But he doesn't have any money,
clothing.

40:28.250 --> 40:31.081
Unless he got help from
someone on the outside?

40:31.083 --> 40:33.998
He easily got himself
a ten-hour lead but.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.165
with any luck,
the weather's slowing him down.

40:36.167 --> 40:38.581
He won't last long
in a snowstorm.

40:38.583 --> 40:40.208
He'll have to go someplace...

40:41.917 --> 40:42.833
...warm.

40:45.917 --> 40:47.623
Call me if you got something.

40:50.125 --> 40:56.123
Seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one.

40:56.125 --> 40:59.790
Happy New Year!
Happy New Year.

40:59.792 --> 41:00.750
Happy New Year.

41:11.958 --> 41:13.040
Good night.

41:13.042 --> 41:14.458
Bye. Night.

42:07.750 --> 42:09.873
Shit!

42:13.042 --> 42:14.373
Hey, what's going on?

42:17.833 --> 42:18.750
Are you okay?

44:17.750 --> 44:23.165
♪ Do Lord do Lord
Do remember me ♪

44:23.167 --> 44:28.748
♪ Do Lord do Lord
Do remember me ♪

44:28.750 --> 44:31.706
♪ Do Lord do Lord ♪

44:31.708 --> 44:34.165
♪ Do remember me ♪

44:34.167 --> 44:35.875
♪ Do Lord remember me ♪

44:37.500 --> 44:38.831
Oh, shit.

44:45.875 --> 44:47.456
Good afternoon, Mrs. Bundy.

44:47.458 --> 44:49.248
I-I don't know
if you remember me.

44:49.250 --> 44:50.206
I'm Det. McChesney

44:50.208 --> 44:51.998
with the King County
Sheriff's Department,

44:52.000 --> 44:55.123
and this is Agent Ressler
with the FBI.

44:55.125 --> 44:56.292
May we have a moment
of your time?

44:57.875 --> 45:00.165
Surely. Come right in.

45:17.042 --> 45:18.042
There we go.

45:19.375 --> 45:22.042
I'm sorry it isn't much.
I wasn't expecting company.

45:23.375 --> 45:24.873
Do you mind
if I turn the record off?

45:24.875 --> 45:26.208
No, go right ahead.

45:27.417 --> 45:30.331
I always find comfort
in the Lord's music.

45:31.875 --> 45:32.915
Cream and sugar?

45:32.917 --> 45:34.165
- Oh, no, thank you.
- Okay.

45:35.167 --> 45:36.458
Here you go.

45:39.875 --> 45:42.915
I suppose you know
why we're here, Mrs. Bundy.

45:42.917 --> 45:44.915
Oh, please
call me Louise.

45:44.917 --> 45:47.123
- Louise.
- Hm.

45:47.125 --> 45:50.040
I'm sure you've heard that.

45:50.042 --> 45:52.123
your son escaped from custody
again.

45:52.125 --> 45:53.915
I'm quite aware.

45:53.917 --> 45:57.248
The reporters have been calling
the house day and night.

45:57.250 --> 46:00.250
It got so bad I had to take
the phone off the hook.

46:02.167 --> 46:04.083
Do you have any idea where
he might have gone, ma'am?

46:06.375 --> 46:09.165
If I had
any information to share,

46:09.167 --> 46:11.250
I certainly would have
done so already.

46:12.583 --> 46:14.290
I think it's just terrible

46:14.292 --> 46:15.833
what they are doing
to my poor son.

46:17.625 --> 46:19.833
You're going through
a terrible ordeal, Louise.

46:21.333 --> 46:23.456
We didn't come to
further upset you.

46:23.458 --> 46:26.290
Yes, all of this
is very upsetting.

46:26.292 --> 46:27.167
I know it is.

46:29.958 --> 46:32.206
But it's very important
you let us know

46:32.208 --> 46:35.831
if you have had any contact
with your son.

46:35.833 --> 46:38.290
I haven't heard
from Teddy in weeks.

46:38.292 --> 46:40.373
But I hear what they're
saying on the news.

46:40.375 --> 46:42.248
And the things
those awful women in church

46:42.250 --> 46:43.917
are whispering behind my back.

46:45.333 --> 46:51.165
But I can tell you,
this is all a very big mistake.

46:51.167 --> 46:54.165
Mistake?
With all due respect, ma'am,

46:54.167 --> 46:56.583
your son is currently on
the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list.

46:58.292 --> 47:02.042
With all due respect,
you do not know my son.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.206
You have to understand
that it wasn't easy

47:08.208 --> 47:10.915
being an unwed mother
back when Teddy was born.

47:10.917 --> 47:13.998
I was very young
at the time I had him.

47:14.000 --> 47:18.456
My parents tried to force me
to give my baby up for adoption,

47:18.458 --> 47:22.165
but I couldn't bear to do that.

47:22.167 --> 47:25.456
So, I carried on.

47:25.458 --> 47:28.915
And finally, they said,
"All right, Louise,

47:28.917 --> 47:31.290
you can stay home
and have your baby

47:31.292 --> 47:32.290
and finish school.

47:32.292 --> 47:34.000
But on one condition:

47:35.542 --> 47:39.540
That we raise Teddy as our own."

47:39.542 --> 47:41.290
So, you're saying
Ted grew up believing

47:41.292 --> 47:43.458
you weren't his mother,
but his sister?

47:44.625 --> 47:48.998
My mother,
she had some problems

47:49.000 --> 47:52.040
and she had to be committed
to an institution.

47:52.042 --> 47:54.415
My father,

47:54.417 --> 47:57.373
he had a dark side.

47:57.375 --> 48:00.040
especially when he drank.

48:00.042 --> 48:02.665
He used to say,

48:02.667 --> 48:06.373
that Teddy
was conceived in hell.

48:06.375 --> 48:09.456
I suppose that would make
my father the devil,

48:09.458 --> 48:10.417
wouldn't it?

48:14.375 --> 48:15.875
Do you remember
Ann-Marie Burr?

48:17.417 --> 48:21.373
Seven-year-old girl
who lived a few miles from here?

48:21.375 --> 48:24.290
Back in '61, she disappeared
without a trace.

48:24.292 --> 48:25.998
Remember?

48:26.000 --> 48:28.581
Of course, I remember.
Poor little thing.

48:28.583 --> 48:31.206
Her parents
were just devastated.

48:31.208 --> 48:34.290
Do you recall Ted
was around 14 at the time?

48:34.292 --> 48:36.248
He delivered newspapers
in the neighborhood.

48:36.250 --> 48:37.958
Ted had nothing
to do with that.

48:40.625 --> 48:42.415
I'm-I'm sorry.

48:42.417 --> 48:46.081
That's all the information
I have for you.

48:46.083 --> 48:53.583
Except to say my son Ted is
the best son in the whole world.

48:58.333 --> 48:59.375
We'll be in touch.

49:01.542 --> 49:05.623
If you let me know
when you're coming next time,

49:05.625 --> 49:10.292
I'll be sure to serve
ice cream and hot apple pie.

49:16.625 --> 49:19.081
Well, that was interesting.

49:19.083 --> 49:23.331
Yeah.
She doesn't know anything.

49:23.333 --> 49:25.123
We can still tap her line

49:25.125 --> 49:26.208
in case he tries to call.

49:27.583 --> 49:28.958
Mm-mm. He won't.

49:30.458 --> 49:31.458
He's got other plans now.

50:01.542 --> 50:03.040
It's been empty
for a few months.

50:03.042 --> 50:06.040
Don't mind the dust.
Come on in.

50:06.042 --> 50:07.415
What'd you say
your name was again?

50:07.417 --> 50:11.165
Chris. Chris Hagen.

50:11.167 --> 50:13.540
Oh. Nice to meet you,
Chris Hagen.

50:13.542 --> 50:16.206
I'm Dorothy Slater, but
the girls all call me Dottie.

50:16.208 --> 50:18.542
Class of '69.
Chi till we die!

50:20.667 --> 50:23.873
So, you're a transfer
student from...?

50:23.875 --> 50:27.081
UCLA. I'm finishing my MBA.

50:27.083 --> 50:29.456
Wow, Los Angeles.

50:29.458 --> 50:33.123
Must be nice getting away
from all them weirdos.

50:33.125 --> 50:35.415
Oh, feel free to get rid
of this old junk.

50:35.417 --> 50:36.665
Once upon a time,
I was gonna be a big

50:36.667 --> 50:38.456
Fifth Avenue fashion designer

50:38.458 --> 50:42.123
but none of my stuff made it
past the Brooklyn Bargain Mart.

50:42.125 --> 50:43.415
But hey, you can't fault a girl

50:43.417 --> 50:45.623
for giving it
the old college try!

50:45.625 --> 50:46.583
Of course not.

50:48.708 --> 50:50.208
Hm.

50:52.750 --> 50:54.458
Wait for me.

51:00.167 --> 51:01.665
Keep your eyes
in your head, sweetie.

51:01.667 --> 51:04.206
Don't let my sunny disposition
fool you.

51:04.208 --> 51:06.498
I'm a damn strict house mother,

51:06.500 --> 51:09.206
and I don't tolerate
no funny business.

51:09.208 --> 51:10.748
I also don't make it a habit

51:10.750 --> 51:13.583
of taking in handsome
grad students as boarders.

51:15.417 --> 51:19.331
I just need a place to shower,
study, and sleep. That's all.

51:19.333 --> 51:21.790
Well, if you're looking
to move in right away,

51:21.792 --> 51:23.375
I'll make it easy on you.

51:25.458 --> 51:27.540
How much?

51:27.542 --> 51:29.623
Sixty dollars a week.

51:29.625 --> 51:31.706
But if you keep the grass
trimmed and the driveway swept,

51:31.708 --> 51:34.123
I'll make it an even 50.

51:34.125 --> 51:35.581
Deal.

51:35.583 --> 51:36.873
Well then, welcome

51:36.875 --> 51:39.583
to what we like to call
Chez Oaks.

51:40.625 --> 51:42.748
Hm.

51:42.750 --> 51:47.665
You know what?
I think I forgot.

51:47.667 --> 51:52.456
Yeah, I'm gonna
need to go to the bank

51:52.458 --> 51:54.206
and cash a check.

51:54.208 --> 51:56.206
Oh, well, don't worry
about it, Chris.

51:56.208 --> 51:59.125
God made me a trustin' soul
and a good judge of character.

52:01.458 --> 52:05.292
Plus... you look
kind of familiar.

52:13.708 --> 52:16.790
I got it. Paul Newman!

52:16.792 --> 52:19.417
You got the same
gorgeous blue eyes.

52:22.292 --> 52:24.167
God bless your heart.

52:27.750 --> 52:28.833
Yeah, okay.

52:30.833 --> 52:31.875
Serious, but yeah.

52:33.917 --> 52:36.915
Yeah. Guys, you see that?

52:36.917 --> 52:38.706
Guys, watch this.
Watch this.

52:48.375 --> 52:49.790
Oh. I'm sorry.
I-I didn't.

52:49.792 --> 52:51.331
I didn't see you there.

52:51.333 --> 52:53.331
It was my fault.
I wasn't paying attention

52:54.208 --> 52:56.456
Uh, are you moving
into Chez Oaks?

52:56.458 --> 52:58.915
It looks that way.

52:58.917 --> 53:01.706
Well,
welcome to the neighborhood.

53:01.708 --> 53:03.498
I'm Cheryl.

53:03.500 --> 53:06.665
Ah, Chris.

53:09.792 --> 53:11.831
Don't mind them.
They are harmless.

53:11.833 --> 53:13.706
Mm, for the most part.

53:13.708 --> 53:15.623
I'll do my best.

53:15.625 --> 53:19.415
Well, um, if you need anything,
someone's usually always home.

53:19.417 --> 53:20.750
See you around, Chris.

53:43.917 --> 53:45.373
I am a C-H.

53:45.375 --> 53:47.498
I am a C-H-I!

53:47.500 --> 53:49.248
And we'll have CHI-O
in our hearts...

53:49.250 --> 53:51.831
...until the D-A-Y we die!

53:51.833 --> 53:54.081
Whoo!

53:54.083 --> 53:56.456
Look what I found.

53:56.458 --> 54:01.415
Seems Margaret had an
unauthorized visitor last night!

54:01.417 --> 54:03.790
Speak for yourself, Karen.
I use those for dusting!

54:03.792 --> 54:06.623
Sure, you do! Think fast!

54:06.625 --> 54:08.415
Kathy. Kathy!

54:08.417 --> 54:09.748
Kathy! Over here, Kathy!

54:09.750 --> 54:11.623
I'm warning you, Lisa,
give me those back!

54:11.625 --> 54:13.415
Come and get 'em!

54:17.792 --> 54:20.290
Come and get them.

54:20.292 --> 54:22.623
Karen, give those.

54:44.500 --> 54:45.915
Shit.

55:07.000 --> 55:10.623
God, Chris!?

55:10.625 --> 55:13.790
Ju... um, go... go around.

55:13.792 --> 55:17.500
Other-other door.
Other door. Yeah.

55:22.042 --> 55:25.998
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to startle you.

55:26.000 --> 55:28.873
Well, you did.
What are you doing out there?

55:28.875 --> 55:32.373
I was coming by
to let Dottie know

55:32.375 --> 55:35.000
I'm going to be a couple days
behind on the rent.

55:36.708 --> 55:41.665
A job I was expecting
sort of fell through.

55:41.667 --> 55:44.040
Um, she's out
on a date right now

55:44.042 --> 55:47.373
but I'll let her know
when she gets back.

55:47.375 --> 55:48.333
Thank you.

55:50.125 --> 55:51.375
Have a good night.

55:56.708 --> 55:59.583
Chris? Chris!

56:06.917 --> 56:07.875
Hold on one second.

56:18.167 --> 56:20.790
Um.

56:20.792 --> 56:26.623
Dottie made her famous
meatloaf sandwiches tonight.

56:26.625 --> 56:28.542
You look like you could
use a decent meal.

56:32.917 --> 56:34.540
Thank you.

56:34.542 --> 56:35.500
Don't mention it.

56:37.542 --> 56:38.583
Cheryl?

56:42.583 --> 56:46.206
Would you maybe.

56:46.208 --> 56:50.248
like to go to dinner
with me this weekend?

56:50.250 --> 56:55.123
Thank you,
but, uh, I can't.

56:55.125 --> 56:58.081
I have a boyfriend back home.

56:58.083 --> 57:04.708
I was intending as friends,
of course, but I understand.

57:14.042 --> 57:18.542
Well, um, enjoy.
Good night.

58:54.083 --> 58:55.250
Ah!

59:37.792 --> 59:39.000
Why won't you listen to me?

01:01:13.958 --> 01:01:16.373
You can't touch me.

01:01:18.833 --> 01:01:20.706
I'm not here.

01:01:23.375 --> 01:01:25.331
I'm invisible.

01:01:28.333 --> 01:01:36.208
I am no one.

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:54.540
What the hell
is going on, Herb?

01:01:54.542 --> 01:01:56.958
I'm shutting down
the task force.

01:01:58.833 --> 01:02:00.373
What do you mean,
shutting it down?

01:02:00.375 --> 01:02:02.373
Bundy's not our case anymore.

01:02:02.375 --> 01:02:05.831
He is federal jurisdiction.

01:02:05.833 --> 01:02:08.123
But he's still out there.

01:02:08.125 --> 01:02:10.081
He could back here
in Washington, for all we know.

01:02:10.083 --> 01:02:12.331
I can't keep diverting
department resources

01:02:12.333 --> 01:02:14.081
to this case.

01:02:14.083 --> 01:02:17.456
We have a six-month
backload upstairs.

01:02:17.458 --> 01:02:19.165
You've got to let it go.

01:02:19.167 --> 01:02:21.290
Why don't you tell that
to Lynda Healy's parents?

01:02:21.292 --> 01:02:23.415
Why don't you go over
to their house

01:02:23.417 --> 01:02:24.873
and you knock on their door

01:02:24.875 --> 01:02:27.290
and you tell that
to her mother's face?

01:02:27.292 --> 01:02:30.581
Why don't you tell that to
the families of Susan Rancourt,

01:02:30.583 --> 01:02:32.831
of Donna Gail Manson,

01:02:32.833 --> 01:02:35.248
of Brenda Ball,
of Georgeann Hawkins,

01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:36.831
Denise Naslund,
Janice Ott,

01:02:36.833 --> 01:02:39.873
Roberta Parks,
Lynda Healy.

01:02:39.875 --> 01:02:41.790
Tell them.

01:02:41.792 --> 01:02:45.873
Tell them that you no longer
have the department resources

01:02:45.875 --> 01:02:48.248
to go after the man
who raped and strangled

01:02:48.250 --> 01:02:51.248
and mutilated their daughters!

01:02:51.250 --> 01:02:54.498
Your new office
is upstairs on three.

01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:56.998
I am reassigning you to Vice.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.540
Hey, how about that?
Right next to my office.

01:03:00.542 --> 01:03:03.040
You know what?

01:03:03.042 --> 01:03:04.792
Fuck you!

01:03:06.833 --> 01:03:09.167
No, fuck you both!

01:03:16.333 --> 01:03:18.456
Ted Bundy,
a Washington State resident,

01:03:18.458 --> 01:03:20.540
was convicted last year
of the kidnap assault

01:03:20.542 --> 01:03:22.456
of a young woman
from Salt Lake City.

01:03:22.458 --> 01:03:23.498
He's also the prime suspect

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:25.456
in a series of murders
of young women

01:03:25.458 --> 01:03:26.665
in Washington State.

01:03:26.667 --> 01:03:29.290
.as well as the suspect
in a murder case here in Aspen.

01:03:29.292 --> 01:03:31.248
This is Ward Lucas,
reporting from Aspen.

01:03:31.250 --> 01:03:33.040
McChesney.

01:03:33.042 --> 01:03:35.540
Child abduction ten hours ago.

01:03:35.542 --> 01:03:38.040
Ressler, where have you been?

01:03:38.042 --> 01:03:39.206
Tallahassee.

01:03:39.208 --> 01:03:40.331
What's going on there?

01:03:40.333 --> 01:03:42.123
Bundy.

01:03:42.125 --> 01:03:44.040
Less than a week ago,
a female student

01:03:44.042 --> 01:03:45.498
was attacked
by an unknown man

01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:47.623
on the campus of
Florida State University.

01:03:47.625 --> 01:03:49.331
An attempted strangulation.

01:03:49.333 --> 01:03:50.540
Witnesses?

01:03:50.542 --> 01:03:51.873
None who could give
a positive ID.

01:03:51.875 --> 01:03:54.623
The unsub was wearing a mask.
But a college campus?

01:03:54.625 --> 01:03:56.331
Where the winters are warm?

01:03:56.333 --> 01:03:59.165
And get this,
a '68 Volkswagen Beetle

01:03:59.167 --> 01:04:01.290
was reported stolen
by an FSU student

01:04:01.292 --> 01:04:03.123
the same night as the attack.

01:04:03.125 --> 01:04:05.623
Ten a.m. this morning,
12-year-old Kimberly Leach

01:04:05.625 --> 01:04:08.498
missing from her school
in Lake City.

01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:10.498
She was last seen driving away
with a dark-haired man

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:12.956
in a red '68 Beetle.

01:04:12.958 --> 01:04:14.581
Jesus.

01:04:14.583 --> 01:04:16.206
.the area
is just like downtown Aspen.

01:04:16.208 --> 01:04:18.581
A 12-year-old girl?
That's not Bundy's M.O.

01:04:18.583 --> 01:04:20.208
Ann-Marie Burr.

01:04:22.208 --> 01:04:23.623
I'll book the next flight
to Tallahassee.

01:04:23.625 --> 01:04:25.456
I want you
on the ground there too.

01:04:25.458 --> 01:04:27.081
I'll clear it with Swindley.

01:04:27.083 --> 01:04:31.165
No, don't bother.
I've been reassigned.

01:04:31.167 --> 01:04:33.623
- What?
- Yeah. I'll tell you later.

01:04:33.625 --> 01:04:36.665
If you're right, Bundy's
probably coming apart.

01:04:36.667 --> 01:04:38.581
He's been locked up
for two years.

01:04:38.583 --> 01:04:42.290
Now he's a ticking time bomb.

01:04:42.292 --> 01:04:44.040
And there's a quiet
college town in Florida

01:04:44.042 --> 01:04:46.415
that has no fucking idea
what they're dealing with.

01:04:46.417 --> 01:04:47.540
Ted Bundy,
according to Mike Fisher,

01:04:47.542 --> 01:04:49.415
chief investigator
for the DA's office,

01:04:49.417 --> 01:04:51.165
is a dangerous man,

01:04:51.167 --> 01:04:52.998
and the sheriff
was criminally negligent

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.373
for allowing Bundy to escape.

01:04:55.375 --> 01:04:57.373
Meanwhile,
life goes on as usual,

01:04:57.375 --> 01:04:59.581
and single unescorted women
walk the streets,

01:04:59.583 --> 01:05:00.665
presumably unconcerned.

01:05:00.667 --> 01:05:03.248
They apparently
don't know or don't care

01:05:03.250 --> 01:05:05.081
that Ted Bundy
is a chief suspect

01:05:05.083 --> 01:05:08.331
in the murders of at least 18,
possibly 30 young women

01:05:08.333 --> 01:05:09.581
in four states.

01:05:09.583 --> 01:05:12.000
Each of those women
disappeared without a trace.

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:48.708
Chris?

01:06:50.417 --> 01:06:52.456
Chris?

01:06:52.458 --> 01:06:53.625
Anyone home?

01:06:59.333 --> 01:07:00.417
Oh, okay.

01:07:21.125 --> 01:07:22.125
What are you doing in here?

01:07:27.542 --> 01:07:29.540
Can I help you
with something?

01:07:29.542 --> 01:07:30.665
Ah, I just got home,

01:07:30.667 --> 01:07:32.706
and I saw that the door
was open, so.

01:07:32.708 --> 01:07:37.373
So, you decided to come
right on into my apartment?

01:07:37.375 --> 01:07:39.706
No, I just, uh...

01:07:39.708 --> 01:07:41.540
Don't.

01:07:41.542 --> 01:07:45.165
I-I-I wanted to get
Dottie's plate back.

01:07:45.167 --> 01:07:46.623
Plate?

01:07:46.625 --> 01:07:47.831
Yeah.

01:07:47.833 --> 01:07:49.748
The, uh, the-the plate
from last night?

01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:51.250
The one with the sandwiches?

01:07:57.875 --> 01:08:05.833
Oh!
That plate. Excuse me.

01:08:21.250 --> 01:08:22.790
All right, thank you.

01:08:22.792 --> 01:08:24.581
Don't mention it.

01:08:24.582 --> 01:08:26.706
Uh, well,
I-I-I have rehearsal.

01:08:26.707 --> 01:08:29.247
So, I'm-I'm gonna go.

01:08:29.250 --> 01:08:35.790
I found this yesterday.
I thought you might like it.

01:08:35.792 --> 01:08:38.581
Thank you, but
I-I-I can't accept that.

01:08:38.582 --> 01:08:42.667
Sure, you can.
We'll just... shhhh.

01:08:44.832 --> 01:08:46.125
Look at that.

01:08:50.542 --> 01:08:52.290
Isn't that nice?

01:08:55.707 --> 01:08:58.872
And guess what?

01:08:58.875 --> 01:09:02.456
You don't even have to tell
your boyfriend where you got it.

01:10:18.375 --> 01:10:20.706
This key opens
every gate on the campus.

01:10:20.708 --> 01:10:23.040
We got an APB out right now.

01:10:23.042 --> 01:10:25.290
Every department
between here and Pensacola

01:10:25.292 --> 01:10:27.873
is on the lookout for this guy.

01:10:27.875 --> 01:10:30.040
We appreciate your professional
courtesy, Sheriff.

01:10:30.042 --> 01:10:31.456
Thank you.

01:10:31.458 --> 01:10:32.748
I hope you're right
about this.

01:10:32.750 --> 01:10:33.667
I hope we're not.

01:10:52.583 --> 01:10:53.665
Hey, Cheryl, what's up?

01:10:53.667 --> 01:10:55.456
I thought you were going out
dancing at Sherrod's.

01:10:55.458 --> 01:10:57.540
Mm. I'm not feeling up to it.

01:10:57.542 --> 01:10:59.415
What's wrong, honey?
Are-are you sick?

01:10:59.417 --> 01:11:01.581
No, um, I just have a paper
due Monday.

01:11:01.583 --> 01:11:03.540
I really want to get it done.

01:11:03.542 --> 01:11:05.456
I guess we're all staying home
on a Saturday night.

01:11:05.458 --> 01:11:07.417
So much for "Chi till we die".

01:11:10.750 --> 01:11:14.623
From your not-so-secret admirer?

01:11:14.625 --> 01:11:15.831
Ugh. Take it.

01:11:15.833 --> 01:11:18.540
I-I don't ever want to
see that thing again.

01:11:18.542 --> 01:11:22.040
There's something
really off about him.

01:11:22.042 --> 01:11:24.415
Well, you don't have to worry
about creepy Chris anymore.

01:11:24.417 --> 01:11:26.456
He cleared out this morning.

01:11:26.458 --> 01:11:28.540
Dottie was furious,
said he took off

01:11:28.542 --> 01:11:30.500
without ever paying the rent.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Hello?

01:13:46.667 --> 01:13:48.915
Hello?

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.040
Hello?

01:14:13.708 --> 01:14:14.623
I'll meet you down
by the south entrance

01:14:14.625 --> 01:14:17.040
in 20 minutes.

01:14:17.042 --> 01:14:18.458
Hey, be careful.

01:14:47.792 --> 01:14:49.165
This
concludes our program

01:14:49.167 --> 01:14:50.123
scheduled for the day.

01:14:50.125 --> 01:14:51.998
We'll return to the air
tomorrow

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.665
with more
of your favorite programs.

01:14:54.667 --> 01:14:57.748
Ladies and gentlemen,
our national anthem.

01:17:44.083 --> 01:17:47.165
Come on, guys.
I'm trying to sleep.

01:18:58.125 --> 01:18:59.250
No.

01:20:06.458 --> 01:20:09.292
Stop.

01:21:06.583 --> 01:21:07.542
Who are you?

01:21:16.375 --> 01:21:19.208
No!

01:22:39.542 --> 01:22:42.540
Okay. I got you. I got you.

01:22:48.125 --> 01:22:49.623
I got you.

01:22:49.625 --> 01:22:51.581
Come here. I got you.

01:22:51.583 --> 01:22:54.123
Help's on the way, okay?
You're gonna be okay.

01:22:54.125 --> 01:22:55.998
I got you. Come here.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:56.958
Come here.

01:22:59.125 --> 01:23:01.415
Help's on the way. Okay?

01:23:01.417 --> 01:23:04.165
Help's on the way. Okay.

01:24:23.083 --> 01:24:24.375
Ted! Freeze!

01:24:30.250 --> 01:24:31.583
Freeze!

01:25:00.542 --> 01:25:01.540
Dispatch, this is Guzman.

01:25:01.542 --> 01:25:02.915
We got a Code 55.

01:25:02.917 --> 01:25:04.915
Female victim,
severe head trauma,

01:25:04.917 --> 01:25:06.748
possible other victims.

01:25:06.750 --> 01:25:08.456
Send ambulance
and all available

01:25:08.458 --> 01:25:10.498
units to 661 Jefferson.

01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:13.831
The Chi Omega sorority.
Do it now!

01:25:52.708 --> 01:25:54.542
You can't touch me.

01:25:56.333 --> 01:25:59.248
I'm invisible.

01:25:59.250 --> 01:26:05.500
I... am... no one.

01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:20.540
We got you.

01:26:20.542 --> 01:26:21.417
You're gonna be okay, all right?

01:28:33.583 --> 01:28:36.498
What can I do for you,
Det. McChesney?

01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:40.040
It's actually
Special Agent McChesney now.

01:28:40.042 --> 01:28:42.915
Oh, congratulations.

01:28:42.917 --> 01:28:44.625
Thank you.

01:28:47.625 --> 01:28:50.665
But my son is dead now.

01:28:50.667 --> 01:28:53.665
I don't know what more
I could possibly say.

01:28:53.667 --> 01:28:55.165
Before his execution,

01:28:55.167 --> 01:28:57.998
Ted confessed to a number
of murders, Mrs. Bundy.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.667
He led us to more,
several more bodies.

01:29:00.958 --> 01:29:03.831
His confessions
were recorded on tape.

01:29:03.833 --> 01:29:06.706
These tapes are going
to be made public very soon.

01:29:06.708 --> 01:29:09.790
We just thought you might
want to hear them first,

01:29:09.792 --> 01:29:11.000
before anybody else.

01:29:15.667 --> 01:29:17.706
And that little girl,

01:29:17.708 --> 01:29:20.375
my, she screamed
and screamed and screamed.

01:29:21.875 --> 01:29:26.581
And I enjoyed her pain,
her suffering,

01:29:26.583 --> 01:29:32.708
the power I had over her
in those final moments, huh.

01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:35.873
I like to kill.

01:29:37.042 --> 01:29:38.040
I'm the most cold-hearted

01:29:38.042 --> 01:29:40.706
son of a bitch
you'll ever meet.

01:29:40.708 --> 01:29:46.665
And we, we, we serial killers,
we are your sons,

01:29:46.667 --> 01:29:52.581
we are your husbands,
we are everywhere.

01:29:59.750 --> 01:30:02.458
Um.

01:30:06.167 --> 01:30:10.750
How about ice cream
and hot apple pie?

01:30:17.750 --> 01:30:22.000
That's for you.
I made that for you.

01:30:24.083 --> 01:30:35.498
