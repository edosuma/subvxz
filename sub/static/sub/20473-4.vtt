10:49.412 --> 10:51.101
we studied a cup of coffee?

10:51.102 --> 10:54.614
Mileva: You really must sleep, Albert.

10:55.726 --> 10:59.265
Albert: Jacobus v'ant Hoff's
Nobel paper from 1901:

10:59.266 --> 11:02.677
Particles in a solution
behave like a gas.

11:02.678 --> 11:05.069
When sugar dissolves in coffee,

11:05.070 --> 11:07.716
water surrounds glucose and tears it

11:07.717 --> 11:11.101
from the sugar crystal, correct?

11:11.448 --> 11:15.401
The more sugar I add, the
thicker the coffee becomes.

11:15.402 --> 11:17.379
If we can calculate
the osmotic pressure,

11:17.380 --> 11:19.388
perhaps we can deduce the
precise number of

11:19.389 --> 11:22.481
Mileva: You want to prove the
existence of molecules...

11:22.482 --> 11:24.235
Albert: Too ambitious?

11:24.236 --> 11:25.574
Mileva: No.

11:25.575 --> 11:28.322
It's brilliant...

11:47.642 --> 11:50.101
Haller: May I ask you,
what are you doing?

11:50.354 --> 11:52.170
Albert: I'm about to
start work, sir, on a

11:52.171 --> 11:55.295
fascinating application for a...

11:55.296 --> 11:57.401
Nickel-zinc battery.

11:57.402 --> 12:00.307
Haller: That battery was
patented last year, Einstein.

12:00.718 --> 12:01.801
Albert: I beg you.

12:01.802 --> 12:02.981
I'm well ahead of schedule.

12:02.982 --> 12:05.628
If I could be granted the
smallest parcel of time...

12:05.629 --> 12:08.976
Haller: Time, Herr Einstein,
is a privilege you relinquished

12:08.977 --> 12:11.245
when you accepted this position.

12:16.343 --> 12:17.714
Albert: He's a tyrant!

12:17.715 --> 12:19.054
It's unbearable!

12:19.055 --> 12:21.445
He gives me four times the
work as the other dolts

12:21.446 --> 12:22.976
in the office because I'm the only one

12:22.977 --> 12:24.894
who understands mechanical engineering!

12:25.209 --> 12:26.324
Grossmann: Poor thing.

12:26.325 --> 12:27.568
A boss who respects your intellect

12:27.569 --> 12:30.438
and a full time job that
pays twice as much as mine?

12:30.439 --> 12:32.734
Albert: I don't care
about money, Marcel.

12:32.735 --> 12:35.832
I've been toiling in
obscurity for ten hours a day,

12:36.243 --> 12:38.442
six days a week for the past two years

12:38.443 --> 12:42.529
and I never see my family,
I never see my baby.

12:42.749 --> 12:44.470
Grossmann: Albert,
you of all people have

12:44.471 --> 12:46.000
no interest in a baby.

12:46.001 --> 12:47.276
Now what do you want?

12:47.277 --> 12:50.373
Albert: I want what Lorentz
and Becquerel and Lenard have.

12:50.785 --> 12:52.889
Whatever they say, whatever they write,

12:52.890 --> 12:54.004
people pay attention.

12:54.005 --> 12:56.652
I want to wake up in the
morning to pursue my passions

12:56.653 --> 12:59.873
instead of being confronted
with a constant sense of dread

12:59.874 --> 13:01.818
that I, that I'm wasting my life.

13:01.819 --> 13:05.107
Grossmann: I meant what
do you want from me?

13:05.965 --> 13:07.769
Albert: Your father
still has connections

13:07.770 --> 13:09.881
at the patent office?

13:10.832 --> 13:12.298
I need help.

13:12.299 --> 13:16.029
Someone to work alongside me,
to ease my load until I can

13:16.030 --> 13:18.840
make a mark with my ideas.

13:19.092 --> 13:21.200
Grossmann: Do you have
someone particular in mind?

13:23.014 --> 13:25.404
<i>[Laughing].</i>

13:25.405 --> 13:26.903
Besso: I'm very lucky.

13:26.904 --> 13:27.892
It's a good job.

13:27.893 --> 13:29.167
Second class patent clerk in

13:29.168 --> 13:30.539
the mechanical engineering division.

13:30.540 --> 13:33.191
Marie Winteler: Will you
be working with Albert?

13:33.283 --> 13:34.243
Besso: Yes.

13:34.271 --> 13:36.407
In fact, he was
instrumental in helping me

13:36.408 --> 13:37.459
secure the position.

13:37.460 --> 13:39.182
Julius: How does it feel
accepting a favor from the

13:39.183 --> 13:42.243
swine who dishonored
your sister-in-law?

13:42.244 --> 13:44.352
Jost: Julius, please.

13:44.635 --> 13:47.541
Marie Winteler: I think
it's very kind of Albert.

13:48.590 --> 13:51.619
Frau Winteler: Anna, have
you found an apartment?

13:51.620 --> 13:53.085
Anna: Why yes, we have.

13:53.086 --> 13:54.234
Besso: We have.

13:54.235 --> 13:56.498
- It's very modest but...
- Julius: I'd check your walls.

13:56.499 --> 13:57.487
Besso: What?

13:57.488 --> 13:58.229
Julius: Your walls.

13:58.230 --> 14:00.410
You never know what might
be crawling around in them.

14:00.575 --> 14:03.726
Roaches, mice, Lucifer himself.

14:03.978 --> 14:05.125
Jost: Julius, that's enough

14:05.126 --> 14:07.644
Julius: No, the devil is
conspiring to turn this world

14:07.645 --> 14:10.323
into hatred and sin.

14:10.324 --> 14:13.927
His agents are among us.

14:13.928 --> 14:16.164
I hear them.

14:17.053 --> 14:18.938
Open your ears!

14:21.263 --> 14:23.594
Jost: Julius.

14:32.032 --> 14:34.007
Milos: It's growing colder, isn't it?

14:34.008 --> 14:35.538
Mileva: I don't mind.

14:35.539 --> 14:37.101
Milos: You never did.

14:37.102 --> 14:39.365
Do you remember when you
dug a trench in the snow,

14:39.366 --> 14:42.304
covered it with a canvas and
declared it your winter palace?

14:42.618 --> 14:43.798
Mileva: I wanted to sleep there.

14:43.799 --> 14:45.169
But mama wouldn't have it.

14:45.170 --> 14:47.496
Milos: You were always
so independent, Miza.

14:47.497 --> 14:48.868
So strong.

14:48.869 --> 14:50.048
You seem happy again.

14:50.049 --> 14:51.834
Mileva: I am.

14:51.835 --> 14:54.481
Milos: And what about
resuming your studies?

14:54.482 --> 14:56.362
Mileva: I'm working
with Albert every day,

14:56.363 --> 14:59.232
exploring the most
fascinating topics in physics.

14:59.233 --> 15:01.784
I don't need a degree for that.

15:01.785 --> 15:05.041
Milos: And that's
really enough for you?

15:05.452 --> 15:08.803
Mileva: What's bothering you, papa?

15:09.725 --> 15:12.785
Milos: Your mother and I must go home.

15:12.786 --> 15:14.699
Mileva: I don't understand, you said...

15:14.700 --> 15:17.505
Milos: I've been called back to work.

15:17.506 --> 15:20.312
Mileva: But Albert and I are
writing an important paper.

15:20.313 --> 15:22.898
I can't abandon everything
to look after Hans all day.

15:22.899 --> 15:24.915
He only stops crying when
mother holds him, and...

15:24.916 --> 15:27.243
Milos: Don't worry, Miza.

15:27.244 --> 15:30.788
I'll make sure you have
whatever you need...

15:31.741 --> 15:33.685
Mileva: How could you refuse him?

15:33.686 --> 15:35.918
Albert: I didn't marry
you for a dowry, Dollie.

15:35.919 --> 15:38.182
I married you because I love you.

15:38.183 --> 15:39.840
Mileva: It was 20,000 francs!

15:39.841 --> 15:42.327
Albert: Our marriage is
not a business transaction!

15:42.328 --> 15:44.974
You are not a prized heifer
to be bought and sold

15:44.975 --> 15:46.520
Mileva: That's very noble
of you, Albert,

15:46.521 --> 15:48.961
but your lofty principles
will not help me cook, clean,

15:48.962 --> 15:52.086
and raise a child all while
midwifing your papers.

15:52.087 --> 15:53.807
Ow!

15:53.808 --> 15:57.061
<i>[Baby crying]</i>

15:57.062 --> 15:59.967
Pick up the baby, Albert!

16:04.683 --> 16:07.201
How are we to manage?

16:07.202 --> 16:09.562
Albert: Do you think I don't
already have a solution to

16:09.563 --> 16:11.156
that problem, dear Dollie?

16:11.157 --> 16:14.126
I will ask my mother to come.

16:14.824 --> 16:16.844
She knows how to run a household,

16:16.845 --> 16:18.311
how to care for a child,

16:18.312 --> 16:20.000
she will make it possible for you and

16:20.001 --> 16:21.787
I to continue our work.

16:21.788 --> 16:23.636
Mileva: She despises me.

16:23.637 --> 16:25.135
Albert: She doesn't even know you.

16:25.136 --> 16:27.654
And how could she despise
the woman who gave birth

16:27.655 --> 16:30.529
to her only grandson, huh?

16:34.283 --> 16:36.514
Pauline: Look at those cheeks!

16:36.515 --> 16:39.134
He's the spit and image
of his grandfather.

16:39.799 --> 16:41.776
Albert: Dollie, have you seen my tie?

16:41.777 --> 16:43.211
Pauline: I believe I
saw it hanging over

16:43.212 --> 16:44.741
the bathroom door, darling.

16:44.742 --> 16:48.764
We clean up after our husbands
more than our children.

16:50.164 --> 16:52.013
That one is terribly wrinkled.

16:52.014 --> 16:53.384
Don't you have a pressed one?

16:53.385 --> 16:54.691
Albert: It will suffice.

16:54.692 --> 16:57.274
Good day to you Frau Einstein.

16:57.275 --> 16:59.798
And to you Frau Einstein!

17:06.045 --> 17:08.243
Mileva: Thank you for coming.

17:08.244 --> 17:09.903
We do appreciate the help.

17:09.904 --> 17:11.338
Pauline: Of course, darling.

17:11.339 --> 17:13.602
I remember when Albert was born.

17:13.603 --> 17:15.292
Such an exciting time.

17:15.294 --> 17:17.046
But also a difficult one.

17:17.047 --> 17:18.832
I had no idea how to care for myself,

17:18.833 --> 17:20.394
not to mention a child.

17:20.395 --> 17:21.637
Mileva: It isn't easy, is it?

17:21.638 --> 17:24.412
Pauline: Oh, I made so many mistakes!

17:24.413 --> 17:28.143
With any luck I can help
spare you the worst of them.

17:28.144 --> 17:30.025
Mileva: I appreciate that...

17:30.026 --> 17:31.492
Pauline: Of course, darling!

17:31.493 --> 17:33.055
What else am I here for?

17:33.056 --> 17:35.897
Now, shall we go to the
market to stock your pantry?

17:36.308 --> 17:37.998
Mileva: Oh that's very
generous, but I'm afraid

17:37.999 --> 17:39.879
I've got to go to the library.

17:39.880 --> 17:41.952
I was hoping you could look
after Hans for a few hours?

17:41.953 --> 17:44.440
Pauline: But I've only just arrived.

17:44.441 --> 17:46.449
Mileva: Yes, but Albert
and I are finishing

17:46.450 --> 17:47.820
an important paper.

17:47.821 --> 17:50.276
Pauline: Mileva, darling,
if there's one thing

17:50.277 --> 17:53.597
my Albert doesn't need help
with, it's his science.

17:53.784 --> 17:55.377
But with the rest of his life?

17:55.378 --> 17:57.578
He's quite hopeless.

17:57.579 --> 18:00.899
Lucky for him, he has a wife.

18:12.020 --> 18:14.616
Besso: Are you working
with Stokes' law?

18:15.029 --> 18:17.686
Albert: Michele, Haller
despises fraternizing,

18:17.687 --> 18:19.804
and I'm one misstep
away from being ousted.

18:19.993 --> 18:21.496
So if you wouldn't mind...

18:21.497 --> 18:24.926
Besso: Albert, I know why I'm here.

18:25.148 --> 18:27.453
Marcel told me everything.

18:27.454 --> 18:28.573
It's quite all right

18:28.574 --> 18:29.744
I don't mind easing your burden,

18:29.745 --> 18:30.929
and I'm grateful just to have the job.

18:30.930 --> 18:33.719
But of course, I'm curious...

18:35.893 --> 18:37.945
Albert: I'm trying to
prove molecules exist.

18:38.167 --> 18:39.802
<i>[Muffled laugh].</i>

18:41.049 --> 18:42.396
How?

18:44.027 --> 18:47.548
Albert: I'd love to tell you,
but I really need you to review

18:47.549 --> 18:49.437
those applications.

18:49.438 --> 18:51.298
Besso: Of course.

18:51.904 --> 18:54.340
Albert: It really is good
to have you here, Michele.

19:01.638 --> 19:03.851
Pauline: Did you mix in the Castile?

19:04.104 --> 19:05.384
Mileva: Castile?

19:05.385 --> 19:07.145
I, I'm sorry, what is Castile?

19:07.146 --> 19:10.094
Pauline: Soap, dear.

19:11.308 --> 19:12.748
Mileva: Did you tell
your mother why you asked

19:12.749 --> 19:13.997
her to come?

19:13.998 --> 19:15.214
Albert: Of course.

19:15.215 --> 19:17.103
I told her we needed help
with the house and the baby.

19:17.104 --> 19:19.025
Mileva: She seems to believe
her sole purpose is to

19:19.026 --> 19:21.618
instruct me how to cook,
clean, and care for the child.

19:21.619 --> 19:23.699
She's trying to turn
me into a hausfrau.

19:23.700 --> 19:25.333
Albert: She's downstairs
watching the little one

19:25.334 --> 19:26.645
right now, is she not?

19:26.646 --> 19:28.183
Mileva: You must talk to her.

19:28.184 --> 19:30.104
Tell her that our work
together is important.

19:30.105 --> 19:32.249
That my part in it is important.

19:32.250 --> 19:34.810
Albert: I will,
but indulge her a little.

19:34.811 --> 19:36.444
Make her feel appreciated.

19:36.445 --> 19:38.177
Now...

19:38.686 --> 19:40.930
Look.

19:45.699 --> 19:48.932
Mileva: You used Kirchoff's
hydrodynamic techniques...

19:48.933 --> 19:52.362
Albert: Which you introduced
me to at university.

19:53.896 --> 19:56.909
Mileva: My God, Albert...

19:57.226 --> 19:58.859
Laue: Heir professor, Einstein has just

19:58.860 --> 20:00.908
proven the existence of molecules, sir.

20:00.909 --> 20:02.220
Planck: What?

20:02.221 --> 20:03.470
That cannot...

20:03.471 --> 20:04.494
Who did you say?

20:04.495 --> 20:05.647
Laue: Einstein.

20:05.648 --> 20:06.640
The fellow from Bern.

20:06.641 --> 20:07.888
Planck: Bern...

20:07.889 --> 20:09.746
I lectured there recently.

20:09.747 --> 20:11.474
I don't recall any Einstein...

20:11.475 --> 20:12.852
Laue: He's not a professor.

20:12.853 --> 20:14.196
He's a patent clerk.

20:14.197 --> 20:16.374
Planck: A patent clerk.

20:16.375 --> 20:18.359
Besso: It's a brilliant paper, Albert.

20:18.360 --> 20:21.945
I'm sorry you didn't receive
the response you anticipated.

20:21.946 --> 20:23.162
Albert: Apparently, it's not enough to

20:23.163 --> 20:24.667
have an original thought.

20:24.668 --> 20:27.069
The old masters demand data.

20:27.070 --> 20:29.474
Oh well, perhaps the third
time will be the charm,

20:29.760 --> 20:30.751
as they say...

20:30.752 --> 20:31.968
Besso: Third?

20:31.969 --> 20:34.562
My God, Albert, you're
writing another one?

20:34.563 --> 20:35.971
Albert: If I can find
another good idea,

20:35.972 --> 20:38.532
something provable
through experimentation.

20:38.533 --> 20:40.522
Mileva's doing some research for me...

21:31.497 --> 21:33.417
and she leaves all the cleaning to me.

21:33.418 --> 21:34.697
Now is that fair?

21:34.698 --> 21:36.203
Albert: Mother, we spoke about this

21:36.204 --> 21:38.348
Pauline: And I agreed
to indulge the notion that

21:38.349 --> 21:40.717
you could use some
assistance writing your essay

21:40.718 --> 21:42.574
Albert: It's a scientific
paper, mother,

21:42.575 --> 21:44.399
published in a prestigious journal.

21:44.400 --> 21:46.001
Pauline: But you finished it weeks ago

21:46.002 --> 21:48.178
Albert: And now I'm
writing another one.

21:48.179 --> 21:50.100
Pauline: Albert, I don't understand

21:50.101 --> 21:52.149
Albert: I don't expect you to.

21:52.150 --> 21:53.749
Pauline: You have a solid position.

21:53.750 --> 21:55.351
A good income.

21:55.352 --> 21:57.240
Your father would be very proud

21:57.241 --> 21:58.873
Albert: That I'd given up my dreams and

21:58.874 --> 22:00.282
settled for a bourgeois existence?

22:00.283 --> 22:02.780
Pauline: Look at me, darling.

22:02.781 --> 22:04.765
Pursue your dreams if you wish.

22:04.766 --> 22:07.262
But don't give Mileva
false expectations.

22:07.263 --> 22:09.504
I will not be here forever.

22:09.505 --> 22:13.159
She must be taught to run a house.

22:13.379 --> 22:15.784
Albert: I have to go back to work.

22:20.937 --> 22:22.728
Mileva: It's hypnotic...

22:22.729 --> 22:25.675
A single pollen particle is
bombarded by water molecules

22:25.676 --> 22:27.916
ten-to-the-twenty-four
times per second.

22:27.917 --> 22:29.742
Albert: How am I going to
predict that many movements

22:29.743 --> 22:31.887
per second in a three
dimensional space?

22:31.888 --> 22:34.064
Mileva: Here, what
if you tried using...

22:34.065 --> 22:35.921
<i>[Baby crying]</i>

22:35.922 --> 22:37.942
Pauline: Your child needs you, Mileva.

22:39.541 --> 22:40.788
Mileva.

22:40.789 --> 22:41.781
Mileva: Yes one moment,
we're just in the middle of...

22:41.782 --> 22:43.702
Pauline: The baby isn't
crying in a moment.

22:43.703 --> 22:46.172
He's crying now.

22:52.957 --> 22:55.230
Mileva: Frau Einstein, I do appreciate

22:55.231 --> 22:56.542
all you're doing for us.

22:56.543 --> 22:58.336
But right now Albert needs my help.

22:58.337 --> 23:00.322
Pauline: Your boy needs you.

23:00.323 --> 23:02.466
This home needs you.

23:02.467 --> 23:05.125
Mileva: Yes, but at the
moment I'm working...

23:05.126 --> 23:07.718
Pauline: Frankly, my dear,
it is time to put away

23:07.719 --> 23:09.319
such indulgences.

23:09.320 --> 23:13.966
I'm not your maid, nor
your child's wet nurse.

23:22.449 --> 23:25.586
Mileva: You just sit there, silent.

23:25.587 --> 23:27.059
Albert: What do you want me to do?

23:27.060 --> 23:30.841
Mileva: I want you to defend me!

23:52.068 --> 23:56.682
Besso: Early morning or late night?

23:58.825 --> 24:02.121
Albert: I've run away from home.

24:02.122 --> 24:05.007
Besso: Is it really so terrible?

24:05.645 --> 24:07.629
Albert: When my mother
and Mileva are not

24:07.630 --> 24:11.636
at each other's throats, they
take turns lunging at mine.

24:13.202 --> 24:15.059
Besso: Brownian motion.

24:15.060 --> 24:17.076
Very ambitious.

24:17.077 --> 24:19.093
Albert: If I can prove
it mathematically,

24:19.094 --> 24:22.267
it could be confirmed
with the naked eye.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.437
Besso: Well, good luck.

24:26.363 --> 24:28.251
Albert: What?

24:28.252 --> 24:29.564
Besso: What?

24:29.565 --> 24:30.973
Albert: What?

24:30.974 --> 24:32.958
Besso: Nothing.

24:32.959 --> 24:35.203
Albert: What?

24:35.937 --> 24:37.601
Besso: You're making
it too complicated.

24:37.602 --> 24:39.586
Albert: It is ridiculously complicated!

24:39.587 --> 24:42.436
A single pollen particle is
bombarded by water molecules

24:42.437 --> 24:44.389
Besso: Ten-to-the-twenty-four
times per second, yes.

24:44.390 --> 24:45.862
And trying to solve those equations

24:45.863 --> 24:48.812
in three dimensions will drive you mad.

24:49.162 --> 24:51.915
Why not construct a
one-dimensional model.

24:51.916 --> 24:54.928
It's much simpler and would
still prove your thesis.

24:57.519 --> 25:00.500
Albert: Would you be willing
to help me solve it, Michele?

25:09.078 --> 25:11.287
Pauline: My, the weather is turning.

25:11.288 --> 25:13.241
The wind nearly threw me off my feet.

25:13.242 --> 25:14.906
Mileva: You promised
you'd be home an hour ago.

25:14.907 --> 25:16.635
Pauline: Well, I suppose
we all fall short

25:16.636 --> 25:18.523
of expectations now and then.

25:18.524 --> 25:20.129
Mileva: I'm late for Albert.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.472
<i>[Door slams]</i>

25:25.473 --> 25:27.842
Albert: And three-x-by-t-squared equals

25:27.843 --> 25:29.539
r by t-squared...

25:29.540 --> 25:30.916
Besso: And then apply it
back to three dimensions

25:30.917 --> 25:32.068
and the coefficient...

25:32.069 --> 25:33.545
Albert: Michele, you're brilliant!

25:35.944 --> 25:37.736
Mileva: Michele, what a nice surprise.

25:37.737 --> 25:38.889
Sorry I'm late.

25:38.890 --> 25:40.234
Albert: One dimension, Mileva.

25:40.235 --> 25:41.483
Michele's great insight.

25:41.484 --> 25:43.500
We calculate in one dimension!

25:43.501 --> 25:44.941
It's so...

25:44.942 --> 25:45.806
Elegant.

25:45.807 --> 25:47.119
Mileva: I'm not sure I understand...

25:47.120 --> 25:48.751
Albert: Here, pretend I'm drunk.

25:48.752 --> 25:49.872
Mileva: You don't drink.

25:49.873 --> 25:51.057
Albert: Pretend!

25:51.058 --> 25:52.370
If I had as much to drink as Michele,

25:52.371 --> 25:54.227
I'd be staggering everywhere, yes?

25:54.228 --> 25:56.021
Besso: Like pollen
wiggling in the water.

25:56.022 --> 25:57.269
Albert: But where am I going?

25:57.270 --> 25:59.895
To the bar, the toilet, to the street?

25:59.896 --> 26:00.887
Mileva: It's impossible to predict.

26:00.888 --> 26:01.816
We've been over this...

26:01.817 --> 26:03.289
Albert: Precisely.

26:03.290 --> 26:05.915
Michele helped me see that we
can't predict exactly where

26:05.916 --> 26:08.445
I'll go, but using simpler math,

26:08.446 --> 26:12.543
we can calculate how far
I'll go over a period of time.

26:12.544 --> 26:15.073
Besso: Turns out it's
six microns per minute.

26:15.074 --> 26:16.257
Exactly.

26:16.258 --> 26:17.826
Albert: Six microns per minute!

26:17.827 --> 26:20.389
I proved the existence of molecules and

26:20.390 --> 26:21.605
nobody believed me.

26:21.606 --> 26:23.302
And now I've proved how they move,

26:23.303 --> 26:26.732
and it can be confirmed
with an ordinary microscope!

26:28.715 --> 26:30.091
Mileva: That's wonderful...

26:30.092 --> 26:31.952
Besso: To Albert!

26:34.703 --> 26:37.747
Planck: Congratulations,
Philipp, the Nobel prize.

26:42.291 --> 26:44.180
Lenard: You don't have
to be polite, Max.

26:44.181 --> 26:46.422
We both know it was only
a gesture of consolation.

26:46.423 --> 26:48.535
Planck: Well you're still
not sour about Rontgen.

26:48.536 --> 26:49.623
Philipp, that was four years ago.

26:49.624 --> 26:51.544
Lenard: And yet it still stings.

26:51.545 --> 26:53.178
Perhaps if I had received
more recognition

26:53.179 --> 26:54.394
from my colleagues...

26:54.395 --> 26:56.700
Planck: Philipp, you read the journals

26:56.701 --> 26:59.678
your name is invoked
with great regularity.

26:59.679 --> 27:02.496
Lenard: Of course you are right.

27:02.497 --> 27:04.321
This patent clerk in Bern for instance.

27:04.322 --> 27:06.403
He's cited both of us in a paper on...

27:06.404 --> 27:08.195
Planck: Light quanta, yes, indeed.

27:08.196 --> 27:09.700
You see?

27:09.701 --> 27:11.013
I dismissed him at first.

27:11.014 --> 27:12.775
But clearly he's an intellect.

27:12.776 --> 27:15.340
Lenard: He's very clever.

27:15.881 --> 27:20.111
I've been in correspondence
with him in fact.

27:20.653 --> 27:23.666
He wants the footlights,
that much is clear.

27:24.431 --> 27:26.224
I only hope he doesn't
try to take recognition

27:26.225 --> 27:29.141
for your work like Rontgen did to me.

27:32.725 --> 27:35.610
Ein-stein.

27:36.023 --> 27:37.751
It is fascinating what one can deduce

27:37.752 --> 27:41.822
about a man just by knowing his name.

27:50.720 --> 27:52.128
Albert: I don't believe it...

27:52.129 --> 27:53.024
Mileva: What?

27:53.025 --> 27:54.241
Albert: Lenard.

27:54.242 --> 27:55.779
They're giving him the Nobel.

27:55.780 --> 27:57.540
For cathode ray tubes

27:57.541 --> 27:59.205
a ten-year-old innovation.

27:59.206 --> 28:00.774
Mileva: Suddenly you care about awards?

28:00.775 --> 28:02.887
Albert: I care about science
living and breathing

28:02.888 --> 28:05.673
in the present and not
suffocating in the past.

28:05.674 --> 28:07.627
And yes, I'm not ashamed to say,

28:07.628 --> 28:11.826
I want some recognition
for my contributions.

28:12.238 --> 28:14.095
Mileva: I understand how you must feel.

28:14.096 --> 28:15.792
Albert: But here I am,
three published papers,

28:15.793 --> 28:16.817
and nothing to show for it.

28:16.818 --> 28:18.417
It's as if I am...

28:18.418 --> 28:21.080
Mileva: Invisible?

28:29.786 --> 28:32.603
Albert: Perhaps my mother's right.

28:32.604 --> 28:35.837
It's time to put away
such indulgences and concentrate

28:35.838 --> 28:39.555
on what's expected of me.

28:48.646 --> 28:53.833
♪

28:53.834 --> 28:56.298
Haller: Einstein, I need yesterday's...

28:56.299 --> 28:59.408
Albert: Yesterday's,
today's and tomorrow's.

29:04.945 --> 29:06.065
Besso: Where are you going?

29:06.066 --> 29:08.374
Albert: I have no idea.

29:19.163 --> 29:20.991
Besso: Albert?

29:22.972 --> 29:24.253
Albert?

29:24.254 --> 29:25.534
I'm worried about you...

29:25.535 --> 29:27.487
Albert: I approved a
patent for a device

29:27.488 --> 29:30.145
that's now inside that
very clock tower.

29:30.146 --> 29:33.346
Every minute, it sends a
signal at the speed of light

29:33.347 --> 29:37.157
to clocks in Geneva, Basel and
Zurich, synchronizing them.

29:37.158 --> 29:40.199
But what if we sent a signal
to a clock on a moving train?

29:40.200 --> 29:42.217
Besso: Albert, you
could use a good sleep.

29:42.218 --> 29:43.753
Turn your mind off for a bit.

29:43.754 --> 29:44.714
Albert: I can't.

29:44.715 --> 29:45.578
Now listen.

29:45.579 --> 29:47.147
A clock is here, stationary.

29:47.148 --> 29:48.908
And now I attempt to synchronize it

29:48.909 --> 29:49.902
with one that is moving.

29:49.903 --> 29:50.862
What happens?

29:50.863 --> 29:51.983
Besso: The clocks would synchronize.

29:51.984 --> 29:53.584
Albert: Because space
and time are absolute,

29:53.585 --> 29:54.576
according to Newton.

29:54.577 --> 29:55.826
Besso: According to everyone.

29:55.827 --> 29:57.170
Albert: But for that to be true...

29:57.171 --> 29:59.123
Light would have to
speed up or slow down

29:59.124 --> 30:00.756
to keep the clocks synchronized.

30:00.757 --> 30:02.774
But James Clark Maxwell says that light

30:02.775 --> 30:04.215
only moves at one speed.

30:04.216 --> 30:07.160
Now either Maxwell is
correct, or Newton is.

30:07.161 --> 30:08.537
But it can't be both.

30:08.538 --> 30:10.011
Besso: Well if it's a duel
between Newton and Maxwell?

30:10.012 --> 30:12.220
I'm afraid poor Maxwell
gets it between the eyes.

30:12.221 --> 30:13.628
Albert: Maybe so...

30:13.629 --> 30:15.454
Besso: Are you
considering another paper?

30:15.455 --> 30:18.785
Albert: No I'm just thinking, Michele.

30:18.786 --> 30:20.065
Come on.

30:20.066 --> 30:22.178
I'll buy you dinner, and
we can think some more.

30:22.179 --> 30:24.132
The bloated windbags can't
stop us from doing that,

30:24.133 --> 30:26.277
can they?

30:26.278 --> 30:28.198
Besso: Maybe the bloated
windbags can't stop us.

30:28.199 --> 30:30.023
But Anna can.

30:30.024 --> 30:33.101
You know the Winteler rules:
Never miss a family meal.

30:38.478 --> 30:39.598
Jost: Julius!

30:39.599 --> 30:40.623
Your eggs are getting cold!

30:40.624 --> 30:41.872
Marie Winteler: Must we
do this every morning?

30:41.873 --> 30:44.241
Frau Winteler: The doctor says
routine is important for him.

30:44.242 --> 30:46.610
Marie Winteler: Well, I can't
keep my students waiting...

30:46.611 --> 30:48.408
Jost: Julius, come and eat!

30:53.272 --> 30:55.837
Sit down.

30:56.090 --> 30:58.911
Eat your breakfast.

31:03.071 --> 31:04.190
Frau Winteler: Julius.

31:04.191 --> 31:05.471
Julius: Death to satan's messengers!

31:05.472 --> 31:06.976
Jost: No.

31:06.977 --> 31:08.225
Marie Winteler: Julius!

31:08.226 --> 31:09.378
Jost: No.

31:09.379 --> 31:11.399
Marie Winteler: My God,
what are you doing?

31:13.221 --> 31:15.081
No.

31:20.329 --> 31:23.179
Minister: O God, who
brought us to birth,

31:23.180 --> 31:29.715
and in whose arms we die, in
our grief and shock comfort us;

31:29.968 --> 31:33.008
give us hope in our confusion and grace

31:33.009 --> 31:36.435
to enter a new life;
Through Jesus Christ.

31:36.436 --> 31:37.556
Amen.

31:37.557 --> 31:39.221
All: Amen.

31:39.222 --> 31:41.046
Pauline: That poor family.

31:41.047 --> 31:42.712
I should be at the funeral.

31:42.713 --> 31:45.017
Mileva: You are free
to go, Frau Einstein.

31:45.018 --> 31:46.073
Pauline: No, no, my dear.

31:46.074 --> 31:49.599
I couldn't possibly leave
you alone with the child.

31:50.077 --> 31:52.446
Mileva: If I really am
so unfit to be a mother,

31:52.447 --> 31:55.584
you could have gone to Aarau
and Albert could have stayed

31:55.585 --> 31:58.341
home with me.

31:58.498 --> 32:00.162
Pauline: No, my dear.

32:00.163 --> 32:04.105
Albert is exactly where
he needs to be right now.

32:11.915 --> 32:14.252
Marie Winteler: Do you
remember what you promised me...

32:14.253 --> 32:16.557
When you left for university?

32:16.558 --> 32:18.383
Albert: I...

32:18.384 --> 32:20.881
I don't, I'm sorry.

32:20.882 --> 32:22.577
Marie Winteler: You
said you would come up

32:22.578 --> 32:25.976
with a formula to freeze time.

32:28.630 --> 32:31.131
Albert: I'm afraid I'm...

32:31.736 --> 32:34.653
I'm not as brilliant
as I thought I was...

32:42.431 --> 32:45.312
I'm sorry, Marie.

32:45.313 --> 32:47.174
For everything.

32:52.998 --> 32:54.570
Man: So sorry.

32:54.983 --> 32:56.712
Marie Winteler: Talk to him.

32:56.713 --> 32:59.886
He misses you.

33:07.984 --> 33:10.929
Albert: Jost, I am so deeply...

33:10.930 --> 33:16.185
Jost: Sorry, yes, everyone says that.

33:18.903 --> 33:21.884
Albert: Is there
anything that I can do?

33:27.132 --> 33:30.113
Jost: You are an intelligent man.

33:30.431 --> 33:33.924
So perhaps you can explain to me this:

33:34.594 --> 33:39.784
How could my bright, beautiful son

33:41.670 --> 33:45.260
so suddenly turn into a monster?

33:46.889 --> 33:50.607
What did I do wrong?

33:52.333 --> 33:55.827
Albert: You musn't blame yourself.

33:57.168 --> 34:01.010
I wish I could be half
the father that you are.

34:01.011 --> 34:05.496
Jost: Yes, I heard you had a son.

34:09.272 --> 34:12.313
Hold him tight, Albert.

34:12.315 --> 34:16.351
You think his childhood
will last forever,

34:17.310 --> 34:22.851
but I promise you, it will
pass in a fraction of a second.

34:44.239 --> 34:46.703
Mileva: You said you'd
be home last night.

34:46.704 --> 34:48.625
Albert: I'm sorry.

34:48.626 --> 34:50.770
By the time it seemed
appropriate to leave,

34:50.771 --> 34:52.659
I'd already missed my last train.

34:52.661 --> 34:54.453
Mileva: Of course you did.

34:54.454 --> 34:56.952
I'm sure you were terribly
disappointed to have to spend

34:56.953 --> 34:58.538
the night with your beloved Wintelers.

34:58.539 --> 35:00.561
Albert: Mileva, please,
they're grieving...

35:00.562 --> 35:02.010
Pauline: I can take him, dear.

35:02.011 --> 35:04.686
Mileva: Don't touch my son.

35:04.687 --> 35:06.197
Pauline: I'm only trying to help.

35:06.198 --> 35:07.961
Mileva: You've been shoving
your 'help' down my throat

35:07.962 --> 35:09.000
since you arrived.

35:09.001 --> 35:10.543
Albert: Mileva, calm yourself.

35:10.544 --> 35:12.684
Mileva: That's quite easy
for you to say, isn't it?

35:12.685 --> 35:14.637
You do what you want,
go where you please.

35:14.638 --> 35:16.054
And I'm here.

35:16.055 --> 35:17.314
Not in a laboratory or

35:17.315 --> 35:18.730
in front of a classroom
as I should be...

35:18.731 --> 35:20.588
Pauline: Perhaps I'm mistaken,

35:20.589 --> 35:22.635
but didn't you fail your exams?

35:22.636 --> 35:23.706
Albert: Mother, please

35:23.707 --> 35:25.375
Pauline: The girl needs to
face the truth, Albert.

35:25.376 --> 35:27.044
You need a wife to
make you a home, not a...

35:27.045 --> 35:29.406
Mileva: I'm sorry
I'm not Marie Winteler.

35:29.407 --> 35:31.584
Pauline: So am I.

35:34.477 --> 35:35.861
Albert: Mother, apologize.

35:35.862 --> 35:38.349
Pauline: I knew from the
moment my son wrote to me

35:38.350 --> 35:41.597
about you, you would never
make him a suitable wife.

35:42.885 --> 35:45.597
Mileva: Albert didn't marry me
because he wanted a housewife.

35:47.387 --> 35:49.313
We're partners.

35:49.498 --> 35:51.448
Pauline: Darling, open your eyes.

35:51.449 --> 35:52.960
You are not his partner.

35:52.961 --> 35:55.102
You are his librarian.

35:55.103 --> 35:57.689
You are his clerk.

36:00.109 --> 36:02.979
Albert: Mother, you should go.

36:03.920 --> 36:05.525
Pauline: Go, go where?

36:05.526 --> 36:08.176
Albert: Home.

36:09.872 --> 36:14.033
Pauline: If you think this
creature can make you happy,

36:14.374 --> 36:20.110
then I promise you, son, you
are in for a life of misery.

36:22.688 --> 36:28.014
<i>[Baby crying]</i>

36:35.961 --> 36:41.256
<i>[Baby crying]</i>

36:41.598 --> 36:44.480
Mileva: He won't sleep.

36:44.481 --> 36:47.911
I don't know what to do...

36:48.261 --> 36:51.243
Albert: Go to bed, Dollie.

36:52.297 --> 36:55.087
I can take him.

36:55.917 --> 36:57.777
Mileva: Thank you...

37:00.241 --> 37:03.027
Albert: I made you something.

37:03.028 --> 37:05.045
Choo-choo, choo-choo.

37:05.046 --> 37:07.191
It's a train, yes.

37:07.192 --> 37:09.145
I was on one of these this morning,

37:09.146 --> 37:12.060
and I couldn't wait to
get home to see you.

37:12.061 --> 37:15.747
Papa Jost told me
that time is fleeting;

37:16.706 --> 37:19.428
we think moments like
these will last forever,

37:19.429 --> 37:22.667
but in fact they'll
pass in a split second.

37:23.849 --> 37:27.788
It's a nice sentiment, but
you and I both know that time

37:27.789 --> 37:30.514
can't move at different speeds.

37:38.071 --> 37:42.944
<i>[Ticking clock]</i>

37:47.873 --> 37:50.728
Unless...

37:52.647 --> 37:54.988
Unless it could.

37:56.555 --> 37:58.928
Oh my...

37:59.694 --> 38:02.964
Albertli, you've done it!

38:09.079 --> 38:10.648
I've completely solved the problem.

38:10.649 --> 38:12.602
Besso: What are you talking about?

38:12.603 --> 38:13.531
Albert: Close your eyes.

38:13.532 --> 38:16.546
Pretend you're overlooking
a train track...

38:16.735 --> 38:18.848
Imagine a train racing past,

38:18.849 --> 38:21.383
faster than any train you've ever seen.

38:23.173 --> 38:26.536
Now, I want you to imagine,
as the train is flying past,

38:26.537 --> 38:28.715
two lightning bolts
crashing beyond the tracks

38:28.716 --> 38:30.929
at the same time 100 meters apart.

38:34.353 --> 38:35.858
Besso: So what?

38:35.859 --> 38:37.268
Albert: Patience.

38:37.269 --> 38:38.965
Now imagine that you're
standing in the middle of the

38:38.966 --> 38:41.175
train during the exact same scenario.

38:41.176 --> 38:43.674
Would the lightning
bolts be simultaneous?

38:43.675 --> 38:45.083
Besso: Of course.

38:45.084 --> 38:47.422
Albert: Not if light
moves at one speed.

38:47.423 --> 38:48.414
Close your eyes.

38:48.415 --> 38:49.408
Besso: Albert, this is ridiculous...

38:49.409 --> 38:51.170
Albert: Put yourself
back on the moving train,

38:51.171 --> 38:52.227
and really think about it.

38:52.228 --> 38:54.826
Do it, Michele!

39:00.492 --> 39:02.449
Now watch the lightning bolts!

39:06.065 --> 39:09.304
Were they simultaneous to you?

39:09.653 --> 39:11.062
Besso: No!

39:11.063 --> 39:13.464
Albert: Because you were
moving towards one and away

39:13.465 --> 39:15.614
from the other.

39:16.540 --> 39:19.522
To me, standing still,
they were simultaneous.

39:19.808 --> 39:22.081
How could the two of us experience

39:22.082 --> 39:23.843
the same event differently?

39:23.844 --> 39:25.765
Besso: We couldn't.

39:25.766 --> 39:27.495
Unless...

39:27.496 --> 39:29.897
Albert: It's not Maxwell who
gets it between the eyes.

39:29.898 --> 39:31.887
It's Newton.

39:32.076 --> 39:33.485
Besso: What are you saying?

39:33.486 --> 39:39.636
Albert: Time is not absolute.

39:39.637 --> 39:41.397
Besso: Holy hell.

39:41.398 --> 39:42.614
Albert: I'm writing the paper, Michele.

39:42.615 --> 39:44.760
I dare them to ignore it.

39:44.761 --> 39:46.686
<i>[Laughing].</i>

39:47.869 --> 39:49.441
Ha!

39:52.609 --> 39:57.193
<i>[Coughing]</i>

39:57.383 --> 39:58.887
Pierre: Marie.

39:58.888 --> 40:01.710
Come see what we've found...

40:03.020 --> 40:05.618
Don't look.

40:17.851 --> 40:19.708
You believed it would be 1,000 times

40:19.709 --> 40:21.630
stronger than uranium.

40:21.631 --> 40:23.681
This element is a
million times stronger,

40:23.682 --> 40:26.627
and it's not even pure.

40:26.628 --> 40:29.703
Marie: It's beautiful.

40:29.704 --> 40:32.044
Pierre: What shall we call it, my love?

40:36.591 --> 40:38.644
Marie: Radium.

40:40.018 --> 40:44.057
Albert: Dollie, Dollie, you're awake!

40:44.471 --> 40:45.911
Thank God.

40:45.912 --> 40:49.146
Since I first imagined riding
alongside a light beam,

40:49.147 --> 40:50.748
it's been bothering me.

40:50.749 --> 40:52.958
How could light freeze in time?

40:52.959 --> 40:54.688
Well, it couldn't!

40:54.689 --> 40:57.090
Mileva: You're gone before I
wake, home after I'm asleep.

40:57.091 --> 40:59.237
Do I not at least deserve a "hello?"

40:59.238 --> 41:01.415
Albert: Hello, my darling
Mileva, now listen...

41:01.416 --> 41:05.419
300 years ago, Galileo devised
his principle of relativity...

41:05.420 --> 41:07.917
Now Newton built on these theories

41:07.918 --> 41:10.800
to devise his own laws;
motion, gravitation,

41:10.801 --> 41:11.922
and absolute time.

41:11.923 --> 41:13.107
Mileva: I know all of that.

41:13.108 --> 41:15.253
Albert: But neither man
took into account

41:15.254 --> 41:16.887
the true nature of light.

41:16.888 --> 41:20.510
So, I've devised my own
principle of relativity.

41:28.996 --> 41:30.597
Mileva: Lorentz transformations?

41:30.598 --> 41:32.198
Albert: Yes.

41:32.199 --> 41:34.569
He saw time dilation as
a mathematical quirk.

41:34.570 --> 41:35.946
It's not.

41:35.947 --> 41:37.644
The faster we move through space,

41:37.645 --> 41:40.559
the slower we move through time.

41:40.560 --> 41:42.161
Mileva: It is extraordinary, Albert...

41:42.162 --> 41:43.826
Albert: It's more than that.

41:43.827 --> 41:47.578
It's the redefinition of the universe.

41:47.767 --> 41:48.888
All the work.

41:48.889 --> 41:49.848
All the late nights.

41:49.849 --> 41:51.226
This, Mileva.

41:51.227 --> 41:53.821
This is what we've been chasing...

41:53.822 --> 41:56.063
Will you proof it for me?

41:56.064 --> 41:57.697
Mileva: Am I your clerk?

41:57.698 --> 41:59.170
Is that it?

41:59.171 --> 42:01.220
Albert: No, of course not, Dollie.

42:01.221 --> 42:04.043
You're my partner.

42:08.237 --> 42:10.834

42:23.772 --> 42:26.943
I just received a
letter from Stockholm.

42:26.944 --> 42:31.715
You are to be awarded the 1903
Nobel prize in physics for your

42:31.716 --> 42:35.435
contributions to the research
of radiation phenomena.

42:37.771 --> 42:40.464
A hearty congratulations, Pierre.

42:42.287 --> 42:45.874
Pierre: Will my wife be
given the prize, as well?

42:45.875 --> 42:49.814
Dean: Pierre, we all know
madame Curie has been

42:49.815 --> 42:51.608
a valuable assistant.

42:51.609 --> 42:54.363
But it's the tools you invented

42:54.364 --> 42:57.053
that are responsible for
discovering radium.

42:57.054 --> 43:01.670
Pierre: No, no, tools
don't make discoveries, doctor.

43:02.661 --> 43:04.165
People do.

43:04.166 --> 43:06.535
Madam Curie and I are partners.

43:06.536 --> 43:08.329
Please inform the Nobel
committee that I will not

43:08.330 --> 43:11.953
accept the prize if they do
not honor my wife alongside me.

43:21.783 --> 43:24.313
Mileva: "The introduction
of a luminiferous ether

43:24.314 --> 43:26.556
will prove to be superfluous."

43:26.557 --> 43:27.581
Superfluous!

43:27.582 --> 43:28.894
I love that word.

43:28.895 --> 43:31.073
Albert: I preferred
'idiotic', but alas.

43:31.074 --> 43:33.379
Mileva: "In conclusion, I wish
to say that in working at the

43:33.380 --> 43:35.685
problem here dealt with, I
have had the loyal assistance

43:35.686 --> 43:39.080
of my friend and colleague M. Besso...

43:39.081 --> 43:41.483
And that I am indebted
to him for several

43:41.484 --> 43:44.498
valuable suggestions."

43:46.289 --> 43:48.210
You thank Michele.

43:48.211 --> 43:49.427
Albert: Of course I thanked him.

43:49.428 --> 43:51.285
His advice was instrumental.

43:51.286 --> 43:53.432
Mileva: But I've helped
you with so many papers.

43:53.433 --> 43:55.033
Including this one.

43:55.034 --> 43:57.980
Albert: Of course you have.

43:57.981 --> 44:01.668
Mileva: But you never thought
to put my name in any of them.

44:01.953 --> 44:05.639
Albert: Well, I suppose
it never occurred to me...

44:07.270 --> 44:11.213
Mileva: No, I don't suppose it did...

44:12.267 --> 44:15.374
Albert: No, because in my
heart, the two of us are one.

44:15.375 --> 44:16.687
It's our name.

44:16.688 --> 44:19.762
Einstein, 'one stone.'

44:19.763 --> 44:24.475
this paper, every paper,
it's both of us.

44:25.049 --> 44:27.162
I couldn't do any of it without you.

44:27.163 --> 44:28.988
You know that.

44:28.989 --> 44:31.903
Mileva: No one else does.

44:31.904 --> 44:34.502
Albert: Mileva.

44:40.936 --> 44:44.527
Mileva: You're going to
be late for work, Albert.

44:57.018 --> 44:59.355
Laue: His fourth paper this year.

44:59.356 --> 45:00.732
I haven't seen anything like this

45:00.733 --> 45:02.110
since Newton's annus mirabilis.

45:02.111 --> 45:04.576
Planck: Doctor Laue, are
you honestly comparing

45:04.577 --> 45:06.754
Einstein to sir Isaac Newton?

45:06.755 --> 45:08.841
Laue: Read it.

45:10.151 --> 45:12.136
Planck: He provides no footnotes.

45:12.137 --> 45:14.218
Laue: That's because he
has answered a question

45:14.219 --> 45:16.785
no one was asking.

45:27.128 --> 45:28.409
Herr Einstein?

45:28.410 --> 45:30.458
Max Laue, I work for
Professor Max Planck at the

45:30.459 --> 45:31.484
Prussian Academy.

45:31.485 --> 45:32.349
A sincere pleasure to...

45:32.350 --> 45:34.979
Haller: I believe you're
looking for him.

45:36.450 --> 45:38.115
I've tried to get him to brush his hair

45:38.116 --> 45:39.653
and smarten himself up.

45:39.654 --> 45:42.571
But the man is hopeless.

45:48.174 --> 45:50.415
Laue: Albert Einstein?

45:50.416 --> 45:52.337
Author of the principle of relativity?

45:52.338 --> 45:54.547
Albert: Well, Galileo is the author

45:54.548 --> 45:55.892
of the principle of relativity.

45:55.893 --> 45:58.231
I simply provided a revision.

45:58.232 --> 45:59.929
Laue: My, you are modest.

45:59.930 --> 46:02.304
Besso: He most certainly is not.

46:02.653 --> 46:06.592
Laue: May I ask why you are
working at a patent office?

46:06.593 --> 46:09.895
Albert: History is full
of bad jokes, I suppose.

46:10.212 --> 46:12.101
Laue: My name is Max Laue.

46:12.102 --> 46:15.725
I am here at the behest
of Professor Max Planck.

46:16.491 --> 46:17.867
Besso: Max Planck?

46:17.868 --> 46:19.212
The father of Prussian physics?

46:19.213 --> 46:21.423
Laue: He greatly admires
your work, Herr Einstein.

46:21.424 --> 46:23.409
You've achieved more in one
year than most scientists do

46:23.410 --> 46:24.786
in a lifetime.

46:24.787 --> 46:27.413
However did you accomplish it?

46:27.414 --> 46:29.431
Albert: Curiosity, I suppose.

46:29.432 --> 46:30.744
Besso: That and he
wanted to be noticed.

46:30.745 --> 46:32.410
Laue: Well, you've succeeded.

46:32.411 --> 46:34.300
We would like to help
you further your career.

46:34.301 --> 46:36.190
Tell me, are you working
on anything else?

46:36.191 --> 46:38.144
Albert: Uh, yes, in fact.

46:38.145 --> 46:40.899
I've realized that the
relativity principle,

46:40.900 --> 46:42.693
combined with the Maxwell's equations,

46:42.694 --> 46:44.935
requires that mass be a direct measure

46:44.936 --> 46:47.017
of the energy contained in a body.

46:47.018 --> 46:49.611
Laue: I'm not sure I follow...

46:49.612 --> 46:52.275
Albert: Light carries mass.

46:52.848 --> 46:55.858
Laue: But that's impossible.

46:55.859 --> 46:56.816
Albert: Perhaps!

46:56.817 --> 46:57.511
For all I know,

46:57.512 --> 46:59.850
the good lord might be
laughing at the whole matter.

46:59.851 --> 47:01.643
I believe this theory
could be tested using

47:01.644 --> 47:04.037
elements whose energy
is highly unstable.

47:04.038 --> 47:06.924
Madame Curie's radium, for example...

47:08.907 --> 47:11.441
Laue: Herr Einstein, it's...

47:16.051 --> 47:19.722
It's genius.
