03:01.148 --> 03:02.514
Tell us the whole story.

03:02.516 --> 03:06.285
Um, last Wednesday,
I came downstairs,

03:06.287 --> 03:08.453
he opened the doors...

03:08.455 --> 03:09.821
There's champagne, ring,

03:09.823 --> 03:11.857
everything, and

Anthony Hamilton in our
living room, (Lucious laughs)

03:14.395 --> 03:16.028

03:16.030 --> 03:17.663
Oh, it was beautiful.

03:17.665 --> 03:19.965

you come to my house

to that bitch?

07:19.773 --> 07:21.373
talking about
this is an emergency.

07:21.375 --> 07:23.608

shake me down

07:23.610 --> 07:25.877
for three million dollars.

07:25.879 --> 07:29.381
What...
what am I supposed to do?

07:29.383 --> 07:30.882
You're supposed to pay the man!

07:30.884 --> 07:33.118
Pay him for what?
For wasting his life?!

07:33.120 --> 07:35.420
He hated you, man,
he hated me,

07:35.422 --> 07:36.955
'cause we did something
with ourselves.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.124
So, you play God?!
No, he played God

07:39.126 --> 07:42.994
the moment he showed up here
and tried to shake me down!

07:42.996 --> 07:45.964
He chose his fate.

07:45.966 --> 07:50.101
He wasn't the Bunkie
you and me grew up with.

07:50.103 --> 07:51.970
He talked
about tearing this down,

07:51.972 --> 07:53.738
everything I done built?

07:54.740 --> 07:56.608
Everything that we've built--

07:56.610 --> 07:58.243
he was gonna tear it down.

07:58.245 --> 08:00.912
You should have come
to me sooner.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.914
What am I gonna say to you, V?

08:02.916 --> 08:04.850
Look, I'm about to kill Bunkie?

08:04.852 --> 08:07.486
I shot him.

08:12.692 --> 08:15.861
Now, how are we
gonna fix this, man?

08:15.863 --> 08:18.363
I'll tell you
what we gonna do.

08:18.365 --> 08:21.132
First thing we gonna do is
beef up security.

08:21.134 --> 08:23.768
That's first.
I've been talking to a guy

08:23.770 --> 08:25.971
that's supposed to be
the best in the business.

08:25.973 --> 08:29.307
We gonna go to work,

08:29.309 --> 08:31.776
we gonna act like
everything is normal.

08:31.778 --> 08:34.579
And that's how
we gonna work this.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.900
Now you listen me.
I'm not approving

08:54.902 --> 08:56.468
any production cost overruns
this quarter, okay?

08:56.470 --> 08:58.537
Now, the closer
we get to this IPO launch,

08:58.539 --> 08:59.871
the more critical... One second.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.973
...the more critical...
Hey, what the...?

09:03.376 --> 09:04.843
Tell me the truth.

09:04.845 --> 09:06.711
You knew that Lucious killed
Bunkie, and you lied

09:06.713 --> 09:10.181
to protect him, didn't you?
You're supposed to have my back.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.384
Right? That's the deal, right? I don't
know what you're talking about.

09:12.386 --> 09:15.720
I sat there and listened
to you give a false alibi.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.389
That's what I do.

09:17.391 --> 09:19.758
I give my father alibis.

09:20.526 --> 09:23.261
(coughing)

09:23.263 --> 09:25.564
What the hell is wrong
with you, Andre?

09:25.566 --> 09:27.999
Nothing wrong with me.
What's wrong with you?

09:28.001 --> 09:30.335
Hmm?

09:30.337 --> 09:34.439
I cover for him, even when
I don't know what I'm covering.

09:43.349 --> 09:45.283
So, I think the next thing
that needs to happen is

09:45.285 --> 09:47.419
we just need to ex out
the things that are cheesy.

09:47.421 --> 09:49.387
All of this girl
is not working for me.

09:49.389 --> 09:51.957
(phone ringing) I actually...
Oh, hold on one second.

09:51.959 --> 09:54.059
Hey, babe. What's up?

09:54.061 --> 09:58.129
I was right about what happened
with Bunkie, Rhonda.

09:59.131 --> 10:00.799
Oh, okay.

10:00.801 --> 10:04.202
Well, um, I'm so happy
to hear that great news.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.805

you can talk?

10:06.807 --> 10:09.708
No, I can't right now,
but I'm really

10:09.710 --> 10:11.710

listening to Cookie?

10:25.459 --> 10:26.891
She was just being honest.

10:26.893 --> 10:28.293
Michael,
what you want me to do?

10:28.295 --> 10:30.061
You want me to swear
on a stack of Bibles

10:30.063 --> 10:31.730
that I'm never gonna blow up
and leave you behind?

10:31.732 --> 10:34.599
All right, since when
do you talk to me like that?

10:34.601 --> 10:36.835
Listen, all I want
is to make sure

10:36.837 --> 10:38.303
that we're still
each other's priority.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.639
Is that too much to ask?
No, it's not. Come here.

10:40.641 --> 10:42.507
No. Jamal...
Babe, come here, come on.

10:42.509 --> 10:46.277
Come on. Let's go away
for the weekend,

10:46.279 --> 10:48.413
show Cookie how wrong she is.

10:48.415 --> 10:50.315
For real?

10:50.317 --> 10:52.684
You come first.
You know that.

10:52.686 --> 10:55.453
First<i> and</i> second

10:55.455 --> 10:57.422
Why don't we go

10:57.424 --> 10:59.290
to that bed-and-breakfast place
in the Berkshires?

10:59.292 --> 11:00.959
The one that Kenny
and John told us about.

11:00.961 --> 11:03.995
Supposed to be super secluded,
no cell phone, no Internet,

11:03.997 --> 11:07.332
no nothing. just you and I. Babe, I can't
be off the grid like that right now.

11:07.334 --> 11:08.442
Come on, don't get mad,
it's a lot happening

11:08.467 --> 11:09.501
right now. All right,
all right, all right.

11:09.503 --> 11:11.536
Okay, I'm not mad. I'm cool.

11:11.538 --> 11:13.738
Just as long as we're together.

11:16.375 --> 11:19.210
Let's just hit up Fire Island
with R.J. and Taylor.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.914
That sounds cool.

11:26.552 --> 11:29.187
A bad week
just got worse.

11:29.189 --> 11:33.191
Well, sobriety's a journey,
not a destination.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.527
You know,
you commit your life

11:35.529 --> 11:40.632
to another man
and his mission...

11:40.634 --> 11:43.568
You know, I practically
raised that man's kids.

11:43.570 --> 11:46.571
So what's changed?
Why's it getting to you now?

11:46.573 --> 11:49.307
A guy we grew up with
got killed.

11:49.309 --> 11:51.743
I mean, he was like
a brother to us.

11:51.745 --> 11:54.279
He lived for Lucious.

11:55.414 --> 11:57.215
Is that a worthy life?

11:57.217 --> 12:01.686
Waking up every day to
serve another man's needs?

12:01.688 --> 12:04.689
If it's time to move on,

12:04.691 --> 12:06.891
maybe it's time.

Oh, I assumed it was a demo.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.724
You would, because
you're a hater.

12:39.726 --> 12:41.059
See, this is the problem...
Uh, sorry to interrupt.

12:41.061 --> 12:42.360
Just needed to remind
your department

12:42.362 --> 12:44.395
about the new IPO mandate of

12:44.397 --> 12:45.930
cutting fat from
the artist roster.

12:45.932 --> 12:47.565
We're on it.
Um, we are dropping

12:47.567 --> 12:49.067
Alonzo Hall,

12:49.069 --> 12:51.136
Elle Dallas is going and
the Shadow Brothers as well.

12:51.138 --> 12:53.371
Wait, wait, you're
cutting Elle Dallas?

12:53.373 --> 12:56.307
Yes, we are. That's the
dumbest thing I ever heard.

12:56.309 --> 12:58.810
Empire can't cut Elle Dallas.

12:58.812 --> 13:01.613
She is Empire royalty.

13:01.615 --> 13:04.816
Yeah, well, maybe she was,
back in your day, but...

13:04.818 --> 13:07.452
Mom, she's costing
Empire a fortune.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.788
We haven't seen a new revenue
stream from her in years.

13:09.790 --> 13:10.955
And she is difficult.

13:10.957 --> 13:13.124
Yeah, difficult.
I know that word.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.794
You see, y'all like
to toss us to the side

13:15.796 --> 13:17.796
when you can't
control us anymore

13:17.798 --> 13:21.332
because you're lazy and you
don't want to do your job.

13:21.334 --> 13:24.068
Well, just because you don't
know what to do with an A-lister

13:24.070 --> 13:26.004
doesn't mean we toss her
from the label.

13:26.006 --> 13:29.340
No, there is no "we", Cookie.
This is my lane. Mine.

13:29.342 --> 13:31.142
Okay.

13:32.778 --> 13:35.346
COOKIE:
<i> You know the song is good.</i>

13:35.348 --> 13:37.615
You mean the three-and-a-
half-minute piece of crap

13:37.617 --> 13:39.651
that he keeps telling me
to kiss his ass?

13:39.653 --> 13:41.953
(laughs) Yeah, that's song.
It's not funny.

13:41.955 --> 13:43.688
Look, it's going to be a hit.

13:43.690 --> 13:45.423
That's all that matters.

13:45.425 --> 13:48.026
What matters is the fact that
I came down here personally

13:48.028 --> 13:50.662
to introduce you to Elle Dallas,

13:50.664 --> 13:53.865
and all you can do is jam
Jamal down my throat?

13:53.867 --> 13:56.434
Like he said in his song--
keep your money?

13:56.436 --> 13:58.269
That's what I'm gonna do--
I'm gonna keep my money.

13:58.271 --> 14:01.472
Yeah. Well, the only reason
why you're giving me Elle

14:01.474 --> 14:03.041
is because you feel guilty

14:03.043 --> 14:05.210
about leading me on with
the damn rose.  No.

14:05.212 --> 14:07.478
No, you misunderstood the rose.
Oh, man, please.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.547
But I can't wait till
Elle is in your hands,

14:09.549 --> 14:11.482
'cause you gonna have
your hands filled.

14:11.484 --> 14:13.551
Anika thinks
she's hopeless.

14:13.553 --> 14:16.554
Elle's music gave me
a reason to stay alive

14:16.556 --> 14:18.156
when everything else
was telling me

14:18.158 --> 14:21.025
to just give up and... die.

14:21.027 --> 14:23.161
No, she got anger,
you know, that anger

14:23.163 --> 14:25.330
that makes you just
want to fight.

14:25.332 --> 14:26.397
That's...
Well, here she comes.

14:26.399 --> 14:27.732
Oh, my God.

14:29.034 --> 14:31.169
LUCIOUS: Maybe you
can return the favor,

14:31.171 --> 14:34.239
because she needs
the life-saver now.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.374
Elle.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.343
Lucious.
Look at you.

14:38.345 --> 14:40.078
ELLE:
Doll, good to see you.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.479
Hi. Elle.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.047
I know exactly who you are.

14:43.049 --> 14:44.816
I'm Cookie. Your biggest fan.

14:44.818 --> 14:47.151
Wait. Cookie.
You're the wife.

14:47.153 --> 14:48.419
Ex-wife.

14:48.421 --> 14:50.421
Darling, don't be shy.

14:50.423 --> 14:52.290
We're all somebody's ex-wife.

14:53.392 --> 14:54.993
LUCIOUS: I have the most
incredible news.

14:54.995 --> 14:58.563
Cookie has agreed to manage you

14:58.565 --> 15:00.098
and take over the production

15:00.100 --> 15:01.332
of your next album.

15:01.334 --> 15:02.867
Uh-uh, Lucious.
Forget it.

15:02.869 --> 15:04.936
I-I'm sorry, I only
work with top people.

15:04.938 --> 15:07.572
That's how I sold over
100 million records.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.841
But in the last five years,
it's been none.

15:09.843 --> 15:13.011
That's, like, maybe the
audience has forgotten you.

15:14.546 --> 15:17.882
Okay, here's what you will
get with me:

15:17.884 --> 15:20.952
someone who
appreciates your gift

15:20.954 --> 15:22.854
and who knows
what to do with it.

15:22.856 --> 15:24.956
I won't sleep until
you're back on the charts.

15:24.958 --> 15:27.358
I tell you,
Cookie is your best bet.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.861
I mean, she's been
begging to manage you,

15:29.863 --> 15:33.131
she's your biggest fan
and she's hungry.

15:33.133 --> 15:35.066
I need a real producer.

15:35.068 --> 15:36.534

15:43.076 --> 15:46.711

it was my record sales

15:46.713 --> 15:48.780

22:10.930 --> 22:12.897
You know how it is.

22:14.099 --> 22:15.800
It's amazing what good music

22:15.802 --> 22:18.269
will have these young girls
doing nowadays.

22:18.271 --> 22:20.938

That's nasty.  Porsha.

That girl is...
This song is going to be

22:28.114 --> 22:29.447
a monster hit.

22:29.449 --> 22:30.648
Why don't you be the first one

22:30.650 --> 22:32.116
to introduce it to the world?

22:33.518 --> 22:37.388
I'm only doing this
because you two are hilarious.

22:39.057 --> 22:41.292
What's the name of the song?

22:41.294 --> 22:44.028
It says you were awarded
the Silver Star of Excellence

22:44.030 --> 22:48.065
for courage while under fire
stationed in Iraq?

22:48.067 --> 22:50.534
Yes, sir. I was there
for four years

22:50.536 --> 22:53.537
as team leader
of a tactical recovery platoon.

22:53.539 --> 22:55.673
What did you recover?

22:55.675 --> 22:58.075
That's classified, sir.

22:58.077 --> 22:59.677
(chuckles)

22:59.679 --> 23:02.079
I have 12 years' experience
as a Navy Seal

23:02.081 --> 23:04.248
specializing
in close quarter combat,

23:04.250 --> 23:07.551
hostage rescue/recovery,
and antiterrorism.

23:07.553 --> 23:09.153
I've overseen
personal security

23:09.155 --> 23:10.821
for figures such as yourself,

23:10.823 --> 23:12.390
executives, religious leaders,

23:12.392 --> 23:15.760
and others who face
high-stakes security challenges.

23:17.229 --> 23:20.731
You know, my company's
in the middle of an IPO launch.

23:20.733 --> 23:23.367
Yes, sir. It's a great time
to beef up your security.

23:23.369 --> 23:25.870
A lot of friends,
but I got a whole lot of enemies

23:25.872 --> 23:28.105
that would love
to see this IPO not happen.

23:28.107 --> 23:30.541
Well, I've done
a thorough review

23:30.543 --> 23:33.110
of both your home
and your corporate headquarters.

23:33.112 --> 23:35.446
Really?
Yes, sir.

23:35.448 --> 23:36.714
What'd you find?

23:36.716 --> 23:38.682
That this entire
building and your home

23:38.684 --> 23:40.785
are one giant breach.

23:40.787 --> 23:44.054
What do you mean?

23:44.056 --> 23:45.389
Your security cams are misplaced

23:45.391 --> 23:47.625
with black holes
about a mile wide,

23:47.627 --> 23:49.226
the northwest gate
sensor can be tripped

23:49.228 --> 23:50.694
by anybody with a cell phone,

23:50.696 --> 23:53.130
Hell, no. and the
night security detail

23:53.132 --> 23:54.899
looks more
like a donut commercial

23:54.901 --> 23:58.602
than a threat deterrent.
I would start from scratch, sir.

23:58.604 --> 24:00.604
I like how you do your recon.

24:00.606 --> 24:02.106
Let's get you to work, sir.

what if I knew a way

29:30.736 --> 29:33.103

29:42.113 --> 29:44.081
(sighs)

29:44.083 --> 29:46.917
So what in the world
can you do for me, Doc?

29:46.919 --> 29:48.819
And I don't want no BS.

29:48.821 --> 29:51.455
I've looked high and low to find
somebody, and you might be the guy.

29:51.457 --> 29:54.291
Well, as you know,
I'm a concierge doc.

29:54.293 --> 29:57.161
That means
I'm your doctor exclusively.

29:57.163 --> 29:58.996
I have no
other patients.

29:58.998 --> 30:02.299
My every waking moment will be
devoted to your well-being.

30:02.301 --> 30:03.967
Yeah, well,
you can the hand-holding

30:03.969 --> 30:05.235
and the bedside manner.

30:05.237 --> 30:08.172
I've been told ALS has no cure.

30:08.174 --> 30:10.140
That's why you need me, Lucious.

30:12.477 --> 30:16.446
The FDA puts tighter
restrictions on new medications

30:16.448 --> 30:18.448
than any other country
in the world.

30:18.450 --> 30:22.252
But in Russia,
the ease of regulations

30:22.254 --> 30:25.455
has created a breeding ground
for cutting-edge treatments.

30:25.457 --> 30:27.624
They're making tremendous
strides in ALS.

30:27.626 --> 30:30.027
Are they?

30:30.029 --> 30:32.429
They have a new drug
cocktail which has shown

30:32.431 --> 30:34.598
a 60% reduction
in symptoms,

30:34.600 --> 30:37.334
and all the people taking it
are still living.

30:37.336 --> 30:39.703
Now, the-the sample
size is small,

30:39.705 --> 30:41.705
so the data is far
from conclusive,

30:41.707 --> 30:45.475
but we're cautiously optimistic
that this is a breakthrough.

30:45.477 --> 30:47.110
So how do I get in?

30:47.112 --> 30:49.179
It's not gonna
be cheap.

30:49.181 --> 30:52.950
Come on, come on. The-the Russian
medical community is as corrupt

30:52.952 --> 30:55.519
as the rest of the country--
it's like the Mob.

30:55.521 --> 30:56.987
Yeah, and like
the music business.

30:56.989 --> 30:58.655
I don't care the cost.

30:58.657 --> 31:02.159
Whatever has to happen,
I need you to make that happen.

31:02.161 --> 31:04.394
I want in.

Someone came in late.
Wait, no.

31:37.763 --> 31:39.730
Nobody came in late, E.
Let's just reset.

31:39.732 --> 31:41.698
I know what I heard.
One of these women threw me off.

31:41.700 --> 31:43.934
You know what, please leave.
I-I'm done.

31:43.936 --> 31:46.169
And, Kevin,
get me a cigarette.

31:46.171 --> 31:47.738
(sighs)

31:47.740 --> 31:49.172
Can you call the driver?

31:49.174 --> 31:51.275
Kevin, sit down.

31:51.277 --> 31:54.244
It wasn't them, Elle.
(sighs)

31:54.246 --> 31:57.047
It's you. Y-You're just not
bringing it, baby.

31:57.049 --> 31:59.883
This song just isn't you.
You gotta be raw.

31:59.885 --> 32:02.886
Fine. You know
what the stupid song needs,

32:02.888 --> 32:04.588
you sing it!

32:05.590 --> 32:06.890
(sighs)
All right.

32:06.892 --> 32:08.258
All right, everybody out.

32:08.260 --> 32:09.426
Everybody out.

32:09.428 --> 32:11.328
Y'all stay.

32:12.797 --> 32:14.197
Give us a minute, sweetheart.

32:14.199 --> 32:15.365
Mm-hmm.

32:16.567 --> 32:18.936
I do know what the song needs.

32:18.938 --> 32:21.705
It needs for you to stop
pretending to be who you used to be

32:21.707 --> 32:23.273
and be who you are now.

32:23.275 --> 32:24.808
This tantrum you're throwing,
put it in the song.

32:24.810 --> 32:26.310
That's what I've been doing.
No.

32:26.312 --> 32:28.245
You're hiding.

32:28.247 --> 32:29.746
You're hiding
behind the mix,

32:29.748 --> 32:32.382
behind those fake-ass
samples and reverb,

32:32.384 --> 32:36.219
behind that fur and...
all that makeup.

32:36.221 --> 32:38.455
Take it off.

32:38.457 --> 32:40.057
Get out of here, Cookie.
You know what?

32:40.059 --> 32:41.792
I can take care of this
all by myself.

32:41.794 --> 32:43.260
I'm not playing, Elle.

32:43.262 --> 32:44.494
Take it off.

32:44.496 --> 32:47.097
You need to sing
about your pain

32:47.099 --> 32:49.633
as the real you, or it
ain't never gonna work.

32:49.635 --> 32:51.768
Take it off.

32:51.770 --> 32:53.470
Do you know
who you're talking to?

32:53.472 --> 32:55.739
I had the highest-selling
debut album

32:55.741 --> 32:58.408
in the history of this company.
I built this place.

32:58.410 --> 33:00.610
But I am fighting for
a comeback, too, Elle.

33:00.612 --> 33:03.680
It is do-or-die for me, too.

33:03.682 --> 33:05.415
Okay?

33:05.417 --> 33:09.786
Now, let's do this together,
but we-we gotta do it right.

33:09.788 --> 33:11.588
I'm all you got.

33:12.623 --> 33:14.424
Trust me.

33:14.426 --> 33:16.360
Take it off.

33:19.464 --> 33:21.031
Hmm.

33:21.033 --> 33:22.933
Yes. All of it.

33:22.935 --> 33:24.201
That's right.

33:24.203 --> 33:25.602
Fine.

33:26.537 --> 33:29.406
(chuckles)

33:32.643 --> 33:34.211
You happy?

33:34.213 --> 33:36.847
Get rid of those
fake-ass eyelashes.

33:54.365 --> 33:55.966
Okay, come on.
All right.

33:55.968 --> 33:57.401
Come on, let's get something.

33:57.403 --> 34:01.071
All right, uh,
let's try it from the bridge.

35:59.158 --> 36:01.591
Have a seat, bro.

36:01.593 --> 36:05.162
Oh, that's Jamal Lyon,
up-and-coming R&B star.

36:05.164 --> 36:06.930
He just gave you
an exclusive peek

36:06.932 --> 36:08.165
of his brand-new joint.

36:08.167 --> 36:09.866
It's called
"I Wanna Love You."

36:09.868 --> 36:12.869
I know you guys felt it,
because your boy Sway felt it.

36:12.871 --> 36:16.139
And, man, I gotta tell you, bro,
that-that song is a banger.

36:16.141 --> 36:18.008
Thank you, man.
I appreciate that. Thank you.

36:18.010 --> 36:20.477
Absolutely, man. So-so what's
the deal with you, brah?

36:20.479 --> 36:23.013
You got... "Keep Your Money"
is starting to get traction.

36:23.015 --> 36:26.116
Yeah. I think "I Wanna Love
You" is simply gonna explode.

36:26.118 --> 36:29.486
And soon, Jamal Lyon's
gonna be a contender.

36:29.488 --> 36:32.122
(laughing) So how does
your lady feel about that?

36:32.124 --> 36:33.390
Uh... (laughs)

36:33.392 --> 36:37.027
Um...

36:37.029 --> 36:40.997
I-I mean...
who says I have a lady?

36:40.999 --> 36:43.900
(Jamal laughs) SWAY: Wait. Wait.
Hold up, man. You're gonna tell me

36:43.902 --> 36:46.469
there's no special girl
in your life?

36:49.240 --> 36:51.808
Uh, honestly, no.
I'm... I'm just...

36:51.810 --> 36:53.877
I'm really in love
with my music right now.

36:53.879 --> 36:55.478
No one special.

it here first, ladies.

Commissioner Marshall.

37:18.570 --> 37:21.438
Thank you. I know it doesn't
bring your friend back.

37:21.440 --> 37:23.974
No, but at least justice
is getting served.

37:26.744 --> 37:28.345
I owe you.

37:28.347 --> 37:30.981
How do I pay you back?

37:45.963 --> 37:48.798
So, how you doing, Vernon?

37:48.800 --> 37:51.067
Still thinking
about quitting?

37:51.069 --> 37:53.069
Hell no.

37:53.071 --> 37:56.206
I tell you now, things are
gonna be a lot different.

37:59.610 --> 38:01.444
All right.
You okay?

38:01.446 --> 38:04.047
Yeah, I'm good.

38:05.650 --> 38:08.218
Doctor, how do we know
that this is gonna be safe?

38:08.220 --> 38:10.654
It's already been approved...

38:10.656 --> 38:12.822
for phase two trials in Moscow.

38:12.824 --> 38:14.557
Phase one

38:14.559 --> 38:16.393
showed excellent results.

38:16.395 --> 38:18.461
Okay. You're not answering
my question.

38:18.463 --> 38:20.897
I can't give you
the answer that you want.

38:20.899 --> 38:25.835
It's an experimental drug,
but the... the reality is...

38:25.837 --> 38:27.704
I am dead without it.

38:30.474 --> 38:33.076
What is all of this?
I.D., please?

38:33.078 --> 38:35.245
What do you mean you
need to see my I.D.?

38:35.247 --> 38:37.414
Do you know who I am?
Of course I know

38:37.416 --> 38:39.649
who you are, Ms. Lyon, but
there's new security protocol.

38:39.651 --> 38:42.252
I don't care about no new security.
I'm sorry, Ms. Lyon.

38:42.254 --> 38:43.820
They're just following the
instructions that I gave them.

38:43.822 --> 38:45.255
I'm Malcolm DeVeaux,

38:45.257 --> 38:46.790
Empire's new head of security.

38:46.792 --> 38:48.591
Oh. Good.

38:48.593 --> 38:50.493
Okay. Hi.

38:50.495 --> 38:52.195
Hi... Mrs. Lyon.

38:52.197 --> 38:53.863
Oh, please, call me Cookie.

38:53.865 --> 38:56.866
Cookie, until the system
is up and running,

38:56.868 --> 38:59.035
we're double-checking I.D.'s of
anyone coming in the building.

38:59.037 --> 39:00.704
It's for your safety.

39:00.706 --> 39:03.106
Okay. Why didn't you say that?
Here, let me get you my I.D.

39:03.108 --> 39:05.375
Oh... p-please.

39:05.377 --> 39:06.643
(beep)

39:06.645 --> 39:09.346
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

39:10.514 --> 39:13.316
I feel safer already,
Mr. DeVeaux.

39:13.318 --> 39:14.718
(chuckles)

39:17.688 --> 39:19.589
(clicks tongue)

39:22.860 --> 39:24.794
Just so we're clear,

39:24.796 --> 39:26.563
I didn't know
what my dad did.

39:26.565 --> 39:29.899
I gave him an alibi because
that's what I've always done.

39:29.901 --> 39:31.534
I guess we're both guilty

39:31.536 --> 39:33.837
of putting ourselves
on the line for that man.

39:33.839 --> 39:35.538
My father lied to you.

39:35.540 --> 39:37.974
That is something
I have never done.

39:37.976 --> 39:40.176
You're right.

39:40.178 --> 39:43.913
I apologize for
choking you out.

39:43.915 --> 39:46.383
Team Andre.

39:46.385 --> 39:48.985
You wash your hands first.

39:50.087 --> 39:52.522
I know it's a lot
for you to deal with.

39:52.524 --> 39:55.492
It just means we're gonna
move faster on our plan.

39:55.494 --> 39:57.927
One more thing.

39:57.929 --> 40:00.430
You ever put your
hands on me again,

40:00.432 --> 40:03.066
I will slit your throat.

40:05.936 --> 40:09.472
You just make sure you keep
taking those meds, boy.

All right, listen,

40:58.123 --> 40:59.422
Okay, this is your brand.

40:59.424 --> 41:00.990
And the good thing
about this song is

41:00.992 --> 41:02.492
it's gonna generate
enough controversy,

41:02.494 --> 41:03.927
so we won't even need
the promotion spend.

41:03.929 --> 41:06.229
Oh...!

41:06.231 --> 41:09.265
JAMAL: Y'all forgetting
one thing, though.

41:09.267 --> 41:10.834
You write a song
about how much you hate women,

41:10.836 --> 41:12.602
it makes you look
like a little bitch.

41:12.604 --> 41:15.004
I don't hate no woman who
ain't did me wrong first.

41:15.006 --> 41:16.940
LUCIOUS: And when this
song drops, the majority

41:16.942 --> 41:18.975
of the people on the dance
floor is gonna be women.

41:18.977 --> 41:20.743
Exactly. Anybody with common
sense can see that the lyrics

41:20.745 --> 41:23.713
are just metaphors. Just
drop the damn song.

41:25.282 --> 41:26.649
(sighs)

41:26.651 --> 41:29.085
I really hope that,
when you become a star,

41:29.087 --> 41:32.088
you can finally let go
of all this childish anger.

41:32.090 --> 41:33.256
Become?

41:33.258 --> 41:35.859
I'm already a star, Cookie.

41:42.266 --> 41:43.800
Y'all want to meet me
in the car?

41:43.802 --> 41:45.502
Okay. We'll wait.

41:47.605 --> 41:49.038
Oh, how sweet.

41:49.040 --> 41:51.007
Just one big
happy family, huh?

41:51.009 --> 41:53.042
Nobody's expecting you? No, nobody's
expecting me, but it's okay,

41:53.044 --> 41:55.211
because if you just tell them
that Olivia is here,

41:55.213 --> 41:57.113
Right... so let me... they'll know me.
I've-I've known them forever.

41:57.115 --> 41:59.349
Just wait right here. I'll...
Okay. Thank you. Thank you.

41:59.351 --> 42:01.384
Mr. Lyon?
Um, I need to see you.

42:01.386 --> 42:04.153
There's someone over here claiming
to be a relative. OLIVIA: Hi.

42:04.155 --> 42:05.154
Hi.

42:05.156 --> 42:06.489
Hi!
You know her?

42:06.491 --> 42:07.724
Yeah.  OLIVIA: Hey, everybody.

42:07.726 --> 42:09.025
GUARD: Wait, please.  Hey!

42:09.027 --> 42:10.860
Hey, wait...
Hi. Hi, everybody.

42:10.862 --> 42:13.730
Hello. Long time, no see.

42:13.732 --> 42:15.698
Hey, Jamal.

42:17.134 --> 42:18.401
What's up, Olivia?

42:18.403 --> 42:19.736
What you doing here?

42:19.738 --> 42:21.538
We heard you on the radio.

42:21.540 --> 42:23.573
Your song-- they will not
stop playing it,

42:23.575 --> 42:25.842
and Lola knows all the words.
Sing the song.

42:25.844 --> 42:30.013
Um... ♪ Dol-dol,
dollar bill ♪ um...

42:30.015 --> 42:33.349
(whispering)

42:33.351 --> 42:36.819
♪ Do-do-dollar bill, everybody
lookin' for somethin'. ♪

42:36.821 --> 42:39.556
(laughing)

42:40.724 --> 42:42.559
She wanted to meet her daddy.

42:46.096 --> 42:49.465
