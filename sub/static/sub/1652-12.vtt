00:03.770 --> 00:05.571
        - They're doing
     the race registration

00:05.573 --> 00:06.572
       Over in "a" wing.

00:06.574 --> 00:09.308
          - Thank you.

00:09.310 --> 00:11.010
    - This is my niece zoe.

00:11.012 --> 00:12.478
  - Do you want to go see them
       unload the animals

00:12.480 --> 00:13.479
      For the petting zoo?

00:13.481 --> 00:15.781
       [children giggle]

00:15.783 --> 00:18.584
          - [echoing]
   hey, I like the balloons.

00:18.586 --> 00:20.486
          [explosion]

00:20.488 --> 00:23.756
    [overlapping screaming]

00:23.758 --> 00:26.558
    Girls, can you hear me?

00:26.560 --> 00:31.230
    - Every bit of training
 we've had was for today, boys.

00:31.232 --> 00:33.432
   - If there's one car bomb,
   there's probably a second.

00:33.434 --> 00:36.535
      - It looks just like
         oklahoma city.

00:36.537 --> 00:37.770
       - Where's dawson?

00:37.772 --> 00:41.040
       - She went inside.
      - Dawson's in there?

00:41.042 --> 00:43.308
           - [gasps]
        - are you okay?

00:43.310 --> 00:45.677
    - Yeah, it's--it's just
       a little scratch.

00:45.679 --> 00:48.247
           - Imogene!
    We need help over here!

00:48.249 --> 00:50.482
        - Gabby! Hello?

00:50.484 --> 00:52.818
   - She's only 9 years old!

00:52.820 --> 00:55.354
          - You came.

00:55.356 --> 00:57.356
  - We found our second bomb.

00:57.358 --> 00:59.391
     - Shay, we got dawson.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.427
             Shay?

01:03.563 --> 01:04.596
            - Help!

01:04.598 --> 01:07.633
  We need some help over here!

01:07.635 --> 01:10.135
         - Oh, my god.

01:13.339 --> 01:15.174
        - Oh, she's lost
        a lot of blood.

01:15.176 --> 01:17.409
        Help me get her
    into one of these bays.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.278
          - All right.

01:23.516 --> 01:25.117
   - I'm going to need to get
        an I.V. Started.

01:25.119 --> 01:26.785
         - Right away.

01:33.526 --> 01:37.329
        [sirens wailing]

01:37.331 --> 01:41.200
     - First bomb detonated
     8:00 a.M. On the dot.

01:41.202 --> 01:43.602
      Second bomb located
        in a rental car.

01:43.604 --> 01:46.238
      Car is still there.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.640
   - Who dismantled the bomb?
           - We did.

01:48.642 --> 01:52.344
     If they got anything,
  I want to be notified first.

01:52.346 --> 01:53.545
            - Yeah.

01:53.547 --> 01:56.782
   - How many confirmed dead?
          - 18 dead...

01:56.784 --> 02:00.352
   15 in critical condition,
  3 employees unaccounted for.

02:00.354 --> 02:02.688
          The sign-ups
      for the charity race

02:02.690 --> 02:04.756
        Had just started
   before the bomb detonated.

02:04.758 --> 02:08.160
   We may have more civilians
   buried beneath the rubble,

02:08.162 --> 02:10.562
    But there's no real way
     of knowing right now.

02:10.564 --> 02:12.698
 - Fbi special agent in charge
      wants all the bosses

02:12.700 --> 02:14.600
     In the command center.

02:14.602 --> 02:17.336
 - All right, everybody inside.

02:17.338 --> 02:20.572
          - Voight...

02:20.574 --> 02:23.308
       Animals did this.

02:26.679 --> 02:28.313
        - We'll get 'em.

02:30.183 --> 02:32.184
     [indistinct shouting]

02:32.186 --> 02:33.919
             - Hey.
             - Hey.

02:33.921 --> 02:35.454
          - Anything?

02:35.456 --> 02:38.423
  - Not much left to recover,
    but we're still digging.

02:38.425 --> 02:41.627
          - All right.

02:41.629 --> 02:43.328
     - You know who did it?

02:43.330 --> 02:45.297
          - No, we're
     just getting started.

02:45.299 --> 02:47.466
          - Find 'em.

02:54.374 --> 02:58.177
           - Call out
      if you can hear me!

02:58.179 --> 02:59.678
 - Who do we talk to first, al?

02:59.680 --> 03:01.780
    - Whoever was closest to
 the blast and is still alive.

03:01.782 --> 03:03.248
     - Intelligence, c.P.D.

03:03.250 --> 03:06.318
      [indistinct chatter]

03:14.527 --> 03:15.861
 - Quiet then, okay, everybody,
           listen up.

03:15.863 --> 03:18.897
           Listen up!

03:18.899 --> 03:20.632
        [chatter stops]

03:20.634 --> 03:22.201
   My name is william graff.

03:22.203 --> 03:23.802
       I'm with the fbi.

03:23.804 --> 03:25.237
     I need all your help,

03:25.239 --> 03:27.673
  And I know you're all eager
         to provide it.

03:27.675 --> 03:30.309
         First rule...

03:30.311 --> 03:31.843
  Everything goes through me.

03:31.845 --> 03:35.547
    Okay, I want to go over
    what we know right now.

03:35.549 --> 03:38.350
    [heart monitor beeping]
  - blood pressure coming up.

03:38.352 --> 03:39.952
       - Any word on zoe?

03:39.954 --> 03:41.453
           - Nothing.

03:44.557 --> 03:47.593
   - Vital signs are stable,
       no brain activity.

03:50.363 --> 03:54.700
  - Keep her on life support.
I need to go talk to her sister.

03:59.472 --> 04:01.373
       - Anything on zoe?
           - Not yet.

04:03.509 --> 04:05.510
           - Holly...

04:05.512 --> 04:09.881
           - [softly]
            oh, no.

04:09.883 --> 04:12.351
            [crying]

04:13.786 --> 04:15.387
     I've made this speech.

04:15.389 --> 04:16.822
             [sobs]

04:16.824 --> 04:19.791
       Don't say anymore.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.392
            Oh, god.

04:21.394 --> 04:23.996
           [sniffles]
            oh, god.

04:23.998 --> 04:27.032
        - Your sister's
        still breathing,

04:27.034 --> 04:31.637
   But there's been no brain
    activity for some time.

04:31.639 --> 04:34.406
       - So she's alive.

04:37.043 --> 04:39.444
    I'm going to go see her.

04:40.380 --> 04:42.314
        - Alim al safir,

04:42.316 --> 04:44.683
 Ambassador from syria, is here
 for an off-the-books surgery.

04:44.685 --> 04:46.351
    My office and the office
     of greg simpson at cia

04:46.353 --> 04:48.387
Will be spearheading this angle,

04:48.389 --> 04:50.389
 But if you encounter anything
     that waves near this,

04:50.391 --> 04:52.758
           Notify me.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.493
      - I was going to do
       the transplant...

04:54.495 --> 04:56.361
  - On the syrian ambassador?

04:56.363 --> 04:59.031
      Did you see anything
   that looked out of place?

04:59.033 --> 05:01.400
        Do you remember?

05:01.402 --> 05:04.069
     - Oh, he had his guys.
            - Guys?

05:04.071 --> 05:06.338
     - He's an ambassador.
          He has guys.

05:06.340 --> 05:07.706
   And the next thing I knew,

05:07.708 --> 05:10.809
        The ground shook
   like it was an earthquake.

05:10.811 --> 05:13.545
     I thought for a second
  I was back in san francisco.

05:13.547 --> 05:16.348
     - Dr. Willhite, 7632.

05:16.350 --> 05:20.052
      Dr. Willhite, 7632.
          - All right.

05:20.054 --> 05:22.421
   - We also have an orderly
         who works here

05:22.423 --> 05:26.525
       With distant ties
   to a radical muslim group.

05:26.527 --> 05:29.394
      - I can't help you.
        I didn't do it.

05:29.396 --> 05:31.697
    I didn't see who did it,
     and I've got to focus

05:31.699 --> 05:34.032
       On what I can do,
         which is save

05:34.034 --> 05:37.336
    As many lives and limbs
       as I possibly can.

05:37.338 --> 05:40.706
     - I got it. Thank you.
          - All right.

05:40.708 --> 05:43.909
    - There were two guys--
 baseball caps on, sunglasses.

05:43.911 --> 05:45.410
       I noticed because
   everyone else was walking

05:45.412 --> 05:47.112
        Toward the tent
    to sign up for the race.

05:47.114 --> 05:49.781
        - And what else
   did you notice about them?

05:49.783 --> 05:53.418
         - Tan skin...
   Olive, dark hair for sure.

05:53.420 --> 05:56.621
  But could have been hispanic
      or arab or italian.

05:56.623 --> 05:57.589
         I don't know.

05:57.591 --> 06:00.425
          - Excuse me.
          Agent graff?

06:00.427 --> 06:02.661
     Sergeant hank voight,
      intelligence, c.P.D.

06:02.663 --> 06:03.929
        - How you doing?

06:03.931 --> 06:07.099
    Securing the perimeter,
 conducting interviews. Thanks.

06:07.101 --> 06:09.634
  - My unit is gonna be doing
      a hell of a lot more

06:09.636 --> 06:12.904
Than interviewing hospital staff
    and setting out pylons.

06:12.906 --> 06:16.141
   This happened in my city,
          on my soil.

06:19.412 --> 06:21.413
      Don't get in my way.

06:28.921 --> 06:29.154

06:39.533 --> 06:41.700
   - Sweeping the whole area.

06:41.702 --> 06:44.136

     a few minutes, billy.

06:44.138 --> 06:46.037
      - Catch these guys.

06:46.039 --> 06:48.006

    a white four-door sedan

07:07.694 --> 07:10.128
And head out the southeast exit
          of the lot.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.830
  And we have security video?

07:11.832 --> 07:13.432
     - The security office
    was in the impact zone.

07:13.434 --> 07:15.567
       Database is gone,
        as in <i> gone</i> gone.

07:15.569 --> 07:19.070
Was rented out of some dirt-lot
     company in milwaukee.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.772
  The name and the credit card
    on the rental agreement

07:20.774 --> 07:22.974
 And there's no security video
        at the company,

07:22.976 --> 07:24.543
     Or so they're saying.

07:24.545 --> 07:28.480
  - Sumner, you dealt with all
 those antigovernment nutcases

07:28.482 --> 07:29.548
     When you were working
           undercover

07:29.550 --> 07:33.618
        - That's right.
 - All right, beat the bushes.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.754
   - Hey, guys, I just heard.

07:35.756 --> 07:36.688
        Burgess was here
       when it happened,

07:36.690 --> 07:39.825
 And her niece is in the I.C.U.

07:41.861 --> 07:43.995
           - How bad?
          - Not good.

07:50.770 --> 07:53.672
             - Hey.

07:56.776 --> 07:58.944
         - It's zoe...

07:58.946 --> 08:03.782
          She's, um--
      she's an only child.

08:03.784 --> 08:05.884
 Her--my sister and her husband
        are out of town.

08:05.886 --> 08:08.887
        That's why she's
        staying with me.

08:08.889 --> 08:10.489
       And now imogene...

             - Hi.

08:16.263 --> 08:19.531
             - Hey.

08:23.936 --> 08:26.972
        - We just heard.
       What did they say?

08:26.974 --> 08:29.774
      - A ruptured liver.

  or something, a donor list.

08:33.580 --> 08:35.746
    They're trying to match.

    - Do we know who did it?

08:37.583 --> 08:40.217
     Anybody taking credit?

08:40.220 --> 08:44.656
  The lab got a print off the
 duct tape of bomb number two.

     at 5225 south laramie.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.263
      I secured a no-knock
        search warrant.

08:51.265 --> 08:53.698

   before you notify the feds

08:53.700 --> 08:54.966
       About that print.

08:54.968 --> 08:57.836
            - Yeah.

08:57.838 --> 09:01.540
        - They need you
     out on the perimeter.

09:01.542 --> 09:02.874
          - I'm okay.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.011
       - One more thing--

09:06.013 --> 09:10.048
    The second bomb was set
     to go off at 8:30 p.M.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.250
           The bomber
     screwed up somewhere.

09:14.754 --> 09:16.755
       - We're gonna ask
        for forgiveness

09:16.757 --> 09:20.659
  Instead of permission today,
        you understand?

09:20.661 --> 09:24.029
     We're not slowing down
         for anything.

09:24.031 --> 09:26.898
        I mean anything.

09:26.900 --> 09:31.136
   No one's gonna give a damn
once these bastards are caught.

09:34.340 --> 09:37.242
      All right, let's go.

09:42.782 --> 09:47.752
        You let us know
   if anything changes, okay?

09:47.754 --> 09:49.821
            - Okay.

09:49.823 --> 09:52.924

    any guarantees, though.

    Do you think we're gonna
   let you drive out of here?

 a throat, especially a cop's.

   Let's just talk this out,
           all right?

 You want to walk out of here,
   you can walk out of here.

   - Don't say another word!

      - This guy involved?
        - Looks like it.

17:06.159 --> 17:08.593
     - You can bring him in
 to any firehouse in the city.

17:08.595 --> 17:10.762
    We'll take five minutes,
           all right?

17:10.763 --> 17:12.396
    - We'll get some answers
      from him, I promise.

     To a community garden
      in his neighborhood.

17:32.318 --> 17:34.352
         - Well, we're
      onto something here.

17:34.354 --> 17:38.222
    - Yeah, I can't let you
traipse off with our only lead,

      Doing god knows what
         at all hours.

17:40.693 --> 17:42.760
  - All I need is 30 minutes.

17:48.200 --> 17:49.333
         - You got 20.

18:07.420 --> 18:10.354

18:10.356 --> 18:13.758
        - 18 people died
     in that bomb blast...

18:13.760 --> 18:18.096
     A dozen more clinging
   to their life upstairs...

     who's a niece of a cop

18:20.667 --> 18:23.768
        In my district.

18:23.770 --> 18:28.506
You tell me everything you know,
      every participant...

18:28.508 --> 18:31.476
      Because as a coward,
            vaughn--

18:31.478 --> 18:33.177
  And I know you're a coward,

18:33.179 --> 18:37.248
  'cause that's who lays bombs
    at cancer fund-raisers--

18:37.250 --> 18:39.117
  You will not endure the pain

18:39.119 --> 18:41.319
         That I'm going
      to put you through.

18:41.321 --> 18:44.489
      - I need to see a--
              aah!

18:45.757 --> 18:49.193
     - Now, let me tell you
          what I need.

18:49.195 --> 18:52.663
 I need to know about 8:30 p.M.

18:55.334 --> 18:59.237
- Once I get medical treatment.

18:59.239 --> 19:01.806
          [screaming]

19:05.377 --> 19:07.745
  - Vaughn said him and watts
      were both hooked up

19:07.747 --> 19:09.447
  With a guy named ted powell.

19:09.449 --> 19:10.882
         - Ted powell--
       I know that name.

19:10.884 --> 19:12.717
         He was big in
   the antigovernment fringe.

19:12.719 --> 19:13.718
        So was his dad.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.319
  - Why did watts get killed?

19:15.321 --> 19:17.355
       - Vaughn and watts
      were both in charge

19:17.357 --> 19:19.457
         Of setting off
    two separate car bombs.

19:19.459 --> 19:21.792
        Both bombs were
  supposed to go off tonight--

19:21.794 --> 19:24.262
         Watts at 8:00,
        vaughn at 8:30.

19:24.264 --> 19:26.497
Watts must've rigged his wrong,
'cause it went off this morning.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.499
          - 8:00 p.M.
     Was gonna be the gala

19:28.501 --> 19:30.401
         For the c.P.D.
  And the c.F.D. Brass, right?

19:30.403 --> 19:33.371
      - First bomb was set
          to get them.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.573
      Second bomb was set
  to get the first responders.

19:35.575 --> 19:37.275
- What else you get out of him?

19:37.277 --> 19:39.911
   - Vaughn said that powell
      had some master plan

19:39.913 --> 19:41.379
 That he didn't share with him.

19:41.381 --> 19:43.247
 So this wasn't the end of it.

19:43.249 --> 19:44.916
        - Here's powell.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.623
      - I saw him outside
  the hospital with the crowd.

19:52.625 --> 19:54.525
        He was here too.

19:54.527 --> 19:57.528
           All right,
    let's check out his dad.

20:01.266 --> 20:02.833
            - Casey!
             - Hey.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.936
         - How's gabby?
         - She's fine.

20:04.938 --> 20:09.373
  She's home--a little rattled
 still, but who can blame her?

20:09.375 --> 20:11.409
            - Here.
       - Oh, thanks, man.

20:11.411 --> 20:14.378
 - Thanks for getting her out.
             - Mm.

20:14.380 --> 20:17.982
           I told her
     she owes me a 12-pack.

20:17.984 --> 20:20.384
      - Any more survivors
  pulled out from the rubble?

20:20.386 --> 20:21.352
      - Doesn't look good.

20:21.354 --> 20:22.520
     We saw a woman's hand,

20:22.522 --> 20:24.655
      Spent the last hour
        digging her out.

20:24.657 --> 20:27.625
    It was a single mom from
 accounting--two kids at home.

20:29.328 --> 20:31.329
          Who would do
      something like this?

20:31.331 --> 20:35.967
 - I've got a pretty good idea.

20:35.969 --> 20:39.270
 - Ten years ago, frank powell,
   many of you will remember,

20:39.272 --> 20:42.240
       Was arrested after
a two-day standoff at his ranch

20:42.242 --> 20:43.941
      Outside of kankakee.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.509
         His wife died
       in the gun battle.

20:45.511 --> 20:47.345
     - The old man is doing
      life at stateville.

20:47.347 --> 20:49.880
      Two of my detectives
 are en route to interview him.

20:49.882 --> 20:51.649
     - Ted powell was there
   when the ranch was raided.

20:51.651 --> 20:54.685
       He lost his mother
    and his father that day.

20:54.687 --> 20:56.387
     He has been a fixture

20:56.389 --> 20:57.989
   On radical antigovernment
      websites ever since.

21:02.394 --> 21:04.428
       - Powell--correct.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.864
            - Okay.
         How far back?

21:06.866 --> 21:08.799
     - Far back as they go.
          Five years?

21:08.801 --> 21:10.468
            - Okay.

21:10.470 --> 21:12.303
      I'm gonna just need
   my supervisor to approve.

21:12.305 --> 21:15.973
    - Have you been watching
      the news today, man?

21:15.975 --> 21:18.709
     Do I need to run down
      a list of the dead?

21:18.711 --> 21:20.378
        [mouse clicking]

21:20.380 --> 21:21.912
           Thank you.

21:31.356 --> 21:33.691
- You're aware of what happened
     at chicago med today?

21:33.693 --> 21:35.426
            - I am.

21:35.428 --> 21:38.763
  - Your son ted was involved,
    possibly the mastermind,

21:38.765 --> 21:39.864
  But you probably knew that.

21:39.866 --> 21:42.867
        - So you allege.

21:42.869 --> 21:44.769
   - Look, whatever problems
you've had with the government,

21:44.771 --> 21:47.305
        Whatever losses
        you've suffered,

21:47.307 --> 21:51.709
    There's no way to excuse
    what your son did today.

21:51.711 --> 21:53.411
 Now, we have reason to believe

21:53.413 --> 21:56.947
    That there might be more
   to his plan, another step.

21:56.949 --> 21:59.917
       So we can work out
         a deal, okay?

21:59.919 --> 22:01.719
     It's a buyer's market
           right now.

22:01.721 --> 22:04.889
          You help us,
      and we'll help you.

22:04.891 --> 22:07.692
        - I couldn't be
       more proud of him.

22:07.694 --> 22:09.760
          - You know,
     children were killed.

22:09.762 --> 22:12.596
       - I got to explain
   collateral damage to you?

22:12.598 --> 22:14.532
        We're in a war.

22:14.534 --> 22:18.469
And in a war, there are gonna be
    noncombatant casualties.

22:21.039 --> 22:22.940
            - Okay.

22:25.877 --> 22:27.545
       What do you want?

22:27.547 --> 22:30.815
       There's got to be
      something you want.

22:30.817 --> 22:34.385
   - You know when the police
department started to go south?

22:35.821 --> 22:38.456
       When they started
     letting minorities in.

22:38.458 --> 22:41.492
          - Yes or no?
    You want to make a deal?

22:41.494 --> 22:43.894
     - 'cause before, see,
 when all the cops were white,

22:43.896 --> 22:46.030
     You could talk to them
     like a normal person.

22:46.032 --> 22:48.366
          But you get
      a minority in there,

22:48.368 --> 22:51.602
And there's all this resentment

22:51.604 --> 22:56.040
        From historical
   and personal shortcomings

22:56.042 --> 22:57.708
    That comes to the fore.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.877
     Now's their big chance

22:59.879 --> 23:03.414
          To get back
      at their oppressors.

23:11.957 --> 23:15.025
     - You mean like this?

24:05.177 --> 24:06.544
         - I don't care
      what you have to do.

24:06.546 --> 24:09.914
        No, you give me
         an exact time.

24:09.916 --> 24:12.783
         I need it now.
          - Halstead.

24:12.785 --> 24:14.218
            - Yeah.
            Hold on.

24:14.220 --> 24:16.620
      - I think everyone's
    gonna want to see this.

24:16.622 --> 24:20.925
   - Okay, okay, settle down.
      Settle down. Hit it.

24:20.927 --> 24:22.226
 - Ted powell just posted this

24:22.228 --> 24:25.796
          On a fringe
    antigovernment website.

24:27.499 --> 24:31.469
  - In 2004, my family's home
    in kankakee, illinois--

24:31.471 --> 24:33.904
     We came under attack,
     without justification,

24:33.906 --> 24:36.106
         By the chicago
       police department.

24:36.108 --> 24:39.977
We were fired upon, and our home
    was engulfed in flames.

24:39.979 --> 24:44.482
  The chicago fire department
   stood by and did nothing.

24:44.484 --> 24:48.118
    My mother died that day,
 and my father sits in prison.

24:48.120 --> 24:52.723
    I have waited ten years
   for the c.P.D. And c.F.D.

24:52.725 --> 24:55.693
To admit wrongdoing and to drop
 all charges against my father.

24:55.695 --> 24:57.962
     I will wait no longer.

24:57.964 --> 25:01.232
      I'm declaring war on
 the chicago police department

25:01.234 --> 25:02.967
  And chicago fire department.

25:02.969 --> 25:06.504
 If you are a member of either
 department, you are not safe.

25:06.506 --> 25:08.939
   If you are a family member
of someone in either department,

25:08.941 --> 25:12.510
       You are not safe.

25:12.512 --> 25:14.812
  This is just the beginning.

25:14.814 --> 25:16.113
      You've been warned.

25:21.620 --> 25:21.852
               .

25:21.854 --> 25:23.988
        - Yep, I got it.
      I'll call you back.

25:23.990 --> 25:25.823
     A ryan wilcox visited
     powell's dad in prison

25:25.825 --> 25:27.191
          Three times
    in the last six months.

25:27.193 --> 25:28.626
  Lindsay did a workup on him.

25:28.628 --> 25:29.860
    He's loosely affiliated

25:29.862 --> 25:31.862
          With various
    antigovernment groups--

25:31.864 --> 25:33.197
     Explosives background
   from a stint in the army.

25:33.199 --> 25:34.198
       Jin, she was gonna
     to send you something.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.599
       - Yeah, I got it.

25:35.601 --> 25:37.902
      Wilcox owns a garage
     in an industrial area

25:37.904 --> 25:39.603
        Where 96th meets
       the calumet river.

25:39.605 --> 25:41.839
 - All right, have antonio and
 lindsay meet us at the garage.

25:41.841 --> 25:43.741
         You stay here.
     Feed us what we need.

25:43.743 --> 25:45.809
  And keep graff in the loop.

25:45.811 --> 25:47.978
       - So you're saying
          zero chance?

25:52.884 --> 25:54.952
             - Yes.

25:54.954 --> 25:57.054
        Yes, mr. Thelan,
   that's what we're saying--

25:57.056 --> 25:58.055
             Zero.

25:58.057 --> 26:00.224
           - [sighs]

26:00.226 --> 26:02.927
    - But there's something
           you can do

26:02.929 --> 26:07.298
  That couldn't have been done
       even 30 years ago.

26:07.300 --> 26:09.934
   Your daughter's blood type
        is "o" negative.

26:09.936 --> 26:12.836
That's a match for another girl
 that got hit by the same blast

26:12.838 --> 26:15.940
     With a ruptured liver,
      right down the hall.

26:17.876 --> 26:20.311
       She's going to die
 if she doesn't get a new one.

26:20.313 --> 26:23.213
   That'll be two 9-year-olds

26:23.215 --> 26:25.316
          Killed by...

26:25.318 --> 26:27.184
      Something like this.

26:28.820 --> 26:31.855
  Under normal circumstances,
    you'd have time to work

26:31.857 --> 26:34.992
    With the state to donate
    your daughter's organs.

26:34.994 --> 26:38.062
            Today...

26:38.064 --> 26:42.333
         I'm asking you
  to make a targeted donation.

26:42.335 --> 26:45.269
        If you agree...

26:45.271 --> 26:49.139
     Your daughter's death
     won't be meaningless.

26:49.141 --> 26:51.742
            That...

26:53.845 --> 26:57.748
    That I know to be true.

27:04.823 --> 27:07.091
   - It's your decision, dad.

27:10.829 --> 27:14.031
      But if it were me...

27:14.033 --> 27:15.299
       Let's let her go.

27:15.301 --> 27:19.003

27:23.708 --> 27:27.411
 - We need to know in minutes,
           not hours.

27:44.362 --> 27:47.665
          - Doctor...

27:47.667 --> 27:49.933

        - Is that people
       talking in there?

        - A radio's on.

28:20.865 --> 28:23.333
        - It's positive
      for barium nitrate.

28:23.335 --> 28:24.902
     - Let's try the roof.

28:24.904 --> 28:27.838

     grab the fiber-optic.

      if the plaster falls

28:34.947 --> 28:39.316
 - You'll be the first to know.

28:39.318 --> 28:40.918
          - All right.
        - Do your thing.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.986

       So is the roll-up.

   Wires and 50-gallon drums
       attached to each.

28:59.772 --> 29:02.940
        Short version--
         do not breach.

29:02.942 --> 29:05.042
    - We could rappel down.

29:07.812 --> 29:10.414
   - All right, we don't need
    the whole team going in.

29:10.416 --> 29:11.949
         - I'll do it.

29:11.951 --> 29:13.884
     I just took the class
        in the academy.

29:13.886 --> 29:16.787
            Aced it.

29:16.789 --> 29:17.955
             Okay.

29:17.957 --> 29:19.890
          - All right,
       well, I need two.

29:19.892 --> 29:21.458
        Any volunteers?

29:21.460 --> 29:23.127
              You.

29:23.129 --> 29:25.028
  - Don't turn on any lights.

29:25.030 --> 29:26.797
            - Yeah.
            - Yeah.

         Let's do this.

 [indistinct chatter on radio]

29:39.979 --> 29:43.046
      [chatter continues]

29:49.954 --> 29:52.256
    - Ryan wilcox is here...

29:52.258 --> 29:53.991
    Multiple gunshot wounds.

29:53.993 --> 29:56.493
   - How long's he been dead?

29:56.495 --> 29:59.296
        - I'd say a day?
             - Max.

29:59.298 --> 30:02.099
     - It's powell tying up
        more loose ends.

30:02.101 --> 30:04.101
       - They left a lot
        of stuff behind.

30:04.103 --> 30:05.435
      - They never thought
         it'd be found.

30:05.437 --> 30:08.872
 They figured this whole block
       would be a crater.

30:10.441 --> 30:15.179
- Wilcox purchased a white cargo
   van about two months ago.

30:19.117 --> 30:21.084
       - There were three
   timing devices purchased.

30:21.086 --> 30:24.154
      I'm not a pessimist,
             but...

30:24.156 --> 30:25.889
    There's a damn good shot

30:25.891 --> 30:27.891
 That there's a third car bomb
out there in a white cargo van.

30:27.893 --> 30:30.994
    - If the second bomb was
supposed to go off at 8:30 p.M.,

30:30.996 --> 30:33.897
  Maybe the third bomb was set
to go off at that time as well.

30:33.899 --> 30:36.333
     - What time is it now?
            - 7:55.

         I'm listening,
     but I don't hear dick.

30:45.377 --> 30:48.512
    - Blowing up a district
      would be too risky.

30:48.514 --> 30:50.347
  A bomb would be sniffed out
          in seconds.

30:50.349 --> 30:52.482
         - A firehouse?
     - Not enough victims.

30:52.484 --> 30:55.252
  - Powell wanted high-ranking
 police and firefighters dead.

30:55.254 --> 30:56.954
      Most of them planned
   on attending the 10k gala.

30:56.956 --> 30:59.189
       - Yeah, and where
   would the rest be tonight?

30:59.191 --> 31:00.190
        - Headquarters.

31:00.192 --> 31:03.160
         - Bull's-eye.

31:57.116 --> 31:59.283
  Jin, text everyone the photo

31:59.285 --> 32:00.984
        And plate number
     of the van purchased.

32:00.986 --> 32:03.387
        - You're looking
     for a white econoline.

32:03.389 --> 32:04.621
      Bomb squad en route.

32:04.623 --> 32:07.624
- We should have made that left.

32:07.626 --> 32:12.162
      - Halstead, lindsay,
   those back roads pay off?

32:12.164 --> 32:14.231
  - Yeah, but traffic patterns
       are all screwed up

32:14.233 --> 32:16.566
    Because of the bombing.
       - 15 minutes out.

32:18.469 --> 32:21.939
        - Alvin, please,
    give me some good news.

32:25.610 --> 32:27.611
             Alvin?

32:27.613 --> 32:29.446
       - Pulling up now.

32:29.448 --> 32:33.517
   - Any eyes on the vehicle?
           - Not yet.

32:40.124 --> 32:43.593
- We're sure this van is white?

33:07.085 --> 33:08.719
       - Vehicle located,
      south side entrance.

33:08.721 --> 33:11.088
     It's blue, not white--
            no tags.

33:11.090 --> 33:15.025
         - 12 minutes.
   - Jin, bomb squad update.

33:15.027 --> 33:16.426
      - Three blocks away.

33:16.428 --> 33:18.061
        - Hey, if powell
      was at the hospital

33:18.063 --> 33:19.463
        Because he likes
   to watch his handiwork...

33:19.465 --> 33:21.465
         - What's that?

33:21.467 --> 33:23.433
         - Right there.
           - Up top?

33:23.435 --> 33:26.503
   - Yeah, right there. See?
      - Hey, on the roof.

33:26.505 --> 33:30.140
       - What do we got?
         - On the roof!

33:35.480 --> 33:36.680
        [tires screech]

33:48.259 --> 33:51.361
           - Freeze!
           - Drop it!

33:51.363 --> 33:53.230
           - Get out!
    Get out of the building!

33:53.232 --> 33:54.564
              Now!
         - Go! Go! Go!

33:57.435 --> 33:59.536
            Stairs.

34:04.642 --> 34:07.544
        - He's going up.

34:15.286 --> 34:17.420
       - There's voight.
            Come on.

34:21.460 --> 34:24.561
      - We think powell is
   on the apartment building!

34:24.563 --> 34:26.396
          In pursuit!

34:26.398 --> 34:30.167
   - There's the bomb squad!
    You stay with the bomb!

34:32.235 --> 34:35.539
             - Hey!

34:35.541 --> 34:37.440
       - Officer sumner,
          district 21.

34:37.443 --> 34:40.409
  Explosive is inside the van,
set to go off in 8 1/2 minutes.

34:40.411 --> 34:41.678
          - All right,
    clear the area, please.

34:41.679 --> 34:45.514
    - Get back! Back! Move!

34:58.663 --> 35:00.564
   - Suspect's entered roof!

35:17.615 --> 35:17.848
               .

35:17.850 --> 35:19.749
      - Drop your weapon!

35:19.751 --> 35:21.718
           Cover me.

35:33.464 --> 35:36.633
        - You can't win!
       Drop your weapon!

35:36.635 --> 35:38.168
          Put it down!

35:38.170 --> 35:40.837
      - I want him alive!

35:40.839 --> 35:42.606
             - Aah!

35:45.644 --> 35:49.179
    - How many of your boys
  did I put in the dirt today?

35:49.181 --> 35:51.915
    Any of 'em good friends?

35:51.917 --> 35:55.619
       - You wanna watch?
         - [screaming]

35:55.621 --> 35:57.187
          - Watch it.
         - No! No, no!

35:57.189 --> 35:58.288
         - Time check!

35:58.290 --> 36:00.423
         - 60 seconds!

36:06.430 --> 36:08.298
        [radio beeping]
       - bomb dismantled.

36:08.300 --> 36:10.901
            Repeat--
        bomb dismantled.

36:10.903 --> 36:12.302
             - Aah!

36:12.304 --> 36:13.870
         - Plan failed.

36:13.872 --> 36:18.175
      - Actually, I think
   it was a pretty good day.

36:22.313 --> 36:24.748
            [coughs]

36:24.750 --> 36:27.384
            [grunts]

36:27.386 --> 36:32.956
              Aah!
      [handcuffs clicking]

36:36.394 --> 36:37.627
  - That's good work tonight.

36:37.629 --> 36:39.496
      [indistinct chatter
       over police radio]

36:50.508 --> 36:52.542
           - Voight.

36:52.544 --> 36:54.511
    Good working with you...

36:54.513 --> 36:56.813
   Or, uh, watching you work,
         I should say.

36:56.815 --> 36:58.815
        - You too, sir.

37:03.821 --> 37:05.989
              Hey.

37:05.991 --> 37:07.857
         You all right?

37:07.859 --> 37:09.726
            - Solid.

37:09.728 --> 37:11.261
          - Tough guy.

37:15.967 --> 37:18.702
           - Suction.

37:18.704 --> 37:20.570
    [heart monitor beeping]
     as a senior resident,

37:20.572 --> 37:22.973
         I was on call.

37:22.975 --> 37:26.910
       I was working with
   the chief trauma surgeon.

37:26.912 --> 37:28.578
I knew he'd be the one deciding

37:28.580 --> 37:32.682
      If I got the coveted
  trauma fellowship position.

37:32.684 --> 37:35.919
  About 9:00 p.M., we were up
to our eyeballs in trauma cases,

37:35.921 --> 37:39.789
  And I got a call that my dad
    suffered a heart attack.

37:39.791 --> 37:41.691
           Was rushed
      to another hospital.

37:41.693 --> 37:45.462
             Clamp.

37:45.464 --> 37:47.831
    I asked if I could leave
     to be with my father.

37:47.833 --> 37:49.266
    He looked me in the eye
           and said,

37:49.268 --> 37:50.533
       "yeah, you can go,

37:50.535 --> 37:53.837
        But you'll never
  get the trauma fellowship."

37:53.839 --> 37:56.640
       I couldn't believe
 how insensitive this guy was.

37:56.642 --> 37:59.542
       - Heart rate 150.
     Pressure is dropping.

37:59.544 --> 38:02.545
      - We saved 16 people
          that night,

38:02.547 --> 38:05.448
    But my dad passed away.

38:05.450 --> 38:07.517
      Heparinized saline.

38:10.488 --> 38:12.422
    Removing proximal clamp.

38:12.424 --> 38:14.891
         - 80 systolic.

38:14.893 --> 38:17.861
            76, 70.
[heart monitor beeping rapidly]

38:17.863 --> 38:23.366
       When I understand
   why that surgeon did that.

38:23.368 --> 38:25.402
 This is the life we've chosen.

38:25.404 --> 38:28.638
       And what we can do
     is right here and now.

38:28.640 --> 38:29.873
 It's the most important thing.

38:29.875 --> 38:31.808
[heart monitor beeping steadily]

38:31.810 --> 38:34.944
  And that is to try and save
       this little girl.

38:45.456 --> 38:48.024
          [door opens]

39:16.354 --> 39:19.456
      - The operation went
 as well as could be expected.

39:20.624 --> 39:23.993
  There's, uh, good blood flow
         to the liver,

39:23.995 --> 39:25.962
     And the other bleeding
          has stopped.

39:29.900 --> 39:31.468
     She's got a long road
         ahead of her,

39:31.470 --> 39:33.570
  But, uh, it's looking good.

39:36.006 --> 39:39.075
          - [sobbing]

39:45.082 --> 39:47.083
           - [sighs]

39:49.920 --> 39:51.888
  - Where the fire department
     is still working hard

39:51.890 --> 39:54.023
      To clean up the mess
         left by a bomb

39:54.025 --> 39:56.059
   That went off at 8 o'clock
         this morning,

39:56.061 --> 39:59.863
      - How many survivors
         they pull out?

39:59.865 --> 40:01.931
 - I just heard over two dozen.

40:03.968 --> 40:07.003
           - Thanks.

40:07.005 --> 40:10.407
  - Chicago will bounce back.

40:10.409 --> 40:11.908
            - Yeah.

40:11.910 --> 40:14.844
       - She always does.

40:16.714 --> 40:18.815
     - We'll give you more
   information as we get it.

40:18.817 --> 40:21.484
    We're here--we're gonna
      be here all night...

40:26.791 --> 40:28.858
           - [sighs]

40:36.834 --> 40:39.769
        [knock at door]

40:47.011 --> 40:49.679
             - Hey.
             - Hey.

40:55.820 --> 40:58.955
     I should have called.
            I know.

41:00.991 --> 41:03.560
 - You don't ever have to call.

41:49.039 --> 41:51.241
    I just have one request.

41:51.243 --> 41:54.944
            - Yeah?
            Name it.

41:56.213 --> 41:58.815
       - Stay the night.

41:58.817 --> 42:03.152
       After today, I...
   - I'm not going anywhere.
