-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:28.195 --> 00:30.262
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:30.264 --> 00:32.631
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:32.633 --> 00:33.999
in a court of law.

00:36.604 --> 00:40.172
-Been in law enforcement
for about 23 years now.

00:40.174 --> 00:42.174
It's something I've always
focused my career on

00:42.176 --> 00:44.877
was combating narcotics.

00:44.879 --> 00:47.646
We're starting to get
overwhelmed with heroin

00:47.648 --> 00:51.550
so every chance I get to
try to combat that
or try to help someone out

00:51.552 --> 00:55.120
in that area, through
working narcotics from the years

00:55.122 --> 00:57.489
I've got all the contacts
in there where
I can get people help

00:57.491 --> 00:59.758
so I don't just
put everyone in jail.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.728
I'm gonna try to catch up
with this truck.

01:02.730 --> 01:06.098
Both driver and passenger,
neither one had a seatbelt on.

01:06.834 --> 01:09.568
This area is known for
a lot of narcotics.

01:10.438 --> 01:13.205
(radio chatter)

01:15.810 --> 01:18.610
Big maroon Nissan truck,
two times.

01:24.051 --> 01:25.551
How you doing?

01:25.553 --> 01:27.252
You didn't have your
seat belt on when you passed me
back there.

01:27.254 --> 01:29.288
-I know, man, I'm sorry.
-Where are you guys
headed to tonight?

01:29.290 --> 01:30.656
-I'm taking her to her house.

01:30.658 --> 01:32.057
-You have warrants
on you or anything?

01:32.059 --> 01:33.559
-Uh, no.

01:33.561 --> 01:34.393
-First name?

01:34.395 --> 01:36.028
-Savannah.
-Savannah.

01:36.030 --> 01:36.862
-What are you reaching for?

01:36.864 --> 01:38.397
You got an ID?

01:38.399 --> 01:41.366
-I'm checking to make sure
if I have it or not.

01:42.703 --> 01:44.303
No, I'm afraid I don't have it.

01:47.308 --> 01:49.908
-I am so sorry, sir, that I
did not have my seat belt on.

01:49.910 --> 01:51.810
-Why don't you step out of
the vehicle, come back here

01:51.812 --> 01:53.045
and talk to me real quick.

01:54.648 --> 01:56.148
Step back here.

01:56.150 --> 01:58.884
-I'm sorry.
-You got anything in the
vehicle I need to know about?

01:58.886 --> 02:00.052
-No, sir.

02:00.054 --> 02:01.687
-Who is she to you?

02:01.689 --> 02:04.857
-She's a friend that I've know
for probably 10 or 15 years.

02:04.859 --> 02:08.227
She actually pierced my eyebrow
when I was about 20 years old

02:08.229 --> 02:10.929
and she's a friend that--
all right, go ahead.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.298
-Stay in the vehicle, ma'am.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.501
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-Go ahead and shut the door
and stay in the vehicle.

02:15.503 --> 02:16.969
-I just opened the door
'cause it's hot.

02:16.971 --> 02:19.271
-Well, shut the door, right now
while I'm dealing with this.

02:19.273 --> 02:20.706
You got anything illegal on you?

02:20.708 --> 02:21.573
-Uh, no, sir.

02:21.575 --> 02:22.374
-Nothing at all?

02:22.376 --> 02:23.842
-Uh-hmm.

02:23.844 --> 02:25.410
-All right, where
y'all coming from?

02:25.412 --> 02:26.845
-Up here at my friend's house.

02:26.847 --> 02:28.180
-Who's your friend?

02:28.182 --> 02:30.582
-Uh, he lives over the hill,
I wanted to see if my bicycle

02:30.584 --> 02:31.483
was there.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.651
-You had anything
to drink today?

02:32.653 --> 02:35.454
-Uh, yeah, I've
been drinking today.
-A lot?

02:35.456 --> 02:37.456
Okay, you got anything
in your purse, anything illegal?

02:37.458 --> 02:38.390
-No, sir.

02:38.392 --> 02:39.691
-Be honest with me, okay?

02:39.693 --> 02:42.161
If you got anything at all,
right now is the time if you

02:42.163 --> 02:43.228
want any leniency here,
all right?

02:43.230 --> 02:45.063
-No, sir, I do not.
-Okay.

02:45.065 --> 02:47.466
Just stay out of
your purse, all right?

02:47.468 --> 02:49.568
Come back here
and talk to me, Jeremy.

02:49.570 --> 02:50.802
-What's up?

02:50.804 --> 02:52.638
-All right, what were
y'all doing up here?
-Um...

02:54.475 --> 02:55.674
-Honestly.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.376
-She just told me
to give her a ride.

02:57.378 --> 02:58.644
-She wanting drugs or anything?

02:58.646 --> 03:00.012
-I don't know, she didn't say.

03:00.014 --> 03:04.917
I have a job that I work
six days a week and I'm not

03:04.919 --> 03:07.286
wanting to sacrifice that.

03:07.288 --> 03:10.122
I'm a United Steel Workers,
I work at JBS--

03:10.124 --> 03:11.056
-Hold on.

03:12.359 --> 03:13.725
60, I got one running.

03:18.199 --> 03:21.333
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground!

03:21.335 --> 03:22.634
Get on the ground, now.

03:24.605 --> 03:26.505
Get on the ground, lay out.

03:26.507 --> 03:28.040
Put your hand behind your back.

03:29.043 --> 03:30.075
-What did I do?

03:30.077 --> 03:32.744
-You ran from me
and I told you to stop.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.846
-I didn't hear you say stop.

03:36.817 --> 03:37.816
What you gonna do?

03:39.386 --> 03:41.220
-Give me the other hand.

03:42.256 --> 03:45.023
(radio chatter)

03:48.862 --> 03:51.930
-Now how is my fat ass
supposed to get up from here?
-One in custody.

03:51.932 --> 03:54.132
-Dispatch:
Zero-one in custody,
20-0-5.

03:54.134 --> 03:55.500
-Now sit up.

03:55.502 --> 03:56.435
Stand up.

03:58.739 --> 04:01.006
Now you just made things
worse for you, okay?

04:01.008 --> 04:02.474
-Well I was scared.

04:04.778 --> 04:07.479
I didn't know, he just gave
me a ride up the street.

04:08.315 --> 04:09.448
-And you ran for
no reason, huh?

04:09.450 --> 04:12.217
-I'm just scared of the police.

04:12.219 --> 04:13.485
I haven't done anything wrong.

04:13.487 --> 04:15.387
-'Cause you may have
a warrant on you, is that it?

04:15.389 --> 04:16.321
-Do I have one?

04:17.524 --> 04:18.457
Huh?

04:19.493 --> 04:20.459
-Checking on it.

04:21.495 --> 04:22.961
When you ran from the scene,
I tell you to stop,

04:22.963 --> 04:24.396
you keep on running.

04:24.398 --> 04:26.732
-I never heard you
say stop one time.

04:26.734 --> 04:30.135
-Well you shouldn't have been
running, you woulda heard it.

04:30.137 --> 04:31.703
-I was scared.

04:31.705 --> 04:35.173
(radio chatter)

04:35.175 --> 04:37.276
-Stay right here.
-So now what
am I going to jail for?

04:37.278 --> 04:38.844
-Stay right there.

04:38.846 --> 04:40.279
Right now, resisting arrest.

04:41.115 --> 04:42.047
Evading.

04:43.384 --> 04:44.516
-Well what did I do?

04:45.452 --> 04:47.052
-You ran from me,
that's what you did.

04:47.054 --> 04:47.853
You know what you did.

04:47.855 --> 04:49.187
-Because I was afraid.

04:50.491 --> 04:51.590
-Why?

04:51.592 --> 04:53.492
-Because I don't know
what he's got on him.

04:53.494 --> 04:56.128
He just gave me a ride.
-'Cause you got a warrant
on you, that's why you ran.

04:56.130 --> 04:57.763
-He's a friend
of mine's brother.

04:57.765 --> 04:58.730
Do I have one?

04:58.732 --> 04:59.598
-You do.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.533
You stay right there.

05:02.603 --> 05:04.636
-Bye. Have a nice day.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.371
-Sit down, sit down.
-He told me--

05:06.373 --> 05:08.106
I can't sit down.
-Yes, you can.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.509
I'm gonna help you,
now sit down.

05:10.511 --> 05:11.443
See.

05:13.580 --> 05:15.447
Don't make-- make any worse.

05:16.917 --> 05:17.749
Okay.

05:17.751 --> 05:18.684
-Like how?

05:20.421 --> 05:22.487
-I'm gonna let him
get outta here.

05:22.489 --> 05:23.822
Jeremy?
-Yes, sir.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.390
-When you're out here driving
around, okay, you make sure

05:25.392 --> 05:26.858
you got your seat belt on.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.760
-I'm sorry.
-You see what all happened
just because of a minor

05:28.762 --> 05:30.395
infraction as a seat belt, okay?

05:30.397 --> 05:32.964
-I'm a safety rep at
my work, I'm sorry.

05:32.966 --> 05:35.300
I couldn't even believe that,
you know, I mean, like, for me

05:35.302 --> 05:38.970
as a safety rep, I should
have my safety belt on.

05:38.972 --> 05:40.172
-Exactly right.

05:40.174 --> 05:42.040
I would be more particular
who you have in your car,

05:42.042 --> 05:44.443
'cause this could have caused
you a lot of problems, okay?

05:44.445 --> 05:46.445
She's got a purse in there but
there's not anything in there

05:46.447 --> 05:47.813
you just need to
hang onto it until--

05:47.815 --> 05:49.014
-Take it to my (bleep) mom.

05:49.016 --> 05:51.283
-I'll take it to
your mom right now.

05:51.285 --> 05:52.317
-All right.

05:52.319 --> 05:54.186
So what'd I say?

05:54.188 --> 05:55.020
-Thank you.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.621
-No, what'd I say?

05:56.623 --> 05:58.423
-Be careful of who
I put in my truck.

05:58.425 --> 06:00.092
-Seat belts.
-Seat belts.

06:00.094 --> 06:01.226
-I'm giving you
a break today, okay?

06:01.228 --> 06:02.060
-I appreciate it, sir.

06:02.062 --> 06:03.362
-Alright.

06:03.364 --> 06:04.363
If I stop you again, there
won't be no more breaks okay?

06:04.365 --> 06:05.630
-I understand, I'm sorry.

06:05.632 --> 06:07.866
-All right, get on outta here.

06:07.868 --> 06:10.702
If you quit moving, these cuffs
wouldn't be a problem.

06:10.704 --> 06:11.570
-Yeah, yeah.

06:11.572 --> 06:12.771
I don't give a (bleep).

06:13.707 --> 06:15.006
-You need to calm down.

06:16.410 --> 06:17.943
She's trying to hit
her head on the--

06:17.945 --> 06:18.777
-Stop it.

06:18.779 --> 06:19.811
Savannah.

06:19.813 --> 06:20.645
-Stop it.

06:20.647 --> 06:21.480
-What are you gonna do?

06:21.482 --> 06:23.148
-Do want us to tie your legs?

06:23.150 --> 06:24.116
And hog tie you?

06:24.118 --> 06:25.584
-That has nothing
to do with my head.

06:25.586 --> 06:28.286
And you can't drive me
like that, Sarge.

06:28.288 --> 06:30.322
So, turn me loose.

06:30.324 --> 06:31.857
-You need to calm down.

06:31.859 --> 06:34.493
-You go ahead
and call 601 (inaudible)
and tell them you're bringing

06:34.495 --> 06:37.596
in Savannah and they'll send
out the (bleep) goon squad

06:37.598 --> 06:39.564
so let me go.
-You need to chill out, okay?

06:39.566 --> 06:41.099
Keep on doing this,
then we're gonna put more

06:41.101 --> 06:42.434
charges on you.

06:42.436 --> 06:44.302
You need to calm down.
We're giving you
an opportunity to.

06:44.304 --> 06:46.571
-You're not giving me
an opportunity to do anything.

06:46.573 --> 06:47.739
-What'd I just tell you?

06:47.741 --> 06:49.975
-Would you go ahead
and take me down there?

06:49.977 --> 06:50.909
-I'll take you down there.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.411
-Well let's go.
-All right.

06:53.547 --> 06:56.314
-You know, all she had was
a warrant for a driving charge,

06:56.316 --> 07:00.452
instead she chose more
jail time and more fines
and costs for her.

07:01.355 --> 07:03.221
-I've been hired with
the sheriff's office for

07:03.223 --> 07:04.823
approximately
two and a half years.

07:04.825 --> 07:08.894
My dad, he's been a police
officer for 27 plus years

07:08.896 --> 07:11.563
and just hearing his stories
on a day-to-day basis influenced

07:11.565 --> 07:12.597
me to go into it.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.065
(radio chatter)

07:14.067 --> 07:17.569
-All right, we're heading to
a retail petty theft call here,

07:17.571 --> 07:20.472
a local business is wanting to
report someone that just stole

07:20.474 --> 07:22.140
some merchandise.

07:22.142 --> 07:25.076
He was a white male wearing
a black shirt, black shorts

07:25.078 --> 07:26.578
and a backpack.

07:26.580 --> 07:28.947
So we're gonna circle
the area here and see if
we can't locate him.

07:41.228 --> 07:42.928
Three-three-seven,
we got one running.

07:42.930 --> 07:45.931
We're northbound on Pace.

07:53.106 --> 07:54.272
Let me see your hands!

07:54.274 --> 07:55.474
Get down on the ground!

07:55.476 --> 07:56.575
Down on the ground!

07:56.577 --> 07:58.343
-I didn't do nothing.
-Get on your stomach!

07:59.446 --> 08:01.046
337, 10, one detained.

08:01.048 --> 08:04.115
We're behind a little
business here by Mallory.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.353
Stand up.

08:10.123 --> 08:11.890
Walk this way.

08:14.361 --> 08:15.660
Let's go this way.

08:15.662 --> 08:16.995
Who was running with you?

08:17.731 --> 08:20.298
-Some black guy.
-Some black guy?

08:20.300 --> 08:22.667
-Yeah.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.736
-You cleared that
fence pretty good.

08:24.738 --> 08:26.271
Step over here.

08:28.375 --> 08:29.508
-Where's he at?

08:29.510 --> 08:31.176
-Who?
-The black dude?

08:31.178 --> 08:33.011
-I don't know.
I don't want the black dude.
I want you.

08:33.013 --> 08:33.879
-For what?

08:33.881 --> 08:35.380
-Why'd you run?

08:35.382 --> 08:37.749
-Why do you think?
You're the one running.

08:39.419 --> 08:40.352
Come on.

08:41.688 --> 08:44.990
Hey, can you just have
the employee from
Family Dollar come over

08:44.992 --> 08:46.057
and do a show up here.

08:46.059 --> 08:47.325
-Okay.

08:47.327 --> 08:48.894
-Stand right here by
the back of the car.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.495
Spread your legs.

08:50.497 --> 08:51.663
What's your name?

08:51.665 --> 08:53.331
-Steven.
-What's your address?

08:53.333 --> 08:55.500
-Uh, I'm homeless right now.

08:55.502 --> 08:58.503
-All right, stand right here
by the corner of the vehicle.

08:58.505 --> 09:00.138
Face that way.

09:00.140 --> 09:01.439
Right here.

09:01.441 --> 09:02.340
Face that way.

09:04.111 --> 09:05.610
-Officer On Radio:
Yeah, 10-four, that's him.

09:05.612 --> 09:06.545
-10-four.

09:07.481 --> 09:08.413
-What's wrong?

09:09.416 --> 09:11.850
-You're under arrest
for retail theft.

09:11.852 --> 09:13.919
-Hold on, the other guy is.
-Huh?

09:13.921 --> 09:15.020
-He's the one that
stole something.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.421
-Okay, get in the car.
-I didn't steal nothing.

09:16.423 --> 09:18.056
-Okay.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.624
-I didn't get away with nothing.

09:19.626 --> 09:20.959
-Okay.

09:23.630 --> 09:26.197
This is the backpack that we
found hanging on the fence

09:26.199 --> 09:27.699
when he stared running.

09:27.701 --> 09:31.069
We're investigating a retail
petty theft and this individual

09:31.071 --> 09:34.239
matches the description
of the suspect.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.642
And I'm guessing this formula
is gonna be the stolen

09:37.644 --> 09:38.944
merchandise.

09:40.147 --> 09:41.379
That's all that's in there?

09:41.381 --> 09:42.314
-That's it.

09:43.350 --> 09:44.883
-Here's his black shirt too.

09:47.788 --> 09:48.787
All right, thank you.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.656
You wish to speak with me at
all about what happened today?

09:51.658 --> 09:53.925
-Yes, sir.
-Okay, first of all,
why did you run?

09:53.927 --> 09:55.827
-Why'd I run?
-Yeah, when you saw me.

09:55.829 --> 09:58.096
I saw you when we're on
Pepaw and Marino,
I was coming

09:58.098 --> 10:00.165
around the corner,
you started running.

10:00.167 --> 10:01.333
Why'd you run?

10:01.335 --> 10:03.668
-Well the black dude said,
"Come on, come on, man."

10:03.670 --> 10:05.503
I'm like, damn, man.

10:05.505 --> 10:06.738
He the one that got me to run.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.173
He the one did
all the shoplifting.

10:08.175 --> 10:10.976
-Okay.
-And I know where he lives at.

10:10.978 --> 10:11.943
-Okay.
-I do.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.912
-What's his name?
-His name is Johnny.

10:13.914 --> 10:15.914
-Johnny who?
-I don't know his last name.

10:15.916 --> 10:17.582
-Okay.
Where's Johnny live at?

10:17.584 --> 10:18.783
-He lives on Gaston Street.

10:18.785 --> 10:19.918
-Gaston, okay.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.953
So what happened today?

10:21.955 --> 10:23.488
What happened over
at the Family Dollar?

10:23.490 --> 10:26.091
-Well, he went in there
and doing the stealing.

10:26.093 --> 10:27.859
-Okay.
-Okay, and, uh...

10:28.862 --> 10:30.862
I didn't go out of the store
with nothing.

10:30.864 --> 10:31.896
-You didn't go out
the store with nothing?

10:31.898 --> 10:33.064
-Nothing.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.466
-Okay, well, what about
your backpack up there?

10:34.468 --> 10:36.401
-Okay, I didn't get that
from Family Dollar.

10:36.403 --> 10:38.036
That didn't come from
nowhere around here.

10:38.038 --> 10:39.137
-Okay.
-Okay.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.406
-All right, so that
backpack is yours though?

10:41.408 --> 10:42.374
-That's my backpack.

10:42.376 --> 10:43.308
-And you were
wearing the backpack?

10:43.310 --> 10:44.542
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

10:44.544 --> 10:46.678
What was in the backpack?
-Some baby formula.

10:46.680 --> 10:48.046
-Okay, where'd
you get that from?

10:48.048 --> 10:49.848
-I got it from
somebody's house.

10:49.850 --> 10:50.849
-Whose house?

10:50.851 --> 10:52.884
-The person I was
staying with last night.

10:52.886 --> 10:53.985
-Who were you staying with?

10:53.987 --> 10:55.320
-I stayed with a dude
named Richard.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.688
-Richard?
What's Richard's last name?

10:56.690 --> 10:58.123
-I don't know his last name.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.924
-So you're just staying
with some random dude
named Richard?

10:59.926 --> 11:01.192
Okay.

11:01.194 --> 11:03.728
Right now I have an employee
that positively identified

11:03.730 --> 11:05.597
you as being the one
that was stealing.

11:05.599 --> 11:06.965
-Okay, no, the black dude
was stealing.

11:06.967 --> 11:09.467
-Okay, I understand the black
dude's probably stealing too

11:09.469 --> 11:13.471
but here, I have an employee
telling me that they saw you

11:13.473 --> 11:14.572
stealing.

11:14.574 --> 11:15.540
Okay?

11:15.542 --> 11:16.908
You're not telling me
the whole truth.

11:16.910 --> 11:20.879
It's gonna beneficial to you,
if you come clean with me.

11:20.881 --> 11:22.747
-Okay.
-And tell me exactly
what happened.

11:22.749 --> 11:24.949
-Okay.
-So it's gonna be best if you
just tell me the truth, okay?

11:24.951 --> 11:27.152
-I'm gonna tell you the truth.
-Tell me the truth,
beginning to end.

11:27.154 --> 11:28.720
-I went in there to
get some baby bibs.

11:28.722 --> 11:29.988
-Baby what?

11:29.990 --> 11:31.656
-Baby bibs.
-Okay.

11:31.658 --> 11:34.893
-I got two things and I put
them in my pocket and then--

11:34.895 --> 11:35.827
-Two what, baby bibs?

11:35.829 --> 11:37.696
-The baby bibs.

11:37.698 --> 11:38.730
-Okay.

11:38.732 --> 11:40.298
-And when the lady
at the door asked me,

11:40.300 --> 11:42.434
did I have anything,
she said come around here.

11:42.436 --> 11:45.003
I said here you go,
so I gave up everything I had

11:45.005 --> 11:46.504
and I took my pants down.

11:46.506 --> 11:48.339
-Okay.
-And showed her that I didn't
have nothing in my pockets.

11:48.341 --> 11:49.874
Then she asked me
about the black dude.

11:49.876 --> 11:53.411
I said, he went out the store,
he was stealing too.

11:53.413 --> 11:55.447
-Uh-hmm.
-And she knew that.

11:55.449 --> 11:56.881
I said please don't
call the police.

11:56.883 --> 11:58.817
Here, here's the stuff back,
please.

11:58.819 --> 12:02.320
-So why were you
stealing baby bibs?

12:02.322 --> 12:04.122
-'Cause I needed them.
-For what, a baby?

12:04.124 --> 12:05.390
-A friend of mine got a baby.

12:05.392 --> 12:06.491
-Oh, okay.

12:06.493 --> 12:07.992
-He's paying me a few
dollars to get them.

12:07.994 --> 12:09.060
-Okay, so he's paying you

12:09.062 --> 12:10.628
to go in there
and steal the bibs for him?

12:10.630 --> 12:12.964
Okay. But why are you
carrying baby formula?

12:12.966 --> 12:13.998
-Well I'm trying to sell it.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.633
Make me some money.

12:15.635 --> 12:17.736
-So did you steal it
from the buddy down there?

12:17.738 --> 12:18.903
-No.

12:18.905 --> 12:21.873
-So he said, here's the baby
formula for my kid,

12:21.875 --> 12:22.974
go sell it and make money.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.642
-No, I didn't say that.

12:24.644 --> 12:25.744
-That's what he said?

12:25.746 --> 12:27.412
-No.
-So how did you obtain this?

12:27.414 --> 12:28.346
Did he give it to you?

12:28.348 --> 12:29.481
-No, he didn't
give it to me, sir.

12:29.483 --> 12:31.649
-So you stole it?
-I didn't steal it.

12:31.651 --> 12:33.451
Wherever I was at last night,
that's where I got it from.

12:33.453 --> 12:34.819
-Okay.

12:34.821 --> 12:37.489
So you took it from there
without anybody
knowing about it?

12:38.258 --> 12:40.125
This is not jiving up
real well, okay?

12:40.127 --> 12:42.527
You want me to be
honest with you?

12:42.529 --> 12:44.195
I think you stole
that from somewhere.

12:44.197 --> 12:46.097
-Well, I didn't steal
that outta the store.

12:46.099 --> 12:49.334
-Okay. 'Cause you're the first
person I've ever met

12:49.336 --> 12:52.937
in my whole entire life that
is dealing in baby supplies.

12:52.939 --> 12:54.506
That's just a weird
profession to me.

12:54.508 --> 12:56.407
Is it a lucrative business?

12:56.409 --> 12:57.609
-No.

12:57.611 --> 12:59.511
-Well here, I'm gonna be
straight up with you, okay?

12:59.513 --> 13:01.479
You are being
placed under arrest.

13:01.481 --> 13:03.615
You are being charged
with retail petty theft

13:03.617 --> 13:05.650
and resisting
an officer without violence.

13:05.652 --> 13:07.485
Okay?
You ran from me,
that's the charge

13:07.487 --> 13:08.653
you're getting
for running from me.

13:08.655 --> 13:10.722
-They pressing charges?
-Yes, they are, yes, sir.

13:10.724 --> 13:12.223
-But I gave them back though.

13:12.225 --> 13:14.125
-I understand, but you
still concealed them
and under state statute,

13:14.127 --> 13:17.061
in the state of Florida,
that's all we need to
charge petty theft.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.331
-I think ride-alongs are great.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.834
It gives people a glimpse into
what our day-to-day is like.

13:22.836 --> 13:25.136
Sitting up front with us
and seeing what we see.

13:25.138 --> 13:28.106
I think it helps give
good perspective as to
the minute-to-minute

13:28.108 --> 13:30.441
decisions that we have to
make and how quickly some can

13:30.443 --> 13:31.776
go from good to bad.

13:31.778 --> 13:34.546
(radio chatter)

13:35.348 --> 13:38.016
-Boyfriend and girlfriend
are in a physical altercation.

13:38.018 --> 13:44.189
Apparently the female half
is now walking towards
the male half

13:44.191 --> 13:46.357
with a hammer.

13:49.229 --> 13:52.864
47, I have contact
with the complainant.

13:57.838 --> 13:59.771
Hello.
Did she do this to you?

13:59.773 --> 14:01.940
-Yeah.
-Okay, with what?

14:01.942 --> 14:05.844
-With her claws and she
bashed me with a freaking bat,

14:05.846 --> 14:08.146
and like, like I told her
20 times to leave.

14:08.148 --> 14:09.347
I'm like, Holly, I don't
wanna do this today.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.915
I don't wanna do this, like,
leave, just leave today.

14:10.917 --> 14:12.350
Just leave,
just leave, just leave.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.385
And she would not leave
and then she just starts
getting violent,

14:14.387 --> 14:17.856
she starts picking up hammers
and starts coming after me,
she throws one at my truck.

14:17.858 --> 14:19.324
-Do you have any
weapons on you right now?

14:19.326 --> 14:20.692
-No.
-I'm gonna check
real quick, okay?

14:20.694 --> 14:21.626
Face that car.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.664
-Do you have any narcotics
or have a history
of using narcotics?

14:26.666 --> 14:29.100
-No.
I think she does though,
like three months ago

14:29.102 --> 14:31.002
she completely changed,
she's super weird now.

14:31.004 --> 14:32.237
-Okay.

14:32.239 --> 14:33.972
-Like I just went to jail
for this and then she called

14:33.974 --> 14:37.909
and told them, the DA, that she
didn't take her bipolar meds

14:37.911 --> 14:40.411
and then I got released
with no charges dropped.

14:40.413 --> 14:41.679
-Okay.

14:41.681 --> 14:43.815
-All charges dropped, and
then now she's doing it again.

14:43.817 --> 14:45.116
All over again.

14:45.118 --> 14:46.751
-Okay. Sounds like you need
to stay away from her then.

14:46.753 --> 14:50.021
Hang tight right here.
-I already know, and I was
going to get a, like a--

14:50.023 --> 14:51.890
I was trying to get her to
leave so I could go get an--

14:51.892 --> 14:53.124
-An RO?

14:53.126 --> 14:54.859
-Yeah.
And like--

14:54.861 --> 14:56.861
-Hang tight here,
we'll go talk to her.

14:58.365 --> 15:00.365
-You Holly?
What's going on?

15:00.367 --> 15:02.500
-I'm just trying to get my stuff
and I have no gas

15:02.502 --> 15:04.102
and he said
he would give me some.

15:07.107 --> 15:09.741
And he gave me a black eye
and he choked me

15:09.743 --> 15:11.542
and scraped my knees.

15:11.544 --> 15:13.211
-When was this?
-Just now.

15:13.213 --> 15:14.879
-Just now?
Okay.

15:14.881 --> 15:16.114
-I'm just trying
to get my stuff.

15:16.116 --> 15:16.948
-Where's your stuff at?

15:16.950 --> 15:18.116
-It's all by my car.

15:18.118 --> 15:19.217
-In this trailer?

15:19.219 --> 15:20.752
-No, my car
and he damaged my car.

15:20.754 --> 15:22.086
-Where's your car?

15:22.088 --> 15:23.121
Where's your car at?

15:23.123 --> 15:24.188
-That silver one.

15:25.025 --> 15:26.357
He busted it though.

15:28.762 --> 15:30.561
-When?
-This morning.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.398
-Okay.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.732
-Hey, Holly?

15:34.734 --> 15:38.269
He said you had a hammer
and a bat,
do you have that on you?

15:38.271 --> 15:39.337
-No!

15:39.339 --> 15:42.307
Because he started
beating my car and me up.

15:42.309 --> 15:43.608
-This is her car.

15:43.610 --> 15:46.611
She said he bashed the
window out this morning but,

15:46.613 --> 15:51.849
I'm not seeing any
broken glass anywhere.

15:51.851 --> 15:53.584
If it was bashed out
this morning
you'd think there'd be

15:53.586 --> 15:55.320
some broken glass
in there still.

15:56.790 --> 15:59.757
So apparently this is where
their storage shed is.

15:59.759 --> 16:01.259
Where everything is located.

16:02.162 --> 16:05.964
This would be the hammer
there that she probably used.

16:05.966 --> 16:07.031
-Holly:
I didn't do that, I swear.

16:07.033 --> 16:08.433
-Would you mind standing
and face that way.

16:08.435 --> 16:09.968
-She's on probation.

16:09.970 --> 16:11.636
-I didn't hurt him, officer.
-I know, I get it.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.805
-I didn't hurt him.
-We need to figure it out.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.173
-He left me.

16:15.175 --> 16:16.774
-Why do you guys keep
fighting like this?

16:16.776 --> 16:18.910
-Because I was
trying to leave him.

16:18.912 --> 16:20.545
I don't have any gas.

16:20.547 --> 16:21.946
-Hey, Holly,
you're on probation.

16:21.948 --> 16:23.348
I'm gonna detain you
in handcuffs.

16:23.350 --> 16:24.916
-I'm on probation for stealing.

16:24.918 --> 16:26.751
-Correct.
I'm gonna detain you
in handcuffs.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.152
You're not
under arrest yet, okay?

16:28.154 --> 16:29.187
Do you understand?

16:29.189 --> 16:30.788
-Yes, officer,
I just didn't do anything.

16:30.790 --> 16:32.256
-We're gonna figure things out.

16:32.258 --> 16:33.958
-Holly, is there
any needles in here?

16:33.960 --> 16:36.461
-There's-- no.
-Is there needles?

16:36.463 --> 16:37.395
-No.
-Is there dope?

16:37.397 --> 16:38.830
-Yes, that's his dope.

16:38.832 --> 16:40.231
-His dope, is there
a pipe in here?

16:40.233 --> 16:41.799
-Yeah.
-That's his.

16:41.801 --> 16:43.067
-He has a whole bunch.

16:43.069 --> 16:44.535
-A lot of his stuff
in your purse.

16:44.537 --> 16:47.271
-Sorry, I was just trying
to get it away from him.

16:47.273 --> 16:50.208
And that's-- I swear.

16:50.210 --> 16:52.310
I took that away from him.

16:52.312 --> 16:53.678
-And you put it
in your purse?

16:53.680 --> 16:54.746
-Yeah.

16:54.748 --> 16:57.048
-All right, let's see
what he has to say.

16:57.050 --> 17:01.419
All right, man, she was
saying that you punched out
her car window

17:01.421 --> 17:04.555
and like tried to assault her
and choke her.

17:05.825 --> 17:07.892
Any of that true?
-No.

17:07.894 --> 17:09.794
-She had some dope
and she said it was yours.
-No.

17:09.796 --> 17:13.398
But like, you guys just sent me
to jail because of her lies.

17:13.400 --> 17:16.167
She called and said,
told the DA that she took--

17:16.169 --> 17:18.036
she didn't take
her bipolar meds,

17:18.038 --> 17:19.170
which is true,
and I got let out.

17:19.172 --> 17:20.905
I am not planning
to do that for her.

17:20.907 --> 17:21.739
-Okay.

17:21.741 --> 17:24.175
-Like, she is (bleep) crazy.

17:24.177 --> 17:25.576
She's (bleep)--
she's throwing like.

17:25.578 --> 17:26.944
-Did she hit you
with that hammer?

17:26.946 --> 17:29.147
-Uh, no, she swung it at me
a bunch of times though.

17:29.149 --> 17:30.081
-She swung it at you?

17:30.083 --> 17:31.716
-And like the big dent
on her car,

17:31.718 --> 17:33.384
she was first
to (bleep) up cars.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.620
And like she threw a hammer
at my truck and then she tries

17:35.622 --> 17:38.022
to hit it with a monkey wrench
and I grabbed her hand

17:38.024 --> 17:40.358
and then the monkey wrench
swung down and dented her car.

17:40.360 --> 17:41.392
-Okay.

17:41.394 --> 17:42.493
-Like, her windows
have been busted out.

17:42.495 --> 17:44.362
I tried to fix them
for her and she steals.

17:44.364 --> 17:46.464
-Okay.
-Three months ago, she
became a different person.

17:46.466 --> 17:48.232
-Do you wanna press charges?

17:48.234 --> 17:49.434
-(bleep), yeah,
I'll press charges.

17:49.436 --> 17:50.334
-Okay.

17:50.336 --> 17:51.869
Did she hit you with any object?

17:51.871 --> 17:53.337
-She hit me with
a (bleep) bat.

17:53.339 --> 17:55.006
-With a bat?
What kind of bat was it?

17:55.008 --> 17:57.108
-A little like,
it's a Louisville Slugger

17:57.110 --> 17:58.509
that I chopped down

17:58.511 --> 18:00.711
and I put a (bleep)--
it's for checking tires.

18:00.713 --> 18:02.046
-Okay.

18:02.048 --> 18:03.381
-Yeah, like, I broke up with her
'cause she got too violent.

18:03.383 --> 18:05.183
-Yeah.
-I don't wanna live like that.

18:05.185 --> 18:06.951
-Right, right.
It's very inconvenient.
-Yeah.

18:06.953 --> 18:09.020
-Anyway, hang tight, I've gotta
pull up a picture real quick

18:09.022 --> 18:10.955
and then we'll go talk
to her one last time.

18:12.358 --> 18:14.025
-How old are you?
-23 years old.

18:14.027 --> 18:15.660
-You're 23, where are
you from originally?

18:15.662 --> 18:16.494
-Citrus Heights.

18:16.496 --> 18:18.029
-How'd you get here?

18:18.031 --> 18:19.263
How'd you end up here?

18:19.265 --> 18:23.868
-I had been living with Drew
for, uh... two years now.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.870
-And how long have you guys
been doing coke for?

18:26.873 --> 18:31.242
-Well I personally have
done it on and off for about

18:31.244 --> 18:32.376
two years now.

18:32.378 --> 18:33.244
-Two years?

18:33.246 --> 18:34.078
-On and off.

18:34.080 --> 18:36.314
But I don't know about Drew.

18:36.316 --> 18:38.116
-Okay.
-I can't say for him.

18:38.118 --> 18:39.917
-Well it's pretty evident
you need some help.

18:39.919 --> 18:41.119
-I do, but...

18:42.355 --> 18:44.889
I don't get why I have to be
arrested for it when I didn't--

18:44.891 --> 18:49.093
I swear I didn't use a--
the weapon doesn't even
show no blood on it.

18:49.095 --> 18:51.395
-Well his wounds
tell a different story.

18:51.397 --> 18:53.131
-What about my wounds?
What about my nose and my--

18:53.133 --> 18:55.199
-You said they're old.
-They're not old.
They're from recent.

18:55.201 --> 18:56.701
-You told my partner
they're old.
-No, I said--

18:56.703 --> 18:57.635
-Not from today.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.270
-The nose one
was from yesterday.

18:59.272 --> 19:00.738
-We're talking about right now.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.607
-I didn't hit him
at all, I swear.

19:02.609 --> 19:03.608
-And here we are.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.110
-I'm just trying to do
the right thing and leave.

19:06.112 --> 19:07.145
-Alright, well, you need help.

19:07.147 --> 19:09.213
I hope you get it.

19:09.215 --> 19:11.315
-How is this fair?

19:11.317 --> 19:13.284
-Okay.
All right, have a seat.

19:13.286 --> 19:14.118
-Yes, sir.

19:14.120 --> 19:15.052
-Thank you.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.389
-All right, you're being
arrested for domestic violence

19:18.391 --> 19:19.724
and assault with
a deadly weapon.

19:19.726 --> 19:20.825
-I didn't.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.593
-We're here for something
that happened about

19:22.595 --> 19:24.829
30 minutes ago, not yesterday.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.797
-I didn't do anything to him.

19:28.001 --> 19:29.767
-Is that the bat?
-Yeah.

19:29.769 --> 19:31.469
-She struck you with this?
-Yeah.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.304
-And this could do
some serious damage.

19:33.306 --> 19:34.472
-Yeah.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.474
-So she's going for assault
with a deadly weapon

19:36.476 --> 19:38.242
and domestic violence
against you, so good luck.

19:38.244 --> 19:39.343
-Drew:
Hey, I appreciate it, man.

19:39.345 --> 19:40.745
-Officer: No problem.
-Drew: Thank you.

19:41.414 --> 19:43.814
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:43.816 --> 19:45.716
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:45.718 --> 19:47.051
Cover is code three.

19:47.053 --> 19:49.587
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)
