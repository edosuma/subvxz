a fellow man of science.

09:55.963 --> 09:57.562
Maybe if we teamed up,

09:57.564 --> 09:59.698
we could, uh,
figure something out.

09:59.700 --> 10:04.436
Okay. Eh, but remember, to
me you're incredibly stupid.

10:04.438 --> 10:07.105
Oh, and the annoying

10:07.107 --> 10:10.709
Meanwhile, Leela,
take Homer and explore
this time period.

10:10.711 --> 10:15.146
Find out why people would
ever pay for "freemium games."

10:15.148 --> 10:16.314
I'll explain.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.883
Okay, it <i>starts</i> free,
right?

10:18.885 --> 10:20.919
<i>Then</i> you visit
your friend's game,

10:20.921 --> 10:23.388
and he's got this awesome candy
mansion...

10:23.390 --> 10:26.591
Get a load
of those freaks!

10:26.593 --> 10:28.460
And you're like, "99 cents?!

10:28.462 --> 10:30.695
You bet I'd like one!"

10:34.600 --> 10:36.234
And that's why I owe

10:36.236 --> 10:38.603
Clash of Candies $20,000.

10:38.605 --> 10:40.005
Here we are.

10:40.007 --> 10:43.808
Marge, I'd like you
to meet Leela and Fry.

10:43.810 --> 10:46.411
MARGE:
<i>Oh, don't mention her eye.</i>
<i>Don't mention her eye.</i>

10:46.413 --> 10:48.747
LEELA:
<i>Don't mention her hair.</i>
<i>Don't mention her hair.</i>

10:48.749 --> 10:51.349
I... am so pleased
to meet you.

10:51.351 --> 10:53.084
Nice to be hair.

10:53.086 --> 10:54.285
(laughs)
(soft grumble)

10:54.287 --> 10:56.454
Oh, Lord.

10:56.456 --> 10:58.823
(professors mumbling)

10:58.825 --> 11:00.358
Professor Farnsworth,

11:00.360 --> 11:01.926
I'm dying to know
how you got here.

11:01.928 --> 11:04.429
Was it a
time machine?
Little girl,

11:04.431 --> 11:06.965
time machines are
physical impossibilities.

11:06.967 --> 11:09.034
We teleported
through a singularity

11:09.036 --> 11:11.002
that I quantum entangled
to Bender

11:11.004 --> 11:13.638
under the guise
of fixing his collar.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.640
Yes, but how
did Bender get here?

11:15.642 --> 11:17.776
With a time machine.
But you just said that...

11:17.778 --> 11:19.377
(bell dings)
Sample's ready!

11:20.112 --> 11:21.179
(snores)

11:21.181 --> 11:22.480
Kill all humans.

11:22.482 --> 11:25.050
(snores)
Kill all humans.

11:25.052 --> 11:26.618
(snores)

11:26.620 --> 11:28.053
Start with Flanders.

11:28.055 --> 11:29.287
(snores)

11:29.289 --> 11:30.522
Start with Flanders.

11:30.524 --> 11:32.791
Good news, everyone!

11:32.793 --> 11:34.359
That means it's bad.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.194
The human DNA
in the creatures

11:36.196 --> 11:37.629
was only
half Homer's.

11:37.631 --> 11:39.497
The other half came from...

11:39.499 --> 11:41.166
someone else.

11:41.168 --> 11:43.535
Oh, so we can kill
that person instead.

11:43.537 --> 11:45.170
Maybe they're evil
and deserve it.

11:45.172 --> 11:47.639
Or have one of those
annoying <i>voices</i>

11:47.641 --> 11:49.207
that gets on everybody's nerves,

11:49.209 --> 11:52.143
with the adding extra
noises for no reason.

11:52.145 --> 11:53.545
Myveen.

11:53.547 --> 11:55.647
Bloingy.

11:55.649 --> 11:57.916
And the other person is...

12:01.253 --> 12:02.554
HOMER:
Oh, who's that?

12:02.556 --> 12:04.556
It's me.
(gasps)

12:04.558 --> 12:06.891
Wait a minute. We don't
have to kill you.

12:06.893 --> 12:08.660
Oh, well, that's better.

12:08.662 --> 12:10.995
We just have to kill
all your children.

12:10.997 --> 12:12.997
(exclaims)
Or just one of them.

12:12.999 --> 12:16.668
If you can figure out which
one sired the killer rabbits.

12:16.670 --> 12:18.369
(whistling)

12:18.371 --> 12:19.571
(rattling)

12:19.573 --> 12:20.839
We interrupt this hologram

12:20.841 --> 12:22.941
to bring you an
important bulletin.

12:22.943 --> 12:25.577
The horrific creatures
destroying New New York

12:25.579 --> 12:27.412
have begun
metamorphosing.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.680
(laughs)

12:28.682 --> 12:31.249
(muffled screaming)

12:33.352 --> 12:35.353
(grunting)

12:35.355 --> 12:36.621
(all growling)

12:36.623 --> 12:38.022
(man gasping)

12:38.024 --> 12:40.191
Eat my shorts!
<i>¡Ay, caramba!</i>

12:40.193 --> 12:41.860
<i>¡Ay, caramba!</i>

12:42.194 --> 12:43.695
(laughs)

12:43.697 --> 12:45.897
What a surprise.
It's Bart.

12:45.899 --> 12:47.198
Wow,

12:47.200 --> 12:49.567
I'm doing the same jokes
a thousand years later.

12:49.569 --> 12:50.869
<i>¡Ay, caramba!</i>

12:50.871 --> 12:54.139
But how did a mere boy
destroy the future?

12:54.141 --> 12:55.473
Well...

13:05.618 --> 13:07.285
<i>Let this be a lesson.</i>

13:07.287 --> 13:10.155
<i>Never throw meaningless crap</i>
<i>in a time capsule.</i>

13:10.157 --> 13:13.892
That's it! All we have to do
is dig up the time capsule.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.493
And bury Bart in the hole.

13:15.495 --> 13:17.228
I thought people
in the future

13:17.230 --> 13:19.430
would be more full
of peace and love.

13:19.432 --> 13:20.965
Like in Epcot Center.

13:20.967 --> 13:24.068
In our time, Epcot Center
is a work farm for the weak.

13:24.070 --> 13:25.637
Oh, but it's
not as crowded

13:25.639 --> 13:29.340
as the slave labor camps
at Universal Studios.

13:29.342 --> 13:30.775
(grumbles)

13:30.777 --> 13:32.744
(tires screeching)

13:32.746 --> 13:34.145
HOMER:
We're here.

13:38.617 --> 13:40.084
(chuckles)
My bowling buddy.

13:40.086 --> 13:41.619
GROUNDSKEEPER WILLIE:
Hey!

13:41.621 --> 13:44.355
You can't dig that up
for a thousand years.

13:44.357 --> 13:45.957
Plus, I wrote
my name there.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.792
See?

13:47.794 --> 13:49.194
(rattling)

13:49.196 --> 13:50.595
Shmayday!

13:50.597 --> 13:53.498
Shmayday! (gasps)
They got Scruffy!

13:53.500 --> 13:55.333
Nope. They just
got my mustache.

13:55.335 --> 13:58.203
But a life without a mustache
ain't worth livin'.

13:59.605 --> 14:01.005
FARNSWORTH:
No!

14:01.007 --> 14:03.107
That generator
powers the portal.

14:03.109 --> 14:05.143
If they destroy it,
we'll be...

14:05.145 --> 14:06.277
(exclaims)

14:06.279 --> 14:07.478
(grunts)

14:07.480 --> 14:10.048
...sucked back
into the future.

14:15.454 --> 14:18.690
Okay, head count.
One, two, three... (gasps)

14:18.692 --> 14:20.558
Where's Maggie?

14:22.628 --> 14:24.162
Well, little meatbag,

14:24.164 --> 14:26.564
it looks like it's
just you and me.

14:26.566 --> 14:28.633
Stuck in a terrible past

14:28.635 --> 14:29.968
where I know the result

14:29.970 --> 14:32.704
of every horse race ever!

14:32.706 --> 14:34.973
To the track!

14:37.710 --> 14:39.978
I want that.
Well, you can't have it.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.921
Why, you little...
Why, you little...

14:49.923 --> 14:51.589
Why, you little...

14:51.591 --> 14:53.324
Why, you little...
Why, you little...

14:53.326 --> 14:54.926
Dad, it's me.

14:54.928 --> 14:56.561
Prove it.
When's your birthday?

14:56.563 --> 14:57.862
February 23rd.

14:57.864 --> 15:00.198
Ha! February has no 23rd.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.733
You... (grunts)
(grunting)

15:01.735 --> 15:03.234
Yes, it does.

15:03.236 --> 15:06.271
Can you please just get us
out of this lousy future?

15:06.273 --> 15:10.275
Actually, of all probable
futures, this is the worst.

15:10.277 --> 15:12.844
It is, 'cause
my baby's not in it.

15:12.846 --> 15:14.512
Motherly love.

15:14.514 --> 15:16.347
Why did we outlaw that?

15:16.349 --> 15:20.018
Madam, our mechanical friend
Bender is your portal home.

15:20.020 --> 15:23.121
But we can't use him until
the generator is repaired.

15:23.123 --> 15:25.356
Homer works
at a nuclear plant.

15:25.358 --> 15:26.891
He can help us get home.

15:26.893 --> 15:28.960
Oh, are you good
at your job?

15:28.962 --> 15:31.095
I was voted employee
of the month

15:31.097 --> 15:33.298
as an April
Fools' Day joke.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.366
Why, you little...
Why, you little...

15:35.368 --> 15:36.768
Great.

15:36.770 --> 15:38.903
You and Fry
can bumble around together

15:38.905 --> 15:41.539
while the rest of us
give up and make peace

15:41.541 --> 15:43.608
with our various deities.

15:43.610 --> 15:46.878
As for me, I'm an atheist.

15:46.880 --> 15:49.247
Oh, nobody's father,
who art nowhere,

15:49.249 --> 15:52.050
I know you can't hear me,
completely ignore this prayer.

15:52.052 --> 15:55.920
Nothing art thou and nothing
will thou ever be.

15:55.922 --> 15:58.790
Jesus was just a man.

15:58.792 --> 16:00.458
ALL:
Amen.

16:00.460 --> 16:04.162
Well, I shall stay here
for the decadence.

16:04.164 --> 16:07.932
There's no debauchery like
end-of-the-world debauchery.

16:07.934 --> 16:10.435
Your lips, my lips,
apocalypse, ooh!

16:10.437 --> 16:13.271
I can't believe you're all
giving up without a fight.

16:13.273 --> 16:14.672
Lisa,

16:14.674 --> 16:17.008
we're just a package
delivery service.

16:17.010 --> 16:18.343
And not a very
good one.

16:18.345 --> 16:20.078
The only way to handle
the creatures

16:20.080 --> 16:22.146
is to do what we do
to each year's

16:22.148 --> 16:25.249
Super Bowl losers:
shoot them into space.

16:25.251 --> 16:27.518
But we'd have to
round them up first.

16:27.520 --> 16:28.920
Let me take care of that.

16:28.922 --> 16:30.588
If there's one thing
I know how to do,

16:30.590 --> 16:32.256
it's manipulate Bart.

16:32.258 --> 16:34.926
You're nuts.
I've got a will of iron.

16:34.928 --> 16:36.494
(deep humming)

16:38.931 --> 16:41.032
(mumbles)

16:41.034 --> 16:43.334
Okay, let's get going.

16:44.536 --> 16:46.004
(drooling)

16:46.805 --> 16:49.107
Dad, we have beer
in our time.

16:49.109 --> 16:52.944
Hey, I haven't had a drink
in a thousand years.

16:52.946 --> 16:54.512
(horse neighs)

16:54.514 --> 16:58.282
(gasps) There's a horse
called Bender's Bounty.

16:58.284 --> 17:00.451
But my memory says
he died during the race.

17:00.453 --> 17:02.286
That can't be true.

17:02.288 --> 17:04.856
ANNOUNCER:
And way, way, way back
is Bender's Bounty.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.524
Damn it!

17:08.394 --> 17:10.328
Oh, chief, it
looks like a robot

17:10.330 --> 17:11.963
killing horses
over there.

17:11.965 --> 17:13.331
Oh, a 608...

17:13.333 --> 17:16.134
Lou, can't you just
let me enjoy my day off?

17:16.136 --> 17:18.302
W-Why are you dressed
in your uniform, then?

17:18.304 --> 17:20.338
'Cause they're
the only clothes that fit me.

17:20.340 --> 17:21.672
You happy? Happy?

17:21.674 --> 17:23.741
Attention, goblins.

17:23.743 --> 17:27.478
Madison Cube Garden is filled
with Butterfinger bars.

17:27.480 --> 17:30.014
And people are laying
fingers all over them.

17:30.016 --> 17:31.983
(cackling, grunting)

17:31.985 --> 17:34.218
They're evolving. Wow.

17:34.220 --> 17:36.354
That's a first for you, Bart.

17:36.356 --> 17:38.222
Will you shut up?

17:38.224 --> 17:40.491
(gentle melody plays)
(grunting)

17:55.174 --> 17:58.810
Uh, did I remind you
to strap yourselves in?

18:07.886 --> 18:09.887
(all cheering)

18:09.889 --> 18:11.622
You realize you're
cheering the death

18:11.624 --> 18:13.524
of millions of my children.

18:13.526 --> 18:15.827
(all cheering)

18:22.367 --> 18:24.068
Wow,

18:24.070 --> 18:26.204
it's working.
I guess the instructions

18:26.206 --> 18:27.805
<i>were</i> in English.

18:27.807 --> 18:28.940
What the...

18:28.942 --> 18:31.476
Whoa!

18:31.478 --> 18:35.379
Hey, here's a souvenir photo of
you guys coming out of my chest.

18:35.381 --> 18:38.483
Aw, I will treasure
this forever.

18:38.485 --> 18:39.750
Lie detected.

18:39.752 --> 18:43.488
Oh, my sweet baby.

18:43.490 --> 18:46.390
Oh, feels like
you have a full diaper.

18:46.392 --> 18:49.127
Ooh, um, I'll
change her.

18:52.097 --> 18:54.365
(whispers):
Here's your cut.

18:55.634 --> 18:57.101
Nice knowing you,
meatbags.

18:57.103 --> 18:58.503
Have fun turning
to dust.

18:58.505 --> 19:00.838
Wait, wait, wait.
You're the portal.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.974
How are you gonna
get to the future?

19:02.976 --> 19:05.243
The old-fashioned way.

19:09.248 --> 19:10.982
Good night, friend.

19:10.984 --> 19:13.184
You'll always have
a special place

19:13.186 --> 19:14.852
here with us.

19:14.854 --> 19:18.189
(grunting)

19:32.771 --> 19:34.839
Thanks, pal.

19:47.719 --> 19:49.287
Look at this mess.

19:49.289 --> 19:51.455
It would have
disintegrated upon entry

19:51.457 --> 19:54.859
if someone hadn't turned off
the atmosphere last night.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.827
I like it cold
when I'm sleeping.

19:56.829 --> 20:00.298
Besides, these horrible
Earth creatures are delicious.

20:00.300 --> 20:03.534
The Johnsons will be here
for dinner any minute.

20:03.536 --> 20:06.037
What happened
to the handsome man I married?

20:06.039 --> 20:07.638
I ate him, remember?

20:07.640 --> 20:09.040
Here they are.

20:09.042 --> 20:11.042
Uh, hmm...

20:11.044 --> 20:13.878
Hope we're not
interrupting anything.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.046
(burps)

20:15.048 --> 20:18.149
I can't take any more.

20:18.151 --> 20:20.418
(sobbing)

20:21.653 --> 20:23.054
I-I can't
take it.

20:23.056 --> 20:25.056
Well, perhaps the one of you
that is female

20:25.058 --> 20:26.924
should go console her.
