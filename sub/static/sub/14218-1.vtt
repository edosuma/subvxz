00:18.518 --> 00:20.019
I...

00:21.062 --> 00:23.522
I forgive you for everything, Melizza.

00:24.524 --> 00:27.026
Do you hear? For everything.

00:29.446 --> 00:31.572
But... but now I need you.

00:32.782 --> 00:34.992
Just once more, I need you.

00:36.327 --> 00:38.537
You must come back to me, Melizza.

03:35.590 --> 03:38.342
- Good night.
- Good night. Ha-ha-ha-ha!

04:32.522 --> 04:34.731
Fantastic.

04:34.857 --> 04:37.818
- Yes, but of course...
- Shh. Wait.

04:42.865 --> 04:46.034
- Amazing.
- Yes, Bruno, it's really great.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.036
I'm impressed.

04:48.162 --> 04:50.247
- Max, what do you think?
- Interesting.

04:50.373 --> 04:53.000
Formal, but interesting.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.835
- Formal?
- Yeah, sure.

04:54.961 --> 04:57.546
It is a bit formal, isn't it?

04:57.672 --> 05:00.257
Yes, Max is right. It's formal.

05:00.383 --> 05:02.718
Oh, it's an experiment.

05:02.844 --> 05:05.012
What about the painting, Max?

05:05.138 --> 05:08.515
What? You have a new painting, Max?

05:08.641 --> 05:09.850
Yes, it's true.

05:09.976 --> 05:12.936
And this time, he's promised
that I'll be recognizable.

05:13.062 --> 05:15.772
And you have it here now?

05:15.898 --> 05:19.985
You're about to witness
an historic occasion,

05:20.111 --> 05:23.488
the first public presentation
of quantum painting.

05:23.614 --> 05:25.490
Quantum painting?

05:25.616 --> 05:29.369
I have perfected an instrument,
a liquid gun,

05:29.495 --> 05:35.584
by which I am able to apply the laws
of quantum physics to my art.

05:37.128 --> 05:38.837
Hey, Max.

05:38.963 --> 05:40.922
That's pretty good.

05:41.049 --> 05:45.886
So, you can paint a real picture
after all. It even looks like me.

05:46.012 --> 05:50.057
Max, I don't understand this.
It's... it's formal.

05:50.183 --> 05:54.019
It... it's a joke?

05:54.145 --> 05:55.145
A hoax?

05:55.271 --> 06:00.734
And because of the paradoxical nature
of quantum theory,

06:00.860 --> 06:05.238
it is necessary that
the energy be superimposed

06:05.365 --> 06:08.075
upon a completely formal image.

06:09.077 --> 06:13.288
This is achieved by means
of the quantum gun.

06:15.073 --> 06:17.000
Signor Max, please.

06:17.126 --> 06:20.253
- Ha-ha-ha-ha! What...
- Quiet, you fool!

06:21.381 --> 06:23.382
I am about to astound the world.

06:26.677 --> 06:31.807
The quantum gun contains a tiny
projectile loaded with pigment.

06:31.933 --> 06:35.477
When it strikes the canvas
with tremendous velocity...

06:35.603 --> 06:37.979
But you shall see.

06:38.106 --> 06:42.109
The canvas even now is ready
to receive its quantum of energy.

06:43.277 --> 06:45.946
Hey, Max, what are you doing?
Are you crazy?

06:49.700 --> 06:51.368
Wow! Did you see that?

06:54.789 --> 06:57.457
- This looks astounding!
- I warn you!

06:57.583 --> 07:01.545
- Never seen anything like it.
- Yes, Max, you've done it again.

07:01.671 --> 07:03.046
Look!

07:03.172 --> 07:05.215
Millions of tiny little flicks.

07:06.592 --> 07:09.928
- Like the universe.
- That's my face, Max.

07:10.054 --> 07:13.598
- That isn't funny.
- Of course it's not funny.

07:13.724 --> 07:16.393
It's... it's brilliant. It's tremendous.

07:16.519 --> 07:20.230
- It's pure quantum energy.
- Well, I think it's puerile.

07:20.356 --> 07:23.900
You think? What does it matter
what you think? I am the artist!

07:24.026 --> 07:28.029
Signor Max, please. I have a buyer,
a professional buyer.

07:31.075 --> 07:33.577
Perhaps I can be
of some assistance, madam?

07:33.703 --> 07:36.037
If there is any particular painting...

07:36.164 --> 07:38.957
Oh, there is.

07:39.083 --> 07:42.669
Have you anything by this fellow
who paints these...

07:42.795 --> 07:45.046
these dead red nudes?

07:45.173 --> 07:48.049
Ah, Antonio Sordi.

07:48.968 --> 07:53.388
Madame, you... you are indeed
fortunate. I... I have just one.

07:53.514 --> 07:55.557
The latest one, in fact.

08:10.156 --> 08:12.532
Oh, yes! Exactly.

08:13.576 --> 08:16.745
- I'll take it.
- The world is full of idiots.

08:17.914 --> 08:20.624
Genuine Sordi. Genuine nobody.

08:22.084 --> 08:24.002
Dead red nudes.

08:24.128 --> 08:25.962
I think it's rather good.

08:26.088 --> 08:29.424
Very well. I shall paint your portrait.

08:29.550 --> 08:32.385
Right now, for all posterity.

08:36.182 --> 08:39.226
I shall entitle it,
"Portrait of an Idiot".

08:40.561 --> 08:42.562
You will be famous.

08:46.108 --> 08:48.193
Portrait...

08:49.654 --> 08:51.571
of an...

08:52.573 --> 08:54.241
- idiot.
- Hey!

08:55.701 --> 08:58.286
Wait. Wait! Amazing!

08:59.497 --> 09:01.581
The form. The composition.

09:01.707 --> 09:04.125
More! More!

09:04.252 --> 09:06.753
I shall astound the world.

09:06.879 --> 09:08.588
Daisy?

09:52.383 --> 09:54.718
No, no, no, no. No, no, no.

09:54.844 --> 09:57.637
Darling, you do not understand. You do...

09:57.763 --> 10:00.557
The movement is mechanically simple,

10:00.683 --> 10:03.643
but... but you must create the agony,

10:03.769 --> 10:06.187
the agony of the soul of the earth,

10:06.314 --> 10:09.107
which is struggling,
struggling to free itself

10:09.233 --> 10:11.568
from... from the cosmic current

10:11.694 --> 10:17.407
which is binding it irresistibly
to the primordial energy ocean.

10:17.533 --> 10:21.161
Now, darling, please.
Please let's try again. Please.

10:21.287 --> 10:23.121
I don't know if I understand it yet.

10:23.247 --> 10:25.874
Don't... don't say that, darling.
Don't say that word, please.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.126
Just remember the soul of the earth.

10:28.252 --> 10:30.378
Please, darling, let's try again.

10:40.931 --> 10:43.224
This is it! This is it!

10:43.351 --> 10:45.727
Darling, this is the soul of the earth.

10:45.853 --> 10:47.729
Girls, thank you very much. Good night.

10:47.855 --> 10:51.441
We will create again tomorrow.
Thank you very much!

10:51.567 --> 10:53.485
Daisy, hi.

10:53.611 --> 10:56.780
Dorean, what do you call that?

10:56.906 --> 11:01.576
That's a very serious moment
in a very serious new ballet.

11:01.702 --> 11:05.664
All very far out, you know.
Come on, while I change.

11:05.790 --> 11:10.585
No, no, no, girls! You don't
understand, girls! You do not...

11:10.711 --> 11:14.130
Speaking of crazy artists, how's that Max?

11:14.256 --> 11:17.092
Max? Oh, yeah, Max.

11:17.218 --> 11:19.135
Well...

11:19.261 --> 11:22.180
Dorean, I was thinking about moving
back into your place for a while.

11:22.306 --> 11:24.099
If it's alright with you.

11:24.225 --> 11:28.269
Oh, sure, Daisy, of course. Most
of your stuff's still there anyway.

11:29.730 --> 11:34.442
Hey, Daisy, I'm glad.
I think that Max is a kook anyway.

11:34.568 --> 11:36.152
Got your keys?

11:36.278 --> 11:38.738
Yes. Aren't you coming home now?

11:39.949 --> 11:42.325
No, I'm meeting someone.

11:42.451 --> 11:46.621
Oh, I thought there were rules
around here about ballet

11:46.747 --> 11:49.416
and, er... outside attachments.

11:50.668 --> 11:53.336
There are, but no one's gonna find out.

11:54.338 --> 11:56.923
I'm being very discreet.

11:57.049 --> 11:59.801
We have a secret meeting place
down by the beach.

11:59.927 --> 12:04.013
Why are you being so discreet?
You really should be careful.

12:04.140 --> 12:06.391
You're a little naive
when it comes to men.

14:34.331 --> 14:36.249
- Oh!
- Oh, I... I'm sorry.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.585
I frightened you.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.753
Don't be afraid. I'll leave if you like.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.131
Oh. Oh, no. I'm all right.

14:44.174 --> 14:45.174
Don't go.

14:45.301 --> 14:48.344
It's just that I was looking
at those pictures in the window.

14:49.430 --> 14:51.639
They're kind of spooky and I...

14:54.768 --> 14:58.104
- Are you?
- Mm, yes, Antonio Sordi.

14:59.356 --> 15:04.402
I, er... come here quite often
to look at my lost children.

15:04.528 --> 15:07.238
Well, I can understand that.

15:07.364 --> 15:11.743
It was silly of me to be frightened.
It's just that the pictures are so...

15:11.869 --> 15:14.037
Yes, I know, gruesome.

15:14.163 --> 15:16.331
Yes.

15:18.667 --> 15:20.543
But fascinating.

15:21.545 --> 15:23.880
Like looking down from a high place.

15:25.341 --> 15:27.926
It... it frightens you because...

15:28.052 --> 15:30.970
it makes you realize
that you'd like to jump off.

15:32.598 --> 15:35.600
It shows you that
the horror of death is that you...

15:36.894 --> 15:38.770
desire it.

15:38.896 --> 15:42.982
That's a very astute observation.
Are you an artist?

15:43.108 --> 15:45.109
Oh, no.

15:45.235 --> 15:47.654
But I often contribute to the work of...

15:47.780 --> 15:49.572
others.

15:49.698 --> 15:52.659
I suppose I should introduce myself.

15:52.785 --> 15:56.120
My name is Daisy Allen
and I'm a student of this and that

15:56.246 --> 15:57.664
and...

15:57.790 --> 16:00.750
I'm talking an awful lot, aren't I?

16:00.876 --> 16:03.378
I'm afraid I had
a little too much to drink.

16:03.504 --> 16:06.047
No, no, not at all.

16:06.173 --> 16:08.841
I'm pleased that
you're no longer frightened.

16:08.968 --> 16:12.345
You may even criticize my work,
if you like.

16:12.471 --> 16:14.555
Well, I certainly shall.

16:15.683 --> 16:18.017
Now, the trouble is...

16:18.143 --> 16:20.436
I don't see enough of it.

16:20.562 --> 16:22.981
Why aren't you home working right now?

16:23.107 --> 16:25.149
You're quite right. I should be.

16:26.110 --> 16:29.654
But it seems my muse has been avoiding me.

16:29.780 --> 16:31.656
You need...

16:32.908 --> 16:34.534
a subject.

16:41.750 --> 16:44.419
Oh, what a marvelous place to work in!

16:45.421 --> 16:47.797
It certainly seems suited to your style.

16:47.923 --> 16:49.716
It's more cheerful during the day.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.521
No doubt.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.221
Say, those bells really get to you,
don't they?

16:55.347 --> 16:59.183
Oh, yes, the bells.
I hardly notice them anymore.

16:59.309 --> 17:01.602
They're right above us in the tower.

17:01.729 --> 17:06.273
You know, they've rung every hour
on the hour since the 11th century.

17:06.400 --> 17:09.444
Except for once, when there wasn't
a Sordi to wind the mechanism.

17:10.362 --> 17:12.155
Sordi?

17:12.281 --> 17:14.866
This some kind of ancestral home of yours?

17:14.992 --> 17:15.992
Yes, at one time.

17:16.117 --> 17:20.747
Now it's a museum, and I'm allowed
to rent this miserable corner...

17:22.082 --> 17:23.624
and wind the clock.

17:23.751 --> 17:26.877
But these are so much better
than any I've seen in the shop.

17:27.003 --> 17:29.255
Such brilliant darkness and death.

17:29.381 --> 17:32.091
That's the essence of what I'm after,

17:32.217 --> 17:36.387
to bring death to the canvas,
as others seek to give it life.

17:36.513 --> 17:38.973
The dead red nudes, they're called.

17:40.017 --> 17:43.061
- Do you know that?
- Oh, it doesn't matter.

17:43.187 --> 17:45.938
These are only steps along the way.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.983
I haven't achieved what I'm after yet.

17:49.109 --> 17:51.444
Soon, perhaps.

17:51.570 --> 17:54.906
Well, anyway, you still have to work
from a live model, don't you?

17:55.908 --> 17:56.908
Of course.

17:58.869 --> 18:00.953
So, where would you like me?

18:01.080 --> 18:03.206
Here, try this.

18:12.883 --> 18:15.259
Just take a relaxed pose,

18:15.385 --> 18:18.471
anything that seems normal
and comfortable.

18:34.571 --> 18:36.364
Are you going to paint me dead?

18:36.490 --> 18:38.908
I never plan a picture.

18:39.034 --> 18:42.829
It must be allowed to grow
according to its own natural law.

18:42.955 --> 18:46.332
- Is this all right?
- It's perfect.

18:46.458 --> 18:49.335
It's a pleasure to have a model
who understands composition.

18:49.461 --> 18:53.256
Well, it's the way you've arranged
the pillows. It feels so natural.

18:57.302 --> 18:59.053
What made the clock stop?

18:59.388 --> 19:01.222
What's that?

19:01.348 --> 19:04.016
The clock up above, with the bell.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.352
You said it stopped once.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.230
Oh, yes, that's right.

19:09.356 --> 19:10.398
Well, it was in the 15th century,

19:10.524 --> 19:13.860
at the time of Erno Sordi,
an ancestor of mine.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.070
He was a great artist, a genius.

19:16.196 --> 19:20.283
Hundreds of years ahead of his time.
He worked here in this very room.

19:21.451 --> 19:25.496
Erno Sordi? I don't think I know the name.

19:25.622 --> 19:28.416
Almost none of his paintings
are in existence today.

19:28.542 --> 19:30.626
Even copies are rare.

19:30.752 --> 19:33.963
But he was greater than Rembrandt,
greater than Titian.

19:34.089 --> 19:36.924
They painted the flesh
and sometimes the soul.

19:37.050 --> 19:39.093
Erno Sordi went deeper.

19:39.219 --> 19:41.345
Beyond the soul.

19:42.472 --> 19:44.640
Of course, he had to be destroyed.

19:45.851 --> 19:48.769
- You don't want to hear all this.
- Oh, please.

19:50.397 --> 19:51.606
I'm fascinated.

19:51.732 --> 19:53.441
Oh.

19:55.611 --> 19:58.905
Erno Sordi's paintings apparently
had a sort of magical power

19:59.031 --> 20:01.157
to affect the viewer.

20:02.284 --> 20:05.119
Modern psychologists would say that he...

20:05.245 --> 20:08.289
depicted the contents
of the unconscious mind.

20:09.917 --> 20:11.792
The Church expressed it
in much the same way

20:11.919 --> 20:14.212
by saying he was in league with the devil,

20:14.338 --> 20:16.780
and only Satan could have inspired it.

20:25.390 --> 20:28.142
He was tried by an ecclesiastical court

20:28.268 --> 20:30.645
and charged with sorcery.

20:33.273 --> 20:38.985
The chief witness against him was
a remarkably beautiful woman.

20:40.572 --> 20:42.531
His mistress...

20:43.951 --> 20:45.952
Melizza.

20:50.123 --> 20:52.458
He was burned at the stake.

20:53.585 --> 20:58.047
All his priceless paintings
were thrown on the fire with him.

20:58.173 --> 21:03.928
His accuser, Melizza, danced around
the flames, laughing hideously...

21:05.180 --> 21:08.031
while the flesh boiled from his body.

21:09.601 --> 21:11.978
He painted a portrait of Melizza.

21:12.980 --> 21:15.898
It had such compelling power,

21:16.024 --> 21:19.485
she thought he'd somehow stolen her soul

21:19.611 --> 21:21.988
and sealed it in the painting.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.199
She was mad.

23:58.437 --> 24:01.188
Tony, where were you? I waited all night.

24:01.314 --> 24:05.443
I'm sorry. You'll forgive me when
you know I finished another painting.

24:05.569 --> 24:07.570
That's wonderful. Of course I forgive you.

24:09.614 --> 24:12.533
Anyway, you're here now
and I'm awfully glad to see you.

24:18.290 --> 24:23.502
You know, I was dreaming just then
that I was in your studio,

24:23.628 --> 24:25.129
dusting a statue,

24:25.255 --> 24:27.506
and you were standing
in a big beam of sunlight,

24:27.632 --> 24:30.551
painting a bright yellow picture.

24:30.677 --> 24:32.428
Then what happened?

24:32.554 --> 24:35.072
You turned around,
looked at me and winked.

24:39.561 --> 24:42.521
Tony, what's your studio really like?

24:43.857 --> 24:47.943
Well, it's not at all
like you dreamed, I assure you.

24:48.069 --> 24:50.070
You must be exhausted.

24:51.114 --> 24:53.782
Being an artist, painting a picture.

24:53.909 --> 24:56.702
Really creating something fine.

24:56.828 --> 24:59.663
It's almost like giving birth
to a child, isn't it?

25:01.958 --> 25:03.209
Tony?

25:03.335 --> 25:05.544
Why can't I come to your studio?

25:05.670 --> 25:09.840
It's not the place for you,
when I work. Soon, perhaps.

25:09.966 --> 25:13.427
We won't talk about it now.
I've got just the thing for you.

25:13.553 --> 25:15.679
- You hungry?
- Mm-hm, very.

25:15.805 --> 25:18.057
A jug of wine,

25:18.183 --> 25:20.392
a loaf of bread and thou.

25:22.145 --> 25:24.396
Come here. You'll cut yourself.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.607
I never can do that.

25:41.039 --> 25:43.415
Do you remember the first day we met?

25:45.001 --> 25:48.546
- How long ago was that?
- Don't you know?

25:48.672 --> 25:51.340
Exactly 15 days and six hours ago.

25:51.466 --> 25:53.884
Is that all?

25:54.010 --> 25:57.179
I remember watching you
from up on the cliffs.

25:57.305 --> 26:00.766
I enjoyed seeing you play in the water.

26:00.892 --> 26:03.102
You looked like a little child.

26:04.396 --> 26:07.106
I can hardly remember my life
before I met you.

26:07.232 --> 26:10.150
Hey, I've got the whole evening off.
Let's go to the opera.

26:10.277 --> 26:13.070
Yeah, I'd love that.

26:13.196 --> 26:17.032
I'm sorry. I can't. I have to see
somebody about business tonight.

26:17.158 --> 26:19.910
- I'll see you tomorrow, won't I?
- Yes, of course.

26:20.036 --> 26:21.579
- Let's go down to the water.
- No.

26:21.705 --> 26:25.291
- Oh, come on.
- No, I like watching you. Go ahead.

26:47.689 --> 26:50.441
So, with the model herself
applied directly to the canvas,

26:50.567 --> 26:54.570
eliminating the necessity
for artificial media such as a brush,

26:54.696 --> 26:57.281
- we can...
- Yes, I see it.

26:57.407 --> 26:59.199
It's magnificent.

26:59.326 --> 27:03.412
The artist directly manipulates
the model on to the canvas,

27:03.538 --> 27:05.664
as he would manipulate a brush.

27:05.790 --> 27:09.335
Exactly. Of course,
this is only an exercise.

27:09.461 --> 27:14.465
Obviously, the next step is to apply
the technique to a full figure study,

27:14.591 --> 27:15.883
possibly even a group.

27:16.009 --> 27:18.177
Right, and by all means a self-portrait.

27:18.303 --> 27:20.471
A group.

27:20.597 --> 27:24.224
It needs something, a towel for the model.

27:27.896 --> 27:29.688
Mm.

27:29.814 --> 27:32.650
Another dead red one. They're good.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.152
The usual terms?

27:35.278 --> 27:39.657
Oh, signor, this time I... I'm going
to need the money right away.

27:39.783 --> 27:43.410
Oh, well, in that case,
I would be taking a risk

27:43.536 --> 27:46.789
so, well, the best I can do is 75.

27:46.915 --> 27:48.707
75?

27:53.546 --> 27:56.346
All right, you thief, just give me
the money and let me get out of here

27:56.466 --> 28:00.094
so I don't have to look
at your greasy face.

28:01.262 --> 28:04.598
An interesting technique.
Quite valid, of course.

28:04.724 --> 28:07.309
But it needs something.

28:07.435 --> 28:10.229
Yes, it does. Max is quite right.
It needs something.

28:10.355 --> 28:14.525
There is something lacking.
But, Bruno, you must see that.

28:14.651 --> 28:16.568
Well, you may be right, but...

28:16.695 --> 28:19.029
Perhaps the element of quantum energy.

28:19.155 --> 28:20.906
Perhaps, but...

28:21.032 --> 28:23.534
Allow me, gentlemen.

28:23.660 --> 28:25.661
- Magnificent!
- Fantastic!

28:25.787 --> 28:27.788
Quantum!

28:27.914 --> 28:30.541
Sordi. We meet at last.

28:32.377 --> 28:34.878
How dare you deface another man's work?

28:35.004 --> 28:37.548
You commercial hack!

28:37.674 --> 28:40.509
I think I'm beginning to understand.

28:40.635 --> 28:43.011
It's really quite interesting. Ingenious.

28:43.138 --> 28:45.597
- What?
- You see how it catches the light?

28:45.724 --> 28:47.182
Idiots.

28:47.308 --> 28:50.144
Yes, and oozes just like it was alive.

28:52.439 --> 28:53.856
Fools!

28:53.982 --> 28:56.024
Ah, the fools!

29:02.782 --> 29:05.826
Daisy! Et tu?

29:30.560 --> 29:33.437
It's getting cold.
Would you like to come in?

29:33.563 --> 29:35.773
I think I'd rather stay here a while.

29:35.899 --> 29:38.650
- Coming?
- Why not? Will you excuse us?

30:16.314 --> 30:18.209
Hello?

30:20.472 --> 30:22.246
Hello?

31:09.117 --> 31:10.534
Pam?

31:11.911 --> 31:14.329
- Pamela?
- What's wrong?

31:14.455 --> 31:16.623
She's not here.

31:18.167 --> 31:21.211
The ground's wet.
Maybe she's gone in swimming.

31:26.426 --> 31:30.345
That's odd. There's a pair
of women's shoes in the pool.

32:17.310 --> 32:19.645
- Max!
- Exactly.

32:19.771 --> 32:22.189
Where have you been?

32:23.191 --> 32:25.192
Anywhere I'm wanted.

32:27.862 --> 32:30.656
Well, you're always welcome here,
Max. You know that.

32:30.782 --> 32:34.785
Well, you may say so,
but what about Daisy?

32:34.911 --> 32:36.954
Well, why wouldn't she?

32:37.080 --> 32:38.872
Is she here now? Could I talk to her?

32:38.998 --> 32:42.668
Well, she isn't here.
I haven't seen her for days.

32:42.794 --> 32:45.921
- I thought she was with you.
- No.

32:46.047 --> 32:50.717
It's not like her to just run off
like that, without saying anything.

32:50.843 --> 32:53.512
I wonder if something's wrong.

32:53.638 --> 32:56.807
- I know someone who's seen her.
- Oh?

32:56.933 --> 33:01.186
Yesterday I saw a new painting of her
done by that hack Sordi.

33:01.312 --> 33:02.980
I thought she only posed for you.

33:03.106 --> 33:07.317
Well, she did,
but we had a little disagreement.

33:07.443 --> 33:10.278
As a matter of fact,
it was more like a fight.

33:10.405 --> 33:14.408
Anyway, I... I haven't
seen her since and...

33:14.534 --> 33:16.868
Well, I miss her.
I'd like to patch things up.

33:16.995 --> 33:19.204
Well, what about whatshisname,
who just painted her?

33:19.330 --> 33:22.124
Maybe he knows where she is.
Why don't you ask him?

33:22.250 --> 33:24.835
Sordi? Out of the question. Never.

33:27.839 --> 33:30.215
It... it's bad enough
that Daisy posed for him.

33:30.341 --> 33:34.136
But if I have to go to him
and ask where she is, well...

33:34.262 --> 33:36.763
it's just out of the question.

33:45.231 --> 33:49.484
This isn't any time to be proud,
Max, if you really want her back.

33:49.610 --> 33:53.697
Yes, but there are just some things
a man can't do.

33:55.658 --> 33:57.367
Do you think maybe you could ask him?

33:57.493 --> 34:00.120
Well, I would like to know where she is.

34:00.246 --> 34:03.123
All right, I'll do it.

34:20.391 --> 34:22.893
- Who's there?
- Mr. Sordi?

34:23.018 --> 34:24.268
Yes. What do you want?

34:24.395 --> 34:28.023
I'm looking for my sister Daisy
Allen. Do you know who I mean?

34:28.149 --> 34:31.400
She posed for you recently, and I
thought you might know where she is.

34:31.527 --> 34:34.862
What makes you think I know her?

34:34.989 --> 34:37.491
Well, a friend of mine saw
the painting you did of her.

34:37.617 --> 34:39.326
I don't know anybody by that name.

34:39.452 --> 34:41.495
Are you sure?

34:41.621 --> 34:45.231
- She has dark hair and...
- I never heard of her.

35:09.524 --> 35:12.484
- Some tower, huh?
- Yes.

35:12.610 --> 35:15.612
Visitors used to come from
all around, just to see it.

35:15.738 --> 35:18.031
But now nobody comes anymore.

35:18.157 --> 35:20.700
Guess the old ones
have forgotten all about it.

35:20.827 --> 35:23.537
And the young ones. What do they know?

35:25.164 --> 35:26.915
I bet you you don't even
know anything about it.

35:27.041 --> 35:29.543
- Know what?
- She says, "Know what?"

35:29.669 --> 35:32.337
The legend. What else? That's
the trouble with you young people.

35:32.463 --> 35:35.549
You think you know everything.
You never listen.

35:35.675 --> 35:39.302
You're just like my son.
He never listens either.

35:40.304 --> 35:43.723
A lot of peculiar things
happened up in there.

35:43.850 --> 35:47.435
But I can't tell you about 'em,
'cause you're just too smart.

35:47.562 --> 35:49.312
But I'd like to know about the legend.

35:49.438 --> 35:52.941
So, find out for yourself.
Don't come bothering me.

35:53.067 --> 35:55.068
I got my own problems.

36:06.914 --> 36:09.541
"Be ye warned, else it happen again.

36:11.043 --> 36:13.295
"In another time,
when the world was young,

36:13.421 --> 36:16.965
"there came to pass an occurrence
most curious and vile.

36:17.091 --> 36:22.429
"One Erno Sordi, a painter,
was burnt to death at the stake

36:22.555 --> 36:27.017
"for casting a spell on his beloved,
the beauteous Melizza.

36:27.143 --> 36:30.645
"Beneath his dwelling,
they did bury his ashes.

36:30.771 --> 36:33.315
"Time passed and all was forgotten.

36:33.441 --> 36:36.151
"Then was the town besieged by a vampire,

36:36.277 --> 36:40.322
"whose foul deeds did fill
the populace with fear and disgust.

36:40.448 --> 36:45.744
"It was the same Sordi, returned
from the dead, bound for vengeance.

36:45.870 --> 36:50.665
"Each night, for many weeks, he did
feast upon the blood of a maid,

36:50.791 --> 36:54.544
"yet even then did the artist
live on in the creature.

36:54.670 --> 36:57.047
"When he had blood enough to suffice,

36:57.173 --> 36:59.883
"then would he take
the insensate forms of his victims

37:00.009 --> 37:03.011
"to the bell tower of the house,
where once he dwelt,

37:03.137 --> 37:05.680
"and there paint them
in the final agony of death.

37:05.806 --> 37:09.017
"But there came a night
when the moon was full

37:09.143 --> 37:12.395
"and the townsmen did find
the track of the vampire

37:12.521 --> 37:15.065
"and follow him to his lair,
high in the tower.

37:15.191 --> 37:18.944
"There, in great haste,
they smote him down,

37:19.070 --> 37:20.862
"driving a stake through his heart,

37:20.988 --> 37:25.784
"whereupon he... he expired
and crumbled unto dust."

37:45.638 --> 37:48.139
Very colorful folklore.

37:48.266 --> 37:50.433
Is that all you can say?

37:50.559 --> 37:53.103
Don't you see the parallel
between this legend

37:53.229 --> 37:56.356
and all those stories in the papers
lately about women disappearing?

37:56.482 --> 37:58.566
And the kind of painting Sordi does.

37:58.693 --> 38:01.152
And one of them looking like Daisy.

38:01.279 --> 38:03.989
And he's living in the tower
that's in the legend.

38:04.115 --> 38:05.949
And his name.

38:06.075 --> 38:10.453
Are you suggesting that Sordi
is a vampire, who abducts women?

38:10.579 --> 38:14.040
I don't know, but there are
no other clues about Daisy.

38:14.166 --> 38:17.252
I'm afraid there's nothing more
we can do. It's up to the police now.

38:17.378 --> 38:20.422
But they don't think
the picture proves anything.

38:20.548 --> 38:22.424
Well, maybe they're right.

38:22.550 --> 38:25.260
Maybe it's not Daisy,
just someone who looks like her.

38:25.386 --> 38:27.554
You don't really believe that, do you?

38:29.265 --> 38:30.265
No.

38:30.391 --> 38:33.184
Why don't we try to find out
for ourselves?

38:33.311 --> 38:36.271
Maybe there's something in the legend
that we don't understand

38:36.397 --> 38:39.941
that would become more clear
if we knew more about him.

38:40.067 --> 38:43.945
I think we should follow him,
watch him very carefully...

38:45.531 --> 38:48.283
and see what he does with his time.

38:48.409 --> 38:49.576
Count me out.

38:49.702 --> 38:55.081
I'm sure that Sordi is many things,
but a vampire is not one of them.

40:47.278 --> 40:49.320
Oh, no!

40:58.414 --> 40:59.956
- Look here!
- I'm sorry.

41:00.082 --> 41:01.499
What's your hurry?

41:04.211 --> 41:06.946
- Come on.
- Why don't you sing something?

41:08.883 --> 41:11.259
Come on, just one.

41:11.385 --> 41:13.261
Come and have a drink.

41:14.221 --> 41:16.864
- Hey, look what I found.
- Whoo-hoo!

41:19.226 --> 41:21.561
- Hey!
- Whoa!

41:25.107 --> 41:27.442
Hello!

41:28.986 --> 41:30.445
Hey, come on.

41:31.780 --> 41:33.615
Hey.

41:44.585 --> 41:48.963
Hey, come on back!
We didn't mean anything! Honest!

41:49.089 --> 41:52.425
Don't be a spoilsport. At least
give her a head start. Ha-ha!

41:54.011 --> 41:57.305
Man, look at those fangs!
They're better than mine.

42:03.103 --> 42:05.480
That guy's got no sense of humor.

43:21.056 --> 43:23.391
- Please help me!
- Sorry.

43:23.517 --> 43:26.102
That man, he's following me.

43:28.272 --> 43:30.023
Grab her! She's gonna jump!

44:37.132 --> 44:39.550
Come on, honey. The ride's over.

45:06.120 --> 45:07.954
- Tony?
- Hm?

45:08.080 --> 45:10.957
Do you make love to lots of women?

45:11.083 --> 45:14.210
Now, what kind of a question
is that to ask?

45:14.336 --> 45:17.296
I bet you make love to all the women
that pose for your pictures,

45:17.423 --> 45:18.965
don't you?

45:19.091 --> 45:21.759
That's why you never want me
to come to your studio.

45:21.885 --> 45:26.389
You're exactly right.
I keep several there at all times.

45:26.515 --> 45:28.641
I wouldn't be surprised.

45:31.019 --> 45:32.395
Tony?

45:33.480 --> 45:35.440
Why don't you ever...

45:35.566 --> 45:38.276
you know, make a pass at me?

45:40.279 --> 45:41.738
I...

45:41.864 --> 45:44.073
I have too much respect for you.

45:44.199 --> 45:47.827
But I don't want you to respect me,
not that kind.

45:49.037 --> 45:51.080
I want you to love me, really.

45:51.206 --> 45:53.207
But I do. You know that.

45:53.333 --> 45:57.378
I never knew what happiness was
till I saw you. Don't spoil it.

45:57.504 --> 46:00.214
Oh, kiss me, Tony. Kiss me.

46:00.340 --> 46:02.258
Oh, Tony.

46:07.890 --> 46:08.890
Oh!

46:10.851 --> 46:13.894
Tony! Tony!

46:23.280 --> 46:26.032
Please! Tony!

46:28.786 --> 46:32.497
Give me time! You've got to give me time!

49:10.197 --> 49:13.950
Observe. Quantum is not merely decorative.

49:14.076 --> 49:16.661
It has social utility too.

49:19.665 --> 49:22.083
- Dorean! What's the hurry, girl?
- Max!

49:22.209 --> 49:25.294
A man! He's been chasing me
all the way from the beach!

49:28.966 --> 49:31.217
Get him!

49:33.679 --> 49:35.888
Is there somewhere you can go,
where you'll be safe?

49:36.890 --> 49:40.309
- Dorean?
- Yes. I guess so.

49:40.435 --> 49:41.435
Good.

49:41.561 --> 49:44.730
I have a friend who lives in the bell
tower in the old part of the city.

49:44.856 --> 49:46.816
I'll go there.

52:22.889 --> 52:26.100
- Did you see his face?
- Yeah. Why?

52:26.226 --> 52:28.352
I've never seen anything like it before.

52:28.478 --> 52:32.690
- What do you mean?
- He looked just like a vampire.

52:32.816 --> 52:36.318
What are you talking about?
Hey! He's gone!

52:37.362 --> 52:40.865
- I can't believe it.
- I can.

52:40.991 --> 52:44.994
Maybe there was something in that
old legend Donna was reading me.

52:45.120 --> 52:48.205
He was chasing Dorean. Hey, wait a minute!

52:48.331 --> 52:49.456
What?

52:49.583 --> 52:53.794
She said she was going to the old
bell tower. That's where Sordi lives.

52:53.920 --> 52:56.463
What's he got to do with this?
I thought we were chasing that...

52:56.590 --> 52:58.340
that vampire.

52:58.466 --> 53:00.926
Exactly. Come on.

54:45.782 --> 54:47.825
I...

54:48.994 --> 54:52.746
I forgive you for everything,
Melizza. Do you hear?

54:53.665 --> 54:55.833
For everything.

54:57.043 --> 54:59.086
But... but now I need you.

55:00.297 --> 55:02.756
Just once more, I need you.

55:03.883 --> 55:05.884
You must come back to me, Melizza.

55:18.189 --> 55:19.231
Melizza?

57:23.606 --> 57:25.816
You've come back to me,
just like I knew you would.

57:25.942 --> 57:28.277
We shall work together again,
just as before.

57:28.403 --> 57:30.487
We shall create death together.

57:39.330 --> 57:41.832
This is the moment we've both
been waiting for, isn't it?

57:42.750 --> 57:47.254
No more accusations,
no more betrayals, doubts.

57:47.380 --> 57:48.540
It's all forgotten, forgiven,

57:48.631 --> 57:52.134
so that now, at last, we can achieve
together what was always meant to be.

57:52.260 --> 57:56.096
Tonight,
Sordi shall paint again like Sordi.

58:01.102 --> 58:03.187
That's all trash!

58:06.107 --> 58:08.859
Thank God I can still destroy them.

58:10.195 --> 58:14.490
Now no one shall know Sordi
except for the artist Sordi.

58:14.616 --> 58:18.619
This could be the first new work
worthy of his name.

58:22.165 --> 58:24.750
And so a great new era in the hist...

58:26.294 --> 58:28.879
history of art begins.

58:29.005 --> 58:31.507
And you're to be a part of it, Melizza,

58:31.633 --> 58:34.468
an indispensable part.

58:34.594 --> 58:36.386
Think of it, Melizza.

58:36.513 --> 58:40.390
What an honor, to be preserved
forever like the Mona Lisa,

58:40.517 --> 58:45.521
beautiful beyond description,
untouched by time and age.

58:47.398 --> 58:49.399
See?

58:49.526 --> 58:51.568
How clean,

58:51.694 --> 58:53.779
how sharp, how painless.

58:57.033 --> 58:59.660
Just one quick caress.

59:01.454 --> 59:03.455
Then peace,

59:03.581 --> 59:05.624
immortality.

01:00:03.808 --> 01:00:06.393
No.

01:01:27.016 --> 01:01:28.850
Come on now! Come on!

01:01:28.976 --> 01:01:30.644
Daisy!

01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:33.563
- Good Lord!
- No!

01:01:38.277 --> 01:01:40.320
Dorean, what happened?
