TO REMOVE IT,

07:20.527 --> 07:22.920
I'D SPILL MY DRINK ON IT.

07:23.007 --> 07:25.314

OUT OF THE BACK,

IN A SOUVENIR BAG, OR...

A REALLY GOOD SONG...

08:05.397 --> 08:08.096

THE GUARDS.

08:08.183 --> 08:09.706
GOOD EYE, PETER.

08:09.793 --> 08:12.883

OR TOOLS OF ANY KIND.

AND SEE WHERE SHE'S BEEN.

08:28.246 --> 08:29.900
YOU CAN GO JOIN DIANA.

08:29.987 --> 08:31.859
OH. YOU THINK
SHE NEEDS MY HELP?

08:31.946 --> 08:35.471
NO, I JUST DON'T LIKE
YOU WALKING AROUND HERE
WITHOUT A CHAPERONE.

08:41.303 --> 08:43.827
WOW, THAT IS BEAUTIFUL.

08:43.914 --> 08:47.309
CAN YOU GIVE ME A LENGTHY,
DETAILED HISTORY OF THIS PIECE?

08:47.396 --> 08:49.398
WELL,
THIS PARTICULAR ARTIST

08:49.485 --> 08:51.792
WANTED AN EXCUSE
TO STARE AT NAKED WOMEN ALL DAY.

08:51.879 --> 08:53.315
NOW YOU'RE NOT EVEN TRYING.

08:53.402 --> 08:55.056
I DON'T NEED TO TRY.
I WON.

08:55.143 --> 08:58.233
ANY SUSPECTS YET?

08:58.320 --> 09:00.104
9:00.

09:02.498 --> 09:03.630
CUTE.
MM-HMM.

09:06.067 --> 09:07.808
DAMN, SHE MADE ME.

09:07.895 --> 09:09.113
WHAT,
SHE KNOWS YOU'RE FBI?

09:09.200 --> 09:10.245
NOPE.

09:10.332 --> 09:11.681
Then what are you...

09:11.768 --> 09:13.814

ABSOLUTELY STUNNING.

09:13.901 --> 09:15.380
AH...

09:15.467 --> 09:19.384
IT IS...STUNNING...
AND CHALLENGING.

09:19.471 --> 09:21.169
I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT.

09:21.256 --> 09:22.910
IT'S AN INTRIGUING PIECE.

09:22.997 --> 09:24.302
HER COLLAPSING FORM,

09:24.389 --> 09:27.479
THE SHADOW DRAGGING HER DOWN
AS SHE SLOWLY FADES AWAY --

09:27.567 --> 09:30.134
IT INVOKES A HEARTBREAKING SENSE
OF MELANCHOLY.

09:30.221 --> 09:31.353
I DISAGREE.

09:31.440 --> 09:35.357
I FIND IT BOLD,
YET STILL SENSUAL.

09:37.141 --> 09:38.839
I'M ABIGAIL.

09:38.926 --> 09:40.754
DIANA.

09:40.841 --> 09:43.234
DO YOU COME HERE OFTEN?

09:43.321 --> 09:45.019
TO THE MUSEUM, I MEAN.

09:45.106 --> 09:46.368
I DON'T.

09:46.455 --> 09:49.806
BUT I THINK
I NEED TO START.

09:51.939 --> 09:54.463
DO WE HAVE EYES
ON OUR SUSPECT?

09:54.550 --> 09:57.553
YES, WE DO.
AND SHE HAS EYES ON DIANA.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.773
IS SHE GETTING
DIANA'S PHONE NUMBER?

09:59.860 --> 10:02.079
WHO WOULD STOP IN THE MIDDLE
OF A MUSEUM ROBBERY

10:02.166 --> 10:03.167
TO GET A DATE?

10:03.254 --> 10:04.604
C--
DON'T SAY IT.

10:12.176 --> 10:14.439
DON'T BOTHER.

10:14.526 --> 10:16.093
EXCUSE ME?

10:16.180 --> 10:19.401
YOU CAN STOP WORKING THE DOCENT.
YOU'RE NOT HER TYPE.

10:19.488 --> 10:21.621
I THINK
YOU GOT THE WRONG IDEA.

10:21.708 --> 10:22.970
OH. OH, I'M SORRY.
