one more time.

- Where did Billy get that drug?
- I said I don't know.

11:44.437 --> 11:47.031
Caitlin, when your dad said
that you're 16

11:47.206 --> 11:49.640
and you could be home alone now
because you're a big girl,

11:49.809 --> 11:52.141
well, that also means
that we can charge you as an adult.

11:52.344 --> 11:54.039

- No, nothing like that.

11:57.016 --> 11:59.814
But when we cuff her and bring her
down to Central Booking...

12:00.019 --> 12:03.011
- Oh, this is outrageous.
DANNY: No, it's the law, sir, okay?

12:03.189 --> 12:05.157

could be charged

12:05.324 --> 12:07.224

of an illegal substance.

- Who? I need a name.

I think they buy it at school.

I don't do drugs.

we'd love to talk to the students,

13:49.628 --> 13:51.619
but we can't do it
without the parents' permission

13:51.797 --> 13:55.528

so we simply don't have the time.

13:55.701 --> 13:59.193

Please understand, commissioner,

those lockers has ramifications.

than seeing that more kids don't die?

of their children.

15:46.045 --> 15:47.910

at St. Angelus.

It was a lethal dose
of potassium chloride.

23:54.099 --> 23:55.589
I'm not really a science geek.

23:55.801 --> 24:00.101
It's a common chemical
used in fertilizers and water softeners.

24:00.272 --> 24:02.263
It's not used in recreational drugs.

24:02.741 --> 24:04.299
And they also use
on death row inmates

Yeah, and that's the worse news.
It's not Carvell.

24:24.496 --> 24:27.329
The lab tested the M-Cat
that came from Carvell's shop

24:27.566 --> 24:30.330
and tested the M-Cat
from Wayne Foster's sample,

24:30.502 --> 24:33.300
it was heroin,
methedrone and baby laxative.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.201
Neither one had potassium chloride.

24:36.408 --> 24:39.468
Great, Carvell told the truth.

24:39.644 --> 24:42.579
All right, so we got one packet
of M-Cat with potassium chloride.

24:42.747 --> 24:44.942
If Carvell didn't put it in there,
who did?

24:45.150 --> 24:48.449
The only thing I'm thinking is maybe
Billy wanted a bigger high and put it in.

33:43.287 --> 33:44.447
Yeah.

33:44.622 --> 33:48.319
Did you know that your grandma,
her mom,

33:48.493 --> 33:51.121
was president of the same charity
before she died?

33:53.064 --> 33:57.023
Maybe your mom
was thinking about her, missing her.

33:59.871 --> 34:01.805
You were thinking about her too?

34:07.178 --> 34:08.735
I was.

34:08.913 --> 34:10.972
But I was trying to be strong
for your mom.

34:13.851 --> 34:17.981
Just like you need your mom,
your mom needs you.

34:18.723 --> 34:23.319
To look out for her,
to understand her, and love her.

- Good morning.
- Oh, come here, check this out.

34:43.214 --> 34:47.446
This Twitter thing, it not only records
the times of your tweets,

34:47.618 --> 34:49.848
but it tracks your location
with a GPS.

34:50.021 --> 34:52.284
Look at this. I had our tech guys
put her coordinates

34:52.456 --> 34:54.186
into our mapping system.

- I know.
- "6:12 p.m., Fro-yo for dinner." Okay.

35:09.974 --> 35:13.466
Okay, so her last tweet
was at Prince and Broadway

35:13.644 --> 35:16.807
and it's at the exact same time
that Alyson Duvitz

35:16.981 --> 35:18.642
was hit with the car, miles away.

35:18.883 --> 35:21.716
Assuming it was Caitlin
that was sending the tweets,

35:21.886 --> 35:23.353

35:23.955 --> 35:26.219
What about that secret lover
Caitlin was talking about?

35:26.757 --> 35:28.156
If she even exists.

35:28.392 --> 35:31.054
Is it worth going back to school
one more time and taking a look?

35:31.229 --> 35:34.460
Well, whoever it was,
they tried to kill Alyson Duvitz twice.

35:34.632 --> 35:36.463

Parents are calling,

35:50.982 --> 35:53.007
Well, you can tell
the concerned parents

35:53.184 --> 35:56.153
we're investigating a triple homicide
at their children's school.

Yeah, in fact,
we're looking for a dark sedan.

a St. Angelus bumper sticker
on their car?

for a dollar in the supply room.

A dark sedan.

- No bumper sticker, though.
- Well, that's just it.

36:30.221 --> 36:33.349
Looks like somebody removed a sticker
here and ran this car through a wash.

36:33.524 --> 36:36.015
Yeah, like a hit-and-run
trying to cover his tracks.

- Yeah, Curatola.

What could you tell us
about Vice Principal Hoffman?

37:03.487 --> 37:05.921
The students love her.
I get no complaints.

37:06.090 --> 37:08.923
Despite the fact that as vice principal,
she's often called upon

37:09.093 --> 37:11.721
to mete out discipline
and resolve disputes.

37:11.896 --> 37:14.956
Did she ever have any
disciplinary issues with Billy Romero?

37:15.166 --> 37:17.691
- Not that I'm aware of.
- lnteractions we should know about?

37:17.902 --> 37:20.564
Well, he can thank her
for not flunking out sophomore year.

- How so?
- He was failing Science.

37:22.740 --> 37:24.674
- She tutored him.
- Tutored him in Science?

before I promoted her.

Thanks for, uh, letting us take another
look, Miss Hoffman. We appreciate it.

I could be more help if I knew
what you were looking for.

Well, actually, uh,
we're not looking for anything.

37:43.394 --> 37:45.055

a few questions.

37:45.229 --> 37:46.457
Why don't you have a seat?

I really should be getting back
to my office.

Oh, it won't take long.

So Father Leo says
that, uh, you taught Chemistry here.

Before I became vice principal.

to your average students?

You see, it was you who tried
to run down Alyson Duvitz with a car,

38:35.179 --> 38:36.510
and it was you who planted
the potassium chloride

thinking it would throw us off.

- What was it? Hmm?

You couldn't find somebody
your own age to have sex with

I know, I know.
You're needy, right?

38:51.162 --> 38:53.153
Is that your problem? You're clingy?

He was so disgusted with himself
that he had to take drugs

38:56.500 --> 38:59.765
just to have sex with you, is that it?

39:01.138 --> 39:06.576
He loved me, and I loved him.

39:06.777 --> 39:09.109
He didn't love you, okay?

39:09.280 --> 39:11.339
The fact is that he couldn't stand
the sight of you

and he wanted to get as far away
from you as possible.

39:14.118 --> 39:17.451

I begged him not to leave me.

he was making a big mistake.

then no one could?

39:26.397 --> 39:28.297
He wouldn't talk to me.

girlfriend a going-away present, hmm?

and get the other two kids by chance?

You don't know what it's like
to have somebody

of Alyson Duvitz.

for a time that never existed?

- Yeah.

He's agreed
to let me hold a press conference.

41:12.403 --> 41:15.566
No more sweeping things
under the rug.

41:16.841 --> 41:19.571
You may need divine intervention.

41:19.743 --> 41:24.146
The press will be more interested
in creating heat than shedding light.

41:25.115 --> 41:28.949
If you'll have me,
I would like to stand with you, Father,

than I thought it was gonna be.

Yeah, dipping the slices in the egg
and getting all the flour to stick,
