<i>Nine years ago,</i>
<i>I witnessed my mother's murder.</i>

00:04.228 --> 00:06.810
I would have been killed, too,
<i>if it hadn't been for Vincent.</i>

00:06.910 --> 00:09.794
<i>I was part of an experimental</i>
<i>special forces group.</i>

00:09.796 --> 00:12.147
<i>Their goal was to create</i>
<i>the perfect super soldier.</i>

00:12.149 --> 00:14.216
<i>But something went wrong.</i>

00:14.218 --> 00:15.584
You're him.

00:15.586 --> 00:17.135
<i>Muirfield is still out there,</i>

00:17.137 --> 00:18.153
and they want me dead.

00:18.155 --> 00:19.304
I am scared for you.

00:19.306 --> 00:20.439
You don't have to be.

00:20.441 --> 00:21.440
If you're not gonna

00:21.442 --> 00:22.524
protect yourself, I will.

00:22.526 --> 00:24.659
I'm Dr. Sorenson.
You would be

00:24.661 --> 00:27.162
an asset to our
organization.

00:27.164 --> 00:29.114
I'd like you to meet my brother.
This is Darius.

00:29.116 --> 00:30.815
- Dinner?
<i>- Darius?</i>

00:33.586 --> 00:36.004
You brought her in. It's
your finger on the trigger.

00:39.375 --> 00:40.842
<i>I killed him.</i>

00:40.844 --> 00:43.161
Who? Darius.

00:43.163 --> 00:45.063
Well, I'm standing here
waiting to hear

00:45.065 --> 00:46.715
the amazing reason you're
destroying evidence.

00:46.717 --> 00:48.350
I'll put in for a new partner
in the morning.

00:48.352 --> 00:50.635
I want for you
to have what you want.

00:50.637 --> 00:53.605
What I want
is to be with you.

00:53.607 --> 00:55.357
I love you.

01:52.366 --> 01:54.783
Just wait a sec.

01:54.785 --> 01:57.118
It'll pass.

01:57.120 --> 02:00.238
Vincent, it's me.

02:00.240 --> 02:02.290
Just calm down.

02:17.256 --> 02:18.690
Vincent, just breathe.

02:19.392 --> 02:21.309

02:36.460 --> 02:39.494
Vincent.

Vincent, please.

02:41.114 --> 02:42.797
Please.

02:42.799 --> 02:45.884
Vincent.

03:01.267 --> 03:03.234
Vincent, you awake?

03:03.236 --> 03:05.020
Hey, yeah.

03:05.022 --> 03:06.471
Hey.

03:06.473 --> 03:07.822
Look who got
her own house key.

03:07.824 --> 03:09.491
Who knew?

03:12.278 --> 03:14.012
Uh, what's going on?

03:14.014 --> 03:16.247
Not much.
Just in the neighborhood.

03:16.249 --> 03:18.116
You're seriously
going with that?

03:18.118 --> 03:21.753
I thought that maybe
the two of us could hang out.

03:21.755 --> 03:25.373
If you're not
doing anything.

03:25.375 --> 03:26.791
Right now?

03:26.793 --> 03:28.843
Yeah.

03:28.845 --> 03:30.378
He's not

03:30.380 --> 03:31.379
doing anything.

03:31.381 --> 03:32.514
Right, V?

03:32.516 --> 03:34.165
In the day.

03:34.167 --> 03:36.134
I mean, you're like
Mr. Nocturnal Guy, right?

03:36.136 --> 03:37.519
I have class, anyway.

03:37.521 --> 03:39.187
Let me just
grab my things.

03:39.189 --> 03:41.606
Probably won't be back
for several hours.

03:52.735 --> 03:54.686
Uh, I'll just put
a shirt on.

03:54.688 --> 03:56.688
Okay.

03:56.690 --> 03:58.373
Yeah, of course.

03:58.375 --> 04:00.191
I was just thinking
about that.

04:00.193 --> 04:01.826
Not-not about that.

04:01.828 --> 04:03.828
Um, just...

04:03.830 --> 04:05.497
about the kiss.

04:05.499 --> 04:06.498
I just...

04:06.500 --> 04:07.999
Hey, you know what?

04:08.001 --> 04:09.501
I-I actually have got
to get going, so...

04:09.503 --> 04:11.086
Right now?

04:11.088 --> 04:12.504
Yeah.

04:13.756 --> 04:16.757
What are you, like,
running errands these days?

04:18.095 --> 04:19.711
Grocery shopping?

04:21.647 --> 04:24.099
Okay, I just...

04:24.101 --> 04:26.234
I thought that we, um...

04:26.236 --> 04:28.553
After the other night...

04:28.555 --> 04:30.488
Don't you...

04:30.490 --> 04:32.440
Yeah, I do.

04:33.410 --> 04:35.243
Believe me, I do want that.

04:35.245 --> 04:36.578
Clearly.

04:36.580 --> 04:39.581
The way you are trying to race
out of here.

04:39.583 --> 04:41.833
Come on, I'm
not racing out.

04:44.003 --> 04:46.337
Vincent, is this about
what happened with Darius?

04:46.339 --> 04:49.073
Because you didn't
have a choice.

04:49.075 --> 04:51.626
I want you to know that if
you didn't act when you did,

04:51.628 --> 04:53.712
Heather would be dead.

04:53.714 --> 04:55.547
Yes, thank you.

04:55.549 --> 04:57.298
Uh, I will see you later, okay?

04:57.300 --> 04:58.616
I promise.

05:14.536 --> 05:15.869
This is very interesting.

05:16.474 --> 05:18.591
I had no idea the creature
was mutating so quickly.

05:18.593 --> 05:21.010
You have our phone number.

05:21.012 --> 05:22.732
You think of anything else,
you let us know.

05:22.959 --> 05:24.425
That's it?

05:24.427 --> 05:26.344
I gave my research to Muirfield

05:26.346 --> 05:28.713
because h-he promised me
a position.

05:28.715 --> 05:30.932
He said that we would find the
cross-species creature together.

05:30.934 --> 05:32.633
I don't care what
deal he offered you.

05:32.635 --> 05:34.719
He doesn't
make that call.

05:34.721 --> 05:36.020
I can do more than just

05:36.022 --> 05:38.055
pass off thumb drives
and autopsy reports.

05:38.057 --> 05:39.223
I-I don't understand.

05:39.225 --> 05:41.342
W-Why is this so
important to you?

05:41.344 --> 05:44.345
It almost
seems personal.

05:44.347 --> 05:48.115
Maybe I just don't want to see
anybody else get hurt.

05:48.117 --> 05:49.901
That's noble.

05:49.903 --> 05:52.987
But noble isn't
the same as useful.

05:52.989 --> 05:54.739
You're not
Muirfield material.

05:54.741 --> 05:57.691
Says the man who was
just gaping at my research.

05:57.693 --> 06:00.161
Careful, Dr. Marks.

06:00.163 --> 06:02.863
Look, you-you are desperate.

06:02.865 --> 06:04.165
You need me.

06:04.167 --> 06:05.383
I'm desperate?

06:05.385 --> 06:07.218
Look at you.

06:07.220 --> 06:10.588
You're nervous, you're
breathing quick,

06:10.590 --> 06:13.207
you're wiping your sweaty
palms on your pants,

06:13.209 --> 06:15.259
and at one point,

06:15.261 --> 06:17.261
I'm pretty sure
you stuttered.

06:17.263 --> 06:20.481
To the trained eye,
you are a nervous wreck.

06:28.274 --> 06:30.107
Time for you to leave,
Dr. Marks.

06:30.109 --> 06:32.059
Unless you want
to go feet first.

06:33.779 --> 06:35.913
<i>Is this about the mystery guy</i>
<i>at your dad's wedding?</i>

06:35.915 --> 06:38.232
<i>I don't know, Brooke,</i>
<i>I just thought</i>

06:38.234 --> 06:39.733
that we were finally ready

06:39.735 --> 06:41.369
to move forward
in our relationship.

06:41.371 --> 06:43.921
Oh, my gosh, have
you two not gotten freaky yet?

06:43.923 --> 06:45.339
It is not about that.

06:45.341 --> 06:46.791
It's been months.

06:46.793 --> 06:48.593
It's more complicated

06:48.595 --> 06:50.077
than me stripping down naked
and saying,

06:50.079 --> 06:51.879
"Do me, do me now."

06:51.881 --> 06:53.580
Can I take
a shower first?

06:55.801 --> 06:57.935
Uh, I-I got to go.

06:57.937 --> 06:59.186
Okay.

06:59.188 --> 07:01.772
N-Not to worry,

07:01.774 --> 07:03.941
but you should know you are
in the wrong locker room.

07:03.943 --> 07:06.477
You sure about that?

07:11.283 --> 07:13.234
Uh, okay.

07:14.953 --> 07:17.238
Yeah.

07:17.240 --> 07:18.823
Just for the record,

07:18.825 --> 07:21.826
anyone who passes on the chance
to get naked with you

07:21.828 --> 07:23.411
is out of his mind.

07:30.618 --> 07:32.386
Dry cappuccino,
double shot.

07:32.388 --> 07:33.620
Cat...

07:33.622 --> 07:35.056
Yes, I realize
this coffee

07:35.058 --> 07:36.724
is not gonna fix our
entire partnership.

07:36.726 --> 07:39.977
I just need two minutes
of girl time to vent.

07:39.979 --> 07:43.180
You don't even have
to say anything.

07:43.182 --> 07:44.815
Okay, I'm at the gym.

07:44.817 --> 07:46.800
I just...

07:46.802 --> 07:49.854
I needed to work out
some frustration.

07:49.856 --> 07:52.156
Yes, because
of Vincent,

07:52.158 --> 07:55.109
who I know that you're
not a big fan of.

07:55.111 --> 07:57.328
But, um, I don't know,

07:57.330 --> 08:02.083
I thought that we were taking
things to the next level,

08:02.085 --> 08:04.502
but instead, he--

08:04.504 --> 08:07.621
You know the, you know
the trophy with the hand?

08:07.623 --> 08:09.540
The Heisman?

08:09.542 --> 08:10.958
Yes.

08:14.629 --> 08:16.881
This is making me feel
better already, thank you.

08:16.883 --> 08:18.182
That's what I'm here for.

08:18.184 --> 08:20.167
At least, that's what
I used to be here for.

08:21.970 --> 08:23.304
Okay, but it gets worse.

08:23.306 --> 08:26.023
So, then I go
into the showers,

08:26.025 --> 08:28.693
and I run into
half-naked guy.

08:28.695 --> 08:30.227
As if I needed
any more reminding

08:30.229 --> 08:32.145
that my love life is in rewind
and that the "mystery ma""

08:32.148 --> 08:34.847
would rather go grocery shopping...

08:34.850 --> 08:35.982
Ladies.

08:35.985 --> 08:37.851
I was just telling our new

08:37.852 --> 08:39.320
district attorney here
how professional you were.

08:39.322 --> 08:40.854
Highest clearance rate
in the city.

08:40.856 --> 08:42.073
You mention that?

08:42.075 --> 08:43.190
He did.

08:43.192 --> 08:45.159
Gabe Lowan.
Detective Vargas.

08:45.161 --> 08:46.577
And this is my--

08:46.579 --> 08:48.379
This is
Detective Chandler.

08:48.381 --> 08:50.164
It's very nice to meet you.

08:50.166 --> 08:52.666
Yes, same.

08:52.668 --> 08:54.885
Lieutenant, shall we?

08:54.887 --> 08:57.338
I'll show you
to your office.

08:57.340 --> 08:59.340
Detectives.

09:01.977 --> 09:04.261
Office?

09:04.263 --> 09:06.981
What's the new A.D.A. doing
setting up shop here?

09:06.983 --> 09:09.567
The vigilante's
been stacking up bodies.

09:09.569 --> 09:11.352
And the rumor is
Lowan's investigating Joe

09:11.354 --> 09:15.322
for not putting more resources
into catching him sooner.

09:15.324 --> 09:16.991
That's why
he brought on those guys.

09:16.993 --> 09:18.359
Yeah.

09:18.361 --> 09:19.726
Great to have you here.

09:19.728 --> 09:21.112
Who are they?

09:21.114 --> 09:22.997
Garnett and Newell.

09:22.999 --> 09:25.583
On indefinite loan
to Special Crimes.

09:25.585 --> 09:27.868
They're here to help
catch the vigilante.

09:27.870 --> 09:29.903
Maybe find the missing
assailant in Darius's murder,

09:29.905 --> 09:32.790
finally get a witness
to I.D. this bastard.

09:32.792 --> 09:34.959
Okay, so Joe's hired assassins.

09:34.961 --> 09:36.010
No.

09:36.012 --> 09:37.178
He brought in guys

09:37.180 --> 09:38.712
to help put away
a dangerous psycho.

09:38.714 --> 09:41.132
Sometimes you need a little
"shoot first,

09:41.134 --> 09:43.684
ask questions later."

09:43.686 --> 09:45.970
Vargas, A.D.A.
needs to speak with you.

09:45.972 --> 09:48.522
Upstairs in the
conference room. Hustle.

09:54.029 --> 09:55.713
So how's Joe doing?

09:55.715 --> 09:58.332
Just curious.

09:58.334 --> 10:01.368
I'd say extremely well,
given the circumstances.

10:01.370 --> 10:03.120
Right, but it's got
to be hard.

10:03.122 --> 10:05.206
A case like this
hits so close to home.

10:05.208 --> 10:08.742
Is this a social call
or official business?

10:08.744 --> 10:10.127
'Cause I've got
a murderer to catch.

10:10.129 --> 10:11.745
You sound defensive.

10:11.747 --> 10:12.830
Defensive? Please.

10:12.832 --> 10:13.881
Try insulted.

10:13.883 --> 10:15.299
The whole
friendly facade,

10:15.301 --> 10:16.950
like I've never conducted
an interrogation.

10:16.952 --> 10:19.086
If you're asking
if Joe's up to the task

10:19.088 --> 10:22.089
of catching the vigilante,
the answer is yes, he is.

10:22.091 --> 10:24.341
Fair enough.

10:24.343 --> 10:27.094
But it's not just Joe
I'm looking into.

10:27.096 --> 10:29.647
It's the entire
Special Crimes Unit.

10:29.649 --> 10:32.650
I prosecute cases based on
evidence your team provides.

10:32.652 --> 10:35.219
I'm concerned that process
is being compromised.

10:35.221 --> 10:38.138
Now, I see
in your file that

10:38.140 --> 10:41.775
you recently requested
a partner transfer.

10:41.777 --> 10:45.696
So what did
Detective Chandler do

10:45.698 --> 10:47.932
to ruin the partnership?

10:51.286 --> 10:53.153
Nothing. Cat's great.

10:53.155 --> 10:54.788
It was just time for a change.

10:54.790 --> 10:57.107
"Change." Really?

11:00.328 --> 11:02.329
Right after
evidence was tampered with

11:02.331 --> 11:05.933
in a questionable suicide case
you two handled.

11:05.935 --> 11:07.885
I've combed through
every one of your cases.

11:07.887 --> 11:12.006
A page was torn out of
a dead reporter's notebook.

11:12.008 --> 11:13.674
Last chance.
Is there anything

11:13.676 --> 11:16.343
that you want to tell me
about Detective Chandler?

11:28.990 --> 11:32.025
So...

11:32.027 --> 11:33.360
how'd it go?

11:33.362 --> 11:34.879
Uh, it didn't.

11:34.881 --> 11:36.297
What?

11:36.299 --> 11:38.215
I just spent three hours
in my office

11:38.217 --> 11:39.800
throwing pencils at the ceiling.

11:39.802 --> 11:41.886
Even I get laid
by the 23rd date.

11:41.888 --> 11:43.220
Come on, man.

11:43.222 --> 11:46.006
You know it's not like that.

11:46.008 --> 11:47.808
I just... I don't know.

11:47.810 --> 11:49.343
I guess...

11:51.212 --> 11:53.213
I'm afraid, you know?

11:53.215 --> 11:56.100
That was years ago. You're...

11:56.102 --> 11:57.985
You can handle things

11:57.987 --> 11:59.436
better now.

12:01.106 --> 12:03.223
Hey, there.

12:03.225 --> 12:05.058
I was just leaving.

12:05.060 --> 12:06.360
Again.

12:06.362 --> 12:08.996
With more pencils.

12:14.402 --> 12:17.070
Vincent, I'm... I'm afraid.

12:17.072 --> 12:18.372
Things, they're
getting out of hand.

12:18.374 --> 12:20.073
I know, and I need to explain.

12:20.075 --> 12:22.092
No. Joe, he...

12:22.094 --> 12:25.179
he brought in these two
trigger-happy cops.

12:26.748 --> 12:29.082
To hunt you.

12:31.353 --> 12:33.354
I'm sorry.

12:40.895 --> 12:43.864
I always knew that I would take
a bullet for what I was.

12:43.866 --> 12:45.950
I just... I always thought

12:45.952 --> 12:48.235
Muirfield would be the ones
pulling the trigger.

12:48.237 --> 12:50.321
What, you just
accepted that?

12:50.323 --> 12:54.241
Having them hunt me is
the easier part to live with.

12:54.243 --> 12:56.744
And what part of getting shot
can't you live with?

12:56.746 --> 12:58.078
Oh, you haven't seen?

12:58.080 --> 13:01.081
Uh, what they say about me
in the papers,

13:01.083 --> 13:02.949
that I'm a cold-blooded killer,

13:02.951 --> 13:04.218
that I will hunt
innocent people.

13:04.220 --> 13:05.753
They're looking for
the assailant

13:05.755 --> 13:07.388
that got away
before you killed Darius,

13:07.390 --> 13:08.756
the one that ordered

13:08.758 --> 13:10.341
the hit on Heather.

13:10.343 --> 13:12.092
If we can find him,
maybe we can...

13:12.094 --> 13:13.627
What, convince him

13:13.629 --> 13:15.346
to say that
the police chief's brother

13:15.348 --> 13:16.981
wasn't some stand-up kid?

13:16.983 --> 13:19.566
That he deserved to have
his neck snapped in two?

13:19.568 --> 13:21.685
No, he can testify
that you were just trying

13:21.687 --> 13:23.303
to protect my sister.

13:25.323 --> 13:27.024
Vincent, we're running out
of time.

13:27.026 --> 13:28.776
I convinced Tess to talk to Joe.

13:28.778 --> 13:30.244
You know, maybe they
should just lock me up.

13:30.246 --> 13:32.696
Every time I try
and save someone,

13:32.698 --> 13:35.666
I end up killing
someone instead.

13:35.668 --> 13:37.835
You know, public
enemy number one.

13:37.837 --> 13:40.504
Okay, we are going
to get through this.

13:43.758 --> 13:47.711
Vincent, I am trying
to help you.

13:47.713 --> 13:51.298
You keep pulling back
because of what, some headline?

13:51.300 --> 13:55.936
No, I keep pulling back because
I don't want to hurt you.

14:00.141 --> 14:03.110
This will sound strange,
but I had this dream.

14:04.896 --> 14:06.780
We were starting up,

14:06.782 --> 14:07.898
and it was good.

14:07.900 --> 14:09.950
It was, it was great.

14:09.952 --> 14:13.019
But I began to change,
and, uh...

14:13.021 --> 14:15.856
It was, it was a nightmare.

14:15.858 --> 14:17.074
No.

14:17.076 --> 14:20.160
'Cause nightmares
you wake up from.

14:27.201 --> 14:30.921
Okay, two years ago...

14:30.923 --> 14:34.141
I was with a woman.

14:35.727 --> 14:38.929
And, uh, we were
getting close,

14:38.931 --> 14:40.881
and my adrenaline
kicked in.

14:40.883 --> 14:45.102
I tried to fight it,
I did, but...

14:45.104 --> 14:47.855
I couldn't stop from changing.

14:47.857 --> 14:50.023
Okay.

14:53.111 --> 14:55.729
Um...

14:55.731 --> 14:57.247
What happened?

14:57.249 --> 14:59.199
Did you...

14:59.201 --> 15:02.419
Did you kill her?

15:04.071 --> 15:06.039
No.

15:09.377 --> 15:12.513
But only because she got away.

15:15.133 --> 15:19.603
Vincent, you... you have always

15:19.605 --> 15:22.255
been able to control yourself
with me.

15:22.257 --> 15:25.225
Then I've been putting up
a good front.

15:27.061 --> 15:29.229
The truth is,

15:29.231 --> 15:32.699
I've never felt
so out of control

15:32.701 --> 15:35.435
than when I do
when I'm with you.

15:44.781 --> 15:47.367
<i>Deejays, lighting</i>
<i>systems, top-shelf liquor.</i>

15:47.467 --> 15:48.843
Doesn't sound
like my kind of party.

15:48.844 --> 15:50.260
It was Darius's kind.

15:50.262 --> 15:52.562
Three months ago, he
opened a VIP lounge

15:52.564 --> 15:54.765
with 100 grand of operating
cash from an unknown source.

15:54.984 --> 15:56.817
The club never
turned a profit.

15:56.819 --> 15:58.853
Which makes it hard
to pay off debt.

15:58.855 --> 16:00.654
Yeah, and it
isn't good

16:00.656 --> 16:03.390
if the loan shark you
owe is Gregory Cole.

16:03.392 --> 16:06.226
He's the guy found
dead with Darius.

16:06.228 --> 16:08.729
He's a known associate of the
East River Crime Syndicate.

16:08.731 --> 16:10.781
You mean the guy I killed.
Vincent...

16:10.783 --> 16:12.750
Sorry, one of the guys
that I killed.

16:12.752 --> 16:14.351
Okay, which saved
Heather's life.

16:14.703 --> 16:16.753
If we find the guy
who fled the scene,

16:16.755 --> 16:18.472
we find the guy
who can prove

16:18.474 --> 16:21.124
that you are a hero.

16:25.813 --> 16:27.331
I'm sorry.

16:27.333 --> 16:29.983
Uh, no, I get it.

16:29.985 --> 16:32.269
Probably should have
told you, uh,

16:32.271 --> 16:33.987
before things got this far.

16:34.989 --> 16:37.957
I just, I didn't know how,
you know?

16:37.959 --> 16:40.776
I just couldn't
handle the fact

16:40.778 --> 16:42.495
that you might pull away,

16:42.497 --> 16:45.548
or you might hate me as much
as I hate myself right now.

16:45.550 --> 16:48.718
How could I ever hate you?

16:48.720 --> 16:51.554
It would be like hating
a part of myself.

17:01.682 --> 17:04.633
So what do we do?

17:04.635 --> 17:07.486
'Cause believe me,
it's not like I don't want to.

17:07.488 --> 17:09.188
Preaching to the choir.

17:10.525 --> 17:12.141
Until we figure this out,

17:12.143 --> 17:15.810
maybe we just need to
keep our hands to ourselves.

17:17.531 --> 17:19.832
Check out this guy.

17:19.834 --> 17:21.584
His name's Curtis Roth.

17:21.586 --> 17:23.618
He's a mid-level money
guy in the syndicate.

17:23.621 --> 17:24.819
Was he the one who...?

17:24.821 --> 17:27.256
Put the screws
to Darius that night? No.

17:27.258 --> 17:28.824
Okay, well,
I'm sure he knows who did.

17:28.826 --> 17:29.875
These guys all talk.

17:29.877 --> 17:31.377
He's got a bar in Tribeca.

17:31.379 --> 17:33.346
Okay, so, what,
you bring him in now?

17:33.348 --> 17:35.514
If Joe finds out that
I'm trying to prove

17:35.516 --> 17:38.634
the vigilante innocent, he's
gonna kick me off the unit.

17:38.636 --> 17:40.186
But if I go in there

17:40.188 --> 17:42.221
and quietly ask
some questions...

17:42.223 --> 17:45.441
No. They'll know you're a cop,
and these guys are dangerous.

17:45.443 --> 17:48.010
<i>I'll do it.</i>

17:49.780 --> 17:51.731
No. I've done
this before.

17:51.733 --> 17:53.182
So have I.

17:55.518 --> 17:58.955
<i>Let's just leave it at</i>
<i>I know how they operate, okay?</i>

17:58.957 --> 18:03.492
<i>I don't want you risking</i>

18:03.494 --> 18:07.830
Now, is there anything in here
<i>about Curtis's associates?</i>

18:07.832 --> 18:10.916
He was arrested in April
with this guy Stocky Green.

18:12.836 --> 18:16.205
Heard you're the guy
to see about a loan.

18:16.207 --> 18:17.974
Straight up, I need 80 grand.

18:19.710 --> 18:23.429
There's an ATM
around the corner.

18:23.431 --> 18:25.765
Yeah, you see, uh...

18:25.767 --> 18:27.650
Stocky sent me.

18:34.241 --> 18:36.258
Doesn't mean I know you.

18:36.260 --> 18:38.661
May I?

18:41.581 --> 18:44.867
I'm out of the service now,
but I got myself

18:44.869 --> 18:46.585
in a little bit
of debt overseas,

18:46.587 --> 18:48.954
and I got to make it right,
and fast.

18:48.956 --> 18:51.407
Now, the thing is,
I'd rather deal with guys

18:51.409 --> 18:53.709
that would break my knees
before they broke my neck,

18:53.711 --> 18:54.994
if you know what I mean.

18:54.996 --> 18:56.746
Plus, I got collateral.

18:56.748 --> 18:58.514
I can get my hands
on M4s,

18:58.516 --> 19:00.933
M14s, XM25s--

19:00.935 --> 19:02.584
all untraceable.

19:02.586 --> 19:04.520
I need to run it by my boss.

19:04.522 --> 19:06.272
Call your boss.
You got 24 hours.

19:06.274 --> 19:10.393
Otherwise, I got to go
someplace else.

19:26.276 --> 19:27.525
Hey.

19:27.527 --> 19:30.352
I got a big order here.
Let me talk to Ray.

19:30.353 --> 19:31.803
Ray Sheckman.

19:31.805 --> 19:33.488
You really
think that this

19:33.490 --> 19:35.223
well-known portfolio manager
is our missing assailant?

19:35.225 --> 19:37.725
He's been investigated
twice for loan sharking,

19:37.727 --> 19:39.861
both in cases connected to
the East River Crime Syndicate,

19:39.863 --> 19:41.729
but no arrests.

19:41.731 --> 19:43.898
I was hoping that you'd found
some evidence

19:43.900 --> 19:45.700
linking him to Darius's murder.

19:45.702 --> 19:46.668
In all of those?

19:46.670 --> 19:49.621
Not even close.

19:49.623 --> 19:51.489
Those are all from
the crime scene?

19:51.491 --> 19:53.708
Minus the six boxes
I've already been through.

19:53.710 --> 19:55.860
But if you want
to get your man,

19:55.862 --> 19:57.629
you better find
some other evidence, fast.

19:57.631 --> 20:00.331
What do you mean?
Garnett and Newell were just here.

20:00.333 --> 20:02.467
Your boy Sheckman is on
their list of possible suspects

20:02.469 --> 20:04.335
that they've also linked
to the syndicate.

20:04.337 --> 20:05.586
They're trying to get warrants.

20:05.588 --> 20:07.388
Even for Sheckman?

20:07.390 --> 20:09.324
I don't think they've got enough
to present to a judge,

20:09.326 --> 20:11.643
but I wouldn't put it past them
to fabricate evidence.

20:11.645 --> 20:13.845
How'd you get onto him?

20:13.847 --> 20:16.347
Ah, just a hunch.

20:16.349 --> 20:17.515
A hunch?

20:18.767 --> 20:20.652
If you're right,

20:20.654 --> 20:23.237
Ray Sheckman
might be the only person

20:23.239 --> 20:25.222
who's ever seen
this vigilante's face.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.224
He could be the key
to this whole investigation.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.493
Then I better hurry.

20:28.495 --> 20:29.827
Wouldn't want to lose a collar

20:29.829 --> 20:32.447
to the new meatheads
on the block.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.758
Dr. Marks. This better be good.

20:43.760 --> 20:45.460
It's better than good.

20:45.462 --> 20:46.961
I've got a witness.

20:46.963 --> 20:49.714
And he's seen our cross-
species creature up close.

20:49.716 --> 20:52.583
If I can find him
and learn what he saw,

20:52.585 --> 20:54.886
would you be willing to expand
our working arrangement?

20:54.888 --> 20:56.688
Give me a name.

20:56.690 --> 20:57.889
If he's as big of a threat

20:57.891 --> 20:59.474
as you say he is,
we can discuss it.

20:59.476 --> 21:01.442
Right. Don't call me,
I'll call you.

21:01.444 --> 21:05.446
No, I'll take care of this
myself, and then we'll talk.

21:19.495 --> 21:21.946
So how's your little
investigation coming along?

21:21.948 --> 21:24.632
Is this your way of telling me
you're not worried?

21:24.634 --> 21:26.884
And seeing what
I'm up against.

21:26.886 --> 21:28.252
It's going fine.

21:28.254 --> 21:30.788
And it's just
an informal appraisal,

21:30.790 --> 21:32.890
it's not a witch hunt.

21:32.892 --> 21:37.645
So when do I get pulled into
one of your "appraisals"?

21:37.647 --> 21:41.298
Tell you the truth,
I'm kind of avoiding you.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.300
Look, I know you must have
done something major

21:43.302 --> 21:44.736
to end things with Tess.

21:44.738 --> 21:46.971
No one walks away from the
number of collars you two had.

21:46.973 --> 21:48.806
Flattery?

21:48.808 --> 21:51.943
Is that supposed to lure me into
a false confession? 'Cause...

21:51.945 --> 21:55.246
But I also know that you believe
in getting justice,

21:55.248 --> 21:57.565
even if it means
crossing some lines.

21:57.567 --> 21:59.867
You obviously feel
some kind of greater purpose.

21:59.869 --> 22:01.869
We are not on
the same side.

22:01.871 --> 22:03.554
Not even close.

22:05.174 --> 22:07.141
We're closer than you think.

22:08.460 --> 22:11.429
My mother was murdered, too.

22:14.233 --> 22:15.683
I'm sorry.

22:15.685 --> 22:17.685
Yeah, I was pretty young.

22:17.687 --> 22:19.720
Uh, much younger than you were.

22:19.722 --> 22:22.006
But I still live with it
like it was yesterday.

22:22.008 --> 22:24.392
What can you do?

22:26.195 --> 22:29.180
Anyway, um, back to avoiding.

22:52.387 --> 22:54.005
Hey.

22:58.260 --> 22:59.310
Thanks for coming.

22:59.312 --> 23:00.561
So you found Ray Sheckman.

23:00.563 --> 23:01.646
I did.

23:01.648 --> 23:03.514
Are you sure that he's the one

23:03.516 --> 23:05.416
that ordered Darius
to kill Heather?

23:05.418 --> 23:07.235
From the photo
you sent me, absolutely.

23:07.237 --> 23:09.687
Okay, it's not gonna
be easy to prove.

23:09.689 --> 23:11.388
He has friends in high places.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.441
Well, that explains why
he hasn't been arrested.

before we get to him,

Yeah, that he was

who saw me kill Darius
in cold blood.

cops are those?

38:07.720 --> 38:10.087
Cops who put justice
above all else.

38:10.089 --> 38:11.755
I'm hoping you're one of them.

38:11.757 --> 38:13.607
You'd be right.

38:13.609 --> 38:14.975
I'm in.

38:16.728 --> 38:20.230
The vigilante is just one man,
with no one to protect him,

38:20.232 --> 38:22.833
unlike you guys, who protect
each other no matter what.

38:22.835 --> 38:24.735
Considering how dangerous he is,

38:24.737 --> 38:27.321
I value that more than
a bunch of Boy Scouts.

38:31.577 --> 38:34.244
Don't you think it's
taken too long to catch him?

38:34.246 --> 38:36.647
Which is why we've assembled
this task force:

38:36.649 --> 38:38.248
to do everything in our power

38:38.250 --> 38:40.233
to keep the people
of New York safe

38:40.235 --> 38:43.537
and to bring the so-called
vigilante to justice.

38:43.539 --> 38:46.340
And rest assured,
we will succeed.

38:56.718 --> 38:58.936
So who killed Ray?

38:58.938 --> 39:00.253
I don't know.

39:00.255 --> 39:01.689
And based on that
coroner's report,

39:01.691 --> 39:04.858
I doubt that we will
ever find out.

39:07.145 --> 39:08.862
I'm sorry, it gets worse.

39:08.864 --> 39:10.597
Um...
Yeah.

39:10.599 --> 39:12.783
Caught the press conference.

39:12.785 --> 39:16.487
As if Muirfield hunting
me down wasn't enough,

39:16.489 --> 39:19.740
now I have New York's finest
after me.

39:21.076 --> 39:22.826
Including you.

39:22.828 --> 39:24.795
I didn't have a choice.

39:24.797 --> 39:26.497
But I think

39:26.499 --> 39:27.931
it's a good thing; I can...

39:27.933 --> 39:30.217
keep an eye on things
from the inside.

39:30.219 --> 39:33.470
Vincent, I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

39:33.472 --> 39:36.674
Catherine, you can
only do so much.

39:36.676 --> 39:40.761
And now, let's face it,
with this task force,

39:40.763 --> 39:43.931
things aren't gonna end up
so well for me.

39:45.967 --> 39:48.769
I don't want to break
your heart.

39:51.472 --> 39:53.957
The only thing
that would break my heart

39:53.959 --> 39:57.861
is... looking back on my life

39:57.863 --> 40:00.748
and wishing that I had
done things differently.

40:01.983 --> 40:05.536
And as far as the rest
of the world goes,

40:05.538 --> 40:08.539
if we're together...

40:08.541 --> 40:11.125
we can overcome anything.

40:11.127 --> 40:14.128
Vincent...

40:14.130 --> 40:16.830
whoever that girl was...

40:18.800 --> 40:21.001
...she wasn't me.

40:22.854 --> 40:25.856
And...

40:25.858 --> 40:29.042
whatever your fears are...

40:32.564 --> 40:34.782
...they aren't mine.
