00:03.291 --> 00:05.083
♪ OHHH OHHH OHHH ♪

00:07.166 --> 00:09.000
(Pete) ELEANOR BERGEN.

00:09.041 --> 00:12.625
23 WEEKS IN, THE O.B. NOTICED
AN ABNORMALITY WITH THE BABY.

00:12.667 --> 00:15.792
SHE'S HERE TODAY FOR
A 3-D ULTRASOUND TO FOLLOW UP.

00:15.834 --> 00:18.417
WHOA.
I KNOW.

00:18.458 --> 00:22.125
WELL, THERE'S A BUILDUP
OF CEREBROSPINAL FLUID.
DOCTORS SPLIT
ON WHAT TO DO HERE.

00:22.166 --> 00:25.458
SOME SAY WAIT AS LONG
AS POSSIBLE TO TAKE THE BABY,

00:25.500 --> 00:28.667
THEN CLEAR IT ONCE IT'S OUT.
WELL, IF THE SWELLING CONTINUES,
THE BABY COULD HAVE

00:28.709 --> 00:31.125
SEVERE BRAIN DAMAGE AND POSSIBLY
RUPTURE THE MOTHER'S UTERUS.

00:31.166 --> 00:34.125
WELL, THAT'S THE OTHER CAMP.
THEY SAY DELIVER THE BABY NOW.

00:34.166 --> 00:37.667
23 WEEKS IS WAY TOO SOON.
OR TERMINATE.

00:37.709 --> 00:40.875
ELEANOR AND HER HUSBAND
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO,

00:40.917 --> 00:43.875
SO THEY CALLED ME, AND I
CALLED YOU TO BREAK THE TIE.

00:43.917 --> 00:45.875
THAT'S THE HUSBAND.
HI, RONALD.

00:45.917 --> 00:48.667
THIS IS THE DOCTOR
I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT.
HI, ADDISON MONTGOMERY.

00:48.709 --> 00:51.041
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING.
MY WIFE AND I

00:51.083 --> 00:53.041
A LITTLE FREAKED,
A LOT FREAKED, ACTUALLY.

00:53.083 --> 00:54.917
WE LOOK AT THE SCAN,
AT THE BABY'S HEAD...

00:54.959 --> 00:57.417
AND SHE'S IN THERE PRAYING
THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA TELL US

00:57.458 --> 01:01.125
TO GIVE UP.
LET'S, UH, TAKE A LOOK
AND WE'LL TALK AFTER, OKAY?

01:03.750 --> 01:05.125
(door opens)

01:09.959 --> 01:14.083
THIS IS MY WIFE...
ELEANOR.

01:20.083 --> 01:23.041
WELL, MAYBE THIS IS
MY PENANCE FOR PUSHING.

01:23.083 --> 01:26.208
EL...
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D HAVE
A CHILD UNTIL I MET RON,

01:26.250 --> 01:28.750
AND THEN WE JUST BOTH THOUGHT,
WHY NOT?

01:28.792 --> 01:31.458
WHY NOT TRY FOR EVERYTHING?
SO IT WAS A YEAR

01:31.500 --> 01:35.041
OF LOOKING FOR AN EGG DONOR,
THREE CYCLES OF I.V.F.

01:35.083 --> 01:39.125
NOW LOOK. (scoffs) JUST LOOK.
WHAT WERE WE THINKING?

01:39.166 --> 01:40.875
(Addison)
CONGENITAL HYDROCEPHALUS

01:40.917 --> 01:43.417
ISN'T NECESSARILY CORRELATED
WITH A MOTHER'S AGE.

01:43.458 --> 01:47.125
"NECESSARILY" BEING
THE OPERATIVE WORD.
IT'S A WASTE OF TIME
TO FEEL GUILTY.

01:47.166 --> 01:51.041
THIS IS OUR BABY.
THIS IS OUR CHANCE.
IF ELEANOR WERE TO
STAY HERE AND BE MONITORED,

01:51.083 --> 01:53.750
WOULD IT BE SAFE FOR HER TO
CONTINUE WITH THE PREGNANCY?

01:53.792 --> 01:55.875
I WOULDN'T, BUT THERE
COULD BE ANOTHER OPTION.

01:55.917 --> 01:58.041
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO
WHAT'S CALLED

01:58.083 --> 01:59.959
AN IN-UTERO
INTRACRANIAL SEPTOSTOMY.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
MEANING I'D GO IN
THROUGH THE UTERUS

02:02.041 --> 02:03.542
AND INTO THE BABY'S BRAIN,

02:03.583 --> 02:06.458
CREATE A HOLE
BETWEEN THE VENTRICLES.

02:06.500 --> 02:08.542
THAT WOULD DRAIN
SOME OF THE FLUID

02:08.583 --> 02:12.041
AND RELIEVE THE PRESSURE.
BRAIN SURGERY
WHILE THE BABY'S INSIDE ME?

02:12.083 --> 02:14.083
IS THAT... SAFE?

02:14.125 --> 02:18.125
HE MEANS, IS IT SAFE
FOR A WOMAN MY AGE?

02:18.166 --> 02:19.959
(Naomi) MAYA.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.959
I'M LEAVING NOW
IF YOU WANT A RIDE TO SCHOOL.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.333
I'LL CATCH THE BUS.

02:24.375 --> 02:26.583
ALL RIGHT. SIT NEAR
THE EMERGENCY EXIT.

02:26.625 --> 02:29.083
LOVE YOU. BYE.

02:32.083 --> 02:34.625
OH... (whispers indistinctly)

02:42.041 --> 02:44.125
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

02:44.166 --> 02:46.959
UM... CLOTHES AND MAKEUP.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.333
AND YOU WERE JUST GONNA WAIT
UNTIL I LEFT

02:49.375 --> 02:52.041
SO YOU COULD GO TO SCHOOL
DRESSED LIKE THAT?
THIS IS HOW ALL GIRLS DRESS.

02:52.083 --> 02:54.583
NOT THIS GIRL.
YOU HAVE FIVE SECONDS

02:54.625 --> 02:57.750
TO GET UPSTAIRS, WASH YOUR FACE
AND PUT ON SOMETHING DECENT.

02:57.792 --> 03:01.041
WE'LL DISCUSS HOW LONG
YOU'RE GROUNDED LATER.
YOU'RE RUINING MY LIFE.

03:01.083 --> 03:04.000
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
EXCUSE ME. WHAT DID YOU SAY?

03:04.041 --> 03:06.083
NOTHING!

03:06.125 --> 03:08.083
(door slams)

03:08.125 --> 03:09.792
(elevator bell dings)

03:09.834 --> 03:11.458
SHE'S 60 YEARS OLD, ADDISON.

03:11.500 --> 03:14.458
THE RISKS OF MAJOR SURGERY--
STROKE, ARRHYTHMIA,

03:14.500 --> 03:17.041
GETTING HER OFF THE VENTILATOR--
THEY'RE ALL MUCH HIGHER.
IT'S STILL THE BEST OPTION.

03:17.083 --> 03:20.041
FOR THE BABY, MAYBE.
BUT NOT FOR ELEANOR.
IF WE TRY TO STRING THIS OUT

03:20.083 --> 03:22.041
AND BRING IT CLOSER
TO VIABILITY,

03:22.083 --> 03:25.041
IT IS NOT JUST THE BABY
THAT COULD BE IN TROUBLE, PETE.

03:25.083 --> 03:27.542
I MEAN, YOU SAW THE SCAN.

03:27.583 --> 03:31.333
SHE'S GOT, LIKE, A LITTLE
TIME BOMB IN HER UTERUS.
THEN WE SHOULD ADVISE THEM
TO TERMINATE AND TRY AGAIN.

03:31.375 --> 03:34.542
AND WHAT ARE THE ODDS
OF THAT HAPPENING?
THEY COULD USE A SURROGATE
OR ADOPT.

03:34.583 --> 03:37.041
YOU THINK SOMEBODY'S GONNA GIVE
A 60-YEAR-OLD WOMAN A BABY?

03:37.083 --> 03:39.417
YOU THINK ELEANOR'S
TOO OLD TO BE A PARENT?

03:39.458 --> 03:41.458
I THINK IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD

03:41.500 --> 03:43.625
TO INTRODUCE YOUR PROM DATE
TO YOUR 80-YEAR-OLD MOTHER.

03:43.667 --> 03:45.208
THAT'S ONE OF THE DOWNSIDES

03:45.250 --> 03:47.208
OF GETTING GOOD
AT FERTILITY TREATMENT.

03:47.250 --> 03:50.208
EVERYONE THINKS THEY SHOULD BE
ABLE TO HAVE THEIR OWN BABY,

03:50.250 --> 03:52.291
EVEN AT 60.
I DON'T KNOW.

03:52.333 --> 03:55.291
MAYBE THIS CHILD
JUST WASN'T MEANT TO BE.

03:55.333 --> 03:57.917
NOT MY B--NOT OUR--
NOT LUCAS.

03:57.959 --> 04:01.041
A PATIENT.
SHE'S 60 AND PREGNANT.
OH.

04:01.083 --> 04:03.041
WELL, IF SHE'S HAPPY SENDING
HER HUSBAND OUT

04:03.083 --> 04:05.500
FOR DENTURES AND DIAPERS,
THEN MORE POWER TO HER.

04:05.542 --> 04:07.583
YEAH, WELL,
THE HUSBAND'S 30.

04:07.625 --> 04:09.083
EVEN MORE POWER TO HER.

04:09.125 --> 04:12.000
NOW WAIT A MINUTE. WHEN PETE
WAS DATING YOUNGER WOMAN,

04:12.041 --> 04:14.333
YOU SAID IT WAS DISGUSTING.
DON'T BRING ME INTO THIS.

04:14.375 --> 04:17.333
NO, I'M JUST POINTING OUT THAT
VIOLET HAS A DOUBLE STANDARD.

04:17.375 --> 04:20.542
THERE IS A STIGMA ATTACHED
TO DATING OLDER WOMEN,

04:20.583 --> 04:23.709
SO I FIGURE IF A GUY DOES, HE'S
IN IT FOR THE RIGHT REASONS.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.125
OH, RIGHT. LUNCH.

04:28.166 --> 04:31.750
UH... PETE, THIS IS
MY FATHER, THE CAPTAIN.

04:31.792 --> 04:33.542
NICE TO MEET YOU.
YEAH.

04:33.583 --> 04:36.000
AND, UH, THIS IS, UH...

04:39.583 --> 04:41.333
OH, HI. SORRY.

04:41.375 --> 04:44.041
NOT AT ALL.

04:44.083 --> 04:47.041
SEE?
IT IS DISGUSTING.

04:47.083 --> 04:48.792
COME ON, LET'S GO.

04:52.208 --> 04:56.083
I ALMOST KILLED
YOUR CHILD TODAY.
OH, SO TODAY SHE'S MY CHILD.

04:56.125 --> 04:59.166
NO, YOU WOULD'VE HAD TO
BURY HER BODY IN SECRET

04:59.208 --> 05:02.000
TO KEEP ME FROM GOING TO JAIL.
OKAY, WHAT'D SHE DO?

05:02.041 --> 05:04.041
SHE TRIED TO
SNEAK OUT OF THE HOUSE

05:04.083 --> 05:07.041
DRESSED UP LIKE SOME
25-YEAR-OLD I DON'T KNOW WHAT.

05:07.083 --> 05:09.542
(laughs) YOU REMEMBER WHEN SHE
USED TO PUT ON YOUR LIPSTICK--

05:09.583 --> 05:13.083
SAM, SHE'S NOT 4,
AND THIS IS NOT SWEET.
OH, COME ON NOW, NAI.

05:13.125 --> 05:16.041
DON'T "NAI" ME. SHE WAS TRYING
TO PULL ONE OVER ON ME.

05:16.083 --> 05:18.583
AND THEN WHEN I CALLED HER
ON IT, SHE STOMPED AWAY

05:18.625 --> 05:21.625
AND SLAMMED THE DOOR,
IN MY HOUSE.
YOU SAID YOU
ALMOST KILLED HER, RIGHT?

05:21.667 --> 05:23.625
I AM NOT GONNA LET
OUR DAUGHTER TURN INTO

05:23.667 --> 05:25.625
ONE OF THOSE SNOT-NOSED
PRIVATE SCHOOL KIDS

05:25.667 --> 05:28.625
WHO JUST THINKS THAT THEY CAN
DO WHATEVER THEY WANT.
THAT IS NOT MAYA.

05:28.667 --> 05:31.625
WELL, APPARENTLY,
WE DON'T KNOW MAYA.
WELL, TRY NOT TO GET
YOURSELF ALL WORKED UP.

05:31.667 --> 05:33.834
SAM, SHE IS
HIDING THINGS FROM ME,

05:33.875 --> 05:35.917
WHICH MEANS
SHE DOESN'T TRUST ME

05:35.959 --> 05:38.417
OR SHE IS DOING SOMETHING
THAT SHE KNOWS IS WRONG.

05:38.458 --> 05:40.417
AND YOU THINK THIS IS
MORE THAN HER

05:40.458 --> 05:43.041
JUST PUTTING ON
SOME SKIMPY CLOTHES?
I DON'T KNOW.

05:43.083 --> 05:46.041
I DON'T KNOW, BUT I'M GONNA
TURN HER ROOM UPSIDE DOWN

05:46.083 --> 05:49.792
UNTIL I FIGURE OUT
EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON.
(sighs)

05:49.834 --> 05:52.166
(coos)
WELL, UH, RUTHIE LOOKS FINE.
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

05:52.208 --> 05:55.250
GREAT.
YEAH, YOU GOT
THESE TWO LITTLE ONES

05:55.291 --> 05:58.041
AND 4 OTHERS AT HOME
UNDER, WHAT, 8,

05:58.083 --> 06:00.959
AND YOU'RE--
YOU'RE GREAT, HUH?
I'M VERY BLESSED.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.750
DOESN'T MEAN
YOU CAN'T COMPLAIN.

06:02.792 --> 06:06.000
TELL ME YOU'RE EXHAUSTED.
OH, I GAVE UP ON SLEEP
A LONG TIME AGO.

06:06.041 --> 06:08.500
I MEAN, YOU GOT
NO TIME TO YOURSELF OR...

06:11.250 --> 06:13.208
IT'S, UH, SHIMMON.

06:13.250 --> 06:16.166
YEAH, IT'S YOUR HUSBAND?
HE'S NOT...

06:16.208 --> 06:18.709
INTERESTED.

06:20.792 --> 06:23.333
OH, UH, OKAY.
WELL, THAT, UH, THAT HAPPENS.

06:23.375 --> 06:25.250
SOME MEN FEEL AWKWARD
WITH THEIR WIVES

06:25.291 --> 06:28.041
DURING OR SOMETIMES EVEN AFTER
PREGNANCY, BUT IT PASSES.

06:28.083 --> 06:31.041
DR. FREEDMAN, I SHOULDN'T BE
TALKING TO YOU ABOUT THIS.

06:31.083 --> 06:33.208
IT'S NOT PROPER.
IF THERE'S A PROBLEM--

06:33.250 --> 06:36.333
IT'S NOT PROPER, AND, UH,
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN HELP.

06:39.333 --> 06:41.417
I NEED YOUR HELP.

06:41.458 --> 06:43.417
IF YOU KNEW SOMEBODY
WAS ADMIRING YOU,

06:43.458 --> 06:45.041
SPECIFICALLY YOUR ASS,

06:45.083 --> 06:47.041
WOULD THAT
JUST BE FLATTERING,

06:47.083 --> 06:49.375
OR WOULD THAT
GET YOU AROUSED?

06:49.417 --> 06:51.000
WHO'S ADMIRING MY ASS?

06:51.041 --> 06:53.000
'CAUSE I THINK THAT WOULD BE
AROUSING, RIGHT?

06:53.041 --> 06:55.000
YEAH.
TO KNOW THAT SOMEBODY
RIGHT NEAR YOU

06:55.041 --> 06:57.041
IS THINKING ABOUT YOU
SEXUALLY?

06:57.083 --> 06:59.250
WAIT, WHO ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT, ME OR YOU?

06:59.291 --> 07:01.333
W-WE'RE TALKING ABOUT Y-YOU,
RIGHT?

07:01.375 --> 07:03.333
YOU ASKED ME TO HELP YOU
WITH SOMETHING?

07:03.375 --> 07:05.333
OH, YEAH. UM, A PATIENT.

07:05.375 --> 07:07.417
TWO MONTHS POSTPARTUM,
AND SHE'S CONCERNED

07:07.458 --> 07:09.750
'CAUSE HER HUSBAND
IS NOT INTERESTED IN SEX.

07:09.792 --> 07:11.750
OH, WELL, COULD BE
DEPRESSION, STRESS,

07:11.792 --> 07:13.125
PERFORMANCE ANXIETY.

07:13.166 --> 07:15.041
UNLESS IT'S VASCULAR DISEASE,
HYPERTHYROIDISM,

07:15.083 --> 07:16.625
IATROGENIC IMPOTENCE.

07:16.667 --> 07:18.834
FORGET WHERE
MY OFFICE IS, COOP,

07:18.875 --> 07:21.083
THE ONE WITH
ALL THE MARITAL AIDS

07:21.125 --> 07:24.250
AND BOOKS YOU SNEAK IN
TO LOOK AT DURING LUNCH?
NO, I WAS JUST--

07:24.291 --> 07:26.667
REFERRING A PATIENT TO VIOLET
YOU SHOULD BE REFERRING TO ME

07:26.709 --> 07:30.875
BECAUSE YOU'RE STILL MAD
AND PETTY.
PETTINESS ASIDE, THERE'S NO
REASON TO JUMP TO PHYSIOLOGY.

07:30.917 --> 07:32.917
I MEAN, SEX ISSUES,
MORE OFTEN THAN NOT,

07:32.959 --> 07:34.959
ARE ROOTED IN
EMOTIONAL DYSFUNCTIONS.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.166
YES.
ACTUALLY, WE'RE FINDING
MORE AND MORE

07:38.208 --> 07:41.166
THAT PROBLEMS IN THE BEDROOM
STEM FROM HORMONAL IMBALANCES,

07:41.208 --> 07:43.458
NERVE PROBLEMS, ALL KINDS
OF EQUIPMENT FAILURE.

07:43.500 --> 07:46.375
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? I WOULD
LIKE TO SEE HER ALONE FIRST.

07:46.417 --> 07:48.667
I THOUGHT WE WERE
ONE BIG TEAM HERE AT O.W.G.

07:48.709 --> 07:51.792
OR IS THAT ONLY WHEN YOU WANT IN
ON OTHER PEOPLE'S PATIENTS?

07:54.083 --> 07:57.291
(indistinct conversations)

07:59.792 --> 08:01.917
SO HOW EXACTLY
DO YOU SEE THIS WORKING?

08:01.959 --> 08:04.917
HAVING AN AWKWARD LUNCH
TOGETHER EVERY FEW DAYS

08:04.959 --> 08:07.500
THAT IT TAKES YOU THREE
VODKA TONICS TO GET THROUGH

08:07.542 --> 08:10.542
AND ME A HALF A BOTTLE OF WINE
AT NIGHT TO FORGET?

08:10.583 --> 08:12.834
ADDISON, PLEASE.

08:12.875 --> 08:14.166
(clears throat)

08:14.208 --> 08:16.542
I ENJOYED
SEEING YOUR OFFICE.

08:16.583 --> 08:18.750
VIOLET'S ASS
OR THE WHOLE THING?

08:18.792 --> 08:22.125
I'D LIKE
TO SEE YOUR HOUSE.

08:22.166 --> 08:25.041
SO WE COULD SIT THERE
AND STARE AT EACH OTHER,

08:25.083 --> 08:27.417
SEE WHO BLINKS FIRST
WITHOUT EVEN A WAITER

08:27.458 --> 08:29.041
TO BREAK THE TENSION?

08:29.083 --> 08:30.625
(chuckles) NO.

08:32.542 --> 08:34.834
YOU WORKING ON
ANYTHING INTERESTING?

08:34.875 --> 08:36.208
(chuckles) I'M JUST...

08:36.250 --> 08:39.041
I'M TRYING, ADDISON.

08:39.083 --> 08:41.041
(clears throat)

08:43.083 --> 08:47.959
I MIGHT BE DOING AN IN-UTERO
INTRACRANIAL SEPTOSTOMY.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.166
REALLY?

08:50.709 --> 08:52.667
TRICK THERE IS GETTING
A GOOD ANGLE

08:52.709 --> 08:55.000
ON THE FORAMEN OF MONRO.

08:55.041 --> 08:56.166
RIGHT.

08:56.208 --> 08:59.041
AND THEN FINDING THE AVASCULAR
PLANE OF THE SEPTUM.

08:59.083 --> 09:01.583
YES. YEAH.

09:04.834 --> 09:06.792
SO WOULD YOU GO

09:06.834 --> 09:10.917
TO THE CONTRALATERAL
VENTRICLE FIRST?

09:12.250 --> 09:15.875
(Maya laughs)

09:15.917 --> 09:19.083
MOM.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HOME?

09:24.125 --> 09:29.000
I DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU ARE...

09:29.041 --> 09:31.208
BUT YOU SHOULD LEAVE.

09:31.250 --> 09:33.000
YES, MA'AM.

09:37.083 --> 09:39.458
(door opens)
MOM?

09:39.500 --> 09:41.041
DON'T...
(door closes)

09:41.083 --> 09:43.917
TALK.

09:43.959 --> 09:45.250
ONE...

09:45.291 --> 09:46.375
TWO...

09:46.417 --> 09:48.375
MOM, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO?

09:48.417 --> 09:50.417
THREE... FOUR...

09:50.458 --> 09:52.458
MOM,
WHY ARE YOU COUNTING?

09:52.500 --> 09:53.750
FIVE...

09:53.792 --> 09:56.041
I AM TRYING
TO CALM MYSELF DOWN.

09:56.083 --> 09:57.917
SIX...

09:57.959 --> 09:59.041
SEVEN...

09:59.083 --> 10:01.041
IT'S NOT WORKING.
MOM--

10:01.083 --> 10:02.542
CALL YOUR FATHER.

10:02.583 --> 10:05.500
TELL HIM TO COME HERE NOW
AND SAVE YOUR LIFE.

10:09.083 --> 10:12.041
IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME
SHIMMON HASN'T BEEN INTERESTED

10:12.083 --> 10:14.750
AFTER WE'VE HAD A BABY, BUT IT'S
LASTING LONGER THIS TIME.

10:14.792 --> 10:16.667
AND I STARTED THINKING...

10:16.709 --> 10:19.083
DOES YOUR HUSBAND F--
HOW OFTEN DO YOU
AND YOUR HUSBAND...

10:21.083 --> 10:23.375
OKAY, WELL, OTHER THAN
THE LACK OF INTEREST,

10:23.417 --> 10:26.125
HAVE YOU NOTICED ANYTHING ELSE
DIFFERENT ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND?

10:26.166 --> 10:28.458
WELL, LIKE WHAT?
IS HE EMOTIONALLY DISTANT?

10:28.500 --> 10:30.709
NOT AT ALL.
SHIMMON'S WONDERFUL.

10:30.750 --> 10:33.542
OH. OH, GOOD.
WELL, HAVE YOU NOTICED--

10:33.583 --> 10:36.458
ANY PHYSICAL CHANGES?
WELL, HE HASN'T BEEN
SLEEPING WELL,

10:36.500 --> 10:39.583
SO HE'S ALWAYS UP POKING AROUND
THE FRIDGE WITH WEIRD CRAVINGS.

10:39.625 --> 10:42.250
AND, WELL,
MAYBE I'M IMAGINING IT,

10:42.291 --> 10:45.041
BUT UP HERE...
GETTING A LITTLE FLABBY?

10:45.083 --> 10:47.792
IT'S THE COUVADE.
WHAT'S THAT?

10:47.834 --> 10:49.583
WELL, SOMETIMES
A WOMAN'S PREGNANCY

10:49.625 --> 10:51.583
CAUSES CHANGES
IN HER PARTNER'S HORMONES.

10:51.625 --> 10:53.583
HIS TESTOSTERONE GETS
CONVERTED TO ESTROGEN.

10:53.625 --> 10:56.166
IT'S A SYMPATHETIC REACTION,
SO HIS SYMPTOMS MIMIC YOURS.

10:56.208 --> 10:58.583
BUT IT'S EASILY TREATABLE--
COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY--

10:58.625 --> 11:00.875
ANDROGEN SUPPLEMENTATION.

11:00.917 --> 11:04.417
EITHER WAY, WE CAN HELP YOU GET
SHIMMON CHARGED RIGHT BACK UP.

11:04.458 --> 11:07.000
I'M SORRY. MAYBE I'M NOT
BEING CLEAR.

11:07.041 --> 11:10.166
THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANT AT ALL.
I LOVE MY HUSBAND.

11:10.208 --> 11:12.166
I LOVE BEING INTIMATE WITH HIM.

11:12.208 --> 11:14.417
BUT I CAN'T HAVE HIM
CHARGED BACK UP.

11:14.458 --> 11:17.500
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED
HELP WITH YOUR SEX LIFE.

11:17.542 --> 11:20.291
WE HAVE SIX KIDS
WHO I ADORE.

11:20.333 --> 11:22.041
BUT IF I HAVE TO RAISE

11:22.083 --> 11:25.583
OR SHIMMON HAS TO PROVIDE
FOR ANY MORE...

11:25.625 --> 11:27.917
WE CAN'T USE BIRTH CONTROL,

11:27.959 --> 11:31.208
BUT WE CAN'T HAVE MORE KIDS.

11:31.250 --> 11:33.208
SO THIS COUVADE,

11:33.250 --> 11:37.667
IS THERE ANY WAY TO
KEEP IT GOING PERMANENTLY?

11:37.709 --> 11:39.667
SHE WANTS YOU
TO KEEP HIM TAMED,

11:39.709 --> 11:42.125
AND YOU'RE OKAY
WITH THAT?
WELL, PEOPLE HAVE

11:42.166 --> 11:43.959
MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIPS
WITHOUT HAVING SEX.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.959
AND YET, WHEN THEY'RE NOT
HAVING IT,

11:46.000 --> 11:48.333
IT'S USUALLY A SIGN THAT
THERE'S A PROBLEM, ISN'T IT?

11:48.375 --> 11:50.959
YOU ASKED ME
TO HELP, COOPER.
NO, ACTUALLY,
I ASKED VIOLET TO HELP.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.333
AND I DON'T THINK THAT WHAT
RACHEL NEEDS RIGHT NOW

11:53.375 --> 11:55.333
IS FOR YOU
TO BRING HER BACK IN

11:55.375 --> 11:58.041
AND START TOSSING AROUND WORDS
LIKE "ORAL" AND "ANAL."
WELL, PERSONALLY,

11:58.083 --> 12:00.041
I DON'T THINK RACHEL NEEDS
TO GIVE UP SEX AT ALL.

12:00.083 --> 12:02.125
I MEAN, WHY SHOULD A WOMAN

12:02.166 --> 12:04.375
WHO'S FEELING SOMETHING
NOT ACT ON IT?

12:04.417 --> 12:07.041
NO MATTER HOW DEEPLY
SHE TRIES TO BURY HER FEELINGS,

12:07.083 --> 12:09.166
EVENTUALLY, THEY'RE GONNA
COME BACK, RIGHT?

12:09.208 --> 12:11.792
I THINK WE NEED TO
CONVINCE HER THAT IT'S OKAY

12:11.834 --> 12:15.041
TO USE BIRTH CONTROL.
WELL, I AGREE, BUT I DON'T
THINK SHE'S GOING THERE.

12:15.083 --> 12:18.000
I THINK WE'RE MISSING
A MAJOR PART OF THIS EQUATION.

12:18.041 --> 12:20.417
SEX... GUY INVOLVED.

12:20.458 --> 12:23.166
OR AT LEAST
THERE'S SUPPOSED TO BE.
YOU KNOW, HE'S RIGHT.

12:23.208 --> 12:26.250
WE SHOULD GET SHIMMON TO HELP.
BUT IF RACHEL
WON'T TALK TO A MAN,

12:26.291 --> 12:30.041
WOULD SHIMMON
TALK TO A WOMAN?

12:30.083 --> 12:31.625
(elevator bell dings)

12:31.667 --> 12:34.625
WELL, THEN EVEN IF THE BUILDUP
OF C.S.F. IS SIGNIFICANT,

12:34.667 --> 12:37.083
YOU CAN STILL GET
COMPLETE RESOLUTION.
IDEALLY, YES.

12:37.125 --> 12:39.041
UH...

12:39.083 --> 12:41.667
SO...
I HAVE A PATIENT,

12:41.709 --> 12:44.667
AND, UM, THEN I HAVE TO GO
TO THE HOSPITAL AFTER THAT.

12:44.709 --> 12:47.667
SO THANK YOU FOR LUNCH.

12:47.709 --> 12:49.458
OKAY.

12:52.125 --> 12:55.250
OH, HELLO.

12:55.291 --> 12:57.667
DR. MONTGOMERY.

12:57.709 --> 12:59.458
W--CAPTAIN.

13:01.959 --> 13:04.208
CAPTAIN.

13:04.250 --> 13:05.667
(chuckles)

13:07.083 --> 13:09.041
(Naomi) SHE WAS HERE

13:09.083 --> 13:12.875
DITCHING SCHOOL
ON HER BACK WITH SOME BOY.
HIS NAME IS DINK.

13:12.917 --> 13:15.875
YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU TWO
WERE JUST FRIENDS.
WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT.

13:15.917 --> 13:18.041
WHAT, WHAT, YOU--
YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS DINK?

13:18.083 --> 13:21.000
UH, NOT--NOT MUCH.
I-I KNOW THAT SHE LIKES HIM

13:21.041 --> 13:23.000
AND THAT HE'S IN THE BAND.

13:23.041 --> 13:24.667
HE'S IN A BAND, DAD.

13:24.709 --> 13:28.041
YOU TOLD ME
HE WAS IN THE BAND.

13:28.083 --> 13:30.959
(sighs) YOU TWO AREN'T...
HAVING SEX?

13:31.000 --> 13:33.583
NO!
SO YOU SAY. HOW ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO TRUST YOU, MAYA,

13:33.625 --> 13:36.583
WHEN YOU GO AND YOU DO
SOMETHING LIKE THIS

13:36.625 --> 13:38.709
AND YOU SHOW
SUCH POOR JUDGMENT?

13:38.750 --> 13:42.041
SO HAVING A BOYFRIEND
COUNTS AS POOR JUDGMENT?
YES. DID I SAY YOU COULD HAVE
A BOYFRIEND?

13:42.083 --> 13:44.166
DID I SAY
YOU COULD TALK TO BOYS?

13:44.208 --> 13:47.333
DID I SAY YOU COULD EVEN
BE AROUND A BOY?
OKAY, L--CALM DOWN.

13:47.375 --> 13:50.041
ALL RIGHT, LET'S JUST TRY
TO DISCUSS THIS RATIONALLY.
THAT'S FINE WITH ME.

13:50.083 --> 13:52.291
MOM IS THE ONE THAT'S
GETTING ALL WORKED UP.

13:52.333 --> 13:54.083
MAYA.

13:54.125 --> 13:57.041
MAYBE IF YOU HAD
A BOYFRIEND...
(gasps)

13:57.083 --> 13:59.834
WHAT? I WILL--I-I WILL KILL
THIS CHILD, SAM.
DON'T--NO, SHE--

13:59.875 --> 14:02.542
YOU--YOU BETTER GO UPSTAIRS
AND PACK A BAG.

14:02.583 --> 14:06.000
WHAT?
GO UPSTAIRS AND PACK
A BAG... (whispers) NOW.

14:12.959 --> 14:14.542
OKAY, DON'T WORRY.

14:14.583 --> 14:16.583
ALL RIGHT? I-I GOT THIS.

14:16.625 --> 14:19.583
UM, I'LL BRING HER OVER TO
MY HOUSE FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

14:19.625 --> 14:22.041
YOU'VE BEEN DOING ALL
THE PARENTING. IT'S MY TURN.

14:22.083 --> 14:24.000
THANK YOU.
I-I-I GOT THIS.

14:24.041 --> 14:26.125
YEAH,
YOU BETTER HAVE IT, SAM.

14:26.166 --> 14:29.542
THIS IS OUR CHILD.

14:29.583 --> 14:32.875
WHAT'S BRADYCARDIA?
IT MEANS THAT THE BABY'S
HEART RATE HAS SLOWED DOWN.

14:32.917 --> 14:35.000
NOBODY SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT THE HEART.

14:35.041 --> 14:38.041
IT'S A SIDE EFFECT
OF INCREASED CRANIAL PRESSURE.

14:38.083 --> 14:40.125
HOW DANGEROUS IS IT?

14:40.166 --> 14:43.041
(printer whirring)

14:43.083 --> 14:46.750
(paper rustling)

14:46.792 --> 14:49.458
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

14:49.500 --> 14:52.500
YOUR BABY ISN'T GOING
TO MAKE IT TO VIABILITY.

14:52.542 --> 14:55.792
WE EITHER NEED TO PERFORM
THE SEPTOSTOMY

14:55.834 --> 14:58.417
OR TERMINATE THE PREGNANCY.

14:58.458 --> 15:00.875
I'M SORRY.

15:00.917 --> 15:03.417
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

15:05.083 --> 15:07.500
LET'S JUST WORRY
ABOUT THE BABY.

15:07.542 --> 15:11.166
HOW SOON CAN YOU OPERATE?

15:11.208 --> 15:13.583
(Blue Roses' "Doubtful Comforts"

DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY WAY

16:40.125 --> 16:42.291
TO EXPLAIN IT TO HER
THAT SHE'D UNDERSTAND?

16:42.333 --> 16:44.291
EMOTIONAL DISCUSSIONS
ARE NOT OUR FORTE,

16:44.333 --> 16:46.083
SO I DON'T KNOW.

16:46.125 --> 16:48.291
THAT'S SAD.

16:48.333 --> 16:51.041
IT IS.

16:51.083 --> 16:54.000
I WAS ALWAYS...
WORKING, TRAVELING

GOING ON.

16:58.959 --> 17:02.166

BUT IN THE AGGREGATE,
I SUPPOSE I...

17:06.625 --> 17:08.458
LOST TRACK OF HER,

17:08.500 --> 17:10.458
OF WHO SHE IS ANYWAY.

17:10.500 --> 17:12.875
BUT YOU'RE HERE NOW TRYING.

17:12.917 --> 17:16.125
I GUESS I SHOULD JUST
TRY HARDER.

17:16.166 --> 17:19.166

MORE HERE...

17:19.208 --> 17:22.041
IN HER ELEMENT...

17:22.083 --> 17:25.125
THAT MIGHT MAKE IT EASIER.

IT MIGHT BE GOOD

17:40.625 --> 17:42.375

IF YOU TAKE
HER SIDE IN THIS,

17:45.083 --> 17:48.041
I SWEAR, I WILL TAKE
MY CHOCOLATE AND I WILL LEAVE.
I AM NOT.

17:48.083 --> 17:50.583
I AM ON YOUR SIDE, NAI...
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH.

17:50.625 --> 17:53.041
I MEAN, HONESTLY, YOU'D BE
HARD-PRESSED TO FIND SOMEONE

17:53.083 --> 17:56.041
WHO KNOWS LESS ABOUT FUNCTIONAL
PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIPS.

17:56.083 --> 17:58.917
WHAT, IS THE CAPTAIN THAT BAD?
HE SAYS HE WANTS
TO SPEND TIME WITH ME,

17:58.959 --> 18:01.041
BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW
TO SPEND TIME WITH ME.

18:01.083 --> 18:03.792
WE TALKED ABOUT SURGERY.
HE LECTURES, AND I PRETEND

18:03.834 --> 18:07.041
TO NOT ALREADY KNOW
WHAT HE'S TELLING ME.

18:07.083 --> 18:10.041
I SHOULD JUST SEND HIM HOME,
LET HIM AND BIZZY CLANK AROUND

18:10.083 --> 18:12.542
IN THAT EMPTY HOUSE
IN WASP-Y SILENCE.

18:12.583 --> 18:14.542
YEAH, WELL, SITTING AROUND
IN YOUR EMPTY HOUSE,

18:14.583 --> 18:17.834
YOU START TO HAVE DOUBTS.

18:17.875 --> 18:20.667
WILL YOU PLEASE TELL ME THAT
I AM DOING THE RIGHT THING?

18:20.709 --> 18:23.041
YOU ARE DOING
THE RIGHT THING, NAI.

18:23.083 --> 18:25.041
(knock on door)

I DON'T MEAN TO DISTURB YOU.

18:27.667 --> 18:29.917
NAOMI.
CAPTAIN, HOW ARE YOU?

18:29.959 --> 18:31.959
I CAME TO ASK A FAVOR.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.041
I WAS HOPING
I COULD OBSERVE YOU

18:35.083 --> 18:37.041
PERFORM THE SEPTOSTOMY.

18:37.083 --> 18:40.208
YOU WANT TO WATCH...

18:40.250 --> 18:43.250
ME?
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU WORK.

18:43.291 --> 18:46.875
I KNOW YOUR REPUTATION,
OF COURSE, BUT, UH...

18:46.917 --> 18:49.041
I'D LIKE TO SEE IT,
TO SEE... YOU.

18:49.083 --> 18:51.333
(mouth full) OKAY.

18:51.375 --> 18:53.667
IF IT'S NOT AN IMPOSITION--

18:53.709 --> 18:56.000
JUST TAKE YES AS AN ANSWER.

18:58.417 --> 19:01.583
LOOK, I WORK TWO JOBS
SIX DAYS A WEEK,

19:01.625 --> 19:03.792
AND RACHEL IS CONSUMED.

19:03.834 --> 19:05.792
SHE MAKES OUR HOME,

19:05.834 --> 19:08.792
SHE JUGGLES SCHOOLS AND DOCTORS
AND MEALS AND BIRTHDAYS--

19:08.834 --> 19:11.458
SO MANY THINGS,
I LOSE TRACK.

19:11.500 --> 19:15.709
EXACTLY, SO AT A CERTAIN POINT,
WHETHER IT'S 7 OR 9 OR 12 KIDS,

19:15.750 --> 19:18.041
DO YOU THINK
YOU'LL WANT TO STOP?

19:18.083 --> 19:20.917
THE TORAH TELLS US
"TO BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY,"

19:20.959 --> 19:23.291
FILL THE EARTH
AND SUBDUE IT.

19:23.333 --> 19:26.083
WE INTERPRET THAT TO MEAN
THAT WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING

19:26.125 --> 19:29.041
TO TRY TO PREVENT A PREGNANCY.

19:29.083 --> 19:32.041
I LOVE MY WIFE.

19:32.083 --> 19:36.417
AND NEITHER ONE OF US WANTS TO
GIVE UP... YOU KNOW--

19:36.458 --> 19:38.417
WHAT IF
WE COULD FIND SOMETHING

19:38.458 --> 19:41.375
THAT WASN'T TECHNICALLY
BIRTH CONTROL?

19:41.417 --> 19:43.041
UH...

19:43.083 --> 19:45.834
WE HAVE CHOSEN TO BE FAITHFUL,
DR. FREEDMAN.

19:45.875 --> 19:47.542
WHO WOULD WE BE FOOLING?

19:49.542 --> 19:52.333
(footsteps approach)

19:54.417 --> 19:56.208
PEOPLE ARE UNPREDICTABLE.

19:56.250 --> 19:59.208
LOOK, ADDISON--
JUST WHEN YOU THINK
YOU KNOW SOMEONE,

19:59.250 --> 20:02.208
THEY GO AHEAD
AND DO SOMETHING NICE.
WAIT, WHAT?

20:02.250 --> 20:05.041
MY FATHER. HE WANTS TO
WATCH ME DO SURGERY.

20:05.083 --> 20:08.000
I MEAN, THE MAN NEVER MADE
A SINGLE PIANO RECITAL,

20:08.041 --> 20:10.834
TENNIS MATCH--
NOTHING MY WHOLE LIFE.

20:10.875 --> 20:13.000
AND SUDDENLY--
THAT'S--THAT'S GREAT.

20:13.041 --> 20:16.375
VIOLET, LOOK, I KNOW THAT
YOU THINK PEOPLE CAN CHANGE,

20:16.417 --> 20:19.625
BUT DO YOU REALLY THINK
THE CAPTAIN--

20:19.667 --> 20:21.166

20:36.625 --> 20:39.041

NOTHING IS WRONG WITH ME.

20:39.083 --> 20:41.709

DID SOMETHING NORMAL.

20:41.750 --> 20:43.583
CONGRATULATIONS.

20:43.625 --> 20:46.041

20:46.083 --> 20:48.625

20:48.667 --> 20:51.583
I DIDN'T THINK I WOULD,
BUT THEN I DID.

20:51.625 --> 20:56.000
AND IT WAS... NORMAL. I DIDN'T
EVEN THINK I CARED ANYMORE,

20:56.041 --> 20:58.834
BUT THEN I SLEPT WITH
THE CAPTAIN, AND IT WAS

20:58.875 --> 21:00.917
THE MOST NORMAL THING
I'VE DONE SINCE THE ATTACK.

21:00.959 --> 21:03.959
DID I JUST SAY HIS NAME OUT
LOUD? BECAUSE I WAS THINKING IT,

21:04.000 --> 21:07.125
AND THEN I JUST--
YEAH, I SAID IT OUT LOUD.
SO ALL THAT ABOUT
GETTING YOUR NEEDS MET--

21:07.166 --> 21:09.125

THIS WAS NOT ABOUT SEX.

21:12.083 --> 21:13.667
EXCEPT FOR THE PART

21:13.709 --> 21:16.041

21:21.667 --> 21:24.625

SHE'S BECOMING HER OWN PERSON.

21:24.667 --> 21:26.417

21:26.458 --> 21:28.417

ROLL AROUND ON THE COUCH

21:28.458 --> 21:30.041

21:32.083 --> 21:34.709

HE'S THE KIND OF GUY

21:34.750 --> 21:37.375

OH, HEY, HEY, HEY.

21:37.417 --> 21:40.291
HEY, DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU
WERE LIKE WHEN YOU WERE HIS AGE?

21:40.333 --> 21:43.375

21:45.083 --> 21:47.041

21:47.083 --> 21:50.000
OKAY, I WILL TALK TO HER
ABOUT HIM.

21:50.041 --> 21:51.917
TALKING'S GOOD,
BUT YELLING'S FINE, TOO.

21:51.959 --> 21:54.083

22:19.959 --> 22:21.583

22:21.625 --> 22:25.333

ELEANOR HAS TO HAVE SURGERY.

I'M SCARED, TOO, RONNIE.

22:28.959 --> 22:30.291

22:53.083 --> 22:57.125

WHAT'S BEST FOR ELEANOR,

23:05.083 --> 23:08.000

FOR THE BABY,

23:08.041 --> 23:10.834

23:10.875 --> 23:14.166

23:16.709 --> 23:19.166

25:16.875 --> 25:19.917
SHE'D SIT IN THE BACK OF
MY CLASS CUTTING ON A HOT DOG

25:19.959 --> 25:23.208

WORKED ON THEIR CADAVERS.

25:23.250 --> 25:26.667

26:27.625 --> 26:30.041
IT'S A MITZVAH, GUYS.

26:30.083 --> 26:32.959
MARRIED PEOPLE
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE HAVING SEX.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.959
WHETHER OR NOT
THEY'RE TRYING TO HAVE KIDS?

26:35.000 --> 26:37.625
ABSOLUTELY. JUDAISM IS UNIQUE
AMONG THE MAJOR WORLD RELIGIONS

26:37.667 --> 26:40.125
IN THAT IT PROMOTES SEX
NOT JUST FOR PROCREATION

26:40.166 --> 26:41.959
BUT FOR PLEASURE.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.834
YOU SEE? YOU SHOULD COME

26:44.875 --> 26:47.041
YOU'D LEARN
ALL SORTS OF GOOD THINGS.

26:47.083 --> 26:49.208
THAT'S GOOD. SEX IS GOOD.

26:49.250 --> 26:52.083
BUT EVEN IF PEOPLE ARE JUST
HAVING SEX FOR PLEASURE,

26:52.125 --> 26:55.333
BABIES HAPPEN.
AND YOU WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT BIRTH CONTROL.

26:55.375 --> 26:57.959

27:02.750 --> 27:05.875
YOU'RE RIGHT. IT--IT'S ALL
ABOUT INTERPRETATION.

27:05.917 --> 27:08.166
DEPENDING UPON HOW OBSERVANT
THEY ARE, SOME JEWS FEEL

AND--AND VIOLET TOLD CHARLOTTE,

30:29.667 --> 30:31.208
AND CHARLOTTE TOLD COOPER,

30:31.250 --> 30:33.750
AND THEN SAM READ IT
ALL OVER COOPER'S FACE,

30:33.792 --> 30:36.834
AND THEN HE DIDN'T KNOW
IF YOU WANTED TO KNOW,

30:36.875 --> 30:40.166
SO HE ASKED ME, AND I...
I'M SORRY, ADDIE.

30:41.792 --> 30:44.041
I COULDN'T NOT TELL YOU.

30:44.083 --> 30:46.000
(sighs)

30:50.458 --> 30:53.208
YOU NEED TO JUST LET IT GO,
ADDIE. OKAY? IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU.

30:53.250 --> 30:54.834
HEY. YOU LOOK WIPED.

30:54.875 --> 30:57.500
YOU SHOULD GO HOME AND POUR
YOURSELF A GLASS OF WINE.

30:57.542 --> 31:01.125
YEAH, WELL, A GLASS OF WINE'S
NOT GOING TO HELP.
YEAH, PETE'S RIGHT, ADDIE.

31:01.166 --> 31:04.625
YOU SHOULD--YOU SHOULD GO.
(cell phone rings and beeps)

31:04.667 --> 31:06.375
YEAH.
(cell phone rings)

31:08.083 --> 31:10.083
IS IT ELEANOR?

31:13.083 --> 31:15.792
SHE'S HAVING
THESE STOMACH PAINS.

31:15.834 --> 31:17.458
HER SATs ARE DROPPING.
WHAT'S WRONG?

31:17.500 --> 31:19.834
LET'S TAKE A LOOK HERE.
(Eleanor groans)

31:19.875 --> 31:23.000
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO HER?

31:23.041 --> 31:26.041
FREE FLUID IN HER ABDOMEN.
THE UTERUS IS ALMOST EMPTY.

31:26.083 --> 31:28.875
THERE'S LEAKING AROUND
THE SITE OF THE INCISION.

31:28.917 --> 31:31.041
THE BABY'S IN DISTRESS.
OKAY, ELEANOR.

31:31.083 --> 31:33.458
WE NEED TO GO BACK IN
AND REPAIR THE DEFECT

31:33.500 --> 31:36.417
AND THEN WE WILL INFUSE FLUID
BACK INTO YOUR UTERUS.

31:36.458 --> 31:38.500
PLEASE... SAVE THE BABY.
LET'S GO.

31:38.542 --> 31:41.333
SAVE THEM BOTH.

31:43.333 --> 31:46.709
FOCUS ON THE UTERINE INCISION.
WE NEED TO LOCALIZE THE LEAK.

31:46.750 --> 31:49.375
TISSUE'S NOT AS RESILIENT
AS IT WAS WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER.

31:49.417 --> 31:53.041
COULDN'T HOLD THE SEAL.
OKAY, GRAB
THE SUCTION IRRIGATOR.

31:53.083 --> 31:55.000
(suction hisses,
monitor beeps rapidly)

31:55.041 --> 31:58.000
HER RESPIRATORY RATE IS UP
AND HER SATs ARE DROPPING AGAIN.

31:58.041 --> 32:00.041
SHE'S GOING INTO FAILURE.
SHE'S FLUID OVERLOADED.

32:00.083 --> 32:03.083
WE NEED TO GET THE AMNIOTIC
FLUID OUT OF HER BELLY.

32:03.125 --> 32:05.208
500 cc's

32:05.250 --> 32:08.208
OKAY, WE NEED TO STABILIZE
HER CARDIAC FUNCTION.

32:08.250 --> 32:11.208
GIVE HER 40 OF LASIXS.
I NEED TO GET A PATCH IN NOW.

32:11.250 --> 32:12.875
(beeping continues)

32:12.917 --> 32:14.041
FOAM?

32:14.083 --> 32:15.834
(imitates buzzer)
BLOCKS SPERM.

32:15.875 --> 32:18.750
I.U.D.?
IF THEY EVER DO
WANT TO HAVE KIDS AGAIN,

32:18.792 --> 32:21.750
IT WOULDN'T BE
MY FIRST CHOICE.
HOW DOES THE FEMALE CONDOM
WORK EXACTLY?

32:21.792 --> 32:25.875
COOPER.
NO, REALLY. IT'S LIKE A BIG,
FLAPPY, MESSY MYSTERY.

32:25.917 --> 32:28.625
(laughs) WE HAVE TO BE ABLE
TO FIND SOMETHING HERE.

32:28.667 --> 32:31.041
WE CAN'T
JUST PREACH ABSTINENCE.
(chuckles)

32:31.083 --> 32:33.041
WHAT?

32:33.083 --> 32:35.834
IT'S JUST LIKE... YOU'RE JUST,
LIKE, ALL ABOUT THE SEX,

32:35.875 --> 32:38.041
JUST, LIKE,
WITH WHOMEVER, WHENEVER...
COOPER.

32:38.083 --> 32:39.959
WHATEVER
THE AGE DIFFERENCE.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.667
I MEAN, HOW LONG
DO I HAVE TO PRETEND

32:42.709 --> 32:46.041
THAT I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU
SLEPT WITH ADDISON'S FATHER?
LOOK, I'M HAPPY ABOUT THIS.

32:46.083 --> 32:49.083
I THINK IT WAS--I THINK
IT WAS REALLY GOOD FOR ME.
THAT'S GOOD.

32:49.125 --> 32:52.041
GOOD FOR YOU. BUT, YOU KNOW,
TELLING PEOPLE THINGS,

32:52.083 --> 32:54.083
TELLING THE TRUTH,
IT'S IMPORTANT.

32:54.125 --> 32:55.917
AND THAT'S A LESSON

32:55.959 --> 32:57.917
THAT THE WOMEN
IN THIS ROOM COULD LEARN.

32:57.959 --> 33:00.417
ARE YOU DONE
WITH YOUR LECTURE?

33:00.458 --> 33:03.333
'CAUSE IT'S NOT GETTING US
ANYWHERE WITH THE GOLDS.
YEAH, IT REALLY
SHOULD NOT BE THIS HARD.

33:03.375 --> 33:06.041
WELL, IT'S NOT. IT'S THE ONE
TIME WE HAVE A MAGIC PILL.

33:06.083 --> 33:08.792
DOESN'T TAKE A GENIUS TO POP
ONE OF THESE EVERY MORNING.

33:08.834 --> 33:11.291
SALT, WATER, LITTLE BIT
OF ESTROGEN--

33:11.333 --> 33:14.125
IF IT DIDN'T SAY "BIRTH CONTROL"
ON THE SIDE,

33:14.166 --> 33:17.083
THE GOLDS WOULD BE FINE
WITH IT.

33:17.125 --> 33:21.000
I THINK WE SHOULD ASK THEM
TO COME BACK IN.

33:25.083 --> 33:26.834
RONNIE.

33:26.875 --> 33:28.208
YOU'RE OKAY, EL.

33:28.250 --> 33:29.417
OH.

33:29.458 --> 33:32.208
YOU'RE OKAY.

33:32.250 --> 33:34.208
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO SEE YOUR BABY?

33:34.250 --> 33:36.000
YEAH.

33:37.834 --> 33:40.041
THE HEAD...

33:40.083 --> 33:42.083
IT'S PERFECT.

33:42.125 --> 33:43.625
(laughs)

33:43.667 --> 33:47.417
I CAN'T BELIEVE I ALMOST...
(sighs)

33:47.458 --> 33:49.667
I ALMOST TOOK THIS
AWAY FROM US.
BUT YOU DIDN'T.

33:49.709 --> 33:52.875
WHEN THINGS GOT HARD,
YOU ACTED LIKE A FATHER.

33:56.709 --> 33:59.250
ADDISON?
I GOTTA GO.

33:59.291 --> 34:01.041
EXCUSE ME.

34:01.083 --> 34:04.041
ADDISON, HEY.

34:04.083 --> 34:06.041
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?

34:06.083 --> 34:07.875
NO.

34:07.917 --> 34:10.417
YES AND NO.

34:12.709 --> 34:16.000
MY FATHER
SLEPT WITH VIOLET.

DO YOU WANT ME
TO EXPLAIN?

35:40.083 --> 35:41.959
NO.

35:47.166 --> 35:50.291
I THINK THINGS HAPPEN
FOR A REASON, PETE.

35:50.333 --> 35:52.959
AND SOMETIMES
YOU DON'T SEE THEM COMING.

35:53.000 --> 35:56.333
SOMETIMES YOU DON'T THINK
THEY COULD COME.

35:56.375 --> 35:58.000
BUT THEY DO.

35:58.041 --> 36:01.458
AND I HOPE YOU'RE NOT UPSET,
BECAUSE...

36:01.500 --> 36:03.208
I'M NOT ASHAMED.

36:03.250 --> 36:05.417
I'M HOPEFUL, ACTUALLY, AND--

36:05.458 --> 36:07.709
STOP TALKING, VIOLET.

36:07.750 --> 36:10.792
YOU'RE TALKING AS IF I CARE,
AS IF IT CONCERNS ME.

36:10.834 --> 36:13.041
BUT WHAT YOU DO--
I DON'T CARE ANYMORE.

36:13.083 --> 36:15.208
I'M DONE.

36:15.250 --> 36:17.834
(elevator bell dings)

36:17.875 --> 36:19.834
(indistinct conversations)

36:21.875 --> 36:26.834
WE HAVE ALL SORTS OF WAYS TO
HELP YOU--DEVICES, COUNSELING--

36:26.875 --> 36:29.542
IF AND WHEN YOU DECIDE
TO AVAIL YOURSELVES OF IT.

36:29.583 --> 36:32.542
BUT ULTIMATELY, THIS ISN'T
A MEDICAL DECISION.

36:32.583 --> 36:35.792
IT'S A PERSONAL ONE.

36:35.834 --> 36:38.834
SO THAT'S IT?

36:40.291 --> 36:42.583
SHAYNA.

36:48.417 --> 36:50.041
UH, RACHEL.

36:50.083 --> 36:53.959
UM, SO DR. FREEDMAN TOLD ME
HOW EXHAUSTED YOU ARE.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.041
I'LL BE OKAY.

36:56.083 --> 36:57.959
WELL, YOU'RE PROBABLY
JUST ANEMIC.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.959
IT'S VERY COMMON
IN YOUNG MOTHERS.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.333
UH, THIS SHOULD HELP.
IS THAT...

37:02.375 --> 37:05.041
AMONG OTHER THINGS, IT TREATS
IRON DEFICIENT ANEMIA.

37:05.083 --> 37:08.041
SO IF YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU NEED IT,

37:08.083 --> 37:10.959
THAT WOULD BE UP TO YOU.

37:21.250 --> 37:24.250
(children speaking indistinctly)

37:32.625 --> 37:35.834
(Rachel) OKAY, GUYS. LET'S GO.
ARE WE READY?

37:35.875 --> 37:39.417
COME ON.
COME ON, COME ON.

37:39.458 --> 37:41.542
BYE.
BYE.

37:45.458 --> 37:48.667
SOMETIMES YOU DON'T TELL
THE PERSON YOU LOVE SOMETHING

37:48.709 --> 37:50.709
TO PROTECT 'EM.

37:54.250 --> 37:56.750
I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU.

37:56.792 --> 37:58.750
WHEN YOU
SLEPT WITH MY FATHER,

37:58.792 --> 38:00.834
WHEN YOU HELPED HIM
CHEAT ON MY MOTHER,

38:00.875 --> 38:03.125
UH, WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HIM
TO MAKE HIM

38:03.166 --> 38:06.500
BEHAVE ACTUALLY LIKE
A HUMAN BEING?
ADDISON, HE IS A HUMAN BEING.

38:06.542 --> 38:10.667
ARE YOU THAT GULLIBLE, LONELY?
IS THAT IT? WHAT IS IT?
IT WASN'T LIKE THAT.

38:10.709 --> 38:12.875
SO THEN WHAT WAS IT LIKE?
TELL ME, BECAUSE OF

38:12.917 --> 38:16.041
ALL THE FACELESS, NAMELESS WOMEN
HE'S ROLLED AROUND WITH,

38:16.083 --> 38:19.000
YOU'RE THE FIRST ONE
I CAN ACTUALLY ASK.

38:19.041 --> 38:22.000
OKAY, UM, IF YOU--
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW,

38:22.041 --> 38:25.458
IT WAS, UM...
IT WAS WONDERFUL.

38:25.500 --> 38:27.458
(scoffs)
NO, I'M--I'M SORRY
IF--IF THAT HURTS YOU

38:27.500 --> 38:29.667
OR IF IT DOESN'T JIBE
WITH HOW YOU SEE HIM,

38:29.709 --> 38:31.333
BUT HE WAS KIND AND CARING.

38:31.375 --> 38:34.041
HE WAS A REAL GENTLEMAN.
HE HELPED ME.

38:34.083 --> 38:36.542
HE'S THE FIRST PERSON
IN A LONG TIME

38:36.583 --> 38:38.500
THAT MADE ME FEEL NORMAL.

38:38.542 --> 38:42.041
AND MAYBE I WAS WRONG FOR
DOING IT, MAYBE WE BOTH WERE,

38:42.083 --> 38:44.041
BUT HE'S NOT A BAD PERSON.

38:44.083 --> 38:47.000
AND I DIDN'T MEAN
TO HURT YOU, ADDISON--
WELL, BUT YOU DID IT ANYWAY.

38:47.041 --> 38:49.417
WELL, YOU TOLD PETE.
DID YOU MEAN TO HURT HIM?

38:49.458 --> 38:51.041
THAT'S DIFFERENT.

38:51.083 --> 38:53.625
BUT YOU DID IT ANYWAY.

38:53.667 --> 38:57.083
(Kate Earl's "Can't Treat Me
That Way" playing)

38:57.125 --> 38:59.500
GET OUT.
BUT, DADDY, I DON'T THINK--

38:59.542 --> 39:02.166
GET OUT OF THIS CAR,
GO IN THE HOUSE

39:02.208 --> 39:06.000
APOLOGIZE TO YOUR MOTHER
AND MEAN IT,

41:13.625 --> 41:16.583
LISTEN, IF YOU DON'T COME OUT
HERE AND TELL HER THE TRUTH,

41:16.625 --> 41:17.875
I WILL.
