00:40.623 --> 00:43.084
HECTOR
ELBA'S BROTHER

00:55.555 --> 00:56.389
That's it.

00:58.683 --> 00:59.726
Leave it there.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.732
Did Joaquin send it, son?

01:06.357 --> 01:07.275
Yes.

01:11.821 --> 01:13.865
He asked me to tell you
to have a little more patience.

01:15.116 --> 01:18.703
The elections will take place soon,
and everything will go back to normal.

01:21.331 --> 01:22.248
I hope he's right.

01:22.832 --> 01:24.959
I can't stand being locked up
in this house anymore.

01:26.169 --> 01:27.337
Did he say when I'd see him?

01:29.506 --> 01:31.007
He doesn't want you to travel
to the mountains.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.343
And for him to come to Culiacan...

01:34.719 --> 01:36.012
would be really dangerous.

01:37.055 --> 01:38.515
But he says he'll keep his promise.

01:40.433 --> 01:41.518
What promise?

01:42.852 --> 01:44.521
To be there for the girls' birth.

01:49.567 --> 01:51.444
Buy a clinic in Mexico City,

01:51.528 --> 01:53.947
with doctors, nurses, all the personnel.

01:54.531 --> 01:56.825
-A maternity clinic?
-No, a general one.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.285
It has to be small and discrete.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.830
I want Elba to give birth in Mexico.

02:03.081 --> 02:05.166
It will be easier to move around
there than in Culiacan.

02:16.386 --> 02:20.014
I feel the warmth
from my boiling blood

02:20.598 --> 02:24.769
I feel the fear, sweat dripping away

02:25.061 --> 02:29.232
There's a stillness
that nothing transmits

02:29.649 --> 02:34.779
I'm a breeze that grows stronger

02:36.239 --> 02:39.284
Even when the clouds drift away

02:40.577 --> 02:43.746
Even when my skin dries away

02:44.622 --> 02:48.251
I'll be back someday

02:49.335 --> 02:53.423
To unleash my return

02:57.927 --> 03:01.389
I have the dust that protects the road

03:02.056 --> 03:06.311
I have the branches of a leafless tree

03:06.811 --> 03:10.565
I'm the guardian of the tired night

03:11.107 --> 03:16.279
There are silhouettes that
come to meet me

03:17.614 --> 03:20.909
Even when the clouds drift away

03:21.993 --> 03:25.330
Even when my skin dries away

03:26.122 --> 03:29.667
I'll be back someday

03:30.793 --> 03:34.797
To unleash my return

03:42.138 --> 03:44.599
OFFICIAL RESIDENCE
MEXICO CITY

03:44.807 --> 03:47.977
DEAR SIR, WITH THIS LETTER
I INFORM YOU OF MY RESIGNATION

03:48.102 --> 03:50.313
FROM THE POSITION
OF SECRETARY OF PUBLIC SAFETY,

03:50.396 --> 03:52.148
WHICH I'VE PERFORMED
FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS.

03:52.232 --> 03:55.610
THIS RESIGNATION IS STRICTLY DUE
TO PROFESSIONAL REASONS.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.529
You will find out in a few
days, and I'd rather let you know myself.

04:01.282 --> 04:03.826
I will be leading the Esteban Prieto
campaign team.

04:08.581 --> 04:10.416
Son of a bitch.

04:11.793 --> 04:14.629
I was trusting in you to catch El Chapo
and win the elections.

04:14.754 --> 04:16.214
Don't judge me without a reason, sir.

04:17.131 --> 04:19.300
Not even the Navy has been able
to catch El Chapo,

04:19.425 --> 04:20.426
and they were not under my command.

04:23.638 --> 04:24.639
You think you're so smart,

04:24.722 --> 04:26.683
but you are not betting
on the winning horse.

04:27.433 --> 04:30.853
If Esteban Prieto loses,
say goodbye to your political career.

04:31.521 --> 04:33.731
It's risky, I admit it.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.985
But the risk is lower
than staying with you.

04:37.485 --> 04:38.820
As the gringos said,

04:39.404 --> 04:41.823
"The image of your party is very damaged

04:41.906 --> 04:43.700
because of your war
against drug trafficking."

04:49.163 --> 04:50.623
Good luck in the elections.

04:59.549 --> 05:01.426
Summon an emergency meeting

05:01.509 --> 05:04.012
with the command of the Armed Forces
and the Federal Police.

05:20.945 --> 05:22.030
SAFE HOUSE

05:22.155 --> 05:23.239
These are no good.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.783
When you stuff them with merch,
you can't tie the knot properly.

05:26.409 --> 05:28.828
And then, when the mule swallows them,
they'll tear.

05:29.412 --> 05:30.747
They have to be the security ones.

05:32.373 --> 05:34.709
We can lose a lot of money
if we don't do them right.

05:34.917 --> 05:35.793
Sir...

05:37.170 --> 05:38.004
Hello?

05:38.421 --> 05:39.881
I just quit.

05:40.715 --> 05:42.717
The elections are in a few months,
and I couldn't postpone it any longer.

05:42.800 --> 05:43.801
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY
MEXICO CITY

05:45.470 --> 05:46.846
Did you leave any contact in there?

05:47.096 --> 05:48.723
Someone who can let me know of the raids?

05:49.057 --> 05:50.558
No, I trust no one.

05:51.350 --> 05:53.561
The president knows very well that,
if he captures you,

05:53.644 --> 05:54.854
he'll win the elections for sure.

05:55.438 --> 05:57.356
So, now not only is the Navy
is chasing you,

05:57.440 --> 05:59.942
but also the Army and the Federal Police.

06:02.904 --> 06:03.863
What happened?

06:08.493 --> 06:09.702
Conrado just resigned.

06:11.496 --> 06:12.580
I am sorry, sir...

06:13.539 --> 06:15.708
but without his protection, I think
it's better to cancel the purchase

06:15.792 --> 06:17.251
-of the clinic in Mexico.
-No.

06:18.294 --> 06:20.046
We just have to be more careful.

06:20.254 --> 06:21.964
I won't miss my daughters' birth.

06:47.156 --> 06:50.368
-Gentlemen...
-Mr. President.

06:50.451 --> 06:51.494
...thank you for coming.

07:04.757 --> 07:06.134
I want to capture El Chapo...

07:07.260 --> 07:08.803
before the elections.

07:09.679 --> 07:10.638
ADMIRAL CORDERO

07:10.721 --> 07:11.806
We know he's
in the Triangulo Dorado mountains,

07:11.889 --> 07:13.766
but we don't know exactly where.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.978
That's his territory, and no one knows it
better than he does.

07:17.103 --> 07:19.147
That's why it's so hard to find him.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.648
If we can't find him...

07:21.357 --> 07:23.609
we have to make him come out
of his safety zone.

07:23.818 --> 07:25.570
He has a weak point
that can make him go out.

07:25.653 --> 07:27.029
COMMISSIONER OROZCO

08:14.660 --> 08:16.287
We got the location of the house.

08:21.792 --> 08:22.877
Thank you.

08:25.713 --> 08:27.006
That must be Mr. Pedro.

08:27.215 --> 08:29.634
Please tell him the geraniums
have a bug that's eating them.

08:30.092 --> 08:31.135
Yes, ma'am.

08:35.598 --> 08:36.557
Federal Police!

08:36.933 --> 08:39.018
You can't come in! Ma'am, careful!

08:39.143 --> 08:40.478
Stop there, don't move.

08:41.979 --> 08:43.856
-What do you want?
-Where is Joaquin Guzman?

08:44.232 --> 08:46.651
-You can't come in without a warrant.
-Where is your husband?

08:46.817 --> 08:49.695
You know he doesn't live here.
I haven't heard from him in years.

08:49.987 --> 08:51.697
You'll have to come
with us to the station.

08:52.031 --> 08:53.699
Call my lawyer, tell him to meet me there.

08:56.661 --> 08:57.787
What do you mean they took her away?

08:57.870 --> 08:59.664
Federal Police found the house
and took her way

08:59.747 --> 09:00.665
to the station.

09:01.249 --> 09:02.833
Motherfuckers.

09:02.917 --> 09:05.503
Fucking idiots, I'm going to fuck them up.

09:05.586 --> 09:06.420
Calm down,

09:06.504 --> 09:07.672
that's exactly what they want.

09:07.755 --> 09:09.549
They hit you where it hurts you the most
so you screw up.

09:10.883 --> 09:13.553
My informants told me that Graciela
is just declaring.

09:13.761 --> 09:15.846
She'll be back home in a couple of hours.

09:16.264 --> 09:17.890
They can't mess with my family, Ismael.

09:18.599 --> 09:20.309
If they went after Graciela,
they'll go for Elba.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.981
Graciela was caught because
she was unprotected.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.233
Elba is protected, and no one
knows where she is.

09:27.525 --> 09:29.151
Maybe, but I can't take that risk.

09:30.653 --> 09:32.655
Elba has to have a peaceful pregnancy,

09:32.738 --> 09:33.823
to give birth without any complications.

09:34.907 --> 09:35.866
What do you want to do?

09:47.378 --> 09:49.630
What's up, Ismael? How can I help you?

09:51.340 --> 09:53.593
We want you to coordinate
with the municipal police.

09:53.843 --> 09:55.511
Joaquin needs to go to Culiacan.

09:56.262 --> 09:57.972
I will help you in everything you need,

09:58.556 --> 10:00.141
but I think it's very dangerous
for him to come.

10:00.808 --> 10:03.519
Culiacan is heavily guarded,
and there are roadblocks everywhere.

10:03.769 --> 10:07.523
The municipal police can't compete against
the Navy, the Army and the Federals.

10:07.898 --> 10:09.108
I told him the same thing,

10:09.191 --> 10:10.318
but he's insisting on coming.

10:11.861 --> 10:14.447
Do whatever you need to
and wait for my signal.

10:14.864 --> 10:17.950
We need him to come in and out
without being caught.

10:19.452 --> 10:20.411
Fine.

10:24.123 --> 10:24.957
Let's go.

10:43.559 --> 10:45.227
We'll take a plane to Navolato.

10:45.436 --> 10:47.813
There, we wait until nightfall
to go into Culiacan.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.191
Move!

11:06.540 --> 11:10.544
MEXICO CITY

11:21.597 --> 11:23.182
We cannot let our guard down.

11:23.599 --> 11:26.185
If El Chapo really cares about
his family so much,

11:26.268 --> 11:28.687
what happened with his ex-wife
will make him commit a mistake.

11:49.917 --> 11:51.877
-What's up, Mariano?
-How are you?

11:52.461 --> 11:53.963
He'll take you to the city.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.507
We'll have to travel in here.

11:56.590 --> 11:58.467
It's the safest way to enter the city.

12:23.951 --> 12:27.288
STATE HIGHWAY 280
ENTRANCE TO CULIACAN

12:38.048 --> 12:39.049
I'll be right back.

12:39.175 --> 12:41.218
-Where are you going?
-It's better you don't know.

12:41.385 --> 12:42.511
I won't be long.

12:43.304 --> 12:44.346
Hector!

12:46.724 --> 12:50.102
BERNIE
QUINO'S HITMAN

12:52.062 --> 12:53.731
Everything calm in downtown.

13:04.325 --> 13:08.829
HUISACHES NEIGHBORHOOD
CULIACAN, MEXICO

13:19.006 --> 13:21.467
The oven is ready, we can start
baking the bread.

14:23.904 --> 14:25.531
Shh. Turn the light off.

14:28.158 --> 14:29.159
What are you doing here?

14:30.828 --> 14:33.789
I ordered them not to tell you,
but the police raided Graciela's house.

14:35.457 --> 14:36.417
Are they coming for me?

14:36.542 --> 14:38.210
No, but I didn't want to take any risk.

14:38.294 --> 14:39.420
Neither with you nor the girls.

14:41.755 --> 14:43.090
I want you to go to the U.S.

14:45.217 --> 14:46.635
You want me to give birth there?

14:46.719 --> 14:48.137
It's safest for the twins.

14:49.221 --> 14:51.765
You have American citizenship,
so let's take advantage of that.

15:00.107 --> 15:01.692
Federal police are on the move.

15:11.869 --> 15:13.245
It will only be for a couple of months.

15:14.538 --> 15:16.665
Until Esteban Prieto wins the elections.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.835
When that happens,
we can be together again.

15:21.378 --> 15:22.379
Promise?

15:26.175 --> 15:27.134
I promise.

15:54.745 --> 15:55.913
Take care of the girls.

16:08.342 --> 16:10.094
Stop! Don't move!

16:37.746 --> 16:41.041
They confiscated the plane in Navolato,
so we're going through Imala.

16:57.307 --> 16:58.434
Take care of your sister.

17:02.604 --> 17:03.605
Let's go!

17:15.034 --> 17:18.454

17:26.920 --> 17:32.009
FOUR MONTHS LATER

17:40.851 --> 17:43.353
What is it?

17:48.525 --> 17:49.610
Get closer.

17:50.694 --> 17:51.653
One...

17:52.154 --> 17:54.448
two... three.

17:56.366 --> 17:57.534
Nice.

18:02.498 --> 18:03.582
I sent it.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.087
Oh, yes?

18:09.338 --> 18:11.632
Look, look at this one.

18:12.174 --> 18:14.718
They are beautiful. Congratulations!

18:17.012 --> 18:18.639
Please make sure they have
everything they need.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.224
Whatever it is.

18:21.850 --> 18:22.851
Of course.

18:24.561 --> 18:26.021
Don't worry about anything.

18:26.605 --> 18:29.608
Just make sure not to get caught.
The elections will be soon.

18:30.150 --> 18:31.318
Yes, almost, man.

18:33.695 --> 18:34.905
PTI CANDIDATE ESTEBAN PRIETO
LEADS NATIONAL POLLS

18:34.988 --> 18:37.908
If this idiot wins,
I'll be able to meet my girls.

18:42.663 --> 18:44.623
The PTI candidate,
Esteban Prieto,

18:44.706 --> 18:47.543
leads the polls in the last
national results.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.921
LA PALOMA
ESTEBAN PRIETO'S WIFE

18:51.004 --> 18:53.132
These are the real results
in the national polls.

18:54.216 --> 18:55.175
OSCAR
CAMPAIGN DIRECTOR

18:55.259 --> 18:57.427
As long as we keep paying them,
the polls will keep publishing

18:57.511 --> 18:58.428
that Esteban Prieto is first.

18:59.221 --> 19:00.305
But the reality is different.

19:02.808 --> 19:05.727
Two points below first
and there's one month left.

19:07.187 --> 19:09.064
We must highlight your wife's image.

19:09.398 --> 19:11.608
She's a popular actress
and people like her.

19:12.025 --> 19:14.403
If that was the case,
we wouldn't be losing.

19:16.113 --> 19:18.991
The fairy tale between the prince
and the actress is not working out.

19:21.577 --> 19:24.246
It's clear that more spots
won't help us win the elections.

19:25.330 --> 19:27.416
We have to go to the labor union.

19:28.083 --> 19:30.419
All the candidates make deals
with the unions.

19:32.421 --> 19:34.756
Yes, but we have to offer them
something better,

19:34.840 --> 19:36.592
because right now, everything counts.

19:38.135 --> 19:40.179
I think we should attack from every angle.

19:48.103 --> 19:51.690
TRIANGULO DORADO DESERT

It's Mr. Sol.

20:26.683 --> 20:27.684
Hello?

20:30.145 --> 20:31.897
You've been missed, Conrado.

20:32.814 --> 20:35.317
The army helicopters were just here.

20:35.943 --> 20:37.194
We need your help.

20:38.111 --> 20:40.030
We have to secure votes
for Esteban Prieto.

20:40.447 --> 20:42.032
The polls say he's in first place.

20:42.366 --> 20:44.576
The polls are manipulated, Joaquin.

20:46.203 --> 20:47.746
Don't tell me that shit, Conrado.

20:48.372 --> 20:50.290
What the fuck do we have to do
to make your candidate win?

20:50.916 --> 20:53.043
Make sure the people in
the Triangulo Dorado vote for him.

21:00.884 --> 21:04.513

21:09.476 --> 21:11.853
The day of the elections
these cards will make you

21:11.937 --> 21:13.355
a very rich man, director.

21:15.190 --> 21:16.149
What are you asking in exchange?

21:16.733 --> 21:19.111
That you welcome the people
that come after the elections.

21:19.903 --> 21:23.240
They will have cards like this one,
pre-loaded with money

21:23.323 --> 21:24.616
to buy products from your store.

21:25.701 --> 21:26.576
It's a win-win situation.

21:26.660 --> 21:28.787
I don't want to be accused of
electoral fraud.

21:29.538 --> 21:32.416
That will only happen if we win,

21:33.333 --> 21:34.710
and if we win, we'll protect you.

21:36.211 --> 21:38.422
It's convenient for all of us
that the PTI gets elected.

21:39.339 --> 21:41.633
The other candidate is not good
for the economy,

21:41.717 --> 21:44.594
and Juana Vasquez, the government
candidate, hasn't got a chance.

21:44.886 --> 21:48.348
I am sorry to say this,
but a woman can't rule Mexico.

21:48.640 --> 21:49.725
Not now.

21:51.393 --> 21:52.394
Do we have a deal?

21:54.813 --> 21:56.106
Yes, we have a deal.

21:57.816 --> 21:58.817
Mr. President, good morning.

21:58.900 --> 21:59.776
Good morning.

21:59.860 --> 22:01.862
Do you think the PAD
will win the next elections?

22:01.945 --> 22:03.739
Of course we will,

22:04.323 --> 22:06.658
and if I wasn't so sure, I wouldn't be
using my free day to help Juana.

22:06.783 --> 22:07.951
Thanks a lot, Mr. President.

22:08.410 --> 22:11.288
With your help and that
of thousands of my fellow citizens,

22:11.413 --> 22:15.083
in these elections,
Mexicans will choose us,

22:15.625 --> 22:17.377
the different option.

22:17.961 --> 22:19.921
Make sure it goes out in the nightly news.

22:20.464 --> 22:23.383
Can I confirm your assistance to the
campaign meeting next week?

22:23.467 --> 22:26.470
Yes, whatever it takes for Juana
to go up in the polls.

22:29.056 --> 22:31.433
If she stays where she's at,
we have no chances of winning.

22:31.808 --> 22:33.310
Yes, sir. I'll take care of it.

22:49.659 --> 22:54.706
I WANT TO SPARE YOU A POLITICAL TRIAL.
FOR OLD TIMES' SAKE.

23:20.524 --> 23:22.067
Thanks for seeing me.

23:22.943 --> 23:25.362
What do you mean by sparing me
a political trial?

23:27.114 --> 23:29.241
You know that, no matter how much
publicity you use...

23:30.283 --> 23:32.285
your candidate won't be elected, right?

23:36.790 --> 23:38.875
If she is not elected...

23:39.876 --> 23:42.921
and my candidate isn't either,
you'll be in danger.

23:45.173 --> 23:48.093
Because the other one, the one
that is really leading the polls,

23:48.885 --> 23:51.179
has offered to open a trial against you

23:51.263 --> 23:53.390
in the name of all the victims of the war
against drugs.

24:00.313 --> 24:03.066
So the only way to save myself,
according to you...

24:04.234 --> 24:05.735
is by supporting Esteban Prieto?

24:06.903 --> 24:09.823
Maybe it's not your only choice,
but it's the safest one.

24:12.450 --> 24:15.370
We'll offer you absolute immunity.

24:34.264 --> 24:35.640
I want a guarantee

24:36.183 --> 24:39.019
that you won't even try to open
an investigative case against me.

24:39.978 --> 24:40.979
Of course.

24:43.565 --> 24:45.317
It's not convenient for me either,

24:46.443 --> 24:48.403
because at that moment you were my boss.

24:49.446 --> 24:51.323
If you get smeared, so will I.

24:54.826 --> 24:57.704
What do you want? Aside from rescinding
my support for Juana.

25:00.999 --> 25:03.251
That the Special Prosecutor's Office
for Electoral Offenses

25:03.335 --> 25:06.087
ignore any investigation
regarding vote buying.

25:08.548 --> 25:11.343
We want the budget restrictions
for the rest of the campaign removed,

25:12.636 --> 25:14.721
and that all the headquarters
of your party in the country

25:14.804 --> 25:17.265
start actively supporting Esteban Prieto.

25:26.650 --> 25:27.609
Fine.

25:32.989 --> 25:34.115
And one more thing.

25:37.160 --> 25:38.620
Stop chasing El Chapo.

25:42.290 --> 25:44.376
It will be as if you had never quit.

25:45.460 --> 25:47.462
He'll only have to worry about the Navy.

25:59.224 --> 26:01.851
Just like we won these people over
by giving them electricity,

26:02.560 --> 26:04.813
you'll go to get votes all around
the Triangulo Dorado.

26:05.814 --> 26:09.359
Repair schools, paint fences,
clean churches,

26:09.484 --> 26:11.861
make sure everybody in the towns is happy,

26:12.195 --> 26:15.991
and that they understand this is all
thanks to Esteban Prieto, got it?

26:16.241 --> 26:17.909
-Yes, sir!
-All right, move!

26:20.620 --> 26:22.163
We are going out to Surutato.

26:22.831 --> 26:26.167
Now that we only have the Navy
chasing us, things will be easier.

26:35.218 --> 26:38.596
The elections will be soon,
and we need to use our votes wisely.

26:39.764 --> 26:43.101
To whom do we owe all these supplies
and improvements in the town?

26:43.184 --> 26:45.312
Esteban Prieto!

26:45.395 --> 26:46.771
Louder! Who?

26:46.855 --> 26:48.815
To Esteban Prieto!

26:48.940 --> 26:50.859
As your mayor, I just want
the best for you.

26:50.942 --> 26:51.818
COMMUNAL MAYOR
SURUTATO, SINALOA

26:51.901 --> 26:54.612
That's why I am asking you again,

26:54.696 --> 26:56.906
to whom are we giving our votes
in these elections?

26:56.990 --> 26:59.200
To Esteban Prieto!

27:06.458 --> 27:07.751
Don't fail me, Mayor.

27:08.084 --> 27:11.629
When the results come out we will know
who helped us and who didn't.

27:14.341 --> 27:16.301
We will give these away on
election day

27:16.384 --> 27:18.303
to the workers of the Laborer's Union

27:19.179 --> 27:21.639
as long as they can prove they voted
for Esteban Prieto.

27:25.852 --> 27:28.480
And how are we going to make sure
that they voted for us?

27:29.022 --> 27:29.939
It will be a trade.

27:30.648 --> 27:32.776
They show us a photograph of the ballot,

27:33.360 --> 27:35.570
and we give them the card.

27:42.369 --> 27:46.122
Sinaloa contributes
the nine percent of the national GDP

27:46.206 --> 27:47.874
from the agricultural sector.

27:47.999 --> 27:50.085
I promise...

27:50.835 --> 27:54.798
to implement the Santa Maria Dam.

27:55.006 --> 28:00.470
I commit to implement
the two channels of the Picachos Dam,

28:00.804 --> 28:04.974
the channel of Humaya
and the Elota Piaxtla project,

28:05.183 --> 28:07.477
so Sinaloa keeps growing.

28:07.560 --> 28:08.770
Thank you very much.

28:08.895 --> 28:12.524
Esteban for president!
Esteban for president!

28:12.607 --> 28:16.236
Esteban for president!

28:16.945 --> 28:19.489
Esteban for president!

28:19.572 --> 28:21.908
Thanks a lot for the support, Jorge.

28:21.991 --> 28:24.035
You'll repay me when you become president.

28:24.119 --> 28:29.833
Esteban for president!

28:32.168 --> 28:35.130
ELECTION DAY

28:43.596 --> 28:46.474
Today is a very important day
for our country.

28:47.809 --> 28:49.644
Today will be a celebration of democracy,

28:51.396 --> 28:55.191
where we will voluntarily choose
our new president.

29:10.707 --> 29:11.958
I hope it's clear...

29:12.041 --> 29:13.209
YOUR VOTE IS
FREE AND CONFIDENTIAL

29:13.293 --> 29:15.128
...that El Chapo will know
for whom are you voting.

29:30.685 --> 29:33.605
If the PTI doesn't win,
you'll pay the consequences.

29:38.234 --> 29:39.152
This way.

29:42.489 --> 29:47.911
JUANA VASQUEZ
PRESIDENT

29:49.370 --> 29:52.957
Comrades, these supplies are to thank you
for coming to vote.

29:54.834 --> 29:57.420
Do not forget that now we are not
going to vote for Juana anymore,

29:58.588 --> 30:01.591
but for Esteban Prieto,
the candidate of the PTI.

30:03.092 --> 30:05.553
Mark this box and vote for Esteban Prieto.

30:07.263 --> 30:11.726
Mexico had an exemplary election day.

30:13.144 --> 30:18.024
Participatory, peaceful and exceptional.

30:18.942 --> 30:23.613
Today we live democracy
with absolute normality and tranquility.

30:26.699 --> 30:30.286
Thanks to all the political parties

30:30.411 --> 30:34.332
and the candidates that participated
in these elections.

30:46.719 --> 30:50.348
We have consolidated
our electoral democracy.

30:52.642 --> 30:55.937
Thanks to you, who voted.

30:57.939 --> 31:04.904
Today's election has received the most
votes in Mexico's history.

31:05.738 --> 31:10.743
All IFE systems and programs
are functioning normally,

31:10.827 --> 31:13.955
and providing us true information
in real time.

31:14.080 --> 31:17.417
Next I will give you the results
of the fast count,

31:17.500 --> 31:21.296
for the election of the president
of the United Mexican States.

31:23.673 --> 31:27.260
First place, with a vote of 38 percent,

31:27.594 --> 31:29.137
Esteban Prieto,

31:29.220 --> 31:31.014
for the Institutional Working Party.

31:32.765 --> 31:35.143
Good team, very good.

31:36.227 --> 31:38.271
-Good, very good.
-Thanks.

31:40.189 --> 31:42.108
Well done, Conrado!

31:43.151 --> 31:44.319
Fuck yeah!

31:45.778 --> 31:47.155
Thank you, thank you.

31:48.489 --> 31:49.866
Congratulations.

31:50.241 --> 31:54.203
The triumph of Esteban Prieto
marks the return of the PTI to power,

31:54.287 --> 31:56.331
for the first time in the 21st century.

31:58.583 --> 32:01.169
That's right, Alfonso,
Esteban Prieto has put the PTI

32:01.294 --> 32:04.923
back in the government after
12 years of rule by the PAD.

32:21.105 --> 32:24.233
JORGE DEL TORO RANCH

32:47.590 --> 32:48.549
My love.

32:49.759 --> 32:51.636
Darling, let me help you.

32:53.846 --> 32:55.765
Hi, my little girl.

32:58.226 --> 33:00.812
How are you? Hi there, baby.

33:02.105 --> 33:03.523
My queens.

33:08.194 --> 33:09.445
How are my girls?

33:15.743 --> 33:18.287
Hi, how are you?

33:22.333 --> 33:23.793
I was dying to meet them.

33:24.460 --> 33:25.336
So were they.

33:26.838 --> 33:28.131
They will stay in here today

33:28.673 --> 33:30.341
and you'll return to Culiacan tomorrow.

33:32.677 --> 33:33.636
Aren't you coming?

33:34.971 --> 33:36.139
Not yet, baby.

33:36.889 --> 33:38.683
I have to wait for Esteban Prieto
to take office,

33:38.766 --> 33:40.184
then I can go back.

33:41.561 --> 33:42.854
How long is that going to take?

33:44.313 --> 33:45.189
Six months.

33:50.319 --> 33:53.364
MEXICO UNITED
AGAINST AUTHORITARIANISM!

33:53.448 --> 33:56.701
Young people came out
to protest, against what they consider

33:56.784 --> 33:59.078
irregularities in the electoral process.

33:59.662 --> 34:03.583
Urgent, urgent, the president
has to resign!

34:04.959 --> 34:06.252
THE NON-CONFORMISTS

34:06.335 --> 34:07.170
MEXICO CITY

34:07.712 --> 34:08.963
DO NOT ACCEPT THE FRAUD

34:09.047 --> 34:13.468
We, with struggle and blood,
are going to defend ourselves!

34:16.054 --> 34:19.390
SIX MONTHS LATER

34:19.974 --> 34:24.103
This afternoon,
per the President-elect's orders,

34:24.228 --> 34:28.983
we've called you here for you to meet
the government cabinet.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.778
The President-elect, Esteban Prieto,

34:32.153 --> 34:37.366
will appoint Conrado Sol
as Secretary of State,

34:37.909 --> 34:43.206
who now is going to speak about
the integration of the government cabinet.

34:48.211 --> 34:49.587
Good afternoon, everyone.

34:50.630 --> 34:57.595
First, I'd like to thank
the President-elect, Esteban Prieto,

34:58.012 --> 35:00.056
for bestowing on me
the honor of this position.

35:00.723 --> 35:05.853
Now, I would like to tell you about
the men and women

35:06.604 --> 35:09.398
who will take on
the following responsibilities.

35:16.155 --> 35:17.073
Thank you very much.

35:21.160 --> 35:23.204
Welcome. Come in, please.

35:48.771 --> 35:51.566
I understand,
and I share your concerns.

35:52.942 --> 35:55.111
El Chapo has proven to be very sneaky.

35:55.736 --> 35:58.489
So much so that not even your allies
in the Navy were able to capture him.

35:58.739 --> 36:00.449
Please, be at ease.

36:01.117 --> 36:03.703
We are here to change Mexico's image.

36:04.495 --> 36:08.708
I trust Mr. Sol completely.
And don't you worry,

36:09.750 --> 36:12.378
we're going to catch Guzman.

36:25.349 --> 36:26.184
Hello?

36:26.392 --> 36:28.603
The days of hiding
are over, Joaquin.

36:30.271 --> 36:32.773
Vice-Admiral Castro is allied with us.

36:33.191 --> 36:34.775
You're no longer wanted by the Navy.

36:35.693 --> 36:36.903
And what about my deals?

36:37.320 --> 36:38.779
We're going to do as we told you:

36:39.488 --> 36:42.116
no arrest and no extradition.

36:43.576 --> 36:45.369
I hereby baptize you
in the name of the Father

36:45.453 --> 36:48.039
and of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit, amen.

36:56.088 --> 36:57.715
I hereby baptize you
in the name of the Father,

36:57.798 --> 37:00.051
the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

37:41.133 --> 37:42.301
Joaquin!

37:43.344 --> 37:44.178
Come here!

37:49.517 --> 37:53.562
I am so happy with my girl.
There she is.

38:09.662 --> 38:11.414
We're finally
as we should be, together.

38:15.251 --> 38:16.752
We're going to be
like this forever, baby.

38:20.840 --> 38:22.550
We're never going to be apart again.

38:26.887 --> 38:27.805
I swear.

39:26.405 --> 39:28.115
