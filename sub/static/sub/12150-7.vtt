00:01.929 --> 00:03.680
- Previously on Angel:
- That's her.

00:04.330 --> 00:07.950
So you're what they
brought back in that box as human.

00:08.529 --> 00:12.390
- We want him dark, not dead.
- Forces can change Angel to Angelus.

00:13.330 --> 00:15.429
He knows happiness, he goes evil.

00:15.730 --> 00:17.829
We were together 150 years.

00:18.730 --> 00:20.800
- The middle one.
- She has the sight.

00:21.129 --> 00:24.010
She is innocence.
We'll turn her into one of us.

00:24.730 --> 00:28.170
The gypsies gave you a soul.
A filthy soul! No!

00:29.530 --> 00:32.340
- I remember everything.
- You have a soul now.

00:32.530 --> 00:35.549
Soon those memories start
eating away at you.

00:36.729 --> 00:38.590
Believe me, I know.

01:03.729 --> 01:05.450
- What is it, Wesley?
- "It"?

01:05.530 --> 01:06.540
There's no it.

01:08.530 --> 01:10.459
It's nothing, really.

01:10.930 --> 01:13.909
Just popping around,
see if everything's all right.

01:15.730 --> 01:18.989
- Fine.
- Oh, good. Good.

01:19.930 --> 01:21.049
You're certain?

01:21.730 --> 01:22.640
Uh-huh.

01:22.930 --> 01:24.189
Good night.

01:25.329 --> 01:26.769
Good night.

01:28.930 --> 01:29.799
You're still here.

01:30.129 --> 01:34.659
Apparently. So you're sure there's
nothing on your mind?

01:35.530 --> 01:39.180
That is to say, nothing you'd
like to perhaps share?

01:40.930 --> 01:42.189
Nope.

01:44.530 --> 01:45.400
Really?

02:17.530 --> 02:19.000
Hello, Lindsey.

02:29.530 --> 02:31.699
- You're bleeding.
- I guess I am.

02:33.129 --> 02:35.800
- Something happened?
- Oh, God, yes.

02:36.729 --> 02:40.840
So many things, I remember them all.
Which one were you thinking of?

02:42.729 --> 02:45.750
It was too soon.
We shouldn't have sent you to him.

02:48.129 --> 02:52.169
Lindsey. You never talk
about yourself, Lindsey.

02:52.930 --> 02:56.300
Got a girlfriend? Boyfriend?

02:57.129 --> 02:58.250
Someone special?

02:59.530 --> 03:00.650
There's no one.

03:01.330 --> 03:05.020
No. No, there really isn't, is there?

03:05.530 --> 03:09.530
You can be with someone for 150 years,
think you know them.

03:11.530 --> 03:13.490
Still, doesn't work out.

03:14.530 --> 03:18.250
Angelus.
Oh, you should've seen us together.

03:18.729 --> 03:20.129
He was different then.

03:21.729 --> 03:22.960
And so was I.

03:26.530 --> 03:28.319
Do you know what we've become?

03:29.530 --> 03:30.759
Enemies.

03:31.330 --> 03:34.449
Oh, no. Much worse.

03:36.729 --> 03:39.400
Now we're soul mates.

05:04.050 --> 05:06.610
Someone close the shutters.

05:08.250 --> 05:12.670
Seems wrong that I should die
while the sun is still so bright.

05:18.449 --> 05:20.589
You'll not see it again.

05:22.050 --> 05:25.420
Before it sets,
you will have left this life.

05:27.449 --> 05:31.100
I didn't ask for a priest.
Who invited him here?

05:31.649 --> 05:34.910
You did. You cried out for me
in your delirium.

05:36.449 --> 05:37.779
I don't remember.

05:38.250 --> 05:40.180
Do you even know what I am?

05:41.250 --> 05:43.209
A woman of some property.

05:43.649 --> 05:46.319
No husband, no inheritance.

05:47.250 --> 05:49.779
Yes, I know what you are.

05:50.250 --> 05:53.800
- I'm a whore.
- Well, yes. That too.

05:54.449 --> 05:58.910
You should've asked for a priest long
ago. Your life may have been better.

05:59.850 --> 06:03.180
And you should've visited me
before today, Father.

06:04.050 --> 06:06.959
Your life may have been more
interesting for it.

06:07.649 --> 06:12.180
Are you prepared now to renounce
Satan and beg God his forgiveness?

06:13.050 --> 06:15.079
God never did anything for me.

06:16.050 --> 06:16.920
Leave us.

06:20.850 --> 06:22.990
You can't save her life.

06:23.850 --> 06:26.870
Perhaps I can still save her soul.

06:27.449 --> 06:29.730
My soul is well past saving.

06:30.449 --> 06:32.620
Let the Devil take me if he wants.

06:33.449 --> 06:35.620
Either way, I die.

06:35.850 --> 06:39.360
No, you will not die.

06:44.850 --> 06:47.339
You will be reborn.

06:49.050 --> 06:50.129
I know you.

06:50.250 --> 06:51.759
I came to you last night.

06:54.449 --> 06:57.050
I sang to you from that window.

06:58.649 --> 06:59.879
I remember now.

07:01.649 --> 07:02.699
You're Death?

07:03.449 --> 07:04.529
No.

07:06.449 --> 07:07.319
What then?

07:08.250 --> 07:10.319
I'm your savior.

07:10.649 --> 07:13.490
God never did anything for you.

07:15.449 --> 07:17.060
But I will.

07:25.410 --> 07:27.660
I think this is a really bad idea.

07:28.050 --> 07:32.620
We can't wait for Wolfram & Hart
to make a move. Let's get ahead.

07:33.449 --> 07:36.360
- Will it involve kidnapping?
- All we do is find her.

07:37.050 --> 07:41.620
This is the woman you didn't know
was in your bedroom for three weeks?

07:42.449 --> 07:44.870
- That was different.
- Different, yeah.

07:45.449 --> 07:47.269
- Cordelia has a point.
- Finally!

07:47.850 --> 07:52.029
Before, Darla wanted to be found.
Now she's out among 6 million people.

07:52.649 --> 07:54.089
She could be anywhere.

07:54.449 --> 07:58.350
We're detectives, we investigate.
That's what we're good at.

07:59.250 --> 08:01.949
It's what we suck at.
Unless there's a website:

08:02.250 --> 08:06.500
"www.Darla-is-stashed-here.com,"
we're out of luck.

08:07.410 --> 08:09.339
It's not gonna be easy.

08:11.610 --> 08:13.610
Before, he said he could smell her.

08:14.610 --> 08:17.420
How about we cruise around
with the top down...

08:17.610 --> 08:19.470
...and you take big whiffs?

08:23.009 --> 08:25.259
We'll wait until after the sun sets.

08:26.009 --> 08:28.079
Big firm, they gotta have housing.

08:28.410 --> 08:31.079
It's not as if they
flew her in from Miami.

08:31.410 --> 08:34.990
She was raised from the depths
of hell by an ancient ritual.

08:36.210 --> 08:38.629
They got to put her up.
That's an expense.

08:40.409 --> 08:43.820
You think these lawyers have
no way to write that off?

08:45.809 --> 08:50.340
- I'll examine their real estate.
- Subsidiary holdings as well.

08:51.210 --> 08:53.169
She'd want something with a view.

08:54.809 --> 08:56.809
Darla always loved a view.

08:59.090 --> 09:00.559
Angelus.

09:02.090 --> 09:05.179
The Latinate for "Angel."
It's marvelous!

09:06.289 --> 09:10.330
His name would be legend
had he left anyone alive to tell it.

09:11.090 --> 09:12.279
You had a nice trip.

09:12.889 --> 09:13.899
I'm so glad.

09:15.289 --> 09:18.340
We cut a bloody swath
through Wales and England.

09:18.889 --> 09:20.080
He was magnificent.

09:20.690 --> 09:22.440
Yorkshiremen. Tough as leather.

09:26.690 --> 09:28.789
Darla tells me you're a master.

09:29.090 --> 09:31.049
The Master. He commands our order.

09:31.490 --> 09:35.460
The Order of Aurelius.
We are the select, the elite.

09:36.289 --> 09:37.759
And you live in the sewers?

09:40.490 --> 09:43.330
We lurk below, giving tribute
to the Old Ones...

09:44.090 --> 09:46.929
...awaiting that promised day
when we will arise.

09:47.090 --> 09:50.879
Arise and lay waste
to the world above!

09:51.889 --> 09:53.750
- Why'd you want to do that?
- Huh?

09:55.490 --> 09:59.000
Well, I mean, have you
been above lately?

09:59.690 --> 10:00.559
It's quite nice.

10:00.889 --> 10:05.240
Me, I could never live in a
rat-infested stinkhole like this.

10:06.289 --> 10:09.980
Pardon me, but I gotta have
me a proper bed or I'm a terror.

10:11.090 --> 10:12.809
Isn't that right, love?

10:12.889 --> 10:14.009
He's young.

10:14.690 --> 10:17.039
And this one,
down and goose feathers...

10:17.090 --> 10:19.509
...and the finest linens.
And the view.

10:20.690 --> 10:24.730
She's always gotta have the view,
don't you, my lamb?

10:25.490 --> 10:28.539
We fed recently.
The blood is still hot in his veins.

10:29.090 --> 10:30.169
You noticed that?

10:30.289 --> 10:33.200
We stalk the surface to feed
and grow our ranks.

10:33.889 --> 10:36.659
We do not live amongst
the human pestilence.

10:37.490 --> 10:40.970
I'll be honest. You couldn't
with that face, could you?

10:42.289 --> 10:43.970
Angelus!

10:45.889 --> 10:47.710
It's not stuck like that, is it?

10:48.289 --> 10:50.460
The Master has outgrown
human features.

10:51.289 --> 10:53.220
Will I get
a bat nose like that?

10:53.690 --> 10:57.169
Few vampires are cunning enough
to have lived this long.

10:57.889 --> 11:00.419
Which you now demonstrate.

11:06.889 --> 11:09.210
Naples. You and me, Darla.
What do you say?

11:11.090 --> 11:12.320
Angelus.

11:13.490 --> 11:16.580
This is no place for you,
bound to the likes of him.

11:17.090 --> 11:18.809
You should show respect.

11:22.490 --> 11:25.929
You belong by my side.
Out in the world...

11:26.690 --> 11:29.110
...feeding as we like,
taking what we need.

11:30.289 --> 11:33.940
I'll give you that view you crave.
I'll give you everything.

11:41.090 --> 11:42.419
Tell the truth.

11:44.090 --> 11:46.759
Whose face do you wanna
look at forever?

11:48.289 --> 11:50.919
His or mine?

11:51.289 --> 11:54.620
Idiot. I made her.

12:05.090 --> 12:08.000
You're leaving with
the stallion, aren't you?

12:24.889 --> 12:27.730
No, let them go.

12:29.090 --> 12:33.659
It won't last.
I give it a century, tops.

12:35.090 --> 12:35.860
"Darla."

12:36.169 --> 12:39.049
"Anglo-Saxon derivation,
meaning 'Dear one."'

12:40.370 --> 12:44.159
Didn't come into common usage
until 100 years after her birth.

12:45.769 --> 12:47.519
He must've given it to her.

12:51.169 --> 12:53.340
I didn't even know her real name.

12:54.169 --> 12:55.179
Any luck?

12:55.370 --> 12:57.440
Not yet. Working on it.

12:59.570 --> 13:02.620
- Something will come up.
- Yes, that's my fear.

13:04.370 --> 13:07.490
Angel, your record pertaining
to Darla has been...

13:07.970 --> 13:09.860
...spotty at best.

13:10.370 --> 13:14.549
I killed her, Wesley, and she
came back. They brought her back.

13:15.769 --> 13:17.909
I need to know why. Why human?

13:18.169 --> 13:20.870
Perhaps that was the
only way they could hope...

13:21.769 --> 13:24.610
...to control her
with any degree of success.

13:24.769 --> 13:28.559
Angel, this might be why
they've brought her back.

13:30.169 --> 13:34.070
You have all your attention focused
on finding this one woman.

13:35.570 --> 13:39.610
They went through all this trouble
just to keep me distracted?

13:41.570 --> 13:44.100
It is possible.
And if that's the case....

13:45.769 --> 13:46.779
It's working.

14:01.970 --> 14:03.340
Are you hungry?

14:07.370 --> 14:10.559
I could grab some sandwiches
from the vending machine.

14:10.970 --> 14:13.570
It's not exactly
gourmet cuisine, but--

14:15.169 --> 14:16.179
Lindsey.

14:17.570 --> 14:18.409
Holland.

14:18.769 --> 14:20.029
Darla, how are you?

14:20.570 --> 14:23.100
I'm fine, Holland. Good to see you.

14:23.570 --> 14:27.120
Always a pleasure.
Lindsey, a word. You'll excuse us.

14:33.769 --> 14:35.350
I'll be right outside.

14:43.970 --> 14:46.139
I thought we were very clear on this,

14:46.970 --> 14:50.690
She's made contact.
It's not prudent to have her here.

14:51.169 --> 14:54.330
I know. I just didn't feel
I could leave her alone.

14:58.370 --> 15:01.210
There's a problem.
She shows post-traumatic--

15:01.370 --> 15:03.620
- She's cracking up.
- I wouldn't say that.

15:04.370 --> 15:05.629
She's ahead of schedule.

15:06.769 --> 15:09.259
- What?
- We'll have to accelerate matters.

15:09.769 --> 15:12.679
But we're ready.
You did the right thing. Good work.

15:13.370 --> 15:14.600
Don't let her leave here.

15:15.169 --> 15:18.149
Oh, letter openers, staple guns,
even pens...

15:18.769 --> 15:22.809
...you should remove
sharp items from your office.

15:39.250 --> 15:41.809
So beautiful.
Not a blemish, not a freckle.

15:42.850 --> 15:45.019
We should've preserved that beauty.

15:45.250 --> 15:46.509
Still, he won't now age.

15:47.049 --> 15:49.440
No, but he'll rot. Seems a pity.

15:50.049 --> 15:53.950
When I bit into him,
I could hear the ocean.

15:54.850 --> 15:56.289
Of course you could.

15:56.649 --> 15:59.490
I'm full and warm, yet all alone.

16:00.250 --> 16:03.970
- That's not true. You've got us.
- Not in the least.

16:05.049 --> 16:06.940
You won't even hurt me just a bit.

16:07.450 --> 16:09.480
- All you have to do is ask.
- No.

16:09.850 --> 16:13.750
- He's too full of you, Grandmother.
- Stop calling me that.

16:14.649 --> 16:17.529
Don't be cross. I could be your mommy.

16:18.250 --> 16:20.210
Make yourself a playmate.

16:20.649 --> 16:25.220
I could. I could pick the wisest and
bravest knight in all the land...

16:26.049 --> 16:28.330
...and make him mine forever
with a kiss.

16:31.450 --> 16:33.659
Watch where you're going!

16:36.250 --> 16:39.230
Or you could take
the first idiot that comes along.

16:41.649 --> 16:44.559
- Think she'll find a good one?
- I found you.

16:45.250 --> 16:47.210
We think that the search is over.

16:47.649 --> 16:51.200
- Property's owned by Wolfram & Hart.
- Annapolis.

16:51.850 --> 16:54.129
- A Wolfram & Hart client.
- That's slim.

16:54.850 --> 16:56.360
- It has a view.
- Not enough.

16:56.649 --> 16:59.529
- And Berber carpets.
- Narrow it down further.

17:00.250 --> 17:02.529
And my sister lives in unit 319.

17:03.250 --> 17:04.480
- You don't have one.
- I do.

17:04.450 --> 17:08.519
My older, way older, like 400 years...

17:09.848 --> 17:11.809
...older, blond sister, Darla.

17:12.250 --> 17:15.549
No last name.
I've been trying to find her...

17:15.848 --> 17:18.868
...because Mom and Dad
are in the coma.

17:19.450 --> 17:22.640
Sue, the property manager,
was very helpful.

17:24.848 --> 17:25.858
She even cried.

17:29.650 --> 17:30.519
Let's go.

17:30.849 --> 17:35.240
Perhaps I should contact Gunn.
He and I could check this out.

17:36.849 --> 17:38.599
We do the reconnaissance.

17:38.650 --> 17:41.910
Then we can all decide
how to proceed, as a team.

17:42.849 --> 17:44.430
Probably a good idea.

17:44.650 --> 17:47.210
It's 1 p.m. and that's
a Sun Valley address.

17:48.849 --> 17:50.009
Right.

17:53.650 --> 17:55.789
- Sun.
- I was thinking Valley.

17:56.049 --> 17:58.539
Why go there if you don't have to?

18:10.250 --> 18:11.119
Darla.

18:13.849 --> 18:14.970
Say that again?

18:17.450 --> 18:18.849
I just....

18:19.849 --> 18:21.220
I said your name, Darla.

18:22.849 --> 18:24.599
Sounds so odd, doesn't it?

18:25.849 --> 18:26.789
What do you mean?

18:28.250 --> 18:30.920
It wasn't my name when I was human.

18:32.450 --> 18:34.480
First time I was human, I mean.

18:36.049 --> 18:37.309
What was your name?

18:40.250 --> 18:41.690
I don't remember.

18:43.849 --> 18:46.410
I'm not her, whoever she was.

18:46.849 --> 18:49.829
I was Darla for so long.

18:50.450 --> 18:52.700
Then I wasn't.

18:53.450 --> 18:56.710
I wasn't anything. I just stopped.

18:58.250 --> 19:01.160
He killed me, I was done.

19:03.650 --> 19:05.160
Then you brought me back.

19:07.849 --> 19:08.720
Yes.

19:09.049 --> 19:10.700
What did you bring back?

19:11.450 --> 19:12.819
What am I?

19:13.849 --> 19:16.619
That girl whose name
I can't remember...

19:17.450 --> 19:19.869
...or did you bring back
something else?

19:20.450 --> 19:21.609
The other thing?

19:22.849 --> 19:24.220
Both.

19:24.650 --> 19:27.349
Neither. You're just you...

19:28.849 --> 19:31.450
- ...whatever that is.
- Why haven't you kissed me?

19:33.049 --> 19:35.009
You've been dying for it.

19:35.450 --> 19:39.000
- I didn't know if you wanted me to.
- Should that matter?

19:40.250 --> 19:43.339
Do you think I ever hesitate
when I want something?

19:43.849 --> 19:45.180
Life's too short.

19:46.250 --> 19:48.319
Believe me, I know.

19:48.650 --> 19:51.839
Four hundred years,
and still too short.

20:10.250 --> 20:13.940
That's how humans get what they want.
I remember that much.

20:16.849 --> 20:18.390
Do you like it?

20:19.250 --> 20:20.650
It's nice.

20:21.650 --> 20:23.750
It's not me you wanna screw.

20:26.450 --> 20:27.460
What?

20:28.250 --> 20:29.579
It's him.

20:30.650 --> 20:33.630
You all think you can use me
to get to Angel.

20:36.049 --> 20:37.240
Maybe.

20:43.849 --> 20:44.759
What am I?

20:45.650 --> 20:48.140
I don't know, and I don't care.

20:51.650 --> 20:54.279
- Now do you care?
- No.

20:55.250 --> 20:57.599
That's how vampires get things.
What am I?

20:57.650 --> 21:00.000
- Darla.
- Is that it? Am I Darla?

21:00.650 --> 21:01.769
Yes.

21:02.450 --> 21:07.019
Careful, Darla would snap you in half.
Is that who I am?

21:14.450 --> 21:18.420
- I know what you're going through.
- No, nobody understands.

21:19.250 --> 21:21.069
Nobody can understand.

21:22.250 --> 21:24.809
I can feel this body dying, Lindsey.

21:25.250 --> 21:27.349
I can feel it decaying every moment.

21:29.450 --> 21:31.869
It's being eaten away
by this thing inside.

21:33.650 --> 21:37.200
It's a cancer, this soul.

21:42.809 --> 21:45.059
You took him from me. You stole him.

21:45.809 --> 21:49.140
- You gave him a soul.
- He must suffer...

21:50.009 --> 21:52.920
- ...as all his victims have.
- That is no justice.

21:53.609 --> 21:55.819
Whatever pain he caused was momentary.

21:56.609 --> 21:58.289
Over in an instant...

21:59.009 --> 22:00.759
...or an hour.

22:00.809 --> 22:04.390
But what you've done will make
him suffer for eternity.

22:05.609 --> 22:08.700
Remove the filthy soul
so my boy might return to me.

22:09.210 --> 22:11.910
Angelus has gone away. Where is he?

22:12.809 --> 22:14.910
Drusilla, the camp.

22:15.809 --> 22:17.490
Go on! Kill things.

22:18.210 --> 22:19.329
He'll be very cross...

22:19.410 --> 22:22.990
...if he finds we had a lovely
slaughter without him.

22:23.609 --> 22:24.980
He'll join us soon.

22:26.009 --> 22:27.799
Now do as you're told.

22:28.410 --> 22:29.279
Okay.

22:33.210 --> 22:34.930
In that wagon is your family.

22:35.609 --> 22:38.980
Your family will die tonight
without my protection.

22:39.809 --> 22:43.250
But if you do as I say,
your family can live.

22:47.609 --> 22:48.480
What?

22:53.009 --> 22:56.660
Pretty music. Pretty, pretty music.

22:57.210 --> 22:59.880
They cry out for mercy.

23:00.809 --> 23:04.039
- They cry out for mercy.
- Show none.

23:06.809 --> 23:08.529
Did someone break in?

23:08.609 --> 23:09.839
Well, us.

23:10.410 --> 23:12.440
You guys did this? Real mature.

23:12.809 --> 23:15.970
This is the way we found it.
No forced entry evident.

23:17.009 --> 23:19.680
- Not till we got there.
- It seems she did this.

23:20.609 --> 23:22.259
She smashed all the mirrors.

23:22.410 --> 23:23.279
- Why?
- It's obvious.

23:23.609 --> 23:26.309
- It's not.
- She feels the weight of her soul.

23:27.210 --> 23:28.119
We don't know that.

23:28.410 --> 23:32.309
- She was a vampire who now has a soul.
- So why don't you smash mirrors?

23:32.609 --> 23:34.890
I don't have to look
at myself in them.

23:36.210 --> 23:37.470
We have to find her.

23:38.009 --> 23:39.339
- Angel--
- She needs help.

23:39.809 --> 23:42.509
It might be what somebody
would like you to think.

23:42.809 --> 23:45.019
- Angel.
- Cordy, just take a message.

23:45.809 --> 23:46.789
So this is a setup?

23:47.009 --> 23:48.339
- Don't rule it out.
- Angel!

23:48.809 --> 23:50.529
Cordy, please, I'm talking.

23:51.809 --> 23:53.599
Hi, Darla. He can't talk now.

23:54.210 --> 23:56.380
He'll call you back
once he's found you.

23:56.609 --> 24:00.400
- Darla?
- My boy. My darling boy.

24:02.009 --> 24:02.990
Where are you?

24:03.210 --> 24:07.779
Better question: Where was I?
I don't remember anything.

24:08.609 --> 24:10.640
It's a great big nothing,

24:11.609 --> 24:13.359
Could it be there's no hell?

24:13.410 --> 24:15.549
There's a hell, I've been to one,

24:16.410 --> 24:18.480
I told him no one could understand,

24:18.809 --> 24:21.789
But I was wrong, wasn't I?
My boy knows.

24:23.009 --> 24:25.430
- I know.
- You said you'd give me everything,

24:26.609 --> 24:29.839
Do you remember that?
I believed it then.

24:30.809 --> 24:32.250
I still do,

24:32.609 --> 24:34.119
I'll do whatever I can.

24:35.009 --> 24:38.450
It's been centuries since
I've had to be afraid.

24:38.609 --> 24:41.700
- And now I'm sick with it.
- I know.

24:44.609 --> 24:45.480
Angel.

24:45.809 --> 24:48.549
Darla, what are you doing?

24:50.009 --> 24:51.170
Help me.

24:51.210 --> 24:53.099
- Just put down the phone,
- Darla?

24:55.410 --> 24:56.740
Hang up the phone.

24:59.609 --> 25:00.619
It's okay.

25:01.410 --> 25:02.460
Darla?

25:03.809 --> 25:06.269
It's okay. All right?
Just put it down.

25:06.809 --> 25:09.369
- Everything okay?
- Yes, we're fine.

25:09.809 --> 25:12.160
- Mr. Manners told me to--
- No, leave.

25:13.410 --> 25:14.950
I have to go to him, Lindsey.

25:15.809 --> 25:16.680
Don't say that.

25:18.210 --> 25:19.369
Don't say that.

25:22.410 --> 25:26.339
- He's the only one. He can help me.
- No. I can help you too.

25:26.609 --> 25:31.000
No. No, you can't.
You don't have it in you. I'm sorry.

25:32.009 --> 25:35.309
- Let's go to Mr. Manners' office.
- I'll handle this. Go.

25:36.210 --> 25:38.210
- She's not leaving here.
- I said go!

25:41.009 --> 25:42.170
Darla?

25:44.009 --> 25:44.740
Darla?

25:49.450 --> 25:51.480
- She's not leaving here,
- I said go!

25:57.250 --> 26:00.480
Come on, let's go,
You gotta come with me,

26:04.450 --> 26:08.240
You not only allowed her to escape,
you facilitated it.

26:10.450 --> 26:12.029
Things were confusing.

26:12.849 --> 26:17.170
Things are often confusing for you.
Especially when it comes to her.

26:19.450 --> 26:22.190
You allowed yourself
to be ruled by emotions.

26:24.849 --> 26:25.789
What about the guard?

26:26.049 --> 26:30.019
Family's been notified.
Police have a suspect in custody.

26:33.250 --> 26:34.690
You're off this project.

26:36.250 --> 26:39.619
- I can find her.
- We picked her up two blocks away.

26:40.450 --> 26:41.460
She's safe?

26:43.450 --> 26:45.980
- We won't discuss it further.
- If you think--

26:46.450 --> 26:48.700
This situation has gone
out of control.

26:49.450 --> 26:50.849
I'm terminating the project.

26:51.849 --> 26:52.829
Terminating?

26:54.849 --> 26:58.289
Go home, Lindsey. Get some rest.

26:59.650 --> 27:01.049
We'll start fresh tomorrow.

27:05.049 --> 27:07.509
- Want me to come?
- I have to do this alone.

27:08.049 --> 27:09.059
- Thanks.
- Angel.

27:09.250 --> 27:11.319
I know, I could walk into a trap.

27:12.250 --> 27:13.690
- I get that.
- You don't.

27:14.049 --> 27:15.349
I can't turn my back.

27:15.849 --> 27:18.589
No, you shouldn't.
You know what she was.

27:18.849 --> 27:21.829
What we were.
I know what she's going through.

27:22.450 --> 27:25.400
Maybe she won't have to go
through it alone.

27:26.650 --> 27:27.769
You're not alone.

27:29.650 --> 27:33.019
You may be right.
She may experience this as you did.

27:33.250 --> 27:36.200
You wandered for 100 years,
never seeking redemption.

27:36.849 --> 27:38.740
That's right. I sought her.

28:04.130 --> 28:06.380
You're so warm. You've just fed.

28:07.730 --> 28:09.730
- You found me.
- You can't resist war.

28:10.130 --> 28:11.569
You always talked about China.

28:11.930 --> 28:16.279
I just followed the bodies.
You never used to be so careless.

28:17.329 --> 28:18.869
Maybe I wanted to be found.

28:20.329 --> 28:22.609
- Spike and Dru?
- They're here.

28:22.730 --> 28:24.309
Probably out in the riots.

28:25.730 --> 28:27.549
Maybe starting a new one.

28:30.529 --> 28:31.609
I should kill you.

28:32.930 --> 28:35.210
- Go ahead.
- Is that why you've come?

28:35.930 --> 28:39.480
Too much of a coward
to end your own existence?

28:40.130 --> 28:41.920
Release that filthy soul?

28:42.529 --> 28:44.000
If you like.

28:44.329 --> 28:46.220
I can still smell it, you know.

28:47.329 --> 28:48.589
That's not all.

28:49.130 --> 28:53.029
You reek of vermin. Is that
what you've been living off of?

28:53.930 --> 28:55.230
This should be nothing.

28:55.730 --> 28:59.559
Go ahead, Darla.
Make sure you cut clean to the bone.

29:05.329 --> 29:06.200
What do you want?

29:07.130 --> 29:09.519
- A second chance.
- What?

29:10.730 --> 29:12.759
I want things to be like they were.

29:13.730 --> 29:15.549
You and me together.

29:16.130 --> 29:18.380
Darla, I miss the view.

29:18.529 --> 29:21.059
- It's impossible.
- It's not impossible.

29:21.529 --> 29:23.740
- You have a soul.
- I'm still a vampire.

29:24.529 --> 29:25.650
You're not.

29:26.329 --> 29:28.720
I don't know what you are anymore.

29:29.329 --> 29:32.140
You know what I am.
You made me, Darla.

29:32.930 --> 29:34.650
- I'm Angelus.
- Not anymore.

29:35.329 --> 29:38.559
I can be again.
Give me a chance to prove it to you.

29:41.329 --> 29:43.430
You almost made me believe you.

29:43.730 --> 29:46.779
Believe it.
We can have the whirlwind back.

29:49.130 --> 29:51.829
- We can do this.
- Yes, we can.

29:52.130 --> 29:54.619
- We can do anything.
- Anything we like.

30:15.690 --> 30:16.849
Where is she?

30:17.490 --> 30:18.400
- I was--
- No.

30:18.690 --> 30:21.430
Just enough breath
to tell me where she is.

30:22.289 --> 30:23.829
We help the helpless,

30:24.089 --> 30:26.339
How can we help you? Hello?

30:27.089 --> 30:28.349
I was trying to call you.

30:28.890 --> 30:32.299
They'll kill her. Stop it.
She needs you, please.

30:32.490 --> 30:34.809
- You're a liar.
- It's true!

30:35.490 --> 30:36.359
Where?

30:37.890 --> 30:41.150
In an abandoned bank.
Wolfram & Hart's property.

30:41.490 --> 30:44.089
- I'm pretty sure that's where--
- Pretty sure?

30:45.089 --> 30:48.460
I'm not in the loop on this.
It's where they do that stuff.

30:49.289 --> 30:51.039
Where the vaults used to be.

30:51.690 --> 30:54.390
If this is a trick,
I'll come back for you.

30:56.490 --> 30:58.630
I might be back for you anyway.

31:01.289 --> 31:02.730
Darla?

31:04.890 --> 31:06.150
Darla?

31:10.890 --> 31:12.049
Darla.

31:12.690 --> 31:13.420
Darla.

31:43.890 --> 31:45.430
Angelus?

31:48.089 --> 31:50.049
The whirlwind, Angelus.

31:56.490 --> 31:57.890
- What's over here?
- Nothing.

31:58.890 --> 32:00.960
Bodies. Let's find something warm.

32:03.089 --> 32:05.410
Yes, some missionaries.

32:06.089 --> 32:08.369
We'll drain the piety
right out of them.

32:13.289 --> 32:14.450
Where have you been?

32:15.690 --> 32:18.180
- May I tell?
- No need to be humble.

32:19.289 --> 32:21.990
My little Spike just killed
himself a slayer.

32:24.089 --> 32:25.170
Did you hear that?

32:26.490 --> 32:27.289
Congratulations.

32:28.289 --> 32:30.009
That makes you one of us.

32:30.690 --> 32:32.339
Don't be so glum, mate.

32:32.490 --> 32:34.630
One slayer snuffs it,
another one rises.

32:35.490 --> 32:37.980
There's a new Chosen One
getting chosen now.

32:38.490 --> 32:43.019
When this new bird shows up,
I'll give you first crack at her.

32:46.890 --> 32:48.819
I smell fear.

32:51.089 --> 32:52.910
This whole place reeks of it.

32:54.089 --> 32:55.670
It's intoxicating.

32:55.890 --> 32:58.309
Let's go. This rebellion's boring me.

33:48.089 --> 33:51.569
Are you with me, Angel?
Why aren't you with me?

33:57.089 --> 33:59.410
Sorry, lady. It's just us.

34:09.409 --> 34:11.090
Where have you been?

34:11.809 --> 34:12.650
Darla.

34:13.010 --> 34:14.480
Answer me.

34:14.809 --> 34:15.860
Just out. Why?

34:16.610 --> 34:19.030
- Feeding?
- Yeah.

34:20.210 --> 34:21.650
On vermin?

34:23.809 --> 34:24.889
No.

34:25.610 --> 34:28.518
- Don't lie to me.
- I've killed men. You've seen it.

34:31.010 --> 34:32.690
Rapists and murderers.

34:34.610 --> 34:36.469
Thieves and scoundrels.

34:37.610 --> 34:39.539
Did you think I wouldn't notice?

34:40.010 --> 34:42.960
Only evildoers,
that's all you hunt now.

34:44.809 --> 34:49.059
You swore. You said if I took
you back, you'd prove yourself.

34:50.210 --> 34:52.000
- And I will.
- Good.

34:53.809 --> 34:54.789
Now's your chance.

35:01.610 --> 35:02.909
I went back before dawn.

35:03.409 --> 35:05.340
They were still cowering there...

35:05.809 --> 35:08.300
...praying to their God for salvation.

35:08.809 --> 35:11.550
But their only savior
was at the waterfront...

35:13.010 --> 35:14.199
...dining on rats.

35:15.409 --> 35:17.619
I won't be made a fool, Angelus.

35:18.409 --> 35:19.780
Not by you.

35:20.210 --> 35:21.079
Not by anyone.

35:22.010 --> 35:24.960
- I didn't mean--
- While Spike killed a slayer...

35:25.610 --> 35:28.000
...you were saving missionaries.

35:29.809 --> 35:31.070
From me.

35:32.809 --> 35:33.719
- I'm sorry.
- No.

35:35.809 --> 35:37.320
No more words.

35:46.010 --> 35:47.239
Act.

36:08.010 --> 36:09.239
Darla?

36:24.170 --> 36:25.539
Everything okay?

36:27.170 --> 36:28.360
Family's been notified,

36:51.769 --> 36:53.519
- Did you re-notify his family?
- Lindsey.

36:53.570 --> 36:55.039
You played me, and her.

36:55.369 --> 36:56.980
- You had to believe it.
- Why?

36:57.769 --> 36:58.780
Because she had to believe it.

36:58.969 --> 37:01.710
Angel has to.
The crisis needed to be real.

37:02.570 --> 37:05.239
You think she'll give him
that happiness?

37:06.170 --> 37:08.420
He'll come on our side? Won't happen.

37:08.570 --> 37:10.960
He'll never take advantage of her.

37:11.570 --> 37:12.869
You don't understand him.

37:13.369 --> 37:16.989
There's no prospect for intimacy.
Don't torture yourself.

37:22.369 --> 37:25.389
- What do you expect him to do?
- What he will do.

37:26.570 --> 37:28.010
What he must do.

37:28.369 --> 37:29.909
Save her soul.

37:32.650 --> 37:33.559
She'll be okay.

37:33.849 --> 37:35.710
Maybe we should get her a doctor.

37:36.849 --> 37:38.429
No doctors.

37:43.449 --> 37:44.360
Angelus.

37:47.050 --> 37:51.619
Sorry, I know you're Concussion Gal,
but around here it's Angel.

37:52.449 --> 37:54.909
Just Angel, okay?

37:55.449 --> 37:58.679
Guys, you mind?
Just give us a minute.

38:00.250 --> 38:02.210
- Yeah, of course.
- No problem.

38:08.650 --> 38:09.949
Thought I was dead.

38:11.050 --> 38:11.920
You're not dead.

38:13.449 --> 38:15.730
I'm not sure how I feel about that.

38:16.449 --> 38:17.960
I know what you mean.

38:23.050 --> 38:27.300
I'm so lucky to have
someone who understands.

38:29.050 --> 38:30.449
Who knows.

38:33.250 --> 38:35.210
That's something you never had.

38:38.650 --> 38:42.969
- Wasn't your fault.
- No, no.

38:44.050 --> 38:46.329
But there's so much that is.

38:46.449 --> 38:47.989
It's gonna be okay.

38:51.849 --> 38:53.570
I knew you'd help me.

38:54.250 --> 38:56.809
I knew if I could only get to you....

38:57.849 --> 39:00.130
Funny, that's why
they brought me back.

39:01.449 --> 39:02.960
To get to you.

39:04.449 --> 39:08.449
Now I find I need you
just as I've always needed you.

39:12.849 --> 39:15.590
You'll make the pain stop, won't you?

39:17.050 --> 39:18.420
Takes time.

39:20.050 --> 39:21.840
It takes moments.

39:23.050 --> 39:24.309
Do it.

39:25.449 --> 39:26.639
Now.

39:29.050 --> 39:30.309
What?

39:30.849 --> 39:32.219
Make me what I was.

39:33.250 --> 39:35.710
- Darla--
- You said you'd help me.

39:36.849 --> 39:38.110
I will.

39:39.849 --> 39:41.780
I want to. But not like this.

39:42.250 --> 39:44.460
Turn me back. My God!

39:45.250 --> 39:48.480
I can't bear this pounding chest
for another instant!

39:53.650 --> 39:54.769
It's a gift.

39:57.250 --> 39:59.389
To feel that heart beat...

40:00.250 --> 40:03.969
...to know really and for once
that you're alive.

40:06.250 --> 40:09.579
You're human again, Darla.
You know what that means?

40:11.650 --> 40:13.539
Of course I do.

40:14.050 --> 40:17.739
It means pain and suffering
and disease and death.

40:19.449 --> 40:23.519
I released you from this world once.
I gave you eternal life.

40:24.250 --> 40:26.320
It's time to return the favor.

40:37.449 --> 40:38.610
Favor?

40:41.650 --> 40:42.949
Is that what you think?

40:47.050 --> 40:49.300
You think you did me a favor?

40:51.849 --> 40:53.250
You damned me.

40:57.849 --> 41:01.780
If it's such a punishment,
take out your revenge. Pay me back.

41:07.449 --> 41:08.639
Please.

41:13.449 --> 41:14.849
I can't.

41:19.449 --> 41:21.099
What do you mean, you can't?

41:21.849 --> 41:23.360
You won't.

41:24.849 --> 41:27.239
I can't seem to be what I'm not.

41:29.050 --> 41:29.920
I'm sorry.

41:32.650 --> 41:34.610
You disgust me.

41:42.250 --> 41:44.039
- Darla, wait.
- No!

41:46.449 --> 41:48.309
Don't look for me again.

42:35.650 --> 42:37.510
Thank you,
