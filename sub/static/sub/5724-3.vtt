00:08.575 --> 00:10.043
You have chosen to divorce

00:10.043 --> 00:12.412
in what I like to call a humane way.

00:12.412 --> 00:14.147
[Noah] All I want is
joint custody of the kids.

00:14.147 --> 00:15.249
[Jeremy] Do you have a
physical space for them

00:15.249 --> 00:17.184
to live in at the moment?

00:17.184 --> 00:18.752
As soon as my book is finished,
I'll get the rest of my advance,

00:18.752 --> 00:20.320
and then I'll rent an apartment in the city

00:20.320 --> 00:21.555
that's big enough for all of us.

00:21.555 --> 00:22.723
So you wanna go with this ending instead?

00:22.723 --> 00:24.091
I think it's really powerful.

00:24.091 --> 00:25.425
What can I tell ya? I don't agree.

00:25.425 --> 00:26.727
[Helen] Are you living with her?

00:26.727 --> 00:28.128
[Noah] No, Helen, I'm not.

00:28.128 --> 00:29.730
I don't want her anywhere near my kids.

00:29.730 --> 00:32.198
Well, you might not get to
have everything you want, Helen.

00:32.198 --> 00:34.101
I always thought I'd be planning a wedding

00:34.101 --> 00:35.602
for the two of you after graduation.

00:35.602 --> 00:37.571
I just can't believe I finally got her.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.439
- Stop talking.
- Who the fuck are you?

00:39.439 --> 00:41.108
I'm his lawyer, Jon Gottlief.

00:41.108 --> 00:43.110
Any decisions concerning my husband's

00:43.110 --> 00:44.611

00:44.611 --> 00:46.513

New York hereby charges you

00:46.513 --> 00:48.248

[Yvonne] Oh, of course, the book.

09:17.123 --> 09:18.491
And I was living there.

09:18.491 --> 09:20.393
I mean, I always lived there. I'm a native.

09:20.393 --> 09:23.063
And I had never met a real writer before.

09:23.063 --> 09:25.698

09:34.974 --> 09:36.376

this little lighthouse

09:46.352 --> 09:49.522
right at the tip of the island.

09:49.522 --> 09:52.158

first laid eyes on each other.

09:57.297 --> 09:59.566
It was so romantic.

09:59.566 --> 10:03.236
That day in the rain.

10:03.236 --> 10:04.571
I'm enchanted. Go on.

10:04.571 --> 10:06.139

10:06.139 --> 10:09.609

a difficult time in my life.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.111
[Yvonne] Oh, no.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.379
And that day,

10:13.379 --> 10:17.584
I walked all the way out to
the lighthouse in the rain.

10:17.584 --> 10:20.687
And I was sure it'd be empty,

10:20.687 --> 10:24.687
but when I got there, I
found one other person.

10:26.693 --> 10:29.462
It was him.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.297
[Yvonne] What a beautiful story.

10:31.297 --> 10:35.101
Yes. It was somewhat unreal.

10:36.503 --> 10:39.139
What were you doing there?

10:39.139 --> 10:41.374
At the lighthouse that day in the rain.

10:41.374 --> 10:43.042
Oh, I was, um...

10:43.042 --> 10:46.112
I was researching. I was doing research.

10:46.112 --> 10:47.680
How's the book coming?

10:47.680 --> 10:49.749
It's, um... it's coming.

when you want an opinion.

10:51.718 --> 10:54.988
Oh, Noah doesn't like to share
his work until it's finished.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.289
[Yvonne] Oh, I'm sorry. Of course.

10:56.289 --> 10:57.724
No, it was rude of me to ask. I'm sorry.

10:57.724 --> 11:00.059
No, no, no. Of course, no,
I could make an exception.

11:00.059 --> 11:01.594

11:01.594 --> 11:03.196

11:16.509 --> 11:18.344
Some of them.

11:18.344 --> 11:20.046
They were all written in
the cabin you're staying in.

11:20.046 --> 11:22.248
- Really?
- Really.

11:22.248 --> 11:24.350
Since Robert and I moved
up here 20 years ago,

11:24.350 --> 11:27.220
we've hosted an author
a year, sometimes two.

11:27.220 --> 11:29.756
And most of their books
have done very, very well.

11:31.090 --> 11:32.492
[chuckles]

11:32.492 --> 11:34.427
I'm very particular about
whom I invite up here,

11:34.427 --> 11:36.095
and I don't usually take on writers

11:36.095 --> 11:38.097
I haven't personally read, but...

11:38.097 --> 11:42.035
Harry vouched so passionately for you.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.303
I tried to read your first book.

11:43.303 --> 11:44.737
I couldn't find it anywhere.

11:44.737 --> 11:47.473
That's 'cause it's out of print.

11:47.473 --> 11:48.741
Well, Harry says this second book

11:48.741 --> 11:50.443
is a big step forward anyway.

11:50.443 --> 11:52.979
I hope so. I feel kinda good about it.

11:52.979 --> 11:54.280
And you like working with Harry?

11:54.280 --> 11:55.515
Harry's great.

11:55.515 --> 11:57.383
We just can't agree on the ending,

11:57.383 --> 12:00.119
and it's driving us both a little nuts.

12:00.119 --> 12:01.988
I had a brilliant professor once tell me,

12:01.988 --> 12:04.023
"If you're having difficulty with the end,

12:04.023 --> 12:06.626
you fucked up the beginning."

12:06.626 --> 12:08.228
Oh, wonderful.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.529
I think he just meant,

12:09.529 --> 12:10.997
if you've laid all your cards out

12:10.997 --> 12:13.099
in the proper order,
the ending should flow.

12:13.099 --> 12:15.435
It should feel inevitable.

12:15.435 --> 12:17.470
At some point, fate takes over a story,

12:17.470 --> 12:21.574
and even the author himself loses control.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.209
Huh.

12:23.209 --> 12:25.211
That's, uh...

12:25.211 --> 12:27.113
never really happened to me.

12:27.113 --> 12:30.016
Tell me, what's Harry's issue with the end?

12:30.016 --> 12:32.318
Oh, I don't know, he, uh...

12:32.318 --> 12:34.053
he thinks I'm afraid to follow through

12:34.053 --> 12:36.289
on my original idea.

12:36.289 --> 12:38.258
He might be right.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.759
Would you like me to look at it?

12:39.759 --> 12:41.661
Just for another set of eyes?

12:41.661 --> 12:44.998
I wouldn't tell Harry, not even Alison.

12:44.998 --> 12:47.400
It's a very bad idea to
mix love and criticism.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.369
[laughs] Well, of course.

12:49.369 --> 12:50.670
I mean, I'd love you to.

12:50.670 --> 12:52.672
I just don't want to impose
on any more of your time.

12:52.672 --> 12:54.540
I wouldn't offer if it were an imposition.

12:54.540 --> 12:56.476
- [knock at door]
- Come in.

12:56.476 --> 12:57.710
[Yvonne] What is it, dear?

12:57.710 --> 12:59.312
Noah, can you come out here?

12:59.312 --> 13:00.613
We're in the middle of something.

13:00.613 --> 13:01.714
- I know, but...
- Well, can it wait?

13:01.714 --> 13:04.117
I don't think so.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.285
You're living in a freaking mansion?

13:05.285 --> 13:06.352
What the hell?

13:06.352 --> 13:07.220
Whitney, what are you doing here?

13:07.220 --> 13:08.454
Who's this?

13:08.454 --> 13:09.489
I'm his daughter. Who are you?

13:09.489 --> 13:11.991
Uh, Whitney, this is Yvonne, who is, uh,

13:11.991 --> 13:13.426
very generously allowing
me to stay here for a while.

13:13.426 --> 13:15.061
Yvonne, this is my daughter,

13:15.061 --> 13:17.430
who seems to have, uh,
I don't know, gone rogue.

13:17.430 --> 13:18.498
Hey, Dad, what's she doing here?

13:18.498 --> 13:20.533
I thought you weren't living together.

13:20.533 --> 13:23.303
Okay, Whit, I didn't expect you,
but you're here, so fantastic.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.737
Let's show you the cabin. Come on.

13:24.737 --> 13:26.572
Wait, ew, a cabin? Can we
just stay in your house?

13:26.572 --> 13:27.674
No. Come on. Come on. Let's go.

13:27.674 --> 13:28.741
No, why can't we just stay in this house?

13:28.741 --> 13:30.543
Can we stay here?

13:30.543 --> 13:32.178
Sorry.

13:35.548 --> 13:37.583
So what's going on, Whitney?

13:42.622 --> 13:44.324
How'd you even get here?

13:44.324 --> 13:48.194
Metro-North and then a
cab. I have street skills.

13:48.194 --> 13:50.330
Would you like something? Some water?

13:50.330 --> 13:52.298
Nice love nest.

13:52.298 --> 13:54.367
Wow, I especially like this dead fox.

13:54.367 --> 13:56.336
It's extra erotic.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.303
Does Mom know you're here?

13:57.303 --> 13:59.005
Who?

13:59.005 --> 14:00.206
Come on, cut it out.

14:00.206 --> 14:02.342
Oh, do you still call her "Mom"?

14:02.342 --> 14:04.677
Might be more appropriate
to go with a formal "Helen."

14:04.677 --> 14:07.313
Or perhaps Mrs. Solloway.
The ex-Mrs. Solloway.

14:07.313 --> 14:08.748
We're not divorced yet.

14:08.748 --> 14:11.584
Right. Hear that, Alison?
They're still married.

14:11.584 --> 14:13.519
Not like that ever stopped you.

14:13.519 --> 14:15.722
Okay, Whitney, can you at
least try to act like an adult?

14:15.722 --> 14:17.490
Sorry. I don't know any adults.

14:17.490 --> 14:18.458
How do they behave?

14:18.458 --> 14:21.594
[sighs] Whitney, just...

14:21.594 --> 14:25.594
Is that a fucking ring on her finger?

14:26.299 --> 14:28.067
Holy shit, Dad, I knew you were lame,

14:28.067 --> 14:29.736
but I didn't know you were stupid.

14:29.736 --> 14:30.737
[Noah] What are you doing?

14:30.737 --> 14:32.505
Texting Mom, your wife.

14:32.505 --> 14:34.540
- Whitney, no.
- No, stop!

14:34.540 --> 14:36.542
- [Alison] Whitney...
- Don't you fucking talk to me.

14:36.542 --> 14:38.111
Just give me that phone.
Just give me the phone!

14:38.111 --> 14:41.514
Make her take the ring
off of her fucking finger!

14:41.514 --> 14:43.649
What?

14:43.649 --> 14:46.119
You have a family. You have four kids.

14:46.119 --> 14:48.254
- I know I do. Now j...
- Then ma...

14:48.254 --> 14:50.289
- Take off the ring, bitch!
- Just stop!

14:50.289 --> 14:52.058
- [screams]
- Stop that!

14:56.662 --> 14:58.531
[Alison] I'm gonna wait outside.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.502
[sighs]

15:02.502 --> 15:06.139
[door opens and closes]

15:06.139 --> 15:08.040
Come on, Whitney.

15:11.277 --> 15:13.246
It's okay. It's all right.

15:13.246 --> 15:16.315
[crying]

15:16.315 --> 15:18.284
[crickets chirping]

15:18.284 --> 15:19.419
Here.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.020
I'm okay. Thanks.

15:25.458 --> 15:28.027
I think we're making a terrible mistake.

15:30.029 --> 15:31.531
[sighs] Please don't say that.

15:31.531 --> 15:33.299
She's right.

15:33.299 --> 15:36.269
You're not even divorced yet. Neither am I.

15:36.269 --> 15:37.537
Everything's fine here now,

15:37.537 --> 15:40.006
but what happens when we have to leave?

15:40.006 --> 15:42.542
When we actually have to
face the real world again?

15:44.343 --> 15:46.379
We'll figure it out.

15:46.379 --> 15:48.681
What if we can't?

15:48.681 --> 15:50.283
Why are you asking that?

15:50.283 --> 15:53.352
Because it's a possibility, Noah.

15:53.352 --> 15:55.121
Are you really so naive?

15:55.121 --> 15:59.158
Do you really think that things
just work out for the best?

15:59.158 --> 16:00.226
[scoffs]

16:00.226 --> 16:03.062
That true love conquers all?

16:03.062 --> 16:05.097
I can't follow you today.

16:05.097 --> 16:06.499
What does that mean?

16:06.499 --> 16:09.001
Well, one minute you're giving Yvonne

16:09.001 --> 16:11.170
some romance novel version of how we met,

16:11.170 --> 16:14.207
and now you're spouting
fucking Hegel on the deck.

16:17.510 --> 16:20.513
Did something happen while I was gone?

16:20.513 --> 16:21.581
Something you haven't told me?

16:21.581 --> 16:23.683
[chuckles]

16:23.683 --> 16:26.486
A lot of things happen
that I don't tell you.

16:33.693 --> 16:37.063
Do you really want to know things about me?

16:37.063 --> 16:41.100
Things I've never told anyone else before?

16:45.004 --> 16:48.107
[exhales] Yes.

16:48.107 --> 16:50.676
No, you don't.

16:55.248 --> 16:57.016
I slept with Oscar.

17:00.753 --> 17:01.754
Hodges?

17:01.754 --> 17:03.089
Yeah.

17:05.458 --> 17:06.425
Recently?

17:06.425 --> 17:09.595
A couple of months ago.

17:09.595 --> 17:12.598
The day you came back to Montauk actually.

17:12.598 --> 17:15.367
Okay, well...

17:15.367 --> 17:18.104
I don't love that, but it's okay.

17:18.104 --> 17:21.339
I'm not apologizing for
it. I'm just telling you.

17:21.339 --> 17:22.407
Okay.

17:29.682 --> 17:32.652
Then I tried to hurt myself.

17:32.652 --> 17:34.120
Wait, you mean you cut... you...

17:34.120 --> 17:35.988
No.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.593
I walked into the ocean.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.163
What?

17:45.998 --> 17:48.434
I wanted to drown.

17:50.503 --> 17:52.371
[sighs] Oh, God.

17:58.311 --> 18:01.447
[exhales]

18:01.447 --> 18:04.150
Come here. Come here.

18:07.453 --> 18:10.289
[kisses] Do you still feel like that?

18:13.025 --> 18:15.294
- No.
- You sure?

18:19.031 --> 18:20.766
There's nothing you can tell me

18:20.766 --> 18:23.569
that would make me give up on you.

18:23.569 --> 18:25.705
I know you don't trust a lot of people.

18:25.705 --> 18:28.174
Trust me.

18:36.549 --> 18:39.418
Cole came to visit.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.123
Here?

18:44.123 --> 18:45.491
Yeah.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.428
When?

18:49.428 --> 18:52.398
About a week ago.

18:52.398 --> 18:56.168
He came to drop off some of my things.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.307
[scoffs]

19:13.319 --> 19:17.189
I thought you said Jane
sent you those clothes.

19:18.724 --> 19:20.326
I lied.

19:25.064 --> 19:27.533
Nothing happened. We just talked.

19:38.978 --> 19:40.346
What are you doing?

19:40.346 --> 19:44.717
I'm offering you the
chance to take it back.

19:44.717 --> 19:46.052
You're a good man. You're kind.

19:46.052 --> 19:47.386
You wanna fix everyone, but I'm...

19:47.386 --> 19:49.422
Just... just stop talking for a second.

19:49.422 --> 19:51.991
I just need to think.

19:54.527 --> 19:58.364
Are you... are you trying to get rid of me?

19:58.364 --> 19:59.565
No.

19:59.565 --> 20:03.102
Are you sure?

20:03.102 --> 20:07.506
'Cause I'd understand if you were.

20:12.411 --> 20:15.281
So, if you are,

20:15.281 --> 20:17.149
you need to tell me.

20:17.149 --> 20:18.250
Just say it.

20:21.020 --> 20:23.723
Neither of us is perfect, Alison,

20:23.723 --> 20:25.357

20:25.357 --> 20:27.259
I had handled differently.

And God knows we could
spend the rest of our lives

20:33.399 --> 20:36.368

not how I want to live anymore.

20:38.037 --> 20:39.638
My whole life, I've been afraid

20:39.638 --> 20:41.507
of what other people
think of me, and I'm done.

20:41.507 --> 20:43.576
I'm just done.

20:47.413 --> 20:51.450
I want to start my life over again.

20:51.450 --> 20:54.019
With you.

20:54.019 --> 20:55.488
So, if you're not ready for that,

20:55.488 --> 20:57.757
then just, for Christ's sake,

20:57.757 --> 21:00.292
just be decent and tell me.

51:29.753 --> 51:31.522
- On the rocks?
- Sure.

51:31.522 --> 51:32.556
Be generous.

51:32.556 --> 51:35.392
And for the lady, a chamomile tea?

51:35.392 --> 51:37.661
Wild guess.

51:37.661 --> 51:39.029
Fine. Thank you.

51:39.029 --> 51:40.230
[Luke] Coming right up.

51:40.230 --> 51:42.099
Good. Sit, sit.

51:44.368 --> 51:46.270
[clears throat]

51:47.438 --> 51:48.606
Thanks.

51:48.606 --> 51:50.140
So let's get right to it, folks.

51:50.140 --> 51:52.109
My time is expensive.

51:52.109 --> 51:53.210
First thing we gotta do is get this case

51:53.210 --> 51:54.578
moved out of Montauk.

51:54.578 --> 51:56.146
They fucking hate you there.

51:56.146 --> 51:57.214
There's no way you'll get a fair trial.

51:57.214 --> 51:58.415
Can you do that?

51:58.415 --> 52:00.184
Of course I can. That's the good news.

52:00.184 --> 52:03.287
The bad news is that, unless
the grand jury surprises us,

52:03.287 --> 52:06.523
there will be a trial somewhere.

52:06.523 --> 52:09.560
So, ladies and gents,

52:09.560 --> 52:13.130
it's time to talk about that night.

52:13.130 --> 52:14.064
[door closes]

52:14.064 --> 52:16.333
Ah, perfect. Thank you, Luke.

52:17.968 --> 52:19.303
Thank you.

52:19.303 --> 52:21.238
Sit down. Take some notes.

52:25.743 --> 52:28.979
So, ahem, tell me what happened

52:28.979 --> 52:31.148
the night of Cole Lockhart's wedding.

52:31.148 --> 52:33.150
Look, I didn't kill Scott Lockhart.

52:33.150 --> 52:36.220
I am glad to hear that, Noah, but, sadly,

52:36.220 --> 52:39.256
the jury won't take my word for it, so...

52:42.126 --> 52:43.761
Uh... [exhales]

52:43.761 --> 52:45.095
it was a bad night.

52:45.095 --> 52:47.331
I didn't want to be there.

52:47.331 --> 52:49.299
It was her ex-husband, for fuck's sake,

52:49.299 --> 52:51.468
and, uh...

52:51.468 --> 52:53.537
I still don't know why
we were even invited.

52:53.537 --> 52:55.372
He was trying to be nice.

52:55.372 --> 52:57.274
- Was he?
- Yes.

53:01.111 --> 53:03.614
I was uncomfortable. I drank too much.

53:03.614 --> 53:05.382
We got into a fight.

53:05.382 --> 53:08.218
She left. I went to look for her.

53:08.218 --> 53:10.754
And I... I hit a deer.

53:10.754 --> 53:12.990
[Gottlief] You hit a deer?

53:14.258 --> 53:15.626
Yeah.

53:15.626 --> 53:18.062
Was Scott Lockhart

53:18.062 --> 53:20.097
riding the deer at the time?

53:20.097 --> 53:21.331
No.

53:21.331 --> 53:25.636
So they have you on
tape bribing a mechanic,

53:25.636 --> 53:28.739
telling the detective that
he did not fix your car

53:28.739 --> 53:30.240
the day after the wedding.

53:30.240 --> 53:32.376
I know it looks bad.

53:32.376 --> 53:34.344
Now I think I can get his testimony

53:34.344 --> 53:36.246
declared as inadmissible,
because I guarantee you,

53:36.246 --> 53:38.048
it was coerced,

53:38.048 --> 53:40.484
but that doesn't mean the jury
will forget it anytime soon,

53:40.484 --> 53:41.985
so please... [sucks in air]

53:41.985 --> 53:43.687
help me, Noah.

53:43.687 --> 53:45.322
Why the bribe?

53:48.992 --> 53:52.992
Did you know Scott Lockhart
was involved with my daughter?

53:53.097 --> 53:54.732
Yes, I'm aware of that.

53:54.732 --> 53:56.533
Well, so does everyone else.

53:56.533 --> 53:59.570
And, as you say, they don't
like me very much out there.

53:59.570 --> 54:03.273
My book wasn't exactly well received.

54:03.273 --> 54:05.609
People thought it was...

54:05.609 --> 54:08.245
exploitative.

54:08.245 --> 54:11.215
Look, I heard Scott got
killed. A hit-and-run.

54:11.215 --> 54:13.050
No suspect.

54:13.050 --> 54:15.285
And there I was, having hit a deer,

54:15.285 --> 54:17.287
which, by the way, are
everywhere in Montauk.

54:17.287 --> 54:20.591
I've got deer blood and
guts on my fucking car.

54:20.591 --> 54:22.259
So...

54:22.259 --> 54:24.061
how do you think that makes me look?

54:24.061 --> 54:27.297
You were worried you'd be
named as a potential suspect?

54:27.297 --> 54:30.234
I just wanted to keep
my name out of the press.

54:30.234 --> 54:32.636
It was idiotic. I see that now.

54:32.636 --> 54:35.272
It was a total lapse in judgment.

54:37.040 --> 54:39.009
[sighs]

54:39.009 --> 54:43.113
You know they have you on
tape threatening to kill Scott.

54:43.113 --> 54:46.116
At the Planned Parenthood.

54:46.116 --> 54:47.551
He knocked up my kid!

54:47.551 --> 54:48.619
Noah.

54:54.291 --> 54:58.291
Scott Lockhart was a low-life and a creep.

55:01.331 --> 55:03.167
And would I have liked to kill him?

55:03.167 --> 55:05.469
Of course I would, but I didn't.

55:07.271 --> 55:09.206
Because I'm a civilized human being.
