<i>Rip-Fixes-Sync
by VaVooM</i>

01:41.251 --> 01:43.502
I know I'm new in town,
but Poppy's Petals

01:43.604 --> 01:47.206
has been a staple in Santa Mesa
for nearly two decades.

01:48.809 --> 01:51.009
I know I'm not Gladys,
but she was my grandma,

01:51.112 --> 01:52.711
and she did name the shop
after me.

01:52.813 --> 01:55.447
Everything I know,
I learned from her.

01:55.549 --> 01:57.282
Well, I just know
that my flowers

01:57.384 --> 02:00.085
will make your tea party
perfectly pristine.

02:01.589 --> 02:03.188
Well, I was thinking
something elegant

02:03.290 --> 02:04.356
and monochromatic.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.592
Maybe some white poinsettias

02:06.694 --> 02:09.261
and some,
silver-painted lemon leaves.

02:09.363 --> 02:10.774
And if you wanna add
a little character,

02:10.798 --> 02:13.432
we could get
some anti-crystal vases.

02:19.507 --> 02:20.772
Okay.

02:20.875 --> 02:22.574
Okay, well, I really hope
I hear from you.

02:23.844 --> 02:25.010
Thank you,
Mrs. Darington.

02:25.112 --> 02:26.178
You okay?

02:26.280 --> 02:27.746
Yeah.

02:27.848 --> 02:30.449
Thank you. I'm-I'm just
bit of a klutz.

02:30.551 --> 02:32.618
Well, at least your phone's
in a protective case.

02:32.720 --> 02:35.320
Yeah. Thank you.

02:35.422 --> 02:37.322
Those, pine sprigs are great,

02:37.424 --> 02:39.636
but they'll break on you
if you're not careful with them.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.561
Well, I'm-I'm just
not very good at multitasking.

02:42.663 --> 02:46.165
I had to go on foot today.

02:46.267 --> 02:48.734
Sounds like you need
a delivery van.

02:48.836 --> 02:51.136
- I'm, I'm Garrett.
- I'm Poppy.

02:51.238 --> 02:52.604
Yeah, I actually have one.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.673
She's just a little cranky
today, that's all.

02:54.775 --> 02:57.876
Well, maybe, Santa can get you
a new van for Christmas.

02:57.978 --> 02:59.978
My Edna is irreplaceable.

03:00.080 --> 03:03.382
But I do have a long list
of things I need from Santa.

03:03.484 --> 03:05.918
You have a van named Edna?

03:06.020 --> 03:07.653
If you saw her,
you would understand.

03:08.656 --> 03:09.988
Okay.

03:10.090 --> 03:11.568
Well, if Edna has to stay
then what else

03:11.592 --> 03:13.692
is on the top of your,
Christmas wish list?

03:13.794 --> 03:17.062
Well, besides getting somewhere
on time for once...

03:17.164 --> 03:19.398
No, no, no, no.
That's time management.

03:19.500 --> 03:20.699
I was asking about a wish.

03:20.801 --> 03:24.336
Okay, well,
I really like churros.

03:24.438 --> 03:25.771
Now we're talking.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.773
I just happen to know a place
on the East side

03:27.875 --> 03:30.008
that has the best churros

03:30.110 --> 03:31.343
in all of Santa Mesa.

03:31.445 --> 03:32.911
Okay, well,

03:33.013 --> 03:34.613
I'll have to
check it out sometime.

03:36.684 --> 03:39.318
Can I give you a hint?

03:39.420 --> 03:40.852
I'm down that way, but,

03:40.955 --> 03:42.621
I'm happy to help out
for a few minutes

03:42.723 --> 03:44.083
in the spirit
of the giving season.

03:44.124 --> 03:45.824
You're...
Thank you. I'm okay.

03:45.926 --> 03:48.894
I'll survive,
even if the sprigs don't.

03:48.996 --> 03:50.495
- Thank you, though.
- All right.

03:50.598 --> 03:53.098
Well, good luck
with the multitasking, Poppy.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.366
It was nice meeting you.

03:54.468 --> 03:56.034
You, too...

03:56.136 --> 03:57.369
- Garrett.
- Garrett.

03:57.471 --> 03:59.905
- Merry Christmas.
- You, too.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.563
So, how did the call go?

04:24.665 --> 04:25.831
Did we get it?

04:25.933 --> 04:27.733
She's considering her options.

04:27.835 --> 04:30.335
We're an untried entity.

04:30.437 --> 04:33.505
Look, I know that Santa Mesa
can be a little snooty,

04:33.607 --> 04:35.707
but I promise you, you just get

04:35.809 --> 04:38.143
one of these Country Club
tea party ladies in your pocket

04:38.245 --> 04:40.379
and we are set and pretty.

04:40.481 --> 04:41.780
- I'm trying.
- You'll get it.

04:41.882 --> 04:44.416
- I hope so.
- You kinda have to.

04:44.518 --> 04:46.985
We just got the electric bill.

04:47.087 --> 04:49.187
And we really gotta update
this flower cooler.

04:49.290 --> 04:51.623
It is sucking down kilowatts
like there's no tomorrow.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.965
Okay. Well, my grandma opened
this shop with that cooler.

04:54.028 --> 04:57.829
Which is precisely why it's long
overdue for its retirement.

04:57.931 --> 05:00.465
I feel like all we do
is pay bills.

05:00.567 --> 05:02.067
Or not pay bills.

05:03.337 --> 05:05.203
I just wanna make pretty things

05:05.306 --> 05:06.571
and make people happy.

05:06.674 --> 05:07.806
And that is a noble

05:07.908 --> 05:10.142
and highly under-appreciated
calling.

05:10.244 --> 05:13.445
Listen, all of this
is gonna blossom real soon.

05:13.547 --> 05:15.480
- I promise you.
- I hope so.

05:15.582 --> 05:17.649
I really don't wanna
let my grandma down.

05:38.572 --> 05:40.372
- Good morning, ladies.
- Morning.

05:40.474 --> 05:41.673
Looks lovely.

05:43.277 --> 05:45.610
Okay, I am off
to the nursing home.

05:45.713 --> 05:48.180
Poppy, you can't be
doing that anymore.

05:48.282 --> 05:49.748
But it makes the residents
so happy

05:49.850 --> 05:50.994
to see pretty flowers,
and, Natalie,

05:51.018 --> 05:51.917
it's three weeks till Christmas.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.299
They deserve some holiday cheer.

05:53.387 --> 05:55.921
And we need
some paying customers.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.956
You can't give
all the flowers away.

05:58.058 --> 06:00.459
My mother always said
you have to give the world

06:00.561 --> 06:02.427
what you want it
to give back to you.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.729
So you want the world to give
you free flowers for life?

06:04.765 --> 06:07.065
No. I wanna be happy,
so I give away happy.

06:07.167 --> 06:09.034
That's what Christmas
is about, right?

06:09.136 --> 06:10.613
I wish someone would pay you
to come up

06:10.637 --> 06:12.237
with inspirational posters.

06:12.339 --> 06:14.639
Ooh, side hustle.
Let's think about it.

06:17.644 --> 06:20.879
Come on!

06:21.382 --> 06:23.048
Come on.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.751
I know it's early, Edna,

06:25.853 --> 06:28.019
but, please, come on.

06:32.126 --> 06:33.725
<i>I'm on my way.
Where you at?</i>

06:33.827 --> 06:34.827
The front of the shop.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.194
<i>Okay, don't go anywhere.</i>

06:36.296 --> 06:37.929
Very cute.

06:39.199 --> 06:40.665
Edna...

06:43.804 --> 06:46.671
- Poppy, I hate to say it...
- Then don't.

06:46.774 --> 06:49.408
- This is just a Band-Aid.
- Well, that's not bad news.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.543
I mean, Band-Aids are like
a medical marvel, right?

06:51.645 --> 06:53.779
Poppy, this old gal's
on her last leg.

06:53.881 --> 06:55.158
Yeah, well, she's gonna have to
get a crutch

06:55.182 --> 06:57.015
because this old girl
is cash-poor.

06:57.117 --> 06:58.450
Well, this'll last you

06:58.552 --> 07:00.318
a couple of weeks, at most.

07:00.421 --> 07:01.987
Where's your faith, Joe?

07:02.089 --> 07:03.199
The faith in me is charming,

07:03.223 --> 07:04.856
but I'm a mechanic,

07:04.958 --> 07:05.958
not Santa Claus.

07:07.661 --> 07:10.829
Pops, I love Edna, too...

07:10.931 --> 07:12.931
but I think it's time
to let her go.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.037
Okay. I'm going back in.

07:28.415 --> 07:30.226
Hey, do you want me to order you
something for lunch?

07:30.250 --> 07:32.851
Hey, I might go out today.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.352
You don't know.

07:34.455 --> 07:37.422
So, "Turkey club,
hold the cheese, add avocado?"

07:37.524 --> 07:39.357
Yeah, you know what?
Let's add bacon today.

07:39.460 --> 07:40.826
I'm feeling adventurous.

07:40.928 --> 07:43.495
Okay.
! Marie.

07:43.597 --> 07:47.199
These... are for you.

07:47.301 --> 07:50.168
Merry Christmas
to the best assistant ever.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.739
<i>Second row to The Nutcracker?
Thank you. How did you...</i>

07:54.842 --> 07:57.002
I heard you talking to Justine
about how your boyfriend

07:57.044 --> 07:58.477
wouldn't spring for tickets.

07:58.579 --> 07:59.589
I want you to enjoy the show.

07:59.613 --> 08:00.912
Thank you so much.

08:01.014 --> 08:03.215
<i>- Thank you.
- Merry Christmas.</i>

08:10.624 --> 08:12.858
Mrs. Darington called
while you were out on delivery.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.237
Okay, this is the part
where you smile

08:14.261 --> 08:15.405
and clap your hands
and throw confetti

08:15.429 --> 08:16.628
and say, "We got the gig".

08:16.730 --> 08:18.864
I... could do
the first three things

08:18.966 --> 08:20.665
if you want.

08:20.767 --> 08:23.535
She said they're going
with Covington Designs.

08:23.637 --> 08:26.538
Gosh.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.485
You know what I would really
like for Christmas?

08:28.509 --> 08:31.343
To never hear the word
"Covington Designs" again.

08:31.445 --> 08:32.445
Good luck with that.

08:32.546 --> 08:33.823
Why doesn't anyone want anything

08:33.847 --> 08:35.746
fresh and new in this town?

08:35.849 --> 08:38.316
Do you want the truth
or should I just wait,

08:38.418 --> 08:39.683
see where this goes?

08:39.785 --> 08:41.331
Every time I lose a gig,
it's because it goes

08:41.355 --> 08:43.488
to Covington Designs.

08:43.590 --> 08:45.023
Well, at least she let us know.

08:45.125 --> 08:48.693
I mean, she could have
kept us waiting, hoping, right?

08:48.795 --> 08:51.763
I prefer hoping, because it's...

08:51.865 --> 08:54.766
you know, hopeful.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.469
Hey, it is dogwood eats dogwood

08:57.571 --> 08:59.249
in the cut-throat world
of flower arranging.

08:59.273 --> 09:00.805
But there's no time for tears

09:00.908 --> 09:02.507
because you have
another delivery.

09:02.609 --> 09:04.442
Twelve dozen long-stem roses.

09:04.545 --> 09:07.279
Classic, romantic
and profitable.

09:07.381 --> 09:10.515
- In the name of romance.
- And profits.

09:11.418 --> 09:13.151
We carry on.

09:20.961 --> 09:24.362
No, Edna, please.

09:25.198 --> 09:27.265
No. Edna, please.

09:27.367 --> 09:28.166
Not today.

09:28.268 --> 09:30.769
Just one more delivery.

09:30.871 --> 09:32.337
Come on.

09:35.842 --> 09:36.842
Okay.

09:39.980 --> 09:40.980
<i>Hey, this is Joe.</i>

09:41.048 --> 09:41.780
<i>Leave a message.</i>

09:41.882 --> 09:43.815
Hey, Joe, it's Poppy.

09:43.917 --> 09:48.219
I'm on the corner of...
First and Hannover.

09:48.322 --> 09:50.055
The old girl is having
another flare up.

09:50.157 --> 09:51.623
Could you come quick?

09:51.725 --> 09:53.091
Thank you.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.161
Oh, Edna.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.096
Is this a sign?

10:01.168 --> 10:03.602
Am I just supposed to give up?

10:11.979 --> 10:14.245
"Five thousand dollars?"

10:16.950 --> 10:18.883
This is a sign.

10:35.602 --> 10:37.435
Yes?

10:37.537 --> 10:39.304
What did you wanna talk about?

10:42.643 --> 10:44.676
Blair, we have been
working together

10:44.778 --> 10:45.677
for 12 years now.

10:45.779 --> 10:47.245
Oh, darling,

10:47.347 --> 10:49.047
did I forget out anniversary?

10:49.149 --> 10:51.116
Forgive me,
I've just been flooded

10:51.218 --> 10:53.418
with these designs for
the governor's Christmas ball.

10:53.520 --> 10:56.655
Now, I have been with you since
you started Covington Designs

10:56.757 --> 11:00.325
and along the way I've gotten
a few offers here and there.

11:00.427 --> 11:02.127
Some enticing.

11:02.229 --> 11:04.562
But I've always believed
in your vision.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.798
Too much sentimentality.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.166
And all before noon.

11:08.268 --> 11:09.701
Now, part of what
has kept me here

11:09.803 --> 11:12.871
is the promise that one day
I might see my name

11:12.973 --> 11:14.739
above that door, too.

11:14.841 --> 11:16.007
Yes.

11:16.109 --> 11:17.742
As we reflect on the past,

11:17.844 --> 11:20.578
we also dream about the future.

11:22.082 --> 11:23.748
Well, that time is now, Blair.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.118
Time for what?

11:27.220 --> 11:29.454
Time for you
to make me a partner.

11:29.556 --> 11:32.290
And you said this would happen
last year after the holidays.

11:32.392 --> 11:34.893
And, yet, here we are again,
and nothing's changed.

11:34.995 --> 11:36.628
What gives?

11:36.730 --> 11:38.530
Garrett, you know
my intentions are good,

11:38.632 --> 11:40.098
but you can't just come in here

11:40.200 --> 11:42.100
and waylay me in the middle
of a design session.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.735
I tried to talk to you about it

11:43.837 --> 11:44.914
all the time
throughout the year,

11:44.938 --> 11:46.504
but there's always some excuse.

11:46.606 --> 11:48.373
You're too busy.

11:48.475 --> 11:50.442
It's not an excuse. It's true.

11:50.544 --> 11:52.922
Listen, if you can't give me
a clear timeline for partnership

11:52.946 --> 11:54.979
then I have to consider
other options.

11:57.384 --> 12:00.485
Don't pout. We'll come up
with an agreement.

12:00.587 --> 12:02.053
I'm serious, Blair.

12:02.155 --> 12:04.389
Listen, I appreciate
everything you've done.

12:04.491 --> 12:05.990
You know that.

12:06.093 --> 12:08.326
But I won't stay in
for less than what I deserve.

12:08.428 --> 12:11.863
That's why I'll give you
until tomorrow to decide.

12:13.667 --> 12:15.433
And if not?

12:15.535 --> 12:17.535
You'll have to accept
my resignation.

12:25.712 --> 12:27.879
I think I found a solution
to our problem.

12:27.981 --> 12:29.681
Ooh, did Santa sent us a sleigh

12:29.783 --> 12:32.350
with eight million tiny dollars?

12:32.452 --> 12:34.819
I am gonna win at the Santa Mesa
Holiday Floral Show.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.454
First prize is $5,000.

12:36.556 --> 12:37.922
Can you imagine the press?

12:38.024 --> 12:39.758
Poppy, I hate to
burst your bubble,

12:39.860 --> 12:41.392
but there is only one winner

12:41.495 --> 12:43.094
of the Santa Mesa
Holiday Floral Show,

12:43.196 --> 12:45.396
and that is Blair Covington.

12:45.499 --> 12:47.577
I thought we said that we're
never gonna say that name again.

12:47.601 --> 12:50.235
She's taken top prize
for 12 years running.

12:50.337 --> 12:51.936
Nobody can beat her.

12:52.038 --> 12:54.339
Nobody, except a young,
upstart, new,

12:54.441 --> 12:56.808
and ready to take
on the flower world by storm.

12:56.910 --> 12:59.544
Do you have any idea
what you're in for?

13:00.180 --> 13:01.646
Sit.

13:01.748 --> 13:03.148
Okay, so if you were selected

13:03.250 --> 13:04.682
as one of the ten top entries,

13:04.785 --> 13:06.384
the next three weeks
of your life

13:06.486 --> 13:09.788
are going to be consumed
by a holiday flower explosion.

13:09.890 --> 13:12.090
Three insanely intense rounds
of competition

13:12.192 --> 13:14.403
with the grand finale unfolding
at the convention center.

13:14.427 --> 13:16.261
- On Christmas Eve's eve.
- What?

13:16.363 --> 13:17.963
The day before,
the day before Christmas.

13:17.998 --> 13:19.531
Fine. I'm in.

13:19.633 --> 13:22.100
Where do I send my look book?

13:22.202 --> 13:24.169
I am loving
this can-do attitude.

13:24.271 --> 13:26.070
I'm gonna go spruce up
your entry letter.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.073
I'm gonna win this flower show.

14:39.579 --> 14:41.112
Wait, did you start without me?

14:41.214 --> 14:44.249
Just the lights.
I saved the ornaments for you.

14:46.353 --> 14:48.653
Is that my pipe cleaner Santa?

14:51.324 --> 14:53.691
You know, I remember when you
brought that home from school.

14:53.793 --> 14:56.461
You were so proud of it.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.696
And your mom's best guess was
it was a reindeer.

14:58.798 --> 15:00.509
And I burst into tears
and threw it in the trash.

15:00.533 --> 15:01.900
Yeah, but she found it,
she put it

15:02.002 --> 15:03.282
right in the middle of the tree,

15:03.370 --> 15:04.502
where everyone could see it.

15:04.604 --> 15:07.338
- Every single year.
- Yeah.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.118
You know, your mom always said
that you inherited

15:09.142 --> 15:12.076
your grandmother's
creative genius.

15:12.178 --> 15:13.578
Yeah, well, I hope
that's the truth

15:13.680 --> 15:16.414
if I'm gonna win the Santa Mesa
Holiday Floral Show.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.516
You're entering?

15:18.618 --> 15:21.452
Oh, honey, that's wonderful.

15:21.554 --> 15:22.787
Congratulations.

15:22.889 --> 15:24.622
Yeah.

15:24.724 --> 15:28.026
You know, your mom
would be so proud of you

15:28.128 --> 15:29.827
taking over the family shop
and...

15:29.930 --> 15:31.374
Well, I don't know
what I would have done

15:31.398 --> 15:32.764
if you weren't around
to help me.

15:32.866 --> 15:35.733
Well, first of all,
you'd starve.

15:35.835 --> 15:37.402
What? Dad, I can cook.

15:37.504 --> 15:39.804
Not buttered, toasted
PB and J's.

15:39.906 --> 15:41.773
Oof! That doesn't count.

15:41.875 --> 15:43.675
Who doesn't like
peanut butter and jelly?

15:43.777 --> 15:45.476
Your palate
is just underdeveloped.

15:45.578 --> 15:47.378
Oh, really?

15:47.480 --> 15:50.281
<i>Well, we'll see what you have to
say after you've had two bowls</i>

15:50.383 --> 15:53.484
of my absolutely,
amazingly delicious chili.

15:53.586 --> 15:55.486
All right.
Wait, wait, wait, one sec.

15:56.656 --> 15:57.656
Okay.

15:58.525 --> 16:00.758
Okay.

16:00.860 --> 16:02.226
Now it's really Christmas.

16:02.329 --> 16:03.594
Yeah.

16:05.265 --> 16:07.699
Now, if we could
just get some snow.

16:15.241 --> 16:16.474
Did we?

16:19.312 --> 16:20.511
You got in.

16:24.217 --> 16:25.783
I'm so excited.
Okay, but seriously,

16:25.885 --> 16:27.752
we have so much work to do.

16:27.854 --> 16:29.520
- Are you ready?
- I was born ready.

16:29.622 --> 16:30.622
Yes!

16:40.567 --> 16:42.767
Well, I'd like to say
congrats to us

16:42.869 --> 16:45.003
for getting intothliy Fw

16:45.105 --> 16:46.671
again this year.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.413
But I mean,
was it ever really a question?

16:48.475 --> 16:49.807
Nope.

16:51.044 --> 16:52.443
These are nice.

16:52.545 --> 16:54.212
Let's switch out
the, paperwhites

16:54.314 --> 16:55.213
for some amborellas.

16:55.315 --> 16:57.081
It's just more grand.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.083
Are these for an event?

16:59.185 --> 17:00.218
No, it's for the show.

17:01.321 --> 17:03.221
I design
the Holiday Floral Show.

17:03.323 --> 17:07.125
This is your opportunity
to let me step forward.

17:07.227 --> 17:09.060
Come on, your name
will still be on the booth.

17:09.162 --> 17:11.128
Yeah, that's the problem.

17:11.231 --> 17:13.164
<i>It's my name and my reputation</i>

17:13.266 --> 17:14.398
that's at stake here.

17:14.501 --> 17:15.511
Maybe next year when you've had

17:15.535 --> 17:16.666
more time to prepare.

17:16.770 --> 17:18.136
These designs are great

17:18.238 --> 17:19.537
and you know it, Blair.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.673
I don't know what your hurry is.

17:22.776 --> 17:25.209
I mean, Garrett, it's not like
you aren't deeply embedded

17:25.310 --> 17:27.645
in this company
with a very generous salary.

17:27.747 --> 17:30.181
Okay, Blair...

17:30.283 --> 17:31.449
I wanna make a deal with you.

17:31.551 --> 17:32.551
I don't make deals.

17:32.585 --> 17:34.685
I make decisions.

17:34.788 --> 17:36.320
Let me design the entrees

17:36.423 --> 17:38.022
into the floral show this year.
Okay?

17:38.124 --> 17:41.025
Just give me control,
and if I win...

17:41.127 --> 17:42.127
you make me partner.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.262
You put my name above the door.

17:44.364 --> 17:46.497
And if I lose...

17:46.599 --> 17:48.639
I'll sign a contract to work
with you for five years

17:48.735 --> 17:50.435
in any capacity you see fit.

17:50.537 --> 17:52.003
And if I say no?

17:53.573 --> 17:55.273
I walk.

17:55.375 --> 17:56.774
I'd be starting from scratch,

17:56.876 --> 17:58.487
but you and I both know
I'd have no problem

17:58.511 --> 18:00.144
making a name for myself
in this town.

18:02.549 --> 18:04.816
Well, your confidence
is inspiring.

18:09.856 --> 18:11.556
Don't disappoint me.

18:15.161 --> 18:16.161
Yes!

18:16.229 --> 18:17.595
Hello?

18:17.697 --> 18:19.263
Dad, what're you doing here?

18:19.365 --> 18:21.566
Well, I was just
driving on my way home

18:21.668 --> 18:23.801
and, I saw the lights
were still on and...

18:23.903 --> 18:26.671
- You're here late.
- Yeah. Yeah.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.884
Well, I just want everything
to be perfect for the show,

18:28.908 --> 18:30.428
so I'm trying
to get ahead of the game.

18:30.510 --> 18:32.188
Well, I brought you
some edible assistance.

18:32.212 --> 18:33.945
Little hot cocoa...

18:34.047 --> 18:36.481
and Christmas cookies.

18:37.484 --> 18:39.050
Thank you, dad.

18:39.152 --> 18:41.853
- May I see?
- Yeah.

18:41.955 --> 18:43.421
So the theme for the first round

18:43.523 --> 18:45.256
is Christmas is fun the happy.

18:45.358 --> 18:48.593
I'm doing an Edwardian fireplace
with hung stockings.

18:48.695 --> 18:51.929
- What do you think?
- Well, I think it's perfect.

18:52.031 --> 18:55.433
I was hoping for a bit more
constructive criticism, dad.

18:57.871 --> 19:00.271
Well, I'm afraid
you've come to the wrong guy,

19:00.373 --> 19:01.572
because I happen to think

19:01.674 --> 19:03.641
that everything you do
is just genius.

19:05.979 --> 19:08.346
Dad, I need to win this show.

19:08.448 --> 19:11.015
I don't know how much longer
I can keep this place afloat.

19:11.117 --> 19:13.017
Well, you know
I'll do anything to help.

19:13.119 --> 19:15.653
It's just all these bills
keep piling up

19:15.755 --> 19:17.855
while everything else
is breaking down.

19:17.957 --> 19:20.758
Poppy, let me give you
some money.

19:20.860 --> 19:23.327
No, dad, I wanna do this
on my own.

19:23.429 --> 19:25.630
Well, then we'll make it a loan.

19:26.733 --> 19:27.853
Dad, I'm not letting you dip

19:27.901 --> 19:29.133
into your retirement fund.

19:29.235 --> 19:30.835
You've already done enough.

19:30.937 --> 19:33.971
Poppy, it's what parents do.

19:34.073 --> 19:36.807
Look, I take care of you,

19:36.910 --> 19:39.610
and then someday
when I'm really old,

19:39.712 --> 19:41.445
hopefully, you won't put me
in any of those

19:41.548 --> 19:43.681
tacky Christmas sweater vests.

19:46.319 --> 19:48.085
Okay.

19:48.188 --> 19:50.521
Tsk. Thank you, dad. I love you.

19:50.623 --> 19:51.789
You're gonna come out on top

19:51.891 --> 19:53.891
because you always do.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.260
I hope so.

19:56.362 --> 19:58.162
This store depends on it.

20:08.374 --> 20:09.974
My phone.

20:10.076 --> 20:11.542
I'm so... Excuse me.

20:11.644 --> 20:13.377
Sorry about that.

20:13.479 --> 20:14.845
Hey, it's you again.

20:16.549 --> 20:17.829
You should really hire an intern

20:17.884 --> 20:19.383
to help you
with your multitasking.

20:19.485 --> 20:21.263
I feel like I'm in one of those
hidden camera shows

20:21.287 --> 20:22.565
and eventually
I'm gonna find out.

20:22.589 --> 20:24.589
I just have brilliant
comedic timing.

20:28.461 --> 20:30.861
Ooh, I'm-I'm sorry,
I'm running late.

20:30.964 --> 20:32.396
No. No problem. Me, too.

20:32.498 --> 20:34.065
I'm surprised to see you here.

20:34.167 --> 20:36.534
What, with my undying love
for pine sprigs.

20:36.636 --> 20:38.202
Is it really that implausible?

20:38.304 --> 20:39.770
No, I'm just usually
not that lucky.

20:41.274 --> 20:43.040
Listen, I'd offer to help you
carry this,

20:43.142 --> 20:44.976
but I got a feeling
I already know the answer.

20:45.078 --> 20:47.178
Yeah. One day, I'll learn.

20:47.280 --> 20:48.946
I hope I'm there when you do.

20:50.516 --> 20:52.883
I forgot my phone,
so I'm going back that way.

20:52.986 --> 20:54.552
Okay. All right,
I'll see you around.

20:54.654 --> 20:56.020
- Okay.
- Poppy.

20:58.091 --> 21:00.291
Why does he have to be
so handsome?

21:15.174 --> 21:17.608
That's Poppy,
from Poppy's Petals.

21:24.684 --> 21:27.151
- I think I met a guy.
- Ooh, do tell.

21:27.253 --> 21:29.353
I've run into him twice now...
Wait, dad, just...

21:29.455 --> 21:32.290
Left hangin' in suspense much?

21:32.392 --> 21:34.492
Poppy, tell me more.

21:37.196 --> 21:40.131
That is an impressive costume.

21:40.233 --> 21:41.932
Well, at Covington Designs

21:42.035 --> 21:43.312
we like to take
every opportunity

21:43.336 --> 21:45.169
to further the assigned theme.

21:45.271 --> 21:47.805
You work at Covington Designs.

21:47.907 --> 21:49.573
I heard they're
pretty big winners.

21:49.676 --> 21:51.309
But you better tell
that Blair Covington

21:51.411 --> 21:53.110
there is a new sheriff
in flower town.

21:54.547 --> 21:56.514
What have you heard
about Blair Covington?

21:56.616 --> 21:58.282
What haven't I heard?

21:58.384 --> 21:59.517
By the way, is she here yet?

21:59.619 --> 22:01.018
I would love
you to point her out.

22:01.120 --> 22:03.087
Just to size up my competition.

22:04.624 --> 22:06.657
I am Blair Covington.

22:09.629 --> 22:11.329
Hi.

22:11.431 --> 22:13.764
And if you want my advice,

22:13.866 --> 22:16.834
I'd, thin out
the pepper berries.

22:16.936 --> 22:19.337
Thank you so much.

22:22.442 --> 22:23.442
So that went well.

22:23.543 --> 22:24.553
Get me the pepper berries.

22:24.577 --> 22:25.577
Right.

22:34.620 --> 22:36.120
What do you think?

22:38.725 --> 22:39.990
Tsk...

22:40.093 --> 22:41.525
Well...

22:43.196 --> 22:45.096
I suppose...

22:46.632 --> 22:48.999
we'll have to let
the judges decide.

22:50.937 --> 22:53.037
I take that
as a vote of confidence.

22:56.943 --> 22:58.576
Good afternoon, judges.

22:58.678 --> 23:00.511
Miss Cromwell-Eastland.

23:00.613 --> 23:02.446
Welcome to our Edwardian
Christmas party.

23:02.548 --> 23:03.748
Hello.

23:03.850 --> 23:05.516
I am certain you will find
everything here

23:05.618 --> 23:06.984
up to the exacting standards

23:07.086 --> 23:08.219
of what you'd expect

23:08.321 --> 23:10.287
from the Fountains Abbey Estate.

23:15.795 --> 23:17.027
Lovely.

23:23.736 --> 23:25.469
Poppy's Petals.

23:25.571 --> 23:26.937
I have passed your store before.

23:27.039 --> 23:28.372
It is so cute.

23:28.474 --> 23:29.573
Thank you.

23:29.675 --> 23:31.609
Catchy name, too.

23:31.711 --> 23:33.244
- Phil and Audrey Wilson.
- Hi!

23:33.346 --> 23:34.612
- Roses Are Red Florals.
- Hi.

23:34.714 --> 23:35.813
- Bart.
- Nice to meet you.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.648
- Natalie.
- Hi. Pleasure.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.550
Team's lookin' a little thin,
don't you think?

23:41.487 --> 23:42.620
You know what?

23:42.722 --> 23:43.722
Best of luck to you guys.

23:43.823 --> 23:44.823
We'll see you.

23:45.792 --> 23:47.191
She's the mayor's daughter.

23:47.293 --> 23:48.626
Can you get me my phone?

23:48.728 --> 23:49.728
Yeah.

23:54.534 --> 23:56.066
<i>- Hey, Poppy.
- Joe?</i>

23:56.169 --> 23:57.846
<i>- She break down again?
- No, no, no. Edna's fine.</i>

23:57.870 --> 23:59.281
But I need you.
Could you come down here?

23:59.305 --> 24:01.105
<i>- On my way.
- Thank you. Bye.</i>

24:01.207 --> 24:02.673
Guys. Guys.

24:03.476 --> 24:05.743
Hi, Poppy's Petals.

24:11.884 --> 24:13.384
Enchanting.

24:41.481 --> 24:43.481
Total engine rebuild.

24:43.583 --> 24:45.549
Rush job. Got here
as quick as I could.

24:45.651 --> 24:47.362
Thank you so much, Joe,
apparently, our team

24:47.386 --> 24:49.131
was looking a little thinner
than the everyone else's.

24:49.155 --> 24:51.655
Not a problem. I got
nothing better going on now.

24:51.757 --> 24:54.692
It's always a good time to stop
and smell the roses. Right?

24:54.794 --> 24:57.228
And, yet, he shows up
covered in grease.

24:58.097 --> 24:59.263
Thanks.

24:59.365 --> 25:01.131
Always a pleasure, Nat.

25:01.234 --> 25:05.536
Welcome
to the Santa Mesa Holiday

25:05.638 --> 25:09.573
Floral Show preliminary
competition.

25:09.675 --> 25:12.676
I am Dorothy Cromwell-Eastland.

25:12.778 --> 25:14.278
And as many of you know,

25:14.380 --> 25:16.013
I am the chairwoman

25:16.115 --> 25:17.982
of the Santa Mesa

25:18.084 --> 25:21.185
Floral Beautification Committee.

25:27.093 --> 25:28.792
Thank you.

25:28.895 --> 25:30.227
Thank you. Thank you.

25:30.329 --> 25:32.263
You are far too kind.

25:32.365 --> 25:34.932
And now, without further ado,

25:35.034 --> 25:36.367
it is time to announce

25:36.469 --> 25:39.236
today's top five designers

25:39.338 --> 25:42.239
who will advance
to the semi-finals

25:42.341 --> 25:44.575
in one week.

25:44.677 --> 25:48.145
And our first semi-finalist,

25:48.247 --> 25:51.148
Poppy Benson of Poppy's Petals.

25:58.658 --> 26:00.691
Congratulations.

26:03.963 --> 26:06.163
Our second designer,

26:06.265 --> 26:09.466
Garrett Hurley
of Covington Designs.

26:17.076 --> 26:18.509
Next up,

26:18.611 --> 26:23.747
Phil and Audrey Wilson
of Roses Are Red Florals.

26:23.849 --> 26:24.982
Please come to the stage.

26:25.084 --> 26:26.884
Congratulations to all of you.

26:28.087 --> 26:29.186
What a delight.

26:29.288 --> 26:30.448
So you're the real deal, huh?

26:30.523 --> 26:33.223
- And now...
- I'm sorry?

26:33.326 --> 26:34.937
I mean, you have your own shop
and everything.

26:34.961 --> 26:37.294
I didn't realize you were
actually a floral designer.

26:37.396 --> 26:39.363
Okay, come on,
how many times have you seen me

26:39.465 --> 26:42.833
trip and pick up
foliage and flowers?

26:42.935 --> 26:45.235
I thought maybe you were
at some holiday party.

26:45.338 --> 26:47.237
Or you could be
someone's assistant.

26:48.708 --> 26:50.441
So, you work
for Blair Covington?

26:50.543 --> 26:52.042
She's my mentor.

26:52.144 --> 26:53.978
Apparently,
she's everyone's mentor.

26:54.080 --> 26:55.679
Lastly...

26:55.781 --> 26:58.315
We are so thrilled to announce

26:58.417 --> 26:59.750
that this year

26:59.852 --> 27:02.720
our semi-final theme

27:02.822 --> 27:04.955
will be...

27:05.057 --> 27:06.490
Drumroll, please.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.793
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

27:09.895 --> 27:12.930
The Twelve Days Of Christmas.

27:20.506 --> 27:22.139
Listen, it was very nice
to meet you.

27:22.241 --> 27:23.919
I just wanna let you know
that I plan on winning

27:23.943 --> 27:25.542
this entire shebang.

27:25.645 --> 27:27.177
Well, I'm sorry
to disappoint you,

27:27.279 --> 27:29.013
but not only
do I plan on winning,

27:29.115 --> 27:30.447
I am going to win.

27:31.584 --> 27:32.716
Okay, fine.

27:33.552 --> 27:34.952
Okay, fine.

27:40.026 --> 27:42.192
- Hello again.
- Hi.

27:42.294 --> 27:44.128
I heard your presentation
was a big hit.

27:44.230 --> 27:46.730
Yeah, it's, half-packed up now.

27:46.832 --> 27:49.400
- I'm really sorry I missed it.
- Oh, it's okay.

27:49.502 --> 27:52.136
Here. Here's some holly
as a consolation.

27:52.238 --> 27:54.505
Ooh.

27:54.607 --> 27:56.607
Nice outfit, by the way.
How did you get here?

27:56.709 --> 27:59.276
- In a horse and carriage?
- Yeah.

27:59.378 --> 28:01.578
Thank you.
Yeah, well, we really try to...

28:01.681 --> 28:03.547
- Further the theme.
- Further the theme. Yes.

28:03.649 --> 28:04.969
Blair mentioned that
to me earlier

28:05.017 --> 28:06.017
when she was mentoring me

28:06.118 --> 28:08.752
on how to design my booth.

28:08.854 --> 28:10.587
Well, she does have
a very keen eye.

28:10.690 --> 28:12.467
I mean, I wouldn't
totally discount her advice.

28:12.491 --> 28:13.991
You're really Team Blair,
aren't you?

28:14.093 --> 28:16.727
Twelve years and counting.

28:16.829 --> 28:18.862
That said, it helps
she is the biggest name

28:18.964 --> 28:20.297
in the flower game in this town.

28:20.399 --> 28:22.132
Well, seeing as
we're sworn enemies, I mean,

28:22.234 --> 28:24.568
do you think we should even be
having this conversation?

28:24.670 --> 28:27.905
I might unearth some invaluable
trade secrets.

28:28.007 --> 28:29.367
I don't know,
I feel like you and I

28:29.442 --> 28:31.408
can still be friends, right?

28:31.510 --> 28:33.677
We have enough in common.

28:33.779 --> 28:35.379
A fellow love of flowers

28:35.481 --> 28:37.781
is not necessarily
a fine friend to make.

28:37.883 --> 28:40.284
Well, how about
a fellow love of churros?

28:40.386 --> 28:42.319
And of costume design?

28:42.421 --> 28:43.854
And of Christmas?

28:43.956 --> 28:45.889
How about a conflict
of interest?

28:48.694 --> 28:50.894
Looks like
you're being beckoned.

28:50.996 --> 28:53.530
Right. Wish me luck.

28:53.632 --> 28:55.432
I'll see you tomorrow
at the press conference?

28:55.534 --> 28:56.433
Okay.

28:56.535 --> 28:57.801
Was that a yes?

28:57.903 --> 28:59.002
Okay.

29:25.631 --> 29:27.097
This is the real deal, huh?

29:28.234 --> 29:29.466
I am so sorry, honey,

29:29.568 --> 29:31.535
but your hair is not ready
for primetime.

29:31.637 --> 29:33.181
- We really should...
- It's fine. Just leave it.

29:33.205 --> 29:35.973
I believe in the power
of good hair.

29:36.075 --> 29:39.076
Okay, fine,
just at least put this in,

29:39.178 --> 29:40.577
so you have some sparkle.

29:40.679 --> 29:42.646
Wait, there's that guy.

29:42.748 --> 29:44.092
The cute guy
I was telling you about.

29:44.116 --> 29:45.727
- Ooh, show me.
- Don't look, he's gonna see you.

29:45.751 --> 29:47.684
Garrett Hurley.

29:47.787 --> 29:50.487
The cute guy that works
for Covington Designs?

29:50.589 --> 29:52.556
No. He had potential
to be good, right?

29:52.658 --> 29:54.558
Well, who says
this isn't giving good?

29:54.660 --> 29:56.037
Natalie, I don't need
the drama right now.

29:56.061 --> 29:57.961
I need to focus
on the competition.

29:58.063 --> 29:59.563
Well, I'd take out
a loan to cash in

29:59.665 --> 30:00.998
on that kind of distraction.

30:02.668 --> 30:04.168
Oh, my gosh. He saw me looking.

30:04.270 --> 30:06.170
Hey, think like a winner.

30:06.272 --> 30:09.239
But like a, a fragrant winner.

30:09.341 --> 30:10.941
Stop, stop doing it.

30:14.280 --> 30:15.779
Welcome to the madness.

30:15.881 --> 30:17.681
Yeah, yeah.

30:17.783 --> 30:19.427
Wasn't expecting all these
reporters to be here.

30:19.451 --> 30:21.985
The flower show
in Santa Mesa is a big deal.

30:22.087 --> 30:24.288
I mean, people go nuts for this.

30:24.390 --> 30:26.390
Blair is certainly
in her element.

30:26.492 --> 30:27.891
Isn't she stealing your thunder?

30:27.993 --> 30:29.793
Nah, it's good for the company.

30:29.895 --> 30:31.061
I don't really mind.

30:31.163 --> 30:33.463
Yeah. Same here.

30:33.566 --> 30:35.899
Hey, listen, Poppy,
just so you know,

30:36.001 --> 30:38.435
I kinda have to win
this competition.

30:38.537 --> 30:41.171
Yeah, same here.

30:41.273 --> 30:43.073
No, you don't,
you don't understand.

30:43.175 --> 30:46.743
Blair and I have an agreement,
so... have to do it.

30:46.846 --> 30:48.086
And I need to get a new cooler,

30:48.147 --> 30:50.280
so looks like
we're in the same boat.

30:50.382 --> 30:53.984
But I...
are you wearing a new perfume?

30:57.756 --> 30:59.356
Poppy! Garrett!

30:59.458 --> 31:02.960
This is Jessica Abbott
from Channel 15.

31:03.062 --> 31:06.697
I think you should speak
with her about this competition

31:06.799 --> 31:09.833
between the new girl
and the old guard.

31:17.042 --> 31:18.141
Picture time.

31:19.411 --> 31:20.477
Beautiful.

31:24.550 --> 31:25.816
Merry Christmas.

31:25.918 --> 31:26.918
I brought my best friend

31:26.986 --> 31:29.486
a healthy holiday breakfast.

31:29.588 --> 31:31.622
Croissants and...

31:31.724 --> 31:33.624
Peanut butter
with a side of jam.

31:33.726 --> 31:34.925
You are jam...

31:35.027 --> 31:36.927
I mean, you're a gem.

31:37.029 --> 31:39.463
It is a little too early
for bad jokes.

31:39.565 --> 31:42.099
Clearly, I haven't gotten out
lately,

31:42.201 --> 31:44.034
so this looks amazing.
Thank you.

31:44.136 --> 31:46.870
So, how's all the hubbub
with the flower show?

31:46.972 --> 31:49.006
Exhausting.

31:49.108 --> 31:51.575
And how's Blair handling
you being in charge?

31:51.677 --> 31:53.477
Begrudgingly.

31:53.579 --> 31:55.646
And you really
gonna go in a deal with her?

31:55.748 --> 31:57.481
I mean, it's now or never,
right?

31:57.583 --> 31:59.027
It's just like,
five years is a long time

31:59.051 --> 32:00.195
to be doing something
you don't wanna do.

32:00.219 --> 32:01.551
Yeah, but you know what?

32:01.654 --> 32:03.198
That part of the bet
doesn't really matter

32:03.222 --> 32:05.756
because I am going to win.

32:05.858 --> 32:07.591
So I saw you on the local news
last night

32:07.693 --> 32:09.426
with that cute competitor.

32:09.528 --> 32:11.228
She is totally your type.

32:11.330 --> 32:12.229
Is she?

32:12.331 --> 32:13.797
See? I knew it.

32:13.899 --> 32:15.432
- What?
- You did the eyebrow thing.

32:15.534 --> 32:17.534
That thing you do when you think
a girl's cute.

32:17.636 --> 32:19.336
Excuse me?

32:19.438 --> 32:20.637
The eyebrow doesn't lie.

32:20.739 --> 32:22.239
I've known you my whole life.

32:22.341 --> 32:24.341
Okay, fine. But you know what?

32:24.443 --> 32:25.642
Even if there was a spark,

32:25.744 --> 32:27.022
I'm pretty sure
she'd be standing by

32:27.046 --> 32:28.879
with a bucket of water
to put it out.

32:28.981 --> 32:32.082
Come on, you're cute,
and charming,

32:32.184 --> 32:34.651
and you cook, and clean,
and do your own laundry.

32:34.753 --> 32:37.054
I mean, what more
could a gal want?

32:37.156 --> 32:39.489
So, I guess she inherited her
flower shop

32:39.591 --> 32:40.657
from her grandmother,

32:40.759 --> 32:42.092
like, six months ago,

32:42.194 --> 32:44.661
and... it's not doing so well.

32:44.763 --> 32:47.531
So, I assume she's gonna use the
winnings to keep things afloat.

32:47.633 --> 32:49.666
- Complicated indeed.
- Yeah.

32:49.768 --> 32:51.528
I mean, basically,
if I win everything I want

32:51.603 --> 32:53.170
she loses everything she wants.

32:53.272 --> 32:56.373
Well, what if I told you
I could help you out

32:56.475 --> 32:58.275
with your romantic endeavors?

32:59.678 --> 33:00.944
What are you talking about?

33:01.046 --> 33:03.213
Well, mother's
Annual Christmas Fete

33:03.315 --> 33:05.415
is coming up,
and we need to hire a florist.

33:05.517 --> 33:08.151
We'd usually use that
Garrett what's-his-name,

33:08.253 --> 33:10.721
but, I heard there's
a new up-and-coming florist

33:10.823 --> 33:12.089
who might be worth a shot.

33:12.191 --> 33:16.126
Tiffany Daniels,
you are a peach.

33:16.228 --> 33:18.395
And the best friend anybody
could ever ask for.

33:18.497 --> 33:19.730
How can I ever repay you?

33:19.832 --> 33:21.999
Insanely expensive shoes
for my birthday

33:22.101 --> 33:23.734
will do just fine.

33:24.737 --> 33:25.769
Okay.

33:34.847 --> 33:36.113
Okay.

33:37.282 --> 33:38.715
Yes.

33:38.817 --> 33:40.150
Okay, thank you.

33:41.020 --> 33:42.586
Okay, bye.

33:44.723 --> 33:46.023
Guess who just booked a big gig.

33:46.125 --> 33:47.591
Blair Covington?

33:47.693 --> 33:49.004
Too soon? I'm kidding,
I'm kidding.

33:49.028 --> 33:50.338
I'm so excited.
Tell me everything.

33:50.362 --> 33:51.261
Okay, so it's a massive

33:51.363 --> 33:52.262
society Christmas party

33:52.364 --> 33:53.964
with a 150 invites,

33:54.066 --> 33:55.510
and they want center pieces
for all the tables.

33:55.534 --> 33:57.067
We're gonna need a big order.

33:57.169 --> 33:58.869
No, huge order. Giant order.

33:58.971 --> 34:01.605
I was told, "Spare no expense".

34:01.707 --> 34:03.840
My three favorite words
in the English language.

34:03.942 --> 34:06.209
Are we gonna have time
to do both?

34:06.311 --> 34:07.878
- Both?
- Hello.

34:07.980 --> 34:09.090
The semi-finals round
of the competition

34:09.114 --> 34:10.114
is tomorrow.

34:10.215 --> 34:12.014
Of course. I'm all over it.

34:12.117 --> 34:13.476
When there's a will,
there's a way.

34:13.552 --> 34:15.485
Now that's the Christmas spirit.

34:15.587 --> 34:17.521
Okay, so about this
society party,

34:17.623 --> 34:19.034
I was thinking
we should do something modern

34:19.058 --> 34:21.824
like, I've been wanting to use
Indonesian eucalyptus.

34:21.927 --> 34:22.826
What do you think?

34:22.928 --> 34:25.395
International flair. I like.

34:25.496 --> 34:28.965
Yeah. Maybe, like, with some
Christmassy red ombre flowers.

34:29.068 --> 34:31.101
Yes. Poppy, that is it.

34:31.203 --> 34:32.636
You're in.

34:32.737 --> 34:35.472
And in celebration of this
very momentous moment...

34:35.574 --> 34:36.873
I'm gonna pay the electric bill.

34:36.975 --> 34:37.975
Yes!

35:21.220 --> 35:23.987
I thought you were coming
as a little drummer boy.

35:24.089 --> 35:26.456
You know, I don't think
I need to wear a costume.

35:26.558 --> 35:28.558
I feel like the design
speaks for itself.

35:28.660 --> 35:31.695
Careful attention
to the theme...

35:31.797 --> 35:33.530
is part of the reason
that Covington Designs

35:33.632 --> 35:37.434
has won this flower show
for the last 12 years.

35:37.536 --> 35:39.569
Is there nothing to be said
for tradition?

35:39.671 --> 35:42.405
I understand that
it's your tradition, Blair,

35:42.508 --> 35:44.419
but I thought you said we could
try things my way

35:44.443 --> 35:45.709
this time around.

35:45.811 --> 35:47.811
I do wish the best for you,
Garrett.

35:47.913 --> 35:49.446
But I must admit

35:49.548 --> 35:53.116
that it's things like this that
do cause my confidence to waver.

35:55.220 --> 35:58.021
Look, I need you to understand

35:58.123 --> 35:59.890
I was taught by the best.

35:59.992 --> 36:03.493
But now it's time for the master
to let her pupil shine.

36:05.631 --> 36:07.464
Fine. Fine.

36:08.867 --> 36:10.667
But you better shine.

36:14.173 --> 36:16.406
Poppy, we're gonna get a drink.
Do you want something?

36:16.508 --> 36:18.308
- No, I'm okay. Thanks, dad.
- Yeah? Okay.

36:18.410 --> 36:19.442
Nat?

36:28.921 --> 36:30.887
Hello there, fellow competitor.

36:30.989 --> 36:33.356
You're so formal.

36:33.458 --> 36:34.802
Yes, well, we are
very professional

36:34.826 --> 36:36.760
over here at Poppy's Petals.

36:36.862 --> 36:39.329
Okay. Well, I'm sorry
to interrupt.

36:39.431 --> 36:41.731
I, I just wanted to see
if my friend Tiffany called.

36:41.833 --> 36:43.733
You know Tiffany Daniels?

36:43.835 --> 36:46.369
Yeah. Yeah, her mom's throwing
this big Christmas party,

36:46.471 --> 36:48.305
and we're kinda swamped, so...

36:48.407 --> 36:51.107
I just mentioned your name.

36:51.210 --> 36:53.143
You sent me the referral.

36:53.245 --> 36:55.178
- Is that bad?
- No, it's...

36:55.280 --> 36:58.815
Well, it's just weird that you
are supporting your competitor.

36:58.917 --> 37:01.551
Oh, come on, we don't have
to compete outside the show.

37:01.653 --> 37:03.420
I suppose not, I...

37:03.522 --> 37:05.422
I just don't know what to say.

37:05.524 --> 37:08.091
I'm sorry, did I,
did I screw up?

37:08.193 --> 37:09.492
No, no, not at all.

37:09.595 --> 37:12.996
It's actually very sweet.
Thank you.

37:13.098 --> 37:16.566
Well, look, maybe you'll
agree to have dinner with me

37:16.668 --> 37:17.567
after the show?

37:17.669 --> 37:18.902
Say yes.

37:19.004 --> 37:22.606
What would Blair say?

37:22.708 --> 37:24.941
Well, I'm more interested
to know what you would say.

37:25.043 --> 37:26.643
Just say yes.

37:26.745 --> 37:28.178
Yeah. Just say yes.

37:28.280 --> 37:29.779
It... I don't know.

37:29.881 --> 37:32.115
It just, it just feels
very complicated.

37:33.352 --> 37:35.552
Okay, well, how's this?

37:35.654 --> 37:37.454
If we both make it
to the finals,

37:37.556 --> 37:39.200
we'll go have dinner together
to celebrate.

37:39.224 --> 37:41.558
- I'm so going to the finals.
- Great. So am I.

37:41.660 --> 37:43.026
Done. Okay.

37:43.128 --> 37:44.772
- I'm looking forward to dinner.
- -Yes!

37:44.796 --> 37:46.162
Stop.

37:46.265 --> 37:48.164
- What? I didn't do any...
- You stop it.

38:23.101 --> 38:24.334
Oh, dear.

39:08.580 --> 39:11.948
Good evening,
and welcome, one and all,

39:12.050 --> 39:15.819
to the Santa Mesa
Holiday Floral Show

39:15.921 --> 39:18.588
semi-final competition.

39:18.690 --> 39:21.658
We have had an amazing day
of flowers

39:21.760 --> 39:24.828
and holiday cheer,
ladies and gentlemen.

39:24.930 --> 39:26.262
Don't you agree?

39:29.000 --> 39:30.166
Yes.

39:31.636 --> 39:35.205
I believe the theme
could easily have been

39:35.307 --> 39:38.908
Holiday Floral Fashion
At Its Finest.

39:39.010 --> 39:43.580
Let's give all these designers
a huge round of applause.

39:47.652 --> 39:51.187
And before we announce
our top three finalists,

39:51.289 --> 39:54.090
I am pleased to announce

39:54.192 --> 39:58.261
that theme of this year's
flower grand finale

39:58.363 --> 40:01.564
in one week will be
Alice in a Winter Wonderland.

40:05.137 --> 40:07.337
Prepare to be enchanted.

40:07.439 --> 40:11.007
And now, the moment
you've been waiting for.

40:11.109 --> 40:14.010
Our top three
contending finalists

40:14.112 --> 40:17.447
in no particular order.

40:17.549 --> 40:22.252
Audrey and Phil Wilson
of Roses Are Red Florals.

40:30.061 --> 40:33.696
Our second finalist is...

40:33.799 --> 40:36.566
Garrett Hurley
of Covington Designs.

40:41.773 --> 40:44.174
And our third and last finalist

40:44.276 --> 40:49.145
for this year's
Santa Mesa Holiday Floral Show

40:49.247 --> 40:51.714
is...

40:51.817 --> 40:56.252
Poppy Benson of Poppy's Petals.

41:02.594 --> 41:04.961
So, looks we have a celebratory
dinner tonight.

41:05.997 --> 41:07.564
It appears we do.

41:07.666 --> 41:10.500
Here's my card with my mobile.
Just text me your address.

41:10.602 --> 41:11.734
Maybe 7 o'clock?

41:11.837 --> 41:14.103
Let me just check my schedule.

41:17.309 --> 41:19.309
Yeah. It should be fine.

41:19.411 --> 41:20.510
Yeah? Great.

41:20.612 --> 41:21.978
Okay.

41:24.216 --> 41:27.617
- Hey, Garrett. Come on in.
- Hey, Mr. Benson.

41:29.721 --> 41:31.821
That's a good-looking tree.

41:31.923 --> 41:33.256
Have a seat.

41:38.763 --> 41:41.798
So, as the father of, the girl

41:41.900 --> 41:43.140
you're about to take on a date,

41:43.201 --> 41:45.702
I have to ask.

41:45.804 --> 41:49.739
Is this an attempt to,
shake down the enemy?

41:49.841 --> 41:51.241
For inside information?

41:51.343 --> 41:54.410
No, sir. Not at all.

41:54.513 --> 41:58.114
Good. Because I'd hate for
my daughter to be disappointed.

41:58.216 --> 42:00.336
You know, if your intentions
weren't on the up and up.

42:00.385 --> 42:03.586
I have, I had no plans
of disappointing her

42:03.688 --> 42:05.054
in, in any way, sir.

42:05.156 --> 42:06.890
I assure you.

42:06.992 --> 42:09.692
So, what are your intentions?

42:11.463 --> 42:13.263
Well, as, as it relates
to dinner,

42:13.365 --> 42:16.165
it's purely, a date-related.

42:16.268 --> 42:17.912
I mean, I mean, the dinner's not
a professional date,

42:17.936 --> 42:19.969
it's more of a personal...

42:20.071 --> 42:23.840
nature.

42:25.777 --> 42:28.411
You know, the truth is, I just
think your daughter's great.

42:28.513 --> 42:31.514
And honestly, I just wanna get
to know her better, that's all.

42:31.616 --> 42:33.249
Well, I am glad
we cleared this up.

42:33.351 --> 42:34.551
How about a drink, Garrett?

42:34.653 --> 42:35.653
Eggnog?

42:37.789 --> 42:39.422
I'm good. I appreciate it.

42:39.524 --> 42:41.691
Okay. Well, how about water?

42:41.793 --> 42:43.626
'Cause you're kinda
breaking a little sweat.

42:43.728 --> 42:46.129
Yeah. I'm feeling a little...
Water sounds good.

42:46.231 --> 42:48.164
Okay, then. I'll be right back.

43:15.694 --> 43:18.161
That wedding picture
is my grandparents.

43:18.263 --> 43:19.829
This used to be their house.

43:19.931 --> 43:21.497
I got you a cookie bouquet.

43:23.602 --> 43:26.336
I figured you can't get enough
florist flowers, right?

43:26.438 --> 43:29.172
Well, thank you.
It's, it's very sweet.

43:31.610 --> 43:33.142
You look beautiful.

43:33.244 --> 43:35.378
Thanks.

43:35.480 --> 43:37.046
So, how old are you
in this photo?

43:37.148 --> 43:40.016
I was eight years old.

43:41.152 --> 43:43.052
And that's your mom?

43:43.154 --> 43:46.089
Gosh. You really got her eyes.

43:46.191 --> 43:48.257
Yeah, apparently,
I have her green thumb, too,

43:48.360 --> 43:50.393
which she inherited
from my grandma.

43:50.495 --> 43:52.195
Come see. This...

43:52.297 --> 43:55.465
This was my mom's garden.
It was amazing.

43:55.567 --> 43:57.533
She had all these wild flowers
and climbing vines

43:57.636 --> 43:59.402
and butterflies and roses.

44:00.338 --> 44:01.971
Really magical.

44:02.073 --> 44:05.141
Had a lot of fairy tale princess
adventures in there.

44:05.243 --> 44:07.477
That sounds beautiful.

44:07.579 --> 44:10.079
Yeah. Maybe I'll recreate it
some day.

44:10.181 --> 44:11.547
You should.

44:11.650 --> 44:14.150
It'd be like going on
a whole new adventure.

44:15.954 --> 44:17.987
Yeah, maybe.

44:18.089 --> 44:20.523
I come bearing hydration
and eggnog.

44:20.625 --> 44:22.992
- Hey.
- Uh, thank you, dad.

44:23.094 --> 44:25.194
But we actually
have to get going.

44:25.296 --> 44:27.797
That's right.
I made a reservation at 7:30.

44:27.899 --> 44:29.632
- So...
- Okay, fine.

44:29.734 --> 44:31.834
But don't stay out too late.

44:31.936 --> 44:34.771
You have a big day of making
arrangements tomorrow. Yes?

44:34.873 --> 44:37.006
Okay. Yes, I do. Okay.

44:37.108 --> 44:38.474
All right, I assure you.

44:38.576 --> 44:40.216
I will have her back
at a reasonable hour.

44:41.846 --> 44:43.980
All right. Thank you.

44:44.082 --> 44:46.115
Okay. You kids have a good time.

44:52.691 --> 44:55.258
Okay. I-I'm sorry.
My dad just texted me.

44:55.360 --> 44:57.393
The good news is he likes you.

44:57.495 --> 44:58.861
I am so sorry he grilled you.

44:58.963 --> 45:00.496
I had nothing to do with that.

45:00.598 --> 45:03.366
That's okay. He was fine.
It was fine.

45:03.468 --> 45:05.668
I think he's just concerned
with how invested you are

45:05.770 --> 45:07.103
with Covington, that's all.

45:07.205 --> 45:09.072
Am I?

45:09.174 --> 45:11.107
I don't know.
I guess I get it.

45:11.209 --> 45:13.242
I'm just, I'm torn sometimes

45:13.344 --> 45:16.479
between my obligations
and my passions, that's all.

45:16.581 --> 45:17.947
What do you mean?

45:18.049 --> 45:19.449
I just mean I...

45:19.551 --> 45:21.017
There's a lot...

45:21.119 --> 45:23.586
There's a lot I have left
I want to achieve.

45:23.688 --> 45:26.789
Well, I'm sure you will,
because you're very talented.

45:26.891 --> 45:27.990
Whoa.

45:28.093 --> 45:29.826
Was that a compliment?

45:30.929 --> 45:32.261
Thank you.

45:34.632 --> 45:36.332
I'm so sorry.
I've been really harsh.

45:36.434 --> 45:40.103
I... I just have so much to lose
in this competition.

45:40.205 --> 45:42.105
Don't we all?

45:42.207 --> 45:44.574
You know, maybe
there's... some way

45:44.676 --> 45:47.443
in which we all end up winning
at the end of this, you think?

45:47.545 --> 45:48.945
Well, if you have
any suggestions,

45:49.047 --> 45:50.480
I'm open to hearing them.

45:50.582 --> 45:51.914
Or maybe we can just hope

45:52.016 --> 45:54.917
that everyone's Christmas wishes
come true.

45:55.019 --> 45:57.286
Well, sharing this evening
with you has certainly been

45:57.388 --> 45:59.288
getting things off
to a good start.

46:01.626 --> 46:03.593
No, no, no. I..
Let me, I insist.

46:03.695 --> 46:06.496
Can I, please? You already
got me the Country Club gig.

46:06.598 --> 46:07.764
I can get this. Please...

46:07.866 --> 46:09.866
My pleasure. Tell you what.

46:09.968 --> 46:11.434
Why don't you treat me
to a dessert,

46:11.536 --> 46:12.802
and then we'll call it even?

46:12.904 --> 46:14.237
Dessert?

46:14.339 --> 46:17.240
Okay. Thank you.

46:17.342 --> 46:19.175
This place is so cute.

46:19.277 --> 46:20.476
It's very Christmassy.

46:20.578 --> 46:22.078
<i>It is very Christmassy.</i>

46:22.180 --> 46:24.580
Good coffee, good desserts.

46:24.682 --> 46:28.217
So, I was thinking
of using Indonesian eucalyptus

46:28.319 --> 46:29.519
for Tiffany's mom's party.

46:29.621 --> 46:32.522
I want the center pieces
to be very edgy.

46:32.624 --> 46:34.357
Edgy flowers, huh?

46:34.459 --> 46:36.759
That's very rock and roll
of you.

46:36.861 --> 46:40.196
Are you questioning
my rock and roll?

46:40.298 --> 46:43.599
I would never question
a lady's rock and roll.

46:43.701 --> 46:46.402
It's very unchivalrous of me.

46:48.206 --> 46:51.974
Seriously though,
your passion's really inspiring.

46:52.076 --> 46:55.011
I mean it, it-it's really clear
that you love what you do.

46:55.113 --> 46:56.957
- Can we have two?
- I mean, what's not to love?

46:56.981 --> 47:00.516
I mean, my job is to make
people's lives pretty.

47:00.618 --> 47:02.919
Yeah, that's a really great way
if think about it.

47:03.021 --> 47:04.720
Thank you.

47:04.823 --> 47:07.156
- Thank you.
- Yum.

47:07.258 --> 47:08.958
You know, sometimes,
I feel like I get

47:09.060 --> 47:11.527
just too caught up
in the business side of things.

47:11.629 --> 47:13.896
Don't feel bad.

47:13.998 --> 47:15.476
It's hard to get caught up
in business,

47:15.500 --> 47:17.567
especially when you don't
have a lot of business.

47:20.572 --> 47:21.671
Thank you.

47:28.179 --> 47:29.924
You're really talented
at what you do, Poppy.

47:29.948 --> 47:31.547
You know that?

47:31.649 --> 47:32.993
Your grandmother knew
what she was doing

47:33.017 --> 47:34.116
when she gave you the shop.

47:34.219 --> 47:35.418
Thank you.

47:35.520 --> 47:37.019
What about you?

47:37.121 --> 47:40.890
Do you, plan on staying
at Covington Design?

47:40.992 --> 47:44.660
You know, I owe Blair a lot.

47:44.762 --> 47:46.629
I mean, kinda my whole career.

47:46.731 --> 47:48.464
Does it mean she owns you?

47:48.566 --> 47:50.633
Well, we're in negotiations

47:50.735 --> 47:53.569
about my, my future
at the company.

47:53.671 --> 47:56.205
But I think
after the flower show...

47:56.307 --> 47:58.074
maybe some big change
is in store.

47:58.176 --> 47:59.876
You mean, after
I win the flower show.

47:59.978 --> 48:01.711
Well, if you play it like that

48:01.813 --> 48:05.147
<i>then I am gonna question
your rock and roll.</i>

48:05.250 --> 48:08.818
Lady or no lady,
the gloves are comin' off.

48:13.057 --> 48:15.258
Okay.

48:15.360 --> 48:17.426
Hey, can we have two espressos,
please?

48:17.528 --> 48:20.496
So, what got you
into floral design?

48:22.066 --> 48:25.301
Well, after I graduated
from college,

48:25.403 --> 48:30.172
I got a master's degree in both
Architecture and Business.

48:30.275 --> 48:32.475
And then I became
Blair's assistant.

48:32.577 --> 48:35.144
- Her assistant?
- Yeah.

48:35.246 --> 48:37.647
Yeah. All-all the places
I applied to for jobs

48:37.749 --> 48:39.582
thought I was over-qualified.

48:39.684 --> 48:42.451
And I didn't have job.
I needed one.

48:42.553 --> 48:44.887
And so, she took a chance on me
when no one else would.

48:44.989 --> 48:47.256
Wasn't expecting to hear that.

48:47.358 --> 48:50.393
Yeah. She, she and my mom
are old friends.

48:50.495 --> 48:52.806
And so, you know, I thought
she'd be a good place to start,

48:52.830 --> 48:55.197
and then I'd move along
to something bigger and better,

48:55.300 --> 48:57.566
but she was working a...

48:57.669 --> 49:00.536
a wedding for a friend, solo

49:00.638 --> 49:02.371
and she got in
way over her head.

49:02.473 --> 49:04.507
Blair Covington in over head?

49:04.609 --> 49:06.475
I find that hard to believe.

49:06.577 --> 49:09.412
Well, believe it.

49:09.514 --> 49:14.717
Yeah, she first had me doing
the boy's boutonnieres.

49:14.819 --> 49:16.886
And I guess she was impressed
with what I did there,

49:16.988 --> 49:18.421
and so, then she, you know,

49:18.523 --> 49:19.803
had me do
the flower arrangements

49:19.857 --> 49:21.357
in the foyer.

49:21.459 --> 49:26.362
And, yeah, after a while,
we both kinda realized

49:26.464 --> 49:27.775
not only was it something
I was good at,

49:27.799 --> 49:31.968
but, you know, something
I kinda love doing.

49:32.070 --> 49:34.036
That's amazing.

49:34.138 --> 49:36.939
Yeah, well, you know,
arranging flowers

49:37.041 --> 49:38.908
is all architecture.

49:39.010 --> 49:42.311
I've always kinda had an eye
for symmetry and...

49:42.413 --> 49:44.246
and design and...

49:44.349 --> 49:45.581
I don't know, you know,

49:45.683 --> 49:46.849
maybe I could use a little

49:46.951 --> 49:48.851
of what I learned
in grad school.

49:50.121 --> 49:51.487
Anyways,
the rest is just history.

49:51.589 --> 49:53.756
I've been with her ever since.

49:53.858 --> 49:57.426
I just assumed Covington Designs
had been around forever.

49:57.528 --> 50:00.563
Well, there was once in time
when Blair Covington

50:00.665 --> 50:02.631
was the new florist in town.

50:02.734 --> 50:04.834
Just like you.

50:04.936 --> 50:07.670
She worked hard for her success.

50:07.772 --> 50:09.105
We both did.

50:09.207 --> 50:11.407
So, what, you just pulled up
your bootstraps

50:11.509 --> 50:12.820
made a couple boutonnieres
and now

50:12.844 --> 50:15.177
you're the best-dressed florist
in town?

50:15.279 --> 50:16.979
Easy as that?

50:17.081 --> 50:19.749
Yeah. Just sitting
at a candlelit table,

50:19.851 --> 50:22.051
drinking an espresso

50:22.153 --> 50:26.022
with the most beautiful florist
in town.

50:26.124 --> 50:29.325
It's as simple as that.

50:29.427 --> 50:30.693
Cheers.

50:37.301 --> 50:39.702
Okay, this is it.

50:39.804 --> 50:42.438
You are officially
behind enemy lines.

50:42.540 --> 50:43.873
What do you think?

50:43.975 --> 50:45.941
It's really cute.

50:46.044 --> 50:48.611
It's exactly what I thought
your shop would look like.

50:48.713 --> 50:49.612
I'm just gonna
get these sketches.

50:49.714 --> 50:51.514
I can't believe I left them.

50:55.720 --> 50:56.819
Okay.!

50:59.991 --> 51:01.891
Could I maybe interest you

51:01.993 --> 51:04.593
in one of our lovely
Christmas arrangements?

51:04.695 --> 51:07.797
Maybe something sophisticated
and, and charming?

51:09.300 --> 51:11.133
Only if I can help.

51:11.235 --> 51:13.602
I'm pretty particular
about my arrangements.

51:16.941 --> 51:18.541
Okay.

51:18.643 --> 51:21.744
Well, why don't we see
what happens

51:21.846 --> 51:27.583
when the new girl
and the old guard join forces?

51:28.986 --> 51:29.986
Okay.

52:35.620 --> 52:37.820
Hah! Keeping my hours, are you?

52:37.922 --> 52:40.456
Is this part of your bid
for partnership?

52:40.558 --> 52:43.092
No, I just woke up happy,
that's all.

52:43.194 --> 52:45.494
For the final?

52:45.596 --> 52:47.129
Nah. About a lot of things.

52:48.399 --> 52:49.932
I, I like this.

52:50.034 --> 52:52.801
This is fresh and sophisticated.

52:52.904 --> 52:55.237
Can we get a photo,
for our portfolio?

52:55.339 --> 52:58.941
No, I can't, because I didn't
actually design it myself.

52:59.043 --> 53:00.242
Well, then, who did?

53:00.344 --> 53:03.345
Poppy Benson and I
made it together.

53:03.447 --> 53:04.447
Poppy?

53:05.683 --> 53:07.750
How did that come about?

53:07.852 --> 53:09.752
I think it's called a...

53:09.854 --> 53:12.988
a date, Blair.

53:13.090 --> 53:15.191
- A date?
- Yeah, it's this great thing.

53:15.293 --> 53:16.892
People find each other
attractive,

53:16.994 --> 53:19.528
they go out, they grab a meal,
they get to know each other.

53:19.630 --> 53:21.330
And arrange flowers together?

53:21.432 --> 53:23.332
Pretty much. Ta-dah.

53:23.434 --> 53:25.134
Listen, I gotta put this
on my desk.

53:25.236 --> 53:26.813
I'll swing by your office and
we'll talk about that banquet

53:26.837 --> 53:28.437
in New York.

53:28.539 --> 53:30.005
- Morning, Marie.
- Good morning.

53:38.616 --> 53:40.816
- What do you think?
- Ooh.

53:40.918 --> 53:42.685
You meets cool.

53:42.787 --> 53:43.986
I like that.

53:44.088 --> 53:45.088
Great, I'll hashtag it

53:45.156 --> 53:46.055
and put it on the Petals page.

53:46.157 --> 53:47.056
Okay, so if we could just

53:47.158 --> 53:48.824
multiply this by thirty,

53:48.926 --> 53:52.127
and then, add in twelve or so
large arrangements,

53:52.230 --> 53:53.295
we've got a party.

53:53.397 --> 53:55.264
And it's about T-minus 26 hours

53:55.366 --> 53:57.800
until the first center piece
hits the table.

53:57.902 --> 53:59.368
Are you ready
for an all-nighter?

53:59.470 --> 54:01.036
If you're willing
to meet my terms.

54:01.138 --> 54:02.371
- Hit me.
- Okay.

54:02.473 --> 54:04.440
One of your father's
famous fruit cakes

54:04.542 --> 54:06.408
with extra-green cherries,

54:06.510 --> 54:08.811
and I'm gonna need
a lot of caffeine.

54:08.913 --> 54:11.080
Okay, well, we have plenty
of espresso in the back.

54:11.182 --> 54:14.717
And I will put the request in
with my dad right now.

54:14.819 --> 54:16.218
- Thank you.
- Okay.

54:17.455 --> 54:18.954
So...

54:19.056 --> 54:22.057
no more playing coy, Ms. Benson.

54:22.159 --> 54:25.027
I wanna know all about
Mr. Covington Designs.

54:25.129 --> 54:27.963
He's, he's, actually
a really nice guy.

54:28.065 --> 54:29.765
Boring.
Skip to the good stuff.

54:29.867 --> 54:35.271
Okay. He, he smells
like cedar and vanilla.

54:35.373 --> 54:37.773
Okay. We're getting warmer.

54:37.875 --> 54:39.019
And when he puts his arms
around me,

54:39.043 --> 54:39.942
I feel like a marshmallow

54:40.044 --> 54:41.543
melting in hot cocoa.

54:41.646 --> 54:43.812
We have a winner.

54:45.182 --> 54:46.882
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

54:46.984 --> 54:49.218
This is when you get
your happy back.

54:49.320 --> 54:51.854
- What?
- All the happy you give away?

54:51.956 --> 54:53.422
It's finally coming back to you.

54:54.959 --> 54:56.659
Okay. We have work to do,
let's go.

54:56.761 --> 54:58.594
Okay, we're on it.

54:58.696 --> 55:00.562
One hundred and forty-five
eucalyptus fronds

55:00.665 --> 55:01.563
cut and trimmed.

55:01.666 --> 55:02.564
Check.

55:02.667 --> 55:06.001
Now, only 145 more to go.

55:12.610 --> 55:14.977
I was just gonna leave
for the night.

55:15.079 --> 55:17.813
Don't you think
it's a little dim in here?

55:17.915 --> 55:21.083
You can't do your best work
if you have to squint to see.

55:21.185 --> 55:23.952
Nah, the atmosphere
helps me focus.

55:24.055 --> 55:26.722
Your focus is something I've
wanted to speak with you about.

55:28.025 --> 55:29.725
Is there a problem?

55:29.827 --> 55:33.028
Well, I know that you've,
become fond of that Poppy girl.

55:33.130 --> 55:35.597
- Yes.
- So, I'll just be blunt.

55:35.700 --> 55:37.700
When are you ever anything but?

55:37.802 --> 55:39.968
She's a direct competitor.

55:40.071 --> 55:42.538
So I think you might consider
what her motivation is

55:42.640 --> 55:44.907
for becoming friendly with you.

55:45.009 --> 55:46.475
What are you trying to say?

55:46.577 --> 55:48.977
I don't want you to
lose your edge...

55:49.080 --> 55:51.480
just because you've become
smitten with some girl

55:51.582 --> 55:55.284
who could just be trying
to distract you from winning.

55:55.386 --> 55:58.954
Look, Blair, I know you like
to be in control of everything...

55:59.056 --> 56:01.724
You have a lot riding on this,
Garrett.

56:01.826 --> 56:03.258
We both do.

56:03.361 --> 56:05.227
You know, my personal life
is not a subsidiary

56:05.329 --> 56:06.762
of Covington Designs.

56:06.864 --> 56:09.365
I just have your best interest
at heart.

56:11.302 --> 56:12.868
Well, I'm not so sure.

56:19.110 --> 56:21.143
Well, it's late,
and you, you're tired,

56:21.245 --> 56:23.345
so...

56:23.447 --> 56:24.447
call it a night soon

56:24.482 --> 56:25.614
and tomorrow, everything

56:25.716 --> 56:27.950
will be fresh and new.

56:28.919 --> 56:30.719
How so?

56:30.821 --> 56:32.187
Goodnight.

56:38.596 --> 56:40.429
Okay.

56:40.531 --> 56:41.663
Just move that box.

56:41.766 --> 56:43.732
- Okay.
- Thank you.

56:43.834 --> 56:46.769
Over there. Okay, great.

56:46.871 --> 56:49.471
Excuse me, are you the famous
Poppy from Poppy's Petals?

56:49.573 --> 56:52.808
Maybe. Who's asking?

56:52.910 --> 56:55.411
Breakfast croissant
delivery service.

56:55.513 --> 56:57.212
I mean, you can't
properly arrange

56:57.314 --> 56:58.480
flowers on an empty stomach.

56:58.582 --> 56:59.815
It's peanut butter and jelly.

56:59.917 --> 57:01.049
It's my favorite.

57:01.152 --> 57:02.651
How did you know?

57:02.753 --> 57:05.387
- Lucky guess.
- This look delicious.

57:05.489 --> 57:06.833
- Thank you.
- Hi, I'm Natalie. Remember?

57:06.857 --> 57:08.390
We met. Okay, we gotta go.

57:08.492 --> 57:10.070
I know this looks delicious.
Put it down.

57:10.094 --> 57:11.805
We gotta go. We've got flowers
wilting in there.

57:11.829 --> 57:13.429
- Okay. Okay.
- All right.

57:15.099 --> 57:17.065
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

57:17.168 --> 57:19.234
See you later, right?

57:19.336 --> 57:20.402
Yeah. I'll see you there.

57:20.504 --> 57:21.637
Okay.

57:23.574 --> 57:25.541
- Bye, Natalie.
- Bye!

57:25.643 --> 57:28.177
You left the backdoor... Yeah.
. Could you? Thank you.

57:36.153 --> 57:37.631
You don't have to wait,
we'll be fine.

57:37.655 --> 57:38.854
I'm gonna call Joe.

57:38.956 --> 57:41.323
Just pop the hood.
I'll, I'll check it.

57:41.425 --> 57:44.293
Does he know about...

57:48.098 --> 57:50.399
Do you know anything about cars?

57:50.501 --> 57:52.367
Well, I know
Edna's irreplaceable.

57:52.470 --> 57:54.336
You remember her name.

57:54.438 --> 57:56.878
I don't know what all I can do,
but at least I'll take a look.

57:56.941 --> 57:59.241
Okay. Nat, could you call Joe?

57:59.343 --> 58:00.909
Yeah, I'm on it.

58:01.011 --> 58:03.011
I can't believe
this is happening.

58:05.182 --> 58:08.750
I don't know
what the problem is.

58:08.853 --> 58:11.520
Well, with Edna, the question
is, "What isn't the problem?"

58:11.622 --> 58:13.533
If we don't leave for Tiffany's
party now, we're gonna miss it.

58:13.557 --> 58:15.635
Well, Joe said he can't be here
for an hour and a half.

58:15.659 --> 58:17.659
I think I have a solution
pulling up right now.

58:17.761 --> 58:19.194
Garrett, what is this?

58:19.296 --> 58:21.763
Okay. Today, we're giving
Cranky Edna a rest.

58:21.866 --> 58:23.532
Come help me unload these,
arrangements.

58:26.504 --> 58:28.070
You don't wanna miss the party,
do you?

58:28.172 --> 58:29.371
- No.
- Nice.

58:30.541 --> 58:32.441
- Okay, come on.
- Okay, okay.

58:34.612 --> 58:35.978
Thanks, buddy.

58:45.789 --> 58:47.689
I think that's it. We did it.

58:47.791 --> 58:50.092
And we finished a little early

58:50.194 --> 58:53.495
which leaves me time to freshen
up for my holiday date tonight.

58:53.597 --> 58:54.763
- Ooh!
- I mean, that is...

58:54.865 --> 58:56.164
If you don't need me anymore.

58:56.267 --> 58:58.367
Nope. All the heavy-lifting
is done.

58:58.469 --> 59:00.247
I'm gonna stick around and wait
for the party to begin.

59:00.271 --> 59:02.237
I want Tiffany to tell me
how much she loves it.

59:02.339 --> 59:04.072
She's gonna love it.

59:04.174 --> 59:05.407
And these smell amazing.

59:05.509 --> 59:07.743
This eucalyptus
was the perfect touch.

59:07.845 --> 59:10.779
Yeah. Okay, scoot.
But don't stay out too late.

59:10.881 --> 59:12.526
I need you fresh for
the competition in the morning.

59:12.550 --> 59:15.350
I was born fresh.

59:42.279 --> 59:43.612
Thank you.

59:58.829 --> 01:00:01.129
- The flowers are lovely, dear.
- Thank you.

01:00:01.231 --> 01:00:04.199
Yeah, I'm really happy
how everything turned out.

01:00:04.301 --> 01:00:06.435
And you look nice, as well.

01:00:06.537 --> 01:00:08.870
Well, thank you.
I mean, you look amazing.

01:00:08.973 --> 01:00:10.383
I could never wear
anything like that.

01:00:10.407 --> 01:00:12.207
I would undoubtedly
spill something on it.

01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:15.210
I suppose it does take
a little grace

01:00:15.312 --> 01:00:17.412
or something to pull it off.

01:00:17.514 --> 01:00:19.815
Aren't they
a picture of perfection?

01:00:19.917 --> 01:00:23.185
Garrett and Tiffany.

01:00:23.287 --> 01:00:25.621
- What do you mean?
- Well...

01:00:25.723 --> 01:00:27.923
I mean, supposedly,
they're just friends right now.

01:00:28.025 --> 01:00:31.593
But everyone knows that there's
unrequited flame between them

01:00:31.695 --> 01:00:34.196
that could go off
at any moment and...

01:00:34.298 --> 01:00:36.431
I mean, why shouldn't it?

01:00:36.533 --> 01:00:39.801
They've been so close
for so many years.

01:00:39.903 --> 01:00:43.205
Not to mention,
they look perfect together.

01:00:43.307 --> 01:00:44.906
Poppy, dear, are you okay?

01:00:47.411 --> 01:00:50.045
Yeah, I'm fine, I...

01:00:50.147 --> 01:00:52.614
just wanna make sure everything
looks perfect for the party.

01:00:52.716 --> 01:00:54.883
It'll be wonderful.

01:00:56.820 --> 01:01:01.223
Everything happens
as it should and...

01:01:01.325 --> 01:01:05.060
and someday soon, those two
will realize it, as well.

01:01:06.997 --> 01:01:10.766
You know, I know that we did not
start off on the right foot.

01:01:10.868 --> 01:01:13.835
But I assure you,
as I've been there,

01:01:13.937 --> 01:01:16.872
it's not wise for a woman
to give her heart to a man

01:01:16.974 --> 01:01:19.574
who's really pining
for someone else.

01:01:20.577 --> 01:01:21.610
Right.

01:01:36.827 --> 01:01:38.994
Could someone get her a tissue?

01:01:39.096 --> 01:01:43.031
- My...
- Tiffany, Tiffany, look.

01:01:43.133 --> 01:01:44.933
Oh, Poppy. Eucalyptus?

01:01:45.035 --> 01:01:46.968
My grandmother
is horribly allergic.

01:01:47.071 --> 01:01:50.272
- Excuse me.
- -I didn't tell you.

01:01:50.374 --> 01:01:52.074
What do I do?

01:01:52.176 --> 01:01:53.909
We're on it. We're on it.

01:01:57.081 --> 01:02:00.215
Okay. I think that's all of it.
What else can I do?

01:02:00.317 --> 01:02:01.677
No, you just go back
to your party.

01:02:01.719 --> 01:02:04.319
- I think you've done enough.
- What's wrong?

01:02:04.421 --> 01:02:06.288
I told you
I was using eucalyptus.

01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:08.150
Are you gonna try and tell me
you didn't know

01:02:08.192 --> 01:02:09.869
that your girlfriend's
grandmother would literally

01:02:09.893 --> 01:02:11.893
keel over at the sight
of a eucalyptus branch?

01:02:11.995 --> 01:02:13.695
My girlfriend?

01:02:13.797 --> 01:02:15.630
It's not a secret.

01:02:15.733 --> 01:02:17.866
Blair told me your past
and your future.

01:02:17.968 --> 01:02:20.168
Wait, Blair told you
what exactly?

01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:21.903
Don't worry about it, Garrett.

01:02:22.005 --> 01:02:24.506
I knew I shouldn't
have trusted you.

01:02:24.608 --> 01:02:26.241
It was quite clear
this entire time

01:02:26.343 --> 01:02:29.344
you have been stringing me
all along just like your boss.

01:02:29.446 --> 01:02:31.379
Okay, Poppy,
you've got it all wrong.

01:02:31.482 --> 01:02:33.482
Apparently, I do.

01:02:35.586 --> 01:02:36.952
Poppy...

01:02:40.090 --> 01:02:41.490
Are you feeling better, grandma?

01:02:41.592 --> 01:02:43.325
I am, sweetheart. Thank you.

01:02:43.427 --> 01:02:44.626
Well, bless Tiffany's heart.

01:02:44.728 --> 01:02:46.072
But this is what happens
when you use

01:02:46.096 --> 01:02:47.929
an inexperienced vendor.

01:02:55.205 --> 01:02:56.772
Hey, Blair.

01:02:56.874 --> 01:02:59.207
Can I...

01:02:59.309 --> 01:03:01.810
Why did you tell Poppy that
Tiffany's my girlfriend?

01:03:01.912 --> 01:03:04.179
Girlfriend? I never said
anything of the sort.

01:03:04.281 --> 01:03:06.548
Is, is winning that important
that you're willing

01:03:06.650 --> 01:03:08.817
to hurt me to do it?

01:03:08.919 --> 01:03:12.854
I want you to succeed, Garrett.
None of this is for me.

01:03:12.956 --> 01:03:15.157
I think you're scared
because she's good.

01:03:15.259 --> 01:03:16.825
You're better.

01:03:16.927 --> 01:03:18.994
Well, that remains to be seen,
but you know what,

01:03:19.096 --> 01:03:20.695
I'm willing to let
the judges decide.

01:03:20.798 --> 01:03:21.963
This is silly.

01:03:22.065 --> 01:03:23.098
You know, we can discuss

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:25.534
this tomorrow, Garrett,
privately.

01:03:25.636 --> 01:03:27.769
We had a deal, Blair.

01:03:27.871 --> 01:03:29.638
If I lose, I sign on
for five more years.

01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:31.473
But I know I can win this thing

01:03:31.575 --> 01:03:34.543
without your... tactics.

01:03:34.645 --> 01:03:37.546
So, please,
let me do this on my own.

01:03:37.648 --> 01:03:40.015
Fine. I'm a spectator.

01:03:40.117 --> 01:03:42.317
I yield to your endeavors. Okay?

01:03:42.419 --> 01:03:44.786
Look, it's Governor Stratton.

01:03:44.888 --> 01:03:46.822
I will go say hello.

01:04:51.088 --> 01:04:52.921
Joe.

01:04:56.393 --> 01:04:57.826
So did I.

01:05:06.036 --> 01:05:08.203
Poppy?

01:05:08.305 --> 01:05:10.972
Poppy, it's dad. Are you okay?

01:05:11.074 --> 01:05:13.041
I made you peanut butter
and jelly toast.

01:05:13.143 --> 01:05:15.110
Let me try.

01:05:15.212 --> 01:05:16.344
Hey, Poppy.

01:05:16.446 --> 01:05:17.746
It's Natalie.

01:05:17.848 --> 01:05:19.292
Come on, you gotta get up.
It's show time.

01:05:19.316 --> 01:05:20.715
We need to get to the finals.

01:05:20.817 --> 01:05:23.051
I'm not going anywhere.

01:05:23.153 --> 01:05:25.754
Edna's not moving
and I'm not moving.

01:05:25.856 --> 01:05:26.755
It's over.

01:05:26.857 --> 01:05:29.557
Poppy Hyacinth Benson,

01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:30.900
what would your grandmother say

01:05:30.961 --> 01:05:32.594
if she saw you
giving up like this?

01:05:32.696 --> 01:05:34.329
What would your mother say?

01:05:34.431 --> 01:05:38.300
I gave someone an allergic
reaction with my flowers.

01:05:38.402 --> 01:05:40.135
Eucalyptus, of all things.

01:05:40.237 --> 01:05:42.170
Who's allergic to eucalyptus?

01:05:42.272 --> 01:05:44.639
Poppy, please let us in.

01:05:44.741 --> 01:05:47.909
No. I can do everything
from here.

01:05:48.011 --> 01:05:50.946
I got a cell phone,
I got a hot-spot...

01:05:51.048 --> 01:05:52.392
Yeah, well you're gonna be
in the hot-seat

01:05:52.416 --> 01:05:53.793
if you don't get it together
and get ready.

01:05:53.817 --> 01:05:54.883
Come on!

01:05:54.985 --> 01:05:56.084
Hold on.

01:06:05.329 --> 01:06:08.096
One, two, three.

01:06:08.198 --> 01:06:10.065
No!

01:06:10.167 --> 01:06:11.566
I don't have to go anywhere.

01:06:11.668 --> 01:06:13.835
I have rights.

01:06:13.937 --> 01:06:16.338
Poppy...
you-you're down but not out.

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:19.741
So, get up, get dressed,
young lady,

01:06:19.843 --> 01:06:22.277
and let's go win this final.

01:06:23.647 --> 01:06:25.547
No, dad, the structure
to my displays

01:06:25.649 --> 01:06:27.215
don't fit in any cars,
and Edna...

01:06:27.317 --> 01:06:28.494
Dad, please don't open
the window.

01:06:28.518 --> 01:06:29.417
I don't need any vitamin-D.

01:06:29.519 --> 01:06:30.919
Would you quit feeling sorry

01:06:31.021 --> 01:06:32.587
for yourself for one second

01:06:32.689 --> 01:06:33.922
and look out the window?

01:06:34.024 --> 01:06:35.724
We got a surprise for you.

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:38.460
Merry Christmas, sleepyhead.

01:06:38.562 --> 01:06:39.861
Why is Joe here?

01:06:39.963 --> 01:06:41.262
Natalie called him this morning.

01:06:41.365 --> 01:06:42.530
Why?

01:06:42.632 --> 01:06:43.732
Just get out here already.

01:06:43.834 --> 01:06:44.899
I'll show you.

01:06:45.002 --> 01:06:46.434
- Come on.
- Come on.

01:06:55.112 --> 01:06:56.711
Let's do it for Edna.

01:06:59.816 --> 01:07:01.583
For Edna.

01:07:01.685 --> 01:07:04.185
Yes!

01:07:08.692 --> 01:07:10.525
Looks like Poppy's Petals
is a no-show.

01:07:10.627 --> 01:07:12.193
- That's too bad.
- Oh, please.

01:07:12.295 --> 01:07:14.562
You nearly buckled
under the pressure, too.

01:07:14.664 --> 01:07:15.964
I did not.

01:07:16.066 --> 01:07:19.167
Well, looks like
your girl's a no-show.

01:07:19.269 --> 01:07:21.469
I'm so sorry, Garrett.

01:07:21.571 --> 01:07:25.273
But at least now you're
practically a shoo-in to win.

01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:28.009
We all know that
Roses Are Red Florals

01:07:28.111 --> 01:07:30.645
has nothing
on Covington Designs.

01:07:30.747 --> 01:07:32.347
That's true.

01:07:32.449 --> 01:07:35.350
Can't you at least be
a little bit excited?

01:07:38.989 --> 01:07:40.588
Cheery good morning

01:07:40.690 --> 01:07:43.391
to all our designers and teams.

01:07:45.128 --> 01:07:47.362
Designers, teams,
would you please come down

01:07:47.464 --> 01:07:48.930
to the podium?

01:07:49.032 --> 01:07:51.299
Thank you, thank you.

01:07:54.237 --> 01:07:55.937
Thank you, thank you.

01:07:56.039 --> 01:08:00.475
Of course, we have a short bit
of business before we start.

01:08:00.577 --> 01:08:04.012
I'd like to start by thanking
all of our sponsors today

01:08:04.114 --> 01:08:06.381
who are making this possible.

01:08:06.483 --> 01:08:08.049
Thank you.

01:08:11.221 --> 01:08:13.421
Garrett, where are you going?

01:08:21.363 --> 01:08:23.163
What took you so long?

01:08:25.335 --> 01:08:26.779
If you're not in the booth
at the time

01:08:26.803 --> 01:08:28.413
that clock starts,
you forfeit the competition.

01:08:28.438 --> 01:08:30.416
I am perfectly fine carrying
this by myself, Garrett.

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:31.783
Let me help you carry this,
Poppy, please.

01:08:31.808 --> 01:08:33.140
Come on.

01:08:33.243 --> 01:08:35.076
For once, will you let
somebody help you?

01:08:35.178 --> 01:08:37.645
Look, Tiffany's not
my girlfriend.

01:08:37.747 --> 01:08:39.091
She's never been my girlfriend,
okay?

01:08:39.116 --> 01:08:40.715
We've just been friends forever.

01:08:40.817 --> 01:08:42.216
How am I supposed
to believe you?

01:08:42.319 --> 01:08:44.078
- Let me help you with that.
- No, it's fine.

01:08:48.358 --> 01:08:49.791
I mean, would
I really be down here

01:08:49.893 --> 01:08:51.259
dying under this giant tea cup

01:08:51.361 --> 01:08:53.495
if I wanted it any other way?

01:08:53.596 --> 01:08:55.563
I suppose not.

01:08:55.665 --> 01:08:58.533
Thank you for helping me again.

01:08:58.635 --> 01:08:59.868
You're welcome.

01:09:03.406 --> 01:09:06.407
But why? I thought you wanted
to win this competition.

01:09:06.510 --> 01:09:09.377
I did. I do. I just...

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:11.746
If I'm gonna win, I wanna do it
fair and square.

01:09:12.816 --> 01:09:14.249
And if I lose...

01:09:15.318 --> 01:09:16.783
I want it to be to you.

01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:21.156
You know, I would kiss you
if I could move.

01:09:21.258 --> 01:09:22.590
Well, here, let me help.

01:09:25.028 --> 01:09:27.028
- Everything okay down there?
- Yeah.

01:09:27.130 --> 01:09:29.363
Two turtle love doves.

01:09:29.466 --> 01:09:31.399
Don't we have a final to get to?

01:09:39.542 --> 01:09:41.943
- You ready?
- Let's do this.

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:48.116
Oh, dear, it looks as if
we're missing Miss Benson

01:09:48.218 --> 01:09:50.852
and Mr. Hurley.

01:09:50.953 --> 01:09:55.089
It appears that
the winners will be...

01:09:55.192 --> 01:09:56.502
- We're here.
- Wait, wait, wait, we're here!

01:09:56.526 --> 01:09:57.759
Cutting it close!

01:09:57.861 --> 01:10:00.895
- We're here.
- We're here.

01:10:02.666 --> 01:10:07.368
I can see this is going to be
a very exciting day!

01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:11.706
Okay, finalists, are you ready?

01:10:13.710 --> 01:10:18.146
Then let the finals begin!

01:10:28.091 --> 01:10:30.225
Okay, guys. Sorry, I'm late.
I need few things.

01:10:30.327 --> 01:10:32.060
Fake snow... Real snow.

01:10:32.162 --> 01:10:33.528
- Okay.
- Let's go.

01:10:35.198 --> 01:10:38.066
Now, let's break this open.

01:10:38.168 --> 01:10:41.603
Garrett, I thought you wanted
to win this thing?

01:10:41.705 --> 01:10:44.539
Or maybe you want to spend
another five years with me?

01:10:44.641 --> 01:10:48.243
You know, there are worse things
than losing, Blair.

01:10:48.345 --> 01:10:51.412
It's Christmas time. Remember?

01:10:51.514 --> 01:10:53.092
And what's important
this time of year is that

01:10:53.116 --> 01:10:55.250
everybody gets a chance

01:10:55.352 --> 01:10:57.885
to-to work hard
at something greater,

01:10:57.988 --> 01:11:02.824
to find hope in-in things
that are out of their control,

01:11:02.926 --> 01:11:06.995
to, to realize that, you know,
lending a helping hand

01:11:07.097 --> 01:11:09.497
is far greater
than any cash prize.

01:11:11.201 --> 01:11:14.602
I remember, I remember when
you thought you were nobody

01:11:14.704 --> 01:11:16.137
and you asked
for my help that day.

01:11:16.239 --> 01:11:18.840
I just miss the girl who...

01:11:18.942 --> 01:11:22.477
trusted in people enough
to ask for a helping hand.

01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:26.881
Anyway, I got to
get back to work

01:11:26.983 --> 01:11:30.151
because Blair Covington
has to win, right?

01:11:37.794 --> 01:11:39.160
Designers!

01:11:39.262 --> 01:11:41.996
You have two hours!

01:11:47.937 --> 01:11:52.373
Okay, Pops, it's time to make
your Christmas wish come true.

01:11:52.475 --> 01:11:53.475
Yes.

01:11:55.845 --> 01:11:57.145
Okay. So, whole right here.

01:11:57.247 --> 01:11:59.380
And the eyes here
and then the...

01:12:16.966 --> 01:12:21.002
Designers, you have
one hour left!

01:12:46.830 --> 01:12:49.931
Designers, you have
one minute left.

01:12:51.701 --> 01:12:53.701
- Blair! What are you doing?
- -Oh, no. The clock.

01:12:53.803 --> 01:12:55.514
- I'm just trying to help.
- Oh, gosh, uh...

01:12:55.538 --> 01:12:56.437
Find me some, floral wire.

01:12:56.539 --> 01:12:57.683
Everything's already packed up.

01:12:57.707 --> 01:12:58.873
Just some string or anything.

01:12:58.975 --> 01:13:00.174
Okay, I'll be right back.

01:13:00.276 --> 01:13:03.344
Yikes. Okay.

01:13:21.898 --> 01:13:25.600
Ten, nine, eight,

01:13:25.702 --> 01:13:28.236
seven, six,

01:13:28.338 --> 01:13:30.438
five, four,

01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:34.642
three, two, one!

01:13:34.744 --> 01:13:36.110
Designers,

01:13:36.212 --> 01:13:39.514
step away from your designs.

01:13:39.616 --> 01:13:42.784
Let the judging begin.

01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:21.756
Thank you.

01:15:20.183 --> 01:15:22.250
Did you see the smiles
on their faces?

01:15:22.352 --> 01:15:23.352
You did it, Pop.

01:15:23.419 --> 01:15:24.819
<i>No, we did it.</i>

01:15:24.921 --> 01:15:27.288
Thank you guys so much.

01:15:27.390 --> 01:15:28.990
It just looks so lifelike.

01:15:29.092 --> 01:15:31.158
Makes me wanna
dip a cookie in it.

01:15:31.261 --> 01:15:32.994
What?

01:15:33.096 --> 01:15:34.473
They had Christmas cookies
on the refreshment table,

01:15:34.497 --> 01:15:35.497
so I grabbed a few.

01:15:35.598 --> 01:15:37.365
Cute. Thanks.

01:15:38.635 --> 01:15:39.778
They should give you
extra points

01:15:39.802 --> 01:15:42.103
for helping the competition out.

01:15:42.205 --> 01:15:45.806
No, I had to. He's been helping
me on numerous amounts of times.

01:15:45.909 --> 01:15:47.875
I felt like I needed to.

01:15:47.977 --> 01:15:49.288
Well, your grandmother
and your mother

01:15:49.312 --> 01:15:51.746
would be very,
very proud of you.

01:15:51.848 --> 01:15:53.259
Thank you.
I just want you guys to know

01:15:53.283 --> 01:15:54.982
I really appreciate it,
and that...

01:15:55.084 --> 01:15:56.918
I mean that from
the bottom of my heart.

01:15:57.020 --> 01:15:58.085
Hey, are you kidding?

01:15:58.187 --> 01:15:59.754
I just came here
for the cookies.

01:16:01.858 --> 01:16:03.858
Seriously,
you guys are the best.

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:06.093
And no matter what happens,
I just want you to know

01:16:06.195 --> 01:16:07.706
that I wouldn't do this
any differently.

01:16:07.730 --> 01:16:09.864
I just want to be with you guys.

01:16:09.966 --> 01:16:12.400
- And especially me.
- Yes.

01:16:12.502 --> 01:16:14.669
Okay. Team Poppy,
let's bring it in.

01:16:18.141 --> 01:16:22.276
We will meet back here
in exactly one hour

01:16:22.378 --> 01:16:24.045
to announce the winners.

01:16:24.147 --> 01:16:27.381
And in the meantime, please,
enjoy the refreshments.

01:16:27.483 --> 01:16:29.617
That's what they're for.

01:16:44.767 --> 01:16:48.436
Will all the finalists
please move down to the stage?

01:16:48.538 --> 01:16:50.171
Thank you.

01:16:50.273 --> 01:16:52.039
Thank you very much.

01:16:52.141 --> 01:16:56.010
It's been a day
of ups and downs,

01:16:56.112 --> 01:16:58.312
fierce competition,

01:16:58.414 --> 01:17:02.249
and, of course,
the magic of the season.

01:17:02.352 --> 01:17:05.386
I, for one,
could not be more proud

01:17:05.488 --> 01:17:09.590
to be a member of
the Santa Mesa Floral Community.

01:17:09.692 --> 01:17:11.592
And how about all of you?

01:17:16.766 --> 01:17:20.067
But enough of
my emotional gushes.

01:17:20.169 --> 01:17:23.604
Let's announce our runners up,
shall we?

01:17:25.808 --> 01:17:29.210
All right, in third place,

01:17:29.312 --> 01:17:34.649
Audrey and Phil Wilson
of Roses Are Red Florals.

01:17:34.751 --> 01:17:36.117
Congratulations.

01:17:40.189 --> 01:17:42.657
And if the two remaining
finalists,

01:17:42.759 --> 01:17:44.925
will please come forward.

01:17:47.930 --> 01:17:51.465
Which one of these two
incredible designers

01:17:51.567 --> 01:17:54.702
will win this year's
competition?

01:17:54.804 --> 01:17:57.571
I really do wish you the best.

01:17:57.674 --> 01:17:58.806
You, too.

01:18:03.246 --> 01:18:05.246
And the winner is...

01:18:10.119 --> 01:18:11.986
Poppy Benson...

01:18:12.088 --> 01:18:14.455
of Poppy's Petals!

01:18:14.557 --> 01:18:17.792
Wonderful! Congratulations!

01:18:49.859 --> 01:18:51.992
I'm sorry I didn't win,
Blair, I...

01:18:52.095 --> 01:18:54.595
- I know you're disappointed.
- No, no, dear.

01:18:54.697 --> 01:18:58.632
No. I am so proud of what
you've done here today.

01:18:58.735 --> 01:19:00.634
I really am.

01:19:00.737 --> 01:19:04.071
And you will always be
my winner.

01:19:04.173 --> 01:19:08.242
I am so sorry
for how badly I behaved.

01:19:08.344 --> 01:19:13.147
Good, because I'm gonna be
around for a while longer.

01:19:13.249 --> 01:19:16.383
Five years with or without
the promise of a partnership.

01:19:16.486 --> 01:19:18.018
Yeah, no.

01:19:18.121 --> 01:19:20.187
Now that you've had
a taste of being in charge,

01:19:20.289 --> 01:19:22.323
you would be insufferable

01:19:22.425 --> 01:19:24.425
and I couldn't possibly
keep you around.

01:19:24.527 --> 01:19:26.527
I, I don't understand.

01:19:26.629 --> 01:19:28.763
I think it's time that you
submit your resignation

01:19:28.865 --> 01:19:31.198
to Covington, for good.

01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:33.634
- So you're, you're firing me?
- No.

01:19:33.736 --> 01:19:36.871
I'm telling you to go off and be
the second-best florist

01:19:36.973 --> 01:19:38.939
in Santa Mesa.

01:19:39.041 --> 01:19:43.544
Well, can I keep
all my long-term clients?

01:19:46.115 --> 01:19:47.782
Thank you for teaching me
so well.

01:19:47.884 --> 01:19:49.416
Yeah. Maybe too well.

01:19:53.055 --> 01:19:54.355
Yes.

01:19:54.457 --> 01:19:56.357
You know, I guess,
maybe what we've learned

01:19:56.459 --> 01:20:00.327
is that a little healthy
competition never hurt anybody.

01:20:05.268 --> 01:20:07.601
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:20:07.703 --> 01:20:09.837
I suppose I should go
be gracious

01:20:09.939 --> 01:20:12.940
and congratulate the woman
who beat Covington

01:20:13.042 --> 01:20:15.142
finally after all these years.

01:20:17.547 --> 01:20:21.282
And I'll see you both
at next year's competition.

01:20:24.821 --> 01:20:26.453
You're still number one
in our book.

01:20:26.556 --> 01:20:28.055
Thanks, squad.

01:20:30.793 --> 01:20:32.293
I just wanted to offer you
my sincere

01:20:32.395 --> 01:20:33.928
congratulations, Miss Benson.

01:20:34.030 --> 01:20:36.297
Thank you.

01:20:39.468 --> 01:20:41.535
Well, I was wondering
if I could speak with you

01:20:41.637 --> 01:20:43.404
in private for a moment, dear?

01:20:45.007 --> 01:20:47.441
- I've got your back.
- Thank you.

01:20:53.883 --> 01:20:55.850
I haven't exactly been,

01:20:55.952 --> 01:20:58.419
kind to you throughout
this competition, dear.

01:20:58.521 --> 01:20:59.720
Not exactly.

01:20:59.822 --> 01:21:01.166
But that's because
I thought you were

01:21:01.190 --> 01:21:04.225
trying to distract Garrett
from winning.

01:21:04.327 --> 01:21:06.560
No, you're wrong.

01:21:06.662 --> 01:21:08.963
Either way,
I owe you an apology.

01:21:09.065 --> 01:21:10.664
Apology accepted.

01:21:10.766 --> 01:21:13.234
I'm too much of a fan
of yours not to, you know.

01:21:13.336 --> 01:21:15.502
Thank you, dear.

01:21:15.605 --> 01:21:18.239
And you know, I'm not
the only one with a fan here.

01:21:18.341 --> 01:21:21.809
Garrett really does care
for you, and I'm just so sorry

01:21:21.911 --> 01:21:24.845
that I...
that I just deceived you

01:21:24.947 --> 01:21:26.380
into thinking that he doesn't.

01:21:26.482 --> 01:21:27.848
No, that's okay.

01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:29.383
I feel like
I already knew he did.

01:21:29.485 --> 01:21:31.285
I was just, I don't know,

01:21:31.387 --> 01:21:33.921
too insecure
to believe it until now.

01:21:34.023 --> 01:21:35.322
Okay, good.

01:21:37.093 --> 01:21:39.426
Do me a favor
and tell your friends

01:21:39.528 --> 01:21:41.061
I was just awful with you.

01:21:41.163 --> 01:21:43.230
I do have a reputation
to uphold.

01:21:43.332 --> 01:21:45.499
Okay.

01:21:45.601 --> 01:21:46.934
Thank you.

01:21:56.012 --> 01:21:57.344
Yeah, sweetie.

01:21:57.446 --> 01:22:00.347
I'm so stinkin' excited for us!

01:22:00.449 --> 01:22:02.394
Wait, does this mean I can add
Award-Winning Florist

01:22:02.418 --> 01:22:03.317
to my resume?

01:22:03.419 --> 01:22:05.286
Yes!

01:22:06.889 --> 01:22:08.188
Hey, you.

01:22:10.626 --> 01:22:12.927
Congratulations.

01:22:13.029 --> 01:22:15.062
Looks like that multitasking
finally paid off.

01:22:15.164 --> 01:22:16.063
Thank you.

01:22:16.165 --> 01:22:17.831
Is it stupid that I'm also

01:22:17.934 --> 01:22:19.533
incredibly sad you didn't win?

01:22:19.635 --> 01:22:21.335
No, you're not.

01:22:21.437 --> 01:22:22.437
But that's okay.

01:22:22.471 --> 01:22:23.737
Can I be both?

01:22:23.839 --> 01:22:25.873
You know, in a way, I feel like

01:22:25.975 --> 01:22:28.042
I kind of did win today.

01:22:29.211 --> 01:22:30.878
Yeah? Why?

01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:34.448
Well, because I finally got you
under the mistletoe.

01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:25.499
Look who it is.

01:23:25.601 --> 01:23:26.767
Hey!

01:23:27.903 --> 01:23:29.870
Merry Christmas!

01:23:32.608 --> 01:23:33.807
Lovely.

01:23:35.044 --> 01:23:36.510
Beautiful.

01:23:36.612 --> 01:23:37.678
Thank you. Hi.

01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:39.580
Hello.

01:23:39.682 --> 01:23:41.382
And a Merry Christmas.

01:23:42.718 --> 01:23:44.650
Would you like an eggnog?
