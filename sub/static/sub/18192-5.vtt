Not that kind of counsellor, David.
Marriage guidance.

01:46.600 --> 01:48.556

Well, in your shoes, l shouldn't.

01:58.840 --> 02:00.796
l just think it would be a good idea to talk.

02:00.880 --> 02:04.077
- l've made an appointment for Tuesday.
- l've got other plans.

02:04.160 --> 02:06.116
What?

02:07.360 --> 02:08.793
l'll think of something.

02:08.880 --> 02:12.031
David, we have to discuss this.
You can't just walk away!

02:13.560 --> 02:15.596
What do you mean? Of course it was a comedy.

02:15.680 --> 02:17.636
lngmar Bergman does not make comedies.

02:17.720 --> 02:20.280
Well, he should. He clearly has a talent for it.

Can you wait until l've finished?

02:31.680 --> 02:34.433
- Well, l'm not getting in your way.
- Yes, you are.

02:38.520 --> 02:43.150

there'll be a water shortage before you finish.

Yeah, baked-bean box. Friday...

03:05.960 --> 03:08.394
See that thing on TV last night?

03:08.480 --> 03:12.155
Oh, no. Of course you didn't.
You still go out, don't you?

03:12.240 --> 03:15.596
We went to the cinema.
We saw my favourite film.

03:16.800 --> 03:19.473
- Adam liked it, too.
- What was the last...l think...

03:19.560 --> 03:22.199
What did l see at the cinema?

03:22.280 --> 03:25.795
Oh, yeah. lt had Kevin Costner in it.
lt was all right.

03:25.880 --> 03:27.632
That must have been a while ago.

03:27.720 --> 03:32.430
Yeah.
Now we just stay in, eat crap and watch TV.

03:32.520 --> 03:35.159
Very much like being in an old people's home.

03:36.920 --> 03:39.673
You could do something else.
You don't have to watch telly.

03:39.760 --> 03:41.557
Like what?

03:41.640 --> 03:42.868
- Book?
- A book?

03:42.960 --> 03:46.839
Yeah. Start with a newspaper.
Work your way up.

03:46.920 --> 03:49.229
Jen, by the time l've put Adam to bed,

03:49.320 --> 03:52.392
l'm so knackered l can barely speak,
let alone read.

03:53.360 --> 03:55.396
What about a game? Yeah?

03:55.480 --> 03:57.118
Yes! A game!

03:57.200 --> 03:58.918
Yeah!

03:59.000 --> 04:02.117
- Question Of Sport's on. Brilliant.
- (Groans)

04:02.200 --> 04:07.149
The other night, l was on the phone to my mum,
and she always asks after my friends.

04:07.240 --> 04:13.076
And apart from you and Adam,
l don't seem to see them any more...

04:14.360 --> 04:18.956
Look, Rachel,
l was trying to think of some news, right,

04:19.040 --> 04:22.031
and l found myself telling her
about what was happening to Ken.

04:22.120 --> 04:25.317
- Ken?
- Barlow. Coronation Street.

04:25.400 --> 04:28.915
- Oh, he's having a hard time, isn't he?
- He is an' all, yeah.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.877
l think you really do need to get out more.

04:30.960 --> 04:33.838
l can't. l'd...l'd miss him.

04:33.920 --> 04:36.229
l suppose that's what they invented the video for.

04:36.320 --> 04:38.515
Not Ken. The baby.

04:38.600 --> 04:41.990
Anyway, l know it's daft, but l just...

04:42.080 --> 04:44.355
l feel funny about leaving him with a stranger.

04:44.440 --> 04:46.192
- l'll do it.
- Yeah?

04:46.280 --> 04:48.840
- Yeah.
- What about Adam?

04:48.920 --> 04:53.277
l'll do it on my own. To be honest,
l wouldn't mind spending an evening on my own.

04:54.600 --> 04:58.036
Adam's really irritating me at the moment.

04:58.120 --> 05:00.031
She's really irritable at the moment.

05:00.120 --> 05:02.395
- Rachel?
- Yeah.

05:02.480 --> 05:04.198
Maybe she's bored.

05:04.280 --> 05:07.397
Of Adam Williams? l don't think so.

05:07.480 --> 05:10.916
Well...you've got to keep things lively.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.310
When was the last time
that you bought her a...

05:14.400 --> 05:16.311
a surprise pressie?

05:16.400 --> 05:18.470
When was the last time you surprised Jenny?

05:18.560 --> 05:21.233
- Tonight.
- Oh, Pete's back!

05:21.320 --> 05:26.440
Listen. The strop she's in, if l bought her
a present, she'd probably exchange it.

05:26.520 --> 05:29.318
There you go, mate. You can't go wrong.
Say it with flowers.

05:29.400 --> 05:34.428
No, hay fever. Besides, she'd probably think
l was feeling guilty about something.

05:34.520 --> 05:36.397
- Are you?
- God, l bloody wish.

05:36.480 --> 05:39.552
l haven't done anything wrong,
but l can't do anything right.

05:39.640 --> 05:42.393
lt's not his fault. He hasn't changed.

05:43.480 --> 05:46.119
That's the problem. He never changes.

05:46.200 --> 05:49.078
Does Pete have any annoying little habits?

05:49.160 --> 05:52.038
<i>Pete is an annoying little habit.</i>

05:52.120 --> 05:53.758
But l'm addicted.

05:53.840 --> 05:57.594
- (Baby gurgles)
- Aren't l?

05:57.680 --> 06:02.515
lt's like Adam can't even eat a peanut
without it almost hitting the ceiling first.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.069
(Laughs)

06:05.160 --> 06:07.071
ls that so annoying?

06:07.160 --> 06:09.116
<i>RACHEL: It can be.</i>

06:15.680 --> 06:19.229
<i>Or there's the way
he'II Ieave things in the fridge for months.</i>

06:19.320 --> 06:21.709
- Hey, hey, what are you doing?
- lt's out of date.

06:21.800 --> 06:24.473
- Yeah, hardly.
- Er...by more than a week.

06:25.400 --> 06:27.789
That might have been the cure for something.

06:31.080 --> 06:35.358
Look, Rach, l just think
you need to do some stuff without him.

06:35.440 --> 06:39.274
You know, get a hobby. Something of your own.

06:39.360 --> 06:43.194
- Have you ever seen Adam jogging?
- Oh, very funny! (Laughs)

06:43.280 --> 06:45.475
Yeah. Precisely.

06:45.560 --> 06:49.997
Jogging's good. Yeah.
Mind you, at your age, you want to be careful.

06:53.320 --> 06:57.472
- Hello.
- Jen! Jenny, Jen, come on.

06:57.560 --> 06:59.232
- What?
- l've got a surprise for you.

06:59.320 --> 07:02.437
- Yeah?
- Oh, surprises.

07:02.520 --> 07:05.193
OK. Sit yourself down there, love.

07:05.280 --> 07:07.077
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

07:07.160 --> 07:10.709
Watch. One, two, three...

07:11.920 --> 07:14.229
..four, five...

07:14.320 --> 07:15.548
six!

07:16.440 --> 07:18.670
- Ha!
- So? (Chuckles)

07:18.760 --> 07:20.716
Doesn't that say anything to you?

07:20.800 --> 07:22.995
Yeah, there's nothing on, as usual. Come on.

07:23.080 --> 07:25.753
We've got cable! Ha!

07:25.840 --> 07:28.434
- What?
- 50 channels!

07:28.520 --> 07:33.275
Four film, three sports, two news,
and wait till you see this...

07:33.360 --> 07:35.316
<i>(Music starts)
- Country-music videos.</i>

07:35.400 --> 07:37.550

07:37.640 --> 07:39.596
<i>Well, aren't you surprised?</i>

07:39.680 --> 07:44.196
Pete, we watch too much telly as it is, love.
What were you thi... Why?

07:45.280 --> 07:47.111
The choice!

07:47.200 --> 07:49.031
Great.

07:49.120 --> 07:51.873
50 channels of crap, instead of five.

07:53.320 --> 07:56.392
- Who are you phoning?
- Rachel.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.356
She said she'd baby-sit.

07:59.440 --> 08:01.749
l'll see if she's free tomorrow night.

08:01.840 --> 08:03.796
l'll beg if l bloody have to.

08:05.080 --> 08:06.195
Rach...

08:09.200 --> 08:12.397
How about a white Burgundy?

08:12.480 --> 08:15.074
- Don't they do beer?
- No.

08:15.160 --> 08:19.312
Well, only in bottles.
No, you've got to trust me on this, Adam.

08:19.400 --> 08:22.198
They have a rather interesting
Château Montrachet.

08:22.280 --> 08:24.430
lt's a bit pricey, but worth it.

08:24.520 --> 08:26.476
Thank you.

08:28.040 --> 08:30.634
Well, this is nice.

08:30.720 --> 08:32.472
Lovely.

08:36.919 --> 08:39.592
ls there anything specific
you wanted to talk about?

08:39.679 --> 08:42.148
- No.
- lt's just, when you rang, l thought...

08:42.240 --> 08:45.789
No, no. lt's just...l thought
we hadn't seen each other for a while.

08:46.720 --> 08:49.188
- Since the weekend.
- ls it?

08:56.840 --> 08:59.229
Mmm. Very good. Thank you.

09:10.280 --> 09:12.077
Mmm.

09:15.200 --> 09:16.872
<i>Karen busy tonight?</i>

09:16.960 --> 09:19.520
Yes, she's seeing our counsellor.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.909
Oh,
Rachel said you'd had problems with your bins.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.356
No, it's er...marriage guidance.

09:25.440 --> 09:28.637
Oh...l didn't know
you were going to marriage guidance.

09:28.720 --> 09:32.190
<i>- Well, I'm not.
- lsn't it the kind of thing you do together?</i>

09:32.280 --> 09:37.479
l am not prepared to sit there while a do-gooding
social worker sticks their nose into our affairs.

09:37.560 --> 09:40.632
Do you count them as affairs?
Neither of you actually shagged...

09:43.440 --> 09:46.557
<i>Well, l know I'd be there.
l mean, who's gonna fight your corner?</i>

09:46.640 --> 09:48.198
What do you mean?

09:48.280 --> 09:50.953
Well, it's like not being represented in court,
isn't it?

09:51.040 --> 09:54.271
<i>I mean, Karen's gonna be accusing you
of every crime under the sun.</i>

09:54.360 --> 09:57.352
<i>Desertion, mentaI crueIty...</i>

09:57.440 --> 09:59.032
trying to shag the nanny.

09:59.120 --> 10:03.432
And the marriage-guidance counsellor,
who you can lay your life on will be a woman,

10:03.520 --> 10:06.751
<i>weII, she's gonna come down on Karen's side
every time.</i>

10:06.840 --> 10:08.512
l hadn't thought of it like that.

10:08.600 --> 10:11.956
Well, before you know it,
they'll be burning you in effigy.

10:12.040 --> 10:14.713
Oh, you want to get down there, mate,
put a stop to it.

10:16.600 --> 10:17.715
Yeah, thanks.

10:20.200 --> 10:22.919
- Thanks, Adam.
- Any time, mate.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.956
- Your bill, sir.
- Thank you.

10:29.160 --> 10:31.355
What? Are you wise?

10:47.040 --> 10:49.349
David, you've come.

10:49.440 --> 10:51.396
So it would appear.

10:58.760 --> 11:00.716
So, you haven't started without me?

11:01.960 --> 11:03.916
lt should be a couple of minutes.

11:07.600 --> 11:11.115
Tell me, is our counsellor a man or a woman?

11:11.200 --> 11:13.555
- A woman.
- Mm-hm.

11:20.960 --> 11:24.669
The moment she uses the word ''facilitate'',
l'm out of here.

11:24.760 --> 11:26.716
(Door opens)

11:28.600 --> 11:30.556
(Man sobbing)

11:33.320 --> 11:36.153
Mr and Mrs Marsden?
Would you like to come this way?

11:49.720 --> 11:51.915
l'm glad you were able to join us, Mr Marsden.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.231
Your wife told me on the phone
you sometimes had to work late.

11:55.320 --> 11:58.153
Well, that hardly amounts to desertion.

11:58.240 --> 12:00.595
Please...do sit down.

12:05.560 --> 12:08.233
Er...that's my chair.

12:10.400 --> 12:14.359
- Perhaps l'll stand.
- You might be more comfortable sitting.

12:14.440 --> 12:16.510
Or maybe not.

12:16.600 --> 12:21.469
Now, first, let me explain
that my job is not to prescribe, but to facilitate...

12:21.560 --> 12:22.913
(Groans)

12:23.000 --> 12:26.197
..to enable you to understand
any problems you might be having.

12:26.280 --> 12:28.555
Yeah, l've got a question.

12:28.640 --> 12:30.198
<i>- Are you married?
- David!</i>

12:30.280 --> 12:33.590
<i>- It's a perfectIy reasonabIe enquiry.
- l'm terribly sorry.</i>

12:33.680 --> 12:36.240
lt's just,
l noticed you're not wearing a wedding ring.

12:36.320 --> 12:37.639
l'm a widow.

12:39.760 --> 12:42.115
But prior to my husband's death,
we were separated.

12:42.200 --> 12:45.829
Ah! So, what makes you think
you're qualified to do this job?

12:45.920 --> 12:47.433
30 years' experience.

12:48.600 --> 12:50.556
l suppose that could count for something.

12:50.640 --> 12:54.110
Now, we tend to see clients
in blocks of six sessions.

12:54.200 --> 12:57.715
Six?
God, l was hoping we could sort this out tonight.

12:57.800 --> 12:59.711
You may find it takes a little longer.

12:59.800 --> 13:02.314
Particularly if you keep interrupting, David.

13:02.400 --> 13:05.949
Now, perhaps we should start
by you each telling me why you're here.

13:06.040 --> 13:07.553
Duress?

13:08.880 --> 13:10.836
Mrs Marsden, would you like to begin?

13:12.640 --> 13:13.595
Erm...

13:13.680 --> 13:16.274
<i>Er...David and I began having...</i>

13:16.360 --> 13:18.635
American degrees - are they valid here?

13:20.840 --> 13:24.515
- l think our problems began when David and l...
- Anyone mind if l open the window?

13:24.600 --> 13:25.999
Mr Marsden, please!

13:29.360 --> 13:31.316
<i>You were saying?</i>

13:33.360 --> 13:35.715
Erm...David and l
began having problems when...

13:35.800 --> 13:37.472
(Alarm)
- Fire alarm!

13:37.560 --> 13:39.915
lt's not a fire alarm. lt's a panic button.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.390
Well, l'm in a panic.
Time to evacuate the building. Come on, Karen.

13:43.480 --> 13:44.913
- No!
- Come on!

13:48.680 --> 13:49.795
Don't move!

13:49.880 --> 13:51.916
Are you all right, Janet?

13:53.280 --> 13:55.236
lt must be very difficult for you.

14:03.200 --> 14:05.156
(Doorbell)

14:09.320 --> 14:11.276
(Suavely) Hello.

14:12.440 --> 14:13.395
Hi.

14:13.480 --> 14:16.358
Emma. From next door.

14:17.920 --> 14:20.957
Oh, yeah. Sorry.
l didn't recognise you without your clothes on.

14:21.040 --> 14:23.873
- ls Rachel in?
- Rachel? Rachel?

14:23.960 --> 14:25.598
<i>- Hi! I'm ready.
- Ah, Rachel.</i>

14:25.680 --> 14:28.558
- Hi, Emma. Hello.
- Where are you going?

14:28.640 --> 14:31.029
- Take a wild guess.
- Katmandu.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.588
- Three-mile run.
- Oh. So, when did you start running?

14:33.680 --> 14:35.716
- l haven't yet.
- Bye.

14:41.520 --> 14:44.910
l think l considered having an affair
because erm...

14:45.000 --> 14:47.389
l was seeking attention.

14:47.480 --> 14:50.233
David's so preoccupied with work,
he never pays me any.

14:50.320 --> 14:53.710
l see. And how would you respond to that,
David?

14:57.360 --> 15:00.557
<i>(GoIf commentary on radio)
- Er...</i>

15:04.800 --> 15:07.439
<i>- Sorry.
- l can't believe you just did that.</i>

15:07.520 --> 15:09.476
lt's the PGA Masters.

15:13.440 --> 15:17.877
Your wife was suggesting that you perhaps
don't pay her as much attention as you used to.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.916
Oh, l think that's a little unfair.

15:21.080 --> 15:24.072
- l never forget your birthday.
- lt's on New Year's Day.

15:24.160 --> 15:26.435
And l love you now
as much as the day we married.

15:26.520 --> 15:29.353
- When was that, David?
- 22nd September '92.

15:29.440 --> 15:33.831
The FTSE 1 00 hit an all-time high.
lt was the happiest day of my life.

15:33.920 --> 15:37.276
- Because of the stock market?
- Because l married Karen.

15:38.360 --> 15:40.874
Why don't you tell me how you met?

15:46.360 --> 15:49.113
David came to my rescue.

15:49.200 --> 15:54.069
Erm...l went to a party with some friends,
and er...

15:55.160 --> 15:58.835
..this guy asked me to dance, which was fine.

15:58.920 --> 16:04.438
And er...he started groping me.
l think he'd had a bit too much to drink.

16:04.520 --> 16:09.799
And l tried to push him off,
but he was too strong, and er...

16:11.160 --> 16:13.833
..l suddenly heard this voice behind me.

16:13.920 --> 16:16.195
- ''Can l be of any assistance?''
- (Laughs)

16:18.000 --> 16:22.152
l remember thinking to myself,
''What a ludicrously gallant turn of phrase.''

16:23.720 --> 16:25.676
Anyway, there was a fight.

16:26.640 --> 16:31.270
Not much of one,
because er...David did karate at college.

16:33.960 --> 16:35.916
And it was all wildly romantic.

16:38.600 --> 16:39.828
We were then.

16:40.880 --> 16:42.199
What about sex?

16:44.160 --> 16:47.277
- Not that first night, no.
- No, l mean generally.

16:48.920 --> 16:49.989
(Sighs)

16:50.080 --> 16:52.116
She wanted you to talk about sex?

16:52.200 --> 16:54.270
lt's like discussing it with your mother.

16:54.360 --> 16:57.875
Hmm. So, what did you say?

16:57.960 --> 16:59.951
l passed it over to Karen.

17:00.040 --> 17:01.837
Good call.

17:03.680 --> 17:07.275
- What do you want to know?
- Whatever you like. Nothing, if you'd prefer.

17:07.359 --> 17:11.194
- Sounds good.
- No, David. This is important.

17:12.680 --> 17:16.036
Erm...l think when we were first married...

17:16.119 --> 17:18.236
<i>we had a very active sex Iife.</i>

17:19.720 --> 17:21.278
We made love all over the house.

17:21.359 --> 17:24.113
We must have had sex,
what, eight or nine times a week?

17:33.680 --> 17:35.636
Of course, we do it less now.

17:36.840 --> 17:39.229
lt's still good, though, isn't it?

17:39.320 --> 17:43.108
- Yeah...apart from when you were impotent.
- lmpotent?

17:43.200 --> 17:45.430
- lmpotent?
- Of course she'd pick up on that.

17:45.520 --> 17:47.397
You were impotent?

17:47.480 --> 17:49.436
Just briefly, but l'm fine now.

17:50.920 --> 17:52.876
And so's sex.

17:55.040 --> 17:56.712
lf a little routine.

17:59.160 --> 18:02.232
You said earlier that you used to be romantic.
You're not now?

18:02.320 --> 18:04.754
<i>- No.
- CouId you be again?</i>

18:05.840 --> 18:06.795
How?

18:06.880 --> 18:08.677
Well, you could start dating.

18:08.760 --> 18:11.320
- What, other people?
- No. One another.

18:11.400 --> 18:13.914
- You go out on a date with Karen?
- Yeah.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.833
- Well, at least you'll be on a promise.
- (Laughs)

18:16.920 --> 18:20.913
You know, in a funny sort of way, l miss dating.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.195
Yeah. The thrill of the chase.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.476
♪ Benny Hill-style music

18:41.000 --> 18:45.551
Look, you know the way you find yourself
attracted to other women?

18:45.640 --> 18:47.756
- Yeah.
- What, someone at work, is it?

18:47.840 --> 18:49.796
- Next-door neighbour.
- Oh!

18:49.880 --> 18:51.632
Ask me how old she is.

18:51.720 --> 18:53.950
- How old is she?
- She's 1 8.

18:54.040 --> 18:55.792
Ohh! (Laughs) No?

18:55.880 --> 18:57.836
Rachel went jogging with her last night.

19:53.640 --> 19:56.473
l only went halfway, and l walked most of that!

So...another drink?

22:55.240 --> 22:57.117
Er, Neil, this is David.

22:58.200 --> 22:59.519
Your date?

23:01.840 --> 23:06.550
We didn't think you were coming...
and at least one of us was hoping you weren't.

23:06.640 --> 23:09.279
- lt was nice meeting you.
- And you.

23:13.360 --> 23:17.273
- Who was that?
- Neil. He's in marketing.

23:17.360 --> 23:19.635
So, tell me, David, what do you do?

23:19.720 --> 23:21.995

<i>- Where's your wedding ring?
- l didn't think l should wear it...on a first date.</i>

23:37.160 --> 23:39.594
Now, are you going to go and get us a drink?

23:41.600 --> 23:43.670
Where are you going?

23:43.760 --> 23:45.910
- To get the drinks.
- You don't know what l want.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.468
- You always have a spritzer.
- lt's our first date.

23:48.560 --> 23:50.551
And at this rate, there won't be a second.

23:52.160 --> 23:54.674

And God willing,
we'll have something to talk about.

- Why?

25:49.520 --> 25:51.636
Cos we will want to invite Karen.

25:51.720 --> 25:55.679
And what will that look like, if you go out with
Adam and have fun, and leave David at home?

25:55.760 --> 25:57.751
Well, from my perspective, much better.

25:57.840 --> 26:01.753
Eh...you know.
Remember when you were little...

26:01.840 --> 26:03.717

26:03.800 --> 26:05.756
<i>Hmm?</i>

27:03.040 --> 27:04.917
- No.
- Yes, you have!

27:05.000 --> 27:07.719
l wouldn't admit that on a first date -
it might put you off.

27:07.800 --> 27:09.631
You can't pretend Josh doesn't exist.

27:55.120 --> 27:56.473
OK.

27:57.320 --> 27:59.276
(Heavy rock music)

27:59.360 --> 28:02.272
- (Laughing) Adam!
- Hi, Rach. Hi.

28:02.360 --> 28:04.191
- Are you pissed?
- Stoned.

28:04.280 --> 28:05.952
- Stoned?
- And pissed.

28:06.040 --> 28:07.598
l thought you wanted to work.

28:07.680 --> 28:12.674
Oh...l've been out with Emma.
We...had a couple of joints.

28:12.760 --> 28:14.478
And then a couple more.

28:14.560 --> 28:17.279
- l hope you didn't drive.
- Oh, of course l didn't drive!

28:17.360 --> 28:20.830
- Well, you took the car.
- Yes, and l left it in town.

28:20.920 --> 28:22.592
- Jesus!
- Somewhere.

28:22.680 --> 28:24.875
What?

28:24.960 --> 28:27.076
Hi, Emma. (Turns music down)

28:27.160 --> 28:29.799
- What are you doing?
- What about the neighbours?

28:29.880 --> 28:31.393
<i>l am the neighbours.</i>

28:31.480 --> 28:34.916
- Yeah. Well, l mean, Elsie's 80.
- Yeah, and she's deaf.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.309
Will you just stop acting like my father?

28:37.400 --> 28:39.118
<i>Will you stop acting like a teenager?</i>

28:39.200 --> 28:40.428
Oi!

28:40.520 --> 28:42.954
No, teenager isn't in it. You're acting like a child.

28:54.800 --> 28:56.074
She hit him?

28:56.160 --> 29:00.551
Just the once. l think. l was stoned.

29:00.640 --> 29:04.349
- What happened then?
- Well...

29:04.440 --> 29:06.158
as l remember it...

29:10.280 --> 29:12.032
(Clang)

29:13.200 --> 29:15.873
Right. Nice one.

29:15.960 --> 29:19.077
l think we'd better get Rachel's version on this.

29:19.160 --> 29:20.513
There you go.

29:20.600 --> 29:23.558
Hey, Rach,
how did Adam react when you hit him?

29:26.480 --> 29:29.153
Ah. Er...well...

29:30.640 --> 29:32.358
Are you getting your period?

29:32.440 --> 29:34.556
<i>Oh, no!</i>

29:34.640 --> 29:36.676
- Offside. Referee! Sorry.
- Are you?

29:36.760 --> 29:40.116
l think l must be, because then l hit him again.

29:41.360 --> 29:42.998
<i>So it was twice?</i>

29:44.280 --> 29:46.919
<i>And then l got reaIIy angry.</i>

29:47.000 --> 29:51.039
You are such an old fart!
God, you were born middle-aged.

29:51.120 --> 29:53.793
''Turn the music down.
Where's the car? Did you lock it?''

29:53.880 --> 29:56.758
l didn't ask you that... Did you?

29:57.920 --> 30:03.199
Look, l'm just as young as you. Not in years,
maybe, but inside. l'm young at heart, me.

30:03.280 --> 30:05.748
At least l don't have to hang out
with girls half my age.

30:05.840 --> 30:07.398
l have a natural rapport with youth.

30:07.480 --> 30:10.358
- Oh, right. Like with you and Emma?
- Yeah, well, we get on.

30:10.440 --> 30:13.000
Oh, you'll be telling me next
that she fancies you.

30:19.360 --> 30:23.399
- Emma, do you fancy Adam?
- Adam?

30:23.480 --> 30:25.436
- Yeah. Cardigan man.
- Cardigan man?

30:25.520 --> 30:27.431
l don't understand the question.

30:27.520 --> 30:31.399
Well, no. l mean, l understand the question.
l just...l don't get it.

30:33.840 --> 30:36.912
lf you saw me in a club, what would you think?

30:41.200 --> 30:44.192
Well, that you'd come to pick up your daughter.

30:44.280 --> 30:46.236
<i>(Women Iaughing)</i>

30:50.040 --> 30:51.871
You still haven't got over it, have you?

30:51.960 --> 30:54.758
No, l couldn't believe it.
lt was like a slap in the face.

30:54.840 --> 30:59.391
Yeah, and you'd know.
Still, she has got a point, you know. We are old.

30:59.480 --> 31:01.914
<i>You are. l've still got some years in me.</i>

31:02.000 --> 31:03.877
Hi, chaps. Sorry l'm late. Same again?

31:03.960 --> 31:06.235
Yeah.

31:06.320 --> 31:09.915
You invited David? On a wild night out?

31:11.640 --> 31:14.154
Come on, Adam.
You know what it was like at school,

31:14.240 --> 31:16.196
and no-one wanted you on the team.

31:19.880 --> 31:22.553
- That's a hat trick for Georgie Best!
- (Cheering)

31:24.960 --> 31:27.997
ALL: Well done, Adam! Well done!

31:30.720 --> 31:33.473
No, l don't suppose you do.

31:33.560 --> 31:35.676
Oh, this is going to be a great evening.

31:35.760 --> 31:38.149
Here we go. The first of many.

31:38.240 --> 31:41.596
Right.
What are we gonna do tonight, then, girls?

31:41.680 --> 31:44.433
Oh, this woman at work's invited me to her party.

31:44.520 --> 31:49.275
What, a real one? What, with dancing
and drinking and snogging and everything?

31:49.360 --> 31:51.271
- What's the occasion?
- Her divorce.

31:51.360 --> 31:53.396
Oh, great. That sounds like fun.

31:53.480 --> 31:55.277
Oh, go on. We've got nothing else to do.

31:55.360 --> 31:58.033
Go on. Let's get the vibe going!

31:58.160 --> 32:00.913
Look, l don't know
why we couldn't stay at the Nag's Head.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.230
Cos it isn't a pub crawl if you only go to one pub.

32:03.320 --> 32:06.630
- But we've been past five.
- Yeah, well, they all looked dead.

32:06.720 --> 32:09.075
- lt was quite lively in there.
- There was a fight!

32:09.160 --> 32:11.071
l haven't been on a pub crawl for years.

32:11.160 --> 32:14.994
Hey, l know a drinking game. First pub
you go into, you have pints. Or is it shorts?

32:15.080 --> 32:18.117
- Look, here's one. This'll do.
- And each of you steals a bar mat.

32:18.200 --> 32:21.636
No, that's a bit easy.
lt's a towel from the top of the bar.

32:21.720 --> 32:23.676
(Heavy rock music)

32:29.080 --> 32:31.640
- What was wrong with that one?
- There was no-one there!

32:31.720 --> 32:35.110
- There was someone at the bar.
- That was the barman!

32:35.200 --> 32:37.555
- Oh, yeah.
- Look, lads. Listen.

32:37.640 --> 32:40.632
- Tonight's supposed to be special. Right?
- Yeah.

32:41.720 --> 32:43.676
Follow me.

32:44.720 --> 32:46.995
No, l've got it. One of you steals the bar towel...

32:47.080 --> 32:49.036
(Booming techno music)

32:59.000 --> 33:01.958
This place? You're having a laugh.

33:02.040 --> 33:04.554
lt's not even a pub, is it?

33:04.640 --> 33:07.552
Why don't we go back to the last one?
lt might have filled up.

33:07.640 --> 33:09.631
Pubs, my arse. This is the place.

33:09.720 --> 33:12.188
This is the place.

33:12.280 --> 33:16.114
Look...have you ever taken ecstasy?

33:18.000 --> 33:19.672
Ecstasy?

33:20.760 --> 33:22.910
Yeah...no.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.230
No. No, exactly. No, nor has Rachel.

33:25.320 --> 33:27.151
- So?
- So...

33:27.240 --> 33:28.798
Take ecstasy?

33:28.880 --> 33:31.440
Well, you wanted a few tales
to take home to Jenny.

33:31.520 --> 33:33.238
<i>I'm not taking ecstasy!</i>

33:33.320 --> 33:36.517
l'm a management consultant.
A father. Respectable.

33:36.600 --> 33:39.273
<i>- Are you respectable?
- Well, l'm a father.</i>

33:39.360 --> 33:44.070
Oh, come on, guys!
Let's let our hair down, while we still have some.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.309
Trust me...

33:47.400 --> 33:48.799
l'm lrish.

33:48.880 --> 33:50.836
(Techno music)

33:58.200 --> 34:00.634
(Laughing)

34:00.720 --> 34:04.429
- Rachel, babe! You made it!
- l brought some friends. You don't mind?

34:04.520 --> 34:07.080
No, the more the merrier. Come on!

34:08.320 --> 34:10.072
Wow! How do you know so many men?

34:10.159 --> 34:13.914
l don't. But by the end of the evening, l intend to.

34:15.639 --> 34:17.596
Hey!

34:20.920 --> 34:23.831
- Where the hell are we gonna get E from?
- Them.

34:23.920 --> 34:27.230
Oh, it's a well-known fact.
Bouncers are a major source of supply.

34:29.440 --> 34:31.748
All right, lads? Are you carrying anything?

34:31.840 --> 34:33.876
No, but l'm sure you could help us out there.

34:33.960 --> 34:34.995
Eh?

34:35.080 --> 34:38.152
No, it's OK. We're cool. We know the score.

34:38.239 --> 34:41.596
- Are you after something?
- Yeah. Two tabs of E.

34:44.400 --> 34:46.469
You're joking?

34:46.560 --> 34:49.279
Yes! He's joking. He's a joker!

34:50.280 --> 34:52.714
Oh, right. A comedian.

34:52.800 --> 34:54.313
Yeah.

34:56.560 --> 34:58.073
Thanks.

34:59.800 --> 35:01.711
- Sorry, mate.
- What?

35:01.800 --> 35:04.189
- You can't come in.
- Why not?

35:05.240 --> 35:08.869
- But he's with us.
- Yeah? Well, you two were borderline.

35:08.960 --> 35:11.474
Er...no, Adam, really, l don't mind.

35:11.560 --> 35:13.630
- No, no, come on. Let him in.
- No, really.

35:13.720 --> 35:15.995
<i>- Do you want to leave as well?
- Maybe we should...</i>

35:16.080 --> 35:19.470
Listen, chaps. You go in. You know. l'll be fine.

35:19.560 --> 35:21.676
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah. l'll ring Karen.

35:21.760 --> 35:24.320
You know... See what the girls are up to.

35:24.400 --> 35:26.118
OK. Come on.

35:26.200 --> 35:29.556
ADAM: Oh, my God!

35:29.640 --> 35:32.154
- ls that a bloke or a woman?
- l've no idea.

35:32.240 --> 35:36.392
- No-one's drinking alcohol. You know why?
- Yeah, er...well, they're all driving.

35:36.480 --> 35:40.553
No, water stops you overheating.
We, my friend, are in the land of E.

35:40.640 --> 35:42.596
(Pounding techno music)

35:51.560 --> 35:53.869
So, are you and David all right now?

35:53.960 --> 35:56.520
We're getting there,
but the flame's still burning low.

35:56.600 --> 35:59.592
Well, the amount of time you've been together,
it's bound to.

35:59.680 --> 36:01.636
You reckon?

36:02.960 --> 36:04.757
Go on! Ride me like a Derby winner!

36:08.080 --> 36:10.435
Rach, is it OK if l piss off?

36:10.520 --> 36:12.431
Oh, is it not really your scene?

36:12.520 --> 36:14.431
No, l understand. Bye.

36:14.520 --> 36:15.873
Take care.

36:15.960 --> 36:19.270
- Hi. Remember me?
- Hi! Yeah, it's Neil.

36:19.360 --> 36:22.079
- Good to see you again. Hi. How are you?
- Hello.

36:22.160 --> 36:24.355
(Music starts)
- Oh, l love this song.

36:24.440 --> 36:26.590
Shall we?

36:26.680 --> 36:28.636
Yeah, OK.

36:30.240 --> 36:32.196
Oh...

36:32.280 --> 36:35.670
- Oh, allow me.
- Oh, sorry. Hello.

36:35.760 --> 36:38.672
- Hi. Gavin.
- Hello. Nice to meet you.

36:38.760 --> 36:41.672
- Sorry. What was your name, again?
- Oh, sorry. Rachel.

36:41.760 --> 36:43.671
- Oh, hi.
- Hello.

36:43.760 --> 36:45.671
Er...can l get you another drink?

36:45.760 --> 36:47.990
Erm...actually, l'm fine.

36:48.080 --> 36:50.674
OK. Right.

37:28.400 --> 37:31.790
- Two bottles of water, please.
- Four quid.

37:31.880 --> 37:33.836
No, water.

37:35.320 --> 37:36.514
Bargain.

37:36.600 --> 37:38.556
(Techno music)

38:12.640 --> 38:15.154
Look. There's one. Come on.

38:20.560 --> 38:22.596
Er...a couple of Es?

38:22.680 --> 38:25.194
- Yeah, no problem. That's 20 quid.
- Er...right.

38:25.280 --> 38:27.919
Come on, come on.
Discretion's the name of the game.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.560
- All right. Sorry.
- Right. There you go. Get buzzing.

38:30.640 --> 38:32.198
OK.

38:37.280 --> 38:39.191
You first.

38:45.160 --> 38:46.798
No, together.

38:56.040 --> 39:01.239
l mean, when you take delivery of a new Merc,
it makes all the years at college worthwhile.

39:01.320 --> 39:03.834
l mean, people think insolvency's dull,

39:03.920 --> 39:07.549
but, you know, we're making decisions
every day that'll change people's lives.

39:07.640 --> 39:10.438
Do we close the business down,
or keep it open,

39:10.520 --> 39:13.159
running up losses,
then sell it off as a going concern?

39:13.240 --> 39:15.071
lt's cutting-edge stuff.

39:15.160 --> 39:20.075
l mean, just last week l was in this factory in
Oldham, where they manufacture paper clips...

39:20.160 --> 39:23.152
- l'm just going to get some more wine.
- No, no. There's some here.

39:23.240 --> 39:26.596
- Oh...thanks.
- Yeah. Paper clips and staples.

39:26.680 --> 39:30.229
Not the guns. The actual staples themselves.

39:32.120 --> 39:34.395
- Do you want to get some air?
- (Laughing)

39:37.520 --> 39:40.193
- No, no, no. This way.
- More...more air there.

39:40.280 --> 39:42.316
We can always open a window! Come on.

39:42.400 --> 39:44.550
Oh, l was having a lovely time! (Laughs)

39:44.640 --> 39:46.392
- Please, talk to me.
- Pardon?

39:46.480 --> 39:50.075
- Er...who are you? What do you do?
- Luke. l'm a solicitor.

39:50.160 --> 39:53.709
(Laughs) Solicitor!

39:53.800 --> 39:56.439
Well, it beats insolvency.

39:56.520 --> 39:58.476
(Ambient tune)

40:13.040 --> 40:15.474
(Pounding techno)

40:21.800 --> 40:23.756
Do you feel anything?

40:26.760 --> 40:28.398
That dealer's a wanker.

40:28.480 --> 40:31.313
Come on. Shift. We've been done.

40:32.840 --> 40:35.798
l thought it was odd that they were sugar-coated.

40:35.880 --> 40:38.519
Ah, that's so that they appeal to children.

40:39.520 --> 40:42.159
God, what would Rachel say
if she was here now?

40:42.240 --> 40:46.870
Erm...she'd probably say,
''What am l doing here in the gents' toilets?''

40:47.960 --> 40:51.919
l hate it when she's off me. l can't eat.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.956
That's love, mate.

40:55.280 --> 40:57.271
l'm only here for her, you know.

40:57.360 --> 41:01.319
l wanted to prove
that l'm not what she thinks l am.

41:02.920 --> 41:04.876
Come on.

41:06.040 --> 41:07.951
Do you want to go home?

41:08.040 --> 41:13.831
No, no. Let's split up, spread out,
and find a real dealer. Come on.

41:17.760 --> 41:21.196
Yeah.
l'd say nine out of ten defendants are guilty.

41:21.280 --> 41:25.592
l mean, if they hadn't been up to something,
they wouldn't be in the dock, would they?

41:25.680 --> 41:27.636
The public hasn't got a clue.

41:27.720 --> 41:30.393
Their idea of the law comes from TV.

41:30.480 --> 41:32.550
Totally unrealistic.

41:32.640 --> 41:34.471
l mean, The Bill - that's not bad.

41:34.560 --> 41:37.518
But it's about the only series
that's ever got it right.

41:37.600 --> 41:40.956
- (Chuckles)
- What's so funny?

41:41.040 --> 41:43.634
- My boyfriend.
- Eh?

41:43.720 --> 41:46.473
Cop shows used to be good.
l mean, what about The Sweeney?

41:46.560 --> 41:49.438
Dennis Waterman
should have been arrested for that haircut.

41:49.520 --> 41:51.636
- Sorry?
- (As Regan) Shut it!

41:58.280 --> 42:00.111
- You're a great dancer.
- Yeah!

42:00.200 --> 42:02.395
l'd be even better if you gave me a bit of room.

42:02.480 --> 42:03.913
- Come on.
- What?

42:04.000 --> 42:07.993
- Well, you know you want to.
- What? No. Get off, Neil! Get off!

42:08.080 --> 42:10.036
Can l be of any assistance?

42:11.840 --> 42:13.273
(Crash)

42:13.360 --> 42:16.670
David...take me home.

42:17.920 --> 42:19.558
Gladly.

42:21.120 --> 42:23.076
(Techno music)

42:32.080 --> 42:35.755
- l've just seen my next-door neighbour.
- The one whose girlfriend smacked him?

42:35.840 --> 42:38.149
Yeah. l wonder what he's doing here.

42:46.120 --> 42:48.076
Hey, Adam...

42:51.840 --> 42:54.798
- So, smack is heroin?
- Yeah.

42:54.880 --> 42:58.316
- Then l've found our dealer.
- Heroin? We don't want any of that crap.

42:58.400 --> 43:02.598
No, no. l'm sure he'll have something softer -
you know, for beginners.

43:02.680 --> 43:04.750
- Brilliant.
- This way.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.878
There. Him. That one.
The one with the silly jazz-beard thing.

43:11.960 --> 43:14.349
- Oh, my God. That's Emma.
- Who?

43:14.440 --> 43:17.830
- Our next-door neighbour.
- Oh, the one you fancy?

43:17.920 --> 43:20.832
<i>PETE: I see what you mean.
She was the one taIking about heroin!</i>

43:20.920 --> 43:23.593
- Her.
- God! She's only 1 8!

43:23.680 --> 43:26.752
- Hey, no, don't. Adam!
- Pete, get off! Get off.

43:26.840 --> 43:30.469
<i>- Here, what's going on?
- Adam! lt is you. What brings you here?</i>

43:30.560 --> 43:32.391
- A zimmer frame?
- Don't push it!

43:32.480 --> 43:34.357
- Yeah...
- Pusher.

43:34.440 --> 43:36.510
- Are you on something?
- No!

43:36.600 --> 43:38.716
- Do you wanna be?
- What, like smack?

43:38.800 --> 43:41.712
- Adam? Does Rachel know?
- No, but l'm gonna tell her.

43:41.800 --> 43:43.995
Good. They say that's the first step to recovery.

43:44.080 --> 43:47.550
l hate to break up your touching scene,
but we were about to do some business.

43:48.560 --> 43:49.834
You bollocks!

43:49.920 --> 43:51.114
(Groans)

43:51.200 --> 43:53.270
Oi! Come here, you!

43:54.720 --> 43:56.676
(Screaming)

44:02.280 --> 44:04.510
- Here you are, mate.
- What? What? What?

44:04.600 --> 44:07.034
- Hold these.
- Get off!

44:07.120 --> 44:10.157
(Shouting)

44:10.240 --> 44:12.196
Come here.

44:17.920 --> 44:19.876
You're nicked.

44:28.520 --> 44:30.954
Hey, Emma, get me a lawyer. Tell Rachel.

44:31.040 --> 44:32.996
Don't tell Jenny!

44:36.800 --> 44:38.756
(Siren)

44:47.520 --> 44:50.114
(Drunkenly) Hey! Hey, wait.

44:50.200 --> 44:52.760
We've got to stop now.

44:52.840 --> 44:54.796
Eh?

44:56.480 --> 44:59.358
No. No, l'm married.

44:59.440 --> 45:01.556
That's OK. l was once.

45:01.640 --> 45:03.949
No...

45:04.040 --> 45:08.192
No, l'm happily married. l've got a baby.

45:08.280 --> 45:10.794
Yeah. Hey, do you want to see a photo?

45:10.880 --> 45:14.668
- No. Not really.
- Yeah. Hang on.

45:14.760 --> 45:17.672
Right. Look.

45:17.760 --> 45:20.399
Hey...there they are.

45:20.480 --> 45:23.040
That's Pete, that one there.

45:23.120 --> 45:25.111
My...man.

45:25.200 --> 45:27.031
l think l'm gonna find my mates.

45:27.120 --> 45:31.591
He's four months old. Bye-bye! Bye-bye, Mam.

45:31.680 --> 45:33.636
Hello, Pete, love.

45:36.080 --> 45:37.195
Sorry.

45:37.280 --> 45:44.436
So, just how did 1 40 ecstasy tablets
come to be in your possession?

45:45.480 --> 45:49.758
- This bloke gave them to me.
- Oh, ''this bloke''?

45:49.840 --> 45:55.472
Come on, son. Don't waste my time.
Your mate's told us everything.

45:55.560 --> 45:59.235
- Adam?
- Singing like Whitney Houston.

46:00.720 --> 46:03.917
lt was all his idea.

46:04.000 --> 46:05.956
Now we're getting somewhere.

46:12.040 --> 46:15.191
Luke Stubbings.
Your girlfriend asked me to come and see you.

46:15.280 --> 46:18.556
- Are you a solicitor?
- Almost. Doing articles.

46:19.600 --> 46:21.556
l say, this is a bit gloomy, isn't it?

46:24.160 --> 46:27.072
Have you been in a police cell before, Luke?

46:27.160 --> 46:30.357
l can't say l have. l mainly do conveyancing.

46:32.680 --> 46:38.391
The bag was in your hand.
Your muscle was on the floor, scrapping!

46:38.480 --> 46:40.152
What was it? A turf war?

46:40.240 --> 46:42.674
Muscle? Adam?

46:42.760 --> 46:45.320
Not very convincing muscle.

46:45.400 --> 46:48.358
- You don't deny it, then?
- No. Yes.

46:48.440 --> 46:50.829
Look, l've told you. You've got the wrong person.

46:50.920 --> 46:53.309
l've nothing to hide.

46:53.400 --> 46:55.356
Well, let's see, shall we?

47:02.320 --> 47:05.710
So, have you ever done this sort of thing before?

47:05.800 --> 47:08.758
- l'm innocent.
- (Laughs) Yeah, right!

47:08.840 --> 47:10.796
OK. You're free to go.

47:12.920 --> 47:14.876
Thank God.

47:21.880 --> 47:23.472
What about my mate?

47:23.560 --> 47:26.358
What, Howard Marks in there?
He's just getting dressed.

47:26.440 --> 47:27.714
Dressed?

47:27.800 --> 47:30.234
A witness came forward.

47:30.320 --> 47:32.231
Emma Townsend.

47:32.320 --> 47:35.949
<i>Testified that you two were trying
to break up a drug deal, not make one.</i>

47:36.040 --> 47:39.715
Officially, we don't condone vigilantes.

47:39.800 --> 47:41.791
But personally, well...

47:41.880 --> 47:44.678
l admire anyone
who's prepared to make a stand.

47:44.760 --> 47:46.716
Thanks.

48:00.680 --> 48:02.910
Thank God! Are you all right?

48:03.000 --> 48:04.956
Fine.

48:06.040 --> 48:09.919
Great solicitor.
l thought you wanted me sent down for life.

48:10.000 --> 48:13.390
No. l want you back home.

48:14.880 --> 48:16.916
Safe and sound in your cardie.

48:17.000 --> 48:20.754
(Groans) l'm not Cardigan Man!
l don't even have a cardie.

48:20.840 --> 48:23.195
- l'll buy you one.
- Mmm.

48:38.200 --> 48:41.158
No! You told her?

48:41.240 --> 48:42.958
l don't think she'll remember.

48:53.880 --> 48:55.711
ADAM: That was quite a laugh, wasn't it?

48:55.800 --> 48:58.360
PETE:
For the muscle, maybe, but not for Mr Big.

49:01.400 --> 49:03.311
Why are you walking like that?

49:03.400 --> 49:07.279
Don't ask. Right? Just don't ask.
