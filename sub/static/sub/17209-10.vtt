WEBVTT

00:04.146 --> 00:05.580
Food, food!

00:05.582 --> 00:07.149
Not our food.

00:07.150 --> 00:09.852
Hey, we ordered before they did.

00:09.853 --> 00:12.486
Hey, here's the thing... they tip.

00:13.922 --> 00:15.556
Greetings, chaps.

00:17.259 --> 00:20.494
What are you, the Not-So-Great Gatsby?

00:21.263 --> 00:22.765
Those are nice binoculars.

00:22.766 --> 00:25.734
What are you, looking at stuff?

00:25.735 --> 00:27.175
These are for my bird-watching club.

00:27.176 --> 00:28.436
Now that I'm single,
I'm trying to meet women

00:28.437 --> 00:29.404
with similar interests

00:29.405 --> 00:31.306
in the hopes of finding my perfect mate.

00:31.307 --> 00:33.375
Oh.

00:33.376 --> 00:34.643
You're dating again.

00:34.644 --> 00:36.912
Good... that's great.

00:36.913 --> 00:39.882
Yes, I am able to since
you broke up with me.

00:39.883 --> 00:41.650
So...

00:41.651 --> 00:44.453
lucky me, I guess.

00:44.454 --> 00:46.488
I didn't mean for it to sound like I...

00:46.489 --> 00:48.524
I am just glad that
you're able to date again

00:48.525 --> 00:49.724
after I...

00:50.759 --> 00:52.261
Order up for Emily.

00:52.262 --> 00:53.928
Oh, order up for me, gotta go.

00:55.264 --> 00:56.999
So, have you met anyone yet?

00:57.000 --> 01:00.169
Well, to be honest, it has
been fairly slim pickings.

01:00.170 --> 01:01.270
Felix!

01:01.271 --> 01:04.973
You just missed a
white breasted nuthatch!

01:04.974 --> 01:06.909
Thank you, Muriel.

01:06.910 --> 01:08.577
Muriel, these are my friends, who can

01:08.578 --> 01:10.813
keep their opinions to themselves.

01:10.814 --> 01:11.680
Hello.

01:11.681 --> 01:12.481
Hi.

01:12.482 --> 01:13.782
Excuse me,

01:13.783 --> 01:16.350
I need to use the little girls' room.

01:18.220 --> 01:19.620
An older lady, all right.

01:20.823 --> 01:22.558
Can't put a price on experience, because

01:22.559 --> 01:25.459
that would cost a fortune.

01:27.362 --> 01:29.464
Top-notch jibes, top-notch.

01:29.465 --> 01:30.985
But it's not so easy looking for love,

01:30.986 --> 01:33.250
and I'm not going to find my
soul mate by sitting at home

01:33.251 --> 01:34.952
and polishing my fiddle.

01:37.206 --> 01:40.041
Which is not a euphemism.

01:40.042 --> 01:42.066
Listen, dating doesn't
have to be that complicated.

01:42.067 --> 01:43.567
Watch.

01:50.720 --> 01:51.854
I'm Michelle.

01:51.855 --> 01:53.255
Want to get out of here?

01:53.256 --> 01:55.357
Yeah, yeah.

01:55.358 --> 01:56.725
You want me to write that down?

01:56.726 --> 01:57.826
I'm good.

01:57.827 --> 01:58.894
Okay.

01:58.895 --> 02:00.462
Felix,

02:00.463 --> 02:02.264
there are a lot of ways to meet people.

02:02.265 --> 02:04.900
In this new world, all you
have to do is use technology.

02:04.901 --> 02:06.068
What are you doing?

02:06.069 --> 02:08.502
I just took your profile pic.

02:08.503 --> 02:10.639
You just joined a new
app called Seek-A-Boo.

02:10.639 --> 02:13.275
No... I'm not going to search
for women on the Internet

02:13.276 --> 02:16.544
like the way I shop for
vintage German vacuum parts.

02:17.679 --> 02:19.214
This app works.

02:19.215 --> 02:20.816
I had three dates last week...

02:20.817 --> 02:24.186
steak, duck, and I'm seeing
lobster again tonight.

02:24.187 --> 02:25.921
Dating is a numbers game.

02:25.922 --> 02:27.745
Do you know how many
women I had to go through

02:27.746 --> 02:28.724
before I met Charlotte?

02:28.725 --> 02:31.258
Yes... our bedrooms are
right next to each other.

02:33.528 --> 02:34.463
Muriel,

02:34.464 --> 02:36.198
may I escort you home?

02:36.199 --> 02:40.568
Oh, Felix, I'm flattered, but
I just don't see you that way.

02:43.572 --> 02:47.202
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<font color="#33FF00"><b>awaqeded</b></font> for <font color="#33FF00"><b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

02:49.244 --> 02:50.579
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

02:50.580 --> 02:52.047
- I'm headed up to my place.
- Okay.

02:52.048 --> 02:53.715
Oh, um...

02:53.716 --> 02:55.584
I'll take a rain check.

02:55.585 --> 02:57.368
I mean, you've brushed
your teeth, I haven't.

02:57.369 --> 02:58.854
It's not a level kissing field.

02:58.855 --> 03:00.522
You know, if you want, you could leave

03:00.523 --> 03:02.090
your toothbrush here,

03:02.091 --> 03:03.725
right in this thing.

03:03.726 --> 03:05.760
Felix says it's more
than just a beer holder.

03:07.262 --> 03:08.963
That's okay.

03:11.333 --> 03:12.768
Oh, come on.

03:12.769 --> 03:14.512
We've been dating each
other for six months.

03:14.513 --> 03:16.605
We've named each other's naughty parts.

03:16.606 --> 03:18.407
Good morning, Dani.

03:18.408 --> 03:20.741
I didn't hear the bad thing.

03:23.045 --> 03:25.480
So you really don't want to
leave your toothbrush here?

03:25.481 --> 03:26.515
I've got my routine.

03:26.516 --> 03:27.482
I'll see you later.

03:27.483 --> 03:28.716
Bye, Dani.

03:29.618 --> 03:32.087
Mmm.

03:32.088 --> 03:35.891
What, "Mmm" about the toothbrush thing?

03:35.892 --> 03:37.659
I don't want to get involved.

03:37.660 --> 03:39.083
But you're saying there's something

03:39.084 --> 03:40.189
not to get involved in.

03:40.190 --> 03:43.031
I'm not saying anything.

03:43.032 --> 03:45.100
I'm just saying.

03:45.101 --> 03:48.203
Well, well, say what you're saying.

03:48.204 --> 03:49.838
Okay.

03:49.839 --> 03:51.742
I was watching a nature
program the other night,

03:51.743 --> 03:53.241
and when a penguin gives a pebble

03:53.242 --> 03:55.877
to another penguin, it
signifies a serious commitment.

03:55.878 --> 03:57.479
What?

03:57.480 --> 04:00.548
I'm not sure Charlotte
wants your pebble.

04:02.651 --> 04:04.119
Oh, you don't know anything.

04:04.120 --> 04:05.520
Charlotte and I are great.

04:05.521 --> 04:06.754
Mmm.

04:09.124 --> 04:11.493
What's wrong with my pebble?

04:11.494 --> 04:13.862
Ah, checking out your
new dating app, huh?

04:13.863 --> 04:16.765
Well, curiosity got the better of me,

04:16.766 --> 04:17.899
but it's ridiculous.

04:17.899 --> 04:19.500
I mean, how is one supposed to choose

04:19.502 --> 04:20.885
between thousands of random women?

04:20.886 --> 04:23.505
As God intended... by
physical appearance.

04:23.506 --> 04:24.773
Oscar,

04:24.774 --> 04:26.875
that is no way to start a
real, meaningful relationship.

04:26.876 --> 04:28.077
Well, you shouldn't be looking

04:28.078 --> 04:29.578
to get into a relationship right now.

04:29.579 --> 04:31.346
They're really confusing.

04:31.347 --> 04:32.814
Is everything okay with Charlotte?

04:32.815 --> 04:34.850
Yeah, I think so.

04:34.851 --> 04:37.185
Women are very hard to read.

04:37.186 --> 04:39.888
Just like books.

04:39.889 --> 04:41.757
I'm looking for that one to curl up with

04:41.758 --> 04:43.291
for the rest of my life.

04:43.292 --> 04:46.194
No, don't be looking to
settle down right now.

04:46.195 --> 04:48.797
You should just go out, meet
someone, and have a good time.

04:48.798 --> 04:50.966
If, by "good time,"
you mean casual sex...

04:50.967 --> 04:52.834
I do.

04:52.835 --> 04:55.337
...then count me out.

04:55.338 --> 04:56.721
I have never had a one-night stand,

04:56.722 --> 04:58.243
and I don't intend to start right now.

04:58.244 --> 04:59.187
And what are you doing?

04:59.188 --> 04:59.841
Look at her.

04:59.842 --> 05:01.510
She seems nice.

05:01.511 --> 05:06.014
Well, yes, but how do I know
if we have anything in common?

05:06.015 --> 05:07.049
Well, you're about to find out.

05:07.050 --> 05:08.617
You're meeting her for drinks tonight.

05:08.618 --> 05:10.379
I can't go on a date
with some strange woman.

05:10.380 --> 05:12.363
Well, you could stand her
up, but that wouldn't be

05:12.364 --> 05:13.255
very gentlemanly.

05:13.256 --> 05:16.625
Oscar, there is no way...

05:16.626 --> 05:18.193
Here's a picture of her in a bikini.

05:18.194 --> 05:20.427
Well, I am a gentleman.

05:22.000 --> 05:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:30.539 --> 05:32.541
- Uh, Eve?
- Yes.

05:32.542 --> 05:33.708
Hello.

05:33.709 --> 05:36.810
I am Felix Unger, from the Internet.

05:38.818 --> 05:40.348
Can I get you something to drink?

05:40.349 --> 05:42.150
Gin and tonic.

05:42.151 --> 05:44.919
I will have same, with just
a passing mention of lime.

05:45.554 --> 05:47.054
Little bit of lime.

05:49.991 --> 05:51.126
So,

05:51.127 --> 05:52.727
your profile said you're a photographer.

05:52.751 --> 05:54.062
You know, Eve, I thought, um,

05:54.063 --> 05:57.632
instead of small talk
tonight, we could try this.

05:57.633 --> 05:58.934
It is a series

05:58.935 --> 06:00.702
of 36 questions designed
by a psychologist

06:00.703 --> 06:01.703
to accelerate intimacy

06:01.704 --> 06:03.905
and determine long-term compatibility.

06:03.906 --> 06:05.774
Oh, I don't know if I want to do that.

06:05.775 --> 06:07.576
Question number one.

06:07.577 --> 06:10.077
When did you last weep, and why?

06:12.614 --> 06:14.249
Thank you.

06:14.250 --> 06:17.185
Could you get started
on my next one, please?

06:17.186 --> 06:19.855
Oh, question 17... this is a fun one.

06:19.856 --> 06:22.591
Have you ever thought about
how and when you will die?

06:22.592 --> 06:26.795
Yeah, since question three.

06:26.796 --> 06:28.463
I need to go to the ladies' room.

06:28.464 --> 06:30.831
- Oh.
- I'll be right back.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.707
Oh, she's just going to the bathroom.

06:38.708 --> 06:40.451
Oh, God, I hope not,
because she's out there

06:40.452 --> 06:42.277
on the sidewalk.

06:42.278 --> 06:44.513
Oh, well, maybe she
needed some fresh air.

06:44.514 --> 06:47.149
She's waving at a taxi.

06:47.150 --> 06:50.785
She probably knows that taxi driver.

06:50.786 --> 06:52.320
And now she's getting in the taxi.

06:52.321 --> 06:54.456
And the taxi's driving away.

06:54.457 --> 06:58.160
You may remove her drink.

06:58.161 --> 06:59.694
By the way, climbing a volcano.

06:59.695 --> 07:01.196
I'm sorry, what?

07:01.197 --> 07:03.365
Question 12... what's the
wildest thing you ever did?

07:03.366 --> 07:04.699
Oh, really?

07:04.700 --> 07:05.534
Yeah.

07:05.535 --> 07:06.268
A volcano.

07:06.269 --> 07:08.103
How daring.

07:08.104 --> 07:09.738
Oh, I'm-I'm Felix, by the way.

07:09.739 --> 07:11.972
Natasha.

07:16.845 --> 07:18.446
I think I have a new answer

07:18.447 --> 07:19.714
for question 12.

07:33.322 --> 07:34.956
Say, Felix?

07:34.957 --> 07:38.026
Didn't we have the
yodeling conversation?

07:38.027 --> 07:41.329
Sorry, Oscar, it's just
hard to contain my jubilance.

07:41.330 --> 07:42.597
Ah, your date went well.

07:42.598 --> 07:44.332
Well, you know that
I never kiss and tell,

07:44.333 --> 07:46.634
but I had sex last night,
which involved a lot of kissing,

07:46.635 --> 07:47.802
and now I am telling you.

07:47.803 --> 07:50.672
Congratulations, buddy.

07:50.673 --> 07:51.973
My first one-night stand.

07:51.974 --> 07:54.141
I'm a hound.

07:55.210 --> 07:57.645
Hey, don't forget, I'm
the one who picked her out.

07:57.646 --> 08:01.014
So I hope you thought of me
last night while you two were...

08:02.016 --> 08:03.284
Never mind.

08:03.285 --> 08:05.220
Actually, Oscar, it wasn't
the woman you picked.

08:05.221 --> 08:07.155
She wasn't my type.

08:07.156 --> 08:08.623
Ran out on you, did she?

08:08.624 --> 08:10.758
Like there was a fire drill.

08:10.759 --> 08:12.727
But then I struck up a conversation

08:12.728 --> 08:14.362
with the bartendress.

08:14.363 --> 08:16.965
Shot down, and he
soldiers on and gets up

08:16.966 --> 08:18.600
- to make me breakfast.
- Actually, no.

08:18.601 --> 08:19.781
This is for Natasha and me.

08:21.069 --> 08:22.369
She's still here?

08:23.338 --> 08:24.706
And you're making her breakfast?

08:24.707 --> 08:26.808
That's not the way
one-night stands work.

08:26.809 --> 08:29.609
You don't feed 'em.

08:30.945 --> 08:32.679
Oscar, I'm a gentleman,

08:32.681 --> 08:34.344
and as such I can't
allow a guest to leave

08:34.345 --> 08:35.984
without offering them a proper meal.

08:35.985 --> 08:39.854
Hey...

08:39.855 --> 08:42.222
Natasha,

08:42.224 --> 08:44.259
this is my roommate, Oscar.

08:44.260 --> 08:47.195
Hey...

08:47.196 --> 08:49.497
Your place is amazing.

08:49.498 --> 08:50.898
I share a shoebox

08:50.899 --> 08:52.533
with, like, three other people.

08:52.534 --> 08:56.103
34, and I've got a bathtub
in my kitchen, what?

08:57.772 --> 09:00.441
Anyway, fun night, Felix.

09:00.442 --> 09:01.776
I'll see you around.

09:01.777 --> 09:02.744
- Natasha?
- Don't.

09:02.745 --> 09:04.078
Would you care to...

09:04.079 --> 09:05.213
Do not.

09:05.214 --> 09:06.447
...stay for breakfast?

09:06.448 --> 09:07.681
You did.

09:09.617 --> 09:11.185
Sure.

09:11.186 --> 09:12.920
I mean, who turns down a free meal?

09:12.921 --> 09:14.589
Wonderful.

09:14.590 --> 09:18.226
Oh, Felix, this looks really nice.

09:18.227 --> 09:19.661
Well, thank you for saying so.

09:19.662 --> 09:20.795
See, it's fine.

09:20.796 --> 09:23.264
Make it quick... one egg and out.

09:23.265 --> 09:25.667
Well.

09:25.668 --> 09:27.411
I hope you like
fresh-squeezed orange juice.

09:27.412 --> 09:30.680
Sneak a little vodka in there,
you've got yourself a deal!

09:38.046 --> 09:39.380
Seems like the coast is clear.

09:39.381 --> 09:42.549
Did Natasha egg it and leg it?

09:43.618 --> 09:46.621
Came up with that one on the walk home.

09:46.622 --> 09:48.222
Actually, um...

09:48.223 --> 09:50.591
Oh... my... God!

09:50.592 --> 09:52.527
That whirlpool bathtub

09:52.528 --> 09:55.630
was fantastic!

09:55.631 --> 10:00.101
I almost just proposed
to one of your air jets.

10:00.102 --> 10:04.105
You're still here, and you're bathing.

10:04.106 --> 10:05.940
You know what?

10:05.941 --> 10:07.809
It is such a beautiful day out,

10:07.810 --> 10:11.112
I think I'm gonna go lay out
on the balcony for a while.

10:11.113 --> 10:13.414
Lie... objects lay, people lie.

10:13.415 --> 10:15.717
Okay, cool.

10:15.718 --> 10:17.485
So when's the wedding?

10:17.486 --> 10:19.487
What am I supposed to do?
I can't get her to leave.

10:19.488 --> 10:21.723
That's why you're not
supposed to feed them!

10:21.724 --> 10:25.827
Now she's topless...
she's on the balcony

10:25.828 --> 10:27.995
without a top!

10:27.996 --> 10:30.198
Hey, Oscar, we need
to call the network...

10:30.199 --> 10:32.033
Nope, don't need to see that.

10:32.034 --> 10:35.002
I'm not going to get my eyes clawed out.

10:35.003 --> 10:37.271
Damn my chivalry!

10:37.272 --> 10:40.041
I am too nice to get rid of her.

10:40.042 --> 10:41.876
Luckily,

10:41.877 --> 10:43.678
I'm not.

10:43.679 --> 10:46.614
Natasha, may I speak
to you for a moment?

10:46.615 --> 10:48.615
What up, dude?

10:50.818 --> 10:56.891
I just think it might be breast
if... best if you were to...

10:56.892 --> 10:58.292
Oscar?

10:58.293 --> 10:59.594
Oh, my God, it's Charlotte!

10:59.595 --> 11:01.596
- Who's Charlotte? Hi!
- Get down!

11:01.597 --> 11:03.498
Get down!

11:03.499 --> 11:06.166
Not what it looks like.

11:07.135 --> 11:08.903
That's Felix's one-night stand,

11:08.904 --> 11:10.772
and I was not staring at her chest.

11:10.773 --> 11:12.539
Except for one, but that's it.

11:14.175 --> 11:16.210
Okay, I believe you.

11:16.211 --> 11:17.645
You do?

11:17.646 --> 11:19.480
'Cause I'm telling the truth,

11:19.481 --> 11:21.149
and I don't even buy it.

11:21.150 --> 11:22.350
It's okay.

11:22.351 --> 11:24.018
You can stare at naked women all day

11:24.019 --> 11:25.253
if you want.

11:25.254 --> 11:26.287
You don't care?

11:26.288 --> 11:27.822
What's going on with you?

11:27.823 --> 11:28.990
Nothing... what?

11:28.991 --> 11:30.934
Well, first you won't
leave your toothbrush here,

11:30.935 --> 11:32.318
then you don't mind if I'm staring

11:32.319 --> 11:34.986
at another woman's breasts,
which I did not, except for one.

11:36.330 --> 11:38.032
Are you checking out
of our relationship?

11:38.033 --> 11:39.533
No.

11:40.902 --> 11:42.603
Okay.

11:42.604 --> 11:44.739
I did get a little
rattled when you asked me

11:44.740 --> 11:46.374
to leave my toothbrush here.

11:46.375 --> 11:49.911
Why? What, what do you
think I'm gonna do with it?

11:49.912 --> 11:52.013
Nothing.

11:52.014 --> 11:53.948
It's just leaving my toothbrush here

11:53.949 --> 11:56.050
and getting upset if you
stare at another woman...

11:56.051 --> 11:58.052
they're signs that
we're getting serious.

11:58.053 --> 12:00.388
And the last serious
relationship I was in

12:00.389 --> 12:02.056
was my marriage, and I got crushed,

12:02.057 --> 12:04.826
and I just want to be careful.

12:04.827 --> 12:07.929
Look, I got burned by
my last divorce, too.

12:07.930 --> 12:11.232
Literally, she... she threw soup at me.

12:13.469 --> 12:16.537
But let's not let our
past screw up our future.

12:16.538 --> 12:21.242
Okay, I will gladly
leave my toothbrush here.

12:21.243 --> 12:26.747
And as for looking at
breasts, eyes down here, buddy.

12:26.748 --> 12:30.050
Allow me to take you all out to lunch.

12:32.987 --> 12:36.791
Oh, good, you are robed.

12:36.792 --> 12:37.792
That makes sense.

12:37.793 --> 12:41.929
It is getting awfully late.

12:41.930 --> 12:43.965
I agree.

12:43.966 --> 12:45.399
- You do?
- Yes!

12:45.400 --> 12:46.400
It's lunchtime.

12:46.401 --> 12:48.736
I'm starving.

12:48.737 --> 12:51.038
Ooh!

12:51.039 --> 12:53.140
Chips and salsa?

12:53.141 --> 12:55.743
I didn't know you were Spanish.

12:55.744 --> 12:59.580
Oh, Natasha, you know, it's
funny... there's so much

12:59.581 --> 13:01.449
that I don't know about you.

13:01.450 --> 13:02.783
Like, um, oh, anything.

13:02.784 --> 13:05.786
For example, if you were
to go home right now,

13:05.787 --> 13:06.821
how would you do that?

13:06.822 --> 13:09.857
By, um, subway or taxi or...

13:09.858 --> 13:11.526
Could you open this for me?

13:12.794 --> 13:15.329
Wow.

13:15.330 --> 13:16.830
So strong.

13:17.765 --> 13:19.933
Yes, I do Pilates.

13:21.602 --> 13:26.840
And, um... hot yoga.

13:30.311 --> 13:35.850
You're, like, the nicest guy ever.

13:35.851 --> 13:37.217
I know.

13:39.487 --> 13:40.655
Here we go.

13:40.656 --> 13:43.024
I was scared of combining our lives,

13:43.025 --> 13:44.892
but knowing you want it as much as I do

13:44.893 --> 13:46.327
makes me feel good.

13:46.328 --> 13:49.062
Here's to our future together.

13:55.803 --> 13:57.071
We did it!

13:57.072 --> 13:58.705
We sure did!

14:01.309 --> 14:03.576
Oh, my God, what have I done?

14:11.850 --> 14:13.483
Hiya, hot stuff!

14:14.987 --> 14:16.354
Well.

14:16.355 --> 14:19.324
It is nice to see you in
the hand-woven dress shirt

14:19.325 --> 14:21.660
that I was saving for
a special occasion.

14:21.661 --> 14:24.162
Hey, you're still here.

14:24.163 --> 14:26.597
And you're wearing
a shirt... that's new.

14:27.599 --> 14:30.235
Oh, sorry, babe, I didn't
know you were there.

14:30.236 --> 14:32.838
Yeah, I'm always here.

14:32.839 --> 14:34.773
Just like you are.

14:34.774 --> 14:37.876
And your toothbrush.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.511
Oh, you brought your own toothbrush?

14:39.512 --> 14:41.179
That's so smart.

14:41.180 --> 14:43.047
I just borrowed Felix's.

14:45.584 --> 14:47.452
Nope, keep it... just keep it.

14:47.453 --> 14:49.888
You know, I was thinking
maybe I should leave

14:49.889 --> 14:52.758
a few other things here,
like some face wash,

14:52.759 --> 14:53.892
maybe a robe.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.728
Oh, a robe.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.731
So now we're in my closet.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.366
That's nice.

15:01.367 --> 15:03.602
Felix, maybe

15:03.603 --> 15:05.537
I should leave some stuff here.

15:06.973 --> 15:09.574
Oh, and I could bring my dog, too!

15:09.575 --> 15:11.443
Of course then I'd have to bring my cat.

15:11.444 --> 15:12.944
They're like brother and sister.

15:12.945 --> 15:15.680
There you go... nice
quick breakfast bar.

15:15.681 --> 15:17.482
Don't want you to be late for work.

15:17.483 --> 15:19.818
Oh, no worries, I took the day off

15:19.819 --> 15:22.754
so I could hang with my baby.

15:22.755 --> 15:26.057
Please tell me you have an actual baby.

15:26.058 --> 15:27.392
And maybe I could leave

15:27.393 --> 15:28.727
some almond milk in your fridge.

15:28.728 --> 15:32.130
And now you're in my kitchen.

15:32.131 --> 15:33.198
Are you okay?

15:33.199 --> 15:34.099
No.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.534
No, no, I'm not!

15:35.535 --> 15:37.536
You're smothering me,
you're smothering me!

15:37.537 --> 15:38.769
What?

15:41.373 --> 15:44.176
Baby, they don't have what we have.

15:44.177 --> 15:45.944
Agreed.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.813
I'm just going to check
on him very quickly.

15:47.814 --> 15:49.246
Oh.

15:55.754 --> 15:57.022
Hello, all.

15:57.023 --> 15:59.057
Ah, you can have my seat, Felix.

15:59.058 --> 16:00.258
I'm gonna call it a day.

16:00.259 --> 16:03.093
Okay.

16:06.097 --> 16:08.132
I was actually just stretching.

16:09.134 --> 16:11.902
You know what, sure.

16:12.971 --> 16:14.639
Well, I think I shall join you all

16:14.640 --> 16:16.141
in quaffing a cold one.

16:16.142 --> 16:17.775
You don't quaff beer.

16:18.643 --> 16:20.545
He's avoiding Natasha.

16:21.547 --> 16:24.081
That is silly and very accurate.

16:24.843 --> 16:26.266
Felix, you haven't kicked that girl

16:26.267 --> 16:27.452
to the curb yet?

16:27.453 --> 16:29.588
Oh, I can't... to be honest,

16:29.589 --> 16:31.223
I've never ended it with a woman before.

16:31.224 --> 16:32.424
I usually become overbearing,

16:32.425 --> 16:35.293
and they leave me, if
you can believe that.

16:35.294 --> 16:37.195
I can.

16:37.196 --> 16:38.463
So, what am I supposed to do?

16:38.464 --> 16:40.465
Felix, the way you break up with someone

16:40.466 --> 16:42.133
is by being brutally honest.

16:42.134 --> 16:44.436
Like last night, I said,
"Dear, I'm only on this date

16:44.437 --> 16:47.339
because I want that lobster."

16:47.340 --> 16:49.140
Well, I hope you did it after dinner.

16:49.141 --> 16:51.743
I'm honest, not stupid.

16:51.744 --> 16:54.246
No, no, Felix, you've got
to trick them with flattery.

16:54.247 --> 16:56.781
You know, like, "Baby, you
could do so much better than me.

16:56.782 --> 16:58.083
You're an African queen."

16:59.685 --> 17:03.021
Hey, what are you guys talking about?

17:03.022 --> 17:05.390
We're sharing with Felix how
we break up with somebody.

17:05.391 --> 17:08.359
Oh.

17:08.361 --> 17:11.329
Well, I probably shouldn't be the one...

17:11.329 --> 17:13.365
I really don't...

17:13.366 --> 17:15.066
Oh, what's that, table
five, more mustard?

17:15.067 --> 17:16.367
Coming right up.

17:16.368 --> 17:18.670
I just... I don't know
what to do. This is insane.

17:18.671 --> 17:19.704
What's wrong with me?

17:19.704 --> 17:21.138
There's nothing wrong with you.

17:21.140 --> 17:23.683
You were right... you're just
not a one-night stand kind of guy.

17:23.684 --> 17:24.906
Yes, I think we all know that,

17:24.907 --> 17:26.711
except for the squatter in my apartment.

17:26.712 --> 17:29.481
I get that... you're
looking for more than sex.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.505
You're looking for someone
to spend your life with.

17:31.506 --> 17:32.550
Right.

17:32.551 --> 17:33.885
Someone who drives you crazy

17:33.886 --> 17:35.387
and makes you do dumb things,

17:35.388 --> 17:38.757
but you can't picture
your life without her.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.692
Want to go talk to her?

17:40.693 --> 17:42.928
Yeah, I think so.

17:42.929 --> 17:45.696
I think you owe $12.25.

17:46.598 --> 17:48.566
And your portion of the onion rings.

17:48.567 --> 17:52.037
Dummy, we're having a moment here.

17:52.038 --> 17:54.571
Always has his moments
when the damn bill comes.

18:00.712 --> 18:03.981
Ah, the Real Housewives are on.

18:05.750 --> 18:06.785
Natasha?

18:06.786 --> 18:07.953
Felix.

18:07.954 --> 18:10.588
Park it right here.

18:10.589 --> 18:13.290
How about you give my feets a rub?

18:17.362 --> 18:20.165
You know, you may want to get
that little gray toe looked at.

18:20.166 --> 18:21.598
Oh.

18:22.767 --> 18:25.570
- Natasha...
- Oh.

18:25.571 --> 18:27.973
I am going to be
brutally honest with you.

18:27.974 --> 18:32.110
Um, as it turns out, I guess I
am just not the sort of person

18:32.111 --> 18:34.980
who is comfortable hopping
into bed with virtual strangers.

18:34.981 --> 18:36.648
Are you calling me a slut?

18:36.649 --> 18:42.220
No, no, no, no... no, you're great.

18:42.221 --> 18:46.057
What I meant to say was...

18:46.058 --> 18:48.292
Baby, you could do so
much better than me.

18:51.663 --> 18:53.630
You're a African queen.

18:57.235 --> 19:01.238
Oh, did you take one of
the pills from my purse?

19:02.273 --> 19:03.842
Okay, please leave.

19:03.843 --> 19:06.811
Get out, get out, get out,
be gone, you foul temptress!

19:06.812 --> 19:08.646
What is wrong with you?

19:08.647 --> 19:10.115
You're crazy!

19:10.116 --> 19:11.883
Dude, I was ready to leave

19:11.884 --> 19:16.021
two days ago, but you asked
me to stay for breakfast.

19:16.022 --> 19:17.989
You told me to take a bath

19:17.990 --> 19:20.558
and lay out on the balcony!

19:20.559 --> 19:23.261
I gave you a Jacksonville jiggler,

19:23.262 --> 19:27.598
which, you know, puts a lot
of strain on my lower back.

19:30.369 --> 19:33.872
I have never been so happy to leave

19:33.873 --> 19:35.939
and go back to my boyfriend.

19:41.012 --> 19:44.382
I did it.

19:44.383 --> 19:46.651
She's gone.

19:46.652 --> 19:48.051
Felix, you old heartbreaker.

19:55.332 --> 19:57.981
Oscar, what are you doing?

19:57.982 --> 19:59.482
I'm going to show you something

19:59.483 --> 20:01.218
that you're really going to like.

20:01.219 --> 20:05.087
You've said that before
with mixed results.

20:06.990 --> 20:09.226
It's your own shelf.

20:09.227 --> 20:13.396
For all your mysterious lady things.

20:13.397 --> 20:15.665
Okay, Oscar,

20:15.666 --> 20:17.601
what is going on?

20:17.602 --> 20:20.437
First you want to get
closer, and then you run away.

20:20.438 --> 20:24.507
Well, that's because you drive me crazy.

20:24.508 --> 20:25.342
I drive you crazy?

20:25.343 --> 20:26.977
Yeah.

20:26.978 --> 20:30.213
Because I realized

20:30.214 --> 20:31.947
that I love you, Charlotte.

20:33.683 --> 20:36.686
And that's why I do
all these stupid things,

20:36.687 --> 20:39.823
because...
