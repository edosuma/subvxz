I criticize you for living

41:09.625 --> 41:11.125
in a fantasy world, Dawson,

41:11.125 --> 41:12.542
but the truth is-- is...

41:14.417 --> 41:15.792
I envy you. I...

41:16.750 --> 41:20.458
Everything is so new,
so untouched for you.

41:20.458 --> 41:23.083
I-- I would gladly trade in
all my experience

41:23.083 --> 41:26.166
for just an ounce
of your idealism.

41:26.917 --> 41:29.000
And I wish I knew some
better way to say this--

41:29.000 --> 41:31.083
W-w-we can make this work.
We can fix this.

41:31.083 --> 41:32.458
-No, no, no.
-I know we can, Jen!

41:32.458 --> 41:34.083
No, it's over. It's over.

41:34.083 --> 41:35.333
Jen, you're upset, you know?

41:35.333 --> 41:36.875
Sleep on this. We'll talk
in the morning.

41:36.875 --> 41:38.250
We don't need to go
over all this now--

41:38.250 --> 41:40.166
Dawson, please, listen to me.
Listen to me.

41:40.417 --> 41:42.000
I gotta take a few steps back.

41:42.000 --> 41:45.875
I've-- I've-- I've-- got to try
life on my own for a while.

41:45.875 --> 41:48.458
You-- you can't just make me
fall for you and then...

41:50.208 --> 41:51.750
bail as soon as it-- I...

[SIGHS]

41:54.333 --> 41:55.417
[COUGHS]

41:56.834 --> 41:58.125
I'll miss you, you know.

41:59.834 --> 42:00.667
Yeah.

42:01.500 --> 42:03.458
I'll be sleeping 80 feet
away from you,

42:03.458 --> 42:05.208
and it'll feel
like a thousand miles.

42:07.625 --> 42:08.417
[SIGHS]

42:08.417 --> 42:10.041
I'll regret my decision
constantly.

42:10.041 --> 42:13.375
I'll kick myself
to no end, and...

42:16.000 --> 42:17.750
and when I come crawling
back to you...

42:17.750 --> 42:19.458
You'll have every
right to say uh,

42:19.959 --> 42:22.041
"Take a hike, Jen.
I'm with somebody else now,

42:22.041 --> 42:23.917
-and I don't need--"
-Somebody who appreciates me.

42:24.291 --> 42:26.542
Somebody who doesn't blow into
town with her dysfunctional past

42:26.542 --> 42:28.333
to play mind games
with the boy next door.

42:28.333 --> 42:31.458
Somebody who is capable of a
healthy, committed relationship,

42:31.458 --> 42:32.667
and unfortunately,

42:33.250 --> 42:34.792
somebody nothing like you.
