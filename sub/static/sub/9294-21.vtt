00:12.680 --> 00:15.949
Have you secured the canister?
I'm afraid not, ma'am.

00:16.068 --> 00:17.754
Our suspect escaped
beyond the perimeter.

00:17.874 --> 00:19.789
I was told
that the area was locked down.

00:19.909 --> 00:21.533
What happened?
He had help

00:21.600 --> 00:23.167
from Tony Almeida.

00:23.235 --> 00:24.313
<i>Almeida?</i>

00:24.433 --> 00:25.522
<i>He was working for us.</i>

00:25.642 --> 00:26.738
It only appeared that way.

00:26.806 --> 00:28.382
Apparently he was pursuing
his own agenda,

00:28.502 --> 00:30.174
trying to get his hands
on the canister.

00:30.242 --> 00:31.777
We're all regrouping
to develop leads.

00:31.897 --> 00:33.044
I may have one.

00:33.111 --> 00:35.012
As Hodges was taken
into custody,

00:35.080 --> 00:37.172
he yelled at me
about some larger group

00:37.292 --> 00:39.283
that would continue on
after his arrest.

00:39.351 --> 00:40.403
If that's the case,
Madam President,

00:40.523 --> 00:41.472
we need to talk to him.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.822
I need you
to call the attorney general

00:43.889 --> 00:46.825
and draft a witness protection
agreement for Jonas Hodges.

00:46.892 --> 00:48.526
There's no other way
he'll talk.

00:48.594 --> 00:51.256
<i>This man murdered your son,
not to mention</i>

00:51.376 --> 00:53.230
hundreds of innocent civilians.

00:53.298 --> 00:56.720
Is there anything else
that I can do for you?

00:56.840 --> 00:59.170
Other than kill
Jonas Hodges, no.

01:00.454 --> 01:01.473
I didn't mean that.

01:01.540 --> 01:02.774
You know, you're right.

01:02.842 --> 01:04.742
We shouldn't be talking
about this over the phone.

01:04.810 --> 01:06.077
How soon can you be
at the White House?

01:06.144 --> 01:08.412
How's 15 minutes sound?
Good.

01:08.481 --> 01:11.029
The plan was to launch
simultaneous attacks

01:11.149 --> 01:13.184
early next year
in multiple cities,

01:13.251 --> 01:14.565
so the public
would finally see

01:14.685 --> 01:16.187
that the government
can't protect them.

01:16.254 --> 01:18.656
They'd demand drastic measures,
and we'd step in.

01:18.724 --> 01:21.163
<i>We were going to supply the
enemies that want to destroy</i>

01:21.283 --> 01:22.307
this country-- Muhammad this,

01:22.427 --> 01:23.327
Achmed that.

01:23.395 --> 01:24.462
Mr. Hodges, I need the names

01:24.530 --> 01:26.230
of the people
that you are working with.

01:26.298 --> 01:28.065
I don't have any...
I want the names!

01:28.133 --> 01:29.367
I don't know any!

01:29.434 --> 01:30.935
Another attack
today is all we need

01:31.003 --> 01:32.837
to push this thing
right over the edge.

01:32.905 --> 01:35.239
This is no time to pull back.

01:35.307 --> 01:36.608
<i>I say we take that canister</i>

01:36.675 --> 01:40.044
and finish the job off today.
I'll contact the group.

01:40.112 --> 01:42.346
The attack will be attributed
to this man--

01:42.414 --> 01:44.215
Jibraan Al-Zarian.

01:44.282 --> 01:45.950
We're talking
about launching a new operation

01:46.018 --> 01:47.451
in the next few hours

01:47.520 --> 01:49.353
and with only one canister.

01:49.421 --> 01:51.550
The plan for this operation
was already in place.

01:51.670 --> 01:53.558
We'd just be accelerating
the timetable.

01:53.626 --> 01:55.059
Jonas Hodges was a loose cannon,

01:55.127 --> 01:56.794
and the group is
well rid of him,

01:56.862 --> 01:59.196
but, in his lunacy,
he did us a favor.

01:59.264 --> 02:00.297
I say we take it.

02:00.365 --> 02:02.400
Hamid!

02:02.467 --> 02:04.068
Keep your mouth shut
and no one gets hurt.

02:04.136 --> 02:05.584
You understand?!
Yes!

02:39.414 --> 02:40.974
How much more time
do you need?

02:41.793 --> 02:43.741
The material's
almost finished downloading.

02:43.809 --> 02:46.002
Financial records are in place.

02:46.772 --> 02:47.887
I'm gonna need

02:48.007 --> 02:50.147
about another 15 minutes
to alter the time stamps.

02:51.366 --> 02:52.757
Good.

03:06.205 --> 03:07.739
I'm gonna take this off.

03:08.300 --> 03:10.568
You yell for help,
you and your brother die.

03:10.636 --> 03:11.636
Understand?

03:22.286 --> 03:24.158
Who are
you people?

03:25.848 --> 03:29.098
You're putting Jihadi
propaganda on my computer.

03:29.655 --> 03:30.957
These weapons--
you're...

03:32.530 --> 03:34.113
you're trying to make me
look like a terrorist.

03:34.233 --> 03:35.392
Why are you
doing this?

03:36.937 --> 03:38.867
Listen to me, Jibraan.

03:39.865 --> 03:42.156
There's only one thing
you need to know.

03:43.573 --> 03:46.370
If you don't do
exactly as I say,

03:47.248 --> 03:48.727
you're going to watch
your younger brother die

03:48.847 --> 03:50.303
right in front
of your eyes.

03:52.210 --> 03:55.813
And then...
I'm gonna kill you.

03:55.881 --> 03:57.481
Hmm?

03:57.549 --> 04:01.173
However...
if you cooperate...

04:02.928 --> 04:03.926
...there's a good chance

04:04.046 --> 04:05.289
the two of you will live
through this.

04:07.970 --> 04:10.194
What do you want me to do?

04:10.262 --> 04:12.030
First off...

04:12.097 --> 04:13.531
you're going to
read this statement

04:13.598 --> 04:15.166
in front of
a camera,

04:15.233 --> 04:17.442
and you're going to read it
like you mean it.

04:18.286 --> 04:19.324
No, this is insane.

04:19.444 --> 04:20.260
I can't read this.

04:20.380 --> 04:21.459
I'm not going to do this.

04:21.579 --> 04:23.007
Okay, see,
that sounds to me

04:23.075 --> 04:24.914
like you think
you have a choice.

04:25.034 --> 04:26.162
Please, this is not right.

04:26.282 --> 04:27.566
You can't do this to us.

04:27.686 --> 04:29.113
Okay, fine.

04:29.181 --> 04:31.285
Okay, okay, please,
please don't hurt him.

04:35.341 --> 04:36.654
I'll do whatever you say.

04:37.690 --> 04:39.385
Okay?

04:52.838 --> 04:54.839
I'll give you five minutes
to look that over.

05:05.718 --> 05:08.100
I just finished the first
sweep with the CTU servers.

05:08.220 --> 05:09.647
There's been no chatter,
no activity at all.

05:09.767 --> 05:10.934
You updated the watch list?

05:11.054 --> 05:13.001
Yes, everyone on that list
is already under surveillance

05:13.121 --> 05:13.958
by law enforcement.

05:14.026 --> 05:15.259
If one of them was
gonna do something,

05:15.327 --> 05:16.594
we would know about it.

05:16.661 --> 05:18.162
Damn, well, we're going to have
to widen our parameter.

05:18.230 --> 05:19.430
To include what?

05:21.670 --> 05:23.110
I want you to check out
every Muslim

05:23.230 --> 05:24.527
in the Washington D.C. area.

05:24.972 --> 05:25.723
Target anyone

05:25.843 --> 05:27.400
who's working in a sensitive
government position

05:27.520 --> 05:28.648
or in a place
that might get hit.

05:28.768 --> 05:30.377
Then I want you
to start pulling the files

05:30.497 --> 05:31.664
on every political activist

05:31.784 --> 05:33.377
working in the
Muslim community.

05:33.445 --> 05:35.369
Also, I want you
to contact INS.

05:35.489 --> 05:36.773
I want a list
of every recent immigrant

05:36.893 --> 05:37.749
from an Islamic country.

05:37.816 --> 05:39.453
Excuse me, has anybody heard
of racial profiling?

05:39.573 --> 05:40.857
Janis, not now.

05:43.744 --> 05:44.878
No, she's right.

05:49.391 --> 05:50.995
You're right,
this is racial profiling,

05:51.063 --> 05:52.997
and I don't like it
any more than you do,

05:53.065 --> 05:54.298
but Hodges told me specifically

05:54.366 --> 05:56.134
that he was going to
utilize Muslim extremists

05:56.201 --> 05:57.168
in an effort
to offload

05:57.236 --> 05:58.803
the blame
for this attack.

05:58.871 --> 06:00.037
I need to know
who he's working with,

06:00.105 --> 06:01.272
and we're running out of time.

06:01.339 --> 06:03.492
I don't know a better way
of doing this.

06:04.309 --> 06:06.488
So if you do,
please tell me now.

06:07.813 --> 06:08.558
No.

06:10.887 --> 06:12.583
Okay, thank you.

06:16.222 --> 06:19.623
Chloe, I need you
to run down the list of...

06:20.860 --> 06:21.994
uh...

06:25.831 --> 06:26.543
I-I'm sorry,

06:26.663 --> 06:27.665
I forgot
what I was saying.

06:27.732 --> 06:29.210
INS records, Jack?

06:29.912 --> 06:32.503
Yeah, run those down first
and then work backwards.

06:32.570 --> 06:34.114
Excuse me.

06:36.574 --> 06:38.256
This is the second time
he's done this.

06:38.376 --> 06:40.154
He keeps forgetting things,
he looks like hell.

06:40.612 --> 06:42.312
He's doing pretty
well, considering.

06:42.639 --> 06:43.289
Considering?

06:43.409 --> 06:44.348
Considering what?

06:45.031 --> 06:46.184
He didn't tell you?

06:46.251 --> 06:47.646
Tell me what?

06:48.697 --> 06:49.804
If there's something wrong
with Jack,

06:49.924 --> 06:50.922
tell me now.

06:50.989 --> 06:52.289
He's sick, Chloe.

06:52.409 --> 06:54.142
He was infected
with the prion variant.

06:55.681 --> 06:56.694
How?

06:56.761 --> 06:58.556
He was trying to recover
the bioweapon canisters

06:58.676 --> 06:59.409
and one of them ruptured.

06:59.529 --> 07:00.764
He was exposed.

07:00.833 --> 07:01.999
Oh, my God.

07:02.067 --> 07:03.537
I'm sorry, Chloe,
he probably didn't want you

07:03.657 --> 07:05.092
to worry.
Chloe...

07:23.053 --> 07:24.621
Why didn't you tell me
you were sick?

07:25.528 --> 07:26.523
It doesn't matter.

07:27.598 --> 07:28.508
It doesn't matter?

07:28.628 --> 07:29.360
I'm your friend.

07:29.427 --> 07:31.595
We need to stay focused
on finding Tony.

07:31.663 --> 07:33.231
Jack, you should be
in the hospital.

07:37.936 --> 07:39.829
There's no treatment for this.

07:41.066 --> 07:42.639
There's no cure.

07:45.736 --> 07:47.411
So you're telling me
you're dying?

07:49.325 --> 07:50.614
Yes.

07:53.277 --> 07:54.418
How long?

07:55.367 --> 07:58.256
A day, maybe two.

08:12.715 --> 08:14.372
I've been taking this
anti-seizure medicine

08:14.439 --> 08:16.204
to keep me
on my feet.

08:16.875 --> 08:18.682
It's been working so far.

08:21.952 --> 08:23.861
Oh, my God.

08:24.449 --> 08:25.849
I'm so sorry.

08:27.886 --> 08:29.996
Chloe, it's all right.

08:31.390 --> 08:35.025
I've accepted it...
and I need you

08:35.092 --> 08:37.260
to accept
it, too.

08:40.365 --> 08:43.100
Whatever time I've got
left, I want it to matter.

08:45.103 --> 08:49.840
We need to find Tony,
put an end to this.

08:53.878 --> 08:54.878
Chloe.

08:57.782 --> 09:00.952
I can't do this
without you.

09:01.683 --> 09:04.060
Please, I need you
to go back to work.

09:12.632 --> 09:14.460
Okay.

09:25.043 --> 09:27.382
We strike this blow for
our brothers and sisters

09:27.502 --> 09:30.914
who have died at the hands
of this corrupt nation.

09:30.983 --> 09:32.116
The hour is here,

09:32.184 --> 09:34.718
and we are ready
for the war that is to come.

09:35.952 --> 09:39.423
Our fighters will not rest
until America lies crippled

09:39.491 --> 09:41.625
and dying,

09:41.693 --> 09:43.060
her streets running
with blood,

09:43.128 --> 09:44.195
and her people
begging

09:44.262 --> 09:46.930
for mercy,
but there will be none...

09:48.619 --> 09:49.700
only our vengeance.

09:49.767 --> 09:51.135
We have a problem.

09:51.203 --> 09:52.136
What is it?

09:52.204 --> 09:53.434
Police.

09:59.844 --> 10:00.944
Why don't you, uh...

10:01.013 --> 10:03.306
close down the computer
and get out of sight.

10:05.984 --> 10:08.085
Take everything down
and watch the brother.

10:10.155 --> 10:12.089
You need
to come with me.

10:12.157 --> 10:13.224
What is happening?

10:13.291 --> 10:15.559
There are
two police officers outside.

10:15.627 --> 10:17.895
I want you to find out
what they want

10:17.962 --> 10:20.031
and convince them that
everything's okay in here.

10:21.099 --> 10:25.469
Jibraan...
don't try to warn them.

10:25.537 --> 10:27.738
Right.

10:33.412 --> 10:34.345
DCPD.

10:34.413 --> 10:35.623
Open the door,
please.

10:42.626 --> 10:43.987
Yes?

10:44.056 --> 10:45.456
"Jibrain" Al-Zarian?

10:45.524 --> 10:47.124
<i>Jibraan Al-Zarian.</i>

10:47.192 --> 10:49.193
Uh, we got a call from
one of your neighbors.

10:49.261 --> 10:50.343
They said they
heard some yelling

10:50.501 --> 10:51.762
coming from your apartment,

10:51.829 --> 10:53.997
saw some people they didn't
recognize enter the premises,

10:54.066 --> 10:56.401
thought there might
be some trouble.

10:58.203 --> 10:59.752
No, everything is fine.

10:59.872 --> 11:01.905
Those were
friends of mine.

11:01.973 --> 11:03.395
And what about the yelling?

11:04.643 --> 11:06.395
We got into an argument.

11:06.515 --> 11:08.371
They were drinking
a little too much.

11:08.491 --> 11:09.817
Uh, it was nothing.

11:10.285 --> 11:11.780
Where are your
friends now, sir?

11:14.042 --> 11:15.219
Um...

11:15.287 --> 11:17.695
you know, they got too loud,
so I asked them to leave.

11:18.423 --> 11:19.541
They won't be back.

11:20.880 --> 11:23.227
I'm very sorry for the noise.

11:23.295 --> 11:25.583
Uh... it won't happen again.

11:25.703 --> 11:27.030
I-I promise.

11:27.099 --> 11:28.199
Okay.

11:28.266 --> 11:30.201
Just keep it
down from now on.

11:30.268 --> 11:32.169
I will.
Have a good night.

11:32.237 --> 11:33.590
You, too.

11:51.894 --> 11:53.290
All right, we're clear.

11:55.859 --> 11:57.027
You did good, Jibraan.

11:57.679 --> 11:59.263
We have to finish
reading this statement

11:59.331 --> 12:00.498
before we
take off.

12:00.565 --> 12:01.698
Where are we going?

12:02.820 --> 12:04.735
Don't worry about that.

12:04.802 --> 12:06.837
You just keep
doing as we say,

12:06.904 --> 12:07.883
and you and your brother

12:08.003 --> 12:10.274
are gonna make it
through this, all right?

12:10.342 --> 12:12.121
Set him up.

12:24.942 --> 12:28.759
And there will be none,
only our vengeance.

12:28.826 --> 12:31.061
And this is only
the beginning.

12:31.129 --> 12:34.532
We will strike again
and again in the name

12:34.599 --> 12:37.201
of all that is great
and righteous.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.134
I think I've got something.

12:54.202 --> 12:56.203
Agent Walker?
What is it?

12:56.270 --> 12:57.980
One of the filters flagged this
a few minutes ago.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.333
I just finished vetting it.

12:59.401 --> 13:00.501
These are multiple deposits

13:00.569 --> 13:02.203
over a period
of six months.

13:02.271 --> 13:04.338
They're from an overseas
Muslim relief organization

13:04.406 --> 13:06.340
called the Islamic League
for World Peace.

13:06.408 --> 13:08.542
A total of two million dollars

13:08.610 --> 13:09.978
to the Washington
Continental Bank.

13:10.045 --> 13:11.545
Every penny of it was withdrawn

13:11.613 --> 13:13.044
within 30 minutes.
What name's

13:13.164 --> 13:14.292
on the account?

13:15.872 --> 13:17.485
Jibraan Al-Zarian.

13:17.552 --> 13:20.454
He's 27 years old, moved here
from Pakistan on a student visa

13:20.522 --> 13:21.622
four years ago.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.491
This is his
personal web account.

13:25.180 --> 13:26.995
These are some of the
sites he's been looking at

13:27.062 --> 13:29.063
recently.
We got an address on him?

13:29.368 --> 13:31.016
No. This address is false.

13:31.136 --> 13:31.900
It doesn't exist.

13:32.020 --> 13:33.534
Yeah, his visa expired.
He's here illegally,

13:33.602 --> 13:34.811
and he probably doesn't
want to be found.

13:34.931 --> 13:36.171
He does have
a personal reference

13:36.238 --> 13:37.738
on his
INS form.
Who?

13:37.807 --> 13:39.073
Muhtadi Gohar.

13:39.141 --> 13:41.042
He lives at the G Street Mosque
in Georgetown.

13:41.110 --> 13:42.210
He's the imam there.

13:42.278 --> 13:43.978
He might be able
to help us find Al-Zarian.

13:44.046 --> 13:46.014
We need to talk to him.
Put out an APB

13:46.134 --> 13:47.859
on Al-Zarian, run it through
the interagency database.

13:47.979 --> 13:49.406
See what else you can find.

13:49.679 --> 13:51.019
Fax everything over to the car.

13:51.086 --> 13:51.928
Great work.

13:54.256 --> 13:55.456
Jack, wait.

13:55.524 --> 13:57.758
Are you sure
you're up for this?

13:59.295 --> 14:01.229
I have to see this through.

14:02.130 --> 14:03.261
Please.

14:04.444 --> 14:05.770
I can help.

14:07.236 --> 14:09.403
Okay. Let's go.

14:13.490 --> 14:14.397
Come in.

14:15.410 --> 14:17.140
Ma'am, Mr. Collier
to see you.

14:17.260 --> 14:18.947
Thank you,
Agent Pierce.

14:19.014 --> 14:20.281
That'll be all.

14:24.486 --> 14:26.174
I appreciate
you coming, Martin.

14:26.294 --> 14:27.422
It's been a
long time.

14:27.542 --> 14:28.890
You look good.

14:28.958 --> 14:29.892
Thanks.

14:30.672 --> 14:33.661
So, Olivia, I know
why you asked me here,

14:33.729 --> 14:36.630
but I have to tell you,
having me dig up dirt

14:36.698 --> 14:38.299
on Noah Daniels is one thing.

14:38.367 --> 14:40.869
This is a whole
different animal.

14:40.936 --> 14:42.136
I'm aware of that, Martin.

14:42.204 --> 14:43.404
I want this to happen.

14:43.472 --> 14:44.572
I want this person

14:44.639 --> 14:46.474
taken care of.
Mm-hmm.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.143
It's Jonas Hodges.

14:49.211 --> 14:50.094
Starkwood?

14:50.214 --> 14:51.108
Yes.

14:51.780 --> 14:54.082
What in God's name
do you have against him?

14:54.149 --> 14:56.477
I don't know how much
of this will get out,

14:56.597 --> 14:57.829
but Hodges was behind everything

14:57.949 --> 14:59.878
that happened today,
from the planes going down

14:59.998 --> 15:01.360
to the attack
on the White House.

15:01.480 --> 15:03.102
What?
It's true.

15:03.993 --> 15:06.517
He's also responsible
for the death of my brother.

15:07.726 --> 15:09.297
I thought
your brother killed himself.

15:10.456 --> 15:11.561
He was murdered,

15:12.185 --> 15:13.768
and Hodges was responsible.

15:13.835 --> 15:15.279
Okay. But why?

15:16.072 --> 15:17.242
It's complicated, Martin,

15:17.362 --> 15:19.101
and I don't have time
to go into it.

15:19.221 --> 15:21.642
All you need to know is,
Hodges worked a deal.

15:21.710 --> 15:22.810
Witness Protection.

15:22.878 --> 15:23.737
My mother approved it,

15:23.857 --> 15:25.427
and he's going free...

15:25.547 --> 15:26.623
unless someone intervenes.

15:26.743 --> 15:28.638
Okay, can I give you
a little advice?

15:29.184 --> 15:29.925
What?

15:30.045 --> 15:31.519
This is big game. Walk away.

15:32.629 --> 15:33.718
I can't do that.

15:33.838 --> 15:34.878
Once this happens,

15:34.998 --> 15:36.958
once it goes through,
you can never go back.

15:37.026 --> 15:38.960
You will live with it
for the rest of your life.

15:39.028 --> 15:41.129
I don't need a lecture
on conscience from you,

15:41.196 --> 15:42.376
of all people.

15:44.014 --> 15:45.566
Oh.

15:49.474 --> 15:51.567
<i>I have thought this through.</i>

15:53.742 --> 15:55.176
What I can't live with

15:55.244 --> 15:57.778
is that monster
getting away with this.

15:57.846 --> 16:00.217
He has to pay
for what he did.

16:08.190 --> 16:10.191
So, uh, where's Hodges now?

16:10.259 --> 16:12.994
In FBI custody, downtown bureau.

16:13.062 --> 16:14.996
Deal has been signed.

16:15.064 --> 16:16.730
He's being released
into witness protection

16:16.798 --> 16:18.132
within the hour.

16:18.200 --> 16:20.335
Here's his itinerary.

16:22.608 --> 16:25.205
When he walks out that door,
we lose him.

16:25.325 --> 16:26.703
He disappears forever.

16:26.823 --> 16:27.452
This has got

16:27.572 --> 16:29.083
to happen fast.

16:30.848 --> 16:32.181
Martin.

16:38.587 --> 16:40.154
All right.

16:40.222 --> 16:41.589
I'll make a call.

16:41.656 --> 16:44.725
I'll get you contact
information, a price,

16:44.793 --> 16:47.495
and instructions
on how to transfer the funds.

16:47.562 --> 16:49.650
Thank you.

16:51.100 --> 16:53.234
You'll hear from me soon.

17:18.071 --> 17:19.593
Mr. Hodges,

17:19.661 --> 17:22.262
this is U.S.
Marshal Sullivan.

17:22.330 --> 17:23.864
I'm placing you
in his custody.

17:23.932 --> 17:26.967
He'll take you
to witness protection.

17:29.771 --> 17:32.173
Thank you for your hospitality,
young lady.

17:35.823 --> 17:38.112
This dossier outlines
your new identity,

17:38.180 --> 17:39.647
your new place
of residence,

17:39.714 --> 17:41.749
all the information
you're going to need

17:41.816 --> 17:43.117
to make this transition.

17:45.898 --> 17:49.123
Robert Tippett?
That's my new name?

17:49.191 --> 17:50.925
Yes, sir.

17:53.056 --> 17:55.526
Sounds like a dog breed.

17:57.931 --> 18:00.734
Our first stop is the WITT-SEC
facility in Colorado.

18:00.802 --> 18:03.371
We'll put the finishing touches
on your new biography,

18:03.439 --> 18:05.117
fabricate your new ID,

18:05.637 --> 18:07.308
get you into counseling.

18:07.376 --> 18:09.000
Counseling?

18:10.079 --> 18:13.581
It helps entrants deal
with their new circumstances.

18:13.648 --> 18:15.149
Son, you know who I am.

18:15.217 --> 18:17.518
Do I impress you as someone
who needs therapy

18:17.586 --> 18:19.120
to cope with new circumstances?

18:19.188 --> 18:22.323
The service is available
if you want it, sir,

18:22.391 --> 18:24.358
courtesy of the
American taxpayer.

18:25.450 --> 18:27.465
You think I'm getting off easy,
don't you?

18:28.115 --> 18:30.198
I don't think anything.

18:32.468 --> 18:34.502
I can smell attitude, son,

18:35.234 --> 18:37.948
and you're giving it off
pretty thick.

18:38.574 --> 18:40.345
I've lost everything--

18:41.288 --> 18:43.311
my company, my family,

18:43.378 --> 18:46.247
and most importantly, my name.

18:46.315 --> 18:48.649
Do you know
how much blood and sweat went

18:48.717 --> 18:50.684
into making that name
mean something?

18:53.296 --> 18:56.449
We leave for Andrews
Air Force Base in 30 minutes.

18:56.569 --> 18:59.327
I suggest you get ready.

19:32.120 --> 19:33.288
Jack?

19:34.523 --> 19:35.725
I'm fine.

19:38.550 --> 19:39.324
What are you doing?

19:39.444 --> 19:39.873
We don't even know

19:39.993 --> 19:40.810
that they've done anything yet.

19:40.930 --> 19:41.620
They could be innocent.

19:41.740 --> 19:43.094
Innocent? You heard Hodges.

19:43.214 --> 19:44.632
They're gonna use sleeper cells
to carry out

19:44.700 --> 19:45.800
these attacks.

19:45.867 --> 19:47.669
Al-Zarian might not have been
knowingly complicit

19:47.736 --> 19:49.103
about everything
that happened today,

19:49.171 --> 19:51.138
but innocent? No.

19:55.466 --> 19:56.611
Yes?

19:56.679 --> 19:59.347
This is Agent Walker with FBI.

19:59.415 --> 20:00.682
Mr. Gohar?

20:01.298 --> 20:01.982
Yes.

20:02.050 --> 20:03.951
We're sorry to bother you
at such a late hour,

20:04.019 --> 20:05.587
but we need your help.

20:05.654 --> 20:06.954
My help?

20:07.022 --> 20:08.989
To stop a potential
terrorist attack.

20:14.507 --> 20:15.996
Mr. Gohar?

20:17.575 --> 20:18.933
I know you.

20:20.293 --> 20:22.169
My name is Jack Bauer.

20:23.309 --> 20:24.472
Of course.

20:25.155 --> 20:27.583
I watched your testimony
on television.

20:27.703 --> 20:28.676
Sir,

20:28.744 --> 20:30.345
can we talk to you inside?

20:30.927 --> 20:32.413
Please.

20:59.202 --> 21:00.408
What do you want?

21:00.476 --> 21:02.397
We're looking
for a man who worships here.

21:02.517 --> 21:03.346
We believe he may be

21:03.466 --> 21:04.812
helping to plan
another attack

21:04.880 --> 21:06.581
that may be happening
soon, in D.C.

21:07.489 --> 21:09.317
I knew the blame
would eventually

21:09.385 --> 21:10.518
fall on us.

21:10.586 --> 21:12.192
His name is
Jibraan Al-Zarian.

21:12.312 --> 21:13.430
Do you know him?

21:14.184 --> 21:15.991
And why do you think
he's a terrorist?

21:16.368 --> 21:18.393
He fits a specific
profile.

21:18.513 --> 21:19.940
You mean,
he is a Muslim.

21:20.060 --> 21:21.448
He's a Pakistani national.

21:21.568 --> 21:22.943
His VISA lapsed
a yearargo.

21:23.063 --> 21:24.465
And he has no
legal address.

21:24.533 --> 21:27.093
He listed you as a personal
reference on his INS form.

21:27.213 --> 21:29.103
Where someone worships
is private information,

21:29.171 --> 21:30.171
protected by law.

21:30.238 --> 21:31.372
Right now,
finding Al-Zarian

21:31.440 --> 21:32.202
is the only way
we're going

21:32.322 --> 21:33.841
to prevent an attack
against civilians.

21:33.909 --> 21:36.377
So, I ask you again, sir,
do you know him?

21:39.398 --> 21:41.449
Look at the photo!

21:46.755 --> 21:48.456
Yes, I know him.

21:48.524 --> 21:50.061
But he is not a terrorist!

21:50.181 --> 21:52.126
What makes you so sure?

21:52.194 --> 21:53.461
Jibraan has come to me

21:53.529 --> 21:55.530
many times for spiritual advice.

21:55.597 --> 21:57.097
I know the man.

21:57.165 --> 21:59.934
He is not violent and
he is not an extremist.

22:00.054 --> 22:02.269
We have evidence that
indicates otherwise.

22:02.338 --> 22:03.705
I would like to see
this evidence.

22:03.772 --> 22:04.688
Listen to me.

22:04.808 --> 22:06.474
We did not come here
to debate this with you.

22:06.542 --> 22:07.809
Where does he live?

22:07.876 --> 22:08.930
I don't know where he lives.

22:09.050 --> 22:10.457
Where does he work?
I don't know that, either.

22:10.577 --> 22:11.674
And I don't believe you!

22:11.794 --> 22:13.748
But you expect me
to believe you?

22:14.404 --> 22:16.202
I watched your hearing
at the Senate,

22:16.322 --> 22:17.418
I know what you have done.

22:17.486 --> 22:19.253
So, tell me why should
I believe anything

22:19.321 --> 22:20.225
you say to me?

22:20.345 --> 22:21.956
First because you
don't have a choice.

22:22.023 --> 22:24.379
Second, because I am
telling you the truth!

22:24.499 --> 22:26.661
The truth is that you come
into a house of worship

22:26.729 --> 22:28.663
with information
you should not have,

22:28.731 --> 22:32.600
an outrageous accusation, no
legal warrant, and threaten me.

22:32.668 --> 22:34.802
I have not threatened you.

22:34.870 --> 22:36.070
Not yet.

22:36.137 --> 22:38.138
But we both know
where this is going.

22:38.258 --> 22:39.865
If you're so sure
he's innocent,

22:39.985 --> 22:41.197
why are you afraid to tell us

22:41.317 --> 22:42.042
where he is?
Jack...

22:42.110 --> 22:43.043
Where is he?!

22:43.111 --> 22:44.912
I told you, I don't know.

22:46.046 --> 22:47.014
But even if I did,

22:47.082 --> 22:49.183
I would say nothing.

22:49.251 --> 22:52.231
I would not help you
arrest an innocent man.

22:54.690 --> 22:56.123
This is Agent Walker.

22:56.191 --> 22:57.358
It's Janis.

22:57.426 --> 23:00.210
A DCPD officer recognized
Jibraan Al-Zarian

23:00.330 --> 23:01.315
from a domestic
disturbance call

23:01.435 --> 23:02.897
he took 15 minutes ago.

23:02.964 --> 23:04.799
The address is 2700 Eastbrook,

23:04.867 --> 23:06.200
Apartment 3.

23:06.268 --> 23:07.835
All right, good.
Coordinate with DCPD.

23:07.936 --> 23:09.470
Set up an envelope and put
the building under surveillance

23:09.538 --> 23:10.738
We'll be there
in 10 minutes.

23:10.806 --> 23:11.964
We have an address on Al-Zarian.

23:12.084 --> 23:13.641
Let's go, Jack.
Turn around.

23:13.709 --> 23:15.209
Why?
I said turn around.

23:15.277 --> 23:17.378
Put your hands up, now!
Jack?

23:17.446 --> 23:18.546
What are you doing, Jack?

23:18.614 --> 23:19.914
I'm not letting him
call Al-Zarian

23:19.981 --> 23:21.348
before we get there.

23:21.417 --> 23:22.850
He's coming with us.
You have no right!

23:22.918 --> 23:25.502
I have done nothing wrong!
Shut up!

23:27.556 --> 23:32.092
...there will be none,
only our vengeance.

23:32.814 --> 23:35.300
And this is only the beginning.

23:36.357 --> 23:38.198
We will strike again and again

23:38.266 --> 23:41.257
in the name of all
that is great and righteous.

23:41.377 --> 23:42.889
All right, fine.

23:44.676 --> 23:45.840
The staging team's ready

23:45.908 --> 23:46.908
and waiting on us.

23:46.975 --> 23:48.409
This'll be uploaded
in two minutes.

23:49.445 --> 23:50.807
Good.

23:55.116 --> 23:57.095
Jibraan...

23:58.153 --> 23:59.887
we're getting ready to move out.

24:01.423 --> 24:03.190
I'm gonna need you
to talk to your brother.

24:03.258 --> 24:05.274
Tell him what we discussed.

24:05.994 --> 24:08.429
Go ahead and wake him up.

24:09.465 --> 24:11.065
Please, I can't do this.

24:13.401 --> 24:14.869
Yes, you can.

24:14.937 --> 24:16.270
And you will.

24:16.338 --> 24:19.106
How do I know you
won't kill Hamid anyway?

24:19.174 --> 24:21.943
Because we need him
to tell the police

24:22.010 --> 24:23.478
that his brother's a terrorist.

24:24.513 --> 24:26.280
Believe me,

24:26.348 --> 24:29.249
you're saving his
life by doing this.

24:29.317 --> 24:30.785
Now, come on, let's go.

24:36.825 --> 24:37.792
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

24:37.860 --> 24:40.060
Hamid, Hamid, calm down.

24:40.128 --> 24:41.596
Don't be scared.

24:41.663 --> 24:43.330
Jibraan, what is this?

24:43.885 --> 24:45.602
Sorry we had to do it this way.

24:45.722 --> 24:47.347
But you're not going to
be hurt anymore, okay?

24:47.467 --> 24:48.836
We? Who is we?

24:48.904 --> 24:49.849
What's happening?

24:49.969 --> 24:51.271
I'll explain
everything to you, okay?

24:51.339 --> 24:52.473
Who's he?

24:55.237 --> 24:57.578
Um, he's a friend.

24:57.646 --> 24:58.913
Your friend?
I know all your friends.

24:58.981 --> 25:00.114
I've never seen him before.

25:00.181 --> 25:02.082
That's because I have
kept him from you.

25:02.150 --> 25:04.151
What are you talking about?

25:04.219 --> 25:07.087
I have to tell you something.

25:07.155 --> 25:10.290
I'm not the person
you think I am.

25:10.358 --> 25:12.092
What?

25:12.160 --> 25:15.863
I hate what this country
has done to our people.

25:15.931 --> 25:17.832
And I'm working with these men.

25:18.484 --> 25:20.467
They're going to
help me strike back

25:20.536 --> 25:22.436
against the evil
that has been done to us.

25:22.504 --> 25:23.905
Strike back?

25:23.972 --> 25:26.541
I can't say any more than that.

25:28.644 --> 25:30.511
I don't believe it.

25:30.579 --> 25:32.880
This country brought us in,
gave us a home,

25:32.948 --> 25:34.248
that's what you always said.

25:34.315 --> 25:36.584
Yeah, that was a lie.

25:36.652 --> 25:37.852
I have been protecting you

25:37.920 --> 25:40.521
from this rage I've
always felt inside.

25:40.589 --> 25:43.357
But now it is time
for you to know the truth.

25:43.425 --> 25:45.660
It was the Americans who
killed our parents, Hamid.

25:45.727 --> 25:48.495
I'm going to make them pay.

25:48.564 --> 25:50.064
What have you done
to my brother?

25:50.131 --> 25:51.866
You've poisoned his mind!
This isn't my brother!

25:51.934 --> 25:53.133
They have not done
anything to me, okay.

25:53.201 --> 25:54.334
It is very important you accept

25:54.402 --> 25:55.803
what I'm saying to you.

25:55.871 --> 25:57.204
Why are you telling me this?

25:58.216 --> 26:01.842
When they ask you
why I did what I did,

26:01.910 --> 26:03.544
I want you to tell them.

26:03.612 --> 26:06.581
Okay, no one will blame
you for anything.

26:06.648 --> 26:09.050
You have done nothing wrong.

26:10.852 --> 26:13.187
I know this is very difficult

26:13.254 --> 26:15.422
for you to understand.

26:15.490 --> 26:17.892
But over time,
you will see.

26:21.296 --> 26:22.630
I love you, Hamid.

26:33.208 --> 26:34.520
You said today

26:36.096 --> 26:38.445
was a bad day to be a Muslim.

26:40.849 --> 26:43.383
Well, it's an even worse day
to be your brother.

26:46.822 --> 26:47.955
All right, let's go.

26:48.023 --> 26:50.087
Staging area's ready.

26:50.207 --> 26:51.826
You stay here and finish up.

26:51.893 --> 26:53.094
Understood.

26:53.161 --> 26:55.162
Jibraan, don't do this.

26:57.398 --> 26:58.666
Everything set?

26:58.734 --> 27:01.468
Yeah, was the brother convinced?

27:01.536 --> 27:02.737
I'm not sure.

27:02.804 --> 27:04.204
But even if he wasn't,

27:04.272 --> 27:06.440
once the attack
happens, he will be.

27:06.508 --> 27:08.509
Let's go.

27:29.370 --> 27:30.636
Hello?

27:30.704 --> 27:32.438
Hello?

27:32.506 --> 27:35.381
Yes, yes, Martin Collier said

27:35.501 --> 27:37.443
you'd be expecting my call.

27:37.511 --> 27:38.924
He gave me
the target's itinerary.

27:39.044 --> 27:40.680
I'm set to go.

27:40.748 --> 27:44.250
Good. Good, so the terms
are acceptable.

27:44.317 --> 27:45.752
They are.

27:45.819 --> 27:48.721
I just need you
to transfer the funds.

27:48.789 --> 27:50.222
What's the account number?

27:50.290 --> 27:52.291
International banking code is

27:52.359 --> 27:55.262
victor-six-bravo-one-bravo-one.

27:55.382 --> 27:57.894
Account number:
zero-five-nine

27:58.014 --> 28:01.973
-nine-zero-seven-two-four-seven.

28:02.093 --> 28:04.404
After the funds have been
transferred, I'll proceed.

28:04.471 --> 28:06.735
There'll be no need for us
to have any further contact.

28:06.855 --> 28:08.374
All right, but what are you--

28:10.110 --> 28:11.594
Hello?

28:25.191 --> 28:26.859
Yes?

28:26.927 --> 28:28.861
Excuse me, Ms. Taylor.

28:28.929 --> 28:30.430
I thought you should
know your father

28:30.497 --> 28:31.697
has asked to see you.

28:31.765 --> 28:32.965
My father's here?

28:33.033 --> 28:36.135
In light of the
potential bioweapon attack,

28:36.202 --> 28:37.403
the President ordered him moved

28:37.471 --> 28:38.838
to the White House
for his safety.

28:38.906 --> 28:41.073
Thank you, Aaron.

28:41.141 --> 28:42.775
I just have something
to take care of.

28:42.843 --> 28:44.143
Tell them I'll be right there.

28:44.210 --> 28:46.211
Yes, ma'am.

29:14.074 --> 29:17.109
??

29:24.284 --> 29:25.585
You've reached Martin Collier.

29:25.652 --> 29:27.954
Please leave a message.

29:28.021 --> 29:29.822
Martin, it's Olivia Taylor.

29:29.890 --> 29:31.457
I spoke to the contact,

29:31.525 --> 29:33.693
but I I uldn't
go through with it.

29:33.760 --> 29:36.362
I decided to take your
advice and walk away.

29:36.429 --> 29:38.898
Please call me
as soon as you can.

29:48.141 --> 29:49.842
This is Bauer.

29:49.910 --> 29:51.076
Jack, it's Chloe,
I found something

29:51.144 --> 29:53.045
weird about these hits
on Jibraan Al-Zarian.

29:53.113 --> 29:54.179
Go ahead.

29:54.247 --> 29:55.781
You know how I said that
the two million dollars

29:55.849 --> 29:57.116
was deposited
into his account

29:57.183 --> 29:58.417
over a period
of six months?

29:58.485 --> 30:00.085
Well, that wasn't right.
They were backdated.

30:00.153 --> 30:01.487
What do you mean?

30:01.555 --> 30:03.689
One of the trace algorithms
caught a discrepancy, all

30:03.757 --> 30:06.392
that money was really just
deposited 30 minutes ago.

30:06.459 --> 30:08.293
What about the extremist
websites he was visiting?

30:08.361 --> 30:10.362
Same thing with the time stamps.

30:10.430 --> 30:12.398
The hits were backdated
30 minutes ago.

30:12.465 --> 30:14.400
Are you absolutely positive?

30:14.467 --> 30:16.201
It looks that way.

30:16.269 --> 30:18.671
Jibraan could be innocent.

30:18.739 --> 30:19.872
Okay, thanks.

30:19.940 --> 30:22.241
What's going on, Jack?

30:22.308 --> 30:24.577
Chloe found evidence that
Jibraan is being set up.

30:24.645 --> 30:26.019
He's been framed.

30:26.139 --> 30:27.780
Why would Almeida
frame an innocent man?

30:27.848 --> 30:29.685
Because they wouldn't
want to risk the attack

30:29.805 --> 30:30.758
not being carried out properly.

30:30.878 --> 30:32.373
How could I be so stupid?

30:33.687 --> 30:36.022
An innocent man is so
much easier to control.

30:36.089 --> 30:37.690
All they needed
was a Muslim,

30:37.758 --> 30:40.042
they could create whatever
background they wanted.

30:42.829 --> 30:44.830
God...

30:46.851 --> 30:48.333
I am surprised.

30:48.401 --> 30:50.736
Why? You were right.

30:50.804 --> 30:52.872
Not about Jibraan.

30:52.940 --> 30:54.612
My experience
with the authorities,

30:54.732 --> 30:56.519
the police is that they
will go to any lengths

30:56.639 --> 30:58.678
not to admit
they were wrong.

30:58.745 --> 31:00.446
Even at the expense of an

31:00.513 --> 31:02.032
innocent man's life.

31:02.698 --> 31:04.225
At least you didn't do that.

31:05.919 --> 31:08.353
Please know that
I forgive you.

31:08.421 --> 31:10.884
I'm not asking
for your forgiveness.

31:11.908 --> 31:14.627
Then I hope you can
at least forgive yourself.

31:16.458 --> 31:18.831
I gave up on that
a long time ago.

31:22.069 --> 31:25.757
It's never to late to turn
towards God, Mr. Bauer.

31:34.547 --> 31:36.248
That's enough?
Yeah, thanks.

31:36.316 --> 31:37.883
Thank you.

31:39.452 --> 31:41.420
You don't need to
stay with me, Ally.

31:41.488 --> 31:43.723
But they know where to
find me if they need me.

31:45.729 --> 31:46.993
I thought it was
important for you

31:47.060 --> 31:49.328
to hear what's going on.

31:49.395 --> 31:52.965
And for you to understand
why I did what I did.

31:53.033 --> 31:55.001
You're the President,
sweetheart.

31:55.068 --> 31:56.974
You don't owe me an explanation.

31:58.193 --> 32:00.039
There's my girl.

32:00.107 --> 32:02.108
Hi, Dad.

32:04.611 --> 32:06.211
Livy, you can
squeeze a bit harder.

32:06.279 --> 32:07.634
I won't break.

32:07.754 --> 32:08.914
Oh, I might!

32:11.484 --> 32:12.818
I'm sorry I couldn't
come to the hospital.

32:12.886 --> 32:14.654
Don't be silly.

32:14.721 --> 32:17.990
You're a godsend being
here helping your mom.

32:18.058 --> 32:21.861
Just knowing you two
were speaking again,

32:21.928 --> 32:23.896
let alone working together,
that's enough.

32:23.964 --> 32:27.700
Henry, I'm not sure
that our détente

32:27.768 --> 32:29.869
is holding
at the moment.

32:30.904 --> 32:34.640
Olivia, your mother told me

32:34.708 --> 32:37.209
about the deal she
made with Jonas Hodges.

32:38.945 --> 32:41.047
And I know you,
understandably,

32:41.114 --> 32:44.116
have serious concerns
about that.

32:45.919 --> 32:48.854
Well, I've had
some time to think.

32:48.922 --> 32:53.059
To put myself in Mom's position.

32:53.126 --> 32:54.873
To be objective

32:54.993 --> 32:57.229
and pragmatic--

32:57.297 --> 32:59.231
the way a good leader
should be.

32:59.299 --> 33:01.233
Has to be.

33:01.301 --> 33:02.401
I know that decision

33:02.468 --> 33:04.436
was horrible
for you.

33:04.504 --> 33:07.139
But I do understand.

33:07.207 --> 33:10.776
I'm sorry I made the choice
even harder.

33:10.844 --> 33:15.815
Jonas Hodges will face
judgment one day.

33:15.882 --> 33:18.684
If not in this life,
in the next.

33:48.906 --> 33:50.716
Mr. Tippet.

33:53.754 --> 33:55.755
Mr. Tippet.

33:56.957 --> 33:59.169
Oh. Sorry.

34:00.394 --> 34:02.261
It's going to take me
a little while to
get used to that.

34:02.328 --> 34:03.929
Always does.

34:03.997 --> 34:06.265
I'll need to confiscate
the wallet.

34:06.332 --> 34:07.867
We can't let you
hold on to anything

34:07.934 --> 34:09.592
that ties you
to your former life.

34:14.407 --> 34:16.408
And the picture.

34:31.690 --> 34:33.625
You like your job,
Mr. Sullivan?

34:33.693 --> 34:35.627
It has its
challenges.

34:35.695 --> 34:36.996
You strike me

34:37.063 --> 34:39.665
as someone who wouldn't
be totally satisfied

34:39.732 --> 34:41.667
ferrying prisoners around.

34:41.734 --> 34:44.402
I don't plan on doing this
my entire life.

34:44.469 --> 34:47.406
Good to hear that.

34:47.473 --> 34:51.076
Maybe you and I can do
some work together some day.

34:51.143 --> 34:52.377
Sir?

34:52.445 --> 34:55.147
I don't intend to be
Mr. Tippet forever.

35:17.470 --> 35:20.072
Sign here acknowledging
transfer.

35:55.120 --> 35:56.279
FBI's identified

35:56.280 --> 35:57.447
the man they believe is going

35:57.515 --> 35:59.583
to carry out the
bioweapon's attack.

35:59.650 --> 36:01.318
Jack Bauer and Agent Walker
are on their way

36:01.385 --> 36:03.353
to a possible location
for him.
Have they found out

36:03.421 --> 36:05.155
anything that would give us
an idea of the target--

36:05.223 --> 36:06.823
or a timetable?
No.

36:06.890 --> 36:08.251
Nothing actionable. Not yet.

36:08.371 --> 36:09.947
Um, Madam President.

36:12.889 --> 36:14.206
This is Woods.

36:16.416 --> 36:17.878
Are you sure?

36:21.307 --> 36:22.380
How did this happen?

36:24.992 --> 36:25.535
Call me

36:25.655 --> 36:26.504
as soon as you know more.

36:31.901 --> 36:33.409
What is it, Tim?

36:34.199 --> 36:35.733
Jonas Hodges was just killed.

36:35.853 --> 36:36.886
What?

36:36.954 --> 36:38.188
How?
Car bomb.

36:38.256 --> 36:39.489
As he was leaving FBI.

36:40.501 --> 36:41.936
What else do they know?

36:42.056 --> 36:44.194
Are there any
suspects?
Not yet.

36:44.262 --> 36:46.397
Um, excuse me.

36:53.469 --> 36:56.039
My guess is this was
an inside job.

36:56.538 --> 36:57.574
Inside job?

36:57.983 --> 36:59.176
Whoever ordered the hit

36:59.243 --> 37:01.586
knew exactly when and where
Hodges was being transported.

37:01.706 --> 37:02.912
Damn it!

37:04.077 --> 37:05.682
Tim, get on
top of this.

37:05.749 --> 37:06.406
I want to know

37:06.526 --> 37:08.251
exactly how this happened.

37:08.319 --> 37:09.786
Yes, Ma'am.

37:16.294 --> 37:19.296
Ms. Taylor,

37:19.826 --> 37:21.331
is everything all right?

37:21.399 --> 37:22.899
Oh, it's fine.

37:22.966 --> 37:24.517
I'll be right back.

37:32.243 --> 37:33.142
Yeah?

37:33.470 --> 37:35.178
Hodges is dead!

37:35.246 --> 37:36.580
Okay, calm down.

37:36.647 --> 37:38.114
We shouldn't be talking
on the phone.

37:38.182 --> 37:39.782
You don't understand,

37:39.850 --> 37:41.351
there's been a
terrible mistake.

37:41.419 --> 37:43.876
I spoke to the man whose
number you gave me.

37:43.996 --> 37:45.288
But I didn't go
through with it.

37:45.356 --> 37:46.389
I couldn't.

37:46.457 --> 37:47.424
Didn't you get
my message?

37:47.491 --> 37:48.525
Olivia,
I said calm down.

37:48.593 --> 37:50.026
I can't!

37:50.094 --> 37:51.956
Hodges is dead
and I'm responsible.

37:52.076 --> 37:53.930
We cannot have this conversation
over the phone.

37:53.997 --> 37:55.031
Do you understand?
Do you realize

37:55.099 --> 37:56.299
what could happen to me
if this gets out?!

37:56.367 --> 37:58.067
Olivia, you need to stop
talking now.

37:58.135 --> 37:59.068
Do you hear me?

37:59.136 --> 38:00.870
Take a deep breath,
listen to me.

38:00.938 --> 38:02.138
All right,
we'll hang up, okay?

38:02.206 --> 38:03.306
All right.

38:03.374 --> 38:04.374
Okay, I'm listening.

38:04.442 --> 38:05.642
Okay.

38:05.710 --> 38:07.310
Can you get
to Pershing Park?

38:07.378 --> 38:08.578
No, not right now.

38:08.646 --> 38:10.213
Fine.
I'm in a meeting with my mother.

38:10.281 --> 38:12.382
I'll wait. Get there
as fast as you can.

38:12.450 --> 38:14.718
We'll talk about this
face-to-face.

38:14.785 --> 38:15.952
Okay?

38:16.019 --> 38:17.897
All right.

38:35.373 --> 38:37.374
Thank you, Aaron.

38:58.596 --> 39:00.363
What do you have,
Agent?

39:00.431 --> 39:02.532
Armed hostile in the back room,
holding a hostage.

39:02.600 --> 39:03.600
What about Almeida?

39:03.668 --> 39:04.701
He's not
in there.

39:04.769 --> 39:06.303
See for yourself.
Reed,

39:06.370 --> 39:08.070
give us another look.
Yes, sir.

39:11.999 --> 39:13.677
Move in closer on the hostage.

39:15.681 --> 39:16.813
Is that who you're
looking for?

39:16.880 --> 39:18.147
No.

39:18.215 --> 39:20.317
That's Jibraan's
brother, Hamid.

39:21.287 --> 39:22.852
They're using him as leverage,
to make Jibraan

39:22.920 --> 39:24.053
do what they want.

39:24.121 --> 39:25.288
How can you be sure?
'Cause that's

39:25.356 --> 39:27.190
what I would've done.
Agent, it is imperative

39:27.257 --> 39:28.525
that we take this
hostile alive.

39:28.592 --> 39:30.226
Right now, he's our only
shot at finding out

39:30.294 --> 39:31.528
where this attack is
going taking place.

39:31.595 --> 39:33.062
Understood. I've already
informed my men.

39:33.130 --> 39:34.364
I want to run point on this.
Is that all right?

39:35.198 --> 39:36.665
Thanks.

39:37.267 --> 39:38.401
You're going
to stay here

39:38.469 --> 39:40.169
with the backup teams.

39:40.237 --> 39:41.838
Are you sure that's
such a good idea?

39:41.905 --> 39:43.163
What?

39:43.907 --> 39:46.209
Agent Bauer-- he doesn't
seem to be too well.

39:46.276 --> 39:47.377
Maybe you should

39:47.445 --> 39:49.045
be in charge.
I am.

39:52.583 --> 39:54.445
Jack was infected
with the bioweapon.

39:54.565 --> 39:55.084
The same one

39:55.152 --> 39:56.653
that they are going to
use in this attack.

39:56.721 --> 39:58.135
Then he should be
in the hospital.

39:58.255 --> 39:59.288
There is no treatment.

39:59.357 --> 40:01.224
He probably has less
than a day to live.

40:01.291 --> 40:03.693
So if he is strong enough,
trust me, he's the best

40:03.761 --> 40:05.061
person for this job.

40:05.128 --> 40:06.229
I'm sorry,

40:06.296 --> 40:07.564
I didn't realize.

40:07.631 --> 40:09.566
Agent Walker,
we're ready.

40:09.633 --> 40:11.568
Please, Mr. Bauer,

40:11.635 --> 40:12.902
do what you can to save

40:12.970 --> 40:14.903
Hamid.
We've checked
the windows.

40:15.228 --> 40:16.205
We have a clear approach.

40:17.241 --> 40:19.075
Let's go.
Agents,

40:19.142 --> 40:20.981
stay with Mr. Gohar.

40:51.575 --> 40:53.610
??

40:56.873 --> 40:58.214
On my count.

40:58.282 --> 41:01.284
Three... two... one.

41:08.325 --> 41:09.793
Hamid, stop!

41:10.589 --> 41:11.628
Put it down.

41:11.695 --> 41:13.897
We're FBI. We need him alive.

41:13.964 --> 41:15.965
Put it down.
He made my brother
into a terrorist.

41:16.033 --> 41:17.567
Your brother is not a terrorist.
He's innocent.

41:17.635 --> 41:19.001
We know that.
He's being set up.

41:19.069 --> 41:20.002
He's being forced

41:20.070 --> 41:21.438
to do this.
Please.
What?

41:21.505 --> 41:22.772
The only one who
can tell us

41:22.840 --> 41:24.974
where your brother is
that man right there.

41:25.042 --> 41:27.043
Now put it down.

41:28.679 --> 41:31.221
Stand up now, put your hands
behind your head.

41:31.341 --> 41:32.649
Do it!

41:32.716 --> 41:35.051
Agent Walker, move in now.

41:36.036 --> 41:37.201
Move, on the bed.

41:40.456 --> 41:42.927
Damn it, he's bleeding out.
We need a medic, now!

41:43.360 --> 41:45.240
We need a med team on site.

42:15.205 --> 42:16.827
Sit right there.

42:20.865 --> 42:22.098
Are you in their system?

42:22.165 --> 42:24.133
I've tapped into the main
security trunk line,

42:24.201 --> 42:25.869
but I'm still looping in
breakers to make sure

42:25.936 --> 42:27.370
the tap doesn't
get flagged.

42:27.437 --> 42:30.019
All right, well, we're
on a timetable here.

42:30.139 --> 42:31.207
How much longer is it
going to take?

42:31.274 --> 42:33.075
Ten, maybe 15 minutes.

42:33.143 --> 42:34.541
Hand me that case.

42:37.047 --> 42:39.181
What are you going
to have me do?

42:40.083 --> 42:41.684
You'll find out
soon enough.

42:50.427 --> 42:52.028
Is the subway
on schedule?

42:52.467 --> 42:53.897
Yeah, it's on schedule.
