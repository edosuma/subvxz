WEBVTT

00:01.545 --> 00:04.826
And all the blessings, all the glory,

00:04.828 --> 00:07.069
all the honor are on you, Lord.

00:07.071 --> 00:09.471
In your son's name, amen.

00:09.473 --> 00:10.632
Amen.

00:10.634 --> 00:11.793
- That's right.
- Let's eat.

00:11.795 --> 00:13.395
This looks delicious, babe.

00:13.397 --> 00:14.796
I mean, damn, Ma.

00:14.798 --> 00:16.238
You put your foot in this.

00:16.239 --> 00:18.280
I know! This looks so good!

00:18.282 --> 00:20.402
Thank you, baby. And if
you cuss like that again,

00:20.404 --> 00:21.883
I'm gonna pop you in your mouth. Okay?

00:21.885 --> 00:23.125
You see that?

00:23.127 --> 00:24.526
You see that, Tray?

00:24.528 --> 00:25.847
You're not the only one who know how to

00:25.849 --> 00:27.209
throw down in the kitchen.

00:27.211 --> 00:29.011
I see you, Shay. I know your skill's

00:29.013 --> 00:31.373
a little bit more Lawry's,
one pack of adobo.

00:31.375 --> 00:33.194
I know how you get down.

00:33.196 --> 00:35.420
Am I the only one that think
it's weird that Mom cooked?

00:35.422 --> 00:37.505
What, a woman can't cook for her family?

00:40.884 --> 00:43.685
Okay, fine. I have an
announcement to make.

00:43.687 --> 00:46.127
Now, as you all know, Faith
and I have been meeting

00:46.129 --> 00:50.072
with investors to try to get
funding for our fashion line,

00:50.074 --> 00:53.355
and I'm very happy to
announce that as of yesterday,

00:53.357 --> 00:55.517
we are fully funded!

00:55.519 --> 00:56.798
- Oh!
- What?

00:56.800 --> 00:59.641
- Nice, nice.
- Congratulations, Mom!

00:59.643 --> 01:01.723
And we're opening up our own factory.

01:01.725 --> 01:03.485
- You got a factory?
- Mm-hmm.

01:03.487 --> 01:05.087
Man, I knew you could do it, Shay.

01:05.089 --> 01:07.369
You're gonna change the
game with your fashion sense.

01:07.371 --> 01:10.492
Yeah, and, uh, there's more.

01:10.494 --> 01:15.299
And we're also moving
to beautiful New Jersey.

01:18.542 --> 01:19.742
What?

01:19.744 --> 01:20.943
Jersey?

01:20.945 --> 01:22.044
- Mm-hmm.
- Why?

01:22.046 --> 01:23.085
Can't do that, Shay.

01:23.087 --> 01:24.666
My kids can't be Bridge and Tunnel.

01:24.668 --> 01:25.867
I don't have a car.

01:25.869 --> 01:27.469
I know this seems all of a sudden

01:27.471 --> 01:28.871
and, like, out of nowhere,

01:28.873 --> 01:31.193
but this is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

01:31.195 --> 01:32.835
I can't let this pass me by.

01:32.837 --> 01:34.677
It's like a million miles away!

01:34.679 --> 01:36.839
What if y'all get busy? I
ain't never gonna see y'all!

01:36.841 --> 01:38.720
- That's not true.
- This isn't fair!

01:38.722 --> 01:39.782
I don't want to move.

01:39.784 --> 01:41.243
I can't leave in the
middle of high school.

01:41.245 --> 01:42.484
Isn't that against the law?

01:42.486 --> 01:44.927
See, Shay? You breaking the law!

01:44.929 --> 01:48.050
Come on, guys. Maybe
we need to look at this

01:48.052 --> 01:49.812
from a different perspective, right?

01:49.814 --> 01:51.333
What other perspective is there?

01:51.335 --> 01:54.737
Well, instead of looking
at moving as a bad thing,

01:54.739 --> 01:57.620
look at starting over as an opportunity.

01:57.622 --> 01:59.862
You know? An opportunity to...

01:59.864 --> 02:02.504
to make new friends or
to reinvent yourself.

02:02.506 --> 02:04.186
The only people who need to start over

02:04.188 --> 02:07.670
are people whose lives suck.

02:07.672 --> 02:09.832
I can tell you my perspective on it.

02:09.834 --> 02:11.594
This is bullshit.

02:11.596 --> 02:13.996
- Tray...
- Bullshit.

02:13.998 --> 02:17.003
I hate this family.

02:21.486 --> 02:22.925
Well...

02:22.927 --> 02:24.847
... that couldn't have gone any worse.

02:34.499 --> 02:36.459
All right, Tray, what's going on?

02:36.461 --> 02:38.501
It's Shay.

02:38.503 --> 02:41.343
She's talking about moving
my family to New Jersey

02:41.345 --> 02:42.585
and abandoning me.

02:42.587 --> 02:45.327
Okay. Tray, sweetie,
I know this is hard,

02:45.329 --> 02:48.873
but how is a grown woman
with her own family

02:48.875 --> 02:52.436
abandoning you, a grown
man with his own life?

02:52.438 --> 02:54.358
It's just something you
wouldn't understand.

02:54.360 --> 02:57.842
Tray, I totally understand.

02:57.844 --> 02:59.243
I actually lost my best friend.

02:59.245 --> 03:00.324
Really?

03:00.326 --> 03:02.286
Yeah.

03:02.288 --> 03:03.751
But then I found him under my bed.

03:03.753 --> 03:06.056
Okay.

03:06.058 --> 03:09.102
Separation is really, really hard.

03:09.104 --> 03:10.667
I mean, when I left my parents house,

03:10.669 --> 03:13.017
I... I would've never
made it without Mr. Winky.

03:13.019 --> 03:14.451
So you grew up in San Diego?

03:14.453 --> 03:15.515
No, actually.

03:15.517 --> 03:18.342
I grew up in Portland,
and I loved Oregon State.

03:18.344 --> 03:19.784
Go Beavers!

03:19.786 --> 03:22.253
Um... but unfortunately,
I was allergic to rodents,

03:22.255 --> 03:25.055
so I got Mr. Winky because
he reminds me of a beaver.

03:25.057 --> 03:26.457
But you're not allergic
to stuffed animals,

03:26.459 --> 03:27.721
so it doesn't really make sense.

03:27.723 --> 03:29.260
All right, so I see
you guys don't get it.

03:29.262 --> 03:30.601
I'm gonna go home and get some sleep.

03:30.603 --> 03:31.702
Be good.

03:31.704 --> 03:32.903
- All right.
- Thank you, Isis.

03:32.905 --> 03:33.944
Thank you, Luna.

03:33.946 --> 03:36.667
- Night.
- Night.

03:36.669 --> 03:38.709
See, when you bring that
out, it scares people.

03:38.711 --> 03:40.911
- Why?
- It's just... it's confusing.

03:53.126 --> 03:54.525
I've been expecting you.

03:54.527 --> 03:56.127
Something is stressing you.

03:56.129 --> 03:57.848
My world is changing, OG.

03:57.850 --> 03:59.330
Just when I put things together,

03:59.332 --> 04:00.891
she's trying to tear it apart.

04:00.893 --> 04:02.733
And is she the one that
took care of your kids

04:02.735 --> 04:04.375
for 15 years while you were gone?

04:04.377 --> 04:06.137
- Yes.
- And isn't she the one

04:06.139 --> 04:08.019
that loaned you that
money for the food truck?

04:08.021 --> 04:09.500
- Yes, but...
- So how much does someone

04:09.502 --> 04:11.302
have to do to get your appreciation?

04:11.304 --> 04:12.823
Love is sacrifice.

04:12.825 --> 04:14.745
And her joy should bring you happiness.

04:14.747 --> 04:16.187
She's trying to take my kids,

04:16.189 --> 04:17.788
and I'm just not ready to let them go.

04:17.790 --> 04:20.190
Was Elliot ready to let ET go home, huh?

04:20.192 --> 04:22.473
And was that little white
boy ready to free Willy?

04:22.475 --> 04:25.436
And was, who, Kelly and Michelle
ready to let BeyoncÃ© go?

04:25.438 --> 04:29.680
Maybe Kelly, but Farrah Franklin
is still salty to this day.

04:29.682 --> 04:33.052
Don't see this as the end,
see it as the beginning.

04:33.054 --> 04:35.798
The caterpillar that
holds on to the cocoon

04:35.800 --> 04:38.609
will never see the brighter
day as being a butterfly.

04:38.611 --> 04:41.813
Now leave me. I must
get back to my podcast.

04:50.103 --> 04:51.342
Aaah!

04:56.029 --> 04:59.483
Okay, the moving truck will
be here in exactly one hour.

04:59.485 --> 05:01.748
- One hour.
- Shahzad, I need you to finish

05:01.750 --> 05:04.195
packing up your room and
the bathroom upstairs.

05:04.197 --> 05:06.157
- Got that? Okay.
- Yes, ma'am.

05:06.159 --> 05:08.639
Josh, honey, I need you to
finish packing your stuff, okay?

05:08.641 --> 05:10.401
- Aye aye, Captain.
- Mwah!

05:10.403 --> 05:11.562
Gross.

05:11.564 --> 05:13.904
And, Amira, I need you to
finish packing your room

05:13.906 --> 05:15.626
and the storage closet upstairs.

05:15.628 --> 05:17.568
And the movers will
take care of the rest.

05:17.570 --> 05:19.370
- Is that clear?
- Yeah.

05:19.372 --> 05:20.812
What was that?

05:20.814 --> 05:22.413
When am I gonna say
goodbye to my friends?

05:22.415 --> 05:24.475
Hey, Amira, I know it's hard,

05:24.477 --> 05:27.098
but we all got to pitch in, all right?

05:27.100 --> 05:28.820
Yes, ma'am.

05:32.586 --> 05:33.785
Hello?

05:33.787 --> 05:36.267
Yes, this is Shannon Birkeland.

05:36.269 --> 05:38.710
My family and I are looking
forward to your arrival.

05:38.712 --> 05:41.833
Well, I hope you have a
wonderful day, as well.

05:41.835 --> 05:43.234
Thank you so much.

05:43.236 --> 05:45.156
Okay, bye-bye.

05:45.158 --> 05:47.078
I thought you only used your white voice

05:47.080 --> 05:48.162
on job interviews?

05:48.164 --> 05:51.202
Well, I also use my white
voice to get good service.

05:51.204 --> 05:52.644
Ah, okay. If you wanted good service,

05:52.646 --> 05:54.786
why didn't you just hire
a black moving company?

05:54.788 --> 05:55.887
You funny.

05:55.889 --> 05:58.690
See, I only hire culturally appropriate.

05:58.692 --> 06:01.052
So, black for hair. Asian for nails.

06:01.054 --> 06:02.814
Latino for repairs.

06:02.816 --> 06:05.376
And white when I want a service
that's insured and bonded.

06:05.378 --> 06:07.739
- Isn't that racist?
- Only when you say it.

06:07.741 --> 06:10.221
See, I don't want anyone
coming up in here late,

06:10.223 --> 06:12.808
breaking my shit,
and then they don't have

06:12.810 --> 06:14.265
no insurance to get it repaired,

06:14.267 --> 06:16.027
and then they mad because I'm mad.

06:16.029 --> 06:18.029
Okay. I understand.

06:18.031 --> 06:19.070
Sounds racist, though.

06:19.072 --> 06:20.972
Racist? You calling me racist?
You got me messed up.

06:20.974 --> 06:22.334
I'm sleeping in the bed with a white man

06:22.336 --> 06:24.396
every night that smell like
a pound puppy when he get wet.

06:24.398 --> 06:25.917
- Smell like a what?
- No... Nothing.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.919
You heard me? I thought
that was in my mind.

06:32.085 --> 06:35.046
Ha! See? They're early. I told you.

06:35.048 --> 06:36.127
Yep.

06:36.129 --> 06:38.129
Mm-hmm.

06:43.417 --> 06:44.616
Ms. Birkeland home?

06:44.618 --> 06:46.538
I am Mrs. Birkeland. Who are you?

06:46.540 --> 06:48.380
I'm Runson Cole, Noble American Movers.

06:48.382 --> 06:50.342
Where's the man that I
spoke with on the phone?

06:50.344 --> 06:52.383
Oh, that was me. I was
using my white voice.

06:52.385 --> 06:53.585
You know how it is, sista.

06:53.587 --> 06:55.267
- Well, where's the truck?
- Truck's on the way.

06:55.269 --> 06:58.274
I was just showing up early to
let you know we gon' be late.

07:01.995 --> 07:03.875
Hell nah.

07:03.877 --> 07:06.939
Can you believe this shit?!

07:15.112 --> 07:17.575
- Shit.
- Okay, so, we all set here.

07:17.577 --> 07:19.230
We just got to do this last
little bit of paperwork.

07:19.232 --> 07:21.376
We need a 50% deposit in cash.

07:21.378 --> 07:23.400
Excuse me? You didn't mention
that on the phone earlier.

07:23.402 --> 07:24.425
You know how it is, sista.

07:24.427 --> 07:26.530
Uh, can you put it on my card?

07:26.532 --> 07:28.435
Your card?

07:28.437 --> 07:29.939
Works for me.

07:29.941 --> 07:31.364
Mr. Josh.

07:31.366 --> 07:33.629
All right, we in the game.
Where are your boxes?

07:33.631 --> 07:35.414
Boxes? I... I don't have any boxes.

07:35.416 --> 07:38.380
I purchased the Gold Package,
which includes the boxes.

07:38.382 --> 07:39.964
No, no, no, no, no.

07:39.966 --> 07:42.269
That's the Gold Plus Package.

07:42.271 --> 07:44.014
Which I'm more than
happy to upgrade you to

07:44.016 --> 07:45.539
for the low price of $99.99.

07:45.541 --> 07:47.563
- That'll be fine.
- All right, thank you, Mr. Josh.

07:47.565 --> 07:48.604
Mm-hmm.

07:48.606 --> 07:52.368
Oh!

08:01.980 --> 08:04.140
Shahzad, what is this mess?

08:04.142 --> 08:05.581
You're supposed to be packing.

08:05.583 --> 08:06.863
I'm organizing.

08:06.865 --> 08:08.504
Nothing about this says organized.

08:08.506 --> 08:10.786
I got this under control.

08:10.788 --> 08:13.789
This pile, this is the old Shahzad.

08:13.791 --> 08:16.072
I'm gonna give to the
children's hospital.

08:16.074 --> 08:17.753
Appropriate, right?

08:17.755 --> 08:19.355
This pile...

08:19.357 --> 08:21.157
This is the new Shahzad.

08:21.159 --> 08:24.080
A.K.A. Zad 'Da God.

08:24.082 --> 08:26.562
There's a lot of losers out there, Mom,

08:26.564 --> 08:29.569
and I'm not one of them anymore.

08:31.890 --> 08:34.049
Pack this stuff up!

08:41.740 --> 08:45.945
_

08:57.515 --> 08:59.395
Yo, that was close!

08:59.397 --> 09:03.119
They don't call me Lucky for nothin'.

09:04.763 --> 09:06.422
Why isn't he wrapping those plates?

09:06.424 --> 09:07.804
- You want them wrapped?
- Of course.

09:07.806 --> 09:10.406
How else are they gonna get from
point A to point B without breaking?

09:10.408 --> 09:11.648
- Bubble or paper?
- Bubble.

09:11.650 --> 09:13.369
Oh, you fancy, huh?

09:13.371 --> 09:15.451
Trying to upgrade to
the Platinum Package.

09:15.453 --> 09:17.053
Mr. Josh!

09:19.097 --> 09:21.778
Hey, man, you want to keep all these?

09:21.780 --> 09:23.861
- Yeah.
- Josh, I need you to go downstairs

09:23.863 --> 09:26.142
and talk to Runson.
You haven't finished packing?

09:26.144 --> 09:28.104
What have you been doing?

09:28.106 --> 09:30.306
And why is he wearing your shoes?

09:30.308 --> 09:31.788
You takin' these, too?

09:31.790 --> 09:33.349
No, look, I found my old script.

09:33.351 --> 09:36.020
You know, I haven't looked at
this thing in, like, 10 years.

09:36.022 --> 09:38.354
And you have the rest of your
life to finish reading it.

09:38.356 --> 09:39.756
But we're moving right now,

09:39.758 --> 09:42.458
and I am one upgrade away
from killing somebody.

09:42.460 --> 09:44.200
I'll be down in a minute, honey. Okay?

09:44.202 --> 09:46.002
This is why women in jail now.

09:46.004 --> 09:47.684
This is why women go to jail.

09:47.686 --> 09:49.169
Like, I've worked so hard to
get to where I am socially.

09:49.171 --> 09:51.380
I have a solid friend group,
I don't have to explain

09:51.382 --> 09:53.782
why I have a white
Dad, and I was finally

09:53.784 --> 09:55.384
making progress on the boy front.

09:55.386 --> 09:57.550
Yeah, I mean, you've grown
so much since middle school.

09:57.552 --> 09:59.455
- Leaps and bounds.
- If there was an award

09:59.457 --> 10:01.540
for most improved, it would go to you.

10:01.542 --> 10:02.645
Well, it doesn't matter now

10:02.647 --> 10:04.356
because I have to start all over.

10:05.402 --> 10:07.305
Amira! Unlock this door!

10:07.307 --> 10:09.958
I'm not leaving! I do
not belong in Jersey.

10:09.960 --> 10:11.904
Amira, sweetheart!

10:11.906 --> 10:13.411
Come on.

10:17.648 --> 10:19.008
Excuse you!

10:19.010 --> 10:20.609
Hey, Ms. Birkeland.

10:20.611 --> 10:23.252
How much y'all pay to live here?

10:23.254 --> 10:25.134
- Runson!
- At your service.

10:25.136 --> 10:27.193
Your so-called employee

10:27.195 --> 10:30.539
is supposed to be moving my
refrigerator, but instead,

10:30.541 --> 10:32.101
he is eating my food

10:32.103 --> 10:34.386
and asking me questions
about my business.

10:34.388 --> 10:35.698
So he cleaning out the fridge?

10:35.700 --> 10:37.723
That's gonna cost you extra. Mr. Josh!

10:37.725 --> 10:39.127
I can't stand this bullshit no more.

10:39.129 --> 10:40.429
You know what? I'm calling the owner.

10:40.431 --> 10:41.931
Oh, no, no, no, no, don't
do that, don't do that.

10:41.933 --> 10:43.152
Come on, sista, don't do that.

10:46.077 --> 10:48.918
Noble American Movers,
no hassles, no headaches.

10:48.920 --> 10:50.342
Ah, shit.

10:50.344 --> 10:51.647
Where... where is she going?

10:51.649 --> 10:53.122
I told her she could say
goodbye to her friends.

10:53.124 --> 10:55.664
- Uh, no she can't.
- My old screenplay.

10:55.666 --> 10:57.086
It's actually pretty good.

10:57.088 --> 10:59.632
It has some plot holes. I
had notes on the third act.

10:59.634 --> 11:01.817
I mean, I'm really
gonna miss this house.

11:01.819 --> 11:04.173
I wrote some of my...
my best scripts here.

11:04.175 --> 11:06.655
It's got this, like, special energy

11:06.657 --> 11:09.058
that makes my words kind
of jump off the page,

11:09.060 --> 11:10.619
and I... I don't know
if I'm gonna be able

11:10.621 --> 11:11.981
to finish this when we get to Jersey.

11:11.983 --> 11:13.462
You know what? I don't want to hear

11:13.464 --> 11:15.224
another word about this script, Josh.

11:15.226 --> 11:17.626
You had 10 years to finish it, okay?

11:17.628 --> 11:19.829
Now, I need you for
something, and all I'm getting

11:19.831 --> 11:22.071
is pushback, tantrums, and complaints.

11:22.073 --> 11:24.473
Whoa, whoa. When did
we get into attack mode?

11:24.475 --> 11:26.836
Oh, a better question is
when are you gonna stop

11:26.838 --> 11:29.478
being so damn lazy and do some work?

11:29.480 --> 11:32.121
Oh. You know what? Maybe Tray was right.

11:32.123 --> 11:34.443
Maybe this move isn't the right decision

11:34.445 --> 11:35.644
for the whole family.

11:35.646 --> 11:36.991
Yo, heads up!

11:40.430 --> 11:42.013
What the hell?!

11:42.015 --> 11:43.758
We on yo' dime. We
trying to save you time.

11:49.180 --> 11:50.663
You still want me to wrap that?

11:50.665 --> 11:52.608
You know what? Get out.

11:52.610 --> 11:53.792
Y'all is fired.

11:53.794 --> 11:55.617
Get the f[BLEEP] out of my house!

11:55.619 --> 11:57.619
Y'all heard the lady.

12:00.649 --> 12:02.149
Shit!

12:03.966 --> 12:05.189
I'm sorry.

12:05.191 --> 12:07.574
And you're taking my milk, too?

12:07.576 --> 12:09.279
That's why you look pregnant!

12:11.866 --> 12:14.910
I've been there for
everybody all these years,

12:14.912 --> 12:17.856
but then when it's my turn,
no one's there for me.

12:17.858 --> 12:21.170
I was in labor for 18 hours
with you and your brother.

12:21.172 --> 12:23.973
Do you know how hard
it is to take care of

12:23.975 --> 12:27.096
infant twins by yourself?

12:27.098 --> 12:30.139
I didn't sleep for five years.

12:30.141 --> 12:32.141
And you.

12:32.143 --> 12:35.224
I supported you and
your Narc Anon meetings.

12:35.226 --> 12:36.946
I went to all of them!

12:36.948 --> 12:38.388
I took the bus.

12:38.390 --> 12:40.630
I even went on my birthday.

12:40.632 --> 12:43.152
Have either of you ever
wanted for anything?

12:43.154 --> 12:47.276
I put my dreams on hold to
give you the life you have.

12:47.278 --> 12:49.839
And I ask for one thing,

12:49.841 --> 12:52.846
and all you can do is
think about yourselves.

12:58.650 --> 13:00.650
Zad 'Da God ready to go!

13:03.174 --> 13:04.534
I'm f[BLEEP] done with y'all.

13:04.536 --> 13:06.456
Deal with you guys.

13:11.262 --> 13:14.944
Well, that was a little dramatic.

13:14.946 --> 13:16.946
Mm-hmm. You got that.

13:19.390 --> 13:21.631
What's going on here?

13:21.633 --> 13:22.952
Where's your mother?

13:22.954 --> 13:24.313
She took off.

13:24.315 --> 13:26.295
Mom went ballistic because none of us

13:26.297 --> 13:28.557
were helping, so now the move is off.

13:28.559 --> 13:31.380
This thing has got everybody
a little bit on edge.

13:31.382 --> 13:32.802
I've been thinking about your moving.

13:32.804 --> 13:36.566
I felt the same way
when I came out the penn.

13:36.568 --> 13:38.728
Didn't know if I'd have anyone.

13:38.730 --> 13:41.731
Didn't know what my future would be.

13:41.733 --> 13:45.294
Then everybody was there,
and everything worked out,

13:45.296 --> 13:48.297
and I realized that if
we support one another,

13:48.299 --> 13:52.261
no matter what happens in life,
everything is gonna be okay.

13:52.263 --> 13:55.982
This will be okay!

13:55.984 --> 13:57.446
He's right. All right.

13:57.448 --> 13:58.810
You know what we gotta do, right?

13:58.812 --> 13:59.874
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.

13:59.876 --> 14:01.059
I'll take the kitchen.

14:01.061 --> 14:03.284
- I'll get the office.
- I'll get extra bodies.

14:03.286 --> 14:04.909
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

14:04.911 --> 14:06.911
Come on, hustle.

14:26.174 --> 14:28.775
Okay, here we go. Look forward.

14:28.777 --> 14:30.256
And there you go.

14:30.258 --> 14:32.178
Wow, look how tall I am!

14:32.180 --> 14:34.140
That's pretty tall! That's pretty tall.

14:34.142 --> 14:35.862
Amira, get in here.

14:35.864 --> 14:38.184
Let's see if you beat Shahzad.

14:38.186 --> 14:39.906
What do you got?

14:39.908 --> 14:42.028
Ohh, this is what happens.

14:42.030 --> 14:43.189
Amira ate her vegetables.

14:43.191 --> 14:45.712
- Ooh!
- Oh, my gosh.

15:05.494 --> 15:09.576
Amira, baby, have you
seen my eye shadow?

15:09.578 --> 15:11.418
No.

15:19.188 --> 15:23.393
_

15:26.915 --> 15:28.755
Box!

15:28.757 --> 15:30.877
Rectangle!

15:30.879 --> 15:32.338
- Brick!
- Yeah!

15:32.340 --> 15:33.500
Come on, my turn.

15:33.502 --> 15:34.801
- All right.
- Let's go.

15:34.803 --> 15:37.644
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

15:39.168 --> 15:40.364
The crew is here!

15:40.366 --> 15:41.388
- Hey.
- Hey!

15:41.390 --> 15:42.529
- Hi.
- Hey!

15:42.531 --> 15:43.750
- Hi.
- Hey, Tray.

15:43.752 --> 15:45.135
- Hey!
- Welcome, welcome.

15:45.137 --> 15:46.933
- Yeah.
- Thanks for coming, guys.

15:46.935 --> 15:49.275
So, county records lists
this house as being

15:49.277 --> 15:50.337
about 1,200 square feet.

15:50.339 --> 15:53.460
Should take us 3.5 hours
if we stagger our breaks.

15:53.462 --> 15:55.862
You guys heard what the
man said. Let's get to work!

15:55.864 --> 15:57.664
- Okay.
- Come on.

15:59.428 --> 16:01.788
Okay, guys, how long is this gonna take?

16:01.790 --> 16:04.992
And be very careful with
that. It's very important.

16:04.994 --> 16:07.614
Hey, girl! How's the move going, huh?

16:07.616 --> 16:08.675
Huh? It didn't.

16:08.677 --> 16:10.357
Oh, no. Is everything okay?

16:10.359 --> 16:11.478
Girl...

16:11.480 --> 16:12.879
Oh, come here, sit down.

16:14.203 --> 16:16.083
I had to call the whole move off.

16:16.085 --> 16:18.442
It's a disaster.

16:18.444 --> 16:20.467
Everybody decided to show they ass.

16:20.469 --> 16:23.810
- What?
- From the kids to Josh to the movers.

16:23.812 --> 16:25.652
But I decided I'm not gonna cry anymore.

16:25.654 --> 16:27.134
- I'm tired of it.
- Oh, no.

16:27.136 --> 16:29.376
Okay? If I got to do this
whole thing on my own,

16:29.378 --> 16:31.178
then I'll do it on my own.

16:31.180 --> 16:33.099
Please don't tell me
you don't lost your mind

16:33.101 --> 16:35.182
before we start a whole damn company.

16:35.184 --> 16:37.504
Girl, moving is stressful.

16:37.506 --> 16:39.866
And change is hard.

16:39.868 --> 16:42.349
You start doing it on your
own, and I promise you,

16:42.351 --> 16:45.071
in six months, you'll be
looking like Lupita from "Us".

16:45.073 --> 16:46.833
Straight crazy.

16:46.835 --> 16:48.275
But it's the principle, though.

16:48.277 --> 16:50.297
- Mm-hmm.
- It's all congrats until

16:50.299 --> 16:51.979
they have to make a small sacrifice.

16:51.981 --> 16:53.040
Mm-hmm.

16:53.042 --> 16:54.762
Well, you know I got your back.

16:54.764 --> 16:57.644
And if you need more time
in New York, I understand.

16:57.646 --> 17:00.327
I'll get there early, and
I'll set everything up,

17:00.329 --> 17:03.010
and when you're ready to come, come.

17:03.012 --> 17:04.290
Thank you.

17:04.292 --> 17:06.053
Girl, you know I got your back.

17:06.055 --> 17:07.214
I know.

17:07.215 --> 17:08.295
You need some wine?

17:08.297 --> 17:09.777
- Hell yes.
- Come on.

17:09.779 --> 17:11.178
Let's get you some wine.

17:13.703 --> 17:15.782
No! 'Cause I don't know
which box to put it in!

17:15.785 --> 17:17.144
She gonna want it.

17:17.146 --> 17:18.809
Get your mind off her hair things.

18:00.170 --> 18:05.013
All the boxes are on the truck.

18:05.015 --> 18:09.220
Whoa.

18:12.422 --> 18:15.103
- Did good, Shay.
- Thank you.

18:15.105 --> 18:18.266
From the projects to Park
Slope to your own business.

18:18.268 --> 18:20.508
Girl, you got it going on.

18:20.510 --> 18:22.510
It feels like I got it going on.

18:22.512 --> 18:24.833
I know. Oh.

18:24.835 --> 18:26.194
Bought you something.

18:26.196 --> 18:28.196
Oh, you didn't have to do this, Tray.

18:30.320 --> 18:32.751
Remember the bracelet I
got you when we first met

18:32.753 --> 18:34.242
and you became my girl?

18:34.244 --> 18:36.925
Oh, my goodness. I sold
this years ago to...

18:36.927 --> 18:39.127
To feed the kids, I know.

18:39.129 --> 18:40.889
I bought you a new one.

18:40.891 --> 18:42.971
You may not be my girl no more, Shay,

18:42.973 --> 18:46.014
but you gave me two beautiful kids.

18:46.016 --> 18:47.295
And for that reason alone,

18:47.297 --> 18:49.057
you will always be my first and only...

18:49.059 --> 18:51.619
I know.

18:51.621 --> 18:53.261
I want to thank you, Tray.

18:53.263 --> 18:54.703
For what?

18:54.705 --> 18:57.225
I'm the worst thing that
happened in your life.

18:57.227 --> 19:00.468
I wouldn't change anything
that happened in my life.

19:00.470 --> 19:02.270
It made me who I am.

19:02.272 --> 19:04.312
It made you who you are.

19:04.314 --> 19:06.474
You were the only person
who believed in me

19:06.476 --> 19:09.197
as a designer when no one else did.

19:09.199 --> 19:11.781
Sometimes that's all you need
is someone to believe in you.

19:13.366 --> 19:15.871
I believe in you, Tray.

19:20.731 --> 19:22.771
I love you, Shay. Don't forget me.

19:22.773 --> 19:24.653
We just moving to Jersey.

19:24.655 --> 19:26.134
How could I forget you?

19:26.136 --> 19:27.696
I'm just going crazy right now.

19:27.698 --> 19:29.698
Just bugging out.

19:31.862 --> 19:33.782
Go tell the kids goodbye.

19:33.784 --> 19:35.343
I'll be down in a little bit.

19:35.345 --> 19:38.827
Bet.

19:38.829 --> 19:41.790
Tray...

19:41.792 --> 19:45.997
I love you, too.

19:49.880 --> 19:51.880
That boy is too sensitive.
