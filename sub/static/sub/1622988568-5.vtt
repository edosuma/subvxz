14:35.499 --> 14:42.506
I started in this business with a dream
that I could change the world with money.

14:43.591 --> 14:47.303
Instead, the money changed me.

14:48.053 --> 14:49.847
And I let that dream go.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.058
But the guy in that article?

14:54.810 --> 14:56.270
He still had that dream.

14:57.354 --> 14:59.148
And he was making it real.

15:00.691 --> 15:04.153
That was my first interview.
Might be my last.

15:04.236 --> 15:06.739
-That company still hasn't made a dime.
-Oh, they will.

15:06.822 --> 15:09.825
At least, they better.
I bought a thousand shares.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.327
[tender music playing]

15:12.244 --> 15:17.124
You're the reason I quit my job
and came here to do this kind of work.

15:18.042 --> 15:20.294
So... thanks.

15:21.545 --> 15:22.379
Yeah.

15:22.963 --> 15:27.426
I'll tee the partners up at dinner,
and tomorrow you seal the deal.

15:27.509 --> 15:28.344
[Cooper] Mmm.

15:28.427 --> 15:30.512
-They're gonna love you.
-Well, we'll see.

15:31.221 --> 15:32.056
Come on.

15:33.098 --> 15:35.684
What's not to love about Cooper Connelly?

15:47.196 --> 15:49.281
[keyboard clacking]

15:49.365 --> 15:53.369
[Billie] A suit of armor?
Made up of all the bad stuff Brad did?

15:54.954 --> 15:56.163
That should be easy.

15:59.208 --> 16:00.751
[speaking indistinctly]

16:03.170 --> 16:04.880
Some people hold grudges.

16:04.964 --> 16:09.259
It's a survival mechanism,
the only benefit to bad experience.

16:11.053 --> 16:14.223
But me? I forget all the bad stuff.

16:16.141 --> 16:17.309
Until I don't.

16:26.235 --> 16:28.153
-[elevator dings]
-[doors open]

16:30.280 --> 16:31.115
Hey.

16:41.166 --> 16:42.334
There you are.

16:42.418 --> 16:43.377
What's wrong?

16:47.381 --> 16:48.215
I'm late.

16:50.801 --> 16:51.844
For what?

17:05.733 --> 17:07.401
Well, have you taken it yet?

17:10.988 --> 17:12.072
I was too scared.

17:14.283 --> 17:15.409
Well, if you are...

17:20.789 --> 17:22.374
What are you gonna do about it?

17:28.213 --> 17:29.214
Oh, my God.

17:30.174 --> 17:31.008
Of course.

17:33.010 --> 17:34.678
-Of course.
-Of course, what?

17:38.390 --> 17:43.437
It's not just me, okay? It's us.

17:44.563 --> 17:47.066
What are we gonna do about it?

17:47.149 --> 17:49.193
Billie, come on.

17:50.319 --> 17:52.571
We don't want this.

17:53.822 --> 17:57.618
You've got at least two years left
on your PhD. You don't want this.

17:57.701 --> 17:59.495
[dramatic music playing]

17:59.578 --> 18:00.412
Okay.

18:01.830 --> 18:05.125
But what if I--? What if I do?

18:08.045 --> 18:08.879
Billie...

18:12.549 --> 18:13.383
No.

18:17.471 --> 18:19.973
If you didn't,
maybe you should have been more careful.

18:20.057 --> 18:21.058
Oh.

18:21.600 --> 18:25.604
-But you're never careful, about anything.
-What did you expect?

18:26.271 --> 18:28.732
You know about my family, all right?

18:28.816 --> 18:32.111
What makes you think I know
the first thing about being a father?

18:32.194 --> 18:35.989
-Of course I don't want it.
-Of course. Of course. Of course.

18:36.073 --> 18:37.783
-Billie, wait.
-Yeah. No.

18:39.284 --> 18:42.663
You know, you are doing exactly
what your stepdad said you would do.

18:42.746 --> 18:45.082
What you said
that you didn't wanna do with me.

18:45.165 --> 18:47.543
You are running
at the first sign of trouble.

18:47.626 --> 18:49.962
-I'm not running!
-Yes, you fucking are!

18:52.339 --> 18:53.173
[Cooper] Billie!

19:03.934 --> 19:04.852
Hi.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.736
We need to leave in ten minutes.

19:17.072 --> 19:17.906
Okay, sure.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.996
[indistinct chatter]

19:25.080 --> 19:27.708
Good evening.
Would you like to order drinks?

19:28.584 --> 19:32.421
Uh, no, thanks.
We're still waiting on our guests here.

19:33.046 --> 19:35.591
-Maybe just some water, please.
-Of course.

19:43.599 --> 19:46.185
Hudson's been doing so well at drop-off.

19:46.268 --> 19:49.688
I think he's really starting
to like school.

19:51.398 --> 19:52.441
Thank you.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.027
And, um...

19:56.528 --> 19:59.656
Miss Brenda said that he shared
his snack with Hannah today.

19:59.740 --> 20:01.283
[chuckles] He-- Thank you.

20:01.366 --> 20:04.745
He might have a little crush on her.
At least he's got good taste in girls.

20:04.828 --> 20:07.080
Billie, please. Just stop.

20:07.164 --> 20:09.166
[clears throat] You're trying
to make this normal,

20:09.249 --> 20:11.210
and nothing about this is normal.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.420
[cell phone buzzing]

20:18.175 --> 20:22.221
Francesca, hey.
Listen, how's it going with the partners?

20:22.304 --> 20:27.559
Hey, where are you?
Can you get back into the city, like, now?

20:27.643 --> 20:29.937
-Um...
-[clears throat]

20:30.938 --> 20:35.525
I'm just at a dinner right now.
What's going on? I can come in afterwards.

20:35.609 --> 20:37.402
I've been talking you up all night,

20:37.486 --> 20:41.156
and now everyone wants
to hear from the genius himself.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.824
[chuckles] You're kidding me.

20:42.908 --> 20:46.870
I'm doing my best, but I can't rattle off
the impressive details like you can.

20:46.954 --> 20:47.955
Oh, well...

20:48.455 --> 20:52.167
Plus, face time with the brass
could be great exposure for you.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.085
What do you say?

20:53.669 --> 20:57.089
Yeah. Absolutely.
I'll get there as soon as I can.

20:57.589 --> 21:00.092
-Great. See you soon.
-All right? See you.

21:03.220 --> 21:04.263
[clears throat]

21:05.055 --> 21:08.058
You're going into the city? Tonight?

21:09.893 --> 21:10.727
They're here.

21:13.522 --> 21:15.107
[dramatic music playing]

21:27.953 --> 21:28.787
[moaning]

21:34.084 --> 21:36.503
-Hey, honey.
-Oh, hi.

21:37.838 --> 21:40.090
-You good?
-Yeah. Yes, I'm good.

21:40.173 --> 21:42.009
-Coop!
-My God, Billie.

21:42.509 --> 21:44.052
So great to see you again.

21:54.688 --> 21:58.525
-Um, this is my husband.
-Yeah, we've met.

21:59.693 --> 22:01.862
-Oh, right. That's right, yeah.
-Mm-hm.

22:02.487 --> 22:05.240
Okay. Um... Let's sit.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.491
-Yes?
-Yeah.

22:13.290 --> 22:15.459
Coop. I missed you, man.

22:16.877 --> 22:19.087
Me too, Sash. It's been way too long.

22:19.171 --> 22:21.089
Did you guys find your way okay?

22:21.173 --> 22:22.758
-Oh, yeah.
-[Brad] Super easy.

22:22.841 --> 22:27.054
We were on my bike,
so we just slipped in and out of traffic.

22:30.098 --> 22:32.851
Sasha's always had a thing
for motorcycles.

22:32.934 --> 22:35.103
You know me. I love danger.

22:35.854 --> 22:38.482
We appreciate
you guys making the trip out.

22:38.565 --> 22:41.610
It's funny,
I never pictured you in the suburbs...

22:43.862 --> 22:44.821
but seeing it now...

22:47.824 --> 22:50.243
I really do love it here.

22:50.327 --> 22:54.164
Yeah, it was actually Billie's idea
to move out here full-time.

22:54.247 --> 22:55.749
[Billie] Yeah, it's just so...

22:56.958 --> 22:57.834
green.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.212
I missed that.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.006
And peaceful.

23:03.090 --> 23:06.635
It's definitely much simpler
than the city.

23:06.718 --> 23:08.929
Spoken like someone
who's only ever lived there.

23:10.430 --> 23:15.852
Anyway, I was telling Cooper
how you two met up in Paris last year.

23:15.936 --> 23:20.107
Yes. It was quite a coincidence, actually.
I was at a conference.

23:20.190 --> 23:23.360
Brad happened to be touring
with one of his bands?

23:23.443 --> 23:27.739
We bumped into each other at Arpege,
which led to drinks at Bisou.

23:28.490 --> 23:33.703
Next thing I knew,
we were dancing till 5 a.m. at Chez Moune.

23:34.704 --> 23:38.375
One thing led to another, and here we are.

23:38.458 --> 23:42.963
I was at a stopover with Kicking Fire.
You remember them, Billie?

23:44.297 --> 23:46.049
Mm. Not really.

23:46.133 --> 23:46.967
What?

23:48.593 --> 23:50.095
You loved those guys.

23:50.178 --> 23:53.265
Said they were White Stripes
with a bit of Bowie.

23:53.348 --> 23:54.891
Mmm. I didn't wanna sign them,

23:54.975 --> 23:57.436
but Billie convinced me
they're the real deal.

23:57.519 --> 23:58.979
You know your wife.

23:59.855 --> 24:02.732
When she wants something,
she can be very persuasive.

24:05.735 --> 24:09.823
So you two, you've been together
for over a year, then?

24:09.906 --> 24:10.866
-Mm.
-Mm.

24:11.408 --> 24:13.535
That doesn't feel awkward to you?

24:14.286 --> 24:18.874
I mean, you dated my wife, and then...
Now you're dating her best friend.

24:18.957 --> 24:21.585
Cooper, I told you, I'm fine with it.

24:21.668 --> 24:25.172
I mean, I've dated everyone else
in New York, why not Brad?

24:25.672 --> 24:28.175
Yeah, and besides,
there's a lot of history between us.

24:28.758 --> 24:31.136
We're all really connected.

24:31.219 --> 24:33.472
You're not that connected. You're not.

24:33.555 --> 24:38.101
I mean, maybe you and Sasha.
Certainly Billie and Sasha.

24:39.186 --> 24:43.106
-Billie never even mentioned you.
-Maybe there's a reason for that.

24:44.566 --> 24:47.068
Uh, maybe we should get some drinks.

24:47.152 --> 24:49.154
Yes! Alcohol. Please.

24:49.237 --> 24:51.072
Hi. Hi. Hi.

24:51.156 --> 24:54.826
Um, can we order some drinks, like, now?

24:54.910 --> 24:58.705
-Certainly. What can I get you?
-A very strong vodka martini.

24:58.788 --> 25:01.666
Uh, Manhattan for me. Obviously.

25:02.375 --> 25:04.211
[Cooper] A Macallan, straight.

25:04.294 --> 25:07.214
And she'll have
a glass of the Opus One cab.

25:08.632 --> 25:10.091
No more Jack and Coke?

25:11.426 --> 25:13.261
Not much of a whiskey drinker anymore.

25:13.762 --> 25:16.306
Yeah, she's classed it up a bit
in the last eight years.

25:17.557 --> 25:20.393
So, uh, Cooper,
I understand you're a banker.

25:20.936 --> 25:23.146
Mm. Sounds fun.

25:24.648 --> 25:29.986
Yes. Yes, Cooper is making
a lot of headway in the VC world.

25:30.070 --> 25:33.114
Honey, um, you should tell them
about the energy deal

25:33.198 --> 25:35.158
you've been working on in San Francisco.

25:35.742 --> 25:38.995
Oh, babe, that deal closed six months ago.

25:41.122 --> 25:42.874
[Billie] Oh. [chuckles]

25:42.958 --> 25:44.793
Right. Okay.

25:45.669 --> 25:49.422
You know, there's just so many deals,
it's hard to keep up.

25:49.506 --> 25:51.091
[Cooper] And Billie's been so busy.

25:51.174 --> 25:54.678
I mean, the baby, you know, our second,

25:55.262 --> 25:58.139
and all the changes at work
with the expansion.

25:58.223 --> 26:00.892
Yeah, Billie was telling me about that.
How's it all going?

26:00.976 --> 26:04.896
Great. I have a pitch tomorrow.
We're trying to buy Nanogenics.

26:05.480 --> 26:08.608
It's a revolutionary development
in the way we treat cancer,

26:08.692 --> 26:11.945
so I'll be asking the partners
to invest $70 million

26:12.028 --> 26:14.614
so that we can save countless lives.

26:14.698 --> 26:17.701
Coop, that's amazing.

26:17.784 --> 26:22.497
Thank you. I mean, it might not be
as fun as running a record label,

26:22.581 --> 26:27.377
but, uh, I don't know,
some people seem to think it's important.

26:28.628 --> 26:32.132
Absolutely. Thank God for guys like you.

26:34.050 --> 26:35.135
Amen.

26:35.218 --> 26:36.803
-[waiter] Here we are.
-[Billie] Oh!

26:38.680 --> 26:41.683
-And, uh, ahem, what about you, Billie?
-Yes!

26:42.350 --> 26:43.226
How's work?

26:44.185 --> 26:47.480
I guess it's, uh, Dr. Billie now, huh?

26:48.857 --> 26:53.111
Actually, ahem, Sasha didn't tell you?

26:53.695 --> 26:57.782
I, um... I stopped out of my PhD program.

26:59.534 --> 27:00.368
Temporarily.

27:00.869 --> 27:02.120
Are you serious?

27:02.954 --> 27:06.041
But that program was everything to you.

27:07.000 --> 27:11.546
My priorities changed when I got pregnant.
I wanted to stay closer to home,

27:11.630 --> 27:15.800
so I started working
as a school psychologist instead.

27:16.635 --> 27:18.887
Billie's changed
so many of the students' lives.

27:18.970 --> 27:20.764
-They love her there.
-I'm sure they do.

27:20.847 --> 27:23.141
And you love it too, Billie?

27:23.224 --> 27:25.310
I do. Yes.

27:26.394 --> 27:31.191
But I'm taking a little time off
from everything right now.

27:31.274 --> 27:33.068
Just to be with my kids.

27:33.151 --> 27:34.444
So you're a full-time mom.

27:34.527 --> 27:36.988
-Brad.
-It's the most important job in the world.

27:37.072 --> 27:39.032
I'm planning on getting back to it.

27:40.617 --> 27:41.618
To all of it.

27:41.701 --> 27:45.121
Well, hold on. Only if you want to, babe.

27:45.205 --> 27:47.957
Billie is such an amazing mother.
The kids are thriving--

27:48.041 --> 27:51.586
I'll bet. I just know
how important your work was to you.

27:51.670 --> 27:57.133
You always said you wanted a big life.
That's the whole reason you left Georgia.

27:57.217 --> 27:58.760
Well, this isn't Georgia.

28:00.345 --> 28:02.013
-Trust me.
-[Brad] Of course not.

28:02.514 --> 28:04.349
As long as you're happy, B.

28:07.143 --> 28:09.145
That's all I want. Truly.

28:10.271 --> 28:11.272
I am.

28:15.276 --> 28:16.152
I am...

28:18.363 --> 28:20.031
really, really happy.

28:20.573 --> 28:22.534
Good. I'm glad.

28:24.077 --> 28:26.371
[dramatic music playing]

28:30.417 --> 28:35.505
I guess I'm just trying to wrap
my head around this whole new you.

28:35.588 --> 28:39.676
I mean, you're the girl
who used to start her night at 2 a.m.

28:41.428 --> 28:46.349
Dance on the bar at Tortilla Flats,
run wild around the beaches of Costa Rica.

28:46.433 --> 28:49.811
Okay. Okay.
What the hell are you doing, man?

28:49.894 --> 28:52.188
Billie and I spent a week in Tamarindo.

28:52.272 --> 28:55.942
Living off papayas and tequila,
swimming in the ocean,

28:56.985 --> 28:59.487
feeling the sting of the surf on our skin,

28:59.988 --> 29:03.324
that warm Caribbean breeze
through our hair.

29:10.498 --> 29:13.752
It was so hot, 102 in the shade.

29:14.377 --> 29:19.215
