WEBVTT

00:02.832 --> 00:04.199
Do you want Adrian
to have the baby?

00:04.200 --> 00:05.667
What are we gonna do
with a baby?

00:05.668 --> 00:07.535
I'm okay with
whatever you wanna do.

00:07.536 --> 00:10.271
- I don't wanna have a baby.
- You don't have to.

00:10.272 --> 00:12.207
I don't want you and Ricky
to be anywhere near each other.

00:12.208 --> 00:14.242
I see the way he looks at you,
and I see the way you look at him.

00:14.243 --> 00:17.746
I am not interested
in you living at our house.
But you find a place to live.

00:17.747 --> 00:19.914
No one's gonna get in the way
of my life with Amy and John.

00:19.915 --> 00:22.851
- Unless Adrian has your baby.
- I am... mov-ing.

00:22.852 --> 00:25.019
- Where you moving?
- Maybe the guest house.

00:25.020 --> 00:28.757
If you're too scared
to stay out there by yourself,
maybe I could crash with you.

00:28.758 --> 00:30.759
Deep down, you have
a really big heart

00:30.760 --> 00:32.560
and a good conscience,
and you wanna do
the right thing.

00:32.561 --> 00:34.162
Is it right to bring a baby
into the world

00:34.163 --> 00:36.598
when I don't want that baby
and Ben doesn't want that baby?

00:36.599 --> 00:38.366
You're the one who suggested
I go out and have

00:38.367 --> 00:40.401
indiscriminate,
meaningless sex.

00:40.402 --> 00:43.438
You didn't have to
if you didn't want to.
You're jealous.

00:43.439 --> 00:45.573
I can't believe I have
my own apartment in New York.

00:45.574 --> 00:47.175
Don't forget,
it's a four-week life.

00:47.176 --> 00:48.610
We'll need you back here
after four weeks.

00:48.611 --> 00:50.111
You're my daughter,

00:50.112 --> 00:51.946
and I don't want you
to terminate the pregnancy.

00:51.947 --> 00:53.448
You can't decide that.

00:53.449 --> 00:55.583
Then maybe we really
shouldn't be a family.

00:55.584 --> 00:58.419
I want to take care of you.

00:58.420 --> 00:59.921
Will you marry me?

01:05.561 --> 01:07.495
[ringing]

01:09.965 --> 01:11.800
[beeps]
Hello.

01:11.801 --> 01:14.135
<i>Dad, it's me.
What's up? It's Amy.</i>

01:14.136 --> 01:15.637
What's wrong?

01:15.638 --> 01:17.739
Amy, what time is it?

01:17.740 --> 01:19.607
Uh, it's 7 here.

01:19.608 --> 01:21.242
Amy, it's 4:00 in the morning.

01:21.243 --> 01:23.411
I know, but I don't know
how to get to where I'm going.

01:23.412 --> 01:24.579
Get a taxi.

01:24.580 --> 01:25.914
I don't think
we're supposed to do that.

01:25.915 --> 01:27.248
The instructions say
to take a subway,

01:27.249 --> 01:29.284
but I don't know
where I can find a subway.

01:29.285 --> 01:30.785
Oh, I'm sure you can find it,

01:30.786 --> 01:32.954
but you need to leave
your apartment and go outside.

01:32.955 --> 01:34.656
I know.

01:34.657 --> 01:36.958
But it's so nice in here.
[laughs]

01:36.959 --> 01:38.293
Did I tell you
I have a kitchen?

01:38.294 --> 01:39.961
Your dad told me.

01:39.962 --> 01:41.930
Do you need to be somewhere
at a certain time, Amy?

01:41.931 --> 01:44.098
I just have to register today.

01:44.099 --> 01:45.767
How do I pay for the subway?

01:45.768 --> 01:46.968
You buy a MetroCard.

01:46.969 --> 01:48.136
Where do I buy that?

01:48.137 --> 01:50.872
Amy, we went over all this
before you left.

01:50.873 --> 01:53.141
You buy MetroCards
in the subway station.

01:53.142 --> 01:54.642
Do you have your map?

01:54.643 --> 01:56.744
The subway stations
are marked on the map.

01:56.745 --> 01:59.414
It's really easy to find
your way around there.
It's on a grid.

01:59.415 --> 02:02.717
All right.
Well, wish me luck.

02:02.718 --> 02:04.652
Good luck, Amy.

02:04.653 --> 02:06.454
Are you okay?

02:06.455 --> 02:09.757
I guess. I mean,
I love my apartment.

02:09.758 --> 02:12.594
Dorm room.
Your dad wants you
to call it a dorm room,

02:12.595 --> 02:13.928
so call it that.

02:13.929 --> 02:15.930
He'll sleep a lot easier

02:15.931 --> 02:17.599
and so will I,

02:17.600 --> 02:19.901
especially if you don't call
at 4 in the morning, okay?

02:19.902 --> 02:22.303
All right.
Have a nice day.

02:22.304 --> 02:23.638
You, too, Amy.

02:23.639 --> 02:25.840
You have a good
first day in New York.

02:25.841 --> 02:27.442
And you'll be fine.

02:27.443 --> 02:28.943
New Yorkers are really friendly,

02:28.944 --> 02:30.945
and they're used
to seeing people lost.

02:30.946 --> 02:32.280
They'll help you
if you need help.

02:32.281 --> 02:34.115
You can help yourself
just by looking at a map.

02:34.116 --> 02:35.950
All right.
Bye, Mom.

02:35.951 --> 02:37.919
Bye, honey.

02:37.920 --> 02:39.020
[beeps]

02:40.623 --> 02:42.290
I should've gone with her.

02:42.291 --> 02:44.792
I would've gone with her
if I'd known she was
getting an apartment.

02:44.793 --> 02:46.594
Well, I'm wide awake now.

02:46.595 --> 02:48.196
Me, too.

02:53.435 --> 02:54.369

03:20.651 --> 03:23.553
I've heard Amy Juergens
play the French horn.

03:23.554 --> 03:26.256
She's good,
but she's not that good.

03:26.257 --> 03:28.291
She's first chair,
and she's a sophomore.

03:28.292 --> 03:30.593
Have you heard
the second and third chair?

03:30.594 --> 03:32.395
Of course
she's a first chair.

03:32.396 --> 03:33.897
So what are you
getting at?

03:33.898 --> 03:35.498
I'll tell you
what I'm getting at.

03:35.499 --> 03:38.168
There are two weeks
of school left,
and she's not here.

03:38.169 --> 03:40.570
You know why?
She's already showing.

03:42.039 --> 03:43.039
Showing what?

03:43.040 --> 03:46.609
Hello! She's pregnant,
again.

03:47.678 --> 03:49.179
Uh, you better shut up.

03:49.180 --> 03:51.081
Amy Juergens is not
pregnant again.

03:51.082 --> 03:53.183
What'd I tell you?
Covering.

03:53.184 --> 03:54.951
Now we know she's pregnant.

03:58.322 --> 04:00.790
Hey, so it's all over school.

04:00.791 --> 04:03.426
Juergens is pregnant again.

04:03.427 --> 04:04.894
I need a confirmation.

04:04.895 --> 04:07.430
Amy Juergens
is not pregnant again.

04:07.431 --> 04:10.366
She's in New York
at a music program
for great musicians.

04:10.367 --> 04:12.035
Because she is
a great musician.

04:12.036 --> 04:14.537
Oh, I see. Oh, hey, hey.
What are the stats

04:14.538 --> 04:16.873
on teen mothers getting pregnant
a second time?

04:16.874 --> 04:18.975
1 in 4 teenage mothers
has a second child

04:18.976 --> 04:20.476
within two years
of having their first.

04:20.478 --> 04:23.947
Why?
I have to make the odds.

04:23.948 --> 04:26.182
Who is pregnant again?
Amy.

04:26.183 --> 04:27.517
Only she's not.

04:27.518 --> 04:29.018
I thought she went
to New York.

04:29.019 --> 04:31.688
She did go to New York.
Ben took her to the airport yesterday.

04:31.689 --> 04:34.357
Yeah. She's in New York.
Yeah, she is.

04:34.358 --> 04:35.558
But she's not pregnant,
is she?

04:35.559 --> 04:37.393
No, she is not,

04:37.394 --> 04:39.829
I don't think.
She's not.

04:39.830 --> 04:42.832
Maybe she didn't tell you
because you told everyone
last time.

04:42.833 --> 04:45.735
This time, I didn't say anything
because there's nothing to say.

04:45.736 --> 04:47.070
She is at a music program.

04:47.071 --> 04:48.371
So she's not
pregnant again?

04:48.372 --> 04:49.372
No.

04:49.373 --> 04:50.740
No one's pregnant again.

04:50.741 --> 04:53.576
Is there anyone pregnant
for the first time?

04:53.577 --> 04:55.745
I don't think so.
Like who?

04:55.746 --> 04:56.813
No one.
No one.

04:59.116 --> 05:01.117
Are we going out
for breakfast every morning?

05:01.118 --> 05:03.119
No, because I don't think
we'll be leaving for school

05:03.120 --> 05:05.121
an hour early
every morning.

05:05.122 --> 05:08.124
Well, I told you it wouldn't
take an hour to drop off John.

05:08.125 --> 05:10.927
I mean, Amy practically
throws him from the car

05:10.928 --> 05:13.930
and then speeds away.
She does not.

05:13.931 --> 05:15.498
Well, I'm not gonna do that.

05:15.499 --> 05:17.033
I'm gonna go in
every morning.

05:17.034 --> 05:18.701
I wanna make sure
he's okay first

05:18.702 --> 05:20.770
before I just walk off
and leave him with strangers.

05:20.771 --> 05:23.373
Those strangers are his family
during school hours,

05:23.374 --> 05:25.308
and he's always okay.

05:25.309 --> 05:27.243
John loves those two
nursery ladies

05:27.244 --> 05:29.612
more than he loves Amy
or you or me.

05:29.613 --> 05:31.514
No, he doesn't.
Yeah, he does.

05:31.515 --> 05:33.550
Would you stop?
Be nice.

05:33.551 --> 05:36.085
Amy's a good mother.
She's made him feel
really secure,

05:36.086 --> 05:38.621
and that's why John is happy,
no matter who he's with.

05:38.622 --> 05:40.924
Amy Juergens
is pregnant again?

05:40.925 --> 05:42.425
Hey, you, what did
you just say?

05:42.426 --> 05:44.627
[clears throat]

05:44.628 --> 05:47.630
Did you just say Amy Juergens
is pregnant again?

05:47.631 --> 05:49.632
I didn't say it,
but other people are saying it.

05:49.633 --> 05:52.035
Everyone knows it.
It's all over school.

05:55.139 --> 05:56.906
Why do people think
that Amy's pregnant?

05:56.907 --> 06:00.109
Because she's not here.
One quarter of all
high school students

06:00.110 --> 06:01.811
who have babies have another
within two years.

06:01.812 --> 06:02.979
So what?

06:02.980 --> 06:05.582
So it makes sense.
Think about it.

06:05.583 --> 06:07.584
We only have a couple
of weeks of school left,

06:07.585 --> 06:09.586
and Amy just
blasted outta here.

06:09.587 --> 06:11.354
Why would she do that
if she's not pregnant?

06:11.355 --> 06:14.290
She's at a music program
that could help get her
into Juilliard.

06:14.291 --> 06:16.226
When my aunt was in high school,

06:16.227 --> 06:18.294
she got into a music program,

06:18.295 --> 06:22.365
and, uh, she stayed there
for...nine months.

06:25.569 --> 06:27.003
This is crazy.

06:28.672 --> 06:31.341
Wait.

06:31.342 --> 06:34.110
You don't think that Amy's
pregnant again, do you?

06:34.111 --> 06:36.012
No, Ashley, I don't.

06:36.013 --> 06:38.882
Well, I hope not.
There's no more room at the inn.

06:38.883 --> 06:41.351
I'll see you at home.
Bye.

06:46.323 --> 06:48.858
Hi. How are you?

06:48.859 --> 06:51.194
I'm annoyed.
That's how I am.

06:51.195 --> 06:54.030
Who started the rumor
that Amy's pregnant again?

06:54.031 --> 06:56.332
She's not.
Oh, thank God.

06:56.333 --> 06:59.002
Can you imagine
if there was two of them?

06:59.003 --> 07:01.004
I mean, two babies

07:01.005 --> 07:02.972
from the same mother-- Amy.

07:02.973 --> 07:04.474
That would be really bad.

07:04.475 --> 07:07.176
Yeah. It would.
See you, Grace.
Wait.

07:07.177 --> 07:09.879
Just because you and Adrian
aren't talking doesn't mean
we can't be friends.

07:09.880 --> 07:10.813
Yes, it does.

this conversation again
if you wanna be friends.

07:26.397 --> 07:28.197
I wanna be friends.
I really do.

Cute boots.

07:33.203 --> 07:34.871
Did you hear
Amy's pregnant again?

07:34.872 --> 07:37.907
Did I hear? Yeah, I heard.
It's all over school.

07:37.908 --> 07:40.143
But better her than me,
so remember--

07:40.144 --> 07:43.212
I know, I know.
Ix-nay on the etus-fay.

07:43.213 --> 07:44.948
Bye.

07:47.885 --> 07:49.986
Stop that.
Stop what?

07:49.987 --> 07:52.121
Looking at me like that.

07:53.390 --> 07:55.892
Did you hear that
Amy's pregnant again?

07:55.893 --> 07:58.061
Yeah, I  know.
Isn't that ridiculous?

07:58.062 --> 07:59.228
Yeah, it is.

07:59.229 --> 08:01.698
[scoffs]

08:01.699 --> 08:03.066
We need to talk.

08:04.735 --> 08:07.070
I said stop looking
at me like that.

08:07.071 --> 08:09.172
You wanna meet me after school,
or do you wanna go
someplace now?

08:09.173 --> 08:11.107
Someplace now.

08:13.510 --> 08:14.444
Pappas.

08:16.080 --> 08:17.613
Yeah, Coach?

08:17.614 --> 08:19.916
Amy Juergens
is pregnant again?

08:19.917 --> 08:22.719
I don't think so.
I think she's really at
a music program in New York.

08:22.720 --> 08:24.787
Amy Juergens really got into

08:24.788 --> 08:27.557
a national program
for musicians?

08:27.558 --> 08:29.492
Yeah.
Huh.

08:29.493 --> 08:32.895
I guess talent
really is subjective.
I guess so.

08:32.895 --> 08:34.931
You find a place to live yet?
Matter of fact, I did.

08:34.932 --> 08:36.566
Great.

08:36.567 --> 08:38.001
Oh. Excuse me.

08:39.436 --> 08:41.371
So you found
a place to live?

08:41.371 --> 08:42.871
Kind of.
Where?

08:42.873 --> 08:44.374
A buddy's house.
You have a buddy?

08:44.375 --> 08:46.642
I have lots of buddies.
Since when?

08:46.643 --> 08:48.578
I'm on the football team.
I got friends.

08:48.579 --> 08:50.947
You have teammates.
Whatever.

08:50.948 --> 08:53.116
That's not what I wanted
to talk to you about.

08:53.117 --> 08:56.119
Do you remember the other night
when we had that conversation
about Adrian?

08:56.120 --> 08:58.755
The one where we agreed
not to talk about
Adrian anymore?

08:58.756 --> 09:01.457
Yes. But we have to talk
about her, and to her.

09:01.458 --> 09:03.593
We don't have to try
to convince her
not to do anything.

09:03.594 --> 09:06.596
We just need to tell her
that we care about her
and the baby.

09:06.597 --> 09:08.264
We said we weren't
gonna do that.

09:08.265 --> 09:10.433
You and I both said
we weren't gonna do that.

09:10.434 --> 09:12.769
We said we were gonna
stay out of it,
and I'm gonna stay out of it.

09:12.770 --> 09:15.004
No, I know I said that,
but that was before

09:15.005 --> 09:17.006
when I thought I could buy into
the whe idea--

09:17.007 --> 09:19.409
like, it's not always wrong,
it's an individual decision.

09:19.410 --> 09:22.078
But I can't do it.
When it comes
to moral issues, Grace,

09:22.079 --> 09:24.247
you never seem to be able
to make up your mind.

09:24.248 --> 09:25.782
You know, like with sex.

09:25.783 --> 09:28.117
I know. But if we don't
talk to her--

09:28.118 --> 09:31.754
Even if we talk to her,
it's still her decision
and none of our business.

09:42.466 --> 09:45.234
Tomorrow.
And it's not a consultation.

09:45.235 --> 09:47.437
I've already had
the consultation.

09:49.273 --> 09:52.031
Tomorrow I'm going
to have the abortion.

10:00.436 --> 10:02.971
<i>You know, you still haven't
been for a ride in my car.</i>

10:02.972 --> 10:04.906
Wanna go for a ride
in my car?

10:04.907 --> 10:06.374
I don't think so, Grace.

10:06.375 --> 10:08.610
It feels like I've been
at school for about 36 hours,

10:08.611 --> 10:10.278
and I just wanna go home.

10:10.279 --> 10:12.113
I'll see you Monday.
We can hang out tomorrow.

10:12.114 --> 10:14.782
No, I have something
I have to do with my mother.

10:14.783 --> 10:18.753
You know, Amy's not at work,
and they can probably use
some help in the nursery.

10:18.754 --> 10:21.122
Maybe the two of us could
go over there and help out.

10:21.123 --> 10:23.191
I mean, we did talk Amy
into keeping John,

10:23.192 --> 10:25.293
and we told her we'd help her,
and we haven't yet.

10:25.294 --> 10:27.362
So now's the perfect chance.

10:27.363 --> 10:29.931
Maybe the two of us could
go over there and volunteer
at the nursery this afternoon.

10:29.932 --> 10:31.799
What?

10:31.800 --> 10:34.469
[scoffs]

10:34.470 --> 10:36.638
I know what
a baby looks like.

10:36.639 --> 10:40.041
I don't need to see
a bunch of them
in the church nursery.

10:40.042 --> 10:42.210
I can't have
this baby, okay?

10:42.211 --> 10:44.112
I just can't, Grace.

10:44.113 --> 10:45.747
And this wasn't
an easy decision for me,

10:45.748 --> 10:48.616
but I've me the decision,
so leave me alone.

10:48.617 --> 10:50.218
Bye.

10:52.888 --> 10:56.758
All right, you two.
Let's just get our cards
out on the table.

10:56.759 --> 10:58.927
We know that Adrian
is pregnant.

10:58.928 --> 11:01.196
Okay.
So she's pregnant.

11:01.197 --> 11:02.530
[together]
Oh, no!

11:02.531 --> 11:04.299
I told you.
I can't believe it.

11:04.300 --> 11:06.401
You tricked us.
Is she having the baby.

11:06.402 --> 11:07.468
We can't tell you that.

11:07.469 --> 11:08.469
You told us
the other part.

11:08.470 --> 11:10.638
No, we didn't.
No, we did.

11:10.639 --> 11:13.541
We just did.
Well, you did anyway.

11:13.542 --> 11:16.311
Oh, this can't be happening.
I promised Jack
I wouldn't say anything.

11:16.312 --> 11:19.047
I thought you knew,
I thought you knew,
I thought you knew.

11:19.048 --> 11:20.782
You should've known.
You're his best friends.

11:20.783 --> 11:23.351
I guess he considered it
private, personal business.

11:23.352 --> 11:24.619
She's not having
the baby, is she?

11:24.620 --> 11:26.421
[scoffs]
No.
Madison.

11:26.422 --> 11:28.122
Well, if I told them
that she's having the baby,

11:28.123 --> 11:29.857
they'd be expecting her
to have the baby.

11:29.858 --> 11:31.926
All right. I'm cutting
everyone off right here,
right now.

11:31.927 --> 11:33.828
We're not talking
about this ever again.

11:35.631 --> 11:37.465
Oh, no. Poor Ben.

11:37.466 --> 11:39.400
Poor Ben?
Poor Adrian.

11:39.401 --> 11:42.170
Yeah, poor Adrian, too.
Poorer Adrian.

11:42.171 --> 11:43.638
Everyone
is poorer than Ben.

11:43.639 --> 11:44.939
You know what I mean.

11:44.940 --> 11:46.274
Yeah, I know
what you mean.

11:46.275 --> 11:47.775
And I know why
he didn't tell us,

11:47.776 --> 11:49.510
and I have to say
I completely understand,

11:49.511 --> 11:51.646
and I respect his decision
not to tell us.

11:51.647 --> 11:53.314
If something like that
ever happened to us,

11:53.315 --> 11:55.250
and I decided not to go through
with having the baby,

11:55.251 --> 11:57.018
I wouldn't want you
to tell Ben or anyone else.

11:57.019 --> 11:58.753
Two minutes ago,
you were asking.

11:58.754 --> 12:00.321
Two minutes ago,
you were all for finding out.

12:00.322 --> 12:01.823
Well, I made a mistake,
all right?

12:01.824 --> 12:03.691
I wanted to know,
and now I wish I didn't know.

12:03.692 --> 12:04.692
So what do we do?

12:04.693 --> 12:06.361
We stay out of it.

12:06.362 --> 12:08.596
If he wants to tell us,
he'll tell us, and we'll
be there for him.

12:08.597 --> 12:11.032
But if he doesn't wanna tell us,
we're never gonna bring
it up again.

12:11.033 --> 12:14.302
Not even between the two of us?
'Cause I may need to talk
about this, Alice.

12:14.303 --> 12:17.205
Why is that?
If this ever happened to you,
you'd tell me, right?

12:17.206 --> 12:18.840
Truthfully, I'm not sure.

12:18.841 --> 12:20.341
And don't take that
the wrong way.

12:20.342 --> 12:21.909
If you know,
you'd tell Ben,

12:21.910 --> 12:24.178
and he'd tell Grace,
and she'd tell Jack,

12:24.179 --> 12:26.080
and he'd tell Madison,

12:26.081 --> 12:28.182
and even though
she wouldn't mean to,
she'd tell everyone.

12:28.183 --> 12:30.551
Then we're just not going
to have sex again until
we're married.

12:32.955 --> 12:34.188
I would tell you,
all right?

12:34.189 --> 12:35.556
All right.

12:35.557 --> 12:37.592
Don't threaten me again,

12:37.593 --> 12:39.327
especially for
just being honest.

12:39.328 --> 12:41.496
And I'm being honest when
I tell you I'd want to know.

12:41.497 --> 12:44.666
Let's not get into any fights
about a hypothetical situation.

12:44.667 --> 12:46.801
Okay, but maybe we should

12:46.802 --> 12:49.170
talk about these hypothetical
situations some more.

12:49.171 --> 12:51.639
Odds are,
as careful as we are,
it's never gonna happen.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.608
If it does happen,

12:53.609 --> 12:55.576
I want you to have the baby,

12:55.577 --> 12:57.078
and I wanna get married.

13:00.049 --> 13:01.849
Let's just see
that it doesn't happen.

13:13.295 --> 13:16.297
I'm here for
a job interview.

13:16.298 --> 13:18.633
Yes. So am I.

13:18.634 --> 13:20.968
What kind of work
do you do?

13:20.969 --> 13:24.172
I was a vice president
of a company

13:24.173 --> 13:26.874
that was basically bribing
congressional members

13:26.875 --> 13:29.577
to vote in such a way that would
increase our profit margin.

13:29.578 --> 13:30.912
Interesting.

13:30.913 --> 13:32.714
Don't know what it means,

13:32.715 --> 13:35.183
but interesting.
[chuckles]

13:35.184 --> 13:38.820
I was there for 28 years
till a scandal shut down
the company,

13:38.821 --> 13:40.822
leaving me unemployed,

13:40.823 --> 13:43.458
which is basically
why my wife left me.

13:43.459 --> 13:44.659
Did you go to jail?

13:44.660 --> 13:46.661
No. No.

13:46.662 --> 13:49.964
I wasn't even
remotely involved.

13:49.965 --> 13:51.966
Maybe remotely.

13:51.967 --> 13:54.202
Uh, what, uh--
What job are you applying for?

13:54.203 --> 13:55.303
Mail room.

13:55.304 --> 13:57.872
Ah. Me, too.

13:57.873 --> 14:01.142
My girlfriend is pregnant.

14:01.143 --> 14:03.010
I need this job.

14:03.011 --> 14:05.413
So is mine.

14:06.849 --> 14:08.116
Look, kid,

14:08.117 --> 14:10.051
you're not gonna get
the sympathy vote from me, okay?

14:10.052 --> 14:12.086
'Cause I can match you
trouble for trouble.

14:12.087 --> 14:14.222
Then may the best man win.

14:14.223 --> 14:15.523
Let's go.

14:15.524 --> 14:16.958
Bring it on, dawg.

14:19.895 --> 14:21.629
I think I just need
to go home.

14:21.630 --> 14:23.831
My mind is really not
on my work today.

14:23.832 --> 14:26.968
You can't.
I've covered for you
enough lately.

14:26.969 --> 14:28.970
Besides, what are you
gonna do at home?

14:28.971 --> 14:30.705
There's nothing
you can do.

14:30.706 --> 14:34.809
I know, but...
I don't wanna be here.

14:34.810 --> 14:36.878
I don't wanna be at home.

14:36.879 --> 14:38.946
I don't know
what I want...

14:38.947 --> 14:41.382
other than for Amy
never to find out.

14:41.383 --> 14:42.917
Is that why you're
going along with this?

14:42.918 --> 14:44.919
Because you think you can
hide this from Amy?

14:44.920 --> 14:46.854
You can't hide this
from Amy.

14:46.855 --> 14:49.757
I mean, for all you know,
one day, when Adrian's temper
gets the best of her again,

14:49.758 --> 14:51.459
she'll tell Amy.

14:52.761 --> 14:55.096
Hey, if you're just
agreeing to an abortion

14:55.097 --> 14:58.566
because you don't want anyone
to ever find out Adrian
was pregnant,

14:58.567 --> 15:00.234
think again, my friend.

15:00.235 --> 15:02.703
It's not gonna happen.
I'm not agreeing
to anything,

15:02.704 --> 15:04.705
I don't think.

15:04.706 --> 15:08.109
But you're for abortion,
right?

15:08.110 --> 15:09.777
"For"?

15:09.778 --> 15:11.779
I'm not for abortion.

15:11.780 --> 15:13.781
But I'm not against abortion.

15:13.782 --> 15:15.650
And what I'm really for

15:15.651 --> 15:17.251
is the mom
and the dad deciding

15:17.252 --> 15:19.220
before the baby is born.

15:19.221 --> 15:22.824
It's better to decide
before you have the kid
than after.

15:22.825 --> 15:26.494
My parents pretty much decided
I shouldn't have been born
after I was born.

15:31.366 --> 15:34.469
Look, Ben, if you and Adrian
don't want Adrian to have
the baby

15:34.470 --> 15:36.704
because you don't want
Amy to find out,

15:36.705 --> 15:38.706
then that's probably
not a good reason,

15:38.707 --> 15:40.608
if you're looking
for a reason.

15:40.609 --> 15:42.610
We don't have a reason.

15:42.611 --> 15:44.111
We just don't want a baby.

15:44.112 --> 15:46.214
Neither of us wants a baby.

15:46.215 --> 15:48.316
But I don't know if Adrian
having an abortion

15:48.317 --> 15:49.984
is the right thing
or the wrong thing.

15:49.985 --> 15:52.053
I honestly don't.
Stop judging, okay?

15:52.054 --> 15:54.922
Just go with what is
and stop judging.

15:54.923 --> 15:57.425
You don't know if something bad
will come of this,

15:57.426 --> 16:00.228
or something good will come
of not going through
with the pregnancy.

16:00.229 --> 16:02.964
I mean, maybe it's a future
Mother Teresa that's not
gonna be born,

16:02.965 --> 16:06.334
or maybe it's a future Hitler
that's not gonna be born.

16:06.335 --> 16:08.102
No one knows.
You can't know.

16:08.103 --> 16:10.204
Well, what's
the right thing to do?

16:10.205 --> 16:12.306
Support her decision
not to have the baby,

16:12.307 --> 16:13.808
or try to talk her out of it?

16:13.809 --> 16:17.512
Try to live with
whatever decision she makes.

16:17.513 --> 16:19.113
All right?

16:19.114 --> 16:22.850
Whatever is, is,
and life goes on.

16:22.851 --> 16:25.520
Or it doesn't.

16:47.727 --> 16:49.728
Hey, let me help you with that.

16:49.729 --> 16:52.864
Big help.
I carry it from upstairs.

16:54.800 --> 16:56.835
I think we should just
tell your mom
I'm living out here

16:56.836 --> 16:58.903
in the guest house with you
until I find somewhere else.

16:58.904 --> 17:00.638
And that way,
I can help you out.

17:00.639 --> 17:03.008
That way,
she will get mad,

17:03.009 --> 17:07.378
and you will get kicked out
of here, buddy.

17:07.380 --> 17:10.080
Well, we're gonna have to
tell her I'm living out here
at some point.

17:10.082 --> 17:12.083
You can't hide me forever.
Too soon.

17:12.084 --> 17:15.286
My truck is parked
a block away in front
of someone else's house.

17:15.287 --> 17:17.821
What if I get towed?
Don't worry.

17:17.823 --> 17:20.525
I working at the courthouse.

17:20.526 --> 17:22.193
Did you get the job?
Is it definite?

17:22.194 --> 17:24.729
I just have to take a test.

17:24.730 --> 17:26.664
An easy one.

17:45.418 --> 17:47.218
[sniffs]

17:55.361 --> 17:57.695
Hey, I can do that.

17:57.696 --> 17:59.431
I just put
the boys to bed.

17:59.432 --> 18:02.000
I got it. You cooked.
I'm happy to clean up.

18:02.001 --> 18:03.334
No.
[chuckles]

18:03.335 --> 18:05.303
I really appreciate you
staying here.

18:05.304 --> 18:07.572
It's what Amy wants,
so I'm happy to do it.

18:07.573 --> 18:09.574
It's really nice of you.

18:09.575 --> 18:12.077
I really appreciate
you being here.

18:12.078 --> 18:14.813
I think getting away
for a few weeks is gonna be
really great for Amy.

18:14.814 --> 18:16.314
I didn't hear
from her today.

18:16.315 --> 18:18.316
I'm sure she's busy
with her first day of school

18:18.317 --> 18:20.752
and finding her way
around New York.

18:20.753 --> 18:23.455
I hope she's okay.
I'm sure she's fine.

18:23.456 --> 18:26.257
Who knows? This might lead
to her going to Juilliard

18:26.258 --> 18:28.126
or maybe playing
for the New York Philharmonic.

18:28.127 --> 18:29.627
I guess.

18:29.628 --> 18:31.629
It's good, right?

18:31.630 --> 18:34.966
You'd have to ask
a French horn player.
I just know sticks.

18:34.967 --> 18:37.435
I don't even know why
she picked the French horn
in the first place.

18:37.436 --> 18:38.670
I know.

18:38.671 --> 18:40.105
You know why she picked
the French horn?

18:40.106 --> 18:42.273
I hate to
bring up band camp,

18:42.274 --> 18:44.142
but she told me the story
at band camp.

18:44.143 --> 18:46.077
Well, John's over a year old.

18:46.078 --> 18:49.047
I think we've gotten past
any resentment from band camp.

18:50.416 --> 18:52.484
<i>It was Peter and the Wolf.</i>

18:52.485 --> 18:55.720
<i>You played
Peter and the Wolf to her
over and over again, right?</i>

18:55.721 --> 18:59.357
Yeah, I did.
The French horn plays
the part of the wolf.

18:59.358 --> 19:02.293
Yeah. She was scared
of the wolf.

19:02.294 --> 19:04.996
She thought
if she became the wolf,
she wouldn't be afraid anymore.

19:04.997 --> 19:06.297
She thought that
in the third grade?

19:06.298 --> 19:08.800
She thought that
in the third grade.

19:08.801 --> 19:10.802
And she thought that
you loved the wolf part

19:10.803 --> 19:12.904
<i>of Peter and the Wolf best.</i>

19:12.905 --> 19:14.839
And she just wanted
you to love her.

19:14.840 --> 19:17.842
But I do love her.
I've always loved her.

19:17.843 --> 19:20.578
She knows that.
Well, she knows that now.

19:29.788 --> 19:31.523
What are you eating?

19:31.524 --> 19:33.024
I'm not sure.

19:33.025 --> 19:36.361
Too frozen to tell,
but I think they're brownies.

19:36.362 --> 19:39.964
So, you eating brownies.

19:39.965 --> 19:44.002
I am doing
alt the heavy lifting.

19:44.003 --> 19:45.937
Give me one of those.

19:54.547 --> 19:56.581
Good, huh?
Mm-hmm.

19:56.582 --> 19:58.082
I just wanted to offer
to go with you.

19:58.083 --> 19:59.417
My mother's going with me.

19:59.418 --> 20:01.920
I could drive us.
Actually, you can't.

20:01.921 --> 20:03.755
You have
a provisional license.

20:03.756 --> 20:05.557
My driver could drive us.

20:05.558 --> 20:08.526
Um, all three of us--
or four, if my dad goes.

20:08.527 --> 20:10.595
Dads aren't going--
mine or yours.

20:10.596 --> 20:12.263
This is very private.

20:12.264 --> 20:14.098
And I would hate
for everyone

20:14.099 --> 20:17.101
to see your dad's car
and driver outside the clinic.

20:17.102 --> 20:20.271
But thanks, Ben.
Thanks for offering.

20:20.272 --> 20:22.273
Adrian, I don't know
what to do here.

20:22.274 --> 20:23.741
I wanna do something.

20:23.742 --> 20:25.510
There's nothing you can do

20:25.511 --> 20:29.180
except maybe be my friend.

20:29.181 --> 20:31.783
Maybe you can
come by on Sunday

20:31.784 --> 20:34.085
and we can just hang out
or something.

20:34.086 --> 20:36.287
I can't go with you?

20:36.288 --> 20:38.256
I mean, shouldn't I
be there with you?

20:38.257 --> 20:40.491
No, it's better if you're not.

20:40.492 --> 20:42.093
I'll talk to you Sunday, okay?

20:42.094 --> 20:44.629
Okay, Adrian.

20:44.630 --> 20:47.765
Um, I'm sorry.

20:47.766 --> 20:49.434
I know, Ben.

20:49.435 --> 20:51.302
Me, too. Good night.

20:51.303 --> 20:54.339
Good night.
[beeps]

20:55.441 --> 20:58.009
[Ruben]
No means no.
I said no.

20:58.010 --> 20:59.510
[Cindy]
You can say no all you want,

20:59.511 --> 21:01.179
but Adrian already
made her decision,

21:01.180 --> 21:03.114
and I'm supporting her.

21:03.115 --> 21:04.449
Well, I'm not.

21:04.450 --> 21:06.584
And I'm her father.
And I didn't come back

21:06.585 --> 21:08.987
into this family
to be excluded
and disrespected.

21:08.988 --> 21:11.356
This is not about you.
This is about Adrian.

21:11.357 --> 21:14.125
Of course it's about Adrian.
I love Adrian.

21:14.126 --> 21:15.593
And I don't want her
to do this.

21:15.594 --> 21:17.595
I think she'll regret this
for the rest of her life.

21:17.596 --> 21:19.097
This was not
an easy decision.

21:19.098 --> 21:22.100
It was not easy,
but it was made easier
because you agreed with her.

21:22.101 --> 21:24.769
That's not true.
I would support her decision
either way.

21:24.770 --> 21:25.970
Did you let her know that?

21:25.971 --> 21:28.706
Of course I did.

21:42.855 --> 21:42.920
What the heck
is going on next door?

21:44.923 --> 21:47.125
People are yelling.
People are saying things--

21:47.126 --> 21:49.160
things that I could hear.
Oh?

21:49.161 --> 21:51.996
Ashley, Adrian is pregnant,
isn't she?

21:51.997 --> 21:53.931
I don't know.

21:53.932 --> 21:55.667
Well, I don't know
if she's still pregnant.

21:55.668 --> 21:58.469
Oh, God.
Does Ben know?

21:58.470 --> 21:59.971
I don't think so.

21:59.972 --> 22:03.141
I don't think she wanted him
to know anything about it.

22:03.142 --> 22:04.976
But he might.

22:04.977 --> 22:06.444
He might?
He might.

22:06.445 --> 22:08.112
Did you know about this
when you encouraged

22:08.113 --> 22:11.149
your sister to go to New York?
I don't really know
anything about it.

22:11.150 --> 22:13.151
I don't wanna know
anything about it. It's--

22:13.152 --> 22:15.286
You know, it's none
of my business.

22:15.287 --> 22:17.455
It's no one's business.
No one's but Adrian's.

22:17.456 --> 22:19.857
This is not good.
Just forget you heard anything.

22:19.858 --> 22:21.859
How?
Okay, don't forget,

22:21.860 --> 22:24.629
but don't say anything
to Mom.

22:24.630 --> 22:27.498
You can't. We can't.
[sighs]

22:27.499 --> 22:29.534
We made a promise
that our lying days are over.

22:29.535 --> 22:31.269
You know, what good is it
gonna do to tell Mom

22:31.270 --> 22:33.871
that Adrian's having an abortion
or had an abortion?

22:33.872 --> 22:37.008
It's really not right
to talk about it at all.
To anyone.

22:37.009 --> 22:38.543
[knocks]

22:40.079 --> 22:43.081
Hi. Sorry to interrupt,
but the little fella's awake,

22:43.082 --> 22:45.783
and I think Mrs. Juergens
is in the shower
or something.

22:45.784 --> 22:47.985
Thanks, Ricky.
I'll take him.

22:47.986 --> 22:49.487
Hey, buddy.

22:49.488 --> 22:50.922
Whoa.

22:54.927 --> 22:56.661
[sighs]

23:01.533 --> 23:04.202
What's going on?
I don't know.

23:04.203 --> 23:05.203
Yeah, you do.

23:05.204 --> 23:07.238
Yeah, I do. Um...

23:07.239 --> 23:09.273
but I don't want
to talk about it.

23:09.274 --> 23:11.242
All right.

23:11.243 --> 23:13.578
Well, I guess
I'll just say good night.

23:16.014 --> 23:17.382
Should I say good night?

23:25.691 --> 23:27.191
Tell me what's wrong.

23:27.192 --> 23:29.494
Does it ever go right?

23:29.495 --> 23:31.696
Does the right girl
ever find the right guy?

23:31.697 --> 23:33.231
Sure.

23:35.634 --> 23:36.667
Sure?

23:36.668 --> 23:37.835
Yeah.

23:37.836 --> 23:39.737
Sure. It can happen.

23:43.008 --> 23:45.743
No, we can't.
We can't, Ashley.

23:45.744 --> 23:49.781
- We can if we want.
- No, we can't.

24:29.817 --> 24:31.351
Where is she?

24:31.352 --> 24:32.853
I don't know.

24:32.854 --> 24:34.221
She said she had to get out.

24:34.222 --> 24:35.856
She couldn't take us
arguing anymore.

24:35.857 --> 24:37.357
She'll be home tomorrow.

24:37.358 --> 24:38.892
Tomorrow!

24:38.893 --> 24:40.894
She's probably gonna try
and take care of this
on her own.

24:42.697 --> 24:44.698
This is your fault,
you know that?

24:44.699 --> 24:46.433
So you find her.

25:02.750 --> 25:04.784
[ringing]

25:06.988 --> 25:08.688
It's Grace.

25:08.689 --> 25:09.890
Hang up.

25:09.891 --> 25:11.358
I haven't answered yet.

25:11.359 --> 25:13.627
Answer it, then hang up.

25:15.897 --> 25:17.564
[beeps]
Hello.

25:17.565 --> 25:19.566
Hi.

25:19.567 --> 25:23.403
Hope I'm not bothering you.
Are you with Madison?

25:23.404 --> 25:25.338
Am I with Madison?

25:25.339 --> 25:27.274
No, I'm not with Madison.
Are you with Madison?

25:28.943 --> 25:30.877
No. Why would I ask you

25:30.878 --> 25:32.879
if you're with Madison
if I was with Madison?

25:32.880 --> 25:35.282
I don't know.

25:35.283 --> 25:37.217
I'm really worried
about Adrian,

25:37.218 --> 25:39.219
and I'm worried
that if I don't say something,

25:39.220 --> 25:41.721
I'm going to hell,
and you're going with me.

25:41.722 --> 25:42.956
All right.

25:42.957 --> 25:45.258
"All right"?
What is wrong with you?

25:45.259 --> 25:48.228
I'm not sure.
I'll call you back.

25:48.229 --> 25:49.162
[beeps]

25:55.403 --> 25:58.905
Tom, who was the last guest
to stay in this guest house?

25:58.906 --> 26:00.640
Gut house.

26:00.641 --> 26:02.142
Guest house.

26:02.143 --> 26:03.877
Guest of the guest house.
Guest of the guest house.

26:03.878 --> 26:05.879
Shoo, fly, shoo.

26:05.880 --> 26:07.447
Ow. My darlin'.

26:07.448 --> 26:09.783
[chuckling]

26:11.619 --> 26:13.586
Tom, I think we're high.

26:13.587 --> 26:15.555
I think these are
marijuana brownies.

26:15.556 --> 26:17.223
Better not be.

26:17.224 --> 26:22.262
I have a drug test
on Monday at the courthouse.

26:22.263 --> 26:25.532
That was the test--
the easy test?

26:25.533 --> 26:27.867
[sighs]
It's not gonna be
so easy anymore.

26:30.104 --> 26:33.239
I don't feel so well.

26:33.240 --> 26:36.810
I don't feel well either.

26:36.811 --> 26:38.812
Worst news for you,

26:38.813 --> 26:40.880
there's only one bathroom.

26:45.953 --> 26:47.053
[sighs]

26:49.957 --> 26:51.791
Where you going?

26:51.792 --> 26:53.126
To take Moose for a walk.

26:53.127 --> 26:54.461
He already had a walk.

26:54.462 --> 26:56.796
I think he needs
to go out again.
You sure?

26:56.797 --> 26:58.999
Well, not totally sure.

27:03.604 --> 27:05.705
Well, you could either
take Moose for a walk

27:05.706 --> 27:08.041
or we could just
go to bed.

27:09.143 --> 27:11.978
But we were in bed
just this morning.

27:11.979 --> 27:13.113
Uh-huh.

27:13.114 --> 27:14.514
It's either feast
or famine with you.

27:14.515 --> 27:16.883
Are you complaining?
No, no, no, no, no.
Not complaining.

27:18.519 --> 27:20.120
[beeping]

27:22.823 --> 27:24.424
[ringing]

27:27.528 --> 27:28.962
[beeps]

27:30.631 --> 27:32.232
[beeping]

27:33.300 --> 27:35.702
[ringing]
Hey, are you okay?

27:35.703 --> 27:37.237
It's not Adrian.

27:37.238 --> 27:39.539
It's me, Ruben.
Have you seen Adrian?

27:39.540 --> 27:41.608
What do you mean?
I mean, is she over there?

27:41.609 --> 27:43.143
No, she's not over here.

27:43.144 --> 27:45.278
You'd tell me if she
was over there, right?

27:45.279 --> 27:47.347
Even if she told you not to
tell me she was over there?

27:47.348 --> 27:49.149
She's not over here,
I swear.

27:49.150 --> 27:50.650
Okay.

27:50.651 --> 27:52.819
Well, if you see her,
tell her to call me.

27:52.820 --> 27:54.954
Or tell her
to call her mother.
All right.

27:56.023 --> 27:57.190
[beeps]

27:57.191 --> 27:58.658
[beeps]

28:01.462 --> 28:02.495
[beeping]

28:02.496 --> 28:04.364
[ringing]

28:05.966 --> 28:06.900
Hello?

28:08.502 --> 28:10.670
Adrian?
Um, no. It's just me.

28:10.671 --> 28:12.205
I was trying
to call Adrian.

28:12.206 --> 28:14.707
She left her phone at home.
I have her phone.

28:14.708 --> 28:17.744
Oh, right.
Um, well, that makes sense.

28:19.413 --> 28:22.916
Okay, well, um, I'm sorry.
I hope you find her.

28:22.917 --> 28:24.784
Me, too, Ashley.

28:24.785 --> 28:26.553
Good night.

28:26.554 --> 28:28.088
[beeps]

28:30.691 --> 28:32.525
inging]

28:34.195 --> 28:35.662
[beeps]
Hello?

28:35.663 --> 28:37.397
Oh. Hi, Grace.

28:37.398 --> 28:39.365
It's me, Ruben,
Adrian's dad.

28:39.366 --> 28:41.668
Is everything okay?
No, not really.

28:41.669 --> 28:44.337
Adrian left us a note
saying she'd be back tomorrow,

28:44.338 --> 28:46.272
and we don't know where she is.

28:46.273 --> 28:48.708
And we're really
worried about her.
Is she there?

28:48.709 --> 28:51.377
No. But maybe
she'll come here.

28:51.378 --> 28:54.047
And if she does come here,
I'll have her call you
right away. I promise.

28:54.048 --> 28:55.381
All right.

28:55.382 --> 28:57.917
Thanks, Grace.

28:57.918 --> 29:00.053
[beeps]

29:00.054 --> 29:02.288
[ringing]

29:02.289 --> 29:04.090
[beeps]

29:04.091 --> 29:07.393
She left her phone at home.
That's how I have your number.

29:07.394 --> 29:08.495
Okay. I'm sorry.

29:08.496 --> 29:10.396
That's okay. Good night.

29:10.397 --> 29:12.565
Good night.
[beeps]

29:15.870 --> 29:17.370
I need help.

29:17.371 --> 29:18.738
You haven't seen Adrian,
have you?

29:18.739 --> 29:20.073
No.

29:20.074 --> 29:22.041
I have a bad feeling
about this.

29:22.042 --> 29:24.511
I have bad stomach.

29:24.512 --> 29:27.447
Where's our new doctor dad?

29:27.448 --> 29:28.748
He and Mom
already went to bed.

29:28.749 --> 29:29.916
Of course.

29:29.917 --> 29:31.251
What's wrong
with your stomach?

29:31.252 --> 29:33.019
You're not a doctor.

29:33.020 --> 29:35.155
Don't try doctor me.

29:39.493 --> 29:42.128
[sniffs]
Ahh!

29:45.599 --> 29:48.635
[scoffs]
[door closes]

29:51.639 --> 29:53.740
I got cookies.

29:53.741 --> 29:55.408
Cookies?

29:55.409 --> 29:58.178
I got cookies.

29:58.179 --> 30:00.046
Who are you talking to?

30:02.650 --> 30:04.851
The gho-o-ost.

30:07.955 --> 30:09.889
Is that Jack's bag?

30:09.890 --> 30:11.624
That's Jack's gym bag,
isn't it?

30:11.625 --> 30:14.761
No-o-o-o-o.

30:14.762 --> 30:16.763
[phone ringing]
[Grace]
Is this where Jack is living?

30:16.764 --> 30:19.799
In the guest house with you?
He's not here.

30:19.800 --> 30:21.167
Are you sure about that?

30:21.168 --> 30:22.835
He gave me a ride.

30:22.836 --> 30:24.771
That his bag.

30:24.772 --> 30:27.373
He leave it here,
but he's not here.

30:28.809 --> 30:30.476
What's that?

30:30.477 --> 30:33.646
Brownies. Have one.
Trick or treat.

30:33.647 --> 30:36.015
What?
Go ahead.

30:36.016 --> 30:39.352
[sniffing]

30:39.353 --> 30:41.287
Where did you get these?

30:41.288 --> 30:43.223
The freezer.
Ohhh.

30:43.224 --> 30:45.725
I bet that homeless guy
left them here.

30:45.726 --> 30:48.027
Remember that homeless guy
that Dad used to let stay here?

30:48.028 --> 30:51.231
The one who was an alcoholic,
and he wouldn't go to AA
or anywhere else for help?

30:58.072 --> 31:00.006
It's actually
kind of nice in here.

31:00.007 --> 31:03.643
Why don't you sta-a-ay?

31:03.644 --> 31:05.945
Maybe I wi-i-ill.

31:05.946 --> 31:07.947
Maybe I'll just sleep here.

31:07.948 --> 31:09.949
I don't really feel
like being alone.

31:09.950 --> 31:11.918
And I can't quit thinking
about Adrian.

31:14.154 --> 31:16.089
Hey, can you
give me your phone?

31:17.491 --> 31:19.659
[beeping]

31:19.660 --> 31:21.094
[phone ringing]

31:22.162 --> 31:23.529
[beeps]
Tom?

31:23.530 --> 31:25.498
It's Grace.
Who's this?
Ruben.

31:25.499 --> 31:27.867
Oh. Right. Sorry.

31:27.868 --> 31:29.869
I thought Adrian might answer
if Tom called,

31:29.870 --> 31:31.537
so I called
using Tom's phone,

31:31.538 --> 31:34.741
but you have
Adrian's phone.

31:34.742 --> 31:38.911
I hate when other people
use other people's phones
to call.

31:38.912 --> 31:42.148
But anyway,
I've been praying about this--

31:42.149 --> 31:44.651
about Adrian--
and I have to believe

31:44.652 --> 31:46.653
that everything
will be fine.

31:46.654 --> 31:49.255
No matter where she is,
everything will be fine.

31:49.256 --> 31:53.259
It has to be, Mr. Ruben.

31:53.260 --> 31:54.394
Enriquez.

31:54.395 --> 31:56.296
And Enriquez to you.

31:56.297 --> 31:57.764
Good night.
[beeps]

31:59.867 --> 32:00.800
[beeps]

32:09.009 --> 32:11.944
Whose house is this?
Who is he cheating with?

32:11.945 --> 32:13.946
I don't know.
But it's curfew.

32:13.947 --> 32:15.948
We can't stay out here
all night.

32:15.949 --> 32:17.884
How could he
do this to me?

32:17.885 --> 32:19.252
Again, I don't know.

32:19.253 --> 32:21.921
I shouldn't have given him
the cow for free.

32:21.922 --> 32:25.291
I beg your pardon?
I thought he liked
getting the cow for free.

32:25.292 --> 32:27.560
Okay, snap out of it.
You're not a cow.

32:27.561 --> 32:29.595
You're a willing participant

32:29.596 --> 32:31.464
in whatever it is you're doing,

32:31.465 --> 32:33.499
and you are enjoying it
just as much as he is.

32:33.500 --> 32:35.735
He's obviously not
enjoying it as much as I am,

32:35.736 --> 32:38.604
or he wouldn't
be cheating on me.

32:38.605 --> 32:40.940
[sighs]

32:40.941 --> 32:42.709
[phone ringing]

32:47.981 --> 32:49.749
[beeps]
Hello?

32:49.750 --> 32:51.684
<i>Ruben?
Yeah?</i>

32:51.685 --> 32:53.586
Leo Boykewich.

32:53.587 --> 32:56.889
I just wanted to let you know
that Adrian's over here.

32:56.890 --> 32:59.559
I talked to her,
and I told her to call you,

32:59.560 --> 33:02.762
but I got a feeling
she's not going to.

33:02.763 --> 33:06.099
She left us a note that said
she'd be back in the morning.

33:06.100 --> 33:09.402
Cindy and I are fighting,
and she got upset.

33:09.403 --> 33:12.205
I don't want her
to have an abortion, Leo.

33:12.206 --> 33:14.974
I don't know
what you're thinking.

33:14.975 --> 33:17.577
I don't even care
what you're thinking,
or Cindy.

33:17.578 --> 33:20.346
I don't want her to do this.

33:20.347 --> 33:22.281
Can't you talk to Ben?

33:22.282 --> 33:24.650
Can't he talk her out of it?

33:24.651 --> 33:27.120
Wait. I forgot
who I'm talking to.

33:27.121 --> 33:30.089
Why would he talk her out of it?
He doesn't want that baby.

33:30.090 --> 33:31.891
It's not a matter
of what he wants,

33:31.892 --> 33:33.459
it's a matter
of what she wants.

33:33.460 --> 33:35.561
I know that's how
it should be.

33:35.562 --> 33:38.965
But, Leo, please.

33:38.966 --> 33:41.501
Do something.
Somebody do something.

33:41.502 --> 33:44.837
Look, I'll see to it she gets
back to you safely tomorrow,

33:44.838 --> 33:47.607
and that she goes from here
to there, all right?

33:47.608 --> 33:49.542
Unless you want her
to come home right now.

33:51.545 --> 33:54.781
Let her stay here.
e's with Ben.

33:54.782 --> 33:57.116
I think it's good for them
to have some time together.

33:57.117 --> 33:58.885
Haven't they spent
enough time together?

33:58.886 --> 34:01.421
Come on, Ruben.
She's fine here.

34:01.422 --> 34:04.457
All right.
I'm just happy she's safe.

34:04.458 --> 34:08.860
- Me, too. Good night.
- Thanks. Good night.

34:12.132 --> 34:14.500
What kind of a father am I?

35:15.130 --> 35:15.163
<i>âª You were a child âª</i>

35:17.032 --> 35:20.601
<i>âª Crawling on your knees
toward it âª</i>

35:22.504 --> 35:25.340
<i>âª Making Mama so proud âª</i>

35:26.475 --> 35:29.277
<i>âª But your voice is too loud âª</i>

35:32.614 --> 35:36.317
<i>âª We like to watch
you laughin' âª</i>

35:38.387 --> 35:41.756
<i>âª Pickin' insects off plants âª</i>

35:41.790 --> 35:45.326
<i>âª No time to think
of consequences âª</i>

35:46.528 --> 35:48.296
<i>âª Control yourself âª</i>

35:48.330 --> 35:51.733
<i>âª Take only
what you need from it âª</i>

35:54.203 --> 35:56.537
[knocking on door]

35:56.572 --> 35:57.705
Who is it?

35:57.740 --> 36:00.141
It's your buddy,
Bristol.
Who?

36:00.175 --> 36:02.043
We're on a buddy system here.
We're buddies.

36:02.077 --> 36:05.246
Open the door.
I don't know
anything about that.

36:05.280 --> 36:07.882
Are you Amy Juergens?
We have to get to class.

36:07.916 --> 36:10.385
You missed orientation
yesterday.

36:10.419 --> 36:11.586
Uh...

36:14.656 --> 36:16.224
I couldn't find the school.

36:16.258 --> 36:19.560
I came by yesterday morning
at 9 to go with you.
Oh, I was out by 7.

36:19.595 --> 36:22.163
I left you a note
on the door last night,
but I see it's still there.

36:22.197 --> 36:24.766
Yeah.
I went to bed early.

36:24.800 --> 36:26.467
I was lost all day.

36:26.502 --> 36:27.635
[chuckles]
Sorry.

36:27.669 --> 36:28.736
All right.

36:28.771 --> 36:30.671
Well, I'm just gonna
turn off my computer.

36:30.706 --> 36:33.341
I was just gonna send
something to my family.

36:33.375 --> 36:35.209
Do you have a son
or a daughter?

36:35.244 --> 36:37.812
I have a son.
Me, too.

36:40.382 --> 36:43.484
Um, how did you know
I had a baby?

36:43.519 --> 36:46.320
[chuckles]
And you have a son?

36:46.355 --> 36:48.322
We're all teen moms
and musicians.

36:48.357 --> 36:51.492
Everyone in this program?
The program--
it's for teen moms.

36:51.527 --> 36:54.095
So I didn't get here
on my own?

36:54.129 --> 36:55.930
Of course you did.

36:55.964 --> 36:59.634
You're the world's greatest
French horn player,
and I'm Yo-Yo Ma.

36:59.668 --> 37:01.135
Come on.
We have to get going.

37:06.508 --> 37:08.443
Bink.

37:09.344 --> 37:10.778
[sighs]

37:11.713 --> 37:13.514
You know what?

37:13.549 --> 37:15.917
[sighs]
It's too early to talk.

37:15.951 --> 37:20.154
Last night, Ricky told me
why Amy plays the French horn.

37:20.189 --> 37:22.690
<i>Because of Peter and the Wolf.</i>

37:22.724 --> 37:24.826
<i>Remember Peter and the Wolf?</i>

37:24.860 --> 37:27.395
Yeah, I remember.

37:27.429 --> 37:28.696
Kind of.

37:28.730 --> 37:31.466
Well, that's why Amy
picked the French horn.

37:31.500 --> 37:34.669
It's because she wanted
to get over being scared
of the wolf,

37:34.703 --> 37:37.171
and she wanted me
to love her.

37:37.206 --> 37:38.706
What time is it?

37:38.740 --> 37:40.141
George, are you listening?

37:40.175 --> 37:41.442
Yeah.

37:41.477 --> 37:44.378
I'm really happy that Ricky
decided to stay here.

37:44.413 --> 37:47.048
It'll give us a chance
to get to know him better.

37:47.082 --> 37:49.484
I think he might be
a nice guy after all.

37:50.886 --> 37:52.887
I know that Amy's in love
with Ben right now.

37:52.921 --> 37:54.155
But you never know.

37:54.189 --> 37:56.357
They're young.
Things might change.

37:56.391 --> 37:59.994
Yeah. Things may change,
all right.

38:06.068 --> 38:07.735
[ringing]

38:11.340 --> 38:12.740
[beeps]
Hello.

38:12.774 --> 38:14.609
Where are you?

38:14.643 --> 38:16.577
Um, in the shower.

38:16.612 --> 38:18.346
Can I call you back?

38:18.380 --> 38:21.749
No. And I don't hear
any water running.
I'll call you back.

38:21.783 --> 38:24.886
I was parked behind
your stupid truck
for two hours last night.

38:24.920 --> 38:27.722
Why?
Well, because I was driving
over to Lauren's house,

38:27.756 --> 38:31.092
and I saw your car parked
in front of some girl's house.

38:31.126 --> 38:33.027
What girl?
What do you mean,
"What girl?"

38:33.061 --> 38:35.463
Look, you're not
gonna be happy with this.

38:35.497 --> 38:37.064
[sighs]
Oh, no.

38:37.099 --> 38:39.700
Madison, I'm living with Tom
at the Bowman's guest house.

38:41.637 --> 38:43.271
No, you're not.

38:43.305 --> 38:44.338
What?

38:44.373 --> 38:47.208
I'll call you back.
[beeps]

38:48.143 --> 38:50.211
[sighs]

38:50.245 --> 38:51.679
Oh, my head.

38:51.713 --> 38:54.015
You can't live here.
Why not?

38:54.049 --> 38:56.350
Because my mom already said
you can't live with us,

38:56.385 --> 38:58.452
and when she finds out
you gave Tom pot brownies,

38:58.487 --> 39:00.221
she's probably gonna
have you arrested.

39:00.255 --> 39:02.690
I didn't know, all right?
They were in the freezer.

39:02.724 --> 39:05.860
So was the ice.
You didn't eat that.
What?

39:05.894 --> 39:08.563
Just get up, okay? Get out.
You cannot stay here.

39:08.597 --> 39:11.732
I have to stay here, Grace.
I have no place else to go.

39:14.136 --> 39:17.371
[chuckles]
You're pathetic,
do you know that?

39:17.406 --> 39:19.073
Yeah, I know that.

39:20.509 --> 39:23.878
[groaning]

39:23.912 --> 39:25.546
[exhales forcefully]

39:25.581 --> 39:28.649
Come on. I really need
somewhere to live.

39:28.684 --> 39:31.519
And Tom needs someone
to live with and...

39:31.553 --> 39:34.789
So will you just help me out
and not say anything
for a few more days?

39:34.823 --> 39:38.693
[sighs]
Well, I guess.

39:38.727 --> 39:41.429
I mean, this was
kind of my dad's hideout,

39:41.463 --> 39:43.431
and I know he would
want this for Tom,

39:43.465 --> 39:46.233
so I won't say anything
to my mom for a few days.

39:46.268 --> 39:49.303
But no more pot brownies
or any other illegal substance.

39:49.338 --> 39:51.005
Got it.

40:06.221 --> 40:08.289
Let's just forget
that happened.

40:09.491 --> 40:11.292
Let's not.

40:12.427 --> 40:14.495
All right.

40:23.972 --> 40:26.073
You could've told us
before now.

40:26.108 --> 40:28.976
I wouldn't have told you now,
but I need to talk to someone.

40:29.011 --> 40:31.712
I can't talk to my dad anymore.
I just can't.

40:31.747 --> 40:34.115
You must be going through hell,
and Adrian, too.

40:34.149 --> 40:35.850
I'm really sorry
you're going through this.

40:35.884 --> 40:37.151
It's more Adrian.

40:37.185 --> 40:38.753
Adrian's
going through this.

40:38.787 --> 40:41.322
Are you gonna go with her?
She doesn't want me
to be there.

40:41.356 --> 40:44.659
She probably just doesn't
wanna ask you to be there.

40:44.693 --> 40:48.029
And you two,
this is not something
that goes beyond this room.

40:48.063 --> 40:49.930
Got it?
[both]
Got it.

40:49.965 --> 40:52.199
I'm gonna go hang out
with Ruben.

40:53.435 --> 40:55.202
Well, he's by himself
with no one to talk to.

40:55.237 --> 40:56.537
Wanna come with me?

40:56.571 --> 40:58.172
Me? No.

40:58.240 --> 41:00.408
You want me to tell you again
where I think you should be
today?

41:00.442 --> 41:02.009
Please don't.

41:02.044 --> 41:04.211
I think I'm doing
the right thing
by just staying here.

41:04.246 --> 41:06.414
All right.

41:06.448 --> 41:09.183
I'll be back later.
You know when.

41:12.854 --> 41:15.289
Whoa, dude.
Bad move calling us over here.

41:15.323 --> 41:17.191
You better get to wherever
Adrian and her mom are.

41:17.225 --> 41:19.527
I don't know about that.
I don't know that
I'd want company.

41:19.561 --> 41:21.996
That could be part
of our hypothetical discussion.

41:22.030 --> 41:25.466
But, Ben, my friend,
this is not hypothetical.

41:25.500 --> 41:27.068
If Adrian's dad's not going

41:27.102 --> 41:28.736
and her mom's just sitting
there by herself--

41:28.770 --> 41:30.438
I don't know--
shouldn't you go?

41:30.472 --> 41:32.039
There is no good decision.

41:32.074 --> 41:33.741
Neither choice
is a good choice.

41:33.775 --> 41:35.376
You're right.
And that's where Adrian is.

41:35.410 --> 41:37.978
She had to make a choice,
and neither one probably
felt like a good one.

41:38.013 --> 41:41.415
All I could do
is just be there.

41:41.450 --> 41:42.717
Exactly.

41:48.990 --> 41:51.726
Okay, Ruben,
we'll see you later.

41:52.828 --> 41:54.628
All right.

41:54.663 --> 41:57.264
I'll see you later, Adrian.
I love you.

41:57.299 --> 41:58.199
Really?

41:58.233 --> 42:01.602
Of course.
I'm your dad.

42:01.636 --> 42:04.538
And even though
I don't want you to do this,

42:04.573 --> 42:06.741
you and your mother are right.

42:06.775 --> 42:09.276
This is your decision.

42:09.311 --> 42:13.414
Just...feel free
to change your mind.

42:15.016 --> 42:16.250
I had to say it.

42:17.686 --> 42:21.021
And I have to say this, too.

42:21.056 --> 42:23.090
I love you, Cindy,

42:23.125 --> 42:25.259
and you've been
a really good mother to Adrian.

42:27.195 --> 42:30.631
So, if I said anything
that implied otherwise,

42:30.665 --> 42:32.266
I'm really sorry.

42:33.835 --> 42:36.003
And I guess being a family

42:36.037 --> 42:38.906
doesn't necessarily mean
we have to agree on everything,

42:38.940 --> 42:41.275
not even the most basic
fundamental things.

42:43.178 --> 42:49.483
And, uh, do you want me
to come with you?

42:49.518 --> 42:52.119
No, but thanks, Dad.

42:53.889 --> 42:55.456
I love you, too.

42:58.768 --> 43:01.840
You okay?
