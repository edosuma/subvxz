01:07.025 --> 01:09.483
<i>This year the association overseeing

01:09.570 --> 01:12.813
<i>has uncovered a cheating scandal,</i>

01:12.906 --> 01:16.570
<i>which has led to an exam leak

01:16.660 --> 01:20.825
<i>Further investigation is pending...</i>

01:34.678 --> 01:36.260
Jt's not mine.

01:38.557 --> 01:40.173
My name is Rinrada NiJthep.

01:40.267 --> 01:41.883
I'm in grade 12

01:41.977 --> 01:43.843
at Krungthep Thaweepanya School.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.685
You can call to check my school records.

01:52.112 --> 01:55.981
The STIC exam isn't beyond my ability.

02:19.431 --> 02:27.271
BAD GENIUS

02:27.314 --> 02:30.022
<i>Student Portfolio: Ms Rinrada Nilthep</i>

02:30.067 --> 02:33.526
<i>4.00 GPA. Grade 7, Academic Year 2011</i>

02:34.446 --> 02:35.778
<i>GRADE 9</i>

02:35.864 --> 02:38.857
Straight A's since Grade 1.

02:39.201 --> 02:41.409
Honour student since Grade 7 to Grade 9.

02:42.412 --> 02:46.656
Came in first place
in the school district's Maths Competition.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.997
National Crossword Champion.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.502
Also achievements in sports...

02:51.588 --> 02:52.749
this one is...

02:53.256 --> 02:54.337
swimming.

02:54.424 --> 02:55.790
You don't have to say anything else.

02:55.884 --> 02:57.671
This is enough.

02:58.095 --> 03:02.465
No need to ask whether
we would accept Lynn or not.

03:02.724 --> 03:04.386
The important question is...

03:04.810 --> 03:06.426
do you want to study here?

03:08.063 --> 03:09.645
What do you say, honey?

03:12.401 --> 03:16.645
I don't have to decide now, right?

03:20.784 --> 03:23.527
It's not that I don't want to study here.

03:24.371 --> 03:26.988
It's just that my old school
is more suitable for me.

03:27.082 --> 03:28.948
If I move here, my dad...

03:29.042 --> 03:31.409
will have to pay almost 150K per year.

03:31.503 --> 03:33.165
Why 150K?

03:33.338 --> 03:34.704
One semester is only 60K,

03:34.798 --> 03:37.131
so it only comes up to 120K.

03:40.971 --> 03:44.180
Correct. However,
my dad teaches at my old school,

03:44.266 --> 03:46.804
so in the mornings I can go with him.

03:47.269 --> 03:49.807
If I study here, I'd have
to take the skytrain

03:49.938 --> 03:53.522
including the motortaxi
from the station is 80 baht per day...

03:55.360 --> 03:57.898
for 8 months, which is 170 days,

03:58.113 --> 04:00.355
excluding holidays.

04:00.449 --> 04:03.032
It's approximately 13,600 baht per year.

04:03.160 --> 04:05.652
There's also lunch,

04:05.787 --> 04:09.030
it costs only 20 baht for 2 sides with rice.

04:09.207 --> 04:10.493
Here it's 35 baht.

04:10.584 --> 04:14.749
I'll also have to buy
new school supplies and uniforms.

04:14.838 --> 04:17.831
I think all in all...

04:18.966 --> 04:21.209
it might not be worth it.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.134
Gold medal in maths.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.060
Honey...

04:32.856 --> 04:34.222
I can afford it.

04:34.316 --> 04:35.397
No, you can't.

04:35.484 --> 04:37.476
What if you study for free?

04:43.074 --> 04:47.569
Vit, I'll add the free
lunch programme too, okay?

04:47.788 --> 04:52.123
You see, our school does value
how smart Lynn is.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.833
Now. Is it worth it?

04:56.546 --> 04:57.787
Yes.

04:58.423 --> 05:00.039
Worth bringing all this.

05:01.718 --> 05:03.050
It's worth it, right?

05:04.721 --> 05:06.462
<i>Letter of Authorisation</i>

Done.

05:14.773 --> 05:15.980
Wait!

05:24.825 --> 05:26.908
We've gotta use this ID for 3 years.

05:27.035 --> 05:28.492
Gotta look good.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.031
Okay?

05:34.209 --> 05:35.791
You're a new student, right?

05:36.211 --> 05:37.497
I'm Grace.

05:37.671 --> 05:38.912
I'm Lynn.

05:43.927 --> 05:44.838
What?

05:44.928 --> 05:46.385
Can I have a look?

05:46.513 --> 05:47.845
Take off your glasses.

05:48.598 --> 05:49.964
Trust me.

05:55.313 --> 05:56.303
Pretty!

05:59.192 --> 06:00.399
Smile. C'mon.

06:00.485 --> 06:02.818
Okay. Ready 1... 2.

06:03.446 --> 06:04.653
Go.

06:05.490 --> 06:07.402
You're next. Hurry.

06:18.503 --> 06:19.539
<i>Grace</i>

06:28.763 --> 06:32.177
My ID is after hers,
so we've sat together for 3 years.

06:32.517 --> 06:34.930
Lynn and I are besties.

06:35.270 --> 06:38.513
Everyone says Lynn's extra smart.
Me... well...

06:38.732 --> 06:41.600
I'm good at extracurricular activities.

06:44.237 --> 06:47.446
I'm pretty sure people think I'm stupid.

06:51.286 --> 06:53.619
The Headmistress came up with a new policy.

06:55.290 --> 06:59.250
To be in a school play,
you need at least a 3.25 GPA.

06:59.544 --> 07:03.379
Why? Am I too stupid to be in a play?

07:05.008 --> 07:06.249
I think...

07:06.593 --> 07:09.757
acting is harder than studying.

07:11.306 --> 07:12.217
Really?

07:12.349 --> 07:13.510
Yeah.

07:16.603 --> 07:20.347
Look, I've been tutoring
with Mr Sophon for weeks,

07:20.440 --> 07:22.397
but I still don't know shit.

07:22.692 --> 07:25.480
And maths really pulls my grades down.

07:25.987 --> 07:27.273
The answer is C.

07:28.031 --> 07:31.365
What! You got the answer just by glancing?

07:32.035 --> 07:33.492
Upside down too!

07:33.662 --> 07:35.119
Super easy.

07:40.460 --> 07:43.419
Union A with B, intersect with C.
Do the one's in the parentheses first,

07:43.505 --> 07:46.088
then intersect with C
is just whatever's left in C.

07:46.174 --> 07:47.631
That's the answer.

07:49.177 --> 07:51.885
Oh! I got it.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.882
Scholarship kids are the bomb.

08:00.271 --> 08:01.807
Another problem?

08:04.693 --> 08:06.605
Lynn, will you be my tutor?

08:09.656 --> 08:10.988
Why not?

08:11.366 --> 08:12.573
If you teach me,

08:12.659 --> 08:15.618
I'll buy you a milkshake
after school every day.

08:16.287 --> 08:17.403
Nah.

08:18.540 --> 08:20.452
You'll get to review the
lesson every evening.

08:20.709 --> 08:21.995
Not enough.

08:22.877 --> 08:24.163
What about...

08:26.506 --> 08:27.997
If you agree,

08:28.591 --> 08:32.380
I'll get to be your first
student, Mentor Lynn.

08:34.431 --> 08:35.763
Mentor Lynn.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.883
Mentor Lynn.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.596
Mentor Lynn.

08:43.982 --> 08:45.518
I like it.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.609
I'll teach you all of this today.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.778
<i>Grace told you I helped with her studies?</i>

08:52.657 --> 08:53.864
She's right.

08:53.950 --> 08:58.661
But, tutoring my friend isn't wrong, right?

09:01.499 --> 09:03.456
It's the time you've been waiting for.

09:03.460 --> 09:04.667

Take a deep breath, clear your mind.

09:13.428 --> 09:15.465
It's crystal clear.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.259
Students, you may start the exam.

09:22.520 --> 09:23.886
<i>Maths: 60 questions /30 marks</i>

10:07.315 --> 10:08.772
Mathematics...

10:09.150 --> 10:10.891
I've warned you before, it isn't easy.

10:10.985 --> 10:13.318
If you know you don't understand

10:13.738 --> 10:15.525
and you still don't come tutor with me,

10:15.615 --> 10:17.277
it's too late now.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.279
Kiss your grade goodbye.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.824
Grace.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.790
The paper is exactly like Mr Sophon's sheets!

10:30.088 --> 10:31.829
- Yeah!
- You can do it, right?

10:31.965 --> 10:32.830
No.

10:32.924 --> 10:34.415
Why not? I already taught you!

10:34.509 --> 10:35.795
I can't remember.

10:38.388 --> 10:39.754
Why are you two talking?!

10:40.140 --> 10:42.052
No questions, no cheating!

10:43.268 --> 10:46.136
I won't tolerate any
nonsense in my exam room.

11:36.529 --> 11:37.394
<i>Ms Rinrada Nilthep</i>

11:38.615 --> 11:39.696
Grace.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.663
The answers.

13:24.387 --> 13:26.504
Should I write my name on the scrap paper?

13:26.681 --> 13:27.888
Of course!

13:27.974 --> 13:29.306
Haven't you ever taken a test?

13:29.392 --> 13:30.724
Sorry, sir.

How about you? What did you get?

14:11.559 --> 14:13.300
Easy 4.

14:15.438 --> 14:17.430
Are you free tomorrow? Let's celebrate.

14:17.607 --> 14:18.723
Sure. Where?

14:19.734 --> 14:20.770
Let's got to Pat's then.

14:20.860 --> 14:21.941
Convenient.

14:23.738 --> 14:25.479
You've got a swimsuit, right?

14:38.086 --> 14:40.578
Pat, will it kill you to
just get in normally?

14:41.047 --> 14:42.163
Nope...

14:42.256 --> 14:43.417
but it's not cool.

14:44.008 --> 14:45.419
Ouch! I got water in my ear.

14:45.510 --> 14:47.718
Mr Pat, dinner is served.

14:47.929 --> 14:48.885
Just leave it.

14:49.972 --> 14:52.339
Babe, I'm cold.

15:00.775 --> 15:01.891
<i>Pat</i>

15:08.991 --> 15:10.983
Grace, are you looking for coral?

15:13.621 --> 15:16.489
I've told Grace to invite
you over many times.

15:16.999 --> 15:19.833
We're all in the same class,
but we hardly ever talk.

15:20.044 --> 15:21.000
Grace though...

15:21.087 --> 15:22.919
always Lynn this... Lynn that.

15:23.005 --> 15:24.086
Shut up.

15:24.173 --> 15:25.539
Are you jealous?

15:26.175 --> 15:29.634
Grace always says that you're so smart.

15:29.720 --> 15:32.713
Without you, her grades
wouldn't have improved.

15:34.725 --> 15:36.682
I even told her that...

15:37.061 --> 15:39.098
I want to have a bestie like you.

15:39.397 --> 15:41.559
I've seen you have lots of friends.

15:41.691 --> 15:42.898
You're right,

15:43.025 --> 15:47.645
but no one lends me their
eraser during exams.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.498
Why?

16:00.585 --> 16:02.872
You also want to be in the school play?

16:03.296 --> 16:05.663
Smart people like you don't understand.

16:05.923 --> 16:07.539
Thickheads like me,

16:07.633 --> 16:10.216
all want good grades.

16:10.803 --> 16:11.919
Damn.

16:12.346 --> 16:13.587
Babe!

16:13.764 --> 16:16.302
If I don't fail, Dad will get me a new car.

16:16.726 --> 16:18.342
Sounds good?

16:25.526 --> 16:27.734
I know that we aren't tight...

16:29.071 --> 16:30.687
but if you agree...

16:32.283 --> 16:34.445
I'll pay you 3K per subject.

16:35.286 --> 16:36.777
Per person.

16:37.079 --> 16:38.115

16:38.206 --> 16:39.162
Yeah.

16:40.333 --> 16:41.744
What do you mean?

16:41.834 --> 16:43.166
I've got 5 more friends.

16:43.252 --> 16:46.336
What if the teachers find out?

16:46.589 --> 16:48.376
Don't worry about that.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.795
All my friends can be trusted.

16:51.177 --> 16:53.794
Everyone is willing to pay.

16:55.723 --> 16:57.680
Think about it, this is only one subject.

16:58.684 --> 17:01.427
How many subjects in one semester?

17:01.604 --> 17:02.936
Not including PE...

17:03.022 --> 17:03.978
13?

17:04.065 --> 17:06.728
So in one exam season, you'll get...

17:06.817 --> 17:08.809
13 times...

17:08.903 --> 17:10.815
234,000 baht.

17:13.491 --> 17:15.574
Nice digits 234,000.

In exchange for your brains.

17:21.207 --> 17:22.492
Tick-Tock.

17:22.666 --> 17:26.330
Call it even for the school's 'tea money'.

17:27.588 --> 17:28.920
What tea money?

17:29.882 --> 17:30.793
Seriously?

17:30.883 --> 17:32.374
You really don't know?

17:33.094 --> 17:34.551
Everyone pays.

17:34.637 --> 17:36.299
The stupider you are, the more you pay.

17:36.973 --> 17:39.215
400K for me.

17:39.308 --> 17:42.267
This dumbass donated 20
iMac's to the library.

17:42.353 --> 17:44.094
But I got a scholarship.

17:45.773 --> 17:47.480
The scholarship is for studying.

17:48.276 --> 17:50.518
Don't forget about other maintenance.

18:03.249 --> 18:09.211

19:04.727 --> 19:06.935
I was going to sell it to buy a new car.

19:07.396 --> 19:09.183
You never play it anymore.

19:12.109 --> 19:15.728
I just remembered yesterday
was Mum's birthday.

19:23.537 --> 19:26.450
Why did you want me to move to this school?

19:27.375 --> 19:30.368
Most students from this school

19:30.544 --> 19:32.661
get scholarships to study abroad.

19:34.090 --> 19:36.924
I wanted to give you better opportunities.

19:38.135 --> 19:40.092
I'm not like Mum, you know.

19:40.805 --> 19:42.171
Have you ever thought that

19:42.431 --> 19:44.798
I might be happier at my old school?

19:50.439 --> 19:51.646
Three points.

19:52.942 --> 19:56.231
Don't be too loud
and disturb the neighbours. Eat dinner.

19:56.737 --> 19:58.023
I'm going to bed.

21:03.679 --> 21:07.514
Okay, I admit I paid Lynn.

21:09.185 --> 21:11.973
But paying her for piano lessons...

21:12.313 --> 21:14.521
isn't against any international law, right?

21:15.941 --> 21:17.352
Or is it?

21:17.902 --> 21:19.734
Will you send me to international court?

21:21.071 --> 21:24.360
Have you ever heard that classical music

21:24.492 --> 21:26.484
helps with the brain's development?

21:26.869 --> 21:29.361
We'll use 4 songs to represent...

21:29.455 --> 21:32.869
A, B, C and D.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.331
Memorise my finger movements.

21:42.593 --> 21:43.800
This is A.

21:43.969 --> 21:47.804
Remember it starts with the pinky
and finishes with the thumb.

21:49.975 --> 21:51.011
This is B.

21:51.143 --> 21:54.432
B is 43213, repeated twice.

21:58.859 --> 21:59.849
This is C.

22:02.988 --> 22:04.229
This one D.

22:05.407 --> 22:07.490
I'll give you 3 answers and skip 1.

22:07.576 --> 22:08.862
I'll repeat this pattern.

22:09.078 --> 22:11.115
So, it won't be suspicious.

22:11.205 --> 22:14.118
This'll keep the marks in check,
and be under the teacher's radar.

22:14.208 --> 22:17.201
Complete the remaining ones yourself.

22:22.800 --> 22:25.292
I'll start giving the answers at 9:15 a.m.

22:25.594 --> 22:27.881
Meanwhile, complete the remaining questions.

22:47.908 --> 22:48.739
D

23:17.605 --> 23:18.641
Lynn.

23:19.273 --> 23:20.764
This shirt is expensive.

23:21.525 --> 23:23.517
Getting rich from teaching piano?

23:25.696 --> 23:27.483
You can wear new clothes too, you know.

23:27.573 --> 23:30.111
They tease you at school
that you're a scrooge.

23:31.952 --> 23:33.864
I wouldn't mind a new pair of trousers too.

<i>Classical Piano Lessons by Mentor Lynn</i>

<i>Congratulations to Scholarship Students,
Academic Year 2013</i>

<i>GRADE 11</i>

<i>Bank</i>

24:23.587 --> 24:28.207
Stay tuned for more of Teen Genius.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.636
<i>Lynn and I study at the same school.</i>

24:39.436 --> 24:40.893
But we're not friends.

24:41.021 --> 24:42.762
Actually, we're competitors.

24:44.608 --> 24:46.190
What's wrong? Nervous?

24:47.903 --> 24:48.893
Umm.

24:50.489 --> 24:52.526
Did you have ramen for lunch?

24:54.243 --> 24:55.575
How do you know?

24:55.911 --> 24:57.573
You've got some on your shirt.

25:02.501 --> 25:04.117
Grubby and wrinkled.

25:05.546 --> 25:07.287
Here. A baby wipe.

25:09.508 --> 25:10.874
For your shirt.

25:14.388 --> 25:17.222
Hey! The reward is 5K!

25:19.101 --> 25:21.184
We'll actually get less than that.

25:21.270 --> 25:23.887
With 3% tax deduction, which is 150.

25:23.981 --> 25:27.224
So, it's only 4,850 or 2,425 each.

25:27.359 --> 25:28.816
It's still a lot.

25:29.445 --> 25:31.562
It's enough for a salmon buffet.

25:33.115 --> 25:36.950
If we win, you wanna go this evening?

25:42.791 --> 25:43.907
Nah.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.535
I don't like eating out.

25:46.754 --> 25:48.086
It's a waste of money.

25:49.173 --> 25:50.209
What's so funny?

25:50.340 --> 25:53.674
Nothing. You sound just like my dad.

25:54.553 --> 25:55.464
Is that good or bad?

25:55.512 --> 25:57.174
Of course! It's a good thing.

25:58.432 --> 26:01.596
Messy hair, wrinkled shirt, exactly like him.

26:07.441 --> 26:09.774
What? I just wanna fix your hair.

26:10.110 --> 26:12.352
We're gonna be on air soon, gotta look good.

26:17.367 --> 26:19.359
Looking dapper now.

26:25.250 --> 26:26.457
Ready?

26:27.628 --> 26:28.709
Umm.

<i>Final question.</i>

26:40.265 --> 26:45.135
<i>Tell me Pi's value with

26:45.813 --> 26:48.271
3.141592653589793...

26:48.357 --> 26:49.518
<i>I think that should do it!</i>

26:49.608 --> 26:53.272
<i>And the winner of this
week's Teen Genius is...</i>

26:53.403 --> 26:56.737
<i>Krungthep Thaweepanya School!</i>

26:59.451 --> 27:03.570
I'm really awestruck.
How did you get Pi's value so quickly?

27:04.790 --> 27:07.373
I didn't find it. I just memorised it.

27:08.502 --> 27:10.209
You memorised the value of Pi?

27:13.090 --> 27:15.924
I used to play memory games with my dad.

27:16.260 --> 27:19.753
Pi's value, names of people, and reservoirs.

27:19.972 --> 27:24.137
Brilliant. I'm so proud
of my scholarship students.

27:24.518 --> 27:25.725
Have a seat.

27:28.147 --> 27:31.060
I didn't ask you to come,
so I could praise you.

27:31.400 --> 27:33.687
I have good news for you.

27:34.528 --> 27:38.693
Next year, the Singaporean Embassy
is offering scholarships.

27:39.616 --> 27:42.529
No strings attached. It's a full scholarship.

27:42.619 --> 27:45.202
You can study a bachelors
and finish with a doctorate.

27:45.289 --> 27:48.498
Considering your grades,
behaviour and determination,

27:48.625 --> 27:54.246
I believe that you two
will represent the school well.

27:56.258 --> 27:58.124
There's a catch though.

27:58.927 --> 28:03.843
The school has been given only one slot.

28:04.224 --> 28:05.931
But that shouldn't be a problem, right?

28:06.226 --> 28:09.640
Yesterday, you two were teammates.

28:10.147 --> 28:13.606
But today rivals. Isn't this fun?

<i>Little Bank Laundry Service</i>

28:41.011 --> 28:42.627
The machine broke again.

28:43.305 --> 28:45.217
I can't finish the laundry in time.

28:58.528 --> 29:00.770
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

29:01.031 --> 29:02.988
Your hands are all calloused.

29:17.965 --> 29:21.129
It's understandable to
think that I cheated...

29:22.844 --> 29:25.006
but thinking that Bank would cheat too...

29:28.141 --> 29:29.848
Aside from my father,

29:30.310 --> 29:33.394
Bank is the only other hard-working
and most honest person

29:33.730 --> 29:35.938
I've ever known.

29:37.693 --> 29:38.900
Hey, Bank!

29:40.570 --> 29:41.731
What do you want, Tong?

29:41.863 --> 29:43.274
Did you study for the exam?

29:45.409 --> 29:46.616
Me too, man.

29:46.702 --> 29:47.818
I was sick and didn't finish studying.

29:47.911 --> 29:49.322
Same here.

29:49.413 --> 29:50.403
Then finish studying.

29:50.497 --> 29:51.829
Help me!

29:59.715 --> 30:01.206
Let me copy you.

30:03.677 --> 30:06.385
I really can't fail this time.

30:06.471 --> 30:08.212
I've already tried...

30:08.307 --> 30:11.095
but this piano code is just too hard for me.

30:12.102 --> 30:13.513
What piano code?

30:15.147 --> 30:17.230
Oh... not... it's just nothing.

30:18.859 --> 30:21.772
Hey, I won't copy for free.

30:22.946 --> 30:24.437
I'll pay you.

30:26.241 --> 30:28.324
3,000 baht, enough?

30:29.911 --> 30:32.403
My copying won't lower your marks.

30:33.707 --> 30:35.118
Wait! Listen to me!

30:35.208 --> 30:37.040
Bank!

30:37.294 --> 30:39.286
Bank!

30:39.504 --> 30:40.620
Damn it, Bank!

30:41.548 --> 30:43.710
Can't you help a brother?

30:44.051 --> 30:45.883
So damn merciless!

31:15.749 --> 31:17.081
Come on. Hurry.

31:19.044 --> 31:20.626
Today you're all taking the test together.

31:20.754 --> 31:22.791
Don't sit next to your classmates.

31:36.561 --> 31:39.269
All right, you may start your test.

31:43.276 --> 31:44.812

32:04.589 --> 32:08.208
<i>40. This exam paper is set 1.</i>

32:12.973 --> 32:16.762
Sir? How do we answer question 40?

32:17.727 --> 32:18.843
There are two sets of test papers.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.645
Just fill in according to the one you have.

32:31.950 --> 32:32.940
<i>A. Set 1</i>

32:32.993 --> 32:34.200
<i>B. Set 2</i>

33:23.877 --> 33:27.245
<i>Be careful. Tong's copying you!</i>

33:39.726 --> 33:42.218
Lynn! Which set did you get?

33:54.449 --> 33:55.735
So, which set?

33:56.660 --> 33:57.696
Set 1.

33:57.786 --> 33:59.197
Leave set 1 here.

34:03.375 --> 34:04.582
What?

34:07.170 --> 34:08.377
Row 3.

34:08.838 --> 34:09.998
Banjong.

34:10.172 --> 34:11.664
Crew cut with glasses.

34:13.301 --> 34:15.884
He's copying Rinrada who's
sitting next to him.

34:19.849 --> 34:21.010
I'll take a look myself.

34:21.101 --> 34:22.262
Don't worry.

34:22.393 --> 34:23.679
You can go.

34:26.398 --> 34:27.684
What?!

34:33.362 --> 34:35.400
You've got 30 minutes left.

35:08.940 --> 35:10.101
<i>A. Set 1</i>

36:07.832 --> 36:08.822
Tong.

36:09.084 --> 36:10.165
What?

36:10.251 --> 36:11.458
Switch papers.

36:18.635 --> 36:19.751
Now!

36:21.304 --> 36:22.135
<i>Banjong Wongpoom</i>

36:25.767 --> 36:27.474
20 minutes left.

36:31.272 --> 36:32.638
Lynn. Lynn.

36:32.982 --> 36:33.893
What?!

36:33.983 --> 36:36.191
Should I erase your name
and write mine instead?

36:36.277 --> 36:38.189
No! Just sit still.

36:58.800 --> 37:00.632
Another 10 minutes left.

37:26.536 --> 37:27.993
Last 5 minutes.

37:41.926 --> 37:43.337
<i>B. Set 2</i>

38:06.493 --> 38:07.700
Time's up.

38:14.375 --> 38:15.957
Stop writing!

38:21.090 --> 38:22.171
Hey!

38:22.425 --> 38:23.632
Put your pencils down!

38:30.475 --> 38:31.807
That's enough!

38:49.410 --> 38:51.993
Don't you have enough A's? That's it!

39:23.653 --> 39:25.565
<i>Gosh. The teacher's playing hardball.</i>

39:25.655 --> 39:27.567
<i>Mentor Lynn saves the day!</i>

39:34.289 --> 39:36.406
Close call. I'm not sure it's worth it.

39:37.584 --> 39:39.371
Well, 3,000 for 25 peeps.

39:39.460 --> 39:40.291
What do you think?

39:40.378 --> 39:41.368
Rinrada!

39:45.258 --> 39:47.250
You didn't write your
name on the scrap paper.

39:51.139 --> 39:53.552
<i>Rinrada, class 11/3</i>

39:53.641 --> 39:55.428
<i>and Banjong class 11/1,</i>

39:55.518 --> 39:58.135
<i>please come to
the Headmistress's office immediately.</i>

40:01.441 --> 40:02.397
I assure you.

40:02.483 --> 40:04.475
If you don't believe me,
then have Tong retake the test.

40:04.569 --> 40:06.561
You'll know the truth.

40:11.826 --> 40:13.909
I've called the both of you in...

40:14.495 --> 40:17.533
because Thanaphon said
there's been some cheating.

40:20.376 --> 40:23.335
There are 2 sets of test papers.
It's no point to cheat.

40:40.146 --> 40:42.638
I'm giving you a chance to tell the truth.

40:43.399 --> 40:45.265
Banjong, did you cheat?

40:54.702 --> 40:56.739
We'll soon find out.

40:57.121 --> 40:59.738
Thanaphon and Rinrada, you're excused.

41:00.124 --> 41:01.740
Banjong, you stay here.

41:11.594 --> 41:13.130
Lynn, don't leave yet.

41:17.767 --> 41:20.555
Why are these problems on your scrap paper?

41:21.521 --> 41:24.355
They're not the ones from your set.

41:39.497 --> 41:43.662
Please don't get caught.

41:48.339 --> 41:49.750
Everything will be okay.

41:50.049 --> 41:52.632
The Headmistress probably
wants to discuss the scholar...

42:04.856 --> 42:08.850
We have evidence that
Lynn completed her friend's paper.

42:12.572 --> 42:13.562
Lynn.

42:14.699 --> 42:16.565
Would you please explain, why?

42:17.618 --> 42:19.985
If you don't, then I will expel you.

42:22.999 --> 42:24.115
For the money.

42:28.129 --> 42:31.964
Tong tried to hire me to do his test.

42:32.050 --> 42:33.291
3,000 baht.

42:37.055 --> 42:39.638
I'm very disappointed in you.

42:40.933 --> 42:44.051
Vit, I accepted your daughter because...

42:44.729 --> 42:46.766
she's an honour student.

42:47.065 --> 42:49.728
But getting good grades isn't enough...

42:50.401 --> 42:52.267
she also needs to have good behaviour.

42:53.154 --> 42:55.487
You're a teacher, you should understand.

42:55.573 --> 42:57.906
Completing your friend's
exam paper is cheating.

42:57.992 --> 42:59.949
It's a violation of school policy.

43:01.120 --> 43:04.409
I could expel you right now.

43:06.084 --> 43:08.041
However, since this is your first time,

43:08.711 --> 43:11.203
I'll just cancel your scholarship.

43:19.097 --> 43:20.463
Yes, ma'am.

43:24.769 --> 43:28.558
Can't they just retake the exam?

43:32.235 --> 43:33.442
Remember Lynn.

43:34.028 --> 43:36.771
School is a place for studying,

43:37.281 --> 43:39.113
not a place for making money.

43:40.660 --> 43:42.026
What's so funny?

43:42.703 --> 43:44.239
You're being rude.

43:44.372 --> 43:45.328
Nothing.

43:45.414 --> 43:46.245
Mr Pravit,

43:46.374 --> 43:48.866
you're a teacher, didn't
you teach her manners?

43:53.131 --> 43:54.247
Sorry.

43:56.384 --> 43:58.171
I don't think I'm the only one

43:58.261 --> 44:00.674
who uses the school to make extra cash.

44:03.182 --> 44:04.468
What do you mean?

44:04.559 --> 44:08.018
I'm talking about the 'tea money'
that my dad paid.

44:10.481 --> 44:12.643
It's not called 'tea money'.

44:13.317 --> 44:15.434
It's school maintenance.

44:15.528 --> 44:19.272
Isn't school maintenance included
in the tuition fee?

44:19.365 --> 44:20.776
That's enough, Lynn!

44:29.500 --> 44:31.207
I just want her to graduate here.

44:31.794 --> 44:33.410
I'll take care of the remaining tuition.

44:33.504 --> 44:34.620
Let's go.

44:35.506 --> 44:36.542
That's fine.

44:37.550 --> 44:39.337
I have one condition.

44:41.596 --> 44:44.680
You're banned for the Singapore Scholarship.

44:55.651 --> 44:56.937
Okay.

44:57.236 --> 44:58.272
Let's go.

44:58.529 --> 44:59.940
What's the scholarship have to do with it?

45:00.323 --> 45:02.235
It's true that I let my friend copy me,

45:02.450 --> 45:04.316
but I've never copied anyone.

45:04.994 --> 45:08.954
My grades are from my own work and abilities.

45:09.040 --> 45:11.703
Other students also have these abilities.

45:11.876 --> 45:15.165
The person who deserves
this scholarship more is Thanaphon.

45:17.173 --> 45:19.005
If you can't accept this condition,

45:19.133 --> 45:20.749
then you can resign.

45:22.178 --> 45:23.714
All right, Mr Pravit?

45:26.515 --> 45:27.551
Yes, ma'am.

45:27.975 --> 45:29.216
Let's go, Lynn.

45:33.564 --> 45:35.681
Good luck with the scholarship.

45:50.665 --> 45:52.452
Well, if you found evidence...

45:54.418 --> 45:56.410
I guess Lynn really did cheat.

46:00.132 --> 46:01.964
But I have nothing to do with it.

46:03.511 --> 46:06.219
Being an honour student doesn't mean...

46:07.139 --> 46:09.426
we have the same behaviour.

46:11.435 --> 46:12.551
<i>Ms Rinrada Nilthep</i>

46:15.606 --> 46:19.475
Just what I thought.
It's not just for 3,000 baht.

46:22.446 --> 46:23.857
Piano lessons?

46:28.286 --> 46:33.873
Did you ever think that
it'd actually be better to teach them?

46:35.710 --> 46:37.667
But the Headmistress cheated first.

46:37.837 --> 46:41.330
How can you call it cheating?
I paid willingly.

46:41.424 --> 46:42.380
So did my friends!

46:42.466 --> 46:44.378
You still can't see you're wrong?!

46:59.400 --> 47:00.516
Fine.

47:00.943 --> 47:02.479
I'll take the blame.

47:04.864 --> 47:06.196
It's all my fault.

47:07.241 --> 47:08.903
I can't blame anyone else.

47:12.538 --> 47:14.404
If I can't raise you to be a good person,

47:14.582 --> 47:18.417
how dare I go ask other people
to pay for your tuition?

47:26.761 --> 47:30.380
I'll sell the car to pay
the remaining tuition.

47:33.184 --> 47:34.675
As for this shirt...

47:37.438 --> 47:38.929
I don't want it anymore.

47:41.901 --> 47:44.143
About going abroad, just forget it!

47:45.279 --> 47:46.861
You're not going anywhere.

47:47.156 --> 47:48.692
Stay here with me.

47:49.867 --> 47:52.450
Return all the money to your friends.

48:14.141 --> 48:17.134
No matter how bad you think of Lynn,

48:18.145 --> 48:19.511
but to me...

48:19.855 --> 48:22.142
she's truly a good friend.

48:30.241 --> 48:32.699
Sorry for being a crybaby,

48:33.619 --> 48:35.861
but it's not all an act.

48:40.960 --> 48:44.954
<i>GRADE 12</i>

48:53.889 --> 48:56.176
So? Look refreshing?

48:57.184 --> 48:58.220
Not bad.

48:59.186 --> 49:00.802
Casting is tomorrow.

49:01.021 --> 49:03.388
You didn't call just for this, right?

49:07.570 --> 49:09.357
How have you been?

49:09.447 --> 49:12.611
You can take care of yourselves
for the next semesters, right?

49:15.202 --> 49:18.912
Pat and I have other things to worry about.

49:23.752 --> 49:25.209
Has Pat told you, yet?

49:25.296 --> 49:27.413
We just got back from France.

49:27.756 --> 49:29.964
The trip was lots of fun.

49:30.050 --> 49:32.167
Yeah, 'cause you left me behind.

49:32.261 --> 49:34.844
- Well, it was a shopping spree.
- Mum.

49:34.930 --> 49:37.013
I got you something too.

49:37.349 --> 49:38.760
- Pat.
- Yes?

49:39.101 --> 49:40.808
Go fetch a red wine for me.

49:40.895 --> 49:43.353
Why don't you get the help to do it?

49:51.197 --> 49:52.529
Yes, sir.

49:59.914 --> 50:02.156
Grace, would you like any more dessert?

50:02.249 --> 50:03.535
No, thank you.

50:03.834 --> 50:07.043
We invited you over today

50:07.171 --> 50:09.254
because we would like to thank you.

50:10.216 --> 50:11.673
Thank me for what?

50:11.759 --> 50:14.593
For helping Pat with his studies.

50:14.970 --> 50:17.178
You have no idea...

50:17.473 --> 50:20.011
how stressed out we've been over his grades.

50:20.518 --> 50:23.226
But ever since Pat's been seeing you,

50:23.562 --> 50:26.396
he's like a totally different person.

50:27.691 --> 50:33.528
I think you're better than
all those famous tutors.

50:39.161 --> 50:41.198
We've been planning for some time

50:41.288 --> 50:45.874
that we want Pat to study
at the same college as I did, at Boston.

50:47.002 --> 50:50.621
But with his previous grades...

50:51.131 --> 50:53.544
I know he won't make it.

50:54.009 --> 50:56.126
So, I've an idea that...

50:57.721 --> 50:59.257
you should also go with him.

50:59.431 --> 51:01.047
So you can help him study.

51:02.685 --> 51:04.096
Sounds good?

51:15.823 --> 51:17.985
Don't worry about the expenses.

51:18.367 --> 51:21.075
We will take care of it.

51:21.787 --> 51:23.699
As for tuition fees...

51:25.207 --> 51:27.164
if you need any help...

51:29.128 --> 51:30.994
just let me know. No worries.

51:33.549 --> 51:35.165
I've some information for you already.

51:35.384 --> 51:37.046
Please take a look at it.

51:42.057 --> 51:45.516
If money isn't an issue, say yes, all right?

51:55.237 --> 51:57.570
You know of the STIC test, right?

51:59.074 --> 52:01.782
It's like GAT/PAT,
used to apply to American uni's.

52:01.869 --> 52:03.781
It's the same paper taken
at the same time worldwide.

52:03.871 --> 52:05.783
I have to take the STIC...

52:06.248 --> 52:08.786
and I need to take it within this year.

52:10.461 --> 52:11.668
If not...

52:11.754 --> 52:15.338
I won't be able to apply
to the uni's in time.

52:22.056 --> 52:24.389
I've already risked a lot for you, Grace.

52:30.022 --> 52:32.890
I don't feel comfortable asking you...

52:34.026 --> 52:36.359
but we really don't know what to do.

52:39.031 --> 52:41.819
Pat said he'll pay you 600K baht.

53:26.870 --> 53:29.283
Could you return this to Pat?

53:29.373 --> 53:30.454
Okay.

53:31.333 --> 53:33.325
Could I borrow a pen and some paper?

53:37.965 --> 53:43.336
<i>I really can't help you this time. Sorry.</i>

53:45.013 --> 53:46.254
Miss.

55:17.064 --> 55:18.475
Time zones.

55:18.982 --> 55:22.020
The STIC is taken at the same time
and date worldwide.

55:22.528 --> 55:26.272
So, these countries will
take the exam before the rest.

55:28.659 --> 55:29.945
Let me break it down.

55:30.035 --> 55:31.742
If you two take it in Thailand,

55:31.829 --> 55:34.697
while I fly over and take
it somewhere earlier.

55:35.040 --> 55:36.781
Let's say Sydney, Australia.

55:37.000 --> 55:38.832
It's 4 hours ahead of Thailand.

55:39.211 --> 55:41.123
I will get to see the exam first.

55:41.338 --> 55:43.204
Complete it first.

55:43.507 --> 55:46.045
I can send you guys the answers,

55:46.218 --> 55:49.928
along with the others in Thailand
to as many as we want.

55:50.055 --> 55:52.843
Oh my God.

55:53.725 --> 55:58.971
You will not only get a passing score,

55:59.648 --> 56:01.981
but we will also make money from the others.

56:02.860 --> 56:06.149
After deducting the costs,
we'll split the profits.

56:08.323 --> 56:10.110
Is it too risky?

56:10.993 --> 56:11.733
What risk?

56:11.827 --> 56:12.943
It's not risky at all.

56:13.078 --> 56:14.068
Who is this?

56:14.162 --> 56:15.824
Mentor Lynn, babe.

56:16.331 --> 56:17.947
This is the only way

56:18.500 --> 56:20.617
I can earn enough to go study with you,

56:20.711 --> 56:22.623
without asking anyone for money.

56:25.048 --> 56:27.131
Oh, I forgot to mention...

56:28.802 --> 56:30.668
I'm going to Boston with you guys.

56:33.724 --> 56:36.387
It'll be fun if we go together.

56:39.313 --> 56:41.646
You two will be responsible for

56:41.940 --> 56:43.431
finding clients.

56:43.650 --> 56:45.186
For the exam part,

56:45.402 --> 56:46.267
I'll take care of it.

56:46.445 --> 56:47.526
Wait.

56:48.030 --> 56:50.488
Before we go looking for clients,

56:50.866 --> 56:53.108
I understand this time zone thing,

56:53.493 --> 56:54.984
but I'm still confused

56:55.078 --> 56:57.491
how the heck can you get the answers out?

56:58.165 --> 56:59.497
Write them down?

57:00.334 --> 57:01.541
Memorise them.

57:04.379 --> 57:06.291
The best way is to memorise it.

57:06.548 --> 57:08.005
It's the safest.

57:08.133 --> 57:09.840
There won't be a paper trail.

57:09.968 --> 57:12.881
Sorry. Are you one of the X-Men?

57:12.971 --> 57:15.509
The STIC has over 100 questions.

57:15.599 --> 57:17.261
How are you gonna remember all that?

57:17.434 --> 57:18.675
I can do it.

57:19.478 --> 57:20.935
If there's enough time.

57:22.189 --> 57:24.272
The problem is after I finish the test...

57:24.358 --> 57:25.940
there's not much time left.

57:26.026 --> 57:29.269
The most I can remember now is half of it.

57:29.404 --> 57:30.690
Only half?

57:32.908 --> 57:34.945
There's one person who could help.

57:35.535 --> 57:37.401
But he wouldn't.

57:45.837 --> 57:47.123
<i>What's up, Mum?</i>

57:47.714 --> 57:48.955
Yeah, I'm done.

57:52.844 --> 57:54.426
Ms Rut's house?

57:56.723 --> 57:57.804
Can't it be another day?

57:57.891 --> 57:58.927
Tomorrow...

57:59.685 --> 58:02.143
I have the scholarship exam at 8:00 a.m.

58:03.897 --> 58:05.138
Okay.

58:12.447 --> 58:13.233
Hey, you!

58:13.323 --> 58:15.360
Your basket grazed by mirror!

58:15.617 --> 58:16.733
If you said sorry...

59:11.923 --> 59:13.710
250K for a passing score...

59:14.176 --> 59:15.542
little money for you, right?

59:15.635 --> 59:17.797
The tutorial fee for STIC
is way more expensive.

59:17.888 --> 59:21.472
We'll need approximately 30 clients.

59:21.725 --> 59:23.091
If more than this, it will be risky.

59:23.185 --> 59:25.472
Anything less won't be worth it.

59:27.105 --> 59:30.519
I've got almost 30 people
in my STIC group chat.

59:31.860 --> 59:33.726
If you get them to join,

59:33.987 --> 59:35.899
you'll get 5,000 baht discount per head,

59:36.073 --> 59:37.814
deducted from your full payment.

59:38.241 --> 59:39.607
Wait a minute.

59:40.660 --> 59:43.573
You must make sure
no one else knows about this.

59:44.956 --> 59:46.743
Especially, that loser Bank.

59:47.542 --> 59:49.078
Don't mind that dumbass.

59:49.544 --> 59:50.830
He won't say anything.

59:51.088 --> 59:52.249
Why?

59:52.380 --> 59:53.370
Didn't you hear?

59:55.425 --> 59:58.418
That dumbass got beaten up.

59:58.678 --> 01:00:00.044
He's now in hospital.

01:00:10.273 --> 01:00:11.559
<i>The best part is...</i>

01:00:11.650 --> 01:00:13.812
<i>he didn't make it to the scholarship exam.</i>

01:00:22.369 --> 01:00:27.285
<i>Seminar: To Excel in Education - 2B COME WON</i>

01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:31.117
I believe that everyone here

01:00:31.211 --> 01:00:33.043
wants to pass the STIC

01:00:33.588 --> 01:00:36.706
for your brighter future.

01:00:37.259 --> 01:00:39.467
He's Steve Pat.

01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:44.381
I have a way for us all
to get satisfactory scores.

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:47.308
The only things you're
allowed in the exam room

01:00:47.519 --> 01:00:48.976
is a 2B pencil,

01:00:49.146 --> 01:00:50.307
eraser,

01:00:51.106 --> 01:00:52.392
exam ID,

01:00:53.233 --> 01:00:54.565
and passport.

01:00:55.235 --> 01:00:58.524
Communication devices
aren't definitely allowed.

01:00:58.864 --> 01:01:03.359
So, I'll hide the phone used
to send the answers back to you

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:05.906
inside a toilet tank in the washroom.

01:01:06.246 --> 01:01:09.739
I'll send the answers back in between breaks.

01:01:10.041 --> 01:01:12.408
The exam is split into 3 parts,

01:01:12.502 --> 01:01:14.118
with 2 breaks.

01:01:14.462 --> 01:01:15.998
Wait. Just a sec.

01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:18.627
How will the clients bring
all the answers to the exam?

01:01:18.717 --> 01:01:20.925
Not everyone is capable like you.

01:01:25.932 --> 01:01:27.264
Barcode.

01:01:31.771 --> 01:01:35.264
Everyone will receive 2B pencils
with a barcode stuck on it.

01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:38.230
The different widths of the barcode

01:01:38.403 --> 01:01:39.610
will represent the answer choices.

01:01:39.696 --> 01:01:41.983
Starting from the left to right.

01:01:42.741 --> 01:01:45.279
The thickest is A,

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:48.111
then B, C, and D.

01:01:48.914 --> 01:01:50.280
Sounds cool, huh?

01:01:50.498 --> 01:01:51.739
But the fun doesn't end here.

01:01:51.917 --> 01:01:53.499
There are 4 pencils.

01:01:53.627 --> 01:01:56.961
One pencil for one section.

01:01:58.548 --> 01:02:03.088
The numbers next to the barcode are
for grid-in questions.

01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:05.381
For the essay part,

01:02:05.472 --> 01:02:07.930
they usually use published articles.

01:02:08.350 --> 01:02:10.717
I'll send you the key words to Google it.

01:02:10.810 --> 01:02:12.267
Hey, it's mine.

01:02:12.354 --> 01:02:13.344
It fell.

01:02:13.772 --> 01:02:17.812
Hey, pay attention!
You will have to write the essay yourself.

01:02:18.652 --> 01:02:20.860
In short, on the exam day,

01:02:21.196 --> 01:02:24.860
everyone will leave the meeting point
before 7.30 a.m.

01:02:25.033 --> 01:02:27.320
to arrive at the exam centres on time.

01:02:27.494 --> 01:02:29.986
We will provide motortaxis for you

01:02:30.121 --> 01:02:32.659
to take you to the exam centres.

01:02:32.791 --> 01:02:34.157
Finally...

01:02:34.793 --> 01:02:38.457
everyone will have to pay
in cash within 2 weeks.

01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:42.089
Otherwise, the deal will be cancelled.

01:02:44.928 --> 01:02:47.011
I'd also like to emphasise that

01:02:47.806 --> 01:02:51.971
what we are doing is confidential.

01:02:53.353 --> 01:02:54.560
Any problems?

01:02:57.482 --> 01:02:58.848
<i>If there aren't...</i>

01:02:59.025 --> 01:03:00.641
<i>I will end the seminar now.</i>

01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:05.191
We will unite together

01:03:05.573 --> 01:03:07.815
to excel in education.

01:03:08.535 --> 01:03:11.653
We'll get the scores
we need to get in all the universities.

01:03:12.497 --> 01:03:14.284
We will choose the university.

01:03:14.374 --> 01:03:17.242
They don't get to choose us!

01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:34.722
Whoa. That's rough, Little Bank.

01:03:49.075 --> 01:03:50.361
What's up?

01:03:51.828 --> 01:03:53.160
Sorry to hear that...

01:03:53.538 --> 01:03:55.621
you missed out on the scholarship.

01:04:01.755 --> 01:04:03.087
Same here.

01:04:05.633 --> 01:04:07.249
That day...

01:04:07.969 --> 01:04:09.835
I really didn't mean to.

01:04:11.806 --> 01:04:14.048
I wouldn't know if you meant it or not.

01:04:14.309 --> 01:04:15.675
What I do know is that...

01:04:15.810 --> 01:04:18.553
you're responsible for what happened.

01:04:23.985 --> 01:04:26.227
I have a proposition for you.

01:04:26.821 --> 01:04:28.107
What's it?

01:04:28.406 --> 01:04:29.772
Taking an exam.

01:04:34.788 --> 01:04:36.996
Take or cheat an exam?

01:04:37.165 --> 01:04:39.077
To me the word cheat

01:04:39.167 --> 01:04:41.284
means that one person loses something.

01:04:43.129 --> 01:04:45.371
But we will get money,
and the others will get good scores.

01:04:45.548 --> 01:04:46.914
Win-win.

01:04:53.848 --> 01:04:54.964
Bank.

01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:58.471
We both are losers, you know.

01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:02.179
We're not born winners like Grace and Pat.

01:05:02.899 --> 01:05:06.563
We must try harder to get what's ours.

01:05:08.029 --> 01:05:09.190
Look, what happened?

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:10.737
It's not the same.

01:05:11.366 --> 01:05:12.652
You cheated.

01:05:13.743 --> 01:05:15.154
I was just unlucky.

01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:19.788
True.

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:23.333
But don't you see even if you don't cheat...

01:05:23.962 --> 01:05:26.204
life cheats you anyways.

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:33.756
This is Grace's address.

01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:35.717
See you tomorrow if you're interested.

01:06:24.814 --> 01:06:26.180
Sit here.

01:06:29.319 --> 01:06:30.810
Aren't you gonna sit?

01:06:41.956 --> 01:06:43.618
This is what's gonna happen...

01:06:44.292 --> 01:06:45.533
first...

01:06:46.002 --> 01:06:49.541
we'll fly to Sydney and
take the STIC together.

01:06:59.724 --> 01:07:00.965
Hey, Lynn.

01:07:02.393 --> 01:07:04.430
You're missing a document.

01:07:05.063 --> 01:07:05.803
Dad.

01:07:05.897 --> 01:07:08.105
You remember that programme, Teen Genius?

01:07:08.191 --> 01:07:10.183
They want me to compete in Sydney.

01:07:20.245 --> 01:07:22.783
They need your bank statement
for visa purposes.

01:07:23.039 --> 01:07:24.405
Who are you going with?

01:07:24.582 --> 01:07:25.538
With Bank.

01:07:26.834 --> 01:07:27.950
Huh?

01:07:28.628 --> 01:07:31.086
It's not just the two of us,
there's a teacher too.

01:07:34.801 --> 01:07:35.666
<i>Second...</i>

01:07:35.927 --> 01:07:37.043
You and I...

01:07:37.178 --> 01:07:39.295
will have to memorise the answers, half each.

01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:40.546
Don't forget...

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:41.630
Bank memorises the first half,

01:07:41.724 --> 01:07:43.056
and Lynn the second half.

01:07:43.685 --> 01:07:45.551
Section 1 has 52 questions.

01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:46.851
Start!

01:07:49.357 --> 01:07:51.394
<i>SECTION 1: 52 QUESTIONS</i>

01:07:53.444 --> 01:07:55.481
<i>SECTION 3: 16 GRID-IN QUESTIONS</i>

01:07:55.655 --> 01:07:56.987
For the last section,

01:07:57.115 --> 01:08:01.530
you need to leave early
to send the essay question.

01:08:01.953 --> 01:08:05.162
Time's up for section 4. Start the essay.

01:08:06.374 --> 01:08:09.162
Memorising the key words
shouldn't be difficult for you.

01:08:09.335 --> 01:08:13.079
But the hard part is
they won't let you leave early.

01:08:15.216 --> 01:08:16.923
To avoid any suspicion...

01:08:17.385 --> 01:08:18.716
you have to act sick.

01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:21.256
Sure.

01:08:22.015 --> 01:08:23.176
I can throw up.

01:08:32.859 --> 01:08:34.066
I have to puke now?

01:08:34.234 --> 01:08:35.395
No!

01:08:42.577 --> 01:08:44.408
How much is my cut?

01:08:49.876 --> 01:08:51.287
1 million.

01:09:04.432 --> 01:09:05.673
How much is yours?

01:09:08.435 --> 01:09:09.596
2 million.

01:09:14.859 --> 01:09:16.191
What do you say, Bank?

01:09:16.486 --> 01:09:18.193
Everything is in your hands.

01:09:23.785 --> 01:09:24.946
Okay.

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:31.616
Got it!

01:09:31.709 --> 01:09:33.200
- In time.
- Yes!

01:09:34.754 --> 01:09:37.872
You should've just said yes from the start.
Such a poser.

01:09:56.401 --> 01:09:57.812
Hey, guys!

01:10:00.822 --> 01:10:02.484
See you tomorrow at 1:00 p.m.

01:10:02.657 --> 01:10:04.398
Have you lost it?

01:10:04.534 --> 01:10:06.150
The flight's at 11:00 p.m.

01:10:06.244 --> 01:10:07.655
What's the rush?

01:10:07.954 --> 01:10:10.788
There is one more thing we need to rehearse.

01:10:17.839 --> 01:10:19.375
That's enough.

01:10:19.882 --> 01:10:24.126
You just can't keep on grilling the innocent!

01:10:26.723 --> 01:10:28.555
You must be enjoying...

01:10:28.808 --> 01:10:32.848
seeing the innocent cry like this.

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:44.521
That's too much, Pat. Way too much.

01:10:45.867 --> 01:10:47.779
I've used up all my cards.

01:10:47.869 --> 01:10:50.111
You guys act as if we really got caught.

01:10:50.538 --> 01:10:52.029
I told you I understand...

01:10:52.123 --> 01:10:54.991
if you get caught, we'll blame only you.

01:10:56.210 --> 01:10:58.497
Last question before heading to the airport.

01:10:58.588 --> 01:10:59.954
Last question.

01:11:03.176 --> 01:11:04.462
In character.

01:11:04.594 --> 01:11:05.880
Ready?

01:11:08.681 --> 01:11:10.718
What if Bank gets caught?

01:11:10.933 --> 01:11:12.549
What will you say?

01:11:16.355 --> 01:11:17.937
That's even more far-fetched.

01:11:18.065 --> 01:11:19.522
I'm not even friends with him.

01:11:19.609 --> 01:11:21.771
I've seen him around school for 4-5 years.

01:11:21.861 --> 01:11:23.773
I've never seen him with friends.

01:11:24.322 --> 01:11:25.733
He looks like a douchebag.

01:11:25.865 --> 01:11:27.322
Weirdo.

01:11:27.992 --> 01:11:33.329
He even got beaten up
and ended up in a landfill.

01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:40.956
Are we finished?

01:11:42.882 --> 01:11:44.168
Stop!

01:11:45.718 --> 01:11:46.879
Stop it, Bank!

01:11:46.969 --> 01:11:48.176
Stop!

01:11:48.596 --> 01:11:50.212
I told you to stop!

01:11:51.307 --> 01:11:52.639
Dumbass!

01:11:53.309 --> 01:11:54.595
Get off him!

01:12:05.571 --> 01:12:07.062
What the hell is wrong with you?

01:12:09.867 --> 01:12:12.450
You're the one who told me to say this.

01:12:12.745 --> 01:12:14.737
So, why are you mad at me?

01:12:15.748 --> 01:12:17.410
Pat, stop.

01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:18.831
Bank...

01:12:19.001 --> 01:12:20.537
Bank, enough.

01:12:23.005 --> 01:12:23.836
Why?

01:12:23.923 --> 01:12:25.289
- Why?
- I...

01:12:25.466 --> 01:12:27.423
- You... what?!
- never...

01:12:27.927 --> 01:12:31.216
told anyone that I woke up in a landfill!

01:12:34.475 --> 01:12:36.808
Now you know what I'm mad about!

01:12:39.605 --> 01:12:41.517
You all set this up, right?

01:12:42.525 --> 01:12:45.108
You guys set me up
so I couldn't get the scholarship.

01:12:46.112 --> 01:12:48.354
All of you were in it, right?

01:12:48.865 --> 01:12:50.982
You guys knew, right?

01:12:51.617 --> 01:12:52.858
Right?

01:12:54.328 --> 01:12:56.115
You knew, right?

01:12:56.956 --> 01:12:58.913
Why aren't you answering?

01:13:00.459 --> 01:13:01.745
Bank... wait.

01:13:01.836 --> 01:13:02.872
Calm down, Bank.

01:13:02.962 --> 01:13:04.749
I don't freaking want to hear from you again!

01:13:05.423 --> 01:13:09.167
Bank, wait! Let's talk!

01:13:12.805 --> 01:13:14.797
Calm down. Calm down.

01:13:15.266 --> 01:13:16.677
You okay?

01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:19.597
I'm sorry, Bank.

01:13:19.979 --> 01:13:22.221
I'm sorry.

01:13:22.607 --> 01:13:24.348
I didn't think they'd be so rough on you.

01:13:24.442 --> 01:13:26.149
Bank, hear me out.

01:13:26.569 --> 01:13:28.526
You'll still take the STIC, right?

01:13:29.447 --> 01:13:31.234
Forget the damn STIC!

01:13:31.866 --> 01:13:33.482
Bank... Bank, listen to me.

01:13:33.576 --> 01:13:35.158
You, listen to me!

01:13:35.286 --> 01:13:37.903
It's just me and my mum.

01:13:38.039 --> 01:13:39.655
She's like a hunchback, doing laundry.

01:13:39.749 --> 01:13:40.455
You...

01:13:40.541 --> 01:13:42.157
I'm not rich like you.

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:44.914
The scholarship was my dream.

01:13:45.254 --> 01:13:48.088
My dream for my mum to be comfortable.

01:13:48.215 --> 01:13:49.831
So, damn you!

01:13:50.051 --> 01:13:54.045
Bank, if I don't pass the STIC,
my dad will kill me.

01:13:54.347 --> 01:13:55.383
Please, Bank.

01:13:55.473 --> 01:13:56.554
Please.

01:13:59.769 --> 01:14:01.852
Win-win, for us both.

01:14:04.190 --> 01:14:06.773
Please, Bank.

01:14:06.901 --> 01:14:08.017
Then...

01:14:08.778 --> 01:14:11.691
send those thugs to beat up your dad!

01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:16.407
What the hell is wrong with you?!

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.993
Weren't you the one who
told me you needed him?

01:14:27.505 --> 01:14:29.121
If I didn't play dirty,

01:14:29.215 --> 01:14:31.207
do you think he'd help?

01:15:04.834 --> 01:15:05.870
Lynn.

01:15:06.961 --> 01:15:08.577
Let's talk first.

01:15:09.130 --> 01:15:10.621
Were you in on this?

01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:15.751
No, I had no clue.

01:15:17.304 --> 01:15:19.296
Please try to understand Pat.

01:15:19.598 --> 01:15:20.588
He did it because...

01:15:20.683 --> 01:15:22.265
he wanted to help with your plan.

01:15:22.351 --> 01:15:26.140
Without considering who would get hurt?!

01:15:32.528 --> 01:15:38.490
<i>The Future of Laundry</i>

01:15:39.827 --> 01:15:41.443
Grace, return everyone's money.

01:15:41.537 --> 01:15:42.448
I'm pulling out.

01:15:43.205 --> 01:15:44.537
Wait, Lynn.

01:15:45.958 --> 01:15:47.039
Calm down.

01:15:47.126 --> 01:15:49.664
Okay. I respect your decision.

01:15:49.795 --> 01:15:50.831
It's okay.

01:15:50.921 --> 01:15:52.162
No more clients, okay?

01:15:52.256 --> 01:15:54.669
Just the 3 of us. The original plan.

01:15:55.051 --> 01:15:56.633
Don't you understand?

01:15:57.219 --> 01:15:59.336
When I said no, I meant no.

01:16:06.562 --> 01:16:07.678
Fine.

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:09.972
Up to you then.

01:16:14.195 --> 01:16:15.652
I just have one request.

01:16:15.738 --> 01:16:17.525
Don't be mad at me.

01:16:21.911 --> 01:16:23.447
If I had half your brains,

01:16:23.537 --> 01:16:25.904
I wouldn't do something this stupid.

01:16:26.248 --> 01:16:27.455
Please.

01:16:51.232 --> 01:16:52.643

I'll go through with it.

01:17:16.132 --> 01:17:17.873
At least there's money in it.

01:17:18.884 --> 01:17:21.092
I won't get beaten up for free.

01:17:22.847 --> 01:17:24.338
What if I told you that...

01:17:24.557 --> 01:17:26.173
I don't wanna do it anymore.

01:17:29.562 --> 01:17:31.178
I'm not asking you.

01:17:32.606 --> 01:17:34.689
The reason why I'm here is because of you.

01:17:35.109 --> 01:17:37.476
You're why I ended up in that landfill.

01:17:37.903 --> 01:17:40.361
All of this shit is because of you.

01:17:41.699 --> 01:17:44.863

01:18:59.735 --> 01:19:01.021
your nose.

01:19:07.743 --> 01:19:08.859
Okay.

01:19:16.001 --> 01:19:17.242
You know...

01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:26.172
I've never been abroad before.

01:19:41.527 --> 01:19:43.189
From tomorrow onwards,

01:19:43.904 --> 01:19:46.271
the world is our oyster.

01:19:59.628 --> 01:20:01.244
Let's take a selfie.

01:20:07.970 --> 01:20:09.461
<i>FINAL TEST</i>

01:20:38.125 --> 01:20:41.618
<i>Classical Music for Studying</i>

01:24:54.506 --> 01:24:57.749
The first break is from 5:15- 5:25 a.m.

01:25:01.096 --> 01:25:04.339
<i>We're ready.</i>

01:26:46.034 --> 01:26:47.570
<i>Bank?</i>

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:54.373
<i>I want another million.</i>

01:26:55.001 --> 01:26:56.333
1 more million? You ass!

01:26:56.420 --> 01:26:57.376
Screw you!

01:26:57.629 --> 01:26:58.494
Damn you!

01:26:58.588 --> 01:26:59.374
Pat!

01:27:06.805 --> 01:27:08.512
<i>What's wrong?</i>

01:27:15.313 --> 01:27:16.269
Damn!

01:27:17.899 --> 01:27:22.894
<i>Transfer the money in 5 min
or forget about the answers.</i>

01:27:26.825 --> 01:27:28.407
Damn it!

01:27:28.493 --> 01:27:29.859
What 5 minutes?!

01:27:29.953 --> 01:27:32.616
Ask him! What the hell is wrong with him?!

01:27:32.706 --> 01:27:34.572
Calm down. Keep your cool.

01:27:34.666 --> 01:27:36.407
I can't keep cool!

01:27:38.670 --> 01:27:40.753
Bank, you bastard!

01:27:43.717 --> 01:27:47.301
<i>This's Grace. I thought we already agreed.</i>

01:27:51.183 --> 01:27:56.224
<i>1 million for my fee
and another for getting beaten up.</i>

01:28:06.990 --> 01:28:10.825
<i>This is all I've got.
You'll get more when I get the answers.</i>

01:28:31.348 --> 01:28:32.259
Okay.

01:28:32.349 --> 01:28:33.806
A, B, B, C, C, A

01:28:37.395 --> 01:28:39.808
C, A, B, C, D, B

01:28:42.317 --> 01:28:44.479
B, A, C, B, C, D

01:29:00.001 --> 01:29:01.367
Fair game.

01:29:01.795 --> 01:29:03.252
Back in the game.

01:30:58.787 --> 01:31:00.995
<i>Next, Grid-in answers.</i>

01:37:13.828 --> 01:37:16.320
<i>For Sale</i>

01:37:25.465 --> 01:37:27.502
Don't we need to leave before 7:30 a.m.?

01:37:27.592 --> 01:37:28.708
Yeah!

01:39:11.529 --> 01:39:14.363
It's 7 a.m. Where's the rest of the answers?!

01:39:14.449 --> 01:39:15.656
I don't know!

01:39:29.922 --> 01:39:31.288
Good morning.

01:39:43.853 --> 01:39:45.060
Is Lynn here?

01:39:45.146 --> 01:39:46.637
I can't get in touch with her.

01:39:47.773 --> 01:39:48.980
I haven't seen her.

01:39:51.527 --> 01:39:54.235
She told me
she went to Sydney for a competition.

01:39:54.447 --> 01:39:55.563
Oh yeah.

01:39:56.115 --> 01:39:58.823
No wonder I haven't seen her.

01:39:59.118 --> 01:40:00.859
I'm sure she'll bring back a medal.

01:40:02.121 --> 01:40:04.363
But I found this permission letter at home.

01:40:04.707 --> 01:40:06.744
I called, but no one answered.

01:40:26.229 --> 01:40:28.095
So, I came to this address.

01:40:45.748 --> 01:40:48.411
Someone tell me why Lynn's in Sydney?

01:41:56.444 --> 01:41:58.936
If you don't answer,
I'll go to the Headmistress.

01:42:34.231 --> 01:42:37.395
Tell me now what are you up to!

01:42:49.497 --> 01:42:51.284
Lynn and Bank are a couple!

01:42:52.041 --> 01:42:53.998
They went on a secret trip.

01:43:02.968 --> 01:43:06.086
Lynn was afraid you wouldn't let her go.

01:43:06.180 --> 01:43:07.546
So, she lied.

01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:09.973
I really didn't know how to stop her.

01:43:10.309 --> 01:43:16.306
It's best you talk to your daughter, sir.

01:43:21.278 --> 01:43:22.439
Fine.

01:43:37.753 --> 01:43:39.085
C'mon!

01:43:46.095 --> 01:43:47.256
Sir.

01:43:47.555 --> 01:43:49.638
Love is a beautiful thing.

01:44:13.789 --> 01:44:15.075
What's up?

01:44:15.624 --> 01:44:18.037
It's 7 a.m. already.
The motortaxis are leaving.

01:44:18.127 --> 01:44:19.709
It's a lot later than agreed.

01:44:19.879 --> 01:44:21.461
Tell me what's wrong.

01:44:21.630 --> 01:44:23.212
I don't know a damn thing!

01:44:23.299 --> 01:44:24.915
I'll talk to them.

01:44:26.427 --> 01:44:27.838
What's with your leg?

01:44:28.053 --> 01:44:29.794
- It's almost 7:30.
- What are we waiting for?

01:44:29.889 --> 01:44:31.596
- Where are the barcodes?
- I've already paid.

01:44:31.682 --> 01:44:32.798
It'll be okay.

01:44:42.943 --> 01:44:44.650
You'll get there in time.

01:44:44.779 --> 01:44:45.940
I promise.

01:45:11.055 --> 01:45:13.092
Pat! We've run out of stickers.

01:45:21.774 --> 01:45:23.561
Here you go. 500 each.

01:45:23.651 --> 01:45:25.859
Chill. We'll leave soon.

01:45:45.756 --> 01:45:46.997
Shit!

01:45:48.592 --> 01:45:52.336
Hey! Can you please open the door?!

01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:38.886
It's almost 7:30, Grace!

01:46:38.976 --> 01:46:39.841
We have all the answers?!

01:46:39.935 --> 01:46:41.597
No! Another 6.

01:46:44.857 --> 01:46:45.847
Why's it say EDGE?

01:46:45.941 --> 01:46:46.556
Huh?

01:46:47.067 --> 01:46:48.353
It says EDGE!

01:46:48.485 --> 01:46:49.441
What's EDGE?!

01:46:49.528 --> 01:46:51.110
There's no reception.

01:47:02.207 --> 01:47:03.618
What happens if we don't make it?

01:47:03.709 --> 01:47:05.666
And the money we paid?

01:47:05.878 --> 01:47:06.994
We won't make it!

01:47:07.087 --> 01:47:08.794
We want our refund!

01:47:13.093 --> 01:47:14.004
C'mon.

01:47:14.094 --> 01:47:15.255
Did you get it, yet?

01:47:57.763 --> 01:47:58.844
C

01:48:00.766 --> 01:48:01.802
B

01:48:02.017 --> 01:48:03.007
C

01:48:03.268 --> 01:48:04.304
D

01:48:14.989 --> 01:48:17.481
These 3 go to the Bangkapi exam centre.

01:48:17.616 --> 01:48:19.278
These 2 rows to Suttisarn.

01:48:19.451 --> 01:48:20.908
Did you get on, yet?

01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:22.531
Don't forget your helmet!

01:48:23.789 --> 01:48:24.996
Pass it on.

01:48:25.624 --> 01:48:26.831
One set per person!

01:48:27.042 --> 01:48:28.203
We're ready!

01:48:28.293 --> 01:48:29.374
Hurry up!

01:48:29.837 --> 01:48:31.419
Wear your helmet!

01:49:02.119 --> 01:49:03.200
Let's go!

01:49:23.390 --> 01:49:25.097
I'm from the embassy.

01:49:25.184 --> 01:49:27.597
A Thai student confessed
using his phone's dictionary.

01:49:27.686 --> 01:49:29.268
We're resolving the situation.

01:49:29.396 --> 01:49:30.887
What will happen to him?

01:49:31.023 --> 01:49:33.481
They'll probably cancel his scores.

01:49:33.567 --> 01:49:36.560
Worst case, he'll be banned
from the STIC for good.

01:49:36.820 --> 01:49:40.734
They'll question you.
If there isn't anything else, you may leave.

01:49:41.575 --> 01:49:42.565
Just wait here.

01:49:42.659 --> 01:49:44.275
I'm going to talk to them.

01:50:28.497 --> 01:50:29.658
Hold on.

01:50:33.210 --> 01:50:34.542
Is there something?

01:50:55.274 --> 01:50:56.481
Huh?

01:51:01.363 --> 01:51:03.025
May I use the toilet?

01:51:03.115 --> 01:51:04.276
Of course.

01:51:33.729 --> 01:51:34.560
Lynn.

01:51:37.232 --> 01:51:39.064
Mentor Lynn's FC.

01:51:41.236 --> 01:51:42.727
Thanks so much, Lynn.

01:51:45.699 --> 01:51:48.191
We're throwing a party at my place tonight.

01:51:48.285 --> 01:51:49.571
For what?

01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:51.827
Did you know Bank got caught?

01:51:52.331 --> 01:51:55.039
And my scores were cancelled.

01:51:58.629 --> 01:51:59.961
Well...

01:52:00.130 --> 01:52:02.543
we'll look for another exam centre for you.

01:52:03.091 --> 01:52:04.707
If you don't retake the exam,

01:52:04.801 --> 01:52:07.464
you won't be able to apply
to the uni in time.

01:52:08.805 --> 01:52:12.970
Hey, Lynn. You have to retake the exam.

01:52:13.310 --> 01:52:15.393
Please Lynn, pretty please?

01:52:17.981 --> 01:52:19.722
I've changed my mind.

01:52:20.567 --> 01:52:22.775
You've already got the scores you needed.

01:52:27.449 --> 01:52:28.439
But...

01:52:28.533 --> 01:52:30.991
we can't go without you.

01:52:35.916 --> 01:52:37.782
Don't you both know...

01:52:38.669 --> 01:52:41.958
that uni exams aren't multiple choices?

01:52:44.341 --> 01:52:46.549
Even if I went with you...

01:52:46.802 --> 01:52:49.135
you wouldn't be able to copy me.

01:52:54.476 --> 01:52:55.967
I'll find my own ride.

01:53:28.260 --> 01:53:29.751
Where's your boyfriend?

01:53:33.015 --> 01:53:34.381
Where's he?

01:53:39.146 --> 01:53:41.058
I wanted to invite him for dinner.

01:53:46.820 --> 01:53:48.061
So?

01:53:50.824 --> 01:53:53.111
Why didn't you tell me about him?

01:53:59.583 --> 01:54:00.664
Dad...

01:54:00.792 --> 01:54:01.828
Yes?

01:54:04.671 --> 01:54:06.663
I have a confession.

01:54:07.507 --> 01:54:08.964
What is it, honey?

01:54:11.803 --> 01:54:13.089
Tell me.

01:54:26.276 --> 01:54:29.360
Why do you choose to study Education?

01:54:30.113 --> 01:54:31.775
I'd like to be a teacher like my father.

01:54:31.865 --> 01:54:34.733
So, others can benefit the most
from my knowledge.

01:54:35.660 --> 01:54:42.248
Do you have experience in tutoring,
or teaching anyone?

01:54:44.419 --> 01:54:45.660
Yes, I do.

01:55:00.769 --> 01:55:03.432
<i>I scored 1,460 on STIC</i>

01:55:03.522 --> 01:55:07.266
Being a teacher isn't just about academics.

01:55:08.110 --> 01:55:09.442
Do you think...

01:55:09.611 --> 01:55:12.945
you can set a good example in other ways?

01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:25.916
<i>Lynn. Are you coming?</i>

01:55:26.002 --> 01:55:27.334
<i>Bank's taken his share. Come get yours.</i>

01:55:27.421 --> 01:55:28.252
<i>Miss you.</i>

01:55:28.296 --> 01:55:29.878
I'm not going to lie.

01:55:31.508 --> 01:55:34.421
I've done a lot a bad things in the past.

01:55:34.886 --> 01:55:38.129
But I will use them to
teach myself and others.

01:55:39.933 --> 01:55:42.346
<i>Lynn left the chat.</i>

01:56:01.746 --> 01:56:03.578
What a waste.

01:56:04.624 --> 01:56:07.537
You've achieved so much.

01:56:08.295 --> 01:56:11.663
You can apply to scholarships
and study abroad.

01:56:12.215 --> 01:56:14.628
Aren't you interested in any of them?

01:56:16.052 --> 01:56:17.463
I think...

01:56:18.430 --> 01:56:21.514
someone else deserves it more.

01:56:26.313 --> 01:56:31.809
<i>Student Expulsion Letter: Thanaphon Viriyakul</i>

01:57:16.988 --> 01:57:19.526
<i>Bank: Come over to my place tonight.</i>

01:58:04.077 --> 01:58:05.363
Come in.

01:58:11.585 --> 01:58:13.827
The store looks fresh, Little Bank.

01:58:14.296 --> 01:58:16.083
Oops, it's Mister Bank now.

01:58:16.548 --> 01:58:18.039
You laundering money?

01:58:19.551 --> 01:58:21.508
You were expelled from school because...

01:58:21.595 --> 01:58:24.053
the embassy reported you, right?

01:58:25.932 --> 01:58:26.922
Yeah.

01:58:29.269 --> 01:58:31.010
What's next?

01:58:32.564 --> 01:58:34.681
That's the reason why I asked you over.

01:58:37.402 --> 01:58:39.564
Did you apply for the GAT/PAT exams?

01:58:41.656 --> 01:58:44.114
I have a proposition for you.

01:58:48.204 --> 01:58:50.412
I have a fool-proof plan.

01:58:50.540 --> 01:58:51.872
Much safer.

01:58:51.958 --> 01:58:54.075
We can get the answers out to more people.

01:58:54.294 --> 01:58:58.709
More importantly,
there're more GAT/PAT clients than STIC.

01:58:59.674 --> 01:59:00.960
But this plan...

01:59:04.304 --> 01:59:06.671
won't be complete without Mentor Lynn.

01:59:29.746 --> 01:59:31.533
How much more money do you need?

01:59:32.040 --> 01:59:34.327
If your cut isn't enough...

01:59:35.669 --> 01:59:37.331
you can get mine from Pat.

01:59:37.420 --> 01:59:38.456
Go collect it.

01:59:44.344 --> 01:59:45.084
No.

01:59:45.178 --> 01:59:46.168
Wait.

01:59:48.640 --> 01:59:50.472
It's not about the money.

01:59:51.851 --> 01:59:53.092
It's about...

01:59:53.728 --> 01:59:55.139
from now on...

01:59:55.855 --> 01:59:57.596
how much more we can make.

01:59:59.484 --> 02:00:00.600
Lynn.

02:00:02.195 --> 02:00:03.936
I've done the calculations.

02:00:05.448 --> 02:00:06.780
This round...

02:00:07.701 --> 02:00:09.533
there's at least 10 million in it.

02:00:10.203 --> 02:00:13.867
Don't you think it's worth the risk again?

02:00:15.917 --> 02:00:17.249
You've seen it.

02:00:17.335 --> 02:00:21.170
If we get caught, we wouldn't go to jail.

02:00:25.343 --> 02:00:26.208
Lynn.

02:00:27.220 --> 02:00:30.839
Are you gonna study 4 years
for a 5 figure salary?

02:00:31.266 --> 02:00:34.304
You can earn millions, starting today.

02:00:35.186 --> 02:00:37.724
Why work at a stupid desk job?

02:00:48.324 --> 02:00:50.111
Because for me...

02:00:50.535 --> 02:00:52.572
no amount of money is worth it.

02:01:02.005 --> 02:01:02.995
Lynn.

02:01:04.924 --> 02:01:06.586
If you won't do this...

02:01:08.344 --> 02:01:11.837
I'll tell everyone
you're the mastermind of the STIC scandal.

02:01:12.223 --> 02:01:13.054
I guarantee.

02:01:13.141 --> 02:01:15.804
You'll be banned from
studying abroad like me.

02:01:23.276 --> 02:01:24.266
Fine.

02:01:24.986 --> 02:01:26.693
We are even then.

02:01:29.491 --> 02:01:31.232
It won't just be you!

02:01:31.451 --> 02:01:32.362
Grace,

02:01:32.452 --> 02:01:33.442
Pat,

02:01:33.578 --> 02:01:36.366
and all the clients who took the STIC too.

02:01:36.915 --> 02:01:38.122
Think about it...

02:01:38.208 --> 02:01:39.449
if the board finds out,

02:01:39.542 --> 02:01:41.909
they'll cancel all the scores in Thailand.

02:01:54.849 --> 02:01:56.340
One last thing...

02:01:58.353 --> 02:02:00.595
your dad will be so disappointed in you.

02:02:02.565 --> 02:02:04.101
Don't be afraid, honey.

02:02:06.694 --> 02:02:08.981
We'll get through this, no matter what.

02:02:10.031 --> 02:02:11.488
Smile.

02:02:12.867 --> 02:02:14.904
Smile like me.

02:02:32.470 --> 02:02:34.177
<i>You once told me...</i>

02:02:35.932 --> 02:02:37.719
if we win, we'll win together.

02:02:38.309 --> 02:02:40.426
If we lose, then we'll all lose together.

02:02:42.146 --> 02:02:44.559
I won't be the only one taking all the blame.

02:02:45.483 --> 02:02:46.894
If you won't do it,

02:02:47.110 --> 02:02:49.477
I'll make sure you go down with me!

02:02:57.036 --> 02:02:58.277
What do you say, Lynn?

02:03:01.624 --> 02:03:02.990
What's it going to be?

02:03:05.086 --> 02:03:06.577
Everything is up to you now.

02:03:13.553 --> 02:03:14.589
You're right.

02:03:14.679 --> 02:03:16.341
Everything is up to me.
