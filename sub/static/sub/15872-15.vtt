00:00.760 --> 00:03.820
A few months ago,I discovered
I had a twin sister.

00:03.820 --> 00:07.390
And then she she asked me to
take her place,keep the secret,

00:07.390 --> 00:10.670
find our real mother
and try to stay alive.

00:11.030 --> 00:12.640
Put yourself in my shoes.

00:12.640 --> 00:15.510
How long could you
keep up the lying game?

00:15.510 --> 00:17.310
Previously on The Lying game:

00:17.310 --> 00:19.280
- Hey,Derek!
- What do you want from me?

00:19.280 --> 00:20.870
Someone thinks I am dead.

00:20.870 --> 00:24.690
We can't risk being seen together,
and until this cut on my head heals,

00:24.690 --> 00:26.070
you need to keep being me.

00:26.070 --> 00:27.550
What the hell's going
on with you and Rebecca?

00:27.550 --> 00:30.850
You're dating now? If can keep
her close,I can keep her happy.

00:30.850 --> 00:32.509
I'm just hoping the glass slipper fits.

00:32.509 --> 00:36.110
That surgery is one of my deepest regrets,
and I haven't made a mistake like that since.

00:36.110 --> 00:38.490
I'm gonna lose Laurel,aren't I?

00:38.900 --> 00:40.600
- You're not our mother.
- You're in danger.

00:40.600 --> 00:42.900
The man who climbed out
of the lake that night...

00:42.900 --> 00:44.460
I grabbed his arm,but he wouldn't help.

00:44.460 --> 00:46.860
- What did he look like?
- Snake.

00:46.860 --> 00:48.420
Trust me,Kristin,it was not your fault.

00:48.420 --> 00:51.320
How do I know there's not something
else you're not telling me?

00:51.320 --> 00:55.530
Oh,Annie... what have you done now?

01:08.860 --> 01:13.030
Hey,Sutton,so I've been
and it occurred to me...

01:13.030 --> 01:16.570
Have you seen my taupe blouse?
The one with the gold polka dots?

01:16.570 --> 01:20.580
We just found out
asking me about a blouse?

01:20.580 --> 01:22.230
and you're Aren't you
the least bit upset?

01:22.230 --> 01:25.750
I am the one who spent the last
few months chasing a dead end.

01:25.750 --> 01:28.350
"Upset" does not even
begin to describe it.

01:28.830 --> 01:31.110
Does anyone knock around here?

01:31.110 --> 01:32.500
Fresh towels.

01:33.240 --> 01:34.610
Well,I'm kind of in the
middle of something here.

01:34.610 --> 01:37.260
Is that Ethan? It's a shame
he had to leave the ball early.

01:37.260 --> 01:40.060
Is he still running a
fever? What is that saying?

01:40.060 --> 01:42.110
Starve a cold,feed a
fever. Feed a fever...

01:42.110 --> 01:43.860
Mother.

01:44.720 --> 01:48.090
Right. Feel better,Ethan.

01:51.860 --> 01:54.440
- "Feel better,Ethan"?
- What was I supposed to say?

01:54.440 --> 01:57.280
That he left so he could
jump into bed with you?

01:57.280 --> 01:59.270
Sutton,we haven't...

01:59.270 --> 02:02.990
Yeah,I keep forgetting. Bye,sis.

02:12.560 --> 02:16.060
- Hey,that's my top.
- You said I could borrow it.

02:16.350 --> 02:18.900
- Well,I changed my mind.
- I need to look good today.

02:18.900 --> 02:21.810
I'm single again now that Justin's
officially out of the picture.

02:21.810 --> 02:25.070
Oh,please,you're much better
off without that creep.

02:25.070 --> 02:26.060
Hey,Sutton.

02:26.060 --> 02:29.700
No,she's right. I deserve
better. I'm moving on.

02:29.700 --> 02:30.640
You are?

02:30.640 --> 02:33.290
I thought of all people,you'd
be happy to hear that.

02:33.290 --> 02:35.930
I think it's a very mature decision.

02:35.930 --> 02:39.650
Absolutely. Gold star for Laurel.

02:40.520 --> 02:43.930
- Sutton.
- Oh,come on. It's a joke.

02:48.800 --> 02:52.460
- Is it me,or is Sutton just...
- Midterms this week.

02:52.700 --> 02:54.810
Only going to get worse.

02:58.860 --> 03:00.600
You're sure Kristin didn't see you?

03:00.600 --> 03:02.580
Sutton made her think
she was talking to you.

03:02.580 --> 03:04.170
All right. That can't happen again.

03:04.170 --> 03:06.230
I agree. You've got to be more careful.

03:06.230 --> 03:09.650
Me? You should have heard
Sutton talking to Kristin.

03:09.650 --> 03:12.150
If anyone's going to
blow our cover,it's her.

03:12.150 --> 03:15.100
Nice to know you have
so much faith in me.

03:18.040 --> 03:20.740
Well,looks like the gang's all here.

03:20.740 --> 03:23.090
We're going to need their help
finding our real birth mother.

03:23.090 --> 03:25.640
I'm not ready to throw
myself back into that.

03:25.640 --> 03:29.020
I don't... want to get
my heart broken again.

03:29.020 --> 03:30.240
Annie said that we were still in danger.

03:30.240 --> 03:35.090
So,whatever she knows has something
to do with what happened to you.

03:35.090 --> 03:36.050
Emma's right,okay?

03:36.050 --> 03:39.700
You guys weren't in any kind of danger until
you started searching for your birth mom.

03:39.700 --> 03:45.300
Annie Hobbs,your mom,that note,what happened in your car
- this is all connected.

04:10.160 --> 04:12.840
Well,they weren't actual braces.

04:13.620 --> 04:16.029
That was more of a corrective retainer.

04:16.570 --> 04:19.610
Okay. I gotta go.
I'll see you soon. Bye.

04:20.730 --> 04:22.880
- Good morning,Dad.
- Morning,honey.

04:23.240 --> 04:25.910
Isn't it a little early to be
talking to this Bryan character?

04:25.910 --> 04:26.930
It's Ryan.

04:26.930 --> 04:28.810
You've got your
midterms this week,honey.

04:28.810 --> 04:29.910
Your grades this semester are gonna...

04:29.910 --> 04:33.600
Can make or break my chances of
getting into a good college. I get it.

04:33.600 --> 04:36.060
See? Brain food.

04:36.570 --> 04:39.260
- Orange juice.
- Thank you.

04:41.670 --> 04:43.000
<i>****</i>

04:43.310 --> 04:47.120
Oh,isn't it a little early to be
talking to this Rebecca character?

04:47.850 --> 04:49.490
Go to school.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.980
- Have a good day.
- thank you

04:52.980 --> 04:53.620
Hi there.

04:53.620 --> 04:57.040
So... remind me,are the
Finnegans still married?

04:57.040 --> 05:00.150
Because Betsy's on the membership
committee at Chelsea Creek.

05:00.150 --> 05:03.340
And I don't want to step on any
land mines during my interview today.

05:03.340 --> 05:06.280
You know what? Ask her
about her rose bushes.

05:06.280 --> 05:08.270
The woman is obsessed with gardening.

05:08.270 --> 05:12.400
So tell me do you think they're prejudiced
against single women joing the club?

05:12.400 --> 05:14.500
Because they're really
making me jump through hoops.

05:14.500 --> 05:17.300
I'll call my friend Doug
Mancino. He's the club president.

05:17.300 --> 05:19.570
- You'd do that for me?
- Of course.

05:19.570 --> 05:21.330
What are old friends for?

05:21.590 --> 05:24.600
Oh,is that what we are? Friends?

05:24.600 --> 05:27.290
When did it become so important
for you to join a club?

05:27.820 --> 05:30.800
I always thought you were
more of a free spirit.

05:30.800 --> 05:34.300
Well,let's just say that
membership has its privileges.

05:34.300 --> 05:35.680
Such as what?

05:35.680 --> 05:38.040
Spending more time with you.

05:38.040 --> 05:41.560
- You don't mince words,do you?
- No,I don't.

05:41.560 --> 05:44.240
Okay. You're in the driver's seat.

05:44.240 --> 05:48.170
- What happens now?
- I ask you to dinner.

05:48.170 --> 05:50.300
How's Wednesday?

05:53.590 --> 05:57.200
Annie Hobbs said that she saw a dark-haired
man swim out from the lake,right?

05:57.200 --> 05:59.250
Half the guys in
Scottsdale have dark hair.

05:59.250 --> 06:02.740
She said something last night at
the hospital about a snake,rember?

06:02.740 --> 06:06.470
Maybe we should be looking
for someone named Snake.

06:06.470 --> 06:09.040
- A nickname.
- No.

06:09.400 --> 06:11.070
Maybe it's someone from Arroyo.

06:11.070 --> 06:13.640
Whoever sent that note to Emma
knows your "lying game" M.O.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.890
Yeah,but I don't have any...

06:16.600 --> 06:19.870
- Sutton doesn't have...
- Enemies? Yeah.

06:19.870 --> 06:22.160
But I don't think anybody at
school would want to killme.

06:22.160 --> 06:24.560
Has anyone at school been acting
weird these past few weeks?

06:24.560 --> 06:29.060
Derek's been avoiding me,but I just assumed
it was because of the whole Char breakup.

06:29.060 --> 06:31.020
Okay,Derek is a stoner and a moron.

06:31.020 --> 06:33.260
I can't imagine that he would
figure out that there's two of us.

06:33.260 --> 06:35.830
Yes,but he has been trading
all those phone calls with Alec.

06:35.830 --> 06:38.380
And Alec knows about Annie Hobbs.

06:38.380 --> 06:40.030
That can't just be a coincidence.

06:40.030 --> 06:43.310
Guys,my dad is not involved
in any of this,okay?

06:43.310 --> 06:45.000
I got to get to school.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.390
- I'll check out Derek.
- I'm coming with.

06:49.290 --> 06:51.450
Are you gonna be okay here?

07:12.140 --> 07:13.410
Good news.

07:13.410 --> 07:17.320
I managed to spring two tickets to
the Slow Train gig on Wednesday night.

07:18.900 --> 07:20.660
Wednesday,as in tomorrow?

07:20.660 --> 07:23.800
Last minute,I know,but
they're playing Hangar 19.

07:23.800 --> 07:25.110
It's gonna be epic.

07:25.110 --> 07:27.180
Oh,my chem midterm is Thursday.

07:27.180 --> 07:31.340
And you and I have chemistry.
It's,it's perfect... synergy.

07:33.490 --> 07:36.430
Seriously,my dad's been
on my case about midterms.

07:36.430 --> 07:38.290
There's no way he'll let me go.

07:38.290 --> 07:42.010
Hey,Mads. Hey,Ryan.

07:42.010 --> 07:44.740
We,uh,we'll talk later.

07:44.740 --> 07:46.270
Sutton.

07:48.700 --> 07:51.140
Can you believe that
it's midterms already?

07:51.140 --> 07:52.290
We're studying together,right?

07:52.290 --> 07:54.780
Actually,I gonna need you to
cover for me tomorrow night.

07:54.780 --> 07:56.960
If my dad asks,I'm studying
at the library with you.

07:56.960 --> 08:00.040
And what are you actually
going to be doing?

08:03.780 --> 08:06.080
Don't tell me you're
going out with Ryan again.

08:06.080 --> 08:09.560
You really have it in
for that guy,don't you?

08:09.810 --> 08:12.800
Did something else happen
between you guys in ninth grade?

08:13.140 --> 08:16.230
I just think that you
can do much better.

08:18.710 --> 08:24.480
But if you're so into
him,then,yes,I will be your alibi.

08:24.480 --> 08:26.640
Thank you.

08:34.700 --> 08:36.710
- See you.
- See you.

08:40.730 --> 08:42.159
Justin?

08:42.159 --> 08:44.010
I thought we were moving on.

08:44.010 --> 08:46.130
Yeah,might've stretched the truth a bit.

08:46.130 --> 08:48.650
Mm-hmm,just enough so
you could keep seeing him.

08:48.650 --> 08:50.840
School's the only place
we can be together;

08:50.840 --> 08:54.240
I've tried sneaking out at night to see
him, but Mom's been watching me like a hawk.

08:54.240 --> 08:57.120
Have you learned nothing from me?

08:57.250 --> 08:58.950
Lie.

08:59.830 --> 09:01.670
I thought lies were a thing of the past.

09:01.670 --> 09:04.630
- Well,the past is the new future.
- That makes no sense.

09:04.630 --> 09:08.680
No,what makes no sense is
that you are still with Justin.

09:08.680 --> 09:11.250
You really trust him
after all that he did?

09:11.250 --> 09:15.070
He loves me... and I believe him.

09:16.420 --> 09:21.270
Keep telling yourself that,and maybe
one day you actually will believe it.

09:27.390 --> 09:28.890
Oh,come on.

09:28.890 --> 09:31.790
Try the ml? e attack when you're
stuck in the corner like that.

09:33.690 --> 09:35.030
There you go.

09:35.160 --> 09:37.070
How'd you know that?

09:37.070 --> 09:39.610
Uh,one of the foster families
I stayed with had an Xbox,

09:39.610 --> 09:43.100
and I've been stuck in this cabin
for three days with nothing to do.

09:44.700 --> 09:46.230
Want to go
head-to-head?

09:49.420 --> 09:51.680
How many foster families have you had?

09:51.940 --> 09:55.720
Twelve. Well,13,counting the Mercers.

09:55.720 --> 09:58.740
What was that like,bouncing
from place to place?

10:01.130 --> 10:06.730
you just learn not to get too
attached to things... or people.

10:07.080 --> 10:09.710
Although sometimes it's hard not to.

10:11.030 --> 10:14.570
It's so crazy that I finally
land with this amazing family,

10:14.570 --> 10:16.240
you know,find my real sister...

10:16.240 --> 10:21.120
and now all this:
Sutton's back,the hiding...

10:22.210 --> 10:25.730
someone out there trying to kill us.

10:26.890 --> 10:30.900
I shouldn't have accused you of having
something to do with Sutton's disappearance.

10:33.270 --> 10:36.190
That's okay. You
weren't thinking clearly.

10:36.190 --> 10:39.760
- None of us were.
- Yeah,but still,it wasn't right.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.200
If Mads went missing and someone blamed
me, I'd come at them with both guns blazing.

10:44.630 --> 10:47.390
Like... this?

10:51.370 --> 10:54.840
And that,my friend,is
how we do it in Sin City.

10:56.700 --> 10:58.850
oh,man.

11:02.010 --> 11:06.430
It's so bizarre because of Emma, all my
teachers think I'm going to ace my midterms.

11:06.430 --> 11:07.650
You'll do fine.

11:07.990 --> 11:11.600
It's like I'm living in this parallel
universe,where I'm a total egghead.

11:12.230 --> 11:13.670
There's Derek.

11:17.300 --> 11:18.950
Oh,my God.

11:19.730 --> 11:21.290
The snake.

11:23.490 --> 11:25.410
It was him.

11:31.530 --> 11:33.540
Dude,I'm just trying
to ask you a question ¨C

11:33.540 --> 11:37.030
- I want to know where you were the night of Sutton's party.
- What the hell difference does it make?

11:44.620 --> 11:47.610
I was home,okay?
What's your problem,man?

11:47.610 --> 11:50.720
Rogers. Get to class.
You,too,Whitehorse.

12:00.360 --> 12:03.040
- He's not copping to anything.
- It was him.

12:03.140 --> 12:07.600
His tattoo
- that's the snake that Annie Hobbs was talking about,it has to be.

12:07.600 --> 12:11.880
After fourth period,we'll
talk to him together,all right?

12:13.250 --> 12:15.150
That's the worst idea ever.

12:15.150 --> 12:17.450
Why can't you just tell them
that we're back together?

12:17.450 --> 12:19.520
Speaking of "worst idea ever.

12:19.520 --> 12:22.420
" I just don't like
sneaking around and hiding.

12:22.580 --> 12:23.870
If your parents caught us,th...

12:23.870 --> 12:25.670
They'd be furious.

12:26.640 --> 12:29.310
And I can't say I blame them. I mean...

12:29.620 --> 12:31.950
we all know what you came here to do.

12:34.030 --> 12:35.640
That's your parents.

12:37.170 --> 12:40.320
But we're okay,right?

12:43.340 --> 12:46.640
I just... want to be with you,Laurel.

12:46.640 --> 12:48.560
I want that,too.

12:48.830 --> 12:53.050
But... you're the last person my
mom or dad wants me dating right now,

12:53.050 --> 12:57.230
and that's something we're
gonna have to deal with,so...

12:57.390 --> 13:01.380
we continue to sneak around... and lie.

13:02.210 --> 13:03.470
Fine.

13:04.130 --> 13:06.220
If that's what it's gonna take...

13:06.930 --> 13:08.880
I'm in.

13:16.710 --> 13:18.430
I don't see him.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.770
Mrs. Ihrig. Have you seen Derek Rogers?

13:22.770 --> 13:25.880
He went home early.
Food poisoning,I think.

13:35.230 --> 13:38.010
Yes,I understand the need
for patient confidentiality.

13:38.010 --> 13:40.630
It's-it's just that I would
sleep so much better knowing that

13:40.630 --> 13:42.870
Annie made it back to the clinic safely.

13:42.870 --> 13:45.760
I was her nurse at the
hospital here in Scottsdale.

13:45.760 --> 13:51.060
And such a sweet lady
- it would just mean so much if you could just check for me?

13:51.570 --> 13:54.300
I would so appreciate
that. Yes,I'll hold.

13:54.300 --> 13:55.510
Rebecca,hi.

13:55.510 --> 13:57.670
- Oh,you're on the phone.
- Oh,that's all right.

13:57.830 --> 13:59.140
No,it's okay.

13:59.140 --> 14:02.030
I just had my membership interview,so...

14:02.030 --> 14:05.220
Gosh,you'd think I was applying
to Harvard or something.

14:06.020 --> 14:09.420
Is everything okay? You
seem a little distracted.

14:09.420 --> 14:12.090
Sorry,I've got teenage trouble.

14:12.090 --> 14:12.870
Sutton?

14:12.870 --> 14:17.330
Rebellious and stubborn one day,and
the next day, rebellious and stubborn.

14:17.330 --> 14:18.970
Hello,ladies.

14:19.670 --> 14:20.600
Hi,Rebecca. How are you?

14:20.600 --> 14:22.730
- Good. How are you?
- I'm good.

14:24.010 --> 14:26.380
- How was the interview?
- It went well.

14:26.920 --> 14:30.540
Perennials and-and
annuals and tulip bulbs.

14:30.540 --> 14:32.370
Very well,thanks to you.

14:32.370 --> 14:34.990
It seems flattery is
getting you everywhere,huh?

14:36.040 --> 14:37.870
- See you later?
- Bye.

14:41.660 --> 14:46.860
So... you and Alec.
I'm just so surprised.

14:46.860 --> 14:49.940
I mean,after the way he
treated you in high school.

14:49.940 --> 14:53.650
Well,I'm... not the same
girl that I was back then.

14:54.420 --> 14:59.090
And between you and me,it's kind of
a thrill to be back and turning heads.

15:01.050 --> 15:03.260
Have a nice lunch.

15:10.780 --> 15:13.660
Sutton... we can handle this.

15:13.660 --> 15:15.040
Why don't you go wait in the car.

15:15.040 --> 15:18.410
No. He tried to kill me,remember?

15:26.270 --> 15:27.690
Is Derek here?

15:27.690 --> 15:30.290
If you're looking to buy
drugs,you've come to the wrong place.

15:30.290 --> 15:32.610
No,I-I'm...

15:32.730 --> 15:37.170
He,uh,missed some classes,and
I brought his homework.

15:37.170 --> 15:40.560
Homework? You're kidding.

15:45.220 --> 15:47.230
You're friends of Derek's?

15:47.230 --> 15:50.440
Uh,he... used to date my friend,Char,

15:50.440 --> 15:53.690
and broke up with her
out of the blue,and,uh...

15:54.160 --> 15:57.780
didn't show up for my birthday
party two Saturdays ago,so...

15:57.780 --> 15:59.900
He said he was with you,but now
I don't know what to believe.

15:59.900 --> 16:01.330
We're just really worried about him.

16:01.330 --> 16:04.530
A week ago Saturday,that was the
night his car broke down at the lake.

16:04.530 --> 16:07.860
- The lake?
- Howley Lake. He got a ride home with that cop.

16:07.860 --> 16:10.780
When the police car pulled up,I
just assumed he'd been busted again.

16:10.780 --> 16:12.120
Do you rember which one?

16:12.120 --> 16:16.660
Oh,believe me,I've met 'em all; he was the nice one
- Dan... something.

16:16.660 --> 16:19.110
- Whitehorse?
- Yeah,that's it.

16:19.110 --> 16:21.050
Dan Whitehorse.

16:30.530 --> 16:33.500
And she was sure it was  Dan
who took him home that night?

16:33.500 --> 16:38.380
Apparently,Derek's mom is on a first-name
basis with half of Scottsdale's finest.

16:38.770 --> 16:40.860
Guy's spent more time
in juvie than you have.

16:41.630 --> 16:43.650
I'm gonna head home. I'll talk to Dan.

16:43.650 --> 16:45.100
I'll come with you.

16:45.100 --> 16:47.470
He's not gonna say anything
to me if you're there.

16:47.470 --> 16:49.180
Well,I need to do something.

16:49.180 --> 16:51.290
- Don't you have midterms this week?
- Yes.

16:51.290 --> 16:54.590
And thank you so much for setting
up those monster expectations.

16:54.590 --> 16:58.030
I can't even think about school when Derek's out there
- he tried to kill me.

16:58.030 --> 16:59.770
I need to find out why.

17:00.270 --> 17:05.510
Okay... you go find
Derek. I'll take the tests.

17:05.829 --> 17:06.900
Emma...

17:06.900 --> 17:08.900
No,Sutton's right; she needs
to be the one to confront him,

17:08.900 --> 17:12.220
and I'm already up on all
the classes,so it makes sense.

17:12.220 --> 17:13.710
You would do that for me?

17:13.710 --> 17:17.150
Wait a minute,this isn't your way of
just,like,getting back into the house?

17:17.150 --> 17:19.829
If you fail midterms,our
cover is potentially blown.

17:19.829 --> 17:22.720
This will just buy us more time.

17:24.460 --> 17:29.810
Well,then in that case...
... you'll need this.

17:50.500 --> 17:52.060
We could take her car away,right?

17:52.060 --> 17:54.120
The cell phone. Ground her.

17:54.120 --> 17:57.380
How many times have we
said that? It isn't working.

17:57.840 --> 18:03.080
I think we should start treating her like an adult, tell
her how it's making us feel, what it's actually doing to us.

18:03.080 --> 18:05.210
Yeah,that sounds a
little touch-feely to me.

18:05.210 --> 18:07.590
Like anything you
suggest has been working?

18:07.590 --> 18:09.870
This isn't about Sutton,is it?

18:10.720 --> 18:14.830
Hey,guys. Smells amazing!

18:15.590 --> 18:19.110
Yeah,not so fast,young lady. Your
mother and I want to talk to you.

18:21.420 --> 18:25.210
- Uh,okay.
- It's about the way you've been behaving lately.

18:36.980 --> 18:39.620
We know you've been under a
lot of pressure with midterms,

18:39.620 --> 18:42.850
but when you are short
with your father or me,

18:42.850 --> 18:46.690
it makes us feel like
you disrespect us,and...

18:46.690 --> 18:51.480
personally... it hurts my feelings.

18:54.300 --> 18:58.050
I'm sorry... that I
made you feel that way.

18:58.050 --> 19:01.100
I have so much respect
for both you and Dad.

19:02.720 --> 19:05.450
You have no idea.

19:05.450 --> 19:07.300
Yeah,well,you have a
funny way of showing it.

19:07.300 --> 19:13.370
Look,I know I can
be...difficult sometimes,

19:13.370 --> 19:16.830
but I care about you guys so much.

19:16.830 --> 19:21.030
I am so lucky to have you as my parents.

19:21.370 --> 19:23.750
I'm sorry.

19:31.890 --> 19:35.440
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right. ...

19:51.650 --> 19:53.170
Thank you.

19:59.590 --> 20:01.800
If it isn't little
Miss Multi-Hyphenate.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.640
Singer-slash-
violinist,right?

20:04.640 --> 20:05.960
Something like that.

20:06.390 --> 20:08.620
You should get up there. It's open mike.

20:08.770 --> 20:10.730
I prefer to lurk.

20:10.730 --> 20:11.810
I liked your song,by the way.

20:11.810 --> 20:14.300
Oh,thanks. Something's
off with the bridge.

20:14.300 --> 20:18.710
Maybe that last chord should be an A-suspended
seventh and not an A-suspended fourth.

20:19.260 --> 20:20.700
Would you mind if I join you?

20:23.040 --> 20:24.540
Hey,guys.

20:27.380 --> 20:29.340
Nice job up there.

20:30.550 --> 20:33.900
I'm,uh,Justin,Laurel's boyfriend.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.900
Baz. Your girlfriend and
I were just talking music.

20:36.900 --> 20:39.070
She's got a hell of an ear.

20:40.520 --> 20:41.740
It's getting late.

20:41.740 --> 20:44.580
I should get you home before your
parents start wondering where you are.

20:45.330 --> 20:46.850
Nice to meet you.

20:47.900 --> 20:50.840
- See ya.
- See ya.

20:55.920 --> 20:58.540
Thank you again for
letting me copy your notes.

20:58.540 --> 21:01.520
These last few days have been a blur.

21:02.420 --> 21:05.980
It's good to see you two taking
your midterms seriously this year.

21:06.340 --> 21:08.620
Sutton has all A's this semester.

21:08.620 --> 21:11.100
Is that right? That's impressive.

21:11.100 --> 21:13.460
You need anything,let me know,okay?

21:15.240 --> 21:19.570
Hey,are we still on to study
tomorrow night at the library?

21:21.200 --> 21:22.660
You're not backing out,are you?

21:22.660 --> 21:24.130
No.

21:24.360 --> 21:26.410
Wh... What time did we say again?

21:26.410 --> 21:27.830
Seven.

21:27.830 --> 21:31.770
Seven. Yes,I will be there.

21:36.080 --> 21:37.340
Dan.

21:38.320 --> 21:41.710
What were you doing giving Derek Rogers
a ride home the night of Sutton's party?

21:41.710 --> 21:43.570
Kid's car broke down.

21:44.440 --> 21:46.830
Found him on the side of the
road looking like a drowned rat.

21:46.830 --> 21:48.050
By the lake?

21:48.050 --> 21:50.820
He was hitching a ride in the
rain. What's with the interrogation?

21:50.820 --> 21:53.480
The Mercer car went
into the lake that night.

21:53.480 --> 21:56.250
Did it not occur to you that
there might be a connection there?

21:56.250 --> 21:58.160
Of course it did.

21:58.900 --> 22:01.800
But then you and Sutton came up
with this-this joyriding story.

22:01.800 --> 22:05.340
So why reopen a case
that's already been closed?

22:06.610 --> 22:10.790
Unless-unless you've got some new information
that would make us want to reopen the case?

22:16.020 --> 22:19.460
No. I guess not.

22:36.830 --> 22:39.230
I come bearing kung pao chicken.

22:39.380 --> 22:41.680
Brown rice,no onions.

22:45.050 --> 22:46.740
Are you online friends with Derek?

22:46.740 --> 22:49.470
Emma must have friended
him when he was dating Char.

22:49.470 --> 22:51.770
He hasn't updated his
status since yesterday.

22:53.570 --> 22:57.420
I can't believe that I'm stuck in
here,and she's back living my life.

22:57.420 --> 22:58.620
Let me see this.

23:00.580 --> 23:01.150
{a6}<i>****</i>

22:58.620 --> 23:01.150
Hey,what is the deal with guys and cars?

23:01.150 --> 23:04.620
I don't know,but apparently Derek
spends a lot of time at this body shop.

23:05.810 --> 23:07.720
I think we should go there
now,see if we can find him.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.710
Well,Ethan's gonna stop by after school.

23:09.710 --> 23:11.460
So,he can take me.

23:11.460 --> 23:14.510
Sutton,come on,you really think he's going
to fall for this damsel in distress act?

23:14.510 --> 23:17.720
Act? I'm sorry,last time I
checked,somebody tried to kill me.

23:17.720 --> 23:20.570
So you put the moves on Ethan while
Emma's studying for your midterms.

23:20.570 --> 23:22.500
Hey,she offered.

23:22.630 --> 23:24.160
Probably to get the
hell out of this place.

23:24.160 --> 23:25.530
She's doing it for you.

23:25.530 --> 23:29.710
No,she's doing it so she can prove,yet again,
that she's better at being me than I am.

23:29.710 --> 23:31.350
All she ever wanted was a real family.

23:31.350 --> 23:33.650
Yeah,unfortunately,it's mine.

23:37.020 --> 23:38.850
Bye.

23:41.130 --> 23:42.740
You know what?

23:42.920 --> 23:45.720
When we get to the other side of this, I
think you should get to know Emma better.

23:45.720 --> 23:50.120
Let me guess. Because I
could learn so much from her?

23:50.120 --> 23:52.420
Yeah,well,now that you
mention it,actually,you could.

24:00.740 --> 24:02.030
Hey,Alec,you got a minute?

24:02.030 --> 24:04.300
I got lots of minutes; what's up,Dan?

24:04.300 --> 24:09.260
That kid,Derek Rogers,I think he may have had
something to do with the Mercer car going missing.

24:09.920 --> 24:11.220
Oh,yeah?

24:11.220 --> 24:13.320
Last I checked,that case was closed.

24:13.320 --> 24:14.900
I think we should reopen it.

24:14.900 --> 24:18.940
Really? Didn't your brother and
Sutton drive that car into the lake?

24:20.180 --> 24:23.430
Uh,from the very beginning,I
thought they were lying about that.

24:23.430 --> 24:25.980
What makes you think Derek
Rogers has anything to do with it?

24:25.980 --> 24:28.330
That night,by the lake,I
gave him a ride home.

24:28.330 --> 24:31.460
He said his car broke down, but I think
we should bring him in for questioning.

24:31.460 --> 24:35.350
Sure,do what you want,but I
can't bring that case to trial.

24:35.350 --> 24:37.260
Not when there's a confession on record.

24:37.260 --> 24:39.200
I still think we should bring him in.

24:39.200 --> 24:41.250
I wouldn't get hung up on it,Dan.

24:43.890 --> 24:46.260
You'd be wasting your time.

24:56.350 --> 24:57.940
{a6}<i>********</i>

25:04.280 --> 25:07.720
Good thing your dad changed his mind
about letting you come out tonight.

25:07.720 --> 25:10.620
Actually,he has no idea that I'm here.

25:10.620 --> 25:12.280
Thinks I'm studying with Sutton.

25:12.280 --> 25:14.950
Ah,subterfuge.

25:14.950 --> 25:17.610
Your good friend Sutton's idea,no doubt.

25:17.610 --> 25:20.440
Oh,it's no big deal. We cover
for each other all the time.

25:20.440 --> 25:23.630
And you're sure you can
trust her not to say anything?

25:23.630 --> 25:26.890
She's my best friend.
She'd never rat me out.

25:27.500 --> 25:28.600
Come on.

25:46.260 --> 25:48.810
- Hello?
- Alec,hi,it's Sutton.

25:48.810 --> 25:52.650
- Is Mads there?
- Isn't she with you?

25:52.650 --> 25:55.550
No,she hasn't shown up yet,and
she's not picking up her cell.

25:55.550 --> 25:57.170
Well,she left here awhile ago.

25:57.170 --> 25:59.620
Hm,well,maybe she just
stopped to grab some food.

25:59.620 --> 26:01.920
I'll hang out here another half hour.

26:02.650 --> 26:04.540
Okay,well,do me a favor.

26:04.540 --> 26:07.250
Whether she shows up or
not,you call me either way,okay?

26:07.250 --> 26:10.530
Of course. Bye.

26:19.160 --> 26:20.900
- Hello?
- Rebecca,it's Alec.

26:20.900 --> 26:24.030
Uh,I'm sorry to have to
cancel. Something's come up.

26:31.390 --> 26:33.950
Shop's closed. Come back tomorrow.

26:42.560 --> 26:43.580
What are you doing here?

26:43.580 --> 26:47.470
Well,I want to know what you were
doing in the backseat of my car.

26:48.910 --> 26:51.240
Got no idea what you're talking about.

26:51.370 --> 26:54.760
The night I went into the
lake. You tried to kill me.

26:54.760 --> 26:56.850
I was at home that night.

27:01.090 --> 27:03.170
Now,if you don't mind?

27:07.500 --> 27:09.870
We know Dan picked you up by the lake.

27:09.870 --> 27:12.350
What if he did? I went for a walk.

27:14.750 --> 27:16.220
Stop lying to me.

27:16.220 --> 27:20.190
All right,but it didn't go down
like it was supposed to,okay?

27:20.910 --> 27:23.660
I didn't want to hurt you. I was just
supposed to take you to a parking lot,

27:23.660 --> 27:25.820
but you freaked out,then
the car went over.

27:25.820 --> 27:28.350
Then when I saw you in
school,that you were okay...

27:30.450 --> 27:33.200
You swam out of the lake,and
you just left her there?

27:33.200 --> 27:33.940
I panicked.

27:33.940 --> 27:36.470
You were working for someone;
who told you to get in that car?

27:36.470 --> 27:37.940
They tell you to send the note,too?

27:37.940 --> 27:38.980
Note? What note?

27:38.980 --> 27:41.130
Who sent you?!

27:42.000 --> 27:45.070
- I can't.
- Derek,tell us!

27:57.560 --> 28:00.320
Oh,my God. Someone's coming.

28:00.320 --> 28:04.030
Come on,let's go,get
out of here right now..

28:25.040 --> 28:27.450
Don't say a word,all right?

28:27.900 --> 28:29.330
I've got this.

28:30.130 --> 28:32.620
License and registration.

28:34.600 --> 28:37.720
- Ethan?
- Harry.

28:38.400 --> 28:40.330
What seems to be the problem?

28:40.330 --> 28:42.700
You've got a taillight out.

28:45.030 --> 28:47.000
What happened there?

28:47.730 --> 28:53.150
I was putting new brake pads on my
bike and scraped my hand on the chain.

28:54.530 --> 28:55.490
Here.

28:55.490 --> 28:56.700
Ah,don't worry about it.

28:56.700 --> 29:00.960
Just get the taillight fixed,and you
might want to have that hand looked at.

29:00.960 --> 29:03.640
- Will do.
- Night.

29:13.950 --> 29:15.620
Alec.

29:16.260 --> 29:18.510
Rebecca? What a surprise.

29:18.510 --> 29:20.790
Didn't you say you had
to stay close to home?

29:22.330 --> 29:26.290
Yeah. I was just getting
something out of my car.

29:26.370 --> 29:28.860
- What's all that?
- Well,I picked up dinner.

29:28.860 --> 29:31.380
I thought I'd keep you company
while you wait for Mads.

29:31.430 --> 29:33.140
How nice.

29:33.470 --> 29:35.430
- Come in.
- Okay.

29:35.430 --> 29:38.430
- You look like you could use a drink.
- Do I?

29:38.430 --> 29:41.440
So,has Mads done this before? No.

29:41.940 --> 29:44.860
That's the strange thing. She's
been such a good kid,you know?

29:45.660 --> 29:48.180
All of a sudden,she's
just acting different.

29:48.180 --> 29:49.650
Different how?

29:50.110 --> 29:51.980
I don't know. You know,she
used to talk to me.

29:51.980 --> 29:56.170
We used to share
things; now she's lying.

29:56.960 --> 30:01.510
Oh,come on,I used to lie to my
parents all the time as a teenager.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.200
- Didn't you?
- Never.

30:04.720 --> 30:06.320
Okay,a lot.

30:06.320 --> 30:08.520
Oh,well,Mads is a really good kid.

30:08.520 --> 30:12.540
And I'm sure she's just
at the mall or the movies.

30:12.540 --> 30:14.700
Or lying in a ditch somewhere.

30:14.700 --> 30:16.520
You can't let yourself go there.

30:16.520 --> 30:18.660
I know. I'm sorry,it's just,uh...

30:19.330 --> 30:22.410
It's tough not to,in my
line of work,you know,so...

30:26.290 --> 30:27.920
What?

30:27.920 --> 30:31.640
I guess I just realized how
difficult this must be for you,

30:31.640 --> 30:33.860
to raise two kids on your own.

30:35.140 --> 30:39.070
For what it's worth,I think
you're a terrific father.

30:41.680 --> 30:43.300
Thank you.

30:43.300 --> 30:48.760
You know,I always wondered
about that decision I made.

30:48.760 --> 30:51.800
What it would've been like
to have kids of my own.

30:55.450 --> 30:59.540
I know I said this
before,but I'll say it again.

30:59.770 --> 31:02.440
I never blamed you for that.

31:06.150 --> 31:06.660
♪ Set the lights just how you want to ♪

31:06.660 --> 31:14.040
♪ Write the lines but
know they'll find you ♪

31:14.040 --> 31:16.130
- Yeah,I like it.
- Yeah?

31:16.130 --> 31:20.270
Um,what if it's more
like? Two,three,four.

31:20.270 --> 31:23.860
♪ Set the lights just how you want to ♪

31:23.860 --> 31:28.370
♪ Write the lines but
know they'll find you ♪

31:28.780 --> 31:31.860
Yeah. That's awesome; that's
way better. That's way better.

31:32.570 --> 31:35.990
All right,so remind me to tell Rebecca
thank you for giving me your number.

31:36.400 --> 31:38.160
Cool. You want to try it?

31:38.770 --> 31:42.390
♪ Set the lights Just how you want to ♪

31:42.390 --> 31:46.900
♪ Write the lines but
know they'll find you ♪

31:46.900 --> 31:49.060
You guys sound amazing.

31:50.050 --> 31:52.080
Baz,this is my sister,Sutton.

31:52.190 --> 31:53.400
Nice to meet you.

31:53.400 --> 31:55.070
I'm gonna grab my laptop.
Do you want to lay this down?

31:55.070 --> 31:57.010
- Yeah.
- Cool.

31:59.140 --> 32:01.360
He was the one you played
at the benefit with,right?

32:01.360 --> 32:05.300
Yes,and he just asked
me to be in his band.

32:05.520 --> 32:06.670
- Amazing,right?
- Yes.

32:06.670 --> 32:08.590
Now I have a perfect excuse.

32:08.590 --> 32:12.900
We rehearse twice a week,and then I'll tell
Mom and Dad that it's four, and go see Justin.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.140
Are you sure that's a good idea?

32:17.140 --> 32:19.610
You're the one who said I should lie.

32:19.760 --> 32:22.750
Right. Of course I did.

32:22.750 --> 32:25.310
Since when do you have
a problem with lying?

32:25.310 --> 32:29.440
I don't. It's just...

32:30.540 --> 32:34.570
With a lie like this,you'll be deceiving
people you care about every day.

32:34.570 --> 32:37.140
And I just,I don't want that for you.

32:37.140 --> 32:40.000
Big sis,worried about me.

32:40.500 --> 32:44.880
You're a total pain in the
ass sometimes,but I love you.

32:49.470 --> 32:51.500
Hey,what's the score?

32:51.870 --> 32:55.650
28-zip. Mental mistakes and turnovers.

32:59.840 --> 33:01.830
How's the studying going?

33:01.830 --> 33:05.100
Okay. Well,except for chemistry.

33:05.100 --> 33:07.300
lons and neutrons
- who can keep 'em straight?

33:07.830 --> 33:10.740
A few nerdy guys in
the lab. No one else.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.850
That cut should be just about
healed. Here,let's have a look.

33:16.850 --> 33:19.130
- Ah,no,it's fine. You're watching the game.
- No. It's a blowout.

33:19.130 --> 33:21.020
Come on. Come on,it'll
only take a minute.

33:21.020 --> 33:23.490
I said,it's fine.

33:32.930 --> 33:35.750
- And she's back.
- What was that about?

33:35.970 --> 33:40.540
Well,I went to check angel Sutton's
cut,and devil Sutton threw a fit.

33:40.540 --> 33:41.060
Ted...

33:41.060 --> 33:45.040
Honey,whatever happened between
you and her yesterday was a fluke.

33:47.470 --> 33:49.770
That's our real daughter.

33:57.230 --> 33:59.100
Do you want to tell
me where you've been?

33:59.170 --> 34:01.370
I was at the library with Sutton.

34:01.970 --> 34:06.410
That's interesting,because Sutton called
here three hours ago,looking for you.

34:08.260 --> 34:11.620
Want to try again,tell
me the truth? Maddie?

34:11.620 --> 34:16.840
One of my favorite bands was in town
for the night,and Ryan got tickets.

34:16.840 --> 34:19.120
- Slow Train.
- At Hangar 19?

34:19.510 --> 34:23.679
Oh,lucky. Those tickets have
been sold out for,like,a month...

34:24.429 --> 34:26.730
So,I'm gonna shut up now.

34:26.730 --> 34:29.639
Why don't you go up to your
room; we'll talk about it later?

34:34.820 --> 34:36.830
Yeah,you know,it's getting
late. We should probably...

34:36.940 --> 34:38.239
- I'm so sorry.
- That's all right.

34:38.239 --> 34:43.170
I shouldn't have said anything. It's...
It's just that Mads is a sweet kid.

34:43.429 --> 34:45.630
She's your daughter,and I
just want her to like me.

34:45.630 --> 34:49.790
- It's crazy,isn't it?
- Not at all.

34:51.650 --> 34:54.250
Well,at least let me help you clean up.

34:56.580 --> 34:59.900
So,Derek didn't try to kill Sutton?

34:59.900 --> 35:02.620
He said he was just supposed
to take her to meet someone.

35:02.620 --> 35:04.500
- Who?
- I never got it out of him.

35:04.500 --> 35:07.890
A few more minutes,he would've
talked, but this car pulled up outside,

35:07.890 --> 35:10.140
and me and Sutton made a run for it.

35:10.570 --> 35:12.180
Sorry.

35:12.180 --> 35:13.810
Are you sure you don't want
to get that checked out?

35:13.810 --> 35:18.920
It'll be fine. It's not broken,so...

35:18.920 --> 35:22.460
Sutton wants to go back there
tomorrow,though,see if he shows up.

35:23.880 --> 35:27.800
Well,she can't go by
herself. It's too dangerous.

35:28.500 --> 35:30.510
You should go with her.

35:35.400 --> 35:39.980
You know,every second I'm with
her,I'm thinking about you.

35:49.280 --> 35:50.600
I heard the call. What have you got?

35:50.600 --> 35:53.220
It looks like a drug deal
gone bad,from what we can tell.

35:53.570 --> 35:55.340
Dealer was beaten to death last night.

35:55.340 --> 35:58.200
Tire iron,or some other blunt object.

35:58.200 --> 36:00.780
We couldn't find it,but
we're still looking.

36:15.670 --> 36:18.520
Yeah,I know him. I was just
talking to my brother about him.

36:18.720 --> 36:21.190
Ethan have anything
against this Derek kid?

36:21.570 --> 36:22.440
Not that I know of. Why?

36:22.440 --> 36:25.240
I pulled him over last night
about a quarter mile from here.

36:25.240 --> 36:28.720
His hand was pretty busted
up,like he'd been in a fight.

36:29.440 --> 36:30.240
You don't know that.

36:30.240 --> 36:32.910
Look,it's not in the
record,I didn't write him up,

36:32.910 --> 36:36.550
but as soon as I mention this, they're
gonna want to bring him in for questioning.

36:36.550 --> 36:38.660
The Mercer girl,too.

36:38.660 --> 36:40.210
Sutton?

36:40.210 --> 36:41.760
- She was in the car with him.
- Damn it.

36:41.760 --> 36:43.940
Give me an hour. Just give me one hour.

36:43.940 --> 36:45.390
All right.

36:48.410 --> 36:50.700
Hey,how come you didn't
show up at the library?

36:50.700 --> 36:52.860
You are unbelievable.

36:53.280 --> 36:56.440
Don't go giving me that innocent look.
You've been planning this all along.

36:57.020 --> 36:59.770
I honestly have no idea
what you're talking about.

36:59.930 --> 37:03.010
If you didn't want me going out with
Ryan, you should have just said so.

37:03.010 --> 37:05.260
Now I'm grounded for a week.

37:05.260 --> 37:07.140
So thanks a lot.

37:14.640 --> 37:17.360
Did you get in a fight with
Derek Rogers last night?

37:17.590 --> 37:20.250
Yeah. Why,is that against the law?

37:21.000 --> 37:23.430
When the other guy dies,it
is. It's called murder.

37:23.930 --> 37:27.130
They found his body outside
of a body shop,beaten to death.

37:27.410 --> 37:31.300
I hit the guy once. He
came at me with a tire iron.

37:31.300 --> 37:33.200
So you're telling me you were there?

37:33.200 --> 37:36.620
He... He was working on
a car inside the shop.

37:37.320 --> 37:40.840
Dan,I clocked him pretty hard,but he
was getting up by the time I was leaving.

37:40.840 --> 37:42.500
Where have you been since then?

37:42.500 --> 37:45.160
I was with Sutton at the
Mercers',and then I'm here.

37:45.160 --> 37:47.480
Anyone else besides your
girlfriend see you there?

37:47.480 --> 37:49.990
- No.
- So she's your only alibi?

37:52.080 --> 37:53.380
Yes.

37:53.720 --> 37:57.740
Damn it,Ethan. Damn
you for this! Come on!

37:57.740 --> 38:01.370
Dan,I swear to you,I did
not kill this guy,okay?

38:09.070 --> 38:10.830
You need to get out of town right now.

38:10.830 --> 38:12.720
If I run,they're going to
think I did it for sure.

38:12.720 --> 38:15.290
You don't have a choice!

38:15.700 --> 38:19.670
With your record,they will fry
your ass for this,you understand me?

38:21.810 --> 38:23.660
All right,hmm?

38:24.550 --> 38:26.860
Take this. It's not
much. It's all I got.

38:27.900 --> 38:32.090
And I promise you,I will find
whoever really killed this kid,okay?

38:32.090 --> 38:35.730
But until then,you need to lay low.

38:35.730 --> 38:41.040
No phone calls,no texts,no
video messages,whatever.

38:41.310 --> 38:42.870
Not even to Sutton.

38:43.900 --> 38:48.120
- All right?
- All right. All right.

38:54.400 --> 38:56.530
If you don't find out who did this,

38:57.290 --> 39:00.020
there's no coming back here,is there?

39:01.300 --> 39:04.100
No.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.720
Go on,get out of here. Go on!

39:28.470 --> 39:31.260
If you're calling about Derek
Rogers,I've already heard.

39:31.460 --> 39:33.140
I'm headed over to the station now.

39:33.140 --> 39:36.790
Dan,I understand your brother
may be mixed up in this.

39:37.310 --> 39:39.730
You have any idea where he is?

39:40.530 --> 39:42.730
No. I haven't seen him since last night.

39:42.730 --> 39:45.210
Call me when you know more.

39:46.010 --> 39:47.720
Everything okay?

39:48.730 --> 39:51.660
Derek Rogers was found
dead this morning.

39:52.220 --> 39:53.230
What?!

39:53.230 --> 39:57.350
They think Ethan Whitehorse
may be mixed up in it.

39:57.620 --> 40:00.320
No. No,there's no way.

40:01.920 --> 40:05.080
It's important you keep your distance
from him right now,do you understand?

40:05.080 --> 40:07.490
That boy's in serious trouble.

40:09.340 --> 40:12.830
I was there. I can tell
the cops what happened.

40:12.830 --> 40:15.120
Derek was alive when we left.

40:15.120 --> 40:17.110
They'll think you're
lying to protect me.

40:17.110 --> 40:18.550
Ethan,you can't just run away.

40:18.550 --> 40:21.560
If I stay here,I'm
going down for this,okay?

40:21.560 --> 40:23.500
Now,get your stuff together.
We got to get to Emma.

40:23.720 --> 40:24.940
You talked to her?

40:24.940 --> 40:26.770
Midterms. Her phone's off.

40:26.770 --> 40:28.380
So that's the plan?

40:28.380 --> 40:31.560
We switch places again,and
you guys run away together?

40:31.560 --> 40:34.010
You both can't be here right
now. It's way too dangerous.

40:34.010 --> 40:36.340
- We'll be fine.
- Don't you get it?

40:36.340 --> 40:40.010
Someone killed Derek because we
were getting too close to the truth.

40:40.010 --> 40:42.710
So,what am I supposed
to do,just be here alone?

40:42.710 --> 40:46.630
Look,the cops are gonna be watching
you 24/7,waiting for me to show up.

40:46.630 --> 40:48.190
You'll be safer here.

40:49.950 --> 40:51.880
What the hell happened last night?

40:51.880 --> 40:54.510
My dad is saying that
you killed Derek Rogers.

40:56.070 --> 40:59.300
No time for this right now. I'll
tell you on the way. Let's go.

41:07.180 --> 41:08.390
All right,I'll head in and find Emma.

41:08.390 --> 41:11.680
- What if they see the two of you?
- I'm going in.

41:12.060 --> 41:15.200
You and Emma can swap clothes behind
that Dumpster when we get back.

41:16.260 --> 41:19.880
Well,guess I'm failing
my midterms after all.

41:28.540 --> 41:29.090
Come on.

41:29.090 --> 41:30.940
Ethan,where have you been?
You missed the last exam.

41:30.940 --> 41:33.000
- You need to come with me.
- No,I have a test.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.490
Derek's dead.

41:34.490 --> 41:37.990
Okay,the cops found his body
this morning. They think I did it.

41:37.990 --> 41:40.010
- Oh,my God.
- Come on,let's go.

41:51.700 --> 41:53.020
Are you all right?

41:53.020 --> 41:56.880
Uh,yeah,I just... I broke my heel.

41:56.880 --> 42:00.740
I need to talk to you.
Let me help you with that.

42:08.220 --> 42:10.460
There you go.

42:11.030 --> 42:14.270
- Have you seen Ethan
Whitehorse today? - Uh-uh,no.

42:14.420 --> 42:16.710
I actually have to go
take an exam,though,so...

42:16.710 --> 42:19.710
Actually,I think you
need to come with me.

42:22.830 --> 42:26.020
- Where's Emma?
- The cops got to her. We can't make the switch.

42:26.710 --> 42:28.650
Get out... both of you.

42:28.650 --> 42:29.940
I... I'm coming with you.

42:29.940 --> 42:32.320
No,you're not. Get out!

42:32.320 --> 42:33.730
No,I'm coming with you!

42:33.730 --> 42:36.260
It's too dangerous for both of
us to be here at the same time.

42:36.260 --> 42:38.690
You said it yourself.

42:39.700 --> 42:41.010
Just go!

43:00.220 --> 43:02.320
I'd like to see this one.

43:02.760 --> 43:04.900
Excellent choice.

43:07.870 --> 43:09.470
Stunning.

43:09.470 --> 43:12.120
Has he popped the question?

43:12.120 --> 43:15.610
Not yet,but it's only a matter of time.
