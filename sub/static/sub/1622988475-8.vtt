Previously onWhy Women Kill...

00:06.963 --> 00:08.617
Oh, you're gonna
try to pin this on me?

00:08.660 --> 00:11.750
-All I know is I didn't do it.
-Well, neither did I.

00:11.794 --> 00:14.014
-Do you know the lady
who lives here?
-Mrs. Yost!

00:14.057 --> 00:15.189
When was the last time
you saw her?

00:15.232 --> 00:17.060
ALMA:
Two days ago.

00:17.104 --> 00:19.193
She was taking a trip up north
to visit her sister.

00:19.236 --> 00:21.934
CATHERINE:
And I'm sure Rita's been
cheating on him this whole time.

00:21.978 --> 00:23.066
Any idea who with?

00:23.110 --> 00:24.502
But once I find out,

00:24.546 --> 00:26.765
I'll make Rita
and her gigolo very sorry.

00:26.809 --> 00:28.071
[weak chuckle]

00:28.115 --> 00:30.291
I did not kill Carlo.

00:30.334 --> 00:31.683
I'm gonna take your case.

00:31.727 --> 00:32.858
But we have to
think about our future

00:32.902 --> 00:34.904
-and the baby.
-Baby?!

00:34.947 --> 00:36.949
-Oh, boy.
-I plan to nominate you again.

00:36.993 --> 00:40.040
If you still want to be a part
of our silly club.

00:40.083 --> 00:41.476
I do.

00:41.519 --> 00:43.391
I'm gonna be all by myself
in this cold,

00:43.434 --> 00:46.002
-empty house.
-I sure wouldn't want you
to be lonely.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.831
BERTRAM:
Why a man is dead and his wife
is in jail for murder--

00:48.874 --> 00:50.441
all so you could
get into a garden club.

00:50.485 --> 00:52.182
We're about to be grandparents.

00:52.226 --> 00:54.576
Let's just put all this
unpleasantness behind us.

00:54.619 --> 00:58.580
ISABEL:
I just decided to stay in town
a couple more days. Promising

00:58.623 --> 01:01.931
business opportunity
has just presented itself.

01:07.763 --> 01:11.288
NARRATOR:
Rita Castillo had always
thought of herself as a woman

01:11.332 --> 01:14.596
who would do anything
to survive.

01:14.639 --> 01:18.034
And she had the rap sheet
to prove it.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.471
She'd stolen money.

01:20.515 --> 01:22.995
She'd sold her body.

01:23.039 --> 01:25.998
She even helped to kill a man.

01:26.042 --> 01:27.696
But she was now in jail

01:27.739 --> 01:30.568
for a crime she didn't commit.

01:30.612 --> 01:34.137
And no one believed
a woman like her

01:34.181 --> 01:36.096
could be innocent.

01:37.575 --> 01:40.012
They're calling me
a black widow?

01:40.056 --> 01:41.840
That's one
of the nicer headlines.

01:41.884 --> 01:44.539
Is this your way of telling me
you won't take my case?

01:44.582 --> 01:46.149
With publicity like this?

01:46.193 --> 01:48.891
You bet I'll take it.
And I'll win it, too.

01:48.934 --> 01:51.633
Good, because I did not
kill my husband.

01:51.676 --> 01:53.069
And that's the truth.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.158
Murder trials
aren't about the truth.

01:55.202 --> 01:59.031
They're about stories.
And the D.A.'S got a juicy one.

01:59.075 --> 02:00.903
Rich guy ends up dead.

02:00.946 --> 02:03.645
His cheating wife is caught
with poison in her purse.

02:03.688 --> 02:05.690
Mm.
You got a better one?

02:05.734 --> 02:06.822
I was framed.

02:06.865 --> 02:08.215
Is that the best you can do?

02:08.258 --> 02:09.477
It's what happened.

02:09.520 --> 02:11.261
Someone put that syringe
in my bag.

02:11.305 --> 02:14.003
But who? And don't say his
daughter-- she's got an alibi.

02:14.046 --> 02:16.136
Who else was home that night?

02:16.179 --> 02:18.181
Just my cousin, Isabel.

02:18.225 --> 02:20.749
Who also happens
to work as my maid.

02:21.750 --> 02:22.925
Hello.

02:22.968 --> 02:24.927
There's our killer.

02:24.970 --> 02:27.147
-What?
-Yeah, this is good.
This is good.

02:27.190 --> 02:29.932
She, uh, she framed you
because she hates your guts.

02:29.975 --> 02:32.326
What? Please.
Isabel loves me.

02:32.369 --> 02:33.631
No, no, no, no, she used to,

02:33.675 --> 02:35.067
but, uh, she's gotten jealous

02:35.111 --> 02:36.634
of your looks, your money...

02:36.678 --> 02:39.071
You had everything.
She had bupkis.

02:39.115 --> 02:40.638
She wanted you to suffer.

02:41.596 --> 02:43.424
And you really think
a jury would buy that?

02:43.467 --> 02:45.121
Well, it's worth a shot.

02:45.165 --> 02:48.211
Here. I need you to answer
these questions for me.

02:48.255 --> 02:50.779
If we're gonna pin this
on Isabel, I'm gonna need

02:50.822 --> 02:53.477
every bit of dirt on her
that you can shovel.

02:53.521 --> 02:56.219
This is just a strategy
to get me out of jail, right?

02:56.263 --> 02:57.220
Of course.

02:57.264 --> 02:58.700
But if people believe this,

02:58.743 --> 03:00.484
isn't there a chance
Isabel could be arrested

03:00.528 --> 03:01.703
for Carlo's murder?

03:03.400 --> 03:05.533
That's a good question.

03:05.576 --> 03:07.578
I got a better one.

03:07.622 --> 03:10.494
Do you want to spend
the rest of your life in prison?

03:12.148 --> 03:15.238
NARRATOR:
Yes, Rita Castillo had
always thought of herself

03:15.282 --> 03:19.024
as a woman who would
do anything to survive.

03:21.679 --> 03:23.725
She was now about to find out...

03:25.553 --> 03:28.817
...if that was true.

03:30.819 --> 03:32.864
♪

03:51.927 --> 03:54.756
NARRATOR: Alma Fillcot
walked into her garden that day

03:54.799 --> 03:57.411
hoping to prune her roses.

03:57.454 --> 03:59.326
But before she began,

03:59.369 --> 04:02.677
Alma decided to have a chat

04:02.720 --> 04:05.114
with an old friend.

04:05.157 --> 04:07.203
Mrs. Yost.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.727
How are you this fine morning?

04:09.771 --> 04:11.163
Still dead?

04:11.207 --> 04:12.817
Pity.

04:12.861 --> 04:15.559
If you were here,
you'd see how good I'm looking.

04:15.603 --> 04:17.953
It's not because
of any mascara or rouge.

04:17.996 --> 04:19.041
No, ma'am.

04:19.084 --> 04:21.173
I have learned firsthand

04:21.217 --> 04:24.089
that crushing one's enemies
is the best cosmetic.

04:25.352 --> 04:27.092
What do you say to that?

04:28.006 --> 04:29.660
Alma?

04:31.619 --> 04:33.490
Oh! [laughs] Grace.

04:33.534 --> 04:34.839
-You scared me. [chuckles]
-Oh.

04:34.883 --> 04:36.319
Sorry.

04:36.363 --> 04:38.495
I was going to call,
but I thought,

04:38.539 --> 04:40.976
"No, I want to see her face
when I tell her."

04:41.977 --> 04:42.978
Tell me what?

04:43.021 --> 04:44.632
I spoke to the girls last night.

04:44.675 --> 04:46.198
We all agreed.

04:46.242 --> 04:48.592
Rita is out of the Garden Club
and you're in.

04:48.636 --> 04:50.420
Ah! Oh.

04:50.464 --> 04:52.117
-I'm so happy.
-Oh, me too.

04:52.161 --> 04:54.032
Will there be a luncheon
like before?

04:54.076 --> 04:55.860
-This Friday.
-Oh.

04:55.904 --> 04:57.732
Oh, but I won't be able to come.
I have a wedding out of town.

04:57.775 --> 04:59.864
You have to be
at my first meeting.

04:59.908 --> 05:01.431
I'm only in because of you.

05:01.475 --> 05:02.476
I wish I could.

05:02.519 --> 05:03.999
Are you free tonight?

05:04.042 --> 05:06.175
The ladies could come here,
just for an hour.

05:06.218 --> 05:10.092
-Well, I suppose a little
celebration is in order.
-[giggles]

05:10.135 --> 05:12.181
Excellent.
Uh, shall we say 6:00?

05:12.224 --> 05:13.661
I will rally the troops.

05:13.704 --> 05:15.358
-[laughs]
-Oh!

05:15.402 --> 05:16.925
Bye.

05:21.016 --> 05:23.453
Did you hear that, Mrs. Yost?

05:23.497 --> 05:25.412
I'm in the Garden Club.

05:25.455 --> 05:28.589
The club you said
would never have me as a member.

05:29.764 --> 05:31.853
Have fun turning in your grave.

05:36.074 --> 05:37.467
Good morning, baby.

05:37.511 --> 05:39.991
Oh, Scooter.
How handsome you look.

05:40.949 --> 05:43.778
And another smooch
for my snazzy new robe.

05:43.821 --> 05:47.216
Well, I gladly take the kiss,
but the robe is not from me.

05:47.259 --> 05:50.045
Come on. It just magically
appeared at the foot of my bed?

05:51.829 --> 05:53.701
Is the robe to your liking, sir?

05:53.744 --> 05:55.224
Yeah.

05:55.267 --> 05:57.182
But if it's from you
I'm paying in handshakes.

05:57.226 --> 05:59.707
This is Otto,
my butler from Texas.

05:59.750 --> 06:01.056
He's agreed to work for me here.

06:01.099 --> 06:02.884
Oh, a real butler, huh?

06:02.927 --> 06:06.104
With a name like Otto, maybe you
should have been a chauffeur.

06:06.148 --> 06:08.237
I bet you hear that one a lot.

06:08.280 --> 06:10.544
Thankfully, no.

06:12.589 --> 06:13.764
Don't tease Otto.

06:13.808 --> 06:16.419
He's German.
It'll end badly.

06:16.463 --> 06:18.029
So, what do you want
to do today--

06:18.073 --> 06:20.554
uh, have a swim,
catch a movie?

06:20.597 --> 06:22.947
I can't. I'm busy
going through Rita's records.

06:22.991 --> 06:26.124
I need to prove
she had a lover here in LA.

06:27.648 --> 06:29.563
Who cares
if she had a boyfriend?

06:29.606 --> 06:31.216
The district attorney.

06:31.260 --> 06:33.654
He says evidence of an affair

06:33.697 --> 06:36.526
will help convict her
of Papa's murder.

06:36.570 --> 06:38.659
Haven't you been through
enough all ready

06:38.702 --> 06:40.704
without doing
the D.A.'s job for him?

06:40.748 --> 06:42.184
You need to relax.

06:42.227 --> 06:43.925
I-I say skip the trial.

06:43.968 --> 06:45.317
Get out of town.

06:45.361 --> 06:47.494
We'll go to Rome
or somewhere in Europe.

06:47.537 --> 06:49.496
Mm.
Nothing would please me more

06:49.539 --> 06:51.236
than to take a little trip
with you.

06:51.280 --> 06:54.457
But don't worry,
this won't take long.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.462
You'll be packing your bags
before you know it.

ALMA:
Bertram.

07:08.471 --> 07:10.299
There you are.

07:10.342 --> 07:11.735
I have wonderful news.

07:11.779 --> 07:13.215
It's official.

07:13.258 --> 07:15.435
I've been accepted
into the Garden Club.

07:16.523 --> 07:17.567
Mm.

07:21.179 --> 07:23.138
The ladies are coming over
this evening

07:23.181 --> 07:24.661
to help me celebrate.

07:24.705 --> 07:27.142
I'm going up to the attic
to get my punch bowl.

07:27.185 --> 07:29.884
If you don't mind, I could use
your help with the cups.

07:32.277 --> 07:33.365
Bertram.

07:33.409 --> 07:36.020
I've been thinking about Rita,

07:36.064 --> 07:38.545
and her little cat.
[chuckles]: Aw.

07:38.588 --> 07:40.068
She loves him so much.

07:40.111 --> 07:41.504
Of course she loves him.

07:41.548 --> 07:43.245
They're the same species.

07:43.288 --> 07:45.769
She may be tried
for a crime we committed.

07:45.813 --> 07:47.205
Don't you care at all?

07:47.249 --> 07:49.251
Let's say that I do.

07:49.294 --> 07:50.774
Do you want me to confess?

07:50.818 --> 07:53.168
Would you be happier
if we both went to jail?

07:53.211 --> 07:54.604
At least we'd deserve it.

07:54.648 --> 07:56.563
Oh, what a thing to say.

07:56.606 --> 07:58.695
Actions have consequences.

07:58.739 --> 08:01.176
Well, you weren't keen to face
any when you were filling up

08:01.219 --> 08:03.744
graveyards
with your previous victims.

08:03.787 --> 08:06.703
My fondest dream
is finally coming true.

If you can't share in my joy,

Sure.

Disappearance?

No, she's just away on a trip.

her dog while she's gone.

I said I got proof
Rita didn't kill Carlo.

-What is it?
-Not so fast.

09:29.264 --> 09:32.223
You tell Rita
it's gonna cost her 20 Gs.

09:32.267 --> 09:33.616
I need to be compensated

09:33.660 --> 09:35.662
for the way she treated me
all these years.

with my own eyes.

You already had your chance.

09:40.405 --> 09:41.972
My advice?

Pay more attention
next time you aim your Kodak.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.330
Tell me what you have.

09:52.374 --> 09:53.941
Not yet.

09:53.984 --> 09:56.291
I've waited a long time
for my ship to come in,

09:56.334 --> 09:58.554
and I'm not gonna
miss it this time.

10:04.865 --> 10:06.823
-Mom.
-Hmm?

10:06.867 --> 10:08.956
When Mrs. Yost asked you
to look after Rocco,

10:08.999 --> 10:10.479
where did she say she was going?

10:12.133 --> 10:15.832
Uh, she said she was paying
a surprise visit to her sister.

10:15.876 --> 10:17.355
Why?

10:17.399 --> 10:18.966
Apparently, she never got there.

10:19.009 --> 10:20.707
The police say she's missing.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.578
Oh, yes.

10:22.622 --> 10:25.407
You know, uh, they
did mention that. [chuckles]

10:25.450 --> 10:26.974
You spoke to the police?

10:27.017 --> 10:28.410
When?

10:28.453 --> 10:31.108
Uh, a detective stopped by,
weeks ago,

10:31.152 --> 10:33.197
asking all sorts of questions.

10:33.241 --> 10:34.677
Why didn't you tell me?

10:34.721 --> 10:37.332
Well, I was busy
getting ready to host a party.

10:37.375 --> 10:39.247
It just slipped my mind.

10:39.290 --> 10:42.250
Well, the cops are starting
to think Mrs. Yost was murdered.

10:45.122 --> 10:46.471
Why?

10:46.515 --> 10:47.821
Did they find her body?

10:47.864 --> 10:49.126
No.

10:49.170 --> 10:50.650
But they found her car
in a lake.

10:50.693 --> 10:52.129
Oh.

10:52.173 --> 10:53.653
Well...

10:53.696 --> 10:55.785
Sounds to me like
they are jumping to conclusions.

10:55.829 --> 10:58.179
Now, how does this look?

10:58.222 --> 11:00.355
How can you be so calm?

11:00.398 --> 11:02.618
Well, we don't know
what's happened.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.795
Besides,
I'm in too good a mood to fret.

11:05.839 --> 11:08.493
I've finally been accepted
into the Garden Club.

11:08.537 --> 11:10.931
Some of the ladies
are coming by this evening

11:10.974 --> 11:12.149
to help me celebrate.

11:12.193 --> 11:13.281
Oh.

11:13.324 --> 11:14.761
-Congratulations.
-Hmm.

11:14.804 --> 11:17.502
Well, it's not just a victory
for me, Deirdre.

11:17.546 --> 11:20.114
Once I'm settled
and I have some sway

11:20.157 --> 11:22.812
with the membership committee,
I'll get you in as well.

11:23.813 --> 11:25.641
-Mom, I'm-I'm getting married.
-Hmm.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.121
I have a baby on the way.

11:27.164 --> 11:29.166
I'm not gonna have time
for a silly club.

11:29.210 --> 11:30.690
Remember...

11:30.733 --> 11:32.082
Babies grow up

11:32.126 --> 11:34.345
and men work late.

11:34.389 --> 11:37.305
Before you know it,
your life will seem very drab.

11:38.785 --> 11:40.743
And you'll yearn
for glamorous friends

11:40.787 --> 11:42.876
to give your days
a bit of color.

11:43.920 --> 11:46.531
Just don't wait too long
to find them.

11:46.575 --> 11:48.403
The years fly by.

11:48.446 --> 11:51.885
And the next thing you know,
you'll be cold in your grave.

11:52.929 --> 11:55.236
Like poor Mrs. Yost.

11:57.194 --> 11:59.370
Assuming she's dead.

12:00.589 --> 12:02.330
Which I'm sure she's not.

12:06.769 --> 12:09.641
ALMA:
All right, and for Grace.

12:09.685 --> 12:12.122
-Mm. Delicious.
-[laughing]

12:12.166 --> 12:13.558
Oh, yum. Yum. Yum

12:13.602 --> 12:14.777
-All right...
-Wonderful.

12:14.821 --> 12:16.474
Ladies, a toast.

12:16.518 --> 12:18.694
To our club's newest member...

12:18.738 --> 12:21.001
-Oh.
-Alma Fillcot.

12:21.044 --> 12:22.654
-Cheers!
-To Alma.

12:22.698 --> 12:24.831
Thank you all so much.

12:24.874 --> 12:26.136
Oh, don't thank us.

12:26.180 --> 12:28.443
Thank Rita
and her handy hypodermic.

12:28.486 --> 12:31.446
Now, now. Rita is innocent
till proven guilty.

12:31.489 --> 12:33.317
Is she sweet
until proven bitchy?

12:33.361 --> 12:36.016
-'Cause I want to serve
on that jury.
-ALMA: Oh, Joan.

12:37.974 --> 12:41.021
Alma, perhaps you'd like
to say a few words?

12:41.064 --> 12:43.327
Oh, no. I-I couldn't possibly.
I...

12:43.371 --> 12:45.112
-Oh, you must.
-Oh, please.

12:45.155 --> 12:48.376
-Yeah. You must.
-I suppose if tradition
demands it. I...

12:48.419 --> 12:49.551
-Yes.
-Speech, speech.
-Oh, wonderful.

12:49.594 --> 12:50.770
-Speech. Speech.
-Yes. Speech.

12:50.813 --> 12:52.641
[clears throat]

13:00.954 --> 13:04.087
These are trying times
for us all.

13:05.088 --> 13:08.875
Our Garden Club's
rosy reputation has been pierced

13:08.918 --> 13:11.486
by thorns of scandal.

13:12.922 --> 13:14.358
But when I look out

13:14.402 --> 13:16.534
at all your smiling faces, my...

13:16.578 --> 13:18.710
-[doorbell rings]
-Oh, for goodness' sake.

13:19.668 --> 13:20.887
Ladies.

13:20.930 --> 13:23.150
Please excuse me.
[chuckles]

13:24.368 --> 13:25.587
Mrs. Fillcot?

13:25.630 --> 13:26.849
I'm Isabel.

13:26.893 --> 13:28.677
I used to work
for Rita Castillo.

13:28.720 --> 13:31.245
It's urgent that I speak to you.
May I come in?

13:31.288 --> 13:34.074
If you're looking for a new job,
you've come at a bad time.

13:34.117 --> 13:35.815
I'm hosting
the Garden Club ladies.

13:35.858 --> 13:38.861
-Then it's a good time.
-Oh, uh, um...

13:38.905 --> 13:41.733
I-I... I can't let you
bother my guests.

13:41.777 --> 13:44.040
I'm not here about a job.

13:44.084 --> 13:45.868
What's this?

13:45.912 --> 13:48.566
This was taken at Rita's house
the night Carlo was killed.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.395
That's Catherine.

13:51.439 --> 13:53.658
That's Scooter.

13:53.702 --> 13:54.790
And that's...

13:54.834 --> 13:56.357
you.

13:58.359 --> 14:00.665
Now can I come in?

14:08.804 --> 14:10.240
-[laughter]
-Joan.

14:10.284 --> 14:11.894
I'll be with you in a moment,
ladies.

14:11.938 --> 14:14.897
I just have to attend
to a domestic issue.

14:14.941 --> 14:16.333
Yes...

14:16.377 --> 14:18.074
Where did you get that?

14:18.118 --> 14:20.729
Rita got a guy to get a photo
of Catherine having sex

14:20.772 --> 14:22.557
so she could blackmail her.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.472
Now I'll use it
to blackmail you.

14:24.515 --> 14:25.777
Isn't life funny?

14:25.821 --> 14:27.997
I don't know why you're so smug.

14:28.041 --> 14:29.433
That photo proves nothing.

14:29.477 --> 14:31.131
It proves you were there.

14:31.174 --> 14:32.872
You killed Carlo

14:32.915 --> 14:34.874
and put the needle
in Rita's purse.

14:34.917 --> 14:37.833
And now you'll have to pay me
to keep quiet.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.922
Everything you just said
is a lie.

14:40.836 --> 14:42.620
But how much money
are we talking?

14:42.664 --> 14:43.926
$20,000.

14:43.970 --> 14:46.886
-20,000?!
-In cash.

14:46.929 --> 14:48.931
Bring it to this hotel
tomorrow night

14:48.975 --> 14:50.802
or I'll go to the cops.

14:50.846 --> 14:53.675
This was supposed
to be my lovely night.

14:53.718 --> 14:55.242
And you've spoiled it.

14:55.285 --> 14:57.244
Yeah, I'm awful.

14:57.287 --> 14:58.941
Picking on a nice lady

14:58.985 --> 15:01.335
just 'cause she killed a man
and framed my boss.

15:01.378 --> 15:03.598
Uh, please go out the back way.

15:04.599 --> 15:06.035
Lady...

15:06.079 --> 15:08.385
Talk to me
like I'm the help one more time

15:08.429 --> 15:11.127
and I'll destroy you
just for the hell of it.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.653
Oh.

15:20.745 --> 15:21.964
Scooter.

15:22.008 --> 15:23.792
Come upstairs.
I need you.

15:23.835 --> 15:25.359
What's going on?

15:25.402 --> 15:27.274
I'm searching the house.
I need to find something

15:27.317 --> 15:29.015
that will prove
that Rita had a lover.

15:29.058 --> 15:30.407
But you looked after breakfast.

15:30.451 --> 15:31.931
You said
you didn't find anything.

15:32.975 --> 15:34.846
I remembered something.

15:34.890 --> 15:37.153
Papa was convinced that Rita
had a hiding place

15:37.197 --> 15:39.373
where she kept things from him.

15:39.416 --> 15:42.767
I'm gonna find it, even if I
have to take this house apart.

15:42.811 --> 15:44.421
Let me just fix myself a drink,

15:44.465 --> 15:46.119
and I'll be right up
to help you.

15:46.162 --> 15:47.381
Don't take too long.

16:23.895 --> 16:26.681
Madame, could this be something?

16:26.724 --> 16:28.335
Oh, that's Rita's account book.

16:28.378 --> 16:29.684
I've already been through that.

16:29.727 --> 16:31.207
According to this,

16:31.251 --> 16:33.557
she was renting some apartment
in Chinatown.

16:33.601 --> 16:35.429
Yes, I've been there once.

16:35.472 --> 16:38.432
I tried to catch her red-handed
but the apartment was empty.

16:38.475 --> 16:40.782
She must have
moved her lover out.

16:40.825 --> 16:43.785
Would you go downstairs
and see what's keeping Scooter?

16:43.828 --> 16:45.569
Of course.

16:51.314 --> 16:53.099
Mr. Scooter.

16:53.142 --> 16:54.491
Miss Catherine is wondering

16:54.535 --> 16:56.363
when you might
join her upstairs.

16:56.406 --> 16:58.017
Going right now.

16:58.060 --> 16:59.670
I was just enjoying the fire.

17:17.123 --> 17:19.125
♪

17:35.315 --> 17:37.578
Oh. Izzy, we can't take
the silver candlesticks.

17:37.621 --> 17:39.058
They belonged to Harry's mother.

17:39.101 --> 17:41.277
This is what he gets
for slapping you around.

17:41.321 --> 17:43.366
We'll hock 'em
once we get to El Paso.

17:43.410 --> 17:44.846
Now, come on.

17:44.889 --> 17:46.152
Here, you take that.

17:46.195 --> 17:47.501
-I'll take the small one.
-RITA: Okay.

17:48.545 --> 17:49.894
What's this?

17:49.938 --> 17:51.070
[gasps]

17:51.113 --> 17:52.810
Harry.

17:52.854 --> 17:54.769
I thought you were at work.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.555
You going somewhere?

18:00.253 --> 18:02.211
Mama called.

18:02.255 --> 18:03.473
She's very sick.

18:03.517 --> 18:04.866
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

18:04.909 --> 18:05.867
It's serious.

18:05.910 --> 18:08.304
I left you a note.

18:10.611 --> 18:12.526
See...

18:12.569 --> 18:14.354
I think
you're trying to leave me.

18:14.397 --> 18:16.660
She's in a hospital.
I swear.

18:16.704 --> 18:18.619
I'm so sick of all your lies!

18:18.662 --> 18:19.663
-Ow!
-Let her go!

18:19.707 --> 18:21.839
-Shut up!
-Please!

18:21.883 --> 18:23.319
Please don't hurt her!

18:23.363 --> 18:25.016
I'll stay.

18:25.060 --> 18:26.714
If that's what you want.

18:26.757 --> 18:30.021
What did I say I'd do to you
if this happened again?

18:30.065 --> 18:31.414
Hmm?

18:31.458 --> 18:33.677
What did I say?!

18:33.721 --> 18:35.288
-[gunshot]
-[groans]

18:36.724 --> 18:38.726
You ugly bitch.

18:42.338 --> 18:43.687
Is he dead?

18:43.731 --> 18:45.863
He called me ugly.
Who cares?

18:45.907 --> 18:47.126
Come on.

19:02.750 --> 19:04.143
$20,000?

19:04.186 --> 19:05.405
That's what Isabel said.

19:05.448 --> 19:07.320
And she wants it
by tomorrow night.

19:07.363 --> 19:09.191
We'll obviously have to pay it.

19:09.235 --> 19:10.845
I'll go to the bank
in the morning

19:10.888 --> 19:12.020
and empty our savings account.

19:12.063 --> 19:13.761
We barely have 10,000.

19:13.804 --> 19:16.067
Then I'll have to get
a second mortgage or something.

19:16.111 --> 19:17.634
Do you think
she'd give us more time?

19:17.678 --> 19:20.289
I think she'd prefer
not to negotiate.

19:20.333 --> 19:22.683
[groans]
This is all your fault.

19:22.726 --> 19:25.773
I told you,
actions have consequences.

19:25.816 --> 19:27.949
And now here we are,
swimming in the foul swamp

19:27.992 --> 19:29.168
that you have dug for us.

19:29.211 --> 19:31.170
You know...

19:31.213 --> 19:34.173
We could handle the situation...

19:34.216 --> 19:35.435
permanently.

19:36.479 --> 19:37.959
No!

19:38.002 --> 19:39.395
Well, if actions
have consequences,

19:39.439 --> 19:41.441
shouldn't that apply
to Isabel too?

19:41.484 --> 19:43.007
For the love of God, just stop.

19:43.051 --> 19:44.313
If we pay her,

19:44.357 --> 19:46.446
she'll just come back
again and again,

19:46.489 --> 19:48.535
until the well runs dry.

19:48.578 --> 19:49.971
Do you love me?

19:50.014 --> 19:51.059
At all?

19:51.102 --> 19:53.061
What?
Of course I do.

19:53.104 --> 19:55.716
Then, for once, stop arguing and
do what your husband demands--

19:55.759 --> 19:57.718
no, no-- implores you to do.

19:57.761 --> 19:59.241
And if you can't...

19:59.285 --> 20:01.156
Well, perhaps,
this isn't a marriage at all.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.245
Where are you going?

20:03.289 --> 20:05.029
I'm going to sleep
in the guest room.

20:05.073 --> 20:07.423
I'll return to our bed when
you're a little less lethal.

20:14.430 --> 20:16.563
Hi.
Are you Mrs. Yost's nephew?

20:16.606 --> 20:18.782
Yeah, I'm Irving.
Who are you?

20:18.826 --> 20:20.871
Dee Fillcot.
I live next door.

20:20.915 --> 20:22.221
I wanted you to know

20:22.264 --> 20:23.918
my parents have been
looking after

20:23.961 --> 20:25.963
your aunt's dog
while she's away.

20:26.964 --> 20:28.444
The cops think she's dead.

20:28.488 --> 20:29.924
Oh.

20:29.967 --> 20:31.621
Did they find her body?

20:31.665 --> 20:33.797
Not yet, but
she was definitely robbed.
