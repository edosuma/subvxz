that's when Chris went to steam.

that I had been on the phone
with her for 50 minutes,

in the steam room.

who said Chris switched
to a big agency behind his back

06:02.830 --> 06:04.363
to make the deal
for "Gold Storm."

06:04.365 --> 06:05.964
Sean was suing
for his commission,

10% of Chris' huge salary.

too many temptations

drug of choice was oxycodone,

with Gary's parents, anyway?

No, it's not like

Wait, so you're just giving her
to the Lewises and walking away?

10:02.936 --> 10:05.837
I spoke to Jim and Linda
about it,

10:05.839 --> 10:10.308

that it's best

10:10.310 --> 10:12.611
if I either come and live
with them

10:25.192 --> 10:29.060
Look, doing what you wanted here
is important,

10:29.062 --> 10:32.297

that this little girl

this Very Vanilla protein powder

11:02.829 --> 11:06.231
that we brought back from the
search of Chris Walker's house.

11:06.233 --> 11:11.036
Bronze equals a match
for oxycodone.

11:11.038 --> 11:14.739
So the drugs were mixed
with vanilla protein powder.

11:14.741 --> 11:16.408
Very Vanilla,
which is why the dogs

11:16.410 --> 11:18.943
didn't find anything
when Hollywood did their search.

11:18.945 --> 11:22.380
The protein shake
covered up the oxy scent, ma'am.

So, Jared killed his own client
with a post-workout smoothie.

11:26.420 --> 11:28.653
Except, Lieutenant, Jared
might have gotten away with it

11:28.655 --> 11:30.155
if he hadn't called Andy
for help.

11:30.157 --> 11:33.792

of vanilla protein powder?

11:33.794 --> 11:35.126
Very Vanilla.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.561
It looks okay
to the naked eye.

But up close, you'll see
a mixture of two colors --

11:39.599 --> 11:42.867

and bright white being...

11:42.869 --> 11:44.335

11:44.337 --> 11:46.438
Yeah, maybe that's how the drugs
were getting past Jared.

11:46.440 --> 11:48.239
Yeah, but that's
a lot of oxy, though.

11:48.241 --> 11:50.308
I mean, the whole 2-inch layer
in the middle of the tub?

11:50.310 --> 11:52.077
Any addict

a fatal dose.

drugs in his stomach.

11:57.084 --> 11:58.249
And it wasn't heroin.

11:58.251 --> 12:01.052
He was injecting himself
with HGH.

but not actors.

12:07.661 --> 12:09.461
Half the job
is staying ripped.

But to use HGH,
you need a prescription.

12:11.098 --> 12:12.731

12:12.733 --> 12:14.833
The stuff we found at the house
didn't have pharmacy tags.

12:14.835 --> 12:19.137
So, the fact that Dr. Jared
didn't tell us about this HGH

12:19.139 --> 12:21.372
makes him
sound even more suspicious.

12:21.374 --> 12:23.241
Yeah, but where is
Jared's motive?

12:23.243 --> 12:25.777
He loses
both his job and his future.
