(chuckles)

00:33.967 --> 00:36.668
And then to accelerate the fire,
you can use grease,

00:36.670 --> 00:38.504
which you might find
in ground beef,

00:38.506 --> 00:40.973
which you might find
in my pocket.

00:40.975 --> 00:42.908
(audience gasps)

00:44.677 --> 00:46.578
Thank you,
Cleveland, Jr.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.647
I'll have to send
you to my ex-wife's house.

00:48.649 --> 00:50.382
Just kidding.
Never had sex.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.084
Clean Team, advance.

01:03.830 --> 01:05.230
Boys doing chores.

01:05.232 --> 01:07.032
Mm.

01:07.034 --> 01:08.233
And looking right
in their crisp uniforms.

01:08.235 --> 01:10.769
Yep, everyone
looks good in khaki.

01:10.771 --> 01:13.338
Especially
lady zookeepers.

01:13.340 --> 01:14.339
Mm.

01:14.341 --> 01:15.741
Excuse me, ma'am.

01:15.743 --> 01:17.709
Can I freshen up
your Dixie cup of trail mix?

01:17.711 --> 01:18.844
Thank you.

01:18.846 --> 01:20.612
No yellow raisins.

01:20.614 --> 01:23.782
All these Scouts
are so well-behaved and polite.

01:23.784 --> 01:25.217
Ugh.

01:25.219 --> 01:26.351
How about you,
young man?

01:26.353 --> 01:27.920
A little trail mix?

01:27.922 --> 01:30.389
Gorp... aka "Good Old
Raisins and Peanuts"?

01:30.391 --> 01:31.557
Uh, no.

01:31.559 --> 01:33.692
I prefer Gofu, as in Go F--

01:33.694 --> 01:35.227
Rallo!

01:35.229 --> 01:37.429
You know, you could learn
a thing or two from these boys.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.031
Yeah, like how
to be a kiss-ass.

01:39.033 --> 01:39.965
Dork.

01:39.967 --> 01:41.233
Rallo!

01:41.235 --> 01:42.734
You could
use some of that.

01:42.736 --> 01:44.403
Give you
a better attitude.

01:44.405 --> 01:46.805
The world's got
enough critics.

01:46.807 --> 01:48.640
Little bastard left
a yellow raisin in here.

01:48.642 --> 01:50.409
Attention Freedom Scouts,

01:50.411 --> 01:52.478
Freedom Scout families--

01:52.480 --> 01:54.079
it's time for the raffle.

01:54.081 --> 01:58.283
First up, our third prize,
a massage from a man.

01:58.285 --> 02:01.954
Ticket number... 412.

02:01.956 --> 02:04.156
Number 412.

02:04.158 --> 02:06.658
No one wants
a massage from a man?

02:09.496 --> 02:12.664
Second prize, a walk-on
on <i>The Cleveland Show.</i>

02:12.666 --> 02:14.399
Number 713.

02:16.603 --> 02:17.903
Hi, Gene Oshman.

02:17.905 --> 02:19.071
Big fan, Cleveland.

02:19.073 --> 02:20.973
Mm-hmm.

02:20.975 --> 02:23.609
First prize,
a complimentary weekend

02:23.611 --> 02:26.745
at Stoolbend's new romantic
luxury hotel,

02:26.747 --> 02:29.648
The Bendit Inn,
and a massage from a man.

02:29.650 --> 02:32.017
Number 232.

02:32.019 --> 02:33.619
That's me!

02:33.621 --> 02:35.254
Thank God we can be
away from our children.

02:35.256 --> 02:36.955
Hooray.

02:36.957 --> 02:39.091
Congratsies!

02:39.093 --> 02:40.626
The winner is Donna Tubbs,

02:40.628 --> 02:42.427
mother of one of our Scouts.

02:42.429 --> 02:45.364
Correction:
two of your Scouts.

02:45.366 --> 02:48.367
My son Rallo will be at
your initiation ceremony

02:48.369 --> 02:51.770
on Sunday, so he, too,
can become a Freedom Scout.

02:51.772 --> 02:53.839
What?
How old is he?

02:53.841 --> 02:55.474
Five.

02:55.476 --> 02:57.209
Then he shall be
a Freedom Squirt.

02:57.977 --> 02:59.378
Hi, Karen, hi, kids.

02:59.380 --> 03:01.346
Get your ass
out my shot.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.686
But Mama, I don't want to
join his stupid club.

03:07.688 --> 03:08.887
It's for squares.

03:08.889 --> 03:10.689
Or circles, in his case.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.024
You can do this, Rallo.

03:12.026 --> 03:13.559
All we got to do
is complete your

03:13.561 --> 03:15.561
Freedom Squirt
task checklist.

03:15.563 --> 03:17.062
Oh, is
that all, Junior?

03:17.064 --> 03:17.996
Is that all?

03:17.998 --> 03:19.331
You heard him.

03:19.333 --> 03:21.567
Now, I am going
to a fine hotel,

03:21.569 --> 03:23.969
and when I come home,
I'm gonna have two things:

03:23.971 --> 03:26.638
one, a new bathrobe,
and two,

03:26.640 --> 03:29.708
a polite, respectful
Freedom Squirt for a son.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.476
Or else, no more
dinosaur guys in the bath.

03:31.478 --> 03:32.477
Ever!

03:32.479 --> 03:33.478
Ugh.

03:33.480 --> 03:34.913
Just me and the soap?

03:34.915 --> 03:37.516
(shudders)
You're a monster.

03:37.518 --> 03:39.518
A monster on vacation.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.486
See ya!

03:41.488 --> 03:43.889
(quietly): Donna, I didn't
pack any pajama bottoms.

03:43.891 --> 03:46.158
Roberta's in charge!
Bye!

03:46.160 --> 03:47.993
We better get cracking
if we want to knock out

03:47.995 --> 03:49.661
eight tasks by tuck-in.

03:49.663 --> 03:50.996
I don't want
anything to do with

03:50.998 --> 03:52.431
your goody-goody
khaki cult.

03:52.433 --> 03:54.166
What?!
It's a sham.

03:54.168 --> 03:56.735
Kids being forced to do
"good things"

03:56.737 --> 03:59.404
to get badges
and a pat on the head.

03:59.406 --> 04:02.674
That is, as long as they pay
the initiation fee.

04:02.676 --> 04:04.876
I'm going to open
your heart, Rallo.

04:04.878 --> 04:08.080
And when I'm done,
you'll be a Freedom Squirt.

04:08.082 --> 04:09.181
You know what?

04:09.183 --> 04:10.616
I'm gonna
take the bottoms.

04:10.618 --> 04:13.352
I don't want Donna seeing
my pimply backside.

04:13.354 --> 04:15.120
It's embarrassing.

04:18.224 --> 04:21.693
Not gonna lie, nicest place
I've ever stayed by a lot.

04:21.695 --> 04:23.929
Two lamps.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.530
Honestly, I thought
it would be a little nicer.

04:25.532 --> 04:28.533
(truck beeping)

04:28.535 --> 04:30.369
Cool! Cars!

04:30.371 --> 04:31.737
Lightning McQueen.

04:31.739 --> 04:34.640
Hey, Mater,
you're my friend.

04:34.642 --> 04:37.776
Okay, now that I've
put you in the mood.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.878
Uh-uh!
Not in this room.

04:39.880 --> 04:42.214
Donna, no,
they'll hate us.

04:42.216 --> 04:44.816
Hello, this is
contest winner Donna Tubbs.

04:44.818 --> 04:47.552
We were really
hoping for a garden view.

04:47.554 --> 04:48.654
Please don't
spit in our bed.

04:48.656 --> 04:50.589
Oh, you'd
move us to a new room?

04:50.591 --> 04:52.924
Great! Thank you.

04:52.926 --> 04:55.360
That other room
better have two lamps.

04:56.262 --> 04:59.164
Four lamps?!

05:00.566 --> 05:03.135
Now this
is more like it.

05:03.137 --> 05:06.438
That room over
there has a terrace.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.340
I am so sorry
that one of our maids

05:08.342 --> 05:10.075
left a hair
dryer on in the sink.

05:10.077 --> 05:11.910
Well, I appreciate
that, but still,

05:11.912 --> 05:14.079
I was badly electrocuted.

05:14.081 --> 05:15.681
Look what
happened to her head.

05:15.683 --> 05:17.482
Oh, my God, you look horrible.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.318
Well!

05:19.320 --> 05:21.486
Rest assured, we have
upgraded you to a nicer room.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.155
Can you upgrade her?

05:23.157 --> 05:24.289
How am I supposed
to sleep with that?

05:24.291 --> 05:25.023
(laughing)

05:25.025 --> 05:26.692
Kidding.

05:26.694 --> 05:28.126
Please let
me have some later.

05:28.128 --> 05:29.728
We're at a hotel.

05:34.534 --> 05:36.201
It worked!

05:36.203 --> 05:38.437
And this is the
best room we've had.

05:38.439 --> 05:40.439
So far.

05:44.644 --> 05:46.712
Hi, we've got birds.

05:48.881 --> 05:50.515
All right, six more.

05:50.517 --> 05:53.051
Next up, "Citizenship."

05:53.053 --> 05:56.188
How about helping that
homeless gentleman over there?

05:56.190 --> 05:57.556
He ain't homeless.

05:57.558 --> 05:58.357
He just been at
the beach all day.

05:58.359 --> 06:00.359
Look at that tan.

06:00.361 --> 06:02.127
He's just trying
to scam us, Junior.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.196
Rallo, what's wrong
with you?

06:04.198 --> 06:06.131
I'm so sorry
about that, sir.

06:06.133 --> 06:07.566
Have a chocolate bar.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.267
Thanks, Black Santa.

06:12.638 --> 06:15.974
Wow, Junior, that's a lot of
chocolate, even for you.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.843
I bought 40 boxes of
these to support

06:17.845 --> 06:19.478
the Troubled Youth
Orchestra of Stoolbend.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.246
I'm singlehandedly

06:21.248 --> 06:23.081
sending them to perform
in Norfolk.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.216
Oh, okay.

06:24.218 --> 06:27.085
Some "troubled youths"
sold you these?

06:27.087 --> 06:29.321
Yeah.
And I'm sure they gave you

06:29.323 --> 06:32.524
a great deal
on these 50-cent candy bars.

06:32.526 --> 06:34.659
(chuckling):
Oh, child...

06:34.661 --> 06:36.595
these are not
50-cent candy bars.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.563
They're five-dollar
candy bars.

06:38.565 --> 06:40.432
I see.

06:40.434 --> 06:43.101
And if I were inclined to
support their organization,

06:43.103 --> 06:45.737
where might I acquire
such candy bars?

06:49.776 --> 06:51.243
Send the Troubled
Youth Orchestra of Stoolbend

06:51.245 --> 06:52.844
to the
Norfolk Music Festival.

06:52.846 --> 06:54.546
One year from tonight.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.515
So, you're the kids who
have been taking advantage

06:56.517 --> 06:58.517
of my step-brother,
making him believe

06:58.519 --> 07:01.086
you're an orchestra
gonna go play in Norfolk?

07:01.088 --> 07:02.220
What?!

07:02.222 --> 07:03.688
We're legit.

07:03.690 --> 07:05.524
We got a concert
one year from tonight.

07:05.526 --> 07:06.525
Name an instrument.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.560
Uh... trumpullet?

07:08.562 --> 07:10.128
Lucky guess.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.096
What you want?

07:11.098 --> 07:12.397
What do I want?!

07:12.399 --> 07:14.199
You messed
with my step-kin!

07:14.201 --> 07:15.634
What do you
think I want?

07:15.636 --> 07:17.202
I want in.

07:17.204 --> 07:19.604
50/50 split
on the first six boxes I sell,

07:19.606 --> 07:21.273
60/40 after that.

07:21.275 --> 07:23.742
And at 20 boxes, I get points
on the back end

07:23.744 --> 07:25.644
retroactive to right now.

07:25.646 --> 07:27.579
Kid knows his stuff.

07:27.581 --> 07:30.482
Let's see your begging face.

07:30.484 --> 07:32.651
"Pweez" buy my candy.

07:32.653 --> 07:35.287
I'm "hon-gwy."

07:35.289 --> 07:36.455
I'll take two.

07:36.457 --> 07:37.489
No, Puffs.

07:37.491 --> 07:38.690
You in.

07:40.159 --> 07:42.227
Stay tuned, "Ame-wica."

07:42.229 --> 07:44.863
We need the "watings."

07:51.471 --> 07:53.138
Oh, gee,
this tub was filled

07:53.140 --> 07:54.606
with candy bars
this morning.

07:54.608 --> 07:55.807
But they're gone.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.476
What's in there now?

07:57.478 --> 07:59.077
Boom!

07:59.079 --> 08:01.746
♪Rallo's in a tub of money!

08:01.748 --> 08:02.781
(high-pitched):
♪Money.

08:02.783 --> 08:04.483
(both laughing)

08:04.485 --> 08:06.751
Wow, Rallo!
All that cash is for the

08:06.753 --> 08:08.286
Troubled Youth Orchestra?

08:08.288 --> 08:09.788
(evil laughter)

08:09.790 --> 08:11.756
(sarcastically):
Yeah, right.

08:11.758 --> 08:14.359
I mean, uh... yeah, right.

08:14.361 --> 08:17.162
Always happy to keep
the youths in trumpullets.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.264
I'm so proud of
you, Rallo.

08:19.266 --> 08:22.133
You were so cynical,
but I touched you.

08:22.135 --> 08:23.768
And if I
could touch you,

08:23.770 --> 08:26.004
think of how many
other boys I could touch.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.939
(Junior whistling happily)

08:27.941 --> 08:28.473
(chuckling)

08:32.211 --> 08:35.380
Mm, best vacation
we've ever had.

08:35.382 --> 08:36.648
With all the

08:36.650 --> 08:37.949
"ammeminenities."

08:37.951 --> 08:39.484
(sighs)

08:39.486 --> 08:42.020
Glad we upgraded
to the Presidential Suite.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.289
How could they expect us
to stay in a room

08:44.291 --> 08:47.225
where a "dog" had scooted
across the carpet?

08:47.227 --> 08:48.460
(both laughing)

08:50.830 --> 08:53.064
(siren wailing
in distance)

08:54.834 --> 08:56.468
We're here.

08:56.470 --> 08:59.237
Time for your surprise
for all your hard work.

08:59.239 --> 09:00.639
This looks like Norfolk.

09:00.641 --> 09:01.673
Are we in Norfolk?

09:01.675 --> 09:03.174
Yeah.

09:03.176 --> 09:05.210
For the big Troubled
Youth Orchestra concert.

09:05.212 --> 09:06.878
What?!

09:06.880 --> 09:08.980
Last year, when I bought
my very first candy bar,

09:08.982 --> 09:13.852
they said, "See our big concert,
one year from tonight."

09:13.854 --> 09:16.755
Look, Junior, I think you
might be a bit disappointed.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.256
How could I be?

09:18.258 --> 09:20.191
Just to see the
smile on your face

09:20.193 --> 09:22.861
as you listen to these
needy kids that we've helped.

09:22.863 --> 09:25.397
That will be
music to my eyes.

09:25.399 --> 09:27.165
Ooh, here's the address.

09:27.167 --> 09:30.435
Say, Jim, you standing
in my moon shadow.

09:30.437 --> 09:32.571
Uh, is this where the Troubled
Youth Orchestra is performing?

09:32.573 --> 09:33.838
Oh, yeah, yeah.

09:33.840 --> 09:34.573
They're just tuning up.

09:34.575 --> 09:36.074
Listen.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.944
(farting)

09:38.946 --> 09:42.747
Rallo, there is
no orchestra, is there?

09:42.749 --> 09:44.382
No, big guy.

09:44.384 --> 09:45.951
And the money I've
been giving for candy bars,

09:45.953 --> 09:47.385
you and the rest of those guys

09:47.387 --> 09:49.187
have just been
keeping all of it?

09:49.189 --> 09:51.456
And making it rain at
Toys "R" Us.

09:54.026 --> 09:55.026
Huh.

09:55.028 --> 09:56.061
Good one, Rallo.

09:56.063 --> 09:57.195
You got me.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.798
The old Troubled Youth
Orchestra Trick.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.801
(chuckling): Welp,
better get home to bed.

10:02.803 --> 10:04.869
Got that initiation
in the morning.

10:04.871 --> 10:05.937
Hm.

10:05.939 --> 10:08.039
Fatso's rolling with it.

10:08.041 --> 10:10.175
And I best get my ass
out of this neighborhood.

10:13.713 --> 10:14.713
Checking out?

10:14.715 --> 10:16.147
How was your stay?

10:16.149 --> 10:18.917
Oh, it was very
relaxing, thanks.

10:18.919 --> 10:21.086
Even my husband's
hair is relaxed.

10:21.088 --> 10:22.621
Hi.

10:22.623 --> 10:25.223
That's what
we like to hear.

10:25.225 --> 10:28.460
Okay, your balance is
$3,217.00.

10:28.462 --> 10:30.061
Come again?

10:30.063 --> 10:31.830
Oh, I think there's
a misunderstanding.

10:31.832 --> 10:34.065
See, we're contest winners.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.301
Right, so your room
was free, but you do have

10:36.303 --> 10:37.469
to pay for incidentals,

10:37.471 --> 10:39.270
including in-room dining,

10:39.272 --> 10:41.773
minibar, seven couples
massages, dry cleaning,

10:41.775 --> 10:43.808
midnight swim with the dolphins,

10:43.810 --> 10:46.244
as well as the 72-hour
porn pass you ordered.

10:46.246 --> 10:50.248
For the record, I only used
three minutes of it.

10:50.250 --> 10:53.118
Guess my eyes were
bigger than my hands.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.353
We don't have $3,200!

10:55.355 --> 10:56.821
Don't worry.
I got this.

10:56.823 --> 10:59.324
Birds! Uhp.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.593
Look, if you can't afford
to pay your bill,

11:01.595 --> 11:03.461
you're gonna have
to work it off.

11:03.463 --> 11:04.996
Standard sitcom policy.

11:06.999 --> 11:10.168
Really? This is really the
only uniform you got for me?

11:10.170 --> 11:13.805
Yep. Lots of beefy gals
come through this place.

11:13.807 --> 11:17.709
Now, I believe the toilet
in 416 is clogged.

11:17.711 --> 11:19.678
Lots of beefy guests, too.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.079
(both sigh)

11:23.549 --> 11:25.850
Hiya, a-roonie-yah!

11:25.852 --> 11:28.153
Hiya, a-scoonie-yah!

11:28.155 --> 11:33.324
Hiya, soota dada yo-yo
da-baba, yah!

11:33.326 --> 11:34.826
So you're sure
you're cool with me

11:34.828 --> 11:35.660
going through with this?

11:35.662 --> 11:37.295
So cool.

11:42.068 --> 11:44.402
And now to launch
our Pre-Squirts

11:44.404 --> 11:47.038
into full-fledged
Freedom Squirtdom,

11:47.040 --> 11:49.674
Chief Scout
Cleveland Brown, Jr.!

11:49.676 --> 11:52.877
(applause, mic feedback whines)

11:52.879 --> 11:55.547
Well, here they are,
Freedom Squirt badges--

11:55.549 --> 11:58.850
symbols of trust, honesty,
and integrity.

11:58.852 --> 12:01.186
In other words, total bullcrap!

12:01.188 --> 12:02.153
(all gasp)

12:02.155 --> 12:03.988
Hiya, what the...?!

12:03.990 --> 12:06.758
That's right, kids--
might as well tell you now:

12:06.760 --> 12:09.160
It's a soulless world
full of bad people

12:09.162 --> 12:10.895
who screw you at every turn.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.297
Scout's honor.

12:13.332 --> 12:14.899
I quit!

12:14.901 --> 12:16.401
(all gasp)

12:16.403 --> 12:17.769
(woman gasps,
audience murmuring)

12:18.404 --> 12:20.371
Junior, wait!

12:20.373 --> 12:21.740
Buy some chocolates
for the road?

12:21.742 --> 12:23.241
Screw you, Rallo!

12:23.243 --> 12:24.242
Yeah, I'll take seven.

12:30.282 --> 12:32.917
Oh, look, there's cheese stuck
to the top of the box,

12:32.919 --> 12:35.854
cooling and congealing,
turning into cheese gum.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.689
Gee, who's
gonna eat that?

12:37.691 --> 12:40.191
I'll take it!
(sighs)

12:41.127 --> 12:42.360
Thanks, bros.

12:42.362 --> 12:43.795
Pizza-pizza!

12:43.797 --> 12:46.131
So, you're really
quitting the Scouts?

12:46.133 --> 12:47.232
I thought that was,
like, you know,

12:47.234 --> 12:49.634
the most important
thing in your life.

12:49.636 --> 12:51.469
A lot of stupid crap was
important to me

12:51.471 --> 12:53.872
before I woke up.
Thanks for opening my eyes

12:53.874 --> 12:55.874
to what the world's
really like, Rallo.

12:55.876 --> 12:58.109
Well, I gotta admit,
it's nice to finally have

12:58.111 --> 13:01.246
someone around this house
who sees things the way I do.

13:01.248 --> 13:02.647
It's every man
for himself, right?

13:03.315 --> 13:06.084
Yeah, it is.

13:06.086 --> 13:07.619
(clears throat)

13:07.621 --> 13:09.788
Okay. You got me.

13:09.790 --> 13:12.423
Hey, you forgot Larry
the Leopard!

13:12.425 --> 13:13.858
(screams)

13:17.630 --> 13:20.098
I bet Nell Carter
didn't have to do this (bleep).

13:20.100 --> 13:22.500
All she had to do was vacuum
the fish tank once a week.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.002
CLEVELAND:
Help!

13:24.004 --> 13:25.770
It happened again!

13:25.772 --> 13:29.340
I cannot figure out
these hospital corners!

13:29.342 --> 13:31.142
(gasping)

13:31.144 --> 13:33.077
I'll make the bed,
Cleveland.

13:33.079 --> 13:35.180
You go over to 414
and start wiping out

13:35.182 --> 13:37.081
the bathtub
with the comforter.

13:42.788 --> 13:45.089
Mm, warm oysters.

13:45.091 --> 13:48.293
Don't mind if I do.

13:48.295 --> 13:51.763
Probably not much has
happened on this carpet.

13:51.765 --> 13:53.164
Ah...

13:53.166 --> 13:56.100
Does that butt go
all the way around?

13:56.102 --> 13:57.268
Aflac!

13:57.937 --> 13:59.871
(both scream)

13:59.873 --> 14:01.372
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:01.374 --> 14:02.674
I thought you were
a woman I could victimize.

14:02.676 --> 14:04.042
How dare you?!

14:04.044 --> 14:06.477
Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm.

14:06.479 --> 14:08.780
Hungry...

14:08.782 --> 14:11.316
And I'm getting that oyster
underneath the dresser!

14:11.318 --> 14:14.152
No funny business!

14:14.154 --> 14:16.554
Ooh, there's two down here!

14:16.556 --> 14:18.122
Oop! No, that's an ear.

14:23.162 --> 14:24.395
Muppets, huh?

14:24.397 --> 14:25.396
You know, Kermit's dead.

14:25.398 --> 14:26.831
What?

14:26.833 --> 14:29.534
Guy who did his voice died
of a bacterial infection.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.903
Sore throat one day,
next day, he croaked.

14:31.905 --> 14:33.204
Ha-ha.

14:33.206 --> 14:35.340
Aw... (sighs)

14:35.342 --> 14:37.742
Oh, and all those phones
and tablets?

14:37.744 --> 14:39.244
Made in Chinese factories

14:39.246 --> 14:42.413
where conditions are so bad,
the workers commit suicide.

14:42.415 --> 14:43.915
Can you hear me now?
No?

14:43.917 --> 14:46.217
Oh, right!
'Cause you're dead.

14:47.086 --> 14:48.419
How's a man supposed

14:48.421 --> 14:51.589
to fling a bird at
a pig after that?

14:51.591 --> 14:54.325
What? At least he's not
the chump he used to be.

14:54.327 --> 14:57.262
Oh, yeah, he was a chump
because while you were being

14:57.264 --> 14:59.831
too cool for life,
he actually tried

14:59.833 --> 15:03.201
to see the best in people
and was happy.

15:03.203 --> 15:04.903
And he walked through the world

15:04.905 --> 15:07.405
carrying the tiny candle
of hope,

15:07.407 --> 15:11.109
shielding it against the
bitter winds of negativity.

15:11.111 --> 15:14.279
He kept it alive for so long,

15:14.281 --> 15:17.282
through his parents' divorce
and his mom's death

15:17.284 --> 15:19.918
and a 200-pound weight gain,

15:19.920 --> 15:24.022
always with a sweet smile
and that little candle.

15:24.024 --> 15:28.526
And then you come along,
Rallo, and what do you do?

15:28.528 --> 15:29.727
(blows air)

15:29.729 --> 15:31.729
Aah! You're right!

15:31.731 --> 15:33.731
I broke his big fat heart!

15:33.733 --> 15:35.400
I'm a bad person!

15:35.402 --> 15:37.535
I'm going straight to heck!

15:37.537 --> 15:39.370
Holy (bleep), man!

15:39.372 --> 15:43.141
(Cleveland sobbing)

15:43.143 --> 15:45.443
He touched you through
three layers of clothes.

15:45.445 --> 15:46.911
There's nothing
to wash off!

15:46.913 --> 15:48.579
He harassed me, Donna!

15:48.581 --> 15:51.549
No, actually, since I'm
a man, he "hisassed" me!

15:51.551 --> 15:52.583
I'll sue him!

15:52.585 --> 15:54.052
Wish you could.

15:54.054 --> 15:55.653
Then we could pay off
this hotel bill.

15:55.655 --> 15:58.323
And we could stop him
from harassing other women

15:58.325 --> 16:00.725
with irresistible butts
like mine!

16:00.727 --> 16:02.393
All we need is proof.

16:02.395 --> 16:04.329
But he'd never do it
to me again

16:04.331 --> 16:06.097
after I rejected
him so rudely.

16:06.099 --> 16:08.700
Wait! Donna, you could
pass for a woman!

16:10.235 --> 16:11.903
(knocking on door)

16:11.905 --> 16:13.237
(sultry):
Housekeeping.

16:17.343 --> 16:19.577
The sting is on.

16:19.579 --> 16:23.247
All right, Donna, shake your
large-settlement maker.

16:23.249 --> 16:25.750
Well, what about the
financial earnings
projection numbers?

16:25.752 --> 16:27.151
Down?

16:27.153 --> 16:28.753
Damn, I was hoping for up.

16:28.755 --> 16:33.124
Wow, sounds like you're
a really hands-on manager.

16:33.126 --> 16:35.159
Hold on. Could you
come back later?

16:35.161 --> 16:37.996
I'm on a business call.

16:37.998 --> 16:40.598
I bet you're in
the donkey business,

16:40.600 --> 16:43.501
because you seem
like a real ass man.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.169
Hey! Get the hell
out of here!

16:45.171 --> 16:46.537
Damn it, Donna!
She's losing him!

16:46.539 --> 16:48.673
Guess he likes 'em pimply.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.675
Gals, we're going in!

16:50.677 --> 16:53.945
Hi, here I am.
Another maid.

16:53.947 --> 16:55.513
I've got what you want,

16:55.515 --> 16:58.116
and I'm about to give you
what you need.

16:58.717 --> 17:00.151
Wait. It's you!

17:00.153 --> 17:01.552
You're sick!

17:01.554 --> 17:03.054
Am I?
Am I sick?!

17:03.056 --> 17:05.323
Or are you sick,
because you're starving

17:05.325 --> 17:09.394
for $3,217
worth of this!

17:09.396 --> 17:10.862
You people are crazy!

17:10.864 --> 17:11.996
I'm a businessman!

17:11.998 --> 17:12.797
After him!

17:20.172 --> 17:21.506
(elevator bell dings)

17:21.508 --> 17:22.373
(grunts)

17:25.044 --> 17:27.178
Please, just leave me alone!
(whimpers)

17:27.180 --> 17:29.180
Come on, just one grope!

17:29.182 --> 17:32.850
CLEVELAND & DONNA:
Ass, ass, ass, ass...

17:32.852 --> 17:35.219
HOTEL MANAGER:
Needless to say, this is odd.

17:35.221 --> 17:37.055
And unacceptable.

17:37.057 --> 17:40.058
We did this to stand up for
women and butts everywhere!

17:40.060 --> 17:41.325
Well, all you've done

17:41.327 --> 17:43.027
is out-creep
a serial ass-grabber.

17:43.029 --> 17:44.495
You're fired!

17:44.497 --> 17:46.998
But I love it here!
What about our debt?

17:47.000 --> 17:49.267
No amount of money is worth
ever again having to visualize

17:49.269 --> 17:51.202
the two of you having sex.

17:51.204 --> 17:54.872
Yeah, we had all 16 lamps off
in the Presidential Suite.

17:54.874 --> 17:55.940
Get out!

18:00.379 --> 18:01.679
Fart that.

18:01.681 --> 18:03.214
We not playin' nothin'.

18:03.216 --> 18:06.084
Huh.
Sure would be a shame

18:06.086 --> 18:09.253
if your parole officers found
out about your little scam.

18:09.255 --> 18:10.755
'Cause we all know
that everyone

18:10.757 --> 18:12.924
with a nickname
is on parole.

18:12.926 --> 18:16.461
That means you, Blades,
Puffs, Loafer,

18:16.463 --> 18:18.196
even you, Plurals.

18:18.198 --> 18:19.797
I only got one strikes!

18:19.799 --> 18:21.466
I'm not rolling back
to juvie!

18:21.468 --> 18:23.234
Those 'mos will take away
my blades!

18:23.236 --> 18:26.737
Then you all have four hours
to learn this song.

18:26.739 --> 18:27.872
You're gonna convince

18:27.874 --> 18:30.108
an alarmingly gullible
14-year-old

18:30.110 --> 18:32.243
that you're the most
musically talented

18:32.245 --> 18:36.314
scam artists since
the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.

18:36.316 --> 18:38.483
That dudes is a dicks.

18:39.618 --> 18:41.385
Great! A community center.

18:41.387 --> 18:43.154
Is this the one
with the asbestos

18:43.156 --> 18:45.923
or the one where all
the senior citizens
were clubbed to death?

18:45.925 --> 18:49.060
No, it's the one
that had e coli in
the swimming pool.

18:49.062 --> 18:51.996
Now I'm glad you got that
negativity out of your system,

18:51.998 --> 18:55.233
'cause you're about to see
something inspirational.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.667
Fart that.

18:56.669 --> 18:57.668
Just sit down.

18:58.737 --> 19:00.905
Junior, you've lost your way.

19:00.907 --> 19:03.307
But I'm gonna make you
believe again.

19:03.309 --> 19:05.076
It's show time!

19:05.078 --> 19:06.511
(gasps)

19:06.513 --> 19:08.613
You got them to sit
with instruments!

19:08.615 --> 19:10.081
Wait, there's more.

19:10.083 --> 19:14.352
And one, one, one-one-one-one.

19:14.354 --> 19:15.820

Like This" off-key)

19:15.822 --> 19:20.491
♪What if I told you
it was all meant to be? ♪

19:20.493 --> 19:22.326

19:22.328 --> 19:26.264

would you agree? ♪

19:26.266 --> 19:28.332

All the way back.

19:30.436 --> 19:32.670

19:57.796 --> 19:58.896
You see that?

19:58.898 --> 20:01.132
There is a Troubled
Youth Orchestra.

20:01.134 --> 20:03.167
They weren't just
scamming people!

20:03.169 --> 20:06.204
I guess people  <i>are</i> good,
huh, Junior?

20:06.206 --> 20:07.872
I don't know about them.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.840
But I know  <i>you're</i> good.

20:09.842 --> 20:12.910
What?
I wasn't born yesterday, Rallo.

20:12.912 --> 20:15.079
Those guys sounded awful.

20:15.081 --> 20:16.681
I don't know how
you got them to play,

20:16.683 --> 20:18.816
but I know you did.

20:18.818 --> 20:21.185
Which means you've
got a good heart.

20:21.187 --> 20:22.553
(gasps)

20:22.555 --> 20:25.022
And if you do, then
maybe everybody does.

20:25.024 --> 20:28.659
And if that's true, the world
<i>i</i>a beautiful place.

20:30.028 --> 20:31.796
Welcome back, Freedom Scout.

20:33.265 --> 20:35.099
You got me a new sash!

20:35.101 --> 20:37.335
Actually, it's three,
sewn together.

20:37.337 --> 20:38.936
A perfect fit.

20:38.938 --> 20:40.905
Hold on-- I was
sucking my gut in.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.607
(exhales, groans)

20:44.443 --> 20:46.244
(eerie music playing)

20:46.246 --> 20:48.312
(blinds banging
against window frame)

20:56.021 --> 20:57.521
(deep, raspy voice):
I'm gonna kill you, Junior.
