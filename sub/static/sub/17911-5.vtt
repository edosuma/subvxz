00:01.067 --> 00:03.667
(gentle music)

00:08.233 --> 00:09.067
(car alarm ringing)

00:09.067 --> 00:11.800
(upbeat music)

00:11.800 --> 00:13.000
* Come on home

00:13.000 --> 00:14.467
* Coming home baby now

00:14.467 --> 00:16.033
* You know I'm
waiting here for you *

00:16.033 --> 00:18.633
* I'm coming home
now real soon *

00:18.633 --> 00:19.833
* You've been gone

00:19.833 --> 00:21.067
* Coming home baby now

00:21.067 --> 00:22.700
* You don't know what
I'm going through *

00:22.700 --> 00:25.000
* I'm coming home I
know I'm overdue *

00:25.000 --> 00:26.333
* Since you went away

00:26.333 --> 00:29.533
* Expect me any
day now real soon *

00:29.533 --> 00:31.900
* I'm coming home and
never more to roam *

00:31.900 --> 00:36.900
* Baby tell me
you're coming home *

00:37.933 --> 00:38.767
* I'm coming home

00:38.767 --> 00:40.833
* Come on home

00:40.833 --> 00:43.700
(upbeat music)

00:43.700 --> 00:47.200
(engine roaring)

00:47.200 --> 00:50.000
(brakes squealing)

00:50.000 --> 00:53.433
- It's just me, there was
a gas leak in the building

00:53.433 --> 00:55.900
which pretty sure it's
just that new guy Brian

00:55.900 --> 00:57.367
and his lentil salads

00:57.367 --> 00:59.733
but we all got sent
home a bit early.

01:03.600 --> 01:04.533
Where are you?

01:04.533 --> 01:06.067
- I'm at home.

01:06.067 --> 01:07.267
- Are you?

01:07.267 --> 01:09.533
- Yap, doing homework,
smashing out some maths

01:09.533 --> 01:10.533
How's work going?

01:10.533 --> 01:11.367
Oh, crap.

01:17.700 --> 01:19.100
- Smashing out some
maths, were you?

01:19.100 --> 01:20.600
What kind of maths was it?

01:20.600 --> 01:22.733
If one idiot gets together
with another idiot

01:22.733 --> 01:24.767
and they drive for half
a day in a shit box,

01:24.767 --> 01:25.967
how many hours of his future

01:25.967 --> 01:27.700
has the first idiot thrown away?

01:27.700 --> 01:28.933
What is she doing back in town?

01:28.933 --> 01:30.167
- You mean Ashley?

01:30.167 --> 01:31.233
- Did she run out of
vegetables to cuddle?

01:31.233 --> 01:32.167
- She came to see me.

01:32.167 --> 01:33.633
- She doesn't get to see you.

01:33.633 --> 01:34.767
- Can I have a drink please?

01:34.767 --> 01:36.100
- Well you are supposed
to be at school.

01:36.100 --> 01:37.600
- Seriously, I'm thirsty.

01:37.600 --> 01:40.267
- Tell her to come back in two
years when you're finished.

01:40.267 --> 01:41.067
- I finish now.

01:45.533 --> 01:46.367
I'm dropping out.

01:47.333 --> 01:48.633
- I beg your pardon?

01:48.633 --> 01:51.133
- For a while, I'm
taking a gap year.

01:51.133 --> 01:52.433
- You're in year 11.

01:52.433 --> 01:54.800
- Ashley and I are
going to India.

01:54.800 --> 01:56.167
- I'm going to the
Maldives with the Clooneys,

01:56.167 --> 01:57.333
we can all catch up.

01:57.333 --> 01:58.867
- I'm not joking.

01:58.867 --> 02:02.767
- This is, oh okay. Is Cain in
here filming this somewhere?

02:02.767 --> 02:03.833
- I'm leaving school.

02:04.933 --> 02:07.067
- You are not leaving
school, Shawn.

02:07.933 --> 02:10.767
(engines roaring)

02:12.633 --> 02:15.367
- So we can use the patella
tendon for the autograph

02:15.367 --> 02:17.433
and the tissue would then
run through the bones

02:17.433 --> 02:18.833
to perform a new ACL.

02:18.833 --> 02:21.067
- Whoa, doc, I
don't think we need

02:21.067 --> 02:22.867
to hear about bones
and tissues, do we?

02:22.867 --> 02:24.067
- Well if your
wife is gonna have

02:24.067 --> 02:25.800
a new knee, then yes we do.

02:25.800 --> 02:27.567
- We couldn't just try some more

02:27.567 --> 02:29.500
cortisone injections could we?

02:29.500 --> 02:30.733
- It's a complete tear now.

02:30.733 --> 02:31.900
- I don't wanna tell you how to

02:31.900 --> 02:34.733
do your job Dr.
Larson, but look here,

02:36.800 --> 02:40.367
I can't see a tear in the knee.

02:41.300 --> 02:43.067
- That's because it's a hip

02:43.067 --> 02:45.333
which belongs to
my last patient.

02:45.333 --> 02:48.067
- Wayne, put the Texta down?

02:49.767 --> 02:51.700
- Now my waiting
list is fairly long.

02:51.700 --> 02:53.133
- Oh, I don't mind.

02:53.133 --> 02:54.800
I've gotta wait to get
through the Winternats anyway.

02:54.800 --> 02:55.833
- The Winternats?

02:55.833 --> 02:57.400
- The Winternationals.

02:57.400 --> 02:59.067
It's the biggest date on the
racing calendar and Julz is

02:59.067 --> 03:03.233
- Oh no, until you have this
operation, you can't race.

03:03.233 --> 03:06.300
- Just wanna rub
out, was that a?

03:06.300 --> 03:08.933
- Yes. Was it a
permanent marker.

03:08.933 --> 03:10.267
- Permanent marker.

03:10.267 --> 03:11.600
(man whispering)

03:11.600 --> 03:13.167
Just wait a minute.

03:13.167 --> 03:15.400
- Oscar, Eddie dinner.

03:15.400 --> 03:19.067
- No, this expedition to Cradle
Mountain sounds grueling.

03:19.067 --> 03:20.300
It's not compulsory, is it?

03:20.300 --> 03:21.767
- Should be.

03:21.767 --> 03:23.067
- Well, I don't want Oscar
and Edwina doing this.

03:23.067 --> 03:24.767
- Can you imagine if
they dragged all those

03:24.767 --> 03:27.967
entitled Thrussington brats
in the wilderness for 10 days?

03:27.967 --> 03:29.400
- But our kids aren't
entitled brats.

03:29.400 --> 03:30.400
- No, no, no. We've
been through this.

03:30.400 --> 03:31.700
Our kids are perfect.

03:31.700 --> 03:33.633
- Shawn's dropping
out of school.

03:33.633 --> 03:34.467
- Can I dropped out of school?

03:34.467 --> 03:35.900
- He's going traveling.

03:35.900 --> 03:36.733
- Can I go traveling?

03:36.733 --> 03:37.567
- With his girlfriend.

03:37.567 --> 03:39.467
- Can I get a, oh no.

03:39.467 --> 03:41.100
- Oh, that's terrible.

03:41.100 --> 03:42.767
Amber will be very upset.

03:42.767 --> 03:45.233
- She's gone mental,
he's such an idiot.

03:45.233 --> 03:47.300
I mean, I know it's
harder for him but still.

03:47.300 --> 03:48.767
- Why is it harder for him?

03:48.767 --> 03:50.400
- Because he has to work harder.

03:50.400 --> 03:52.300
- Because he's not
as smart as we are?

03:53.500 --> 03:55.367
- No, because he doesn't
get the opportunity

03:55.367 --> 03:56.933
handed to him like we do.

03:56.933 --> 03:58.433
- What opportunity?

03:58.433 --> 03:59.567
- At our school,

04:01.800 --> 04:03.267
the extra teachers,

04:03.267 --> 04:05.067
the beautiful classrooms,

04:05.067 --> 04:06.600
the swimming pool.

04:06.600 --> 04:07.533
- The state of the art cinema.

04:07.533 --> 04:09.367
- The trips to Europe and China.

04:09.367 --> 04:10.300
- The boats.

04:10.300 --> 04:12.067
- A biomedical research lab.

04:12.067 --> 04:14.233
- The fees that could
buy a Pacific island.

04:17.767 --> 04:19.200
- Cradle map.

04:19.200 --> 04:21.233
- Yep. Give me the permission
slip, I'll fill it out.

04:21.233 --> 04:23.833
(upbeat music)

04:29.533 --> 04:32.067
- Now this will
cheer you up mom.

04:32.067 --> 04:35.067
- How do you get the
duck inside the chicken?

04:35.067 --> 04:36.600
- It's chicken inside duck.

04:36.600 --> 04:37.967
- Inside Turkey.

04:37.967 --> 04:39.300
- Tone out and pop.

04:39.300 --> 04:40.500
- Are you guys
here for turducken?

04:40.500 --> 04:42.367
- He wants to drop
out of school.

04:42.367 --> 04:45.133
- Not drop out, take a gap year.

04:45.133 --> 04:46.367
- A gap year?

04:46.367 --> 04:47.967
- Like Hamish and Andy,
that looked like fun.

04:47.967 --> 04:50.100
What was the one with
the monkey and the beer?

04:50.100 --> 04:51.067
(man laughing)

04:51.067 --> 04:52.200
- It's not something fun dad,

04:52.200 --> 04:54.467
he wants to go to India
with a girlfriend.

04:54.467 --> 04:57.900
- Ashley. I'm so sick of school,

04:57.900 --> 05:00.067
and I wanna learn
about the real world.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.567
- And who's going to pay
for you in the real world

05:01.567 --> 05:03.700
when you're laid out in a
Mumbai hostile with Guardia?

05:03.700 --> 05:04.633
- Ashley.

05:04.633 --> 05:06.167
- Sit down sweetie, sit down.

05:07.133 --> 05:09.500
Do you want some turducken?

05:09.500 --> 05:11.100
- It is massive in America.

05:11.100 --> 05:12.800
- I'm not eating
meat at the moment.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.067
- Oh.

05:14.067 --> 05:15.800
- That is so rude,
this took us ages.

05:15.800 --> 05:17.267
Babe let's get plates.

05:17.267 --> 05:22.267
- Listen Shawnee, I know you
want a break from school, I do.

05:23.433 --> 05:25.267
But we don't want
you to go to India.

05:25.267 --> 05:30.267
We want you to stay here,
drive in the Winternats for us.

05:30.733 --> 05:32.200
- What?

05:32.200 --> 05:34.100
- You got my text from
the doctor, I can't race.

05:34.100 --> 05:35.533
- Shawn can't either.

05:35.533 --> 05:36.967
- Well, it's only
a couple of ways.

05:36.967 --> 05:37.900
- He has exams.

05:37.900 --> 05:39.200
- I'm happy to homeschool.

05:39.200 --> 05:40.300
- No.

05:40.300 --> 05:41.833
- What about Nan?

05:41.833 --> 05:44.733
- I'm not racing, I'm leaving
school and I'm going to India.

05:48.067 --> 05:50.767
- Congratulations,
grandparents of the year.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.333
- I thought it was
helping us all out.

05:52.333 --> 05:53.467
- Yeah right.

05:55.933 --> 05:57.200
- What about me?

05:57.200 --> 05:59.133
- Oh, you can have the
other turkey leg mate.

05:59.133 --> 06:01.567
- I wanna step up to race.

06:01.567 --> 06:03.533
I know that Jen is
better than anyone.

06:03.533 --> 06:06.533
I know her inside
out, I can do this.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.200
- You didn't want to
raise in the juniors.

06:08.200 --> 06:09.933
- Yes I did, but I
didn't get a chance

06:09.933 --> 06:11.300
because I was the
only one who could

06:11.300 --> 06:12.800
mechanically service mom's car.

06:12.800 --> 06:14.133
And Brianna's car in the juniors

06:14.133 --> 06:16.267
and Shawn's car in
the junior juniors.

06:18.633 --> 06:20.100
- I'm not sure.

06:20.100 --> 06:22.600
- Well we won't be sure unless
we give it a go. Will we?

06:24.133 --> 06:26.767
So come on, let's give it a go.

06:26.767 --> 06:28.367
- Yes. Yes.

06:28.367 --> 06:30.933
(upbeat music)

06:40.867 --> 06:41.700
(door knocking)

06:41.700 --> 06:42.933
- Mr. Janko.

06:42.933 --> 06:44.067
Sorry. There was no
one out of the front.

06:44.067 --> 06:44.833
So I just came back.

06:44.833 --> 06:45.667
- Sharon.

06:49.067 --> 06:49.833
Edina.

06:52.100 --> 06:53.567
Lexie.

06:53.567 --> 06:55.100
- I'm Amber Wheeler.

06:55.100 --> 06:57.100
- Sorry. You need to make
an appointment to see me.

06:57.100 --> 06:57.900
- I can see now.

06:57.900 --> 06:59.133
- Well, I'm busy.

06:59.133 --> 07:00.733
- You looked busy
out the window.

07:03.433 --> 07:06.100
- You got a couple minutes.

07:06.100 --> 07:08.833
- I want to talk to you about
my son, Shawn Van Winkle.

07:09.700 --> 07:11.267
He wants to drop out of school.

07:13.367 --> 07:16.067
- And what do you want
me to do about that?

07:16.067 --> 07:17.300
- Gee, I don't know.

07:17.300 --> 07:19.833
I just thought you being
the principal and all.

07:19.833 --> 07:21.067
- Yep. No worries.

07:21.067 --> 07:23.300
I'll just put that
on my principal pad

07:23.300 --> 07:24.800
and I'll use my principal pen.

07:24.800 --> 07:27.600
And add that to my list
of principal things to do,

07:27.600 --> 07:29.600
just under rebuild the
back fence of the oval,

07:29.600 --> 07:31.367
that's burnt to the
ground twice this year.

07:31.367 --> 07:34.100
Fix the leaking roofs of six
of the 14 portable classrooms.

07:34.100 --> 07:36.400
Had them for 11 years
temporary, they were.

07:36.400 --> 07:38.667
Launch an investigation
into the missing drum kit.

07:38.667 --> 07:40.200
That's three stolen this term,

07:40.200 --> 07:42.767
and arrange counseling for
nine of our staff members

07:42.767 --> 07:45.233
that are currently on light
library duty due to stress.

07:45.233 --> 07:46.800
We don't have a
library, but listen,

07:46.800 --> 07:48.067
just to the bottom
here I'll add,

07:48.067 --> 07:52.333
get Shawn to stay in school.

07:52.333 --> 07:53.400
There you go.

07:57.400 --> 08:00.367
What are you doing
with my stapler?

08:01.767 --> 08:03.067
And my pot plant?

08:03.067 --> 08:04.900
- My taxes pay for
this shit hole.

08:04.900 --> 08:07.800
You're not educating my son,
I want something for my money.

08:09.433 --> 08:11.567
The fish rots from
the head, by the way.

08:16.400 --> 08:18.967
(upbeat music)

08:41.733 --> 08:42.600
- You all right man?

08:42.600 --> 08:44.233
- Love it. Love it.

08:44.233 --> 08:45.500
So good to be out here.

08:47.667 --> 08:49.067
- What are you doing?

08:49.067 --> 08:50.133
- Getting into the zone.

08:50.133 --> 08:51.567
- Good boy.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.467
- I don't think
he's ready for this.

08:55.467 --> 08:57.067
- Babe we've got six weeks
until the Winternats.

08:57.067 --> 08:59.900
- I mean, I don't think
he's ready up here.

08:59.900 --> 09:03.367
- No, no. He's just told you,
he's getting in the zone.

09:03.367 --> 09:04.567
- What, for an MMA tournament?

09:04.567 --> 09:05.433
- Well what do
you want us to do?

09:05.433 --> 09:06.433
Drop out of the comp?

09:06.433 --> 09:07.533
- No, of course not.

09:07.533 --> 09:08.900
- Then stop being so negative.

09:08.900 --> 09:10.600
Wow, here we go.

09:12.300 --> 09:13.800
- What's Tony doing here?

09:13.800 --> 09:17.900
- Surprise. Tony has become
a Top Fuel instructor.

09:17.900 --> 09:19.333
He's bought his dual cab

09:19.333 --> 09:21.233
so you can ride shotgun
a couple of times.

09:21.233 --> 09:23.267
That'll get you in the zone.

09:23.267 --> 09:24.400
- Awesome.

09:24.400 --> 09:25.733
(upbeat music)

09:25.733 --> 09:27.067
- Whoa.

09:27.067 --> 09:27.833
(Julie laughing)

09:27.833 --> 09:28.667
- There he is.

09:28.667 --> 09:29.500
- Tony.

09:29.500 --> 09:30.733
- There she is.

09:30.733 --> 09:31.900
- How are you?

09:34.633 --> 09:36.633
- Oh my God, yeah.

09:36.633 --> 09:38.800
- There's Wayne.

09:38.800 --> 09:41.567
- No, this one
says zero degrees.

09:41.567 --> 09:43.400
I think we need
something warmer.

09:43.400 --> 09:45.533
- The checklist says that
zero degrees is fine.

09:45.533 --> 09:47.433
- It's Cradle Mountain.
It'd be freezing.

09:47.433 --> 09:48.633
What about backpacks?

09:48.633 --> 09:50.100
- Yes. I'm checking them out.

09:50.100 --> 09:51.267
No, no, no.

09:53.833 --> 09:55.733
Oh, does it say
anything about a tent?

09:55.733 --> 09:59.900
- No, no tent.

09:59.900 --> 10:02.833
- It's a shame. I've got some
great tents for Sub-Zero here.

10:02.833 --> 10:04.933
Oscar, I'll call you back.

10:04.933 --> 10:05.767
- Okay, bye.

10:07.300 --> 10:08.667
- The school supplies tents

10:08.667 --> 10:09.900
and we already have backpacks.

10:09.900 --> 10:11.533
- We just want Oscar
to be comfortable.

10:11.533 --> 10:12.867
- If you want him
to be comfortable,

10:12.867 --> 10:14.767
why are you sending him
off like Bear Grylls

10:14.767 --> 10:17.067
having to drink his own urine?

10:17.067 --> 10:18.600
- That's not on the checklist.

10:18.600 --> 10:20.067
- We don't want him
to feel entitled.

10:20.067 --> 10:21.000
- Why not?

10:21.000 --> 10:22.100
My grandfather worked very hard

10:22.100 --> 10:23.733
so we could all feel entitled.

10:23.733 --> 10:26.233
- Nanny Margaret Oscar has
no idea how lucky he is.

10:26.233 --> 10:27.733
- Oscar has no
idea about anything

10:27.733 --> 10:29.100
and that won't
change If he spends

10:29.100 --> 10:31.233
10 days defecating in the snow.

10:31.233 --> 10:33.500
- You have to stop watching
the Discovery Channel.

10:33.500 --> 10:34.867
- He has to realize
that not everything's

10:34.867 --> 10:36.233
handed to him on a platter.

10:37.433 --> 10:39.133
- Oh, I wonder if Danny
got him hiking boots.

10:39.133 --> 10:40.933
- He has hiking boots.

10:40.933 --> 10:42.467
- Oh the old ones are so dirty.

10:42.467 --> 10:44.500
- Because they're hiking boots.

10:44.500 --> 10:46.533
- Yeah, no you're right.

10:46.533 --> 10:48.767
That is true.

10:48.767 --> 10:50.200
- You're telling
dad to get new ones.

10:50.200 --> 10:51.000
Aren't you?

10:53.767 --> 10:56.600
- The old ones laces
are really frayed.

10:56.600 --> 10:59.133
(upbeat music)

11:00.400 --> 11:01.900
- So riding in the
front with Tony

11:01.900 --> 11:03.467
will be the perfect
way to ease into it.

11:03.467 --> 11:05.733
- Absolutely no pressure.

11:05.733 --> 11:08.400
- Kayne, speak to me.

11:08.400 --> 11:09.633
- Hi Tony.

11:09.633 --> 11:12.067
- Starting line,
arms outstretched.

11:12.067 --> 11:13.467
Look at the Christmas tree,

11:13.467 --> 11:15.433
Amber lights, 0.4 of a
second later what happens?

11:15.433 --> 11:16.267
- We turn.
(fingers snapping)

11:16.267 --> 11:17.800
- Too slow, green light.

11:17.800 --> 11:19.933
Did you release the handbrake,
100th of a second beforehand?

11:19.933 --> 11:20.900
- Yes.

11:20.900 --> 11:21.900
- Then go.

11:21.900 --> 11:23.167
Four G-forces at
that start line.

11:23.167 --> 11:24.633
Who else feels that, Kayne?

11:24.633 --> 11:26.333
An astronaut

11:26.333 --> 11:28.233
0.8 of a second, how
fast are you going?

11:28.233 --> 11:29.067
- About.

11:29.067 --> 11:30.067
- Wrong.

11:30.067 --> 11:32.833
160km/h. Accelerate. Accelerate.

11:32.833 --> 11:34.733
2.2 seconds, how fast
you going now, Kayne?

11:34.733 --> 11:37.433
320km/h. Do you feel it?

11:37.433 --> 11:41.733
10,000 horsepower surging
through your bones.

11:41.733 --> 11:44.233
Four-second mark, put on the
brake, release the chute.

11:44.233 --> 11:46.200
That's eight negative
G-forces, Kayne.

11:46.200 --> 11:47.367
Brake's on, chute's out,

11:47.367 --> 11:49.367
six seconds, we are done.

11:49.367 --> 11:50.200
- Woo.

11:50.200 --> 11:51.067
- Ooh.

11:51.067 --> 11:52.333
- Woo.

11:52.333 --> 11:53.600
- Actually feel like
I've been for a run.

11:53.600 --> 11:54.567
Why don't we go
and have a coffee

11:54.567 --> 11:55.467
and talk about the whole thing?

11:55.467 --> 11:56.733
- It worked.

11:56.733 --> 11:58.200
- Just you know, talk
things through you know,

11:58.200 --> 11:59.467
and maybe just sort of
debrief a bit, get a donut.

11:59.467 --> 12:00.733
- I know.

12:00.733 --> 12:01.500
- It's a bit too
full on, wasn't it?

12:01.500 --> 12:02.433
(Julie laughing)

12:02.433 --> 12:04.667
- Racing is a bit full on.

12:04.667 --> 12:05.900
- You remember the
first time he said

12:05.900 --> 12:07.567
he wanted to race
in the juniors?

12:07.567 --> 12:08.700
And he got sick for

12:08.700 --> 12:10.300
- He had too many Chiko Rolls.

12:10.300 --> 12:11.867
(engine roaring)

12:11.867 --> 12:14.433
(upbeat music)

12:39.500 --> 12:40.567
(tires screeching)

12:40.567 --> 12:43.333
(engine roaring)

12:45.400 --> 12:46.733
- What are you
doing in my kitchen?

12:46.733 --> 12:50.967
- Hi, I'm making tofu balls.

12:50.967 --> 12:51.967
- Oh, sorry.

12:51.967 --> 12:53.533
I meant get out of my kitchen.

12:53.533 --> 12:56.300
- Mom, Ashley's making dinner.

12:59.433 --> 13:01.067
- You bought beer?

13:01.067 --> 13:02.767
- Got it from nan and pop's.

13:02.767 --> 13:03.600
For Ashley.

13:03.600 --> 13:04.433
- Thanks baby.

13:05.733 --> 13:06.633
- Tofu for Amber?

13:08.067 --> 13:10.333
- I'm okay. I'm gonna
stick a wad of wet tissue

13:10.333 --> 13:12.400
inside an egg carton
and eat that instead.

13:12.400 --> 13:13.967
- Whoa.

13:13.967 --> 13:14.933
- Your loss.

13:27.100 --> 13:29.400
- Guys are really
hectic right now.

13:29.400 --> 13:31.633
I'm gonna go for
a drive to chill.

13:31.633 --> 13:32.733
- I'll come with you.

13:32.733 --> 13:33.933
- Whatevs.

13:33.933 --> 13:35.267
- Shawn, you're
not going anywhere.

13:35.267 --> 13:36.800
- Oh really?

13:36.800 --> 13:38.500
That's funny because look,
here I am going somewhere.

13:38.500 --> 13:39.333
- Shawn.

13:39.333 --> 13:40.867
- Far away from you.

13:40.867 --> 13:42.500
(door banging)

13:42.500 --> 13:45.067
(somber music)

13:51.567 --> 13:54.333
(engine roaring)

13:55.567 --> 13:58.233
- You had your eyes
shut the whole time.

13:58.233 --> 14:00.333
- Not the whole time.

14:00.333 --> 14:01.867
- The GoPro does not lie mate.

14:03.067 --> 14:05.100
0.5 seconds eyes closed,

14:05.100 --> 14:06.667
one second eyes closed.

14:06.667 --> 14:09.133
1.5 seconds, eyes still closed.

14:09.133 --> 14:10.833
- We get the idea Tone

14:10.833 --> 14:12.133
Could you give us a minute?

14:16.433 --> 14:18.467
You don't have to do this
if you don't want it.

14:18.467 --> 14:20.067
- I do want it.

14:20.067 --> 14:22.533
- Why didn't you
open your eyes love?

14:22.533 --> 14:23.700
- I was visualizing,

14:23.700 --> 14:24.933
- He was visualizing,

14:24.933 --> 14:26.567
- That's what all
the top drivers do.

14:26.567 --> 14:27.800
- It's true, we do.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.500
- I saw the whole run
from inside my eyes.

14:29.500 --> 14:30.800
- Yeah, but we're paying Tone

14:30.800 --> 14:33.300
so you can see
outside your eyes.

14:33.300 --> 14:35.067
- He was very helpful dad.

14:35.067 --> 14:36.667
- Really?

14:36.667 --> 14:38.533
- I'm ready to go
on my own next time.

14:38.533 --> 14:41.100
(upbeat music)

14:45.267 --> 14:47.933
(door knocking)

14:54.267 --> 14:55.667
- I've come from my stapler.

14:57.267 --> 14:58.833
I haven't really.

14:58.833 --> 14:59.767
I don't think it
was stapled anything

14:59.767 --> 15:02.333
in about three years, actually.

15:02.333 --> 15:04.400
I've come to apologize.

15:04.400 --> 15:07.533
Apparently, abusing a parent
that comes to you for help,

15:07.533 --> 15:09.400
is not within the school
policy guidelines.

15:09.400 --> 15:13.867
I looked that up this
afternoon, so I'm sorry.

15:15.533 --> 15:16.800
- Okay.

15:16.800 --> 15:18.300
- You caught me at a bad time.

15:20.167 --> 15:23.167
You caught me at a
bad time this morning,

15:23.167 --> 15:25.433
I'm giving up smoking.

15:26.867 --> 15:27.900
- That's going well.

15:27.900 --> 15:29.900
- It's going very well.

15:29.900 --> 15:31.500
I just wanted you to know that

15:31.500 --> 15:33.533
my fish isn't always rotting.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.300
You'd said the fish
rots from the head,

15:36.300 --> 15:39.500
well sometimes I run a
very happy, healthy fish.

15:40.600 --> 15:42.300
I'm talking about
school just to be clear.

15:42.300 --> 15:44.067
- Listen, I can't
look after one kid,.

15:44.067 --> 15:46.333
I can imagine what it's
like to look after 800.

15:47.467 --> 15:48.967
- 1800.

15:48.967 --> 15:51.533
- Bullshit, no
wonder it's a mess.

15:51.533 --> 15:54.267
- So here's the thing
we need Shawn to stay.

15:55.300 --> 15:56.533
- We do?

15:56.533 --> 15:58.800
- I can't lose another
good student like Shawn.

15:58.800 --> 15:59.900
He's one of our smartest kids

15:59.900 --> 16:01.500
and we lose all the smart ones

16:01.500 --> 16:02.733
to the Catholic school, usually?

16:02.733 --> 16:05.833
Why does he wanna leave?

16:05.833 --> 16:08.200
- He wants to go to
India, he's in love.

16:09.067 --> 16:11.067
- With an Indian girl?

16:11.067 --> 16:12.233
- With a vegan.

16:12.233 --> 16:14.200
- That's intense.

16:14.200 --> 16:15.300
- Tofu bowl?

16:16.600 --> 16:18.433
- No, thank you. I just

16:18.433 --> 16:19.267
- Hate tofu?

16:20.900 --> 16:21.733
- Yes.

16:23.400 --> 16:24.633
I'm sorry, I didn't
make the connection

16:24.633 --> 16:26.833
that you were Shawn's mom.

16:26.833 --> 16:28.333
I mean, you don't
look old enough to

16:28.333 --> 16:30.567
- I was chubby for nine
months in high school.

16:30.567 --> 16:32.067
Let's put it that way.

16:32.067 --> 16:33.800
But I got through it
and I got a good job

16:33.800 --> 16:36.167
and I want that for Shawn too.

16:36.167 --> 16:38.267
- So, you're the primary carer?

16:38.267 --> 16:39.433
- Pay for everything, yeah.

16:39.433 --> 16:40.300
- What about his father?

16:40.300 --> 16:41.267
- He's a dickhead.

16:42.500 --> 16:43.867
- Think you could
bring him in to see me.

16:43.867 --> 16:45.500
- Seriously, he's a dickhead.

16:46.633 --> 16:47.833
- Talking about Shawn.

16:48.900 --> 16:49.833
Do you think you could get him

16:49.833 --> 16:51.967
to come in and have a chat?

16:51.967 --> 16:54.567
(upbeat music)

17:00.333 --> 17:01.800
- I'm on my way to
work with the girls,

17:01.800 --> 17:03.367
but I just got Fed Exed this.

17:03.367 --> 17:05.533
It's just a little
something for Oscar's trip.

17:07.500 --> 17:08.800
- Aspen, Colorado?

17:08.800 --> 17:10.733
- They have such
lovely ski wear.

17:10.733 --> 17:11.967
- You bought him something from

17:11.967 --> 17:13.967
the most expensive
resort in the world?

17:13.967 --> 17:16.767
- So make sure he
keeps the labels

17:16.767 --> 17:19.067
visible in all the photos.

17:22.200 --> 17:25.067
- Okay, now we've got the
boots in the right size.

17:25.067 --> 17:27.100
Backpack, oh feel that.

17:28.700 --> 17:30.167
- It is so light.

17:30.167 --> 17:32.067
- It's titanium, it's
won all the awards.

17:32.067 --> 17:34.333
- Oscar, you won't even
know you're wearing that.

17:34.333 --> 17:35.767
- Cool.

17:35.767 --> 17:37.500
- You do realize, Oscar's meant
to do the packing himself?

17:37.500 --> 17:38.933
It was part of the
whole experience.

17:38.933 --> 17:40.667
- Honey, it's Oscar.

17:40.667 --> 17:43.133
- Oh and got the bamboo
cooking utensils,

17:43.133 --> 17:44.800
same Japanese website.

17:44.800 --> 17:46.300
- Oh, Oh, Oh.

17:46.300 --> 17:49.600
Thermals from Denmark, made
especially for snowstorms.

17:49.600 --> 17:50.833
- He's going to Tasmania,

17:50.833 --> 17:51.967
not North of the wall.

17:51.967 --> 17:54.500
- Toilet paper in sandwich bags.

17:54.500 --> 17:56.067
- Yep, we should take the
wrapping off of those.

17:56.067 --> 17:57.800
- No, no. I don't
think that matters.

17:57.800 --> 17:58.933
- Dad just wants
everyone to know

17:58.933 --> 18:00.400
that he buys recycled
toilet paper,

18:00.400 --> 18:01.700
that gives half its
money to charity.

18:01.700 --> 18:03.133
- No.

18:03.133 --> 18:04.100
Why are you so grumpy?

18:04.100 --> 18:06.200
- I'm not grumpy, I'm disgusted.

18:06.200 --> 18:07.633
You have bought
every single item

18:07.633 --> 18:09.467
on that checklist brand new.

18:09.467 --> 18:11.800
This trip is meant to be
a lesson in entitlement.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.733
But so far, the
only lesson is that

18:13.733 --> 18:15.833
you two are enablers
of entitlement.

18:15.833 --> 18:16.933
- Come on, Little
Lord Fauntleroy,

18:16.933 --> 18:18.067
We'll miss the bus.

18:21.967 --> 18:23.467
(plastic bag crinkling)

18:23.467 --> 18:24.467
- I mean you Oscar.

18:28.900 --> 18:29.733
- Bye mom.

18:29.733 --> 18:30.567
- Bye.

18:31.467 --> 18:32.300
- Bye.

18:33.467 --> 18:34.300
- She's right.

18:34.300 --> 18:35.867
- She's 100% right.

18:35.867 --> 18:36.900
- We should send all this back.

18:36.900 --> 18:37.733
- We should.

18:38.733 --> 18:39.567
- We're not going to, are we?

18:39.567 --> 18:40.800
- No.

18:40.800 --> 18:42.567
- I mean, have you put
your hand in there?

18:42.567 --> 18:43.567
- No.

18:43.567 --> 18:44.400
- It's like

18:44.400 --> 18:45.233
- It's too hot.

18:45.233 --> 18:47.800
(upbeat music)

18:49.067 --> 18:50.567
- Thank you so
much for coming in.

18:50.567 --> 18:51.600
- I'm dropping out of school.

18:51.600 --> 18:53.067
- I totally understand.

18:53.067 --> 18:55.467
This is purely a formality
for the department.

18:55.467 --> 18:56.933
Need to ask you a few
questions in order

18:56.933 --> 18:59.400
to technically release
you from the school.

18:59.400 --> 19:01.500
So you're off to India?

19:01.500 --> 19:02.800
Where are you going first?

19:04.300 --> 19:05.567
- Don't know.

19:05.567 --> 19:07.233
- Oh, sure. Work it
out as you go along?

19:08.567 --> 19:10.800
- Okay, why India?

19:10.800 --> 19:12.567
- My girlfriend
really wants to go.

19:13.467 --> 19:16.500
- Say no more, the girlfriend.

19:16.500 --> 19:20.067
- But I really want to,
you know, India is cool.

19:24.300 --> 19:25.667
- So mom's always worked?

19:26.833 --> 19:27.667
- Yes.

19:28.500 --> 19:29.333
- And dad?

19:31.767 --> 19:34.967
- Dad's been more of a
one-off project based.

19:36.367 --> 19:38.667
- I need him to answer these
questions uninterrupted.

19:40.300 --> 19:42.633
- Dad's never really had a job.

19:42.633 --> 19:46.067
- Okay. So, Mum's always
put food on the table,

19:46.067 --> 19:47.267
bought your clothes?

19:47.267 --> 19:48.533
- What's this got to
do with me leaving?

19:48.533 --> 19:50.967
- Bureaucracy, statistics.

19:50.967 --> 19:52.400
How does mom feel about work?

19:52.400 --> 19:53.200
- She hates it.

19:53.200 --> 19:54.400
- Oh bloody love my job.

19:54.400 --> 19:56.100
- She never stops complaining.

19:56.100 --> 19:57.333
- Only because I have to.

19:57.333 --> 19:59.800
- Amber, you can wait
outside if you'd prefer.

20:02.733 --> 20:04.467
Reason for leaving?

20:04.467 --> 20:05.733
- Travel.

20:05.733 --> 20:06.867
- Oh, there's no
travel column here.

20:06.867 --> 20:08.200
There is apprenticeship,
drugs, failing.

20:08.200 --> 20:09.900
- So, what did you put?

20:09.900 --> 20:11.100
- Parental issues.

20:11.100 --> 20:12.200
- What?

20:12.200 --> 20:13.800
- Mum wants me to stay.

20:13.800 --> 20:15.533
I'm leaving because
I want to travel.

20:15.533 --> 20:16.800
- And because you're scared.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.600
- Scared? What?

20:18.600 --> 20:21.267
I'm the opposite of scared,
I'm going exploring.

20:22.200 --> 20:23.700
Make up a new column for travel.

20:23.700 --> 20:25.933
- Ooh, they get really mad
if you squiggle extra lines.

20:25.933 --> 20:27.433
- What am I scared of?

20:27.433 --> 20:29.733
- Finishing school, being
like your mother and father.

20:29.733 --> 20:30.967
- I beg your pardon?

20:30.967 --> 20:32.600
- One's never worked,
the others always worked

20:32.600 --> 20:34.233
but is always unhappy.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.200
(Amber sighs)

20:35.200 --> 20:36.400
- Shawn, come wait in the car.

20:36.400 --> 20:37.233
- No, please stay.

20:37.233 --> 20:38.033
- I said go.

20:42.433 --> 20:43.467
- We were just
getting somewhere.

20:43.467 --> 20:44.833
- By piling shit on me?

20:44.833 --> 20:46.100
- No.

20:46.100 --> 20:47.333
- So he's running
away, because of me?

20:47.333 --> 20:48.300
- He's chosen a
girl with no rules,

20:48.300 --> 20:49.133
no responsibility, no meat.

20:49.133 --> 20:50.367
- No fucking deodorant.

20:50.367 --> 20:51.767
- So let's say yes,
his running away

20:51.767 --> 20:53.267
has something to do with you.

20:53.267 --> 20:55.400
- What makes you
think I'm unhappy?

20:56.867 --> 20:58.367
- You've been a mother,
since you were at school.

20:58.367 --> 21:01.367
you work your ass off.
You are exhausted, lonely,

21:01.367 --> 21:03.667
and to top it all off, the
boy you're doing it all for

21:03.667 --> 21:04.733
he's leaving you.

21:13.067 --> 21:16.333
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to make you

21:19.067 --> 21:22.267
I just thought you had
every reason to be unhappy.

21:36.833 --> 21:40.200
Pretty sure that was more
unprofessional than smoking.

21:40.200 --> 21:42.267
- I better go after him.

21:42.267 --> 21:44.433
- Yes, yes you should.

21:45.667 --> 21:48.367
(heels clacking)

21:51.633 --> 21:53.967
- Sorry, nothing happened.

21:53.967 --> 21:56.700
We were just discussing, Shawn.

21:58.900 --> 22:01.200
Listen that stuff he was saying,

22:01.200 --> 22:03.733
your dad and I haven't
always been perfect.

22:03.733 --> 22:04.967
And I know I'm a
pain in the ass.

22:04.967 --> 22:06.700
- Ashley doesn't
wanna go to India.

22:06.700 --> 22:07.633
(Amber sighs)

22:07.633 --> 22:08.933
- Where does she wanna go?

22:08.933 --> 22:10.900
- She broke up with me.

22:10.900 --> 22:12.400
She said I'm too full on.

22:13.500 --> 22:14.600
- Too full on?

22:15.467 --> 22:16.400
Where is she?

22:16.400 --> 22:17.200
I'll show her fucking full on.

22:17.200 --> 22:18.133
(engine starting)

22:18.133 --> 22:19.933
- Mom stop, just for once.

22:19.933 --> 22:20.767
Stop.

22:24.600 --> 22:27.167
(gentle music)

22:28.867 --> 22:30.800
- Okay. This doesn't
have to be fast.

22:30.800 --> 22:34.633
I just want you to
concentrate on the moments.

22:34.633 --> 22:36.100
- When did Brianna
and Younis get here?

22:36.100 --> 22:38.367
- Oh, I asked them to
come down to cheer you on.

22:39.400 --> 22:42.400
(shoes unstrapping)

22:50.467 --> 22:52.167
Is everything all
right down there?

22:52.167 --> 22:53.100
- Yes.

22:54.267 --> 22:56.933
(shoes unstrapping)

22:56.933 --> 22:57.867
- Hi driver.

22:57.867 --> 22:59.433
- Hi.

22:59.433 --> 23:01.733
- We brought the rest
of the turducken, bro.

23:01.733 --> 23:02.567
Bit of protein?

23:04.600 --> 23:05.433
- Kayne.

23:06.967 --> 23:07.967
What's wrong?

23:07.967 --> 23:08.800
Kayne, what's wrong?

23:08.800 --> 23:10.067
- It's the turducken.

23:10.067 --> 23:11.067
I told you to put
more ice bricks in.

23:11.067 --> 23:12.233
- You'll be right, mate.

23:12.233 --> 23:13.800
It's probably just
a bit of heatstroke.

23:13.800 --> 23:15.200
- Heat stroke?

23:15.200 --> 23:17.067
- Yeah, Kayne gets a bit
heatstroke every now and again.

23:17.067 --> 23:18.067
- Can you sit up love?

23:18.067 --> 23:19.267
- Come on Kayne,
push through it.

23:19.267 --> 23:21.900
- Give him a sec, he's hot.

23:21.900 --> 23:23.800
- Well it's not that hot.

23:23.800 --> 23:26.500
- Maybe for you it's not,
but Kayne feels the heat.

23:26.500 --> 23:27.467
That's the thing
with heatstroke,

23:27.467 --> 23:29.633
it can get you at any time.

23:29.633 --> 23:31.300
You don't expect it,

23:31.300 --> 23:32.533
but you've got to talk
in front of people,

23:32.533 --> 23:34.667
you've got a meeting
with a big sponsor

23:34.667 --> 23:35.933
or you've gotta to have one
of those tests at the hospital

23:35.933 --> 23:37.100
where they slide you
in the white tunnel.

23:37.100 --> 23:39.067
So no offense
Tone, but piss off.

23:40.067 --> 23:41.500
- No worries.

23:41.500 --> 23:42.433
- Throw that out.

23:42.433 --> 23:43.800
- It was chilled.

23:43.800 --> 23:45.067
- Bin it, now.

23:45.067 --> 23:46.500
- Deep breaths love,
that's the way.

23:46.500 --> 23:47.333
Brianna.

23:49.933 --> 23:52.467
This is a panic
attack, isn't it?

23:52.467 --> 23:53.400
- A what?

23:53.400 --> 23:54.700
- You have panic attacks.

23:54.700 --> 23:55.967
- No, I have heatstroke.

23:55.967 --> 23:57.933
- Why haven't I ever
heard about this?

23:59.300 --> 24:00.800
- It's embarrassing
to talk about.

24:00.800 --> 24:03.133
- And pooping your pants
during an MRI isn't?

24:03.133 --> 24:04.400
- I wasn't wearing any pants.

24:04.400 --> 24:06.233
- You told me you
ate a dodgy kebab.

24:07.800 --> 24:11.567
The Chiko rolls when Kayne
got sick at the juniors.

24:11.567 --> 24:13.867
- I was never sure it
was the Chiko roll.

24:13.867 --> 24:15.367
So I tried to tell you that.

24:15.367 --> 24:18.100
- 15 years later, how can
I help you if I don't know?

24:18.100 --> 24:20.467
- You can help by not
pushing him to race.

24:22.233 --> 24:23.300
- I didn't mean that.

24:27.833 --> 24:28.767
(Julie sighs)

24:28.767 --> 24:30.667
- You're right, he's not ready.

24:30.667 --> 24:31.500
- Yet.

24:32.700 --> 24:35.100
Just have to get him
ready in Kayne time.

24:35.100 --> 24:37.667
(upbeat music)

24:43.900 --> 24:46.133
- Arms outstretched,
feel the car.

24:47.067 --> 24:50.067
0.8 seconds, 160km/hr

24:50.067 --> 24:52.167
And go, go, go, go.

24:52.167 --> 24:54.533
(upbeat music)

24:54.533 --> 24:57.600
- That's it, Kayne, go baby.

24:57.600 --> 24:58.700
- Killing it.

25:00.233 --> 25:01.467
I think we should ask Tony

25:01.467 --> 25:02.500
to drive for us
in the Winternats.

25:02.500 --> 25:03.967
- Already have.

25:03.967 --> 25:05.400
- Anything for you, babe.

25:07.933 --> 25:08.933
And you, Wayno.

25:08.933 --> 25:11.600
(upbeat music)

25:26.900 --> 25:29.933
- Feel a bit guilty about
buying all that stuff for Oscar.

25:29.933 --> 25:31.500
- And packing for him.

25:31.500 --> 25:33.500
- Well, he's on his own now.

25:33.500 --> 25:34.633
- Yeah exactly.

25:34.633 --> 25:36.400
I mean, they
wouldn't even let me

25:36.400 --> 25:37.667
put his backpack on the bus.

25:37.667 --> 25:40.067
- He'll have to manage
everything by himself.

25:40.067 --> 25:40.833
(engine starting)

25:40.833 --> 25:41.700
- Exactly.

25:41.700 --> 25:44.300
(upbeat music)

25:50.800 --> 25:53.633
(phone vibrating)

25:54.733 --> 25:56.400
- So you're talking to me again?

25:56.400 --> 25:57.600
- I wanted to say sorry

25:57.600 --> 25:59.233
that you broke up
with your girlfriend.

25:59.233 --> 26:00.133
- No you're not.

26:00.133 --> 26:01.067
- No I'm not.

26:01.067 --> 26:02.067
I think she was really selfish

26:02.067 --> 26:03.233
to want you to go to India.

26:03.233 --> 26:04.833
- Well, I'm not now.

26:04.833 --> 26:05.667
- I'm glad.

26:05.667 --> 26:07.133
(door knocks)

26:07.133 --> 26:09.067
- I'm going to South America.

26:09.067 --> 26:11.133
- Shawn, that is the
stupidest thing I've heard.

26:11.133 --> 26:12.200
- In two years.

26:13.833 --> 26:15.267
Sucker, I'll call you back.

26:20.600 --> 26:21.400
Mr. Janko.

26:21.400 --> 26:22.333
- Hi Shawn.

26:22.333 --> 26:23.533
- I'm coming back to school.

26:23.533 --> 26:24.767
- Oh, I know.

26:24.767 --> 26:26.433
Actually, I'm not
here to see you,

26:26.433 --> 26:29.400
I'm here to see her.

26:30.833 --> 26:31.667
- What?

26:34.533 --> 26:35.767
What?

26:35.767 --> 26:37.500
- You're dinner
is in the fridge.

26:37.500 --> 26:40.233
(heels clacking)

26:44.267 --> 26:47.300
- My life is over,
you know that, right?

26:47.300 --> 26:48.733
- I got that.

26:48.733 --> 26:51.300
- Okay. Okay, I'm dropping
out of school again.

26:51.300 --> 26:53.900
(upbeat music)
