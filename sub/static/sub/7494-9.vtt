WEBVTT

00:00.968 --> 00:01.702
Last time on
Make it Pop.

00:01.735 --> 00:02.403
You're masked girl?

00:02.436 --> 00:04.672
And you lied to
me about it?

00:04.705 --> 00:07.475
Kiss the crown goodbye, because
Corki is going all the way.

00:07.508 --> 00:08.709
This isn't over.

00:08.742 --> 00:11.279
I'm going to the dance this
Friday and I'm going with you.

00:11.312 --> 00:12.480
I can't be your date.

00:12.513 --> 00:13.447
I'm DJ-ing it.

00:13.481 --> 00:15.015
(explosion)

00:16.184 --> 00:18.719
(coughing)

00:22.856 --> 00:24.092
Keep it moving people.

00:24.125 --> 00:29.563
Nothing to see here.

00:29.597 --> 00:30.398
Step aside,

00:30.431 --> 00:34.202
Step aside!

00:34.235 --> 00:36.337
What's going
on here?

00:36.370 --> 00:41.075
Oh, it's nothin, just a
little electrical explosion.

00:41.109 --> 00:44.112
Nothing a little elbow
grease can't clean up.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.816
(bell ringing)

00:48.849 --> 00:51.285
I've been working on my solo
performance for Homecoming.

00:51.319 --> 00:54.422
When Mr. Stark sees it,
he'll cast me as Dorothy.

00:54.455 --> 00:56.724
I can show you the
moves if you want.

00:56.757 --> 00:58.259
Here?

00:58.292 --> 01:00.594
Is there ever a bad
time for my moves?

01:00.628 --> 01:03.731
Ah 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 7, 8.

01:03.764 --> 01:05.599
Wow.

01:05.633 --> 01:06.634
Corkie: Hey, wait up!

01:06.667 --> 01:08.502
Hey, ready for
our aptitude test?

01:08.536 --> 01:10.404
I'm so excited.

01:10.438 --> 01:10.738
Attitude test!

01:10.771 --> 01:11.672
Hey you!

01:11.705 --> 01:12.606
I'm a diva!!!

01:12.640 --> 01:14.208
Deal with it.

01:14.242 --> 01:15.609
That's an A+
right there.

01:15.643 --> 01:18.179
Aptitude, Sun Hi,
not attitude.

01:18.212 --> 01:19.847
Huh?

01:19.880 --> 01:20.848
Oh.

01:20.881 --> 01:23.384
But I didn't study!

01:23.417 --> 01:25.186
You can't study for
an aptitude test.

01:25.219 --> 01:27.188
It assesses what kind
of person you are

01:27.221 --> 01:29.423
so you can have
direction in life.

01:29.457 --> 01:31.325
Oh I get it.

01:31.359 --> 01:36.664
So, like: "Are you
a) Fabulous b) Fabulous

01:36.697 --> 01:41.835
c) Fabulous
d) All of the above?"

01:41.869 --> 01:44.372
I'll do just fine.

01:44.405 --> 01:45.773
This place is
a mess.

01:45.806 --> 01:48.242
It's a bigger disaster
than my last hair cut.

01:48.276 --> 01:52.246
Let's just say, not everyone
can pull off bangs.

01:52.280 --> 01:52.780
I dunno.

01:52.813 --> 01:54.415
I've seen worse.

01:54.448 --> 01:57.785
I'm going to assume you had
something to do with this?

01:57.818 --> 01:58.886
Well you know...

01:58.919 --> 02:00.754
Assumptions
can be silly,

02:00.788 --> 02:03.291
Yet, oddly accurate.

02:03.324 --> 02:04.292
I'm sorry.

02:04.325 --> 02:07.628
Why did I ever agree to
let you DJ the dance?

02:07.661 --> 02:08.829
Come on.

02:08.862 --> 02:11.699
All this needs is a couple
boards, a few nails and ta-da!

02:11.732 --> 02:12.466
Good as new.

02:12.500 --> 02:14.368
You'd better
hope that's true.

02:14.402 --> 02:17.638
If this isn't fixed in time for
Homecoming, heads will roll.

02:17.671 --> 02:19.173
Starting with
yours, Mr. Davis.

02:19.207 --> 02:23.844
And followed closely
by yours, Mr. Stark.

02:23.877 --> 02:26.180
I love my head.

02:26.214 --> 02:28.216
And I am pretty sure
it's not replaceable.

02:28.249 --> 02:32.453
Imagine how I feel after
mine has aged so gracefully.

02:32.486 --> 02:35.189
Mr. Stark: Ah Ms. Diona.

02:37.591 --> 02:39.159
Who knew that an
aptitude test

02:39.193 --> 02:40.728
would be worse than
a regular test?

02:40.761 --> 02:42.129
Seriously.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.631
It was like a
test designed

02:43.664 --> 02:45.766
to tell us we're bad
at taking tests.

02:45.799 --> 02:46.300
Wow!!!

02:46.334 --> 02:47.201
Are you kidding me?

02:47.235 --> 02:50.204
I've never seen a
dress so beautiful!

02:50.238 --> 02:52.240
That kind of reaction
never gets old.

02:52.273 --> 02:55.476
I was hoping Jared would've
asked me to the dance by now,

02:55.509 --> 02:56.844
but nothing.

02:56.877 --> 02:59.647
Don't worry, he will, and
then he won't be able to

02:59.680 --> 03:02.916
take his eyes off you
in this little number.

03:02.950 --> 03:05.619
Why does anyone care
about being noticed by boys?

03:05.653 --> 03:08.656
You do realize that most them
just have one pair of pants

03:08.689 --> 03:11.158
that they wear over
and over, right?

03:11.191 --> 03:13.727
It's disgusting.

03:13.761 --> 03:16.730
Which one of you
is Sun Hi Song?

03:16.764 --> 03:17.431
Later, girls.

03:17.465 --> 03:19.333
My public calls.

03:19.367 --> 03:21.635
I assume you want to
interview me for something?

03:21.669 --> 03:23.170
Who are you with?

03:23.203 --> 03:24.538
A TV show?

03:24.572 --> 03:25.406
Website?

03:25.439 --> 03:26.407
Magazine?

03:26.440 --> 03:27.308
All three?

03:27.341 --> 03:29.577
No, this is about
your aptitude test.

03:29.610 --> 03:31.679
We need to talk.

03:31.712 --> 03:32.746
Actually, that's
Sun Hi.

03:32.780 --> 03:33.681
My name's Jodi.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.949
I love dancing
and fashion.

03:35.983 --> 03:38.486
* Make it pop, woo, woo

03:38.519 --> 03:43.657
* Make it pop, Woo
Woo, I can't wait no *

03:43.691 --> 03:48.562
* I can't wait no, I can't
wait, no I can't wait *

03:48.596 --> 03:51.899
* So make it pop, we're
bout to, we're bout to blow *

03:51.932 --> 03:53.567
* Wait till we drop

03:53.601 --> 03:55.569
* Oh ya, we're
ready to go *

03:55.603 --> 03:58.906
* Ain't gonna stop, when
is it time for the show *

03:58.939 --> 04:01.809
* We make it, you make
it, they make it *

04:01.842 --> 04:04.845
* M-m-m-m-m-m-
Make it pop *

04:07.348 --> 04:08.482
*

04:13.754 --> 04:14.722
(sigh)

04:14.755 --> 04:18.659
Seriously, what could
they be talking about?

04:18.692 --> 04:24.398
Whooo, maybe this is one of
those hidden camera shows...

04:24.432 --> 04:27.801
When they show this on TV, I'll
pretend to be all embarrassed.

04:27.835 --> 04:31.339
Hey, whoever's filming this,
that thing I just said?

04:31.372 --> 04:33.341
Don't use in the clip!

04:33.374 --> 04:36.510
Just kidding, you should
totally use all of this.

04:36.544 --> 04:39.212
Everything I do is gold.

04:40.781 --> 04:41.682
Corki's right.

04:41.715 --> 04:45.786
This is my masterpiece.

04:45.819 --> 04:48.689
This should be hanging in
a gallery, not a closet.

04:48.722 --> 04:49.757
Is it done?

04:49.790 --> 04:52.660
Can I try it on now?

04:52.693 --> 04:55.262
It's really amazing, Jodi.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.865
How do I ever repay you for
being such a wonderful,

04:57.898 --> 04:58.866
generous friend?

04:58.899 --> 05:00.233
Cash is fine.

05:00.267 --> 05:00.934
Kidding.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.670
I'm just happy
you like it.

05:02.703 --> 05:04.738
Can I try on my
Homecoming dress now?

05:04.772 --> 05:05.373
Dress?

05:05.406 --> 05:07.508
What dress?

05:07.541 --> 05:09.276
Can I please have it?

05:09.309 --> 05:10.511
Of course.

05:10.544 --> 05:12.480
Take it.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.624
What's with all the
secret talk, huh?

05:23.657 --> 05:24.858
Did I fail the test?

05:24.892 --> 05:25.859
I failed, right?

05:25.893 --> 05:28.362
Or did it reveal something
horrible about me?

05:28.396 --> 05:30.263
Like I'm a narcissist
or something?

05:30.297 --> 05:33.266
No, that can't be
it -- I'm flawless.

05:33.300 --> 05:34.435
C'mon!

05:34.468 --> 05:35.335
Just tell me!

05:35.369 --> 05:36.537
Why am I here?!

05:36.570 --> 05:38.772
Why do you think
you're here, Sun Hi?

05:38.806 --> 05:43.644
I think I'm here to receive an
award for general awesomeness,

05:43.677 --> 05:46.279
but that is why I always
think I am anywhere,

05:46.313 --> 05:47.815
so it really
doesn't help.

05:47.848 --> 05:52.853
Surprisingly, the test revealed
something we never expected.

05:52.886 --> 05:53.921
Sun Hi...

05:53.954 --> 05:55.489
You are a genius.

05:55.523 --> 05:56.323
Not my fault.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.324
The scores are wrong.

05:57.357 --> 06:00.994
I want a re-count...

06:01.028 --> 06:01.962
Say what now?

06:01.995 --> 06:05.065
I said, you're a genius.

06:05.098 --> 06:06.667
You mean like
an evil genius?

06:06.700 --> 06:08.669
My parents tell me
that all the time.

06:08.702 --> 06:11.705
Your musical and intra personal
intelligence are off the charts.

06:11.739 --> 06:13.707
Discovering someone
as special as you

06:13.741 --> 06:17.545
is what makes me
love my job.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.713
Sun Hi Song.

06:19.747 --> 06:22.683
Genius.

06:22.716 --> 06:23.551
Ha.

06:23.584 --> 06:24.985
Ha.

06:25.018 --> 06:27.387
Okay so, we'll
just um...

06:27.421 --> 06:31.892
(laughing
hysterically)

06:31.925 --> 06:33.927
I knew I was gifted.

06:33.961 --> 06:35.028
Whoa!

06:39.700 --> 06:40.968
Where is my dress?

06:41.001 --> 06:41.669
What dress?

06:41.702 --> 06:43.370
The dress you
made for me.

06:43.403 --> 06:44.705
You lost the dress?

06:44.738 --> 06:46.507
No, I left it
right there.

06:46.540 --> 06:50.377
You finished it, gave it to me,
had a hard time handing it over,

06:50.410 --> 06:51.979
And then it was gone.

06:52.012 --> 06:53.380
Someone either
took it or...

06:53.413 --> 06:54.915
kept it for themselves?

06:54.948 --> 06:56.950
Excuse me?

06:56.984 --> 06:58.018
It's just...

06:58.051 --> 07:00.353
you literally wouldn't
hand it over this morning.

07:00.387 --> 07:02.355
Are you sure you didn't
change your mind

07:02.389 --> 07:03.624
and decide to
keep it?

07:03.657 --> 07:04.692
That's crazy...

07:04.725 --> 07:05.693
Sun Hi: Make way!

07:05.726 --> 07:10.764
Super Genius
in the house!

07:10.798 --> 07:13.634
You laughed when I tried
to invent electric pants,

07:13.667 --> 07:17.705
but look who is now a
certified genius, Ding!

07:17.738 --> 07:21.008
I'm totally confused.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.075
It's true.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.877
Sun Hi is a genius.

07:23.911 --> 07:26.880
Now we have two giant
mysteries on our hands.

07:26.914 --> 07:30.117
Well, luckily I'm here
to help solve them!

07:30.150 --> 07:32.620
That's probably something
that geniuses do, right?

07:32.653 --> 07:34.054
Come to think of it...

07:34.087 --> 07:37.525
I don't know what
a genius does...

07:37.558 --> 07:43.564
* Bam bop bop bale Bop bop

genius at being a genius.

09:42.115 --> 09:42.950
Hello.

09:42.983 --> 09:45.018
How's my newly
discovered genius doing?

09:45.052 --> 09:46.119
Good!

09:46.153 --> 09:49.623
I mean, marvelous.

09:49.657 --> 09:51.591
That's a "genius"
word for good.

09:51.625 --> 09:54.161
We have a plan
for you, Sun Hi.

09:54.194 --> 09:56.630
I believe it will
make you very happy.

09:56.664 --> 09:59.432
You're not putting me on
some of genius island, are you?

09:59.466 --> 10:00.634
Not exactly.

10:00.668 --> 10:01.869
You'll be
transferred to the

10:01.902 --> 10:05.673
Fobblesmith School for
Advanced Studies.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.440
A new school?

10:07.474 --> 10:08.575
Similar to
MacKendrick,

10:08.608 --> 10:11.679
but made up entirely of gifted
students like yourself.

10:11.712 --> 10:14.848
People teetering on the verge
of international super stardom?

10:14.882 --> 10:15.949
Courses are college level.

10:15.983 --> 10:16.750
No distractions.

10:16.784 --> 10:18.085
No interruptions.

10:18.118 --> 10:21.021
All learning, all the time.

10:21.054 --> 10:26.994
Is that even possible --
to learn all the time?

10:27.027 --> 10:29.596
I mean, what about those
couple of hours after lunch

10:29.629 --> 10:30.998
when my brain
usually shuts down?

10:31.031 --> 10:32.666
That's called
English Class.

10:32.700 --> 10:36.069
Don't worry, they operate on
the honor system there,

10:36.103 --> 10:37.705
no tests or grades.

10:37.738 --> 10:39.106
No tests?

10:39.139 --> 10:40.207
I'm in.

10:40.240 --> 10:43.243
The alumni include a couple
of Nobel Prize winners.

10:43.276 --> 10:44.144
I love awards!

10:44.177 --> 10:47.614
Then polish up your
acceptance speech.

10:47.647 --> 10:48.548
No need!

10:48.581 --> 10:50.884
I've had it memorized
since I was three.

10:50.918 --> 10:53.586
So she's really
leaving?

10:56.189 --> 10:57.324
*

10:57.357 --> 10:59.592
I wonder what accessories
I'll need for genius school.

10:59.626 --> 11:02.495
Maybe like a
calculator shirt.

11:02.529 --> 11:05.498
Jodi can you get to work
on one of those for me?

11:05.532 --> 11:07.935
I can't believe you're
leaving, Sun Hi.

11:07.968 --> 11:08.836
Ow.

11:08.869 --> 11:09.236
Ow.

11:09.269 --> 11:13.673
Ow....

11:13.707 --> 11:15.976
And I can't believe
she's a genius.

11:16.009 --> 11:19.512
Yeah, I guess I'm
truly a quintuple threat.

11:19.546 --> 11:23.751
Singer, dancer,
actor and genius.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.252
That'd be a
quadruple threat.

11:25.285 --> 11:29.790
I like to throw one in for free
- that's how geniuses roll.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.624
Are you sure
you want to go?

11:31.658 --> 11:33.727
Yeah, I guess.

11:33.761 --> 11:35.062
It's like Ms.
Rhodes said,

11:35.095 --> 11:37.630
it'll be good to be around
other people like me.

11:37.664 --> 11:39.199
But, we're like you.

11:39.232 --> 11:39.933
You're our friend.

11:39.967 --> 11:42.870
And we're in a
band together.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.237
I've got it,
Sun Hi!

11:44.271 --> 11:46.206
The perfect
Homecoming solo!

11:46.239 --> 11:47.808
Oh right.

11:47.841 --> 11:49.576
I'm gonna miss
Homecoming.

11:49.609 --> 11:51.178
You're kidding right?

11:51.211 --> 11:52.112
No, Caleb.

11:52.145 --> 11:54.714
I'm way too smart to
make jokes anymore.

11:54.748 --> 11:56.984
She's switching to a
school for geniuses.

11:57.017 --> 11:58.551
Evil geniuses?

11:58.585 --> 11:59.619
That's what I said!

11:59.652 --> 12:01.188
But what about
the band?

12:01.221 --> 12:05.158
We haven't even begun to
tap into our potential yet.

12:05.192 --> 12:07.928
I have grown pretty attached
to MacKendrick Prep.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.997
I've got a long,
fabulous history here.

12:10.030 --> 12:11.999
You've only been here
a couple of weeks.

12:12.032 --> 12:14.567
That's practically
a record for me.

12:14.601 --> 12:16.837
Good point.

12:16.870 --> 12:21.041
I'll miss so much -- my solo
Homecoming performance,

12:21.074 --> 12:25.145
my chance to become an
international superstar...

12:25.178 --> 12:25.979
Ahem...

12:26.013 --> 12:27.147
And my friends!

12:27.180 --> 12:28.949
I'll miss my friends.

12:28.982 --> 12:31.051
I probably should've
said that first.

12:33.586 --> 12:34.687
Caleb: Hey, Mr. Stark.

12:34.721 --> 12:36.723
What are you doing
here, Mr. Davis?

12:36.756 --> 12:40.093
Just testing my DJ
equipment for Homecoming.

12:40.127 --> 12:42.129
Sadly, Sun Hi's
performance is a no go,

12:42.162 --> 12:46.333
but rest assured my DJ
skills will blow you away.

12:46.366 --> 12:49.569
Poor choice of words --
you're gonna love it.

12:49.602 --> 12:52.639
Listen, don't
bother setting up.

12:52.672 --> 12:55.008
No, it's fine, let
them keep working.

12:55.042 --> 12:56.343
I don't think
you understand.

12:56.376 --> 12:59.779
I can't afford to
take another chance.

12:59.813 --> 13:03.750
I'm sorry, Mr. Davis,
but you're out as DJ.

13:05.085 --> 13:07.888
Oh and if I hear of any
opportunities for an affordable

13:07.921 --> 13:12.159
demolition man I'll
give you a dingle.

13:16.864 --> 13:19.066
*

13:19.099 --> 13:20.667
How could you
have lost it?

13:20.700 --> 13:23.236
It's a dress,
not a bus pass.

13:23.270 --> 13:24.237
I didn't lose it.

13:24.271 --> 13:25.038
It just disappeared.

13:25.072 --> 13:26.006
Guys!

13:26.039 --> 13:27.640
Ms. Rhodes is coming
to get me any minute.

13:27.674 --> 13:28.842
What am I gonna do?

13:28.876 --> 13:29.943
I don't want to go.

13:29.977 --> 13:32.245
Then convince her you
don't belong at her school.

13:32.279 --> 13:33.080
How?

13:33.113 --> 13:34.247
By acting like
you're not a genius.

13:34.281 --> 13:36.783
I'm great at that!

13:36.816 --> 13:37.817
We know you are.

13:37.851 --> 13:38.818
(Knock on the door)

13:38.852 --> 13:39.619
Ms. Rhodes: Hello?

13:39.652 --> 13:41.588
She's here!

13:41.621 --> 13:42.589
(knocking)

13:42.622 --> 13:44.757
Hi, it's Sun Hi.

13:44.791 --> 13:46.093
Can I come in?

13:46.126 --> 13:48.128
It's Ms. Rhodes.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.663
(knocking)

13:50.697 --> 13:53.300
Hi Ms. Rhodes,
can you open up?

13:53.333 --> 13:55.869
Thank you...

13:55.903 --> 13:58.171
What a lovely
hallway.

13:58.205 --> 13:59.806
Um, are you
ready to go?

13:59.839 --> 14:00.507
Sure.

14:00.540 --> 14:05.078
Just let me get
my suitcase.

14:05.112 --> 14:07.915
Oops!

14:07.948 --> 14:09.782
I forgot to
pull on the...

14:09.816 --> 14:12.285
thingie that keeps the
suitcase, not open.

14:12.319 --> 14:13.753
The zipper?

14:13.786 --> 14:14.787
That's a funny name.

14:14.821 --> 14:16.656
"Zipper."

14:16.689 --> 14:21.394
They should call it Mr. Holdy
togethery-boing-boing-fun.

14:21.428 --> 14:24.031
It's less
complication-ed.

14:24.064 --> 14:28.135
I think you mean
"complicated."

14:28.168 --> 14:30.770
Did she recently receive
a blow to the head?

14:30.803 --> 14:32.272
No, she was
always like this.

14:32.305 --> 14:35.208
Except sometimes
she isn't this smart.

14:35.242 --> 14:37.044
I see what's
going on here.

14:37.077 --> 14:39.312
The apprehension, the
resistance to change,

14:39.346 --> 14:41.248
Apprehension?

14:41.281 --> 14:44.117
That's a big word.

14:44.151 --> 14:48.755
Will I learn that
at genius school?

14:48.788 --> 14:50.323
Sun Hi,
please, stop.

14:50.357 --> 14:52.192
You're not
fooling anyone.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.160
Fine!

14:53.193 --> 14:54.127
I'm a genius.

14:54.161 --> 14:55.328
I know what
zippers are!

14:55.362 --> 14:57.264
Then what's
the problem?

14:57.297 --> 15:02.335
The problem is, I
love my life here.

15:02.369 --> 15:05.238
My friends,
my music.

15:05.272 --> 15:10.043
I finally found a place
that I can be happy.

15:12.045 --> 15:12.980
Okay.

15:13.013 --> 15:14.747
Look, I'm sorry, but you
just can't make me--

15:14.781 --> 15:16.149
Wait, did you say okay?

15:16.183 --> 15:17.317
I am disappointed.

15:17.350 --> 15:20.120
You would have thrived at
Fobblesmith, I'm sure of it.

15:20.153 --> 15:22.722
But we'd never force
you to go there.

15:22.755 --> 15:23.790
You wouldn't?

15:23.823 --> 15:26.759
I trust you'll find what's
best for you, after all,

15:26.793 --> 15:29.329
you are a very
smart girl.

15:29.362 --> 15:31.231
I don't usually hear
those words without,

15:31.264 --> 15:35.202
"But you don't apply
yourself" after them.

15:35.235 --> 15:36.803
Thanks.

15:36.836 --> 15:39.106
Good luck, Sun Hi.

15:44.177 --> 15:45.212
I'm texting Caleb
the news!

15:45.245 --> 15:47.947
Okay, but make sure he
still knows I'm a genius.

15:47.981 --> 15:50.383
It gives me an edge
when he disagrees with me.

15:54.787 --> 15:55.755
I'm glad you're staying.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.258
It'll be good to have
a friend I can trust.

15:58.291 --> 15:58.825
Ughhhhh!

15:58.858 --> 16:00.027
You are so frustrating!

16:00.060 --> 16:01.794
I didn't take
the dress!

16:01.828 --> 16:03.063
Guys.

16:03.096 --> 16:05.698
I don't want to make this all
about me staying at MacKendrick,

16:05.732 --> 16:07.700
but could you please
make this all about

16:07.734 --> 16:09.969
me staying at
MacKendrick?

16:10.003 --> 16:10.737
C'mon.

16:10.770 --> 16:11.738
Let's rehearse.

16:11.771 --> 16:12.105
Yep.

16:12.139 --> 16:12.539
All set.

16:12.572 --> 16:14.541
Let's do this!

16:14.574 --> 16:22.415
*

16:22.449 --> 16:24.217
* Even though
we're tight *

16:24.251 --> 16:28.088
* Don't see eye to eye I
don't wanna fight *

16:28.121 --> 16:30.157
* Can't we let it slide

16:30.190 --> 16:32.125
* Round and round
in circles *

16:32.159 --> 16:34.094
* It all ends the same

16:34.127 --> 16:35.795
* But it's always
worth it *

16:35.828 --> 16:38.098
* Friends will never change

16:38.131 --> 16:41.601
* We'll end up right
where we began *

16:41.634 --> 16:45.705
* Bring it from the start,
time to take a stand *

16:45.738 --> 16:49.642
* We're still gonna be
the best of friends *

16:49.676 --> 16:51.378
* Wake up, make up

16:51.411 --> 16:53.546
* That's the
way we blend *

16:53.580 --> 16:55.182
* My girls!

16:55.215 --> 16:57.317
* We're all on
the same team *

16:57.350 --> 16:58.785
* My girls!

16:58.818 --> 17:01.254
* We're not
here to play *

17:01.288 --> 17:02.755
* My girls!

17:02.789 --> 17:05.158
* Living for the
same dream *

17:05.192 --> 17:06.393
* My girls!

17:06.426 --> 17:09.062
* Every day ay ay ay

17:09.096 --> 17:10.663
* My girls

17:10.697 --> 17:12.732
* Nah nah nah
nah nah nah *

17:12.765 --> 17:14.534
*My girls

17:14.567 --> 17:16.669
* Nah nah nah
nah nah *

17:16.703 --> 17:18.471
* We're one and the same

17:18.505 --> 17:20.273
* Separate in style

17:20.307 --> 17:22.109
* But I see your game

17:22.142 --> 17:24.111
* I know you that is why

17:24.144 --> 17:25.845
* When you give it good

17:25.878 --> 17:27.814
* I can give it back

17:27.847 --> 17:29.649
* You get on my nerves

17:29.682 --> 17:32.185
* But we're still on
the same track *

17:32.219 --> 17:35.755
* We'll end up right
where we began *

17:35.788 --> 17:39.859
* Bring it from the start,
time to take a stand *

17:39.892 --> 17:43.696
* We're still gonna be
the best of friends *

17:43.730 --> 17:45.465
* Wake up, make up

17:45.498 --> 17:47.500
* That's the way
we blend *

17:47.534 --> 17:49.269
* My girls!

17:49.302 --> 17:51.504
* We're all on the same team

17:51.538 --> 17:53.306
* My girls!

17:53.340 --> 17:55.342
* We're not here to play

17:55.375 --> 17:57.244
* My girls!

17:57.277 --> 17:59.112
*Living for the same dream

17:59.146 --> 18:00.113
* My girls!

18:00.147 --> 18:01.848
* Every day ay ay ay

18:01.881 --> 18:04.451
* We're the same that's
all it's ever been *

18:04.484 --> 18:06.653
* Way closer than all
our other friends *

18:06.686 --> 18:08.855
* You got me and I got you

18:08.888 --> 18:11.124
* We fight but in the end
we stick like glue *

18:11.158 --> 18:12.892
* Nothing now can
break us down *

18:12.925 --> 18:14.794
* We run this school
We'll rule this town *

18:14.827 --> 18:16.996
* Across this land
around the world *

18:17.029 --> 18:19.065
* Better watch out for
me and my girls *

18:19.098 --> 18:21.234
* My girls!

18:21.268 --> 18:23.270
* Noo, no, nooooooo

18:23.303 --> 18:24.404
* My girls!

18:24.437 --> 18:26.406
* Every day ay ay ay

18:26.439 --> 18:28.241
* My girls!

18:28.275 --> 18:30.243
* We're all on
the same team *

18:30.277 --> 18:31.911
* My girls!

18:31.944 --> 18:34.181
* We're not here to play

18:34.214 --> 18:35.748
* My girls!

18:35.782 --> 18:37.850
* Living for the
same dream *

18:37.884 --> 18:39.352
* My girls!

18:39.386 --> 18:42.655
* Every day ay ay ay

18:45.225 --> 18:49.095
Okay, that was
ah interesting.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.163
Should we run
it again?

18:50.197 --> 18:53.300
Maybe with a little less
obvious rivalry this time?

18:53.333 --> 18:54.501
I'm sorry.

18:54.534 --> 18:56.803
I can't dance with someone
who thinks I'd steal from her.

18:56.836 --> 19:00.039
Then maybe we shouldn't
dance together at all.

19:00.072 --> 19:01.874
Fine by me.

19:01.908 --> 19:03.075
But we're in a band!

19:03.109 --> 19:05.245
We have to
dance together!

19:05.278 --> 19:07.880
I gave up genius school
to perform with you two!

19:07.914 --> 19:09.816
Come back, please!

19:09.849 --> 19:12.852
No!

19:12.885 --> 19:15.188
Well, at least you
agree on something.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.156
*

19:17.190 --> 19:20.827
Want something done
right, you do it yourself!

19:20.860 --> 19:25.131
Riggghttttt.

19:25.164 --> 19:30.837
DJ Melly Starkhouse coming
at you with the big beats!!!

19:30.870 --> 19:32.239
Okay, party peoples...

19:32.272 --> 19:36.142
Here come the noises?

19:36.175 --> 19:40.146
Oh okay, how does
that make you feel?

19:40.179 --> 19:43.250
Here we go, that's
interesting.

19:43.283 --> 19:45.852
It makes me
wanna, dance.

19:45.885 --> 19:46.453
Here we go.

19:46.486 --> 19:47.454
Ouh.

19:47.487 --> 19:53.893
Call 9-1-1, cause they
should be at this party.

19:53.926 --> 19:55.595
Rightttt?

19:58.898 --> 19:59.932
This can't be right!

19:59.966 --> 20:01.868
My announcement about
doing a solo at Homecoming

20:01.901 --> 20:04.170
is only getting 50%
positive feedback.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.572
How many responses
did you get?

20:05.605 --> 20:07.173
Well, two.

20:07.206 --> 20:07.907
One's me.

20:07.940 --> 20:09.175
The other's my
little sister.

20:09.208 --> 20:12.178
She's a bit grouchy.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.581
Now's probably a good
time for me to tell you

20:14.614 --> 20:17.183
I'm not allowed to
DJ the dance.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.986
You know because of the whole
blowing up the gym thing.

20:20.019 --> 20:21.087
But my solo?!

20:21.120 --> 20:23.890
I mean, sorry to hear.

20:23.923 --> 20:25.224
Your solo will be great.

20:25.258 --> 20:27.927
Just you make sure you
perform with my track.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.963
I'll make sure the
new DJ does it, okay?

20:30.997 --> 20:33.466
Then Mr. Stark will
be so impressed,

20:33.500 --> 20:36.369
he'll beg me to do The
Wonderful Wizard of Oz.

20:36.403 --> 20:37.970
At least I hope so.

20:38.004 --> 20:38.938
Don't worry!

20:38.971 --> 20:42.141
We're a team and my
superior brain capacity

20:42.174 --> 20:43.476
will figure this out.

20:43.510 --> 20:44.877
You can count on me.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.879
Okay.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.315
Now please let me go.

20:48.348 --> 20:51.551
This outfit isn't
designed for hugging.

20:52.218 --> 20:54.421
For the tenth time, I
didn't steal your dress!

20:54.454 --> 21:00.493
And for the tenth time, I
didn't steal the dress either.

21:00.527 --> 21:01.794
Corki: "We have
your dress,

21:01.828 --> 21:03.363
Too bad neither of you
will get to wear it."

21:03.396 --> 21:06.032
Valerie: Have fun at
Homecoming girls!

21:06.065 --> 21:10.202
I hope I didn't cause you
too much "Diss Dress"

21:10.236 --> 21:13.205
Diss... Dress?

21:13.239 --> 21:13.573
Ugh...

21:13.606 --> 21:15.475
Whatever.

21:16.376 --> 21:18.345
Ms. Diona : Attention,
MacKendrick Prep

21:18.378 --> 21:20.313
students and faculty

21:20.347 --> 21:23.416
because repairs to the gym have
taken longer than expected,

21:23.450 --> 21:28.388
I regret to inform you that the
Homecoming dance is cancelled.
