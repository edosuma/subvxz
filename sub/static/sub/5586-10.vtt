01:19.905 --> 01:21.603
It's only 12.99.

01:21.690 --> 01:22.865
Ah, that's where
they get you, son.

01:22.952 --> 01:24.345
See, it says 12.99,

01:24.432 --> 01:26.042
but that doesn't include
the hidden costs--

01:26.129 --> 01:27.565

a $15 watch.

Malcolm, aren't you having

01:44.495 --> 01:46.323

Yep.

01:47.803 --> 01:49.021
Well, don't you think
it would be nice

01:49.109 --> 01:50.545
to get a little dressed up
for it?

01:50.632 --> 01:51.894
Why? I'm never going
to see these people again.

01:51.981 --> 01:53.069
They're just a bunch

about anything

it's just pathetic.

02:01.904 --> 02:03.079
I wouldn't have gone

02:03.166 --> 02:04.254

about it.

02:06.213 --> 02:07.823
You're really lucky you got
your old job back again.

02:07.910 --> 02:09.955
Lucky? They have me
on the delivery route,

02:10.042 --> 02:11.566

around all day.

02:11.653 --> 02:13.263
At least, when I worked
in the slaughterhouse,

02:13.350 --> 02:16.136
there were breaks every couple
of hours to find guys's fingers.

02:16.223 --> 02:17.963

02:24.666 --> 02:26.058
Are you kidding?

02:26.146 --> 02:27.625
This is how everyone's
going to remember us

02:27.712 --> 02:29.453

of our lives.

02:29.540 --> 02:31.020
Yeah, it's like
a time capsule.

02:31.107 --> 02:32.674
I mean, our children

02:32.761 --> 02:33.979
are going to look at these
pictures years from now

02:34.066 --> 02:35.546
to see what
we used to be like.

02:36.634 --> 02:38.332

Ooh, take that, society.

03:11.060 --> 03:12.279
Hi, Dewey.
How was school?

03:12.366 --> 03:14.237
Terrible!

03:14.324 --> 03:15.717
I missed the school bus because
I didn't know what time it was,

03:15.804 --> 03:17.327
and then I was late
for a spelling test

03:17.414 --> 03:19.111
because I didn't know
what time it was,

03:19.199 --> 03:21.113
and then
David Klausner beat me up

03:21.201 --> 03:23.072
because I didn't know
what time it was!

03:23.159 --> 03:24.595
You want to know
what time it is, Dewey?

03:24.682 --> 03:26.423
It's half past a roof
over your head,

03:26.510 --> 03:28.295
clean clothes,
and three meals a day.

03:28.382 --> 03:29.557
That's what time
it is!

03:29.644 --> 03:31.123
Let me tell you
something, Mom.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.647
The roof leaks, the clothes
are hand-me-downs,

03:32.734 --> 03:33.952
and the food stinks!

for a new card.

03:43.179 --> 03:46.443
-Oh, my God!
-What is it?

03:46.530 --> 03:49.794
It's a check for Malcolm
for $10,000!

03:49.881 --> 03:51.535
-What?! You're joking!
-No, no, no!

03:51.622 --> 03:54.408

could do with that!

could do with that.

What are you talking about?

04:11.773 --> 04:13.688
Nothing.

04:13.775 --> 04:15.646
All I'm saying is that
we can do a lot

04:15.733 --> 04:17.082
with this kind of money.

04:17.168 --> 04:19.214
But it's not ours, Hal.
It's Malcolm's.

04:19.302 --> 04:20.825
Of course it's Malcolm's.

04:20.911 --> 04:22.653
But we have to take a moment

04:22.740 --> 04:25.961
to think about what a teenager
is going to do with $10,000.

04:26.048 --> 04:27.397
Well, you know
he's just going

04:27.484 --> 04:30.748
to blow it all on Legos
and penny candy.

to go to, right?

he's got

04:43.326 --> 04:44.893

but right now

04:44.980 --> 04:46.242
it is being held hostage

04:46.329 --> 04:49.550
by gallons
of crazy teenage hormones.

04:49.637 --> 04:51.987
All I'm saying is maybe
we should hold onto this

04:52.074 --> 04:53.380
for a little while

04:53.467 --> 04:55.730

what to do with it.

09:56.857 --> 10:00.077
the decision of hot
or cold water entirely up to us!

10:00.164 --> 10:03.037
Yes, well, we could spend
the money on new pipes,

a down payment

Lois, I was on my way to work
when, all of a sudden,

It's not wasting.
It's investing.

that money!

I'm going to get the money.

12:54.164 --> 12:55.775
It's not there anymore.
I moved it.

12:55.862 --> 12:57.124
I know.

12:57.211 --> 12:58.952
I moved it from where
you moved it.

12:59.039 --> 13:00.475
-And I moved it again.
-What?

13:00.562 --> 13:01.824
I was the one who came
up with this idea...

13:01.911 --> 13:03.130
You did the same...

-The money's safe.
-Give it!

is he to boss me around?

with a little spirit.

lie about the house,

Miami Vice and MTVs.

No, some are like that,

still have some life left.

over to him?

No, I don't think that
would be a good idea.

to have romances around here.

14:08.108 --> 14:09.500
It's as if
they don't think

14:09.587 --> 14:12.416
we're capable of having
feelings anymore.

14:12.503 --> 14:13.765
That is totally unfair!

I mean,
as long as the two of you

14:15.637 --> 14:17.291
can see each other naked and
still keep your lunches down,

14:17.378 --> 14:19.815
you should be able to do
whatever it is you want to do.

14:19.902 --> 14:21.425

seniors' names, helped lug

14:28.955 --> 14:31.087
your equipment for three days
from here to your shop,

14:31.174 --> 14:32.872
and I held the lights for those
creepy photo shoots.

14:32.959 --> 14:35.135
You have to take
another picture of me.

14:35.222 --> 14:36.614

of the bargain,

hold up, mister.

the money again.

better when we know

15:29.102 --> 15:30.538
it's all here.

By the way, I'm going to need
some of this.

15:32.583 --> 15:34.759
I got an estimate
to fix my transmission.

15:34.846 --> 15:37.371
This receipt is from 1986, Hal!

15:37.458 --> 15:39.373
I can see where you
erased the date!

15:39.460 --> 15:41.114
-Amateur.
-Oh, yeah?

15:41.201 --> 15:42.506
Well, how do I know this
plumber's for real,

15:42.593 --> 15:44.639
and not just some actor
that you hired?

15:44.726 --> 15:47.250
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I held
auditions while you
were at work, Hal!

15:47.337 --> 15:48.686
I knew it!

15:48.773 --> 15:50.427
Listen to yourself!
You've gone insane!

That would be pretty convenient
for you, wouldn't it?

Well, you are not
locking me away!

15:54.649 --> 15:56.607
I haven't trusted either of you
since I was six!

All right, all right,
let's just split it.

15:58.740 --> 16:00.960
Three ways,
and we'll all be happy.

16:01.047 --> 16:02.831
I wouldn't say happy,
but it's a start.

16:02.918 --> 16:05.007
I have a better idea.

16:05.094 --> 16:08.489
We just stop this nonsense and
give the money back to Malcolm.

16:08.576 --> 16:10.752
Okay, you can have your pipes.

16:10.839 --> 16:12.928
No, Hal, this isn't
a bargaining tool.

16:13.015 --> 16:15.409
This money has turned
us into animals.

16:15.496 --> 16:17.150
I'm going down to the bank
tomorrow morning

16:17.237 --> 16:19.369
and getting a cashier's check
in Malcolm's name.

16:19.456 --> 16:21.371
Then the three of us
can slink away and forget

16:21.458 --> 16:23.025
that this whole thing
ever happened.

16:23.112 --> 16:24.896
Oh!

16:24.984 --> 16:27.073
Can't you control that woman?

16:27.160 --> 16:29.249
Watch your tone, young man!

16:29.336 --> 16:30.685
Or else what?

16:30.772 --> 16:32.426
You'll just cave,
like you did with Mom.

16:32.513 --> 16:34.558
All right, that's it!
Go to your room!

16:37.909 --> 16:40.738
I think maybe we should
both go to our rooms.

17:35.793 --> 17:37.708
I think some of these
are Viagra. Go for it.

17:37.795 --> 17:39.536
What can we do to repay you?

17:39.623 --> 17:42.148
Give me
a five-minute head start.

17:45.020 --> 17:46.413
[clears throat]

17:46.500 --> 17:49.329
Honey, we want
to apologize.

17:49.416 --> 17:51.548
Yeah.
You were right.

17:51.635 --> 17:53.333
We were turning
into monsters.

17:53.420 --> 17:54.812
The bad kind.

17:54.899 --> 17:56.727
You're just so much
stronger than we are.

17:56.814 --> 17:58.686
Thank God for your
levelheadedness.

17:58.773 --> 18:00.122
Thank God there was
someone in this house

18:00.209 --> 18:01.993
who was able to
keep their sanity.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.344
And you taught us a lot
of important lessons

18:04.431 --> 18:06.128
about honesty and trust.

18:07.347 --> 18:09.610
So... if you'll
just tell us

18:09.697 --> 18:11.046
where you hid the money...

18:14.441 --> 18:17.574
-I've done something very bad.
-What?

18:22.405 --> 18:26.540
There was this antique store
across the street from the bank,

18:26.627 --> 18:28.890
and I saw this dollhouse
in the window.

18:28.977 --> 18:30.979
And, the next thing I knew,
I was walking out with it.

18:31.066 --> 18:32.067
It was like that money

18:32.154 --> 18:34.025
in my pocket killed the old Lois

18:34.113 --> 18:36.506
and replaced her
with a crazy person.

18:36.593 --> 18:38.421
It's okay, honey.
I mean...

18:38.508 --> 18:40.728
So what if you spent a couple
hundred dollars on a dollhouse?

18:40.815 --> 18:42.512
It's no big deal.

18:42.599 --> 18:43.861
Now, where's
the rest of the money?

18:43.948 --> 18:45.385
There isn't any.

18:45.472 --> 18:47.213
-What?!
-You-You spent

18:47.300 --> 18:50.781
$10,000 on
a stupid dollhouse?!

18:50.868 --> 18:51.913
They wanted 12.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.001
But look, Hal...

18:55.090 --> 18:56.787

No!

19:09.278 --> 19:11.672
Oh... no.

19:11.759 --> 19:13.587
Hi, Judith.

19:13.674 --> 19:15.806
Oh, hello, Reese.

19:15.893 --> 19:19.984
I want to thank you so much
for everything you've done.

19:20.071 --> 19:22.073
It felt good to do
something nice for a change.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.902
I'm seriously thinking about
peppering that into
my repertoire.

19:24.989 --> 19:28.602
Are you the one
who helped Judith and Teddy
get together yesterday?

19:28.689 --> 19:30.647
Yes, I am, and I would
do it again.

19:30.734 --> 19:32.432
Your rules are just stupid.

19:32.519 --> 19:34.477
I mean, who does it hurt
to let two old people be happy?

19:34.564 --> 19:36.392
You whore!

19:36.479 --> 19:38.046
You stole my husband!

19:39.003 --> 19:43.051
No, I just used him
without your permission

19:43.138 --> 19:45.619
and gave him back to you...

19:45.706 --> 19:49.057
Just like someone did
with my sewing machine.

19:50.319 --> 19:52.843
Look at her.
I couldn't say no!

19:52.930 --> 19:54.367
How can you say no to that?

19:54.454 --> 19:57.196
Oh, shut up,
you old fool!

19:57.283 --> 19:58.980
Wait! I can fix this!

19:59.067 --> 20:01.417
Just get back at him by
sleeping with someone else!

20:02.549 --> 20:04.115
How about him?

20:04.203 --> 20:06.248
[grunts]

20:06.335 --> 20:08.207
When he has his teeth in,
he's quite the looker!

20:13.255 --> 20:14.952
Okay, I sold my car.

20:15.039 --> 20:17.607
Well, we'll add that to what
I got for my engagement ring

20:17.694 --> 20:19.522
and my grandmother's pearls.

20:19.609 --> 20:21.568
No one wanted to buy my bike,

20:21.655 --> 20:25.702
but a bunch of kids did pay
to watch me eat a centipede.

20:25.789 --> 20:28.531
We're doing the right thing.
We should all remember that.

20:28.618 --> 20:30.229
Quit sermonizing.

20:30.316 --> 20:32.927
I'll get enough of that from
the nut-jobs on the bus.

20:35.799 --> 20:37.888
You guys aren't

20:37.975 --> 20:39.412
I got a McClellan
Fellowship grant

20:39.499 --> 20:42.589

20:42.676 --> 20:44.547
That's wonderful, Malcolm!

20:44.634 --> 20:46.245
Congratulations, son.

20:46.332 --> 20:47.985
Yeah, congratulations.

20:48.072 --> 20:49.857
This couldn't have come
at a better time!

I know exactly what
I'm gonna do with it!
