00:02.001 --> 00:09.009
Previously on "survivor," at the
healer tribe, Joe interrogated

00:11.011 --> 00:13.114
I personally think you have
the idol.

00:13.147 --> 00:14.182
I wish I did.

00:14.215 --> 00:16.884
Mike is public enemy number
one.

00:16.917 --> 00:20.354
At the hustler tribe, Patrick
found his partner in crime.

00:20.388 --> 00:21.355
I got your back.

00:21.389 --> 00:23.924
I got you back if you got
mine.

00:23.957 --> 00:26.627
JEFF: And Ryan confessed to
having the super idol.

00:26.660 --> 00:30.698
If we don't go to trial, I
have to give it to someone else.

00:30.731 --> 00:33.834
JEFF: The hero tribal was
facing tribal council, and a

00:33.867 --> 00:34.668
core four came together.

00:34.702 --> 00:36.704
I wanted us four from the
beginning.

00:36.737 --> 00:38.839
JEFF: Which put the two
moms on the outs?

00:38.872 --> 00:40.007
Do you think it's you because
I think it's me?

00:40.040 --> 00:43.577
JEFF: But Chrissy received
Ryan's super idol.

00:43.611 --> 00:46.480
It can only be used at
tonight's tribal council.

00:46.514 --> 00:51.419
JEFF: At tribal council,
Alan accused j.P. And Ashley of

00:51.452 --> 00:52.553
being a power couple.

00:52.586 --> 00:56.390
To have the term "power
couple" even thrown around is

00:56.424 --> 00:57.325
ridiculous.

00:57.358 --> 00:59.360
I know what I know, and I'm
in the crazy.

00:59.393 --> 01:00.594
I'm confident.

01:00.628 --> 01:08.502
JEFF: In the end, the
alliance of four stuck together.

01:08.536 --> 01:10.638
Katrina, the tribe has spoken.

01:10.671 --> 01:16.444
And Chrissy decided not to save
Katrina, holding on to her

01:16.477 --> 01:18.112
secret but now powerless idol.

01:18.146 --> 01:19.147
17 are left.

01:19.180 --> 01:26.454
Who will be voted out tonight?

01:26.487 --> 01:32.025
I'm happy to take a walk to
the watering hole.

01:32.059 --> 01:35.929
I'll get water at night
before I go to tribal again.

01:35.963 --> 01:36.764
Let's never go there again.

01:36.797 --> 01:38.065
That was brutal.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.567
I never want to go again.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.670
Tribal council was really
heated and angry.

01:42.703 --> 01:44.705
Great for me, right?

01:44.738 --> 01:47.308
I started out on the bottom.

01:47.341 --> 01:50.478
Now I think that I'm no longer
on the bottom because all these

01:50.511 --> 01:54.014
other cracks come up because
people do it to themselves.

01:54.047 --> 01:55.048
Wow.

01:55.082 --> 01:55.549
Good job.

01:55.583 --> 01:56.784
Yeah.

01:56.817 --> 02:03.924
I was also glad that I did
not use the super immunity ID.L.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.660
Idol, because in the
future I can use it as a decoy.

02:06.694 --> 02:08.696
It has no power, but it still
has power.

02:12.065 --> 02:15.603
I don't plan on going back to
that.

02:15.636 --> 02:16.637
Not at all.

02:16.670 --> 02:18.772
Tribal council was intense.

02:18.806 --> 02:24.077
I mean, I was not expecting
fists to start flying like that.

02:24.111 --> 02:27.014
But at the end of the day, I
think I got what I wanted in

02:27.047 --> 02:30.618
terms of people really thinking
that Ashley and j.P. Are a power

02:30.651 --> 02:34.154
couple, so my plan worked
essentially, like whether I'm

02:34.188 --> 02:37.658
right or whether I'm wrong, I
think I created some kind of

02:37.691 --> 02:38.792
suspicion.

02:38.826 --> 02:43.397
A lot of times suspicion gets
you the results you want.

02:43.431 --> 02:46.334
First of all, how do you
convince people of something

02:46.367 --> 02:47.968
when you have in proof?

02:48.001 --> 02:49.670
You know what I mean?

02:49.703 --> 02:52.440
I'm trying to convince you I
don't have something and that me

02:52.473 --> 02:56.744
and j.P. Are not... as soon as
the word "power couple" got

02:56.777 --> 02:59.247
thrown into it, oh, my gosh,
that's crazy.

02:59.280 --> 03:02.883
The whole spectacle that Alan
created tonight at tribal

03:02.916 --> 03:06.587
council just kind of showed
everyone how off the hinges he

03:06.620 --> 03:07.855
really is.

03:07.888 --> 03:09.990
I'm not going to sit become and
tell my whole tribe that I'm in

03:10.023 --> 03:13.261
a power duo with j.P. And we're
hiding idols.

03:13.294 --> 03:17.365
I think he went from a really
safe place with the core four to

03:17.398 --> 03:19.833
now putting a huge target on his
back.

03:19.867 --> 03:22.703
>>
Do you guys believe me?

03:22.736 --> 03:24.538
I'm starting to believe you
more.

03:24.572 --> 03:25.739
Thank you.

03:25.773 --> 03:28.509
Alan has to keep it under
wraps period.

03:28.542 --> 03:29.977
He has.

03:30.010 --> 03:33.514
To I I don't understand what
he's doing.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.082
The group is like old paint.

03:35.115 --> 03:36.917
It's cracked and fractured
everywhere.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.386
I'm not sure who I can trust.

03:38.419 --> 03:39.520
The core four is gone.

03:39.553 --> 03:42.423
The perception might be there in
some people's heads, not

03:42.456 --> 03:43.791
actually, no, it's not.

03:43.824 --> 03:44.392
It's done.

03:44.425 --> 03:46.159
The whole thing is shot.

03:46.193 --> 03:48.195
Now it's every man for himself.

03:50.000 --> 03:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:28.268 --> 04:36.577
Look at that, baby.

04:36.610 --> 04:39.347
Okay.

04:39.380 --> 04:43.016
We have definitely as the
days have gone on really owned

04:43.050 --> 04:44.151
the hustler mantra.

04:44.184 --> 04:45.285
I cobust my bum.

04:45.319 --> 04:48.021
The hustler tribe is feeling
really good about itself.

04:48.055 --> 04:49.423
We have some momentum now.

04:49.457 --> 04:52.326
I think I'm in a pretty good
spot socially.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.094
I feel like me and you are doing
okay.

04:54.127 --> 04:54.962
We're doing good.

04:54.995 --> 04:58.265
We're doing okay.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.401
I think we're the best
players in our tribe.

05:00.434 --> 05:02.269
For sure.

05:02.302 --> 05:05.272
Everyone else, when I talk to
them, I'm not smiling when I

05:05.305 --> 05:07.875
I'm like, oh, okay, I'm all
serious.

05:07.908 --> 05:11.412
But with you I'm able to talk
strategy and have a smile on my

05:11.445 --> 05:11.979
face.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.714
I think we're tight.

05:13.747 --> 05:14.748
We're lock-step.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.717
We've gotten along so well.

05:16.750 --> 05:19.753
Honestly, I feel like I've
connected with everybody on my

05:19.787 --> 05:23.357
tribe, maybe Nazi moan, but I
don't think anybody has a

05:23.391 --> 05:24.892
connection with Simone.

05:24.925 --> 05:28.796
She's weird, and weirdness, you
want to blend in on these first

05:28.829 --> 05:32.833
couple days, and the people who
blend in the best are the ones

05:32.866 --> 05:33.200
that escape.

05:33.233 --> 05:35.936
I did it!

05:35.969 --> 05:36.737
Yes.

05:36.770 --> 05:37.505
Oh, my god.

05:37.538 --> 05:39.339
But it was terrifying.

05:39.373 --> 05:41.041
I'm not an outside person.

05:41.074 --> 05:44.077
The fact that I was leaving
myself in the water was the

05:44.111 --> 05:44.945
biggest milestone.

05:44.978 --> 05:46.647
I can't believe I did that.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.081
I feel like a super hero.

05:48.115 --> 05:48.882
Awesome.

05:48.916 --> 05:50.551
And that's your superpower.

05:50.584 --> 05:51.385
Yeah.

05:51.419 --> 05:53.721
I know people think this is
paradise.

05:53.754 --> 05:56.624
But it's tough out here and it's
hot all the time and there is no

05:56.657 --> 05:57.458
air conditioning.

05:57.491 --> 05:58.959
I hate the outside.

05:58.992 --> 06:02.062
You hate the outside in we're
outside right now.

06:02.095 --> 06:03.163
We're in the outside.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.832
I'm challenging myself.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.934
I'm having an adventure.

06:06.967 --> 06:09.603
I'm trying to try new things.

06:09.637 --> 06:12.072
I think people look at me and
think here is this person who

06:12.105 --> 06:15.943
has no experience in the
outdoors, but, you know, I'm a

06:15.976 --> 06:17.611
hustler because I'm good under
pressure.

06:17.645 --> 06:19.547
So who is going to gut the
fish?

06:19.580 --> 06:21.081
I'll clean the fish.

06:21.114 --> 06:22.015
I've never done it before.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.350
You've never done it before?

06:23.383 --> 06:25.152
I read up on how to do it.

06:25.185 --> 06:27.054
Just don't cut your finger.

06:27.087 --> 06:27.721
You got it.

06:27.755 --> 06:28.255
All right.

06:28.288 --> 06:29.490
Get it.

06:29.523 --> 06:32.760
"Survivor" might push me to
my limits, but I've been playing

06:32.793 --> 06:33.861
"survivor" my entire life.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.128
I live on a tribe.

06:35.162 --> 06:38.599
I have ten brothers and sisters,
so I was fighting constantly to

06:38.632 --> 06:39.066
outperform everybody.

06:39.099 --> 06:39.467
Nice.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.100
All right.

06:40.133 --> 06:41.334
Hey, you did a good job.

06:41.368 --> 06:45.172
I plan on gaining everybody's
respect by just working hard,

06:45.205 --> 06:46.406
because this is the hustler
tribe.

06:46.440 --> 06:52.312
This is the work ethic tribe.

06:52.345 --> 06:54.815
How have you been doing,
Simone?

06:54.848 --> 06:55.983
I've been adjusting.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.685
Gutting that fish, that's a
big deal.

06:57.718 --> 07:00.253
I can tell you're putting
yourself out there, you're

07:00.287 --> 07:02.355
putting yourself out there to do
things you normally wouldn't do.

07:02.389 --> 07:05.793
>>
This game is all about handling

07:05.826 --> 07:07.060
different personalities.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.630
I think it's something I'm good
at, and I don't know if everyone

07:09.663 --> 07:13.767
is thinking, oh, Simone is the
diva, I don't want to deal with,

07:13.801 --> 07:16.303
that but I see Simone's value at
this time.

07:16.336 --> 07:19.840
Being here with a whole bunch of
random people is a big step for

07:19.873 --> 07:21.041
her.

07:21.074 --> 07:22.676
I definitely could use that to
my advantage and kind of pull

07:22.710 --> 07:25.178
Simone on to my side.

07:25.212 --> 07:27.548
You keep doubting yourself.

07:27.581 --> 07:31.785
I think you need to be more
optimistic in how you think.

07:31.819 --> 07:34.522
If you think less of you, other
people will think less.

07:34.555 --> 07:37.124
You have to hype yourself up,
because if you don't, who else

07:37.157 --> 07:38.058
will?

07:38.091 --> 07:40.027
I could see her being loyal for
a long time.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.695
I could definitely mold her.

07:41.729 --> 07:42.830
I'm here to win.

07:42.863 --> 07:47.835
So I feel like Simone, I could
use as putty in my hands.

08:08.922 --> 08:12.660
This is the worst game of cat
and mouse ever.

08:12.693 --> 08:13.527
Yes.

08:13.561 --> 08:16.029
It's really frustrating.

08:16.063 --> 08:17.565
I keep shooting at the same one.

08:17.598 --> 08:18.532
It will happen.

08:18.566 --> 08:21.101
I feel so disappointed.

08:21.134 --> 08:22.469
Don't.

08:22.502 --> 08:23.704
I want the try again.

08:23.737 --> 08:24.872
Yeah.

08:24.905 --> 08:28.341
I think Jessica is super
cute, although she just turned

08:28.375 --> 08:31.945
30, so she probably sees me as
some little kid and doesn't even

08:31.979 --> 08:34.514
give me a sideways look, but
she's a great person to be

08:34.548 --> 08:35.182
around.

08:35.215 --> 08:36.917
I'm digging the energy a lot.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.719
I think I make too much noise.

08:38.751 --> 08:40.419
Sometimes I talk to them.

08:40.453 --> 08:43.924
That's super cute.

08:43.957 --> 08:44.992
We do flirt a lot.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.595
Maybe if I keep catching her
fish, she'll come over.

08:47.628 --> 08:48.729
She's a cool girl.

08:48.762 --> 08:51.799
Like I could see myself with
her.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.567
You were miss Virginia twice.

08:53.601 --> 08:55.769
When were you miss Virginia?

08:55.803 --> 08:57.004
What year?

08:57.037 --> 09:02.075
I was miss Virginia 2013 in
the American system and 2014 in

09:02.109 --> 09:03.210
the U.S.A. system.

09:03.243 --> 09:06.246
We're on the wrong tribe, and
there's a beauty tribe.

09:06.279 --> 09:07.615
We the ugly ones.

09:07.648 --> 09:09.549
Everyone on this tribe except
me is hot and smart.

09:09.583 --> 09:13.320
You definitely have the
smarts, bro, the beauty, you is

09:13.353 --> 09:14.855
one ugly dude, but you're still
smart.

09:14.888 --> 09:15.656
Thanks.

09:15.689 --> 09:17.390
I'm okay with that.

09:17.424 --> 09:19.960
We're definitely in the wrong
tribe, Mike.

09:19.993 --> 09:22.896
My relationship with Mike is
he's still my public enemy

09:22.930 --> 09:25.298
number one, but he's definitely
growing on me.

09:25.332 --> 09:28.602
He's a likable guy and I kind of
like him, but not enough to keep

09:28.636 --> 09:29.703
him around.

09:29.737 --> 09:32.139
So I'm still feeding everyone
that Mike has the idol.

09:32.172 --> 09:35.876
I truly don't know if he has the
idol or not, so now it's kind of

09:35.909 --> 09:38.646
almost like backfired on me
because now I can't look for the

09:38.679 --> 09:41.214
idol as much as I want the look
for the idol.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.283
So I'm trying to figure ways to
leave camp.

09:43.316 --> 09:45.552
All right.

09:45.585 --> 09:46.186
Are we well, ?

09:46.219 --> 09:47.721
See you in ten, Joe.

09:47.755 --> 09:48.656
Cool.

09:48.689 --> 09:52.259
The window is a very, very
small window.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.662
But, you know, I could
accomplish a lot of things in a

09:54.695 --> 10:06.173
small time.

10:06.206 --> 10:08.942
I wonder how long we've been
gone.

10:08.976 --> 10:10.978
A couple hours.

10:23.556 --> 10:24.257
Wow.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.125
There it is.

10:25.158 --> 10:27.560
It's a clue.

10:27.594 --> 10:33.300
Ocean, looks like a raft, five
feet, I found a clue.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.602
And it looks like a map to the
idol.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.504
I think it's a raft.

10:37.537 --> 10:38.505
It looks like a raft.

10:38.538 --> 10:42.175
When I see it, automatically I
think of Cole.

10:42.209 --> 10:43.410
Cole has been out there fishing.

10:43.443 --> 10:45.578
So I'm going to talk about it
with him.

10:45.612 --> 10:46.714
Hopefully he opens up to me.

10:46.747 --> 10:49.850
If not he'll definitely trust me
that I'm giving him some

10:49.883 --> 10:51.418
information.

10:51.451 --> 10:53.586
I haven't really explored.

10:53.620 --> 10:54.354
Right.

10:54.387 --> 10:57.224
But I found an idol clue
today.

10:57.257 --> 10:57.825
Really?

10:57.858 --> 10:59.426
It's marked on a tree.

10:59.459 --> 11:01.128
So it's in the a physical clue.

11:01.161 --> 11:05.833
It's a square, like a raft, and
it said, ocean, five feet.

11:05.866 --> 11:07.300
You've been out there swimming
all day.

11:07.334 --> 11:10.170
I just assumed you had it and
didn't tell nobody, which is

11:10.203 --> 11:10.804
cool.

11:10.838 --> 11:13.173
I haven't gotten it yet.

11:13.206 --> 11:14.141
It's there.

11:14.174 --> 11:15.809
Where is the clue?

11:15.843 --> 11:18.779
It's all the way in the back
where the rocks are.

11:18.812 --> 11:22.816
Joe brought me in on the fact
there's a clue I can't see.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.051
I am beside myself.

11:24.084 --> 11:26.987
This is the greatest day ever so
far, and this is why I'm here

11:27.020 --> 11:30.824
the play survivor is to find the
ID.L. And have the power, but

11:30.858 --> 11:33.226
I'm suspicious that the idol is
on the raft because I've been

11:33.260 --> 11:35.028
out fishing all day.

11:35.062 --> 11:39.432
So I'm like, dude, I need to see
this clue.

11:39.466 --> 11:41.802
That's the clue.

11:41.835 --> 11:43.871
Five feet, ocean, raft.

11:43.904 --> 11:46.106
No, no, no, no, no,.

11:46.139 --> 11:50.878
That's the symbol for the well
on the map.

11:50.911 --> 11:53.446
That's the symbol for the well.

11:53.480 --> 11:56.817
So five feet from the well, x
marks the spot.

11:56.850 --> 12:01.588
That's the symbol for the well.

12:01.621 --> 12:05.325
Dude, it's second nature for me
to enable people and help them

12:05.358 --> 12:06.526
accomplish their goals.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.561
That skill set I feel like is
giving me power in this game.

12:08.595 --> 12:12.232
Since Joe would have never found
that out by himself, he probably

12:12.265 --> 12:21.474
sees me as a really good
resource now.

12:21.508 --> 12:27.014
Showing Cole the clue was a
major risk, but I needed help.

12:27.047 --> 12:30.350
Like I don't honestly think I
would have figured it out on my

12:30.383 --> 12:31.118
own.

12:31.151 --> 12:37.090
It's now or never.

12:37.124 --> 12:40.193
In my mind if anything pops
out of that ground, I'm

12:40.227 --> 12:40.861
snatching it.

12:40.894 --> 12:41.995
I want it.

12:42.029 --> 12:44.264
And I'm going to find it today.

12:44.297 --> 12:45.065
Got it.

12:45.098 --> 12:55.042
Yeah.

12:55.075 --> 12:56.209
I got the idol.

12:56.243 --> 12:56.977
It feels good.

12:57.010 --> 12:58.311
I feel good.

12:58.345 --> 13:04.017
That's the idol.

13:04.051 --> 13:07.754
Now I know no one else has
it, but I'm concerned because

13:07.787 --> 13:10.891
the fact that Cole knows I have
the idol can absolutely

13:10.924 --> 13:11.658
backfire.

13:11.691 --> 13:12.559
It's all about power and
knowledge.

13:12.592 --> 13:13.827
He has too much knowledge.

13:13.861 --> 13:16.563
I don't think he's going to use
it against me, but at the same

13:16.596 --> 13:18.598
time, if he does, I might have
to put target on his back.

13:44.824 --> 13:45.959
It's all about getting things
done and taking care of

13:45.993 --> 13:47.127
business.

13:47.160 --> 13:50.130
So I'm out fishing, trying to
get some board, and just one

13:50.163 --> 13:51.198
step at a time and go from
there.

13:51.231 --> 13:53.100
He's walking up with
something.

13:53.133 --> 13:55.802
I think that's a lobster.

13:55.835 --> 13:56.503
No way.

13:56.536 --> 13:57.437
It's something.

13:57.470 --> 13:58.972
He got something.

13:59.006 --> 14:03.276
I have never really been
super big enter drama or the

14:03.310 --> 14:05.812
confrontational type or anything
like that, so if I can get some

14:05.845 --> 14:09.682
fish, some lobster, things like,
that make sure everybody has a

14:09.716 --> 14:12.585
full belly, I think everyone
will be happy and taken care of.

14:12.619 --> 14:13.486
Oh, my gosh.

14:13.520 --> 14:14.387
Nicely done.

14:14.421 --> 14:15.422
That is meat.

14:15.455 --> 14:16.957
That is delicious.

14:16.990 --> 14:20.627
The other night at tribal,
ash and I got called out as the

14:20.660 --> 14:21.428
power couple.

14:21.461 --> 14:22.595
That label sucks.

14:22.629 --> 14:25.265
I don't see ourselves as a power
couple at all.

14:25.298 --> 14:26.333
We're not dating.

14:26.366 --> 14:27.767
We're not hooking up.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.802
We're not doing any of that type
of stuff.

14:29.836 --> 14:33.040
If we're a power couple, we
might as well hook up and be a

14:33.073 --> 14:33.974
couple.

14:34.007 --> 14:36.109
Might as well take advantage of
everything.

14:36.143 --> 14:40.280
So ash and my connection is more
on the backburner now, but in

14:40.313 --> 14:43.650
the fire house, that's what my
profession is, staying calm in

14:43.683 --> 14:44.884
an emergency situation.

14:44.918 --> 14:47.287
I might not be the guy out there
talking strategy to everybody,

14:47.320 --> 14:52.325
but I know that I need to clean
my rep up a little with bit and

14:52.359 --> 14:53.493
straighten things out.

14:53.526 --> 14:56.063
Obviously ash and I don't
have an idol and obviously ash

14:56.096 --> 14:57.064
andry not a couple.

14:57.097 --> 14:58.265
How is everything else going?

14:58.298 --> 14:59.066
Good.

14:59.099 --> 14:59.666
I'm feeling good.

14:59.699 --> 15:00.900
Good.

15:00.934 --> 15:04.504
I needed to get through that
first tribal so I could get a

15:04.537 --> 15:05.638
foothold and I got through it.

15:05.672 --> 15:08.375
Now I really this believe that I
can go far in this game.

15:08.408 --> 15:11.945
I just need to figure out who I
want to move forward with,

15:11.979 --> 15:14.948
because I do believe that you
need a strong partner to get to

15:14.982 --> 15:15.682
the end of the game.

15:15.715 --> 15:17.951
What about game?

15:17.985 --> 15:19.886
Let's pretend me and you.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.088
Yeah.

15:21.121 --> 15:24.357
People would never say he
would go with her and she would

15:24.391 --> 15:25.258
go with him.

15:25.292 --> 15:26.893
We wouldn't get labeled a
power couple.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.228
That's true.

15:28.261 --> 15:29.896
You know what I mean?

15:29.929 --> 15:34.167
So what I do as an actuary is
analyze data and figure out what

15:34.201 --> 15:37.037
is my next best moving giving
everything I know some here's

15:37.070 --> 15:42.009
what I know... j.P. Can be
helpful in challenge, but

15:42.042 --> 15:44.077
truthfully I don't think he's
that smart.

15:44.111 --> 15:48.848
I think j.P. And Alan both want
each other out almost.

15:48.881 --> 15:49.716
Yeah, yeah.

15:49.749 --> 15:51.618
I'm worried Alan wants me
out.

15:51.651 --> 15:56.189
Ashley is a very good player,
but I don't entire trust Ashley.

15:56.223 --> 15:59.292
I am not convinced there is not
a power couple.

15:59.326 --> 16:00.360
We're solid?

16:00.393 --> 16:02.129
Yeah, we're solid.

16:02.162 --> 16:05.632
Then after Alan had his
blow-up, I'm concerned about

16:05.665 --> 16:08.168
having a twosome with Alan.

16:08.201 --> 16:11.038
At this point the data shows
that Ben is a better option for

16:11.071 --> 16:13.840
me.

16:13.873 --> 16:18.978
Ben has a lot of social charm,
and I can think several steps

16:19.012 --> 16:23.350
ahead strategically, so together
we complement each other very

16:23.383 --> 16:25.685
well.

16:25.718 --> 16:29.622
Right now we have two options,
you, me, and Ashley, or you,

16:29.656 --> 16:30.790
men, and Alan.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.292
Let Alan think he's with us.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.726
Let Ashley think she's with us.

16:33.760 --> 16:34.961
J.P. Doesn't talk to anybody.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.896
Who knows what the heck his game
is.

16:36.929 --> 16:38.831
As we stay together.

16:38.865 --> 16:39.966
You and me, yes.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.335
This is crazy how this is
going.

16:42.369 --> 16:43.270
Totally crazy.

16:43.303 --> 16:46.439
Alan and I were aligned from
the get-go.

16:46.473 --> 16:48.875
But after he blew up at tribal
the other night, I don't know if

16:48.908 --> 16:50.343
I can work with him.

16:50.377 --> 16:53.813
Chrissy is a smart woman, and
she has a good head on her

16:53.846 --> 16:54.814
shoulders.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.317
That's going to help me get
further in the game.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.118
I'm in.

16:58.151 --> 16:59.319
Like this is crazy.

16:59.352 --> 17:00.820
We're good.

17:00.853 --> 17:01.821
We're safe.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.523
We can totally ride this out
the entire way.

17:03.556 --> 17:04.991
We can ride it out the entire
way.

17:05.023 --> 17:08.694
At this point Chrissy andry
in the driver's seat, and

17:08.728 --> 17:12.265
whatever we decide to do is
what's going to happen.

17:12.299 --> 17:12.898
So let's do this.

17:12.932 --> 17:14.233
Let's do it.

17:14.267 --> 17:15.102
Let's totally do it.

17:15.135 --> 17:17.270
But no more talking between
you and I.

17:17.304 --> 17:19.339
No, we are not a power
couple.

17:19.372 --> 17:32.885
I don't even know you.

17:39.159 --> 17:40.160
Huge crab.

17:40.193 --> 17:41.294
Look at that!

17:41.328 --> 17:44.464
This thing has claws like
enormous.

17:44.497 --> 17:45.165
I got us a meal.

17:45.198 --> 17:47.834
Geez, look at those claws.

17:47.867 --> 17:49.769
Grab it, dude.

17:49.802 --> 17:50.703
Ow!

17:50.737 --> 17:51.904
Has he got you?

17:51.938 --> 17:52.839
Are you hurt.

17:52.872 --> 17:54.974
No.

17:55.007 --> 17:56.643
What is your problem?

17:56.676 --> 18:00.213
What is wrong with you?

18:00.247 --> 18:04.717
Why do you have to do that alin
my face.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.219
They're so scary.

18:06.253 --> 18:07.354
I'm scared of crabs.

18:07.387 --> 18:11.057
So I should probably
continuinger my fear because I'm

18:11.090 --> 18:15.162
a lot bigger than that crab.

18:15.195 --> 18:15.928
He's moving.

18:15.962 --> 18:19.031
What is he going to do.

18:19.065 --> 18:20.032
Holy geez.

18:20.066 --> 18:22.635
I'm a wild banshee.

18:22.669 --> 18:24.971
I'm someone what wants to have a
good time all the time.

18:25.004 --> 18:27.540
My strategy is to keep everyone
having fun.

18:27.574 --> 18:30.477
When you do that, you don't have
to worry about being the

18:30.510 --> 18:35.315
bull's-eye.

18:35.348 --> 18:38.185
Dancing skills, what would
you say your dancing skills are

18:38.218 --> 18:38.485
like?

18:38.518 --> 18:40.587
Zero.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.989
You do any performing at
night?

18:43.022 --> 18:43.923
What about in the shower?

18:43.956 --> 18:47.327
No, I might fall and break my
neck.

18:47.360 --> 18:51.364
>>
Patrick is starting to get

18:51.398 --> 18:52.965
on my nerves.

18:52.999 --> 18:54.601
He wants to be in the spotlight.

18:54.634 --> 18:59.906
I'll do my Australian accent.

18:59.939 --> 19:02.742
Want to put some shrimp on the
Barbie.

19:02.775 --> 19:03.243
We'll mingle.

19:03.276 --> 19:04.211
Sit still.

19:04.244 --> 19:05.678
He's too loud for me.

19:05.712 --> 19:06.979
His volume is at a ten.

19:07.013 --> 19:09.749
He needs to be about a volume
two.

19:09.782 --> 19:10.717
He is a big kid.

19:10.750 --> 19:16.456
He's a 25-year-old boy.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.658
[FARTS]
You can look him dead in the

19:18.691 --> 19:21.661
face and say, Patrick, do not
touch, that an he will look at

19:21.694 --> 19:25.131
you and touch it.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.733
You know, it's like really?

19:26.766 --> 19:30.169
I can't just come out and say,
shut the hell up, just because I

19:30.203 --> 19:33.139
am older, I think they would
want to stick together.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.474
It's very tough for me.

19:34.507 --> 19:37.009
I'm in the a social butterfly.

19:37.043 --> 19:41.281
To be a commercial fisherman,
you work alone.

19:41.314 --> 19:45.218
I don't want to be exploited, so
I'm trying to build a

19:45.252 --> 19:49.121
relationship with Ali, trying to
get on the same page with her.

19:49.155 --> 19:52.191
I just want to see that you
andry on the same page, you know

19:52.225 --> 19:53.393
what I mean?

19:53.426 --> 19:59.198
The more you think about it,
Patrick's going to start wearing

19:59.232 --> 20:00.433
on us after a while.

20:00.467 --> 20:02.101
It's hard to not get short with
him.

20:02.134 --> 20:04.170
Yeah, it definitely is.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.071
It makes me nervous.

20:05.104 --> 20:07.374
Patrick's name is starting to
come up.

20:07.407 --> 20:08.608
It's so early.

20:08.641 --> 20:11.844
How am I supposed to come up if
Patrick is getting on people's

20:11.878 --> 20:12.812
nerves and he's nuts.

20:12.845 --> 20:16.148
He's just so adamant on
everything.

20:16.182 --> 20:18.485
Yeah.

20:18.518 --> 20:21.288
With Patrick, I feel like I'm
babysitting a lot.

20:21.321 --> 20:23.390
I don't want that to be my job.

20:23.423 --> 20:25.258
I'm here to play for me, not
anybody else.

20:25.292 --> 20:28.227
I think I have to definitely
think about where we stand and

20:28.261 --> 20:32.198
how important this relationship
is, because if people decide to

20:32.231 --> 20:34.233
vote Patrick out, I don't think
I need him in this game anymore.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.361
JEFF: All right.

21:01.394 --> 21:03.229
Healers and hustlers getting
your first look at the hero

21:03.262 --> 21:04.130
tribe.

21:04.163 --> 21:05.798
Katrina voted out at first
tribal council.

21:05.832 --> 21:08.901
Chrissy does not know I'm the
one that gave that to her.

21:08.935 --> 21:10.670
I don't know how that first
tribal went.

21:10.703 --> 21:14.140
Maybe she used it and that's why
she's still there, but I hope

21:14.173 --> 21:16.643
she sticks around so I can get
an opportunity to use that

21:16.676 --> 21:19.612
connection down the road.

21:19.646 --> 21:20.680
JEFF: All right.

21:20.713 --> 21:23.650
You guys ready to get to today's
immunity challenge?

21:23.683 --> 21:24.817
Yeah.

21:24.851 --> 21:32.592
JEFF: First things first, I
need to take back the idols.

21:32.625 --> 21:33.426
Thank you.

21:33.460 --> 21:38.264
Thanks, Mike.

21:38.297 --> 21:41.033
Once again immunity is back up
for grabs.

21:41.067 --> 21:43.269
For today's challenge, three
members of each tribe are going

21:43.302 --> 21:45.338
to swim out to a floating net
ring.

21:45.372 --> 21:48.908
You'll then dive down and
maneuver a bundle of puzzle

21:48.941 --> 21:50.610
pieces through a cage.

21:50.643 --> 21:54.080
Once you've collectedded all
three bundles, the two remaining

21:54.113 --> 21:58.818
tribe members will use those
pieces to solve a signpost

21:58.851 --> 22:00.019
puzzle.

22:00.052 --> 22:05.191
First two tribes to finish win
immunity, safe from the vote.

22:05.224 --> 22:07.494
In addition, you're playing for
reward.

22:07.527 --> 22:09.429
Want to know what you're playing
for?

22:09.462 --> 22:10.697
Yes.

22:10.730 --> 22:14.133
JEFF: First tribe the
finish, the ultimate "survivor"

22:14.166 --> 22:14.567
fishing kit.

22:14.601 --> 22:15.768
All right.

22:15.802 --> 22:18.270
JEFF: You've been catching
fish, this will take it to the

22:18.304 --> 22:20.306
next level.

22:20.339 --> 22:24.110
Traps, net, knife, line, lures,
sinkers.

22:24.143 --> 22:28.581
Second tribe to finish, smaller
but still effective, lines,

22:28.615 --> 22:29.749
lures.

22:29.782 --> 22:32.485
Last tribe to finish, nothing
but a date with me at tribal

22:32.519 --> 22:35.855
council where somebody will be
the second person voted out of

22:35.888 --> 22:37.424
this game.

22:37.457 --> 22:38.891
Healers, you have one extra
member.

22:38.925 --> 22:40.059
Going to sit somebody out?

22:40.092 --> 22:41.293
Who is it going to be?

22:41.327 --> 22:42.529
Joe.

22:42.562 --> 22:46.533
JEFF: Joe is going to sit
this one out.

22:46.566 --> 22:51.438
Hustlerring going to sit someone
out, who is it going to be?

22:51.471 --> 22:53.706
Lauren.

22:53.740 --> 22:56.275
Everyone else take a minute to
strategize and we'll get

22:56.308 --> 23:06.152
started.

23:06.185 --> 23:07.219
JEFF: All right.

23:07.253 --> 23:12.825
Here we go for immunity and
reward, survivors ready?

23:12.859 --> 23:16.395
Go!

23:16.429 --> 23:20.132
First you got to swim that life
ring to the buoy.

23:20.166 --> 23:24.537
Then you got to dive down, unto
a bundle of puzzle pieces, and

23:24.571 --> 23:27.907
then maneuver it through the
cage.

23:27.940 --> 23:32.579
Hustlers get there first.

23:32.612 --> 23:34.413
Healers are there.

23:34.447 --> 23:41.854
Heros are there.

23:46.859 --> 23:48.795
Ashley comes up empty handed.

23:48.828 --> 24:00.306
J.P. Down for the heroes.

24:00.339 --> 24:01.541
Devon quickly up for the
hustlers.

24:01.574 --> 24:02.809
Let's go!

24:02.842 --> 24:05.011
Come on, guys.

24:05.044 --> 24:08.447
JEFF: Devon going under
again for the hustlers.

24:08.481 --> 24:11.083
They're out to an early lead.

24:11.117 --> 24:13.352
Paul is up without a bundle.

24:13.385 --> 24:20.092
Now roark in the water for the
healers.

24:20.126 --> 24:21.393
Heroes have their first burn l.

24:21.427 --> 24:26.833
Mice job, guys!

24:26.866 --> 24:30.002
Here comes roark with the first
bundle for the healers.

24:30.036 --> 24:35.107
It is now Jessica going down.

24:35.141 --> 24:37.577
All three tribes now with one
bundle.

24:37.610 --> 24:39.779
Devon back up with the second
bundle.

24:39.812 --> 24:46.385
Hustlers with one bundle left.

24:46.418 --> 24:48.855
J.P. Has a second bundle for the
heroes.

24:48.888 --> 24:52.592
The healers stuck at one right
now.

24:52.625 --> 24:54.761
Jessica comes up empty handed.

24:54.794 --> 25:02.034
Cole going to go back down now
for the healers.

25:02.068 --> 25:07.273
Devon has the third bundle of
puzzle pieces for the hustlers.

25:07.306 --> 25:08.440
Hustlers can head back.

25:08.474 --> 25:13.913
Hustlers with a huge lead right
now.

25:13.946 --> 25:17.584
The healers have their second
bundle.

25:17.617 --> 25:18.450
They've got one left.

25:18.484 --> 25:22.421
Roark going back down.

25:22.454 --> 25:26.325
J.P. Has the third bundle of
puzzle pieces for the heroes.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.227
They can start swimming their
pieces in.

25:28.260 --> 25:30.963
The hustlers with a nice lead.

25:30.997 --> 25:35.301
Got to get everybody up here and
the pieces on the platform.

25:35.334 --> 25:40.339
Healers still looking for that
third bundle.

25:40.372 --> 25:44.143
Healers falling way behind now.

25:44.176 --> 25:47.546
Heroes got to get all your
pieces and everybody on the

25:47.580 --> 25:49.582
platform.

25:49.616 --> 25:51.951
Cole has the third bundle for
the healers.

25:51.984 --> 25:54.420
Healers can now start swimming
in.

25:54.453 --> 25:56.088
Nice work, nice work!

25:56.122 --> 25:58.991
JEFF: Hustlers can start
working on their buzzell.

25:59.025 --> 26:02.061
It is Ali and Simone for the
hustler tribe.

26:02.094 --> 26:03.596
Heroes have all their pieces
free.

26:03.630 --> 26:04.664
They can start solving.

26:04.697 --> 26:08.835
Ali, I'm going to need your
help banging these in.

26:08.868 --> 26:12.271
JEFF: It is now Alan and
Chrissy.

26:12.304 --> 26:17.443
Heroes working to make up some
time lost under water.

26:17.476 --> 26:20.613
Got to get everybody up here and
on the platform with your

26:20.647 --> 26:21.814
pieces.

26:21.848 --> 26:24.717
Your signpost puzzle contains
the names of places survivors

26:24.751 --> 26:25.952
visited over the years.

26:25.985 --> 26:27.954
Hustlers our to an early lead.

26:27.987 --> 26:29.155
Too long.

26:29.188 --> 26:32.291
JEFF: Heroes trying to get
in this and the heroes now can

26:32.324 --> 26:33.259
get in it.

26:33.292 --> 26:35.227
Everyone now working on their
signpost puzzle.

26:35.261 --> 26:39.231
The goal is you want to spin
that so it doesn't hit any of

26:39.265 --> 26:40.066
the obstacles.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.567
As long as that's working,
you're good.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.936
We good, we good, we good.

26:43.970 --> 26:44.270
We good.

26:44.303 --> 26:46.038
Okay.

26:46.072 --> 26:49.308
JEFF: Heroes got to try
something else.

26:49.341 --> 26:50.509
Right here.

26:50.542 --> 26:52.779
Okay, which is the
shorteddest?

26:52.812 --> 26:54.847
JEFF: Healers, that won't
work.

26:54.881 --> 26:56.582
You will have to swap out.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.017
There's a lot of trial and
error.

26:58.050 --> 27:00.486
If it were easy, it would not be
"survivor."

27:00.519 --> 27:02.321
Okay.

27:02.354 --> 27:03.122
Cambodia.

27:03.155 --> 27:05.091
Switch cam benda and
Philippines.

27:05.124 --> 27:07.159
JEFF: The hustler tribe
getting close.

27:07.193 --> 27:08.928
Heroes still trying new
combinations.

27:08.961 --> 27:10.562
They think they're close.

27:10.596 --> 27:13.199
Healers with one piece left.

27:13.232 --> 27:15.201
Hustlers with one piece left.

27:15.234 --> 27:19.706
The question is where does it go
right there, put that there.

27:19.739 --> 27:22.709
JEFF: Simone and Ali hope
they have it.

27:22.742 --> 27:23.575
No, something is not right.

27:23.609 --> 27:25.745
Not there, not there, Simone.

27:25.778 --> 27:26.946
Okay.

27:26.979 --> 27:29.515
JEFF: Simone and Ali have
had a huge head start, but it's

27:29.548 --> 27:30.116
evaporated now.

27:30.149 --> 27:31.017
We're dead even.

27:31.050 --> 27:34.687
Anybody can still pull this out.

27:34.721 --> 27:36.188
Desi, Desi.

27:36.222 --> 27:38.657
Behind you!

27:38.691 --> 27:40.927
JEFF: Hustlers still
working with their last piece.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.862
No, another block.

27:42.895 --> 27:43.830
Something still not right.

27:43.863 --> 27:47.166
Find which pieces need to go
where, Simone.

27:47.199 --> 27:49.268
Cambodia.

27:49.301 --> 27:50.269
Cambodia.

27:50.302 --> 27:51.503
JEFF: Healers now getting
some momentum again.

27:51.537 --> 27:52.671
If they're right...

27:52.705 --> 27:54.640
Keep spinning.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.608
JEFF: Healers think they
have it.

27:56.642 --> 27:58.377
Jeff!

27:58.410 --> 27:59.678
JEFF: They do.

27:59.712 --> 28:05.517
Healers win immunity for the
second time in a row.

28:05.551 --> 28:06.518
Let's go, baby.

28:06.552 --> 28:08.154
JEFF: We're looking for one
more.

28:08.187 --> 28:09.822
Go to go back.

28:09.856 --> 28:12.391
It is now the heroes versus the
hustlers.

28:12.424 --> 28:13.726
Okay.

28:13.760 --> 28:14.260
Anyone?

28:14.293 --> 28:15.194
Which one, which one?

28:15.227 --> 28:17.730
JEFF: All the pressure on
Ali and Simone.

28:17.764 --> 28:19.598
You better be right if you're on
the puzzle.

28:19.631 --> 28:21.133
Put that piece back.

28:21.167 --> 28:21.834
Yeah.

28:21.868 --> 28:23.402
No, it's way too small, guys.

28:23.435 --> 28:24.570
Try it.

28:24.603 --> 28:27.907
JEFF: Patrick yelling out
orders to Ali.

28:27.940 --> 28:28.841
Too long.

28:28.875 --> 28:29.776
JEFF: It's wrong.

28:29.809 --> 28:31.010
Another block.

28:31.043 --> 28:33.679
Get down, Simone.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.882
You just observe, Simone.

28:35.915 --> 28:42.054
JEFF: Heroes trying a new
series of pieces.

28:42.088 --> 28:42.688
Yeah!

28:42.721 --> 28:44.423
JEFF: And they've got it.

28:44.456 --> 28:47.693
Heroes win immunity and reward,
sending the hustlers to tribal

28:47.726 --> 28:56.936
council.

28:56.969 --> 28:59.138
Healer tribe, who wants to come
get it?

28:59.171 --> 29:02.875
There we go, Cole.

29:02.909 --> 29:04.243
JEFF: Nice job.

29:04.276 --> 29:07.146
Nobody going home once again
from the healer tribe.

29:07.179 --> 29:11.050
And a big fishing reward will be
waiting for you back at camp.

29:11.083 --> 29:13.519
Yay!

29:13.552 --> 29:15.487
JEFF: Hero tribe, somebody
come get it.

29:15.521 --> 29:16.622
Yeah.

29:16.655 --> 29:17.389
I'm on it.

29:17.423 --> 29:21.794
I'm on it.

29:21.828 --> 29:24.063
JEFF: Nice job, hero tribe.

29:24.096 --> 29:25.297
Nobody going home tonight.

29:25.331 --> 29:28.534
And a smaller but still useful
fishing kit will be waiting for

29:28.567 --> 29:31.804
you back at camp.

29:31.838 --> 29:33.039
Hustlers, you know the drill.

29:33.072 --> 29:35.374
Tribal council where somebody
will be the second person voted

29:35.407 --> 29:36.876
out of "survivor."

29:36.909 --> 29:38.811
Head back to camp, swim on out.

29:38.845 --> 29:45.184
In my mind, Simone is our
least-valuable member.

29:45.217 --> 29:47.119
She doesn't fit in with all of
us.

29:47.153 --> 29:49.288
We saw today she can't do
puzzles.

29:49.321 --> 29:51.323
It's a bummer, by Simone's got
to go.

30:18.817 --> 30:19.218
We played hard.

30:19.251 --> 30:20.452
Oh, man.

30:20.486 --> 30:23.622
I can just say, I'm really
sorry, like we had a lead and I

30:23.655 --> 30:26.058
wish I had been more dominant in
the puzzle.

30:26.092 --> 30:29.761
We all wanted it so much, like
it's the worst thing that could

30:29.795 --> 30:33.799
have happened.

30:33.832 --> 30:35.868
And we're in the middle of
connecting with everybody,

30:35.902 --> 30:39.538
bonding with everybody, and to
have to remove one of us, it

30:39.571 --> 30:41.240
just makes me feel sick.

30:41.273 --> 30:44.310
As far as challenges, it
obviously stands out that I'm

30:44.343 --> 30:47.813
not one of the strongest people
here, so I think I would be an

30:47.846 --> 30:50.983
so what I need to do is start
shaping the narrative of the

30:51.017 --> 30:52.151
tribe.

30:52.184 --> 30:55.854
Clearly Patrick is getting on
Lauren's nerves, and that's

30:55.888 --> 30:58.324
going to play to my advantage.

30:58.357 --> 31:01.693
It is very easy for people to
have opinions about Patrick,

31:01.727 --> 31:08.134
which makes it very easy to
shape the narrative around him.

31:08.167 --> 31:11.303
Honestly I don't want to out
pat, but I notice you and

31:11.337 --> 31:13.839
Patrick are butting heads.

31:13.872 --> 31:15.107
I know it sucks to talk about...

31:15.141 --> 31:17.809
Patrick is earning my nerves.

31:17.843 --> 31:20.512
He's only energetic when it's
something concerning him.

31:20.546 --> 31:21.647
I feel the same way.

31:21.680 --> 31:23.415
So you must worry about him.

31:23.449 --> 31:24.616
Right.

31:24.650 --> 31:27.920
We could probably convince maybe
either Ryan or Devon to vote

31:27.954 --> 31:28.554
with us.

31:28.587 --> 31:30.289
Patrick is unpredictable.

31:30.322 --> 31:33.392
I don't trust him, and he
doesn't follow directions.

31:33.425 --> 31:34.626
So he could hurt us.

31:34.660 --> 31:37.896
You know, even though he's
strong, strong isn't always what

31:37.930 --> 31:39.065
you need.

31:39.098 --> 31:42.468
Simone's not that great at
challenges, but Simone at least

31:42.501 --> 31:43.669
listens.

31:43.702 --> 31:47.373
We got to get back over there so
they don't trip out.

31:47.406 --> 31:47.806
So Patrick.

31:47.839 --> 31:48.574
All right.

31:48.607 --> 31:50.409
It's not going to be one of
us.

31:50.442 --> 31:51.743
I hope not.

31:51.777 --> 31:53.745
It's not.

31:53.779 --> 31:54.046
It's Simone.

31:54.080 --> 31:54.981
Yeah.

31:55.014 --> 31:56.182
Exactly.

31:56.215 --> 31:58.184
Tonight at tribal council,
Simone is going to be the one

31:58.217 --> 31:59.251
going home.

31:59.285 --> 32:02.554
I have not seen her in any way
helping us as a tribe.

32:02.588 --> 32:05.324
It seems like everybody else is
on the same page with me.

32:05.357 --> 32:08.460
The boys are already together,
and Ali's on my side, so I've

32:08.494 --> 32:09.528
got a majority here.

32:09.561 --> 32:12.031
I think this tribe will be
definitely better without

32:12.064 --> 32:14.066
Simone.

32:14.100 --> 32:16.002
Simone's the first one.

32:16.035 --> 32:16.635
Yeah.

32:16.668 --> 32:17.636
I hope that's all right.

32:17.669 --> 32:18.971
No, yeah.

32:19.005 --> 32:20.039
Of course.

32:20.072 --> 32:22.008
I'd rather be on the majority,
right?

32:22.041 --> 32:23.542
Yeah.

32:23.575 --> 32:24.543
We're on the majority.

32:24.576 --> 32:27.179
Going into tonight, I
definitely have options.

32:27.213 --> 32:30.449
You know, I know Simone will
listen to me and I know she

32:30.482 --> 32:33.052
would follow me, but me and pat
have been together since day

32:33.085 --> 32:34.220
one.

32:34.253 --> 32:36.488
He looks at me and I can tell
that he trusts me more than

32:36.522 --> 32:37.589
anyone else in this game.

32:37.623 --> 32:39.725
I'm excited going for it.

32:39.758 --> 32:40.892
Me too.

32:40.926 --> 32:43.362
My only concern is people
aren't sure about Patrick for

32:43.395 --> 32:44.396
the long haul.

32:44.430 --> 32:46.765
I think everybody knows he's way
too unpredictable.

32:46.798 --> 32:48.300
They never know what he's going
to do.

32:48.334 --> 32:52.071
So gun to my head right now
I'd probably say Simone.

32:52.104 --> 32:55.241
Yeah, but she said pat's
name.

32:55.274 --> 32:56.542
Oh, my god.

32:56.575 --> 32:59.978
If we vote out pat, we'll
probably lose every single time.

33:00.012 --> 33:05.551
Well, right now I feel like
we have Simone eating out of our

33:05.584 --> 33:06.152
hands.

33:06.185 --> 33:07.253
What are you thinking?

33:07.286 --> 33:09.488
Do we keep her around because
she's someone that...

33:09.521 --> 33:11.523
Right, right.

33:11.557 --> 33:12.791
Is easy to control?

33:12.824 --> 33:15.094
That's a very good point.

33:15.127 --> 33:16.695
Because pat is unpredictable.

33:16.728 --> 33:17.929
I know.

33:17.963 --> 33:22.000
So if we have the three, with
me, you and Devon, we're golden.

33:22.034 --> 33:25.104
We could easily survive.

33:25.137 --> 33:26.772
If we have us three, that's all
we need.

33:26.805 --> 33:27.473
Yeah.

33:27.506 --> 33:29.241
Because three is a majority.

33:29.275 --> 33:34.513
Initially I kind of wanted
Simone out, but it's a lot of

33:34.546 --> 33:36.515
uncertainty with Patrick.

33:36.548 --> 33:39.518
It's like you got a newborn
baby, like you really want the

33:39.551 --> 33:43.255
like it, take care of it, but
it's really, really annoying

33:43.289 --> 33:46.392
because you have to watch it
every single second.

33:46.425 --> 33:49.528
He's really good around camp and
he's great in challenge, as

33:49.561 --> 33:52.898
well, but he's unpredictability,
and predictability is the best

33:52.931 --> 33:55.000
thing I can have in an alliance
member.

33:55.033 --> 33:56.802
That's why I like Devon so much.

33:56.835 --> 34:01.307
As long as we get out of this
hellhole, perfect.

34:01.340 --> 34:02.408
Yeah.

34:02.441 --> 34:05.944
But it's not like I'm
dragging along a elementing in

34:05.977 --> 34:06.412
Simone.

34:06.445 --> 34:07.546
She scares me.

34:07.579 --> 34:07.979
She's really smart.

34:08.013 --> 34:08.847
We're good?

34:08.880 --> 34:12.251
We're good.

34:12.284 --> 34:13.351
For sure.

34:13.385 --> 34:16.688
I want to be aligned with
predictable people who are

34:16.722 --> 34:18.224
socially good and want to listen
to me.

34:18.257 --> 34:20.826
Tonight is about who can we
trust more going forward, and

34:20.859 --> 34:23.462
who is going to be the most
loyal?

34:23.495 --> 34:26.197
It's really scary, but you got
to put your trust in people in

34:26.232 --> 34:28.699
this game because in a
six-person tribe, there is no

34:28.734 --> 34:34.505
place to hide.

34:55.460 --> 34:58.164
JEFF: Behind each of you is
a torch.

34:58.197 --> 35:04.002
Go ahead, grab a torch, approach
a flame, dip it in and get fire.

35:04.035 --> 35:07.072
This is part of the ritual of
tribal council, because in this

35:07.105 --> 35:09.375
game, fire represents your life.

35:09.408 --> 35:12.144
When your fire is gone, so are
you.

35:12.178 --> 35:13.279
All right.

35:13.312 --> 35:16.748
Ryan, six days in, what's the
vibe of the hustler tribe?

35:16.782 --> 35:18.917
Obviously we're sad that we
lost today.

35:18.950 --> 35:20.118
It was a tough challenge.

35:20.152 --> 35:23.889
But we've been in it a lot of
the time, and we've bonded so

35:23.922 --> 35:25.090
well together.

35:25.123 --> 35:27.459
I feel like it's a birthday
party that your mom makes you go

35:27.493 --> 35:30.729
to, and you don't like the kid
whose birthday party it, is and

35:30.762 --> 35:32.398
we don't want to go to it.

35:32.431 --> 35:34.400
We all love each other.

35:34.433 --> 35:37.102
JEFF: Oh, tribal is the
birthday party for the kid you

35:37.135 --> 35:38.370
don't like.

35:38.404 --> 35:41.340
But I want the keep everybody
that's going to the party, but I

35:41.373 --> 35:43.409
don't think that's going to
happen.

35:43.442 --> 35:44.310
[LAUGHTER]
JEFF: Lauren, that's a

35:44.343 --> 35:46.378
really interesting observation.

35:46.412 --> 35:48.714
For me it's not a birthday
party.

35:48.747 --> 35:50.382
It's more like a funeral.

35:50.416 --> 35:52.083
Hustlers usually work alone.

35:52.117 --> 35:53.452
We're the oddest group of
people.

35:53.485 --> 35:56.855
I thought I was going to have a
problem coming in and hanging

35:56.888 --> 35:59.425
out, but we are capable of
working together if there is

35:59.458 --> 36:02.494
enough communication, so I hope
it continues to work and I hope

36:02.528 --> 36:05.697
we don't get seen for a long
time after tonight.

36:05.731 --> 36:08.434
JEFF: Ali, I'm getting a
sense from this group that

36:08.467 --> 36:10.669
harmony is what's going to make
you really gel.

36:10.702 --> 36:12.471
So does that make tonight's vote
difficult?

36:12.504 --> 36:13.705
Yeah.

36:13.739 --> 36:16.041
Not only thinking as a tribe,
but thinking personally, I have

36:16.074 --> 36:19.211
the think, how is this person
that either goes or stays going

36:19.245 --> 36:22.548
to benefit me and my tribe.

36:22.581 --> 36:25.116
This game changes so rapidly,
and you have to have people you

36:25.150 --> 36:27.819
can trust and people that are on
your side that you know you can

36:27.853 --> 36:29.821
go to them, you know, when
necessary.

36:29.855 --> 36:33.325
JEFF: Patrick, Ali makes a
really good point.

36:33.359 --> 36:36.295
Every person you vote out
impacts the tribe, but they also

36:36.328 --> 36:37.396
impact your game.

36:37.429 --> 36:42.634
Yes, we've come to this sad
birthday party, and it's

36:42.668 --> 36:45.136
definitely impacting the way I
want to vote and who I am going

36:45.170 --> 36:46.272
to vote out.

36:46.305 --> 36:49.007
I want to keep our tribe the
strongest and keep our tribe

36:49.040 --> 36:51.042
moving forward at its best pace.

36:51.076 --> 36:54.246
JEFF: Ryan, every vote
matters, not only in harmony,

36:54.280 --> 36:56.548
but also in terms of strategy.

36:56.582 --> 36:59.585
Because everybody here is
already looking down the line.

36:59.618 --> 37:02.654
First of all there are a lot
of facets.

37:02.688 --> 37:05.924
You can focus on physicality,
short term win the challenges.

37:05.957 --> 37:09.328
You can say, we need to focus on
social dynamics and try the

37:09.361 --> 37:10.796
build trust into something
strategic.

37:10.829 --> 37:13.665
There are sick different agendas
up here, but everybody thinks

37:13.699 --> 37:14.800
there is just one plan.

37:14.833 --> 37:19.204
JEFF: Simone, what will the
vote be based on for you?

37:19.237 --> 37:22.708
If we were playing ole-school
survivor, it is always how did

37:22.741 --> 37:25.677
the challenge go, but I think it
has more to go with building up

37:25.711 --> 37:28.480
a body of people you trust and
understanding your relationship

37:28.514 --> 37:32.584
with them and building a solid
foundation so you can move

37:32.618 --> 37:33.752
together.

37:33.785 --> 37:36.322
JEFF: Ali, those are the
kind of words said by somebody

37:36.355 --> 37:39.325
that if they're true could be an
alliance partner that goes deep.

37:39.358 --> 37:40.659
Yeah, I think so.

37:40.692 --> 37:43.695
I mean, once we vote, we're
going to find out exactly where

37:43.729 --> 37:44.930
we stand.

37:44.963 --> 37:47.433
So strategically someone like
this that wants to stay tight is

37:47.466 --> 37:49.901
going to be beneficial, of
course.

37:49.935 --> 37:52.671
JEFF: Patrick, how
important is trust to you right

37:52.704 --> 37:53.672
now in this group?

37:53.705 --> 37:55.741
Having trust is huge.

37:55.774 --> 38:04.683
And I feel like I can trust most
of the people here.

38:04.716 --> 38:05.317
JEFF: Most.

38:05.351 --> 38:06.452
He didn't say all.

38:06.485 --> 38:07.586
He did not.

38:07.619 --> 38:09.888
Sorry, Jeff, I meant to say
all.

38:09.921 --> 38:10.622
JEFF: Wow.

38:10.656 --> 38:12.791
That got a big reaction,
Patrick.

38:12.824 --> 38:13.959
It did.

38:13.992 --> 38:16.261
It was a slip of words.

38:16.294 --> 38:17.396
I'm talking too fast.

38:17.429 --> 38:19.197
They shouldn't have come out.

38:19.230 --> 38:23.369
I'm going to say I trust all of
our members.

38:23.402 --> 38:24.670
I'm sold.

38:24.703 --> 38:27.339
Yeah, me too.

38:27.373 --> 38:30.075
That's it.

38:30.108 --> 38:34.279
JEFF: Lauren, while Patrick
jokes, the truth is what comes

38:34.312 --> 38:36.281
out out here is usually a lot
more authentic.

38:36.314 --> 38:37.449
I agree with that.

38:37.483 --> 38:38.384
This is very real.

38:38.417 --> 38:40.419
I mean, if you mean all, say
all.

38:40.452 --> 38:41.920
If you mean most, say most.

38:41.953 --> 38:43.154
This is a game.

38:43.188 --> 38:46.291
JEFF: Patrick, if I can put
a heart monitor on you, how many

38:46.324 --> 38:47.158
beats per minute right now?

38:47.192 --> 38:48.093
A lot.

38:48.126 --> 38:50.796
I would guess about 180.

38:50.829 --> 38:54.833
I think that's way faster than
normal.

38:54.866 --> 38:57.035
Jeff, you know, I am nervous
right now.

38:57.068 --> 38:59.805
It makes my stomach
uncomfortable thinking that

38:59.838 --> 39:02.641
anybody could want to vote home
the only redhead on the time.

39:02.674 --> 39:04.376
JEFF: And yet, it's
possible.

39:04.410 --> 39:09.080
Jeff, I would say I'm one of
the most trustworthy people you

39:09.114 --> 39:09.948
can know.

39:09.981 --> 39:11.216
The last thing I want is me
going home.

39:11.249 --> 39:13.084
I want to be here on the last
day with you.

39:13.118 --> 39:15.153
JEFF: How many of you were
listening to that answer

39:15.186 --> 39:17.856
thinking, oh, god, I hope it's
not me tonight, because that's

39:17.889 --> 39:18.390
how I feel?

39:18.424 --> 39:19.224
Yeah.

39:19.257 --> 39:19.725
JEFF: Everybody.

39:19.758 --> 39:20.792
Big time.

39:20.826 --> 39:23.028
DREW: Ryan, if it's you
tonight, six day, is that

39:23.061 --> 39:23.795
enough?

39:23.829 --> 39:27.298
Everybody leaves so much
here.

39:27.332 --> 39:30.802
I'd be gutted if I went home
early, because your story is

39:30.836 --> 39:35.541
just chopped, and you only have
such a short time period to look

39:35.574 --> 39:39.545
back fondly upon when you know
that the game continued without

39:39.578 --> 39:40.546
you.

39:40.579 --> 39:42.047
JEFF: Simone, if it's you,
not what you want?

39:42.080 --> 39:44.983
I agree.

39:45.016 --> 39:46.752
This is 100% real.

39:46.785 --> 39:47.986
This struggle is so different.

39:48.019 --> 39:49.354
I come from a city.

39:49.387 --> 39:50.756
I've never been camping before.

39:50.789 --> 39:54.359
I'm terrified 100% of the time.

39:54.392 --> 39:57.095
But the good thing about being a
hustler is you challenge

39:57.128 --> 39:57.929
yourself.

39:57.963 --> 39:59.297
So send me back to the bugs.

39:59.330 --> 40:04.470
I don't want to go home.

40:04.503 --> 40:05.737
JEFF: All right.

40:05.771 --> 40:06.872
Time to vote.

40:06.905 --> 40:08.907
Simone, you're up.

40:37.435 --> 40:44.409
JEFF: I'll go tally the
votes.

40:44.442 --> 40:47.679
If anybody has a hidden immunity
idol and you want the play it,

40:47.713 --> 40:51.650
now would be the time to do so.

40:51.683 --> 40:52.618
Okay.

40:52.651 --> 40:54.385
Once the votes are read, the
decision is final.

40:54.419 --> 40:57.623
Person voted out will be asked
to leave the tribal council area

40:57.656 --> 40:58.289
immediately.

40:58.323 --> 40:59.424
I'll read the votes.

40:59.457 --> 41:03.829
First vote Patrick.

41:03.862 --> 41:06.998
Simone.

41:07.032 --> 41:07.465
Simone.

41:07.499 --> 41:11.236
Two votes Simone.

41:11.269 --> 41:11.737
Simone.

41:11.770 --> 41:12.704
Three votes Simone.

41:12.738 --> 41:16.842
One vote Patrick.

41:16.875 --> 41:19.377
Second person voted out of
"survivor," Simone.

41:19.410 --> 41:22.180
That's four, that's enough, you
need to bring me your torch.

41:22.213 --> 41:24.716
Okay.

41:24.750 --> 41:25.450
I know.

41:25.483 --> 41:33.992
I know.

41:34.025 --> 41:38.396
JEFF: Simone, the tribe has
spoken.

41:38.429 --> 41:39.164
Time for you to go.

41:39.197 --> 41:46.838
Bye.

41:46.872 --> 41:50.175
JEFF: Well, the bad news is
you lost a tribe member.

41:50.208 --> 41:52.310
The good news is, you're the
hustler tribe.

41:52.343 --> 41:54.312
When you get knocked down, you
get back up.
