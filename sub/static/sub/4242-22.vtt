to prepare for.

01:05.510 --> 01:06.844
Our work here is done,

01:06.929 --> 01:08.846
so there's only one thing
left to do:

01:08.931 --> 01:09.931
Say goodbye.

01:09.998 --> 01:12.016
Underclassmen, pick some songs

01:12.101 --> 01:13.301
to say goodbye to the seniors;

01:13.352 --> 01:15.770
seniors, pick a song to say
goodbye to us.

for the toilet,

01:20.726 --> 01:22.393

Joe for the food,

01:22.478 --> 01:23.278

the shortest,

01:23.345 --> 01:24.812

came, didn't it?

04:11.530 --> 04:12.530
Not yet.

04:12.614 --> 04:13.614
Sit down.
I want to give you

04:13.682 --> 04:14.565
your graduation present.

04:14.650 --> 04:15.683
Is Elaine Stritch here?

04:15.751 --> 04:17.067
I don't know who that is.

04:17.136 --> 04:19.620
See, this is the problem
with getting you gifts--

04:19.688 --> 04:21.856
I can't make heads or tails
about what it is your like.

04:21.906 --> 04:23.541
Dad, I'm easy.

04:23.609 --> 04:25.877
<i>Just get me something from Tom
Ford's Vanities in Vanity Fair.</i>

04:25.961 --> 04:27.562
Good to know.

04:27.629 --> 04:30.665
So... somewhere around
your seventh birthday,

04:30.716 --> 04:32.800
I lost you.

04:32.868 --> 04:34.669
Before that,
you were a normal kid.

04:34.720 --> 04:36.471
I mean, a kid who
liked to dust, but...

04:36.538 --> 04:38.806
You know, I read you to bed,

04:38.874 --> 04:42.209
I put cartoons on TV
when you were bored.

04:42.261 --> 04:43.811
I taught you how
to ride a bike...

04:43.879 --> 04:44.879
the normal stuff.

04:44.930 --> 04:48.232
And then you turned
seven or eight,

04:48.317 --> 04:51.185
and you start to become this.

04:51.236 --> 04:54.572
And, uh, it was like I was
living with an alien.

04:54.656 --> 04:57.825
I mean, I tried to keep up,
but, uh, you know,

04:57.893 --> 04:59.410
once your mom passed, I...
I really...

04:59.495 --> 05:00.745
I didn't stand a chance.

05:00.829 --> 05:02.246
You did good, Dad.

05:02.331 --> 05:05.666
I am proud of what you and I
did together.

05:05.734 --> 05:06.667
I'm proud of us, too.

05:06.735 --> 05:07.785
Do you remember when it started?

05:07.870 --> 05:10.121
When we turned a corner

05:10.205 --> 05:12.373
and started walking
towards each other,

05:12.424 --> 05:14.008
rather than in opposite
directions?

05:14.075 --> 05:15.259
Tell me.

05:15.344 --> 05:16.544
Aw, screw that,
I'm gonna show you.

05:16.595 --> 05:20.848
It was in the basement
of our old house.

05:20.916 --> 05:22.633
You were wearing
a unitard.

05:22.718 --> 05:25.186

don't do this--

10:16.544 --> 10:18.429
And, like,
totally terrifying.

10:18.513 --> 10:19.480
We need to make a pact.

10:19.547 --> 10:20.481
When we get our letters,

10:20.548 --> 10:21.398
we open them together,

10:21.483 --> 10:22.817
in the choir room.

10:22.884 --> 10:25.186
These letters, you know,
they're, like our future

10:25.237 --> 10:26.487
so I want to open mine

10:26.554 --> 10:28.022
with my two most
important people.

10:28.073 --> 10:29.690
Deal?
Deal.

10:29.741 --> 10:31.158
Deal.

10:31.226 --> 10:32.059
Pinkie swear?

10:32.110 --> 10:32.776
Yeah.

10:32.861 --> 10:33.727
All right.

10:35.767 --> 10:35.767
+

10:37.827 --> 10:39.278
(school bell rings)

10:41.698 --> 10:42.814
What is this crap?
Oh, didn't you hear?

10:42.866 --> 10:44.416
Mercedes got a
recording contract.

10:44.483 --> 10:45.701
She's moving to Hollywood
and she's going to be

10:45.785 --> 10:47.002
a superstar by Christmas,
guaranteed.

10:47.086 --> 10:48.170
MERCEDES:
He's exaggerating.

10:48.254 --> 10:49.788
You remember that video that

10:49.839 --> 10:52.090
he posted of me on YouTube,
singing "Disco Inferno"?

10:52.158 --> 10:53.125
Well, this music producer
in L.A. saw it

10:53.176 --> 10:54.326
and he wants to sign her.

10:54.377 --> 10:56.211
As a backup singer
on an indie label.

10:56.296 --> 10:59.097
I'm going to be taking
extension classes at UCLA.

10:59.165 --> 11:02.134
If this was happening
to anyone else, I would be

11:02.185 --> 11:03.302
extremely jealous.

11:03.353 --> 11:05.637
This is really cool.

11:05.688 --> 11:07.606
Congratulations.
Thank you.

11:07.673 --> 11:08.974
(grunts)

11:09.025 --> 11:10.675
And I couldn't have done it
without you.

11:10.727 --> 11:13.695
Oh, did you hear
about Mike?

11:13.780 --> 11:16.231
I was all set to go
to Alvin Ailey,

11:16.316 --> 11:19.201
and then Joffrey in Chicago
offered me a scholarship.

11:19.285 --> 11:21.453
Oh, Mike, that's amazing.

11:21.520 --> 11:23.355
Congratulations.

11:23.406 --> 11:25.523
You must be so excited
to ditch that Cheerios! uniform

11:25.575 --> 11:27.292
and put on the one
for University of Louisville.

11:27.360 --> 11:29.578
Yeah, I... I can't wait.

11:29.662 --> 11:31.747
<i>SANTANA:
This is embarrassing.</i>

11:31.831 --> 11:35.801
<i>I'm a star, so what am I doing
heading to Kentucky?</i>

11:35.868 --> 11:38.003
<i>I'm just as talented
as Mercedes,</i>

11:38.054 --> 11:39.972
<i>Boy Chang, Berry
or Lady Hummel.</i>

11:40.039 --> 11:41.723
<i>Thank God for Mom.</i>

11:41.808 --> 11:44.176
<i>She'll know what to do.</i>

11:44.227 --> 11:47.596
<i>When Santana finally said,
"Mami, papi, I'm gay,"</i>

11:47.680 --> 11:49.564
all I could
think of was,

11:49.649 --> 11:51.099
I should have known.

11:51.184 --> 11:53.151
When she was eight,
she went trick-or-treating

11:53.219 --> 11:55.053
<i>as Uncle Jesse on Full House.</i>

11:55.104 --> 11:57.689
Spent two years
growing out that hair.

11:57.740 --> 11:59.224
"Business in the front..."

11:59.275 --> 12:01.226
BOTH:
"Party in the back."
Ew.

12:01.277 --> 12:03.028
So, you just really didn't care?

12:03.079 --> 12:04.579
I care that my baby's happy.

12:04.664 --> 12:06.865
<i>I wish abuela
felt the same.
I know.</i>

12:06.916 --> 12:08.066
<i>It sucks, mija.</i>

12:08.117 --> 12:09.334
But you don't want a
person in your life

12:09.402 --> 12:10.419
that doesn't support
your dreams.

12:12.005 --> 12:13.789
I don't want to go
to that cheerleading program

12:13.873 --> 12:15.123
at the University of Louisville.

12:15.208 --> 12:16.508
I want to go to New York.

12:16.575 --> 12:18.126
Go to college, Santana.

12:18.211 --> 12:20.128
Do what I never
got the chance to do.

12:20.213 --> 12:22.130
New York will
still be there

12:22.215 --> 12:24.049
after you've earned
your college degree.

12:24.100 --> 12:27.302
Brittany, I understand you
got into Purdue University?

12:27.387 --> 12:29.054
Not the university;
the poultry farm.

12:29.105 --> 12:30.973
Plucker is a steady profession.

12:31.057 --> 12:33.025
But I can't go to either
'cause I'm not graduating.

12:33.092 --> 12:34.142
What?
Yeah.

12:34.227 --> 12:35.477
I was kind of glad

12:35.561 --> 12:37.112
when I found out
that I was flunking

12:37.196 --> 12:38.263
because it'll give me a chance

12:38.314 --> 12:39.597
to do my senior year
all over again.

12:39.649 --> 12:41.650
And way better. I'll show up
to my classes this time.

12:41.734 --> 12:43.785
Plus, I'll get to be a two-term
senior class president.

12:43.870 --> 12:45.437
Why are you pretending
that this is okay?

12:45.488 --> 12:47.155
And why didn't you tell me?

12:47.240 --> 12:49.157
What did you think
was going to happen to me?

12:49.242 --> 12:51.710
I have a 0.0
grade point average.

12:51.777 --> 12:53.945
Well, maybe if Brittany's
staying in Lima,

12:53.997 --> 12:55.613
then I should stay, too.

13:01.087 --> 13:03.505
And now the seniors of McKinley
High School, class of 2012,

13:03.589 --> 13:05.390
are going to sing for you.

13:05.458 --> 13:07.759
This is your glee club.
Take care of it.

13:07.810 --> 13:09.311
It'll take care of you.

13:09.395 --> 13:11.629
One! Two!

13:11.681 --> 13:13.565
One, two, three, yeah!

I don't know. I mean, when
you're looking at both of them,

15:38.461 --> 15:40.278
it's really hard to not just
want to go with the Chiavari.

15:40.329 --> 15:42.831
There's $20 difference
between each of those chairs.

15:42.915 --> 15:45.133
That's, like, hundreds
of dollars or something.

15:45.218 --> 15:46.668
We can't afford that.

15:46.752 --> 15:49.387
Look, I compromised on the food,
I compromised on the location,

15:49.455 --> 15:50.722
I compromised
on the flowers.

15:50.789 --> 15:52.307
Does my butt
really have to compromise

15:52.391 --> 15:53.625
on what it sits on?

15:53.676 --> 15:54.959
Maybe what you're
really upset about

15:55.011 --> 15:56.228
is that you're compromising
on your husband.

15:56.295 --> 15:57.512
Please, that
is the one thing

15:57.597 --> 15:58.847
that I don't have
any doubts about.

15:58.931 --> 16:00.515
Really?

16:00.600 --> 16:02.517
'Cause you've been kind of
giving me a weird vibe lately.

16:02.602 --> 16:04.519
No.

16:06.522 --> 16:07.822
You're just projecting,
all right?

16:07.907 --> 16:09.307
You're nervous about
finding out about school,

16:09.358 --> 16:10.642
and you're
putting it on me.

16:10.693 --> 16:12.477
Besides, when
did you become

16:12.528 --> 16:14.246
the one that I
was settling for?

16:14.313 --> 16:18.033
Look, I don't care who
gets in where, all right?

16:18.117 --> 16:21.169
I'm marrying you, and
nothing makes me happier.

16:21.254 --> 16:25.006
Even if we have to sit in
these ugly fold-out chairs.

16:26.459 --> 16:27.825
Okay?

16:27.877 --> 16:29.327
Okay.

16:38.280 --> 16:40.064
<i>It wasn't the past
I was scared of.</i>

16:40.115 --> 16:42.150
<i>I'd call my high school career

16:42.234 --> 16:44.101
<i>I mean, not in terms
of grades and stuff,</i>

16:44.153 --> 16:45.770
<i>but I won a state title

You're Finn Hudson, and
you want to be an actor.

17:10.479 --> 17:12.012
I was very moved

17:12.097 --> 17:13.598
by your letter
and application, Finn.

17:13.648 --> 17:15.516
You're no doubt aware
that you would be

17:15.601 --> 17:18.269
an exceptional case,
should we accept you.

17:18.319 --> 17:20.154
Yes.

17:20.239 --> 17:21.489
Why don't we start
with your, uh,

17:21.574 --> 17:22.807
dramatic monologue?

17:22.858 --> 17:24.909
Okay.

17:24.977 --> 17:27.829
<i>Yep, fear is no longer

17:30.532 --> 17:32.700
Hey. Just finishing up.

17:32.785 --> 17:34.669
Lay it on me.

17:34.753 --> 17:36.170
"Dear Finn, great knowing you.

17:36.255 --> 17:37.822
Will Schuester."
Are you kidding me?

17:37.873 --> 17:40.041
I'm, like, the best
man at your wedding.
It's not that bad.

17:40.125 --> 17:42.326
And you can't dictate
what I write in your yearbook.

17:42.378 --> 17:44.095
Yes, I can. I want a
little emotion in there.

17:44.162 --> 17:45.380
Some "son I never had"

17:45.464 --> 17:46.547
or "little brother" garbage
or something.

17:46.632 --> 17:48.099
Look, I-I wanted to. I...

17:48.166 --> 17:50.051
I started ten times,
and I couldn't get

17:50.135 --> 17:52.053
two words out
without falling apart.

17:52.137 --> 17:54.555
Well, I don't need a bunch
of "blah, blah" in a book

17:54.640 --> 17:55.840
to remember you anyway.

18:03.065 --> 18:04.899
Finn, wait.

18:04.967 --> 18:06.634
I-I need to tell you something.

18:06.702 --> 18:08.569
Something I would rather
not have

18:08.654 --> 18:09.954
written down anywhere.

18:10.022 --> 18:11.289
Please, have a seat.

18:11.356 --> 18:13.791
Um, when I first

18:13.859 --> 18:16.244
took over the glee club,
we needed a male lead.

18:16.328 --> 18:18.746
I heard you singing in
the shower in the locker room.

were really good.

18:28.474 --> 18:30.091
So I planted the pot
in your locker

18:30.175 --> 18:31.809
and blackmailed you
into joining the glee club.

18:31.877 --> 18:33.094
It was wrong.

18:33.162 --> 18:35.146
Although I can't argue
with the results,

18:35.213 --> 18:37.715
I've always hated myself
for doing it.

18:39.568 --> 18:40.818
I'm very sorry, Finn.

18:40.886 --> 18:42.720
But I-I wanted you
to know the truth

18:42.771 --> 18:44.555
before you left, so...

18:46.692 --> 18:49.727

CAROLE: Your graduation gown
with the extra long sleeves

19:00.622 --> 19:02.256
just arrived.

19:04.126 --> 19:05.893
You know, you can have
that thing if you want.

19:05.961 --> 19:07.061
It's probably
the only thing that'll fit

19:07.129 --> 19:09.063
in your tiny little
New York apartment,

19:09.131 --> 19:10.832
but it's yours to have.

19:10.899 --> 19:12.333
I can't help thinking
I let him down, you know?

19:12.401 --> 19:14.002
I feel like I-I could
have spent more time

19:14.069 --> 19:15.436
writing that letter to the Army,

19:15.504 --> 19:17.772
or I could have wrote 50 letters
to the Army,

19:17.840 --> 19:20.208
or I could have started
one of those

19:20.275 --> 19:22.543
letter-writing campaigns,
like... like they had

19:22.611 --> 19:24.312
<i>for Friday Night Lights
or something.</i>

19:24.380 --> 19:25.847
You did everything
you could do.

19:25.914 --> 19:27.749
Your dad made his choices,
and the Army has rules,

19:27.816 --> 19:29.550
and there's nothing
you could have done

19:29.618 --> 19:30.985
about either one
of those things.

19:31.053 --> 19:33.121
I can't help feeling
like something's not right.

19:33.188 --> 19:34.489
I did a lot
of reseah,

19:34.556 --> 19:36.224
trying to get that
honorable discharge status,

19:36.291 --> 19:37.859
and-and he did a lot

19:37.926 --> 19:39.527
of really great things
in Kuwait, you know?

19:39.595 --> 19:42.430
He pulled two soldiers
out of a burning truck.

19:42.498 --> 19:43.831
He saved their lives.

19:43.899 --> 19:45.233
They have kids now my age.

19:45.300 --> 19:46.601
He's a hero.

19:46.668 --> 19:48.903
And how is becoming an actor...

19:48.971 --> 19:51.506
how is that redemption
for a man who did all that?

19:55.110 --> 19:56.978
(sighs)

19:59.415 --> 20:03.384
Everything seems
like it's fallen into place.

20:03.452 --> 20:05.286
Everything but him.

20:06.855 --> 20:08.122
Okay, seniors, the underclassmen

20:08.190 --> 20:09.690
have something
they'd like to say to you.

20:09.758 --> 20:11.459
Come on.

20:13.095 --> 20:14.896
ARTIE: With all
the dedications

20:14.963 --> 20:16.431
being thrown
around McKinley this week,

20:16.498 --> 20:18.616
there was one that we wanted
to make sure didn't get missed.

20:18.667 --> 20:19.834
Finn.

20:21.453 --> 20:22.987
Right now, you're something
I never thought possible

20:23.038 --> 20:24.288
when I first rolled
down these halls.

20:24.339 --> 20:26.490
You're my friend-- our friend.

20:26.542 --> 20:29.260
Even before Glee Club was
kind of cool, you had our backs.

20:29.327 --> 20:30.495
You were on the
football team.

20:30.562 --> 20:31.712
You were one
of the most

20:31.797 --> 20:33.164
popular kids in school.

20:33.215 --> 20:34.732
You had a lot to lose,

20:34.800 --> 20:36.851
and people forget the
sacrifices you made.

20:36.935 --> 20:38.019
We wanted to thank you.

just gave me a hug

23:11.871 --> 23:13.255
and told me to never change.

23:13.339 --> 23:14.789
Poor thing is too young
to realize

23:14.874 --> 23:16.124
that change can be so good.

23:16.209 --> 23:17.459
Think...

23:17.543 --> 23:18.927
if we hadn't changed,

23:19.011 --> 23:20.262
we would have never been
friends.

23:20.346 --> 23:22.380
Still so weird having you
call me a friend.

23:25.852 --> 23:27.352
There.
What's this?

23:27.419 --> 23:29.771
A Metro North pass
from New York to New Haven.

23:29.856 --> 23:31.940
I got one for me
into New York.

23:32.024 --> 23:33.942
Everybody keeps talking
about staying in touch,

23:34.026 --> 23:36.228
and I want to make sure
that we do.

23:36.279 --> 23:38.429
Thank you.

23:38.481 --> 23:40.649
Thank you.
It's so sweet.

23:40.733 --> 23:43.652
Although I'm still
not 100% sure

23:43.736 --> 23:45.287
that I'm for
teen weddings,

23:45.371 --> 23:47.939
I'm really happy that you
and Finn are together.

23:47.990 --> 23:49.607
You guys were meant to be.

23:49.659 --> 23:50.876
Yeah.

23:50.943 --> 23:52.160
Thank you.

23:52.245 --> 23:53.795
You know, it's weird
'cause that's how

23:53.880 --> 23:55.380
I always felt
about you and Puck.

23:55.447 --> 23:57.299
Ancient history.

23:57.383 --> 23:59.501
But you know what I mean.
When you two were together,

23:59.585 --> 24:02.053
he was really at his best.

24:02.121 --> 24:03.454
Indian Ocean, show me.

24:03.506 --> 24:05.590
It's no use. My brain is like a
Roach Motel,

24:05.641 --> 24:07.392
once the info checks in,
it never checks out.

24:07.459 --> 24:08.760
I'm out of here.

24:08.811 --> 24:10.562
Don't worry. You still get
your Brownie patch

24:10.629 --> 24:12.063
for trying to help a loser
learn something.

24:12.131 --> 24:14.733
I'm not here for a patch.
I'm here because I love you.

24:14.800 --> 24:16.685
You're my first.

24:18.821 --> 24:21.439
I kind of screwed up
that experience, huh?

24:21.490 --> 24:22.691
No regrets.

24:24.493 --> 24:26.828
Cool. 'Cause I always felt
kind of bad about it.

24:26.913 --> 24:28.313
Feel bad about
a lot of things,

24:28.364 --> 24:30.198
but I was an ass for most
of high school.

24:30.283 --> 24:31.700
I really care about you, Puck.

24:31.784 --> 24:33.785
You know what? I know that after
Beth was born,

24:33.836 --> 24:35.287
we weren't really close.

24:35.338 --> 24:37.672
But when two people go though
what we've been through,

24:37.757 --> 24:39.090
you're bonded for life.

24:39.158 --> 24:41.710
If you ever need me,
you know where to find me...

24:41.794 --> 24:43.161
right here in Lima...

24:43.212 --> 24:44.662
repeating my senior
year forever.

24:44.714 --> 24:47.165
I would have never given
my virginity to this guy.

24:47.216 --> 24:49.884
The Puck I fell in love
with had swagger.

24:49.969 --> 24:51.970
And you know what questions
Miss Duesenberry's
gonna ask you,

24:52.021 --> 24:53.855
so you just need
to get your confidence back

24:53.940 --> 24:55.607
so you can get all
that stuff out

24:55.674 --> 24:56.775
of the Roach Motel.

24:56.842 --> 24:57.842
And how am I supposed
to do that?

24:57.893 --> 24:59.361
Like this.

24:59.445 --> 25:01.029
No, no, wait.

25:01.113 --> 25:02.731
I'm not worth it.

Yale guy

the football team
won sophomore year.

of two things:

26:06.379 --> 26:09.180
either you just returned
from the peroxide factory

26:09.248 --> 26:10.382

having your hair helmet

to you, Sue.

26:20.476 --> 26:23.144
National championships
for both the Glee Club

26:23.229 --> 26:24.479
and the Cheerios!

26:42.581 --> 26:44.966
You and I are never gonna like
each other, Sue Sylvester,

26:45.051 --> 26:47.802
but you and I, we got
something in common.

26:47.887 --> 26:50.055
We both hate the fact
that this school has

26:50.122 --> 26:52.507
an idiot for a principal.

26:52.591 --> 26:56.644
That's why I propose we join
forces and take him down.

Sylvester, while you nurse your

26:59.648 --> 27:00.631
thousand-year-old
vampire baby.

27:00.683 --> 27:02.150
You just be sure
to bottle-feed it

27:02.234 --> 27:04.436
because that baby's gonna use
those sharp-ass teeth

27:04.487 --> 27:07.505
to bite holes in those
saggy old boobs.

27:11.277 --> 27:12.977
Hey, Coach.

27:13.028 --> 27:15.480
It's my Cheerios! uniform,
dry-cleaned and pressed.

27:15.531 --> 27:18.316
You were kind enough
to let me wear it again,

27:18.367 --> 27:20.085
and I figured it was only right
to return it

27:20.152 --> 27:21.252
in case you wanted
to pass it on.

27:21.320 --> 27:22.370

27:27.626 --> 27:28.343
Sit.

27:31.764 --> 27:34.549
You know, when I first
laid eyes on you, Q,

27:34.633 --> 27:38.169
I thought you reminded me
of a young Sue Sylvester,

27:38.220 --> 27:40.505
but looking at this
amazing woman

27:40.556 --> 27:42.507

27:42.558 --> 27:44.759

like me.

27:45.861 --> 27:46.945

as you are

27:49.548 --> 27:52.066
and every bit as pretty,

27:52.151 --> 27:54.219
but somehow you're slightly
less evil.

27:55.821 --> 27:57.822
And I admire that.

28:09.802 --> 28:11.236

28:12.555 --> 28:14.005

28:14.056 --> 28:15.640
"Hey, I remember her
from way back when."

28:15.707 --> 28:18.593
Way back when she was
getting Ryan Seacrest tattoos

28:18.677 --> 28:22.564
and lying about who
the father of her
unborn child was.

28:22.648 --> 28:24.983

28:25.050 --> 28:26.384

and they were really quiet,

36:21.572 --> 36:22.721

'Cause it's not funny.
We're gonna be late.

36:38.071 --> 36:39.956
You're on the
4:25 to New York.

36:40.040 --> 36:42.291
Your dads are gonna meet you
there and they're gonna,

36:42.376 --> 36:45.611
they're gonna help you look
at dorms at the new school.

36:45.679 --> 36:47.546
You're gonna spend four
years of your life there

36:47.598 --> 36:50.132
and you've never even set
foot in the place, so...

36:50.217 --> 36:53.970
But I... I have all year
to go and look at it.

36:54.054 --> 36:55.554
You're gonna go
there in the fall.

36:55.606 --> 36:56.555
All right? You're
not deferring.

36:58.692 --> 36:59.809
We're not
getting married.

36:59.893 --> 37:01.777
You don't want to marry me?

37:01.862 --> 37:04.780
I want to marry you so badly
I can't go through with it.

37:04.865 --> 37:07.533
Yeah, but the thought
of you being stuck here

37:07.600 --> 37:09.702
for another year because
of me, it makes me sick.

37:09.769 --> 37:12.104
Then come with me. Okay?

37:12.155 --> 37:13.739
We can get married
in New York

37:13.790 --> 37:15.908
and live in a little
shoebox apartment together.

37:15.959 --> 37:16.909
It'll be romantic.

37:16.960 --> 37:17.827
Do you love me?

37:17.911 --> 37:19.412
Of course I do.

37:19.463 --> 37:20.630
Then tell me the
truth and not just

37:20.714 --> 37:21.914
something you think
I want to hear.

37:21.965 --> 37:24.417
Are you 100% sure
you want to marry me?

37:24.468 --> 37:27.586
N-No-no one is
100% sure of anything.

37:27.638 --> 37:29.689
I am.

37:29.756 --> 37:32.925
I am that sure you're
something special.

37:32.976 --> 37:35.061
That this is just the
beginning for you.

37:35.128 --> 37:36.929
Okay? Th-That you're
gonna do amazing things.

37:36.980 --> 37:38.314
But to get there,

37:38.398 --> 37:39.899
you got to have these
experiences on your own...

37:39.966 --> 37:41.851
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Listen to me.

37:41.935 --> 37:43.486
You got to have these
experiences on your own.
Wait a minute.

37:43.570 --> 37:44.654
I can't have to be
there with you.

37:44.738 --> 37:46.572
Wait a minute.
Are you breaking up with me?

37:46.639 --> 37:47.773
I'm setting you free.

37:47.824 --> 37:49.075
Oh, my God.

37:49.142 --> 37:52.144
Look, d-do you know how
hard this is for me?

37:52.195 --> 37:53.412
How many times I've
cried about this?

37:53.480 --> 37:54.747
No, I'm not going.

37:54.814 --> 37:56.615
I'm not going,
not without you.

37:56.667 --> 37:58.084
You don't have a choice;
I can't come with you.

37:58.151 --> 37:59.618
Well, then I'll stay here!

37:59.670 --> 38:01.420
I'll go wherever it is
that you're going!

38:01.488 --> 38:02.955
Fort Benning, Georgia?

38:04.825 --> 38:09.545
Look, I-I need a chance to try
and redeem my father, okay?

38:09.629 --> 38:10.846
I-I...
Oh, my God!

38:10.931 --> 38:12.715
Oh, my God,
wait a minute.

38:12.799 --> 38:14.717

38:14.801 --> 38:16.185

(sobbing): I can't believe that
this is happening right now.

38:18.972 --> 38:21.390
It's also one of the places I
knew you couldn't follow me.

38:21.475 --> 38:23.976
Look, you're-you're
gonna get on that train.

38:24.027 --> 38:25.111
Okay?

38:25.178 --> 38:27.346
And you're gonna
go to New York,

38:27.397 --> 38:29.532
and you're
gonna be a star.

38:29.616 --> 38:30.616

38:39.626 --> 38:41.293

that is for you

38:41.361 --> 38:43.546

you hold on to stuff.

38:43.630 --> 38:46.582
But-but we're just gonna,
we're gonna sit here

38:46.666 --> 38:48.384
