WEBVTT

00:02.789 --> 00:04.989
Anyone know why they
called us all in here?

00:04.991 --> 00:07.994
Uh, probably hospital stuff.

00:09.165 --> 00:11.356
I bet Carol knows,
since she's been spending

00:11.358 --> 00:12.746
so much time with her boyfriend

00:12.748 --> 00:14.483
and his cool older friends.

00:15.499 --> 00:18.334
It's nice Carol has people
her own age to talk to.

00:18.336 --> 00:20.336
Sometimes I think it's hard
for her to relate to us.

00:20.338 --> 00:22.470
I don't know. I'm exactly your age,

00:22.472 --> 00:24.576
and I can't relate to you at all.

00:25.542 --> 00:28.845
All right, everybody, everybody.

00:28.847 --> 00:31.180
We have some big news for you all today.

00:31.182 --> 00:33.081
We have an annual
tradition here at Loyola

00:33.083 --> 00:36.552
where we choose an intern
to present at Grand Rounds.

00:36.554 --> 00:38.387
One of us gets to present

00:38.389 --> 00:40.711
in front of all the senior
doctors in the hospital?

00:40.713 --> 00:43.150
And the rest of you will
get to watch me do it.

00:44.161 --> 00:45.684
Congratulations,

00:45.686 --> 00:47.609
Dr. Kenney!

00:47.611 --> 00:50.399
Oh, my gosh! Oh.

00:50.401 --> 00:53.402
- This is so excit...
- In sadder news...

00:53.404 --> 00:56.010
What? No.

00:56.012 --> 00:57.868
I'm still taking in the happy news.

00:57.870 --> 00:59.788
... our beloved chief of staff

00:59.790 --> 01:03.973
of 30 years, Dr. Herman,
died at the tender age of 97.

01:03.975 --> 01:07.211
I know you'll all need
a moment to absorb this.

01:07.213 --> 01:08.911
Thank you.

01:08.913 --> 01:10.047
Wow.

01:10.049 --> 01:11.648
He looked great for 97.

01:11.650 --> 01:13.952
I wouldn't have guessed
he was a day over 93.

01:15.267 --> 01:17.857
It's surprising how
sad I am given that I...

01:17.859 --> 01:20.382
thought he was already dead.

01:20.384 --> 01:22.059
Yeah, it's such a loss.

01:22.061 --> 01:24.654
If only there was
something more positive

01:24.656 --> 01:28.156
that we could focus on so
we could start the healing.

01:28.158 --> 01:30.647
Guys, you're missing
the important thing.

01:30.649 --> 01:32.105
Now that Dr. Herman's gone,

01:32.107 --> 01:34.431
the chief position is up for grabs.

01:34.433 --> 01:36.940
We've had a long era of peace.

01:36.942 --> 01:38.976
Storm's coming.

01:38.978 --> 01:40.433
You're right.

01:40.435 --> 01:41.924
There's a power vacuum.

01:41.926 --> 01:43.847
Chief of staff is the top job here.

01:43.849 --> 01:46.186
Every senior doctor's
gonna be gunning for it.

01:47.687 --> 01:49.556
- Lewis.
- Frost.

01:55.387 --> 01:58.458
Oh-ho-ho, it is on.

02:06.643 --> 02:09.966
I am so proud of you, Mom. I
only just heard of Grand Rounds,

02:09.967 --> 02:12.569
but now that I know what
it is, I am super impressed.

02:12.571 --> 02:14.837
What do you guys think I should present?

02:14.839 --> 02:16.923
I mean, I could discuss a patient.

02:16.925 --> 02:19.893
My rickets case was
interesting, but is it sexy?

02:22.899 --> 02:26.566
Oh, I definitely do not
want to talk to you.

02:26.568 --> 02:27.968
Ooh, is it "unknown number"?

02:27.970 --> 02:29.637
Because I love answering those.

02:29.639 --> 02:31.939
It's like a friend you haven't met yet.

02:31.941 --> 02:33.072
No.

02:33.074 --> 02:34.502
It's my ex-husband, Richard.

02:34.504 --> 02:36.766
He probably senses something
good happened to me,

02:36.768 --> 02:38.825
and he's excited to ruin it.

02:38.827 --> 02:40.150
I'll silence it.

02:40.152 --> 02:42.950
And you made it louder.

02:42.952 --> 02:46.085
Ooh. I bet it's about
my birthday next week.

02:46.087 --> 02:47.901
My dad always wants to split a gift

02:47.903 --> 02:49.591
with my mom because he
doesn't want to spoil me.

02:49.593 --> 02:51.454
I'm not splitting a gift with your dad.

02:51.456 --> 02:52.602
He still hasn't paid me back

02:52.604 --> 02:54.294
for the mattress we got you last year.

02:54.296 --> 02:56.030
That must have set you back.

02:56.032 --> 02:58.268
It is like sleeping on a cloud.

02:59.271 --> 03:01.195
Daniel, what did we talk about?

03:01.197 --> 03:03.397
Boundaries.

03:04.194 --> 03:05.582
Mom, just tell Dad

03:05.584 --> 03:07.274
to give me cash... he can afford it.

03:07.276 --> 03:10.868
It's not like he's scraping by
on his anesthesiologist's salary.

03:10.870 --> 03:11.946
Oops.

03:11.948 --> 03:13.047
I'm sorry, Mom.

03:13.049 --> 03:16.016
Hold up. Carol, your ex was a doctor?

03:16.018 --> 03:18.403
Barely. I mean, he
basically does crosswords

03:18.405 --> 03:21.361
and tries not to lock
people into a living coma.

03:21.363 --> 03:24.563
Wait, so your ex is the reason
you went to med school?

03:24.565 --> 03:27.688
No. And that's exactly why
I never told any of you.

03:27.690 --> 03:29.646
Yeah, that's kind of a sore spot.

03:29.648 --> 03:31.972
And now she's gonna tell you
why she went to med school.

03:31.974 --> 03:33.596
I went to med school

03:33.598 --> 03:36.455
for myself, not for revenge,
not to compete with him,

03:36.457 --> 03:38.181
not because I have anything to prove.

03:38.183 --> 03:39.404
Oh, like you'd have anything

03:39.406 --> 03:41.714
- to prove to an anesthesiologist.
- Yeah.

03:41.716 --> 03:44.280
You have two responsibilities:
put people to sleep

03:44.282 --> 03:45.600
and remember to wake them up.

03:45.602 --> 03:49.093
Oh. And now you've got her
started on anesthesiologists.

03:49.095 --> 03:50.638
It's gonna be a while. Bye, guys.

03:50.640 --> 03:53.376
Well, Carol, you certainly have a type:

03:53.378 --> 03:55.535
tall, dark and doctor.

03:55.537 --> 03:57.813
Doctor is the only thing
they have in common.

03:57.815 --> 04:00.648
My ex never believed
I would really do this.

04:00.650 --> 04:02.851
I just wish he could see me now:

04:02.853 --> 04:05.269
an intern doing Grand Rounds.

04:05.271 --> 04:07.422
He would choke on his driving scarf.

04:08.692 --> 04:11.993
Especially if he knew that your
new boyfriend had a hand in it.

04:11.995 --> 04:14.436
What's that supposed to mean?

04:14.438 --> 04:16.495
Oh, come on, do we really
think it's a coincidence

04:16.497 --> 04:18.719
that the intern who was chosen
happens to be the same intern

04:18.721 --> 04:21.312
who's dating a powerful senior doctor?

04:21.314 --> 04:23.289
You're just jealous.
You know I didn't get this

04:23.291 --> 04:24.607
because I'm dating Victor.

04:24.609 --> 04:26.809
Carol, we're not saying
you did it on purpose.

04:26.811 --> 04:27.943
You're just making the most

04:27.945 --> 04:30.045
of something that fell into your lap.

04:30.047 --> 04:31.881
Yeah, it's just the hand you were dealt,

04:31.883 --> 04:34.486
by the dealer, who you are dating.

04:39.424 --> 04:42.792
Dr. Lewis, good luck with
your chief of staff interview.

04:42.794 --> 04:44.860
Thank you. Mine's at 10:00.

04:44.862 --> 04:46.662
Oh, mine's at 11:00.

04:46.664 --> 04:48.100
Save the best for last.

04:49.100 --> 04:51.734
Well, good luck following me.

04:51.736 --> 04:53.978
I'm not worried about following a man

04:53.980 --> 04:57.876
who can't handle even a single
percentage of fat in his yogurt.

04:59.459 --> 05:01.383
Personally, I'm a two-percent man,

05:01.385 --> 05:04.175
not a zero-percent boy.

05:04.177 --> 05:06.827
Oh, I thought they were out,
but they have one more full-fat

05:06.829 --> 05:08.543
left on the shelf...
oh, and it's blueberry.

05:08.545 --> 05:10.193
- Antioxidant. Nothing better.
- Mm.

05:10.195 --> 05:12.220
Oh, look. Here's pomegranate.

05:12.222 --> 05:14.859
Yeah, it's a superfood.
Beats all other foods.

05:16.620 --> 05:19.257
Guys, they only give
me 20 minutes to eat.

05:21.676 --> 05:22.831
He started it.

05:22.833 --> 05:24.855
I know. I saw.

05:24.857 --> 05:26.689
You know, you guys are just destined

05:26.691 --> 05:28.804
to keep competing for things, huh?

05:28.806 --> 05:31.279
This job. Carol.

05:31.281 --> 05:34.042
As we discussed, Dennis, I am
not interested in Dr. Kenney.

05:34.044 --> 05:36.928
Just admit you have a
schoolboy crush on Carol.

05:36.930 --> 05:39.733
I do not have a schoolboy crush.
I have an adult male enemy.

05:41.622 --> 05:44.179
Okay, here's a casual topic.

05:44.181 --> 05:45.704
What's the most impressive birthday gift

05:45.706 --> 05:47.062
you ever got from a loved one? Go.

05:47.064 --> 05:48.824
Well, if you're talking
about birthday presents,

05:48.826 --> 05:51.025
nothing'll ever top the
very first one I got:

05:51.027 --> 05:52.696
the gift of life.

05:53.898 --> 05:56.064
What have you given
girlfriends in the past?

05:56.066 --> 05:57.932
You know, the usual stuff, like a...

05:57.934 --> 05:59.768
an old sweatshirt that smells like me.

05:59.770 --> 06:02.774
And then I say, "Now
we'll always be close".

06:03.563 --> 06:04.666
Yep, that tracks.

06:05.960 --> 06:08.143
Okay, maybe I'm not
the best at gift-giving.

06:08.145 --> 06:11.146
But this is different; I want
to get Jenny something special.

06:11.148 --> 06:13.785
Well, girls love it when you
adopt a goat in their name.

06:15.392 --> 06:16.648
Honestly, I'm surprised

06:16.650 --> 06:18.686
a woman's ever touched either of you.

06:20.464 --> 06:22.554
Ms. Molina is 53. She presented

06:22.556 --> 06:24.816
with abdominal pain
and shortness of breath.

06:24.818 --> 06:28.043
Oh, fun fact: her book club just
finished reading The Kite Runner

06:28.045 --> 06:30.732
- for the second time.
- So, Ms. Molina,

06:30.734 --> 06:32.001
we'll order an X-ray

06:32.003 --> 06:33.872
to rule out a small bowel obstruction.

06:36.582 --> 06:39.005
Hey, Dr. Gilbert, I'm a little worried

06:39.007 --> 06:40.499
about Ms. Molina's blood pressure.

06:40.501 --> 06:42.364
It's high, and it sounds like her pain

06:42.366 --> 06:43.788
- is exertion...
- Trust me, Dr. Kenney,

06:43.790 --> 06:45.713
everything here points to constipation.

06:45.715 --> 06:48.716
- Oh.
- We'll see a large stool burden on the X-ray.

06:48.718 --> 06:51.987
Given her age and the fact
that she's in a book club,

06:51.989 --> 06:54.859
my guess is that she went
hog wild on a cheese board.

06:56.561 --> 07:00.228
You know, I think it's possible
we might have a cardiac issue.

07:00.230 --> 07:02.230
And I think you should
stop worrying about her

07:02.232 --> 07:03.888
and start prepping
for your Grand Rounds.

07:03.890 --> 07:05.475
- Oh.
- Dr. Lewis

07:05.477 --> 07:07.032
must have gone out on a limb for you,

07:07.034 --> 07:08.737
so you don't want to disappoint him.

07:10.140 --> 07:12.523
Hey. I got this on my own.

07:12.525 --> 07:15.362
If I disappoint anybody,
it's gonna be myself!

07:20.724 --> 07:22.756
Hey.

07:22.758 --> 07:24.507
Well, there she is...
the woman of the hour.

07:24.509 --> 07:27.461
Yeah. It's not that big a deal.

07:27.463 --> 07:30.097
Actually, it's a huge deal,

07:30.099 --> 07:32.367
but I'm getting a very strong vibe

07:32.369 --> 07:34.802
that people think I got Grand Rounds...

07:34.804 --> 07:36.703
because of you.

07:36.705 --> 07:38.623
I was afraid of this.

07:38.625 --> 07:39.947
Did I get it because of you?

07:39.949 --> 07:41.838
No. Of course not.

07:41.840 --> 07:42.930
But hospitals

07:42.932 --> 07:45.756
are hotbeds for gossip... and disease...

07:45.758 --> 07:47.214
but mostly gossip.

07:47.216 --> 07:49.371
I would hate to think that
people thought I got it

07:49.373 --> 07:51.668
- because we're dating... that's not fair.
- No.

07:51.670 --> 07:54.692
It's not. But honestly...

07:54.694 --> 07:57.117
the optics aren't
great for either of us.

07:57.119 --> 07:59.291
I'm under a lot of scrutiny
for the chief of staff job.

07:59.293 --> 08:02.794
- Well, I'm sure.
- Dr. Herman had this job for 30 years.

08:02.796 --> 08:04.749
This comes along only
once in a lifetime.

08:04.751 --> 08:07.421
Especially now that
nobody smokes anymore.

08:10.090 --> 08:14.095
Wait. A-Are you saying I
shouldn't do Grand Rounds?

08:15.160 --> 08:17.028
I hate even suggesting it,

08:17.030 --> 08:19.730
but it might be the best
thing for both of us.

08:21.143 --> 08:23.334
Yeah, I know. I mean, I get it.

08:23.336 --> 08:26.564
It's a big opportunity for
me, but a bigger one for you,

08:26.566 --> 08:27.827
and I-I'm sure there are gonna be

08:27.829 --> 08:30.407
plenty of Grand Rounds in my future.

08:30.409 --> 08:33.020
Hey. If I'm chief of staff,

08:33.023 --> 08:34.546
you won't even have to
work very hard for them.

08:34.548 --> 08:37.751
- That's not funny.
- It's not funny. Okay.

08:39.317 --> 08:41.518
What's the deal? I heard
you're not presenting anymore.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.287
Oh, my God, is it your menopause?

08:44.991 --> 08:47.681
Dr. Lewis thought...
well, we both thought...

08:47.683 --> 08:50.226
that, you know, my being
selected might look bad.

08:50.228 --> 08:53.754
Optically. And optics are,
you know, important for...

08:53.756 --> 08:55.725
appearances.

08:56.740 --> 08:58.762
To be honest...

08:58.764 --> 09:00.165
I'm disappointed.

09:00.167 --> 09:01.715
I recommended you for this,

09:01.717 --> 09:03.468
because I knew you'd do a good job.

09:03.470 --> 09:06.021
- You recommended me?
- Despite your...

09:06.023 --> 09:08.359
"I need to speak to
the manager" energy...

09:09.615 --> 09:12.119
... you've become an
incredible physician.

09:13.312 --> 09:15.512
I'm sure Daniel will do a great job.

09:15.514 --> 09:17.882
Oh, I didn't ask Dr. Kutcher.

09:17.884 --> 09:20.651
Wait. So if you didn't pick Daniel...

09:20.653 --> 09:23.072
and Lexie's here...

09:23.074 --> 09:25.808
- Yeah.
- Oh, no, you didn't.

09:25.810 --> 09:27.744
Hi.

09:27.746 --> 09:28.812
Him?

09:28.814 --> 09:30.884
Me? We talking about me?
What are we talking about?

09:33.708 --> 09:36.166
Hey. So you're doing
the presentation, huh?

09:36.168 --> 09:37.179
- Uh-huh.
- What's your topic?

09:37.181 --> 09:39.146
Oh, Personalized Medicine
and Gene Mapping Using

09:39.148 --> 09:40.772
the Drosophila Melanogaster.

09:40.774 --> 09:41.951
That's what I was gonna do.

09:41.953 --> 09:44.187
I know. And it sounded awesome!

09:44.189 --> 09:46.655
So happy to be of help.

09:48.959 --> 09:50.293
I need chips.

09:50.295 --> 09:52.298
Lots of chips.

09:53.783 --> 09:57.141
Dr. Gilani, could I ask for your
opinion on this medical issue?

09:57.143 --> 09:59.038
I've grouped the gifts
I think Jenny would like

09:59.040 --> 10:01.663
into three categories:
Romantic, Aspirational

10:01.665 --> 10:03.072
and Things I Like.

10:03.074 --> 10:05.476
Romantic and Aspirational are empty.

10:06.661 --> 10:08.451
First of all, I would like to start

10:08.453 --> 10:10.380
by thanking one person

10:10.382 --> 10:11.880
in particular

10:11.882 --> 10:14.116
for allowing me to be up here today.

10:14.118 --> 10:15.952
My dad.

10:15.954 --> 10:17.819
Uh...

10:17.821 --> 10:20.291
Today I'll be presenting on...

10:21.325 --> 10:23.292
Huh. That's, uh...

10:23.294 --> 10:24.875
that's strange.

10:24.877 --> 10:27.394
On my computer, the, uh,
background and the text

10:27.396 --> 10:29.231
weren't the same color.

10:29.233 --> 10:30.899
Well, let's just move on to, uh,

10:30.901 --> 10:33.001
a recent history of gene mapping.

10:33.003 --> 10:36.560
Okay, uh, I actually switched
the color for the background

10:36.562 --> 10:38.521
and the text for this one, but, uh,

10:38.523 --> 10:41.548
again, they are the same.

10:41.550 --> 10:43.572
He's butchering it.

10:43.574 --> 10:45.830
He's butchering my topic.

10:45.832 --> 10:49.351
What is this, the Fort Knox of chips?

10:49.353 --> 10:51.688
Okay, yeah, I see what I did here.

10:51.690 --> 10:55.357
I made the picture way too
big and the text way too small.

10:55.359 --> 10:57.629
That's on me.

11:04.035 --> 11:05.637
I'm gonna take a walk.

11:10.775 --> 11:12.207
Whoa.

11:12.209 --> 11:13.972
Somebody call animal control

11:13.974 --> 11:15.829
'cause there's a
silver fox on the loose.

11:15.831 --> 11:19.881
I'm just off to my interview.

11:19.883 --> 11:22.443
Oh, I've been preparing all day.

11:22.445 --> 11:25.869
If they ask me what my
greatest weakness is,

11:25.871 --> 11:27.875
I'm gonna say pistachio ice cream.

11:29.488 --> 11:32.846
It's actually computers.

11:32.848 --> 11:35.442
You know, we're gonna miss
you down here in the trenches.

11:35.444 --> 11:37.734
Ah, Dennis, I'm gonna miss you, too.

11:37.736 --> 11:39.833
You're probably gonna miss
some other people, too.

11:39.835 --> 11:42.994
Are you me in Wyoming in late August?

11:42.996 --> 11:44.596
Because you're fishing pretty hard.

11:48.146 --> 11:50.145
Carol?

11:50.147 --> 11:51.914
Are Grand Rounds over already?

11:51.916 --> 11:52.948
No, I left.

11:52.950 --> 11:56.385
Seeing Caleb up there,
it... it was hard to watch.

11:59.190 --> 12:01.923
Oh, not now, Richard.

12:01.925 --> 12:04.025
Sorry, it's my ex.

12:04.027 --> 12:06.062
He picked every movie we ever watched,

12:06.064 --> 12:08.997
but I have to choose
Jenny's birthday present.

12:08.999 --> 12:11.002
Code blue.

12:13.171 --> 12:15.753
- Who's running the code?
- You are. You're the first one here.

12:15.755 --> 12:17.306
I'm an intern. Where is everybody?

12:17.308 --> 12:18.841
- Grand Rounds.
- Okay.

12:18.843 --> 12:20.465
Start bagging. Somebody
get a crash cart.

12:20.467 --> 12:21.600
Gonna start a central line.

12:21.602 --> 12:24.593
Dennis, you take over the compressions.

12:24.595 --> 12:26.015
- You got to get that line, Doctor.
- Yeah.

12:26.017 --> 12:29.251
Got it. Give me epi
and a bolus of saline.

12:32.223 --> 12:34.193
We got a pulse.

12:40.795 --> 12:42.862
Excellent work, Dr. Kenney.

12:42.864 --> 12:45.698
An intern running a code,
that's extremely impressive.

12:45.700 --> 12:50.202
Well, wow, I mean, it was a team
effort, so... yeah, thank you,

12:50.204 --> 12:52.806
but that should have never happened.

12:52.808 --> 12:55.096
- What do you mean?
- She didn't have to code.

12:55.098 --> 12:58.644
I knew it wasn't constipation,
and I deferred to Dr. Gilbert.

12:58.646 --> 13:00.179
Ah, we all sometimes miss...

13:00.181 --> 13:02.282
I didn't miss anything. I knew
what was wrong with her,

13:02.284 --> 13:05.619
and I didn't trust myself.
I know what I'm doing.

13:05.621 --> 13:07.120
I should never have deferred to you,

13:07.122 --> 13:08.344
especially when it comes to

13:08.346 --> 13:10.649
a middle-aged woman's constipation.

13:12.664 --> 13:15.023
And I should've never
given up Grand Rounds.

13:15.025 --> 13:16.613
- Carol...
- I earned that.

13:16.615 --> 13:18.664
You know what? I'm done deferring.

13:18.666 --> 13:20.836
I'm sorry about the
optics, but we're over.

13:27.876 --> 13:30.910
Wow.

13:30.912 --> 13:32.980
First the code, then this?

13:32.982 --> 13:35.818
This day's got drama.

13:40.716 --> 13:41.983
Carol, you broke up with me.

13:41.985 --> 13:44.518
You don't have to follow
me into the lounge.

13:44.520 --> 13:45.887
But I want to explain.

13:45.889 --> 13:48.143
Oh, should I go get more people?

13:48.145 --> 13:51.525
Is this too private
and appropriate for you?

13:51.527 --> 13:54.070
I am so, so sorry.

13:54.072 --> 13:55.359
- I got carried away.
- Carol,

13:55.361 --> 13:57.952
you asked me about the optics,
I gave you an honest answer.

13:57.954 --> 13:59.407
Should I have said something else?

13:59.409 --> 14:03.091
No, but I shouldn't have
given up what I wanted for you.

14:03.093 --> 14:04.790
I mean, I didn't launch a whole new life

14:04.792 --> 14:06.763
just to repeat the
patterns of the first one.

14:06.765 --> 14:09.965
That was the old Carol...
who was actually younger...

14:09.967 --> 14:12.383
but the new, older Carol is different.

14:12.385 --> 14:15.522
She only puts one person
first: Current Carol.

14:18.108 --> 14:21.276
I can't keep track of
all the different Carols.

14:21.278 --> 14:23.368
But I guess that doesn't matter

14:23.370 --> 14:25.373
since I'm not dating any of them.

14:27.746 --> 14:30.985
- You are such a wonderful man.
- Hmm.

14:30.987 --> 14:33.989
But I need to do this.

14:33.991 --> 14:37.125
I'm sorry to hear that.

14:37.127 --> 14:39.474
I mean, who knows. Maybe in the future,

14:39.476 --> 14:41.190
Older Old Carol will
regret this, and she...

14:41.192 --> 14:43.329
- Okay, you can leave now.
- Okay.

14:47.137 --> 14:49.938
Dr. Frost, I've been looking for you.

14:49.940 --> 14:51.874
- Did you hear the news?
- Hmm?

14:51.876 --> 14:54.143
Carol dumped Dr. Lewis.

14:54.145 --> 14:55.179
Oh, my.

14:56.079 --> 14:58.013
Dennis.

14:58.015 --> 15:00.148
This may come as a surprise, but...

15:00.150 --> 15:02.154
I haven't been completely forthcoming.

15:03.487 --> 15:06.431
I may have feelings for Dr. Kenney.

15:06.433 --> 15:07.856
As the person who's been

15:07.858 --> 15:09.391
pointing this out for
weeks, I'm shocked.

15:09.393 --> 15:12.327
Dr. Frost, come on, man.
You got to seize the day.

15:12.329 --> 15:15.364
Well, I suppose I should
at least tell her how I feel.

15:15.366 --> 15:18.500
Great. Yes. Uh, uh, now, uh,
tell me what you're thinking.

15:18.502 --> 15:22.003
Oh, well, you've put me
on the spot here, Dennis.

15:22.005 --> 15:26.508
I guess if I saw her at
the end of a long hallway,

15:26.510 --> 15:28.713
I could shout at her.

15:29.755 --> 15:31.547
I don't know about that one.

15:31.549 --> 15:34.149
Oh. Well, you know,
she does love surprises.

15:34.151 --> 15:36.816
You know, maybe I-I hide behind her car

15:36.818 --> 15:38.119
in the parking lot, and then I...

15:38.121 --> 15:39.955
Uh, tell you what.

15:39.957 --> 15:42.068
You think of the words,

15:42.070 --> 15:43.470
- I'll handle the details.
- Ah.

15:43.472 --> 15:45.827
Dennis, your investment in
my happiness is very touching.

15:45.829 --> 15:47.997
I like you, Dr. Frost, but...

15:47.999 --> 15:49.935
I love hospital drama.

15:52.102 --> 15:53.903
Carol,

15:53.905 --> 15:55.793
stop stalling and
give us the juicy deets

15:55.795 --> 15:57.873
and the spicy meatballs
about you and Lewis.

15:57.875 --> 15:59.032
That's between us.

15:59.034 --> 16:01.310
How are you feeling,
and did you like my presentation?

16:01.312 --> 16:03.045
No one liked your presentation.

16:03.047 --> 16:06.080
More importantly, Carol,
where is Dr. Lewis?

16:06.082 --> 16:08.305
I don't think he should
be alone right now.

16:08.307 --> 16:10.530
Dr. Lewis is fine,

16:10.532 --> 16:13.055
and I'm great, really great.

16:13.057 --> 16:15.931
Now's your moment. Go pull her aside.

16:15.933 --> 16:18.167
Now? No, no, no, no. I'll
wait for a better time.

16:18.169 --> 16:21.931
No, no, no, no such thing.
Remember... seize the day.

16:21.933 --> 16:24.099
Because I've made a decision.

16:24.101 --> 16:27.403
From now on, no more
romance, no more dating,

16:27.405 --> 16:30.071
and most importantly, no more men.

16:30.073 --> 16:32.508
Carol Kenney is done with men!

16:32.510 --> 16:34.944
I mean, I-I... I can't even believe

16:34.946 --> 16:36.478
I was dating someone I work with.

16:36.480 --> 16:39.646
It's... Hey, Dr. Frost. I
didn't know you were there.

16:39.648 --> 16:40.850
Ah. Yeah.

16:40.852 --> 16:44.320
Uh, I just came by to say that I agree.

16:44.322 --> 16:46.422
With all these romantic distractions,

16:46.424 --> 16:48.159
sometimes you just
have to say, "Go away!"

16:49.861 --> 16:52.228
I changed my mind.

16:52.230 --> 16:55.029
Not now. Maybe never.

16:55.031 --> 16:57.465
See? You get it.

16:57.467 --> 17:00.201
This is why I'm so
glad you're my friend.

17:00.203 --> 17:02.104
Yes, indeed.

17:02.106 --> 17:05.210
Uh, there's nothing a grown
man needs more than friends.

17:06.510 --> 17:07.876
Okay.

17:07.877 --> 17:09.012
Back to work.

17:11.481 --> 17:13.828
So, how's your quest for the
perfect birthday present going?

17:13.829 --> 17:14.873
Not great.

17:14.875 --> 17:17.712
I'm down to a drum set or a
gift card to Jersey Mike's.

17:20.476 --> 17:22.998
Oof. Well, at least when she dumps you,

17:23.000 --> 17:24.960
you won't have to worry
about a Christmas present.

17:26.163 --> 17:28.196
Why is this so hard?!

17:28.199 --> 17:31.837
Because you actually... care?

17:33.170 --> 17:35.136
Yes.

17:35.138 --> 17:37.605
That's it. I care!

17:37.607 --> 17:41.043
And you just want to find
a way to tell her that.

17:41.045 --> 17:43.144
Yes! The-the reason
this has been so hard

17:43.146 --> 17:44.616
isn't because I'm self-involved.

17:46.149 --> 17:48.383
Okay, it's not only
because I'm self-involved.

17:48.385 --> 17:51.185
It's because I really like Jenny.

17:51.187 --> 17:53.689
My favorite thing in the
world is to see her smile,

17:53.691 --> 17:57.258
and I just want to give her a
gift that'll make her do that.

17:57.260 --> 17:59.564
You mean, do that?

18:03.366 --> 18:04.599
Is all that true?

18:04.601 --> 18:08.403
Yes. It is.

18:08.405 --> 18:12.225
Daniel, that is the nicest
thing anyone's ever said to me.

18:12.227 --> 18:14.116
Or said behind my back...

18:14.118 --> 18:17.155
to someone else... about me.

18:18.316 --> 18:20.418
Well, I meant it.

18:22.420 --> 18:24.322
Guys... I'm right here.

18:27.102 --> 18:29.259
Dennis, just tell us...
who got the chief job?

18:29.261 --> 18:31.184
Hey, I can't help you.

18:31.186 --> 18:34.123
My source for upper-level
gossip was Dr. Herman.

18:35.248 --> 18:37.739
Dr. Frost?

18:37.741 --> 18:39.429
Are congratulations in order?

18:39.431 --> 18:41.912
Oh, no. No, I took
myself out of the running.

18:41.914 --> 18:44.640
- Oh.
- Turns out, I'm not made for a desk job.

18:44.642 --> 18:47.325
I realized I'd miss
the hands-on medicine.

18:47.327 --> 18:51.074
No, I want to work where the
action is, and be with you.

18:51.076 --> 18:52.566
All of you.

18:52.568 --> 18:54.482
Uh, all of you people.

18:54.484 --> 18:58.754
Dr. Lewis, let me extend my
wholehearted congratulations.

18:58.756 --> 19:00.469
Oh, it's not me.

19:00.471 --> 19:02.524
After all that, they hired
someone from the outside.

19:02.526 --> 19:05.363
Afraid you're gonna have to kiss
up to someone else, Dr. Kutcher.

19:06.396 --> 19:08.364
He knows my name.

19:08.366 --> 19:10.365
Dr. Kenney.

19:10.367 --> 19:12.369
Dr. Lewis.

19:13.503 --> 19:16.104
That was awkward.

19:16.106 --> 19:19.741
You know, I have to admit,
I'm glad he didn't get the job.

19:19.743 --> 19:23.144
Can you imagine the horror
of working under your ex?

19:28.881 --> 19:30.738
- Richard?!
- Dad?!

19:30.740 --> 19:32.254
Hi, sweetie.

19:32.256 --> 19:35.228
Mwah. Hi, Carol. I tried to reach you.

19:35.230 --> 19:36.495
You probably thought
it was about splitting

19:36.497 --> 19:39.255
Jenny's birthday gift, but
I already bought her a car.

19:39.257 --> 19:41.047
Wait. Seriously?!

19:41.049 --> 19:43.205
Oh, Dad, that is just...

19:43.207 --> 19:45.113
too much.

19:45.115 --> 19:47.736
A car? That is way too extravagant.

19:47.738 --> 19:50.305
I know it's a splurge,
but I can afford it.

19:50.307 --> 19:52.306
I've got a new job.

19:52.308 --> 19:54.108
I'm the new chief of staff.

19:54.110 --> 19:55.277
Where?

19:55.279 --> 19:56.580
Here.

19:59.316 --> 20:01.318
What?

20:02.318 --> 20:04.585
What?

20:04.587 --> 20:06.822
That sucks.

20:06.824 --> 20:08.790
Drama, drama everywhere.

20:08.792 --> 20:11.537
I'm so very happy.

20:11.539 --> 20:13.984
Well, I also am very happy to be here.

20:13.986 --> 20:15.040
I'm Dr. Kenney.

20:15.042 --> 20:17.914
I'm Dr. Kenney!

20:19.094 --> 20:20.602
This is gonna be great.

20:20.604 --> 20:22.204
This is a nightmare.
