WEBVTT

00:07.574 --> 00:09.274
Ugh!

00:10.510 --> 00:13.612
Narrator: on this episode
of "mythbusters"...

00:13.613 --> 00:17.816
Adam and Jamie bite the bullet
on an all-time classic myth.

00:17.817 --> 00:19.551
I'm told
it's only going to hurt a lot.

00:19.552 --> 00:22.654
Do some people tolerate pain
better than others?

00:22.655 --> 00:23.822
Ow.

00:23.823 --> 00:25.391
From natural redheads...

00:25.392 --> 00:26.892
I am proud
to be one of them.

00:26.893 --> 00:28.527
...to men versus women,

00:28.528 --> 00:31.030
Which group
has the right stuff?

00:31.031 --> 00:32.531
Jamie: those are
some tough mothers.

00:32.531 --> 00:34.933
And is swearing really a cure...

00:34.934 --> 00:36.101
Fudge!!

00:36.102 --> 00:37.736
...or just a curse?

00:37.737 --> 00:39.671
Oh [bleep]
sweet relief.

00:39.672 --> 00:41.774
Meanwhile, tory, grant, and kari

00:41.775 --> 00:44.343
Tackle the myth
of ballistic barbecues...

00:44.344 --> 00:45.711
Let's torch this thing!

00:45.712 --> 00:48.380
...to see if a propane tank
that's feeling the heat...

00:48.381 --> 00:50.816
we have
the best job ever!

00:50.817 --> 00:54.420
...is really a rocket
just biding its time.

00:54.421 --> 00:56.155
3...2...1!

00:56.156 --> 00:58.090
[ laughter ]

01:01.428 --> 01:03.929
Who are the mythbusters?

01:03.930 --> 01:05.129
Adam savage...

01:05.131 --> 01:07.132
Am i missing an eyebrow?

01:07.133 --> 01:08.734
...and jamie hyneman.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.769
Relax.
this won't hurt a bit.

01:10.770 --> 01:15.207
Between them, more than 30 years
of special-effects experience.

01:15.208 --> 01:16.975
I ate a radio for science!

01:16.976 --> 01:19.812
Narrator:
joining them -- tory belleci...

01:19.813 --> 01:21.180
I am ...on fireÂ‚

01:21.181 --> 01:22.448
...grant imahara...

01:22.449 --> 01:23.582
Burn!

01:23.583 --> 01:25.751
...and kari byron.
it's terrifying!

01:25.752 --> 01:28.353
They don't just tell the myths.

01:28.354 --> 01:30.756
They put them to the test.

01:37.030 --> 01:40.999
First up,
a myth for the masochists.

01:44.137 --> 01:45.871
Pain!

01:45.872 --> 01:48.040
Okay, that's creepy.
what are you doing?

01:48.041 --> 01:50.142
Don't you remember when spock
was talking to the lava monster?

01:50.143 --> 01:51.310
Okay, never mind.

01:51.311 --> 01:53.412
We are doing
a whole set of stories

01:53.413 --> 01:54.713
Specifically about pain.

01:54.714 --> 01:56.982
I've got one --
you're a pain in the [bleep]

01:56.983 --> 01:59.017
Okay, no, that's not
one of the ones we're doing.

01:59.018 --> 02:01.353
We got three stories.

02:01.354 --> 02:04.223
One is that women
can stand more pain than men.

02:04.224 --> 02:07.693
Two is that redheads can't stand
very much pain at all,

02:07.694 --> 02:09.595
And the third -- and i think
you're gonna like this --

02:09.596 --> 02:11.330
Is that supposedly cursing

02:11.331 --> 02:13.265
Increases your ability
to withstand pain.

02:13.266 --> 02:15.334
Well,
i bleeping love that.

02:15.335 --> 02:16.735
I thought you would.

02:16.736 --> 02:20.639
Narrator: now, adam has more
than a passing acquaintance

02:20.640 --> 02:22.875
With pain...
ow. ow.

02:22.876 --> 02:25.978
...and here's just a few
of his greatest hits.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.080
But adam himself hasn't a clue

02:28.081 --> 02:31.450
If his tolerance for pain
is any better than the next guy.

02:31.451 --> 02:33.585
Jamie: we're gonna have to
stitch your mouth shut,

02:33.586 --> 02:34.987
I think, for this.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.355
Na-hah, you wish.

02:36.356 --> 02:38.190
So, how's this
gonna work?

02:38.191 --> 02:40.692
Well, clearly we're gonna
have to subject a lot of people

02:40.693 --> 02:42.661
To pain in order to test
these stories.

02:42.662 --> 02:43.896
I can do that.

02:43.897 --> 02:47.466
While i'm sure that you have
some fascinating ideas,

02:47.467 --> 02:49.301
The fact is
that professional scientists

02:49.302 --> 02:51.236
Have been studying this subject
for years,

02:51.237 --> 02:53.272
And i think it would behoove us
to go to them

02:53.273 --> 02:55.140
<i>and ask them what techniques
they'r using</i>

02:55.141 --> 02:56.241
Because, remember,

02:56.242 --> 02:58.143
We've got to do this
without damaging anybody.

02:58.144 --> 02:59.511
Oh.

02:59.512 --> 03:01.180
Okay.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.582
The best man to consult
on the subject

03:03.583 --> 03:05.951
Works at stanford university.

03:05.952 --> 03:09.821
Your aches and spasms
are his bread and butter.

03:09.822 --> 03:12.691
Dr. chu, how is it
you know so much about pain?

03:12.692 --> 03:16.094
Well, i'm an anesthesiologist,
but i'm also a pain researcher.

03:16.095 --> 03:17.596
And i have a lab
here at stanford

03:17.597 --> 03:19.464
Where i work on discovering
new therapies

03:19.465 --> 03:20.499
And treatments for pain.

03:20.500 --> 03:21.800
In order
to do that work,

03:21.801 --> 03:24.303
I need to be able to reliably
induce pain in my patients.

03:24.304 --> 03:26.471
With dr. chu's help,

03:26.472 --> 03:31.143
We'll road-test four kinds
of, uh, clinical torture

03:31.144 --> 03:34.012
To find out the best one
for testing the myths.

03:34.013 --> 03:36.915
They, uh.probabl won't cause
any real damage.

03:36.916 --> 03:37.983
First up is heat.

03:37.984 --> 03:39.451
This little black box here

03:39.452 --> 03:41.987
Is actually a precisely
controllable heater,

03:41.988 --> 03:44.356
Which soon we will strap
to jamie's arm,

03:44.357 --> 03:46.858
And increase the heat
until he can't stand it anymore.

03:46.859 --> 03:48.594
What could be better than that?

03:48.595 --> 03:49.761
Hi, jamie.

03:49.762 --> 03:51.230
Hello.

03:51.231 --> 03:54.066
Narrator: jamie's told that
his arm will get steadily hotter

03:54.067 --> 03:56.301
Over the next 60 seconds,

03:56.302 --> 03:59.638
Or until he can't stand it
no more.

03:59.639 --> 04:01.607
So, here's the button
that you'll press.

04:01.608 --> 04:03.108
This goes
in your right hand.

04:03.109 --> 04:06.311
So, either red button will
turn off the heat immediately.

04:06.312 --> 04:07.679
Okay.

04:07.680 --> 04:10.916
Abby also requests
that he speaks out

04:10.917 --> 04:14.553
The instant
he first feels real pain.

04:14.554 --> 04:18.055
And that would qualify
as pain.

04:18.057 --> 04:19.791
Ow!

04:19.791 --> 04:21.593
But this is jamie
we're watching --

04:21.594 --> 04:24.596
A man so tough,
he occasionally rusts.

04:24.597 --> 04:26.265
So, that maxed out.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.599
[ chuckles ]

04:27.600 --> 04:29.234
Well, thank you.
that was fun.

04:29.235 --> 04:30.435
Thank you.

04:30.436 --> 04:33.705
So, here's the question
for our man of steel...

04:33.706 --> 04:36.475
Is this
what we're shopping for?

04:36.476 --> 04:38.677
I have to say
that was quite painful,

04:38.678 --> 04:40.712
And it did leave a mark.

04:40.713 --> 04:43.282
Whether we want to subject
a bunch of people to that,

04:43.283 --> 04:45.517
I'm not so sure at this point.

04:45.518 --> 04:49.087
<i>narrator: next up, we'll change
lab rats an methods.</i>

04:49.088 --> 04:52.424
This one promises pain
like you wouldn't believe.

04:52.425 --> 04:55.060
I am about to have capsaicin,

04:55.061 --> 04:58.664
Which is the primary element
in various spicy peppers,

04:58.665 --> 05:00.999
Injected just under my skin.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.402
I'm told
it's only going to hurt a lot.

05:03.403 --> 05:05.771
Narrator: now, we've already had
an excruciating brush

05:05.772 --> 05:07.506
With capsaicin

05:07.507 --> 05:09.408
When tory, grant, and kari

05:09.409 --> 05:13.011
Bravely set out to find a cure
for hot chili mouth.

05:13.012 --> 05:16.348
If capsaicin
does that to your tongue,

05:16.349 --> 05:18.884
Just imagine the pain
from a hypodermic injection.

05:18.885 --> 05:20.052
Hi, adam.

05:20.053 --> 05:22.187
<i>okay, now what i want you
to do is no move</i>

05:22.188 --> 05:23.288
When i do this, okay?

05:23.289 --> 05:25.624
That'll be your instinct,
but do not move.

05:25.625 --> 05:27.592
Okay, here we go.

05:27.593 --> 05:29.261
Adam: okay.

05:29.262 --> 05:30.796
Ow! oh!

05:30.797 --> 05:32.631
Wow!

05:32.632 --> 05:33.865
On a scale
of zero to 10?

05:33.866 --> 05:34.900
[ groans ]

05:34.901 --> 05:37.369
Oh, god!
okay, maybe a 6.

05:37.370 --> 05:41.640
Ugh, it really feels
like i'm being burnt!

05:41.641 --> 05:43.442
See, i'm not used to
feeling a pain

05:43.443 --> 05:45.344
That's not actually
causing me damage,

05:45.345 --> 05:47.145
So i really want to,
like, move

05:47.146 --> 05:49.047
And run water on it
or something.

05:49.048 --> 05:50.982
Yeah, you want to see
something, too,

05:50.983 --> 05:52.517
To make it worth it,
right?

05:52.518 --> 05:54.019
Oh! whoa!

05:54.020 --> 05:56.221
On a "mythbusters"
pain scale,

05:56.222 --> 05:58.724
This is not quite as bad
as getting my tongue pierced...

05:58.725 --> 06:01.626
Woman: here you go.
little breath in...and out.

06:01.627 --> 06:04.129
...especially the fact that
it goes away after 10 minutes,

06:04.130 --> 06:06.431
But i don't think
i'd want to do this

06:06.432 --> 06:08.900
To a bunch of test subjects
in our shop.

06:08.901 --> 06:11.436
I'd say this is a no-go.

06:11.437 --> 06:13.772
I'm gonna go now.

06:13.773 --> 06:15.307
Narrator:
so, while adam recovers,

06:15.308 --> 06:18.443
It's jamie's turn
back in the hot seat.

06:18.444 --> 06:20.946
Next up is electric pain.

06:20.947 --> 06:24.816
Soon a pair of electrodes
will be strapped to jamie's arm,

06:24.817 --> 06:27.919
Touching his skin, and a current
will be run through them.

06:27.920 --> 06:31.523
This will irritate his nerves
and cause a local pain response,

06:31.524 --> 06:33.358
And then [chuckles]
that's not all --

06:33.359 --> 06:36.695
Then this device,
called a von frey hair,

06:36.696 --> 06:39.498
Will be poked
around the painful area

06:39.499 --> 06:41.566
To map the area of sensitivity.

06:41.567 --> 06:43.869
If jamie has
any facial expressions at all,

06:43.870 --> 06:45.904
This is likely to be thrilling.

06:45.905 --> 06:48.306
Narrator: dr. chu
marks the shape of a star

06:48.307 --> 06:50.142
On jamie's left forearm.

06:50.143 --> 06:52.511
The plan is to prod him
when this is all over

06:52.512 --> 06:54.613
To test his sensitivity.

06:54.614 --> 06:56.381
Now, that's pretty.
okay, jamie.

06:56.382 --> 06:58.483
I'm going to hook you up
to this electrical current

06:58.484 --> 06:59.918
And i'm gonna let it run
for 30 minutes,

06:59.919 --> 07:01.153
And then i'll be back.

07:01.154 --> 07:05.857
That's a long time
for jamie to slowly suffer.

07:05.858 --> 07:07.426
Wow, this is kind of like

07:07.427 --> 07:10.629
Being hooked up to an electric
fence for a half-hour.

07:10.630 --> 07:15.133
It's not excruciating,
but it's not very nice.

07:15.134 --> 07:17.502
In due course, dr. chu returns

07:17.503 --> 07:20.071
To inflict
some scientific stabbing.

07:20.072 --> 07:21.907
Well,
i have a great idea now

07:21.908 --> 07:23.475
Of your overall
electrical-pain threshold

07:23.476 --> 07:25.143
And your area
of sensitivity,

07:25.144 --> 07:27.212
Which was what this test
was designed to measure.

07:27.213 --> 07:29.681
Okay, so that means we can
turn it off now.

07:30.750 --> 07:33.919
So, now to the fourth
and final torment.

07:33.920 --> 07:36.788
We all know
that extreme cold can kill.

07:36.789 --> 07:38.857
It can also hurt like hell.

07:38.858 --> 07:40.892
Jamie: adam's gonna be
putting his hand

07:40.893 --> 07:42.761
All the way down
into this ice bath

07:42.762 --> 07:44.296
Where it's just above freezing.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.731
First he'll feel cold,
then he'll feel pain,

07:46.732 --> 07:49.201
And then when he just
can't stand it anymore,

07:49.202 --> 07:50.702
He'll pull his hand out.

07:50.703 --> 07:54.039
Now, this is called
the cold pressor test,

07:54.040 --> 07:56.842
And it's the oldest
and most well-established

07:56.843 --> 08:00.779
Pain-induction technique
used in pain research.

08:00.780 --> 08:04.149
Narrator: the temperature
is just above freezing,

08:04.150 --> 08:06.618
And the rules are the same
as before --

08:06.619 --> 08:08.720
Just hang on as long as you can.

08:10.356 --> 08:12.724
<i>adam: look, it's one thing
to read about a technique</i>

08:12.725 --> 08:14.526
Like immersing your hand
in ice water

08:14.527 --> 08:16.127
<i>and quite another to do it.</i>

08:16.128 --> 08:17.395
And the most surprising thing --

08:17.396 --> 08:19.598
And i guess this shouldn't
be surprising to me --

08:19.599 --> 08:21.633
Is that it hurts --
it hurts right away,

08:21.634 --> 08:23.268
And it's quite intense.

08:23.269 --> 08:25.337
Narrator: adam would like
to go the distance,

08:25.338 --> 08:26.538
But it's not gonna happen.

08:26.539 --> 08:27.772
No, here we go!

08:27.773 --> 08:29.274
Aaaah.

08:29.275 --> 08:31.142
That's it.

08:31.143 --> 08:32.344
Ow!

08:32.345 --> 08:33.979
That's intense!
yeah. good job.

08:33.980 --> 08:36.114
Adam lasted just 59 seconds,

08:36.115 --> 08:39.251
So we know that it hurts
like the devil.

08:39.251 --> 08:40.684
Aaaah.

08:40.686 --> 08:45.090
After sampling four distinct
kinds of supervised soreness,

08:45.091 --> 08:47.025
All that remains
is to choose their poison.

08:47.026 --> 08:48.560
Do you feel
more manly now?

08:48.561 --> 08:50.629
A little.
a little bit.

08:50.630 --> 08:53.198
Shall we recap
what we learned at stanford?

08:53.199 --> 08:55.700
I think we need to throw out
chili peppers and electricity

08:55.701 --> 08:58.370
Because they're designed
to test sensitivity,

08:58.371 --> 09:00.038
Not how much pain
you can take.

09:00.039 --> 09:03.475
Okay, that leaves
heat and ice.

09:03.476 --> 09:04.476
I'm going with ice

09:04.477 --> 09:06.278
Because it's been around
the longest

09:06.279 --> 09:07.879
And it's
the most widely used.

09:07.880 --> 09:09.014
Ice it is.

09:09.015 --> 09:11.316
Well, let's start by testing
whether or not women

09:11.317 --> 09:14.119
Actually do have a higher
pain tolerance than men.

09:14.120 --> 09:15.820
Okay.

09:15.821 --> 09:18.723
So, it's gloves off
between women and men

09:18.724 --> 09:21.226
To see who can outlast
the deep freeze.

09:21.227 --> 09:24.663
But before we can settle
this test of the toughest,

09:24.664 --> 09:27.332
The boys need to
scratch-build a rig

09:27.333 --> 09:30.769
That can serve up the pain
and cater for comfort.

09:30.770 --> 09:34.239
To make the testing
more tv-friendly,

09:34.240 --> 09:37.809
Adam turns a normal kitchen
clock into a giant stopwatch.

09:37.810 --> 09:40.211
Now, to operate this clock,
i've rigged up

09:40.212 --> 09:42.380
A sort of electronic-armrest
dead man's switch,

09:42.381 --> 09:44.583
So the moment you put your hand
in the ice

09:44.584 --> 09:46.418
And rest your arm
on the armrest,

09:46.419 --> 09:48.119
The clock starts.

09:48.120 --> 09:51.256
Then the second you lift
your arm out, the clock stops.

09:51.257 --> 09:52.991
Narrator:
jamie's recirculating pump

09:52.992 --> 09:56.795
Should ensure the ice water
stays at one degree celsius

09:56.796 --> 09:59.431
For as long
as the testing takes.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.333
The chill chair
is ready for action.

10:01.334 --> 10:03.368
I like it.

10:03.369 --> 10:07.339
Upstairs, 25 men and 25 women

10:07.340 --> 10:09.941
Have no idea
what they're in for.

10:11.000 --> 10:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:18.380 --> 10:20.915
That could ruin
your next barbecue.

10:20.916 --> 10:23.184
So, you're looking excited.
what's up?
it's our myth.

10:23.185 --> 10:25.653
It's a good one, which kind of
reminds me of my childhood.

10:25.654 --> 10:27.088
Okay, hit me.

10:27.089 --> 10:29.490
All right, imagine a garage
or a shed is on fire.

10:29.491 --> 10:33.427
Inside is a barbecue
with...a propane tank.

10:33.428 --> 10:36.263
It explodes
and turns into a rocket,

10:36.264 --> 10:38.833
Launching 150 feet
into the air.

10:38.834 --> 10:40.334
Oh, i've heard of this one.

10:40.335 --> 10:41.836
It's very similar
to the water-heater rocket.

10:41.837 --> 10:44.405
The heat causes the pressure
inside the tank to build,

10:44.406 --> 10:46.207
Then there's
a catastrophic rupture

10:46.208 --> 10:48.309
And sends the tank
flying up into the sky.

10:48.310 --> 10:50.578
Wait, wait, wait -- this reminds
you of your childhood?

10:50.579 --> 10:52.079
Yeah.
i'd rather not talk about it.

10:52.080 --> 10:54.582
My parents
are still a little upset.

10:54.583 --> 10:56.817
Narrator: like they said,
this isn't the first time

10:56.818 --> 11:00.821
We've, uh, adapted
a pressure vessel...

11:00.822 --> 11:04.759
Or deliberately
set one on fire...

11:04.760 --> 11:09.030
Or even tried to turn a gas tank
into a missile...

11:09.031 --> 11:11.098
But if this myth is true,

11:11.099 --> 11:14.635
Catastrophe could be brewing
in your own backyard.

11:14.636 --> 11:17.238
The story goes
that a propane tank

11:17.239 --> 11:19.073
Once became a rocket,

11:19.074 --> 11:23.144
And its perfect trajectory
hit 150 feet.

11:23.145 --> 11:25.479
Look, i got to say i've got
my doubts about this.

11:25.480 --> 11:26.947
How so?

11:26.948 --> 11:29.250
Propane tanks, just like all
of the pressurized vessels,

11:29.251 --> 11:31.118
Have a pressure-relief valve
built in.

11:31.119 --> 11:34.021
When the pressure gets too high,
they simply vent off the excess,

11:34.022 --> 11:35.856
Thereby averting
the catastrophic failure.

11:35.857 --> 11:38.826
Yeah, but what if the fire
is so intense

11:38.827 --> 11:41.128
That the pressure is building
faster inside the tank

11:41.129 --> 11:43.164
Than the relief valve
can dump out?

11:43.165 --> 11:44.799
I suppose it's possible.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.434
Fun day
at the bomb range!

11:46.435 --> 11:47.568
[ laughter ]

11:47.569 --> 11:49.570
Now, for this myth,
we need a burning garage

11:49.571 --> 11:51.205
With a propane tank
inside of it.

11:51.206 --> 11:53.741
Now, since no one's gonna let us
burn down a garage,

11:53.742 --> 11:55.009
We need to build our own.

11:55.010 --> 11:57.144
But we don't have time
to build a full-sized one,

11:57.145 --> 11:58.979
So we're going to make
a miniature one.

11:58.980 --> 12:00.881
But we're still gonna build it
up to code.

12:00.882 --> 12:02.817
It's gonna have studs
every 16 inches.

12:02.818 --> 12:05.352
It's gonna have three walls,
a driveway, and a roof.

12:05.353 --> 12:08.255
Now, that should be
plenty of material to burn

12:08.256 --> 12:10.324
In order to get this garage
hot enough

12:10.325 --> 12:12.960
To turn this propane tank
into a rocket.

12:12.961 --> 12:14.595
Narrator: here on the show,
we like to say

12:14.596 --> 12:17.665
That every day's a good day
for an explosion.

12:17.666 --> 12:20.768
But some days are definitely
better than others.

12:20.769 --> 12:22.203
I thought
the dangerous part

12:22.204 --> 12:24.071
Was gonna be
the exploding propane tank.

12:24.072 --> 12:25.906
You all right?
oh, no!

12:25.907 --> 12:28.275
It's hardly a firm foundation,

12:28.276 --> 12:30.177
But the guys know that today,

12:30.178 --> 12:33.180
The joys of shed ownership
will be fleeting.

12:33.181 --> 12:34.648
Whoo!

12:34.649 --> 12:37.118
They're now ready to install
the stunt barbecue,

12:37.119 --> 12:39.120
And the star of the show.

12:39.121 --> 12:41.255
Hey, don't forget
the propane.

12:41.256 --> 12:44.892
It came straight
from my garage.

12:44.893 --> 12:48.362
But there's still some fuel
to add to the fire.

12:48.363 --> 12:51.932
Grant: so, this kind of looks
like a lot of firewood, right?

12:51.933 --> 12:54.969
Well, it is,
because what we want

12:54.970 --> 12:58.038
Is for this fire to burn
long and hot.

12:58.039 --> 13:01.041
Narrator: so they stack the shed
with wood and charcoal --

13:01.042 --> 13:04.311
Two common commodities
that should catch fire

13:04.312 --> 13:06.180
And raise the temperature.

13:06.181 --> 13:08.349
Tory: now, this fire
is gonna get so hot

13:08.350 --> 13:11.418
That there is a good chance that
this tank is gonna explode.

13:11.419 --> 13:13.020
Narrator:
but we want a rocket.

13:13.021 --> 13:16.390
And if the relief valve does
its job, this could turn out

13:16.391 --> 13:19.059
To be nothing more
than a backyard bonfire.

13:19.060 --> 13:22.496
Then again, one of the great
things about "mythbusters"

13:22.497 --> 13:24.398
Is that we're so often wrong.

13:24.399 --> 13:26.867
After a liberal splash
of gasoline...

13:26.868 --> 13:28.269
That ought to do it.

13:28.270 --> 13:30.371
...the team shows its flair
[flare]

13:30.372 --> 13:31.939
For setting a fire.

13:31.940 --> 13:33.641
Grant: all right,
you guys ready?

13:33.642 --> 13:35.442
Ready!
let's torch this thing!

13:35.443 --> 13:38.612
In 3, 2, 1.

13:38.613 --> 13:41.115
Kari: whoa!

13:41.116 --> 13:42.683
Run!

13:42.684 --> 13:45.953
Narrator: each passing second
feels like 10

13:45.954 --> 13:48.856
As they hightail it
back to the bunker.

13:48.857 --> 13:50.891
Oh, that thing
is going up!
oh, my god!

14:00.135 --> 14:01.368
Okay.

14:01.369 --> 14:04.205
By the time they arrive,
the shed's an inferno.

14:04.206 --> 14:07.975
Okay, the flir cam
says 302 degrees.

14:07.976 --> 14:09.643
Look at that --
it's just all white.

14:09.644 --> 14:13.480
Narrator: then, with the
temperature passing 800 degrees,

14:13.481 --> 14:15.449
The safety valve
finally kicks in,

14:15.450 --> 14:18.352
Doing exactly
what it's supposed to do.

14:18.353 --> 14:20.087
There it goes!

14:20.088 --> 14:21.188
The relief valve
just broke.

14:21.189 --> 14:24.458
Look at that --
it's like a flame thrower.

14:24.459 --> 14:26.894
So, thar she blows,

14:26.895 --> 14:28.963
And the cylinder
didn't move an inch.

14:28.964 --> 14:30.931
The valve released
the gas pressure

14:30.932 --> 14:33.434
Faster than the tank
could build it up.

14:33.435 --> 14:37.104
Grant: the important thing is
that the tank did not rupture.

14:37.105 --> 14:38.572
There was no explosion.

14:38.573 --> 14:41.508
And we saw a jet of fire,
but no thrust,

14:41.509 --> 14:43.978
Which would make a rocket.

14:43.979 --> 14:45.546
Narrator:
so the shed bites the dust,

14:45.547 --> 14:47.715
But there's room
for improvement.

14:49.584 --> 14:51.685
So this myth is not confirmed
under normal circumstances.

14:51.686 --> 14:53.287
It looks like
we're gonna have to disable

14:53.288 --> 14:55.256
The pressure-relief valve
to get any sort of result.

14:55.257 --> 14:57.925
Maybe we need to go
back to the shop, change
the circumstances

14:57.926 --> 15:00.294
To get one of these tanks
to act more like a rocket.

15:00.295 --> 15:02.229
All right.

15:03.398 --> 15:05.599
Narrator: coming up,
adam and jamie

15:05.600 --> 15:08.636
Finally settle the biggest
gender myth of all.

15:08.637 --> 15:11.472
Can women really take more pain
than men?

15:11.473 --> 15:13.207
Hurts, doesn't it?
yes, it does.

15:20.348 --> 15:22.983
Narrator: this myth is called
"no pain, no gain,"

15:22.984 --> 15:27.187
Though i must admit it's often
hard to see an upside.

15:27.188 --> 15:30.324
Adam and jamie have settled
on their torment of choice,

15:30.325 --> 15:32.893
Which is sticking your arm
in an ice bath

15:32.894 --> 15:34.962
To see who lasts the longest.

15:34.963 --> 15:40.067
And the very first contest
is men versus women.

15:40.068 --> 15:43.137
The volunteers have all been
declared fit and healthy.

15:43.138 --> 15:46.674
None of them know there's
a 3-minute cap on the ice dunk.

15:46.675 --> 15:50.444
In fact, they don't even know
why they're here.

15:50.445 --> 15:52.713
And now it's time
for women versus men,

15:52.714 --> 15:53.981
Specifically the myth

15:53.982 --> 15:56.684
That women have a higher
tolerance for pain than men.

15:56.685 --> 15:58.185
Why is this interesting?

15:58.186 --> 16:01.655
Well, men are viewed as strong,
and women are viewed as weak.

16:01.656 --> 16:04.591
And wouldn't it be lovely
if the reverse were true?

16:04.592 --> 16:07.594
Narrator: it sure would,
and we're about to find out.

16:07.595 --> 16:10.331
Yeah, so, i want you to keep
your fingers apart

16:10.332 --> 16:13.100
So that they get as cold
as possible.

16:13.101 --> 16:14.234
Okay.

16:14.235 --> 16:15.836
And hold your hand still
in the bucket.

16:15.837 --> 16:18.005
You don't have to do this.
are you okay with it?

16:18.006 --> 16:19.173
I'm fine.
okay.

16:19.174 --> 16:21.375
Melissa, commence.

16:22.844 --> 16:24.144
Other than that,

16:24.145 --> 16:26.613
The instructions are much
like the guys got at stanford --

16:26.614 --> 16:30.784
Sing out when it hurts and pull
out when it's all too much.

16:30.785 --> 16:32.186
That's pain.

16:32.187 --> 16:33.654
Jamie: okay.

16:33.655 --> 16:34.722
You got it?

16:34.723 --> 16:36.156
I got it.

16:36.157 --> 16:38.158
Narrator:
as the seconds tick by,

16:38.159 --> 16:42.196
Melissa proves more than a match
for the arm-numbing pain.

16:42.197 --> 16:44.798
Jamie:
and you're done.

16:44.799 --> 16:47.201
You're done. we have
a 3-minute safety cutoff.

16:47.202 --> 16:49.036
[ laughs ]
excellent.

16:49.037 --> 16:51.805
You did amazing!
oh, my gosh!

16:51.806 --> 16:55.609
Narrator: that's a positive
start for girls versus guys,

16:55.610 --> 16:59.613
But the following females fall
way short of that magic mark.

16:59.614 --> 17:02.916
Now, be sure to tell us
whenever you start to feel pain.

17:02.917 --> 17:04.585
All right,
it's starting to hurt.

17:04.586 --> 17:05.618
Okay.

17:05.619 --> 17:07.521
Narrator:
the next four contestants

17:07.521 --> 17:09.223
Are much more like adam --

17:09.223 --> 17:11.458
They all last
less than a minute.

17:11.459 --> 17:13.394
While adam crunches the numbers,

17:13.395 --> 17:16.896
Our paramedic sanjay is on hand
to check their vitals.

17:16.897 --> 17:20.267
You feeling dizzy, light-headed,
anything like that?

17:20.268 --> 17:22.435
Any chest pain,
shortness of breath? okay.

17:22.436 --> 17:24.438
Continue drying your hand
and come with me.

17:24.439 --> 17:25.539
All right.

17:25.540 --> 17:28.075
But how can a simple tub
of cold water

17:28.076 --> 17:30.010
Cause so much discomfort?

17:30.011 --> 17:32.312
So, how does ice water
cause pain?

17:32.313 --> 17:35.015
Well, you have special receptors
in your skin

17:35.016 --> 17:36.316
Called "nociceptors,"

17:36.317 --> 17:39.153
And these are specifically
to sense temperature.

17:39.154 --> 17:41.255
So when your skin temperature
gets low enough,

17:41.256 --> 17:43.090
These send a signal
to your spinal cord

17:43.091 --> 17:44.425
And then to your brain,

17:44.426 --> 17:46.727
And this is what you interpret
as pain.

17:46.728 --> 17:50.164
Now, the goal here is to get you
to remove your hand

17:50.165 --> 17:52.733
Before you receive
any actual damage.

17:52.734 --> 17:55.235
Narrator: so, the tolerance
testing begins for the men,

17:55.236 --> 17:57.571
And just like the women,

17:57.572 --> 18:00.774
They have no idea that this is
a battle of the sexes.

18:00.775 --> 18:02.776
Go ahead.

18:02.777 --> 18:04.545
All right,
keep your fingers spread.

18:04.546 --> 18:05.712
There we go.

18:05.713 --> 18:08.248
And tell us when you first
experience pain.

18:08.249 --> 18:11.418
For the record,
that takes just 15 seconds.

18:11.419 --> 18:13.454
Okay, i've got
some pain now.
okay.

18:14.489 --> 18:18.392
Half a minute later, thomas,
who looks as tough as teak,

18:18.393 --> 18:20.260
Has had enough.

18:20.261 --> 18:21.662
[ clicks tongue ]

18:21.663 --> 18:23.664
All right, then.
whew!

18:23.665 --> 18:25.199
It hurts,
doesn't it?
yes, it does.

18:25.200 --> 18:26.700
Okay.

18:26.701 --> 18:28.335
In the next 60 minutes,

18:28.336 --> 18:32.106
Many more men take
the one-degree plunge into pain.

18:32.107 --> 18:33.373
[ groans ]

18:33.374 --> 18:35.409
Okay, done.
excellent.

18:35.410 --> 18:38.212
<i>and some do beat the clock...</i>

18:38.213 --> 18:41.482
And that's it.
that's 3 minutes.

18:41.483 --> 18:42.850
All right.

18:42.851 --> 18:45.285
You can tell by the ice
that's stuck to your forearm.

18:45.286 --> 18:47.254
Okay.

18:47.255 --> 18:51.325
Narrator: ...while others
just seem doomed from the start.

18:51.326 --> 18:53.994
Okay.

18:53.995 --> 18:55.195
Jamie: excellent.

18:55.196 --> 18:56.263
Adam: nicely done.

18:56.264 --> 18:57.965
Watch your step
coming off here.

18:57.966 --> 19:00.467
Narrator: stephen succumbs
to unbearable pain.

19:00.468 --> 19:01.768
Sanjay will take it
from here.

19:01.769 --> 19:02.970
Okay.
thanks for coming in.

19:02.971 --> 19:04.805
Stephen, thank you.
thank you.

19:04.806 --> 19:07.875
Narrator: thanks to all those
who've rolled up their sleeves

19:07.876 --> 19:08.976
For popular science.

19:08.977 --> 19:10.777
Adam's done the arithmetic,

19:10.778 --> 19:13.780
So we won't keep you waiting
on men versus women.

19:13.781 --> 19:15.082
The final figures

19:15.083 --> 19:18.018
Are the average number
of seconds they lasted.

19:19.287 --> 19:20.287
Adam: ta-da!

19:20.288 --> 19:21.655
We have crunched
the numbers

19:21.656 --> 19:22.956
From all our test subjects.

19:22.957 --> 19:24.525
Would you like to know
the result?

19:24.526 --> 19:25.526
Yes.
okay.

19:25.527 --> 19:26.693
Here it comes.

19:26.694 --> 19:27.995
The result is...

19:27.996 --> 19:29.696
Myth confirmed!

19:29.697 --> 19:30.864
Women did, in fact,

19:30.865 --> 19:33.400
Have a reasonably higher
tolerance for pain

19:33.401 --> 19:34.635
Than men in our study.

19:34.636 --> 19:35.802
I'll be darned!

19:35.803 --> 19:37.871
Hah!
in your face, men!

19:37.872 --> 19:38.906
Oh.

19:41.543 --> 19:45.913
Up next, hopes are sky-high
for a real backyard rocket.

19:45.914 --> 19:47.681
Does it look like
it's getting rounder?

19:47.682 --> 19:48.916
[ explosion ]
whoa!                 ohh!
aaaah!

19:54.622 --> 19:57.591
Narrator: tory, grant, and kari
are testing the myth

19:57.592 --> 20:00.260
That a superheated propane tank
could rupture

20:00.261 --> 20:04.932
And take off like a rocket
150 feet in the air.

20:04.933 --> 20:08.135
So far, all they've done
is burn down a shed.

20:08.136 --> 20:12.539
Now it's time to disable
that pesky safety-relief valve

20:12.540 --> 20:14.141
From an empty tank.

20:14.142 --> 20:15.442
So, these propane tanks

20:15.443 --> 20:17.678
Have a lot of safety features
built in,

20:17.679 --> 20:18.979
And they don't want you

20:18.980 --> 20:21.682
To be able to go in
and defeat them,

20:21.683 --> 20:26.453
So us professional yahoos
have to grind our own tools

20:26.454 --> 20:29.823
Because this is
a nonstandard bolt.

20:29.824 --> 20:32.426
So i'm gonna take
this perfectly good wrench

20:32.427 --> 20:34.928
And make it
into a custom removal tool.

20:34.929 --> 20:39.066
Narrator: and that's as much as
we're going to show or explain,

20:39.067 --> 20:42.102
Because trying this yourself
is a reall.bad idea.

20:42.103 --> 20:44.338
Suffice it to say
that before long,

20:44.339 --> 20:46.540
Grant's removed the device
and plugged the hole

20:46.541 --> 20:50.611
To simulate an old tank
with a busted valve.

20:50.612 --> 20:54.081
I've got to say,
with this safety valve disabled,

20:54.082 --> 20:56.683
I see a big boom in our future.

20:58.519 --> 21:00.220
Narrator:
back on the range,

21:00.221 --> 21:04.524
Tory reveals the other major
modification in plan "b."

21:04.525 --> 21:06.026
Instead of burning a shed,

21:06.027 --> 21:08.729
They'll heat
their blocked-up tank

21:08.730 --> 21:11.431
With a portable
propane-gas range.

21:11.432 --> 21:12.666
So, we're setting up a burner,

21:12.667 --> 21:15.602
Attaching a 20-foot hard line
to that,

21:15.603 --> 21:18.372
And then to that, we're gonna
attach a 200-foot line

21:18.373 --> 21:20.707
Down the bomb range
to our feed tank.

21:20.708 --> 21:23.410
Narrator: now,
just so we're all crystal-clear,

21:23.411 --> 21:28.148
This feed tank pumps propane
direct to the burner,

21:28.149 --> 21:30.050
So the flames stay lit.

21:30.051 --> 21:32.853
It's in no way hooked up
to our canister rocket.

21:32.854 --> 21:34.121
A pressure-relief valve,

21:34.122 --> 21:36.189
Which we've dismantled
from this particular tank,

21:36.190 --> 21:38.358
Is there to prevent
a key disaster.

21:38.359 --> 21:39.526
It's called a bleve.

21:39.527 --> 21:40.794
Now, that's an acronym

21:40.795 --> 21:43.430
For "boiling liquid
expanding vapor explosion."

21:43.431 --> 21:47.200
A vessel that has a pressurized
liquid inside, when it ruptures,

21:47.201 --> 21:49.603
Can have a catastrophic
explosion.

21:49.604 --> 21:51.972
Narrator:
they should get their bleve,

21:51.973 --> 21:55.976
But grant doubts he'll witness
the launch of a missile.

21:55.977 --> 21:57.944
The problem is we don't know
where it's gonna rupture.

21:57.945 --> 22:00.314
I think it's gonna rupture
probably on this seam

22:00.315 --> 22:02.149
And go wham!

22:02.150 --> 22:04.184
I still don't think
it's gonna be a rocket.

22:04.185 --> 22:05.919
Narrator:
to find out if he's right,

22:05.920 --> 22:08.188
Tory lights up the stovetop...

22:08.189 --> 22:09.423
Here we go.

22:09.424 --> 22:11.758
...while grant pumps the gas.

22:11.759 --> 22:12.893
Grant: come on!

22:17.265 --> 22:19.066
Kari:
this could be big.

22:19.067 --> 22:20.300
Grant:
it could be really big.

22:20.301 --> 22:21.601
Tory: it's gonna be
a huge fireball.

22:21.602 --> 22:24.404
Or a really awesome
rocket!

22:24.405 --> 22:25.706
Look at the bottom.
it's blackening.

22:25.707 --> 22:30.944
And you can see the blurry
heat fog right above it.

22:30.945 --> 22:32.479
Narrator: 10 minutes in,

22:32.480 --> 22:35.649
This modified tank looks like
it's ready to burst.

22:35.650 --> 22:37.184
Is the tank --

22:37.185 --> 22:39.052
Does it look like
it's getting rounder?

22:39.053 --> 22:41.121
It does.
kari:
yeah, it does, right?

22:42.190 --> 22:44.491
Aaah!
whoa!               ohh!

22:44.492 --> 22:47.794
Well, that wasn't
necessarily a rocket,

22:47.795 --> 22:52.933
Because pieces went that way,
that way, that way, that way.

22:52.934 --> 22:57.304
Narrator: in fact, they went
every which way but vertical.

22:57.305 --> 22:58.772
[ laughing ]

22:58.773 --> 23:00.107
There's a piece
right there!

23:00.108 --> 23:01.508
That was --

23:01.509 --> 23:03.243
No way!

23:03.244 --> 23:05.112
Glad
you're in the bunker, huh?

23:05.113 --> 23:06.546
Wow!
holy crap!

23:06.547 --> 23:09.182
Narrator:
the actual blast was so strong,

23:09.183 --> 23:12.219
It blew out the flame
from the burner.

23:12.220 --> 23:15.489
Some of the shards
flew 300 feet sideways,

23:15.490 --> 23:19.192
But stray bits of metal
do not make a rocket.

23:19.193 --> 23:20.894
So, this is what's left
of our tank,

23:20.895 --> 23:22.996
And it's pretty much
what i expected to happen.

23:22.997 --> 23:26.600
They rupture -- however,
they rupture in random spots.

23:26.601 --> 23:28.602
Kari:
we definitely achieved a bleve.

23:28.603 --> 23:32.305
Our tank ruptured and lost
all of its energy all at once

23:32.306 --> 23:35.075
Rather than any sort
of nozzle-like activity.

23:35.076 --> 23:37.978
Narrator: what we want is a tiny
hole punched through the base

23:37.979 --> 23:41.481
To release all the force
of the pressurized gas.

23:41.482 --> 23:45.685
And if a tank was part rusted
in just the right spot,

23:45.686 --> 23:49.055
There's a good chance
we'd get our rocket.

23:49.056 --> 23:50.857
Oh, i think we could
definitely do that.

23:50.858 --> 23:52.859
Let's go try it.
all right.

23:52.860 --> 23:54.161
So, we're back to the shop.

23:54.162 --> 23:56.229
Now, before we start
weakening these tanks

23:56.230 --> 23:57.998
As if they were
rusty or old tanks,

23:57.999 --> 24:00.100
I need to find out
exactly what i'm up against.

24:00.101 --> 24:02.169
So what i'm gonna do
is cut one of these in half

24:02.170 --> 24:03.970
Just to find out
how thick the wall is,

24:03.971 --> 24:05.138
'cause we want to cut

24:05.139 --> 24:06.907
Halfway through
the thickness of the wall,

24:06.908 --> 24:09.142
Not all the way through
and puncturing it.

24:09.143 --> 24:10.610
Narrator:
ever so carefully...

24:10.611 --> 24:12.245
[ thunk ]

24:12.246 --> 24:14.981
...tory splits the empty tank
in two,

24:14.982 --> 24:17.184
Then pulls out the calipers.

24:17.185 --> 24:21.621
Knowing that the base of this
tank is .083 inches thick,

24:21.622 --> 24:24.090
This is where we want to
weaken the tank

24:24.091 --> 24:27.327
So that this fails before
the rest of the tank ruptures

24:27.328 --> 24:30.530
And hopefully creates a nozzle
through which we get thrust.

24:31.899 --> 24:36.069
Narrator: so grant sets the
drill to just half that depth,

24:36.070 --> 24:39.306
Boring a divot to approximate
a neglected tank

24:39.307 --> 24:42.609
That's part rusted through.

24:42.610 --> 24:44.611
Now it's on to make a rocket.

24:47.081 --> 24:48.715
Kari: all right!

24:48.716 --> 24:50.517
Narrator:
out on the bomb range...

24:50.518 --> 24:52.519
Well, at least
it's not raining.

24:52.520 --> 24:54.521
Oh, dear.

24:54.522 --> 24:56.122
[ coughs ]

24:56.123 --> 25:00.327
Narrator: if this was nasa,
they'd call off the launch.

25:00.328 --> 25:04.097
But perseverance pays off
as the fog soon lifts,

25:04.098 --> 25:06.900
And hopes are high
for a genuine liftoff.

25:06.901 --> 25:08.168
This should be fun.

25:09.604 --> 25:11.071
For this myth to be confirmed,

25:11.072 --> 25:13.306
We're actually gonna have to
propel that tank

25:13.307 --> 25:14.674
150 feet in the air.

25:14.675 --> 25:16.176
That's a 5-gallon tank.

25:16.177 --> 25:18.512
That is gonna take
so much thrust.

25:18.513 --> 25:20.280
[ zip! ]

25:20.281 --> 25:22.249
[ whistle! ]

25:22.250 --> 25:24.451
That's a lot of thrust.

25:24.452 --> 25:25.652
Narrator: once again,

25:25.653 --> 25:27.787
They'll heat the tank
with a propane burner,

25:27.788 --> 25:30.290
And the pressure-relief valve
is blocked off.

25:30.291 --> 25:31.725
Is it good yet?

25:31.726 --> 25:35.061
This will be the ultimate test
of a compromised container.

25:35.062 --> 25:39.266
Now we're ready to see
if a 5-gallon barbecue gas tank

25:39.267 --> 25:40.800
Can really take flight.

25:40.801 --> 25:42.302
Okay, ready to start!

25:42.303 --> 25:43.904
All right, turn it on.

25:45.106 --> 25:46.106
Good.

25:49.710 --> 25:53.680
[ siren wailing ]

25:53.681 --> 25:56.182
Let's see
if we get a rocket.

25:59.186 --> 26:01.221
Kari: i think
it's gonna work this time.

26:01.222 --> 26:03.123
I'm feeling really good
about this experiment.

26:03.124 --> 26:04.524
Yeah,
i feel confident.

26:04.525 --> 26:06.026
That weakening
right on the bottom,

26:06.027 --> 26:08.028
It's in the perfect place
to form a rocket nozzle.

26:08.029 --> 26:09.496
Whatever happens,
it's gonna be spectacular.

26:09.497 --> 26:12.699
Narrator: but it's clear
that they'll have to be patient.

26:12.700 --> 26:14.067
After almost 4 minutes,

26:14.068 --> 26:16.503
The tank isn't bulging
like the last time.

26:17.572 --> 26:18.505
Then...

26:18.506 --> 26:19.506
Kari: i think --

26:19.507 --> 26:21.975
Oh!
oh!                          oh!

26:21.976 --> 26:23.610
I don't think
that was a rocket!

26:23.611 --> 26:25.245
That was absolutely
not a rocket.

26:25.246 --> 26:26.580
It just blew up.

26:26.581 --> 26:30.083
Narrator: once again, the blast
extinguished the burner.

26:30.084 --> 26:32.485
It's a splatter spectacular,

26:32.486 --> 26:34.854
But the myth remains
vertically challenged.

26:34.855 --> 26:37.657
Kari: we got a rupture
that started from the bottom.

26:37.658 --> 26:39.025
It peeled apart the tank,

26:39.026 --> 26:41.161
Threw it
in many different directions,

26:41.162 --> 26:44.364
But nothing
looked like a rocket.

26:44.365 --> 26:48.902
Narrator: it's another
disastrous failure to launch,

26:48.903 --> 26:51.538
But the bit that burst first
went exactly to plan.

26:51.539 --> 26:53.139
Tory: and did you notice
where it ruptured?

26:53.140 --> 26:55.442
I mean, exactly where
we weakened the tank.

26:55.443 --> 26:57.544
Still not a rocket,
but you know what?

26:57.545 --> 26:59.479
Before we give up
on this scenario,

26:59.480 --> 27:00.981
We used a full tank
here.

27:00.982 --> 27:04.050
What if the tank in the garage
was almost empty?

27:04.051 --> 27:05.619
Another explosion?
okay, i'm in.

27:05.620 --> 27:07.253
I'm game.

27:07.254 --> 27:10.090
Narrator:
grant's theory that less is more

27:10.091 --> 27:13.727
Might well be the key to
unleashing the power of propane.

27:13.728 --> 27:16.896
And who can say no
to another explosion?

27:20.434 --> 27:22.235
Straight ahead,

27:22.236 --> 27:25.939
Adam's redheaded peeps are
put to the ultimate pain test.

27:25.940 --> 27:27.374
I hate cold.

27:27.375 --> 27:29.242
Oh, good.

27:35.182 --> 27:37.684
Narrator: so far,
kari, grant, and tory

27:37.685 --> 27:39.819
Have totally failed to confirm
the myth

27:39.820 --> 27:44.357
That a barbecue propane tank
could fly like a rocket.

27:44.358 --> 27:45.992
They've blocked off
the relief valve...

27:45.993 --> 27:47.661
Pieces went that way,
that way...

27:47.662 --> 27:50.664
Narrator:
...then drilled out the bottom
to simulate a rusty tank...

27:50.665 --> 27:52.632
I don't think
that was a rocket.

27:52.633 --> 27:55.201
But grant thinks
the key to success

27:55.202 --> 27:58.138
Is to stop way short
of filling the tank.

27:58.139 --> 28:00.140
Grant: now, a nearly empty
propane tank

28:00.141 --> 28:02.108
Might be the key
to creating a rocket.

28:02.109 --> 28:04.144
Let me illustrate
with this water bottle.

28:04.145 --> 28:07.047
Now, the water in here
represents the liquid propane.

28:07.048 --> 28:08.682
It's incompressible.

28:08.683 --> 28:11.951
There's no room for the gas
to expand and build up pressure.

28:11.952 --> 28:16.022
But if we remove
most of that liquid...

28:17.958 --> 28:19.826
Now we have all of this volume

28:19.827 --> 28:22.629
For the gas to expand
and build up pressure.

28:22.630 --> 28:25.832
An.tha might be
what turns this into a rocket.

28:25.833 --> 28:27.967
Kari:
i'm having a hard time believing

28:27.968 --> 28:30.670
That this is gonna happen
after the last few tests,

28:30.671 --> 28:34.974
<i>but since we ar changing
the circumstances just slightly,</i>

28:34.975 --> 28:37.143
Putting less propane in,

28:37.144 --> 28:39.546
We might have
a different conclusion.

28:39.547 --> 28:41.981
Narrator: this time,
kari does the cooking...

28:41.982 --> 28:43.483
And the running.

28:43.484 --> 28:47.153
[ siren wailing ]

28:47.154 --> 28:50.190
No one knows just what's
gonna happen, or when.

28:50.191 --> 28:53.059
It's starting to look like
it's swelling a little bit.

28:53.060 --> 28:54.961
Well, it's turned
almost completely black.

28:54.962 --> 28:57.030
That's when it exploded
last time.

28:57.031 --> 29:00.133
Propane rocket,
here we go!

29:00.134 --> 29:02.268
Narrator:
and sooner than tory expected...

29:03.604 --> 29:05.438
Kari: oh!
hey!

29:05.439 --> 29:07.440
[ all cheering ]

29:07.441 --> 29:08.742
We got a rocket!

29:08.743 --> 29:10.944
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

29:10.945 --> 29:13.780
That was not 150 feet
in the air.

29:13.781 --> 29:16.316
And it didn't go straight up.
it kind of went bink!

29:16.317 --> 29:18.051
All right,
but you have to admit

29:18.052 --> 29:20.053
That is the best thing
we've seen so far.

29:20.054 --> 29:22.756
Narrator: in fact,
it's the first tank they've seen

29:22.757 --> 29:25.258
<i>that shot up like a missile
an stayed intact.</i>

29:25.259 --> 29:27.694
Kari: we're all incredibly
excited right now.

29:27.695 --> 29:29.763
I mean, we actually created
something

29:29.764 --> 29:31.164
That looked like a rocket.

29:31.165 --> 29:35.235
Narrator: a 60-foot launch
is not the 150 they wanted,

29:35.236 --> 29:39.105
But it's promising
and totally spectacular.

29:39.106 --> 29:41.508
You'd be a brave man
to call this one busted.

29:41.509 --> 29:42.909
Grant:
it's totally plausible.

29:42.910 --> 29:44.577
I mean, it didn't make it
to 150 feet,

29:44.578 --> 29:45.979
But it did look
like a rocket.

29:45.980 --> 29:47.647
This is like
a lot of our myths.

29:47.648 --> 29:49.849
I mean, we have a bizarre set
of circumstances

29:49.850 --> 29:51.718
That gives us
a totally wild outcome.

29:51.719 --> 29:54.020
We didn't get that 150 feet.

29:54.021 --> 29:56.322
What can we do
to make that go 150 feet?

29:57.591 --> 29:59.592
Ooh. [ laughs ]
ooh. [ laughs ]

29:59.593 --> 30:02.495
Narrator: laughter like that
can only mean one thing --

30:02.496 --> 30:07.066
They will do whatever it takes
to match the myth.

30:10.404 --> 30:12.772
You want more?
we've got more.

30:12.773 --> 30:15.909
Log on to
discovery.com/mythbusters

30:15.910 --> 30:17.477
And jump in!

30:21.048 --> 30:24.551
Narrator:
at some point, you've probably
pondered this yourself --

30:24.552 --> 30:28.054
Can some of us tolerate
more pain than others?

30:28.055 --> 30:29.055
[ chuckles ]

30:29.056 --> 30:31.457
Relax. be quiet!

30:31.458 --> 30:35.595
So far, it's hardly been a case
of damsels in distress.

30:35.596 --> 30:40.500
The testing shows women
are clearly more stoic than men.

30:40.501 --> 30:41.734
What's next, adam?

30:41.735 --> 30:44.170
Next is a myth that i take
a little personally,

30:44.171 --> 30:45.338
And it is that redheads

30:45.339 --> 30:47.574
Supposedly have
a lower tolerance for pain

30:47.575 --> 30:49.475
Than regular people.

30:49.476 --> 30:50.677
So, once again,

30:50.678 --> 30:52.979
You get to experience pain
for science, huh?

30:52.980 --> 30:54.547
No. no. no.

30:54.548 --> 30:56.850
I did my duty
walking on hot coals, man.

30:56.851 --> 30:57.951
Phht!

30:57.952 --> 31:00.653
I remember it
like it was yesterday.

31:00.654 --> 31:01.955
This was the time

31:01.956 --> 31:05.325
When the whole team
walked the walk on hot coals,

31:05.326 --> 31:09.395
And the only one to suffer
was our resident redhead.

31:09.396 --> 31:13.433
The rules are exactly the same
as for men versus women,

31:13.434 --> 31:16.536
And it already seems
there's some truth to the rumor.

31:16.537 --> 31:17.770
I hate cold.

31:17.771 --> 31:19.739
[ chuckles ]
oh, good.

31:19.740 --> 31:21.274
[ both laugh ]

31:21.275 --> 31:23.142
Okay.
there we go.

31:23.143 --> 31:24.677
Perfect.

31:24.678 --> 31:28.248
Woman: i've heard that redheads
have a lower tolerance of pain,

31:28.249 --> 31:31.284
But i don't actually know
a large enough sample group

31:31.285 --> 31:34.554
To confirm or deny that,
so we'll see what happens today.

31:34.555 --> 31:35.855
Narrator: we sure will...

31:35.856 --> 31:36.856
Done.

31:36.857 --> 31:38.057
Excellent.

31:38.058 --> 31:40.059
...as two dozen more women...

31:40.060 --> 31:41.928
It's ridiculously
cold.

31:41.929 --> 31:43.463
Isn't it?

31:43.464 --> 31:44.898
...and men...
whenever you're ready.

31:44.899 --> 31:46.032
All right.

31:46.033 --> 31:48.801
...wave the flag
for the redheaded regiment.

31:48.802 --> 31:49.869
Perfect.

31:49.870 --> 31:51.537
Man:
i think it is a myth.

31:51.538 --> 31:54.407
I think we may feel it
faster than other people...

31:54.408 --> 31:56.075
Now it's starting
to hurt.

31:56.076 --> 31:59.078
...but i think we can stand it
just as well, if not better.

31:59.079 --> 32:01.547
And you made it
to 3 minutes.

32:01.548 --> 32:03.182
Out you come.

32:03.183 --> 32:06.686
Narrator:
brian's the first of a small
batch to challenge the myth

32:06.687 --> 32:08.588
That the redheads
can't take it...

32:08.589 --> 32:09.689
You made it 3 minutes.

32:09.690 --> 32:10.757
Done.

32:10.758 --> 32:12.959
Pull your hand out.
excellent work.

32:12.960 --> 32:14.894
Whew!

32:14.895 --> 32:16.462
But they last long enough

32:16.463 --> 32:18.932
To make busting
this part of the myth

32:18.933 --> 32:20.333
A real possibility.

32:20.334 --> 32:21.868
All right, jamie,
it's time for the one

32:21.869 --> 32:23.369
I know that
you've been waiting for --

32:23.370 --> 32:26.639
Redheads
versus non-redheads.

32:26.640 --> 32:29.142
We crunched the numbers.
you want to know the result?

32:29.143 --> 32:31.544
Yes!
okay, here they come.

32:31.545 --> 32:34.580
The myth that redheads have
a lower tolerance for pain is...

32:34.581 --> 32:37.517
Busted -- hugely!

32:37.518 --> 32:39.319
Look at the redheads!

32:39.320 --> 32:41.688
They kicked the butt
of everybody else we tested.

32:41.689 --> 32:43.923
Well, those are your peeps.
are you proud?

32:43.924 --> 32:46.225
I am proud
to be one of them, yes.

32:49.163 --> 32:51.097
Still to come,

32:51.098 --> 32:53.666
Things are looking up
for the propane rocket.

32:53.667 --> 32:55.201
3, 2, 1.

32:55.202 --> 32:56.436
[ explosion ]

32:56.437 --> 33:00.039
And can serious cussing
give sweet relief?

33:00.040 --> 33:02.275
[bleep] [bleep] [bleep]
[bleep] [bleep]

33:06.981 --> 33:09.983
Narrator: the last launch
of the propane-gas tank

33:09.984 --> 33:11.651
Looked close to perfection.

33:11.652 --> 33:16.189
They just couldn't manage
the mythical 150 feet.

33:16.190 --> 33:18.024
So, here's the plan --

33:18.025 --> 33:20.526
To replicate the results
of the myth,

33:20.527 --> 33:23.563
Tory builds a 10-foot
rocket launcher.

33:23.564 --> 33:26.199
He's also come up
with a sure-fire way

33:26.200 --> 33:28.267
To punch out the perfect nozzle.

33:29.636 --> 33:31.838
I've got a 9mm pistol.

33:31.839 --> 33:33.139
It's in a ransom rest,

33:33.140 --> 33:35.575
And it's pointed
at the base of our tank.

33:35.576 --> 33:39.379
Now, that ransom rest
is connected to a window motor.

33:39.380 --> 33:42.482
All i need to do
is run that motor.

33:42.483 --> 33:45.885
It will pull the ransom-rest
lever and fire the gun.

33:45.886 --> 33:49.489
<i>narrator: that's a whole new way
to shoo a rocket.</i>

33:49.490 --> 33:52.258
Back at the range
for the very last time,

33:52.259 --> 33:55.294
Tory's rig is deployed
in a matter of minutes.

33:55.295 --> 33:58.498
But the force of the bullet
remains a concern.

33:58.499 --> 34:01.467
If we shoot all the way through,
making two holes,

34:01.468 --> 34:04.637
All of that pressure is gonna
vent out of the second hole.

34:04.638 --> 34:07.974
So we selected
a small enough caliber handgun

34:07.975 --> 34:09.242
<i>to shoot in,</i>

34:09.243 --> 34:11.043
But it doesn't come out.

34:11.045 --> 34:14.280
Narrator: let's hope
they've guessed right.

34:14.281 --> 34:16.315
Tory: we've taken everything
we've learned

34:16.315 --> 34:18.851
From our previous tests
and applied it to this last one

34:18.851 --> 34:21.054
In order to replicate
the results of the myth.

34:21.054 --> 34:23.389
We got one tank
to go to 60 feet,

34:23.389 --> 34:26.292
But we want our next one
to go to 150 feet.

34:26.293 --> 34:28.860
Narrator: the flares are set
to light the flame

34:28.862 --> 34:30.929
Once grant turns on the gas.

34:30.931 --> 34:33.733
And the gun safely mounted
below the burners

34:33.734 --> 34:37.570
Will eventually be fired
remotely by tory.

34:37.571 --> 34:39.772
This is my favorite part --

34:39.773 --> 34:42.175
Replicating the results.

34:42.176 --> 34:44.476
All right, the gun's live!
the gun's live!

34:44.478 --> 34:46.279
We're on our way.

34:46.280 --> 34:50.083
We have
the best job ever!

34:50.083 --> 34:52.150
[ laughter ]

34:52.152 --> 34:55.688
Narrator: as the flames start
licking the steel,

34:55.688 --> 34:58.658
They figure they've got around
about an 8-minute wait.

34:58.659 --> 35:01.027
Whenever we have to
wait for something to explode,

35:01.028 --> 35:03.162
It seems like time
goes really, really slow.

35:03.163 --> 35:04.730
Tory:
i know, right?

35:04.731 --> 35:05.898
Grant: and hopefully,

35:05.899 --> 35:07.767
That bullet's only gonna
go through the bottom

35:07.768 --> 35:08.868
And give us a nozzle.

35:08.869 --> 35:11.104
Narrator:
so the watch continues

35:11.105 --> 35:15.108
For those telltale signs
of imminent tank failure.

35:15.109 --> 35:17.043
You know what?
i think it's round, dude.

35:17.044 --> 35:21.013
Narrator: if they wait any
longer, the tank might explode,

35:21.014 --> 35:23.015
So it's now or never.

35:23.016 --> 35:24.984
Firing the gun
should breach the bottom

35:24.985 --> 35:26.752
And give them their rocket.

35:26.753 --> 35:29.255
In 3, 2, 1.

35:32.559 --> 35:35.328
[ all cheering ]

35:35.329 --> 35:36.929
It's still spinning!

35:36.930 --> 35:40.533
[ laughter ]

35:40.534 --> 35:43.436
Kari:
that was a brilliant launch,

35:43.437 --> 35:47.807
And the suspense leading up
to it was just a nail-biter.

35:47.808 --> 35:51.811
Narrator: with a perfect
9mm nozzle and a launch tower,

35:51.812 --> 35:54.847
This really was
a proper propane rocket.

35:54.848 --> 35:56.382
And if the tank had fins

35:56.383 --> 35:59.051
To keep its trajectory
straight and true,

35:59.052 --> 36:00.553
Well, who knows?

36:00.554 --> 36:02.288
Kari: when you take it back
to the original myth,

36:02.289 --> 36:03.589
Yes, we did not get
the 150 feet,

36:03.590 --> 36:05.391
But we got something that really
looked like a rocket.

36:05.392 --> 36:06.792
I think
it's still plausible.

36:06.793 --> 36:07.994
I agree -- plausible.

36:07.995 --> 36:09.395
Plausible.

36:09.396 --> 36:11.697
Under the perfect storm
of conditions,

36:11.698 --> 36:13.900
I think you could
get a rocket.

36:24.845 --> 36:29.815
Narrator: adam and jamie have
already taken one for the team,

36:29.816 --> 36:31.450
Then tortured some strangers

36:31.451 --> 36:34.687
To find out if some folk
cope better with pain.

36:35.689 --> 36:36.923
All right.

36:36.924 --> 36:38.391
So what's next?

36:38.392 --> 36:40.293
Well, allow me
to demonstrate.

36:41.195 --> 36:43.196
[bleep] ow!

36:43.197 --> 36:45.565
Question -- did swearing
make that hurt less?

36:45.566 --> 36:46.632
I don't know!

36:46.633 --> 36:48.401
Well,
that's our next myth --

36:48.402 --> 36:51.070
Does swearing increase
your tolerance to pain?

36:51.071 --> 36:54.240
Aah!

36:54.241 --> 36:56.175
It's a fair enough question,

36:56.176 --> 36:59.912
But testing it out
poses obvious problems.

36:59.913 --> 37:02.381
We've cursed on the show
before, plenty.

37:02.382 --> 37:03.683
But what you may not know

37:03.684 --> 37:05.818
Is that not only do they bleep
the sound of our curses,

37:05.819 --> 37:07.954
But often if our mouth
is visible during a curse,

37:07.955 --> 37:09.722
They blur it
so you can't read our lips

37:09.723 --> 37:11.757
And see what nasty things
are coming out of us.

37:11.758 --> 37:15.795
And every time they have to blur
it, it costs a lot of money.

37:15.796 --> 37:18.931
So i figure i'm going to do the
editors a favor for this myth

37:18.932 --> 37:20.700
And actually make a piece
of headgear

37:20.701 --> 37:22.034
Which blurs my mouth for them,

37:22.035 --> 37:23.769
Then all they have to do
is a bleep,

37:23.770 --> 37:24.971
And bleeps are cheap.

37:24.972 --> 37:27.073
All right,
here goes the first test.

37:28.842 --> 37:32.678
Initiating the curse-proof tool.

37:32.679 --> 37:34.013
How about this?

37:34.014 --> 37:37.283
[bleeping]

37:37.284 --> 37:40.019
...eating [bleep]

37:40.020 --> 37:42.088
No blurring for the editors!

37:42.089 --> 37:43.723
[ laughs ]

37:43.724 --> 37:45.925
Given that this setup
is all the same,

37:45.926 --> 37:49.161
How is this test any different
than the others?

37:49.162 --> 37:53.032
For this test,
our sample size will be five,

37:53.033 --> 37:55.401
Except instead of averaging
our data

37:55.402 --> 37:57.270
Across all five test subjects,

37:57.271 --> 38:00.806
In this test, each subject will
be compared to themselves.

38:00.807 --> 38:03.309
In order to isolate the act
of swearing

38:03.310 --> 38:04.877
From the act of speaking,

38:04.878 --> 38:07.113
Our test subjects
are going to be repeating

38:07.114 --> 38:09.548
A number of non-swear words
over and over again

38:09.549 --> 38:12.184
While they're undergoing
the test.

38:12.185 --> 38:16.155
Narrator:
kari, tory, and grant are
sworn in to make up the five.

38:16.156 --> 38:18.624
Now, this is a test
in two parts --

38:18.625 --> 38:22.728
First, the control, where they
preselect ordinary words

38:22.729 --> 38:24.864
To scream out when it hurts.

38:24.865 --> 38:31.037
Okay, there are your words --
five non-swear words.

38:31.038 --> 38:32.905
Narrator: first, grant...

38:32.906 --> 38:34.707
Ohh.

38:34.708 --> 38:35.875
Narrator:
...and then kari...

38:35.876 --> 38:36.909
Ohh!

38:36.910 --> 38:38.311
Oho-ho!

38:38.312 --> 38:40.913
...hang on as long as they can.

38:40.914 --> 38:41.914
Doughnut!

38:41.915 --> 38:42.915
Fudge!

38:42.916 --> 38:43.916
Blueberry!

38:43.917 --> 38:45.184
Sugar.

38:45.185 --> 38:46.185
Schnitzel!

38:46.186 --> 38:47.186
Goodness.

38:47.187 --> 38:48.587
Piston!

38:48.588 --> 38:52.658
But both fall way short
of the 3-minute limit.

38:52.659 --> 38:54.393
I think that's it.
that's -- gah!

38:54.394 --> 38:56.162
Ohh!

38:56.163 --> 38:58.064
Okay, i'm getting
tunnel vision.

38:58.065 --> 39:00.366
I really can't last
that long.

39:00.367 --> 39:02.234
[ sighs ]

39:02.235 --> 39:05.638
Adam's the next one
to chance his arm...

39:05.639 --> 39:07.306
Puppies! kittens!

39:07.307 --> 39:09.275
Babies! ducklings!

39:09.276 --> 39:10.976
Oh, baby hippo!

39:10.977 --> 39:14.113
But again, he can't last
more than a minute.

39:14.114 --> 39:16.282
Puppies! puppies!
kittens! kittens!

39:16.283 --> 39:17.350
Baby hippos!

39:17.351 --> 39:19.352
Babies! ducklings!

39:19.353 --> 39:20.786
Aah!

39:20.787 --> 39:25.858
The next man to try to maintain
some control is tory.

39:25.859 --> 39:27.827
In 3, 2, 1.

39:28.962 --> 39:32.064
Gosh dang it, it's cold!

39:32.065 --> 39:35.000
Cold!

39:35.001 --> 39:38.070
[bleeping]

39:38.071 --> 39:41.006
Tory's jumped the gun
with his potty mouth.

39:41.007 --> 39:44.910
Tory: on a scale of 1 to 10,
i think i peaked out about 15.

39:44.911 --> 39:48.080
Narrator: and then he finds out
he's in double trouble.

39:48.081 --> 39:49.815
Oh, my god,
it's completely numb.

39:49.816 --> 39:52.985
Tory, thanks
for participating,

39:52.986 --> 39:55.788
But unfortunately we have to
disqualify you.

39:55.789 --> 39:57.223
Why?

39:57.224 --> 39:59.625
Number one, you actually swore
during the test,

39:59.626 --> 40:01.394
Which is what the test
is about,

40:01.395 --> 40:03.129
And you weren't
supposed to swear,

40:03.130 --> 40:05.064
So you're out
because of that,

40:05.065 --> 40:07.133
And you also lasted
past the 3 minutes.

40:07.134 --> 40:09.201
It could have been
because of the swearing.

40:09.202 --> 40:10.202
We don't know.

40:10.203 --> 40:11.504
So i'm done
getting tortured

40:11.505 --> 40:13.105
Is basically
what you're telling me?

40:13.106 --> 40:14.206
Yeah.

40:14.207 --> 40:16.342
But can jamie do better?

40:16.343 --> 40:18.711
We're about to find out.

40:18.712 --> 40:20.112
Fudge!

40:20.113 --> 40:21.847
Fish!

40:21.848 --> 40:23.048
Lightning!

40:23.049 --> 40:24.283
Hasenpfeffer!

40:24.284 --> 40:26.485
Sure enough,
he muddies the icy waters

40:26.486 --> 40:28.387
By going the distance.

40:28.388 --> 40:30.122
Jamie:
if you outlast the first test,

40:30.123 --> 40:32.525
That automatically disqualifies
you for the second one

40:32.526 --> 40:36.796
Because there's no improvement
to be made.

40:36.797 --> 40:39.799
I did, and so i'm out.

40:39.800 --> 40:43.335
Narrator: so we need two
replacements for jamie and tory.

40:43.336 --> 40:46.372
Staffers will and yvette
both take the test,

40:46.373 --> 40:48.908
And qualify
to fill out the quorum.

40:48.909 --> 40:51.577
Now for the pg part
of the program,

40:51.578 --> 40:54.447
As adam fits grant
with the swear guard.

40:54.448 --> 40:55.548
That's fantastic!

40:55.549 --> 40:56.615
Yeah.
okay.

40:56.616 --> 40:58.217
Go do the test.
all right.

40:58.218 --> 41:00.619
See you later [bleep]

41:00.620 --> 41:02.521
<i>this will sully grant's image,</i>

41:02.522 --> 41:05.624
But remember --
it's all in the name of science.

41:05.625 --> 41:08.661
[bleeping]

41:08.662 --> 41:11.430
They start to lose meaning
after a while.

41:11.431 --> 41:13.833
Oh [bleeping]

41:13.834 --> 41:14.934
Ow!

41:14.935 --> 41:16.469
Okay. aah!

41:16.470 --> 41:17.570
Aah.

41:17.571 --> 41:18.671
Crap!

41:18.672 --> 41:20.973
Will and yvette
continue the blue streak.

41:20.974 --> 41:23.008
Then sweet kari steps up,

41:23.009 --> 41:27.012
Primed with words that would
shock a longshoreman.

41:27.013 --> 41:29.315
Oh, my god!

41:29.316 --> 41:32.117
[bleeping]

41:34.888 --> 41:37.556
It actually seems to be working

41:37.557 --> 41:39.625
As kari goes on
to beat the clock.

41:39.626 --> 41:41.393
[bleep]

41:41.394 --> 41:44.463
And the last one to hope
that his mother's not watching

41:44.464 --> 41:45.397
Is adam.

41:45.398 --> 41:46.899
All right,
five dirty words.

41:46.900 --> 41:48.267
Here they come.

41:48.268 --> 41:51.904
Now let's see if some cussing
makes adam last longer.

41:51.905 --> 41:53.339
Here we go!

41:53.340 --> 41:55.407
3, 2 [bleep]

41:55.408 --> 41:57.142
1.

41:57.143 --> 41:59.178
All right!

41:59.179 --> 42:01.647
[bleep] [bleep]

42:01.648 --> 42:03.682
Oh, my god!
[bleep]

42:03.683 --> 42:06.218
Hard to say
if the swearing is helping

42:06.219 --> 42:08.420
As adam pulls out
at just under a minute.

42:08.421 --> 42:10.489
[bleep] [bleep]

42:10.490 --> 42:11.557
There we go!

42:11.558 --> 42:12.558
[bleep]

42:12.559 --> 42:13.959
[ laughs ]

42:13.960 --> 42:15.294
Oh!

42:15.295 --> 42:17.363
I got to stop! oh!

42:17.364 --> 42:18.898
[bleep]

42:18.899 --> 42:20.933
Once he's tallied the timings,

42:20.934 --> 42:22.935
Jamie rolls out the stats
on the swearing.

42:25.872 --> 42:28.107
Everybody was
on the plus side.
indeed.

42:28.108 --> 42:31.810
And the average increase
is 30%.

42:31.811 --> 42:33.045
Wow!

42:33.046 --> 42:34.813
It is incredible.

42:34.814 --> 42:36.782
[bleep]
shouting obscenities,

42:36.783 --> 42:38.517
Compared to non-cuss words...

42:38.518 --> 42:39.552
Fish!

42:39.553 --> 42:41.620
...actually increased,
on average,

42:41.621 --> 42:44.623
Their tolerance to pain
by a whopping 30%.

42:44.624 --> 42:47.760
But remember, kids,
like we always say --

42:47.761 --> 42:49.428
Don't try this at home.

42:49.429 --> 42:51.931
[bleep]
oh, sweet relief.

42:51.932 --> 42:53.832
So, where do we stand?

42:53.833 --> 42:55.167
Well, let's go down the list.

42:55.168 --> 42:56.302
Number one, the myth

42:56.303 --> 42:58.938
That women have a higher
pain tolerance than men.

42:58.939 --> 43:00.306
Turns out to be true.
yep.

43:00.307 --> 43:02.641
Number two, the myth
that redheads

43:02.642 --> 43:05.711
Have a lower pain tolerance
than regular people.

43:05.712 --> 43:07.813
Surprisingly,
that's busted.

43:07.814 --> 43:09.181
And finally, the myth

43:09.182 --> 43:12.151
That cursing increases
one's tolerance for pain.

43:12.152 --> 43:13.953
That would be confirmed.

43:13.954 --> 43:16.288
While experiencing some
of that pain may have sucked,

43:16.289 --> 43:18.991
I'm actually quite pleased with
how definitive our results are.

43:18.992 --> 43:20.526
Well, you know
what they say.

43:20.527 --> 43:22.494
What?
no pain, no gain.

43:22.495 --> 43:24.129
[ laughs ]

43:24.130 --> 43:25.197
[ laughs ]
