WEBVTT

00:07.517 --> 00:08.862
How about this one?

00:22.068 --> 00:23.137
Louis, when you die,

00:23.275 --> 00:25.724
you're gonna have
to stand before God.

00:25.862 --> 00:27.275
What are you gonna tell him?
Nothing.

00:27.413 --> 00:29.344
He's gonna drop-kick
your ass to hell.

00:29.482 --> 00:33.793
Louis, Louis, Louis, Louis,
Louis, Louis's heart.

00:33.931 --> 00:35.241
Louis, Louis.

00:38.275 --> 00:40.931
Your vibe is very odd.

00:42.482 --> 00:46.448
- God hates America!

00:46.586 --> 00:50.310
America is dead!

00:50.448 --> 00:53.172
- One of the most notorious
hate groups in America,

00:53.310 --> 00:56.448
the Westboro Baptist Church,
is a Christian ministry that,

00:56.586 --> 00:59.586
for years, has preached a
virulently anti-gay message

00:59.724 --> 01:03.275
at funerals
and high-profile events.

01:03.413 --> 01:05.344
You angered the Lord your God,

01:05.482 --> 01:07.482
and now he's cursed your family.

01:07.620 --> 01:09.793
There's no consolation there.

01:09.931 --> 01:13.000
- In 2006, and again in 2010,

01:13.137 --> 01:15.310
I visited them in Topeka,
Kansas,

01:15.448 --> 01:18.241
discovering a world
of indoctrination,

01:18.379 --> 01:21.206
masterminded by church founder
Fred Phelps,

01:21.344 --> 01:24.137
known by family members
as "Gramps".

01:24.275 --> 01:26.172
- It's almost 18 months
now,

01:26.310 --> 01:28.827
and the siege has got people
eating their babies...

01:30.758 --> 01:33.517
and their small children,
and each other!

01:33.655 --> 01:36.620
You're gonna eat your babies!

01:36.758 --> 01:40.862
- But Fred Phelps's death in
2014 had shaken up the church,

01:41.000 --> 01:44.206
and a long-devoted member
had defected and gone public.

01:44.344 --> 01:46.551
You know,
we claimed to love people.

01:46.689 --> 01:48.965
This was the biggest
contradiction of all, I think.

01:49.103 --> 01:51.689
And I was totally blind to it.

01:51.827 --> 01:55.931
- Now, embarrassing secrets
were said to be coming out.

01:56.068 --> 02:00.448
So I was back with America's
most hated family.

02:00.586 --> 02:02.413
Did you picket Gramps's funeral?

02:02.551 --> 02:04.517
He went from dead to the ground

02:04.655 --> 02:07.586
as fast as we could
possibly get him there.

02:07.724 --> 02:11.793
In a place where no one
will be able to find him.

02:11.931 --> 02:14.310
Now, how do you like
that awesomeness?

02:29.275 --> 02:30.965
- In Kansas City,
Missouri,

02:31.103 --> 02:34.551
15 or so Westboro members
were outside the Sprint Center,

02:34.689 --> 02:37.275
protesting college basketball.

02:38.448 --> 02:40.206
- Who's this kid's mother?

02:40.344 --> 02:43.517
Holy [bleep] shit!
You guys are pricks!

02:44.586 --> 02:47.344
Get a life, get a [bleep] life!

02:47.482 --> 02:49.206
Holy shit!

02:49.344 --> 02:51.965
- The church views
pastimes like basketball

02:52.103 --> 02:53.379
as false idols.

02:53.517 --> 02:55.655
- When you place something
above Christ,

02:55.793 --> 02:57.517
like this filthy piece of silk

02:57.655 --> 02:59.862
that represents
a nation awash in sin,

03:00.000 --> 03:01.517
you're an idolater.

03:04.758 --> 03:06.896
- Pickets are
an opportunity for Westboro

03:07.034 --> 03:09.000
to spread its hateful message,

03:09.137 --> 03:11.758
and also to indoctrinate
its own membership.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.448
For them,
the outrage they provoke

03:14.586 --> 03:17.620
is a sign that they
are doing God's work.

03:17.758 --> 03:20.758
If a guy likes another guy,
who the fuck cares?

03:20.896 --> 03:23.896
Let 'em do them,
let 'em do them.

03:24.034 --> 03:26.241
- Among those present
was the granddaughter

03:26.379 --> 03:28.413
of church founder, Fred Phelps,

03:28.551 --> 03:31.137
14-year-old
Bethany Hockenbarger.

03:31.275 --> 03:34.862
Can I talk to you?
Tell me about your sign.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.137
- This is actually my favourite
sign I request every time.

03:38.275 --> 03:42.655
Because when Satan whispered
in Eve's ear to sin,

03:42.793 --> 03:46.034
he made them realise
what they were doing wrong

03:46.172 --> 03:49.689
and they disobeyed God,
and that was their sins.

03:49.827 --> 03:52.827
And who are you talking to
in that sign?

03:52.965 --> 03:56.103
Everyone is prone to sin,

03:56.241 --> 03:58.896
and unless you have God's grace,

03:59.034 --> 04:01.655
you aren't gonna go to heaven,
you're gonna go to hell.

04:01.793 --> 04:03.137
Do you worry about going
to hell?

04:03.275 --> 04:04.793
- All the time, yeah.
- Do you?

04:04.931 --> 04:06.689
- Yes.
- What do you think it's like?

04:08.275 --> 04:10.344
It's obviously fire,

04:10.482 --> 04:12.724
and there's obviously
a lot of people

04:12.862 --> 04:14.586
that are also gonna be there.

04:14.724 --> 04:17.344
You're in pain
for eternity, basically?

04:17.482 --> 04:20.275
- Yes.
- How's school going?

04:20.413 --> 04:24.482
Good. I have a choir concert
coming up pretty soon, so...

04:24.620 --> 04:26.448
- What are you singing
in the choir?

04:26.586 --> 04:28.344
- A couple of Police songs,

04:28.482 --> 04:30.000
a couple of Michael Jackson
songs.

04:30.137 --> 04:33.965
- Wait, hang on...
- Yeah, that's what I said!

04:34.758 --> 04:35.862
- Because you have a...

04:36.000 --> 04:37.931
- There was also
a new family.

04:38.068 --> 04:40.068
Chris Jakes
and four of his children

04:40.206 --> 04:43.896
had joined four years earlier,
leaving behind a wife and mother

04:44.034 --> 04:47.103
to start a new life
inside Westboro.

04:47.241 --> 04:49.137
- What's your name?
- Daniel Jakes.

04:49.275 --> 04:50.827
- Daniel Jakes.
- Yeah.

04:50.965 --> 04:54.689
This is my brother Josh,
and this is my sister Julie.

04:54.827 --> 04:56.551
- Tell me about your sign?

04:56.689 --> 04:58.896
- You know, this is one
of our more famous ones,

04:59.034 --> 05:01.103
particularly "God Hates Fags".

05:01.241 --> 05:02.655
But I like this one
'cause it says,

05:02.793 --> 05:04.413
"God Still Hates Fags".

05:04.551 --> 05:07.103
God hasn't changed,
he's not going to.

05:07.241 --> 05:08.689
You know, staying the same.

05:08.827 --> 05:10.517
- How long have you been here?

05:10.655 --> 05:13.206
- Four years,
three and a half years or so.

05:13.344 --> 05:16.448
- So you would've been how old
when you came, like 10?

05:16.586 --> 05:19.758
- No, I'm 17 now,
so I was 13, 12.

05:19.896 --> 05:22.275
Were your parents divorced
when you came here?

05:22.413 --> 05:23.517
No, they were not.

05:23.655 --> 05:25.620
- And do you miss your mum
at all?

05:25.758 --> 05:29.586
- Uh, I mean... not really.

05:29.724 --> 05:31.586
And I know that sounds
a little weird,

05:31.724 --> 05:33.896
and I don't have
a hatred for her.

05:34.034 --> 05:36.724
I think the Lord has
really helped me with that,

05:36.862 --> 05:41.068
because, you know,
my mom claims she loves me.

05:41.206 --> 05:43.068
According to God's standards
she hates me,

05:43.206 --> 05:45.275
- she doesn't love me at all.
- What do you mean? She...

05:45.413 --> 05:47.655
She doesn't love me because she
doesn't tell me the truth.

05:47.793 --> 05:49.551
- Which is?
- Which is that

05:49.689 --> 05:51.827
if I don't obey God,
I'm gonna go to hell.

05:53.172 --> 05:54.620
Sex!

05:58.137 --> 05:59.931
- I was back spending time
at Westboro,

06:00.068 --> 06:02.896
hoping to find out how the death
of its founder and leader,

06:03.034 --> 06:06.172
Pastor Fred Phelps,
had affected the church.

06:12.586 --> 06:14.103
Notoriously tight-knit,

06:14.241 --> 06:16.862
most of the church members
come from a single family,

06:17.000 --> 06:20.448
the Phelps, and live on
one block in Topeka, Kansas.

06:23.896 --> 06:25.551
The chapel
is in the same building

06:25.689 --> 06:28.137
where Pastor Phelps,
or "Gramps", once lived,

06:28.275 --> 06:30.620
across the street
from The Rainbow House,

06:30.758 --> 06:32.517
a pro-gay rights charity.

06:37.103 --> 06:39.344
One of the few members who isn't
part of the Phelps family

06:39.482 --> 06:41.000
is Steve Drain.

06:42.000 --> 06:42.965
Where are we going?

06:43.103 --> 06:44.896
- We're gonna go
to the video newsroom.

06:45.034 --> 06:47.655
- Steve first came
as a documentary maker.

06:47.793 --> 06:50.103
He was so impressed,
he decided to join up,

06:50.241 --> 06:52.827
bringing his family with him.

06:52.965 --> 06:55.103
- Would I be right in
thinking it was here

06:55.241 --> 06:58.310
that I saw Gramps during
his video preaching?

06:58.448 --> 07:01.137
- Do you remember 13 years ago?
- I do remember that.

07:01.275 --> 07:04.620
- It was probably as new to you
as it was to me in those days.

07:07.965 --> 07:09.689
- Hi, guys.
- How do you do?

07:10.862 --> 07:12.241
- I'm Louis.
- Hi, Louis.

07:12.379 --> 07:13.724
- From the BBC.
- Yes.

07:13.862 --> 07:15.448
- You must be
Pastor Fred Phelps.

07:15.586 --> 07:17.000
- Yes.
- Very pleased to meet you.

07:17.137 --> 07:18.862
Glad to see you, Louis.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.068
Pay attention,
pay close attention.

07:22.206 --> 07:25.965
Billy Graham,
hell-bound false prophet.

07:26.103 --> 07:31.034
Billy, you are headed straight
and irreversibly for hell.

07:31.172 --> 07:35.793
You are a lying, money-grubbing
Arminian heretic.

07:35.931 --> 07:42.724
At 88, Graham will soon die,
and split hell wide open.

07:42.862 --> 07:48.275
And Westboro Baptist Church will
picket your funeral. Amen.

07:49.482 --> 07:51.448
- After Pastor Phelps's death,

07:51.586 --> 07:53.448
his place had been taken
by a counsel

07:53.586 --> 07:57.241
of seven elders, all male,
of which Steve was one.

07:58.448 --> 07:59.931
- Can you hear me OK?

08:00.068 --> 08:04.034
I can hear you. OK.
Here we go.

08:04.172 --> 08:06.241
Greetings. The word of God
is clear

08:06.379 --> 08:09.241
on what makes a nation wicked
in his eyes.

08:09.379 --> 08:10.620
Mr. President,

08:10.758 --> 08:13.862
will you not ask the Lord
to strip you of your pride,

08:14.000 --> 08:17.310
greed and vanity,
and repent of that folly,

08:17.448 --> 08:20.448
and ask the Lord to cause
you to, humbly yet boldly,

08:20.586 --> 08:22.689
speak his truth
to this whole round world

08:22.827 --> 08:25.862
while you still have
this considerable platform?

08:26.000 --> 08:28.724
We're commanded to love
our neighbours as ourselves.

08:28.862 --> 08:32.517
Fear God and keep
his commandments. Amen.

08:32.655 --> 08:34.241
Did that camera bounce much?

08:34.379 --> 08:36.482
- No, but I had some audio blip.
- Really?

08:36.620 --> 08:38.758
But I wanna check the mic
before we keep going.

08:38.896 --> 08:40.310
- OK.
- 'Cause it cut out

08:40.448 --> 08:41.896
a lot at the end.

08:42.034 --> 08:43.448
So it's a reasonable...

08:43.586 --> 08:47.241
Compared with the rhetoric,
the way it used to be.

08:47.379 --> 08:51.655
You're more liable
to remind people

08:51.793 --> 08:55.068
of the route to salvation.

08:55.206 --> 08:58.482
You're either the quickest
study in the history of man,

08:58.620 --> 09:02.379
or you already kinda came here
with what you thought this was.

09:02.517 --> 09:04.689
I... It's based on
what I'm seeing, really.

09:04.827 --> 09:06.586
And I don't mean it
as a criticism.

09:06.724 --> 09:08.689
It feels like a softening
or a declination

09:08.827 --> 09:11.344
from how maybe Gramps
would've spoken it.

09:11.482 --> 09:14.862
I think that it has
more to do with...

09:15.000 --> 09:17.655
growth and maturity
than anything else.

09:17.793 --> 09:19.551
Donald Trump,

09:19.689 --> 09:22.206
you're gonna split hell
wide open when you die,

09:22.344 --> 09:25.448
and Westboro Baptist Church
will picket your funeral.

09:25.586 --> 09:27.827
That's not even close.

09:27.965 --> 09:30.586
- A good try.

09:36.482 --> 09:38.655
- Though there are usually
one or two departures

09:38.793 --> 09:41.310
from Westboro each year,
the numbers at the church

09:41.448 --> 09:45.034
have remained the same,
hovering around 70.

09:45.172 --> 09:47.172
Most of the new membership
comes from children

09:47.310 --> 09:48.724
born into the group.

09:48.862 --> 09:50.310
- Hello there.
- Hi.

09:50.448 --> 09:51.689
How's it going?

09:51.827 --> 09:53.517
Among those who'd had children
since my last visit

09:53.655 --> 09:54.620
was Jael Phelps.

09:54.758 --> 09:55.793
- Good to see you.
- Hi.

09:55.931 --> 09:57.068
How you doing? Can we come in?

09:57.206 --> 09:58.482
When I'd first met Jael,

09:58.620 --> 10:00.655
we'd talked about
her marriage prospects.

10:00.793 --> 10:03.137
- This our...
the computer study area.

10:03.275 --> 10:06.034
It's not sinful
to get married, is it?

10:06.172 --> 10:08.655
And if you wanted to do that
then how do you do that?

10:08.793 --> 10:11.655
Well, first of all, I don't
think that's ever gonna happen.

10:11.793 --> 10:13.655
- Why wouldn't that happen?
- Are you kidding me?

10:13.793 --> 10:15.034
Are you kidding me?

10:15.172 --> 10:18.275
Because I'm Jael Phelps,
and I serve God, that's why.

10:20.103 --> 10:22.310
This used to be your room,
didn't it?

10:22.448 --> 10:25.103
- I remember you showing me.
- Yeah.

10:27.862 --> 10:29.931
So cute. Whose room is this?

10:30.068 --> 10:31.413
- Silas's.

10:31.551 --> 10:33.551
- I can tell it's Silas's room
'cause it has

10:33.689 --> 10:36.103
so many baby-appropriate
things on the walls.

10:36.241 --> 10:38.551
- Yeah!

10:38.689 --> 10:40.862
- Yeah, he's being sarcastic,
darling.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
- Will you change the walls,

10:42.137 --> 10:44.310
or are you gonna
keep the walls like this?

10:44.448 --> 10:46.448
Or have you just not
got round to it yet?

10:46.586 --> 10:48.655
- No, no, no,
this is intentional.

10:48.793 --> 10:50.068
Why?

10:50.206 --> 10:51.310
- This is one of my
favourite rooms in the house.

10:51.448 --> 10:54.862
I think it's a place
to teach the children,

10:55.000 --> 10:57.965
and children
are concrete learners.

10:58.103 --> 10:59.965
They're not, you know...

11:00.103 --> 11:02.137
- Theoretical stuff...
- Abstract, yeah sure.

11:02.275 --> 11:04.034
Yeah, abstract stuff's gonna
be over their heads, so...

11:04.172 --> 11:06.482
- And in a way,
what I would agree with

11:06.620 --> 11:12.482
is a tiny baby like Silas,
it'll be lost on him,

11:12.620 --> 11:15.655
what this means.
So maybe that's good.

11:15.793 --> 11:17.758
'Cause actually a baby
doesn't need to be thinking

11:17.896 --> 11:19.310
- about hell the whole time.
- Right.

11:19.448 --> 11:22.103
- But do you think
you have this up maybe

11:22.241 --> 11:24.655
- for the older ones too?
- Yeah.

11:24.793 --> 11:27.379
I think these are wonderful
works of God, they're amazing,

11:27.517 --> 11:31.137
and they strike awe, you know,
some of these things.

11:31.275 --> 11:32.724
And so, yeah...

11:34.862 --> 11:36.655
- Well, that made
a lot more sense

11:36.793 --> 11:38.517
than what your mum just said.

11:43.758 --> 11:46.241
- Against the odds,
Jael had found someone

11:46.379 --> 11:48.206
from an unlikely place.

11:50.068 --> 11:52.344
- If you listen to
the millions of Brits,

11:52.482 --> 11:56.103
it's just amazing how detached
from reality they really are.

11:56.241 --> 11:58.206
The reality is Britain
is broken.

11:58.344 --> 12:01.965
- Steven Holroyd from Bradford
had joined in 2011,

12:02.103 --> 12:03.206
becoming another face

12:03.344 --> 12:05.931
in Westboro's online ministry
of hate,

12:06.068 --> 12:08.344
denouncing a culture
he viewed as decadent

12:08.482 --> 12:10.827
and taking aim
at gay celebrities.

12:10.965 --> 12:12.620
- What does that say
for a nation

12:12.758 --> 12:15.448
when they exalt a sodomite
like Elton John

12:15.586 --> 12:18.896
and call him "Sir",
how disgusting can you get?

12:19.034 --> 12:20.965
God hates the UK.

12:23.620 --> 12:25.103
- So, to get this
out of the way,

12:25.241 --> 12:27.689
how does a young man
from Bradford

12:27.827 --> 12:30.517
come to be a member of
the Westboro Baptist Church?

12:31.931 --> 12:35.137
- He was shown
some things by God.

12:35.275 --> 12:36.448
Right.

12:36.586 --> 12:39.000
- And I'd seen
your documentary,

12:39.137 --> 12:43.448
I'd also seen Jeremy Kyle's deal
with Shirl and Becca.

12:43.586 --> 12:44.689
- And thought what?

12:44.827 --> 12:46.517
Because most people
saw those appearances

12:46.655 --> 12:48.310
and thought,
"Wow, those guys are crazy!"

12:48.448 --> 12:50.448
- Right.
- But you didn't think that.

12:50.586 --> 12:53.137
It was impressive
to see that they knew

12:53.275 --> 12:55.448
what Bible verses
were being referenced.

12:55.586 --> 12:58.931
I was impressed by that,
so I wanted to learn more.

12:59.068 --> 13:00.862
- So then you had
your visit, and then,

13:01.000 --> 13:03.103
at the end of that,
you thought what?

13:03.241 --> 13:06.586
- Steve said,
"Why go back to Yorkshire?"

13:06.724 --> 13:09.965
And I felt that was
a good question.

13:10.103 --> 13:11.758
- Jael, I don't wanna put
you on the spot,

13:11.896 --> 13:14.586
but how did you realise
that there were feelings

13:14.724 --> 13:16.172
growing between you?

13:16.310 --> 13:19.931
I felt like he was humble,
and that he was modest,

13:20.068 --> 13:21.896
and that he wanted to do
the right thing.

13:22.034 --> 13:27.379
So I felt that it would be a
good person to sojourn with,

13:27.517 --> 13:30.310
and we could help one another.

13:30.448 --> 13:33.586
Serve the Lord together,
so yeah,

13:33.724 --> 13:35.448
I think that's my answer.

13:36.931 --> 13:40.344
- It's not the stuff
of a Hollywood rom-com.

13:40.482 --> 13:42.689
It was very Jane Austen,

13:42.827 --> 13:46.758
if I can put it that way.
All proper and appropriate.

13:46.896 --> 13:50.137
- I never thought that
I was cut out for this.

13:51.586 --> 13:55.827
I saw myself as single
for life, no question.

13:55.965 --> 13:58.206
- Did you? How come?

13:58.344 --> 14:01.137
Never had any experience
with kids.

14:01.275 --> 14:03.689
I was never around girls really.

14:03.827 --> 14:05.655
You weren't a sort of party
boy?

14:05.793 --> 14:06.862
- Nope.

14:13.827 --> 14:15.965
This was our first impression
of Matthias.

14:16.103 --> 14:18.655
Oh, OK, this is old-school Matt.

14:18.793 --> 14:22.758
Wow. You look like a
'Wallace and Gromit' character.

14:22.896 --> 14:24.827
He kind of does, I can see that!

14:24.965 --> 14:27.344
I had just worked a night shift.
I was tired.

14:27.482 --> 14:30.068
There we go.
We'll just go with that.

14:30.206 --> 14:31.827
- That's nice.
What year is this?

14:31.965 --> 14:34.000
- 20...
- 2012.

14:34.137 --> 14:36.896
- And so you're just
clowning around in this one.

14:37.034 --> 14:39.482
- And you got married here,
I take it, in the chapel?

14:39.620 --> 14:41.310
- Yes.
- Who officiated?

14:41.448 --> 14:42.482
Gramps.

14:42.620 --> 14:44.758
- And the Bible's
quite traditional,

14:44.896 --> 14:47.586
obviously, in the matter of...

14:47.724 --> 14:49.655
the man's kind of in charge,
wouldn't you say?

14:49.793 --> 14:52.931
- Yeah. He dictates what
the law of the home is,

14:53.068 --> 14:56.448
and the wife
is to carry that out.

14:56.586 --> 14:58.965
Just as Jesus Christ is
in charge of the church.

14:59.103 --> 15:00.379
- Mmm.
- Yes.

15:02.862 --> 15:04.862
- Steven had been
re-christened "Matthias"

15:05.000 --> 15:07.896
but in his old life,
he'd been a postal worker.

15:08.034 --> 15:09.517
He'd been raised by his dad,

15:09.655 --> 15:12.482
after losing his mother
to cancer aged 13.

15:14.034 --> 15:17.551
When was the last time you had
contact with your dad?

15:17.689 --> 15:20.275
- About a year after
I got married.

15:20.413 --> 15:24.344
- So six years ago.
- Yeah.

15:24.482 --> 15:27.206
Once he found out that
I'm not gonna be there

15:27.344 --> 15:32.103
drinking with him anymore,
wasting my time anymore,

15:32.241 --> 15:36.620
then he's done, he doesn't have
a use for me anymore.

15:36.758 --> 15:39.413
He's not leading me
down that path to hell.

15:41.724 --> 15:43.896
- I could just imagine so many
people in the UK seeing you

15:44.034 --> 15:45.965
and thinking
you were somewhat jaded

15:46.103 --> 15:50.275
about life in the UK generally.
Is there something in that?

15:50.413 --> 15:52.586
- Probably more the society
waxing worse.

15:52.724 --> 15:54.896
- Yeah.
- When they forget God,

15:55.034 --> 15:57.034
they wax worse.

15:57.896 --> 16:00.103
People hate each other.

16:00.241 --> 16:02.172
It's just a divided society.

16:02.310 --> 16:04.275
- Between?

16:04.413 --> 16:08.793
False religion, the Muslims,
and everybody else.

16:08.931 --> 16:12.344
It's just hatred
between these factions.

16:12.482 --> 16:14.689
Things don't look good
for the UK.

16:14.827 --> 16:16.137
- It hurts to hear you say that.

16:16.275 --> 16:21.000
- Well, feelings...
Feelings, Mr. Louis.

16:23.517 --> 16:27.310
What good are feelings in front
of a judgment seat of Christ...

16:28.275 --> 16:29.827
where we all will be?

16:33.344 --> 16:34.793
- Matthias came across
as someone

16:34.931 --> 16:37.379
who'd never really
fitted in to his old life.

16:38.896 --> 16:40.655
A large family
selling a hateful brand

16:40.793 --> 16:43.034
of religious certainty
must've had appeal

16:43.172 --> 16:45.655
to someone who'd always
felt detached.

16:47.827 --> 16:50.620
With those born into Westboro,
I'd always tended to think

16:50.758 --> 16:54.172
they might've led normal lives
if raised elsewhere,

16:54.310 --> 16:57.000
away from the poisonous
influence of Pastor Phelps.

17:01.551 --> 17:05.379
But in the wake of his death,
strange reports had circulated.

17:05.517 --> 17:06.689
Sources had told me

17:06.827 --> 17:09.655
Gramps had had a change of heart
in his final days,

17:09.793 --> 17:12.827
causing him to be excommunicated
from his own church.

17:16.896 --> 17:18.862
- Do you want a sign, Louis?
- Oh, no, thank you.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.103
- You sure? 'Cause I got
some good ones in here.

17:21.241 --> 17:25.482
Let's use this one right here.
I like this one a lot.

17:25.620 --> 17:27.655
It's a good question,
it's a good Bible question.

17:27.793 --> 17:30.068
Why did God destroy Sodom?

17:30.206 --> 17:32.206
- Westboro had never
publicly made a statement

17:32.344 --> 17:34.517
about the death
of Pastor Phelps.

17:34.655 --> 17:36.413
- There's Shirley.
- Yep.

17:36.551 --> 17:38.172
- At a local picket,
I had a chance

17:38.310 --> 17:40.551
to speak to Fred Phelps's
daughter, Shirley.

17:40.689 --> 17:42.517
- Nice to see you.
- You too.

17:42.655 --> 17:44.620
- How are you doing?
- I'm doing well.

17:44.758 --> 17:46.034
I haven't seen you in a while.

17:46.172 --> 17:48.172
- What do we do, shake hands?
- No.

17:48.310 --> 17:50.310
- Nice to see you.
- You too.

17:58.034 --> 17:59.896
- In my previous visits,
Shirley had been

18:00.034 --> 18:03.655
an uncompromising and outspoken
messenger of God's hate.

18:03.793 --> 18:05.517
- You worship your backside.

18:05.655 --> 18:07.344
- Don't tell me what...
- You worship your tiny...

18:07.482 --> 18:09.655
You just said it!
You said it!

18:09.793 --> 18:12.758
Are you a homosexual?
Are you or not?

18:12.896 --> 18:15.413
- I didn't say God
worshipped my backside.

18:15.551 --> 18:17.931
- You do worship
your backside.

18:18.068 --> 18:21.034
- Since then, three of
her children had departed.

18:21.172 --> 18:22.793
According to Westboro beliefs,

18:22.931 --> 18:25.241
she was now forbidden
from seeing them.

18:25.379 --> 18:27.758
Among them was a daughter,
Megan.

18:27.896 --> 18:29.482
Well, I don't know what
to say, Shirley,

18:29.620 --> 18:33.379
'cause I know you've been
through a lot. And you've had...

18:33.517 --> 18:35.931
Three children have left
since I last saw you.

18:36.068 --> 18:37.586
- Yeah.
- That's a lot to take on board.

18:37.724 --> 18:39.965
- I still have more,
so there might be more leave.

18:40.103 --> 18:41.724
- You've got seven left.
- Yes.

18:41.862 --> 18:44.344
- That must've
been very painful.

18:44.482 --> 18:47.379
- Like life, it's all painful.

18:47.517 --> 18:49.448
You know I've been
in touch with Megan?

18:49.586 --> 18:51.103
- Well, I assumed you had.

18:51.241 --> 18:54.793
Yeah. You know she's married
and has a daughter now?

18:54.931 --> 18:56.724
Yes, I know that.

18:56.862 --> 18:59.241
Who I'm assuming
you haven't met?

18:59.379 --> 19:01.068
No, I have not.

19:01.206 --> 19:04.724
If she came back and wished
to sit down with you,

19:04.862 --> 19:06.068
how would that look?

19:06.206 --> 19:08.000
- To what end?

19:08.137 --> 19:09.620
- For a mother and daughter
to...

19:09.758 --> 19:12.758
Look, the Lord Jesus Christ
said that your enemies,

19:12.896 --> 19:16.344
that's his enemies, will be...
They have your own household.

19:16.482 --> 19:20.206
And Megan left because Megan
doesn't believe these things.

19:20.344 --> 19:22.068
So there's nothing to talk
about.

19:22.206 --> 19:24.310
- Am I right in thinking Gramps

19:24.448 --> 19:27.068
was voted out of the church
towards the end?

19:27.206 --> 19:30.896
So, first of all,
we would never talk

19:31.034 --> 19:34.103
about internal church
matters externally.

19:34.241 --> 19:36.689
Why would we do that?
It's none of your business.

19:36.827 --> 19:38.551
- Right.
- Whether somebody...

19:38.689 --> 19:40.310
- And he's dead.
- He is dead.

19:40.448 --> 19:43.206
So in a sense he's no longer
part of the church.

19:43.344 --> 19:45.137
So in a sense it's not
an internal church matter.

19:45.275 --> 19:46.862
- He's dead.
- Look...

19:47.000 --> 19:48.034
- Shirley's saying he's dead,

19:48.172 --> 19:49.965
what's the relevance
of him being dead?

19:50.103 --> 19:52.862
He's my dad and I'm not
gonna talk about him.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.793
Yeah, you're also selective
on your compassion, Louis.

19:57.034 --> 19:59.413
Well, you're talking
about your feelings.

19:59.551 --> 20:01.724
I thought you weren't big
on respecting feelings?

20:01.862 --> 20:03.655
- I don't respect feelings.

20:03.793 --> 20:05.000
So why are you playing
the feelings card?

20:05.137 --> 20:06.896
- I have some,
but I don't respect them.

20:07.034 --> 20:10.344
- You seem like you
used to be a truth seeker,

20:10.482 --> 20:12.931
and now you're just
a muck raker.

20:13.068 --> 20:14.517
I mean, what is all this?

20:14.655 --> 20:17.724
Come on, man, it's like
you haven't grown at all.

20:17.862 --> 20:20.551
You still wanna just kick
around the same things.

20:20.689 --> 20:22.310
Well, I'll take that
as a compliment.

20:22.448 --> 20:25.275
If he died having been
voted out of the church,

20:25.413 --> 20:28.172
would that mean
that he went to hell?

20:28.310 --> 20:30.344
So, first of all,
men are fallible.

20:30.482 --> 20:32.655
God's infallible,
men are fallible.

20:32.793 --> 20:36.000
Talking about Gramps, though,
at the end, did he fear God

20:36.137 --> 20:38.137
and obey his commandments
at the end?

20:38.275 --> 20:40.068
- Look, I don't know
a man's heart.

20:40.206 --> 20:42.413
- Oh, you...
That's such a double standard.

20:42.551 --> 20:43.758
It's not a double standard.

20:43.896 --> 20:45.896
It is. It's like if you're
outside of the church,

20:46.034 --> 20:48.000
then you hold them
to one standard,

20:48.137 --> 20:50.482
and then if it's Gramps,
it's all this,

20:50.620 --> 20:53.551
"maybe, don't know, could be,
might not, how could we know?"

20:53.689 --> 20:57.068
I do know that all of us sin,
but there's a difference.

20:57.206 --> 20:58.586
- But why was he voted
out of the church, then?

20:58.724 --> 21:00.896
- Nobody said he was.
- Well, I know he was.

21:01.034 --> 21:02.896
- Well, you don't know
that from anybody

21:03.034 --> 21:04.586
inside the church,
you know that...

21:04.724 --> 21:07.758
You're playing word games. The
fact that you won't confirm it

21:07.896 --> 21:09.275
doesn't mean
that it didn't happen.

21:09.413 --> 21:10.379
And I'm not gonna...

21:10.517 --> 21:12.103
- The fact that
you make the claim

21:12.241 --> 21:13.689
doesn't mean that
it happened either.

21:13.827 --> 21:14.896
- Well, I know it happened.

21:15.034 --> 21:17.724
OK, well, what else
do you wanna talk about?

21:17.862 --> 21:20.172
Do you wanna talk about
something that means something?

21:23.413 --> 21:25.172
- Shirley had come across
differently

21:25.310 --> 21:28.517
from previous visits,
as almost fragile.

21:44.586 --> 21:46.034
- I was on my way to see

21:46.172 --> 21:48.379
Shirley's eldest daughter,
Megan.

21:48.517 --> 21:50.896
Once one of Westboro's
most committed believers,

21:51.034 --> 21:53.172
she was now its most
outspoken critic,

21:53.310 --> 21:55.413
with a TED Talk
that had gone viral,

21:55.551 --> 21:57.551
a book coming out,
and a Hollywood movie

21:57.689 --> 22:00.241
about her life
said to be in the works.

22:00.379 --> 22:03.137
- 99.9% of mankind is
heading straight for hell,

22:03.275 --> 22:04.655
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

22:04.793 --> 22:06.241
- You guys, right...
- Wait, wait, I'm gay.

22:06.379 --> 22:08.758
- If you don't repent, you're
engaged in some filthy conduct,

22:08.896 --> 22:09.931
you're headed straight for hell

22:10.068 --> 22:11.793
and there's nothing you can do
about it.

22:20.413 --> 22:22.413
The church had been
my entire identity.

22:22.551 --> 22:26.103
So when I walked away from
Westboro, I walked into a void.

22:26.241 --> 22:29.206
I didn't know who I was,
or what I believed.

22:29.344 --> 22:31.551
I was terrified of my own mind,

22:31.689 --> 22:33.724
the mind that had been,
not just convinced,

22:33.862 --> 22:35.862
but passionately dedicated
to the idea

22:36.000 --> 22:39.896
that my primary duty in life
was to warn the world

22:40.034 --> 22:41.448
that they were all doomed.

22:43.068 --> 22:45.724
- In Nebraska, following a
college speaking engagement,

22:45.862 --> 22:48.379
I had a chance
to catch up with Megan.

22:50.344 --> 22:51.965
- Hello.
- Hello.

22:52.103 --> 22:53.000
There's two of you.

22:53.137 --> 22:54.965
Isn't that crazy?
Actually three.

22:55.103 --> 22:57.206
- Hi! Nice to see you.

22:57.344 --> 22:59.586
- So good to see you, Louis.

22:59.724 --> 23:02.379
- And this must be Solvi.
- Solvi.

23:02.517 --> 23:03.965
- What a cutie.

23:04.103 --> 23:06.379
Megan had emailed me soon
after she left the church,

23:06.517 --> 23:07.965
and we'd remained in touch.

23:08.103 --> 23:10.655
Yes, look at this, Megan.

23:11.655 --> 23:12.965
This is good grabbing.

23:13.103 --> 23:14.931
She was now married to a man

23:15.068 --> 23:18.896
she'd met on social media,
while still inside Westboro.

23:19.034 --> 23:21.310
- Gonna say "bye"? Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

23:21.448 --> 23:23.862
OK, I think you're gonna sit
there, if that works for you?

23:24.000 --> 23:25.931
- That's wonderful.
- And we'll just catch up.

23:26.827 --> 23:28.172
- When I last spoke to you,

23:28.310 --> 23:31.034
you were still inside
Westboro Baptist Church.

23:31.172 --> 23:35.448
How would you explain
why you left?

23:35.586 --> 23:38.241
- The shortest answer I can
think, is that it was

23:38.379 --> 23:40.310
conversations I was having
with people on Twitter,

23:40.448 --> 23:42.758
that first allowed me
to see inconsistencies

23:42.896 --> 23:44.586
within Westboro's ideology.

23:44.724 --> 23:48.103
Because the way that I saw
outsiders generally...

23:48.241 --> 23:50.034
Even, you know, people
I went to school with,

23:50.172 --> 23:52.551
there was always that sense
of otherness,

23:52.689 --> 23:54.620
always keeping them
at arm's length.

23:54.758 --> 23:57.724
Once I got on Twitter,
and started, you know,

23:57.862 --> 24:00.000
developing rapport with people,

24:00.137 --> 24:02.931
even though we obviously
were on totally different sides

24:03.068 --> 24:06.275
of basically every
scriptural issue,

24:06.413 --> 24:11.724
over time, it became this
community for me.

24:11.862 --> 24:14.689
And I started to care
about what they thought.

24:14.827 --> 24:17.103
And that made me start
to think, you know,

24:17.241 --> 24:19.241
I started to care
about how they felt.

24:19.379 --> 24:23.275
And then once that thread
started to unravel,

24:23.413 --> 24:25.241
I couldn't unsee it.

24:25.379 --> 24:26.827
- What occurs to me though,

24:26.965 --> 24:31.517
is that all through Westboro
practice and preaching,

24:31.655 --> 24:34.000
there are contradictions

24:34.137 --> 24:36.379
that you would've been
aware of growing up.

24:36.517 --> 24:38.896
But they also had this
kind of catch-all get-out

24:39.034 --> 24:41.724
to do with, well, you're mortal,

24:41.862 --> 24:44.379
and you can't understand
stuff that's divine.

24:44.517 --> 24:46.517
You don't get to decide,
you just have to obey.

24:46.655 --> 24:49.137
- Right. You know,
we claimed to love people.

24:49.275 --> 24:51.517
This was the biggest
contradiction of all, I think.

24:51.655 --> 24:55.344
And I was totally blind to it.

24:55.482 --> 24:58.586
How is it possible
that we could at once think

24:58.724 --> 25:00.310
that we were
loving our neighbour,

25:00.448 --> 25:02.448
and then at the same time,

25:02.586 --> 25:06.482
praying for God to kill them
in all sorts of terrible ways?

25:06.620 --> 25:10.172
So, the old me,
like, pre-Twitter,

25:10.310 --> 25:12.931
I would've found
a way to justify it,

25:13.068 --> 25:15.344
I would've accepted their
explanations for things.

25:15.482 --> 25:19.931
But once that crack was,
you know, kind of there,

25:20.068 --> 25:21.931
I was not gonna go
to any more funeral pickets.

25:22.068 --> 25:23.034
I wasn't gonna hold the signs

25:23.172 --> 25:25.103
that I believed were
unscriptural.

25:31.551 --> 25:34.310
- The sense of community Megan
derived from Twitter

25:34.448 --> 25:37.758
seemed to have had the effect of
amplifying her inner doubts,

25:37.896 --> 25:39.758
and emboldening her to leave.

25:42.793 --> 25:45.241
Alongside that had been
a feeling of resentment

25:45.379 --> 25:49.000
of what she saw as a takeover
by the church elders,

25:49.137 --> 25:50.551
sidelining her mother,

25:50.689 --> 25:54.000
and, after she left,
pushing out Gramps.

25:55.862 --> 25:57.482
So then how did it come about

25:57.620 --> 26:01.862
that Gramps kind of
fell out of favour?

26:02.000 --> 26:03.862
I mean, as I understand it,
he was actually

26:04.000 --> 26:06.689
voted out of the church.
Is that correct?

26:06.827 --> 26:08.413
Yeah, that's what I've heard

26:08.551 --> 26:11.448
from multiple people
who have left, since I did.

26:11.586 --> 26:15.275
And they all point to, like,
the day that he was voted out,

26:15.413 --> 26:20.482
he had gone out onto
the front lawn of the church

26:20.620 --> 26:23.068
and said, you know,
called out to the people

26:23.206 --> 26:24.310
at the Equality House...

26:24.448 --> 26:26.275
- That's the
rainbow-coloured house?

26:26.413 --> 26:30.137
Right. And said,
"You're good people."

26:30.275 --> 26:31.793
And, you know,

26:31.931 --> 26:33.724
they kind of ushered him
back inside and...

26:33.862 --> 26:36.551
Which would be completely
contradictory

26:36.689 --> 26:39.275
to his entire ministry.

26:39.413 --> 26:40.965
- Absolutely.

26:41.103 --> 26:43.896
And he was, I think,
at that point, 80,

26:44.034 --> 26:45.517
you know, 85.

26:45.655 --> 26:47.275
- What is your view?
Do you think

26:47.413 --> 26:50.103
that he had a sincere change
of heart at the end,

26:50.241 --> 26:52.689
or do you think that was
a symptom of dementia?

26:52.827 --> 26:55.413
- I think he did have
a change of heart,

26:55.551 --> 26:57.344
and they'll tell you that,
you know, he didn't.

26:57.482 --> 26:59.068
Of course he didn't have
a change in perspective.

26:59.206 --> 27:01.310
But the fact that it was
the actual,

27:01.448 --> 27:04.862
like, the thing that
triggered his expulsion,

27:05.000 --> 27:08.758
makes me believe
that it was real.

27:08.896 --> 27:11.310
Which is why, you know,
I still have hope

27:11.448 --> 27:14.137
that I'll get to have
my mom back someday.

27:18.034 --> 27:20.448
- It was encouraging to see
Megan embracing a life

27:20.586 --> 27:22.896
so radically different
to her old one.

27:23.034 --> 27:25.482
A testament to the power of
human connection

27:25.620 --> 27:27.517
to catalyse change.

27:27.655 --> 27:30.103
But whether Gramps
had really reformed

27:30.241 --> 27:32.068
remained an open question.

27:34.482 --> 27:37.655
I found myself wondering
who might be next to go.

27:37.793 --> 27:39.620
I knew Megan had a sister,

27:39.758 --> 27:41.931
Shirley's only remaining
daughter, Becca.

27:44.275 --> 27:46.034
Back in Topeka,
I found her picketing

27:46.172 --> 27:48.344
a local church under
the watchful eye

27:48.482 --> 27:52.172
of her older brother,
and Westboro elder, Sam.

27:52.310 --> 27:54.724
Becca, are you alright to talk
about your sisters

27:54.862 --> 27:56.931
- Megan and Grace a little bit?
- Sure. Yeah.

27:57.068 --> 27:58.827
What do you wanna say
about that?

27:58.965 --> 28:02.000
I say that it's a pretty sad
and sorrowful thing.

28:02.137 --> 28:04.000
I've been touch in
with Megan a little bit,

28:04.137 --> 28:09.344
and from her book, the sense I
got was there was a little bit

28:09.482 --> 28:12.758
of a changing of the guard
at Westboro,

28:12.896 --> 28:17.034
and that maybe your mum had been
somewhat pushed to the side.

28:17.172 --> 28:20.620
And that there were elders
who were maybe

28:20.758 --> 28:23.068
calling the shots more,

28:23.206 --> 28:26.482
and that that was difficult,
you know,

28:26.620 --> 28:29.034
for her and for Grace,
maybe for you as well.

28:29.172 --> 28:32.137
- I haven't read anything
Megan's put out since she left.

28:32.275 --> 28:34.448
Well, you would be able to
read it, though, wouldn't you?

28:34.586 --> 28:36.275
- I don't read articles,
I don't read the books.

28:36.413 --> 28:38.379
I've got my path
to run in front of me,

28:38.517 --> 28:40.344
and I put blinders on.

28:40.482 --> 28:43.034
She knows how to push my
buttons, and she's my sister,

28:43.172 --> 28:45.724
and she was that child
right in front of me.

28:45.862 --> 28:47.241
- You were very close.

28:47.379 --> 28:49.620
I depended on her for a lot of
things for a lot of years.

28:49.758 --> 28:51.862
And I thought at one point...

28:52.000 --> 28:54.655
when I saw
that she was derailing,

28:54.793 --> 28:56.827
when I saw that things
were going south

28:56.965 --> 28:59.448
and she would be
in my prayers every night.

28:59.586 --> 29:02.551
It was so distressing,
watching her...

29:02.689 --> 29:04.551
and leading Grace.

29:04.689 --> 29:08.965
- And then she walked away.

29:09.103 --> 29:12.379
We didn't leave her,
she walked away.

29:12.517 --> 29:15.517
So you don't get to come
with her perspective,

29:15.655 --> 29:19.827
and her gripes against the way
that God set up

29:19.965 --> 29:22.620
the order of things
in this world.

29:22.758 --> 29:25.655
That a woman submits
herself to her husband,

29:25.793 --> 29:27.965
that the man is the head
of the woman.

29:28.103 --> 29:29.724
And to drag us through the mud

29:29.862 --> 29:31.482
because she doesn't wanna
submit,

29:31.620 --> 29:33.931
where we do want to submit.

29:34.068 --> 29:35.758
And you can try
to make us ashamed,

29:35.896 --> 29:38.551
and say we're misogynistic
and all that crap,

29:38.689 --> 29:40.862
and you can take it
right to hell with you,

29:41.000 --> 29:42.931
if that's what
you're gonna hold on to.

29:43.068 --> 29:45.310
- We were getting to a moment
of emotion with Becca,

29:45.448 --> 29:47.344
and you just kind of stomped
all over it.

29:47.482 --> 29:48.724
- Yeah.

29:48.862 --> 29:50.827
- I love it.
I give him full permission.

29:50.965 --> 29:52.862
It's almost like it was
symptomatic

29:53.000 --> 29:55.448
of the narrative
that I was pushing,

29:55.586 --> 29:58.413
that I asked a female member
of the church a question,

29:58.551 --> 30:01.793
and then the elder came
and spoke for her.

30:01.931 --> 30:03.724
And you asked my mom about it,
and she answered you!

30:03.862 --> 30:05.586
- But you're OK with that?
- He spoke with me.

30:05.724 --> 30:07.241
- You liked that
he answered for you?

30:07.379 --> 30:10.344
I love how the Lord

30:10.482 --> 30:13.758
puts the order of things
in the Earth.

30:13.896 --> 30:15.896
There's great help
to be had there,

30:16.034 --> 30:18.068
and there's great safety
to be had there.

30:18.206 --> 30:21.896
- What you're doing is,
you're setting up a world

30:22.034 --> 30:23.931
where women are so helpless,

30:24.068 --> 30:26.517
that they can't say what they
think and what they mean

30:26.655 --> 30:28.137
in front of men.
Is that what it is?

30:28.275 --> 30:30.034
They can if you're there
speaking for them.

30:30.172 --> 30:31.931
- OK, 'cause she's my sister
too, Louis,

30:32.068 --> 30:34.448
but you didn't come asking me
these questions, did ya?

30:34.586 --> 30:36.413
- Would you like me to?

30:36.551 --> 30:38.310
- That's a cute play you've got.

30:39.551 --> 30:41.620
We can schedule an interview.

30:41.758 --> 30:45.586
- Uh-huh. This is subversive
behaviour on your part.

30:45.724 --> 30:46.862
It's kind of scary, though,

30:47.000 --> 30:49.034
that you've been condemned
to such a thing.

30:49.172 --> 30:51.896
To be the accuser
of the brethren.

30:52.034 --> 30:54.689
That's work of Satan.

30:54.827 --> 30:56.310
- Dude, why are you still here?

30:56.448 --> 30:58.344
- Why are you still here?
- 'Cause I want him here!

30:58.482 --> 31:02.758
- Oh, Louis. You're so slimy
and slithery, bro.

31:04.586 --> 31:06.965
- What are you doing
for work these days?

31:07.103 --> 31:10.068
- I work at Phelps
Chartered Law Firm.

31:10.206 --> 31:11.931
- Cool.
- Kind of play of lot of roles.

31:12.068 --> 31:15.206
- You're not married?
- Not married yet.

31:15.344 --> 31:18.724
- Better to walk alone?
- I'm engaged.

31:18.862 --> 31:20.310
- Are you?
- Yeah.

31:20.448 --> 31:23.103
- Who to?

31:23.241 --> 31:26.551
- Are you serious?
When did that happen?

31:26.689 --> 31:28.551
- February 7th.

31:28.689 --> 31:31.448
- It's all quite new.
- It's very new.

31:31.586 --> 31:33.586
Joshua. Congrats.

31:33.724 --> 31:36.413
- I think it's time to go.
- Hey, we've gotta go, guys.

31:39.000 --> 31:42.137
- Becca's engagement
to newcomer Josh Jakes

31:42.275 --> 31:44.827
suggested she might not
be leaving any time soon.

31:49.034 --> 31:51.275
Despite the hate
they spew at pickets,

31:51.413 --> 31:55.379
in theory, anyone can attend
a Westboro Sunday service.

31:55.517 --> 31:58.413
This is sometimes the first step
on the road to joining.

32:03.241 --> 32:06.482
Among those preparing
to worship was a new face.

32:07.965 --> 32:09.655
- Louis.
- Good to meet you, Louis.

32:09.793 --> 32:11.241
- How's it going?
- It's going alright.

32:11.379 --> 32:13.620
- What's your name?
- J, just the letter J.

32:13.758 --> 32:15.103
- So what's going on with you?

32:15.241 --> 32:17.241
How did you hear about it,
and why are you here?

32:17.379 --> 32:19.517
- I've seen both of your
previous documentaries,

32:19.655 --> 32:21.827
and actually I wanted
to thank you for that.

32:21.965 --> 32:24.758
Because I was able to come
to my current position

32:24.896 --> 32:27.034
in relation
to the Westboro Church,

32:27.172 --> 32:28.275
as a result partly of watching

32:28.413 --> 32:30.034
those two documentaries
that you did,

32:30.172 --> 32:33.586
which I am about 90-some percent

32:33.724 --> 32:36.241
on the same page with
Westboro's doctrine.

32:36.379 --> 32:39.965
- I made those programs from
a humanistic perspective.

32:40.103 --> 32:41.448
- Right.

32:41.586 --> 32:44.620
As a way of showing how
poisonous and hateful practices

32:44.758 --> 32:48.137
had grown out of a certain kind
of religious practice.

32:48.275 --> 32:51.241
You didn't see that I was
attempting to elicit...

32:51.379 --> 32:53.896
I saw what you were attempting
to do, yeah, I did see that.

32:54.034 --> 32:55.827
- Psychological take,
if you like.

32:55.965 --> 32:58.275
I heard what they were saying,

32:58.413 --> 33:00.103
and I really don't believe
in my heart

33:00.241 --> 33:02.103
that they're a hate group.

33:02.241 --> 33:04.172
In fact, I'm pansexual myself.

33:04.310 --> 33:07.413
But because I'm a Christian,
I'm a born-again Christian,

33:07.551 --> 33:11.827
I feel God's call to conform
to the image of Christ.

33:11.965 --> 33:14.310
Hang on, wait a second.
You just said...

33:14.448 --> 33:15.586
You're pansexual?

33:15.724 --> 33:17.000
- That's right.
- What does that mean?

33:17.137 --> 33:20.000
Pansexual is essentially
that my sexual attractions

33:20.137 --> 33:23.000
are not limited
to any specific gender,

33:23.137 --> 33:24.896
gender identity
or gender expression.

33:25.034 --> 33:26.379
- Do you mean...
- It's not that I am

33:26.517 --> 33:28.379
attracted to everyone, but I
could be attracted to anyone.

33:28.517 --> 33:31.310
But I believe
that God's calling for me

33:31.448 --> 33:33.620
to conform to his image
is more important

33:33.758 --> 33:36.241
than my fulfilling my earthly...

33:38.068 --> 33:40.068
urges and desires.

33:40.206 --> 33:43.931
- So you are celibate,
is that right? At the moment?

33:44.068 --> 33:46.000
- That's correct. The first time
I engaged in intercourse

33:46.137 --> 33:48.793
was August,
and that was a mistake.

33:48.931 --> 33:53.517
You know, it's either
you pursue temporary enjoyment

33:53.655 --> 33:55.241
and you suffer eternally,

33:55.379 --> 33:58.896
or you suffer for a little while
to be in the presence of God.

34:03.172 --> 34:05.517
- In former years,
Gramps's weekly sermons

34:05.655 --> 34:09.310
had been his chance to impart
his fire-and-brimstone theology

34:09.448 --> 34:11.206
to the congregation.

34:11.344 --> 34:15.793
God put it in your wicked heart
to start that war.

34:15.931 --> 34:18.034
It's almost 18 months now
in the siege,

34:18.172 --> 34:20.344
you've got people eating
their babies...

34:22.137 --> 34:25.379
and their small children,
and each other!

34:25.517 --> 34:27.517
You're gonna eat your babies!

34:28.724 --> 34:30.689
- Since his death,
the seven church elders

34:30.827 --> 34:32.413
took turns in the pulpit.

34:34.413 --> 34:36.448
- Now, when it comes
to this issue of arms,

34:36.586 --> 34:39.482
if there was ever a thing
that people liked to flaunt...

34:40.379 --> 34:42.206
And it's sickening, really.

34:42.344 --> 34:45.172
People absolutely love
for others to know

34:45.310 --> 34:46.931
about their acts of charity.

34:47.068 --> 34:50.689
Saying, "Here's my act of good."

34:50.827 --> 34:53.551
- It was striking how
much the preaching style,

34:53.689 --> 34:56.551
and even the message
of the sermon, had mellowed.

34:56.689 --> 35:00.310
- Being a peacemaker means
that you tell people

35:00.448 --> 35:02.241
how to have peace.

35:02.379 --> 35:07.172
Lasting, real, true peace.

35:07.310 --> 35:11.517
And that comes in one way,
being right with God.

35:19.344 --> 35:21.310
- Increasingly I wondered
if Gramps's death

35:21.448 --> 35:24.448
might've led to a toning down
of church practices,

35:24.586 --> 35:28.275
and whether it might even
foretell bigger changes.

35:28.413 --> 35:32.448
And it was possible the process
had started before he died.

35:32.586 --> 35:34.482
By now I'd heard from
more sources

35:34.620 --> 35:36.482
that Gramps
had been excommunicated

35:36.620 --> 35:38.931
for behaviour
related to dementia.

35:40.517 --> 35:42.689
With the church
unwilling to discuss it,

35:42.827 --> 35:45.137
I'd made contact with one
of the most recent defectors,

35:45.275 --> 35:47.103
who had been at the meeting
where Gramps

35:47.241 --> 35:49.068
had been voted out of
the church.

35:50.379 --> 35:53.379
Fred Phelps's granddaughter,
and Shirley's niece,

35:53.517 --> 35:55.482
21-year-old
Rachel Hockenbarger.

35:58.137 --> 35:59.517
- Hi, Rachel?
- Hi, yeah.

35:59.655 --> 36:00.758
- Louis.
- Yeah.

36:00.896 --> 36:02.448
- How you doing?
- I'm good, how are you?

36:02.586 --> 36:03.862
Nice to meet you.
Can we come in?

36:04.000 --> 36:05.241
- Yeah, of course.
- Look at you!

36:05.379 --> 36:07.827
- You don't look very Westboro.
- That's the point!

36:09.965 --> 36:11.482
- Tell me about your tattoos?

36:11.620 --> 36:14.482
- So I have this one down here.
This is the first one I got,

36:14.620 --> 36:17.758
and it is my siblings and I's
initials,

36:17.896 --> 36:21.000
first and second initial,
all in binary code.

36:22.620 --> 36:25.206
And then I have one up here.

36:25.344 --> 36:27.034
- "Whatever nightmares
the future holds,

36:27.172 --> 36:29.793
"are dreams compared to
what's behind me."

36:29.931 --> 36:32.586
Yes, it's a quote from
'Guardians of the Galaxy',

36:32.724 --> 36:35.620
Gamora says it,
which is who that glass is.

36:35.758 --> 36:37.689
She's one of my favourite
characters.

36:37.827 --> 36:39.689
- Does that mean
something to you?

36:39.827 --> 36:41.448
- Yeah, just trying
to move forward.

36:41.586 --> 36:43.758
And that was a concept I played
with a long time in my head.

36:43.896 --> 36:45.724
- Were you a true believer?

36:45.862 --> 36:48.379
Did you sincerely believe
when you were inside?

36:48.517 --> 36:52.068
- For a long time, yeah.
I was baptised when I was ten.

36:52.206 --> 36:53.517
- Which is quite young,
isn't it?

36:53.655 --> 36:56.862
- Yes. Not the youngest,
but I was quite young.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.758
I was just so angry
all the time,

36:58.896 --> 37:01.103
because I was being forced
to hate people.

37:01.241 --> 37:04.793
And I was always told
that I was, like, blessed

37:04.931 --> 37:07.275
to be born where I was born,
but I didn't feel that way.

37:07.413 --> 37:10.206
- I felt like it was a curse.
- Why?

37:10.344 --> 37:12.034
Because you go out to pickets,

37:12.172 --> 37:14.586
and you get things thrown at
you, you get screamed at,

37:14.724 --> 37:17.000
and it's just,
everybody hates you,

37:17.137 --> 37:19.379
and you hate yourself for it.

37:23.827 --> 37:27.758
- So you were there when Gramps,

37:27.896 --> 37:31.068
- your grandfather, died?
- Yeah.

37:33.758 --> 37:36.275
And one thing
that's been alleged

37:36.413 --> 37:38.793
is that he was out of favour
when he died.

37:38.931 --> 37:41.965
- Yeah, it was very true.
Um, they...

37:44.620 --> 37:47.206
He was very sick
and they isolated him

37:47.344 --> 37:50.379
to his own house, and made
him live there by himself,

37:50.517 --> 37:53.137
when he was too old and too sick
to take care of himself.

37:53.275 --> 37:57.034
And then they ended up moving
him to, like, a hospice home.

37:57.172 --> 38:00.103
- What had he done wrong
to be out of favour?

38:00.241 --> 38:03.344
- They said he was
mistreating his wife,

38:03.482 --> 38:07.103
and then he had told
the people across the street

38:07.241 --> 38:09.758
at The Rainbow House that
they were good people.

38:09.896 --> 38:12.655
Do you think this thing happened
with The Rainbow House?

38:12.793 --> 38:15.827
- I do think it happened. Like,
obviously I didn't see it,

38:15.965 --> 38:20.241
but it's been talked about
with, like, the group.

38:20.379 --> 38:22.275
- The church members
at the time discussed it?

38:22.413 --> 38:23.482
- Yeah.

38:23.620 --> 38:25.310
- And it was seen as what?
Evidence of...

38:25.448 --> 38:27.620
That he had fallen out of faith.

38:27.758 --> 38:29.448
They see a lot of,
like, especially, like,

38:29.586 --> 38:34.068
mental illnesses and stuff like
that as demons, as a curse.

38:34.206 --> 38:38.068
And so they're like,
if God let that happen to him

38:38.206 --> 38:42.172
then it is how he is
as a person basically.

38:42.310 --> 38:46.172
- So it wouldn't be
purely medical?

38:46.310 --> 38:47.379
- No.

38:47.517 --> 38:51.034
It would be some symptom
of divine disfavour?

38:51.172 --> 38:53.275
- Yes. They don't like
to talk about it

38:53.413 --> 38:55.413
because, you know,
if you kicked him out,

38:55.551 --> 38:58.896
then what strength do you have,
what's your foundation?

38:59.034 --> 39:01.482
- Right, because if it
turns out he was fallible...

39:01.620 --> 39:03.034
Mm-hmm.

39:03.172 --> 39:06.137
..then, you know, maybe a lot
of the other interpretations

39:06.275 --> 39:08.172
he put on things were incorrect.

39:08.310 --> 39:10.379
Yep.

39:12.724 --> 39:14.586
- Do you think
they'll ever change,

39:14.724 --> 39:20.034
and there's a chance of it
all becoming almost normal?

39:20.172 --> 39:22.034
- Maybe. I can't expect it,

39:22.172 --> 39:24.000
but like I do have, like,
some hope that, like,

39:24.137 --> 39:27.137
something will trigger this,
like, compete unravel of it.

39:27.275 --> 39:30.448
You know, every kingdom falls,
it's bound to happen eventually.

39:30.586 --> 39:34.275
But I don't wanna sit around
and wait for it to happen.

39:41.137 --> 39:44.344
- The idea of Fred Phelps
being cut off and isolated

39:44.482 --> 39:46.517
when he died seemed ironic,

39:46.655 --> 39:49.310
given his role in creating
the doctrine.

39:50.896 --> 39:52.758
Gramps's removal had coincided

39:52.896 --> 39:55.965
with the increasing influence
of the male elders,

39:56.103 --> 39:58.793
and it was clear something
was changing at Westboro.

39:58.931 --> 40:01.241
Though exactly what,
and whether for the better,

40:01.379 --> 40:02.931
was hard to say.

40:04.413 --> 40:05.896
With these questions in mind,

40:06.034 --> 40:08.517
I was paying a visit
to another church leader

40:08.655 --> 40:12.448
who seemed to have been
sidelined, Shirley.

40:14.827 --> 40:16.517
- Hello.
- Oh, snap!

40:16.655 --> 40:20.103
- How are you doing?
- Look at you, all in pink.

40:20.241 --> 40:23.275
Yeah. My mom lives here now.

40:23.413 --> 40:25.344
- How's she doing?
- She's doing well.

40:25.482 --> 40:27.896
- Shall I sit here?
- Sure, if you would like.

40:30.827 --> 40:33.034
So what's been happening?

40:33.172 --> 40:36.586
- A lot of good stuff.

40:36.724 --> 40:39.137
- Yeah. And some not so good.

40:39.275 --> 40:41.551
- No, it's pretty much all good.

40:41.689 --> 40:44.655
- The picture I have
sort of pieced together,

40:44.793 --> 40:49.068
is that Gramps died
and I've been told

40:49.206 --> 40:54.275
that he'd been voted out
of the church in 2013.

40:54.413 --> 40:57.931
And I'd heard that one
of the reasons he was voted out

40:58.068 --> 41:03.000
was because he had approached
The Rainbow House,

41:03.137 --> 41:05.620
next door to where
the chapel is,

41:05.758 --> 41:07.482
and said, "You're good people."

41:07.620 --> 41:10.206
And this was viewed
as in contradiction

41:10.344 --> 41:12.241
to everything
he'd ever preached.

41:12.379 --> 41:16.275
- He did not mean in any
of his words to say,

41:16.413 --> 41:21.517
that it is OK
to flagrantly violate

41:21.655 --> 41:23.517
the commandments of God.

41:23.655 --> 41:26.931
- Evidently, whatever
your father said...

41:29.103 --> 41:32.413
was part of a case
that was made against him,

41:32.551 --> 41:35.965
that led to him being
voted out of the church.

41:36.103 --> 41:40.172
- You don't have the full facts
about from the day

41:40.310 --> 41:43.275
that you're speaking of,
to the day that he died.

41:43.413 --> 41:44.965
You don't have the full facts.

41:45.103 --> 41:46.724
- Well, would you care
to enlighten me?

41:46.862 --> 41:48.413
No.

41:53.655 --> 41:58.137
I mean, I'm sure it's been
immensely painful to you,

41:58.275 --> 42:02.172
to have two of your daughters
leave at the same time.

42:02.310 --> 42:06.034
And then not that long
after that, your son Zach.

42:07.482 --> 42:09.931
Would you like to give me
a sense of how that felt?

42:11.931 --> 42:15.034
- Well, I know you have a child.

42:15.172 --> 42:16.896
- Three.

42:17.034 --> 42:20.000
- It didn't start
the day they left.

42:25.413 --> 42:27.862
I told you
when you here last,

42:28.000 --> 42:30.448
that I see things
in the children

42:30.586 --> 42:33.689
that cause me to wonder.

42:36.655 --> 42:41.758
But I also told you that
if all of them leave...

42:46.655 --> 42:49.689
Sorry...
Just give me a second...

42:50.931 --> 42:56.655
..that it does not
change anything.

42:56.793 --> 42:59.655
It certainly doesn't change God.

42:59.793 --> 43:02.344
And it doesn't change
what I'm gonna do.

43:02.482 --> 43:05.310
And don't ask me
questions like that.

43:06.275 --> 43:10.517
It's... They were my children.

43:16.586 --> 43:18.620
Everything that I had...

43:25.931 --> 43:27.413
..was theirs.

43:28.551 --> 43:33.413
Everything that I know
was theirs.

43:35.137 --> 43:37.000
We treated them well.

43:40.655 --> 43:46.206
But, we don't...

43:49.931 --> 43:52.103
..control the heart,

43:52.241 --> 43:55.413
we don't own salvation,

43:55.551 --> 43:58.172
we can't do anything about that.

43:59.655 --> 44:01.413
So...

44:01.551 --> 44:06.689
we go with the wisdom of God

44:06.827 --> 44:08.344
on all of these matters.

44:08.482 --> 44:13.965
It doesn't change the fact
that it's sad,

44:14.103 --> 44:16.137
and painful.

44:18.724 --> 44:21.758
- It was strange to see
a woman so broken by grief,

44:21.896 --> 44:23.896
and at the same time,
so unyielding.

44:24.034 --> 44:26.689
A self-created victim
of the hate

44:26.827 --> 44:29.068
she had sowed
for so many years.

44:33.310 --> 44:35.206
- You guys are gonna
scare your child!

44:35.344 --> 44:37.896
I'm from your neighbourhood,
man. I'm from Topeka.

44:38.034 --> 44:39.862
I know where y'all are from,
man.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.310
Y'all are all trash, y'all
are terrible human beings.

44:42.448 --> 44:44.655
I don't care what you say.
You're scaring your child.

44:44.793 --> 44:46.517
- And so we give a fuck
what you say?

44:46.655 --> 44:49.344
- Another day of
picketing basketball,

44:49.482 --> 44:51.172
and I had a moment
to reflect on what

44:51.310 --> 44:53.551
I'd seen since being back.

44:53.689 --> 44:56.275
A church still dedicated
to promoting bigotry,

44:56.413 --> 44:59.482
though in a slightly
diluted form.

45:00.724 --> 45:03.034
Losing members,
but making up numbers

45:03.172 --> 45:06.620
with a new wave of
seekers and troubled souls.

45:06.758 --> 45:10.379
- My life now
is lived for the Lord.

45:10.517 --> 45:12.896
It's not my life,
it's not my decision.

45:13.034 --> 45:16.000
I'm here because the Lord
brought me here.

45:18.103 --> 45:20.793
- A group going
through changes,

45:20.931 --> 45:23.655
but with a future
that was hard to predict.

45:29.793 --> 45:31.931
So who lives upstairs here now?

45:32.068 --> 45:33.965
- Nobody lives upstairs.

45:34.103 --> 45:37.103
- I decided to speak
once more to Steve Drain.

45:37.241 --> 45:40.034
- So you've been here before.
- Yes, I have.

45:44.275 --> 45:46.034
- You know,
I'm gonna put a scenario,

45:46.172 --> 45:48.724
and you probably won't like it,
but I'm gonna put it out there.

45:48.862 --> 45:51.103
So the view I think
I'm gonna take is that

45:51.241 --> 45:54.137
obviously Gramps died,
and since then,

45:54.275 --> 45:57.620
what I see is a little bit
of a mellowing.

45:57.758 --> 45:59.310
Did that shock you
when I said that?

45:59.448 --> 46:01.206
- It doesn't shock me
at all and I...

46:01.344 --> 46:02.586
- 'Cause you recognised it.

46:02.724 --> 46:05.931
No, it's because
it amazes me for you

46:06.068 --> 46:09.689
to think that you can come here
for a couple of days,

46:09.827 --> 46:12.103
and now you've got the new view
of our church.

46:12.241 --> 46:13.827
- Well, I knew you wouldn't
agree with it.

46:13.965 --> 46:15.448
- No, it's not that
I don't agree with it.

46:15.586 --> 46:18.275
Hey, listen, you still,
you still keep trying

46:18.413 --> 46:20.551
to fit a square peg
in a round hole, Louis.

46:20.689 --> 46:23.344
We love the Lord,
that's what we do here.

46:23.482 --> 46:24.724
Mmm. I don't think
that's the part

46:24.862 --> 46:25.965
that people are offended by.

46:26.103 --> 46:27.689
- What are they offended by?
- Well...

46:27.827 --> 46:30.379
The word of God, that's what
they're offended by.

46:30.517 --> 46:34.655
I think the wanton use
of the term "fag" is...

46:34.793 --> 46:37.379
Really? That's the hill
to die on?

46:37.517 --> 46:39.620
How about this,
they're sodomites,

46:39.758 --> 46:41.034
it's a filthy sin.

46:41.172 --> 46:44.206
And we're not gonna sit here
and sanitise it,

46:44.344 --> 46:46.241
because the world wants to
sanitise

46:46.379 --> 46:49.448
that word etymologically,
into respectability. Fags.

46:49.586 --> 46:51.793
- Well, yesterday the "F" word
was only on one placard

46:51.931 --> 46:53.000
out of about 25.

46:53.137 --> 46:54.448
Well, that's because
we have so many...

46:54.586 --> 46:56.551
In the old days, it'd be half of
them would say stuff like that.

46:56.689 --> 46:58.448
- That's because we
have so many more messages.

46:58.586 --> 47:00.172
Come here. Look here.

47:03.103 --> 47:05.620
That's common vernacular,
right there.

47:05.758 --> 47:07.068
"Most people go to hell."

47:07.206 --> 47:09.241
Does that not worry you?
Well, check this out...

47:09.379 --> 47:11.655
But you could see that in
any kind of fundamentalist,

47:11.793 --> 47:14.034
or evangelical corner
of the street,

47:14.172 --> 47:15.896
The End Is Nigh, Ministry,
what you're...

47:16.034 --> 47:18.000
Then go and do a documentary
on them then.

47:18.137 --> 47:20.206
- That is classic Phelps.

47:20.344 --> 47:21.965
- I made that sign.
- Yeah.

47:22.103 --> 47:23.724
But, you know, those aren't
Easter bunny heads.

47:23.862 --> 47:25.551
Those are Playboy Bunny heads.

47:25.689 --> 47:27.965
- Yes, they are.
- On fag bodies so...

47:28.103 --> 47:33.413
- Is it still the case
that you rejoice,

47:33.551 --> 47:37.965
and are happy at the idea of,

47:38.103 --> 47:39.517
say, soldiers being blown up,

47:39.655 --> 47:42.310
or people being killed
in spree shootings?

47:42.448 --> 47:44.172
Those are righteous judgements
of God,

47:44.310 --> 47:46.896
because he certainly not only
could've prevented it,

47:47.034 --> 47:50.310
but would have prevented
if his will dictated so.

47:50.448 --> 47:52.413
Right, I got that, but I'm
asking a really simple question.

47:52.551 --> 47:56.034
I have seen with my own eyes,
members of this church

47:56.172 --> 48:00.758
laughing, hooting, jubilating
at funeral pickets,

48:00.896 --> 48:03.620
right,
expressing joy and happiness.

48:03.758 --> 48:06.896
- I can rejoice over it being
a righteous judgement of God.

48:07.034 --> 48:08.620
And on a human level, go,

48:08.758 --> 48:11.172
"Man, I think that's pretty sad
that that person died."

48:11.310 --> 48:13.034
Doesn't mean that on
a human level we don't think

48:13.172 --> 48:14.793
that it's a sorrowful thing
that happened.

48:14.931 --> 48:17.034
- Do you know
what facial expression

48:17.172 --> 48:19.068
goes with the idea
of rejoicing sorrowfully?

48:19.206 --> 48:20.413
- You're not confusing...

48:20.551 --> 48:22.586
Is that a smile,
or, what emoji is that?

48:22.724 --> 48:25.517
- It's a ludicrous concept.
- It's not a ludicrous concept.

48:25.655 --> 48:27.206
And it speaks to the
contradiction.

48:27.344 --> 48:29.620
You're inhabiting a
contradictory concept,

48:29.758 --> 48:31.172
and you're trying make
it sound reasonable,

48:31.310 --> 48:32.379
it doesn't make any sense.

48:32.517 --> 48:34.448
I think that
what you're doing here

48:34.586 --> 48:35.931
is kind of pernicious, Louis.

48:36.068 --> 48:38.310
Can you elevate the dialogue
a little bit here, brother?

48:38.448 --> 48:40.275
The feeling I get
is that you have

48:40.413 --> 48:42.000
a more complicated
attitude now.

48:42.137 --> 48:43.931
It's less balls-out,

48:44.068 --> 48:46.344
get horrible words
in these people's faces

48:46.482 --> 48:48.034
when they're in
a vulnerable state.

48:48.172 --> 48:50.275
Maybe the suffering that
you've all lived through,

48:50.413 --> 48:52.034
losing so many family members,

48:52.172 --> 48:55.000
has induced you to be more
compassionate and sympathetic

48:55.137 --> 48:58.068
to the pain and suffering
you inflict on others.

48:58.206 --> 49:00.586
Well, I think that's kind of
a simplistic viewpoint.

49:00.724 --> 49:04.655
It's called growth, Louis,
it's called change and growth.

49:06.310 --> 49:08.827
- My conversation with Steve
made me reflect

49:08.965 --> 49:12.000
on the delicate position
Westboro was in,

49:12.137 --> 49:15.344
facing a choice of how much
of Gramps's legacy to continue,

49:15.482 --> 49:18.103
but unable to admit to
any deviation

49:18.241 --> 49:21.517
from a doctrine that allowed for
no possibility of error.

49:27.965 --> 49:29.793
- Thanks for getting
the diaper bag.

49:29.931 --> 49:31.896
- No problem.
It's part of the service.

49:33.931 --> 49:36.275
Megan was in town

49:36.413 --> 49:39.103
on a visit to some other
ex-Westboro members.

49:39.241 --> 49:41.137
She decided to make
an unannounced stop off

49:41.275 --> 49:44.517
at her old home,
and she'd invited me along.

49:44.655 --> 49:46.620
So, what's the plan?

49:46.758 --> 49:48.793
- My dad's birthday's
on Saturday

49:48.931 --> 49:51.103
and any time I'm around
at one of these times,

49:51.241 --> 49:54.275
I try to leave something...
something there.

49:56.172 --> 49:57.275
- Sorry, I can't see.

49:57.413 --> 49:58.793
I'm just trying to figure out
where I'm going.

49:58.931 --> 50:00.620
- There we go!

50:02.103 --> 50:03.517
Hey.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.310
- By now, in addition
to Becca's engagement,

50:09.448 --> 50:11.344
I'd learned Megan's brother
Jonah

50:11.482 --> 50:14.965
was also getting married
to one of the Jakes siblings.

50:15.103 --> 50:17.275
I was intending
on sharing the news.

50:19.275 --> 50:21.862
I wanna bring you
up to date on...

50:23.000 --> 50:24.724
Well, I guess get your reaction

50:24.862 --> 50:27.206
to what I've learned from
being back a little bit.

50:27.344 --> 50:29.620
But maybe we should do that
after we walk around.

50:43.620 --> 50:47.206
By giving a card to your dad
for his birthday...

50:47.344 --> 50:49.034
- Yeah.
- ..you're doing that for you

50:49.172 --> 50:51.000
or for him,
or for some other reason?

50:51.137 --> 50:53.827
It is for me,
because I'm trying to be

50:53.965 --> 50:56.586
the kind of person
that I wanna be, you know.

50:56.724 --> 50:59.206
It is also because there is
this narrative in the church,

50:59.344 --> 51:01.689
that when people leave,
that they don't care about you.

51:01.827 --> 51:03.137
Mm-hm.

51:03.275 --> 51:04.551
That they just wanna go off
and live a life of sin,

51:04.689 --> 51:07.379
and that you don't matter
to them anymore,

51:07.517 --> 51:10.482
and all of these things.
And it's just not true.

51:10.620 --> 51:13.827
And I want them to know what
we're thinking and feeling,

51:13.965 --> 51:17.275
and hope it will have some
kind of impact,

51:17.413 --> 51:20.137
like, I don't know.

51:20.275 --> 51:22.241
So I'm just gonna go do this
real quick.

51:45.206 --> 51:46.586
- Are you OK?
- Yep.

51:46.724 --> 51:48.000
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

51:49.413 --> 51:51.206
Do you think she might be
in there?

51:51.344 --> 51:53.034
Yeah. The van's there.

51:55.655 --> 51:58.758
- But why don't I knock?
- Out of interest.

51:58.896 --> 52:01.551
My sister knocked once,
and they turned off the lights

52:01.689 --> 52:04.758
and pretended they weren't
there.

52:04.896 --> 52:08.241
I just hate the sense
that I'm now, you know,

52:08.379 --> 52:10.241
one of the people that
they're watching out for.

52:10.379 --> 52:11.793
That they're watching
on the cameras,

52:11.931 --> 52:14.206
and then sending these text
messages to the whole group,

52:14.344 --> 52:17.931
you know, to warn them of,
you know, this...

52:19.241 --> 52:21.034
whatever word you wanna use.

52:21.172 --> 52:23.000
What word would they use?

52:24.586 --> 52:27.862
Rebel. I mean, that's...
an easy one that comes to mind.

52:28.000 --> 52:29.793
But it's kind of funny.

52:29.931 --> 52:32.379
- Depraved, filthy beast.
- Sure.

52:32.517 --> 52:34.620
- That's a bit more colourful.

52:40.827 --> 52:42.965
- Much has been written about
the best way to reach

52:43.103 --> 52:45.655
the indoctrinated minds
of Westboro,

52:45.793 --> 52:49.068
whether to confront,
or protest, or ignore.

52:49.206 --> 52:52.862
Megan's approach, a sustained
and friendly engagement,

52:53.000 --> 52:55.275
was based on what
had worked with her.

52:58.620 --> 53:00.206
I think JR and Matt
are in that one.

53:00.344 --> 53:01.655
Is that right?

53:01.793 --> 53:03.344
They're in the one that John
and Paulette were in.

53:03.482 --> 53:05.379
- Oh, that's this one.
- That's this one?

53:05.517 --> 53:07.413
Musical houses.

53:07.551 --> 53:10.448
You know that...
I feel weird telling you this,

53:10.586 --> 53:13.413
you probably know it,
that Becca's engaged.

53:13.551 --> 53:19.000
No. No. To whom?

53:20.586 --> 53:23.206
Josh Jakes.

53:23.344 --> 53:25.655
I think they were a family
that arrived after you left.

53:25.793 --> 53:28.206
- Yeah.
- But you know about them?

53:28.344 --> 53:31.827
I know about them, I did not
know that she was engaged.

53:33.379 --> 53:37.448
I mean, I obviously want her
to be happy, obviously.

53:37.586 --> 53:39.034
I just...

53:41.103 --> 53:45.000
It's a lot harder to leave

53:45.137 --> 53:47.551
when you are married
and you have children.

53:47.689 --> 53:49.931
I think it just makes things
a lot more complicated.

53:50.068 --> 53:51.827
And when I was here,
one of the things

53:51.965 --> 53:54.827
I eventually said to my mom
in a moment of despair,

53:54.965 --> 53:57.379
and I don't know what
she thought about this,

53:57.517 --> 54:02.068
was that there was no way that
I would ever marry anyone

54:02.206 --> 54:04.448
that had anything to do
with this church.

54:04.586 --> 54:06.689
Because when
the elders took over,

54:06.827 --> 54:10.724
the way that the husbands
lord over their wives now,

54:10.862 --> 54:13.931
I just absolutely believe
that this place is toxic.

54:14.068 --> 54:16.551
So that's what...
When I think about Becca being,

54:16.689 --> 54:19.551
you know, subjected to that,
in any way...

54:20.896 --> 54:24.137
- It just makes me really sad.
- Mmm.

54:27.517 --> 54:28.689
Oh, Becca.

54:33.793 --> 54:39.793
And do you know Jonah is
engaged, did you know that?

54:46.206 --> 54:48.034
I feel so terrible.

54:49.793 --> 54:52.103
- Oh no, I'm sorry.

54:52.241 --> 54:55.620
Because I know this is
supposed to be happy news,

54:55.758 --> 54:58.103
and I really hope
that it is for them.

54:58.241 --> 55:01.517
I really, really do. I just...

55:03.655 --> 55:06.137
It just makes it obviously
a little less likely,

55:06.275 --> 55:08.068
or a lot less likely

55:08.206 --> 55:10.206
that I'll ever get to
have them back.

55:11.517 --> 55:13.310
So I feel so terrible...

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
that this is the response.

55:23.862 --> 55:26.068
I just love them
so much, you know.

55:26.206 --> 55:30.275
I know it's a very selfish hope,
in some ways,

55:30.413 --> 55:33.034
to have them out. I wouldn't
hope for them to leave

55:33.172 --> 55:36.724
if I didn't think that it was
for their own good, you know.

55:38.241 --> 55:40.965
It's a lot to take on board.

55:41.103 --> 55:43.793
- Oh god, I just wanna go
curl up and cry.

55:45.413 --> 55:47.000
- Do you wanna take a break?

55:48.482 --> 55:50.275
- I'm sorry.

56:09.827 --> 56:13.448
- I just don't understand
why it has to be this way.

56:15.241 --> 56:18.965
It is just a heartbreaking
waste.

56:19.103 --> 56:21.482
All these lost years.

56:28.103 --> 56:30.965
Grace said to our mom once,
"If there were a God,

56:31.103 --> 56:34.551
"why would he want it to be
this way for her daughters?"

56:34.689 --> 56:36.275
And she's our mother.

56:38.551 --> 56:40.517
I still don't have an answer.

56:51.827 --> 56:55.586
- Is Solvi doing OK?
- She's doing really well.

57:29.931 --> 57:31.689
- It would be difficult
to overstate

57:31.827 --> 57:33.620
the amount of grief
caused by Westboro

57:33.758 --> 57:36.655
and its doctrine of
divine hate over the years.

57:38.068 --> 57:41.206
A creed created
by a spiteful pastor,

57:41.344 --> 57:43.586
and passed down
through the generations,

57:43.724 --> 57:46.620
dividing families,
and denying feelings.

57:51.586 --> 57:53.689
But in my time back,
I'd also seen reasons

57:53.827 --> 57:56.241
to believe in the possibility
of change.

57:57.793 --> 58:00.862
Thanks in part to the death
of its founder,

58:01.000 --> 58:03.517
but also one ex-member's
willingness

58:03.655 --> 58:05.793
to fight hate with love,

58:05.931 --> 58:08.241
and division with engagement.

58:09.517 --> 58:10.586
- One point that I hope

58:10.724 --> 58:12.103
you'll take away from all this
is that

58:12.241 --> 58:15.034
when people are in the thrall
of poisonous ideology,

58:15.172 --> 58:17.793
it's really not all about
deliberate ill will,

58:17.931 --> 58:19.793
or lack of intelligence.

58:19.931 --> 58:22.241
It's about the unbelievable
destructiveness

58:22.379 --> 58:24.724
and staying power
of bad ideas.

58:24.862 --> 58:26.931
And the more of us who
are willing to reach out,

58:27.068 --> 58:29.413
to disagree without demonising,

58:29.551 --> 58:31.931
the more likely we are to
change hearts and minds,

58:32.068 --> 58:34.379
to heal divisions, and to
create a better society

58:34.517 --> 58:36.344
for all of us in the process.

58:36.482 --> 58:38.275
Thank you so much for having me.

58:46.310 --> 58:49.310
