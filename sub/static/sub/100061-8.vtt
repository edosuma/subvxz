11:37.363 --> 11:38.489
Definitely.
(chuckles)

11:38.572 --> 11:40.241
Hey, by the way,

11:40.324 --> 11:42.326
did you really have to go

11:42.410 --> 11:44.995
full Metta World Peace
on my girl out there?

11:45.079 --> 11:46.831
Come on, man.
Ball is life, baby.

11:46.914 --> 11:48.374
And besides, she's
tough enough.

11:48.457 --> 11:49.708
She can handle it.

11:51.836 --> 11:54.296
I appreciate you, World Peace.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.507
See you on the golf course,
Fat Man.

11:56.590 --> 11:58.384
Bring plenty of money.

11:58.467 --> 12:01.137
(laughs)

12:01.220 --> 12:03.180
Wise-ass.

12:03.264 --> 12:05.641
I've got to be honest with you,
Captain Grover.

12:05.724 --> 12:08.144
Siobhan's a special player.

12:08.227 --> 12:10.229
A very special player.

12:12.731 --> 12:13.816
And we'd love to
have her here at U.H.

12:13.899 --> 12:17.445
But...?

12:17.528 --> 12:19.989
There is a concern.

12:20.072 --> 12:21.282
And it's not
insignificant.

12:23.451 --> 12:27.246
(sighs)

12:29.582 --> 12:31.500
Okay, let's, uh, let's hear it.

12:35.421 --> 12:38.466
(door opens)

12:40.468 --> 12:43.012
So, they don't want me?

12:43.095 --> 12:46.182
Bonnie, now, why in the world
would you think that?

12:46.265 --> 12:49.393
Looked like you had bad news.

12:49.477 --> 12:50.519
(chuckles)
No, sweetheart. No.

12:50.603 --> 12:53.731
You were incredible.

12:53.814 --> 12:55.983
The coach says she's never
seen a player like you ever.

12:56.066 --> 12:58.360
Okay? And as a matter of fact,
she's talking about

12:58.444 --> 13:01.155
giving you a full ride at U.H.

13:01.238 --> 13:05.493
Like, a-a scholarship?
Yeah.

13:05.576 --> 13:07.495
But there is the matter
of the thing back home,

13:07.578 --> 13:08.746
and Coach Paul,

13:08.829 --> 13:09.914
well, she's wondering
whether or not

13:09.997 --> 13:12.249
you really want it bad enough.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.710
And quite frankly, Bonnie,
I mean that is the question

13:14.793 --> 13:17.379
that's on everybody's mind.
It's not like
how you think.

13:17.463 --> 13:21.717
Siobhan.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.678
You know that people that come
from where we come from

13:24.762 --> 13:26.138
barely get one,
let alone two chances at doing

13:26.222 --> 13:28.390
anything more
than just surviving.

13:28.474 --> 13:30.559
You think I don't know that?
Well, then,
why the hell

13:30.643 --> 13:33.020
would you do what you did?

13:33.103 --> 13:35.814
You are the number one high
school player in the nation.

13:35.898 --> 13:38.275
And you end up getting
in a-a fight with some girl

13:38.359 --> 13:40.236
and getting expelled
and not graduating? Why?

13:40.319 --> 13:41.612
I told you, it's not
like how you think.

13:41.695 --> 13:43.447
Siobhan.

13:43.531 --> 13:44.907
Your father's told me
about what's been going on

13:44.990 --> 13:46.492
with you lately.
My father don't know nothing

13:55.668 --> 13:57.753
about what's going on with me.

13:59.171 --> 14:00.339
(door closes)

14:00.422 --> 14:04.343
TANI:
Here we go.

14:06.512 --> 14:08.264
So our perp left the store and
he called a number in Hong Kong.

14:08.347 --> 14:10.599
Well, that's all you.
It's an address.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.226
2345 Malaki Avenue.

14:12.309 --> 14:13.894
That's not far from here.

14:21.026 --> 14:22.570
Yeah. Let's go.

14:22.653 --> 14:25.072
All right.

14:25.155 --> 14:26.740
We're gonna set a perimeter
before we breach.

14:26.824 --> 14:28.492
Tani, take the left side
of the house, Quinn,

14:28.576 --> 14:30.452
you take the right. All right?
I want you guys to hold security

14:30.536 --> 14:32.246
on that back door,
make sure nobody gets out.

14:32.329 --> 14:34.123
Once you're in position,
I'll take the front door.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.643
Copy that.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.729
I got movement inside the house.

15:12.870 --> 15:15.331
Stay sharp.

15:15.414 --> 15:16.707
Hands! Right now!

15:16.790 --> 15:18.792
Keep them right there.

15:18.876 --> 15:21.337
Richie Gormican, DEA.

15:21.420 --> 15:23.172
You all need to relax.

15:23.255 --> 15:25.549
Yeah? I'll relax when
you show me your ID.

15:25.633 --> 15:26.717
I'm reaching for my badge.

15:30.387 --> 15:32.306
Slowly.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.185
Tani.

15:36.268 --> 15:38.687
Yeah, we're good.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.606
Yeah, we're good.
Can we all chill out now?

15:40.689 --> 15:43.150
I got to say, I've had

15:44.276 --> 15:45.569
friendlier interactions
with Hawaii law enforcement.

15:45.653 --> 15:48.197
Have you?

15:48.280 --> 15:49.365
What are you
doing here?

15:49.448 --> 15:51.241
Well, my guess is looking
for the same

15:51.325 --> 15:52.701
piece of garbage as you.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.578
You mean this psycho?

15:54.662 --> 15:56.038
Oh, there's my boy.

15:57.081 --> 15:58.332
Does your boy have a name?

15:58.415 --> 15:59.208
Ben Tam.

15:59.291 --> 16:00.668
TANI:
We think he's trying

16:00.751 --> 16:02.336
to get off the island.

16:02.419 --> 16:04.380
Came here looking for help.

16:04.463 --> 16:05.714
Oh, he's not leaving the island.
Not yet, anyway.

16:05.798 --> 16:08.550
Why are you so sure?

16:08.634 --> 16:11.553
Well, because if he did,

16:11.637 --> 16:13.055
he'd be leaving a $100 million
dollars' worth of heroin

16:19.269 --> 16:21.355
somewhere out there
in the jungle.

16:21.438 --> 16:23.524
Based on flight data,
we're nearly at the point

16:23.607 --> 16:25.401
where the medevac chopper
picked up our perp.

16:25.484 --> 16:26.944
That ridge up ahead.

16:27.986 --> 16:28.987
JUNIOR:
Copy.

16:29.071 --> 16:32.241
You know, I got to admit.

16:32.324 --> 16:34.743
I was surprised to see Steve
back at work so soon.

16:34.827 --> 16:35.953
Yeah, well, you know how he is.
Yeah, well, I also know

16:36.036 --> 16:37.413
what it's like to try and deal

16:37.496 --> 16:39.248
with this kind
of trauma on your own.

16:39.331 --> 16:42.501
I mean, you think
you got a handle on things,

16:42.584 --> 16:43.711
and out of nowhere, you realize
you're not coping at all.

16:43.794 --> 16:45.254
Yeah, well,

16:45.337 --> 16:47.548
all we can do is keep
an eye on the guy

16:47.631 --> 16:48.590
and make sure
we're there for him.
Right.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.259
(beeping)

16:50.342 --> 16:52.386
Looks like this is it.

16:54.888 --> 16:57.141
JUNIOR:
All right.

16:57.224 --> 16:58.934
Well, there's a clear trail
up ahead

16:59.017 --> 17:01.353
just past that tree line
over there.

17:01.437 --> 17:03.188
Eddie. Take a good
sniff of that.

17:04.481 --> 17:06.233
All right. Go find.
(barking)

17:06.316 --> 17:07.025
GORMICAN:
I've been running
an undercover op

17:07.108 --> 17:09.653
against heroin traffickers

17:09.737 --> 17:10.988
moving product
out of Hong Kong.

17:11.070 --> 17:13.281
Six months working this crew,

17:13.365 --> 17:14.491
we were about to rewrite
DEA history.

17:14.575 --> 17:16.910
QUINN:
Is that a fact?

17:16.993 --> 17:18.912
Look, I'm not one
to undersell myself,

17:18.996 --> 17:20.289
but this would've been
the biggest drug haul

17:20.372 --> 17:21.498
Hawaii's ever seen.

17:21.582 --> 17:24.126
I even told my director,

17:24.209 --> 17:26.420
whatever size table you got in
mind for the press conference,

17:29.381 --> 17:31.300
you're gonna need a bigger one.

17:31.383 --> 17:32.843
You know, for all the drugs.

17:32.926 --> 17:34.636
Thank you for the clarification.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.138
Wow, I'm really
digging your vibe.

17:37.347 --> 17:38.974
STEVE:
So what happened?

17:39.057 --> 17:40.476
Well, five days ago,

17:40.559 --> 17:43.145
a Cessna loaded with
170 pounds of heroin

17:43.228 --> 17:45.355
was en route to a private
airstrip here on Oahu,

17:45.439 --> 17:49.359
with one of my guys
at the controls.

17:49.443 --> 17:51.820
I assume it crashed somewhere
in the Mokuleia Forest Reserve.

17:51.904 --> 17:54.990
Aerial searches of the area
turned up jack.

17:55.073 --> 17:57.493
The tree canopy's so thick,
you could lose a 747 in there.

17:57.576 --> 18:00.287
So how'd you end up here?

18:00.370 --> 18:02.998
Well, that's the real two mice,
one piece of cheese story.

18:03.081 --> 18:04.500
Got here the same way
you did.

18:04.583 --> 18:06.960
The past few days,
I've just been sitting,

18:07.044 --> 18:08.504
monitoring the cartel comms,
waiting for chatter

18:08.587 --> 18:11.215
about the shipment.

18:11.298 --> 18:13.467
I was up on the same
Hong Kong phone that Tam called

18:13.550 --> 18:14.426
from his burner.

18:14.510 --> 18:16.970
We are the mice in my analogy.

18:17.054 --> 18:18.847
The cheese was the lead,
the burner message.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.974
We got the analogy.
Just took way too long

18:21.058 --> 18:23.060
to get to the
explanation.

18:23.143 --> 18:26.480
She this salty all the time?

18:26.563 --> 18:28.398
Okay, so the Chinese cartel
sends Tam

18:28.482 --> 18:30.234
to this house because whoever
lives here is somehow connected

18:30.317 --> 18:31.527
to the business.

18:31.610 --> 18:34.822
Well, that was my theory.

18:34.905 --> 18:36.365
I just spoke to the owner
of the property.

18:36.448 --> 18:38.075
You're not gonna believe this.
He was renting it

18:44.957 --> 18:46.500
to a Sam Bishop.

18:46.583 --> 18:48.377
Why does everyone here look like

18:48.460 --> 18:50.170
they just heard Elvis
is still alive?

18:51.171 --> 18:52.089
Cullen's fixer lives here?

18:52.172 --> 18:54.216
Who the hell's Cullen?

18:54.299 --> 18:56.760
Currently, he's dead.
Before that, he was in the

18:56.844 --> 18:58.804
real estate/money laundering
business.

18:58.887 --> 19:00.055
He also dabbled in
murder-for-hire.
And this Bishop guy

19:00.138 --> 19:02.432
was his main hench.

19:02.516 --> 19:05.227
Okay, I'm all caught up.

19:05.310 --> 19:07.354
Didn't Cullen suggest there was
a bigger conspiracy going on?

19:07.437 --> 19:08.355
Yeah, he did, and this--
this proves it.

19:08.438 --> 19:09.231
I mean, this proves

19:09.314 --> 19:10.774
there's a wider
criminal network

19:10.858 --> 19:11.942
that connects
Cullen's right-hand man

19:12.025 --> 19:13.193
to the Asian heroin trade.

19:13.277 --> 19:15.362
GORMICAN:
And so this Bishop guy,

19:15.445 --> 19:16.363
I assume he has
access to resources?

19:16.446 --> 19:17.906
Men, guns.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.701
That would be a yes.

19:20.784 --> 19:22.744
So, it's safe to assume
that Bishop is accompanying Tam

19:22.828 --> 19:23.579
back into the jungle
to find that heroin.

19:23.662 --> 19:25.539
TANI: Adam and
Junior. If they

19:25.622 --> 19:27.583
track back
to the site of the crash...

19:27.666 --> 19:29.793
They could be walking
into some serious danger.

19:29.877 --> 19:30.919
(line ringing)

19:31.003 --> 19:32.504
This is Junior Reigns.
Please leave a message.

19:32.588 --> 19:33.922
All right,
Junior's not answering,

19:34.006 --> 19:35.465
which means they must be
out of cell range.

19:38.468 --> 19:40.762
We got to find them right now.

19:40.846 --> 19:43.599
Commander.

19:43.682 --> 19:45.392
Are we really letting this guy
tag along? I don't trust him.

19:45.475 --> 19:47.644
I don't trust him, either,
all right?

19:49.855 --> 19:51.398
But right now, he's our best
chance to get to Tam.

19:51.481 --> 19:53.275
(sighs)

19:53.358 --> 19:55.152
Still no response
from Adam or Junior.

19:59.531 --> 20:01.575
Try again, please.
You got it.

20:01.658 --> 20:03.785
You know, McGarrett, I was
really hoping to not like you.

20:03.869 --> 20:06.163
Still got time, pal.

20:06.246 --> 20:08.624
You know, what you did
down in Mexico...

20:08.707 --> 20:12.252
It's not a good look
when outsiders come in

20:13.086 --> 20:16.465
and take down a big bad
like Carmen Lucia.

20:16.548 --> 20:18.091
Makes it tough for pros like me.

20:18.175 --> 20:20.594
Yeah, well, everything
has a price,

20:20.677 --> 20:22.763
Isn't that right,
Agent Gormican?

20:22.846 --> 20:26.308
Yeah, it does.

20:26.391 --> 20:27.726
Hey, I heard about
what happened with your mom.

20:29.478 --> 20:31.480
And I'm sorry.

20:43.575 --> 20:44.493
I appreciate that. Thank you.

20:44.576 --> 20:47.621
(door opens)

20:47.704 --> 20:49.539
RENEE:
Hey, honey.

20:50.582 --> 20:51.625
So how were the tryouts?

20:56.129 --> 20:58.465
(whispers):
Where's Siobhan?

20:58.548 --> 20:59.675
(whispers): Babe, we need
to talk. Come with me, okay?

21:06.765 --> 21:08.767
Come on.

21:12.437 --> 21:16.024
(sighs)

21:16.108 --> 21:17.693
Okay, the coach has concerns
about the incidents

21:17.776 --> 21:19.027
surrounding Bonnie
getting expelled.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.445
You mean the fight.

21:23.156 --> 21:25.617
Yeah, but there's--

21:27.285 --> 21:28.996
Hey, listen,
you need to know this.

21:29.079 --> 21:29.997
Mike tells me that Siobhan's
fallen in with a gang.

21:30.080 --> 21:32.666
What?!

21:32.749 --> 21:33.583
You know the female faction
of the Apostles gang

21:33.667 --> 21:35.544
back in Chicago,
the Lady Apostles?

21:35.627 --> 21:37.879
Them. And I believe him.

21:37.963 --> 21:40.507
Because he said
the day after that fight,

21:40.590 --> 21:41.717
he found a .38 in her room.
Our Siobhan?

21:41.800 --> 21:43.510
I'm telling you.
No, no.

21:43.593 --> 21:47.014
Baby, that doesn't sound
like her at all.

21:47.097 --> 21:49.516
Look, I can-- I can see
a fight, maybe, but...
Babe.

21:49.599 --> 21:51.268
The girl's own father
said this to me, Reneé.
Look,

21:51.351 --> 21:54.062
I hear what you're saying.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.731
I know that these kids
out here are into...

21:55.814 --> 21:58.900
who knows what these days.

21:58.984 --> 22:00.402
But a gang, and hiding
a gun in her room?

22:00.485 --> 22:02.529
Why? Why would she

22:02.612 --> 22:04.489
get involved in that?
How would I know?

22:04.573 --> 22:07.200
I mean, she's got all of that
basketball ahead of her.

22:07.284 --> 22:08.326
Have you even spoken
to her about this?
Well, I tried.

22:08.410 --> 22:09.411
But that's not,
that's not the point.

22:09.494 --> 22:13.623
Listen, listen, calm down.

22:13.707 --> 22:15.709
The point is this:
despite all that,

22:15.792 --> 22:18.920
they really want her at U.H.

22:19.004 --> 22:20.380
I'm talking about a full
scholarship, the whole nine.

22:20.464 --> 22:22.924
She's that good.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.097
Baby, that's great.
So-- so what's the problem?

22:29.181 --> 22:31.767
All right, here it is, okay?

22:31.850 --> 22:33.560
There's a stipulation
on that scholarship.

22:33.643 --> 22:35.103
In order for Siobhan
to get this scholarship,

22:35.187 --> 22:36.772
she wouldn't be able

22:36.855 --> 22:38.815
to stay on campus.

22:38.899 --> 22:40.942
She would have to stay with us.

22:41.026 --> 22:43.737
The coach thinks me being
with Five-O would provide her

22:43.820 --> 22:45.572
the necessary
positive influence.
Well, that makes sense.

22:45.655 --> 22:48.408
Well, sure,
it makes sense, Reneé.

22:48.492 --> 22:50.577
But it would be
a huge commitment.

22:50.660 --> 22:52.412
And from the both of us.

22:52.496 --> 22:53.413
The two of us would
be the ones keeping Bonnie

22:53.497 --> 22:55.332
on the straight and narrow.

22:55.415 --> 22:57.125
And now that
we've downsized here,

22:57.209 --> 22:58.794
we've barely got
enough room in this place

22:58.877 --> 23:00.337
for the two of us.

23:00.420 --> 23:02.089
I mean, can you imagine
what it'd be like?

23:02.172 --> 23:03.799
We'd have Siobhan here,
and then Will and Samantha

23:03.882 --> 23:05.592
are gonna be flipping coins
over who gets

23:05.675 --> 23:07.302
the pull-out
sofa when they visit.

23:07.385 --> 23:09.930
Between that and whatever it is

23:11.056 --> 23:13.850
that Bonnie's got going
on back home, I just...

23:13.934 --> 23:15.310
...I don't think
it's gonna work out.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.646
I mean, how could it?

23:17.729 --> 23:19.648
This is my fault,
because I-I didn't,

23:19.731 --> 23:22.359
I didn't even
think this through, man.

23:26.696 --> 23:28.824
That's on me. I just...

23:28.907 --> 23:30.617
Babe, you should've seen her.

23:30.700 --> 23:33.662
Aw.

23:33.745 --> 23:37.791
She goes up against
a former NBA player,

23:37.874 --> 23:40.293
and I'm telling you,
she gave homeboy the business.

23:40.377 --> 23:42.671
(laughs)

23:42.754 --> 23:44.798
Now I got to go back there
and put a sledgehammer

23:46.424 --> 23:49.010
to this kid's dreams.

23:49.094 --> 23:51.138
You're wasting time.

23:51.221 --> 23:53.807
What are you talking about?

23:53.890 --> 23:54.933
All those words.

23:55.016 --> 23:57.144
You're doing this.

23:57.227 --> 23:59.521
You know it and I know it.

23:59.604 --> 24:01.022
N-- Uh, how,

24:01.106 --> 24:03.358
I-I don't actually know,

24:03.442 --> 24:05.777
but I'll tell you
something I do know.

24:05.861 --> 24:07.696
You and Mike have been tight
since the fifth grade.

24:07.779 --> 24:11.032
Now, if Siobhan
needs our help

24:11.116 --> 24:13.368
after everything that she's been
through, we will figure it out.

24:13.451 --> 24:15.370
The two of us.

24:15.453 --> 24:17.873
Besides,

24:17.956 --> 24:20.167
with the money we saved
from selling the house,

24:20.250 --> 24:23.336
we can afford
to slip off

24:23.420 --> 24:26.631
from time to time
to a nice hotel.

24:26.715 --> 24:29.426
You know,
if we need some privacy.

24:32.637 --> 24:34.556
(laughs)

24:34.639 --> 24:36.892
Come here, babe.
(whispers):
That's my baby.

24:36.975 --> 24:39.561
You're a hell of woman.
You know that?

24:39.644 --> 24:40.854
Yeah, I do.

24:40.937 --> 24:42.230
Now let's just go call her in

24:42.314 --> 24:43.565
and tell her about
this, all right?

24:46.943 --> 24:48.403
Yeah.

24:48.486 --> 24:50.989
Bonnie, want to come out
here for a second?

24:56.328 --> 24:57.829
We need to talk to you.

25:03.168 --> 25:05.086
Siobhan?

25:05.170 --> 25:06.421
She's gone.

25:06.504 --> 25:08.924
What?
She's gone, Renee.

25:09.007 --> 25:10.675
I got to go find her.
Well, uh...

25:16.556 --> 25:18.600
(Eddie barking)

25:18.683 --> 25:19.809
(whining, barking)

25:19.893 --> 25:21.228
Hey.

25:22.395 --> 25:24.314
What you got, Eddie?

25:24.397 --> 25:25.357
Well, I'm gonna go
out on a limb here

25:25.440 --> 25:27.442
and say this is how our perp

25:27.525 --> 25:30.278
found himself stranded
in the middle of the jungle.

25:30.362 --> 25:32.447
Yeah, he did a pretty good job
camouflaging it.

25:32.530 --> 25:34.241
Question is, why?

25:41.665 --> 25:42.958
Do you smell that?

25:43.041 --> 25:45.001
Okay, we got a dead pilot.

25:46.544 --> 25:47.587
Looks like he died on impact.

25:57.305 --> 25:58.223
Check this out.

25:58.306 --> 26:00.475
Heroin.

26:00.558 --> 26:01.935
Okay, well, that explains
why our perp spent

26:02.018 --> 26:03.979
so long trying
to cover this thing up.

26:04.062 --> 26:06.314
He didn't want anyone
getting to the cargo.

26:06.398 --> 26:07.315
(phone ringing)

26:07.399 --> 26:08.483
Hey, Quinn...

26:08.566 --> 26:09.484
QUINN:
Junior, be advised,

26:09.567 --> 26:10.443
we have reason to believe

26:10.527 --> 26:11.653
that our killer is leading

26:11.736 --> 26:12.654
a heavily-armed group
to your location.

26:12.737 --> 26:13.655
We're inbound, but we're

26:13.738 --> 26:14.823
at least ten minutes out.

26:14.906 --> 26:16.324
All right, copy that.

26:16.408 --> 26:17.659
(engine approaches)

26:17.742 --> 26:19.911
Junior. We got company.

26:19.995 --> 26:21.621
Quinn, we have hostiles inbound.

26:21.705 --> 26:23.748
Find cover and hold your
position until we get there.

26:28.378 --> 26:30.755
Roger that. We got to move.
Yeah.

26:44.811 --> 26:46.855
♪ ♪

26:46.938 --> 26:48.940
I thought you said
you covered it up.

26:50.275 --> 26:51.693
I did.

26:52.986 --> 26:54.988
It's all still here.

27:00.618 --> 27:01.953
Wait a second.

27:10.253 --> 27:12.839
Somebody's been here.

27:12.922 --> 27:15.050
BISHOP:
I got fresh tracks.

27:15.133 --> 27:16.343
Move out. Search the area.

27:16.426 --> 27:18.345
HENCHMAN:
Come on, let's go.

27:23.808 --> 27:24.809
You heard him. Move.

27:25.810 --> 27:27.187
Go, go, go!

27:27.270 --> 27:28.772
(twig snaps)

27:32.650 --> 27:33.651
They're over there!
Fire!

27:42.369 --> 27:43.411
(screams)

27:47.165 --> 27:48.792
Flank them, flank them!

27:49.793 --> 27:51.378
(gun clicking)

27:52.379 --> 27:53.588
I'm out.

28:02.305 --> 28:03.890
You stay behind cover.

28:19.864 --> 28:21.366
How many you got?
I'm almost out.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.035
(shouting)

28:26.704 --> 28:27.914
(growling)

28:28.915 --> 28:29.958
TANI:
I got Ben Tam!

28:30.041 --> 28:31.167
He's dead!

28:31.251 --> 28:32.919
I got eyes on Bishop.

28:33.002 --> 28:35.922
(strained exhale)

28:36.005 --> 28:38.299
No, no, no. No, you
don't get to die.

28:38.383 --> 28:39.926
Medevac out here right now.
Let's go.

28:40.009 --> 28:41.511
This is Quinn Liu,
Five-O Task Force,

28:45.932 --> 28:46.766
requesting
immediate medevac.

28:46.850 --> 28:48.977
STEVE:
Thank you.

28:49.060 --> 28:50.311
QUINN:
Bishop is on his
way to Kings.

28:50.395 --> 28:51.521
He's unconscious but stable.
They're gonna call us as soon

28:51.604 --> 28:54.274
as he wakes up.
Ah, that's great news.

28:54.357 --> 28:56.776
Not a bad day at the
office, McGarrett.

28:56.860 --> 28:57.861
Not bad.
Thank you for the
assist on this one.

28:57.944 --> 28:58.862
Sergeant Liu.

28:58.945 --> 29:00.363
It's been a pleasure.

29:01.739 --> 29:03.366
That's a word for it.

29:03.450 --> 29:05.410
Excuse me. I'm gonna
go check on our exfil.

29:05.493 --> 29:06.995
Okay.

29:07.078 --> 29:08.204
So, what's the status on Bishop?

29:08.288 --> 29:09.372
Once he's stable,
they're gonna let me know.

29:09.456 --> 29:10.999
I'm gonna head out
to Kings Medical,

29:11.082 --> 29:13.001
have a little chat with him.

29:13.084 --> 29:14.752
Now, that's the kind
of ending I like.

29:14.836 --> 29:17.881
Everybody gets to go
home with a win.

29:17.964 --> 29:20.550
Right.
Marshal Service was kind
enough to loan some guys out.

29:20.633 --> 29:23.011
Looks like they're just about
done loading up the truck.

29:23.094 --> 29:24.554
I'm gonna get this
haul back to HQ.

29:24.637 --> 29:26.014
I've got that big table

29:26.097 --> 29:27.724
and all those photographers
waiting for me.

29:27.807 --> 29:30.351
Yeah, you do.
Yeah, but don't
you worry,

29:30.435 --> 29:31.978
McGarrett, I'll be sure to give
a shout out to Five-O.

29:32.061 --> 29:32.979
Oh, you don't have
to do that, man.

29:56.085 --> 29:57.212
It's, uh, just our job.

29:57.295 --> 29:58.588
(door opens)

29:58.671 --> 30:01.216
Boss, this a good time?

30:01.299 --> 30:02.217
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on. Of course.

30:02.300 --> 30:03.176
I just got
the preliminary report

30:03.259 --> 30:06.054
back from the M.E.'s office.

30:06.137 --> 30:07.347
The dead DEA agent
found on board the plane

30:07.430 --> 30:10.558
was identified as Carl Brauer.

30:10.642 --> 30:12.018
Thing is, according to the DEA,
Brauer had been on suspension

30:12.101 --> 30:13.561
for the last six months

30:13.645 --> 30:16.481
pending an Internal Affairs
investigation.

30:16.564 --> 30:19.400
Which means there's no way
he should've been on that plane.

30:19.484 --> 30:20.777
There's something else.

30:20.860 --> 30:22.862
Turns out Brauer's
former partner

30:24.030 --> 30:25.573
is none other
than Richie Gormican.

30:25.657 --> 30:28.034
Get the Marshal's office
on the phone.

30:29.536 --> 30:31.287
Have them track
that car right now.

30:32.830 --> 30:35.041
(siren wailing)

30:35.124 --> 30:36.417
(tires screeching)

30:36.501 --> 30:37.585
We have eyes on the vehicle.

30:44.759 --> 30:46.594
Approaching.

30:49.722 --> 30:51.474
Clear.

30:58.565 --> 31:00.733
I got two dead marshals
and the drugs are gone.

31:00.817 --> 31:02.443
HPD has an APB
out on Gormican.

31:02.527 --> 31:04.445
All ports and airports
are on alert.

31:04.529 --> 31:06.948
Pull every single
resource that we have.

31:07.031 --> 31:08.491
This man does not leave the
island. Adam, what do you got?

31:08.575 --> 31:09.742
ADAM:
I called Brauer's supervisor
at the DEA.

31:09.826 --> 31:12.912
Turns out he was
put on ice

31:12.996 --> 31:14.122
because he was suspected of
side-dealing with Serbian mafia

31:14.205 --> 31:15.748
working out of New York.

31:15.832 --> 31:17.083
I put up a flag up for
all known associates

31:17.166 --> 31:18.084
of this organization

31:18.167 --> 31:20.670
and got a hit.

31:20.753 --> 31:22.088
This crew just touched down
in a chartered plane

31:22.171 --> 31:23.047
at a private airfield

31:23.131 --> 31:25.258
in Makiki,
all using fake IDs.

31:25.341 --> 31:27.260
Well, if these guys
are the original buyers,

31:27.343 --> 31:29.846
then Gormican is still looking
to make Tam's sale.

31:29.929 --> 31:31.556
We need to get to that plane
before the deal goes down.

31:37.770 --> 31:39.772
Because once it does, he's gone.

31:51.868 --> 31:52.785
(indistinct chatter)

31:52.869 --> 31:54.537
Five-O!
Hands!

31:54.621 --> 31:55.997
Right now!
Move! Move!

31:56.080 --> 31:57.999
STEVE:
Behind your head,
interlock your fingers.

31:58.082 --> 31:59.000
Turn around.
Turn around, get on your knees.

31:59.083 --> 32:00.668
Get on your knees.

32:00.752 --> 32:02.712
Cross your ankles.

32:02.795 --> 32:05.131
(tires screeching)

32:06.132 --> 32:08.635
Don't move.

32:10.803 --> 32:12.180
Don't move.

32:12.263 --> 32:15.850
Well, I'm not
gonna lie:

32:15.933 --> 32:18.311
things are about to get
much worse for you.

32:19.562 --> 32:21.147
I know it's probably hard
to believe, but, uh...

32:21.230 --> 32:22.857
...they are.

32:41.334 --> 32:43.127
Trust me.

32:45.129 --> 32:46.047
(siren whoops)

32:46.130 --> 32:48.049
(exhales)

32:48.132 --> 32:49.926
Just... keep going.

32:50.009 --> 32:53.137
(turn signal clicking)

32:53.221 --> 32:55.264
Keep going, we're almost there.

33:16.077 --> 33:17.954
Sorry, Miss.
I can't do that.

33:18.037 --> 33:21.582
Tell me,

33:21.666 --> 33:23.376
j-just how ungrateful
can you be, Siobhan?

33:23.459 --> 33:25.086
You just up and take off,

33:25.169 --> 33:27.755
nobody knows
where the hell you are,

33:27.839 --> 33:31.092
whether you're alive or
laying in a ditch someplace?

33:31.175 --> 33:34.262
You know, I go
and I set up this tryout

33:34.345 --> 33:37.223
for you,

33:37.306 --> 33:39.600
and with Metta World Peace.
Do you have

33:39.684 --> 33:41.936
any idea,
I mean do you even realize

33:42.019 --> 33:44.564
what a huge ask that was?

33:44.647 --> 33:47.275
Do you even care?

33:47.358 --> 33:50.486
You know, not to mention
I get the coach from U.H.

33:50.570 --> 33:52.613
to take a chance on you
and give you another shot

33:52.697 --> 33:53.781
after everything
you done back home.

33:53.865 --> 33:54.991
I told you, it ain't
like you think.

33:55.074 --> 33:56.075
Oh, Bonnie, please.

33:56.159 --> 33:58.286
How many times you gonna
play that song?

33:58.369 --> 34:01.289
You sitting here acting like
you want to help me,

34:01.372 --> 34:05.084
like you got my back,

34:05.168 --> 34:07.754
when you really think I'm
some wannabe gangbanging thug.

34:07.837 --> 34:10.089
You don't even
want me here.

34:10.172 --> 34:13.134
You don't know
what you're talking about.

34:13.217 --> 34:15.011
What? Like how I think?

34:15.094 --> 34:18.097
I heard you! All this time

34:18.181 --> 34:19.766
I'm thinking I can trust you,
but I can't trust you.

34:19.849 --> 34:21.516
Not you,
not my father.

34:23.770 --> 34:25.688
I can't trust nobody.

34:25.772 --> 34:29.150
And you just as bad as he is.

34:29.233 --> 34:31.444
Wait a minute, now.
Your father is the only reason

34:31.527 --> 34:33.821
your ungrateful ass
is even here.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.989
He's the one back there
trying to keep you

34:36.074 --> 34:38.242
from flushing your life
down the toilet.

34:38.326 --> 34:41.661
By telling you I'm in a gang
and I got a gun?

34:41.746 --> 34:43.206
What the hell is the matter with
you? He's your father, Siobhan.

34:43.289 --> 34:44.456
And I'm the one
that's responsible for you

34:44.540 --> 34:47.293
while you're out here.

34:47.376 --> 34:48.377
Of course he told me everything.

34:48.460 --> 34:51.839
Then why didn't he tell you

34:53.757 --> 34:55.510
that I took that gun
to the police station on Kedzie?

34:55.592 --> 34:57.512
He knows I did it.

34:59.055 --> 35:00.181
He's the one
that took me down there.

35:00.264 --> 35:03.184
This girl
at my school,

35:03.267 --> 35:06.145
Romella Bradley,
is in the Lady Apostles.

35:06.229 --> 35:08.189
She's been pressing my friend
Tianna to crew up with them.

35:08.272 --> 35:10.274
When she wouldn't do it,
I found out Romella

35:12.276 --> 35:15.154
was gonna shoot Tianna
after school one day.

35:15.238 --> 35:16.781
I swiped that gun
from her backpack.

35:16.864 --> 35:19.325
She came at me,

35:19.408 --> 35:21.244
pretty much knowing I did it,
but ain't none of them

35:21.327 --> 35:22.203
gangbangers tough
without a gun,

35:22.286 --> 35:25.331
and I beat her ass.

35:25.414 --> 35:27.667
That's how I got expelled.

35:27.750 --> 35:29.210
Because protecting my friend
meant more to me

35:29.293 --> 35:31.295
than playing ball,

35:38.177 --> 35:41.264
still does.

35:41.347 --> 35:42.682
Well... well, Bonnie, if that's
the real story of what happened,

35:42.765 --> 35:44.016
why-why didn't you just,
you know...

35:44.100 --> 35:45.893
What?

35:45.977 --> 35:49.272
Tell the school what happened?

35:49.355 --> 35:50.356
Because they don't care.

35:50.439 --> 35:54.277
They don't see us.

35:54.360 --> 35:55.486
We pass, we fail,
they don't give a damn about us.

35:55.570 --> 35:58.239
And my father
don't see me either.

35:58.322 --> 36:00.074
All he sees is a chance to live
out his dreams through me

36:00.157 --> 36:01.701
because he never made it
to the pros.

36:01.784 --> 36:04.453
And you,

36:04.537 --> 36:06.789
him, everybody got my life
planned out for me.

36:10.376 --> 36:12.795
Nobody cares
about what I want.

36:16.382 --> 36:18.759
Bonnie, what do you want?

36:18.843 --> 36:20.970
I want to be a cop, Uncle Lou.

36:22.346 --> 36:25.433
Because of you.

36:28.853 --> 36:30.521
I wanted to be a cop
s-since I was five years old.

36:30.605 --> 36:31.731
Bon-Bon.

36:31.814 --> 36:34.317
Hi.

36:34.400 --> 36:35.443
Hey, girl.

36:35.526 --> 36:37.278
Oh.

36:37.361 --> 36:41.115
Shh.

36:41.199 --> 36:42.325
We have to be really quiet
'cause Momma's asleep, okay?

36:42.408 --> 36:44.785
Wait a second.

36:44.869 --> 36:46.787
Did you fix your own hair

36:46.871 --> 36:48.456
and get dressed by yourself

36:48.539 --> 36:51.125
when Momma was asleep?
Yes.

36:51.208 --> 36:51.959
When did you get to be
such a big girl?

36:52.043 --> 36:56.172
I'll tell you what,

36:56.255 --> 36:58.215
you want to go
to Uncle Lou's house

36:58.299 --> 36:59.634
and get something to eat?
Yeah.

36:59.717 --> 37:01.135
You know Uncle Lou
got everything at his house,

37:01.219 --> 37:02.470
and Samantha's there.

37:02.553 --> 37:04.722
We'll have
a good time.

37:13.522 --> 37:15.650
Where are your shoes?
You have your shoes?

37:15.733 --> 37:18.778
Let me have
your shoes.

37:18.861 --> 37:22.323
I got to pick you up. How much
you weigh, about 500 pounds?

37:22.406 --> 37:24.450
Come on. Listen,
you got to be really quiet.

37:24.533 --> 37:26.327
Let me have your shoes.

37:26.410 --> 37:29.497
We gonna go over
Uncle Lou's house,

37:32.875 --> 37:36.504
and Uncle Lou is gonna make
that baby something to eat.

37:36.587 --> 37:39.507
I'll never forget how safe
I felt with you that night.

37:39.590 --> 37:41.676
Yeah, I'll never forget

37:41.759 --> 37:43.594
how happy Samantha was
that you were

37:45.388 --> 37:47.807
coming to stay
with us.

37:50.810 --> 37:52.353
Well, Bonnie...

37:52.436 --> 37:54.480
...if you really
want to

37:54.563 --> 37:56.357
find your way
into law enforcement,

38:00.444 --> 38:02.071
then I want to help
you get there.

38:02.154 --> 38:03.280
What?

38:03.364 --> 38:06.867
What about my father?

38:06.951 --> 38:09.453
You're old enough to make your
own plans for your life now.

38:09.537 --> 38:12.832
You know, when
the time is right,

38:19.463 --> 38:20.423
I'll help you square
things with your father.

38:21.841 --> 38:24.385
Aw.

38:24.468 --> 38:26.679
You're not gonna start
crying again, are you?

38:26.762 --> 38:28.764
You was crying, too.

38:28.848 --> 38:30.683
No, no.

38:30.766 --> 38:32.768
Mm.
You know, I-I...

38:35.438 --> 38:37.356
Hmm.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.442
All right, wise-ass, let's go.

38:41.444 --> 38:44.238
Come on,
get in the car.

38:44.321 --> 38:46.365
You was the only one crying.
I had something in my eye.

38:56.208 --> 38:58.919

Introduce you to some of these
folks, these clowns I work with.

39:01.088 --> 39:01.797

I am of you today?
Thanks.

39:01.881 --> 39:04.467

39:06.510 --> 39:08.095
Okay, listen, everybody,
this here is Siobhan.

39:08.179 --> 39:10.097

Uncle Lou.

Oh, jazz hands!
GROVER: Oh, my gosh. Okay.

39:11.515 --> 39:12.933
Everybody, this is Bonnie.

39:13.017 --> 39:15.102
Bonnie, everybody.
Bonnie's my niece.

39:15.186 --> 39:17.897
She's visiting from Chicago,

39:17.980 --> 39:19.565
and I found out that Bonnie
wants to be a copper.

39:19.648 --> 39:21.984
(Junior cheers)
Oh, hey.

39:22.068 --> 39:25.071
How cool is that? Hi,
I'm Tani. Nice to meet you.
Hi.

39:25.154 --> 39:26.447
Hi. Quinn.
Nice to meet you, Bonnie.
Nice to meet you.

39:26.530 --> 39:27.782
Okay, have a seat, Bon.
Uh, Cap,

39:27.865 --> 39:29.283
just before you sit down, uh,

39:29.366 --> 39:31.577
just want to get this
off my chest.

39:31.660 --> 39:33.746
You guys were hanging out
with Metta World Peace?

39:33.829 --> 39:35.247
How the hell did you guys
find out about that?

39:35.331 --> 39:37.750
JUNIOR: Uh, because
I love the guy, and he's

39:37.833 --> 39:40.461
an amazing advocate
for mental health, and he's one

39:40.544 --> 39:42.755
of the best
basketball players ever.

39:42.838 --> 39:44.131
By the way, where are
our autographed balls?

39:44.215 --> 39:46.092
Back the truck up.

39:46.175 --> 39:48.636
(laughter)
Let's get back to

39:48.719 --> 39:49.637
how are y'all all up
in my business on my day off?

39:49.720 --> 39:51.806
ADAM: All right,
come on, Lou,

39:51.889 --> 39:52.848
first of all,
nothing's a secret on this rock.

39:52.932 --> 39:55.226
You know that.
I guess not.

39:55.309 --> 39:57.144
And second of all,
you're at a table full of cops,

39:57.228 --> 39:58.479
so there's definitely
no secrets here.

39:58.562 --> 39:59.814
Yeah, so cut to the chase, man,

39:59.897 --> 40:01.857
how do you know
Metta World Peace?

40:01.941 --> 40:04.110
And how the hell
does he end up owing you?

40:04.193 --> 40:05.111
Well, that is a very long story,
which I will tell

40:05.194 --> 40:07.822
the condensed
version of,

40:07.905 --> 40:10.616
but first, I need to get
my niece some food. Hey,

40:10.699 --> 40:13.869
Big Fella, can we get, uh, some
grinds for my little niece here?

40:13.953 --> 40:15.830
One ono grind coming up
for Baby Chicago.
My man.

40:15.913 --> 40:18.707
I'll be right back.
All right.

40:18.791 --> 40:20.000
Back when, uh, Metta World Peace
was known as Ron Artest,

40:20.084 --> 40:21.919
he played for Chicago...

40:30.761 --> 40:32.721
(car door opens)

40:32.805 --> 40:35.850
I trusted him too quickly.

40:35.933 --> 40:38.602
Things were moving fast.
That guy fooled all of us.

40:38.686 --> 40:39.687
No, I should've seen the angles.

40:39.770 --> 40:44.316
Am I missing
something?

40:44.400 --> 40:46.193
I mean, 'cause last time
I checked, we got Gormican.

40:46.277 --> 40:47.695
Took out multiple
Serbian gang members,

40:47.778 --> 40:48.863
stopped 100 mil
of heroin

40:48.946 --> 40:51.532
from hitting the streets.
I mean, that happens

40:51.615 --> 40:53.909
to anybody else, and that is
a great day for their career.

40:53.993 --> 40:56.871
I mean, that's not even
the end of it.

40:58.831 --> 41:01.584
I heard that Bishop
is getting released from ICU.

41:01.667 --> 41:04.086
So, as soon as he's conscious,
he'll talk,

41:04.170 --> 41:05.588
and we can get some answers
on who's behind all this.

41:05.671 --> 41:07.965
Maybe even shed some light

41:10.301 --> 41:13.304
on that conspiracy
that Cullen was talking about.

41:14.305 --> 41:16.557
You're right. You're right.

41:16.640 --> 41:18.225
So, why don't you...

41:18.309 --> 41:20.853
come on over there.

41:21.979 --> 41:23.564
Grab some food before
those jackals eat it all.
(chuckles)

41:23.647 --> 41:25.983
Yeah, I will.

41:26.066 --> 41:28.110
