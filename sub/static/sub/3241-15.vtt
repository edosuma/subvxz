19:38.120 --> 19:39.406
(CHUCKLES)

19:46.400 --> 19:48.448
You're a bold lass, asking him to stay.

19:48.520 --> 19:49.521
I was afraid if I didn't,

19:49.600 --> 19:51.090
he might have come up with it himself.

19:52.720 --> 19:56.202
We have to find keys
and a map to this godforsaken place.

20:05.320 --> 20:07.004
RANDALL: May I call you Jamie?

20:13.640 --> 20:15.051
I care not.

20:16.800 --> 20:19.644
But if ye're expecting me to beg for my life,

20:20.480 --> 20:22.130
you'll be sorely disappointed.

20:22.240 --> 20:24.766
No, that would be a waste of both our time.

20:25.400 --> 20:28.643
I am unable to save you now,
even if I wished to.

20:29.280 --> 20:33.968
Our time together here
is but a momentary reprieve.

20:34.040 --> 20:35.041
Well, dinna bother.

20:35.560 --> 20:38.245
I prefer the noose to yer company.

20:39.160 --> 20:42.209
Is that true? Why?

20:42.480 --> 20:44.847
Do I make you uncomfortable?

20:47.320 --> 20:50.483
Do I haunt your dreams since Fort William?

20:52.960 --> 20:55.486
When you awaken in the middle of the night,

20:56.440 --> 20:58.920
shaken and sweating,

21:00.600 --> 21:03.285
is it my face you see
looming in the darkness?

21:03.760 --> 21:04.761
Tell me.

21:06.480 --> 21:08.482
When you lie upon your wife

21:08.920 --> 21:13.005
and her hands trace the scars on your back,

21:15.360 --> 21:16.361
do you ever think of me

21:21.640 --> 21:22.641
and soften?

21:23.160 --> 21:24.605
What is it you want from me, Randall?

21:26.920 --> 21:28.729
I want you to admit the truth to yourself.

21:28.800 --> 21:31.007
- And what would that be?
- That you escaped Fort William

21:31.080 --> 21:32.844
but you did not escape me.

21:34.040 --> 21:38.045
Surrender this pride that you hide behind

21:38.880 --> 21:43.488
and admit that even now, you're terrified.

21:45.160 --> 21:46.764
Admit it.

21:47.800 --> 21:51.361
Admit that one simple thing
and I will give you something in return.

21:53.480 --> 21:55.084
A final gift.

22:03.320 --> 22:04.765
A gift?

22:05.360 --> 22:06.850
The noose

22:09.200 --> 22:11.168
is such an ignoble ending.

22:12.240 --> 22:14.129
Give me what I ask

22:14.400 --> 22:17.563
and I will give you
the death that you deserve.

22:18.520 --> 22:21.171
Clean, honorable

22:22.960 --> 22:24.610
and of your own choosing.

22:27.040 --> 22:28.690
You could have a Roman death.

22:29.360 --> 22:32.170
You could fall on your sword like Brutus.

22:32.680 --> 22:37.242
Or maybe a Greek demise.
Socrates took hemlock.

22:42.760 --> 22:43.761
No.

22:45.560 --> 22:50.600
Perhaps you do not want
to see my face at the end.

22:51.440 --> 22:53.044
I understand.

22:56.040 --> 23:00.204
I can simply slit your throat from behind.

23:01.400 --> 23:03.004
It's messy, but...

23:04.680 --> 23:06.444
The choice is yours.

23:21.160 --> 23:23.766
How will I ever choose?

23:27.080 --> 23:29.401
But choose you must.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.401
First, you must give me your surrender.

23:33.080 --> 23:34.445
Make no mistake.

23:34.640 --> 23:38.406
I will have your surrender
before you leave this world.

23:47.960 --> 23:50.804
Claire, we've looked all over. There's no map.

23:51.040 --> 23:52.007
Well, what good are keys

23:52.080 --> 23:53.525
if we don't know where he's being held?

23:53.840 --> 23:55.524
Lass, we don't have the time.

23:55.920 --> 23:57.729
I just need a few more minutes!

23:58.800 --> 24:00.848
HEAD JAILOR: Thought I'd
check in on you, Mrs. Beauchamp,

24:18.760 --> 24:20.762

- Wait for me. I'll come with you.

24:20.840 --> 24:21.887
No.

24:22.560 --> 24:24.562
If I get caught, I can say that

24:24.640 --> 24:26.688
you quarreled with the jailor
and I fled for help.

24:26.800 --> 24:28.131
Well, what will I tell them at the gate?

24:28.480 --> 24:31.006
Tell them that I
sent you out to get a gift for Sir Fletcher.

24:31.080 --> 24:33.287
Remember, you work for
an Englishwoman of noble birth.

24:33.360 --> 24:37.001
And you remember, ye've got less than an
hour before Sir Fletcher returns.

24:37.520 --> 24:39.443

40:44.480 --> 40:45.481
Aye.

40:46.600 --> 40:49.410
Will you allow me
a brief test of your sincerity?

40:58.960 --> 41:01.042
Your hand. Lay it upon the table.

41:09.560 --> 41:11.164
No, the ruined one.

41:12.720 --> 41:16.645
- No! Don't do it!
- Silence her, or I will.

41:16.720 --> 41:19.200
Claire, please.

41:21.200 --> 41:22.201
(GRUNTS)

41:28.320 --> 41:29.560
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

41:47.160 --> 41:49.811
- No, no!
- Claire, no. No.

41:49.880 --> 41:51.086

(SCREAMING IN PAIN)

42:43.960 --> 42:44.961
Shh.

42:49.480 --> 42:50.720
Now kiss me.

43:02.240 --> 43:03.765
(GRUNTING IN RESISTANCE)

43:12.640 --> 43:14.085
Take her away.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.765
We will remember this moment
for the rest of our lives.

43:20.720 --> 43:22.051
Take her away.

43:22.720 --> 43:24.006
(CLAIRE CRYING) No.

43:25.120 --> 43:26.929
No, no!

43:28.440 --> 43:30.602
No, let me say goodbye!

43:34.240 --> 43:36.049
I can't leave you.

43:36.120 --> 43:38.521
Yes, you will. Do as I say.

43:38.600 --> 43:40.125
(WEEPING)

43:40.280 --> 43:41.964
I love you, <i>mo nighean donn.</i>

44:04.640 --> 44:06.290
I shall return shortly.

44:14.440 --> 44:15.441
Walk.

44:22.840 --> 44:25.764
I recently heard
an extraordinary rumor about you.

44:26.840 --> 44:29.684
There was a trial held at Cranesmuir.

44:30.320 --> 44:32.163
You were accused of being a witch.

44:36.240 --> 44:37.526
Yes.

44:42.360 --> 44:45.409
Witch I am.

44:50.200 --> 44:52.407
And I curse you.

44:54.480 --> 44:57.370
I curse you with knowledge, Jack Randall.

44:59.000 --> 45:02.482
I give you the hour

45:02.560 --> 45:03.766
of your death.

45:06.400 --> 45:10.200
Jonathan Wolverton Randall.

45:11.520 --> 45:15.411
Born September 3rd, 1705.

47:01.320 --> 47:03.971

(RANDALL GASPS SOFTLY)

(SIGHS)

48:35.760 --> 48:39.048
How does it feel to be alive,

48:40.800 --> 48:43.087
yet wear so much dead flesh?

49:03.200 --> 49:04.440
Shall we begin?

49:13.520 --> 49:14.806
Murtagh!

49:18.440 --> 49:19.441
Willie!

49:20.680 --> 49:22.011

- (GASPS)

49:47.320 --> 49:48.890
You shut your gab, woman.

49:49.360 --> 49:51.601
Ye want to bring the Redcoats down on us?

50:05.120 --> 50:06.531
We have to go back for him.

50:07.960 --> 50:11.965
Pitch dark and those idlers
still haven't returned.

50:12.040 --> 50:15.931
Claire Fraser, this is Sir Marcus MacRannoch,

50:16.000 --> 50:17.490
a loyal friend to our clan.

50:18.080 --> 50:19.923
This is his home we're sheltering in.

50:20.000 --> 50:21.001
Thank you.

50:21.640 --> 50:23.290
We could use a loyal friend right now.

50:24.280 --> 50:27.204
Tell me, how many men can you muster?

50:27.360 --> 50:30.011
To rescue yer husband
from Wentworth Prison?

50:31.360 --> 50:32.646
Tonight, if possible.

50:33.000 --> 50:34.809
Or tomorrow morning at the very latest.

50:35.480 --> 50:36.481
None.

50:37.240 --> 50:40.323
For it means risking
the Redcoats coming around afterwards

50:40.400 --> 50:43.131
and leveling Eldridge House to the ground.

50:43.680 --> 50:46.365
No lass, I'm sorry.

50:46.720 --> 50:49.326
Temporary shelter I can offer ye,

50:49.440 --> 50:52.649
but I'll not put my family
or myself in jeopardy.

51:00.720 --> 51:01.721
I can pay you.

51:02.200 --> 51:04.567
I wouldn't ask your men
to risk their lives for nothing.

51:04.640 --> 51:06.802
A half dozen or so
would give us a fighting chance.

51:06.880 --> 51:09.087
A dozen would give us
an even better chance.

51:17.760 --> 51:19.683
Where did you get these, woman?

51:21.080 --> 51:23.765
Fraser, you say your name was?

51:24.840 --> 51:25.887
That's right.

51:26.840 --> 51:28.763
My husband gave them to me
on our wedding night.

51:30.240 --> 51:32.322
They're yours, if you'll help us.

51:33.040 --> 51:34.451
Did he indeed?

51:35.000 --> 51:36.001
Ellen's son?

51:37.600 --> 51:40.001
Your husband is Ellen MacKenzie's son?

51:40.760 --> 51:44.651
Aye, and ye'd ken it if you saw him.
He's the spit of her.

51:48.360 --> 51:52.922
I gave these to
Ellen MacKenzie as a wedding gift.

51:55.120 --> 52:00.047
I've thought of them
so often around her bonnie neck.

52:00.600 --> 52:03.490
I wonder if she ever thought
of me while wearing them.

52:05.800 --> 52:08.770
So, they're yours now.

52:09.640 --> 52:11.927
You wear them in good health.

52:14.240 --> 52:16.322
I'd stand a better chance of doing that

52:16.400 --> 52:18.129
if you'd help me get my husband back.

52:18.320 --> 52:19.685
Ah, I see.

52:20.960 --> 52:23.531
But what I cannot see is how it can be done.

52:24.080 --> 52:27.766
I have a wife
and three bairns asleep upstairs.

52:28.640 --> 52:30.642
I must look to their protection. Aye.

52:31.120 --> 52:33.327
I would do a bit for Ellen's lad.

52:34.720 --> 52:36.688
But it's a bit much you ask.

52:47.240 --> 52:48.844
Well, that just leaves the five of us.

52:49.600 --> 52:50.761
It'll have to do.

52:51.040 --> 52:52.690
CLAIRE: I know how to get us inside.

52:52.840 --> 52:55.002
I left the door open at
the rear of the prison.

52:55.080 --> 52:57.401
An open door is nay a plan, lass.

53:00.680 --> 53:01.841
Anyone?

53:10.720 --> 53:14.008
It gives me no pleasure to say such...

53:14.920 --> 53:17.002
Absalom! Man!

53:17.680 --> 53:22.607
I sent you out at daybreak
to bring in 40 head of cattle!

53:22.720 --> 53:24.484
What have you been up to all that time?

53:24.560 --> 53:27.245
Searching! All bloody day!

53:27.800 --> 53:30.849
MACRANNOCH:
Well, ye sure as shite didn't go thirsty.

53:31.280 --> 53:32.850
How many did you bring in?

53:34.880 --> 53:37.611
- ABSALOM: Nineteen.
- MACRANNOCH: Nineteen?

53:38.040 --> 53:40.441
Nineteen out of 40?

53:41.480 --> 53:44.848
What are ye, blind, man?
Is yer nose not working?

53:45.200 --> 53:46.690
Nineteen cattle.

53:46.800 --> 53:48.040
(LAUGHING)

53:48.160 --> 53:49.844
That's no small number.

53:50.480 --> 53:55.202
And what the hell
is so funny about 21 missing cattle?

53:56.160 --> 53:58.606
I know how we can save young Jamie.
