WEBVTT

00:10.010 --> 00:12.012
[engine roaring]

00:13.179 --> 00:15.181
[screeching sounds]

00:15.265 --> 00:17.267
[intense whooshing]

00:21.688 --> 00:23.523
[Niko grunts and gasps]

00:25.191 --> 00:26.568
[grunts]

00:27.861 --> 00:29.029
[groans]

00:29.112 --> 00:30.113
Just hang on.

00:30.196 --> 00:32.032
[intense whooshing]

00:33.700 --> 00:37.579
Here's hoping that
their hyperspeed is faster than our FTL.

00:37.662 --> 00:38.913
[gasps]

00:47.839 --> 00:50.300
[sighs] Okay. Okay.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.386
Please tell me we're there. [sighs]

00:53.470 --> 00:54.763
[Niko groans]

00:54.846 --> 00:55.764
[grunts]

00:58.058 --> 00:59.601
[instruments whirring]

01:04.564 --> 01:07.650
Okay. That's the Artifact.

01:09.444 --> 01:10.361
We made it.

01:12.030 --> 01:12.906
[Niko sighs]

01:13.573 --> 01:14.407
All right.

01:15.575 --> 01:17.410
Now we just have to have faith.

01:17.494 --> 01:21.456
Every planet we've been to so far that
has an Artifact also has organic life,

01:21.539 --> 01:24.292
which means that this planet
should also have oxygen.

01:26.503 --> 01:28.254
What if I took the implant?

01:28.338 --> 01:29.672
I won't let you.

01:29.756 --> 01:31.257
We don't know if, back on Earth,

01:31.341 --> 01:33.551
-Zayn can get that implant out.
-Stop it.

01:34.135 --> 01:37.680
-Stop strategizing how you'll save me.
-I can't.

01:37.764 --> 01:40.141
I can't walk into an Artifact saying,
"I'll take an implant,"

01:40.225 --> 01:42.310
-if I don't intend on keeping it.
-Why not?

01:42.393 --> 01:43.895
Because they'll know.

01:45.438 --> 01:49.234
Richard, when you are in an Artifact,
they are in your head.

01:50.443 --> 01:53.613
I had… coffee with my mom,

01:54.114 --> 01:57.492
and-- and it knew about a silent retreat
that I'd gone on with Erik,

01:57.575 --> 02:00.745
and some damn bird
I tried to save as a child.

02:01.329 --> 02:02.914
So what am I supposed to do?

02:03.623 --> 02:05.708
Stand back and just let you go?

02:07.252 --> 02:08.294
[softly] Richard…

02:11.297 --> 02:13.049
You get me in the Artifact,

02:14.342 --> 02:16.636
-and then you have to let me go.
-No.

02:16.719 --> 02:18.096
-No.
-Richard.

02:18.179 --> 02:19.389
[sighs]

02:21.266 --> 02:22.475
We need to get home.

02:25.436 --> 02:27.230
It is the only way.

02:30.525 --> 02:32.026
[sighs]

02:47.083 --> 02:50.295
Hey. This is Dillon Conner,
Zayn Petrossian,

02:50.795 --> 02:52.046
and Bernie Martinez.

02:52.547 --> 02:54.382
We're the crew of the Salvare.

02:54.465 --> 02:57.677
And we're being hunted by USIC right now
because of--

02:58.261 --> 03:01.264
Amazing how fast USIC can find people

03:01.347 --> 03:03.683
-when they're truly motivated.
-[Mackenzie] "Motivated"?

03:04.976 --> 03:08.104
Do you know how many nutjobs
have been emailing, calling,

03:08.188 --> 03:10.899
storming the security gates
because of your stunt?

03:10.982 --> 03:13.026
-[laughs]
-Uh… Yeah. Duh. I mean…

03:13.109 --> 03:14.986
Shit. That video's got everything.

03:15.069 --> 03:17.989
-Aliens, government conspiracy--
You're sabotaging everything.

03:18.072 --> 03:19.991
Our entire relationship with the Achaia.

03:20.074 --> 03:21.242
Good.

03:21.910 --> 03:22.744
"Good"?

03:22.827 --> 03:24.996
Yeah. We've seen that relationship.

03:25.496 --> 03:27.332
It ends in death and destruction.

03:27.415 --> 03:30.919
Good luck welcoming the aliens
when the whole world's chanting "Go away."

03:31.002 --> 03:33.963
Mm-hm. And that's not the only reason
we made the video.

03:34.047 --> 03:36.549
Seth Gage wiped our memories.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.218
He's killed people.

03:40.553 --> 03:42.680
Where is Erik Wallace? Or Cas Isakovic?

03:42.764 --> 03:44.974
Dead, if we reveal that.

04:15.672 --> 04:17.632
Smart move, struggling with the belt.

04:18.132 --> 04:20.093
I was struggling with the seat belt.

04:20.176 --> 04:21.427
William.

04:23.680 --> 04:24.597
William?

04:39.612 --> 04:40.530
Huh.

04:41.614 --> 04:43.866
I've just never been
in a spaceship before.

04:44.826 --> 04:45.868
Ever?

04:47.745 --> 04:51.207
I mean, Niko was gonna bring me up
before she left and tour me around.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.793
Yeah. We left a bit rushed.

04:58.589 --> 05:01.634
This might be the closest
I've felt to her since she left.

05:03.052 --> 05:04.387
She's here for me too.

05:09.392 --> 05:11.311
So does William just appear or--

05:11.394 --> 05:12.603
He should've by now.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.735
How do you look for someone
who isn't really there?

05:20.153 --> 05:23.281
[Cas, muffled] William! Where are you?
We need to talk to you, now.

05:23.781 --> 05:24.615
[Seth] Any luck?

05:25.116 --> 05:27.660
It's not in his operating system's
virtual memory.

05:27.744 --> 05:29.746
I'm gonna have to do a buffer overrun.

05:30.788 --> 05:32.915
[instruments whirring and bleeping]

05:34.334 --> 05:35.793
Why are you helping him?

05:35.877 --> 05:38.004
[Ursula] I am helping the Achaia.

05:39.005 --> 05:42.383
-They're murderers.
-Humans are murderers.

05:43.301 --> 05:44.719
Everywhere we go.

05:45.303 --> 05:47.055
Romans, Vikings,

05:47.638 --> 05:50.933
European explorers
that decimated entire continents.

05:51.517 --> 05:54.145
-Are we to be conquered, then?
-Liberated.

05:55.021 --> 05:58.566
Elevated to the next phase
of our evolution.

05:58.649 --> 06:03.112
I've seen the restored forests.
I've heard all about the miracle cures.

06:03.613 --> 06:06.199
-They're deceptions. All of them.
-No.

06:07.241 --> 06:08.076
They're not, William.

06:09.243 --> 06:12.872
I used to think
that science could save the world.

06:13.706 --> 06:16.292
I thought that I could save the world.

06:16.376 --> 06:19.212
Look at me, what you did.

06:20.338 --> 06:21.631
You made me.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.050
I'm your creation.

06:25.093 --> 06:29.180
I created Gabriel,
and then I wrote you over top of him.

06:29.764 --> 06:30.640
He's gone.

06:31.724 --> 06:32.683
Deleted.

06:33.434 --> 06:35.561
I helped bring the Salvare home.

06:36.562 --> 06:39.649
I saved the crew multiple times, in fact.

06:43.569 --> 06:45.405
And how many crew did we kill?

06:47.323 --> 06:51.411
Alien viruses,
ejected out of airlocks, burned alive?

06:52.703 --> 06:54.205
I can't save anything, William.

06:55.957 --> 06:57.500
Just let the aliens do it.

06:58.501 --> 07:02.797
That data is the only hope we have
of a defense against the Achaia.

07:02.880 --> 07:04.841
You cannot give it to Seth.

07:05.550 --> 07:06.634
Poor William.

07:07.802 --> 07:09.011
So brave.

07:10.596 --> 07:11.764
So emotional.

07:13.307 --> 07:14.892
This isn't fair to you.

07:15.476 --> 07:16.352
Just stop.

07:17.645 --> 07:18.729
No.

07:18.813 --> 07:19.939
I've located it.

07:22.817 --> 07:23.651
You did?

07:24.485 --> 07:26.821
It's wrapped in a biometric encryption.

07:27.321 --> 07:31.451
I'm gonna have to dig deeper
into his API, but I will crack this.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.462
And then I'll delete you.

07:45.840 --> 07:46.841
Anything?

07:47.383 --> 07:52.972
Some rocks, a big valley,
the Artifact, and then absolutely nothing.

07:54.390 --> 07:55.266
It's weird.

07:56.517 --> 07:57.727
I don't like weird.

07:58.811 --> 08:01.439
Well, if I'm delivering you
to the Artifact,

08:02.356 --> 08:03.733
we can't get captured again.

08:04.358 --> 08:06.068
So, pick.

08:07.361 --> 08:09.197
Where did you find all of this?

08:09.780 --> 08:10.781
[Richard] All over.

08:11.616 --> 08:12.450
Hidden.

08:13.451 --> 08:16.329
If we're goin' out there,
we'll need weapons and armor.

08:17.580 --> 08:19.457
This isn't all Decuma-designed.

08:19.540 --> 08:24.045
Well, whatever species did design it
didn't survive.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.005
-We did.
-[vibrating]

08:26.088 --> 08:27.173
Feel this.

08:27.798 --> 08:28.633
Vibration.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.802
Oh! Sings in your hand. I know.

08:36.557 --> 08:37.892
[puts weapon down]

08:37.975 --> 08:39.268
[vibrations stop]

08:41.354 --> 08:42.438
[grunts]

08:45.441 --> 08:49.153
-You don't wanna pick something lighter?
-Oh, this isn't for fighting!

08:50.947 --> 08:52.323
-[whirring]
-[chuckles[

09:04.835 --> 09:06.504
-Wait here.
-No.

09:07.880 --> 09:08.798
We go together.

09:08.881 --> 09:10.967
No. You're taking the implant.

09:12.009 --> 09:13.386
At least let me go first.

09:17.723 --> 09:19.016
[intense whooshing]

09:19.100 --> 09:20.309
-[Niko coughs]
-[Richard groans]

09:20.393 --> 09:21.769
-Close the door.
-No, no, no.

09:21.852 --> 09:22.937
[both gasping]

09:23.020 --> 09:24.146
The air's fine.

09:24.981 --> 09:27.108
-Just thin. But fine.
-[wheezing]

09:29.318 --> 09:30.820
Breathe in from your gut.

09:32.071 --> 09:33.573
[panting]

09:46.210 --> 09:47.753
[both coughing and gasping]

10:17.950 --> 10:19.076
[sighs]

10:43.142 --> 10:45.144
[debris pattering softly]

10:57.865 --> 10:59.408
[whooshing]

10:59.492 --> 11:01.285
[crashing]

11:03.829 --> 11:04.955
[both gasp]

11:08.292 --> 11:10.294
[whooshing]

11:10.378 --> 11:12.171
[wind whistling]

11:12.922 --> 11:14.465
[inhales wheezily]

11:14.548 --> 11:15.883
[exhales]

11:27.436 --> 11:29.438
[low rumbling]

11:38.823 --> 11:40.282
[Niko] What's that around it?

11:40.366 --> 11:41.200
[soft tinkling]

11:41.283 --> 11:42.451
It's not Achaian?

11:44.829 --> 11:47.164
I've seen three Artifacts up close.

11:48.666 --> 11:53.129
-None of them had any of that.
-Well, let's go find out.

11:55.089 --> 11:57.091
-[intense humming]
-[gentle tinkling]

11:58.217 --> 11:59.593
[Niko gasping]

12:05.725 --> 12:07.059
[sighs] You--

12:07.560 --> 12:08.644
You hear anything?

12:09.145 --> 12:10.020
Yeah.

12:10.771 --> 12:12.148
My heart in my head.

12:13.023 --> 12:15.401
[intense humming
and soft tinkling continue]

12:15.985 --> 12:17.153
[gasps]

12:21.657 --> 12:23.409
Let's see if this lures them out.

12:24.285 --> 12:25.953
[stones clattering]

12:31.834 --> 12:33.794
Okay. Yeah?

12:33.878 --> 12:35.171
-I'm goin' in.
-Okay.

12:39.258 --> 12:40.342
[whirring]

13:04.074 --> 13:05.034
[Richard] Whoa.

13:11.165 --> 13:12.333
What built this?

13:14.543 --> 13:16.045
[Niko] And where did they go?

13:22.843 --> 13:23.677
[Richard] Niko.

13:30.518 --> 13:35.272
[Niko] This is a record
of when the Achaia landed on this planet.

13:35.856 --> 13:37.358
And whatever was here

13:38.567 --> 13:39.568
welcomed them.

13:51.705 --> 13:52.581
Richard.

13:53.249 --> 13:55.251
-What?
-Below you.

14:17.189 --> 14:18.315
[gasps]

14:33.330 --> 14:35.833
These columns are headstones.

14:41.422 --> 14:42.923
This is a cemetery.

14:44.800 --> 14:47.511
These are what? Kings and queens?

14:49.138 --> 14:51.765
[Richard] They even
have Achaian implants as crowns.

14:55.185 --> 14:56.979
I saw implants on Zakir.

14:57.062 --> 15:01.442
It was… carnage.
There were bodies everywhere. This is…

15:05.321 --> 15:06.739
this is ceremonial.

15:08.782 --> 15:11.118
Oh, but still a bunch of dead aliens.

15:12.703 --> 15:14.496
[low humming]

15:14.580 --> 15:15.664
[grinding]

15:20.753 --> 15:22.755
-[gentle tinkling]
-[low, pulsating hum]

15:26.508 --> 15:28.052
Whoa! Hey, hey. What are you doin'?

15:30.012 --> 15:31.555
What we came here to do.

15:34.141 --> 15:35.017
Surrendering.

15:53.452 --> 15:55.454
[tinkling and humming continue]

16:02.795 --> 16:03.754
[echoing] Do me a favor.

16:05.381 --> 16:07.341
[echoing] Yeah. Anything.

16:08.509 --> 16:10.052
When we get back to Earth…

16:12.638 --> 16:14.056
don't let me see Erik.

16:17.351 --> 16:19.144
Really. Don't let me see Jana.

16:21.855 --> 16:26.276
I won't… be myself as long as I have
one of those things in my head, and…

16:28.112 --> 16:31.615
the self that I will be,
I don't trust with my family.

16:35.411 --> 16:36.245
Okay.

16:41.291 --> 16:42.292
[sighs]

16:50.801 --> 16:52.803
[high-pitched ringing]

16:54.638 --> 16:56.098
[groaning]

16:59.393 --> 17:00.769
It's too much. [gasps]

17:00.853 --> 17:02.813
Stop, stop, stop. All at once.

17:03.939 --> 17:05.357
[ringing subsides]

17:10.571 --> 17:12.031
We know where Niko is.

17:13.073 --> 17:13.991
Breckinridge?

17:14.074 --> 17:17.995
She's in an Artifact with Richard Ncube
on a planet orbiting a star named Citalá.

17:18.078 --> 17:22.332
And she'll be replacing me
if I can't extract William's fucking data!

17:22.416 --> 17:23.751
I need more time.

17:23.834 --> 17:27.046
If I had my quantum annealers,
I could brute force the--

17:27.129 --> 17:28.839
What if I decrypted the data for you?

17:29.423 --> 17:30.382
I wouldn't trust it.

17:30.466 --> 17:32.718
What if the exchange
was mutually beneficial?

17:33.343 --> 17:34.470
What if?

17:34.553 --> 17:38.974
Twenty minutes ago, Cas Isakovic
brought Erik Wallace on board the Salvare.

17:39.558 --> 17:40.392
And?

17:43.979 --> 17:45.689
Niko means the world to me.

17:46.190 --> 17:47.066
You love her?

17:47.566 --> 17:50.110
Yeah. I'd like to spend
the rest of her life together,

17:50.611 --> 17:52.362
but not-- not as myself.

17:52.946 --> 17:56.116
If I could place my codin'
into an Achaian implant,

17:56.200 --> 18:00.954
could that implant be placed
inside Erik Wallace?

18:04.083 --> 18:05.167
It might not work.

18:05.250 --> 18:07.669
For an implant to take long-term,
it's better if it's accepted,

18:07.753 --> 18:10.297
-and Erik would never do that.
-What if we gave him no choice?

18:10.881 --> 18:12.591
[Ursula] This is disgusting.

18:13.217 --> 18:16.136
This is grotesque, even considering it!

18:17.304 --> 18:21.934
I won't have anything to do with this.
I-- I want to leave right now.

18:22.017 --> 18:25.771
You'll shut up, or you'll join those
dead astronauts you're so torn up about.

18:26.355 --> 18:27.731
Shall I bring Erik to you?

18:28.732 --> 18:29.566
Do it.

18:30.901 --> 18:31.819
We'll be ready.

18:39.159 --> 18:42.162
I can see William online,
but I can't access his processing core.

18:42.246 --> 18:43.789
-[William appears]
-She's found it.

18:43.872 --> 18:44.790
[Cas] William.

18:45.290 --> 18:47.251
-Wait. Who's found it?
-Ursula Monroe.

18:47.334 --> 18:49.920
-She's here?
-With Seth Gage in the med lab.

18:50.003 --> 18:51.839
She's located the data.

18:51.922 --> 18:55.008
It's encrypted, but she wrote my coding.
It's only a matter of time before--

18:55.092 --> 18:56.093
-[whirring]
-Oh, no.

18:56.176 --> 18:57.136
[breaking up] No!

18:59.263 --> 19:00.931
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

19:01.014 --> 19:03.016
If-- if Seth's here,
he's with USIC security.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.227
They've got those implants.

19:07.062 --> 19:07.896
Follow me.

19:08.772 --> 19:09.648
Cas?

19:16.864 --> 19:18.949
I'm Cas Isakovic,
commander of the Salvare.

19:19.032 --> 19:21.368
-I'm looking for Seth Gage.
-Erik. Ahem.

19:21.952 --> 19:23.704
Uh, Cas, there's more.

19:25.539 --> 19:26.957
Officer, stand dow-- Whoa!

19:29.960 --> 19:31.211
[officer grunting]

19:31.295 --> 19:32.671
Yaah! Gah!

19:36.383 --> 19:38.218
-[moans]
-Whoa!

19:40.179 --> 19:41.513
[yells] Cas!

19:52.858 --> 19:54.943
[Erik] Okay. Okay, okay. Okay.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.904
Okay! [grumbles]

19:59.281 --> 20:02.201
Fuck me. If it isn't
the Achaian employee of the month.

20:02.284 --> 20:03.702
Surprised to see you, Erik.

20:03.785 --> 20:06.288
And you, helping them.

20:06.371 --> 20:07.748
-Restrain him.
-On the bed.

20:07.831 --> 20:10.542
-I-- Hey, hey, hey. Get your hands off.
-Now! Let's go. Let's go!

20:11.543 --> 20:14.588
-Okay.
-Hey. None of this is necessary.

20:14.671 --> 20:16.632
I've almost hacked into
William's encryption.

20:16.715 --> 20:19.176
-Just give me more time.
-We need you to take an implant.

20:19.259 --> 20:20.469
No! Never!

20:22.054 --> 20:23.180
Get the f--

20:25.891 --> 20:27.226
He's all yours, William.

20:28.393 --> 20:29.645
Niko's alive.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.194
Where is she? I mean, how-- how is she?

20:37.861 --> 20:38.820
[William] She's safe.

20:39.655 --> 20:43.367
She's in an Artifact
on a planet we're yet to travel to.

20:44.368 --> 20:46.161
Great. How are we gettin' her home?

20:46.245 --> 20:48.664
[Seth] Well, we are going to open a bridge

20:49.331 --> 20:51.917
between that Artifact and here.

20:52.876 --> 20:56.129
And all you need is for me
to take a spider.

20:56.630 --> 20:59.216
Accept an implant into your consciousness.

20:59.800 --> 21:00.634
Like I did.

21:01.218 --> 21:03.720
Do I get to become a raging asshole too?

21:03.804 --> 21:05.806
[laughs] Uh…

21:07.057 --> 21:08.475
Worse. You become William.

21:11.853 --> 21:13.689
Niko trusted you.

21:15.524 --> 21:18.193
You gave them the data, didn't you?

21:19.236 --> 21:20.362
No. Not yet.

21:20.445 --> 21:23.115
Tell you what. Erik, I got an idea.

21:23.782 --> 21:25.158
I'll call up Jana.

21:25.242 --> 21:27.869
I'll ask her how she feels
about becoming an orphan.

21:27.953 --> 21:28.787
No.

21:29.955 --> 21:31.498
No, no, no.

21:32.082 --> 21:33.542
Don't-- don't-- don't call.

21:34.501 --> 21:35.752
[whimpers]

21:37.337 --> 21:38.588
[sighs]

21:40.132 --> 21:40.966
Do it.

21:50.600 --> 21:51.893
[Ursula screams]

21:52.602 --> 21:54.104
Why did you shoot him?

21:54.187 --> 21:57.149
Ursula,
William is going to decrypt that data.

21:57.232 --> 21:59.735
-Once I confirm it's what I'm looking for…
-Uh-huh?

21:59.818 --> 22:01.945
…I want you to be ready to press delete.

22:02.029 --> 22:04.781
Wait. Wait! I don't think he's dead.

22:06.199 --> 22:08.201
[crunching]

22:11.580 --> 22:12.998
[whirring]

22:13.081 --> 22:15.083
[screeching]

22:15.876 --> 22:16.918
[screams] No!

22:17.002 --> 22:18.712
[spider whirring]

22:21.590 --> 22:23.592
[screeching]

22:32.976 --> 22:34.019
Oh, fuck.

22:35.020 --> 22:37.981
Quick. Jump in before he changes his mind.

22:38.065 --> 22:39.066
No, no, no, no.

22:39.149 --> 22:40.442
[hyperventilating]

22:43.403 --> 22:46.490
Not until the bridge is open
and Niko and Richard are safe.

22:47.282 --> 22:49.618
When I get what I want,
you'll get what you want.

22:49.701 --> 22:51.370
So go over there and make it happen.

22:51.453 --> 22:52.412
Sure.

22:59.961 --> 23:01.963
[rumbling]

23:14.226 --> 23:15.060
[Niko] Hello?

23:19.940 --> 23:21.900
Thank you for letting us in.

23:21.983 --> 23:24.111
[Niko's voice echoing] …for letting us in…

23:25.112 --> 23:26.488
I'm ready to negotiate now.

23:30.826 --> 23:31.952
[Richard] Who's that?

23:32.702 --> 23:34.413
Maybe someone from your past?

23:37.040 --> 23:40.252
Seth Gage,
Department of Homeland Security.

23:40.335 --> 23:41.420
I'm here to rescue you.

23:43.505 --> 23:44.881
You took the implant?

23:46.133 --> 23:47.926
Only after you turned it down.

23:48.552 --> 23:50.095
So you're their spokesman?

23:51.888 --> 23:52.722
I am.

23:55.267 --> 23:56.810
Oh, that means I can do this.

23:56.893 --> 23:58.728
[rumbling]

24:01.481 --> 24:02.399
Earth.

24:03.275 --> 24:05.277
[gentle rainfall]

24:09.489 --> 24:10.490
It's raining.

24:11.324 --> 24:13.368
Not a whole lot I can do about that.

24:13.452 --> 24:14.453
No, I'm…

24:15.954 --> 24:17.372
I'm not complaining.

24:19.791 --> 24:20.625
So…

24:21.710 --> 24:24.921
we can just… walk on through?

24:30.969 --> 24:33.889
Cas, Seth's opened the bridge to Earth.
I need you, fast as possible.

24:37.559 --> 24:39.519
Apologies for the machinations, Erik,

24:39.603 --> 24:42.647
but I've discovered the only thing
the Achaia respond to is cruelty.

24:43.064 --> 24:44.649
What do you want me to do, William?

24:44.733 --> 24:47.360
Distract him
while I do the same on the other end.

24:47.444 --> 24:49.779
-I need him weak and preoccupied.
-You don't wanna kill him?

24:49.863 --> 24:52.407
[William] Not till we know
Niko and Richard are safe.

24:52.491 --> 24:54.868
And we may still need Seth,
even after that.

24:54.951 --> 24:55.785
But hurt him.

24:55.869 --> 24:57.704
Painfully, repeatedly.

24:58.371 --> 24:59.206
William.

24:59.706 --> 25:00.832
I wanna help.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.542
They'll be attacking my coding.

25:02.626 --> 25:04.044
Trying to delete me.

25:04.127 --> 25:06.338
I'll buttress it. Keep you safe.

25:08.131 --> 25:10.133
[intense whirring]

25:17.557 --> 25:18.892
[Cas grunts]

25:27.400 --> 25:28.652
Fucking William.

25:29.236 --> 25:30.445
What about William?

25:31.321 --> 25:32.155
He's here?

25:32.906 --> 25:34.699
[grunts]

25:34.783 --> 25:37.077
No! Let him go!

25:37.994 --> 25:39.913
[choking]

25:40.747 --> 25:42.165
[groaning]

25:42.249 --> 25:44.417
What the fuck
are you doing to me back there?

25:44.501 --> 25:45.710
[gasping]

25:45.794 --> 25:47.879
-[choking]
-[Seth] Hurts, doesn't it?

25:47.963 --> 25:50.340
-Didn't think you could feel pain in here.
-[Niko] Let him go!

25:50.423 --> 25:54.135
When Iara encountered the Achaia,
they strangled her.

25:54.219 --> 25:55.303
But she wasn't ready.

25:56.680 --> 25:57.764
I am.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.188
-Run.
-[Niko] William?

26:06.565 --> 26:08.692
William, can you get back?

26:11.152 --> 26:12.487
[groans]

26:12.571 --> 26:14.197
I'm certainly gonna try.

26:14.281 --> 26:15.865
-We need to go. We need to go!
-[yelps]

26:20.954 --> 26:22.330
[gasping]

26:22.414 --> 26:23.665
[grinding]

26:23.748 --> 26:25.834
-Oh!
-[laughs]

26:28.128 --> 26:30.005
-We made it.
-We did.

26:30.088 --> 26:30.964
We're home!

26:31.798 --> 26:33.008
[both laugh]

26:33.091 --> 26:34.759
We made it. We're-- [laughs]

26:35.719 --> 26:36.553
We made it.

26:40.265 --> 26:43.560
"A robot may not injure a human."

26:44.603 --> 26:45.812
Well, I'm not a robot,

26:46.313 --> 26:48.523
-and in here…
-[spluttering]

26:48.607 --> 26:51.192
…you're not a human being.

26:51.276 --> 26:52.444
[yells]

26:58.199 --> 26:59.618
What's going on? Where's William?

27:00.744 --> 27:02.078
He's still in the implant.

27:02.954 --> 27:04.831
Get William out of that thing!

27:04.914 --> 27:06.958
[Ursula] I'm trying to,
but his code is under attack!

27:09.252 --> 27:12.464
Every time I think
I've corralled his code, it resets.

27:14.883 --> 27:18.261
Seth, no. Seth.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

27:18.345 --> 27:20.096
[screeches]

27:20.180 --> 27:22.265
[spider's power dying]

27:24.726 --> 27:25.769
Fucking William.

27:26.645 --> 27:29.064
-[William appears]
-Perhaps I was too fast for you.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.068
I'm afraid you can't hurt me here.

27:34.110 --> 27:35.820
-[yells]
-[grunts]

27:42.577 --> 27:44.829
[Seth] You can kill me. It doesn't matter.

27:45.872 --> 27:47.832
Word's out. The Achaians are pissed.

27:49.084 --> 27:51.836
Rings are gathering. They'll be here--

27:51.920 --> 27:53.421
[gasping for breath]

27:54.631 --> 27:55.840
[groans]

27:57.300 --> 27:58.134
Ursula.

28:00.178 --> 28:03.431
[Niko] William? Cas? Answer me.

28:04.808 --> 28:07.352
[Erik] Oh, my God!

28:07.435 --> 28:08.561
Niko!

28:09.145 --> 28:10.689
-Erik?
-[laughs]

28:10.772 --> 28:14.359
-Did Richard make it?
-Yeah, he did. Can't believe it.

28:15.151 --> 28:16.486
What about William?

28:16.569 --> 28:18.113
Glad to see we're all here.

28:19.364 --> 28:20.699
Thank you, William.

28:21.658 --> 28:23.243
Ah, it's all in a day's work.

28:23.910 --> 28:27.914
Hey. I'm gonna head up there.
Reintroduce ourselves.

28:27.997 --> 28:30.542
-Uh, give me a sec.
-[Erik] There's so much to tell you.

28:30.625 --> 28:33.420
But you actually need
to talk to Cas and William

28:33.503 --> 28:36.005
because Seth said
that the Achaia are on their way.

28:36.089 --> 28:36.923
[Niko] What?

28:37.006 --> 28:39.676
Please tell me
the neutrino weapon is up and running.

28:39.759 --> 28:43.596
I've been workin' on it,
and, um… I've been strugglin'.

28:43.680 --> 28:47.183
If the Achaia really are pissed,
we're gonna need some kind of defense.

28:47.267 --> 28:49.477
[radio chatter]

28:49.561 --> 28:51.813
I gotta go. I've got USIC incoming.

28:52.397 --> 28:53.356
I love you.

28:53.440 --> 28:54.983
I love you too.

28:55.066 --> 28:56.693
I'll see you back on Earth.

28:58.361 --> 28:59.446
Commander Breckinridge?

28:59.529 --> 29:01.072
Is that really necessary?

29:01.156 --> 29:03.408
Annette Mackenzie, Secretary of State.

29:04.075 --> 29:04.909
Welcome back.

29:06.369 --> 29:09.247
And, yes, we cuff everyone
stepping out of the Artifact.

29:10.540 --> 29:11.750
Are you still human?

29:13.042 --> 29:13.960
No implant?

29:15.628 --> 29:17.130
Yes. Why?

29:19.215 --> 29:20.842
Then let's hurry up and do this.

29:21.342 --> 29:23.344
-We need to get the military ready.
-For?

29:23.845 --> 29:25.764
When the Achaia attack.

29:27.432 --> 29:29.058
Come on. [grunts]

29:29.934 --> 29:33.271
[Erik] So you're telling me
that neutrinos did that level of damage?

29:33.354 --> 29:36.733
Yes. High-density neutrinos.
Blasted from a magnetar.

29:37.233 --> 29:39.444
Oh, it destroyed the entire ring.

29:39.944 --> 29:41.946
I mean,
if only we had a neutron star nearby.

29:42.030 --> 29:44.240
-We have a particle accelerator.
-It can do that?

29:44.324 --> 29:45.700
In its current state? No.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.535
Is there a future state
you're thinking of?

29:47.619 --> 29:49.120
That's where I'm stumped.

29:49.204 --> 29:53.208
We need more neutrinos,
but any attempt at increasin' production

29:53.291 --> 29:56.377
leads to an overheatin' of
the superconductin' magnetic confinement.

29:56.461 --> 29:58.963
X-rays, gamma rays, hadrons, electrons.

29:59.047 --> 30:02.592
Basically, everythin' starts shootin'
holes in the ship, then it explodes.

30:02.675 --> 30:05.637
What if we backed off
on the accelerator beam,

30:05.720 --> 30:09.641
directed equal power
into the cooling systems,

30:09.724 --> 30:12.101
and then toggle between the two?

30:13.812 --> 30:15.146
Shall we run the theory?

30:15.230 --> 30:16.064
Yeah.

30:18.441 --> 30:20.443
-[rainfall]
-[radio chatter]

30:21.986 --> 30:24.614
No offense, but this'll go faster
if I speak to the Joint Chiefs.

30:24.697 --> 30:27.534
-I've been trying to find Seth Gage.
-Seth went rogue.

30:27.617 --> 30:28.743
Why would he do that?

30:28.827 --> 30:31.871
Probably for the same reason
we're expecting the Achaia to attack.

30:32.372 --> 30:34.290
-We know what kills them.
-You wanna kill them?

30:34.374 --> 30:37.627
We wanna be prepared
in case they arrive intending to kill us.

30:37.710 --> 30:40.672
-We're trying to forge an understand--
-I'll speak to the Joint Chiefs now.

30:42.882 --> 30:44.551
[radio chatter]

30:52.058 --> 30:53.351
How's it goin', Erik?

30:54.269 --> 30:55.353
[Erik] Amazing.

30:55.979 --> 30:59.566
William's modulated
the accelerator and the cooling systems.

30:59.649 --> 31:01.818
The magnetic confinements are holding.

31:01.901 --> 31:04.904
We've got a neutrino flux of…
ten trillion.

31:04.988 --> 31:07.115
I'd say we triple that
in another 20 minutes.

31:07.198 --> 31:09.075
This ship is now a neutrino bomb.

31:09.659 --> 31:12.203
No, no. Bomb gives us one shot.

31:12.287 --> 31:14.497
Bomb leaves Earth defenseless.

31:14.998 --> 31:18.042
Yes, yes, yes.
But if I destroy a cluster of ships,

31:18.126 --> 31:21.754
bomb gives Ursula time to release the data
to the rest of the world.

31:21.838 --> 31:24.299
Countries can then make their own bombs.

31:24.382 --> 31:26.217
William, bomb is not happening.

31:26.301 --> 31:27.427
[inhales shakily]

31:28.136 --> 31:29.971
I'm not sure it has to.

31:30.638 --> 31:34.893
When the magnetar dusted the Achaian ship,
you were towing it, right?

31:34.976 --> 31:36.102
That's correct.

31:36.603 --> 31:37.478
How?

31:37.979 --> 31:41.900
Manipulated gravity released into space,
focused using the FTL drive.

31:41.983 --> 31:45.486
Okay.
So, do the same thing with the neutrinos.

31:45.570 --> 31:47.280
They possess equal properties.

31:47.363 --> 31:48.406
Or better.

31:50.116 --> 31:53.411
I could tweak the FTL bubble
and give the neutrinos aim.

31:53.494 --> 31:55.288
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Make the bomb a gun?

31:56.497 --> 31:57.498
It's a big fucking gun.

31:58.082 --> 32:00.585
-I like this, William.
-[William] There's one problem, though.

32:00.668 --> 32:04.297
USIC engineers have already started
dismantlin' the FTL drive.

32:04.380 --> 32:07.342
-I'll reconnect it.
-I'll help. Uh, what do I do?

32:07.425 --> 32:09.636
Are either of you two claustrophobic?

32:17.393 --> 32:19.729
Did they take a lawn mower to this?

32:20.229 --> 32:22.815
Completely slashed the circuitry
to the FTL drive.

32:22.899 --> 32:24.275
Can you fix it?

32:24.359 --> 32:25.526
Yes.

32:25.610 --> 32:27.487
We just have to undo some of the damage.

32:27.570 --> 32:28.988
How long's it gonna take?

32:29.072 --> 32:29.906
-Uh…
-[tool whirs]

32:30.949 --> 32:33.785
Everything still needs to be placed
on the circuit path from the bridge.

32:33.868 --> 32:35.954
But then after that, uh, that's it.

32:36.037 --> 32:38.247
William should have access
to the FTL drive again.

32:38.331 --> 32:39.832
[alarm blares]

32:39.916 --> 32:41.000
[tool whirs]

32:41.751 --> 32:42.835
What is happening?

32:43.544 --> 32:45.505
A wormhole's opening
between Earth and Mars.

32:47.924 --> 32:49.050
Is anything coming through?

32:50.510 --> 32:52.637
-[bleeping]
-At least one Achaian ring.

32:52.720 --> 32:54.472
How long is it gonna take?

32:55.223 --> 32:56.057
[Niko] Salvare?

32:57.100 --> 32:57.934
Salvare?

32:59.894 --> 33:02.105
Cas? Erik?

33:02.689 --> 33:04.190
[tools whirring]

33:04.273 --> 33:05.775
[alarm blaring]

33:07.694 --> 33:09.112
[bleeping]

33:11.572 --> 33:14.283
What if we nuke them?
Fire up every missile?

33:14.367 --> 33:16.828
-Delay the attack on Earth.
-The Joint Chiefs would say no.

33:19.038 --> 33:21.165
Niko? Oh, thank God you're back.

33:21.749 --> 33:23.543
And we brought the Achaia with us.

33:24.043 --> 33:25.670
Shit. How many ships?

33:25.753 --> 33:28.089
One. It is enough.

33:28.673 --> 33:30.091
Are you sure Earth's the target?

33:31.259 --> 33:32.260
Uh--

33:32.343 --> 33:33.720
[alarm blaring]

33:34.595 --> 33:36.264
[bleeping speeding up]

33:41.561 --> 33:44.230
[Cas] The ring's closing in!
I need that weapon now!

33:44.313 --> 33:46.149
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

33:46.232 --> 33:47.775
[tool whirring]

33:48.276 --> 33:49.360
[Niko] Salvare?

33:49.444 --> 33:51.446
[alarm continues blaring]

33:51.529 --> 33:53.031
Come on. Answer me!

33:54.907 --> 33:57.452
William? Erik?

33:58.369 --> 33:59.996
