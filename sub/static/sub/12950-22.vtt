00:03.692 --> 00:06.192
<i>My name is Sydney Bristow.</i>

00:06.194 --> 00:07.795
<i>Seven years ago,
I was recruited</i>

00:07.796 --> 00:10.765
<i>by a secret branch of the CIA
called SD-6.</i>

00:10.865 --> 00:12.733
<i>I was sworn to secrecy,</i>

00:12.734 --> 00:14.568
<i>but I couldn't keep it
from my fianc√©,</i>

00:14.568 --> 00:16.971
<i>and when the head of SD-6
found out,</i>

00:16.972 --> 00:19.472
<i>he had him killed.</i>

00:19.608 --> 00:21.041
<i>That's when I learned
the truth.</i>

00:21.042 --> 00:23.143
<i>SD-6 is not part of the CIA.</i>

00:23.144 --> 00:25.045
<i>I'd been working
for the very people</i>

00:25.046 --> 00:26.947
<i>I thought
I was fighting against.</i>

00:26.948 --> 00:28.315
<i>So I went to the only place</i>

00:28.316 --> 00:30.217
<i>that could help me
take them down.</i>

00:30.218 --> 00:31.952
<i>Now I'm a double agent
for the CIA,</i>

00:31.953 --> 00:35.411
<i>where my handler
is a man named Michael Vaughn.</i>

00:36.758 --> 00:39.193
<i>Only one other person knows
the truth about what I do.</i>

00:39.194 --> 00:41.890
<i>Another double agent
inside SD-6.</i>

00:41.997 --> 00:44.497
<i>Someone I hardly know.</i>

00:44.566 --> 00:47.066
<i>My father.</i>

00:47.702 --> 00:50.137
It's Emily.
She knows about SD-6.

00:50.138 --> 00:52.506
I know.
It's too late.

00:52.507 --> 00:54.475
Your conversation was recorded.

00:54.476 --> 00:56.944
Sloane won't let them
kill Emily.

00:56.945 --> 00:58.579
The final decision
will not be made

00:58.580 --> 01:01.743
until after Sloane has met with
the head of Alliance security.

01:05.352 --> 01:06.387
Aah!

01:06.388 --> 01:07.621
You're not bringing him
into this life.

01:07.622 --> 01:10.853
He is in this life now,
whether you like it or not.

01:12.560 --> 01:14.228
You'll be safe here.

01:14.229 --> 01:15.529
I promise.

01:15.530 --> 01:16.897
If you need anything,

01:16.898 --> 01:20.231
there are agents
watching behind the mirror.

01:22.537 --> 01:24.872
Guys, is there a food situation?

01:24.873 --> 01:27.535
Is there any chance
I could get something to eat?

01:27.609 --> 01:29.943
Like a burger or something?
I'm easy.

01:31.246 --> 01:34.181
Oh, yeah.
30 minutes or less.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:30.638 --> 02:34.404
My employer has instructed me
to keep you alive...

02:34.476 --> 02:36.976
but not comfortable.

02:37.545 --> 02:40.045
So I'll ask you once.

02:40.749 --> 02:44.549
What is The Circumference,
and how do you know about it?

02:44.619 --> 02:45.886
Listen to me, man.

02:45.887 --> 02:49.186
There has been
a major misunderstanding here.

02:49.257 --> 02:52.715
I don't know
what The Circumference is.

02:52.827 --> 02:55.327
Do you understand me?

02:56.231 --> 02:58.731
I don't know.

03:57.225 --> 03:59.725
Hello.

04:03.498 --> 04:05.699
- I'm opening the restaurant.
- What?

04:05.700 --> 04:09.295
I have to open the restaurant.
I just decided.

04:09.370 --> 04:11.895
I feel like I've been waiting
for my life to start.

04:11.973 --> 04:13.974
My ass is on that couch
12 hours a day.

04:13.975 --> 04:15.943
You're about to
graduate from business school.

04:15.944 --> 04:17.911
But then what?
I didn't have a plan.

04:17.911 --> 04:20.346
Here's a plan.

04:20.348 --> 04:22.848
- Do you already have a place?
- Yeah, it's in Silver Lake.

04:22.917 --> 04:25.319
I'm not even sure
what it's gonna be yet.

04:32.760 --> 04:33.994
Hello?

04:33.995 --> 04:36.495
Sydney Bristow.

04:38.299 --> 04:40.400
Yes.

04:40.401 --> 04:43.370
I'm calling on this line
because I know it's untraceable.

04:43.438 --> 04:45.272
Listen to me very carefully.

04:45.273 --> 04:49.972
We have your friend,
and we plan to kill him,

04:50.044 --> 04:52.145
unless you do the following.

04:52.146 --> 04:53.981
There's a document
recently stolen

04:53.982 --> 04:55.716
from a nightclub in Paris.

04:55.717 --> 04:57.284
It belongs to my employer.

04:57.285 --> 05:00.686
Though it appears to be a blank
page, it has great value to him.

05:00.755 --> 05:03.023
And he wants it back.

05:03.024 --> 05:05.192
Along with a certain
container of liquid.

05:05.193 --> 05:06.727
I believe you are familiar

05:06.728 --> 05:09.856
with the items
to which I am referring.

05:09.964 --> 05:11.598
Yes, I am.

05:11.599 --> 05:15.433
Syd, don't listen to him!
Don't do anything for me!

05:15.503 --> 05:17.037
You have 48 hours.

05:17.038 --> 05:20.007
There's an alleyway in Taipei
at Ho Ping and Ruian.

05:20.074 --> 05:22.599
Be there Tuesday at midnight.

05:24.212 --> 05:26.246
The CIA has
the page Khasinau wants.

05:26.247 --> 05:27.481
SD-6 has the ampule.

05:27.482 --> 05:29.950
You and I
could just turn them over.

05:29.951 --> 05:32.386
We cannot afford
to blindly hand the enemy

05:32.387 --> 05:34.354
something he wants
so desperately.

05:34.355 --> 05:36.855
I don't know
that much about you.

05:37.792 --> 05:40.454
Do you have any close friends?

05:40.562 --> 05:42.829
I mean, people that you love?

05:42.830 --> 05:44.765
I don't need
a lecture on friendship

05:44.766 --> 05:46.700
to understand
what's at stake here.

05:46.701 --> 05:50.501
And while I might look
at scenarios more strategically,

05:50.572 --> 05:53.735
you could learn something
from my experience.

05:54.509 --> 05:56.443
The Rambaldi document
Khasinau wants.

05:56.444 --> 05:58.745
He can't make the ink
on that page visible

05:58.746 --> 06:00.948
without the ampule.

06:00.949 --> 06:03.611
Reading that page
is so important to Khasinau

06:03.685 --> 06:07.314
that he risked sending a team
into SD-6 to try and steal it.

06:08.623 --> 06:10.891
You want to get the page
and the ampule

06:10.892 --> 06:13.160
and see for ourselves
what that page is.

06:13.161 --> 06:15.095
We can't strategize
our next move

06:15.096 --> 06:16.763
without that information.

06:16.764 --> 06:19.264
Getting the ampule
from the CIA storage facility

06:19.334 --> 06:20.901
should be straightforward.

06:20.902 --> 06:23.402
It's recovering the page
I'm concerned about.

06:23.471 --> 06:26.031
It was moved to the SD-6
off-site lab.

06:26.107 --> 06:29.167
The lab is on
a former military site.

06:29.243 --> 06:30.877
It's surrounded by water.

06:30.878 --> 06:33.080
We'll get in
through the drainage system,

06:33.081 --> 06:36.847
and access requires Sloane's
voice I.D. And fingerprints.

06:40.622 --> 06:41.655
It's Vaughn.

06:41.656 --> 06:43.023
Khasinau knew about
the safe house.

06:43.024 --> 06:45.058
He must have someone
on the inside.

06:45.059 --> 06:47.160
As long as there's
a mole at the CIA...

06:47.161 --> 06:49.096
you can't tell Vaughn a thing.

06:49.097 --> 06:52.464
Not that you've been contacted
or that you and I have spoken.

06:52.533 --> 06:55.195
Sydney,
I'm so sorry about this.

06:56.204 --> 06:58.505
But there's no reason
to assume the worst.

06:58.506 --> 07:00.974
They used tranquilizers
on the security team,

07:00.975 --> 07:03.243
which means
they weren't out for blood.

07:03.244 --> 07:09.376
If this is a kidnapping,
they'll contact us.

07:10.485 --> 07:13.045
I'm just so scared for him.

07:16.924 --> 07:19.859
You'll contact me
if you hear anything.

07:23.931 --> 07:26.431
Vaughn.

07:27.235 --> 07:29.735
What's going on?

07:31.272 --> 07:33.772
What do you mean?

07:34.942 --> 07:36.743
I haven't known Sydney
that long,

07:36.744 --> 07:38.812
but I feel like I know her
well enough to know

07:38.813 --> 07:41.543
that she doesn't just
accept problems.

07:41.616 --> 07:43.884
Do you think she'll try
and get her friend back?

07:43.885 --> 07:46.153
- Maybe.
- Why wouldn't she tell you?

07:46.154 --> 07:50.147
She doesn't exactly trust
the CIA right now. Would you?

07:51.659 --> 07:54.159
Trust is a tricky thing.

07:55.897 --> 07:57.230
What does that mean?

07:57.231 --> 08:00.689
I think you need
to fill Devlin in about Sydney.

08:00.802 --> 08:03.396
Not a chance.
What? Fill him in on conjecture?

08:03.471 --> 08:05.138
I know this
is a difficult time.

08:05.139 --> 08:07.374
Do not let
your concern for Sydney

08:07.375 --> 08:09.109
get ahead of your responsibility
to the Agency.

08:09.110 --> 08:10.844
That is not
what I'm doing here!

08:10.845 --> 08:13.013
Hey, my investigation's
on a schedule.

08:13.014 --> 08:15.148
You have an appointment.
You're late.

08:15.149 --> 08:16.450
I didn't think you'd mind.

08:16.451 --> 08:18.951
Hey, guess what?
I do.

08:29.464 --> 08:31.989
Arvin, this is beautiful.

08:32.100 --> 08:33.433
What did you do?

08:33.433 --> 08:35.869
Did you rent this place
for me to recover in?

08:35.870 --> 08:38.370
Sit down.

08:40.041 --> 08:43.101
You've been quiet
since we left the hospital.

08:44.545 --> 08:46.546
Arvin, you're scaring me.

08:46.547 --> 08:48.315
<i># Look at my hands #</i>

08:48.316 --> 08:53.845
<i># There's so much here
that I don't understand #</i>

08:53.921 --> 08:58.517
<i># Your face-saving promises
whispered like prayers #</i>

08:58.626 --> 09:00.727
<i># I don't need them #</i>

09:00.728 --> 09:03.663
SD-6 is not part
of the CIA.

09:03.765 --> 09:07.257
<i># 'Cause I've been
treated so wrong #</i>

09:07.368 --> 09:10.633
<i># I've been treated so long #</i>

09:10.705 --> 09:15.438
<i># As if I'm becoming
untouchable #</i>

09:15.510 --> 09:18.502
<i># Well, contempt
loves the silence #</i>

09:18.579 --> 09:21.412
<i># It thrives in the dark #</i>

09:21.482 --> 09:27.443
<i># With fine winding tendrils
that strangle the heart #</i>

09:27.522 --> 09:32.425
<i># They say that promises
sweeten the blow #</i>

09:32.527 --> 09:34.861
<i># But I don't need them #</i>

09:34.862 --> 09:37.695
<i># No, I don't need them #</i>

09:37.765 --> 09:40.700
<i># I've been treated so wrong #</i>

09:40.768 --> 09:44.135
<i># I've been treated so long #</i>

09:44.205 --> 09:48.801
<i># As if I'm becoming
untouchable #</i>

09:48.876 --> 09:55.076
<i># I'm a slow-dying flower
in the frost-killing hour #</i>

09:55.149 --> 10:00.610
<i># Sweet turning sour
and untouchable #</i>

10:17.071 --> 10:19.801
This shirt is made
of heat-sensitive material.

10:19.874 --> 10:22.175
Get Sloane to touch it.

10:22.176 --> 10:24.277
It'll transmit a copy
of his prints,

10:24.278 --> 10:26.146
and I'll create
a latex duplicate.

10:26.147 --> 10:28.048
This is a wireless relay.

10:28.049 --> 10:31.109
It'll log me into Sloane's
computer once you're in range.

10:31.185 --> 10:33.881
I'll acquire the passwords.
You'll lead the conversation.

10:33.955 --> 10:35.722
He doesn't need
to say the words.

10:35.723 --> 10:37.557
Every word
in the English language

10:37.558 --> 10:39.659
is comprised
of 44 basic phonemes.

10:39.660 --> 10:42.288
He's likely to say most
in casual conversation.

10:42.396 --> 10:44.397
I'll shape them
into the words we need.

10:44.398 --> 10:47.094
You'll have less than an hour

10:47.168 --> 10:50.160
to get to the facility
before the passwords change.

10:51.606 --> 10:54.700
Dad, thanks.

10:55.243 --> 10:56.977
Marshall.

10:56.978 --> 10:59.503
Can you remember back to
the Aconcagua operation?

10:59.580 --> 11:01.014
Sydney's code name?

11:01.015 --> 11:04.246
Ms. Bristow?
It was Bluebird.

11:05.920 --> 11:07.520
Bluebird.

11:07.521 --> 11:09.689
So, it wasn't Freelancer.

11:09.690 --> 11:13.649
Freelancer? No, no,
it was Bluebird, definitely.

11:26.407 --> 11:27.941
Excuse me.

11:27.942 --> 11:29.276
Do you have a minute?

11:29.277 --> 11:31.111
Yeah.

11:31.112 --> 11:32.545
Yeah, of course.

11:32.546 --> 11:35.777
I feel so selfish
coming to you like this,

11:35.850 --> 11:39.479
especially knowing what you and
Emily must be going through.

11:39.553 --> 11:40.687
I'm sorry.

11:40.688 --> 11:41.922
Sydney.

11:41.923 --> 11:45.381
Okay, Sydney, keep him
away from his computer.

11:47.929 --> 11:50.096
What is it, Sydney?

11:50.097 --> 11:52.532
You can tell me.

11:52.533 --> 11:53.934
Come on.

11:53.935 --> 11:55.201
You can tell me.

11:59.707 --> 12:03.199
Got his prints. Still accessing
central security.

12:03.277 --> 12:06.212
I don't remember much
about my mother.

12:06.914 --> 12:09.940
When I think
of the things that I missed,

12:10.017 --> 12:12.918
the experiences I wish
I'd had with someone.

12:12.987 --> 12:15.455
Sitting in a garden talking.

12:15.456 --> 12:17.324
Now, look...

12:17.325 --> 12:19.592
I think I had
those things with Emily,

12:19.593 --> 12:21.695
and the thought
of losing that connection...

12:23.664 --> 12:26.164
Excuse me.

12:40.181 --> 12:42.215
Yeah?

12:42.216 --> 12:44.716
I'll be right there.

12:47.588 --> 12:49.856
When Emily was diagnosed
with cancer,

12:49.857 --> 12:53.088
the doctors predicted
that she had six months.

12:54.128 --> 12:56.262
That was three years ago.

12:56.263 --> 12:58.665
And, you know,
in a way, we're lucky.

13:00.534 --> 13:02.936
Thinking every day
may be her last

13:02.937 --> 13:05.238
has reminded us
how privileged we are

13:05.239 --> 13:06.840
to have her in our lives.

13:06.841 --> 13:08.908
We still need
the consonant "CH," Sydney,

13:08.909 --> 13:10.377
as in "choose. "

13:10.378 --> 13:12.145
I have to
get ready for this meeting.

13:12.146 --> 13:15.206
Did you and Emily ever think
about having children?

13:18.285 --> 13:21.186
What we do here, Sydney,
is more than just a career.

13:21.255 --> 13:24.656
I didn't think it would be fair
to bring someone into the world

13:24.759 --> 13:26.893
who couldn't really know
their father.

13:26.894 --> 13:30.057
Seeing the kind of woman
you've become,

13:30.164 --> 13:33.964
knowing that I had
something to do with it.

13:34.035 --> 13:36.697
That's as rewarding
as if I had a child of my own.

13:36.771 --> 13:38.104
Bastard.

13:38.105 --> 13:40.140
Child. Ch-ch-ch-ch. Choose.

13:40.141 --> 13:42.175
You have exactly 57 minutes

13:42.176 --> 13:44.676
before the passwords change.

14:05.699 --> 14:08.199
You had a cavity.

14:10.337 --> 14:14.296
Talk to me about
The Circumference.

14:15.509 --> 14:18.672
I don't know anything
about The Circumference.

14:19.680 --> 14:22.180
I swear to God.

14:24.418 --> 14:26.918
Please.

14:28.389 --> 14:29.756
No.

14:29.757 --> 14:31.291
No, no.

14:31.292 --> 14:32.292
No.

14:32.293 --> 14:34.793
No, no.

14:41.836 --> 14:43.002
As you know,

14:43.003 --> 14:46.200
The Alliance granted your
request to spare your wife.

14:46.273 --> 14:47.841
Your argument at the time

14:47.842 --> 14:50.367
was that she was suffering
from a terminal illness,

14:50.444 --> 14:52.944
but that is
no longer the case.

14:54.815 --> 15:00.549
Well, I propose
we bring Emily in.

15:01.455 --> 15:03.980
Emily spent eight years
in the State Department.

15:04.091 --> 15:06.226
She was a senior partner
at Rako...

15:06.227 --> 15:09.196
- Arvin.
- Emily will be an asset here.

15:09.263 --> 15:13.029
If I were in your position,
I might try to do the same,

15:13.100 --> 15:15.435
but it won't work.

15:15.436 --> 15:16.603
I am truly sorry,

15:16.604 --> 15:19.334
but these are the prescripts
of The Alliance.

15:19.406 --> 15:22.569
You don't know the kind of
mistake you are making here.

15:22.643 --> 15:25.942
As I said before,
threats will do no good.

15:26.013 --> 15:28.513
This threat might.

15:29.116 --> 15:32.017
It's not what I'll do
if you have Emily killed.

15:32.086 --> 15:33.820
It's what I won't do.

15:33.821 --> 15:36.346
The Alliance
is falling apart, Ramon.

15:36.423 --> 15:38.983
This organization is crumbling

15:39.093 --> 15:44.588
under the weight of corruption,
bureaucracy, infighting, fear.

15:44.698 --> 15:47.565
With enemies like Khasinau,
we live in a new world.

15:47.635 --> 15:49.169
You tell me that you think

15:49.170 --> 15:52.628
The Alliance is going to survive
under its current state?

15:55.843 --> 15:58.539
We need new leadership.

15:58.612 --> 16:01.410
With Briault and Poole gone,

16:01.448 --> 16:05.384
there are two empty chairs
around the partners' table.

16:05.452 --> 16:07.952
And you want one of them.

16:08.489 --> 16:10.989
I demand one of them.

16:13.093 --> 16:14.827
Arvin, I came here today

16:14.828 --> 16:17.353
not only to hear
your appeal for your wife,

16:17.464 --> 16:21.366
but because The Alliance
has already voted.

16:21.435 --> 16:23.536
And the agreement was unanimous.

16:23.537 --> 16:27.132
We acknowledged that you should
be admitted as full partner.

16:31.111 --> 16:33.546
Good.

16:33.547 --> 16:37.506
However,
this offer is contingent

16:37.585 --> 16:41.021
on your fulfilling
the other matter.

17:50.658 --> 17:52.792
I'm confused.
Why was I called in here?

17:52.793 --> 17:56.388
Mr. Weiss mentioned you were
suspicious about Sydney Bristow.

18:20.087 --> 18:22.221
When I mentioned
I was suspicious,

18:22.222 --> 18:24.722
I simply meant
Sydney seemed troubled.

18:24.758 --> 18:27.352
But that isn't the word
you used, is it?

18:42.710 --> 18:44.777
Rule.

18:44.778 --> 18:47.278
Dear.

18:48.515 --> 18:51.015
Choose.

19:19.713 --> 19:20.880
What I said was,

19:20.881 --> 19:23.714
I feel I have an understanding
of Sydney Bristow

19:23.784 --> 19:27.049
and that she doesn't
just accept problems.

19:27.121 --> 19:29.589
And that perhaps
Ms. Bristow and her father

19:29.590 --> 19:32.218
were trying to secure release
of Mr. Tippin?

19:32.326 --> 19:34.727
Is your opinion, Mr. Vaughn,

19:34.728 --> 19:37.163
that Ms. Bristow
is hiding something from you?

19:37.164 --> 19:39.664
From the Central
Intelligence Agency?

19:47.875 --> 19:50.375
Yes, sir.

19:57.918 --> 20:01.012
Records say Jack Bristow
checked into your location.

20:01.088 --> 20:02.755
Yeah. 20 minutes ago.

20:02.756 --> 20:04.123
Keep him there.

20:04.124 --> 20:06.624
Sir, he already left.

20:15.402 --> 20:20.567
In Aconcagua, when I was shot,
you radioed for help.

20:20.641 --> 20:23.337
You used the call sign
Freelancer.

20:23.410 --> 20:27.403
Sydney, your SD-6 call sign
was Bluebird.

20:29.616 --> 20:32.585
I want to give you
the benefit of the doubt.

20:32.653 --> 20:35.747
I even made excuses
for you in my head.

20:35.823 --> 20:41.284
Trouble is, I don't believe
any of those excuses.

20:44.965 --> 20:46.566
Who are you working for?

20:46.567 --> 20:49.067
And do not
play games with me.

20:49.837 --> 20:53.432
Dixon, you know that I would
never do anything to hurt you.

20:53.507 --> 20:56.601
I would never do anything
to betray what we believe in.

20:56.677 --> 21:00.704
How am I supposed to know
when you've been lying to me?

21:00.781 --> 21:03.281
I'm your partner.

21:03.951 --> 21:05.985
Just think about this
for a minute.

21:05.986 --> 21:08.580
Just think about everything
we've been through.

21:08.655 --> 21:11.155
Just think about who I am.

21:13.093 --> 21:15.495
Now, what I am gonna
ask you to do

21:15.496 --> 21:17.096
is just accept the fact

21:17.097 --> 21:19.895
that I cannot tell you
what this is about.

21:22.803 --> 21:25.303
What I am doing is classified.

21:28.442 --> 21:32.105
But, Dixon, I swear to you

21:32.179 --> 21:35.945
that I am not betraying
this country.

21:36.016 --> 21:38.017
I could never do that.

21:38.018 --> 21:40.518
You know that.

21:43.123 --> 21:46.456
I don't need rhetoric, Sydney.

21:46.560 --> 21:50.394
Right now I need a reason

21:50.464 --> 21:53.956
not to report you
to Security Section.

21:58.372 --> 21:59.372
Yeah.

21:59.373 --> 22:00.439
It's me.

22:00.440 --> 22:02.940
Jack? What the hell
are you doing?

22:02.976 --> 22:04.377
I'm saving someone's life.

22:04.378 --> 22:05.711
You may be destroying one.

22:05.712 --> 22:08.647
You just stole property
of the United States government.

22:08.715 --> 22:10.049
You'll get the solution back

22:10.050 --> 22:12.018
plus a copy
of the Rambaldi page.

22:12.019 --> 22:14.153
I've accepted your methods
for years,

22:14.154 --> 22:16.155
but there's a mole hunt
going on.

22:16.156 --> 22:17.557
Any leads on the mole?

22:17.558 --> 22:20.891
Well, so far,
I'm talking to the guy.

22:20.994 --> 22:23.329
I gave Haladki authority
to start an inquiry.

22:23.330 --> 22:25.197
He's got some good questions.

22:25.198 --> 22:27.860
Why you were willing
to risk Tippin's life,

22:27.935 --> 22:30.529
how you came to know
about The Circumference.

22:30.604 --> 22:33.232
This doesn't look good.
Come back to the office.

22:34.808 --> 22:37.076
We're friends, you and I.

22:37.077 --> 22:38.177
What?

22:38.178 --> 22:40.279
You'd consider us friends.

22:40.280 --> 22:42.481
Well, I used to.

22:42.482 --> 22:44.982
What the hell
are you talking about?

22:45.552 --> 22:48.052
I'll see you
when the job's done.

22:55.729 --> 23:00.132
A gentleman I know makes this
truth serum.

23:00.200 --> 23:01.834
I would have used it earlier,

23:01.835 --> 23:06.272
except that 1 in 5 men
who receives it

23:06.340 --> 23:09.207
has an unfortunate reaction.

23:12.479 --> 23:20.250
Results in paralysis,
among other things.

23:53.520 --> 23:57.320
Tell me about The Circumference.

23:59.259 --> 24:02.251
I don't know.

24:02.362 --> 24:04.862
I don't know.

24:04.865 --> 24:07.365
It's been six days.

24:08.435 --> 24:11.233
Will warned me
something might happen.

24:11.304 --> 24:14.467
He didn't even turn up
to his own awards dinner.

24:14.541 --> 24:16.075
Called his friends.

24:16.076 --> 24:18.576
They haven't heard
from him either.

24:22.082 --> 24:24.642
Are you going to publish
his story?

24:24.718 --> 24:25.885
Yeah.

24:25.886 --> 24:27.987
In the "A" section.

24:27.988 --> 24:30.156
I have to tell Deitrick
this is coming.

24:30.157 --> 24:33.752
Call Orsay in graphics.
Get a photo of Will.

24:35.762 --> 24:38.262
Then Dixon just turned
and walked away.

24:40.267 --> 24:42.334
I think he's gonna report me.

24:42.335 --> 24:44.370
If we have to deal
with that crisis,

24:44.371 --> 24:46.965
we'll deal with that crisis.

24:54.748 --> 24:57.248
Oh, my God.

24:58.719 --> 25:00.419
This device.

25:00.420 --> 25:02.980
I took it from Taipei last year.

25:03.056 --> 25:05.854
Two weeks ago, a report
came in through CIA

25:05.959 --> 25:07.760
claiming Khasinau's been looking

25:07.761 --> 25:09.929
for something
called The Circumference.

25:09.930 --> 25:11.731
Instructions describing a method

25:11.732 --> 25:14.100
of applying technology
Khasinau had acquired.

25:14.101 --> 25:16.626
This must be The Circumference.

25:16.703 --> 25:19.365
So if Khasinau
built one of these devices,

25:19.439 --> 25:21.964
this page would tell him
how to use it.

25:25.712 --> 25:27.113
Keep this safe.

25:27.114 --> 25:29.014
Wait, Dad.
What are you doing?

25:29.015 --> 25:31.643
We have to be in Taipei
in 16 hours.

25:31.718 --> 25:32.551
Keep your phone.

25:32.552 --> 25:34.587
I'll call you
when the plane's ready.

25:34.588 --> 25:37.088
Don't go home.

25:56.309 --> 25:58.177
How do you know
about The Circumference?

25:58.178 --> 26:00.840
You are out of your mind,
you know that?

26:14.795 --> 26:16.695
Aah!
Damn it, my eyes!

26:16.696 --> 26:17.963
Aah!

26:17.964 --> 26:19.732
Oh, God!

26:19.733 --> 26:22.067
How long have you worked
for Khasinau?

26:22.068 --> 26:25.037
Devlin said you mentioned
The Circumference.

26:25.105 --> 26:27.573
You don't have the clearance
to know what that is.

26:27.574 --> 26:28.974
You must have learned
about it from the outside.

26:28.975 --> 26:31.475
You son of a bitch!

26:32.179 --> 26:33.646
Aah!

26:33.647 --> 26:35.247
Do you work for Khasinau?

26:35.248 --> 26:37.416
No.

26:37.417 --> 26:38.617
Aah!

26:38.618 --> 26:40.119
Do you work for Khasinau?!

26:40.120 --> 26:42.620
You son of a bitch.

26:43.356 --> 26:45.856
Aaaaaah!

26:45.992 --> 26:47.126
Yes!

26:47.127 --> 26:49.627
I work for Khasinau, yes.

26:50.130 --> 26:52.231
- How long?
- Two years.

26:52.232 --> 26:54.466
Why does Khasinau
want The Circumference?

26:54.467 --> 26:56.468
It's the key
to something he's had built.

26:56.469 --> 26:58.470
Something he's built.
Tell me about it.

26:58.471 --> 27:01.497
It's a battery. All I know
is it's just a battery.

27:01.575 --> 27:04.100
- For what?
- I swear I don't know.

27:04.177 --> 27:06.839
Jack, Khasinau's the future.

27:06.913 --> 27:08.914
Where is this thing?
This battery?

27:08.915 --> 27:10.115
It's in Taipei.

27:10.116 --> 27:12.151
The Fu Sing district.

27:12.152 --> 27:14.587
At a warehouse.
Pang Pharmaceuticals.

27:14.588 --> 27:17.523
In an underground lab.
Room 47.

27:17.591 --> 27:20.492
You gave Khasinau information
about the safe house.

27:20.594 --> 27:24.030
Jack, this is a gift
I'm giving you.

27:24.097 --> 27:25.698
Khasinau can save you.

27:25.699 --> 27:27.233
You should be with him.

27:27.234 --> 27:31.170
You told him that my daughter
is a double agent with SD-6.

27:31.238 --> 27:33.272
Jack!
Look at yourself.

27:33.273 --> 27:36.071
You exposed Sydney.

27:36.142 --> 27:38.377
Come with me.

27:38.378 --> 27:39.478
I can save you.

27:39.479 --> 27:41.979
I can save you.

27:52.859 --> 27:55.487
Pacific surfliner to San Diego

27:55.595 --> 27:59.622
departing from Platform 5
in 15 minutes.

28:01.668 --> 28:04.168
Hey.

28:06.706 --> 28:09.206
Hi.

28:11.945 --> 28:14.280
How did you find me?

28:14.281 --> 28:15.948
You told me
a couple months ago

28:15.949 --> 28:18.611
that when you feel the need
to disappear,

28:18.685 --> 28:21.020
you go to the Observatory.

28:21.021 --> 28:23.546
The Observatory was closed.

28:23.623 --> 28:27.081
I remembered you said
the pier calmed you down,

28:27.160 --> 28:28.394
but you weren't there.

28:28.395 --> 28:30.663
You weren't at the Bluffs
or the Palisades.

28:30.664 --> 28:32.631
You didn't go
to all those places.

28:32.632 --> 28:34.867
Yeah, I did.

28:34.868 --> 28:38.770
Then I remembered you liked
the train station, too.

28:38.838 --> 28:42.137
Normal people
go to their normal jobs.

28:45.345 --> 28:47.870
I can't believe
you remember that.

28:50.150 --> 28:52.251
He's contacted you, hasn't he?

28:52.252 --> 28:54.752
Khasinau.

28:56.589 --> 28:59.089
And he wants the page.

29:01.428 --> 29:03.928
You're gonna give it to him.

29:06.032 --> 29:08.796
You came here to stop me.

29:15.375 --> 29:17.875
My father used to keep a diary.

29:18.778 --> 29:20.512
When I was a kid,
I used to say,

29:20.513 --> 29:22.648
"Hey, Dad,
only girls keep diaries,"

29:22.649 --> 29:25.914
and he'd just laugh.

29:25.986 --> 29:28.486
He was a really good guy,
my dad.

29:35.695 --> 29:38.097
But he was too hard on himself.

29:38.098 --> 29:40.332
I mean, he was
such a company guy

29:40.333 --> 29:43.393
that whenever he slipped up,
even in the slightest way,

29:43.470 --> 29:45.995
he took it so personally.

29:49.209 --> 29:51.905
There were a few operations...

29:54.481 --> 30:00.078
His last one, among them,
that he questioned.

30:00.153 --> 30:03.179
Operations he refused
to participate in.

30:05.525 --> 30:08.025
But only in his diary.

30:08.328 --> 30:11.923
He'd write out
what he wanted to say

30:12.032 --> 30:14.333
to the CIA director.

30:14.334 --> 30:17.394
Things he could
never say in real life.

30:21.841 --> 30:25.106
He was a company man,
and I loved him very much.

30:27.580 --> 30:30.080
But it killed him.

30:31.051 --> 30:33.551
Never questioning orders.

30:34.454 --> 30:36.954
His blind devotion to the job.

30:40.894 --> 30:43.454
If you're doing
what I think you're doing...

30:45.598 --> 30:49.762
I'm in, if you need me.

30:57.343 --> 30:59.843
Thank you.

31:12.759 --> 31:14.927
Who told you about this?

31:14.928 --> 31:16.095
I found a source.

31:16.096 --> 31:18.163
Khasinau's built
one of these devices,

31:18.164 --> 31:19.998
and it's in this warehouse.

31:19.999 --> 31:22.134
An underground lab, room 47.

31:22.135 --> 31:25.104
The meeting with Sark
is two hours from now.

31:25.171 --> 31:27.473
That means by the time
I hand over the page,

31:27.474 --> 31:29.074
you must have destroyed

31:29.075 --> 31:32.238
not only the device they've
built, but the lab itself.

31:32.312 --> 31:33.612
Destroying the device
should be easy.

31:33.613 --> 31:36.113
It's the size of a shoe.
What about the lab?

31:36.116 --> 31:38.949
It's a red mercury charge
with a mechanical fuse.

31:40.420 --> 31:43.150
I'll see what they need.

31:46.292 --> 31:48.954
I understand the risks
you've taken here.

31:49.062 --> 31:51.562
And you have
my respect for that.

31:55.301 --> 31:57.703
If he knew anything
about The Circumference,

31:57.704 --> 31:59.471
we would have heard it.

31:59.472 --> 32:00.973
I suspected as much.

32:00.974 --> 32:03.474
Prepare Mr. Tippin
for the exchange.

32:35.508 --> 32:36.508
Aah!

32:36.509 --> 32:39.009
1 out of 5!

32:39.212 --> 32:40.779
1 in 5!

32:47.253 --> 32:49.753
1 in 5!

32:50.223 --> 32:52.691
1 in 5!

33:28.027 --> 33:30.527
Arvin...

33:32.131 --> 33:34.631
I can't judge you
for what you do.

33:34.634 --> 33:37.262
I was never there.

33:37.337 --> 33:40.795
I was never faced with
the choices you had to make,

33:40.873 --> 33:43.373
and I have never...

33:48.381 --> 33:53.842
What I'm trying to say is,
I forgive you.

35:58.244 --> 36:00.744
Jack Bristow.

36:00.880 --> 36:02.614
Doing his daughter's work.

36:02.615 --> 36:05.516
There was speculation
you might make an appearance.

36:05.585 --> 36:07.185
If you're not comfortable,

36:07.186 --> 36:09.454
we can waive our business
for the night.

36:09.455 --> 36:10.789
Are you comfortable?

36:10.790 --> 36:12.090
Do you feel comfortable

36:12.091 --> 36:14.753
trading priceless documents
for a low-grade reporter?

36:14.861 --> 36:17.591
You should read Tippin's stuff.
It's not so bad.

36:17.697 --> 36:19.264
Let's see the artifacts.

36:19.265 --> 36:21.765
Let's see Tippin.

36:37.817 --> 36:40.317
Shall we?

36:41.521 --> 36:43.188
You've exposed the page.

36:43.189 --> 36:45.689
You would have done the same.

36:46.459 --> 36:47.993
When I activate
the surge inducer,

36:47.994 --> 36:50.462
you'll have 10 seconds
to cross the hallway.

36:50.463 --> 36:53.330
I'll go radio silent
until I'm in the lab.

36:53.399 --> 36:55.267
The parchment fibers
are consistent

36:55.268 --> 36:57.862
with the original
Rambaldi document.

36:57.937 --> 36:58.937
Yes.

36:58.938 --> 37:01.438
We have a deal.

37:03.276 --> 37:05.010
Please pass along
to your daughter

37:05.011 --> 37:07.673
how much I enjoyed
the stage show in Paris.

37:07.747 --> 37:10.247
She has her mother's
singing voice.

37:48.354 --> 37:50.854
Thank you.

37:55.328 --> 37:57.828
Thank you.

39:28.754 --> 39:33.521
Vaughn, it's bigger
than I thought.

39:39.065 --> 39:41.565
Syd, I can't hear you.

39:43.302 --> 39:44.769
If I turn this thing off,

39:44.770 --> 39:47.038
I'm gonna have to swim
out of here.

39:47.039 --> 39:50.270
You're breaking up.
Syd, I'm coming down.

43:04.370 --> 43:07.203
You're Alexander Khasinau.

43:09.875 --> 43:12.375
You should eat something.

43:15.181 --> 43:17.681
I'm not hungry.

43:27.827 --> 43:30.327
Wait.

43:31.630 --> 43:33.731
I have questions for you.

43:33.732 --> 43:35.967
You can ask my boss.

43:35.968 --> 43:38.468
Your boss?

43:38.671 --> 43:42.072
I thought "The Man"
was the boss.

43:42.708 --> 43:45.208
Yes.

43:45.377 --> 43:47.877
Yes, but I am not "The Man. "

44:09.301 --> 44:12.759
I have waited
almost 30 years for this.

44:18.611 --> 44:21.111
Mom?

44:22.305 --> 44:28.309
