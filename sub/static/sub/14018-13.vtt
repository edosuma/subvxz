00:00.795 --> 00:02.536
NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system

00:02.597 --> 00:06.511
the people are represented by two
separate yet equally important groups,

00:06.568 --> 00:08.377
the police
who investigate crime

00:08.436 --> 00:11.212
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

00:11.273 --> 00:12.911
These are their stories.

00:14.042 --> 00:15.851
You ain't got no J.
Come on. What you want?

00:16.044 --> 00:17.250
Oh!
I'm just warming up!

00:17.379 --> 00:19.017
Hey, Ms. G,
check this out!

00:19.080 --> 00:20.354
You want in? Slam dunk.

00:20.415 --> 00:22.759
Yeah. Hey, you want to impress
me, next time you get a job,

00:22.817 --> 00:25.388
show up five minutes before your
shift and not five minutes after.

00:25.487 --> 00:27.262
Their clock was fast,
just like me.

00:27.322 --> 00:29.598
The world is fast, Robert. Sometimes
you gotta run to keep up.

00:29.658 --> 00:30.728
(SCOFFS)

00:30.792 --> 00:31.964
Anyway, check this...
What?

00:32.027 --> 00:35.201
Check this now, Jordan,
Jordan goes for the three.

00:35.263 --> 00:36.537
He shoots.
He misses!

00:36.598 --> 00:37.906
Come on, man. I made that!

00:37.966 --> 00:39.172
(sun FIRING)

00:40.068 --> 00:41.342
(PEOPLE EXCLAIMING)

00:49.711 --> 00:51.315
ROBERT: Call 911. Somebody!

00:52.447 --> 00:55.189
Anybody in the neighborhood
have a beef with Ms. Gaylin?

00:55.383 --> 00:56.623
No one mess with Ms. G.

00:56.685 --> 00:59.666
You got a problem? She'd sit
with you long as it takes.

00:59.721 --> 01:02.201
Like little Lee, when his
mama had the swollen ankles,

01:02.357 --> 01:04.803
she straightened out what they needed
to get the prescription, you know.

01:04.858 --> 01:06.861
Right. I think
it was a drive-by.

01:06.928 --> 01:08.805
A drive-by?
Why, you hear a car?

01:08.863 --> 01:09.898
Mmm-hmm.

01:09.964 --> 01:11.034
All right. Thanks.

01:11.099 --> 01:12.134
You didn't hear a car?

01:12.334 --> 01:13.540
(CHATTERING OVER POLICE RADIO)

01:13.601 --> 01:14.705
She walked on water.

01:14.769 --> 01:16.271
And nobody saw anything.

01:16.338 --> 01:17.544
Somebody that popular,

01:17.605 --> 01:19.710
maybe one of the other
social workers was jealous.

01:19.774 --> 01:21.776
I don't know. One of the
kids thought he heard a car.

01:21.843 --> 01:25.120
Let's tell the uni's that
are doing the canvassing.

01:26.715 --> 01:27.921
You in charge?

01:27.982 --> 01:29.962
Detective Briscoe,
Detective Curtis.

01:30.018 --> 01:33.431
Doug Gaylin, Jennifer's father.
I got a call.

01:33.521 --> 01:34.932
What do we know so far?

01:34.989 --> 01:37.833
Well, so far, not too
much, unfortunately.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:29.611 --> 02:32.057
Jennifer worked for three
years in that center.

02:33.214 --> 02:38.163
After graduate school, she had offers
to teach at Columbia and Hunter.

02:39.554 --> 02:40.999
She chose Harlem.

02:41.189 --> 02:43.430
She ever talk about anyone
who was giving her trouble?

02:45.360 --> 02:47.499
You're looking for a motive?

02:48.863 --> 02:51.241
A white woman murdered
in a black neighborhood.

02:52.467 --> 02:53.741
Doesn't make it a race crime.

02:53.802 --> 02:57.443
Come on, Detective, she wasn't robbed.
They just shot her.

03:00.141 --> 03:02.178
I tried to protect her.

03:02.911 --> 03:05.323
Even set her up
in one of my own buildings.

03:05.413 --> 03:06.892
The last time
you saw your daughter?

03:06.948 --> 03:08.985
Last Sunday.
Dinner. Her apartment.

03:09.284 --> 03:10.558
Just the two of you?

03:10.618 --> 03:13.724
She got a phone call.
Took it in the other room.

03:14.556 --> 03:16.502
It didn't last very long.

03:17.325 --> 03:18.963
She came back,
she was white as a sheet.

03:19.394 --> 03:20.668
She say what it was about?

03:25.967 --> 03:27.469
CURTIS: So, she organized
these things, huh?

03:27.535 --> 03:30.209
Harlem AIDS walk, winter
coat drive for the homeless.

03:30.305 --> 03:32.911
Lot of good causes. Every week
she put up some new notices.

03:33.341 --> 03:34.945
Do you have a list
of her clients?

03:35.009 --> 03:36.579
Official, yeah.
But it won't help you.

03:36.644 --> 03:39.454
Unofficial people were
in and out all the time.

03:39.514 --> 03:41.892
There was never a problem
until three or four days ago.

03:41.950 --> 03:44.260
One of her favorites came in.

03:44.319 --> 03:45.855
She didn't want to see him.

03:45.920 --> 03:47.422
Randy Johnson.

03:47.488 --> 03:48.660
What do you mean,
"one of her favorites"?

03:48.756 --> 03:52.363
Jennifer would walk down the hall,
trailing five, six kids, a real posse.

03:52.427 --> 03:53.770
Pied Piper, huh?

03:53.828 --> 03:55.432
So what was he? The kid
who got left behind?

03:55.496 --> 03:58.409
Jennifer helped Randy
get a job with the PAL.

03:58.466 --> 03:59.911
Had a crush on her, I think.

04:00.268 --> 04:01.804
Serious?
Too serious.

04:02.504 --> 04:05.314
He must have become a nuisance
for her to avoid him like that.

04:05.373 --> 04:08.286
She'd make you want to do better.
Make you want to please her.

04:08.409 --> 04:09.888
Maybe you tried too hard.

04:09.978 --> 04:11.958
We heard she didn't want to
talk to you down at the center.

04:12.013 --> 04:13.583
You tried to call her.

04:13.648 --> 04:14.786
Who says?

04:14.849 --> 04:17.591
People said she was
trying to avoid you.

04:17.685 --> 04:20.723
The afternoon she was killed, you
want to tell us where you were?

04:20.788 --> 04:22.893
Hey, man, I was just
trying to help her.

04:23.925 --> 04:25.495
What was she doing, Randy?

04:26.794 --> 04:27.966
(SIGHS)

04:28.563 --> 04:30.236
Two weeks ago, Saturday night,

04:30.298 --> 04:32.539
I was up on Dyckman,
hanging out,

04:33.334 --> 04:36.144
then this car pulls up.
It's a white Audi.

04:37.138 --> 04:38.583
I didn't see the guy driving,

04:38.640 --> 04:41.484
but the passenger door opens
up and out comes Ms. G.

04:41.543 --> 04:42.613
What was she doing up there?

04:42.744 --> 04:45.918
What're any white folks doing up there?
Copping drugs.

04:46.214 --> 04:47.284
You sure?
Codeine.

04:48.850 --> 04:52.855
A lot of kids using it for a party
drug, a sex drug, what I mean.

04:54.389 --> 04:57.302
You know,
people ain't just one thing.

04:59.494 --> 05:01.030
It's all there
in the tox report.

05:01.162 --> 05:02.835
I spend my day
in a crisis center,

05:02.897 --> 05:05.309
I might need some
medication, too.

05:05.366 --> 05:06.367
Codeine.

05:06.434 --> 05:08.436
Mixed with acetaminophen,
prescription.

05:08.503 --> 05:10.881
Well, at least you don't
wake up with a headache.

05:10.939 --> 05:13.545
Liver damage.
Especially if you drink.

05:13.608 --> 05:15.281
Yeah, given the state
of her liver,

05:15.343 --> 05:17.448
she must have been gobbling
them down like cashews.

05:17.512 --> 05:18.957
Sex drug, huh?

05:19.013 --> 05:20.890
Second gunshot
was to her crotch.

05:21.015 --> 05:23.427
You located her playmate?
The guy driving the Audi?

05:23.484 --> 05:24.827
We searched her place.

05:24.886 --> 05:27.366
And went through her address book.
So far, no luck.

05:27.422 --> 05:29.834
Any other evidence
the girl liked to party?

05:29.924 --> 05:33.030
Well, judging by what
we found in her apartment,

05:33.795 --> 05:36.105
reading Vogue was about
as racy as she got.

05:36.164 --> 05:38.667
Maybe that's what someone
wants you to think.

05:38.733 --> 05:40.940
Her father owns the building?

05:41.436 --> 05:43.643
He'd have a key, wouldn't he?

05:44.372 --> 05:46.852
What time did Mr. Gaylin get
the news about his daughter?

05:46.908 --> 05:48.012
12:30, a little after.

05:48.076 --> 05:49.111
And where was he?

05:49.177 --> 05:50.781
His office, on 56th.

05:50.845 --> 05:52.722
How long you think it usually
takes to get from midtown

05:52.780 --> 05:54.088
to the center that time of day?

05:54.148 --> 05:55.559
About half hour?

05:55.617 --> 05:56.960
Something like that.

05:57.018 --> 06:00.022
You didn't get to the center until 2:30.
What took you so long?

06:00.088 --> 06:01.726
I'll let Mr. Gaylin
know you're here.

06:01.789 --> 06:04.463
Your job, Mr. Gaylin
pay you enough?

06:04.525 --> 06:05.560
Enough for what?

06:05.627 --> 06:08.733
Enough to go to jail
for obstruction of justice?

06:09.631 --> 06:10.871
We made a stop first.

06:10.932 --> 06:12.570
His daughter's place?

06:12.967 --> 06:14.469
He come out carrying anything?

06:14.535 --> 06:15.980
A duffel bag.

06:17.238 --> 06:21.448
I took a few things. Silver
baby cup, some of her poems.

06:21.509 --> 06:22.544
CURTIS: You mind
if we take a look?

06:22.610 --> 06:24.021
Nothing important.

06:24.078 --> 06:27.924
BRISCOE: Then you won't have any
objection to our going through it all?

06:28.650 --> 06:30.425
People misinterpret things.

06:30.485 --> 06:33.091
Like we might misinterpret
your reluctance.

06:33.187 --> 06:36.066
People will forget all the good she
did and just remember the scandal.

06:36.124 --> 06:38.695
And if her murder had
something to do with drugs...

06:43.064 --> 06:46.045
When I first heard
Jennie had been murdered,

06:46.100 --> 06:49.479
I thought I'd do anything
to find out who killed her.

06:51.806 --> 06:55.185
After I cleaned
out her apartment,

06:55.243 --> 06:57.780
I'm not so sure
I want to know who.

06:59.313 --> 07:00.519
Or why.

07:03.051 --> 07:05.895
CURTIS: Codeine,
percocet, dilaudid.

07:05.953 --> 07:09.457
BRISCOE: She should've been a
chemist instead of a social worker.

07:09.524 --> 07:10.798
Or a cop.

07:11.659 --> 07:13.605
Sex toys from A to Z.

07:13.661 --> 07:15.402
Everything you can't imagine.

07:15.496 --> 07:17.635
They're all wearing masks.

07:17.699 --> 07:19.508
You find out your
daughter's been murdered,

07:19.567 --> 07:21.103
you go to her apartment...

07:21.169 --> 07:22.614
Which means you know something.

07:22.670 --> 07:24.343
Or suspect something.

07:24.405 --> 07:27.716
And while you're looking
around, you find this stuff.

07:27.775 --> 07:29.755
When you think of your daughter,
you think of her, what?

07:29.844 --> 07:31.846
Six years old on a swing?

07:32.547 --> 07:37.223
The Pleasure Quest. Fantasies and
role-playing, Lafayette and...

07:37.285 --> 07:38.992
Great Jones Street.

07:40.722 --> 07:43.601
I've never been there.
I swear on a stack.

07:43.658 --> 07:44.659
(CHUCKLES)

07:45.193 --> 07:48.640
Everything we do is legal. Closer
to theater than to prostitution.

07:48.696 --> 07:52.269
Oh, somehow I don't think people
come here when Cats is sold out.

07:52.333 --> 07:54.973
Before you condemn what we do,
maybe you should try it out.

07:55.036 --> 07:57.277
I see enough
degradation on the job.

07:57.338 --> 07:59.511
Okay, about Jennifer Gaylin?

08:00.675 --> 08:03.053
I learned her real name when I
saw her picture in the papers.

08:03.144 --> 08:04.646
She come here often?

08:04.712 --> 08:08.524
She wasn't hardcore, but she
wasn't a tourist either.

08:08.583 --> 08:09.857
A weekend player.

08:09.917 --> 08:11.692
She come here alone?

08:12.220 --> 08:14.826
I'm not a social worker
or a priest, Detective,

08:14.889 --> 08:16.596
but I do have a
confidential relationship

08:16.657 --> 08:18.295
with the people who come here.

08:18.359 --> 08:19.360
Otherwise...

08:19.427 --> 08:21.338
Otherwise, it could be
a little embarrassing.

08:21.395 --> 08:22.897
We come around here at playtime

08:22.964 --> 08:25.808
and start questioning your
clients about Jennifer's death.

08:25.867 --> 08:27.505
And what makes you think
what happened to her

08:27.568 --> 08:29.946
had anything to do
with her harmless hobby?

08:30.004 --> 08:32.313
What makes you think it didn't?

08:33.174 --> 08:36.087
She used to come in with her
partner, that newscaster,

08:36.144 --> 08:39.523
what's his name,
uh, Stu Steiner.

08:40.280 --> 08:43.592
He wanted to get into a threesome.
She wasn't interested.

08:43.650 --> 08:46.996
That guy got a little out of control.
We had to throw him out.

08:47.054 --> 08:48.965
We don't like violence.

08:49.023 --> 08:50.024
(SCOFFS)

08:53.294 --> 08:55.968
Steiner doesn't show up on TV,

08:56.030 --> 08:58.840
that's how I figure
he's sick or out of town.

08:58.900 --> 09:00.243
You don't see him
around the building?

09:00.301 --> 09:02.747
Maybe 6:00, 6:30 in the
morning, he drives up.

09:02.870 --> 09:04.872
In a white Audi?
Yeah.

09:04.939 --> 09:07.749
He's going to bed when I'm
hosing down the sidewalk.

09:07.809 --> 09:08.879
So when's the last
time you saw him?

09:08.943 --> 09:11.116
Here? A week ago,
maybe two.

09:11.179 --> 09:13.159
On the evening news?
Three days ago.

09:13.214 --> 09:14.215
You ever see him with her?

09:14.282 --> 09:15.283
Now and then.

09:15.349 --> 09:16.987
Wanna open it up?

09:22.557 --> 09:23.729
You smoke cigars?

09:23.791 --> 09:24.895
Yeah.

09:24.959 --> 09:26.302
Light one.

09:42.944 --> 09:44.389
Always wear clean underwear,

09:44.445 --> 09:47.085
you never know when you
might be in an accident.

09:49.183 --> 09:53.495
Here it is. Three days ago. Last
time anybody came to see him.

09:53.554 --> 09:57.229
What's that say?
Jane Wilson? Wilton?

09:57.291 --> 09:59.464
You remember
what she looked like?

09:59.527 --> 10:02.906
She was tall.
Dark hair. Blue dress.

10:02.964 --> 10:05.570
Well, maybe it was a blue dress.
I wasn't paying attention.

10:05.633 --> 10:07.806
In 4:15, out 4:45.

10:07.869 --> 10:10.713
Hey, whatever they were doing, they
didn't waste any time on foreplay.

10:10.771 --> 10:13.377
Guess what we found
in Stu's cupboard?

10:13.441 --> 10:15.421
I bet it isn't Jurassic Park.

10:15.476 --> 10:17.513
CURTIS: The one in high heels,
that's Jennifer Gaylin.

10:17.578 --> 10:19.785
VAN BUREN: A social worker
with the emphasis on "social."

10:19.847 --> 10:22.020
The other woman could be the
brunette the doorman saw.

10:22.083 --> 10:23.118
Mmm-hmm.

10:23.184 --> 10:26.495
I guess the one
in the middle is Steiner.

10:26.554 --> 10:27.931
Be nice to find her.

10:27.989 --> 10:29.969
It's not Gaylin's
place or Steiner's.

10:30.024 --> 10:32.197
That sign outside the window...

10:32.260 --> 10:33.671
Chelsea Piers.

10:35.029 --> 10:38.033
Find someone who remembers
their trigonometry.

10:41.235 --> 10:43.374
FULLER: We needed two reference
points visible through the window.

10:43.437 --> 10:46.145
We used the upper northeast
corner of the sign

10:46.207 --> 10:48.278
and the top of this
driving range post.

10:48.342 --> 10:52.313
We project our line in this
direction and we get a plan view.

10:52.380 --> 10:54.621
And that would narrow
it down to about, what?

10:54.682 --> 10:55.786
20 buildings.

10:55.850 --> 10:57.420
Then you did
a section view, right?

10:57.485 --> 11:02.798
The sign is 63 feet off
the ground, the post is 96.

11:02.857 --> 11:04.768
You're obviously seeing
them through the window

11:04.825 --> 11:06.771
from a slightly
lower elevation,

11:06.827 --> 11:08.204
so it's gotta be
this building here.

11:08.262 --> 11:11.402
So you're hitting at about 40 or
50 feet off the sidewalk, then.

11:11.465 --> 11:15.174
It's real easy to be off a story
or two, but I'd say, yeah.

11:15.236 --> 11:17.079
You're talking about
the fourth or fifth floor.

11:18.205 --> 11:19.946
How'd you know that?

11:20.875 --> 11:22.047
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

11:22.109 --> 11:23.713
Oh! Sorry,
it must be a mistake.

11:23.778 --> 11:26.224
Oh! You must be looking
for my daughter, Debbie.

11:26.280 --> 11:28.624
She's throwing me
a birthday party.

11:28.683 --> 11:29.991
Can I help you?

11:30.051 --> 11:33.658
(CLEARING THROAT) Yeah, we'd
like to ask you a few questions

11:33.721 --> 11:36.031
about Jennifer Gaylin
and Stu Steiner.

11:36.090 --> 11:37.569
Who?

11:37.625 --> 11:40.105
We brought along a party tape.

11:40.161 --> 11:43.574
Maybe your mother's friends
would like to look at it.

11:43.631 --> 11:45.508
We can't talk in here.

11:46.667 --> 11:49.307
I knew them from around
the scene, not very well.

11:49.370 --> 11:52.214
If this is what you do with strangers,
what do you do with friends?

11:52.273 --> 11:53.718
Everyone has a hobby.

11:53.774 --> 11:55.253
How did you meet
Jennifer and Steiner?

11:55.309 --> 11:57.755
Mutual friends.
I partied with them twice.

11:57.812 --> 11:59.223
And the main feature?

11:59.280 --> 12:01.157
That was the first time.
We didn't tape the second.

12:01.215 --> 12:02.717
What, you got shy
all of a sudden?

12:02.783 --> 12:04.228
Just more of the same.

12:04.285 --> 12:06.026
We saw you getting some
pretty rough treatment

12:06.087 --> 12:07.589
from two people
who ended up dead.

12:07.655 --> 12:09.430
I didn't have anything
to do with that.

12:09.490 --> 12:13.370
A witness saw a tall brunette at
Steiner's place the day of the murder.

12:13.427 --> 12:15.771
I wasn't even
in town last week.

12:15.830 --> 12:18.367
Anyway, I never saw them
again after the second time.

12:18.432 --> 12:19.968
I wasn't a success with them.

12:20.034 --> 12:21.138
Could've fooled us.

12:22.503 --> 12:24.779
Stu was going
through the motions.

12:24.839 --> 12:27.046
His real passion was other men.

12:29.477 --> 12:32.617
Van Buren called Quantico to
check for leads through ViCAP.

12:32.680 --> 12:35.251
Now, they had three other cases
with similar enough MOs.

12:35.316 --> 12:38.593
Same caliber gun, knife
and torture before killing,

12:38.652 --> 12:40.359
mutilation of genitals.

12:40.421 --> 12:43.732
All the victims were active in
the alternative lifestyle scene.

12:43.791 --> 12:46.601
San Francisco, Aspen, Chicago.

12:46.660 --> 12:47.866
Worked his way east.

12:47.928 --> 12:50.408
Yeah, maybe he was
coming back home.

12:52.366 --> 12:57.008
He kills men, kills women, prefers a
knife, although a gun will do in a pinch.

12:57.071 --> 12:58.880
No signs of forced entry.

12:58.939 --> 13:01.476
In a couple of places,
Chicago, San Francisco,

13:01.542 --> 13:03.112
he really made himself at home,

13:03.177 --> 13:06.317
ate a sandwich, drank a
diet soda before splitting.

13:06.380 --> 13:09.384
Picked up any cash that was laying
around, left the credit cards.

13:09.450 --> 13:11.225
Pacific Heights, Beekman Place,

13:11.285 --> 13:12.992
East Belleview,
fancy addresses.

13:13.054 --> 13:15.762
Yeah. Jennifer's
wasn't too shabby, either.

13:15.823 --> 13:19.703
So all our victims are
Caucasian, rich and unmarried.

13:19.760 --> 13:24.140
Yeah. And educated. Kinderly
graduated Dartmouth in '88.

13:24.198 --> 13:26.610
Dorsett, University
of Pennsylvania, '86.

13:26.667 --> 13:28.669
Jennifer Gaylin,
Smith, also '88.

13:28.736 --> 13:29.976
Ivy League.

13:30.037 --> 13:33.314
Yeah, so when they called out in
pain, they had the right accents.

13:33.407 --> 13:35.887
So let's assume our killer
travels in the same circles.

13:35.943 --> 13:38.549
Where's Jennifer's
address book? It's here.

13:38.612 --> 13:40.717
And Steiner's.

13:40.781 --> 13:41.885
What do you got?

13:41.949 --> 13:43.360
Abrams?
Nope.

13:43.417 --> 13:46.694
This one starts with
"artist," Spencer Lee.

13:46.754 --> 13:49.325
Call San Francisco,
Aspen, Chicago.

13:49.390 --> 13:52.599
Ask them to fax us any address
books they got off the victims.

13:52.660 --> 13:55.402
We get a match,
maybe we get our killer.

13:57.465 --> 14:01.072
I just got a call from the captain
handling the case in Chicago.

14:01.135 --> 14:03.741
He wants to know what we got,
if we're holding out on him.

14:03.804 --> 14:07.479
Well, we got the same phone number
in three different address books.

14:07.541 --> 14:12.217
Chuck T. in Kinderly's, San
Francisco, Eddie in Densch's, Aspen,

14:12.279 --> 14:14.088
and Charles in Steiner's.

14:14.148 --> 14:19.222
Yep. And the number belongs to
Charles Thatcher, 353 West Broadway.

14:37.037 --> 14:38.345
(CLATTERING)

14:57.191 --> 14:58.898
Don't shoot,
don't kill me, please!

14:58.959 --> 15:01.337
CURTIS: No one's gonna kill you. Come on.
Step out of there. Let's go.

15:01.395 --> 15:02.499
Stand up.

15:02.563 --> 15:03.871
You got a permit
for this putter?

15:03.931 --> 15:05.308
I thought you
were somebody else.

15:05.366 --> 15:06.674
CURTIS: Take a seat.

15:06.734 --> 15:09.340
What, somebody who knew Stu
Steiner and Jennifer Gaylin?

15:11.272 --> 15:12.444
I thought I was next.

15:12.506 --> 15:13.610
CURTIS:
What do you mean, "next"?

15:14.575 --> 15:18.250
When I read the papers, I knew
it had to be Eddie Chandler.

15:18.812 --> 15:22.419
Who else? I knew Kinderly.
I knew Densch.

15:22.483 --> 15:23.791
I knew Eddie knew them.

15:23.851 --> 15:25.524
What made you think
he was coming after you?

15:26.520 --> 15:29.990
He called me.
He, um, said he wanted money.

15:31.125 --> 15:35.198
He said he'd call back today.
I was scared to death.

15:35.262 --> 15:36.764
Why didn't you call the police?

15:36.831 --> 15:37.969
You gotta be kidding.

15:38.032 --> 15:42.708
And everybody at work see my face in
a story about kinky sex murders? No.

15:42.770 --> 15:44.249
It's better than
seeing your dead body.

15:48.642 --> 15:50.918
Okay, if Eddie shows up,
give us a call.

15:52.646 --> 15:55.650
Don't go, please.

15:55.716 --> 15:57.525
What do you need?

15:57.585 --> 16:00.225
I knew Eddie when he first
came to New York,

16:00.287 --> 16:03.166
before he got into the whole S&M crowd.
I took care of him.

16:03.223 --> 16:06.363
If you felt like your life was in
danger, why didn't you just leave town?

16:06.427 --> 16:10.375
I walk out the door, maybe he's
across the street, watching?

16:10.431 --> 16:11.569
He follows me.

16:11.632 --> 16:15.978
I go to Aspen, he kills me in Aspen.
I lose him, he finds me.

16:16.036 --> 16:18.539
You could go to Omaha.

16:18.606 --> 16:20.984
Are you nuts?
Who goes to Omaha?

16:21.041 --> 16:22.179
(PHONE RINGING)

16:28.082 --> 16:31.529
Hello? Yeah.
Eddie, where you been?

16:32.853 --> 16:34.560
Um... Yeah.
Yeah, I got it.

16:36.724 --> 16:38.397
Sure. Yeah.
Come on up.

16:39.360 --> 16:41.067
He's on the corner.

16:41.128 --> 16:43.870
He's coming up from the
pay phone on the corner.

male going into the lobby.

16:45.733 --> 16:46.837
Does he have a key?

(ELEVATOR DINGS)

17:02.850 --> 17:05.626

MAN OVER RADIO:
Ten-four.

17:14.928 --> 17:16.669

CURTIS: Edward Chandler?

17:16.730 --> 17:18.334
What do you want?
What happened?

17:18.398 --> 17:19.570
Put your hands on the rail.

17:19.633 --> 17:20.771
Spread your legs.

17:20.834 --> 17:22.939
What's going on?
I wasn't doing anything.

17:23.002 --> 17:25.711
Yeah? What's this?
.38 Special.

17:25.772 --> 17:27.150
Suspect...
What's that?

17:27.207 --> 17:30.279
You're under arrest for the murders
of Jennifer Gaylin and Stu Steiner.

17:30.344 --> 17:32.017
You have the right
to remain silent.

17:32.079 --> 17:34.457
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

17:37.418 --> 17:41.025
I don't know why Charlie felt threatened.
What did he say?

17:41.088 --> 17:42.590
He was afraid.

17:43.324 --> 17:44.701
Oh.

17:45.025 --> 17:48.063
(LAUGHS) You know, Charlie always
had a sort of lurid imagination.

17:48.128 --> 17:50.005
You're sure you want
to get into this?

17:50.064 --> 17:51.099
Once we were coming
out of the movies,

17:51.165 --> 17:53.907
and there must have been a robbery across
the street or something, a mugging,

17:53.968 --> 17:58.883
and he literally dragged me across
the street to see what was going on.

17:58.939 --> 18:02.477
But you deal mostly in
murders, don't you, Detective?

18:02.543 --> 18:04.454
Two in particular, right now.

18:04.511 --> 18:06.991
Right, um, Jennifer and Stu.

18:07.047 --> 18:09.459
You don't have to talk to them.

18:09.516 --> 18:10.927
I know.

18:10.985 --> 18:15.627
Detective Curtis, is it?
Read me my rights.

18:17.191 --> 18:20.934
You have a wonderful voice, Detective,
but you know that, don't you?

18:21.028 --> 18:22.405
I'm glad you like it.

18:22.463 --> 18:24.602
Have you ever
killed a man or woman?

18:24.698 --> 18:25.699
ROSS: Mr. Chandler.

18:25.766 --> 18:27.939
Eddie, like Eddie Munster.

18:28.001 --> 18:30.242
You don't seem to be
taking this very seriously.

18:32.773 --> 18:36.949
No, I'd like to get
this straightened out.

18:37.011 --> 18:39.287
Believe me, I know
it's a serious offense,

18:39.346 --> 18:42.418
carrying an unlicensed
gun in this town.

18:42.483 --> 18:43.484
(CHUCKLES)

18:44.184 --> 18:47.097
Guess that's why I panicked when I saw
Detective Curtis coming after me.

18:47.154 --> 18:49.964
You think that's why you were arrested?
For unlicensed possession?

18:50.858 --> 18:52.599
I'd have gotten myself
arrested a lot sooner

18:52.660 --> 18:55.504
if I'd known there were D.A.'s
who look like you, Ms. Ross.

18:57.865 --> 19:00.038
Remington .38
Special's from Jennifer.

19:00.100 --> 19:02.410
Western .38
Special's from Stu.

19:02.469 --> 19:05.814
All the slugs had five lands and
grooves with a right twist.

19:05.873 --> 19:09.411
Same gun. Must have smacked
Steiner in the head, too.

19:09.476 --> 19:12.787
We got his blood and hair
samples on the gun barrel.

19:15.182 --> 19:18.527
Detective Briscoe, your partner
is being very cruel to me.

19:18.585 --> 19:20.895
The last time someone had me in
cuffs, they were a lot nicer.

19:21.989 --> 19:24.060
Where did you get
the gun, Mr. Chandler?

19:25.526 --> 19:27.699
She sounds so serious.

19:27.761 --> 19:29.741
A friend gave it to me.

19:30.631 --> 19:34.044
So I could protect myself when
I brought new playmates home.

19:34.101 --> 19:35.102
When I had a home.

19:35.402 --> 19:36.403
And when was that?

19:36.570 --> 19:40.484
Uh... Well, it was before I left New
York the last time, I know that.

19:40.541 --> 19:41.781
And you've had it since then?

19:43.911 --> 19:46.687
The bullets that killed both
Jennifer Gaylin and Stu Steiner

19:46.747 --> 19:48.749
came from your gun.

19:49.249 --> 19:51.058
Go get him arraigned.

19:53.420 --> 19:55.195
It's kind of amazing,
Chandler's compulsion

19:55.255 --> 19:56.962
to come on to
everyone in the room.

19:57.024 --> 19:59.231
A kind of pathological charm.

20:00.094 --> 20:01.869
Anything a jury
might respond to?

20:01.929 --> 20:03.636
(SIGHS) I don't think so.

20:03.697 --> 20:06.507
I'd be happier if we could
place him at either scene.

20:06.567 --> 20:10.379
Wasn't there a brunette
at Steiner's apartment?

20:10.437 --> 20:12.246
Yeah, and a witness
saw a brunette driving away

20:12.306 --> 20:15.344
from the community center
where Gaylin worked.

20:15.409 --> 20:16.444
WOMAN: Mr. McCoy?

20:16.510 --> 20:18.251
So, Chandler has an accomplice?

20:18.312 --> 20:20.519
Or he likes to
play dress-up.

20:22.449 --> 20:24.588
Greenwald filed a motion
to suppress the gun.

20:24.918 --> 20:26.022
(SCOFFS)

20:29.490 --> 20:33.461
GREENWALD: My client was chased
by the police and apprehended

20:33.527 --> 20:36.235
because he was running
through the streets.

20:36.296 --> 20:39.766
Running can't justify
stopping an alleged suspect.

20:39.833 --> 20:41.506
People v. Sierra.

20:41.568 --> 20:42.706
JUDGE SAMUEL: Sierra?

20:42.769 --> 20:46.012
Don't you mean People v.
Martinez, Mr. Greenwald?

20:46.073 --> 20:50.886
Sierra, Martinez. After 40 years,
they all start to sound alike.

20:50.944 --> 20:54.824
Your Honor, the officers were not acting
solely in response to the running.

20:54.882 --> 20:56.691
They stopped Mr. Chandler
because they believed

20:56.750 --> 20:58.491
someone matching
his description

20:58.552 --> 21:00.998
was involved in a criminal
activity, People v. Reid.

21:01.054 --> 21:04.524
What exactly was the basis
for this belief, Mr. McCoy?

21:04.591 --> 21:08.437
He showed up at the apartment of a
former acquaintance, Mr. Thatcher,

21:08.495 --> 21:09.974
in an effort to extort
money from him.

21:10.030 --> 21:12.840
To borrow money
from an old friend.

21:12.900 --> 21:16.507
An old friend who felt it necessary
to arm himself with a golf club.

21:16.637 --> 21:21.108
So the guy's paranoid. So what
else is new in this farkakte town?

21:21.175 --> 21:24.349
JUDGE SAMUEL: Mr. McCoy, if
we had the police taking off

21:24.411 --> 21:27.688
after every suspicious-looking
runner in this city,

21:28.582 --> 21:30.493
we'd all be in trouble.

21:32.653 --> 21:35.293
Motion granted.
The gun is suppressed.

21:36.623 --> 21:38.569
No weapon, no opportunity.

21:38.625 --> 21:41.834
There's got to be something else
to tie this guy to the murders.

21:41.895 --> 21:44.842
Where's Chandler been living
since he blew back into town?

21:44.898 --> 21:46.878
He might've been
staying with a friend.

21:46.934 --> 21:49.346
Assuming he still
has any. Alive.

21:51.939 --> 21:53.475
(LAUGHING) Where's Eddie
been staying?

21:54.141 --> 21:57.247
The time was, that would
have been an easy one.

21:57.311 --> 22:00.622
In bed with whoever was
the most eligible that week.

22:00.681 --> 22:03.525
Years ago, when he first
came to New York,

22:04.485 --> 22:08.228
he was like this corn-fed
Adonis, to die for.

22:08.288 --> 22:09.528
He had this
wonderful innocence.

22:10.424 --> 22:13.803
He thought people were being nice to
him because they really loved him.

22:13.861 --> 22:15.363
But you did?

22:15.629 --> 22:16.664
(CHUCKLES)

22:16.730 --> 22:20.371
Yeah. Nice clothes, fancy
meals, expensive vacations.

22:21.235 --> 22:24.614
Eddie never realized that everything
had a price tag, even him.

22:24.671 --> 22:25.911
Especially him.

22:25.973 --> 22:27.213
How did you two break up?

22:27.274 --> 22:30.414
I wasn't rich enough.
Nowhere near.

22:30.477 --> 22:32.252
But he'd still come by?

22:32.312 --> 22:34.314
Uh, up until about
two years ago.

22:34.381 --> 22:37.123
He'd get lonely.
He'd come over.

22:37.184 --> 22:41.360
We would microwave some popcorn,
and watch TV for hours.

22:42.456 --> 22:44.436
And then he would just leave.

22:44.491 --> 22:48.769
No kiss, no goodbye, just pick
up his jacket and wander off.

22:48.829 --> 22:49.830
For?

22:49.897 --> 22:52.878
A house in East Hampton.
I drove him there once.

22:52.933 --> 22:54.344
Do you have a name?

22:54.401 --> 22:59.544
It was a big cape behind a picket
fence on Lily Pond Lane, I think.

22:59.606 --> 23:02.109
It was painted
this God-awful blue.

23:02.976 --> 23:05.286
God, Eddie's let himself go.

23:05.345 --> 23:08.451
When you two were together,
did you know about his past?

23:08.515 --> 23:09.550
His boyfriends?

23:10.183 --> 23:11.321
(LAUGHS)

23:11.385 --> 23:13.331
Like Eddie, I'm not
fussy about beauty.

23:14.321 --> 23:16.767
Eddie was drop-dead gorgeous,
but hardly naive.

23:16.823 --> 23:21.465
By the time I got him, he was like a
waiter in a really good restaurant,

23:21.528 --> 23:23.940
helping you
choose from the menu.

23:24.297 --> 23:27.141
But he always let you know
the price, in advance.

23:27.200 --> 23:28.679
And you could afford him?

23:30.937 --> 23:34.680
You know, I was the one that first
introduced Steiner to Eddie.

23:34.741 --> 23:37.688
At my summer place. The blue
house on Lily Pond Lane.

23:37.778 --> 23:38.813
I could give you the number.

23:39.446 --> 23:40.618
I like the mountains.

23:40.681 --> 23:43.457
You should try the ocean
for a change. It's wetter.

23:44.751 --> 23:46.526
How did you and Eddie end?

23:48.055 --> 23:50.501
He started losing some
of that amazing beauty.

23:50.557 --> 23:53.197
Why stick with a nine,
when you can afford a 10?

23:53.260 --> 23:54.898
Then he dropped
completely out of sight.

23:54.961 --> 23:55.962
You never heard from him?

23:56.029 --> 23:58.737
Actually, I did receive a couple
of notes from him recently.

23:58.799 --> 24:01.678
Written on, of all things,
history department stationary,

24:01.735 --> 24:03.408
Hudson University.

24:04.671 --> 24:07.015
I don't suppose he joined
the faculty, do you?

24:10.110 --> 24:11.316
STEVENSON: I don't
think I can help you.

24:11.378 --> 24:12.652
Off the record?

24:12.713 --> 24:14.715
I have two grown
children and an ex-wife.

24:14.815 --> 24:16.817
She won't know we talked.

24:18.185 --> 24:19.425
Off the record.

24:25.225 --> 24:30.641
I first met Eddie about,
oh, let me think...

24:33.367 --> 24:35.472
I guess it must be
three months ago now.

24:36.436 --> 24:41.909
He was intelligent,
charming, lonely.

24:42.142 --> 24:43.519
And you enjoyed his company?

24:43.577 --> 24:44.681
Except when he drank.

24:44.745 --> 24:46.952
Then all that charm curdled.

24:47.481 --> 24:53.454
Eddie would rage at the people who had
"discarded" him, is the word he used.

24:53.553 --> 24:55.430
How long did he stay,
Mr. Stevenson?

24:55.489 --> 24:58.561
Three days, then he'd
disappear for four or five,

24:58.992 --> 25:01.165
come back for a night,
then vanish again.

25:02.596 --> 25:06.203
I had a pair of diamond cuff
links, belonged to my father.

25:06.266 --> 25:08.303
I assumed Eddie stole them.

25:09.603 --> 25:12.709
I can see him as a thief,
but as a killer, no.

25:14.975 --> 25:16.955
I guess I might have
been next on his list.

25:17.544 --> 25:18.784
Do you have any idea
where he'd go?

25:19.346 --> 25:22.088
Uh, he said he stayed with
some friends in Westchester.

25:22.816 --> 25:24.591
I let him use my car.

25:25.218 --> 25:26.856
Otherwise it just
sits in the garage.

25:27.220 --> 25:28.961
Is it there now?

25:29.022 --> 25:30.729
Oh, I haven't been
down there in weeks.

25:31.958 --> 25:32.959
STEVENSON: What a mess.

25:33.026 --> 25:35.506
Looks like he just camped out
down here, eating, sleeping.

25:38.465 --> 25:39.808
Whoa! Whoa!

25:39.866 --> 25:42.142
I tell you one thing
he didn't do, bathe.

25:42.669 --> 25:44.410
Why would Eddie
sleep down here?

25:44.671 --> 25:47.447
He could have been more
comfortable upstairs with me.

25:48.642 --> 25:50.212
BRISCOE: Hello.

25:52.179 --> 25:55.456
Allow me to introduce you
to our mystery brunette.

25:56.083 --> 25:57.790
We've got Chandler's
prints in the car.

25:57.918 --> 26:00.398
He'll say Stevenson
gave him a ride.

26:00.487 --> 26:02.899
JACK: We need Stevenson to say
he loaned the car to Chandler.

26:03.056 --> 26:04.865
That connects Chandler
to the wig and dress.

26:04.925 --> 26:06.495
Which puts him at
both the crime scenes.

26:06.560 --> 26:09.632
And while you're at it,
get the weapon back in.

26:09.963 --> 26:11.601
WOMAN: Mr. McCoy?

26:12.799 --> 26:14.278
Notice of substitution.

26:16.403 --> 26:18.940
Greenwald's been replaced
by Neil Pressman.

26:19.306 --> 26:22.150
That Harvard opportunist.
How did Chandler manage that?

26:22.442 --> 26:25.753
The question isn't how.
It's how come.

26:29.282 --> 26:31.592
JACK: Professor Stevenson connects
your client to the Honda,

26:31.651 --> 26:33.392
and that connects him
to the dress and wig.

26:33.453 --> 26:35.262
And before I can
say "Antonin Scalia,"

26:35.322 --> 26:37.097
you're arguing
inevitable discovery.

26:37.390 --> 26:40.030
We get the gun back in, and your
client's going down for murder one.

26:40.393 --> 26:42.600
PRESSMAN: That's on the theory
that the victims were tortured.

26:42.929 --> 26:44.340
JACK: Very good,
Mr. Pressman.

26:44.631 --> 26:46.907
Now try guessing
what offer we'll make.

26:47.100 --> 26:50.445
Let's see, going on what my teaching
assistants told me about you,

26:50.504 --> 26:52.950
you're going to take the
death penalty off the table

26:53.373 --> 26:56.445
and then you're going to give my
client the opportunity to rot in jail

26:56.510 --> 26:59.354
for the rest of his life without the
possibility of parole, am I right?

26:59.546 --> 27:00.957
Took the words
right out of my mouth.

27:01.014 --> 27:02.049
(SCOFFS)

27:02.115 --> 27:04.959
Don't waste your sympathies on
those people who died, Mr. McCoy.

27:05.218 --> 27:06.424
You mean the ones you murdered?

27:06.486 --> 27:07.658
The ones somebody murdered.

27:10.957 --> 27:15.531
When I was a boy, I used to watch
On the Town over and over.

27:16.630 --> 27:20.339
And But Not for Me. You
know that one, Mr. McCoy?

27:21.368 --> 27:25.544
Clark Gable is a Broadway producer.
And Miracle on 34th Street.

27:26.239 --> 27:30.949
Oh, I thought New York was filled with
colorful people, romantic people,

27:32.078 --> 27:36.026
people who lived wonderful,
exciting, interesting lives.

27:39.019 --> 27:43.764
You know what I found?
Monsters.

27:46.293 --> 27:48.739
People who preyed
on the innocent,

27:49.729 --> 27:53.541
corrupted them, destroyed them.

27:57.170 --> 27:58.979
I was 17 years old.

28:00.407 --> 28:03.115
(SCOFFS) Do you think
they carded me?

28:03.944 --> 28:07.858
Do you think they cared
if I was 17,16,14?

28:14.187 --> 28:16.224
I didn't kill them,
Mr. McCoy.

28:17.157 --> 28:19.763
But they killed
the boy I used to be,

28:19.993 --> 28:22.803
and if they hadn't been stopped,
they'd have killed other boys,

28:22.862 --> 28:24.034
other girls,

28:25.699 --> 28:27.372
as many as they
could get their hands on.

28:31.171 --> 28:36.211
Those S&M games they played, they were
rehearsing what happened to them.

28:42.983 --> 28:44.291
He's really something,
isn't he?

28:46.386 --> 28:48.366
So was Ted Bundy.

28:49.689 --> 28:53.102
You want to avoid his fate,
Mr. Chandler, you consider our offer.

28:53.793 --> 28:56.672
PRESSMAN: Well, that's a no. So,
I guess we're going to trial.

28:56.796 --> 28:59.333
A real trial, Mr. Pressman.
Not moot court.

28:59.399 --> 29:00.707
(CHUCKLING)

29:00.767 --> 29:03.714
Don't worry, Mr. McCoy, I won't
bump into the furniture. Let's go.

29:11.378 --> 29:13.187
Off the record?
That's what you said.

29:13.246 --> 29:14.953
The situation's changed.

29:15.015 --> 29:16.722
And you want me to
testify to a grand jury

29:16.783 --> 29:19.457
so my children will know I shared
my bed with a serial killer?

29:19.519 --> 29:21.897
If you don't help us, there's
a good chance he'll go free.

29:21.955 --> 29:23.730
That's your problem!

29:25.091 --> 29:26.900
Without him, we can't get
the gun back in. (SIGHING)

29:28.061 --> 29:30.439
The right judge might allow
my testimony of what he said.

29:30.497 --> 29:33.808
The right brain-dead judge.
It would still be hearsay.

29:34.367 --> 29:36.472
Unless we charge him
with aiding and abetting.

29:38.038 --> 29:39.881
ROSS: Professor Stevenson
incriminated himself

29:39.939 --> 29:42.078
when he told me he lent
Mr. Chandler his car.

29:42.709 --> 29:45.212
His admission was a statement
against penal interest.

29:45.278 --> 29:47.519
It's admissible as an exception
to the hearsay rule.

29:47.647 --> 29:48.682
Okay. It's a dodge,
Your Honor.

29:48.748 --> 29:51.285
The only reason that they charged
Professor Stevenson in the first place

29:51.351 --> 29:52.591
was to get his statement in.
I guarantee you,

29:52.652 --> 29:53.722
the minute this
hearing is over,

29:53.787 --> 29:55.289
they're gonna drop
the charges against him.

29:56.156 --> 29:57.260
Are you, Mr. McCoy?

29:58.291 --> 29:59.895
Barring new information, no.

30:00.360 --> 30:02.704
All right.
The statement's in.

30:02.862 --> 30:06.469
Then, Your Honor, we'd like to
re-examine your suppression of the gun.

30:06.700 --> 30:08.077
I told you, Your Honor.
He's bootstrapping.

30:08.468 --> 30:10.345
(CHUCKLING) And doing
a damn good job at it.

30:10.403 --> 30:12.940
We can now link his client to
evidence, the dress and the wig

30:13.006 --> 30:14.644
that places him
at two crime scenes.

30:15.208 --> 30:17.882
That gives us grounds
to search his client.

30:18.011 --> 30:19.752
And that search would've
turned up the murder weapon.

30:19.913 --> 30:21.256
Would've? Might've.

30:21.314 --> 30:22.691
It's not called
probable discovery,

30:22.749 --> 30:24.092
it's called
inevitable discovery.

30:24.150 --> 30:25.322
People v. Fitzpatrick.

30:25.385 --> 30:28.423
Don't you get the law journal up at Harvard?
People v. Ruff in.

30:28.721 --> 30:30.826
Covers items that likely
would've been discovered

30:30.890 --> 30:32.597
in the normal course
of an investigation.

30:32.792 --> 30:34.965
And so it does.

30:35.729 --> 30:39.336
All right, Mr. McCoy,
you got your gun back.

30:44.404 --> 30:47.544
He cut Mr. Steiner over
30 times, some deep cuts,

30:47.607 --> 30:49.450
some superficial,
before he shot him.

30:49.642 --> 30:51.781
JACK: And what conclusion did
you draw from these injuries?

30:51.845 --> 30:54.655
I'd say they were designed
to inflict maximum pain

30:54.714 --> 30:56.955
while keeping the victim
alive and conscious.

30:59.552 --> 31:04.023
Dr. Rodgers, is it fair to say
that the killer deliberately

31:04.224 --> 31:06.363
caused the greatest possible
suffering in his victims?

31:06.426 --> 31:07.427
Yes.

31:07.494 --> 31:09.633
Would you say this seems
like the work of a sociopath?

31:09.996 --> 31:12.476
Psychopathology isn't
my field, Mr. Pressman.

31:13.533 --> 31:15.638
But it's not something
that you see every day.

31:15.869 --> 31:16.870
Hmm.

31:17.303 --> 31:18.714
Thank you.

31:18.872 --> 31:19.873
(PRESSMAN CLEARS THROAT)

31:20.140 --> 31:23.986
Eddie called me up and said
he wanted money, $20,000.

31:24.677 --> 31:27.021
He said he'd come to my
apartment in two days.

31:28.114 --> 31:29.525
Um, he said I'd better
have the money.

31:30.483 --> 31:31.723
Did you take that as a threat?

31:35.121 --> 31:36.327
Absolutely.

31:36.923 --> 31:37.993
Thank you.

31:38.591 --> 31:42.630
Mr. Thatcher, what made you think
that Eddie Chandler threatened you?

31:43.496 --> 31:45.498
Because I know him, intimately.

31:45.698 --> 31:48.474
When you lived together, he was
preoccupied with violence, wasn't he?

31:48.535 --> 31:52.108
Yes, um, he'd rent videos
with lots of gore in them.

31:52.705 --> 31:54.616
What else did he watch?

31:54.908 --> 31:57.616
TV shows, Road Runner cartoons.

31:57.677 --> 31:59.554
He could watch
that stuff for hours.

32:00.013 --> 32:01.014
Hmm.

32:01.347 --> 32:02.690
Thank you.

32:04.150 --> 32:06.858
He can't be going for an insanity defense.
It's too late.

32:07.020 --> 32:08.294
There's something
we're not seeing.

32:08.354 --> 32:09.458
We're not supposed to.

32:09.522 --> 32:11.866
Not until it comes up
and bites us on the ass.

32:12.025 --> 32:14.972
It's from Pressman. An
addition to his witness list.

32:15.628 --> 32:17.801
US Representative Fred Maxwell.

32:18.531 --> 32:20.169
Maxwell?

32:20.233 --> 32:21.803
I'd say you've just been bit.

32:22.769 --> 32:26.512
Your Honor, this witness has
absolutely no relevance to this case.

32:26.573 --> 32:28.610
I intend to argue mitigating
circumstances, Your Honor.

32:28.675 --> 32:31.155
Prolonged exposure
to excessive TV violence

32:31.211 --> 32:33.213
led to sociopathic behavior
on the part of my client.

32:33.279 --> 32:36.283
He can say Moonbeams or
Twinkies made his client do it,

32:36.349 --> 32:38.386
it's still not
appropriate testimony.

32:38.451 --> 32:40.556
If I can show impact
on his behavior, why not?

32:40.787 --> 32:42.664
Why not, indeed,
Mr. McCoy?

32:43.356 --> 32:46.098
I'm not going to deny
Mr. Chandler a defense.

32:46.225 --> 32:49.604
Your Honor, Mr. Pressman is using a
political hot button to confuse the jury.

32:49.662 --> 32:52.666
Then unconfuse them. I'm
going to allow his witness.

32:55.835 --> 32:58.111
I've been against
violence my entire life.

32:58.171 --> 33:00.378
ADAM: I'm acquainted with
your career, Congressman.

33:01.474 --> 33:04.944
Song lyrics,
movies, television shows.

33:05.011 --> 33:06.547
You've been quite outspoken.

33:06.613 --> 33:11.221
And now this clown, Pressman, wants me
testifying in defense of a serial killer.

33:12.118 --> 33:14.621
A damn gay serial killer
into kinky sex.

33:14.754 --> 33:17.496
Pressman's no clown.
He's a ringmaster.

33:17.557 --> 33:19.366
And you're his star attraction.

33:19.559 --> 33:20.765
Just get me off the hook.

33:20.827 --> 33:21.965
Nothing I can do.

33:22.462 --> 33:25.068
Look on the upside,
if Chandler's acquitted,

33:25.131 --> 33:27.611
your movement gets
its very own Willie Horton.

33:30.970 --> 33:33.541
I'm the chairman of the
National Advisory Committee

33:33.606 --> 33:34.983
on Television Violence.

33:35.675 --> 33:38.884
PRESSMAN: And you've sponsored bills to
regulate the content of primetime TV shows?

33:39.145 --> 33:40.215
Yes.

33:40.313 --> 33:42.919
Now, isn't it true that
your committee believes

33:42.982 --> 33:47.328
that there is a one-to-one correlation
between watching violent acts on TV

33:47.587 --> 33:49.999
and aggressive, anti-social
behavior in real life?

33:50.056 --> 33:51.057
Yes.

33:51.124 --> 33:53.229
And isn't it true that you
found among young people

33:53.293 --> 33:55.569
who've been convicted
of violent acts,

33:55.628 --> 33:57.869
an alarmingly high
percentage of them,

33:57.931 --> 34:00.571
we're talking somewhere
in the neighborhood of 80%,

34:00.934 --> 34:03.540
spent most of their leisure
time watching violent TV?

34:04.170 --> 34:05.240
Yes.

34:05.805 --> 34:09.650
All right. Now, this is Defense's
exhibit 43, Your Honor.

34:09.708 --> 34:13.282
It's a report by the US Advisory
Board on Child Abuse and Neglect.

34:13.346 --> 34:14.984
Would you read
the marked passage, please?

34:15.982 --> 34:19.725
"The dynamic visual image has
a unique psychological effect"

34:19.853 --> 34:22.356
"that is not shared by the
written or spoken word"

34:22.789 --> 34:24.427
"or still graphic image."

34:24.489 --> 34:25.560
Do you agree with that?

34:26.225 --> 34:28.068
Yes, sir, I do.

34:28.127 --> 34:30.572
Your Honor, Defense's 44.

34:30.663 --> 34:35.304
This is a copy of a speech Representative
Maxwell made in Denver last year.

34:35.368 --> 34:37.712
Again, would you
read the marked passage?

34:39.339 --> 34:44.014
"I blame violent TV shows for the epidemic
of violence among today's youth."

34:44.476 --> 34:47.650
So, aren't you by implication,

34:47.714 --> 34:50.922
comparing these TV
shows to a disease?

34:51.583 --> 34:53.085
Something that
causes an epidemic.

34:53.152 --> 34:54.152
You could say that.

34:54.219 --> 34:57.292
Well, then, if these TV shows
are an equivalent to a disease,

34:57.357 --> 35:00.395
aren't the people affected by
them in some sense victims?

35:00.727 --> 35:03.833
I suppose in some sense, yes.

35:07.233 --> 35:08.940
Congressman, you don't
like my client, do you?

35:09.068 --> 35:14.142
No. And I think it would be a
serious miscarriage of justice

35:14.240 --> 35:16.811
if he were not found guilty
of first-degree murder.

35:17.176 --> 35:21.090
But this issue is so important, I would
rather see Mr. Chandler go free...

35:21.147 --> 35:22.148
Objection.

35:22.215 --> 35:24.058
Your Honor, the Congressman
is an expert in this area.

35:24.117 --> 35:25.926
His testimony is relevant to
the case that I'm presenting.

35:26.152 --> 35:28.098
I'll let him
finish his thought,

35:28.154 --> 35:30.065
but that's as far
as I'm going to go.

35:30.390 --> 35:31.926
Thank you, Your Honor.

35:34.093 --> 35:36.369
I would rather see
Mr. Chandler go free

35:36.562 --> 35:40.942
if it would help stem the tide of violence
and depravity overwhelming our society.

35:42.468 --> 35:44.379
Thank you, Congressman.

35:50.710 --> 35:52.155
Congressman,

35:54.914 --> 35:58.623
is there a difference between
a correlation and a cause?

36:00.420 --> 36:01.421
How do you mean?

36:01.487 --> 36:03.626
If 80% of juvenile
offenders chew gum,

36:03.690 --> 36:05.931
are we to assume that
gum chewing causes crime?

36:05.992 --> 36:06.993
No.

36:07.060 --> 36:11.839
So isn't it just as likely that these
juvenile criminals watch violent TV shows

36:11.898 --> 36:14.777
because that's the kind of program
they're likely to be attracted to,

36:14.834 --> 36:16.211
given their personalities?

36:16.469 --> 36:17.846
I'm not sure.

36:18.104 --> 36:20.106
Did you watch
television as a youngster?

36:20.540 --> 36:21.575
Sure.

36:21.774 --> 36:23.685
Did you watch westerns?

36:23.876 --> 36:27.187
Gunsmoke, Have Gun
- Will Travel, Bonanza.

36:28.314 --> 36:33.320
Mr. McCoy, I've discussed this many times.
The violence on those shows

36:33.553 --> 36:37.695
had a moral context, as do violent
scenes in Sophocles and Shakespeare.

36:38.791 --> 36:42.238
I'm not arguing that we must
never see a part of reality

36:42.295 --> 36:45.868
that undoubtedly exists
on television or in movies.

36:46.466 --> 36:50.539
But I am arguing images of
gratuitous violence and sex

36:50.603 --> 36:52.105
debase our culture.

36:53.339 --> 36:55.285
And you decide
what is gratuitous?

36:55.341 --> 36:57.821
A civilized society can
come to agree on that.

36:58.544 --> 37:01.252
Do you believe that
we are a civilized society?

37:01.347 --> 37:02.985
I believe we used to be.

37:03.149 --> 37:06.995
And you think setting
Eddie Chandler free

37:08.154 --> 37:11.692
to prove a political point
would make us more civilized?

37:11.758 --> 37:13.101
PRESSMAN: Objection.

37:14.260 --> 37:16.467
Withdrawn.
No more questions.

37:19.532 --> 37:21.773
When I was a kid,
when I came home from school,

37:21.834 --> 37:25.179
I'd turn the TV on and pretty
much, I guess, watch it

37:25.304 --> 37:27.341
straight on,
right through till bedtime.

37:28.007 --> 37:29.850
PRESSMAN: What kind
of shows did you watch?

37:30.109 --> 37:32.817
Cop shows. Action shows.
The Mod Squad.

37:32.879 --> 37:35.519
The A-Team,
Starsky and Hutch.

37:36.215 --> 37:38.126
I used to pretend
I was one of the characters.

37:39.052 --> 37:40.156
How'd that make you feel?

37:40.219 --> 37:41.254
Alive.

37:42.288 --> 37:46.759
More intense, more real.

37:47.160 --> 37:49.197
Did you ever get into a
fight when you were a kid?

37:49.762 --> 37:54.609
Once, by accident,
I hit a friend in the face

37:54.667 --> 37:57.170
and I broke his nose.

37:58.137 --> 37:59.411
There was blood,
a lot of blood.

37:59.972 --> 38:01.974
How'd that make you feel?

38:02.842 --> 38:03.912
(LAUGHING)

38:04.210 --> 38:05.553
It gave me a rush.

38:07.847 --> 38:12.887
Like seeing David Carradine
beat the bad guys on Kung-Fu.

38:21.928 --> 38:28.903
Did you ever see any explicit
sadomasochistic acts on network television?

38:29.702 --> 38:30.737
No.

38:30.803 --> 38:33.716
Did you ever see anybody
tortured with a knife

38:33.773 --> 38:36.413
and shot in the groin
on primetime television?

38:36.476 --> 38:37.477
No.

38:37.543 --> 38:41.081
So how did you come up with the
idea for torturing Stuart Steiner?

38:43.916 --> 38:45.953
Did you see it on TV?

38:46.085 --> 38:49.089
I don't know, yeah. Maybe.
Yeah, I think I did.

38:49.488 --> 38:50.967
What show?

38:55.761 --> 38:58.264
You never saw it
on TV, did you?

39:01.467 --> 39:03.504
You thought it up on your own?

39:04.370 --> 39:05.371
I don't know.

39:05.471 --> 39:07.747
And you knew you were
breaking the law, didn't you?

39:10.109 --> 39:11.110
No.

39:11.177 --> 39:16.251
And still you murdered
Mr. Steiner and Ms. Gaylin

39:17.250 --> 39:20.356
because you thought
that they deserved to die?

39:24.056 --> 39:26.900
Because you believed
that they were monsters?

39:29.862 --> 39:30.966
Yeah.

39:38.337 --> 39:39.680
No more questions.

39:44.710 --> 39:47.088
If television didn't
influence our behavior,

39:47.146 --> 39:51.253
why would advertisers spend millions of
dollars every year on TV commercials?

39:52.351 --> 39:54.262
Of course,
TV has an effect on us.

39:55.321 --> 39:57.494
You watch,
as I did 30 years ago,

39:57.557 --> 39:59.332
you watch
the Vietnam War on TV,

39:59.392 --> 40:00.735
you are changed.

40:01.627 --> 40:05.575
Now, Mr. McCoy will no doubt tell you that
this is a matter of freedom of speech,

40:06.199 --> 40:07.610
that this is
a First Amendment issue.

40:08.568 --> 40:11.048
It is not. It is about what
you as parents already know.

40:11.237 --> 40:13.945
That your children are
mesmerized when they watch TV.

40:14.006 --> 40:15.144
How they copy what they see.

40:15.207 --> 40:17.619
They act out karate fights
after watching Power Rangers.

40:19.312 --> 40:23.522
And here we have Eddie Chandler
who was abused, exploited

40:23.850 --> 40:26.126
and discarded by people
he thought were his friends.

40:26.218 --> 40:28.289
Eddie Chandler,
who for 30 years,

40:28.354 --> 40:30.766
was bombarded
with televised fantasies

40:30.856 --> 40:35.464
of bloodshed and vengeance and cruelty
that turned him into a violence junkie.

40:35.761 --> 40:39.004
Television told him it's okay to kill.
Television.

40:42.001 --> 40:45.380
Now, the judge will instruct you that
if you find mitigating circumstances,

40:46.205 --> 40:51.177
for example, if my client acted under an
irresistible compulsion to commit violence,

40:52.345 --> 40:55.485
then you can acquit him of
the top count of murder one,

40:55.548 --> 40:58.154
and find him guilty of
first-degree manslaughter.

41:00.319 --> 41:04.267
I am not asking you to
absolve him of all blame,

41:05.658 --> 41:09.071
just the blame
that properly belongs

41:09.128 --> 41:10.971
to those who infected his mind.

41:17.870 --> 41:22.080
JACK: Mr. Pressman is right. This
is not a First Amendment issue.

41:23.409 --> 41:27.653
We can all agree that what we
see powerfully affects us.

41:28.147 --> 41:30.889
But that doesn't excuse us
from being decent human beings

41:31.350 --> 41:34.297
or from making moral choices.

41:36.088 --> 41:37.999
What we choose to watch

41:39.592 --> 41:43.597
and how we react is up to us.

41:48.034 --> 41:49.604
The baby boom generation,

41:49.669 --> 41:52.707
to which Congressman Maxwell
and I both belong,

41:54.473 --> 41:58.615
grew up watching hundreds
of hours of violent TV.

41:58.677 --> 42:00.657
We dressed up
like Davey Crockett

42:00.713 --> 42:02.989
with his trusty rifle,
Old Betsy,

42:03.716 --> 42:07.755
like Hopalong Cassidy, with his
pearl-handled six-shooters.

42:10.723 --> 42:15.468
And what was the result of all this
make-believe, TV-inspired violence?

42:16.028 --> 42:21.535
We grew up to be a generation that
marched against war, and preached peace,

42:21.634 --> 42:24.080
love, and flower power,
and, yes,

42:24.370 --> 42:30.013
Mr. Pressman watched the Vietnam War
on TV, and how did that change him?

42:30.343 --> 42:33.722
I looked up his record. He
became a conscientious objector

42:35.648 --> 42:39.994
and a Harvard Law professor.
Dangerous guy, huh?

42:47.359 --> 42:51.933
We are creatures of free will
and moral choice.

42:53.332 --> 42:56.108
No matter what we see,
read, or hear,

42:57.002 --> 42:59.744
we still make choices.

43:00.473 --> 43:04.512
Eddie Chandler,
a man who murdered

43:04.777 --> 43:07.986
and tortured two
innocent people,

43:10.416 --> 43:12.487
chose evil.

43:22.828 --> 43:24.603
Hello.

43:25.498 --> 43:26.909
Come to offer a plea?

43:26.966 --> 43:29.572
(CHUCKLING) Get a chicken
salad sandwich, actually.

43:29.902 --> 43:32.382
Three days of jury
deliberations don't scare me.

43:33.339 --> 43:36.616
I want to tell you, Jack,
I admire your passion.

43:37.610 --> 43:40.113
I wish I could say
I admired your consistency.

43:43.516 --> 43:46.326
"The founders put freedom of
speech in the First Amendment"

43:46.385 --> 43:49.491
"because they understood
that democracy begins"

43:49.555 --> 43:52.229
"with the most
basic freedom of all,"

43:52.291 --> 43:55.067
"the freedom to think what we
want and to say what we think."

43:58.063 --> 44:00.009
You were a champion
of the First Amendment,

44:01.200 --> 44:02.577
and now you're
arguing for censorship.

44:02.635 --> 44:03.841
Yeah, I wrote that.

44:04.403 --> 44:05.814
And I still believe
in the First Amendment.

44:06.005 --> 44:07.484
And your argument in this case?

44:08.340 --> 44:09.978
I want to see
if the public does, too.

44:17.816 --> 44:21.457
On the first count of the indictment
in the death of Jennifer Gaylin,

44:22.555 --> 44:25.434
murder in the second degree,
how do you find?

44:25.791 --> 44:28.499
We find the defendant,
Edward Chandler, guilty.

44:29.562 --> 44:33.339
On the second count of the indictment
in the death of Stuart Steiner,

44:33.666 --> 44:36.112
murder in the first degree,
how do you find?

44:36.235 --> 44:38.875
We find the defendant,
Edward Chandler, guilty.

44:51.317 --> 44:53.092
Have you seen
the Crimson Law Review?

44:53.152 --> 44:57.100
There's a new article by Pressman on the
viability of TV violence as a defense.

44:57.656 --> 44:59.658
Their lead-time
for articles is three months.

44:59.758 --> 45:02.671
Pressman wrote and submitted this a
month before taking the Chandler case.

45:03.395 --> 45:07.400
I guess he wanted to try out
his defense on a real jury.

45:09.368 --> 45:11.507
This was just a lab
experiment for him.

45:11.637 --> 45:14.618
He got his results, a vote
for personal responsibility.

45:16.475 --> 45:19.752
I'm afraid some other defense lawyer
will take this and get a different vote.

45:21.981 --> 45:23.153
Bedtime reading.

45:23.215 --> 45:24.216
Bathroom.
