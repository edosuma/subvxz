00:38.980 --> 00:41.320
Daisy, put that into the oven.

00:46.140 --> 00:48.130
Ohh!

00:48.180 --> 00:50.650
Have you chosen what you want yet?

00:52.380 --> 00:54.370
Whatever you think best.

00:54.420 --> 00:58.130
That doesn't sound like a bride
on the brink of wedded bliss!

00:58.180 --> 01:01.370
It's a long time since I've
been on the brink of anything.

01:01.420 --> 01:03.410
Except possibly the grave.

01:03.460 --> 01:05.450
I wanted a big wedding breakfast.

01:05.500 --> 01:08.370
All of us sat at groaning
tables having a jolly time.

01:08.420 --> 01:11.490
- Why can't you have that?
- It's not how posh people do it.

01:11.540 --> 01:16.130
They stand about with nibbly bits stuck in
their teeth and that's what we've to do.

01:16.180 --> 01:19.450
I don't see why. We could put
trestle tables up in the hall.

01:19.500 --> 01:22.290
No, Mr Carson wants it like
the family would do it.

01:22.340 --> 01:24.610
(SIGHS) I don't mind.

01:24.660 --> 01:26.650
Not really.

01:26.700 --> 01:29.410
- So what are you going to wear?
- My brown day dress.

01:29.460 --> 01:31.450
Anna is going to tidy it up a bit.

01:31.500 --> 01:33.810
It's simple, but I'm sure it will be fine.

01:33.860 --> 01:38.610
Because I've got a new
catalogue. It's so easy.

01:38.660 --> 01:42.060
You send a postal order and
they send you the dress!

01:42.620 --> 01:44.730
I know what a catalogue is, thank you.

01:44.780 --> 01:48.900
I'm too old to think a new
dress will solve anything much.

01:50.500 --> 01:53.700
Well, you're not wasting
money, that's for sure.

01:59.100 --> 02:01.770
Mama! What are you doing here?

02:01.820 --> 02:03.810
I wasn't expecting you.

02:03.860 --> 02:09.169
I want to be quite certain you're thinking sensibly
about the possible changes at the hospital.

02:09.220 --> 02:12.530
By thinking sensibly, you
mean thinking like you.

02:12.580 --> 02:14.570
Of course.

02:14.620 --> 02:16.610
Cora believes you're wrong.

02:16.660 --> 02:18.650
Cora is confused.

02:18.700 --> 02:21.370
And when she sees sense,
she'll agree with you?

02:21.420 --> 02:23.410
You have been talking to Isobel.

02:23.460 --> 02:26.730
Since they made her the almoner,
she's never been the same.

02:26.780 --> 02:29.970
- I have been talking to Cora.
- That is a mistake.

02:30.020 --> 02:32.810
You can't expect me to avoid
talking to my own wife!

02:32.860 --> 02:37.540
Why not? I know several couples who are
perfectly happy, haven't spoken in years.

02:39.060 --> 02:41.890
Hello, Granny! They
didn't say you were here.

02:41.940 --> 02:45.060
I'm here to make sure of your
father in the coming fight.

02:46.580 --> 02:49.180
I'm off to London to calm my editor.

02:49.740 --> 02:51.730
Say goodbye to Mama.

02:51.780 --> 02:53.570
Will you stay with Rosamund?

02:53.620 --> 02:56.690
I don't know how long I'll be
there. So I'll stay at the flat.

02:56.740 --> 02:59.530
Is it proper for a young
woman to be alone in a flat?

02:59.580 --> 03:03.970
Granny, Adrienne Bolland flew alone
over the Andes mountains four years ago.

03:04.020 --> 03:06.010
Anyway, I'm not a young woman.

03:06.060 --> 03:08.050
I'm staring middle age in the face.

03:08.100 --> 03:10.090
- Granny!
- Have you seen your mama?

03:10.140 --> 03:13.050
She's just finishing off
the menus with Mrs Patmore.

03:13.100 --> 03:15.090
Then I will be off.

03:15.140 --> 03:17.130
Why not stay and say hello?

03:17.180 --> 03:24.130
Oh... I have a feeling Cora and I will be
saying hello rather less than... en garde!

03:24.180 --> 03:26.250
.. in the next few weeks.

03:29.020 --> 03:31.010
Right.

03:31.060 --> 03:33.050
What if we keep the Dover sole

03:33.100 --> 03:36.090
and change the cod to a crown roast?

03:36.140 --> 03:39.050
- I'll do peaches in brandy.
- That sounds more like it.

03:39.100 --> 03:41.090
Thank you, Mrs Patmore.

03:41.140 --> 03:44.010
- Is everything else all right?
- Yes, Your Ladyship.

03:44.060 --> 03:47.730
That is... I'm a bit
concerned about the wedding.

03:47.780 --> 03:51.370
Why is that? Don't hesitate to
charge it all to the house account.

03:51.420 --> 03:53.810
Oh, very kind, I'm sure.
But it's not that.

03:53.860 --> 03:56.370
- Mrs Hughes isn't happy.
- I'm sorry to hear it.

03:56.420 --> 04:00.130
- Is she regretting her decision?
- It's not her decision she regrets

04:00.180 --> 04:02.250
so much as his decision.

04:17.940 --> 04:19.930
What is that?

04:19.980 --> 04:22.650
A stamp to mark the
British Empire exhibition.

04:22.700 --> 04:25.770
Just been released. First
commemorative stamp ever.

04:25.820 --> 04:27.810
What's that great lion doing?

04:27.860 --> 04:30.850
It's the lion of Britain
with the head of the king.

04:30.900 --> 04:33.260
Hm! I think it's silly.

04:34.420 --> 04:36.410
Because you understand nothing.

04:36.460 --> 04:38.450
(BELL)

04:38.500 --> 04:40.500
I'll go.

04:45.180 --> 04:47.180
(VOICES)

04:55.500 --> 04:57.570
- Ahem.
- Who was that?

04:58.700 --> 05:01.500
- Who was... what?
- Whoever was outside.

05:02.820 --> 05:05.130
- Was nobody.
- Very talkative for a nobody.

05:05.180 --> 05:08.420
I meant... He'd come to the wrong house.

05:09.460 --> 05:11.460
Haven't we all?

05:21.060 --> 05:24.490
- Did Lady Edith get off OK?
- As far as I know.

05:24.540 --> 05:28.650
I can't think why she doesn't sack the
wretched man and find someone else.

05:28.700 --> 05:33.090
Unless she enjoys racing up to London
in a swirling cloud of crisis and drama.

05:33.140 --> 05:36.250
I've had rather a sad
letter from Mr Branson.

05:36.300 --> 05:38.290
Listen.

05:38.340 --> 05:41.330
I dreamt last night I was
in the park at Downton,

05:41.380 --> 05:43.690
walking with Sybbie under the great trees,

05:43.740 --> 05:46.650
listening to the pigeons
cooing in their branches.

05:46.700 --> 05:50.130
And when I woke, my eyes
were filled with tears.

05:50.180 --> 05:52.650
- That's very moving.
- I agree.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.690
I owe him a letter.

05:54.740 --> 05:57.210
I'll write after Carson's wedding.

05:57.700 --> 06:01.220
Talking of which, I feel
sorry for Mrs Hughes.

06:02.260 --> 06:04.530
I said I'd brighten up her frock for her.

06:04.580 --> 06:08.290
When she gave it me, it was an old day
dress. There wasn't much I could do.

06:08.340 --> 06:10.330
Can't I lend her a brooch or something?

06:10.380 --> 06:13.650
I told Mrs Patmore and she said not
to worry. Maybe she's got a plan.

06:13.700 --> 06:15.690
Let's hope so.

06:15.740 --> 06:18.740
Have you given any more
thought to Mr Ryder's advice?

06:19.820 --> 06:21.820
I have.

06:23.460 --> 06:25.250
You're not...

06:25.300 --> 06:28.380
- Too early to tell.
- Lord knows the problem isn't Bates!

06:29.500 --> 06:33.570
Honestly, My Lady! If I repeated some
of the things you say downstairs...

06:33.620 --> 06:37.130
Should you be working? I can
manage. And there's always Baxter.

06:37.180 --> 06:39.170
No, Mr Bates would smell a rat.

06:39.220 --> 06:42.810
I don't want him to know anything until
it's worked and I'm almost showing.

06:42.860 --> 06:44.650
He'd put so much on to it.

06:44.700 --> 06:49.170
At the end of the third month, I'll invent
an appointment and we'll whizz up to London!

06:49.220 --> 06:51.530
- How exciting!
- I don't want to be excited.

06:51.580 --> 06:54.250
Not until I know it's going to happen.

06:58.740 --> 07:00.730
Looking for a place, Mr Barrow?

07:00.780 --> 07:02.770
I might be. Would you be sorry?

07:02.820 --> 07:04.810
They've not said anything though.

07:04.860 --> 07:06.850
Mr Carson is hoping I'll resign.

07:06.900 --> 07:09.770
To avoid any possible
unpleasantness, that's all.

07:09.820 --> 07:11.810
What do you think of this?

07:11.860 --> 07:14.570
Experienced manservant required

07:14.620 --> 07:17.930
for a position of trust
in a prominent household.

07:17.980 --> 07:19.770
Sounds interesting. Where is it?

07:19.820 --> 07:22.730
I'm only looking in the Yorkshire
papers. I want to stay up here.

07:22.780 --> 07:26.850
Careful, Mr Barrow. Someone might accuse
you of having feelings for the area.

07:26.900 --> 07:28.890
Would that be so hard to believe?

07:28.940 --> 07:31.810
Harder for you to accept
than for us to believe.

07:31.860 --> 07:34.690
Am I here tonight without cousin Violet

07:34.740 --> 07:36.730
to cement my alliance with Cora?

07:36.780 --> 07:38.770
No, not at all!

07:38.820 --> 07:42.330
Carson, could you ask Mrs Hughes
to join us in the drawing room?

07:42.380 --> 07:44.370
Mrs Hughes, My Lady?

07:44.420 --> 07:47.810
I want to ask her something and
I'd like Lady Mary to be there.

07:47.860 --> 07:50.460
- What are you getting at?
- Carson?

07:50.740 --> 07:52.730
Of course, Your Ladyship.

07:52.780 --> 07:55.650
Shall we go through? Are
you staying tonight, Robert?

07:55.700 --> 07:57.690
No, I don't want to miss anything.

07:57.740 --> 08:00.410
Does cousin Violet know
I'm here this evening?

08:00.460 --> 08:02.250
Not unless you've told her.

08:02.300 --> 08:04.970
I don't want her to think
I'm plotting against her.

08:05.020 --> 08:07.020
- Aren't you?
- Yes.

08:07.900 --> 08:10.170
But I don't want her to know.

08:12.620 --> 08:14.810
Her Ladyship is going to help Mr Mason.

08:14.860 --> 08:18.130
When I was in the drawing room,
she almost said it out loud!

08:18.180 --> 08:19.770
Let's hope so.

08:19.820 --> 08:22.530
Now, will you let me take
you through the exam papers?

08:22.580 --> 08:25.450
- Are you losing confidence in me?
- No, it's not that.

08:25.500 --> 08:27.490
I'm sure you know the answers.

08:27.540 --> 08:30.530
But sometimes it can be hard
to make out the question.

08:30.580 --> 08:33.770
Mr Molesley, shall we ask them
to come down and help themselves?

08:33.820 --> 08:36.090
- Sorry, Mr Carson.
- Is Mrs Hughes in her room?

08:36.140 --> 08:38.140
As far as I know.

08:43.659 --> 08:46.930
- How may I help, My Lady?
- I'm sorry to put you on the spot.

08:46.980 --> 08:50.650
But I believe you've been rather
railroaded over your reception.

08:50.700 --> 08:53.570
I understand you don't want
to be married from this house.

08:53.620 --> 08:55.610
- What?
- Why ever not?

08:55.660 --> 08:58.930
My Lady, we're both honoured
to be allowed the privilege --

08:58.980 --> 09:01.330
No. I want to hear from Mrs Hughes.

09:01.380 --> 09:04.250
Your Ladyship, I have no
wish to sound ungrateful.

09:04.300 --> 09:06.290
This is a fine house.

09:06.340 --> 09:08.330
And Mr Carson's right.

09:08.380 --> 09:10.850
It would be an honour
to hold our party here.

09:10.900 --> 09:12.890
But it's not what you want.

09:12.940 --> 09:18.250
Well, to start with, I'd like a kind of reception
that's different from the ones you're used to.

09:18.300 --> 09:20.690
With a solid meal served at proper tables.

09:20.740 --> 09:23.930
Does anyone have a sit-down
wedding breakfast any more?

09:23.980 --> 09:25.970
A great many people, My Lady.

09:26.020 --> 09:29.850
And then I'd like to feel
we could ask all sorts.

09:29.900 --> 09:32.730
Everyone who's been
part of our lives here.

09:32.780 --> 09:35.010
And I'd planned for music later on.

09:35.060 --> 09:37.050
And maybe a bit of a hoolie.

09:37.100 --> 09:39.890
None of which would be
suitable in the Great Hall.

09:39.940 --> 09:42.450
- It would not.
- There you are, we're agreeing.

09:42.500 --> 09:46.010
Mrs Hughes, doesn't Carson
deserve a wedding in this house?

09:46.060 --> 09:49.410
Where he has served this family
for so long and with such loyalty.

09:49.460 --> 09:52.770
And will continue to do so while
there is breath in his body.

09:52.820 --> 09:54.410
Well, then.

09:54.460 --> 09:56.450
But this is our day, My Lady.

09:56.500 --> 09:59.440
It's about Charles
Carson and Elsie Hughes.

10:00.580 --> 10:04.970
And not about this glorious house or the
glorious people who have lived in it.

10:05.020 --> 10:07.930
Just us, and that's the way
I'd like to celebrate it.

10:07.980 --> 10:10.290
I couldn't understand more, Mrs Hughes.

10:10.340 --> 10:12.330
I hope we'll be invited.

10:12.380 --> 10:14.370
Of course you will all be invited.

10:14.420 --> 10:16.410
We'd be honoured if you come.

10:16.460 --> 10:19.730
But it would be our day,
celebrated in our way.

10:19.780 --> 10:22.450
Do you know where you
will stage this festivity?

10:22.500 --> 10:25.010
I had thought about the
schoolhouse, My Lord.

10:25.060 --> 10:27.050
But Mr Carson doesn't care for it.

10:27.100 --> 10:29.090
I don't mind the schoolhouse.

10:29.140 --> 10:31.610
Right, then it would seem to be settled.

10:31.660 --> 10:33.650
Thank you, Mrs Hughes.

10:33.700 --> 10:35.700
Thank you, My Lady.

10:40.860 --> 10:44.170
- Why did we have to listen to that?!
- I want you to stop bullying them.

10:44.220 --> 10:46.610
- And let them do it their way.
- You think I'm a bully?

10:46.660 --> 10:49.250
- I think you're a snob.
- How do you make that out?

10:49.300 --> 10:52.370
She didn't want the bother of a
servants' wedding in the hall.

10:52.420 --> 10:54.410
That's not fair. We...

10:54.460 --> 10:56.460
Ahem.

11:09.100 --> 11:11.100
Going out, Mr Spratt?

11:13.180 --> 11:15.170
Do I have your permission?

11:15.220 --> 11:18.010
You can go round the world
as far as I'm concerned.

11:18.060 --> 11:21.660
That's very considerate of you.
But a breath of air is all I need.

11:31.420 --> 11:33.420
(KNOCKING)

11:34.660 --> 11:38.570
Denker, I wonder if I might have
something warm to drink before I go up.

11:38.620 --> 11:40.610
Yes, certainly, My Lady.

11:40.660 --> 11:42.770
How about a nice cup of hot chocolate?

11:42.820 --> 11:45.160
Oh, just the thing. Thank you.

11:48.180 --> 11:50.170
- Um...
- Yes?

11:50.220 --> 11:54.050
My Lady, Mr Spratt seems very
preoccupied at the moment.

11:54.100 --> 11:56.370
I wondered if you knew what it was about.

11:56.420 --> 11:59.530
Does this spring from a
concern for his welfare?

11:59.580 --> 12:01.970
We all have to rub along
together, don't we?

12:02.020 --> 12:04.250
Well, it would be nice if we could.

12:04.300 --> 12:07.930
I worry. Perhaps one of
his friends is in trouble.

12:07.980 --> 12:11.010
I know nothing of Spratt's friends.

12:11.060 --> 12:13.050
I know he has a great many relations

12:13.100 --> 12:17.290
who seem to get married and
buried with numbing regularity.

12:17.340 --> 12:19.330
Usually on very inconvenient days.

12:19.380 --> 12:21.370
Perhaps it's one of them?

12:21.420 --> 12:23.420
Why don't you ask him?

12:24.980 --> 12:27.450
While you're making my chocolate.

12:27.940 --> 12:30.140
Yes, My Lady. Of course.

12:40.540 --> 12:42.930
Oh, My Lord. A quick word.

12:42.980 --> 12:47.170
It may be that we have a painless
solution to the problem of Barrow.

12:47.220 --> 12:48.610
Oh, yes?

12:48.660 --> 12:50.930
He's applying for a job in the vicinity.

12:50.980 --> 12:54.130
Do you know of a house
called Dryden Park, near York?

12:54.180 --> 12:56.970
The name rings a bell. I think
my parents used to go there.

12:57.020 --> 13:00.490
But I haven't heard anything about it
for years. Is that where he's off to?

13:00.540 --> 13:03.050
- Hopefully. We shall see.
- Ahem.

13:03.100 --> 13:05.570
- Are you quite well?
- Oh, yes.

13:06.540 --> 13:08.680
Just a bit of indigestion.

13:10.060 --> 13:12.050
Carson.

13:12.100 --> 13:15.770
I hope you weren't upset by that
business in the drawing room.

13:15.820 --> 13:22.130
Not at all, My Lady. As a matter
of fact, I don't believe Her Ladyship
was acting for snobbish reasons.

13:22.180 --> 13:26.530
Perhaps not. But it annoys me to see
you cheated of your just desserts.

13:26.580 --> 13:29.850
- I wanted the best for you.
- And I shall have it, My Lady.

13:29.900 --> 13:33.020
If you attend the wedding,
that's enough for me.

13:34.420 --> 13:36.420
Good night.

13:48.060 --> 13:50.060
(BELL)

13:58.180 --> 14:00.170
- Yes?
- Hello.

14:00.220 --> 14:03.410
I telephoned earlier in
response to the advertisement.

14:03.460 --> 14:05.450
- Name's Barrow.
- Come in.

14:05.500 --> 14:07.570
- Come in.
- Thank you.

14:12.260 --> 14:14.250
Lady Edith Crawley?

14:14.300 --> 14:16.450
- It is you, isn't it?
- Hello...

14:16.500 --> 14:19.890
Bertie Pelham. We met at Brancaster
when it was let to Lord Sinderby.

14:19.940 --> 14:23.970
Of course! I'm sorry to be so
dense. I remember you very well.

14:24.020 --> 14:26.010
You're the agent. Or you were then.

14:26.060 --> 14:29.530
I am now. Business has brought
me to London for a few days.

14:29.580 --> 14:31.170
Me too.

14:31.220 --> 14:35.530
In fact, it's the longest time I've
spent in London since my cousin came out.

14:35.580 --> 14:37.970
She was with us at
Brancaster. Rose Aldridge.

14:38.020 --> 14:40.810
I remember. I thought you
were a very jolly party.

14:40.860 --> 14:44.850
I told Lord Hexham he should try and
let to the Sinderbys again this year!

14:44.900 --> 14:46.890
Are you having a good time in London?

14:46.940 --> 14:49.250
Well, I've been working since I arrived.

14:49.300 --> 14:51.770
- And missing Marigold, of course.
- Marigold?

14:51.820 --> 14:54.490
My... That is, my ward.

14:54.540 --> 14:56.530
- Our ward.
- Of course.

14:56.580 --> 14:58.570
You told me about her.

14:58.620 --> 15:00.890
- I'd better get on.
- I expect you're busy.

15:00.940 --> 15:05.290
I'm not usually, but I've got rather
a drama on my hands with my magazine.

15:05.340 --> 15:08.410
You've probably forgotten,
but I own a magazine.

15:08.460 --> 15:11.530
Indeed I have not. I thought
it was incredibly modern.

15:11.580 --> 15:14.090
It's incredibly complicated at the moment.

15:14.140 --> 15:16.610
Which is why I have to
get back to the office.

15:16.660 --> 15:19.450
I don't suppose you'd like
a drink with me later on.

15:19.500 --> 15:21.690
- Well...
- Only I'm going home tomorrow.

15:21.740 --> 15:23.730
And I'm not sure when I'll be back.

15:23.780 --> 15:26.410
All right. Why not?

15:26.460 --> 15:28.570
But it will have to be near the office.

15:28.620 --> 15:30.610
We're in Covent Garden.

15:30.660 --> 15:33.370
What about Rules? Will they
let us have a drink there?

15:33.420 --> 15:35.530
I should think so. Shall we say seven?

15:35.580 --> 15:38.980
I'm going to hurry away
before you change your mind!

15:41.300 --> 15:44.610
Perhaps you could tell me a
little more about the job, Mr...

15:44.660 --> 15:48.130
Reresby. Sir Michael Reresby.

15:48.180 --> 15:50.170
Oh.

15:50.220 --> 15:54.010
As you can see, we've
rather let things slide.

15:54.060 --> 15:57.000
It's been very difficult
since my wife died.

15:58.420 --> 16:00.620
I can imagine, Sir Michael.

16:02.140 --> 16:04.880
She was a lady in waiting, do you know?

16:05.460 --> 16:08.200
- To the old Duchess of Connaught. - Ah.

16:08.700 --> 16:10.690
Do you have any other family?

16:10.740 --> 16:12.740
Two sons.

16:13.900 --> 16:16.900
But they... They never
came back from the war.

16:18.940 --> 16:21.010
Very sorry to hear that.

16:23.380 --> 16:26.290
- Did you serve?
- I was in Flanders, yes.

16:26.340 --> 16:29.060
I served. I got this there.

16:30.660 --> 16:36.180
That's what I need. Someone who knows about
fighting for his king and his country.

16:43.940 --> 16:46.930
I expect this was a wonderful
house for entertaining.

16:46.980 --> 16:48.970
Oh, you should have seen it!

16:49.020 --> 16:51.010
We had such fun in those days.

16:51.060 --> 16:53.060
(SIGHS)

16:54.300 --> 16:57.100
Do you know what I shall always remember?

16:57.580 --> 17:02.460
The women going up to bed
at the end of the evening.

17:05.140 --> 17:09.140
Their faces lit by the
flame from the candle.

17:11.060 --> 17:14.210
Yes, diamonds twinkling

17:14.260 --> 17:17.900
as they climbed up into the darkness.

17:26.339 --> 17:28.410
Shall we go through here?

17:30.940 --> 17:34.890
As you can see, it's all rather silted up.

17:34.940 --> 17:37.610
- Can you clear a space?
- Of course.

17:39.420 --> 17:42.610
So can you let me know more about the job?

17:42.660 --> 17:44.860
How many staff do you have?

17:45.780 --> 17:50.330
Well, there's Mrs Tonkins. She
comes in three days a week.

17:50.380 --> 17:53.090
And she has to manage everything?

17:53.140 --> 17:56.080
We do have a man outside
every now and then.

17:56.620 --> 17:58.410
But that's why we need you.

17:58.460 --> 18:04.180
In your advertisement, you spoke of a position
of trust, Sir Michael, in a prominent household.

18:05.220 --> 18:08.850
This is a very prominent household.

18:08.900 --> 18:10.890
Can you doubt it?

18:10.940 --> 18:13.930
We have entertained not
just the Connaughts,

18:13.980 --> 18:16.570
but the Fife princesses!

18:16.620 --> 18:21.490
Both of them. The Duke of
Argyll. The Queen of Spain.

18:21.540 --> 18:24.530
Yes... But that was some time ago.

18:24.580 --> 18:26.570
Are you a republican?

18:26.620 --> 18:30.730
No. I don't believe so, but then I've
never really thought about it much.

18:30.780 --> 18:32.770
Well, think about it now!

18:32.820 --> 18:36.530
I can't risk a republican in this
household when anyone might call!

18:36.580 --> 18:40.170
Maybe you're right. Maybe
I'm not quite up to it.

18:40.220 --> 18:42.210
Philosophically.

18:42.260 --> 18:45.890
Thank heavens we picked that
up before he caused any trouble!

18:45.940 --> 18:47.940
I should be going.

18:50.220 --> 18:52.610
I hope you find the man
you're looking for.

18:52.660 --> 18:55.170
We can't let them down, do you see?

18:55.220 --> 18:59.260
When the good times return,
they will all come back.

19:00.460 --> 19:02.450
We must be ready.

19:02.500 --> 19:04.850
Can't let our standards slip.

19:04.900 --> 19:06.890
No.

19:06.940 --> 19:09.480
And good luck with those standards.

19:15.100 --> 19:17.410
This is what you had
in mind for the cover?

19:17.460 --> 19:19.050
No, don't touch that!

19:19.100 --> 19:21.890
It does seem similar to
last month's, Mr Skinner.

19:21.940 --> 19:23.930
Don't be so absurd. Please!

19:23.980 --> 19:25.970
Where is the copy for this?

19:26.020 --> 19:28.330
Mr Skinner, this really isn't finished.

19:28.380 --> 19:30.370
I have dealt with amateurism.

19:30.420 --> 19:32.410
I've even dealt with incompetence.

19:32.460 --> 19:35.730
But this ridiculous, muddle-headed
meddling just about --

19:35.780 --> 19:37.770
Mr Skinner! That's quite enough.

19:37.820 --> 19:41.500
If that's how you feel, I suggest
we part company once and for all.

20:00.740 --> 20:02.730
I've done it. He's gone.

20:02.780 --> 20:04.770
Good riddance.

20:04.820 --> 20:06.810
And well done.

20:06.860 --> 20:08.850
But what happens now?

20:08.900 --> 20:10.890
We have to get it out by tomorrow.

20:10.940 --> 20:13.610
We have to get the proofs
to the printers by 4am.

20:13.660 --> 20:15.970
- You can't mean to do it yourself.
- Why not?

20:16.020 --> 20:20.650
I refuse to be defeated by a
petulant and overweight tyrant.

20:20.700 --> 20:22.690
I'll lay out the articles as usual.

20:22.740 --> 20:24.730
It's seven o'clock.

20:24.780 --> 20:26.770
Which means we have nine hours.

20:26.820 --> 20:28.890
We'd better get some coffee on and...

20:28.940 --> 20:30.930
Oh, crikey!

20:30.980 --> 20:32.970
I won't be long.

20:33.020 --> 20:35.360
Keep getting the copy together.

20:42.620 --> 20:45.560
- May I help you, madam?
- I won't be long.

20:52.780 --> 20:57.490
I'm so, so sorry. Believe me, if you knew
what I'm living through, you'd forgive me.

20:57.540 --> 20:59.970
- I forgive you anyway.
- I can't have a drink.

21:00.020 --> 21:02.010
I'd love to, but I can't.

21:02.060 --> 21:04.050
My editor has walked out.

21:04.100 --> 21:07.610
I have to get the magazine to the
printers by four in the morning.

21:07.660 --> 21:10.530
So it's sandwiches and
coffee and work until dawn.

21:10.580 --> 21:12.850
- All right.
- You're a darling. Thank you.

21:12.900 --> 21:15.890
Do telephone me if and when
you're up in London again.

21:15.940 --> 21:18.250
No, I meant all right, I'll come with you.

21:18.300 --> 21:20.890
- Come with me where?
- Back to the office.

21:20.940 --> 21:23.330
I can make coffee. I can fetch sandwiches.

21:23.380 --> 21:26.420
I can... carry bits of paper around.

21:27.860 --> 21:31.330
- Shouldn't we get going?
- Aren't you having dinner somewhere?

21:31.380 --> 21:33.770
I thought that's why
you hadn't suggested it.

21:33.820 --> 21:38.730
No, I didn't think you'd accept dinner. I
planned to ask you halfway through the drink.

21:38.780 --> 21:41.180
Right, well, we should get back.

21:43.620 --> 21:45.610
So it's just the causes of the war.

21:45.660 --> 21:47.650
Both wars.

21:47.700 --> 21:52.170
The Spanish succession and the Austrian
succession. You're comparing them.

21:52.220 --> 21:55.610
Don't forget. Keep it
simple and straightforward.

21:55.660 --> 21:57.660
What is it?

21:58.940 --> 22:00.930
Oh...

22:00.980 --> 22:02.970
I don't know if I should tell you.

22:03.020 --> 22:05.530
Tell me if it's important.
Don't if it's not.

22:05.580 --> 22:07.580
It might be.

22:09.220 --> 22:11.330
When I was serving tea in the library,

22:11.380 --> 22:15.130
I heard them say that the Drewes
are giving up Yew Tree Farm.

22:15.180 --> 22:17.170
That's what she was thinking!

22:17.220 --> 22:19.810
Her Ladyship knew they were
going to hand in the lease.

22:19.860 --> 22:22.050
She couldn't decide
whether to say anything!

22:22.100 --> 22:25.090
- Don't jump the gun.
- I knew she'd had an idea. I said it!

22:25.140 --> 22:28.610
You've made me so happy! This is
just the tonic Mr Mason needs.

22:28.660 --> 22:32.050
- But it's not definite yet.
- I'll say that. I'll tell him that.

22:32.100 --> 22:34.100
But he'll be made up.

22:35.300 --> 22:37.290
(BELL)

22:37.340 --> 22:39.330
Who's that?

22:39.380 --> 22:41.370
Somebody at the back door.

22:41.420 --> 22:44.930
Never mind. Mrs Porter can answer
it. It's probably a delivery.

22:44.980 --> 22:46.980
At this time?

22:51.060 --> 22:53.050
Mr Willis, what brings you here?

22:53.100 --> 22:55.090
I'm sorry to call so late.

22:55.140 --> 22:58.080
But I've had an enquiry
which concerns you.

22:59.020 --> 23:01.010
Mm, I'm all ears!

23:01.060 --> 23:03.800
Mr Spratt, do you know a Mr Wally Stern?

23:04.820 --> 23:06.810
Yes, he's my sister's son.

23:06.860 --> 23:09.050
He's been serving time in York prison.

23:09.100 --> 23:10.690
Oh.

23:10.740 --> 23:14.010
Is it absolutely necessary
for Miss Denker to be present?

23:14.060 --> 23:16.170
- Killjoy.
- She'll be questioned next.

23:16.220 --> 23:18.410
So what's the point in
asking her to leave?

23:18.460 --> 23:20.050
Thank you, Sergeant.

23:20.100 --> 23:23.490
I'm aware of the present situation
of my unfortunate nephew.

23:23.540 --> 23:25.810
Not the present situation, I'm afraid.

23:25.860 --> 23:28.250
Mr Stern recently absconded from prison.

23:28.300 --> 23:30.290
He's currently on the run.

23:30.340 --> 23:34.010
Someone answering his description
has been seen in this neighbourhood.

23:34.060 --> 23:36.730
Naturally, we wondered if
he'd tried to make contact.

23:36.780 --> 23:38.770
Not with me, Sergeant, no.

23:38.820 --> 23:41.290
Miss Denker, can you add anything?

23:43.460 --> 23:44.650
No.

23:44.700 --> 23:47.810
Nothing that leads you to suppose
a man was hanging around the house?

23:47.860 --> 23:49.850
I'm afraid not, Sergeant.

23:49.900 --> 23:52.370
Perhaps the identification was a mistake.

23:52.420 --> 23:54.410
Is he very distinctive to look at?

23:54.460 --> 23:58.820
Um... Not very. Quite ordinary, in fact.

24:00.060 --> 24:02.050
All right.

24:02.100 --> 24:04.090
Well, that would seem to be that.

24:04.140 --> 24:06.130
I'll say goodbye.

24:06.180 --> 24:08.450
Of course, if he tries to get in touch...

24:08.500 --> 24:10.840
We'll be on to you in a moment.

24:17.180 --> 24:20.290
I'm sorry. I don't know why
he wanted to drag you into it.

24:20.340 --> 24:23.450
What an interesting family
you have, Mr Spratt.

24:23.500 --> 24:25.810
Mine are quite dull by comparison.

24:25.860 --> 24:28.130
I haven't seen him for years.

24:29.020 --> 24:31.010
It's your sister I feel sorry for.

24:31.060 --> 24:34.060
- She has done nothing to deserve it.
- Of course not.

24:35.380 --> 24:37.370
I do have one question though.

24:37.420 --> 24:39.410
What's that?

24:39.460 --> 24:41.730
After you put him up in the potting shed,

24:41.780 --> 24:43.780
did he get away safely?

24:50.000 --> 24:52.750
- What's the idea?
- Lady Eltham's costume ball.

24:52.800 --> 24:55.710
I can't decide which guests
are the most important.

24:55.760 --> 24:58.670
Never mind that. Best
clothes and prettiest faces.

24:58.720 --> 25:01.190
Nobody cares about anything else.

25:35.720 --> 25:37.910
You have the address.
They're waiting for you.

25:37.960 --> 25:39.950
He's got everything he needs.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.310
- Put it into Mr Brent's hands.
- Yes, ma'am.

25:42.360 --> 25:45.360
- I'll get you some more coffee.
- Would you?

25:51.320 --> 25:53.830
- Well, you did it.
- We did it.

25:53.880 --> 25:56.160
I really am so grateful.

25:57.120 --> 25:59.110
Are you an editor now?

25:59.160 --> 26:02.750
Does this count in your profession
as a sort of baptism of blood?

26:02.800 --> 26:04.790
I don't know what will happen next.

26:04.840 --> 26:07.390
But it's nice to know I
can do it if I have to.

26:07.440 --> 26:09.430
You certainly can.

26:09.480 --> 26:11.590
I won't though. Not yet.

26:11.640 --> 26:14.350
I'll put someone in charge as a caretaker.

26:14.400 --> 26:16.400
Then I'll think.

26:17.400 --> 26:21.310
In the end, the question must be
are you a country woman or a townie?

26:21.360 --> 26:23.350
It's more than that.

26:23.400 --> 26:25.710
I know now I need a purpose.

26:25.760 --> 26:27.790
That's what I've learned.

26:27.840 --> 26:31.670
I can't just lead one of
those purposeless lives.

26:31.720 --> 26:33.710
You inspire me.

26:33.760 --> 26:35.750
Not many people would say that.

26:35.800 --> 26:38.000
They would if they knew you.

26:42.880 --> 26:44.880
Thank you, Audrey.

26:48.480 --> 26:50.470
So you go home today.

26:50.520 --> 26:54.110
Yes. I'll catch the twelve o'clock
and try and sleep on the train!

26:54.160 --> 26:56.150
What about you?

26:56.200 --> 26:59.700
I'll settle in the new
editor and go back after that.

27:00.080 --> 27:02.550
Our butler is getting married on Saturday.

27:02.600 --> 27:05.870
- Which is quite a big thing.
- Has he been with you a long time?

27:05.920 --> 27:09.670
Forever. He joined us as a junior
footman in my grandfather's day.

27:09.720 --> 27:11.710
I love those stories.

27:11.760 --> 27:14.430
I wonder how much longer
people will tell them.

27:14.480 --> 27:16.470
I know.

27:16.520 --> 27:18.720
Let's not be sad, not today.

27:19.600 --> 27:22.340
After all, we've just edited a magazine.

27:25.840 --> 27:27.830
This just came for you.

27:27.880 --> 27:30.070
- Oh, thank you very much.
- What is it?

27:30.120 --> 27:32.120
Never you mind.

27:34.200 --> 27:37.310
Oh, what a relief! I thought
it wasn't going to get here.

27:37.360 --> 27:38.870
May we know what it is?

27:38.920 --> 27:41.590
It's a frock I ordered as
a surprise for Mrs Hughes.

27:41.640 --> 27:44.430
But with the wedding tomorrow,
I thought we'd missed it.

27:44.480 --> 27:46.550
- Can we have a look?
- Don't see why not.

27:46.600 --> 27:49.710
- Just check Mr Carson's gone.
- It's a relief to me as well.

27:49.760 --> 27:51.830
The one she wanted to wear was awful.

27:51.880 --> 27:53.870
Oh.

27:53.920 --> 27:55.910
Well, it's very...

27:55.960 --> 27:58.550
It's an improvement, we can say that.

27:58.600 --> 28:00.590
Is it? What was the last one like?!

28:00.640 --> 28:03.430
I don't understand. It was
so nice in the picture.

28:03.480 --> 28:06.790
It wasn't dear but... It
seemed like a bargain.

28:06.840 --> 28:08.830
It's the thought that counts.

28:08.880 --> 28:10.870
Not with a frock, it's not!

28:10.920 --> 28:13.510
Lady Mary says she'll lend
her a brooch or something.

28:13.560 --> 28:17.150
A brooch? She'll need a diamond
parure to make this look any good.

28:17.200 --> 28:19.200
She's coming!

28:22.160 --> 28:25.680
Daisy, I'm afraid Gertie's ill,
so can I ask you to do the fires?

28:33.040 --> 28:35.030
I'm sorry to get you up so early.

28:35.080 --> 28:37.070
That's all right, My Lady.

28:37.120 --> 28:39.510
Are you sure you don't want any breakfast?

28:39.560 --> 28:42.360
No. I've had a cup of tea. That's enough.

28:43.240 --> 28:46.240
I'm having luncheon in York
after I see the hospital.

28:52.720 --> 28:56.270
Daisy, you don't do the bedroom
fires these days, do you?

28:56.320 --> 28:58.310
Not as a rule, My Lady, no.

28:58.360 --> 29:02.270
But Gertie's unwell. And we don't
have a proper scullery maid any more.

29:02.320 --> 29:05.390
I'm afraid I'm not usually
up early enough to know that.

29:05.440 --> 29:08.630
I just wanted to say how
very grateful I am, My Lady.

29:08.680 --> 29:11.190
- Grateful? For what?
- When you said you had a plan.

29:11.240 --> 29:14.510
It was because the Drewes might be
leaving Yew Tree Farm, wasn't it?

29:14.560 --> 29:16.750
- Well...
- I know you can't say anything.

29:16.800 --> 29:18.910
But I'm so thankful to you for trying.

29:18.960 --> 29:21.430
Is something the matter, My Lady?

29:23.400 --> 29:25.870
- I hope she wasn't bothering you.
- No, but...

29:25.920 --> 29:27.910
Never mind.

29:27.960 --> 29:29.960
We'll see what happens.

29:32.400 --> 29:37.070
Do you remember I thought Mrs Patmore might
have an idea about Mrs Hughes's dress?

29:37.120 --> 29:39.350
She did, and it arrived this morning.

29:39.400 --> 29:41.390
- No good?
- No good at all.

29:41.440 --> 29:44.950
Horrible, in fact. And it's too
late now to order anything else.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.990
Can't we lend her a dress?

29:47.040 --> 29:49.230
She wouldn't fit into a dress of yours.

29:49.280 --> 29:52.590
- And Her Ladyship is too tall.
- An embroidered evening coat?

29:52.640 --> 29:54.630
The length wouldn't matter so much.

29:54.680 --> 29:56.470
I'll ask Mama when I get up.

29:56.520 --> 29:59.310
Miss Baxter said she was
leaving early to go into York.

29:59.360 --> 30:01.350
That's right. She's out all day.

30:01.400 --> 30:04.670
She goes straight from York
to a meeting with Dr Clarkson.

30:04.720 --> 30:08.520
We'll have to manage without her.
She won't mind. She'll be pleased.

30:13.880 --> 30:15.870
I um...

30:15.920 --> 30:19.880
.. just want to make sure
everything is under control.

30:20.840 --> 30:24.750
I think so. Mr Brock is bringing the
flowers and foliage in the morning.

30:24.800 --> 30:27.400
And Mrs Patmore is on top of things.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.990
Are you nervous?

30:31.040 --> 30:34.470
A little. And I'm sad about my dress.

30:34.520 --> 30:37.150
I wish I'd made more of an effort.

30:37.200 --> 30:39.190
But it's too late now.

30:39.240 --> 30:41.230
I'm sure you'll look wonderful.

30:41.280 --> 30:43.670
- Well, I'll look tidy.
- What about tonight?

30:43.720 --> 30:46.510
We mustn't see each other tonight.

30:46.560 --> 30:48.550
I'm having dinner in here.

30:48.600 --> 30:52.480
And they'll warn you when I'm going
up so we don't meet on the stairs!

30:57.080 --> 30:59.070
Am I hearing right?

30:59.120 --> 31:02.190
You went behind our backs and
betrayed us to the enemy?

31:02.240 --> 31:04.350
Whose enemy? They're not my enemy.

31:04.400 --> 31:06.950
I asked to see the Royal Yorkshire.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.110
And to meet with the doctors in charge

31:09.160 --> 31:11.470
so I could learn the benefits of a merger.

31:11.520 --> 31:14.230
Today, they were good enough to
give me a tour and a luncheon.

31:14.280 --> 31:17.230
- Am I to think ill of them for that?
- And you don't call that betrayal?

31:17.280 --> 31:19.350
It's called being in
possession of the facts.

31:19.400 --> 31:21.390
I wondered when we'd hear from you.

31:21.440 --> 31:25.630
It's unfortunate if you've given them the
impression that we approve of the plan.

31:25.680 --> 31:27.670
But I do approve of it.

31:27.720 --> 31:30.230
And you're the fount
of wisdom on this topic!

31:30.280 --> 31:32.390
I don't claim to know
more than any of you.

31:32.440 --> 31:35.830
I'm glad you don't claim to know
more than I do, Lady Grantham.

31:35.880 --> 31:38.070
- But I am disappointed.
- And we know why.

31:38.120 --> 31:40.110
If we don't, I gather we will soon.

31:40.160 --> 31:44.150
I'm afraid you see the new arrangement
as diminishing your own importance.

31:44.200 --> 31:46.270
- What?
- You're the king of this place.

31:46.320 --> 31:50.590
But once it's a wing of the Royal
Yorkshire, you'll be one more local doctor.

31:50.640 --> 31:53.640
With some authority, yes.
But it will not be the same.

31:56.760 --> 31:59.630
- Mrs Crawley doesn't mean that.
- I'd like to think that.

31:59.680 --> 32:01.790
But it sounds very much as if she does.

32:01.840 --> 32:03.830
Did you drink at luncheon?

32:03.880 --> 32:07.350
No, I did not. Which you know
very well since we were together.

32:07.400 --> 32:09.390
Not all the time.

32:09.440 --> 32:12.510
Shall we call a halt to this
before we say things we will regret?

32:12.560 --> 32:15.870
I rather hope Mrs Crawley
regrets what she's said already.

32:15.920 --> 32:17.910
I'm going home.

32:17.960 --> 32:21.550
In future, let's try to manage
things in a more civilised manner.

32:21.600 --> 32:23.590
Goodbye, Dr Clarkson.

32:23.640 --> 32:25.640
Goodbye, Lady Grantham.

32:31.880 --> 32:33.870
Has tea gone up?

32:33.920 --> 32:35.910
Not yet, oh great one.

32:35.960 --> 32:39.030
How did you get on at Dryden Park?

32:39.080 --> 32:41.470
It wasn't right for me, Mr Carson.

32:41.520 --> 32:45.240
Pity. Mr Molesley, Andrew, tea.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.870
- Won't be long now.
- Something will turn up.

32:49.920 --> 32:52.430
I expect you will be glad
to see the back of me.

32:52.480 --> 32:54.480
If it's what you want.

32:56.360 --> 32:58.630
- He means it too.
- Don't fish.

32:58.680 --> 33:01.150
Especially where they're
never going to bite.

33:01.200 --> 33:03.310
- You've got me wrong.
You all have. - How?

33:03.360 --> 33:06.070
I don't want anything
from Andy but friendship.

33:06.120 --> 33:10.230
We were friends when he first came. I
helped to get him the job, for God's sake!

33:10.280 --> 33:12.790
But now you've all poisoned
his mind against me.

33:12.840 --> 33:14.830
- Then tell him.
- It's too late.

33:14.880 --> 33:16.950
The damage has been done.

33:18.280 --> 33:20.480
You don't believe me anyway.

33:26.320 --> 33:28.310
Mrs Hughes.

33:28.360 --> 33:31.150
Can you pop up to Her
Ladyship's room for a moment?

33:31.200 --> 33:34.190
- Whatever for?
- Lady Mary has a surprise for you.

33:34.240 --> 33:36.750
A surprise? For me?

33:36.800 --> 33:38.790
Why?

33:38.840 --> 33:42.950
You're getting married tomorrow. That
might have something to do with it.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.140
Can we meet there at five?

33:49.600 --> 33:51.590
Here she is, the famous editor!

33:51.640 --> 33:53.980
Trailing streamers of success.

33:55.720 --> 33:57.710
This is the mock-up.

33:57.760 --> 34:00.270
It does seem weird that
we managed it in time.

34:00.320 --> 34:02.310
We managed it?

34:02.360 --> 34:04.350
The office. We all pulled together.

34:04.400 --> 34:07.480
I think it's perfectly
brilliant, darling. Don't you?

34:08.400 --> 34:11.190
I'm back, but I'm going
upstairs to get straight.

34:11.239 --> 34:13.630
- And to calm down.
- Why? How was your day?

34:13.679 --> 34:17.239
The morning was interesting.
The afternoon was ghastly.

34:18.800 --> 34:20.870
Oh, Mama, you'll find...

34:23.080 --> 34:25.070
See? That dress doesn't look bad now

34:25.120 --> 34:28.270
as a foil to set off the
colours of the embroidery.

34:28.320 --> 34:30.310
I agree. It's plainness is a virtue.

34:30.360 --> 34:33.659
And I'm sure we can do
something about the length.

34:35.440 --> 34:38.510
Excuse me? Will someone
explain to me what's going on?

34:38.560 --> 34:41.230
- Didn't Lady Mary tell you, My Lady?
- Tell me what?

34:41.280 --> 34:44.590
That Mrs Hughes is going to borrow
one of your coats to be married in.

34:44.639 --> 34:47.510
Was I to have any say in this as
you rifle through my cupboards?

34:47.560 --> 34:50.350
Your Ladyship, there's obviously
been a misunderstanding.

34:50.400 --> 34:52.389
I'm surprised at you, Mrs Hughes.

34:52.440 --> 34:55.510
This is not the kind of behaviour
I would look for from you.

34:55.560 --> 34:58.550
We'll hang them up at once
and leave you in peace.

34:58.600 --> 35:00.590
Lady Mary said --

35:00.640 --> 35:03.310
Lady Mary may dispose of her
own clothes as she sees fit.

35:03.360 --> 35:06.270
But I do not know what gives her
the right to dispose of mine.

35:06.320 --> 35:09.600
Now please leave me. I have a
headache and I need to lie down.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.990
- You're very prompt.
- Oh, My Lady.

35:19.040 --> 35:21.030
We've had an awful business.

35:21.080 --> 35:24.190
Her Ladyship walked in when Mrs
Hughes was trying on the coats.

35:24.240 --> 35:27.670
I don't know. She seemed to
think we were stealing them.

35:27.720 --> 35:29.710
- Don't be silly.
- I'm not.

35:29.760 --> 35:33.270
I've never seen her so angry.
Poor Mrs Hughes. She feels awful.

35:33.320 --> 35:36.840
We can't have that on the day
before her wedding. Leave it to me.

35:41.720 --> 35:43.720
- (KNOCKING)
- Yes?

35:46.280 --> 35:50.670
I hope Anna's wrong, but she seems to
think you wouldn't lend Mrs Hughes a coat.

35:50.720 --> 35:53.630
I just walked in and they
were putting on my clothes.

35:53.680 --> 35:55.670
Please tell me you weren't rude.

35:55.720 --> 35:59.750
Your mother has had a horrible afternoon with
Granny. They were at each other's throats.

35:59.800 --> 36:03.390
Does that excuse insulting a woman who
has served us faithfully for many years,

36:03.440 --> 36:05.750
who simply wanted something
nice to be married in?

36:05.800 --> 36:08.800
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I tried to but you stormed off.

36:10.080 --> 36:12.070
What was Mrs Hughes doing in there?

36:12.120 --> 36:14.110
Typical though, isn't it?

36:14.160 --> 36:19.550
30 years of service, one wrong move,
and... snap, you're out on your ear.

36:19.600 --> 36:22.070
They're very appreciative of our service.

36:22.120 --> 36:24.910
It was not a wrong move and
she is not out on her ear.

36:24.960 --> 36:26.950
I won't speak ill of Her Ladyship.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.310
Not when she's doing what
she's doing for Mr Mason.

36:29.360 --> 36:31.350
- What's this?
- Daisy.

36:31.400 --> 36:34.990
- You must talk when it isn't settled.
- I want to get things settled.

36:35.040 --> 36:37.030
Don't we all?

36:37.080 --> 36:40.790
You seem unusually disenchanted
with life these days, Mr Barrow.

36:40.840 --> 36:43.310
I can't see the future, Mr Carson.

36:44.360 --> 36:46.960
But then, I suppose, none of us can.

36:51.800 --> 36:53.790
Don't let it upset you.

36:53.840 --> 36:55.840
It does upset me.

36:57.080 --> 37:00.680
I felt like a naughty
child in need of a smack.

37:02.560 --> 37:05.830
Anyway, I'm going up now. It's past ten.

37:05.880 --> 37:08.440
- (KNOCKING)
- Yes?

37:11.840 --> 37:14.040
- May I come in?
- Please.

37:20.760 --> 37:23.030
Mrs Hughes, I won't beat about the bush.

37:23.080 --> 37:25.070
I behaved badly earlier.

37:25.120 --> 37:27.520
I hope you'll accept my apology.

37:29.320 --> 37:32.990
It must have been strange to
find us all there, My Lady.

37:33.040 --> 37:35.830
Nevertheless, I have no
excuse to behave as I did.

37:35.880 --> 37:38.670
Not to someone who deserves
our loyalty as you do.

37:38.720 --> 37:41.430
- Please forgive me.
- Of course.

37:41.480 --> 37:44.790
I can only say I was angry about
something quite different.

37:44.840 --> 37:46.830
I allowed it to cloud my judgement.

37:46.880 --> 37:48.870
We've all done that, My Lady.

37:48.920 --> 37:51.470
Finally, I'd like you to have this coat.

37:51.520 --> 37:54.270
I... I'm not sure it was a good idea.

37:54.320 --> 37:58.990
Please. Or I'll feel I've spoiled the day,
which is the very last thing I'd want to do.

37:59.040 --> 38:01.310
Furthermore, I want you to keep it.

38:01.360 --> 38:02.950
Well, I...

38:03.000 --> 38:06.680
I've asked Baxter to fit it for you
tonight. She's happy to do that.

38:08.680 --> 38:11.310
Very well, My Lady. I'm very grateful.

38:11.360 --> 38:13.960
I'm not sure when I'll wear it again.

38:14.640 --> 38:17.310
- But you never know.
- You never do.

38:20.120 --> 38:23.520
- I'll say good night.
- Good night, Your Ladyship.

39:12.740 --> 39:15.080
- For Mr Carson.
- Thank you.

39:26.540 --> 39:28.610
- (KNOCKING)
- Come in.

39:30.500 --> 39:32.490
Thank you, Mrs Patmore.

39:32.540 --> 39:34.540
That's lovely.

39:36.180 --> 39:38.890
- What's happened? What's the matter?
- Nothing's the matter.

39:38.940 --> 39:40.930
We've come to dress the bride.

39:40.980 --> 39:43.920
There's a sentence I
never thought I'd hear.

39:45.940 --> 39:47.930
Ring and...

39:47.980 --> 39:49.970
Ring.

39:50.020 --> 39:52.020
Ohh...

39:57.980 --> 40:00.690
- Mr Brock brought these for you.
- What are they?

40:00.740 --> 40:03.650
They're roses with
heather for buttonholes.

40:03.700 --> 40:05.770
He's done that to one of Mrs Hughes'.

40:05.820 --> 40:09.010
- Very nice, but whom are they for?
- For you and your ushers.

40:09.060 --> 40:11.050
My ushers? I've not got any ushers.

40:11.100 --> 40:13.410
- Perhaps you should
have, Mr Carson. - Oh...

40:13.460 --> 40:15.850
Take one for yourself. Give one to Andrew.

40:15.900 --> 40:19.170
- Remove the fern.
- What about me, Mr Carson?

40:19.220 --> 40:23.340
Take one. I might as well be
hanged for a sheep as a lamb.

40:31.180 --> 40:33.890
For better, for worse,
for richer, for poorer,

40:33.940 --> 40:35.930
in sickness and in health,

40:35.980 --> 40:38.450
to love, cherish, and to obey,

40:38.500 --> 40:40.490
till death us do part.

40:40.540 --> 40:43.140
According to God's holy ordinance...

40:47.820 --> 40:49.930
With this ring, I thee wed.

40:49.980 --> 40:52.730
With my body, I thee worship.

40:52.780 --> 40:56.730
All my worldly goods, I thee endow.

40:56.780 --> 41:01.740
In the name of the Father and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost, Amen.

41:02.940 --> 41:08.260
In the name of the Father and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost, Amen.

41:12.300 --> 41:14.290
Ohh...

41:14.340 --> 41:17.140
I now pronounce you man and wife together.

41:25.780 --> 41:27.780
♪ BAGPIPES

41:36.020 --> 41:38.020
Oh, thank you.

41:42.820 --> 41:44.820
(CHEERING)

41:50.380 --> 41:53.690
- I'm so glad to see you here.
- Couldn't miss Carson's wedding.

41:53.740 --> 41:57.250
I felt uncomfortable about the
way I spoke to you the other day.

41:57.300 --> 42:00.490
- You said what you thought.
- I don't think I did. Not truly.

42:00.540 --> 42:02.530
I was exasperated by Lady Grantham.

42:02.580 --> 42:04.170
And you got in the way.

42:04.220 --> 42:07.810
Don't be too quick to condemn
yourself. I'm not sure you were wrong.

42:07.860 --> 42:10.570
Maybe I haven't focused on
what's best for the village.

42:10.620 --> 42:12.210
What is this?

42:12.260 --> 42:14.930
Dr Clarkson is reviewing his position.

42:15.900 --> 42:18.970
I hope this is wishful
thinking on Mrs Crawley's part.

42:19.020 --> 42:20.730
To be honest, I don't know.

42:20.780 --> 42:24.290
But if something is that important,
it's worth considering more than once.

42:24.340 --> 42:29.410
Really? In my experience, second
thoughts are vastly overrated.

42:29.460 --> 42:31.850
But we mustn't be too blinkered, surely?

42:31.900 --> 42:34.410
It's not just Mrs Crawley
and Lady Grantham.

42:34.460 --> 42:37.330
Your old friend Lord Merton
is in favour of reform.

42:37.380 --> 42:42.380
A peer in favour of reform. It's
like a turkey in favour of Christmas.

42:47.580 --> 42:49.580
(CHEERING)

43:01.900 --> 43:03.890
Nice to see you here.

43:03.940 --> 43:06.450
- A wonderful service.
- Thank you, My Lord.

43:06.500 --> 43:09.490
Please understand that
nothing is going to change.

43:09.540 --> 43:12.130
I doubt you'd agree, Mrs... Carson.

43:12.180 --> 43:15.620
We'll try to keep the
changes manageable, My Lady.

43:17.180 --> 43:19.580
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

43:20.460 --> 43:24.730
I'm so happy for you. I'm sorry if I
made things awkward about the reception.

43:24.780 --> 43:26.770
Please forgive me.

43:26.820 --> 43:30.620
My Lady, Mr Carson would forgive you
if you attacked him with a brick!

43:31.820 --> 43:35.010
You don't have to worry,
you know, Mr Spratt.

43:35.060 --> 43:36.650
No?

43:36.700 --> 43:38.810
I can keep secrets when I want to.

43:38.860 --> 43:43.580
Maybe. But the question
remains, will you want to?

43:44.820 --> 43:46.810
Ah, mm.

43:46.860 --> 43:48.850
You're very sunny again.

43:48.900 --> 43:51.900
- I love weddings, don't you?
- I liked mine.

43:52.980 --> 43:56.290
You would tell me if you'd
fallen in love with someone else?

43:56.340 --> 43:59.080
I shouldn't think so. Not for a moment.

44:01.140 --> 44:03.730
Because there's something
about you just now.

44:03.780 --> 44:06.370
And there's something about you, Mr Bates.

44:06.420 --> 44:08.850
There's definitely something about you.

44:08.900 --> 44:10.900
There she is now.

44:12.820 --> 44:15.890
You won't regret it. She's
more than equal to the task.

44:15.940 --> 44:18.650
In fact, I think she'll do you credit.

44:18.700 --> 44:21.170
I think she'll do you credit, Mr Molesley.

44:21.220 --> 44:24.330
You seem to have been an
excellent influence in all this.

44:24.380 --> 44:29.220
Well, I believe that education is the
gate that leads to any future worth having.

44:30.860 --> 44:33.200
Have you missed your vocation?

44:34.220 --> 44:36.210
I've missed everything, Mr Dawes.

44:36.260 --> 44:38.400
But Daisy doesn't have to.

44:40.660 --> 44:43.330
Mr Mason is so full of
gratitude, Your Ladyship.

44:43.380 --> 44:46.170
It's like a dream after
a nightmare, My Lady.

44:46.220 --> 44:48.210
But please, you mustn't think...

44:48.260 --> 44:50.260
May I have silence?

44:52.180 --> 44:54.170
Thank you.

44:54.220 --> 44:56.210
Mr Barrow.

44:56.260 --> 44:59.050
Before we take our seats,
I believe, as the groom,

44:59.100 --> 45:01.090
that I have the right to a few words.

45:01.140 --> 45:02.810
I will not be prolix,

45:02.860 --> 45:08.330
but it must be right that I mark that
I am the happiest and luckiest of men.

45:08.380 --> 45:12.650
That a woman of such grace and charm

45:12.700 --> 45:17.340
should entrust her life's
happiness to my unworthy charge...

45:18.220 --> 45:20.490
.. passeth all understanding.

45:21.900 --> 45:23.890
To my wonderful bride.

45:23.940 --> 45:25.930
The bride and groom!

45:25.980 --> 45:27.970
ALL: The bride and groom!

45:28.020 --> 45:30.010
To the bride and groom.

45:30.060 --> 45:32.050
Ohh!

45:32.100 --> 45:34.090
Tom!

45:34.140 --> 45:36.730
And Sybbie, darling!
What are you doing here?

45:36.780 --> 45:38.850
And how did you know where to find us?

45:38.900 --> 45:41.290
The hall boy on duty
told me where you were.

45:41.340 --> 45:44.010
It means that I can
congratulate you in person.

45:44.060 --> 45:46.050
Mr and Mrs Carson.

45:46.100 --> 45:49.090
- Oh, are you back for a holiday?
- Say you'll stay!

45:49.140 --> 45:51.130
That's just the point.

45:51.180 --> 45:53.650
I can stay as long as you want me.

45:55.140 --> 45:57.450
I don't understand. What are you saying?

45:57.500 --> 46:00.410
Just this. That I've come back
and I'd like to stay for good.

46:00.460 --> 46:03.170
- If Lord Grantham will have me.
- Of course we'll have you!

46:03.220 --> 46:06.220
- We'll be delighted!
- I echo every syllable.

46:07.460 --> 46:09.450
Hello, darling Sybbie!

46:09.500 --> 46:11.500
Give old Donk a kiss!

46:12.740 --> 46:15.330
Tom, this is such wonderful
news. Are you sure?

46:15.380 --> 46:17.450
I'm really, really sure.

46:20.140 --> 46:22.130
So what happened?

46:22.180 --> 46:24.170
It's quite simple.

46:24.220 --> 46:27.130
I had to go all the way to
Boston to figure something out.

46:27.180 --> 46:29.170
- But that's what I did.
- What was it?

46:29.220 --> 46:31.210
I learned that Downton is my home.

46:31.260 --> 46:33.250
And that you are my family.

46:33.300 --> 46:36.700
If I didn't quite know that
before I left, I know it now.

46:45.620 --> 46:47.610
- Sybbie!
- Marigold!

46:47.660 --> 46:49.660
Hello.

46:52.380 --> 46:56.090
If I am to live out my life here, I need
something to do that isn't just the estate.

46:56.140 --> 46:58.610
- How enterprising.
- We talk about making a difference.

46:58.660 --> 47:00.650
But this could actually change lives.

47:00.700 --> 47:02.810
Hasn't got time to greet her old friends.

47:02.860 --> 47:04.650
When were you a friend of Gwen's?

47:04.700 --> 47:06.690
No-one has sharper eyes than a loving son.

47:06.740 --> 47:08.330
You read that somewhere.

47:08.380 --> 47:10.370
You're not hiding anything?

47:10.420 --> 47:14.450
- Don't give me not possible!
- All right, madam! Finish that mash!

47:14.500 --> 47:17.210
Cousin Isobel is entitled
to put up an argument.

47:17.260 --> 47:19.780
Of course. She's just
not entitled to win it!
