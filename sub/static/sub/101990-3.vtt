00:03.003 --> 00:05.964
The town show fundraiser
is the most important event of the season

00:06.048 --> 00:07.841
and I want us to fit in.

00:07.925 --> 00:09.343
I don't know what I'm doing here.

00:09.426 --> 00:10.969
-I'm Wanda.
-Geraldine.

Wanda, can you read me?

00:12.888 --> 00:15.307
WANDA: Something strange
happened with Dottie.

00:15.390 --> 00:19.102
Well, something strange happened
before that, too. It's hard to explain.

00:19.186 --> 00:22.189
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
-It wasn't so hard to fit in after all.

We got something cooking

01:21.623 --> 01:25.711
And it's looking good

01:25.794 --> 01:28.505
We've got something cooking

01:28.589 --> 01:32.426
And who knew we could

01:32.509 --> 01:39.224
All great expectations
Lead to complications

01:39.349 --> 01:41.143
But it's groovy and fun

01:41.226 --> 01:44.521
It's me and it's you

01:44.605 --> 01:47.608

02:04.499 --> 02:07.377
It's you and it's me

-Yep! Definitely pregnant.
-(WANDA CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

02:32.945 --> 02:34.947
Well, that much we figured.

02:35.030 --> 02:36.990
It's just kinda taken us by surprise.

02:37.074 --> 02:39.284
It's just kinda suddenly.
Quite suddenly, wasn't it?

02:39.368 --> 02:42.788
I mean, practically overnight.
I mean... (HESITATES) How did this happen?

02:43.580 --> 02:46.708
You see, when a man and a woman

02:47.376 --> 02:49.378
love each other very much...

02:50.879 --> 02:55.175
Well, we're just tickled pink, or blue.

02:55.259 --> 02:57.845
You're at about four months now.
Is that right?

03:00.597 --> 03:02.266
I thought as much.

03:02.349 --> 03:06.228
We let the little ladies keep tabs
on their growing babies with fruit.

03:06.895 --> 03:08.146
Makes it simple for them.

03:08.897 --> 03:11.733
At four months,
the fetus is about as big as a pear.

03:11.817 --> 03:14.152
At five months, a papaya. Six, grapefruit.

03:14.236 --> 03:18.824
-Seven, pineapple. Eight, honeydew.

Hypothetically speaking,

03:20.325 --> 03:23.412
what size fruit would it be
at, say, hmm, 12 hours?

03:24.121 --> 03:25.372
Uh, pardon? 12 hours?

03:25.455 --> 03:28.000
Well, I think this line of questioning
is fruitless. (CHUCKLES)

03:28.083 --> 03:31.420
Well, hypothetically speaking,
should we be concerned?

03:32.754 --> 03:37.467
Hypothetically speaking,
every new father-to-be gets nervous.

03:37.551 --> 03:40.971
Well, I have nerves of steel,
so there goes your theory, Mr. Doctor...

03:41.054 --> 03:43.265
Vision, why don't you see the doctor out?

03:43.348 --> 03:44.892
Good idea. Yes.

03:44.975 --> 03:48.896
Thank you so much
for dropping by, Dr. Nielson.

03:49.605 --> 03:51.982
Well, I'm just glad you caught me in time.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.693
I'm taking the wife
on vacation this afternoon.

You know, just between us because, uh,

04:02.868 --> 04:04.953
I don't know,
everything's happening so quickly.

04:05.037 --> 04:07.873
We'd like to keep the news
just in the family for right now.

taken the hedge-trimming

Yeah. Don't mention it.

Huh.

04:38.529 --> 04:40.489
Strangest thing
just happened outside with...

We've got nothing to worry about.

Nothing to worry about

you should probably sit down.

the fetal development thus far...

But first, I gotta borrow a bucket.

12:37.925 --> 12:39.885
Not to wear, to use.

12:39.968 --> 12:42.346
Somehow, all the pipes in my ceiling

12:42.429 --> 12:44.515
burst at once and I gotta bail myself out.

12:44.598 --> 12:46.141
All right, sure.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.893
Just stay right there.

12:47.976 --> 12:50.229
I think I might have
a bucket in the kitchen.

Oh, that... Oh! Say, Wanda,
I've got a question for you.

You know how I've been
working that temp job, right?

13:38.861 --> 13:43.198
Well, my boss, Mr. Haddox,
he was going crazy yesterday...

13:44.992 --> 13:49.454
Oh, look at me going on and on
like you got all the time in the world.

13:49.538 --> 13:51.582
-Let me go on and get out...
-(LOUDLY) Wait. No.

13:51.665 --> 13:54.585
-Tell me about the temp job.
-Oh, that's my girl.

13:54.668 --> 13:57.838
So, yesterday my boss, Mr. Haddox,

13:57.921 --> 14:01.592
was going crazy working on the slogan
for a new breakfast cereal.

14:01.675 --> 14:04.511
You know, the one
with the little marshmallow Moonmen?

14:05.804 --> 14:08.307
-Oh.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, those.

14:08.390 --> 14:11.894
So, it's 10 minutes
before the big presentation,

14:11.977 --> 14:14.605
and Mr. Haddox has got nothin'.

14:14.730 --> 14:20.444
Nothin', that is, except
the worst case of hiccups I ever did see.

14:20.527 --> 14:24.156

I am helping Mr. Haddox
do a handstand under the water cooler...

15:13.121 --> 15:15.791

And wouldn't you know it,
in that moment, in walks the client.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.004
Oh, no.

Oh, yes. Oh, yes. But you know me, Wanda,

no matter what's goin' down.

15:26.176 --> 15:27.845
I look at the client,

15:27.928 --> 15:32.182
and I look at Mr. Haddox's feet
floating in the air next to me,

15:32.266 --> 15:34.476
and I look back at the client, and I say,

right before he told me
to clean out my desk.

15:49.658 --> 15:51.660
(GASPS) Oh, no, Geraldine.

15:52.286 --> 15:53.287
He didn't fire you.

15:53.370 --> 15:54.788
Oh, sugar.

15:55.581 --> 15:57.040
He hired me.

16:06.341 --> 16:08.468
Do y'all still keep
those in your spare room?

16:08.552 --> 16:10.929
