00:46.703 --> 00:48.273
Shit.

01:45.029 --> 01:46.831
Mr. Myles?

01:48.098 --> 01:49.697
Why don't you tell me
what happened

01:49.699 --> 01:52.536
the week before that trip?

01:54.971 --> 01:56.708
Mr. Myles?

01:57.975 --> 02:00.577
You want her back,
don't you?

02:21.097 --> 02:24.968
How long were you planning
that trip, Mr. Myles?

02:26.536 --> 02:28.069
Not long.

02:28.071 --> 02:30.140
Just a few days.

02:32.143 --> 02:35.079
So why all of a sudden?

02:36.479 --> 02:38.245
<i>She wasn't well.</i>

02:38.247 --> 02:43.517
<i>I thought a vacation would help
to get away from everything.</i>

02:43.519 --> 02:44.888
<i>The stress.</i>

02:45.756 --> 02:47.655
<i>Stress?</i>

02:47.657 --> 02:50.794
<i>What kind of stress
was she under?</i>

02:52.696 --> 02:55.098
<i>She had a miscarriage.</i>

04:37.700 --> 04:40.203
<i>She really wanted
to have kids.</i>

04:42.573 --> 04:45.239
<i>All her friends did.</i>

04:45.241 --> 04:47.609
<i>And...</i>

04:47.611 --> 04:50.311
<i>it was hard for me because...</i>

04:50.313 --> 04:56.253
<i>we were not in a position
financially to... have 'em.</i>

05:46.102 --> 05:50.771
<i>It seemed like she was
looking for something...</i>

05:50.773 --> 05:52.706
<i>between us...</i>

05:52.708 --> 05:55.179
<i>that was missing, and...</i>

05:56.513 --> 06:01.148
<i>I was always busy
trying to deal with...</i>

06:01.150 --> 06:06.054
<i>an investment that I made
on the gallery, and...</i>

06:06.056 --> 06:09.060
<i>I didn't wanna bother her
with that.</i>

10:36.259 --> 10:40.627
The tide is really coming in.
We should head back.

10:40.629 --> 10:42.265
Okay.

10:59.115 --> 11:01.583
Are you kidding me?

11:01.585 --> 11:03.251
Stupid phone.

11:03.253 --> 11:04.652
It's supposed to work
everywhere.

11:04.654 --> 11:08.491
That's why they call it
a satellite phone.

11:13.229 --> 11:15.298
I'm sorry, what?
What did you say?

11:22.839 --> 11:24.872
What?

11:24.874 --> 11:26.907
Were you just making fun of me?

11:26.909 --> 11:29.075
I was just saying something.

11:29.077 --> 11:31.011
What was it?

11:31.013 --> 11:33.048
This phone is not working.

11:33.050 --> 11:34.351
Oh.

13:45.514 --> 13:47.848
<i>There was just something
about this island</i>

13:47.850 --> 13:50.553
<i>that didn't feel right.</i>

13:51.821 --> 13:53.320
<i>I couldn't tell her</i>

13:53.322 --> 13:55.957
<i>'cause I didn't wanna
freak her out.</i>

13:55.959 --> 13:59.196
<i>She seemed... happy.</i>

14:00.696 --> 14:03.566
<i>I didn't wanna take that
away from her.</i>

14:51.547 --> 14:54.448
- Here you go.
- Oh!

15:08.163 --> 15:10.931
Taste like ground lizard.

15:13.070 --> 15:14.934
It's not bad.

15:14.936 --> 15:17.005
- Yeah?
- Yes.

15:17.007 --> 15:19.143
It's not bad.

15:25.883 --> 15:28.216
This place is amazing,
isn't it?

15:28.218 --> 15:30.050
Mm.

15:30.052 --> 15:31.285
Yeah, it is.

15:41.230 --> 15:42.365
Hey.

15:43.231 --> 15:44.832
Yeah?

15:44.834 --> 15:47.200
Do you know
what I love about you?

15:47.202 --> 15:48.935
Tell me.

15:48.937 --> 15:50.538
You...

15:50.540 --> 15:52.607
are easy to get a smile from.

15:52.609 --> 15:54.174
- Like this!
- Oh, fuck...

15:56.245 --> 15:57.545
- Ugh! Goddamn it.
- I'm sorry, babe.

15:57.547 --> 15:59.112
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

15:59.114 --> 16:02.385
- Here, you can have mine.
- No, no, it's okay.

16:04.120 --> 16:05.987
What's wrong?

16:05.989 --> 16:08.756
Nothing.

16:08.758 --> 16:14.462
<i>I don't know where she wouldn't
have these moments where...</i>

16:14.464 --> 16:17.935
<i>she'd just lash out at me.</i>

16:22.003 --> 16:23.603
Do you hear that?

16:23.605 --> 16:27.274
Could be those sounds are
a Sasquatch or something.

16:30.278 --> 16:31.612
Did you hear that?

16:31.614 --> 16:32.916
- What?
- Shh.

16:44.224 --> 16:44.726
Oh...

16:46.028 --> 16:48.795
- You're such a wuss!
- How dare you.

16:48.797 --> 16:49.830
I wasn't scared.

16:49.832 --> 16:52.299
Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah.
Big tough guy.

16:52.301 --> 16:53.700
You're my big, strong man.

16:53.702 --> 16:55.672
Yes, I am.

16:57.473 --> 17:00.107
You know what I love
about you?

17:00.109 --> 17:02.242
- My good looks.
- Oh!

17:02.244 --> 17:04.810
Oh, so sure of yourself!

17:27.403 --> 17:29.706
Did you get that phone
to work?

17:32.074 --> 17:33.340
No.

17:33.342 --> 17:37.281
Still can't get a signal
on this island.

17:39.482 --> 17:40.982
But it's a satellite phone.

17:40.984 --> 17:44.251
It's supposed to work
everywhere, right?

17:44.253 --> 17:45.455
Yup.

17:46.956 --> 17:50.890
Maybe the satellite is
on the other side of the planet,

17:50.892 --> 17:53.560
so we just have to wait for it
to come around.

17:53.562 --> 17:56.530
Yeah, that's probably
all we have to do.

17:56.532 --> 17:59.133
You... You are fucked up.

17:59.135 --> 18:00.201
I am?

18:00.203 --> 18:01.469
Yeah.

18:01.471 --> 18:02.703
No.

18:08.644 --> 18:13.047
<i>For the first time
in a long, long time,</i>

18:13.049 --> 18:17.487
<i>we were spending time together
on our own.</i>

18:21.090 --> 18:25.594
<i>It seemed like our relationship
was getting better.</i>

18:33.436 --> 18:35.604
<i>We were happy together.</i>

18:37.773 --> 18:42.345
<i>Not thinking about
anything else but each other.</i>

18:46.081 --> 18:47.883
He lives.

18:49.752 --> 18:51.652
Come on, let's go.

18:51.654 --> 18:53.754
What time is it?

18:53.756 --> 18:57.092
Oh, gosh, it's like,
maybe 2:00.

18:58.224 --> 18:58.658
What?

18:58.660 --> 19:00.730
Oh, yeah.
You've been sleeping all day.

19:02.831 --> 19:05.832
I didn't wanna wake you, but...
now I'd really like to get going

19:05.834 --> 19:07.603
'cause we're gonna lose light.

19:28.690 --> 19:30.693
Where we going again?

19:33.362 --> 19:35.131
Up there.

20:25.613 --> 20:27.447
You okay, baby?

20:27.449 --> 20:28.616
Uh...

20:28.618 --> 20:30.818
- You wanna sit down?
- Huh?

20:30.820 --> 20:33.287
- You wanna sit for a sec?
- Yeah.

20:33.289 --> 20:35.623
Yeah, that's a good idea.

20:53.676 --> 20:55.712
Want some water?

20:58.147 --> 20:59.213
You sure?

20:59.215 --> 21:01.016
Yeah.

21:22.605 --> 21:24.207
Oh, wow.

21:25.574 --> 21:27.607
Wow.

21:27.609 --> 21:29.542
Look at this.

21:29.544 --> 21:32.847
This whole thing is just...

21:32.849 --> 21:35.886
is just resting on this rock,
this one little rock.

21:41.256 --> 21:43.158
Isn't that amazing?

21:46.495 --> 21:50.032
It's so powerful,
so powerful.

22:38.013 --> 22:39.280
Come on.

22:39.282 --> 22:41.415
I don't think I'm gonna
make it to the top.

22:41.417 --> 22:44.217
Well, maybe you should have
another cigarette.

22:44.219 --> 22:47.421
You know what?
Maybe I will.

22:47.423 --> 22:51.161
Okay, well, maybe I'll see you
at the top then.

23:25.829 --> 23:28.965
Did you try
to get her some help?

23:41.444 --> 23:43.379
<i>I asked her to.</i>

23:44.679 --> 23:47.216
<i>But she didn't wanna.</i>

23:51.186 --> 23:53.857
<i>She said there's
nothing wrong with her.</i>

23:57.892 --> 24:00.896
<i>And when I asked her again...</i>

24:03.500 --> 24:05.435
<i>she got very mad at me.</i>

24:10.039 --> 24:13.176
<i>I don't know
why she was so unhappy.</i>

24:16.111 --> 24:18.782
<i>Maybe it was just me.</i>

24:22.051 --> 24:25.120
<i>She wasn't always like that.</i>

24:45.108 --> 24:47.540
Baby...

24:47.542 --> 24:49.846
I'm sorry. I'm tired.

26:19.401 --> 26:21.300
Ah!

26:21.302 --> 26:22.603
Fuck.

26:22.605 --> 26:24.437
Oh!

26:24.439 --> 26:26.308
Oh! Oh!

26:32.848 --> 26:34.615
Ah, oh!

26:34.617 --> 26:36.983
- This isn't fun at all!
- Aw, come on.

26:36.985 --> 26:38.853
There's a big surprise
on the other side.

26:38.855 --> 26:40.190
Trust me. It's worth it.

26:52.634 --> 26:54.835
Oh, my God.

26:54.837 --> 26:57.570
That was so perfect.

26:59.509 --> 27:02.709
Okay, so you think
this is funny, huh?

27:02.711 --> 27:04.347
Yeah, actually.

27:05.414 --> 27:06.346
Don't!

27:06.348 --> 27:08.682
John, don't.

27:08.684 --> 27:10.049
Don't.

27:10.051 --> 27:11.318
John, don't.

27:11.320 --> 27:12.819
You're still laughing.

27:12.821 --> 27:15.021
- I'm not.
- You're still laughing.

27:15.023 --> 27:16.822
John, stop it!

27:16.824 --> 27:18.392
- You stop it.
- No.

27:18.394 --> 27:19.329
Stop.

27:34.976 --> 27:36.478
Baby, I'm sorry.

27:47.089 --> 27:49.356
Come on! Eat it!

27:49.358 --> 27:50.326
Come on!

28:04.540 --> 28:05.541
Whoo!

28:08.676 --> 28:11.243
Whoo! Oh!

28:18.119 --> 28:19.321
Whoo!

28:20.488 --> 28:22.457
Come on!

28:25.627 --> 28:26.628
What?

28:32.935 --> 28:34.671
What is it?

28:47.416 --> 28:48.417
Hey!

29:12.707 --> 29:16.178
I thought you got rid of
that thing when I asked you to.

29:18.147 --> 29:19.713
I did.

29:19.715 --> 29:21.482
You did not.

29:21.484 --> 29:24.320
Just brought it
for extra precautions, okay?

29:26.288 --> 29:28.688
You're right. I'm sorry
I didn't get rid of the gun

29:28.690 --> 29:31.224
when you asked me to.

29:33.795 --> 29:35.731
Why do you always lie to me?

29:37.367 --> 29:40.003
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is this funny to you?

29:46.108 --> 29:47.773
Jesus!

29:47.775 --> 29:49.042
What's this for, huh?

29:49.044 --> 29:51.279
What the hell
is wrong with you?

30:05.194 --> 30:07.562
Why are you so angry
all the time?

30:21.676 --> 30:25.580
You don't have
any respect for me, do you?

30:33.188 --> 30:34.423
Amy, come on!

31:08.123 --> 31:09.822
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Boater.

31:09.824 --> 31:13.359
<i>Hey, you're alive!
How's it going over there?</i>

31:13.361 --> 31:14.728
Not so good.

31:14.730 --> 31:17.731
<i>Surprise, surprise.</i>

31:17.733 --> 31:20.834
<i>When is it ever good
with you, buddy?</i>

31:20.836 --> 31:22.368
Fuck off.

31:22.370 --> 31:25.071
<i>What's going on now?</i>

31:25.073 --> 31:27.973
Worried she's gonna find out
what we're up to.

31:27.975 --> 31:30.743
She's already mad at me
'cause I brought the gun.

31:30.745 --> 31:32.178
<i>Oh.</i>

31:32.180 --> 31:34.047
<i>That's not good.</i>

31:34.049 --> 31:35.415
<i>You got a big problem then.</i>

31:35.417 --> 31:37.149
You're not much of a friend.

31:37.151 --> 31:39.319
<i>I just work for you, remember?</i>

31:39.321 --> 31:42.625
<i>You don't pay me
to sympathize with you.</i>

31:44.192 --> 31:46.529
<i>So what's the plan then?</i>

31:48.330 --> 31:50.797
I don't know yet.
I'll let you know later.

31:50.799 --> 31:53.267
<i>So why'd you call?
Miss me?</i>

31:53.269 --> 31:54.969
Stop joking around, man.

31:54.971 --> 31:57.203
<i>All right. I apologize.</i>

31:57.205 --> 32:00.340
I wanna make sure you don't call
'cause I had to lie to her

32:00.342 --> 32:02.341
that this phone has no signal.

32:02.343 --> 32:05.879
<i>Oh. Why would you say that?</i>

32:05.881 --> 32:07.848
It's my only excuse
to get away,

32:07.850 --> 32:09.449
to try and get a signal
to make a call.

32:09.451 --> 32:11.684
Do I really have
to spell this out?

32:11.686 --> 32:14.590
<i>All right, just let me know.
Everything will be ready.</i>

32:21.731 --> 32:24.731
You know what I think,
Mr. Myles?

32:24.733 --> 32:26.265
You didn't really go
to that island

32:26.267 --> 32:28.868
to spend time with your wife.

32:28.870 --> 32:32.272
So why don't you just
be honest with me

32:32.274 --> 32:36.845
and tell me
why you took her there.

32:58.434 --> 33:00.770
<i>The gallery
wasn't doing too good.</i>

33:03.606 --> 33:05.741
<i>I was gonna close it down.</i>

33:14.916 --> 33:19.222
<i>But then I got
this phone call...</i>

33:21.255 --> 33:25.427
<i>about this old native plaque.</i>

33:30.064 --> 33:32.031
<i>We're calling
to inform you, sir,</i>

33:32.033 --> 33:34.634
<i>that we have not received
rental payment for your gallery</i>

33:34.636 --> 33:36.502
<i>for over 60 days.</i>

33:36.504 --> 33:38.171
<i>Your current
outstanding balance</i>

33:38.173 --> 33:40.876
<i>must be paid
within five business days.</i>

33:42.878 --> 33:45.244
<i>Sir?</i>

33:45.246 --> 33:47.550
Okay. I'll look into it.
Thank you.

33:54.523 --> 33:55.888
Have a seat.

33:55.890 --> 33:56.891
Thank you.

34:07.903 --> 34:11.938
He wants to know
if you like them.

34:11.940 --> 34:13.206
Yes. They're beautiful.

34:21.583 --> 34:23.849
He's saying that this collection
brings him good luck,

34:23.851 --> 34:26.453
but to their people,
it can be quite the opposite,

34:26.455 --> 34:28.487
and he wants to know
if you know why.

34:28.489 --> 34:30.255
I'm not exactly sure.

34:34.397 --> 34:36.565
Because they believe
as they're told.

34:37.933 --> 34:39.601
I see.

34:56.418 --> 34:59.889
"Cursed Shrine?"

35:01.623 --> 35:04.489
Have I heard of
The Cursed Shrine? Yes.

35:04.491 --> 35:06.625
Do you believe?

35:06.627 --> 35:10.365
I'm not familiar
with its history.

35:46.634 --> 35:50.136
<i>I found out
that it was placed there</i>

35:50.138 --> 35:55.610
<i>to commemorate
a small tragic event.</i>

35:56.878 --> 35:58.744
<i>That's why the locals
are afraid</i>

35:58.746 --> 36:00.616
<i>to set foot on that island.</i>

36:03.518 --> 36:06.489
<i>They believe that there's
something protecting it.</i>

36:13.696 --> 36:15.063
<i>I felt it.</i>

36:16.197 --> 36:18.500
<i>But somehow...</i>

36:19.835 --> 36:22.705
<i>it seemed to draw her in.</i>

36:53.067 --> 36:56.171
<i>She seemed to be
so curious about it.</i>

36:59.406 --> 37:01.643
<i>Like a siren.</i>

37:22.964 --> 37:26.333
<i>I wasn't afraid
of the creature.</i>

37:26.335 --> 37:28.838
<i>They were just tales.</i>

37:30.438 --> 37:33.542
<i>She seemed to be
in a different world.</i>

37:35.743 --> 37:38.213
<i>But it was scaring me.</i>

37:41.882 --> 37:44.819
<i>It was beyond her grief.</i>

37:46.522 --> 37:48.523
<i>It was something...</i>

37:49.857 --> 37:51.759
<i>something else.</i>

39:35.764 --> 39:37.266
Amy!

40:01.556 --> 40:02.891
Amy.

40:07.429 --> 40:08.661
Amy?

40:08.663 --> 40:09.865
Hey.

40:12.634 --> 40:15.101
Wake up. Wake up, Amy.

40:15.103 --> 40:16.338
Amy.

40:18.339 --> 40:19.874
Wake up, Amy.

40:22.476 --> 40:24.744
Yes.

40:24.746 --> 40:26.148
Wake up.

40:28.449 --> 40:30.118
Are you hurt?

40:32.286 --> 40:33.755
Amy?

40:34.688 --> 40:36.891
How's your head, baby?

40:38.560 --> 40:39.895
Can you move?

40:42.797 --> 40:44.331
Come on.

40:44.333 --> 40:46.500
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

40:46.502 --> 40:48.436
Slowly.
Watch your head.

40:49.536 --> 40:51.040
Watch your head.

40:54.509 --> 40:56.311
Are you okay, baby?

41:01.650 --> 41:04.119
Hey. Hey.

41:09.023 --> 41:11.426
What's wrong?
Hey, hey, hey.

41:14.429 --> 41:15.831
Ah!

41:17.766 --> 41:19.301
Are you okay?

42:07.281 --> 42:10.451
Let's go back tomorrow
to get this treated in town.

42:12.621 --> 42:15.224
Why?

42:16.958 --> 42:19.092
These cuts
are pretty deep, babe.

42:19.094 --> 42:22.061
They might get infected.

42:22.063 --> 42:25.134
It's not that deep.
It's just a scratch.

42:28.270 --> 42:29.905
From what?

42:36.844 --> 42:38.744
I don't know.

42:38.746 --> 42:40.779
What do you mean,
you don't know?

42:40.781 --> 42:42.517
I don't...

42:46.020 --> 42:48.257
I can't remember.

42:49.725 --> 42:52.161
- You don't remember?
- Mm.

42:58.232 --> 42:59.431
Why?

42:59.433 --> 43:00.666
I don't know.

43:00.668 --> 43:03.205
You blacked out?

43:07.542 --> 43:08.844
No.

43:10.179 --> 43:12.679
I don't know.
I don't remember.

43:12.681 --> 43:14.416
Hey.

43:15.851 --> 43:17.817
Are you okay?

43:17.819 --> 43:18.954
Yeah.

43:21.623 --> 43:23.021
Yeah, you are.

43:23.023 --> 43:25.625
Let's just change
the bandage tomorrow.

43:25.627 --> 43:27.228
I'm sure it'll be fine.

47:54.228 --> 47:55.228
Yeah.

47:55.230 --> 47:57.632
Hey, it's me.

47:58.766 --> 47:59.998
Boater, phone.

48:00.000 --> 48:01.166
- What?
- Phone!

48:01.168 --> 48:02.668
- Who is it?
- Take it.

48:02.670 --> 48:05.173
- Bring it to me.
- Take it.

48:09.076 --> 48:10.108
Hello?

48:10.110 --> 48:11.712
It's me.

48:14.014 --> 48:15.413
My fucking boat doesn't start,

48:15.415 --> 48:17.916
so I need you
to come and pick us up.

48:17.918 --> 48:21.121
What do you mean?
Did you check the gas?

48:21.123 --> 48:24.623
Yeah, man,
I checked, I checked.

48:24.625 --> 48:26.692
It doesn't start.
Can you come pick us up?

48:26.694 --> 48:29.797
Dude, that's gonna take all day.

48:46.880 --> 48:51.616
<i>From the moment
I took that plaque,</i>

48:51.618 --> 48:54.522
<i>I felt something had woken up.</i>

48:56.223 --> 49:00.327
<i>Something... evil.</i>

49:53.982 --> 49:55.917
<i>The island went silent.</i>

49:59.353 --> 50:01.590
<i>I could hear everything.</i>

50:03.223 --> 50:08.629
<i>It felt like there was
something lurking behind me.</i>

50:18.205 --> 50:20.007
<i>Following me.</i>

50:22.043 --> 50:23.811
<i>Watching me.</i>

51:32.947 --> 51:34.516
Amy?

51:37.685 --> 51:39.587
Have you been standing there
for long?

51:41.154 --> 51:43.057
I didn't see you.

51:53.400 --> 51:55.333
Our boat wouldn't...

51:55.335 --> 51:58.973
didn't work, so I called
my assistant to come pick us up.

52:04.310 --> 52:06.411
I got the phone to finally work.

52:06.413 --> 52:07.748
Excellent.

52:13.755 --> 52:14.820
Listen,

52:14.822 --> 52:18.190
we're gonna have
to head back home.

52:18.192 --> 52:20.858
Why?

52:20.860 --> 52:24.029
Uh...

52:24.031 --> 52:25.331
'cause you're hurt.

52:25.333 --> 52:27.869
No, I'm not.

52:33.007 --> 52:35.744
Okay, babe...

52:37.911 --> 52:40.811
our boat doesn't work,
and...

52:40.813 --> 52:46.788
Your assistant can just
bring us another one, right?

52:53.862 --> 52:56.064
Our vacation's
just getting started.

53:10.310 --> 53:14.447
<i>That thing that the locals
fear it for</i>

53:14.449 --> 53:16.618
<i>started to get in my head.</i>

54:04.632 --> 54:07.601
How about this, hmm?

54:13.040 --> 54:15.574
I'm gonna look around
for a sec.

54:15.576 --> 54:17.208
I'll be right back.

54:17.210 --> 54:18.479
Okay.

56:07.688 --> 56:09.624
Hello?

56:15.895 --> 56:17.731
Who's there?

56:24.971 --> 56:27.373
Oh, don't be afraid.

56:27.375 --> 56:29.310
I'm not gonna hurt you.

56:45.993 --> 56:48.128
Oh, it's okay. Shh...

56:54.435 --> 56:56.103
Shh...

57:11.384 --> 57:12.886
Amy!

57:53.493 --> 57:55.162
Amy!

57:58.431 --> 58:00.200
Amy!

01:00:01.255 --> 01:00:03.424
No, no.

01:01:03.683 --> 01:01:04.951
Amy!

01:01:23.971 --> 01:01:26.107
Where are you?

01:02:07.114 --> 01:02:08.949
Amy?

01:02:17.391 --> 01:02:18.392
Amy.

01:02:19.826 --> 01:02:21.494
Amy, wait!

01:02:45.085 --> 01:02:46.220
Amy!

01:05:00.719 --> 01:05:02.656
You lied to me.

01:05:09.630 --> 01:05:13.767
You told me you brought me here
so we could spend time together.

01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:27.012
Baby, I'm sorry.

01:05:27.014 --> 01:05:28.849
I really messed up, okay?

01:05:31.018 --> 01:05:33.951
I called my assistant because
our boat wouldn't start,

01:05:33.953 --> 01:05:35.889
and I asked him...

01:05:39.259 --> 01:05:41.395
I asked him to...

01:05:43.429 --> 01:05:45.462
Listen to me.
He's dead, okay?

01:05:45.464 --> 01:05:47.598
He's dead because of me.

01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:50.268
I don't know what happened.

01:05:50.270 --> 01:05:52.406
Something must have
attacked him.

01:05:54.574 --> 01:05:56.644
But we have to get out of here.

01:05:59.446 --> 01:06:00.880
He deserved it.

01:06:04.951 --> 01:06:06.654
You don't mean that.

01:06:12.058 --> 01:06:15.058
How come I'm the last person
you care about, huh?

01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:16.828
Amy, I care about you.

01:06:16.830 --> 01:06:20.201
This is why
I didn't want you to know.

01:06:27.773 --> 01:06:29.507
There's something
very wrong here.

01:06:29.509 --> 01:06:30.911
I don't know what it is.

01:06:32.645 --> 01:06:35.481
And we need to
get out of this island.

01:06:38.252 --> 01:06:39.918
We need to get
your arm treated.

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:41.255
Let's just go.

01:06:49.429 --> 01:06:51.632
I can see it in your eyes.

01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:55.369
We're not working out.

01:06:57.237 --> 01:06:59.536
Don't say that.

01:06:59.538 --> 01:07:01.239
Baby, you're not making...

01:07:01.241 --> 01:07:03.842
You're gonna leave me.

01:07:03.844 --> 01:07:06.746
You're gonna leave me
when we get back.

01:07:19.426 --> 01:07:20.561
Amy, come on.

01:08:30.462 --> 01:08:32.665
<i>This is gonna be
hard to believe.</i>

01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:35.667
<i>I know it's gonna sound crazy.</i>

01:08:39.872 --> 01:08:42.408
<i>She turned into this thing.</i>

01:08:48.846 --> 01:08:52.618
<i>I know it's real.
I know it.</i>

01:16:02.581 --> 01:16:04.183
Mr. Myles.

01:16:06.085 --> 01:16:10.153
You were the last one
to be with your wife,

01:16:10.155 --> 01:16:11.921
and now she's missing.

01:16:11.923 --> 01:16:15.225
Show me in this map...

01:16:15.227 --> 01:16:17.931
where you last saw her.
