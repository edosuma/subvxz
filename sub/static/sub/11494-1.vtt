WEBVTT

03:29.240 --> 03:31.242
It's coming from the courtyard.

03:37.360 --> 03:38.805
It's the Lord Commander!

03:52.520 --> 03:54.443
Help me get him inside.

04:49.520 --> 04:50.885
Thorne did this.

04:55.960 --> 04:58.566
How many of your brothers
do you think you can trust?

04:59.200 --> 05:00.406
Trust?

05:03.680 --> 05:04.727
The men in this room.

05:06.040 --> 05:07.246
Does the wolf know you?

05:09.240 --> 05:10.765
We need all the help we can get.

05:17.320 --> 05:18.685
<i>MELISANDRE". Set Davos.</i>

06:00.920 --> 06:02.843
I saw him in the flames

06:04.640 --> 06:06.404
fighting at Winterfell.

06:10.640 --> 06:12.483
I can't speak for the flames,

06:14.320 --> 06:15.845
but he's gone.

06:36.400 --> 06:38.402
He was our Lord Commander.

06:38.480 --> 06:40.448
He never should have been!

06:43.840 --> 06:45.604
You all know why you're here.

06:49.440 --> 06:51.442
Jon Snow is dead.

06:51.520 --> 06:52.726
Who killed him?

06:53.760 --> 06:55.603
I did.

06:55.680 --> 06:58.206
And Bowen Marsh and Othell Yarwyck

06:58.760 --> 07:00.524
and the other officers in this castle.

07:00.600 --> 07:02.409
- Murderers!
- Traitors!

07:06.640 --> 07:08.529
You're right!

07:08.600 --> 07:10.728
We've committed treason, all of us.

07:11.040 --> 07:13.771
Jon Snow was my Lord Commander.

07:14.880 --> 07:16.689
I had no love for him.

07:17.040 --> 07:18.690
That was no secret.

07:19.360 --> 07:22.603
But I never once disobeyed an order.

07:23.520 --> 07:28.162
Loyalty is the foundation
on which the Night's Watch is built.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.561
And the Watch means everything to me.

07:31.040 --> 07:32.724
I have given my life,

07:32.800 --> 07:36.771
we have all given our lives
to the Night's Watch.

07:39.360 --> 07:43.843
Jon Snow was going to destroy
the Night's Watch.

07:44.280 --> 07:46.567
He let the wildlings through our gates

07:46.880 --> 07:50.089
as no Lord Commander has ever done before.

07:50.480 --> 07:54.804
He gave them the very land
on which they reaved

07:54.880 --> 07:57.406
and raped and murdered.

07:59.200 --> 08:03.000
Lord Commander Snow did
what he thought was right,

08:03.080 --> 08:04.923
I've no doubt about that.

08:06.280 --> 08:10.410
And what he thought was right
would have been the end of us.

08:10.760 --> 08:13.331
He thrust a terrible choice upon us.

08:14.560 --> 08:15.925
And we made it.

08:28.920 --> 08:30.922
He'll have seen we didn't come.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.001
Thorne will have made it official by now.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.605
Castle Black is his.

08:34.679 --> 08:37.206
I don't care who's sitting at the high table.

08:38.159 --> 08:39.605
Jon was my friend.

08:40.919 --> 08:42.842
And those fuckers butchered him.

08:43.840 --> 08:45.285
Now we return the favor.

08:45.360 --> 08:46.805
We don't have the numbers.

08:46.920 --> 08:49.321
- We have a direwolf.
- It's not enough.

08:49.400 --> 08:51.289
I didn't know Lord Commander Snow for long,

08:51.360 --> 08:54.443
but I have to believe he wouldn't have wanted
his friends to die for nothing.

08:54.520 --> 08:57.842
If you were planning to see tomorrow,
you picked the wrong room.

08:59.120 --> 09:00.770
We all die today.

09:01.560 --> 09:04.166
I say we do our best
to take Thorne with us when we go.

09:04.640 --> 09:07.564
We need to fight, but we don't need to die.

09:07.640 --> 09:08.880
Not if we have help.

09:08.960 --> 09:10.121
Who is gonna help us?

09:10.200 --> 09:13.443
You're not the only ones
who owe your lives to Jon Snow.

09:22.160 --> 09:25.164
Bolt the door. Don't let anyone in.

09:25.680 --> 09:27.330
I'll be back as soon as I can.

09:38.040 --> 09:40.850
She was 11 the first time I saw her.

09:43.200 --> 09:45.168
The kennelmaster's daughter.

09:48.120 --> 09:49.849
She smelled of dog.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.843
I wasn't much older,
but everybody was already afraid of me.

09:58.840 --> 10:00.330
You certainly were.

10:06.360 --> 10:07.771
Myranda wasn't, though.

10:08.280 --> 10:11.170
What could I do to her
that those hounds couldn't?

10:11.960 --> 10:13.689
She was fearless.

10:14.160 --> 10:16.083
There was nothing she wouldn't do.

10:22.760 --> 10:25.604
Your pain will be paid for
a thousand times over.

10:29.040 --> 10:31.327
I wish you could be here to watch.

10:36.400 --> 10:39.244
Shall I have a grave
dug for her, my lord?

10:41.000 --> 10:43.810
Or would you rather the men build a pyre?

10:48.880 --> 10:50.245
Buried, burned?

10:51.720 --> 10:54.371
This is good meat. Feed it to the hounds.

10:56.920 --> 10:59.491
Your command of the cavalry
was impressive.

10:59.560 --> 11:02.211
Thanks to you,
the false king Stannis Baratheon is dead.

11:02.840 --> 11:05.047
Do you know who struck the killing blow?

11:05.120 --> 11:06.884
- No.
- A shame.

11:06.960 --> 11:08.371
I'd reward the man.

11:09.240 --> 11:11.561
Still, a great victory.

11:12.920 --> 11:14.490
Do you feel like a victor?

11:19.960 --> 11:23.726
I rebelled against the crown
to arrange your marriage to Sansa Stark.

11:24.560 --> 11:26.324
Do you think that burning wagons in the night

11:26.400 --> 11:28.687
and mowing down tired,
outnumbered Baratheons

11:28.760 --> 11:31.923
is the same as facing
a prepared and provisioned Lannister army?

11:35.120 --> 11:36.167
No.

11:38.600 --> 11:40.204
A reckoning will come.

11:40.280 --> 11:41.770
We need the North to face it.

11:41.840 --> 11:43.285
The entire North.

11:44.440 --> 11:47.011
They won't back us without Sansa Stark.

11:48.440 --> 11:50.647
We no longer have Sansa Stark.

11:51.360 --> 11:53.283
You played your games with her.

11:53.400 --> 11:55.562
You played your games
with the heir to the Iron Islands

11:55.640 --> 11:56.880
and now they're both gone.

11:56.960 --> 11:59.770
I have a team of men after them
with some of my best hounds.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.367
They won't get far.

12:01.440 --> 12:02.930
I'm glad to hear it.

12:03.720 --> 12:06.849
Without Sansa,
you won't be able to produce an heir.

12:06.920 --> 12:09.924
And without an heir, well...

12:13.240 --> 12:16.881
Let's hope the maesters are right
and Lady Walda's carrying a boy.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.490
We can't stop.

12:58.480 --> 13:00.130
We have to cross here.

13:02.960 --> 13:05.486
-I can't.
-It's the only way to throw off the hounds.

13:05.560 --> 13:08.131
But it's too cold. I can't.
I won't make it. I'll die.

13:08.200 --> 13:10.771
I've seen what his hounds do to a person.

13:10.840 --> 13:12.569
This way is better.

13:45.040 --> 13:46.963
Over here. Come on.

14:02.880 --> 14:04.325
Sansa.

14:05.480 --> 14:07.050
Sansa.

14:27.520 --> 14:29.170
Tell them to settle down!

14:30.280 --> 14:31.725
Stay here. I'll lure them away.

14:31.800 --> 14:34.451
- No, I won't make it without you.
- You will.

14:35.800 --> 14:37.564
Go north, only north.

14:38.240 --> 14:39.969
Jon is Lord Commander at Castle Black.

14:40.800 --> 14:41.801
He'll help you.

14:51.160 --> 14:52.446
See somebody, eh?

14:53.600 --> 14:55.011
-There they are!
-Get them!

15:00.640 --> 15:02.005
Where is Lady Bolton?

15:03.520 --> 15:05.284
- Dead.
- Liar.

15:06.080 --> 15:08.447
She broke her leg jumping from the ramparts.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.525
I left her to die in the snow.

15:15.560 --> 15:17.528
Got something! Run!

15:20.240 --> 15:22.163
Hyah!

15:29.600 --> 15:32.001
Resist. Stay.

15:35.360 --> 15:36.441
Stay.

15:36.520 --> 15:40.047
I can't wait to see
what parts Ramsay cuts off you this time.

15:48.880 --> 15:49.881
Rider!

15:50.880 --> 15:52.041
- Who is it?
-It's a bloody woman.

17:00.920 --> 17:03.287
No! Please! Don't!

17:56.280 --> 17:59.090
Lady Sansa, I offer my services once again.

18:01.080 --> 18:06.086
I will shield your back and keep your counsel
and give my life for yours if need be.

18:07.040 --> 18:09.168
I swear it by the Old Gods and the New.

18:19.520 --> 18:20.681
And I vow

18:23.360 --> 18:26.284
that you shall always
have a place by my hearth

18:27.160 --> 18:28.241
and...

18:30.760 --> 18:32.125
Meat and mead at my table.

18:32.200 --> 18:34.407
...meat and mead at my table.

18:37.520 --> 18:41.445
And I pledge to ask no service of you

18:42.200 --> 18:44.202
that might bring you dishonor.

18:45.040 --> 18:47.566
I swear it by the Old Gods and the New.

18:49.360 --> 18:50.486
Arise.

19:36.080 --> 19:39.402
Your Grace,
I'm sorry to disturb you.

19:39.480 --> 19:41.847
A ship from Dorne has sailed into the harbor.

19:43.280 --> 19:44.566
Myrcella.

20:58.200 --> 21:01.090
Do you remember the first time
you saw a dead body?

21:02.360 --> 21:03.441
Mother.

21:06.520 --> 21:10.445
All I could think about when she died
was what would happen to her now.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.684
Every day, every night,

21:17.160 --> 21:19.128
what does Mama look like now?

21:22.000 --> 21:23.684
Has she started to bloat?

21:25.800 --> 21:27.643
Has her skin turned black?

21:29.880 --> 21:32.042
Have her lips peeled back from her teeth?

21:37.560 --> 21:40.211
I think about locking Myrcella in a crypt.

21:41.840 --> 21:44.810
I think about her beautiful little face
starting to collapse.

21:44.880 --> 21:47.121
Don't think about it.

21:48.200 --> 21:49.540
<i>I</i> have to.

21:51.720 --> 21:53.643
I have to.
It's not right she has to suffer alone.

21:53.720 --> 21:56.087
She's not suffering. She's gone.

21:57.520 --> 21:59.284
No one can hurt her anymore.

22:01.600 --> 22:02.931
She was good.

22:04.920 --> 22:07.287
From her first breath, she was so sweet.

22:09.560 --> 22:11.324
I don't know where she came from.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.364
She was nothing like me.

22:16.880 --> 22:18.848
No meanness, no jealousy, just good.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.001
I know.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.725
I thought if I could make something so good,

22:25.840 --> 22:27.126
so pure,

22:30.400 --> 22:31.447
maybe I'm not a monster.

22:31.520 --> 22:33.090
Listen... Listen to me.

22:33.160 --> 22:35.686
She was my daughter and I failed her.

22:35.760 --> 22:37.410
No, I knew this would happen.

22:38.520 --> 22:39.760
The witch told me years ago.

22:42.600 --> 22:45.683
She promised me three children
and she promised me they'd die.

22:45.800 --> 22:47.802
"And gold their shrouds."

22:48.560 --> 22:51.882
Everything she said came true.
You couldn't have stopped it.

22:51.960 --> 22:53.530
It's prophecy. It's fate.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.927
- You don't believe that.
- Of course I do.

22:56.800 --> 22:59.326
You told me yourself when Father died.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.209
You said we had to stay together.

23:02.280 --> 23:05.090
You said people would try to tear us apart,
take what's ours.

23:05.160 --> 23:06.446
That was a prophecy, too.

23:06.520 --> 23:09.330
I didn't listen to you,
and everything you said came true.

23:09.400 --> 23:10.890
Fuck prophecy.

23:10.960 --> 23:13.531
Fuck fate. Fuck everyone who isn't us.

23:14.360 --> 23:18.081
We're the only ones who matter,
the only ones in this world.

23:18.160 --> 23:22.006
And everything they've taken from us,
we're going to take back and more.

23:24.480 --> 23:26.960
We're going to take everything there is.

23:34.200 --> 23:37.921
"The seven hells
brim with the souls of saintly men.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.810
"They scream in agony
and their shame is so great,

23:40.880 --> 23:43.042
"they do not feel the flames,

23:43.120 --> 23:48.809
"for now they see if not for a single sin
they concealed, they were saved."

23:48.880 --> 23:50.564
I'd like to see my brother.

23:50.640 --> 23:52.688
- Confess.
- Please.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.125
How is he? At least tell me that.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.531
Confess.

24:00.600 --> 24:02.762
I am the queen
and I demand to see my brother.

24:02.840 --> 24:04.763
Sinners don't make demands.

24:04.880 --> 24:06.882
They make confessions.

24:10.880 --> 24:12.211
Septa Unella.

24:13.920 --> 24:16.321
Our other guests need you.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.126
There.

24:31.480 --> 24:34.450
Septa Unella can be overzealous at times.

24:34.800 --> 24:35.881
I'll speak with her.

24:37.920 --> 24:40.844
My brother, can you tell me how he is?

24:42.880 --> 24:46.248
It isn't Ser Loras that brings me here.

24:47.960 --> 24:49.724
Your husband misses you dearly.

24:50.720 --> 24:53.451
The love between a man and wife is sacred.

24:54.240 --> 24:57.084
It reflects the love the gods have for all of us.

24:57.440 --> 25:01.001
But sin leads us away from the sacred.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.567
And only confession can purge sin.

25:05.440 --> 25:07.442
I have nothing to confess.

25:08.560 --> 25:11.291
So you believe you are pure?

25:12.080 --> 25:13.127
Perfect?

25:14.280 --> 25:16.009
Wholly without sin?

25:17.760 --> 25:19.125
None of us are.

25:21.400 --> 25:22.925
You have started down the path.

25:25.480 --> 25:27.528
But you have many miles to go.

25:41.640 --> 25:43.881
I always envied Oberyn.

25:44.600 --> 25:45.761
He lived.

25:46.480 --> 25:47.561
He truly lived.

25:47.640 --> 25:49.130
Sailed around the world.

25:49.640 --> 25:51.881
Fought men from every country.

25:51.960 --> 25:54.008
Lay with the most beautiful women alive.

25:54.080 --> 25:55.923
- And men.
- And men.

25:56.320 --> 25:58.482
He experienced everything

25:59.080 --> 26:02.084
while I sat here in Dorne

26:02.160 --> 26:05.801
trying my best to keep my people
alive and well fed.

26:07.080 --> 26:08.764
But that is life.

26:10.440 --> 26:12.249
We each have our roles.

26:12.840 --> 26:16.401
Oberyn was born to be an adventurer.

26:17.600 --> 26:19.523
And I was born to rule.

26:19.640 --> 26:21.290
The gods are not fools.

26:21.840 --> 26:23.922
You would have been a lousy adventurer.

26:24.400 --> 26:25.765
And Oberyn,

26:27.080 --> 26:28.650
he would have been a terrible ruler.

26:29.920 --> 26:32.002
Your mother is a brilliant woman,
you know that?

26:32.840 --> 26:34.330
Prince Doran.

26:46.320 --> 26:48.084
The Princess Myrcella.

27:07.040 --> 27:09.486
When was the last time you left this palace?

27:09.920 --> 27:11.968
You don't know your own people.

27:12.440 --> 27:15.250
Their disgust for you.

27:15.360 --> 27:19.251
Elia Martell, raped and murdered,
and you did nothing.

27:19.880 --> 27:23.646
Oberyn Martell, butchered,
and you did nothing.

27:25.640 --> 27:27.529
You're not a Dornishman.

27:29.320 --> 27:30.890
And you're not our prince.

27:31.960 --> 27:35.248
My son, Trystane...

27:37.120 --> 27:40.363
Your son is weak, just like you.

27:41.320 --> 27:44.369
And weak men will never rule Dorne again.

28:07.440 --> 28:09.329
I told you I'm not hungry.

28:09.920 --> 28:11.888
We're not here to feed you.

28:14.520 --> 28:16.363
We're here to kill you.

28:16.440 --> 28:19.364
You want her to do it or me?

28:19.440 --> 28:22.046
We are family. I don't want to hurt you.

28:22.120 --> 28:25.283
Her or me?

28:30.080 --> 28:31.081
You.

28:32.040 --> 28:33.121
Good.

28:33.520 --> 28:34.760
Smart boy.

28:52.320 --> 28:54.641
You're a greedy bitch, you know that?

29:03.400 --> 29:05.289
We're never going to fix
what's wrong with this city

29:05.360 --> 29:07.806
from the top of an 800-foot pyramid.

29:09.040 --> 29:10.246
We'll be fine.

29:10.960 --> 29:12.849
We're dressed like common merchants.

29:14.800 --> 29:16.529
You walk like a rich person.

29:17.280 --> 29:20.489
You've spent a lot of time studying
the way rich people walk?

29:20.560 --> 29:23.962
You walk as though the paving stones
were your personal property.

29:24.400 --> 29:27.404
I used to steal from people like you
when I was a boy.

29:27.480 --> 29:29.323
It's a good thing
you're not a boy anymore.

29:31.360 --> 29:33.010
Because you have no cock.

29:44.520 --> 29:45.760
For your baby.

29:46.280 --> 29:47.327
To eat.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.047
To eat.

29:51.800 --> 29:53.529
She thinks you want to eat her baby.

29:54.240 --> 29:56.766
His Valyrian is terrible.

29:57.080 --> 29:59.651
He only wants to give you money,

29:59.720 --> 30:03.770
so your baby can eat.

30:17.080 --> 30:18.923
"Mhysa" means "mother" in Valyrian.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.490
I know what "mhysa" means.

30:20.560 --> 30:22.449
- Who wrote it?
- Hard to know.

30:23.000 --> 30:26.288
Our queen is not as popular in Meereen
as she used to be.

30:26.360 --> 30:27.850
The Sons of the Harpy?

30:27.920 --> 30:29.206
Very possibly.

30:31.400 --> 30:34.404
Daenerys Targaryen took away
their most valuable property,

30:34.520 --> 30:37.683
told them human beings
weren't even property to begin with.

30:38.840 --> 30:40.524
You can see why they're unhappy.

30:42.040 --> 30:43.326
Of course,

30:43.920 --> 30:45.809
it could also be the freed men.

30:45.880 --> 30:48.929
For the night is dark and full of terrors.

30:49.320 --> 30:53.405
The Lord of Light sent the
Mother of Dragons to you,

30:53.480 --> 30:57.121
and those who love the
darkness chased her away.

30:57.200 --> 31:00.443
Many of the former slaves feel
that Daenerys has abandoned them.

31:01.120 --> 31:03.964
She did fly away on a dragon
and not come back.

31:04.480 --> 31:06.244
How will you respond?

31:07.120 --> 31:12.160
Will you wring your hands, while you
wait for the Mother of Dragons to return?

31:12.240 --> 31:16.040
Or will you take up her flames yourselves?

31:16.120 --> 31:19.090
Will you fight for your own salvation,

31:19.160 --> 31:21.322
now that Queen Daenerys
is not here to fight for you?

31:22.440 --> 31:23.771
It's a problem.

31:25.960 --> 31:28.486
Fear has brought
Meereen to a standstill.

31:30.480 --> 31:32.881
Whoever you are, wherever you go,

31:33.320 --> 31:35.687
someone in this city wants to murder you.

31:36.320 --> 31:38.926
We can't fight an enemy we don't know.

31:40.160 --> 31:44.165
The Sons of the Harpy planned their
attack in the fighting pits very carefully,

31:44.480 --> 31:47.086
which means they take orders from someone.

31:47.160 --> 31:49.162
And have you started
looking for that someone?

31:49.640 --> 31:52.291
My little birds have already taken wing.

31:52.360 --> 31:56.968
Soon they'll return,
singing songs of men in gold masks.

32:30.680 --> 32:34.844
Well, we won't be sailing to Westeros
anytime soon.

32:57.800 --> 32:59.006
Goat?

32:59.400 --> 33:00.481
Ram.

33:00.880 --> 33:02.609
Do you think our friend got him?

33:04.440 --> 33:07.364
Don't know anything else
that can melt a ram's horn.

33:09.400 --> 33:11.528
We're on the right path, then.

33:12.400 --> 33:14.767
Perhaps she's tired of being queen.

33:14.840 --> 33:16.763
I don't think she likes it very much.

33:16.840 --> 33:18.729
She's too smart to like it.

33:19.320 --> 33:23.041
Maybe she's flown somewhere else,
somewhere far away from men like us.

33:24.200 --> 33:26.248
I've been all over the world.

33:26.320 --> 33:28.004
There's no escaping men like us.

33:28.360 --> 33:30.169
There's no escaping her, eh?

33:30.920 --> 33:33.491
You keep coming back. Why?

33:34.360 --> 33:35.885
You know why.

33:37.720 --> 33:39.245
Isn't it frustrating

33:39.960 --> 33:42.440
wanting someone
who doesn't want you back?

33:43.520 --> 33:45.045
Of course it is.

33:45.120 --> 33:47.851
You're a romantic. I admire that.

33:47.960 --> 33:52.329
Sometimes I look at you and I think,
"So that's what I'll be like when I grow old."

33:52.400 --> 33:53.811
If you grow old.

33:53.880 --> 33:55.041
If I grow old.

33:56.120 --> 33:57.804
I hope I do.

33:57.880 --> 34:00.804
I want to see what the world looks like
when she's done conquering it.

34:01.360 --> 34:02.646
So do I.

34:22.679 --> 34:24.920
Huh, an army?

34:25.679 --> 34:26.966
Not an army.

34:27.320 --> 34:28.560
A horde.

34:54.560 --> 34:55.641
Dothraki?

35:19.440 --> 35:20.726
They have her.

36:11.120 --> 36:12.884
Maybe she saw a ghost.

36:12.960 --> 36:15.850
My friend's mother saw a ghost
and her hair turned white.

36:15.920 --> 36:18.571
Pink people are afraid of the sun.

36:18.640 --> 36:20.608
It burns their skin.

36:20.680 --> 36:24.446
This one stands too long in the sun
and her hair goes white.

36:24.760 --> 36:27.923
You think she's got white pussy hair too?

36:28.000 --> 36:30.241
You ever been with a girl
with white pussy hair?

36:30.320 --> 36:33.449
Only when I was fucking your grandma.

36:35.200 --> 36:38.602
I'll ask Khal Moro for a night with you.

36:38.680 --> 36:40.967
What do you think?

36:41.040 --> 36:44.567
Pretty eyes, but she's an idiot.

36:45.120 --> 36:48.602
She doesn't have to be smart
to get fucked in the ass.

36:48.680 --> 36:54.130
I like to talk when I'm finished.
Otherwise, we might as well be dogs.

37:26.880 --> 37:27.961
No.

37:44.360 --> 37:46.044
For you, my Khal.

37:46.120 --> 37:48.726
The white-haired girl we found in the hills.

37:51.200 --> 37:54.044
Look at those lips, blood of my blood.

37:54.520 --> 37:56.727
Blue-eyed women are witches.

37:56.800 --> 37:58.245
It is known.

37:58.560 --> 38:03.566
Cut off her head,
before she casts a spell on you.

38:05.040 --> 38:06.883
Even if I was blind,

38:07.680 --> 38:09.409
I'd hear my wives say,

38:10.040 --> 38:12.281
"Cut off her head"

38:12.960 --> 38:15.167
and I'd know this woman is beautiful.

38:15.640 --> 38:17.768
I'm glad I'm not blind.

38:17.840 --> 38:21.049
Seeing a beautiful woman naked
for the first time,

38:21.120 --> 38:22.804
what is better than that?

38:22.880 --> 38:24.882
Killing another Khal?

38:27.040 --> 38:28.769
Yes, killing another Khal.

38:28.840 --> 38:32.322
Conquering a city
and taking her people as slaves,

38:32.400 --> 38:35.006
and taking her idols back to Vaes Dothrak.

38:35.080 --> 38:36.844
Breaking a wild horse,

38:36.960 --> 38:39.327
forcing it to submit to your will.

38:40.040 --> 38:42.486
Seeing a beautiful woman naked
for the first time

38:42.560 --> 38:45.928
is among the five best things in life.

38:49.080 --> 38:51.082
Do not touch me.

38:58.080 --> 39:01.323
I am Daenerys Stormborn
of the House Targaryen,

39:02.720 --> 39:05.963
the First of Her Name, the Unburnt,

39:06.040 --> 39:07.485
Queen of Meereen,

39:07.560 --> 39:10.325
Queen of the Andals
and the Rhoynar and the First Men,

39:10.400 --> 39:12.243
Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea,

39:12.320 --> 39:14.322
Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons.

39:34.080 --> 39:36.970
You are nobody, the millionth of your name,

39:37.040 --> 39:38.769
Queen of Nothing,

39:39.480 --> 39:41.130
slave of Khal Moro.

39:41.520 --> 39:43.010
Tonight I will lie with you,

39:43.720 --> 39:45.643
and if the Great Stallion is kind,

39:45.720 --> 39:47.927
you will give me a son.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.968
Do you understand?

39:51.560 --> 39:53.562
I will not lie with you.

39:54.640 --> 39:58.850
And I will bear no children,
for you, or anyone else.

39:58.920 --> 40:02.720
Not until the sun rises in the west,
and sets in the east.

40:03.320 --> 40:05.641
I told you she was a witch.

40:06.080 --> 40:08.003
Cut off her head.

40:08.360 --> 40:12.490
I like her. She has spirit.

40:12.920 --> 40:17.482
I was wife to Khal Drogo,
son of Khal Bharbo.

40:22.360 --> 40:23.885
Khal Drogo is dead.

40:23.960 --> 40:25.246
I know.

40:26.120 --> 40:28.361
I burnt his body.

40:30.400 --> 40:33.563
Forgive me. I did not know.

40:33.640 --> 40:36.564
It is forbidden to lie with a Khal's widow.

40:36.640 --> 40:38.210
No one will touch you.

40:41.840 --> 40:43.365
You have my word.

40:49.520 --> 40:52.205
If you will escort me back to Meereen,

40:53.040 --> 40:56.522
I will see that your khalasar is given
a thousand horses, as a sign of my gratitude.

40:57.960 --> 40:59.371
When a Khal dies,

41:00.360 --> 41:02.727
there is only one place for his khaleesi.

41:05.200 --> 41:08.841
Vaes Dothrak.
The Temple of the Dosh Khaleen.

41:08.920 --> 41:12.686
To live out her days with
the widows of dead khals.

41:14.480 --> 41:16.244
It is known.

41:52.560 --> 41:54.927
But there has to be a price
to pay for everything.

41:55.000 --> 41:58.447
I know, but have you tried
telling him that?

42:06.000 --> 42:07.206
Thank you.

42:08.800 --> 42:11.406
Who'd go there after what
happened to that Kingsguard?

42:11.480 --> 42:12.686
Probably had it coming.

42:12.800 --> 42:14.245
Maybe so, but I'm not risking it.

42:14.320 --> 42:16.129
-Just can't do it.
-All right.

42:16.200 --> 42:18.328
Honesty as well. He gets it.

42:23.560 --> 42:25.289
Are you listening, blind girl?

42:27.280 --> 42:28.645
Do you hear them talking?

42:29.840 --> 42:31.842
Do any of them talk to you?

42:32.800 --> 42:33.961
No.

42:35.480 --> 42:36.641
So sad.

42:43.800 --> 42:46.087
Stand and fight, blind girl.

42:48.320 --> 42:49.401
I can't see.

42:49.480 --> 42:51.448
That's your problem, not mine.

43:19.880 --> 43:21.370
See you tomorrow.

44:13.280 --> 44:16.443
Ser Davos, we have no cause to fight.

44:17.640 --> 44:19.529
We are both anointed knights.

44:19.920 --> 44:22.844
Hear that, lads? Nothing to fear.

44:23.280 --> 44:27.922
I will grant amnesty to all brothers
who throw down their arms before nightfall.

44:28.000 --> 44:31.607
And you, Ser Davos,
I will allow you to travel south

44:32.040 --> 44:34.441
a free man with a fresh horse.

44:36.240 --> 44:37.571
And some mutton.

44:38.480 --> 44:39.811
I'd like some mutton.

44:39.880 --> 44:40.881
What?

44:41.320 --> 44:42.970
I'm not much of a hunter.

44:44.040 --> 44:47.522
I'll need some food
if I'm gonna make it south without starving.

44:51.760 --> 44:53.250
We'll give you food.

44:53.720 --> 44:56.291
You can bring the Red Woman
with you if you like.

44:57.320 --> 45:00.449
Or you can leave her here with us,
whichever you choose.

45:00.960 --> 45:05.204
But surrender by nightfall
or this ends with blood.

45:06.960 --> 45:08.644
Thank you, Ser Alliser.

45:09.120 --> 45:12.886
We'll discuss amongst ourselves
and come back to you with an answer.

45:28.160 --> 45:31.164
Boys, I've been running
from men like that all my life.

45:32.440 --> 45:35.569
In my learned opinion, we open that door...

45:35.640 --> 45:37.051
And they'll slaughter us all.

45:37.120 --> 45:39.487
They want to come in, they're gonna come in.

45:39.560 --> 45:41.801
Aye, but we don't need to
make it easy for them.

45:41.880 --> 45:43.644
Edd is our only chance.

45:43.760 --> 45:46.491
It's a sad fucking statement
if Dolorous Edd is our only chance.

45:48.760 --> 45:50.046
There's always the Red Woman.

45:50.120 --> 45:52.851
What's one redhead gonna do
against 40 armed men?

45:54.480 --> 45:57.006
You haven't seen her do
what I've seen her do.

48:43.430 --> 48:46.430
