01:18.000 --> 01:21.901
<i>He was an old man who fished alone
in a skiff in the Gulf Stream... </i>

01:22.070 --> 01:25.233
<i>... and he had gone 84 days now
without taking a fish. </i>

01:28.009 --> 01:30.409
<i>In the first 40 days, 
a boy had been with him. </i>

01:30.579 --> 01:33.639
<i>But after 40 days without a fish
the boy's parents told him... </i>

01:33.815 --> 01:37.216
<i>... that the old man was now definitely
and finally salao...</i>

01:37.385 --> 01:39.852
<i>... which is the worst form of unlucky... </i>

01:40.020 --> 01:42.784
<i>... and the boy had gone at their orders
in another boat... </i>

01:42.957 --> 01:45.926
<i>... which caught three good fish
the first week. </i>

01:46.627 --> 01:50.324
<i>The old man had taught the boy to fish, 
and the boy loved him. </i>

02:00.940 --> 02:04.842
<i>The old man was gray and wrinkled, 
with deep furrows in the back of his neck... </i>

02:05.011 --> 02:09.710
<i>... and his hands had the deep, creased scars
from handling heavy fish on the cords. </i>

02:09.883 --> 02:12.283
<i>But none of these scars were fresh. </i>

02:12.452 --> 02:16.411
<i>They were as old as erosions
in a fishless desert. </i>

02:17.156 --> 02:20.216
<i>Everything about him was old, 
except his eyes. </i>

02:20.392 --> 02:24.988
<i>And they were the same color as the sea, 
were cheerful and undefeated. </i>

02:37.542 --> 02:41.979
<i>It made the boy sad to see the old man
come in each day with his skiff empty. </i>

02:42.146 --> 02:46.014
<i>He always went down to help him carry
the lines, the gaff and harpoon... </i>

02:46.184 --> 02:48.846
<i>... and the sail that was furled
around the mast. </i>

02:49.187 --> 02:52.623
<i>The sail was patched
with flour sacks, and furled. </i>

02:52.790 --> 02:55.781
<i>It looked like the flag
of permanent defeat. </i>

03:32.994 --> 03:34.791
<i>No one would steal
from the old man... </i>

03:34.963 --> 03:37.796
<i>... but it's better to take
the sail and lines home... </i>

03:37.966 --> 03:39.797
<i>... as the dew was bad for them. </i>

03:39.968 --> 03:42.232
<i>Though he was sure no
local people would steal... </i>

03:42.403 --> 03:44.962
<i>... the old man thought
a gaff and a harpoon... </i>

03:45.138 --> 03:47.902
<i>... were needless temptations
to leave in a boat. </i>

03:48.408 --> 03:52.776
<i>The successful fishermen were already in
and had butchered their marlin out... </i>

03:52.945 --> 03:56.938
<i>... carried them laid full-length
across two planks to the fish house... </i>

03:57.116 --> 04:01.553
<i>... where they waited for the ice truck
to carry them to the market in Havana. </i>

04:10.862 --> 04:13.524
<i>"Can I offer you a beer on the terrace?"
The boy asked. </i>

04:13.698 --> 04:16.997
<i>"Why not?" the old man said. 
"Between fisherman. "</i>

04:21.572 --> 04:23.768
Two beers, Martin. Please.

04:29.013 --> 04:32.744
<i>They sat on the terrace and many
fishermen made fun of the old man. </i>

04:32.916 --> 04:34.747
<i>But he was not angry. </i>

04:35.352 --> 04:38.321
<i>He did not remember
when he had attained humility... </i>

04:38.489 --> 04:40.889
<i>... but he knew he had attained it... </i>

04:41.058 --> 04:45.757
<i>... and he knew it was not disgraceful
and it carried no true loss of pride. </i>

04:46.095 --> 04:49.622
<i>Some of the older fishermen
looked at him and were sad... </i>

04:49.966 --> 04:53.163
<i>... but they did not show it. 
They spoke about the currents... </i>

04:53.336 --> 04:55.930
<i>... and the depths they'd
drifted their lines at... </i>

04:56.105 --> 04:59.905
<i>... and the steady, good weather
and of what they had seen. </i>

05:00.243 --> 05:02.677
- Santiago.
- Yes?

05:02.912 --> 05:05.402
Can I go and get the sardines
for you tomorrow?

05:05.580 --> 05:07.138
Oh, no. No.

05:07.316 --> 05:11.844
You play ball. I can still row,
and I can still throw the net.

05:12.087 --> 05:15.352
I know where I can get four fresh baits.

05:15.991 --> 05:18.482
I still have mine from today.

05:18.660 --> 05:21.060
Let me get four fresh ones.

05:21.997 --> 05:23.691
- One.
- Two.

05:25.533 --> 05:27.091
Two.

05:29.036 --> 05:32.904
- You didn't steal them, did you?
- I would, but I bought these.

05:33.974 --> 05:35.965
Thank you.

05:36.911 --> 05:39.971
If I cannot fish with you,
I'd like to serve in some way.

05:40.514 --> 05:42.037
You bought me a beer.

05:42.215 --> 05:44.615
You are already a man.

06:14.846 --> 06:17.280
<i>They walked up the road together. </i>

06:17.582 --> 06:20.880
<i>The old man stood the mast
outside his shack. </i>

06:21.852 --> 06:25.015
<i>In the old man's shack, 
there was a bed, a table, chairs... </i>

06:25.188 --> 06:27.383
<i>... and a place to cook with charcoal. </i>

06:27.557 --> 06:32.119
<i>On the brown walls, there was a picture
in color of the Sacred Heart of Jesus... </i>

06:32.295 --> 06:34.286
<i>... and another of the Virgin of Cobre. </i>

06:34.464 --> 06:37.058
<i>These were relics of his wife. </i>

06:37.566 --> 06:41.434
<i>Once there had been a tinted photograph
of his wife on the wall. </i>

06:41.604 --> 06:45.131
<i>But he had taken it down because
it made him too lonely to see it. </i>

06:45.307 --> 06:48.799
<i>It was on the shelf in the corner, 
under his clean shirt. </i>

06:55.418 --> 06:58.352
Tomorrow is the 85th day.

06:58.887 --> 07:01.082
Eighty-five is a lucky number.

07:02.257 --> 07:06.353
How'd you like to see me bring one in
that dressed out over a thousand pounds?

07:06.528 --> 07:09.395
Are you strong enough now
for a truly big fish?

07:10.165 --> 07:12.133
I think so.

07:12.300 --> 07:13.961
And there are many tricks.

07:14.902 --> 07:18.599
Santiago, I could go with you again.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.399
We've made enough money.

07:20.841 --> 07:25.335
No, no. You are in a lucky boat.
You stay with them.

07:25.512 --> 07:29.346
Remember how long we went
without fish before?

07:29.516 --> 07:32.576
Then we caught big ones every day
for three weeks.

07:33.853 --> 07:35.684
I remember.

07:35.855 --> 07:38.983
I know you did not leave me
because you lost confidence.

07:39.358 --> 07:43.488
It was my papa made me leave.
I am a boy and I must obey him.

07:43.663 --> 07:46.689
Of course, of course.
It is quite normal.

07:47.166 --> 07:49.532
He hasn't much faith.

07:50.169 --> 07:52.193
- But we have, haven't we?
- Yes.

07:53.038 --> 07:56.201
If you were my boy,
I would take you out again.

07:56.374 --> 08:00.936
But you are your father's and your mother's,
and you are in a lucky boat.

08:02.681 --> 08:04.706
What do you have to eat?

08:04.883 --> 08:08.182
I have a pot of yellow rice and some fish.
Would you like some?

08:08.420 --> 08:09.887
No. I'll eat at home.

08:10.055 --> 08:13.182
- May I take the cast net?
- Of course.

08:14.391 --> 08:16.552
I have yesterday's newspaper.

08:16.727 --> 08:18.285
I will read the baseball.

08:19.497 --> 08:23.297
<i>There was no cast net. The boy remembered
when they had sold it. </i>

08:23.467 --> 08:25.958
<i>But they went through
this fiction every day. </i>

08:26.136 --> 08:30.299
<i>There was no pot of yellow rice and fish, 
and the boy knew this. </i>

08:30.473 --> 08:34.169
<i>He didn't know whether yesterday's paper
was a fiction too. </i>

08:34.477 --> 08:36.909
<i>The old man brought it out
from under the bed. </i>

08:37.078 --> 08:38.409
Keep warm, old man.

08:38.881 --> 08:42.749
Sit in the sun.
Remember, we're in September.

08:44.086 --> 08:46.577
The month of the big fish.

08:48.489 --> 08:50.684
Anybody can be a fisherman in May.

08:51.225 --> 08:53.216
I'll be back when I get the sardines.

08:53.394 --> 08:55.692
Then you can tell me about the baseball.

09:27.660 --> 09:30.424
- Hey, Manolin, come on.
- Play first base.

09:30.596 --> 09:32.530
Hey, yeah. Come on.

09:48.947 --> 09:52.974
- Manolin.
- A dinner for two, please. To take out.

09:53.618 --> 09:56.348
You don't eat at home anymore?

10:02.160 --> 10:06.255
- How much do you have to spend?
- Sixty cents.

10:12.636 --> 10:14.866
No luck yet, huh?

10:15.539 --> 10:18.508
You know, maybe it's not luck at all.
Maybe he's too old.

10:18.675 --> 10:21.074
He's not too old. You'll see.

10:21.243 --> 10:23.905
- I said, maybe.
- Not even maybe.

10:24.747 --> 10:26.442
All right.

10:26.983 --> 10:31.545
I only hope when I'm an old man
I have a boy to fish for me.

10:33.389 --> 10:36.381
<i>When the boy came back, 
the old man was asleep in a chair... </i>

10:36.559 --> 10:38.789
<i>... and the sun was going down. </i>

10:39.028 --> 10:42.554
<i>His shoulders were still powerful, 
although very old. </i>

10:42.731 --> 10:44.358
<i>The neck was still strong too. </i>

10:44.532 --> 10:49.162
<i>The creases did not show so much
when the old man was asleep. </i>

10:49.337 --> 10:52.067
<i>His head was very old, though. </i>

10:52.307 --> 10:55.868
<i>And with his eyes closed, 
there was no life in his face. </i>

10:56.344 --> 10:57.811
Wake up, old man.

11:03.983 --> 11:06.747
<i>The old man opened his eyes, 
and for a long moment... </i>

11:06.919 --> 11:10.116
<i>... he was coming back
from a long way away. </i>

11:14.227 --> 11:15.785
<i>Then he smiled. </i>

11:15.962 --> 11:17.553
What have you got?

11:17.863 --> 11:20.525
- We're gonna have supper.
- I'm not very hungry.

11:21.333 --> 11:24.530
Come on and eat.
You can't fish and not eat.

11:25.771 --> 11:27.068
I have.

11:27.239 --> 11:29.867
You won't fish without eating
while I'm alive.

11:30.542 --> 11:34.842
Well, then you live a long time
and take good care of yourself.

11:36.213 --> 11:38.579
Who... ? Who gave this to you?

11:39.250 --> 11:40.979
Martin. At the terrace.

11:44.255 --> 11:45.654
Well...

11:45.823 --> 11:47.518
... I must be sure and thank him.

11:47.992 --> 11:51.359
I thanked him already.
You don't need to thank him.

11:59.002 --> 12:02.665
<i>They had eaten with no light on the table, 
and it was dark now. </i>

12:02.839 --> 12:06.036
<i>The old man had talked to the boy
about baseball as always. </i>

12:06.209 --> 12:08.939
<i>About the great DiMaggio
and how he was himself again... </i>

12:09.112 --> 12:11.672
<i>... and about the other men on the team. </i>

12:13.082 --> 12:15.778
Tell me about the great John J. McGraw.

12:17.152 --> 12:19.950
He used to come to the terrace sometimes...

12:20.122 --> 12:22.113
... in the olden days too.

12:22.291 --> 12:26.022
His mind was on the horses, I think,
as much as it was on the baseball.

12:26.195 --> 12:31.326
At least he used to carry lists
of horses in his pocket at all times.

12:31.499 --> 12:36.129
And frequently, he would speak
the names of horses on the telephone.

12:37.872 --> 12:41.171
He was a great manager.
My father thinks he was the greatest.

12:41.342 --> 12:43.970
That's because he came here
the most times.

12:44.145 --> 12:46.170
If Durocher had continued coming here...

12:46.347 --> 12:49.145
... your father would think
he was the greatest manager.

12:50.350 --> 12:52.580
Who is the greatest manager, really?

12:53.920 --> 12:56.150
I think they are all equal.

12:59.559 --> 13:02.892
Sometime I would like to take
the great DiMaggio fishing.

13:03.063 --> 13:05.657
They say his father was a fisherman.

13:06.066 --> 13:09.660
Maybe he was poor like we are,
and he would understand.

13:11.303 --> 13:14.932
You ought to go to bed so that
you'll be fresh in the morning.

13:15.374 --> 13:18.605
I'll take these things back to the terrace.

13:26.318 --> 13:30.218
- Good night. See you in the morning.
- You're my alarm clock.

13:30.387 --> 13:32.582
Age is my alarm clock.

13:33.157 --> 13:35.990
- Sleep well, old man.
- Thank you.

13:36.160 --> 13:37.650
Good night.

13:39.029 --> 13:43.432
<i>The boy went out and the old man thought, 
"Why do old men wake so early?</i>

13:43.600 --> 13:46.193
<i>Is it to have one longer day?"</i>

13:53.442 --> 13:56.502
<i>Then the old man rolled up his trousers
to make a pillow... </i>

13:56.679 --> 13:59.204
<i>... putting the newspaper inside them. </i>

13:59.482 --> 14:02.576
<i>He rolled himself in the blanket
and slept on the papers... </i>

14:02.752 --> 14:05.185
<i>... that covered the springs of the bed. </i>

14:10.225 --> 14:12.523
<i>He was asleep in a short time... </i>

14:12.694 --> 14:15.891
<i>... and he dreamed of Africa, 
when he was a boy. </i>

14:31.145 --> 14:35.707
<i>He dreamed of the golden beaches and the
white beaches so white they hurt your eyes. </i>

14:35.883 --> 14:39.011
<i>And the high capes
and the great brown mountains. </i>

14:39.186 --> 14:42.882
<i>He lived along that coast now every night, 
and in his dreams... </i>

14:43.056 --> 14:47.823
<i>... he heard the surf roar, and saw
the native boats come riding through it. </i>

14:56.569 --> 15:00.232
<i>He smelled the tar and oakum
of the deck as he slept... </i>

15:00.405 --> 15:05.536
<i>... and he smelled the smell of Africa that
the land breeze brought with the morning. </i>

15:06.612 --> 15:09.547
<i>Usually when he smelled
the land breeze, he woke up... </i>

15:09.715 --> 15:11.876
<i>... and dressed to go to wake the boy. </i>

15:12.050 --> 15:15.281
<i>But tonight the smell of the land breeze
came very early... </i>

15:15.454 --> 15:18.912
<i>... and he knew it was too early in his dream
and went on dreaming. </i>

15:19.090 --> 15:22.184
<i>To see the white peaks of the island
rising to the sea... </i>

15:22.360 --> 15:27.593
<i>... and he dreamed of the different harbors
and roadsteads of the Canary Islands. </i>

15:29.033 --> 15:31.934
<i>He no longer dreamed of storms
nor of women... </i>

15:32.270 --> 15:34.830
<i>... nor of great occurrences
nor of great fish... </i>

15:35.006 --> 15:39.305
<i>... nor fights nor contests of strength
nor of his wife. </i>

15:39.476 --> 15:42.036
<i>He only dreamed of places now... </i>

15:42.212 --> 15:44.806
<i>... and of the lions on the beach. </i>

15:44.981 --> 15:50.476
<i>They played like young cats, 
and he loved them as he loved the boy. </i>

15:51.922 --> 15:54.082
<i>He never dreamed about the boy. </i>

16:12.106 --> 16:14.404
<i>In the dawn, the old man simply woke... </i>

16:14.575 --> 16:19.807
<i>... looked out the door at the dying moon, 
unrolled his trousers and put them on. </i>

16:28.655 --> 16:31.988
<i>Then went down to wake the boy. 
He was shivering with cold... </i>

16:32.159 --> 16:36.788
<i>... but he knew that he would shiver himself
warm and that soon he would be rowing. </i>

16:47.373 --> 16:50.103
<i>The door of the house
where the boy lived was unlocked... </i>

16:50.276 --> 16:53.540
<i>... and he opened it and walked in quietly
with his bare feet. </i>

16:55.780 --> 17:00.843
<i>The boy was asleep on a cot in the room
and the old man could see him clearly. </i>

17:01.586 --> 17:04.987
<i>He took hold of one foot gently
and held it until the boy woke... </i>

17:05.156 --> 17:06.782
<i>... and turned and looked at him. </i>

17:31.647 --> 17:35.447
<i>The boy was sleepy, 
and the old man said, "I'm sorry. "</i>

17:35.618 --> 17:39.145
<i>"It is what a man must do, "
the boy answered. </i>

17:41.324 --> 17:44.657
<i>They walked down the road, 
and all along the road in the dark... </i>

17:44.827 --> 17:49.160
<i>... barefoot men were moving, 
carrying the masts of their boats. </i>

18:36.008 --> 18:37.703
How did you sleep?

18:38.277 --> 18:41.269
Very well, Manolin. I feel confident today.

18:41.814 --> 18:43.611
I do too.

18:43.782 --> 18:46.306
I'll get the sardines. Be right back.

18:47.385 --> 18:50.684
Have another cup. We have credit here.

19:02.599 --> 19:05.762
<i>The old man drank his coffee slowly. </i>

19:06.069 --> 19:09.505
<i>It's all he'd have all day, 
and he knew that he should take it. </i>

19:09.673 --> 19:14.633
<i>For a long time now, eating had bored him, 
and he never carried a lunch. </i>

19:14.811 --> 19:17.507
<i>He had a bottle of water
in the bow of the skiff... </i>

19:17.681 --> 19:20.548
<i>... and that was all he needed for the day. </i>

20:04.992 --> 20:06.357
Good luck, old man.

20:10.697 --> 20:13.029
Good luck.

20:26.746 --> 20:29.271
<i>There were other boats going out to sea... </i>

20:29.448 --> 20:32.906
<i>... and the old man heard
the dip and push of their oars. </i>

21:28.370 --> 21:31.463
<i>In the dark, the old man could feel
the morning coming. </i>

21:31.639 --> 21:35.803
<i>And as he rode, he heard the trembling
sound as flying fish left the water... </i>

21:35.977 --> 21:40.277
<i>... and the hissing their stiff, set wings
made as they soared away in the darkness. </i>

21:40.581 --> 21:45.575
<i>He was very fond of flying fish, as they
were his principal friends in the ocean. </i>

22:02.502 --> 22:06.336
<i>He was sorry for the birds, 
especially the small, delicate, dark terns... </i>

22:06.506 --> 22:09.838
<i>... that were always flying and looking
and almost never finding. </i>

22:23.756 --> 22:26.691
<i>He thought, "The birds have
a harder life than we do... </i>

22:26.859 --> 22:30.658
<i>... except for the robber birds
and the heavy, strong ones. </i>

22:31.963 --> 22:35.797
<i>Why do they make birds so delicate and
fine when the ocean can be so cruel?</i>

22:35.967 --> 22:41.803
<i>She is kind and very beautiful, 
but she can be so cruel. "</i>

22:55.786 --> 22:59.449
<i>The sun rose from the sea, and
the old man could see other boats... </i>

22:59.623 --> 23:04.458
<i>... low on the water and well in toward
the shore, spread out across the current. </i>

23:05.761 --> 23:07.922
<i>He always thought of the sea as la mar...</i>

23:08.097 --> 23:11.429
<i>... which is what people call her
in Spanish when they love her. </i>

23:11.766 --> 23:14.963
<i>Sometimes those who love her
say bad things of her... </i>

23:15.136 --> 23:18.071
<i>... but they are always said
as though she were a woman. </i>

23:18.340 --> 23:23.709
<i>Some of the younger fishermen spoke of her
as a contestant or a place or an enemy... </i>

23:24.545 --> 23:27.639
<i>... but the old man had always
thought of her as feminine... </i>

23:27.815 --> 23:31.808
<i>... and as something that gave
or withheld great favors. </i>

23:38.559 --> 23:41.823
<i>"The moon affects her as it does a woman, "
he thought. </i>

23:52.905 --> 23:57.103
<i>Before it was light, he had his baits out
and was drifting with the current. </i>

23:57.276 --> 24:00.711
<i>One bait was down 40 fathoms, 
the second was at 75... </i>

24:00.879 --> 24:06.317
<i>... and the third and fourth were down
in the blue water at 100 and 125 fathoms. </i>

24:12.591 --> 24:16.789
<i>Then the sun was brighter and the glare
came on the water, and as it rose clear... </i>

24:16.962 --> 24:20.294
<i>... the flat sea sent it back to his eyes
so it hurt sharply... </i>

24:20.464 --> 24:23.228
<i>... and he rode without looking into it. </i>

24:23.401 --> 24:28.202
<i>He looked down and watched the lines
that went down into the dark of the water. </i>

24:28.372 --> 24:31.808
<i>Each bait hung head-down
with the shank of the hook inside... </i>

24:31.976 --> 24:34.274
<i>... tight and sewed solid. </i>

24:34.512 --> 24:36.412
<i>All of the projecting part of the hook... </i>

24:36.580 --> 24:39.139
<i>... the curve and the point, 
was covered with sardines... </i>

24:39.315 --> 24:44.480
<i>... each sardine hooked through both eyes so
they made a garland of the projecting steel. </i>

24:44.654 --> 24:47.179
<i>There was no part of the hook
that a fish could feel... </i>

24:47.357 --> 24:49.723
<i>... that was not sweet-smelling
and good-tasting. </i>

24:50.727 --> 24:53.218
<i>"I keep them with precision, " he thought. </i>

24:53.530 --> 24:55.998
<i>"Only, I have no luck anymore. </i>

24:56.166 --> 24:58.599
<i>But who knows? Maybe today. </i>

24:58.767 --> 25:01.292
<i>Every day is a new day. </i>

25:02.371 --> 25:05.431
<i>It is better to be lucky, 
but I would rather be exact. </i>

25:05.607 --> 25:08.371
<i>Then when luck comes, you are ready. "</i>

25:14.183 --> 25:16.047
<i>The sun was two hours higher now... </i>

25:16.217 --> 25:20.017
<i>... and it did not hurt his eyes so much
to look into the east. </i>

25:20.555 --> 25:23.581
<i>Just then he saw a man-o'-war bird. </i>

25:27.228 --> 25:33.098
<i>He made a quick drop, slanting down on his
backswept wings, and then circled again. </i>

25:33.301 --> 25:36.292
He's not just looking.
He's found something.

26:11.001 --> 26:12.935
You will make a beautiful bait.

26:18.909 --> 26:23.471
<i>He did not remember when he'd first started
to talk aloud when he was by himself. </i>

26:23.647 --> 26:26.878
<i>In the old days, he had sung
at night when he was alone... </i>

26:27.050 --> 26:29.314
<i>... steering on his watch on the turtle boats. </i>

26:29.485 --> 26:33.717
<i>He had probably started to talk aloud, 
when alone, when the boy had left... </i>

26:33.890 --> 26:35.323
<i>... but he did not remember. </i>

26:35.491 --> 26:39.518
<i>It was considered a virtue
not to talk unnecessarily at sea... </i>

26:39.695 --> 26:43.153
<i>... and the old man had always
considered it so and respected it. </i>

26:43.332 --> 26:45.892
<i>But now he said his thoughts
aloud many times... </i>

26:46.068 --> 26:48.365
<i>... since there was no one they could annoy. </i>

26:48.537 --> 26:51.734
<i>"If the others heard me, " he thought, 
"they would think I am crazy. </i>

26:51.907 --> 26:54.603
<i>But since I am not crazy, I do not care. </i>

26:55.010 --> 27:00.209
<i>And the rich have radios to talk to them
on their boats, to bring them the baseball. "</i>

27:04.986 --> 27:07.954
Yes. Yes.

27:17.064 --> 27:20.522
<i>Then he felt something hard
and unbelievably heavy. </i>

27:20.701 --> 27:22.396
<i>It was the weight of the fish... </i>

27:22.570 --> 27:25.561
<i>... and he let the line slip
down, down, down... </i>

27:25.738 --> 27:28.434
<i>... unrolling off the first
of the two reserve coils. </i>

27:28.608 --> 27:31.907
This far out, he must be huge in this month.

27:35.381 --> 27:37.941
Eat them, fish. Eat them.

27:38.117 --> 27:40.051
Please eat them.

27:40.320 --> 27:42.254
How fresh they are...

27:42.422 --> 27:45.720
... and you down deep
in that cold water in the dark.

27:49.094 --> 27:50.322
Come on, now.

27:50.495 --> 27:52.395
Make another turn.

27:52.664 --> 27:55.792
Then eat them. Just smell the sardines.

27:55.968 --> 27:57.936
Then there is the tuna...

27:58.103 --> 28:00.731
... cold and hard and lovely.

28:02.441 --> 28:04.339
Come on, fish. Eat them.

28:04.507 --> 28:06.372
Don't be shy.

28:09.512 --> 28:11.207
He'll take it.

28:11.381 --> 28:13.872
God help him to take it.

28:17.454 --> 28:19.820
He can't have gone.

28:20.223 --> 28:25.023
God knows he can't have gone.
He must be making another turn.

28:25.561 --> 28:29.793
Perhaps he has been hooked before,
and he remembers part of it.

28:32.501 --> 28:35.026
He was just turning. He's going to take it.

28:35.204 --> 28:37.001
What a fish!

28:37.506 --> 28:40.303
Now he has it sideways in his mouth...

28:40.808 --> 28:42.708
... and he's going away with it.

28:44.178 --> 28:47.636
<i>As it went down, slipping lightly through
the old man's fingers... </i>

28:47.815 --> 28:50.147
<i>... he could still feel the great weight... </i>

28:50.318 --> 28:54.482
<i>... though the pressure of his thumb
and finger were almost imperceptible. </i>

28:57.859 --> 28:59.849
He's taken it.

29:00.761 --> 29:02.729
Now let him eat it.

29:03.096 --> 29:05.360
Eat it good, now, fish.

29:05.532 --> 29:07.227
Go on, eat it.

29:07.401 --> 29:11.929
Eat it until the point of the hook
goes into your heart and kills you...

29:12.572 --> 29:18.737
... then come up nice and easy
and let me put the harpoon into you.

29:23.282 --> 29:26.649
Now, are you ready?

29:27.119 --> 29:29.144
Have you been long enough at table?

29:41.099 --> 29:45.433
<i>Now the fish was struck, and the old man
could feel that he was hooked. </i>

29:46.004 --> 29:50.338
<i>Now he should run with the line or jump
or sound to the depths below... </i>

29:50.508 --> 29:52.339
<i>... but nothing happened. </i>

29:52.510 --> 29:54.977
<i>The fish just moved away slowly... </i>

29:55.145 --> 29:58.114
<i>... and the old man could not
raise him an inch. </i>

29:58.282 --> 30:01.615
<i>His line was strong
and made for heavy fish... </i>

30:01.785 --> 30:06.051
<i>... and he held it until it was so taut
that beads of water were jumping from it. </i>

30:07.424 --> 30:09.858
<i>Then the boat began to move... </i>

30:10.027 --> 30:12.621
<i>... slowly off toward the northwest. </i>

30:12.795 --> 30:16.162
<i>The old man leaned back against the pull. </i>

30:16.599 --> 30:20.763
<i>The fish moved steadily, and they
traveled slowly on the calm water. </i>

30:20.937 --> 30:24.873
<i>The other baits were still in the water, 
but there was nothing to be done. </i>

30:38.018 --> 30:39.713
This will kill him.

30:40.187 --> 30:42.985
He can't keep this up forever.

30:55.468 --> 30:59.404
<i>But four hours later, the fish was still
swimming steadily out to sea... </i>

30:59.572 --> 31:04.532
<i>... towing the skiff, and the old man
was still braced solidly. </i>

31:05.178 --> 31:08.238
<i>"What a fish to pull like that!" he thought. </i>

31:08.548 --> 31:11.380
<i>"He must have his mouth
shut tight on the wire. </i>

31:11.550 --> 31:15.680
<i>I wish I could see him only once
to know what I have against me. "</i>

31:16.188 --> 31:19.954
<i>There was no land in sight now. 
"That makes no difference, " he thought. </i>

31:20.259 --> 31:24.423
<i>"I can always come in on the glare
off the lights from Havana. "</i>

31:25.197 --> 31:29.155
It was noon when I hooked him,
and I have not yet seen him.

31:36.541 --> 31:39.066
I wish the boy was here.

31:50.120 --> 31:54.079
I'm being towed by a fish,
and I am the towing bitt.

31:54.591 --> 31:57.992
<i>"What I will do if he decides to go down, 
I don't know. </i>

31:58.361 --> 32:01.023
<i>What I'll do if he sounds
and dives, I don't know. </i>

32:01.198 --> 32:05.600
<i>I'll do something. 
There are plenty of things I can do. </i>

32:07.136 --> 32:11.072
<i>I could make the line fast, " he thought, 
"but then he could break it. </i>

32:11.707 --> 32:16.770
<i>I must hold him all I can and then
give him line when he must have it. </i>

32:17.513 --> 32:21.210
<i>Thank God he is traveling
and not going down. "</i>

32:24.886 --> 32:27.377
<i>It was cold after the sun went down... </i>

32:27.555 --> 32:33.050
<i>... and the old man's sweat dried cold
on his back and his arms and his old legs. </i>

32:33.428 --> 32:36.397
<i>"He didn't come up when the sun set, "
he thought. </i>

32:36.664 --> 32:38.894
<i>"Maybe he will come up with the moon. </i>

32:39.067 --> 32:42.092
<i>If he does not do that, maybe he will
come up with the sunrise. </i>

32:42.269 --> 32:43.736
<i>I wish I could see him. </i>

32:43.904 --> 32:47.897
<i>I wish I could see him only once
to know what I have against me. "</i>

32:48.575 --> 32:52.477
<i>Two porpoises came round the boat, 
he could hear them rolling and blowing. </i>

32:52.646 --> 32:55.637
<i>He could tell the difference between
the noise the male made... </i>

32:55.815 --> 32:58.045
<i>... and the sighing blow of the female. </i>

32:58.217 --> 32:59.912
<i>"They're good, " he thought. </i>

33:00.086 --> 33:03.020
<i>"They play and make jokes
and love one another. </i>

33:03.188 --> 33:05.782
<i>They are our brothers, like the flying fish. "</i>

33:07.893 --> 33:10.418
<i>Then he began to pity the great fish
he had hooked. </i>

33:11.062 --> 33:13.622
<i>"He is wonderful and strange, " he thought. </i>

33:13.932 --> 33:16.696
<i>"Who knows how old he is. "</i>

33:17.569 --> 33:21.334
Never have I had such a strong fish...

33:21.505 --> 33:24.099
... or one that acted so strangely.

33:24.642 --> 33:27.543
Maybe he's too wise to jump.

33:28.579 --> 33:31.275
He could ruin me with a jump.

33:32.683 --> 33:35.811
Or one quick rush.

33:37.121 --> 33:39.816
Maybe he has been hooked
many times before...

33:39.989 --> 33:42.981
... and he knows this is how
he must make his fight.

33:47.530 --> 33:50.226
He took the bait like a male.

33:51.067 --> 33:53.535
He moves like a male.

33:54.304 --> 33:56.828
There is no panic in his fight.

34:01.209 --> 34:07.273
I wonder if he has a plan
or if he's just as desperate as I am.

34:08.850 --> 34:11.944
I wish the boy was here.

34:19.226 --> 34:23.389
<i>The fish never changed his course
nor his direction all that night... </i>

34:23.563 --> 34:26.692
<i>... as far as the old man could tell
from watching the stars. </i>

34:28.034 --> 34:32.438
<i>He felt the strength of the great fish moving
steadily toward what he had chosen... </i>

34:32.606 --> 34:35.369
<i>... and he thought, 
"When once through my treachery... </i>

34:35.542 --> 34:38.601
<i>... it had been necessary for him
to make a choice... </i>

34:38.777 --> 34:41.440
<i>... his choice had been to stay
in the deep water... </i>

34:41.614 --> 34:44.639
<i>... far out beyond all snares and traps
and treacheries. </i>

34:44.818 --> 34:48.481
<i>My choice was to go there and find him
beyond all people. </i>

34:48.688 --> 34:51.088
<i>Beyond all people in the world. </i>

34:51.257 --> 34:55.351
<i>Now we are joined together
and have been since noon. </i>

34:55.860 --> 34:58.694
<i>And no one to help either one of us. "</i>

35:54.215 --> 35:58.811
<i>"I have lost 200 fathoms of good line
and hooks and leaders, " he thought. </i>

35:59.687 --> 36:01.450
<i>"That can be replaced. </i>

36:01.623 --> 36:06.356
<i>But who replaces this fish
if I hook some fish and it cuts him off?</i>

36:07.828 --> 36:11.423
<i>I don't know what the fish was
that took the bait just now. </i>

36:11.598 --> 36:16.058
<i>Could have been a marlin or a broadbill
or a shark. I never felt him. </i>

36:16.236 --> 36:19.296
<i>I had to get rid of him too fast. "</i>

36:37.890 --> 36:41.155
<i>"I wonder what he made that lurch for, "
he thought. </i>

36:41.327 --> 36:44.625
<i>"The wire must have slipped
on the great hill of his back. </i>

36:44.796 --> 36:48.630
<i>Certainly his back cannot
feel as badly as mine does... </i>

36:48.800 --> 36:51.735
<i>... and he cannot pull this skiff forever... </i>

36:51.903 --> 36:54.929
<i>... no matter how strong he is. "</i>

37:05.516 --> 37:08.178
<i>"Please, God, let him jump. </i>

37:09.520 --> 37:14.287
<i>Maybe if I can increase the tension a little
more, it will hurt him, and he will jump. </i>

37:14.925 --> 37:18.759
<i>Let him jump so that he will fill the sacs
along his backbone with air... </i>

37:18.929 --> 37:22.227
<i>... and then he cannot go deep to die. "</i>

37:23.633 --> 37:27.467
Fish, I love you
and I respect you very much...

37:27.637 --> 37:31.767
... but I will kill you
before this day ends.

37:35.078 --> 37:38.479
<i>A small bird came toward the skiff
from the north. </i>

37:38.648 --> 37:42.048
<i>He was a warbler
and flying very low over the water. </i>

37:42.818 --> 37:45.878
<i>And the old man could see
that he was very tired. </i>

37:49.757 --> 37:51.554
Hey...

37:51.726 --> 37:53.694
... how old are you?

37:54.929 --> 37:56.419
Is this your first trip?

37:57.598 --> 37:59.428
Why are you so tired?

38:01.401 --> 38:04.165
What are birds coming to anyway?

38:04.337 --> 38:07.534
<i>"The hawks, " he thought, 
"that come out to sea to meet them. "</i>

38:07.707 --> 38:11.803
<i>But he said nothing of this to the bird, 
who could not understand him anyway... </i>

38:11.978 --> 38:14.674
<i>... and who'd learn about the hawks
soon enough. </i>

38:14.848 --> 38:16.941
It is all right, small bird.

38:17.116 --> 38:19.710
You rest for a minute.

38:19.885 --> 38:23.719
But then you must go in, and you must
take your chances like every man...

38:23.889 --> 38:26.858
... and every fish and every bird must do.

38:29.895 --> 38:34.594
I wish I could hoist my sail and take you in
with the small breeze that's rising...

38:34.767 --> 38:36.996
... but I'm with a friend.

38:52.550 --> 38:54.813
Something hurt him.

38:58.222 --> 39:01.089
You're feeling it now, fish.

39:03.393 --> 39:05.953
And so, God knows, am I.

39:20.543 --> 39:25.606
<i>"How did I let the fish cut me with one pull
he made?" the old man thought. </i>

39:25.781 --> 39:27.544
<i>"I must be getting very stupid. </i>

39:27.717 --> 39:30.481
<i>I better pay attention to my work. </i>

39:30.653 --> 39:36.147
<i>And then I must eat the bonito
so I will not have a failure of strength. </i>

39:37.459 --> 39:42.863
<i>I wish the boy was here to cut up
the bonito, and I wish I had some salt. </i>

39:44.366 --> 39:47.767
<i>I don't think I can eat an entire one. "</i>

40:08.455 --> 40:11.218
What kind of a hand is that?

40:20.565 --> 40:22.658
Go on. Cramp if you want to.

40:22.834 --> 40:26.292
Make yourself into a claw.
It will do you no good.

40:37.081 --> 40:39.481
I must eat the bonito...

40:39.650 --> 40:42.210
... not to lose my strength.

40:43.220 --> 40:47.053
Do not blame the hand.
It is not the hand's fault.

40:47.223 --> 40:51.626
And you have been a long time
with fish.

41:23.825 --> 41:25.816
How do you feel, hand?

41:25.993 --> 41:27.927
Or is it too early to know?

41:31.265 --> 41:34.200
Maybe it will open with the sun.

41:36.104 --> 41:38.971
If I have to open it, I will open it.

41:39.140 --> 41:42.404
Cost whatever it cost.

41:42.576 --> 41:45.101
<i>"God help me to have the cramp go, "
he thought. </i>

41:45.278 --> 41:48.145
<i>"Because I don't know what the fish
is going to do. </i>

41:48.315 --> 41:52.809
<i>But he seems calm and following his plan, 
but what is his plan?</i>

41:52.986 --> 41:55.113
<i>What is mine?</i>

41:55.288 --> 42:00.225
<i>Mine I must improvise to his
because of his great size. </i>

42:01.293 --> 42:04.262
<i>If he will jump, " he thought, 
"I can kill him. "</i>

42:11.237 --> 42:16.504
Hand. Come on, hand.
He's coming up. Hand.

42:36.394 --> 42:38.883
He's longer than the skiff.

42:43.633 --> 42:45.464
Oh, he's a great fish.

42:56.478 --> 43:00.175
Thank God they are not as intelligent
as we who kill them.

43:00.348 --> 43:02.179
Although they are more noble...

43:02.484 --> 43:04.349
... and more able.

43:33.980 --> 43:36.346
I wonder why he jumped.

43:37.617 --> 43:43.249
It's almost as though he jumped
just to show me how big he was.

43:49.329 --> 43:52.229
Bad news for you, fish.

44:04.243 --> 44:09.875
<i>It was getting late in the day now, and
the skiff still moved slowly and steadily. </i>

44:10.048 --> 44:11.844
<i>The old man was suffering... </i>

44:12.016 --> 44:15.713
<i>... although he did not admit
to suffering at all. </i>

44:18.856 --> 44:20.983
I am not religious...

44:21.158 --> 44:27.393
... but I will say 10 Our Fathers and
10 Hail Marys that I may catch this fish.

44:27.565 --> 44:31.364
I will also make a pilgrimage
to the Virgin of Cobre.

44:31.535 --> 44:34.003
That is a promise.

44:34.170 --> 44:38.129
"Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name. "

44:38.308 --> 44:41.744
<i>He commenced to say his prayers
mechanically. </i>

44:41.912 --> 44:45.313
<i>Sometimes he would be so tired
that he could not remember the prayer. </i>

44:45.482 --> 44:48.712
<i>Then he would say them so fast, 
they would come automatically. </i>

44:48.884 --> 44:52.945
<i>"Hail Marys are easier to say
than Our Fathers, " he thought. </i>

44:54.123 --> 44:57.490
<i>The old man felt very tired, and he knew
that the night would come soon... </i>

44:57.660 --> 44:59.890
<i>... and he tried to think of other things. </i>

45:00.362 --> 45:02.227
<i>He thought of the big leagues. </i>

45:02.398 --> 45:04.991
<i>To him, they were the gran ligas.</i>

45:05.166 --> 45:09.397
<i>And he knew that the Yankees of New York
were playing the Tigers of Detroit. </i>

45:09.570 --> 45:14.371
<i>"This is the second day now that I do not
know the results of the games, " he thought. </i>

45:16.710 --> 45:19.543
<i>Then, to give himself more confidence... </i>

45:19.713 --> 45:23.444
<i>... he remembered the time
in the tavern at Casablanca... </i>

45:24.985 --> 45:28.385
<i>... when he played the hand game
with a Negro from Cienfuegos... </i>

45:28.554 --> 45:31.751
<i>... who was the strongest man
on the docks. </i>

45:32.458 --> 45:36.292
<i>He was not an old man then, 
but he was in his prime. </i>

45:37.396 --> 45:39.830
<i>He and the Negro had gone
one day and night... </i>

45:39.999 --> 45:42.763
<i>... with their elbows on a chalked line
on the table. </i>

46:04.855 --> 46:09.315
<i>There was much betting, and the odds
changed back and forth all night... </i>

46:09.493 --> 46:12.189
<i>... and they changed the referees
every four hours... </i>

46:12.363 --> 46:14.991
<i>... so that the referee
could get some sleep. </i>

46:22.505 --> 46:24.769
<i>They fed the Negro rum. </i>

46:25.441 --> 46:29.468
<i>Once, after the rum, 
the Negro made his all-out bid. </i>

46:53.068 --> 46:56.936
<i>But the old man raised his hand
up to dead even again. </i>

46:57.572 --> 47:01.701
<i>He was sure that he had the Negro, 
who was a fine man and a great athlete... </i>

47:01.876 --> 47:03.639
<i>... beaten. </i>

47:20.994 --> 47:24.225
<i>At daylight, when bettors were asking him
to call it a draw... </i>

47:24.397 --> 47:27.230
<i>... because they had to go to work
on the docks... </i>

47:28.268 --> 47:31.998
<i>... the old man unleashed
his greatest effort. </i>

47:33.005 --> 47:36.405
<i>He knew that he had broken
the confidence of the Negro... </i>

47:36.574 --> 47:40.806
<i>... and now he finished the bout
before anyone had to go to work. </i>

47:50.121 --> 47:54.420
<i>For a long time after that, 
everyone had called him "the champion. "</i>

48:08.238 --> 48:10.763
How do you feel, fish?

48:10.941 --> 48:12.806
I feel fine.

48:12.975 --> 48:14.966
My left hand is better.

48:15.144 --> 48:17.442
Pull the boat, fish.

48:24.353 --> 48:28.585
<i>Just before it was dark, as they passed
the great island of sargasso weed... </i>

48:28.758 --> 48:32.193
<i>... that heaved and swung
as though the ocean were making love... </i>

48:32.360 --> 48:34.851
<i>... with something under
a yellow blanket... </i>

48:35.029 --> 48:37.896
<i>... his small line had been taken
by a dolphin... </i>

48:38.066 --> 48:40.626
<i>... and he had brought it into the skiff. </i>

48:48.209 --> 48:51.439
What an excellent fish dolphin is...

48:51.612 --> 48:53.637
... to eat cooked...

48:54.982 --> 48:58.315
... and what a miserable fish raw.

49:14.000 --> 49:19.199
<i>"I had better keep the fish quiet now
and not disturb him too much at sunset. </i>

49:19.372 --> 49:23.502
<i>The setting of the sun
is a difficult time for all fish. "</i>

49:28.013 --> 49:33.383
<i>It was darker now, as it becomes dark
quickly after the sun sets in September. </i>

49:33.552 --> 49:35.520
<i>The first stars were out. </i>

49:35.687 --> 49:38.918
<i>He did not know the name of Rigel, 
but he saw it... </i>

49:39.491 --> 49:44.793
<i>... and knew soon they would be out, 
and he would have all his distant friends. </i>

49:46.263 --> 49:49.198
<i>"The fish is my friend too, " he thought. </i>

49:49.366 --> 49:53.359
Never have I seen or heard
of such a fish.

49:55.738 --> 49:57.831
But I must kill him.

50:01.411 --> 50:04.846
I'm glad I do not have to kill the stars.

50:07.449 --> 50:12.182
Imagine how it would be if, every day,
a man had to try to kill the moon.

50:15.357 --> 50:17.791
The moon runs away.

50:17.960 --> 50:23.125
But think what it would be if, every day,
he had to try to kill the sun.

50:27.668 --> 50:29.829
We're born lucky.

50:43.149 --> 50:48.553
<i>"It was half a day and a night, and now
another day, and you have not slept. </i>

50:50.290 --> 50:54.522
<i>If you do not sleep, 
you might become unclear in the head. </i>

51:00.866 --> 51:03.596
<i>Rest now, old man. </i>

51:05.104 --> 51:07.868
<i>Let him do the work. </i>

51:10.142 --> 51:12.667
<i>Until it is time... </i>

51:12.845 --> 51:15.279
<i>... for your next journey. "</i>

51:15.814 --> 51:19.271
<i>He lay forward, cramping himself
against the line with his body... </i>

51:19.450 --> 51:23.079
<i>... putting all his weight on his left hand, 
and he was asleep. </i>

51:23.254 --> 51:27.953
<i>He did not dream of the lions, 
but instead, of a vast school of porpoises... </i>

51:28.126 --> 51:32.290
<i>... that stretched for eight or 10 miles, 
and it was in the time of their mating. </i>

51:32.764 --> 51:34.994
<i>And they would leap high into the air... </i>

51:35.166 --> 51:39.067
<i>... and return in the same hole they
made in the water when they leaped. </i>

51:39.236 --> 51:41.761
<i>Then he dreamed he was in the village, 
on his bed. </i>

51:41.939 --> 51:44.271
<i>And there was a norther, 
and he was very cold. </i>

51:44.441 --> 51:48.502
<i>And his arm was asleep because his head
had rested on it instead of a pillow. </i>

51:48.679 --> 51:51.944
<i>After that, he began to dream of
the long yellow beach... </i>

51:52.115 --> 51:54.447
<i>... and he saw the first of the lions. </i>

51:54.618 --> 51:58.314
<i>And he waited to see if there would be
more lions, and he was happy. </i>

52:00.523 --> 52:04.254
<i>Then he dreamed of the whales
that passed along this coast in the fall. </i>

52:04.427 --> 52:09.296
<i>And of their mating too, and of their
friendliness with each other, and their play. </i>

52:28.048 --> 52:31.779
<i>The moon had been up for a long time, 
but he slept on. </i>

52:31.952 --> 52:36.945
<i>And the fish pulled on steadily, 
and the boat moved into a tunnel of clouds. </i>

52:37.123 --> 52:42.584
<i>He woke with a jerk of his fist coming up, 
and the line burning out through his hand. </i>

53:02.414 --> 53:04.712
This is what we waited for.

53:05.417 --> 53:07.749
Now let us take it.

53:08.253 --> 53:12.018
Make him pay for the line.
Make him pay for it.

54:39.840 --> 54:43.742
<i>"I will show him what a man can do
and what a man endures, " he thought. </i>

54:54.018 --> 54:56.418
<i>The thousand times he had proved it
meant nothing. </i>

54:56.588 --> 54:58.579
<i>Now he was proving it again. </i>

54:58.756 --> 55:00.917
<i>Each time was a new time... </i>

55:01.092 --> 55:04.424
<i>... and he never thought about the past
when he was doing it. </i>

55:05.629 --> 55:09.429
<i>"If the boy were here, he could wet
the coils of the line, " he thought. </i>

55:09.600 --> 55:13.559
<i>"Yes, if the boy were here, 
if the boy were here. "</i>

55:56.578 --> 55:59.808
<i>"Now he has jumped and filled
the sacs along his back with air. </i>

55:59.980 --> 56:02.574
<i>Now he cannot go down deep to die. </i>

56:02.750 --> 56:07.119
<i>He will start circling soon, 
then I must start working on him. "</i>

56:11.926 --> 56:14.861
Well, you didn't do so badly...

56:15.729 --> 56:18.219
... for something that is worthless.

56:22.135 --> 56:24.626
Now I have done my best.

56:26.172 --> 56:28.640
He will begin to circle soon.

56:29.709 --> 56:31.870
Let the fight come.

56:40.752 --> 56:45.951
<i>The sun was rising for the third time
since he had put out to sea. </i>

56:46.124 --> 56:50.322
<i>The fish was circling slowly, 
and the old man was wet with sweat... </i>

56:50.495 --> 56:53.692
<i>... and tired deep into his bones. </i>

57:01.405 --> 57:04.602
I could not fail myself now...

57:04.775 --> 57:08.142
... and die on a fish like this.

57:08.746 --> 57:13.579
Now that I have him coming so beautifully,
God help me to endure.

57:14.116 --> 57:19.179
I will say 100 Our Fathers
and 100 Hail Marys.

57:20.756 --> 57:23.384
But I cannot say them now.

57:25.427 --> 57:28.362
Please consider them said.

57:30.299 --> 57:32.198
I will say them later.

57:35.303 --> 57:38.670
<i>For an hour, he had been seeing spots
before his eyes. </i>

57:38.840 --> 57:41.866
<i>Twice he had felt faint and dizzy... </i>

57:42.043 --> 57:43.943
<i>... and that had worried him. </i>

57:44.579 --> 57:47.514
<i>Then suddenly, he saw a dark shadow... </i>

57:47.682 --> 57:51.777
<i>... that took so long to pass the boat
that he couldn't believe its length. </i>

57:54.488 --> 57:56.149
He can't be that big.

58:02.329 --> 58:03.990
<i>But he was that big. </i>

58:09.602 --> 58:11.263
<i>He felt faint again. </i>

58:11.437 --> 58:13.530
<i>"I moved him, " he thought. </i>

58:13.706 --> 58:16.504
<i>"Maybe this time I can get him over. "</i>

58:16.676 --> 58:18.439
Pull, hands.

58:18.611 --> 58:20.374
Hold on, legs.

58:35.327 --> 58:38.854
<i>"I must get him alongside this time, "
the old man thought. </i>

58:40.865 --> 58:43.333
Next time I'll pull him over.

58:49.473 --> 58:51.100
<i>He tried it once more. </i>

58:51.275 --> 58:54.608
<i>And he felt himself going
when he turned the fish. </i>

58:54.778 --> 58:59.943
<i>"I will try it again, " the old man promised, 
and he could only see well in flashes. </i>

59:08.424 --> 59:12.360
Fish, you're going to die anyway.
Do you have to kill me too?

59:20.069 --> 59:25.506
<i>He took all his pain and what was left
of his strength and his long-gone pride... </i>

59:25.674 --> 59:28.837
<i>... and he put it against the fish's agony. </i>

59:34.549 --> 59:38.610
<i>"I must get him close, close, "
he thought. </i>

59:38.787 --> 59:42.551
<i>"I mustn't try for the head, 
I must get the heart. "</i>

01:00:16.755 --> 01:00:20.087
Now I have killed this fish
who was my brother.

01:00:21.025 --> 01:00:23.721
Now I must do the slave work.

01:00:25.663 --> 01:00:27.893
Get to work, old man.

01:00:36.507 --> 01:00:40.203
<i>The old man did not need a compass
to tell him where southwest was. </i>

01:00:40.377 --> 01:00:43.505
<i>He only needed the feel of the trade wind
and drawing of the sail. </i>

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:45.147
<i>He could see the fish. </i>

01:00:45.315 --> 01:00:48.807
<i>And he had only to look at his hands
and feel his back against the stern... </i>

01:00:48.985 --> 01:00:51.920
<i>... to know this had truly happened
and was not a dream. </i>

01:00:52.923 --> 01:00:55.084
<i>"The hands cure quickly, " he thought. </i>

01:00:55.258 --> 01:00:59.353
<i>"I've bled them clean. 
The salt water will heal them. </i>

01:00:59.528 --> 01:01:02.986
<i>The dark water of the gulf
is the greatest healer that there is. "</i>

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.299
<i>Then his head started to become unclear, 
and he asked himself:</i>

01:01:08.471 --> 01:01:11.998
<i>"Is he bringing me in, 
or am I bringing him in?"</i>

01:01:13.409 --> 01:01:16.809
<i>They were sailing together, 
lashed side by side. </i>

01:01:16.978 --> 01:01:21.972
<i>And the old man thought, 
"Let me bring him in, if it pleases him. </i>

01:01:22.817 --> 01:01:27.686
<i>I am only better than him through trickery, 
and he meant me no harm. "</i>

01:01:27.856 --> 01:01:29.289
<i>They sailed well. </i>

01:01:29.457 --> 01:01:32.949
<i>The old man soaked his hands in the water
and tried to keep his head clear. </i>

01:01:33.127 --> 01:01:37.085
<i>He looked at the fish constantly
to make sure it was true. </i>

01:01:37.931 --> 01:01:41.367
<i>It was an hour
before the first shark hit him. </i>

01:01:45.572 --> 01:01:47.870
<i>He was a very big mako shark... </i>

01:01:48.041 --> 01:01:51.807
<i>... built to swim as fast
as the fastest fish of the sea. </i>

01:01:56.983 --> 01:02:00.077
<i>Now he speeded up
as he smelled the fresher scent... </i>

01:02:00.253 --> 01:02:03.313
<i>... and his blue dorsal fin cut the water. </i>

01:02:04.390 --> 01:02:08.155
<i>When the old man saw him coming, 
he knew this shark had no fear at all... </i>

01:02:08.326 --> 01:02:11.419
<i>... and would do exactly what he pleased. </i>

01:02:21.872 --> 01:02:23.669
It's too good to be true.

01:02:23.841 --> 01:02:25.934
Might just as well have been a dream.

01:02:33.283 --> 01:02:34.545
Mako.

01:03:21.462 --> 01:03:26.125
Now my fish bleeds again,
and there will be others.

01:03:28.268 --> 01:03:30.668
It was too good to be true.

01:03:37.110 --> 01:03:39.601
<i>The old man did not look
at the fish anymore... </i>

01:03:39.779 --> 01:03:41.713
<i>... since it had been mutilated. </i>

01:03:42.182 --> 01:03:47.813
<i>When the fish had been hit, 
it was as if he himself had been hit. </i>

01:03:47.987 --> 01:03:50.888
<i>"But I killed the shark that hit my fish, "
he thought. </i>

01:03:51.056 --> 01:03:53.923
<i>"He was the biggest dentuso
I have ever seen. </i>

01:03:54.093 --> 01:03:56.391
<i>It was too good to last. "</i>

01:03:56.562 --> 01:03:59.429
<i>He knew that each of the jerking bumps
of the shark... </i>

01:03:59.598 --> 01:04:01.532
<i>... had been meat torn away... </i>

01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:05.032
<i>... and that the fish now made
a trail of blood for all sharks... </i>

01:04:05.203 --> 01:04:07.865
<i>... as wide as a highway through the sea. </i>

01:04:12.143 --> 01:04:14.941
<i>He knew quite well the pattern
of what could happen... </i>

01:04:15.113 --> 01:04:17.775
<i>... when he reached the inner part
of the current... </i>

01:04:17.949 --> 01:04:20.713
<i>... but there was nothing to be done now. </i>

01:04:20.885 --> 01:04:23.148
<i>"Yes, there is, " he thought. </i>

01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:27.313
<i>"I can lash my knife
to the butt of one of the oars. "</i>

01:04:28.392 --> 01:04:31.326
<i>"I should've brought a stone for the knife, "
he thought. </i>

01:04:31.494 --> 01:04:35.430
<i>"You should've brought many things, 
but did not. Now is no time to think... </i>

01:04:35.598 --> 01:04:39.193
<i>... of what you do not have. Think what
you can do with what you have. "</i>

01:04:39.368 --> 01:04:42.825
<i>"You give me good counsel, " he thought. 
"I'm tired of it. "</i>

01:05:04.291 --> 01:05:07.852
I am still an old man,
but I will not be unarmed.

01:05:57.041 --> 01:05:58.804
<i>Come on, galanos!</i>

01:06:01.011 --> 01:06:03.445
<i>Come on. Come on, galanos!</i>

01:06:11.088 --> 01:06:12.749
Come on. Come on.

01:08:49.569 --> 01:08:52.163
I went out too far, fish.

01:08:52.439 --> 01:08:55.203
No good for you, nor for me.

01:08:55.809 --> 01:08:58.140
I'm sorry, fish.

01:09:25.569 --> 01:09:28.662
I still have almost half of him left.

01:09:28.906 --> 01:09:32.841
Maybe I will have the luck to bring
that much of him in.

01:09:33.010 --> 01:09:35.136
I should have some luck.

01:09:35.313 --> 01:09:37.178
No.

01:09:37.348 --> 01:09:41.783
No, you violated your luck
when you went too far out.

01:09:45.654 --> 01:09:47.555
Don't be silly.

01:09:48.992 --> 01:09:51.551
Stay awake and steer.

01:09:52.629 --> 01:09:55.530
You still may have some luck.

01:10:00.135 --> 01:10:02.569
I would like to buy some...

01:10:02.838 --> 01:10:05.500
... if there is a place where they sell it.

01:10:07.176 --> 01:10:09.667
What would I buy it with?

01:10:09.912 --> 01:10:12.574
A lost harpoon? A broken knife?

01:10:12.748 --> 01:10:14.716
Two bad hands?

01:10:14.883 --> 01:10:16.850
You might.

01:10:18.619 --> 01:10:21.452
You tried to buy it with 84 days...

01:10:22.056 --> 01:10:23.614
... at sea.

01:10:23.791 --> 01:10:26.783
They almost sold it to you too.

01:10:29.330 --> 01:10:32.299
Must not think such nonsense.

01:10:34.735 --> 01:10:39.570
Luck is a thing that comes in many forms.

01:10:39.873 --> 01:10:42.341
Who can recognize her?

01:10:46.913 --> 01:10:50.144
I wish I could see the lights of Havana.

01:10:51.785 --> 01:10:54.810
I wish for too many things.

01:10:57.590 --> 01:11:00.718
But that is what I wish now.

01:11:09.702 --> 01:11:13.728
<i>He saw the reflected glare of the light
of the city at around 10:00 at night. </i>

01:11:13.905 --> 01:11:15.770
<i>He was stiff and sore now... </i>

01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:20.001
<i>... and his wounds and all of
the strained parts of his body hurt. </i>

01:11:21.346 --> 01:11:26.147
<i>He could not talk to the fish anymore, 
because the fish had been ruined too badly. </i>

01:11:27.018 --> 01:11:29.747
<i>Then something came into his head. </i>

01:11:31.789 --> 01:11:33.552
Half fish.

01:11:33.891 --> 01:11:35.688
Fish that you were.

01:11:38.095 --> 01:11:41.531
I am sorry I went out too far.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.366
Ruined us both.

01:11:47.871 --> 01:11:50.895
But we have killed many sharks,
you and I...

01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:54.334
... and ruined many more.

01:11:56.878 --> 01:11:59.210
How many have you ever killed, old fish?

01:12:01.116 --> 01:12:04.847
You do not have that spear for nothing.

01:12:09.290 --> 01:12:12.987
<i>"What will you do now if they come
in the night?" he thought. </i>

01:12:14.128 --> 01:12:18.428
What will I do if they come in the night?

01:12:20.267 --> 01:12:22.326
I'll fight them.

01:12:22.503 --> 01:12:25.369
I'll fight them until I die.

01:12:25.538 --> 01:12:29.235
<i>"Oh, but I hope I do not
have to fight again, " he thought. </i>

01:12:29.409 --> 01:12:32.970
<i>"I hope so much I do not
have to fight again. "</i>

01:12:45.791 --> 01:12:49.249
<i>But he fought again, and this time
he knew the fight was useless. </i>

01:12:55.167 --> 01:12:56.566
Come on.

01:12:57.236 --> 01:12:58.601
Come on!

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:04.405
Come on.

01:13:22.359 --> 01:13:24.156
<i>Come on, galanos!</i>

01:13:25.729 --> 01:13:28.289
<i>Come on, galanos! Come on.</i>

01:13:32.169 --> 01:13:35.297
<i>Come on, galanos! Come on!</i>

01:13:56.792 --> 01:14:01.592
<i>He knew he was beaten now, 
finally and without remedy. </i>

01:14:04.232 --> 01:14:05.995
I'm sorry, fish.

01:14:50.909 --> 01:14:53.343
<i>He could feel he was inside
the current now... </i>

01:14:53.511 --> 01:14:56.911
<i>... and he could see the lights
of the beach colonies along the shore. </i>

01:14:57.081 --> 01:15:00.414
<i>He knew where he was now, 
and it was nothing to get home. </i>

01:15:00.584 --> 01:15:02.984
<i>"The wind is our friend anyway, "
he thought. </i>

01:15:03.153 --> 01:15:05.553
<i>Then he added, "Sometimes. "</i>

01:15:05.723 --> 01:15:10.751
<i>"And the great sea with our friends
and our enemies and bed. </i>

01:15:10.928 --> 01:15:14.522
<i>Bed is my friend, just bed. </i>

01:15:14.831 --> 01:15:16.628
<i>Bed will be a great thing. "</i>

01:15:18.935 --> 01:15:21.460
It is easy when you are beaten.

01:15:23.439 --> 01:15:25.304
What beat you?

01:15:26.476 --> 01:15:30.071
Nothing. I just went out too far.

01:15:36.285 --> 01:15:39.311
Man is not made for defeat.

01:15:41.323 --> 01:15:45.487
Man can be destroyed,
but not defeated.

01:15:56.470 --> 01:15:58.131
<i>It was quiet in the harbor. </i>

01:15:58.306 --> 01:16:01.537
<i>And he sailed up onto the little patch
of shingle below the rocks. </i>

01:16:01.709 --> 01:16:04.007
<i>There was no one to help him. </i>

01:16:04.278 --> 01:16:07.679
<i>He unstepped the mast, 
furled the sail... </i>

01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:10.480
<i>... shouldered the mast, 
and started to climb. </i>

01:16:10.650 --> 01:16:15.952
<i>It was then he knew
the depth of his tiredness. </i>

01:17:37.132 --> 01:17:41.193
<i>He had to sit down five times
before he reached the shack. </i>

01:17:49.877 --> 01:17:51.606
<i>In the morning, 
it was blowing so hard... </i>

01:17:51.779 --> 01:17:53.542
<i>... that the boats
would not be going out. </i>

01:17:53.714 --> 01:17:57.775
<i>And the boy had slept late and then
had come to the old man's shack... </i>

01:17:57.951 --> 01:18:01.317
<i>... as he had come each morning
while the old man was gone. </i>

01:18:05.391 --> 01:18:09.623
<i>The old man was asleep, 
and the boy saw that he was breathing. </i>

01:18:16.235 --> 01:18:20.000
<i>And then he saw the old man's hands, 
and he started to cry. </i>

01:18:48.132 --> 01:18:52.899
<i>He went out to bring some coffee, and
all the way down the road, he was crying. </i>

01:19:04.180 --> 01:19:08.843
<i>Many fishermen were around the skiff, 
looking at what was beside it. </i>

01:19:09.017 --> 01:19:12.851
<i>And one was in the water, his trousers
rolled up, measuring the skeleton... </i>

01:19:13.021 --> 01:19:15.580
<i>... preparing to take off
the head and the bill. </i>

01:19:15.756 --> 01:19:17.690
<i>The boy did not go down. </i>

01:19:17.859 --> 01:19:19.827
<i>He had been there before. </i>

01:19:24.432 --> 01:19:25.797
Martin.

01:19:25.967 --> 01:19:28.731
A can of coffee with plenty of milk
and sugar in it.

01:19:28.903 --> 01:19:30.700
What a fish that was.

01:19:30.872 --> 01:19:33.602
There has never been such a fish.

01:19:33.773 --> 01:19:36.207
Those were two fine fish
you took yesterday.

01:19:36.376 --> 01:19:38.901
Never mind about my fish.

01:19:39.446 --> 01:19:41.004
Does he want a drink of any kind?

01:19:41.181 --> 01:19:43.945
No. If he does, I'll be back.

01:19:44.284 --> 01:19:46.479
You tell him how sorry I am.

01:19:46.653 --> 01:19:48.518
Thanks.

01:19:49.789 --> 01:19:51.154
I'll get the coffee.

01:21:10.465 --> 01:21:13.525
They beat me, Manolin.
They truly beat me.

01:21:14.169 --> 01:21:17.536
He didn't beat you, not the fish.

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:20.967
Did you suffer much?

01:21:23.478 --> 01:21:25.968
Now we'll fish together again.

01:21:26.146 --> 01:21:28.239
No, no.

01:21:28.782 --> 01:21:30.807
I am not lucky anymore.

01:21:30.985 --> 01:21:34.351
The hell with luck.
I'll bring the luck with me.

01:21:36.389 --> 01:21:40.189
- What will your father say?
- I don't care what he says.

01:21:43.663 --> 01:21:45.459
We'll...

01:21:45.831 --> 01:21:50.598
We will have to get a killing lance
and keep it onboard at all times.

01:21:50.802 --> 01:21:52.861
It must be very sharp...

01:21:53.038 --> 01:21:57.634
... and not tempered so it will break,
like my knife broke.

01:21:57.809 --> 01:21:59.640
I'll get another knife.

01:21:59.811 --> 01:22:02.041
How many days of heavy wind have we?

01:22:03.781 --> 01:22:06.978
Oh, maybe three. Maybe more.

01:22:07.151 --> 01:22:08.948
I'll have everything in order.

01:22:09.587 --> 01:22:12.818
You get your hands well, old man.

01:22:15.226 --> 01:22:18.491
They will be all right in a couple of days.

01:22:19.030 --> 01:22:21.021
I know how to care for them.

01:22:21.865 --> 01:22:24.698
During the night, I spat up
something strange.

01:22:24.868 --> 01:22:28.634
I felt like something
in my chest was broken.

01:22:29.005 --> 01:22:30.905
Get that well too.

01:22:31.074 --> 01:22:33.804
Drink your coffee. I'll get you
something to eat.

01:22:34.177 --> 01:22:39.171
And... And bring me the papers
from the time I was away.

01:22:39.482 --> 01:22:41.005
I will.

01:23:19.986 --> 01:23:24.082
<i>That afternoon there was a party
of tourists from Havana at a cafÃ©. </i>

01:23:24.257 --> 01:23:26.919
<i>One of them looked down, 
and among the empty beer cans... </i>

01:23:27.094 --> 01:23:30.928
<i>... and dead barracuda, she saw the long
backbone of the great fish... </i>

01:23:31.098 --> 01:23:35.194
<i>... that was now just garbage
waiting to go out with the tide. </i>

01:23:37.670 --> 01:23:39.934
<i>"What's that?" she asked the waiter. </i>

01:23:40.306 --> 01:23:42.331
<i>"TiburÃ³n, " the waiter said. "A shark. "</i>

01:23:42.508 --> 01:23:45.966
<i>He was trying to explain
what had happened to the marlin. </i>

01:23:46.545 --> 01:23:51.676
<i>"I didn't know sharks had such handsome, 
beautifully formed tails, " the woman said. </i>

01:23:51.851 --> 01:23:55.013
<i>"I didn't either, "
her male companion answered. </i>

01:24:00.591 --> 01:24:04.083
<i>Up the road in his shack, 
the old man was sleeping again. </i>

01:24:04.561 --> 01:24:09.464
<i>He was still sleeping on his face, and
the boy was sitting by him, watching him. </i>

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.162
<i>The old man was dreaming about the lions. </i>
