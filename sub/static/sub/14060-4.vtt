00:01.234 --> 00:02.568
Previously on
when calls the heart...

00:02.570 --> 00:04.303
Why does the company
feel the need

00:04.305 --> 00:05.571
To send its spies
even to a Sunday school?

00:05.573 --> 00:06.972
Because clearly

00:06.974 --> 00:08.507
Some people in this town
don't trust each other.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.676
Cat montgomery
is drawing a crowd

00:10.678 --> 00:12.511
In a grove of trees.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.313
Perhaps I should put her
on the payroll.

00:14.315 --> 00:17.349
If you won't meet their needs,

00:17.351 --> 00:18.684
They will flock
to someone who will.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.486
Someone burned down my church
six weeks ago.

00:20.488 --> 00:23.188
[jack]: I wonder
if you, uh, happened to know

00:23.190 --> 00:24.223
What this can is.

00:24.225 --> 00:25.224
It's whale oil.

00:53.987 --> 00:56.655
I see you've found
my supply of whale oil.

00:56.657 --> 00:59.391
Yes, ma'am.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.427
I was just curious.

01:01.429 --> 01:03.495
You don't see it
used very often these days.

01:03.497 --> 01:05.831
You don't see it at all <i>,</i>
<i>as a matter of fact.</i>

01:05.833 --> 01:06.932
I have to have that

01:06.934 --> 01:08.500
Specially ordered.

01:08.502 --> 01:10.169
For your...
For your candle-making?

01:10.171 --> 01:12.404
Yes.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.506
Yeah, it's a little
side business I started

01:14.508 --> 01:16.875
After I lost my husband.

01:18.311 --> 01:19.812
I still have
three mouths to feed.

01:19.814 --> 01:22.815
His death pension,
it only goes so far.

01:22.817 --> 01:25.651
It must be a challenge,

01:25.653 --> 01:28.220
Caring for three children
on your own.

01:29.823 --> 01:31.857
Yes, it can be stressful.

01:31.859 --> 01:33.859
Guess it might
make a person angry, too.

01:35.028 --> 01:36.862
I'm not sure
I catch your meaning.

01:36.864 --> 01:39.565
Do you remember
a special vigil six weeks ago

01:39.567 --> 01:40.599
At the mine?

01:41.734 --> 01:43.268
Of course.

01:43.270 --> 01:46.205
It was for the men
lost in the explosion.

01:46.207 --> 01:47.840
But you chose not to attend.

01:49.342 --> 01:53.645
I chose to grieve
my husband privately.

01:53.647 --> 01:56.281
That's no secret
to people who know me.

01:56.283 --> 01:58.450
Or to those who marked that

01:58.452 --> 02:00.319
As the same night
the church burned down.

02:02.755 --> 02:05.090
Well, you can tell
the dear reverend

02:05.092 --> 02:07.593
I did not
set fire to his church.

02:10.730 --> 02:13.699
Mrs. Montgomery,

02:13.701 --> 02:16.635
Can you explain how a can
of this very same whale oil

02:16.637 --> 02:17.636
Might have ended up

02:17.638 --> 02:19.705
In the remains
of the building?

02:19.707 --> 02:22.341
Whale oil?

02:22.343 --> 02:24.710
It was used
to burn down the church?

02:24.712 --> 02:26.678
It appears so.

02:29.482 --> 02:32.351
Are you accusing me
of arson, constable?

02:34.487 --> 02:36.421
Not accusing.

02:36.423 --> 02:39.525
Just...
Just asking a few questions.

02:42.495 --> 02:44.263
Mind if I
hang onto this can?

02:44.265 --> 02:45.230
Be my guest.

02:56.376 --> 03:00.312

03:06.352 --> 03:08.020

Good morning,

03:58.505 --> 03:59.538
Miss thatcher,

03:59.540 --> 04:00.806
My ma asked

04:00.808 --> 04:02.507
If you could come by
today after school,

04:02.509 --> 04:04.109
She said
it's real important.

04:04.111 --> 04:05.110
Sure.

04:05.112 --> 04:06.411
Tell her I'll be there.

04:09.716 --> 04:10.882
Come on, pockets.

04:10.884 --> 04:12.951
Dump 'em out
and show me what you got.

04:12.953 --> 04:14.953
My name's not pockets.

04:14.955 --> 04:16.755
Sure it is, pockets.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.824
Now, either you empty 'em out,
or I'll do it for ya.

04:26.132 --> 04:27.432
That's it?

04:27.434 --> 04:28.533
That's all you got?

04:28.535 --> 04:29.201
Everything all right
here, albert?

04:29.203 --> 04:30.102
Miss thatcher!

04:30.104 --> 04:32.638
I was just, uh...

04:32.640 --> 04:34.106
Helping him
pick all this up.

04:34.108 --> 04:35.674
Well, isn't that nice.

04:35.676 --> 04:37.676
Since you're feeling
so eager to help,

04:37.678 --> 04:38.810
Why don't you plan on
staying after school

04:38.812 --> 04:40.579
To help me
clean the classroom.

04:40.581 --> 04:41.613
I was just
funnin' him,

04:41.615 --> 04:42.614
Right, pockets?

04:42.616 --> 04:44.816
I mean, albert.

04:44.818 --> 04:46.818
Oh, I know exactly
what you were doing,

04:46.820 --> 04:48.053
Which is why I'll make sure

04:48.055 --> 04:48.987
Cleaning is extra fun
for you, too.

04:58.998 --> 05:00.666
You have a wonderful eye
for treasures, albert.

05:03.036 --> 05:05.037
If your classmates give you
any more trouble,

05:05.039 --> 05:06.204
You'll come to me?

05:06.206 --> 05:07.939
Yes, ma'am.

05:07.941 --> 05:08.940
All right.

05:20.486 --> 05:22.521
[sighs dreamily]

05:29.062 --> 05:30.929
How could jack thornton

05:30.931 --> 05:33.131
Believe anything
so ridiculous?

05:33.133 --> 05:34.766
So he hasn't said
anything to you?

05:34.768 --> 05:35.801
No,

05:35.803 --> 05:36.935
But now I understand

05:36.937 --> 05:39.071
Why he was so rude
to me yesterday.

05:40.506 --> 05:42.140
I'll admit,

05:42.142 --> 05:43.342
After what happened
at the mine,

05:43.344 --> 05:46.278
I was angry
enough at god

05:46.280 --> 05:48.246
To want to
burn down a church,

05:48.248 --> 05:50.082
But I swear,
I didn't do it.

05:51.984 --> 05:53.952
Where do you think all this
suspicion is coming from?

05:53.954 --> 05:55.587
Apparently,

05:55.589 --> 05:57.889
Constable thornton found
a burned can of my whale oil

05:57.891 --> 05:59.157
In the wreckage of the church.

05:59.159 --> 06:01.126
Whale oil?

06:01.128 --> 06:02.627
That's absurd.

06:02.629 --> 06:03.829
When I was a child,

06:03.831 --> 06:05.063
My father used that
on his boats.

06:05.065 --> 06:07.699
Mostly, it just smokes
and stinks to high heaven.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.301
Well, that may be, but...

06:09.303 --> 06:12.003
He thinks it started the fire.

06:12.005 --> 06:13.739
And as far as I know,

06:13.741 --> 06:15.540
I'm the only one in town
who uses it.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.042
Still,

06:17.044 --> 06:18.610
Anyone who thinks
you're an arsonist

06:18.612 --> 06:20.045
Needs his head examined,

06:20.047 --> 06:21.980
Including constable thornton.

06:21.982 --> 06:24.249
I just wish I could
get rid of this feeling

06:24.251 --> 06:27.452
That something bad
is gonna happen.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.512
What are you doing up?

06:53.514 --> 06:54.946
I can't sleep.

06:54.948 --> 06:56.214
Why not?

06:56.216 --> 06:58.049
What's an arsonist?

06:58.051 --> 07:00.685
Somebody that burns things.

07:00.687 --> 07:03.155
Why are you asking about that?

07:03.157 --> 07:05.891
I heard mommy
and miss thatcher talking.

07:05.893 --> 07:06.958
She said

07:06.960 --> 07:08.326
That mountie jack thinks

07:08.328 --> 07:09.995
She used that stinky whale oil

07:09.997 --> 07:11.163
And that started
the church fire.

07:13.232 --> 07:14.232
I'm scared, gabe.

07:14.234 --> 07:15.934
What if they
take mama away?

07:29.916 --> 07:32.517
[door opens]

07:35.121 --> 07:36.688
Constable.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.290
Mr. Gowen.

07:38.292 --> 07:39.191
I believe you know
mr. Spurlock,

07:39.193 --> 07:40.225
My head of security.

07:40.227 --> 07:41.426
Oh, yeah,

07:41.428 --> 07:42.327
We've crossed paths
a few times.

07:42.329 --> 07:43.295
Thank you.

07:43.297 --> 07:44.863
If we were
any closer in age,

07:44.865 --> 07:46.798
We might even have
crossed paths at the academy.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.366
You were a mountie?

07:48.368 --> 07:50.068
No, I never
let it get that far.

07:50.070 --> 07:51.670
Decided halfway
through training

07:51.672 --> 07:53.772
To get a real job
with the pinkerton agency.

07:55.341 --> 07:57.042
I hear tell

07:57.044 --> 07:58.376
That you're intent
on reopening an investigation

07:58.378 --> 07:59.411
Into the church fire.

07:59.413 --> 08:00.345
I wouldn't go
that far.

08:00.347 --> 08:02.247
It still could be an accident.

08:02.249 --> 08:03.815
I will say that I've found
some new information

08:03.817 --> 08:05.116
That needs looking into.

08:05.118 --> 08:06.084
Looks like you're
testing soil samples,

08:06.086 --> 08:07.018
Am I right?

08:08.788 --> 08:10.255
I'll let you know
when I know.

08:10.257 --> 08:12.257
And what I know,

08:12.259 --> 08:14.125
Is that a church
bought and paid for

08:14.127 --> 08:16.061
By the pacific northwest
mining company

08:16.063 --> 08:18.196
Was burnt to the ground
a month after a mine disaster.

08:18.198 --> 08:20.065
That, to me,

08:20.067 --> 08:21.199
Seems suspicious.

08:21.201 --> 08:22.901
Gabe?

08:22.903 --> 08:24.402
Is it true you think my mama
burned down the church?

08:24.404 --> 08:25.904
We should, uh...

08:25.906 --> 08:27.739
We should talk
about this later.

08:27.741 --> 08:28.940
No!

08:28.942 --> 08:30.141
I want to know the truth.

08:34.780 --> 08:39.050
Truth is,
I'm asking her some questions.

08:39.052 --> 08:40.919
For now,
that's all.

08:40.921 --> 08:42.787
Can you promise me
she ain't a suspect?

08:43.923 --> 08:45.891
No.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.759
No, unfortunately, I can't.

08:51.264 --> 08:53.298
[whispering]
if you try to take from us,

08:53.300 --> 08:55.033
I swear to god, I'll fight you.

09:05.344 --> 09:07.412
I don't envy your
position, constable,

09:07.414 --> 09:08.980
But if you believe
that the montgomery woman

09:08.982 --> 09:11.850
Is a suspect,

09:11.852 --> 09:13.485
Why haven't you
arrested her yet?

09:13.487 --> 09:15.387
Unlike mr. Spurlock's
original investigation,

09:15.389 --> 09:17.923
I'd like to be
more thorough

09:17.925 --> 09:19.057
Before I accuse a widow
with three children

09:19.059 --> 09:20.091
Of a felony.

09:20.093 --> 09:23.228
So we understand one another,

09:23.230 --> 09:26.898
If she indeed is the culprit,

09:26.900 --> 09:28.400
I want her behind bars

09:28.402 --> 09:30.001
Until she sit before
a magistrate.

09:30.003 --> 09:32.604
What's she going to do, run?

09:32.606 --> 09:36.841
If she's guilty,
why wouldn't she?

09:36.843 --> 09:40.145
I don't know what she'd do
under the circumstances,

09:40.147 --> 09:42.213
But this is
a company town,

09:42.215 --> 09:44.182
And I need
to maintain order,

09:44.184 --> 09:45.550
Or the entire system
falls apart.

09:45.552 --> 09:48.520
We can't have citizens
running around,

09:48.522 --> 09:51.289
Doling out their own sense
of warped justice,

09:51.291 --> 09:54.159
On that we can agree,
can we not?

09:58.931 --> 10:00.065
We can.

10:13.879 --> 10:15.313
Reverend.

10:15.315 --> 10:17.048
Mrs. Montgomery.

10:20.019 --> 10:21.686
Thank god, elizabeth found
that little girl.

10:21.688 --> 10:23.088
Yes, indeed.

10:23.090 --> 10:24.923
It is a blessing
to have rosaleen back.

10:24.925 --> 10:27.826
Well, that's
one mystery solved.

10:39.405 --> 10:41.573
Use your imaginations.

10:41.575 --> 10:42.874
Think what it must have
been like

10:42.876 --> 10:44.476
For simon fraser and his men

10:44.478 --> 10:49.214
Out there all winter long,
so far from home.

10:52.551 --> 10:54.452
Can you tell me about
your picture, rosaleen?

10:54.454 --> 10:56.488
It's what the explorers saw

10:56.490 --> 10:58.490
When they finally got
over the mountain.

10:58.492 --> 11:00.225
Do you like it?

11:00.227 --> 11:02.227
It's beautiful.

11:02.229 --> 11:03.128
Just like the sound
of your voice.

11:22.448 --> 11:24.082
[door opens]

11:24.084 --> 11:27.052
Apologies for
the interruption.

11:27.054 --> 11:28.186
I just need
a minute of your time.

11:30.189 --> 11:31.489
It's important.

11:34.393 --> 11:36.161
Keep working on
your drawings, boys and girls.

11:36.163 --> 11:37.162
I'll only be a moment.

11:42.435 --> 11:44.035
I hope you have a good reason

11:44.037 --> 11:45.270
For interrupting
my class, constable.

11:45.272 --> 11:47.038
I'm sorry,

11:47.040 --> 11:48.373
But I needed to talk with you,
and it couldn't wait.

11:49.475 --> 11:50.842
So you now you have time
to talk to me?

11:50.844 --> 11:52.310
I was just trying to help cat.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.379
By accusing her of arson?

11:54.381 --> 11:56.881
No, by trying to eliminate
her as a suspect,

11:56.883 --> 12:00.318
But it is not
proving easy.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.087
Then try using
some common sense.

12:02.089 --> 12:03.354
What makes you think

12:03.356 --> 12:04.556
It couldn't have just
been an accident?

12:04.558 --> 12:05.957
I'm not
ruling that out completely,

12:05.959 --> 12:07.292
But there is

12:07.294 --> 12:09.594
Damaging evidence
against her, elizabeth.

12:09.596 --> 12:11.329
Certainly, you can't think

12:11.331 --> 12:12.997
She would jeopardize
her children's welfare

12:12.999 --> 12:14.499
By doing something so foolish.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.801
That's why I need your help.

12:20.072 --> 12:21.840
I'd like to ask her children
a few questions.

12:22.641 --> 12:24.175
No. No...

12:24.177 --> 12:25.310
Look, there's not
a soul in town

12:25.312 --> 12:26.377
That can vouch for
cat's whereabouts

12:26.379 --> 12:27.412
The night of the fire.

12:27.414 --> 12:30.115
Maybe her children can,

12:30.117 --> 12:31.583
But if she is
in the room with them,

12:31.585 --> 12:32.917
I can't verify
her story legally.

12:32.919 --> 12:34.853
Absolutely not.

12:36.088 --> 12:37.255
[sighs]

12:37.257 --> 12:38.356
Elizabeth...

12:39.525 --> 12:41.326
Listen to me,

12:41.328 --> 12:44.262
She could be
in a lot of trouble.

12:46.165 --> 12:47.632
If you want me
to have any chance

12:47.634 --> 12:49.167
Of ruling her out as a suspect,

12:49.169 --> 12:52.003
I'm going to need your help.

12:55.241 --> 12:56.474
[talking quietly]
did you think she was angry?

12:56.476 --> 12:57.408
Yes.

12:59.945 --> 13:01.646
Miss thatcher,
are we in trouble?

13:01.648 --> 13:03.248
Of course not.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.550
Mountie jack just wants to
as you a few questions.

13:05.552 --> 13:07.085
That's all.

13:07.087 --> 13:08.620
Why can't he ask us
all at the same time?

13:09.688 --> 13:10.722
Well...

13:10.724 --> 13:13.191
I suppose
we should think of it

13:13.193 --> 13:14.726
As a little game
he likes to play.

13:14.728 --> 13:17.962
Doesn't seem like
a very fun game.

13:19.665 --> 13:21.232
Gabe?

13:27.373 --> 13:29.174
Your brother,

13:29.176 --> 13:31.209
He said he didn't know
where your mother went

13:31.211 --> 13:32.510
The night the church burned.

13:32.512 --> 13:35.246
Is that your
understanding, too?

13:35.248 --> 13:38.516
All she said was
she wanted to be alone,

13:38.518 --> 13:41.085
But that don't make her
no arsonist.

13:41.087 --> 13:45.023
The three of you,
you went to the vigil anyway,

13:45.025 --> 13:46.257
Without your mother?

13:46.259 --> 13:48.393
She sent us
with abigail stanton.

13:48.395 --> 13:49.994
So what?

13:49.996 --> 13:51.229
Okay.

13:51.231 --> 13:54.265
Was she at home
when you got back?

13:55.568 --> 13:57.268
No.

13:57.270 --> 13:59.137
She didn't get in till late
after we had gone to bed.

13:59.139 --> 14:02.607
Abigail stayed with us
until she got there.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.609
That's all I know.

14:06.345 --> 14:08.346
Are we done yet?

14:09.682 --> 14:10.915
Yes.

14:13.485 --> 14:14.586
Hello, emily.

14:14.588 --> 14:17.622
Take a seat.

14:24.563 --> 14:27.732
Now, I have a few things
I'm trying to figure out.

14:27.734 --> 14:29.067
Do you think you can help me?

14:29.069 --> 14:30.134
I'll try.

14:30.136 --> 14:31.202
Good.

14:31.204 --> 14:34.472
Do you remember

14:34.474 --> 14:37.408
A special memorial service
a while back?

14:37.410 --> 14:39.377
With lots of pretty candles

14:39.379 --> 14:41.479
And stories about the men
who got hurt in the mine?

14:41.481 --> 14:42.647
Like my daddy?

14:44.016 --> 14:45.483
Yeah.

14:45.485 --> 14:48.820
Yeah, like your daddy.

14:48.822 --> 14:51.489
But your mommy,
she didn't go to that service,

14:51.491 --> 14:52.724
Did she?

14:52.726 --> 14:53.958
Uh-uh.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.727
Do you know why?

14:55.729 --> 14:58.229
Uh-uh.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.431
I wonder
where she went instead?

15:00.433 --> 15:01.699
I don't know.

15:01.701 --> 15:04.102
When she came home
the next morning,

15:04.104 --> 15:05.503
I asked her,

15:05.505 --> 15:07.772
But she was just
too tired to tell me.

15:07.774 --> 15:09.240
Wait,

15:09.242 --> 15:11.476
You mean when she got home
late that night?

15:11.478 --> 15:12.577
No.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.312
The sun was up
when she came in,

15:14.314 --> 15:16.481
And mommy got
in bed with me.

15:16.483 --> 15:20.151
Emily, are you sure?

15:20.153 --> 15:21.452
Think really hard.

15:21.454 --> 15:24.222
Uh-huh, the rooster
was crowing, too.

15:24.224 --> 15:25.256
Huh.

15:26.392 --> 15:28.126
Well, thank you.

15:28.128 --> 15:29.894
Thank you so much
for helping me.

15:29.896 --> 15:32.297
Would you mind waiting outside
with your brothers?

15:36.435 --> 15:38.903
Did I get all the answers
right, miss thatcher?

15:38.905 --> 15:40.238
The truth
is always right, emily.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.606
You did just fine.

15:49.548 --> 15:50.748
Cat's hiding something.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.317
Later that night
or the next morning,

15:52.319 --> 15:53.885
What does it matter?

15:53.887 --> 15:57.055
Apparently, it matters enough
for her to lie about it,

15:57.057 --> 15:59.290
And it is my job
to find out why.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.359
Well, I'm going along.

16:01.361 --> 16:03.861
I don't think so.

16:03.863 --> 16:07.265
Your authority ends
in the classroom.

16:07.267 --> 16:08.967
If you're going to
wrongly interrogate

16:08.969 --> 16:10.601
An innocent woman
and friend of mine,

16:10.603 --> 16:12.537
I'm going to be there.

16:12.539 --> 16:14.339
[jack]: Mrs. Montgomery,

16:14.341 --> 16:16.874
This is your last chance
to tell me the truth.

16:16.876 --> 16:18.309
Both your boys say

16:18.311 --> 16:19.210
You told them
you came home late

16:19.212 --> 16:20.478
The night of the vigil,

16:20.480 --> 16:22.380
But emily says it wasn't
till the next morning.

16:22.382 --> 16:24.482
Which was it?

16:24.484 --> 16:27.652
I didn't burn
the church, jack.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.687
I have a perfectly good
explanation of where I was...

16:30.990 --> 16:31.923
Ma?

16:31.925 --> 16:33.758
Why is he here?

16:33.760 --> 16:35.460
Go back inside, gabe, please.

16:35.462 --> 16:38.796
No, not until you tell me
what's going on.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.201
Can you watch them, please?

16:43.203 --> 16:44.469
Of course.

16:44.471 --> 16:45.837
Okay.

16:45.839 --> 16:47.872
You guys, go back inside
with miss thatcher, okay?

16:47.874 --> 16:49.907
She's going to help you
with your homework.

16:49.909 --> 16:50.908
Come on, let's
get out your readers...

16:50.910 --> 16:52.210
Gabe, you too.

16:52.212 --> 16:53.311
No.

16:59.418 --> 17:01.319
I-I'm sorry, constable.

17:01.321 --> 17:02.987
I am not at liberty
to discuss this right now.

17:02.989 --> 17:05.189
In that case, we can
continue this discussion

17:05.191 --> 17:06.457
At my office

17:06.459 --> 17:08.292
If that's
the way you want it.

17:09.328 --> 17:10.294
You're arresting her?

17:11.830 --> 17:13.998
Just take it easy, gabe.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.501
I'm just taking her in
to ask her some questions.

17:16.503 --> 17:17.568
It's okay.

17:17.570 --> 17:18.903
No!

17:18.905 --> 17:19.937
You're trying
to arrest her.

17:19.939 --> 17:21.472
You can't do this!

17:21.474 --> 17:22.907
I hate you.

17:22.909 --> 17:23.975
Gabriel, please, stop.

17:23.977 --> 17:25.643
Stop! I need you
to listen to me!

17:25.645 --> 17:27.245
No, ma, you didn't do anything!

17:27.247 --> 17:28.212
Don't go with him!

17:28.214 --> 17:29.747
I know, I just...

17:29.749 --> 17:31.382
I just have to answer some of
his questions, all right?

17:31.384 --> 17:33.785
And right now, I need for you
to be a grown-up.

17:33.787 --> 17:36.721
To be strong, okay?

17:40.492 --> 17:42.293
All right.

17:42.295 --> 17:43.561
Okay?

17:57.776 --> 17:59.544
I will ride out immediately
to check out your story.

17:59.546 --> 18:03.414
If it does, this
will be short-lived.

18:03.416 --> 18:04.816
I promise.

18:06.885 --> 18:08.252
So you still don't believe me?

18:10.556 --> 18:12.857
One of the pinkertons
will watch things here

18:12.859 --> 18:14.592
While I'm gone.

18:14.594 --> 18:15.560
Which one?

18:17.429 --> 18:18.362
Does it matter?

18:21.066 --> 18:22.400
The only thing
that matters to me

18:22.402 --> 18:23.801
Is getting home to my children.

18:35.881 --> 18:37.482
[door closes]

18:46.692 --> 18:48.526
[♪]

19:00.272 --> 19:01.973
This is from cat.

19:04.042 --> 19:05.610
It's for
her children.

19:05.612 --> 19:08.346
You arrested
an innocent woman

19:08.348 --> 19:09.480
In front of her son.

19:09.482 --> 19:10.748
Why, jack?

19:10.750 --> 19:13.084
I gave her
every opportunity to talk.

19:13.086 --> 19:14.418
She didn't talk to me

19:14.420 --> 19:15.820
Until we got back
to the jailhouse.

19:15.822 --> 19:18.489
I'm about to leave town
to verify her story.

19:18.491 --> 19:19.957
It may exonerate her.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.826
Then why arrest her
in the first place?

19:21.828 --> 19:23.895
Why not just give her
the benefit of the doubt?

19:23.897 --> 19:24.762
Because
I have a responsibility

19:24.764 --> 19:26.964
To treat everyone equally,

19:26.966 --> 19:28.766
Whether it be
catherine montgomery

19:28.768 --> 19:29.634
Or henry gowen.

19:29.636 --> 19:31.035
She didn't do it.

19:31.037 --> 19:32.703
You may be right,

19:32.705 --> 19:34.972
But you'd be surprised
what people are capable of

19:34.974 --> 19:35.907
When they're hurting,

19:35.909 --> 19:38.743
Or when they're angry.

19:38.745 --> 19:41.445
Now, I hope
that's not the case.

19:41.447 --> 19:42.947
I hope to verify her story,

19:42.949 --> 19:46.484
But I just need you
to be patient.

19:46.486 --> 19:48.619
Trust me.

19:48.621 --> 19:50.254
Just let me do my job.

19:54.393 --> 19:56.027
Then don't let me keep you.

20:08.106 --> 20:10.374
These don't look right.

20:10.376 --> 20:12.543
What is it?

20:12.545 --> 20:14.412
They're your
mother's biscuits.

20:14.414 --> 20:15.980
I followed
her recipe exactly.

20:15.982 --> 20:18.449
I wish mommy was here.

20:18.451 --> 20:20.117
Her biscuits wouldn't
make a sound.

20:20.119 --> 20:22.520
Well, here.

20:22.522 --> 20:23.788
Maybe you can soften them up
with some gravy.

20:23.790 --> 20:24.922
Or a sledgehammer.

20:27.359 --> 20:28.326
All right...

20:30.095 --> 20:31.462
Here we are.

20:34.933 --> 20:36.434
[all gasping]

20:37.970 --> 20:39.971
Oh, children, I'm so sorry.

20:39.973 --> 20:41.572
[coughing]

20:41.574 --> 20:43.641
I ain't hungry.

20:43.643 --> 20:45.743
What's the point
of eating anyway?

20:50.182 --> 20:52.750
All right, children,
that's all for today.

20:52.752 --> 20:55.519
You may be dismissed.

20:55.521 --> 20:58.489
Don't forget
to do your homework!

21:18.910 --> 21:20.077
Albert...

21:22.114 --> 21:24.081
What's wrong?

21:24.083 --> 21:25.349
Nothin's wrong, ma'am.

21:26.418 --> 21:29.887
It's just...

21:29.889 --> 21:31.922
I've got a little
something for you.

21:38.030 --> 21:39.764
[sighs]

21:39.766 --> 21:41.999
Good heavens.

21:42.001 --> 21:43.768
Don't you like it?

21:45.837 --> 21:46.671
It's beautiful.

21:48.040 --> 21:51.075
And far too expensive.

21:51.077 --> 21:53.477
Albert, I'm so sorry,
but I can't accept this.

21:53.479 --> 21:54.779
Why not?

21:55.814 --> 21:58.015
Because it's too much.

21:58.017 --> 21:59.417
Where did you get this?

22:01.553 --> 22:03.421
Well, I, um...

22:04.890 --> 22:06.190
Please,
just tell me the truth.

22:06.192 --> 22:10.161
I found it when I was
fishing in the creek.

22:10.163 --> 22:11.062
I snagged it.

22:12.664 --> 22:14.265
I can't imagine

22:14.267 --> 22:17.201
Who could be so careless.

22:17.203 --> 22:20.137
I think it might have
been mr. Spurlock.

22:20.139 --> 22:21.205
Might?

22:21.207 --> 22:24.108
Well, he told me if I found it,

22:24.110 --> 22:26.444
He'd trade me
a pen knife for it.

22:26.446 --> 22:28.913
He knows

22:28.915 --> 22:31.148
They all call me "pockets,"

22:31.150 --> 22:33.184
And how I like to find stuff
and to keep it.

22:33.186 --> 22:35.986
Mr. Spurlock, the pinkerton?

22:35.988 --> 22:37.655
Yes, ma'am.

22:37.657 --> 22:39.023
I guess he saw me watching him
over by the creek,

22:39.025 --> 22:41.826
And he told me
that the necklace

22:41.828 --> 22:42.893
Fell out of his pocket,

22:42.895 --> 22:44.895
And how he lost it.

22:44.897 --> 22:46.630
I guess I should've
given it to him,

22:46.632 --> 22:49.700
But I mean,
I already have a pocket knife.

22:49.702 --> 22:52.470
And it's just so pretty.

22:53.905 --> 22:54.905
And you're so pretty.

23:01.113 --> 23:04.081
I appreciate your generosity,

23:04.083 --> 23:06.183
I really do,

23:06.185 --> 23:10.588
But I'm sure mr. Spurlock
misses this very much.

23:10.590 --> 23:13.224
Why don't I return it to him
and set his mind at ease?

23:13.226 --> 23:15.926
It's just...

23:15.928 --> 23:18.295
I knew you used to be rich,

23:18.297 --> 23:20.664
So when I found it,

23:20.666 --> 23:22.099
I thought you'd appreciate it.

23:24.236 --> 23:25.870
May I let you in
on a little secret, albert?

23:27.239 --> 23:30.875
Girls don't care
if a gift is fancy,

23:30.877 --> 23:32.643
Not even girls
who used to be rich.

23:32.645 --> 23:33.611
Really?

23:34.846 --> 23:39.216
What we care about are gifts
that come from the heart.

23:42.120 --> 23:44.088
Like this one.

23:44.090 --> 23:45.523
I made that!

23:46.792 --> 23:48.626
So you clearly don't need
my advice.

23:48.628 --> 23:49.860
You already know

23:51.997 --> 23:53.631
You are going to make
some young lady

23:53.633 --> 23:55.166
Very happy one day,

23:55.168 --> 23:57.034
Just like this bird made me.

24:15.954 --> 24:16.987
Pretzels, gingerbread,
beef jerky.

24:16.989 --> 24:18.756
Looks like
you're having a party.

24:18.758 --> 24:20.291
Our mommy's in jail.

24:20.293 --> 24:23.160
We're gonna go
visit her before dinner.

24:23.162 --> 24:24.261
I'm sorry,

24:24.263 --> 24:26.263
I hadn't heard.

24:26.265 --> 24:27.364
Mountie jack thinks

24:27.366 --> 24:28.933
Mommy burned down
the church,

24:28.935 --> 24:31.001
But we know
she didn't.

24:31.003 --> 24:32.069
She deserves something
to cheer her up.

24:32.071 --> 24:33.103
I agree.

24:33.105 --> 24:35.873
Add a dozen licorice sticks.

24:36.875 --> 24:37.842
Yeah, certainly, yeah.

24:39.010 --> 24:42.279
Oh, miss thatcher,
we just heard about cat.

24:42.281 --> 24:43.280
It's just
unimaginable.

24:43.282 --> 24:44.815
Yes, it is.

24:44.817 --> 24:46.717
I'm sure it'll all
be straightened out soon,

24:46.719 --> 24:48.319
And she'll be back home
where she belongs.

24:48.321 --> 24:49.286
Of course she will.

24:53.191 --> 24:54.625
Such a shame.

24:54.627 --> 24:56.026
Those poor children.

24:56.028 --> 24:58.062
All those sundays,
I sat in her bible class,

24:58.064 --> 24:59.730
And she was
the fire-starter.

24:59.732 --> 25:01.031
It just, it takes
my breath away.

25:01.033 --> 25:02.333
I just, I can't believe
that she would do this.

25:02.335 --> 25:03.801
Writing's on the wall.

25:03.803 --> 25:05.169
She's the only one
any of us remember

25:05.171 --> 25:06.370
Not being at the vigil.

25:06.372 --> 25:08.205
[gasps] shh.

25:13.278 --> 25:14.178
Gabe?

25:16.915 --> 25:18.082
Gabe!

25:20.151 --> 25:21.151
Hey, gabe!

25:21.153 --> 25:22.086
You can't
go back there!

25:22.088 --> 25:23.721
You did it, didn't you?

25:23.723 --> 25:24.822
Please, just
give us moment?

25:24.824 --> 25:25.756
You burned down

25:25.758 --> 25:27.291
That church.

25:27.293 --> 25:28.259
That's why you wouldn't
say nothin' in front of us!

25:28.261 --> 25:29.360
We'll just excuse ourselves.

25:29.362 --> 25:30.895
We'll be prayin'

25:30.897 --> 25:33.063
This all gets
sorted out real quick.

25:33.065 --> 25:34.665
Okay, thank you
for coming.

25:34.667 --> 25:36.400
Tell me, ma!

25:36.402 --> 25:38.102
Did you burn down that church?

25:38.104 --> 25:41.605
Gabriel, you know I would
never do a thing like that!

25:42.774 --> 25:45.409
Then why are you lying?

25:45.411 --> 25:48.078
I know that this
is difficult for you.

25:48.080 --> 25:49.880
I just need for you
to trust me

25:49.882 --> 25:52.182
A little while
longer, okay?

25:58.256 --> 26:01.325
[door slams]

26:08.333 --> 26:10.200
How are you still pink?

26:10.202 --> 26:11.869
You should not
still be pink.

26:11.871 --> 26:12.903
Cook!

26:12.905 --> 26:14.104
Just don't burn on me again...

26:15.240 --> 26:16.974
[knock on door]

26:16.976 --> 26:18.409
Just a minute!

26:22.847 --> 26:23.948
Coming!

26:27.419 --> 26:28.886
Good evening, miss thatcher.

26:28.888 --> 26:30.988
Reverend anderson,
please come in.

26:35.493 --> 26:36.894
I just came by
to find out

26:36.896 --> 26:38.362
How the children
are holding up.

26:38.364 --> 26:40.764
As well as can be expected,

26:40.766 --> 26:43.467
Although, obviously,
they need their mother home.

26:43.469 --> 26:45.035
I understand.

26:45.037 --> 26:46.236
Cat and I may have
our differences,

26:46.238 --> 26:47.471
But when it comes to

26:47.473 --> 26:48.405
The welfare
of these youngsters,

26:48.407 --> 26:49.840
That's another
matter entirely.

26:49.842 --> 26:51.175
[thumping and arguing upstairs]

26:51.177 --> 26:52.376
Give it back!
Now!

26:52.378 --> 26:55.446
[thumping and shouting]

26:55.448 --> 26:56.747
Oh, dear, I had better--

26:56.749 --> 26:57.815
I can come back another time.

26:57.817 --> 26:59.049
Excuse me.

27:02.253 --> 27:03.954
Have you been
praying for us, sir?

27:05.523 --> 27:06.790
Of course I have, child.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.425
Thank you.

27:10.495 --> 27:12.329
[children fighting upstairs]

27:12.331 --> 27:13.330
I'd best go.

27:20.338 --> 27:23.107
Boys, come here!

27:26.011 --> 27:27.244
That's enough.

27:28.380 --> 27:29.813
Miss thatcher,

27:29.815 --> 27:31.348
I found mommy's necklace.

27:33.518 --> 27:36.420
Oh, you must be confused,
sweetheart.

27:36.422 --> 27:38.589
This necklace
belongs to someone else.

27:38.591 --> 27:40.257
I was going to
return it tomorrow.

27:40.259 --> 27:42.926
No, the man who wanted
to marry mommy gave it to her,

27:42.928 --> 27:45.396
After daddy died.

27:45.398 --> 27:46.997
Who wanted to marry mommy?

27:46.999 --> 27:48.298
Mr. Spurlock.

27:56.875 --> 27:59.510
I thought I'd seen
the last of this.

28:02.280 --> 28:03.447
Why didn't you
say something

28:03.449 --> 28:06.450
About you and
mr. Spurlock earlier?

28:06.452 --> 28:08.252
I didn't think
it was important.

28:10.655 --> 28:13.991
His interest in a relationship
was far greater than mine.

28:15.860 --> 28:17.361
Cat...

28:17.363 --> 28:19.430
Yesterday, jack accused you
of hiding something,

28:19.432 --> 28:20.431
And I defended you.

28:24.302 --> 28:26.437
[sighs]

28:26.439 --> 28:28.806
Well, I guess you're going to
know the truth soon enough.

28:30.875 --> 28:31.942
Please.

28:36.581 --> 28:39.349
My husband, joe, was a...

28:39.351 --> 28:41.418
A good man, elizabeth.

28:41.420 --> 28:45.355
He was
a wonderful father.

28:47.225 --> 28:50.394
But he made...

28:50.396 --> 28:52.262
Mistakes.

28:52.264 --> 28:53.664
He had a weakness,

28:53.666 --> 28:55.432
One that he was
terribly ashamed of,

28:55.434 --> 28:57.534
One that the children
didn't know about.

28:57.536 --> 28:58.569
No one knew about it.

28:58.571 --> 28:59.536
I don't understand.

28:59.538 --> 29:02.506
He liked to, uh...

29:03.641 --> 29:05.075
Gamble.

29:07.645 --> 29:09.480
He played cards
with some men

29:09.482 --> 29:10.481
The next town over.

29:10.483 --> 29:12.449
Oftentimes, he would win,

29:12.451 --> 29:16.220
But more often, he would lose.

29:16.222 --> 29:22.426
He kept chasing that big win
that would get out of debt.

29:22.428 --> 29:26.363
There was no talking to him.

29:26.365 --> 29:28.432
I couldn't keep him
from going.

29:28.434 --> 29:29.700
Oh, lord...

29:29.702 --> 29:35.973
He dug himself
in a deep, deep hole.

29:35.975 --> 29:37.274
There was a card shark,

29:37.276 --> 29:39.710
Who saw
a desperate man,

29:39.712 --> 29:43.113
And just kept giving him
more and more credit.

29:44.449 --> 29:49.153
A week after the...

29:49.155 --> 29:51.255
Mine disaster,

29:51.257 --> 29:54.191
That man showed up
looking for his money.

29:54.193 --> 29:55.793
Did you explain

29:55.795 --> 29:58.395
That your husband was gone
and couldn't repay the--

29:58.397 --> 29:59.696
He didn't care.

29:59.698 --> 30:01.031
He wanted
what he was owed.

30:01.033 --> 30:03.801
I didn't know what to do.

30:03.803 --> 30:06.003
I couldn't go to my friends,
I was too ashamed,

30:06.005 --> 30:10.641
And joe was a good man.

30:10.643 --> 30:11.942
There was no way I was gonna
let this town

30:11.944 --> 30:13.110
Think poorly of him.

30:14.445 --> 30:15.913
And how does spurlock fit in?

30:17.549 --> 30:20.217
He's the only one who knew.

30:21.953 --> 30:23.020
He played cards

30:23.022 --> 30:25.522
With the same men, with joe.

30:25.524 --> 30:27.457
He knew I was in trouble.

30:27.459 --> 30:31.028
He came to me and...

30:31.030 --> 30:33.397
Offered to help.

30:33.399 --> 30:37.167
He said he would
pay off the debt

30:37.169 --> 30:41.305
If I would just...

30:41.307 --> 30:43.006
Be friendly to him.

30:45.310 --> 30:47.077
Oh, no.

30:47.079 --> 30:48.579
[chuckles wryly]

30:48.581 --> 30:50.380
He played on my worries
for my children.

30:50.382 --> 30:52.583
He actually thought
that I was weak enough that...

30:52.585 --> 30:54.284
I'm so sorry.

30:54.286 --> 30:55.619
He tried to give me
that necklace

30:55.621 --> 30:57.354
And...

30:57.356 --> 30:59.957
Well, I was harsh in my rebuke.

30:59.959 --> 31:01.658
I was so furious.

31:01.660 --> 31:04.294
I told him I would rather
live in a tent

31:04.296 --> 31:08.298
And I would starve
before I would...

31:08.300 --> 31:11.401
I hurled that necklace
back at him so hard,

31:11.403 --> 31:14.204
It landed in the creek.

31:14.206 --> 31:17.741
He was really angry.

31:17.743 --> 31:19.109
Oh...

31:19.111 --> 31:20.410
That's why
he paid albert bickley

31:20.412 --> 31:23.614
To look for the necklace
by the creek.

31:26.251 --> 31:28.118
And what about the card shark?

31:28.120 --> 31:30.687
Well, it took a while.

31:30.689 --> 31:32.289
I used part of
joe's death pension,

31:32.291 --> 31:35.592
And I spent a lot of
sleepless nights making candles,

31:35.594 --> 31:36.693
But, finally, I paid it back,

31:36.695 --> 31:39.463
All on my own...

31:40.732 --> 31:42.266
The night of the vigil.

31:45.536 --> 31:49.106
That's where you were,
settling the debt?

31:49.108 --> 31:50.507
Yes.

31:50.509 --> 31:52.743
Jack is trying to
track down the card shark,

31:52.745 --> 31:55.345
And I pray that he will
confirm my story.

31:55.347 --> 31:56.680
I don't understand,

31:56.682 --> 31:58.615
Why didn't you say so
from the beginning?

31:58.617 --> 32:01.652
Why not just tell the truth
and avoid all this?

32:05.056 --> 32:06.456
Because I'm not the only one

32:06.458 --> 32:08.458
Who adored
my husband, elizabeth.

32:08.460 --> 32:09.459
My children...

32:11.829 --> 32:13.563
[holding back tears]

32:15.433 --> 32:17.768
My children had already
lost so much.

32:17.770 --> 32:19.603
I could not let them lose

32:19.605 --> 32:22.372
Their good memory
of their father, too.

32:22.374 --> 32:23.707
I just...

32:23.709 --> 32:24.641
I understand.

32:26.110 --> 32:27.344
But what if

32:27.346 --> 32:30.447
Jack can't
find the man?

32:30.449 --> 32:33.583
Or what if he won't
corroborate your story?

32:33.585 --> 32:36.820
He might not be
so willing to admit

32:36.822 --> 32:39.723
He pressured a widow into
repaying her husband's debt.

32:42.260 --> 32:44.194
Well, that's a risk
I'll have to take.

32:44.196 --> 32:47.064
So you would rather
keep your husband's secret,

32:47.066 --> 32:48.765
Even if it means

32:48.767 --> 32:51.068
Being prosecuted for a crime
you didn't commit?

32:52.870 --> 32:55.472
I haven't looked
that far into the future.

32:57.675 --> 32:59.142
I hope you don't have to.

33:11.756 --> 33:13.590
Mr. Spurlock?

33:15.093 --> 33:16.727
[knocking]

33:18.196 --> 33:19.529
Mr. Spurlock!

33:19.531 --> 33:21.732
It's elizabeth thatcher!

33:21.734 --> 33:23.734
Miss thatcher?

33:23.736 --> 33:26.169
What brings you
all the way out here?

33:26.171 --> 33:28.705
I came to return this.

33:30.508 --> 33:32.576
Ah.

33:32.578 --> 33:33.577
Cat montgomery.

33:34.679 --> 33:35.779
A sorry chapter
of failed love,

33:35.781 --> 33:36.780
I'm afraid.

33:36.782 --> 33:38.281
My heart's broken again

33:38.283 --> 33:39.616
To see her
in the predicament she's in

33:39.618 --> 33:41.418
For that church business.

33:41.420 --> 33:43.186
Mine too.

33:44.689 --> 33:46.289
Well, thank you
for returning this.

33:46.291 --> 33:49.459
Good day to you.

34:32.403 --> 34:34.738
[sniffs gingerly]

34:34.740 --> 34:36.673
Whale oil?

34:36.675 --> 34:38.208
You just

34:38.210 --> 34:39.676
Can't help yourself,
can you?

34:39.678 --> 34:41.178
It was you, wasn't it?

34:41.180 --> 34:44.548
You've created a problem
for me, miss thatcher.

34:44.550 --> 34:46.583
You planted
that can at the church,

34:46.585 --> 34:47.617
After the fire,

34:47.619 --> 34:49.853
To make it
look like cat.

34:49.855 --> 34:51.521
You took that can
from her shed

34:51.523 --> 34:52.556
And burned it right here.

34:52.558 --> 34:53.957
Stop talking.

34:53.959 --> 34:55.459
She's an innocent woman,
you had no right!

34:55.461 --> 34:56.426
Enough!

34:56.428 --> 34:57.894
[screams]

34:59.664 --> 35:01.198
You don't have any right

35:01.200 --> 35:03.433
To judge me.

35:03.435 --> 35:05.902
I was offering to save her
and those kids,

35:05.904 --> 35:08.004
And she spurns me?

35:08.006 --> 35:10.307
[whimpers in terror]

35:10.309 --> 35:11.575
Please, you don't
have to do this.

35:11.577 --> 35:12.442
[horse whinnies]

35:15.780 --> 35:18.014
Jack! Jack!

35:18.016 --> 35:19.416
Are you okay?

35:21.819 --> 35:23.854
[crying] jack...

35:25.389 --> 35:26.590
Did he hurt you?

35:26.592 --> 35:28.625
No, but how did you
know I was here?

35:28.627 --> 35:29.993
When I got back
to the jail,

35:29.995 --> 35:30.961
Cat told me that you were
headed to spurlock's.

35:30.963 --> 35:32.462
He's the one
who framed cat.

35:32.464 --> 35:34.865
It's over now.

35:34.867 --> 35:36.433
Come with me.

35:36.435 --> 35:39.970
"the boys...

35:39.972 --> 35:42.205
"they run..."

35:45.476 --> 35:46.309
Mama!

35:53.684 --> 35:55.952
[laughing]

35:55.954 --> 35:57.621
You're home.

35:57.623 --> 35:59.656
Hi, gabe.

36:00.758 --> 36:03.326
Ma...

36:03.328 --> 36:04.661
I'm sorry.

36:04.663 --> 36:06.696
Oh, no, no, no,
it's all right.

36:06.698 --> 36:07.631
I'm home now.

36:07.633 --> 36:08.598
That's all that matters.

36:14.572 --> 36:16.506
[sighing in relief]

36:31.055 --> 36:32.088
<i>[elizabeth writes]:</i>

36:32.090 --> 36:34.124

36:57.014 --> 37:00.784
Thank you all for your support

37:00.786 --> 37:05.689
During my recent,
shall we say, scandalous ordeal.

37:05.691 --> 37:07.691
[chuckles]

37:09.527 --> 37:12.596
I am truly glad
to be here with you today.

37:17.001 --> 37:19.603
Now, reverend anderson
had wanted to say a few words

37:19.605 --> 37:21.972
To all of us.

37:25.676 --> 37:27.711
I'll be brief,

37:27.713 --> 37:29.613
Which, as most of you know,
is against my nature.

37:29.615 --> 37:32.983
[polite chuckles]

37:32.985 --> 37:36.419
First, to cat,

37:36.421 --> 37:38.688
I ask your pardon.

37:38.690 --> 37:41.958
I accused you
of something terrible because...

37:41.960 --> 37:43.460
Frankly, I was jealous.

37:44.862 --> 37:46.863
I was angry over
losing my parishioners

37:46.865 --> 37:50.000
To your Sunday school.

37:50.002 --> 37:53.503
It turns out,
according to constable thornton,

37:53.505 --> 37:55.338
Our church likely
burned down accidentally.

37:57.541 --> 38:00.043
And yet I allowed
my suspicions

38:00.045 --> 38:02.679
To run wild.

38:03.948 --> 38:07.851
No one should behave like that,

38:07.853 --> 38:10.120
Least of all a pastor.

38:12.890 --> 38:14.724
Please forgive me.

38:20.031 --> 38:22.032
[sighs in relief]

38:24.035 --> 38:27.737
And now to all of you,

38:27.739 --> 38:30.974
Over this past many months,

38:30.976 --> 38:34.477
I have not been the pastor

38:34.479 --> 38:35.679
You needed most

38:35.681 --> 38:37.614
In this time
of trouble.

38:37.616 --> 38:39.015
Instead,

38:39.017 --> 38:42.619
I've been more concerned
of my own security,

38:42.621 --> 38:46.923
In keeping my own job,

38:46.925 --> 38:50.026
And for that, I am deeply...

38:50.028 --> 38:51.961
Deeply sorry.

38:54.865 --> 38:57.801
I can only hope

38:57.803 --> 38:59.769
That, over time,

38:59.771 --> 39:03.073
You will find it in your hearts
to forgive me.

39:05.976 --> 39:07.610
Pastor,

39:07.612 --> 39:09.179
Um...

39:09.181 --> 39:11.081
It's been a while

39:11.083 --> 39:13.550
Since many of us have
heard a sermon from you.

39:13.552 --> 39:15.051
How would you feel

39:15.053 --> 39:16.720
About leading the service
this morning?

39:19.590 --> 39:20.824
It would be my joy.

39:43.748 --> 39:45.382
Psalm 23...

39:45.384 --> 39:47.117
Thank you
for joining me

39:47.119 --> 39:49.119
For this
picnic lunch, jack.

39:49.121 --> 39:51.821
I hope it doesn't
make you uncomfortable.

39:51.823 --> 39:53.823
A free lunch never
makes me uncomfortable.

39:53.825 --> 39:55.925
I just thought
it's the least I could do

39:55.927 --> 39:57.293
To show my gratitude

39:57.295 --> 39:59.662
For that little incident
with mr. Spurlock.

40:01.165 --> 40:03.833
You mean the little incident
where I saved your life?

40:05.069 --> 40:07.170
Yes, that one.
[chuckles]

40:07.172 --> 40:09.239
No thanks necessary.

40:09.241 --> 40:12.008
I would have done the same
for any citizen of coal valley.

40:13.244 --> 40:14.277
Right.

40:14.279 --> 40:15.612
Of course, you would.

40:15.614 --> 40:16.679
I'd expect nothing less.

40:16.681 --> 40:18.081
Though having a grizzled miner

40:18.083 --> 40:20.116
With a three-day-old beard
jump into my arms

40:20.118 --> 40:22.051
Would not have been as pleasant.

40:24.822 --> 40:26.289
Hope you like
roast-beef sandwiches.

40:26.291 --> 40:29.759
Yeah, well, anything
with beef in the title

40:29.761 --> 40:32.662
Is most welcome,
thank you.

40:32.664 --> 40:35.865
To be honest, I'm not
the world's best cook.

40:35.867 --> 40:38.868
Seems I was born without
that particular talent.

40:38.870 --> 40:41.871
Perhaps you've heard
that rumor around town.

40:41.873 --> 40:43.673
No.

40:43.675 --> 40:46.176
[laughs]

40:47.578 --> 40:48.578
Sorry.

40:50.948 --> 40:54.083
It looks like we have
an uninvited guest.

40:54.085 --> 40:54.918
What?

40:54.920 --> 40:56.986
Spider.

40:56.988 --> 40:57.987
Spider?

40:57.989 --> 40:59.022
[gasps in terror]

41:00.591 --> 41:01.624
[gasping]

41:01.626 --> 41:03.560
Please?

41:11.302 --> 41:13.102
Sorry.

41:15.306 --> 41:16.272
Don't mention it.

41:20.244 --> 41:22.178
We probably shouldn't
make a habit of that.

41:22.180 --> 41:23.947
Absolutely not.

41:35.025 --> 41:38.695
[♪]
