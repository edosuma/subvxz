00:05.468 --> 00:07.102
<i>In New York
city's war on crime,</i>

00:07.103 --> 00:10.171
<i>the worst criminal offenders
are pursued</i>

00:10.172 --> 00:12.474
<i>by the detectives
of the Major Case Squad.</i>

00:12.475 --> 00:14.443
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:17.407 --> 00:20.659
- Danielle, sweetheart,
relax.

00:20.660 --> 00:23.215
Nobody's gonna take your company
away from you.

00:23.216 --> 00:25.320
- The Gaffneyss have money,
connections.

00:25.321 --> 00:28.584
- And we've got brains
and guts.

00:28.585 --> 00:30.053
No trust fund brat
gets to swoop in

00:30.054 --> 00:33.421
and take away
what we've built.

00:33.422 --> 00:34.755
Nice, Rex.

00:34.756 --> 00:35.787
Parker Gaffneys.

00:35.788 --> 00:38.423
Speak of the devil.

00:38.424 --> 00:39.926
- Enjoy yourselves
while you can,

00:39.927 --> 00:41.063
'cause the fun train is over.

00:41.064 --> 00:42.905
You're on notice.

00:42.906 --> 00:45.277
Lawyers have been hired
and they're locked and loaded.

00:45.278 --> 00:46.881
Guys, we can talk about this.

00:46.882 --> 00:48.649
Those who can't do, sue.

00:48.650 --> 00:50.118
Bring it on, Princeton.

00:50.119 --> 00:51.323
You're a thief, Danielle.

00:51.324 --> 00:53.561
- Okay, now I'm starting
to lose my chill.

00:53.562 --> 00:55.096
- A thief in a company
of thieves.

00:55.097 --> 00:56.631
Yeah, take a shot.

00:56.632 --> 00:58.335
That'll add, what, another
10 million to the lawsuit?

00:58.336 --> 00:59.537
- Guys.
- Sit down, please.

00:59.538 --> 01:01.873
- Parker, forget it.
- Guys, guys, come on.

01:01.874 --> 01:03.175
Rex, what do you need?

01:03.176 --> 01:04.711
One douchebag escorted out.

01:04.712 --> 01:05.913
Done.

01:05.914 --> 01:07.551
- You used to be such
a nice person, Danielle.

01:07.552 --> 01:10.323
You should see yourself now.

01:10.324 --> 01:11.858
I want her company eviscerated.

01:11.859 --> 01:13.360
- Theft of intellectual
property

01:13.361 --> 01:15.298
is notoriously difficult
to prove.

01:15.299 --> 01:17.801
- That's why your firm
was hired.

01:17.802 --> 01:20.606
- Then I need more than your
word against hers.

01:20.607 --> 01:23.344
I need evidence to put this
over the top.

01:23.345 --> 01:26.114
You bring me a smoking gun.

01:26.115 --> 01:27.551
- When we started this company,
it was fun.

01:27.552 --> 01:30.021
How did things get so ugly?

01:30.022 --> 01:31.824
- Money changes people,
but not us.

01:31.825 --> 01:34.294
We're still the same, right?

01:34.295 --> 01:35.896
Yes.

01:35.897 --> 01:37.298
- Look, I don't want
the Gaffneyss

01:37.299 --> 01:39.367
and that whole nightmare
to come between us.

01:39.368 --> 01:40.870
Hey, it's you two!

01:40.871 --> 01:42.705
I love your site.

01:42.706 --> 01:44.506
My fiance really loves
your site.

01:44.507 --> 01:45.541
Thanks.

01:45.542 --> 01:49.444
Thank you.

01:49.445 --> 01:50.946
Do you see?

01:50.947 --> 01:52.948
Us, the company,
it wasn't coincidence.

01:52.949 --> 01:54.616
It was destiny.

01:54.617 --> 01:57.235
And the Gaffneyss
can't fight that.

02:00.573 --> 02:02.691
- A lawsuit is a huge waste
of time.

02:02.692 --> 02:04.026
When you're spitballing ideas,

02:04.027 --> 02:05.428
who's to say who came up
with what?

02:05.429 --> 02:07.664
- That better not be what you
say in your deposition.

02:07.665 --> 02:10.201
If you let this girl
play you for a fool,

02:10.202 --> 02:13.004
you'll be sucking hind teat
for the rest of your life.

02:13.005 --> 02:14.606
That's not the Gaffneys way.

02:14.607 --> 02:16.107
- I'm not sure
she did play us.

02:16.108 --> 02:17.242
I saw the evidence.

02:17.243 --> 02:18.677
It's hardly definitive.

02:18.678 --> 02:20.045
We could spend years
in litigation

02:20.046 --> 02:21.680
wasting time and energy
that could be spent

02:21.681 --> 02:23.081
building our own company.

02:23.082 --> 02:24.983
- You're gonna let
these people screw you

02:24.984 --> 02:27.185
while you smile and say,
"thank you"?

02:27.186 --> 02:28.754
Not my son.

02:28.755 --> 02:30.188
Man up, boy.

02:30.189 --> 02:33.291
Fight or die.

02:33.292 --> 02:35.627
Quit being so soft.

02:35.628 --> 02:38.379
- I keep telling you,
the old man's right.

<b>Adriano_CSI
www.addic7ed.com</b>

04:02.637 --> 04:05.657
We got two bodies.
Janitor found them this morning.

04:05.658 --> 04:09.726
The victims are Parker
and Thomas Gaffneys.

04:09.727 --> 04:11.628
- 30.
- Brothers?

04:11.629 --> 04:12.896
Identical twins.

04:12.897 --> 04:15.465
Well, that's a first for us.

04:15.466 --> 04:16.800
That's Danielle and PJ.

04:16.801 --> 04:18.468
Kizmate.

04:18.469 --> 04:19.802
It's a dating network.

04:19.803 --> 04:21.704
- You're a subscriber?
- No.

04:21.704 --> 04:23.439
They are Internet legends.

04:23.440 --> 04:27.476
They turned $12,000
into millions.

04:27.477 --> 04:28.611
That's Parker.

04:28.612 --> 04:29.712
Parker looks like
he's got

04:29.713 --> 04:30.980
a stab wound through
the jugular.

04:30.981 --> 04:32.815
The khakis, that's Thomas.

04:32.816 --> 04:34.951
Thomas we don't know
about yet.

04:34.952 --> 04:37.121
- Security cameras
in the building?

04:37.122 --> 04:40.090
- Yeah, but they shut it down
at 7:42 last night.

04:40.091 --> 04:41.826
That's convenient.

04:41.827 --> 04:44.629
We'll need the records
on the swipe card access.

04:44.630 --> 04:47.866
Heavy perspiration.

04:47.867 --> 04:51.336
It's an unusual head wound.

04:51.337 --> 04:52.437
Semi-circular.

04:52.438 --> 04:53.571
You see the bruising
around the edges?

04:53.572 --> 04:54.938
Mmm.

04:54.939 --> 04:58.625
- Brain hemorrhage?
- Could be.

05:04.232 --> 05:09.152
The blood trail leads
over here.

05:09.153 --> 05:13.423
So Thomas' body was dragged
from the area

05:13.424 --> 05:16.442
that he was killed.

05:22.816 --> 05:27.203
Eames?

05:27.204 --> 05:29.505
Lever's bent.

05:29.506 --> 05:32.375
And, uh, it's consistent
to the wound

05:32.376 --> 05:34.044
on Thomas' head.

05:34.045 --> 05:35.845
- He was pushed into
the pinball machine,

05:35.846 --> 05:37.381
maybe during a struggle?

05:37.382 --> 05:38.582
Right.

05:38.583 --> 05:39.917
The killer might have been

05:39.918 --> 05:43.387
dragging Thomas' body away
when Parker showed up.

05:43.388 --> 05:48.092
The killer doubled down.

05:48.093 --> 05:51.495
- I have no idea what
the Gaffneyss were doing here.

05:51.496 --> 05:53.263
They didn't work for us.

05:53.264 --> 05:55.366
- But you knew them?
- Professionally.

05:55.367 --> 05:57.434
They ran
a venture capital firm.

05:57.435 --> 05:59.402
- Were they investors
in Kizmate?

05:59.403 --> 06:00.570
No.

06:00.571 --> 06:01.671
Then why would they be here?

06:01.672 --> 06:02.839
I told you.

06:02.840 --> 06:04.373
I don't know why
they were here.

06:04.374 --> 06:07.743
- Maybe they subscribed
to your dating service.

06:07.744 --> 06:09.212
We're not a hook-up service.

06:09.213 --> 06:11.347
And we're not Facebook.

06:11.348 --> 06:13.083
We're a networking site
dedicated

06:13.084 --> 06:15.318
to romantic connectivity.

06:15.319 --> 06:16.520
To Kismet.

06:16.521 --> 06:18.923
- Right, fate, destiny,
from the turkish.

06:18.924 --> 06:21.159
- Isn't that how you met
your partner?

06:21.160 --> 06:24.329
- I had developed
an application,

06:24.330 --> 06:28.100
but I didn't know
what it was good for.

06:28.101 --> 06:30.468
Then two years ago,
I dropped my wallet

06:30.469 --> 06:33.338
near the gapstow bridge
in central park.

06:33.339 --> 06:34.406
PJ found it.

06:34.407 --> 06:35.873
He was cute.

06:35.874 --> 06:37.908
He was wearing
a blue knit cap.

06:37.909 --> 06:41.211
But before I could get his name,
he was gone.

06:41.212 --> 06:46.215
- So you used your application
to blast a message to him,

06:46.216 --> 06:47.850
to the boy in the blue cap?

06:47.851 --> 06:49.152
Yes.

06:49.153 --> 06:50.920
We've been together ever since.

06:50.921 --> 06:54.558
- And then you turned this
into a website?

06:54.559 --> 06:58.596
- PJ and I just wanted
to give others the chance

06:58.597 --> 07:01.432
to make their own happiness.

07:01.433 --> 07:04.603
And now this-this-

07:04.604 --> 07:06.372
bad luck.

07:06.373 --> 07:09.075
Or destiny.

07:09.076 --> 07:10.510
I don't know.

07:10.511 --> 07:13.012
I'm just a geek code writer
who had one good idea.

07:13.013 --> 07:14.914
That's all.

07:14.915 --> 07:16.783
Danielle magee is a thief.

07:16.784 --> 07:20.653
Kizmate was my boys' idea.

07:20.654 --> 07:22.922
They pitched it to her
two years ago.

07:22.923 --> 07:25.358
- We weren't
aware of that.

07:25.359 --> 07:29.161
- Thomas had the idea
to create an application

07:29.162 --> 07:33.298
that allowed people
to trace chance encounters.

07:33.299 --> 07:37.102
He and Parker met with Danielle
to develop it.

07:37.103 --> 07:41.440
My boys.

07:41.441 --> 07:43.909
- We're very sorry
for your loss.

07:43.910 --> 07:48.514
- You fenced
with your son?

07:48.515 --> 07:50.349
Thomas or Parker?
- Uh, Parker.

07:50.350 --> 07:54.921
Thomas enjoyed
more benign pursuits.

07:54.922 --> 07:55.922
Right.

07:55.923 --> 07:57.690
Different personalities.

07:57.691 --> 07:59.459
Yes.

07:59.460 --> 08:02.629
You know, miss magee,

08:02.630 --> 08:04.631
she told us that
she came up

08:04.632 --> 08:07.301
with the Kizmate application
on her own.

08:07.302 --> 08:08.635
- No, maybe the mechanics
of it,

08:08.636 --> 08:11.605
but it was my sons' idea.

08:11.606 --> 08:13.440
Then she ran with it
all the way to the bank.

08:13.441 --> 08:15.876
They were suing her.

08:15.877 --> 08:19.113
- Did you see or speak
with your sons last night?

08:19.114 --> 08:22.016
- I had dinner with Thomas
at the university club.

08:22.017 --> 08:25.286
- Did he mention going
to the Kizmate office later?

08:25.287 --> 08:28.556
- No, but he did get
a phone call after 10:00.

08:28.557 --> 08:29.724
Uh, he said he had to leave.

08:29.725 --> 08:31.325
Some business emergency.

08:31.326 --> 08:33.928
"Business emergency."

08:33.929 --> 08:36.196
Who else would know what
that might have been?

08:36.197 --> 08:39.782
- Their business partner,
samir doss, he would know.

08:43.253 --> 08:46.038
- No, I don't know
what emergency Thomas

08:46.039 --> 08:47.940
was talking about,
and no,

08:47.941 --> 08:49.575
I have no idea
why he and Parker

08:49.576 --> 08:51.043
were at the Kizmate office.

08:51.044 --> 08:53.679
- But you do have an idea
about the lawsuit.

08:53.680 --> 08:55.882
- Two years ago,
we approached Danielle

08:55.883 --> 08:58.552
to write code for our site.

08:58.553 --> 09:00.520
We had a couple of meetings.

09:00.521 --> 09:05.008
She seemed decent, honest...
Very smart.

09:06.678 --> 09:09.464
Six months later,
she launched Kizmate.

09:09.465 --> 09:10.799
Our idea.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.500
You confronted her?

09:12.501 --> 09:16.905
- We asked for a fair share-
tens of millions of dollars

09:16.906 --> 09:17.906
she didn't want to pay.

09:17.907 --> 09:20.342
- Any chance she
might have arranged

09:20.343 --> 09:22.010
to meet with the Gaffneyss
last night

09:22.011 --> 09:23.413
to discuss a settlement?

09:23.414 --> 09:24.948
- Well, I'd like to think
they wouldn't meet her

09:24.949 --> 09:26.816
without telling me first.

09:26.817 --> 09:28.684
- But she knew
that you were suing her?

09:28.685 --> 09:30.119
Most definitely.

09:30.120 --> 09:31.887
Two nights ago,
I was with Parker

09:31.888 --> 09:33.256
and we ran into Danielle
at a nightclub.

09:33.257 --> 09:38.927
He told her our lawyers
were locked and loaded.

09:38.928 --> 09:41.696
That's how Parker talked.

09:41.697 --> 09:43.498
- I didn't say anything
about the lawsuit

09:43.499 --> 09:46.100
because my lawyer said
not to mention it to anyone.

09:46.101 --> 09:48.369
- Uh, no, see,
we're not "anyone."

09:48.370 --> 09:49.971
We're the police,
and the two men

09:49.972 --> 09:53.609
who were suing you were found
murdered in your offices.

09:53.610 --> 09:54.944
Really?

09:54.945 --> 09:56.612
You think I killed them
with my bare hands?

09:56.613 --> 09:58.181
- You?
Those two big guys?

09:58.182 --> 09:59.282
No.

09:59.283 --> 10:02.185
- All the same,
where were you last night?

10:02.186 --> 10:03.519
I was at home.

10:03.520 --> 10:06.856
- With me...
From 10:00 on.

10:06.857 --> 10:08.624
We were watching videos
on the net.

10:08.625 --> 10:09.892
You have a cap.

10:09.893 --> 10:12.228
You're the guy in the posters.

10:12.229 --> 10:15.631
My boyfriend, PJ Edwards.

10:15.632 --> 10:17.633
You work here?

10:17.634 --> 10:20.102
- PJ's on our board
of directors.

10:20.103 --> 10:21.804
- So you're a member
of the board,

10:21.805 --> 10:23.238
so you're being sued
as well?

10:23.239 --> 10:25.207
- Come on, you guys
don't seriously think

10:25.208 --> 10:26.942
we have anything
to do with this?

10:26.943 --> 10:28.210
- Thing is,
girlfriend and boyfriend

10:28.211 --> 10:31.379
alibiing each other,
that doesn't impress us.

10:31.380 --> 10:35.050
You and Parker Gaffneys
had words a couple nights ago

10:35.051 --> 10:36.118
at a nightclub.

10:36.119 --> 10:38.120
Parker's a hothead.

10:38.121 --> 10:39.454
What about you, PJ?

10:39.455 --> 10:41.056
Are you a hothead?

10:41.057 --> 10:43.458
What do I have
to do with this?

10:43.459 --> 10:46.328
Well, your girlfriend here

10:46.329 --> 10:48.664
doesn't look like the type
to go to a nightclub on her own.

10:48.665 --> 10:51.533
You probably went with her,

10:51.534 --> 10:53.736
got into it
with Parker Gaffneys.

10:53.737 --> 10:56.105
I was there with Rex Tamlyn.

10:56.106 --> 10:57.973
Oh, who is Mr. Tamlyn?

10:57.974 --> 10:59.208
He's a partner in Kizmate.

10:59.209 --> 11:00.810
Our principal business
strategist.

11:00.811 --> 11:04.896
- And another name to party
in the lawsuit?

11:07.200 --> 11:09.284
Sorry, vips only.

11:09.285 --> 11:11.553
- We're on the list.
- Guess you are.

11:11.554 --> 11:13.989
- We're looking for
Rex Tamlyn.

11:13.990 --> 11:15.857
Thank you.

11:15.858 --> 11:18.927
Thanks.

11:18.928 --> 11:20.295
Am-scray, ladies.

11:20.296 --> 11:22.597
We need some face time
with Mr. Tamlyn.

11:22.598 --> 11:23.699
- It's okay.
It's all right.

11:23.700 --> 11:26.102
I know what this is about.

11:26.103 --> 11:27.837
The Gaffneys brothers?

11:27.838 --> 11:29.205
Horrible what happened.

11:29.206 --> 11:31.174
- Yeah, you seem really
broken up about it.

11:31.175 --> 11:33.442
Hey, I mean...

11:33.443 --> 11:34.710
I barely knew 'em.

11:34.711 --> 11:36.279
- Excuse me.
But they knew you.

11:36.280 --> 11:39.315
They were suing you.
Sorry, excuse me.

11:39.316 --> 11:41.484
- Yeah,
completely without merit.

11:41.485 --> 11:43.486
They're just looking
for a payout from Danielle.

11:43.487 --> 11:44.987
It's my job to protect her,
all right?

11:44.988 --> 11:47.456
She's brilliant,
but she's into Kismet.

11:47.457 --> 11:48.790
I'm into cash.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.091
By any means necessary.

11:50.092 --> 11:51.593
We looked you up.

11:51.594 --> 11:52.894
Your last Internet venture

11:52.895 --> 11:54.595
was interactive porn?

11:54.596 --> 11:57.198
- Uh, please.
Virtual eroticism.

11:58.233 --> 11:59.900
It's all about packaging.

11:59.901 --> 12:02.803
It was my idea
to have Danielle and PJ

12:02.804 --> 12:05.838
as the poster kids
for Kizmate.

12:05.839 --> 12:08.074
- What better way to prove
that Kismet works?

12:08.075 --> 12:09.309
Exactly.

12:09.310 --> 12:11.779
- Well, here's some
more Kismet.

12:11.780 --> 12:13.915
Two nights ago,
Parker Gaffneys rolls up

12:13.916 --> 12:16.317
on you and Danielle,
threatened you,

12:16.318 --> 12:18.219
and then last night,
he and his brother

12:18.220 --> 12:21.155
end up dead in your office.

12:21.156 --> 12:22.356
- And I'm the only guy
in this city

12:22.357 --> 12:23.558
Parker Gaffneys
had a beef with?

12:23.559 --> 12:25.659
Listen, I-
not to speak ill of the dead,

12:25.660 --> 12:27.662
but the guy had a major chip
on his shoulder.

12:27.663 --> 12:30.565
- You know,
we keep hearing that.

12:30.566 --> 12:32.701
What about
his brother Thomas?

12:32.702 --> 12:34.268
Thomas?

12:34.269 --> 12:35.503
Thomas had nothing to prove.

12:35.504 --> 12:37.371
Thomas had made millions
off his own ideas.

12:37.372 --> 12:38.873
Dollars to donuts,
Parker was the one

12:38.874 --> 12:40.742
behind that lawsuit.

12:40.743 --> 12:41.976
- Thanks for the insight,
but we still need to know

12:41.977 --> 12:43.111
where you were last night.

12:43.112 --> 12:45.313
- Right here,
ass on leather.

12:45.314 --> 12:46.581
You can ask Billy the owner.

12:46.582 --> 12:48.516
Hell, ask the girls.
I was here till last call.

12:48.517 --> 12:50.418
Listen, I don't know who killed
the Gaffneys brothers,

12:50.419 --> 12:51.553
but it wasn't me.

12:51.554 --> 12:52.621
That lawsuit was nothing.

12:52.622 --> 12:55.290
They had no proof
of anything.

12:55.291 --> 12:58.093
Now, if you don't mind,
I'm gonna hit the dance floor.

12:58.094 --> 12:59.795
Care to join?

12:59.796 --> 13:01.097
Pass.

13:01.098 --> 13:05.635
- Aww.
Your loss.

13:05.636 --> 13:08.504
- Maybe that's what
the Gaffneyss were looking for-

13:08.505 --> 13:10.773
proof Danielle stole
their idea.

13:10.774 --> 13:14.260
- Maybe what Parker
was looking for.

13:17.464 --> 13:20.750
Under arms.

13:20.751 --> 13:25.789
Sweat.

13:25.790 --> 13:28.625
I'd really like to dance,
you know?

13:28.626 --> 13:31.561
We should call Rodgers.

13:31.562 --> 13:33.864
I was looking out for you.

13:33.865 --> 13:35.766
By lying to the police?

13:35.767 --> 13:37.101
- Well,
I knew you were home,

13:37.102 --> 13:38.970
so why not just stop
the cops right there?

13:38.971 --> 13:40.038
I know where I was.

13:40.039 --> 13:42.507
Where were you?

13:42.508 --> 13:44.509
Okay.

13:44.510 --> 13:46.511
Fine.

13:46.512 --> 13:48.714
I'll call the cops right now
and tell them I lied,

13:48.715 --> 13:50.182
and you went along with it.

13:50.183 --> 13:53.601
Hmm?

13:58.373 --> 14:00.191
I'm just trying to keep us
together, Danielle.

14:05.680 --> 14:07.465
- Well, even though
I kick myself

14:07.466 --> 14:10.000
every time I say this,
you were right.

14:10.001 --> 14:13.237
I found Thomas Gaffneys's
deodorant

14:13.238 --> 14:15.472
on Parker Gaffneys's hands.

14:15.473 --> 14:17.308
Sweat mixed
with antiperspirant.

14:17.309 --> 14:20.211
Sweat from Thomas's armpits?

14:20.212 --> 14:23.014
- So Parker grabbed
his brother under the arms,

14:23.015 --> 14:25.617
dragged him away from
the pinball machine...

14:25.618 --> 14:27.519
The pinball machine
where he killed him.

14:27.520 --> 14:28.987
Wha-I beg your pardon?

14:28.988 --> 14:31.223
Twin number one killed
twin number two?

14:31.224 --> 14:33.058
We think.

14:33.059 --> 14:35.060
- Well, so much
for brotherly love.

14:35.061 --> 14:36.662
One killer down.

14:36.663 --> 14:39.047
One more to go.

14:41.229 --> 14:42.929
I know about
what a kin is able

14:42.930 --> 14:45.364
but someone killing
their twin?

14:45.399 --> 14:46.816
According to witnesses,

14:46.817 --> 14:49.151
Parker was the fire-breather
in the family.

14:49.152 --> 14:51.554
The lawsuit was his idea.

14:51.555 --> 14:54.790
So was probably breaking
into Kizmate.

14:54.791 --> 14:56.725
- Thomas, he got a call
while he was having dinner

14:56.726 --> 14:59.095
with his father
from a no-name cell phone.

14:59.096 --> 15:01.197
That might have been Parker
telling him

15:01.198 --> 15:02.466
what he was about to do.

15:02.467 --> 15:04.001
Thomas went and tried
to stop him.

15:04.002 --> 15:05.936
- And push came to shove
and Thomas ended up

15:05.937 --> 15:08.172
taking a header
into the pinball machine?

15:08.173 --> 15:09.440
Something like that.

15:09.441 --> 15:10.708
Thomas didn't die right away.

15:10.709 --> 15:13.044
- Parker would have noticed
that he was still alive.

15:13.045 --> 15:15.246
He wouldn't abandon
his brother.

15:15.247 --> 15:16.681
- But he didn't want
to call 911

15:16.682 --> 15:20.518
while they were still
in the offices of Kizmate.

15:20.519 --> 15:21.719
Right.

15:21.720 --> 15:24.656
So he tried to get
his brother outside,

15:24.657 --> 15:27.425
you know, down on the street,
call for help.

15:27.426 --> 15:28.793
- That's what he was doing
when he ran into

15:28.794 --> 15:30.095
whoever killed him.

15:30.096 --> 15:32.664
So you have three suspects.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.399
- Three people who stood
to lose big

15:34.400 --> 15:37.668
if the Gaffneyss
won their lawsuit.

15:37.669 --> 15:39.904
- That's assuming that
the lawsuit has merit,

15:39.905 --> 15:44.675
that this girl did indeed
steal the Gaffneyss' idea.

15:44.676 --> 15:48.679
- That's what we think Parker
Gaffneys was looking for-proof.

15:48.680 --> 15:51.582
- Well, why don't you finish
what he started?

15:51.583 --> 15:54.653
- At our first meeting
with Danielle,

15:54.654 --> 15:57.189
Parker and Thomas
were spitballing their idea

15:57.190 --> 15:58.590
for the site.

15:58.591 --> 16:01.026
Danielle got this excited look
on her face

16:01.027 --> 16:03.596
and started scribbling
in a yellow notepad.

16:03.597 --> 16:07.733
- It's a complex mathematical
algorithm

16:07.734 --> 16:09.936
she had a moment
of inspiration.

16:09.937 --> 16:11.471
- She tore the page
from the yellow pad,

16:11.472 --> 16:15.175
but her pen left an indentation
on the page below it.

16:15.176 --> 16:18.445
We had a handwriting expert
verify it.

16:18.446 --> 16:20.714
It's proof that she came up
with the algorithm

16:20.715 --> 16:22.782
for the application
during that meeting.

16:22.783 --> 16:25.218
It's not enough.

16:25.219 --> 16:27.654
You needed to prove
that this algorithm

16:27.655 --> 16:29.990
was the basis for Kizmate.

16:29.991 --> 16:32.426
The only way to find that
was by hacking

16:32.427 --> 16:33.727
into their main computer.

16:33.728 --> 16:34.795
- I'm sure that's
what Parker

16:34.796 --> 16:36.397
was hoping
to do that night.

16:36.398 --> 16:39.616
- We'll need a copy
of this doodle.

16:43.289 --> 16:45.007
It's better late than never.

16:45.008 --> 16:46.692
Building security tracked
a swipe card entry

16:46.727 --> 16:50.380
into the Kizmate offices
at 10:12 P.M.

16:50.381 --> 16:53.116
Card belonging
to a Kizmate employee.

16:53.117 --> 16:55.484
One Hildy Whitmore.

16:55.485 --> 16:57.486
- I didn't give my card
to anybody.

16:57.487 --> 16:59.554
I lost it
or somebody stole it.

16:59.555 --> 17:00.756
I don't-I don't know.

17:00.757 --> 17:05.425
Okay, we buy that.

17:05.426 --> 17:06.761
So I can leave?

17:06.762 --> 17:08.729
Not quite.

17:08.730 --> 17:11.398
So you're a secretary
at Kizmate?

17:11.400 --> 17:13.468
I'm Danielle's assistant.

17:13.469 --> 17:15.604
Oh, you're an assistant.

17:15.605 --> 17:17.506
That's long hours,
I bet.

17:17.507 --> 17:19.775
We checked your work station.

17:19.776 --> 17:22.744
You logged off your computer
at 7:36

17:22.746 --> 17:24.180
the night of the murders.

17:24.181 --> 17:27.117
- Like you said,
long hours.

17:27.117 --> 17:29.019
Hmm.

17:29.020 --> 17:31.722
You were there all alone

17:31.723 --> 17:34.124
just holding the fort down.

17:34.125 --> 17:35.859
Danielle counts on me.

17:35.860 --> 17:37.795
That's ironic.

17:37.796 --> 17:38.962
It is ironic.

17:38.963 --> 17:42.132
- Ironic,
because six minutes later,

17:42.133 --> 17:44.367
someone turned off
the security cameras.

17:44.368 --> 17:48.271
And since you were
the only one in the fort-

17:48.272 --> 17:49.572
- you think I helped those
Gaffneys creeps

17:49.573 --> 17:51.207
break into our offices?

17:51.208 --> 17:52.842
Why would I do that?

17:52.843 --> 17:54.810
Money, for starters.

17:57.648 --> 17:59.016
You don't understand.

17:59.017 --> 18:00.851
I've worked for Danielle
for a year.

18:00.852 --> 18:02.252
She gave me shares
in Kizmate.

18:02.253 --> 18:03.587
Why would I want
to help people

18:03.588 --> 18:04.922
who want to take down
the company?

18:04.923 --> 18:06.958
I know, right?

18:06.959 --> 18:09.728
That's a good question.

18:09.729 --> 18:13.732
Why would you?

18:13.733 --> 18:15.968
You know what?

18:15.969 --> 18:18.219
I'm not under arrest,
so I'm leaving.

18:26.062 --> 18:27.979
Pants on fire?

18:27.980 --> 18:32.250
Totally.

18:32.251 --> 18:33.718
- I don't like it, Rex.
- Trust me.

18:33.719 --> 18:34.953
You keep saying that.

18:34.954 --> 18:36.988
Listen...

18:36.989 --> 18:39.391
If you know what's
good for you, for all of us,

18:39.392 --> 18:41.210
you will keep your mouth shut.

18:47.985 --> 18:50.570
- There it is, right there
in the Kizmate source code.

18:50.571 --> 18:52.706
The same algorithm that
was on that piece of paper.

18:52.707 --> 18:55.209
- It doesn't look the same.
- Oh, sorry.

18:55.210 --> 18:56.876
Let me express it
as an algorithm.

18:56.877 --> 18:58.912
Better?

18:58.913 --> 19:00.113
Hmm.

19:00.114 --> 19:01.447
- I had to patch it together
by breaking down

19:01.448 --> 19:04.283
the Kizmate app and searching
their offline archives.

19:04.284 --> 19:05.718
So there's the proof.

19:05.719 --> 19:08.621
Danielle came up with this idea
in the Gaffneyss' office.

19:08.622 --> 19:10.089
They had a case.

19:10.090 --> 19:12.724
- Danielle had reason
to be worried.

19:12.725 --> 19:15.394
- Danielle and the other
two musketeers,

19:15.395 --> 19:19.565
PJ and Rex.

19:19.566 --> 19:21.334
What if Hildy had
second thoughts

19:21.335 --> 19:22.835
about helping the Gaffneyss?

19:22.836 --> 19:25.772
What if she told Danielle
what the Gaffneyss were up to?

19:25.773 --> 19:28.007
- Danielle might have gone
to her office that night

19:28.008 --> 19:32.562
with her musketeers to deal
with Parker Gaffneys.

19:34.398 --> 19:37.651
- Hildy, I need the p&l
from last quarter.

19:37.652 --> 19:39.854
I got to go.

19:39.855 --> 19:41.456
Miss magee, you mind?

19:41.457 --> 19:43.993
We need a few minutes
with you.

19:43.994 --> 19:45.094
- But I'm in the middle
of a meeting.

19:45.095 --> 19:46.495
We won't take long.

19:46.496 --> 19:48.798
- I don't know what more
I can tell you.

19:48.799 --> 19:51.000
- It's not about telling.
It's about explaining.

19:51.001 --> 19:54.003
- We found the algorithm
in your source code.

19:54.004 --> 19:57.673
So the Gaffneyss,
they weren't lying.

19:57.674 --> 19:59.308
You stole the idea from them.

19:59.309 --> 20:00.676
No.

20:00.677 --> 20:02.478
- You found out Parker
was breaking into your office.

20:02.479 --> 20:03.779
You came here to stop him.

20:03.780 --> 20:04.881
That's not true.

20:04.882 --> 20:06.315
I didn't kill anybody.

20:06.316 --> 20:07.683
We need to talk to you.

20:07.684 --> 20:11.721
She's telling the truth.

20:11.722 --> 20:14.190
Danielle was with me
the night of the murder.

20:14.191 --> 20:17.860
We were together all night.

20:17.861 --> 20:21.880
Now that's Kismet.

20:23.669 --> 20:26.653
What I said all night,
I didn't mean it in a sexual way.

20:26.654 --> 20:28.621
Right.
It's an American idiom.

20:28.622 --> 20:29.989
Yes.

20:29.990 --> 20:32.124
What I meant was
Danielle and I met

20:32.125 --> 20:34.960
at the cherry Lane tavern
on the lower east side

20:34.961 --> 20:36.562
from 8:00 to 2:00 A.M.

20:36.563 --> 20:38.263
Six hours?

20:38.264 --> 20:40.398
So if you weren't having sex,
what were you doing?

20:40.399 --> 20:42.567
Working on a settlement.

20:42.568 --> 20:44.402
Only Parker wanted
the lawsuit.

20:44.403 --> 20:46.370
I was the peacemaker.

20:46.371 --> 20:47.838
I offered Danielle a deal.

20:47.839 --> 20:50.607
- Why didn't you
tell us that before?

20:50.608 --> 20:51.941
- Because I didn't think
it had anything to do

20:51.942 --> 20:53.610
with Parker
and Thomas' deaths.

20:53.611 --> 20:55.612
- Did they know about
the settlement?

20:55.613 --> 20:57.447
No.

20:57.448 --> 21:00.150
I wanted Danielle
on board first

21:00.151 --> 21:01.885
and then I was gonna
tell them in the morning.

21:01.886 --> 21:03.620
But it was too late.

21:03.621 --> 21:05.823
- I lied about PJ because
I had to keep

21:05.824 --> 21:07.090
the settlement secret.

21:07.091 --> 21:08.959
I was trying to save
my company.

21:08.960 --> 21:10.560
But I swear I was
at the cherry tavern.

21:10.561 --> 21:12.328
Samir is telling the truth.

21:12.329 --> 21:14.965
- He's got about as much
credibility as you right now.

21:14.966 --> 21:16.300
Why would samir lie for me?

21:16.301 --> 21:17.902
- I can think
of a million reasons.

21:17.903 --> 21:19.771
The lawsuit's still on.

21:19.772 --> 21:21.306
If he can keep you
out of jail long enough

21:21.307 --> 21:24.810
to sign off on this settlement,
he stands to win big.

21:24.811 --> 21:27.946
- The settlement I proposed
was more than fair.

21:27.947 --> 21:30.916
The twins and I would receive
15% of preferred stock

21:30.917 --> 21:33.718
and a percentage
of royalties based on sales.

21:33.719 --> 21:36.887
- All right,
which at the current valuation

21:36.888 --> 21:37.988
of the company comes-

21:37.989 --> 21:39.723
$37 million.

21:39.724 --> 21:41.391
A drop in the bucket
for Danielle.

21:41.392 --> 21:43.894
- Right, and worth it
to her to avoid

21:43.895 --> 21:46.129
the bad publicity
of a lawsuit.

21:46.130 --> 21:51.501
- In business, sometimes you win
by surrendering.

21:51.502 --> 21:54.471
Or lying.

21:54.472 --> 21:56.907
I wonder how much
the shares of Kizmate

21:56.908 --> 22:00.644
would be worth
if the CEO was in jail.

22:00.645 --> 22:03.013
I'm not protecting Danielle.

22:03.014 --> 22:04.348
- Yeah, see,
'cause it just occurred to me

22:04.349 --> 22:07.351
that by alibiing her,
you're alibiing yourself.

22:07.352 --> 22:10.021
Why would I need an alibi?

22:10.022 --> 22:12.690
Twins out of the way.

22:12.691 --> 22:14.325
You gain most
from the settlement.

22:14.326 --> 22:16.027
That's motive.

22:16.028 --> 22:19.931
- What?
I murdered-

22:19.932 --> 22:21.300
are you insane?

22:21.301 --> 22:23.936
- The jury's still out
on that one.

22:23.937 --> 22:25.170
That's it.

22:25.171 --> 22:27.807
I'm calling my attorney.

22:27.808 --> 22:29.542
- Your company
is worth millions.

22:29.543 --> 22:32.078
You would say anything
to protect that.

22:32.079 --> 22:34.046
- I didn't care about
the money.

22:34.047 --> 22:35.514
I never did.

22:35.515 --> 22:38.016
I just wanted to write code,
be creative,

22:38.017 --> 22:40.652
have fun,
to enjoy my life with PJ.

22:40.653 --> 22:44.389
- The Gaffneys twins were trying
to spoil your dream.

22:44.390 --> 22:46.490
That must have made you angry.

22:46.491 --> 22:48.058
It was all Parker.

22:48.059 --> 22:49.559
He was ruthless.

22:49.560 --> 22:51.895
Not Thomas?

22:51.896 --> 22:54.897
No.

22:54.898 --> 22:56.399
Thomas too.

22:56.400 --> 22:59.535
- I thought you barely
knew them.

22:59.536 --> 23:00.837
I don't.

23:00.838 --> 23:02.038
I was ready to settle.

23:02.039 --> 23:03.106
I would have paid anything

23:03.107 --> 23:04.808
to have my old life back,

23:04.809 --> 23:06.910
to have everything
the way it was.

23:06.911 --> 23:09.663
Just me and PJ.

23:13.234 --> 23:15.219
- You were making
a deal with samir

23:15.220 --> 23:16.587
and you weren't
gonna tell me?

23:16.588 --> 23:18.556
- I was, but-
- I lied to the cops for you!

23:18.557 --> 23:20.158
- Whoa, guys, guys!
Let's chill out, okay?

23:20.159 --> 23:22.327
- You still haven't told me
where you were that night.

23:22.328 --> 23:23.561
- Oh, you're interrogating
me now?

23:23.562 --> 23:24.796
This is ridiculous.
- Oh, PJ!

23:24.797 --> 23:26.698
God, I hate this!
I hate the company!

23:26.699 --> 23:28.634
I hate this life!
- All right, listen!

23:28.635 --> 23:30.369
You guys can bitch
at each other all you want,

23:30.370 --> 23:33.805
but let's not forget why we're
here in the first place, huh?

23:33.806 --> 23:35.373
Kismet, baby!

23:35.374 --> 23:37.008
People believe in it.

23:37.009 --> 23:38.843
So you better keep living it.

23:43.698 --> 23:46.583
- Samir closed out his tab
at the cherry tavern at 11:30.

23:46.584 --> 23:47.651
It proves he was there,

23:47.652 --> 23:49.285
but not necessarily
with Danielle.

23:49.286 --> 23:51.421
Why would he lie?

23:51.422 --> 23:53.323
- He made a deal with her that
could put 40 million bucks

23:53.324 --> 23:54.558
in his pocket.

23:54.559 --> 23:56.126
It's worth nothing
if she's in jail.

23:56.127 --> 23:58.462
- But even so,
if Danielle made a settlement

23:58.463 --> 24:00.297
with samir,
I don't see her having a motive

24:00.298 --> 24:02.968
to stab Parker Gaffneys
in the neck.

24:02.969 --> 24:04.770
Agreed?

24:04.771 --> 24:05.904
Sure.

24:05.905 --> 24:07.739
She had no financial motive.

24:07.740 --> 24:10.810
- Good.
So who did?

24:10.811 --> 24:14.146
Danielle's partners were in
the dark about this settlement?

24:14.147 --> 24:15.681
Apparently.

24:15.682 --> 24:16.781
So which one?

24:16.782 --> 24:20.952
Granola boy
or the ex-pornographer?

24:20.953 --> 24:23.321
The ex-pornographer.

24:23.322 --> 24:25.256
I owe him a dance.

24:25.257 --> 24:27.758
- Uh, yeah,
I mean, I told you guys

24:27.759 --> 24:28.992
I wasn't here that night.

24:28.993 --> 24:30.961
I'm hardly ever here.

24:30.962 --> 24:32.529
Well, you're here now.

24:32.530 --> 24:34.765
Turns out,
your buddies at the club,

24:34.766 --> 24:36.734
Billy and the ladies,
they can't remember

24:36.735 --> 24:38.436
if you were there or not.

24:38.437 --> 24:40.004
Uh, great.

24:40.005 --> 24:42.841
So now I have
to prove a negative?

24:42.842 --> 24:44.009
Well, it'd be a lot easier

24:44.010 --> 24:45.477
if all your friends
weren't cokeheads.

24:45.478 --> 24:48.781
Looks like you have a pretty
nasty habit yourself.

24:48.782 --> 24:50.550
- What are you,
my father?

24:50.551 --> 24:53.187
- No, I'm a concerned citizen
with a badge.

24:53.188 --> 24:55.121
You know that stuff impairs
your judgment, right?

24:55.122 --> 24:57.391
It makes you erratic.

24:57.392 --> 24:58.758
Aggressive.

24:58.759 --> 25:00.427
- Also makes you
highly sexualized.

25:00.428 --> 25:03.296
You know Hildy,
Danielle's assistant.

25:03.297 --> 25:04.397
You know, she was here
that night.

25:04.398 --> 25:05.632
- Oh, okay.
Well, great.

25:05.633 --> 25:07.067
Then she can tell you
that I wasn't.

25:07.068 --> 25:08.969
- She's too scared
to say much of anything.

25:08.970 --> 25:11.038
She's pretty good-looking.

25:11.039 --> 25:12.606
Don't you think, Rex?

25:12.607 --> 25:14.909
Maybe you figured you'd have
a go at her that night.

25:14.910 --> 25:16.377
- Maybe you turned off
the security cameras

25:16.378 --> 25:18.111
so Danielle couldn't see
your bare butt

25:18.112 --> 25:19.813
bouncing around her office.

25:19.814 --> 25:21.581
- Where do you guys
come up with this stuff?

25:21.582 --> 25:22.983
Experience.

25:22.984 --> 25:24.651
- And then after that,
you curled up to have a nap.

25:24.652 --> 25:26.420
- But you were woken up
by a ruckus

25:26.421 --> 25:29.756
and you found Parker Gaffneys
dragging his dead brother.

25:29.757 --> 25:32.493
- All that marching
powder up your nose,

25:32.494 --> 25:33.694
you went after Parker.

25:33.695 --> 25:36.363
- With scissors.
That's what the autopsy showed.

25:38.066 --> 25:40.033
Very good.
Very good.

25:40.034 --> 25:41.702
Only problem
is it didn't happen.

25:41.703 --> 25:42.903
Wasn't me.

25:42.904 --> 25:44.705
- Then who, Rex?
Who did it?

25:44.706 --> 25:46.473
- I don't know.
I don't-

25:46.474 --> 25:49.476
but, but all that stuff about
Hildy and the security cameras

25:49.477 --> 25:51.144
is pure fantasy
and I can prove it.

25:51.145 --> 25:54.597
And I'll show you right now.
Come on.

25:59.536 --> 26:01.321
I had the security system
installed

26:01.322 --> 26:02.889
with a secret feature.

26:02.890 --> 26:04.991
Here, you see the cupid,
the bellybutton?

26:04.992 --> 26:06.059
- Let me guess.
It's a camera.

26:06.060 --> 26:07.928
Yes, exactly.

26:07.929 --> 26:09.496
So anytime the system
is shut down,

26:09.497 --> 26:11.831
the camera takes one last shot
of the security room.

26:11.832 --> 26:14.400
- It takes a picture of whoever
turns off the system.

26:14.401 --> 26:15.735
Who else knows about it?

26:15.736 --> 26:17.736
Just me and Danielle.

26:17.737 --> 26:19.738
Maybe she told Hildy.

26:19.739 --> 26:21.739
So let's see.

26:21.740 --> 26:23.641
So last Tuesday night.

26:23.642 --> 26:25.276
Here we go.

26:25.277 --> 26:27.044
Great camera work.

26:27.045 --> 26:28.379
- No, it's blocked
by something.

26:28.380 --> 26:29.980
Yeah.

26:29.981 --> 26:33.517
Open-weave pattern
like a sweater, blue.

26:33.518 --> 26:35.870
A blue knit cap.

26:41.955 --> 26:42.955
It's crap.

26:46.256 --> 26:48.708
Have a seat.

26:48.709 --> 26:53.446
Lying to the police
is serious business.

26:53.447 --> 26:54.514
I find it very annoying,

26:54.515 --> 26:57.184
your...Cap.

26:57.185 --> 26:59.887
I mean, you don't see anybody
else wearing caps

26:59.888 --> 27:01.588
or hats or anything else silly
in here, do you?

27:01.589 --> 27:03.757
This is one police Plaza.

27:03.758 --> 27:05.892
Have some respect.

27:07.495 --> 27:09.512
Uh...

27:19.822 --> 27:23.075
Look at this.

27:23.076 --> 27:27.680
The perfect hat rack
for a cap.

27:27.681 --> 27:29.014
Don't you agree?

27:29.015 --> 27:30.549
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

27:30.550 --> 27:31.583
Oh, okay.

27:31.584 --> 27:35.054
I'm talking about this.

27:35.055 --> 27:37.557
Your cap over the camera.

27:37.558 --> 27:40.560
Tuesday night, 7:42.

27:40.561 --> 27:42.762
What were you doing
in those offices

27:42.763 --> 27:44.197
you didn't anyone to see?

27:44.198 --> 27:47.917
- You can't prove
that's my cap.

27:50.554 --> 27:53.539
- I bet she can prove
that it's your cap

27:53.540 --> 27:57.076
and a lot more.

27:57.077 --> 28:02.214
You and Hildy...

28:02.215 --> 28:07.054
Is that Kismet or,
you know, hormones?

28:07.055 --> 28:08.289
You want a soda?

28:08.290 --> 28:11.659
No, I just-

28:11.660 --> 28:15.163
oh, I forgot to tell you.

28:15.164 --> 28:17.666
We asked your friend
to come in too.

28:17.667 --> 28:19.268
Oh, God.

28:19.269 --> 28:21.237
- If you want to say hi,
you can just wave or-

28:21.238 --> 28:22.872
oh, God.

28:22.873 --> 28:24.340
Am I in a lot of trouble?

28:24.341 --> 28:28.744
- Yes, sweetie,
you are in a lot of trouble.

28:28.745 --> 28:33.315
- I'm not a big believer
in Kismet either, you know?

28:33.316 --> 28:38.020
It's bound to fade.

28:38.021 --> 28:41.023
I mean, two people
in a relationship forever

28:41.024 --> 28:42.492
and exclusion with all others,

28:42.493 --> 28:46.129
I mean,
it's against our nature.

28:46.130 --> 28:48.498
I mean,
that kind of possessiveness

28:48.499 --> 28:51.334
is not what assured us
our survival

28:51.335 --> 28:52.568
when we were out there,
you know,

28:52.569 --> 28:54.871
foraging on the Savannah.

28:54.872 --> 28:58.975
Ah-la-la-la-la!

28:58.976 --> 29:03.346
What do you think?

29:03.347 --> 29:06.917
You and Danielle
on the posters.

29:06.918 --> 29:08.685
That was a dream,
right?

29:08.686 --> 29:11.387
It's real.

29:11.388 --> 29:15.558
- Yeah, I think that
that woman out there

29:15.559 --> 29:19.563
would have
a different opinion.

29:19.564 --> 29:20.798
Come on, PJ.

29:20.799 --> 29:25.669
What happened in those offices
that night?

29:25.670 --> 29:27.638
Okay.

29:27.639 --> 29:31.893
Well, I'll just get it
out of her.

29:41.370 --> 29:43.655
Well, that's it.
I got everything.

29:43.656 --> 29:46.307
Oh, God.

29:50.245 --> 29:51.562
So you and PJ?

29:51.563 --> 29:52.930
Yes.

29:52.931 --> 29:54.665
For the past two months.

29:54.666 --> 29:56.334
PJ told me that he and Danielle
hadn't slept

29:56.335 --> 29:57.869
in the same bed in months.

29:57.870 --> 30:01.772
- You and PJ'd hook up
at the office?

30:01.773 --> 30:03.841
Only when I had to work late.

30:03.842 --> 30:05.643
PJ knew how to turn off
the security cameras

30:05.644 --> 30:07.111
so nobody'd know.

30:07.112 --> 30:10.815
- And Tuesday night?
- Yeah, same thing.

30:10.816 --> 30:14.918
Um, but we left around 8:30.

30:14.919 --> 30:17.187
- Are you sure
about that, Hildy?

30:17.188 --> 30:18.655
Yes.

30:18.656 --> 30:22.626
PJ wanted to hang out more,
but...

30:22.627 --> 30:24.895
But...

30:24.896 --> 30:28.232
I knew Parker Gaffneys
was gonna be there later.

30:28.233 --> 30:31.136
- You knew because you'd given
him the swipe card?

30:31.137 --> 30:33.706
Yes.

30:33.707 --> 30:35.975
I had no choice.
He blackmailed me.

30:35.976 --> 30:37.944
How'd he do that?

30:37.945 --> 30:43.182
- He knew that PJ
and I were...

30:43.183 --> 30:44.616
He threatened
to tell Danielle.

30:44.617 --> 30:45.984
I own shares in the company.

30:45.985 --> 30:48.920
I would have lost everything.

30:48.921 --> 30:50.221
How did he know?

30:50.222 --> 30:51.622
Did he say?

30:51.623 --> 30:54.158
- I don't know.
He just knew.

30:54.159 --> 30:55.826
- I told you,
I didn't know anything

30:55.827 --> 30:57.828
about the break-in.

30:57.829 --> 30:59.296
- You just happened
to have settlement talks

30:59.297 --> 31:00.631
with Danielle that same night

31:00.632 --> 31:02.600
Parker was breaking
into her offices?

31:02.601 --> 31:04.502
- Got to admit that's
a big coincidence.

31:04.503 --> 31:06.671
Maybe so.

31:06.672 --> 31:08.807
I just wish I worked out
the settlement sooner.

31:08.808 --> 31:11.176
- No, see, you're gonna wish you
stopped lying to us sooner.

31:11.177 --> 31:13.612
- I'm sure
an obstruction charge

31:13.613 --> 31:15.681
will impress the investment
banks that you deal with.

31:15.682 --> 31:17.717
All right.

31:17.718 --> 31:20.954
Maybe I had an inkling
of what Parker was up to,

31:20.955 --> 31:22.923
but I advised him against it.

31:22.924 --> 31:24.992
That counts.

31:24.993 --> 31:27.528
- Parker blackmailed Danielle's
assistant Hildy

31:27.529 --> 31:29.462
to giving him
an access card.

31:29.463 --> 31:30.930
Did you know about that?

31:30.931 --> 31:32.933
Yes.

31:32.934 --> 31:36.069
Parker said his scheme
was foolproof.

31:36.070 --> 31:37.604
- Parker knew that Hildy
was sleeping

31:37.605 --> 31:38.739
with Danielle's boyfriend?

31:38.740 --> 31:40.240
Yes.

31:40.241 --> 31:42.108
- How did Parker know that?
Hmm?

31:42.109 --> 31:45.579
- Well, I think Thomas
told him.

31:45.580 --> 31:47.964
I have no idea
how Thomas knew.

31:52.170 --> 31:55.506
- I want you to send a text
for me on your cell phone.

31:59.345 --> 32:02.931
Hello.

32:02.932 --> 32:06.000
See, now I know why you fell
in love on this bridge.

32:06.001 --> 32:08.569
Sure is romantic.

32:08.570 --> 32:09.970
Where's samir?

32:09.971 --> 32:11.338
He sent me a message.

32:11.339 --> 32:13.306
We did, from his phone.

32:13.307 --> 32:16.042
- I see.
I'm leaving.

32:16.043 --> 32:17.576
We know about the affair.

32:17.577 --> 32:18.978
PJ and Hildy.

32:18.979 --> 32:20.746
Hildy told us all about it.

32:20.747 --> 32:23.015
They did the deed
that Tuesday night

32:23.016 --> 32:24.383
right in there at Kizmate.

32:24.384 --> 32:26.585
- That's why PJ turned off
the security cameras,

32:26.586 --> 32:29.121
'cause he didn't want you
to find out

32:29.122 --> 32:30.322
about him and Hildy.

32:30.323 --> 32:33.626
Well, it worked...

32:33.627 --> 32:35.428
Because I didn't know.

32:35.429 --> 32:39.065
- Really?
It was news to you?

32:39.066 --> 32:40.399
She look brokenhearted to you?

32:40.400 --> 32:41.834
Hardly.

32:41.835 --> 32:44.837
Don't tell me how I feel.

32:44.838 --> 32:46.138
You just told me
the man of my dreams

32:46.139 --> 32:47.573
was cheating on me.

32:47.574 --> 32:51.144
- Oh, you mean the romance
of a lifetime?

32:51.145 --> 32:53.045
The fluff that you sell
on your website?

32:53.046 --> 32:56.015
- Apps for saps.
- In caps.

32:56.016 --> 32:57.817
- I don't need to listen
to this.

32:57.818 --> 32:58.885
You knew.

32:58.886 --> 33:00.186
You knew about the affair

33:00.187 --> 33:02.254
and you told Thomas Gaffneys.

33:02.255 --> 33:03.856
He told Parker.

33:03.857 --> 33:07.160
Parker blackmailed Hildy
to get access to your office.

33:07.161 --> 33:08.762
That makes no sense.

33:08.763 --> 33:11.531
I didn't tell Thomas anything.
- You did.

33:11.532 --> 33:14.467
'Cause you'd tell the man
you love everything.

33:14.468 --> 33:16.703
The man I loved?

33:16.704 --> 33:18.070
He was suing me.

33:18.071 --> 33:19.505
Parker was.

33:19.506 --> 33:20.673
He was the ruthless one.

33:20.674 --> 33:22.274
You said so yourself.

33:22.275 --> 33:24.910
Thomas was different.

33:24.911 --> 33:28.080
We heard your hesitation...

33:28.081 --> 33:31.016
The way your voice softened
when you spoke his name.

33:31.017 --> 33:33.151
You're wrong.

33:33.152 --> 33:35.086
None of it is true.

33:35.087 --> 33:36.420
You called him that night

33:36.421 --> 33:38.722
after meeting with samir

33:38.723 --> 33:41.692
to tell him the good news about
how you settled the lawsuit.

33:41.693 --> 33:43.528
No.

33:43.529 --> 33:46.698
- You called him from your
no-name cell phone, Danielle.

33:46.699 --> 33:50.502
The one you used so PJ wouldn't
find out about your affair.

33:50.503 --> 33:53.572
- And that's when Thomas
told you that Parker

33:53.573 --> 33:55.941
was on his way to break
into your offices

33:55.942 --> 33:58.210
and that he was gonna try
and stop him.

33:58.211 --> 34:01.214
You were gonna meet him there.

34:01.215 --> 34:03.950
But you were too late.

34:03.951 --> 34:07.153
Thomas probably left
the door open for you.

34:07.154 --> 34:08.888
We couldn't find a card swipe
for your entry,

34:08.889 --> 34:12.257
but you entered that office.

34:12.259 --> 34:15.127
And you found Parker standing
over the body

34:15.128 --> 34:17.597
of the man that you loved.

34:17.598 --> 34:20.331
Isn't that right, Danielle?

34:20.333 --> 34:25.020
It's now or never, Danielle.

34:28.257 --> 34:30.257
Oh, God.

34:33.562 --> 34:37.715
- Danielle, you said
that you'd pay anything

34:37.716 --> 34:39.551
to get back to what you had,

34:39.552 --> 34:43.656
that state of grace,
the innocence that you felt

34:43.657 --> 34:45.158
on the bridge that day.

34:45.159 --> 34:47.493
There's only one way
back there.

34:47.494 --> 34:50.864
That starts with the truth.

34:50.864 --> 34:55.069
Everything got...

34:55.070 --> 34:57.972
So damn complicated.

34:57.973 --> 34:59.774
I understand.

34:59.775 --> 35:01.342
Do you?

35:01.343 --> 35:04.912
You called it fluff.

35:04.913 --> 35:08.449
You don't believe love
is possible?

35:08.450 --> 35:10.952
True love?

35:10.953 --> 35:15.773
I want to believe.

35:19.877 --> 35:23.397
Make me believe.

35:23.398 --> 35:28.902
So that's how you felt
about Thomas?

35:28.903 --> 35:31.203
We were so different.

35:31.204 --> 35:33.706
It didn't seem possible.

35:33.707 --> 35:37.643
But...I loved him.

35:37.644 --> 35:40.545
- Thomas was your real destiny,
your true love.

35:40.546 --> 35:42.914
Yes.

35:42.915 --> 35:45.684
So you need to help me...

35:45.685 --> 35:48.186
Believe that he was
your true love,

35:48.187 --> 35:50.555
that you would do anything
for him.

35:50.556 --> 35:53.058
I would.

35:53.059 --> 35:55.660
Even kill a man?

35:55.661 --> 36:00.398
The man who took his life?

36:00.399 --> 36:02.635
That you were willing
to give everything up

36:02.636 --> 36:05.905
that night for Thomas?

36:05.906 --> 36:09.225
What did you do, Danielle?

36:11.862 --> 36:15.149
I felt...

36:15.150 --> 36:18.620
I'd lost everything.

36:18.621 --> 36:21.923
Parker said it was my fault,

36:21.924 --> 36:24.192
that I turned Thomas
against him.

36:24.193 --> 36:27.162
He came at me.

36:27.163 --> 36:28.596
I had to do something.

36:28.597 --> 36:34.202
I grabbed scissors
from a desk and...

36:34.203 --> 36:38.523
I stabbed him.

36:41.694 --> 36:42.944
I'm sorry.

36:42.945 --> 36:45.013
I have to arrest you now,
Danielle.

36:45.014 --> 36:47.516
But it was in self defense.

36:47.517 --> 36:49.785
- We'll let a jury
sort that out.

36:49.786 --> 36:52.087
I'm sorry.

36:52.088 --> 36:54.923
I was in love with Thomas.

36:54.924 --> 36:57.375
I'm sorry.

37:03.382 --> 37:06.134
True love.

37:06.135 --> 37:09.153
We all want to believe.

37:16.195 --> 37:18.480
You lied to me last week.

37:18.481 --> 37:21.582
I mean, it's okay.
Everybody does.

37:21.583 --> 37:23.718
When did I do it?

37:23.719 --> 37:25.253
- Well, you said
that these sessions

37:25.254 --> 37:27.656
are so that I can get to know
about my own mind,

37:27.657 --> 37:29.691
but that's not what this
is really about.

37:29.692 --> 37:32.561
Because NYPD sent you here?

37:32.562 --> 37:34.530
- No, because NYPD
is paying you

37:34.531 --> 37:39.169
to assess my stability,
my temperament, right?

37:39.170 --> 37:42.439
- So what you're saying is that
I can't really be helping you

37:42.440 --> 37:45.241
and evaluating you for that?

37:45.242 --> 37:46.509
When you malfunction,

37:46.510 --> 37:51.847
I'm trying to find out
what happens and when.

37:51.848 --> 37:53.082
Yes, I'm evaluating you,

37:53.083 --> 37:56.585
but I'm also trying
to help you.

37:56.586 --> 38:00.755
Right now, I think the job
is vital to you.

38:00.756 --> 38:05.426
The job gives you structure,
sense of purpose.

38:05.427 --> 38:10.132
But you're convinced that it's
the only thing that defines you.

38:10.133 --> 38:14.170
You think, without the puzzle,
you don't matter.

38:14.171 --> 38:15.705
It's a lie,
but it's the only one

38:15.706 --> 38:17.674
you've chosen to believe.

38:17.675 --> 38:19.075
Consider this.

38:19.076 --> 38:20.243
If everyone lies,

38:20.244 --> 38:23.213
by definition,
that has to include you.

38:23.214 --> 38:26.215
And if that's true,
there's no way

38:26.216 --> 38:28.250
you can trust
your own judgment.

38:28.251 --> 38:32.588
Not when you put
the job before the man.

38:32.589 --> 38:35.958
There's so much more
to you than that.

38:35.959 --> 38:40.062
- Are you gonna
take my job away?

38:40.063 --> 38:42.597
- I'm gonna tell them that you
are more than capable

38:42.598 --> 38:47.102
of holding
down your job and...

38:47.103 --> 38:48.471
That you have anger
and trust issues

38:48.472 --> 38:51.807
that would benefit
from further treatment.

38:51.808 --> 38:56.612
- Yeah, well, I've been
to anger management.

38:56.613 --> 38:58.514
It only managed
to make me angrier.

38:58.515 --> 39:01.517
- But you need to learn
how to curb your anger

39:01.518 --> 39:03.052
to keep your job.

39:03.053 --> 39:06.221
And it's gonna be hard,
but you're smart.

39:06.222 --> 39:10.926
Smart enough to learn
how to game yourself.

39:10.927 --> 39:12.260
And...

39:12.261 --> 39:15.096
I could recommend
a couple of therapists.

39:15.097 --> 39:17.465
- What? Recommend?
What, you're passing the buck?

39:17.466 --> 39:19.333
- No, I didn't mean it
like that.

39:19.334 --> 39:20.401
- No, no, no, no.
Look.

39:20.402 --> 39:21.736
I'm not starting
with somebody new.

39:21.737 --> 39:24.172
No.
No.

39:24.173 --> 39:25.340
You've gotten to know me.

39:25.341 --> 39:27.376
You know what
you're getting into.

39:27.377 --> 39:31.814
You'll be fine.

39:31.815 --> 39:35.986
You're gonna be fine.

39:35.987 --> 39:40.191
Come on.

39:40.192 --> 39:41.893
Oh, I'd thought
about the riddle,

39:41.894 --> 39:45.563
the doors, the guards.

39:45.564 --> 39:48.198
- One guards heaven,
the other, hell.

39:48.199 --> 39:51.334
You have one question to ask.
What will it be?

39:51.335 --> 39:55.004
- What will
the other guard say

39:55.005 --> 40:00.076
if you ask him
if his is the door to heaven?

40:00.077 --> 40:01.693
Very good.

40:20.146 --> 40:22.214
Same time next week?

40:25.852 --> 40:27.853
Okay.

40:49.343 --> 40:51.428
Alex?

40:51.429 --> 40:54.664
How'd it go?

40:54.665 --> 41:02.807
Good.

41:02.808 --> 41:04.742
A call came in.

41:04.743 --> 41:07.511
D.O.A. At a bank
on west 44th street.

41:07.512 --> 41:09.213
The feds are
already on their way,

41:09.214 --> 41:12.050
but I thought we might want
to get there first.

41:12.051 --> 41:15.569
Get there first.

41:43.868 --> 41:48.656
Let's go.
