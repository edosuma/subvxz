...before there were movies or TVs

<i>"How could I be right," she asked...</i>

16:51.427 --> 16:57.230
<i>..."if that must mean that
such a distinguished scientist was wrong?"</i>

16:57.391 --> 17:00.520
<i>Despite her confidence
in the quality of her research...</i>

17:00.686 --> 17:03.701
<i>...she caved and added
a sentence to her</i>

17:03.713 --> 17:06.739
<i>thesis that undermined
its greatest insight.</i>

17:12.531 --> 17:16.627
It would be four years before Russell
realized that Payne was right.

17:16.786 --> 17:21.963
To his credit, as soon as he did,
he acknowledged that it was her discovery.

17:26.337 --> 17:29.136
<i>Payne's "Stellar Atmospheres"
is widely regarded...</i>

17:29.298 --> 17:33.144
<i>...as the most brilliant PhD thesis
ever written in astronomy.</i>

17:33.302 --> 17:36.681
<i>It became the standard text in its field.</i>

17:38.474 --> 17:41.648
<i><font color="#808080">PAYNE :</font> I was to blame

...but in science,
the only thing that counts...

18:00.121 --> 18:03.500
...is the evidence

18:03.666 --> 18:05.259
Cecilia Payne's interpretation...

18:05.418 --> 18:08.217

...and to trace the story

18:28.441 --> 18:30.910
<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font>
There are many kinds of stars.</i>

18:31.277 --> 18:33.530
<i>Some are bright like the sun.</i>

18:33.696 --> 18:35.369
<i>Some are dim.</i>

18:35.531 --> 18:40.037
<i>The greatest stars are ten million
times larger than the smallest ones.</i>

18:40.328 --> 18:45.585
<i>Some stars are old beyond imagining,
more than ten billion years of age.</i>

18:46.208 --> 18:48.302
<i>Others are being born right now.</i>

18:52.548 --> 18:56.769
When atoms fuse in the hearts of stars,
they make starlight.

18:56.927 --> 18:58.224
Stars are born in litters...

18:58.387 --> 19:02.062
<i>...formed from the gas and dust
of interstellar clouds.</i>

19:02.224 --> 19:06.570
<i>The mass of the individual stars in
a litter can range from the runts--</i>

19:06.729 --> 19:08.902
<i>Not much larger than the largest planets.</i>

19:09.065 --> 19:12.069
<i>--to the supergiant stars
that dwarf the sun.</i>

19:18.532 --> 19:22.207
The stars in the nebula below Orion's Belt
are newborns...

19:22.370 --> 19:24.543
...around five million years old...

19:24.705 --> 19:29.256
...and still swaddled in the gas and dust
that gave birth to them.

19:29.710 --> 19:34.557
<i>The stars in the Pleiades are already
toddlers, about 100 million years old.</i>

19:34.715 --> 19:37.059
<i>They've shed their blankets
of gas and dust...</i>

19:37.218 --> 19:40.347
<i>...but they're still bound together
by their mutual gravity.</i>

19:40.513 --> 19:42.186
<i>Another few hundred million years...</i>

19:42.348 --> 19:45.227
<i>...and they'll drift apart
and go their separate ways...</i>

19:45.393 --> 19:47.441
<i>...never to meet again.</i>

19:48.270 --> 19:51.149
<i>Most of the stars of the Big Dipper
are adolescents...</i>

19:51.315 --> 19:53.443
<i>...roughly a half a billion years old.</i>

19:53.609 --> 19:56.237
<i>They've already drifted apart
from their birth cluster...</i>

19:56.404 --> 19:59.123
<i>...although we can still trace
their common ancestry.</i>

19:59.281 --> 20:03.286
<i>Eventually, they'll spread out
around the Milky Way galaxy.</i>

20:03.452 --> 20:08.800
<i>But most of the familiar constellations
are a mix of entirely unrelated stars...</i>

20:08.958 --> 20:13.589
<i>...some faint and nearby,
others bright and far away.</i>

20:16.674 --> 20:18.221
<i>Our own sun?</i>

20:18.384 --> 20:20.682
From the distance of even a few
light-years...

20:20.845 --> 20:23.439
...it's hard to find amidst
the other stars.

20:23.973 --> 20:25.395
It's that one.

20:27.435 --> 20:30.689
Our sun is middle-aged and
a long way from where it was born.

20:30.855 --> 20:34.109
Its sister stars, hatched from
the same interstellar cloud...

20:34.275 --> 20:36.824
...are dispersed throughout
the galaxy.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.164
Many of them have
their own planets.

20:40.322 --> 20:44.623
Perhaps some of them nurture
the evolution of life and intelligence.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.781
Most of the stars in
our night sky actually

20:47.793 --> 20:50.341
orbit around one or more
stellar companions.

20:50.499 --> 20:53.378
With the naked eye, we usually
can't see the fainter members...

20:53.544 --> 20:55.797
...in such double
and multiple star systems.

20:58.674 --> 21:02.053
<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font> On a world with three suns,
the nights would be rare...</i>

21:02.219 --> 21:06.440
<i>...and the days might alternate
between red and blue.</i>

21:12.688 --> 21:15.362
<i>It is the destiny of stars to collapse.</i>

21:16.025 --> 21:19.325
<i>Of the thousands of stars you see
when you look up at the night sky...</i>

21:19.487 --> 21:23.117
<i>...every one of them is living in
an interval between two collapses:</i>

21:23.282 --> 21:27.628
<i>An initial collapse of a dark,
interstellar gas cloud to form the star...</i>

21:27.787 --> 21:32.839
<i>...and a final collapse of the luminous
star on its way to its ultimate fate.</i>

21:33.000 --> 21:37.005
Gravity makes stars contract,
unless some other force intervenes.

21:37.171 --> 21:40.926
The sun is a great big ball
of incandescent gas.

21:41.091 --> 21:45.597
The super-hot gas in its core pushes
the sun to expand outward.

21:45.763 --> 21:49.939
At the same time, the sun's own gravity
pulls it inward to contract.

21:50.100 --> 21:54.606
And our sun is poised between
these two forces in a stable equilibrium...

21:54.772 --> 21:57.776
...between gravity and nuclear fire.

21:57.942 --> 22:01.697
A balance it will maintain
for another 4 billion years.

22:01.862 --> 22:07.244
But as the sun consumes hydrogen,
its core very slowly shrinks...

22:07.409 --> 22:10.629
...and the sun's surface gradually expands
in response.

22:10.788 --> 22:15.168
It happens very slowly, imperceptibly,
over the course of millions of years.

22:15.334 --> 22:21.512
But in about a billion years, the sun will
be 1O percent brighter than it is today.

22:24.051 --> 22:26.838
Ten percent may not sound
like much, but that

22:26.850 --> 22:29.649
extra heat will have a
big effect on Earth.

22:36.981 --> 22:42.329
When the sun finally exhausts its nuclear
fuel 4 or 5 billion years from now...

22:42.486 --> 22:46.207
...its gas will cool and
the pressure will fall.

22:46.657 --> 22:50.457
The sun's interior can no longer support
the weight of the outer layers...

22:50.619 --> 22:53.793
...and the initial collapse will resume.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.467
Nothing lasts forever.

22:56.625 --> 22:58.627
Even the stars die.

22:58.794 --> 23:04.972
Helium, the ash of 10 billion years of
hydrogen fusion, has built up in the core.

23:05.134 --> 23:08.559
With no nuclear fire to sustain its weight,
the core collapses...

23:08.721 --> 23:13.477
...until it becomes hot enough to start
fusing helium into carbon and oxygen.

23:13.642 --> 23:17.692
The core of the sun is now much hotter
than it was before.

23:17.855 --> 23:19.983
Its atmosphere rapidly expands.

23:20.149 --> 23:22.948
Over the next billion years,
it'll become bloated...

23:23.110 --> 23:28.867
...to more than 100 times
its original size, a red giant star.

23:32.161 --> 23:36.667
<i>It will envelop and devour
the planets Mercury...</i>

23:39.335 --> 23:41.633
<i>...and Venus...</i>

23:45.591 --> 23:48.595
<i>...and possibly the Earth.</i>

23:50.012 --> 23:54.483
<i>I like to think that tens of millions of
years before that far distant future...</i>

23:54.642 --> 24:00.900
<i>...if there still be life born of Earth, it
will have found new homes among the stars.</i>

24:03.192 --> 24:07.618
<i>Once the sun burns through its helium,
it will become highly unstable...</i>

24:07.780 --> 24:11.034
<i>...casting off its outer layers into space.</i>

24:12.701 --> 24:14.624
<i>The exposed, super-hot core...</i>

24:14.787 --> 24:18.883
<i>...will flood its surroundings
with high-energy ultraviolet light.</i>

24:21.085 --> 24:25.386
<i>The atoms will perform a wild,
fluorescent dance.</i>

24:31.261 --> 24:34.048
The sun will collapse
like a souffle, shrinking

24:34.060 --> 24:36.859
a hundredfold to the
size of the Earth.

24:37.017 --> 24:39.611
And at that point, the
sun will be so dense...

24:39.770 --> 24:44.822
...that its overcrowded electrons will push
back, stopping any further contraction.

24:44.984 --> 24:50.081
The kernel of light at the center will be
the only part of the sun that endures...

24:50.239 --> 24:53.106
...a white dwarf star
that will go on shining

24:53.118 --> 24:55.996
dimly for another
100 billion years.

24:56.161 --> 25:00.758
Will the beings of a distant future,
sailing past this wreck of a star...

25:00.916 --> 25:05.797
...have any idea of the life and worlds
that it once warmed?

25:29.153 --> 25:33.579
<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font> The psychedelic death shrouds

<i>...before dissipating
in the interstellar gas</i>

25:40.457 --> 25:43.085
<i>and dust from which the
new stars will be born.</i>

25:48.047 --> 25:52.143
<i>The stars in a binary star system
can have a different fate.</i>

25:52.634 --> 25:57.731
<i>Sirius, the brightest star in the night
sky, has a very faint stellar companion...</i>

25:57.890 --> 25:59.563
<i>...a white dwarf.</i>

25:59.725 --> 26:02.103
<i>It was once a sun-like star.</i>

26:02.269 --> 26:06.024
<i>Someday, when Sirius runs out of fuel
and becomes a red giant...</i>

26:06.190 --> 26:09.114
<i>...it will shed its substance
onto the white dwarf.</i>

26:10.319 --> 26:13.169
<i>The intense gravity of the
companion will attract</i>

26:13.181 --> 26:16.042
<i>that gas, pulling it
into a spiraling disk.</i>

26:16.200 --> 26:20.250
<i>When the gas from the larger star falls
onto the surface of the white dwarf...</i>

26:20.412 --> 26:23.666
<i>...it will trigger nuclear explosions.</i>

26:27.419 --> 26:32.141
<i>The greatest burst will release 100,000
times more energy than the sun.</i>

26:32.299 --> 26:36.805
<i>Each one of those star bursts
is called a "nova"...</i>

26:36.970 --> 26:39.974
<i>...from the Latin for "new."</i>

26:40.140 --> 26:44.566
A star about 15 times as massive
as the sun, one like Rigel...

26:44.728 --> 26:47.327
...the blue supergiant
that forms the right

26:47.339 --> 26:49.950
foot of Orion, has a
different fate in store.

26:50.109 --> 26:53.363
Its collapse will not be stopped
by the pressure of electrons.

26:55.447 --> 26:58.291
The star will keep falling in on itself...

26:58.784 --> 27:03.711
...until its nuclei become so overcrowded
that they push back.

27:06.708 --> 27:09.928
Rigel will shrink down
about 100,000 times...

27:10.087 --> 27:15.218
...until there's no space left between
the nuclei and it can shrink no more.

27:19.888 --> 27:25.395
At that point, it ignites a more powerful
nuclear reaction: A supernova.

27:30.899 --> 27:34.574
Most stellar evolution takes millions
or billions of years.

27:34.736 --> 27:39.082
But the interior collapse that triggers
a supernova explosion takes only seconds.

27:39.741 --> 27:44.588
What remains will be an atomic nucleus
the size of a small city...

27:44.746 --> 27:49.172
...a rapidly rotating
neutron star called a pulsar.

28:01.763 --> 28:05.188
<i>But for a star more than 30 times
as massive as the sun...</i>

28:05.350 --> 28:11.153
<i>...a star like Alnilam in Orion's Belt,
there will be no stopping its collapse.</i>

28:11.315 --> 28:16.867
<i>In a few million years, when Alnilam runs
out of fuel, it, too, will go supernova.</i>

28:17.029 --> 28:22.081
<i>The imploding core of Alnilam
will be so massive...</i>

28:22.242 --> 28:26.793
<i>...that not even nuclear forces will be
strong enough to hold off its collapse.</i>

28:26.955 --> 28:29.299
<i>Nothing can withstand such gravity.</i>

28:29.458 --> 28:32.962
<i>And such a star has an astonishing destiny.</i>

28:36.882 --> 28:41.137
<i>It will continue to collapse,
crossing a boundary in space-time...</i>

28:41.303 --> 28:45.558
<i>...called the "event horizon,"
beyond which we cannot see.</i>

28:46.475 --> 28:50.981
<i>When it traverses that frontier,
the star will vanish completely from sight.</i>

28:52.981 --> 28:57.657
<i>It will be inside a black hole,
a place where gravity is so strong...</i>

28:57.819 --> 29:01.449
<i>...that nothing, not
even light, can escape.</i>

29:06.995 --> 29:11.000
But there's an even more dramatic fate
that awaits a rare kind of star.

29:11.166 --> 29:12.918
There's one of them in our galaxy.

29:13.085 --> 29:19.092
It's so unstable that when it goes,
it won't become a mere nova or supernova.

29:19.258 --> 29:24.059
It'll become something far more
catastrophic: A hypernova.

29:24.346 --> 29:26.690
And it could happen in our lifetime.

29:37.609 --> 29:41.489
<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font> There are few places on Earth

No buildings, no cars, streetlights,
nothing out here, just lots of starlight.

And the occasional kangaroo.

29:55.127 --> 29:58.347
You can get a particularly good view
of the Milky Way from down here.

29:58.505 --> 30:04.137
The center of our galaxy rises high in the
sky, and it arches across the heavens...

30:04.303 --> 30:06.476
...like the backbone of night.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.481
<i>We live in a spiral galaxy.</i>

30:08.640 --> 30:10.267
<i>And when we look at the Milky Way...</i>

<i>...we're seeing light from billions
of stars in its spiral disk.</i>

30:14.438 --> 30:17.493
<i>And under this beautiful
dark sky, you can see</i>

30:17.505 --> 30:20.571
<i>that the Milky Way isn't
a uniform band of light.</i>

30:20.736 --> 30:23.740
<i>There are dark patches,
breaks in the starlight.</i>

30:23.905 --> 30:27.330
<i>Those dark patches
are caused by interstellar dust.</i>

30:27.492 --> 30:31.042
<i>The dust blocks the starlight,
and there's lots of it.</i>

30:32.497 --> 30:36.343
<i>Most cultures looked up at the stars
and connected the dots...</i>

30:36.501 --> 30:38.845
<i>...to form familiar images in the sky.</i>

30:39.004 --> 30:41.052
<i>Constellations.</i>

30:46.345 --> 30:50.691
But the Aboriginal people of Australia
saw a pattern in the darkness...

30:50.849 --> 30:52.817
...running through the Milky Way.

30:52.976 --> 30:57.903
They saw an emu,
a large bird native to this continent.

30:58.065 --> 31:01.945
<i>Not in the stars,
but in the absence of stars.</i>

31:04.905 --> 31:07.408
There are so many ways
to look at the night sky.

31:07.574 --> 31:10.453
For a million years or more,
we've watched the sky.

31:10.619 --> 31:12.246
And a lot's happened in that time.

31:12.412 --> 31:16.292
Supernova explode in our galaxy
about once a century.

31:16.458 --> 31:21.385
If we could compress all those nights
of stargazing into a single minute...

31:21.546 --> 31:24.425
...this is what we would see.

31:29.012 --> 31:30.685
Now, if our eyes were telescopes...

31:30.847 --> 31:33.817
...if they were light buckets
as big as wagon wheels...

31:33.975 --> 31:37.149
...and our vision was not limited
to just one kind of light...

31:37.312 --> 31:40.316
...then this is the Milky Way
we would see.

31:42.442 --> 31:46.663
<i>A galaxy in near-infrared light
with streaming tendrils of dust...</i>

32:46.381 --> 32:49.260
<i>Its substance is propelled
across the vastness...</i>

32:49.426 --> 32:52.976
<i>...to be stirred by starlight
and gathered up by gravity.</i>

32:53.555 --> 32:57.605
<i>Stars to dust and dust to stars.</i>

32:58.185 --> 33:01.234
<i>In the cosmos, nothing is wasted.</i>

33:03.273 --> 33:07.278
<i>But there's an upper limit
to how massive a star can be.</i>

33:09.362 --> 33:12.707
<i>Back in the 17th century,
when Edmond Halley crossed the equator...</i>

33:12.866 --> 33:14.743
<i>...to map the southern constellations...</i>

33:14.910 --> 33:18.005
<i>...Eta Carinae seemed like
just another faint star.</i>

33:18.163 --> 33:23.715
<i>But in 1843, Eta Carinae suddenly became
the second brightest star in the sky...</i>

33:23.877 --> 33:25.879
<i>...outshined only by Sirius.</i>

33:26.046 --> 33:29.095
<i>And it's been ï¬‚ipping out ever since.</i>

33:31.468 --> 33:36.599
<i>That dumbbell-shaped cloud
is the expanding remnant of that event.</i>

33:41.102 --> 33:44.276
<i>At its center is one crazy star.</i>

33:44.439 --> 33:47.016
<i>Talk about unstable, Eta
Carinae is at least</i>

33:47.028 --> 33:49.616
<i>100 times more massive
than the sun...</i>

33:49.778 --> 33:53.533
<i>...and pouring out 5
million times more light.</i>

33:53.698 --> 33:57.703
<i>It's pushing the upper limit
of what a star can be.</i>

33:58.828 --> 34:01.154
<i>What's more, there's
evidence that Eta Carinae</i>

34:01.166 --> 34:03.504
<i>is being gravitationally
tormented...</i>

34:03.667 --> 34:05.385
<i>...by an evil twin...</i>

34:05.544 --> 34:11.597
<i>...another massive star in orbit around it
as close as Saturn is to the sun.</i>

34:12.300 --> 34:15.975
<i>The core of a supermassive star
pours out so much light...</i>

34:16.137 --> 34:20.108
<i>...that the outward pressure can overwhelm
the star's gravity.</i>

34:20.266 --> 34:24.773
<i>If a star is too massive, its radiation
pressure overpowers its gravity...</i>

34:24.938 --> 34:27.282
<i>...and blows the star apart.</i>

34:29.317 --> 34:33.914
The fate of Eta Carinae was sealed
when it was born millions of years ago.

34:34.072 --> 34:38.498
When it finally does blow up--
And who knows, maybe it already has...

34:38.659 --> 34:43.291
...after all we're looking at it by light
that left the star 7500 years ago.

34:43.456 --> 34:47.632
--It will be a cataclysm
unlike anything we've seen before.

34:48.003 --> 34:49.175
A hypernova.

35:01.516 --> 35:04.019
<i>An explosion so powerful,
it'll make a supernova...</i>

35:04.185 --> 35:06.938
<i>...seem like a firecracker by comparison.</i>

35:07.689 --> 35:10.431
<i>If there are nearby solar
systems with planets</i>

35:10.443 --> 35:13.196
<i>harboring life, their
days are numbered.</i>

35:13.695 --> 35:17.165
A hypernova spews
so much radiation into space...

35:17.324 --> 35:20.328
...not just light, but
x-rays and gamma rays...

35:20.493 --> 35:24.623
...that planets that are dozens,
or perhaps hundreds of light-years away...

35:24.789 --> 35:29.465
...could be stripped of their atmospheres
and bathed in deadly radiation.

35:29.628 --> 35:33.508
It would wreak havoc in thousands
of nearby star systems.

35:34.424 --> 35:36.893
Right about now,
you're probably asking yourself:

35:37.052 --> 35:38.599
"Are we safe?"

35:39.054 --> 35:43.651
If Eta Carinae blows up,
what happens to Earth?

35:44.225 --> 35:47.104
<i>Rest assured, Earth will be just fine.</i>

35:47.270 --> 35:50.900
<i>Remember, we're 7500 light-years away
from Eta Carinae.</i>

35:51.066 --> 35:54.246
<i>The intensity of radiation
from a star, even an</i>

35:54.258 --> 35:57.449
<i>exploding star, falls off
rapidly with distance.</i>

35:57.614 --> 36:02.415
<i>But still, Eta Carinae in its death throes
will put on quite a show.</i>

36:02.577 --> 36:05.205
<i>It will light up the night
of the southern hemisphere...</i>

36:05.372 --> 36:07.215
<i>...with the brightness of a second moon.</i>

36:07.374 --> 36:11.720
<i>The most dramatic swan song
a star can sing.</i>

36:17.926 --> 36:20.645
<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font>
Our ancestors worshiped the sun.</i>

36:20.970 --> 36:22.893
<i>And they were far from foolish.</i>

36:23.932 --> 36:29.484
It makes good sense to revere the sun
and stars, because we are their children.

36:29.646 --> 36:34.652
The silicon in the rocks, the oxygen
in the air, the carbon in our DNA...

36:34.818 --> 36:38.539
...the iron in our skyscrapers,
the silver in ourjewelry...

36:38.697 --> 36:42.622
...were all made in stars
billions of years ago.

36:42.784 --> 36:48.712
Our planet, our society,
and we ourselves are stardust.

36:50.500 --> 36:53.424
Well, what is it that
makes the atoms dance?

36:53.586 --> 36:59.389
How is the energy of a star transformed
into everything that happens in the world?

37:00.009 --> 37:03.479
What is energy? We're awash in it.

37:03.638 --> 37:07.984
When hydrogen atoms fuse inside the sun,
they make helium atoms.

37:08.143 --> 37:10.396
And this fusion emits a burst of energy...

37:10.562 --> 37:13.491
...that can wander inside
the sun for 1O million

37:13.503 --> 37:16.444
years before making its
way to the surface.

37:16.609 --> 37:23.037
And once there, it's free to fly straight
from the sun to the Earth as visible light.

37:23.992 --> 37:26.529
If it should strike the
surface of a leaf, it

37:26.541 --> 37:29.089
will be stored in the
plant as chemical energy.

37:30.331 --> 37:31.958
Sunshine...

37:32.292 --> 37:33.509
...into moonshine.

37:44.220 --> 37:46.348
<font color="#D900D9">(BOTH SPEAK IN ITALIAN)</font>

37:53.062 --> 37:56.692
I can feel my brain turning
the chemical energy of the wine...

37:56.858 --> 37:59.031
...into the electrical
energy of my thoughts...

37:59.194 --> 38:03.665
...and directing my vocal chords to produce
the acoustic energy of my voice.

38:04.032 --> 38:08.378
Such transformations of energy
are happening everywhere all the time.

38:08.870 --> 38:13.876
Energy from our star drives the wind
and the waves and the life around us.

38:14.042 --> 38:17.797
How lucky we are to have this vast source
of clean energy...

38:17.962 --> 38:21.091
...falling like manna from heaven
on all of us.

38:22.008 --> 38:26.730
To Annie Jump Cannon,
Henrietta Swan Leavitt and Cecilia Payne...

38:26.888 --> 38:30.233
...for blazing the trail
to modern astrophysics.

38:30.391 --> 38:33.270
And to all the sisters of the sun.

38:39.567 --> 38:43.413
<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font> There's no refuge
from change in the cosmos.</i>

38:44.072 --> 38:46.621
Some 10 or 2O million years from now...

38:46.783 --> 38:49.673
...it'll seem for a
cosmic moment as if Orion

38:49.685 --> 38:52.586
is finally about to catch
the seven sisters.

38:53.039 --> 38:58.796
But before he has them in his clutches, the
biggest stars of Orion will go supernova.

38:58.962 --> 39:02.182
Orion's pursuit of the Pleiades
will finally end...

39:02.340 --> 39:05.377
...and the seven sisters
will glide serenely

39:05.389 --> 39:08.438
into the waiting arms
of the Milky Way.

39:11.558 --> 39:17.281
<i>We on Earth marvel, and rightly so,
at the return of our solitary sun.</i>

39:17.438 --> 39:21.033
<i>But from a planet orbiting a star
in a distant globular cluster...</i>

39:21.192 --> 39:24.492
<i>...a still more glorious dawn awaits.</i>

39:25.572 --> 39:27.415
<i>Not a sunrise...</i>

39:28.449 --> 39:30.622
<i>...but a galaxy rise.</i>

39:30.785 --> 39:35.006
<i>A morning filled with 200 billion suns.</i>

39:35.164 --> 39:38.293
<i>The rising of the Milky Way.</i>

39:38.459 --> 39:42.089
<i>An enormous spiral form
with collapsing gas clouds...</i>

39:42.255 --> 39:45.850
<i>...condensing planetary systems,
luminous supergiants...</i>

39:46.009 --> 39:47.886
<i>...stable middle-aged suns...</i>

39:48.052 --> 39:50.976
<i>...red giants, white dwarfs,
planetary nebulae...</i>

39:51.139 --> 39:55.064
<i>...supernovas, neutron stars, pulsars,
black holes.</i>

reason to think, other</i>

<i>From such a world,
high above the Milky Way...</i>

40:05.361 --> 40:10.162

to be clear on our world...</i>

by the great and ancient cosmos...</i>
