00:40.652 --> 00:41.552
911 dispatch.

00:41.554 --> 00:43.622
What's the emergency?

00:43.624 --> 00:45.957
There's been an accident.

00:45.959 --> 00:48.293
What's the location?

00:48.295 --> 00:50.128
9 Summit Street.

00:54.101 --> 00:56.302
Sugar.

00:56.304 --> 01:00.574
I call my baby my sugar.

01:00.576 --> 01:04.944
I never maybe my sugar.

01:04.947 --> 01:11.754
That's 'cause my baby's
so confectionary.

01:11.756 --> 01:17.993
Funny, he never
asks for my money,

01:17.995 --> 01:22.466
'long as I feed him on honey.

01:22.468 --> 01:24.767
That he can get anytime.

01:24.769 --> 01:27.103
Walter!

01:27.105 --> 01:28.972
I'm making breakfast.

01:35.615 --> 01:37.348
You want French toast?

01:37.350 --> 01:39.251
I'm making French toast!

02:34.251 --> 02:34.815
Hey!

02:34.817 --> 02:36.151
Hey, are you OK?

02:47.399 --> 02:49.364
Like that.

02:49.366 --> 02:51.835
Try it again.

02:54.306 --> 02:55.405
Excuse me.

02:55.407 --> 02:56.941
Ms. Olson, you have a call.

02:56.943 --> 02:57.976
It's one of your neighbors.

02:57.978 --> 02:59.143
It happened so fast.

02:59.145 --> 03:00.977
Where were you?

03:00.979 --> 03:02.947
I was home, working in
my yard just over there.

03:02.949 --> 03:05.282
Over there.

03:05.284 --> 03:06.417
Tough pendejo, though, huh?

03:06.419 --> 03:08.588
Step right in front of a car.

03:08.590 --> 03:09.922
I thought for sure
when I ran down here,

03:09.924 --> 03:11.656
he'd be in bad shape, but...

03:11.658 --> 03:13.226
You know him?

03:13.228 --> 03:13.827
Uh, not so much.

03:13.829 --> 03:16.062
Just a wave.

03:16.064 --> 03:18.965
You know Wren Miller,
17B Green Street?

03:18.967 --> 03:21.969
She reported the accident.

03:21.971 --> 03:24.472
Never heard of her.

03:51.406 --> 03:51.971
Police!

03:51.973 --> 03:52.806
Anybody home?

04:06.389 --> 04:06.921
Hello?

04:06.923 --> 04:08.289
Miss Miller?

05:53.980 --> 05:55.478
Young lady!

05:55.480 --> 05:56.714
Hey!

05:56.716 --> 06:00.985
27 hours I have been getting
on and off the airplane.

06:00.987 --> 06:04.656
It's 27 hours.

06:05.425 --> 06:06.892
Why are your eyes puffy?

06:06.894 --> 06:09.262
Have you been eating?

06:09.264 --> 06:10.965
Don't you start with me.

06:14.571 --> 06:16.671
See, this is why the
doctor said you should get

06:16.673 --> 06:17.938
up every two hours and walk.

06:17.940 --> 06:19.572
I like to sit.

06:19.574 --> 06:22.043
Well, he wants you to
talk so you keep the blood

06:22.045 --> 06:23.211
flowing in your veins.

06:23.213 --> 06:25.781
My blood is flowing, Jo Jo.

06:25.783 --> 06:28.317
It's my joints who
won't cooperate.

06:28.319 --> 06:30.019
How are your joints, Donna?

06:30.021 --> 06:31.288
My joints are great.

06:31.290 --> 06:32.255
They're cooperating?

06:32.257 --> 06:33.690
My joints are cooperating.

06:33.692 --> 06:35.158
I bet they are.

06:37.062 --> 06:38.195
So how are things?

06:38.197 --> 06:39.562
Well, Mr. Lemke
tried to kill himself.

06:39.564 --> 06:40.432
Oh, no.

06:40.434 --> 06:41.598
Not again.

06:41.600 --> 06:42.700
Poor Margaret.

06:42.702 --> 06:44.702
Mr. Lemke is
a horse's ass, Jo Jo.

06:44.704 --> 06:45.803
Yes.

06:45.805 --> 06:47.305
I... I've told
her a thousand times.

06:47.307 --> 06:48.740
Well, why does
he keep doing that?

06:48.742 --> 06:51.678
He's gonna die soon enough
as it is without sending

06:51.680 --> 06:53.546
Margaret into hysterics.

06:53.548 --> 06:54.613
I know.

06:54.615 --> 06:55.748
It's just terrible.

06:55.750 --> 06:56.548
We should go over there.

06:56.550 --> 06:57.817
No.

06:57.819 --> 06:58.651
No, he's fine.

06:58.653 --> 07:00.353
They took him to the hospital.

07:00.355 --> 07:02.656
Not a nice welcome
for my new tenant,

07:02.658 --> 07:04.159
but what are you gonna do?

07:04.161 --> 07:05.860
You found someone
to take the apartment?

07:05.862 --> 07:06.360
Yeah.

07:06.362 --> 07:07.161
Single?

07:07.163 --> 07:07.995
- Stop it.
- Male?

07:07.997 --> 07:09.130
Female?

07:09.132 --> 07:11.767
I don't know anything
about the young lady.

07:11.769 --> 07:12.534
Uh-huh?

07:12.536 --> 07:14.235
And I don't want to know.

07:14.237 --> 07:17.106
You become less fun
the longer I know you.

07:17.108 --> 07:18.007
Thank you so much!

07:18.009 --> 07:21.846
Is she home?

07:21.848 --> 07:23.514
I think she's home.

07:23.516 --> 07:24.815
Why don't we get you home?

07:24.817 --> 07:26.416
Yeah, all right.

07:26.418 --> 07:27.452
OK?

07:27.454 --> 07:29.387
Arnie,
where are you going?

07:29.389 --> 07:30.988
We have a whole car to unload.

07:30.990 --> 07:33.091
Well, if I lift anything,
my arm'll fall off.

07:34.362 --> 07:37.096
I've been married to
that man for 41 years.

07:37.098 --> 07:38.298
I know.

07:38.300 --> 07:41.466
And I don't think he's
ever carried his suitcase.

09:37.203 --> 09:41.705
I can see this is me.

09:41.707 --> 09:44.007
I will be.

09:44.009 --> 09:46.878
You'll all see I'm the one.

09:56.525 --> 09:57.959
Oh, sorry.

09:57.961 --> 09:58.925
You are way too happy.

09:58.927 --> 10:00.962
There's no such thing.

10:00.964 --> 10:01.662
I get to be outside.

10:01.664 --> 10:03.931
I... I get to exercise.

10:03.933 --> 10:04.800
I get to meet people.

10:04.802 --> 10:06.068
I get a...

10:06.070 --> 10:06.736
A pension.

10:06.738 --> 10:08.036
I get a pension.

10:08.038 --> 10:08.871
Health care.

10:08.873 --> 10:10.006
I get health care.

10:10.008 --> 10:10.805
Vacations.

10:10.807 --> 10:11.306
See?

10:11.308 --> 10:12.275
Who knows?

10:12.277 --> 10:13.709
But wait, job lover.

10:13.711 --> 10:14.577
There's more.

10:17.582 --> 10:20.084
Goes to one address.

10:20.086 --> 10:21.819
Huh.

10:21.821 --> 10:22.219
Whoa.

10:25.557 --> 10:27.458
You missed a spot.

10:50.320 --> 10:50.719
He's back.

10:54.524 --> 10:56.025
Would you stop?

10:56.027 --> 10:57.060
Shh.

10:57.062 --> 10:58.127
Arnie.

10:58.129 --> 10:59.027
What?

10:59.029 --> 11:00.630
They can't hear me.

11:03.735 --> 11:05.936
She's leaving him.

11:05.938 --> 11:08.607
Gotta be the smartest
thing she's ever done.

11:08.609 --> 11:11.175
Huh.

11:11.177 --> 11:13.079
Look at that.

11:13.081 --> 11:15.848
He is just sitting
there in his front yard.

11:15.850 --> 11:17.181
So?

11:17.183 --> 11:20.419
We're just sitting
here in our front yard.

11:20.421 --> 11:21.354
Do you need anything?

11:25.860 --> 11:27.228
I'm going over there.

11:27.230 --> 11:29.829
Jo... what?

11:29.831 --> 11:32.099
Are you taking your chair?

11:32.101 --> 11:32.767
Yes!

11:32.769 --> 11:34.469
I'm taking my chair.

12:06.140 --> 12:07.574
Holy cow.

12:07.576 --> 12:09.142
Hey, Mr. B.

12:09.144 --> 12:11.344
What are you bringing
me there, baby pigs?

12:11.346 --> 12:14.415
No, it's
actually not for you.

12:14.417 --> 12:17.017
Goes up there.

12:17.019 --> 12:19.588
Where's Jo Ann?

12:19.590 --> 12:21.490
She's found another man.

12:25.062 --> 12:34.537
Hello, Walt. Oh, my.

12:34.539 --> 12:35.438
This is nice.

12:55.730 --> 12:56.965
Pygmy Falcon.

12:59.668 --> 13:01.802
Yes, it... it is.

13:01.804 --> 13:02.969
I'm Wren.

13:02.971 --> 13:05.839
I moved in while the
two of you were away.

13:05.841 --> 13:07.209
Ah.

13:07.211 --> 13:14.951
Well, uh... I don't remember
seeing this when I was there.

13:14.953 --> 13:18.155
I mean, I didn't see...

13:18.157 --> 13:22.026
I know I didn't see it.

13:22.028 --> 13:25.230
But here it is.

13:25.232 --> 13:27.632
Oh, I'm Arnie.

13:27.634 --> 13:29.035
Arnie Bayberry.

13:29.037 --> 13:31.036
Nice to meet you.

13:31.038 --> 13:31.536
Careful.

13:31.538 --> 13:32.171
Whoa.

13:32.173 --> 13:32.871
Watch your birds.

13:37.513 --> 13:38.478
How was Africa?

13:38.480 --> 13:39.813
It was good.

13:39.815 --> 13:42.282
You didn't go out and find a
girlfriend while I was gone,

13:42.284 --> 13:43.884
did you?

13:43.886 --> 13:44.853
Uh, no.

13:44.855 --> 13:46.286
No, ma'am.

13:46.288 --> 13:47.154
Still single.

13:50.293 --> 13:53.028
Oh.

13:53.030 --> 13:54.298
That must be here.

13:57.735 --> 14:00.103
Oh, she's lovely, isn't she?

14:00.105 --> 14:02.738
She's just lovely.

14:02.740 --> 14:03.706
Who is she?

14:03.708 --> 14:05.443
My new neighbor.

14:05.445 --> 14:07.111
The one who
lives above the garage?

14:07.113 --> 14:09.381
Yeah.

14:09.383 --> 14:12.984
I should go introduce
myself to her.

14:12.986 --> 14:15.555
She gets a lot of mail.

14:15.557 --> 14:18.424
Hello, hello, hello.

14:18.426 --> 14:20.092
Oh, look at you.

14:20.094 --> 14:22.162
You are just lovely.

14:22.164 --> 14:24.730
I almost stopped
by this morning,

14:24.732 --> 14:26.901
but my husband told me not
to knock on anybody's doors

14:26.903 --> 14:28.903
- until 9:00 AM.
- Hi.

14:28.905 --> 14:30.103
I'm Wren.

14:30.105 --> 14:30.805
Hi.

14:30.807 --> 14:33.041
Oh, wow, look at that.

14:33.043 --> 14:35.711
Where in the world are you
going with all of that?

14:39.583 --> 14:41.916
Oh, my.

14:41.918 --> 14:44.954
Isn't it a beautiful day?

14:44.956 --> 14:47.723
I live right next to you
with my husband Arnie.

14:47.725 --> 14:49.392
I was just mentioning to Josh.

14:49.394 --> 14:53.263
He's the nice young mailman over
there, sitting with Mr. Lemke.

14:53.265 --> 14:54.164
Let's wave.

14:59.506 --> 15:00.540
Josh is single.

15:00.542 --> 15:03.575
His mother died last
year, poor thing.

15:03.577 --> 15:05.012
And he was there the whole time.

15:05.014 --> 15:06.647
They don't get any
better than that.

15:06.649 --> 15:08.915
He's the real deal.

15:08.917 --> 15:11.050
Are you single?

15:11.052 --> 15:12.752
Here, let's walk.

15:12.754 --> 15:15.455
I can tell you all you need to
know about this neighborhood,

15:15.457 --> 15:17.959
but today I'm kind
of busy 'cause I have

15:17.961 --> 15:19.594
to keep my eyes on Mr. Lemke.

15:19.596 --> 15:23.666
It can be so bad sometimes
this whole getting older bit.

15:23.668 --> 15:27.371
But maybe later if you
want, I'll just stop by.

15:27.373 --> 15:28.906
What's your name again?

15:28.908 --> 15:29.940
Wren.

15:29.942 --> 15:31.141
Wren.

15:31.143 --> 15:33.611
Well, you are darn cute, Wren.

15:33.613 --> 15:36.147
Are you insane?

15:36.149 --> 15:37.882
Are you insane?
Hey!

15:37.884 --> 15:40.386
- Knock it off.
- Are you insane?

15:40.388 --> 15:43.153
Yes, definitely.

15:43.155 --> 15:44.156
Hey, Payne.

15:44.158 --> 15:45.924
You've been
blessed by a bird.

15:45.926 --> 15:46.326
Hm?

15:51.099 --> 15:51.797
Oh.

15:51.799 --> 15:52.799
No, come on, man.

15:52.801 --> 15:53.666
You should be happy.

15:53.668 --> 15:55.069
That's good luck.

15:55.071 --> 15:57.405
In fact, the next time you go
back out, why don't you pick me

15:57.407 --> 15:59.273
up $20 bucks in scratch-offs.

15:59.275 --> 16:04.213
And if I win, then
we'll split it 60-40.

16:04.215 --> 16:07.682
Maybe 50-50.

16:07.684 --> 16:08.318
OK.

16:08.320 --> 16:09.852
Take that as a no.

16:09.854 --> 16:11.387
Well, I'll take that
to your box, too.

16:12.625 --> 16:15.224
Or, you know, you
could go online.

16:15.226 --> 16:17.828
Blackjack, poker.
Trust me.

16:17.830 --> 16:18.829
This is a sign.

16:18.831 --> 16:20.765
Technology is overrated.

16:20.767 --> 16:21.531
Is it now?

16:21.533 --> 16:24.102
I was on this dating site.

16:24.104 --> 16:26.371
Met this woman for
drinks last week.

16:26.373 --> 16:27.406
Mm-hm?

16:27.408 --> 16:32.078
Matea from Oraro, Tonga.

16:34.250 --> 16:36.316
I'm telling you, man.

16:36.318 --> 16:39.020
There are all types
of people on there.

16:39.022 --> 16:40.153
What's it been, man?

16:40.155 --> 16:42.791
Six, seven years?

16:42.793 --> 16:44.192
This could be your jam.

16:48.264 --> 16:49.630
Here you go, Payne.

17:00.980 --> 17:02.813
A pygmy falcon?

17:02.815 --> 17:03.881
You're kidding.

17:03.883 --> 17:04.382
No, no.

17:04.384 --> 17:04.949
Really.

17:04.951 --> 17:05.782
Where is it?

17:05.785 --> 17:06.951
That's remarkable!

17:06.953 --> 17:08.487
Where'd you see it?

17:08.489 --> 17:09.286
Huh?

17:09.288 --> 17:10.321
Where'd you see it?

17:10.324 --> 17:12.324
You know, it's funny.

17:12.326 --> 17:13.859
I can't recall exactly.

17:13.862 --> 17:15.761
You can't recall?

17:15.762 --> 17:16.997
Arnie, you're a professional.

17:16.999 --> 17:19.266
You can't make claims
without proper verification.

17:19.268 --> 17:21.066
I'm not making a claim.

17:21.068 --> 17:23.469
This is just you and me talking.

17:23.471 --> 17:25.271
I don't mean to challenge you.

17:25.272 --> 17:27.107
I'm just surprised is all.

17:27.108 --> 17:27.940
I know.

17:27.942 --> 17:29.277
It's strange.

17:29.279 --> 17:32.279
All right, I just came across
the photo when I got back.

17:32.281 --> 17:35.084
I don't even remember taking it.

17:35.086 --> 17:37.152
Look, don't worry.

17:37.154 --> 17:41.658
Now I can't even find
the friggin' thing.

17:41.660 --> 17:46.163
Well, they are pretty small.

17:57.978 --> 17:59.944
Oh, thank goodness
you're home.

17:59.946 --> 18:01.614
Can I come in?

18:01.616 --> 18:02.649
Sure.

18:02.651 --> 18:03.883
It's for you.

18:03.885 --> 18:04.651
Go ahead.

18:04.653 --> 18:05.284
Open it.

18:05.286 --> 18:07.054
Oh.

18:07.056 --> 18:08.188
You didn't have to do that.

18:08.190 --> 18:08.590
Oh.

18:11.595 --> 18:13.595
- It's a meatball maker.
- Oh.

18:16.733 --> 18:17.565
OK, thanks.

18:17.567 --> 18:20.036
I ordered a ton of 'em on QVC.

18:20.038 --> 18:22.738
It's one of those
things everybody needs.

18:22.740 --> 18:24.307
You know how to work this?

18:24.309 --> 18:25.609
Um, well...

18:25.611 --> 18:29.645
See, you just spread the
seasoned meat on a counter,

18:29.647 --> 18:33.584
and then you press the plastic
gizmo down through the meat.

18:33.586 --> 18:36.554
Shake it around, open
it up, and voila.

18:36.556 --> 18:37.921
Perfect meatballs.

18:37.923 --> 18:38.957
It's amazing.

18:38.959 --> 18:40.359
You're gonna love it.

18:40.361 --> 18:42.061
I use mine all the time.

18:42.063 --> 18:43.429
Thank you.

18:43.431 --> 18:46.033
I'll just, um...

18:46.035 --> 18:48.168
I'll set it right here.

18:48.170 --> 18:48.568
Yeah.

18:51.507 --> 18:52.574
Wow.

18:52.576 --> 18:55.343
I thought only old
people still got mail.

18:55.345 --> 18:57.313
What do you do with it?

18:57.315 --> 18:58.446
I read it.

18:58.448 --> 18:59.547
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

18:59.549 --> 19:01.615
Nobody could read all this.

19:01.617 --> 19:02.883
Is it for work?

19:02.885 --> 19:03.853
What do you do?

19:03.855 --> 19:05.688
I... I really can't say.

19:05.690 --> 19:06.220
Oh, please.

19:06.222 --> 19:06.988
Don't worry.

19:06.990 --> 19:08.757
People tell me everything.

19:08.759 --> 19:10.693
I'm kind of like a priest.

19:10.695 --> 19:11.594
It's complicated.

19:11.596 --> 19:13.197
- It's complicated?
- It can be.

19:13.199 --> 19:18.569
Aways complicated, or is it
sometimes less complicated?

19:18.571 --> 19:20.037
Finally, a human.

19:20.039 --> 19:22.373
No, no, I'm not Caleb Murphy.

19:22.375 --> 19:23.709
That's the problem.

19:23.711 --> 19:24.843
My name is Moody Burkheart.

19:27.749 --> 19:29.815
B-U-R-K-heart.

19:29.817 --> 19:32.084
And something's gone
wrong with your system,

19:32.086 --> 19:35.889
because I'm not getting Caleb
Murphy's bill at my address.

19:35.891 --> 19:38.259
But I'm not getting my own bill.

19:46.538 --> 19:49.837
Uh, what?

19:49.839 --> 19:50.240
OK.

19:53.846 --> 19:58.115
So only Caleb Murphy can
make changes to this account.

19:58.117 --> 19:58.650
Uh-huh.

19:58.652 --> 20:00.151
It's policy.

20:00.153 --> 20:02.620
It's not policy.

20:02.622 --> 20:03.488
It's a mistake.

20:36.662 --> 20:38.728
I can't believe how
far along you are.

20:38.730 --> 20:41.196
Getting that lining
in was harder

20:41.198 --> 20:42.432
than building the casket.

20:42.434 --> 20:45.035
It's... it's...

20:45.037 --> 20:46.469
it's creepy.

20:46.471 --> 20:47.004
It's creepy!

20:48.909 --> 20:50.775
Arnie says it's creepy.

20:50.777 --> 20:52.343
It's... it's creepy.

20:52.345 --> 20:55.279
But it's no secret we're
all gonna die someday.

20:55.281 --> 20:56.748
Do you know how expensive it is?

20:56.750 --> 20:57.481
To die?

20:57.483 --> 20:59.419
Yeah, horribly expensive.

20:59.421 --> 21:01.453
$10,000 on average.

21:01.455 --> 21:03.757
It just makes me
sick to my stomach

21:03.759 --> 21:06.927
that just to lay a
person to rest families

21:06.929 --> 21:08.328
have to pay that kind of money.

21:08.330 --> 21:08.996
Hm.

21:08.998 --> 21:10.030
Oh!

21:10.032 --> 21:11.467
I can't believe I
forgot to tell you.

21:11.469 --> 21:12.399
I met Wren.

21:12.401 --> 21:14.902
She's a lovely
girl, just lovely.

21:14.904 --> 21:18.940
We had a great walk, and
I went to her house and...

21:18.942 --> 21:21.111
but did you know
about the mail thing?

21:21.113 --> 21:24.546
She gets hundreds, thousands
of letters every day.

21:24.548 --> 21:25.716
Hm.

21:25.718 --> 21:28.251
She must be some
sort of speed reader.

21:28.253 --> 21:29.385
Jo Ann.

21:29.387 --> 21:31.957
Anyway, I've been
thinking about it.

21:31.959 --> 21:34.726
Because, you know,
something is going on there,

21:34.728 --> 21:37.764
and I think I finally
figured it out.

21:37.766 --> 21:43.504
I am pretty sure she is
a pen pal for prisoners.

21:43.506 --> 21:44.403
A what?

21:44.405 --> 21:46.538
I'm talking lots of prisoners.

21:46.540 --> 21:49.142
You should see
these bags, and she

21:49.144 --> 21:50.442
doesn't want to talk about it.

21:50.444 --> 21:51.911
"It's complicated."

21:51.913 --> 21:52.746
Her words.

21:52.748 --> 21:54.882
I mean, what else could it be?

21:54.884 --> 21:56.584
She's a pen pal for prisoners?

21:56.586 --> 21:58.886
It really is the only
thing that makes sense.

21:58.888 --> 22:00.823
Well, so what if she is?

22:00.825 --> 22:02.157
Well, here's the thing.

22:02.159 --> 22:05.295
I think she thinks
that we'll care.

22:05.297 --> 22:06.863
That's why she won't
tell me about it.

22:06.865 --> 22:09.164
Yeah, but, Jo Ann, everybody
that lives next to you

22:09.166 --> 22:10.834
doesn't need you to
worry about them.

22:10.836 --> 22:11.769
I'm not.

22:11.771 --> 22:12.603
You are.

22:12.605 --> 22:14.505
Or was it somebody else who...

22:14.507 --> 22:16.574
who called the police
because Mark was

22:16.576 --> 22:17.741
having sex with his girlfriend.

22:17.743 --> 22:19.276
I saw smoke.

22:19.278 --> 22:21.912
And chaperoning Mr. Lemke.

22:21.914 --> 22:23.715
Well, life's my company.

22:23.717 --> 22:27.754
And... and what about when
I helped with Desmond

22:27.756 --> 22:29.623
when you were in Cincinnati?

22:36.332 --> 22:37.096
That was Cleveland.

22:37.098 --> 22:39.867
I was in Cleveland.

22:39.869 --> 22:40.669
Cleveland.

22:40.671 --> 22:42.536
I'm sorry.

22:42.538 --> 22:44.606
Wherever, I was on guard.

22:44.608 --> 22:46.241
Yeah, but nobody
needed your help.

22:46.243 --> 22:49.513
You're too nosy, Jo Ann.

22:49.515 --> 22:52.146
I'm caring.

22:52.148 --> 22:54.117
Look, Wren's a nice girl.

22:54.119 --> 22:55.017
She gets a lot of mail.

22:55.019 --> 22:57.487
So what?

22:57.489 --> 23:02.294
That's a really
beautiful casket.

23:05.266 --> 23:06.864
I realize
it's a promotion,

23:06.866 --> 23:10.369
but why would I pay
$9.99 for a medium pizza

23:10.371 --> 23:15.107
when I have a coupon for $7.99?

23:15.109 --> 23:20.213
No, I don't want to pay
$9.99 to not get the wings.

23:20.215 --> 23:24.718
I want to pay $7.99
with the coupon.

23:24.720 --> 23:27.689
And I want you to
keep the wings.

23:27.691 --> 23:30.324
I don't want them.

23:30.326 --> 23:33.194
If you think about
it, it's a win-win.

23:38.269 --> 23:41.404
Unbelievable.

23:41.406 --> 23:42.873
You know what?

23:42.875 --> 23:44.241
Bring the wings.

23:57.691 --> 23:59.892
Why doesn't she come out?

23:59.894 --> 24:02.095
She must be up by now.

24:02.097 --> 24:04.797
You say she stays up
all hours of the night.

24:04.799 --> 24:05.632
She's probably sleeping.

24:05.634 --> 24:07.901
Well, nobody sleeps this late.

24:07.903 --> 24:09.003
It's unnatural.

24:09.005 --> 24:10.404
It's 8:30.

24:10.406 --> 24:12.139
I know what time it is.

24:15.878 --> 24:20.382
Wrens are highly
adaptable, actually.

24:20.384 --> 24:23.120
Capable of living in
almost any environment...

24:23.122 --> 24:25.655
hedgerows, low-lying nests.

24:25.657 --> 24:31.527
Their scientific name
literally means cave dweller.

24:31.529 --> 24:34.998
Oh, I don't think so.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.634
What do you mean
you don't think so?

24:36.636 --> 24:38.402
It is so.

24:38.404 --> 24:41.140
She's not a bird.

24:41.142 --> 24:42.074
Bye, Walt.

24:42.076 --> 24:42.740
Oh.

24:42.742 --> 24:44.777
Mr. Lemke needs me.

24:44.779 --> 24:45.479
Jo Jo, leave him be.

24:48.684 --> 24:52.152
It's good for
him to have visitors.

24:52.154 --> 24:55.022
I invited half the neighborhood
to stop by and see him.

24:57.895 --> 25:01.597
Why do you have
to get involved?

25:01.599 --> 25:03.333
Oh, for Pete's sake.

25:41.644 --> 25:42.978
Hey.

25:42.980 --> 25:44.979
Did Chapman talk to you about
the call on Summit Street?

25:44.981 --> 25:45.681
What?

25:45.683 --> 25:46.682
Summit Street.

25:46.684 --> 25:48.383
The old man, the car.

25:48.385 --> 25:50.486
I already turned
in the report.

25:50.488 --> 25:52.122
But there's a
discrepancy, here.

25:52.124 --> 25:53.856
Oh, come on.

25:53.858 --> 25:55.258
Give me a break.

25:55.260 --> 25:58.362
You were out, so Chapman
talked to the ambulance driver.

25:58.364 --> 26:01.900
The driver says that when
he turned on to the street,

26:01.902 --> 26:03.035
he saw the whole
accident play out.

26:03.037 --> 26:04.569
And then we talked
to the neighbor.

26:04.571 --> 26:07.105
It's in the report.

26:07.107 --> 26:08.408
You're not hearing me.

26:08.410 --> 26:12.678
The driver says he actually
saw the old man get hit.

26:12.680 --> 26:13.712
What is he saying?

26:13.714 --> 26:15.915
That it was staged?

26:15.917 --> 26:17.583
Not staged.

26:17.585 --> 26:19.420
Just hadn't happened yet.

26:35.207 --> 26:38.776
What are you looking at?

26:38.778 --> 26:43.514
Why
should I be discouraged?

26:47.019 --> 26:52.792
Why should the shadows come?

26:52.794 --> 27:00.566
And why should my heart
be lonely and long

27:00.568 --> 27:02.936
for heaven and home?

27:06.509 --> 27:18.288
When Jesus is my portion,
a constant friend is he.

27:21.526 --> 27:32.370
His eye is on the sparrow,
and I know he's watching me.

27:35.442 --> 27:43.084
And I sing because I'm laughing.

27:43.086 --> 27:46.953
I sing because I'm free.

27:51.026 --> 27:57.498
His eye is on the sparrow.

27:57.500 --> 28:03.807
And I know he's watching me.

28:18.459 --> 28:19.725
Definitely a Virgo.

28:24.498 --> 28:25.766
Having company helps.

28:25.768 --> 28:27.401
But there are a
lot of alternatives

28:27.403 --> 28:31.671
for a guy like Walt. I
mean, I see a therapist.

28:32.708 --> 28:34.542
Donna Olson
goes to a shaman.

28:34.544 --> 28:35.709
Huh.

28:35.711 --> 28:37.211
I'm serious.

28:37.213 --> 28:40.015
You're so young.

28:40.017 --> 28:44.353
You know, the very
first time Walter

28:44.355 --> 28:47.288
took me on a fishing trip,
we stayed by the water

28:47.290 --> 28:49.026
for hours and hours.

28:49.028 --> 28:52.496
I... I thought it was disgusting.

28:52.498 --> 28:55.298
Why would anyone
want to do that?

28:57.202 --> 29:00.639
Since then, we've been on...

29:00.641 --> 29:03.441
I don't know how many...

29:03.443 --> 29:04.809
how many fishing trips.

29:10.618 --> 29:13.553
I've come two of them.

29:13.555 --> 29:13.953
Hm.

29:19.730 --> 29:25.433
He doesn't want
to fish anymore.

29:52.467 --> 29:53.298
Josh.

29:53.300 --> 29:56.569
Officer Moody!

29:56.571 --> 29:58.438
I... I don't think she's home.

30:01.509 --> 30:04.478
Oh.

30:19.131 --> 30:20.296
She's still not home.

30:20.298 --> 30:22.333
Don't you think that's strange?

30:22.335 --> 30:23.100
She's out.

30:23.102 --> 30:25.503
She's been gone all day.

30:25.505 --> 30:26.838
We were gone for a month.

30:26.840 --> 30:28.306
Wandering the
streets alone at night.

30:28.308 --> 30:30.174
She should have a car.

30:30.176 --> 30:31.343
Well, you don't have a car.

30:31.345 --> 30:33.746
You don't even have a license.

30:36.415 --> 30:38.418
I don't need a car.

30:38.420 --> 30:39.318
I've got you.

31:59.680 --> 32:01.913
Let's go
back inside, Arnie.

32:01.915 --> 32:03.749
Everything's fine.

32:03.751 --> 32:05.918
That's not what
it looks like from here.

32:09.025 --> 32:11.592
Have you lost your mind?

32:11.594 --> 32:13.860
The door was unlocked.

32:13.862 --> 32:16.662
What was I supposed to do?

32:16.664 --> 32:17.063
Hello.

32:23.173 --> 32:25.440
Is everything all right?

32:25.442 --> 32:26.241
Oh, yeah.

32:26.243 --> 32:27.677
Yeah, no, everything's fine.

32:27.679 --> 32:29.679
We just... we thought we
heard something, so...

32:29.681 --> 32:32.415
And we wanted to
invite you to dinner.

32:32.417 --> 32:34.251
Sure.

32:34.253 --> 32:35.420
Oh, great.

32:35.422 --> 32:37.055
Great.

32:37.057 --> 32:38.355
Just let me know when.

32:38.357 --> 32:39.857
Excellent.

32:39.859 --> 32:41.093
Honey, it's getting late.

32:41.095 --> 32:42.326
You want to go back inside?

32:42.328 --> 32:44.261
Yeah, I probably should.

32:44.263 --> 32:45.597
I think I have a headache.

32:45.599 --> 32:48.400
I'm sure you do.

32:48.402 --> 32:49.235
Good night.

32:55.843 --> 32:56.776
Don't you say it.

32:56.778 --> 32:58.011
I didn't say a word.

32:58.013 --> 33:00.180
I can see you in
there, trying to come up

33:00.182 --> 33:01.615
with something to
make me feel bad, when

33:01.617 --> 33:04.084
you know I already feel lousy.

33:04.086 --> 33:06.287
How is it possible that I...

33:06.289 --> 33:07.456
I'm the one who's wrong?

33:07.458 --> 33:09.991
You're the one who
interrupted me.

33:09.993 --> 33:12.461
I had a perfectly
reasonable fib, darling,

33:12.463 --> 33:14.163
and then you have
to come out with,

33:14.165 --> 33:17.132
oh, oh, we would love to
have you over for dinner.

33:17.134 --> 33:18.569
I think to know would be nice.

33:18.571 --> 33:19.902
That's not the point!

33:19.904 --> 33:21.304
That's not the point!

33:21.306 --> 33:23.807
The point is, you
can't go sneaking

33:23.809 --> 33:25.677
into other peoples' homes.

33:25.679 --> 33:27.411
That's the point.

33:27.413 --> 33:29.547
You always
have to harp on me.

33:29.549 --> 33:30.882
Couldn't you just let it go?

33:30.884 --> 33:31.950
You want me to let it go?

33:31.952 --> 33:32.718
Yes.

33:32.720 --> 33:34.385
Just forget about it?

33:34.387 --> 33:34.888
Yes.

33:34.890 --> 33:37.390
Oh, OK.

33:37.392 --> 33:37.790
Fine.

33:49.373 --> 33:53.842
All right Where are you going?

34:24.847 --> 34:25.246
OK.

34:48.708 --> 34:50.340
Come on, Jo Jo.

34:50.342 --> 34:52.208
Let's get you to bed, huh?

34:52.210 --> 34:53.143
Come on.

34:53.146 --> 34:54.545
Come on.

34:54.547 --> 34:56.481
Come on.

34:56.483 --> 34:57.983
Oh, honey.

34:57.985 --> 34:58.851
She's gone.

35:04.925 --> 35:05.324
Come on.

35:08.797 --> 35:09.796
There we go.

35:09.798 --> 35:10.796
Upsie.

35:10.798 --> 35:11.699
Upsie daisie.

35:28.286 --> 35:28.851
Oh!

35:28.853 --> 35:31.488
I'm... I'm sorry.

35:31.490 --> 35:34.657
I... sorry.

35:34.659 --> 35:37.360
Are you OK?

35:37.362 --> 35:40.664
I didn't, like, break your arm?

35:40.666 --> 35:44.536
You're not gonna sue me?

35:44.538 --> 35:45.905
I'm very sorry.

35:50.644 --> 35:51.309
No.

35:51.311 --> 35:54.146
Oh, don't be sorry.

35:54.148 --> 35:56.016
Like, be not sorry.

35:59.789 --> 36:01.423
What is magic?

36:01.425 --> 36:03.157
Science we
don't understand yet?

36:03.159 --> 36:05.427
The invisible
made visible for a moment.

36:05.429 --> 36:06.827
Something
that invokes a very

36:06.829 --> 36:08.695
personal and special feeling.

36:08.697 --> 36:10.766
Take music, for example.

36:10.768 --> 36:15.604
It's like when Dizzie Gillespie
plays the horn and his cheeks

36:15.606 --> 36:17.507
get real big.

36:17.509 --> 36:21.979
Or like when Stevie
Wonder plays the piano,

36:21.981 --> 36:23.014
and he does like this.

36:25.251 --> 36:30.123
Or Michael Jackson, and
he goes, hee, hee, hee!

36:31.090 --> 36:32.324
And he does the moonwalk.

36:35.097 --> 36:37.530
You have to go into it
knowing that you're not

36:37.532 --> 36:40.266
going to know, and just listen.

36:40.268 --> 36:41.300
Here we go.

36:41.302 --> 36:42.903
Oh, boy, I'm
talking red meat.

36:42.905 --> 36:44.104
Arnie, help her.

36:44.106 --> 36:45.940
- Don't just help yourself.
- What?

36:45.942 --> 36:47.273
I'm... I'm not eating.

36:47.275 --> 36:48.776
I'm just preparing.

36:48.778 --> 36:50.679
Wren, here, please.

36:50.681 --> 36:51.546
Allow me.

36:51.548 --> 36:53.215
Thank you.

36:53.217 --> 36:55.617
So where were you
before you came here?

36:55.619 --> 36:58.988
Kansas, just outside
of Kansas City, actually.

36:58.990 --> 36:59.956
Kansas City.

36:59.958 --> 37:02.358
That's quite a move.

37:02.360 --> 37:03.459
Mm-hm.

37:03.461 --> 37:06.097
There's, um, a
prison there, right?

37:06.099 --> 37:07.164
I... I don't know.

37:07.166 --> 37:08.266
No, there is.

37:08.268 --> 37:10.601
Um, the mighty Fort Leavenworth.

37:10.603 --> 37:13.371
Phew, it's a huge complex.

37:13.373 --> 37:14.505
Massive.

37:14.507 --> 37:16.608
Fort Leavenworth.

37:16.610 --> 37:19.478
How interesting.

37:19.480 --> 37:21.581
Are you sure you don't know it?

37:21.583 --> 37:22.882
Sounds familiar.

37:22.884 --> 37:24.985
You never had any
direct affiliation?

37:24.987 --> 37:28.956
No contact with
any of the felons?

37:28.958 --> 37:30.324
Um...

37:30.326 --> 37:33.896
Well, you never did any,
say, writing to the prisoners?

37:33.898 --> 37:35.396
No, I...

37:35.398 --> 37:36.498
I never did that.

37:36.500 --> 37:37.298
Good grief.

37:37.300 --> 37:39.701
Jo Jo, she's not a convict.

37:44.143 --> 37:46.610
You're not... you're
not a convict?

37:46.612 --> 37:49.079
Oh, shoot, maybe she is.

38:31.996 --> 38:33.396
OK.

38:33.398 --> 38:33.797
OK.

38:37.269 --> 38:38.269
Oh, oh.

38:38.271 --> 38:39.737
Oh, oh, oh.

38:39.739 --> 38:41.740
Almost there.

38:41.742 --> 38:43.109
Let's see here.

38:50.652 --> 38:51.050
Bravo.

38:58.594 --> 39:00.193
OK.

39:00.195 --> 39:01.796
Back we go.

39:01.798 --> 39:04.298
Back we go.

39:04.300 --> 39:05.800
This car is huge.

39:05.802 --> 39:08.269
Whoo!

39:08.271 --> 39:09.271
Oh.

39:09.273 --> 39:09.673
Oh.

39:16.748 --> 39:18.249
OK.

39:18.251 --> 39:19.751
All right.

39:19.753 --> 39:21.719
Oh, oh, oh.

39:21.721 --> 39:24.121
This is just like
riding a bicycle.

39:27.726 --> 39:28.693
Little too much.

39:28.695 --> 39:30.963
Little too much.
Oh.

39:30.965 --> 39:34.101
So sensitive.

39:34.103 --> 39:36.103
Slowly now.

39:37.105 --> 39:38.570
What's that dinging?

39:38.572 --> 39:39.472
What is the dinging?

39:48.085 --> 39:49.550
OK.

39:49.552 --> 39:51.453
Where are you, my little walker?

40:01.833 --> 40:02.232
Aha.

40:05.804 --> 40:07.773
You're doing pretty
good at this.

40:11.210 --> 40:13.179
Oh, come on.

40:25.561 --> 40:30.231
You don't have to make
a big deal out of this.

40:30.233 --> 40:34.469
Green.

40:50.389 --> 40:53.191
Is Jo Ann around?

40:53.193 --> 40:55.193
Yep.

40:55.195 --> 40:58.396
She's been around
for a very long time.

41:01.536 --> 41:02.501
She's downstairs.

41:02.503 --> 41:03.036
Go ahead.

41:03.038 --> 41:03.869
Thank you.

41:16.686 --> 41:19.121
Jo Ann?

41:19.123 --> 41:19.988
Jo Ann?

41:19.990 --> 41:20.856
Ah!

41:20.858 --> 41:21.724
Oh, oh.

41:21.726 --> 41:24.059
Oh.

41:24.061 --> 41:26.095
You almost gave
me a heart attack.

41:26.097 --> 41:27.030
I'm sorry.

41:27.032 --> 41:28.130
Arnie told me you
were down here.

41:28.132 --> 41:29.300
Oh, that's nice.

41:29.302 --> 41:30.501
Let me make some tea.

41:30.503 --> 41:31.702
Actually, I can't stay.

41:31.704 --> 41:36.574
I just... I wanted to talk
to you about yesterday.

41:36.576 --> 41:38.541
You were following me.

41:38.543 --> 41:39.577
Hm?

41:39.579 --> 41:41.613
You were driving
a car... your car.

41:41.615 --> 41:42.581
My car?

41:42.583 --> 41:44.950
No, I don't even have a license.

41:44.952 --> 41:47.253
A policeman pulled you over.

41:47.255 --> 41:49.389
You ran over the shrubbery.

41:49.391 --> 41:50.222
Oh.

41:50.224 --> 41:52.193
Gee, I hardly remember that.

41:52.195 --> 41:53.293
It's OK.

41:53.295 --> 41:56.162
But I wanted to ask
you not to do that.

41:56.164 --> 41:59.467
Well, look, I'm not
crazy or anything.

41:59.469 --> 42:02.202
A little high-strung,
maybe, but...

42:02.204 --> 42:06.543
oh gosh, how do I say it?

42:06.545 --> 42:08.411
You get a lot of mail.

42:24.798 --> 42:26.465
You looking for Wren?

42:26.467 --> 42:27.766
Yeah, Wren Miller.

42:27.768 --> 42:29.534
Person who lives here.

42:29.536 --> 42:31.405
She in... she in trouble?

42:31.407 --> 42:32.238
No, no.

42:32.240 --> 42:34.842
No, she's not in any trouble.

42:34.844 --> 42:36.677
You know where she is?

42:36.679 --> 42:37.644
Yeah.

42:37.646 --> 42:39.546
She's with my wife.

42:39.548 --> 42:42.883
We older women do
not take to eccentricities,

42:42.885 --> 42:46.153
unless they're our
own or our husbands'.

42:46.155 --> 42:48.824
I'll flush 'em out...
flush 'em out for you.

42:51.996 --> 42:52.729
Come on.

42:52.731 --> 42:55.264
I understand.

42:55.266 --> 42:58.668
So what on God's green
earth are you doing up there?

42:58.670 --> 42:59.670
Jo Jo!

42:59.672 --> 43:02.106
There's a police
officer up here.

43:02.108 --> 43:05.043
He needs to see your
friend for a minute.

43:05.045 --> 43:07.244
Can you send her up?

43:07.246 --> 43:08.713
Please don't let
him know I'm here.

43:08.715 --> 43:09.414
Oh.

43:09.416 --> 43:10.483
Honey!

43:10.485 --> 43:11.416
Please.

43:11.418 --> 43:12.351
Why?

43:12.353 --> 43:13.251
What's wrong?

43:13.253 --> 43:14.554
- Jo Jo!
- Please.

43:19.827 --> 43:21.595
Honey, no one's here.

43:21.597 --> 43:22.896
It's just me!

43:22.898 --> 43:26.101
What... what about Wren?

43:26.103 --> 43:29.070
Dear, Wren.

43:29.072 --> 43:30.838
From next door.

43:30.840 --> 43:31.673
No.

43:31.675 --> 43:32.275
No, hon.

43:32.277 --> 43:34.776
She's gone.

43:34.778 --> 43:37.581
She can't hear me.

43:37.583 --> 43:40.751
You just have to come down here.

43:40.753 --> 43:41.717
Yeah.

43:41.719 --> 43:42.653
No, come on.

43:42.655 --> 43:43.487
Oh, OK.

43:50.929 --> 43:52.163
Honey, I'm naked!

43:55.101 --> 43:56.367
Honey?

43:56.369 --> 43:57.269
I mean it, Arnie.

43:57.271 --> 44:00.407
I'm naked, completely naked.

44:00.409 --> 44:02.909
Don't you dare come down
here, and don't you dare

44:02.911 --> 44:05.646
bring some other man down here.

44:05.648 --> 44:07.780
What... what about Wren?

44:07.782 --> 44:09.751
Honey, he's looking for Wren.

44:09.753 --> 44:12.521
Well, she's gone.

44:12.523 --> 44:15.791
I have no idea where she is.

44:15.793 --> 44:17.126
It's OK.

44:17.128 --> 44:22.932
It's... she can call me later.

44:22.934 --> 44:24.768
You can't
make this stuff up.

44:32.246 --> 44:37.615
I am 74 years
old, and not once...

44:37.617 --> 44:41.552
not once... have I had a
police officer enter my home.

44:41.554 --> 44:43.690
Honey, everything's fine.

44:43.692 --> 44:44.391
No, no.

44:44.393 --> 44:46.126
Everything's not fine.

44:46.128 --> 44:48.496
Everything is far from fine.

44:48.498 --> 44:51.898
Driving without a license,
hiding from the police.

44:51.900 --> 44:55.537
Breaking and entering,
conspiring with a...

44:55.539 --> 45:00.108
an ex-con, prisoner, pen
pal, or who knows what.

45:00.110 --> 45:01.476
Everything's not fine.

45:01.478 --> 45:03.177
I never meant to
cause any trouble.

45:03.179 --> 45:04.179
Oh, what did you mean to do?

45:04.181 --> 45:05.113
Honey.

45:05.115 --> 45:06.282
No, I'm just
asking a question.

45:06.284 --> 45:07.083
No, he's... he's right.

45:07.085 --> 45:08.550
You're right.

45:08.552 --> 45:11.923
I... I put you in a
compromising position.

45:11.925 --> 45:14.490
I don't care for people
who have something to hide.

45:14.492 --> 45:15.691
I understand.

45:15.693 --> 45:18.530
My wife and I, we have
been... well, I have been...

45:18.532 --> 45:21.065
a law-abiding
citizen all my life.

45:21.067 --> 45:22.401
Arnie.

45:22.403 --> 45:25.670
So have I. And I know
you might not believe that,

45:25.672 --> 45:26.572
but it's true.

45:31.512 --> 45:33.414
How much do you
know about wrens?

45:33.416 --> 45:36.115
Oh, honey, I don't think
she wants to talk about birds.

45:36.117 --> 45:39.619
No, I think she'll
find this interesting.

45:39.621 --> 45:42.757
Legend has it that
back in the day,

45:42.759 --> 45:45.728
the birds decided to
make whichever bird

45:45.730 --> 45:48.530
flew the highest their king.

45:48.532 --> 45:50.766
So do you know
what the wren did?

45:50.768 --> 45:56.173
The wren hid inside the
feathers of a great eagle.

45:56.175 --> 46:00.344
It hitched a ride
to a great height,

46:00.346 --> 46:03.414
only to emerge and
outfly the eagle

46:03.416 --> 46:06.784
after the eagle had tired.

46:06.786 --> 46:11.557
As a punishment, the wren is now
forced to live a life of shame

46:11.559 --> 46:16.563
in almost total concealment.

46:16.565 --> 46:17.431
Excuse me.

46:21.003 --> 46:22.769
What's wrong with you?

46:25.641 --> 46:27.041
Oh.

46:27.043 --> 46:32.514
What's... what's wrong with me?

46:59.614 --> 47:00.947
Jo.

47:00.949 --> 47:01.849
Don't you touch me.

47:01.851 --> 47:03.050
I'm mad at you.

47:03.052 --> 47:03.684
Look.

47:03.686 --> 47:05.485
No, you look.

47:05.487 --> 47:08.521
How long has it been since we
had a young girl in our lives?

47:08.523 --> 47:09.856
Oh, come on.

47:09.858 --> 47:13.061
No, it's OK for you because
you never do anything wrong.

47:13.063 --> 47:16.664
I'm the one who always
ruins everything.

47:16.666 --> 47:18.300
I want her to like me.

47:18.302 --> 47:23.105
I need to feel like I can
do it right this time.

47:33.686 --> 47:40.592
'Cause when it's
raining, I've no regrets.

47:40.594 --> 47:46.566
Because it isn't
raining rain, you know.

47:46.568 --> 47:48.469
It's raining violets.

47:56.045 --> 48:01.617
And when you see the
clouds up on the hills,

48:01.619 --> 48:07.023
you're gonna see
crowds of daffodils.

48:11.597 --> 48:15.099
I'm sorry.

48:15.101 --> 48:16.000
Me, too.

48:21.074 --> 48:29.081
Sunflower, yellow and gold.

48:29.083 --> 48:39.059
I saw her plant it
beside the road.

48:39.061 --> 48:44.532
I can't take her.

48:44.534 --> 48:47.036
No.

48:47.038 --> 48:54.911
'Cause she's so pretty
beside the road.

49:13.034 --> 49:14.034
Good morning.

49:14.036 --> 49:15.970
Good morning.

49:15.972 --> 49:16.470
How...

49:16.472 --> 49:16.871
Come in.

49:24.280 --> 49:24.679
Huh.

49:28.251 --> 49:29.885
Do you know about the bluejay?

49:32.757 --> 49:39.162
Well, the bluejay is
a very arrogant bird.

49:39.164 --> 49:43.900
Very bratty and, uh, mean.

49:43.902 --> 49:44.869
They intimidate.

49:44.871 --> 49:46.104
They're bullies.

49:46.106 --> 49:48.574
They can get way out of control.

49:48.576 --> 49:51.543
But they do it to
protect their own.

49:51.545 --> 49:54.913
They... they don't
mean it personal.

49:59.989 --> 50:02.456
Yeah?

50:02.458 --> 50:04.925
Yeah.

50:10.467 --> 50:11.967
I liked having them.

50:11.969 --> 50:14.871
I didn't know my lemonade stand
would be such an attraction.

50:27.251 --> 50:27.818
Oh!

50:27.820 --> 50:29.318
Hey!

50:29.320 --> 50:30.287
I, uh...

50:30.289 --> 50:31.755
I was just going
down to the Lemkes.

50:31.757 --> 50:32.758
Oh?

50:32.760 --> 50:34.126
She's not home.

50:38.632 --> 50:39.998
They just fell out.

50:51.880 --> 50:53.749
Mr. Bayberry?

50:53.751 --> 50:55.217
Officer.

50:55.219 --> 50:57.052
You're a bird man.

50:57.054 --> 50:58.619
Ornithologist.

50:58.621 --> 51:02.258
Just got back from an
expedition in Kenya.

51:02.260 --> 51:03.291
What brings you here?

51:03.293 --> 51:04.994
My wife isn't, um...

51:04.996 --> 51:06.362
Oh, no.

51:06.364 --> 51:07.498
Good.

51:07.500 --> 51:11.068
I'm sure that was just,
uh, one of those things.

51:11.070 --> 51:12.070
One can only hope.

51:14.806 --> 51:15.941
No.

51:15.943 --> 51:16.941
I can't.

51:16.943 --> 51:19.344
It's only you and
me in the garage.

51:19.346 --> 51:20.780
Who's gonna know?

51:20.782 --> 51:21.181
OK.

51:26.121 --> 51:28.289
Her name isn't
even on the envelope.

51:28.291 --> 51:29.190
Just the address.

51:29.192 --> 51:29.722
OK.

51:29.724 --> 51:30.791
What is it?

51:30.793 --> 51:31.825
I don't know.

51:31.827 --> 51:33.894
It doesn't start or
stop on this page.

51:33.896 --> 51:35.662
It's in the middle of something.

51:35.664 --> 51:36.530
Read it.

51:36.532 --> 51:37.932
OK.

51:37.934 --> 51:42.137
"I was hoping so much that John
would be here when I returned,

51:42.139 --> 51:46.141
but the only person who
was there was Evelyn.

51:46.143 --> 51:48.711
I was almost shaking,
I was so nervous.

51:48.713 --> 51:51.081
"You know how you play things
over and over in your head

51:51.083 --> 51:53.651
when something doesn't
happen the way you expect?

51:53.653 --> 51:56.320
It's like you're left
wandering in a dream.

51:56.322 --> 51:58.822
Like the other day,
when I was by myself,

51:58.824 --> 52:00.925
doing the simplest of things...

52:00.927 --> 52:03.429
a load of laundry
by the screen door.

52:03.431 --> 52:04.630
And there it was...

52:04.632 --> 52:06.532
his shirt.

52:06.534 --> 52:08.367
And then I just stopped.

52:08.369 --> 52:12.539
I put it down right where it
was and just left the house

52:12.541 --> 52:15.943
with everything scattered."

52:15.945 --> 52:18.711
That's it?

52:18.713 --> 52:19.514
It ends there?

52:22.652 --> 52:24.452
One more?

52:24.454 --> 52:27.222
I was wondering if
you or someone you know

52:27.224 --> 52:31.795
could tell me what
kind of bird this is.

52:31.797 --> 52:32.929
Where'd you find this?

52:32.931 --> 52:35.065
Flew against my window.

52:35.067 --> 52:35.932
I could hear it flapping.

52:35.934 --> 52:38.001
It was stuck against the screen.

52:38.003 --> 52:41.237
Been staring at it ever since
for no particular reason.

52:41.239 --> 52:42.639
Then I remembered
seeing all those bird

52:42.641 --> 52:43.407
pictures at your house.

52:43.409 --> 52:45.342
I thought I'd ask, uh...

52:45.344 --> 52:46.912
This is my photograph!

52:46.914 --> 52:48.345
My picture!

52:48.347 --> 52:49.315
Yours?

52:49.317 --> 52:50.950
I lost it.

52:50.952 --> 52:52.351
This is a pygmy falcon.

52:52.353 --> 52:54.320
A pygmy falcon?

52:54.322 --> 52:55.889
I was in my
front yard going over

52:55.891 --> 53:01.695
photos from my trip when I first
discovered this among the rest.

53:01.697 --> 53:03.863
I don't remember
taking this picture,

53:03.865 --> 53:08.369
and a bird man like me is paid
to remember that sort of stuff.

53:08.371 --> 53:11.072
I might have thought I was crazy
if it hadn't been for Wren.

53:11.074 --> 53:11.874
Your neighbor.

53:11.876 --> 53:13.307
Mm.

53:13.309 --> 53:16.912
Yeah, she was there when I
saw this for the first time.

53:16.914 --> 53:19.316
She knew what it was.

53:19.318 --> 53:21.818
Immediately, which is rare.

53:21.820 --> 53:25.322
She knew exactly what it was.

53:25.324 --> 53:30.128
Do you mind telling
me what you know?

53:30.130 --> 53:32.496
About pygmy falcons?

53:32.498 --> 53:33.798
About wrens.

53:37.103 --> 53:39.472
Oh.

53:39.474 --> 53:43.476
What my wife wouldn't
give to be here now.

53:43.478 --> 53:46.479
"It's not difficult
to say your wife has passed.

53:46.481 --> 53:48.514
The information flows freely.

53:48.516 --> 53:50.818
You can be very
third-person about it,

53:50.820 --> 53:52.987
almost pretend as if it
has happened to someone

53:52.989 --> 53:55.391
you've never met.

53:55.393 --> 53:58.126
What's hard are the...

53:58.128 --> 54:02.599
what's hard are the questions,
the inevitable questions

54:02.601 --> 54:04.800
that come up later.

54:04.802 --> 54:08.305
That's what trips you up."

54:08.307 --> 54:08.706
Wow.

54:15.882 --> 54:17.983
"Have
you watched something dead?

54:17.985 --> 54:19.950
Have you stared it down?

54:19.952 --> 54:23.021
Have you held it in your hands?

54:23.023 --> 54:24.824
Do you know what it looks like?

54:24.826 --> 54:26.592
I do.

54:26.594 --> 54:27.894
Relief."

54:27.896 --> 54:29.929
"And I knew
then it was over for us."

54:29.931 --> 54:34.202
"I actually knew the night
before, when she didn't call..."

54:34.204 --> 54:35.436
"...when she had gone

54:35.438 --> 54:37.905
all weekend with hardly a word.

54:37.907 --> 54:39.641
She always called."

54:39.643 --> 54:42.711
"Without exception."

54:42.713 --> 54:43.979
"So
I went to the bar

54:43.981 --> 54:46.950
where we first me and
listened to jazz like we

54:46.952 --> 54:48.284
used to in the beginning.

54:48.286 --> 54:49.719
Except this time..."

54:49.721 --> 54:52.521
"...I didn't feel inspired.

54:52.523 --> 54:54.825
I fear I have no idea who I am."

54:54.827 --> 54:56.728
I kissed
my grandfather on the cheek

54:56.730 --> 55:00.063
and told him to feel better,
even though I knew it would be

55:00.065 --> 55:01.097
the last time I would ever..."

55:01.099 --> 55:02.200
"I decided

55:02.202 --> 55:04.202
to tell the truth for a change.

55:04.204 --> 55:06.472
Maybe I'm just tired of
trying to be someone else."

55:06.474 --> 55:07.907
"I lifted a hand

55:07.909 --> 55:09.775
to anyone behind bars here.

55:09.777 --> 55:12.010
Almost five years now.

55:12.012 --> 55:13.546
But I feel it coming up."

55:26.963 --> 55:28.496
"They disappeared.

55:28.498 --> 55:30.199
My sister said they
did not come back."

55:30.201 --> 55:31.700
"My mama told me I'd

55:31.702 --> 55:33.503
be pretty when I gold older.

55:33.505 --> 55:37.106
He says he has a friend
who wants to love me, too."

55:56.532 --> 55:58.231
"Listening
to children laughing.

55:58.233 --> 56:00.467
I should be happy hearing
these soft, sweet sounds,

56:00.469 --> 56:03.338
but all I can think about
is how large I've become,

56:03.340 --> 56:06.807
how much I've let myself go.

56:06.809 --> 56:08.177
I'm so fat."

56:08.179 --> 56:09.711
"I'm so unloved.

56:09.713 --> 56:11.313
I have no baby.

56:11.315 --> 56:13.983
These words play
over in my head.

56:13.985 --> 56:16.385
I can hear those
kids playing even

56:16.387 --> 56:19.190
when my ears are underwater.

56:19.192 --> 56:22.325
It's true.

56:22.327 --> 56:25.063
You can hear joy through waves."

56:28.168 --> 56:30.702
Oh god, that's sad.

56:30.704 --> 56:31.536
Don't worry.

56:31.538 --> 56:33.271
I'll put them in a safe place.

56:33.273 --> 56:36.309
Yeah, but what...
what if she finds out?

56:36.311 --> 56:38.811
Something is happening here.

56:38.813 --> 56:41.414
It... it is beyond us.

56:41.416 --> 56:43.617
I mean, I don't
even know here,

56:43.619 --> 56:47.789
and I just can't get
her off of my mind.

56:47.791 --> 56:50.192
Maybe you should
write her a letter.

57:57.237 --> 57:59.104
Hi.

57:59.106 --> 58:01.740
I... I used to play
when I was young.

58:01.742 --> 58:02.442
Nice to see you.

58:05.079 --> 58:06.579
Nice to see you.

58:06.581 --> 58:08.581
You wanna play?

58:08.583 --> 58:09.481
Come on.

58:13.054 --> 58:14.054
Come on.

58:14.056 --> 58:15.456
It's gonna be beautiful.

58:18.561 --> 58:18.960
Thanks.

58:34.012 --> 58:34.411
Yes.

58:38.018 --> 58:40.517
That's so good.

01:00:33.282 --> 01:00:35.115
Where's Arnold?

01:00:35.117 --> 01:00:36.217
He'll be here.

01:00:36.219 --> 01:00:37.952
He's just getting a
refill for the kids.

01:00:53.172 --> 01:00:55.039
Everything all right?

01:01:01.882 --> 01:01:03.682
Oh, Jo.

01:01:03.684 --> 01:01:04.951
Get my camera.

01:01:09.490 --> 01:01:11.224
Look at him.

01:01:11.226 --> 01:01:12.226
Uh-oh.

01:01:12.228 --> 01:01:13.695
He's spilling
the lemonade.

01:01:13.697 --> 01:01:15.095
Jo Jo, get my camera.

01:01:15.097 --> 01:01:15.931
Jo Jo.

01:01:19.335 --> 01:01:20.369
Shh.

01:01:20.371 --> 01:01:21.202
Not a good move.

01:01:21.204 --> 01:01:22.606
I couldn't do that.

01:01:22.608 --> 01:01:23.941
He might not get up.

01:01:27.844 --> 01:01:28.243
Shh.

01:01:31.916 --> 01:01:32.983
Oh my god.

01:01:32.985 --> 01:01:35.653
Easy now.

01:01:35.655 --> 01:01:36.720
Easy, easy.

01:01:36.722 --> 01:01:37.588
Oh!

01:01:37.590 --> 01:01:38.454
Whoops!

01:01:38.456 --> 01:01:39.657
Arnie!

01:01:39.659 --> 01:01:40.391
A what?

01:01:40.393 --> 01:01:43.195
A Bali starling.

01:01:43.197 --> 01:01:46.432
Just sitting there in
my crab apple tree.

01:01:46.434 --> 01:01:50.104
Arnie, one of the most
important and obvious

01:01:50.106 --> 01:01:53.005
characteristics in
identifying a Bali starling

01:01:53.007 --> 01:01:57.177
is, not surprisingly, that it
is typically found in Bali.

01:01:57.179 --> 01:01:57.945
Oh, I know.

01:01:59.016 --> 01:02:00.180
And, more
specifically, in three

01:02:00.182 --> 01:02:03.184
separate bird parks in Bali.

01:02:03.186 --> 01:02:08.757
You do realize that there are
barely over 100 in existence?

01:02:08.759 --> 01:02:10.626
And if you count the
ones in captivity

01:02:10.628 --> 01:02:13.429
or the ones poached for the
cage bird trade, even then...

01:02:13.431 --> 01:02:15.898
No, no, no.

01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:18.001
This was not a caged bird.

01:02:18.003 --> 01:02:19.403
It's not possible.

01:02:19.405 --> 01:02:22.373
It was a Bali starling.

01:02:22.375 --> 01:02:24.275
It was the most
astonishing sighting I

01:02:24.277 --> 01:02:26.512
have ever had in my life ever.

01:02:26.514 --> 01:02:30.483
It's what we wait our
whole lives for is...

01:02:30.485 --> 01:02:31.416
it was a miracle.

01:02:31.418 --> 01:02:35.889
Like
the pygmy falcon.

01:02:35.891 --> 01:02:37.224
Dammit.

01:02:37.226 --> 01:02:40.061
Stan, I am not crazy.

01:02:40.063 --> 01:02:41.327
I know what I saw.

01:02:41.329 --> 01:02:44.097
I saw a Bali starling,
stark white with the blue

01:02:44.099 --> 01:02:45.467
around the eyes.

01:02:45.469 --> 01:02:47.034
And the tuft.

01:02:47.036 --> 01:02:49.037
There's nothing else like it.

01:02:49.039 --> 01:02:50.238
Nothing.

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:51.641
I saw it.

01:02:51.643 --> 01:02:53.409
I had it in my sights.

01:02:53.411 --> 01:02:57.780
It was 10 feet away from
me for a full minute.

01:02:57.782 --> 01:03:02.920
I had a very, very
good look at it.

01:03:05.791 --> 01:03:07.692
I know what I saw.

01:03:29.954 --> 01:03:33.923
Come to the neighborhood
if you want to see her.

01:03:33.925 --> 01:03:37.092
Sit with us on the lawn.

01:03:37.094 --> 01:03:41.664
There's something quite
special about her.

01:03:41.666 --> 01:03:46.436
Soft-spoken, graceful, elegant.

01:03:46.438 --> 01:03:49.941
She seems tall, even
though she's not.

01:03:52.778 --> 01:03:56.115
Every day she walks.

01:03:56.117 --> 01:04:00.519
It seems simple enough, but
with her it's different.

01:04:00.521 --> 01:04:06.059
It's purposeful, as though
she's walking on air.

01:04:06.061 --> 01:04:07.528
She's so quiet.

01:04:07.530 --> 01:04:11.099
She just appears.

01:04:11.101 --> 01:04:16.104
And before you know
it, she's gone.

01:04:16.106 --> 01:04:18.039
Dispatch
to Officer Burkheart.

01:04:18.041 --> 01:04:21.976
Come in, Officer Burkheart.

01:04:29.853 --> 01:04:31.221
What are you looking at?

01:04:33.893 --> 01:04:38.262
I'm waiting for
the second coming.

01:04:51.246 --> 01:04:57.217
Well, the moon is broken,
and the sky is cracked.

01:04:57.219 --> 01:05:01.688
Come on up to the house.

01:05:01.690 --> 01:05:07.829
The only things that you can
see is all that you lack.

01:05:07.831 --> 01:05:10.666
Well, come on up to the house.

01:05:13.739 --> 01:05:18.641
All your crying
don't do no good.

01:05:18.643 --> 01:05:23.046
Come on up to the house.

01:05:23.048 --> 01:05:26.318
Well, come down off the cross.

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:28.820
We can use the wood.

01:05:28.822 --> 01:05:32.793
You gotta come on
up to the house.

01:05:32.795 --> 01:05:33.193
Yeah.

01:05:55.152 --> 01:06:01.624
You gotta come on
up to the house.

01:06:01.626 --> 01:06:05.595
Come on up to the house.

01:06:05.597 --> 01:06:08.566
The world is not my home.

01:06:08.568 --> 01:06:10.568
I'm just a-passin' through.

01:06:10.570 --> 01:06:14.940
You've got to come
on up to the house.

01:06:20.983 --> 01:06:21.383
Oh.

01:06:27.356 --> 01:06:30.224
I came to get
the letters back.

01:06:55.255 --> 01:06:57.722
They're in there.

01:06:57.724 --> 01:06:58.123
Oh.

01:07:07.168 --> 01:07:07.601
Thank you.

01:07:10.673 --> 01:07:11.938
Shh.

01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:12.507
Shh.

01:07:12.509 --> 01:07:14.409
It's OK, baby.

01:07:14.411 --> 01:07:16.411
It's just you and me.

01:07:16.413 --> 01:07:16.813
Huh?

01:07:21.353 --> 01:07:23.353
Oh, god, you little beauty.

01:07:23.355 --> 01:07:24.722
What are you doing here?

01:07:28.293 --> 01:07:28.692
Ooh.

01:07:34.766 --> 01:07:35.266
Are you posing?

01:07:37.871 --> 01:07:39.704
I'm sorry about
your granddaughter.

01:07:39.706 --> 01:07:41.440
What?

01:07:41.442 --> 01:07:42.273
Allison.

01:07:42.275 --> 01:07:44.945
I know how much you miss her.

01:07:44.947 --> 01:07:47.447
How do you know that?

01:07:47.449 --> 01:07:51.918
Wren, how do you
know about Allison?

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:52.819
I just do.

01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:33.000
Jo Jo!

01:08:33.002 --> 01:08:33.399
Whoo!

01:08:54.926 --> 01:08:56.792
I did it.

01:08:56.795 --> 01:08:58.495
I can't believe it, but...

01:08:58.497 --> 01:09:04.102
but I actually
wrote her a letter.

01:09:04.104 --> 01:09:06.638
She knows.

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:08.473
What can you tell
us about the bird you saw?

01:09:08.475 --> 01:09:11.142
Uh, it's a Bali starling.

01:09:11.144 --> 01:09:12.745
It's very rare.

01:09:12.747 --> 01:09:17.716
There are only 100
of them in existence.

01:09:17.719 --> 01:09:19.652
Oh, come on.

01:09:19.654 --> 01:09:22.121
Don't give me a hard time.

01:09:22.122 --> 01:09:23.590
Look at these shots.

01:09:23.591 --> 01:09:24.591
- Look at that.
- Wow!

01:09:24.594 --> 01:09:25.158
I know.

01:09:25.161 --> 01:09:25.725
Look at this.

01:09:25.728 --> 01:09:26.727
You're kidding.

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:31.800
She just came by and got them.

01:09:31.801 --> 01:09:34.970
She knew I'd taken them,
knew where I'd hidden them.

01:09:34.971 --> 01:09:37.040
But it was more than that.

01:09:37.042 --> 01:09:39.443
She knows about me.

01:09:39.444 --> 01:09:42.745
And she knows what happened.

01:09:42.747 --> 01:09:44.281
What happened?

01:09:44.283 --> 01:09:45.750
Because
this is unheard of.

01:09:45.752 --> 01:09:47.917
I mean, this is
quite extraordinary.

01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:49.786
Well, I think
it's fantastic.

01:09:49.787 --> 01:09:52.991
I had no idea that so many of
my constituents were into birds,

01:09:52.993 --> 01:09:55.760
and I will be directing my
office to do everything we can

01:09:55.762 --> 01:09:57.430
do to get the bird returned.

01:09:57.432 --> 01:09:59.832
I mean, obviously, we're
interested in this bird.

01:10:40.748 --> 01:10:43.183
We had a son, Marty.

01:10:43.185 --> 01:10:44.851
Did you know that?

01:10:44.853 --> 01:10:48.321
After high school he
sort of went his own way.

01:10:48.323 --> 01:10:50.223
Just because we had some
problems getting along,

01:10:50.225 --> 01:10:51.491
that's all.

01:10:51.493 --> 01:10:54.327
We lost track of him.

01:10:54.329 --> 01:10:56.865
Then out of the blue
he calls and told us

01:10:56.867 --> 01:10:59.601
he was getting married
to a girl named Danielle.

01:10:59.603 --> 01:11:02.537
She made him get back
in touch with us.

01:11:02.539 --> 01:11:05.775
And a couple of years after
that, they had a little girl.

01:11:05.777 --> 01:11:08.011
A beautiful little
girl named Allison.

01:11:11.315 --> 01:11:13.116
Hm.

01:11:13.118 --> 01:11:15.052
There was
a bad car accident,

01:11:15.054 --> 01:11:17.321
and Marty didn't make it.

01:11:17.323 --> 01:11:18.156
He passed away.

01:11:23.029 --> 01:11:26.264
But we still saw Danielle
and Allison after that.

01:11:26.266 --> 01:11:29.768
And I'd watch Allison sometimes
when Danielle was at work.

01:11:29.770 --> 01:11:33.807
Marty used to tinker with
an old muscle car, a GTO

01:11:33.809 --> 01:11:36.244
that he kept in our garage.

01:11:36.246 --> 01:11:39.412
So sometimes I would take
Allie out to the car,

01:11:39.414 --> 01:11:43.050
and we'd pretend like we
were driving to the stores

01:11:43.052 --> 01:11:49.159
or driving to visit papa,
or just going to the movies.

01:11:49.161 --> 01:11:54.331
It was a way to keep
Marty alive in our minds.

01:11:54.333 --> 01:11:56.667
God he loved that car.

01:11:59.706 --> 01:12:05.242
It was so hot that day, so
I decided to fix a drink.

01:12:05.244 --> 01:12:09.214
Just one, I was thinking,
and the ice kept melting.

01:12:09.216 --> 01:12:11.784
And... and the damn
air-conditioning

01:12:11.786 --> 01:12:12.185
wasn't working.

01:12:15.257 --> 01:12:19.727
And so I had some drinks,
but never too much.

01:12:19.729 --> 01:12:23.397
I never, ever thought
I had too much.

01:12:27.671 --> 01:12:31.808
But I guess I must have
fallen asleep, because I

01:12:31.810 --> 01:12:34.610
don't remember exactly.

01:12:34.612 --> 01:12:39.215
But my little baby girl somehow
found her way out to the car

01:12:39.217 --> 01:12:42.753
and managed to get herself
inside with the door shut.

01:12:42.755 --> 01:12:43.421
And got stuck.

01:12:46.426 --> 01:12:48.794
And it was so hot, Josh.

01:12:48.796 --> 01:12:53.398
It was so hot just to be
outdoors, let alone in the car.

01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:56.102
And she was just sitting there.

01:12:56.104 --> 01:12:58.238
Trapped.

01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:02.008
And I don't know how
long she was there.

01:13:02.010 --> 01:13:03.610
I don't remember.

01:13:03.612 --> 01:13:09.284
I was still asleep when
Danielle came to pick her up.

01:13:09.286 --> 01:13:12.853
Her little body was so limp.

01:13:12.855 --> 01:13:14.790
So weak.

01:13:14.792 --> 01:13:16.959
She was only three.

01:13:16.961 --> 01:13:17.761
Just three.

01:13:21.199 --> 01:13:25.235
Then Arnie came, and we
tried to go to the hospital.

01:13:25.237 --> 01:13:28.807
But Danielle wouldn't
let us see her...

01:13:28.809 --> 01:13:32.043
not even Arnie, and
Arnie didn't do anything!

01:13:36.951 --> 01:13:39.218
Danielle took her away from us.

01:13:39.220 --> 01:13:43.790
After that, she wouldn't say
where she was taking her.

01:13:43.792 --> 01:13:48.562
We haven't seen or
heard from them since.

01:13:48.564 --> 01:13:51.933
It's been 18 years.

01:13:51.935 --> 01:13:53.301
A lifetime.

01:14:01.212 --> 01:14:05.549
Do you remember what you
told me when my mom passed?

01:14:05.551 --> 01:14:06.650
Who knows.

01:14:06.652 --> 01:14:11.589
You said, those we love
can never be taken away.

01:14:11.591 --> 01:14:13.156
Well, that's not true.

01:14:13.158 --> 01:14:14.325
It is true.

01:14:14.327 --> 01:14:15.593
Not for me.

01:14:15.595 --> 01:14:18.062
Not with Allison.

01:14:18.064 --> 01:14:18.963
I've lost Allison.

01:14:35.085 --> 01:14:37.585
I know where she is.

01:14:37.587 --> 01:14:39.088
Who?

01:14:39.090 --> 01:14:39.489
Wren.

01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:44.459
I know where she goes.

01:14:57.909 --> 01:15:00.077
I can't tell you how,
uh, gratifying this whole thing

01:15:00.079 --> 01:15:01.211
has been for me.

01:15:01.213 --> 01:15:02.080
I wish I'd seen it.

01:15:02.082 --> 01:15:02.981
You know?

01:15:02.983 --> 01:15:03.882
I wish you had, too.

01:15:03.884 --> 01:15:04.916
I wish I could see it.

01:15:04.918 --> 01:15:05.919
Well, you didn't.

01:15:06.688 --> 01:15:07.821
No, I didn't!

01:15:07.823 --> 01:15:09.089
Look at these babies.

01:15:09.091 --> 01:15:10.322
This is amazing.

01:15:10.324 --> 01:15:11.726
They're not
all birders, you know.

01:15:11.728 --> 01:15:14.093
They usually hang over
there on my neighbor's lawn.

01:15:14.095 --> 01:15:15.160
Oh, that guy?

01:15:15.162 --> 01:15:16.996
Everyone
abandoned him for a bird.

01:15:52.605 --> 01:15:54.607
Jo!

01:15:54.609 --> 01:15:57.611
Jo Jo!

01:15:57.613 --> 01:16:04.886
Where the... Jo Jo?

01:16:40.796 --> 01:16:41.894
This place.

01:16:41.896 --> 01:16:44.031
Yeah.

01:16:44.033 --> 01:16:45.766
Now we can add
trespassing to the list.

01:16:48.738 --> 01:16:51.173
Jo!

01:16:57.514 --> 01:17:01.116
Where are you?

01:17:01.118 --> 01:17:04.387
Uh, y-you go ahead.

01:17:04.389 --> 01:17:04.788
OK.

01:17:10.197 --> 01:17:12.930
So what you all
may not know about me

01:17:12.932 --> 01:17:15.967
is that I have a son.

01:17:15.969 --> 01:17:21.040
And he lives in Cleveland, and
the last time I saw my son,

01:17:21.042 --> 01:17:26.544
we played music
and I sang for him.

01:17:26.546 --> 01:17:28.982
And that was the
happiest I've seen

01:17:28.984 --> 01:17:30.684
my son in a long, long time.

01:17:33.555 --> 01:17:36.557
What I want you to do is sing.

01:17:36.559 --> 01:17:38.092
I want you to sing for somebody.

01:17:38.094 --> 01:17:40.963
I want you to make
somebody happy.

01:17:40.965 --> 01:17:41.364
OK?

01:18:05.659 --> 01:18:07.561
Josh.

01:18:07.563 --> 01:18:11.063
Oh, hey.

01:18:11.065 --> 01:18:14.535
Where's your friend?

01:18:24.047 --> 01:18:31.519
The birds,
they sang at the break of day.

01:18:31.521 --> 01:18:37.494
Start again, I heard them say.

01:18:37.496 --> 01:18:46.371
Don't dwell on what has passed
away, or what is yet to be.

01:18:51.479 --> 01:18:53.979
All the wars,

01:18:53.981 --> 01:18:57.951
they will be fought again.

01:18:57.953 --> 01:19:03.358
The holy dove, she
will be caught again.

01:19:06.462 --> 01:19:07.695
How well do you know here?

01:19:07.697 --> 01:19:09.363
Bought,
sold, and bought again.

01:19:09.365 --> 01:19:11.799
I deliver her mail.

01:19:11.801 --> 01:19:13.668
The dove is never free.

01:19:18.676 --> 01:19:23.479
Ring the bells that
still can ring.

01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:30.723
Forget your perfect offering.

01:19:33.761 --> 01:19:40.566
There's a crack, a
crack in everything.

01:19:40.568 --> 01:19:42.902
That's how the light gets in.

01:19:47.911 --> 01:19:51.646
We asked for signs.

01:19:51.648 --> 01:19:55.116
The signs were sent.

01:19:55.118 --> 01:20:02.592
The birth betrayed,
the marriage spent.

01:20:02.594 --> 01:20:10.535
The widowhood of every
government, signs for all

01:20:10.537 --> 01:20:11.436
to see.

01:20:29.426 --> 01:20:31.425
But they've summoned,

01:20:31.427 --> 01:20:35.397
they've summoned
up a thundercloud.

01:20:35.399 --> 01:20:39.869
They're gonna hear from me.

01:20:39.871 --> 01:20:43.339
They're gonna hear from me.

01:20:43.341 --> 01:20:50.312
Ring the
bells that still can ring.

01:20:50.314 --> 01:20:56.754
Forget your perfect offering.

01:20:56.756 --> 01:21:04.731
There is a crack, a
crack in everything.

01:21:04.733 --> 01:21:08.101
That's how the light gets in.

01:21:17.046 --> 01:21:21.116
You
can add up the parts.

01:21:21.118 --> 01:21:24.018
You won't have the sum.

01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:27.889
You can strike up the march.

01:21:27.891 --> 01:21:29.291
There is no drum.

01:21:32.364 --> 01:21:36.333
Every heart to love

01:21:36.335 --> 01:21:40.203
will come, but like a refugee.

01:21:45.246 --> 01:21:50.115
Ring the bells that
still can ring.

01:21:53.186 --> 01:21:56.555
Forget your perfect offering.

01:22:00.130 --> 01:22:07.068
There is a crack, a
crack in everything.

01:22:07.070 --> 01:22:11.040
That's how the light gets in.

01:22:11.042 --> 01:22:15.010
That's how the light gets in.

01:22:16.015 --> 01:22:21.486
Ring the bells that
still can ring.

01:22:21.488 --> 01:22:24.856
Forget your perfect offering.

01:22:28.095 --> 01:22:35.500
There is a crack, a
crack in everything.

01:22:35.502 --> 01:22:39.473
That's how the light gets in.

01:22:39.475 --> 01:22:41.575
That's
how the light gets in.

01:22:41.577 --> 01:22:42.942
That's
how the light gets in.

01:22:42.944 --> 01:22:44.912
That's
how the light gets in.

01:22:44.914 --> 01:22:46.414
That's
how the light gets in.

01:22:46.416 --> 01:22:48.884
That's
how the light gets in.

01:22:48.886 --> 01:22:51.253
That's how the light gets in.

01:23:04.269 --> 01:23:06.204
What a gift.

01:23:06.206 --> 01:23:06.605
Margie?

01:23:30.466 --> 01:23:30.865
Walter?

01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:42.278
Honey?

01:23:59.699 --> 01:24:00.099
No.

01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:06.039
Walter.

01:24:20.590 --> 01:24:20.989
No.

01:24:33.506 --> 01:24:34.738
Well, watch your step.

01:24:34.740 --> 01:24:36.339
Here we are.

01:24:36.341 --> 01:24:39.076
Thank you.

01:24:39.078 --> 01:24:40.044
Jo Ann.

01:24:40.046 --> 01:24:41.379
Are you all right?

01:24:41.381 --> 01:24:42.213
Oh, I'm all right.

01:24:42.215 --> 01:24:44.081
Oh.

01:24:44.083 --> 01:24:45.518
She's all right.

01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:47.419
Thank you.

01:24:47.421 --> 01:24:48.821
Come, come, come.

01:24:48.823 --> 01:24:50.290
Come with me.

01:24:50.292 --> 01:24:53.559
I have been looking all
over the place for you.

01:24:55.564 --> 01:24:56.565
Come on.

01:24:56.567 --> 01:24:57.531
Lie down.

01:24:57.533 --> 01:24:58.432
There you go.

01:25:02.172 --> 01:25:05.241
Oh, you would have loved it.

01:25:05.243 --> 01:25:07.309
There were birds, Arnie.

01:25:07.311 --> 01:25:09.613
Oh, lots of birds.

01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:19.690
I was worried about you.

01:25:19.692 --> 01:25:23.626
I'll
get you a blanket.

01:25:23.628 --> 01:25:24.028
OK.

01:25:45.421 --> 01:25:46.821
I'd like to pay you for it.

01:25:46.823 --> 01:25:48.388
Oh, no, Margaret.

01:25:48.390 --> 01:25:51.326
It's a gift for you and Walter.

01:25:51.328 --> 01:25:53.728
I can make another one easy.

01:25:53.730 --> 01:25:55.197
Oh.

01:25:55.199 --> 01:25:56.064
Thank you.

01:26:00.838 --> 01:26:04.942
He liked to keep
change in his pocket.

01:26:04.944 --> 01:26:08.112
I added it all up
yesterday. $1.68.

01:26:11.918 --> 01:26:14.919
It doesn't seem like much.

01:26:14.921 --> 01:26:16.321
It feels good.

01:26:38.048 --> 01:26:39.915
Allison.

01:26:39.917 --> 01:26:43.586
Somehow just writing her
name gives me strength.

01:26:43.588 --> 01:26:49.660
If she were standing in front
of me, what would I say?

01:26:49.662 --> 01:26:52.363
I am her grandmother.

01:26:52.365 --> 01:26:56.800
I want to know if she's
happy, if she's still brave.

01:26:56.802 --> 01:26:59.738
Does she look like her father?

01:26:59.740 --> 01:27:03.375
I hurt the person
I loved the most.

01:27:03.377 --> 01:27:07.914
Perhaps if I can forgive myself,
then Allison will forgive me.

01:27:07.916 --> 01:27:09.215
Wait a second.

01:27:09.217 --> 01:27:10.017
Wait a second.

01:27:10.019 --> 01:27:11.952
Dance with me.

01:27:11.954 --> 01:27:13.854
Oh, go back to your paper.

01:27:13.856 --> 01:27:15.557
I don't want to
go back to my paper.

01:27:15.559 --> 01:27:16.991
I want to dance with my wife.

01:27:16.993 --> 01:27:18.561
I know what you're
doing, you know?

01:27:18.563 --> 01:27:20.394
I'll be down
to get you in a taxi.

01:27:20.396 --> 01:27:22.097
You're trying to
make me feel better,

01:27:22.099 --> 01:27:23.898
but I already feel fine.

01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:26.335
Oh,
honey, don't be late.

01:27:26.337 --> 01:27:29.472
Wanna be there when the
band starts playing.

01:27:32.811 --> 01:27:33.744
Hello.

01:27:33.746 --> 01:27:36.481
I'm here to pick
up a prescription.

01:27:36.483 --> 01:27:38.383
Sorry, we closed at 6:00 PM.

01:27:38.385 --> 01:27:40.050
Oh, they said 7:00 PM.

01:27:40.052 --> 01:27:40.751
Not on Mondays.

01:27:40.753 --> 01:27:41.253
Sorry.

01:27:41.255 --> 01:27:42.789
6:00 PM.

01:27:42.791 --> 01:27:45.959
But you do see that it
is one minute past 6:00 PM?

01:27:45.961 --> 01:27:48.461
I really need to
take my medication.

01:27:48.463 --> 01:27:49.996
Then you should
have come earlier.

01:27:49.998 --> 01:27:51.098
Fine.

01:27:51.100 --> 01:27:52.665
Can I have it back
so that I can have it

01:27:52.667 --> 01:27:54.768
filled somewhere else, please?

01:27:54.770 --> 01:27:55.768
Sorry.

01:27:55.770 --> 01:27:56.803
Can't give back
filled prescriptions.

01:27:56.805 --> 01:27:59.473
It's against company policy.

01:27:59.475 --> 01:28:01.009
It's against your policy.

01:28:01.011 --> 01:28:01.410
Right.

01:28:04.148 --> 01:28:08.183
Do you know what
a pygmy falcon is?

01:28:08.185 --> 01:28:09.085
No?

01:28:09.087 --> 01:28:11.287
You should look it up.

01:28:14.493 --> 01:28:17.727
Listen, I've got a filled
prescription back there.

01:28:17.729 --> 01:28:19.030
We know that, right?

01:28:19.032 --> 01:28:21.299
My doctor wants me to have it.

01:28:21.301 --> 01:28:22.800
I want to have it.

01:28:22.802 --> 01:28:26.571
And your company's policy
dictates that I can't have it?

01:28:27.940 --> 01:28:29.308
It's just you and me here.

01:28:29.310 --> 01:28:30.709
This doesn't have
to be about policy

01:28:30.711 --> 01:28:33.312
or timeliness or anything else.

01:28:33.314 --> 01:28:35.548
This could be just
something that happened,

01:28:35.550 --> 01:28:38.785
some little event.

01:28:38.787 --> 01:28:40.019
Maybe you'll learn something.

01:28:40.021 --> 01:28:42.488
Maybe you won't know till later.

01:28:42.490 --> 01:28:46.495
But it could change your life.

01:28:46.497 --> 01:28:50.365
The littlest thing
can change your life.

01:28:56.475 --> 01:28:58.075
Last name?

01:28:58.077 --> 01:28:59.410
Burkheart.

01:28:59.412 --> 01:29:00.278
B-U-R-K-heart.

01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:07.785
Officer Burkheart.

01:29:07.787 --> 01:29:09.588
How you
doing, Mrs. Lemke?

01:29:09.590 --> 01:29:10.488
So sorry for your loss.

01:29:10.490 --> 01:29:11.456
Welcome.

01:29:11.458 --> 01:29:12.790
Oh, I didn't
know the man,

01:29:12.792 --> 01:29:14.259
but I felt like
I should stop by.

01:29:14.261 --> 01:29:15.027
I'm glad you're here.

01:29:15.029 --> 01:29:15.995
Thank you.

01:29:15.997 --> 01:29:16.995
Thank you for coming.

01:29:16.997 --> 01:29:17.998
My pleasure.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:19.464
Thank you.

01:29:19.466 --> 01:29:20.867
Oh, it's all right.

01:29:34.318 --> 01:29:36.785
I heard some of the
members of the Audubon Society

01:29:36.787 --> 01:29:38.921
are trying to dispute your
Bali starling sighting.

01:29:38.923 --> 01:29:40.757
They wouldn't be doing
their job if they didn't.

01:29:40.759 --> 01:29:45.929
You have to be very cautious
about what you think you know.

01:29:45.931 --> 01:29:48.331
Every claim has to be
adequately challenged.

01:29:48.333 --> 01:29:49.701
Hm.

01:29:49.703 --> 01:29:53.103
You know, I never really thought
much at all about, uh, or...

01:29:53.105 --> 01:29:53.737
Ornithology.

01:29:53.739 --> 01:29:54.339
Ornithology.

01:29:54.341 --> 01:29:55.442
Right.

01:29:55.444 --> 01:29:56.842
Thank you.

01:29:56.844 --> 01:29:59.478
I find it to be a
very rewarding discipline.

01:29:59.480 --> 01:30:00.879
Mm-hm.

01:30:00.881 --> 01:30:04.552
There's so much out that
still needs to be discovered.

01:30:04.554 --> 01:30:08.054
For example, we still
lack conclusive proof

01:30:08.056 --> 01:30:11.125
as to when the honey
guide bird first formed

01:30:11.127 --> 01:30:15.228
its partnership with the ratel.

01:30:16.265 --> 01:30:23.874
Though April showers
may come your way,

01:30:23.876 --> 01:30:31.949
they bring the flowers
that bloom in May.

01:30:31.951 --> 01:30:40.058
So when it's raining,
have no regrets.

01:30:40.060 --> 01:30:45.464
'Cause it isn't
raining rain, you know.

01:30:45.466 --> 01:30:48.166
It's raining violets.

01:30:48.168 --> 01:30:55.977
And when you see
clouds upon the hill,

01:30:55.979 --> 01:31:00.682
you know they'll bring
crowds of daffodils.

01:31:03.787 --> 01:31:13.062
So keep looking for a blue
bird and listen for his song

01:31:13.064 --> 01:31:17.768
whenever April
showers come along.

01:31:36.492 --> 01:31:41.762
So when it's raining,
have no regrets.

01:31:44.868 --> 01:31:49.670
'Cause it isn't
raining rain, you know.

01:31:49.672 --> 01:31:52.375
It's raining violets.

01:31:52.377 --> 01:32:00.784
And when you see
clouds upon the hill,

01:32:00.786 --> 01:32:05.489
you know they'll bring
crowds of daffodils.

01:32:08.895 --> 01:32:17.873
So keep looking for a blue
bird and listen for his song

01:32:17.875 --> 01:32:23.246
whenever April
showers come along.
